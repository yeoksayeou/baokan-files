    Qiu Zhizhong Willingly Serves the Zhang-Luo Alliance
    Employees of the Ministry of Forestry Expose His Hypocritical Mask
    (Our Dispatch) In the offensive of denouncing the rightist ringleader Luo Longji and Zhao Wenbi, who colluded with Luo, the Ministry of Forestry has taken down another rightist Qiu Zhizhong, who sang "blackface" for the Zhang-Luo Alliance.
    Qiu Zhizhong was a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, directly developed by Zhang Bojun. Last year, he entered the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry through Luo Longji's introduction and became the chief engineer. As soon as he entered the Ministry of Forestry, he began to develop an organization for the Peasants' and Workers' Party to build up his political capital. Zhang Bojun once instructed him: "You are the only party member (referring to the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party) in the two ministries of forestry and forest industry, so the important issue is to develop the organization. I can give you special authority." As a result, Qiu Zhizhong became arrogant. He used methods of treating guests and making promises in the Ministry of Forestry to recruit people into the Peasants' and Workers' Party by any means.
    After the rectification campaign began, Qiu Zhizhong thought "the opportunity had come." He colluded with Zhao Wenbi, Luo Longji's "general," to sow discord among the cadres of the Ministry of Forestry and attack the leadership. He slandered the deputy director of the Technical Review Division who led him, saying, "He is a carpenter, how can he lead me?" In reality, he was plotting to usurp leadership.
    During the period of full and frank airing of views, he once told Zhao Wenbi: "You often have contact with the Party Committee, so it is inconvenient to speak. Let me play the blackface." So he incited everywhere, saying, "The mistakes in the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were very large, and even the side effects exceeded the achievements." He even viciously said, "Now, among the five million intellectuals, three million have suffered losses from the Communist Party." He also actively supported Luo Longji's reactionary fallacy of a "rehabilitation committee." He once proposed to the rightist Zhao Wenbi: "We must recruit technicians so that we have political power and are not arbitrarily slaughtered. Because party members do not understand technology, we must first gain technical leadership to control the Ministry of Forestry." Zhao Wenbi told him, "Your matter has been reported to the top for you. The ministry leader (referring to Luo Longji) said that we must be patient before the organization is sound and the food is cooked, and it will be resolved in the future." Zhao Wenbi also told him: "It is very convenient for you to live in the city. You can go to representative figures more often to feel the climate. It is inconvenient for me because people are paying attention to me." Qiu Zhizhong immediately agreed, "I am willing to serve."
    Even after the anti-rightist struggle began, Qiu Zhizhong was still active everywhere, running errands for the Zhang-Luo alliance, and offering advice to Zhao Wenbi, saying, "Let Luo Longji stabilize. If it really doesn't work, he can not be a Chinese citizen and seek refuge in a foreign embassy." What kind of person is Qiu Zhizhong? Before liberation, he was the president of a reactionary "Municipal Construction" monthly magazine. In early 1949, after the People's Liberation Army liberated Mingguang area near Nanjing, the Kuomintang reactionary Li Zongren played the trick of fake peace talks. Under Li Zongren's instruction, Qiu Zhizhong served as the chief representative of the so-called "People's Peace Delegation" to seek false peace in Beijing, trying to delay time to gain a respite. At that time, our Beijing Military Control Commission had seen through their hypocrisy and did not recognize them as negotiation counterparts. However, Qiu Zhizhong even claimed "credit for peace talks" after liberation and swaggered and deceived everywhere. In the autumn of 1950, he organized the "China Urban Engineering Construction Company," buying and selling without capital. He defrauded state assets when contracting national construction projects. During the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, Qiu Zhizhong was a big tiger.
    The employees of the Ministry of Forestry have seen through the evil face of this rightist Qiu Zhizhong, who sang "blackface" for the Zhang-Luo alliance, and are now focusing their efforts on launching a reasoning struggle against him.

### 丘致中甘愿为章罗联盟效劳  森工部职工揭开他的假面具

    丘致中甘愿为章罗联盟效劳
    森工部职工揭开他的假面具
    本报讯　森林工业部在声讨右派大头目罗隆基和同罗狼狈为奸的赵文璧的攻势中，又攻下一个为章罗联盟唱“黑头”的右派分子丘致中。
    丘致中是章伯钧直接发展的农工民主党的党员。去年他经罗隆基介绍，钻进森林工业部的基本建设局，当上了主任工程师。他一进森林工业部就开始为农工党发展组织，搞政治资本。章伯钧曾向他授意：“林业、森林两部只你一个党员（指农工民主党），所以重要的问题是发展组织，我可以给你特殊权力。”于是丘致中就狂妄起来。他在森工部用请客、许愿的办法，不择手段拉人参加农工党。
    整风开始后，丘致中以为“机会到了”，他和罗隆基手下的“大将”赵文璧勾结起来，在森工部的干部中挑拨离间，打击领导。他诬蔑领导他的技术审核处的副处长“是一个木匠，怎能领导我。”实际上他是阴谋篡夺领导权。
    在大鸣大放阶段，他曾向赵文璧表示：“你们常与党委接触，不便讲话，那让我当黑头好了。”于是他就到处煽动，说“三反、肃反的错误是很大的，甚至副作用超过了成绩。”他甚至恶毒地说：“现在五百万知识分子有三百万是吃过共产党的亏。”他还积极支持罗隆基的“平反委员会”的反动谬论。他曾向右派分子赵文璧提出：
  “要拉技术人员，政治上才有力量，免被人随意宰割。因为党员不懂技术，我们先取得技术上的领导，才可以控制森工部。”赵文璧告诉他：“你的事已替你通天了，部领导（指罗隆基）表示，在机构未健全，饭还未煮熟前须忍耐，将来会解决”。赵文璧又告诉他：“你住到城里很方便，可以多到有代表性的人物处走走，摸摸气候，我不方便，有人注意我。”丘致中当即答应“愿为效劳。”
    直到反右派斗争开始后，丘致中还到处活动，为章罗联盟奔走，并向赵文璧献策说：“让罗隆基稳住，实在不行，可以不做中国人，到外国使馆避避难再说。”丘致中是怎样一个人呢？他在解放前原是一个反动的“市政建设”月刊的社长。1949年初人民解放军解放了南京附近的明光地区后，国民党反动派李宗仁玩弄假和谈的诡计。丘致中在李宗仁的授意下，担任了所谓的“人民和平代表团”的首席代表，来北京伪求和平，想拖延时间获得喘息机会。当时我北京军管会已识破他们的假面具，不承认他们为和谈对象。但是丘致中在解放后竟冒称“和谈有功”，到处招摇撞骗。并在1950年秋组织“中国城市工程建设公司”，买空卖空。在承包国家建筑工程时，曾骗取国家资财。在三反、五反运动时，丘致中是一个大老虎。
    森工部的职工们已识破这个给章罗联盟唱“黑头”的右派分子丘致中的恶毒面目，现正集中火力向他展开了说理斗争。
