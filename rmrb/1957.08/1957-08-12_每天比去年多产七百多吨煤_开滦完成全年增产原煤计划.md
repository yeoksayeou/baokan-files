Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 11th -- Kailuan Coal Mine, one of China's largest coal mines, had increased its raw coal production by 201,784 tons by August 9th, exceeding its annual plan to increase raw coal production by 200,000 tons more than four months ahead of schedule. Since the beginning of this year, the average daily output has been more than 700 tons higher than in the same period last year, and the quality of raw coal has also reached the national standards.

From the beginning of this year, Kailuan Coal Mine experienced a serious shortage of pit props. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party's Kailuan Coal Mine Committee, the mine's workers put forward slogans such as "Save pit props to produce more coal, ensuring that brother factories have enough coal to burn" and launched an increase production and economize movement. Engineering and technical personnel and workers have successively researched and developed 26 advanced experiences in saving pit props. By the end of July, the consumption of pit props per 1,000 tons of coal had dropped to 25.5 cubic meters, saving 3,157 cubic meters of pit props in seven months compared to the national planned target, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient pit props and ensuring increased production.

In the increase production and economize movement, the coal mine also strengthened production preparation work such as exploration and tunneling. On this basis, the advanced experience of regular cycle operation was promoted in each mining area, eliminating the chaotic phenomenon of first being relaxed and then rushed, and then crash production in the past years, and production efficiency was continuously improved. By the beginning of August, the overall efficiency reached 1.06 tons, an increase of 1.66% compared with the second quarter and 5.98% compared with the same period last year.

    每天比去年多产七百多吨煤
    开滦完成全年增产原煤计划
    新华社唐山11日电　我国最大的煤矿之一——开滦煤矿，到8月9日止，已经增产原煤二十万一千七百八十四吨，提前四个多月超额完成了今年全年增产二十万吨原煤的计划。今年以来，平均每天的产量比去年同期多生产七百多吨煤，原煤的质量也达到了国家规定的指标。
    从今年年初开始，开滦煤矿曾发生坑木供应不足的严重现象。这个煤矿的职工，在中共开滦煤矿党委领导下，提出了“节约坑木多出煤，保证兄弟厂有足够煤烧”等口号，开展起增产节约运动。工程技术人员和工人先后研究出二十六种节约坑木的先进经验。到7月底，每产一千吨煤的坑木消耗降到二十五点五立方公尺，七个月比国家计划指标节省三千一百五十七立方公尺坑木，克服了坑木不足的困难，保证了增产。
    这个煤矿在增产节约运动中，还加强开拓、掘进等生产准备工作。在这个基础上，各回采区推行正轨循环作业的先进经验，消除了历年来先松后紧，突击生产的混乱现象，生产效率不断提高。到8月上旬，全员效率达到了一点零六吨，比第二季度提高1.66％，比去年同期提高5.98％。
