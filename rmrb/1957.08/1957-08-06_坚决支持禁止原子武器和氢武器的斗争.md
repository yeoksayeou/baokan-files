Resolutely Support the Struggle to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons
Xu Guangping, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

August 6th is the twelfth anniversary of the atomic bombing of the Japanese people. Twelve years ago today, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the center of Hiroshima, and three days later, Nagasaki was also attacked by another atomic bomb, bringing unprecedented atomic devastation to the Japanese people. The tragic disasters suffered by the Japanese people have not only awakened the Japanese people, but also awakened the people of the world to the utter hatred of the atomic bomb throwers and their determination to fight against atomic weapons and defend peace.

In the past few years, the struggle of the people of the world against atomic and hydrogen weapons has made significant progress. Especially after the United States tested hydrogen bombs in Bikini Atoll and Britain tested them on Christmas Island, the struggle of people in various countries against atomic and hydrogen weapons has formed a magnificent worldwide peace movement. The Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, held in Tokyo on August 6 this year, is another major review of the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement by the Japanese people and the people of the world, and also a powerful demonstration by the world's peace forces, united against those who attempt to create atomic war disasters. At its Helsinki meeting in June this year, the Women's International Democratic Federation strongly called on women of all countries to strengthen their actions and make August 6 a World Day of Protest against Nuclear Weapons Testing, which expresses the general wish of hundreds of millions of women around the world. They urgently demand to act together with the people of all countries to further promote the struggle against atomic and hydrogen weapons.

In the struggle of the people of the world against atomic and hydrogen weapons, women and mothers of all countries have played an increasingly important role and made significant contributions. First of all, Japanese women have not been frightened by this tragic disaster, and they stand at the forefront of the struggle against atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Second Mothers' Conference held last August was attended by 1,500 representatives from all parts of Japan, from different strata, occupations, religious, and political beliefs, indicating that Japanese women are more widely united under the slogan of opposing atomic and hydrogen weapons and defending peace. Now the Third Japanese Mothers' Conference was held in Tokyo on the 3rd of this month. We believe that the Japanese women's movement to defend peace will achieve greater development and success.

When the British government decided to test hydrogen bombs on Christmas Island in the Pacific, British women launched a wave of protests. Women wore black shirts to petition Parliament and demonstrated in pouring rain. Their resolute and powerful voices forced the British Foreign Secretary to make a special explanation to women for the first time in a broadcast women's program. But even so, British women were not deceived. A London mother still sent a telegram to the British Prime Minister saying: "God can forgive you, but mothers cannot!"

In West Germany, women of the Social Democratic Party are also actively fighting against atomic and hydrogen weapons. Women of the Social Democratic Party in cities such as Bonn and Bremen demanded that the West German government abandon equipping the West German army with atomic weapons and oppose the storage of atomic weapons on German territory.

In addition, women in many countries in France, Italy, Canada, Australia, India, Ceylon, Northern Europe, and Latin America have expressed their protests against the manufacture and testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons in various ways. Miss Balch, a well-known American woman (Honorary Chairman of the International Women's League for Peace and Freedom), also expressed her support for opposing the use of atomic weapons and opposing atomic threats.

We Chinese women, like all peace-loving women in the world, have always advocated the prohibition of the manufacture, testing, and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. We advocate that atomic energy should be used for peaceful construction, not for war. Therefore, we actively respond to the call of the Women's International Democratic Federation, resolutely support the struggle of women and people of all countries against atomic and hydrogen weapons, and are willing to work together for the noble cause of opposing war and defending peace.

On August 6, this solemn day of common commemoration for the people of the world, we Chinese women would like to take this opportunity to once again express our deep sympathy and condolences to the Japanese people who have suffered several atomic disasters, and pay our highest respect to the people and women of the world who are determined to fight against atomic and hydrogen weapons. We believe that the broadest unity of the people of the world will surely be able to stop the serious threat of atomic and hydrogen weapons to mankind and future generations.

    坚决支持禁止原子武器和氢武器的斗争
    中华全国民主妇联副主席　许广平
    8月6日是日本人民遭受原子弹轰炸的第十二周年。十二年前的今天，美国把一颗原子弹投掷到广岛的中心，三天后，长崎也遭受了另一颗原子弹的袭击，这样便给日本人民带来了旷古未有的原子浩劫。日本人民所遭受的惨痛灾难，不仅唤起了日本人民、也唤起了世界人民对原子弹投掷者的切齿痛恨和他们为反对原子武器、保卫和平而斗争的决心。
    几年以来，世界人民反对原子武器和氢武器的斗争有了重大的发展，特别是美国在比基尼岛和英国在圣诞岛试验氢弹之后，目前各国人民反对原子武器氢武器的斗争，已经形成了一个波澜壮阔的世界性和平运动了。今年的8月6日在东京召开的第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，是日本人民和世界人民又一次反对原子弹氢弹运动的大检阅，也是世界和平力量团结起来，向企图制造原子战争灾难的人们所进行的一次强大的示威。国际民主妇联在今年6月的赫尔辛基理事会上，大力号召各国妇女加强行动，把8月6日这一天变成一个抗议核武器试验的世界日，这正表达了世界亿万妇女的普遍愿望，她们迫切要求和各国人民一齐行动，使反对原子武器氢武器的斗争更加高涨。
    在世界人民反对原子武器氢武器的斗争中，各国妇女和母亲们起了日益重要的作用，作出了重大的贡献。首先是日本妇女，她们并没有被这惨痛的灾难所吓倒，她们站在反对原子武器氢武器的斗争最前列。去年8月举行的第二届母亲大会，有来自日本各地、各不同阶层、不同职业和宗教、政治信仰的一千五百名代表参加，这表明日本妇女在反对原子武器氢武器、保卫和平的口号下是更加广泛地团结起来了。现在第三届日本母亲大会已于本月3日在东京召开，我们相信，日本妇女保卫和平的运动将取得更大的发展和成就。
    英国妇女当英国政府决定在太平洋的圣诞岛上试验氢弹的时候，她们掀起了抗议的热潮，妇女们穿着黑衫到议会请愿，冒着倾盆大雨示威游行，她们坚决有力的呼声迫使英国外交大臣有史以来第一次在广播的妇女节目中专门向妇女进行解释，但即使如此，英国的妇女们并没有被欺骗，一位伦敦的母亲仍然打了一封电报给英国首相说：“上帝能饶恕你，可是母亲们不能！”
    在西德，社会民主党的妇女也为反对原子武器氢武器而积极斗争。波恩、不来梅等城市的社会民主党妇女要求西德政府放弃以原子武器装备西德军队，反对在德国领土上贮存原子武器。
    此外，在法国、意大利、加拿大、澳大利亚、印度、锡兰、北欧及拉丁美洲的许多国家的妇女，都以各种不同方式表达了她们对原子武器氢武器的制造和试验的抗议。美国一位知名妇女巴尔奇小姐（国际妇女争取和平与自由联盟的名誉主席）也表示赞同反对使用原子武器和反对原子威胁。
    我们中国妇女和全世界爱好和平的妇女一样，一贯主张禁止制造、试验和使用原子武器氢武器，我们主张原子能用于和平建设事业，而不是用于战争，因此我们积极响应国际民主妇联的号召，坚决支持各国妇女和各国人民反对原子武器氢武器的斗争，愿共同为反对战争、保卫和平这一崇高的事业而奋斗。
    在8月6日这个世界人民共同纪念的庄严日子里，我们中国妇女愿意借着这个机会再一次向遭受过几次原子灾难的日本人民表示深切的同情和慰问，并向坚决为反对原子武器和氢武器而斗争的世界人民和妇女致以崇高的敬意。我们相信，全世界人民最广泛的团结，将一定能够制止原子武器氢武器对人类和子孙后代的严重威胁。
