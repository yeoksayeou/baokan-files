Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 19th. At the anti-Rightist struggle conference held today at the Changchun Film Studio, it was revealed that the comedy director and Party Rightist Lü Ban is an anti-Party and anti-socialist element rotten to the core of his soul and only interested in profit. After liberation, Lü Ban used his position as a people's film director to distort the reality of the new society, slander the Communist Party, and attack the Party's leadership of the film industry.

Lü Ban has been engaged in film and drama work for more than twenty years. He has always opposed socialist realism in artistic creation. After liberation, he still tried his best to pursue bourgeois vulgar tastes in directing comedies. After he directed the film "No. 6 Gate" in 1954, he gradually became arrogant and defiant of leadership. When the Party put forward the "Hundred Flowers" policy, he began to use the Party's conditions for developing comedy creation, and adopted feudal gang methods such as flattery, praise, and wooing to collude with a group of right-wing elements in Changchun, Tianjin and other places in an attempt to organize an anti-Party group called "Spring Comedy Society." He also planned to set up a film studio in Tianjin to shoot bourgeois vulgar comedy films, attempting to split "Changying" and compete with "Beijing Film Studio." He called himself the "Second Brother" of the feudal bully, and said to his followers: "Follow your Second Brother and you will never go wrong. If you work with him for two years, I guarantee that you brothers will be able to eat and drink well, and have twelve to thirteen hundred deposits in the bank." They had already found a factory director and "political work" cadres who were to their liking. They also secretly planned to seize the leadership of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles. After their conspiracy was seen through by the Tianjin Party and government leaders and criticized by the film industry, Lü Ban cursed the Tianjin Party and government leaders for being "blind" and unable to recognize the "box office value" of his comedies. In Changying, Lü Ban and other right-wing elements used money and status to lure some backward elements to carry out anti-Party activities.

Lü Ban opposed comedy serving politics and the direction of comedy creation towards workers, peasants and soldiers. He said, "Comedy is just for making people laugh." After the Changying directors recently watched the "Unfinished Comedy" written and directed by him and Luo Tai, they all believed that it was a poisonous arrow satirizing and slandering the new society. In this film, he vilified the Party's leading cadres and portrayed the Party's literary and art critics as dogmatists who were "one-size-fits-all." After the anti-Rightist struggle, Lü Ban also openly told the actors to use the Party Central Committee and the film industry's literary and art leaders as models when playing this negative image, consciously using film art as a weapon to attack the Party. He also tried his best to boast in this film as an "art master" and a "famous comedy actor" since the May Fourth Movement.

At the meeting, directors and actors revealed that Lü Ban regarded actors as "commodities." When it was beneficial to him, he would say that the actor was a "jade," but when it was not beneficial to him, he would scold them. He called the comedy team "Lü Family Class" and openly said to some actors: "Our relationship is mutual use. I use your talent and you rely on me to become famous."

Lü Ban's bourgeois "art first" thought is also particularly prominent. During the "blooming and contending," he spread the word: "Changying is supported by the film crews, and the directors support the entire factory. Even the small car used by Director Yama is provided by the directors." He said: "If the director doesn't direct the show, the director has to kneel down to him."

Lü Ban called himself a "well-connected cadre" and often placed himself above the Party. Whenever things went wrong, he would scold the Party leaders. During the "blooming and contending," he attacked the person in charge of the Changying Party committee on the pretext and actively instigated some Party members to make trouble and petition. When the right-wing element Zhong Dianfei sent Luo Dou to Changying to set fire, he actively helped plan and organize the symposium.

Lü Ban joined the Party in 1942. He publicly said to the masses in Changying that he joined the Party to pursue a female Communist Party member. After joining the Party, Lü Ban still did not abandon the serious bourgeois thoughts and feudal bully style that existed in him. In 1949, when Lü Ban saw the film "The Spring River Flows East" after entering the city, he complained and said: "The Japanese were defeated too early, otherwise I could have become famous." At the Changying Youth's Congress to March Towards Science, he openly called on everyone to "strive for the renminbi." He also put on the airs of a feudal bully everywhere to oppress the masses. He scolded a deputy director: "How did he get up? Let him get down the same way."

At the anti-Rightist struggle conference, everyone angrily denounced Lü Ban's anti-Party criminal activities as a feudal bully, and accused him of various crimes of defrauding money and insulting actresses, and resolutely refused to let this right-wing element get away with it.

    吕班是个反党导演
    专用喜剧形式歪曲新社会现实生活
    充满资产阶级思想和封建把头作风
    新华社长春19日电　长春电影制片厂今天举行的全厂艺术干部反右派斗争大会，揭露出喜剧导演、党内右派分子吕班是一个在灵魂深处腐朽透顶、唯利是图的反党、反社会主义分子。吕班在解放后利用人民电影导演的职权，极力以喜剧形式歪曲新社会的现实生活，丑化共产党，攻击党对电影事业的领导。
    吕班从事电影、戏剧工作已有二十多年，他在艺术创作上，一贯反对社会主义现实主义。解放后，在导演喜剧中仍竭力追求资产阶级的低级趣味。在1954年他导演“六号门”影片后，更逐渐目无领导、狂妄自大起来。当党提出“百花齐放”方针以后，他即开始利用党发展喜剧创作的条件，采取吹、捧、拉拢等封建行帮的手段，串连长春、天津等地一批右派分子，企图组织“春天喜剧社”的反党集团，并打算在天津设立电影厂，拍摄资产阶级低级趣味的喜剧影片。企图以此来分裂“长影”，并和“北影”分庭抗礼。他以封建把头的“二哥”自居，对他的喽啰说：“跟你二哥走准没有错。干上他两年，保证诸位哥儿们能够吃香的，喝辣的，在银行里也有千二八百的存款。”他们已经物色好了称他们心的厂长和“政治工作”干部。他们还密谋要窃取天津文联的领导权。他们的阴谋被天津党政领导识破并受到电影界的批评后，吕班大骂天津党政领导“有眼无珠”，不能认识他的喜剧“票房价值”。在长影，吕班和其他右派分子利用金钱、地位引诱一些落后分子来进行反党活动。
    吕班反对喜剧为政治服务和喜剧创作的工农兵方向。他说“喜剧就是为了让人笑一笑”。长影导演们最近看了他同罗太编导的“未完成的喜剧”以后，都认为这是一部讽刺、诽谤新社会的毒箭。他在这部影片里丑化党的领导干部，把党的文艺批评家描写成“一棒子”的教条主义者。在反右派斗争后，吕班还公开地告诉演员扮演这个反面形象时，要以党中央和电影界的文艺领导人做模特儿，有意识地把电影艺术作为向党进攻的武器。他还在这部影片中竭力自吹自捧为“艺术大师”，是“五四”以来“著名的喜剧演员”。
    会上导演、演员们揭发：吕班把演员看成是“商品”，对他有利时，他就把演员说成是一块“玉”，对他无利时，就谩骂他们。他把喜剧组叫做“吕家班”，并公开对有的演员说：“我们的关系，就是互相利用，我利用你的才，你靠我出名。”
    吕班的资产阶级“艺术至上”的思想也是特别突出的。在“鸣”“放”中，他散布：“长影是摄制组养活大家，导演养活全厂。甚至厂长亚马乘用的小汽车都是靠导演供给的。”他说：“导演不排戏，厂长也得给他跪下。”
    吕班自命为“通天干部”，平时也经常把自己摆上党之上。一不如意，就大骂党的领导。在“鸣”“放”中，他借故攻击长影党委负责人并积极煽动一些党员闹事请愿。右派分子锺惦棐派罗斗到长影放火时，他就积极帮助筹划和组织座谈会。
    吕班是在1942年入党的，他曾在长影群众中公开说：他入党是为了追求一个女共产党员。入党后，吕班仍然没有放弃在他身上存在的严重的资产阶级思想和封建把头作风。1949年，吕班在进城以后看到了“一江春水向东流”影片时，他怨恨地说：“日本人打败得太早了，不然我也可以成名了。”他在长影青年向科学进军大会上，公开号召大家“为人民币而奋斗。”他还到处摆起封建把头的身份欺压群众。他骂一位副导演：“他怎么爬起来的，还叫他怎么爬下去”。
    在反右派斗争大会上，大家愤怒地斥责了吕班这个封建把头的反党罪恶活动，控诉了他诈骗钱财、污辱女演员的各种罪行，坚决不让这个右派分子混过关去。
