　　Do Whatever Work is Available
　　Wu Lü
    On August 14th, the "Railway Construction" newspaper of the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, in a front-page headline on its second page, reported on the deeds of a tunnel construction team's rock excavation workers, who disregarded personal gains and losses to do heavy manual labor, and published a short commentary praising them. This is a reversal of the previous general criticism in some newspapers that "skilled workers doing heavy manual labor" is a waste. This reversal is good and makes a lot of sense.
      Is "skilled workers doing heavy manual labor" a waste? It may be a waste, but it may not be a waste; it cannot be generalized. If skilled workers are not allowed to do skilled work, but are instead made to do heavy manual labor, this is a waste and should be criticized. If there is no skilled work and only heavy manual labor, and skilled workers are assigned to do heavy manual labor, this is necessary and there is nothing to criticize.
    The principle is simple. Every basic construction project is gradual and progressive. Depending on the different needs of the project, sometimes there is a lot of skilled work, requiring a large number of skilled workers, and sometimes there is little skilled work, not requiring many skilled workers. Therefore, skilled workers sometimes have to do some other work in addition to their primary work. Take railway construction as an example! When encountering high mountains, it is necessary to build tunnels, requiring a large number of rock excavation workers. When encountering rivers, it is necessary to build bridges, requiring a large number of mechanical workers. But once the tunnels are built and the bridges are erected, and the railway is constructed on flat ground, the earthwork and stonework projects increase, requiring a large number of manual laborers. Rock excavation workers and mechanical workers are all skilled workers. When the tunnel is built, the bridge is erected, and there is no skilled work to do, but the project urgently needs manual laborers, assigning some skilled workers with no work to do to do heavy manual labor is not only not a waste, but is also completely appropriate. If the skilled workers are left idle and manual laborers are hired separately, that would be a real waste.
  This principle is very simple, but some skilled workers always find it difficult to understand, because there are two knots in their hearts that have not been untied. One is that although skilled workers doing heavy manual labor is obeying the needs of the state, it is still a bit of a waste of talent; the other is that manual laborers' wages are lower than skilled workers' wages, especially when skilled workers are newly assigned to do heavy manual labor, and are not proficient in the operation, often failing to meet the quota, and are worried about a decrease in income.
    Regarding "waste of talent," this is an ideological problem that requires patient explanation. Skilled workers have a little more specialized technology than manual laborers, which is a fact. However, the rock excavation workers of the Fourth Engineering Bureau's tunnel construction team put it well: "The state has trained us to build a socialist society, not to use our skills as bargaining chips." Because the state has trained them and they have learned a little technology, to refuse the state's allocation is obviously not the true color of the working class. Moreover, the saying of "small use" and "big use" is also untenable. If we have to say there is any "small use" and "big use," then everything that the country needs is "big use" and is glorious. As for the fact that they are not proficient in the initial work of heavy manual labor and cannot reach the quota, etc., there are indeed many practical problems that need the help of enterprise leaders to solve.
      The old idea that "skilled workers doing heavy manual labor" is a waste needs to be discarded. Now we should advocate obeying allocation, doing whatever work is available, and oppose using technology as a bargaining chip for work.

　　有啥做啥
　　吴滤
    8月14日，铁道部第四工程局的“铁道建设”报，以二版头条的地位，报道了一支隧道作业队的开山工人，不计个人得失去做壮工活的事迹，并发表短评给予表扬。这是对过去一些报纸笼统地批评“技工做壮工活”是浪费的一个翻案。这一案翻得好，翻得很有道理。
      “技工做壮工活”是不是浪费呢？可能是浪费，也可能不是浪费，不可一概而论。若是放着技工活不让技工做，反让技工去做壮工活，这是浪费，应该批评；若是没有技工活只有壮工活，调技工去做壮工活，这是必要的，没有什么可以批评的地方。
    道理很简单。每一项基本建设工程都是循序渐进的。根据工程的不同需要，有时候技工活多，需要大批技工，有时候技工活少，不需要多少技工，因而技工除了做本职工作之外，有时也不免要去做一些别的工作。拿修铁路来说吧！遇到高山，要筑隧道，需要大批开山工。遇到河流，要架桥梁，需要大批机械工。但一旦筑好了隧道，架起了桥梁，铁路在平地上施工，土石方工程增多，又需要大批的壮工。开山工、机械工都是技工，当隧道筑好，桥梁架好，没有技工活可做，而工程上却很需要壮工的时候，调一些无活可做的技工去做壮工活，非但不是浪费，而且是完全合适的。若是让技工闲着，另外再去雇壮工，那倒是真正的浪费了。
  这个道理很简单，可是有些技工总是不容易想通，这原因是心里有两个疙瘩没有解开。一个是技工做壮工活虽是服从国家需要，总未免有点大才小用；另一个是壮工工资比技工工资低，特别是技工刚调去做壮工活，操作不熟练，常常达不到定额，担心收入降低。
    关于“大才小用”，是个思想问题，需要耐心解释。技工同壮工比起来，多了一点专门技术，这是事实。可是，第四工程局这支隧道作业队的开山工人说得好：“国家把我们培养出来，是要我们建设社会主义社会，不是要我们把技术当作讨价还价的本钱”。因为国家的培养，学了一点技术，就拒绝国家的分配，这显然不是工人阶级的本色。况且“小用”“大用”之说也是不能成立的，如果硬说有什么“小用”“大用”的话，那么，凡是国家需要，都是“大用”，都是光荣的。至于初作壮工活操作不熟练，达不到定额等等，倒有不少确是实际问题，需要企业领导干部帮助解决。
      “技工做壮工活”都是浪费，这个旧的观念需要抛弃了。现在应该提倡服从分配，有啥做啥，反对把技术当作对工作讨价还价的本钱。
