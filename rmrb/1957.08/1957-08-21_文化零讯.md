　　Cultural News in Brief
　　330 New Chinese Paintings Exhibited in Hangzhou
　　The Chinese painting section of the first provincial art exhibition jointly organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Culture and the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles was opened at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall in Hangzhou on the 16th.
　　Most of the 330 Chinese paintings on display are new works from 1957, with realistic themes accounting for more than one-third. Among them are "Foothills of Tiantai Mountain", "Fuchun River" painted from life, and "Dai People Drawing Water" and "Teaching Mother to Read", which reflect everyday life. "Portrait of A Niu" by Zhou Changgu, assistant teacher of the Color Ink Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts East China Branch, is a unique expression method that absorbs the advantages of Western painting art on the basis of Chinese painting to portray modern figures.
　　What interests visitors most is "Crab" painted by a nine-year-old child named Zheng Shangshu. This child, only nine years old, has initially mastered the techniques of Chinese painting and grasped the characteristics of crabs. People say that this painting is accurate in shape and very vivid.
　　The exhibition also displayed "Lotus" and "Wisteria and Bees" by Zhu Lesan, associate professor of Chinese painting at the Art Branch, who was demoted to a staff member by the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique. In these two paintings, the old Chinese painter very vividly outlines the characteristics of lotus flowers and bees.
　　The exhibition also includes "Night Mooring on the River" by the famous old Chinese painter Pan Tianshou and "Snow Scene Landscape" by Leng Sou, an 84-year-old man from Wenzhou Prefecture.
　　Designing Commemorative Stamps for the Yangtze River Bridge
　　The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is a major event in my country's socialist construction and the realization of the century-old wishes of the people of Wuhan. In order to print and issue commemorative stamps for the completion of the bridge, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications sent personnel to the Yangtze River Bridge construction site in April to experience life, and design work is currently underway. On the day the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is officially opened to traffic, the Wuhan Post Office will also consider using commemorative postmarks.

　　Collecting Traditional Folk Songs and Dances from Border Areas
　　The Dehong National Song and Dance Troupe has been going deep into ethnic minority areas in border regions since January this year to experience life and collect ethnic folk music, songs, and dances.
　　In the past six months, this ethnic art team has gone deep into the Dai, Jingpo, and Lisu ethnic minority areas and Han areas in Ruili, Tengchong, Yingjiang, Lianshan, Longchuan, Baoshan, Longling, and Luxi counties to experience life, which has been improved. They also learned the drumbeat playing and woodwind instrument (San Bi) playing of the Jingpo ethnic group, the Hulusi playing of the Dai ethnic group, and several new dances of the Water Dai, Dry Dai, and Jingpo ethnic groups. They have collected dozens of ethnic folk songs and tunes, and more than a dozen legends, including the beautiful Dai legend "Ebie and Sanluo".
　　After processing and sorting out these collected materials, the team will go to various places for touring performances to enrich the cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas. (According to Yunnan Daily)
　　Researching the Development History of Foshan Handicraft Industry
　　A historical data investigation team specializing in researching the "Development History of Foshan Handicraft Industry" has obtained a large amount of data since it started its investigation work in mid-July and is preparing to publish a special book after sorting it out.
　　Foshan is one of the four ancient towns in my country. From the Song Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, the handicraft industry was quite developed. Especially during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there were many workshops and 300,000 residents (now 130,000). There were 200 industries. The iron smelting, silk weaving, copper foil, and ceramics industries here sold well at home and abroad; now it is still famous for its Shiwan ceramics.
　　The Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, together with the Department of History of Sun Yat-sen University, the Department of History of South China Normal College, the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Culture, and the Guangzhou Museum, has formed a historical data investigation team for the "Development History of Foshan Handicraft Industry" to conduct this research work. (According to Guangzhou Daily)
　　Slides of the Anti-Rightist Struggle
　　The Fujian Provincial Slide Production Factory recently produced four sets of five-color slides with the content of the anti-Rightist struggle.
　　These four films are: "Exposing the True Face of Rightists", "Comprehensively Pursuing Rightists, Not Withdrawing Until Complete Victory", "Increasing Vigilance, Not Letting Rightists Slip Through", and "Rightists Meeting Obstacles".
　　The slide "Exposing the True Face of Rightists" includes "Grand Chorus", "Opening the Way with Gongs", "Exquisite Design", "Foul Atmosphere", and "Applauding from Behind".
　　The film "Rightists Meeting Obstacles" uses the form of comic strips to depict the situation of Luo Yiqun, a Rightist from Guangdong Province, going to the countryside in the name of "inspection" to collect materials for the fallacy of "the edge of starvation", but encountering obstacles everywhere and fleeing back with his tail between his legs.

　  杭州展出330幅国画新作品
    杭州市中苏友谊馆16日展出了浙江省文化局和浙江省文联联合举办的第一届全省美术展览的国画部分。
    展出的三百三十幅国画中，绝大部分是1957年的新作，反映现实生活的题材占到三分之一以上。其中有实地写生的“天台山麓”、“富春江”和反映日常生活片断的“傣人汲水”、“教妈妈认字”等。中央美术学院华东分院彩墨系助教周昌谷画的“阿妞像”，是在国画的基础上，吸收了西洋绘画艺术的优点，来刻画现代人物的一种别具风格的表现方法。
    最使参观者感到兴趣的是一幅九岁儿童郑尚树画的“蟹”。这个年仅九岁的儿童，已经初步掌握了中国画的技法，抓住了蟹的特征，人们说，这张画造型准确，画得也很生动。
    这个展览会上也展出了曾被江丰反党小集团降为职员的美术分院国画副教授诸乐三的“荷花”和“藤花蜜蜂”。在这两幅画中，老国画家很有神韻地把荷花和蜜蜂的特点都勾勒出来了。
    会上也展出了著名的老国画家潘天寿的“江洲夜泊图”和温州专区八十四岁老人冷叟的“雪景山水”等作品。

    “揭穿右派分子真面目”这部幻灯片，其中包括有“大合唱”、“鸣锣开道”、“精采设计”、“乌烟瘴气”、“后面鼓掌了”等片。
    “右派分子碰壁记”这部片子用连环漫画的形式描绘了广东省右派分子罗翼群以“视察”为名到乡下去为“饿死边缘”的谬论搜集材料，结果到处碰壁，狼狈万状，夹着尾巴逃回的情状。
