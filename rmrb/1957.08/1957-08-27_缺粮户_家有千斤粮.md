　　"Grain-Deficient Household" Has a Thousand Jin of Grain
　　Shi Guoxiang
　　Ren Jishan, the accountant of the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Jinluo Township, Zhongyang County, Shanxi Province, has been constantly complaining about "grain shortage" and "oil shortage" since the spring of this year. He even said, "The state treats cadres and workers favorably but doesn't care about peasants." Especially when his grandson celebrated his "full month," he repeatedly went to agricultural cooperative cadres and the government to ask for grain and oil, saying, "We'll have no grain to eat soon!"
　　In early July of this year, Ren Jishan was arrested by the government for serious embezzlement crimes. A large amount of grain was found in his home, including three hundred jin of wheat, four hundred and ninety jin of millet, six hundred and ninety jin of black beans, more than half a jar of millet, two hundred and twenty jin of miscellaneous grains, and half a jar of sesame oil. Thus, the truth about the "grain-deficient household," as he was publicly known, was revealed, shocking many people.
　　This fact tells us that in the countryside, there are indeed a small number of bad elements and some backward peasants who, dissatisfied with the unified purchase and sale of grain, spare no effort to pretend to be "grain-deficient" and "oil-deficient," deliberately creating a tense atmosphere. This incident makes us understand that we should be very cautious when examining "grain-deficient households" in rural areas; at the same time, it also slaps the faces of those right-wing elements who attempt to exploit loopholes in the unified purchase and sale system!

　　“缺粮户”家有千斤粮
    施国祥
    山西省中阳县金罗乡金星农业社会计任积善，自今年春季以来，一直喊叫“缺粮”、“缺油”；还说什么“国家优待干部、工人，不关心农民”。特别是他孙子做“满月”的时候，三番五次去找农业社干部和政府要粮、要油，说“马上就没有粮吃了！”
    今年7月初，任积善因有严重贪污罪行被政府逮捕，在他家中查出了大批粮食，计有小麦三百斤，小米四百九十斤，黑豆六百九十斤，糜子大半瓮，杂粮二百二十斤，还有麻油半瓮。这样，被大家所公认的“缺粮户”的老底子被揭开了，不少人因此大吃一惊。
    这件事实告诉我们，在农村中，的确有少数坏分子和一部分落后农民，由于对粮食统购统销不满，便不惜用各种办法伪装“缺粮”“缺油”，专门制造紧张空气。这件事使我们懂得在审查农村“缺粮户”的时候，应十分慎重；同时，也给了那些企图在统购统销方面钻空子的右派分子一记耳光！
