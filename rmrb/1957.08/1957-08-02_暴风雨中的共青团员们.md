    League Members in the Storm
    Fujian Daily Reporter
    On the morning of June 9th, 1957, students at Fuzhou Second Middle School were preparing for term exams and college entrance exams. From the teachers' forum being held on the second floor of the school building, a series of loud shouts and curses could be heard. Some were yelling: "The Party member principal must be dismissed and investigated!" "If he's not dismissed, we'll strike teaching!" "Down with the executioner, punish the murderer!" "We want to send representatives to the Municipal Political Consultative Conference to file a complaint!" The students wondered, what was happening?
    At noon, several startling big-character posters and cartoons appeared in the corridors. One drawing depicted the former Deputy Director of Education, Party member Lin Tianzhu, with the words "School Tyrant" written on his forehead, stepping on several corpses, his whole body covered in blood. Next to it, a big-character poster read: "The Second Middle School's purge of counter-revolutionaries was 'a serious violation of law and discipline, the establishment of private torture chambers, and the death of three people.'" Another drawing depicted the Party member Principal Le Chengqing with the words "Reactionary Thinking, Landlord Style" written on his forehead. There was also a "Proclamation" that read: "Upright people with conscience, stand up and expose Le Chengqing's crimes."
    Where did these cries come from? At the time, only a very few people knew that this was a counter-Communist conspiracy being carried out by Zhang Jiazhi, the school's vice-principal, the Deputy Minister of Propaganda for the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, and a rightist. But most students did not know what was going on. After seeing these inflammatory big-character posters and cartoons, the students could no longer concentrate on their studies. Everyone was talking about what was happening at the school.
    Faced with the rampant attacks of the rightists and the confusion in the masses' minds, the Party branch did not immediately express its attitude, but consciously allowed the Communist Youth League members and the masses to distinguish right from wrong for themselves.
    That day, Lin Yongnian, Chen Qiqiao, and Wang Shibing, graduating senior students and Communist Youth League members, saw the big-character posters and cartoons that insulted the Party and slandered the purge of counter-revolutionaries. They thought to themselves: Saying that three people were killed, isn't this a fabrication and slander, a distortion of the facts? In our school's purge of counter-revolutionaries, two people committed suicide. One was the counter-revolutionary Lin Xuequan who committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The other was Huang Zuqing, who was reported by his brother and relatives for taking a gun and going to sea as a bandit. Before the leadership could help clarify the situation, he chose the path of suicide. How can you say the principal killed them? Moreover, there weren't three deaths! Our school has achieved great success in this purge of counter-revolutionaries, aren't they negating all the achievements of the purge?
    They decided to separately discuss solutions with the students they considered to be upright. Everyone agreed that there were bad people causing trouble in the school. Communist Youth League members should step forward to defend the Party and socialism. In the middle of the night, everyone went back to their classes and found more than a hundred League members to discuss the matter, and decided to take action early the next morning.
    The next day, the Communist Youth League members put up the first batch of big-character posters refuting the rightists.
    As soon as the students entered the school gate, they were attracted by many righteous slogans and big-character posters. Here, the Communist Youth League members refuted the rightists' rumors and slander with facts and truth.
    A big-character poster written by Wang Shibing powerfully refuted Ge Baolong's lies. Ge Baolong said that the student Huang Zuqing, who committed suicide during the purge of counter-revolutionaries, was a "three-good" student. Wang Shibing pointed out that this was simply not true. He also pointed out that Ge Baolong's claim that Huang Zuqing "attempted suicide twice, and the school did not save him" was completely a lie. Huang Zuqing committed suicide out of fear of punishment, and was immediately given first aid by the school doctor after being discovered, and then sent to the hospital. How can you say they didn't save him? "Destroying the body and eliminating traces" is even more nonsense. After Huang Zuqing's death, the school bought him a coffin and erected a tombstone.
    The students learned the truth from the big-character posters and slogans, and their minds cleared up. Several hundred people successively wrote their names on the petition to counterattack the rightists.
    After the big-character posters and cartoons insulting the Party and slandering the purge of counter-revolutionaries were posted on the 9th, the rightist Zhang Jiazhi was smug and went around to find out the students' opinions. He asked this one "what are your thoughts" and asked that one "what should be done". What the students answered him with was big-character posters filled everywhere counterattacking the rightists. Under the students' counterattack, Zhang Jiazhi panicked.
    During this period, the students also foiled another conspiracy by the rightists: In order to expand the matter to society, the rightists decided to send representatives to the ongoing Fuzhou Municipal Political Consultative Conference to "accuse" the Second Middle School's purge of counter-revolutionaries. In response to this conspiracy, the students themselves decided to send representatives to the Municipal Political Consultative Conference as well. They wanted to use the Municipal Political Consultative Conference to tell the people of the city the truth about the Second Middle School's purge of counter-revolutionaries and expose the rightists' conspiracy. The representatives sent by the rightists heard that the students were also going to send representatives and dared not go.

    暴风雨中的共青团员们
    福建日报记者
    6月9日上午，福州第二中学的学生们正在准备期考和升学考试，学校第二楼下正在举行的教师鸣放座谈会上，传出了一阵激烈的叫骂声，有人在喊：“党员校长要撤职查办”“不撤职就罢教！”“打倒刽子手，惩办凶手！”“我们要派代表到市政协会去控诉”……。学生们想，这是为什么呢？
    中午，在走廊里又出现了几张触目惊心的大字报和漫画。有一幅画画的是前教导副主任、党员林天柱，额上写着“校霸”两字，脚下踏着几具死尸，全身鲜血淋漓。旁边大字报写着：二中肃反“严重违法乱纪，私设刑堂，害死三条人命。”另一幅画的是党员校长乐澄清，额上写着“反动思想，地主作风”。还有一份“文告”，上写着：“正直的有良心的人们站出来，揭发乐澄清的罪恶。”
    这些叫嚣是那里来的呢？当时，只有极少数人知道，这是该校副校长、民盟福州市委宣传部副部长、右派分子张家址在进行反共阴谋活动。但多数学生却不知是怎么回事。学生们看了这些煽动性的大字报、漫画后，再不能安心自修了。大家都在谈论着学校里发生的事情。
    面对着右派分子的猖狂进攻和群众的思想混乱情况，党支部没有马上表示态度，而有意识地让共青团员和群众自己去明辨是非。
    这天，高三毕业班学生、共青团员林永年、陈其樵、王世秉三人看了辱骂党、污蔑肃反的大字报和漫画，心中都暗暗在想：说害死三条人命，这不是造谣污蔑、歪曲事实吗？我们校内肃反两个人自杀，一个是反革命分子林学泉畏罪自杀，一个是黄祖菁被他哥哥和亲戚检举带枪下海为匪，没等领导上帮助搞清问题，就走上自杀的道路，怎能说校长害死的呢？更没有三条人命！我们学校在这次肃反中成绩是很大的，他们这样不是把肃反成绩都否定了吗？
    他们就决定分头去同自己认为是正直的同学商讨办法。大家的看法都一致：认为学校中有坏人在搞鬼。共青团员应该挺身而出，保卫党、保卫社会主义。半夜里，大家又回到各班去找了一百多个团员来讨论这件事，结果决定第二天一早就行动起来。
    第二天，共青团员们贴出了第一批驳斥右派分子的大字报。
    学生们一进校门就被许多的义正辞严的标语和大字报吸引住了。在这里，共青团员们用事实和真理驳斥了右派分子的造谣诬蔑。
    王世秉写的一张大字报，有力地驳斥了葛保龙的谎话。葛保龙说在肃反中自杀的学生黄祖菁是“三好”学生，王世秉指出这根本不是事实。他又指出葛保龙所谓黄祖菁“两次自杀，校方见死不救”完全是撒谎。黄祖菁畏罪自杀，被发现后马上由校医急救，又送医院，怎能说见死不救呢？“沉尸灭迹”更是胡说。黄祖菁死后，学校曾替他购买棺木、立有墓碑。
    学生们从大字报和标语中了解了事实的真象，头脑清醒过来了，先后有几百人在反击右派的签名书上写下了自己的名字。
    9日中午，右派分子辱骂党，污蔑肃反的大字报、漫画贴出后，右派分子张家址洋洋得意，到处探听学生们的口气。问这个“有什么感想”，问那个“应该如何办”。学生们回答他的是到处贴满了反击右派的大字报。在学生们的反击下，张家址慌了。
    在这期间，学生们还粉碎了右派分子另一个阴谋：右派分子为了把事情扩大到社会上去，决定派代表到正在举行的福州市政协会议上去“控诉”二中的肃反。针对这一阴谋，学生们自己也决定派代表到市政协去，他们要通过市政协会向全市人民讲明二中肃反的真相，揭露右派分子的阴谋。右派分子派的代表听说学生们也要派代表去，而不敢前去了。
