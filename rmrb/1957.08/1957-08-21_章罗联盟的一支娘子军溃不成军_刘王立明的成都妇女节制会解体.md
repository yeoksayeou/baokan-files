Chengdu, August 20th (Dispatch from our newspaper) Under the resolute counterattack from women circles in Chengdu, the so-called "Chengdu Branch of the China Women's Temperance Society," an outer organization of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's Sichuan branch, has collapsed. On August 19th, deceived women held a meeting and unanimously passed a resolution: to dissolve the Chengdu Temperance Branch. The Chengdu Women's Federation, based on the demands of the masses, convened an executive committee meeting and decided to revoke the group's membership in the Women's Federation.

Rightist Liu Wang Liming, in order to expand her reactionary forces, came to Chengdu at the end of last November under the guise of inspection. She avoided the party and government leading organs and secretly colluded with Luo Yaqing, the former administrative commissioner of the puppet Sichuan Provincial Police Bureau, and Yue Baoqi, a committee member of the Women's Movement Committee of the Kuomintang Sichuan Provincial Party Department and a former National Congress representative, to secretly deceive and lure women to join the Temperance Society. They boasted that the Temperance Society was an international organization, and that joining the society would not only allow them to attend meetings in Beijing and find work, but also provide opportunities to go abroad and connect with capitalist countries. In developing the organization, they emphasized that anyone could be a development target as long as they were not current criminals. After a series of activities, and without legally registering with the government, they illegally established the Chengdu Temperance Branch on December 9th. Of the nineteen directors on the board, sixteen were backbone members of reactionary parties and groups, family members of counter-revolutionaries, and released prisoners from labor camps.

Based on this situation, the Municipal Women's Federation warned them to temporarily stop developing members. However, Yue Baoqi, the president of the branch, and Luo Yaqing, the general secretary, refused the instructions of the Women's Federation and continued to develop members maliciously. Among the existing two hundred and eighteen members, 40% were released criminals, those whose control had been revoked, family members of counter-revolutionaries, and prostitutes. The remaining majority were deceived into joining. During this conspiratorial activity, Liu Wang Liming was also supported by Pan Dakui, the head of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's Sichuan branch. Liu Wang Liming specifically introduced Yue Baoqi and Luo Yaqing to Pan Dakui, asking Pan to help them more, so that they could form a black line and become a "women's detachment" for Pan to attack the Party. After Liu Wang Liming's conspiracy was exposed, deceived members successively requested to withdraw from the society. Before the dissolution, one hundred and eighty-six people had already gone through the withdrawal procedures.

　　章罗联盟的一支娘子军溃不成军
　  刘王立明的成都妇女节制会解体
    本报成都20日电　在成都妇女界的坚决反击下，章罗联盟四川分店的外围组织所谓“中华妇女节制会成都分会”土崩瓦解了。8月19日，受骗妇女举行集会，一致通过决议：解散成都节制分会，成都市妇联并根据群众要求召开执委会决定撤销该会妇联团体会员资格。
    右派分子刘王立明为了扩展反动势力，去年11月底以视察名义来成都时，避开党政领导机关，私自串通原伪四川省警察局行政专员罗雅卿、伪国大代表国民党四川省党部妇女运动委员会委员岳宝琪等偷偷摸摸欺骗拉拢妇女参加节制会。她们吹嘘说节制会是国际性组织，入了会不仅可到北京开会，可找到工作，而且有出国机会，能和资本主义国家联系。在发展组织中，强调只要不是现行犯什么人都是发展对象。经过一番活动，也没有依法向政府登记，就在12月9日非法成立成都节制分会。理事会中的十九个理事，有十六人是反动党团骨干、反革命家属和劳改释放犯。
    根据这种情况市妇联曾警告她们暂时不要发展会员。但该分会会长岳宝琪、总干事罗雅卿却拒绝妇联指示，继续恶性发展会员。在现有的二百一十八个会员中有40％是被释放的罪犯、撤销管制的分子、反革命家属和妓女等，其余大部分都是受骗入会的。在进行这一阴谋活动时，刘王立明并得到章罗联盟四川分店首脑潘大逵的支持。刘王立明特把岳宝琪、罗雅卿介绍给潘大逵，要潘多帮助她们，使他们之间结成一条黑线，变成潘向党进攻的一支“娘子军”。刘王立明阴谋被揭发后，被骗会员纷纷要求退会，解散前已办退会手续的有一百八十六人。
