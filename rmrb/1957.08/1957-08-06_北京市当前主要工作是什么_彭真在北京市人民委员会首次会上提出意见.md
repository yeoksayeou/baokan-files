    Xinhua News Agency, August 5th – The newly elected Beijing Municipal People's Committee held its first meeting last night. Mayor Peng Zhen, based on the resolutions and spirit of the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress, presented his opinions on several major tasks currently facing Beijing.

    Peng Zhen pointed out that at present, the struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements should continue to be deepened, and the rectification movement should continue to be deepened, as this is the key to ensuring the smooth progress of socialist undertakings. He proposed that administrative organs and management institutions of enterprises and institutions should be conscientiously streamlined, and 30% to 50% of the staff of organs and enterprise management personnel should be transferred to the grassroots to participate in production and work. In industry, it is necessary to conscientiously streamline management personnel, improve product quality, reduce costs, and pay close attention to the safety of workers in production. In commerce, it is necessary to achieve less waste, less expenses, and fewer management personnel, good commodity quality, good service attitude, and convenience for the masses.

    Regarding school education, Peng Zhen said that middle and primary school graduates who have not been admitted to schools, and who are of suitable age and physical condition for labor, can participate in labor for training and learning. For middle and primary school graduates who have neither been admitted to school nor can participate in labor, parents should be mobilized to find ways to pool their efforts, without increasing state expenditure, so that students can continue to learn. He pointed out that the competent authorities should lead this work well, and the government and parents have a responsibility to prevent a single middle or primary school graduate from wandering and becoming uneducated. Peng Zhen also said that now is the season when infectious diseases are prone to spread, and the competent departments should step up the patriotic health campaign and do a good job in prevention.

    The meeting unanimously agreed with the above-mentioned work guidelines and opinions, and instructed the competent departments to submit specific plans separately for discussion by the Municipal People's Committee.

    北京市当前主要工作是什么
    彭真在北京市人民委员会首次会上提出意见
    新华社5日讯　昨天新选出的北京市人民委员会当晚召开了第一次会议。彭真市长根据北京市第二届人民代表大会第二次会议的决议和精神，提出了北京市当前几项主要工作的意见。
    彭真指出，目前应当继续深入开展反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争，继续深入开展整风运动，这是保证社会主义事业顺利进行的关键。他提出，要认真精简行政机关和企业事业的管理机构，抽调30％到50％的机关工作人员和企业管理人员到基层去参加生产和工作。在工业方面，要认真精简管理人员，提高产品质量，降低成本，并且切实注意工人的生产安全。在商业方面，要做到损耗少、费用少、管理人员少，商品质量好、服务态度好和便利群众。
    关于学校教育工作方面，彭真说，凡是没有考取学校的中、小学毕业生，年龄和体力适宜参加劳动，可以在劳动中锻炼和学习。对于既没有考上学校、又不能参加劳动的中、小学毕业生，应该动员学生家长想办法，以便群策群力，不增加国家开支，使学生能够继续学习。他指出主管机关要很好地领导这项工作，政府和家长都有责任不使一个中、小学毕业生游荡失教。彭真还说，现在正是传染病容易流行的时节，主管部门要抓紧爱国卫生运动和做好预防工作。
    会议一致同意以上的工作方针和意见，并且责成各主管部门分别提出具体方案，提交市人民委员会讨论。
