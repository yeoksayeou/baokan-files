　　Announcement of the Independence of Malaya
　　Lin Ming
    Today, the Federation of Malaya announces its independence, and all those who care about the international anti-colonialist movement cannot but express congratulations and gratification at this event.
    Malaya is a country in Southeast Asia with abundant resources and beautiful scenery. It is located in the central and southern part of the Malay Peninsula. It is adjacent to Thailand in the northeast, faces the South China Sea in the southeast, and faces Sumatra, Indonesia across the Strait of Malacca in the southwest. At its southern tip is Singapore, one of the largest commercial and naval ports in the East. The capital of Malaya is Kuala Lumpur. Malaya has a land area of 131,794 square kilometers, three-quarters of which is undeveloped forest land. Malaya is world-renowned for its production of rubber and tin ore, with an average annual output of more than 600,000 tons of rubber and more than 60,000 tons of tin, accounting for 33% and 35% of the world's total output, respectively.
    Malaya has a population of more than 6.2 million. It is a multi-ethnic country. Malays, Chinese, and Indians are the three main ethnic groups. Although each ethnic group maintains its inherent religion, language, and culture, they have always lived in harmony.
    Malaya began to gradually become a foreign colony more than 400 years ago. As early as the beginning of the 16th century, Portugal invaded Malacca on the west coast of Malaya. By the mid-17th century, the Netherlands seized this place from the Portuguese. In 1824, the Netherlands was squeezed out of Malacca by British colonists. At this time, the British colonists combined the three trading ports of Penang, Malacca, and Singapore on the west coast of Malaya into the Straits Settlements directly under the British King, and then used the Straits Settlements as a base to invade the interior of Malaya. From 1874 to 1914, Britain successively forced the nine states of Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Kelantan, Terengganu, Kedah, Perlis, and Johor in Malaya to accept its "protection," and combined the first four states into the "Malay Federation," and the latter five states were called the "Malay Unfederated States." Therefore, before World War II, Malaya was divided by Britain into three parts: the Straits Settlements, the Malay Federation, and the Malay Unfederated States.
    For more than a hundred years, British colonists have used the labor of local ethnic groups and foreign immigrants in Malaya to develop and plunder Malaya's rich economic resources, turning Malaya into a raw material production base and industrial product sales market for British monopoly capital. British capital controls the economic lifeline of Malaya—the production of rubber and tin. British investment in this area is estimated to be more than 100 million pounds. The production of rubber and tin not only brings high profits to British monopoly capitalists, but also brings huge amounts of US dollars to the British Empire. Britain earns more than 200 million US dollars in foreign exchange each year from the sale of rubber and tin, thereby increasing its dollar reserves and balancing its dollar deficit. It can be seen that Malaya has great economic value to the British Empire. At the same time, Malaya's strategic position is also very important. Singapore, at its southern tip, controls the Strait of Malacca, which connects the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and is the largest British naval base in the Far East. Precisely because of these reasons, British colonialists have always tried every means to maintain their colonial rule in Malaya.
  However, like the people of other Asian and African countries, the people of Malaya are unwilling to succumb to colonialist enslavement and exploitation. In order to oppose the colonial system and fight for national liberation, the people of Malaya have carried out long-term and unremitting struggles. After the establishment of the Malayan Communist Party in 1931, the liberation struggle of the Malayan people had an organized and leading force. At the end of 1941, the Japanese army invaded Malaya, and the British army was defeated. In order to liberate their motherland and assist the Allied countries at that time, the Malayan Communist Party, regardless of all difficulties and sacrifices, held high the banner of resistance against Japan and led the masses of people to carry out a heroic struggle against the Japanese aggressors. During the more than three years of the Anti-Japanese War, the blood of the Malayan people and their anti-Japanese army was spilled all over Malaya, and they gave the Japanese aggressors a powerful blow. Therefore, at the end of the war, the prestige of the Malayan Communist Party was very high. It not only had its own armed forces, but also partially established a people's government.
    After Japan surrendered, the people of Malaya eagerly hoped that an independent Malaya would be born from then on, but this hope was dashed. The British colonial authorities came to enslave the people of Malaya again. Regardless of the Malayan people's desire for independence, freedom, and democracy, the British authorities brazenly disbanded the People's Anti-Japanese Army and the people's government, and restored their old colonial rule. At the same time, in order to strengthen its rule, Britain made a new division of Malaya's administrative regions, making Singapore a separate directly-governed colony, directly ruled by the Governor, and the remaining areas were merged into the Federation of Malaya, with the British High Commissioner as its administrative head. People from all walks of life in Malaya universally opposed these measures of the British, so Britain took a series of repressive measures against the people of Malaya. In order to completely eliminate the revolutionary forces in Malaya, Britain promulgated the "Emergency Regulations" in June 1948, aimed at depriving the people of all basic rights and freedoms, and launched a full-scale colonial war, attempting to strangle the Malayan national liberation movement in one to three months. Under such circumstances, the Malayan Communist Party had to take up arms again to fight for the independence and freedom of Malaya.
    In the past few years, the Malayan Communist Party has repeatedly proposed ending the war through negotiations, and held negotiations with the Malayan authorities in Hualing, northern Malaya, in December 1955, but this negotiation failed to reach an agreement due to the obstruction of the British colonialists. As late as March of this year, the MCP repeatedly suggested resuming peace talks, but was rejected.
    More than nine years of colonial war has caused the people of Malaya to suffer heavy war disasters, and the British people have also paid huge war expenses and shed many innocent lives for this. However, the British colonial authorities' attempt to use war to extinguish the Malayan people's desire for independence has not achieved its goal; on the contrary, the Malayan people's independence movement has expanded further, and the people's call for ending the "state of emergency" has become louder and louder. Under this situation, the British authorities had to change their strategy, that is, on the one hand, continue to implement a policy of military suppression, and on the other hand, make certain political concessions to Malaya under the banner of "helping Malaya gradually achieve autonomy." This is first manifested in the "New Constitution" promulgated in 1954. This "New Constitution" allows Malaya to establish a partially elected parliament (52 of the 98 members are elected, and the rest are appointed by the British) and a government. However, important departments of the government such as political affairs, judiciary, finance, economy and defense continue to be controlled by the British, and the British High Commissioner is still the head of the government. The power shared by the elected ministers is extremely limited, so this modification of the political system has not changed the essence of British colonial rule.
    In July 1955, Malaya held its first general election based on the "New Constitution." The parties participating in the election included the MCA-MIC alliance (i.e., the alliance of the United Malays National Organization, the Malayan Chinese Association, the Malayan Indian Congress), the Malayan Labour Party, the National Party, the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party, and other parties. All parties took "striving for independent autonomy" and "abolishing emergency regulations" as the main program of their campaigns. As a result of the election, the MCA-MIC alliance won 51 of the 52 elected seats, and Abdul Rahman, the leader of the alliance, formed a government and became the Chief Minister himself.
    The "autonomy" trick played by the British authorities certainly cannot deceive the Malayan people. They demand real independence and freedom. After the Asian-African Conference, the Malayan people's desire for independence and freedom became even stronger, which forced the MCA-MIC alliance government to change the independence goal originally stipulated in its platform from four years to two years.
    In January 1956, the British government and the Malayan government held negotiations in London on the issue of Malayan independence and reached an agreement. Britain agreed that Malaya would declare its independence within the Commonwealth on August 31, 1957. However, the agreement stipulates that Britain will continue to station troops in independent Malaya through the signing of a mutual defense treaty with Malaya, use military bases, and carry out "communist suppression" operations. Britain will also provide financial assistance to Malaya for "communist suppression" and military construction.
    After the London negotiations, the work of formulating the new Malayan constitution and the mutual defense treaty began. Now the new constitution has been officially promulgated, and the mutual defense treaty has also been drafted and will be signed in the short term. Britain has also decided to assist Malaya with more than 37 million pounds in the five years starting this year as expenses for "communist suppression" and military construction.
    According to the new constitution, Malaya will have one supreme head of state and one deputy, who will be elected by the sultans of the nine states for a term of five years. They have the power to appoint the Prime Minister of the cabinet and to extend or dissolve the parliament. The parliament is bicameral. The upper house has 38 members, of which 22 are elected by the parliaments of the eleven states (i.e., the original nine states of Malaya plus the newly established autonomous states of Penang and Malacca), and 16 are recommended by the Supreme Head of State. The lower house has 100 members, all of whom are elected through universal suffrage. However, because it is necessary to first process new citizen registration and compile voter lists, the first general election after independence must be held after January 1959. Before the general election, the old parliament will continue to exercise its functions as usual, and the government will only be partially reorganized. The Sultan of Negeri Sembilan, Abdul Rahman, and the Sultan of Selangor, Hishamuddin Alam Shah, have been elected as the Supreme Head of State and Deputy Supreme Head of State of Malaya, respectively. The original Chief Minister Abdul Rahman (who shares the same name as the Supreme Head of State) serves as the Prime Minister after independence. In addition, the new constitution stipulates that Malay is the national language, but English will continue to be used as an official language in the next ten years; Islam is the state religion, but this does not affect Malaya's status as a non-religious country.
    With the announcement of independence, the people of Malaya have entered a new historical stage. The people of Malaya know that their independence is not yet complete. The political and economic tasks facing the people of Malaya are arduous and complex. Only by strengthening unity, close cooperation among all ethnic groups, classes, and parties in Malaya can the cause of Malayan independence and construction be consolidated and developed.

　　宣布独立的马来亚
　　林明
    今天，马来亚联合邦宣布独立了，凡是关心国际反殖民主义运动的人们都不能不对这件事表示祝贺和欣慰。
    马来亚是东南亚地区物产富饶、风光明媚的国家。它位于马来半岛的中部和南部。东北部与泰国毗邻，东南面临南中国海，西南隔马六甲海峡和印度尼西亚的苏门答腊岛对峙。在它南端有东方最大的商港和军港之一——新加坡。马来亚首都设在吉隆坡。马来亚有十三万一千七百九十四平方公里的土地面积，其中四分之三是尚未开发的森林地带。马来亚以盛产橡胶和锡砂著名于世，橡胶平均年产量六十余万吨，锡六万余吨，各占世界总产量的33％和35％。
    马来亚有六百二十多万人口。它是一个多民族的国家。马来人、华人和印度人是三个主要的民族。各民族虽都保持着固有的宗教、语言和文化，但是他们一直是和睦无间地相处着。
    马来亚是在四百多年前开始逐步沦为外国殖民地的。早在十六世纪初叶，葡萄牙就侵入马来亚西海岸的马六甲。到十七世纪中叶，荷兰从葡萄牙人手里夺取了这个地方。1824年荷兰受到英国殖民者的排挤才退出马六甲。这时，英国殖民者把马来亚西海岸的三个通商港口槟榔屿、马六甲和新加坡合成为英王直辖的海峡殖民地，然后以海峡殖民地为据点向马来亚内陆侵犯。从1874年到1914年，英国先后迫使霹雳、雪兰峨、森美兰、彭亨、吉兰丹、丁加奴、吉打、玻璃市、柔佛等马来亚的九个土邦接受其“保护”，并将前四邦合成为“马来联邦”，后五邦称为“马来属邦”。因此，在第二次世界大战以前，马来亚被英国分裂为海峡殖民地、马来联邦和马来属邦三个部分。
    一百多年来，英国殖民者利用马来亚当地民族和外来移民的劳力从事开发和掠夺马来亚丰富的经济资源，把马来亚变为英国垄断资本的原料产地和工业品销售市场。英国资本控制了马来亚的经济命脉——橡胶和锡的生产。英国在这方面的投资估计有一亿多英镑。橡胶和锡的生产不仅给英国垄断资本家带来高额的利润，而且给大英帝国换来了巨额的美元。英国每年从胶、锡的销售中获得二亿以上美元的外汇，借以增加自己的美元储备和平衡自己的美元逆差。可以看出，马来亚对大英帝国具有重大的经济价值。同时，马来亚的战略地位也很重要。在它南端的新加坡控制着连接印度洋和太平洋的马六甲海峡，是英国在远东最大的海军基地。正由于这些原因，英殖民主义者总是千方百计地要维持住它在马来亚的殖民统治。
  但是，和亚非各国人民一样，马来亚人民是不愿屈从于殖民主义的奴役和剥削的。为了反对殖民制度，争取民族解放，马来亚人民进行了长期不懈的斗争。1931年马来亚共产党成立后，马来亚人民的解放斗争便有了组织和领导力量。1941年底，日军侵入马来亚，英军被击败，马来亚共产党为了解放祖国和协助当时的同盟国，不顾一切困难和牺牲，高举抗日旗帜，领导人民群众对日本侵略者进行了英勇的斗争。在三年多的抗日战争中，马来亚人民及其抗日军的鲜血洒遍了马来亚各地，他们给了日本侵略者以有力的打击。因此，在战争结束时，马来亚共产党的威信很高，它不仅有了自己的武装，而且还部分地建立了人民的政权。
    日本投降后，马来亚人民都热望一个独立的马来亚会从此诞生，但这个希望却落空了。英国殖民当局重新来奴役马来亚人民了。不顾马来亚人民要求独立自由民主的愿望，英国当局悍然解散人民抗日军和人民政权，恢复其旧日的殖民统治。同时，为了加强统治，英国对马来亚的行政区域作了新的划分，将新加坡作为单独的直辖殖民地，由总督直接统治，其余地区合并为马来亚联合邦，以英高级专员为其行政首脑。马来亚各阶层人民普遍反对英国的这些措施，于是英国对马来亚人民采取了一连串的镇压措施。为了彻底消灭马来亚的革命力量，英国在1948年6月颁布了旨在剥夺人民一切基本权利和自由的“紧急条例”并发动了全面的殖民战争，妄图在一至三个月内一举扼杀马来亚民族解放运动。在这种情况下，马来亚共产党不得不重新拿起武器，为争取马来亚的独立和自由而斗争。
    几年来，马来亚共产党曾一再提出以谈判方式结束战争的建议，并曾于1955年12月在马来亚北部的华玲和马来亚当局举行谈判，但这个谈判由于英国殖民者的阻挠没有能够达成协议。一直到今年3月间，马共还一再建议恢复和平谈判，但都遭到拒绝。
    九年多的殖民战争使马来亚人民遭受惨重的战祸，英国人民为此也支付了巨额的战费和无谓地流了许多鲜血，但是英国殖民当局想用战争来扑灭马来亚人民的独立愿望并没有达到目的；相反地，马来亚人民的独立运动更加扩展了，人民要求结束“紧急状态”的呼声越来越高了。在这种形势下，英国当局不得不改变策略，即一方面继续执行军事镇压政策，另一方面则打着“帮助马来亚逐步实现自治”的旗帜来对马来亚作某些政治上的让步。这首先表现在1954年颁布的“新宪制”上。这个“新宪制”允许马来亚设立部分民选的议会（九十八名议员中民选五十二名，其余由英方指定）和政府。但是，政府的政务、司法、财政、经济和防务等重要部门则继续由英国人掌握，英高级专员仍然是政府的首脑，民选部长所分享的权力极为有限，所以这种政治制度的修改并没有改变英国殖民统治的实质。
    1955年7月，马来亚根据“新宪制”举行第一次大选。参加竞选的有马华印联盟（即马来民族联合组织、马华公会和马来亚印度国大党三个政党的联盟）、马来亚劳工党、国家党、泛马伊斯兰教党等党派。各政党都以“争取独立自治”、“取消紧急条例”为竞选的主要纲领。选举结果，马华印联盟获得五十二个民选议席中的五十一席，由该盟领袖阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼出组政府并自任首席部长。
    英国当局所耍的“自治”把戏当然欺骗不了马来亚人民，他们要求真正的独立自由。在亚非会议以后，马来亚人民要求独立自由的愿望更为高涨，这就迫使马华印联盟政府不得不把它原来政纲中所规定的独立目标由四年改为二年内实现。
    1956年1月，英国政府和马来亚政府在伦敦就马来亚独立问题举行谈判，达成了协议。英国同意马来亚在1957年8月31日在英联邦范围内宣布独立。但协议规定英国将通过同马来亚签订一项防御互助条约在独立后的马来亚继续驻军、使用军事基地并执行“剿共”的作战任务。英国还将向马来亚提供用于“剿共”和建军的财政援助。
    伦敦谈判结束后，制定马来亚新宪法和防御互助条约的工作开始进行。现在新宪法正式颁布了，防御互助条约也草拟好了，短期内就要签字。英国并已决定要在自今年起的五年内援助马来亚三千七百多万英镑作为“剿共”、建军等费用。
    根据新宪法，马来亚设正副最高元首各一人，由九个州苏丹互选产生，每届任期五年，他们拥有任命内阁总理以及延长或解散议会的权力。国会为两院制，上议院有议员三十八人，其中二十二人由十一个州（即原马来亚的九个州加上新成立的槟榔屿和马六甲两个自治州）的议会选出，十六人由最高元首推荐。下议院有议员一百人，均通过普选产生。但是，由于需要先行办理新公民登记和编造选民名册，独立后的第一届大选须在1959年1月以后才能举行，在大选前，旧议会将照常行使职权而政府只作部分改组。现已选出森美兰州苏丹阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼和雪兰峨州的苏丹希萨穆丁·阿拉姆·沙阿分别担任马来亚的正副最高元首。原首席部长阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼（和最高元首同名）担任独立后的总理。此外，新宪法规定马来语为国语，但在今后的十年内英语将继续被采用为官方语言；伊斯兰教为国教，但这并不影响马来亚作为非宗教国的地位。
    随着独立的宣布，马来亚人民进入了一个新的历史阶段。马来亚人民知道他们的独立还不完全，摆在马来亚人民面前的政治和经济任务是艰巨而复杂的，只有马来亚各民族各阶层和各党派加强团结，紧密合作，马来亚的独立和建设事业才能获得巩固和发展。（附图片）
