    The Elderly Man on the Mobile Phone Vehicle
    Su Zhongchao
    When the train passed Tianjin Station, I couldn't help but think of the temporary mobile phone vehicle there, and the elderly man working on it.
    It was back in June of last year. I was going to Beijing for something, and I originally wanted to get off the train in Tianjin to see my younger brother whom I hadn't seen in many years. However, time did not allow me to wait too long, so I had to contact him by phone first. I found the temporary mobile phone vehicle on the second platform. I remembered the phone number from a few years ago, but no matter how I dialed, the call wouldn't go through. I searched through the phone book and even called the public security bureau and police station in a certain district, but I couldn't find it. I heard that the name of this organization was confidential, and of course, the phone number was also confidential. What to do! Many passengers were also worried for me. It just so happened that the elderly man on the mobile phone vehicle gave me an idea. He used the phone to find another organization for me, and asked someone from that organization to notify my younger brother. We finally got through and took care of the matter.
    The second time was this year during the Spring Festival. I was passing through Tianjin again on business and wanted to make a phone call to ask my younger brother to come home for the Spring Festival. Unfortunately, the train arrived in Tianjin at three o'clock in the morning, when people were sound asleep. I tried to call several times, but couldn't get through. The train only stopped for fifteen minutes, and I couldn't get through on the phone. Just when I was at a loss, the elderly man on the temporary mobile phone vehicle said, "If it's not some kind of military secret, why don't you write what you want to say on a piece of paper. When the office opens at eight o'clock, I'll give them a call for you, wouldn't that be easier!" Yes! I happily wrote a note and gave it to the elderly man, thanking him. During the Spring Festival, my younger brother indeed came home on time. Thinking of this, how grateful I am to Tianjin Station and this elderly man! He is a model of serving the people. At the same time, I also recalled what things were like before liberation. Once, I went to Tianjin to look for an uncle. Because I didn't know his address, I spent three days in a phone booth before I could find him. And now, the station has a temporary mobile phone vehicle, and it only takes ten minutes to find the person you're looking for. (Attached picture)

    流动电话车上的老人
    苏中朝
    当火车路过天津车站的时候，不禁使我想起了这里的临时流动电话车，想到在车上工作的老人。
    那还是去年6月份的事情。我因事到北京，本想路过天津的时候，下车去看一看我多年没有见面的弟弟。但是时间又不允许我等待过久，只好先用电话和他联系。我在第二站台找到了临时流动电话车。我记的电话号码是几年前的，电话怎么打也打不通。我查遍了电话号码本、又打给某区公安局、派出所也没有查着。听说这个机关名称保密，电话号码当然也保密了。怎么办呢！许多旅客也在为我着急。恰巧这时候流动电话车上的老人给我出了主意，他用电话替我找到了另外一个机关，让那个机关的人再去通知我弟弟。我们终于通了话，也办了要办的事。
    第二次是今年春节，我又因事路过天津，想打个电话约我弟弟回家过春节。不巧，列车到天津是早晨三点多钟，人们正睡在甜蜜的梦乡。我打了几次电话都没有打通。火车只停留十五分钟，电话又打不通，正没办法的时候，临时流动电话车上的老人说：“你如果不是什么军事秘密，你就把你要说的话写在纸条上，等八点钟机关上了班我给你打电话，不就省事了吗！”是啊！我高兴得写了个纸条交给了老人，并谢谢他。春节期间，我弟弟果然按时回了家。想到这，我多么感激天津车站和这位老人啊！他才是为人民服务的典范呢。同时我也想起了解放前的事。有一次我到天津找一个叔父。因为不知道他的地址，在电话亭里花了三天的时间才查到。而现在，车站有了临时流动电话车，只要十几分钟就可以找到你所要找的人。（附图片）
