Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 11th: The rural areas of Tianjin Special District are currently carrying out publicity on grain issues. Work teams in various counties have discovered serious phenomena of concealment of production and waste of grain in some agricultural cooperatives. This situation has begun to improve after education by the work teams.

The counties have all found that some agricultural cooperatives were very careless during the summer harvest, even deliberately leaving ears of grain unharvested. In Liu Shiyin Village Agricultural Cooperative in Qing County, the original planned wheat yield was more than 243,000 jin, but after harvesting, the cooperative only reported a yield of more than 200,900 jin, a loss of more than 30,000 jin. After inspection by the work team, it was found that the tops and sides of thirty-four wheat straw stacks in the threshing ground were sealed with mud. A random pull of a handful of wheat straw revealed 267 grains of wheat. The work team estimates that these wheat stacks could yield at least another 20,000 jin of wheat.

Ba County also discovered that more than 100 agricultural cooperatives were encouraging members to work in the fields by providing meals. This method wasted a lot of grain and also used wheat seeds and production costs. Two cooperatives alone consumed more than 27,000 jin of wheat and peas. Cadres of the Wangzhuangzi Agricultural Cooperative in Baodi County believed that everyone had worked hard for half a year and planned to treat the members to a big feast, using 300 jin of wheat from the cooperative to grind into flour, and also bought a pig, 15 jin of wine, and 10 jin of vermicelli, etc. Later, after being stopped by township cadres, these items were sold to the members.

Now, some wasteful phenomena have been stopped, and some cooperatives that concealed production have reported their actual yields after education. For example, the original assessed wheat yield of the Dongxinzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Wuqing County was 168,000 jin, but before the publicity campaign, they reported a loss of 39,000 jin. After the publicity, the members revealed that the actual increase in production was 9,000 jin.

    天津专区宣传节约粮食
    制止瞒产和浪费现象
    据新华社保定11日电　天津专区各县农村正展开粮食问题的宣传。各县的工作组都发现，部分农业社有严重的瞒产和浪费粮食的现象。经过工作组的教育，这个情况已开始好转。
    各县都发现：夏收中有些农业社收割非常粗糙，甚至故意漏割掉穗。青县刘士殷屯农业社，小麦原定产二十四万三千多斤，收割后社里只报产二十万零九千多斤，亏产三万多斤。经工作组检查，发现打麦场里三十四个麦秸垛，顶上和四周都用泥土密封着，随便拉出一把麦秸检查，就发现有二百六十七个麦粒。据工作组估计，这些麦垛至少还可以再打出两万斤小麦。
    霸县还发现有一百多个农业社用管社员吃饭的办法，鼓励社员下地劳动。这种办法浪费了不少粮食，而且动用了小麦种籽和生产费，仅两个社就吃掉小麦和豌豆两万七千多斤。宝坻县王庄子农业社干部认为大家辛劳了半年，准备请社员大吃大喝一顿，用社里的小麦磨了三百斤面，还买了一只猪、十五斤酒和十斤粉条等。后来经乡干部制止，把这些东西卖给了社员。
    现在，有些浪费现象被制止了，有些瞒产的社经教育后，纷纷实报产量。如武清县东辛庄农业社原评定的小麦产量是十六万八千斤，宣传前报亏产了三万九千斤。宣传后社员们才说出实际增产了九千斤。
