    Testifying to Luo Longji's Reactionary Words and Deeds
    Pu Xixiu Exposes Some Major Facts
    (Our Dispatch) At the seventh enlarged rectification forum of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League held on the 12th, Pu Xixiu exposed some major facts about Luo Longji's reactionary activities.
    In her speech, Pu Xixiu proved that Lu Guangguang's previous exposure of Luo Longji's conspiracy to coerce and frame the late Chairman Zhang Lan was completely true. She further exposed Luo Longji's anti-communist conspiracy during his convalescence at the Hongqiao Sanatorium in Shanghai.
    Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji's intention in holding Chairman Zhang Lan back from going to the Liberated Areas was to increase his own political capital to repay his American masters. The "slanderous remarks against Chairman Mao" made by Chairman Zhang Lan to foreign reporters were entirely a major deception planned by Luo Longji. Those words that slandered Chairman Mao were actually said by Luo Longji.

    Conspiring to Oppose the Party Under the Guise of Opposing Chiang; Colluding with Major and Minor Secret Agents
    Luo Longji's admission to the Hongqiao Sanatorium in Shanghai for convalescence was guaranteed by Zhang Lisheng, the Kuomintang secret service chief, at the behest of Stuart. Therefore, Luo Longji said in a letter to me that his safety was absolutely assured. He could go out freely in Shanghai, find friends, stroll on the streets, and plot anti-communist conspiracies under the guise of opposing Chiang. At that time, Ye Duyi was in Shanghai as his liaison with the American imperialist side, and Han Ming was connecting with foreign reporters to promote Luo Longji. Luo Longji himself also colluded with some major and minor Kuomintang secret agents. He had constant correspondence with the Nanjing Chiang clique secret agents. Kuomintang secret agents Lei Zhen, He Haoruo, Liu Qi, etc. also often visited him. Liu Qi even wanted to give him a villa in Lushan for his convalescence. He also had close dealings with the wife of the traitor secret agent Zhou Fohai, as well as Zhou Fohai's son and daughter-in-law. All these are conclusive evidence that Luo Longji cannot deny. Luo Longji should thoroughly confess these relationships.

    At that time, Luo Longji's anti-communist conspiracy used Li Zongren as a pawn. When the People's Liberation Army was about to cross the Yangtze River, he wrote to me saying: "I have always been optimistic about the Beiping peace talks." Later, when Li Zongren did not accept the peace talks, Luo Longji said with emotion: "The CCP's eight articles and twenty-four clauses are too harsh in wording, making it difficult for Li Zongren to save face, thus causing the breakdown of the peace talks." Even after the People's Liberation Army had crossed the Yangtze River, Luo Longji was still lamenting for the reactionary ruling class. He himself said that he supported the Communist Party, but in reality, he was speaking from the standpoint of the reactionary ruling class, engaging in anti-communist and anti-people conspiracies. Even more viciously, on the eve of Shanghai's liberation, Luo still wanted to drag Chairman Zhang Lan to the American consulate. He said in a letter to me, "The American consulate in Kunming took in six professors back then, so why can't the current American consulate in Shanghai take in me and Zhang Lan?" Later, the underground party also rescued him in order to rescue Chairman Zhang Lan. However, he never forgot the kindness of the secret agents, became sworn brothers with secret agents, and wanted to introduce the secret agent Yan Jinwen into the league as a benefactor.

    Ye Duyi is a Liaison Officer of the Zhang-Luo Alliance
    Pu Xixiu also said: In order to expose the Zhang-Luo alliance, I must expose that Ye Duyi is a liaison officer of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

    Before the Second National Congress of the China Democratic League last year, in early 1955 or 1956, Ye Duyi came to see me. Ye Duyi said, "Zhang Bojun wants to help Luo Longji make progress and wants to give his thinking a bit of a shake-up within the League. Do you agree?" I said, "It won't work if Zhang Bojun does it. You should first ask the United Front Work Department for instructions." Ye Duyi never came to my house before. Why did he suddenly come to my house now? Ye Duyi also told me in a panic before leaving, "You must never tell anyone about this matter." What is so secretive about this? This is the beginning of Ye Duyi's connection between Zhang and Luo. Later, Luo Longji indeed expressed that his strength was only a quarter of that of Zhang Bojun. From then on, he not only stopped scolding Zhang Bojun, but also expressed his willingness to cooperate with Zhang Bojun at the Second National Congress of the China Democratic League.

    After the Zhang Dongsun incident was exposed, Ye Duyi was relatively estranged from Luo Longji for a period of time. However, after the Zhang-Luo cooperation, Ye Duyi often ran errands for Luo Longji. Once, I ran into Ye at Luo's place. Ye said to Luo, "Now I can go to your house openly and boldly without worrying about people saying that I am engaged in sectarianism with you." This means that the Zhang-Luo alliance has already been brewing and is mature, and Ye Duyi is acting as the liaison officer of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Later, Luo Longji nominated Ye Duyi as the Deputy Secretary-General of the CPPCC, asking Ye Duyi to work harder for the Zhang-Luo alliance. Last year, I spent a week in Beidaihe, and I indeed did not see Zhang Bojun coming to Luo Longji's house. Many things about the Zhang-Luo alliance were carried out through Ye Duyi, the liaison officer. At that time, Ye Duyi came to see Luo Longji the most. The more than 150 opinions put forward by Luo Longji to the China Democratic League were also conveyed to Zhang Bojun by Ye Duyi. Luo Longji wanted to plot conspiracies and make appointments with people, all of which were made by Ye Duyi.

    Ye Duyi's absurd speech at the United Front Work Department's forum about establishing an intellectual political party was also Luo Longji's opinion. Luo Longji once said to me that it is enough for the democratic parties to have the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the China Democratic League. The targets of these three democratic parties are clear. However, the targets of the China Democratic League and China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and the Jiusan Society are mixed up, all targeting intellectuals. Why not merge them together? Ye Duyi's speech was not accidental.

    Luo Longji said that he has not engaged in anti-party small group activities in the past three years, but he held secret meetings last year.
    Next, Pu Xixiu also revealed an important fact. She said: The case of Sun Dayu falsely accusing Communist Party members of being counter-revolutionaries was planned in advance by Luo Longji and agreed to by Zeng Zhaolun. During the Second National Congress of the China Democratic League last year, Luo Longji met secretly with Zeng Zhaolun, Sun Dayu, and Peng Wenyin at his home. I went to Luo Longji's house that day, and because I didn't call in advance, I ran into this secret meeting. At that time, Luo Longji was saying to Sun Dayu, I spent a whole night reading your 80,000-word report (the content of which was to falsely accuse Communist Party members of being counter-revolutionaries - Editor's note). I don't think it's appropriate to bring it up now. Luo Longji then said to Zeng Zhaolun, what do you think? Zeng Zhaolun also said, It is not appropriate to bring it up now. So Zeng said to Sun Dayu, since you are not doing well at Fudan University, I will find a way to send you to Hangzhou for a year's vacation. You can temporarily study Shakespeare in Hangzhou, still get paid, and still be a professor. Sun Dayu expressed his acceptance of Luo and Zeng's opinions at the time. During the Great Blooming and Great Contending, Sun Dayu believed that the time had come, so he actively brought up the matter of falsely accusing Communist Party members of being counter-revolutionaries at the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Work Conference, launching a frenzied attack on the Party.

    At that time, Luo Longji also said to Peng Wenyin, Your problem is different from Sun Dayu's. I suggest that you stay in Shanghai. Shen Zhiyuan in Shanghai unites with you very well. You still have a share in the deputy director of the Shanghai Democratic League. What are you doing in Beijing? At that time, Peng Wenyin wanted to be transferred to work in Beijing and wanted Luo Longji to find a way to transfer him, but Luo Longji refused to give up his stronghold in Shanghai.

    Luo Longji denied that he has had any contact with his anti-party small group in the past three years and that there is no organizational structure for the small group, only spiritual connections. This secret meeting is solid evidence that his anti-party small group still exists, and Luo Longji cannot deny it.

    Pu Xixiu finally said that Luo Longji repeatedly denied the fact that Zhou Jingwen, one of the members of his reactionary small group, had a secret talk with him before going to Hong Kong, but he told me personally: Before Zhou Jingwen went to Hong Kong, I asked him to come and talk.

    为罗隆基的反动言行作证
    浦熙修揭发一些重大事实
    本报讯　在12日举行的民盟中央第七次整风扩大座谈会上，浦熙修揭发了罗隆基反动活动的一些重大事实。
    浦熙修在发言中，证明上次吕光光揭发罗隆基胁迫、陷害故张澜主席的阴谋，完全是事实。她并进一步揭发罗隆基在上海虹桥疗养院养病期间的反共阴谋。
    浦熙修说：罗隆基挟持张澜主席不许去解放区的目的是想增加自己的政治资本来报效美国主子，张澜主席向外国记者发表的“污蔑毛主席”的谈话，完全是罗隆基策划的一个大骗局。污蔑毛主席的那些话，实际上就是罗隆基说的。
    借反蒋之名策划反党阴谋；和大大小小特务勾搭
    罗隆基到上海虹桥疗养院养病是司徒雷登要国民党特务头子张厉生来担保的。因此，罗隆基在给我的信中说过，他的安全绝无问题。他可以在上海随便外出，找朋友，逛马路，借反蒋之名策划反共阴谋。那时叶笃义在上海作为他与美帝国主义方面的串连人，韩鸣是串连外国记者来为罗隆基张目的。罗隆基自己又勾搭了一些大大小小的国民党特务，他和南京蒋记特务不断地有着信函往来，国民党特务雷震、何浩若、刘崎等也常去看他，刘崎并要送他在庐山的别墅一栋，为他养病之用。他还和汉奸特务周佛海的老婆，以及周佛海的儿子、媳妇等有密切的来往。这些都是证据确凿，罗隆基是无法狡赖的，罗隆基对于这些关系都应该彻底交代。
    罗隆基那时反共阴谋的棋子是下在李宗仁身上的。在解放大军已经快过江的时候，他还写信告诉我说：“我对于北平和谈始终抱着乐观的希望。”后来李宗仁不接受和谈，罗隆基又感慨地说：“中共的八款二十四条在词句上太厉害了，使李宗仁面子上下不去，所以使和谈破裂。”解放军已经过了长江，罗隆基还在为反动统治阶级惋惜。他自己说是拥护共产党的，实际上他是站在反动统治阶级立场说话，进行反共反人民的阴谋。更加恶毒的是：上海解放前夕，罗还想把张澜主席拖到美国领事馆去，他在给我的信上说，“当年昆明美国领事馆就收容了六教授，现在的上海美国领事馆为什么不能吸收我和张澜？”后来，地下党为了营救张澜主席，也把他营救了出来。他却念念不忘特务的恩典，和特务拜把子，把特务阎锦文当作恩人要介绍入盟。
    叶笃义是章罗联盟的联络员
    浦熙修还说：为了揭露章罗联盟，我必须揭露叶笃义是章罗联盟的联络员。
    在去年民盟第二次全国代表大会之前，1955年或1956年初，叶笃义曾来看过我。叶笃义说：“章伯钧为了帮助罗隆基进步，想在盟内搞他一下思想，你赞成否？”我说：“章伯钧来搞不行，你应该先去请示统战部。”叶笃义从来不到我家来的，为什么忽然来我家呢？叶笃义临行还惊慌地对我说：“此事你可千万别告诉人。”这有什么不可告人之处呢？这就是叶笃义在章罗之间牵线的开始。后来罗隆基果然表示了他的力量只及章伯钧的四分之一。从此，不但不骂章伯钧，并且在民盟第二次全国代表大会中表示和章伯钧合作了。
    张东荪事件被揭发以后，叶笃义有一个时期和罗隆基是比较疏远的，但章罗合作后，叶笃义又经常奔走于罗隆基的门下了。有一次我在罗处碰见叶，叶对罗说：“我现在可以大大方方，放心大胆地到你家了，不怕人家说我和你搞宗派了”。这就是章罗联盟已经酝酿成熟，叶笃义充当了章罗联盟的联络员。后来，罗隆基又提名叶笃义为政协副秘书长，叫叶笃义加倍为章罗联盟卖力讨好。去年我在北戴河一个星期，我确实没有看见章伯钧到罗隆基家来，而章罗联盟许多事都是通过叶笃义这个联络员进行的。那时叶笃义来看罗隆基的次数最多，罗隆基对于民盟提出的一百五十多条意见也是由叶笃义转达章伯钧的，罗隆基要策划阴谋，与人约谈，都是由叶笃义去约的。
    叶笃义在统战部座谈会要成立一个知识分子政党的荒谬发言，也就是罗隆基的意见。罗隆基曾经对我说过，民主党派只要有民革、民建、民盟就够了，这三个民主党派对象明确。而民盟与民进、农工、九三的对象就夹杂不清，都是以知识分子为对象，为什么不合并在一起呢？叶笃义这个发言绝不是偶然的。
      罗隆基说近三年没有进行反党小集团活动，可是去年还开过秘密会议
    接着，浦熙修还揭露了一个重要的事实，她说：孙大雨诬告共产党员为反革命分子的案件是事先经过罗隆基策划、曾昭抡同意的。去年民盟第二次全国代表大会期间，罗隆基曾约曾昭抡、孙大雨、彭文应在他家里密议。我那天到罗隆基家去，因为事先没有打电话就碰上了这个秘密会议。当时罗隆基正对孙大雨说，你的八万字的报告，（内容是诬蔑共产党员为反革命分子——编者注），我费了一晚的工夫都看完了，我看现在提出来不妥当。罗隆基又向曾昭抡说，你看怎样？曾昭抡也说：“现在提出来是不妥当的。”于是曾对孙大雨说：“既然你目前在复旦搞不好，我设法叫你去杭州休假一年，你可以暂时在杭州研究莎士比亚，照样拿薪水，照样是教授的名义。”孙大雨当时表示接受罗、曾的意见。在大鸣大放期间，孙大雨认为时机到了，就积极地把诬蔑共产党员为反革命分子事在上海市委宣传工作会议上提了出来，向党进行了猖狂的进攻。
  当时罗隆基又对彭文应说：“你的问题和孙大雨不同，我主张你仍留在上海。上海沈志远对你团结得很好，上海民盟副主任委员仍有你的份。你到北京来干什么呢？”当时彭文应想调北京工作，要罗隆基设法调动，而罗隆基不肯放弃上海的据点。
    罗隆基抵赖近三年来和他的反党小集团没有什么联系，并且没有小集团的组织，只是精神上的联系。这一个秘密会议就是他的反党小集团仍然存在的铁证，罗隆基是无法狡辩的。
    浦熙修最后说，罗隆基一再否认他的反动小集团的成员之一周鲸文在去香港前曾和他密谈过的事实，但是他亲口告诉过我：周鲸文临去香港前，我找他来谈过。
