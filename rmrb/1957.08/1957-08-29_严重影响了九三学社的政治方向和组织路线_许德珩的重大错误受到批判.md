　　Xu Deheng's Major Errors Criticized, Seriously Affecting the Political Direction and Organizational Line of the Jiusan Society

    The Jiusan Society Central Standing Committee Expanded Meeting passed a resolution condemning his errors in distributing erroneous transmission records, insisting on large-scale development regardless of circumstances, and his personal dictatorial style.

    The Jiusan Society Central Standing Committee held its 18th, 19th, and 20th expanded meetings on August 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 11th, respectively, to criticize Jiusan Society Chairman Xu Deheng's major errors regarding the distribution of erroneous records concerning the "abolition of the Party committee system in higher education," his consistent insistence on large-scale development over the past two years, and his long-standing personal dictatorial style. The meeting was chaired by Tu Changwang, Secretary-General of the Jiusan Society Central Committee and Deputy Director of the Jiusan Society Central Rectification Work Committee. Attendees included Jiusan Society Vice Chairman Liang Xi and all Central Committee members in Beijing: Yan Jici, Li Jinxi, Zhou Peiyuan, Wu Xuezhou, Sun Chengpei, Wei Jiangong, Lao Junzhan, Yang Zhongjian, Wang Zhixiang, Xue Gongchuo, Zhao Jiuzhang, Yin Zanxun, Huang Jiqing, Ye Gongshao, Liu Jichen, Jin Kemu, Li Yi, and thirty-seven others. Some full-time cadres and heads of grassroots organizations also participated.

    Many comrades at the meeting pointed out: The erroneous transmission records concerning the "abolition of the school Party committee system," which were copied from the China Democratic League and tampered with by rightists such as Zhang Bojun, were carefully revised and signed by Xu Deheng before being issued. Subsequently, a notice was distributed to universally arrange for transmission and discussion. The issuance of this erroneous document led many local and grassroots organizations of the Jiusan Society and its members to adopt incorrect political directions during the blooming and contending period, sparking fires in many universities, bringing irreparable losses to the Party, the people, and the Jiusan Society.

    Many comrades at the meeting pointed out: In the past two years, Xu Deheng, regardless of the circumstances, insisted on large-scale development, pursuing quantity one-sidedly, neglecting political quality, focusing only on development and not on consolidation, focusing only on development and not on ideological remolding. This not only seriously violated the organizational work principles stipulated by previous Jiusan Society meetings, but also resulted in many local and grassroots organizations of the Jiusan Society being controlled by rightists, turning them into small anti-Party and anti-socialist cliques.

    Many comrades at the meeting also pointed out: Xu Deheng's consistent personal dictatorial style seriously undermined the democratic centralism and collective leadership principles within the Society and seriously detached him from reality and the masses. The above two major errors are closely related to his personal prominence, dictatorial behavior, and ideological style of not following organizational principles and procedures.

    Many comrades at the meeting further pointed out: Xu Deheng's errors have ideological roots. Since liberation, he has not seriously engaged in ideological remolding, and his personal fame and status mentality is very strong. Especially since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" last year, his bourgeois ideology has developed further, and he is even unwilling for Jiusan Society members to join the Communist Party. Therefore, many comrades solemnly pointed out: Xu Deheng has leaned to the right in the past year or so. Moreover, under his leadership, the political direction and organizational line of the Jiusan Society have also been greatly affected in the past year or so, developing to a serious extent during the blooming and contending period.

    At the meeting, Xu Deheng made two self-criticisms. In the second self-criticism, he initially recognized the seriousness of his mistakes, but his exploration of the ideological roots of his mistakes was not profound enough. He admitted that on the issue of the Party committee system in higher education, "my position wavered, and I failed to notice Zhang Bojun's anti-Party tampering, resonating with him and causing serious errors in class stand." He admitted that in organizational matters, "there are still vulgar ideas of large and small parties, and comparing oneself with other parties." He also realized that "if development continues like this, not only will 'Jiusan' not become a political party serving socialism, but on the contrary, it will inevitably embark on the road of a bourgeois political party." Finally, he said: "This anti-rightist struggle has saved the Jiusan Society and has also sounded the alarm for me, making me realize the serious harm of bourgeois individualism and that old intellectuals who are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology cannot truly serve socialism without thoroughly carrying out ideological remolding."

    The meeting on August 11th passed the "Decision on the Errors Committed by Chairman Xu Deheng," which pointed out and condemned Xu Deheng's errors in distributing erroneous transmission records, insisting on large-scale development regardless of circumstances, and his personal dictatorial style. It also instructed Xu Deheng to continue his self-criticism and requested all levels of organizations and members to provide opinions, urging the Central Committee of the Society to carry out the rectification in depth. In the past few years, the Jiusan Society has played a positive role in helping the Party and the government unite and educate a group of senior intellectuals; however, due to the pursuit of unprincipled large-scale development in recent years and the abandonment of ideological remolding of its members, rightists have gained power in many organizations. Xu Deheng's errors have hindered the anti-rightist struggle. After this criticism, it is hoped that all levels of organizations of the Jiusan Society will resolutely overcome various kinds of wavering and right-leaning in the anti-rightist struggle, carry the struggle through to the end, and achieve complete victory, so that Jiusan, under the leadership of the Communist Party, can truly become a tool for serving socialism.

　　严重影响了九三学社的政治方向和组织路线
　　许德珩的重大错误受到批判
    九三学社中央常委扩大会议通过决定，谴责他批发错误的传达记录，不顾一切的坚持大发展和个人专断作风等错误。
    新华社28日讯　九三学社中央常务委员会于8月3日、4日、7日、8日、11日分别举行了第十八次、十九次、二十次扩大会议，批判九三学社主席许德珩关于批发
  “撤消高等学校党委制”的错误记录、近二年来他所一贯坚持的大发展和长时期以来他的个人专断作风等重大错误。会议由九三学社中央委员会秘书长兼九三学社中央整风工作委员会副主任委员涂长望主持。到会的有九三学社副主席梁希和全体在京中委严济慈、黎锦熙、周培源、吴学周、孙承佩、魏建功、劳君展、杨锺健、王之相、薛公绰、赵九章、尹赞勋、黄汲清、叶恭绍、刘及辰、金克木、李毅等三十七人，部分专职干部和基层组织负责人也参加了会议。
    会上很多同志指出：从民盟借抄的经章伯钧等右派分子篡改了的关于“撤消学校党委制”错误的传达记录，是经过许德珩仔细批改后签发的，并且接着还批发了普遍布置传达讨论的通知。由于这一错误文件的下达，在鸣放期间给九三学社很多的地方组织、基层组织和社员引出了错误的政治方向，在不少高等学校起了点火作用，给党、给人民、给九三学社带来了不可弥补的损失。
    会上很多同志指出：近二年来许德珩不顾一切地坚持大发展，一味追求数量，不问政治质量，只注意发展，不注意巩固，只注意发展，不注意思想改造，这不仅严重地违反了九三学社历次会议所规定的组织工作原则，而且已经使九三学社不少地方组织和基层组织为右派分子所控制，变成了右派分子反党反社会主义的小集团。
    会上很多同志还指出：许德珩一贯的个人专断作风，严重地破坏了社内的民主集中制和集体领导原则，严重地脱离实际脱离群众，以上两大错误就与他的个人突出、独断专行、不按组织原则和组织手续办事的思想作风有密切关系。
    会上很多同志还指出：许德珩的错误是有思想根源的。解放以来，他没有认真地进行过思想改造，个人名位观念很重，特别是去年中共中央提出“长期共存、互相监督”方针以来，他的资产阶级思想更有所发展，甚至不愿意九三学社社员加入共产党。所以很多同志严肃地指出：一年多来许德珩右倾了。而且，在他的领导下，一年多来九三学社的政治方向和组织路线也受到很大影响，到鸣放时期，已发展到严重程度。
    在会上，许德珩作了两次检讨，在第二次检讨中，他初步认识到所犯错误的严重性，但在发掘错误的思想根源方面，则很不深刻。他承认在高等学校党委制问题上，“立场动摇，对于章伯钧的反党篡改，竟然不加觉察，与他共鸣，造成严重的阶级立场上的错误”；他承认在组织问题上“还存在着大党派、小党派以及与别的党派比高低的庸俗思想。”并认识到“像这样发展下去，不但不能使‘九三’成为一个为社会主义服务的政党，相反，必然会走上资产阶级政党的道路。”最后，他说：“这次反右斗争，救了九三学社，也给我敲了警钟，使我认识到资产阶级个人主义思想的严重危害性，认识到受资产阶级思想影响深重的旧知识分子，若不彻底地进行思想改造，是不能真正为社会主义服务的。”
    在8月11日的会议上通过“关于许德珩主席所犯错误的决定”，决定中指出并谴责了许德珩关于批发错误的传达记录、不顾一切的坚持大发展和他的个人专断作风等错误。还责成许德珩继续进行检查，并要求各级组织和社员提供意见，督促社中央整风深入进行。九三学社过去几年曾经在帮助党和政府团结教育一部分高级知识分子方面起过一些积极作用；但是由于近年来追求无原则的大发展，放弃社员的思想改造工作，致使右派分子在许多组织中得势。许德珩的错误对反右派斗争起了阻碍作用，经过这次批判之后，希望九三学社各级组织在反右派斗争中坚决克服各种各样的摇摆和右倾，把斗争进行到底，取得全胜，使九三在共产党领导下，真正成为为社会主义服务的工具。
