Saving Cotton Fabric is Everyone's Responsibility
　　Factories Have Plenty of Waste; Use Millions of Bolts
　　This newspaper reports: According to the Heilongjiang Daily, the Harbin Garment Factory, Rubber Factory, Wire Factory, Sugar Factory, Songjiang Chemical Factory, and Beixin Rubber Factory in Harbin City can save tens of thousands of bolts of production fabric this year.
　　In the past, the Harbin Wire Factory had to wrap the aluminum rubber wire with rubberized cloth before applying the rubber. This year, the factory's workers and technicians, after repeated experiments, changed the process for wires under 35 mm by using a rubber extrusion machine to heat and extrude the rubber onto the wire. After technical appraisal, the products all passed the quality standards. This can save 5,776 bolts of cotton fabric a year. The Songjiang Chemical Factory now uses grass sacks instead of cloth bags for packaging fertilizer, which will save the country 600,000 feet of cotton fabric annually, and also reduce the cost of each bag by 1.5 yuan. The filter cloth used by the Harbin Sugar Factory used to last only one to two years. Due to improved operating techniques, it can now be used for five to six years. If calculated on an additional three years of use, this can save the country 1,250 bundles of cotton yarn, which can be used to weave 5,250 bolts of twill fabric. The Harbin Garment Factory improved its cutting methods when processing garments, minimizing fabric scraps, and saved more than 33,000 feet of cotton fabric in the first quarter.

　　Work Clothes, Steamer Cloths
　　There are Ways to Save Everywhere
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th: Factories, enterprises, organizations, schools, and other units in Tianjin saved more than 1.35 million feet of cotton fabric in the first half of this year. This amount of fabric is enough to make a set of clothes for 100,000 people.
　　The Municipal Dredging Company originally planned to purchase more than 33,000 feet of fabric to make work clothes. After the staff of the First Cotton Fabric General Store calculated the costs in detail with them, they purchased 5,000 feet less. Municipal First, Second, and Workers' Hospitals, and other units, use waste cloth scraps, washed and disinfected, as diapers, saving more than 2,000 feet of cotton fabric in June and July alone. The canteens of various units in the Hebei District use waste cloth scraps as steamer cloths and for covering steamed buns, saving a total of more than 7,000 feet of cotton fabric in four months.

　　Clever Cutting for Remodeling Old Clothes; Seamstresses Have Many Tricks
　　This newspaper reports: According to the Liaoning Daily, many sewing production cooperatives in Liaoning Province are actively finding ways to save cotton fabric. The 21st Sewing Cooperative in Shenyang alone, after researching six new fabric usages for clothing, can save three to five inches of cotton fabric for each garment made.
　　Remodeling old cotton clothes is a good way for sewing production cooperatives to save cotton fabric. The Gaiping Town Sewing Production Cooperative in Gaiping County used this method to save 50,000 feet of cotton fabric in the first half of this year. The 50th and 51st Sewing Cooperatives in the Beishi and Shenhe Districts of Shenyang City used the method of repairing old clothes to remake more than 4,000 pieces of clothing for residents in one quarter, saving a lot of cotton fabric. The Gaiping Town Sewing Cooperative purchased 4,171 jin of old mosquito net fabric and 2,100 feet of old rainproof cloth from Anshan City, and after disassembling, washing, and repairing them, turned them into 8,400 pieces of clothing items such as undershirts, aprons, shoe covers, anti-scalding gloves, and briefcases.
　　Sewing production cooperatives in various places also try to use waste clothing materials to save good fabric. The Tieling County Hat Cooperative specially purchased a large batch of waste flour sacks and cloth scraps from other places in January and used them to produce 37,200 hats. These hats are of good quality, beautiful in appearance, and each retails for 0.043 yuan less. The Second Hat Making Cooperative in the Beiguan District of Shenyang uses the cloth scraps left over from cutting hats to make insoles. Based on this year's processing task of 700,000 hats, the leftover material can make 20,000 pairs of insoles, equivalent to more than 2,600 feet of good fabric. The No. 9 Hat Making Cooperative in Shenyang used waste materials and cloth scraps to produce more than 6,000 various stylish hats in the first half of the year.

    节约棉布　人人有责
    工厂油水大　动辄千万匹
    本报讯　据黑龙江日报消息：哈尔滨市哈尔滨服装厂、橡胶厂、电线厂、糖厂、松江化学厂、北新橡胶厂等单位，今年可以节约数万匹生产用布。
    哈尔滨电线厂过去生产的铝橡皮线都要用胶布缠好以后再挂胶，这个厂的工人和技术人员今年经过反复试验，改变为三十五公厘以下的用挤橡机把胶加热后挤到线上，经过技术鉴定，产品全部合格。这样一年即可节约五千七百七十六匹棉布。松江化学厂生产的肥田粉，今年全部用草袋代替了布袋包装，全年可为国家节约六十万尺棉布，每个袋子的成本因此也降低了一元五角。哈尔滨糖厂的过滤用布，过去只能使用一年至两年，由于改进了操作技术，现在已经可以使用五年至六年，如以多使三年计算，即可为国家节约一千二百五十捆棉纱，可以用来织斜纹布五千二百五十匹。哈尔滨服装厂在加工服装时改进了套裁方法，尽量不出布头，第一季度就节省棉布三万三千多尺。
    工作服　笼屉布
    节约处处有门路
    据新华社天津12日电　天津市各工厂、企业、团体、学校等单位，在今年上半年共节约了一百三十五万多尺棉布，这些布约可供十万人每人做一套衣服。
    市疏浚公司原计划购布三万三千多尺制做工作服，经第一棉布总店工作人员和他们算细账以后，就少买了五千尺。市立第一，第二医院和工人医院等单位，用废包皮布洗净消毒后作尿布，仅6、7月两就节约棉布二千多尺。河北区各单位食堂使用废包皮布作笼屉布、盖馒头布，在四个月中共节约棉布七千多尺。
    拆旧翻新巧裁剪　缝纫工人窍门多
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：辽宁省许多缝纫生产合作社积极想办法节约棉布。仅沈阳市第二十一缝纫社研究出六种衣裳的新用布量以后，每做一件衣服就能节省三寸到五寸的棉布。
    棉服的拆旧翻新是缝纫生产合作社节约棉布的一个好办法。盖平县盖平镇缝纫生产社利用这个办法，今年上半年就节省了五万尺棉布。沈阳市北市区和沈河区的第五十、五十一缝纫社利用补旧翻新的办法，一个季度替居民改做了四千多件衣服，节省了很多棉布。盖平镇缝纫社从鞍山市收购旧蚊帐布四千一百七十一斤、旧防雨布二千一百尺，经过拆洗修补，改制成了汗衫、围裙、鞋盖、防垫手套、公文包等八千四百件衣物。
    各地缝纫生产社还尽量利用废旧衣料，节省好布。铁岭县帽业社一月份特意从外地收购了大批废旧面袋、布头，用它们来生产出帽子三万七千二百顶。这些帽子的质量好，外表美观，每顶零售价还低廉四分三厘。沈阳北关区第二制帽社用裁帽时剩下的布角做鞋垫，按今年加工七十万顶帽子任务计算，剩料能做出二万双鞋垫，合好布二千六百多尺。沈阳第九制帽社利用废料、布头，上半年生产出各种式样新颖的帽子六千多顶。
