    Shouting that China will definitely have a Hungarian Incident
    Rightist Xu Quanwei is criticized
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Rightist Xu Quanwei, an actor from the Guangdong Drama Troupe, who openly clamored that "China will definitely have a Hungarian incident in the future" and declared that he would "definitely participate in it," has been criticized. This rightist openly said in many meetings: "If there are two more movements like the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, I will join the Kuomintang, go to Hong Kong to be a special agent, and take a machine gun to sweep you to death." He and another rightist, Huang Zhichao, who had killed guerrillas and is now clamoring to dig out the hearts of Communist Party members and drink the blood of Communist Party members, echoed each other within the troupe and attacked the Party.

    叫嚣中国一定会有匈牙利事件
    右派分子许权伟受到批判
    新华社专稿　公开叫嚣“中国将来一定会来一次匈牙利事件”，并且声言“一定参加进去”的广东话剧团演员右派分子许权伟受到批判。这个右派分子在许多次会议上公开地说：“如果再搞两次像肃反这样的运动，我便参加国民党，到香港当特务，拿机关枪回来扫死你们。”他和另一个曾经杀死过游击队员，现在还叫嚣要挖共产党员的心、饮共产党员的血的右派分子黄志超，在剧团内互相呼应，向党进攻。
