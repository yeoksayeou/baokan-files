Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, August 19th: The West German Social Democratic Party accused West German Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union on August 18th of emulating Nazi stormtroopers and the SS in its current parliamentary election campaign by engaging in acts of terror.

The opposition party's press chief and campaign director, Fritz Heine, stated to the press: "The Christian Democratic Union's stormtroopers and SS youth leagues are conducting open acts of terror against the Social Democratic Party's campaign propaganda." They have "damaged, defaced, or stolen" Social Democratic campaign posters, and have dispatched "gangs of thugs who noisily disrupt" Social Democratic meetings, and even "attempted to overturn the cars of Social Democratic speakers."

Heine believes that Adenauer himself should be held responsible for these acts of terror, because he made speeches slandering the Social Democratic Party and poisoning the West German political atmosphere.

    西德社会民主党
    指责阿登纳党破坏竞选
    新华社19日讯　波恩消息：西德社会民主党在8月18日指责西德总理阿登纳的基督教民主联盟目前在议会选举的竞选运动中仿效纳粹突击队和党卫军，进行恐怖活动。
    这个反对党的新闻首脑和竞选运动负责人弗里茨·海涅向报界发表声明说：“基督教民主党的突击队和党卫军青年联盟针对社会民主党的竞选宣传进行公开的恐怖活动。”他们“弄坏、弄脏或者偷走了”社会民主党的竞选招贴，并且派出“成群结队的打手大叫大闹地捣乱”社会民主党的会议，甚至“企图推倒社会民主党讲演者的汽车”。
    海涅认为，阿登纳本人应该对这些恐怖活动负责，因为他发表诬蔑社会民主党的演说，毒化西德政治气氛。
