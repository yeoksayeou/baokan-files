Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, August 11th: According to a recent investigation, 1,990 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the Linyi Prefecture of Shandong Province have reached a level of consolidation where they "cannot be blown away by the wind."

These agricultural cooperatives have a history of more than three years. They have relatively sound management systems, and their production levels have improved significantly. The lives of members in a considerable number of these cooperatives have generally reached or exceeded the level of well-to-do middle peasants, and the lives of members in the rest of the cooperatives are also approaching this level. In Junan County, where the cooperative movement has a relatively good foundation, 221 cooperatives, accounting for 21.27% of the total number of cooperatives in the county, have reached or exceeded the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants. Last year, the average income per person in these cooperatives was around 70 yuan. The Qizhi Cooperative in Shigou Township of this county was mostly grain-deficient households when it was first established in early 1952. Two years ago, there were still 60 grain-deficient households in the entire cooperative. By last year, not only was there no grain-deficient household, but it also sold 47,400 jin of surplus grain, with an average income of 77 yuan per member. The Hongxing No. 1 Cooperative in Baichang Township of this county has been running for four years, and its grain output has increased from an average of 196 jin per mu to 584 jin. Last year, the average income per person was 79 yuan.

In the deep mountains of the Yimeng Mountain area, the lives of members of many cooperatives have also reached this level. In Mengyin County, where mountains account for 83% of the area, there are 37 such cooperatives.

The socialist consciousness of the members of these agricultural cooperatives has been greatly improved. The cooperatives regularly use examples to educate members about the superiority of the cooperative system and conduct regular evaluations based on the production season to cultivate and consolidate the collective spirit of the members. Therefore, more and more model figures are emerging in these cooperatives. In the Dashan Cooperative in Lizhai Township of Junan County, 270 model members were selected in the past year. More than 70 lazy people who were famous in the past have now become good members who actively participate in labor, and five of them have been elected as production team leaders or accountants.

There are 10,053 cooperatives in the Linyi Prefecture. In addition to the 1,990 that have reached the point of being unshakeable, another 5,613 cooperatives have also been basically consolidated. In addition, a small number of agricultural cooperatives have more problems because they have not been established for long.

    “风吹不动”的1990个农业社
    据新华社临沂11日电　据最近调查，山东省临沂专区已经有一千九百九十个农业生产合作社到达“风吹不动”的巩固程度。
    这些农业社都有了三年以上的历史，它们已经有比较健全的经营管理制度，生产水平有了显著提高，其中有相当一部分社的社员生活，已经普遍达到或超过了富裕中农的水平，一般的也已接近这个水平。在合作化运动基础较好的莒南县，社员生活达到或超过富裕中农水平的社有二百二十一个，占全县总社数的21.27％，去年这些社每人平均收入在七十元上下。这个县仕沟乡的旗帜社在1952年初建时，多半社员是缺粮户，前年全社还有六十户缺粮。到去年，不但没有一户缺粮，还卖了四万七千四百斤余粮，每个社员平均收入七十七元。这个县白常乡的红星一社办了四年，粮食产量从每亩平均一百九十六斤提高到五百八十四斤，去年每人平均收入七十九元。
    在沂蒙山区的深山里，也有不少社的社员生活达到了这样的水平。山地占83％的蒙阴县，这样的社就有三十七个。
    这些农业社社员的社会主义觉悟有了很大提高。社里经常用实例向社员进行合作化制度优越性的教育，并且按生产季节定期进行评比，来培养和巩固社员的集体主义观念。所以在这些社里，愈来愈多地涌现出各种各样的模范人物。莒南县厉寨乡大山社，一年来就评出模范社员二百七十名，过去有名的七十多个懒汉，现在也成了积极参加劳动的好社员，其中还有五个当选为生产队长或会计。
    临沂专区共有一万零五十三个社，除了其中的一千九百九十个已经达到风吹不动的程度以外，还有五千六百十三个社也已经基本上巩固。另外，还有小部分农业社，因为历史不长，存在着比较多的问题。
