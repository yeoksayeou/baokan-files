Moscow, August 6th (By our own correspondent) On the evening of August 5th, young women from various countries participating in the festival jointly spent a wonderful and joyful holiday – International Youth Day.

　　Two thousand young women gathered at the Soviet Army Theater, each wearing a small cloth flower on their chest. This was a gift from the Women's International Democratic Federation, and this beautiful flower symbolizes peace and friendship. At the meeting, representatives from the United States, Britain, China, Italy, France, Japan, the Soviet Union, and other countries expressed the wishes of the women of their countries for peace and friendship, and their opposition to war and demands for the prohibition of atomic weapons. Liu Ying, a female tractor driver from China, said: "For us, peace is happiness, is the progress of mankind. With peace, our wisdom can be truly brought into play; with peace, our children can truly grow up. Therefore, the slogan of the Sixth World Youth Festival, 'For Peace and Friendship,' is the call in our hearts."

　　After the meeting, there was a traditional festival program - a national costume show. Young people from more than a dozen countries, wearing various beautiful national costumes, participated in the performance. At the end of the national costume show, actresses from various countries stood on the stage to take a bow amidst a shower of flowers. At this time, the stage and the audience threw bouquets at each other for as long as ten minutes, and the slogan "Long live peace and friendship" resounded throughout the theater hall.

    “为了和平与友谊！”
    各国女青年欢度女青年节
    本报莫斯科6日电　8月5日晚上，参加联欢节的各国的女青年们，共同度过了一个美妙的欢乐的节日——女青年节。
    在苏军剧院集会的二千女青年，每人胸前都戴上一枚布制的小花。这是世界民主妇联赠给她们的，这朵美丽的小花象征着和平与友谊。在会上，美、英、中、意、法、日、苏等国的代表都表达了自己国家的妇女们对于和平与友谊的愿望，反对战争和要求禁止原子武器的愿望。我国的女拖拉机手刘瑛说：“对于我们来说，和平就是幸福，就是人类的进步。有了和平，我们的智慧才能真正地发挥；有了和平，我们的儿女才能真正地成长。因此，第六届世界青年联欢节的口号‘为了和平与友谊’，就是我们心中的呼声。”
    会后进行了联欢节传统的节目——民族服装表演。穿着各种美丽民族服装的十几个国家的青年们参加了表演。民族服装表演结束时，各国女演员们在花雨缤纷中站在台上谢幕。这时，台下台上互抛花束达十分钟之久，“和平与友谊万岁”的口号声响彻了剧院的大厅。
