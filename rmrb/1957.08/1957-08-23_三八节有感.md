　　Thoughts on the March 8th Festival
　　Ding Ling
　　When will the words "women" no longer be valued and not need to be specially mentioned?
    Every year has this day. Every year on this day, almost everywhere in the world, meetings are held, reviewing their ranks. Although Yan'an is not as lively as it was in previous years, there always seem to be a few people busy there. And there are always big meetings, speeches, telegrams, and articles published.
    The women of Yan'an are happier than women in other parts of China. Many people even enviously say, "Why does millet make the female comrades so rosy and plump?" Female comrades make up a large proportion of those in hospitals, sanatoriums, and clinics, which does not seem surprising. However, the female comrades in Yan'an still cannot escape that fate: no matter what the occasion, they are most likely to be talked about as an interesting topic. And all kinds of female comrades can receive the slander they deserve. These accusations seem serious and appropriate.
    The marriage of female comrades always attracts attention and never satisfies people. They cannot be too close to one male comrade, let alone several. They are satirized by painters: "Even a section chief got married?" Poets also say: "In Yan'an, there are only riding-horse leaders, not artist leaders. Artists cannot find beautiful lovers in Yan'an." However, they also listen to such admonishments in some occasions: "Damn it, looking down on us old cadres, calling us bumpkins. If it weren't for us bumpkins, would you be able to come to Yan'an to eat millet!" But women always have to get married. (Not getting married is even more sinful, and she will be more of an object of rumors, forever slandered.) It's either a riding-horse guy or someone wearing straw sandals, either an artist or a general affairs section chief. They all have to have children. The children also have their own destinies: some are wrapped in fine wool yarn and flannel, held in the arms of a nanny, and some are wrapped in unwashed cloth, thrown on the head of the bed crying, while the mother and father are gorging on the child's allowance (twenty-five yuan a month, worth two and a half catties of pork). If it weren't for this allowance, they might not even taste meat at all. However, who should the female comrades marry after all? The fact is that those forced to take care of children will definitely receive public ridicule: "Nora who returned to the family." And the female comrades who have nannies can have one day of the most hygienic social dance every week. Although unparalleled slander will be spread quietly behind their backs, as long as she goes there, it will be lively, and the eyes of those riding horses, wearing straw sandals, general affairs section chiefs, and artists will all be on her. This has nothing to do with any theory, any ideology, or any meeting speeches. However, this is the reality that everyone knows, everyone doesn't say, and everyone is doing.
    The issue of divorce is the same. Generally, when getting married, there are three conditions that must be noted. First, whether one is politically pure; second, whether the age and appearance are similar; and third, whether there is any mutual help. Although these three conditions are almost universally met (there are no open traitors here, and the so-called help can be said to include sewing shoes and socks, and even female comfort), they must be considered grandly, and the excuse for divorce must be the backwardness of the female comrade. I think it is most shameful for a woman to be backward and still drag her husband down, but let us see how they are backward. Before they got married, they all had soaring ambitions and a hard-fighting life. They got married under the physiological demands and the secret words of "mutual help," and then they were forced to become the hard-working Nora who returned to the family. They were also afraid of the danger of "backwardness," so they ran around. Shamelessly asking the nursery to take in their children, asking for curettage, and would rather accept all punishments and have to risk their lives to secretly take abortion pills. And they hear such answers! "Isn't taking care of children work? You only covet comfort, aim too high, and what great political work have you done? Since you are so afraid of having children, and you are not willing to take responsibility after giving birth, who told you to get married?" So they cannot escape the fate of "backwardness." A woman who has the ability to work, and can still sacrifice her career to be a good wife and mother, may not be praised, but after more than ten years, she will inevitably not escape the tragedy of "backwardness." Even today, from the perspective of a woman, these "backward" elements are really not lovely women. Their skin is beginning to wrinkle, their hair is thinning, and the weariness of life takes away their last bit of charm. They are in such a tragic fate, which seems very natural, but in the old society, they might be called pitiful and ill-fated, but today, they are self-inflicted and deserve it. Isn't it said that the law is still arguing about whether divorce only requires one party to propose, or both parties must agree? Divorces are mostly proposed by men, and if it is a woman, then there must be something even more immoral, and the woman should be cursed completely.
    I myself am a woman, and I understand women's shortcomings better than others, but I understand women's pain even more. They will not be super-era, will not be ideal, they are not made of iron. They cannot resist all the temptations and silent oppressions of society, and each of them has a history of blood and tears, and has had lofty emotions (whether rising or falling, whether fortunate or unfortunate, whether still fighting alone or involved in vulgarity). This is even more true for the female comrades who came to Yan'an, so I look at all those who have been reduced to female criminals with great tolerance. And I hope even more that men, especially men in positions, and women themselves will see these women's faults as connected to society. Make fewer empty comments, talk more about practical issues, so that theory and practice are not separated, and every Communist Party member is responsible for himself in his cultivation.
    However, we cannot but have some small hopes for the female comrades, especially the female comrades in Yan'an. And encourage ourselves, encourage our friends.
    There has never been an incompetent person in the world who is qualified to obtain everything. Therefore, women must first strengthen themselves in order to achieve equality. I don't need to say what everyone understands. Moreover, someone will definitely give a speech today: the grand theory of "first obtaining our political power." I only say the matters that must be paid attention to every day as a member of a front (whether it is the proletariat, the War of Resistance, or women).
    First, don't let yourself get sick. An unrestrained life may sometimes feel romantic, poetic, and lovely, but it is not suitable for today's environment. No one can love your life more than you do. Nothing is more unfortunate than losing your health today. Only it is closest to you, so take good care of it and cherish it.
    Second, make yourself happy. Only in happiness can there be youth, vitality, a feeling of fullness in life, a feeling of being able to bear all hardships, a future, and enjoyment. This kind of happiness is not the satisfaction of life, but the struggle and progress of life. Therefore, you must do some meaningful work every day, you must read some books, and you must be able to give something to others. Laziness only makes people feel the emptiness, weakness, and withering of life.
    Third, use your brain, it is best to develop it into a habit. Correct the bad habit of not thinking and going with the flow. Every time you say a word, every time you do something, it is best to think about whether this word is correct? Is this matter handled properly, does it not violate your principles of being a person, and can you be responsible for it yourself. Only in this way will you not regret it, this is called going through reason, so you will not be fooled, be blinded by all the sweetness, be tempted by small profits, and will not waste your enthusiasm, waste your life, and avoid troubles.
    Fourth, make the determination to endure hardship and persevere to the end. Born as a modern, enlightened woman, you must recognize the sacrifice of all rosy and gentle dreams. Happiness is the struggle in the storm, not playing the piano under the moon and chanting poems in front of flowers. If you don't have the greatest determination, you will definitely stop halfway. Not being miserable means being depraved. And this strength to support oneself must be cultivated in "perseverance." People without great ambitions find it difficult to have this kind of unwavering persistence that does not covet cheapness and does not seek comfort. And this ambition can only be had by those who are truly for humanity, not for themselves.
                      Morning of the March 8th Festival
    Attached: After the article has been written, I reviewed it again, and felt that there were still many opinions regarding the place of hope, but due to limited publication time, I could not organize it. However, I had this feeling again, that some words, if spoken by a leader in a large meeting, might be considered pleasant. However, writing it under the pen of a woman is very disposable. But since I have written it, I will still let those who have the same feelings take a look at it.

### 三八节有感

　　三八节有感
　　丁玲
      “妇女”这两个字，将在什么时代才不被重视，不需要特别的被提出呢？
    年年都有这一天。每年在这一天的时候，几乎是全世界的地方都开着会，检阅着她们的队伍。延安虽说这两年不如前年热闹，但似乎总有几个人在那里忙着。而且一定有大会，有演说的，有通电，有文章发表。
    延安的妇女是比中国其他地方的妇女幸福的。甚至有很多人都在嫉羡的说：“为什么小米把女同志吃得那么红胖？”女同志在医院，在休养所，在门诊部都占着很大的比例，却似乎并没有使人惊奇。然而延安的女同志却仍不能免除那种幸运：不管在什么场合都最能作为有兴趣的问题被谈起。而且各种各样的女同志都可以得到她应得的诽议。这些责难似乎都是严重而确当的。
    女同志的结婚永远使人注意，而不会使人满意的。她们不能同一个男同志比较接近，更不能同几个都接近。她们被画家们讽刺：“一个科长也嫁了么？”诗人们也说：“延安只有骑马的首长，没有艺术家的首长，艺术家在延安是找不到漂亮的情人的。”然而她们也在某种场合聆听着这样的训词：“他妈的，瞧不起我们老干部，说是土包子，要不是我们土包子，你想来延安吃小米！”但女人总是要结婚的。（不结婚更有罪恶，她将更多的被作为制造谣言的对象，永远被污蔑。）不是骑马的就是穿草鞋的，不是艺术家就是总务科长。她们都得生小孩。小孩也有各自的命运：有的被细羊毛线和花绒布包着，抱在保姆的怀里，有的被没有洗净的布片抱着，扔在床头啼哭，而妈妈和爸爸都在大嚼着孩子的津贴，（每月二十五元，价值二斤半猪肉）要是没有这笔津贴，也许他们根本就尝不到肉味。然而女同志究竟应该嫁谁呢，事实是这样，被逼着带孩子的一定可以得到公开的讥讽：“回到家庭了的娜拉。”而有着保姆的女同志，每一个星期可以有一天最卫生的交际舞。虽说在背地里也会有难比的诽语悄声的传播着，然而只要她走到那里，那里就会热闹，不管骑马的，穿草鞋的，总务科长，艺术家们的眼睛都会望着她。这同一切的理论都无关，同一切主义思想也无关，同一切开会演说也无关。然而这都是人人知道，人人不说，而且在做着的现实。
    离婚的问题也是一样。大抵在结婚的时候，有三个条件是必须注意到的。一、政治上纯洁不纯洁，二、年龄相貌差不多，三、彼此有无帮助。虽说这三个条件几乎是人人具备，（公开的汉奸这里是没有的。而所谓帮助也可以说到鞋袜的缝补，甚至女性的安慰）。但却一定堂皇的考虑到，而离婚的口实，一定是女同志的落后。我是最以为一个女人自己不进步而还要拖住她的丈夫为可耻的，可是让我们看一看她们是如何落后的。她们在没有结婚前都抱着有凌云的志向，和克苦的斗争生活，她们在生理的要求和“彼此帮助”的密语之下结婚了，于是她们被逼着做了操劳的回到家庭的娜拉。她们也唯恐有“落后”的危险，她们四方奔走。厚颜的要求托儿所收留她们的孩子，要求刮子宫，宁肯受一切处分而不得不冒着生命的危险悄悄的去吃着坠胎的药。而她们听着这样的回答！“带孩子不是工作吗。你们只贪图舒服，好高骛远，你们到底作过一些什么了不起的政治工作。既然这样怕生孩子，生了又不肯负责，谁叫你们结婚呢。”于是她们不能免除“落后”的命运。一个有了工作能力的女人，而还能牺牲自己的事业去作为一个贤妻良母的时候，未始不被人歌颂，但在十多年之后，她必然也逃不出“落后”的悲剧。即使在今天以我一个女人去看，这些“落后”分子，也实在不是一个可爱的女人。她们的皮肤在开始有折皱，头发在稀少，生活的疲惫夺取她们最后的一点爱娇。她们处于这样的悲运，似乎是很自然的，但在旧的社会里，她们或许会被称为可怜，薄命，然而在今天，却是自作孽、活该。不是听说法律上还在争论着离婚只须一方提出，或者必须双方同意的问题么？离婚大约多半都是男子提出的，假如是女人，那一定有更不道德的事，那完全该女人受诅咒。
    我自己是女人，我会比别人更懂得女人的缺点，但我却更懂得女人的痛苦。她们不会是超时代的，不会是理想的，她们不是铁打的。她们抵抗不了社会一切的诱惑，和无声的压迫，她们每人都有一部血泪史，都有过崇高的感情，（不管是升起的或沉落的，不管有幸与不幸，不管仍在孤苦奋斗或卷入庸俗，）这在对于来到延安的女同志说来更不冤枉，所以我是拿着很大的宽容来看一切被沦为女犯的人的。而且我更希望男子们尤其是有地位的男子，和女人本身都把这些女人的过错看得与社会有联系些。少发空议论，多谈实际的问题，使理论与实际不脱节，在每个共产党员的修身上都对自己负责些就好了。
    然而我们也不能不对女同志们，尤其是在延安的女同志有些小小的企望。而且勉励着自己，勉励着友好。
    世界上从没有无能的人，有资格去获去一切的。所以女人要取得平等，得首先强己。我不必说大家都懂的。而且，一定在今天会有人演说的：“首先取得我们的政权”的大论，我只说作为一个阵线中的一员（无产阶级也好，抗战也好，妇女也好），每天所必须注意的事项。
    第一、不要让自己生病。无节制的生活，有时会觉得浪漫，有诗意，可爱，然而对今天环境不适宜。没有一个人能比你自己还会爱你的生命些。没有什么东西比今天失去健康更不幸些。只有它同你最亲近，好好注意它，爱护它。
    第二、使自己愉快。只有愉快里面才有青春，才有活力，才觉得生命饱满，才觉得能担受一切磨难，才有前途，才有享受。这种愉快不是生活的满足，而是生活的战斗和进取。所以必须每天都作点有意义的工作，都必须读点书，都能有东西给别人，游惰只使人感到生命的空白、疲软、枯萎。
    第三、用脑子，最好养成为一种习惯。改正不作思索，随波逐流的毛病。每说一句话、每作一件事、最好想想这话是否正确？这事是否处理的得当，不违背自己作人的原则，是否自己可以负责。只有这样才不会后悔，这就是叫通过理性，这才不会上当、被一切甜蜜所蒙蔽、被小利所诱，才不会浪费热情，浪费生命，而免除烦恼。
    第四、下吃苦的决心，坚持到底。生为现代的有觉悟的女人，就要有认定牺牲一切蔷薇色的温柔的梦幻。幸福是暴风雨中的搏斗，而不是在月下弹琴，花前吟诗。假如没有最大的决心，一定会在中途停歇下来。不悲苦，即堕落。而这种支持下去的力量却必须在“有恒”中来养成。没有大的抱负的人是难于有这种不贪便宜，不图舒服的坚忍的。而这种抱负只有真真为人类，而非为己的人才会有。
                      三八节清晨
    附及：文章已经写完了，自己再重看一次，觉得关于企望的地方，还有很多意见，但为发稿时间有限，也不能整理了。不过又有这样的感觉，觉得有些话假如是一个首长在大会中说来，或许有人认为痛快。然而却写在一个女人的笔底下，是很可以取消的。但既然写了仍旧给那些有同感的人看看吧。
