Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 24th: As the struggle against bourgeois rightists in Henan Province has deepened to the grassroots level, a large number of rightist cliques have been exposed and smashed.

Now, the ordinary rightists in these rightist groups have been differentiated, and the deceived middle elements have awakened and have turned around to expose many inside stories of the cliques. The rightist core members of the cliques are already isolated, and most have bowed their heads to the people and confessed their crimes.

This large number of rightist cliques is scattered in various systems such as industrial and mining enterprises, culture and education, finance and trade, and medicine and health. About half of them have been exposed in the past half-month as various departments have gradually overcome right-leaning thoughts and deeply led the masses to carry out persuasive struggles. This is an important feature of the current decisive victory in Henan's anti-rightist struggle.

According to the materials of ten rightist cliques that have been disintegrated in the Xinyang area: more than 60% of the members participating in these cliques are from landlord and capitalist backgrounds, and many of their relatives have been suppressed, controlled, or struggled against according to law. Therefore, the members of these rightist cliques, especially the rightist core members, have deep class hatred for the Communist Party and socialism. For example, the father of Lü Yuanzhou, a rightist core member of Zhengzhou University, had nine cases of murder and has already been suppressed. During this time of great contending and blooming, Lü Yuanzhou actively attacked the Communist Party. Niu Wuqing, the well-known "Fifth Master Niu" in Kaifeng City, was a capitalist who committed all kinds of evils, and he was the leader of the rightist clique in the Henan traditional Chinese medicine circles this time. Some of these rightist cliques have been lurking in the organs for a long time, preparing to wait for an opportunity to act; but most of them were formed during the great contending and blooming because of their consistent anti-Party words and deeds. Many of them were organized and planned to "overthrow" the Communist Party organizations in their departments through this rectification and seize leadership. The Xinyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office defeated a rightist clique headed by Zhang Jinghuan that had been in existence for five years. This clique has consistently been hostile to the Communist Party. During the great contending and blooming, they believed that the time had come, and they secretly plotted to "kill a group of activists," and said: "Killing is not enough to relieve our hatred." They planned to "bring down" the party member leading cadres of the organs and replace them with their own people, saying: "We will not give up until we have avenged our hatred, and we will not have a good life unless we overthrow them." Their struggle strategy was: "Rely on targets of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, unite those who are dissatisfied with the Party, and attack activists." During the great contending and blooming, thirty-nine people who were deceived by this clique have now awakened and are exposing and struggling against the core members of the clique, finally leading to the complete disintegration of this clique. In the twenty days of struggle against the three rightist cliques at Zhengzhou University, forty deceived middle elements conducted exposure and persuasive struggle in countless small meetings and six school-wide teachers and students meetings. As a result, all twelve rightist core members bowed their heads and confessed their crimes. Many materials prove that educating and striving to awaken the deceived elements in the rightist cliques to participate in the anti-rightist struggle is the key to disintegrating the cliques.

### 教育争取被蒙蔽的分子觉醒过来参加斗争　河南打垮一大批右派小集团

　  教育争取被蒙蔽的分子觉醒过来参加斗争
　　河南打垮一大批右派小集团
    据新华社郑州24日电　河南省各地反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争深入到基层以后，已经揭露和打垮了一大批右派小集团。
    现在，这些右派集团中的普通右派分子已经分化，上当的中间分子已经觉醒，并且反过来揭露了小集团的很多内幕活动。小集团中的右派骨干分子已经处于孤立状态，多数已向人民低头认罪。
    这一大批右派集团散布在工矿企业、文化教育、财经贸易、医药卫生等各个系统内，其中约有半数是近半月来由于各个部门逐渐克服右倾思想，深入地领导群众开展说理斗争以后被揭露出来的。这是目前河南反右派斗争取得决定性胜利的一个重要特点。
    据信阳专区已经瓦解的十个右派集团的材料证明：参加这些小集团的成员60％以上是地主、资本家出身，他们的亲属很多是依法被镇压、管制或斗争过。因此，这些右派集团的成员，特别是右派骨干分子，对共产党和社会主义有很深的阶级仇恨。例如郑州大学右派集团骨干分子吕元周的父亲有九条人命案，已被镇压，这次大鸣大放时吕元周就积极地向共产党进攻。开封市人所共知的“牛五爷”（牛悟青）是一个无恶不作的资本家，他是这次河南中医界右派集团的首脑。这些右派集团，有的是长期潜伏在机关里准备待机行事；但大多数是在大鸣大放中由于反党言行一致而形成的。其中不少是有组织有计划地企图通过这次整风把本部门的共产党组织“整垮”，夺取领导权。信阳专署击溃了一个已经有五年历史的以张静环为首的右派集团，这个集团一贯敌视共产党。大鸣大放期间，他们认为时机已到，便密谋“杀一批积极分子”，并说：“杀也不解恨”。他们计划把机关的党员领导干部“整下来”，换上他们的人马，并说：“不报仇雪恨，誓不罢休，不整垮他们，就没有我们过的日子”。他们的斗争策略是：“依靠肃反对象，团结对党不满的人，打击积极分子”。大鸣大放期间，受到这个小集团蒙蔽的三十九个人现在已经清醒过来，对小集团的骨干分子进行揭露和斗争，终于使这个小集团彻底瓦解。郑州大学的三个右派集团在二十天的斗争中，四十名被蒙蔽的中间分子在无数次小会和六次全校师生大会上进行了揭发和说理斗争，结果十二名右派骨干分子全部低头认罪。很多材料证明，教育和争取右派小集团中被蒙蔽的分子觉醒过来参加反右派斗争，是瓦解小集团的关键。
