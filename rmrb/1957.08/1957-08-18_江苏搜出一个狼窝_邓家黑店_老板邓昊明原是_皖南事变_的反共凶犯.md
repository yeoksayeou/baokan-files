Nanjing, August 17th (People's Daily reporter Zhen Weimin) - After two months of anti-rightist struggle, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP) organizations in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, in coordination with transportation departments, the medical and health community, and the cultural and news circles, have exposed a right-wing group headed by Deng Haoming, a staunch anti-communist figure in the "Southern Anhui Incident" and an agent of the Zhang Bojun-Huang Qixiang-Li Boqiu group in Jiangsu.

This right-wing group is quite large. Before the anti-rightist struggle, they excluded dissidents, suppressed progressives, and basically monopolized the leadership of the CPWDP provincial and municipal leadership and many grassroots organizations, turning the CPWDP provincial and municipal organizations into a "Deng Family Black Shop" and using the CPWDP as an anti-communist tool.

According to existing revealed materials, nearly twenty leading members of this reactionary right-wing group have been identified. In the CPWDP provincial and municipal leading organs, there are: Deng Haoming (member of the CPWDP Central Committee, chairman of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, director of the Provincial Department of Transportation), Wu Sigang (member of the CPWDP Provincial Committee, deputy director of the Provincial Handicraft Industry Bureau), Zhu Xie (member of the CPWDP Provincial Committee, deputy director of the Provincial Cultural Bureau), Lu Xu (reporter for Wenhui Daily in Nanjing), and Wu Tiaomei (member of the CPWDP Nanjing Municipal Committee and head of the secretariat). At the grassroots level, there are: Hong Wenpei (chief of the CPWDP branch of the Provincial Transportation and Shipping Bureaus), Jin Songpan (person in charge of the CPWDP branch of the Provincial Health Department), Zhang Zipo (person in charge of the CPWDP branch of Nanjing Pharmaceutical College), and Tang Naigeng (person in charge of the CPWDP branch of the Nanjing Real Estate Bureau). In addition, this group also established strongholds in Changzhou, Yangzhou, and other places with CPWDP organizations. Before the Great Blooming and Contending, Deng Haoming, upon returning from a meeting of the CPWDP Central Executive Bureau, told an engineer in the Department of Transportation on the train: "Zhang Bojun believes that not being a minister is still about expanding the CPWDP and engaging in democratic parties." After returning, he peddled Zhang Bojun's private goods everywhere, such as "China should implement a bicameral system." He actively implemented the "great development" policy of the CPWDP Central Committee's right-wing group. During the blooming and contending process, this right-wing element maliciously fabricated reactionary fallacies such as "The Communist Party has two sets of books for democratic people, a good set when they need you and a bad set when they don't," to incite the masses. He also personally reported to some CPWDP members in Nanjing City, inciting grassroots to start fires. He himself personally lit fires in the Provincial Department of Transportation, the Shipping Bureau, the Nanjing Institute of Technology, and other places.

At the same time, this right-wing group's personnel deployment was also well-rounded and complete. There were bosses, generals, core backbones, henchmen, and liaison officers. The right-wing ringleader Deng Haoming often conveyed his conspiracies to the grassroots through Wu Tiaomei, a confidante and core member who had followed him for more than twenty years. The core figures of this right-wing group, the anti-communist generals Wu Sigang, Zhu Xie, Hong Wenpei, and Deng's henchmen Lu Xu, Zhang Zipo, and others completely executed his intentions, setting fires and coordinating in the departments related to their work. In addition, they also used liaison officers such as Lu Xu to contact right-wing elements in various democratic parties. For example, during the blooming and contending process, the right-wing general Wu Sigang used his position as a member of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference to viciously attack the Communist Party, saying that "the Communist Party has three styles: arrogance, specialization, and ferocity." He also spread rumors, saying: "That's how the Communist Party is: you are not allowed to talk back when they scold you, you are not allowed to fight back when they hit you, and you are not even allowed to bleed when they kill you." He slandered our Party's United Front Work Department as having six "unifying" work styles: "Unifying the top but not the bottom, unifying the high but not the low, unifying the big but not the small, unifying the few but not the many, unifying the points but not the surface, unifying the near but not the far." Zhu Xie, on the other hand, used his position as a former teacher at Nanjing University and the opportunity of the rectification movement in the Cultural Bureau to ignite two vicious fires before the student riots at Nanjing University.

The participants in this right-wing group not only had problematic backgrounds - there were bureaucrats, politicians, warlords, secretaries, gangsters, scribes, reactionary writers, rascals, and publishers of pornographic books - but several leading members were also anti-communist stalwarts. Deng Haoming, who called himself "having twenty years of democratic history," "three parts anti-communist, seven parts anti-Chiang," and "always being open and aboveboard," was a complete old-brand anti-communist stalwart. As early as 1928 to 1932, he served as a staff member (equivalent to secretary-general) of the Kuomintang Beiping Municipal Party Headquarters and the section chief of the Kuomintang Ping-Sui Railway Party Headquarters. Around the time of the Southern Anhui Incident, he served as the commissioner and security commander of the Sixth Administrative Region of Anhui Province of the Kuomintang, specializing in dealing with the New Fourth Army headquarters stationed in the area. He often went in and out with the commander of the Kuomintang main force, the 25th Division, which created the Southern Anhui Incident. On January 5, 1941, on the eve of the Southern Anhui Incident, Deng Haoming personally presided over a joint party and government meeting of the Sixth District in Zhouwang Village, attended by representatives of the 25th Division, 108th Division, and 52nd Division, as well as puppet county magistrates and Kuomintang secretaries-general. The meeting made sixteen extremely reactionary resolutions, stipulating that each county should establish a "prevention of dissidents" committee, send spies and informants to the garrison of our army to collect information about our army, investigate household registrations, carry out surrender movements, and destroy "heterodox party" organizations. This fully demonstrates that Deng Haoming actively participated in the premeditation of the Southern Anhui Incident. During the Southern Anhui Incident, this anti-communist stalwart also actively sent security teams to participate in the "encirclement and suppression" activities of the New Fourth Army headquarters, implementing a scorched-earth policy, leaving the local people utterly destitute. Deng Haoming also flew between Nanjing and Beiping, actively campaigning for Li Zongren's election as the puppet president. In the anti-rightist struggle, Shi Fangbai, a 76-year-old member of the CPWDP Provincial Committee, gave Deng Haoming a couplet: "Base and despicable, with weapons hidden in your heart; Open and aboveboard, making a show on the surface," completely exposing his lie of "twenty years of democratic history." Wu Sigang, on the other hand, had served as the intelligence director and senior counselor of the Kuomintang Puppet Military Commission, and Tang Enbo's chief of staff, and was an extremely reactionary fellow. Before our army crossed the Yangtze River, Wu Sigang returned to Hunan from Hong Kong to engage in military speculation, collecting soldiers, bandits, and local bullies, organizing the "Hunan People's Revolutionary Army," and appointing himself as the commander-in-chief, attempting to carve up Hunan and divide the world into three parts with the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. The people of western Hunan suffered greatly from his rape, plunder, and were called it the catastrophe of all time.

    江苏搜出一个狼窝——“邓家黑店”
    老板邓昊明原是“皖南事变”的反共凶犯
    本报南京17日电  记者甄为民报道：经过两个月来的反右派斗争，江苏省和南京市的农工民主党组织，在交通部门、医药卫生界和文化新闻界的配合下，揭发出一个以在“皖南事变”中的反共健将、章伯钧—黄琪翔—李伯球集团在江苏的代理人邓昊明为首的右派集团。
    这个右派集团是相当庞大的。在反右派斗争前，他们排斥异己，打击进步，基本上霸占了农工民主党省市领导和许多基层组织的领导权，把农工民主党省市组织变成“邓家黑店”，利用农工民主党作为反共工具。
    据现有揭发的材料，参加这个反动的右派集团的首要分子已将近二十人。在农工民主党省、市领导机关中有：邓昊明（农工民主党中央委员、江苏省和南京市主任委员，省交通厅厅长）、武思光（农工民主党省委委员、省手工业管理局副局长）、朱偰（农工民主党省委委员、省文化局副局长）、陆续（文汇报驻南京记者）、吴调梅（农工民主党南京市委委员兼秘书组长）。在基层组织方面有：洪文佩（省交通、航运二厅农工民主党支部主委）、金诵盘（省卫生厅农工民主党支部负责人）、章子坡（南京药学院农工民主党支部负责人）和汤乃赓（南京房地产局农工民主党支部负责人）。此外，这个集团还在常州、扬州等有农工民主党组织的地方，安上了据点。在大放大鸣之前，邓昊明从农工民主党中央执行局会议回来，在火车上就向同车的交通厅一个工程师宣传：“章伯钧认为部长没当头，还是扩大农工，搞民主党派”。回来后他就到处贩卖章伯钧的“中国要实行两院制”等私货。积极执行了农工民主党中央右派集团的“大发展”的方针，在鸣放过程中，这个右派分子还用心险恶地制造了“共产党对民主人士有两本账，用你时算好账，不用时算坏账”等反动谬论，来煽动群众。还亲自向南京市的一部分农工民主党党员做报告，煽动基层点火。他自己也亲自在省交通厅、航运厅、南京工学院等处点火。
    同时，这个右派集团人事配备也很周到而齐全。有头子，有大将，有核心骨干，有打手，还有联络员。右派头目邓昊明往往通过吴调梅这个追随他二十余年的亲信、骨干核心分子把他的密谋传达给基层，而参加这个右派集团的核心人物、反共大将武思光、朱偰、洪文佩等人和邓的打手陆续、章子坡等人则完全执行他的意图，在和他们工作有关的部门放火策应。此外，他们还通过陆续等联络员与各民主党派右派分子取得联系。例如在鸣放过程中，右派大将武思光利用省政协委员的地位对共产党进行了恶毒的攻击，说什么“共产党有骄、专、凶三风”，他还造谣说：“共产党就是这样：骂你不准回嘴，打你不要回手，杀你还不许流血”。污蔑我党统战部有六统作风：“统上不统下，统高不统低，统大不统小，统寡不统众，统点不统面，统近不统远”。而朱偰又利用曾在南京大学任教的地位和文化局整风的机会，在南大学生上街闹事事件以前放了二把恶毒的火。
    这个右派集团的参加者不仅出身成分很有问题：有官僚、政客、军阀、师爷、青帮、刀笔吏、反动文人、流氓无赖、黄色书刊出版者，而且几个为首分子还是反共健将。邓昊明这个自称为“有二十年民主历史”、“三分反共七分反蒋”、“一向光明磊落”的人物，就是一个十足的老牌反共健将。他早在1928年至1932年就担任了国民党北平市党部干事（相当于书记长）和国民党平绥铁路党部科长。皖南事变前后，他担任国民党安徽第六行政区专员兼保安司令，专门对付驻在该区的皖南新四军军部。他经常和制造皖南事变的国民党主力部队伪二十五师师长同进同出。1941年1月5日，皖南事变前夕，邓昊明亲自主持在周王村召开的有伪二十五师、一百零八师、五十二师代表和各县伪县长、国民党书记长参加的伪六区党政联席会议，会上作了十六项极为反动的决议，规定各县成立“防异”委员会，向我军驻地派出坐探、情报员，搜集我军情况，清查户口，开展自首运动，摧毁“异党”组织等。充分说明了邓昊明积极参与了皖南事变的预谋。皖南事变中这个反共健将还积极派保安队参加了对新四军军部所在地的“清剿”活动，实行坚壁清野，抢得当地人民十室九空。邓昊明还曾坐飞机来往于南京、北平，积极为李宗仁竞选伪总统。在反右派斗争中，七十六岁的农工民主党省委委员施方白送给邓昊明一副对联是：“卑鄙龌龊、内心藏武器；光明磊落，表面做文章”，彻底揭破了他“二十年民主历史”的谎言。而武思光其人，则是历任国民党伪军委会的情报主任、高级参议，汤恩伯的参谋长，是一个极端反动的家伙。在我军渡江前，武思光由香港回湖南搞军事投机，搜罗兵痞土匪、恶霸，组织了“湘西人民革命军”，自任总司令，妄图割据湖南，和共产党、国民党三分天下。湘西人民深受其奸淫、掳掠，称之为有史以来的一次浩劫。
