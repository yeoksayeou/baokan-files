Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Telegram. The Jinan State-owned Textile Company has actively improved its cotton cloth supply work and provided guidance on saving cloth. From January to July of this year, it saved a total of more than 1.48 million feet of cotton cloth, most of which was saved by reducing the amount of public cloth used by various units. In the cotton cloth supply work, the Textile Company changed its previous practice of simply approving applications based on letters from cloth-using units. Instead, they first conducted in-depth investigations to understand the situation and then approved applications based on the actual needs. For example, in March, the Jinan Diesel Engine Factory applied for 15,800 feet of cloth. After the Textile Company investigated, it found that the old work clothes could still be used and there was no need to receive new cloth, so the entire amount of cloth applied for was saved.

    济南纺织品公司七个月节约布一百多万尺
    据新华社济南电　济南市国营纺织品公司积极改进棉布供应工作和指导节约用布，今年1月到7月共节约一百四十八万多尺棉布，其中绝大部分是压缩各单位的公共用布量而节约的。在棉布供应工作中，纺织品公司改变了单纯根据用布单位的函件照批的做法，先深入了解情况，然后据实核批。如济南柴油机厂3月份申请用布一万五千八百尺，经纺织品公司了解，旧的工作服还可继续使用，不需领用新布，所申请的布就全部节约下来。
