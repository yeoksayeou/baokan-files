(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 6th dispatch) Currently, the people of Henan Province's anti-Rightist struggle is deeply expanding to all walks of life. In the past month, the anti-Rightist struggle in the directly subordinate organizations of Henan Province, universities, colleges, and directly subordinate organizations of the prefectural and municipal party committees has achieved great victories and is now developing deeply into all walks of life. From the right-wing backbone elements that have been exposed in various industries in Henan Province, it can be seen that the right-wingers' attacks on the Party are organized and planned. Among the democratic parties, there is Liu Jixue, who has consistently opposed the Communist Party, the people, and socialism; there is Li Jingzhi, an ambitious person who opposes the leadership of the Communist Party; there is Wang Yizhai, who uses double-dealing tactics to frantically attack the Party; Li and Wang "lit fires" everywhere during the blooming, attempting to cut off the Party's ties with the masses. In the education sector, there are Luo Shengwu, a hypocrite with a dignified appearance, and Zhang Jingwu, an insidious and domineering person; the two of them have a common reactionary argument, which is to abolish the Party committee system in schools. In the field of traditional Chinese medicine, there is a small group attacking the Party led by Niu Wutong and with Wang Kunshan as the military advisor. In the press, there is Ren Zhong of the Henan Daily editorial department, who advocated running an anti-socialist "Comrades' Newspaper." In literary and art circles, there are Ma Changfeng and Li Qing, who openly deny that intellectuals need to be reformed. In the scientific and technological community, there is Xiong Shiping, who vainly attempts to abolish the Party's leadership over industrial construction. In the publishing industry, there is Li Wei, who opposes the Party's democratic centralism. In the transportation sector, there are Zhang Zhonglu and Fu Dehua, who have consistently opposed the Soviet Union and admired the United States, and opposed the Party's leadership over the transportation sector. In the business community, there are Wu Zhanggeng and Yu Pinsan, who have consistently opposed the transformation of private industrialists and businessmen. Within the Party and the Communist Youth League, there is Communist Party member Luan Xing, and Communist Youth League member Jiang Zhuolian. Luan Xing openly insulted Marxism-Leninism as "official learning" and falsely accused the dictatorship of the proletariat of being more ferocious than the Qing Dynasty's "literary inquisition." Jiang Zhuolian betrayed the position of the League and colluded with other right-wing elements in the name of the vice chairman of the student union of Henan Agricultural College to frantically attack the Party. In the face of the masses' full reasoning and ironclad facts, some of these right-wing elements have already bowed their heads and confessed their crimes, and some have begun to examine themselves. At the Henan Provincial Party Committee meeting convened on August 4, it was believed that the current movement is expanding more and more widely and deeply to all walks of life, to industrial and mining enterprises, key counties, and primary and secondary school teachers on the basis of victory. This is a new stage in the development of the movement.

    大批右派骨干分子现出了本来面目
    河南反右派斗争向各行业发展
    本报郑州6日电　目前河南省人民反右派斗争正在深入推广到各行各业。一个月以来，河南省直属机关，大专学校和地委市委直属机关，反右派斗争取得了很大胜利，现在正向各行各业深入发展。从河南省各行各业已经揭发出来的右派骨干分子中可以看出右派分子向党进攻是有组织、有计划的。在民主党派中，有一贯反共、反人民、反社会主义的刘积学；有反对共产党领导的野心家李静之；有耍两面派手腕向党猖狂进攻的王毅斋；李、王在鸣放中到处“点火”，企图切断党与群众的联系。在教育界中有道貌岸然的伪君子罗绳武和阴险霸道的张静吾，他们两个共同的反动论点是要在学校中取消党委制。在中医界中有由牛梧青挂帅，王昆山为军师的进攻党的小集团。在新闻界中，有主张办反对社会主义
  “同人报”的河南日报编辑部的任重。在文艺界中，有公然否认知识分子需要改造的马长风和李晴。在科学技术界中，有妄图取消党对工业建设领导的熊世平。在出版界中，有反对党的民主集中制的李蔚。在交通部门中有一贯反苏崇美，反对党对交通部门的领导的张仲鲁、傅德华。在工商界中有一贯反对对私营工商业者进行改造的吴彰耿、禹品三等。在党团中，有共产党员栾星，有共青团员姜卓廉。栾星，公开辱骂马克思列宁主义是“官学”还诬蔑无产阶级专政比清朝的“文字狱”要凶。姜卓廉背叛了团的立场，以河南农学院学生会副主席的名义和其他右派分子勾结起来猖獗地向党进攻。这些右派分子在群众充分的说理和铁的事实面前，有的已经低头认罪，有的开始检讨，8月4日中共河南省委召开的省委全会上，认为当前运动是在胜利基础上愈来愈广泛深入地推广到各行各业，推广到工矿企业、重点县和中小学教师中。这是运动发展的一个新阶段。
