Typical Investigations in Several Agricultural Cooperatives in Hunan Province Prove:
　　It's Terrible Without Unified Purchase and Sales!
　　Tang Yiyong
    Some people say that the unified purchase and sales of grain have ruined things, that the state does not care about the peasants, and that the peasants' living standards have declined. Is this statement in line with the facts? Recently, we made some inquiries in several agricultural cooperatives, and the facts answered us: the unified purchase and sales are well done and correct, and the living standards of the peasants are improving year by year.
    Take Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, for example. In 1954, the county's total output was 368.7 million jin, and the purchase-sale difference (i.e., the actual purchase amount, same below) was 47.88 million jin, with an average grain consumption of 552 jin per person in the county. In 1955, the total output was 425.49 million jin, the purchase-sale difference was 40.46 million jin, and the average was 577 jin per person. In 1956, it suffered a drought, but under the condition of cooperativization, the total output still reached 372.08 million jin, the purchase-sale difference was 27.12 million jin, and the average was 564 jin per person. It can be seen that the output is increasing, while the state's unified purchase task has decreased. In 1955, the "three fixings" were implemented, and it was also a bumper year. The total output increased by 56.79 million jin compared with 1954, but the unified purchase task was the opposite, decreasing by 7.42 million jin compared with 1954. In 1956, due to the disaster, the output decreased slightly compared with 1955, but it still exceeded 1954, and the unified purchase task decreased by 20.76 million jin compared with 1954, and 13.34 million jin compared with 1955. Can it be said that the government does not care about the lives of the peasants?
    Here is a comparison of the grain consumption of some households we learned about over the years:
    In Taiping Cooperative (surplus grain cooperative) of Shaoyang County, six poor peasant households, the average grain consumption per person (25 people) was 493.5 jin in 1953, 529 jin per person (26 people) in 1954, 547 jin per person (29 people) in 1955, and 461 jin 12 liang per person (29 people) in 1956. In Hengchong Cooperative (basically a self-sufficient cooperative), ten peasant households (seven poor peasant households and three middle peasant households), the average per person was 501 jin in 1954, 503 jin in 1955, and 428 jin in 1956. For example, poor peasant Tang Kehan, in 1954, seven people, averaged 426 jin per person; in 1955, eight people, averaged 450 jin per person; in 1956, eight people, averaged 459 jin per person. Middle peasant Tang Mingxi, in 1954, three people, averaged 615 jin per person; in 1955, three people, averaged 636 jin per person; in 1956, three people, averaged 557 jin per person.
    In Xiangxiang Pioneer Cooperative (surplus grain cooperative), 34 households (16 poor peasant households, 3 newly lower-middle peasant households, 2 newly upper-middle peasant households, 9 old lower-middle peasant households, 2 old upper-middle peasant households, and 2 landlord households), the total grain consumption: 90,769 jin in 1953; 91,859 jin in 1954; 100,149 jin in 1955; 100,558 jin in 1956. The grain consumption in 1956 increased by 14,789 jin compared with 1953, an increase of 16.29%.
    The average grain consumption per person in these 34 households over the years: 169 people in 1953, averaging 537 jin per person; 172 people in 1954, averaging 534 jin per person; 172 people in 1955, averaging 582 jin per person; 184 people in 1956, averaging 574 jin per person.
    Average grain consumption per person by class over the years:
    Class　1953　1954　1955　1956
    Poor Peasants　504　501　551　582
    New Lower-Middle Peasants　529　529　552　545
    New Upper-Middle Peasants　573　562　607　544
    Old Lower-Middle Peasants　567　555　607　608
    Old Upper-Middle Peasants　692　680　679　594
    Landlords　443　477　558　539
    It can be seen that since the implementation of unified purchase and sales, the general trend is that the grain consumption of peasants has increased year by year, especially for poor peasants (followed by new and old lower-middle peasants), the increase has been even more significant after cooperativization. However, due to the different conditions in various places and the amount of labor people put into agricultural cooperatives, there are also curves that rise. 1955 was a bumper year, with a large increase, and 1956 saw a decrease in production, so it declined somewhat. This is also very natural. Different population growth situations also affect the speed of improvement in living standards. The broad masses of peasants have a deep understanding of these benefits. For example, Tang Mingdu, a poor peasant member of Hengchong Cooperative, said: "Before the unified purchase and sales, I was short of grain for five months a year, and I relied on carrying burdens to earn some money to buy grain; speculative grain merchants raised prices indiscriminately, it was really miserable, it was common to not see rice for three or five days. After the unified purchase and sales, the government sold me seven or eight hundred jin of grain a year, and I ate evenly every year, without suffering any hunger. Last year we suffered such a big drought, if it weren't for the unified purchase and sales and cooperativization, wouldn't two of my family of seven have starved to death? How could we still have eaten 443 jin of grain per person?" Li Dutung, a poor peasant member of Taiping Cooperative in Xiangxiang County, told me: In 1953, his family of six ate an average of 442 jin, in 1954 they ate 508 jin, in 1955, five people, they ate an average of 560 jin, and in 1956 they ate 408 jin. He said that in the past few years, it had been rising year by year and life was good, but last year's drought made it tighter, but this was grain transported from other places by the government, and eating this much was still okay.
    However, why do some peasants suffer from grain shortages every spring and summer? The result of our discussions with the cooperative cadres and members of these cooperatives is: in addition to some unavoidable or avoidable shortcomings in our work (such as some yields not being accurately investigated, being too high or too low; some ration standards being a little low; egalitarianism in distribution; insufficient ideological education, some masses concealing production, affecting the reasonable distribution of tasks; during the unified purchase and sales, it is impossible for the calculated yield of planted but unharvested and unplanted and unharvested portions to match the actual harvested yield, so that a few households need to make up for sales after the unified purchase and sales, etc.), the main reason is that peasants do not implement planned grain consumption and lack a sense of thrift. Many people blindly believe that "we have entered socialism" and demand improvements in life too quickly and too highly. There are also a considerable number of households who, because they see others making up for sales, develop egalitarian ideas and also shout about grain shortages. In particular, a small number of wealthy middle peasants are dissatisfied with socialism, so they take this opportunity to clamor and instigate the masses to create grain shortages. The township and cooperative cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside after cooperativization, their sense of struggle is weak, and they have broadened the scope of supplementary sales and practiced egalitarianism in distribution, leading to passivity in their work. According to Xiangxiang County's inspection, among the 28,152 households short of grain this spring, 13,053 households were short of grain because they did not implement planned grain consumption (accounting for 46.36% of the households short of grain), and 9,138 households were short of grain because they brewed wine, boiled sugar, entertained guests, and used too much staple food to feed pigs (accounting for 32.4%), only 3,930 households were short of grain due to loopholes in work, low ration standards, or missed sales (accounting for 13.9%), and only 2,031 households were short of grain due to natural disasters, reduced autumn miscellaneous crops, or population increases (accounting for 7.2%). The statistics of Xiangxiang Xingxing Cooperative prove that the actual grain consumption in recent years has generally been 490 jin to 530 jin. In 1954, due to poor planning and saving of grain, 184 households made up for sales (accounting for 80% of the total number of households), of which only 42 households actually needed to make up for sales because they had large families and not enough grain. In 1956, because the agricultural cooperative took measures to implement planned grain consumption, not a single household has made up for sales until now, the lives of the members are normal, the labor attendance rate has increased by 30% compared with last year, and production is better than in any previous year. Therefore, everyone unanimously believes that the important issue is to earnestly implement the planned grain consumption and saving grain. Wang Yongzhi, a new upper-middle peasant in Pioneer Cooperative, a family of three, ate an average of 480 jin per person in 1953. Last year, he was allocated 706 jin per person in the cooperative, ate and used it indiscriminately, and has wasted 300 jin of grain by brewing wine since the autumn harvest. Since spring and summer, he has often shouted about grain shortages, saying that 1,000 jin of grain per person is enough. The masses have a lot of opinions about him. Poor peasant Li Dayang criticized him like this: "Wang Yongzhi, you have really forgotten the past, don't you think about how much you used to eat? How much has our cooperative increased production? The increase in production is not even enough for you to eat, and you brew wine and drink it lavishly after you get the grain."
    How much grain does a peasant need to eat a year? There is a customary saying in Shaoyang that "seven stones are tight and eight stones are loose," which means that a full labor force is still a little tight with seven dan of grain a year, and eight dan of grain is loose. We discussed this statement with the cadres and masses of these cooperatives and believe that there have been such situations in the past. However, this is not what the peasants are demanding. The peasants can easily accept the principle that the grain ration standard must be determined based on the current production level, the cooperative's grain production situation, and be in line with the state's purchase and sales plan, taking into account historical habits and living standards. In the past, only a very small number of wealthy households used seven or eight dan of grain a year, and it was not entirely for eating, but also included eating other things and buying other things. As for the broad masses of peasants, they suffered from hunger or could not eat staple food for three to five months every year. Due to the unified purchase and sales, especially cooperativization, the grain distribution has become balanced and increasingly reasonable, which is in the interests of the broad masses of peasants, so what's wrong with that? Moreover, this balance is not an absolute egalitarian "average." In agricultural cooperatives, households with more labor and strong labor forces who eat more grain are also given some consideration, and in the future, the implementation of fixed quotas per person will distribute grain more rationally. Therefore, the level of grain consumption between households still varies, with highs and lows, while meeting basic rations. In 1956, it was not uncommon for the average grain consumption to be 600 to 700 jin. For example, in Hengchong Cooperative in Shaoyang, the average grain consumption per person in the whole cooperative last year was 457 jin, of which 23 households (accounting for 12% of the total number of households) had an average grain consumption of 620 jin to 700 jin, and half of these households were middle peasants.
    Facts have proven that under the current production level, the grain consumption level in the past few years has been appropriate, and the relationship between the state and the peasants is normal. As long as we correctly adopt the method of grading and fixing quantities, we can distribute grain more rationally, and there is enough grain to use.

　　在湖南省几个农业社所作的典型调查证明：
　　没有统购统销不得了！
　　唐一庸
    有的人说粮食统购统销搞坏了，国家不关心农民，农民生活降低了。这种说法符合事实吗？最近我们到几个农业社里作了一些了解，事实给我们的回答是：统购统销搞得好，搞对了，农民的生活水平在逐年提高。
    拿湖南湘乡县来说，1954年全县总产量为三亿六千八百七十万斤，购销差（即实购数，下同）四千七百八十八万斤，全县每人平均用粮五百五十二斤；1955年总产量四亿二千五百四十九万斤，购销差为四千零四十六万斤，每人平均五百七十七斤；1956年受了旱灾，但在合作化的情况下，总产量仍达三亿七千二百零八万斤，购销差二千七百一十二万斤，每人平均五百六十四斤。可见产量在增加，而国家统购任务还减少了。1955年实行了“三定”，又是丰收年，总产量比1954年增加五千六百七十九万斤，而统购任务却相反，比1954年减少七百四十二万斤。1956年因灾比1955年减了点产，但仍超过1954年，而统购任务比1954年减少二千零七十六万斤，比1955年减少一千三百三十四万斤。难道说，这是政府不关心农民生活吗？
    我们了解的一些农户几年来用粮情况的比较是这样：
    邵阳县太平社（余粮社）六户贫农，1953年每人（二十五人）平均用粮四百九十三斤半，1954年每人（二十六人）平均五百二十九斤，1955年每人（二十九人）平均五百四十七斤，1956年每人（二十九人）平均四百六十一斤十二两。横冲社（基本上是自足社），十户农民（七户贫农三户中农），1954年每人平均五百零一斤，1955年每人平均五百零三斤，1956年每人平均四百二十八斤。如贫农唐克汗，1954年，七口人，每人平均四百二十六斤；1955年，八口人，每人平均四百五十斤；1956年，八口人，每人平均四百五十九斤。中农唐名细，1954年，三口人，每人平均六百一十五斤；1955年，三口人，每人平均六百三十六斤；1956年，三口人，每人平均五百五十七斤。
    湘乡先锋社（余粮社）三十四户（贫农十六户，新下中农三户，新上中农二户，老下中农九户，老上中农二户，地主二户），总的用粮：1953年九万零七百六十九斤；1954年九万一千八百五十九斤；1955年十万零一百四十九斤；1956年十万零五千五百五十八斤。1956年比1953年用粮增加一万四千七百八十九斤，增加16.29％。
    这三十四户几年来每人平均用粮数：1953年一百六十九人，每人平均五百三十七斤；1954年，一百七十二人，每人平均五百三十四斤；1955年，一百七十二人，每人平均五百八十二斤；1956年，一百八十四人，每人平均五百七十四斤。
    分阶层各年每人平均用粮数：
    阶层　1953年　1954年　1955年　1956年
    贫农　504　501　551　582
    新下中农　529　529　552　545
    新上中农　573　562　607　544
    老下中农　567　555　607　608
    老上中农　692　680　679　594
    地主　443　477　558　539
    由此可见，实行统购统销以来，总的趋势是，农民用粮是逐年增加，特别是贫农（其次是新老下中农）在合作化以后增加的更为显著。但由于各地年景好坏不一样，人们在农业社劳动有多少，因此也有曲线上升的。1955年丰收，增加的多，1956年减了产，又下降了一些。这也是很自然的。由于人口增长的情况不同，也影响着生活水平提高的快慢。广大农民对这些好处体会是很深切的。如横冲社贫农社员唐名度说：“统购统销以前，我一年要缺五个月粮，就靠挑点担子弄几个钱买粮；投机粮商滥涨价，真是苦死人，三、五天没见米是常事。统购统销以后，政府一年销给我七八百斤粮，年年吃得匀了，没有受一点饿。去年遭了这么大的旱灾，要不是统购统销和合作化，我一家七口人，能不饿死两个？那还能每人吃到四百四十三斤粮？湘乡县太平社贫农社员黎笃汤告诉我：1953年他六口人，平均吃四百四十二斤，1954年吃五百零八斤，1955年，五口人，平均吃五百六十斤，1956年吃四百零八斤。他说，前几年逐年上升好过得很，只去年受旱灾就紧了一些，但这是政府从外地运来的粮，吃这么多也过得去了。
    但是，为什么部分农民每年春、夏闹粮呢？我们和这几个社的社干、社员座谈的结果是：除了我们工作上一些可以避免或不可避免的缺点（如有的产量查得不实，偏高偏低；有的口粮标准低了一点；分配上的平均主义；思想教育不够，部分群众瞒产，影响了任务的合理分配；统购统销时，计算已种未收和未种未收部分的产量不可能与实际收获时产量相符，使少数户在统购统销以后，需要补销，等等）以外，主要是由于农民中不实行计划用粮，缺乏节约思想。许多人盲目地认为“进到社会主义了”，生活的改善要求过急过高。还有相当一部分户，由于见别人补销了而产生平均主义思想，也跟着叫喊缺粮。特别是少数富裕中农，他们对社会主义不满，便趁此大肆叫嚣，煽动群众闹粮。乡社干部对于合作化后农村这种资本主义自发势力认识不够，斗争观念淡薄了，以致补销面过宽、分配平均主义，招致了工作上的被动。据湘乡全县检查，今年春季缺粮的二万八千一百五十二户中，因为不执行计划用粮而缺粮的有一万三千零五十三户
  （占缺粮户46.36％），因为煮酒、熬糖、请客以及过多的拿主粮喂猪而缺粮的有九千一百三十八户（占32.4％），因工作有漏洞，口粮标准低了，或漏销而缺粮的只三千九百三十户（占13.9％），因自然灾害，秋杂作物减产或人口增加而缺粮的只二千零三十一户
  （占7.2％）。湘乡星星社的统计情况证明，几年来实际用粮一般是四百九十斤到五百三十斤，1954年由于计划用粮、节约用粮做得差，补销一百八十四户（占总户数80％），其中真正因为大口多粮食不够，需要补销的只四十二户。1956年，由于农业社采取了措施，实行计划用粮，一直到现在没有一户补销的，社员生活正常，劳动出工率比去年提高30％，生产比往年任何一年搞得好。因此，大家一致认为，重要的问题是切实贯彻执行计划用粮、节约用粮问题。先锋社新上中农王咏芝，三口人，1953年每人平均吃四百八十斤，去年在合作社里每人分七百零六斤，乱吃乱用，秋收以来，先后煮酒浪费三百斤粮食，春夏以来，经常叫缺粮，说要一千斤粮一个人才够了。群众对他意见很大。贫农李达阳是这样批评他的：“王咏芝，你硬是忘记过去了，你不想想以前吃多少？我们社里到底增了多少产？增产的还没有你吃的多，分得粮食了就大煮酒喝。”
    到底一个农民一年要吃多少粮食才够了呢？邵阳有个习惯的说法是“七紧八松”，即是说一个整劳动力一年七石谷还紧了一点，八石谷就松了。这个说法，我们和这几个社的干部、群众研究了一下，认为过去也有过这样的情况。但是农民并不是这样要求的，农民对于口粮标准必须根据当前生产水平，本社的产粮情况，与国家购销计划相符，照顾历史习惯生活水平等三个方面的情况来确定的道理是容易接受的。过去一年用七石、八石谷的只是很少数的富裕户，并且不完全是吃饱，而是包括吃别的、买别的东西。至于广大农民，则每年有三至五个月要受饿或吃不上主粮。由于统购统销特别是合作化，使粮食分配平衡了，日趋合理了，这是广大农民的利益，又有什么不好呢？而且这种平衡并不是绝对平均主义的“平均”，在农业社里多劳动的和大口多的劳动力强的多吃粮的户也作了些照顾，并且今后将实行以人定量会把粮食分配得更合理。因此，户与户之间的用粮水平在满足基本口粮的情况下，仍是有高低的。1956年平均用粮在六七百斤的也不少见。如邵阳横冲社，去年全社每人平均四百五十七斤，其中平均用粮在六百二十斤到七百斤的就有二十三户（占总户数12％），而这些户里面有半数户是中农。
    事实证明，在现有生产水平的情况下，以往几年的用粮水平是适当的，国家同农民的关系是正常的。只要正确采取分等定量的办法，可以把粮食分配得更合理，粮食是够用的。
