Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, August 22nd: Yang Ziheng, the agent of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in Gansu Province and Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, has for several years been vigorously developing members in Gansu Province by adopting a "come one, come all" policy, in accordance with the instructions of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. He has been particularly active in developing members among young students and plans to expand the scope of member development to rural areas.

Yang Ziheng sent his confidants to actively recruit young students into the League in universities and middle schools in Lanzhou, Pingliang and other places. Of the sixty-four students who graduated from Pingliang Normal School in 1950, more than thirty were registered as members. They filled in the time of these students' joining the League as 1948 and deceived the students by saying: "In the future, the head of the county will be a Party member, and the deputy head of the county will be a League member." In 1952, more than two thousand teachers participated in the Gansu Provincial Secondary School Teachers' Study Conference. Yang Ziheng planned to recruit one-third of these teachers into the League. As a result, only nearly two hundred people were developed, and he was very dissatisfied, losing his temper with the relevant personnel in the League and criticizing them for being "closed-doorists."

After the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward, Yang Ziheng's ambition became even greater. He resolutely supported Luo Longji's statement that "the Democratic League has no work to do if it does not develop backward elements," actively conveyed it to the members of the Democratic League, and advocated that all those who cannot join the Communist Party should be absorbed into the League. In order to win people over to join the Democratic League, he even distorted the eight conditions for Communist Party membership, saying: "To join the Party, you must meet eight conditions. Even if you meet seven or seven and a half, it's not enough. If you can't join the Party, you can join the League first." He advocated that all intellectuals can be absorbed into the League, advocating "vigorous development" among young people, especially fourth-year university students, on the grounds that these students can be assigned as cadres of the Democratic League after graduation. He also wanted to vigorously develop in rural areas, saying that in the future, the people at the tractor stations should all be developed into members of the Democratic League.

Due to Yang Ziheng's "come one, come all" policy of vigorous development, the members of the Gansu Provincial Organization of the Democratic League are extremely impure. According to statistics, among the four hundred and sixty-eight new members recently absorbed by the Gansu Provincial Organization of the Democratic League, there are ninety-three reactionary party and league backbone elements, thirty-one who participated in Kuomintang secret service organizations, and three who have been criminally punished since liberation.

    按照章罗联盟指示大肆发展盟员
　　杨子恒极力搜罗反动骨干分子
    新华社兰州22日电　章罗联盟在甘肃省的代理人——民盟甘肃省委主任委员杨子恒，几年来一直按照章罗联盟的指示，在甘肃省采取“来者不拒”的方针大肆发展盟员。他特别积极地在青年学生中发展盟员，并计划把发展盟员的范围扩大到农村中去。
    杨子恒派他的亲信在兰州、平凉等地大、中学校中积极拉拢青年学生入盟。1950年平凉师范毕业的六十四名学生中，就有三十多人被登记为盟员。他们把这批学生的入盟时间都填成1948年，并且欺骗学生说：“将来正县长是党员，副县长就是盟员”。1952年，有两千多名教师参加甘肃省中等教师学习会，杨子恒计划从这批教师中吸收三分之一的人入盟。结果只发展了近二百人，他就大为不满，向盟内的有关人员大发雷霆，批评他们是“关门主义”。
    当“长期共存、互相监督”的方针提出以后，杨子恒的野心更大了。他坚决支持罗隆基的“民盟不发展落后分子就没有工作可作”的说法，积极向民盟成员们传达，主张把不能参加共产党的人全部吸收入盟。他为了拉拢人参加民盟，甚至歪曲共产党员的八个条件说：“入党必须具备八个条件，具备了七个甚至七个半都不成，入不了党，可先入盟。”他主张凡是知识分子都可以吸收入盟，主张在青年人特别是大学四年级的学生中“大发展”，理由是在这些学生毕业后，可配备为民盟的干部。他还要在农村中大发展，并说将来要把拖拉机站的人都发展为民盟盟员。
    由于杨子恒采取“来者不拒”的大发展方针，使民盟甘肃省组织的成员极为不纯。据统计，民盟甘肃省组织新近吸收的四百六十八个新盟员中，就有反动党团骨干分子九十三人，参加过国民党特务组织的三十一人，解放后受过刑事处分的三人。
