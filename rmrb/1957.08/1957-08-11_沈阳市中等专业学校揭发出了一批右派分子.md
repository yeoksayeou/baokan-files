Xinhua News Agency dispatch. Shenyang City's various secondary specialized schools have exposed a group of rightists. Liu Qingyuan, a teacher at the Shenyang Coal Mine Workers School and a rightist, proclaimed everywhere that he agreed with Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world." He once conspired with Zhang Baisheng, a rightist from Shenyang Normal College, to support Zhang Baisheng's attack on the Party. Li Jinghe, a rightist from the Shenyang Nonferrous Metals Industry School, convened a secret meeting of some rightists on the night of June 8th and formulated eleven reactionary programs. The programs arrogantly stipulated: "Replace the chairman of the trade union and the editor of the school newspaper (both are Communist Party members)," "Organize a 'blooming and contending' office by the masses," and so on.

Wang Lin, a political instructor at the Liaoning Provincial Accelerated Teacher Training College, incited and roped in some teachers and students during the blooming and contending period, attempting to engage in "great democracy."

As the vigorous anti-rightist struggle in Shenyang's secondary specialized schools is gradually deepening, the rightists have fallen into isolation.

    沈阳市中等专业学校揭发出了一批右派分子
    新华社专稿　沈阳市各中等专业学校揭发出了一批右派分子。沈阳煤矿工人学校教员、右派分子刘庆元到处宣称他同意储安平“党天下”的谬论，他曾经和沈阳师范学院右派分子张百生密谋，支持张百生向党进攻。沈阳有色金属工业学校右派分子李敬和在6月8日夜间，召集一些右派分子开秘密会议，制订了十一条反动纲领。纲领狂妄规定：“撤换工会主席和校刊编辑（都是共产党员）”、“由群众组织鸣放办公室”等等。
    辽宁省速成师范专科学校政治教员王琳在鸣放期间，煽动和拉拢部分师生，企图搞“大民主”。
    由于声势浩大的沈阳市中等专业学校反右派斗争正在逐渐深入，右派分子已陷于孤立。
