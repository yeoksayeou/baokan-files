    Seeking New Knowledge and Building a New Countryside
    120,000 Farmers in Henan Province Participate in Spare-Time Middle School Studies

    (Our Dispatch) Many farmers' spare-time middle schools have been established in the vast rural areas of Henan Province. According to incomplete statistics, more than 120,000 students are participating in these programs.

    Farmers' spare-time middle schools are set up by agricultural cooperatives or by the masses collectively. 80% of the students are graduates of junior high schools and senior elementary schools, and a small number are graduates of farmers' spare-time elementary schools. The purpose of running these middle schools is to meet the learning needs of middle and elementary school graduates who have not been able to continue their education, to further improve their cultural and scientific knowledge, and to better serve agricultural production. Agricultural cooperative cadres and the broad masses of farmers are very enthusiastic about running these schools and provide assistance in various ways.

    There are two types of spare-time middle schools in terms of form: one is attached to ordinary middle schools and complete elementary schools, with ordinary middle school teachers teaching part-time. The other is independently established schools, which is the more common form. Teachers are hired from local intellectuals in the countryside and graduates of junior and senior high schools. Many spare-time middle schools pay attention to combining classroom teaching with practical operation outside of class. For example, the Xin Dian Spare-Time Middle School in Xinzheng, the agricultural cooperative allocated several acres of land for the spare-time middle school to conduct agricultural experiments. They conducted a series of operational experiments on these lands, such as seed soaking and close planting. In order to closely integrate learning with production needs, the spare-time middle schools in Changge and Dengxian also invite cadres from agricultural technology guidance stations to teach production technology courses according to the production season. The study time is two to three hours in the morning and evening.

    Because spare-time middle schools are mostly run by townships and cooperatives, and students study in their spare time, they can persist in production and study culture, which is welcomed by the masses and students. Many middle and elementary school graduates have improved their cultural level after participating in spare-time middle school studies. They feel that they can still persist in learning while producing in the countryside, so they are more content to produce in the countryside. (Report)

    寻求新知识　建设新农村
    河南省十二万农民参加业余中学学习
    本报讯　河南省广大农村办了许多农民业余中学。据不完全的统计，参加农民业余中学学习的学员已达十二万多人。
    农民业余中学是由农业社或群众集体办起来的。80％的学员是初中、高小毕业生，少部分是农民业余小学毕业的学员。办农民业余中学的目的是为了满足未能升学的中、小学毕业生的学习要求，继续提高他们的文化科学知识，更好地为农业生产服务。农业社干部和广大农民群众对举办农民业余中学的积极性很高，在各方面给以帮助。
    业余中学在形式上有二种：一种是附设在普通中学和完小里，聘请普通中学教师兼课。一种是单独设校，这种形式比较多。教师是聘请当地在乡知识分子、初、高中毕业学生。不少业余中学注意把课堂教学与课外实际操作结合起来，像新郑辛店业余中学、农业社拨出几亩地来供业余中学进行农业试验，他们在这些地上进行浸种，密植等一系列的操作试验。为了使学习密切结合生产需要，长葛、邓县的业余中学，还根据生产季节请农业技术指导站的干部讲生产技术课。学习的时间是在早晨、晚上二至三个小时。
    业余中学由于多是以乡、社举办的，并且在业余时间学习，学员能够坚持生产，学习文化，受到了群众和学员的欢迎。许多中小学毕业生参加业余中学学习后，文化水平有了提高。他们感到在农村生产，还能同样坚持学习，因此更安心在农村生产。　（记实）
