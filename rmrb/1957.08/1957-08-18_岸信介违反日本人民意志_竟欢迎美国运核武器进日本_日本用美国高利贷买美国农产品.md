Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 17th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi said publicly in the Diet on August 16th that, according to the provisions of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the United States can transport nuclear weapons into Japan without consulting the Japanese government.

Kishi Nobusuke said that the Japan-U.S. sides will discuss the issue of transporting nuclear weapons into Japan at the meeting to be held by the newly established "Japan-U.S. Security Committee." He also said that Japan may request U.S. assistance and cooperation when deciding on its "defense plan." He believes that Japan needs U.S. protection.

On the same day, about 4,000 representatives from all over Japan who attended the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament passed a resolution on promoting the anti-nuclear weapons movement in Japan, opposing the U.S. transporting nuclear weapons into Japan and turning Japan into a base for atomic warfare, demanding the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and opposing the promotion of an atomic war system.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 17th: The agreement for Japan to borrow 115 million U.S. dollars from the U.S. Export-Import Bank was signed by both parties in Washington today.

This loan is part of a total loan of 175 million U.S. dollars that the U.S. Export-Import Bank has decided to lend to Japan. Japan will use this loan to purchase surplus American agricultural products.

According to the agreement, Japan must repay the 115 million U.S. dollar loan within nine months and pay an annual interest rate of 4.5%. The agreement also stipulates that not all of the surplus American agricultural products purchased by Japan with this loan can be transported by Japanese ships, but 50% must be transported by American ships.

The Japanese government decided yesterday to purchase surplus American agricultural products this year. Ichiro Kono, Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency, said yesterday that he plans to go to Washington in October to negotiate with the U.S. government on the issue of purchasing American agricultural products.

    岸信介违反日本人民意志
    竟欢迎美国运核武器进日本
    日本用美国高利贷买美国农产品
    据新华社17日讯  东京消息：日本首相岸信介8月16日在国会里公然说，根据日美“安全条约”的规定，美国可以在没有同日本政府磋商的情况下把核武器运入日本。
    岸信介说，在新设立的“日美安全委员会”将要举行的会议上，日美双方将讨论把核武器运进日本的问题。他还说，日本在决定它的“防卫计划”时可能要求美国的援助和合作。他认为日本需要美国的保护。
    就在同一天，出席第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的日本各地代表约四千人，通过了关于推进日本国内禁止核武器运动的决议，反对美国把核武器运进日本境内和把日本变成原子战争基地，要求废除日美“安全条约”，反对推行原子战争体制。
    据新华社17日讯  东京消息：日本向美国进出口银行借款一亿一千五百万美元的协定，今天已经由双方在华盛顿签字。
    这笔贷款是美国进出口银行决定贷给日本的总数一亿七千五百万美元的贷款的一部分。日本将用这笔贷款购买美国的剩余农产品。
    根据协定，日本在九个月内就要还清这笔一亿一千五百万美元的借款，并且要付年利四分五厘。协定还规定，日本用这笔借款购买的美国剩余农产品不能全部由日本船只运送，而必须由美国船只运送50％。
    日本政府在昨天已经决定要在今年购买美国的剩余农产品。经济企划厅长官河野一郎昨天说，他准备在10月份到华盛顿，同美国政府谈判购买美国农产品问题。
