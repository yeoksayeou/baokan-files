Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 20th - Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar said on the 19th that since the United States announced the Eisenhower Doctrine, Syria has been the target of destructive activities carried out by the United States in order to force Syria to accept this doctrine.

Bitar stated at a press conference that the main purpose of the conspiracy to overthrow the Syrian government was to change the country's free foreign policy and establish a government that colludes with imperialism. He said that the United States had attempted to undermine Syria's independence by instigating conspiracies and economic blockades.

Bitar said that no country should interfere in the internal affairs of another country, as stipulated by the United Nations Charter, but the actions of American diplomats were precisely in violation of this principle. He said that this conspiracy case reveals naked facts and methods that are incompatible with the principles of international law and completely violate diplomatic conventions.

In response to a question about whether the Syrian government intends to sever diplomatic relations with the United States, Bitar said, "This question depends on the steps the United States intends to take." He said in response to another question that Syria might "explain the dangerous American anti-Syrian conspiracy on the international stage."

Bitar reiterated that Syria will adhere to a foreign policy based on "non-alignment and active neutrality." He denounced Western newspapers' reports of a so-called pro-Soviet coup in Syria as imperialist propaganda. He pointed out that former Chief of Staff of the Army Nizam al-Din retired at his own request, and the recent dismissal of a group of officers was based on the interests of the country.

Bitar said: "The most serious anti-Arab action of the United States is the Eisenhower Doctrine, whose main goal is to sow discord among Arab countries, eliminate independence, and encourage reactionary movements." He pointed out that due to the United States' promotion of the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, divisions and discord have emerged among certain Arab countries. Those countries that have accepted the Eisenhower Doctrine have lost the freedom to handle their own internal affairs and have become bases for American conspiracies against Syria and Egypt. With the support of the United States, the reactionaries in these countries, under the pretext of opposing communism, have been persecuting patriotic nationalists, thereby intensifying terrorist activities in these countries.

Bitar accused Western propaganda agencies of fabricating various false reports about Syria. He said that imperialist countries have established propaganda machinery in Beirut to provide distorted news to certain Lebanese newspapers so that news agencies can spread these messages around the world, making people believe that these reports are spontaneously reported by Arab newspapers.

In response to a question about Italy's mediation of relations between Syria and the United States, Bitar said that during his last visit to Italy, he told the Italian Prime Minister that if Italy could be self-reliant and not rely on imperialism, then it could become a positive factor for both the Arabs and the West.

On the same day, Syrian Education Minister Sibai said that the Syrian "situation is completely normal, and some recent measures were taken as a result of the discovery of an American conspiracy." He said:

"It is absolutely untrue that the government is considering seizing certain newspapers or dismissing certain senior officials."

    叙外长重申坚持积极中立政策
　　指责美国阴谋破坏叙利亚独立
    某些阿拉伯国家的不和咎在艾森豪威尔主义
    新华社大马士革20日电　叙利亚外交部长比塔尔19日说，自从美国宣布了艾森豪威尔主义以来，叙利亚一直成为美国为了强使叙利亚接受这种主义而进行的破坏性活动的目标。
    比塔尔在记者招待会上说，阴谋推翻叙利亚政府的主要目的在于改变这个国家的自由的外交政策，建立同帝国主义同流合污的政府。他说，美国曾经企图用策动阴谋和经济封锁的手段来破坏叙利亚的独立。
    比塔尔说，任何国家都不得干涉别国的内政，这是联合国宪章所规定的，但是美国外交人员的所作所为恰好违背了这种原则。他说，这次阴谋案显示了同国际法原则不相容的并且完全违反外交惯例的赤裸裸的事实和手法。
    在回答关于叙利亚政府是否打算同美国断绝外交关系的问题的时候，比塔尔说：“这个问题取决于美国打算采取的步骤。”他回答另一个问题时说，叙利亚可能“在国际讲坛上解释危险的美国反叙利亚阴谋”。
    比塔尔重申，叙利亚将坚持奉行以“不参加集团和积极中立”为基础的外交政策。他斥责西方报纸关于叙利亚发生了所谓亲苏的政变的消息是帝国主义宣传。他指出，前陆军参谋长尼扎姆丁是根据他自己的要求退休的，最近一批军官被解职是根据国家的利益。
    比塔尔说：“美国最严重的反阿拉伯的行动是艾森豪威尔主义，它的主要目标是在阿拉伯国家中间散播不和，取消独立，鼓励反动的运动。”他指出，由于美国在中东推行艾森豪威尔主义，某些阿拉伯国家之间出现了分裂和不和。接受艾森豪威尔主义的那些国家丧失了处理它们自己内政的自由，变成了美国策划反对叙利亚和埃及的阴谋的基地，这些国家的反动派在美国的支持下，以反对共产主义为借口，已经在迫害爱国的民族主义分子，从而使得这些国家的恐怖活动猖獗。
    比塔尔指责西方宣传机构捏造关于叙利亚的各种虚假消息。他说，帝国主义国家已经在贝鲁特建立宣传机器，以便把歪曲事实的新闻供给黎巴嫩的某些报纸，这样，各通讯社会把这些消息传布到全世界，使人以为这些消息好像是阿拉伯报纸所自发报道的。
    在回答关于由意大利来调停叙利亚同美国的关系问题时，比塔尔说，在他上次访问意大利期间，他曾经对意大利总理说，如果意大利能够自立而不要依靠帝国主义，那么它对阿拉伯人和对西方都可以成为一个积极的因素。
    同一天，叙利亚教育部长西巴伊说，叙利亚“局势完全正常，最近采取的一些措施是由于发现美国的阴谋而采取的”。他说：
  “有人说政府考虑查封某些报纸或是某些高级官员撤职，这是绝对不真实的。”
