Small Factories Accomplish Big Things

　　100,000 compared to 1,300,000

　　The Chongqing Changjiang Chemical Factory, with only forty-six employees, had a total investment of just 100,000 yuan, but this year it can produce 1,300,000 yuan worth of products for the country.

　　This factory can produce twelve times its equipment investment this year, mainly due to the creative labor of its employees. The main new product produced in large quantities this year, cubeb oil, was developed in the fourth quarter of last year by the employees through repeated experiments using the seeds of a wild plant called cubeb, which grows abundantly in the mountainous areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and the Emei Mountains in Sichuan. It is an important oil for the manufacture of high-grade fragrances. This year, when producing cubeb oil, the factory employees, in response to difficulties such as remote raw material origins, transportation difficulties, and high freight costs, pioneered a special production method: moving the oil refining workshop to the raw material production area. The employees also designed and manufactured twenty sets of very simple, lightweight, and easy-to-carry cubeb oil steaming pots, each costing just over 1,000 yuan. In this way, this "mobile oil refining workshop" with more than ten employees can produce more than 70,000 yuan worth of cubeb oil this year and save more than 270,000 yuan in raw material transportation costs.

　　This year, the employees also improved the operation method of stearic acid, increasing the output by more than four times compared to last year without increasing equipment or manpower.

　　Completely Utilizing Waste for Production

　　The Chongqing Dropped Cotton Processing Factory is currently the only factory in China that completely utilizes waste from cotton mills—dropped cotton—for production. Dropped cotton is unusable waste left over after spinning in textile factories. The factory workers specialize in collecting dropped cotton from many textile factories in East China, Central South China, and Sichuan, and then processing it through machines to become clean, white, net dropped cotton. This net dropped cotton can replace good cotton for use in plastics and other factories, saving good cotton for the country.

　　The factory's total construction investment was only 170,000 yuan, and the production value this year reached more than 1,000,000 yuan. The profits turned over by the factory from January to July this year alone amounted to 200,000 yuan, exceeding the total equipment investment of the entire factory.

　　Machine Factory That Produces No Defective Products

　　Since liberation, the Chongqing Huigong Machine Factory has never produced defective products when repairing or manufacturing complete sets of machines.

　　Because the factory's employees pay special attention to improving quality, many large factories are eager to ask them to repair machine tools, and the repair business is overwhelming. According to the factory's production capacity, it can repair a maximum of one hundred machine tools per year, but currently, there are more than one hundred units planning to send a total of one hundred and seventy-one machine tools for repair. The factory can also manufacture more than forty high-precision machine tools each year.

### 小工厂办大事

    小工厂办大事
    10万比130万
    只有四十六个职工的重庆长江化工厂，全部投资不过十万元，可是今年却能为国家生产一百三十万元的产品。
    这个厂今年能生产比设备投资大十二倍的产品，主要是职工们发挥了创造性的劳动。厂里今年大量生产的主要新产品澄茄油，是去年四季度职工们用云南、贵州、四川峨嵋等地山区盛产的一种野生植物澄茄籽，经过多次试验研究提炼出来的。它是一种制造高级香料的重要油料。今年厂里职工在生产澄茄油时，针对原料产地远、运输困难、运费大等困难，首创了一种特殊的生产办法：把炼油车间搬到原料产地去生产。职工们还自己设计制成了二十套非常简单轻便、容易携带的生产澄茄油的蒸锅，每套设备不过一千多元。这样，这个“活动炼油车间”十多名职工今年便能生产出价值七千多万元的澄茄油，并节约原料运输费二十七万多元。
    职工们今年还改进了硬脂酸的操作方法，在不增加设备和人力的情况下，使产量比去年提高四倍多。
      完全利用废物生产
    重庆落棉加工厂是我国目前唯一的完全利用棉纺厂的废物——落棉进行生产的工厂。落棉是纺织工厂纺纱后剩下的无法利用的废物。这个厂的工人，专门收集华东、中南和四川的许多纺织厂的落棉，然后通过机器处理使之成为洁白的净落棉；净落棉可以代替好棉供给塑料等厂应用，为国家节约好棉。
    这个厂的全部建设投资只有一十七万元，今年的生产价值达一百多万元。这个厂今年一至七月份已上缴的利润就有二十万元，超过了全厂的全部设备投资。
    不出废品的机器厂
    重庆惠工机器厂从解放以来，专门修理或制造的成套机器，从来没有出过废品。
    由于这个厂的职工特别注意提高质量，许多大厂都争先请他们修理机床，修理的业务应接不暇。按照厂里的生产能力，每年最多只能修理一百台机床，可是目前就有一百多个单位，计划送来修理的机床达一百七十一台。这个厂每年还能制造四十多台精密度较高的机床。
