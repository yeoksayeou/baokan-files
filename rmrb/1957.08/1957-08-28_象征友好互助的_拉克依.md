　　“Rakhi”: A Symbol of Friendly Cooperation
　　Gao Liang
　　India has a myth: In ancient times, many gods were driven from heaven by demons. They used a rope as a signal to transmit to each other, implying that everyone should unite to fight the demons. As a result, they drove away the demons.
　　About four hundred years ago, when a Hindu queen in Rajasthan, India, was attacked by enemies, she also sent a rope made of silk thread to King Humayun as a sign to ask him for help. King Humayun, who believed in Islam, did not ask about religious differences. Seeing the silk rope, he immediately sent troops to support her and rescued the queen.
　　These myths and stories have been passed down through generations and constitute a colorful festival in Indian social life. Every year in August, when the moon is at its fullest, Indian women, regardless of religion or race, tie ropes woven from silk thread and flowers to their brothers' wrists, expressing their request for their help, protection, and friendship.
　　This festival is called "Raksha Bandhan" (the tie-the-knot protection festival). This beautiful silk rope is called "Rakhi."
　　This year on August 10th, the Indian people celebrated this "Raksha Bandhan." On the eve of the festival, the stalls in the streets of Delhi were filled with golden and silver silk threads, flowers, and sweets. Almost every family's girls were busy weaving beautiful silk ropes for their brothers under the lamplight or moonlight. The next morning, they dressed up, put on their most beautiful and colorful saris, and visited their brothers' homes by carriage, ox cart, or on foot. They first put a red auspicious mark on their brothers' foreheads, then tied the silk rope to their wrists, and asked them to eat sweets. Their brothers greeted them warmly, asked them to stay for dinner, and talked about the brother-sister relationship.
　　Although in this festival women generally tie ropes for men, it historically reflects the urgent need for help from their brothers among Indian women who suffered from feudal oppression. In recent years, even men have been tying ropes for others in this way, expressing a request for support. A friend from Calcutta told me that this is how men in Calcutta do it. He told me that in 1905, when the British Governor-General decided to divide Bengal Province into two provinces in order to further rule India, the great poet Tagore called on the people to unite during the "Rakhi Festival" to oppose the British colonialists' divide-and-rule trick. Barefoot and wearing a pure white robe, he led a long line of people to the streets, tying "Rakhi" on the wrists of all passers-by, asking them to unite to oppose the colonial rulers' conspiracy of division.
　　In this year's "Raksha Bandhan," the All India Women's Federation and some other groups launched "Anti-Atomic Bomb Day." The Indian sisters working in these groups also presented "Rakhi" to their domestic and foreign friends, asking people to support their wish to oppose hydrogen bombs. They tied some "Rakhi" with silk thread trim, tied with a circular pattern, and with the words "Protect Humanity" written on it, to the wrists of foreign friends, and explained the new meaning of this festival to us.
　　That afternoon, about forty young men and women students, professors, businessmen, workers, housewives, and children came to Delhi from Meerut City, more than a hundred miles away. They are all members of the Meerut branch of the "Social Service Association." Exactly one hundred years ago, the first spark of the Indian people's anti-British uprising broke out in their hometown of Meerut. Those rebellious soldiers and people secretly passed around cakes and lotus flowers as a signal for the uprising. Today, they represent this independent city, wearing "Rakhi" on the wrist of Indian Prime Minister Nehru, expressing the highest love for their leader. At the same time, they also presented "Rakhi" to some foreign friends. In the evening, they came to the Chinese Embassy and presented garlands, "Rakhi," and gifts to the Chinese Ambassador Pan Zili. A five-year-old girl with black eye circles also tied her beloved "Rakhi" on Uncle Pan Zili's wrist in applause.
　　Friends from Meerut enthusiastically talked about the significance of this visit and introduced the situation of Meerut's commemoration of the centenary of the War of Independence this year, expressing their desire for peace and friendship after independence. The chairman of this branch, Sharma, said to me: They came to tie ropes for us in order to strengthen the friendship between the people of China and India for thousands of years. They found friendship and support in their Chinese brothers. The secretary-general of the association, Gupta, also pointed to the "Rakhi" on my wrist and said: "This is a Rakhi symbolizing friendly cooperation, it ties together the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and India."

### 象征友好互助的“拉克依”

　　象征友好互助的“拉克依”
　　高梁
    印度有这样一个神话：在古代，许多神被魔鬼从天上赶了下来。他们用一根绳子作信号，互相传递，暗示大家联合起来同魔鬼战斗。结果，他们赶走了魔鬼。
    大约四百多年以前，当印度拉贾斯坦一个信仰印度教的女王受到敌人攻击时，她也派人送了一根用丝线结成的绳子给胡马雍国王，作为向他求救的标记。信仰穆斯林教的胡马雍国王并不问宗教上的区别，看到丝绳后马上派兵前去支援，救出了女王。
    这些神话和故事世代相传，在印度社会生活中构成了一个多采的节日。每当8月间月亮最圆的那一天，印度妇女不分宗教和种族，把用丝线织成的绳子和花朵，系在自己兄弟的手腕上，表示请求他们的帮助、保护和友情。
    这个节日叫“系绳保护节”。这根美丽的丝绳叫“拉克依”。
    今年8月10日，印度人民度过了这个“系绳保护节”。节日前夕，德里街头的小摊上已堆满金色银色的丝线、鲜花和糖果。几乎家家户户的姑娘们忙着在灯光或月亮下为自己的兄弟们编织美丽的丝绳。第二天的清晨，她们就把自己打扮起来，穿上最美丽鲜艳的纱丽，坐着马车、牛车，或者步行，到自己兄弟的家里串门。她们先给她们的兄弟的前额点上红色的吉祥痣，然后把丝绳系在他们的手腕，请他们吃糖。她们的兄弟们亲热地迎接她们，留她们吃饭，并且同她们畅谈兄妹之间的情谊。
    虽然在这个节日中一般是妇女给男子系绳，它在历史上反映出遭受封建社会压迫的印度妇女急迫地需要自己兄弟们的帮助，但近年来，甚至男人也在这样给人系绳，表示请求支持。一位来自加尔各答的朋友对我说，加尔各答的男人就是这样。他告诉我，在1905年，当英国总督为了进一步统治印度决定把孟加拉省分为两个省的时候，伟大诗人泰戈尔曾在“系绳节”号召人民团结起来，反对英国殖民者分而治之的诡计。他赤着脚，穿着洁白的长衣，率领着长列的人群来到街头，在所有行人的腕上系上“拉克依”，请求他们联合起来反对殖民统治者的分治阴谋。
    在今年的“系绳保护节”，印度全国妇女联合会和其他一些团体发起了“反对原子弹”日。在这些团体里工作的印度姊妹们也向本国和外国的朋友们献了“拉克依”，请求人们支持她们反对氢弹的心愿。她们把一些用丝线镶边，系着圆形图案、上面写着“保护人类”的
  “拉克依”，系在外国朋友的手腕上，并向我们解释着这个节日的新的意义。
    当天下午，大约有四十多个青年男女学生、教授、商人、工人、家庭妇女和儿童，从一百多里远的密拉特城赶来德里。他们都是“社会服务协会”密拉特分会的会员。在整整一百年前，他们的家乡密拉特爆发了印度人民反英大起义的第一颗火花，那些起义的士兵和人民，曾暗地里传递着饼子和莲花，作为起义的信号。今天他们代表这个独立的城市，把“拉克依”戴在印度总理尼赫鲁的手腕上，向他们的领袖表示最高的崇爱。同时，他们还向一些外国朋友献了“拉克依”。他们在晚间来到中国大使馆，把花环、“拉克依”和礼物献给中国大使潘自力。一位涂着黑色眼圈的五岁的小姑娘，也在掌声中把她心爱的“拉克依”系在潘自力伯伯的手腕上。
    来自密拉特的友人们热情地谈论着这次前来访问的意义，并且向我们介绍密拉特今年纪念独立战争一百年的情况，表达他们在独立后渴望和平、友好的心情。这个分会的主席夏尔马对我说：他们为加强中印两国人民几千年来的友谊，前来为我们系绳。他们在中国兄弟这里找到了友好和支持。协会的秘书长古普塔也指着我手腕上的“拉克依”说：“这是一根象征友好互助的拉克依，它把中印两国人民牢不可破的友谊系在一起。”（附图片）
