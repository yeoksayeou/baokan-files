Two Experts in Saving Fabric

Residents Zu Rongqin and Chen Jiaodi of Nanjing's Baixia District are skilled at meticulous calculations when using fabric and have become experts in saving it. Here are some examples of how they save fabric:

A bedsheet used as three. The middle of a bedsheet is the easiest place to wear out, while the four sides are often as good as new. So, when the bedsheet wears out for the first time, they cut it open straight down the middle and sew the two sides together to use as the middle. When it wears out a second time, they cut it open horizontally across the middle and sew the two ends together. In this way, they utilize all four sides, which are not easily worn out.

Large altered to medium, medium altered to small, cutting off the sides for new clothes. The collar, sleeves, and edges of clothes are the easiest to wear out, while the middle experiences less friction and is less prone to damage. They cut off the worn areas according to the size of the family members, from large to small, and alter them in sequence, so that one set of clothes can be turned into new clothes several times.

Cotton changed to lined, lined changed to single layer. Because Zu Rongqin's family has many members and their economic conditions are relatively poor, it is difficult to buy all the clothes needed for all four seasons. She uses the method of changing cotton to lined, and lined to single layer, so that a small number of clothes can meet the needs of all four seasons.

Trousers inverted to eliminate worn areas. The knees and buttocks of uniform trousers are the easiest to wear out. So, after wearing them for a certain period of time, they turn the trousers front to back and sew them anew, so that the trousers wear out evenly and the wearing time is extended.

If it is too worn to alter, it can still be used. After clothes have been altered many times and are too worn to be altered again, they do not casually misuse or discard these scraps of cloth. Instead, they wash and dry the scraps, sort them separately, and use the better pieces to patch clothes and sock bottoms. The poorer pieces are pieced together to make diapers (which are softer and easier to use than new cloth). The even poorer pieces are reprocessed to make the stiff lining for shoes, and the worst pieces are kept to make shoe soles.

Because they are meticulous in their calculations in all aspects of using fabric, they have surplus fabric coupons every year. Chen Jiaodi's family of four has a monthly income of more than sixty yuan, which is relatively affluent, and they have not been able to use up their fabric coupons for the past three years. Zu Rongqin's family of ten bought only six zhang of fabric last year.

　　节约用布的两位能手
    南京市白下区的居民祖荣琴和陈姣娣用布善于精打细算，成了节约用布的好手。下面是她们节约用布的事例。
    一条被单当三条用。一条被单最容易磨破的地方是中间；而四边往往是完整如新，所以当被单第一次磨破时，她们就从中间直里剪开，将两边缝上当中间。当第二次又被磨破时，再从中间横里剪开，将两头缝上。如此就将不易磨破的四边全部利用起来。
    大改中，中改小，剪去四边变新装。衣服最容易磨破的是衣领、衣袖及四边，中间磨擦较少，不易破损。她们按照家庭人口的大小，由大到小剪去磨破的地方，挨次改制，使一套服装能几次变成新衣裳。
    棉改夹、夹改单。祖荣琴家因人口多，经济条件较差，四季衣服全部添置有困难，她就采用棉改夹，夹改单的办法，使少量衣服能够应付四季需要。
    裤子倒置、消灭破处。制服裤子最容易磨破的是两膝和臀部，所以在穿到一定时间后，就把裤子前后倒置过来，从新缝制，使一条裤子均衡损坏，延长了穿的时间。
    破得无法改，还可派用场。衣服经过多次改制，破得无法再改时，她们对这些破布也不随便乱用或抛弃，而是将破布洗净晒干，分别整理，将较好的块布用作补衣上袜底，较差的拼起来作尿布（比新布柔软好用），再差的复制做鞋用的硬衬，最差的留了做鞋底。
    由于她们在用布方面处处能精打细算，每年领到的布票都有多余。陈姣娣一家大小四口，每月收入六十多元，经济比较宽裕，三年来布票都用不完。祖荣琴一家大小十口，去年一年只买了六丈多布。
