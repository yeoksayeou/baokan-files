Report from our correspondent Lu Sheng: After Hebei Province inspected and criticized some cadres' right-leaning thoughts in grain work and conducted large-scale socialist education for farmers, the daily figures for grain purchase and storage shifted from a downward trend to an upward trend. According to the Provincial Grain Bureau's statistics on August 8th, the amount of grain stored had reached 76.82% of the province's purchase target.

Hebei's grain purchase work was arranged in early May. Due to the right-wingers' frenzied attacks on socialism, the landlord and rich peasant elements in the countryside taking the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage the work of unified purchase and sales, as well as the influence of some wealthy middle peasants' capitalist thinking, many agricultural cooperatives experienced concealment of production and resistance to the policy of unified grain purchase and sales. At that time, the progress of the purchase work decreased week by week. For example, at the beginning, the province's daily grain storage was 30 million jin, which dropped to 18 million jin in the second week, then to 7.2 million jin in the third week, and further to 4.98 million jin in the fourth and fifth weeks. In order to reverse this situation, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in mid-July, issued an urgent instruction to local county committees throughout the province, calling on the entire party to mobilize, on the one hand, to criticize the right-leaning thinking that hindered the grain purchase work; and on the other hand, to conduct socialist education for farmers, enlightening them to distinguish between right and wrong and sell grain to the state in accordance with the policy.

In the past month, various places have universally convened meetings of socialist construction activists and various symposiums and debates to discuss the benefits of unified purchase and sales, the relationship between individuals and the state, and other issues, and the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers has gradually improved. In Gucheng County, Cangxian Prefecture, various places used typical examples of grain prices and farmers' food consumption before and after the implementation of unified purchase and sales to educate everyone at the meeting, which was very effective. When the farmers recalled that last year they suffered severe floods, but grain prices remained stable, grain supply was not lacking, and no one went out to escape the famine, they remembered the benefits of unified purchase and sales and checked their individualistic and departmentalistic thinking of only caring about themselves and not the country. One hundred and forty cooperatives voluntarily reported concealing a total output of more than 560,000 jin. As a result, the county's purchase task was also increased from the original 5.8 million jin to 7.55 million jin, and the unified sales were reduced from the original 2.23 million jin to 1.66 million jin. Now, the daily storage in the entire Cangxian Prefecture has increased from 1.2 million jin in the previous period to 2.4 million jin, which is twice as high as before the meeting. In Qingyuan County, Baoding Prefecture, many agricultural cooperative members voluntarily took out the surplus grain they had divided and sold it to the state after the debate. After the counties in Xingtai Prefecture criticized the right-leaning thoughts in the cadres, they also reversed the slow progress of the grain purchase work. Handan Prefecture has always grasped tightly from beginning to end, and the meeting was also held early, and now it has overfulfilled the purchase task. At present, the slowest progress is in Tongxian Prefecture, followed by Tianjin Prefecture. The main reason for the slow progress is that these areas have not completely overcome the right-leaning thoughts among the cadres. For example, when the director of the Grain Bureau of Tongxian Prefecture reported the situation to the province, he said: "The wheat has been distributed to the members of the commune, and it is a waste of effort to take it back," believing that there was no certainty of completing the task. At present, the provincial leading organs are helping these areas overcome the right-leaning thoughts of cadres in grain work, so as to lead farmers to further fight against capitalist thoughts in the countryside and strive to complete the purchase task.

    河北粮食入库由慢转快
    大部地区进度快，原因是批判了右倾思想
    通县专区进度慢，原因是还存在右倾情绪
    本报讯　记者鲁生报道：河北省经过检查批判某些干部在粮食工作中的右倾思想和对农民进行大规模的社会主义教育以后，每日征购入库粮食的数字由下降趋势转为上升。据省粮食厅8日统计：全省入库粮食已占全省征购任务的76.82％。
    河北的粮食征购工作在5月上旬就做了布置。由于右派分子向社会主义猖狂进攻和农村中地主富农分子趁机造谣破坏统购统销工作，以及某些富裕中农资本主义思想的影响，不少农业社曾发生了隐瞒产量和抵抗粮食统购统销政策的行为。当时，征购工作的进度一周比一周降低。如开始全省每天入库粮食是三千万斤，到第二周即降为一千八百万斤，到第三周又降到七百二十万斤，到第四周第五周更降到四百九十八万斤。为扭转这种局面，中共河北省委除于7月中旬向全省各地、县委发出紧急指示，号召全党动员起来，一面批判阻碍粮食征购工作的右倾思想；一面向农民进行社会主义教育，启发农民辨明是非，按照政策把粮食卖给国家。
    最近一个月来，各地普遍召开了社会主义建设积极分子大会和各种座谈会、辩论会，讨论统购统销的好处、个人和国家的关系等问题，广大农民社会主义觉悟逐步提高。沧县专区的故城县各地在会议上用实行统购统销前后粮价及农民吃粮情况的典型事例教育大家，收效很好。当农民们回想起去年遭受严重水灾而粮价始终稳定、粮食供应不缺、没有一个人出外逃荒的事实时，都想起了统购统销的好处，纷纷检查只顾自己不顾国家的个人主义、本位主义思想。有一百四十个社自动报出隐瞒产量共五十六万多斤。于是，全县的征购任务也由原来的五百八十万斤增加到七百五十五万斤，统销由原来的二百二十三万斤减少到一百六十六万斤。现在沧县全专区每日入库已由前一时期的一百二十万斤提高到二百四十万斤，较会议前提高了一倍。保定专区的清苑县许多农业社员经过辩论后自动把分掉的余粮拿出来卖给国家。邢台专区各县经过批判干部中的右倾思想以后，也扭转了粮食征购工作进展迟缓的现象。邯郸专区由于党委自始至终抓的紧，会议也开的早，现在已超额完成了征购任务。目前进度最慢的是通县专区，其次是天津专区。进度慢的主要原因是这些地区对干部中的右倾思想还未完全克服。如通县专区粮食局长来省汇报情况时说：“麦子已分到社员手里了，再拿也是白费劲”，认为完成任务没有把握。目前省领导机关正在帮助这些地区克服干部在粮食工作上的右倾思想，以便领导农民进一步向农村中的资本主义思想作斗争，争取全部完成征购任务。
