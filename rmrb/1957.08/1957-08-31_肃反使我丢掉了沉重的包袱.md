　　The Purge Made Me Throw Off a Heavy Burden
　　Zhang Qiming, Technician, Production Department, Ministry of Coal Industry
　　Attacking the Party's purge work and negating the achievements of the purge is a poisonous arrow shot at the Party by many right-wing elements. As someone who has been deeply educated and has deep feelings in the purge movement, I am willing to talk about my own understanding.
　　Ten years ago, when I was in middle school, I joined the Three People's Principles Youth League, and gradually became a key member of the League. I not only did some reactionary work within the League, but more seriously, I participated in some criminal activities that persecuted classmates and helped special agents arrest classmates.
　　After liberation, although I went through a series of movements, I never clearly confessed my criminal activities. I also never mentioned my relationship with the Central Unification (CC) clique’s secret agents. In addition, I also had some reactionary confused thoughts. Seeing the special agent sabotage cases frequently exposed in the newspapers, I felt terrified. Although I was superficially very active and responsible in my work, I was not down-to-earth because I was sick at heart. I always muddled along and dealt with things perfunctorily. I was carrying an extremely painful and heavy burden, and deep down I always held the idea of taking it one day at a time and wasting my life.
　　After the purge movement started, the comrades were very enthusiastic towards me and helped me in many ways, asking me to explain my political history. At first, I adopted an attitude of refusing to confess, but the comrades continued to help patiently. The leadership repeatedly corrected my attitude and explained the policies to me, but I did not feel the slightest bit of the leadership and comrades' painstaking persuasion and education. I always held a skeptical attitude towards the Party's policies. Therefore, when dealing with my crimes, I always tried to avoid the important and dwell on the trivial, only talking about the process but not the content, attempting to muddle through. Under the control of the "fear of crime" mentality, I even took the despicable action of "jumping off a building to commit suicide," attempting to avoid the organization's investigation of me.
　　For someone like me who not only had historical crimes, but also did not confess for a long time, and took despicable means to resist the organization, in principle, it should be "adding crime upon crime," but the organization did not do this, but tried its best to save me. It not only verified the facts from all aspects and clarified my problems, but also tried every means to treat my illness, giving me a considerable amount of time to recuperate and regain my health.
　　After the leadership's multifaceted efforts, my problem was clarified, and the organization made a correct conclusion for me, only giving me an appropriate administrative punishment for my despicable action of "jumping off a building to commit suicide." The heavy burden I had carried for seven years was now completely discarded, and my heart was as light and happy as a stone falling to the ground. Now my work situation is completely the opposite of what it was before the purge. Not only am I down-to-earth and at ease, but I have also begun to see my bright future and have long-term plans for myself, and my work efficiency has also improved. The organization also trusts me more, and also allows me to do more important and comprehensive technical work.
　　I deeply feel that what the People's Daily said in its editorial on July 18th, "Clarifying their doubts, making conclusions, removing their mental burdens, and making it easier for them to work actively is beneficial to both the people's cause and themselves." This is indeed the case. I deeply feel the greatness and correctness of the purge policy!
　　From my own personal experience, the purge is not only timely and correct, but also great. I cannot tolerate the right-wing elements' attempt to release poisonous arrows at the Party on the purge issue. I want to tell the right-wing elements that the purge work was done correctly and well! It was not done wrong or badly!

### 肃反使我丢掉了沉重的包袱

　　肃反使我丢掉了沉重的包袱
    煤炭工业部生产司技术员　张启铭
    攻击党的肃反工作，否定肃反成绩，是许多右派分子向党射出的一枝毒箭。作为在肃反运动中受到深刻教育有深切感受的我，愿意谈谈我自己的认识。
    十年以前，当我在中学念书的时候，曾参加了三青团，并且逐步地成为三青团中的主要分子，我不仅在三青团内作了一些反动工作，更严重的是参加了当时迫害同学及帮助特务逮捕同学的一些罪恶活动。
    解放以后，虽经过了一系列的运动，但我对于自己那些罪恶活动，始终没有交代清楚。和中统特务的关系，也从没有提过。加之我还有一些反动糊涂思想，看到报纸上经常揭发的特务破坏案件，我感到恐惧，在工作中，虽然表面上也很积极负责，但终因心里有病，对待工作并不踏实，总是敷衍搪塞，应付了事。身上背着极端痛苦而又沉重的包袱，心底深处总是抱着拖一天算一天的消磨岁月的思想。
    肃反运动开始后，同志们对我的热情很高，多方帮助我，要我交代政治历史问题。起初我采取了拒不坦白的态度，可是同志们还是继续耐心帮助。领导上再三地给我端正态度，交代政策，而我对于领导上、同志们这种苦口婆心的说服教育，没有丝毫感受，对党的政策总是抱着怀疑的念头，因之在对待自己的罪行上总是避重就轻地只讲过程，不谈内容，企图蒙蔽过关。在“畏罪”的思想支配下，还曾恶劣地采取了“跳楼自杀”的行动，企图避免组织对自己的审查。
    对于我这样一个既有历史罪行，又长期不作交代，而且采取卑劣手段对抗组织的人，按道理讲，应该是“罪上加罪”，但组织并没有这样作，而是仁至义尽地来挽救我，不仅从各方面查证对实，弄清我的问题；而且还想尽办法给我治病，给了我相当长的时间，让我养病，恢复健康。
    经过领导上多方面的努力，我的问题弄清了，组织上给我作了正确的结论，只是对我“跳楼自杀”的恶劣行动，给予了行政上的适当的处分。我背了七年的沉重包袱，现在彻底丢掉了，心里就像一块石头落了地一样的轻松愉快。现在我的工作情况和肃反以前完全相反，不仅踏实安心，而且也开始看到了自己光明的前途，对自己也有了长远的规划，工作效率也提高了。组织对于我也更加相信了，而且还让我作更重要更全面的技术工作。
    我深深感到人民日报在7月18日社论中所说的：“对他们弄清了疑点，做出了结论，使他们去掉了精神负担，便于积极工作，这无论对于人民事业或者对于他们本人，都是有利的。”确是这样。我深深感到肃反政策的伟大和正确！
    从我自己的亲身体验中，肃反不仅是及时的正确的，而且是伟大的。右派分子企图在肃反问题上向党放出毒箭，我是不能容忍的，我要正告右派分子，肃反工作是搞对了，搞好了！并不是搞错了，搞糟了！
