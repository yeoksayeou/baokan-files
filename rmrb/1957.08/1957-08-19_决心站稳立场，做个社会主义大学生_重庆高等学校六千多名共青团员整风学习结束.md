Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 18th: The rectification study carried out among Communist Youth League members in nine higher education institutions in Chongqing has concluded. The focus of this rectification study was on examining stance and viewpoints. According to statistics from six higher education institutions alone, 315 Communist Youth League members were commended for standing firm during the "blooming and contending" period and the anti-rightist struggle, and resolutely fighting to defend the Party and the socialist cause.

The intra-League rectification in each school was carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee, following the victory in the anti-rightist struggle. More than 6,300 Communist Youth League members participated in the rectification study, generally lasting from seven to ten days. During the study sessions, Communist Youth League members from various schools shared the exemplary deeds of many outstanding League members in the struggle against the rightists. Zhang Xiuhua, Liu Yanglie, and others from the Communist Youth League of Southwest Normal College were not intimidated by the rightists' despicable tactics of threats, bribery, attacks, and abuse during the "blooming and contending" period and the anti-rightist struggle. They always stood firm and persisted in the struggle, earning widespread praise from their classmates. Southwest Agricultural College commended the struggle deeds of Communist Youth League members such as Liu Zhiqiang. During the anti-rightist struggle, the Communist Youth League branch of Class Two of the Medical Department of Chongqing Medical College united all fifteen League members and many other students, forming a core force to counterattack the rightists. The entire League branch was therefore commended by the school's League organization.

Through the rectification study, the political consciousness of the League members in various schools has been greatly enhanced. The League organizations have been further purified and consolidated.

    重庆高等学校六千多名共青团员整风学习结束
    据新华社重庆18日电　重庆九所高等学校在共青团员中开展的整风学习已先后结束。这次整风学习以检查立场、观点为中心内容。仅据六所高等学校统计，有三百一十五名共青团员由于在鸣放期间和反右派斗争中站稳立场，坚决为捍卫党和社会主义事业而斗争，受到了表扬。
    各校团内整风都是紧接着反右派斗争获得了胜利，在党委统一领导下进行的。参加整风学习的共青团员有六千三百多名，他们一般都经过七天到十天的学习。在学习会上，各校的共青团员都相互介绍了不少优秀团员在和右派分子斗争中的模范事迹。西南师范学院共青团员张秀华、刘扬烈等在鸣放期间和反右派斗争中，不为右派分子威胁、利诱、打击、谩骂等卑劣手段所吓倒，始终站稳立场，坚持斗争，受到同学们普遍赞扬。西南农学院表扬了共青团员刘志强等人的斗争事迹。重庆医学院医疗系二班共青团支部在反右派斗争中，团结了全班十五名团员和不少同学，形成了反击右派的核心力量，整个团支部因此受到学校团组织的表扬。
    各校团组织经过整风学习，团员们的政治觉悟都大为提高。团组织得到了进一步纯洁和巩固。
