Swimming and Diving Championships Continue
　　PLA Athletes Win First Place in 4x400m Relay

　　(Our Dispatch) The National Swimming and Diving Championships continued yesterday at the Taoranting Swimming Pool. Yesterday, a total of six preliminary rounds, fifteen finals, and the boys' and girls' springboard diving competitions were held.

　　4x400m Medley Relay Victory Not Easy
　　The women's Group A 4x400m medley relay final was the most exciting event yesterday. In the first leg, the backstroke, Shanghai athlete Huang Guojin took the lead, leaving PLA athlete Yu Bizhen, who was closely following her, behind by about two meters. In the second leg, the breaststroke, PLA athlete Lu Yuexian caught up after entering the water, eventually overtaking the Shanghai team by two meters. In the third leg, the butterfly stroke, the Shanghai team's athlete was Dai Lihua, the national record holder for the 100m butterfly. With her efforts, the Shanghai team temporarily took the lead again. In the final leg, the freestyle, the PLA athlete was Huang Huiying, who has rich competition experience. With her efforts and sprint, she finally surpassed Shanghai's Li Tianran and reached the finish line first. The PLA team won first place with a time of five minutes and forty and seven-tenths seconds.

　　Impressive Results in the Boys' 400m Freestyle
　　The results of the boys' 400m freestyle final were very satisfactory. The six young athletes had correct movements and powerful strokes, and all finished the 400m distance within five minutes and forty-two seconds. The first place, Zhang Shutian from Tianjin, achieved a time of five minutes and ten and five-tenths seconds, only one and a half seconds slower than the first-class athlete standard. The last place was Lin Lanquan from Guangzhou, whose time was five minutes and forty-one and five-tenths seconds, twelve and a half seconds faster than the second-class athlete standard.

　　Shanghai Athletes Sweep Top Three in Diving
　　In the men's Group B springboard diving competition, the top three places were all taken by Shanghai diving athletes. They were: first place, Zheng Wenfu (score of 103.63 points), second place, Zhang Qianlin (score of 99.03 points), and third place, Jiang Haoquan (score of 90.87 points). Zheng Wenfu's score exceeded the first-class athlete standard of 100 points.

　　In last year's Shanghai diving competition, the top three were Jiang Haoquan, Zhang Qianlin, and Zheng Wenfu. This time, the order was reversed. It is understood that Jiang Haoquan, a veteran with more than ten years of diving experience, did not practice for a long time due to a sprained waist, so he finished third in this competition.

　　Li Xiqing Leads All the Way
　　In the men's 1500m freestyle final, Guangdong athlete Li Xiqing had powerful movements and sufficient endurance, so he led all the way. When he reached the finish line, the other six athletes were far behind; the last athlete was more than 180 meters behind him. PLA athlete Tian Fengzao, who won second place, only swam to 101 meters from the finish line. Li Xiqing's time was twenty minutes and twenty-six and seven-tenths seconds.

　　Another Butterfly Stroke Talent
　　Sixteen-year-old Guangzhou少年 athlete Su Tiexiong won first place in the men's junior group 100m butterfly final with a time of one minute and twelve and six-tenths seconds. This time not only exceeded the first place in the men's adult group B 100m butterfly event (one minute and thirteen seconds), but also exceeded the first-class athlete standard of one minute and fourteen seconds. He is another young athlete who has reached the level of a first-class athlete after Lu Xixia.

　  游泳、跳水锦标赛继续举行
　　解放军运动员取得四百公尺接力赛第一名
    本报讯　全国游泳、跳水锦标赛昨日在陶然亭游泳场继续举行。昨日总共举行了六项预赛、十五项决赛和少年组男、女跳板跳水的比赛。
　  四百公尺混合接力取胜不易
    女子甲组四百公尺混合接力决赛是昨天最精彩的比赛项目。在第一棒仰泳比赛中，上海运动员黄帼巾占了优势，把紧跟在她后面的解放军选手余碧珍丢下约两公尺。第二棒蛙泳时，解放军运动员陆月仙下水后奋起直追，结果反超过了上海队两公尺。第三棒蝶泳，上海队的选手是百公尺蝶泳全国纪录创造者戴丽华，在她的努力下，上海队又暂占先。最后一棒自由泳时，解放军的选手是富有比赛经验的黄慧英，在她的努力冲刺下，终于超过了上海队的李天然，首先到达了终点。解放军队以五分四十秒七的成绩获得第一名。
    少年组四百公尺自由泳成绩惊人
    少年组男子四百公尺自由泳决赛的成绩很令人满意。六名少年运动员动作正确，划水有力，都在五分四十二秒内游完了四百公尺的距离。第一名天津市张树田的成绩达到了五分十秒五，比一级运动员标准仅差一秒半。最后一名是广州市的林兰权，他的成绩是五分四十一秒五，比二级运动员标准还要快十二秒五。
　  上海健儿包办跳水前三名
    在男子乙组跳板跳水比赛中，前三名都被上海市的跳水健儿取得。他们是：第一名郑文甫（成绩一百零三点六三分）、第二名张钱林（成绩九十九点三分）、第三名蒋浩泉（成绩九十点八十七分）。郑文甫的成绩超过了一级运动员一百分的规定标准。
    在去年举行的上海市跳水比赛中，前三名是蒋浩泉、张钱林、郑文甫，这次比赛中却反了过来。据了解有十多年跳水经验的老将蒋浩泉，因扭坏了腰很长时期没有练习，所以这次比赛曲居了第三名。
    李喜庆一路领先
    在男子一千五百公尺自由泳决赛中，广东省运动员李喜庆动作有力，耐力足，因此一路领先。当他到达终点时其他六名运动员都远远地落在后面；最后一名运动员和他相距一百八十多公尺。获得第二名的解放军运动员田凤澡也只游到距终点一百零一公尺的地方。李喜庆的成绩是二十分二十六秒七。
    又一名蝶泳好手
    十六岁的广州市少年运动员苏铁雄，在男子少年组百公尺蝶泳决赛中，以一分十二秒六的成绩获得了第一名，这个成绩不但超过了男子成人乙组百公尺蝶泳第一名的成绩（一分十三秒），而且超过了一级运动员一分十四秒的标准。他是继卢细虾之后又一个达到一级运动员水平的少年运动员。
