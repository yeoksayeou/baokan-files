Shandong Province Saves More Than Six Million Meters of Cloth

Jinan, August 21 (By our reporter) - In the third year of planned cotton cloth supply, Shandong Province will save more than 6.6 million meters of industrial and public-use cloth compared to the original plan. This cloth can be used to make more than 1.3 million sets of single-layer garments.

After the central government issued instructions on saving cotton cloth at the beginning of this year, textile companies at all levels in Shandong Province began to focus on this work and received widespread support from government agencies, enterprises, and the people. The saving of industrial cloth is mainly due to the vigorous recovery of cotton, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn wrapping cloth and increasing the recycling rate. Collective catering units have changed from recovering only a small portion of flour sacks to recovering all of them, and the recycling price of wrapping cloth has also been appropriately increased. The original plan for cotton wrapping cloth was 3.5 million meters, but after increasing the recycling rate, only 1.4 million meters were used. When approving public-use cloth, textile companies at all levels paid attention to investigating the situation and carefully discussed saving methods with users, avoiding use when possible, reducing use when possible, and using substitutes when possible. From April to July, 1,762 units in Jinan City applied for more than 495,000 meters of public-use cloth, but after research, this was reduced to 94,000 meters. Qingdao City improved the tailoring methods of work clothes, saving 6,000 meters of cloth in the second quarter.

　　山东节省六百多万公尺布
    本报济南21日电　棉布计划供应第三年度，山东全省较原计划能节约工业用布、公用布六百六十多万公尺，用这些布可以做一百三十多万套单衣。
    今年年初中央发布了节约棉布的指示后，山东全省各级纺织品公司就开始抓紧这一工作，并且得到了机关企业和人民群众的广泛支持。工业用布的节约，主要是大力收回棉花、棉布、棉纱的包皮布，提高回用率。集体伙食单位的面粉袋由少部分收回改为全部回收，包皮布的回收价格也适当提高了。棉花包皮布原计划用布三百五十万公尺，提高回用率后，只用了一百四十万公尺。在批准公用布时，各级纺织品公司注意调查情况，和用户仔细讨论节约办法，能够不用的就不用，能够少用的就少用，能够用代用品的就用代用品。济南市4至7月份一千七百六十二个单位申请公用布四十九万五千多公尺，经过研究，减少到九万四千公尺。青岛市改善了工作服的剪裁方法，第二季度节约用布六千公尺。
