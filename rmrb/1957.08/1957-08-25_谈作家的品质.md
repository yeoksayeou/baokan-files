　　On the Qualities of Writers
　　Zhou Jianren

    The emergence, development, revolution, and victory of the proletariat is an unprecedented event in human history. To change the private ownership system that has been practiced for so many years into a public ownership system is a tremendous transformation. Because its change alters people's lives, it also changes people's character. From then on, he (man) will shed selfishness, narrow-mindedness, jealousy, exclusion, meanness, etc., and transform into the proletariat, advancing together towards a brighter, wiser, and greater future, becoming truly glorious human beings.

    As for writers, in countries where the revolution has not been victorious for long, such as China, it can be said that they mostly come from non-working-class backgrounds. The word "mostly" indicates that it does not refer to the entire group; there may already be some writers of proletarian origin writing. But there is no doubt that the majority come from the petty bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie, or the landlord class.

    The term "come from" refers to the writer's origin, meaning that various writers come from various classes. Different classes have different characteristics. But generally speaking, abstractly speaking, those with property (no matter how much) under the private ownership system have a common characteristic: individualism and the associated selfishness.

    It is also true that individuals of the same class have different personalities. However, personality does not transcend class character. It is difficult to imagine that the personality of any individual from the bourgeoisie or petty bourgeoisie would be completely unlike that of others in the same class, and completely like that of industrial workers living in a collective. However, in an era of great class changes, personality plays a significant role in changing an individual's class stance. This era refers to the era from the rise of the proletariat to the occurrence of revolution and its victory. During this period, the propertied classes declined one after another. Although there are very few examples of workers leaving their own class and turning to the opposing bourgeoisie, the majority are those who betray their own class and transfer to the proletariat from the petty bourgeoisie (or the bourgeoisie). The struggle between opposing classes is absolute, but individual character is relative, so an individual's class stance can be transferred. Otherwise, it would be somewhat incomprehensible to say that every individual of a certain class is a spokesperson for their own class interests, and yet also say that an individual's class stance can be transferred (which is also a fact).

    Now, let's talk about the qualities of writers; the implicit meaning refers to literary writers. Although scientists and technicians also often write works, their main work is research and exploration. When they have insights, they also write articles (scientists who engage in popular science writing for the purpose of popularizing science are another matter), but generally speaking, scientists and technicians are researchers, not primarily engaged in writing.

    Literary writers are different. If they do not engage in writing, they abandon their profession. Even if they observe society and experience life, if they do not write, then they are no different from tourists who simply enjoy the scenery and don't even hum a few bad poems. If they don't even observe and experience, then aren't they somewhat similar to the landlords of the past who were "well-fed all day long and had nothing to occupy their minds"? Of course, it is another matter if they have already changed careers or are busy with other things.

    In the process of building socialism, it is certainly most desirable for all intellectuals to quickly transform into socialists. This is the best thing. And it is especially urgent for literary writers. Literary writers are different from scientists and technicians. Scientific and technical research reports certainly contain ideas, but if they are not theoretical, as long as they are objectively true and correct, their discoveries or inventions are useful. However, in literary works, a series of ideas runs through the writer's work, which is the crystallization of thought. When readers read the work, they immediately come into contact with the writer's thoughts and see whether he stands on the side of the people, the side of progress, or the side against the people and against progress. It is easy to recognize whether he is welcoming new and progressive things or lingering over old and backward things. If it represents the latter atmosphere, it will never be welcomed by the working masses. Therefore, in a socialist society, it is obvious that it is not only required that literary writers understand socialism, but it is further required that they be scientific socialists standing on the proletarian standpoint.

    As mentioned earlier, in societies where socialism has not been victorious for long, intellectuals mostly come from non-proletarian backgrounds; but in a period of great class changes, according to the different natures in each person's personality, there are certainly not a few who break away from their own class and stand on the side of the proletariat. The so-called personality here refers to nothing more than the total result of the interweaving of all the various factors that have a formative effect and his own reactions to these factors when a person is not yet "stereotyped" from birth to adulthood.

    However, there are also some intellectuals who have a very strong individualism and great ambitions. They may have expressed some dissatisfaction with the old society. However, their dissatisfaction with the old society does not stem from collectivism, but from individualism. If these people's thoughts are not reformed and replaced, and they still pursue the insatiable selfishness of individualism; then the more socialist construction advances, the more they will feel that their selfish goals are not approaching but moving further away. The more dissatisfied they will feel. This principle is easy to understand. And once the revolution is victorious, the enemy oppression on their heads is removed, the common goal of opposition is gone, and ambition will develop. What develops is not the idea of collectivism but individualistic things; the goal they pursue is not to change the system, but just to change the personnel, to climb from a lower position to a higher position; the result will inevitably be a change in the focus of struggle, turning to the Party and socialism that do not allow him to do so. Among the right-wing elements exposed today, apart from the consistently anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing elements, the right-wing elements who did not show any anti-Party words or deeds before liberation and newly appeared after the victory of the revolution are mostly due to this situation. Because his individualistic ambition remains unchanged, or not only unchanged but expanded, in fact, in terms of nature, their anti-Party stance is also consistent.

    We don't need to look for evidence far away, we can find this kind of situation just by looking at Ding Ling's and Chen Qixia's anti-Party words and deeds in the newspapers at hand.

    Ding Ling's and Chen Qixia's incidents are very complicated, and it is impossible to talk about them in a short article. Let's just mention Ding Ling's "one book doctrine" first. She once promoted to young authors: "As long as a person writes a book, no one can defeat him." Speaking of being defeated, as long as a person loyally serves the people and strives for the cause of the liberation of all mankind, even if he does not write a book, because of the leadership and support of the Party, and the support of the people and even all mankind, he will never be defeated. As for the author, of course, he must write, but Ding Ling abandoned all the progressive significance of writers engaging in writing, such as building socialism, fighting against the enemy, and educating the masses of readers, and regressed and reduced it to being just a tool for striving for personal fame and fortune! Implicitly, it means that as long as people have a book, they will be famous, have a position, and can act recklessly. Because anyway, they can't be defeated. Of course, young authors should be encouraged to write, but it should be explained that writing is for socialist culture and to create happiness for the people, not as a means of competing for fame and position. Now, Ding Ling's promotion of this thorough individualism is a very harmful idea to young authors. If this extreme individualistic idea occupies the mind, how can one not "adopt a sectarian and exclusionary attitude towards some accomplished writers inside and outside the Party"? (People's Daily, August 7, page 4). Starting from this kind of thinking, one will inevitably go to anti-Party words and deeds.

    Chen Qixia's idea of "a scholar dies for his confidant" is also extremely bad. This harmful idiom has long existed in feudalism, but it is still appreciated by some backward people today! In the socialist camp, each individual can only die for the revolutionary cause, for the happy future of all mankind, not for a certain "confidant." If you say confidant, then all loyal comrades-in-arms in the same camp are confidants, and when it is necessary to die for the revolutionary cause, they also become confidants of future generations. But Chen Qixia's so-called "a scholar dies for his confidant" is obviously not this meaning. He wants to pull people out of the scope of distinguishing between right and wrong and go to the circle of using "small favors." In ancient times, some people used small favors to buy people's hearts, asking people to recognize him as a confidant, to be used by him, and to die for him. This feudal idea is very harmful, it is conducive to the combination of small groups, and the result will inevitably become a call to attack the Party.

    Writers in the socialist era must not only support the Party and socialism, but also be thorough Marxists-Leninists standing on the working-class position, so that his works can truly serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and can truly increase the wealth of socialist culture. If a writer maintains the individualistic ambition he brought from the old society unchanged, the more socialist construction advances, the more he will feel that his possibility of acting arbitrarily will be less and less, and it is inevitable that he will have anti-Party and anti-socialist emotions.

    Therefore, writers in the new society must change their position from the old society, that is, they must put their buttocks on the side of the proletariat, and not always sit in the position of the non-working class. How to change the position? The problem is still in self-education and self-transformation. Position refers to class or left and right factions. It refers to the place where the feet stand, and thought refers to a kind of activity of the brain function. But the head and feet are very related, if the thought is cleared, the position will also change. If intellectuals are self-loving, not self-abandoning, want to make progress, and do not want to be the dregs of the old society, then ideological reform is not difficult. The Party is calling, it all depends on how the subjective effort is: whether to be a firm and progressive literary worker in the process of socialist construction, or to be an object of ridicule and spurn by thousands of people? It's all in your own choice!

　　谈作家的品质
　　周建人
    无产阶级的产生，发展，革命，胜利，是人类的历史上空前未有的大事。把多少年来施行的私有制改变成为公有制，这是非常巨大的变革。因它的改变改变了人的生活，同时也改变了人的性格。他（人）从此从自私，偏狭，妒忌，排斥，卑鄙，等等的性格中蜕化出来，转变到无产阶级里来，并一同向更光明，智慧，伟大的前途前进，成为真正的，光辉的人类。
    至于作家，在革命胜利尚未久的国家，例如中国，可以这样说，还大抵来自非工人阶级的。所谓“大抵”，表示不是指全体，可能已有些无产阶级出身的作家在写作；但没有疑问，多数是从小资产阶级，资产阶级，或地主阶级来的。
    所谓“来自”，是指作家的出身，意思各种不同的作家出身于各种不同的阶级。阶级不同，性格有所各异。但概括地抽象地说，在私有制度下面的有财产者（不论多少），都有一个共通性格，便是个人主义和相联带的自私自利。
    阶级相同的个人又各有不相同的个性也是的确的，不过个性并不超越阶级性。资产阶级或小资产阶级的任何个人，他的个性表现很难设想与同阶级的他人完全不像，而和集体生活的产业工人却完全相像的。但是在阶级大变动时代，个性在改变个人的阶级立场上却起着极大的作用。这一时代就是指无产阶级兴起以至于发生革命及获得胜利的时代。其间有产阶级都相继没落。其间虽亦有极少数的工人有离开自己的阶级，转向为相对立的资产阶级去的例子，但大多数是由小资产阶级（或资产阶级）背叛自己的阶级而转移到无产阶级去。对立阶级的斗争是绝对的，但个人的性格却是相对的，因此个人的阶级立场能够转移。否则既说是每个一定阶级的个人都是代表自己阶级利益的代言人，而又说个人的阶级立场可以转移（也是事实），就有些不可理解了。
    现在讲到作家的品质；不言中的意思是在指文艺作家。科学技术家虽然也常写著作，但他们的主要工作却是研究，探讨。有心得时也写成文章（为了普及科学的目的从事通俗科学写作的科学家又当别论），但一般说来，科技家是钻研家，不是以写作为本务的。
    而文艺作家却不然，他如果不从事写作，便放弃业务。他纵使在观察社会，体验生活，但不写作，那么和从前连坏诗也不哼几句的单纯游山玩水的游客就没什么区别了。如果连观察与体验也不做，那么和以前“饱食终日，无所用心”的地主老爷岂不倒有些近似？如果已经转业，或忙于别的事情的当然是另一回事。
    在建设社会主义的进程里，当然最希望所有知识分子迅速都改造成为社会主义者。这是最好不过的事。而且对于文艺作家尤为迫切。文艺作家不同于科技家，科技家的研究报告里当然具有思想，但是要是不属理论性的，只要客观上是真实的，正确的，他的发现或发明便有用处。可是文艺的作品里，一系列贯穿着作家的思想，是思想的结晶。读者读作品的时候，立刻接触到作家的思想，看到他站在人民方面，进步方面，还是反人民和反进步方面。他是在欢迎新的进步的东西，还是在留恋旧的落后的东西。是很容易识别出来的。要是代表着后一种气氛，就决不可能获得劳动大众的欢迎。因此在建设社会主义的社会里，不仅要求文艺作家懂得社会主义，必须进一步要求他是站在无产阶级立场上的科学社会主义者，是很明显不过的事情。
    前面已经说到，在社会主义胜利还不久的社会里，知识分子大抵从非无产阶级来的；但在阶级发生大变化的时期，依照各人个性中性质的不同，脱离自己的阶级，站到无产阶级来的当然不在少数。这里所谓个性，无非指其人从出生、到长大当中还未“定型化”时，一切所遭受到有形成作用的各种因素与他自身对此等因素起反应作用交织而成的总成果。
    但也有一些知识分子，个人主义很强，野心很大。对于旧社会也很可能表示过一些不满。不过他的对旧社会不满，不是从集体主义出发，而是从个人主义出发的。要是这些人的思想不改造更换，仍然追求饕餮无厌的个人主义的自私自利时；那么社会主义建设愈推进，他会觉到和他自私的目的不是接近而是距离愈远。他会愈感觉不满。这道理是很容易明白的。并且革命一经胜利，压在头上的敌人压迫已除去，共同反对的目的没有了，野心会发展起来。所发展的不是集体主义的思想而是个人主义的东西；他追求的目的不是要改变制度，而是只要改变一下人事，从较低的位置爬上更高的位置；其结果必然会改变斗争的锋芒转向不允许他这样做的党和社会主义方面来的。今日揭发出来的右派分子当中，除一贯反党反社会主义的右派分子以外，在解放前看不出什么反党言行，革命胜利后新出现的反对党的右派分子，大抵有由于这种情况。由于他的个人主义野心不变，或不但不变而反扩大，实际上，从性质上说，他们的反党也是一贯的。
    我们不必去遥远地去找寻证据，只要在手边的报纸上看看丁玲和陈企霞的反党言行里就可以找到这一类情况。
    丁玲和陈企霞的事件很繁琐，短文里不可能多讲。只要先把丁玲的“一本书主义”提一提。她曾向青年作者宣传：“一个人只要写出一本书来，就谁也打他不倒。”讲到被打倒，一个人只要忠诚地为人民服务，为全人类解放事业努力，就是不写书，因有党的领导与支持，有人民以至全人类的支持，决不会被打倒的。至于作者当然是要写作的，但丁玲把作家从事著作的一切进步意义，如建设社会主义，对敌斗争，教育读者群众的意义都抛弃了，而退化、缩小到说成只是争取个人名利地位的工具！不言中意味着人们只要有了一本著作，便有名了，有地位了，可以肆行无忌了。因为反正打不倒了。对青年作者当然应当鼓励他们写作，但应当说明写作是为了社会主义文化，为人民造福祉，不应说成争名位的手段。现在丁玲宣传的这种彻底的个人主义的思想，对于青年作者是十分有害的思想。倘让这宗极端个人主义的思想盘踞脑中，安得不“对党内外一些有成就的作家采取宗派主义的排斥的态度”？（人民日报8月7日四版）。从这种思想出发也必然会走到反党的言行上去的。
    陈企霞的“士为知己者死”的思想也是极恶劣的。这宗有害的成语在封建主义里已早存在，不料至今还为一部分落后的人所赏识！在社会主义阵营的各个人，在不可避免时，只有为革命事业而死，为全人类的幸福前途而死，决不是为某一“知己”而死。如说知己，则凡属同一阵营里的忠实战友都是知己，为了革命事业不得不死时，也成为后代未来男女的知己。但陈企霞所谓“士为知己者死”显然不是这种意思，他要把人从辨别大是大非的范围中拉出来，走到施用“小恩小惠”的圈子中去。古代有一些人施用些小恩小惠，收买人心，叫人认他为知己，为他所用，并为他去死。这种封建思想十分有害，是有利于小集团的结合，结果必然会成为向党进攻用的号召的。
    社会主义时代的作家不但必须是拥护党，拥护社会主义的，而且必须是彻底地站在工人阶级立场上的马列主义者，他的作品才能真正为工、农、兵服务，才能真正为社会主义文化增加财富。如果作家保持着从旧社会里带来的个人主义野心不变，社会主义建设愈推进，他会感觉到他作威作福的可能将愈少，会发生反党反社会主义的情绪是必然的。
    因此，新社会里的作家必须改变从前旧社会里的立场，便是须把屁股坐到无产阶级方面来，不要老坐在非工人阶级的位置上。立场如何改变呢？问题还是在自我教育，自我改造。立场本是指阶级或左右派别而言。它是指脚站的场所，思想是指头脑机能的一种活动。但是头与脚很有关联，如思想搞通，立场也就会改变。要是知识分子是自爱的，不是自暴自弃的，是要求进步的，不是愿做旧社会的渣滓，那么思想改造并没有什么困难。党正在号召，只要看主观努力怎么样：在社会主义建设的进行中要做一个坚定、进步的文艺工作者呢，还是愿作为万人笑骂与唾弃的对象？全在自己的抉择！
