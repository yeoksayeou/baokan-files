　　Poetry Kingdom
　　——A Chronicle of Bai Customs in Eryuan
　　Shuyun
    Arriving in the Bai villages of the western mountainous region of Eryuan, one feels as if entering a kingdom of poetry.

      Every evening, as night quietly descends upon the villages, the mountain people gather around the blazing fire pit and begin to sing. The songs and laughter wash away the day's fatigue, leading people into a world of love and imagination. At this time, it is mostly antiphonal singing, with a man and a woman singing; others cheer from the sidelines, but often can't help but chime in with a few lines, joining the antiphonal singing. If they meet their match, they sing and sing, and the singing is like a flowing stream, unable to stop, often continuing until the east turns white.

    In other areas, one cannot sing tunes in front of parents and elders, but the situation in the western mountainous region is just the opposite. When children sing antiphonally with others, their parents sit close to them. If their daughter cannot answer, the mother will quietly prompt her with a few words; if the daughter answers incorrectly, causing everyone to laugh, the mother will blush with shame, feeling dishonored. The father stays close to his son, similarly concerned about his success or failure in the competition. Some girls are afraid to accept the other party's challenge, and their mother will say loudly: "My girl, don't be afraid, sing everything your mother taught you."

    It turns out that, according to the customs here, parents must teach their children many tunes. If the children sing well and memorize many tunes later, it means that the parents have educated them well and will receive public praise. Here, children learn to speak and learn tunes almost simultaneously. Impatient parents often start teaching tunes before their children can even speak clearly. There is a little girl whose pronunciation is not yet clear, but she can already recite more than two hundred tunes. It can be said that this is a unique form of enlightenment education. Through beautiful tunes, parents allow their children to begin to understand the world and life, sowing the seeds of beautiful spirit in pure hearts.

    Young men who don't memorize many tunes often embarrass themselves. Sometimes, amidst peals of laughter, several young men are surrounded by a group of girls, who hold hands and ask them to sing antiphonally. If they can't answer, they will swarm up, playfully hitting them, making the young men blush as red as pig's liver. Tunes, in fact, become a second language, a major tool for young men and women to convey love.

    During the upsurge of cooperativization, when the farmers in the western mountainous region heard that the establishment of cooperatives had been approved, they held celebration rallies everywhere. At night, there were crowds of people all over the mountains and fields, surrounding bonfires, singing and dancing wildly, and spontaneously composing many poems praising the new life, singing until dawn. They sang and danced wildly like this for several days.

    There is also a narrative tune in the western mountains called "Dage" (Striking Song). The most valuable one is the "Dage" that narrates the Bai people's creation myth: in the primordial era, there was no heaven or earth, and the entire universe was just a vast ocean, with a golden drum floating in the sea. Later, the golden drum was opened by a divine bird, and a man and a woman jumped out, who were the ancestors of mankind. These two people gave birth to children and multiplied humanity. All ethnic groups were originally brothers and sisters, but later, due to various reasons, they formed today's different ethnic groups. In addition, it also narrates the origin of various things... They are all completely different from the creation myths of other ethnic groups. There are also many "Dage" that are folk tales.

    Dage are mostly held on days of weddings, funerals, and celebrations. In the square, people form a circle, each holding a bowl of wine, singing and moving slowly with simple dance steps. The form of singing is question and answer. For example, ask: "What do you use as a pen?" Everyone sings: "Use the light of the sun as a pen." "What do you use as paper?" Answer: "Use the earth as paper." Dage are less strict in meter than folk tunes.

    The tunes of the western mountains are rich, estimated to be tens of thousands or more. The people of the western mountains often say: "The Sui River flows endlessly, the tunes of the western mountains can never be sung completely." There is a story that explains why there are so many tunes in the western mountains, and the story is quite flavorful:

    A long time ago, humans could not sing tunes, so heaven sent a god to scatter a few liters of tune seeds among the people. After he scattered some in other areas, he still had more than a liter of tune seeds left on him. He came to the western mountainous region and died here. Therefore, the western mountainous region alone has a liter of tune seeds, and the tune reserves are abundant thereafter.

    Not long ago, the government's cultural department sent cadres here to collect western mountain tunes. The cadres were warmly welcomed by the masses, who called them "tune hangers" and vied to have them write down the tunes they remembered, saying: "Write it down! Please write down my best tunes, or I won't be able to sleep." Dear readers, soon you will be able to read the beautiful Bai Western Mountain tunes.

　　诗歌王国
　　——洱源白族风俗纪
　　曙云
    到了洱源西山区的白族村寨，就仿佛走进了诗歌的王国。
      每天傍晚，当夜幕悄悄地落下村寨，山民们就围着熊熊的火塘唱起来。歌声和笑声洗去了白天的劳顿，把人们引进了爱情和想像的世界。这个时候多半是对唱，一男一女唱着；其他的人在旁助兴，但往往情不自禁的凑上几句，加入了对唱。如果棋逢对手，唱呀唱呀，歌声就像小河流水，无法停住，往往就会唱到东方发白才能停止。
    其他地区，在父母和长辈跟前是不能唱调子的，而西山区情况刚刚相反。当儿女和别人对唱的时候，爹妈都紧紧坐拢他（她）。如果自己女儿对答不出来，妈妈会悄悄的提示几句；要是女儿对答错了，引起大家哄笑，妈妈会羞得脸红，觉得不光采。做父亲的则挨拢自己儿子，也是同样地关心他的竞赛成败。有的姑娘不敢迎接对方的挑战，她妈就会大声说：“阿囡，别怕，把阿妈教你的都唱出来。”
    原来，按照这里的风俗，做父母的要教儿女掌握许多调子。如果以后儿女调子唱得好，背得多，就意味着父母教育有方，会得到舆论的好评。这里小孩子学话和学调子，几乎是同时进行的。性急的父母往往等不到儿女会说话，就开始传授调子了。有个小姑娘，说话的口音还没有咬清，可是她已经能背出两百多首调子。可以说，这是一种独特的启蒙教育。通过优美的调子，父母让儿女开始认识世界，认识生活，在一颗颗纯洁的心灵里，撒播了优美的精神籽种。
    小伙子们如果调子背得不多，往往会出丑的。有时候，随着咯咯的哄笑，几个小伙子就被一群少女包围住，她们手牵着手，要他们对唱，如果对不出，她们会蜂涌而上，嬉戏式的打着，把小伙子们羞得脸像猪肝一样红。调子事实上成为第二种语言，成为少男少女们传达爱情的主要工具。
    合作化高潮的时候，西山区农民听得被批准办社，到处都开庆祝大会。入夜，漫山遍野都有人群，他们围着灯火，狂欢歌唱，并即兴地编了许多赞美新生活的诗歌，一直唱到天亮。这样狂歌狂舞了好几天。
    西山上还有一种叙事性质的调子，名为“打歌”。最宝贵的一篇是叙述白族的创世纪的“打歌”：在洪荒时代，没有天，也没有地，整个宇宙只是一片汪洋大海，海里飘浮着一只金色的鼓。后来，金鼓被一种神鸟敲开，里面跳出一男一女，这便是人类的祖先。这两个人生儿育女，繁殖了人类。各个民族原先都是兄弟姐妹关系，后来因为种种原因，才形成今天的不同民族。另外，还叙述了各种各样事物的起源……。它们都和其他民族创世纪的传说迥乎不同的。还有许多“打歌”都是一些民间故事。
    打歌多半在婚丧喜事的日子举行。在广场上，人们围成一个圆圈，每人抬着一碗酒，一边唱，一边用简单的舞步徐缓走动着。唱的形式是一问一答。例如问：“拿什么东西做笔？”大家就唱：“拿太阳的光线做笔。”“拿什么东西做纸。”答：“拿大地做纸。”打歌比起民家调来，格律不太严格。
    西山调子是丰富的，估计有几万首以上。西山人常说：“流不尽的穗江水，唱不完的西山调。”有一个故事，说明西山调子为什么很多，故事是颇有风味的：
    很遥远的时候，人类都不会唱调子，于是上天派了一个神，带着几升调子的籽种到民间撒播。当他在其他地区撒了一些后，身上还有一升多调子籽种，他来到西山区，死在这里。因此，仅仅西山区就有一升的调子籽种，往后调子的蕴藏就丰富了。
    不久以前，政府文艺部门派了干部到这里采集西山调。干部们受到群众极大欢迎，大家称他们是“挂调子的人”，争着要他们把自己记得的调子写下来，说：“写吧！请你把我最好的这些调子写上，不然我就睡不着了。”亲爱的读者们，不久以后，你将能够读到优美的白族西山调了。
