Xinhua News Agency, August 2nd. The Chinese Academy of Sciences held a conference on the 1st and 2nd to expose and denounce the right-wing elements within the Party, Xu Liangying and Li Deqi.

Researchers at the Institute of Philosophy, including many old friends, old classmates, and colleagues who had worked with Xu Liangying, presented a large amount of specific material to expose Xu Liangying's political face of opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism. Xu Liangying, who came from a landlord family of local bullies, had been in opposition to the Party every time his personal ambitions suffered setbacks since joining the Party in 1946. Especially after the start of the anti-rightist struggle, his anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds became even more rampant. After the People's Daily published editorials against the rightists starting on June 8th, Xu roared with rage after reading them, wanting to tear up the People's Daily. He peddled rumors from right-wing elements, nonsensically saying that "the Party Central Committee has split," that "Chairman Mao is being opposed by senior cadres engaged in sectarianism who want revenge, which is very un-'moral'," and that "Chairman Mao has compromised," and so on. He ran around agitating, spreading his dissatisfaction with the Central Committee and the People's Daily's anti-rightist editorials to more than twenty people in more than ten units, including the Academy of Sciences headquarters, several research institutes, and the Central Youth League School. He promoted so-called bourgeois "democracy" to them and advocated anti-Party and anti-socialist big-character posters. He believed that neither the Party Central Committee, the leader, nor anyone else deserved to be trusted, and that only his own "independent thinking" could be trusted. After the Party Committee Secretary of the Academy of Sciences educated him, he still insisted on his anti-socialist and anti-Communist Party stance and viewpoints, saying that he would resolutely oppose the Party Central Committee's approach (referring to the anti-rightist struggle). He threatened to "sacrifice his Party membership" and prepared two escape routes for himself: "returning to his hometown to farm" or "going to a capitalist country to do 'underground work'."

In his "self-criticism" at the meeting, Xu Liangying claimed that he was objectively anti-Party and anti-socialist, but subjectively not anti-Party or anti-socialist; he also said that he was worried that others would misunderstand his "political face." Those who criticized him unanimously denounced Xu's "self-criticism" as extremely dishonest. The many materials revealed by the critics were sufficient to prove that Xu Liangying's political face was very clear—he was a right-wing element; Xu's reactionary words and deeds were clearly intentional; Xu was an internal accomplice to the external right-wing elements attacking the Party. Speakers at the meeting unanimously demanded that Xu Liangying continue to thoroughly confess his reactionary words and deeds. Scientists who had studied in the United States cited many facts about the lack of democratic freedom for the working people in the United States to refute the bourgeois "democracy and freedom" that Xu Liangying so admired.

During the two-day meeting, many people also exposed the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of another right-wing element at the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Li Deqi. The materials revealed by everyone showed that Li Deqi's anti-Party and anti-socialist ideology had formed a system. He slandered Chairman Mao, opposed the people's masses shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao" and publishing photos in the newspapers of the people's masses cheering for Chairman Mao; he clamored to reform China's constitution, saying that the words "Communist Party leadership" could be omitted from the constitution, and advocated that socialist society should have "freedom to oppose socialism"; he advocated turning Zhongshan Park in Beijing into Hyde Park in London. He wanted anyone to be able to spread counter-revolutionary remarks there; he advocated that the power of the CPPCC should exceed the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and so on. Li Deqi was particularly keen to defend counter-revolutionaries, saying, "Why must we be ruthless to counter-revolutionaries?", advocating "benevolent governance" towards counter-revolutionaries. He said that his suppressed counter-revolutionary landlord mother had indirectly made "contributions" to the revolution because she had sent him money. He also defended these reactionary remarks, saying they were based on a "petty-bourgeois morality." Those present at the meeting pointed out that Li Deqi's reactionary remarks were actually intended to abolish the "proletarian dictatorship." After the rectification campaign began, Li Deqi, under the pretext that the mental labor of intellectuals should be combined with physical labor, went to the Baofusi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing six times to agitate the peasants. He incited the peasants not to sell vegetables to the state, saying that the state's purchase prices were "too low" and "not worthwhile for the peasants," etc., stirring up the relationship between the peasants and the state, and also inciting the peasants to "sue" the government. However, these conspiratorial activities of his did not succeed and were refuted and rejected by the peasants.

People speaking at the meeting pointed out that Li Deqi's self-criticism at the meeting mostly repeated the materials that others had already revealed. Li Deqi should confess more new materials and, in particular, honestly examine his ideological motives.

    他们在哲学研究所研究什么？
    研究破社会主义立资本主义
    许良英李德齐是党的叛徒
    新华社2日讯　中国科学院在1、2两日举行大会，揭发和斥责党内右派分子许良英、李德齐。
    哲学研究所研究人员许良英过去的许多老朋友、老同学以及同他一起工作过的同志举出大量具体材料，揭穿了许良英反对共产党、反对社会主义的政治面貌。出身于恶霸地主家庭的许良英，自1946年入党以来，每遇到个人野心遭受挫折时，即和党对立，特别是反右派斗争开始以后，他的反党、反社会主义言行更加猖獗。6月8日起，人民日报发表了反右派的社论，许看了以后咆哮如雷，要撕掉人民日报，他贩卖右派分子的谣言，胡说“党中央分裂了”，“毛主席受到高级干部宗派主义的反对，这些高级干部想报仇，太不‘德道’”；“毛主席妥协了”等等。他四出奔走点火，曾经向科学院院部、几个研究所、中央团校等十多个单位的二十多人散布对中央、对人民日报反右派社论的不满言论；向他们宣传资产阶级的所谓“民主”，鼓吹反党反社会主义的大字报。他认为党中央、领袖和任何人都不配被信任，只能相信他自己的“独立思考”。科学院党委书记对他进行教育后，他仍然坚持反社会主义反共产党的立场和观点，说要坚决反对党中央这样做法（指反右派斗争）。他扬言不惜“牺牲党籍”，并且为自己准备了两条退路：“回乡种田”或者“到资本主义国家去做‘地下工作’”。
    许良英在会上作的“检讨”中，他是客观上反党反社会主义、主观上不反党不反社会主义；他还说担心别人误会他的“政治面目”。批驳他的人同声指责许的“检讨”是极不老实的。批评者揭发的许多材料已足够证明许良英的政治面目很清楚——是右派分子；许的反动言行明明是通过主观的；许是党外右派分子向党进攻的内应。会上发言者一致要求许良英要继续彻底交代他的反动言行。留学美国的科学家举出了美国劳动人民没有民主自由的许多事实，来驳斥许良英所十分欣赏的资产阶级的“民主自由”。
    两天的会上，许多人还揭露了中国科学院哲学研究所的另一个右派分子李德齐的反党反社会主义的言行。大家揭发出来的材料说明，李德齐的反党反社会主义的思想已经形成体系。他污蔑毛主席，反对人民群众喊毛主席万岁和在报上登载人民群众向毛主席欢呼的照片；扬言要改革中国的宪法，说宪法中可以不写“共产党领导”的字样，主张社会主义社会要有“反社会主义的自由”；主张把北京的中山公园变为伦敦的海德公园。他是想让随便什么人都可以在那里散布反革命言论；他主张政协的权力应该超出人民代表大会常委会，等等。李德齐特别热衷于为反革命分子辩护，说“对反革命分子为什么一定要狠？”，主张对反革命分子要施“仁政”。他说，他的被镇压的反革命地主母亲由于给他寄过钱，因此她对革命也间接有“功”。他并且为他的这些反动言论辩护，说是出于“小资产阶级道德观”。到会的人指出，李德齐这些反动言论实际上是要取消“无产阶级专政”。李德齐在整风开始以后，借口知识分子的脑力劳动要同体力劳动相结合，先后六次到北京郊区保福寺“生产”农业社向农民点火。他鼓动农民不要把蔬菜卖给国家，说国家的收购价格“太低”、“对农民不上算”等等，挑拨农民同国家的关系，还煽动农民向政府“告状”。但是，他的这些阴谋活动没有得逞，遭到农民的驳斥和拒绝。
    会上发言的人指出，李德齐在会上作的检讨大多重复了别人已揭发出来的材料，李德齐应当多交代新的材料，特别要老实检查思想动机。
