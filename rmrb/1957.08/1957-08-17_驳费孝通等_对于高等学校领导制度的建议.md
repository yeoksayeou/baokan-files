Refuting Fei Xiaotong et al.'s "Suggestions on the Leadership System of Institutions of Higher Education"
Wang Jinding, Associate Professor, Renmin University of China

On June 17th, the Central Committee of the China Democratic League issued a "Draft (First Draft) of Our Suggestions on the Leadership System of Institutions of Higher Education." This so-called "suggestion" draft was planned and drafted by rightists such as Fei Xiaotong, Huang Yaomian, and Wu Jingchao based on the reports of the China Democratic League branches of several universities in Beijing and "opinions from other aspects." Like the "Several Opinions on Issues Related to the Scientific System" put forward by rightists such as Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang, it is also a component of the Zhang-Luo alliance's conspiracy to attack the Party and socialism. Although the "suggestion" draft was never publicly published in newspapers, judging from some of the relevant materials we have come into contact with, quite a few people in institutions of higher education have participated in the discussion of this issue, and it is not limited to members of the China Democratic League. Therefore, the ideological confusion caused by this issue, its harm and influence, must absolutely not be ignored.

The first question raised in the "suggestion" draft, which is also the most crucial issue in the conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists, is the question of "who should we rely on to run institutions of higher education well at present."

Who should we rely on to run institutions of higher education well?

To answer this question, I think it is enough to mention just one thing. As long as we think about the fact that in the thirty-six years of old China from 1912 to 1947, only 210,000 graduates from institutions of higher education were produced, while in our first five-year plan, we cultivated 280,000 graduates serving the cause of socialist construction, then it is enough to understand how great achievements China's higher education has made under the leadership of the Communist Party.

However, the rightists, disregarding the eloquent facts, groundlessly attribute the existing problems in institutions of higher education and their causes to the existence of Party organizations or the participation of Party members in the work of institutions of higher education. They even slander in the suggestion draft that many comrades in our Party have "insufficient understanding of the Party Central Committee's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals"; that they "have not grasped the characteristics of academic institutions, and mistakenly equated them with general state power organs"; that they "have not fully recognized the important role of intellectual and technical forces in modern national construction"; and that "the democratic style is insufficient, and major measures in schools are rarely discussed with the masses."

It is not difficult to understand these "crimes" that the rightists fabricated and imposed on the Party organizations and our Party comrades. Because, first, they adhere to the reactionary position of the bourgeois rightists, refuse ideological remolding, and oppose "gradually abandoning the bourgeois world outlook and establishing the proletarian and communist world outlook." They said that "the internal contradictions existing between the Party and intellectuals" cannot be resolved by "simply emphasizing the self-remolding of intellectuals" (Fei Xiaotong: "Early Spring"); they also said: "Today's method of uniting through criticism, struggle, and remolding contradicts the 'rites' of the 'superior man' that the 'scholar' expects." (Luo Longji: "Strengthening the Unity Between Party and Non-Party Intellectuals") They even openly fabricated rumors, saying that ideological remolding "is not only a disrespect for human rights, but also an insult," making them "confess under duress" (Li Jinghan), so the rightists concluded: "If one party considers the other party ideologically backward, and the other party considers this party academically ignorant, ... then the gap between 'backwardness' and 'ignorance' is difficult to eliminate." (Luo Longji: Ibid.) The meaning here is very clear: if they do not act according to the views of the bourgeois rightists, then they will resist to the end.

According to them, the Party's policy towards intellectuals can only be: to talk about unity, it must abandon the necessary criticism and struggle against them, and no longer talk about ideological remolding.

Second, they oppose taking the socialist road. The rightists do not shy away from saying that they "take the world as their responsibility." But since they are experts in guiding China (including institutions of higher education) towards capitalist development, they clamor that "experts are not in charge, and those in charge are not experts." (Zhu Qixian) They propose "the strict separation of the Party and the government...", "the Party committee should not issue orders to administrative levels." (Wu Jingchao) Otherwise, "administration is just a dotted line" (Ma Zhemin), "the Party committee is arbitrary," "cannot be seen by others," and even does not comply with "Article 17 of the Constitution" (Wu Jingchao).

However, the rightist professors completely forgot a cruel reality; forgot that after the reorganization of departments or even until today, many of them are still unable to offer courses; forgot that their set of "knowledge," before their standpoints, views, and methods have undergone fundamental changes, cannot meet the needs of training cadres for socialist construction. What "having a position without power," what "holding a position without doing any work," I think, when exposed, are nothing more than because they are still laymen in socialist universities.

But now the bourgeois rightists shamelessly play themselves as "experts," and thereby slander the Party's organization in institutions of higher education for issuing calls for political tasks, or instructions on policies and guidelines in the work of institutions of higher education, as replacing the government with the Party, and not separating the Party from the government. I think rightist Chen Yousong said it rather simply, that is: "Departments and teaching and research groups, don't need them (referring to the Party committee) to come." Thus, what "liberating" from learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to learn from the "most politically reactionary Spain" that has "things... worth learning" (Wu Jingchao), "canceling one-quarter or one-fifth of the required courses," "adding some theories outside the Marxist-Leninist system" (Wu Jingchao), have all been put forward. In short, they want to do whatever they want.

This means that their purpose is nothing more than to drag China's higher education back to the old path of colonialism. However, they beautify it as democratic school management.

They also say that canceling the Party's leadership is to strengthen the Party's leadership and that the Party organization is the leading core, just as they say that opposing Marxism-Leninism is opposing dogmatism. But on the other hand, the "suggestion" stipulates very clearly that only "the school affairs committee is the highest leading body of the school," and "all measures and personnel changes within the school must take legal effect after being passed by the school affairs committee." The role of the Party organization is limited to when the school affairs committee formulates rules and regulations, it can only state its opinions "concisely and succinctly," and is only responsible for guaranteeing and taking the lead in implementing the resolutions of the school affairs committee.

Not only that, the "suggestion" also stipulates that the members of the school affairs committee should "be predominantly professors and associate professors," which, given that "the proportion of Party members among professors is small" (Tao Dayong), is in essence also seizing the Party's leadership in institutions of higher education through this legal form of the school affairs committee.

This conspiracy of the rightists was originally not difficult to see through. However, judging from the materials of the discussions on the system of the Party committee assuming responsibility by teachers in various institutions of higher education in May, many people lost their due soberness. They were confused by Zhang-Luo and their counselors, and even acted as captives of the rightists. The reason for this is actually still that "in the depths of their souls, there is still a bourgeois or petty-bourgeois kingdom." Since the influence of bourgeois education is so deeply rooted in them, they certainly look down on workers and peasants, and will certainly follow Zhang-Luo.

This also exposes the fatal weaknesses of the so-called senior intellectuals, and shows how important and difficult ideological remolding is for intellectuals.

Therefore, although the rightists' conspiracy to usurp the Party's leadership in institutions of higher education has failed, the struggle between taking the socialist road and taking the capitalist road in institutions of higher education will continue for a considerable period of time. And teachers in institutions of higher education have the responsibility to fight to the end for the socialist cause.

    驳费孝通等“对于高等学校领导制度的建议”
    中国人民大学副教授  汪金丁
    6月17日由民盟中央办公厅发出了一份“我们对于高等学校领导制度的建议（草案初稿）”。这个所谓“建议”的草案初稿是由费孝通、黄药眠和吴景超等右派分子根据所谓北京几个大学民盟支部的汇报及“其他方面的意见”策划拟定的。它同曾昭抡、钱伟长等右派分子提出的“关于有关科学体制问题的几点意见”一样，也是章罗联盟向党、向社会主义阴谋进攻的一个组成部分。虽然“建议”的草案初稿不曾在报纸上公开发表，但从我们接触到的一些有关材料看来，高等学校里参加讨论过这一问题的人，还不在少数，并且也不限于民盟成员。因此，在这个问题上所引起的思想混乱，它的危害和影响，是绝对不容忽视的。
    “建议”的草案初稿中首先提出的，同时也是资产阶级右派阴谋中最带有关键性的问题，便是“目前要办好高等学校，究竟应该依靠谁”的问题。
    究竟应该依靠谁来办好高等学校呢？
    回答这个问题，我想只要提到一件事就够了，只要我们想想旧中国从1912到1947的三十六年间，高等学校毕业生仅二十一万人，而我们在第一个五年之内，却培养了二十八万为社会主义建设事业服务的毕业生，那么也就足够理解我国的高等教育事业在共产党的领导下，取得了多么巨大的成绩。
    然而右派分子在这个问题上，置雄辩的事实于不顾，毫无根据地把目前高等学校存在的问题及其产生原因，都归结为高等学校之有了党的组织或党员之参加了高等学校的工作。他们竟然在建议草案中诬蔑我们党内许多同志是“对于党中央的团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策认识不足”；是“没有掌握到学术机关的特点，错误地把它和一般政权机关等同起来”；是“没有充分认识到知识技术力量在近代国家建设中所起的重要作用”；并且“民主作风不够，学校中重大措施，很少和群众商量”。
    右派分子捕风捉影地加在党的组织与我们党内同志的这些“罪状”也是不难理解的。因为第一，他们坚持资产阶级右派的反动立场，拒绝思想改造，反对“逐步地抛弃资产阶级的世界观，而树立无产阶级的、共产主义的世界观。”他们说，
  “党和知识分子之间存在的内部矛盾”，不能用“单单强调知识分子的自我改造”来解决（费孝通：早春前后）；他们又说：“今天批评、斗争和改造的团结方式，同‘士’所期望的‘礼’之‘下’之是有矛盾的。”（罗隆基：加强党与非党知识分子的团结）他们甚至公然造谣，说思想改造“不仅是不尊重人权，而且是个侮辱”，使他们
  “屈打成招”（李景汉），所以右派分子由此得出结论：“倘此方认彼方为思想落后，而彼方认此方为学术外行，……那么‘落后’与‘外行’之间的隔膜，是很难消灭的。”（罗隆基：同上）这里意思很明显，如果不是按照资产阶级右派的观点行事，那么他们就要顽抗到底。
    照他们说来，党对知识分子的政策，就只能是，要讲团结，就必须放弃对他们进行应有的批评和斗争，而不能再谈思想改造。
    第二，他们反对走社会主义的道路。右派分子毫不讳言他们是“以天下为己任”的。但他们既是把中国（包括高等学校在内）导向资本主义道路发展的内行，所以他们就大肆叫嚣“内行不当家，当家的不内行。”（朱启贤）提出“要党和政……严格分开”，“党委会不对各级行政发号施令。”（吴景超）否则“行政就是一条虚线”（马哲民）”、“党委会就是独断独行”，“见不得人”，甚至是不遵照“宪法十七条所说的办法去做”（吴景超）了。
    不过右派的教授们完全忘记了一件残酷无情的事实；忘记了在院系调整后或者直到今天，他们当中有不少人还是无力开课；忘记了他们那一套“知识”，在他们的立场、观点、方法不曾发生根本性的变化之前，是不能适应培养社会主义建设事业干部的需要的。说什么“有职无权”呀，什么“尸位素餐”呀，我看揭穿了也不外因为他们在社会主义大学里还是外行而已。
    但现在资产阶级的右派分子却无耻地把自己扮演成“内行”的角色，并由此而诬蔑党的组织在高等学校里发布政治任务的号召，或有关高等学校工作中的方针政策的指示，便是以党代政，是党政不分。我以为右派分子陈友松说得倒还干脆，那就是：“系和教研组，不要他们（指党委）来。”于是，什么要从学习苏联的先进经验中“解放出来”，去学习“政治上最反动的西班牙”的“可供……学习之处”呀，（吴景超）“取消四分之一或五分之一的必修课”，“加添一些马列主义系统以外的理论”呀，（吴景超）都提出来了，总之他们要为所欲为。
    这也就是说，他们的目的不外是把我国的高等教育拖回到殖民地的老路上去。然而他们却美其名为民主办校。
    他们也同把反对马克思列宁主义说成是反对教条主义一样，把取消党的领导，说成是党的领导应当加强，党的组织是领导核心。但另一方面“建议”里却规定得很清楚，只有“校务委员会是学校的最高领导机关”，“学校内的一切措施和人事变动，必须经过校委会的通过才能发生法律效果”。党组织的作用被限制在校务委员会制定规章制度的时候，只能“精简扼要”地陈述自己的意见，只能对校务委员会的决议，负责保证，带头执行。
    不只如此，“建议”里还规定校务委员会的成员，“教授和副教授应占多数”，这在估计到“党员在教授中的比重小”（陶大镛）的情况之下，实质上也就是通过了校务委员会的这种合法的形式，篡夺党在高等学校的领导权。
    右派分子的这种阴谋，本来是不难识破的。然而从5月中各地高等学校教师在讨论党委负责制这一问题的材料看来，不少人却失掉了应有的清醒，他们受章罗及其谋士的迷惑，甚至充当了右派的俘虏。这原因其实也仍不外是自己“灵魂的深处还有一个资产阶级或小资产阶级的王国。”资产阶级教育的影响，对他们既是那么根深蒂固，他们当然看不起工人和农民，也当然会跟着章罗走。
    这里也就暴露了所谓高级知识分子的致命的弱点，并且说明了思想改造对于知识分子的是多么的重要又是多么的艰难。
    因此，右派篡夺党在高等学校领导权的阴谋虽然破产了，可是在高等学校里走社会主义的道路还是走资本主义道路的斗争，还要在相当长的时间里继续进行。而高等学校的教师，是有责任为社会主义事业奋斗到底的。
