Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Recently, large numbers of this year's middle and primary school graduates across the country have gone to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. In Sichuan Province, more than 300,000 of this year's middle and primary school graduates whose families are in the countryside have returned to the countryside, and they are currently engaged in intensive autumn harvesting, autumn planting, and other field work and household chores in agricultural cooperatives. Among the more than 30,000 this year's middle and primary school graduates whose families are in towns, several hundred have also gone to the countryside collectively or independently to participate in agricultural labor. According to preliminary statistics in Anhui Province, more than 80,000 of this year's middle and primary school graduates who could not continue their studies have been properly resettled, most of whom have participated in agricultural production. In Tongcheng County alone, more than 1,800 graduates have happily taken up agricultural production positions. In Shucheng and Dongliu counties, more than 2,000 graduates have also participated in agricultural production. According to statistics from Xiangtan Special District in Hunan Province alone, more than 4,600 of this year's middle and primary school graduates have gone to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, accounting for about 65% of the total number of this year's middle and primary school graduates in the area. In Beijing, about 4,000 of this year's senior and junior high school graduates whose families are in the countryside have returned to their hometowns to participate in production. Many of them returned to the countryside with their luggage to participate in agricultural production without applying for universities or high schools after graduation. In Guangzhou, after the results of the entrance examination for ordinary middle schools were announced on August 7, many graduates who failed to pass the exam also expressed their desire to go to the countryside to participate in production. In Wuhan, Jinan, Shenyang and other places, in early August, there were also three to four hundred of this year's middle and primary school graduates and young intellectuals from society who set off to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

Currently, the number of this year's middle and primary school graduates who are preparing to participate in agricultural production in the countryside is still increasing. In Shenyang, as of August 4, according to statistics from only seven schools, 204 people have registered to prepare to participate in production in the countryside, and they will soon go to the countryside one after another. Many of this year's middle and primary school graduates whose families are in the cities in Hunan Province are also signing up to request to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

After this year's middle and primary school graduates arrived in the countryside, they were warmly welcomed and cared for by the local district, township party committees and governments, as well as agricultural cooperatives. The agricultural cooperatives assigned them appropriate work based on the graduates' physical condition, education level, and the actual needs of the agricultural cooperatives. In some areas of Sichuan Province, reasonable regulations have also been made on the graduates' food rations, private plots, and other issues. For younger graduates, they are also helped to arrange household chores, and are led to organize after-school tutoring classes to learn production knowledge and prepare to participate in labor production in the future. In order to give play to the specialties of middle and primary school graduates, Nanbu County in Sichuan Province is also preparing to set up agricultural accounting and agricultural technology spare-time schools in towns to recruit more than 6,500 of this year's middle and primary school graduates who are participating in agricultural production to study financial management and production technologies such as sericulture, orchards, animal husbandry, and forestry. Many farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan believe that the large number of students going to the countryside to engage in agricultural production is an unprecedented happy event, so township and commune cadres and members go to the district graduate office every day to inquire about the exact date of the students going to the countryside.

Because many areas have done a good job of ideological work in advance, this time the graduates can generally eat, live, and work with the farmers after going to the countryside, and are welcomed by the farmers. Some graduates have also humbly established a teacher-student relationship with old farmers, and have therefore made good achievements in production. Yang Erfu, a graduate of a senior primary school in Yingshan County, Sichuan Province, has been re-elected as a member representative of the agricultural cooperative where he is located because of his good labor. The 18 graduates of this year from Beijing No. 19 Middle School who returned to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Shijingshan District to participate in agricultural production are often praised by the agricultural cooperative because they can endure hardship and take good care of the livestock in the cooperative.

    全国各地大批中、小学毕业生
    到农村去　参加生产　安家立户
    新华社11日讯　全国各地最近又有大批本届中、小学毕业生到农村参加农业生产。四川省已有三十多万家在农村的本届中、小学毕业生回到农村，目前他们正在农业社进行紧张的秋收、秋种等田间劳动和家务劳动。家在城镇的三万多名本届中、小学毕业生中，也有几百人集体或自行下乡参加了农业劳动。安徽省据初步统计，已经有八万多名不能升学的本届中、小学毕业生得到了妥善安置，其中大部分人参加了农业生产。仅桐城县就有一千八百多名毕业生愉快地走上了农业生产岗位。舒城和东流两县也有两千多名毕业生参加了农业生产。湖南省仅据湘潭专区统计，已有四千六百多名本届中、小学毕业生先后下乡参加了农业生产，约占当地本届中、小学毕业生总数的65％。北京市家在农村回乡参加生产的本届高中和初中毕业生，约有四千人。其中有不少人是毕业以后没有报考大学或高中，就带着行李回到农村参加农业生产的。广州市8月7日在普通中学升学考试发榜以后，也有许多没有考取的本届毕业生表示要到农村参加生产，武汉、济南、沈阳等地在8月上旬也有三、四百名本届中、小学毕业生和社会知识青年，出发到农村参加农业生产。
    目前，各地准备到农村参加农业生产的本届中、小学毕业生的人数还在不断增加。沈阳市到8月4日为止，仅据七个学校统计，报名准备到农村参加生产的已有二百零四人，他们不久也将陆续前往农村。湖南省家在城市的许多本届中、小学毕业生，也正纷纷报名要求到农村去参加农业生产。
    各地的本届中、小学毕业生到达农村以后，受到了当地区、乡党和政府以及农业社的热情欢迎和照顾。农业社根据毕业生的身体和文化等条件，结合农业社的实际需要，分配给他们适当的工作。四川省有些地区对毕业生的口粮、自留地等问题，也作出了合理的规定。对年龄较小的毕业生，也帮助他们安排家务劳动，并领导他们组织业余补习班，学习生产知识，准备以后再参加劳动生产。为了发挥中、小学毕业生的特长，四川省南充县还准备以乡为单位，举办农业会计和农业技术业余学校，招收六千五百多名参加农业生产的本届中、小学毕业生，学习财务管理和蚕桑、果园、畜牧、林业等生产技术。武汉市郊区的许多农民认为大批学生下乡从事农业生产是从来未有过的大喜事，因此成天都有乡、社干部和社员到区毕业生办公室打听学生下乡的准确日期。
    由于许多地区事先思想工作做得比较好，这次毕业生下乡后一般都能同农民同吃、同住、同劳动，受到农民欢迎。有的毕业生还虚心地同老农民结了师徒关系，因而在生产中做出了良好的成绩。四川省营山县的高小毕业生杨尔福因为劳动好，已被他所在的农业社补选为社员代表。北京市第十九中学回到石景山区中苏友好农业社参加农业生产的十八名本届毕业生，由于能吃苦耐劳，爱护社里的牲畜，时常受到农业社的表扬。
