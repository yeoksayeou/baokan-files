　　Colluding with Chu Anping and Peng Zigang to Stir up Trouble Everywhere
　　Anti-Party Element Xu Ying Wants the World in Chaos

　　(Our newspaper dispatch) Following the exposure of right-wing elements within the Party, Wang Tan and Long Chunzhang, the Central Senior Party School of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a series of general meetings of all students to expose and criticize another right-wing element within the Party at the school, Xu Ying, a student in the ordinary class and the former Deputy Director of the State Council Religious Affairs Bureau, for his anti-Party words and deeds.

　　During the period when bourgeois right-wing elements were rampant in attacking the Party, Xu Ying wanted the world in chaos and "always wanted to make a name for himself." He colluded with right-wing elements such as Chu Anping, Peng Zigang, and Pu Xixiu, stirring up trouble everywhere and coordinating internally and externally to attack the Party. Xu Ying vigorously peddled a large number of bourgeois reactionary news viewpoints, attacked the Party's news work, and conspired to usurp the Party's news work positions. Xu Ying smeared that our country does not have "freedom of the press," complaining that "Party committee review and Party group discussions affect the publication, distribution, and sales of newspapers." Therefore, he advocated "striving for freedom of the press," which is asking the proletariat for bourgeois freedom, and asking the Party and the people for anti-Party and anti-people freedom. He said, "News is news," "Don't be afraid of one-sidedness." He also vigorously advocated "running colleagues' newspapers," and that "newspapers can be jointly owned by public and private entities, or they can be privately owned." Xu Ying also felt sorry for Chu Anping, Xu Zhucheng, and others, saying that our Party does not "respect journalists." He said that he wanted to speak from a "reporter's standpoint," and therefore actively used the "Zuo Ye incident" and conspired with his wife, Peng Zigang (an anti-Party right-wing element), to attack the Party.

　　Xu Ying and Chu Anping were sworn brothers. In the eleven weeks from March to June, he spent nine Sundays with Chu Anping discussing how to tamper with the political direction of the Guangming Daily; how to attack the Party; and after the anti-rightist struggle began, they jointly discussed how to retreat. Xu Ying suggested to Chu Anping that the Guangming Daily establish a "small number of editorial board members centered on Fei Xiaotong." Chu accepted this suggestion and indeed established an "advisory group" including Fei Xiaotong, Qian Weichang, and Xu Ying. He also guided Chu Anping on how to write editorials and news, and jointly studied the personnel arrangements of the Guangming Daily. Xu Ying's enthusiasm for the Guangming Daily was aimed at using the Guangming Daily to unite the democratic parties and compete with the Communist Party for the country. After the anti-rightist struggle began, Xu Ying went to Chu Anping's home twice to establish an offensive and defensive alliance with him, and asked him to pretend to be active and make false self-criticisms.

　　Xu Ying also had close relationships with right-wing elements Peng Zigang, Fei Xiaotong, Pu Xixiu, and others. The editorial "Respect News Reporters" written by Peng Zigang for Wenhui Daily using the "Zuo Ye incident" was discussed with Xu Ying in advance. This editorial was actually a general mobilization order for attacking the Party on the news front. Xu Ying hated Communist Party members, Party cadres, especially veteran cadres. Inside the Party School, Xu Ying attacked the Party School for having a "very bad school spirit," saying that the Party's senior cadres were all "rude and uncultured," "degenerate and corrupt." He also repeatedly attacked the school for being "dogmatic," "not solving problems," saying that "Principal Yang only scolds idealism as 'yellow ghosts and green ghosts' without solving problems, Ai Siqi is dogmatic, and the teaching and research office is misleading people"; he also attacked the school for having serious sectarianism, with the aim of setting fires within the school and using this to shift the focus of the anti-rightist struggle.

　　After Xu Ying's anti-Party crimes were exposed and criticized by all the students, he still refused to repent and did not honestly confess everything. The students of the Party School all expressed that they would fight him to the end and would never allow him to muddle through.

　  勾结储安平彭子冈到处煽风点火
　　反党分子徐盈唯恐天下不乱
    本报讯　继党内右派分子王谭、龙纯璋被揭露之后，中共中央高级党校最近连续召开全体学员大会，揭露和批判该校另一个党内右派分子、普通班学员、原国务院宗教事务管理局副局长徐盈的反党言行。
    在资产阶级右派分子猖狂向党进攻期间，徐盈唯恐天下不乱，“总想搞出点名堂来”。他和右派分子储安平、彭子冈、浦熙修等串通一气，到处煽风点火，里应外合地向党进攻。徐盈极力贩卖大量的资产阶级的反动新闻观点，攻击党的新闻工作，阴谋篡夺党的新闻工作阵地。徐盈污蔑我们国家没有“新闻自由”，埋怨“党委审查，党组讨论，影响报纸出版发行及销路”。因此，他主张“争取新闻自由”，就是向无产阶级要资产阶级的自由，向党向人民要反党反人民的自由。他说：“新闻就是新闻”，“不要怕片面性”。他还极力主张“办同人报”，“报纸可以是公私合营，也可以是私营”。徐盈还对储安平、徐铸成等抱不平，说我们党不“尊重报人”，他说他要站在“记者立场”说话，因此，积极利用“左叶事件”与他的妻子彭子冈（党内右派分子）合谋向党进攻。
    徐盈和储安平是生死弟兄。在三月到六月的十一个星期中，他有九个星期日和储安平在一起商议如何篡改光明日报的政治方向；如何向党进攻；反右派斗争开始后，又共同会商怎样退却的问题。徐盈向储安平建议光明日报成立一个“人数不多、以费孝通为中心的社评委员会”，储接受了这个建议，果然建立了一个包括费孝通、钱伟长、徐盈在内的“顾问团”。他还指导储安平如何写社论，写新闻，并且共同研究了光明日报的人事安排。徐盈对光明日报这样热心的目的是想利用光明日报来团结各民主党派，与共产党争天下。反右派斗争开始后，徐盈又两次到储安平家中去，和他订立攻守同盟，并要他伪装积极，作假检讨。
    徐盈和右派分子彭子冈、费孝通、浦熙修等关系也很密切。彭子冈利用“左叶事件”为文汇报所写的“尊重新闻记者”的社论事先就和徐盈商议过。这篇社论实际上是新闻战线上向党进攻的总动员令。徐盈恨的是共产党员、党的干部特别是老干部。在党校里面，徐盈攻击党校“校风甚坏”，说党的高级干部都是“粗暴不文”、“堕落腐化”。他并数次攻击学校是“教条主义”，“不解决问题”，说“杨校长只骂唯心主义是‘黄鬼绿鬼’不解决问题，艾思奇是教条主义，教研室是误人子弟”；他又攻击学校有严重的宗派主义，目的是想在校内放火，借此转移反右派斗争的锋芒。
    徐盈的这些反党罪行受到全体学员的揭露和批判后，仍然拒不悔改，没有老老实实地全部交代。党校学员都表示要向他斗争到底，决不许他蒙混过关。
