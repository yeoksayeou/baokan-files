　　When the Masses Cheered "Long Live the Communist Party," He Shouted Wildly "Long Live the Kuomintang":
　　Guo Zhongkui Summoned the Soul of Chiang Kai-shek's Rule
　　(Our dispatch) The Henan Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee recently held a symposium to preliminarily expose the reactionary crimes of Guo Zhongkui, one of the major rightists in Henan Province.
　　Guo Zhongkui was a representative of the Henan Provincial People's Congress, a member of the Provincial People's Committee, and the director of the Provincial People's Committee's Counselor's Office. It has been revealed that Guo Zhongkui has always been a skilled anti-communist and even attempted to restore Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule after liberation. At mass rallies, when people shouted "Long Live the People's Republic of China" and "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party," he took the opportunity to shout wildly: "Long Live the Republic of China" and "Long Live the Chinese Kuomintang." In order to compete with the Communist Party, he had already colluded with rightists Liu Jixue, Li Jingzhi, Liu Xicheng, Song Yuxiu, and others, attempting to turn the Henan provincial and municipal organizations of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee into reactionary tools. He also attempted to "support Liu Jixue as vice governor or chief procurator of the provincial government" in order to cover up his reactionary face. In addition, he wooed Zhao Dapu, a major general staff officer of Sun Lianzhong's army, who had participated in the five encirclements and suppressions of the Jiangxi Central Revolutionary Base, to be responsible for the preparatory work for the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee organization in Xinxiang City in order to expand his sphere of influence.
　　Guo Zhongkui also wantonly slandered and attacked the political movements led by the Communist Party. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the "paper tiger" face of American imperialism had been completely exposed, but Guo Zhongkui flatly denied it. Regarding land reform, he advocated "peaceful land reform, no struggle" and encouraged Liu Jixue to resist land reform and rise up in "revolution." He said to Liu Jixue: "If you don't make a revolution, people will make a revolution against you! Go back and see!" In Henan Province, a counter-revolutionary named Wang Youmei, who was guilty of numerous blood debts, was suppressed according to law; however, Guo Zhongkui was very dissatisfied and shouted wildly that he wanted to "purge all special agents!"
　　After the Party's rectification movement began, Guo Zhongkui's anti-communist activities became even more rampant, even to the point of not eating, collecting and manufacturing poisonous bullets everywhere, and plotting with members of his reactionary group in secret chambers.
　　Guo Zhongkui's open summoning of the soul for Chiang Kai-shek and his hostility towards the Communist Party and socialism had historical roots. Originally, he was a backbone member of the CC Clique very early on, and during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he also joined the military intelligence (Juntong) secret service organization and served as Chiang Kai-shek's puppet Yubei Commissioner and Security Commander, not resisting Japan, but specializing in anti-communism. Later, Chiang Kai-shek personally met with him in Chongqing and bestowed upon him the high-ranking official position of Inspector of Henan and Shandong. When Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan, he also appointed Guo as the puppet inspector of Taiwan.

### 群众高呼“共产党万岁”他就狂叫“国民党万岁”　郭仲隗为蒋介石统治招魂

　　群众高呼“共产党万岁”他就狂叫“国民党万岁”
　　郭仲隗为蒋介石统治招魂
    本报讯　民革河南省委近日举行座谈会，初步揭发了河南省主要右派分子之一郭仲隗的反动罪行。
    郭仲隗是河南省人民代表大会代表、省人民委员会委员、省人民委员会参事室主任。据揭露，郭仲隗是一贯反共的能手，解放后还妄图恢复蒋介石的反动统治。在群众集会上，人们高呼“中华人民共和国万岁”、“中国共产党万岁”的时候，他就乘机狂叫：“中华民国万岁”、“中国国民党万岁”。为了和共产党分庭抗礼，他早就和右派分子刘积学、李静之、刘希程、宋聿修等勾结一起，企图把民革河南省市组织都变成反动工具。他还企图“捧刘积学作省政府副主席或检察长”，以便掩护其反动面目。另外，他还拉拢曾经参加过五次围剿江西中央革命根据地的孙连仲部少将参谋长赵大璞，负责筹建新乡市的民革组织工作，以扩大其势力范围。
    对于共产党领导的历次政治运动，郭仲隗也大肆诋毁攻击。在抗美援朝运动时，美帝国主义“纸老虎”面目已彻底暴露，但郭仲隗却一口否定。对于土地改革，他主张“和平土改，不要斗争”，并鼓动刘积学抗拒土改，起来“革命”。他对刘积学说：“你不革命，人家要革你的命！你回去看看！”河南省有个血债累累的反革命王友梅，依法被镇压了；但郭仲隗却很不服气，并狂叫要“肃清一切反特分子！”
    党的整风运动开始以后，郭仲隗的反共活动更加猖狂，甚至连饭也不吃，到处搜集和制造毒弹，并与其反动集团的成员策划于密室。
    郭仲隗所以公然替蒋介石招尸唤魂，敌视共产党和社会主义，是有其历史根源的。原来他很早就是CC的骨干分子，在抗日战争时期又参加了军统特务组织，并充任蒋介石的伪豫北专员兼保安司令，不抗日，专反共。以后，蒋介石在重庆又亲自接见了他，并赐给他豫、鲁监察使的高官。蒋介石在逃亡台湾的时候，还任命郭为台湾的伪监察使。
