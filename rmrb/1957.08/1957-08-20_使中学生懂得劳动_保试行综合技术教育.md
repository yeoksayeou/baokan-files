Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 19th: According to the Bulgarian newspaper "People's Youth," the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers have decided to pilot comprehensive technical education in some general schools starting from the 1957-1958 academic year. Simultaneously, labor education content will be increased in the teaching of other schools.

The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers, at a joint meeting held not long ago, listened to the report by Vulko Chervenkov, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Education and Culture, on "Further Development of Education in Bulgaria," and made corresponding resolutions.

The meeting considered that Bulgaria's education had greatly developed after liberation, but the main shortcoming was that education lagged behind the needs of the current socialist construction. In general, education and cultivation were not sufficiently integrated with production practice.

Bulgaria has 16,000 to 17,000 middle school graduates every year, about one-third of whom enter universities, while the remaining two-thirds are mostly not accustomed to or interested in manual labor, making it difficult for them to choose jobs. The meeting decided to gradually implement comprehensive technical education to enable middle school graduates to possess the necessary labor skills and experience, and be able to easily choose a profession.

In terms of higher education, Bulgaria now trains approximately 4,500 specialized talents each year. The meeting pointed out that the main task of higher education is to closely link teaching with practice, and emphasized opposition to the attitude of neglecting political courses and communist education in universities, criticizing the argument that one can be an expert without studying philosophy.

The meeting decided to immediately establish Party grassroots organizations in all schools with the necessary number of Party members, and pointed out that the school Party organizations must raise the struggle against manifestations of bourgeois ideology to a high level.

### 使中学生懂得劳动  保试行综合技术教育

    使中学生懂得劳动
    保试行综合技术教育
    据新华社索非亚19日电　据保加利亚“人民青年报”报道，保共中央和部长会议已经决定从1957—1958学年起，在一部分普通学校里试行综合技术教育，同时在其他学校的教学中增加一些劳动教育的内容。
    保共中央和部长会议在不久以前举行的一次联席会议上，听取了部长会议副主席兼教育和文化部长契尔文科夫关于“进一步发展保加利亚的教育”的报告，并且作出了相应的决议。
    这次会议认为，保加利亚的教育事业在解放后有了很大的发展，但是主要缺点是教育落后于当前社会主义建设的需要。一般说来，教育和教养同生产实践结合不够。
    保加利亚每年有一万六、七千名中学毕业生，其中有三分之一左右升入高等学校，而其余三分之二的人大部分对体力劳动不习惯和不感兴趣，因而选择工作感到困难。这次会议决定逐步推行综合技术教育就是为了使中学毕业生具备必要的劳动技能和经验，能够容易选择职业。
    在高等教育方面，现在保加利亚每年培养出约四千五百名专门人材。这次会议指出，高等教育的主要任务是教学同实践密切联系起来，并且强调反对轻视高等学校中的政治课和共产主义教育的态度，批判了那种认为不学哲学也可以当专家的论调。
    会议决定立即在一切具有必要的党员人数的学校里建立党的基层组织，并且指出，学校党组织必须把反对资产阶级思想意识表现的斗争提到高度水平。
