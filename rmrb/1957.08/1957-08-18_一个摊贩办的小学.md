    A Primary School Run by a Street Vendor
    By our reporter Wu Erxiang
    The Zhong District Street Vendor Children's Primary School in Guangzhou is currently the only primary school in Guangzhou founded by street vendors themselves. The school now has three classes (grades one, two, and three) with a total of 168 students. It also has an attached street vendor's evening school, mainly to meet the cultural learning needs of adult street vendors, which also has 174 students.

    This school has been around for several years since its establishment. Its predecessor was the Renchang Street Street Vendor Youth Study Class, which was founded in 1951 by the Renchang Street Office.

    The study class ran for about a year. By the end of 1952, as more and more street vendors wanted to learn to read, it was moved to its current location—a two-story building in Baoshun Street Third Alley, which is also the office of the Zhong District Street Vendor Twelfth Joint Association. At that time, this place was the office of the Joint Association during the day, and it became a classroom at night. The name of the study class was changed to Zhong District Street Vendor Twelfth Joint Association Literacy Class, directly under the leadership of the Zhong District Street Vendor Twelfth Joint Association. In the second half of 1953, due to the shortage of public primary schools at that time, many street vendors' children could not enter schools, so they requested that this literacy class add a children's class to solve the learning difficulties of their children. The school was run by themselves, and they could do whatever they wanted. It was approved at once at a Joint Association committee meeting. Later, the literacy class was divided into two parts, one was the day class, which was the children's class; the other was the night class, which was the adult street vendor's after-school cultural class. As the grassroots organizations of street vendors in the Zhong District underwent two reorganizations, the school also changed its name twice, once to "Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association Fourteenth Working Committee Literacy Class"; in 1956, the Fourteenth Working Committee was abolished, and the Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association directly led the school, the children's class was renamed "Zhong District Street Vendor Children's Primary School"; the night class was renamed "Zhong District Street Vendor Eighth After-School School."

    In the early days of the school, it was completely voluntary. Neither the children's class nor the adult cultural class charged fees; teachers were street vendors with a certain level of education who volunteered. In 1954, as the number of students gradually increased, the school gradually became more standardized, and with the addition of two full-time teachers, fees were introduced. However, the fees were very low, with the children's class only charging three yuan per semester; the after-school cultural class charged only two yuan. Students with difficulties could apply for free admission or pay in installments. Recently, in order to reduce the burden on the street vendor community, the after-school cultural class decided not to charge fees again.

    The street vendors are very satisfied with this school they founded. Most of the street vendors living near Baoshun Street send their children to this school to study; they also actively participate in after-school cultural learning. Many street vendors are fathers and sons in the same school, with the son in primary school and the father in night school. They care about the school, and they actively help solve any difficulties the school may have. For example, in the early days of the school, when there was nothing, they took the initiative to raise more than 200 yuan for the school to use; when the school's tables, benches, and other furniture were insufficient, students brought their own tables and benches to class; some street vendors donated their surplus tables and benches to the school for long-term use. When something in the school was broken, they would help repair it.

    The school's equipment also costs very little to buy; most of it is collected by the grassroots organizations of the Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association. For example, the school building was originally the office of the Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association Fourteenth Working Committee. Initially, the downstairs was the office of the Working Committee, and the upstairs was used as the school's classrooms. Later, the Working Committee was abolished, and the Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association allocated the Working Committee's office and most of its office equipment to the school. The Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association originally had more than 20 grassroots organizations, and after a reorganization, about ten were abolished, leaving a large amount of materials, and anything the school could use was also allocated to them. In addition, the broken ping-pong tables, door panels, and other waste materials from the various grassroots organizations were also collected and sent to the school; and the carpenters who originally repaired equipment for the grassroots organizations of the Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association were asked to help the school process these waste materials slightly and turn them into useful things. For example, a broken ping-pong table was transformed into two or three tables for students to use in class. The school now has more than 100 tables and benches, a dozen blackboards, two clocks, and many books and recreational supplies, most of which were collected or processed from waste materials.

    The school's funding mainly comes from tuition fees, with the Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association providing subsidies for any shortfalls. The school's equipment, teaching aids, rent, water, and electricity costs are basically covered by the Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association. In reality, the school's expenses are only the salaries of the teaching staff. After 1954, when the school had two full-time teachers, it began to charge students fees and provide teachers with a certain level of compensation. At that time, a teacher's monthly salary was about 20 yuan, and the tuition income could basically cover it. By 1956, the number of full-time teachers had increased to four, and the salary had increased from the original 20 yuan to about 40 yuan, while the fees for the after-school school had been abolished. Thus, a monthly subsidy of more than 70 yuan was needed for teachers' salaries, plus rent and utilities (about 90 yuan per month), with the annual subsidy not exceeding 2,000 yuan. The Zhong District Street Vendor Joint Association receives at least 3,000 yuan in membership fees each month after deducting daily expenses, and it is not a problem to extract more than 100 yuan from it each month to subsidize the school.

    It is not easy for a youth study class with only more than 30 students to develop into a regular school of this size. This not only reflects the urgent demand of the masses for education, but also demonstrates the power of the masses in running schools. They have played a certain role in assisting the government in solving the learning problems of young people and children. However, since the establishment of this school, the relevant departments have not paid enough attention and assistance to it. Except for the after-school school, which is occasionally visited because it has the nature of literacy campaigns, no one has ever paid attention to the children's primary school. The school's teachers have repeatedly asked the Guangzhou Municipal Education Department to give them some guidance, but each time it has been like a stone sinking into the sea, with no response. Now, not only do the school's teachers not have the opportunity to participate in political and professional learning, but the students also do not have the right to participate in the Young Pioneers. It is hoped that these issues can be properly resolved.

    一个摊贩办的小学
    本报记者  吴尔祥
    广州市中区摊贩子弟小学，是广州市目前唯一的一所由摊贩自己创办的小学校。现在这个学校共有三个班（一、二、三年级），一百六十八名学生；另外还附设一个摊贩业余学校，主要是满足成年摊贩学习文化的要求，也有一百七十四名学生。
    这个学校从创办以来，已经有好几年了。它的前身是仁长街摊贩青年学习班，那是在1951年由仁长街办事处创办的。
    这个学习班办了一年左右，到1952年底，由于要求学文化的摊贩越来越多，就搬到现在这个校舍——宝顺大街三巷一座有两层楼的楼房，也是中区摊贩第十二联合会的办公地方。当时，这儿白天是联合会的办公室，晚上就变成了课堂。那时学习班的名称已改为中区摊贩第十二联合会识字班，直接属于中区摊贩第十二联合会领导。到1953年下半年，当时由于公立小学少，许多摊贩的子弟进不了学校，就要求这个识字班加办一个儿童班，解决他们子弟学习的困难。自己办的学校，要办什么就办什么，在一次联合会的委员会会议上，一下就通过了。以后，识字班就分做两部分，一部分是日班，就是儿童班；一部分是夜班，就是成年摊贩业余文化班。由于中区摊贩的基层组织经过两次改组，学校也改了两次名称，一次改为“中区摊贩联合会第十四工作委员会识字班”；1956年，撤销了第十四工作委员会的机构，中区摊贩联合会就把这个学校直接领导了起来，儿童班改名为“中区摊贩子弟小学”；夜班改名为“中区摊贩第八业余学校”。
    学校开办初期，完全是义务性的。不论是儿童班或是成年文化班，都不收费；教师由具有一定文化程度的摊贩义务担任。到了1954年，由于学生逐渐增加，学校也逐渐正规化起来，同时又有了两个专任教师，才开始收费。但收费很低，儿童班一个学期只收三元；业余文化班只收二元。有困难的学生还可以申请免费或分期交费。最近为了减轻摊贩群众的负担，业余文化班又决定不收费。
    摊贩们对自己创办的这个学校感到很满意。住在宝顺大街附近的大部分摊贩都把自己的孩子送到这个学校来学习；他们也积极参加业余学校学文化。许多摊贩都是父子同在一个学校，儿子读小学，父亲读夜校。他们很关心学校，学校有什么困难，他们都主动地帮助解决。比如学校创办初期，什么都没有，他们就主动凑集了二百多元给学校使用；学校的台、凳等家具不够用，学生上课就自己带台、凳来；有的摊贩家里有多余的台、凳，就主动地捐送给学校长期使用。学校什么东西用坏了，他们看到了就帮助修理。
    学校的设备，也是很少花钱去买，大部分都是由中区摊贩联合会各基层组织凑集起来的。比如校舍，原来是中区摊贩联合会第十四工委会的办公室。开始，楼下是工委会的办公室，楼上就做为学校的课室。以后，工委会取消了，中区摊贩联合会就把这个工会的办公室连同大部分办公用具，都拨给学校使用。中区摊贩联合会原来下面有二十多个基层组织，以后经过一次改组，撤销了十来个，剩下大批的物资，学校用得着的，也都拨给他们了。此外，各基层组织用坏了的乒乓台、门板和其他废料，也都收集起来，送给学校；并让原来替中区摊贩联合会各基层组织修理器具的木工，帮助学校把这些废料，稍稍加工，做成了有用的东西。如把一张坏了的乒乓台，改造成二张至三张学生上课用的台子。现在学校共有一百多张台、凳，十来块黑板，两个时钟和许多图书、文娱用品，大部分都是这样凑集起来或是利用废料加工成的。
    学校的经费，主要靠学费收入，不足的则由中区摊贩联合会补助。这个学校的校具、教具以及房租、水电等费用，基本上都由中区摊贩联合会包下了。实际上学校经费开支只剩下教职员的工资一项了。1954年以后，由于学校有了两个专任教师，才开始向学生收费，并给教师一定的待遇，当时一个教师每月工资大约在二十元左右，学费收入基本上可以应付。到1956年，专任教师增加到四个，工资也由原来的二十元提高到四十元左右，而业余学校的收费又取消了，这样每月教师工资需要补助七十多元，加上房租、水电费（每月约九十元），全年补助不超过二千元。中区摊贩联合会，每个月所收到的会员费，除日常开支外，至少有三千元以上的结余，每个月从中抽出一百多元来补助学校，还不成问题。
    一个由原来只有三十多个学生的青年学习班，发展到现在这样规模的正规的学校是不容易的。这不但反映了群众入学的迫切要求，也表现了群众办学的力量。他们在协助政府解决青、少年的学习问题上，是起了一定作用的。但是这个学校从创办至今，有关部门对它的重视和帮助是不够的，除了业余学校，因为带有扫盲性质，还偶然有人来看看外，子弟小学却始终没有人过问。学校的教师曾经一再要求广州市的教育部门给他们一些指导，但每次都石沉海底，毫无回音。现在，这个学校不但教师没有参加政治、业务学习的机会；而且学生也没有参加少先队的权利。这些问题希望能够好好解决。
