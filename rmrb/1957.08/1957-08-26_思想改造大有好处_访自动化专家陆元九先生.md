　　Ideological Remolding is Greatly Beneficial
　　——An Interview with Automation Expert Mr. Lu Yuanjiu
　　By our reporter Cai Jianyuan

　　In a quiet room at the Institute of Automation and Remote Control of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I interviewed Mr. Lu Yuanjiu, who had recently returned from the United States. Our conversation began with Mr. Lu recounting his eagerness to return to the motherland while in the United States and the unreasonable obstruction he encountered from the U.S. authorities.

　　Mr. Lu went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States in 1945 to pursue graduate studies. He received a doctorate in Instrumentation Engineering in 1949, and then worked at MIT for five years. From 1954 until his return to China in 1956, he researched the control problems of gas turbine engines at the Ford Motor Company. He said he had planned to return to China long ago, but the U.S. government's various obstructions of Chinese students returning home after the founding of New China delayed his return until last year. During this period, the U.S. government used various methods to prevent him from returning, whether it was being summoned by the "Immigration Bureau" of the Department of Justice or being interrogated by the "Federal Bureau of Investigation" (American Secret Service). They asked questions such as "If a war breaks out between China and the United States, which side would you oppose?" They were not satisfied with interrogating the students themselves; they also frequently inquired with the neighbors next door. At the same time, the U.S. government constantly propagated to the students that "returning to Communist China would mean being locked up in concentration camps and having no freedom of movement," etc. They especially promoted the idea of "Brain-Washing" upon returning. Mr. Lu said, "But no matter how they propagandize, the students miss their motherland and their determination to return home is unwavering." He paused and added, "However, there were also concerns in my mind. Before returning, I thought that after returning, I would not engage in politics, and as long as I focused on my professional work, there would be no problems."

　　He said that what Americans call "brainwashing" refers to our ideological remolding. American propaganda also said that people who return to China cannot think or speak freely. But Mr. Lu used his experiences after returning home to refute the enemy's slander.

　　From the moment I stepped onto the shores of the motherland, new things constantly entered my mind, broadening my horizons.

　　Mr. Lu returned to Beijing in June last year and was assigned to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in early July, starting work on August 1st. After about ten days, he went to the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Changchun to understand the situation, as part of the work there was to be merged into the Institute of Automation and Remote Control. He then participated in the preparatory work for the establishment of the institute, remaining busy for more than two months. In December, he accompanied the Chinese Academy of Sciences' delegation to the Soviet Union to study the situation of automation research, and only returned from the Soviet Union in early March of this year. In April, he also participated in receiving Soviet experts. By May, more standardized professional work began. "A year has passed so quickly since returning home!" He said that since returning, he only felt that from the day he transferred from Hong Kong to Guangzhou and stepped onto the shores of the motherland, his mind had constantly been filled with new things he did not know, things he could not have imagined while abroad, as if his mind had been broadened. He said that perhaps this could be called "brainwashing."

　　Mr. Lu said that the ideological remolding movement seemed a bit incredible while abroad, and even somewhat terrifying because of the propaganda. After the rectification and anti-rightist struggle began, he had many practical experiences.

　　Not asking about politics not only prevents one from exerting their strength, but is also very dangerous.

　　Is "focusing on professional work and not asking about politics" really feasible? Mr. Lu said that the rulers and big bosses in the United States, in order to maintain their ruling position, hope that employees will "focus on professional work and not ask about politics." Therefore, everyone there worries about "losing their job." As long as they can work and get paid, they are satisfied and have no interest in asking about politics. He said that some people admire the freedom to choose a profession in the United States. On the surface, there is freedom to choose a profession in the United States, but, he said, one should add: "Capitalists also have the freedom to take away your profession at will." He said that after returning home, he personally saw that a small number of comrades were restless if their work was slightly unsatisfactory, and even insisted on leaving. In the United States, if you are willing to leave, willing to be unemployed, then that's the end of it. He said, now I understand that our method is not like that. Our work is carried out according to the state's plan, and our manpower allocation is also planned. For the sake of the country's construction, personal temporary dissatisfaction can be completely overcome. Scientists participate in formulating plans and complete research tasks according to national plans, and that is politics. Mr. Lu said that if a person does not have this understanding, puts personal interests above national interests, and follows the rightists in shouting and making trouble at the slightest dissatisfaction, then they will naturally be fooled by the rightists and even be dragged down. Therefore, his current view is that "not asking about politics not only prevents one from exerting their strength, but is also very dangerous." He said that this is an important gain in the ideological remolding movement, and it was obtained unconsciously.

　　Rightists are not standing in the same "circle" as our people.

　　"How to distinguish between right and wrong" is also a question Mr. Lu considered. He said that he felt that distinguishing between right and wrong was a very difficult task. At the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, he felt that many things were unclear. In particular, when the criticism of the rightists mentioned some things about the capitalist system, and the rightists mentioned that "the leaders of schools and scientific research units should be democratically elected," etc., he initially felt that these opinions might have "good and desirable" aspects. When these things were first criticized, he also had the impression that "saying the wrong word would be subject to very severe criticism," resulting in: "The more you say, the more mistakes you make; the less you say, the fewer mistakes you make; saying nothing is the best," or only "saying things you don't mean, just shouting slogans with others." Later, he participated in many criticism meetings and constantly talked with his comrades, and slowly he became clear. He said: "It is not that you cannot speak; you can and should speak. The question is from what standpoint you speak." He also became able to distinguish the bad things said by the rightists. He said, "As long as you stand in the same 'circle' as the Party and the majority of the people in the country, if you say something wrong, even if it is completely wrong, it is still a matter of right and wrong within the people, because the motivation is to do a good job." He now knows that the rightists were not originally people standing in the same "circle" as the majority of the people in the country. The rightists are standing "outside" the people's circle. When we do the people's cause well, the rightists are jealous; when we do it badly, the rightists gloat. In order to undermine the people's cause, the rightists viciously fabricate rumors and slander the Communist Party of China, which serves the people wholeheartedly. From the many facts revealed in the anti-rightist struggle, he said: "It is entirely necessary to oppose the rightists."

　　Mutual criticism, pointing out shortcomings to increase advantages, is further "respect for the individual."

　　Foreign countries emphasize "respect for the individual," saying that returning home will "obliterate the individual." Is our country like this? This is another issue Mr. Lu Yuanjiu paid attention to. He said that in the United States, people only say "good," "very good," or "best" to each other, and rarely say "bad things" (i.e., criticism). Two neighbors can scold each other behind their backs, but still say nice things to each other in person. This is so-called "respect for the individual." He related this to the anti-rightist struggle, saying that he was initially unaccustomed to it from the perspective of "respect for the individual." When he saw that everyone was only talking about the shortcomings of the rightists when criticizing them, he thought, "Don't the rightists have any advantages?" It seemed very disrespectful to the individual. He said that this issue is now also very clear. The so-called "respect for the individual" in capitalist society is hypocritical, and that kind of "respect" obviously has no benefits. But in our case, as long as they are people standing within the people's "circle," we respect each other's advantages, but we also do not hide or cover up each other's shortcomings. Mutual criticism, pointing out shortcomings and errors, correcting shortcomings and errors, and increasing advantages is certainly a good thing. It should be said that this is further "respect for the individual." Such a good thing cannot be done in capitalist society even if they want to. As for the rightists, they are people standing outside the people's "circle." He emphasized: "The rightists being criticized now are those who want to lead us down the wrong path, they are enemies of the people, so what advantages are there to mention? But now, even when dealing with such people, we only hold a few debate meetings and everyone talks about the principles. If the criticism makes them feel pain and repent, then we can talk about advantages and disadvantages. In this sense, the anti-rightist struggle is still curing diseases and saving people, isn't this also a great good thing! Therefore, I feel that the anti-rightist struggle is very necessary." When he talked about criticizing Qian Weichang (the preparatory director of the Institute of Automation and Remote Control), he said that at first, when the meeting was held at Tsinghua University to criticize him, because only bad things were said, he couldn't figure out what was going on. Later, when the Chinese Academy of Sciences invited scientists in Beijing to hold a forum to criticize Qian Weichang, his thinking began to change; and he also revealed some of Qian Weichang's erroneous words and deeds at the meeting. Of course, he later had a deeper understanding of Qian's mistakes.

　　After returning home to participate in study, my own direction of effort became clear

　　Mr. Lu Yuanjiu felt that he could now understand what ideological remolding was all about. He said, "My current feeling is that it is very important for ideological remolding to rely on one's own consciousness; it is not forced." He recalled that in the United States, students generally only knew Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou, and almost nothing else. After returning home, he naturally learned many things; and he also felt that it was necessary to study. If you don't study, you can't do your job well in the first place. He especially recalled the arrangement of time. He said: "Now studying politics is arranged at a specific time, and it does not affect other work or rest. When I was abroad, I spent some time endlessly talking about housing, baseball, or even some boring things." He felt that after returning home to participate in study, his own direction of effort became clear. He said: "In the past, I worked only for myself. Apart from being hired, I only put my energy into paying attention to my own living conditions. I especially felt that I was being exploited spiritually." He now feels that his work is for the people, and he is participating in a collective cause, so he is spiritually happy!

　　Mr. Lu also talked about his recent work situation. He said that he is now responsible for research work in the field of production process automation at the institute. He feels that his work responsibilities are very heavy and that there is too much work to do. He did not feel that there was any problem of "having a title without power." He said that his current situation is: "I only hate that my abilities are not enough for the work I am doing; I don't have three heads and six arms."

　　Mr. Lu said that this time he participated in the rectification and anti-rightist struggle. At first, he discovered that his political level was too low, and further, he learned many things, while also discovering that there were even more things that needed to be learned.

　　思想改造大有好处
　　——访自动化专家陆元九先生
　　本报记者　蔡鉴远
    在中国科学院自动化及远距离操纵研究所的一间安静的小屋里，我访问了从美国归来不久的陆元九先生。我们的谈话，是从陆先生诉说他在美国急切想回到祖国而又遭到美国当局无理阻挠开始的。
      陆先生是1945年到美国麻省理工学院做研究生的，1949年得仪器工程学博士学位，以后就在麻省理工学院做了五年研究工作。从1954年到1956年回国止，他又在福特汽车公司研究汽涡轮机的控制问题。他说他是早就打算回国的，只因为新中国建立以后，美国政府对中国留学生的回国万般阻挠，才使他耽搁到去年。在这期间，美国政府为了阻止他回国，曾经用了各种办法，不是司法部的“移民局”叫去问，就是“联邦调查局”（美国特务机关）叫去盘查。问什么“中美打起仗来你反对那一边”等问题。他们对盘问留学生本人还不满足，还时常打探隔壁邻居。同时美国政府还不断地向留学生宣传什么“回到共产党中国，要给关到集中营，行动没有自由”等等。他们特别宣传回国来就得要“Brain—Washing”（“洗脑筋”）。陆先生说：“可是不管怎样宣传，留学生们反正想念自己的祖国，要回国的心是坚定不移的。”他停顿了一下又说：“不过心里也还有疑虑，回国前我是这样想，回国后我不搞政治，只要我一心搞业务工作，就不会出什么问题了。”
    他说，美国人所谓的“洗脑筋”，就是指我们的思想改造。美国宣传机关还说，回到中国的人不能随便想，随便说。但是陆先生用他回国后的经历，驳斥了敌人的诬蔑。
    从跨上祖国海岸的那天起，脑筋里不断装进新东西，脑筋开阔了
    陆先生去年6月间回到北京，7月初分配到中国科学院工作，8月1日开始上班。过了十来天，他就到中国科学院在长春的机械电机研究所去了解情况，因为那里的一部分工作要合并到自动化及远距离操纵研究所来。接着就参加搞研究所成立的筹备工作，一直忙了两个多月。12月里，他随中国科学院的考察团到苏联去考察关于自动化研究工作的情况，今年3月初才从苏联回来。4月里，他又参与接待苏联专家的到来。到5月，比较正规化的业务工作才开始。“回国后一年了，过的真快！”回国以来，他说，只感到从去年由香港转广州跨上祖国海岸的那一天起，他脑筋里就不断地装进他所不知道的新东西，装进他在国外时想也想不到的东西，仿佛脑筋开阔了。他说，也许这就可以叫做“洗脑筋”吧。
    我们的思想改造运动，陆先生说，在国外时的确感到有点不可思议，甚至被宣传得有点恐怖感。整风、反右派斗争开始以后，他有了许多实际的感受。
    不问政治，不仅不能发挥自己的力量，而且很危险
    “专心搞业务，不问政治”到底行不行？陆先生说，美国的统治者和大老板们为了维持他们的统治地位，是希望工作人员“专心搞业务，不问政治”的，所以在那里大家忧愁的是“怕丢掉了差事”，只要能工作拿钱，就会心满意足，也没有什么心思去问政治。他说有些人羡慕美国有选择职业的自由。在美国表面上有选择职业的自由，但是，他说，后面应该加上一句：“资本家也有随便把你的职业去掉的自由”。他说他回国以后，曾经亲自看到，小部分同志工作稍有不如意就不安心，甚至闹着要离开。要在美国，你甘愿离开、甘愿失业，那走了就完了。他说，现在我懂得了，我们的办法不是那样。我们的工作是根据国家的计划进行的，我们的人力的调配也是有计划的。为了国家的建设事业，个人暂时的不如意，是完全可以克服的。科学家参加制订计划，根据国家计划完成研究任务，这就是政治。陆先生说，如果一个人没有这样一点认识，把个人利益放在国家利益之上，稍有不如意就跟着右派分子乱喊、乱闹，那自然就会上右派分子的当，甚至被拉下水去。所以他现在的看法是，“不问政治，不仅不能发挥自己的力量，而且很危险。”他说，这就是他在思想改造运动中的一个重要收获，而且是不知不觉得到的。
    右派分子同我们全国人民不是站在同一“圈子”里的
    “如何辨别是非”，这也是陆先生考虑的一个问题。他说，他感到辨别是非是一件很不容易的事。反右派斗争开始时，他就感到许多事情都弄不清楚。特别是当批判右派分子提到的资本主义制度的一些东西，以及右派分子提到的“学校、科学研究单位的领导人应该民主选举”等等，他初听时总觉得这些意见也可能有“好的、可取的”部分。当最初批判这些东西的时候，他还有这样的印象，好像“说错了一句话就要受到很严厉的批判”，结果是：“多说多错，少说少错，不说不错”，或者只能“不说心里话，只跟着别人叫口号”。后来，他参加过很多次批判会，不断地和同志们谈心，慢慢地他清楚了。他说：“话并非不能说，可以说而且应该说，问题在于站在什么立场说话”。他对右派分子说的一些坏话，也有了分辨的能力。他说，“只要和党和全国大多数人民站在同一个‘圈子’内，讲错了，即使完全错了，也还只是人民内部的是非问题，因为动机是为了搞好工作。”他现在已经知道，右派分子原来不是同我们全国大多数人民站在同一“圈子”里的人。右派分子们是站在人民的“圈外”。我们把人民的事业做好了，右派分子就嫉妒；做坏了，右派分子就幸灾乐祸。为要破坏人民的事业，右派分子就恶毒地造谣诬蔑全心全意为人民服务的中国共产党。从反右派斗争中揭露的许多事实看来，他说：“反对右派是完全必要的。”
    互相批评，指出缺点，使优点增多，这是进一步的“尊重个人”
    在外国很讲究“尊重个人”，说回国来就会“抹煞个人”。我们的国家是不是这样呢？这是陆元九先生注意的又一个问题。他说，在美国，人与人之间彼此只讲“好”，“很好”，或“最好”，很少讲讲“坏话”（即批评的话）。两邻居，背面可以互相骂得狗血淋头，但当面仍然互相说好话。这就是所谓“尊重个人”。他联系到反右派斗争说，从“尊重个人”的角度看，起初他也是不习惯的。看到批判右派分子时，大家说的尽是右派分子的缺点，他曾经想“难道右派分子就没有优点了吗”？好像很不“尊重个人”。他说，这个问题现在也很清楚了。资本主义社会的所谓“尊重个人”是虚伪的，那样的“尊重”显然没有什么好处。而我们呢，只要是站在人民“圈子”内的人，彼此的优点互相尊重，但是彼此的缺点也不互相掩蔽、互相包庇。互相批评，指出缺点、错误，把缺点、错误改了，使优点增多，这当然是好事。应该说，这是进一步的“尊重个人”。这样的好事，在资本主义社会是想办也办不到的。至于右派分子则是站在人民“圈子”外边的人。他着重说：“现在所批判的右派分子，是想把我们带着走错路的人了，是人民的敌人，还有什么优点可提呢？但是现在对待这样的人，也不过开几次辩论会，大家讲讲道理。如果批判得使他感到痛，而痛改前非，那才谈得到优点缺点。从这一意义来说，反右派斗争也还是治病救人，这不也是大大的好事么！所以感到反右派斗争很有必要。”他谈到批判钱伟长（自动化及远距离操纵研究所的筹备主任）时，他说，起初在清华大学开会批判时，因为只讲坏的，他就弄不清楚是怎么回事。后来中国科学院邀集在京科学家举行座谈会批判钱伟长时，他的想法开始扭转了；并且他在会上也揭发了钱伟长的一些错误言行。以后当然对钱的错误有了更深的认识。
    回国参加学习以后，自己努力的方向明确了
    思想改造，陆元九先生感到现在可以领会是怎么回事了。他说，“我现在的感觉是，思想改造依靠自己的自觉很重要，不是强迫的。”他回想起在美国时，留学生们一般只知道毛主席和周总理，别的什么事几乎都不知道。他回国以后就自然而然地学习了许多东西；并且也感到非学习不可。如果不学习，首先就不能把工作搞好。他特别回想到时间的安排。他说：“现在学习政治，是安排在一定的时间里，并不影响其他工作或休息。在国外时，是把一些时间用在无休止地谈住房、谈棒球上去了，甚或谈些无聊的事。”他感到回国参加学习以后，自己努力的方向明确了。他说：“过去工作只是为了自己，除了被雇佣的工作以外，只把精力用在讲究自己的一点生活条件，特别感到精神上是被剥削的。”他现在感受到，自己的工作是为了人民，是在参与一个集体的事业，所以精神上是愉快的！
    陆先生还谈到了他最近的工作情况。他说，现在他在研究所里是负责搞生产过程自动化方面的研究工作。他感到他的工作责任很重，工作多得做不完。他没有感到什么“有职无权”的问题。他说，他现在的情况是：“我担任的工作，只恨自己能力不够，没有三头六臂。”
    陆先生说，这次他参加整风和反右派斗争，起初是发现自己的政治水平太低，进一步是学习了很多东西，同时发现需要学习的东西更多。
