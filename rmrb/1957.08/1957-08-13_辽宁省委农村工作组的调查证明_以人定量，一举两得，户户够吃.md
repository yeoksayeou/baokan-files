Xinhua News Agency Dispatch by Reporter Yang Shaoshan: This reporter followed the work group of the Rural Work Department of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and conducted an investigation into the amount of grain retained for peasant rations. The results of the investigation prove that changing the current method of average grain retention and implementing the method of calculating the amount of grain retained for rations "based on population" not only meets the grain needs of various populations but also saves grain for the country. Farmers reflect that this method achieves two goals at once, ensuring enough food for every household.

The Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Huayuantuo Township, Gaiping County, is a large cooperative with more than 2,400 households. The proportion of cotton acreage is very high, and the state supplies a lot of grain every year. However, due to the average distribution of grain according to the "Three Fixes" policy, households with many adults and strong labor forces do not have enough grain and request government supply, exceeding the supply standards. Since June, many members of the cooperative have been going to the cooperative every day to request early supply of grain. After investigation, it was found that many households were indeed not getting enough to eat. However, households with many children and weak labor forces not only had enough grain but also had a surplus. As a result, there was uneven distribution of hardship and happiness among the members of the cooperative, and the grain-deficient households had many opinions, which even led to unrest in production.

How to solve it? Most farmers agree to implement the "grain quota based on population" retention method. The work group absorbed opinions from all parties and, based on the principle of "those who eat more get more, and those who eat less get less," researched the actual grain consumption of different people and divided it into the following six classes and seven levels according to different ages. The standard is: children aged one to three retain 200 jin of grain per person per year; children aged four to seven retain 330 jin of grain per person per year; school-age children aged eight to fifteen retain 480 jin of grain per person per year; men aged sixteen to sixty-five retain 630 jin of grain per person per year; women aged sixteen to sixty-five retain 580 jin of grain per person per year; men and women over sixty-five years of age retain 500 jin of grain per person per year; and big eaters who everyone knows can eat retain 700 jin of grain per year. According to this standard, the total grain needed by the entire cooperative is 6,558,540 jin, with an average retention of 504 jin and four taels per person per year. Although this figure is slightly higher than the actual average retention per person last year, if calculated according to the "Three Fixes" standard, 200,302 jin of grain can be retained less.

After investigation and analysis, it is necessary to pay attention to educating farmers to practice grain conservation when using this method; determining the grain ration standard for farmers should be adapted to local conditions. Regarding the surplus grain beyond the "Three Fixes," the work group's opinion is: in areas and cooperatives where the "grain quota based on population" standard does not exceed the "Three Fixes" standard, the surplus part, in addition to the state purchasing 40%, should be handled by the farmers themselves; in areas and cooperatives where the "grain quota based on population" exceeds the "Three Fixes" standard, the state should deduct the excess part of the "grain quota based on population" from the surplus grain, and the remainder should be handled by the farmers themselves. For economic crop cooperatives, the "Three Fixes" regulations should still be adhered to, and the retention should be calculated according to the surplus grain cooperative standard.

    辽宁省委农村工作组的调查证明
    以人定量，一举两得，户户够吃
    新华社讯　记者杨绍山报道：记者随中共辽宁省委农村工作部工作组，就农民口粮留量进行了调查。调查结果证明，改变目前平均留粮的办法，实行“以人定量”计算社员口粮留量的办法，不但能满足各种人口粮需要，还可以为国家节省粮食。农民们反映这种办法是一举两得，户户够吃。
    盖平县花园坨乡太阳升农业社是一个拥有两千四百多户的大社，棉花面积比重很大，国家每年供应粮食很多。但是，由于根据“三定”政策的留粮标准，按照人口平均分配，大人多劳力强的户粮食不够吃，要求政府供应，突破了供应标准。6月份以来，每天都有很多社员到社里要求提前供应粮食，经过了解，其中很多户确实是不够吃。可是，小孩多劳力弱的户，粮食不但够吃，而且还有余。结果造成社员和社员之间苦乐不均，缺粮户意见很多，以至于生产也不安心。
    如何解决？大多数农民都同意实行“以人定量”的留粮办法。工作组吸收了各方面的意见，本着“吃多多分，吃少少分”的原则，将不同人的实际用粮数量进行了研究，按照不同的年岁，划分了下列六等七级标准。这个标准是：一岁到三岁的小孩每人每年留粮二百斤；四岁到七岁的儿童每人每年留粮三百三十斤；八岁到十五岁的学龄儿童每人每年留粮四百八十斤；十六岁至六十五岁的男人每人每年留粮六百三十斤；十六岁到六十五岁的妇女每人每年留粮五百八十斤；六十五岁以上的男女老人每人每年留粮五百斤，人人都知道的能吃的大肚汉，每年留粮七百斤。按这个标准计算，全社总计需粮六百五十五万八千五百四十斤，平均每人每年留粮五百零四斤四两。这个数字，虽然比去年每人平均实留量高些，但如果按“三定”规定标准平均每人每年留量还可以少留粮二十万零三千零二十斤。
    经过调查分析，用这种办法，还必须注意教育农民实行节约粮食；确定农民口粮标准应该因地制宜。关于“三定”以外超产粮食，工作组意见：凡是“以人定量”标准不超过“三定”标准的地区和合作社，超产部分除国家征购40％以外，其余应归农民自己处理；凡是“以人定量”超过了“三定”标准的地区和合作社，国家应该从超产粮食中扣除“以人定量”的超过部分，其余再归农民自己处理。对于经济作物社，仍应坚持“三定”规定，按余粮社标准计算留量。
