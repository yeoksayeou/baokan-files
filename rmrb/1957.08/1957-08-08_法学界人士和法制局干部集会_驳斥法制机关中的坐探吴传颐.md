Legal Professionals and Legal Bureau Cadres Gather to Refute Wu Chuanyi, a Mole in Legal Institutions

(Our Newspaper) In recent legal profession symposiums and consecutive cadre meetings held by the State Council's Legal Bureau, the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies of rightist Wu Chuanyi from the legal profession were severely refuted.

Wu Chuanyi is a director of the Political Science and Law Association and deputy head of the Finance and Trade Regulations Group of the State Council's Legal Bureau. During the rightists' attack on the Party, he played the role of a mole within the legal institutions. Wu Chuanyi directly participated in the work of compiling the State Council's regulations and was fully aware of the many important laws, individual regulations, rules, decisions, instructions, etc., promulgated before and after our announcement of the Constitution. However, at the Political Science and Law Association symposium, he deliberately slandered us as having "no laws to follow."

Wu Chuanyi also negated the judicial reform movement in terms of its direction, effect, and conclusions. He believed that whether the judicial reform movement "conforms to Marxism-Leninism is doubtful." During the judicial reform, Wu Chuanyi was a member of the former Legislative Affairs Commission. The draft company law he drafted was intended to have "five types of economies advance side by side," for the Party and the People's Government to act as "advisors" to capitalists, and for capitalists to be the marshals. He also wanted to use this kind of company law to supplement the "deficiencies" of the Common Program in order to achieve his goal of smuggling in the old Six Codes and restoring the old legal system. At the Political Science and Law Association symposium, Wu Chuanyi also openly called on old legal personnel not to remove the label of old law, to show that he wanted to be a filial son and virtuous grandson of the old legal system, and to resist the people's legal system to the end.

Wu Chuanyi's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds are inseparable from his reactionary history. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he published many reactionary articles in the *San Min Chu I Weekly*, openly slandering materialism and historical materialism, and praising Chen Lifu's Vitalism and Vitalistic view of history. On the one hand, he smeared "Marxism-Leninism as having incurable wounds in its system." On the other hand, he shamelessly praised Chiang Kai-shek, saying, "Only Chiang Kai-shek's genius could put the laws of social development on the historical agenda."

### 法学界人士和法制局干部集会  驳斥法制机关中的坐探吴传颐

    法学界人士和法制局干部集会
    驳斥法制机关中的坐探吴传颐
    本报讯　在最近两次法学界座谈会和国务院法制局连日举行的干部会上，法学界右派分子吴传颐的反党反社会主义谬论受到了严厉的驳斥。
    吴传颐是政法学会理事，国务院法制局财贸法规组副组长，在右派分子向党进攻中，他起了在法制机关坐探的作用。吴传颐直接参加国务院的法规汇编工作，对于我们公布宪法前后所公布的许多重要法律、单行条例、规章、决定、指示等是完全知道的，可是他在政法学界座谈会上却故意污蔑我们 “无法可依”。
    吴传颐还对司法改革运动从方针上、作用上和结论上来加以否定。他认为司法改革运动“是否合乎马列主义值得怀疑”。司法改革时，吴传颐是前法制委员会委员，他起草的公司法草案是要“五种经济齐头并进”，要党与人民政府为资本家当“参谋”，由资本家当元帅。他还想用这种内容的公司法来补充共同纲领的“不足”，以达到他私运旧六法恢复旧法统的目的。吴传颐在政法学界座谈会上还公开号召旧法人员不要摘掉旧法帽子，来表示他要做旧法统的孝子贤孙，与人民法制抵抗到底。
    吴传颐的反党反社会主义言行是与他的反动历史分不开的。早在抗日战争期间，他在三民主义周刊上曾经发表过许多反动文章，公开污蔑唯物论，唯物史观，赞扬陈立夫的唯生论，唯生史观。他一面污蔑“马列主义在体系上有无可医治的创伤”。一面无耻的歌颂蒋介石说：“只有蒋介石的天才，才可能把社会发展规律排上了历史日程。”
