According to the Jilin Daily, Changchun is building one of China's largest modern bus manufacturing plants. This factory will manufacture new types of buses. Construction of the main workshops has already begun. On August 13th, the central boiler room project, which will supply the entire plant with heat, broke ground two days ahead of schedule. This project is large in scale, with each roof panel weighing 2.8 tons.

The Changchun Bus Manufacturing Plant began construction in mid-July, and the first batch of temporary projects has been basically completed. Mechanical equipment for the timber workshop, mechanical repair workshop, and prefabrication workshop is being installed. Combined scraper-loaders, excavators, and automatic dump trucks are concentrated at the site and have begun busy operations. The first three formal water supply projects, the water tower, and the pumping station, which began construction in July, have basically completed the foundation work and are starting bricklaying; the reservoir has completed 62.5% of the earthwork. Employees have adopted many measures to enthusiastically launch a campaign to increase production and conserve resources, planning to save 20.9% of cement, 10.8% of steel, and 13.6% of timber throughout the year.
