    Shang Ding is an Arsonist
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Liberation Daily, the Shanghai publishing industry has been holding anti-rightist struggle symposiums for days, during which the reactionary words and deeds of the rightist Shang Ding were exposed and refuted.
    Shang Ding is a standing member of the editorial board of "Academic" monthly and the deputy director of New Knowledge Publishing House. In April of this year, when "Academic" monthly discussed how to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," Shang Ding put forward the fallacy of "organizing poisonous weeds and cultivating poisonous weeds."
    During the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's propaganda work conference, Shang Ding launched a frantic attack on the Party. He wanted to set fire in the academic field, clamoring: "The outside world is speaking out freely, but the Academic Monthly is lifeless and sleeping in the drum."
    Shang Ding's speech at the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's propaganda work conference was an extremely vicious poisonous arrow. He attempted to overthrow the Party's leadership over the publishing industry by using malicious insults, negating achievements, and distorting facts. He said that the directors of the publishing houses are all Party members, and the editorial boards of the publishing houses are managed by the Party in every detail. He also said that non-Party members in the publishing house are just for show, and the Publishing Bureau and the Propaganda Department have serious sectarianism in selecting people. At the publishing group symposium of the propaganda work conference, he also slandered the Party organization of the New Knowledge Publishing House as "Parties protecting each other and colluding with each other." He also said at the same meeting that there was a group of "bodyguards" around the leaders, who would come out to explain for the leaders whenever something happened, so the masses did not dare to speak out boldly, and these people should be removed first. When Wenhui Daily was igniting fires everywhere, Shang Ding also shouted at the publishing group meeting that the "stinky lid" of the New Knowledge Publishing House had not been uncovered, and provided information to the Wenhui Daily reporter so that the reporter could cooperate with him to uncover the "lid."
    Shang Ding echoed other rightists, and their relationship was very close. Someone in Beijing said, "A single color, the Party's world"; he slandered, "Today, every unit has to install a Party member, and if there are not enough Party members, they will develop greatly, so the quality of Party members is very poor." He went to Beijing in May, and the rightist leaders in Beijing, Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Bojun, Chen Xingui, and Gu Zhizhong, all invited him to dinner separately.
    The anti-rightist struggle symposium in the Shanghai publishing industry will continue to be held.

    尚丁是一个纵火者
    本报讯　据解放日报报道：上海出版界连日举行反右派斗争座谈会，会上揭露和驳斥了右派分子尚丁的反动言行。
    尚丁是“学术”月刊编委会常委、新知识出版社副社长。在今年4月间学术月刊讨论如何贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针时，尚丁就提出了“组织毒草、培养毒草”的谬论。
    在中共上海市委宣传工作会议的期间，尚丁更对党发动了疯狂的进攻。他要在学术界放火，大肆叫嚣：“外面都在大鸣大放，学术月刊却死气沉沉，睡在鼓里。”
    尚丁在中共上海市委宣传工作会议上的发言，是一支极其凶恶的毒箭。他用恶意谩骂、抹煞成绩和歪曲事实的方法，企图推翻党对出版事业的领导。他说，出版社的正社长都是党员，出版社的编委会事无巨细，都由党包办。并说，非党的人在出版社里是摆样子，出版局、宣传部挑选人有严重的宗派主义。在宣传工作会议的出版小组座谈会上，他还诬蔑新知识出版社的党组织是“党党相护、狼狈为奸”。他并在同一会上说，在领导周围有一批“保镖”的，一有事就出来替领导解释，因此群众不敢大胆鸣放，应该先把这些人撤下来。当文汇报到处点火时，尚丁也在出版小组会上大叫新知识出版社的“臭盖子”没揭开，并向文汇报记者提供情况，让这个记者能配合他来揭“盖子”。
    尚丁同其他右派分子互相呼应，关系是十分密切的。北京有人说，“清一色，党天下”；他就污蔑说，“今天每一单位都要安一党员，党员不够了，就大发展，所以党员质量很差”。他在5月间去过一趟北京，在北京的右派头子章乃器、章伯钧、陈新桂和顾执中等人都分别请他吃饭。
    上海出版界反右派斗争的座谈会还将继续举行。
