Throw Oneself into the Collective
　　Bi Ye
　　Decades of history sternly tell us that there are only two paths before writers: either revolution or counter-revolution, either integration with the working people or betrayal of the people.

　　A writer, after being educated and cultivated by the Party, should wholeheartedly engage in creative labor tirelessly for the Party and the people, arming himself with the ideology of the working class, enriching himself with the emotions of the working class, and writing works needed by the Party and the people.

　　It should be said that when a writer produces a work, it reflects the great power of the working people in creating a new society. Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people, whether on the industrial front, the agricultural front, or in coastal defense and border regions, are marching towards the common goal of socialism, creating unprecedented feats for the country. It is precisely because the Chinese people have generated many admirable people and events in this struggle that writers have rich subject matter and full heroic images, and can write better literary works.

　　As a writer, facing this magnificent reality today, one should be grateful for the correct leadership of the Party and the glorious labor and creation of the Chinese people, thereby feeling more humbly that one's works might fall short of the Party and the people's expectations, thereby loving the Party and the people more, and thereby more enthusiastically singing praises of this magnificent reality of social life that has never existed in human history.

　　If the Party is compared to the sunshine, if the people are compared to the soil, then writers are the flowers that grow up under the sunshine and nurtured by the soil. Therefore, a writer cannot leave the Party and the people at all. If a writer leaves the Party and the people, then he will become rootless, fall into darkness, and wither quickly.

　　But there is a type of writer who does not think this way, and Ding Ling is the most prominent example.

　　Ding Ling wrote "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," and she became carried away. She forgot that the Party's leadership of the peasants' struggle to achieve victory constituted the foundation and content of her work, and instead used her work to ask the Party for credit and flaunt it to the Chinese people. It was as if it was not the Party and the people who brought her honor, but she herself who brought infinite glory to the Party and the people. Therefore, she felt that she was superior to the Party, reigning over the people, and very arrogant!

　　Thus, she felt that her work was like a towering revolutionary monument, to which people could only bow their heads in reverence!

　　Thus, she felt that her功劳功劳 was higher than the sky and bigger than the earth, and she was so great that the heavens and the earth could not contain her!

　　Thus, she felt that the Party had treated her unfairly and the people owed her a debt!

　　Thus, she turned herself into a self-centered person, opened up an insatiable desire pit, and became a monstrous ultra-bourgeois individualist.

　　Of course, the Party and bourgeois individualism are incompatible, so writers as arrogant and complacent as Ding Ling are bound to embark on the dead-end road of anti-Party and anti-people. When the Party pointed out Ding Ling's serious mistakes, she harbored resentment. And once she believed that the time had come, she would inevitably launch a frenzied attack on the Party.

　　But the Party, which is loved by 600 million people, is as solid as a rock, unshaken by countless storms and waves. Ding Ling is destined to break her head and bleed on the Party's bedrock!

　　I think that comrades from petty-bourgeois intellectual backgrounds should take Ding Ling as a warning, especially writers.

　　Overcoming individualism, throwing oneself into the collective, closely aligning with the Party, uniting with the broad masses of working people, advancing with vigor and joy, singing praises of the Party and the people's glorious cause, and dedicating one's life and energy unreservedly to the Party's literary cause, is the attitude that writers should have today.

　　If a writer forgets this, he will inevitably embark on the wrong path against the Party and will inevitably be spurned by the people!

    投向集体 　 碧野
    几十年来的历史严正地告诉我们，摆在作家面前的道路只有两条：不是革命就是反革命，不是和劳动人民结合就是背叛人民。
    一个作家，经过党的教育和培养，他应该忠心耿耿地为党为人民不息地进行创作劳动，以工人阶级思想来武装自己，以工人阶级感情来丰富自己，写出党和人民所需要的作品。
    应该说，一个作家产生一部作品，它是反映劳动人民创造新社会的伟大力量的。中国人民在党的领导下，不论是在工业战线上，不论是在农业战线上，不论是在海防和边疆，都在朝社会主义的共同目标迈进，给国家创造了前所未有的丰功伟绩。正因为中国人民在这一奋斗中，产生了许许多多可歌可颂的人与事，作家才有丰富的题材和饱满的英雄形象，才能写出较优秀的文学作品。
    作为一个作家，面对今天这一壮丽的现实，应该感谢党的正确领导、中国人民的光辉劳动创造，从而更虚心地感觉到唯恐自己的作品有负于党、有负于人民，从而更热爱党更热爱人民，从而更热情地去歌颂人类社会从未有过的这一壮丽的现实生活。
    如果把党比作阳光，如果把人民比作土壤，那么作家就是在阳光的照耀下和土壤的培育中成长起来的花朵。所以一个作家丝毫不能离开党和人民。如果一个作家离开了党和人民，那么他就会变得无根，落到黑暗里，很快地枯死。
    但是有一类作家却不这样想，这以丁玲最为突出。
    丁玲写成了一本“太阳照在桑乾河上”，于是她得意忘形了。她忘了党领导农民斗争取得的胜利，构成她这作品的基础和内容，反而用她的这部作品向党邀功，向中国人民炫耀。好像不是党和人民给她带来了荣誉，而是她个人给党和人民带来了无限光彩似的。因而她觉得自己比党高出一等，驾临于人民之上，很不可一世！
    于是她觉得自己的这一部作品像一座巍峨的革命纪念碑，人们只有向它低首虔敬的份儿！
    于是她觉得自己的功劳比天还高，比地还大，她高大得了不得，好像天地都容不下她！
    于是她觉得党亏待了她，人民负了她的债！
    于是她把自己变成自我中心，张大了一个难填的欲窟，成了一个极端资产阶级个人主义的怪物。
    当然党和资产阶级个人主义是不相容的，于是像丁玲这样狂妄自大和居功骄傲的作家，势必走上反党反人民的绝路。当党指出丁玲这一严重错误的时候，她就怀恨在心。而一旦当她心目中认为时机到来，她就必然向党发动猖狂的进攻。
    但是受到六亿人民爱戴的党是固如磐石的，多少腥风血雨摧不倒，多少险波恶浪掀不动。丁玲也只有注定在党的磐石上碰得头破血流！
    我觉得小资产阶级知识分子出身的同志，应该以丁玲作为殷鉴，特别是作家们，更应该以丁玲作为殷鉴。
    克服个人主义，投向集体，紧紧地靠拢党，和广大的劳动人民结成一体，精神焕发而心情愉快地前进，歌颂党和人民的光辉事业，把自己的生命和精力毫无保留地献给党的文学事业，是我们今天作家应有的态度。
    如果一个作家忘记了这一点，他必然会走上反党的歧途，必然会被人民唾弃！
