In order to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the People's Publishing House, Sanlian Bookstore, World Knowledge Press, and other publishers revised the "Selected Translation Catalog of Philosophical and Social Science Works (1956-1967)" (initial draft) compiled last year in the spring of this year. The selected translation catalog includes a total of 1,632 books (some of which had already been published when the catalog was finalized), including 520 in philosophy, 290 in economics, 186 in various schools of socialist thought, 144 in political science, 72 in international relations, 356 in history, and 64 in geography. The books listed in the selected translation catalog are all basic works with relatively large representation, taking into account the needs of both research and criticism.

This selected translation catalog was created under the guidance and assistance of Party and state organs, through extensive social connections and the active support of the masses. The selection and translation catalog will be coordinated and divided among the People's Publishing House, Sanlian Bookstore, World Knowledge Press, Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, People's Literature Publishing House, Science Press, Law Press, Shanghai People's Publishing House, and Hubei People's Publishing House to jointly organize and publish the works. They will be published in stages according to their priority and urgency.

So far, 294 manuscripts have been commissioned. Among them, the philosophy category includes the main works of Hegel, Feuerbach, Kant, Russell, Dietzgen, Herzen, Chernyshevsky, and Plekhanov, as well as works on classical logic and mathematical logic. The economics category includes the works of Adam Smith, Ricardo, Böhm-Bawerk, and Keynes. The category of various schools of socialist thought includes the works of More, Fourier, and Owen. The political science category includes the works of Montesquieu, Rousseau, and others. Fifty-six books have already been published. Twenty-nine are about to be published, including Rousseau's "Discourse on the Origin of Inequality," Morgan's "Ancient Society," and Plekhanov's "Fundamental Problems of Marxism."
