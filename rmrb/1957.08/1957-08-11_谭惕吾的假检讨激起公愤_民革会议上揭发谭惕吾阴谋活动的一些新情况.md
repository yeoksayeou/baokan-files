    Tan Tiwu's False Self-Criticism Arouses Public Outrage
    New Developments in Exposing Tan Tiwu's Conspiracy Activities at the KMT Revolutionary Committee Meeting
    (Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that on the morning of August 10th, the Central Committee of the KMT Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the KMT Revolutionary Committee jointly held an enlarged meeting to conduct persuasive struggle against the rightist Tan Tiwu.
    At the beginning of the meeting, Tan Tiwu first made a self-criticism. However, this self-criticism draft was written on June 30th. Tan Tiwu's bad attitude aroused great indignation among everyone. So much so that after the chairman of the meeting issued two warnings to her, he had to stop her so-called "self-criticism."
    In his speech, Jiang Yanong pointed out that Tan Tiwu described herself in her self-criticism as if she did not have any close relationship with Lin Xiling, which was dishonest. He revealed that after Tan Tiwu had a conflict with Lu Yuwen, she immediately told Lin Xiling about Lu Yuwen's history, and Lin Xiling was preparing to spread these materials in the school to attack Lu Yuwen. Jiang Yanong asked: If Tan Tiwu did not have a close relationship with Lin Xiling, why did she tell her about Lu Yuwen's situation?
    Tan Tiwu described herself in her self-criticism as if she cared for young people very much, but Ma Zhanzhong, the principal of the Affiliated Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School of Renmin University, who was specially invited to attend, exposed her on the spot. Ma Zhanzhong said that Liu Zezhi, an 18-year-old student at the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School, was poisoned by Tan Tiwu. Tan Tiwu taught Liu Zezhi to follow her own example and become a double-dealer. Under the influence of Tan Tiwu, this student behaved very badly in school, even to the point that the class could not be taught, and even pulled another Communist Youth League member over to his side.
    Tang Zhipeng used the facts of the KMT Revolutionary Committee's Housing Management Bureau branch in Beijing to refute Tan Tiwu's lies that "the united front work has not reached the grassroots" and that "democratic personages are ignored." He said that the development and growth of the Housing Management Bureau branch from scratch was achieved with the help of the Communist Party branch. Thirteen of the fifty members of the Housing Management Bureau's KMT Revolutionary Committee branch have been promoted to section chiefs. Our entire branch expresses great anger at Tan Tiwu's fallacies.
    Jiao Shizhai revealed the relationship between Tan Tiwu and Fan Puzhai. Fan Puzhai was a strategist of the Zhang-Luo alliance and also Tan Tiwu's advisor. Jiao Shizhai said that Fan and Tan jointly planned to attack the Party. In order to attack Lu Yuwen, Tan Tiwu sought help from Fan Puzhai. Fan Puzhai offered a plan: in order to isolate the Communist Party, first attack the activists, and kill them with one blow. Therefore, Fan Puzhai introduced Tan Tiwu to someone to collect Lu Yuwen's historical materials. In addition, Fan Puzhai knew about Zhang Bojun's anti-Party materials, but said that he was not prepared to expose them at that time, which was also praised by Tan Tiwu, who said that Fan was "old-fashioned." After the People's Daily published the editorial "Why is This?" on June 8, Tan Tiwu went to Fan Puzhai's home that evening to discuss countermeasures and study "is this loosening or tightening?" At the same time, they also made an estimate of the situation at that time, just like the estimate made at the meeting of the six professors of the Zhang-Luo alliance on June 6. Therefore, at the enlarged meeting of the KMT Revolutionary Committee's central small group on June 16, Tan Tiwu once again launched an attack on the Party in her speech.
    Many people who spoke at the meeting unanimously demanded that Tan Tiwu honestly confess and not isolate herself from the people.

    谭惕吾的假检讨激起公愤
    民革会议上揭发谭惕吾阴谋活动的一些新情况
    本报讯　8月10日上午，民革中央和民革北京市委联合举行扩大会议，向右派分子谭惕吾进行说理斗争。
    会议开始，先由谭惕吾进行检讨。而这个检讨稿是在6月30日写成的，谭惕吾这种恶劣的态度，激起了大家极大的愤慨。以至会议的主席在对她提出两次警告之后，不得不制止了她的所谓“检讨”。
    姜亚农在发言中指出：谭惕吾在检讨中把自己描写得好像同林希翎没有甚么密切关系，这种态度是不老实的。他揭发说：谭惕吾在和卢郁文发生了冲突之后，随即把卢郁文的历史告诉了林希翎，林希翎就曾准备把这些材料在学校里传播，以打击卢郁文。姜亚农问道：谭惕吾同林希翎如果没有密切关系，为甚么把卢郁文的情况告诉给她？
    谭惕吾在检讨中把自己描写得好像很爱护青年的样子，被特邀出席的人民大学附属工农速成中学校长马占忠当场予以戳穿。马占忠说，工农速成中学有一个十八岁的学生刘则智，就被谭惕吾毒害了。谭惕吾教刘则智学她自己的榜样，作两面派人物。受了谭惕吾的影响，这个学生在学校表现很不好，甚至闹得班上不能教课，并且把另一个共青团员也拉了过去。
    唐志鹏以民革北京市房管局支部的事实，驳斥谭惕吾的所谓“统战工作没有统到基层”“对民主人士置之不理”的谎言。他说，房管局支部从无到有发展壮大都是在共产党支部的帮助下取得的。房管局民革支部共五十人，已有十三人被提为科长。我们全支部对谭惕吾的谬论表示极大愤怒。
    焦实斋揭露了谭惕吾与范朴斋的关系。范朴斋是章罗联盟的谋士，也是谭惕吾的顾问。焦实斋说，范、谭共同策划过向党进攻，为了打击卢郁文，谭惕吾到范朴斋处求援。范朴斋献策：为了孤立共产党，先打击积极分子，而且要一棍子打死。于是，范朴斋介绍谭惕吾去找人搜集卢郁文的历史材料。另外，范朴斋了解章伯钧的反党材料，但说当时不准备揭发，这也受到谭惕吾的称赞，说范是“古道心肠”。在6月8日人民日报发表“这是为什么”的社论以后，当天晚上，谭惕吾到范朴斋家商量对策，研究“这是放还是收？”同时，他们对当时局势还作了估计。像6月6日章罗联盟六教授会议的估计一样。因此，在6月16日民革中央小组扩大会议上，谭惕吾在发言中再一次向党发动进攻。
    在会上发言的许多人，一致要求谭惕吾老老实实地交代，不要自绝于人民。
