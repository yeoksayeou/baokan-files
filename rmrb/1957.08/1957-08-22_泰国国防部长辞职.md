Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, August 21st: Thai Defense Minister Nai Sarit, Deputy Minister Nai Thanom, and Deputy Interior Minister Nai Praphat simultaneously submitted their resignations on the 20th, requesting to resign from their positions in the cabinet. They are all generals in the Thai army; Nai Sarit also holds the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Nai Sarit said that the reason he requested to resign from his position in the cabinet was directly caused by a decision issued by Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram. Pibul Songgram issued a notice on the 15th stating that Thai cabinet members should resign from all positions held in banks and industrial enterprises within this month; otherwise, he must no longer serve as a cabinet member. Nai Sarit currently runs a banking business in addition to his official duties.

　  泰国国防部长辞职
    据新华社21日讯　曼谷消息：泰国国防部长乃沙立、副部长乃他侬和内政部副部长乃巴博已经在20日同时提出辞呈，要求辞去他们在内阁中的职务。他们都是泰国陆军将领；乃沙立还兼任陆军总司令的职务。乃沙立说，他所以请求辞去内阁中的职务是由于泰国总理銮披汶所发布的一项决定直接引起的。銮披汶在15日发布的一项通告说，泰国内阁阁员应该在本月内辞去在银行和工业企业中担任的一切职务；否则，他必须不再担任内阁阁员。乃沙立目前在公职以外还经营着银行的业务。
