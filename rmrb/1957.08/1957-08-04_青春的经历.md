    A Youthful Experience
    By Our Correspondent Dai Feng
    In collective farms and state farms throughout the Soviet Union, many young men and women are working. They have just stepped out of the gates of middle and primary schools and have just started working. They are working hard while striving to learn. Pishkekova is one of them.
    Pishkekova is a milkmaid at the Lenin Collective Farm in Baryshevo Village, north of Moscow. She just turned twenty-one this spring. At the age of fifteen, after graduating from a seven-year school, she came to the collective farm and chose the job of milking cows. Six years have passed, and she has been feeding the cows wholeheartedly, early and late, resulting in high yields of milk. Especially last year, each cow she fed produced more than 4,700 kilograms of milk, far exceeding the plan. She received the honor given to her by the people at the Kremlin: the Order of the Red Banner of Labor.
    One summer morning, I visited Pishkekova in Baryshevo Village. She is strong, beautiful, and capable. In a milkmaids’ rest room, she told me about her experiences in participating in agricultural production. A wall of this rest room was covered with a list of honors. The list described the achievements of the three female members of the whole collective farm who had won medals, with Pishkekova being ranked first.
    Pishkekova said: "My experience is very ordinary, just like the thousands upon thousands of young people working on Soviet farms. In the summer of 1951, I was just a fifteen-year-old child, a singing, jumping girl. That summer, I finished seventh grade and graduated. I had two paths in front of me: further education or participating in labor production. I got my graduation certificate, and my mind was full of thoughts, and I couldn't make up my mind for a while. Because the school teachers had told us long ago that it was impossible for all graduates to go to higher education; there were not so many universities and colleges. Graduates who do not take the exam or fail the exam should participate in labor production. The labor front is waiting for us young soldiers. I also remembered my father taking me to the fields to help pull weeds and plant potato seedlings when he was alive. At that time, when my father saw that I was tired, he smiled and said, 'Physical labor is tiring, but it is also the most锻炼[duànliàn: to temper oneself; to train; to toughen; to drill]!'. His words dispelled my fatigue and made me feel the happiness of labor. My father was a collective farm member and never left the collective farm in his life."
    She went on to say that my academic performance was not bad, and if I worked harder, I would be able to get into school. But when I thought of what the teachers had said, of my father, and of the future of the collective farm, my heart was inclined to participate in production. I especially thought of what the teachers had told me, that our current collective farm is like a modern factory, and the combination of science and machines is developing rapidly in the collective farm, where strong-willed and knowledgeable people are needed. I also heard Alexandra, the socialist labor hero, tell about her experience of working as a milkmaid for twelve years. All of this attracted me, or rather, educated me. Finally, I decided to stay on the collective farm and participate in difficult physical labor."
    "I will never forget September 8th six years ago, the day I became an official member of the collective farm. The head of the dairy farm gave me four chubby cows to take care of. I touched their heads, patted their backs, and treated them like children. Four o'clock every morning was my first milking and feeding shift. I had to get up at three o'clock. The work was indeed very hard, but I was in a good mood. Because my hands are creating wealth for the people!"
    Pishkekova finally talked about her experience of self-study combined with work. She said that from the first year of work, I went to work on time every day and insisted on self-study. At the beginning, I used almost all my spare time to read books and reports about raising dairy cows. Sometimes, I read books but didn't understand, so I asked others for advice, and I persisted in this way for more than two years. It is not easy to insist on learning in work, but once you persist, the results will be very significant. For example, now I manage sixteen dairy cows, and every dairy cow is fat, and the milk production is increasing day by day. Now I am very happy because the facts have proved that the path I chose to participate in physical labor production is correct. My knowledge has been enriched, my practical experience has increased, and more importantly, my will has become stronger.
    Pishkekova also introduced me to two girls: twenty-one-year-old Nina and eighteen-year-old Lida. They had also recently graduated from school and came to the farm as milkmaids. Nina said first, "We heard from the China program on Moscow Radio that you also have many middle and primary school graduates who, like us, are participating in agricultural labor production. This is great."
    Nina graduated from a ten-year school two years ago and did not get into university. She came to the collective farm with other young men and women, and she chose the job of milkmaid. At the beginning, she only managed five dairy cows, but now, like Pishkekova, she manages sixteen dairy cows. Nina went on to say that her choice to participate in physical labor production was completely correct. Two years ago, although she was a graduate of a ten-year school, she had some book knowledge in her mind, and some were just empty fantasies. Two years of practical labor seem to have turned her into another girl. She has become a girl who combines book knowledge and practical experience, and who combines innocence and enthusiasm with a firm will. Now she has begun to review her lessons and prepare to take the university entrance exam in the next few years.
    The youngest Lida listened quietly to others speaking, and when she heard something she liked, she raised her arms, rolled her eyes, and made a face. She also came to the collective farm to work voluntarily after graduating from a seven-year school at the age of fifteen. She has been here for three full years. She said that she has a deep affection for her work. She will not go anywhere in the next few years, and all she thinks about is feeding the cows better and increasing milk production quickly. She said: "We are competing with the United States! We have proposed that our milk production must catch up with the United States. How interesting and meaningful this work is!"
    Comrades from the collective farm management office accompanied me back from the dairy farm, and we met a large group of young men and women on the road. The comrades from the management office said that they had all participated in production after graduating from middle and primary schools. His words were full of pride. There are so many knowledgeable young people in the collective farm, and everyone is working hard and working together to try to catch up with the United States. How can this not be a source of pride!

    青春的经历
    本报记者　戴枫
    在苏联各地的集体农庄和国营农场里，都有许多青年男女在那里劳动着。他们是刚跨出中、小学校的大门，才走上劳动岗位的。他们一面积极劳动，一面努力学习。彼雪科娃就是其中的一个。
    彼雪科娃是莫斯科北郊巴里雪夫村列宁集体农庄的一个女挤奶员。今年春天刚满二十一岁。十五岁那年，她在七年制学校毕业后就来到了集体农庄，选择了挤牛乳的工作。六个年头过去了，她一直早出晚归，专心喂养奶牛，使得奶牛获得了高额产量。尤其是去年，她喂养的每条奶牛生产了四千七百多公斤奶，远远超过了计划。她在克里姆林宫接受了人民给予她的荣誉：劳动红旗勋章。
    一个夏天的早晨，我到巴里雪夫村去访问了彼雪科娃。她健壮、漂亮而能干。在一间挤奶员的休息室里，她向我谈起了她参加农业生产的经历。这间休息室的墙壁上张贴着一张光荣榜。榜上叙述着全农庄三个女庄员荣获勋章的成绩，第一名就是彼雪科娃。
    彼雪科娃说：“我的经历非常普通，正像成千上万在苏联农庄里劳动着的青年一样。1951年夏天，那时我还是个十五岁的孩子，是个爱唱歌的、跳跳蹦蹦的姑娘。那年夏天，我读完七年级，毕业了。在我的面前摆着两条路：升学或者参加劳动生产。我拿到了毕业证书，心中千头万绪，一时拿不定主意。因为学校老师早告诉过我们，全部毕业生都要升学是不行的，没有那么多大中学校。不考的或者考不取的毕业生就应该去参加劳动生产。劳动战线上正等着我们这些青年战士。我又想起了父亲在世的时候，他带我到田地里帮助拔草、补土豆苗的事。那时父亲看见我累了就笑着说：‘体力劳动是累人的，可也是最锻炼人的呢’。他的话赶走了我的疲劳，使我感到了劳动的幸福。我父亲是个农庄庄员，一辈子没有离开农庄一步。”
    她接着说，我的学习成绩并不坏，如果加把劲，是会考取学校的。但是我一想到老师的话，想到父亲，想到农庄的未来，我的心就倾向于参加生产了。我特别想到老师们对我说过的，我们现在的农庄就像近代化的工厂一样，科学和机器的结合在农庄里很快地发展着，那里需要意志坚强的人、有知识的人。我还听到过社会主义劳动英雄阿历克姗甫娜讲述过的她做了十二年挤奶员的经历。这一切都吸引了我，更正确地说是教育了我。最后我决定留在农庄，参加坚苦的体力劳动。”
    “我永远忘不了六年前的9月8日，那是我成为正式农庄庄员的一天。奶牛饲养场场长分给了我四条胖胖的奶牛要我照管。我摸摸它们的头，拍拍它们的背，像对待孩子一样对待它们。每天清晨四点是我上第一班挤奶和喂料的时间。三点钟就要起床。工作确是很辛苦，不过我精神很愉快。因为我的一双手在为人民创造财富呀！”
    彼雪科娃最后还谈了自学结合工作的经验，她说，从工作的第一个年头起，我每天按时上班工作，一面还坚持自学。开头，我几乎利用了全部工余时间读完了有关饲养奶牛的书籍、报告。有时，自己读了书还不懂，就请教别人，这样坚持了两年多。工作中坚持学习不容易，但一旦坚持了下来，成绩是会非常显著的。例如现在我已管理到十六条奶牛了，而且条条奶牛长得肥胖，产奶量一天天提高。现在我的心情非常高兴，因为事实证明了我选择的参加体力劳动生产的道路是正确的。我的知识充实了，实际经验增加了，还有更主要的是：意志锻炼得更坚强了。
    彼雪科娃又介绍我认识了两位姑娘：二十一岁的尼娜和十八岁的丽达。她们二人也是不久前从学校毕业后，来到农场作挤奶员的。尼娜首先说，“我们从莫斯科广播电台中国节目中听到过，你们也有许多中小学毕业生，和我们一样去参加农业劳动生产，这太好了。”
    尼娜是两年前在十年制学校毕业的，没有考上大学。她就同其他青年男女一起来到农庄，她选择了挤奶员的工作。开始她只管理五条奶牛，现在跟彼雪科娃一样，已管理十六条奶牛了。尼娜又说，她的选择参加体力劳动生产完全是正确的。两年前，虽然是十年制学校毕业生，脑子里除了一些书本知识，有些只是空空洞洞的幻想。两年的实际劳动，好像使她变成了另外一个姑娘了，她已成为一个书本知识和实际经验结合的、天真热情和意志坚定结合的姑娘了。现在她已开始复习功课，预备在明、后年考大学。
    年纪最小的丽达静静地听着别人讲话，听到高兴处臂膀一抬，翻翻眼睛，做个鬼脸。她也是十五岁从七年制学校毕业之后，自动来农庄工作的，到现在已整整三年了。她说她对工作已有了深厚的感情。两三年内那里也不去，所想的只是把奶牛喂得更好，产奶量快快增加。她说：“我们在跟美国比赛啊！我们提出了我们的产奶量一定要赶过美国。这个工作多有意思！多有意义啊！”
    农庄管理处的同志陪我从奶牛饲养场回来，路上又遇到了一大群男女青年，管理处的同志说，他们也全是在中、小学校毕业后参加生产的。他的话里充满着自豪。农庄里有这么多具有知识的青年，大家积极劳动，同心协力要努力赶过美国。这怎么不令人自豪呢！
