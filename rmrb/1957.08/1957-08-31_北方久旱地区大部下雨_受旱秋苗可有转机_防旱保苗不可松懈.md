    Extensive Rainfall in Most Drought-Stricken Areas of Northern China
    Autumn Crops May Have a Chance to Recover; Drought Prevention and Seedling Protection Cannot Be Relaxed
    (Our Dispatch) Since August 24th, most areas or parts of areas in the long-drought-stricken provinces of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Shandong have experienced successive rainfall. Areas with heavy rainfall have been relieved of the threat of drought, while some areas still face drought conditions. In the Xin County and Yanbei Special Districts of Shanxi, rainfall began on August 26th, extending to central Shanxi from the 27th to the 28th. Rainfall was substantial in Xin County and Yanbei Special Districts, generally exceeding fifty millimeters, and the soil is basically saturated. Central areas generally received about ten millimeters of rainfall.
    North of Yan'an in Shaanxi Province, there were two rainfalls from August 24th to 26th. Yulin, Suide, and Yan'an received thirty millimeters of rainfall, while Shenmu and Hengshan received thirty-eight to fifty-five millimeters. Although areas south of Yan'an also received rain, the rainfall was very light.
    The western region of Inner Mongolia experienced three days of rain starting on August 24th. The area around Hohhot and Pingdiquan Administrative Region had the heaviest rainfall, with five to sixty millimeters. The Ikezhao League had thirty to forty millimeters, while the Bayannur League and Ulanqab League also had ten to twenty millimeters of rain.
    Most areas of Gansu Province received rain from August 24th to 26th. Lanzhou area received forty-one millimeters of rainfall. In the drought-stricken areas of central Gansu, Jingyuan, Yongdeng, Huining, Yuzhong, Yanchi, and other places received fifteen to eighteen millimeters of rainfall, Linxia received twenty-eight millimeters, and some counties in the Zhangye Special District also experienced varying degrees of rainfall.
    Areas north of the Yellow River in Shandong Province received rain on August 24th, and some areas south of the Yellow River also experienced rainfall from August 26th to 28th. The Dezhou and Huimin Special Districts and the Tai'an area had the heaviest rainfall, while the Shandong Peninsula and central and southern Shandong generally received about twenty-five millimeters of rainfall.
    Most areas in the aforementioned provinces have not had a thorough rain since July, and some areas have not even seen light rain. Although the autumn crops in these areas have been subjected to drought relief efforts by local governments, Party committees, and the masses of farmers, most autumn crops have not grown well due to the drought, and some are in critical condition. This rainfall will have a significant impact on the growth and recovery of the affected autumn crops. Most areas of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, and other provinces are still about two months away from frost. If autumn vegetables are replanted in dryland fields after this rainfall, there can still be a certain harvest. Most of these provinces have autumn planting tasks, and this rainfall is extremely beneficial for autumn cultivation and planting. The pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia are most afraid of autumn droughts. Local herders have the experience that "spring drought is not considered a drought, but autumn drought breaks the roots." This rainfall is also very valuable for the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia.
    Although the aforementioned areas have experienced successive rainfall, most areas of Henan Province and Shaanxi Province, where drought conditions are severe, as well as parts of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces and regions, are still threatened by drought. Farmers in these areas have not relaxed their struggle against drought and for seedling protection because of the rainfall in nearby areas. In the Xinyang and Luoyang areas of Henan, thousands upon thousands of people have been drawing water to irrigate autumn crops every day in late August.

    北方久旱地区大部下雨
    受旱秋苗可有转机　防旱保苗不可松懈
    本报讯　久旱的山西、陕西、内蒙古、甘肃、山东等省的大部地区或部分地区从8月24日以后陆续下雨，雨大的地区已解除干旱的威胁，部分地区仍有旱象。山西忻县、雁北两专区8月26日开始降雨，降雨范围在27日至28日延及山西中部。忻县、雁北两专区雨量较大，一般在五十毫米以上，已基本下透；中部地区一般降雨十毫米左右。
    陕西延安以北地区8月24日至26日下了两次雨，榆林、绥德、延安降雨三十毫米，神木、横山降雨三十八毫米到五十五毫米。延安以南的地区虽然也下了雨，但是雨量很小。
    内蒙古西部地区从8月24日起下了三天雨。呼和浩特、平地泉行政区一带下雨最大，雨量有五、六十毫米，伊克昭盟有三、四十毫米，巴彦淖尔盟、乌兰察布盟也有十—二十毫米的雨量。
    甘肃大部地区从8月24日至26日下雨。兰州地区降雨四十一毫米，中部干旱地区的靖远、永登、会宁、榆中、盐池等地降雨十五到十八毫米，临夏二十八毫米，张掖专区的一些县也都程度不同的下了雨。
    山东黄河以北地区8月24日下雨，黄河以南的部分地区26日—28日也随着降雨。德州、惠民两专区和泰安一带雨量较大，山东半岛、鲁中南等地降雨量一般在二十五毫米左右。
    上述这些省的大部地区自7月以来就没有下过透雨，有的地区就是小雨也没有见过。这些地区的秋苗虽然经过当地的政府、党委和农民群众的抗旱抢救，但是大部秋苗因旱生长不好，部分秋苗陷于垂危。这场雨对受害秋苗的生长和复苏都有重大的作用。山西、陕西、山东等省的大部地区距霜冻还有两个月左右，如果趁这次雨后在旱地庄稼的地里补种秋菜，还能有一定的收成。这些省多数地区都有秋种的任务，这场雨对秋耕、秋种也是极有利的。内蒙古牧区是最怕秋旱的。当地牧民都有“春旱不算旱，秋旱连根断”的经验。对内蒙古牧区说这场雨也是很宝贵的。
    上述地区虽然陆续下了雨，但是旱象严重的河南省和陕西省的大部地区以及山西、内蒙古等省、区部分地区仍受着干旱的威胁。这些地区的农民并没有因为附近下雨而放松了抗旱保苗的斗争。河南信阳、洛阳两区的许多县在8月下旬每天都有上千成万的群众取水浇秋。
