　　Understanding the New Face of National Construction
　　Shanghai Universities Send Over 3,000 Teachers to Visit Various Places

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 20th. The summer vacation visits for more than 3,000 teachers from Shanghai universities have begun successively. Yesterday, a Northwest visiting group of more than 40 people set off for places such as Luoyang, Lanzhou, and Xi'an.

    The participants in this visit are mainly older teachers with the rank of lecturer or above, as well as a small number of research staff from the Academy of Sciences and middle school teachers. In addition to organizing three visiting groups to understand the face of China's industrial construction in Central South, Northwest, and Anhui, the rest of the teachers and scientific researchers will visit factories, agricultural cooperatives, workers' residential areas, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai's land, sea, and air forces in the city.

    Through this visit, the teachers will use the facts they have seen with their own eyes to completely shatter the right-wing elements' shameless slander and defamation of the Party and the socialist system.

　　上海高等学校三千多教师到各地参观
    新华社上海20日电　上海各高等学校教师三千多人的暑期参观访问活动，已经陆续开始。昨天，由四十余人组成的西北参观团已动身去洛阳、兰州、西安等地。
    参加此次访问活动的主要是讲师以上的年老教师，也有小部分科学院研究人员和中等学校教师随同前往。他们除组织了三个参观团，分别到中南、西北、安徽等地了解我国工业建设面貌外，其余更多的教师和科学研究人员则在本市各工厂、农业社、工人住宅区以及解放军驻沪陆海空部队参观访问。
    通过这次访问，教师们将用亲眼看到的事实，彻底粉碎右派分子对党和对社会主义制度的无耻诽谤和污蔑。
