Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 25th. More than ten construction sections in Chongqing's construction industry have cadres who eat, live, work, study, and enjoy themselves with the workers. The cadres in these sections have voluntarily abolished cadre mess halls and cadre dormitories and regularly participate in physical labor every week. When workers study political affairs or hold production and safety meetings, they participate in the workers' groups, explaining certain difficult-to-understand issues in political study, or listening to workers' opinions on production, life, and study; they also play with the workers during breaks.

Because the cadres and workers labor together and live together, the relationship between the two sides is even more harmonious. The section chief, foreman, and health and technical cadres of the Fifth Section of the 403rd Work Area of the Chongqing Fourth Construction Engineering Company take turns going to the dormitory every day to understand the workers' sleep situation, swat mosquitoes, put down mosquito nets, and cover the workers with quilts, solving the mosquito net problem for workers who do not have mosquito nets. The workers in this section also deeply love the cadres. Several times it rained, and the section chief and foreman asked the workers to stop work, but the workers not only did not stop, but when they saw that the section and work chiefs were not wearing rain gear, they gave their own rain gear to the section and work chiefs. Because the cadres have achieved sharing weal and woe with the masses and promptly solved practical problems in production and life, the workers' production enthusiasm has been increasing day by day. Some units that had not been performing well in the past are now creating excellent results.

　　重庆部分工段干部树立新作风
　　和工人同吃同住同劳动
　　群众情绪高涨　生产成绩良好
    新华社重庆25日电　重庆市建筑业中有十多个建筑工段的干部，做到和工人同吃同住同劳动同学习同娱乐。这些工段的干部先后自动取消了干部伙食团和干部宿舍，每周定期参加体力劳动。当工人学习政治时事或开生产、安全会议时，他们都分别参加到工人小组中去，或者解释政治学习中某些不易理解的问题，或者听取工人对生产、生活学习方面的意见；休息时间，也和工人一起玩。
    由于干部和工人共同劳动、一起生活，双方的感情更加融洽。重庆第四建筑工程公司四○三工区五工段的段长、工长和卫生、技术干部，每天轮流在宿舍里了解工人睡眠的情况，替工人打蚊虫、放帐帘、盖被子，替没有蚊帐的工人解决蚊帐问题。这个工段的工人也十分爱戴干部。有几次下雨，段长、工长叫工人收工，工人不但不收工，看见工、段长没戴雨具，反而把自己雨具让给段长、工长用。因为干部做到了和群众同甘共苦，及时解决生产、生活中的实际问题，工人的生产热情日趋高涨。有些过去完成任务不大好的单位，现在都创造了很好的成绩。
