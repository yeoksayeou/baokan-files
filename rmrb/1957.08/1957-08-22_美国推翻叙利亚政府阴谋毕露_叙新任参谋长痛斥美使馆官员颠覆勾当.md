Xinhua News Agency, August 21st dispatch from Damascus: Syria's new Chief of Staff, Bizri, accused the United States on August 20th of plotting to overthrow the current Syrian regime.

	The 43-year-old Major General, in a meeting with a group of Western journalists, said that the American plot included the assassination of himself, the new Deputy Chief of Staff Brigadier General Nifuri, and the Director of Intelligence of the General Staff, Colonel Sarraj. He said: "The main purpose is to kill staff officers who oppose American policy. They want the heads of every upright person, and we have evidence."

	Bizri accused Howard Stone, the Second Secretary of the American Embassy, of being the mastermind behind this planned assassination. He said that the assassinations were to be carried out by "American-made bandits."

	A reporter asked him where these "bandits" were trained. Bizri replied, "You better go to Jordan and Lebanon to ask, go there and ask who is funding them."

	Bizri also strongly criticized Colonel Robert Molloy, the American Embassy's military attaché who had already been expelled from Syria. He said that Molloy "thinks we are an inferior race, what he said is exactly the same as what Hitler said when he was in power."

	Bizri explained that ten military officers had recently been dismissed because "we have evidence that they were interfering in politics."

	When explaining the reason for appointing army officers to command the police and gendarmerie, Bizri said that the army has a very close relationship with national security, so the government felt it necessary to do so.

	When asked about the news circulating abroad that the Syrian army had taken control of the government, Bizri replied, "Ask our Foreign Minister! No one can force him to do work he doesn't want to do. He is doing his job very happily."

	A reporter asked Bizri about his own political beliefs. Bizri cited the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that one country is not allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of another country. He said, "What I see now is that you not only want to interfere in our internal affairs, but also want to interfere in our private affairs."

	Bizri said, "If you can interpret everyone who loves their motherland as a communist, then I am a communist." Then he said, "No one can interfere with whether people want to believe in communism or fascism." He said: "I will not sacrifice the interests of my country for the sake of other countries."

	In the 90-minute conversation, a reporter also asked about Syria's purchase of Soviet weapons. He said, "This is our own business, and only our own business. If the United States sells us weapons, we are also willing to buy them."

　　美国推翻叙利亚政府阴谋毕露
　  叙新任参谋长痛斥美使馆官员颠覆勾当
    据新华社21日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚新任陆军参谋长比兹里8月20日指责美国阴谋推翻叙利亚现政权。
    这位四十三岁的少将在接见一批西方记者时说，美国的阴谋中包括暗杀他本人、新任陆军副参谋长尼福里准将和总参谋部情报处长萨拉杰上校。他说：“主要的目的是杀害反对美国政策的参谋军官。他们要每一个正直的人的脑袋，我们握有证据。”
    比兹里指责美国大使馆二等秘书霍华德·斯通是这一有计划的暗杀的主谋人。他说，暗杀的行动是要由“美国制的匪徒”来执行的。
    记者问他，这些“匪徒”在哪里受训。比兹里回答说：“你最好还是到约旦和黎巴嫩去问，到那里去问到底是谁在资助他们。”
    比兹里还强烈抨击已经被叙利亚驱逐出境的美国大使馆武官罗伯特·莫洛伊上校。他说，莫洛伊“认为我们是下等民族，希特勒得势时所说的话和他说的完全一样”。
    比兹里说明，最近有十名军官被解除职务是因为“我们有证据证明他们在干预政治”。
    比兹里解释任命陆军军官统率警察和宪兵的原因时说，陆军同国家治安有十分密切的关系，因此政府认为有必要这样做。
    谈到国外所传叙利亚军队已经控制了政府的消息时，比兹里回答说：“去问问我们的外交部长吧！谁也不能强迫他做他所不愿意做的工作。他很愉快地在做自己的工作。”
    有记者问到比兹里自己的政治信仰。比兹里引证了联合国宪章，宪章规定不准一个国家干涉另外一个国家的内政。他说：“现在我看到的情况是，你不仅想干涉我们的内政，而且是要干涉我们的私事。”
    比兹里说：“如果你能把每一个热爱自己祖国的人都解释为共产主义者，那么我是一个共产主义者。”接着他又说：“不管人家是要信仰共产主义还是法西斯主义，没有人能干与这些事情。”他说：“我不会为了别的国家而牺牲自己国家的利益。”
    在历时九十分钟的谈话中，还有记者问到叙利亚购买苏联武器的事情。他说：“这是我们自己的事情，也仅仅是我们自己的事情。如果美国卖给我们武器，我们也愿意买。”
