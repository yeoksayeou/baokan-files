This reporter, Yu Ming, reports:

	According to revealed materials, there was a not-so-small right-wing anti-Party group within the Anhui Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Members of this group included: Dai Yue, Wang Ying, Qian Feng, Shi Qing, Geng Longxiang, Luo Qiufan, Jia Menglei, Liu Junming, Lü Bochou, Cao Yumo, Wu Wenhui, Xie Jingcheng, Zhang Yu, Wu Chenqie, and others. Among them were traitors, rogues, renegades, Hu Feng elements, and individuals who had participated in reactionary party groups and harbored long-term dissatisfaction with the Party. They controlled the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, seized control of the "Jianghuai Literature" editorial department, and turned "Jianghuai Literature" into an anti-Party tool. Before the Great Blooming and Great Debate, they began to release poisonous arrows in "Jianghuai Literature," spreading anti-Party rhetoric. During the Great Blooming and Great Debate, their arrogance in attacking the Party became even more rampant, turning the literary and art circles of Anhui into a miasma.

	**Gathering People Dissatisfied with the Party**

	People can't help but ask, why were so many demons and monsters concentrated within the Anhui Federation of Literary and Art Circles? This should be "credited" to Dai Yue, the "commander" of this anti-Party group. He used his authority as the Deputy Director of the Provincial Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education to win over, and even search out, people who catered to his liking, placing them in the Anhui Federation of Literary and Art Circles, glorifying it as implementing the Party's "United Front." Dai Yue painstakingly brought the traitor Wu Wenhui, who had betrayed comrades and organizations, Luo Qiufan, and the Hu Feng element Zhang Yu, to work at the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Without organizational study, he arbitrarily appointed the traitor Luo Qiufan as Deputy Director of the Creative Writing Committee. He greatly valued Peng Bai and Zhu Xiangqun, but both of these individuals were counter-revolutionaries and were arrested during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He handed over "Jianghuai Literature" to Wang Ying, Shi Qing, the rogue Qian Feng, and Lü Bochou and the traitor Wu Wenhui, who were extremely dissatisfied with the Party, and others who had political historical problems. He squeezed out Tao Tao, Ge Yan, Cheng Kewen, and others who disagreed with him from the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and thus Dai's "United Front" was formed. Under Dai Yue's leadership, this group of people usually flattered each other, boasted to each other, neglected their duties, played cards and made merry, drank and made trouble, insulted women, distorted the Party's policies, and brought the Party branch to a state of disintegration.

	The right-wing anti-Party elements of the Anhui Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles usually spread all kinds of remarks, hated socialism, and slandered and attacked the leadership of the Party. Wang Ying slandered the Party's promotion of democracy as "decoration," and he openly declared that he "no longer wants to be such a democratic decoration." They concentrated their attacks on the Party's work in rural areas. Liu Junming said: "The unified purchase and sales system has made it so that farmers who grow crops have no grain to eat." Cao Yumo even spread rumors, saying: "The current countryside is where trees are cut down, chickens are killed, and children are being robbed." Geng Longxiang believed that "rural work is all done by coercion." They were extremely opposed to the Party's leadership. Qian Feng often said: "The Party's life restricts creative freedom," and Wang Ying also believed that the Party's leadership restricted their journal from "forming its own style and school."

	**"Jianghuai Literature" Becomes an Anti-Party Tool**

	Their anti-Party, anti-socialist remarks not only flooded the internal organs of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, but from January of this year, they used "Jianghuai Literature" to peddle poison to readers in accordance with their bourgeois views. In the first and second issues of "Jianghuai Literature" this year, they continuously published several articles that opposed depicting realistic revolutionary struggles, promoted love above all else and pornography, and also published works that so-called "exposed the dark side of life." For example, "Starting from a Comment" and "A Bundle of Reflections" published in the second issue of "Jianghuai Literature" opposed literary and artistic works reflecting realistic revolutionary struggles and depicting workers, peasants, and soldiers, saying that this was dogmatism. In the same issue, they also published works that "exposed the dark side of life," "In Drought Days" and "Occasional News from Fengtai." The former went to great lengths to slander rural cadres and peasants, depicting the rural areas after collectivization as completely dark, while the latter said: "Marry a cadre and you'll get a quilt, marry a worker and you'll eat and drink and sleep. If you want to find a partner, go to Huainan (mining area), so you don't have to marry a farmer and work hard all year round." Deliberately promoting the differences between the lives of workers and peasants, creating contradictions between workers and peasants.

	In March, after the Anhui Daily published Lin Luoli's "What Thought is Leading the 'Jianghuai Literature' Editorial Department?" they not only did not regard it as a beneficial piece of advice and humbly examine their mistakes, but instead treated this criticism with a hostile attitude. Dai Yue immediately said within the Federation of Literary and Art Circles that this was "the Provincial Party Committee secretly dealing with the Federation of Literary and Art Circles," inciting people from the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to oppose the Provincial Party Committee. He assigned Qian Feng to the Anhui Daily to question the author of the article and proposed to "persist in counter-criticism." From then on, the anti-Party elements of the Anhui Federation of Literary and Art Circles, under the command of Dai Yue, launched a large-scale attack on the Party. They wrote a "complaint" to the Party Central Committee, prepared to print and distribute a "Letter of Appeal," sought assistance from neighboring provinces, threatened the Anhui Daily to publish their false self-criticisms, and insisted that the Provincial Party Committee had made mistakes in implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, calling them "opponents of the Central Committee." They refused to admit their bourgeois views and called all criticisms and critics "dogmatism."

	The Provincial Party Committee held a meeting in April to discuss this criticism, pointed out the necessity of criticizing the "Jianghuai Literature" editorial department, pointed out some shortcomings in the criticism methods, and made a correct conclusion. However, the anti-Party elements of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, under the behind-the-scenes instigation of Dai Yue at the provincial propaganda conference in May, launched another frenzied attack on the Party, completely overturning the original correct conclusion of the Provincial Party Committee. They organized and wrote forty or fifty articles, attacking the leadership of the Party and the socialist system, making "Jianghuai Literature" even more right-leaning. Until July, when the attacks of the national right-wing elements had been counterattacked, the articles they published in "Jianghuai Literature's" "Free Talk" and "Rose Garden" were still almost all poisonous. They also planned to use the August issue as a "bomb" to attack the Party, but the conspiracy was not realized due to exposure.

	**Openly Opposing the Leadership of the Party**

	During the frenzied attacks on the Party by right-wing elements, they openly proposed opposing the Party's leadership over literature and art. Shi Qing said: "The Party can lead literature and art, but it also cannot lead literature and art." Lü Bochou advocated "free association," turning "Jianghuai Literature" into a "journal of colleagues"; Liu Junming, in his article "What is Meant by Letting Go and Contending with Leadership," believed that the Party only needs to propose guidelines. If leadership is still carried out during the letting go and contending, it will hinder the letting go and contending. Luo Qiufan and Wang Ying, in their "Preliminary Discussion on Letting Go and Reining In" and "Casual Talk on 'Having a Clear Idea'" published in "Jianghuai Literature," both advocated that the journal's editorial department should not have a clear proletarian stance.

	They were also more enthusiastic about "exposing the dark side of life." In "Decayed Tooth," published in the July issue of "Jianghuai Literature," they advocated removing veteran cadres (actually referring to the Party) like "decayed teeth"; in "The Words of an Old Farmer," they slandered the Party for forgetting the peasants, saying that our cadres are now "working in tall buildings, with guards standing in front of the door," the two doors and windows are "closed," and "orders" are floating down from "high-rise buildings," in order to provoke the relationship between the Party and the masses. In "'Greenhouse' Creators," they slandered section chiefs and division chiefs as being the "protective wall" of the leaders, all being petty people who were promoted by flattering the leaders. Wang Ying, the deputy director of the editorial department, said: "'Jianghuai Literature' can cooperate in opposing the three evils and dogmatism, but it is not easy to cooperate in opposing right-wingers." After Sichuan's Liu Shahe's "Grass and Wood Chapter" was criticized everywhere, Shi Qing, the deputy editor-in-chief of "Jianghuai Literature," even said: "Liu Shahe has been criticized, we support him. If others don't want his manuscripts, we will go and ask him for manuscripts!" Although Liu Shahe's manuscript has not yet appeared in "Jianghuai Literature," Chu Yitian's "People Who Dare Not See the Sun," who colluded with Liu Shahe, has already been published in the July issue of "Jianghuai Literature," and this work is full of poison. According to preliminary inspection, about one-quarter of the articles published in "Jianghuai Literature" from January to July were poisonous, and it truly became the anti-Party "tool" of the Dai Yue group.

	Why do these people hate the Party so much? Even Dai Yue, who was the Deputy Director of the Department of Culture and Education, confessed that because he was not elected as a member of the Provincial Party Committee last year, his promotion was only to the eleventh level, and this year he was not allowed to participate in the national propaganda conference, he "deepened his determination to oppose the Party."

	Wang Ying's hatred is even deeper. Under the guise of opposing dogmatism, he shouted "A gentleman takes revenge, three years is not too late." He shouted that "the leadership of the Party has caused disasters." He said wildly: "If I were a warlord, I would kill the bureaucrats (?) and steam them in a steamer!" He said: "I oppose everything the Party advocates, and I admire everything the Party opposes."

	**Brilliant "Tactics"**

	Dai Yue said that his behind-the-scenes activities were tactical. These tactics: first, use the legitimacy of letting go and contending to secretly encourage right-wing elements to oppose the Party; second, support anti-Party elements; third, win sympathy; fourth, organize and encourage others to speak out against the Party. As for himself, it's "better if I don't speak." These are truly brilliant "tactics"! But these "tactics" have finally gone bankrupt. Wang Ying said: The right-wing elements of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles have been "unprecedentedly united" since they frantically attacked the Party. He said that they are "like a nest of wasps, the Party can set fire to it, but it cannot disperse it." Wang Ying said too confidently, the people have the power to disperse you. If you are not dispersed by fighting, then you really have to be "burned by fire," which is called "playing with fire and getting burned."

　　戴记“统一战线”破产了
　　本报记者　于明
    据已揭发的材料，安徽省文联有一个不小的右派反党集团。参加这个集团的是：戴岳、王影、钱锋、石青、耿龙祥、罗秋帆、贾梦雷、刘俊明、吕伯俦、曹玉模、吴文慧、谢竟成、张禹、吴晨茄等。他们当中有汉奸、流氓、叛徒、胡风分子，有参加过反动党团和对党长期不满的分子。他们控制了省文联、掌握了“江淮文学”编辑部，把“江淮文学”变成反党的工具。在大放大鸣之前，他们就开始在“江淮文学”上施放毒箭，散布反党言论，在大放大鸣期间，向党进攻的气焰更为嚣张，把安徽文艺界搅得乌烟瘴气。
    搜罗对党不满的人
    人们不禁要问，为什么安徽文联内部的牛鬼蛇神如此集中？这要“归功”于这个反党集团的“主帅”戴岳。他利用省委文教部副部长的职权，拉拢、甚至搜罗投其所好的人，安插在安徽文联，美其名曰执行党的“统一战线”。戴岳把出卖过同志、出卖过组织的叛徒吴文慧、罗秋帆，以及胡风分子张禹，千方百计拉到文联工作。他未经组织研究，便擅自任命叛徒罗秋帆为创作委员会副主任。他很重用彭拜、祝向群，但是这两个人都是反革命分子，在肃反时都被逮捕了。他把“江淮文学”交给有政治历史问题的王影、石青，流氓钱锋，和对党极为不满的吕伯俦、叛徒吴文慧等的手里。他把与他意见不合的陶滔、戈焰、程克文等都排挤出文联，于是戴记“统一战线”便组成了。他们这一伙人，在戴岳带领下，平时互相捧场，彼此吹嘘；不务正业，打牌作乐；酗酒闹事，侮辱妇女；歪曲党的政策，使党支部处于瓦解状态。
    安徽省文联的右派反党分子，平常就散布种种言论，仇视社会主义，污蔑和攻击党的领导。王影污蔑党发扬民主是为了“点缀”，他公然声明，他“不愿再作这样的民主点缀品”了。他们集中地攻击了党在农村的工作。刘俊明说：“统购统销搞得种庄稼的农民没有粮食吃。”曹玉模竟造谣说：“现在的农村是树砍光、鸡杀光，小孩都在遭劫”。耿龙祥则认为“农村工作都是用强迫命令搞起来的。”他们极端反对党的领导，钱锋常说：“党的生活约束了创作自由”，王影也认为党的领导束缚了他们的刊物“形成自己的风格和流派。”
    “江淮文学”成为反党工具
    他们反党、反社会主义的言论，不仅在文联机关内部泛滥，从今年1月份起，就按照他们的资产阶级观点，利用“江淮文学”向读者贩运毒素了。他们在今年一、二两期的“江淮文学”上，连续刊载了好几篇反对描写现实革命斗争，宣扬爱情至上和色情的文章，还刊登了所谓“揭露生活阴暗面”的作品。如第二期“江淮文学”发表的“从一条评语谈起”、“杂感一捆”，就反对文艺作品反映现实革命斗争，描写工农兵，说这是教条主义。在同一期上，又发表了“揭露生活阴暗面”的作品“在干旱的日子里”，“凤台偶闻”，前者对农村干部和农民极尽污蔑能事，把合作化后的农村描写得一团漆黑，后者则说：“嫁给干部一床被，嫁给工人吃喝睡，要找对象淮南去（工矿区），免得嫁农民终年累。”刻意宣传工农生活的不同，制造工农之间的矛盾。
    3月份，安徽日报发表了林洛里写的“什么思想在领导‘江淮文学’编辑部？”一文后，他们不但不把它当作有益的忠告，虚心检查错误，反而以敌对态度看待这一批评。戴岳立刻就在文联内部说，这是“省委背地搞文联”，煽动文联的人来反对省委。他指派钱锋到安徽日报质问文章的作者，并提出要“坚持反批评”。从此安徽文联的反党分子，就在戴岳指挥下，大举向党发动了进攻。他们向党中央写
  “控告”，准备印发“呼吁书”，向邻省求援，威胁安徽日报登载他们的假检讨，他们咬定省委在执行百花齐放、百家争鸣方针上犯了错误，是“中央的反对派”，他们死不承认自己的资产阶级观点，把所有批评和批评者，一概称之为“教条主义”。
    省委在4月曾召开会议，对这一批评进行讨论，并指出对“江淮文学”编辑部批评的必要性，指出了批评方法上的一些缺点，作出了正确的结论。但是文联的反党分子，在5月全省宣传会议时在戴岳幕后策动下却又一次发动了向党的猖狂进攻，全部推翻了省委原来的正确结论。他们一下组织和写了四五十篇文章，攻击党的领导，攻击社会主义制度，把“江淮文学”办得更向右转。直到7月，全国右派分子的进攻已受到反击，他们在“江淮文学”的“自由谈”“玫瑰园”里所发表的文章，却仍几乎是全部有毒的东西。他们还计划把8月号作为向党进攻的“炸弹”，终因阴谋败露没有实现。
　  公然反对党的领导
    在右派分子向党猖狂进攻期间，他们公然提出了反对党对文艺的领导。石青说：“党能领导文艺，也不能领导文艺。”吕伯俦主张“自由结合”，把“江淮文学”变为“同人刊物”；刘俊明在“何谓有领导的放和鸣”一文中，认为党只提出方针就行了，如果在鸣放中还进行领导，就是阻碍鸣放。罗秋帆、王影在“江淮文学”所发表的“试论放与收”、“闲话‘心中有数’”，都主张刊物编辑部不要有显明的无产阶级立场。
    他们对“揭露生活的阴暗面”，也更加狂热了。7月号的“江淮文学”发表的一篇“蛀牙”中，主张要把老干部（实际上是指党）像“蛀牙”一样拔掉；“老农的话”中，污蔑党忘了农民，说我们的干部现在是“在大楼上办公，门前站着卫兵”，两扇门窗“关闭”，从“高楼上”飘下来“命令”，以此来挑拨党群关系。“‘温床’的制造者”一文中，污蔑处、科长都是首长的“护身墙”，都是凭对首长的阿谀奉迎才得到提拔的小人。编辑部副主任王影说：“江淮文学”反三害、反教条主义可以配合，反右派不好配合”。四川流沙河的“草木篇”受到各地批判以后，“江淮文学”副主编石青还说：“流沙河挨了批评，我们支持他，别人不要它的稿子，我们要去向他约稿！”流沙河的稿子虽然还没有在“江淮文学”上露面，而和流沙河狼狈为奸的储一天的“不敢见太阳的人”一文，却已登在7月号“江淮文学”上了，这篇作品有浓厚的毒素。据初步检查，“江淮文学”从1月到7月份，所发表的有毒素的文章占全部文章的四分之一左右，它真正成了戴岳集团的反党“工具”。    这些人为什么这样仇恨党？连身为文教部副部长的戴岳都招认说，他因为在去年没有选上省委委员，提级只提到十一级，今年全国宣传会议又没有让他去参加，他就“更加深了反党的决心”。
    王影的仇恨更深，他在反对教条主义的幌子下，喊出了“君子报仇，三年不晚”，他大叫“党的领导造成了灾害”，他猖狂地说：“我要是军阀，就要把官僚主义者（？）杀了用蒸笼来蒸！”他说：“党所提倡的东西我都反对，党所反对的东西我都欣赏。”
    绝妙的“策略”
    戴岳说他的幕后活动是有策略的，这些略策：一是利用鸣放的合法性暗暗鼓动右派分子反党；二是赞助反党分子；三是争取同情；四是组织、鼓励别人发言反党。至于他自己则是“我不讲话的好”。这真是绝妙的“策略”！但是这种“策略”终于破产了。王影说：文联的右派分子，自从向党猖狂进攻以来，是“空前团结了”，他说，他们“犹如一窝马蜂，党可以放火烧掉它，却打不散它。”王影说得太自信了，人民是有力量打散你们的，如果打而不散，那你们就真得要被“火烧掉”了，那就叫做“玩火自焚”。
