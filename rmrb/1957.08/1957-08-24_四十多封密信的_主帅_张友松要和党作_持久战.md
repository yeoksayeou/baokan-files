Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd: Zhang Yousong, disguised as a professional translator, was originally a ferocious wolf. Zhang Yousong's true colors have been fully exposed in the three capital publishing industry symposiums held on the 14th, 16th, and 21st of this month. More than twenty people spoke at the three meetings.

Zhang Yousong, under the pretext of helping the Party rectify its work style, launched an organized and planned attack on the Communist Party. He claimed to have opened up two "battlefields," one in the publishing industry (with People's Literature Publishing House as the main target) and the other at Shandong Normal College.

In his attack on the publishing industry, Zhang Yousong colluded with Xiao Qian. At the symposiums held by the Ministry of Culture and the People's Literature Publishing House respectively, he described the people's publishing cause as completely dark.

Before liberation, Zhang Yousong only translated some English-Chinese small booklets. After liberation, due to the establishment of a commission relationship with the People's Literature Publishing House, he was able to start translating some large books in a more planned way with the help of the publishing house. In the past three and a half years, he received 15,000 yuan in royalties, an average of nearly 400 yuan per month. Although the publishing department took very good care of him, he still often clamored for financial difficulties, saying he had "no rice to cook." When the People's Literature Publishing House prepaid him 1,500 yuan in royalties for a revised edition in May of this year at his request, this wolf repaid kindness with hatred, biting the hand that fed him, maliciously smearing the publishing house's meticulous care for him as "sugar-coated bullets" to "shut his mouth" and prevent him from raising further opinions. He also wrote to his accomplices in the anti-Party clique at Shandong Normal College, which he organized and directed, saying that the People's Internal Transportation Captain had sent him a batch of grain and ammunition "for the needs of a protracted war," using the prepaid royalties from the publishing house as his anti-Party "war expenses."

Attendees pointed out Zhang Yousong's rogue attitude in his confession. Zhang Yousong quibbled that his mistakes were only "petty-bourgeois ideology," "a rough attitude in the rectification campaign," and that he "really did not intend to oppose the Party." However, according to the facts revealed at the meeting, after Zhang Yousong's rightist face was exposed in the "forty-odd secret letters" article in the People's Daily on July 28, from August 2 to 9, he continued to send many carbon copies of letters to various parties, slandering the Party newspaper and wanting to wage a "protracted war" with the Party.

According to the revelations at the meeting, Zhang Yousong, who had always styled himself as a "progressive intellectual" and boasted of "thirty years of clean history," his father was originally an old bureaucrat of the Northern Warlord government, and he himself had joined the reactionary "Youth Party" as early as his student days. Before liberation, when he ran the Chun Chao Bookstore in Shanghai, he had close ties with the Trotskyites, translated Trotsky's works, published books by other Trotskyites, and even defrauded Mr. Lu Xun of five hundred yuan. When he ran a printing factory in Chongqing, he printed anti-communist pamphlets, engaged in speculative profiteering, colluded with CC secret agents to solicit business, and pulled a secret agent relative into the printing factory as a partner. Zhang Yousong, who had engaged in these shady activities, had always disguised himself as a "famous translator," a "progressive intellectual," and even a "follower of Mr. Lu Xun." Now, he has been completely exposed.

The participants of the three symposiums were extremely indignant at Zhang Yousong's vicious intentions and rogue face, and unanimously demanded that he honestly bow his head and confess his crimes, and make a thorough explanation.

### 四十多封密信的“主帅”　张友松要和党作“持久战”

    四十多封密信的“主帅”
　　张友松要和党作“持久战”
    据新华社22日讯　披着专业翻译家外衣的张友松，原来是一条凶恶的中山狼。张友松的原形，已在本月14、16和21日的三次首都出版界座谈会上被充分揭露。在三次会上发言的共有二十多人。
    张友松借口帮助党整风，向共产党发动了有组织有计划的进攻。他自称开辟了两个“战场”，一个是出版界（以人民文学出版社为主攻目标），一个是山东师范学院。
    张友松在向出版界的进攻中，是与萧乾狼狈为奸的。他在文化部和人民文学出版社分别召开的座谈会上，把人民出版事业描述成漆黑一团。
    在解放前只翻译过一些英汉对照的小册子的张友松，解放后由于和人民文学出版社建立了约稿关系，在出版社的帮助下，才能比较有计划地开始翻译些大部头的书籍。在过去三年半中，他收到稿费一万五千元，平均每月近四百元。虽然出版部门对他的照顾十分优厚，但他还经常叫嚷经济困难，“没米下锅”。当人民文学出版社在今年5月应他的要求，预付给他一千五百元重版书稿费后，这只中山狼却恩将仇报，反咬一口，把出版社对他无微不至的照顾，恶意地污蔑为“糖衣炮弹”，是为了“封住他的嘴”，不让他再提意见。他还写信给他所组织和指挥的山东师范学院反党小集团的同伙说：人民内部运输大队长已给他送来一批粮弹，“可供持久战之需”，把向出版社预支的稿费，作为他反党的“战费”。
    到会的人指出了张友松在交代中耍无赖的态度。张友松狡辩说，他的错误只是什么“小资产阶级思想”，什么“在整风中态度粗暴”，“实在不是存心反党”。但根据会上揭发的事实，张友松在7月28日人民日报“四十多封密信”一文中揭露了他的右派面目后，从8月2日到9日的几天内，还接连给各方面发出很多封复写信，诬蔑党报，要同党作“持久战”。
    根据会上的揭发，一向以“进步知识分子”自居，标榜“三十年来历史清白”的张友松，原来他父亲是一个北洋军阀政府的旧官僚，他本人早在学生时代就曾加入过反动的“青年党”。解放前，他在上海办春潮书局时，和托派有密切往来，翻译过托洛茨基的著作，出版过其他托派分子的书籍，还骗过鲁迅先生的五百块钱。他在重庆办印刷厂时，印过反共小册子，做过投机倒把的买卖，和CC特务勾搭，兜揽生意，把一个特务亲戚拉到印刷厂入伙。干过这些勾当的张友松，过去却一直把自己装扮成“名翻译家”、“进步文人”、甚至是“鲁迅先生的信徒”。现在，已完全被揭穿了。
    三次座谈会的与会者，对于张友松的恶毒心肠和无赖嘴脸都极为愤慨，一致要他老实低头认罪，作出彻底交代。
