    Message to the General
    Ji Peng
    Near Xinqiao Town in Yong'an County, Fujian Province, there is an ancient temple. In 1929, comrades Zhu De and Peng Dehuai stayed here one night on their way back from the Gutian Conference. A farmer who guarded the generals told me this: "You are a guest from Beijing, no wonder I feel so close to you. Have you ever participated in the National Day parade? Have you ever seen my respected two generals? Twenty-seven years ago, when darkness replaced sunshine, on a restless night, the two generals returned from the Gutian Conference and stayed in this dilapidated temple. I held a spear and patrolled vigilantly outside the window. The two generals talked late into the night, I don't know if they were studying how to implement the decisions of the conference? Or discussing how to create a million Red Army? The next day, before dawn had broken the night, the cool mist kissed the generals' clothes; the generals looked at the sparse villages and the sky-covering forests, describing a charming vision of happiness for the people. The generals' words ignited the fire in the hearts of millions, and people raised their knives and guns to fight to the death with the White bandits. Now, the land of the entire company belongs to the commune members, and the roar of unfamiliar trains echoes in the sea of trees. We really hope that one day, the two generals will come to this brand-new mountain area again. We will have a heart-to-heart talk with them all night long and drink heartily. We will ask them to taste the fresh honey peaches and fortune oranges. Let the beautiful girls perform the 'Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching Dance,' and let the strong young men sing 'I Love Tractors.' During the day, we will invite them to visit the golden rice fields, and at night, watch the magnificent night scene like stars falling to the ground… You, the guest from Beijing, I really don't want you to leave this happy mountain village, but I also long for you to bring my heartfelt words to my respected two generals as soon as possible."

    寄语将军
  　纪鹏
    福建省永安县新桥镇附近有座古庙，1929年，朱德、彭德怀同志参加古田会议归来，曾在这里宿过一夜。一位给将军警卫的农民，对我这样说……你是北京来的客人，怪不得见你就格外亲近，你可曾参加过国庆检阅？可曾见过我敬爱的两位将军？还是黑暗代替阳光的二十七年前在一个不宁静的晚上，两位将军从古田会议归来，就宿在这座破旧的庙堂。我手持长矛在窗外警惕巡逻，两位将军一直畅谈到夜深，不知是研究怎样贯彻会议的决议？还是讨论怎样创立百万红军？第二天，曙光还没揭开夜幕，青色的温雾亲着将军的衣裳；将军望着稀疏的村庄和遮天的森林，给人们描绘出迷人般的幸福远景。将军的话燃起千万人心里的火种，人们举起刀枪和白匪展开殊死斗争，如今，连排的土地归社员所有，树海中回荡着陌生的火车吼声。我们真希望有这么一天，两位将军再来到这崭新的山区，我们要和他们通宵畅谈，痛饮干杯，我们要请他们尝鲜美的蜜桃和福橘。让漂亮的姑娘们来个“采茶扑蝶舞”，让强壮的小伙子唱个“我爱拖拉机”，白天，请他们参观闪着金光的稻田，晚上，观看群星落地般的辉煌夜景……你这位北京来的客人，我真不愿你离开这幸福的山村，可是我又渴望你能把心里的话，早些带给我敬爱的两位将军。
