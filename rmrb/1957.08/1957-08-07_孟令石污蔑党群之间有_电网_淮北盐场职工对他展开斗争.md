    Meng Lingshi Slanders that there is an "Electric Grid" Between the Party and the Masses
    Employees of the Huaibei Salt Field Launch a Struggle Against Him

    (Our report) Nearly a thousand employees of the Huaibei Salt Field held meetings separately, vehemently denouncing the anti-Party fallacies of the rightist Meng Lingshi.

    Meng Lingshi worked in the Education Section of the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau. On May 23, in a letter to the reporter of the *Salt Worker's News* that was 5,000 characters long, he launched a vicious attack on the Party. He said, "Between the Party and non-Party members in the salt field, there is an electric grid. To pass through the electric grid, one has to risk one's life. Now, some people are coming to dismantle the electric grid, and I hope that those inside the electric grid do not discharge electricity and electrocute people to death." He also said, "The sectarianism of the Party organization in the salt field is deeply rooted and permeates down from the Party center in Beijing."

    Meng Lingshi similarly slandered the Party's policy of cultivating cadres. He said, "What the Party 'hopes will become dragons' are still Party members. Truly, 'every man for himself, and the devil take the hindmost.'" He said, "Party members are on guard against non-Party comrades 'rebelling' and becoming 'traitors' every day, as if only Party members are descendants of loyal subjects, wholeheartedly patriotic, and non-Party members are all descendants of traitors, feigning patriotism. This makes non-Party members feel like 'young daughters-in-law' in revolutionary families."

    Meng Lingshi's anti-Party fallacies were severely refuted by the broad masses of employees of the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau. Meng Zhongmou, Meng Lingshi's uncle who works in the Supply Section, refuted him, saying, "As soon as you arrived at the salt field, the Party assigned you as the chief of the printing stock, and the seal was placed in your hands. How can you say that the Party treats you like a thief?" Employee Zhu Jingyun questioned Meng Lingshi face-to-face, saying, "I personally witnessed Japanese devils installing electric grids around the forty-horsepower machines in the Dapuyantian salt fields, electrocuting several Chinese people to death, but I have never seen any electric grid between the Party and the masses after liberation. We treat the Party like our own parents. Why do you insult the Party?" After Meng Lingshi's anti-Party fallacies were denounced, he began to act shamelessly, saying, "I was merely playing with words," and declared that he wanted to retract all his statements, saying, "Just pretend I never said anything."

    孟令石污蔑党群之间有“电网”
    淮北盐场职工对他展开斗争
    本报讯　淮北盐场近千职工分别集会，痛斥右派分子孟令石的反党谬论。
    孟令石在淮北盐务局教育科工作。5月23日，他给盐工报记者长达五千字的信里，对党进行了恶毒的攻击。他说：“盐场党和非党之间隔着一道电网，要过电网非得拼着性命不可。现在有人来拆电网，希望电网里的人不要放电把人电死。”还说：“盐场党组织的宗派主义是从北京党根深蒂固的渗透下来的。”
    孟令石对党培养干部的政策同样进行污蔑。说：“党所‘望子成龙’的还是党员。真是人不为己，‘天诛地灭’。”他说：“党员天天像防贼一样，谨防非党同志‘造反’，做‘汉奸’，好像只有党员才是忠臣的苗裔，是赤胆忠心爱国的，非党员皆是卖国贼后代，爱国皆是假惺惺的，弄得非党员在革命家庭里像个‘小媳妇’”。
    孟令石反党谬论，遭到淮北盐务局广大职工的严厉驳斥。在供应科工作的孟令石叔父孟仲谋批驳说：“你一到盐场，党就分配你当文印股长，大印都放在你手里，怎能说党把你当贼”。一场职工朱景云当面责问孟令石说：“我亲眼见过日本鬼子在大浦盐田四十马力的机器四周安上电网电死过几个中国人，可没有见过解放后在党群之间还有什么电网，我们把党当作亲父母一般，你为什么辱骂党？”孟令石反党谬论遭到痛斥后，就耍起无赖说：“我仅是笔墨游戏”，并声明要收回全部发言，就“算我没有讲过”。
