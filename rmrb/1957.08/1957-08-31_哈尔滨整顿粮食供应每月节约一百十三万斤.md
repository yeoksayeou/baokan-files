    Harbin Rectifies Grain Supply, Saving 1.13 Million Jin Per Month
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Harbin City has concluded its work on rectifying the unified purchase and sale of grain. Judging from the rectification situation, the previous general supply amount was on the high side. Among collective mess halls and residents, those with excessively high supply levels accounted for 46.16% of the city's total households, while those with insufficient supplies accounted for only 5%, with the remaining households having enough to eat. Some catering industry employees were consuming grain supplied for business use; the supply standards for non-agricultural households in suburban areas were also too high; and a small number of agricultural cooperatives were using grain for sideline occupations (such as making tofu) and using food rations to feed livestock.
    During this grain unified purchase and sale rectification work, reductions were made for households with excessively high supply standards, and necessary adjustments and arrangements were made for the few households with insufficient supplies. The city's monthly supply volume has been reduced by 1.13 million jin. (Kang Weizhong)

    哈尔滨整顿粮食供应每月节约一百十三万斤
    本报讯　哈尔滨市已结束粮食统销整顿工作。从整顿情况看，过去一般供应量偏高。在集体伙食单位和居民中，供应量偏高的占全市总户数的46.16％，不足户仅占5％，其余户够吃够用。有些饮食业的职工，吃供应营业用的粮食；郊区的非农业户的供应标准也过高，少数农业社用粮食搞副业（如作豆腐）、用口粮喂家畜等。
    在这次粮食统销整顿工作中，对于供应标准偏高的户进行了核减，对于少数不足的作了必要的调剂和安排。全市每月减少供应量一百十三万斤。　（康伟中）
