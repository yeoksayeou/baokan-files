    Over 100 Rightist Backbone Elements Exposed
    Initial Success Achieved in the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers' Purging of Poison and Filth
    (Our dispatch) Since the Democratic Party of Chinese Peasants and Workers (DPCW) launched its anti-Rightist struggle on July 3rd, exposing the Rightist leadership group of Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu, and established a leadership structure with Ji Fang as its core, incomplete statistics show that, up to now, organizations from the central to local levels have successively exposed 117 Rightist backbone elements.
    After the Communist Party's rectification movement began, this group and its agents in various regions became euphoric and carried out large-scale illegal activities.
    First, after plotting at the central level, Rightist elements Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, Li Boqiu, Wang Yifan (member of the DPCW Central Executive Bureau, head of the secretariat, deputy director of the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and member of the National Committee of the CPPCC), Yang Yitang (member of the DPCW Central Executive Bureau, deputy director of the General Office of the Ministry of Communications, and deputy to the National People's Congress), Li Jiansheng (alternate member of the DPCW Central Committee, deputy chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee, and deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau), Wang Jiyi (member of the DPCW Central Committee, deputy director of the Shipyard Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and member of the National Committee of the CPPCC), Zhong Dai (deputy director of the Organization Department of the DPCW Central Committee), and others dispatched Wang Yifan, Yang Yitang, and Zhang Yunchuan to the Northeast, Shandong, Henan, and other regions, respectively, to execute the anti-socialist organizational line and recklessly expand the party. For a period of time, the DPCW implemented the reactionary organizational line of the Zhang, Huang, and Li Rightist group, using any means necessary to recruit and expand, conducting a "major expansion." A batch of historical counter-revolutionaries and elements who had consistently been hostile to the Communist Party and socialism were also absorbed into the party as capital for their struggle with the Communist Party for power.
    In Beijing, Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Jiansheng mobilized their backbone elements, such as Zhang Shenfu (researcher at the Beijing Library), Wang Zhenxin (specialist at the Ministry of Agriculture), Zhang Hanqing (teacher at the University of Foreign Trade), Chen Susheng (editor at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine), Zeng Xianpu (deputy director of the Economic Crops Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and chairman of the DPCW general branch at the Ministry of Agriculture), Li Zongen (president of Peking Union Medical College), and Li Wanchun (head of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1), and invited many elements who were dissatisfied with the Party in the six fields of science and education, engineering technology, agriculture and forestry, medicine and health, culture and art, and women, held more than 20 ignition meetings, and incited anti-Party flames. At the same time, the sparks pre-buried by the Zhang Bojun Rightist group at the Third Plenary Session of the DPCW were also ignited in various regions.
    After the conspiracy activities of the Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu Rightist group were exposed, the cadres of the DPCW Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee immediately took advantage of the victory to launch a struggle against the Rightist elements, and successively exposed two other Rightist branch small groups – the Li Boqiu small group and the Zhang Yunchuan small group – in the first half of July and early August. The members of these two small groups had always been under the instructions of the Rightist elements Li Boqiu and Zhang Yunchuan, dedicating themselves to strategizing, running errands, and cheering for their anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities. After these two Rightist small groups were successively exposed, the ranks of the anti-Rightist struggle in the central and Beijing municipal organs of the DPCW became clearer.
    In local organizations, over the past month, many agents of the Zhang, Huang, and Li Rightist group have also been exposed one after another. In Zhejiang, Rightist elements Li Shihao (chairman of the DPCW Zhejiang Provincial Committee, member of the Central Executive Bureau, director of the Zhejiang Forestry Department, and deputy to the National People's Congress) and Cai Yiming (deputy chairman of the DPCW Zhejiang Provincial Committee and deputy director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Transportation), in addition to igniting fires everywhere in Hangzhou during the rectification movement, also sent cadres to Huzhou and Jiaxing to hold symposiums to incite anti-Party sentiment. In Shaanxi, Rightist element Han Zhao'e (member of the DPCW Central Committee, chairman of the Xi'an Municipal Preparatory Committee, vice governor of Shaanxi Province, and deputy to the National People's Congress) incited intellectuals to publish reactionary remarks. In Jiangsu, Rightist element Deng Haoming (chairman of the DPCW Jiangsu Provincial Committee and director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Transportation) echoed Zhang Bojun from north to south as soon as the rectification movement began, developing anti-Communist elements to expand his "Deng Family Store" and inciting opposition between the medical and health circles and the government. In Shanghai, Rightist element Xia Gaoyang (member of the DPCW Shanghai Municipal Committee and director of the Propaganda Department) incited the Shanghai painting circles to oppose the government as early as August of last year, and during the rectification, he received "personal instructions" from Li Boqiu and repeatedly ignited fires and spread poison everywhere. In Tianjin, Rightist elements Yang Jishi (deputy chairman of the DPCW Tianjin Municipal Committee and deputy director of the Tianjin First Central Hospital) and Wu Menghui (deputy director of the Organization Department of the DPCW Tianjin Municipal Committee) carried out reactionary activities under the personal instructions of Zhang, Huang, Li, and Zhong Dai. In Wuhan, Rightist element Ouyang Ping (deputy director of the DPCW Wuhan Municipal Committee and deputy director of the Wuhan Yangtze River Navigation Administration) took advantage of the opportunity of "blooming and contending" to send people to middle and primary schools to ignite fires and incite opposition to the government in cultural and educational circles.
    In Fujian, Rightist elements Li Shuzhong (chairman of the DPCW Fujian Provincial Committee, vice chairman of the Provincial CPPCC), and Huang Zhen (deputy chairman of the DPCW Fujian Provincial Committee, professor at Fujian Agricultural College), in Changsha, Rightist element Xu Junhu (member of the DPCW Changsha Municipal Committee and director of the Organization Department), in Guangdong, Rightist element Yun Yinglin (deputy chairman of the DPCW Guangdong Provincial Committee and deputy director of the Provincial Supervision Department), and in Guangxi, Rightist element Huang Xianfan (member of the DPCW Guangxi Provincial Committee, professor at Guangxi Normal College, and deputy to the National People's Congress), took the opportunity of the rectification to conspire to incite intellectuals, capitalists, and others to rise up and overthrow the government, creating a Hungarian incident. Rightist elements Li Shuzhong and Huang Zhen firmly stated that they wanted to overthrow the people's regime when arranging for ignition at the grassroots level. Li Shuzhong said, "If we don't succeed this time, I will flee to Hong Kong." Huang Zhen also said, "The Communist Party can go up the mountains, so can't we?"
    In Anhui, Rightist elements Li Xiangruo (chairman of the DPCW Hefei Municipal Committee), Jin Baimiao (person in charge of the DPCW Bengbu Municipal Preparatory Committee), and Wu Jiandong (member of the DPCW Hefei Municipal Committee and head of the Secretariat) repeatedly echoed Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks. In Sichuan, Rightist elements Guo Zhongheng (deputy chairman of the DPCW Sichuan Provincial Committee, chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee, and deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal Labor Bureau), Zhang Mingfan (head of the Secretariat of the DPCW Sichuan Provincial Committee and member of the Chengdu Municipal Committee), and Jiang Xuan (director of the Propaganda Department of the DPCW Sichuan Provincial Committee) formed another Rightist small group under the instigation of Zhang Bojun, frequently peddling Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks and attacking progressive elements and Communist Party members within the DPCW.

    揭发出右派骨干分子一百多个
    农工民主党除毒去污初见成效
    本报讯  农工民主党的反右派斗争自7月3日揭发了章伯钧黄琪翔李伯球右派领导集团，建立了以季方等为核心的领导机构以后，据不完全统计，到目前为止，从中央到地方组织已先后揭发出右派骨干分子一百一十七人。
    共产党的整风运动开始后，这个集团及其各地代理人就得意忘形地进行了大规模的非法活动。
    首先，右派分子章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球、王一帆（农工中央执行局委员、秘书处长、交通部公路局副局长、全国政协委员）、杨逸棠（农工中央执行局委员、交通部办公厅副主任、全国人大代表）、李健生（农工候补中委、北京市委副主委、北京市公共卫生局副局长）、王寄一（农工中央委员、交通部船厂局副局长、全国政协委员）、钟岱（农工中央组织部副部长）等在中央经过策划以后，便派遣王一帆、杨逸棠、张云川分别到东北、山东、河南等地，执行反社会主义的组织路线，滥肆发展。农工民主党在一个时期以来执行了章、黄、李右派集团的反动的组织路线，不择手段，招兵买马，进行
  “大发展”。一批历史反革命分子、一贯敌视共产党和社会主义的分子也被吸收进党内，作为他们同共产党争天下的资本。
    在北京，章伯钧、黄琪翔和李健生动员了他们的骨干分子，如张申府（北京图书馆研究员）、王枕心（农业部专员）、张含清（对外贸易学院教员）、陈苏生（中医研究院编审）、曾宪朴（农业部经济作物总局副局长、农工党农业部总支部主委）、李宗恩（协和医学院院长）、李万春（北京市京剧一团团长）等，在科学教育、工程技术、农林水利、医药卫生、文化艺术和妇女六个方面，邀集了很多对党不满的分子，举行了二十多次点火会，煽动反党的毒焰。与此同时，章伯钧右派集团在农工党三中全会时预埋下的火种，也在各地燃烧起来了。
    章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球右派集团的阴谋活动被揭发后，农工民主党中央和北京市委的干部即乘胜向右派分子展开斗争，并先后于7月上半月和8月上旬揭发了另外的两个右派分支小集团——李伯球小集团和张云川小集团。这两个小集团的分子一向都是在右派分子李伯球、张云川的指使之下，为他们的反党反社会主义的阴谋活动献策奔忙，摇旗呐喊的。这两个右派小集团被先后揭发后，农工民主党中央和北京市委机关反右派斗争的队伍的阵线更分明了一些。
    在地方组织中，一个多月来，章、黄、李右派集团的很多代理人，也陆续被揭发了。浙江的右派分子李士豪（农工浙江省委主委、中央执行局委员、浙江林业厅厅长、全国人大代表）、蔡一鸣（农工浙江省委副主委、浙江省交通厅副厅长），在整风运动期间，除了在杭州到处点火外，还派干部到湖州、嘉兴去召开座谈会，煽动反党。陕西的右派分子韩兆鹗（农工中央委员、西安市筹委主委、陕西省副省长、全国人大代表），煽动知识分子发表反动言论。江苏的右派分子邓昊明（农工江苏省委主委、江苏省交通厅厅长），在整风运动一开始便同章伯钧南北呼应，发展反共分子来扩大他的“邓家店”，并挑拨医药卫生界同政府对立。上海的右派分子夏高阳（农工上海市委委员、宣传处长），早在去年8月间即煽动上海国画界同政府对立，整风中又由李伯球“面授机宜”，接二连三地到处点火放毒。天津的右派分子杨济时（农工天津市委副主委、天津第一中心医院副院长）、吴孟晖（农工天津市委组织处副处长）在章、黄、李和钟岱的亲自指使下，进行反动活动。武汉的右派分子欧阳平（农工武汉市委副主任、武汉长江航管局副局长），乘“大鸣大放”的机会，四出派人到中、小学校点火，煽动文教界反对政府。
    福建的右派分子李述中（农工福建省委主委、省政协副主席）、黄震（农工福建省委副主委、福建农学院教授），长沙的右派分子徐君虎（农工长沙市委委员、组织处长），广东的右派分子云应霖（农工广东省委副主委、省监察厅副厅长），广西的右派分子黄现璠（农工广西省委委员、广西师范学院教授、全国人大代表）等，竟乘整风的机会，阴谋煽动知识分子、资本家等起来推翻政府，制造匈牙利事件。右派分子李述中、黄震在布置基层点火时，曾坚决表示要推翻人民政权。李述中说：“这次如果搞不成，我就逃到香港去”。黄震也说：“共产党会上山，我们就不会上山吗？”
    安徽的右派分子李湘若（农工合肥市委主委）、金白描（农工蚌埠市筹委负责人）、吴建东（农工合肥市委委员、秘书处长）曾同章伯钧的反动言论一再唱和。四川的右派分子郭仲衡（农工四川省委副主委、重庆市委主委、重庆市劳动局副局长）、张明泛（农工四川省委秘书处长、成都市委委员）、姜煊（农工四川省委宣传处长）等，在章伯钧的怂恿下结成了另一个右派小集团，经常贩卖章伯钧的反动言论，打击进步分子和农工民主党内的共产党员。
