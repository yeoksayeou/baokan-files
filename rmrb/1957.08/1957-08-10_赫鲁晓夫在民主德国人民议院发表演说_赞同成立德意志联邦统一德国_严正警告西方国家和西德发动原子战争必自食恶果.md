Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 9th: Soviet Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Khrushchev delivered a speech at the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic on August 8th. When discussing the issue of German reunification, Khrushchev supported the proposal put forward by the government of the German Democratic Republic regarding the establishment of a German Federation. He also warned against the policy of Western countries and West Germany preparing for atomic war.

After pointing out the great achievements made by the German Democratic Republic since its founding, Khrushchev said: The issue of restoring German unity has been the object of sharp political struggle and heated debate for several years, because the basis on which and the method by which this issue is resolved determines not only the future of the German people but also, to a significant extent, the future of Europe and the prospects for peace and security of all countries.

He said: The essence of the issue lies in what kind of unified Germany should be established as a result of reunification, and along what path it will move forward.

Khrushchev pointed out: The German working class and all German working people, all people who cherish the national interests of the German people and cherish peace and security in Europe, justly believe that a reunified Germany should become a peace-loving, democratic country.

However, the masters of the imperialist monopoly organizations, militarists, and revanchists, who have never considered the interests of the German working people and have brought them endless disasters and poverty, want to place the entire Germany under the rule of imperialist monopoly organizations and make Germany return to the old road of war and aggression.

The imperialist forces of Western countries are the encouragers of German militarists. They hope that a unified Germany can become a handy weapon to realize their aggressive conspiracies. In order to realize their dream of dominating the world, they once again want to use the German people as cannon fodder, hoping to use Germans to fight.

These are the two lines and two policies regarding the issue of German reunification and the future of Germany.

Khrushchev pointed out: Historically, there seem to be two traditions in the development of Germany. These two traditions have been fighting in the past and are still fighting now. The first tradition is the tradition of the great German humanists and democrats, who advocated the democratic unity of the motherland and the humanitarian ideas of peace and friendship among the people of all countries. The policy of the German Democratic Republic embodies this progressive tradition. The other tradition is the tradition of the Prussian Junkers, imperialist monopoly enterprises, and bank owners, who have sacrificed national interests for their own selfish class interests more than once. These reactionary traditions are currently manifested in the policies of the ruling groups in West Germany.

Khrushchev said: The policy of militarization and preparation for atomic war pursued by the ruling groups in West Germany and their Western partners has placed the people of European countries, especially the German people, in an extremely dangerous situation.

He said: In this century of unprecedented development of war technology and weapons of mass destruction, once a war breaks out, it will turn densely populated and prosperous areas into deserts. Those West Germans who advocate preparing for a new war must especially remember this.

He pointed out: Once the imperialists start a new war, then in this area where the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc border the socialist camp countries, terrible weapons of destruction such as atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs will be the first to explode here.

He said: The Germans in West Germany should finally understand this and not allow the situation to develop in this direction. The German people should prevent disaster, and they can prevent disaster as long as they do not allow a small group of militarists and monopoly capitalists to manipulate their fate.

The leaders of countries such as Britain and France, whose borders would be threatened by atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons once a war breaks out, should also consider this. American leaders should also consider this, because in this era of vigorous development of rocket technology, no matter how far the distance, it is difficult to guarantee that a country will not be attacked by atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

Khrushchev continued: Under the current circumstances, unifying Germany is not an easy task. The same German nation is divided into two German states with different socio-political systems, and their domestic and foreign policies run counter to each other. This fact cannot be escaped. Whoever truly wants to unify Germany cannot but take this situation into consideration. Obviously, under such circumstances, attempting to unify Germany through some kind of formal, externally induced legal act would only be a dangerous fantasy.

He pointed out: The era of deciding the fate of the people regardless of their will is long gone. The Germans are the masters of their own country and should solve the issue of reunifying Germany themselves. The responsibility of the four major powers is to do everything possible to assist the German people in solving their national problems themselves on a peaceful and democratic basis, through direct negotiations between the two Germanies.

He said: It cannot be denied that this is a difficult road. It will take a lot of effort and time to overcome all obstacles and various differences between the two Germanies. But it is very clear that the method of negotiation between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany will be effective. Although this road is difficult, it is the only practical road.

Khrushchev said: The government of the German Democratic Republic, taking into account the national interests of the entire German people and following this view, has announced its willingness to negotiate more than once, and has also put forward very concrete and practical ways to peacefully restore unity in the current complex situation. This path is to establish a German Federation, that is, to unite two autonomous countries through treaties and adopt a common policy on a certain range of domestic and foreign affairs issues. The German Democratic Republic government's famous statement of July 27th is a program of practical action that conforms to the vital national interests of the German people.

Khrushchev declared his agreement with and support for this proposal. He said: This proposal shows that the German Democratic Republic advocates peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and strives to resolve disputes peacefully. However, the ruling group of West Germany and its Prime Minister Adenauer are standing on a different position. Adenauer firmly implements the "position of strength" policy, and he is the main embodiment of this policy.

Khrushchev pointed out: The recent declaration of the "Principles of Common Policy on German Unification" issued by the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany shows that the Western countries are still taking a stand that deepens the division of Germany and continues to implement a policy of expanding armaments. He said: The Western countries have once again stated that a pan-German government can only be established through so-called free elections throughout Germany. However, it should be known that this is clearly a deceptive statement. Since the Communist Party has been banned in West Germany, progressive organizations and peace advocates of the working people are being expelled and persecuted by the police, and war criminals and Hitler elements are becoming increasingly rampant in political life, how can there be any talk of free elections? The policy in Bonn wants nothing less than to mechanically merge the German Democratic Republic into West Germany, turning democratic Germany into a territory of the large capitalists and Junkers of the Rhine and Ruhr. Western countries openly oppose "the neutralization or demilitarization of Germany." According to their intentions, a unified Germany should join the Atlantic aggressive bloc, and the occupying forces should remain on German territory.

Khrushchev pointed out: The Soviet Union has suggested to Western countries more than once to start consultations on gradually withdrawing troops from Germany. In addition, the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that if the United States and other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization withdraw their troops from West Germany, France, Britain, and other countries, the Soviet Union is not only prepared to withdraw all its troops from the German Democratic Republic, but also from Poland, Hungary, and Romania. Let the people of every country build their lives according to their wishes without foreign troops stationed on their territory. The Soviet Union will not hesitate to take such measures. But the United States does not want this. It needs American troops stationed in Europe so that it can not only control West Germany, but also control other countries in Western Europe.

Khrushchev continued: The governments of West Germany and the three Western countries have once again resorted to their old tricks on the issue of restoring German unity to shelve the issue of restoring German unity and the issue of universal disarmament.

Khrushchev finally said that the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are both members of the Warsaw Treaty, which was signed to prevent the formation of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization from causing serious consequences to the cause of peace in Europe. You can believe that when necessary, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries will definitely fulfill their responsibilities to the German Democratic Republic and help defend its democratic achievements, its freedom, and independence.

### 赫鲁晓夫在民主德国人民议院发表演说  赞同成立德意志联邦统一德国  严正警告西方国家和西德发动原子战争必自食恶果

    赫鲁晓夫在民主德国人民议院发表演说
    赞同成立德意志联邦统一德国
    严正警告西方国家和西德发动原子战争必自食恶果
    据新华社柏林9日电　苏联共产党中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫8月8日在德意志民主共和国人民议院发表演说。赫鲁晓夫在谈到德国统一问题时支持德意志民主共和国政府所提出的关于成立德意志联邦的建议。他还对西方国家和西德准备原子战争的政策提出警告。
    赫鲁晓夫在指出了德意志民主共和国建国以来所取得的伟大成就以后说：恢复德国统一的问题几年来一直是尖锐政治斗争和热烈争论的对象，因为在怎样的基础上和用什么办法来解决这个问题，这不仅决定德国人民的未来，而且在不小的程度上决定欧洲的未来，决定各国的和平和安全的前途。
    他说：问题的实质在于，恢复统一的结果应该建立怎样的一个统一的德国，它将沿着什么样的道路向前发展。
    赫鲁晓夫指出：德国工人阶级和全体德国劳动人民，珍视德国人民民族利益、珍视欧洲和平和安全的一切人们都公正地认为，统一后的德国应当成为爱好和平的、民主的国家。
    而从来不考虑德国劳动人民利益的、并且给他们带来无穷灾难和贫困的帝国主义垄断组织的主子、军国主义者和复仇主义者却想把整个德国置于帝国主义垄断组织的统治下，使德国重新走上战争和侵略的老路。
    西方国家的帝国主义势力是德国军国主义者的鼓舞者。他们希望统一后的德国能成为实现他们侵略阴谋的得心应手的武器。他们为了实现统治世界的梦想，再次要使德国人民充当炮灰，指望用德国人来作战。
    这就是关于德国重新统一和德国前途问题的两条路线和两种政策。
    赫鲁晓夫指出：德国的发展在历史上看来有两种传统。这两种传统在过去和现在一直在进行斗争。第一种传统是伟大德国人道主义者和民主主义者的传统，他们主张祖国的民主统一、主张各国人民和平和友好的人道主义思想。德意志民主共和国的政策体现了这种进步的传统。另一种传统是普鲁士容克贵族、帝国主义垄断企业和银行主的传统，他们不止一次地为了自己自私的阶级利益而牺牲民族利益。这些反动传统目前在西德统治集团的政策中表现出来。
    赫鲁晓夫说：西德统治集团和他们的西方伙伴执行的军国主义化和准备原子战争的政策使欧洲各国人民，首先是德国人民陷入极端危险的境地。
    他说：在我们这个战争技术和大规模毁灭性武器空前发达的世纪里，一旦发生战争就会使人烟稠密的繁华地区变成荒漠。关于这点，那些主张准备新战争的西德人士必须特别记住。
    他指出：帝国主义者一旦搞起新战争来，那末就在这个北大西洋公约组织侵略集团成员国和社会主义阵营国家交界的地方，原子弹和氢弹这样一些可怕的毁灭性武器就会首先在这里爆炸。
    他说：西德的德国人应当终于理解这点，并且不允许局势朝这个方向发展。德国人民应当防止灾祸，而且只要他们不让一小撮军国主义者和垄断资本家来摆布自己的命运，他们就能够防止灾祸。
    英国、法国等这样一些一旦发生战争国境就会遭到原子武器和氢武器威胁的国家的领导人，也应当考虑到这一点。美国领导人也应该考虑这一点，因为在这个火箭技术大力发展的时代里，不管多远的距离也难保一个国家不受原子武器和氢武器的袭击。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说：在目前的情况下统一德国不是件容易的事。同一德国民族却分成两个社会政治制度不同的德意志国家，它们的内外政策背道而驰。这个事实是无法逃避的。谁真正想统一德国就不能不考虑到这种情形。显然，在这种情况下企图依靠某种形式上的、用外力促成的法律行为来统一德国只会是一种危险的幻想。
    他指出：不顾人民的意志来决定他们命运的时代早就过去了。德国人是他们自己国家的主人，应该由他们自己解决重新统一德国的问题。四大国的责任是尽一切力量协助德国人民在和平民主的基础上，用两个德国直接谈判的方法自己来解决他们的民族问题。
    他说：不能否认，这是一条艰难的道路。要克服一切障碍和两个德国间的各种分歧需要不少的努力和时间。但是十分显然，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间谈判的方法是会收效的。这条道路虽然困难，然而是唯一切实可行的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫说：德意志民主共和国政府考虑到全德国人民的民族利益，并遵循着这种观点而不止一次地宣布愿意进行谈判，而且也提出了在目前的复杂情况下切实可行的和平恢复统一的十分具体的道路。这条道路就是成立德意志联邦，也就是通过条约把两个自主的国家联合起来而对一定范围内的内政外交问题采取共同的政策。德意志民主共和国政府7月27日的有名的声明是符合德国人民切身的民族利益的实际行动的纲领。
    赫鲁晓夫声明同意和支持这项建议。他说：这项建议说明，德意志民主共和国主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，并争取用和平方式解决争执问题。而西德统治集团和它的总理阿登纳却是站在另外一种立场上。阿登纳坚决执行“实力地位”政策，他是这种政策的主要体现者。
    赫鲁晓夫指出：美国、英国、法国和西德四国政府最近发表的“关于德国统一的共同政策的原则”宣言表明，西方国家不过仍旧采取加深德国分裂和继续执行扩充军备的政策的立场。他说：西方国家再次声明，只有在整个德国进行所谓自由选举才能建立全德政府。但是，要知道这显然是骗人的话。在西德既然共产党遭到取缔，劳动人民的进步组织和和平人士受到警察的驱逐和迫害，战犯和希特勒分子在政治生活中日益猖獗，那还谈得上什么自由选举呢？波恩的政策里不折不扣地恰恰想把德意志民主共和国机械地归并到西德，把民主德国变成莱因和鲁尔的大资本家和容克贵族的领地。西方国家公开地反对“德国中立化或非军国主义化”。根据他们的意图，统一后的德国应当加入大西洋侵略集团，占领军应当留在德国的领土上。
    赫鲁晓夫指出：苏联不止一次地建议西方国家开始协商逐步从德国撤出军队。此外，苏联还屡次表示，如果美国和北大西洋公约组织的其他国家从西德、法国、英国和其他国家撤出自己的军队的话，苏联不仅准备从德意志民主共和国，而且还准备从波兰、匈牙利和罗马尼亚撤出自己的全部军队。让每一个国家的人民都在没有外国军队驻扎自己的领土的情况下按照自己的愿望建设自己的生活。苏联将毫不犹豫地采取这种措施。但是美国不希望这样。它需要美国军队驻在欧洲，以便不仅可以控制西德，并且还可以控制西欧的其他国家。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说：西德和三个西方国家的政府在恢复德国统一的问题上重新使出它们的老手腕，来使恢复德国统一的问题和普遍裁军问题搁置起来。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏联和德意志民主共和国都是华沙条约的成员国，这个条约是为了防止侵略性的北大西洋公约集团的组成对欧洲和平事业产生严重后果而签订的。你们可以相信，在必要的时候，苏联和其他社会主义国家一定会执行他们对德意志民主共和国的职责，帮助保卫它的民主成果、它的自由和独立。
