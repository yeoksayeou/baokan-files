　　“Party Members Without Dogmatism”
    Xing Huan
    Rightists have one thing in common: they hate the Party, hate the people, and hate socialism. To hate the Party is to inevitably attack Party members. Therefore, many Party members who adhere to Party principles and wholeheartedly serve the people are viciously slandered and vilified by rightists. However, there are also some Party members who not only escape such abuse, but are even regarded as "soulmates" by rightists. Rightists Chu Anping and Lou Bangyan once praised Xu Ying and Peng Zigang as the only "Communist Party members without dogmatism" they knew.
    Dogmatism is something the Communist Party has always opposed. Isn't it a good thing that this couple has no dogmatism? However, the "dogmatism" in the mouths of rightists is completely different from what we generally understand as dogmatism. The "Communist Party members without dogmatism" mentioned by rightists are only "good" for rightists, and completely bad for the Party and the people. Taking Xu Ying and Peng Zigang as an example, they have one attitude towards rightist Chu Anping, and another attitude towards the Party and the people. These two different attitudes fully demonstrate which side they are on.
    Xu Ying was originally the Deputy Director of the State Council's Bureau of Religious Affairs and is now studying at the Central Advanced Party School of the Chinese Communist Party. From March to June of this year, Xu Ying spent nine Sundays out of eleven "plotting in secret" with Chu Anping, conspiring to tamper with the political direction of the Guangming Daily and launch an attack on the Party. After Chu Anping was countered by the people, Xu Ying tried to inquire about news for him, exonerate him, and directly instructed him to make false self-criticisms in an attempt to muddle through. Xu Ying, a Communist Party member, is so concerned about rightists, but he is exceptionally hateful towards Party members, Party cadres, especially veteran cadres, scolding them as "crude and uncultured" and "corrupt and degenerate." He repeatedly attacked the Central Advanced Party School, saying that the Party School was "dogmatic," "not solving problems," "had a very bad school spirit," and "the teaching and research section was misleading people," and that "non-Party scholars should be invited to participate in the work of the teaching and research section."
    Xu Ying's wife, Peng Zigang, is the editor-in-chief of "The Traveler" magazine. In order to turn "The Traveler" into a stronghold for attacking the Party and socialism, Peng Zigang used various excuses to exclude and attack Communist Party members. Over the past two years, she has squeezed out two-thirds of the Communist Party members working in "The Traveler," and those who remain are constantly subjected to her cold looks. When Chu Anping was countered by the people, Peng Zigang, who treated Party members with "cold eyes," was very enthusiastic in joining Lou Bangyan, Fei Xiaotong, and others to find "legal grounds" for Chu Anping, preparing to defend him.
    From the attitude and behavior of Xu Ying and Peng Zigang, it can be completely seen which side they are on. It is not difficult to understand what the "no dogmatism" mentioned by rightists means, and what kind of people the "Communist Party members without dogmatism" are. It seems that the "dogmatism" in the eyes of rightists is Marxism-Leninism. The so-called "no dogmatism" means no Marxism-Leninism and no Party spirit; the so-called "Communist Party members without dogmatism" are actually anti-Party and anti-socialist "Communist Party members." Isn't that so? Although these people are nominally Party members, they attack the Party, scold the Party, oppose the Party, and even want to "overthrow" the Party. Although these people have sworn "to struggle to the end for the cause of communism," they believe that socialism "suppresses" people's enthusiasm, that socialism is "pitch black," and that "the dictatorship of the proletariat has brought about bureaucracy." These people say they are "opposing dogmatism," but in reality, they are opposing the study of Marxism-Leninism. These people, under the banner of "Party members," are doing the dirty work of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism. The issue is very clear. These "Communist Party members without dogmatism" praised by rightists are actually rightists within the Party. They have not a trace of the aura of a Communist Party member. They are merely the spokespersons of bourgeois rightists within the Party!

　　“没有教条主义的党员”
    星环
    右派分子有一个共同点：仇视党、仇视人民、仇视社会主义。仇视党，就必然要攻击党员。因此，许多坚持党的原则、忠心耿耿为人民服务的党员都被右派分子恶毒地诬蔑谩骂。但是，也有些党员不唯不挨骂，而且还被右派分子引为“知己”。右派分子储安平、楼邦彦就曾夸奖过徐盈、彭子冈夫妇是他们所认识的仅有的“没有教条主义的共产党员”。
    教条主义是共产党历来反对的东西，这对夫妇没有教条主义，这不是很好吗？但是，右派分子嘴里的“教条主义”，和我们一般理解的教条主义完全是两回事。右派分子所说的“没有教条主义的共产党员”，只是对右派分子“很好”，对党和人民就完全很不好了。即以徐盈、彭子冈夫妇而论，他们对右派分子储安平是一种态度，对党和人民又是另一种态度，两种不同的态度，充分地表明他们站在什么立场上。
    徐盈原来任国务院宗教事务管理局副局长，现在中共中央高级党校学习。从今年3月到6月的十一个星期日中，徐盈就用了九个星期日的时间，同储安平“策划于密室”，密谋篡改光明日报的政治方向，发动对党的进攻。当储安平遭到人民的反击以后，徐盈又设法为他探听消息，开脱罪责，并且直接指点他作假检讨，企图蒙混过关。徐盈这个共产党员对右派分子这样关切，对党员、党的干部，特别是老干部却异常憎恨，辱骂老干部是“粗暴不文”“腐化堕落”。对中共中央高级党校一再攻击，说党校是“教条主义”、“不解决问题”、“校风很坏”、“教研室是误人子弟”，“应当请非党学者来参加教研室工作”。
    徐盈的妻子彭子冈是“旅行家”杂志的主编。为了把“旅行家”变成向党向社会主义进攻的一个据点，彭子冈以种种借口排斥、打击共产党员，两年来把在“旅行家”工作的共产党员排挤了三分之二，剩下的也时时遭到她的冷眼。当着储安平受到人民的反击以后，这位以“冷眼”对待党员的彭子冈却非常热心地和楼邦彦、费孝通等一起，为储安平寻找“法律根据”，准备为储安平辩护。
    从徐盈、彭子冈这种态度和行为，完全可以看出他们究竟是站在什么立场上，也就不难理解右派分子所说的“没有教条主义”是什么意思，而“没有教条主义的共产党员”又是一些什么样的人。看来，右派分子眼中的“教条主义”，就是马列主义。所谓“没有教条主义”就是没有马列主义、没有党性；所谓“没有教条主义的共产党员”也就是反党反社会主义的“共产党员”。不是吗，这些人虽然名义上是党员，但是却攻击党、谩骂党、反对党，甚至要革党的“命”。这些人虽然宣过誓“要为共产主义的事业奋斗到底”，但是却认为社会主义“压抑”了人的积极性，社会主义是“一团漆黑”，“无产阶级专政带来了官僚主义”。这些人口里说“反对教条主义”，实际上却是反对学习马列主义。这些人打着“党员”的旗号，干的却是反党、反人民、反社会主义的勾当。问题很清楚了，这些被右派分子所称道的“没有教条主义的共产党员”，实际上就是党内的右派，他没有丝毫共产党员的气味，他只是资产阶级右派分子在党内的代言人！
