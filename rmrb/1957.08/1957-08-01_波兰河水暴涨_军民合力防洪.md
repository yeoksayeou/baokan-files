    Warsaw Dispatch: Due to continuous rainfall in Poland, river water levels have risen sharply. Homes in some areas have been flooded, and residents are being temporarily evacuated. Experts estimate that the water flow in various rivers in the past ten days is equivalent to six months' worth under normal conditions. The water level of the Warta River in the west has risen to a level not seen in twenty years. The flood situation is particularly severe in the Łódź province. The Łódź flood control committee has issued a warning and declared a state of emergency in rural areas. The Polish military has been deployed in some areas to cooperate with residents in the flood control effort.
