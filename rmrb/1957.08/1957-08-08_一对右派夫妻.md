In Shanghai, there is a couple named Han Ming and Mo Yun. Last fall, when the right-wing clique of the China Democratic League (CDL) rampantly attacked the Party, they suddenly came forward, actively engaged in social activities, and made a big splash.

The husband, who was eloquent, appeared among groups of unemployed intellectuals one moment, went to joint state-private enterprises the next, and then burrowed into the film and music circles, spreading rumors and inciting trouble everywhere. The wife, who excelled in social interaction, changed clothes and dressed flirtatiously every day, appearing among some famous actors, singers, and painters, flattering, luring, and dragging people into the CDL. This couple jointly attended a dinner party held by a right-wing clique to welcome Luo Longji; participated in the founding ceremony of the CDL branch of the Shanghai Film Studio; and personally followed Chen Renbing to conspire with right-wing elements in the chorus to commit arson. They left their footprints in Shanghai's intellectual, literary, art, and industrial and commercial circles.

Speaking of this couple, their background is not simple. As early as the "December 9th" Movement, Han Ming was a "thug" who disrupted the student movement and later became a reporter for the Kuomintang's Central News Agency. His wife, Mo Yun, was known as the "school flower" when she studied in the Department of Sociology at the Kuomintang's Central University, and she developed a set of outstanding social skills. Ten years ago, when they were still in their twenties, they had a deep friendship with Luo Longji. Luo Longji personally introduced Han Ming to the CDL and was also the marriage witness for the two of them.

After liberation, Han Ming colluded with foreign businessmen in speculative business, using the guise of doing business to conceal his political face and anti-Party activities. After being punished by the government in the "Five-Anti" movement, he transformed himself into an "unemployed intellectual."

This couple lived in a noble apartment in Shanghai and had been secretly engaged in unspeakable activities. Chen Renbing, Zhao Wenbi, Peng Wenyin, Sun Siming, and Lu Yi, the right-wing leaders of the Shanghai CDL, were all frequent visitors to their home. Whenever Luo Longji came to Shanghai, Han Ming was always the first to know and enthusiastically drafted the "reception schedule." The couple spent money and effort, several times gathering the core members of the Shanghai CDL right-wing clique at his home for dinner parties and gatherings; conspiring to usurp the leadership of the Shanghai CDL, and offering suggestions for Sun Dayu's plot to attack the Party.

Last year, in order to actively expand their "strength," the Shanghai CDL right-wing clique had this "talented" couple come out and publicly engage in activities. Han Ming jumped from an "ordinary member" to become the deputy director of the Liaison Committee of the CDL Municipal Committee, and then infiltrated the Counselor's Office of the Municipal People's Committee. Mo Yun was particularly appreciated by Chen Renbing, the Shanghai commander of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and transformed from a "housewife" into a full-time cadre of the CDL Municipal Committee. Chen Renbing sent her to specifically contact his target for arson—Shanghai's various literary and art groups.

Han Ming and Mo Yun showed their skills in right-wing anti-Party activities. Han Ming spread anti-Soviet remarks everywhere, and he also frequently listened to the "Voice of America," fabricating and spreading many reactionary news and stories. Han Ming tried his best to attack the left wing of the CDL. When Shi Liang sharply refuted Luo Longji's anti-Party remarks, he slandered Shi Liang as being motivated by personal hatred. Last year, when Premier Zhou made a report on the issue of intellectuals, Han Ming took the opportunity to slander, saying, "Intellectuals have just risen from slaves to guests," "a few people have reached the eighteenth floor, while most are still in the eighteenth level of hell." Han Ming used methods such as inviting people to dinner, playing tennis, and even introducing girlfriends to win over many unemployed intellectuals, and personally held two forums to ask them to complain and provoke dissatisfaction with the government. When Han Ming was studying at the amateur political university organized by the Municipal CPPCC, he discovered that the film actress Wu Yin was extremely dissatisfied with the Party, so he immediately targeted her and gathered right-wing elements such as Peng Wenyin and Sun Siming to form a so-called "mutual aid group," creating a large number of fallacies and instigating Wu Yin to fire at the Party. He once said, "A Hungarian incident may also happen in China." Once, when Wu Yin talked about the contradiction between productive forces and production relations that many actors had no roles to play after liberation, Han Ming immediately clapped his hands and applauded, more viciously adding, "People are different from antiques. The older antiques are, the higher their value, but people are better the younger they are." Later, he arranged for a person to impersonate an "audience member" and sent Wu Yin fourteen letters in a row, encouraging her anti-Party emotions and providing her with "materials" to attack the Party. Han Ming also encouraged Wu Yin's godson Jiang Zhong to make trouble in the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, "encouraging" him to play the role of "steel cannon" and "vanguard" and create "arson" experience. Han Ming was even more "active" in sabotaging the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Under his instigation, the private manager of Wang's Agricultural Machinery Factory actually proposed to withdraw from the joint state-private ownership and confront the state-owned professional company. At the Shanghai Municipal CPPCC meeting held in May this year, Han Ming personally drafted a joint speech with a group of right-wing elements, scolding activists as "bridgeheads" and "moats."

Liaison and winning over people was Mo Yun's specialty. Not long after she took office, she personally arranged five forums for Chen Renbing at "Shanghai Film Studio" to commit arson. When the painters of the preparatory committee of the Chinese Painting Academy were causing disunity, she repeatedly visited a famous painter, flattering him and inducing him to vent his dissatisfaction with another painter, attempting to collect these materials to sabotage the establishment of the Chinese Painting Academy. Mo Yun faithfully implemented the large-scale development policy planned by the right-wing of the CDL, not only assisting Chen Renbing in establishing a CDL branch in the Shanghai Chorus, but also bypassing the grassroots CDL organizations in the literary and art circles, making single-line contact with many well-known figures, alienating them from the Party, arranging meetings with Chen Renbing, and trying their best to bring them into the CDL. In just a few months, the couple developed nearly twenty new members for the CDL.

After the vigorous anti-rightist struggle unfolded, the right-wing faces of this couple were exposed. Han Ming and Mo Yun, who were once high-spirited, suffered a shameful defeat along with their masters, the Zhang-Luo alliance.

    一对右派夫妻
    新华社记者　叶世涛　续磊
    上海有这样一对夫妻，男的叫韩鸣，女的叫莫筠。去年秋天，当民盟右派集团猖狂向党进攻的时候，他们突然冒出头来，在社会上大肆活动，大出风头。
    能说会道的丈夫，一会儿出现在失业知识分子群中；一会儿来到公私合营厂；一会儿又钻进电影、音乐界，到处搬弄是非、造谣煽动。擅长交际的太太，每天更衣换装，打扮得妖妖娆娆，出没在一些著名演员、歌唱家和画家的中间，吹捧拉拢、拖人入盟。这对夫妻曾共赴右派小集团欢迎罗隆基的聚餐会；参加过上海电影制片厂民盟支部的成立典礼；又亲随陈仁炳同合唱团右派分子密谋放火。在上海知识界文艺界和工商界，都留下了他们的足迹。
    说起这对夫妻，来历可不简单。韩鸣早在“一二·九”运动的时候，就是破坏学生运动的“打手”，后来又当过国民党中央社的记者。他的太太莫筠在国民党中央大学社会系读书时，曾有“校花”之称，练就了一套出色的交际手腕。十年以前，当他们还是二十来岁的青年，就同罗隆基有了深情厚谊。罗隆基亲手介绍韩鸣加入民盟，又是他俩结婚的证婚人。
    解放后，韩鸣勾结外国商人做投机生意，用经商的招牌掩饰他的政治面貌和反党活动。“五反”运动中受到政府的惩处后，他又摇身一变而为“失业知识分子”。
    这对夫妇住在上海一所高贵的公寓里，一直暗中进行着不可告人的活动。上海民盟右派头子陈仁炳、赵文璧、彭文应、孙斯鸣、陆诒都是他家的常客，每当罗隆基到上海来，韩鸣总是最先知道并热心地拟定“招待日程”。夫妇二人出钱卖力，几度为罗隆基召集上海民盟右派集团的骨干在他家里聚餐集会；密谋篡夺上海民盟的领导权，并为孙大雨进攻党的阴谋献策。
    去年，上海民盟右派集团为了积极扩充“实力”，这对有“才干”的夫妇便抛头露面出来公开活动了。韩鸣从一个“普通盟员”一跃成为民盟市委联络委员会的副主任，继而又打进了市人民委员会参事室。莫筠特别为章罗联盟上海的主将陈仁炳所赏识，从“家庭妇女”一变而为民盟市委的专职干部，陈仁炳派她专门联系自己看中的放火目标——上海各文艺团体。
    韩鸣、莫筠在右派反党活动中大显身手。韩鸣到处散布反苏言论，他还经常收听“美国之音”，编造传布许多反动新闻和故事。韩鸣极力打击民盟的左派，当史良尖锐地驳斥罗隆基反党言行时，他污蔑史良是出于私恨。去年周总理作了有关知识分子问题的报告，韩鸣又趁机诽谤说：“知识分子刚刚从奴隶升为客人”，“少数人弄到十八层楼，多数还在十八层地狱中。”韩鸣用请客吃饭，打网球，以至介绍女朋友等方式，笼络了许多失业知识分子，并亲自召开了两次座谈会，要他们诉苦，挑起对政府的不满。韩鸣在市政协举办的业余政治大学学习时，发现电影演员吴茵对党极为不满，就马上盯上了她，并且纠集了彭文应、孙斯鸣等右派分子，成立了所谓“互助组”，制造大量谬论，唆使吴茵向党开炮。他曾说：“中国也可能发生匈牙利事件。”有一次吴茵谈到解放后许多演员没有戏演是生产力和生产关系的矛盾，韩鸣马上拍手叫好，更恶毒地接上去说：“人不同于古玩，古玩愈老价值愈高，人是愈年轻愈好。”后来他又布置一个人假冒“观众”，连续寄给了吴茵十四封信，激励她的反党情绪，供给她向党进攻的“材料”。韩鸣又鼓动吴茵的干儿子蒋忠在上海管弦乐团闹事，“勉励”他要起“钢炮”和“先锋”作用，创造“放火”经验。对破坏私营工商业社会主义改造，韩鸣更加“积极”。在他的煽动下，汪氏农业机械厂的私方经理竟然提出要退出公私合营，同国营专业公司对抗。在今年5月召开的上海市政协会议上，韩鸣又亲手起草同一批右派分子的联名发言，谩骂积极分子为“桥头堡”、“护城河”。
    连络拉拢是莫筠的特长。她上任不久就亲手为陈仁炳布置了“上影”的五次座谈会，进行放火。当国画院筹备委员会的画家在闹不团结的时候，她屡次访问一个名画家，极力对他恭维奉承，诱导他发泄对另一名画家的不满意见，企图收集这些材料来破坏国画院的建立。莫筠忠实地执行着民盟右派谋划的大发展方针，不但襄助陈仁炳在上海合唱团建立了民盟支部，还撇开文艺界的民盟基层组织，单线联系许多知名人士，挑拨他们同党疏远，布置和陈仁炳会见，竭力拉他们入盟。在短短的几个月中，夫妻二人为民盟发展了将近二十名新成员。
    轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争开展以后，这对夫妇的右派面目被揭穿了。一度神气活现的韩鸣和莫筠，同他们主子章罗联盟一起遭到了可耻的失败。
