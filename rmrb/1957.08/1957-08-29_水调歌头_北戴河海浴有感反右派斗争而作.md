Water Melody

Inspired by Swimming in Beidaihe, Written in Response to the Anti-Rightist Struggle

Li Jishen

Shedding my cares by the vast sea, I gaze far into the primordial chaos,
Plunging myself into the great socialist torrent.
The boundless expanse, encompassing all streams,
Finally sees the rivers Jiang, Huai, He, and Han, rushing together to pay homage to the source. "Note 1"
Fear not the overturning of violent waves, surely it will absorb hundreds of rivers flowing east.
Burning the rhinoceros horn to illuminate, the demons appear in discord, "Note 2" I am wary of myself.
Eliminate the remnants of capitalist poison, not leaving a trace.
Cleansing must be further cleansed, the movement intensified,
Breaking through the waves, wrestling with dragons.
A glance sweeps away the haze, a long whistle stirs the heavens with vigor.

Note 1: Mu Hua's "Sea Ode": Vast and turbid, waves surge forth with momentum.
Note 2: Mu Hua's "Sea Ode": Demons clash in discord, obscure and deviant.

　　水调歌头
　  北戴河海浴有感反右派斗争而作
　　李济深李济深解袂临沧海，举目极鸿蒙，纵身投入社会主义巨流中。浩瀚泓涵万派，终见江淮河汉，腾赴共朝宗。“注一”那怕狂澜倒，定吸百川东。燃犀照，群妖迕，“注二”惕吾躬。清除资本遗毒，点滴不留容。洗涤还须洗涤，运动加深运动，破浪搏蛟龙。指顾阴霾扫，长啸激天风。
    注一：木华海赋：泱漭澹泞，腾波赴势。
    注二：木华海赋：群妖遘迕，眇?冶夷。
