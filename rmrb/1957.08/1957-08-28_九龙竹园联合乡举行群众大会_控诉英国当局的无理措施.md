Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 27th. Residents of Kowloon Chuk Yuen United Village held a mass meeting yesterday, accusing the Hong Kong British authorities of insisting on demolishing a large area of Chuk Yuen United Village, and of failing to provide appropriate resettlement and reasonable compensation to the villagers being demolished, resulting in the unreasonable measure of destroying homes and bankrupting villagers.

A farmer, victimized in the second batch of demolitions, accused at the meeting: The seedlings alone on all his cultivated land were worth several hundred Hong Kong dollars (HKD), but after the Hong Kong authorities leveled his cultivated land and tore down his houses, they only compensated him with a little over 400 dollars. This money is not only insufficient for him to switch to another occupation to maintain his livelihood, but it is also not enough for relocation.

A villager accused that after his land was confiscated by the Hong Kong British authorities, the Hong Kong British authorities only compensated him with 70 to 80 cents per square foot of land. However, in some areas near the Thirteen Villages adjacent to Chuk Yuen Village, which are far less prosperous than Chuk Yuen Village in Kowloon, the market price of land is at least five dollars per square foot, and some even reach thirty to forty dollars. He accused the Hong Kong authorities of being extremely unfair in their compensation for land prices.

The villager's mass meeting finally decided to elect twenty representatives to petition the British Governor of Hong Kong, Grantham, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities first provide reasonable compensation and resettlement to the villagers who have been demolished and are about to be demolished. The resolution also expressed support for the Kowloon Thirteen Villages United Support for Chuk Yuen Villagers Association's support for Chuk Yuen Village.

It is reported that the Hong Kong British authorities will continue to demolish Chuk Yuen United Village recently. Some villagers have already received notices that their houses and cultivated land will be demolished on September 5, 13, and 20 respectively.

　  九龙竹园联合乡举行群众大会
　　控诉英国当局的无理措施
    新华社香港27日电　九龙竹园联合乡居民昨天举行群众大会，控诉香港英国当局坚持清拆竹园联合乡广大地区，并且对被清拆乡民不作适当安置和合理赔偿，使乡民遭受毁家破产的无理措施。
    一个在第二批清拆中受害的农民在会上控诉说：他所有的耕地就是青苗费也值几百元（港币，下同），但是，香港当局将他的耕地铲平、房屋拉倒后，只补偿四百多元，这些钱不但不能使他转业再维持生活，就是用于搬迁也不够。
    一个乡民控诉说，他的田地被香港英国当局没收后，香港英国当局对每呎地的地价补偿只给七、八角，而目前在九龙远没有竹园乡繁荣的十三乡邻近一些地区，地价市价每呎起码五元，有些更达三、四十元。他指责说，香港当局对地价的补偿是极不公平的。
    这个乡民群众大会最后决定选出代表二十人，向香港的英国总督葛量洪请愿，要求香港英国当局对已被清拆和将要被清拆的乡民先作合理赔偿和安置。决议并表示拥护九龙十三乡联合支援竹园村民会对竹园乡的支持。
    据悉，香港英国当局最近还要继续清拆竹园联合乡，一些乡民已经接到通知，他们的房屋和耕地，要分别在9月5日、13日和20日被清拆。
