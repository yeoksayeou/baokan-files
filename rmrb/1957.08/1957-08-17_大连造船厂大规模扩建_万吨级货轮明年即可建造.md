Dalian Shipyard to Undergo Large-Scale Expansion
    10,000-ton Freighters to be Built Next Year

    (Our newspaper, Dalian, 16th) Dalian Shipyard has begun a large-scale expansion. The expansion project is designed according to the construction of large freighters with 13,000 horsepower and a displacement of 22,000 tons. After the expansion is completed, the shipyard's annual ship production capacity will reach 100,000 tons of displacement.

    The Dalian Shipyard was originally a dilapidated factory with a history of 58 years. After liberation, with the help of the Soviet Union, the factory underwent tremendous restoration and transformation, and production developed rapidly. From 1947 to now, the factory has built more than 870 ships of various sizes, totaling sixteen or seventeen types. Initially, the factory could only build 100-ton flat-bottomed boats and 150-horsepower tugboats, and later gradually developed to be able to build 1,200-horsepower tugboats and 3,700-ton oil barges. It is currently building China's first 4,500-ton deadweight large oil tanker. Another 5,000-ton deadweight coastal freighter is also being actively prepared for construction.

    In order to strive to start building 10,000-ton freighters in May next year, the expansion project of Dalian Shipyard has started in August. The scale of the expansion project is very large. The new slipway will be 228 feet long (including the slipway part), and will be more than twice as large as the existing slipway in terms of area, height, and load capacity. The new welding and assembly workshop is also very large, and the factory building will be as high as a seven-story building.

    In the design process of the factory's expansion project, due to the implementation of the spirit of building the country with diligence and thrift, and making full use of existing equipment, the investment was reduced by 26 million yuan compared with the original design.

    大连造船厂大规模扩建
    万吨级货轮明年即可建造
    本报大连16日电  大连造船厂开始大规模扩建。扩建工程是按照建造一万三千匹马力、排水量二万二千吨的大型货轮设计的。扩建完工后，这个厂年产船舶的排水量可达十万吨。
    大连造船厂原是一个已有五十八年历史的、破乱不堪的工厂。解放后，这个厂在苏联的帮助下进行了巨大的恢复和改造，生产迅速发展。从1947年到现在，这个工厂已建造了八百七十多艘大小轮船，共十六、七种类型。最初，这个厂只能建造一百吨的平底船和一百五十匹马力的拖轮，以后逐年发展到能造一千二百匹马力的拖轮和三千七百吨的油驳轮。现在正在建造我国第一艘载重量四千五百吨的大油轮。另一艘载重量五千吨的近海货轮也在积极准备建造。
    为了争取明年5月开始建造万吨级的货轮，大连造船厂的扩建工程已在8月份动工。扩建工程的规模很大。新建的造船台将达二百二十八尺长（包括下水滑道部分），不论面积、高、负荷量，都将比现有造船台大一倍多。新建的焊接装配车间也很庞大，厂房将有七层大楼那么高。
    这个厂的扩建工程在设计过程中，由于贯彻了勤俭建国的精神，尽量利用了现有设备，因此比原设计削减了二千六百万元的投资。
