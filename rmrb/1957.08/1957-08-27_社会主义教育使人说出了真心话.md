Socialist Education Makes People Speak From the Heart

The Liulin Agricultural Cooperative in Langshan Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, which frequently cried out about "grain shortage," after undergoing socialist propaganda and education, its members voluntarily revealed: during this year's autumn harvest distribution, 50% of the households still had last year's stored grain, and 90% of the households had not finished eating the wheat distributed in the spring. This incident educated the cooperative cadres who had right-leaning tendencies on the grain issue. They plan to sell 40% of the increased 70,000 jin of rice to the state after fulfilling the unified purchase quota. Now that the early rice has just been harvested, the cooperative has already sold more than 20,000 jin of rice.

Like other agricultural cooperatives in Jiangjin County, the Liulin Agricultural Cooperative retained an average of 500 jin of grain per person after last year's autumn harvest (not including income from private plots), of which 300 jin was unhusked rice. However, in the month before this year's autumn harvest, many members cried out that they did not have enough grain to eat. Qiu Yuxiang, secretary of the Liulin Cooperative branch of the Communist Party of China, and other cooperative cadres had the same amount of grain as the members and were not short of grain. They estimated that the members would not be short either, but seeing that many people were crying out about the grain shortage, they began to waver. They supplied grain to some of the members who cried out the loudest and asked the higher authorities to reduce this year's grain sales quota.

Recently, in the socialist education movement carried out in the Liulin Agricultural Cooperative in conjunction with the autumn harvest distribution, the cadres explained in detail the significance of selling surplus grain to support the country's industrial construction and organized the members to discuss the benefits of unified purchase and sales. Everyone pointed out that the Liulin Agricultural Cooperative was established after the unified purchase and sales of grain. Thanks to collectivization and the support of national industry, production has increased year after year. The amount of grain retained by members after fulfilling the unified purchase quota has also increased. In the previous year, each person retained 408 jin of grain, and last year it was 500 jin. In addition, with the price of industrial products decreasing, the lives of farmers have improved rapidly after selling surplus grain. In the past three years, the 33 members of the Fourth Production Team alone have newly purchased 22 pairs of rubber shoes, 5 pairs of leather shoes, 9 thermos bottles, and 16 flashlights. In the discussion, the members unanimously agreed that all of this would not be possible without the implementation of unified purchase and sales. Therefore, many members voluntarily examined their mistakes in creating a grain shortage. To the cadres' surprise, out of the 221 households in the village, more than 110 households said that they still had last year's stored unhusked rice. The Zhang Kunxiang family of eight, who had the most stored grain, had 1,000 jin of stored unhusked rice. It was common to have 100 to 200 jin of stored grain. About 200 households in the village still had wheat distributed in the spring, with some having 400 jin and others having 30 jin. They all agreed to sell more surplus grain this year.

Zhang Wanyin, a member of the Sixth Production Team, was originally one of the most vocal about the grain shortage. He even sent his mother to his younger brother's house to eat, and he stopped cooking for a day to coax the cadres to supply him with 30 jin of unhusked rice. This time, he examined his mistakes, actively supported the plan to sell more surplus grain, and even guided the cadres to his house to see the wooden barrel where he stored grain. There were 120 jin of last year's stored grain, 60 jin of wheat distributed this spring, and a lot of corn.

The 58-year-old member, Qiu Er Ye, expressed the feelings of many members in his speech at the discussion. He said: "We were afraid of starvation in the old society. Although we joined the cooperative, we always wanted to store as much grain as possible at home. This is not right. Only by selling more surplus grain to support the country and build up industry can farmers live a prosperous life forever."

　　社会主义教育使人说出了真心话
    新华社记者　喻权域　刘宗棠
    经常叫喊“缺粮”的四川江津县琅山乡柳林农业社，经过社会主义宣传教育，社员们自动谈出：今年秋收分配时，50％的人家还有去年的陈粮，90％的人家没有吃完春天分到的小麦。这件事教育了在粮食问题上有右倾情绪的社干部，他们计划在完成统购任务以后，再从增产的七万斤水稻中卖出40％给国家。现在早稻刚收完，社里已卖出稻谷两万多斤。
    柳林农业社和江津县其他农业社一样，去年秋收后每人平均留粮五百斤（不包括自留地收入），其中有三百斤是黄谷。今年秋收前的一个月中，却有很多社员叫喊粮食不够吃。中共柳林社分支部书记丘玉祥等社干部分的粮食和社员一样，并不缺粮，估计社员也不会缺，但是看见叫喊缺粮的人多了，也开始动摇。他们给一些叫喊最厉害的社员供应了粮食，并要求上级削减今年的售粮任务。
    最近在柳林农业社结合秋收分配开展的社会主义教育运动中，干部们详细讲解了出卖余粮支援国家工业建设的意义，组织社员讨论统购统销带来的好处。大家指出，柳林农业社是在粮食统购统销以后才建立的，由于合作化和国家工业的支援，年年增产。完成统购任务以后社员留的粮食也有增加，前年每人留粮四百零八斤，去年即留五百斤。加以工业品价格降低，农民卖出余粮后生活改善很快。近三年来，仅第四生产队三十三户社员就新置了胶鞋二十二双、皮鞋五双、暖水瓶九个、电筒十六只。社员们在讨论中一致认为，不实行统购统销这一切都办不到，因此很多社员都自动检查了闹缺粮的错误。出乎干部意料，全村二百二十一户中，有一百一十多户人家都说家里还存有去年的陈黄谷。存粮最多的张坤祥一家八口，有陈黄谷一千斤。存谷一、二百斤的很普遍。全村约有二百户人家还存有春天分的小麦，多的有四百斤，少的也有三十斤。他们都同意今年多卖余粮。
    第六生产队社员张万银，原是闹缺粮最厉害的一个。他甚至把母亲送到弟弟家去吃饭，自己断了一天炊，哄骗干部供应给他三十斤黄谷。这次他检查了错误，积极支持多卖余粮的计划，还引导干部到他家楼上去看他存粮的木桶，那里有一百二十斤去年的陈谷，六十斤今春分的小麦，还有很多玉米。
    五十八岁的社员丘二爷在座谈会上的发言说出了很多社员的心里话。他说：“我们在旧社会饿饭饿怕了，虽然入了社，总想尽量多存些粮食在家里。这样不对。只有多卖余粮支援国家把工业化建设好了，农民才能永世过丰衣足食的日子。”
