This newspaper reported from Shenyang on the 21st: The Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, Shenyang Survey and Design Institute, Northeast Industrial Building Design Institute, and five other design units, adhering to the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift, saved the nation 213 million yuan in construction funds during the first seven months of this year. This was achieved through thorough investigation and research, repeated comparison, and calculation. This sum could be used to build fourteen medium-sized coal mines with an annual output of 450,000 tons. In addition, they also saved more than 2,400 tons of steel and cement, and 646 cubic meters of wood. These savings were the result of the continuous improvement of socialist consciousness and technical level of the design personnel under the leadership of the Party. In their designs, they tried every means to use domestically produced equipment as much as possible, saving more than 6 million yuan in foreign exchange on this item alone. When designing a certain project, the Liaoning Provincial Urban Design Institute, after comparing several options and repeated calculations, saved ten boilers, reducing investment by 70,000 yuan.

These design units sent more than 500 technical backbones to major cities across the country to conduct on-the-spot investigations and research. Based on the principle of doing more with less money, they realistically proposed engineering projects that could be reduced, postponed, or constructed in phases. The projects that have now been approved by the state for reduction or postponement can save an investment of more than 110 million yuan.

    沈阳八个设计单位
　　节约建设资金两亿元
    本报沈阳21日电　沈阳煤矿设计院、沈阳勘测设计院、东北工业建筑设计院等八个设计单位，遵循勤俭建国的方针，在今年七个月中经过切实调查研究，反复比较、计算后，为国家节约建设资金两亿一千三百多万元，用这笔资金可以建设年产四十五万吨的中型煤矿十四个。另外，还节约了钢材、水泥二千四百多吨，木材六百四十六立米。这些节约成就，是设计人员在党的领导下，社会主义觉悟和技术水平不断提高的结果。他们在设计中想尽一切办法尽量采用国内自制设备，仅这一项就节约外汇六百多万元。辽宁省城市设计院在设计某项工程时，经过若干方案的比较和反复计算，结果节省了十台锅炉，节约投资七万元。
    这些设计单位曾派出了技术骨干五百多人到全国各大城市作实地调查研究工作，以少花钱多办事为原则，实事求是地提出可以削减、缓办和可以分期建设的工程项目。现在已由国家批准的可以削减、缓建等项目，就可节约投资一亿一千多万元。
