American Diplomacy Runs Into Walls Everywhere
Gu Si

In the past two weeks, American foreign policy has run into walls in the disarmament conference, in the Middle East, and in China.

Soviet Intercontinental Missile Shatters American Atomic Blackmail

The Soviet Union announced on August 26 that it had developed an intercontinental missile and successfully conducted the world's first intercontinental ballistic rocket launch test. This is a major event that will have a profound impact on the future international situation.

This great scientific and technological achievement of the Soviet Union greatly strengthens the power to defend world peace. Now the Soviet Union has conquered the limitations of geographical distance and can strike back at aggressors in any corner of the world in an instant. In the past few years, after losing its monopoly on atomic and hydrogen bombs, the United States relied on the geographical advantage of being separated by two oceans as a capital to continue pursuing a "position of strength" policy and preparing and inciting war. Now, this capital is also exhausted.

However, the Soviet Union has no intention of using its intercontinental missiles to threaten other countries. It solemnly declared that it was only because Western countries adopted a clear negative attitude on the issue of disarmament that the Soviet Union had to take necessary measures to ensure its own security; the Soviet Union will continue to make unremitting efforts to strive for the signing of a disarmament agreement. On August 27, the Soviet Union once again proposed at the meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee that an agreement should be reached immediately on several urgent initial disarmament measures. This clear stance of the Soviet Union profoundly reflects its sincere desire for peace.

The Soviet Union's development of intercontinental missiles is a powerful blow to the United States, which is obstructing disarmament by refusing to ban atomic and nuclear weapons. In the past five months, the Soviet Union has made tremendous efforts at the London Disarmament Conference to reach an agreement, proposing to sign agreements on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, guarantees against the use of atomic weapons, and preliminary reductions in conventional armaments. However, the United States believed that it surpassed the Soviet Union in the storage of atomic and nuclear weapons, so it only advocated stopping the production of atomic and nuclear weapons to ensure its own advantage, while refusing to ban the use of nuclear weapons. Moreover, in order to develop intercontinental missiles before the Soviet Union as capital for a "policy of strength," the United States was unwilling to truly disarm and stop the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons. Therefore, after a long delay, the United States and its "allies" successively put forward two so-called "proposals" on August 2 and 21. One was an attempt to completely bypass the substantive issues related to disarmament and turn the disarmament negotiations into empty talk about the so-called "open skies"; the other was to insist on a series of unsolvable preconditions to block the possibility of a rapid signing of an agreement to stop nuclear weapons testing. At the disarmament subcommittee meeting on August 27, the Soviet representative sternly refuted these Western countries' conspiracy to obstruct the agreement, and pointed out their responsibility for bringing the negotiations to a standstill. This powerful exposure made the Western countries very embarrassed. The completion of the Soviet intercontinental missile proves even more the necessity of a complete ban on the use of atomic and nuclear weapons, providing a very powerful reason for the Soviet proposal and inflicting a heavy blow on the American conspiracy to obstruct disarmament negotiations.

The Soviet Union's efforts in developing science and technology and striving for the conclusion of disarmament agreements will have a significant impact on promoting world peace: 1. Further strengthening the strength of the peace camp and encouraging the confidence of the people of all countries in defending peace; 2.打击了帝国主义战争集团的气焰，并使它们在执行备战政策中产生更多的矛盾; 3. It will prompt more people (especially those adventurers who harbor侥幸心理 and those who are indifferent to peace) to realize the seriousness of modern warfare, and thus seriously consider the issues of disarmament and maintaining peace, thereby promoting the progress of disarmament. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru said, he hopes that the emergence of intercontinental missiles can play a sobering role in disarmament negotiations.

"Eisenhower Doctrine" Has No Way to Deal with Syria

In Syria, the American "Eisenhower Doctrine" of aggression in the Middle East has hit another big nail.

On August 12, the Syrian government issued a statement exposing the American conspiracy to subvert the Syrian government. Subsequently, the Syrian government took some measures to consolidate its internal affairs. This action by the Syrian government to safeguard its national independence thoroughly exposed the true face of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and once again foiled the American conspiracy to seize Syria and isolate Egypt.

The American aggressor group was angered by the exposure of its conspiracy. It instructed the American propaganda machine to clamor, slanderously claiming that the recent Soviet economic assistance to Syria had allowed the Soviet Union to "control" Syria, and portrayed the measures taken by Syria to consolidate its internal affairs and resist American aggression as the Communist Party seizing power. They attempted to portray the situation in Syria as a so-called "international communist threat" to surrounding countries in order to create an excuse for direct American intervention in Syria.

However, even Eisenhower himself, when slandering Syria, could not help but admit that the situation in Syria was entirely an internal affair and that the United States could not apply the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to intervene. Faced with this situation of powerlessness, the United States attempted to use the Baghdad Pact countries around Syria and other pro-Western countries to put pressure on Syria, with Turkey, which has been under American control since the war, as the main force. After tense consultations with Britain, the United States sent the State Department's conspiracy expert, Assistant Secretary of State Henderson, to Turkey to discuss ways to intervene in Syria with the Turkish government and the kings of Iraq and Jordan and representatives of Lebanon who arrived there one after another. Henderson has now arrived in Lebanon and will also visit other Middle Eastern countries to plan and deploy.

Judging from the information that has been revealed, the United States will continue to carry out subversion activities within Syria, while instructing the countries surrounding Syria to surround and isolate Syria, and to coordinate and support the subversion activities within Syria. On the other hand, the United States is also preparing for military intervention. The Turkish army, trained and equipped by the United States, is reportedly concentrated on the Syrian-Turkish border. Since Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Group and the Baghdad Pact, it will receive the support of these two groups. The US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean abandoned its visit to French ports and is conducting so-called "exercises" in the Mediterranean. According to British newspapers, the United States will send an additional fleet of 188 warships to the Mediterranean to join the Sixth Fleet. In late September, the Sixth Fleet and the North Atlantic Group's navy will hold large-scale joint "exercises" in the Mediterranean and will conduct amphibious landings in the Eastern Mediterranean. At the same time, the so-called "Anti-Subversion Activities Committee" of the Baghdad Pact will discuss means of subverting Syria in London.

Obviously, the United States may use a two-pronged approach of subversion and military intervention to invade Syria in order to eliminate this hidden danger that prevents the United States from dominating West Asia. However, this conspiracy of the United States has aroused great anger among the Syrian people and has further strengthened their determination to defend their national independence and oppose American aggression. The Syrian people, after repeated struggles with imperialism, have greatly increased their vigilance and strengthened their unity. American subversion activities will inevitably continue to fail. Some of Syria's pro-Western neighbors may not be able to unreservedly follow the United States against Syria in the event of Syria's resolute resistance to aggression. Because Iraq has oil pipelines passing through Syria, and Jordan's foreign trade and Lebanon's entrepot trade to the Arab world mostly have to pass through Syria. Tense relations with Syria are detrimental to them. As for the American means of showing strength, in today's world where the American policy of strength has been thoroughly bankrupted, it cannot scare Syria. Syria is by no means isolated in the anti-colonialist struggle. It has the support of peace-loving people all over the world. As long as Syria and Egypt are closely united, remain vigilant, and persevere in the struggle, the American conspiracy of aggression will inevitably end in failure.

Dulles, Who Is Hostile to the Chinese People, Is in a Dilemma

The American policy of hostility toward the Chinese people has now hit a wall once again.

After the end of the World Youth Festival in Moscow, a group of American youths, at the invitation of the All-China Youth Federation, have come to China for a visit. The US State Department issued threats and warnings to them in order to prevent them from coming to China, but it was not successful. On the contrary, the US State Department's means of obstructing exchanges between Chinese and American youths have been condemned by American public opinion, and have once again aroused criticism of the American policy toward China and the US State Department's refusal to allow American journalists to come to China.

Under the pressure of public opinion, the US State Department had to change its decision to ban American journalists from visiting China. On August 22, the US State Department issued a statement stating that it would allow twenty-four journalists to visit China for six months on a so-called "experimental basis." The statement specifically pointed out that the reason why the US State Department decided to do so was because "some new factors have emerged" in China, and it is advisable to use these journalists to obtain "further intelligence on the domestic situation in China."

Everyone remembers that in Dulles' speech in San Francisco on June 28, which was hostile to the Chinese people, he slandered socialist China as "a phenomenon that is about to disappear." He also said that the United States has a responsibility to "do everything possible to make this phenomenon disappear"; as long as "trade and cultural relations can promote this disappearance, then we will establish such relations." It can be seen that the US State Department has a pathetic illusion, regarding the recent rampant attacks by bourgeois rightists in China as a "new factor" that can be used to overthrow socialist China. And these twenty-four journalists are the tools that the American government wants to use as tools of American foreign policy, sent to collect intelligence for American subversion conspiracies.

Not only that, the US State Department also specifically stated in the statement that the United States would not give Chinese journalists reciprocal visas. In other words, the United States, regardless of reciprocal international practice, on the one hand, attempts to force China to accept its unilateral decision, and on the other hand, does not allow Chinese journalists to visit the United States. This arrogant and rude attitude is unacceptable to any sovereign country.

As a result, the US State Department has once again put itself in a difficult situation. Its decision to refuse to grant reciprocal visas to Chinese journalists has been widely criticized. "The New York Times" said in an editorial entitled "Let's Not Have Curtains Here": "We think it was wrong for the Secretary of State to delay letting our own reporters into Communist China, and then only to agree to let our own reporters into Communist China. We believe that his refusal to grant 'reciprocal visas' to Chinese holding passports issued by the Chinese Communist regime is still wrong." Democratic Senator Fulbright and Republican Senator Hickenlooper also opposed the State Department's refusal to allow Chinese journalists to visit the United States.

Until the United States changes its unrealistic policy toward China, Dulles will always be trapped in this dilemma from which he cannot extricate himself.

### 美国外交到处碰壁

　　美国外交到处碰壁
　　顾思
    在过去两个星期中，美国外交政策，在裁军会议上、在中东和在中国都碰了壁。
    苏联的洲际导弹粉碎了美国的原子讹诈
    苏联在8月26日宣布它已制成了洲际导弹，并且顺利地进行了世界上第一枚洲际弹道火箭的发射试验。这是对今后国际局势将要产生深远影响的重大事件。
    苏联这一科学技术上的伟大成就，大大加强了保卫世界和平的威力。现在苏联已经征服了地理距离的限制，可以在顷刻之间还击世界上任何角落的侵略者。过去一些年中，美国在丧失了对原子弹、氢弹的垄断之后，曾经依恃两洋阻隔的地理上的有利地位，作为继续奉行“实力地位”政策、准备和煽动战争的一种资本。现在，它的这一点资本也输光了。
    但是，苏联却丝毫也没有拿它的洲际导弹来威胁其他国家的意图。它庄严地声明：只是由于西方国家在裁军问题上采取明显的否定态度，苏联才不得不采取必要的措施以保证自己的安全；苏联今后将继续不懈地进行努力，以争取签订裁军协议。8月27日，苏联就在联合国裁军小组委员会会议上再一次提出建议，要求立即先就刻不容缓的几项初步裁军措施达成协议。苏联这种鲜明的立场，深刻地反映了它的热爱和平的真诚愿望。
    苏联制成洲际导弹，给用拒绝禁止原子武器和核武器来阻挠裁军问题的美国以有力的打击。在过去五个多月中，苏联在伦敦裁军会议上曾经为达成协议作了巨大的努力，建议签订有关停止核武器试验、保证不使用原子武器和初步地裁减常规军备的协定。可是美国却以为自己在原子武器和核武器的储存上超过苏联，所以它只主张停止生产原子武器和核武器，以保证自己的优势，而拒绝禁止使用核武器。而且为了能够先于苏联制成洲际导弹，作为“实力政策”的资本，美国也不愿意真正裁军和停止核武器的制造和试验。因此，在经过长期拖延以后，美国和它的“盟国”在8月2日和21日先后提出了两个所谓“建议”。其中一个是企图完全撇开有关裁军的各项实质问题，把裁军谈判转变为讨论所谓“开放天空”的空谈；另一个是坚持要以一系列的无法解决的先决条件，来堵塞迅速签订停止核武器试验协定的可能。在8月27日的裁军小组会议上，苏联代表严词驳斥了西方国家这些阻挠协议的阴谋，指出了它们使谈判陷于搁浅状态的责任。这种有力的揭露，使西方国家非常狼狈。而苏联洲际导弹的制成，更加证明完全禁止使用原子武器和核武器的必要，为苏联的建议提供了十分有力的理由，而使美国阻挠裁军谈判的阴谋遭到了惨重的打击。
    苏联在发展科学技术和争取达成裁军协议这两个方面的努力，在促进世界和平方面将产生重大的影响：一、进一步加强了和平阵营的力量，鼓舞各国人民捍卫和平的信心；二、打击了帝国主义战争集团的气焰，并使它们在执行备战政策中产生更多的矛盾；三、促使更多的人（特别是那些抱有侥幸心理的冒险者和对和平漠不关心的人）认识到现代战争的严重性，因而认真思考有关裁军和维护和平的问题，从而推动裁军问题的进展。正如印度总理尼赫鲁所说的，希望洲际导弹的出现，对裁军谈判能起清醒头脑的作用。
　  “艾森豪威尔主义”在叙利亚无计可施
    在叙利亚，美国侵略中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”又碰了一个大钉子。
    8月12日，叙利亚政府发表声明，揭露美国颠复叙利亚政府的阴谋。接着，叙利亚政府采取了一些巩固内部的措施。叙利亚政府这个维护本国独立的行动，彻底揭穿了“艾森豪威尔主义”的真面目，使美国夺取叙利亚、孤立埃及的阴谋又一次遭到了失败。
    美国侵略集团由于阴谋败露而恼羞成怒。它指使美国的宣传机器大肆叫嚷，诬蔑苏联最近给叙利亚的经济援助使苏联“控制”了叙利亚，并且把叙利亚为巩固内部、抵抗美国侵略而采取的措施，说成是共产党掌握了政权。它们企图把叙利亚的局势说成是对周围国家的一种所谓“国际共产主义威胁”，以便为美国直接干涉叙利亚制造借口。
    但是，甚至艾森豪威尔自己在诬蔑叙利亚的时候，也不能不承认，叙利亚的局势完全是内政问题，美国不能应用“艾森豪威尔主义”来加以干涉。面对这种无能为力的情势，美国就企图利用叙利亚周围的巴格达集团国家和其他亲西方国家，来对叙利亚施加压力，而以战后一直就在美国控制下的土耳其作为主力。美国在同英国进行了紧张的磋商以后，就派国务院的阴谋专家、副国务卿帮办汉德逊前往土耳其，同土耳其政府以及先后赶到那里的伊拉克、约旦国王和黎巴嫩的代表，会商干涉叙利亚的办法。汉德逊现在已经到了黎巴嫩，并且还将到其他中东国家去访问，进行策划和布置。
    从已经透露的消息看来，美国将继续在叙利亚内部进行颠复活动，同时指使叙利亚周围的国家包围和孤立叙利亚，对叙利亚内部的颠复活动予以策应和支持。另一方面，美国也在进行军事干涉的准备。由美国训练和装备的土耳其军队，据传已经在叙、土边境集中。由于土耳其是北大西洋集团和巴格达集团的成员，因此它将受到这两个集团的支持。美国在地中海的第六舰队放弃了对法国港口的访问，正在地中海上进行所谓“演习”。据英国报纸报道，美国将增派一支由一百八十八艘军舰组成的舰队到地中海去同第六舰队会合。9月下旬，第六舰队和北大西洋集团的海军将在地中海举行大规模联合“演习”，并且将在东地中海进行两栖登陆。而在同时，巴格达集团的所谓“反颠复活动委员会”，将在伦敦讨论颠复叙利亚的手段。
    显然，美国可能用颠复活动和军事干涉双管齐下的手段侵略叙利亚，以除掉这个妨碍美国独霸西亚的心腹之患。但是，美国的这种阴谋，已引起了叙利亚人民极大的愤怒，更加坚定了他们保卫本国独立，反对美国侵略的决心。叙利亚人民经过同帝国主义一次又一次的斗争，已经大大提高了警惕性，并且加强了团结，美国进行颠复活动，势将继续遭到失败。叙利亚的某些亲西方的邻国，在叙利亚坚决抵抗侵略的情况下，也未必能无所顾忌地跟着美国反对叙利亚。因为伊拉克有油管通过叙利亚，约旦的对外贸易以及黎巴嫩向阿拉伯世界的转口贸易，也大部分都要经过叙利亚。同叙利亚关系紧张，对它们本身是不利的。至于美国显示实力的手段，在美国实力政策遭到彻底破产的今天，更不能吓倒叙利亚。叙利亚在反殖民主义斗争中决不是孤立的。它得到全世界爱好和平的人民的支持。只要叙利亚和埃及紧密团结，保持警惕，坚持斗争，美国的侵略阴谋必将以失败而告终。
    敌视中国人民的杜勒斯陷入了窘境
    美国敌视中国人民的政策现在也又一次碰了壁。
    在莫斯科举行的世界青年联欢节结束以后，有一批美国青年应中华全国民主青年联合会的邀请，已到中国来访问。美国国务院为了阻挠他们到中国来，向他们发出了威胁和警告，但是没有成功。相反，美国国务院的这种阻挠中美两国青年交往的手段，遭到了美国舆论的谴责，并且再度引起了对于美国对华政策和美国国务院不许美国记者来华问题的抨击。
    在舆论的压力之下，美国国务院不得不改变它的禁止美国记者访问中国的决定。8月22日，美国国务院发表声明，表示允许二十四名记者在所谓“试验的基础上”到中国来访问六个月。声明里面特别指出，美国国务院之所以决定这样做，是因为中国“出现了一些新的因素”，因而宜于利用这些记者来得到“关于中国国内的现状的进一步情报”。
    大家还记得，杜勒斯6月28日在旧金山发表的敌视中国人民的演说中，曾经诬蔑社会主义的中国“是一种要消逝的”现象。他并且说，美国有责任“尽一切可能使这种现象消逝”；只要“贸易和文化关系能够促进这种消逝，那末我们就建立这样的关系”。由此可见，美国国务院抱有可怜的幻想，把最近中国资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻，看作是一种大可利用来推翻社会主义中国的“新因素”。而这二十四名记者，就是美国政府要把他们作为美国外交政策的工具，被派来替美国的颠复阴谋进行搜集情报的活动的。
    不但如此，美国国务院还在声明中特别说明美国不会给中国的新闻记者以互惠的签证。换句话说，美国不顾互惠的国际惯例，一方面企图强迫中国接受它的片面决定，一方面又不许中国记者访问美国。这种蛮横无礼的态度，是任何主权国家所不能接受的。
    结果，美国国务院又一次使自己落入了窘境，它拒绝给中国记者以互惠签证的决定，遭到了广泛的抨击。“纽约时报”在一篇题为“让我们这里不要有帷幕”的社论里说道：“我们认为国务卿迟迟不让我们自己的记者进入共产党中国，后来又只同意我们自己的记者进入共产党中国是错误的。我们认为他拒绝以‘互惠签证’给予持有中国共产党政权发给的护照的中国人仍然是错误的。”民主党参议员富布赖特和共和党参议员希肯鲁普也反对国务院不许中国记者访问美国的做法。
    在美国改变它的不现实的对华政策以前，杜勒斯将始终陷在这个进退不得的窘境里而不能自拔。
