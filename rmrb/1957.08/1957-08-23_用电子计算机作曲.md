    Composing Music with Electronic Computers

    The news that electronic computers are capable of composing music has recently caused a sensation in the United States.

    According to American scientists, the rules of composition can be translated into a language that electronic computers can understand, and then this language is fed into the electronic computer. As a result, music is produced. The first piece produced in the experiment was a song called "Berserker by Button."

    An American scientist named Hiller said that the tunes produced by this machine may never compete with Mozart's best works, but they can immediately surpass swing music.

    用电子计算机作曲
    电子计算机能够作曲的消息，最近在美国哄传一时。
    据美国科学家说，把作曲的规则译为电子计算机所能了解的文字，然后将这种文字供给电子计算机。结果，就有歌曲出来。在试验中得到的第一首作品是一支叫“按电纽的伯尔赛”的歌曲。
    美国一个名叫李奇的科学家说，这种机器作出来的曲子可能永远不能同莫扎特的最好的作品竞争，但是，它们现在立刻能够胜过摇摆舞音乐。
