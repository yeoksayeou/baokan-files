　　The Communist Party is Our Lifeline
　　Zhang Yinsheng, Student of Tsinghua University

　　“I, who was a beggar in the old society, am now in college. This is something I could never have dreamed of in the past.”

    Taking advantage of the Party's rectification campaign, bourgeois rightists launched a frantic attack on our Party under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work style.

    Rightists know that it is not easy to ignite the fire among workers and farmers, so they started by igniting the fire among intellectuals and young people first.

    The entire activities of Zhang Bojun's key general in the scientific and educational circles—the rightist Qian Weichang—fully demonstrate the frenzy of the rightists. As soon as the rectification began, Qian Weichang said that the atmosphere of being masters of our own house had become weak, and demanded "protection for scientists," saying that the quality of teaching was not as good as before, negating the achievements of teaching reform, negating learning from the Soviet Union, negating the Party's leadership in schools, and advocating learning from Britain and the United States. He spread slander everywhere among young people, saying that "there is no distinction between progress and backwardness," and described the Party's ideological education of young people as feudal constraints, and tried his best to promote the so-called "individuality" and "freedom" of capitalism. He exaggerated the individual shortcomings in the Party's work, even fabricating rumors out of thin air, and slandered the Party. What is his purpose? Obviously, he said that Soviet science and education were backward and not worth learning from, not because he wanted to improve China's scientific and educational undertakings, but because he wanted to negate Soviet science and education, thereby negating teaching reform, negating the Party's leadership in science, and leading China's scientific and educational undertakings away from the socialist road and onto the capitalist road. It is worth noting that under the guise of such a "scientist" and "youth mentor," many young people and even many members of the Communist Youth League fell into his trap. But there is only one truth, and deception is always deception, and deception will not last long. After a large number of facts were revealed, and after analysis and criticism, many young people quickly recognized the true face of the rightists.

    This anti-rightist struggle has given our young people a very profound education in political struggle and tested every Communist Party member and Communist Youth League member. At the beginning of the rightists' attack on us, most of the Communist Youth League members of Tsinghua University were able to stand firm on the proletarian position and resolutely fight back against the rightists, and many people also stood in the middle ground, and a few traitors also appeared. With the progress of the anti-rightist struggle, the middle forces also stood at the forefront of the struggle. It can be seen that the positions of many members of our school's League are not very firm, they have not been tested by political storms, and they have been growing in greenhouses for the past few years, and they will inevitably sway when encountering major storms. At present, most of the members have actively invested in this struggle and are willing to exercise themselves in the struggle. The fierce struggle tells young people that only by following the Communist Party closely and standing firm on the proletarian position will they not stumble in any storm. And I myself have also been newly tested.

    My family's background is that of peasants. Before liberation, we suffered all kinds of hardships, eating tree bark, wearing rags, and living a life of hunger and cold. My childhood from the age of nine to eleven was spent begging for food. I joined the Eighth Route Army at the age of thirteen, as a little devil, and later worked under the education of the Party. After liberation, the Party led the peasants to carry out land reform, overthrowing the landlord class, and the peasants were given land, and recently agricultural cooperation was realized. I, who was a beggar in the old society, am now in college. This is something I could never have dreamed of in the past. Thinking about the past and looking at the present, I can't help but shed tears. I clearly know that this is the result of the leadership of the Communist Party and the struggle of countless martyrs. I have personally experienced that the Communist Party is not only the lifeline of workers and peasants, but also the lifeline of intellectuals. We will never allow these rightists to weaken and shake the regime that our countless martyrs have exchanged for with their heads and blood.

　　共产党是我们的命根子
　　清华大学学生　张银生
　　“旧社会中做过叫化子的我，今天也上了大学，这是过去做梦也想不到的事情”。
    资产阶级右派分子乘党整风之机，打着帮助党整风的招牌，向我党发动了猖狂的进攻。
    右派分子知道，要在工人、农民中点起火来是很不容易的，于是首先从知识分子和青年中开始点火。
    章伯钧在科学界、教育界的一员大将——右派分子钱伟长的全部活动充分说明了右派分子的猖狂性。整风一开始，钱伟长就说当家做主的气味淡薄了，要求“保护科学家”，说教学质量今不如昔，否定教学改革的成绩，否定学习苏联，否定党在学校中的领导作用，主张学习英、美。他在青年中到处散布谰言说，“人无进步与落后的区别”，把党对青年的思想教育说成是封建约束，竭力提倡资本主义的所谓“个性”、“自由”。他利用党的工作中的个别缺点，加以夸大，甚至无中生有的造谣，污蔑党。他的目的是什么呢？很明显，他说苏联科学、教育落后，不值得学习，并不是想把我国科学、教育事业办好，而是想通过否定苏联的科学、教育，进而否定教学改革，否定党对科学的领导，使我国科学、教育事业脱离社会主义道路，走向资本主义道路。值得注意的是在他这种“科学家”、“青年导师”的幌子下，很多青年甚至很多共青团员竟上了他的圈套。但是真理只有一个，欺骗终归是欺骗，欺骗总不会长久的。当大量事实揭发出来后，经过分析批判，不少青年很快认清了右派分子的真面目。
    这次反右派斗争给了我们青年以极深刻的政治斗争教育，考验了每一个共产党员、共青团员。右派分子向我们进攻的开始，清华大学的共青团员们，多数能够站稳无产阶级立场、坚决向右派反击，也有许多人站在中间立场上，也出现了少数叛徒。中间派随着反右派斗争的进展也都站到了斗争的最前列。可以看出我们学校许多团员立场是不十分坚定的，没有经过政治风浪的考验，过去几年一直是在温室中成长的，一遇大的风雨必然要摇摆。目前大部分团员已积极的投入了这场斗争，都愿在斗争中锻炼自己。激烈的斗争告诉青年，只有紧紧的跟着共产党走，站稳无产阶级立场，才不会在任何风浪中栽斤斗。而我自己也得到了新的考验。
    我的家庭是农民成分，解放前受尽了苦难，吃树皮、穿烂衣，过着饥寒交迫的流浪生活。我的九岁到十一岁的童年是在讨饭中度过的，十三岁参加了八路军，当小鬼，后来一直在党的教育下工作着。解放后，党领导农民进行了土地改革，推翻了地主阶级，农民分得了土地，最近又实现了农业合作化。旧社会中做过叫化子的我，今天也上了大学，这是过去做梦也想不到的事情。想想过去，看看现在，我禁不住掉下泪来。我清楚地知道这都是共产党的领导，和无数先烈奋斗的结果。我亲身体验到共产党不仅是工人、农民的命根子，也是知识分子的命根子。我们无数先烈用头颅和鲜血换来的政权，决不允许这些右派分子削弱和动摇。
