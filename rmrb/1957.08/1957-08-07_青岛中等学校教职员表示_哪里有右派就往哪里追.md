Qingdao Secondary School Faculty and Staff Declare:
    We Will Pursue Rightists Wherever They Are

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The faculty and staff of 33 secondary schools in Qingdao are actively fighting back against the Rightists, and the Rightist elements are now completely isolated.

    The secondary schools in the city were an important stronghold for the Rightist clique within the China Democratic League. Among the 39 Rightist elements exposed in various schools, 32 were members of the China Democratic League. During the period of "Great Blooming and Great Contending," these Rightist elements, under the direct planning of the Rightist clique headed by Chen Yangzhi, launched organized and planned attacks against the Party. Rightist element Wang Ziming of the 17th Middle School declared, "We will attack the Party and never withdraw until we achieve complete victory."

    Since the beginning of July, each school has launched face-to-face struggle through reasoned argument against the Rightist elements under the slogan of "Defend the Party, Defend Socialism."

    As the anti-Rightist struggle unfolded, the true faces of the Rightist elements were fully exposed. Many teachers in the schools, after engaging in the struggle, recalled the past and compared it with the present, and have come to a greater realization of the necessity of ideological remolding for intellectuals. Therefore, the faculty and staff all declared that they will pursue and investigate wherever there are Rightist elements.

    青岛中等学校教职员表示
    哪里有右派就往哪里追
    本报讯　青岛市三十三个中等学校的教职员，积极反击右派，现右派分子已完全陷于孤立。
    该市中等学校是民盟右派小集团的重要据点。各校已揭发出的三十九名右派分子中，有三十二名是民盟的成员。这些右派分子在大放大鸣期间，在以陈仰之为首的右派小集团的直接策划下，有组织、有计划地向党进攻。第十七中学右派分子王子明扬言，“向党进攻，不获全胜，决不收兵”。
    7月上旬以来，各校在保卫党、保卫社会主义的口号下，与右派分子展开了面对面的说理斗争。
    随着反右派斗争的展开，右派分子的面目毕露了。许多学校的教师们投入斗争后，回忆过去对比今天，已更加体会到知识分子改造的必要性。因此，教职员们都表示，哪里有右派分子，就往那里追查。
