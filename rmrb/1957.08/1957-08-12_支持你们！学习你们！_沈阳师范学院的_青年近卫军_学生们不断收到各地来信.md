Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th. The "Young Guards" students of Shenyang Normal College have been continuously receiving letters from young people and soldiers across the country in recent days, expressing their support and desire to learn from their heroic actions in resolutely fighting against right-wing elements.

Volunteer soldier Chen Xuelie, stationed far away in Korea, wrote: We will never forgive those right-wing elements who dream of turning back the wheels of history. You have set an example for young people; you truly deserve to be called "Young Guards" soldiers. Li Su from a certain PLA unit wrote in his letter: You are doing the right thing, fighting well, we will always be with you. Please tell the right-wing elements that the muzzles of our People's Liberation Army will always be aimed at the enemy. The Communist Party will not tolerate slander, and the path of socialism will never waver. One passionate letter after another expresses the common will and determination of young people to defend the Communist Party and defend socialism.

This "Young Guards" team is composed of six students from the Chinese Department of Shenyang Normal College: female Communist Youth League members Zhang Hao, Chen Yulin, Zhang Shuxian, Cheng Zhuangbao, male Communist Youth League member Suo Baogang, and youth Tang Linna. It is one of the earliest progressive groups to emerge from the dozens of progressive organizations in the anti-rightist struggle at Shenyang Normal College. On June 12th, when right-wing elements Zhang Baisheng and Huang Zhenlü incited some students with right-leaning sentiments to go to the "Liaoning Daily" to protest the newspaper's publication of articles refuting their fallacies, lecturer Li Chenglie gave a speech to the masses, advising students not to be fooled by the right-wing elements. The next day, the right-wing elements posted a big-character poster, launching a personal attack on Li Chenglie. Right next to this reactionary big-character poster, a big-character poster signed "Young Guards" appeared, supporting lecturer Li Chenglie. Afterwards, when the right-wing elements posted a big-character poster, the "Young Guards" students would also post a big-character poster next to it, refuting the right-wing elements. They waged a tit-for-tat struggle against the right-wing elements, effectively exposing and refuting their fallacies. Now, the "Young Guards" students, along with other graduating students from Shenyang Normal College, are continuing to stay at the school to fight against the right-wing elements.

    支持你们！学习你们！
    沈阳师范学院的“青年近卫军”学生们不断收到各地来信
    新华社沈阳11日电　沈阳师范学院的“青年近卫军”学生们，连日来不断收到各地青年和战士们表示支持和学习他们坚决向右派分子斗争的英勇行为的来信。
    远在朝鲜的志愿军战士陈学烈来信说：那些梦想使历史的车轮向后退的右派分子，我们是绝不会饶恕他的。你们给青年们树立了榜样，你们真不愧为一名“青年近卫军”战士。解放军某部李苏在来信中说：你们作得对，斗争得好，我们永远和你们在一起。请你们转告右派分子们，我们解放军的枪口永远向着敌人，共产党不容污蔑，走社会主义的道路决不会动摇。热情洋溢的信一封又一封，每一封信里都表达了青年们保卫共产党、保卫社会主义的共同意志和决心。
    这支“青年近卫军”是沈阳师范学院中文系的女共青团员张昊、陈玉琳、张淑贤、程庄葆和男共青团员索宝刚，以及青年唐林楠等六名学生组成的，是沈阳师范学院反右派斗争中的几十个进步社团里最早出现的一个。6月12日这天，右派分子张百生、黄振旅煽动一部分有右倾情绪的学生去“辽宁日报社”抗议报纸登载批驳他们谬论的文章时，李承烈讲师向群众讲演，劝告学生们不要上右派分子的当。第二天，右派分子便贴出了大字报，对李承烈进行人身攻击。就在这张反动的大字报旁边，出现了一张署名“青年近卫军”的大字报，支持李承烈讲师。以后，右派分子贴出一张大字报，“青年近卫军”的学生们就在旁边也贴上批驳右派分子的大字报。他们同右派分子针锋相对地进行斗争，有力地揭露和批驳了右派分子的谬论。现在，“青年近卫军”学生们正同沈阳师范学院其他毕业班的同学一起，继续留校同右派分子进行斗争。
