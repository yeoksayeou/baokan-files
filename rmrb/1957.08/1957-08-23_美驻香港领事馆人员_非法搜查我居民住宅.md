Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 22nd: Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" and "New Evening Post" reported on the 21st that on the 20th, staff from the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong broke into and searched the homes of four Chinese family households on the third floor of 321 West Main Street, Shau Kei Wan, Hong Kong, and interrogated the residents.

The newspapers quoted residents of the floor as saying that at noon on the 20th, two people claiming to be from the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong broke into the floor, claiming to be "investigating" the residents living in the arcade building. These two U.S. Consulate personnel questioned them for a long time and even moved things from the rooms to search. Afterwards, they entered the room of a Chinese Canadian relative and took out private letters from the drawers to inspect. Another old overseas Chinese relative and the landlady's old family servant on the floor were also subjected to rude questioning without cause, and were asked to check their "identity cards" for residing in Hong Kong. After harassing them for about 45 minutes, the two U.S. Consulate personnel took two residents of the arcade building to the U.S. Consulate for questioning before leaving.

These residents felt very uneasy about the harassment by U.S. Consulate personnel.

The newspapers reported that incidents of U.S. Consulate personnel illegally searching residents' homes in Hong Kong have been repeatedly exposed by the victims. In May of this year, U.S. Consulate personnel broke into 5 Liuli Street, Causeway Bay, and illegally searched the home of Hong Kong businessman Wu Shuzhi. Afterwards, the Hong Kong British police authorities also confirmed that they had received a report of this incident. In January of last year, U.S. Consulate personnel forcibly entered South China Middle School to question and search a female student named Lin Kangyi. Afterwards, the female student's parents also protested to the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong against this violation of human rights.

    美驻香港领事馆人员
　　非法搜查我居民住宅
    据新华社香港22日电　香港“文汇报”、“新晚报”21日报道：香港筲箕湾西大街三百二十一号三楼的四家华胞眷属住户，20日被美国驻香港领事馆人员闯入搜查盘问。
    报纸引据这层楼的住客说，20日午间，两个自称是美国驻香港领事馆的人员闯入这层楼说是“调查”住在骑楼房的住户。这两个美国领事馆人员向她们盘问了许久，还把房里的东西搬下来搜查。随后又进入一位加拿大华侨眷属住的房里，动手把抽屉里的私人信件拿出来检查。这层楼里的另一位老侨眷和包租人的老家姑也都无故受到粗暴的盘问，并要检查她们居住香港的“身份证”。这两个美国领事馆人员在骚扰了三刻钟左右以后，临走还把骑楼房的两个住客带去美国领事馆询问。
    这几户居民对美国领事馆人员的骚扰感到非常不安。
    报纸报道说，美国领事馆人员在香港非法搜查居民住宅的事件，曾被事主屡次揭发。今年5月间，美国领事馆人员曾经闯入铜锣湾琉璃街五号，非法搜查香港商人伍述之的住宅，事后香港英国警察当局也证实接获这一事件的报告。去年1月，美国领事馆人员还强入南华中学盘问和搜查一个名叫林康怡的女学生，事后这个女学生的家长对这种侵犯人权的行为也曾向美国驻香港领事馆提出抗议。
