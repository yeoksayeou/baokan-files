    The Shanghai workers, with their excellent revolutionary tradition, could no longer tolerate the frenzied attacks launched by the bourgeois right-wing elements against the people, in their vain attempt to subvert our people's democratic dictatorship and overthrow the leadership of the Party. On May 20th, they held a symposium, severely refuting the reactionary fallacies of the right-wing elements and exposing their sinister plot to drag today's society back to the old capitalist road. This was a resounding warning. However, a certain writer got angry. He immediately wrote an article entitled "Not Right," submitted to the Liberation Daily (but not published), scolding the workers' admirable action as "not right!" and as "covering up internal contradictions." He said that only by talking about shortcomings could one "get closer to the facts." He said that the workers' "views were outdated," and that the workers should let the right-wingers clamor and attack, and not be allowed to resist or fight back.
    This person who willingly acted as a pawn for the right-wing elements is the writer Wang Ruowang, who is draped in the cloak of a Communist Party member.
    When the likes of Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and Zhang Naiqi put forward the idea of abolishing the leadership of the Communist Party, and began to be countered by advanced people in the capital, Wang Ruowang became even more furious. He wrote a poem entitled "Observing the Wind and Predicting the Rain" for the People's Daily (but not published). He called the anti-communist remarks the sound of "orioles," the force of rebuffing the rightists the "osmanthus-breaking axe" and "wax spearhead," Marxism-Leninism the "tightening spell," and the rightists the "flower-scattering fairies."
    During the blooming and contending period, Wang Ruowang fired countless poisonous arrows, ranging from the Party's literary and artistic undertakings to various major political issues.
    In his article "Setting Up Defenses Step by Step" (see Wenhui Daily, April 26), he scolded the Party's literary and artistic undertakings as "one voice alone" and "one flower blooming alone." He opposed adhering to the socialist mainstream, opposed the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and opposed fighting poisonous weeds. He advocated that the Party's literary and artistic undertakings should not set up "defenses" and should have no taboos. He called all the Party's literary and artistic principles "defenses," even the most basic one of not violating the constitution was a "defense," a rigid rule. In his article "Digging Out the Old Roots of Sectarianism" (see Literary Monthly, June issue), he more concentratedly opposed the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, attacked worker-peasant-soldier writers, slandered Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as a "talisman," and vilified writers who insisted on publicizing the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers as "crooked-mouthed monks." Last April, Wang Ruowang told nearly a thousand young writers that when writing, they should not first study policy, because things written after studying policy are guaranteed to be dry, formulaic, and conceptualized. Then he openly directed the spearhead of attack at Chairman Mao, saying: "In Chairman Mao's report on the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, he divided the peasants into upper-middle peasants and lower-middle peasants, and proposed that upper-middle peasants who did not want to join the cooperative could stay outside. If you write according to Chairman Mao's words, then you are wrong. Because, the opposite is true, now everyone in the countryside wants to join the cooperative, and the upper-middle peasants are even more active than the lower-middle peasants, almost desperately." This spring, at a short story symposium held by the Shanghai Writers Association, he repeated this opinion, saying: "The reason why writers are not writing well now is because before you write, you have to consider the educational role for the masses. Once you consider this, what you write will naturally be formulaic and conceptualized." These opinions, without analysis, show his reactionary advocacy.
    Wang Ruowang not only said many slanderous things about literary and artistic work, but also put forward his absurd propositions on many major political issues. He spared no effort in opposing the socialist transformation of capitalism and attacked the measures of sending public representatives to joint public-private enterprises. In his article "Separated by a Board" (see Shanghai News Daily, May 7), like Zhang Naiqi's argument, he said that bourgeois elements no longer have two sides to them, and that their mood is "trying their best to contribute to socialist construction, but feel unable to get involved." He accused the public representatives of creating estrangement and slandered the public representatives as "two-faced people" whose "content and form, principles and strategies are inconsistent." Wang Ruowang questioned us: The public representatives have "two sides," "how can we expect to transform the two sides of the bourgeois elements?"
    In many of Wang Ruowang's articles, he talked about the issue of political classification of people. He opposed dividing progress and backwardness politically and opposed conducting class analysis of people. In his article "Explanation of 'Backward Elements'" (see Wenhui Daily, May 20), he said: This practice of dividing the masses into activists and backward elements is one of the roots of "sectarianism." He also falsely accused the titles of backward elements, etc., as being "added by the Party and the personnel department." Even in his article scolding the rightist Xu Zhongnian for insulting Communist Party members ("Smelly with Potholes"—Refuting Xu Zhongnian, see Wenhui Daily, June 21), he still helped the rightists by admitting that Communist Party members and ordinary intellectuals, even the likes of Xu Zhongnian, also had "smelly potholes," but only to a slightly different extent. In the articles "Separated by a Board" and "Not Right," Wang Ruowang obliterated the essential difference between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and even promoted the reactionary argument that the bourgeoisie is more advanced than the working class.
    Anti-Party and anti-socialist thoughts have permeated Wang Ruowang's soul. He associates everything he sees. When he saw the news that agricultural cooperatives were raising livestock separately, he immediately wrote "Raising Cattle, Taking on Apprentices, and Other Things," submitted to the Liberation Daily (but not published), slandering and satirizing our professional schools and organized cultural groups as if they were raising cattle. He said: "As a result of taking both cattle and people into collectivization, the cattle have become thin, the art has become thin, and the theater troupe and publishing house have also become thin."
    Wang Ruowang's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities are not limited to writing articles. In his daily words and deeds, he is also a troublemaker who creates rumors and sows discord. When the rectification began, the Party invited non-Party members to offer opinions to the Party. As a member of the Party group of the Writers Association, Wang Ruowang did not listen to non-Party opinions. Instead, at various meetings, he exaggerated the shortcomings of the Writers Association's Party group, disregarded right and wrong, turned black and white upside down, and incited some of the masses to be dissatisfied with the Party. He falsely accused the Writers Association of being a place where "a new emperor has new courtiers" and the leaders as "power holders." He portrayed the Shanghai Writers Association's Party group as completely dark, and even scolded the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. He fabricated out of thin air that writers in the Liberated Areas were sectarian towards writers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and described the Party and Party members as "dark" and "scary." He falsely accused all principled struggles within the Party as sectarian struggles. He even wrote off the Writers Association's anti-Hu Feng struggle and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, saying they were sectarian activities. Not long ago, he also used the pseudonym Yu Tian in the Literary Gazette's Tea House column, using fabricated "facts" and the title "Ten Times the Value" to attack Comrade Sun Junqing, the current Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the Writers Association.
    These anti-Party behaviors of Wang Ruowang have almost been consistent throughout his experience. For more than 20 years, the Party has patiently educated him many times. However, he relied on his worker background, having suffered hardships, being imprisoned, being tested, and being clever and capable, as capital for making trouble with the Party. The facts are not as he boasted. We might as well take a look at his experience: He was poor as a child and worked as an apprentice. In the spring of 1934, he joined the Communist Youth League. In May of the same year, he was arrested and imprisoned. In prison, he went from wavering to betrayal and wrote a shameful confession letter "Supporting the Kuomintang and Opposing the Communist Party." But he concealed this crime from his fellow inmates (only confessed in 1947). He was released from prison in 1937 and introduced to Yan'an by the organization to study. In Yan'an, there was a famous wall newspaper "Light Cavalry Team" that peddled petty-bourgeois fanaticism and丑化 seized on the Party's individual shortcomings to丑化 [uglifying] them. Wang Ruowang was one of the initiators. In 1942, he went to the Shandong base area. In the years of intense struggle against the enemy, he drew cartoons, posted big-character posters, wrote satirical poems, and wrote essays satirizing Party leaders and magnifying the Party's shortcomings. In 1944, he was severely criticized by the Party in Shandong, and a "Wang Ruowang Ideological Exhibition" was held. The Party's conclusion on him was: a concentration of all the inferior roots of the petty bourgeoisie. Since then, under the leadership of the Party and the supervision of comrades, Wang Ruowang was superficially honest for a period of time. However, after liberation, he came to Shanghai and served as Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Deputy Secretary and Acting Director of the Party Committee of the Wu-Zhe Machinery Factory, and Deputy Editor of the Literary Monthly. His old illness relapsed, and he opposed the leadership, engaged in sectarianism, and created disputes.
    An old comrade who had worked with Wang Ruowang for many years asked him, "Why do you always want to stir up trouble wherever you go?" Wang Ruowang retorted without thinking, "Why do you always hope for peace wherever you go?" During the period of great blooming and great contending, he was smug about opposing the Party. When he encountered a little counterattack, he shamelessly sang:
    Just when I was in high spirits and dominating the situation,
    Suddenly I stumbled and fell on my head!
    If I had known this would happen, why did I do it in the first place?
    I misjudged the situation this time!
    Like all right-wing elements, Wang Ruowang really misjudged the situation. Recently, when all members of the Shanghai Writers Association launched a struggle against Wang Ruowang based on a series of his anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds, Wang Ruowang was extremely dishonest and unwilling to wear the hat of a right-wing element. Then, what is Wang Ruowang? The only answer is: He has degenerated into an unrepentant traitor to the Party.

    叛党“作家”王若望
    本报记者　夏景凡
    在资产阶级右派分子向人民发起疯狂进攻，妄想颠覆我国人民民主专政，推翻党的领导的时候，有着优秀革命传统的上海工人，忍无可忍，5月20日开了一个座谈会，严厉驳斥了右派分子的反动谬论，揭破了右派分子妄想将今天社会拖回资本主义老路上去的恶毒阴谋，这是一声响亮的警钟。但是，有个作家生气了，他马上写了一篇题为“不对头”的文章，投到解放日报（未发表），责骂工人这种可敬的行动是“不对头”！是“掩盖内部矛盾”。说只有谈缺点，才能“更接近事实。”说工人“看法陈旧”，要工人任凭右派叫嚣进攻，不许抵抗回手。
    这个甘愿充当右派分子走卒的人，就是披着共产党员外衣的作家王若望。
    章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器……之流提出要取消共产党的领导，开始受到首都先进人士反击时，王若望更火了。他以“望风测雨”为题，写给人民日报一首诗（未发表）。把反共言论叫做“莺”声，把反击右派的力量叫做“折桂斧”、“蜡枪头”，把马列主义叫做“紧箍咒”，把右派分子叫做“散花的仙子”。
    王若望在鸣放期间，从党的文艺事业到各种重大政治问题，发出了无数支毒箭。
    他在“步步设防”（见4月26日文汇报）那篇文章里，责骂党的文艺事业是“一家独鸣”，“一花独放”。他反对坚持社会主义的主流基调，反对工农兵方向，反对和毒草进行斗争，他主张党的文艺事业不要设“防”，百无禁忌。把党的一切文艺原则都称为“防”，连最起码的不要违反宪法也是“防”，也是清规戒律。他在“挖掉宗派主义老根”（见文艺月报6月号）一文中，更加集中地反对工农兵方向，打击工农兵作家，污蔑毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”是“护身符”，把坚持宣传工农兵方向的作家丑化为“歪嘴和尚”。去年4月，王若望对近千个文艺青年讲话说，你们写作品，不要先去学政策，学了政策写出来的东西保险是干巴巴公式化概念化。接着他更公然把攻击矛头指向毛主席，他说：“毛主席在关于农业合作化的高潮的报告中，把农民分成上中农和下中农，提出上中农不愿入社的也可以留在外面。如果你照毛主席的话去写，那就错了。因为，事实刚刚相反，现在农村是人人要入社，上中农比下中农还积极，差不多是奋不顾身了。”今年春天，他在上海作协召开的一次短篇小说座谈上，又重复这样意见说：“现在作家写不好作品，就是因为在你写以前要考虑对群众的教育作用，一考虑这个，写出来的东西就自然是公式化概念化了。”这些意见，不用分析就可看出他的反动主张了。
    王若望不仅对文艺工作说了许多污蔑的话，对许多重大政治问题，也都提出他的谎谬主张。他不遗余力地反对资本主义的社会主义改造，攻击公私合营企业中派公方代表的措施。在他写的“一板之隔”（见5月7日上海新闻日报）一文中，和章乃器的论调一样，说资产阶级分子已经没有两面性了，他们的心情是“竭力想给社会主义建设贡献出一分力量，但却感到插不上手”。他指责公方代表是制造隔阂，污蔑公方代表是些“内容与形式、方针和策略不一致”的“两面性人物”。王若望责问我们：公方代表就有“两面性”，“这怎么能指望改造掉资产阶级人士的两面性呢？”
    在王若望的许多文章中都谈到过对人的政治划分问题，他反对从政治上划分进步与落后，反对对人进行阶级分析。他在“释‘落后分子’”（见5月20日文汇报）一文中说：把群众分为积极分子落后分子的这种做法，是造成“宗派主义的根源之一”。又诬指落后分子等称号是“党和人事科给加上去的。”甚至在他名为斥右派分子徐仲年辱骂共产党员的文章中，（“带坑臭”——驳徐仲年，见6月21日文汇报）还替右派分子帮腔，承认共产党员和一般知识分子，甚至和徐仲年之流同样有“带坑臭”，只不过是程度上有些差别而已。在“一板之隔”和“不对头”两篇文章中，王若望抹杀工人阶级与资产阶级的本质差别，甚至宣扬资产阶级比工人阶级还要进步的反动论调。
    反党反社会主义思想已经渗透了王若望的灵魂。看到什么都在联想。看到农业合作社把牲口分散饲养的消息时，立刻写了一篇“养牛、带徒弟及其他”，投到解放日报（未发表），污蔑讽刺我们的专业学校和组织起来的文化团体像是养牛一样。他说：“连牛带人走入集体化的结果，牛瘦了，艺术瘦了，剧团和出版社也瘦了。”
    王若望反党反社会主义的活动不仅限于写文章，在日常言行里，他也是一个造谣生事，挑拨离间的害群之马。开始整风，党邀请党外人士向党提意见。作为作协党组组员的王若望，不听党外意见，反而在各种会议上，夸大作协党组缺点，不顾是非，颠倒黑白，煽动部分群众对党不满。他诬蔑作协是“一朝天子一朝臣”，领导是“当权派”。把上海作协党组说得漆黑一团，甚至把中共上海市委也骂了进去。他无中生有地捏造解放区作家对国统区作家有宗派，把党和党员描写得“阴暗”“可怕”，把党内一切原则斗争，都诬指成宗派斗争。甚至把作协的反胡风斗争和肃反运动，也一笔抹煞，说是宗派活动。不久以前他还化名俞田，在文艺报茶座栏里，用捏造的“事实”，以“身价十倍”为题，攻击现在的作协党组副书记孙峻青同志。
    王若望这些反党行为，在他的经历中几乎带有一贯性。二十多年来，党曾多次对他进行耐心教育。但是他自恃工人出身，受过苦，坐过牢，经过考验，聪明能干，作为向党闹的资本。事实并不像他吹嘘的那样。我们不妨看看他的经历：他少年时家贫，当过学徒。1934年春参加共青团，同年5月被捕入狱，在狱中，他由动摇到叛变，曾写过“拥护国民党，反对共产党”的可耻的自首书。但在难友面前掩盖了自己这一罪行（1947年才交代）。1937年出狱，经组织介绍到延安学习。在延安有个贩卖小资产阶级狂热病、抓住党的个别缺点加以丑化的有名的墙报“轻骑队”，王若望就是发起人之一。1942年到山东根据地。在对敌斗争紧张的年月里，他画漫画、贴大字报、写讽刺诗、写杂文丑化党的领导，扩大党的缺点。1944年在山东受到党的严厉批判，并开过“王若望思想展览会”，党对他的结论是：集中小资产阶级一切劣根性之大成。此后，在党的领导与同志们的监督下，王若望表面上老实了一个时期。可是，解放以后，他来到上海，在上海总工会任文教部副部长，在吴浙机器厂任党委副书记代厂长和任文艺月报副主编期间，老病再发，反领导、闹宗派、闹纠纷。
    和王若望一同工作过多年的老同志问他：“你每到一个地方总是唯恐天下不乱，这是为什么？”王若望毫不考虑的反问说：“你们每到一个地方总是希望平静，这是为什么？”在大鸣大放的时候，他反党反得洋洋得意。遇到一点反击，还无耻地唱道：
    正当风云叱咤得意时候，
    猛可里忒楞楞栽了个斤斗！
    早知今日，何必当初，
    偏偏儿这一遭看错了气候！
    王若望像所有右派分子一样，真是看错了气候。最近上海作协全体会员根据王若望一系列的反党反社会主义的言行，向王若望展开斗争时，王若望极不老实，不愿戴右派分子的帽子。那末，王若望是个什么呢？答复只能是：他已经沦为不思悔改的党的叛徒。
