Only "Shoveling" Allowed, No "Collecting"
    Meng Lingshi, a rightist element in the Education Section of the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau, used many malicious metaphors during the rectification campaign to sow discord between the Party and non-Party members. For example, he said: "There is an electric fence between the Party and non-Party members in the salt field, and people have to risk their lives to cross it." "Non-Party members in a revolutionary family are like little daughters-in-law; they can only smile at their parents-in-law, not jump at them; they can only say the younger sister-in-law is good, not say the younger sister-in-law is bad." He even directed his spearhead at the Party Central Committee, saying, "The sectarianism of the Party organization in the salt field is deeply rooted and permeated from the Party's root in Beijing."
    In the anti-rightist struggle, Meng Lingshi's anti-Party fallacies were fiercely denounced by the salt field workers. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, he said something like, "I'm just playing with words," and declared that he would withdraw all his previous speeches and invalidate them, "as if I hadn't said anything."
    Meng Lingshi's attempt to "collect" his reactionary remarks is impossible. These rightist elements should be warned: Poisonous weeds are always poisonous weeds; they are poisonous weeds when released, and they are still poisonous weeds when not released. If they are not released today, they will grow bigger tomorrow. Playing rogue is useless, regretting the past is unnecessary, you should just honestly take off your pants and cut off your tails!

    只能“铲”不能“收”
    淮北盐务局教育科的右派分子孟令石，在整风期间，用了许多恶毒的比喻，挑拨党和非党的关系。例如他说：“盐场党和非党之间隔着一道电网，人们要过电网非得拼着性命不可。”“非党员在革命家庭里像个小媳妇，只能朝公婆笑，不能朝公婆跳；只能说小姑好，不能说小姑坏。”他甚至把矛头指向了党中央，说“盐场党组织的宗派主义是从北京党根深蒂固的渗透下来的”。
    在反右派斗争中，孟令石的反党谬论，遭到盐场职工的痛斥。他看到大势不妙，就说什么“我仅是‘笔墨游戏’，并声明要把他以前的发言全部收回作废，就“算我没有讲过”。
    孟令石想“收回”他的反动言论，是办不到的。应该正告这些右派分子：毒草总是毒草，放出来是毒草，不放出来还是毒草。今天不放出来，明天就会长得更大。耍无赖既无用，悔当初也不必，还是老老实实脱裤子割尾巴吧！
