Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, August 27th. The construction speed of Jilin City's chemical industry is accelerating. In late August, the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the Central Committee's policy of vigorously developing the relatively weak chemical industry, convened a meeting of relevant departments to decide to take all effective measures to ensure that the Jilin Fertilizer Plant is fully put into production before National Day, and strive for the Jilin Dye Plant's six important workshops and the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant's calcium cyanamide workshop to also be put into production before National Day. It is expected that before National Day, the output of chemical fertilizers from the Jilin Fertilizer Plant will increase four times compared to now; the Jilin Dye Plant can produce a variety of high-grade dyes such as An'an Blue; and the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant can also produce calcium cyanamide needed for industrial construction.

These three large-scale basic chemical plants are key construction projects during China's First Five-Year Plan period, originally planned to be completed next year. Thanks to the construction workers overcoming numerous difficulties and accelerating the construction speed, all three plants can be put into production ahead of schedule. The Jilin Fertilizer Plant has now been completed, and the first set of equipment was put into production in late July. The Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant also began producing calcium carbide as early as the end of May.

While accelerating construction, the workers of these three factories also found ways to save state investment. In the first half of this year alone, the rationalization proposals put forward by the engineering and technical personnel of the three factories saved the state more than 9 million yuan.

These three factories are huge in scale and have advanced production technology. Their construction marks a new development in China's modern chemical industry. The chemical fertilizer produced by the Jilin Fertilizer Plant—ammonium nitrate—is of good quality and low cost. The main raw materials for chemical fertilizer are inexhaustible water, air, and low-quality coal. After the entire plant is completed and put into production, it can produce a large amount of chemical fertilizer to meet the needs of agricultural production. The more than 40 kinds of high-grade dyes and dye intermediates produced by the Jilin Dye Plant could not be mass-produced in China in the past. It is estimated that after the first phase of the Jilin Dye Plant is put into production, it can basically meet the national need for dyeing blue cloth. The calcium carbide produced by the Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant can be used to synthesize artificial fibers, as well as plastics, rubber, and so on. Next year, the Jilin Fertilizer Plant will also be expanded. After the expansion, it can also use nitric acid, synthetic ammonia, and other products to produce artificial fibers such as Kapron. The production of this artificial fiber is one of the ways to solve the problem of clothing for the Chinese people in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 26th. The Shanghai Chemical Raw Material Industry Company recently expanded thirteen small and medium-sized chemical plants with the least amount of money, solving the problem of insufficient supply of ten kinds of chemical raw materials urgently needed for industrial production.

The expansion projects of the thirteen factories generally only took two or three months. After the expansion was completed, the output of six kinds of chemical raw materials that were originally in short supply on the market increased by 30% to 100%, and the four kinds of raw materials that were previously dependent on imports, such as caustic potash, thorium nitrate, borax, and boric acid, began to be produced domestically. At the beginning of this year, the Shanghai enamel and glass industries almost stopped production due to the lack of borax and boric acid. The Municipal Chemical Raw Material Company immediately invested in the expansion of the Daxin Chemical Plant and the Shanghai No. 2 Sodium Silicate Plant; two months later, these two plants produced a large amount of borax and boric acid, ensuring the normal production of the enamel and glass industries.

The total investment of these factories was only over 100,000 yuan, and some factories even only used 4,000 or 5,000 yuan, but the investment effect was very good. The Jinxing Chemical Plant added some urgently needed chemical reaction and crystallization equipment for more than 4,000 yuan, and at the same time strengthened technical measures, so that the output of ammonium chloride increased by about 100% compared with the past. The profit in the first half of this year also increased by more than 100,000 yuan compared with the second half of last year. The profit increased by this one factory in half a year alone recovered all the investment of the thirteen factories.

In the process of expansion, these factories concentrated their investment on the most needed and weakest production links. Some factories tried to use idle and surplus machinery and equipment originally used to produce other products, and the workers and technicians modified them themselves. (Attached picture)

### 对粮食增产和衣着供应将有重大贡献　三大化工厂可提前建成  上海十三个中小型化工厂扩建完工

　  对粮食增产和衣着供应将有重大贡献
　　三大化工厂可提前建成
    上海十三个中小型化工厂扩建完工
    本报长春27日电　吉林市化学工业的建设速度正在加快。8月下旬，中共吉林市委根据中央大力发展比较薄弱的化学工业的方针，召集有关部门开会，决定采取一切有效措施，保证吉林肥料厂提前在国庆节前全部投入生产，争取吉林染料厂六个重要车间和吉林电石厂碳氮化钙车间也提前在国庆节前投入生产。预计在国庆节前夕，吉林肥料厂化学肥料的产量将比现在增多四倍；吉林染料厂可以生产出安安蓝等多种高级染料；吉林电石厂也可以生产出工业建设需要的碳氮化钙。
    这三个大型基本化学工厂都是我国第一个五年计划期间的重点建设工程，原计划明年建成。由于建厂职工克服重重困难，加快了施工速度，三个厂都可以提前投入生产。现在吉林肥料厂已经建成，第一套设备已在7月下旬投入生产。吉林电石厂也早在5月底就开始生产电石。
    这三个工厂的职工在加快建设的同时，还想办法节约国家投资。仅今年上半年，三个厂的工程技术人员所提出的合理化建议，就为国家节约九百多万元。
    这三个工厂规模巨大，生产技术都很先进。它们的建设，标志着我国现代化学工业的新发展。吉林肥料厂生产的化学肥料——硝酸铵，质量很好，成本又低。化学肥料的主要原料，是取之不尽的水、空气和劣质煤。全厂建成投入生产后，可大量生产化学肥料供应农业生产的需要。吉林染料厂生产的四十多种高级染料和制造染料的中间体，都是我国过去不能大量生产的。据估计，吉林染料厂第一期工程投入生产后，就可以基本上满足全国染蓝布的需要。吉林电石厂生产的电石可以合成人造纤维，也可以合成塑料、橡胶等等。明年吉林肥料厂还要扩建，扩建后还可以用硝酸、合成氨和其他产品，来生产卡普隆等类的人造纤维。这种人造纤维的生产，是解决我国人民今后穿衣问题的途径之一。
    新华社上海26日电　上海市化学原料工业公司不久前以最少的钱扩建了十三个中小型化工厂，解决了工业生产急需的十种化工原料供应不足的问题。
    十三个厂的扩建工程，一般都只花了两三个月的时间。扩建完成以后，使六种原来市场上供应不足的化工原料产量提高了三成到一倍，并且使过去依靠进口的苛性钾、硝酸钍、硼砂、硼酸等四种原料开始自己生产。今年年初，上海搪瓷、玻璃工业因为缺少硼砂、硼酸，几乎停工减产。市化工原料公司马上投资扩建了大新化学厂和上海第二泡花碱厂；两个月以后，这两个厂就生产了大量硼砂、硼酸，保证了搪瓷和玻璃工业的生产得以正常进行。
    这些厂的投资总额只有十多万元，有的厂甚至只用了四、五千元，但是投资效果很好。金星化工厂用四千多元增添了一些急需的化学反应和结晶设备，同时加强了技术措施，使氯化铵的产量比过去增加一倍左右。今年上半年的利润，也比去年下半年增加了十多万元。仅这一个厂半年时间所增加的利润，就收回了十三个厂全部的投资。
    在扩建过程中，这些厂都把投资集中使用在最需要的和最薄弱的生产环节上。有的厂尽量利用原来生产其他产品的闲置和多余的机器设备，由工人和技术人员自己动手加以改装。（附图片）
