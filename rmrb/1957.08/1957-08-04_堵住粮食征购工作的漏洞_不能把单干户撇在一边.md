    Plug Loopholes in Grain Procurement Work
    Don't Leave Individual Households Aside
    In Nanqiao Township, Xunwu County, Jiangxi Province, there are 46 individual farming households, accounting for 2.85% of the total number of households. When implementing the "Three Fixes" policy, their public grain task was determined to be 10,459 catties, accounting for 2.5% of the township's total task; the grain purchase task was 22,114 catties, accounting for 3% of the township's total task. Last year, the actual completion of public grain was 9,871 catties, with 10 households failing to meet their task. The completion of grain purchase was 11,591 catties, with 29 households failing to meet their task.
    Why was the grain procurement task completed so poorly? The main reason is the relaxation of leadership and management over them, leading individual households to adopt an attitude of "delay if possible, owe if possible," and simply drag it out.
    Some people believe that "there are few individual households, the impact is not significant." Is this correct? The answer is: no. Because the failure of individual households to complete their tasks will similarly affect the overall completion of the township's tasks; because individual households fail to complete their tasks and retain more grain, they engage in speculation and profiteering, thereby affecting market order; at the same time, this situation will also cause dissatisfaction among some commune members, and even affect the enthusiasm of some people (mainly former surplus grain households - wealthy households) to take the socialist road. Therefore, although the amount of grain procured from individual households is not large, it reflects the struggle between two roads, especially the struggle between the remnants of capitalist ideology and socialist ideology.
    Nanqiao Township, learning from last year's experience, strengthened its leadership and management of individual households this summer: (1) Convened meetings of individual households to conduct patriotism, socialism, and worker-peasant alliance education, and publicized the procurement policy. At the same time, the procurement tasks for the entire year and summer were arranged, calling on them to consciously and timely complete the task in full and with quality. (2) The grassroots government organizations strengthened leadership and management over them, urging them to complete their tasks on time. Grain levy and purchase are their own responsibility to turn in to the granary, and the method of contracted responsibility by agricultural cooperatives is not adopted. (3) They should be treated with the desire for unity, strengthen ideological education, and continuously improve their socialist ideological consciousness; at the same time, those who have actual difficulties should also be helped to solve them according to different circumstances. However, necessary restrictions should be taken or dealt with according to law against individual speculators and profiteers. A comprehensive cleanup of the completion of the procurement tasks last year was also carried out. Liu Xuchun

### 堵住粮食征购工作的漏洞  不能把单干户撇在一边

    堵住粮食征购工作的漏洞
    不能把单干户撇在一边
    江西省寻乌县南桥乡有单干农民四十六户。占总农户2.85％，实行“三定”政策时，确定他们的公粮任务是一万零四百五十九斤，占全乡总任务的2.5％。购粮任务二万二千一百一十四斤，占全乡总任务的3％。去年实际完成公粮九千八百七十一斤，有十户没有完成任务。完成购粮一万一千五百九十一斤，有二十九户没有完成任务。
    为什么粮食征购任务完成的这样差呢？主要原因是由于放松了对他们的领导与管理，单干户就采取“能拖就拖，能欠就欠”的态度，拖过去了。
    有人认为“单干户很少，影响不大”，这对不对呢？事实的回答是：不对。因为单干户的任务未完成，同样会影响全乡任务的全面完成；由于单干户未完成任务，留粮多，他们就进行投机倒把，从而影响了市场秩序；同时，这种情况也会引起部分社员的不满，甚至影响了一些人（主要是过去的余粮户——富裕户）走社会主义道路的积极性。因此，单干户粮食征购数量虽不多，但是，它反映着两条道路的斗争问题，特别是资本主义思想残余和社会主义思想的斗争问题。
    南桥乡接受去年的经验教训，在今年夏季，对单干户加强了领导和管理：（1）召开单干户会议，进行爱国主义、社会主义和工农联盟教育，宣传征购政策。同时，布置今年全年和夏季的征购任务，号召他们自觉地按时按质如数完成任务。（2）由基层政权组织对他们加强领导和管理，督促他们按时完成任务。征粮和购粮由其自己负责缴库，不采用农业社包干办法。（3）对他们应从团结的愿望出发，加强思想教育，不断提高他们的社会主义思想觉悟；同时对他们中有实际困难的也应分别不同情况帮助解决。但是对个别搞投机倒把的应采取必要的限制或依法处理。对去年征购任务完成情况也进行了全面的清理工作。刘旭春
