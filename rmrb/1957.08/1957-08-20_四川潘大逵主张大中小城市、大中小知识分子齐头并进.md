Sichuan is an important stronghold of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. Pan Dakui, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, was one of the key figures they placed in Sichuan. Pan Dakui's subordinates included Zhao Yiming, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and Shu Jun, Director of the Organization Department and Li Kang, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. They were all active executors of Zhang-Luo's plan to recruit and buy over personnel.

Since the proposal of the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," Pan Dakui and Zhao Yiming actively publicized Zhang-Luo's instructions, aiming to expand the League's organization in Sichuan from 2,500 members to 4,000 by the end of 1957.

Pan Dakui advocated that democratic parties should not have divisions of labor and should break down boundaries. Luo Longji believed that people who had been under surveillance and those who were dissatisfied with various movements were the best targets for the Democratic League's development. Pan Dakui actively recruited these people into the League. Among the thirteen people listed as development targets by the Southwest Nationalities College Democratic League organization from February to August this year, twelve were escaped and already dealt with counter-revolutionaries, reactionary Kuomintang backbone elements, and those with extreme dissatisfaction with the Party. Wei Shizhen, whom Luo Longji and Pan Dakui greatly admired and repeatedly suggested could join the League, was originally a central committee member of the reactionary Youth Party before liberation and the head of the Youth Party in Sichuan Province.

Some elements who were dissatisfied with the Party and had strong personal political ambitions were even better targets for the Zhang-Luo group's "major development." Pan Dakui demanded "continuous development" at the provincial party committee's enlarged meeting in February this year, saying that organizational procedures could be disregarded in developing the organization, considering them merely "formalities." Zhang Bojun once pointed out that a large number of over-age members of the Communist Youth League were retiring from the League, and they needed "organizational warmth," making them potential targets for development. Pan Dakui resolutely implemented this instruction. He also decided to develop in the forty-five counties with only League groups, even though they did not have the conditions for development, demanding simultaneous advancement of large, medium, and small cities, and large, medium, and small intellectuals.

Pan Dakui also repeatedly criticized the League's development as too "conservative," saying, "Out of five million intellectuals, the League has less than 30,000 members. Sichuan, such a large province, only has more than 2,000 people, which is too pitiful!"

League members Zhong Guihua and Wang Fuxiao revealed that Zhang Mosheng, Wu Zhongpu, and Zhang Chonggu of the Nanchong Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League in Sichuan emphasized vigorously developing in medicine and health, literature and art, and government offices. In addition to vigorously developing at Nanchong Normal College, they also planned to develop extensively in middle schools and would not relax opportunities in primary schools. They also developed freely in Xichong, Langzhong, Yingshan, Peng'an, and Yilong counties. At the same time, they sent cadres to Yingshan and Peng'an to understand the situation and assist in formulating development work plans. In the development process, they emphasized developing middle and backward elements, and those who often opposed the Party or supported their anti-Party remarks were all taken as development targets. On the contrary, those who leaned towards the Party were not accepted. (According to Sichuan Daily)

### 四川潘大逵主张大中小城市、大中小知识分子齐头并进

    四川潘大逵主张大中小城市、大中小知识分子齐头并进
    四川是章罗联盟的一个重要据点。民盟四川省主任委员潘大逵就是他们安插在四川的一员大将。潘大逵的手下还有民盟四川省委副秘书长赵一明、民盟重庆市委组织部长舒军、宣传部长李康，他们都是章罗招兵买马计划的积极执行者。
    从“长期共存、互相监督”的方针提出以后，潘大逵、赵一明就积极宣传章罗的指示，要把四川的盟组织在1957年底从二千五百人发展到四千人。
    潘大逵主张民主党派可以不要分工，要打破界限。罗隆基认为被管制过的和对各项运动不满的人是民盟最好的发展对象。潘大逵就积极拉这些人入盟。西南民族学院民盟组织列为今年2至8月发展对象的十三人中，有十二个是漏网的和已处理过的反革命分子、反动党团骨干分子和对党有极大不满的分子。罗隆基、潘大逵非常倾心、几次提议可以入盟的魏时珍，原来是解放前反动的青年党的中央委员兼青年党的四川省主任委员。
    一些对党不满而又有着强烈个人政治野心的分子更是章罗集团“大发展”的好对象。潘大逵曾在今年2月省委扩大会议上要求“川流不息地发展”，说发展组织可以不按组织手续，认为那只是“形式”。章伯钧曾指出现在大批超龄的共青团员要退团，而他们需要“组织的温暖”，这都是可以发展的对象。潘大逵就坚决执行这个指示。还决定在并不具备发展条件的四十五个只有盟小组的县里发展，要求大中小城市、大中小知识分子齐头并进。
    潘大逵还一再批评盟的发展太“保守”，说“五百万知识分子，盟员还不到三万，四川偌大一个省才二千多人，太可怜了！”
    盟员钟贵华、王拂晓揭露民盟四川南充市委张默生、吴仲垺、张崇古强调在医药卫生、文艺、机关等方面也大力进行发展，除在南充师专大力发展外，并准备在中学大量发展，小学也不放松机会。在西充、阆中、营山、蓬安、仪陇等县也放手发展。同时还派干部到营山、蓬安了解情况协助订出发展工作计划。在发展中，强调要发展中间和落后分子，对经常与党闹对立的或支持他们反党言论的都作为发展对象。相反，对党靠拢的人就不吸收。　　　（据四川日报）
