(Our Nanjing dispatch) In the recent half month or so, the Jiusan Society's Nanjing Branch and Nanjing Normal College have revealed the mystery of the Jiusan Society's Nanjing Branch's once ambiguous attitude in the anti-rightist struggle. It turns out that a rightist clique headed by Gao Juefu, a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, chairman of the Nanjing Branch, and vice president of Nanjing Normal College, used the Jiusan Society's Nanjing Branch as an anti-Party tool to actively engage in conspiracies to oppose the Communist Party's leadership in institutions of higher learning.

Gao Juefu's opposition to the Party's leadership in institutions of higher learning was linked to the rightist elements in the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, and was also conspired with Zhou Shilu, member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, deputy director of the Jiusan Nanjing Branch, and rightist element, and Ni Hesheng, secretary director of the Nanjing Branch and part-time reporter for Guangming Daily appointed by Chu Anping. They often held symposiums that Party newspaper reporters were not allowed to attend, and frequently held late-night secret talks. This "psychologist" completely misjudged the psychology of the masses and the strength of the Party, and brazenly declared during the blooming and contending that "the Party committee is weak and powerless" and "the Communist Party has collapsed, and it is time for the democratic parties to play a role." At the Second Plenary Session of the Jiusan Society, Gao Juefu and Zhou Shilu openly advocated "great development." At a symposium held by Guangming Daily in Nanjing, Gao Juefu publicly declared that "whether the Party should conduct specific leadership over institutions of higher learning" still needed to be studied. He also held seven blooming and contending symposiums in a row, setting fires everywhere in higher education, science and technology, and the medical field. His accomplice Zhou Shilu openly usurped the leadership of the rectification campaign at the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, established a study committee without Party and government leadership, and at a meeting of responsible persons of various grassroots branches of the Nanjing Jiusan Branch, Gao Juefu also "recommended" the method of the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences to the grassroots, saying that the experience of usurping the Party's leadership over the rectification campaign there was worth learning. Gao Juefu also actively carried out activities to set fires and exclude Party member leadership in Nanjing Normal College, this grassroots unit. He actively initiated and supported the joint convening of symposiums by the four democratic party organizations of Nanjing Normal University to help the Party in its rectification campaign, but excluded the leadership of the Party committee. He also publicized a document from the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society that distorted Chairman Mao's speech to the professors of the Education Department of Nanjing Normal University, saying that "the Party committee system in institutions of higher learning should be considered for abolition." At the same time, Gao Juefu also submitted two articles to Wenhui Daily, scolding "the Ministry of Education for leading higher normal education astray," scolding the Party member vice minister of the Ministry of Education, and also scolding the Party member vice president for being "too stupid" and the Party member department secretary for monitoring non-Party members. This series of remarks shows that he vainly attempted to eliminate the Party organization from the central government to the universities and then to the departments.

Attendees further exposed the ugly history of Gao Juefu, this "psychologist": he gave non-academic speeches at the Youth Cadre School run by Chiang Ching-kuo, studied for Chiang Kai-shek why the morale of the Kuomintang army was low, he also helped Li Zongren engage in the pseudo-presidential election, he himself also participated in the election of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan, and signed the false peace declaration, and also viciously cursed the Communist Party as "Communist bandits."

After everyone's exposure and criticism, Gao Juefu admitted that he was "carrying out anti-Party activities in a planned and step-by-step manner," and also admitted that there was a line of "Chu Anping - Gao Juefu - Ni Hesheng."

Now the Nanjing Jiusan Branch has established a rectification work committee without the participation of Gao Juefu, Zhou Shilu, Ni Hesheng and others, setting off a wave of anti-rightist struggle within the society.

### “心理学家”错误估计了群众的心理  高觉敷右派集团被揭露

    “心理学家”错误估计了群众的心理
    高觉敷右派集团被揭露
    本报南京讯　最近半个多月来，九三学社南京分社和南京师范学院，揭开了九三学社南京分社在反右派斗争中一度态度暧昧之谜。原来那时以九三学社中央委员、南京分社主委、南京师范学院副院长高觉敷为首的一个右派集团，利用九三学社南京分社作为反党工具，积极从事反对共产党在高等院校的领导的阴谋活动。
    高觉敷反对党在高等院校的领导是和九三学社中央的右派分子联成一气的，也是和九三学社中委、九三南京分社副主任委员、右派分子周拾禄以及南京分社秘书主任、储安平委派的光明日报南京兼职记者倪鹤笙等共谋的。他们经常召开不要党报记者参加的座谈会，和经常进行深夜密谈。这位“心理学家”完全错估了群众心理和党的力量，在鸣放中猖狂地宣称“党委软弱无力了”、“共产党已经垮下去了，是民主党派发挥作用的时候了。”在九三学社二中全会上，高觉敷和周拾禄公开主张“大发展”，在光明日报在南京召开的座谈会上，高觉敷公然宣称“党对高等院校是否要进行具体领导”还要研究，他还连续召开了七次鸣放座谈会，在高教、科技和医药界到处点火。而他的同谋者周拾禄则公然篡夺了华东农科所的整风领导权，成立了不要党政领导的学习委员会，在南京九三分社的各基层支社负责人会议上，高觉敷还把华东农科所的办法向各基层“推荐”，说那里篡夺党对整风领导权的经验是值得学习的。高觉敷在南京师范学院这个基层里，也积极进行了点火和排斥党员领导的活动。他积极发起和支持南师四个民主党派组织联合召开的帮助党整风但又排斥党委领导的座谈会。并向南师教育系的教授们宣扬九三学社中央发来的一个歪曲毛主席讲话的文件，说什么“高等院校党委制要考虑撤消”。同时，高觉敷还向文汇报两次投稿，骂“教育部把高师教育引入了歧途”。骂教育部的党员副部长，他还骂党员副院长“太笨”、骂党员系秘书是监视党外人士的，这一系列言论可以说明他妄想从中央到院校，再到系一起把党组织取消掉。
    到会者还进一步揭发了高觉敷这个“心理学家”的丑恶历史：他在蒋经国办的青年干部学校里，作过非学术性的演讲，替蒋介石研究过国民党军队为何士气不振，他还帮助李宗仁搞伪大总统竞选，他自己也参加过伪立法院的选举，并在假和平宣言上签过名，还曾恶毒地骂共产党为“共匪”。
    经过大家的揭发和批判，高觉敷承认了自己是“有计划、有步骤的进行反党活动的”，也承认有“储安平—高觉敷—倪鹤笙”这条线。
    现在南京九三分社已成立了没有高觉敷、周拾禄、倪鹤笙等人参加的整风工作委员会，掀起了社内的反右派斗争热潮。
