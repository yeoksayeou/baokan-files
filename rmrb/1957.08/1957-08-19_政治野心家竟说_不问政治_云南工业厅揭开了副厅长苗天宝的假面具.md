    Political Careerist Actually Claimed to "Not Ask About Politics"
    Yunnan Industrial Bureau Exposes Deputy Director Miao Tianbao's Mask
    (Our Newspaper News) Rightist Miao Tianbao, the Deputy Director of the Yunnan Provincial Industrial Bureau and a member of the preparatory committee of the Jiusan Society in Yunnan, consistently portrayed himself as "not caring about politics" before the rectification campaign. He even said, "I won't be an official if you want me to, I won't seize power if you want me to, I only hope to be an engineer or teacher in a factory or middle school, just enough to have a bowl of rice to eat."
    But when the rectification began, Miao Tianbao became interested in politics. He also incited others to say, "Speak out boldly, release your opinions freely, don't have any concerns, if you say something wrong, you can take it back, I studied law and can represent you in court." He also said, "The Party cannot lead senior intellectuals, it cannot lead natural science, it should be led by the 'Jiusan Society'." He said, "Now I am suffering every day, I feel like I am in danger of being killed or arrested. When I was in Germany, Hitler was a murderous demon, but I didn't feel like he would kill me, I didn't feel terror." On June 9th, a group of rightist elements from the "Jiusan Society" within the Industrial Bureau, led by Miao Tianbao, held a meeting at Miao's home and laid out a plan to actively develop the organization. Miao Tianbao said, "We must introduce all the engineering and technical personnel of the Industrial Bureau system, regardless of old or young, progressive or backward, to the 'Jiusan Society'." He said, "We must contend with Director Ma (a Party member)." After the meeting, rightist elements Miao Tianbao, Shen Renxiang, Su Shuxun, and other rightist elements began to act separately, but this conspiracy was soon exposed by the masses and went bankrupt.

    政治野心家竟说“不问政治”
    云南工业厅揭开了副厅长苗天宝的假面具
    本报讯　云南省工业厅副厅长右派分子苗天宝是九三学社云南筹委会委员，在整风前，一贯标榜自己“不关心政治”。甚至说：“要我当官我不干，要我抓权我不抓，我只希望到工厂或中学当个工程师或教师有碗饭吃就够了。”
    但整风开始，苗天宝变得对政治有兴趣了。还煽动别人说：“大胆鸣，大胆放，不要有顾虑，说错了，可以收回，我学过法律，可以为你们上公堂。”又说：“党不能领导高级知识分子，不能领导自然科学，应由‘九三’来领导”。他说：“现在天天在受罪，感到有被杀被抓的危险。我在德国时，希特勒是杀人魔王，我却没有感到会杀到我，没有感到恐怖”。6月9日，以苗天宝为首的工业厅内的一伙“九三”的右派分子，在苗的家里开会，订出了积极发展组织的计划。苗天宝说：“要把工业厅系统的工程技术人员，不分老的小的，进步的落后的，统统地介绍到‘九三’来”。他说：“要同马厅长（党员）分庭抗礼”。会后，右派分子苗天宝、沈仁湘、苏树勋等右派分子即开始分头活动，但这个阴谋在群众揭发下不久就告破产了。
