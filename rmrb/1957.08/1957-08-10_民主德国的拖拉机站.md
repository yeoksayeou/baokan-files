The first socialist economic organizations in the rural areas of the German Democratic Republic were four thousand machine rental stations. The establishment of these stations began in 1949, and the collectivization movement only started four years later.

This situation was inseparable from the class conditions and production conditions in the German countryside. Comrade Mückenberger, the Minister of Agriculture of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, told us: "The agricultural collectivization in the German Democratic Republic began after the establishment of a technological foundation. The reason is that capitalist management was relatively developed in German agricultural production in the past, and the level of mechanization was also very high. Middle peasants generally had a lot of agricultural machinery. Without a strong material foundation to support collectivization, it would be difficult to win over the large number of middle peasants to participate in cooperatives."

According to the regulations of the German Democratic Republic government, farmers with less than five hectares of land are considered small farmers, those with five to twenty hectares are middle farmers, and those with twenty to ninety-nine hectares are rich farmers. According to this calculation, after the land reform from 1945 to 1948, small farmers accounted for 45.4% of the total number of farmers, and middle farmers accounted for 48.5%; small farmers accounted for 10.7% of the cultivated land area, and middle farmers accounted for 59.6%. It is clear that winning over the middle peasants to participate in cooperatives is very important, both from a political and economic point of view.

The task of agricultural collectivization was initially undertaken by machine rental stations and later by tractor stations. When we visited the Petz tractor station in the Potsdam district, the first thing they told us was: "The task of the Petz tractor station is to provide economic and political support for the cause of collectivization in thirty-three villages and thirteen cooperatives."

The German Democratic Republic currently has 605 tractor stations, which are the main force in agricultural production. According to the 1956 statistics, the proportion of the workload of tractor stations in various agricultural tasks is as follows: plowing—61.3%, harrowing—21.5%, planting potatoes—15.8%, tilling—20.7%, grain harvesting—60.2%, digging potatoes—25%, digging sugar beets—16.7%.

Although tractor stations also cultivate land for individual farmers, their main strength is to provide support to cooperatives. In the Halle district, cooperatives account for more than 78% of the land cultivated by tractors. This proportion is about the same nationwide. According to state regulations, the charging standard for tractor stations cultivating land for cooperatives is 20% lower than that for individual farmers; the charging standard for cultivating land for permanent mutual aid teams is 10% lower than that for individual farmers.

In nearly ten years of production practice, the work of tractor stations has been significantly improved. Materials from the Duckow tractor station in the Neubrandenburg district show that from 1951 to 1956, the cultivated area increased from 12,000 hectares to 35,000 hectares, the cultivation cost per hectare decreased from 69 marks to 46 marks, and the output value per tractor driver per year increased from 10,400 marks to 18,400 marks.

However, the most common problem with tractor stations at present is still the high cost and the large state subsidies. In order to help us understand this situation specifically, the chief accountant of the Petz tractor station unreservedly took out the 1956 ledger from the safe and made accurate calculations: In the past year, the total income of this tractor station was 542,000 marks, the total expenditure was 1.61 million marks, and the state subsidy was 1.068 million marks. The situation of the Duckow tractor station is better, and the state still subsidized 890,000 marks last year. And these accounts do not include state construction investment. In 1956, the state invested a total of 331 million marks to increase the construction and equipment of tractor stations nationwide.

This operating situation of tractor stations has been exaggerated by some revisionists and used as an excuse to oppose the socialist transformation of agriculture. Professor Ferwick of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a representative. He advocated dissolving tractor stations in three stages: First, sell the machinery of tractor stations to farmers who have cash; second, the remaining machinery will be used by tractor stations to form joint-stock companies with farmers, with farmers holding 50% of the shares; third, the machinery of the joint-stock companies will be gradually sold to farmer shareholders through installment payments. The essence of this proposal is to abolish the pillar of socialism in the countryside and allow wealthy middle peasants and rich peasants to gradually develop capitalist farms.

Ferwick's anti-socialist remarks have been opposed by the broad masses of working people. The staff of the tractor stations in the German Democratic Republic and the national leaders are full of confidence to further run this important socialist cause well. Starting in 1957, the economic accounting system has been implemented in thirty tractor stations. The Petz tractor station is one of these thirty. The director of this tractor station carefully analyzed the past situation and the direction of future efforts for us.

He said: Where are we losing money? Because the cost of cultivating each hectare of land is 40 to 54 marks, but we only charge 20 to 24 marks. The reasons for the high cost are: First, there are fewer cooperatives and more small pieces of land for individuals, which is not cost-effective to cultivate. Second, the labor force organization is not good, and the efficiency of the machinery has not been fully utilized. For example, some tractor teams have a downtime of only three hours per month due to machine damage or other reasons, while others have a downtime of 100 hours.

But—he said—we are fully confident of striving not to lose money. In our tractor station, the cultivation cost of one production team last year has been reduced to 29 marks per hectare. In order to implement the economic accounting system, a labor rate work competition is now underway, calculated on an hourly basis. This competition will greatly stimulate the improvement of productivity.

The movement to strive for no state subsidies has now actually been launched nationwide. The central content of this movement is to cultivate more land and reduce downtime. Comrade Mückenberger said in response to our question: The key to the profitability of tractor stations lies in better utilization of machinery. Five years ago, each standard horsepower tractor worked an average of 160 hectares of land per year, calculated at medium depth. In 1956, it reached 360 hectares, and this year we strive to reach 380 hectares; in the next few years, if we can reach 500 hectares, this can fundamentally change the situation.

He said: In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to continue to connect the land into one piece and continuously strengthen labor organization and labor discipline. To this end, the state is studying the reform of the wage system for tractor drivers, so that their wages are determined by the level of output per unit area.

Finally, he told us with certainty: "It will take about five years for all tractor stations to achieve profitability."

    民主德国的拖拉机站
    王揖
    民主德国在农村里的第一批社会主义经济组织，是四千个机器出租站。建站的时间开始于1949年，而四年以后，才有了合作化运动。
    这种情况，是同德国农村的阶级情况和生产条件分不开的。德国统一社会党中央农业部长穆肯伯尔格同志告诉我们：“德意志民主共和国的农业合作化是在首先建立了技术基础以后才开始的。原因是过去德国农业生产中资本主义经营比较发达，机械化水平也很高，中农一般地都有很多农业机器；如果没有雄厚的物质基础给合作化撑腰，就很难争取为数众多的中农参加合作社。”
    按照民主德国政府的规定，五公顷土地以下的农户为小农，五至二十公顷者为中农，二十至九十九公顷者为富农。根据这个规定计算，也就是说，在1945至1948年土改以后，在农户中小农占45.4％，中农占48.5％；在耕地面积中小农占10.7％，中农占59.6％。由此可见，争取中农参加合作社，无论从政治的或经济的利益来看，都是十分重要的。
    农业合作化的任务，最初是由机器出租站、以后又由拖拉机站担负起来了。我们访问波茨坦专区佩兹拖拉机站的时候，他们告诉我们的第一句话就是：“佩兹拖拉机站的任务，是在三十三个乡和十三个合作社中对合作化的事业进行经济的和政治的支持”。
    民主德国目前共有六百零五个拖拉机站，它是农业生产的主力。据1956年的统计，拖拉机站的工作量在各种农业劳动中所占的比重如下：耕地——61.3％，碎土——21.5％，种土豆——15.8％，翻土——20.7％，粮食收割——60.2％，挖土豆——25％，挖甜菜——16.7％。
    尽管拖拉机站也为个体农民耕种，但它主要的力量是给予合作社以支持。在哈雷专区，拖拉机耕种的土地中，合作社占78％以上。这个比例，在全国也差不多。根据国家的规定，拖拉机站为合作社耕种的收费标准也比个体农民低20％；为常年互助组耕种的收费标准比个体农民低10％。
    在相近十年的生产实践中，拖拉机站的工作有了显著的改进。新布兰登堡区丢可夫拖拉机站的材料说明：从1951年到1956年，耕种面积由一万二千公顷增至三万五千公顷，每公顷耕作成本由六十九马克降至四十六马克，每个拖拉机手每年的产值由一万零四百马克增至一万八千四百马克。
    但是，目前拖拉机站最普遍的问题，仍然是成本过高，国家贴补很大。为了帮助我们具体了解这方面的情况，佩兹拖拉机站的会计主任毫无保留地从保险箱中拿出1956年的账簿来进行了精确的计算：去年一年中，这个拖拉机站的总收入为五十四万二千马克，总支出为一百六十一万马克，国家贴补一百零六万八千马克。丢可夫拖拉机站的情况比较好一些，去年国家还贴补了八十九万马克。而这些账目中，还不包括国家的建设投资。在1956年，为了增加全国拖拉机站的建筑和设备，国家共投资三亿三千一百万马克。
    拖拉机站的这种经营情况，被某些修正主义者加以夸大，并用作反对农业社会主义改造的借口。农业科学院的费维克教授，就是一个代表。他主张通过三个阶段来解散拖拉机站：一、将拖拉机站的机器，卖给执有现金的农民；二、剩余的机器由拖拉机站同农民成立合股公司，农民占50％的股分；三、合股公司的机器，用分期付款的办法逐步卖给农民股东。这个主张的实质，也就是取消社会主义在农村的支柱，让富裕中农和富农逐渐发展资本主义的农庄。
    费维克的反社会主义的言论遭到了广大劳动人民的反对。民主德国拖拉机站的工作人员和国家领导人员充满了信心要进一步地办好这个重要的社会主义事业。从1957年开始，已经在三十个拖拉机站中开始实行了经济核算制度。佩兹拖拉机站就是这三十个中的一个。这个拖拉机站的主任给我们仔细地分析了过去的情况和今后努力的方向。
    他说：我们赔在什么地方呢？因为我们耕每一公顷的土地，成本是四十至五十四马克，而只收二十到二十四马克的费用。成本高的原因是：一、合作社较少，个体的小块土地较多，耕种不合算。二、劳动力组织还不好，机器效率没有充分发挥。例如，有的拖拉机队，由于机器损坏或其它原因，每月停车时间仅仅三小时，而有的就达到了一百小时。
    但是——他说——我们完全有信心争取不赔本。我们的拖拉机站中，去年就有一个生产队的耕地成本已经降到每公顷二十九马克了。为了实行经济核算制，现在正展开按每小时计算劳动率的工作竞赛。这个竞赛一定会大大地刺激生产率的提高。
    争取不要国家贴补的运动，现在实际上已在全国范围内展开了。这个运动的中心内容是多耕地和少停车。穆肯伯尔格同志在回答我们的问题的时候说：拖拉机站要盈利，关键在于更好地利用机器。五年前，每一个标准马力的拖拉机，按中等深度计算，每年工作面积折算为一百六十公顷土地，1956年已达到了三百六十公顷，今年争取要达到三百八十公顷；在今后几年中，如果能达到五百公顷，这就可以使情况根本改变。
    他说：为了达到这个目的，必须继续使土地能够连成一片，并不断地加强劳动组织和劳动纪律。为此，国家正在研究改变拖拉机手的工资制度，使他们的工资根据单位面积产量的高低而定。
    最后，他肯定地告诉我们：“拖拉机站全部达到盈利，约需五年时间。”
