    The Forces of Peace Advance in Unity and Struggle
    Gu Si
    In the international events of the past two weeks, the most encouraging was the significant achievement of the 6th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival held in Moscow. At the same time, new developments have also taken place in the struggles concerning the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament, the German unification issue, and the Oman issue. All these events reflect the current basic situation: on the one hand, the forces of peace are growing stronger and fighting with full confidence; on the other hand, the imperialist forces, in an unfavorable position, are making every effort to counterattack against peace and maintain colonialism.

        The Great Significance of the Moscow Festival
    The unprecedented Moscow Youth Festival was a grand review of the forces of peace. 34,000 young men and women from 131 countries participated in this festival. The scale and enthusiasm of this festival exceeded any previous one. All the rich and varied activities held during the festival revolved around the central slogan of the festival: "For Peace and Friendship." This first of all shows that the unity of young people from all countries has been strengthened, and they are increasingly concerned about the cause of peace.
    The most important gain of the festival was that it greatly promoted mutual understanding and trust among young people from all countries, and increased their confidence and determination in the cause of striving for peace. The young people who attended came from various different countries and nationalities, and held various different political views. In extensive mutual contact and discussion, they eliminated many gaps between them, established friendly relations, and promoted a common understanding of many major issues. On the day the festival closed, they solemnly declared together: "Our will for peace is stronger than the atomic bomb. Our desire for happiness is unstoppable. We ourselves are more deeply aware of this than before."
    On August 6, the young people from all countries participating in the festival, together with the citizens of Moscow, held a peace demonstration of 500,000 people demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons. This large-scale demonstration echoed the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, which opened in Tokyo on the same day, demonstrating the strength of the forces of peace.
    The success of the festival was achieved in a sharp struggle with the imperialist forces. From the beginning of the preparation for this festival, the United States and some other Western countries tried their best to sabotage it. They spread a large number of rumors slandering the festival and took many measures to obstruct young people from Western countries from participating. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles ordered U.S. ambassadors stationed in NATO countries to prevent young people from going to Moscow. However, all these sabotage conspiracies failed shamefully. Young people from the United States and other Western countries formed fairly large delegations, broke through many obstacles, and participated in the festival. From this point, it can be seen that in today's situation, it is becoming more and more difficult for the United States to maintain the "iron curtain" between the people of Eastern and Western countries.

    Large-Scale Demonstrations by Forces Demanding the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
    In the current struggle to safeguard world peace and security, it is a very urgent task to strive for the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and the implementation of disarmament. In the London disarmament negotiations, the Soviet Union had already put forward specific proposals for an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons tests and a gradual implementation of comprehensive disarmament, providing a good basis for reaching an agreement. However, the Western countries have been adopting delaying tactics, making the five months of negotiations fruitless. This situation has aroused increasing dissatisfaction and opposition around the world. The Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, which just closed in Tokyo, is one of the concrete signs reflecting this strong desire of the people of the world.
    This conference had a very broad representation. There were 4,000 delegates from all walks of life in Japan, as well as representatives from 25 countries including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, India, and Egypt, and 10 important international organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions. In the months before the conference, a series of mass movements against hydrogen bombs had been launched throughout Japan. Parliaments at all levels had also passed resolutions against hydrogen bombs, and the whole country unanimously supported the conference.
    Compared with the previous two conferences, this conference clearly showed that the Japanese people's movement against nuclear weapons has become stronger than before and has received more powerful support from all over the world. Their struggle goals have also become clearer. The "Tokyo Declaration," appeal, and conference resolution unanimously adopted by the conference fully expressed the determination of the people of the world to oppose atomic warfare, demand the immediate signing of an international agreement to stop nuclear weapons tests, achieve comprehensive disarmament, and unconditionally prohibit nuclear weapons. The Japanese delegates also passed a resolution to vigorously promote the movement against nuclear weapons in Japan.
    The mood of the Tokyo Conference shows that if the United States and its followers are obsessed with continuing to obstruct disarmament and engage in the nuclear arms race, they will inevitably encounter stronger and more powerful opposition from the people of all countries.

    The Struggle Between Two Lines on the German Issue
    There have also been new developments in the issue of German unification recently.
    On July 27, Premier Grotewohl, on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic, issued a statement putting forward important proposals for the peaceful unification of Germany. The main spirit of this proposal is: First, the unification of Germany is a matter for the Germans themselves and should be resolved through consultations between East and West Germany. Second, considering the reality of the independent existence of the two Germanys, it is advocated that East and West Germany form a sovereign and independent confederation as a preliminary step towards unifying Germany. Third, it is proposed that the two Germanys first sign three agreements to create a foundation for the conclusion of a confederation. These agreements are: prohibiting the manufacture of atomic weapons and the propaganda of atomic warfare within Germany; withdrawing from the North Atlantic Treaty and the Warsaw Treaty respectively, abolishing conscription, and limiting the number of troops; and requesting the four major powers to withdraw their troops from all of Germany in the near future.
    These proposals of the German Democratic Republic proceed from reality and from the national interests of the entire German people and the interests of European security. It is the only correct path that can lead to the peaceful unification of Germany and make all of Germany a peace-loving country.
    However, the United States, Britain, France, and the Adenauer clique of West Germany insisted on their path of continuing to split Germany and leading West Germany to the disaster of war. The Adenauer clique rejected the proposals of the government of the German Democratic Republic without consideration. At the same time, the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany colluded together and issued a joint statement. In this joint statement, they still opposed the principle of resolving the German issue by the Germans themselves and insisted on external interference to "unify Germany." The so-called "unification" method is still the old conspiracy of holding so-called "free elections" under the control of foreign interference and the fascist forces of West Germany. The Western countries completely ignored the important peaceful proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic for East and West Germany to negotiate to avoid being involved in the atomic arms race, limiting East and West German armaments, withdrawing from military treaties, and withdrawing foreign troops. On the contrary, they proposed to retain the right for a "unified" Germany to continue to participate in the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to expand armaments and prepare for war without restriction. This statement shows that the aim of the Western countries is to block the door to the peaceful unification of Germany, so as to continue to maintain tension and turn West Germany into the main tool of aggression and the main atomic warfare base of the Western bloc.
    The struggle between these two different positions on the German issue has aroused serious concern from all parties in the world. A delegation of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union recently visited the German Democratic Republic, and the leaders of the two countries reached a complete consensus on major issues such as the European situation, disarmament, and the unification of Germany. The Soviet Union firmly supported the German Democratic Republic's proposal that the German issue be resolved through consultations between the two Germanys, and condemned the serious danger of Western countries attempting to turn West Germany into a hotbed of atomic warfare. The Soviet Union and Germany also unanimously stated that they would resolutely defend the independence of the German Democratic Republic and would not allow its borders to be violated. This solemn and clear position of the Soviet government is the most powerful encouragement to the German people who are striving for the peaceful unification of their motherland, and it is also a heavy blow to the Western countries' policy of playing with fire.

    Another Counterattack by Imperialist Forces in the Middle East
    Beginning in early August, British colonialists further adopted bloody repressive measures against the uprising of the Omani army and people. This is another frenzied counterattack by Western colonialists against the anti-colonial struggle of the people of Middle Eastern countries.
    This heroic uprising of the Omani people and the situation it has caused have further shaken the colonial countries' rule in the Middle East, and have also made the contradictions between the United States and Britain in their struggle for colonial interests more tense. Faced with this unfavorable situation, Dulles made a dirty political deal with Britain during his recent visit to London.
    The United States is still adopting its usual two-faced tactics. On the one hand, it is using the Oman issue to put pressure on Britain, forcing Britain to make more concessions to the United States in redividing colonial interests in the Middle East, especially oil rights. On the other hand, it is supporting Britain in intensifying its bloody repression of the Omani people, and demanding that Britain quickly "resolve" the Oman issue so as not to affect the overall situation. The colonialist face of the United States has been further exposed on this issue.
    In the face of a better-equipped enemy, the Omani insurgents have taken the initiative to withdraw from the capital, Nizwa, and retreat into the mountains to continue their resistance. However, the temporary military success of the British colonialists does not mean that they have won. The leadership of the Omani insurgents has announced that they are determined to fight a protracted war until they achieve final victory. At the same time, the bloody repression by Britain has greatly deepened the hatred of the people of Middle Eastern countries towards the colonialists. The Arab League countries have reunited on the Oman issue. Recently, they unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Oman issue be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for discussion, and called on the Bandung Conference countries to support the Omani people's anti-colonial struggle. The Security Council has decided to meet on the 20th of this month to discuss the Oman issue. Because of the wide disparity in armed forces between the insurgents and the colonialists, the struggle of the Omani people will inevitably be a long, arduous, and tortuous process. With the support of the people of Arab countries and the forces of peace all over the world behind them, the counterattack by Western colonialists can only end in failure.

### 和平力量在团结和斗争中前进

专栏：两周时事述评

    和平力量在团结和斗争中前进
    顾思
    在最近两周的国际事件中，最为振奋人心的，是在莫斯科举行的第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节所获得的重大成就。同时，在有关禁止核武器和裁军问题、德国统一问题和阿曼问题等方面的斗争，也都有新的发展。所有这些事件都反映了当前的基本形势：一方面是和平力量日益壮大和信心百倍地进行斗争；另方面是处于不利地位的帝国主义势力，正竭力进行反对和平和维护殖民主义的反扑。
        莫斯科联欢节的重大意义
    空前盛大的莫斯科青年联欢节，是和平力量的一次大检阅。参加这届联欢节的，有来自一百三十一个国家的男女青年三万四千人。这次联欢的规模之大，情绪之热烈，都超过了以往的任何一届。联欢节所举行的所有丰富多采的活动，都是围绕着联欢节的中心口号“争取和平和友谊”来进行的。这首先就说明：各国青年的团结加强了，他们对于和平事业越来越关心了。
    联欢节的重大收获，最主要的是大大促进了各国青年之间的相互了解和信任，增加了他们对于争取和平事业的信心和决心。到会青年来自各种不同的国家和民族，抱有各种不同的政治见解，在广泛的相互接触和讨论中，消除了他们之间的许多隔阂，建立了友谊关系，促进了对于许多重大问题的共同认识。在联欢节闭幕的那一天，他们庄严地共同宣布：“我们的和平意志比原子弹更强大。我们对幸福的愿望是不可抑制的。我们自己比以前更深刻地认识到这一点。”
    在8月6日，参加联欢节的各国青年并和莫斯科市民一道，举行了五十万人的要求禁止核武器的和平大示威。这个大示威和同一天在东京开幕的第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会遥相呼应，显示了和平力量的壮大声势。
    联欢节的成功，是在同帝国主义势力的尖锐斗争中取得的。从本届联欢节开始筹备的时候起，美国和其他一些西方国家就竭力进行破坏，它们撒布了大量的诽谤联欢节的谣言，采取了许多阻挠西方各国青年参加的措施。美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经向驻在北大西洋集团各国的美国大使下令，要求他们阻止青年到莫斯科去。但是，所有这些破坏阴谋都可耻地失败了，美国和其他西方国家的青年都组成了规模相当大的代表团，突破重重障碍参加了联欢。从这一点就可看出，在今天的形势下，美国还要在东西各国人民之间高挂“铁幕”，已经是难乎其难了。
    要求禁止核武器力量的大示威
    在当前维护世界和平和安全的斗争中，争取停止核武器试验、禁止核武器和实行裁军是十分迫切的课题。在伦敦裁军谈判中，苏联早就提出了立即停止核武器试验和逐步实行全面裁军的具体建议，为达成协议提供了良好的基础。但是，西方国家一直采取拖延策略，使得五个月的谈判一事无成。这种情况，在全世界引起了越来越大的不满和反对。刚在东京闭幕的第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，就是反映世界人民这一强烈愿望的具体标志之一。
    这届会议具有非常广泛的代表性，到会的有日本各界选派的四千名代表，还有来自中、苏、美、英、印度、埃及等二十五个国家和世界工联等十个重要国际组织的代表。在大会举行之前的好几个月中，日本全国各地曾经展开了一系列的反对氢弹的群众性运动，各级议会也纷纷通过反对氢弹的决议，举国一致地支持这届的大会。
    这届大会和过去的两届相比较，清楚地显示了日本人民反对核武器的运动已经比以前更加壮大，并且从全世界获得了更有力的支持。他们的斗争目标也更加明确了。大会一致通过的“东京宣言”、呼吁书和大会决议，都充分表示了全世界人民反对原子战争，要求立即签订停止核武器试验的国际协定，实现全面裁军和无条件禁止核武器的决心。日本代表并通过决议，在日本国内大力推进反对核武器的运动。
    东京大会的情绪说明，美国和它的追随者如果执迷不悟地要继续阻挠裁军和进行核子军备竞赛，它们必将遭到各国人民更强烈、更有力的反对。
    德国问题上两条路线的斗争
    德国统一问题最近也有了新的发展。
    7月27日，格罗提渥总理代表德意志民主共和国政府发表一项声明，提出了和平统一德国的重要建议。这个建议的主要精神是：一、统一德国是德国人自己的事，应当通过东西德的协商来求得解决。二、考虑到两个德国独立存在的现实情况，主张由东西德组成主权独立的联盟，来作为统一德国的初步步骤。三、建议两个德国首先签订三项协议，以便为缔结联盟创立基础，这些协议是：禁止在德国境内制造原子武器和宣传原子战争；分别退出北大西洋公约和华沙条约，取消兵役制和限制军队人数；要求四大国在不久的将来从全德国撤出自己的军队。
    民主德国的这些建议，是从现实出发，从全德人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益出发的。它是目前可以导致和平统一德国并使全德成为爱好和平的国家的唯一正确的道路。
    但是，美、英、法和西德的阿登纳集团，却坚持它的继续分裂德国和把西德引向战争灾难的道路。阿登纳集团不加考虑就拒绝了德意志民主共和国政府提出的主张。同时，美、英、法和西德勾结一起，发表了一项联合声明。在这个联合声明中，它们仍然反对由德国人自己解决德国问题的原则，坚持要由外力干涉来“统一德国”。而所谓“统一”的办法，还是在外国干预和西德法西斯势力控制下举行所谓“自由选举”那个老阴谋。对于民主德国提出的由东西德谈判来采取避免卷入原子军备竞赛、限制东西德军备、退出军事条约和撤退外国军队等等重要的和平主张，西方国家完全置之不理。相反地，它们提出要保留“统一”后的德国继续参加侵略性的北大西洋集团和无限制地扩军备战的权利。这个声明，表明了西方国家的目的是要堵死和平统一德国的大门，以便继续保持紧张局势，并把西德变成西方集团的主要侵略工具和主要的原子战争基地。
    在德国问题上这两种不同立场的斗争，已引起世界各方的严重关注。苏联共产党和政府代表团在最近访问了民主德国，两国领导人对于欧洲局势、裁减军备和统一德国等重大问题，取得了完全一致的意见。苏联坚决支持民主德国提出的由两个德国协商解决德国问题的主张，并且谴责了西方国家企图把西德变成原子战争温床的严重危险。苏德两国并一致表示，它们将坚决保卫民主德国的独立，不许侵犯它的边境。苏联政府这种严正的、明确的立场，是对于争取和平统一祖国的德国人民的最有力的鼓舞，也是对于西方国家的玩火政策的一个沉重的打击。
    帝国主义势力在中东的又一反扑
    8月初旬开始，英国殖民者对起义的阿曼军民进一步采取了血腥的镇压措施。这是西方殖民者对中东各国人民反殖民主义斗争的又一个疯狂的反扑。
    阿曼人民这次英勇的起义及其所引起的局势，进一步动摇了殖民国家在中东的统治地位，并且也使美英两国争夺殖民利益的矛盾更加紧张。面对这种不利局面，杜勒斯最近访问伦敦时曾和英国做了一桩肮脏的政治买卖。
    美国所采取的仍然是它一贯使用的两面手法。一方面，它利用阿曼问题对英国施加压力，迫使英国在重分中东的殖民利益、特别是石油权益方面向美国作更多的让步，另一面则支持英国对阿曼人民加紧采取血腥镇压，并且要求英国迅速“解决”阿曼问题，以免牵动大局。美国的殖民主义面目，在这个问题上又进一步暴露出来了。
    在优势装备的敌人面前，阿曼起义者已主动撤出首都尼兹瓦，退入山区继续抵抗。但是，英国殖民者军事上的一时得逞，却决不是说明它已取得胜利。阿曼起义者的领导方面已宣布，他们决心长期抗战，直到取得最后胜利为止。同时，英国的血腥镇压，也大大加深了中东各国人民对殖民主义者的仇恨。阿拉伯联盟各国已经在阿曼问题上重新团结起来了，最近它们一致地通过决议，要求把阿曼问题提交联合国安理会讨论，同时呼吁万隆会议国家支持阿曼人民的反殖民主义斗争，安理会并已决定在本月20日开会讨论阿曼问题。由于起义者和殖民者在武装力量方面相去悬殊，阿曼人民的斗争必将是一个长期的、艰苦的、曲折的过程。他们的背后有着阿拉伯各国人民和全世界和平力量的支持，西方殖民主义者的反扑，最后只能以失败而告终。
