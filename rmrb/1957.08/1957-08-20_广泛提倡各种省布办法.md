Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are using various methods to save cotton cloth for the country.

The PLA's Quartermaster Department has done a very good job this year in recycling worn-out clothing and cotton. It is estimated that the worn-out clothing recycled this year can be converted into 340,000 bolts of cotton cloth, and more than 5.33 million jin of cotton. These recycled old cloth and cotton will be fully utilized in the production of new bedding. In addition, the Quartermaster Department has also adopted methods of appropriately extending the service life of clothing and strictly controlling the use of cloth to save cotton cloth for the country.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are also actively thinking of ways to save personal cloth consumption and return the saved cloth coupons to the state. Since May, cloth coupons turned over to the state by only fourteen regions and the Quartermaster Department's military service department and other units have amounted to nearly 6.5 million chi.

Central and Beijing Municipal Agencies
Have Saved More Than Five Million Chi of Cotton Cloth This Year
Xinhua News Agency, 19th: So far this year, central-level and Beijing municipal agencies have saved 5.08 million city chi of cotton cloth, and the actual amount of cloth used is much less than the original plan. This is according to the latest statistics from the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Textile Products Company.

The Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Geology, etc., are agencies that require a relatively large amount of public cotton cloth, and the amount of cotton cloth used this year is less than last year. More than 300 units under these departments needed more than 600,000 meters of business cloth in the second quarter, but the actual amount of cotton cloth used was only more than 120,000 meters. More than 100 hospitals and sanatoriums under the central government and Beijing municipality generally reduced the use of equipment cloth in the second quarter by more than half compared with the plan.

When formulating cloth consumption plans, these agencies repeatedly calculated meticulously, and anything that could be done without cotton cloth was not used at all; if it could be used less, it was used less. This year, the Ministry of Commerce not only did not buy an inch of public cloth, but also cleaned up the warehouse and turned over the stock of cotton cloth, bedding, and sheets to the Beijing State-owned Textile Products Company for transfer to other units.

The staff of the Beijing Textile Products Company has also done a lot of work in saving cotton cloth. They helped cloth-using units to calculate meticulously, calculate the amount of materials used, find substitutes for cloth-using units, and also sent special personnel to various units to understand the situation and suggest that cloth-using units use lower-quality cloth as much as possible according to actual needs. Just the item of helping various agencies save cloth for work clothes, they saved more than 153,000 chi of cotton cloth in May this year.

Return the Surplus Cloth Coupons to the State
Wuhan Turned Over More Than 93,000 Chi of Second-Term Cloth Coupons
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th: The people of Wuhan carefully calculated and saved cotton cloth, and by the end of July, they turned over more than 93,000 chi of the second-term cloth coupons to the state.

In saving cotton cloth, many cadres, workers, and residents voluntarily did not receive or received less cloth coupons. For example, among the 116 employees of the wholesale store of the Municipal Knitting and Cotton Products Company, 91 employees received less or did not receive 2,250 chi of cloth coupons. After careful calculation, the employees of the Second Warehouse of the Provincial Native Produce Export Company turned over more than 60% of the cloth coupons that should have been received. Residents of Dajia Street in Hankou saved more than 600 chi of cloth coupons and turned them over to the state.

Many enterprises also received less public cloth in accordance with the spirit of thrift. The Wuhan Public Automobile Company originally planned to issue more than 1,700 sets of work clothes, but now only issues them to internal staff, technicians, and apprentices who work under the car all day long, thus saving more than 1,200 sets of work clothes.

Shenyang Takes Various Measures
To Reduce Industrial Cloth Consumption
Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th: In the first half of this year, the consumption of public cloth and industrial production cloth in Shenyang decreased by more than 30.09 million chi compared with the same period last year, which was more than 3.07 million chi less than the plan for the first half of this year.

The leadership of many agencies and enterprises has attached great importance to the work of saving cotton cloth this year. For example, according to the past cloth consumption situation, the Materials General Factory of the Shenyang Railway Administration once proposed a plan to use more than 1.1 million chi of cloth in the first half of the year. After the leadership of the Shenyang Railway Administration re-examined it, it was determined to generally extend the wearing period of work clothes by one quarter. As long as they can still be worn, they should be repaired and worn. As a result, only more than 110,000 chi of cloth were used in the first half of the year. The Shenyang Reclaimed Rubber Factory produces tire repair tape. The isolation cloth in the middle of the repair tape used to be entirely new white cloth. Now, it is replaced with wrap cloth and old cloth, saving more than 45,000 chi of cotton cloth in half a year.

Many Industries in Ningbo
Recycle Old Cloth to Save Clothing Materials
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 19th: In the past four months, many industries in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, have saved 300,000 meters of cotton cloth by adopting methods such as recycling old cloth. The grain company recovered flour bags for reuse, which reduced the purchase of 90,000 meters of cotton cloth. The sewing industry promoted advanced cloth-saving cutting techniques, and the tailors of more than 380 sewing cooperatives have generally learned it. (Attached picture)

    广泛提倡各种省布办法
    回收破旧服装　节约个人用布
    解放军节省大量棉布
    据新华社19日讯　中国人民解放军广大部队官兵用多种方法为国家节省棉布。
    解放军军需部门今年回收破旧服装和棉花的工作做得很好，预计今年回收的破旧服装可以折合棉布三十四万匹，棉花有五百三十三万多斤。这些回收的旧布和棉花将在制作新被服时充分加以利用。另外，军需部门还采用了适当延长服装使用年限和严格控制用布的办法，来为国家节省棉布。
    解放军广大官兵还积极想办法节省个人用布，并把节约下来的布票缴还国家。从5月份以来，仅十四个地区和军需部军人服务处等单位上缴给国家的布票就将近六百五十万尺。
    中央和北京市各机关
    今年已节约棉布五百多万尺
    据新华社19日讯　到现在为止，今年中央一级和北京市各机关节约了五百零八万市尺棉布，实际用布量比原订计划少得多。这是中国纺织品公司北京市公司最近统计出来的。
    文化部、交通部和地质部等是需要公用棉布较多的机关，今年用的棉布都比去年为少。这些部门所属的三百多个单位，在第二季度需要的业务用布是六十多万公尺，实际用的棉布只有十二万多公尺。中央和北京市所属的一百多个医院、疗养院，第二季度使用的设备用布，普遍比计划减少一半以上。
    这些机关在制定用布计划的时候，都反复算了细账，凡是可以不用棉布的，一律不用；可以少用的，一概少用。今年商业部不仅没有买一寸公用布，而且清理了仓库，把库存的棉布、被褥和床单等，缴回北京市国营纺织品公司，转交其他单位使用。
    北京市纺织品公司的工作人员在节约棉布方面也做了许多工作，他们帮助用布单位算细账，计算用料，替用布单位找代用品，还派出专人到各单位了解情况，建议用布单位根据实际需要，尽量使用质量较差的布。光是他们帮助各机关节约工作服用布这一项，今年5月份就节约了十五万三千多尺棉布。
    把节余的布票退给国家
    武汉市上缴第二期布票九万三千多尺
    据新华社武汉19日电　武汉市人民精打细算节约棉布，到7月底止，上缴给国家的第二期布票达九万三千多尺。
    在节约棉布中，有许多干部、职工和居民自愿不领或少领布票，如市针棉织品公司批发商店一百一十六个职工中，有九十一人少领或未领布票二千二百五十尺。省土产出口公司第二仓库职工经过精打细算，上缴的布票占应领布票的60％以上。汉口大夹街的居民节约了六百多尺布票上缴给国家。
    许多企业也根据节约的精神，少领了公用布。武汉市公用汽车公司原计划要发工作服一千七百多套，现在仅发给整天在汽车下面工作的内勤、技工和学徒，这样便节约了一千二百多套工作服。
    沈阳采取各种措施
    减少工业用布
    据新华社沈阳19日电　沈阳市今年上半年公共用布和工业生产用布的消费量，比去年同时期减少三千零九十多万尺。比今年上半年的计划少用三百零七万多尺。
    很多机关、企业的领导方面今年都很重视节约棉布的工作。例如：沈阳铁路管理局材料总厂依照过去用布的情况，上半年曾提出用布一百一十多万尺的计划，经沈阳铁路管理局领导方面重新审查以后，确定把工作服穿用期一般延长一个季度，只要还能穿用的一律加以修补后穿用，结果上半年只用了十一万多尺布。沈阳再生胶厂生产车轮补带胶，补带胶中间的隔离布，过去完全是用新白布，现在改用包皮布和旧布，半年中就节省了四万五千多尺棉布。
    宁波许多行业
    回收旧布　节省衣料
    据新华社杭州19日电　浙江省宁波市许多行业最近四个月来采用回收旧布等办法，节约了棉布三十万公尺。粮食公司收回面粉袋重用，就少买了九万公尺棉布。缝纫业中推广省料的先进裁剪技术，三百八十多个缝纫合作社的裁剪师已经普遍学会。（附图片）
