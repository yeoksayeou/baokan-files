I am willing to dedicate my life to defend the socialist cause
Tianjin University Student Cai Guoying

My hometown, Nansanjiang Village in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, was as dark as hell before liberation. My family's life got worse every year.

The difficult life made me no longer dare to dream of studying. At the age of sixteen, I went to Shanghai.

When I first entered the factory in Shanghai, I was an apprentice, and it was stipulated that I would only be provided with food for three to six months without wages. I couldn't leave casually within three years, otherwise I would have to pay two dan of white rice.

In summer, we ate sour food every meal, and the food was not even as good as what pigs ate. When eating, someone was specially assigned to watch, saying that this person ate too much, that person ate too little, grumbling. We were so angry that we didn't want to eat, and we all became pale and emaciated.

Where we lived, it was sunny outside in summer, and it was also sunny inside, and it rained outside, and it also rained inside. In the workshop, it rained heavily outside, and there was a flood inside. We worked barefoot, standing in the water all day long.

At that time, there was no freedom to speak of. The apprentices' dormitory was in the factory. After work, they could only stay in their own rooms and could not go to other people's rooms. The factory specially sent people to watch. We were only allowed to go out once a week, and we had to ask them for a note first. We had to be searched when we left the factory. That was how the workers' personality was insulted.

We started work at six in the morning and finished at six in the evening. "Six in, six out." On Sundays, we generally had to work sixteen to eighteen hours, and some even had to work twenty hours.

Wages were paid twice a month, on the 3rd and 15th. The capitalists settled the accounts as early as the 1st of the month, but prices changed every day at that time. If it was paid on the 1st, we could still buy two or three dou of rice, but by the 15th, it was useless. I remember once that my half-month's salary only bought a bar of soap.

In the workshop, the foremen abused the workers at will. Once, a female worker was almost pushed onto the conveyor belt and killed. The "Number One" foremen often used copper tubes for spinning to beat workers for some trivial matters. Therefore, people often went to work fine, but came out with bumps on their heads after work.

When we could no longer bear it, we didn't go to work. I gave the "Number One" foremen and the factory director my opinion, asking them not to abuse us like this. That was after Wang Xiaohuo was shot in Shanghai. The capitalists' agent said, "Good! You still want to strike. Wang Xiaohuo is your example."

In the summer of 1949, our area was liberated, and everyone was unspeakably happy. The old female workers happily sang, "The sky in the liberated area is a bright sky. The people in the liberated area are so happy..." Soon we also overthrew the foremen. Two or three "Number One" foremen lost their freedom, but all seven hundred workers in the factory gained freedom.

One night in 1952, I was on the night shift when I received a notice to study at the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School. I was extremely happy. What I dared not imagine before liberation, what I had been looking forward to for many years, finally came true. The Party told me that not only would it send me to the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School, but it would also send me to university in the future. Now all of these have been fully realized.

The rightist elements are telling lies with their eyes closed. If you don't believe it, it's best to come to our school and ask a few classmates from worker backgrounds to investigate and see what kind of life we used to live and what kind of life we are living now.

In 1953, I went home once, and the village had changed a lot. The houses that were burned down by the Japanese devils had not been rebuilt before liberation. After liberation, mutual aid teams were organized, and labor was exchanged to help each other, and those houses were rebuilt.

Now, my family has joined the cooperative. My father raised a pig, preparing to eat it for the New Year. Before liberation, we could only eat bean dregs for the New Year. Now we don't have to worry about food or clothing, and we can even slaughter a pig for the New Year. What a big change. Whether life was better before liberation or after liberation, the vast number of peasants know very clearly.

Is the current freedom the freedom in a goldfish bowl? The rightist elements are trying their best to provoke the relationship between the Party and the people, but the working people themselves are the clearest. Personal experience has given me a deep understanding of freedom. Now it is truly freedom. The workers and peasants who have been liberated无比地love the Party and love today's happy and beautiful life. The rightist elements overestimate themselves, attempting to carry out capitalist restoration, oppose the socialist cause, and oppose the leadership of the Party. The workers and peasants absolutely will not allow it. They can no longer endure the painful life of the past. Having stood up, they will use everything they have to defend their happy life.

I personally experienced the old society. I hate the dark and autocratic old society, where I toiled all day but could not make a living; I无比地love the brilliant and infinitely promising new society. I sternly warn the reactionary elements that whoever dares to oppose the sacred cause of socialism, I will fight them to the end. In order to defend the sacred socialist cause that millions of martyrs shed blood and sacrificed for, I am willing to dedicate my young life!

### 为了保卫社会主义事业  不惜献出我的生命

    为了保卫社会主义事业
    不惜献出我的生命
    天津大学学生　蔡国英
    我的家乡——浙江诸暨县南三江村，解放前一直就像地狱一样的黑暗。家里的生活一年不如一年。
    生活困难，使我再也不敢作念书的美梦了。十六岁时，我到上海去了。
    到上海后，我一进厂是养成工，规定了三月到六月内只供伙食，没有工资。不满三年不能随便走的，不然就要拿出两担白米。
    夏天顿顿吃馊饭，菜还没有猪吃的好。吃饭时，专门有人看管，说这个吃多了，那个吃少了，叽叽咕咕。气得我们都不想吃了，一个个面黄肌瘦。
    住的地方，夏天外面是太阳，里面也是太阳，外面下雨，里面也下雨。车间里，外面下大雨，里面发大水，我们赤着脚，整天站在水里工作。
    那时，自由是根本谈不上的，养成工的宿舍在厂里，下了工只能待在自己的屋里，不能到别人的屋里去，厂里专门派人看着。一星期只准出去一次，先得求他们开个条子，出厂时还得抄身，工人的人格就是这样的被侮辱。
    早上六点上工，晚上六点下工。“六进六出”，星期日一般要工作十六到十八小时，有的还要工作二十小时。
    工资一个月发两次，三号，十五号。本来是十五号发工资，资本家早在一号就结好账，那时物价一天一个行市。一号发，本来还可买两三斗米，可是等到十五号就一点不顶用了。记得我有一次半个月的工资只买了一块肥皂。
    在车间里，工头随便欺侮工人，有一次一个女工差一点被推到皮带上要了命。拿摩温工头为了一些小事，时常用落纱用的铜管打工人。因此时常有人上工时好好地进去，下工时头上带着大疙瘩出来。
    实在忍无可忍，我们就没有上工。我给拿摩温和厂长提意见，不要这样欺侮我们。那时正是上海王孝和被枪杀以后。资本家的代理人说，好！你们还想罢工，王孝和就是你们的榜样。
    1949年夏天，我们那里解放了，大家心里有说不出的高兴。老年女工高兴地唱着：“解放区的天，是明朗的天。解放区的人民，好喜欢……”。不久我们又斗倒了工头，两三个拿摩温失去了自由，可是全厂七百工人得到了自由。
    1952年一天夜里，我正值夜班，接到去工农速成中学学习的通知，我真高兴极了。解放前，我不敢想像的事，多少年来我一直盼望的事，终于实现了。党告诉我，不但要送我进工农速中，将来还要送我进大学。现在这些都完全实现了。
    右派分子闭着眼睛说瞎话，若不信，最好到我们学校来，找几位工人出身的同学好好调查调查，看看我们过去过的什么日子，现在又是什么样的日子。
    1953年我回家一次，村子里变化很大。被日本鬼子烧掉的房子，解放前一直没有盖起来。解放后，组织了互助组，变工互助，那些房子都重新盖起来了。
    现在，我家参加了合作社，父亲喂了一口猪，准备过年吃。解放前，过年只能吃豆渣，现在生活不愁吃、不愁穿，而且过年还能杀一口猪，变化多大呵。到底是解放前生活好，还是解放后生活好，广大的农民，是知道得清清楚楚的。
    现在的自由是金鱼缸中的自由吗？右派分子极力挑拨党和人民的关系，但是劳动人民自己是最清楚的。亲身的经验使我对于自由有深刻的体会，现在真是自由。获得了解放的工人农民，他们无比地热爱党，热爱今天的幸福，美好的生活。右派分子自不量力，企图进行资本主义的复辟，反对社会主义事业，反对党的领导。工农是绝对不允许的，他们再也不能忍受过去惨痛的生活，站起来了的他们，将用自己的一切保卫幸福的生活。
    我是从旧社会亲身经历过来的，我恨死了黑暗、专制，终日辛勤劳动，但无法生活的旧社会；我无比地热爱光辉灿烂，前途无限美好的新社会。我严厉地警告反动分子，谁胆敢反对社会主义的神圣事业，我就要和他斗争到底，为了捍卫神圣的千百万烈士流血牺牲换来的社会主义事业，我不惜献出我年青的生命！
