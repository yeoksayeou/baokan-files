Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, August 29th: European People's Democratic countries' newspapers and radio stations have commented on the TASS statement regarding the successful Soviet test of an intercontinental ballistic rocket.

　　The Polish "People's Tribune" wrote that the fact that the Soviet rocket can reach remote areas on Earth shows that the Soviet Union has made a huge leap in this regard. Whether from the perspective of the armed forces or from a technical point of view, the Soviet Union is not inferior to the United States, and in some respects undoubtedly surpasses it.

　　Prague Radio, in its commentary, emphasized that the Soviet Union, possessing various modern nuclear weapons and intercontinental rocket weapons, will continue to strive for an agreement on the cessation of testing and prohibition of atomic weapons, as well as the entire disarmament issue, for the sake of the safety and peace of the world's people. This goal would have been achieved long ago if it were not for the obstacles created by Western countries.

　　Berlin's democratic newspapers pointed out that the successful testing of the Soviet-made rocket is of great significance for the further development of science and for strengthening the defense capabilities of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp.

　　The Hungarian "People's Will" wrote in its commentary that after achieving outstanding technological achievements, the Soviet Union reiterated its specific proposals for disarmament. The country that possesses intercontinental rockets once again declared that a disarmament agreement should be reached as soon as possible.

　　The Romanian "Labor Daily" said that the successful launch of the intercontinental ballistic rocket and the hydrogen weapon powerfully demonstrated the Soviet Union's power and its defense capabilities. These tests convincingly prove the high level of Soviet scientists and technicians.

　　"Free Romania" said that the Soviet Union's development of an intercontinental rocket capable of reaching any region on Earth disrupted the United States' military strategy. The newspaper emphasized that the Western aggressive bloc has suffered a heavy blow.

　　The Bulgarian "Workers' Affairs" newspaper's editorial wrote that the Soviet Union is a consistently loyal defender of peace. Its armed forces serve the cause of peace wholeheartedly. Therefore, the strengthening of the Soviet army's strength makes everyone who truly cherishes the cause of peace happy.

　　According to a New Delhi report, Indian newspapers reported that Prime Minister Nehru, commenting on the Soviet Union's announcement of the successful testing of an intercontinental ballistic rocket at the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Advisory Committee on the 28th, expressed the hope that the emergence of this new weapon might have a sobering effect on the current disarmament talks in London. He emphasized the need to reach an agreement on disarmament immediately.

　　On the same day, all central-level newspapers in India and most newspapers in Cairo prominently published the news of the successful Soviet intercontinental ballistic rocket test. Many newspapers pointed out that the Soviet Union was the first country to successfully test this weapon, that the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the United States in this regard, and emphasized that the most important thing at present is to make disarmament negotiations successful.
