    The famous grain-producing province of Hunan has reaped a bumper harvest of early rice on over 12 million mu of land. In the Dongting Lake area, the average yield of early rice in each county is over 400 jin per mu, with some reaching 600-700 jin. This is a scene of members of the Yixinqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Yiyang County carrying surplus grain to the county grain company to sell to the state.
