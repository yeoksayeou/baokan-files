Xinhua News Agency, August 26th—Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Eighth Office of the State Council, made a statement on the comprehensive launch of the rectification movement in the industrial and commercial sector, as follows:

Our country is currently undergoing a great socialist revolutionary movement on the political and ideological fronts. This revolutionary movement is being carried out in the form of a nationwide debate, the central issue being to distinguish which is superior and which is inferior between the two paths of capitalism and socialism, and where to go from here. The movement is now being extended to every class and stratum. The anti-rightist struggle in the industrial and commercial sector has been going on for some time. Recently, the leading personnel of the industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai and Tianjin have agreed to our suggestion and are preparing to launch a comprehensive rectification movement. The Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce are about to hold a joint meeting to discuss the rectification issue for the national industrial and commercial sector. We believe that it is absolutely necessary and of great significance to comprehensively launch a rectification movement, including the anti-rightist struggle, in the national industrial and commercial sector.

The Left, Center, and Right Factions in the Industrial and Commercial Sector

Leftists have firmly established their socialist stance; rightists attempt to restore capitalism; the majority of centrists possess varying degrees of duality.

After the high tide of socialist transformation in 1956, capitalist industry and commerce implemented joint state-private ownership across the entire industry, basically achieving the transformation from capitalist ownership of the means of production to socialist ownership. This enabled the bourgeoisie to begin to transform their socio-economic status from exploiters to laborers, allowing them to take an important step on the road of accepting socialist transformation. However, apart from a few leftists in the industrial and commercial sector who have politically firmly established their socialist stance, that is, the stance of the working class, resolutely supporting the leadership of the Communist Party and resolutely taking the socialist road, the majority have not made the necessary transformations to their own political stance and thinking along with the changes in their socio-economic status. A small number of them still resist transformation, adhere to the capitalist stance, and attempt to restore capitalism. This small number of people who resist transformation and adhere to the capitalist stance are the rightists. They oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose taking the socialist road. The extreme rightists have great ambitions, not only holding reactionary views but also launching frenzied attacks on the Party, the people, and socialism. The largest part of the industrial and commercial sector is composed of centrists, whose characteristic is that they possess varying degrees of duality in their political stance. On the one hand, they tend to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and take the socialist road to varying degrees. However, on the other hand, they have basically not abandoned the capitalist stance and are not reconciled or convinced about handing over their enterprises, about socialism, about the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and still have nostalgia for capitalism. We say that centrists possess varying degrees of duality because this stratum's political attitude exhibits several different situations: a small number of people are relatively close to the left, some are relatively close to the right, and others waver between the two. The duality of the centrists causes them to constantly sway between the influences of the left and right factions. From the aspect that they tend to accept the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party to varying degrees, the centrists have already taken the first step on the long road from the capitalist stance to the socialist stance and may continue to accept and complete socialist transformation under the leadership of the Communist Party. However, on the other hand, the fact that they still maintain the capitalist stance to varying degrees is a path leading to the right, which makes the centrists themselves a target for rightists to win over and co-opt, allowing rightists to maintain their political influence in the industrial and commercial sector. Some time ago, due to the fact that the rightists' frenzied attacks had not yet met with counterattacks, the political attitudes of a considerable number of centrists, especially those leaning towards the right, underwent significant wavering and right-leaning under the deception and instigation of the rightists. Only after the anti-rightist struggle was launched did they gradually wake up, and many people gradually transformed to the left with the development and deepening of the struggle. However, even up to now, there are still some people who have not freed themselves from the influence of the rightists.

Here, it must be pointed out that the status of the capitalist economy before and after the socialist revolution in our country has an essential difference. Before the socialist revolution, the capitalist economy had both a positive side that was beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and a negative side that was detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the policy of the People's Government towards capitalism was to utilize its positive aspects, limit its negative aspects, and gradually transform it into a socialist economy. After this transformation has been basically completed, after the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory in terms of the ownership of the means of production, the capitalist economy no longer has any positive aspects. Under such circumstances, if people continue to adhere to the capitalist stance and attempt to restore the capitalist economy, that is an attempt to reverse history, and that is a reactionary stance.

At present, there are still a considerable number of individual handicrafts and individual small businesses in our country, but these economic components are generally led by the socialist economy and do not belong to the capitalist scope. Our free market is also under state management and is a supplement to the socialist organized market. Under special conditions, if the government deems it necessary, it may also allow the existence of certain scattered and small capitalist enterprises that fully comply with government laws and regulations, but this is an exception and requires individual review and approval. As for illegal capitalists and other speculators who violate government laws and regulations, privately recruit workers, use deceptive and theft methods to seize raw materials, organize underground factories, organize black markets, and engage in speculative buying and selling and other activities that undermine the socialist economy, the government must strictly ban them.

Which Road to Take?

In politics and ideology, the industrial and commercial sector still faces the serious question of which road to take: capitalism or socialism. Either follow the rightists to the dead end of counter-revolution, or follow the Communist Party wholeheartedly on the socialist road.

In today's social conditions, the capitalist stance is not only anti-socialist but also incompatible with the stance of patriotism; some people think that standing on the capitalist stance today is still patriotic, which is a complete fallacy. Our country has now become a socialist country and is thriving on the road of socialist construction, increasingly changing the original economic and cultural backwardness, which is something that any patriot feels happy and encouraged by. To love such a country, one must inevitably love socialism, accept the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and inevitably negate the capitalist stance. Because adhering to the capitalist stance means realizing capitalist restoration in our country, opposing socialism, opposing the Communist Party, and dragging China back to the colonial road. Will people who adhere to such a reactionary stance still love the socialist motherland? Of course, it is absolutely impossible. Under today's conditions, anyone who truly loves the country must negate the capitalist stance and stand on the socialist stance.

It can be seen that, politically and ideologically, the industrial and commercial sector still faces a serious question of which road to take: capitalism or socialism. Either follow the rightists and be led by them to the dead end of counter-revolution—the people of the whole country will never allow and never hope that industrialists and businessmen will embark on this dead end; or follow the Communist Party wholeheartedly, not half-heartedly, take the socialist road, continue to advance, and obtain a bright future. This requires resolutely struggling against the rightists and striving to change one's own political stance and truly turn to the side of socialism. For this purpose, the industrial and commercial sector must comprehensively launch a rectification movement with the educational content of opposing rightists, breaking the capitalist stance, and establishing the socialist stance.

Central Topics for Debate

The superiority of the socialist system; the reactionary nature of the capitalist economy and the capitalist stance; the duality of the bourgeoisie at present; continuing to accept socialist transformation; accepting the leadership of the Communist Party; relations with workers; the system of public representatives.

In order to make the rectification movement in the industrial and commercial sector a vivid and profound socialist education for the vast number of industrialists and businessmen, it is necessary to conduct debates on major issues of right and wrong related to the two paths. According to the six criteria proposed by Chairman Mao in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," combined with the current characteristics of the industrial and commercial sector, we believe that the following issues can be used as central topics for debate: First, the superiority of the socialist system; Second, the reactionary nature of the capitalist economy and the capitalist stance; Third, the duality of the bourgeoisie at present; Fourth, the issue of continuing to accept socialist transformation; Fifth, the issue of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party; Sixth, the issue of relations with workers; Seventh, the issue of the system of public representatives in joint state-private enterprises; and so on. Various localities can propose issues that must be debated according to local conditions.

What should be paid attention to in the anti-rightist struggle in the industrial and commercial sector in the future? This depends on the development of the struggle. Generally speaking, to defeat the rightists, one must be determined and thoroughly oppose them. To be determined, one must first overcome right-leaning viewpoints and sentimentalism, so as not to allow rightists to obtain a safe haven. The so-called thorough opposition is to adhere to the method of presenting facts and reasoning, and thoroughly expose and deeply criticize the reactionary words and deeds of the rightists. In this way, the rightists will be isolated; when they are isolated, they have the possibility of accepting transformation again. When exposing the rightists, in order to clarify the ins and outs of their reactionary words and deeds, their historical roots will be traced. This does not mean that people's history should generally be investigated, but only because the rightists frenziedly attack the Party and socialism, and at the same time, they are good at playing two-faced tactics, portraying themselves as lotuses that are untainted by the mud, so people have to dig out the old dirt of these rightists in order to clarify the truth. When struggling against the rightists, one should prevent and correct crude and simplistic methods, because this is not conducive to defeating the rightists or educating the masses. Rightists should be allowed to participate in the debate, because this is more conducive to distinguishing right from wrong and friend from foe, and more conducive to exposing the reactionary features of the rightists.

Arrangements for the Rectification Movement

Thoroughly carry out the anti-rightist struggle among key members, then carry out rectification; in general capitalists, the anti-rightist struggle should be handled differently according to different situations; in small industrialists and businessmen, socialist education should be carried out immediately; in minority areas, the industrialists and businessmen who have implemented socialist transformation can carry out rectification according to the specific situation.

How should the rectification movement be arranged in the industrial and commercial sector in various localities? In principle, different requirements and methods should be adopted according to the different situations of industrialists and businessmen.

(1) Among the key members of the industrial and commercial sector, including all members of China Democratic National Construction Association, members of All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce at all levels, members of trade associations, and working cadres of China Democratic National Construction Association and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, a thorough anti-rightist struggle should be carried out, and then a general rectification should be carried out on the basis of the victory of the anti-rightist struggle. The general rectification should be based on the six criteria proposed by Chairman Mao, combined with the above-mentioned central topics and the experience of the anti-rightist struggle, to carry out in-depth study and criticism, self-criticism. In accordance with the formula of unity—criticism—unity, adopt the method of gentle breeze and fine rain, free debate, mutual assistance, and common progress, rather than adopting the method of everyone checking their performance. (2) Among capitalists and capitalist agents other than the key members of the industrial and commercial sector, in principle, an anti-rightist struggle should also be carried out, but it can be handled differently according to the size of the city and the number of people. In smaller cities with fewer people, the anti-rightist struggle can be carried out together with the above-mentioned key members. In large cities with too many people, it is generally impossible for general capitalists and capitalist agents to carry out the anti-rightist struggle together with the above-mentioned key members. In this case, Shanghai and Tianjin intend to first carry out and deepen the anti-rightist struggle among the above-mentioned key members, and then decide whether to carry out the anti-rightist struggle among them. However, anti-rightist struggle education should be carried out now. This arrangement in Shanghai and Tianjin can be used as a reference for other large cities. (3) In small industrialists and businessmen, an anti-rightist struggle can generally not be carried out, but they must be repeatedly given popular education on opposing rightists, breaking the capitalist stance, and establishing the socialist stance, so that every household knows about it. This education must be started immediately. It is hoped that various localities will refer to the situation and experience of the national and local anti-rightist struggles, compile popular propaganda materials, and cultivate and train propagandists who can make popular reports. (4) In minority areas, industrialists and businessmen who have implemented socialist transformation can carry out the rectification movement. The arrangements, steps, and methods of the rectification movement, as well as whether to carry out the anti-rightist struggle, can be handled according to the specific conditions of each autonomous region and ethnic area.

The rectification movement in the industrial and commercial sector, under the leadership of the Party, can be jointly carried out by China Democratic National Construction Association (in places where there are China Democratic National Construction Association organizations) and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. This is a self-transformation work of historical significance and grand scale in the industrial and commercial sector, and it is also an extremely glorious task of China Democratic National Construction Association and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce at present. It is hoped that China Democratic National Construction Association and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will successfully complete this glorious task under the leadership and assistance of the Party.

Now, although the rectification movement in the industrial and commercial sector still needs to be further developed and deepened, with the development of the anti-rightist struggle, the rightists in the industrial and commercial sector have begun to disintegrate, and the attitude of the centrists, who occupy the majority position, has increasingly turned to the left. If we can make this great movement smoothly popularize and penetrate into the industrial and commercial sector, we can achieve the goals of consolidating and expanding the left, winning over and educating the centrists, and striking, isolating, and disintegrating the rightists. Especially the centrists, after this profound education, in addition to some who stop moving forward or even turn to the right, the majority may take a big step to the left, laying a favorable foundation for continuing to accept socialist transformation politically and ideologically in the future. In the industrial and commercial sector, besides the rightists with ulterior motives, who else does not want to complete socialist transformation smoothly? However, to achieve this goal, the facts make it clear that it is necessary to further solve the issue of political stance and ideological issues after the capitalist ownership of the means of production has been changed. For the majority of industrialists and businessmen who welcomed the joint state-private ownership of enterprises with gongs and drums last year, we have no reason not to believe that they can take another step forward and invest in the current rectification movement of historical significance with the same positive attitude. We believe that as long as they actively participate in this movement, resolutely criticize and defeat the rightists, and earnestly transform their own political stance, they will certainly be able to politically pass the test of the socialist revolution and steadily move towards the goal of being transformed into laborers.

Industrialists and businessmen across the country! Strive to welcome a new high tide of socialist transformation in politics and ideology, and to truly practice your resounding words of "Listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and take the socialist road"!

    工商界要全面开展整风运动
    在政治上过好社会主义这一关
　　李维汉同志谈工商界整风的重大意义和部署
    新华社26日讯　中共中央统一战线工作部部长、国务院第八办公室主任李维汉，就工商界全面开展整风运动的问题，发表谈话如下：
    我国现在正在进行一次政治战线上和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命运动。这次革命运动是以全民性的大辩论的形式来进行的，中心的问题是辨明资本主义和社会主义两条道路谁劣谁优，何去何从。现在运动正在推广到每个阶级和阶层中去。工商界的反右派斗争，已经进行了一段时间，最近上海和天津的工商界领导人员都同意我们的建议，正在准备开展全面的整风运动。民主建国会中央委员会和全国工商业联合会执行委员会即将召开联席会议，讨论全国工商界整风的问题。我们认为：在全国工商界全面开展一次包括反右派斗争在内的整风运动，是十分必要的，意义是十分重大的。
　　工商界的左中右三派
    左派分子站稳了社会主义立场；右派分子企图使资本主义复辟；人数最多的中间分子具有不同程度的两面性。
    1956年的社会主义改造高潮到来以后，资本主义工商业实行了全行业公私合营，基本上实现了从生产资料的资本主义所有制到社会主义所有制的变革。这就使得资产阶级分子的社会经济地位开始由剥削者向劳动者转化，使得他们在接受社会主义改造的道路上跨进了重要的一步。但是，工商界中除了少数左派分子在政治上已经站稳社会主义立场即工人阶级立场，坚决拥护共产党的领导，坚决走社会主义的道路以外，多数人并没有随着社会经济地位的改变对他们自己的政治立场和思想进行必要的改造，其中一小部分人至今抗拒改造，坚持资本主义立场，企图使资本主义复辟。这一小部分抗拒改造、坚持资本主义立场的人，就是右派分子。他们反对共产党的领导，反对走社会主义的道路。其中的极右分子野心很大，不仅有反动言论，而且向党向人民向社会主义猖狂进攻。工商界人数最多的一部分是中间分子，他们的特点是在政治立场上具有不同程度的两面性。他们一方面在不同程度上倾向于接受共产党的领导而走社会主义的道路，但是另一方面，又基本上还没有抛弃资本主义立场，对于交出企业，对社会主义，对工人阶级和共产党的领导，并不甘心和心服，对资本主义还有留恋。我们说中间分子具有不同程度的两面性，是因为这个阶层的政治态度又有几种不同的情况：一小部分人比较接近左派，一部分人比较接近右派，另一部分人动摇于两者之间。中间分子的两面性，使得他们不时地摇摆于左右两派的影响之间。从他们在不同程度上倾向于接受社会主义道路和共产党领导一面说来，中间派已经在从资本主义立场到社会主义立场的长途中跨进了第一步，可能在共产党领导之下，继续接受和完成社会主义改造。但是另一方面，他们还在不同程度上保持着资本主义立场的一面，是通向右派的，这就使得中间分子自身成为右派分子争取和笼络的对象，使得右派分子还能够在工商界保持他们的政治影响。前些时候，由于右派分子的猖狂进攻还没有遇到反击，相当多的中间分子特别是中间偏右分子，在右派分子的蒙蔽和煽惑之下，政治态度曾经发生显著的动摇和右倾。反右派斗争开展以后，他们才逐步清醒过来，许多人并且随着斗争的发展和深入而逐步向左转化，但是，就到目前，还有一部分人没有从右派的影响下解脱出来。
    在这里，必须指出，资本主义经济在我国社会主义革命以前和以后的地位具有本质的区别。在社会主义革命以前，资本主义经济具有有利于国计民生的积极性一面和不利于国计民生的消极性一面。因此，人民政府对待资本主义的政策，是利用它的积极性，限制它的消极性，逐步把它改造成为社会主义经济。在这一改造已经基本上完成以后，在社会主义革命已经在生产资料所有制方面取得了决定性的胜利以后，资本主义经济就不再具有积极性了。在这种情况下，人们如果继续坚持资本主义立场，企图恢复资本主义经济，那就是企图使历史倒退，那就是一种反动的立场。
    目前在我国还有相当数量的个体手工业和个体小商业，但是这些经济成分一般地是受社会主义经济领导的，并不属于资本主义范围。我国的自由市场也是在国家管理之下，它是社会主义的有组织的市场的一种补充。在特殊条件下，如果政府认为必要，也可以允许某些完全遵守政府法令的零星的小型的资本主义性质的企业存在，但是这是一种例外，需要个别的审查批准。至于不法资本家和其他投机分子违反政府法令、私自招收工人、用欺骗盗窃方法攫取原料、组织地下工厂、组织黑市、进行投机买卖等破坏社会主义经济的活动，政府就要严格地加以取缔。
　　两条道路何去何从
    在政治上和思想上，工商界面前还摆着资本主义和社会主义两条道路何去何从的严重问题。或者是跟着右派走到反革命的绝路；或者是一心一意跟着共产党走社会主义的道路。
    在今天的社会条件下，资本主义立场不仅是反社会主义的，而且是同爱国主义的立场不相容的；有人以为今天站在资本主义立场上还是爱国的，这是十足的谬论。我们的国家现在已经成为社会主义国家，并且在社会主义建设的道路上蒸蒸日上，日益改变着原来经济和文化落后的情况，这是任何爱国者都感到欢欣鼓舞的。爱这样的国，就必然要爱社会主义，接受工人阶级和共产党的领导，就必然要否定资本主义立场。因为坚持资本主义立场就是要在我国实现资本主义复辟，反对社会主义，反对共产党，把中国拖回到殖民地道路上去。坚持这样反动立场的人还会爱社会主义的祖国么？当然是绝对不可能的。在今天的条件下，任何人只要真正爱国，就必须否定资本主义立场，站到社会主义立场上来。
    由此可见，从政治上思想上说来，在工商界的面前还摆着一个资本主义和社会主义两条道路何去何从的严重问题。或者是跟着右派走，被右派带引到反革命的绝路上去，全国人民决不允许也决不希望工商业者走上这条绝路；或者是一心一意地而不是三心二意地跟着共产党走，走社会主义的道路，继续前进，获得光明的前途。这就必须同右派分子坚决进行斗争，必须努力改变自己的政治立场，真正转到社会主义这一边来。为了这个目的，工商界就必须全面开展一个以反对右派、破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为教育内容的整风运动。
　　辩论的中心题目
    社会主义制度的优越性；资本主义经济和资本主义立场的反动性；当前资产阶级的两面性；继续接受社会主义改造；接受共产党领导；同工人的关系；公方代表制度。
    为了使工商界的整风运动成为在广大工商业者中进行一次生动的和深刻的社会主义教育，必须就有关两条道路的大是大非进行辩论。根据毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中所提出的六条标准，结合现时工商界的特点，我们认为可以把下列问题作为辩论的中心题目：第一、社会主义制度的优越性问题；第二、资本主义经济和资本主义立场的反动性问题；第三、当前资产阶级的两面性问题；第四、继续接受社会主义改造问题；第五、接受共产党领导问题；第六、同工人的关系问题；第七、公私合营企业的公方代表制度问题；等等。各地可以根据当地情况提出必须辩论的问题。
    今后工商界的反右派斗争需要注意什么？这要看斗争的发展情况。一般地说，要打垮右派就必须下决心，就必须反得彻底。要下决心，就首先要克服右倾观点和温情主义，不使右派分子获得避风港。所谓反得彻底，就是要坚持摆事实、讲道理的方法，对右派分子的反动言行进行彻底的揭露和深入的批判。这样，右派分子就孤立了；他们孤立了的时候，就有再接受改造的可能。在揭发右派分子的时候，为弄清楚他们的反动言行的来龙去脉，就会追查到他们的历史根源。这并不意味着一般要追查人们的历史，而只是因为右派分子向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，同时又好耍两面手法，把自己描绘成出污泥而不染的莲花，人们为了弄清真相，才不得不翻出这些右派分子的老底。在斗争右派分子的时候，应当防止和改正粗暴简单的方式方法，因为这对于打垮右派、教育群众都不利。要允许右派分子参加辩论，因为这样更有利于分清是非、敌我，更有利于揭穿右派分子的反动面貌。
　　整风运动的部署
    在骨干分子中彻底进行反右派斗争，然后进行整风；在一般资本家中，反右派斗争要分别不同情况处理；在小型工商业者中，立即进行社会主义教育；少数民族地区已实行社会主义改造的工商业者，可按具体情况进行整风。
    各地工商界的整风运动怎样部署？原则上，要根据工商业者的不同情况采取不同的要求和方式。
  （一）在工商界骨干分子中（包括全体民建会员、各级工商联委员、同业公会委员、民建会和工商联的机关工作干部），应当进行彻底的反右派斗争，然后在反右派斗争胜利的基础上进行一般的整风。一般的整风要根据毛主席所提出的六条标准，结合上述几个中心题目和反右派斗争的经验，进行深入的学习和批评、自我批评。要本着团结—批评—团结的公式，采用和风细雨的方法，自由辩论，互相帮助，共同进步，而不要采用人人检讨过关的方法。（二）在工商界骨干分子以外的资本家和资本家代理人中，原则上也应当进行反右派斗争，但是可以按照城市大小、人数多少，分别不同情况去处理。城市较小、人数较少的，可以同上述骨干分子一起进行反右派斗争。大城市人数过多，一般资本家和资本家代理人不可能同上述骨干分子一起进行反右派斗争，在这种情况下，上海、天津拟先在上述骨干分子中开展和深入反右派斗争，然后再决定是否在他们中间进行反右派斗争，但是，反右派斗争教育现在就应当进行。上海、天津的这种部署，可以供其他大城市参考。（三）小型工商业者中一般可以不进行反右派斗争，但是必须向他们反复多次地进行通俗的反对右派、破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场的教育，做到家喻户晓。这种教育要立即动手进行。希望各地参酌全国和当地反右派斗争的情况和经验，编写通俗的宣传材料，并且培养、训练能作通俗报告的宣传员。（四）少数民族地区的工商业者已经实行社会主义改造的，可以进行整风运动，整风运动的部署、步骤和方法以及是否进行反右派斗争，可以按照各自治地方和民族地区的具体情况处理。
    工商界的整风运动，在党的领导下，可以由民建会（在有民建会组织的地方）和工商联联合进行。这是工商界具有历史意义的规模宏大的自我改造工作，也是民建会和工商联当前极其光荣的任务。希望民建会和工商联在党的领导和帮助下，胜利地完成这个光荣的任务。
    现在，工商界的整风运动虽然还待进一步开展和深入，但是随着反右派斗争的开展，工商界的右派开始瓦解，而占多数地位的中间分子的态度日渐增多地向左转过来。如果我们能够使这个伟大的运动顺利地普及和深入于工商界，我们就能够达到巩固、扩大左派，争取、教育中间派，打击、孤立、分化右派的目的。特别是中间分子，经过这次深刻的教育，除了有些停止不前以至向右转化的分子外，多数人可能向左转一大步，为尔后继续在政治上、思想上接受社会主义改造打下有利的基础。工商界中，除掉别有用心的右派分子以外，还有谁不想平平稳稳地完成社会主义改造呢？但是，要达到这个目的，事实摆明，必须在改变了生产资料的资本主义所有制以后，进一步解决政治立场问题和思想问题。对于去年敲锣打鼓迎接企业公私合营的大多数工商业者，我们没有理由不相信他们能够再前进一步，以同样积极的态度投入当前这一场有历史意义的整风运动。我们相信：他们只要积极地参加这个运动，坚决地批判和打垮右派，认真地改造自己的政治立场，就一定能够在政治上过好社会主义革命这一关，平平稳稳地向着改造成为劳动者的目标前进。
    全国工商业者们！为迎接在政治上、思想上进行社会主义改造的新的高潮，为真正实践你们的“听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，走社会主义道路”的响亮言词而努力吧！
