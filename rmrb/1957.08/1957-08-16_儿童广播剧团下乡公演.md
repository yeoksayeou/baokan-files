    Children's Broadcasting Troupe Performs in the Countryside

    To enrich the summer cultural and recreational life of children in the suburbs of the capital, the Children's Broadcasting Troupe of the Central People's Broadcasting Station will perform at the "Haidian District Workers' Club," "Xiyuan Organ Auditorium," and "Peking University" starting in mid-August. The main repertoire includes the recently rehearsed one-act plays "White Angel" and "In the Storm," as well as the one-act play "Terrible Dream," which received good reviews during its initial performance on "June 1st."

    This is an extracurricular art group. Except for a few specially invited actors, all the performers are students from elementary and middle schools in the capital, aged nine to sixteen, and wearing red scarves. Over the past few years, along with the Juvenile Broadcasting Choir, in addition to broadcasting on the Central People's Broadcasting Station's "Broadcast Program for Children," they have also recorded records, dubbed songs for the film "Flowers of the Motherland," and dubbed for films such as "Lights on the River" and "Young Drummer." This year, on "June 1st," they and the choir gave their first independent joint performance in the capital, which attracted attention from all sides, and many children wrote letters requesting them to continue performing.

    儿童广播剧团下乡公演
    为了丰富首都郊区孩子们暑期中的文娱生活，中央人民广播电台儿童广播剧团从8月中旬开始，在“海淀区工人俱乐部”、“西苑机关礼堂”和“北京大学”等处演出。演出的主要剧目有：最近新排的“白天使”和“暴风雨中”两个独幕剧，以及在“六一”初次公演得到好评的独幕剧“可怕的梦”。
    这是一个课余的艺术团体，演员除了少数特约的以外，全是一色带着红领巾的九岁到十六岁的首都各中、小学的学生。几年来，他们和少年广播合唱团一起，除在中央人民广播电台的“对少年儿童广播节目”里，进行广播外，还灌过唱片，为影片“祖国的花朵”配过歌曲，为影片“河上灯火”“少年鼓手”等配过音。今年“六一”，他们和合唱团在首都初次独立联合公演后，受到了各方面的注意，许多小朋友去信要求他们继续演出。  （樊庆康）
