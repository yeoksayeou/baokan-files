The short article "Why Have Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng Been Silent These Past Few Years?" temporarily reserved the answer regarding Feng Xuefeng. At the time, it was anticipated that this answer would eventually come, and it was hoped that Feng Xuefeng would proactively answer it. Not long after, the answer has been revealed (see People's Daily, August 27).

The answer regarding Feng Xuefeng reads with a strong, rotten, and pungent odor. But what is of more universal and significant meaning to us is not these things, but rather the glimpse we get from it into the terror of "I."

A single word, "I," runs through Feng Xuefeng's anti-Party activities of more than twenty years. After the national liberation, the first thing he said to Ding Ling when he met her in Beijing was: "How are they (referring to the Party) treating me? What are they saying?" Because of "I," he could feel "like a small stone being kicked aside" when people were in high spirits welcoming liberation. Because of "I," he could feel "ten years older" during those few days when people were celebrating liberation as if drunk and crazy. The word "I" caused Feng Xuefeng to turn somersaults, from an important Party worker, a soldier of the Long March, to a small, cowardly deserter, and then to an anti-Party villain. "I" even made him so arrogant that he attempted to elevate himself, stepping on the Party with one foot and on Lu Xun with the other, to become a golden-clad god in front of the people. For this, he could even risk total destruction in the face of heavy enemy encirclement to create divisions within his own ranks. For "I," he could spare no effort to collude with a small group of vulgar people after liberation, when people were concentrating their efforts on social transformation and social construction, becoming蛀虫 (zhù chóng) , termites, corroding our society. "I," oh, "I," is actually such a poisonous snake, full of venom, devouring people's hearts. How should people be on guard against it!

I am not advocating for the absolute abolition of "I." The human world is composed of numerous "I's," and if all "I's" were eliminated, collectivism would become something without practical content. However, the relationship between "I" and the collective is a fundamental issue. Like Feng Xuefeng, absolutizing "I," holding onto the idea of "those who obey 'me' will prosper, those who defy 'me' will perish," and taking "I" as the center of everything, using this to conduct oneself, handle affairs, and "transform the world," is a poisonous snake. It poisons society and collective undertakings, needless to say, but it also first poisons the snake charmer himself. From now on, history tells us that many people have ruined their reputations and careers precisely because of this; many current anti-Party elements and rightists are suffering from this poisonous snake syndrome. Conversely, if one is aware that "I" is a member of the collective, is aware of "my" obligations to the collective, and is always prepared to fulfill these obligations, this is an "I" that is an angel benefiting the collective, and this "I" is lovable. A person's willingness to sacrifice the individual (including life) for the collective interest is the correct expression of how "I" should treat the collective.

The private ownership system is the cave and thicket that breeds the poisonous snake "I." It was impossible to completely eliminate this poisonous snake at that time. On the contrary, it sprayed venom like fog, causing many people to be contaminated with toxins. Now that we have blocked the cave and leveled the thicket, it has become possible to completely eliminate this poisonous snake (this will certainly not be done in a short time). It is precisely at this time that the snakes rise up and dance wildly, desperately trying to open the cave, bite the snake charmers to death, in order to save themselves from destruction. It is no coincidence that all extreme egoists are desperately attacking the Party and socialism; and it is also no coincidence that many people have been deceived by them at one time. This requires people to not only fight the snakes, but also disinfect themselves.

The opposition between a worldview centered on the individual and a worldview centered on the collective is one of the fundamental contradictions between bourgeois consciousness and the consciousness of the working class today. Correctly overcoming this contradiction and moving forward is passing the socialist test. Conversely, the end of ruined reputation and career is waiting for them. This is history's arrangement, and individuals can only choose between the two centers, but cannot reverse history's arrangement.

    “我”的可怕
    庄农
    在“丁玲、冯雪峰为什么这几年沉默了？”的短文里，曾把关于冯雪峰的答案暂且存疑。当时曾预料这答案终究会有的，而且期望过冯雪峰主动地回答。时间过了没有多久，这答案揭晓了（见8月27日人民日报）。
  关于冯雪峰的答案读起来有着强烈腐朽气刺鼻。但是对我们具有更普遍更重大意义的还不是这些，而是从中使我们窥见了“我”的可怕。
    始终贯串在冯雪峰二十多年反党活动中的是一个“我”字。全国解放后，他到北京见到丁玲的第一句话竟是：“他们（指党）对我怎么样？说些什么？”因了“我”，他可以在人心振奋迎接解放的时候感到：“像块小石子似的被踢在一旁”。因了“我”他可以在人们欢庆解放如醉如狂的几天中感到：“老了十年”。“我”字使冯雪峰上下大翻筋斗，从党的重要工作人员、长征的战士，一翻而为渺小卑怯的逃兵，再翻而为反党的恶棍。“我”竟能使他狂妄到企图两脚升高，一只踏着党，一只踏着鲁迅，在人民面前成为金装的天神。为了这，他甚至可以在敌人重重包围之中，拚着全部毁灭的危险，制造自己队伍内部的分裂。为了“我”，他可在解放后人们集中全力于社会改造、社会建设的时候，不遗余力地同一小撮下流人物们勾结一起，成为腐蚀我们这社会的蛀虫。“我”乎，“我”乎，竟是这样一只饱含毒液，噬人心灵的毒蛇。人们要怎样对它善为戒备啊！
    我并不主张绝对地取消“我”。人类世界是由众多的“我”组合成的，倘使所有的“我”都消灭，集体主义也就变成没有实际内容的东西了。但是，“我”和集体的关系，却是一个根本问题。像冯雪峰这样的把“我”绝对化，抱着“顺‘我’者昌”“逆‘我’者亡”，一切以“我”为中心，以此来为人处事，“改造世界”，这是毒蛇。它毒害社会，毒害集体事业，固不必说，但它也首先毒害弄蛇的本人，自今以往的历史，不就告诉我们，有许多人正是为此身败名裂；如今的许多反党分子，右派分子，不就是患的这种毒蛇症。相反，倘自觉“我”是集体中的一员，自觉“我”对集体的义务，并时刻准备去履行这义务，这是为集体造福的天使的“我”，这“我”是可爱的。一个人为集体利益而勇于牺牲个人（包括生命），这是“我”应该怎样对待集体的正确表现。
    私有制是滋生毒蛇的“我”的洞穴和草莽，在那时彻底消灭这种毒蛇是不可能的，相反地它倒落雾般地喷洒毒液，使很多人都沾染上了毒素。现在我们堵塞了洞穴，铲平了草莽，彻底消灭这毒蛇已经成为可能的了（这当然不是一时就办到的）。也正是这种时候，群蛇才齐起乱舞，拚命想打开洞穴，咬死打蛇人，以挽救自己的灭亡。一切极端唯“我”主义的人，一齐都拚命向党向社会主义进攻，绝非偶然；而不少的人曾为他们一度蒙蔽也绝非偶然的。这还要人们一边打蛇，一边消毒才行。
    以个人为中心的人生观，同以集体为中心的人生观的对立，是当前资产阶级意识同工人阶级意识根本矛盾之一。正确克服这种矛盾而前进，就是过社会主义关。反之，身败名裂的结局就正在等待他们。这是历史的安排，个人只能在两个中心间有所选择，却不可能扭转历史的安排。
