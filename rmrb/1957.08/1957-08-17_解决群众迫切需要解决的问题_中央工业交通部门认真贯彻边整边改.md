Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: Many units of the central industrial and transportation departments have conscientiously implemented the policy of simultaneously rectifying and correcting during the rectification movement. In the past two months, based on criticisms and suggestions from the masses, these units have made many improvements in aspects such as employee welfare, organizational structure, personnel arrangements, business guidelines, rules and regulations, and leadership style.

In order to solve some pressing problems in the area of employee welfare, many departments have adjusted and improved the use of housing and welfare funds during this period, and improved some welfare facilities. For example, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry have all adjusted a batch of dormitories or offices based on their own capabilities and the principles of comprehensive consideration and rational use. Among them, the Ministry of Geology has adjusted a housing area of more than 2,000 square meters, initially improving the crowded dormitory situation; the housing tension in the Ministry of Construction Engineering has also been eased after adjustments. The Ministry of Building Materials Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry have all checked and announced the past use of welfare funds, corrected some unreasonable subsidies, and some units have also formulated new subsidy methods. The Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, and other departments have checked the wage levels of cadres based on the opinions of the masses. Some cadres in the Ministry of Construction Engineering whose levels were previously unreasonable have had their levels adjusted. In the Ministry of Light Industry, some units have also formulated adjustment methods for the unreasonable wages of certain cadres. In addition, many units have also paid attention to solving some problems in terms of meals, transportation, childcare, hairdressing, bathing, and environmental sanitation.

In terms of organizational structure, etc., the Ministry of Electric Power Industry has formulated a plan for the adjustment of the ministry and its subordinate organizations. According to this plan, the central and local management institutions can be greatly streamlined, and a large number of cadres can be delegated. At present, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the Hydropower Construction General Bureau have already delegated more than 200 technical cadres and management cadres. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has more than a dozen non-ferrous metal units in Yunnan, but because there is no unified leading body there, each unit has to send people to Beijing for instructions. In order to strengthen the leadership of these units, the ministry has decided to add a Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau in Yunnan. Based on the suggestions of senior technical personnel to make full use of the natural gas in the Sichuan area, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry recently organized a working group composed of responsible cadres to conduct on-the-spot investigation and research in the Sichuan area, and prepared to formulate a plan for the rational use of natural gas. In order to change the unreasonable parts of the Coal Mine and Oil Shale Mine Safety Regulations promulgated in 1955, the Ministry of Coal Industry established a special team headed by the director of the General Office, with the participation of relevant technical personnel, reviewed the regulation articles one by one, and revised and abolished some unreasonable articles. The confidentiality system stipulated by the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Electric Power Industry in the past was not entirely reasonable, and now it has been studied according to the opinions of the masses, and new regulations have been formulated separately.

During this period, the leadership style has also improved a lot. In order to share weal and woe with the masses, the leading cadres of many industrial departments have taken the initiative to give up a batch of dormitories, and at the same time, canceled some welfare benefits. For example, in addition to giving up some dormitories, some responsible cadres of the Ministry of Geology also appropriately reduced the area of ​​the office, freeing up houses to solve the needs of some people. The Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry abolished the small stove cafeteria originally set up exclusively for cadres above the division level during the rectification movement. Since the end of July, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has implemented a system in which responsible cadres meet with the masses of employees every week, and at the same time strengthened the work of handling letters and visits from the people.

In the process of rectifying and correcting at the same time, all units are continuing to study some of the broader and more complex issues raised by the masses, and are prepared to gradually resolve them. In general, explanations and clarifications have been given to the masses regarding some incorrect opinions and problems that are currently difficult to solve.

After earnestly correcting shortcomings, not only has a new atmosphere emerged in the work of many departments, but the relationship between leaders and those being led, and between the Party and the masses has become closer, and the enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly improved. Some people in the Ministry of Railways were very satisfied to see that the Communist Party was truly serious and earnestly correcting shortcomings based on their opinions. Their attitude towards rightists changed from onlookers to actively struggling against them, thus greatly isolating the rightists. Some units of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry and the Ministry of Construction Engineering not only satisfied the masses after correcting some shortcomings in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but also some people who had been investigated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries actively wrote wall newspapers and big-character posters, refuting the fallacies of the rightists who slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionary movement and countering the attacks of the rightists.

    解决群众迫切需要解决的问题
    中央工业交通部门认真贯彻边整边改
    新华社15日讯  中央工业交通部门许多单位在整风运动中认真地贯彻执行边整边改的方针。近两个月来，根据群众提出的批评建议，这些单位在职工生活福利、组织机构、人员安排、业务方针、规章制度、领导作风等方面，已经作了许多改进。
    为了解决职工生活福利方面一些迫切需要解决的问题，不少部门在这期间调整和改进了房屋、福利费的使用，改善了一些福利设施。如地质部、建筑工程部、石油工业部，都根据自己的力量和全面照顾、合理使用的原则，调整出一批宿舍或办公室。其中地质部已经调整出房屋面积两千多平方公尺，初步改善了宿舍拥挤现象；建筑工程部房屋紧张情况经过调整后也有了缓和。建筑材料工业部、化学工业部、电机制造工业部，都检查和公布了过去福利费使用情况，纠正了一些不合理的补助，有的单位还拟订了新的补助办法。轻工业部、建筑工程部等部门，根据群众意见检查了干部的工资级别问题，其中建筑工程部有些过去级别不够合理的干部已经调整了级别。在轻工业部，有些单位对于某些干部的不合理的工资问题，也已经拟订出调整办法。此外，不少单位还注意解决了伙食、交通、托儿、理发、洗澡、环境卫生等方面的一些问题。
    在组织机构等方面，电力工业部已经制订了本部和所属机构的调整方案。按照这个方案，中央和地方的管理机构都可以大大紧缩，并且可以下放大批干部。目前，电力工业部机关和水电建设总局两个单位已经下放了两百多名技术干部和管理干部。冶金工业部在云南有十多个有色金属单位，但是因为那里没有统一的领导机关，各单位有事都要派人到北京请示。为了加强对这些单位的领导，这个部已经决定在云南增设有色金属局。石油工业部根据高级技术人员提出的充分利用四川地区天然气的建议，最近组织了由负责干部参加的工作组到四川地区实地调查研究，准备拟订出合理使用天然气的方案。煤炭工业部为了改变1955年颁发的煤矿和油母页岩矿保安规程中的不合理部分，成立了以办公厅主任为首的，有关技术人员参加的专题小组，逐条审查了规程条文，修改和废除了一些不合理的条文。轻工业部和电力工业部过去规定的保密制度不尽合理，现在已根据群众意见作了研究，分别订出了新的条例。
    在这期间，领导作风也有了很多改进。不少工业部门的领导干部为了和群众同甘苦，都主动让出一批宿舍，同时取消了一些福利待遇。如地质部有些负责干部除了让出一些宿舍外，还适当减少办公室的面积，腾出房子解决了部分群众的需要。电机制造工业部在整风中取消了原来专为处长以上干部而设的小灶食堂。冶金工业部从7月下旬起实行了负责干部每星期接见职工群众的制度，同时加强了处理人民来信和来访的工作。
    在边整边改中，各单位对于群众提出的一些牵涉较广、比较复杂的问题，正在继续研究，准备逐步解决。对一部分不正确的意见和当前难以解决的问题，一般都向群众作了解释和说明。
    经过认真改正缺点以后，不少部门不但工作上出现了新气象，而且领导与被领导、党与群众的关系更加密切了，群众的积极性大大提高。铁道部有些群众看到共产党真正严肃认真地根据他们的意见改正缺点，都十分满意，对右派分子的态度，由旁观一变为积极斗争，从而大大孤立了右派分子。建筑材料工业部、建筑工程部有些单位在纠正了肃反中的某些缺点后，不但群众满意，有些在肃反中曾被审查过的人也积极写墙报和大字报，驳斥右派分子诬蔑肃反运动的谬论，反击右派分子的进攻。
