Rightists are "Wolves," Not "Grandma"
	Lu Xueshan, Deputy Director of the Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

	"A Few Opinions on the Problems of China's Scientific System" is a thorough anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist scientific program. The slogan "protecting scientists" in the opinion paper exhausts the ability to sow discord between scientists and the Party and the government. It's as if we scientists are all oppressed, helpless orphans, and rightists need to act as "protectors" to appeal on our behalf and bargain with the Party and the government. Anyone with a little brain cannot fail to see the respect and care the Party and the government have shown for scientists since liberation, and the strong support for scientific undertakings. No government in Chinese history has ever been so concerned about scientific undertakings. This is an ironclad fact, and it can never be erased by the shameless lies of rightists. As President Guo Moruo said, our country's construction undertakings are very heavy, with few people and a weak foundation, so it is inevitable that some scientists may not be guaranteed six-fifths of their time to engage in professional work. However, rightists use this to draw the conclusion that "scientists should take long-term leave from social activities and administrative work," that scientists should abandon the education the Party has given us in the past eight years, that we should return to the previous state of political ignorance, that we should become political illiterates, unable to distinguish right from wrong, and allow a small group of right-wing political careerists to manipulate us, to leave the Party, to leave socialism, in order to fulfill their conspiracy to restore the bourgeoisie. From this, we can see how vicious the methods of the rightists are!

	The guarantee of working conditions for scientific research has been gradually improving over the past eight years, which is an indisputable fact. Although it cannot be said to be perfect now, and needs to be continuously improved, compared with before liberation, it is not difficult to see the efforts made by the Party and the government in this regard, which is a world apart from the era of the reactionaries.

	Before liberation, most scientists were certainly not interested in the politics of the bourgeois reactionary rule, and the reactionaries were fundamentally unwilling to have patriotic democrats participate in their political activities. Of course, you would not have a share in things like representatives, committee members, and entertaining foreign guests. But since scientists did not ask about politics, they should have had six-sixths of their time to engage in scientific research. What was the fact? Have you forgotten the "rush to buy silver dollars"? Have you forgotten the days when monthly wages were not enough to buy two dou of rice? Have you forgotten the days when secret agents ran rampant and the city was full of storms, and you were trembling with fear? At that time, our scientists were considering the issue of "survival" in their minds, how could we talk about guaranteeing the time for professional work?

	Speaking of funding, I still remember that at that time, the entire foreign exchange quota of the Radium Institute of the Beiping Research Institute for one year was 200 US dollars. Books, instruments, equipment, reagents, medicines, and experimental materials all had to be paid for from this money. If you compare it with the annual expenditure of the Academy of Sciences in this area now, and still complain that the government does not guarantee scientific research funding, it is really spitting blood and having no conscience.

	Regarding the confidentiality system, it is true that some places in the past were too strict and rigid, but efforts have been made to improve it, and generally speaking, there is absolutely no possibility of it "becoming a major obstacle to scientific research" and "creating academic monopoly." Taking our Institute of Applied Physics as an example, all the materials from the production or national defense departments related to our research topics have always been completely open to us. Of course, for information within the scope of confidentiality, what is the need to disclose it to an expert who is not in this field or to an expert in this field who is not researching this particular problem?

	The Party and the government care for scientists in every possible way. I can also take myself as an example. I am a non-Party scientific worker. In 1954, I suffered from coronary thrombosis, which is a rather serious heart disease, and I was on the verge of death. The leadership contacted the hospital on the one hand, inviting cardiologists from all over Beijing to consult, and on the other hand, they tried their best to persuade me to rest in peace. The Party leaders of the Academy of Sciences took turns visiting me and repeatedly asked if I had any difficulties in life. Who could not be moved by this kind of cordial care, who could not feel the warmth of the Party and the love between comrades except those who have no conscience? What can be compared is that before liberation, Mr. Zheng Dazhang, a colleague at the Radium Institute, was a proud student of Madame Curie in France and was the first radiology expert in China. He suffered from heart disease. At that time, apart from paying half of his salary, which was already gradually depreciating, who had ever comforted him, who had ever cared about him? Before long, he died silently and scentlessly due to poverty and illness. Why didn't these rightists raise the slogan of "protecting scientists" to the reactionary government at that time, and now they are using it to alienate the relationship between the Party and us? Their intentions are really punishable.

	The most vicious thing in the "opinion paper" is the proposal of "research work following the person," "returning to the team," "no locomotives," and "restoring bourgeois social science." These arguments are nothing more than telling scientists to go their own way, not to obey the needs of the country, not to have unified academic leadership, not to serve socialist construction, and not to use Marxism-Leninism to arm their minds.

	Scientists, after five major movements and eight years of study, under the leadership of the Party, have united into a strong scientific army and are advancing on the road of socialist construction, and the military appearance is becoming stronger year by year, and the role it plays in socialist construction is also becoming stronger year by year. Since the "March Towards Science" and the "Twelve-Year Plan" were put forward, the scale has been advancing by leaps and bounds. Now the rightists are sparing no effort to use all kinds of lies and conspiracies to disrupt our ranks, and they have also viciously put forward the slogan of "treating everyone equally" to alienate our successors, trying to drag scientists back to a state of anarchy, no longer making any contributions to socialist construction, thereby postponing or ruining socialist construction. Unfortunately, their efforts are in vain. Today, eight years after liberation, the vast majority of scientists will not recognize "wolves" as "grandmothers." Even if they disguise themselves very cleverly, saying that this is "constructive advice," they cannot withstand the "demon-revealing mirror" given to us by Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." They immediately reveal their true colors and the truth becomes clear.

	But why do rightists especially value scientists and intellectuals? Why are they particularly enthusiastic about pulling our intellectuals away from the Party and away from socialism? I think the reason is very clear. Although our intellectuals have broken away from bourgeois ideology, the connection is still there, and bourgeois ideology can easily make a comeback in our minds unconsciously. The rightists have seen through our weaknesses, so they use this "killer move." This is really a vivid education and a strict test for me. After this struggle against the rightists, the political understanding of our scientists will inevitably be improved one step further. I fully support the oath proposed by President Guo: We scientists must adhere to the voluntary and conscious ideological transformation for a long time, and in the resolute struggle against the rightists, we will further improve our political and ideological level, unite more closely around the Party and the government, and continue to advance along the road of socialism.

    右派分子是“狼”不是“外婆”
    中国科学院应用物理研究所副所长　陆学善
    “对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”，是一篇彻头彻尾的反党反人民反社会主义的科学纲领。意见书内“保护科学家”这句口号，极尽了挑拨离间科学家同党和政府之间的关系之能事。好像我们科学家都是些受压迫的、举目无亲的孤儿，而需要右派分子以“保护人”的资格来代我们呼吁，向党和政府讨价。只要略具头脑的人，谁也不能不看到解放以来党和政府对科学家的尊重和爱护，对科学事业的大力支持。中国历史上没有一个政府曾经对科学事业有过这样的关怀。这是铁的事实，决不是右派分子的无耻谰言所可以抹煞得了的。正如郭沫若院长所说的，我们国家的建设事业十分繁重，人手既少，基础不强，所以必然有些科学家难免不能保证有六分之五的时间从事业务工作，但右派分子却借此作出结论，要“科学家对社会活动和行政工作长期请假”，要科学家放弃八年来党对我们的教育，要我们回到从前的对政治愚昧无知的状态，要我们成为政治上的文盲，不辨是非，听任一小撮右派政治野心家的播弄，离开党，离开社会主义，以遂他们复辟资产阶级的阴谋。从这一点便可看出右派分子的手段多么毒辣！
    对于科学研究工作条件的保障，八年以来一直在逐步改进，这是无可争辩的事实。现在虽然还不能说是尽善尽美，还需要不断的改善，但是跟解放以前比较一下，就不难看出党和政府在这方面所尽的努力，和反动派时代是不啻天壤之别了。
    解放以前，大部分科学家固然对于资产阶级反动统治的政治不感兴趣，而反动派根本也不愿意有爱国心的民主人士参加他们的政治活动，当然，什么代表、委员、招待外宾之类，是不会有你的份的。但科学家既不问政治，理应有六分之六的时间从事科学研究了。事实怎样呢？“抢购银元”的事情忘了吗？每月工资不够买二斗米的日子忘了吗？特务横行，满城风雨，提心吊胆的日子忘了吗？那时我们科学家满脑袋考虑的是“活命”问题，还能谈保证业务工作的时间吗？
    说起经费，我还记得，当时北平研究院镭学研究所全所有一年的外汇额是美金二百元，图书、仪器、设备、试剂药品、试验材料都得从这笔钱里支出，如果拿来和现在科学院一个所每年在这方面的经费开支比一比，还要埋怨政府不保障科学研究经费，那真是含血喷人，全无心肝。
    关于保密制度，过去有些地方订得过严过死是有的，但已经在设法改善，而且按一般来说，决没有“成为科学研究的重要障碍”和“造成学术垄断”的可能。即以我们应用物理研究所为例，凡是我们的研究题材和生产或国防部门有关的，他们的一切资料对我们一向是完全公开的。当然，属于保密范围内的资料，对于一个不是这一门的专家或者是这一门的专家而他并不在研究这一个问题的科学家或教授，有何公开之必要呢？
    党和政府对于科学家的爱护无微不至，我还可以拿我本人来作个例子。我是一个无党派的科学工作者。1954年我得了冠状动脉栓塞症，这是一种相当严重的心脏病，危在旦夕，领导上一方面同医院联系，邀请全北京市的心脏科专家会诊，一方面极力劝我安心休养。科学院党领导同志们轮流地来探望我，还再三问我生活上有无困难。这种亲切的关怀，除了毫无心肝的人以外，谁能不受感动，谁能不感到党的温暖，同志间的热爱？可以作为对比的是：解放前镭学研究所有一位同事郑大章先生，他是法国居里夫人的得意门生，是我国第一位放射学专家。他得了心脏病，那时除了把本来已经逐渐在贬值的工资折半付给之外，有谁去慰问过他，有谁关心过他，没有多久，他就因贫病交迫无声无嗅地死了。这些右派分子，那时为什么不向反动政府提出“保护科学家”的口号，而现在反用来离间党和我们的关系，真是其心可诛。
    “意见书”里最最恶毒的是提出“研究工作去就人”，“归队”，“不要火车头”和“恢复资产阶级社会科学”。这些论点无非是叫科学家各行其是，不要服从国家的需要，不要有统一的学术领导，不要为社会主义建设服务，不要用马列主义来武装思想。
    科学家经过了五大运动，八年学习，在党的领导之下，已经团结成一支强大的科学大军，在社会主义建设的大道上前进，而且军容一年比一年强盛，对社会主义建设所起的作用也一年比一年来的强大。自从“向科学进军”和“十二年规划”提出之后，规模更是一日千里。现在右派分子不惜用种种的谰言阴谋，想打乱我们的队伍，还恶毒地提出了什么“一视同仁”的口号来离间我们的接班人，要想把科学家拖回到无政府状态，不再给社会主义建设作出任何贡献，从而把社会主义建设推迟或搞垮。可惜他们的心机是白费了，在解放已经八年的今天，绝大多数的科学家是不会把“狼”认作“外婆”的。纵然他们伪装的十分巧妙，说什么这是“建设性的意见”，但是经不住毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这篇报告所授给我们的“照妖镜”一照，他们立刻原形毕露，真相大白。
    但是右派分子为什么特别看中科学家知识分子呢？为什么特别热中于拉我们知识分子背离党，背离社会主义呢？我想这道理非常明显，我们知识分子虽说已经和资产阶级思想脱离关系，但是藕断丝连，在不知不觉之中，最容易让资产阶级思想在脑筋中复辟。右派分子看透了我们的弱点，所以来这一下“杀手锏”。这对我真是一次生动的教育，严格的考验。经过这一次对右派分子的斗争，我们科学家的政治认识必然又可提高一步。我完全拥护郭院长所提出的誓言：我们科学家要长远地坚持自愿自觉的思想改造，在对右派分子进行坚决斗争中，进一步提高自己的政治思想水平，更加紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，沿着社会主义的道路继续前进。
