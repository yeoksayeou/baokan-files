Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Syrian Minister of State and Acting Minister of Defense, Azem, stated on August 22nd that the United States wants to impose its will on everyone, to rule over countries big and small, and make them submit to American will. When meeting with American journalists at his home, Azem also told them that the United States wants to make Syria "economically and militarily weak, so that we have to bow our heads and accept your policies in order to seek your assistance." Azem said: "You know very well that we will not succumb, and will never succumb to foreign rule, but you say that we have become communists, or are under Soviet influence, even though you clearly know that these are all lies."

Azem strongly condemned the US policy of oppressing Syria and other Arab countries. He said, "Your banks and the banks under your control refuse to lend us money except under barbaric conditions." He pointed out that the United States competes with Syria for markets to sell its agricultural products, but when Egypt needed wheat, it refused to supply it, while the Soviet Union supplied wheat.

Azem pointed out that the agreement between Syria and the Soviet Union is based on non-interference in internal affairs. He said that the United States is forcing others to accept conditions "with a few dollars and useless weapons that you ship to certain Arab governments." He said that the United States will encounter difficulties when Arab countries that accept American aid compare the assistance they receive with the assistance Syria receives from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Azem said that Syria wants to enhance understanding with the Soviet Union. He warned the United States not to force his country to cross the line of a policy of positive neutrality.

Syrian Minister of State for Information and Propaganda, Salah Akil, said on August 22nd that Syria will adhere to its policy of opposing imperialism. Referring to US President Eisenhower's remarks at a press conference on August 21st, Akil denied that the Syrian government and army officers have communist tendencies. He said: "Imperialism wants to create a reason and find a basis to continue to put pressure on Syria, so that Syria acts according to its wishes and accepts alliances such as the Eisenhower Doctrine."

Syrian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Tarazi also said on the 22nd that US President Eisenhower's remarks on the situation in Syria were "an interference in Syria's internal affairs." He pointed out that Eisenhower's remarks violated the principles of the United Nations Charter regarding non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

According to Western news agencies, after a series of consultations with Britain and other Western countries, the United States has tentatively decided to use pro-Western neighbors of Syria to exert pressure on Syria. The revealed measures to oppose Syria include: intensifying anti-Soviet and anti-Syrian political propaganda activities, economic blockade, minimizing diplomatic contacts, and intensifying border provocations.

　  叙政府领袖谴责美国干涉内政
　　叙利亚永远不会屈从外国统治
　  美英企图利用叙利亚邻国对叙施加压力
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：叙利亚国务部长兼代理国防部长阿泽姆在8月22日说，美国想把自己的意志强加在所有人的头上，想统治大小国家并且使它们顺从美国的意志。阿泽姆在他的家里接见美国记者的时候，还对这些记者说，美国要使叙利亚“在经济上和军事上都很软弱，这样使我们不得不俯首听命和接受你们的政策来求得你们的援助”。阿泽姆说：“你们知道得很清楚，我们不会屈从、而且永远不会屈从外国统治，但是你们说我们已经成为共产党人、或是在苏联影响之下，虽然你们清楚地知道，这些都是谎话。
    阿泽姆强烈指责美国压迫叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家的政策。他说，“你们的银行和你们控制下的银行除了根据蛮横的条件以外拒绝贷给我们款项”。他指出，美国同叙利亚争夺市场来出售它的农产品，可是当埃及需要小麦的时候，它却拒绝供给小麦，而苏联却供给了小麦。
    阿泽姆指出，叙利亚同苏联达成的协议是以不干涉内政为基础的。他说，美国是“以少数的美元和你们运给某些阿拉伯政府的没有用的武器”强迫别人接受条件。他说，当接受美国帮助的阿拉伯国家拿它们所得到的帮助和叙利亚从苏联和捷克斯洛伐克所得到的帮助进行比较时，美国会遇到困难。阿泽姆说，叙利亚要增进同苏联之间的谅解。他警告美国不要逼迫他的国家越过积极中立政策界限。
    叙利亚负责新闻和宣传的国务部长萨拉赫·阿基勒8月22日说，叙利亚将坚持反对帝国主义的政策。阿基勒谈到美国总统艾森豪威尔8月21日在记者招待会上的谈话时，否认叙利亚政府和陆军军官有共产主义倾向。他说：“帝国主义想制造一个理由和找到根据来继续对叙利亚施加压力，从而使叙利亚按照它的意愿行事和接受艾森豪威尔主义之类的联盟。”
    叙利亚外交部秘书长塔拉齐也在22日说，美国总统艾森豪威尔关于叙利亚局势的谈话是“对叙利亚内政的干涉”。他指出，艾森豪威尔的谈话违反了联合国宪章关于不干涉他国内政的原则。
    据西方通讯社透露，美国在跟英国等西方国家进行一系列磋商以后，初步决定要利用亲西方的叙利亚的邻国向叙利亚施行压力。透露出来的要反对叙利亚的措施包括：加紧展开反苏反叙的政治宣传活动，经济封锁；尽量减少外交往来；加剧边境挑衅等。
