　　Sell More Grain to the State
　　Increased Awareness Among Members of Zhang Wangyuan Agricultural Cooperative
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd – Members of the Zhang Wangyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Anyang County, Henan Province, have strengthened their political and ideological education, leading to increased enthusiasm for selling grain to the state.

　　The Zhang Wangyuan Agricultural Cooperative had a bumper summer harvest this year, with an actual yield of over 1,060,000 jin of grain. After deducting retained grain according to actual production, the cooperative should sell over 399,000 jin of grain to the state. However, because some cadres and masses wanted to retain more and sell less, after selling over 210,000 jin, they wanted to stop selling, leading to phenomena such as some production teams concealing production and not reporting it, which affected the progress of grain procurement work.

　　In response to the above situation, the Communist Party branch of the cooperative held separate meetings for cadres and the masses in mid-July, earnestly conducting education on the state grain purchase policy. They also used actual examples from the cooperative to carry out "three investigations and three calculations": calculate state support, investigate one's own contribution; calculate the superiority of the grain system, investigate the black market; calculate policy considerations, investigate retained amounts, thereby dispelling ideological concerns. After investigation and calculation, the members realized that although they suffered a disaster last year, there was no famine or begging, and no household went hungry, which were all results of the state's grain system. The investigation and calculation also confirmed that since the implementation of the state grain purchase and sales system, the peasants' retained grain has not decreased year by year, but has increased year by year with the development of production. Therefore, the members deeply felt the care of the state, and that the state's grain system is indispensable. After the members' ideological understanding was improved, they completed the unified purchase task in four or five days.

    多卖粮食给国家 
    张王元农业社社员认识提高
    据新华社郑州2日电　河南省安阳县张王元农业社加强政治思想教育，社员售粮生产情绪高。
    张王元农业社今年夏季丰产，实收粮食一百零六万多斤，全社按实产扣除留粮，应卖给国家粮食三十九万九千多斤，但是因为有些干部、群众想多留少卖，在卖出二十一万多斤以后，就想不再卖了，一度形成有的生产队瞒产不报等现象，影响了购粮工作的开展。
    这个社中共党支部针对以上情况，7月中旬分别召开了干部、群众会议，认真进行了粮食统购政策教育，并运用社里实际例子，开展了算国家支持、查自己贡献；算粮食制度优越性、查黑市；算政策照顾、查留量的“三查三算”，解除思想顾虑。经过查算，社员们认识到：去年虽然受了灾而史无前例的没有逃荒、要饭现象，没有一户挨饿，这都是国家实行的粮食制度的结果。查算也证实了从实行粮食统购统销以来，农民的留粮并不是逐年减少，而是随着生产的发展在逐年提高。社员们因此深深体会到国家的关怀，国家的粮食制度不可缺少。社员思想认识提高后，四、五天时间内就完成了统购任务。
