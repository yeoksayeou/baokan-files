　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 28th: French Finance Minister Gaillard announced on the evening of the 27th that the government has decided to freeze the prices of manufactured industrial goods at the levels of August 15th from that day forward, in order to restrain the inflationary pressure caused by the de facto devaluation of the franc. Among the post-war French governments, only the Pinay government had taken such measures in 1952.

　　Gaillard said that the decision to freeze prices applies to the prices of all products and services that were previously freely priced. The only two types of products whose prices are not frozen are: firstly, products whose raw materials are affected by the recently increased 20% import tax and steel products, the price of steel having recently risen by 0.5% to 4%; and secondly, products with export responsibilities.

　　At the same time, Gaillard also announced that the government had decided to reduce the price of all medicines by 4%. The prices of agricultural products have also been adjusted to some extent and are subject to strict restrictions.

　　Gaillard's price freeze plan had been opposed by the French "National Association of Manufacturers," agricultural operators' organizations, and small business owners and shopkeepers. After fierce debates with the government, the big business owners, fearing the wave of strikes demanding wage increases that would inevitably occur after the price increases, made some concessions to the government.

    害怕工人掀起罢工浪潮
　　法国政府决定冻结物价
    据新华社28日讯　巴黎消息：法国财政部长盖伊阿27日晚间宣布，政府已经决定从当天起把工业制成品的价格冻结在8月15日的水平上，以克制由于法郎在实际上的贬值而引起的通货膨胀的压力。在战后法国历届政府中，只有比内政府在1952年曾经采取过这种措施。
    盖伊阿说，冻结物价的决定适用于以前是自由定价的一切产品和劳务的价格。其价格不在冻结之列的产品只有两种：一是其原料受最近增收入20％的进口税影响的产品和钢制品，钢的价格最近已经上涨了0.5％至4％；一是负有出口任务的产品。
    同时，盖伊阿还宣布，政府已经决定把所有医药减价4％。农产品的价格也作了某些调整，并且加以严格限制。
    盖伊阿的限价计划曾经遭到法国“全国制造商协会”、农业经营者的组织和小企业主及店主的反对。在同政府进行剧烈的争论以后，大企业主慑于物价上涨后必然发生的要求增加工资的罢工浪潮而对政府作了某些让步。
