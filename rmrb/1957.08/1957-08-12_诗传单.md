    Poetry Handbill
    Lukewarm Feeling
    Tu An, towards the motherland, towards the people, you only have a bit of "lukewarm feeling"! Towards the rightists, towards the enemies, you also have a bit of "lukewarm feeling"! Since there is no strong love, naturally there is no strong hatred. Your feelings are truly too "mild"! Your position is not very "stable"!
    
    He Chopped Down the Sunflowers
    Zhang Fusong, a rightist element, returned from self-criticism, and in the evening, chopped down all the sunflowers he had planted. Because they faced the sun, because they faced the sun! Comrades, ah, comrades! The incident happened on the evening he returned from self-criticism.
    
    Letter of Surrender
    Sha Lei: A grain of sand cannot blind everyone's eyes; a black hand cannot cover the bright sky. We have rich experience in crushing sugar-coated bullets; we also have iron-like giant hands to break poisonous arrows. Put down your outdated weapons, rightist gentlemen, now is the last moment for you to surrender!
    
    Purpose
    Hai Lei shed a few fake tears, released a burst of smoke, once panicked, and also performed crawling on the ground begging for mercy. The only purpose:
   
        To escape the grasped tail
        To flee!

    诗传单
    温情
    屠岸对祖国，对人民，你只有一点“温情”！对右派，对敌人，你也有一点“温情”！既然没有强烈的爱，自然没有强烈的恨。你的感情真太“瘟”！你的立场不太“稳”！
    他砍了向日葵
    张弗松一个右派分子检讨回来，晚上，砍掉了他种的全部
  向日葵。因为它向太阳，因为它向太阳！同志们啊，同志！事情就发生在检讨回来的晚上。
    招降书
    沙蕾一粒沙子迷不了众人的眼；一只黑手遮不住明朗的天。我们有丰富的经验粉碎糖衣炮弹；我们也有钢铁般的巨手来折断毒箭。放下你们的陈旧武器，右派先生们，现在正是你们投降的最后的时辰！
    目的
    海蕾掉过几滴假泪，放过一阵烟幕炮，曾急得四脚朝天，又演过伏地求饶。目的只有一个：
  挣脱抓住的尾巴
  逃之夭夭！
