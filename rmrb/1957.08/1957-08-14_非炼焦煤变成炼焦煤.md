A study on transforming non-coking coal into coking coal has achieved success in laboratory experiments. Nie Hengrui, a professor at Dalian Institute of Technology and a part-time researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who is in charge of this experiment, said that existing tests have proven that non-coking coal can improve its coking properties through rapid heating, rapid preheating, and ultra-high-speed heating, giving this type of coal the same properties as coking coal. This research is of great significance for expanding the source of coking coal and developing the metallurgical industry.

    非炼焦煤变成炼焦煤
    一项非炼焦用煤变成炼焦煤的研究，已经在实验室试验成功。负责这项试验的大连工学院教授、中国科学院兼任研究员聂恒锐说，已有的试验证明，非炼焦煤经过快速加热、快速预热和超高速加热，可以提高煤的结焦性，使这种煤具有炼焦煤同样的性质。这项研究，对扩大炼焦用煤的来源和发展冶金工业，都有重要意义。
