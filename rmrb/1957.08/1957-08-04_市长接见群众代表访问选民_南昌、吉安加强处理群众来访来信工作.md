    Mayors Receive Mass Representatives, Visit Voters
    Nanchang and Ji'an Strengthen Work on Handling Mass Visits and Letters
    (By this newspaper) Recently, the Nanchang and Ji'an Municipal People's Committees of Jiangxi Province made decisions to further strengthen the work of handling people's letters and visits.
    In the past two years, the mayors of Nanchang and Ji'an, as well as the leaders of many units, have been able to regularly receive visiting masses and personally review some important letters from the masses. However, throughout the cities as a whole, some units and some people's representatives still have shortcomings in handling people's letters and visits. For example, in Nanchang City, the tendency to value official documents over letters from the people still exists in a few units. Some leaders do not personally receive the masses or review letters from the masses, and the phenomenon of forwarding letters from the masses layer by layer, shirking responsibility to each other, and handling them perfunctorily also occurs. In order to further strengthen the work of handling people's letters and visits, the Nanchang and Ji'an Municipal People's Committees held special discussions on this issue and stipulated some specific measures. The Nanchang Municipal People's Committee decided to: continue to implement the system of mayors receiving visits from the people, lead the work of handling letters from the people, and assign a deputy secretary-general to specifically manage it; each bureau, office, and association under the city's jurisdiction, as well as the People's Committees of each district, should have a bureau director, office director, chairman, district head, or deputy to be responsible for leading it, and a comrade responsible for secretarial work to directly manage it. Letters that need to be forwarded should generally be forwarded within three to seven days. In addition to stipulating the time for city leaders to receive visiting masses, Ji'an City also requires people's representatives to spend at least one time each month to go to voters' homes, organize small forums, and listen to the opinions and demands of the masses.

    市长接见群众代表访问选民
    南昌、吉安加强处理群众来访来信工作
    本报讯　最近，江西省南昌、吉安市人民委员会作出了进一步加强处理人民来信来访工作的决定。
    近两年来，南昌、吉安市市长以及许多单位的领导人员都能定期接见来访群众，亲自批阅一些重要的群众来信。但是，就全市范围来说，有些单位和有些人民代表处理人民来信来访工作还有缺点。如南昌市有少数单位，重公文、轻来信的倾向依然存在，有些领导不亲自接见群众和不批阅群众来信，对于群众来信层层照转、互相推诿，敷衍草率处理的现象也有所发生。为了进一步加强处理人民来信来访的工作，南昌、吉安市人民委员会对这一问题作了专门讨论，规定了一些具体办法。南昌市人民委员会决定：继续贯彻市长接见人民群众来访制度，领导处理人民来信工作，并由一副秘书长具体掌管；市属各局处、会及各区人民委员会应有一个局长、处长、主任、区长或副职负责领导，并由一负责秘书工作的同志直接掌握。需转办的来信，一般应在三至七日内转出。吉安市除了规定市领导人员接见来访群众的时间外，并要求人民代表每月至少抽出一个时间到选民家里去，组织小型座谈，听取群众的意见和要求。
