Where is the Jiusan Society going? This is a question that has arisen in people's minds since the start of the anti-rightist struggle, regarding the Jiusan Society's direction.

Based on recently revealed materials, Jiusan Society Chairman Xu Deheng undermined the Jiusan Society's organizational line and implemented the anti-socialist "great development" policy, ultimately transforming the Jiusan Society into a party filled with anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist elements.

The Jiusan Society's target for development was middle and upper-class individuals in science, culture, education, health, and other fields, primarily in large and medium-sized cities. However, Xu Deheng demanded "turning a small party into a large party," advocating unlimited "great development," which led to many politically complex individuals infiltrating the Jiusan Society. Even former representatives of capitalists with all kinds of vices, backbone members of reactionary parties and groups, landlords and despots, and historical spies were pulled into the Jiusan Society.

According to an investigation by Xinhua News Agency reporters, in the past year or so, the Jiusan Society's newly developed members amounted to 235% of its membership a year prior. During the anti-rightist struggle, a large number of rightist elements were exposed within the Jiusan Society's organization. The number of rightist elements already exposed accounts for slightly more than 3% of the total Jiusan membership.

In the past year, Xu Deheng was immersed in the frenzy of "great development." He promoted "great development" through various meetings and occasions. He used the number of members developed as a standard for evaluating cadres, severely criticizing cadres with poor development performance, even publicly scolding those who did not implement his organizational line as "criminals of the Jiusan Society." He vehemently opposed the policy of combining development with consolidation, saying, "The Communist Party can talk about consolidation, but the Jiusan Society cannot." In order to recruit people everywhere, he even said, "Even if they are bad elements, it doesn't matter if they are developed, it's better to rot in the society than to rot outside."

Rightist elements in local organizations greatly exploited Xu Deheng's erroneous policy and line. They recruited people everywhere, organizing forces to oppose the Communist Party. Gao Juefu, director of the Jiusan Society's Nanjing branch and a rightist backbone, in order to gather political capital to rival the Communist Party, recruited soldiers and bought horses everywhere. He once openly said to the Jiusan Society's cadres at a meeting: "I thought that after 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision' was proposed, the Communist Party and we would jointly transform each other, but who knew that the Communist Party still clings to it and wants to transform us. Can't we transform them?" In order to recruit two doctors into the Jiusan Society, even though the other party refused, he still asked people to forcibly send the application forms. Some places even unscrupulously competed for development targets. In Liaoning, Jilin, Henan, and other places, the Jiusan Society's organization was the most aggressive party in "grabbing people." At the Northeast University of Finance and Economics in Liaoning, some people received notices from two or three parties inviting them to meetings at the same time, making it impossible for them to be in multiple places at once. Some said, "Just join the Jiusan Society, just fill out a form." In Jilin Province, the heads of some grassroots organizations of the Jiusan Society and the China Democratic League even quarreled over development targets.

Last winter and spring, the Jiusan Society Central Committee sent people to several major cities in Henan with dozens of private letters of introduction to recruit soldiers and buy horses and "establish organizations by surprise attack." In order to develop members, they competed with the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the China Democratic League for development targets everywhere. They also deceived young students by saying, "The Jiusan Society is a political party of the working class," in order to entice young people to join. Zhu Zengxiang, the head of the Jiusan Society's Luoyang City directly affiliated group and a rightist element, participated in forums held by various government agencies, factories, and schools in the name of helping the Communist Party rectify its style during the period of great blooming and contending. At these forums, he would write down the names of anyone who expressed dissatisfaction with the Communist Party, and after the meeting, braving the wind and rain, he would go door-to-door to mobilize them to join the society.

The situation of recruiting people through deception and enticement existed everywhere. Qin Zan, the director of the Jiusan Society's Kunming branch and a rightist element, emphasized "developing the backward strata." He promoted to the elderly: "There are many older people in the Jiusan Society, and they get along well together." To those who had made mistakes, he said, "We don't carry out criticism and self-criticism within the society." To non-party individuals, he said, "Joining the society allows you to go to Beijing for meetings, visits, and entertainment." Wang Xueqi, a rightist element at Hebei Tianjin Normal College in Tianjin, distributed a large number of stamped application forms to lecturers, teaching assistants, and others, promising them positions and saying, "After joining the Jiusan Society, you can participate in the school's leadership work and serve as a member of the department committee." Wang Chengji, the director of the Jiusan Society's Hangzhou branch and a rightist element, often hosted banquets to recruit people. He told development targets, "The Jiusan Society only has organizational life once a month," in order to cater to the psychology of some intellectuals who are unwilling to attend too many meetings. Because Hangzhou's organization developed rapidly, they were praised by Xue Yu, a rightist element of the Jiusan Society Central Committee. The Jiusan organization in Jinan guaranteed to development targets "that they could not participate in organizational life, not attend meetings, not fill out ideological transformation and resume forms, and not submit photos." Zhou Shilu, the deputy director of the Jiusan Society's Nanjing branch and a rightist backbone, developed a person in the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture. Before it was approved by the Jiusan organization, Zhou Shilu wanted this person to develop others in the Department of Agriculture.

The development of the Jiusan directly affiliated group in Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province, is particularly noteworthy. Before last winter, there was no Jiusan organization in this city. Later, a teacher from a normal school rashly wrote a letter to Xu Deheng, "recommending himself," requesting to join the society and asking to establish a group in Jiamusi City. After receiving this letter, Xu Deheng unexpectedly approved his membership without considering the person's situation, and asked him to "develop the organization quickly." In the reply letter, he enclosed the application form and proved that he had become a member, and at the same time sent him a letter of introduction to negotiate with the Jiamusi City Committee of the Communist Party of China to establish the society. Now, this teacher has risen from the ground and has built a team of thirty-seven people, whose composition is extremely complex. Three of them are historical counter-revolutionaries, and eight are members of reactionary parties and groups and feudal leaders.

In Wuhan, some people criticized the Jiusan Society's development of organizations as being like usurious loans in the old society, which developed "with interest on interest" after a short period of time. Last winter, the Jiusan Central Committee saw that the Wuhan branch was developing slowly, so it transferred Li Zhuangyou, the secretary-general of the Xi'an branch and a rightist element, to "assist." In less than two months, the membership tripled. During the period of great blooming and contending this year, they wanted to "roll the dice" again and seize the opportunity to gain a profit. As a result, the number of people developed in May and June was equal to twice the number developed in the first four months of this year.

Xu Deheng often criticized and even put pressure on local organizations that were developing slowly. In March of this year, Xu Deheng criticized the person in charge of the Shenyang organization for failing to complete the development task. When criticizing Wang Zhixiang, the organization minister of the Beijing branch, he said, "Beijing's development is not as good as Shanghai's. In the future rankings, Beijing cannot be ranked first. Whoever develops more will be ranked first." On June 1st of this year, the Jiusan Central Committee criticized the Wuhan branch in its instructions for being "too conservative," instructing them to "seize the opportunity and strive to develop," and requiring them to "open up new strongholds in areas outside Wuhan." For this reason, Hu Ruzhang, a cadre of the Jiusan organization in Wuhan and a rightist element, went to Huangshi City during the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle to conduct political transactions and win over four well-known figures, including a non-party vice-mayor, to join the Jiusan Society.

The Jiusan Society's frenzied "great development" has created an unusually complex situation in the Jiusan organization. In the Jiusan organization in Beijing, the newly recruited members who have been exposed as rightist elements account for the majority. A rightist element in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, who claimed to have "joined the party on the front line" and launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, joined the Jiusan Society on June 4th. Now, among the fifty-three grassroots organizations of the Jiusan Society in Beijing, rightist elements have been found in thirty-four organizations, and nineteen of the rightist elements are in charge of grassroots organizations. Under the manipulation of the rightist element Wang Xueqi, Hebei Tianjin Normal College developed ten members in the past six months, four of whom are rightist elements, one who harbored deep hatred for the new society because his counter-revolutionary father was suppressed, and four others who participated in reactionary parties and groups. Among the new members developed by the Jiusan Society's Nanjing branch in the past year and two months, forty-nine had participated in the Green Gang, reactionary parties, groups, and Kuomintang secret service organizations, accounting for more than 40% of the total number of newly developed members. Forty-one rightist elements have been found in the Jiusan organization in Jinan, and four of the ten members of the preparatory committee of the Jinan branch are rightist elements.

Among the eleven rightist backbone members exposed in Wuhan, there are despotic landlords wearing the cloak of professors, capitalists with all kinds of vices wearing the cloak of engineering and technical personnel, and reactionary elements who colluded with imperialism to engage in anti-communism. All kinds of figures are available. Hu Ruzhang, a rightist element, believed that the "strength was insufficient" of the three members of Wuhan Water Transport Engineering College during the period of great blooming and contending. In order to put pressure on the Communist Party organization in this college, he urgently urged the Jiusan Central Committee to quickly approve the four members, including a despotic landlord, thus rapidly forming an anti-communist counter-current in the school and launching a frantic attack on the Communist Party.

The Kunming branch of the Jiusan Society was established in December of last year and only developed greatly during the period of great blooming and contending. During the anti-rightist struggle, two rightist small groups were exposed within this branch, one headed by Qin Zan, the director of the branch's preparatory committee, and the other headed by Miao Tianbao, a member of the preparatory committee. Qin Zan became a vanguard among the rightist elements in Yunnan. Taking Yunnan University as his stronghold, he made waves during the period of great blooming and contending, slandering various movements, provoking the relationship between the Communist Party and intellectuals, and openly demanding that the Communist Party "hand over personnel power" and demanding that "school leaders should take turns serving." Qin Zan and Miao Tianbao also relied on the Jiusan organization to separately win over a group of people to form small groups, attempting to usurp the leadership of their respective units. Now, this branch organization is in a state of disintegration.

### 九三学社要到哪里去？

　　九三学社要到哪里去？
    九三学社要到哪里去？这是人们从反右派斗争展开以来对九三的动向所引起的怀疑。
    根据最近揭露出的材料证明，九三学社主席许德珩破坏了九三学社的组织路线，执行了反社会主义的“大发展”的方针，结果使九三学社变成了一个充斥反共反人民反社会主义分子的党派。
    九三学社的发展对象是以大、中城市为主的科学、文化、教育、卫生等方面的中、上层人士。可是，许德珩要求“变小党为大党”，主张无限制地“大发展”，以致使不少政治上复杂的分子混进了九三，甚至有曾经是“五毒”俱全的资方代理人、反动党团骨干分子、地主恶霸分子、历史特务分子也被拉进了九三学社。
    根据新华社记者的调查，在最近一年多来，九三新发展的成员相当于一年以前的235％。在反右派斗争中，九三的组织中揭露出大批右派分子，目前已经揭露出来的右派分子的数目占九三成员总数的3％强。
    许德珩在最近一年内沉醉于“大发展”的狂热中，他通过各种会议、各种场合来宣传“大发展”。他把发展成员多少作为考核干部的标准，对发展成绩小的干部进行严厉的批评，甚至公然骂不执行他的组织路线的干部是“九三的罪人”。他竭力反对执行发展与巩固相结合的方针，他说：“共产党可以谈巩固，九三不能谈巩固。”为了到处拉人，他甚至说：“就是坏分子，发展进来也没关系，烂在社里比烂在外面好。”
    地方组织中的右派分子大大利用了许德珩这一错误的方针、错误的路线，他们到处拉人，组织反对共产党的力量。九三学社南京分社主任委员、右派骨干分子高觉敷为了搜罗与共产党分庭抗礼的政治资本，到处招兵买马，他曾公开在一次会议上对九三学社的干部说：“我以为‘长期共存、互相监督’提出后，共产党和我们共同改造，那知共产党现在仍抱住不放，还是要改造我们，难道我们不能改造他们？”他为了拉两个医师加入九三，对方虽然拒绝，但他仍然叫人把申请入社的表格硬给送去。有些地方甚至不择手段地互相争夺发展对象。在辽宁、吉林、河南等地，九三学社的组织是“抢人”最厉害的一个党派。在辽宁东北财经学院有的人同时接到两三个党派邀请开会的通知，弄得这些人分身无术，有的就说：“干脆参加九三吧，一填表就行。”吉林省有的九三和民盟的基层组织负责人，为了争夺发展对象竟争闹起来。
    九三学社中央在去冬今春曾先后派人带着几十份私人介绍信去河南几个大城市招兵买马，“突击建立组织”。为了发展成员，他们到处和民革、民盟争夺发展对象。他们并且欺骗青年学生说：“九三学社是工人阶级的政党”，以此来引诱青年们参加。九三学社洛阳市直属小组负责人，右派分子朱增祥，在大鸣大放时期以帮助共产党整风的名义，参加各机关、工厂、学校所举行的座谈会。在这些座谈会上，只要是提对共产党不满意的意见的人，他就记下名字，会后冒着大风大雨，打着雨伞，挨户动员他们入社。
    通过欺骗拉拢的方式来拉人的情况，各地都有。九三学社昆明分社的主任委员、右派分子秦瓒，强调“发展落后层”。他向老年人宣传：“九三年纪大的人多，在一起合得来。”对犯过错误的人说：“我们社内不开展批评与自我批评。”向无党派人士说：“入社可以到北京开会、参观、玩耍。”天津市河北天津师范学院的右派分子王学奇，把大批已经盖好图章的入社表格散发给讲师、助教等，他封官许愿地说：“加入九三以后可以参加学校的领导工作，担任系委员。”九三学社杭州分社主任委员、右派分子王承基，经常设宴请客来拉人，他对发展对象说：“九三学社每月只过一次组织生活”，以此来迎合某些知识分子不愿多开会的心理。由于杭州的组织发展迅速，他们曾受到九三学社中央的右派分子薛愚的表扬。在济南的九三组织，向发展对象保证“可以不过组织生活，不参加会议，不填思想转变和履历表，不交照片。”九三学社南京分社副主任委员，右派骨干分子周拾禄在江苏省农业厅发展了一个人，还没经九三组织上批准，周拾禄就要这个人在农业厅里去发展别人。
    黑龙江省佳木斯市九三直属小组的发展，是十分值得注意的。这个市在去年冬天以前还没有九三组织，后来一个师范学校教师贸然写信给许德珩，“毛遂自荐”，请求入社，并要求在佳木斯市成立小组。许德珩收到这封信以后，竟毫不考虑这个人的情况，立即批示“欢迎”他入社，并要他“赶快发展组织”。在回信时随函寄去入社的表格，并证明他已成为社员，同时寄给他一封同中共佳木斯市委交涉建社的介绍信。现在，这位教师平地起家，已经拉起了一个三十七人的队伍，其中成份极为复杂，有三人是历史反革命分子，有八人是反动党团分子和封建头子。
    在武汉市，有人批评九三发展组织好像旧社会放“驴打滚”高利贷一样，三滚两滚就“连本加利”地发展起来。去年冬，九三中央看到武汉分社发展迟缓，便调派西安分社秘书长、右派分子李壮猷去
  “协助”，不到两个月，成员增长了三倍。今年大鸣大放时期，他们又要“打一个滚”，乘机捞一把，结果在5、6两月发展的人数等于今年头四个月的一倍。
    对于发展迟缓的地方组织，许德珩经常给予批评，甚至施加压力。今年3月，许德珩曾经批评沈阳组织的负责人没有完成发展任务。他在批评北京市分社组织部长王之相时说：“北京发展不如上海，以后排列名次北京不能列在第一，谁发展多就把谁列在第一位。”今年6月1日，九三中央在给武汉分社的指示中批评他们“太保守”，指令他们“抓紧时机，努力发展”，并且要求“在武汉以外地区开辟新的据点”。为此，武汉市九三组织的干部、右派分子胡儒璋在反右派斗争开始的时候，还到黄石市进行政治交易，拉拢非党副市长等四位知名人士加入九三。
    九三学社这样狂热的“大发展”，造成了九三组织异常复杂的情况。北京市的九三组织中，目前揭露出的右派分子新社员占了多数。冶金工业部有一个自称是“火线入党”的向共产党猖狂进攻的右派分子，是在6月4日加入九三的。现在九三学社北京市的五十三个基层组织中，有三十四个组织发现有右派分子，右派分子中有十九人是基层组织的负责人。河北天津师范学院在右派分子王学奇的操纵下，最近半年来发展了十个社员，其中有四个是右派分子，一个因为反革命的父亲被镇压而对新社会有刻骨仇恨，另外有四个参加过反动党团。九三学社南京分社在最近的一年零两个月发展的新成员中，有四十九人参加过青帮、反动党、团和军统等特务组织，占新发展成员总数的40％以上。济南市的九三组织中目前已发现四十一个右派分子，在济南市分社筹委会的十个委员中，有四个是右派分子。
    武汉市揭露出的十一名右派骨干分子中，有披着教授外衣的恶霸地主，披着工程技术人员外衣的“五毒”俱全的资本家，有和帝国主义勾勾搭搭从事反共的反动分子。各种货色，应有尽有。右派分子胡儒璋在大鸣大放时认为武汉水运工程学院三个社员“力量不足”，为了向这个学院中的共产党组织施加压力，他电催九三中央从速批准了包括一个恶霸地主在内的四个社员，这样，就使这个学校的反共逆流迅速形成，猖狂地向共产党进行攻击。
    九三学社昆明分社是去年12月成立的，在大鸣大放期间才大发展起来。在反右派斗争中，这个分社内部揭露出两个右派小集团，一个以分社筹委会主任委员秦瓒为首，一个以筹委会委员苗天宝为首。秦瓒成为云南右派分子中的急先锋，他以云南大学为据点，大鸣大放时期兴风作浪，诬蔑各种运动，挑拨共产党和知识分子的关系，并公然要求共产党“交出人事大权”，要求“学校领导应轮流担任”。秦瓒和苗天宝并依靠九三组织，分别拉拢一批人，组成小集团，企图篡夺所在单位的领导权。现在，这个分社组织已呈解体状态。
