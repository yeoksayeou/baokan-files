Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 25th: Microgroove records and variable speed record players have recently been successfully trial-produced in Shanghai. The China Record Factory, which successfully trial-produced the microgroove records, is currently preparing to reproduce another batch, with production scheduled to begin next year.

　　Each side of a microgroove record can play for fifteen minutes, while an ordinary record can only play for a little over three minutes.

　　The grooves of this type of record are thinner than a strand of hair, and the number of grooves is twice that of ordinary records. This record only needs to rotate thirty-three revolutions per minute on a record player, while the speed of an ordinary record is seventy-eight revolutions.

　　The variable speed record player was imitated by the Rongsheng Electrical Appliance Cooperative based on a Czechoslovakian record player and has three different speeds. It can play ordinary records at seventy-eight revolutions per minute, as well as slow-turning microgroove records at forty-five or thirty-three revolutions per minute. This record player has already begun small-scale production.

　　Microgroove records are made of two kinds of plastic and are much tougher than ordinary records. If used carefully and well maintained, a record can be played two or three thousand times.

  　密纹唱片　变速唱机
    据新华社上海25日电　密纹唱片和变速唱机最近都在上海试制成功。试制成功密纹唱片的中国唱片厂，目前正在准备再复制一批，明年开始投入生产。
    密纹唱片每一面可以放一刻钟，而普通唱片只能放三分多钟。
    这种唱片的音槽比头发丝还细，圈数比普通唱片多一倍。这种唱片在唱机上每分钟只要转三十三转，普通唱片的转速是七十八转。
    变速唱机是荣生电工社根据捷克斯洛伐克的唱机仿造的，有三种不同的转速。它可以放每分钟七十八转的普通唱片，也可以放每分钟四十五转或三十三转的慢转密纹唱片。这种唱机已经开始小批生产。
    密纹唱片是用两种塑料做成的，比普通唱片靱牢得多。如果用得细心，保养得好，一张唱片可以放二、三千次。
