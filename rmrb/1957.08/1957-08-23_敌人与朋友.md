Enemies and Friends
By a commentator of this newspaper

    On August 20th, under the manipulation of Britain and the United States, the United Nations Security Council unreasonably refused to discuss the Arab countries' accusation against Britain's armed aggression against Oman, once again abandoning its sacred responsibility of maintaining peace and security. However, this Security Council also further brightened the eyes of the people of the Middle East, making them more aware of who their enemies are and who their friends are.

    The Imamate of Oman is an independent country. The two treaties signed in September 1920 between the Sultanate of Oman and the Imamate of Oman had clear provisions for the independent status of the Imamate of Oman. The British government representative, Barrows, also signed this treaty. Before oil resources were discovered in Oman in 1955, Britain had always recognized the independence of the Imamate of Oman. However, in order to cover up its aggressive crimes of plundering oil resources in the Arabian Peninsula, Britain now insists that Oman is not an independent country, and describes its aggression against Oman as "helping to suppress the rebellion at the request of the Sultan." This absurd argument of Britain, which affirms the "legitimate" nature of colonial wars with colonial ties, was supported by France at the meeting. The French representative believed that Britain's "logic" also applied to the Algerian issue. On the point of jointly suppressing the Arab national independence movement, British and French colonialists once again converged.

    The United States' support within and outside the Security Council played a major role in Britain's daring to quibble unreasonably in the Security Council. Before the Security Council discussed the Oman issue, the Imam of Oman had appealed to the United States authorities, requesting that they try to stop Britain's aggression, but the United States had been ignoring it. The United States' abstention in the Security Council fully demonstrates that the United States is actually supporting the British aggressors in suppressing the Arab people's struggle for independence. US Representative Lodge said at the Security Council: "Now that the military conflict has subsided, the United States hopes that all parties concerned will take advantage of the relatively calm situation in the region to resolve any legitimate grievances that may be involved through peaceful means." This actually affirms Britain's current colonial rule over Oman.

    The United States' ambiguous approach to supporting British aggression on the Oman issue is inseparable from the current situation of the United States in the Middle East. Recently, the Syrian people bravely smashed the US subversive conspiracy, which has dealt a severe blow to the Eisenhower Doctrine. This makes the United States have to adopt a more covert approach on the Oman issue, so as to avoid further exposing its aggressive face among the Arab people, and at the same time can win British support for its subversive activities against Syria. After the Security Council meeting, Britain feigned dissatisfaction with the US abstention, but this cannot conceal the dirty deals that the United States and Britain had made before the meeting. The day before the Security Council meeting, the United States and Britain held a high-level meeting in Washington on the Syrian situation, reaching an agreement between the two countries to mutually support the suppression of the Arab national independence movement. The United States' actions in the Security Council had been tacitly approved by Britain in advance. The United States and Britain are just trying to deceive the people of the Middle East Arab countries and the people of the world by pretending.

    In order to find an excuse for its aggression against the Middle East Arab countries, the United States has always tried its best to slander the Soviet Union. After the US conspiracy to subvert the current government of Syria was exposed, it is still wantonly slandering and attacking the Soviet Union. However, this shameless trick of the United States cannot hinder the development of friendship between the Soviet Union and the Arab people. At this Security Council, it was once again proved that the Soviet Union sincerely supports the Arab national liberation struggle. Soviet Representative Sobolev actively supported the Arab countries' demands on the Oman issue, not only advocating that the Oman issue be included in the agenda, but also demanding that the Security Council take effective measures to stop British aggression, and at the same time forcefully refuted the various fallacies of Western colonial countries that slandered the Arab people's struggle for independence. The Soviet Union's principled position of supporting the just cause of the Arab people has been praised by the Arab countries and fair public opinion all over the world.

    Now, although the Security Council has rejected the Arab people's accusations, it cannot stop the great struggle of the Arab people for independence.

    8月20日，联合国安全理事会在英美的操纵之下，无理地拒绝了讨论阿拉伯国家对英国武装侵略阿曼的控诉案，再一次放弃了它的维护和平和安全的神圣职责。但是，这次安理会也更加擦亮了中东人民的眼睛，使他们更加认清了谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。
    阿曼教长国是一个独立国家。1920年9月，阿曼苏丹国和阿曼教长国签订的两个条约中，对于阿曼教长国的独立地位有过明确的规定。英国政府的代表巴路斯也在这个条约上签了字。在1955年阿曼发现石油资源以前，英国一直是承认阿曼教长国的独立的。但是，英国现在为了掩饰它在阿拉伯半岛掠夺石油资源的侵略罪行，却硬说阿曼不是一个独立国，把它对阿曼的侵略行为，说成是“应苏丹的请求来帮助镇压叛乱”的。英国这种以殖民主义联系来肯定殖民战争“合法”性质的荒谬论调，在会上得到了法国的支持。法国代表认为英国这个
  “逻辑”也适合于阿尔及利亚问题。在共同镇压阿拉伯民族独立运动这一点上，英法殖民主义者再一次合流了。
    英国之所以敢于在安理会上蛮不讲理地进行狡辩，美国在会内会外的支持起了很大的作用。早在安理会讨论阿曼事件以前，阿曼教长就曾向美国当局发出呼吁，要求设法制止英国的侵略行为，但是美国一直对此置之不理。美国在安理会上投弃权票，充分地表明了美国实际上是在支持英国侵略者镇压阿拉伯人民的独立斗争。美国代表洛奇在安理会上说：“既然军事冲突已经平息下来，美国希望一切有关方面趁着这个地区呈现的比较平静的局面，用和平的方法解决可能涉及的任何正当的不满”。这实际上是肯定了英国目前对阿曼的殖民统治。
    美国在阿曼问题上使用暧昧的手法来支持英国侵略，是同美国目前在中东的处境分不开的。最近，叙利亚人民英勇地粉碎了美国的颠覆阴谋，已给予艾森豪威尔主义以严重打击。这就使得美国在阿曼问题上不得不采取比较隐蔽的手法，以免使自己的侵略面貌在阿拉伯人民中更加暴露，同时又可争取英国支持它对叙利亚的颠覆活动。在安理会开会以后，英国曾假惺惺地对美国的弃权表示不满，然而这丝毫也不能掩饰美英两国在会前所进行的肮脏交易。在安理会开会的前一天，美英两国曾就叙利亚局势在华盛顿举行高级会议，达成了两国间互相支持打击阿拉伯民族独立运动的协议。美国在安理会上的做法，事先已经得到了英国的默认。美英两国故作姿态，不过是企图欺骗中东阿拉伯国家人民和世界人民罢了。
    美国为找寻它侵略中东阿拉伯国家的借口，一向对苏联极尽污蔑之能事。美国在颠覆叙利亚现政府的阴谋败露以后，仍在对苏联大肆污蔑攻击。但是，美国这种无耻的伎俩，阻挠不了苏联和阿拉伯人民之间友谊的发展。在这次安理会上，再一次证明苏联是真心支持阿拉伯民族解放斗争的。苏联代表索波列夫积极支持阿拉伯国家关于阿曼问题的要求，不仅主张把阿曼问题列入议程，并且要求安理会采取有效措施来制止英国的侵略，同时有力地驳斥了西方殖民国家诬蔑阿拉伯人民争取独立斗争的各种谬论。苏联这种支持阿拉伯人民正义事业的原则立场，得到了阿拉伯国家和全世界公正舆论的同声赞誉。
    现在，安理会虽然拒绝了阿拉伯人民的控诉，但是它阻止不了阿拉伯人民争取独立而进行的伟大斗争。
