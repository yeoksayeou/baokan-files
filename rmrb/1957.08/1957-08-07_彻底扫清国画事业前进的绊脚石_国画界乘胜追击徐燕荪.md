    This newspaper reports: The struggle by the capital's Chinese painting community against rightist ringleader Xu Yansun and others has greatly pleased the Chinese painting community. Everyone has used phrases like "seeing the sun after the clouds clear" and "the ice river thawing" to express their feelings. Many people have requested that further meetings be held to conduct a deeper struggle against the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of the Xu Yansun rightist clique, in order to thoroughly sweep away the stumbling blocks to the advancement of the Chinese painting cause.
    Lao She, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, said: After liberation, the Party did a lot of work to strengthen the unity of the Chinese painting community and cultivate Chinese painters. Many Chinese painters are willing to accept the Party's leadership, strengthen unity, and strive for progress, but they have not been able to unite well. The root cause of this is that Xu Yansun and others oppose the Party's leadership and the control of painting societies by ringleaders. Even when the Chinese Painting Academy was established, Xu Yansun actually wanted to carry out his conspiracy, using his own set of people, excluding dissidents, and usurping the Party's leadership. Lao She believes that it is necessary to continue to wage a resolute struggle against Xu Yansun.
    The elderly painter Chen Banding expressed great indignation at Xu Yansun, Wang Xuetao, and others for falsely using his name to incite trouble in the art world and for enticing him to join the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. The painter and guqin player Pu Xuezhai said: "The struggle against Xu Yansun in the Chinese painting community is not a matter of who is attacking whom, but rather a matter of seeking truth from facts, presenting the issues, and debating them so as to clarify major issues of right and wrong." Then he talked about the establishment of the Chinese Painting Academy, which was a major event in the Chinese painting cause, but Xu Yansun and others actually opposed the Party's leadership for their own selfish interests, attempting to control the Chinese Painting Academy. Who can not be indignant about this? The painter Yu Feian cited the example of running a Chinese painting publication to illustrate that without the leadership of the Communist Party, and allowing rightist elements to act recklessly, everything would be ruined. He said: "Since last November, there have been a total of nineteen editorial board meetings, but due to the control of rightist elements, the publication has still not been published. If we don't hold meetings to struggle against them, how can we succeed?" The painter Chen Yuandu narrated the situation of their painting society group. He said that everyone was very angry at Xu and others' hegemonic behavior in controlling the Chinese painting community and their anti-Party conspiracy; however, some people still had many concerns due to Xu and others' consistent ringleader control. They need to see the Party and the government's resolute support for this just struggle and bravely stand up to launch a struggle against Xu and others. Many middle-aged and young painters talked about this struggle with joy and excitement.
    Currently, people in the Chinese painting community are holding various gatherings to deliberate and prepare for a deeper struggle against the Xu Yansun anti-socialist clique.

    彻底扫清国画事业前进的绊脚石
    国画界乘胜追击徐燕荪
    本报讯　首都国画界对右派把头徐燕荪等的斗争，使国画界人心大快。大家都以“拨云见日”、“冰河解冻”等话来表达自己的心情。很多人要求继续召开会议，对徐燕荪等右派集团的反党反社会主义言行作更深入的斗争，以彻底扫清国画事业前进中的绊脚石。
    北京市文联主席老舍说：解放后，党作了许多工作来加强国画界的团结和培养国画家，许多国画家是愿意接受党的领导加强团结力求进步的，但他们一直团结不好，这病根就在徐燕荪等人反对党的领导，对画会的把头统治上。一直到国画院成立时，徐燕荪竟想实行他的阴谋计划，搬用他的一套人马，排除异己，篡夺党的领导。老舍认为必须对徐燕荪继续进行坚决的斗争。
    画家陈半丁老人对徐燕荪、王雪涛等假借他的名义向美术界点火并引诱他参加农工民主党的事表示极大愤慨。画家、古琴家溥雪斋说：“国画界对徐燕荪的斗争，不是谁打击谁，而是实事求是，摆出问题大家辩论，以明大是大非。”接着他谈到成立国画院，是国画事业上一件大事，但徐燕荪等竟为了一己私利来反对党的领导，企图把持国画院。对此，谁能不愤慨呢？画家于非暗举出办国画刊物的例子，来说明离开共产党的领导，任右派分子胡作非为，什么事都会搞糟。他说：“从去年11月至今，共开过十九次编委会了，但由于右派分子把持的结果，至今刊物还不能出版。再不开会对他们进行斗争，还能成吗？”画家陈缘督叙述了他们画会小组的情况。他说大家对徐等把持国画界的独霸行为和反党阴谋都非常愤怒；但有一些人由于徐等一贯的把头统治，还有不少顾虑。他们需要看到党和政府对这一正义斗争的坚决支持，勇敢地站起来对徐等展开斗争。很多中年的和青年的画家都以欢欣鼓舞的心情，谈论这一斗争。
    目前，国画界人士正在进行各种集会进行酝酿，准备对徐燕荪等反社会主义集团展开更深入的斗争。
