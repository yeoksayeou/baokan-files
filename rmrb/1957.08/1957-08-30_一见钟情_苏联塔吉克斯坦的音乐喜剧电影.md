　　"First Love"
　　--A Musical Comedy Film from Soviet Tajikistan
　　Chen Feng
    Some people who lived through the old society, even after experiencing a long period of revolutionary life and witnessing all the changes, still stubbornly cling to their conservative ideas. They remain unaccustomed to the new ways of life and customs, always wanting to drag things back to the old ways, believing that is the truth, the proper way, and happiness. They suppress themselves and others, even their own children.
    The Soviet Tajik film "First Love" depicts such a story. The old man Mukhtar, originally a diligent manager of a musical instrument factory, holds an outdated concept: a virtuous girl should not leave her home. His daughter, Lola, loves to sing, and people are mesmerized by her beautiful voice. But the old man fears her singing for others.
    A young and talented singer, Said, falls in love with the girl. They both want to participate in a song and dance drama at the local "Workers' Club," but the old man strongly dislikes them being together. He tries every means to obstruct them, locking his daughter up like a caged bird. He only wants to arrange his daughter's happy life according to his own old ideas.
    Of course, in this new era, the old man's erroneous plans will naturally be tormented by reality. The younger generation, even if it's difficult, will pursue happiness according to their own wishes. The old man's efforts are in vain, and in the end, when he sees the happiness of the children at the local youth festival, he can't help but say, "Frankly, I envy your life."
    The film "First Love" uses a musical comedy format to depict this theme. I find it lively, interesting, and successful.
    The music throughout the play is simple and beautiful. It lacks the superficiality and extravagance found in some light music films of capitalist countries. It is accessible, lighthearted, and elegant. From beginning to end, the music is permeated with several beautiful Tajik (the story is about this Soviet Republic) national melodies. Many passages, like singing across the river and later the performances on stage, are both profound and deeply affectionate.
    The composer, Babaev, handles the musical arrangement of the entire film very appropriately. Lola's singing on the wall, in her home, and later in the cultural palace all have excellent effects.
    Particularly noteworthy are the voices of Said and Lola, which are rare in general musical comedies. The actor playing Said has a rare lyrical tenor voice, his singing is crisp, natural, and sweet. Although the film doesn't have many complex tunes to show off his technique, his fluency and deep affection are evident.
    The actress playing Lola has a pure and simple lyrical soprano voice, and her talent is also remarkable. Their singing is serious and lively, without any of the frivolous airs of typical musical comedies. This popular, lighthearted, yet dignified comedic musical style is very admirable. I think it would be very meaningful to introduce some of these songs and sing them as lyrical pieces in our light music life.

### “一见钟情”——苏联塔吉克斯坦的音乐喜剧电影

　　“一见钟情”
　　——苏联塔吉克斯坦的音乐喜剧电影
　　陈枫
    有一些在旧社会生活过来的人，虽然已经经历长期的革命的生活陶冶，他也亲眼看到，一切一切都变了。而他某些顽固的保守的观念，总不肯改掉。对于新的生活方式，生活风气，总不习惯，总想把它拖回到老一代的样子，而认为那才是真理，才是得体，才是幸福，他压制自己，也压制别人，甚至自己的儿女。
    苏联塔吉克斯坦电影“一见钟情”就是描写这样的一个故事，故事里的老头穆赫塔尔，他原是一个勤劳的乐器工厂的经理，但是保有一个过时的观念，认为一个姑娘，足不出户，就是美德，他的姑娘罗拉是非常喜欢歌唱，人们听到了她那优美的歌音，就像着了迷一样的喜欢，但这个老头，就害怕她唱给人家听。
    有一年青的天才歌唱家塞得对姑娘发生爱慕，他们俩很想一起参加当地的“工人俱乐部”演歌舞剧，而老头非常讨厌他俩在一起，他千方百计的阻难，像对付小鸟把女儿关起来。只想按照他自己的、旧的一些想法，来安排女儿的幸福生活。
    当然，在这新的时代里，老头儿这种错误打算会遭到现实的折磨，也是很自然的。年青的一代，即使很艰苦，也会按照他们的愿望去找寻幸福。老头儿白费心思，到后来，看到孩子们在当地青年联欢节的幸福的情形时，他自己也不能不说：“实在说，我也羡慕你们的生活”。
    电影“一见钟情”是通过音乐喜剧的形式来描写这一主题。我觉得是活泼有趣，而且是成功的。
    整个剧的音乐，平易而优美。它没有那些像资本主义国家的某些轻音乐片那样的肤浅、浮夸。它是浅近、轻松而又典雅。音乐从头到尾贯串着几首优美的塔吉克斯坦（这故事是描写这个苏维埃共和国的）民族调子。有许多段落像隔河对唱，和后来在舞台上的表演，都是很深刻很深情的。
    作曲家巴巴耶夫，处理整个片的音乐按排也很恰当，像罗拉在墙头上的演唱，在姑娘家里的演唱，和后来在文化宫的演唱，都有极好的效果。
    特别值得一提的是塞得和罗拉两个角色的歌喉，这是一般音乐喜剧中所少有的，饰演塞得的是一个难得的抒情男高音，他的歌音轻脆、自然而甜美。影片中虽然没有许多复杂的曲调来表现他的技巧，而流俐、深情是可以看得到的。
    饰演罗拉的是一个纯朴的抒情女高音，她的才艺也是不容易的，他们的歌唱，严肃、活泼，一点没有一般音乐喜剧那些轻浮的流气。这种通俗、轻快、而又庄重的喜剧音乐格调是很使人仰慕的。我觉得其中有好些歌曲，能够介绍过来，作为我们轻松音乐生活中的抒情曲来歌唱，是很有意思的。
