    Scatter the Seeds of Peace to the Five Continents
    By our reporter Cheng Guangrui
    On the evening of August 11th, as the wonderful festival was about to end, and as the time to part with young friends from all countries approached, the citizens of Moscow once again gathered on "Happiness Road," once again stopped the cars of the young guests, shook hands with them, and exchanged souvenirs. Half a month of joyous gathering had produced a close friendship between them, so much so that the moment of separation was filled with reluctant farewells. "Goodbye, goodbye!" "Safe journey!" "Peace, friendship!"... A chorus of cheers echoed on "Happiness Road."
    The Lenin Central Stadium had become a sea of ​​jubilation. At 9:30 PM, the closing ceremony of the Sixth World Youth Festival began. Listen to the solemn statement of the International Preparatory Committee of the Festival: "Our will to strive for peace is stronger than the atomic bomb. Our desire for happiness is irresistible. ... As long as the people of all countries and the youth of all countries always get along friendly as we do in this festival, a future of peace and happiness can be established. The friendship between the people of all countries and the youth of all countries is a guarantee of peace." This is the vivid conclusion of the festival, the heartfelt voice of thirty-four thousand young representatives from one hundred and thirty-one countries.
    At 9:50 PM, the festival was declared closed. The festival flag, which had been flying over the Central Stadium for half a month, slowly descended. Pillars of fireworks rose into the sky like colored fountains. At this moment, all the lights in the stadium suddenly went out, and a dreamlike scene appeared before people's eyes. Thousands of young female athletes in the stadium, holding torches, performed group calisthenics. The scene was filled with sparks, sometimes like rolling waves, sometimes like a flurry of stars – this was the youthful vitality of the young people leaping. Then, on the east stand, people used millions of small red, green, blue, and purple flags, illuminated by colored lights, to transform into the words "Peace" in various languages, transforming into the words "For Peace and Friendship" – this was the flash of young people's thoughts.
    The joyful holiday of youth has passed, and these wonderful days will forever remain in the memory of every festival participant.
    During the half-month of joyous gathering, people felt the greatest happiness, because they saw the peace demonstration of half a million people against the use of atomic weapons, and they saw the young people of various countries sitting around the table discussing how to strive for peace in Europe, Asia, and the world. They saw the seeds of peace growing in the minds of young people. The words of Ukrainian girl Uraled Lena Nani Laike at the Girls' Festival were meaningful. She said: "Everyone has a different understanding of happiness, and our common happiness is peace."
    During the half-month of joyous gathering, people experienced the greatest joy, because they saw Chinese and Americans chatting like old friends in the meetings of representatives, Europeans and Africans singing and dancing joyfully at the solidarity evening, in Red Square, on Gorky Street, young people from all countries were talking to the Soviet people every night. They saw the buds of friendship blooming in the minds of young people. South African female writer Phyllis Altman said: "Although I come from afar, I feel like I am living among relatives at the festival." The words of Egyptian female representative Naira Yelabud are also touching. She said: "I will always remember the friends I met here. There are many of them, young people from the Soviet Union, Poland, Tunisia, Korea, France, Bulgaria, and other countries. Although we have only known each other for a short time, it seems that our hearts have been tied together for a long time. The reason is very simple, because our wish is only one: 'Peace and Friendship.'"
    During the half-month of joyous gathering, people felt the greatest pride, because they saw that in the atmosphere of peace and friendship, through hundreds of various meetings, discussions, friendship competitions, and personal contacts, young people from various countries with different ideas had extensive contact and heated debates. They saw that the festival used facts to refute the slanders of the imperialists against the festival and the Soviet Union. The head of the Soviet youth delegation, Shelepin, said: "Western countries slander the festival and slander the Soviet Union. However, young friends from all countries who come to our country will see that the Soviet people are very good working people. They live and love like the people of all countries, give birth to sons and daughters. The Soviet people are willing to discuss with people from capitalist countries, seek common ground while reserving differences, and strengthen friendship." If anyone does not believe Shelepin's words, then please listen to the words of American youth representative Albala Bailey: "If anyone asks me what the festival left me with the deepest impression after I return home, I will answer like this, the Soviet people gave us Americans very good hospitality, they are sincere and kind, young people, no matter what differences they have, should often get together, in this sense, the festival played a great role, it shows: first, the people of all countries want peace; second, despite different views, all problems can be solved at the round table, there is no need to take them to the battlefield; third, the Soviet people, like the American people, do not need war."
    The festival also gave people very rich enjoyment in culture and art. During the festival, young artists from various countries held a total of seven hundred song and dance performances and twenty-one art performances. Many of the outstanding ones were awarded the glorious title of winner of the Sixth World Youth Festival. People will deeply remember the night of the Genius Youth Festival, on the stage of the Moscow Grand Theater, the talented young artists from various countries shone like stars, and hundreds of flowers bloomed. Whether it was the Soviet ballet "The Stone Flower," or the "Peacock Dance" and "Dragon Dance" from China, whether it was the Korean "Oriental Dance," or the Egyptian folk dance, whether it was the solo by the Japanese singer, or the chorus by the Bulgarian singers, all made people feel that the artistic genius of the younger generation is so valuable, they are the promoters of human culture. At the same time, it also makes people feel that in order to maintain human culture, in order to enable these young artists to better exert their talents in a peaceful environment, they must fight for peace unremittingly.
    The half-month festival is just like the good weather in Moscow, it is a sunny day. In these beautiful days, the seeds of peace and friendship have sprouted. "Young people should cherish every grain of peace cultivated in the festival and bring the seeds of peace to all parts of the world." The words of the famous Indian film actor Raj Kapoorton just show the wishes of the festival participants. A joyful festival of youth has ended, and a new day of struggle for peace and friendship has begun. The young representatives of various countries will leave this city of friendship, Moscow, with the seeds of peace from the festival, and scatter them to the lands of the five continents.
                  (August 12)

### 把和平的种子散播到五大洲去

    把和平的种子散播到五大洲去
    本报记者　程光锐
    8月11日傍晚，在美好的联欢节就要结束的时候，在就要和来自各国的青年朋友们分离的时候，莫斯科市民们再一次集聚到“幸福路”上来，再一次拦住青年客人们的汽车，和他们握手，和他们交换纪念品，半个月的欢聚在他们之间产生了亲密的友谊，以致于在分离的时刻是那样地别情依依。“再见，再见！”“一路平安！”“和平，友谊！”……“幸福路”上响起了一片欢呼。
    列宁中央运动场成了欢腾的海洋。晚上九点半钟第六届联欢节闭幕式开始了，请听联欢节国际委员会的庄严声明：“我们争取和平的意志比原子弹更强大。我们要求幸福的愿望是不可抑制的。……只要各国人民、各国青年如同我们在这次联欢节上一样始终友好地相处，就能够建立和平和幸福的未来。各国人民和各国青年之间的友谊是和平的保障。”——这是联欢节的生动的结论，这是一百三十一个国家三万四千个青年代表们的心声。
    九点五十分，联欢节宣布闭幕，在中央运动场上空飘扬半个月的联欢节旗帜缓缓下降，一柱柱的焰火像采色喷泉一样升向天空，这时全场电灯突然熄灭，人们眼前出现了一片幻景，运动场上几千个青年女运动员手执火棒，表演集体体操，只见满场星火，时而像波浪翻腾，时而像群星乱飞——这是青年们的青春活力在跳跃，接着，在东面看台上，人们用千万面红绿蓝紫各色的小旗在采色灯光照耀下变换着各国文字的“和平”，变换着“为了和平和友谊”的大字——这是青年们的思想在闪光。
    青春的欢乐节日过去了，这美妙的日子永远留在每个联欢节参加者的记忆中。
    在半月欢聚的日子里，人们感到了最大的幸福，因为他们看到了五十万人的和平大示威，反对使用原子武器，看到了各国青年们围在桌子旁边讨论如何争取欧洲的、亚洲的和全世界的和平问题，他们看到了和平的种子正在青年们的思想里成长。乌克兰姑娘乌拉得列娜·拿尼莱柯在女青年节上说的话意味深长，她说：“每个人对幸福的理解不同，而我们共同的幸福就是和平。”
    在半月欢聚的日子里，人们经历了最大的欢乐，因为他们看到了在代表们的会见中，中国人和美国人谈家常，在团结晚会上欧洲人和非洲人欢乐歌舞，在红场上，在高尔基大街上，每天夜晚都有来自各国的青年们和苏联人谈心，他们看到友谊的蓓蕾正在青年们的思想里开花，南非联邦的女作家菲利斯·阿特曼说：“我虽然来自远方，但是在联欢节上我感觉到像生活在亲人中间一样。”埃及的女代表娜依拉·叶拉布德的话也是感人的，她说：“我将永远记住在这里认识的朋友，他们很多，这是苏联、波兰、突尼斯、朝鲜、法国、保加利亚和其他国家的青年，我们虽然相识不久，但是，我们的心似乎是很久就结在一起。原因很简单，这是因为我们的愿望只有一个：“和平与友谊。”
    在半月欢聚的日子里，人们感到最大的骄傲，因为他们看到了在和平友谊的气氛中，通过了几百次各种会见、讨论会、友谊比赛和个人接触，思想不同的各国青年们进行了广泛的接触、热烈的争论，他们看到了联欢节用事实驳倒了帝国主义分子对联欢节和苏联的诽谤，苏联青年代表团团长谢列平说：“西方国家诽谤联欢节，诽谤苏联，然而，来到我们国家的各国青年朋友们都会看到苏联人是很好的劳动的人民，他们也同各国人民一样生活和恋爱，一样生男育女，苏联人愿意同资本主义国家的人讨论，求同存异，加强友谊。”如果有人不相信谢列平的话，那末，就再请听听美国青年代表阿尔巴拉·贝莉的话：“我回国后若有人问我联欢节给我留下什么最深刻的印象，我将这样回答，苏联人给我们美国人非常好的招待，他们是诚恳而亲切的，青年们不管有什么分歧，也应当经常聚会在一起，在这个意义上，联欢节起了很大的作用，它表明：第一，各国人民都希望和平；第二，尽管观点不同，但是所有的问题，全可以在圆桌上解决，没有必要拿到战场上去；第三，苏联人和美国人一样不需要战争。”
    联欢节也在文化和艺术上给与人们以非常丰富的享受。在联欢节期间，各国青年艺术家们一共举行七百次歌舞会和二十一次艺术表演会，他们中间的许多优秀者都得到了第六届联欢节获奖者的光荣称号，人们会深刻地记得天才青年节那天晚上，在莫斯科大剧院的舞台上各国的天才青年艺术家们像群星闪耀，百花盛开，不论是苏联的芭蕾舞“宝石花”，不论是来自中国的“孔雀舞”和“龙舞”不论是朝鲜的“东方舞”，还是埃及的民间舞，不论是日本歌唱家的独唱，还是保加利亚歌手们的合唱，都使人感到青年一代的艺术天才是那样地可贵，他们是人类文化的发扬者。同时也使人感到为了维护人类的文化，为了使这些青年艺术家们能够在和平的环境中更好地发挥他们的天才，就不能不为和平而斗争不息。
    半个月的联欢节也正像莫斯科好气候一样，是充满阳光的日子，在这些美好的日子里，和平与友谊的种子茁生了。“青年们应当爱护联欢节中培养出来的每一颗和平的麦粒，把和平的种子带到世界各地去。”印度著名电影演员拉治·卡普东的话正表明联欢节参加者的心愿。一个青春的欢乐的节日结束了，一个新的为和平与友谊而斗争的日子又开始了。各国青年代表们将带着联欢节的和平种子离开这个友谊的城市莫斯科，把它们散播到五大洲的土地上去。
