    Intellectuals Need Constant Remolding
    Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    Why do right-wingers attack the Party so rampantly? Many of them say it's because they are "blinded by greed." Then what kind of "greed" has such power? They themselves have confessed that it is to seize the Party's leadership. Being a minister in the central government is not enough, being a deputy minister or vice-principal is even less satisfying; they must strive to become vice-premiers, even premiers and chairmen. They all say they are "officials without power," "unable to be masters of their own affairs," and "underutilized." They consider themselves to be the most outstanding "great intellectuals" in China, but they have not been appreciated by the people and the Party. Therefore, they want to oppose the Party and the people, wanting to ride on the people's heads and issue orders. The root cause of these right-wingers is naturally their deeply ingrained bourgeois ideology, consistently hostile to socialism and yearning for capitalism. However, judging from the above-mentioned statements of the right-wingers, they also have a common problem, that is, arrogance and selfishness, with the view that "the world does not belong to others but to me." Although we should distinguish right-wingers from the broad masses of intellectuals and never treat them as equals, arrogance and selfishness are also problems of intellectuals, not exclusive to right-wingers. On this point, every intellectual should reflect carefully. Originally, in the old society, knowing a few words seemed to have unexpected magic, and "scholars" were remarkable. At that time, the emperors, whether "rustic" or not, had to rely on this group of intellectuals to rule the people. These intellectuals were not many, only a very small part of the national population. More were worthless and could not be accommodated. However, the ruling class had a clever plan; they always increased the number of intellectuals to be slightly more than the number of "officials," so that there would be competition among them, making them wag their tails and beg for favors from above, and obey in every possible way. But among themselves, because there was competition, they had to boast and belittle each other, or promote each other to raise their status. And what about those below, the people trampled under the feet of the rulers? Naturally, they put on an official air, saying things like "the pitiable ignorant masses," and so on. Therefore, it is said that in the old society, the arrogance and selfishness of intellectuals were "occupational diseases." They never put the people in their eyes.
    Since the occupational diseases of intellectuals in the old era have their historical reasons and are deeply ingrained, it is not easy to completely cure these diseases now. Moreover, although our country has basically completed the socialist revolution, the cultural backwardness left to us over hundreds of years cannot be changed immediately. Intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, are still very few, and the situation of "rarity makes things valuable" still exists. This old occupational disease is difficult to cure fundamentally in a day or two. However, if this disease is not cured, it will be very detrimental to our country's socialist cause. The activities of the right-wingers in the past period clearly illustrate this point. Now I would like to talk about things within my personal business scope—scientific research work.
    In our country, all work is carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. Scientific research is naturally the same and must be comprehensively considered in light of the needs of the socialist construction cause. However, among those who do scientific research, many people feel that it is very inconvenient to complete national tasks and carry out work according to plan. They raise the excuse that scientific research cannot be planned, etc. I will not say whether these excuses are justified, but in this regard, they have indeed been deceived by the sweet talk of the right-wingers. I think if we analyze it, we will find that the problem still lies in the old problems of intellectuals, arrogance and selfishness. Why do I say this is again arrogance and selfishness? Because those who raise these excuses are afraid of accepting research tasks. If the government provides all the research conditions such as data and equipment, but they cannot deliver research results by the deadline and cannot complete the task. It seems that this is fear of doing bad work, for the "public," not for the "private." But if you think about it, with the current lack of scientific and technological talents in our country, if those who can do it do not do it, it will inevitably lead to no one doing it, and the scientific research work needed by the country will fall through. Is this for the "public"? Why are these people "afraid" of doing bad work? They are concerned about losing face if they do bad work. Whose face will be lost? They are afraid of losing "their" face. Moreover, if the research is not successful, they will naturally not be able to put on the airs of "I am the greatest." Isn't this still for "private" interests?
    In fact, scientific research work, like other work, is fundamentally incomplete due to arrogance and selfishness. Arrogance and selfishness make it difficult for people to approach the masses, and without approaching the masses, they lose the source of strength. In research work, it is also necessary to have more contact with people, absorb practical experience and knowledge from all aspects, and put forward one's own views to ask everyone for advice and discuss repeatedly. The "everyone" here not only includes those who are more knowledgeable than me and those who are about the same as me, but must also include those who are generally less knowledgeable than me, because "among three people walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher," and good opinions can come from anywhere. Being able to carry out research work in this way can absorb the source of the strength of the masses. That is an inexhaustible source, and with it, even difficult problems can eventually be solved perfectly. But there is a prerequisite for doing this, and that is to put down arrogant and selfish thoughts; because this old problem of intellectuals is a gap between the individual and the masses.
    So, in the end, the problem is simple: it is to make sure not to put oneself in front, but to put oneself behind. The individual is only a member of the collective, and the interests of the individual should be combined with the interests of the collective. Once the individual interests conflict with the collective interests, one must be able to give up individual interests for the sake of collective interests.
    This cultivation goal of "selflessness" is actually not new. Great idealists have proposed it long ago, and it has a history of thousands of years. However, for intellectuals, this ideal has to wait for a certain historical environment before it has the possibility of being universally realized. Our current society is such an environment. Naturally, just having the possibility does not mean that it can be realized spontaneously. It still requires, on the one hand, the encouragement of the people and the Party, and on the other hand, the efforts of intellectuals to study themselves, in order to gradually move towards that lofty goal. Therefore, only through such continuous transformation can intellectuals enter a new society from the old society, and can they truly have the ability to bear the tasks entrusted to them by the country and the people.

    知识分子需要不断的改造
    中国科学院力学研究所所长　钱学森
    为什么右派分子猖狂地向党进攻呢？他们之中有不少人说是“利令智昏”。那么是什么“利”有这样的力量呢？这他们自己也已经招供出来了，是夺取党的领导权。作了中央的部长还不能满足，作了副部长、副校长更不能满足，一定要争取副总理、以至总理、主席。他们都说他们是
  “有职无权”，“不能当家作主”，“大才小用”了。他们自以为是中国最优秀的“大知识分子”，可是没有被人民和党赏识，因此，他们要反党、反人民，想骑到人民的头上发号施令。这些右派分子的病根子自然是他们根深蒂固的资产阶级思想，一贯敌视社会主义向往资本主义，但是从上面所说的右派分子的言论看来，他们也还有一个共同的毛病，那就是自高自大，有“天下不是别人的而是我的”这种看法。虽然我们应该把右派分子和广大知识分子分清，决不能同等看待，可是自高自大，自私自利倒也是知识分子的毛病，非右派分子所专有。在这一点上每一个知识分子都要好好地反省一下。本来么，在旧社会里，认得几个字就好像有意想不到的魔力，“读书人”是了不起的。那时候的皇帝，不管他“土”的还不是“土”的，要统治人民，就得靠这帮知识分子。这些知识分子并不多，只是全国人民中的很小的一部分。多了不值钱，而且也安插不了。但是，统治阶级是有妙算的，他们总把知识分子的数目提到比“官”的数目多一些，让他们之间有竞争，使他们对上是摇尾乞怜，百般依顺；但在他们之间，因为有竞争，那就得自吹自打，或相互标榜以抬高身价。而对下呢，对那些踏在统治者脚下的人民呢，那自然是一副官架子，说什么
  “可怜的愚民”等等。所以说在旧社会里，知识分子的自高自大、自私自利是“职业病”。他们从来也没有把人民放在眼里。
    既然知识分子在旧时代里的职业病有它的历史原因，是根深蒂固的，所以现在要把这病完全治好也不是容易的；何况现在虽然我国已经基本上完成了社会主义革命，但是几百年来遗留给我们的文化落后状况尚不能立刻改变过来，知识分子，特别是高级知识分子还是很少的，“物以稀为贵”的情况仍然存在。这个旧职业病也难于在一朝一日根本治好。但是，如果不治好这个病，对我国社会主义事业是很不利的。过去一个时期右派分子的活动就很清楚地说明了这一点。现在我想就我个人业务范围里的事——科学研究工作谈一谈。
    在我们的国家里，一切工作都是有计划、有步骤地进行的。科学研究自然也是如此，一定要针对着社会主义建设事业的需要，全面考虑。但是，作科学研究的人，其中也有不少人对完成国家任务、依照规划进行工作感到很不方便。他们提出科学研究不能订计划等等的口实。我先不说这些口实是不是有依据，但在这一点上他们确实被右派分子的花言巧语所迷惑过，我想如果分析一下就会发现这里的问题仍在于知识分子的老毛病，自高自大和自私自利。为什么说这又是自高自大、自私自利呢？因为提出这些口实的人，他们是怕把研究任务答应下来，政府也给了一切资料设备等研究条件，而到期交不出研究成果，不能完成任务。看来这是怕工作做坏了，是为“公”，不是为“私”。其实想一想，在我们现在科学技术人材这样缺乏，可以做的人不去做，势必至于无人的，使国家需要的科学研究工作落空，这是不是为“公”呢？这些人为什么“怕”作坏了呢？顾虑的是作坏了丢脸。丢谁的脸呢？怕丢“他的”脸。而且如果研究不成功自然也就不能搭出“老子天下第一”的架子。这还不是为“私”吗？
    其实，科学研究工作和其他工作一样，完不成的根本原因还是自高自大、自私自利，而自高自大、自私自利就使得人难于接近群众，不接近群众就丧失了力量的泉源。在研究工作里，也是要多多和人接触，吸取各方面的实践经验和知识，把自己的看法提出来向大家请教，反复讨论。这里说的大家不但包括学识比本人高的和同本人差不多的，也必得包括学识一般不如我的，因为“三人行必有我师”，好的意见从那儿都能来。能这样来进行研究工作，就能吸取群众力量的泉源。那是不尽的泉源，有了它就是困难的问题也能终于得到完满的解决。但是要这样作是有一个先决条件的，那就是放下自高自大、自私自利的想法；因为这个知识分子的旧毛病是个人和群众之间的鸿沟。
    所以说到了，问题毕竟是简单的，就是要作到不要把自己放在前面，而是要把自己放在后面。个人只不过是集体的一分子，应该把个人的利益和集体的利益相结合起来，而一旦遇到个人利益和集体利益相冲突的时候，要能为集体利益而放弃个人利益。
    这个“大公无私”的修养目的，其实也不是新的，伟大的理想者早就提出了，已有几千年的历史了。但是对知识分子来说，这个理想要等待到一定的历史环境才有普遍实现的可能。我们现在的社会就是这样的环境。自然，光是有可能还不等于就能自流地实现，还是要一方面靠人民和党的鞭策，另一面要靠知识分子自身的努力学习，才能逐步地走向那崇高的目标。所以只有通过这样的不断改造，知识分子才能从旧社会进入新社会，才能真正有能力负担起国家人民交给的任务。
