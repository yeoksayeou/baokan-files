A Major Progress in the Anti-Rightist Struggle in Literary and Art Circles
    Cracking the Ding Ling-Chen Qixia Anti-Party Clique

    (Our Newspaper dispatch) A struggle is underway in literary and art circles to oppose the anti-Party activities of Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and others, to safeguard the socialist literary and art cause, and to maintain unity within literary and art circles.

    The Party leadership group of the Chinese Writers Association successively held twelve expanded meetings from June 6 to August 6. From July 25, the scope of the meeting was further expanded, with more than two hundred Party and non-Party writers and literary and art workers participating. The meeting exposed the activities of the anti-Party clique headed by Ding Ling.

    In the first, second, and third meetings, Ding Ling and Chen Qixia, taking advantage of the bourgeois Rightists' rampant attacks on the Party and the government, launched new attacks on the Party. They attempted to overturn the investigation of the "Literary Gazette's" bourgeois orientation conducted by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Writers Association in 1954, as well as the conclusions made by the Party leadership group of the Writers Association in 1955 regarding the anti-Party activities of Ding Ling and Chen Qixia. They denied the achievements of the Writers Association's purge of counter-revolutionaries and incited the reversal of verdicts. Through prior arrangements and instigation at the meetings, they influenced some of the attendees to launch rampant attacks on the Party and openly clamored to investigate the "responsibility" for the meeting held in 1955 to struggle against them.

    After the third meeting, in the anti-Rightist struggle, the Tianjin branch of the Chinese Writers Association criticized the anti-Party words and deeds of Liu Xi, who had close ties with Chen Qixia. Liu Xi confessed to the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China some of the crimes of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique, allowing this anti-Party conspiracy to be further exposed.

    From the fourth meeting onward, everyone exposed their conspiracy. Many speakers elaborated on the necessity of the 1955 struggle against the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique based on the nature of Ding Ling and Chen Qixia's mistakes, and, in connection with Liu Xi's confession, further exposed their recent series of even more rampant anti-Party activities.

Why Did the Writers Association's Party Organization Criticize Ding Ling and Chen Qixia in 1955?

    The 1955 struggle began with three anonymous letters. In April 1955, Chen Qixia wrote three anonymous letters to responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee, slandering the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party organization of the Writers Association, demanding the overturning of the investigative conclusion on the "Literary Gazette." Prior to this, after the launch of the criticism of "Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber," the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles had conducted an investigation of the "Literary Gazette," criticizing its errors of surrendering to bourgeois literary and artistic thought and adopting a aristocratic master-like attitude toward Marxist new forces. The Party organization of the Writers Association also gave Chen Qixia a disciplinary warning due to his stubborn resistance to criticism. In the anonymous letters, Chen Qixia fabricated facts, saying that the investigation of the "Literary Gazette" was "suppression" and "using public office for private gain." He slandered the Party organization of the Writers Association as "destroying democracy" and "fabricating charges." Although many people pointed out that the anonymous letters were very likely written by Chen Qixia, he still flatly denied it and even slandered the Party for wronging good people. It was not until the tenth meeting on August 3 this year, two years later, that Chen Qixia confessed that he had written all three anonymous letters himself.

    The 1955 meeting of the Party leadership group proceeded from investigating the anonymous letters to exposing the anti-Party clique activities of Ding Ling and Chen Qixia. The meeting exposed Ding Ling's long-standing serious bourgeois individualist thought and anti-Party sentiments. This ideological sentiment has its historical roots. In 1933, after Ding Ling was arrested in Shanghai by Kuomintang secret agents, she defected in Nanjing, a fact she had concealed from the Party for a long time. In 1942, when Ding Ling was the editor of the literary section of the "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an, she published her own "Thoughts on March 8th" and Trotskyist Wang Shiwei's "Wild Lilies," which viciously slandered the Party and the revolution during the most difficult time of the War of Resistance Against Japan. These articles were immediately used by the Kuomintang as anti-communist propaganda materials. After the national liberation, Ding Ling held important responsibilities in literary and art circles, but she developed even more serious arrogance, complacency, and desires for personal power. She colluded with Chen Qixia, and with them as the center, formed an anti-Party force. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique once believed that Ding Ling was a "powerful figure" who could be won over for "cooperation."

    The Ding Ling-Chen Qixia clique carried out a series of anti-Party activities in literary and art circles. They had long refused the Party's leadership and supervision, and the "Literary Gazette" under their control became an independent kingdom. Ding Ling also tried her best to expand her personal influence and cultivate her personal forces during her tenure as the head of the Literature Institute. After the Central Committee investigated the "Literary Gazette," Chen Qixia slandered the Party Central Committee, saying it was "Wu Sangui borrowing troops" (meaning borrowing Hu Feng's hand to criticize the "Literary Gazette," Wu Sangui referring to the Party). Ding Ling believed that the investigation of the "Literary Gazette" was the "Literary Gazette's" "misfortune" and was "targeting" Ding Ling and Chen Qixia. Chen Qixia said with hatred: "I have a pistol with seven bullets. I'll save the last one to shoot myself." At the Party meetings, when many people criticized Chen Qixia, Ding Ling tried her best to defend and exonerate him, arousing everyone's dissatisfaction. For a long time, they violated Party principles, carried out small clique activities behind the Party organization's back. They always wooed those who were backward or dissatisfied with the Party to expand their forces. They often spread rumors, created discord, and undermined unity. They also promoted personality cults and spread decadent bourgeois individualist ideas among literary and art circles and young people. Ding Ling adopted a sectarian and exclusionary attitude toward some accomplished writers inside and outside the Party, believing that they were not that great. She also spread the idea of "one book-ism" among young authors, saying: "As long as a person writes a book, no one can bring him down." Chen Qixia promoted the anti-Party idea of "a scholar dies for his confidant" among the staff of the "Literary Gazette" editorial department.

    The 1955 expanded meeting of the Party leadership group conducted serious criticism and struggle against Ding and Chen's anti-Party words and deeds, pointing out that Ding and Chen's anti-Party activities were mainly manifested in: 1. Refusing the Party's leadership and supervision, violating the Party's guidelines, policies, and instructions; 2. Violating Party principles, engaging in emotional manipulation to expand the influence of the anti-Party clique; 3. Playing double-dealing tactics, sowing discord, and undermining Party unity; 4. Promoting personality cults and spreading bourgeois individualist ideas. However, in the past two years, not only have they failed to learn from this, recognize and correct their mistakes, but they have continued to carry out anti-Party activities.

Taking Advantage of the International Anti-Communist Wave to Make a More Intense Comeback

    After the Hungarian incident occurred last October, an anti-communist wave appeared internationally, and some people in the country were also affected. Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and others believed that the time had come to counterattack the Party and actively prepared to make a comeback. Chen Qixia said: "The current atmosphere is favorable to us!"

    They first slandered the purge of counter-revolutionaries, spreading alarming rumors everywhere. Chen Qixia said that the Writers Association's gains in the purge of counter-revolutionaries were "the charcoal left after burning the house." When others refuted him, he said even more arrogantly: "I want to correct it: what's left is not even big charcoal, but small charcoal." They said that the Party's struggle against Ding and Chen was "sectarianism," "political persecution," "deceiving superiors and deceiving subordinates," and "violating laws and discipline." Ding Ling even proposed at the meeting to investigate the records of the meeting of the Minister's Office of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and questioned what the nature of the Minister's Office meeting was and whether it could represent the Central Committee.

    According to revelations at the meeting: Ding Ling had been active everywhere, inquiring about the situation, looking for exploitable errors and shortcomings, instigating, and creating an atmosphere favorable to them. Ding Ling told people everywhere that she was a "poor peasant," meaning that she was an oppressed person within the Party, in order to deceive people into sympathizing with her and inciting people's resentment against the Party, so as to force the Party to yield to them, attempting to achieve the goal of completely reversing the verdict. Chen Qixia also went to encourage some people who had been investigated in the purge of counter-revolutionaries to demand a reversal of the verdict from the organization. Chen Qixia first used emotional relationships and despicable means to force Liu Xi (female, Party member), a screenwriter at the Film Script Creation Studio, to collude in creating fake letters to deceive the Party in order to overturn Liu Xi's confession in the purge of counter-revolutionaries regarding Chen Qixia, as a basis for Chen Qixia's reversal of the verdict.

    During this period, some people in literary and art circles even described Chen Qixia as a "hero" against the purge of counter-revolutionaries.

Coordinating with the Rightists' Rampant Attacks and Colluding with Wenhui News in a Deplorable Fashion

    This spring, after the rectification campaign began, bourgeois Rightists launched rampant attacks on the Party. The Ding-Chen clique also took advantage of this situation to attack the Party from both inside and outside.

    At that time, Liu Xi had decided to transfer to work at the Tianjin branch of the Writers Association. Chen Qixia said to Liu Xi: "Don't go. The current situation is just right. Don't write novels now. Write essays to cooperate with the movement." Thus, two essays by Liu Xi appeared in the June issue of "Beijing Literature": one was "A Metamorphosis," attacking the Party's leadership in literary and art circles, describing the Party as a group of fickle people; the other was "There Should Be Such a Law," describing the entire literary and art circles as filled with gloomy and chilling atmosphere. According to Liu Xi's confession: these two essays were discussed with Chen Qixia before and after, and even the main language was Chen Qixia's. Chen Qixia also told Liu Xi to set fires at the Film Bureau and the "Literary Gazette" editorial department.

    After the counterattack against the Rightists began, on June 10, Liu Xi went to the Tianjin Writers Association to "avoid the storm." At this time, the comrades of the Tianjin Writers Association criticized Liu Xi's two essays. On June 24, Liu Xi came to Beijing again and met with Chen Qixia at the home of Sun Yuchun, a Rightist element in the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles. At that time, Sun Yuchun said: "The Federation of Literary and Art Circles is going to treat me as a Rightist." Chen Qixia laughed and said after hearing this: "Rightist is rightist!" and also said: "You are not a Party member, you don't have to attend the meeting!"

    During the period of great airing of views, Chen Qixia asked Liu Xi to go to the Beijing office of "Wenhui News" to ask the newspaper to send a reporter to interview Ding Ling, and said to Liu Xi: "Ding Ling will definitely not speak, indicating that she wants to ask the Party leadership group for instructions, to see how they respond." and also said: "If they don't let her speak, then it will be easy." Liu Xi went to find Yao Fangzao, a reporter from "Wenhui News," not only asking them to interview Ding and Chen, but also revealing the so-called "inside story" of the Ding and Chen issue to Yao Fangzao, telling her not to tell it to others, and asking whether there were any Party members in the Beijing office of "Wenhui News." Yao Fangzao said: "There is one, he's a worker, it doesn't matter, he doesn't understand. Don't worry, I will never betray a friend."

    At the end of May, after Chen Qixia viciously attacked the purge of counter-revolutionaries at a rectification meeting of the Writers Association, he excitedly met with Liu Xi at the Temple of Heaven, not even bothering to eat. The first thing he said upon meeting was: "This is great, the situation has opened up!" He revealed the situation at the meeting to Liu Xi and told Liu Xi: "The meeting is very tense, why doesn't 'Wenhui News' send a reporter?" Tell them to send someone!" Liu Xi went to the "Wenhui News" office and found Yao Fangzao. Yao Fangzao immediately called Guo Xiaochuan, the deputy secretary of the Party leadership group of the Writers Association, requesting to participate in the Party leadership group meeting to discuss the Ding and Chen issue. After Guo Xiaochuan refused, Yao Fangzao said: "If you refuse, we will publish it in the newspaper! This is closed-door rectification!" and immediately threatened: "We are going to publish an article 'Why Have Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng Been Silent in Recent Years?'"

    Throughout the entire time of the phone call, Liu Xi sat opposite Yao Fangzao, helping her with wording.

    On June 6, Yao Fangzao wrote a provocative article "Whispers of Writers," preparing to publish it in "Wenhui News." In this article, she portrayed literary and art circles as gloomy and bleak. She wanted to take the opportunity to publicly report the issue of the Writers Association Party leadership group's criticism of Ding and Chen in 1955.

    On June 7, Pu Xixiu and Yao Fangzao visited Ding Ling according to plan. Pu Xixiu said to Ding Ling: "The walls of literary and art circles are very difficult to break through." Asking Ding Ling what mysteries there were in literary and art circles? How she viewed her own problems? Ding Ling avoided answering these questions, saying: "Go ask Shao Quanlin, their Party leadership group knows." Ding Ling's husband, Chen Ming, said from the side: "You have mobilized the poor peasants." Pu Xixiu and Yao Fangzao immediately found Shao Quanlin and demanded that the Ding and Chen issue be published in the newspaper. Shao Quanlin refused this provocative request.

    The meeting revealed: During the period when "Wenhui News" was setting fires everywhere, Li Youran also participated in Ding and Chen's attack on the Party. Li Youran even嚣张 to the point of proposing to review the Party membership of Liu Baiyu, the deputy secretary of the Party leadership group, and openly called on others at the Party meeting to "rebel" against them. Ai Qing also spread some anti-Party remarks and activity news for Ding Ling and others. Ai Qing told the "Wenhui News" reporter about the so-called "two bottoms of literary and art circles," slandering the Party's criticism of Ding, Chen, and Jiang Feng's mistakes as "sectarianism within the Party," he said: "The rights and wrongs in literary and art circles are unclear, one group is specialized in 整人 (persecuting people), and one group is specialized in being 挨整 (persecuted)." using this to provoke "Wenhui News" to attack literary and art circles.

    At the same time, Tang Yin and Tang Dacheng of the "Literary Gazette" editorial department also proposed to publicly discuss the Ding and Chen issue again.

Ding and Chen Planned to Withdraw from the Writers Association in an Attempt to Publicly Split Literary and Art Circles

    Another vicious conspiracy of the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique revealed at the meeting was their attempt to publicly split literary and art circles. According to Liu Xi's revelation and Chen Qixia's confession: Ding Ling and Chen Qixia had jointly plotted to launch a major attack on the Party at the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Circles Representatives, which was scheduled to be held in October this year, and if it failed, they would publicly create a split. According to Ge Wen's revelation, Ding Ling had said to her that she would publish a statement in the newspaper, publicly withdrawing from the Chinese Writers Association. Chen Qixia also confessed that he would publish an article "Farewell to Literary and Art Circles" in the newspaper and also withdraw from the Writers Association.

    The reason why Ding Ling and Chen Qixia were preparing to do this was to create a situation to threaten the Party and force the Party to yield to them. It was precisely for such a purpose that Chen Qixia also wanted to start a publication during the period of great airing of views, with the aim of defeating the "Literary Gazette." Within the "Literary Gazette," Tang Yin, Tang Dacheng, and others, who were previously Chen Qixia's confidants, not only used their positions to try to turn the "Literary Gazette" into a bourgeois "free forum," taking the path of "Wenhui News," but also coordinated with Ding and Chen within the "Literary Gazette," attacking the Party's leadership and attacking the Party's literary and art guidelines, attempting to overturn the conclusion of the investigation of the "Literary Gazette's" errors two years ago. Tang Yin, Tang Dacheng, and others also secretly plotted to publish a "circle journal" with literary criticism as its main content behind the Party's back. This secret plan to organize a circle journal also received support from Feng Xuefeng. Chen Yong was also one of the conspirators of this journal. He planned to resign from his position as a member of the editorial board of the "Literary Gazette." He believed that the eve of "great change" had arrived. They also planned to have Ding Ling, Liu Binyan, and others participate. They told Mei Duo of "Wenhui News" about this secret plan, but agreed to conceal it from the Party. Tang Yin, Tang Dacheng, and others were also prepared to withdraw from the "Literary Gazette" if the circle journal could not be established.

    All their shady conspiratorial activities were carried out in a hidden manner behind the Party organization's back. They had also repeatedly formed alliances of offense and defense, attempting to deny everything to the Party to the end.

    When someone began to counterattack Ding, Chen, and others' attacks at the first three meetings at the fourth expanded meeting of the Party leadership group on July 25, Ding, Chen, and others became alarmed. They secretly discussed what attitude to take to deal with this counterattack. The secret consultations between Ding and Chen mostly went through Chen Ming (Party member). Chen Ming told Chen Qixia: Ding Ling was prepared to "accept adversity." Chen Qixia said: "I don't agree. I'm prepared for a full-scale attack." During this meeting, they formed an alliance of offense and defense. Chen Ming said: "If you are questioned about your relationship with Ding Ling, you can postpone the date of your previous meeting with Ding Ling by one day, and say that we accidentally met after coming out of Shao Quanlin's place. You must enter my house, and we only talked about the play and the works, and nothing else." Chen Ming also wanted Chen Qixia to tell Zheng Zhong (Chen Qixia's wife) not to talk about their previous meeting. Chen Ming and Chen Qixia's contacts often took secret forms, such as not giving their real names when making phone calls, meeting on the street, and arranging for Chen Qixia to talk to Ding Ling at Ding Ling's house when one of Ding Ling's civil servant (Communist Youth League member) at her house was going to night school. Chen Qixia and Liu Xi also used pseudonyms to communicate or sent "booklets," writing a few words in the gaps of magazines in a mysterious way to transmit messages.

    Before the seventh expanded meeting of the Party leadership group convened on July 30, Chen Qixia called Chen Ming and asked: "What should we do?" Chen Ming was very flustered and said: "We can make a self-criticism, but the things we said (referring to the alliance of offense and defense) will still be the same." At this Party leadership group meeting, Ding Ling and Chen Qixia indeed denied and quibbled. It was not until the tenth meeting on August 3 that Chen Qixia began to change, confessing some of the facts of his and Ding Ling's conspiracy. Chen Qixia said: "I have been opposing the Party with Ding Ling for a long time. Although we haven't met much recently, we understand each other implicitly. In any occasion, a gesture, a look, a word, we can all understand what it means."

The Anti-Party Clique Begins to Collapse. Ding Ling and Chen Ming Continue to Resist Stubbornly.

    The expanded meeting of the Party leadership group was presided over by Shao Quanlin, vice chairman of the Writers Association and secretary of the Party leadership group of the Writers Association. Zhou Yang, deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Li Zhilian, secretary of the Party Committee of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, attended the meeting and delivered speeches. They pointed out that this was an extremely important struggle with a high degree of principle in literary and art circles. Mao Dun, chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, and Xu Guangping, a famous social activist and Lu Xun's wife, also spoke at the meeting. They believed that this meeting was of great educational significance and pointed out the error of Ding Ling's serious individualism, hoping that she would repent. Mao Dun said that Ding Ling still had the shadow of "Miss Sophie" on her. (Note: Ding Ling's debut work is called "Miss Sophie's Diary," published in 1927. "Miss Sophie" is the protagonist of this work, a woman who specializes in manipulating men to achieve selfish purposes.) Xu Guangping said that Ding Ling's current behavior was very similar to Yang Yinyu, the principal of the Women's Normal University, whom Lu Xun had opposed more than thirty years ago. Liu Baiyu, Lin Mohan, Zhang Tianyi, Sha Ting, Ai Wu, Fang Ji, Cao Yu, Tian Jian, Guo Xiaochuan, Wei Wei (representing the seventeen military writers attending the meeting), Kang Zhuo, Xing Ye, Yan Chen, Lu Fei, and other forty-seven people spoke at the meeting successively. Liu Baiyu made a systematic exposure and analysis of the anti-Party activities of Ding Ling and others, and also made a review of some of the errors and shortcomings of the Writers Association's purge of counter-revolutionaries and the struggle against Ding and Chen in 1955. Other speakers also warmly supported and supported this struggle to safeguard the socialist literary and art cause and the Party's principles.

    The meeting adopted a factual and reasoned approach, which transformed the anti-Party element Chen Qixia from quibbling to beginning to confess. With the help of the Party leadership group and the comrades present, and under Liu Xi's accusation and exposure, Chen Qixia had no choice but to make a preliminary confession of his serious crimes and expressed his determination to repent and start anew. Chen Qixia also used facts to illustrate Ding Ling's ambition to usurp the leadership of literary and art circles, and at the same time revealed Feng Xuefeng's remarks expressing support for his anti-Party activities, and some other anti-Party remarks. Ding Ling made four speeches before and after, first launching a rampant attack on the Party, demanding a reversal of the verdict, and after the attack failed, she pretended to make a self-criticism, on the one hand, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial, making all kinds of denials, and on the other hand, pretending to be very wronged, saying that her anti-Party behavior was only an opinion on some Party leaders in literary and art circles, in order to try to win the sympathy of some people. Chen Ming, on the other hand, tried his best to exonerate and quibble for Ding Ling, without making any confessions himself.

    Feng Xuefeng made a preliminary self-criticism, admitting that he had serious individualism and anti-Party sentiments, and admitting that his literary and art thought was in conflict with the Party's and Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and art thought.

    Ai Qing also initially admitted his mistakes and revealed some of Ding Ling's anti-Party words and deeds.

    Those attending the meeting unanimously believed that the meeting was of great educational significance, and this was a struggle of socialist thought against bourgeois thought in literary and art circles, and a struggle between the Party's line and the anti-Party line: the Ding-Chen clique, if calculated from 1942, had existed for fifteen years, and the struggle against this anti-Party clique had only achieved preliminary victory. Everyone expressed sympathy and support for Liu Xi's confession and her accusation against Chen Qixia, and also welcomed Chen Qixia's beginning to admit his guilt, hoping that they and others related to this clique would continue to confess to the Party. The meeting unanimously expressed indignation at Ding Ling, Chen Ming, and others' continued stubborn resistance, and ordered them to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly confess the facts of their criminal activities.

    The expanded meeting of the Party leadership group is still continuing.

### 文艺界反右派斗争的重大进展  攻破丁玲陈企霞反党集团

    文艺界反右派斗争的重大进展
    攻破丁玲陈企霞反党集团
    本报讯　文艺界正在进行一场反对丁玲、陈企霞等人的反党活动、维护社会主义文艺事业和维护文艺界的团结的斗争。
    中国作家协会党组从6月6日到8月6日陆续举行了十二次扩大会议。从7月25日起，会议范围进一步扩大，参加会议的有党和非党的作家及文艺工作者二百多人。会上揭发了以丁玲为首的反党小集团的活动。
    在第一、二、三次会议上，丁玲、陈企霞利用资产阶级右派向党和政府猖狂进攻的时机，对党发动了新的进攻。他们企图推翻中共中央宣传部和中国文联、中国作协在1954年对“文艺报”的资产阶级方向的检查，以及作协党组在1955年对丁玲、陈企霞反党活动所作的结论。他们否定作协肃反成绩，并煽动翻案。他们通过事前的布置和在会议上的煽动，影响了一部分会议的出席人，向党猖狂进攻，并公然叫嚣要追究1955年开会斗争他们的“责任”。
    在第三次会议以后，中国作家协会天津分会在反右派斗争中，批判了与陈企霞有密切关系的柳溪的反党言行，柳溪向中共天津市委宣传部坦白交代了丁、陈反党集团的一些罪行，使这一个反党阴谋得以进一步暴露。
    从第四次会议起，大家揭露了他们的阴谋，许多发言者都从丁玲、陈企霞错误的性质，阐明1955年反对丁、陈反党集团的斗争的必要性，并联系柳溪的交代，进一步揭发了他们最近一连串更猖狂的反党活动。1955年作协党组织为什么批评丁玲陈企霞
    1955年的斗争，是从三封匿名信开始的。在1955年4月，陈企霞写了三封匿名信给党中央负责同志，污蔑中共中央宣传部和作协党组织，要求推翻对“文艺报”的检查结论。在此以前，中共中央宣传部和中国文联曾在对“红楼梦研究”的批判开展以后，对“文艺报”进行检查，批评了“文艺报”的向资产阶级文艺思想投降和对马克思主义新生力量采取贵族老爷式态度的错误。作协党的组织并针对陈企霞顽强抗拒批评的态度给他以党纪处分。陈企霞在匿名信里捏造了事实，说检查“文艺报”是“打击压制”，“假公济私”。他诬蔑作协的党组织“摧残民主”、“无中生有”。尽管许多人指出匿名信有很大可能是陈企霞写的，但他仍矢口否认，还污蔑党冤枉好人。直到今年8月3日第十次会议上，在事隔两年之后，陈企霞才坦白交代出三封匿名信都是他自己写的。
    1955年的党组会从追查匿名信进而揭露了丁玲、陈企霞的反党小集团活动。会上揭露了丁玲长期存在严重的资产阶级个人主义思想和反党情绪。这种思想情绪有它的历史根源。1933年丁玲在上海被国民党特务逮捕以后，曾经在南京变节，这件事她曾长期对党隐瞒。1942年丁玲在延安担任“解放日报”文艺版主编，曾经发表了她自己写的“三八节有感”，和托派分子王实味写的“野百合花”，在抗日战争最困难的时候，对党、对革命进行了恶毒的诽谤。这些文章旋即被国民党用来作为反共的宣传材料。全国解放以后，丁玲身负文艺界的重责，但却滋长了更加严重的骄傲自满和个人权力欲望，她与陈企霞勾结在一起，并以他们两人为中心，结成了一股反党势力。胡风反革命集团曾经认为丁玲是可以争取“合作”的“实力派”。
    丁玲、陈企霞集团在文艺界进行了一系列的反党活动。他们长期以来拒绝党的领导和监督，在他们把持下的“文艺报”成了独立王国。丁玲并在她主持文学讲习所期间极力扩大个人影响，培植私人势力。在中央检查“文艺报”后，陈企霞诬蔑党中央说这是“吴三桂借兵”（意即借胡风的手来批评“文艺报”，吴三桂就是指党）。丁玲认为检查“文艺报”是“文艺报”“倒霉”，是“整”丁玲和陈企霞；陈企霞则充满仇恨地说：“我有一支手枪，有七粒子弹，留最后一粒打死自己。”在党的会议上许多人批评陈企霞的时候，丁玲竭力替陈辩解、开脱，激起了大家的不满。长期以来他们违反党的原则，背着党的组织，进行小集团活动。他们总是拉拢那些落后的，或对党不满的人，扩大他们的势力。他们经常散布流言蜚语，制造不和，破坏团结。他们还提倡个人崇拜，在文艺界和青年中散播资产阶级腐朽的个人主义思想。丁玲对党内外一些有成就的作家采取宗派主义的排斥的态度，认为他们没有什么了不起。她还在青年作者中散布“一本书主义”的思想，她说：“一个人只要写出一本书来，就谁也打他不倒。”陈企霞则在“文艺报”编辑部人员中提倡“士为知己者死”的反党思想。
    1955年的党组扩大会对丁、陈的反党言行，作了严肃的批判和斗争，指出丁、陈的反党活动，主要表现在：一，拒绝党的领导和监督，违抗党的方针、政策和指示；二，违反党的原则，进行感情拉拢，以扩大反党小集团的势力；三，玩弄两面派的手法，挑拨离间，破坏党的团结；四，提倡个人崇拜，散播资产阶级个人主义思想。但是两年来他们不仅没有从此吸取教训，认识和改正自己的错误，反而继续进行反党活动。利用国际反共浪潮变本加厉卷土重来
    去年10月，匈牙利事件发生后，国际上出现了一股反共浪潮，国内一部分人也受到影响。丁玲、陈企霞等认为向党反扑的时机已到，便积极准备卷土重来。陈企霞说：“现在的空气对我们有利！”
    他们首先诬蔑肃反运动，到处散布耸人听闻的谰言。陈企霞说作协肃反的收获是“烧了房子剩下的木炭。”当别人反驳他的时候，他更狂妄地说：“我要更正：剩下的还不是大木炭，而是小木炭。”他们说党对丁、陈的斗争，是“宗派主义”，是“政治陷害”，是“瞒上欺下”，是“违法乱纪”。丁玲甚至在会上提出要追查中共中央宣传部部长办公会议的记录，并质问部长办公会议是什么性质，能否代表中央。
    根据会上的揭露：丁玲曾四处活动，打听情况，寻找可以利用的错误和缺点，进行煽动，制造对他们有利的空气。丁玲到处对人说，她自己是“贫雇农”，意思是：在党内她是被压迫者，借以骗取人们对她的同情，和煽起人们对党的反感，以便逼使党向他们屈服，企图达到完全翻案的目的。陈企霞也去鼓动一些肃反中被审查的人，向组织要求翻案。陈企霞首先用感情关系和卑鄙手段迫使电影剧本创作所的编剧柳溪（女，党员），共谋制造假信，向党进行欺骗，以推翻柳溪在肃反中交代的有关陈企霞的材料，作为陈企霞翻案的张本。
    在这期间，文艺界有人竟把陈企霞说成是反对肃反运动的“英雄”。配合右派的猖狂进攻勾结文汇报狼狈为奸
    今年春天，整风开始后，资产阶级右派分子向党猖狂进攻。丁、陈集团也利用了这一形势，里应外合向党实行攻击。
    当时柳溪已决定调作家协会天津分会工作，陈企霞对柳溪说：“不要走，现在局面正好，你现在不要写小说啦，写写杂文，配合运动。”于是“北京文艺”六月号上便出现了柳溪的两篇杂文：一篇是“摇身一变”，攻击文艺界党的领导，把党说成是一群反复无常的人；一篇是“要有这样一条法律”，把整个文艺界描写得阴风惨惨。据柳溪交代：这两篇杂文事先事后都和陈企霞商议过，连主要的语言都是陈企霞的。陈企霞还叫柳溪到电影局和“文艺报”编辑部去放火。
    反击右派开始后，6月10日，柳溪到作协天津分会去“躲风”。这时，天津作协的同志们对柳溪的两篇杂文进行批评。6月24日，柳溪又到北京来，在北京文联的右派分子孙毓椿家中和陈企霞见面。当时孙毓椿说：“文联要把我当右派了。”陈企霞听后哈哈大笑，说：“右派就右派！”又说：“你又不是党员，可以不参加会嘛！”
    大鸣大放期间，陈企霞要柳溪去“文汇报”北京办事处，请该报派记者去访问丁玲，并对柳溪说：“丁玲一定不会讲话，表示要请示党组，看他们怎么答复。”又说：“他们不让讲，那就好办了。”柳溪去找“文汇报”的记者姚芳藻，不但要他们去访问丁、陈，并把丁、陈问题的所谓“内幕”泄露给姚芳藻，叫姚不要讲出去，并问“文汇报”北京办事处是否有党员，姚芳藻说：“有一个，是工友，不要紧，他不懂。你放心好了，我决不出卖朋友。”
    5月底，在作协一次整风的会议上，陈企霞恶毒地攻击了肃反运动以后，便兴冲冲地饭也顾不得吃，到天坛去和柳溪见面。见面第一句话便说：“这一下可好了，局面打开了！”向柳溪泄露了会上的情形，并告诉柳溪：“会开得很紧张，为什么‘文汇报’不来记者？”要他们派人来！”柳溪便去“文汇报”办事处找了姚芳藻，姚芳藻立即打电话给作协党组副书记郭小川，要求参加讨论丁、陈问题的党组会议。郭小川拒绝后，姚芳藻说：“你拒绝，我们要给你们登报！这是关门整风！”又马上威胁地说：“我们要发表一篇‘丁玲、冯雪峰为什么这几年沉默了？’的文章。”
    在打电话的整个时间内，柳溪坐在姚芳藻的对面，帮她提词。
    6月6日，姚芳藻写成了一篇挑拨性的文章“作家们的窃窃私语”，准备在“文汇报”发表。她在这篇文章中，把文艺界描绘成阴森惨淡。她想趁机将1955年作协党组批判丁、陈的问题公开报道出来。
    6月7日，浦熙修和姚芳藻按照计划去访问丁玲。浦熙修对丁玲说：“文艺界的墙很难闯。”问丁玲文艺界有什么谜？对她自己的问题怎么看法？丁玲果然对这些问题避而不答，丁玲说：“你们去问邵荃麟，他们党组知道。”丁玲的丈夫陈明并在一旁说：“你们发动贫雇农来了。”浦熙修和姚芳藻果然立刻找了邵荃麟，要求在报上公布丁、陈问题。邵荃麟拒绝了这种挑衅性的要求。
    会上揭露：在“文汇报”到处点火期间，李又然也参加了丁、陈向党的进攻，李又然甚至嚣张到提出要审查党组副书记刘白羽的党籍，并公开在党的会议上号召别人向他们“起义”。艾青也为丁玲等传播了一些反党言论和活动消息。艾青曾告诉“文汇报”记者所谓“文艺界的两个底”，诬蔑党批评丁、陈和江丰的错误是“党内的宗派主义”，他说：“文艺界是非不清，一批是专整人的，一批是专挨整的。”以此去挑动“文汇报”向文艺界进攻。
    与此同时，“文艺报”编辑部的唐因、唐达成等也提出要重新公开讨论丁、陈问题。丁、陈曾准备退出作协企图公开分裂文艺界
    会上揭露的丁、陈反党集团的另一毒辣阴谋，就是他们企图公开分裂文艺界。据柳溪揭发和陈企霞交代：丁玲和陈企霞曾经共同密谋在今年10月准备举行的第三次全国文艺界代表大会上向党大举进攻，如果失败，就公开制造分裂。据葛文揭发，丁玲曾对她说过，要登报声明，公开退出中国作家协会。陈企霞也交代说，他要在报上发表“告别文艺界”的文章，也退出作协。
    丁玲、陈企霞所以预备要这样做，是企图造成一种局面，来威胁党，要党向他们屈服。也正是为了这样一个目的，陈企霞在大鸣大放的时候，还想办一个刊物，目的在顶垮“文艺报”。在“文艺报”内部，陈企霞以前的亲信唐因、唐达成等不但利用职权，想把“文艺报”变成资产阶级的“自由论坛”，走“文汇报”的道路，而且还在“文艺报”内部配合丁、陈，攻击党的领导，攻击党的文艺方针，企图推翻前年对“文艺报”所犯错误的检查结论。唐因、唐达成等并背着党图谋出版一个以文学评论为主要内容的“同人刊物”。这个组织同人刊物的秘密计划也得到了冯雪峰的支持。陈涌也是这个刊物的密谋者之一，他准备辞去“文艺报”编委的职务，他认为“大变动”的前夜到了。他们还准备要丁玲、刘宾雁等参加。他们把这个秘密计划告诉了“文汇报”的梅朵，却相约向党隐瞒。唐因、唐达成等还准备同人刊物如办不成，就退出“文艺报”。
    他们这一切见不得人的阴谋活动，是采取隐蔽的方式背着党的组织进行的。他们之间还曾多次订立攻守同盟，企图向党狡赖到底。
    在7月25日的第四次党组扩大会议上，有人开始对丁、陈等在前三次会上的进攻进行反击时，丁、陈等就惊慌起来了。他们秘密商量采取什么态度来对付这个反击。丁、陈之间的密商，大多经过陈明（党员）。陈明告诉陈企霞：丁玲准备“逆来顺受”。陈企霞说：“我不赞成，准备全面进攻。”他们这次见面中，订立了攻守同盟。陈明说：“如果质问你和丁玲的关系，你可以把前次和丁玲见面的日子往后推迟一天，就说我们是从邵荃麟那里出来偶然碰着的，你一定要进我家，进去只谈了戏，谈了作品，别的没谈。”陈明并要陈企霞告诉郑重（陈企霞的妻子），不要把他们前次会面的事讲出去。陈明与陈企霞之间的来往经常采取秘密方式，如打电话不讲真姓名，在街头约会，约陈企霞到丁玲家谈话要选择在丁玲家的一个公务员（共青团员）去上夜校的时候。陈企霞与柳溪之间也采用化名通信或用寄“小册子”，在杂志夹缝里写上几个字的诡秘方式传递消息。
    7月30日召开的第七次党组扩大会前，陈企霞给陈明打电话，问：“怎么办？”陈明很慌张，说：“可以检讨，但我们说的事（指攻守同盟）还是照样。”在这次党组会上，丁玲、陈企霞果然抵赖、狡辩。直到8月3日的第十次会议上，陈企霞才开始转变，交代了一些他和丁玲的密谋事实。陈企霞说：“我和丁玲在一起反党很久了，我们最近见面虽然不算多，但我们是心照不宣的。在任何场合，一个手势，一个眼色，一句话，彼此都能懂得是什么意思。”反党小集团开始崩溃丁玲、陈明继续顽抗
    党组扩大会议由作协副主席、作协党组书记邵荃麟主持。中共中央宣传部副部长周扬、中宣部机关党委书记李之琏出席了会议，并讲了话。他们指出这是文艺界一场极重要的具有高度原则意义的斗争。中国作家协会主席茅盾和著名社会活动家、鲁迅夫人许广平也在会上讲了话。他们认为这个会议有很大教育意义，并指出丁玲的严重个人主义思想的错误，希望她改悔。茅盾说丁玲身上至今还有“莎菲女士”的影子。（按：丁玲的处女作叫做“莎菲女士的日记”，发表于1927年，“莎菲女士”是这部作品的主角，是一个专门玩弄男性以达到自私自利的目的的女人。）许广平说丁玲现在的行为很像三十多年前鲁迅所反对过的女师大校长杨荫榆。在会上先后发言的有刘白羽、林默涵、张天翼、沙汀、艾芜、方纪、曹禺、田间、郭小川、魏巍（代表出席会议的十七位部队作家）、康濯、邢野、严辰、逯斐等四十七人。刘白羽对丁玲等的反党活动作了系统的揭露和分析，同时对1955年作协肃反和对丁、陈斗争的某些错误缺点也作了检查。其他发言者也都热烈拥护和支持这场维护社会主义文艺事业和党的原则的斗争。
    会议采取了实事求是、严肃说理的方针，使反党分子陈企霞从狡赖转变为开始坦白交代。在党组和到会同志的帮助下，在柳溪的控诉和揭露下，陈企霞不得不对自己的严重罪行作了初步交代，并表示要下决心悔改，重新做人。陈企霞并用事实说明了丁玲企图篡夺文艺界领导权的野心，同时揭发了冯雪峰对他的反党活动表示支持的言论，和另外一些反党的言论。丁玲前后作了四次发言，先是向党猖狂进攻，要求翻案，在进攻失败后，她就假作检讨，一方面避重就轻，百般抵赖，一方面把自己装成十分受委屈的样子，把她的反党行为说成只是对文艺界某些党的领导同志的意见，这样来企图取得一部分人的同情。陈明则始终百般为丁玲开脱狡辩，自己不作任何交代。
    冯雪峰作了初步检讨，承认自己有严重的个人主义和反党情绪，承认自己的文艺思想同党与毛泽东同志的文艺思想是有抵触的。
    艾青也初步承认了自己的错误，并揭发了丁玲的一些反党言行。
    出席会议的人一致认为，会议有很大教育意义，这是文艺界社会主义思想对资产阶级思想的斗争，党的路线和反党路线的斗争：丁、陈集团如果从1942年算起，已经存在了十五年之久，对这个反党集团的斗争，现在仅仅取得了初步胜利。大家对柳溪的交代和她对陈企霞的控诉表示同情和支持，对陈企霞的开始认罪，也表示欢迎，希望他们以及其他与这个集团有关的人继续向党坦白。会议对丁玲、陈明等的继续顽抗一致表示愤慨，责成他们必须全部、彻底、干净地交代他们的罪恶活动事实。
    党组扩大会仍在继续举行中。
