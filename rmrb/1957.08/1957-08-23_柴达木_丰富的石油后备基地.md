　　Qaidam – A Rich Reserve Base for Petroleum
　　This newspaper, Xining, 22nd: The world-renowned Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, after three years of exploration, has now been confirmed as a reliable and rich reserve base for petroleum in our country. According to preliminary statistics: The Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Qinghai Petroleum Survey Team of the Ministry of Geology have explored and identified 98 well-defined oil-bearing structures in the basin, and have drilled more than 100 deep, medium, and shallow wells on dozens of oil-bearing structures. During the exploration, 63 wells have gushed crude oil, encountered oil flows, or shown oil and gas. Three oil fields with industrial value have been initially confirmed after oil testing. Since the first deep exploration well at Youquanzi began drilling in November 1955, five petroleum exploration areas have been opened up in the Qaidam Basin. In 1956, 14 exploration wells in the Lenghu exploration area showed oil gushing, oil flowing, or oil and gas. It was also discovered that there are seven to eight shallow oil layers in this exploration area, with a total thickness of about 45 meters. The Youquanzi, Youdunzi, and Dafengshan structures also showed a large amount of oil and gas during the drilling process.

　　This year, Qaidam's petroleum drilling work has been another fruitful year. The Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau has drilled with success in seven newly drilled medium-deep and deep exploration wells and fifteen shallow wells, with oil seen in every well. The first exploration well drilled in the Kaitemilike structure experienced continuous oil gushing three times at different depths. A medium-deep well in Youquanzi, when drilled to 710 meters, the underground crude oil surged to the surface, which continued for two days. This was the largest oil gush in the Qaidam Basin so far. Youshashan is a new exploration area opened up this year, and the two shallow wells and four medium-deep exploration wells drilled successively have encountered shallow oil layers. Within the explored area, the oil-bearing sandstone is very thick, with good permeability and porosity, and the oil layer thickness and physical properties are very stable. Shallow Well No. 2 produces 15 tons per day after oil testing, the production is stable, and the crude oil quality is very good, which is the best oil field known at present. The data obtained prove that the shallow formation in the Qaidam oil-bearing structure has high pressure and the crude oil quality is very good. In the Lenghu No. 4 and Youquanzi structures, one medium-deep well can produce 30 tons of crude oil per day, and one well can produce an average of 7 tons per day after five months of trial mining.

　　Today, the construction of the Qaidam petroleum exploration base has taken initial shape. The first small refinery began construction in May this year, and the machinery and equipment will be installed and tested in the fourth quarter. (Attached picture)

### 柴达木——丰富的石油后备基地

　　柴达木——丰富的石油后备基地
    本报西宁22日电　驰名中外的青海柴达木盆地，经过三年来的勘探，现已肯定为我国可靠而丰富的石油后备基地。据初步统计：石油工业部青海石油勘探局和地质部青海石油普查大队在盆地内探明了九十八个圈闭良好的储油构造，并且在数十个储油构造上钻探深、中、浅井一百多口；勘探中已有六十三口井喷出原油、遇到油流或有油气显示。经过试油、初步肯定有工业价值的油田三个。从1955年11月油泉子第一口深探井开钻以来，截至现在，柴达木盆地已先后开辟了五个石油探区。1956年冷湖探区就有十四口探井喷油、流油或有油气显示。并发现这个探区浅油层有七到八层，总厚度达四十五公尺左右。油泉子、油墩子和大风山等构造在钻进过程中也都有大量的油气显示。
    今年柴达木石油钻探工作又是一个丰收年。青海石油勘探局在新开钻的七口中深、深探井和十五口浅井中钻钻有喜，井井见油。在开特米里克构造开钻的第一探井，在不同的深度曾连续三次发生喷油现象。油泉子一口中深井，钻进七百一十公尺时，地下的原油即汹涌喷出地面，一直持续两天。这是柴达木盆地油喷以来阵势最大的一次。油砂山是今年开辟的新探区，先后开钻的二口浅井和四口中深探井都遇到了浅油层。在已探明的范围内，含油砂岩很厚，渗透率和空隙度都很好，油层厚度和物理性质也都很稳定。浅二井经试油每日产十五吨，产量稳定，原油质量很好，是当前已知的最好油田。从已得资料证明：柴达木储油构造的浅层压力大，原油质量很好。冷湖四号和油泉子构造，其中有一口中深井一天竟可产原油三十吨，有一口井试采五个月平均日产七吨。
    今天，柴达木的石油勘探基地建设已初具规模。第一座小型炼油厂今年5月开始建立，第四季度机器设备即可安装完毕，进行试炼。（附图片）
