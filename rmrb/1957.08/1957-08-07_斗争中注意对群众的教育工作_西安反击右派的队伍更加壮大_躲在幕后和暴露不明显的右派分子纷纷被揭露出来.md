    Pay attention to the education of the masses in the struggle.
    The ranks of Xi'an's counterattack against the rightists are growing stronger.
    Rightists hiding behind the scenes and those not obviously exposed are being revealed one after another.
    (Our report) Currently, the struggle against the rightists in the Xi'an area is rapidly developing to all walks of life. This is a new stage in the struggle against the rightists. This new stage is marked by: the ranks of the counterattack against the rightists are growing stronger, uniting the vast majority of the masses in various units, and forming a strong force to defend socialism; the first batch of exposed rightists has been defeated, and those hiding behind the scenes and those not obviously exposed have been revealed by the masses.
    Judging from the current situation, the ranks of the struggle are becoming stronger and stronger, and the masses' ideological awareness is increasing. This force defending socialism includes the vast majority of the masses. Those who once had unclear understanding and insufficiently active attitudes towards the struggle against the rightists have gradually awakened and are fighting against the rightists. For example, in Xi'an Normal College, many people did not actively participate in this political struggle, and some people sympathized with the rightists. Now they have all joined the struggle against the rightists. Another example is the Northwest Industrial Architectural Design Institute and the Electric Power Design Institute. Originally, many people took a wait-and-see attitude towards the struggle against the rightists, but now they have all joined the struggle. This is because the leaders at all levels in the Xi'an area paid attention to the education of the broad masses while fighting against the rightists. For example, the cultural and educational departments of Xi'an City and the three design institutes in the Xi'an area conducted individual conversations with those who had not yet actively participated in the struggle against the rightists. For another example, the rightists of the Northwest Industrial Design Institute once falsely accused the Party Committee of collective corruption. Many people, because they did not understand the truth, adopted a wait-and-see and suspicious attitude. The leaders of the institute absorbed them into an inspection team to conduct inspections. The results of the inspection confirmed that this was completely a rumor and slander by the rightists. Therefore, the broad masses were very angry and quickly participated in the struggle against the rightists. Some units also organized the masses to visit factories and agricultural cooperatives, or invited workers and farmers to give reports and have discussions in their units, using concrete facts to educate the masses, so that the masses realized that the so-called "agricultural cooperation has been messed up" and "people's living standards have been lowered" and other reactionary remarks were purely fabricated.
    During this period, the masses created some new experiences in struggle. Therefore, some rightists who were hiding behind the scenes "fanning the flames" also showed their true colors. For example, Xi'an Normal College exposed the masterminds behind the reactionary organizations "Revival Society" and "Education Vanguard" one by one. Generally, all units have adopted well-prepared small-scale debates, selected some major reactionary arguments, and conducted face-to-face criticism. At the debate, the rightists are also allowed to refute. Experience has proved that the more they refute, the more contradictions in their reactionary arguments, and the more profound the criticism. The reactionary arguments of the rightists had to declare bankruptcy in the face of facts.
    With the deepening of the movement, the number of rightists inside and outside the Party has increased. In the past, those units that did not have rightists now have rightists. According to statistics from various units in the province and city, of the 62 units that originally did not have rightists, one-third of the units have now found rightists. (Zhu Bo)

    斗争中注意对群众的教育工作
    西安反击右派的队伍更加壮大
    躲在幕后和暴露不明显的右派分子纷纷被揭露出来
    本报讯　目前，西安地区的反击右派的斗争，正迅速地向各行各业发展。这是反右派斗争的一个新阶段，这个新的阶段标志着：反击右派的队伍更加壮大了，它团结了各单位的绝大多数群众，形成一支捍卫社会主义的坚强的力量；而第一批暴露出来的右派分子已被斗垮了，那些躲在幕后的和暴露不明显的右派分子，也都纷纷被群众揭露了出来。
    从目前的情况看，斗争的队伍愈来愈强大，群众思想觉悟愈来愈提高，这支捍卫社会主义的队伍，包括了群众的绝大多数，那些一度对反右派斗争认识不够清楚、态度不够积极的群众也逐渐觉悟了起来，向右派分子作斗争，例如西安师范学院，原来有不少群众没有积极参加这场政治斗争，还有一些群众同情右派分子，现在全部参加了对右派的斗争。又如西北工业建筑设计院，电力设计院等单位，原来也有不少人对反右派斗争采取观望态度，现在也全部参加了斗争。这是因为西安地区的各级领导，在反右派斗争的同时注意了对广大群众的教育工作，如西安市文教部门，西安地区的三个设计院，都对那些还没有积极参加反右派斗争的人进行了个别交谈。再如西北工业设计院的右派分子曾诬蔑该院党委集体贪污，有不少人因不明真象，抱着观望、怀疑的态度，该院领导上就吸收他们组织检查组进行检查，检查结果证实这完全是右派分子造谣诬蔑，因此，广大群众非常气愤，并迅速地参加了反击右派分子的斗争。还有些单位组织群众参观访问工厂、农业合作社，或请工人、农民到本单位作报告和座谈。用具体事实来教育群众，使群众认识到所谓“农业合作化搞糟了”、“人民生活降低了”等反动言论纯系捏造。
    这一时期，群众创造了一些新的斗争经验，因此，一些藏在背后“摇扇子”的右派分子，也都纷纷显出了原形，如西安师范学院把反动组织“复活社”、“教育尖兵”的幕后人都一一揭发出来了。各单位一般都采取了有充分准备的小型辩论会，选择一些主要反动论点，面对面的进行批判，在辩论会上还允许右派分子反驳，经验证明他们愈反驳，其反动论点的矛盾愈多，批判的也就愈深刻。使得右派分子的反动论点，在事实面前不得不宣告破产。
    随着运动的深入，党内外的右派分子增多了，过去，那些没有右派分子的单位，现在也出现了右派分子，根据省、市各单位统计，原来没有右派分子的六十二个单位，现在已经有三分之一的单位查出了右派分子。　（朱波）
