Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 26th: The current total circulation of newspapers and magazines in Albania is 190,000 copies per issue. Averaging the total population of 1.4 million, almost one in seven people subscribes to a newspaper or magazine.
　　The "People's Voice," the central organ of the Albanian Labour Party, now has a daily circulation of 48,000 copies, which is approximately five times the total circulation of all newspapers in the country before liberation.
　　The "People's Voice" commemorated its fifteenth anniversary of publication on August 25th. On the evening of the 24th, the Albanian press and publishing circles held a gathering in Tirana to celebrate this Publishing Festival designated for commemoration by the People's Government.
　　Albania's press and publishing industry has developed extensively under the people's regime. Before liberation, there were only two newspapers in the country, with a circulation of less than 10,000 copies; today, there are ten newspapers and twenty-three magazines, with a total circulation of 190,000 copies per issue.
　　In the fourteen years before liberation, the country published only 832 books, with a total printing of more than 2.4 million copies, while the total number of books published since liberation has exceeded the total number of books published in Albania's four-hundred-year history. In 1956 alone, 221 new books were published, with a printing of more than one million copies, and a large number of works by Albanian classical writers and Marxist-Leninist classics were also reprinted.
　　In terms of broadcasting, Albania had only two small radio stations before the war, while today there are eight central and local radio stations, with power more than twenty-eight times greater than in the past, broadcasting continuously for twenty-one and a half hours every day. In addition to broadcasting news at home and abroad in the national language, it also broadcasts news in Russian, French, Italian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, Turkish, and Serbian.

　　阿尔巴尼亚纪念出版节
　　解放以来期刊出版数量增加许多倍
    新华社地拉那26日电　阿尔巴尼亚目前全国报纸和杂志的每期发行量共达十九万份。按全国一百四十万人口平均计算，几乎每七个人就订有一份报纸或杂志。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关报“人民之声报”现在每天发行四万八千份，大约相当于解放前全国报纸发行总量的五倍。
      “人民之声报”在8月25日纪念了它的创刊的十五周年。24日晚间，阿尔巴尼亚新闻出版界在地拉那举行集会，庆祝这个由人民政府规定纪念的出版节。
    阿尔巴尼亚的新闻出版事业在人民政权下得到了广泛的发展。解放前，全国只有两种报纸，发行额不到一万份；而今天全国已经有十种报纸和二十三种杂志，每期的总发行额达十九万份。
    在解放前的十四年内，全国只出版了八百三十二种书籍，共印行二百四十多万册，而解放以来出版的书籍的总数已经超过了阿尔巴尼亚历史上四百年出版书籍的总数，仅在1956年一年就出版了二百二十一种新书，印行了一百多万册，并且还大量再版了阿尔巴尼亚古典作家的作品和马克思列宁主义的经典著作。
    在广播事业方面，战前阿尔巴尼亚只有两个小型电台，而今天中央和地方电台共有八座，电力比过去增强了二十八倍多，每天连续广播达二十一个半小时。除了用本国语言向国内外广播外，还用俄、法、意、保、罗、希、土以及塞尔维亚等语言对外广播新闻。
