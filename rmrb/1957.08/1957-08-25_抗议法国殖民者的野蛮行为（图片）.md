    Protesting the Barbaric Acts of French Colonialists
    This is a village in Algeria where French colonial troops recently carried out a barbaric massacre. A mother lies in a pool of blood, her child crying in her arms. The soldiers of the Algerian National Liberation Army arrived in time, drove away the colonial troops, and rescued the child who had forever lost his mother from the pool of blood!
