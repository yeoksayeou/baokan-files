　  Immature Corn and Sweet Potatoes
　  Should Not Be Allowed to Enter the Free Market
    Some agricultural cooperatives or farmers located closer to towns and cities, driven by the pursuit of high prices, often dig up immature corn and sweet potatoes before the autumn harvest to sell in towns. Some peddlers, seeing the potential for profit, are also very active in this. This practice may bring some immediate benefits to those who sell and transport these products; however, it is detrimental to increasing grain production. A single, partially-filled green corn cob provides limited nutrition to people; if allowed to mature, it could at least serve as one meal's worth of staple food. Sweet potatoes grow very quickly in their later stages, and the potatoes harvested after autumn will be at least two to three times larger than those dug up now.
    From August 15th, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Grain Bureau, and the Third Commercial Bureau implemented a new management method for the sale of green corn and other similar products: all green corn transported into the city will be purchased by the state-owned Vegetable, Food and Grocery Company at a prescribed price, and then allocated to state-owned retail stores in various districts to supply citizens; retail vendors are not allowed to deal in raw or cooked corn; collective catering units in urban areas are not allowed to purchase from agricultural cooperatives; and agricultural cooperatives and farmers are not allowed to transport green corn and other similar products to sell on the streets of urban areas. This is very necessary. Grain is a commodity purchased and sold by the state; green corn and other similar products should be treated the same as other grains.
    In northern regions, summer-sown corn is about to tassel, and the tubers of sweet potatoes are swelling. If areas with the habit of selling green corn and prematurely dug sweet potatoes also implement the Tianjin method, it can effectively prevent this wasteful behavior before the autumn harvest.

### 没有成熟的玉米和甘薯不该允许进入自由市场

　  没有成熟的玉米和甘薯
　  不该允许进入自由市场
    一些距市镇较近的农业社或农民，由于追逐高的售价，每逢秋前就采掘没有成熟的玉米，甘薯到市镇上出售。有些小贩因为有利可图，对这也很积极。这样做，对出售和贩运的人是有些眼前好处的；但是，对增产粮食则很不利。一两个才灌浆的青玉米给人们的养分有限；如果等它成熟了，至少可以作为一顿口粮。甘薯后期生长很快，秋后刨的薯块比现在刨出的至少要大两三倍。
    天津市工商局、粮食局、第三商业局等单位由8月15日起对销售青棵玉米等实行了一种新的管理办法：运入市区的青棵玉米一律由国营蔬菜食品杂货公司按规定的价格收购，然后再拨交各区国营零售店供应市民；零售商贩一律不准经营生熟玉米；市区各集体伙食单位不许到农业社采购；农业社和农民不准把青玉米等运到市区街头销售。这样做是很必要的。粮食是国家统购物资；对青玉米等也该和别的粮食同样看待。
    北方地区夏播玉米就要抽穗了，甘薯的薯块正在膨大。有出售青玉米、早刨的甘薯习惯的地区，如果也实行天津市的这个办法，就可以有效地制止秋收前这种浪费粮食的行为。
