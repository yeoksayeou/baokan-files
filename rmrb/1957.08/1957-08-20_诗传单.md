    Poetry Leaflet
    The Question of Stance
    Tu An, are you taking the socialist road? Or the capitalist path? You shake your head and say, "I don't really know." Some want the Communist Party to step down, some want to steal the republic, you blink your eyes and say, "It's not a big deal." Getting one more piece of stationery, your veins bulge; getting one less piece of furniture, you jump up and down. Major issues of right and wrong, you have little interest in; minor issues, you haggle over every detail. You only argue whether chicken feathers are good or not, only argue whether garlic skins are needed or not, without asking whether your head will fall off, what will become of you if this continues?
    Nursery Rhyme
    Honeydew melons and bitter melons don't grow on the same vine, phoenixes and crows aren't born from the same mother, poisonous berries and honeyed fruits don't grow on the same tree, fragrant flowers and wild grasses don't share the same root.

    立场问题
    屠岸走社会主义的路？走资本主义的道？你摇摇头说：“不大知道。”有人要叫共产党下台，有人要把共和国偷盗，你眨眨眼说：“不大紧要。”多分到一件文具，你青筋直暴；少领到一件家具，你双脚直跳。大是大非，你兴趣不高；小是小非，你斤斤计较。你只争鸡毛好不好，只争蒜皮要不要，不问脑袋掉不掉，这样下去咋得了？
    儿歌
    童甜瓜苦瓜不是一根藤，凤凰乌鸦不是一娘生，毒莓蜜果不结一棵树，香花野草不是一条根。
