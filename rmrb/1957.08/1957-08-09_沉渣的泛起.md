    The Re-emergence of Sediment
    Liu Feng
    Recently, newspapers in various places have exposed a lot of the history of right-wing elements, giving people the feeling of "the re-emergence of sediment." People have seen that some of these right-wing elements are politicians who have long harbored ambitions to oppose the Soviet Union and oppose communism, some are executioners who have consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary coups, some are general-level staff officers of the Kuomintang war zone headquarters, some are general managers of the Three People's Principles Youth League, some are chief editors of the Kuomintang Central Daily News, some are Kuomintang news censors, some are the notorious "third kind of people," and some are agents of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, the Military Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, and the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. It turns out that these people are all revolutionaries with their hands stained with the blood of the people, and they are all murderers who carried out military and cultural encirclement and suppression of the Communist Party and progressive people.
    These people fundamentally opposed the democratic revolution, and now they are naturally even more dissatisfied and uncomfortable with entering the socialist revolution. They harbor ulterior motives, usurping legitimate parties to carry out illegal activities. They even specialize in gathering backward elements, those who are dissatisfied with the status quo, and those with past wrongdoings. They do not let go of those who have just finished serving their sentences or whose crimes have not yet been confessed. Their intentions are obvious.
    Such a collection of characters gathered together, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, shouted "The time has come!" These sediments couldn't hold back and finally floated to the surface. This is just as Mr. Lu Xun said: "What floats up is sediment, and sediment is ultimately just sediment, so because of this floating, its true colors become even clearer, and its final destiny is still to sink down." The re-emergence of sediment shows that carrying out the socialist revolution is not something to be taken lightly. The re-emergence of sediment naturally also plays the role of a negative example. The sins of these right-wing elements with past wrongdoings are profound. If they continue to be obsessed and oppose the Party and socialism, they will only sink deeper and deeper.

    沉渣的泛起
    刘丰
    最近各地报纸对右派分子的历史作了不少揭露，使人有“沉滓的泛起”的感觉。人们看到：这些右派分子有的是久具野心的反苏反共的政客，有的是一贯反革命政变的刽子手，有的是国民党战区长官部的将级参谋，有的是三民主义青年团的总干事，有的是国民党中央日报总编辑，有的是国民党新闻检查官，有的是臭名昭著的第三种人，有的是中统、军统、中美合作所的特务，原来这些人都是双手沾满人民鲜血的革命罪人，他们都是些对共产党和进步人士进行军事和文化围剿的凶手。
    这些人对于民主主义革命根本就是反对的，现在进入社会主义革命自然更加不满意、不舒服了。他们心怀叵测，篡夺了合法的党派，来进行非法的活动。甚至专门网罗落后分子，不满现状之徒、历史上有罪行的人。对服刑刚满或罪行还没有交代的人，都不放过去。这是何居心，可想而知的。
    这样的一些货色聚集在一起，趁大鸣大放的时机，喊出了“是时候了”。这些沉滓沉不住气，终于浮了上来。这诚如鲁迅先生所说：“泛起来的是沉滓，沉滓又究竟不过是沉滓，所以因此一泛，他的本相倒越加分明，而最后的命运，也还是仍旧沉下去。”沉滓泛起了，这说明进行社会主义革命并不是可以高枕无忧的。沉滓泛起了，自然也起了反面的教材的作用。这些历史上有罪行的右派分子的罪孽是深重的，如果继续执迷不悟和党和社会主义为敌，就只有沉下去得越来越深。
