Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: On the evening of August 4th, the Shanghai public security organs lawfully arrested Chen Mengyan, a current counter-revolutionary criminal who had twice publicly distributed reactionary leaflets.

At around 7:00 AM on August 4th, Chen Mengyan was distributing reactionary leaflets supporting the Zhang-Luo alliance near the Shanghai People's Amusement Park. When the criminal Chen threw more than sixty leaflets into the crowd, he was immediately handed over to the police station by youths Wang Dequan, Gu Songlin, and others. At this time, the crowd gathered at the entrance of the police station was filled with righteous indignation. Many people expressed to the people's police their willingness to serve as witnesses. This was the second time that the criminal Chen had distributed reactionary leaflets. At around 5:00 PM on August 3rd, the criminal Chen also carried more than forty such leaflets, took a trolley to the vicinity of the Da Guangming Cinema on Nanjing West Road, and distributed them.

The criminal Chen is a teaching director at Shanghai Yangjing Middle School. More than twenty years ago, he served as a lieutenant adjutant in the Jingxian Security Brigade of the Kuomintang Anhui Provincial Security Department. Not long ago, he openly spread reactionary remarks in the school, saying that "the Zhang-Luo alliance is the result of the working class oppressing intellectuals." In the leaflets he printed, he promoted "shortening the distance between revolution and counter-revolution," demanded "universal leniency" for counter-revolutionary special agents, and slandered the Communist Party for treating intellectuals "as slaves."

    陈梦炎散发反动传单
    当场被群众扭送派出所
    据新华社上海7日电　8月4日晚上，上海市公安机关依法逮捕了两次公开散发反动传单的现行反革命罪犯陈梦炎。
    4日上午七时许，陈梦炎在上海人民游乐场附近散发支持章罗联盟的反动传单，当陈犯把六十多张传单在人群中向上抛发时，立即被青年王德全、顾松林等人扭送派出所。这时，拥集在派出所门口的行人群情激愤，很多人都向人民警察表示愿做见证人，这是陈犯第二次散发反动传单。8月3日下午五时许，陈犯也曾经携带这种传单四十多张，乘电车到南京西路大光明电影院附近散发。
    陈犯是上海洋泾中学教导员。二十多年前，他曾在国民党安徽省保安处泾县保安大队任过中尉副官。不久以前，他公开在学校中散布反动言论，说“章罗联盟是工人阶级压迫知识分子的结果”。在他印发的传单中，他宣传“要缩短革命与反革命的距离”，要求对反革命特务分子“一律宽大”，污蔑共产党把知识分子“当做奴隶”。
