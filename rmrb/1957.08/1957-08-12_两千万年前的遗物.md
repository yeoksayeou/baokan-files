    Relics from Twenty Million Years Ago
    Recently, many fish tooth-shaped fossils were discovered in a mine tunnel in Minamiizu, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. These fossils are triangular, eight centimeters long, eight centimeters wide, and have sharp tips. According to Professor Toyofumi Yoshimura of Kyushu University, an authority on geology, these fossils are shark tooth fossils.
    The mine containing these shark tooth fossils is located in an offshore area of the southern Izu Peninsula, at an altitude of 340 meters. Some believe that part of the Izu Peninsula was under the sea 20 million years ago, and then gradually rose to become a peninsula, thus speculating that these fossils are at least 20 million years old.

    两千万年前的遗物
    最近在日本静冈县的南伊豆的矿山坑道中，发现了许多鱼齿形化石。这些化石呈三角形，长八公分，宽八公分、前端尖锐。据地质学权威九州大学吉村丰文教授鉴定，这些化石是鲨鱼齿的化石。
    藏有这些鲨鱼齿化石的矿山，位于伊豆半岛南部近海地方。海拔三百四十公尺。有人认为：伊豆半岛的一部分，在两千万年前是在海底中，其后始渐渐隆起而成为半岛，因而推测这些化石至少是两千万年前的遗物。
