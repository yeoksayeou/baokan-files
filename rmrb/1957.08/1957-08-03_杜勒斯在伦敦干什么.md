What is Dulles Doing in London
    Gu Si
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles dramatically flew to London on July 29. On August 1, French Foreign Minister Pineau was also summoned to meet with the U.S. and British foreign ministers. This is the first meeting of the foreign ministers of the three Western countries since the Suez War last fall.
    Dulles's main purpose in going to London is twofold: one is to devise new obstacles on the issue of disarmament to resist the strong pressure from the Soviet Union and world public opinion to sign a disarmament agreement; the other is to discuss the Oman issue with Britain and exert pressure on Britain on behalf of American oil monopoly capital. Disarmament talks and the Oman issue are two major events in the current international situation.
    Turning Disarmament Negotiations into a "Broken-Legged Horse"
    The disarmament issue is now facing a critical juncture. According to the resolution of the previous UN General Assembly, the Disarmament Subcommittee's meeting, which began in London in March this year, should come to an end by the end of July and submit a report to the United Nations on August 1.
    However, the record of the past four months and more makes it impossible for Western countries to give an account to the United Nations in the face of world opinion. During the negotiations, the Soviet Union made several specific and practical proposals that provided a good basis for reaching an agreement. However, Western countries created complications on every important issue, making the negotiations fruitless. The U.S. representative even adopted an unprecedented delaying tactic, proposing a so-called "one spoonful at a time" American "plan," which dragged on for nearly two months and has not yet been fully presented. This American approach has put it in a very passive position politically. Because this exposes even more the bellicose face of the United States, which is obstructing disarmament, has no intention of stopping the arms race, and is unwilling to ease international tensions. At the same time, the confusion within Western countries due to mutual buck-passing is increasing daily. In this situation, Dulles had to rush to London in order to try to reverse this passive and chaotic situation.
    The first tactic adopted by Dulles was to publicize the importance of his personal intervention, as if he were going to resolve the deadlock in the disarmament conference. But the key to the current disarmament issue is whether the United States is willing to reach an agreement. If the United States is willing to do so, an agreement to stop nuclear weapons testing can be signed immediately, and the first phase of the agreement to reduce conventional armaments is also "waiting for the east wind." However, the United States refuses to take a step forward on these practical and feasible issues, but tries its best to link these issues with many artificial problems, making them increasingly complex.
    In order to continue to delay the negotiations, Dulles, as soon as he arrived in London, immediately wooed Britain and France, trying to come up with a joint proposal on the issue of aerial inspection. However, aerial inspection is a major issue related to the security of a country. Therefore, to implement such inspection, it must be based on the sincerity of both parties in prohibiting atomic weapons and comprehensively disarming, and it can only be gradually implemented along with corresponding disarmament agreements. In order to reach an agreement, the Soviet Union has put forward specific proposals based on the U.S. proposals: the first step is to implement inspections in parts of the Far East, North America, and Europe, which is in line with the initial disarmament agreement. However, the United States refuses to accept this realistic proposal and adopts a surprising self-contradictory approach: on the one hand, it refuses to stop the nuclear arms race and spread an atmosphere of distrust, and on the other hand, it shouts "open skies." In his speech on July 22, Dulles said that prohibiting nuclear weapons and drastically reducing conventional armaments were both "impracticable" and that signing a disarmament agreement was "untrustworthy." Therefore, the United States does not intend to reduce its military strength, and will continue to vigorously develop nuclear armaments, nor can it withdraw the military bases and troops surrounding the Soviet Union.
    Obviously, Dulles's current focus on the issue of aerial inspection is not to solve any problems at all, but to deliberately make it unacceptable to the other party, creating endless disputes, so as to achieve the purpose of obstructing the disarmament agreement without bearing the responsibility for breaking off the negotiations, and shifting the responsibility to the other party. Associated Press news analyst Roberts said on July 30 that Dulles's main purpose was to "keep a horse with two or three broken legs." That is to say, to keep the disarmament negotiations going, but to make it impossible to move forward.
    Why does the United States want to drag on like this? This is because the pressure of public opinion is difficult to resist. Moreover, West Germany will hold a general election in September this year. If the London negotiations completely break down, then Adenauer, who is following the United States, will lose even more popular support at home; and if the disarmament negotiations make progress, Adenauer, who is implementing the U.S. policy of arming West Germany, will also be defeated. Therefore, for Adenauer's sake, the United States must maintain the state of suspended animation in the disarmament negotiations for a while. From the U.S. insistence on rearming West Germany, it can be seen that the United States has no sincerity in implementing disarmament at all.
    Another Round of the Anglo-American Oil War
    While planning to obstruct the disarmament negotiations in London, Dulles took time to discuss the Oman issue with the British government. Although the content of their discussions has not been revealed, it seems from all aspects that this is another round in the Anglo-American struggle for Middle East oil.
    Oman is an Imamate located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, outside the Persian Gulf. In November 1955, Britain used the Sultan of Muscat's army to occupy Oman. Prior to this, in October, Britain occupied the Buraimi Oasis in Saudi Arabia. The purpose of Britain's actions was to seize the oil resources of these two places, prevent the infiltration of American forces, and consolidate its series of colonies on the southern and eastern edges of the Arabian Peninsula, protecting its oil interests in the Persian Gulf region.
    Britain and Saudi Arabia have been in dispute over the Buraimi Oasis for a long time. Britain refuses to withdraw. According to the "New York Herald Tribune," at the Anglo-American Bermuda conference this year, Eisenhower asked Britain to withdraw from the Buraimi Oasis. Later, the U.S. State Department specially sent Assistant Secretary of State Henderson to London to put pressure on Britain. The U.S. reason is that the United States is wooing Saudi Arabia to implement the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, so it is necessary to return the Buraimi Oasis to Saudi Arabia. But Britain saw through the American plan to drive away Britain and seize the oil resources here, so it refused to agree.
    In mid-July, the people of Oman launched an armed uprising demanding the restoration of the Imamate of Oman. The uprising of the Omani people is part of the Arab people's struggle against colonialism and for independence. Britain was alarmed by this uprising. Because if the uprising succeeds, not only will the oil resources in Oman not be preserved, but the Buraimi Oasis will also not be preserved. The impact may extend to the current British oil-rich colonies in the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait, which may rise up in competition. This gives the United States, which has long coveted British oil interests in the Persian Gulf, a great opportunity. And if the situation develops to this point, Britain's decline will be irreversible. The West German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" pointed out that without the foreign exchange income from Persian Gulf oil, the pound would collapse.
    Therefore, Britain immediately began armed suppression of the uprising people of Oman. Britain not only supported and helped the Sultan of Muscat's army, but also dispatched the British Air Force to indiscriminately bomb the insurgents, and transferred ground troops from Kenya. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd openly admitted in the British House of Commons that Britain did this because "British interests are directly involved." He also said that the importance of the Persian Gulf to Britain did not need to be emphasized by him. From Britain's current deployment, it seems that Britain intends to first use air force bombing to shake the insurgents' will to fight, and then launch a pincer offensive with the army from the Buraimi Oasis and Muscat from the north and south, in order to eliminate the insurgents. But this area is a hot desert area, and there are high and barren mountains, so Britain's suppression action may not be effective quickly. And the Omani people's struggle for independence can be foreseen to be very difficult. But the Omani people have the support of the Arab people and the people of all countries who uphold justice. Their struggle may have twists and turns, but it will eventually be victorious.
    The United States takes a Schadenfreude attitude towards the uprising of the Omani people. The United States certainly does not want the Omani people to achieve true independence, but it sees this as an opportunity that can be used to squeeze out British interests in the Persian Gulf. The issue of the Buraimi Oasis has been raised again in American newspapers. The American propaganda machine is trying its best to point out that the uprising in Oman is supported by Saudi Arabia, while emphasizing that Saudi Arabia is a friend that the United States is vigorously striving for in the Middle East. The implication is that Britain must be more sensible and give up its plan to continue occupying the Buraimi Oasis and Oman, and should let the United States take over. This is also Dulles's real intention in going to London to put pressure on Britain.
    British newspapers, reflecting British official opinion, are full of resentment towards this American plan. The "Times" warned that due to "the close ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia, and due to the conflicting demands of British and American oil companies in the region," an Anglo-American split caused by the Oman incident is a "real danger." The Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" demanded "swift, firm, and decisive action to defend our broad and vital interests." This newspaper howled: "This may be our last chance in the Middle East. If we fail, there will be nothing left for us."
    "Oil is thicker than blood," we have once again seen the truth of this saying.

### 杜勒斯在伦敦干什么
顾思

    杜勒斯在伦敦干什么
    顾思
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在7月29日戏剧性地飞到了伦敦。8月1日，法国外长比诺也应召前往同美英外长会谈。这是从去年秋天苏伊士战争以来西方三国外长第一次聚会。
    杜勒斯到伦敦的主要目的有两个：一个是在裁军问题上策划新的阻挠手段，以抵抗苏联和世界舆论要求签订裁军协议的强大压力；另一个是同英国讨论阿曼事件，为美国石油垄断资本向英国施加压力。裁军谈判和阿曼问题，是目前国际局势中的两个重大事件。
    把裁军谈判变成一匹“断腿马”
    裁军问题现在面临一个重要的关头。根据上届联合国大会的决议，裁军小组委员会今年3月开始在伦敦举行的会议，到7月底应该告一段落，并在8月1日向联合国提出报告。
    但是，过去四个多月的记录，却使西方国家在世界舆论面前无法向联合国交账。在谈判过程中，苏联曾经几次提出具体的、切实可行的建议，为达成协议提供了良好的基础。可是西方国家却在每一个重要问题上都横生枝节，使得谈判一事无成。美国代表并采取了一种空前未有的怠工手段，他用所谓“一次给一勺”的办法提出一个美国“方案”，前后拖了将近两月，直到现在还没有把它全部提出来。美国的这种做法，使得它在政治上处于非常被动的地位。因为这把美国阻挠裁军、无意中止军备竞赛和不愿缓和国际紧张局势的好战脸孔，更加暴露出来了。同时，西方国家内部由于互相推卸责任而引起的混乱，也日见增加。在这种情况下，杜勒斯就不得不匆匆忙忙地跑到伦敦去，以便设法挽回这种被动和混乱的局面。
    杜勒斯所采取的第一个手段，是大肆张扬他这次亲自出马的重要性，仿佛他是为了解决裁军会议的僵局而去的。但是目前裁军问题的关键，就是美国愿不愿意达成协议的问题。如果美国有此意愿，停止核武器试验的协定马上就可以签字了，裁减常规军备的第一阶段的协定，也到了“只等东风”的地步。可是，美国就是不肯在这些切实可行的问题上前进一步，却极力把这些问题同其他许多人为的问题牵连在一起，使它们越来越复杂化。
    为了继续拖延谈判，杜勒斯一到伦敦后，就马上拉拢英、法，想要在空中视察问题上搞出一个共同的建议。但是，空中视察是关系一个国家安全的重大问题，因此要实行这种视察，就必须以双方都表现出具有禁止原子武器和全面裁军的诚意为基础，并且只可能随着相应的裁军协议逐步实施。苏联为了求得协议，已经以美国主张为基础提出了具体建议：第一步在远东、北美和欧洲的部分地区实行视察，这是同初步的裁军协议相适应的。但是，美国却不接受这个实事求是的建议，而采取了一种惊人的自相矛盾的做法：一方面拒绝停止核子武器竞赛和散布不信任气氛，另一方面又叫喊“开放天空”。杜勒斯在7月22日的演说中就说：禁止核子武器和大量裁减常规军备都是“行不通”的，签订裁军协议是“不可信赖”的，因此，美国不打算削减它的军事实力，并且还要继续大力发展核子军备，也不能撤退包围苏联的各个军事基地及其军队。
    很明显，杜勒斯目前抓住空中视察问题大做文章，根本不是为了解决任何问题，而是要故意使对方无法接受，造成无休止的争执，从而既达到阻挠裁军协议的目的，又不负破裂谈判的责任，并且把责任倒推到对方头上。美联社新闻分析员罗伯茨在7月30日说：杜勒斯的主要目的是要“保持一匹有两条或三条腿断了的马”。也就是说，要使裁军谈判继续拖下去，但又要使它寸步难行。
    美国为什么还要这样拖下去呢？这是因为舆论的压力难以抵挡。而且，西德在今年9月就要举行大选，如果伦敦谈判完全破裂，那么追随美国的阿登纳在国内就会更加失尽人心；而如果裁军谈判取得进展，执行美国武装西德政策的阿登纳同样要遭到失败。因此，美国为阿登纳打算，也必须使裁军谈判的不死不活状态再维持一个时候。从美国坚持重新武装西德也就可以看出，美国毫无实行裁军的诚意。
    英美石油战的又一个回合
    杜勒斯在伦敦策划阻挠裁军谈判的过程中，抽空同英国政府商谈了阿曼问题。虽然他们商谈的内容还没有透露，但是从各方面看来，这是英、美争夺中东石油之战中的又一个回合。
    阿曼是在阿拉伯半岛东部、波斯湾外面的一个教长国。1955年11月，英国利用马斯喀特苏丹的军队占领了阿曼。在此以前，在10月间，英国占领了沙特阿拉伯的布赖米绿洲。英国这样做的目的，是要夺取这两个地方的石油资源，防止美国势力的渗入，并巩固它在阿拉伯半岛的南缘和东缘的一连串殖民地，保护在波斯湾地区的石油利益。
    在布赖米绿洲问题上，英国和沙特阿拉伯长期发生争执。英国不肯退出。据“纽约先驱论坛报”报道，在今年英、美百慕大会议上，艾森豪威尔曾经要英国从布赖米绿洲退出。后来，美国国务院又特地派了助理国务卿汉德逊到伦敦去，对英国施加压力。美国的理由是，美国正在拉拢沙特阿拉伯来在中东推行艾森豪威尔主义，因此有必要把布赖米绿洲还给沙特阿拉伯。但是英国看穿了美国的打算是要赶走英国、夺取这里的石油资源，所以不肯答应。
    7月中旬，阿曼人民发动了武装起义，要求恢复阿曼教长国。阿曼人民的起义，是阿拉伯人民反对殖民主义、争取独立的斗争的一部分。英国对于这场起义感到惊慌。因为起义如果成功，不但在阿曼的石油资源保不住，布赖米绿洲也要保不住。影响所及，目前英国在波斯湾的盛产石油的殖民地如卡塔尔、巴林、科威特等，都可能起来竞相效尤。这就给了对英国在波斯湾的石油利益虎视眈眈已久的美国以大好机会。而如果局势发展到这步田地，英国的没落也就无可挽回了。西德“法兰克福总汇报”就指出，如果没有从波斯湾石油所得的外汇收入，英镑就会崩溃。
    因此，英国立即开始了对阿曼起义人民的武装镇压行动。英国不仅支持和帮助马斯喀特苏丹的军队，并且出动了英国空军对起义者滥肆轰炸，从怯尼亚调去了地面部队。英国外交大臣劳埃德在英国议会下院中公开承认，英国之所以这样做，是因为“英国的利益直接牵涉在内”。他还说，波斯湾对英国的重要性是用不着他来强调指出的。从英国目前的部署看来，英国打算先用空军轰炸来动摇起义者的斗争意志，然后以陆军从布赖米绿洲和马斯喀特南北两路发动钳形攻势，以消灭起义者。但是这一带是酷热的沙漠地区，并且有高峻而荒凉不毛的山脉，因此，英国的镇压行动未必能迅速奏效。而阿曼人民的争取独立的斗争，可以预见到也将是非常艰苦的。但是阿曼人民得到阿拉伯人民和世界各国主持正义的人民的支持。他们的斗争可能会有曲折，但是终将取得胜利。
    美国对于阿曼人民的起义抱着一种幸灾乐祸的态度。美国当然不希望阿曼人民取得真正的独立，但是它看到这是一个可以利用来排挤英国在波斯湾的利益的机会。布赖米绿洲的问题，又在美国报纸上被提出来了。美国宣传机器竭力指出阿曼的起义是受到沙特阿拉伯支持的，同时强调沙特阿拉伯是美国在中东正在大力加以争取的朋友。言下之意就是英国必须识相一些，放弃继续占领布赖米绿洲和阿曼的打算，而应该让美国来接手。这也就是杜勒斯到伦敦去向英国施加压力的真正意图。
    反映英国官方意见的英国报纸，对于美国的这种打算充满着愤激情绪。“泰晤士报”警告说，由于“美国和沙特阿拉伯之间存在的密切联系，由于英国和美国石油公司在这个地区的敌对要求”，由阿曼事件而导致英美分裂是一个“现实的危险”。保守党的“每日邮报”要求“迅速地、坚定地和决断地行动，以捍卫自己的广泛的和切身的利益”。这家报纸嚎叫道：“这可能是我们在中东的最后的机会了。如果我们失策，就不会有什么东西给我们留下了。”
    “油浓于血”，我们现在又一次看到了这句话的真实写照。
