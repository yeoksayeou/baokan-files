　　"Abundance Becomes a Disaster"
　　"Abundance Becomes a Disaster" sounds like a joke. But in the United States, it has truly become a problem.

　　Recently, the American "Time" magazine has been clamoring about this issue. When discussing the agricultural harvest in the United States, it wrote: "A bumper harvest is originally a matter to celebrate, but for the United States in 1957, good harvest weather is a national disaster, while drought is a blessing." The magazine worries that the newly harvested tens of thousands of tons of wheat, grains, and cotton will not flow to the market but will be poured into the US government's granaries, warehouses, and cellars piled with surplus agricultural products. Billions of dollars worth of agricultural products are already stored there, and they cannot be processed. According to "Time" magazine's estimate, a bumper harvest year will require the Department of Agriculture to spend a huge sum of five billion dollars to deal with surplus agricultural products.

　　Why does a bumper harvest become a disaster and a burden on the Department of Agriculture? The reason is actually very simple: in the United States, the production of cotton and grain is for the profits of capitalists, not for the people's food and clothing. Whether or not it is sent to the market depends on whether it can earn the most money. And the government has given agricultural capitalists a guarantee in the middle, as long as the profit drops below a fixed ratio, the government will use taxpayers' money to buy in large quantities to maintain a favorable high price in the market. Because of high prices and large profits, agricultural capitalists vigorously increase production, but ordinary people with limited incomes are hesitant because of the high prices. As a result, large quantities of grain mold in warehouses, but millions of families cannot get enough food.

　　However, the financial resources of the US government are ultimately limited. It is clearly impossible to use it to fill the ever-widening gap between agricultural production and consumption in the United States. In 1951, the US government spent 1.2 billion dollars to alleviate the crisis of agricultural overproduction. To date, this expenditure has increased to five billion dollars. The US government also uses various methods to dump agricultural products abroad in large quantities. Despite this, the situation has not improved significantly. Therefore, since last year, the US Department of Agriculture has had to focus on stepping up the reduction of planting areas. In this regard, a so-called land bank plan is being implemented, providing subsidies to farmers who reduce their acreage through the land bank. According to this method, the country will reduce 20 million acres of planting area within four years.

　　This year is the first year of the implementation of this plan, and the planting area has been reduced by 12 million acres compared to last year, becoming the year with the smallest planting area since 1917. The US agricultural authorities are very concerned about this year's harvest. They do not desire a bumper harvest, but are afraid that the harvest will be too good, which will make this plan fail. "Time" magazine understands the Department of Agriculture's state of mind, so when it sees a few clear days in this year's harvest season, it clamors that "abundance is about to become a disaster."

　　In fact, how can abundance become a disaster? It is the American social system that has led to this. (Zhen Ya)

### “丰收成灾”

　　“丰收成灾”
　  “丰收成灾”，像是一句笑话。但是在美国，这却真正成了一个问题。
    最近，美国“时代”周刊就在嚷嚷这个问题。它在谈到美国的农业收成时写道：“丰收在望原是一项值得庆贺的事，但是对于1957年的美国来说，良好的收获气候是国家的灾难，干旱反倒是一种恩赐。”这家杂志担心，新收获的成万吨小麦、谷物和棉花将不是流向市场而是倒进美国政府堆积剩余农产品的粮仓、货栈和地窖。在那里已经存有价值达几十亿美元的农产品，处理不了。据“时代”杂志估计，一个丰收年将使农业部得花五十亿美元的巨额支出来对付剩余农产品。
    为什么丰收会成为灾难和农业部的负担呢？讲起来道理也非常简单，就是：在美国，生产棉花、粮食是为了资本家的利润，而不是为了人民的衣食。送不送到市场上去，要看能不能赚最多的钱。而政府在这中间给农业资本家打了保票，只要利润一降到固定的比例以下，政府就用纳税人的钱来大量收进，维持市场上有利的高价。因为价高利大农业资本家就大力增产，但是收入有限的普通老百姓却因高价而裹足不前。于是，大批的粮食在仓库里发霉，成百万家庭却得不到足够的食物。
    但是，美国政府的财力毕竟有限。要以它来填平美国农业生产和消费之间的越来越大的空隙，显然不可能。美国政府为缓和农业生产过剩的危机，在1951年曾经花了十二亿美元。到目前，这笔开支增大到了五十亿美元。美国政府还用各种方法把农产品大量向国外倾销。尽管如此，情况并未有大的好转。因此从去年起，美国农业部又不得不从加紧减缩播种面积来打主意。在这方面，实行的是一项所谓土地银行计划，通过土地银行对减缩面积的农场主进行补贴。按照这个办法，在四年内要使全国减少两千万英亩的播种面积。
    今年是这个计划实施的第一年，播种面积已比去年减少了一千二百万英亩，成为1917年以来播种面积最少的一年。美国农业当局十分关心今年的年成。不是想望丰收，而是害怕年成太好，会使得这项计划落空。“时代”周刊体会农业部的这种心境，所以一看到今年收获季节出现的几天晴朗天气，就大嚷起“丰收要成灾”来。
    其实，丰收岂能成灾，美国的社会制度有以致之也（振亚）
