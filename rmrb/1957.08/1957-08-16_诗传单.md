Poetry Bulletin

	"Frankness" and "Courage"
	Yan Ling
	"How frank, how courageous!" Facing the rightist "warriors'" speeches, you incessantly praised them like this. "How frank, how courageous!" He "frankly" spat at the people, he "courageously" shot cold arrows at the Party. "How frank, how courageous!" He "frankly" swore allegiance to the enemy, he "courageously" waved iron fists at the people.
	"How frank, how courageous!" He has already placed a bomb in front of your chest, and you are still incessantly praising him like this!

	A Kind of Face
	Hu Wanchun
	The rightist throws bombs at the Party, saying that this is what the people want. Once his plot fails, he puts on several hats to cover up, "I, I have a sentimentalist mentality, I am not a rightist."

	Don't Lightly Believe
	Gao Guopei
	Don't believe the enemy's hypocritical tears.
	Don't believe the enemy's feigned repentance.
	You must know that even a sewage ditch will sparkle when the sun shines,
	But behind this sparkle, germs and death are hidden.

	"West River Moon"
	Wen Zhibin
	(Qian Weichang's True Colors)
	Making self-criticisms about trivialities,
	Performing fake plays five times,
	Deceiving people to get away with it,
	Impossible to escape the people's grasp.
	The tone in the initial forum,
	Not a single word mentioned today,
	What intentions are hidden in the anti-Party words?
	Originally a member of the Zhang-Luo right-wing clique.

    诗传单
    “坦白”和“勇敢”
    燕凌“多么坦白，多么勇敢！”对着右派“勇士”的发言，你这样不住口地称赞。“多么坦白，多么勇敢！”他“坦白”地向人民吐着
    唾沫，他“勇敢”地向党射出冷箭。“多么坦白，多么勇敢！”他“坦白”地向敌人宣誓
    忠诚，他“勇敢”地向人民挥
    舞铁拳。
  “多么坦白，多么勇敢！”他已经把炸弹放到你的
    胸前，你还在这样不住口地
    称赞！
    一种嘴脸
    胡万春右派向党掷炸弹他说这是人心大快。一旦事机失败，就扯几顶帽子遮盖，“我，我有温情主义，我可不是右派。”
    不要轻信
    高国沛不要相信敌人虚伪的眼泪不要相信敌人假意的忏悔要知道，出太阳的时候污水沟也会闪光可是在这闪光的后面却隐藏着病菌和死亡
    “西江月”
    文质彬
    （钱伟长本相）检讨鸡毛蒜皮，五次扮唱假戏，蒙混过关把谁欺？难逃人民手底。当初论坛语气，今日只字未提，蓄意反党言何寄？原是章罗右翼。
    （原载清华大学“街头诗”）
