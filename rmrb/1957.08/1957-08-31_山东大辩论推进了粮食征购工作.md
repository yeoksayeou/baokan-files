　　Shandong Great Debate Promotes Grain Procurement

　　(Our dispatch) The Great Debate on the Two Roads of Socialism and Capitalism has been widely and deeply unfolded in Shandong Province. In Laiyang Prefecture, where progress is the fastest, farmers in various counties are enthusiastically engaged in airing views freely, contending and debating; in Changwei, Liaocheng, Huimin, Tai'an and other prefectures, various counties have started or are already unfolding [the debate] at the grassroots level; in the water-stricken areas of Jining, Heze, and Linyi prefectures, various counties will also begin successively.

　　In the previous stage, the effect of conducting socialist education has been clearly seen from the airing of views and debates at pilot points across the province and at the three-level cadre meetings in various counties. That is, rural cadres, party members, Youth League members, activists, and the masses have raised their class consciousness, clearly distinguished between many major rights and wrongs, exposed and refuted the anti-socialist words and deeds of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, etc.; and criticized the capitalist thinking of wealthy middle peasants and the departmentalism and individualism of certain cadres and masses.

　　This ideological education movement has also directly promoted grain procurement work and agricultural production.

　　Because the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and local party committees at all levels attach importance to mastering and leading the movement, the Great Debate across the province is developing healthily to the grassroots level. In individual townships and communes of individual counties, some crude phenomena have also appeared, which is worthy of vigilance. (Xiao Yan)

　　山东大辩论推进了粮食征购工作
    本报讯　山东省已普遍深入展开社会主义和资本主义两条道路的大辩论。进展最快的莱阳专区各县农民，正在热烈进行大鸣大放大辩论；昌潍、聊城、惠民、泰安等专区各县，开始或已经在基层展开；水灾区的济宁、菏泽、临沂专区各县，也将相继开始。
    前一阶段，全省从各地试点及各县三级干部会的鸣辩中，已经明显地看到进行社会主义教育的效果。这就是农村干部、党员、团员、积极分子和群众，提高了阶级觉悟，划清了许多大是大非界限，揭露和驳斥了地主、富农、反革命分子等反社会主义的言行；批判了富裕中农的资本主义思想和某些干部和群众的本位主义、个人主义。
    这次思想教育运动，还直接推动了粮食征购工作和农业生产。
    由于中共山东省委和各级地方党委重视对运动的掌握和领导，全省大辩论正在健康地向基层开展，在个别县的个别乡、社中，也曾出现过某些粗暴的现象，这是值得警惕的。　（肖彦）
