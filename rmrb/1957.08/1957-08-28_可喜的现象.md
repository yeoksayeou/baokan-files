　　A Gratifying Phenomenon

    Watching the diving competition of twenty-three young athletes in the swimming pool stands filled one's heart with joy. They flew down from the three-meter springboard, nimbly performing beautiful movements such as aerial somersaults, twists, and side dives, then gracefully plunged into the water. From their performances, people saw the rapid development of China's diving sport and saw the future and hope.
    In the past few national diving performances and competitions held after liberation, the divers participating were always a few veterans, such as Shanghai athlete Jiang Haoquan, who has more than ten years of diving experience, and Jiangsu Province veteran Xu Xuanrui. There were few newcomers appearing on the springboards and platforms.
    However, in this largest-scale national youth diving competition ever held, a group of young diving athletes with a certain level of skill has emerged, which is a gratifying phenomenon. In the competition, most of them were able to complete the three prescribed diving movements neatly, and a few young athletes not only performed these prescribed movements neatly and gracefully, but also with greater difficulty. In the three optional movements, the young athletes were able to skillfully complete movements such as aerial tumbling, handstands, and turns. Chen Chuanshang, a student from Beijing No. 30 Middle School, is only sixteen years old and has been learning to dive for less than 8 months, but he scored five to six points in each of the six diving movements, with a total score of sixty points, exceeding the standard for a first-class athlete and winning the men's group championship. Liang Rongming, a young athlete from Guangzhou, scored above six points in five diving movements, but failed to win the championship only because he failed to complete the last diving movement of a forward two-and-a-half somersault. In the youth women's diving competition, Wang Xian and Hu Qiuping from Beijing, and Chen Shaoyu from Zhanjiang all performed more difficult diving movements such as a forward one-and-a-half somersault and a backward half twist relatively well.
    In this diving competition, the young athletes generally showed a good foundation. Since most of them have learned gymnastics and received comprehensive physical training, they are very responsive and flexible. Although most of them have been learning to dive for less than a year, they showed that they can spring high from the board and calmly complete somersaults and inversions in the air, and their movements are neat when entering the water. This guarantees that they will rapidly improve their diving skills in the future under the careful guidance and training of the older generation of diving athletes.

　　可喜的现象
　　国安
    在游泳场的看台上，欣赏着二十三名少年运动员的跳水比赛，令人心里充满着喜悦。他们从三公尺的跳板上飞下来，利落地表演着空中倒翻、转体、侧身等优美的动作，然后矫捷地跳入水中。从他们的表演中，人们看到了我国跳水运动的迅速发展，看到了未来和希望。
    解放后举行的几次全国跳水表演和比赛中，参加跳水的运动员总是几名老将，如：有十多年跳水经验的上海运动员蒋浩泉、江苏省的老将许瑔瑞等。出现在跳板上、跳台上的新手是不多的。
    但是，在这一次举行的全国最大规模的少年跳水比赛中，却涌现出一批具有一定水平的少年跳水运动员，这是可喜的现象。他们在比赛中，大多数都能利落地完成比赛规定的三项跳水动作，少数的少年运动员不仅在完成这些规定动作时，动作利落、姿态优美，而且难度都比较大。在三个自选动作中，少年运动员都能灵巧地完成空中翻腾、倒立、转身等动作。北京市三十中学学生陈传尚才十六岁，他学跳水还不到8个月，但是在六项跳水动作中每项都得了五分到六分，总分达到六十分，超过一级运动员的标准，获得了男子组的冠军。广州市少年运动员梁荣明在五项跳水动作中，都得了六分以上，只是在完成最后一项正翻腾二周半的跳水动作失败了，才没有得到冠军。在少年组女子跳水比赛时，北京市的王显、胡秋萍，湛江市的陈少玉都较出色地完成了较难做的正翻腾一周半、向后转体半周等跳水动作。
    在这次跳水比赛中，少年运动员普遍表现了基础打得好。由于他们大多数都学过体操，受过全面的身体锻炼，因此反应很快、身体柔软，虽然大多数的人学跳水不到一年，但在跳水时却表现了从板上弹得高，在空中能从容地完成翻腾，倒转等动作，跳入水中时动作利落。这保证他们今后在老一辈的跳水运动员尽心指导、培养下，将会迅速提高跳水技术。
