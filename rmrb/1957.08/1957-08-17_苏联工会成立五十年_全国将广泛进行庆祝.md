Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has decided to widely celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Trade Unions nationwide in the coming days.

The Soviet Trade Unions were founded in the flames of the first Russian Revolution of 1905-1907.

Materials published in the Soviet press show that the membership of Soviet Trade Unions has now increased to more than 47 million, compared to only 245,000 at its initial founding.

Soviet Trade Unions are currently engaged in studying production and labor productivity, promoting advanced production experience, leading socialist emulation campaigns, and studying and determining quotas, wages, labor protection, and social insurance issues. The trade unions extensively exercise their right to supervise the implementation of housing construction plans by economic institutions, as well as their right to supervise trade work and public catering work.

The production conferences organized by Soviet Trade Unions in enterprises are an important way to attract workers to participate in the management of production. Last year, 6.6 million such conferences were held in enterprises across the country. Workers put forward a large number of suggestions at the meetings. The collective contracts concluded annually between trade union organizations and the administration are also a means for the working people to actively participate in production management.

Soviet Trade Unions have demonstrated great initiative in formulating and implementing measures to further improve the living standards of the working people. Trade unions have been managing the state's social insurance for twenty-five years. This expenditure is constantly increasing, from 20 billion rubles in 1950 to 43 billion rubles at present.

Millions of children of trade union members spend their summer vacations in Young Pioneer camps every year, and the parents pay no more than one-third of the total cost.

To celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Trade Unions this year, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has invited trade union delegations from all socialist countries, as well as trade union delegations from France, Italy, Finland, some Arab countries, and Latin American countries to participate in the celebration ceremonies. A delegation from the World Federation of Trade Unions will also participate in the celebration ceremonies.

    苏联工会成立五十年  全国将广泛进行庆祝
    据新华社莫斯科16日电  全苏工会中央理事会决定在最近几天内在全国广泛庆祝苏联工会成立五十周年。
    苏联工会是在1905—1907年第一次俄国革命的战火中成立的。
    苏联报刊登载的材料表明，目前苏联工会会员已经增加到四千七百多万人，而在它最初成立的时候只有二十四万五千人。
    苏联工会目前从事于研究生产和劳动生产率，推广先进生产经验，领导社会主义竞赛，研究确定定额以及工资、劳动保护和社会保险等问题。工会广泛运用它的对经济机构执行住宅建设计划情况的监督权以及对贸易工作和公共饮食业工作的监督权。
    苏联工会在企业中组织的生产会议是吸引职工参加管理生产的重要方式。去年，全国各企业举行了六百六十万次这类会议。职工在会上提出大量建议。工会组织和行政之间每年缔结的集体合同也是使劳动人民积极参加生产管理的手段。
    苏联工会在拟定和实现进一步提高劳动人民生活水平的措施上表现出很大的主动性。工会管理国家的社会保险已经有二十五年了。这笔费用不断增加，在1950年是两百亿卢布，而目前已经增加到四百三十亿卢布。
    工会会员的成百万子女每年在少先队营里度暑假，而家长所付的费用不超过全部费用的三分之一。
    为庆祝今年的苏联工会成立五十周年，全苏工会中央理事会邀请了所有社会主义国家的工会代表团以及法国、意大利、芬兰、某些阿拉伯国家、拉丁美洲国家的工会代表团前来参加庆祝典礼。世界工会联合会代表团也将参加庆祝典礼。
