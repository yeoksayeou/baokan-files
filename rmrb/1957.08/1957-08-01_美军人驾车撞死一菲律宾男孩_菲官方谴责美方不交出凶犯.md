Xinhua News Agency, Manila, July 31st: According to Philippine Deputy Justice Minister Barrera, U.S. military authorities in the Philippines have once again refused to hand over a U.S. military personnel who caused death by reckless driving to the Philippine judicial authorities for trial.

According to Barrera, the Philippine judicial authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Warrant Officer Carnes of the U.S. Naval Base in Subic Bay.

However, Subic Naval Base Commander Donaho refused to hand over Carnes.

    美军人驾车撞死一菲律宾男孩
    菲官方谴责美方不交出凶犯
    据新华社31日讯　马尼拉7月31日消息：据菲律宾司法部副部长巴雷拉揭露，美国驻菲律宾军事当局最近又拒绝把一个驾车伤人致死的美军人员交给菲律宾司法当局审讯。
    据巴雷拉说，菲律宾司法当局已经发出了逮捕苏比克湾美国海军基地的卡内斯准尉的命令，这个美国海军人员曾经在今年6月28日在三描礼示省的公路上撞伤一个菲律宾男孩，这个男孩后来因伤致死。但是，苏比克海军基地司令多纳霍拒绝把卡内斯交出来。
    巴雷拉指出，多纳霍无视对卡内斯发出的逮捕令是违反了美菲军事基地协定。
    巴雷拉说，菲律宾外交部将在今后几天内就卡内斯案件向美国驻菲律宾大使馆提出强硬的抗议。
