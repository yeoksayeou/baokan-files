　　Kingdom of Afghanistan Independence Day
　　Starting from August 24th, the Kingdom of Afghanistan will hold a week-long Independence Day celebration. The Beijing football team from our country, as well as football teams from India, Iran, and Turkey, will participate in the football matches during this celebration.
　　Independence Day is a day of jubilation for the Afghan people. Thirty-eight years ago, the Afghan people drove the last British invading soldier out of Afghan territory.
　　In the past, Britain regarded Afghanistan as its protectorate. On February 20, 1919, the pro-British Afghan King Habibullah was assassinated; on February 28th of the same month, the new King Amanullah ascended the throne. Immediately after taking the throne, Amanullah declared Afghanistan's complete independence and expressed goodwill towards the Soviet Union. On May 3rd of the same year, the British army launched the criminal Third Anglo-Afghan War. Amanullah's anti-British imperialism struggle was supported by all the tribes of Afghanistan, who launched extensive armed attacks in the British rear and attacked Kabul and Kandahar, which were occupied by the British army. The uprisings of various tribes in the Afghan border area threatened the British rule in the northwestern provinces of India at that time. At this time, the British invading army also suffered a defeat in the war of intervention against the Soviet Union. Therefore, despite the fact that the British army with superior equipment had won several battles, it had to end its military actions on June 3rd under the stubborn blows of the Afghan people. On August 8th of the same year, the two sides signed a preliminary peace treaty, and Britain recognized Afghanistan's independence with a special note. According to the preliminary peace treaty, the British invading army was forced to withdraw from Afghan territory. On November 22, 1921, the Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and Britain was signed in Kabul, and Britain formally recognized Afghanistan's independence and exchanged diplomatic envoys with Afghanistan.
　　The Afghan people commemorate this glorious annual festival with grand military parades, sports competitions, artistic performances, and mass entertainment and games. During each parade, several old cannons used in the anti-aggression war are pushed out by soldiers for everyone to admire, symbolizing the heroic spirit of the Afghan people who have been undefeated in hundreds of battles.

### 阿富汗王国独立节

　　阿富汗王国独立节
    从8月24日开始，阿富汗王国将进行为时一周的独立节庆祝活动。我国的北京足球队和印度、伊朗、土耳其的足球队都要参加这次庆祝活动中的足球比赛。
    独立节是阿富汗人民欢欣鼓舞的日子，三十八年以前，阿富汗人民把最后一个英国侵略兵赶出了阿富汗的领土。
    英国过去把阿富汗当作它的保护国。1919年2月20日，亲英的阿富汗国王哈比布拉被暗杀；同月28日，新王阿曼努拉即位。阿曼努拉继位之后立即宣布阿富汗完全独立，并且向苏联表示亲善态度。同年5月3日，英国军队发动了罪恶的第三次侵阿战争。阿曼努拉的反英帝国主义的斗争得到了阿富汗各部族的支持，他们在英国人的后方发动广泛的武装袭击，并且进攻被英国军队占领的喀布尔和坎大哈。阿富汗边境地带各部族的起义，威胁到当时英国人在印度西北各省的统治。这时，英国侵略军在干涉苏联的战争中也遭到了失败。因此，尽管有着优势装备的英国军队曾经打过几次胜仗，却不得不在阿富汗人民的顽强打击下于6月3日结束了战争行动。同年8月8日，双方签订了初步和约，同时英国用一个特别照会承认了阿富汗的独立。根据初步和约，英国侵略军被迫撤出了阿富汗的领土。1921年11月22日，阿富汗和英国的睦邻条约在喀布尔签字，英国正式确认阿富汗的独立，并且和阿富汗互换外交使节。
    阿富汗人民在这一年一度的光荣节日里，用盛大的阅兵典礼、体育比赛、艺术表演以及大众娱乐和游戏来纪念它。每次阅兵的时候，在反侵略战争中使用过的几门老式的大炮都由士兵们推出来供大家瞻仰，它们标志着阿富汗人民百战不屈的英雄气概。　（新华社）（附图片）
