Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch – Xinhua News Agency headquarters recently held five symposiums and a large meeting to expose and refute a series of reactionary words and deeds by the rightist Dai Huang within the Party, who is anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Soviet.

Dai Huang is a Xinhua News Agency reporter who joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1944. For a long time, he has been dissatisfied with and opposed the Party, even attempting to organize a "Communist Party Revolutionary Committee" to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party. Dai Huang once said that if the Communist Party did not correct its "mistakes," he would organize a new party. According to him, the program and purpose of this new party would be to "eliminate the scissors gap in living standards between cadres and the people," "achieve democracy and freedom," and "eliminate the privileged class." The "privileged class" he referred to was a slander against Chinese Communist Party members and state organ cadres.

Dai Huang's arrogant anti-Party remarks are a series, involving all aspects of the leadership of the CCP Central Committee, the state system, socialist construction, international issues, and the people's journalistic undertakings.

Last November, Dai Huang began writing a "ten-thousand-word letter" (this letter was not yet finished) to the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao, maliciously slandering and attacking the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao. He shamelessly fabricated such "facts": "Apart from rice, the consumption of the 5% of the population who are revolutionaries must be much more than the consumption of the 80% of the population who are farmers!" He maliciously incited: "Pork and cooking oil have all been eaten by Communist Party members and cadres," he shouted: "Our farmers are too bitter, too bitter!" The common people have already "sadly despaired." He even clamored: "The old ruling class has been overthrown, and a new ruling class has risen. If this continues to develop, we might as well merge with Taiwan!"

The spearhead of Dai Huang's attack was directed at the CCP Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and party committees at all levels. He said, "The prevalence of bad cadres and the seriousness of their crimes are not terrible; what is terrible is the bureaucratic style of the upper-level organs." He said that he originally "thought the Central Committee was sober and would quickly do things for the people, who knew it was also the same bureaucrat, bureaucrat!" He even arrogantly believed that the CCP Central Committee should come out and make a self-criticism for creating the current "national shortcomings and errors." He even viciously attacked the CCP Central Committee, saying, "Don't be complacent as an enlightened god!" He arrogantly demanded that the CCP Central Committee be "honest" and "dare to admit its shortcomings."

Even after the start of the anti-rightist struggle, Dai Huang continued to unscrupulously launch vicious attacks on the Party and the state. At a symposium on June 13, he fired the most vicious arrow at the Party, saying that his opinion of the country "can be summarized in five big characters - deification and privilege - this is the root of the country's contradictions." These five big characters are the "theoretical" basis of Dai Huang's anti-Party and anti-socialist thinking.

Dai Huang slandered that leaders at all levels, from the Central Committee to the local areas, believe that "they are above everything" and have "deified themselves." He used all possible means to slander the cadres of the Party and the state, saying that today's cadres are "shitting and pissing on the heads of the people, throwing their weight around and acting like tyrants." He attempted to knock down all the cadres in the country with one blow, insisting that "high-ranking cadres violate laws and regulations, and low-level grassroots cadres are lawless," "doing everything evil except murder and arson." He emphasized that all this "should be the responsibility of the Central Committee." He arrogantly attacked the Chinese people's beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, saying that he had been "suspicious of" Chairman Mao "for a long time," and that since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, he had "begun to suspect that Chairman Mao was making mistakes."

Under everyone's exposure, Dai Huang admitted that his "slanderous statement of the Party's 'deification and privilege' was not casually said, but had been considered for a long time." When comrades questioned him as to why he spread reactionary remarks everywhere, he said that he "wanted to awaken the masses, the purpose was to awaken 'conscientious Party members and League members' to put pressure on the Party to change the status quo." The "change of status quo" that Dai Huang spoke of was the arrogant attempt to organize a "third party" and abolish the Communist Party, which he admitted in the anti-rightist struggle.

Not only that, but Dai Huang also spared no effort to denigrate New China from all aspects. He even regarded today's great construction undertakings of our country as "cursed 'attempts to gain popularity.'" He believed that the construction of the Wuhan Bridge, aircraft factories, and the transformation of the Yellow River were nothing more than "the inevitable result of the continuous development of science and technology in the world" and were not worthy of "pride."

At the same time, Dai Huang also openly stood on the position of imperialism to denigrate the Soviet Union. After the Hungarian incident, Dai Huang opposed the Soviet Union's sending troops to Hungary to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. He confused right and wrong, saying: "If it is right for the Soviet Union to send troops, then it is right for the United States to help Chiang Kai-shek."

Dai Huang launched malicious attacks on the Party's journalistic undertakings. He strongly demanded the abolition of the Party's leadership over journalism and demanded the "independence" of journalism from the Party. He slandered the people's journalistic undertakings as "fooling the people."

Dai Huang also echoed other rightists in society. He believed that Ge Peiqi's statement that he wanted to kill Communist Party members "had its reasons," and he agreed with Zhang Bojun's "political design institute" and Chu Anping's "Party's world" and other fallacies. After the start of the struggle against the rightists, Dai Huang also said: "The harm of the 'three evils' within the Party far exceeds that of the rightists. Why are we not opposing the 'three evils' now but opposing the rightists?"

Dai Huang repeatedly said that he was "the mouthpiece of the people." He said that he "hated to the bone" those who wasted state property and squandered the blood and sweat of the people. However, according to everyone's exposure, he is precisely an extremely selfish and hypocritical person. He has consistently pursued personal fame and status. Last year, Dai Huang received 1,200 yuan in royalties, but he did not pay a penny in Party dues, and squandered and indulged in lavish eating and drinking. When the state and the Party called for the purchase of construction bonds, he only purchased 40 yuan. When he returned to China from his work as a reporter in Vietnam, he over-received two months of foreign wages. Last year, he was extremely dissatisfied that he was not promoted.

Xinhua News Agency staff expressed great indignation at Dai Huang's reactionary words and deeds, and they pointed out that Dai Huang is a thorough rightist; because he was wearing the cloak of a Communist Party member and carrying the banner of a Xinhua News Agency reporter, he caused great harm to the Party's cause. Everyone also revealed that Dai Huang had long stood on the opposite side of the Party and the people. From the moment he entered the city after liberation, he began to make mistakes. Later, during his work as a reporter at home and abroad, he repeatedly made mistakes, and the Party constantly gave him education and criticism, hoping that he would recognize his mistakes and correct them. However, Dai Huang did not accept this education. On the contrary, he harbored deep dissatisfaction with the Party. He either resisted these mistakes in person, or made false self-criticisms and then overturned them, and then attacked the Party even more frantically.

Since last year, Dai Huang has been even more openly confronting the Party everywhere, taking advantage of loopholes everywhere. He even said, "Leadership is bureaucracy," "All those who oppose the leadership are good people," and he expressed that he would fight to the end against what he called the "bureaucratic privileged group." At the same time, after several meetings of exposure, in the face of a large number of facts, Dai Huang also admitted that there was a "small circle" around him that carried out some activities against the leadership and against the Party.

Editors, reporters, and staff of the Xinhua News Agency believe that Dai Huang is a black sheep in the reporter group. They unanimously expressed their determination to continue exposing and criticizing all his anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and deeds, and to make him completely surrender.

    清算这个极狂妄极反动极卑鄙的反党分子
    新华社连日围剿戴煌
    据新华社7日讯　新华通讯社总社最近连续举行了五次座谈会和大会，揭露和驳斥党内右派分子戴煌的反党、反社会主义和反对苏联的一系列的反动言行。
    戴煌是新华社记者，在1944年加入中国共产党。长期以来他就对党不满，反对党，以至企图组织“共产党革命委员会”来推翻中国共产党。戴煌曾说，如果共产党再不改正“错误”的话，他就要组织新党。按照他的说法，这个新党的纲领、目的就是要“消除干部和人民之间的生活剪刀差”、“实现民主自由”和“消灭特权阶级”。他所说的“特权阶级”就是对中国共产党党员和国家机关干部的诬称。
    戴煌狂妄的反党言行是一系列的，它涉及到对中共中央的领导、国家制度、社会主义建设、国际问题以及人民新闻事业等各个方面。
    去年11月，戴煌就开始写给中共中央和毛主席的“万言书”（此信还未写完），对中共中央和毛主席进行了恶毒的诬蔑和攻击。他竟无耻地捏造了这样的“事实”：“除大米之外，占人口5％的革命者的消费量一定会比占人口80％以上的农民的消费量要多得多！”他恶意地煽动说：“猪肉和食油都让共产党员和干部们吃掉了”，他叫喊：“我国的农民是太苦了，太苦了！”老百姓已经“悲痛地失望了”。甚至，他竟这样叫嚣说：“旧的统治阶级被打倒了，新的统治阶级又起来，再发展下去和台湾合并算了！”
    戴煌攻击的矛头集中指向中共中央、毛主席和党的各级领导机关，他说，“坏干部之普遍及其罪行之严重并不可怕，可怕的是上层机关的官僚习气。”他说，他原先“只以为中央是清醒的，会为人民迅速办事的，谁知道也是同样的官僚，官僚！”他竟狂妄地认为，造成目前这种“全国性的缺点和错误”，中共中央应该出来检讨。他甚至恶毒地攻击中共中央说，“不要自负为英明的神吧！”他狂妄地要中共中央“老老实实”，“要敢于承认自己的不足”。
    直到反右派斗争开始以后，戴煌还仍然继续肆无忌惮地向党和国家进行恶毒的攻击。在6月13日的一次座谈会上，他向党放出了一支最恶毒的箭，他说，他对国家的意见，“用五个大字来概括——神化和特权——这就是国家矛盾的根源”。这五个大字，就是戴煌的反党反社会主义思想的“理论”的基础。
    戴煌诬蔑说，自中央到地方，各级领导认为“自己高于一切”，“把自己神化了”。他对党和国家的干部极尽诽谤之能事，他说今天的干部是“在老百姓头上拉屎拉尿，作威作福”。他企图把全国的干部一棍子打死，硬说，“高级干部违法乱纪，低级的基层干部无法无天”，“除杀人放火外，无恶不作”。他强调这一切都“应该由中央负责”。他狂妄地攻击中国人民敬爱的伟大的领袖毛主席，说他对毛主席是“早就怀疑的”，说自从苏共第二十次代表大会以后他就“开始怀疑毛主席犯错误”。
    在大家的揭露下，戴煌承认他“诬蔑党的‘神化和特权’的说法，不是随便说的，而是久经考虑的。”当同志们质问他为什么到处散布反动言论时，他说，他“要唤起群众，目的是要唤起‘有良心的党团员’，对党施加压力，以改变现状。”戴煌所说的“改变现状”，就是他在反右派斗争中所承认的要组织“第三党”、取消共产党的狂妄企图。
    不仅如此，戴煌还不惜从各个方面来诋毁新中国。他甚至把今天我们国家伟大的建设事业也看成是“令人诅咒的‘哗众取宠’的事情”。他认为，建造武汉大桥、飞机工厂和改造黄河，那也不过是“全世界的科学技术不断发展的必然结果”，是不值得“自豪”的。
    同时，戴煌还公然站在帝国主义的立场来诋毁苏联。匈牙利事件发生后，戴煌反对苏联出兵援助匈牙利镇压反革命叛乱。他混淆是非地说：“如果说苏联出兵是对的，那么美国帮助蒋介石也是对的”。
    戴煌对党的新闻事业进行了恶意的攻击。他强烈地要求取消党对新闻事业的领导，向党要求新闻事业的“独立性”。他诬蔑人民新闻事业是“愚民政策”。
    戴煌还同社会上其他右派分子互相呼应。他认为葛佩琦说要杀共产党员的说法“有其道理”，他同意章伯钧的“政治设计院”和储安平的“党天下”等谬论。反击右派的斗争开始以后，戴煌还说：“党内‘三害’的危害性远远超过右派，为什么现在不反‘三害’却反右派？”
    戴煌口口声声说他是“人民的喉舌”。他说，他对浪费国家财产、挥霍人民血汗的人“恨之入骨”。可是，根据大家的揭露，他恰恰是一个极端自私自利的伪君子。他一贯地追求个人名誉地位。去年，戴煌领了一千二百元稿费，一个钱也没有交党费，自己大肆挥霍，大吃大喝。在国家和党号召认购建设公债时，他只认购四十元。他在做驻越南记者回国时，曾经多领了两个月的国外工资。去年他为不给他提级，内心极为不满。
    新华社的工作人员对于戴煌这种种反动言行表示极大的愤慨，他们指出，戴煌是一个彻头彻尾的右派分子；由于他披着共产党员的外衣和打着新华社记者的幌子，给党的事业造成了很大的危害。大家还揭露，戴煌老早就站在同党和人民敌对的立场上。从解放后一进入城市，他就开始犯错误，后来在国内和国外作记者工作期间，又屡犯错误，党曾不断地给予教育和批评，希望他认识错误和改正错误。可是，戴煌不接受这些教育，相反他对党深怀不满，对于屡次所犯的错误，或者当面抗拒，或者假检讨而后推翻，然后更加猖狂地攻击党。
    从去年起，戴煌就更加露骨地处处同党对抗，处处钻空子，他甚至说，“领导就是官僚主义”，“所有反领导的人，都是好人”，他表示要同他所说的“官僚特权集团”斗争到底。同时经过几次会议的揭发，在大量事实面前，戴煌还承认在他的周围有一个“小圈子”，进行了一些反对领导反对党的活动。
    新华社的编辑、记者和工作人员们认为，戴煌是记者群中的害群之马，他们一致表示要决心继续揭露和批判他的一切反党、反人民、反社会主义的言行，要他彻底缴械投降。
