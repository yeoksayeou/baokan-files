Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 23rd (Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Jin): What is the self-esteem of the industrial and commercial circles? This is one of the main contents of the great debate conducted by the industrial and commercial circles of Jiangsu Province with the rightist Qian Sunqing.

After Zhang Naiqi clamored that the industrial and commercial circles had already passed the "five barriers," and that if they still had to "remold their bones," they could not help but become "negatively inferior," Qian Sunqing rose up to echo him, spreading fallacies such as "emphasizing the transformation of the bourgeoisie causes people to lose their self-esteem" and "it is difficult to change one's nature," which "frustrated the enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial circles." Rightists in industrial and commercial circles in Suzhou, Changzhou and other places also launched vigorous activities, shouting "to transform ourselves again, is like being sentenced to life imprisonment," "emphasizing two-sidedness, damages the self-esteem of industrial and commercial circles." After this evil wind of rejecting socialist transformation blew, many industrialists and businessmen in Jiangsu Province lost their way and also believed that the industrial and commercial circles were not popular in the new society, and that further criticism would make them even more looked down upon and would dampen the enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial circles.

In the ten-day great debate with Qian Sunqing, the industrial and commercial circles of Jiangsu Province criticized these fallacies. Zhang Yunxi, deputy director of the Changzhou Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, criticized: Qian Sunqing is using the ideological feelings of the bourgeoisie to maintain the "self-esteem" of the bourgeoisie. Qian Sunqing now wants to pull industrialists and businessmen back to the capitalist road, which in itself shows that the saying "it is difficult to change one's nature" is very appropriate as a metaphor for the difficulty of transforming the bourgeoisie. The fundamental problem of the industrial and commercial circles now is not fear of losing the "self-esteem" of the bourgeoisie, but to further strengthen the transformation and establish the self-esteem of socialism. Gao Jingyue, deputy director of the Wuxi Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: Qian Sunqing's so-called "loss of self-esteem" is sadness that he has lost the interests and prestige of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, and uses "self-esteem" to cover up his anti-communist and anti-socialist ugly face. Chao Fuxie, a representative of the industrial and commercial circles in Changzhou, said at a debate that the self-esteem we industrialists and businessmen pursue is fundamentally different from the "self-esteem" that Qian Sunqing is reluctant to part with. Qian Sunqing is standing on a reactionary position, maintaining the dignity of the bourgeoisie and the landlord class in enslaving and exploiting laborers, while we must strive to transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers. Zhang Jingli, deputy director of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, bravely exposed the ugliness of his bourgeois family background at the Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress in 1955, and was welcomed and encouraged by the representatives of the workers in his factory. However, some industrialists and businessmen reprimanded him for "forgetting his ancestors." When he recalled this incident at the debate, he said: Standing on different class positions, there are completely different views on the same thing. Accepting the leadership of the Party and accepting socialist transformation is the watershed between us industrialists and businessmen and the "self-esteem" Qian Sunqing is talking about.

The facts listed by many industrialists and businessmen in the debate fully illustrate that when industrialists and businessmen work hard to transform themselves and achieve success in their work, they can gain the respect of the people. In the Changzhou Advanced Producers Conference held in 1956, 22 private personnel participated as advanced producers or advanced workers. Cao Ruliang, an industrialist and businessman from Nanjing who participated in this debate, because he actively accepted transformation and took the lead in various movements in the industrial and commercial circles, made achievements in his work, and gained the trust of the people, is now a representative of the Nanjing Municipal People's Congress, a member of the People's Committee, and has been appointed as the deputy director of the Nanjing Municipal Service Bureau.

During the great debate, the Xinhua Daily published an editorial entitled "Transformation is for Self-Esteem," calling on industrialists and businessmen throughout the city to break the self-esteem of the exploiting class and establish the self-esteem of socialists, pointing out the way forward for the industrial and commercial circles of the province.

　　工商界的自尊心是什么？
　　钱孙卿以“自尊”为名掩盖反动面貌
　　江苏工商界进行大辩论加以批判
    新华社南京23日电　新华社记者张瑾报道：工商界的自尊心是什么？是这次江苏省工商界与右派分子钱孙卿进行大辩论的主要内容之一。
    当章乃器叫嚣工商界已经过了“五关”，如果还要“脱胎换骨”，就不能不“消极自卑”之后，钱孙卿便起而呼应，散播所谓“强调资产阶级改造，使人丧失了自尊心”、“江山易改，本性难移”的说法“挫伤了工商界的积极性”等谬论。苏州、常州等地工商界右派分子也大肆活动起来，叫喊“再要脱胎换骨地改造，等于判了无期徒刑”、“强调两面性，有损工商界的自尊”。这一股拒绝社会主义改造的邪风刮起来后，江苏省不少工商业者迷失了方向，也认为工商界在新社会里本来不吃香，再批判就更会被人看不起，就会打击工商界的积极性。
    江苏省工商界在同钱孙卿进行连续十天的大辩论中，批判了他的这些谬论。常州市工商联副主任委员张允溪批判说：钱孙卿是以资产阶级的思想感情来维护资产阶级的“自尊心”的。钱孙卿现在还想将工商业者拉回资本主义道路，这本身就说明了“江山易改，本性难移”这句话，比喻对资产阶级改造的不易，是十分恰当的。工商界现在的根本问题，不是怕失去资产阶级的“自尊心”，而是要进一步加强改造，树立社会主义的自尊心。无锡市工商联副主任委员高景岳说：钱孙卿的所谓“丧失自尊心”，就是伤心他失去了地主、资产阶级的利益和威风，以“自尊”来掩盖他反共、反社会主义的丑恶面貌。常州市工商界代表巢福偕在一次辩论会上发言说，我们工商业者所追求的自尊心，与钱孙卿恋恋不舍的“自尊心”，有根本的区别。钱孙卿是站在反动立场上，维护资产阶级和地主阶级奴役和剥削劳动者的尊严，而我们是要努力改造成为自食其力的劳动者。省工商联副主任委员张敬礼1955年在江苏省人民代表大会会议上，勇敢地暴露了他的资产阶级家世的丑恶之后，受到他所在工厂的职工代表的欢迎与鼓励，但是，有些工商业者却斥责他为“数典忘祖”。他在辩论会上回忆这件事的时候说：站在不同阶级立场上，对同样的事情，有截然不同的看法。接受党的领导，接受社会主义改造，是我们工商业者与钱孙卿所说的“自尊心”的分水岭。
    许多工商业者在辩论中所列举的事实，充分地说明：当工商业者努力改造自己，工作有成绩的时候，就能得到人民的尊重。常州市在1956年召开的先进生产者大会中，有二十二位私方人员作为先进生产者或先进工作者参加。这次参加辩论的南京市工商业者曹汝亮，因为积极接受改造，在工商界各种运动中起了带头作用，工作做出成绩，得到了人民的信任，现在是南京市人民代表，人民委员会委员，并且被任命为南京市服务局副局长。
    在大辩论期间，新华日报以“改造是为了自尊”为题发表社论，号召全市工商业者破剥削阶级的自尊心，立社会主义者的自尊心，为全省工商界指明了前进的道路。
