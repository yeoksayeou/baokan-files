Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 11th: Following the rectification of grain unified sales work, Shanghai's grain sales volume has gradually declined. The city's total grain sales in the second quarter decreased by 25.99 million jin compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and last month decreased by 29.9 million jin compared to January of this year. The unreasonable increase in grain sales volume that appeared in the third and fourth quarters of last year has been reversed, and the sales situation is trending towards normal.

In a period of more than a month starting in late March this year, Shanghai conducted a comprehensive inspection and rectification of grain unified sales and a publicity and education campaign on saving grain. More than 560,000 households and 5,800 collective canteens in the city formulated grain saving plans and agreements. Since April, the amount of grain that residents have saved within the scope of rationed supply has been more than 1 million jin per month, and the surplus grain turned over to the state by collective canteens has also exceeded the planned amount every month. In the first half of this year, more than 8 million jin of surplus grain was turned over. Some grain-consuming units actively used grain substitutes, saving a total of 1.08 million jin of grain in the first half of this year.

Currently, the Municipal Grain Department has begun to focus on spot-checking the grain consumption of collective canteens in factories, enterprises, government agencies, organizations, schools, and hospitals. From the units that have been inspected, most units attach great importance to saving grain. However, it has also been found that some units still have grain waste, especially since the beginning of summer, when the weather is hot, and the phenomenon of grain spoilage and dumping is even more serious. After the inspection work is completed, the Shanghai Municipal Grain Department will take measures to further eliminate loopholes in grain waste.

    上海粮食销售量逐渐下降
    上缴节余粮食八百多万斤
    新华社上海11日电　经过整顿粮食统销工作以后，上海市粮食销售量逐渐下降。第二季度全市粮食总销量比去年第四季度下降了二千五百九十九万斤，上个月又比今年1月份下降了二千九百九十万斤。去年三、四季度出现的粮食销售量不合理上升的局面已经改变，销售情况趋向正常。
    今年3月下旬以后的一个多月中，上海曾经全面进行了一次粮食统销的检查整顿工作和节约粮食的宣传教育工作，全市有五十六万多户居民和五千八百多个伙食团分别订了节约粮食计划和公约。居民户4月份以来在定量供应范围内节约下来少买的粮食数量，每月都在一百万斤以上，伙食团上缴给国家的节余粮也月月超额完成计划。今年上半年上缴的节余粮就有八百多万斤。部分用粮单位积极利用粮食代用品，今年上半年共节约了粮食一百零八万斤。
    目前，市粮食部门已开始重点抽查工厂、企业、机关、团体、学校、医院等伙食团的用粮情况。从已经检查的单位来看，大多数单位对节约粮食是很重视的。但是也发现部分单位仍旧有浪费粮食的现象，特别是入夏以来，天气炎热，粮食变质倒掉的现象更加严重。检查工作结束以后，上海市粮食部门将采取措施进一步杜绝浪费粮食的漏洞。
