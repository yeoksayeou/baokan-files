    Qingdao Naval Club recently trained a group of young "motorboat" athletes. "Motorboat" sports can cultivate young people's courage, resourcefulness, and perseverance. Such training is the first of its kind in Qingdao. The athletes participating in the training have learned the theory of boat handling, nautical knowledge, and practical driving skills during a one-month short-term training period from July 15th to August 15th, and have basically mastered the driving techniques. Now, they are using their vacation time to carry out practical operations and exercises to meet the standards of "motorboat" athletes.

    青岛航海俱乐部最近训练了一批青年“摩托艇”运动员。“摩托艇”运动可以培养青年人勇敢机智和坚毅。这样的训练在青岛还是首次举行。参加训练的运动员们，从7月15日到8月15日一个月的短期训练中，已学习了操艇理论、航海常识和实际驾驶等方面的知识，并基本上掌握了驾驶技术。现在，他们正利用假期进行实际操作和练习，以达到合乎“摩托艇”运动员的标准。
