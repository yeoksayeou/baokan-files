    Shanghai's Over 600 Organizations Continue Rectification
    Big-Character Posters are an Important Form for the Masses to Express Opinions; Mass Blooming and Contending Forms a Surge
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shanghai on the 14th) Our newspaper's reporter Xi Ping reports: After initially repelling the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements, party organizations in more than 600 organs and organizations at the district and municipal levels in Shanghai have universally launched rectification movements. According to statistics, approximately 150,000 staff members of these organs are involved in this movement.
    A fervent democratic surge of mass blooming and contending has formed in various organs and organizations. Big-character posters are an important form widely adopted by the masses to express their opinions. When the reporter visited some organs, he saw all kinds of big-character posters plastered everywhere on both sides of the doorways and corridors. The content of the criticisms on the big-character posters is extremely broad. Some criticize the biases of party organizations in implementing policies, some raise problems in actual work, and some criticize some bad ideological work styles of individual party members and party leading cadres. On the big-character posters of the Electric Machinery Bureau, two technicians criticized the leadership of the Electric Machinery Bureau for not paying attention to the manufacturing work of a complete set of ramie textile equipment. Several comrades in charge of labor protection work criticized by name on the big-character posters that the leadership usually does not care about labor protection work. On the big-character posters of the Shanghai No. 1 Commercial Bureau, someone criticized by name some ideological work styles of the party member bureau chief.
    Many criticisms from the masses sharply touched on important shortcomings in the work of the party organizations of some departments, which will greatly help the party's rectification. For example, cadres of the Changning District Committee of the CPC criticized that the district committee's institutions were excessively large and too many organ cadres were concentrated. The public-private joint venture industry department of this district committee has six ministers and dozens of cadres, but several public-private joint venture factories in the district with over a thousand workers do not have enough leading backbone. The critics demanded that the district committee send cadres to lower levels. In the mass criticisms in various organs, there are also a few opinions that are wrong or extreme, and some are anti-socialist remarks, but these opinions are allowed to be published.
    The rectification movement in Shanghai's organs began as early as mid-May, but after the anti-rightist struggle was launched in June, the rectification movement in some organs was temporarily suspended for a period of time, and is now continuing on the original basis. Judging from the current situation of the rectification movement in various organs in Shanghai, after this period of tempering in the anti-rightist struggle, the ideological level and political consciousness of the masses have generally improved, and the relationship with the party has become closer. As soon as some organs announced rectification, the vast majority of the masses put forward opinions to the party in the spirit of cherishing the party. Some organs often receive hundreds of opinions and post dozens of big-character posters in one day. The vast majority of these opinions are well-intentioned, correct, or largely correct. The Putuo District Committee of the CPC analyzed more than 2,900 opinions from sixty-one units. Among them, more than 2,600 opinions were correct, and extreme, untrue, and anti-socialist opinions accounted for only a very small number. It can also be seen from this blooming and contending that after the great storm of the anti-rightist struggle, the political discernment ability of many people has improved, and rightist remarks are no longer easy to find a market.
    In order to fully develop mass blooming and contending, Shanghai currently emphasizes two points: First, party members who are in charge of administrative leadership at all levels of the organs must listen to various opinions with an open mind and sincerity, and must also listen patiently to incorrect or even wrong opinions at the beginning. Secondly, it is particularly emphasized that the boundary between rightist remarks and extreme opinions must be clearly drawn, which is an important key to uniting the middle masses and avoiding mistakes. In order to prevent this deviation from arising, it is advocated to have great debate and seek truth from facts in blooming and contending, and it is not allowed to "put labels" arbitrarily.

    上海六百多个机关团体继续整风
    大字报是群众发表意见的重要形式　群众性的大鸣大放已经形成热潮
    本报上海14日电　本报记者习平报道：在初步击退右派分子的猖狂进攻之后，上海市市区两级的六百多个机关、团体的党组织，已普遍展开了整风运动。据统计，卷入这个运动的机关工作人员约十五万人左右。
    群众性的大鸣大放已在各个机关、团体中形成了一个热烈的民主热潮。大字报是群众普遍采用的发表意见的一个重要的形式。记者在参观一些机关时，只见门口走道两旁，到处都贴满了形形色色的大字报。大字报上批评的内容也极为广泛，有的批评党组织在执行政策中的偏向，有的提出实际工作中的问题，有的批评个别党员和党员负责干部的一些不良思想作风。在电机局的大字报上，两位技术人员批评了电机局领导上不重视全套苎麻纺织设备的制造工作。几个经管劳动保护工作的同志在大字报上指名批评了领导上平时不关心劳动保护工作。在上海第一商业局的大字报上，有人指名批评了党员局长的一些思想作风。
    群众的许多批评，都尖锐地触及了一些部门党组织工作中的重要缺点，这将大大有助于党的整风。如中共长宁区委的干部批评了区委的机构过分庞大，机关干部集中过多。这个区委的公私合营工业部有六个部长和几十个干部，但区内几个拥有上千工人的公私合营工厂却没有足够的领导骨干。批评者要求区委把干部下放。在各机关群众性的批评中，也有少数意见是错误或偏激的，也有些是反社会主义的言论，但这些意见都允许他们发表。
    上海各机关的整风运动早从5月中旬就开始了，但6月份反右派斗争开展后，有些机关的整风运动暂时停顿了一个时期，现在在原有的基础上正继续进行。从目前上海各机关整风运动的情况看来，经过这一时期的反右派斗争的锻炼以后，群众的思想水平和政治觉悟普遍提高，和党的关系也更加亲密了。许多机关一经宣布整风，绝大多数群众就本着爱护党的精神，向党提出意见。有些机关常常在一天之内就收到几百条意见，贴出几十张大字报。这些意见绝大部分都是善意的、正确或大体正确的。中共普陀区委分析了六十一个单位的二千九百余条意见。其中有二千六百多条意见都是正确的，偏激、与事实不符和反社会主义的意见只占极少数。从这次鸣放中也看到：经过反右派斗争的大风大浪之后，许多人的政治辨别能力提高了，右派言论已不大容易找到市场。
    为了使群众性的鸣放能充分展开，上海目前强调了两点：一是机关各级担任行政领导工作的党员必须虚心诚恳地倾听各种意见，对于不正确的、甚至错误的意见在开始时也必须耐心听取。其次，特别强调了划清右派言论和偏激意见之间的界线，这是团结中间群众、避免错误的重要关键。为了防止这个偏向的产生，此间在鸣放中提倡大争大辩，实事求是，不准随意“戴帽子”。
