    Night-Shining Pearl
  Night-shining pearl,
  Is a treasure,
  Whoever gets it will be happy.
  Chairman Mao,
  Sent uncles,
  Sending ten thousand night-shining pearls.
  In the village,
  Pillars are erected,
  Each pillar has a pearl.
  Thousands of pearls, tens of thousands of pearls,
  The night sky of the hometown turns into white jade.
  Grandpa and Grandma can't close their mouths,
  The mountain village will have no dark roads from now on.
  Duck Herding Girl on the River
  The boat is swaying, on the boat is a young woman.
  The young woman has rosy cheeks,
  Graduated last year and returned to her hometown.
  Returning to her hometown, she works hard,
  She fell in love with a group of ducklings.
  The young woman, poling the boat,
  The ducks she releases are plump and fat.
  Releasing while singing,
  Singing from dawn till the stars shine.

    农村儿歌
    李作华
    夜明珠
  夜明珠，
  是宝物，
  谁能得到谁幸福。
  毛主席，
  派叔叔，
  送来万颗夜明珠。
  村子里，
  竖起柱，
  一棵柱子一棵珠。
  千颗珠，万颗珠，
  家乡夜空变白玉。
  爷奶嘴，合不住，
  山村从此无黑路。
  牧鸭姑娘河面上，
  船儿荡，船上有位大姑娘。
  大姑娘，红脸膛，
  去年毕业回家乡。
  回家乡，劳动强，
  一群小鸭子她爱上。
  大姑娘，撑着船，
  放出的鸭子肥胖胖。
  一边放，一边唱，
  从早唱到星光亮。
