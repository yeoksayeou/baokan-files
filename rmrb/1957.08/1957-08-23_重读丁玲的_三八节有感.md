    Rereading Ding Ling's "Thoughts on March 8th"
    Ling Xiaohua
    Ding Ling published an essay titled "Thoughts on March 8th" on March 9, 1942, in the Yan'an "Liberation Daily." In that article, Ding Ling had already openly launched a poisonous arrow at the Party. Fifteen years later, as the Ding Ling anti-Party clique is being exposed, rereading this article makes one's eyes seem much clearer, allowing one to see through the soul of this vicious anti-Party careerist.
    What exactly did Ding Ling's "Thoughts on March 8th" "feel"?
    In this article, you cannot detect the slightest scent of a Communist Party member, the slightest scent of proletarian collectivism, the slightest scent of revolution, or the slightest scent of resistance against Japan. Ding Ling did not propose any revolutionary tasks for women, did not express any hatred for the enemies of the women's masses and the entire people, and did not express any love for the struggle of the women's masses and the entire people. On the contrary, revolutionary political struggle, the truth that women's liberation must be achieved after the people gain political power—all of this became the target of her ridicule and slander. She would rather give "tolerance" to "female criminals" than miss an opportunity to curse the Party and the revolution. In fact, Ding Ling, taking advantage of the period in 1942 when the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek were compromising, jointly opposing the Communist Party, and besieging the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, cursed the Party and its cause by using the women's issue, calling on "women" (and also "men") to rise up against the Party and its cause. People will certainly also remember that during that same period, she also published "Wild Lily," which viciously slandered the Party and the revolution, in the supplement she edited.
    Ding Ling's anti-Party tactic at the time was to curse the bright and vigorous Party and the cause created by the broad laboring people, the new society it led, as a complete darkness. What Ding Ling promoted was only the dark psychology and hatred of a very small number of disgruntled elements, only the feelings of hesitation and fear in the face of difficulties of some people whose revolutionary will had declined. As for her "depictions" of the relationship between "leaders" and ordinary staff, the relationship between artists and politicians, the relationship between intellectuals and worker-peasant cadres, the issues of male-female marriage and social interaction, the relationship between parents and children, etc., they were completely provocation and slander. It is not difficult to understand that if Yan'an at that time was really as she described it, worse than the "old society," how could it have become the leading center of the victorious anti-Japanese struggle and democratic struggle? How could it have overcome the serious difficulties? How could it have cultivated so many strong and loyal revolutionary cadres? How could it have quickly crushed the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek encirclement and finally achieved complete victory? How could it have "fed the female comrades so red and plump"? How could there have been Ding Ling scolding the female comrades' "enjoyment," "satisfaction," "comfort," "cuteness," "poeticness," "happiness," to the point where Ding Ling had to come out and advocate so-called "not bitter, then degenerate"?
  The facts are the opposite of Ding Ling's slander. At that time, the vast majority of male and female comrades, under the leadership of the Party, were full of energy, united as one, overcoming difficulties, continuously advancing their careers, improving their lives year by year, and gradually developing new moral customs. The songs, laughter, joyful gatherings, intimate conversations, earnest criticisms, and serious work along the Yan River, selfless labor... along with the Yan River's flowing water, mountains, every grass and tree... make it unforgettable forever! How many great hearts have leaped here! The so-called "female criminals" whom Ding Ling called at that time are now the backbone of all aspects of our country, and as for the children who were raised in difficult years, they have now grown up healthily in body and mind, and they, like millions of young people, are the hope of our country's future!
    What exactly could Ding Ling's anti-Party curses in "Thoughts on March 8th" shake in the Party? Perhaps she also foresaw at the time that there would be no result in this regard, so although she "persisted to the end" with gritted teeth, she inevitably felt desperately lonely, so she spat it out in such a "bitter" tone. Her article was met with sharp rebuttal from the Party and all upright Party members, but the Kuomintang special agent-run "Unified Publishing House" quickly extracted it and "Wild Lily" into a book and distributed it in large quantities to vigorously attack the Communist Party. This fact is the most powerful illustration of who this article was beneficial to!
    Few readers today have probably read this article, so it is worthwhile to republish it. Because this can help everyone understand what kind of Communist Party member and what kind of writer Ding Ling really was, and how Ding Ling's anti-Party words and deeds have been consistently consistent.

    重读丁玲的“三八节有感”
    凌晓华
    丁玲在1942年3月9日发表了一篇题为“三八节有感”的杂文，登在延安“解放日报”上。在那篇文章里，丁玲就已经公开地向党放出一支毒箭。十五年后的今天，正当丁玲反党集团被揭露的时候，重读这篇文章，眼睛好像又明亮了许多，把这个恶毒的反党野心家的灵魂看透了。
    丁玲的“三八节有感”“感”了些什么呢？
    在这篇文章里，你无法闻出一点共产党员的气味，一点无产阶级的集体主义的气味，一点革命的气味，抗日的气味。丁玲对妇女没有提出任何革命性的任务，对妇女群众和整个人民群众的敌人没有表现任何恨，对妇女群众和整个人民群众的斗争事业没有表现任何爱。相反，革命的政治斗争，妇女解放必须在人民取得政权以后取得的真理，这一切全都成为她的嘲笑污蔑的目标。她宁愿把“宽容”给予“女犯”，却不愿放松一个机会来咒骂党和革命。实际上，丁玲是趁着1942年间日蒋妥协、共同反共、围攻陕甘宁边区的时候，乘党处在困难中，借妇女问题咒骂党和党的事业，号召“女人”（也号召“男人”）起来反对党和党的事业。人们当然也会记得：也是在那个时期，她还在由她编的副刊上发表了恶毒地诋毁党和革命的“野百合花”。
    丁玲当时反党的手法，是把光明奋发的党和广大劳动人民所创造的事业，所领导的新社会，咒骂成漆黑一团。丁玲所宣扬的，只是绝少数不满分子的阴暗心理、仇恨心理，只是一些革命意志衰退的人在困难前动摇、害怕的心情。至于她对“首长”和一般工作人员的关系、艺术家和政治家的关系、知识分子和工农干部的关系、男女婚姻社交问题、父母对待子女关系等等的“描写”，则完全是挑拨和污蔑。不难理解，当时的延安，如果真像她所说成的那样，不如“旧的社会”，怎么能成为胜利的抗日斗争和民主斗争的领导中心？怎么能把严重的困难克服过来？怎么能培养出那么多坚强的忠心耿耿的革命干部？怎么能很快地粉碎了日蒋围攻并且终于获得了全面的胜利？怎么能“把女同志吃得那么红胖”？怎么会有丁玲连骂女同志们的“享乐”、“满足”、“舒服”、“可爱”、“有诗意”、“幸福”以至需要丁玲出而提倡所谓“不悲苦，即堕落”？
  事实和丁玲的污蔑正相反。当时绝大多数的男女同志，在党领导下精神焕发，大家一条心，克服困难，事业不断前进，生活逐年改善，新的道德风尚逐步成长。延河边的歌声，笑声，欢乐的聚会，亲切的倾谈，恳切的批评，严肃的工作，忘我的劳动……和着延河的流水、群山、一草一木……使人永远难忘！这里曾跳跃过多少颗伟大的心！丁玲当时所称为“女犯”的，现在是我们国家各方面的骨干，至于在艰难岁月中所抚养成人的孩子们，现在身、心方面都已经茁壮地成长起来，他们和千百万青年一样，是我们国家未来的希望！
    丁玲“三八节有感”的反党的咒骂，到底能动摇党什么呢？大概她当时也预感到在这上面不会有什么结果，所以虽然咬牙切齿地“坚持到底”，但究竟不免感到绝望的孤独，所以用那么“悲苦”的调子吐出。她的文章受到了党和一切正直的党员的尖锐的驳斥，但是国民党特务办的“统一出版社”却很快就把它同“野百合花”摘印成书大量散发，来大肆攻击共产党。这个事实，就是最有力地说明了这篇文章是有利于什么人的！
    现在的读者，看过这篇文章的大概很少了，因此，如果把它再发表一下，是值得的。因为这可以帮助大家认识丁玲究竟是一个什么样的共产党员和什么样的作家，以及丁玲的反党言行是怎样始终一贯的。
