The Chinese Exhibition Hall in Morocco
Wen Shizhen, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Casablanca International Exposition

The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade participated in the Casablanca International Exposition for the first time this May, after Morocco's independence.

The Moroccan government attached great importance to China's participation in this Casablanca International Exposition. When I arrived at the port of Casablanca, the Moroccan government specially sent the Director of the Casablanca Port Commercial Bureau from the Ministry of National Economy and the Chief of Protocol from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as representatives to greet me at the airport. It is said that in the history of the exposition, this was the first time that the head of the delegation was greeted by official representatives. Before the opening of the Chinese Pavilion, Mr. Fassi, Chairman of the Istiqlal Party, and many important officials visited the Chinese Pavilion to express their concern for the preparations. On May 4th, the first day of the exposition, the King, Prime Minister, and ministers of Morocco first visited the Chinese Pavilion. On May 6th, Chinese Pavilion Day, the King visited for the second time with his wife and daughters.

The Moroccan people have a great interest in the Chinese Exhibition Hall. During the sixteen days of the exposition, the Chinese Pavilion was visited by more than 1.2 million people. Every day at 10:00 a.m., as soon as the exposition opened, large crowds of visitors poured into the Chinese Pavilion; and ten minutes before the closing at 1:00 a.m., thousands of visitors were still reluctant to leave, admiring their favorite exhibits in the hall. More than 6,000 complimentary remarks and thoughts written in the guestbook, and dozens of articles published in various newspapers reporting on the Chinese Pavilion, showed the Moroccan people's satisfaction after visiting the Chinese Pavilion. Barka, Speaker of the Moroccan National Consultative Assembly, wrote in the guestbook: "The handicrafts displayed in the Chinese Pavilion embody your ancient culture, but the exhibited machines and heavy industrial products show that the sun has risen from the East." The "Al-Alam" newspaper, the organ of the Istiqlal Party, said that "everything in the Chinese Pavilion is surprising and worthy of attention." "Casablanca News" wrote: "In our opinion, the Chinese Pavilion is at least one of the most amazing pavilions at the exposition. Because it showcases the brilliant progress of five thousand years of civilization and modern equipment in production. Moreover, it has not lost the artistic style passed down through generations for thousands of years due to this progress."

The deep friendship of the Moroccan people towards the Chinese people left us with a deep impression. Many visitors said to us: "Coming to the Chinese Pavilion is like coming to China. I want to live here and don't want to leave." Many people shouted to us as soon as they saw us: "Bai Yi Lai Xi Ni, O Mo E Ni Bi (meaning long live friendship)." Why do the Moroccan people have a special affectionate feeling for the Chinese Pavilion? "The Chinese Pavilion shows the hope of the East and allows the Moroccan people to see their future!" This passage written by a Moroccan visitor in the guestbook can be used to answer this question.

Among the exhibits, the heavy industrial products were most appreciated by the audience. Many people couldn't help but shake hands with our staff to congratulate them when they saw Chinese-made machines, and some even excitedly shouted the slogan "Long live China." Islamic cultural relics also aroused special interest among the audience. They were very surprised that China could print the Koran. Every day, many viewers asked us for the album "The Life of Chinese Muslims." They were very happy to know that Chinese Muslims enjoy full religious freedom. In the guestbook, almost every day someone wrote down their greetings to Chinese Muslims.

The visitors to the Chinese Pavilion were not only friends from Morocco. On the opening day, five Algerians (two of whom were women) said to the exhibition delegation: "We have come here specifically to congratulate the successful opening of the Chinese Pavilion and to thank the Chinese people for their support of the Algerian people's struggle." Hussein Aman, a middle school teacher from Guinea, said: "Now all the people of Africa are yearning for China, because China's today is Africa's future and hope."

There are not many overseas Chinese in Morocco, and they are scattered all over the country. They all rushed to visit the Chinese Pavilion. They have a deep affection for their motherland and are proud of the great progress made by their motherland in recent years. An old overseas Chinese, Cai Zongzhai, said: "I lived in the countryside when I was young. After leaving the motherland, I never dreamed that my country could manufacture machines. Today, I am so excited to see the progress of the motherland's construction. Please, after you return to China, please send our regards to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and the people of the whole country." When a young overseas Chinese, Zhang Shuxia, received a "Beijing" album that we gave him, he jumped up excitedly and said: "This is my heart!"

During the exhibition, we also conducted some trade activities. Chinese green tea is the most popular drink among the Moroccan people, and it is also Morocco's main import commodity. In order to meet the demands of the Moroccan people, we specially set up a Chinese tea pavilion near the exhibition hall. In addition to selling tea, we also provided free tea to visitors. Every day, there was always a long queue in front of the tea pavilion; more than 33,000 packets of tea were sold in more than ten days. We had extensive contacts with Moroccan businessmen.

The exhibition of the Chinese Exhibition Hall in Morocco has enhanced the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Moroccan people. I believe that the economic ties and friendly exchanges between China and Morocco will be further developed in the future. (Attached picture)

    中国展览馆在摩洛哥
    中国参加卡萨布兰卡  国际博览会展览团团长  文士桢
    中国国际贸易促进委员会今年5月第一次参加了摩洛哥独立后的卡萨布兰卡国际博览会。
    中国参加这次卡萨布兰卡国际博览会受到了摩洛哥政府的特别重视。当我到达卡萨布兰卡港时，摩洛哥政府国民经济部特派卡萨布兰卡港商业局长、外交部特派礼宾司长为代表到机场迎接。据说，在博览会的历史上，由官方代表迎接展览团长，这还是第一次。在中国馆开始展出以前，摩洛哥独立党主席法席和不少重要官员都到中国馆来访问，对中国馆的筹备工作表示关怀。5月4日，博览会开幕的第一天，摩洛哥国王、首相和大臣们首先参观了中国馆。5月6日为中国馆日，国王又携妻女第二次前来参观。
    摩洛哥人民对中国展览馆有极大的兴趣。在博览会展出十六天中，中国馆的参观者共一百二十万人以上。每天上午十时博览会一开馆，大批观众就涌进了中国馆；而在夜半一时闭馆前十分钟，还有数千观众恋恋不舍的在馆内欣赏他们心爱的展品。留言簿上写下的六千多条赞语和感想，各报发表的几十篇报道中国馆情况的文章，显示出摩洛哥人民参观中国馆后的满意心情。摩洛哥国民协商议会议长巴尔卡在留言簿上写道：“中国馆所陈列的手工艺品本身就体现了你们有着古老的文化，但展出的机器和重工业产品则显示着太阳已从东方升起。”独立党机关报“旗帜报”说中国馆的“一切都使人惊讶和重视”。“卡萨布兰卡人报”这样写道：“在我们看来，中国馆至少是博览会中最令人惊异的馆之一。因为它展示了五千年来的文明和生产方面现代化装备的光辉进步。而且并未因这种进步而失去几千年来世代留传下来的艺术风格。”
    摩洛哥人民对中国人民的深厚友谊给我们留下了深刻的印象。有许多观众对我们说：“来到中国馆就好像到了中国。想住在这里，不愿意离开了。”很多人一见着我们就喊：“白依来希尼，哦默额尼比（即友好万岁的意思）。”为什么摩洛哥人民对于中国馆有着特别亲切的感情呢？“中国馆显示了东方的希望，使摩洛哥人民看到了他们的未来！”一位摩洛哥的参观者在留言簿上写下的这段话，可以用来答复这个问题。
    在展品中，最使观众赞赏的是重工业产品。很多人看到中国自制的机器时，就情不自禁地向我们的工作人员握手致贺，有的甚至还兴奋地高呼“中国万岁”的口号。伊斯兰教文物也使观众特别感到兴趣。他们非常惊奇中国能够印制可兰经。每天都有许多观众向我们要“中国穆斯林生活”画册。他们很高兴知道中国穆斯林享受着充分的宗教信仰自由。在留言簿上，几乎每天都有人写下了他们对中国穆斯林的问候。
    到中国馆来参观的观众，并不仅仅是摩洛哥的朋友们。在开幕那天，有五位阿尔及利亚人（其中二位是女的）向展览团说：“我们特地前来祝贺中国馆的胜利开幕，并且感谢中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民斗争的支持。”一位来自畿内亚的中学教员侯赛尼·阿曼这样说：“现在全非洲人民都在向往着中国，因为中国的今天就是非洲的未来和希望。”
    华侨在摩洛哥人数不多，散居各地。他们都纷纷赶来参观中国馆，他们对祖国有深厚的感情，因为祖国几年来的巨大进步而感到骄傲。一位老华侨蔡宗斋说：“我小时住在农村，离开祖国后从来没有梦想到自己国家能够制造机器。今天看到祖国建设的进步，太兴奋了。请你们回国后代我们问候毛主席、周总理及全国人民。”当一位青年华侨张叔夏接到我们送给他一本“北京”画册时，他兴奋地跳起来说：“这是我的心呀！”
    在展览期间，我们也进行了一些贸易活动。中国绿茶是摩洛哥人民最喜爱的，而且也是摩洛哥的最主要的入口商品。为了满足摩洛哥人民的要求，我们曾在展览馆附近特设了一个中国茶亭，除了卖茶以外，还免费供给观众饮茶。每天，在茶亭前总是排着长长的队伍；十多天中共卖出了三万三千多包茶叶。我们和摩洛哥商人进行了广泛的接触。
    中国展览馆这次在摩洛哥的展出，增进了中摩两国人民的相互了解和友谊。我相信，中摩两国的经济联系和友好往来今后将得到进一步的发展。（附图片）
