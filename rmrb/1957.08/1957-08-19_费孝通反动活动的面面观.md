A Long-Standing Conspiracy with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji to Restore Capitalism

In the early days after liberation, Fei Xiaotong wrote an article titled "My Year," which "superficially acknowledged China's democracy, but his feelings had not changed," and "he still yearned for bourgeois democracy in his heart." Due to the tense class struggle situation at home and abroad at that time, his attempts at resistance were "sealed" in his "heart," but he immediately rose up to resist whenever there was an opportunity. For example, he once made such a "bold statement": "I will first affirm the National People's Congress, and then 'transform' it." He wanted to "transform" the National People's Congress into a "Parliament" (i.e., a bourgeois parliament). Also, in 1951, when the government was about to implement the restructuring of departments and colleges, he conspired with American spy Zhang Dongsun and right-wing elements such as Pan Guangdan and Wu Jingchao to oppose it, which delayed the restructuring work by one year.

After the general line was announced in 1953, Zhang Bojun everywhere advocated: "In the future, there will only be workers, peasants, and intellectuals in society, and democratic parties must become parties of intellectuals." Luo Longji, who had always been vying for power with Zhang Bojun within the China Democratic League, immediately echoed Zhang's proposal, and Fei Xiaotong also began to collude further with Luo Longji from this time on. Because Zhang and Luo's direction was exactly Fei Xiaotong's direction, and Zhang and Luo's methods were exactly Fei Xiaotong's method of first "affirming it" and then "transforming it" (by "transforming" the democratic parties into bourgeois right-wing intellectual parties, and then "transforming" socialism into capitalism). In October 1955, Fei Xiaotong suggested to the Central Committee of the China Democratic League to adopt the method of networking to understand the problems of intellectuals. Based on the five or six networking sessions conducted in Beijing, he wrote two comprehensive reports, which distortedly reflected the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, the consequences of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and so on. He secretly infiltrated his own rotten thoughts and intentions into them, constructing a bleak picture, using individual, seemingly objective and practical "examples" to provoke the relationship between the Party and intellectuals.

In the first half of 1956, socialist countries adopted a series of major measures in democratic life. Fei Xiaotong believed that he could "open up anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds," so "the bourgeois thoughts and emotions that had been suppressed in his heart in the past further emerged," and he actively engaged in anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracy activities.

The Reactionary Political Line of the Zhang-Luo Alliance was Devised by Fei Xiaotong

In August 1956, Fei Xiaotong, in his capacity as Deputy Director of the State Council Expert Bureau and Minister of the Culture and Education Department of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, went to the Southwest to engage in "intellectuals' work" and "inspect league affairs." During this trip to the Southwest, he did two major things for the Zhang-Luo alliance: First, he discovered from the inspection that the China Democratic League as an organization "has a role," "has strength," and "has talents," and can "speak out for justice" for intellectuals and exercise "supervision" over the Party. That is to say, it is really possible to start organizing a political party of intellectuals; Second, from the networking activities, he further figured out a more complete organizational line, action program, and work policy needed by the Zhang-Luo alliance to expand its influence and power among intellectuals. After returning from the Southwest, Fei Xiaotong launched a fierce and vicious attack on the original correct political line and work policy of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; and through the February 1957 work conference of the China Democratic League, which had been controlled by Zhang and Luo, he finally formulated their new line, that is, the line of "uniting the backward, winning over the middle, and attacking the progressive," actively preparing to attack the Party. Under the guidance and influence of this reactionary line, the right-wing elements in the leadership of local China Democratic League organizations and the right-wing elements among league members (that is, the reactionary elements of the Zhang-Luo alliance) invariably took advantage of the slogan of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" to break away from or try to break away from the leadership of the local Party organizations, one-sidedly emphasizing the freedom, independence, and equality of the league organizations, taking it as glory to be on an equal footing with the Party and confront it, and taking it as a shame to accept the leadership of the Party.

Fei Xiaotong himself also specifically implemented this reactionary line in Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi and other places. The content of this line is: first find some people who are ideologically backward, have unstable positions, or have historical problems, have been criticized in the movement, and have always been negative emotions, hold forums, and ask them to complain as much as possible, and then use the snowball method to find more middle and backward elements to hold forums, organize listeners for a few backward people, publicize their anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, so that people who originally had no complaints or not many complaints would be infected, and strive for them to lean to the right. And these materials containing dissatisfaction are listed and synthesized, and re-issued to their designated areas without any criticism, and their "comrades" are called upon to imitate and collect more dissatisfied materials and report them in a timely manner. In this way, more and more materials of dissatisfaction are rolled, and more and more masses of dissatisfaction are rolled, and then run to the central government, holding the materials of dissatisfaction as a basis on the one hand, and grabbing the backward masses as a backing on the other hand, to coerce the Party, saying: Look, the problem is so "serious", the situation is so "dark", you have messed up, step down, let us engage in "Parliament".

After Releasing the Anti-Communist Signal Flare "Early Spring Weather"

By March of this year, Fei Xiaotong believed that their organizational networking work had been done almost enough, so on the one hand, he reported to the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, actually to the Zhang-Luo alliance, saying: "Everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking," asking the China Democratic League to come out to "lead" a group of bourgeois right-wing elements they had organized, and on the other hand, he released the first anti-communist signal flare in the intellectual circles of the country, published the notorious "Intellectuals' Early Spring Weather," implying to the "heroes" and "stalwarts" everywhere that you "are talents," "have skills," "the Communist Party does not understand science and technology," "only knows how to engage in movements," and have always wronged you academically and politically, you should now prepare to "uncover the lid," that is to say, to prepare to "fight." By the end of May, he issued the second signal flare – "Before and After Early Spring," further instigating the "heroes and stalwarts of the world" to say that the Communist Party is a bit hesitant to "uncover" the "lid" of "mutual supervision," "the lid will always be uncovered, it is better to uncover it sooner than later, and better to uncover it big than small," since they are hesitant to uncover it, let everyone "break it open," that is to say, quickly attack the Party. At this time, Fei Xiaotong also "lit the fire" in major cities in the Southeast, vigorously calling on league members and backward masses to rise up to "pour out bitterness" and "complain," and incited the middle and primary school circles to participate in the trouble. He said to middle school teachers at a forum of the China Democratic League in Suzhou: "The reason why the problems of large intellectuals have been solved is because they can shout, and you middle and primary schools must also shout," "I have always advocated developing middle and primary school work in the past two years." And encourage them to write articles and submit them to the Guangming Daily, Wenhui Daily, and New Observer designated by him for publication, and instruct them that this "will have a greater impact." In addition, in the Suzhou and Wuxi areas, he also repeatedly spoke to the United Front Work Department "for not giving the right to vote to lawless landlord class elements"; complained for the counter-revolutionary elements who were struggled in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, "recorded his materials and handed them over to the Expert Bureau in Beijing"; and wrote a letter to Guan Wenwei, Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province, in a "tough tone" to protest the merger of a certain bourgeois element's silkworm farm. This made the reactionary elements praise him as "Bao Gong reborn."

Fei Xiaotong returned to Beijing from Jiangsu on May 31. After getting off the train, he rushed to his student Huang Sha at the "New Observer" to listen to the report on the "speaking out" and "contending" situation of various universities. Hearing about "Lin Xiling's affairs," he "felt that it was good for Lin Xiling to dare to speak, and there was some truth in what she said, and it was democratic for everyone to debate openly." By June 6, he thought that everything had been arranged properly and the time was completely ripe, so he revealed his hideous face at the six professors' forum presided over by Zhang Bojun himself, shouting that the situation was "too dark," the China Democratic League "has a lot to do," and I, Fei Xiaotong, want to come out to "run for election," and firmly stated that "I will not join the Communist Party" and will not eat the Communist Party's food. Then he hurried to the Central United Front Work Department to hand in an "ultimatum." This is the inevitable result of the logical development of their reactionary political line and organizational line, they can only hope to achieve their despicable purpose of establishing the opposition party they dream of and then seizing power through this line.

Attempting to Insert Sinister Hands into the Leadership of Schools and the State

In early June, Fei Xiaotong, also as a planner and supervisor, carried out conspiracy activities on the two major topics of the Zhang-Luo anti-Party group's attack on the Party—"Scientific System" and "School Party Committee System." The Zhang-Luo alliance attempted to use the erroneous thoughts of some scientists to attack the Party in order to seize the leadership of scientific work and guide scientists away from the socialist path. Based on the materials distorting the reality of the scientific community collected by Fei Xiaotong or collected through Fei Xiaotong's networking methods, they drafted "Several Opinions on Issues Related to China's Scientific System," put forward propositions completely opposed to the Party and government's policies, and maliciously shouted the slogan of "protecting scientists," implying that China's scientists were in a state of "being threatened" or "being persecuted." The final revision and finalization of this opinion was handled entirely by Fei Xiaotong, and Fei Xiaotong was not the convener of the so-called "Temporary Scientific Planning Group" (one of the four illegal organizations of the China Democratic League). What is particularly vicious is that Fei Xiaotong attempted to carry out provocation and incitement among young people with the bourgeois hypocritical view of "equality," insisting on writing on the original draft: "In the past, there was a tendency to unilaterally emphasize political conditions in enrollment, promotion, selection of graduate students, and international students," and at the same time, he personally added the words "People should be treated equally in terms of training opportunities within the people." The "equal treatment" number was still revised by another right-wing ambitionist Zeng Zhaolun, and Fei Xiaotong's original writing was more blatant and vicious than this.

Fei Xiaotong is one of the persons in charge of another illegal organization of the China Democratic League, the "School Party Committee System Group." According to his own review: "I think that the 'quality of discussion should be improved' in the rectification... The so-called 'improving the quality of discussion' is to change the direction of rectification and point the finger at the state system." He also said: "When I talked about the situation of the Nationalities Institute at the meeting on June 6, I said that the big-character posters exposed were all issues of cadres' work style, indicating that there was no significant meaning, and more basic issues should be raised, that is, the issue of the system." And said: "The Party cannot only rely on 10 million party members to embody the Party's leadership, but should turn the Party's policies into everyone's understanding and rely on everyone to intervene." Therefore, he dared to deny the provisions of the constitution, saying that "the party committee system in universities has no legal basis," and advocated abolishing the school party committee system and "implementing the president responsible system." On June 4, Fei Xiaotong and Wu Jingchao, Tao Dayong and others held a meeting to discuss the issue of the school party committee system. He greatly praised Wu Jingchao's speech, saying that "Wu Jingchao's speech can be drawn with charts," which means that they have drawn up a very specific and detailed plan, that is, their "suggestions on the leadership system of universities." This plan can be roughly divided into five parts: The first part depicts the Communist Party members in the school as "dictatorial" and "ignorant of science and technology" people, and maliciously slanders the Party. The second part stipulates the scope of the Party's activities in universities, arrogantly interfering in the Party's internal affairs. The third, fourth, and fifth parts stipulate the establishment of various "committees" in the school, attempting to use the activities of these "committees" to disintegrate the Party's leadership into pieces and turn it into nothing. Fei Xiaotong believes that this is a good way to "urge party members to combine with the masses." And said: "Not only should it be like this in schools, but generally speaking, the burden of the country should also be carried by everyone." Under the angry questioning of the masses, Fei Xiaotong has now initially confessed that his remarks "are also the remarks of Chu Anping's 'Party World,' so-called 'let everyone carry the burden of the country,' which is also to intervene in leadership, which is also to usurp leadership."

"Stealing and Robbing" "Academic Skills"

Fei Xiaotong was originally a political ambitionist who was ignorant and specialized in exploiting loopholes. Before liberation, he wrote some articles in the style of essays on Chinese social issues to find a way out for the landlord class. Even in the eyes of bourgeois sociologists, these were just pieced-together "novels" with no "academic value" whatsoever. After liberation, he read even less, studied even less, and did not even read newspapers, regarded Marxism-Leninism as dogma, and did not take it seriously at all. Therefore, after eating his fill, he did not do serious things, and specialized in finding backward elements to complain, saying nothing of substance. In the criticism of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary incident, he also wrote articles expressing dissatisfaction and resentment after liberation, supporting Hu Feng (at that time, the article was pointed out by others as reactionary, so it was burned). However, he regards himself as a representative of intellectuals, specializes in political activities, and is a figure who obtains and preserves his status by this, so he is naturally unwilling to lose the guise of "scholar."

In order to engage in some so-called academic works to raise his own worth, Fei Xiaotong stooped to stealing the labor results of others. Since liberation, he has published five or six academic papers, all of which were slightly revised from stolen drafts. For example, the article "A Brief Overview of Kawoh Society" was compiled from four types of manuscripts and two types of unpublished materials. These manuscripts were sent to the Central Institute for Nationalities by young scholars for expert guidance, but were taken as their own by this "expert." For example, the article "Several Tasks Proposed to Ethnology by the Current National Work," from drafting, revising, discussing to finalizing, was a collective creation of the relevant personnel of the Research Department of the Nationalities Institute. Fei Xiaotong did not spend any labor at all, but in the end, he arbitrarily modified it a few times and published it in his own name. For example, the article "Carry out Archaeological Work in Ethnic Minority Areas and Areas Related to the History of Ethnic Minorities" (published in "Archaeological Communication" No. 3, 1956) was dictated by Professor Wang Jingru, recorded by Lecturer Song Shuhua, and then other people provided opinions, and finally Fei Xiaotong put it together. This year, the "Preliminary Inspection and Visit of Historical Relics in Dali, Yunnan" published in the third issue of "Archaeological Communication" was also a rewrite of Mr. Li Jiarui's manuscript on historical relics in Dali. Even the "Early Spring Weather" was helped by Bing Xin. He has always pretended to know what he doesn't know, sell air, and bluff and deceive people in academic issues and even in common sense. For example, there is no "Twenty-Four Histories" in his home at all, and he has never read "Twenty-Four Histories," but in his notorious "Early Spring Weather," he said that "I myself have moved the Twenty-Four Histories to the bookshelf, and I recently bought a 'Zizhi Tongjian'" to brag and show off.

Plotting to Restore Bourgeois Sociology

But Fei Xiaotong has great ambitions in academics. He wants to restore bourgeois sociology, first occupy a position in the academic world, and then further eliminate Marxism-Leninism in academic thought. On the eve of the rectification campaign, the old team in the sociological circle had met in Beijing under the networking of Fei Xiaotong, Pan Guangdan, Wu Jingchao, Wu Wenzao and others, and held a meeting. On June 9, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Wu Wenzao and others held another meeting on restoring "sociology," and decided to restore the sociology departments in universities in four places: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, starting with Beijing and Shanghai. In Beijing, a department was established at Peking University, with Wu Wenzao as the director, and a sociology research office was established at Renmin University, presided over by Wu Jingchao. In addition, it was decided to establish a sociological society in Beijing and Shanghai, and first register sociology personnel. They have thus demarcated the territory and arranged the positions, and are waiting for the anti-socialist scientific program that has been tampered with to be "announced" before they appear on stage. Fei Xiaotong himself is also a commander in this battlefield. He wants to closely combine reactionary bourgeois sociology and reactionary bourgeois political activities to serve his sinister and despicable purposes.

In order to expand his influence in politics and academics, Fei Xiaotong spared no effort to seize strongholds in the press and publishing circles. "New Observer," a mass publication, has long become a tool for Fei Xiaotong to arbitrarily spread poison and release poisonous arrows. "Wenhui Daily" and "Guangming Daily" are also one of Fei Xiaotong's anti-socialist positions.

A Political Broker Who Has Always Colluded with the US and Chiang Kai-shek

Fei Xiaotong's anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracy activities are not accidental. According to comrades, Fei Xiaotong's life history is a typical history of an extremely selfish and self-interested bourgeois individualist. For his own personal interests and purposes, he does not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of everyone. Fei Xiaotong said in "Rural China": "In order to oneself, one can sacrifice the family, in order to the family, one can sacrifice the party, in order to the party, one can sacrifice the country, in order to the country, one can sacrifice the world." This is his unwavering outlook on life and worldview.

Before liberation, Fei Xiaotong consistently cultivated reactionary bureaucrats, politicians, academic bullies, and imperialist diplomats, cultural spies, and academic swindlers, and used their power to climb up. In 1930, when Fei was studying at Yenching University, he colluded with Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun. In 1933, when he went to the Graduate School of Tsinghua University, he met Pan Guangdan, Wu Jingchao and others. After graduating from Tsinghua University, he obtained a sum of money from Li Zongren through Zhang Junmai to conduct rural surveys, collect rural materials with a reactionary sociological perspective, write books, and use Xu Guanglang to translate them into English and take them to the British London School of Economics to study, and was praised by the imperialist scholar Functionalist head Malinowski, and won the false name of "Chinese young sociologist." During this period, he accepted a smattering of the absurd theories of the Fabian Society, and after returning to China, he sang the middle line and opposed the people's revolution. After 1941, in order to rely on Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism, and win their favor in order to carry out activities to sell out the country in the United States, Fei Xiaotong joined the Kuomintang before going to the United States, and was trained in the Kuomintang Central Training Group and learned reactionary skills.

In the United States, Fei Xiaotong had close contacts with Mr. and Mrs. Fairbank of Harvard University (American spies). After he returned from the United States, he proposed to smelt the political democracy of the United Kingdom and the United States and the economic democracy of the Soviet Union, concealing the reactionary essence of British and American imperialism and slandering the Soviet Union for not having political democracy. At the same time, he also borrowed some Anglo-American imperialist elements to respect himself. During the "December 1st" movement, Fei Xiaotong was in Kunming. On the surface, he pretended to be "progressive," but in his bones he opposed class struggle, opposed the people's revolution, and opposed progressive professors teaching courses in the Sociology Department of Yunnan University, which he presided over. And he maintained close contact with the US consulate at any time. When the struggle was acute, he hid in the US consulate with Pan Guangdan and others, and did not dare to show his face. Someone went to ask him to sign the declaration protesting Chiang Kai-shek's persecution of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, and after arguing for a day, he finally refused. Then he used the relationship of the Kuomintang to grab a special plane chartered by the Kuomintang to fly away from Kunming; and openly declared to the Kuomintang: "We (Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong) are going to Suzhou to study," meaning that we do not oppose you. Then (1946) through the relationship of Wu Wenzao, a high official of the Kuomintang at that time, he went to the UK again to carry out activities. After returning to China, he tried his best to praise the British Labor Party politics, and sang a series of revisionist theories, attempting to oppose the people's liberation movement led by the Communist Party at that time. By 1947, the domestic political situation took a sharp turn for the worse, and the victorious foundation of the people's revolution had been laid. After the middle line was bankrupt, he became more politically shaky, accepted the wooing of the reactionaries, went to the Northeast to "lecture" at the invitation of Wei Lihuang, and published reactionary articles in the "New Road" magazine to poison young people. Until liberation, his middle-of-the-road thinking has not changed at all, but has been hidden in his heart, temporarily not "released." When he believes that the "weather" is favorable to him, for example, during this rectification campaign, he came out to rant and compete with the people for the world.

    费孝通反动活动的面面观
    中央民族学院  刘荣焌  余胜椿
    早已和章罗搭档图谋复辟
    解放初期，费孝通写了一篇文章“我这一年”，“表面上承认我国的民主，但在感情上并没有改变过来”，“心里对资产阶级民主是留恋的”。由于当时国内外阶级斗争形势还很紧张，他的反抗企图只好“封闭”在“心里”，但一有机会可乘，便立即起来反抗。例如他曾经有过这样的“豪语”：“我先肯定人民代表大会，然后来‘改造’它”。他想把人民代表大会“改造”成一个“巴力门”。（即资产阶级议会）。又如1951年，政府将要实施院系调整工作，他便和美国特务张东荪和潘光旦、吴景超等右派分子密谋反对，使院系调整工作推迟了一年。
    1953年总路线公布后，章伯钧到处鼓吹：“今后社会上只剩下工人、农民和知识分子，民主党派必须成为知识分子的政党”。素与章伯钧在盟内争权夺利的罗隆基立即附和章的主张，费孝通也从这时起和罗隆基更进一步的勾结起来。因为章、罗的方向正是费孝通的方向，章、罗的手法也正是费孝通的先“肯定它”然后“改造它”（通过把民主党派“改造”成为资产阶级右派知识分子政党，然后“改造”社会主义为资本主义）的手法。费孝通在1955年10月间向民盟中央建议采用串连方法，了解知识分子问题。他根据在北京进行的五、六次串连的情况，写成了两篇综合汇报，歪曲地反映了党与非党关系、肃反的后果等等。他把自己的腐臭的思想和意图偷偷地渗入其中，构成一幅黯淡的图画，用个别好像是很客观实际的“例子”来挑拨党和知识分子的关系。
    1956年上半年，社会主义国家在民主生活方面采取了一系列的重大措施，费孝通认为可以“开放反共反社会主义的言行了”，于是“过去压制在心里的资产阶级思想和情绪进一步冒了出来”，积极进行反共反社会主义的阴谋活动。
    章罗联盟的反动政治路线是费孝通搞的
    1956年8月，费孝通以国务院专家局副局长、民盟中央文教部部长的身份到西南去搞“知识分子工作”和“视察盟务”。他这次西南之行，为章罗联盟做了两件大事：第一，从视察中发现了民盟这个组织“有作用”、“有力量”、“有人才”，可以为知识分子“仗义执言”，对党实行“监督”。也就是说，真正可以着手组织一个知识分子的政党了；第二，他从串连活动中，进一步摸到了一套为章罗联盟在知识分子中扩大影响和势力所需要的更完善的组织路线、行动纲领和工作方针。西南归来以后，费孝通向民盟中央原有正确的政治路线和工作方针，展开了猛烈的恶毒的进攻；并通过已被章、罗所把持的民盟1957年2月工作会议，终于制成了他们的新的路线，即“团结落后，争取中间，打击进步”的积极准备向党进攻的路线。在这条反动路线指导和影响之下，各地民盟组织领导层中的右派分子和盟员中的右派分子
  （即章罗联盟的反动分子）毫无例外地利用了“长期共存，互相监督”的口号，脱离或力图脱离当地党组织的领导，片面强调盟组织的自由、独立与平等，以与党平起平坐，分庭抗礼为光荣，接受党的领导为耻辱。
    费孝通本人还在南京、苏州、无锡等地具体执行这条反动路线。这条路线的内容是：先找些思想落后，立场不稳，或者历史有问题，在运动中受过批评，情绪一贯消极的人，举行座谈会，叫他们尽量发牢骚，然后用滚雪球的方式找更多的中间分子和落后分子举行座谈，给少数落后的人组织听众，替他们反党反社会主义的言论做宣传，使原来没有牢骚或牢骚不多的人发生感染作用，争取他们向右靠拢。并把这些含有不满情绪的材料，加以罗列综合，丝毫不加批判地重新发到他们指定的地区，叫他们的“同志们”如法泡制，搜集更多的不满材料，及时上报。这样，不满的材料愈滚愈多，不满的群众愈滚愈众，然后跑到中央来，一手拿着不满的材料作根据，一手抓住落后群众作后盾，向党要挟说：看，问题这样“严重”，情况这样“黑暗”，你们搞糟了，下台吧，让我们来搞“巴力门”。
    放出反共的信号弹“早春天气”之后
    到今年3月，费孝通认为他们的组织串连工作已经做得差不多了，于是一面给民盟中央，实际是给章、罗联盟上报告说：“万事俱备，只欠东风”，要民盟出来“领导”他们所组织起来的一批资产阶级右派分子，一面在全国知识界放出了第一颗反共的信号弹，发表了那篇臭名远扬的
  “知识分子的早春天气”，暗示各路“英雄”，八方“豪杰”说：你们“是人才”，“有本领”，
  “共产党不懂科学技术”，“只知道搞运动”，在学术上、政治上，一向委曲了你们，你们现在应当准备起来“揭盖子”了，也即是说要他们准备起来“战斗”了。到了5月下旬，又发出了第二颗信号弹——“早春前后”，进一步教唆“天下英雄豪杰们”说：共产党对于“互相监督”的“盖子”，有点欲揭还罢的“神气”，“盖子总是要揭的，迟揭不如早揭，小揭不如大揭”，他们既然迟迟不揭，大家就把它“冲开”吧，也就是说，赶快向党进攻。这时候，费孝通并在东南各大城市
  “点火”，大力号召盟员和落后群众起来“吐苦水”“发牢骚”，并煽动中小学界一致起来参加闹事。他在苏州民盟的座谈会上对中学教师这样说：“大知识分子的问题所以得到解决，是因为他们会叫，你们中小学也要叫”，“我这两年一直是主张要开展中小学工作的”。并鼓励他们写文章交给他指定的光明日报、文汇报、新观察发表，还指示他们说，这样“影响就会大一些”。此外，在苏州、无锡一带，他还一再为“没有给不法地主阶级分子选举权”，而向统战部说话；为在肃反中被斗的反革命分子抱不平，“把他的材料记下，回北京交给专家局”；为某资产阶级分子的蚕种场合并问题，以“强硬的口气”给江苏省管文蔚副省长写信，表示抗议。这使得反动分子称誉他为“包公再世”。
    费孝通于5月31日由江苏回到北京，下车之后，就匆匆跑到“新观察”社他的学生黄沙那里去听取各大学“鸣”“放”情况的汇报。听到了
  “林希翎的事”，他“觉得林希翎敢于说话是好的，所说的话中间也有一些道理，大家公开辩论，那是民主”。到了6月6日，他以为一切布置妥当了，时机也完全成熟了，便在章伯钧亲自主持的六教授座谈会上露出狰狞的面目，大叫情况“太黑暗了”，民盟“大有可为”，我费孝通要出来“竞选”，并坚决表明“不参加共产党”，不吃共产党的饭。接着就匆匆忙忙地跑到中央统战部递“哀的美敦书”。这是他们的反动政治路线和组织路线的逻辑发展的必然结果，他们只有希望通过这条路线，才能成立他们所梦想的反对党、进而夺取政权的卑鄙目的。
    企图把罪恶之手插入学校和国家的领导中
    6月上旬，费孝通在章、罗反党集团向党进攻的两个大题目——“科学体制”和“学校党委制”——上，也以策划者和督战者的姿态，进行了阴谋活动。章、罗联盟企图利用一部分科学家的错误思想，对党进攻，以便夺取科学工作的领导权，引导科学家离开社会主义的道路。他们根据费孝通搜集的或通过费孝通的串连方法所搜集的歪曲科学界现实的材料，草拟了“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”，提出了同党和政府的方针完全对立的主张，并恶意地叫出“保护科学家”的口号，暗示我国科学家已处于“受威胁”或者“受迫害”的地位。这份意见书的最后修正、定稿，是由费孝通一手包办的，而费孝通并不是所谓“科学规划临时小组”（民盟四大非法组织之一）的召集人。特别恶毒的是费孝通企图以资产阶级虚伪的“平等”观，在青年中进行挑拨和煽动，坚持要在原稿上写出：“过去在升学、升级、选拔研究生、留学生时，有片面强调政治条件的偏向”，同时，亲手加上了“人民内部在培养机会上应一视同仁”的字样。其中“一视同仁”数字还是另一右派野心家曾昭抡修改过来的，费孝通原来的写法比这更加露骨而恶毒。
    费孝通是民盟另一非法组织“学校党委制小组”的负责人之一。据他自己检查说：“我认为在整风中应当‘提高讨论的质量’……所谓‘讨论要提高质量’，就是想改变整风的方针，矛头指向国家的制度。”又说：“我在6月6日的会上谈到民族学院的情况时曾说，大字报揭露的都是些干部的作风问题，表示没有重大意义，应当提出比较基本的问题，那就是制度的问题”。并说：“党不能只靠一千万党员来体现党的领导，而应当把党的政策变成大家的认识，靠大家来插手”。因此，他竟敢于否认宪法的规定，说“高等学校党委制没有法律根据”，而主张取消学校党委制，“实行校务委员会负责制”。6月4日，费孝通和吴景超、陶大镛等开会讨论学校党委制问题，他对吴景超的发言大加赞赏，说“吴景超的发言可以用图表画出来”，这就是说，他们已经拟订了一套非常具体细密的方案，即他们“对于高等学校领导制度的建议”。这套方案大略可分为五部分：第一部分，把学校的共产党员描绘成“独断专行”，不懂科学技术的人物，对党进行了恶毒的诽谤。第二部分，规定党在高等学校的活动范围，狂妄地干涉党的内政。第三、第四、第五部分，规定在学校设置各种“委员会”，企图通过这些“委员会”的活动，使党的领导化整为零，变为乌有。费孝通认为这是“督促党员非与群众结合不可的”好办法。并且说：“不但是在学校应如此，总的说，国家这担子也要让大家来挑”。在群众愤怒质问之下，费孝通现在已初步供出他的这些论调，“也就是储安平‘党天下’的论调，所谓‘让大家来挑国家这个担子’，也就是要插手领导，也就是要篡夺领导权。”
          “连偷带抢”的“学术本领”
    费孝通原是个不学无术、专门钻空子的政治野心家。解放前，他以杂文风格写了一些为地主阶级寻觅出路的有关中国社会问题的文章，即使在资产阶级社会学者看来，这也是些杂拼的“小说”，丝毫没有“学术价值”。解放后，他更加不读书，不学习，甚至连报纸也不看，把马列主义视为教条，根本不看在眼上。因而，吃饱了饭，不做正经事，专门找落后分子发牢骚，言不及义。在批判胡风反革命事件中，他还写有解放后由不满而发牢骚而有抗拒情绪的文章，为胡风撑腰（当时该文被旁人指出是反动的，因而烧去）。然而，他是以知识分子的代表者自居，专干政治活动，并以此得到地位和保全地位的人物，自然不甘心丢掉“学者”的幌子。
    为了搞点所谓学术性的著作，借以抬高自己的身价，费孝通下流到窃占他人的劳动成果。解放以来，他发表了五、六篇学术论文，都是盗窃旁人的成稿略加编改而成的。例如“佧佤社会概况”一文，取用稿本四种、未公开的资料两种编写的。这些稿件是青年学者们为请专家指导而寄给中央民族学院的，却被这位“专家”据为己有。又如“当前民族工作提给民族学的几个任务”一文，从起草、修正、讨论到定稿，都是民院研究部有关人员的集体创作，费孝通没有花费过任何劳力，但最后却由他随意修改几下，用他本人的名义发表。又如“开展少数民族地区和与少数民族历史有关地区的考古工作”（载“考古通讯”1956年第三期）一文，是由王静如教授口述，宋蜀华讲师记录，再经其他数人提供意见，最后由费连缀成篇的。今年在“考古通讯”第三期发表“云南大理历史文物的初步察访”，也是偷窃李家瑞先生的关于大理历史文物稿件改写的。甚至连“早春天气”也是由冰心帮助写成的。他在学术问题甚至在普通常识上一贯是强不知以为知，买空卖空，招摇撞骗的。例如，他家里根本没有“廿四史”，也从来没有读过“廿四史”，但他却在那篇臭名远扬的“早春天气”里说什么“连我自己都把廿四史搬上了书架，最近还买了一部‘资治通鉴’”来大吹大擂，炫耀自己。
    图谋恢复资产阶级社会学
    但费孝通在学术上却抱有很大的野心。他想恢复资产阶级的社会学，首先在学术界占领一个阵地，然后进一步消灭学术思想上的马克思列宁主义。整风前夕，社会学界那班旧人马已在费孝通、潘光旦、吴景超、吴文藻等人四出串连之下，在北京碰了头，开了会。6月9日，费孝通、吴景超、吴文藻等人又开了一次关于恢复“社会学”的会议，决定在北京、上海、广州、成都四个地方的大学恢复社会学系，先从北京、上海两地做起。北京方面，在北京大学设系，由吴文藻担任系主任，另在人民大学设社会学研究室，由吴景超主持。此外，决定在北京、上海两地设立社会学会，先进行社会学人员的登记。他们就这样划定了地盘，安排了位置，只等被篡改的反社会主义的科学纲领“公布”以后，便要袍笏登场。费孝通本人在这个战场上也是一个主帅，他想使反动的资产阶级社会学和反动的资产阶级政治活动密切结合起来，为他的阴险卑鄙的目的服务。
    为了在政治上、学术上扩大影响，费孝通不遗余力地在新闻界、出版界攫取据点。“新观察”这个群众性的刊物，长期以来成为费孝通任意散布毒素、放射毒箭的工具，“文汇报”和“光明日报”也是费孝通反社会主义的阵地之一。
    一贯勾结美蒋的政治掮客
    费孝通进行反共反社会主义的阴谋活动，并不是偶然的，据有关同志揭发，费孝通一生的历史，是一个典型的极端自私自利的资产阶级个人主义者的历史，他为了自己个人的利益和目的，不惜牺牲一切人的利益。费孝通在“乡土中国”中说：“为了自己可以牺牲家，为了家可以牺牲党，为了党可以牺牲国，为了国可以牺牲天下”，这就是他坚信不移的人生观和世界观。
    解放前，费孝通一贯结纳反动官僚、政客、学阀和帝国主义外交人员、文化特务、学术骗子，借他们的力量往上爬。1930年，费在燕京大学读书时，即与张君劢、张东荪相勾结。1933年，他到清华大学研究院读书时，又和潘光旦、吴景超等人结识。清华大学毕业后，他通过张君劢在李宗仁那里得到一笔钱，进行农村调查，以反动的社会学观点，搜集农村资料，写成著作，并利用徐光烺译成英文，带往英国，进英国伦敦经济学院读书，得到帝国主义学者功能学派头子马凌诺斯基的夸奖，博得“中国青年社会学家”的虚名。在此期间，他接受了一鳞半爪的费边社的荒谬理论，回国以后，大唱中间路线，反对人民革命。1941年后，费孝通为了投靠蒋介石和美帝国主义，博得他们的欢心，以便在美国进行出卖祖国的活动，他就在去美国之前，参加了国民党，并在国民党中央训练团受训，学习了反动的本事。
    在美国，费孝通和哈佛大学的费正清夫妇（美国特务）来往很密。他从美国回来后，提出要冶英美的政治民主与苏联的经济民主为一炉，蒙蔽英美帝国主义的反动实质，诬蔑苏联没有政治民主。同时，他还借勾结一些英美帝国主义分子以自重。“一二·一”运动时，费孝通在昆明，表面上装作“进步”的样子，骨子里是反对阶级斗争，反对人民革命，反对进步教授到他所主持的云南大学社会学系开课。他并且随时和美国领事馆保持着密切的联系，到斗争尖锐时，即和潘光旦等人躲进了美国领事馆里，不敢出头露面了。有人去请他在抗议蒋介石迫害李公朴、闻一多的宣言上签名，吵了一天，他终于拒绝。接着他就利用国民党的关系，抢搭国民党特派的专机飞离昆明；并公开向国民党表明：“我们（潘光旦、费孝通）要到苏州去做学问了”，意思是说我们不反对你们了。旋又（1946年）通过当时国民党大官吴文藻的关系，再度去英国活动，回国后，极力颂扬英国的工党政治，唱出了一连串修正主义的理论，企图反对当时共产党所领导的人民解放运动。到了1947年，国内政治局势急转直下，人民革命的胜利基础业已奠定，中间路线遭到破产以后，他在政治上更加摇摆，接受反动派的拉拢，应卫立煌之请去东北“讲学”，并在“新路”杂志上发表反动文章，毒害青年。直到解放，他的中间路线思想根本没有改变，只是潜伏心底，暂时不“放”，一到他认为“天气”对他有利的时机，例如，在这次整风期间，便出来大放厥词，要和人民争夺天下了。
