Xinhua News Agency, August 8th, London Dispatch: On the twelfth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by the United States, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Gollan, called on the British labor movement and all peace groups, as well as every individual, to take action to force the government to immediately change its attitude of opposing the cessation of hydrogen bomb tests.

Gollan pointed out in the "Daily Worker" in London on August 6th that British Prime Minister Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Lloyd are the culprits obstructing the UN Disarmament Subcommittee from reaching an agreement on banning tests. He said that if they had agreed with Soviet representative Zorin to end hydrogen bomb tests, the United States would have been forced to agree. But the Conservative government refused to do so because it was reorganizing the British armed forces to fully equip them with nuclear weapons.

Gollan pointed out that the British Labour Party, every trade union, every Christian church, the cooperative movement, every part of the peace movement, the United Nations Association, and most British scientists are demanding a cessation of tests.

Gollan finally called on the Labour Party Executive Committee to immediately launch a nationwide movement to urge the Trades Union Congress and the cooperative movement to force the government to change its attitude and agree to cancel the tests before the UN General Assembly convenes. He asked the leaders of the Christian churches to use the moral strength they possess to force the government to take action. He also asked workshop representatives, secretaries of Labour Party organizations and trade union organizations at all levels, and activists in the peace movement and women's organizations to once again send telegrams, pass resolutions, petition, hold rallies, and file protests. He said that the people's actions can be decisive, and it must be decisive, let us make it decisive.

    纪念广岛遭原子弹轰炸十二周年
    高兰号召英国人民迫使政府停止核试验
    指责英国当局是阻挠达成禁止核试验协议的罪人
    据新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：英国共产党总书记高兰在广岛遭到美国原子弹轰炸十二周年的时候号召英国劳工运动和所有和平团体以及每一个人都行动起来，迫使政府立即改变反对停止氢弹试验的态度。
    高兰8月6日在伦敦“工人日报”上指出，英国首相麦克米伦和外交大臣劳埃德是阻挠联合国裁军小组委员会就禁止试验达成协议的罪人。他说，如果他们同苏联代表佐林一起同意结束氢弹试验的话，美国本来是会被迫同意的。但是保守党政府却因为自己正在改组英国武装部队使他们完全装备核武器而拒绝这样作。
    高兰指出，英国工党、每一工会、每一个基督教会、合作运动、和平运动的每个部分、联合国协会以及大多数英国科学家都要求停止试验。
    高兰最后呼吁工党执行委员会马上发动一次全国性的运动，促使职工大会和合作运动迫使政府改变它的态度，在联大召开以前就同意取消试验。他要求基督教会的领袖们利用他们拥有的道义力量来迫使政府行动起来。他还要求车间代表、各级工党和各级工会组织的书记们、和平运动和妇女组织的积极分子们再一次打电报、通过决议、请愿、举行集会和提出抗议。他说，人民的行动能够具有决定性，它必须具有决定性，让我们使它具有决定性罢。
