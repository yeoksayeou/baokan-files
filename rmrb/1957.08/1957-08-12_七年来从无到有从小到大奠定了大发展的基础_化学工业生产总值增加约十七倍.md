Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch (By Xinhua News Agency reporter Shu Ti): Over the past seven years, China's chemical industry has laid the foundation for great development from scratch and from small to large. The dye, pesticide, and pharmaceutical industrial sectors within the chemical industry have developed from an extremely weak base into basically independent production departments.

In the past seven years, China's chemical industry has developed rapidly at an average annual growth rate of 30%. The planned total output value of the chemical industry in 1957 increased by approximately seventeen times compared to 1949. The output of many chemical products of extreme importance to the development of the national economy, such as soda ash, acids, automobile tires, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, sulfa drugs, etc., increased by more than five to thirty times when comparing the 1957 production level with 1949. The variety of chemical products also increased from eighty or ninety types (categories) in the early days of liberation to more than nine hundred types (categories) today. Indanthrene dyes, ice dyes, aureomycin, penicillin, BHC, DDT, phosphate fertilizers, aircraft tires, tractor tires, and organic glass and special paints for the aviation industry, etc., which had never been produced in China's chemical history, have all started production for the first time in our country. Among them, the fermentation units and product quality of antibiotics such as aureomycin, as well as the quality of indanthrene and BHC, have approached the advanced levels of the world.

China's chemical industry currently includes departments such as acid and alkali, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, organic synthesis, plastics, dyes, paints, rubber processing, pharmaceuticals, and reagents.

As early as 1,600 years ago, the seeds of China's chemical industry had sprouted at the foot of Gouqu Mountain in Jiangsu Province. Some principles of modern chemistry, such as "metal displacement," were already recognized by the Chinese people between the Qin and Han dynasties and were used in production practice by the Tang and Five Dynasties. However, until the time of liberation, the foundation of China's chemical industry was weaker than any other industrial sector such as metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, and textiles. Before liberation, there were only a few small processing chemical plants in coastal cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin that relied on imperialism. There were no more than ten chemical plants of considerable scale in the whole country. Therefore, in old China, almost all chemical raw materials and most chemical products relied on imports from imperialist countries. After liberation, China's chemical industry has greatly developed. During the First Five-Year Plan period alone, there were fifteen newly built and renovated enterprises above the quota, such as alkali plants, chemical fertilizer plants, rubber plants, plastic plants, and dye plants. In the past seven years, China has been able to produce the four most important types of antibiotics, the most advanced products in the world's pharmaceutical industry: penicillin, streptomycin, aureomycin, and chloramphenicol. These four antibiotics account for more than 90% of the need for antibiotics during medical treatment. In the dye industry, in the past, China could only produce vulcanized blue among sulfur dyes. Now, direct dyes, basic dyes, ice dyes, indanthrene, and intermediates for manufacturing dyes can all be produced in large quantities. At present, the dyes required by China's paper making, leather, plastics, cotton, wool, silk printing and dyeing industries, etc., can supply about 80% from the total amount, and also can supply more than half from the variety. Because China's chemical industry can produce a large number of special drugs such as antimony potassium tartrate and hetrazan for the treatment of schistosomiasis, filariasis and other diseases, it has powerfully supported China's medical institutions in eliminating schistosomiasis, filariasis, smallpox, malaria and other diseases. The production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides such as BHC and dinitrocresol has made a significant contribution to the development of agriculture. The BHC planned to be produced this year alone can kill locusts or wheat sucking bugs in 800 million mu of fields at one time. China's chemical industry has been able to produce a complete set of rubber parts required for automobile manufacturing, which provides conditions for the development of China's automobile industry.

In old China, not a single chemical plant was designed by China itself. At that time, there were very few domestic chemical design personnel and researchers. With the liberation of the whole country, in just seven short years, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have trained tens of thousands of design and research talents in various aspects of the chemical industry. The chemical fertilizer, organic synthesis, basic chemical, pharmaceutical, rubber and other research and design institutions under the Ministry of Chemical Industry alone have more than 3,000 research and design personnel. Now, China can independently design some large-scale modern fertilizer plants, alkali plants, rubber plants, pharmaceutical plants, dye plants, etc. Many chemical plants that will be newly built and renovated during the Second Five-Year Plan period have been successively designed by China's chemical experts. According to experts, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, China's chemical industry, from design to production, from raw materials to finished products, will basically be able to achieve self-reliance and self-sufficiency except for a few varieties. Chemical products such as alkali, medicines, pesticides, and dyes can also strive for partial export. It is estimated that the output value of chemical products exported next year will increase by about 40% compared to this year.

    七年来从无到有从小到大奠定了大发展的基础
    化学工业生产总值增加约十七倍
    新华社11日讯　新华社记者舒倜报道：我国的化学工业，七年来已经从无到有、从小到大地奠定了大发展的基础。化学工业中的染料、农药、医药等工业部门，已经在极其薄弱的基础上发展成为能够基本独立的生产部门。
    在过去的七年中，我国化学工业以每年平均增长30％的速度迅速地发展起来。1957年化学工业的计划生产总值比1949年增加约十七倍以上。对发展国民经济有极其重要意义的许多化工产品，如纯碱、酸类、汽车轮胎、化学肥料、农药、磺胺药品等的产量，以1957年的生产水平同1949年相比较，增长了五倍到三十倍以上，化工产品的品种也由解放初期的八、九十种（类）增加到现在的九百多种（类）。我国化工史上从来没有生产过的染料中的阴丹士林、冰染染料，医药中的金霉素、青霉素，农药中的六六六、滴滴涕，化学肥料中的磷肥，轮胎中的飞机轮胎、拖拉机轮胎，以及航空工业用的有机玻璃、特种油漆等等，都先后第一次在我国开始了生产。其中，金霉素等抗生素的发酵单位、产品质量，以及阴丹士林、六六六等的质量，都已经接近了世界的先进水平。
    我国的化学工业，目前包括有酸碱、化学肥料、农药、有机合成、塑料、染料、油漆、橡胶加工、医药、试剂等部门。
    远在一千六百年以前，在江苏省的勾曲山下，我国就已经有了化学事业的萌芽。近代化学上所说的一些原理，如“金属换置作用”，我国人民早在秦汉之间就已有认识，到唐和五代，已经用于生产实践。可是，直到解放的时候为止，我国化学工业的基础，比冶金、机械制造、纺织等任何一种工业部门都要薄弱。解放以前，我国只在上海、天津等沿海城市中有一些依赖于帝国主义的小型的加工性质的化工厂，较具规模的化学工厂，在全国不上十个。因此，在旧中国，几乎全部化工原料，大部分化工产品，都仰赖于从帝国主义国家进口。解放以后，我国的化学工业有了很大发展。在第一个五年计划期间，仅限额以上的新建和改建企业，就有碱厂、化学肥料厂、橡胶厂、塑料厂、染料厂等十五个。在过去的七年中，世界医药工业中最先进的产品——抗生素，我国已经能够生产其中最主要的四种：青霉素、链霉素、金霉素和合霉素。这四种抗生素，占医疗时对抗生素需要的90％以上。在染料工业中，过去我国只能生产硫化染料中的硫化青，现在直接色染料、盐基染料、冰染染料、阴丹士林和制造染料的中间体等都能大量生产了。现在，我国造纸、皮革、塑料、棉毛丝印染等工业部门所需的染料，从总量上说，已经能够供应80％左右，从品种上说，也能供应一半以上。由于我国化学工业能够大量生产治疗血吸虫病、血丝虫病等疾病的酒石酸锑钾、海群生等等特效药，这就有力地支援了我国医疗机构来灭消血吸虫病、血丝虫病、天花、疟疾等病害。化学肥料和六六六、毒杀酚等农药的生产，对发展农业作出了重大的贡献。仅今年计划生产的六六六，就可以一次杀死八亿亩田里的蝗虫或小麦吸浆虫。我国化学工业已经能够生产制造汽车所需的全套橡胶配件，这给我国汽车工业的发展提供了条件。
    在旧中国，没有一个化学工厂是我国自己设计的。当时，国内化工方面的设计人员、研究人员，寥寥无几。随着全国的解放，在短短的七年中，中国共产党和人民政府就培养出成千上万的化学工业各个方面的设计人材和研究人材。仅化学工业部所属的化学肥料、有机合成、基本化学、医药、橡胶等研究和设计机构内就拥有研究和设计力量三千多人。现在，一些规模巨大的近代化的肥料厂、碱厂、橡胶厂、医药厂、染料厂等等，我国都能够独立地进行设计了。即将在第二个五年计划期间新建和改建的许多化工厂，已经由我国的化工专家们先后开始设计。据专家们说，在第二个五年计划期间，我国的化学工业从设计到生产，从原料到成品，除个别品种以外，都将能基本上做到自力更生，自给自足。碱、药品、农药、染料等化工产品，还能争取部分出口。预计明年出口的化工产品的产值，将比今年增加40％左右。
