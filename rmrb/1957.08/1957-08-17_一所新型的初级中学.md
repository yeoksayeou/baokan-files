    A New Type of Junior High School
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    In Machang Village, Wangqu Township, Chang'an County, there is a junior high school run collectively by the masses. This school was built in September last year. The entire school has sixty-two students and two teachers.
    Of course, there are many difficulties in running a middle school, such as the need to solve problems like school buildings, teachers, and board and lodging for students who live far away. However, these difficulties did not scare the people running the school. The school board, in the spirit of running the school diligently and thriftily, relied closely on the cadres and masses of the nearby agricultural cooperatives, and these problems were solved smoothly. For example, the classrooms were solved with the help of Machang Primary School, which converted two third-grade classes into a two-shift system, freeing up a classroom for the middle school to use; the student dormitories were solved with the help of the agricultural cooperative, which dispersed the farm implements to various production teams for safekeeping, freeing up warehouses for students to use as dormitories; with the help of the agricultural cooperative, an old cooperative member who knew how to cook was hired to solve the problem of meals for boarding students.
    The most difficult problem was teaching. The school has two teachers, one is the head teacher Zhang Zhenrong, and the other is teacher Gao Yongmao. Both of these teachers were selected from primary school teachers. Although they have rich teaching experience, they still have many difficulties in undertaking junior high school teaching tasks. This is not only because the junior high school curriculum is more difficult than the primary school curriculum, but also because there are many types of junior high school courses, and the two teachers cannot take care of them all. How to overcome this difficulty? In the early days of the school year, the principals of Huangfu, Wangqu and other primary schools temporarily helped with teaching; later, the problem was solved by adopting a method of mutual assistance in teaching. Head teacher Zhang Zhenrong was responsible for teaching history to the fifth grade of Machang Primary School, and teacher Gao Yongmao taught nature and arithmetic to the fifth and sixth grades of the primary school. Teachers Liu Yongqin, Ma Dequan and Guo Junzhe from Machang Primary School were responsible for hygiene, art, music and physical education classes in the junior high school. By adopting this method of mutual assistance, the number of courses taught by teachers was reduced, which created conditions for each teacher to give full play to their expertise and improve the quality of teaching.
    Running a school diligently and thriftily is welcomed by the masses
    The simple life in the school is the biggest feature of this middle school. The teacher's office is also the dormitory. Out of the total of sixty-two students, fifteen live and eat at home because their homes are near the school, twenty students bring their own meals, twenty-two students organized a mess, and only five students from families with better living conditions joined the teacher's mess.
    We visited the student mess. The cook is called Guo Jitai, and the student mess is set up in his home. All the pots, pans, steamers, etc. in the student mess are Guo Jitai's personal property. Bowls and chopsticks are brought by the students from home. Students who join the mess bring 35 jin of flour per month, plus 3 yuan for food expenses (including the cook's 30 yuan salary, vegetable money, firewood, etc.). Each meal has a hot dish. The cook cares very much about the students in the mess. When there were no vegetable bowls, he used his own salary to buy a few vegetable bowls. The students have very little money for vegetables, but he always tries to change the variety of vegetables, sometimes bean sprouts, sometimes green vegetables. There is also a hot water stove in the school, mainly to supply all students with hot water. This stove is even simpler. The stove room is a temporary shed made of grass. The pot was borrowed from the agricultural cooperative. There is no cook. Students take turns boiling water, three students per class (matched according to boys, girls, big and small students). One class boils water for three days, three times a day. Boiling water is done during spare time, so it does not affect the students' studies.
    The cost of this middle school for students is much less than that of urban middle schools. According to the parents' calculations, the tuition fee for a student is more than 12 yuan per semester (including teachers' salaries, office expenses, miscellaneous expenses, etc.), averaging 2.6 yuan per month. Students who live and eat at school (joining the student mess) spend about 7 yuan more per month (including 35 jin of grain and 3 yuan for food). The total cost for the whole semester is 44 yuan, and the total cost for two semesters a year is 88 yuan. A student studying in a middle school in the city spends nearly 20 yuan a month (including 12 yuan for food, 3 yuan for tuition, plus travel expenses, uniform fees, etc.), 90 yuan per semester, and 180 yuan per year. Therefore, the middle school run collectively by the masses is very suitable for the economic conditions of most people. Many parents say that if it weren't for this middle school, they would not have the strength to support a student to study in a middle school in the city.
    However, the reason why this middle school is particularly popular with the masses is even more important because the students do not leave production. In particular, students who live closer to home use their spare time every day to participate in family production activities. Some use their holidays to participate in agricultural production, and some engage in sideline production such as raising pigs, grinding tofu, making straw shoes, and collecting firewood. Therefore, many students use their labor income to offset their living expenses in school.
    Students' participation in labor is forming a trend
    The teachers introduced me to the production situation of several students. Seventeen-year-old girl Li Caixia is from Xiaoshaocun, 15 miles away from the school. There is no full labor force in her family, and the family life is very difficult. She goes home every Saturday afternoon to make straw shoe soles and returns to school on Sunday afternoon. Each time, she can make seven pairs of straw shoe soles, earning 1.75 yuan. One month (calculated on the basis of four weeks) earns a total of 7 yuan. She solves the tuition problem by making straw shoe soles alone. Another boy named Liu Xueqian lives in Machang Village. Because he lives close to the school, he can participate in production in his spare time every day. He helps his father grind tofu for the agricultural cooperative every morning and evening, earning four work points a day. In half a year (excluding the busy farming season), he can earn 240 work points. He is responsible for raising two pigs. In addition to the money earned by the pigs themselves, the pig manure alone accumulates to 70 large carts a year. According to the agricultural cooperative's regulations, each cart is 9 work points, and 70 carts can earn 630 work points. In addition, he also uses Sundays and holidays to do field work for the agricultural cooperative, which can also earn 300 work points a year (from after the Spring Festival to early April, he delivered manure to the fields, and has already earned more than 140 work points). If calculated according to the value of a labor day last year (a labor day last year was allocated 1.2 yuan, and the cooperative plans to be higher than last year this year), he can be allocated more than 120 yuan this year. In addition to his expenses at school throughout the year (he eats and lives at home, and the tuition fee is only more than 11 yuan per semester, plus the cost of stationery and books, a total of more than 30 yuan a year), he can also increase the family's income by 90 yuan. According to the teachers, students' participation in labor is forming a trend. If anyone shows unwillingness to participate in labor, they will be looked down upon by the students, who consider it a sign of incompetence.
    This middle school has not been established for a long time, and there are still many problems in the school that need to be further resolved. The most important issues at present are the school leadership and agricultural courses. They urgently need specific help and guidance from the higher-level education departments.

    一所新型的初级中学
    本报记者  朱波
    长安县王曲乡马厂村，有一所群众集体办的中学。这所中学是在去年9月间建成的。全校共六十二个学生，两个教师。
    办一所中学，当然有很多困难，例如校舍、教师、远路同学的食宿等问题都需要解决。但是，这些困难并没有吓着办学的人。学校理事会按勤俭办学的精神，紧紧地依靠附近农业社的干部和群众，这些问题都顺利地解决了。例如教室，是马厂小学帮助解决的，马厂小学把两班三年级学生改为二部制，腾出了一所教室给中学用；学生的宿舍是农业社帮助解决的，农业社把农具分散各生产队组保管，腾出仓库给学生作宿舍；在农业社帮助下，雇了一个会做饭的老社员，解决了寄宿学生的吃饭问题。
    最困难的还是教学上的问题。该校共有两个教师，一个是班主任张振荣，另一个教员高永茂，这两位教师都是从小学教师中选拔出来的，虽然他们有丰富的教学经验，但是在担任初中教学任务上仍然有很多困难。这不仅是因为初中课程比小学困难，更主要的是初中课程种类多，两个教员没有办法顾得上。这个困难怎样克服呢？开学初期，由皇甫、王曲等小学的校长临时帮助教课；后来，采用互助的办法教学才把问题解决了。班主任张振荣负责给马厂小学五年级教历史，教员高永茂给小学五、六年级教自然和算术，马厂小学的教师刘永勤、马德全和郭俊哲分别担任初中班的卫生、美术、音乐和体育等课。采用这种互相帮助的办法，教员担任的课程减少了，这就有条件发挥每个教员的专长，提高了教学的质量。
    勤俭办学受到群众欢迎
    学校的生活简朴是这所中学的最大的特色。教师的办公室就是宿舍。全校共六十二个学生，有十五人因为家在学校附近，食宿在家里，二十个学生带饭吃，二十二个学生组织了一个伙食灶，只有五个家庭生活较好的同学入了教师灶。
    我们参观了学生灶。炊事员叫郭吉太，这个学生灶就设在他家里。学生灶所有的锅、盆、蒸笼等，都是郭吉太私人的。碗和筷子是学生从家带来的。入灶的同学每月带三十五斤面，另外有三元的伙食费（包括炊食员三十元工资、菜金、烧柴等）。每顿饭有一个热菜。炊事员对入灶的学生很关心，没有菜盆，他就用自己的工资买了几个菜盆。学生们菜金很少，但是，他总是想办法改变菜的花样，有时是豆芽，有时是青菜。学校里还有一个开水灶，主要是供给全体学生喝开水。这个灶更简单，灶房是一个临时搭的草棚，锅是农业社借给的，没有炊事员，由同学轮班烧水，每班三人（按男、女、大、小学生搭配着划分的），一班烧三天，一天烧三次，每天烧水都是利用课余时间，因此，并不影响学生们的学习。
    这所中学学生的费用比城市中学少多了。根据家长们计算，一个学生一学期的学费共十二元多（包括教师的工资、办公费、杂支费等），平均每月二点六元。在学校食宿的同学（入学生灶），每月多出七元左右（包括三十五斤粮，三元伙食费）。全学期共四十四元，一年两个学期共需要八十八元。而一个在城市上初中的学生，一个月的花费近二十元（包括伙食费十二元，学费三元，再加上路费、制服费等），一个学期要用九十元，全年共需要一百八十元。因此，群众集体办的中学非常适合目前大多数群众的经济条件。许多家长说，如果不是这所中学，他们没有力量供养一个学生到城市的中学去读书。
    但是，这座中学所以特别受群众欢迎，更重要的是学生都不脱离生产。特别是离家较近的同学，他们每天都利用课余的时间参加家庭的生产活动，有的利用假日参加农业生产，有的从事养猪、磨豆腐、打麻鞋、打柴等副业生产。因此，有不少同学靠自己的劳动所得抵偿了他在学校里的生活用费。
    学生参加劳动形成风气
    教师们向我介绍了几个同学参加生产的情况。十七岁的女生李彩霞，她是小少村人，离学校十五里路，全家没有一个全劳动力，家庭生活很困难。她每星期六下午回家打麻鞋底，星期天下午回校，每次可打七双麻鞋底，赚一元七角五分，一个月（按四个星期计算）共赚七元，她单靠打麻鞋底就解决了学费问题。另一个男生叫刘学谦，他家在马厂村，因为离学校近，每天课余的时间都可以参加生产。他每天早晨和晚上帮助父亲给农业社里磨豆腐，一天可以挣四分工，半年的时间（农忙季节除外），可以挣二百四十个工分。他负责养了两口猪，除猪本身赚的钱以外，光猪圈粪一年要积七十大车，按农业社的规定，每车九分工，七十车可挣六百三十个工分。此外，他还利用星期天和假期给农业社做地里活，一年也能挣三百个工分（从春节后到4月上旬，他给地里送粪，已经挣了一百四十多个工分），如果按去年的一个劳动日的价值计算（去年一个劳动日分到一点二元，今年社里计划比去年高），他今年可以分到一百二十多元，除了他的全年在学校的花费外（他在家食宿，每学期学费只有十一元多，加上文具书籍费用，一年共需要三十多元），还可以给家庭增加九十元的收入。据教师们说，同学们参加劳动形成一种风气，如果有谁表现不愿参加劳动，就会被同学们看不起，认为是一种无能的表现。
    这所中学建校的时间不长，学校里还有许多问题需要进一步解决。当前最主要的问题是学校领导和农业课程问题。他们迫切需要上级教育部门的具体帮助和指导。
