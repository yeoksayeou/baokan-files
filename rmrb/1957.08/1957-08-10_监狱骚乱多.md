    Prison Riots Frequent
    In recent years, the dark secrets of American prisons have gradually been revealed. According to the "New York Prison Association," from 1950 to 1956, nearly one hundred serious riot incidents occurred in prisons across the United States. Prison property losses exceeded ten million US dollars. The 1954 Missouri State Prison riot, in addition to causing casualties, also resulted in property losses of five million US dollars. Since 1950, two-thirds of American prisons have experienced major riots.

    监狱骚乱多
    近年以来，美国监狱黑幕逐渐揭开。据“纽约监狱协会”透露，从1950年至1956年，美国各地监狱发生严重骚乱事件将近一百起。监狱财产损失一千万美元以上。1954年米苏里州监狱暴动，除了造成伤亡事故，还损失财产五百万美元。自从1950年以来，三分之二的美国监狱都发生过重大的骚乱。
