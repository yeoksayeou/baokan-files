Editor's Note: The Wangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has strengthened its specific leadership over the hog raising industry, and various economic departments have closely cooperated, adopting correct production policies and striving to solve the problems of pig sources and feed. Therefore, the county's hog development has been very rapid. In 1955, the county raised 144,000 hogs, averaging 1.37 hogs per household. In 1956, the number of hogs reached 398,000, averaging 3.8 hogs per household. In 1957, it is planned to raise 530,000 hogs throughout the year. By the end of June, more than 480,000 hogs had been raised, completing 90.63% of the annual planned number of hogs. Wangcheng County's experience in developing hog production is very good. The report of the Ministry of Agriculture's organization of agricultural cadres from thirteen southern provinces (municipalities) to visit Wangcheng County's hog production is now published below for reference by various localities.

In order to learn from Wangcheng County's experience in developing hogs, our ministry organized cadres and agricultural production cooperative directors from thirteen provinces (municipalities) including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Shanghai, as well as units such as the Central China and Southwest Agricultural Science Research Institutes, a total of 95 people, to visit five agricultural production cooperatives in Wangcheng County in the first half of April: Shengli (representative of the lake area), Xitang, Fanshen, Yanghu (representative of the semi-hilly, semi-lake area), and Pingtan (representative of the hilly area). They also listened to Comrade Zhang Xingyu, Secretary of the Wangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, introduce the hog raising situation in the county. Everyone unanimously felt that the achievements in hog development in Wangcheng County were outstanding.

Hog Income Accounts for 50% of Rice Production Value

Wangcheng County is a semi-lake and semi-hilly area with more than 720,000 mu of cultivated land (mostly paddy fields), 96,411 farm households, and more than 462,000 agricultural population, averaging 1.5 mu of cultivated land per person. Rice is the main food crop, and farmers have always had the habit and experience of raising hogs. Since liberation, the number of hogs has increased year by year, but the growth rate has been even faster in the past two years. In 1956, more than 398,000 hogs were raised, an increase of 1.76 times compared to the previous year, exceeding the highest annual output of 180,000 hogs in 1941 by 51.9%. The county averaged 3.8 hogs per household. (Note: The July 20th edition of this newspaper reported that Wangcheng's hog raising had reached an average of more than seven hogs per household, which was incorrect.) The total output value of hogs in the county was 10,260,000 yuan, equivalent to half the output value of rice, accounting for 22.05% of the total national economic output value. On a per-household average, hog income was 106 yuan per household, equivalent to 22 yuan per person. The hog income of some agricultural cooperatives even exceeded rice income.

Due to the development of hogs, not only has people's income increased and living standards improved, but it has also reduced agricultural commodity fertilizer investment and increased grain output. In 1956, although the county suffered a severe drought, the total rice output still reached 351 million jin, exceeding the three-fixed output by 10.48 million jin, with an average yield of 544 jin per mu. The increase in fertilizer has also promoted agricultural reform. For example, double-cropping rice increased to a considerable extent in 1956.

According to the Wangcheng County Committee's summary and the discussions and research of the visiting comrades, it is believed that Wangcheng County's objective conditions for raising hogs are not particularly superior to those of other southern provinces, and some provinces have even better conditions than Wangcheng. The main reasons for the rapid development of hog production in this county are the following experiences:

The Party Committee Provides Specific Leadership for the Hog Raising Industry

    1. The most prominent feature is that the county party committee truly attaches importance to and provides specific leadership for hog production. They first started with typical investigations, deeply summarized the experience of Xitang Cooperative in raising hogs for manure, and affirmed that it was an important key to increasing grain output and increasing farmers' income; they found that self-breeding and self-raising was the best way to solve the pig source problem from the fact that Fanshen Cooperative started with three sows in 1955 and developed to 232 hogs; they also specifically calculated the county's pig source account, breeding pig account, and feed account; they also specifically held a hog raising symposium attended by 69 agricultural cooperative directors. After repeated discussions, they determined the county's policy of focusing on increasing grain production, focusing on developing hogs, developing overall production, engaging in diversified operations, and increasing people's income. They formulated a plan to develop hogs to 450,000 heads in 1956 on the basis of 144,000 hogs in 1955, put forward the slogan of "grasping rice with the right hand and hogs with the left hand, having hogs in the pens and fertilizer in the fields," mobilized the whole party, everyone started, and every household raised hogs, forming a mass hog production upsurge throughout the county.

Necessary institutions for guiding hog production were established at all levels, and cadres were replenished. The county established a Bureau of Animal Husbandry, assigned a member of the county party committee as a full-time director, and designated the deputy secretary of the township general branch, the director of the township women's federation, the deputy director of the agricultural cooperative, and the deputy captain of the production team to specifically lead hog production. Townships have veterinary clinics, and cooperatives have quarantine officers to strengthen quarantine guidance. Now there are 100 full-time cadres in the county's animal husbandry system. In order to learn from experience, the county party committee secretary personally took action and sent cadres to agricultural cooperatives with different conditions to focus on cultivating demonstrations in order to promote overall hog production.

In terms of ideological education, it was emphasized that all departments must serve production in everything, and party members, League members, and women's federation members were mobilized and educated to include hog development as one of their regular political tasks, establishing the idea that the masses should be proud of raising hogs.

Various Economic Departments Cooperate Closely

    2. Under the unified leadership of the county party committee, various economic departments clearly centered on benefiting production to arrange and improve their work, and hog production, procurement, and feed supply worked closely together. The Bureau of Animal Husbandry and the Food Company worked together on hog work. Grain and supply and marketing cooperative departments changed their ideas of being afraid of trouble and losing money in managing feed, strengthened the supply of feed, and also helped the masses restore Xiangfen processing mills. In particular, the Food Company changed its practices of suppressing grades and prices, deducting weights, and forcing the purchase of hogs that had not been fattened by the masses, and implemented the practice of integrating production and sales and subordinating sales to production. Farmers are allowed to slaughter, eat, share, sell, or sell to the state their fat hogs in addition to fulfilling the state's assigned procurement tasks. Meat and oil of eight jin are given priority to the assigned procurement households and the households raising boars and sows.

Implement the Policy of "Private Ownership, Private Raising, and Public Assistance"

    3. The policy of "private ownership, private raising, and public assistance" was conscientiously implemented. At the same time, some experience was initially accumulated from the steady development of collective hog raising. In the process of massively developing hogs in Wangcheng County in the spring of 1956, it was initially believed that collective hog raising had a large scale and was easy to show its superiority, and the policy of "relying on agricultural cooperatives to collectively raise hogs, taking into account the private raising of members" was put forward. However, due to insufficient feed, funds, and equipment at that time, and the lack of experience of cadres, a detour was taken. A large number of hogs privately raised by members were driven to the cooperatives for collective raising, and members were mobilized to vacate many houses to be used as pigsties. At that time, members' hog raising was relatively reduced, the number of empty pens increased, and due to improper management, the pigs grew slowly, died more, spent more, and earned less, and the pigs were not raised well.

In order to develop private hog raising, the county party committee comprehensively analyzed and studied the situation of empty pen households, and paid special attention to helping poor households solve the difficulties of raising hogs. In 1956, statistics showed that there were more than 21,000 empty pen households in the county, accounting for 22.5% of the total number of farm households, most of which were households in difficulty. Therefore, the county party committee organized forces to go deep into the cooperatives, teams, and households, make detailed accounts, tap the potential of hog raising, line up households to find out the situation, and formulate hog raising plans for each cooperative, team, and household, mobilize relatives and neighbors to help each other, and combine agricultural cooperatives to lend pigs and the state to provide loans. The three-fixed grain retention policy was conscientiously implemented to purchase pig manure at reasonable prices, use idle land to grow feed, and allocate feed land, etc., to gradually solve the difficulties of pig sources, funds, equipment, and feed for poor households. As a result, 94.5% of households in the county raised hogs.

In terms of collective hog raising, by the end of 1956, 333 of the 439 agricultural cooperatives in the county collectively raised more than 22,000 hogs. Collective hog raising cooperatives generally made money. The initial experience of collective hog raising is: (1) Implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally. Equipment is mainly based on fully utilizing the original dilapidated temples, ancestral halls, etc. to rebuild pigsties, saving investment. (2) Establish a solid feed base (planting feed, collectively operating grain processing workshops) to obtain sufficient and cheap feed, reducing costs. (3) Strengthen quarantine to reduce mortality losses. (4) Implement quota management and pay according to output, stimulating the enthusiasm of hog raisers. In terms of business methods, different conditions were adopted according to different regions: (1) Set up large farms for all centralized feeding. (2) Distribute and contract to production teams for raising. (3) Publicly owned pigs and public equipment are contracted to households for raising - green feed is given land by the cooperative and planted by the household.

Among the above three forms, everyone believes that the second form is better at present. The advantages are that it can make full use of the original equipment, the cooperative does not need to invest more, the feed land is allocated nearby, and the transportation of fertilizer, quarantine, and management are convenient, saving labor.

Collective hog raising has more income, is a socialist economy, can increase public accumulation, consolidate agricultural cooperatives, adopt advanced technologies, improve varieties, and drive the masses to raise hogs. According to Wangcheng County's experience, as long as there are funds, equipment, feed, technical forces, and leading backbone, agricultural cooperatives can steadily develop collective hog raising.

Solve the Problems of Pig Source, Feed, and Quarantine

    4. In guiding hog production, Wangcheng County has grasped the important links of solving pig source, feed, and disease prevention and control:

(1) Implement self-breeding and self-raising. In early 1956, the county had only more than 9,100 sows and 102 boars. After accounting, it was necessary to develop sows to 40,000 and boars to 1,000 by April in order to meet the requirement of one pig per person. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives were mobilized to formulate a plan for selecting and retaining breeding pigs. In areas where piglets were lacking, all newborn gilts were retained as sows. After the pig source was satisfied, the superior was selected and the inferior was eliminated, double mating and re-mating were promoted, and a movement to protect the fetus, protect production, protect survival, and protect fattening was fully launched. By the end of April, the difficulty of insufficient piglets was fundamentally solved.

(2) Solve the problem of hog raising feed. While massively developing hogs, attention was paid to the arrangement of feed throughout the year, and the policy of mainly relying on their own strength to solve hog raising feed locally was clarified. After investigation and research, it was found that raising a fat hog weighing 170 jin requires about 2,500 to 3,000 jin of green feed and about 300 jin of concentrate (converted to miscellaneous grains). According to this standard, agricultural cooperatives and members were mobilized to formulate feed production and supply plans according to their own hog raising plans, tap the potential of feed, and fully utilize wild vegetables, weeds, leaves, and aquatic plants in mountains, fields, and lakes. In summer, the unfinished green feed is ensiled. In autumn, sweet potato vines and other things are dried and stored. The local processing of rice was organized to grind Xiangfen. In 1956, in the three-fixed grain retention (averaging 500 jin of rice per capita), 20 jin of pig grain was retained per person according to the population, and 50 jin of subsidy grain was retained for each boar and sow. For each piglet born, the grain supply point issued a subsidy of 6.12 jin. In 1957, in addition to the self-retained land, one point of feed land was retained for each pig to grow high-yield feed crops, plus the bran and broken grain at home and the state supplied part of the commercial feed. Generally, a farm household of five people can raise two hogs all year round. In addition, water hyacinth was introduced (170,000 jin can be produced per mu of pond), small plots of wasteland were reclaimed, and land idle seasons were used to lend to members to grow a season of feed crops, which basically solved the difficulty of feed shortage in the massive development of hogs. In particular, retaining feed land is a reliable guarantee for the rapid development of hogs, and it is extremely beneficial to increase grain production. According to the experience of many local old farmers, each pig can accumulate 35 to 40 dan of manure and urine, which can increase the production of a considerable amount of rice, enough for all the concentrate consumed by a pig. Many agricultural cooperatives with many hogs have not affected grain production due to the retention of feed land.

(3) Carry out mass pig disease prevention and control: In the past, Wangcheng County had more serious pig diseases and a high mortality rate. In order to solve this problem, in 1956, more than 560 new and old veterinarians were trained, and animal clinics were established in townships or joint townships. Many agricultural cooperatives uniformly contracted prescriptions, and the prescription fees were first paid by the agricultural cooperatives and uniformly deducted during the final settlement and distribution.

Several Problems to be Solved

During the visit, everyone felt that in the massive development of hogs in Wangcheng County, there were still some new problems that existed and emerged. At the same time, these were common problems in the southern provinces that urgently needed to be solved:

First, after the massive development of hogs, concentrate is even more scarce, but on the other hand, a large number of green manure crops such as purple cloud alfalfa and vetch, which can replace concentrate, are still mostly directly turned into the fields as fertilizer and are not used as feed, which is a pity. Green manure crops have a higher protein content than bran and are nutritionally better. Approximately 1.5 jin of purple cloud alfalfa hay has the nutritional value of 1 jin of bran. In 1957, the area under green manure cultivation in the southern provinces was approximately more than 58 million mu. If 400 jin of green manure crops were harvested per mu for feed, 4.69 billion jin of purple cloud alfalfa hay could be harvested, which could be used to offset 3.126 billion jin of bran, which could replace the bran concentrate needed for more than 7.81 million hogs, which can not only alleviate the difficulty of feed, but also reduce the pressure on grain. In terms of feeding methods, research and improvement are also needed. For example, boiling vegetables and radishes before feeding pigs reduces the nutritional content and wastes fuel (the fuel cost of feed for each pig is about 3 yuan) and manpower. It is best to persuade the masses to directly wash and feed green or heat and disinfect before feeding. If silage can be widely promoted, it can be used for a long time to solve the difficulty of feed shortage in winter and spring. This is a big thing and should be paid attention to.

Second, the pig source has been solved, and there is a surplus of piglets, but there is a lot of inbreeding, and most of the boars and sows are mated too early, resulting in low litter rates and deterioration in quality. In the future, attention should be paid to selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior, and it is recommended that agricultural cooperatives regularly exchange breeding boars. County breeding pig farms should breed a large number of high-quality breeding boars and sows to help agricultural cooperatives and members carry out hog economic hybridization.

Third, further cultivate technical forces and improve pig disease prevention and control. In 1956, more than 31,000 pigs died in the county, with a mortality rate of 8%, which was a great loss. The existing veterinarians cannot meet the needs of prevention and control work due to their low technical level. In particular, after the massive development of hogs, it is not enough to rely solely on carrying out the white pig pen movement and giving vaccinations. They should be trained in batches and improved in a planned way. At the same time, the issue of quarantine remuneration should be resolved reasonably, and attention should also be paid to correcting the problem that more than half of the trained quarantine officers have changed their careers and professions, and efforts should be made to eliminate diseases such as swine fever and swine erysipelas in the short term.

This visit was a success. At the end of 1956, Wangcheng County raised one pig per 2.9 mu of land on average, and one pig per 1.8 mu of land on average based on the annual feeding amount. The natural conditions in other parts of the South are generally not worse than those in Wangcheng. If it is done well, it is possible to gradually raise one pig per 4 mu of land on average. There are more than 687 million mu of cultivated land in the thirteen provinces (municipalities) in the South. Roughly calculated, more than 170 million hogs can be raised, an increase of more than 1.36 times compared with the 72 million hogs in stock at the end of 1956. This shows that the potential for raising hogs is great.

    为什么望城的生猪增加得特别快
    农业部组织南方十三个省（市）部分农业干部参观后的报告
    编者按：湖南省望城县委对养猪事业加强了具体领导，各经济部门密切配合，采取了正确的生产方针和政策，尽力解决了猪源和饲料问题。因此，这个县生猪发展很快，1955年全县养猪十四万四千头，平均每户一点三七头，1956年猪数达到三十九万八千多头，平均每户三点八头。1957年计划全年养猪五十三万头，到6月底已达四十八万多头，完成全年计划饲养数的90.63％。望城县发展生猪生产的经验是很好的。现将农业部组织南方十三个省（市）部分干部参观望城县养猪生产的报告发表于下，供各地参考。
    为了学习望城县发展生猪的经验，我部曾组织江苏、浙江、安徽、湖北、湖南、江西、福建、广东、广西、四川、云南、贵州、上海等十三个省（市）农业厅（局）及华中、西南农业科学研究所等单位的干部、农业生产合作社主任共九十五人，于4月上半月到望城县胜利（代表湖区）、西塘、翻身、洋湖（代表半丘陵、半湖区）、坪田（代表丘陵区）等五个农业生产合作社参观，并听了中共望城县委书记张兴玉同志对全县养猪情况的介绍。大家一致感到望城县生猪发展的成绩是突出的。
    养猪收入占稻谷产值的50％
    望城县是一个半湖半丘陵地带，共有耕地七十二万多亩（绝大部分为水田），农户九万六千四百十一户，农业人口四十六万二千多人，平均每人有耕地一亩五分。粮食作物以稻谷为主，农民向来有养猪的习惯和经验。解放以来，历年生猪头数都有增加，但近两年来，增长速度更快。1956年养猪三十九万八千多头，比上年增加一点七六倍，超过历史最高年产量1941年十八万头的51.9％，全县平均每户养猪三点八头。（按：7月20日本报四版报道望城养猪每户平均已达七头多，有误。）全县生猪总产值为一千零二十六万元，相当稻谷产值的一半，占国民经济总产值的22.05％，按农户平均，养猪收入每户为一百零六元，每人折合二十二元。有些农业社养猪收入甚至超过稻谷收入。
    由于生猪的发展，不但增加了人民收入，改善了生活，同时减少了农业商品肥料投资，提高了粮食产量。1956年全县虽然遭受了严重的旱灾，稻谷总产量仍达三亿五千一百万斤，超过三定产量一千零四十八万斤，平均亩产五百四十四斤。由于肥料增加，还推进了农业改制工作。如双季稻在1956年有相当程度的增加。
    根据望城县委的总结和参观同志的讨论研究，认为望城县养猪的客观条件并不比南方其他省有什么特别优越，有些省的条件还比望城好。而这个县生猪生产发展这样快的原因，主要有以下几点经验：党委具体领导养猪事业
    一、最突出的是县委真正重视和具体领导了生猪生产。他们首先从典型调查入手，深入总结了西塘社养猪积肥的经验，肯定了它是提高粮食产量、增加农民收入的重要关键；从翻身社由1955年三头母猪起家，发展到二百三十二头猪的实事中，找出了自繁自养是解决猪源的最好办法；又具体的算了全县猪源账、种猪账、饲料账；还专门召开了六十九个农业社社长参加的养猪座谈会，经过反复讨论，确定了全县以增产粮食为中心，以发展生猪为重点，发展全面生产，多种经营，增加人民收入的方针。制定了1956年在1955年十四万四千头生猪的基础上，发展生猪四十五万头，每人养猪一头的计划，提出了“右手抓稻谷，左手抓生猪，栏里有猪，田里有肥”的口号，全党动员，人人动手，户户养猪，形成了全县群众性的养猪生产高潮。
    层层建立了指导生猪生产的必要机构，充实了干部。县设立畜牧局，派一个县委委员任专职局长，指定乡总支副书记、乡妇女主任、农业社副社长、生产队副队长等专门领导生猪生产，乡设有家畜诊疗所，社设防疫员，加强防疫指导工作。现在全县畜牧局系统即有专职干部一百人。为了吸取经验，县委书记还亲自动手，并派出干部驻在不同条件的农业社进行重点培养示范，以推动全面生猪生产工作。
    在思想教育方面，强调各部门必须一切为生产服务，动员教育党团员、妇联会员将发展生猪列为经常的政治任务之一，树立了广大群众养猪劳动光荣的思想。各个经济部门密切配合
    二、在县委统一领导下，各个经济部门都明确以有利于生产为中心，来安排和改进自己的工作，作到了生猪生产、收购和饲料供应工作紧密配合，畜牧局和食品公司更在生猪工作上打成了一片。粮食、供销合作部门改变了经营饲料怕麻烦、怕赔钱的思想，加强了饲料供应工作，还帮助群众恢复了湘粉加工磨子。特别是食品公司改变了压级压价，考槽扣秤，强迫收购群众未育肥的生猪等作法，实行了产销结合，购销服从生产的作法。农民完成国家派购任务以外的肥猪，允许自宰、自食，自宰分食，自宰出售或卖给国家。对派购户、养公母猪户优先供应肉、油八斤。
    贯彻“私有、私养、公助”方针
    三、认真贯彻了“私有、私养、公助”为主的方针，同时从稳步发展集体养猪中也初步积累了一些经验。望城县1956年春季大量发展生猪的过程中，开始认为集体养猪场面大，容易显示优越性，提出“依靠农业社集体养猪，兼顾社员私养”的方针，曾走过一段弯路，由于当时饲料、资金、设备都不足，干部缺乏经验，曾把大批社员私养猪赶到社里集体养起来，并动员社员腾出许多房子做猪舍，当时社员养猪相对减少了，空栏户增多了，加上管理不当，猪长的慢、死的多、开支大、收入少，没有把猪养好。
    为发展私人养猪，县委曾全面地分析研究了空栏户的情况，特别注意帮助贫困户解决养猪的困难。1956年统计全县共有空栏户二万一千多户，占总农户的22.5％，这些大都是困难户。因此，县委即组织力量深入到社、到队、到户，算细账，挖掘养猪潜力，按户排队摸底，逐社、逐队、逐户制定养猪计划，发动亲邻相帮，群众互助互济，结合农业社贷猪、国家贷款帮助，认真执行三定留粮政策，以合理价格收购猪粪，利用休闲地种饲料及拨给饲料地等多种办法，逐步解决了贫困户猪源、资金、设备、饲料等困难。由此，全县养猪户达到94.5％。
    集体养猪方面，到1956年底全县四百三十九个农业社中有三百三十三个社集体养猪共二万二千多头。集体养猪社一般都赚了钱。集体养猪的初步经验是：（1）贯彻勤俭办社的方针，设备以充分利用原有的破庙、破祠堂等改建猪栏为主，节省了投资。（2）建立巩固的饲料基地（种植饲料，集体经营粮食加工作坊）获得充足的廉价饲料，降低了成本。（3）加强防疫，减少了死亡损失。（4）实行定额管理，按产记酬，刺激了养猪员的积极性。在经营方式上，根据不同地区不同条件采取了：（1）设大场全部集中饲养。（2）分散包给生产队养。（3）公有猪，公设备包给户养——青饲料由社里给地，由户种植。
    以上三种形式中，大家认为目前以第二种形式比较好。好处是能充分利用原有设备，社里不需要多投资，就近拨给饲料地，运送肥料，防疫与管理都方便，节省劳力。
    集体养猪收入多，是社会主义的经济，可以增加公共积累，巩固农业社，采取先进技术，改良品种，带动群众养猪。根据望城县的经验，只要具有资金设备，饲料技术力量和领导骨干，农业社是可以稳步发展集体养猪的。
    解决猪源、饲料、防疫问题
    四、在指导生猪生产中，望城县抓住了解决猪源、饲料及疫病防治等问题的重要环节：
    （1）实行自繁自养。该县1956年初仅有母猪九千一百多头，公猪一百零二头，经过算账，必须到4月母猪发展到四万头，公猪一千头，这样才能达到一人一猪的要求，遂发动农业社制定了选留种猪计划，仔猪缺乏的地区，把新生的小母猪全部留作母猪。在猪源满足以后，再进行选优去劣，推广双配和复配，全面开展了保胎、保产、保成活、保肥育的运动。到4月底根本上解决了仔猪不足的困难。
    （2）解决养猪饲料。在大量发展生猪的同时，就注意到全年饲料的安排，明确了主要依靠自身力量，就地解决养猪饲料的方针。经过调查研究，养一头一百七十斤重的肥猪，从小到大约需青饲料二千五百到三千斤，精料（折杂粮）三百斤左右。根据这个标准，发动农业社和社员按照自己养猪的计划，制定饲料生产供应计划，挖掘饲料潜力，充分利用山上和地里的野菜、野草、树叶子，湖塘里的水生植物。在夏天把喂不完的青饲料青贮起来。秋天将红薯藤等干贮起来。组织了稻谷就地加工，磨制湘粉。1956年在三定留粮中（平均每人口粮稻谷五百斤），按人口每人留猪粮二十斤，公、母猪每头另留补助粮五十斤，每生一头小猪由粮食供应点发给补助粮六斤十二两。1957年除了自留地以外，又给每头猪留一分饲料地种高产饲料作物，加上家里的糠碎和国家供应部分商品饲料，一般五口之家的农户，常年可以养猪两头。此外，还引种了水浮莲（每亩塘可产十七万斤），开垦小片荒地，利用土地休闲季节，借给社员种一季饲料作物，基本上解决了生猪大发展中饲料紧张的困难。特别是留饲料地是迅速的发展生猪的可靠保证，而且对增产粮食极为有利。根据当地许多老农的经验，每头猪可积粪尿三十五至四十担，可增产相当数量的稻谷，足够一头猪消耗的全部精料。许多养猪多的农业社，都没有因留了饲料地而影响粮食产量。
    （3）开展群众性的猪疫防治工作：望城县过去猪疫较严重，死亡率很大。为了解决这个问题，1956年训练了新、老兽医五百六十多人，以乡或联乡建立了家畜诊疗所，不少农业社由社统一包方，包方费先由农业社代付，在决算分配时统一扣回。
    几个有待解决的问题
    在参观过程中，大家感到望城县在生猪大量发展中，也还存在和出现了一些新的问题，这同时是南方各省共同存在而极待解决的问题：
    第一，生猪大量发展后，精料更加紧张，但是另一方面，大量可以代替精料的紫云英、苕子等绿肥作物，仍大部直接翻在田里作肥料，没有利用作饲料，这是很可惜的。绿肥作物蛋白质含量比糠麸还高，营养成分好，大约一斤半紫云英干草的营养价值可以抵一斤麸皮。南方各省1957年绿肥栽培面积约有五千八百多万亩，如果每亩割取四百斤绿肥作物作饲料，可收取四十六亿九千万斤紫云英干草，共可抵三十一亿二千六百万斤的麸皮，可以代替七百八十一万多头猪所需的麸皮精料，不仅可缓和饲料困难，也可减轻粮食紧张的压力。在喂用方法上，也还需要研究改进，如将白菜、萝卜等煮熟后喂猪，这样既降低了营养成分，又浪费了燃料（每头猪饲料的燃料费约需三元）、人力，最好说服群众直接洗净青喂或加热消毒后喂用。如能大量推广青贮，还可长期利用，解决冬春饲料缺乏的困难，这是一件很大的事情，应该加以重视。
    第二，目前猪源已经解决，仔猪且有剩余，但近亲繁殖多，公、母猪大多配种过早，以致产仔率低，品质退化，今后应该注意选优去劣，提倡农业社定期交换种公猪。县种猪场应大量繁殖优良种公、母猪，帮助农业社和社员进行生猪经济杂交。
    第三，进一步培养技术力量，提高猪疫防治工作。1956年全县死猪三万一千多头，死亡率8％，损失很大。现有兽医多因技术水平低，不能满足防治工作的需要，特别是生猪大量发展后，仅依靠开展白猪栏运动和打防疫针是不够的。应该对他们有计划的分批训练提高。同时防疫报酬问题应该合理解决，受过训的防疫员，现有半数以上改行转业的问题也应注意纠正，力使在短期内消灭猪瘟、猪丹毒等疫病。
    这次参观是成功的。望城县1956年末平均每二点九亩地养一头猪，按全年饲养量平均一点八亩地一头，南方其他各地自然条件一般不比望城坏，如果搞得好，逐步做到平均每四亩地养一头猪是可能的。南方十三个省（市）共有耕地六亿八千七百多万亩，粗略计算，可以养猪一亿七千多万头，比1956年末存栏七千二百多万头，增加一点三六倍多。这说明养猪潜力是很大的。
