　　After repeated exposure and criticism by staff members of the Ministry of Light Industry, rightist Tang Gongjie admitted that he accepted instructions from Zhang Bojun to carry out criminal activities against the Communist Party and socialism in the Ministry of Light Industry.

　　Tang Gongjie was an editor at the Publishing House of the Ministry of Light Industry and a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. After the start of the rectification movement, he spread a large number of reactionary remarks in the Ministry of Light Industry that slandered the Communist Party and socialism. In late May and early June, he incited staff members of the Publishing House to engage in "big democracy" three times, attempting to stir up riots. He incited the staff of the publishing house, saying that the director of the general office "cannot lead, nor does he push forward or let go. Does he want us to hold a big democracy petition?" He also said: "Bureaucracy in the Ministry of Light Industry is serious, and the future is unimaginable. The only way is to have a big democracy petition."

　　According to Tang Gongjie's own confession, he and Zhang Bojun had known each other for a long time and had frequent interactions. After the start of the rectification movement, Zhang Bojun gave him personal instructions, telling him to actively attack the Communist Party in the Ministry of Light Industry in the name of helping the Communist Party with the rectification, saying that even if he did not understand the situation, he could use other people's opinions. Zhang Bojun wanted him to vigorously develop the organization in the Ministry of Light Industry as capital for the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to attack the Communist Party. When he left Zhang Bojun's home, Zhang Bojun specifically instructed him not to tell others about these words.

　　After the start of the rectification, he first followed the strategy provided by Zhang Bojun, using the opinions put forward by the masses to the Communist Party, exaggerating and distorting them to attack the prestige of the Communist Party and its leadership. For example, the former director of the Paper Making Bureau was dismissed in the past for making mistakes in his work. Some staff members did not understand the situation and put out a big-character poster. Tang Gongjie immediately wrote a poem, in which he described the incident as "a three-character injustice reappearing today," meaning that the leadership framed the former director of the Paper Making Bureau with a trumped-up charge and demanded that the Party group conduct a review.

　　When Tang Gongjie was recruiting troops in the Ministry of Light Industry according to Zhang Bojun's instructions, he exhausted the methods of a double-dealer. On the one hand, he declared to the public that "the Communist Party does not allow the democratic parties to develop, making the democratic parties have no successors." On the other hand, he adopted the method of casting a wide net, preparing to develop dozens of people in the Ministry of Light Industry, establish a branch, and have him serve as the director of the branch. Someone wanted to solicit the opinions of Communist Party members before joining the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, but Tang Gongjie stopped him, saying: "Our democratic parties develop independently and do not need to consult with the Communist Party." Once, when they were talking about the constitution of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, someone next to them just glanced at it, and Tang Gongjie quickly said: "Do you also want to join our party? Welcome! Welcome!" This person was thus listed as a development target.

　　According to reports, Tang Gongjie infiltrated our Muyang Anti-Japanese Democratic Government in 1940, but soon left voluntarily because of the harsh environment. After he rejoined the work in the liberated areas in 1941, he secretly served the landlord class, opposed rent reduction and interest reduction, and defected to the enemy in 1946. In the same year, he wrote articles in Kuomintang newspapers to slander the Communist Party.

### 章伯钧是他的牵线人　汤公介在轻工业部兴风作浪

　　章伯钧是他的牵线人
　　汤公介在轻工业部兴风作浪
    本报特约新华社专稿　经过轻工业部工作人员多次揭发批判，右派分子汤公介承认他接受章伯钧的指使，在轻工业部进行反共、反社会主义的罪恶活动。
    汤公介是轻工业部出版社编辑、农工民主党党员。他在整风运动开始以后，在轻工业部散播了大量诬蔑共产党和社会主义的反动言论，并且在5月下旬和6月上旬三次煽动轻工业部出版社工作人员搞“大民主”，企图掀起暴乱。他向出版社工作人员煽动说，办公厅主任“既不能领导，又不推不放，是不是要我们来个大民主请愿呢？”又说：“轻工业部官僚主义严重，前途不堪设想，只有来个大民主请愿。”
    据汤公介自己交代，他和章伯钧早就相识，有过多次往来。整风运动开始后，章伯钧曾给他面授机宜，叫他在轻工业部以帮助共产党整风为名，积极向共产党进攻，说即使是自己不了解情况，也可以利用别人的意见。章伯钧要他在轻工业部大力发展组织，作为农工民主党向共产党进攻的资本。在他离开章伯钧家的时候，章伯钧还特别嘱咐他这些话不要向别人说。
    整风开始以后，他首先按照章伯钧提供的策略，利用群众向共产党提出的意见，加以夸大歪曲，打击共产党和领导的威信。比如前造纸局局长过去因工作中犯了错误受到撤职处分，有些工作人员不了解情况，出了一张大字报，汤公介马上就写了一首诗，诗中把这件事说成是“三字冤狱今再见”，就是说领导上以“莫须有”的罪名陷害了前造纸局局长，要求党组检查。
    汤公介根据章伯钧的指示在轻工业部招兵买马的时候，用尽了两面派的手法。他一面扬言于众，说“共产党不让民主党派发展，使民主党派后继无人”，一面却采用撒大网的办法，准备在轻工业部发展几十人，建立一个支部，并且由他作支部主任。有人在参加农工民主党以前想征求共产党员的意见，汤公介便加以阻拦说：“我们民主党派是独立发展，不必和共产党商量。”有一次当他们在谈农工民主党党章的时候，旁边有一个人只是看了一眼，汤公介就连忙说：“你也想参加我们的党吗？欢迎！欢迎！”这个人就这样被列为发展对象。
    据揭露，汤公介在1940年曾混入我沐阳抗日民主政府，不久因为环境艰苦自动脱离。1941年他再度参加解放区的工作以后，又暗地为地主阶级效劳，反对减租减息，并且在1946年叛变投敌。同年，他曾在国民党报纸上写文章诬蔑共产党。
