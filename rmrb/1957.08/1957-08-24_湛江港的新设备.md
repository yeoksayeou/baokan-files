　　New Equipment at Zhanjiang Port

　　In Zhanjiang Port, the sight of porters carrying goods on their shoulders is now gone. Massive gantry cranes unload goods such as giant milling machines and automobiles from foreign countries from ships onto trains. Large quantities of tung oil and bristles destined for export are also transferred by gantry cranes from trains to the various holds of ships. Goods temporarily stored in warehouses are moved by versatile electric flatbed trucks. These Czech-made Type 3-104 electric flatbed trucks can automatically lift and lower cargo and can load and unload goods from any angle, which is extremely convenient.

　　Where did the original port porters go? After a short period of training, some are now operating gantry cranes; some are in warehouses operating switches, dispatching goods; and many more are driving electric flatbed trucks.

　　The sounds of machinery and motors fill the port day and night. The efficiency of the machines is very high. Recently, the British ship "Matinena" brought 10,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, which was completely transferred from the ship to trains in just three days, and quickly transported via the Li-Zhan Railway to Sichuan and Guizhou.

　　The port's warehouses are connected to the railway, and each warehouse has a rooftop corridor. The railway runs alongside the corridor, and electric conveyor belts are used for loading and unloading goods. It is said that this is also one of the most modern handling equipment in the world today.

　　湛江港的新设备
    在湛江港，已经看不到掮抬货物的搬运工人了。来自国外的巨型铣床、汽车等物资，都是由巨大的龙门吊车从轮船上卸到火车上去；运往国外的大宗桐油、猪鬃等货物，也是由龙门吊车从火车上运到轮船的各个舱位。那些暂时入库的物资，也由万能的电板车搬运，这种捷克式的3—104型电板车，能自动升降，能从任何一个角度装卸货物，方便极了。
    原来港口的搬运工人哪里去了呢？他们经过短时期的训练以后，有的在驾驶龙门吊车；有的在仓库里操纵着电纽，调度物资；更多的是驾驶电板车。
    港口上，机械声、马达声整日不停。机器的搬运效率非常高，日前英轮“玛地伦娜号”运来了一万吨化学肥料，只三天时间便全部从船上运到火车上，很快地从黎湛铁路转运到四川和贵州去。
    港口的仓库与铁路连在一起，每个仓库都有一条屋顶走廊，走廊边上是铁路，装卸货物的时候，都有电板带传递。据说，这也是目前世界上最新式搬运的设备之一。
