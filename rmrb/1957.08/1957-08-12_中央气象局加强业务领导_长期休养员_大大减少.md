    Central Meteorological Bureau Strengthens Professional Leadership
    "Long-term Sick Leave Takers" Greatly Reduced

    (Our Dispatch) The Central Meteorological Bureau, while counterattacking the rightists, has also resolved some problems that could be solved. In terms of welfare, the Meteorological Bureau headquarters, the Beijing Meteorological Research Institute, and the Meteorological School have all abolished the "middle-level" mess halls. The bureau internally adjusted office space and family dormitories, and the school abolished the regulation of allocating chairs according to rank. The use of private cars has been greatly reduced, and some leading comrades now take public buses when traveling on official business. The leadership style of various units has also been initially improved, with leaders personally receiving visitors and taking the initiative to talk to some comrades.

    In order to strengthen professional leadership and research work, a group of technical personnel has been promoted to enrich and strengthen the leadership. The personnel department has also actively dealt with some cadres who have not been assigned work for a long time, and there are very few "long-term sick leave takers" in the guesthouse. Improving professional issues is more complicated. In order to carry out this work in a thorough and detailed manner, several work improvement groups have been established in each grassroots unit to specifically study the criticisms and suggestions raised by the masses and propose improvement methods.

    中央气象局加强业务领导
    “长期休养员”大大减少
    本报讯　中央气象局在反击右派的同时，又解决了一些可以解决的问题。在生活福利方面，气象局本部、北京气象研究所、气象学校都取消了中灶，局内调整了办公用房和家属宿舍，学校内取消了按级分配椅子的规定。私用小汽车的情况大大减少，有的领导同志因公外出也改乘公共汽车。各单位的领导作风也有了初步改进，亲自接见来访的人，并主动找一些同志谈话。
    为了加强业务领导及研究工作，提拔一批技术人员充实与加强了领导力量。人事部门对长期没有分配工作的一些干部，也积极进行了处理，招待所里很少有“长期休养员”了。改进业务问题比较复杂，为了深入细致地进行此项工作，各基层单位分别成立若干个改进工作的小组，专门研究群众提出的批评与建议，并提出改进办法。
