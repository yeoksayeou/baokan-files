　　Rightists in Small and Medium Cities

　　Li Xingwen, who wanted to compete with the Party newspaper
　　Li Xingwen, director of the General Editorial Office of the Andong Daily, proposed in May this year to create an evening newspaper that was "not under the leadership of the Party Committee and would compete with the Party newspaper." He said that this newspaper would allow "reporters to interview whatever they want and report on things that the Party newspaper cannot report." Li Xingwen actively campaigned for the preparation of this "evening newspaper." He also planned to speak at the city's CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) meeting to win the support of democratic parties and people from all walks of life. Currently, the masses are exposing his various conspiracies to prepare the "evening newspaper."

　　Wu Chao, who wanted to use the Golden Cicada Sheds its Shell ploy
　　Wu Chao, a teacher at Anshun Normal School in Guizhou, spoke wildly at a symposium of Anshun cultural, educational, and health circles in June, saying, "Under all of heaven, there is no land that is not the Party's; on all the land, there is no one who is not a Party member." He believed that "only the democracy of Hyde Park in England can be considered true democracy." He cursed Party members as "princes" and "Party aristocrats," and cursed activists as "slaves." After the anti-Rightist struggle began, Wu Chao wrote in his diary, "The Golden Cicada Sheds its Shell ploy may be unavoidable," and he used this tactic to make five false self-criticisms. But the people's eyes are discerning, and his "Golden Cicada Sheds its Shell ploy" was immediately seen through by everyone. Everyone warned him that he could not shed his "shell" unless he bowed his head and confessed his crimes.

　　中小城市的右派分子
    要和党报唱对台戏的李兴文
    安东日报总编室主任李兴文今年5月份提出要创办一张“不受党委的领导，和党报唱对台戏的”晚报。他说，这张报纸“记者愿意采访什么就采访什么，报道党报所不能报道的东西”。李兴文为这张“晚报”的筹备工作积极奔走。他还准备在市的政协会议上发言，争取民主党派、社会人士的支持。目前群众正在揭发他筹备“晚报”的各种阴谋活动。
    想使用金蝉脱壳计的吴超
    贵州安顺师范学校教员吴超6月份在安顺文教卫生界座谈会上大放厥词说：“普天之下，莫非党土，率土之滨，莫非党员”。他认为“只有英国海德公园的民主才算真正的民主”。他咒骂党员是“王子”“党贵族”；咒骂积极分子是“奴才”。反右派斗争开始后，吴超在自己日记中写道：“金蝉脱壳计恐亦难免”，他就用这种计策作了五次假检讨。但人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他的“金蝉脱壳计”马上被大家识破了。大家正告他，除了低头认罪外，“壳”是脱不了的。
