Xinhua News Agency report: Is it good to open the free vegetable market under state leadership? The head of the City Services Department made the following comments to Xinhua News Agency reporters: Since the opening of the free vegetable market under state leadership, we have gained an experience: when supply exceeds demand, opening the free market can solve the problems of diverse varieties, fresh quality, and convenient purchase; when supply falls short of demand, opening the free market will cause peddlers to play a destructive role, vegetable prices will rise, and the supply situation will become even more tense. Whether or not to open the free vegetable market in various regions should be determined based on whether vegetable production is sufficient and whether the supply is tight. In the case of insufficient vegetable production and tight supply, the free market may not be opened.
    When the free vegetable market is not open, attention should be paid to reducing operating links, reducing costs, and taking into account consumers' requirements for variety, freshness, and convenience in purchasing vegetables. At the same time, we should try to organize collective catering units and joint purchase and sales groups to directly link up with agricultural cooperatives, and appropriately increase the number of temporary vegetable sellers. When the free vegetable market is open, state-owned companies must directly operate a certain proportion of vegetables. State-owned companies must operate more of the bulk varieties that people need in large quantities and are easy to store; they can operate less in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. In terms of price control, all regions should pay attention to stabilizing the overall annual price level, but there should also be reasonable seasonal and quality price differences. The basic key to stabilizing vegetable prices lies in balancing supply and demand. When there is a shortage of vegetables, prices should be more expensive, but they should not be allowed to be too much higher than the normal level; when there are many vegetables, prices should be cheaper, but they should not be allowed to be lower than the production cost or rot in the hands of producers. The state must guarantee producers a reasonable income.
    In short, the management of the vegetable market is a complex issue, and the situation varies from place to place. Various regions can flexibly grasp it according to the specific situation.

    蔬菜自由市场应不应开放？
    城市服务部负责人发表谈话
    据新华社讯  开放蔬菜自由市场究竟好不好？城市服务部负责人对新华社记者发表了如下的意见：自从开放国家领导下的蔬菜自由市场以来，我们取得了一条经验：供过于求时，开放自由市场可以解决品种多样、质量新鲜、购买方便的问题；供不应求时，开放自由市场，小贩就会起破坏作用，菜价就会上涨，供应情况就会更加紧张。各地是否开放蔬菜自由市场，应该根据蔬菜生产是否足够、供应是否紧张来决定。在蔬菜生产不足、供应紧张的情况下，可以不开放自由市场。
  在不开放蔬菜自由市场的时候，要注意减少经营环节、降低成本、并照顾到消费者关于品种多样、质量新鲜、买菜方便的要求。同时要尽量组织集体伙食单位、联购联销组与农业社直接挂钩，适当地增加些临时的卖菜人员等。在开放蔬菜自由市场的时候，国营公司必须直接经营一定比重的蔬菜。凡是人民需要量大、易于保管储存的大宗品种，国营公司必须多经营；夏、秋两季则可以比冬、春两季少经营。在价格掌握上，各地应该注意稳定全年价格水平，但也要有合理的季节差价和品质差价。稳定菜价的基本关键在于供求平衡，缺菜时菜价就要贵些，但不能听其高于常年水平太多；菜多时菜价就要贱些，但不能听其低于生产成本或烂在生产者手中，国家必须保证生产者有合理收益。
    总之，蔬菜市场的管理是个复杂的问题，而且各地情况不一，各地可以根据具体情况灵活掌握。
