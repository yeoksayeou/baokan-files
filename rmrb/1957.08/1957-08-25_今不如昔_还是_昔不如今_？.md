　　"Is the Present Worse Than the Past" or "Is the Past Not as Good as the Present?"
    After this year's wheat harvest, a noteworthy situation emerged in the Gangshi Agricultural Cooperative in Linying County, Henan. This year, the weather was favorable, and the grain harvest was larger than in the past (though slightly less than last year's bumper harvest). The state requisitioned 40,000 fewer jin of grain from the cooperative based on the "Three Fixes" policy. However, many cooperative members complained that the "quota per person" grain ration standard was too low. Some bad elements were spreading rumors everywhere, saying, "The agricultural cooperative has ruined the crops, there was more grain when we worked individually," "The grain has all been taken away by the government!" "Since the implementation of unified purchase and sale, farmers are constantly complaining about not having enough to eat." In short, they claimed that farmers' lives were "worse than in the past."

      "Is it true that the cooperative produces less grain than when working individually?" When Gangshi cooperative members discussed this question, 70-year-old Shi Jinli said, "That's nonsense. I've been farming my whole life. When I was a kid, if we could harvest 80 jin of wheat per mu, it was a bumper year. But this year, the cooperative planted over 10,000 mu of wheat, averaging over 210 jin per mu. Some high-yield areas harvested over 400 jin per mu. How can they blatantly lie?"

    "Has the grain all been taken away by the state?" Cooperative member Shi Heling said, "This year, some households received slightly less grain than last year, while others received more. Overall, it wasn't much different from last year and was higher than the previous two years. Last year, grain was distributed equally based on population during the wheat season, which was somewhat unreasonable. This year, this bias was corrected and changed to a 'quota per person.' The grain ration for households with many adults and few children has been reduced. It is groundless to say that the state has taken it all away. In fact, the state's requisitioning task this year has been reduced compared to last year."

    Is farmers' lives really "worse than in the past?" Shi Yanlin slammed the table angrily and said, "I disagree with this statement. Everyone knows that when I separated from my family in 1943, I didn't even have half a room, and I lived under the eaves for years. Now I have built three brick houses. In the past, I was running around day and night, enduring hunger for half the day. My wife stayed at home for more than two months and only ate five sheng of bran and two bamboo baskets of sweet potatoes. Others had it even harder. Some starved to death, some sold their daughters, and even more fled famine and begged for food. In the past, when the oil seller beat his clapper, how many households could afford to buy oil? Now everyone is scrambling to buy it.”

### “今不如昔”还是“昔不如今”？

　　比比·算算·想想·看看
　　“今不如昔”还是“昔不如今”？
    今年麦收后，在河南临颍县岗石农业社里出现了一种值得注意的情况。就是今年风调雨顺，粮食比过去收得多（比去年丰收年稍有减产），国家对该社按“三定”政策少征购了四万斤粮食，但社员中叫喊今年“以人定量”的吃粮标准低的为数不少。一些坏分子到处叫喊不够吃，从各方面放出空气说：“农业社叫庄稼长坏啦，没有单干时打粮食多”，“粮食都叫政府弄走啦”！“实行统购统销，成天农民吵着没啥吃”。总之一句话，农民生活“今不如昔”了。
      “合作社真正没有单干时打粮食多吗？”岗石社社员在讨论这个问题时，七十岁的石金立说：“这是胡说八道，我做一辈子庄稼活，拿我小时候来说，小麦每亩能收八十斤就是丰收年；而今年全社种一万多亩小麦，每亩平均合二百一十多斤。有的丰产地，每亩收四百斤出圈。怎么能睁眼说瞎话呢？
    “粮食都叫国家弄走了吗？”社员石合岭说，今年小麦有些户比去年少分了一些，有些户则比去年多了一些，总的来说比去年不少多少，比前两年都有所增加。去年麦季粮食是按人口平均分配，有些不合理，今年纠正了这个偏向，改为：“以人定量”，大人少小孩多的户口粮是减少了，如果说是叫国家弄走啦，这是没有根据的。实际上今年国家的征购任务比去年还有减少。
    农民的生活真的“今不如昔”吗？石彦林拍桌子气愤地说：“我不同意这种说法。谁都知道，1943年我从家中分居出来时，半间房子也没有，成年住在房檐下；现在我盖了三间瓦房。过去我昼夜在外奔跑，一天得忍半天饥；我老婆在家两个多月，只吃了五升糠谷和两竹篮红芋。比我更难的还有呢，有饿死的，有卖闺女的，逃荒、要饭的就更多了。过去卖油的梆子敲炸啦，有几户买油吃？现在抢着买。
