Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang – The struggle against bourgeois rightists in Jiangxi Province's provincial organs is being carried out in depth. Since the end of June, more than 150 units and over 19,000 people have actively participated in this struggle. While persisting in their work, they actively participated in large and small meetings, wrote big-character posters and wall posters, exposing and criticizing the reactionary words and deeds and ugly faces of the rightists.

Under the masses' righteous accusations and exposures, the rightists have been completely exposed. Rightists Luo Shifeng, a trainee editor of "Spark" magazine, and Qi Zhixin, a literary editor of "Jiangxi Daily," had organized and planned attacks on the Party, slandering the literary and artistic undertakings led by the Party as "utterly dark." Luo Shifeng proposed to reduce the authority of the editor-in-chief, abolish the Party's leadership over literary and artistic publications, and also slandered the magazine's Party member editor-in-chief as "the person who checks and verifies passes," cursing the socialist system as a system "without any humanity or conscience." Rightist Han Zhang of the Provincial Highway Transportation Bureau proposed to amend the Constitution, demanding the dissolution of the National People's Congress, the National Political Consultative Conference, and the Communist Party of China. These rightists have all been thoroughly exposed.

In countering these rightists, all organs have adhered to reasoning struggle, using facts to refute the various slanders of socialism and the Communist Party by the rightists. Therefore, not only has it powerfully counterattacked the rightists, but it has also raised the political consciousness of the broad masses.

Now, the rightists are in an isolated position, besieged on all sides. Some have bowed their heads in confession, and some are wavering and disintegrating; some are still quibbling and perfunctory, attempting to muddle through. The broad masses of cadres in various units are currently continuing the pursuit with full confidence, expressing that they will never stop until the rightists are completely defeated.

    江西省级各机关
    右派分子四面楚歌
    新华社南昌讯　江西省省级机关中反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争正在深入展开。从6月底以来，已有一百五十多个单位、一万九千多人积极参加了这一斗争。他们一面坚持工作，一面积极参加大会、小会，写大字报、墙报，揭发和批判右派分子的反动言行和丑恶面目。
    在群众的义正辞严的指责和揭发下，右派分子已原形毕露。右派分子、“星火”杂志见习编辑罗时烽和“江西日报”文艺编辑戚志信等曾经有组织、有计划地向党进攻，污蔑党领导的文艺事业是“一团漆黑”。罗时烽提出要缩小主编的权限，取消党对文艺刊物的领导，还污蔑刊物的党员主编是“把关查验通行证的人”，咒骂社会主义制度是“没有一点人性和良心”的制度。省公路运输厅右派分子还章提出要修改宪法，要求解散全国人民代表大会、全国政协和中国共产党。这些右派分子都已经被彻底地揭发了出来。
    各机关在反击这些右派分子时，都坚持了说理斗争，用事实驳斥右派分子对社会主义和对共产党的各种污蔑。因此，不但有力地反击了右派分子，同时也提高了广大群众的政治觉悟。
    现在，右派分子已处于四面楚歌的孤立境地，有的已低头认罪，有的在动摇分化；有的还在狡赖、搪塞，企图蒙混过关。各单位的广大干部目前正满怀信心地继续进行追击，他们表示不彻底打垮右派分子决不收兵。
