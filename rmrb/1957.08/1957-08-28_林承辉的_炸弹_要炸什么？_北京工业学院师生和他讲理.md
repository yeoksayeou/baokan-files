　　What kind of "bomb" is Lin Chenghui going to detonate?
　　Teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Technology reason with him

　　(Our Newspaper) News from Beijing—Lin Chenghui, a rightist element at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said that if he were to make suggestions, he would make them like a bomb. Let's take a look at the "bomb" he set off! He slandered the Communist Party for having "grabbed all the positions, big and small, across the country." He said that for the ruling party to maintain its leading position was the "essence" of sectarianism. He viciously attacked the Party's policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." He said that the democratic parties "have no effect politically and can be abolished, leaving only the Communist Party." He denigrated China's current system of democratic centralism, saying that it "is not a panacea, it cannot cure every disease," and "what's the use of concentrating everything on one abscess?" He spread anti-Communist and anti-socialist fallacies among the students, saying that his life was "bitter" and that the school did not value old professors like him, in order to incite students to "petition" the Party committee on his behalf. He wantonly attacked the Party committee as "riding a tricycle" and unable to lead the school's teaching work, thereby opposing the Party's leadership in science and education.

　　Since 1921, Lin Chenghui had long been mixed up in the foreign affairs departments of the Northern Warlord government and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government, engaging in many anti-Communist and anti-Soviet activities. Therefore, he still cannot forget his old life and wantonly curses the new society. The teachers and students of the entire school engaged in reasoned struggle with him, and under powerful exposure and criticism, Lin Chenghui's ugly face has been fully exposed.

　　林承辉的“炸弹”要炸什么？
　　北京工业学院师生和他讲理
    本报讯　北京工业学院右派分子林承辉说，他要就是不提意见，要提就像颗炸弹。下边看看他放的
  “炸弹”吧！他污蔑共产党把“全国大大小小的岗位都抢去了”，他说执政党要保持领导地位，就是宗派主义的“实质”。他恶毒地攻击党的“长期共存，互相监督”的方针。他说民主党派在政治上“不起作用，可以取消，只留共产党”。他诋毁我国现行的民主集中制说“不是万能的东西，不是什么病都能治”，“集中到一个脓包那儿有什么办法”。他在学生中散布反共反社会主义的谬论，说什么他的生活“苦”，学校不重视他这样的老教授，以煽动学生到党委会为他“请愿”。他肆意攻击党委是“蹬三轮的”，不能领导学校教学工作，进而反对党领导科学教育工作。
    林承辉自1921年起就长期鬼混在北洋军阀政府和蒋介石反动政府的外交部门，进行过不少反共反苏的活动，所以到现在他还不能忘情他的旧生活，肆意咒骂新社会。全校师生和他进行说理斗争，在有力的揭发批判下，林承辉的丑恶面目已全部暴露。
