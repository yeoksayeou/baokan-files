The Transformation of "Great Northern Wilderness"

    Twelve Years

    Heilongjiang's industry, starting with the establishment of oil pressing and rice milling handicraft workshops in Shuangcheng and other counties in 1773, underwent 173 years of rule by the Qing Dynasty, warlords, and puppet regimes. In all that time, only seven coal mines, thirteen gold mining sites, four railway factories, two cement plants, four military factories, one cigarette factory, two sugar refineries, dozens of flour and oil processing plants, and some small iron, wood, and leather workshops were built. These enterprises were mostly equipped with outdated equipment and backward technology. The machinery industry was only capable of repair, not manufacturing. This is the epitome of industrial development in the 173 years before Liberation.

    In the twelve years since Liberation, Heilongjiang, formerly known as the "Great Northern Wilderness," has transformed into a new industrial region on China's northeastern frontier.

    Heilongjiang's industry mainly developed after the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. After 1950, twenty larger modern factories were relocated from other areas, and we also built and expanded over 170 tall factory buildings and new, grand vertical shafts... In 1949, we only had 542 state-owned and local state-owned factories, but by 1956, there were nearly a thousand factories.

    Due to the rapid development of industry, the province's total industrial output value in 1956 exceeded the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo period in 1943 by three times, while local state-owned industry exceeded it by sixteen times. The proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value rose from 45.7% in 1943 to 61.5% in 1956.

    Worlds Apart

    Before Liberation, the main industrial products were coal, electricity, sugar, paper, red bricks, cement, and the repair of passenger and freight locomotives. We had already surpassed the highest annual output of the puppet Manchukuo period in these areas during the initial stages of our construction. For example, our current coal output in 133 days is equivalent to the entire year's coal output of the puppet Manchukuo in 1942. Moreover, at that time, the production of washed and refined coal was zero, while now it is over 1.4 million tons. Products that did not exist before Liberation are now flourishing like bamboo shoots after rain. We now have motors and power station boilers; precision measuring tools, rolling bearings, and various electrical instruments; new metal cutting machine tools, combined coal mining machines, locomotives, freight cars, woodworking machinery, electric furnaces, and various animal-drawn farm implements.

    The factories and mines we have newly built are all modern, and most of the existing enterprises have also been expanded and renovated. In 1956, modern industry accounted for 77.8% of the province's total industrial output value. The output value of means of production also accounted for 67% of the total industrial output value.

    A Glorious Future

    The future development prospects of Heilongjiang's industry are broad and great.

    An electromechanical industrial zone has already been formed with Harbin as its center. In the near future, after the steam turbine and brush factories are put into production, the Harbin area will leap forward to become an important base in our country for manufacturing complete sets of power industrial equipment.

    With the completion of the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant, Qiqihar will occupy an even more prominent position in the motherland's machinery manufacturing industry.

    The coal reserves underground, the virgin forests of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, as well as iron, oil shale, quartz, and Heilongjiang's hydropower resources, will provide Heilongjiang's industry with more new industrial sectors.

    We will not only build Heilongjiang into a powerful heavy industry base, but the light industry will also have broad development prospects. It is expected that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, radios, clocks, artificial leather, artificial fibers, and nylon products will be produced in large quantities here. The original famous flax fabrics, jacquard blankets, pianos, machine-made sugar, cigarettes, canned goods, and many other products will also be greatly increased. (Image attached)

    “北大荒”的变迁
    十二年间
    黑龙江的工业，从1773年在双城等县出现了榨油、制米的手工业作坊起，经过了清王朝、军阀、敌伪一百七十三年的统治，仅仅建设了七个煤矿，十三个采金场，四个铁道工厂，二个水泥厂，四个军工厂，一个卷烟厂，二个糖厂，几十个面粉、油脂加工厂和一些铁、木、皮行业的小作坊。这些企业又大都设备陈旧、技术落后，机械工业则只能修理不能制造。这就是解放前一百七十三年工业发展的缩影。
    解放后十二年间，一直被称为北大荒的黑龙江，变成了我国东北边疆上一个新兴的工业地区。
    黑龙江工业主要是在抗美援朝战争后发展起来的。1950年以后一方面由外地迁来了二十个较大的现代化工厂；一方面我们又新建扩建了一百七十多个高大的厂房，新的规模宏伟的竖井……。1949年我们仅有国营与地方国营工厂五百四十二个，但是到了1956年就有近千个工厂了。
    由于工业的飞跃发展，1956年的全省工业总产值，比伪满最高年的1943年超过了三倍，地方国营工业则超过了十六倍，占全省工农业总产值的比重，则从1943年的45.7％上升到1956年的61.5％。
    天壤之别
    解放前的主要工业产品是煤、电、糖、纸、红砖、水泥、客货机车修理等。这些我们早在建设之初，就已超过了伪满最高年的年产量。例如，我们现在出一百三十三天的煤，就等于伪满1942年整年煤产量，而且当时洗精粉是零，现在是一百四十多万吨。解放以前没有的产品，现在都像雨后春笋般茁长出来了。这里有了电机、电站锅炉；有了精密的量刃具、滚珠轴承和各种电器仪表；有了新式金属切削机床、联合采煤机、机车、货车、木工机械、电炉以及各种马拉农具。
    我们新建的厂矿都是现代化的，大部原有企业也经过扩建、改建。1956年现代化的工业在全省工业总产值中已占77.8％。生产资料的产值也已在工业总产值中占67％。
    瑰丽的未来
    黑龙江工业的今后发展前途是广阔而伟大的。
    现在已经以哈尔滨为中心，形成了一个机电工业区；不久的将来，汽轮机、电刷等厂投入生产后，哈尔滨地区就将一跃而为我国制造全套动力工业设备的重要基地了。
    随着富拉尔基重型机器厂的建成，齐齐哈尔就将在祖国机器制造业中占居更加显要的地位。
    地下储藏的煤，大小兴安岭的处女林，以及铁、油母页岩、石英，黑龙江的水能资源，将会给黑龙江工业提供更多更新的工业部门。
    我们不仅要把黑龙江建设成为强大的重工业基地，而且轻工业也将有广阔的发展前程。预计第二个五年计划期内，这里将大批生产收音机、钟表、人造革、人造纤维、尼龙制品，原有的驰名中外的亚麻布、提花毛毯、钢琴、机制糖、卷烟、罐头等许多产品也将大大增加。（附图片）
