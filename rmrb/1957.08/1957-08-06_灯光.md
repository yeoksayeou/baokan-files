Singing the Praises of the People's Liberation Army

    Lights
　　Zhang Kunhua
　　The stars in the sky gradually faded and dwindled, and before dawn I took over the second sentry post. I vigilantly surveyed everything around me, and those two lights led me to deep thought... One is from the young mother by the village, perhaps nursing her child; the other is from the captain in the command post, ensuring peace and sound sleep in our hearts on the border... A mother has ocean-deep affection for her child. The captain loves the border as he loves his mother. Who knows how much eternal love is burned by those two lights in those nights?

    灯光
　　张昆华天边的繁星渐渐隐退雕零，黎明前我接换第二号哨岗。我警觉地巡视了周围一切，那两颗灯光引我沉思深想……一颗是寨边那位年轻母亲，也许正在给她的孩子喂乳；一颗是指挥所里的大尉，要让边境在心中平安酣睡……母亲对孩子有海样的深情。大尉像爱母亲一样爱边境。有谁知道在那些夜晚，两颗灯光燃烧了多少永恒的爱
       情？
