　　Participant in the Ding-Chen Clique, Fellow Traveler of Hu Feng's Thought
　　Feng Xuefeng is an Anti-Party Element in Literary and Art Circles
　　(Our Newspaper dispatch) An Enlarged Meeting of the Party Group of the Chinese Writers Association is continuing the struggle against the Ding Ling and Chen Qixia anti-Party clique. In addition to continuing to expose and criticize the anti-Party activities of Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, etc., the meeting further revealed that Feng Xuefeng, Vice Chairman of the Writers Association, member of the Party Group of the Writers Association, and Director of the People's Literature Publishing House, not only participated in the activities of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique, but also fanned the flames in the People's Literature Publishing House during the period of "Great Blooming and Contending," inciting those who were dissatisfied with the Party to attack the Party. The meeting also revealed a series of serious anti-Party words and deeds of Feng Xuefeng over the past twenty years.
　　Supporter and Participant of the Ding-Chen Anti-Party Clique
　　The meeting pointed out that Feng Xuefeng was a supporter and participant of the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique. In 1952, when Ding Ling was reassigned as editor-in-chief of "People's Literature," she recommended Feng Xuefeng to succeed her as editor-in-chief of "Literary Gazette," with Chen Qixia as deputy editor-in-chief. They turned "Literary Gazette" into an "independent kingdom" that resisted the leadership and supervision of the Party. In 1954, when the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Writers Association examined the errors of "Literary Gazette" in surrendering to bourgeois ideology and suppressing new forces, they criticized Feng Xuefeng's errors. Feng Xuefeng superficially made a self-criticism but harbored resentment, believing that this was a major political blow by the Party against him. He said to Chen Qixia: "They will soon be after you. You need to be careful!" He also said it was "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer."
　　When the bourgeois right-wing elements launched a large-scale attack on the Party, Feng Xuefeng conspired with Ding Ling and Chen Qixia to overturn the Party's 1955 conclusion regarding the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique. He said to Ding Ling: "Your problem will not have any results from discussions within the Party Group. It would be better if it could be taken to the masses." He also offered advice to Ding Ling, saying: "You should pretend to be sick, act as if you have been overthrown." Ding Ling indeed pretended to be persecuted at the meeting, saying: "I was beaten to death with one blow. I am a person who crawled out of the grave." Feng Xuefeng also said to Ding Ling: "You can refuse to sign the conclusion, just like Qixia." He also said: "We should still be Party members. The Communist Party will still rule the world for hundreds of years." In June of this year, when the Party Group of the Writers Association held an enlarged meeting to re-discuss the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique issue, Feng Xuefeng, as a member of the Party Group, did not attend the Party Group meeting. He said to Chen Qixia: "You hold the line at the Party Group meeting. I will not participate. I will push it away if I can, and I will delay it if I can." Chen Qixia said: "That's good. I can ask you at various meetings why you are not attending the meeting, and put them in a difficult position." Later, Chen Qixia actually did so.
　　In addition to planning behind the Party's back to establish a coterie-run journal in an attempt to undermine "Literary Gazette," Feng Xuefeng also actively participated in the Ding-Chen anti-Party clique's conspiratorial activities to split the literary and art circles. Ding Ling and Chen Qixia consulted Feng Xuefeng about their intention to publicly withdraw from the Writers Association and split the literary and art circles at the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Circles, which was scheduled to be held in October this year.
　　The "Upright Official" of the Right-Wing Elements in the People's Literature Publishing House
　　According to Wang Renshu, Xu Da, and others, during the period of "Great Blooming and Contending," when Feng Xuefeng saw the bourgeois right-wing elements launching a large-scale attack on the Party, he said excitedly: "The flood will break through the gate." He reversed his usual state of silence and depression and went to various editorial departments of the People's Literature Publishing House to start fires and launch an attack on the Party.
　　At the rectification forum, he called on those who were dissatisfied with the Party and anti-Party elements: "Report grievances and seek revenge." He also said: "The Party should be gentle and kind to those outside the Party, and those outside the Party may as well be like a violent storm to those inside the Party; superiors should be gentle and kind to subordinates, and subordinates may as well be like a violent storm to superiors."
　　He also slandered the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the People's Literature Publishing House at the mobilization meeting for the whole company as having "major errors," and said: "If necessary, there can also be violent storms. Great democracy is not a big deal." When he went to the Second Editorial Office of the company, someone asked him: "Is it okay to scold people, slap the table, and hit people during rectification?" He said: "It's okay too." At the forum of the Communist Youth League, he said: "I have always liked young people. You can say anything you want. There is nothing to be afraid of. Great democracy is not a big deal. You are not opposing socialism, you are not opposing the Communist Party, you are opposing the three evils. Even if you beat us up, it doesn't matter. For example, if a son beats his father, the father should be beaten if he is wrong."
　　He not only publicly started fires, but also personally talked with right-wing elements such as Shu Wu, Gu Xuejie, and Zhang Youluan in the company, encouraging them to attack the Party. His anti-Party and incendiary behavior earned the applause of the right-wing elements in the publishing house. The right-wing elements cheered him, calling him "Good Kuang Zhong!" and "Respects to Feng Xuefeng!" People who had problems in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries ran to Feng Xuefeng to "pour out their grievances." For a time, Feng Xuefeng became the "Upright Official Feng" of the right-wing elements in the publishing house.
　　After the anti-rightist struggle began, Feng Xuefeng confused the public by saying: "The People's Literature Publishing House only has right-wing statements and right-wing activities, but no right-wing elements." Later, although he admitted that there were right-wing elements, he attempted to protect the right-wing elements so that they could pass the test, especially emphasizing that they should "strengthen unity" with the right-wing elements, and that the anti-rightist struggle should be "gentle and kind."
　　Although Feng Xuefeng himself was the director of the People's Literature Publishing House, because he estimated that he usually did not come to the publishing house to work, and that the fires he started would not burn him, but would burn Wang Renshu, the deputy director of the publishing house who did the actual work, and the Ministry of Culture that led the publishing house, he started a fire.
　　Jiang Tianzuo and Xu Da, and others, also exposed Feng Xuefeng's abuse of private individuals with unclear political backgrounds in the publishing house, and his collusion with anti-Party elements to attack comrades loyal to the Party.
　　Consistently Anti-Party Leadership for Thirty Years
　　Many facts revealed at the meeting show that although Feng Xuefeng joined the Party thirty years ago, held important positions in the Party, participated in the Long March, and stayed in the Shangrao concentration camp, his personal relationship with the Party has always been in an incorrect position for thirty years. He always put the individual above the Party, taking himself as the center, resisting the leadership of the Party, and thus embarking on the road of opposing the Party.
　　In 1936, Feng Xuefeng went from northern Shaanxi to Shanghai. He did not trust the underground Party organization in Shanghai at that time, but once pulled Hu Feng, who was opposing the Party, into the Party. His sectarian activities in Shanghai played a divisive role in the revolutionary literary and art cause led by the Party.
　　In 1937, just as the people of the whole country rose up to resist Japan like a surging tide, and all revolutionary forces leaned towards the Party, Feng Xuefeng actually left the Party automatically and ran back to his hometown of Yiwu, Zhejiang, as a revolutionary deserter, because he disagreed with the responsible comrades of the Party. The Party Central Committee transferred him back to Yan'an, but he refused to go. After Feng Xuefeng left the Party automatically, he spent two years in his hometown without accomplishing anything. In 1939, the Party took the initiative to restore his organizational relationship and asked him to go to the New Fourth Army, but he refused to go again. The following summer, he lost his relationship with the Party once again and lived alone in the countryside. At the beginning of 1941, after the Southern Anhui Incident, the Party was worried that it would be dangerous for him to live alone in Zhejiang, and asked him to go to Guilin, but he did not accept the Party's advice and was finally arrested by the enemy and stayed in the Shangrao concentration camp for two or three years.
　　From 1944 to 1945, Feng Xuefeng showed depression and dissatisfaction with the Party in Chongqing and after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai. From 1948 to 1949, just as the whole country was approaching liberation and people were greatly encouraged, Feng Xuefeng said in a letter to Shao Quanlin: "I was originally a paving stone, but now I am kicked aside like a small pebble." At that time, the Party wanted him to go to Hong Kong, but he refused. After the liberation of the whole country, when our country was leaping forward and entering a socialist upsurge, Feng Xuefeng showed even more depression and gloom. He always felt that he was discriminated against and suppressed in the Party, that his personal power desires were not satisfied, that he had accumulated a stomach full of grievances, and that he was full of hatred for the leadership of the Party. He often scolded comrades who were doing Party work as "officials" and "revolutionary gentry," and slandered Party and state organs and even people's organizations as "yamen" to show his "detachment" and "nobility."
　　Anti-Marxist Literary and Art Thought Consistent with Hu Feng
　　The meeting revealed that Feng Xuefeng was consistent with Hu Feng's extremely reactionary literary and art thought in many basic and important issues of literature and art, and violated Marxist literary and art thought. He Qifang believes: "This is a bourgeois literary and art line, a revisionist literary and art line, hidden under the cloak of Marxism since the left-wing literary and art movement. They are trying to seize the fortress of our revolutionary literary and art movement from within."
　　Hu Feng opposed writers having a correct worldview, denied the importance of learning Marxist theory, and believed that as long as one went through "creative practice" and "wrote the truth," one could transform one's thinking and obtain a correct worldview. In 1936, Feng Xuefeng, using the pen name Lü Keyu, wrote "Opinions on Several Issues of the Literary Movement" (published in the "Writer" monthly), which also had the same point of view as Hu Feng, believing that emphasizing the correct worldview was a "mechanical old tune," reducing the study of Marxism to merely a kind of "supplement," believing that one could obtain a correct worldview from the writer's original life, or even from studying literary works and the writing process.
　　Hu Feng negated the national literary heritage, and Feng Xuefeng, like Hu Feng, negated the national form of literature and the utilization of national forms. In his article "Nationality and National Form" (see the essay collection "The Past Era"), written in 1940, he said: "The national form must and must be globalized and internationalized." He also said: "The issue of nationality has lost its independent significance in culture"; and "it is precisely in the process of being abandoned." In his "On Artistic Power and Others" (see the essay collection "Advance Without Retreat") in 1945, he said that the old forms of literature "that can be utilized effectively are very few." He only emphasized that there are "many poisonous and reactionary elements and the excessively backward aspects" in folk literature. He even regarded the utilization of old national forms as "catering to the petty bourgeoisie" and "philistinism."
　　Hu Feng used the two axes of so-called "subjective·formulaism" and "objectivism" to chop and kill the progressive literature led by the Party in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Feng Xuefeng, in his "On Artistic Power and Others," also used "formulaism" and "objectivism" to obliterate the achievements of progressive literature in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. In 1946, at a gathering of literary and art circles in Chongqing, Feng Xuefeng even publicly said that the progressive literature in the Kuomintang-controlled areas was a desert, with only a few blades of green grass, which was the "July Poetry Series" edited by Hu Feng.
　　Hu Feng despised popular works and denied the new literary works in the liberated areas. Feng Xuefeng, like Hu Feng, did not pay attention to even the most popular works in the liberated areas, thinking they were not worth reading and "too shallow." He slandered the literary achievements of the past few years after liberation, saying that these works were "almost the same as compositions in high school and junior high school." He also slandered a work produced by an old writer with the help of the Party as "literature on command." He even despised the achievements of Soviet literature, thinking that it was not as good as old Russian literature in terms of the spirit of socialist revolution.
　　Because Feng Xuefeng and Hu Feng had consistent views on many fundamental issues in literature and art, Feng Xuefeng adopted an attitude of confrontation or silence every time the Party and revolutionary writers criticized Hu Feng's reactionary literary and art thought. In 1945, some revolutionary writers in Chongqing gathered to discuss and criticize the literary and art thought of the Hu Feng faction, but Feng Xuefeng tried his best to defend Hu Feng. In the same year, at a forum of literary and art circles convened by the underground Party in Chongqing, Hu Feng opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's statement on political and artistic standards in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and the Party criticized Hu Feng. Later, Feng Xuefeng wrote "Extraneous Remarks" under the pen name "Studio" (published in the Chongqing Xinhua Daily in January 1946), publicly responding to Hu Feng and ridiculing the statement of "political nature" and "artistic nature" as not being able to withstand "three consecutive interrogations." He said, "Studying or evaluating specific works, using what abstract algebraic-style statements of 'political nature' and 'artistic nature' can be said to ruin everything." Feng Xuefeng admitted that this article was directly opposed to Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." In his "On the Literary and Art Movement of the Democratic Revolution," he tried his best to defend Hu Feng's reactionary theory. The Party criticized Hu Feng's so-called "subjective fighting spirit" as a fallacy of idealism, but Feng Xuefeng said that this was Hu Feng's "approach and pursuit of revolution," "which is very good and is precisely what our literature and art hope for," and even said that Hu Feng had no "attempt" to promote bourgeois idealism subjectively. He even absurdly said that in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in 1945, Hu Feng had no "possibility" of promoting bourgeois idealism "objectively." The Party criticized Lu Ling's novels, but Feng Xuefeng applauded Lu Ling's novels, saying, "This is precisely what we demand and precisely a great development in our literature and art in recent years."
　　In 1948, Party member writers in Hong Kong launched another criticism of Hu Feng's reactionary literary and art theory. At that time, Feng Xuefeng was in Shanghai and expressed extreme dissatisfaction. He said to Hu Feng: The criticism of Hu Feng by the Hong Kong underground Party does not represent the Party.
　　In 1955, when the Party once again criticized Hu Feng's reactionary literary and art theory nationwide, Feng Xuefeng remained silent.
　　Reactionary Social Thought
　　Feng Xuefeng's social thought is very dark and reactionary. He looks at everything with a dark psychology and a nihilistic attitude. He often described the Long March and the intra-Party struggle as gloomy and terrible in front of young people. After the Hungarian incident, he sympathized with the defection of the American writer Fast, and he even said to Chen Qixia: "There is no hope for mankind."
　　In his essays and papers, reactionary and dark thoughts are also revealed very clearly. In his "On Lu Xun" (see "The Past Era"), he said that our nation has embarked on the process of "destruction," and that the "quality" of the Chinese people has become very "morbid." A former imperialist element—an American missionary—slandered the bad characteristics of the Chinese people as having more than twenty kinds, and he even believed that this was "still superficial" and "not the most profound observation." In "Waste and Mold" (see "Advance Without Retreat"), he even attributed the traitorous surrender of the great traitor Wang Jingwei to the Chinese people.
　　In "On Friendship" (see "Advance Without Retreat"), he advocated putting personal "friendship" above the interests of the collective and the class, and even openly created a "theory" for speaking for shameless traitors. He believed that a friend "has a rebellious or destructive attempt against the nation or society, or the class or the group to which they belong," and if they are not first advised and stopped but reported to the society and the group, it is "malicious" to friends or comrades, and "the seemingly faithful loyalty to society or group is often suspicious." In "Fire Hell" (see "Advance Without Retreat"), he praised the reports of British and American news agencies that slandered the Soviet Red Army's capture of Berlin, saying that it was "epic-like writing." The Soviet army's capture of Berlin was the destruction of fascist aggressors and a joyous event for all mankind, but Feng Xuefeng said: "The Soviet Red Army entered Berlin, and Berlin immediately became a city of fire, becoming the 'city of terror' for mankind." He also said: "After the carnival, we may still have to endure the unbearable, desolate, and茫然 pain." From this, we can see how reactionary and dark Feng Xuefeng's thoughts are. The people who attended the meeting stood up and questioned Feng Xuefeng, asking why he had such extremely reactionary thoughts.
　　The meeting pointed out that Feng Xuefeng's anti-Marxist literary and art thought and reactionary social thought are the ideological basis for Feng Xuefeng's anti-Party behavior.
　　The meeting has been held nineteen times from June 6 to August 20, and more than 100 people have spoken at the meeting. After the twelfth meeting, Xu Guangping, Lao She, Qian Junrui, Xia Yan, Zheng Zhenduo, Cai Chusheng, Shao Quanlin, Zhang Tianyi, He Qifang, Zhou Libo, Zhao Shuli, Wang Renshu, Yuan Shuibai, Ge Qin (17 people jointly spoke), Feng Zhi (and Wu Zuxiang, Bian Zhilin jointly spoke), Chen Baichen, Zhang Guangnian, Sun Weishi, Zang Kejia, Yan Wenjing, Jiang Tianzuo, Sha Ting, Lou Shiyi, Ruan Zhangjing, Li Bozhao, Han Zi, Wang Shijing, Wang Meng and others continued to speak at the meeting. Ding Ling made a total of five speeches at the meeting, and her attitude was extremely dishonest. At the meeting, everyone felt indignant at her attitude. Everyone was also extremely dissatisfied with Feng Xuefeng's evasive and hesitant account at the eighteenth meeting. The meeting is still in progress.

### 丁陈集团参加者　胡风思想同路人　冯雪峰是文艺界反党分子

　　丁陈集团参加者　胡风思想同路人
　　冯雪峰是文艺界反党分子
    本报讯　中国作家协会党组扩大会议，正在继续进行反对丁玲、陈企霞反党集团的斗争。会议除继续揭发和批判丁玲、陈企霞等的反党活动外，进一步揭露出作协副主席、作协党组成员、人民文学出版社社长冯雪峰，不但参加了丁、陈反党集团的活动；而且在大鸣大放期间，在人民文学出版社煽风点火，鼓动对党不满的分子向党进攻。会上还揭露了冯雪峰二十多年来一系列严重的反党言行。
　　丁、陈反党集团的支持者和参与者
    会上指出，冯雪峰是丁、陈反党集团的支持者和参与者。1952年丁玲改任“人民文学”主编，她推荐冯雪峰接替她作了“文艺报”的主编，陈企霞作副主编。他们把
  “文艺报”变成了抗拒党的领导和监督的“独立王国”。1954年，中共中央宣传部、全国文联和中国作家协会对“文艺报”向资产阶级思想投降、压制新生力量的错误进行检查时，批评了冯雪峰的错误，冯雪峰阳奉阴违地做了检讨，但是心怀不满，认为这是党对他在政治上的一次大打击。他对陈企霞说：“很快人家就要整你了，你要当心点！”又说这是“城门失火，殃及池鱼”。
    资产阶级右派分子向党大举进攻的时候，冯雪峰和丁玲、陈企霞密谋推翻1955年党关于丁、陈反党集团所做的结论。他对丁玲说：“你的问题在党组讨论不会有什么结果，要是能拿到群众里去，那就好些。”又向丁玲献策说：“你吗，最好装病，就作出一副给人打倒了的样子。”丁玲果然在会上装出是受迫害的样子说：“我是一棍子被打死了的，是从坟墓里爬出来的人。”冯雪峰还对丁玲说：“你可以像企霞那样，拒绝在结论上签字。”又说：“党员还是要做的，共产党还要统治世界几百年。”今年六月，作家协会党组召开扩大会议，重新讨论丁、陈反党集团问题时，冯雪峰作为党组成员，却不参加党组会。他对陈企霞说：“党组会你顶住，我不参加，我能推就推，能拖就拖。”陈企霞说：“这很好，我可以在各种会上问你为什么不参加会，将他们的军。”以后陈企霞果然这样做了。
    冯雪峰除了背着党筹划办同人刊物，企图搞垮“文艺报”外，还积极地参加了丁、陈反党集团分裂文艺界的阴谋活动。丁玲和陈企霞要在今年10月准备举行的第三次全国文艺界代表大会上，公开退出作家协会分裂文艺界的事，是征求过冯雪峰的意见的。
　　人民文学出版社右派分子的“青天”
    据王任叔、徐达等揭发：在大鸣大放期间，冯雪峰看到资产阶级右派分子大举向党进攻的时候，他兴奋地说：“洪水将冲破大门。”他一反平常的沉默、抑郁的状态，在人民文学出版社的各编辑部门到处放火，向党发动进攻。
    在整风座谈会上，他号召对党不满和反党的分子：“有冤报冤，有仇报仇”。又说：“党内对党外应和风细雨，党外对党内暴风骤雨也不妨；上级对下级应和风细雨，下级对上级暴风骤雨也未尝不可。”
    他还在全社的整风动员大会上污蔑人民文学出版社的肃反工作有
  “重大错误”，并说：“必要时也可暴风骤雨，大民主也不要紧。”他到该社第二编辑室，有人问他：“整风中骂人、拍桌子、打人可不可以？”他说：“也可以。”在共青团的座谈会上，他说：“我向来是喜欢青年的，你们有什么尽管说，没有什么可怕，大民主也不妨。你们不是造社会主义的反，不是造共产党的反，反的是三害嘛，你们就是打我们一顿也不算什么。比如儿子打老子，老子不对就该打。”
    他不但公开放火，而且还亲自和该社的舒芜、顾学颉、张友鸾等右派分子交谈，鼓动他们向党进攻。他的这种反党放火的行为，博得了出版社右派分子的喝采。右派分子向他欢呼：“好况锺”呀！“向冯雪峰致敬”呀！肃反中有问题的人跑去向冯雪峰“诉苦”。一时，冯雪峰在出版社变成右派分子的“冯青天”了。
    反右派斗争开始后，冯雪峰混淆视听地说：“人民文学出版社只有右派言论和右派活动，但没有右派分子”。以后他虽然承认了有右派分子，但又企图保护右派分子过关，特别强调和右派分子要“加强团结”，反右派斗争要“和风细雨”。
    冯雪峰虽然自己是人民文学出版社的社长，但因为他估计到他平时不来出版社办公，放起火来烧不到他，要烧的是出版社作实际工作的副社长王任叔，和领导出版社的文化部，所以他就放起火来。
    蒋天佐和徐达等，并揭发了冯雪峰在出版社滥用政治面目不清的私人，和反党分子勾结在一起，打击忠实于党的同志。
　　三十年来一贯反党的领导
    会上揭露的许多事实说明：冯雪峰虽然入党三十年，在党内担任过重要的工作，参加过长征，住过上饶集中营，但三十年来，他个人和党的关系，一直摆在不正确的位置上。他始终把个人放在党的上面，以自我为中心，对抗党的领导，从而走上了反党的道路。
    1936年，冯雪峰从陕北到上海。他不信任当时上海的地下党组织，却把正在反对党的胡风一度拉入党内。他在上海的宗派活动，对党所领导的革命文艺事业起了分裂作用。
    1937年，正是全国人民风起云涌地起来抗日，全国一切革命力量向党靠拢的时候，冯雪峰却竟因为和党的负责同志意见不合，便自动离开了党，跑回浙江义乌老家去，作了革命逃兵。党中央调他回延安，他拒绝不去。冯雪峰自动脱党以后，在家乡混了二年，一事无成。1939年，党主动给他恢复了组织关系，要他去新四军，他又不去。次年夏天，他又一次失去了党的关系，一个人住在乡下。1941年初，皖南事变发生后，党担心他一个人住在浙江危险，要他到桂林去，他却不接受党的劝告，终于被敌人逮捕，在上饶集中营住了两三年。
    1944年至1945年，冯雪峰在重庆，抗战胜利后到上海，都表现消沉和对党不满。1948年至1949年，正当全国接近解放、人心大振奋的时候，冯雪峰给邵荃麟的信中却说：“我本来是铺路的石块，现在像块小石子似的被踢在一旁。”当时党要他去香港，他拒绝了。全国解放后，我们的国家正在飞跃前进，进入社会主义高潮时，冯雪峰表现的更加消沉、阴暗。他总认为他在党内是受歧视、受压制的，个人的权力欲望没有得到满足，积存了一肚子的怨气，对党的领导充满了仇恨，经常骂作党的工作的同志是“做官”的，是“革命绅士”，污蔑党和国家机关，甚至人民团体都是“衙门”，以示自己“超然”、“清高”。
　　反马克思主义的文艺思想和胡风一致
    会议揭露：冯雪峰在文艺的许多基本问题和重要问题上，是和胡风的极端反动的文艺思想相一致，而和马克思主义的文艺思想相违背的。何其芳认为：“这是左翼文艺运动以来一条隐蔽在马克思主义的外衣之下的资产阶级的文艺路线、修正主义的文艺路线。他们是企图从内部来夺取我们的革命文艺运动的堡垒的。”
    胡风反对作家应具有正确的世界观，否认学习马克思主义理论的重要，认为只要通过“创作实践”“写真实”等，就可以改造思想和获得正确的世界观。1936年，冯雪峰用吕克玉笔名写的“对于文学运动几个问题的意见”（发表在“作家”月刊上）一文中，也和胡风的论点相同，认为强调正确的世界观就是“机械论的老调”，把学习马克思主义降低为仅仅是一种“补助”，认为从作家的本来生活、甚至从研究文学作品和写作过程中，就可以获得正确的世界观。
    胡风否定民族文学遗产，冯雪峰也和胡风一样，否定文学的民族形式，否定对民族形式的利用。1940年，在他写的“民族性与民族形式”（见论文集“过来的时代”）一文中，他说：“民族形式必然而且必须在世界化着、国际化着。”又说：“民族性问题在文化上是失去了独立的意义的”；而且“正是处在被扬弃的过程上”。1945年，在他的“论艺术力及其他”（见论文集“有进无退”）中说，文学的旧有形式“可利用的有效的是非常的少”，他只强调民间文艺里“有很多有毒的反动的要素和过于落后的东西的一面”，他甚至把利用民族旧有形式看成是“迎合小市民”的“市侩主义”。
    胡风用所谓“主观·公式主义”和“客观主义”两把板斧砍杀国民党统治区党所领导的进步文艺，冯雪峰在他的“论艺术力及其他”一文中，也用“公式主义”和“客观主义”抹煞国民党统治区进步文艺的成就。1946年，在重庆文艺界的一次集会上，冯雪峰还公开说：国民党统治区的进步文艺是一片沙漠，其中只有几根绿草，那就是胡风主编的“七月诗丛”。
    胡风轻视普及的作品，否认解放区的新文学作品，冯雪峰也和胡风一样，连最为群众欢迎的解放区作品，他都不放在眼里，认为不值一读和“太浅”。他污蔑解放后几年来的文学成就，说这些作品“与高中、初中的作文差不多。”并污蔑一位老作家在党的帮助下产生的作品，是“奉命文学”。他甚至轻视苏联文学的成就，认为在社会主义革命精神上还不如旧俄文学。
    因为冯雪峰和胡风在文艺上许多根本问题的看法相一致，所以党和革命作家对胡风的反动文艺思想几次提出批判的时候，冯雪峰都采取对抗或缄默的态度。1945年，重庆的部分革命作家集会讨论和批判胡风派的文艺思想，冯雪峰却极力为胡风辩护。同年，重庆的地下党召开的文艺界座谈会上，胡风反对毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中关于政治标准和艺术标准的提法，党对胡风进行了批评。后来，冯雪峰以“画室”的笔名写“题外的话”（发表于1946年1月重庆的新华日报上），公开响应胡风，讥笑“政治性”、“艺术性”的说法经不起“一连反问三次”。他说，“研究或评价具体作品，用什么抽象的‘政治性’、‘艺术性’的代数学式的说法，可说是什么都弄糟了。”冯雪峰承认这篇文章是正面反对毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的。在他的“论民主革命的文艺运动”一书中，他极力为胡风的反动理论辩护。党批评胡风的所谓“主观战斗精神”是唯心主义的谬论，冯雪峰却说这是胡风对“革命的接近和追求”，“反映到文艺和文艺运动上来是非常好的，也正是为我们文艺所希望的，”甚至说胡风在主观上没有宣传资产阶级唯心主义的“企图”，他甚至荒谬地说，在1945年的国民党统治区，胡风“客观”上也没有宣传资产阶级唯心主义的“可能”。党批评路翎的小说，冯雪峰却为路翎的小说喝采，说“这正是我们所要求、并且也正是几年来我们文艺上的一个大展开。”
    1948年，在香港的党员作家，又对胡风的反动文艺理论展开了一次批判。当时冯雪峰在上海，表示极为不满，他对胡风说：香港地下党对胡风的批判不是代表党的。
  1955年，党对胡风的反动文艺理论，再一次在全国范围里进行批判的时候，冯雪峰始终保持缄默。
　　反动的社会思想
    冯雪峰的社会思想是非常阴暗和反动的。他怀着阴暗的心理和虚无主义的态度去看待一切。他常在青年人面前把长征和党内斗争，描绘得阴森可怕。在匈牙利事件发生 后，他同情美国作家法斯特的叛党行为，他甚至对陈企霞说：“人类没有希望。”
    在他的杂文和论文中，反动的阴暗的思想表现的也很露骨。在他的“鲁迅论”（见“过来的时代”）中，他说我们的民族已走上了“灭亡”的过程，说中国人民的“素质”已经变得十分“病态”。从前一个帝国主义分子——美国传教士，污蔑中国人民坏的特性有二十多种，他甚至认为这“还是表面的”，还“不是最深刻的观察”。在“废与霉”（见“有进无退”）里，他甚至把大汉奸汪精卫的叛国投敌也归咎于中国人民。
    在“论友爱”（见“有进无退”）中，他提倡把私人的“友情”摆在集体和阶级的利益之上，甚至公开制造为无耻的叛徒说话的“理论”。他认为一个朋友“对于民族或社会、或阶级或他们所属的集团有叛逆或破坏的企图”，如果不先劝告、阻止而向社会和集团告发，这对于朋友或同志都是“居心险恶”的，“对社会或团体的形似的忠实，也常是可疑的”。在“火狱”（见“有进无退”）中，他赞扬英美通讯社污蔑苏联红军攻克柏林的报道，说那是“史诗似的文字”。苏军攻克柏林，是法西斯侵略者的毁灭，是全人类欢欣鼓舞的事情，但是冯雪峰却说：“苏联红军攻进了柏林，柏林立即全城大火，成为人类的‘恐怖之城’。”还说：“在狂欢之后，也许还要忍受不能忍受的索漠的茫然的痛苦。”从此可以看到，冯雪峰的思想，反动和阴暗到什么程度。到会的人纷纷起来质问冯雪峰，究竟为什么原故他会有这样极端反动的思想。
    会议指出：冯雪峰的这种反马克思主义的文艺思想和反动的社会思想，正是冯雪峰反党行为的思想基础。
    会议从6月6日起，到8月20日止，已先后举行了十九次，在会上发言的共百余人。第十二次会议后，在会上继续发言的有许广平、老舍、钱俊瑞、夏衍、郑振铎、蔡楚生、邵荃麟、张天翼、何其芳、周立波、赵树理、王任叔、袁水拍、葛琴（十七人联合发言）、冯至（和吴组缃、卞之琳联合发言）、陈白尘、张光年、孙维世、臧克家、严文井、蒋天佐、沙汀、楼适夷、阮章竞、李伯钊、菡子、王士菁、王蒙等。丁玲在会上先后共作了五次发言，态度极不老实。会上，大家一致对她的这种态度感到愤慨。大家对冯雪峰在第十八次会上避重就轻、吞吞吐吐的交代也极为不满。会议仍在继续进行。
