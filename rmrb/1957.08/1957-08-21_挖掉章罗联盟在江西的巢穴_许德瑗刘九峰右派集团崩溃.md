Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Special Dispatch: The anti-Rightist struggle in Jiangxi Province's democratic parties is deepening. The reactionary activities of Xu Deyuan, chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Liu Jiufeng, vice chairman, and others have been preliminarily exposed. According to the materials that have been revealed, they are the behind-the-scenes commanders of a rightist clique in Jiangxi Province. In May of this year, people from this group went to Ji'an, Jingdezhen, Pingxiang and other places to incite League members in grassroots organizations to oppose the Communist Party. Xu and Liu personally went to Ji'an City to hold a meeting of China Democratic League members, inciting them to summon up the courage to attack the Party. During the Jiangxi Provincial China Democratic League Representative Conference in July last year, Xu Deyuan promoted to representatives from various regions the idea of vigorously developing League membership. At the Third Plenary Session of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League this year, Liu Jiufeng proposed "actively developing membership in rural areas as well." Xu Deyuan, in his capacity as Director of the Provincial Department of Education, publicly stated: "From the Central Committee to the Provincial Party Committee, no one understands how to run education." He also said that the Party's policy towards intellectuals was "cruel struggle and merciless blows," and that "the Communist Party's bureaucracy is more dangerous than the Kuomintang." Liu Jiufeng also spread the word everywhere that the system of Party committees in universities and institutions should be abolished.

    Among the leading members of the democratic parties in Jiangxi Province, the rightists who have been exposed also include Qi Yuyuan (Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League), Xiang De'an (Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League), Wang Qiuxin (Chairman of the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League), Liao Chaolun (Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), Xiong Keli (Director of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), and Yu Ti (Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party). The rightist Qi Yuyuan actively cultivated his own forces in the cultural and educational circles of Jiangxi, organized an anti-Party group, and colluded with the Xu-Liu anti-Party group. Qi was the Deputy Director of the Provincial Cultural Bureau. When the bureau discussed major issues and sought his opinion, he didn't actively offer suggestions, but afterwards said that he was: "Having a title but no power." He carried a small notebook with him, collecting materials from people who were dissatisfied with the Party as "ammunition" to attack the Party. He said: "If we are going to fight, we must fight Shao Shiping, the number one target" (Shao Shiping is the Secretary of the Secretariat of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China; Governor of Jiangxi Province). Now, some of these rightists have bowed their heads and confessed their guilt, while others are still stubbornly resisting. Their exposure and criticism are underway.

    According to this newspaper: Li Zhu, Secretary-General of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, published an article in the "Jiangxi Daily" on the 13th, exposing the criminal activities of the anti-Communist alliance formed by the rightists in the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, headed by Xu Deyuan, chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Liu Jiufeng, vice chairman, and Qi Yuyuan, including Xiang Fayi, Wang Qiuxin, Yao Bo, Liu Yiyan, He Xingnan, Xu Jiefu, Fu Tiaohuan, and others, to attack the Communist Party.

    The article stated that Xu Deyuan, Liu Jiufeng, Qi Yuyuan, and others formed an alliance to conspire to control the Jiangxi Provincial China Democratic League organization and "divide the court and contend" with the Communist Party. In 1956, when the Jiangxi Provincial China Democratic League organization held its third representative conference, Xu Deyuan threatened "decapitation" to ensure that Liu Jiufeng was elected as the Deputy Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League. Later, they promoted their loyal follower Xiang Fayi to Secretary-General. Wang Qiuxin also participated in their group. They also cultivated a group of backbone members in some municipal and university-level grassroots organizations of the China Democratic League. In addition to the small group headed by Xu and Liu, there was also a small group headed by Qi Yuyuan. The main backbone members of this group were Yao Bo, LÃ¼ Xiaowei, Liao Qingyun, and others.

    The article cited many facts to show that Xu, Liu, Qi and others were the specific executors of the political line of the Zhang-Luo alliance in Jiangxi. The article stated that Xu Deyuan joined the China Democratic League on the recommendation of Luo Longji and Peng Wenyin, and they had always been very close. As early as 1949, Liu Jiufeng attended a meeting convened by Luo Longji in Shanghai, at which Luo Longji blatantly stated that "the Jiangxi China Democratic League should be controlled by me." Liu Jiufeng's return to Jiangxi was also introduced by Luo Longji, and Luo designated that he must participate in the leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial China Democratic League. In 1953, Luo Longji went to Lushan and held a meeting with Ma Zhemin, Xu Deyuan, and Liu Jiufeng. According to Xu Deyuan and Liu Jiufeng, they had planned at that meeting to establish a "Central South Executive Department of the China Democratic League" headed by Ma Zhemin. During the National Propaganda and Education Conference in April of this year, Xu Deyuan and Qi Yuyuan jointly accepted instructions from Zhang Bojun, and after returning to Jiangxi, they promoted the "two-house system" everywhere, and even wanted to organize a "China Democratic League Party Group" in the CPPCC.

    The article stated that during the period of blooming and contending, Xu, Liu, Qi, and others frantically attacked the Communist Party and socialism. Xu Deyuan falsely accused the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China of not having anyone who understood education except for Shao Shiping, who had some knowledge of it. Xu also echoed Zhang Bojun's clamor to "abolish the school Party committee system." Liu Jiufeng and Qi Yuyuan (Deputy Director of the Provincial Cultural Bureau) shouted in response everywhere. They also unanimously attacked the Communist Party's policy of unified purchase and sale, slandered the Communist Party's grassroots cadres, and Xiang Fayi openly proposed to replace the Communist Party's grassroots cadres with cadres from democratic parties, advocating "dividing the court and contending" with the Party.

    Xu Deyuan cursed that "the Communist Party is taking credit for the work of heaven."

    Xu Deyuan, Liu Jiufeng, and Qi Yuyuan also advocated large-scale development in the cultural and educational circles, and development should also take place in the counties. Xu Deyuan and Liu Jiufeng had also gone to Ji'an (and were planning to go to Ganzhou) to stir up "fire."

    The article revealed that Xu, Liu, Qi, and others had always held a hostile attitude towards the Communist Party and the socialist cause. Xu Deyuan's fourth uncle was a local tyrant and landlord who was struggled against during the land reform and later died. Xu Deyuan said to Xu Jiefu with infinite resentment: "The issue of the fourth uncle will be settled in the future." In 1952, one of Xu Deyuan's nephews committed suicide out of fear of punishment in the Three-Anti Campaign, and he used his nephew's wife's name to write a complaint against the leaders of Jiujiang County. During the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries Campaign, Xu Deyuan clamored that it was "excessive" and "wronged good people," and personally pleaded for Lai Weiying, the head of the puppet security office who had committed numerous bloody crimes. During the land reform period, Liu Jiufeng also frequently spread absurd remarks such as "there are also good and honest landlords." Regarding the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries Movement, Liu Jiufeng clamored that "many people were wrongly killed" and falsely accused the cadres of the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries work of "not doing their jobs properly." During the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries Movement, Qi Yuyuan prevented the targets of the suppression from confessing, and during this period of blooming and contending, he personally visited the targets of the suppression in an attempt to overturn their cases.

    The article also revealed the ugly history of Xu, Liu, Qi, and others. As early as the Great Revolution of 1927, Xu Deyuan was a rightist of the Kuomintang at that time, and was one of the five members of the preparatory committee of the Jiujiang County Kuomintang Party Department organized by Duan Xipeng. Liu Jiufeng had once turned to the Kuomintang and served as a civilian affairs planning specialist in the Jiangxi Provincial Party Department of the Kuomintang. The formation of this alliance has caused great damage to the Jiangxi Provincial China Democratic League organization, both politically and organizationally. Politically, their conspiracy to peddle the political line of the Zhang-Luo alliance has caused serious confusion within the Jiangxi Provincial China Democratic League organization. Organizationally, the pawns they have cultivated have already seized leadership of a considerable part of the Jiangxi Provincial China Democratic League organization. In order to uphold the socialist line, and in order to make the China Democratic League truly a socialist party that wholeheartedly accepts the leadership of the Communist Party, this anti-Communist alliance must be completely crushed.
