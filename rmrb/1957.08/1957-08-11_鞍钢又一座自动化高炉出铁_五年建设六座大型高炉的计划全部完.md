    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 10th: The sixth automated blast furnace built by Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been completed, and the first heat of iron was tapped at 10:25 this morning. With this, all six large blast furnaces planned to be built in Anshan under the state's first Five-Year Plan have been completed.
    Today marks the conclusion of a phase in Anshan's iron smelting industrial construction, and the workers gathered on the platform of the newly completed blast furnace were particularly excited. As soon as the molten iron flowed out, labor model Meng Tai couldn't help but exclaim loudly to everyone, "This iron tapping is unprecedentedly smooth!" Dong Qiming, the deputy captain of the furnace construction team, who came from an old worker background, also made a special trip to the iron smelting plant today. He took a look at all the blast furnaces that he participated in restoring and rebuilding. He happily told reporters, "The construction tasks assigned to us by the state have been completed. After I take one last look at them, I will go to a new construction site."
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company now has nine large blast furnaces. Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report on the first Five-Year Plan: After the reconstruction of Anshan Iron and Steel in 1960 is completed, its production scale can be expanded to an annual output of 2.5 million tons of pig iron. Now this amount of iron production has long been surpassed.
    During the construction of these six automated blast furnaces, the Chinese working class basically learned the entire set of skills for the design, equipment manufacturing, and construction of large blast furnaces from Soviet experts.

    鞍钢又一座自动化高炉出铁
    五年建设六座大型高炉的计划全部完成
    新华社鞍山10日电　鞍山钢铁公司建设的第六座自动化高炉已经建成，今天上午十点二十五分出了头一炉铁水。至此，国家第一个五年计划规定在鞍山建设的六座大型高炉，全部完成了。
    今天，是鞍山炼铁工业基本建设告一段落的日子，聚集在新建成的高炉炉台上的职工们特别兴奋。铁水刚刚流出，劳动模范孟泰就情不自禁地高声对大家说：“这次出铁是空前的顺利！”老工人出身的筑炉工程队副队长董启明，今天也特地赶来炼铁厂，看了一遍在他参加下恢复改建的全部高炉，他愉快地对记者说：“国家交给我们的建设任务完成了，我最后看它们一遍后，就要走上新建设工地。”
    鞍山钢铁公司现在已经拥有九座大型高炉。李富春副总理在关于第一个五年计划的报告中说：鞍钢1960年改建完成以后，它的生产规模可以扩大到年产生铁二百五十万吨，现在这个产铁量早已经被突破了。
    在这六座自动化高炉的建设过程中，我国工人阶级从苏联专家那里基本上学会了大型高炉的设计、设备制造和施工的整套本领。
