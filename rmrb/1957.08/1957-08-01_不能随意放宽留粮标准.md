    The Food Grain Standard Should Not Be Relaxed Arbitrarily
    Practice over the past few years has proven that our country's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain is entirely correct. It has guaranteed the completion of national planned tasks and stimulated the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. The broad masses of farmers actively support the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain.
    However, in the first half of this year, some rural work cadres (including some leading cadres) in Yuhuan County developed a right-leaning sentiment on the grain issue. First, some county committee cadres in charge believed that it was not good to act according to the "Three Fixes" policy. They generally did not dare to promote the "Three Fixes" policy, as if they had offended people in the grain work last year. Many cadres one-sidedly sympathized with the people's complaints and relaxed the amount of grain retained for personal use.
    Since 1954, our county has stipulated that the amount of early rice retained is 130 jin per person in the plains area, but this year it is stipulated that the average amount of grain retained per person is 160 to 170 jin. In the specific implementation, it has been relaxed to 180 to 190 jin. In the past, the amount of grain purchased in Yuhuan County from the early rice to the late rice season could supply the county, but this year a large amount needs to be transferred from other places, and the amount transferred is estimated to account for 20% of the supply during this period. In this way, the bad elements and some wealthy farmers in the countryside are even more rampant in shouting that the unified purchase and sale of grain is not good. They attempt to overthrow the "Three Fixes" policy on grain, create rumors everywhere, and seriously affect the national grain purchase work.
    At present, when the whole Party is carrying out rectification, I think it is necessary to vigorously criticize the right-leaning ideology in rural work, otherwise the grain work in our county will be in an even more passive situation.　Jin Chengxing

    不能随意放宽留粮标准
    这几年的实践证明，我国的粮食统购统销政策是完全正确的。它保证了国家计划任务的完成，也刺激了广大农民的生产积极性。广大农民群众是积极拥护粮食统购统销政策的。
    但是，今年上半年玉环县有一些农村工作干部（包括一些领导干部）在粮食问题上却产生了一种右倾的情绪——首先是有些县委负责干部认为按“三定”政策办事不好，他们普遍不敢宣传“三定”政策，好像去年在粮食工作上得罪了人一样。不少干部片面地同情群众叫苦，放宽自用粮留量。
    1954年以来，我县规定早稻留量平原地区每人一百三十斤，而今年却规定每人平均留粮一百六十至一百七十斤，在具体执行的时候，还有放宽到一百八十斤到一百九十斤的。玉环县历年来早稻到晚稻期间，收购起来的粮食都能供应本县，而今年却要大批地从外地调入，调入量估计要占这段时间供应量的20％。这样，农村中的坏分子和部分富裕农民叫喊粮食统购统销不好的就更加猖狂了，他们企图推翻粮食“三定”政策，到处造谣生事，严重影响了国家粮食征购工作。
    目前正值全党整风的时候，我认为必须大力批判在农村工作中的右倾思想，否则我们这县的粮食工作会更加陷于被动局面。　金成行
