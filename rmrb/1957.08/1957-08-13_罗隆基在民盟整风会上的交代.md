Luo Longji's Confession at the Rectification Meeting of the China Democratic League

(Our newspaper reports) Luo Longji made some confessions on the 12th at the seventh expanded rectification symposium of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League regarding his consistent reactionary activities. A summary is reported below:

Thorough Anti-Communist and Anti-Sovietism

In his self-criticism, Luo Longji admitted his consistent criminal activities that started thirty years ago. However, his self-criticism focused on historical facts before liberation, and he confessed very little about his reactionary words and deeds after liberation.

Luo Longji first talked about his activities from when he returned from abroad in 1928 to when he left Shanghai in 1932 to work as the chief writer for the Tianjin Yi Shi Bao in Tianjin. He said that during this period, he was thoroughly anti-Soviet and anti-communist. After returning to Shanghai, Hu Shi, Xu Zhimo, Liang Shiqiu, and others recruited him into the "New Moon" magazine, and soon he became the editor-in-chief of New Moon. He began to write political articles for this magazine. At that time, his political ideology was thoroughly anti-Soviet and anti-communist. He was a student of Professor Laski in England, who was a reactionary political scholar who was anti-Soviet and anti-communist, and he had a set of anti-Soviet and anti-communist theories. He peddled Laski's set of decadent theories widely in New Moon. He published a long article in New Moon titled "On Communism," which was an article that opposed communism theoretically. Looking at this article today, its absurdity far exceeds his other reactionary articles. Twenty-eight or twenty-nine years ago, he spread many anti-communist toxins to intellectuals and young people at the time.

1927 was the great anniversary of the founding of the army by the Nanchang Uprising Liberation Army. At that time, the Chinese people's revolution led by the Communist Party had just begun. Chiang Kai-shek used force to carry out the so-called "suppression of communists." He published articles in New Moon, arguing that communism could not be resolved by force and that it was necessary to attack it ideologically. He peddled Laski's set of ideas, acting as a pioneer in the ideological anti-communism in China, cooperating with Chiang's military suppression of communists. What a great crime this was.

Luo Longji also said that twenty-eight years ago, he was not only ideologically anti-communist, but his political activities were also anti-communist. After returning to China, he met Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun, the leaders of the National Socialist Party, and Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, and Li Huang, the leaders of the Youth Party, in Shanghai. He and this group of people shared the same views at the time and became political friends. Everyone knows that these two parties were resolutely anti-Soviet and anti-communist. He soon joined the National Socialist Party. The Youth Party and the National Socialist Party were two so-called opposition parties that cooperated closely at the time. In fact, they both had relations with the Chiang Kai-shek regime. In particular, the Youth Party openly participated in Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist war. During the Long March, when the Red Army passed through Sichuan, Li Huang of the Youth Party mobilized all the Youth Party members in Sichuan to help "suppress the communists." In political action, he participated in Zhang Junmai's National Socialist Party, and in political thought, he worked for the New Moon magazine edited by Hu Shi. This was his ugly history when he first returned to China.

Luo Longji then talked about his activities from 1932 to 1937. During this period, he was always the chief writer of Yi Shi Bao. Luo Longji said, why did Yi Shi Bao invite him to be the chief writer? Yi Shi Bao was a Catholic newspaper, and he was not a Catholic. The main reason was that he had a set of decadent anti-communist theories. During this period, the "September 18th" Incident of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China occurred. Luo Longji said that his political thought during this period was still anti-communist and anti-Soviet, but he also said that he advocated "uniting with the communists to resist Japan" on the issue of resisting Japan. He said that Chiang Kai-shek at that time still wanted to surrender to Japan, and his policy was: "Settle internal affairs before resisting foreign aggression," and also said "To resist foreign aggression, one must first settle internal affairs." He said that Hu Shi supported this policy. And he advocated "guns pointed outward," "resist foreign aggression before settling internal affairs." Luo Longji then said: Of course, I must specifically state that my thinking was still anti-communist and anti-Soviet, just from the sentence "resist foreign aggression before settling internal affairs," it is clear. What is "settling internal affairs"? Isn't it the meaning of Chiang Kai-shek settling internal affairs? I was advising him to carry out anti-communism after the victory against Japan.

Luo Longji admitted that he was a double-dealer during this period. On the one hand, he contacted progressive people, and on the other hand, he colluded with reactionary forces such as the National Socialist Party and the Youth Party.

The Pro-American Third Road

Luo Longji then talked about his activities from 1937 to 1949 during the liberation period. He said that this period was when he insisted on the middle road. He said that the reason why the War of Resistance Against Japan could be launched, persisted in, and finally won was because of the strength of the Communist Party, and the strength of the Communist Party leading the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. In 1941, many parties other than the Communist Party and the Kuomintang organized the China Democratic Political League in Chongqing. He was one of the initiators. The motive for organizing the Democratic Political League was to create a third force outside the Communist Party and the Kuomintang to implement the third road. He participated in drafting the program of the Democratic Political League and drafting the political reports of several congresses, all of which clearly expressed the intention to adopt Anglo-American democracy and take the third road. What do the two sentences "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics" mean? Nationalization of the army meant that the Red Army should stop armed revolution. Democratization of politics was Anglo-American democracy. Luo Longji talked about his political tendency in the Democratic Political League, saying that the Youth Party and the National Socialist Party supported Chiang, and the leftists and progressives supported the Communist Party. He left the National Socialist Party in 1941. He always insisted on the middle road. At that time, he still wanted to build the Democratic League into China's third major political party. At that time, he still had the idea that Chinese political parties must have military force. He placed the foundation of the Democratic League in southwestern China, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces. At that time, the three powerful military men in Sichuan, Deng Xihou, Pan Wenhua, and Liu Wenhui, were students and friends of Zhang Lan, the chairman of the Democratic League, and Chairman Zhang had an influence on them. Mr. Li Renchao was in Guangxi, and he had an influence on the military men in Guangdong and Guangxi. He taught at the Southwest Associated University in Yunnan, and through the relationship with Miao Yuntai, he made some contacts with Long Yun, the chairman of Yunnan at the time. Miao Yuntai was a bureaucratic capitalist, a student returning from the United States, and his thinking was the same as his. He was anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and took the American road. He is still in the United States now. At that time, his ideas and the ideas of the local military men in the southwest were not one-sided towards the Communist Party, but to echo the strength of the Communist Party in the north with their own strength, forcing Chiang Kai-shek not to launch a civil war. On the one hand, China would resist Japan to the end, and on the other hand, the southwestern military men could maintain their strength.

At this time, he colluded with the American consul in Yunnan and senior American military officers in Yunnan. He believed that after World War II, the political influence of the United States in China would increase. He was pro-American and worshipped America in his diplomatic route. This semi-colonial thinking of his is very shameful to think about today. Luo Longji said that his attitude towards the student movement in the southwest at that time was superficially very left-wing, but in his heart, he was taking the middle road. This was still to please the intellectuals and win over the youth as his political capital. The example of vying for the Youth League was to prepare for the strength of the third road.

Luo Longji said that after Japan surrendered in 1945, Chairman Mao went to Chongqing, and he met Chairman Mao in Chongqing. This was the first time he met Chairman Mao. He was deeply inspired. He also met with Premier Zhou, Elder Dong, and others in Chongqing frequently, which had a great influence on his work in the Democratic League during that period and prevented him from falling into the quagmire. In October 1945, the Democratic League held its first national temporary representative assembly. At that time, it was brewing to hold the Old Political Consultative Conference. Whether the Democratic League stood on the side of the Kuomintang or on the side of the Communist Party was a question of fierce struggle within the Democratic League. What was his thinking at that time? He thought that after the Old Political Consultative Conference, Chiang Kai-shek would implement the agreement of the Old Political Consultative Conference, China might have Anglo-American-style parliamentary politics, and the Democratic League could be between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. And China could implement a pro-American policy. He also wanted to show off his individualistic skills in the parliament and be in the limelight more. Luo Longji also said: In Chongqing, he indeed had a lot of collusion with Marshall of the United States. Marshall did not agree with the Democratic League being overly pro-communist, and he did some explanation work on this point. He told him that China would implement Anglo-American-style constitutional government in the future, and the Democratic League would take a pro-American route.

Luo Longji said that in 1946, the resumed peace talks in Nanjing broke down, and Chiang Kai-shek wanted to convene the bogus National Assembly. Whether the Democratic League should participate in the bogus National Assembly became a fierce struggle within the Democratic League. The National Socialist Party decided to participate. Chiang Kai-shek knew that the National Salvation Association and the Third Party would not participate. Chiang Kai-shek hoped that Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, and he would participate, so that he could still steal the name of the Democratic League to make deceptive appeals. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek sent Duan Haoxu and Lei Zhen to contact him privately, saying that as long as he participated, he could choose one of the two ministers originally planned for the Communist Party, the Minister of Economic Affairs or the Minister of Transportation, and he could nominate thirty or forty bogus National Assembly representatives from his friends within the Democratic League. Luo Longji said that he "refused to participate" in the bogus National Assembly at that time. He said that the reason why he "refused to participate" was because he believed that Chiang Kai-shek would not implement Anglo-American-style democracy. If the Communist Party did not participate in the bogus National Assembly, the country would not be peaceful, there could be no parliamentary politics, and his so-called third force could not play a role between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. He said that at this time, he was indeed still dreaming a shameful dream of the third road, Anglo-American democracy, and comprador diplomacy. Later, Chiang Kai-shek launched a civil war again, and he indeed could not see that the Liberation Army would win in such a short period of time, and that Chiang Kai-shek would collapse in such a short period of time. He lived in Premier Zhou's residence in Nanjing, taking care of the property left behind for the Communist Party on the one hand, and frequently colluding with the US Ambassador to China, Stuart. He thought that the civil war would still be "fighting, stopping, fighting again," and peace talks would be resumed. He was still fantasizing about expanding the Democratic League organization to prepare for the strength of the third major political party in the future. In 1947, Chiang Kai-shek coerced the dissolution of the Democratic League headquarters. At that time, Shen Henglao and Zhang Bojun secretly fled to Hong Kong from Shanghai. He was arrested in Nanjing. Chiang Kai-shek wanted to send him to Guling. After Stuart's negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek, he was sent to Shanghai to recuperate. At this time, Lei Zhen of the Kuomintang always came to see him in Shanghai once a month and paid the hospital bills at the same time. The US Embassy and the US Consulate in Shanghai also frequently sent people to contact him at the hospital. He agreed with the Third Plenary Session held by the Democratic League in Hong Kong. But he did not agree with the one-sided policy of the Third Plenary Session. The letter he asked Wu Han to bring to Beijing for Shen Henglao, to reserve the condition that the Democratic League could withdraw from the coalition government at any time, did exist. This matter can be explained in passing today. This was discussed by Chairman Zhang and Huang Renlao in my ward, and I wrote it down. All this shows that he insisted on the pro-American third road.

Fundamentally No Concept of Accepting the Leadership of the Communist Party

Luo Longji then talked about his activities from the liberation in 1949 to the present. He said that after the liberation of Shanghai in 1949, he and Biao Lao went to Beijing. Before leaving Shanghai, he had met with Stuart once in Shanghai. He proposed to him that if the Communist Party did not lean to the Soviet Union, the United States could lend 6 billion US dollars in installments to help China's construction. He wanted him to convey this message to Premier Zhou. This was a fact. He agreed with this American opinion very much at the time. He thought at the time that a poor country like China could not be built without foreign aid. To mention foreign aid, only the United States could provide it. This shows that his thinking at that time was to build a capitalist China, to make China's semi-colonial status go further down and become a colony of the United States. This is such a shameful thought. When he arrived in Beijing, seeing that the situation was not right, he did not pass on the message to Premier Zhou, and instead, at the home of Zhang Dongsun's son, he told the American consul in Beijing to send a telegram to Stuart, saying that he could not convey this message.

Luo Longji then briefly confessed a few things that he thought were more important. He said that a few days after he arrived in Beijing, Chairman Mao invited him to talk alone. When talking about the relationship between the Democratic League and the Party, he expressed to Chairman Mao his hope that the Party members in the League would be public, but he did not say that Party members should withdraw from the Democratic League. Chairman Mao then said: "You don't want to purge the Party within the League." This matter did happen. This shows that after he came to Beijing, he fundamentally did not have the concept of accepting the leadership of the Party in his mind.

Luo Longji also said that after the Political Consultative Conference, although he himself became a member of the Government Council, the treatment he received from the Party was relatively cold compared to others. He was originally a person who wanted to climb up, a person with a very strong concept of fame and wealth. He also had dissatisfaction with the Party. Minister Li Weihan and Deputy Minister Xing Xiping had come to talk to him at his residence several times because of his dissatisfaction. He did not completely blame the Party at the time, he very much blamed Zhang Bojun and Shi Liang for doing the work of instigating discord. Therefore, Zhang Dongsun and he invited this group of people in the Democratic League who had emotions and dissatisfaction to form the so-called invisible organization at that time. This invisible organization met frequently at that time. Sometimes they even met at Chairman Zhang Lan's place, complaining a lot in front of him. By the time of the Fourth Plenary Session, it had completely become a factional struggle. The Fourth Plenary Session could not be concluded after two months, this was the reason. Luo Longji also said that in order to strive for a better political position, he should mainly expand the actual strength of the Democratic League, and his own invisible organization should strive for the leadership position of the Democratic League. He said this to the people in the invisible organization and did so. It can be said that from that time on, he abandoned the third road and began to dream of dividing the court and resisting the rites. He was always active in the invisible organization. This was the situation from 1949 to 1952. Later, the Three-Anti Movement was launched, and Zhang Dongsun's case of colluding with secret agents was discovered. This was beyond his expectations. He was deeply afraid of being implicated. During the Three-Anti Movement, people like Liu Wang Liming and Pan Guangdan became the targets of struggle. He was indeed frightened. Later, thanks to the Party's upholding of justice, Zhang Dongsun's case did not involve him, and he was protected during the Three-Anti Movement. He was very grateful to the Party.

Using Old Intellectuals as Capital to Divide the Court and Resist the Rites with the Party

Luo Longji said that he did not engage in "invisible organizations" after that, however, Luo Longji also said: When friends from other places came to Beijing, he always met them to talk, but they were all separate talks, and he never gathered them together to talk, in order to avoid the suspicion of sectarianism.

Luo Longji reiterated his three statements. He said:

First, he has not sent anyone to any place to do any political activities in the past two years.

Second, he has not written letters to anyone in the invisible organization in the past two or three years to instruct or discuss any conspiracies related to politics or League affairs.

Third, he has not asked anyone to bring messages to anyone in the invisible organization in the past two or three years to instruct any activities related to politics or League affairs. He said that the reason why he made this statement was that the crimes he committed should not involve anyone, and the crimes committed by others should absolutely not involve him.

Luo Longji then denied the Zhang-Luo Alliance. He said that he absolutely did not have anything that was only secretly discussed with Zhang Bojun before being implemented. But he had to admit that the four committees established in May this year, such as the Party Committee system, were exceptions. Luo Longji also said that of course, in the Democratic League's policy, he supported some of Zhang Bojun's proposals, which caused the Democratic League to lose its direction and go the wrong way. Luo Longji refused to confess the inside story of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. He said that he really could not think of any specific events to confess.

Luo Longji talked about the issue of intellectuals. He said that this was a key issue in his making mistakes. He believed that the Democratic League should represent the so-called legitimate interests of backward intellectuals, and should be appealed by the Democratic League, a legitimate organ. Therefore, the Democratic League adopted the policy of encouraging old intellectuals to use the guise of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to greatly speak out. Therefore, the Democratic League took the wrong path in its policy and deviated from its direction.

Luo Longji said, what is the root cause of his mistakes? Of course, it is the decadent bourgeois ideology. What is the purpose? Isn't it to please the bourgeois intellectuals, to raise his own prestige, expand the League's organization, and use these old intellectuals as his political capital, so that the Democratic League can divide the court and resist the rites with the leading Party. His several speeches in the United Front Work Department in May more specifically showed his arrogant and shameful ambition.

### 罗隆基在民盟整风会上的交代

    罗隆基在民盟整风会上的交代
    本报讯　罗隆基在12日民盟中央第七次整风扩大座谈会上对自己一贯的反动活动事实作了一些交代。现摘要报道如下：
    彻头彻尾的反共反苏
    罗隆基在检讨中承认了他从三十年前开始的一贯的罪恶活动。但是他的检讨偏重于解放以前的历史事实，而对解放后的反动言行则交代得很少。
    罗隆基首先谈到他从1928年从国外回来到1932年离开上海，到天津做天津益世报主笔的时期的活动。他说，在这个时期我是彻头彻尾反苏反共的。我回到上海后，胡适、徐志摩、梁实秋等人就拉我加入了“新月”杂志，并且不久我还做了新月的主编人。我开始在这个杂志上写政治文章。那时候我的政治思想是彻头彻尾反苏反共的。我是英国拉斯基教授的学生，他是反苏反共的反动的政治学者，他并且有一套反苏反共的理论。我就贩运了拉斯基一套腐朽的理论在新月广为推销。我在新月上发表过一篇“论共产”的长文章，那是从理论上来反对共产主义的文章。这篇文章在今天看来，它的荒谬的程度远在我其它反动文章之上的。我在二十八九年前对当时的知识分子和青年就散布了许多反共的毒素。
    1927年是南昌起义解放军建军的伟大的纪念日期，那时候共产党领导的中国人民革命刚开始。蒋介石以武力进行所谓的“剿共”。我在新月上发表文章，认为武力解决不了共产主义，要在思想上进攻。我就贩卖了拉斯基一套，做中国思想上反共的先锋，配合蒋的武力剿共，这是多么大的罪恶。
    罗隆基又说，二十八年前，我不止思想上是反共，我的政治活动亦是反共的。我回国以后在上海就认识了国社党的头子张君劢、张东荪，青年党的头子曾琦、左舜生、李璜等人。我同这一批人当时气味相投，成了政治上的朋友。这两个党，大家都知道是坚决反苏反共的。我不久就加入了国社党。青年党同国社党是当时密切合作的两个所谓的在野党，实际上都与蒋介石政权有关系的，特别是青年党是公开参加蒋介石的反共战争的，在二万里长征的时候，红军经过四川，青年党的李璜就动员四川全部青年党员帮助“剿共”。在政治行动上我参加了张君劢的国社党，在政治思想上我为胡适主编新月杂志，这是我回国初期的丑恶历史。
    罗隆基接着又谈到1932年到1937年这个时期他的活动。这个时期，他一直是益世报的主笔。罗隆基说，益世报为什么请我做主笔，益世报是天主教的报纸，我不是天主教徒。主要原因是我有一套腐朽的反共理论。在这个时期，日本帝国主义侵略中国的“九一八”事件发生了。罗隆基说他在这个时期的政治思想仍是反共、反苏，但又说他在对日抗战这个问题上是主张“联共抗日的”。他说蒋介石当时还是要对日投降的，他的政策是：“安内而后攘外”，又说“攘外必先安内”。他说胡适是拥护这个政策的。而他则主张“枪口对外”，“攘外而后安内”。罗隆基接着说：当然，我必须特别声明，我的思想还是反共、反苏，只就“攘外而后安内”这句话就清楚了。“安内”是什么呢？还不是蒋介石安内的意义。我是劝他等到抗日胜利之后，再来进行反共。
    罗隆基承认他在这个时期是一个两面派。他一方面同进步人士联系，另一方面又同反动力量国社党青年党勾结。
    崇美亲美的第三条路线
    罗隆基接着又谈到他在1937年到1949年解放时期的活动。他说这个时期是他坚持中间路线的时期。他说，抗日战争所以能够发动，坚持，并且取得最后胜利，这是共产党的力量，是共产党领导中国人民民主统一战线的力量。1941年，共产党国民党以外的许多党派在重庆组织了中国民主政团同盟。我是发起人之一。组织民主政团同盟的动机，就是要在共产党国民党外造成一个第三种力量，以贯彻第三条路线。我参加起草民主政团同盟的纲领以及起草几次大会的政治报告，都很明显地表示要采用英美的民主，要走第三条路线。军队国家化、政治民主化，这两句话是什么意思呢？军队国家化就是要红军停止武力革命。政治民主化就是英美的民主。罗隆基谈到他在民主政团同盟中的政治倾向时说，青年党、国社党是拥蒋的，左派和进步人士是拥护共产党的，我在1941年就脱离了国社党，我是始终坚持中间路线的。那时候，我还是想把民主同盟造成中国第三个大的政党。那时候，我还有这个想法，中国的政党非有武力不可，我就把民主同盟的基础放在中国的西南，四川、云南、广东、广西等省。当时四川有实力的三个军人：邓锡侯、潘文华、刘文辉是民盟主席张澜的学生和朋友，张主席对他们是有影响的。李任潮先生在广西，他对两广的军人有影响。我在云南西南联大教书，通过缪云台的关系我对当时云南主席龙云是做了一番联络工作的。缪云台是官僚资本家，是美国留学生，他同我的思想是一路的，他反苏反共走美国路线，他现在还在美国。那时候，我的想法以及西南地方军人的想法都不是对共产党的一面倒，而是以实力与北方共产党的实力相呼应，迫使蒋介石不敢发动内战，一方面中国抗日到底，另一方面，西南军人可以保持实力。
    这时候我同在云南的美国领事和在云南的美军高级军官是有勾结的。我以为第二次世界大战后，美国在中国的政治影响会增加。我在外交路线上是亲美、崇美的，我这种半殖民的思想到今天想来是十分可耻的。罗隆基说他当时在西南对学生运动的态度在表面上做得很左，内心却是中间路线。这还是在讨好知识青年，争取青年做我政治的资本。要抢青年同盟就是个例子，是准备第三条路线的实力。
      罗隆基说，1945年日本投降后，毛主席到了重庆，我到重庆见到了毛主席。这是我第一次同毛主席见面。我受到很深的感召。我同周总理董老等人亦在重庆经常见面了，这对我那个时期对民盟的工作曾有了很大的影响，而没有陷入泥坑。1945年10月民主同盟举行第一次全国临时代表大会，那时正酝酿着要举行旧政协。民主同盟到底站在国民党方面，还是站在共产党方面，这是民主同盟内部激烈斗争的一个问题。在当时我的想法是怎样的呢？我以为旧政协以后，蒋介石会实行旧政协的协定，中国可能有英美式的议会政治，而民主同盟可以左右于共产党与国民党之间。并且中国可以实现亲美政策。我还想在议会中大显我这个个人主义的身手，可以多出风头。罗隆基又说：在重庆时，我同美国的马歇尔的确有了很多勾结。马歇尔并不赞成民盟过分的亲共，我在这点上作了解释工作。我告诉他今后中国是实行英美式的宪政，民主同盟是亲美路线的。
    罗隆基说，1946年，南京的再度和谈破裂，蒋介石要召开伪国大。民主同盟是否参加伪国大成了一个民盟内部的激烈斗争。国社党决定要参加。蒋介石知道救国会第三党不会参加的。蒋介石希望黄炎培、梁漱溟和我参加，这样仍然可以盗用民主同盟的名义来做欺骗的号召。这时候蒋介石派段浩徐、雷震向我私人接洽过，只要我参加，我可以在经济部长或交通部长两个原来预定给共产党的部长中挑选一个，并且可以在民盟内部我的朋友中提三、四十个伪国大代表。罗隆基说他当时是“拒绝参加”伪国大的。他说，他之所以“拒绝参加，是因为他认为蒋介石不会实行英美式的民主。共产党不参加伪国大，国家不会和平，不可能有议会政治，而我所谓的第三种力量不能起左右于国共之间的作用。他说，这时候，我的确还在做第三条路线、英美民主、买办外交的可耻的迷梦。后来蒋介石又发动内战，我的确看不出解放军会在这样短的时间内取得胜利，蒋介石会在这样快的时间内垮台。我住在南京的周总理的住宅，一方面为共产党照顾留下来的财产，一方面却经常与美国驻华大使司徒雷登勾结。我以为内战还是“打打停停打打停”，还会恢复和谈的。我还在幻想扩大民盟组织准备将来第三个大政党的力量。1947年蒋介石威迫解散民盟总部，那时候沈衡老、章伯钧在上海秘密地逃到香港去了。我在南京被捕。蒋介石要把我送到牯岭去。经过司徒雷登向蒋介石的交涉，才把我送到上海去养病。这时候国民党的雷震每个月总要到上海来看我一次，同时交医院费。美国大使馆和上海美国领事馆亦经常派人到医院来联系。民主同盟在香港举行三中全会我是赞成的。但三中全会一边倒的政策我的确不同意。我托吴晗带到北京来给沈衡老的信，要保留民盟随时可以退出联合政府这个条件是有的。这件事今天可以顺便说明一句，这是张主席、黄任老几个人在我病房里商量好的，由我执笔写的。这一切事都说明我坚持亲美的第三条路线。
    根本没有接受共产党领导的概念
    罗隆基然后谈到他从1949年解放到现在的活动。他说，1949年上海解放后我同表老到了北京。在离开上海前，我在上海还同司徒雷登见过一次面。他向我提出，假使共产党不向苏联一边倒，美国可以分期借六十亿美元帮助中国的建设，他要我向周总理转这个口信，这是事实。我当时是很同意美国这种意见的。我当时以为像中国这样贫穷的国家，没有经济外援是建设不起来的。要提外援，只有美国。这说明我当时的思想是要建设一个资本主义的中国，要使中国半殖民的地位再往下走，成为美国的殖民地。这是多么可耻的思想。我到了北京，看形势不对，我没有把消息转告周总理，并且在张东荪的儿子家里转告美国在北京的领事要他转电司徒雷登，说这个口信我不能转达。
    罗隆基接着又简单地交代了几件他认为比较重要的事。他说，我到北京几天以后，毛主席约我单独地谈过一次话，谈到民盟与党的关系时，我向毛主席表示，希望在盟内的党员公开，却没有说过要党员退出民盟。毛主席接着说：“你不要在盟内清党。”这件事是有的。这说明我到北京来后，思想中根本没有接受党的领导这个概念。
    罗隆基又说，政协开会后，我自己虽然做了政务委员，但我得到党的待遇比较起来是冷淡的。我本来是个往上爬的人，是个名利观念很重的人。我对党就亦有了不满情绪。李维汉部长、邢西萍副部长为了我的不满情绪曾到我住的地方谈过好几次。我当时并不完全怨党，我很埋怨章伯钧、史良做了挑拨离间的工作。因此张东荪同我就邀集了这一批民盟有情绪不满的人成立了当时所谓的无形组织。这个无形组织当时是经常碰头的。有时并且在张澜主席的地方碰头，在他面前发许多怨言。到了四中全会，就完全成了一个派系斗争。四中全会开了两个月不能结束，就是这个缘故。罗隆基又说，为要争取政治上更好的地位，主要应该扩大民主同盟的实际力量，而我自己的无形组织应争取民盟的领导地位。我对无形组织的人都是这样说的，这样做的。当时我要布置民盟中央和地方的力量，主要就是这个目的。这可以说，从那时候起，我放弃了第三条路线，而开始做分庭抗礼的梦了。我对无形组织始终是积极的。这是1949年到1952年这个时期的情况。后来三反运动发动了，张东荪勾结特务案件发觉了。这是出乎我意料之外的。我深怕牵涉在内。三反的时候，无形组织中像刘王立明、潘光旦都做了被斗争的对象。我的确胆战心惊。后来由于党的主持公道，张东荪案件没有牵涉到我，而三反时我又被保护过关，我对党是十分感谢的。
    利用旧知识分子作资本同党分庭抗礼
    罗隆基说他从那时以后，就不搞“无形组织”，不过，罗隆基又说：外地的朋友到北京来了，总要见面谈谈的，但都是分别谈话，从没有约集在一块谈过，为的是避免宗派嫌疑。
    罗隆基重申他的三点声明。他说：
    第一、最近两年来我没有派任何人到任何地方做任何政治活动。
    第二、最近两三年来我没有与无形组织中写过信件指示或商讨有关政治或盟务的阴谋活动。
    第三、最近两三年来我没有托任何人带口信给无形组织中任何人指示政治或盟务的活动。他说他所以这样声明，为的是，他犯的罪过不应当牵涉到任何人，别人所犯的罪过亦绝对不应当牵涉到他。
    罗隆基接着又否认章罗联盟，他说，他绝对没有什么事只是章伯钧同他秘密商谈后就执行的。但是他又不得不承认，今年5月间成立的党委制等四个委员会是例外。罗隆基又说，当然，在民盟政策上，我支持了章伯钧某些主张因而使民盟迷失了方向，走错了道路。罗隆基拒绝交代章罗联盟的内幕，他说他实在想不出什么具体的事件来交代。
    罗隆基谈到知识分子问题。他说这是他犯错误的一个关键问题。他认为民主同盟应该代表落后知识分子所谓的合法利益，应由民主同盟这个合法机关来代为呼吁，于是民盟就采取了鼓励旧知识分子利用“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的幌子来大放大鸣。于是民盟就在政策上走错了道路，走偏了方向。
    罗隆基说，我犯错误的思想根源到底是什么呢？当然是腐朽的资产阶级思想。目的是什么，还不是向资产阶级知识分子讨好，想抬高自己的声望，扩大盟的组织，拿这些旧知识分子来做我的政治资本，使民盟能够与领导党分庭抗礼。我5月间在统战部的几次发言更具体表明了我这种狂妄的可耻的野心。
