　　Xiang De's Habitual Practice of Playing Double-Faced Tricks
    Changsha Industrial and Commercial Circles Expose His Mask
    (Our Dispatch) The Changsha Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) and the Changsha Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce (CFIC) Executive Committee jointly held a meeting to criticize and expose Xiang De's anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds.

    Xiang De, a Standing Committee member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, a member of the Central Committee of the CDNCA, and Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, made speeches at the symposium of responsible persons of democratic parties convened by the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on May 20, and at the Hunan Provincial CPPCC meeting on May 23, entitled "What are the reasons hindering the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen?", making vicious attacks on the Communist Party. For example, he said that sectarianism is the root of the three major isms; that when the Communist Party consults with non-Party members, it is genuine intention, but fake consultation; that Party members depend on non-Party members in business but do not trust them politically; that in the past, it was easy to be an official if one had someone in the imperial court, but now it is easy to be an official if one is a Communist Party member! The Communist Party only allows magistrates to burn down houses while forbidding common people even to light lamps, etc. He also used individual exaggerated examples to slander the Communist Party for not caring about the suffering of private personnel. He completely attributed the reasons hindering the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen to the Party's sectarianism, but did not mention a word about the negative side of industrialists and businessmen.

    On May 24, Xiang De went to Beijing to attend a symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. His original intention was also to speak on the above content. Before leaving, he held a series of meetings and collected materials from various sources to attack the Party. After arriving in Beijing, seeing the change in the situation, he immediately changed his tune and spoke a set of beautiful words, such as saying that fixed interest is exploitation. However, according to Dai Ziqi's exposure, in a letter Xiang De sent him from Beijing, he said that he agreed with fixed interest for twenty years.

    In fact, Xiang De's double-dealing tactics have been consistent. For example, when Comrade Li Weihan came to Hunan last year, he asked Xiang De about the situation of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen in Hunan. He said that the lives of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen were very good, and patted his stomach, saying that he had gained a lot of weight. However, when he came to Beijing for a meeting, he represented the small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen of eighteen provinces to meet Chairman Mao, but said that small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen could not survive, and actually lied in front of Chairman Mao. The responsible comrades of the united front departments of the provincial and municipal Party committees had asked him about the work of the Party member Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce. He said that the person was very good and responsible, but he told people in industrial and commercial circles that this Party member Deputy Secretary-General was practicing dictatorship.

    Xiang De is also a loyal follower of Zhang Naiqi. As early as the first session of the Changsha Municipal People's Congress, he preached the fallacy that the Chinese national bourgeoisie had no exploitation. Not long ago, in a study group on political economics, he confidently said that after the capitalists handed over the enterprises, the fixed interest was no longer exploitation, and he tried his best to beautify the bourgeoisie.

    Xiang De also attempted to separate the CDNCA organization and the CFIC from the leadership of the Party. On the evening of May 16 this year, the Changsha Municipal Committee of the CDNCA held a "speaking out" symposium for members of the organization. Xiang De said that the socialist transformation was over, and there was no difference between the CDNCA and the Communist Party. Xiang De once said to others that some people in the Changsha Municipal Committee of the CDNCA always use the United Front Work Department as a tool to suppress others. Our democratic party organizations should be independent and autonomous. Now we are just learning to walk after leaving our mother's womb, and we should not ask the United Front Work Department for instructions in everything.

    Since liberation, Xiang De has repeatedly hindered political movements and attacked activists. In the early days of Changsha's liberation, in order to support the liberation of Hengyang and other regions, Changsha raised 60,000 silver dollars, which was handled by the Municipal Reception and Relief Joint Association. Xiang De was the chairman of the presidium of the Reception and Relief Joint Association, responsible for the work in the industrial and commercial sector. He stood aside and pushed the glorious task to others. He was also negative about tax work in various periods. In the self-examination and supplementary reporting movement in 1953, he also shirked responsibility, and after the task was overfulfilled and completed ahead of schedule, he said that the cadres were "fond of boasting and exaggerating." He was also negative and evasive about purchasing public bonds. He always poured cold water on cadres who actively promoted the sale of public bonds.

    Xiang De's true face of opposing the Party and opposing socialism has been completely exposed, and people in the industrial and commercial circles of Changsha are preparing to further expose and struggle against him.

### 向德玩弄两面派手法积习成性  长沙工商界揭开他的假面具

　　向德玩弄两面派手法积习成性
    长沙工商界揭开他的假面具
    本报讯　民建长沙市委、长沙市工商联执委曾举行联席会议，批判和揭发向德的反共反社会主义言行。
    全国工商联常委、民建中央委员、湖南省工商联主委向德在5月20日中共长沙市委召开的各民主党派负责人座谈会上的发言，和5月23日在湖南省政协会议上以“是什么原因阻碍了工商业者积极性的发挥”为题的发言，对共产党进行了恶毒的攻击，如说宗派主义是三大主义的根子；共产党与党外人士商量问题，是真主意假商量；党员对非党员是业务上要依赖，政治上不信任；过去是朝庭有人好做官，现在是共产党员好做官！共产党是只准州官放火，不准百姓点灯等。他还用个别的夸大了的事例诬蔑共产党不关心私方人员疾苦。他把阻碍工商业者积极性发挥的原因完全归咎于党的宗派主义，对于工商业者消极一面，却只字未提。
    5月24日，向德去北京参加中共中央统战部召开的座谈会。原意也是就上述内容发言。临行前，他曾召开过一系列的会议，多方搜集向党进攻的材料。到北京后，一看形势变化，连忙见风使舵，讲了一套漂亮话，如说定息是剥削。但据戴子骐揭露，向德在北京寄给他的信中，曾说同意定息二十年。
    其实，向德的两面派手法是一贯的。如去年李维汉同志到湖南来时曾问向德湖南中小工商业者的情况。他说中小工商业者生活很好，并拍着自己的肚子说，我就胖了很多。可是他来到北京开会时，代表十八省中小工商业者去见毛主席，却又说中小工商业者生活不下去了，居然在毛主席面前撒谎。省市党委统战部门负责同志，曾向他了解市工商联党员副秘书长的工作情况，他说人很好很负责，但他对工商界人士则说，这位党员副秘书长专政。
    向德还是章乃器的忠实信徒。远在长沙市第一届人民代表会上，他就宣扬过中国民族资产阶级没有剥削的谬论。不久前，在学习政治经济学的小组会上，他又振振有词的说，资本家交出了企业以后，定息就不算剥削了，极力美化资产阶级。
    向德还企图使民建组织和工商联脱离党的领导。今年5月16日晚上，民建市委召开机关会员“鸣”“放”座谈会，向德说社会主义改造结束了，民建与共产党没有什么区别。向德曾对人说，长沙市民建会内有些人，总拿统战部作压服别人的工具，我们民主党派组织要独立自主，现在是初脱娘胎学走路，不要事事向统战部请示。
    向德解放以来屡次阻碍政治运动，打击积极分子。长沙解放初期，为了支援解放衡阳等地区，长沙市人筹借六万银元款子，由市迎解联合会办理，向德是迎解联合会主席团的主席，负责工商界方面的工作，他对待这样光荣的任务置身事外，站在一边，推给别人去搞。他对各个时期的税收工作也是消极的。1953年自查补报运动，他也把责任推掉，超额和提前完成了以后，他反而说干部是“好大喜功”。认购公债，他也是消极躲避的。对于积极推销公债的干部，总是泼冷水。
    向德反党反社会主义的真实面目，已经原形毕露，长沙市工商界人士准备对他进行进一步的揭露和斗争。
