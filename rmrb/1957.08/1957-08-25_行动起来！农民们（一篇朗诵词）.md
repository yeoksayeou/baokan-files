Beat the myriad wooden drums, clang the thousand bronze bells! Let me borrow this resounding drumbeat, this pealing bell, to cry out to my beloved fields, the shade of the high mountains, the streams, the silkworm frames!
Cry out, act! Farmers!
Defend our path – socialism!
Defend our home – the cooperative!

Fellow villagers,
The clouds of May have not yet dispersed,
The storm is raging fiercely.
The counterattack of lawless landlords and rich peasants has already begun.
A few small sticks of dynamite vainly attempt to blast through ten million square kilometers of land.
Look! Villagers,
In Xiangyang, the local tyrant of Shi Lizixiang holds the head of a poor peasant brother.
On the Leizhou Peninsula, one hundred and twenty-seven cases of reversing settlements!
The hot blood of a family of seven dyes the knife of lawless landlords red.
A loving mother's milk and blood ignite a flame of warning on the ground.
Villagers! Can we tolerate this?

In the deep of night, under the starlight, landlords are measuring the fields, plotting to seize the land of the cooperative.
On rainy days, landlords are spying on your houses from the window,
As if he's moved back in,
While you carry a bamboo basket, wearing tattered clothes, taking your family, old and young, to a desperate path in a foreign land, amidst his vile laughter…
Villagers! Can we tolerate this?

Sorcerers, witches, counter-revolutionaries mutter incantations:
"Deliver all living beings,"
But a pistol hides beneath their cassock.
That death-spreading muzzle is aimed at you, your family, your hometown, your cooperative,
At the chest of the young republic!
Villagers! Can we tolerate this?

No! We cannot tolerate it!
Haven't they killed enough of our people?
No! They have been killing us for thousands of years.
Quick, strike down their butcher knives!
No! We cannot tolerate it!
Haven't they seized enough of our land?
No! Our ancestors have not been buried.
Quick, smash their attempts to reverse settlements!

Farmers! Act!
You, the experts at pulling out weeds, must never let your hoes rust!
You, the heroes of past revolutions, must never forget the struggle!
Listen! The wooden drums beat louder and louder!
Listen! The bronze bells clang louder and louder!

Act! Already acting!
I see crowds of ten thousand surrounding the cars of right-wing elements,
Debating, blocking their path to the countryside.
I see formations of five thousand capturing murderous thugs.
The enemy falls into the dust!
Good! Villagers,
Workers are cheering you!
Good! Villagers,
All of China is cheering you!

Forward! An unbreakable army!
Let our cooperatives grow and thrive like your children!
Let us answer the curses of right-wing enemies with a thousandfold harvest!
Let us give a new demonstration to all groups that are hostile to us!
Socialism must triumph in China!
