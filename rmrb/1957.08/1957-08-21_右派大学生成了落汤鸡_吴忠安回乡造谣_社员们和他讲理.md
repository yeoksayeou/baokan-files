　　Right-Wing College Student Becomes a Drenched Chicken
　　Wu Zhong'an Spreads Rumors Upon Returning Home
　　Commune Members Reason With Him
　　Rightist Wu Zhong'an is from Houyin Village, Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative, Shima Township, Dantu County, Jiangsu Province. His current name is Wu Xinfu, and he studies in the Mathematics Department of Jiangsu Normal College. On July 17th, when he returned to his hometown for vacation, Xu Zhengfu, the Party Branch Secretary, welcomed him and introduced him to the cooperative's efforts to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, hoping he would help the Party organization with some publicity and education work. However, for more than ten days, Wu Zhong'an has been deliberately creating rumors among the peasant masses, inciting them to oppose the Party and the government. The peasants are very disgusted with him. The head of Shima Township also had a sincere conversation with him. Wu Zhong'an not only did not accept everyone's education and advice, but instead intensified his activities among the rich peasants, propagating the trouble-making experiences of a few right-wing students, and encouraging the rich peasants to rise up and sabotage.
    The members of the Qianjin Cooperative in Shima Township, having reached the end of their patience, decided to hold a representative forum to reason and struggle with Wu Zhong'an.
    Commune member Wu Mingshan was the first to speak at the meeting. He said to Wu Zhong'an: "You told me that 'Chairman Mao's article on the correct handling of contradictions among the people was published too early, causing social unrest,' and fabricated rumors that the Central Committee and Premier Zhou did not agree. Your statement is an attempt to shift the responsibility for the rightists' attack on socialism onto Chairman Mao, which is simply wicked to the core." Wu Mingshan then exposed Wu Zhong'an's distortion and slander of the Party's policy towards intellectuals. He said, "On the evening of the 20th, while cooling off behind the school, I mentioned that there was no cure for the rice disease 'underground fire,' and felt that our country's natural sciences were still backward. Wu Zhong'an said to me: Our country's science is not backward, it's just that scientists are being lazy. I asked him why they were being lazy, and he said it was mainly because the Communist Party's policy towards intellectuals was not good; either they were forced to work, monitored by the army, or they were lured to join the Party, using Party spirit to make them work; or they used words like abandoning the old and cultivating the new to intimidate intellectuals." At this time, many peasants at the meeting questioned Wu Zhong'an about his basis for these claims. Wu Zhong'an falsely claimed that it was in the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. When someone at the scene produced the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and proved that there were no such fallacies in the history, this college student again fabricated rumors that it was said by Stalin.
    Commune member Wu Mingshan also exposed Wu Zhong'an's words and deeds undermining the participation of primary and secondary school graduates in labor: As soon as Wu Zhong'an arrived home, he lectured the graduates, propagating that "participating in agricultural production is the most difficult, you must be a learned person; to have learning, you must go to school." Wu Mingshan said: At that time, I cited the self-taught famous mathematician Hua Luogeng to refute him, but he actually said: Isn't that just government exaggeration. Later, when Township Head Chen helped Wu Zhong'an, he said with conviction: Hua Luogeng originally attended middle school, and was later admitted as an auditor at Peking University, went to France to study, France could not solve his problem, so he went to the United States, and studied well in the United States. Wu Mingshan said: We peasants do not know Hua Luogeng's entire experience, but it is a fact that the countryside needs primary and secondary school graduates; we peasants can smell the scent and know that Wu Zhong'an has pro-American and worshipful-American ideas.
    Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative accountant Wu Mingsheng and retired soldier Zou Kecheng then exposed the fact that this college student was provoking the relationship between the peasants and the government. Wu Mingsheng also exposed Wu Zhong'an's reactionary remarks inciting peasants to cause trouble, and questioned him: "What is the intention of you promoting students to cause trouble, having the courage to force the school to pay travel expenses for students to go to Beijing to cause trouble?" Retired soldier Zou Kecheng said: Wu Zhong'an's rumors and provocations are aimed at inciting the peasants to oppose the government, so that people with ulterior motives like them can take power. Take contraception for example, the government promotes contraception for the good of the people and the country, and it is done voluntarily by the people, but this college student portrays this matter as a central government regulation, saying that taxes will be imposed on those who have three children, causing the peasants to be dissatisfied with the Party.
    At the meeting, primary school teachers Gu Xiangzhen and Miao Changhua, and social education guidance worker Sun Qihu, also exposed Wu Zhong'an's words and deeds such as posing as a Communist Party member, forging documents, colluding with rich peasant elements, and slandering people's leaders. They all angrily raised many questions, demanding answers from Wu Zhong'an. In the face of irrefutable facts, Wu Zhong'an could not deny it, and only said: "What everyone said is right, I shouldn't have talked nonsense." He also repeatedly defended his mistakes, attempting to shift the responsibility onto others. The representatives of the commune members present unanimously demanded that Jiangsu Normal College properly discipline this right-wing student.

### 右派大学生成了落汤鸡  吴忠安回乡造谣　社员们和他讲理

　　右派大学生成了落汤鸡
　　吴忠安回乡造谣
　　社员们和他讲理
    右派分子吴忠安是江苏丹徒县石马乡前进农业社厚因村人。现名吴信夫，在江苏师范学院数学系读书。7月17日，当他回到故乡休假时，党支部书记许正富对他表示欢迎，向他介绍了社里争取秋季丰收的情况，希望他帮助党组织做些宣传教育工作。可是，十多天来，吴忠安反而专门在农民群众中造谣生事，煽动农民反对党和政府。农民对他很反感。石马乡乡长也曾专门跟他恳切地谈过话。吴忠安不但不接受大家对他的教育和劝告，反而变本加厉地到富农中间进行活动，宣扬少数右派学生的闹事经验，怂恿富农起来闹事、破坏。
    石马乡前进社的社员忍无可忍，决定召开代表座谈会，跟吴忠安进行说理斗争。
    社员吴明山第一个在会上发言。他对着吴忠安说：你在我面前说：“毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的文章发表得太早了，引起社会上的紊乱，并且造谣说中央和周总理都不同意。你的这种说法，是想把右派分子向社会主义进攻的责任，推到毛主席身上去，这简直是坏空了心。”吴明山接着揭露吴忠安歪曲和诬蔑党对知识分子政策的言行。他说：“二十号晚上在学校后边乘凉时，我说起稻子‘放地火’的病没法治，觉得我国自然科学还落后。吴忠安对我说：我国科学并不落后，就是科学家怠工。我问他为什么怠工，他说主要是共产党对知识分子的政策不好，不是强制工作，用军队监视，就是引诱知识分子入党，用党性要他们工作；或者用抛弃旧的、培养新的话来威吓知识分子。”这时，会场上许多农民责问吴忠安有什么根据，吴忠安诡称联共党史上有。当场有人拿出联共党史，证明联共党史上并没有这三点谬论时，这位大学生又造谣说是斯大林说的。
    社员吴明山还揭露了吴忠安破坏中小学毕业生参加劳动的言行：吴忠安一到家就给毕业生上课，宣传“参加农业生产最苦，一定要做个有学问的人；要学问，必须进学校读书。”吴明山说：当时，我曾举自学成功的名数学家华罗庚驳他，他竟说：这还不是政府的夸张。以后，陈乡长帮助吴忠安时，他还有根有据地说：华罗庚原来读过中学，以后被吸收为北大旁听生，去法国留学，法国不能解决他的问题，就到美国，在美国学好了的。吴明山说：我们农民不晓得华罗庚的全部经历，但农村要中小学毕业生是事实；我们农民闻闻气味，也闻得出吴忠安有崇美、亲美思想。
    前进农业社会计吴明生、复员军人邹克成接着揭发了这个大学生挑拨农民和政府关系的事实。吴明生还揭露了吴忠安煽动农民闹事的反动言论，他责问道：“你宣传学生闹事有胆量，强迫校方出路费给学生到北京闹事，是什么用意？”复员军人邹克成说：吴忠安造谣、挑拨，目的是煽动农民反对政府，让他们这样别有用心的人上台。就拿避孕来说，政府提倡避孕，是为人民和国家好的，是由人民自愿来避孕的，而这位大学生却把这件事说成中央规定的，说生了三个孩子就要报税，引起农民对党不满。
    会上，小学教师顾象桢、缪长华，社教辅导工作人员孙启虎等，还揭露了吴忠安冒充共产党员，伪造证件、勾结富农分子、诬蔑人民领袖等言行。他们都气愤地提出了许多责问，要求吴忠安解答。吴忠安在铁的事实面前，无法抵赖，只是说：“大家讲的都是对的，我不应该瞎说。”他还一再为自己的错误辩护，企图把责任推到旁人身上。到会的社员代表一致要求江苏师范学院好好管教这个右派学生。
