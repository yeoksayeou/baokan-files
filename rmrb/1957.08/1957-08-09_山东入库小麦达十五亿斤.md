    Shandong's Wheat Storage Reaches 1.5 Billion Jin
    (Our newspaper, Jinan, 8th dispatch) Reporter Xiang Cun reports: Shandong Province, one of the major wheat-producing areas in the country, had stored over 1,510 million jin of wheat by August 5th, completing more than 75% of the procurement plan. Twenty-five counties and cities have completed or exceeded their summer grain procurement tasks.
    After the extensive socialist ideological education movement was carried out in the vast rural areas of Shandong, especially after the great debate on the two roads of socialism and capitalism was launched on the grain issue, the enthusiasm of farmers to pay public grain and sell surplus grain has significantly increased. Just entering August, the daily wheat storage volume increased from 3-4 million jin in the previous period to about 8 million jin. The Linqi and Laiyang special districts, which are progressing relatively quickly, have completed more than 90% to 94% of their wheat procurement plans. This year, the Yongfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Heze County, which had a bumper harvest, sold 19,400 more jin of wheat to the state than originally planned, exceeding the original procurement target by 32%, in the spirit of "making up for deficiencies with surpluses."
    At present, a small number of counties in the province are performing poorly in completing their procurement tasks. For example, Huimin County's unified purchase task is 6 million jin, but only over 50,000 jin have been completed; Qidong County has only completed a little over 2% of its unified purchase task. In order to complete the province's procurement task, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee are paying attention to overcoming the right-leaning thoughts of cadres in grain work and further combating capitalist ideas in the countryside.

    山东入库小麦达十五亿斤
    本报济南8日电　记者向村报道：全国主要产麦区之一——山东省今年征购小麦，到8月5日为止，已入库十五亿一千多万斤，完成征购计划75％以上。有二十五个县市完成和超额完成了夏粮征购任务。
    在山东广大农村广泛开展了社会主义思想教育运动，特别在粮食问题上展开社会主义与资本主义的两条道路的大辩论后，农民缴纳公粮出售余粮的积极性显著提高。刚进入8月份，每天小麦入库量由前一时期的三、四百万斤，上升到八百万斤左右。进度比较快的临沂、莱阳等专区，已经完成小麦征购计划90％至94％以上。今年丰收的菏泽县永丰农业社，根据“以丰补歉”的精神，把今年增产的小麦多卖给了国家一万九千四百多斤，超过原征购任务32％。
    目前全省还有少数的县征购任务完成得很差。如惠民县统购任务是六百万斤，现在只完成五万多斤；齐东县只完成了统购任务的2％多一点。为了完成全省征购任务，中共山东省委和省人民委员会正在注意克服干部在粮食工作中的右倾思想，进一步同农村中的资本主义思想作斗争。
