Research and Prevention of Pine Caterpillars

Pine caterpillars are currently the most serious and widespread forest pests in our country. Their distribution ranges from Heilongjiang in the northeast to the borders of Yunnan and Guizhou in the southwest. They are present in almost every area where pine forests grow. Due to a lack of knowledge about the species of pine caterpillars themselves, their habits, and their relationship with external environmental factors, prevention and control work is often passive. We are often caught off guard, resulting in many avoidable losses. The various prevention and control methods used are also not ideal.

In response to the above problems, insect workers from the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Research Institute of Forestry of the Ministry of Forestry, agricultural colleges in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces, and the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences have carried out a series of research projects in the past few years.

Research has proven that there are at least three types of pine caterpillars in our country: In northern Liaoning, Changbai Mountain, and the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains forest areas, the one that harms larch, red pine, and fish scale pine is called the larch caterpillar. In southern Liaoning, Hebei, and Shandong, the one that harms oil pine and Japanese red pine is called the oil pine caterpillar. In the southern provinces of our country, the one that harms Masson's pine is called the Masson's pine caterpillar. Pine caterpillars have no activity or reproduction during the overwintering period, so this is a good time to eliminate them.

Pine caterpillars prefer hot, humid climates. Excessive rainfall, on the other hand, is detrimental to them. Pure forests are more severely affected, while mixed forests are less affected. Pine forests that are ten years old or older are most suitable for their growth. If the previous generation reproduces too much, the next generation will decrease, or else migrate. The reason for the decrease is, on the one hand, insufficient nutrition, which leads to a decline in the insect population, and on the other hand, an increase in natural enemies, which inhibits their growth. There are many types of natural enemies. According to known parasitic wasps and parasitic flies, there are no less than dozens of species. In addition, birds can also eat them.

In the past, the more widely used prevention and control method was manual capture, including egg collection, larva killing, cocoon picking, and moth catching, which has achieved good results in various places. Killing larvae is very important, because the larval stage is the longest and the pine forest is being harmed, so it should be carried out as early as possible, during the early larval stages. In addition to capture, larvae can be killed with 666 liquid in areas where conditions permit. In areas where water sources are scarce, 666 powder can be used.

　  松毛虫的研究和防治
    松毛虫是目前我国森林内最严重而普遍的害虫。它的分布从东北黑龙江一直到西南的云南、贵州边境，凡是生长松林的地区几乎都有。由于对松毛虫本身的种类、生活习性以及它和外界环境因子间的关系知道的太少，使防治工作经常陷于被动。常常事出措手不及，造成许多可以避免而没有避免的损失。所使用的各种防治方法，也都还不够理想。
    针对上述问题，中国科学院昆虫研究所、林业部林业科学研究所、广东、广西、江西、浙江等省农学院和华东农业科学研究所的虫害工作者们，在过去几年里进行了一系列的研究工作。
    经研究证明，我国至少有三种松毛虫：在辽宁省北部、长白山、大小兴安岭林区，为害落叶松、红松、鱼鳞松等的叫落叶松毛虫。在辽宁省南部、河北、山东为害油松和日本赤松的叫油松毛虫。在我国南部各省为害马尾松的叫马尾松毛虫。松毛虫在越冬时期没有活动，没有繁殖，所以这是消灭它的好时机。
    松毛虫比较喜欢高温、湿润的气候。雨量过多时，对它反而不利。单纯林受害重，混交林比较轻。十几年生的松林最适于它的生长。上一代繁殖过多，下一代就要减少，不然也要迁移。减少的原因，一方面由于营养不充分而虫口下降，另一方面由于天敌的增多而受到抑制。天敌的种类繁多，根据已知的寄生蜂和寄生蝇等昆虫就不下几十种。此外，鸟类也可以吃它。
    过去比较广泛采用的防治方法是人工捕杀，其中包括采卵、杀幼虫、摘茧和捕蛾，在各地都已获得良好的成绩。杀幼虫十分重要，因为幼虫期最长并且松林正在受害，所以还是应当尽量提早些，在幼虫幼龄的时候来进行防治。杀幼虫的方法，除捕捉之外，在有条件的地区，可以利用六六六液剂。水源困难地区，可以应用六六六粉剂。
