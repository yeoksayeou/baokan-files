Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 14th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter He Guofang reports): The publishing industry in Shanghai during the eight years since liberation has not been "worse than before," as some right-wing elements have slandered, but has experienced vigorous development.

According to statistics from relevant departments, from liberation to the end of last year, Shanghai's publishing houses published more than 27,900 new book titles, an increase of more than 7,000 titles compared to the total number of new books published across the country in the thirty years before liberation (according to materials from the "National Bibliography" published by Life Bookstore in 1935). In 1936, the year with the highest book publication volume before liberation, more than 178 million copies of books were published nationwide. However, last year alone, the number of books published in Shanghai exceeded that figure by about one and a half times, averaging 1.17 million copies per day.

In recent years, Shanghai's publishing houses, in coordination with the needs of national economic and cultural construction, have published a large number of popular reading materials suitable for the broad masses of workers and peasants. Popular theoretical readings published by the Shanghai People's Publishing House have been widely welcomed by readers, with the highest sales volume of books reaching approximately ten million copies. Last year, Shanghai's publishing houses published more than 90 million copies of social science, natural science, literature and art, and cultural and educational books. Many of these books, which have significant academic value, such as "Collected Papers on Chu Ci," "A Brief History of Chinese Celadon," and "Historical Materials on Ancient Chinese Mathematics," have received attention from people both at home and abroad.

In the past four years, the Juvenile and Children's Publishing House has published more than 1,700 types of books, totaling more than 150 million copies, exceeding the total number of books published by the Children's Bookstore in the twenty years before liberation. The publication of comic strips and New Year pictures has also greatly developed.

In the past, the organization of most publishing houses in Shanghai was unsound, and there were no editors within the companies. There was infighting and competition among businesses, and even speculation and profiteering. After liberation, the state transformed these publishing houses, merged them into eleven publishing institutions according to the principle of professional division of labor, and implemented planned publication. Each publishing house has established an editorial department and equipped it with specialized editorial talent.

    上海出版事业蓬勃发展
    据新华社上海14日电  新华社记者何国芳报道：上海解放八年来的出版事业，不是像某些右派分子所污蔑的“今不如昔”，而是有了蓬勃的发展。
    据有关方面统计，从解放后到去年年底为止，上海各出版社共出版了新书两万七千九百多种，比解放前三十年内全国各地印行的新书（根据生活书店1935年出版的“全国总书目”材料说明）增加了七千多种。解放前全国出书量最高的一年——1936年，全国共发行图书一亿七千八百多万册，但是，去年一年仅上海一地发行的图书，就比这个数字增加了约一倍半，平均每天出书一百一十七万册。
    几年来上海各出版社配合国家经济和文化建设的需要，出版了大量适合广大工农群众阅读的通俗读物。上海人民出版社出版的通俗理论读物，广泛受到读者欢迎，其中书籍销售量最高的达到一千万册左右。去年上海各出版社所出版的社会科学、自然科学以及文艺和文教图书，共九千多万册。其中许多具有重大学术价值的书籍如“楚辞论文集”、“中国青瓷史略”、“中国古代数学史料”等，都受到国内外人士的重视。
    少年儿童出版社四年多来出版了各类图书一千七百多种、一亿五千多万册，超出解放前儿童书局二十年内的出版图书总数。连环画和年画的出版工作也有很大发展。
    过去上海大部分出版社的组织不健全，社内没有编辑人员；同业间相互倾轧竞争，甚至投机倒把。解放后，国家对这些出版社进行了改造，根据专业分工方针，合并为十一个出版机构，并实行了出版物的计划化。各出版社都设立了编辑部，配备了专门编辑人材。
