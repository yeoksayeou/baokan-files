A Farm Producing Citronella
    Cun Hao
    Let the Coastal Wasteland Blossom and Bear Fruit

    At the tip of the Leizhou Peninsula, close to the northeast corner of the coast, there is a hilly area stretching for dozens of miles. The state-owned Hai'ou (Seagull) Farm is established on this grassland, which spans hundreds of miles.

    When the morning mist hangs over the earth, and the eastern horizon shows the dawn, groups of three or five agricultural workers, facing the fresh and humid sea breeze, begin a day of hard work. In the distance, tractors rumble rhythmically, ploughing out strips of brown-red new soil. Green citronella grass covers the slopes, appearing as large patches of brightly coloured felt; eucalyptus trees sway in the wind; and behind the groves, rows of grey-white new buildings are revealed. Looking at all this, who would have thought that a few years ago this was a desolate place covered with cogon grass!

    Speaking of southern China, one naturally thinks of the magnificent scenery of the tropics and subtropics. Dense palm trees, coconuts swaying in the gentle breeze, a climate like spring all year round… But here, the situation is different. There is a lack of forests, and not a single coconut tree can be seen... All that exists is cogon grass everywhere; one cannot find a single household for dozens of miles; and tigers, goats and orangutans often appear.

    Originally, the natural conditions here should be considered good. The coldest time of the year lasts only a few days, and there is plenty of rainfall. But the problem is that it doesn't rain for months at a time, and when it does, it is a torrential downpour, causing severe soil erosion. But after three days without rain, the ground becomes parched, and even the most drought-resistant plants cannot withstand it.

    Strong winds, barren land, disasters and difficulties – none of these have shaken the determination of the people to make this land blossom and bear fruit. Over the past few years, Hai'ou Farm has gained a foothold in this wilderness and grown stronger in the struggle against nature.

    Measures to fundamentally change the natural landscape are gradually being implemented. The total area of ​​protective forests, which began to be planted in 1952, has exceeded 15,000 mu, with two main forest belts, each more than ten miles long and eighty meters wide, forming the backbone of a criss-crossing protective forest network. Some trees already have towering canopies and lush branches, beginning to play a role in preventing wind and retaining water.

    Hai'ou Farm mainly plants citronella. Citronella grass is a perennial herb found in tropical and subtropical regions. It resembles cogon grass in shape, and its leaves have a rich fragrance. The citronella oil extracted after distillation can be used as a spice and has high economic value. Citronella is a fast-growing plant with strong tillering ability and high coverage, which is very effective in eliminating cogon grass. It also has the advantages of being drought-resistant, barren-resistant and wind-resistant. In the past few years, more than 20,000 mu of land in this farm have been successively planted with citronella grass. Along the well-connected farm roads, the green colour covers the mountains and slopes, setting off squares of eucalyptus forests. I couldn't help but recall what Farm Director Dong told me: "Turning cogon grass into citronella and grassland into forest is the ideal that all employees of the farm have always yearned for..." Judging from the current situation, this ideal is indeed getting closer day by day.

    Not more than eight miles from the location of the farm headquarters – Qujie Market – one can see from afar two tall chimneys that emit thick smoke day and night. This is the Second Citronella Processing Plant. It can process 150,000 catties of citronella grass every day, producing 1,500 catties of citronella oil. Speaking of the processing plant, one must mention Comrade Huang Abiao, a repair worker. In May and June of last year, the citronella was waiting to be harvested, but the existing processing equipment – the large steamer – could not hold it all, and the newly ordered equipment could not be allocated for a while. The farm director was anxious, and everyone was at a loss. Comrade Huang Abiao thought that the thickness of the pot iron was basically the same as that of the grease drums, and the farm had many grease drums in storage. Wouldn't it be good to convert them into steamers? He discussed this idea with the farm director, and the farm agreed to his suggestion, so he began to convert the drums into steamers. Huang Abiao created a wooden winch to flatten the grease drums, which greatly improved the efficiency of pot making. New processing plants were built in this way and put into production.

    As the planting area of citronella continues to expand, the farm is currently working on building three new types of steam furnace processing plants. These plants will be equipped with automatic conveying devices, which will not only reduce the physical labour of burning and moving grass, but also greatly improve the quantity and quality of the oil extracted. Once all put into production, the processing capacity and oil production will double.

    Before last year, Hai'ou Farm had no profits and relied on state investment every year. Only last year did it begin to turn around, handing over more than 30,000 yuan in profits for the whole year. This is a gratifying thing. The farm is now planning to purchase small-scale papermaking equipment, and preliminary experiments on using citronella residue to make paper have been successful. If the technology and equipment are further improved, there is great hope for producing newsprint. In this way, the more than 10,000 tons of citronella residue produced by the farm every year will find a better outlet. By solving this problem, the farm will increase a new source of income in the future.

    Life is Getting Better Day by Day

    Like the development of production, people's lives are also showing a thriving scene. After dusk, the wired broadcast plays melodious songs; young men who like to play ball are engaged in a fierce battle; mothers holding their children walk out of the nursery with smiles on their faces; and the library and club are crowded with young people who love literature, art and musical instruments...

    When the farm was first established in 1952, thirty or forty people were crammed into thatched huts without even a bed board. When a typhoon came, they were so worried that they could not sleep well. Today, more than 1,000 employees have moved into brick houses, and those who are married have also moved into single rooms. In addition to bed boards, tables and stools, households with more people are also equipped with a square table.

    In the Second Production Team, where I visited, there were a total of forty-eight workers. When they first entered the farm, most of them were single men, wearing ragged shirts and trousers, and carrying a mat or a piece of broken felt. Now, thirty-four people have started families on the farm. Each worker's income was only six jiao a day at the beginning. After 1953, they could earn at least one yuan. Now, the average monthly salary is thirty-six yuan, and some earn more than forty yuan. Many workers have bought leather suitcases, and everyone has quilts and mosquito nets. New shoes and new clothes are also bought in pairs and sets. Some workers with lighter burdens have bought bicycles. I went to the Third Production Group to visit Comrade Zhong Shanxin, who had created a method for accelerating the composting of citronella residue. He put down the tools he was repairing and told me kindly that in the old society, he worked for the landlord and only received a handful of grain a year; today, on the farm, he does not have to worry about food and clothing every month and can also send more than ten yuan home.

    Diligence and Thrift, Increase Production and Practice Economy

    People are increasingly clear about the future prospects, love their farm as they love their own home, and are determined to run the farm better through diligence and thrift.

    According to preliminary plans, in addition to handing over 300,000 yuan in profits this year, the farm also plans to increase production and save 570,000 yuan. "Saving all possible expenses and striving for a bumper harvest of citronella" is the slogan of action for every employee. February and March are the best seasons for farming. During these busy days, the weather is very cold, and it rains continuously, but in order to plant and harvest early and ensure a bumper harvest of citronella, cadres and workers alike brave the wind and rain to rush to plant. The Second Directly Subordinate Team is planting citronella for the first time this year, and the efficiency was very low at the beginning. Each worker could only plant more than 1,000 plants a day. This would affect the rush planting and increase costs. After repeated research, everyone decided to adopt the method of placing fertilizer and seedlings separately and dividing the work according to each person's expertise. This immediately increased the efficiency to more than 6,000 on average, making it the team with the highest planting efficiency in the entire farm in February. When planting citronella, the seedlings must be treated and transplanted. In the past, the management of transplanting was not good enough, and the roots did not sprout neatly, resulting in a lot of waste when selecting seedlings for planting. This time, the team paid attention to adopting the method of mixing soil with sand and controlling moisture, so that most of the seedlings sprouted neatly and grew well. In production, the biggest problem is the lack of fertilizer. Workers from the Second Group of the Second Directly Subordinate Team used their spare time to cut grass and spread the grass in the pigsty. They could produce grass twice a month, each time producing more than 10,000 catties. Now they no longer worry about the lack of fertilizer and are even confident that they can solve the problem for the first season of next year.

    Comrade Zhang Focai is the deputy director of the Second Processing Plant. The distilled water in the cooling pipe flows out day and night. He discovered that the wastewater flowing into the pool after citronella processing still contained a lot of oil, which was a pity, so he tried to concentrate and filter it. In three and a half days, he collected one and a half catties of citronella oil. It is estimated that just this little thing can increase production by more than 500 yuan a year.

    一个生产香茅的农场
    存豪
    让海滨荒原开花结果
    在雷州半岛的顶端，紧靠东北角的海边上，有一块绵延几十里的丘陵地带。国营海鸥农场，就建立在这方圆百十里的草原上。
    当清晨的薄雾迷漫着大地，东方天际呈现曙光的时候，三、五一伙的农业工人，迎着清新湿润的海风，开始了一天辛勤的劳动。远处拖拉机有节奏地轰鸣着，犁铧翻滚出一条条棕红色的新土。坡上坡下绿油油的香茅草，远望黄绿交映，像似一大块一大块色彩鲜艳的毛毡；桉树迎风飘摇；树丛后露出一栋栋灰白色的新建筑。看着眼前这一切，谁能想到几年前这里还是个茅草遍地的荒凉地方呢！
    一提起祖国的南方，很自然会想起一幅热带、亚热带的绮丽风光。茂密浓郁的棕榈树，轻风中摇拽的椰子，四季如春的气候……。可在这里，情况却不一样，既缺少森林，也看不到一棵椰子树……有的，只是到处一片茅草；几十里路碰不到一户人家；老虎、山羊、黄猩经常出没。
    本来这儿的自然条件应该算是不错的，一年最冷的时候只有几天，雨水也不少。但问题是，不下雨几个月都不下，下起来就是一阵暴雨，土壤冲刷很厉害，可是三天不下雨，地里就干巴巴的，再耐旱的东西也抗不了。
    风大、地荒、灾害和困难多，这些都没有动摇了要使这块土地开花结果的人们的决心。几年来，海鸥农场在这块荒原上站住了脚根，在和自然斗争中成长了起来。
    从根本上改变自然面貌的措施，正在逐步实现。自1952年起营造的防护林，总面积已有一万五千多亩，以二条长十多里、宽八十公尺的基干林为骨干，形成了纵横交错的防护林网。有些树已经是树冠高耸，枝叶茂密，开始起着防风保水的作用。
    海鸥农场以种植香茅为主。香茅草是热带、亚热带地区的一种多年生的草本植物，形状很像茅草，它的叶子里有一股浓郁的香味，蒸馏后提炼的香茅油，可供作香料，经济价值很高。香茅这种植物生势快，分蘖力强，复盖度大，对消灭茅草有很大作用；它还有耐旱耐瘠，不怕刮风的优点。几年来，这个农场已有二万多亩地，陆续种上了香茅草。沿着四通八达的场间道路，满山满坡青绿一片，衬托着一方格一方格的桉树林。我不禁想起董场长向我讲的：“茅草变香茅，草原变森林，是全场职工一直向往着的理想……。”照眼前的情况来看，这个理想的的确确一天比一天接近了。
    离场部所在地——曲界墟——不过八里多地的样子，老远就可以看到，高高耸立的白天黑夜吐着浓烟的二条大烟筒，这就是第二香茅加工厂。它每天能够加工香茅草十五万斤，可产香芳油一千五百斤。提起加工厂，不能不提一提修配工黄阿标同志。去年5、6月间，香茅等着收割，可是，现有的加工设备——大蒸锅容纳不下，新定购的设备一时又调拨不来，场长着急，大家也没办法。黄阿标同志想，锅铁的厚度基本上和黄油桶的差不多，黄油桶场里存的很多，改作蒸锅不是很好吗？他把这个意见向场长谈了一下，场里同意了他的建议，就开始改制起蒸锅。黄阿标创造了个木头绞车来压平黄油桶，大大提高了制锅的效率。一座座新的加工厂就是这样建设起来，投入了生产。
    由于香茅的种植面积越来越扩大，眼前场里正着手增建三座新型的蒸汽炉加工厂，在这几个厂里将设有自动传送装置，不但减轻烧火、搬草的体力劳动，提炼出来的油的数量和质量也会大大提高。全部投入生产后，加工能力和产油量将要提高一倍。
    海鸥农场去年以前，年年无利，年年靠国家投资，去年起才有了转变，全年上交利润是三万多元。这是件可喜的事。农场现在筹划购置小型的造纸设备，利用香茅渣造纸的初步试验已经成功。假如技术装备再改进些，出产新闻纸大有希望。这样，全场每年生产下来的一万多吨的香茅渣，就找到了更好的出路，解决了这个问题，农场今后将增加一笔新的收入。
    日子一天比一天美好
    同生产的发展一样，人们的生活也呈现欣欣向荣的景象。黄昏以后，有线广播响起悠扬的歌声；喜欢打球的小伙子，进行着一场激烈的战斗；做母亲的抱着自己的孩子，笑呵呵的从托儿所里走出来；在图书室和俱乐部里，来来往往挤满了爱好文艺和乐器的年轻人……。
    1952年刚建场的时候，三、四十个人挤住在连块铺板都没有的茅草房里，台风一来，提心吊胆连觉都睡不好，今天，一千多名职工多已搬进了砖瓦房，结了婚的也都住上了单间，室内设备，除铺板、桌、凳外，人口多的户还配一张四方台。
    在我到过的第二生产队里，一共有四十八名工人，刚进场时，大多数都是单身汉，穿一身破衫裤，夹一领席或一块破毡子。现在，已有三十四个人在场里成了家。每个工人的收入，开始一天只有六角钱，1953年以后，最少可拿一块钱；现在一般每个月的工资是三十六元，高的还有四十多元的。很多工人都置了皮箱，每人都有了被子和蚊帐，新鞋、新衣服也都是成双成件的。有些负担比较轻的工人，买了脚踏车。我到第三生产组去访问了曾经创造香茅渣加速腐熟方法的钟善新同志，他放下正在手里修整的工具，亲切地告诉我，在旧社会，他给地主打工，一年只拿石把谷；今天在农场，每月吃穿不愁，还可以寄回家十多块钱。
    克勤克俭，增产节约
    人们愈来愈清楚地看到未来的远景，像爱自己家一样热爱自己的农场，下决心要克勤克俭地把场办的更好。
    按初步计划，农场今年除上交利润三十万元外，另准备增产节约五十七万元。“节省一切可能节省的开支，千方百计争取香茅大丰收。”这是每个职工的行动口号。2、3月，正是最好的农事季节。在这紧张的日子里，天很冷，雨淅沥沥不间断的下，但为了早种早割，保证香茅丰产，不分干部和工人，都顶着风雨投入抢种。第二直属队，今年头一次种香茅，开始效率很低，一个工一天只种一千多株，这样，抢种会受影响，成本也要提高，经过大家再三研究，决定采取分散放置肥料和种苗，按各人专长分工的办法。这一下，效率平均提高到六千多，成为2月份全场种植效率最高的一个队。种香茅，种苗一定要进行处理和假植，过去在假植当中，管理搞的不够好，根部出茎很不整齐，选苗种植时候浪费很大，这次队里都注意采取土壤掺沙，以及控制水份的办法，多数做到出茎整齐枝枝上山。在生产当中，最大的问题是肥料缺乏，二直属队二组的工人利用业余时间割草，把草铺到猪舍里去，一个月可出二次草，每次都能起一万多斤，现在他们不再发愁肥料不够，而且连明年第一季的也有把握解决。
    张佛才同志是第二加工厂的副厂长，冷却管里的蒸馏水日夜不断的向外流，他发现香芳加工以后，流到水池里的废水，都还含有不少的油质，很可惜，就试着进行集中过滤，三天半就集聚了一斤半的香茅油，估计就这么一点小事，一年也可以增产五百多元。
