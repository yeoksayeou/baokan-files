Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Manama dispatch: According to an Omani war communiqué released by the British official, Omani insurgents used automatic weapons and rifles to fight against the British offensive forces in Firq on the evening of August 8. Firq is about five miles from Nizwa, the headquarters of the insurgents.

According to preliminary reports, Omani insurgent snipers killed one and wounded six Trucial Oman Scouts. In this offensive, commanded by British Brigadier Robertson, Trucial Oman Scouts were assigned to act as advance troops, with British troops in the rear using heavy machine guns and mortars.

The British military action to suppress the Omani uprising is taking a pincer offensive, attacking Nizwa from the north and south. The main group of troops is the southern force departing from the Faud base. They encountered no resistance along the way, but were resisted by Omani insurgents when they arrived at Firq on August 8.

Another route started from Muscat, the capital of the Sultanate of Muscat, and it was announced that they had occupied Izki, thirty miles east of Nizwa, today.

The British offensive forces have always been covered by the British Air Force.

According to a broadcast from Cairo Radio on the evening of August 8, part of the Muscat Sultan’s troops mutinied on August 8 and refused to fight the Omani insurgents. Cairo Radio said that the mutiny took place in the Sharika, Bayd, Muscat, and Khor al Fakkan areas, and later spread to other areas.

According to a report from the Middle East News Agency: Omani Imam Ghalib bin Ali announced that Omani nationalists are firmly defending their positions in the face of British aggressors, and will not implement a ceasefire until the aggressors recognize the complete independence of Oman, which they have recognized in past treaties.

He said that Oman needs all kinds of active assistance in the cruel struggle against imperialist forces. Oman also hopes to receive the support of Arab countries and people all over the world who uphold freedom, justice, and peace.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: The Political Committee of the Arab League held a meeting in Cairo at noon on August 8 to discuss the situation in Oman.

The committee discussed whether to submit the Oman incident to the United Nations Security Council. After the discussion, the committee decided to adjourn temporarily and hold another meeting on August 10, so that representatives of various countries would have time to obtain further instructions from their governments. The Omani Imam's representative in Cairo, Harsai, will be invited to attend the meeting on August 10 to explain the situation in Oman and the latest developments.

Yemeni Envoy to Egypt, Taleb, told representatives of various countries at the meeting on the 8th that Britain’s new aggressive actions against Yemen are closely related to the armed offensive against Oman, and this is part of Britain’s full-scale offensive against southern Arabia.

Because Jordan did not send a representative to the meeting, the Secretary-General of the Arab League telegraphed the Jordanian Foreign Minister after the meeting, informing him of the meeting and requesting Jordan to send a representative to participate in the meeting on August 10.

    阿曼起义者抗击英国侵略军
    阿拉伯联盟政治委员会讨论阿曼局势
    新华社9日讯　马纳马消息：据英国官方发布的阿曼战况公报，阿曼起义者8月8日晚上在菲尔克以自动武器和步枪抗击英国的进攻部队。菲尔克距离起义者总部所在地尼兹瓦约五英里。
    据初步报告，阿曼起义者的狙击手共打死一名、打伤六名特鲁西尔阿曼侦察兵。在由英国罗伯逊准将指挥的这次进攻中，特鲁西尔阿曼侦察兵被分配充当前锋部队，英国人部队以重机枪和迫击炮等殿后。
    英国这次镇压阿曼起义者的军事行动是采取钳形攻势，分南北两路进攻尼兹瓦的。主要的一批部队是从法乌德基地出发的南路部队，他们一路上未遇抵抗，但在8月8日到达菲尔克时却受到阿曼起义者的抗击。
    另一路是从马斯喀特苏丹国首都马斯喀特出发的，据宣布，他们已经在今天占领了尼兹瓦东面三十英里的伊兹基。
    英国的进攻部队一直都受到英国空军的掩护。
    据开罗电台8月8日晚上广播，马斯喀特苏丹的一部分部队在8月8日实行叛变，拒绝去打阿曼起义者。开罗电台说，这次叛变发生在沙里卡、巴伊德、马斯喀特和赫马角地区，而且后来还蔓延到其他地区。
    另据中东通讯社消息：阿曼教长加勒布·本·阿里宣布，阿曼民族主义者正在英国侵略者面前坚守他们的阵地，在侵略者承认他们过去在条约中已经承认的阿曼完全独立以前，不会实行停火。
    他说，阿曼在反对帝国主义势力的残酷的斗争中需要每一种积极的援助。阿曼还希望得到阿拉伯国家的支持和全世界维护自由、正义和和平的人们的支持。
    据新华社9日讯　阿拉伯联盟政治委员会8月8日中午在开罗举行会议，讨论阿曼局势。
    委员会讨论了是否要把阿曼事件向联合国安全理事会提出的问题。在讨论以后，委员会决定暂时休会，到8月10日再举行会议，以便让各国代表有时间从本国政府得到进一步的指示。阿曼教长驻开罗代表哈尔赛将被邀请列席8月10日的会议，以便解释阿曼的情况和最近的局势发展。
    也门驻埃及公使塔列布在8日的会议上对各国代表说，英国对也门的新的侵略行动是同对阿曼的武装进攻密切关连的，这是英国对阿拉伯南部发动全面攻势的一部分。
    因为约旦没有派代表出席这次会议，阿拉伯联盟秘书长在会后打电报给约旦外交大臣，告诉他关于会议的情况，并且要求约旦派代表参加8月10日的会议。
