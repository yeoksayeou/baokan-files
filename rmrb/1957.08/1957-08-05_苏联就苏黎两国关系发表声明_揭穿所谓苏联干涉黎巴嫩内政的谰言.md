Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 3rd: According to TASS, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Semyonov recently met with Lebanese Minister to Moscow, Najjar, and presented him with an oral statement regarding Soviet-Lebanese relations.

Semyonov said that on June 11th of this year, the Soviet Ambassador to Lebanon delivered a statement to the Lebanese Foreign Minister. The Soviet government issued this statement because some Lebanese newspapers (including those close to the government) published slanders fabricating Soviet interference in Lebanese internal affairs. However, these fabrications were not refuted by the Lebanese government. Not only that, but Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik actually supported these fabrications and suggested that the Soviet government "restrain" certain Lebanese individuals who, according to him, were "engaged" in "propaganda" against the policies of the Lebanese government.

Therefore, the Soviet government found it necessary to clearly explain the Soviet Union's friendly policy towards Lebanon and its strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in Lebanese internal affairs. The content of the aforementioned statement issued by the Soviet government expressed a friendly attitude towards Lebanon. The statement emphasized that the Soviet government is willing to maintain friendly relations with all Arab countries, including Lebanon; the Soviet people highly value the traditional friendship with the Lebanese people that has existed for a long time, and fully understand the aspirations of Lebanon and other Arab countries to fight for their national independence and national sovereignty.

In the statement, the Soviet government once again reiterated one of the basic principles of its foreign policy – that one country is not allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of another country.

However, it must be stated with regret that, according to the memorandum that the Lebanese government handed to the Soviet ambassador on June 24th, the Lebanese government has a certain misunderstanding of the Soviet government's actions. Moreover, the Lebanese government, in its memorandum, indirectly expressed a prejudice that the Soviet Union can interfere in Lebanon's domestic socio-political life and meddle in the activities of those who oppose the Lebanese government, while in fact, Lebanon's socio-political life is an internal matter for Lebanon.

The Lebanese government, in its memorandum, believed that the Soviet Union's criticism of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" might have the purpose of interfering in Lebanon's foreign policy. Obviously, this is due to some misunderstanding. It cannot be considered that the Soviet Union's expression of its views on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and on certain countries' acceptance of this doctrine constitutes interference in the foreign policy of these countries.

Semyonov finally told the minister that the Soviet government still believes that there is a suitable basis for further developing friendly relations between our two countries, and believes that Lebanon, like the Soviet Union, hopes to develop such relations. The Soviet government hopes that the Lebanese government can correctly understand the Soviet Union's position on this issue.

### 苏联就苏黎两国关系发表声明  揭穿所谓苏联干涉黎巴嫩内政的谰言

    苏联就苏黎两国关系发表声明
    揭穿所谓苏联干涉黎巴嫩内政的谰言
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联外交部副部长谢苗诺夫最近接见了黎巴嫩驻莫斯科公使纳贾尔，就苏黎两国关系问题向这位公使提出了一项口头声明。
    谢苗诺夫说，今年6月11日苏联驻黎巴嫩大使曾经交给黎巴嫩外交部长一项声明，苏联政府提出这项声明的原因是，有些黎巴嫩的报纸（包括接近政府的报纸）上出现了捏造苏联干涉黎巴嫩内政的谰言。但是，这些捏造却没有受到黎巴嫩政府的驳斥。不但如此，黎巴嫩外交部长马利克实际上还支持这种捏造，并建议苏联政府“约制”黎巴嫩的这样一些人，据他说，这些人正在“从事”反对黎巴嫩政府政策的“宣传”。
    因此，苏联政府有必要把苏联对黎巴嫩的友好政策以及苏联严格遵守不干涉黎巴嫩内政的原则解释清楚，苏联政府为此而发表的上述声明的内容，表现了对黎巴嫩的友好态度。声明强调指出，苏联政府愿意保持同所有阿拉伯国家（其中包括黎巴嫩）的友好关系；苏联人民对很久以来就存在的同黎巴嫩人民的传统友谊给予崇高的评价，并且完全了解为自己的民族独立和国家主权而斗争的黎巴嫩和其它阿拉伯国家的愿望。
    苏联政府在声明中又一次重申了它的对外政策的基本原则之一——不允许一国干涉另一国内政。
    但是，不得不遗憾地指出，根据黎巴嫩政府6月24日交给苏联大使的意见书看来，黎巴嫩政府对苏联政府的作法有某种误解。而且，黎巴嫩政府在它的意见书中又间接地表露出这样一个偏见，似乎苏联可以干预黎巴嫩国内的社会政治生活，过问那些反对黎巴嫩政府的人的活动，而其实黎巴嫩的社会政治生活是黎巴嫩的内部的事情。
    黎巴嫩政府在它的意见书中曾经认为苏联对于“艾森豪威尔主义”的批评，可能具有干涉黎巴嫩外交政策的目的，很明显，这是出于某种误会。不能认为，苏联对“艾森豪威尔主义”以及对某些国家接受这个主义表示自己的看法，就带有干涉这些国家的外交政策的性质。
    谢苗诺夫最后告诉公使说，苏联政府仍然认为，进一步发展我们两国之间友好关系的适当基础还是存在的，并且认为黎巴嫩也和苏联一样希望发展这种关系。苏联政府希望黎巴嫩政府能够正确地了解苏联在这个问题上的立场。
