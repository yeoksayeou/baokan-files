Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 1st: Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's talk with Japanese journalists on July 25th has attracted the attention of the Japanese public. The Japanese Diet, currently in recess, held a meeting of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on July 31st at the request of the Japan Socialist Party. At the meeting, Diet members questioned Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke and others on issues such as Sino-Japanese relations.

In his response, Kishi Nobusuke stated that he himself is "anti-communist." He said, "The accusation that we are taking an anti-communist line under pressure from the United States is inappropriate." He said that Japan is a "free and democratic country," and therefore his foreign policy is to "join hands with other democratic countries to jointly build world peace."

Kishi Nobusuke deliberately provoked, saying, "In my opinion, the accusations of Communist China, if not out of misunderstanding, can only be considered to have ulterior motives."

Kishi Nobusuke slanderously said that in Japan, the "danger" of Chinese "infiltration" and "subversive activities" is much greater than in other countries.

Kishi Nobusuke also said that regarding the issue of whether to politically recognize China, "we have different views from some United Nations members," but we still want to conduct economic, trade, and cultural exchanges with China, and our thinking on this point has not changed.

At the afternoon meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, Socialist Party members continued to question the issue of recognizing China. Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama said in his response that the time for recognizing China "cannot be disclosed." He also said that regarding the issue of Chinese trade representatives being fingerprinted, this is not just a matter relating to China alone, so "it would not be good to change it rashly."

    日本议员就中日关系提出质询
    岸信介毫不掩饰反共立场
    无中生有说日本受到中国的威胁
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：中国周恩来总理7月25日对日本记者的谈话，引起了日本公众的重视。正在休会期间的日本国会，根据日本社会党的要求，在7月31日举行了众议院外务委员会会议。议员们在会上就中日关系等问题向首相岸信介等提出质询。
    岸信介在答辩时表示，他自己就是“反共”的。他说，“说我们是受了美国的压力才提出反共路线，这样的责备是不恰当的。”他说，日本是一个“自由民主的国家”，因此，他的外交政策是“同其他民主国家携手，共同缔造世界和平”。
    岸信介故意挑拨地说，“我看，共产党中国的责备，如果不是出于误解，只能认为是别有用心。”
    岸信介诬蔑说，在日本，中国“渗入”和“进行颠覆活动”的“危险”比在其他国家都大得多。
    岸信介又说，关于是否要在政治上承认中国这一问题，“我们同一部分联合国会员国有不同的看法”，不过我们仍然要同中国进行经济、贸易、文化等方面的交流，在这一点上我们的想法没有改变。
    在昨天外务委员会的下午会议上，社会党议员继续就承认中国的问题提出质询。外务相藤山爱一郎在答复的时候说，承认中国的时间“不能奉告”。他又说，关于中国贸易代表按指纹的问题，这不单是关系中国一个国家的问题，所以“轻率地加以改变是不好的”。
