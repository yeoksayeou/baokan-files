Xinhua News Agency report: The staff of the Ministry of Health are engaged in verbal and written battles against rightists. Over the past month, through numerous debates, criticism sessions, and walls covered with big-character posters, the crimes of a group of rightists have begun to be exposed. They are: Hu Shangyi, from a large merchant family and a former member of the Kuomintang; Wang Shijin, a member of the Jiu San Society; Jia Kui, from a landlord family and a former executive committee member and secretary of the Kuomintang district party headquarters; Jia Weilian, from a landlord family and a former member of Chen Guofu's China Education Society, a special agent of the Kuomintang; Jiang Shangfeng, a central solidarity committee member of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee and a former official in the Kuomintang health agencies; and others.

From the materials revealed by the masses, it can be seen that these rightists are birds of a feather. They unanimously oppose the Party's leadership over health work, negate the achievements of the Party in leading the health cause, and insist that the health work during the Kuomintang era was better and more scientific than it is now. For example, at a meeting for soliciting opinions on the work of the Ministry of Health, Jia Kui, when attacking the leaders of the Ministry of Health, even made the outrageous statement that they "should be asked to resign or commit collective suicide," a statement full of class hatred. They also hate Party members, nitpicking on Party members' minor shortcomings and exaggerating them to undermine the relationship between the Party and the masses. For example, Jia Weilian maliciously fabricated rumors, saying that "Party members have the power of life and death," and Hu Shangyi insulted Party members by saying: "With Party membership, you can be guaranteed for life, you don't need to study your work, you can lie down and sleep on socialism." Wang Shijin said: "Okay, everyone joins the Party, and no one does any concrete work," intending to slander Party members as not doing any concrete work. Like the general rightists in society, these rightists dislike the new society and the socialist system because their bourgeois selfishness and personal ambitions are not currently being satisfied. They oppose the Party's various policies, slander the movements such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and ideological remolding, and oppose the anti-rightist struggle.

At the symposium on the criticism of Wang Shijin held by the Department of Maternal and Child Health on the 16th, Fan Wenying, who had worked in the National Health Administration of the Kuomintang Executive Yuan, cited her personal experiences to refute the insults of Wang Shijin and other rightists against the leadership of the Communist Party and the health cause of new China. When talking about the contrast between health work in the old and new China, Fan Wenying said: Before liberation, flies and mosquitoes filled the sky in the cities, and even the Kuomintang Health Administration's own offices were like that; in the countryside, there were only a few key rural health experimental zones, which were specially for foreigners to visit. After liberation, the health work led by the Communist Party is vastly different from the past and cannot be compared.

Some comrades have powerfully refuted the fallacies of the rightists who believe that the current health work is "lacking statistical figures and unscientific" everywhere. Critics cited the Patriotic Health Campaign as an example. It is clear that there were so many mosquitoes and flies in the past, and now there are almost no mosquitoes and flies in many places, which even surprises foreigners, but the rightist Wang Shijin believes that without statistical figures, it cannot be said that the Patriotic Health Campaign is scientific; for example, the rate of tetanus in newborns has indeed been greatly reduced, and the health departments have trained more than 570,000 new-method midwives, which is an ironclad fact, but the rightists insist that "there is no evidence," thus negating the achievements of maternal and child health work; during the Kuomintang era, vaccination certificates could be bought with money or obtained through personal connections, can such false statistics explain "science" and "achievements"?

The anti-rightist struggle in the Ministry of Health is developing towards Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and the criticism of other rightists will begin successively.

    卫生部反右派斗争向广深方面发展
    一批右派分子罪行开始暴露
    据新华社讯　卫生部工作人员舌战笔战右派分子。一个月来，经过大大小小的辩论、批评会和满墙满壁的大字报，一批右派分子的罪行开始暴露。他们是：出身大奸商家庭、曾经参加过国民党的胡尚一，九三学社社员王诗锦，出身地主家庭、曾任国民党区党部执行委员兼书记的贾魁，出身地主家庭、曾经参加过国民党特务头子陈果夫的中国教育社的贾伟廉，国民党革命委员会中央团结委员、曾在国民党卫生机关担任过职务的江上峰，等等。
    从群众揭发的材料可以看出，这些右派分子是一丘之貉，他们异口同声地反对党对卫生工作的领导，否定党领导卫生事业的成就，硬说国民党时代的卫生事业比现在好，比现在科学。例如贾魁在一次对卫生部工作提意见的会上在攻击卫生部领导人员时，竟提出“应请他们辞职，或者集体自杀”那样充满阶级仇恨的狂言。他们还仇视党员，百般挑剔党员小毛病并加以夸张渲染，破坏党群关系。例如贾伟廉恶毒地造谣说“党员有生杀予夺之大权”，胡尚一污辱党员时说：“有了党籍，就可以保证一辈子，可以不钻研工作，躺在社会主义上睡觉。”王诗锦说：“好吧，一个个的都入了党，没有人作具体工作了。”意在诬蔑党员都是不做具体工作的。这些右派分子同社会上一般右派分子一样，由于他们的资产阶级自私自利和个人野心现在得不到满足而厌恶新社会和社会主义制度，反对党的各项政策，污蔑肃反、思想改造等运动，反对反右派斗争。
    在16日妇幼卫生司批判王诗锦的座谈会上，曾经在国民党行政院卫生署任职的范文滢历举亲身经历的事实驳斥了王诗锦等右派分子对共产党的领导、对新中国的卫生事业的污辱。说到新旧中国卫生工作的对比时，范文滢说：解放前，在城市中是苍蝇蚊虫满天飞，国民党卫生署自己的办公室中也是这样；乡村中只有几个重点的乡村卫生实验区，是专门让外国人参观的。解放后，共产党领导的卫生工作和过去相比，真是天地般的悬殊，不能比拟。
    有些同志对右派分子认为现在的卫生工作处处“没有统计数字、不科学”等谬论作了有力的驳斥。批评者举爱国卫生运动为例，明明过去蚊蝇那么多，而现在许多地方几乎没有蚊蝇，连外国人看了也惊异，但右派分子王诗锦却认为没有统计数字，就说爱国卫生运动没有科学性；又如现在新生儿患破伤风的比率确实大为降低，卫生部门培养了五十七万多新法接生员，这是铁的事实，而右派分子硬说“没有证据”，因而否定妇幼卫生工作的成绩；国民党时代打防疫针的证明书可以用钱购买、靠交情获得，这样的假统计能说明“科学”和“成绩”吗？
    卫生部的反右派斗争正在向广、深方面发展，对其他右派分子的批判即将陆续开始。
