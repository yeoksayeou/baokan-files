　　Compare, Calculate, Think, Look
　　In the Great Drought of 1942, how many families were torn apart and lost their lives?
    After 1954, why were we able to smoothly overcome the three years of famine?
　　Hebei Cang County
    At the county-level, district-level, township-level, and commune-level cadre conference held by the Cang County Party Committee in Hebei, a great debate was launched on the question of "Is the unified purchase and sale of grain good?" During the great debate, everyone recalled: Before liberation, most people in Cang County lived on a diet of chaff and vegetables for half the year. Grain was in the hands of landlords, rich peasants, and grain merchants. They hoarded and speculated, manipulating grain prices. Grain prices were low at harvest time, but soared when the harvest was lean. Borrowing one *dou* of coarse grain before the wheat harvest required repaying two *dou* of wheat after the harvest; borrowing one *dou* of wheat before the autumn harvest required repaying three *dou* of coarse grain after the harvest. Farmers toiled all year but still couldn't repay their debts. In years of disaster, there was even less chance for peasants to survive. Grain prices changed eight times a day; the saying went, "Even a good horse can't catch up with rising grain prices." Many people were forced to flee famine, families were torn apart, fortunes were lost, and some even starved to death by the roadside. In Zhangguantun Township, during the great drought of 1942, forty-one households were forced to sell their children, thirty-one couples tearfully separated, and twenty-one people starved to death. Li Zhenlin, the production team leader, had five brothers, three of whom starved to death, while the landlord's big yellow dog was fat and healthy.
    During the discussion, the more people recalled, the more heartbroken they became. The hatred for the old society formed an unstoppable torrent, and many people couldn't help but cry. Li Zhenlin angrily said, "Anyone who says unified purchase and sale is not good has no conscience! Anyone who opposes unified purchase and sale and wants us to return to the old society is our enemy, and we will fight them to the end!" Li Zhenlin wiped away his tears and said, "I will never forget the Communist Party's kindness and the benefits of unified purchase and sale. If it weren't for the Communist Party's leadership in implementing unified purchase and sale of grain, during these three consecutive years of disaster, we wouldn't have been able to eat even chaff, let alone grain, and our families would have been ruined long ago!" He also examined his own erroneous thinking of concealing 1,700 *jin* of wheat, saying that he was truly letting down the country.
    While recalling the past, everyone calculated the following: How did we overcome the three consecutive years of disaster from 1954 to the present? Cang County has historically been prone to disasters, with annual production consistently falling short of sales. Since the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain in 1954, we have suffered from floods and waterlogging for three consecutive years. During these difficult years, the state guaranteed supplies, and not only did no one starve to death in the county, but very few people had to eat chaff and vegetables. Cadres thought about the past and compared it to the present, deeply realizing that the state and the masses are of one life and one heart. Many cadres discussed:
  "If the state hadn't implemented unified purchase and sale, obtaining grain from surplus areas to supply us, many of our families would not have survived the major disasters of 1954 and 1956. As a result, many people underwent intense ideological struggles. Some said, if we are not loyal to the country and don't sell our surplus grain, how can we ask the state for help when we are short of grain? What if we have another disaster? Besides, when we were in difficulty, farmers from brother provinces transported grain for us through hardship and across mountains and rivers. Now that we have surplus grain, shouldn't we sell it to the state to help our suffering farmer brothers? Many cadres, based on the discussions at the meeting, examined their own selfish and self-serving thoughts and felt very ashamed. As a result, they exposed erroneous behaviors such as hoarding, concealing production, and over-reporting the population. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 1,212,000 *jin* of concealed grain was exposed on the spot; each production team made plans to conserve grain, reasonably reduce consumption quotas, and reduce the state's unified sales volume by 5,700,000 *jin*.

　　比比·算算·想想·看看
　　1942年大旱，多少人家妻离子散家破人亡？
    1954年以后，为什么能顺利渡过三年灾荒？
　　河北沧县
    河北沧县县委召开的县、区、乡、社干部大会上，曾经展开“粮食统购统销好不好”的大辩论。在大辩论中，大家回忆：解放以前，沧县大多数的人是糠菜半年粮。粮食掌握在地主、富农和粮食商人手里。他们囤积居奇，操纵粮价。收获时粮价贱，青黄不接时一涨千丈，麦前借一斗粗粮，麦后还二斗小麦，秋前借一斗小麦，秋后还三斗粗粮。农民辛苦一年还不够还债的。遇到灾年更是没有庄稼人的活路。粮价一天八变，所谓“好马赶不上粮价涨”。很多人因吃不到粮食而逃荒、妻离子散，倾家荡产，甚至饿死路旁。张官屯乡，在1942年大旱的时候，全乡有四十一户被迫卖掉儿女，三十一户夫妻痛哭离散，并有二十一人活活饿死了。生产队长李振林弟兄五个，饿死了三个，而地主的大黄狗则是肥肥的。
    讨论当中人们越回想越伤心，对旧社会的仇恨，形成了一支不可阻挡的巨流，很多人止不住哭了。李振林气愤的说：“谁说统购统销不好，谁就没良心！谁反对统购统销，想让我们退到旧社会去，谁就是我们的对头，坚决和他干到底！”李振林擦了擦眼泪又说：“我一辈子也忘不了共产党的恩情和统购统销的好处，要不是共产党领导实行了粮食统购统销，这一连三年遭灾，别说粮食，就连糠也吃不上，早就家破人亡了！”他并检查了自己隐瞒了一千七百斤小麦的错误思想，说他实在对不起国家。
    大家一面回忆一面算了这样一笔账：从1954年到现在，怎样渡过了一连三年的灾荒的？沧县历史上多灾，年年产不足销。从1954年实行了粮食统购统销以来，三年连续遭到洪沥水灾。在困难的年月里，国家保证了供应，全县不仅没有发生饿死人的事件，且吃糠咽菜的也很少了。干部们想想从前，比比现在，深深认识到了国家和群众是一条命，一条心。很多干部议论：
  “要不是国家实行统购统销，从丰收区取得了粮食，供应我们，像1954年和1956年那样的大灾，我们许多人家无论如何是过不来的。于是，许多人思想上起了激烈的斗争。有的说，如果我们对国家不忠诚，有余粮不卖，到缺粮的时候怎么伸手向国家要？如果再闹了灾荒又怎么办？再说我们困难的时候，兄弟省农民千辛万苦、千山万水地为我们运了粮来，现在我们有了余粮，还不应该卖给国家救救在苦难中的农民弟兄吗？很多干部根据会上的讨论，对照了自己自私自利思想，感到十分羞愧，于是纷纷揭露了多留、瞒产、多报人口等错误行为。据不完全统计，当场揭露瞒报的粮食共一百二十一万二千多斤；各生产队作出节约用粮计划，合理压缩消费指标，减少国家统销量五百七十万斤。
