Who says the countryside doesn't have enough grain to eat?

Editor's Note: Some people are constantly complaining: "There isn't enough grain left for the peasants to eat!" or "There isn't enough grain supplied to grain-deficient households!" Is it really enough or not? In many rural areas, this question is being discussed or has already been discussed in the great debates. Facts prove that the vast majority of people who claim to "not have enough to eat" actually have enough or even surplus grain left or supplied. Here are some examples.

The Secret of "Grain-Deficient Households"

This spring, township and commune cadres in Hexin Township, Changsha County, Hunan Province, were greatly troubled by the fact that some people were shouting about grain shortages. It was clear that enough grain rations had been left during the unified purchase and sale last year, but some people were still shouting about grain shortages, and a few of them were making such a fuss that they couldn't concentrate on production and work. "Why are they shouting about grain shortages? Are they really short of grain?" Recently, after the township launched a socialist propaganda and education campaign, the masses revealed a large number of facts, proving that the people who had made the biggest fuss about grain shortages in the past were those who had surplus grain at home.

Here are just two examples:

Li Zhaokui, a landlord from Longtan Cooperative, was admitted into the cooperative this spring and his production was managed by the agricultural cooperative. He worked individually last year, and his grain rations were slightly more than those of the cooperative members. But from the beginning of this spring, he started looking for cadres, demanding that the state supply him with more grain. When the cadres refused, Li Zhaokui wouldn't give up. Until the early rice harvest, he had approached the cadres thirty-four times, each time arguing about grain. He used "grain shortage" as an excuse not to work and even roped in several cooperative members to go out and do business during the busy farming season. As soon as the new grain was harvested, he borrowed new rice from other families to eat, indicating that he was truly short of grain. In this campaign to counter the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and remaining counter-revolutionaries in Hexin Township, Li Zhaokui's neighbors revealed that this Li Zhaokui, who had always shouted about "grain shortage," still had 120 jin of old grain, more than 10 jin of glutinous rice, and 25 jin of moldy buckwheat hidden at home.

Fang Haiqing, a member of the Qunli Cooperative, was also very vocal about "grain shortage" this year. He would curse the cadres as soon as he saw them, claiming that "it won't work if you don't get grain." During the early rice harvest, he even used "grain shortage" as an excuse to steal more than 100 jin of early rice from the cooperative. According to others, this cooperative member, who has always been wealthy, still has 115 jin of old grain, 50 jin of buckwheat, and more than one dou of rice at home.

After the masses reasoned with them through struggle and conducted ideological criticism, these two "grain-deficient households" admitted that they were not short of grain. They had their own purposes for desperately shouting that there was "not enough to eat." Li Zhaokui has harbored hatred towards township and commune cadres since the land reform. He tried to exploit every opportunity to attack cadres and undermine agricultural cooperatives. Shouting about "grain shortage" and creating an atmosphere of grain tension was a good topic for him to attack cadres and undermine agricultural cooperatives. At the time, some kind-hearted old peasants did sympathize with him, thinking that this landlord really had no food to eat. As for Fang Haiqing, although his starting point was different from Li Zhaokui's, the effect was the same. Fang Haiqing said that he created a "grain shortage" in order to get more grain and use the surplus grain to feed pigs. He had already planned it out: using one dan of grain to feed pigs would result in pork worth two dan of grain. For this purpose, he made a big fuss with the cadres. He said that he only wanted to fill his own pockets and didn't think about the interests of the agricultural cooperative and the country at all.

### “缺粮户”的秘密

　　谁说农村留粮不够吃？
    编者按　有一些人时常吵吵：“留给农民的粮食不够吃！”或者说：“供应缺粮户的粮食不够吃！”究竟够吃不够吃？在许多农村里进行的大辩论中，正在讨论或者已经讨论了这个问题。事实证明：绝大多数叫“不够吃”的人，实际上所留的或者供应的粮食是够吃甚至有余的。这里发表的就是一些实例。
　　“缺粮户”的秘密
    今年春天，湖南省长沙县合心乡的乡、社干部们，为一部分群众叫喊缺粮的事大伤脑筋。明明去年统购统销时，把口粮都留足了，但有些人还是叫喊缺粮，其中少数人闹得很起劲，简直使他们不能安心生产和工作。“他们为什么叫喊缺粮？他们真的缺粮吗？”最近这个乡开展社会主义宣传教育运动以后，群众揭发了大量的事实，证明过去闹缺粮最凶的人，都是家中有余粮的人。
    这里只谈两个例子：
    龙潭社地主李兆奎，是今春吸收入社并由农业社管制生产的。他去年单干，口粮留的比社员还稍多一些。但从今年春天开始，他就找干部，要求国家补销粮食。干部不答应，李兆奎也不罢休。一直到收早稻时，他共找过干部三十四次，每次都是吵粮食。他借口“缺粮”，不出工，还拉拢几名社员在农忙的时候出去做生意。新谷一收下来，他就向别家借新米吃，表示真正缺粮。在这次合心乡反击地主、富农、残余反革命分子破坏活动中，李兆奎的邻居揭发：这个一贯叫喊“缺粮”的李兆奎，家里还藏有一百二十斤陈谷，十多斤糯米和二十五斤已经发霉的荞麦。
    群力社的社员方海清，今年喊“缺粮”也很厉害。他见到干部开口就骂，声称“不搞粮食来就不行”。收早稻的时候，他竟借口“缺粮”，私自抢割社里早稻一百多斤。经别人揭发，这位生活一向富裕的社员现在家中也还有一百一十五斤陈谷，五十斤荞麦和一斗多大米。
    经过群众的说理斗争和进行思想批判之后，这两个“缺粮户”都承认他们并不缺粮。他们所以竭力叫喊粮食“不够吃”，是各有目的的。李兆奎自从土地改革以后，对乡社干部就怀有仇恨。他处处钻空子，企图打击干部，破坏农业社。大喊“缺粮”，造成粮食紧张的空气，正是他打击干部、破坏农业社的好题目。在当时，确实有一些好心的老农民，以为这个地主真的没饭吃而同情他。至于方海清，他的出发点虽然和李兆奎不同，但效果则是一样的。方海清说，他闹“缺粮”是为了多搞一些粮食到手，把多余的粮食拿来喂猪。他早打好了算盘：用一担谷喂猪，长出猪肉来，就值两担谷的钱。为了这个目的，就向干部大吵大闹。他说，他只想把自己的荷包装满一些，根本没想到农业社和国家的利益。
