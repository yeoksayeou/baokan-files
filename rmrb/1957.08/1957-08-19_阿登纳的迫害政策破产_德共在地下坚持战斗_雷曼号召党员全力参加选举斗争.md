Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: According to TASS, Berlin: "Neues Deutschland" published on the 17th a letter from the Central Committee of the German Communist Party to the working class and all German people on the first anniversary of the banning of the German Communist Party, broadcast by the German 904 Free Radio Station. The letter to the people stated that the instigators of the ban on the German Communist Party wanted to exclude the German Communist Party from political life; they wanted to remove all obstacles to continuing the rearmament policy and implementing the conscription policy in the Federal Republic, and continue preparations for an atomic war. However, they have not been able to do this. Everyone knows that despite being banned and persecuted, the German Communist Party still exists and continues to fight. A year ago today, the West German government used terror and violence to ban the activities of the German Communist Party, and at the same time forced the dissolution of the Communist Party organization through the police, confiscating the German Communist Party's newspapers and office buildings. However, in the past year, the German Communist Party, despite terror and persecution, has continued to fight for the vital interests of the German people and against the West German government's policy of preparing for a new war.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 18th: Lehmann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, said in a radio address on the anniversary of the banning of the German Communist Party on the 17th: German militarists and their governments have banned the German Communist Party four times. On three occasions, those who banned the Communist Party were ultimately destroyed. There is no doubt that with the development of the people's struggle, the German Communist Party will regain its full legal status.

Lehmann, on behalf of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, expressed his gratitude to all members who are loyal to the cause of the Party and the cause of the working class, as well as to those who support the German Communist Party's struggle for legal status.

Lehmann emphasized that the West German ruling clique's attempt to paralyze the activities of the German Communist Party has failed. Lehmann said, our enemies clearly know the strength of our party. Now they should admit that the ban has not achieved the results they expected. Although the Party is underground, the Party's correct policy is having an increasing impact on the working class and working people.

Lehmann called on German Communist Party members to go all out in the upcoming West German election struggle to inflict a decisive defeat on Adenauer's party.

    阿登纳的迫害政策破产
    德共在地下坚持战斗
    雷曼号召党员全力参加选举斗争
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：“新德意志报”17日刊载了德意志904自由广播电台播发的德国共产党中央委员会为德国共产党被禁止一周年告工人阶级和全体德国人民书。告人民书说，取缔德共的策动者要想排斥德国共产党于政治生活之外；他们要想在联邦共和国内扫除继续执行重新武装政策和实行义务兵役制政策的一切障碍，继续准备原子战争。但是，他们没有能够做到这点。人人都知道，德国共产党尽管遭到取缔和迫害还是存在着，而且在继续战斗。一年以前的今天，西德政府用恐怖和暴力手段禁止德国共产党的活动，同时通过警察机关强迫解散了共产党组织，没收了德国共产党的机关报和办公大楼。但是，在过去的一年中，德国共产党不顾恐怖手段和迫害，仍然继续为德国人民的切身利益、为反对西德政府所奉行的准备新战争的政策进行了斗争。
    据新华社柏林18日电　德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼17日在德国共产党被禁止一周年纪念日发表的广播演说中说：德国军国主义者和他们的政府前后四次禁止过德国共产党。已经有三次，那些禁止共产党的人终于遭到了毁灭。毫无疑问，随着人民斗争的发展，德国共产党将重新得到它的完全的合法地位。
    雷曼代表德国共产党中央委员会对忠于党的事业、工人阶级事业的全体党员以及支持德共争取合法地位的斗争的人表示感谢。
    雷曼强调指出，西德统治集团使德共活动陷入瘫痪状态的企图是落空了。雷曼说，我们的敌人清楚地知道我们党的力量。现在他们应该承认，禁止并没有收到他们所期望的结果。虽然党正处在地下，但是党的正确政策对工人阶级和劳动人民的影响越来越大。
    雷曼号召德国共产党党员在即将到来的西德选举斗争中全力以赴，使阿登纳的党遭到决定性失败。
