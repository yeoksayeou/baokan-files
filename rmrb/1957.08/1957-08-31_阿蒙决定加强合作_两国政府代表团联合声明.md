　　Albania and Mongolia Decide to Strengthen Cooperation
　  Joint Statement by Government Delegations of the Two Countries
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, August 30th: The Tirana newspapers published on August 29th a joint statement from the talks between the Albanian and Mongolian government delegations, saying that the two governments reiterated their complete support for the measures and constructive proposals taken and put forward by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries to ease international tensions, reduce armaments and armed forces, ban the testing and use of thermonuclear weapons, and defend peace and the security of all peoples.
    The two countries support the aspirations and efforts of the peoples of Asia and Africa to strive for freedom and national independence, and welcome the increasingly positive role played by the independent countries of Asia and Africa in the world.
    The statement, signed by Shehu and Tsedenbal, said that during the talks, both sides held completely identical views on all the issues discussed. The two government delegations held completely identical assessments of the current international situation.
    The two delegations believe that the solidarity and unity of the socialist camp countries, headed by the Soviet Union, is a reliable guarantee for their survival and smooth development. In the current international situation, when the reactionary groups of imperialist countries continue to carry out aggressive activities, sharpening international tensions, it is of greater significance to strengthen the solidarity and unity of the socialist camp.
    The statement pointed out that the Mongolian side fully supports Albania's peaceful and friendly foreign policy, especially its peaceful and friendly policy towards the Balkan and Near Eastern countries. The Albanian government reiterated the statement in the Albanian-Mongolian statement of September 6, 1956, regarding the admission of Mongolia to the United Nations. In the communique, both sides noted with pleasure that the friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the two countries has been further developed in recent years, and will be expanded and strengthened in the future.

　　阿蒙决定加强合作
　  两国政府代表团联合声明
    新华社地拉那30日电　地拉那报纸8月29日发表的阿尔巴尼亚和蒙古两国政府代表团会谈联合声明说，两国政府再次声明完全支持苏联和其他爱好和平国家为缓和国际紧张局势、裁减军备和武装部队、禁止试验和使用热核武器、保卫和平和各国人民安全而采取的措施和提出的建设性建议。
    两国支持亚非国家人民为争取自由和民族独立的意愿和努力，欢迎亚非各独立国家在世界上所起的愈来愈大的积极作用。
    这个由谢胡和泽登巴尔签字的声明说，会谈期间，双方对所讨论的一切问题的观点完全一致。两国政府代表团对目前国际局势的估计完全一致。
    两国代表团认为，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的团结一致是它们的生存和顺利发展的可靠保证。在目前的国际局势中，当帝国主义国家反动集团继续进行侵略活动而使国际紧张局势尖锐化的时候，加强社会主义阵营的团结一致具有更大的意义。
    声明指出，蒙古方面完全支持阿尔巴尼亚的和平友好的外交政策，特别是它对巴尔干和近东国家的和平友好政策。阿尔巴尼亚政府重申了1956年9月6日阿蒙声明中关于接纳蒙古加入联合国的声明。在公报中双方都高兴地指出两国之间的友谊和全面的合作近几年来已经获得进一步发展，今后并将获得扩大和加强。
