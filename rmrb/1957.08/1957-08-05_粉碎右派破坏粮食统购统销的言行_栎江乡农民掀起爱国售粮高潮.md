Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, August 4th. More than 9,000 peasants in Lijiang Township, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, have used practical actions of enthusiastically selling new grain to crush the rampant attacks of bourgeois right-wing elements on the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain.

    Since the fallacies of bourgeois right-wingers such as Ge Peiqi opposing the unified purchase and sale of grain spread to Lijiang Township, local unlawful landlords, rich peasants, and controlled elements took the opportunity to respond. Wei Huanzhang, a member of Xiangshan Agricultural Cooperative who had served as a secretary in the puppet county government, said: "Huang Shaohong and Wu Weiping (member of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, right-wing element) are not satisfied with the grain work. If the Communist Party does not change the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, the Communist Party will not last long." He also incited farmers not to actively resist drought. Unlawful rich peasant Lu Yazhen and counter-revolutionary element Wang Fangchun, who had served as a battalion commander in the Kuomintang artillery, not only spread reactionary remarks everywhere, but also incited some members to refuse to sell grain to the state.

    The Lijiang Township General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to make the broad masses of peasants recognize the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy of unlawful landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, launched a reasoning struggle in all agricultural cooperatives in the township. Through this struggle, they conducted socialist education for the peasants throughout the township.

    As of August 1st, ten agricultural cooperatives in the township had held members' meetings to launch face-to-face reasoning struggles against these reactionary elements. While struggling, the peasants throughout the township also launched an upsurge of patriotic grain sales. Many agricultural cooperatives were fighting drought during the day and delivering grain at night, or women were treading water wheels while men delivered grain to the granary. After drying and cleaning the public grain and surplus grain that the Sicheng Agricultural Cooperative was preparing to sell to the state, more than 200 members delivered more than 115,000 jin of new grain to the granary in one go before dawn the next day. In three days, this cooperative not only completed the 215,000 jin summer grain procurement task without owing a single grain, but also over-sold more than 5,000 jin of surplus grain. According to statistics, by the end of July, ten agricultural cooperatives in the township had sold a total of more than 1.6 million jin of grain.

    粉碎右派破坏粮食统购统销的言行
    栎江乡农民掀起爱国售粮高潮
    新华社杭州4日电　浙江省诸暨县栎江乡九千多农民，以踊跃交售新粮的实际行动，粉碎了资产阶级右派分子对粮食统购统销政策的猖狂进攻。
    自从葛佩琦等资产阶级右派分子反对粮食统购统销的谬论传到栎江乡以后，当地的不法地主、富农和被管制的分子乘机起来响应。象山农业社一个曾做过伪县政府秘书的社员魏焕章说：“黄绍竑、吴惟平（民革浙江省委员，右派分子）这些大人物对粮食工作都不满意，如果共产党再不改变粮食统购统销政策，共产党一定长不了。”他并且煽动农民不要积极抗旱。桥亭社不法富农卢雅珍和曾当过国民党炮兵营长的反革命分子王芳春，不仅到处散播反动言论，而且还煽动一些社员拒绝把粮食卖给国家。
    中共栎江乡总支，为了使广大农民认清不法地主、富农和坏分子的反党反社会主义的阴谋，在全乡各个农业社开展了说理斗争。并通过这一斗争，向全乡农民进行了社会主义教育。
    到8月1日为止，全乡有十个农业社召开了社员大会，对这批反动分子展开了面对面的说理斗争。全乡农民在斗争同时，还掀起爱国售粮的高潮。很多农业社白天抗旱、夜晚送粮，或者是女的车水，男的送粮入仓。泗村农业社把准备交售给国家的公粮余粮晒干扬净以后，第二天天还没有亮，两百多个社员一次就把十一万五千多斤新谷送进了粮仓。在三天中，这个社不仅颗粒不欠的完成了二十一万五千斤夏粮征购任务，还超额售出五千多斤余粮。据统计，到7月底止，全乡十个农业社总共已交售了一百六十多万斤粮食。
