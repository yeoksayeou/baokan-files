    Dead Soul
    From there floats this corpse, its stench permeating and enveloping itself, this corpse that floats from there, riding the evil waves, and stirring up the dregs from the bottom of the water. The swirling dregs embrace the corpse, noisy and clamorous, and in the midst of the noise and clamor, the corpse suddenly stands up. How terrifying! It's not dead! No, it is a dead soul, usually appearing in the dark of night—
    In the bright daytime,
    It changes in a hundred ways to conceal its tracks. Every spring when hundreds of flowers bloom, and the scenery is enchanting, it transforms itself and extends a cluster of pale white flower branches. In summer, when cool breezes gently blow across the lotus pond, dotted with red amidst the green, it burrows deep into the mud beneath the green waves, emitting wisps of foul odor. In autumn, when osmanthus blossoms are golden yellow, and their sweet fragrance evokes reverie, this dead soul actually shrinks the ten li of osmanthus fragrance to nine. Winter—the season of collection, this dead soul, having gorged itself on fruits, begins its hibernation—silent as death. In these inspiring days of prosperity and abundance, the dead soul is thus degenerate, drifting and wandering, secretly weeping in the stillness of the night. Recalling the years of rapid storms and surging tempests, when heroes dominated the scene, their clothes soaked with sweat and blood, this dead soul only grinned hideously, feigning ecstasy. Only when the foul winds and turbid waves suddenly roll back, and all the evil ghosts appear and dance wildly, does this dead soul reveal its true form and launch a desperate and insane attack on the Party and the people! However, the foundation of the Party and the people is incomparably strong, and any ridiculous shaking is a waste of effort. And the mighty vanguard is a clear and turbulent stream, and all that is dirty will be purified or discarded in the rapid current, whether it is a dead soul or a corpse. In the powerful sunshine of the Party, it can only be destroyed or transformed into fertile mud!

    死魂灵
    俯拾那里飘来这具死尸，臭气弥漫的笼罩着它自己，那里飘来的死尸乘着恶浪，和水底的沉渣一齐卷起。回旋的沉渣拥着死尸吵闹喧嚣，死尸在吵闹喧嚣里忽然站立。可怕呀！它没有死！不，它是一只死魂灵，平时就出现于黑夜——
    在明朗的白天
    它百般变化来掩藏形迹。每当春天百花盛开，风光旖旎，它摇身一变伸出一簇惨白的花枝。在夏天，凉风习习，吹过万绿丛中点点红的荷花池，它深钻入碧波之下的污泥中散出缕缕的腐臭气。秋天，桂花金黄，甜香引起遐思，这死魂灵竟使桂花的十里飘香、缩成九里。冬天——收藏的季节，这死魂灵吞饱了果实开始了它的冬眠——默默如死。在这使人奋发的盛世丰年时日，死魂灵就是这样堕落、飘荡游离，在夜静更深的时候偷偷哭泣。回想到急风骤雨狂飙突进的年代，英雄们叱咤风云、汗血满衣，这死魂灵也只裂嘴狞笑、装作狂喜。只有在腥风浊浪突然倒卷，一切恶鬼都出现狂舞之时，这死魂灵才大显真身向党与人民使出绝望的疯狂攻击！然而，党与人民的根基坚强无比，任何可笑的摇撼都白费气力。而浩荡的先锋队是一江清澈的激流，一切肮脏都将在急流中净化或被抛弃，不管是死魂灵、是死尸，在强大的党的阳光中，只有被消毁或化作肥泥！
