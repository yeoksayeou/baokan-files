Right-wing bourgeois elements, in addition to putting forward a reactionary scientific program, have also released many fallacies in the social sciences, such as saying that the works of Marxism-Leninism are "dogmatism," that criticizing bourgeois theories is "sectarianism," and demanding that Marxist-Leninist economists learn from bourgeois economists. The same ideas have also been exposed in the field of statistical science. At the symposium convened by the State Statistical Bureau and on other occasions, rightists, under rather clever disguises, also made vicious slanders against our country's statistical work. Their methods of attack are exactly the same as in other fields, namely, obliterating achievements, exaggerating shortcomings, slandering socialism, and praising capitalism. For example, they said that the leading organs of our country's statistical work have no statisticians, that our country has no scientific statistical work at all, that our country does not yet have qualified statistical data, and that the statistical organs are simply unwilling to provide statistical data to the people. In a word, it is truly "pitch black." The reason for this is that they do not trust the old statisticians, that they learn from the Soviet Union but do not learn from British and American bourgeois statisticians. The conclusion is naturally only one: to invite bourgeois old statisticians to lead our country's statistical work.

All statistical workers across the country should quickly rise up to counterattack these rightists and refute all their absurd statements.

First, we must ask these rightists, in the less than eight years since the founding of New China, has our statistical work made leaping progress, or is it devoid of achievements and pitch black? Comparing the achievements of New China in statistical work over the past few years with the achievements of Old China over several decades, which is greater and which is smaller? Many of the old statisticians in our country (including rightists) held leading positions in the statistical work of Old China. Under their leadership, what great achievements did the statistical work of Old China achieve? Anyone who studies the Chinese economy will feel distressed by the lack of complete and scientifically based statistical data in Old China. The statistical work of New China was almost established from scratch. Over the past few years, from nothing, a set of scientific statistical accounting system and statistical reporting system has been established, and many large-scale survey and statistical works have been carried out, thus collecting a large amount of statistical data that can reflect the development of the national economy and can be used as the basis for national economic planning and management. But the rightist gentlemen insist that New China has no scientific statistics and simply does not understand statistics. They cite some of their own "scattered" statistics conducted before liberation, as if only these are the model of "scientific" statistical work. Does this fallacy of inverting black and white even need to be refuted? The rightists say that the statistical workers of New China are "sitting in a well and looking at the sky." This sentence is a true portrayal of the rightists themselves. They sit in the well of capitalism and look at the sky of socialism. No wonder they see the great achievements of socialist construction as so small.

Secondly, we must ask the rightists, according to what do you say that the statistical workers of New China do not understand statistics and that the statistics of New China are not scientific? The rightists believe that Marxism-Leninism is not science, so the statistics based on Marxist political economy (here, statistics of course refers to social and economic statistics) are not scientific, and only statistics based on mathematical statistics are science. Tell the rightists, you are wrong, and we will never agree with your opinion. We admit that mathematical statistics, as a method, is useful for social and economic statistics; but our social and economic statistics must never be based on mathematical statistics. The reason is simple: the task of social and economic statistics is to analyze social phenomena and study the specific processes of social and economic development in various countries and periods, which requires the use of the most effective tool for analyzing social phenomena—Marxist political economy. Of course, statisticians study the process of social and economic development and use numbers to express it, so mathematics and mathematical statistics are also useful to us; but simply using mathematical statistics cannot solve social and economic problems. To analyze social and economic phenomena, we mainly rely on Marxist political economy and should be based on Marxist political economy. Bourgeois statisticians attempt to use mathematical statistics to predict capitalist economic crises, which seems like a big joke to us, but in the eyes of the rightists, only this is a "scientific method." Such a "scientific" attitude clearly lacks the most basic scientific common sense.

According to the theory of Marxist political economy, to stipulate a complete set of statistical indicator system and grouping methods, so as to scientifically analyze various social and economic phenomena, this is, in our opinion, an extremely important task for statistical workers. Old statisticians are different from us. They stipulate the statistical indicator system and grouping methods according to the bourgeois vulgar economic theory. They oppose class analysis of various social phenomena. In their view, landlords and peasants, capitalists and workers only have quantitative differences, not qualitative differences. Therefore, the results of their surveys and statistics prove that China only has "big poverty and small poverty," no landlords, and no bourgeoisie. They say that class struggle does not exist objectively and was deliberately created by the Communist Party. This is the real difference between the old statisticians and us. As for using statistical data to study various problems in socialist construction and helping the country to plan and manage the national economy, this is of course not a problem that the old statisticians are concerned about, because they simply do not approve of socialism. Then it is not difficult to imagine what the result would be if the old statisticians did not study Marxism-Leninism and did not carry out ideological transformation, and if we relied on such old statisticians to lead the statistical work of New China.

The rightists say that we have learned the wrong things from the Soviet Union. They say that Marx and Lenin were not statisticians; that the highest level of statistical theory research is in Britain, and the highest level of application is in the United States, so we should learn from Britain and the United States. We admit that Britain and the United States have made some achievements in the research of mathematical statistics, but as mentioned earlier, relying on mathematical statistics cannot solve all the practical problems in socialist construction. If our country's statistical work is to serve socialist construction and to serve the planned management of the national economy, then we should learn from the Soviet Union, which has forty years of experience in building socialism. Isn't this obvious? As for saying that learning from the Soviet Union should be combined with the specific conditions of our country and should not be copied mechanically, this is correct, and we have always followed this policy; but this does not mean that we should not learn from the Soviet Union and instead learn from Britain and the United States. The achievements of British and American academic research, as long as they are useful to us, should be absorbed critically; but we must still focus on learning from the Soviet Union. This policy cannot be shaken in the slightest. The rightists say that we have taken a detour in learning from the Soviet Union and should follow them. It is certain that if we follow the rightists, it will not be a detour, but a return to the capitalist road, back to the old road of Old China. Can the Chinese people tolerate this?

Furthermore, the rightists say that New China does not have qualified statistical data, or that the Communist Party monopolizes new statistical data, thus hindering scientific research. They even frantically say that the Communist Party embraces the "the people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it" policy of fooling the people, so that such socialism is not as good as capitalism and is simply feudalism. Can we tolerate such nonsense? The statistical work of New China must be built from scratch. Such a large country, such complex economic conditions, and such rapid changes, to grasp the overall situation and reflect the development process, is obviously not an easy task. But even so, in just a few years, we have basically mastered the most important statistical data reflecting the changes in the national economy and supplied it to the people of the whole country, especially to the state leading organs and to the old and new statisticians. The New China led by the Communist Party systematically and comprehensively reports the development of the national economy to the people of the whole country every year. Whenever an important issue occurs, the responsible comrades of the government make special reports to the people. In every report, many important statistical figures are listed. Is this what the rightist gentlemen call a "policy of fooling the people"? May I ask the rightist gentlemen, which dynasty in China, which capitalist country in the world, has ever made so many, truthful, and detailed reports to the people? Has the Chiang Kai-shek government ever done such a thing? Have the British Conservative Party, the Labour Party, or the American Republican Party and the Democratic Party ever done such a thing? Is socialism not as good as capitalism, or is capitalism not as good as socialism?

We are not complacent about the supply of statistical data, and we are working hard to improve it. In the past, we did not supply much statistical data. But it has gradually increased over the past year and will continue to increase in the future. The main reason why our statistical data supply is not enough is not secrecy (of course, preserving state secrets is absolutely necessary, and no one can object to it), but because many statistical data are not complete enough or the accuracy is not high enough, and we must carry out careful inspection, research and supplementation. We will only officially announce it when it is quite reliable. This is our serious and responsible attitude towards the people and statistical work. We examine the shortcomings in our own work and strive to improve them. This has nothing in common with the rightists' slander and calumny.

Finally, we must also question the rightists. In the past few years, your "complete skills" have not been fully utilized. Is it, as you say, entirely the result of the Communist Party's sectarianism? If, as the rightists say, the statistical workers of New China are all unlearned, and these rightist gentlemen are the most knowledgeable and experienced statisticians, then what is it if not sectarianism? Unfortunately, this is not the case. New China wants to build socialism, while the rightists' minds are full of capitalist ideas. It is only natural that capitalist "heroes" cannot find a "place to use their skills" in socialist countries. If the old statisticians do not work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and cleanse the capitalist ideas in their minds, they will never be able to contribute to the statistical work of New China. The rightists complain that we let a certain old gentleman's "student's student" review their manuscripts, saying that this is the most obvious manifestation of disrespect for the old前辈 (senior, veteran). Tell the rightists, we respect the前辈 (senior, veteran), but we respect the truth even more, and we respect the interests of the country and the people. If a certain old gentleman's mind is full of capitalist ideas, then what reason do we have not to let his "student's student" review his manuscript? Wasn't it Kong Fuzi's students of dozens of generations who "overthrew the Confucian shop" during the May Fourth Movement?

The Communist Party is conscientiously examining and correcting the sectarian work style that exists in some comrades and some work departments. In the past, our statistical work departments did not pay enough attention to the unity and education of the old statisticians, and their strength was not fully utilized. We are considering taking appropriate measures to correct this shortcoming. But if the rightists attempt to oppose the Communist Party and socialism under the guise of Marxism-Leninism, then there will only be struggle and no unity. Here, we have a deeper understanding that "dismantling walls and filling ditches" must be done on both sides. If the old intellectuals refuse to carry out ideological transformation, thinking that asking them to cleanse capitalist ideas will "hurt their self-esteem," or even saying that it is "humiliating" them, or even saying that it is "forcing confessions," then what we support is socialism, and what they support is capitalism. There is simply no common ideology, no common language, and what common foundation can we unite on? The rightists may be thinking like this: as long as you give up Marxism-Leninism and give up socialism, can't we unite closely? Yes, this is the method of "dismantling walls and filling ditches" that the rightists hope for; however, we will never approve of such unity, and the people of the whole country will never approve of it. If the rightists insist on their mistakes, then they will isolate themselves from the people.

We must resolutely carry out the anti-rightist struggle and completely eliminate rightist ideas from our statistical work team. But we must not relax our rectification movement to oppose bureaucracy, oppose subjectivism, and oppose sectarianism because of this. We must seek truth from facts, affirm our achievements on the one hand, and say with confidence that our achievements are the main and fundamental ones; on the other hand, we must also conscientiously examine various shortcomings in our work and correct them quickly. We must better unite all statisticians and statistical workers who truly support socialism, mobilize forces from all sides to improve our statistical work, so as to better contribute to our country's socialist construction. Our slogan is to fight the rightists and rectify the work style at the same time, everything for the people, everything for the victory of socialism!

    驳斥统计学家中的右派言论
　　薛暮桥
    资产阶级右派分子除提出了反动的科学纲领以外，他们在社会科学方面，也放出了许多谬论，如说马克思列宁主义的著作都是“教条主义”，批判资产阶级学说就是“宗派主义”，要求马克思列宁主义经济学者去向资产阶级经济学者学习。同样的思想，也在统计科学的领域里暴露出来。右派分子在国家统计局召集的座谈会中和在其它各种场合，也在相当巧妙的伪装下，对我国的统计工作进行了恶毒的诬蔑。他们的进攻方法，同在其它领域完全一样，就是抹煞成绩，夸大缺点，诬蔑社会主义，夸耀资本主义。如说我国统计工作的领导机关没有统计学家，我国根本没有科学的统计工作，我国还没有合规格的统计资料，而且统计机关根本不愿意向人民提供统计资料，一句话说：真是“漆黑一团”。原因何在，就是不信任旧统计学家，就是学习苏联而不向英美资产阶级统计学家学习。结论就自然只有一条，请资产阶级旧统计学家来领导我国的统计工作。
    全国统计工作者应当迅速起来反击这些右派分子，驳斥他们的一切荒谬言论。
    首先我们要问问这些右派分子，新中国成立不到八年，我们的统计工作究竟是获得了飞跃的进展，还是毫无成绩，漆黑一团呢？把新中国几年来在统计工作方面的成就，同旧中国几十年的成就比一比，究竟是谁大谁小呢？我国的旧统计学家（包括右派分子在内），很多是在旧中国的统计工作中站在领导地位的。在他们的领导下，旧中国的统计工作究竟获得了多大的成绩呢？凡是研究中国经济的人，都会因旧中国缺乏完整的、有科学根据的统计资料而感到苦闷。新中国的统计工作，几乎是从处女地上建立起来的。几年来从无到有，建立了一套科学的统计核算制度和统计表报制度，进行了许多次规模巨大的调查统计工作，因而收集了能够反映国民经济的发展情况，能够作为国民经济计划管理的依据的大量的统计资料。但右派先生们却硬说，新中国没有科学的统计，而且根本不懂统计。他们举出一些自己在解放前所进行的“东鳞西爪”的统计，好像只有这才是“科学”的统计工作的典范。这种颠倒黑白的谬论，难道还用得到花力气来驳斥吗？右派分子说新中国的统计工作者是“坐井观天”，这句话正好是为右派分子自己的写照。他们坐资本主义的井，观社会主义之天，难怪他们把社会主义建设的巨大成就看得如此渺小了。
    其次，我们要问右派分子，根据什么你们说新中国的统计工作者不懂统计学，说新中国的统计不科学呢？右派分子认为，马克思列宁主义不是科学，因此建立在马克思主义的政治经济学的基础上的统计学（这里所说的统计学当然是指社会经济统计）是不科学的，只有建立在数理统计基础上的统计学才是科学。告诉右派分子，你们自己错了，我们是决不会同意你们的意见的。我们承认：数理统计作为方法来讲，对于社会经济统计是有用处的；但是我们的社会经济统计决不能建立在数理统计的基础上。理由很简单，社会经济统计的任务是要分析社会现象，研究各个国家、各个时期社会经济发展的具体过程，这就必须利用分析社会现象的最有效的工具——马克思主义的政治经济学。当然，统计学家研究社会经济的发展过程，是用数字来表现的，因此数学和数理统计对于我们也有用处；但单纯利用数理统计不能解决社会经济问题。要分析社会经济现象，就主要依靠马克思主义的政治经济学，应以马克思主义的政治经济学为基础。资产阶级统计学家企图利用数理统计来预测资本主义经济危机，这在我们看来是个大笑话，但在右派分子看来，只有这样才是“科学方法”。这样的“科学”态度，显然缺乏最起码的科学常识。
    根据马克思主义的政治经济学的理论，来规定一套完整的统计指标体系和分组方法，以便用来科学地分析各种社会经济现象，这在我们看来是统计工作者的一件极重要的任务。旧统计学家和我们不同，他们根据资产阶级的庸俗的经济理论来规定统计指标体系和分组方法。他们反对对各种社会现象进行阶级分析。在他们看来，地主和农民、资本家和工人只有量的差别，没有质的差别。因此他们调查统计的结果，证明中国只有“大贫小贫”，没有地主，也没有资产阶级。他们说阶级斗争在客观上不存在，是共产党故意制造出来的。这就是旧统计学家同我们之间的真正的区别。至于说，利用统计资料来研究社会主义建设中的各种问题，帮助国家来对国民经济进行计划管理，这当然更不是旧统计学家所关心的问题，因为他们是根本不赞成社会主义的。那就不难想像，如果旧统计学家不学习马克思列宁主义，不进行思想改造，如果我们依靠这样的旧统计学家来领导新中国的统计工作，那会得到怎么样的结果呢？
    右派分子说我们学苏联学错了，他们说马克思、列宁都不是统计学家；研究统计理论最高明的是英国，而在应用方面最高明的是美国，因此应当向英国美国学习。我们承认，英国美国在数理统计的研究方面是有若干成就的，但如前所述，依靠数理统计不能解决社会主义建设中的一切实际问题。如果我国的统计工作要为社会主义建设服务，要为国民经济的计划管理服务，就应当向建设社会主义已有四十年经验的苏联学习，这不是十分明显的事情吗？至于说，学习苏联应该结合我国具体情况，不能照抄照搬，这是对的，我们也是一直按此方针办的；但这决不是说不学苏联，改向英美学习。英美的学术研究上的成就，只要对我们有用，应该有批判地加以吸收；但肯定仍应以学习苏联为主，这样的方针是丝毫也不能动摇的。右派分子说我们学习苏联走了弯路，应该跟他们走。可以肯定，如果跟着右派分子走，那就不是走弯路，而是走回头路，回到资本主义道路上去，回到旧中国的老路上去。这难道是中国人民能够容忍的吗？
    更次，右派分子说新中国没有合规格的统计资料，或者说共产党垄新统计资料，因而妨碍科学研究。他们甚至疯狂地说：共产党抱着“民可使由之，不可使知之”的愚民政策，因而这样的社会主义还不如资本主义，简直就是封建主义。这样的胡言乱语难道是我们所能容忍的吗？新中国的统计工作要从头建设起来，这样大的国家，这样复杂的经济情况，而且又是如此迅速地变化，要掌握全面情况，反映发展过程，显然不是一件轻而易举的事情。但即使如此，我们已经在短短几年中，把反映国民经济变化的最重要的统计资料基本上掌握起来了，供应了全国人民，特别是供应了国家领导机关，也供应了新旧统计学家。共产党领导的新中国年年向全国人民系统地、全面地报告国民经济的发展情况，每发生一个重要问题，都由政府负责同志向人民作专门的报告，在每一个报告中，都列举了许多重要的统计数字。难道这就是右派先生所说的“愚民政策”吗？试问右派先生，中国有哪一个朝代，世界上有哪一个资本主义国家的政府，曾经向人民做过这样多的、真实的、详细的报告呢？蒋介石政府曾经做过这样的事情吗？英国的保守党、工党，美国的共和党、民主党曾经做过这样的事情吗？究竟是社会主义不如资本主义，还是资本主义不如社会主义呢？
    对于统计资料的供应，我们并不自满，我们正在努力改进。过去我们所供应的统计资料不多。但一年来已逐渐增加，今后还要继续增加。我们统计资料供应还不够多的主要原因，不在保密（当然，保守国家秘密是完全必要的，谁也不能反对），而是由于许多统计资料还不够完整，或者正确性还不够高，还要进行慎重的检查、研究和补充，要到相当确实可靠时才正式公布，这正是我们对人民、对统计工作认真负责的态度。我们检查我们自己工作中的缺点，努力改进，这同右派分子的造谣诬蔑毫无共同之点。
    最后还要质问右派分子，几年来你们的“全副本领”没有充分发挥出来，是不是像你们所说，完全是共产党的宗派主义所造成的结果呢？如果真如右派分子所说，新中国的统计工作者都是不学无术，而这些右派先生则是最有学问、最有经验的统计学家，那末不是宗派主义又是什么呢？可惜事实不是这样，新中国要建设社会主义，而右派分子则脑子里装满了资本主义思想，资本主义“英雄”在社会主义国家找不到“用武之地”，这是理所当然的事情。如果旧统计学家不努力学习马列主义，清洗自己头脑中的资本主义思想，那是决不能对新中国的统计工作有所贡献的。右派分子抱怨我们让某老先生的“学生的学生”审查他们的书稿，说这是不尊重老前辈的最明显的表现。告诉右派分子，我们尊重前辈，但更尊重真理，尊重国家和人民的利益。如果某老先生满脑子的资本主义思想，那我们有什么理由不让他的“学生的学生”对他的书稿进行审查呢？五四运动时代“打倒孔家店”的不就是孔夫子的几十代的学生吗？
    共产党正在认真地检查并纠正在某些同志和某些工作部门中所存在的宗派主义作风，我们统计工作部门过去对旧统计学家的团结和教育注意得还不够，对他们的力量没有充分利用，我们正在考虑采取适当的措施来改正这种缺点。但右派分子如果企图披着马克思列宁主义的伪装来反对共产党和社会主义，这样就只有斗争，谈不上团结。在这里使我们更深刻地体会到“拆墙填沟”必须从两方面来努力，如果旧知识分子不肯进行思想改造，认为要求他们清洗资本主义思想就会“伤害他们的自尊心”，就是对他们“侮辱”，甚至说是“屈打成招”，那末，我们拥护的是社会主义，他们拥护的是资本主义，就根本没有共同的思想、共同的语言，有什么共同基础可以互相团结呢？右派分子心里可能在这样想，只要你们放弃马克思列宁主义，放弃社会主义，不是就可以亲密团结了吗？是的，这就是右派分子所希望的“拆墙填沟”的方法；然而这样的团结，是我们万万不赞成的，也是全国人民万万不赞成的。右派分子如果坚持自己的错误，那就是自绝于人民。
    我们要坚决进行反右派斗争，把右派思想从我们的统计工作队伍中完全清除出去。但我们也丝毫不能因此而放松了自己的反对官僚主义、反对主观主义、反对宗派主义的整风运动。我们必须实事求是，一方面肯定自己的成绩，理直气壮地说我们的成绩是主要的、基本的；另一方面也要认真检查自己工作中的各种缺点，迅速予以纠正。我们必须更好地团结一切真正拥护社会主义的统计学家和统计工作者，动员各方面的力量来改进我们的统计工作，才能更有助于我国的社会主义建设。我们的口号是反右、整风两不误，一切为着人民，一切为着社会主义的胜利！
