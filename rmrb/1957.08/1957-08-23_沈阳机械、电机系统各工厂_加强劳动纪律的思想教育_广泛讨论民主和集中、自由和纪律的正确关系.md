Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 21st: Factories in the Shenyang Machinery and Electrical Systems are conducting socialist ideological education for their employees by exposing violations of labor discipline and organizing workers to engage in extensive debates on the relationship between democracy and centralism, and freedom and discipline, which has achieved good results.

During the period of great airing of views and debates, the reactionary statements released by bourgeois rightists caused ideological confusion among a small number of workers, and violations of labor discipline by some workers became increasingly serious. Many veteran workers raised concerns, demanding that the leadership rectify labor discipline, criticize and clarify confused thinking, and consolidate the ranks of the working class. State-owned machinery and electrical systems factories such as Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, Mining Machinery Factory, Transformer Factory, Third Machine Tool Factory, High-Voltage Switch Factory, and Fan Factory, based on the opinions of the vast majority of workers, began in mid-to-late July to expose violations of labor discipline and organize all factory workers to engage in mass debates around the relationship between democracy and centralism, and freedom and discipline, in order to conduct self-education among the employees. Prior to this, most factories conducted investigations and research on violations of labor discipline and submitted the materials to the workers' representative congress for discussion and to make resolutions on rectifying labor discipline. At the same time, veteran workers were invited to report their suffering experiences in the old society, giving all workers a vivid lesson. Then, taking workshops or teams as units, universal exposures and inspections were carried out, selecting those who frequently or seriously violated labor discipline, typical examples, or problems commonly existing among workers, clarifying the goals, and conducting debates and criticisms. This attracted all factory workers, and in the process of debate and criticism, they all received profound class education.

According to the materials exposed by the factories and preliminary summaries, the behaviors that violate labor discipline are: lax labor discipline, being late, leaving early, and absenteeism; being picky about work, choosing jobs, selecting types of work, and choosing machines; disobeying commands in production, violating operating procedures, not complying with technological discipline, playing tricks on and resisting leadership, and even physically assaulting basic-level cadres. Zheng Ruiqi, an apprentice at the Shenyang Transformer Factory, has refused to accept the work assigned to him by the leadership three times in the past six months, claiming that the work must have "prospects." He has not worked for a month and two days. Workers criticized him, saying, "You have been in the factory for less than two months, and the country has treated you for seven or eight months. You are still not working hard. Are you worthy of the country?" Young workers Li Puxiang and Ding Wei'an of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory openly demanded that the leadership promote them from third-grade workers to fourth-grade workers. When their unreasonable demands were not met, they became passive and unproductive. Apprentice Yan Xuezhen analyzed their mistakes, saying, "Don't think you are workers. If you don't work hard and still want to earn more money, this is the influence of bourgeois exploitation." Debates like this, which analyze and criticize the essence of wrong thinking by criticizing violations of labor discipline, are still deepening in various factories.

Through preliminary debate and criticism, the workers in each factory have received a profound socialist ideological education, and their class consciousness and production enthusiasm have been significantly improved. Workers in the Second Workshop of Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory have already drafted a pact to defend socialist construction. Workers in the large workshop of Shenyang Fan Factory have automatically established a gift platform to defend socialist construction. All workers in the Youth Workshop of the Complete Set Workshop of Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory have reduced the time quota for processing explosion-proof switches from seventy-six hours to fifty-three hours, increasing labor productivity by more than 30%.

　　沈阳机械、电机系统各工厂
　　加强劳动纪律的思想教育
　　广泛讨论民主和集中、自由和纪律的正确关系
    新华社沈阳21日电　沈阳市机械、电机系统各工厂通过揭发违犯劳动纪律现象，组织工人展开民主和集中、自由和纪律之间关系的大辩论对职工进行社会主义思想教育，已经收到了很好的效果。
    在大鸣大放期间，资产阶级右派分子放出来的反动言论，曾引起了少数工人的思想混乱，一部分工人违犯劳动纪律的现象日趋严重。很多老工人对此提出意见，要求领导整顿劳动纪律，批判和澄清混乱思想，巩固工人阶级队伍。沈阳风动工具厂、矿山机器厂、变压器厂、第三机床厂、高压开关厂、扇风机厂等国营机械电机系统工厂，根据绝大多数工人意见从7月中、下旬，先后开始通过揭发违犯劳动纪律现象，组织全厂工人围绕着民主和集中、自由和纪律之间关系，展开群众性的大辩论，以便在职工群众中进行自我教育。事先，多数工厂都就违犯劳动纪律现象进行了调查研究，把材料提交给职工代表大会讨论并作出整顿劳动纪律的决议，同时，邀请老工人报告他们在旧社会遭受的苦难经历，给全体工人上了生动的一课；接着，以工段或小组为单位，进行普遍揭发和检查，从中选出经常或严重违犯劳动纪律的人、典型事例或在工人中普遍存在的问题，明确目标，进行辩论和批判。这样吸引着全厂工人，在辩论和批判过程中都受到了深刻的阶级教育。
    根据各工厂揭发出来的材料和初步归纳，违犯劳动纪律的行为表现是：劳动纪律松懈，迟到、早退、旷工；工作上挑肥拣瘦，挑活、挑工种、挑机床；生产上不服从指挥，违犯操作规程，不遵守工艺纪律，耍弄、抗拒领导，甚至动手打基层干部等。沈阳变压器厂徒工郑瑞启，今年半年来以工作要有“前途”为理由，拒不接受领导三次分配给他的工作，现在已经一个月零两天没有干活。工人们批评他说：“你进厂不到两个月，国家给你治了七、八个月病，你还不好好干活，你对得起国家么？”沈阳风动工具厂青年工人李普祥、丁维安，公开提出要领导把他们从三级工提升到四级工，他们的无理要求没有得到满足时，就消极怠工。徒工阎学珍分析他们的错误说：“别看你们是工人，不好好干活还要多赚钱，这是资产阶级剥削思想作怪。”各厂像这样透过批评违犯劳动纪律现象来分析批判错误思想本质的辩论，还在逐步深入中。
    经过初步辩论和批判，各厂工人都受到了一次深刻的社会主义思想教育，阶级觉悟和生产积极性有显著提高。沈阳第一机床厂二车间工人，已经订出保卫社会主义建设公约。沈阳扇风机厂大型车间工人，自动建立起保卫社会主义建设献礼台。沈阳高压开关厂成套车间青年工段的全体工人，已经把加工防爆开关的工时定额，从七十六个小时压缩到五十三个小时，劳动生产率提高30％多。
