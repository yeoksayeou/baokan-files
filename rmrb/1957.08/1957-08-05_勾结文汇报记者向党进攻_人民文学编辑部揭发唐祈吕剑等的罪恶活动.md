Attacking the Party in Collusion with Wenhui Bao Reporters
The People's Literature Editorial Department Exposes the Criminal Activities of Tang Qi, Lü Jian, and Others

    This newspaper reports that the "People's Literature" editorial department recently held consecutive meetings of all staff to criticize and struggle against rightist elements Tang Qi and Lü Jian.

    Tang Qi and Lü Jian are both members of the China Democratic League. Tang is currently an editor of Poetry Magazine, and Lü is a member of the editorial board of Poetry Magazine. Both of them worked in the "People's Literature" editorial department for a long time in the past, and have always harbored dissatisfaction and hostility towards the Party. Not long after the rectification campaign began, at a forum of Democratic League members within the Writers Association, Tang and Lü repeatedly clamored that the Writers Association's "lid had not been lifted" and the atmosphere was "stifling." Tang Qi even called out, "Why doesn't the Wenhui Bao's Beijing-based reporter come to do work?" These words were appreciated by Yao Fangzao, a Wenhui Bao reporter who was covering the forum at the time. After the meeting, Yao immediately wrote the slanderous and provocative remarks of Tang and Lü into a news report.

    On May 30th, Mei Duo and Yao Fangzao invited Tang Qi and Lü Jian to the Wenhui Bao's Beijing office to hold a meeting to discuss how to "attack and open" the Writers Association. Gao Guangqi (formerly an editor of "People's Literature," now working in the Literature Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences), another person dissatisfied with the Party who was invited by Tang Qi, also participated in this gathering. Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Ding, due to his right-wing thinking and bourgeois journalistic views, also participated in convening this forum. At this meeting, Tang, Lü, and others provided Wenhui Bao with a large amount of so-called "internal information" about the Writers Association and literary circles, portraying the Party's leadership over literary work as completely dark. They also agreed on the spot that when Tang Qi and Lü Jian returned to "People's Literature" to participate in the rectification meeting, Mei Duo and Yao Fangzao would also attend the meeting to conduct interviews and reports.

    Soon, according to the predetermined plan, Tang, Lü, Gao, and Mei Duo successively attended the "People's Literature" rectification meeting. At these meetings, Tang Qi and others joined forces with Du Lijun of the editorial department to launch vicious attacks on the Party. Tang Qi slandered the anti-espionage movement as "violating laws and discipline" and "infringing on human rights," and as the "total outbreak of sectarianism" by the editorial department's Party organization. Du Lijun and Gao Guangqi also slandered the anti-espionage movement as "retaliation" by Party members against non-Party cadres. Tang Qi fabricated rumors, saying that in the editorial department, there was "Party monopoly" and "patriarchal rule." Gao Guangqi also said that our Party "is a one-party dictatorship, and in the editorial department, it is a dictatorship over the masses." Gao Guangqi said that in the editorial department, there is "an outer city with an inner city, and an inner city with an imperial city, and Party leading cadres sit in the imperial city issuing orders." They then attempted to coerce Party members to "revolt" and stand with them to attack the Party. Du Lijun openly clamored: "The fortress is easiest to break from within."

    Rightist elements also provoked the relationship between People's Literature and writers in many ways. Lü Jian said that "People's Literature" has had "exclusivity" since its inception, which is "sectarianism." He even fabricated facts, saying that "Party member writers are highly trusted, but non-Party writers are always viewed with suspicion." Tang Qi also spread rumors: "The editorial department gives unequal treatment to writers; works by Party member writers are published even if they are not good, and works by non-Party writers are not published even if they are good."

    Where does Tang Qi, Lü Jian, and others' hatred for the Party and the new society come from? In order to answer this question, we must first look at their past history. Lü Jian was originally a traitor to the Communist Party, and later concealed his history and infiltrated the Party, only to be purged after liberation. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Tang Qi served as a lieutenant colonel drama instructor in the Kuomintang Xi'an Labor Camp, and a lieutenant colonel captain in the Kuomintang Eighth War Zone Political Department Drama Troupe and other reactionary positions. After liberation, he fabricated his history, disguised himself as progressive, and infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. In recent years, the Party has not blamed them for their past and has provided various care and consideration in their work and life, but they still feel "the fickleness of human relationships." After the "Hungarian incident," Lü Jian bluntly said: "China needs another revolution, another new 'May Fourth'!"

### 勾结文汇报记者向党进攻  人民文学编辑部揭发唐祈吕剑等的罪恶活动

    勾结文汇报记者向党进攻
    人民文学编辑部揭发唐祈吕剑等的罪恶活动
    本报讯　“人民文学”编辑部近日连续召开全体工作人员会议，向右派分子唐祈、吕剑展开批判和斗争。
    唐祈、吕剑都是民盟盟员，唐现任诗刊编辑、吕现任诗刊编委。两人过去都长期在“人民文学”编辑部工作，一贯对党抱有不满和敌视情绪。整风开始不久，在作协召集的会内民盟盟员座谈会上，唐、吕一再叫嚣作协的“盖子未揭开”，空气“沉闷”。唐祈还呼吁：“文汇报驻京记者为何不来做工作”？这些话得到当时采访座谈会的文汇报记者姚芳藻的赏识。会后，姚立刻把唐、吕的诬蔑、挑拨性言论写成新闻加以报道。
    5月30日，梅朵、姚芳藻邀请唐祈、吕剑到文汇报驻京办事处去开会，商议如何“攻开”作协的问题。参与这次集会的，还有被唐祈邀去的另一对党不满分子高光起（原为“人民文学”编辑，现调科学院文学研究所工作）。新华社记者沈鼎由于具有右派思想和资产阶级新闻观点，也参与召集这次座谈会的活动。在这个会上，唐、吕等向文汇报提供了大量的所谓作协和文艺界的“内部情况”，把党对文学工作的领导描写成漆黑一团。并且当场议定：当唐祈、吕剑回到“人民文学”参加整风会议时，梅朵、姚芳藻也出席会议进行采访报道。
    不久，他们就按照预定计划，唐、吕、高以及梅朵接连出席了“人民文学”的整风会。在这些会上，唐祈等和编辑部的杜黎均结合起来对党作了恶毒的进攻。唐祈诬蔑肃反运动是“违法乱纪”，“侵犯人权”，是编辑部党组织“宗派主义的总爆发”。杜黎均、高光起也诬蔑肃反运动是党员对非党干部的“打击报复”。唐祈捏造说，在编辑部是“党包办”，“家长统治”。高光起也说，我们党“是一党专政，在编辑部是专群众的政”。高光起说，在编辑部是“外城里面有内城，内城里面有皇城，党员领导干部坐在皇城里面发号施令”。他们进而企图胁迫党员“起义”，和他们站在一起向党进攻。杜黎均公然叫嚣：“堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的”。
    右派分子还多方面挑拨人民文学同作家们的关系。吕剑说“人民文学”自创刊以来，就具有“排他性”，就是“宗派主义”的。甚至捏造事实，说“对党员作家十分信任，对非党作家却总是那么不放心”。唐祈也造谣说：“编辑部给作家们的待遇不平等；党员作家的作品不好也发表，非党作家的作品好也不发表。”
    唐祈、吕剑等对党、对新社会的仇恨从何而来？为着回答这问题，首先需要看一看他们过去的历史。吕剑原是共产党的叛徒，后来又隐瞒历史混入党内，解放后才被清洗出党。唐祈在抗日战争时期担任过国民党西安劳动营中校戏剧教官，国民党第八战区政治部演剧队中校队长等反动职务，解放后编造历史，伪装进步面貌混入革命队伍。几年来，党对他们不咎既往，并且在工作上、生活上给予各种关心和照顾，但他们仍然感到“世态炎凉”。“匈牙利事件”发生后，吕剑就露骨地说：“中国需要再来一次革命，再来一次新的‘五四’！”
