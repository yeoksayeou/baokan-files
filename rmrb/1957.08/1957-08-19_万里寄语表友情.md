After this newspaper published Comrade Navomov's letter introducing the "Liu Hulan" Chinese group in Sochi on July 25th, we received many letters from Chinese readers to Comrade Navomov and the "Liu Hulan" Chinese group. The following are excerpts from some of these letters.

Dear Comrade Navomov:

    I was so happy to read your letter in the "People's Daily"! You started studying China twenty years ago, and now you are guiding the younger generation in their studies. Comrade, please accept my, a Communist Youth League member's, highest respect. The great care shown to us by the great Soviet people deeply moves me. I will graduate from the Normal School next year. Friend, I will learn from you, learn Russian in a short time, and guide my students in learning and studying the great Soviet Union.

    You know, on the eve of this summer vacation, we launched a struggle against the rightists in universities across the country. At the beginning of this struggle, we invited Hero Liu Hulan's mother, Mama Hu, to give us a report. She told us about Liu Hulan's heroic deeds in her short life and encouraged us to stand on the side of the Party, defend the happy life bought with the blood of martyrs, and crush the attacks of the rightists. Mama Hu also took some photos with us when she came to give the report. I am enclosing one with this letter, please pass it on to the Chinese group named after our beloved hero Liu Hulan that you are guiding. This is not much of a gift, just a token of friendship.

              Liu Zongwu, Student, Tianjin Normal College

Dear "Liu Hulan" Chinese Group Comrades:

    I was very happy to read in the newspaper about your teacher introducing your Chinese studies. I hope to correspond with you and help each other in our studies.

    I am a student at Yulin Normal School in Yulin County, Guangxi Province, and a member of the Communist Youth League. My home is in the countryside, and my father and mother are both farmers. They joined the advanced agricultural producers' cooperative last spring. I don't pay any tuition to study at the school and I also receive a people's grant. The newspaper often publishes news of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which makes me very happy. I realize that the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is constantly increasing, while the imperialists' policies of arms expansion and war preparation are opposed by peace-loving people all over the world.

    How many characters have you learned after studying Chinese for six months? I know you have learned to sing the song "Moscow-Beijing" in Chinese. Now let me introduce you to a few Chinese songs.

    This is our first communication, and we don't know each other yet. I am sending you my photo, hoping that we will become close friends in the future. I used to serve in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and this photo was taken in the army.

          Lan Kewu, Student, Yulin Normal School, Guangxi

Respected Comrade Navomov:

    After reading your letter in the "People's Daily", my excited mood has not calmed down. Your and your students' deep friendship with the Chinese people deeply moves me. As a Chinese person, I especially thank you for your efforts in promoting the friendship between our two peoples.

    I love my country, and at the same time I love your country with the same feeling, and regard constantly enhancing Sino-Soviet friendship as our most noble international obligation.

    Dear Comrade Navomov, although we are geographically far apart, our friendly hearts are closely linked together. I am currently learning Russian and cannot write to you in Russian yet, but I believe that with your help your students will understand my letter. You can reply in Russian, and I can understand it.

    万里寄语表友情
    本报7月25日刊登了苏联拿武莫夫同志介绍索契“刘胡兰”中文小组的来信以后，收到了许多封中国读者给拿武莫夫同志和“刘胡兰”中文小组的信。下面是其中几封信的摘要。亲爱的拿武莫夫同志：
    在“人民日报”上读了你的来信，我是多么高兴啊！你远在二十年前就开始了对中国的研究，现在又指导着年青一代进行研究，同志，请接受我，一个共青团员的崇高敬意。伟大的苏联人民对我们无微不至的关怀使我深受感动。明年我就要从师范学校毕业了。朋友，我一定向你学习，在今后短时间内学会俄文，并指导我的学生学习和研究伟大的苏联。
    你知道，在这个暑假的前夕，我们全国高等学校里展开了反右派的斗争。在这个斗争开始时我们请了英雄刘胡兰的母亲胡妈妈给我们作了报告。她向我们讲了刘胡兰短短一生的英雄事迹，并鼓励我们站在党的立场，保卫烈士们用鲜血换来的幸福生活，粉碎右派分子的进攻。胡妈妈来作报告时还跟我们拍了几张照片，随信附上一张，请转给你指导的、以我们热爱的英雄刘胡兰的名字命名的中文小组。这算不了什么礼物，只是一点友谊的表示。
              天津师范学院学生柳棕梧亲爱的“刘胡兰”中文小组的同学们：
    我在报上读到了你们的老师介绍你们学习中文的情形，非常高兴。我希望和你们通信，在学习上互相帮助。
    我是广西省玉林县玉林师范学校的学生，是共青团员。我的家在农村，父亲和母亲都是农民，他们已经在去年春天加入了高级农业生产合作社。我在学校读书完全不交学费，并且享受人民助学金待遇。报上常常刊载苏联和人民民主国家社会主义建设的消息，我看了十分高兴。我认识到，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量正在不断增强，而帝国主义的扩军备战政策却遭到全世界爱好和平的人民的反对。
    你们已经学了六个月的中文，认识多少字了？我知道你们学会用中文唱“莫斯科—北京”的歌了。现在向你们介绍几首中国的歌曲吧。
    第一次通信，大家还不认识。寄上我的像片，愿以后我们成为亲密的朋友。我曾经参加过中国人民解放军，这张像片是在部队里照的。
          广西玉林师范学校学生蓝克武敬爱的拿武莫夫同志：
    我在“人民日报”上读到了你的来信后，激动的心情一直不能平静下来。你和你的学生们对中国人民的深厚友谊使我非常感动。作为一个中国人民，我特别感谢你在增进我们两国人民友谊上所作的努力。
    我热爱自己的祖国，同时也以同样的感情热爱你们的国家，把不断增进中苏友谊作为我们最崇高的国际义务。
    亲爱的拿武莫夫同志，我们之间在地理位置上虽然距离很远，但我们友谊的心却是紧紧联在一起的。我现在正在学习俄文，还不能用俄文给你们写信，但是我相信在你的帮助下你的学生会看懂我的信的。你们回信可以用俄文写，我能看懂。
