    Soviet Party and Government Leaders
    Send Congratulations on "August 1st" Army Day
    Xinhua News Agency, August 1st.　Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR K. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR N. Bulganin, and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union N. Khrushchev sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong on July 31 to congratulate him on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The telegram is as follows:
    To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
    To Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China,
    To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China,
    Dear Comrades!
    On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, please allow us to express our congratulations to you and, through you, to the fraternal Chinese people. Over the past thirty years, the People's Liberation Army has been tested by the flames of many revolutionary wars, defeated countless enemies of the Chinese people, and won freedom and independence for its country. Because the People's Liberation Army has always been cared for by the Communist Party of China, it has grown from some uprising troops into a top-notch army of which the entire Chinese people are rightfully proud. Now, the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army, equipped with the latest equipment and all modern services, is resolutely defending China's freedom and independence and the Chinese people's socialist achievements, defending peace and security in the Far East. We wish the soldiers, officers and generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the great Chinese people, new achievements in the cause of building a socialist motherland and defending peace.
                K. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR
                N. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR
                N. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
                  Moscow Kremlin, July 31, 1957

    亲爱的同志们！
    值此中国人民解放军建军三十周年纪念的时候，请允许我们向您们，并通过您们向兄弟般的中国人民表示祝贺。三十年来，人民解放军经历了多次革命战争火焰的考验，战胜了中国人民的无数敌人，并为自己的国家赢得了自由和独立。由于人民解放军经常受到中国共产党的关怀，它由一些起义的部队成长为全中国人民理所当然地引以自豪的头等的军队。现在，拥有最新装备和一切现代化兵种的强大的中国人民解放军正在坚决地捍卫着中国的自由和独立以及中国人民的各项社会主义成果，捍卫着远东的和平和安全。我们预祝中国人民解放军的士兵、军官和将领们以及伟大的全中国人民在建设社会主义祖国和保卫和平的事业中取得新的成就。
