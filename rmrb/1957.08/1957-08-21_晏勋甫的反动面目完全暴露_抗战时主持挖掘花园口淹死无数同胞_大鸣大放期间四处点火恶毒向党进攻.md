This newspaper's Wuhan, 20th dispatch (reporter Zhang Wei): Yan Xunfu, chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), has had his reactionary face fully exposed during the RCCK members' struggle against the Rightists.

Yan Xunfu has been engaging in anti-Communist and anti-people activities for thirty years, and he even served as the puppet mayor of Hankou on the eve of liberation. In 1938, when he was the Chief of Staff of the "Kuomintang First War Zone Commander's Headquarters," he presided over the digging of the Yellow River's Huayuankou, drowning countless compatriots. When he was the Director of the Puppet Bureau of Surveying, he signed the "Sino-U.S. Cooperative Aviation Survey Agreement" with U.S. imperialism, selling out the country's airspace. After liberation, he colluded with Chen Mingshu to control the Wuhan Municipal organization of the RCCK. After Chen Mingshu left Wuhan, Yan Xunfu maintained close contact with Chen Mingshu on the one hand, and formed a small clique with RCCK rightists Xiao Zuolin, Deng Jiesong, Liu Shumo, and others to continue to control the RCCK. When the Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," Yan Xunfu became even more ambitious, thinking that "the democratic parties have a great future," and put forward the development policy of "the old Kuomintang returning to the team," pulling some released reform-through-labor prisoners and controlled bad elements into the RCCK. Xiao Zuolin also repeatedly worked to assign former Kuomintang officers to work in coastal areas in order to achieve ulterior motives.

During the Great Blooming and Letting Contend, Yan Xunfu said: "I want to personally lead this movement." He personally went to the grassroots to stir up trouble, and clamored: "Counter-revolutionary targets can complain, and if they retaliate, I will fight them to the death." He personally participated in the Wuhan Municipal Government Counselor's Office RCCK branch meeting to incite: "Eight years have passed since liberation. How many eight years does a person have in their life? Take the opportunity to speak out. I am responsible if problems arise." He attacked the Party's united front policy, saying that the united front work has "three views": the upper level attaches importance, the middle level despises, and the lower level scorns, saying that the democratic parties are just for show. He also scolded the director of the Municipal Party Committee's United Front Work Department behind his back, comparing the director of the United Front Work Department to "a pig butcher who cannot do united front work." He slandered the Party's personnel work as being based solely on class origin.

　　晏勋甫的反动面目完全暴露
　  抗战时主持挖掘花园口淹死无数同胞
　  大鸣大放期间四处点火恶毒向党进攻
    本报武汉20日电　记者张碨报道：民革武汉市委主委晏勋甫的反动面目在民革成员反右派斗争中完全暴露出来了。
    晏勋甫三十年来一直干着反共反人民的勾当，在解放前夕还任伪汉口市长。他在1938年任“国民党第一战区司令长官部”参谋长时，曾主持挖掘了黄河花园口，淹死无数同胞。他任伪测量总局局长时，曾与美帝国主义签订了“中美航空测量合作协定”，出卖祖国领空。解放后，他和陈铭枢又勾勾搭搭把持民革武汉市组织。陈铭枢离开武汉后，晏勋甫一方面和陈铭枢保持密切联系，一方面和民革右派分子萧作霖、邓介松、刘叔模等结成小集团，继续把持了民革。当党提出了“长期共存、互相监督”的方针后，晏勋甫更野心勃勃，以为“今后民主党派大有搞头”，提出“旧国民党归队”的发展方针，把一些释放后的劳改犯、被管制的坏分子拉进民革来。萧作霖也一再活动将国民党旧军官分配到沿海地区工作，以达到不可告人的目的。
    大鸣大放期间，晏勋甫说：“这个运动我要亲自领导”，他亲自到基层进行点火，并叫嚣“肃反对象可以诉苦，他们如有报复，我同他们拼命去。”他亲自参加武汉市参事室民革支部大会进行煽动：“解放已八年，人生有几个八年？要趁机会放，出了问题，我负责。”他攻击党的统战政策说，统战工作有“三视”：上层重视、中层轻视、下层藐视，说民主党派是摆样子的。他背地还辱骂市委统战部长，把统战部长比作“杀猪的不能作统战工作”。他污蔑党的人事工作是唯成份论。
