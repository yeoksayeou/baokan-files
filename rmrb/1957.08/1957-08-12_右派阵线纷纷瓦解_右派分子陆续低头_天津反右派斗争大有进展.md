Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 11th: The anti-Rightist struggle in Tianjin has made great progress. In the past week, more than 230 units across the city have held nearly a thousand meetings, large and small, to conduct reasoning struggles against Rightists and investigate many major issues.

    In universities, Nankai University exposed a Rightist clique composed of economics professors Fu Zhufu, Yang Jingnian, Liu Junhuang, and associate professor Ren Zhenwei. This clique not only carried out vicious anti-Party and anti-socialist activities on campus, but also went to Renmin University of China in Beijing, together with Yang Xuedao, who used to teach at Nankai University, to plot anti-Party activities, attempting to seize leadership of the university's economics department.

    In the engineering and technical field, engineering and technical personnel of the Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries exposed the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightist clique of Huang Zhi, a liaison commissioner of the Tianjin Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party and an engineer at the Forging and Pressing Machine Tool Factory under the Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries. Huang Zhi, along with Cheng Xiubiao and Liang Zhiheng, engineers of the Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries, launched attacks on the Party, conspiring to usurp the leadership of the Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industries. In the financial and trade system, the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China initially exposed the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightist Li Sisi. Li Sisi slandered that "the Communist Party is not as good as the Kuomintang," and stirred up trouble everywhere, encouraging those who had been struggled against during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to "seek justice." The Foreign Trade Bureau exposed the Rightist Zhang Lansheng, who viciously slandered the socialist system. In the cultural system and trade union system, some Rightists were also continuously exposed. In the past week, some units also launched struggles against some Rightists within the Party. These Rightists within the Party included Shi Yutian, a clerk in the office of the Tianjin Municipal Labor Bureau, Han Kecai, an organization cadre of the Tanggu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhang Zhiying, a student at Tianjin Medical College.

    Through the reasoning struggle of the past week, the Rightist fronts in Tianjin collapsed one after another, and some Rightists, after being isolated, have completely surrendered. According to statistics from universities, so far, two-thirds of the Rightists among the faculty and staff who have been criticized have surrendered. Nearly one-third of the Rightists in the financial and trade system and the political and legal system have also made relatively honest confessions. Forty-seven Rightists in various districts of the city have also bowed their heads and confessed their crimes.

    Through the tempering of the struggle, the masses have generally improved their awareness and ability to distinguish between right and wrong. Many people not only bravely confronted the Rightists in debates, silencing them, but also actively investigated the words and deeds of the Rightists to provide materials for the struggle.

    右派阵线纷纷瓦解　右派分子陆续低头
    天津反右派斗争大有进展
    据新华社天津11日电　天津市的反右派斗争有了很大进展。最近一周来，全市二百三十多个单位共开了近千次大小会议，对右派分子展开说理斗争，追查了许多重大问题。
    在高等学校中，南开大学揭发出了经济系教授傅筑夫、杨敬年、刘君煌和副教授任振威等人组成的右派小集团，这个小集团不仅在校内进行恶毒的反党反社会主义活动，并且曾经去北京中国人民大学，同原在南开大学任教的杨学道等策划反党活动，企图夺取学校经济系的领导。
    在工程技术界，机电工业局工程技术人员揭发了农工民主党天津市筹备委员会联络委员、机电局所属锻压机床厂工程师黄植右派小集团的反动言行。黄植原同机电工业局工程师程秀标、梁之恒等结合起来向党进攻，阴谋篡夺机电局的领导。在财经贸易系统，人民银行天津分行初步揭发了右派分子李锡四的反动言行。李锡四污蔑“共产党不如国民党”，并且到处点火，鼓动肃反中被斗的人起来“伸冤”。对外贸易局揭发出了恶毒污蔑社会主义制度的右派分子张烂生。在文化系统、工会系统，也都继续揭发出了一些右派分子。有些单位在这一周中还对一些党内的右派分子展开了斗争。这些党内右派分子有市劳动局办公室科员史玉田、中共塘沽区委组织干事韩克才和天津医学院学员张志英等。
    经过这一周来的说理斗争，天津市右派分子阵线纷纷瓦解，一些右派分子在被孤立起来以后已经彻底投降。据高等学校的统计，到目前为止，在已经进行批判的教职员中的右派分子，已有三分之二缴械投降。财经贸易系统、政法系统的右派分子，也有将近三分之一作了比较老实的交代。市内各区也已经有四十七个右派分子低头认罪。
    经过斗争的锻炼，群众普遍提高了觉悟和辨明是非的能力。许多人不仅在辩论中勇敢地同右派分子针锋相对，驳得右派分子哑口无言，而且积极地调查右派分子的言行为斗争提供材料。
