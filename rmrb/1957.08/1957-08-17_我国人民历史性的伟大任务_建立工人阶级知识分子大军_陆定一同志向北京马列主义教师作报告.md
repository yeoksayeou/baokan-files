(Beijing Daily News) Comrade Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, stated yesterday at the Beijing Marxist-Leninist Teachers' Report Meeting that the anti-Rightist struggle is of great significance. This is a great socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The socialist revolution that changed the ownership of the means of production on the economic front in 1956 alone is not enough to consolidate socialism. There must also be a thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts.

Comrade Lu Dingyi made the report to all Marxist-Leninist teachers and Party propaganda workers in schools, government offices, military units, and other organizations in the Beijing area at the invitation of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. More than 5,600 people attended the report. Comrade Lu Dingyi elaborated in detail on the current situation and significance of the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification campaign, and called on Marxist-Leninist teachers and other intellectuals to strive to be intellectuals of the working class.

Comrade Lu Dingyi said that criticizing the Rightists is a struggle that concerns the survival of the socialist cause and the nation, a struggle that concerns the direction in which the country will develop in the future, and a struggle that concerns the vital interests of everyone. We must carry the anti-Rightist struggle through to the end, strive for a complete victory, and never give up halfway.

Lu Dingyi said that history has proven that in China, there are only two roads: either New Democracy and Socialism to Communism, or colonialism and semi-colonialism. There is no middle road or third line. The so-called middle road is the capitalist road, which is impossible to realize in China. In the twentieth century, in the era when capitalism developed into imperialism, the weak and vacillating Chinese national bourgeoisie did not have the strength to overthrow the imperialist rule over China, did not have the strength to defeat this powerful enemy, and was not qualified to lead the bourgeois democratic revolution; only the New Democratic Revolution led by the proletariat could overthrow the imperialist rule in China, and only the proletariat could lead China's bourgeois democratic revolution. China's bourgeois democratic revolution must be led by the proletariat, and China's socialist revolution can only be led by the proletariat. The socialist revolution aims to eliminate the bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie is not even qualified to exist in a socialist society. Bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals can only smoothly pass through the socialist stage by working hard to transform themselves under the leadership of the proletariat.

Lu Dingyi said that the so-called taking the middle road is often an excuse for betraying the revolution. This was the case during the democratic revolution. When Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei began to betray the revolution, they also used taking the middle road as a guise. During the socialist revolution, engaging in the middle road means overturning the already basically completed socialist revolution, reversing China back to a colony or semi-colony, and allowing imperialism and counter-revolution to restore themselves. The rampant attacks of the Rightists this time clearly illustrate this point. On the one hand, they shouted everywhere for absolute freedom, and on the other hand, they shouted for killing Communists. They wanted the absolute freedom to kill Communists. Isn't this clearly a counter-revolutionary restoration?

Lu Dingyi emphasized that the aim of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks is to overthrow China's proletarian dictatorship. He said that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of political power. Since 1949, we have established a proletarian dictatorship. Relying on this political power, we carried out the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations. This aroused great hatred among the bourgeois Rightists. The bourgeois Rightists understand that they have no hope of seizing political power through elections, so they especially admire the Hungarian incident. The Rightists inside and outside the Party want to create a Hungarian incident in China as well. They attempt to first seize leadership over intellectuals and the business community, and then seize national leadership. They hope that students will cause trouble, the world will be in chaos, and then they will "clean up the mess." This is why they attacked so rampantly during the period of great blooming and contending.

Lu Dingyi said that we adopted the method of national debate to shatter the rampant attacks of the bourgeois Rightists. Our Party correctly estimated that the vast majority of the people support socialism and the leadership of the proletariat, and the result is indeed so. The facts in the anti-Rightist struggle prove that not only workers, peasants, and other laborers are on our side, but also the majority of industrialists and business people and intellectuals support socialism. The national debate has greatly raised the awareness of the people. The bourgeois Rightists have been completely isolated. The current task is to deepen the struggle and achieve complete victory.

Lu Dingyi emphasized that creating a broad contingent of working-class intellectuals is a great task that history has presented to us.

He said that to build socialism in China, a country with 600 million people, there must be a contingent of working-class intellectuals; otherwise, socialism cannot be built.

In order to build socialism, the working class must have its own technical cadre team, its own professors, teachers, scientists, journalists, writers, artists, and Marxist theorists. This new team includes all intellectuals from the old society who have truly transformed themselves and stood firmly on the working-class stand.

Lu Dingyi said that striving to be a working-class intellectual means having working-class ideas and opposing bourgeois ideas.

Working-class ideology is the ideology of wholeheartedly serving the people, while bourgeois ideology is selfishness.

Individualism, departmentalism, absolute egalitarianism, liberalism, anarchism, and nationalism are all bourgeois ideologies, the root of which is selfishness.

Lu Dingyi said that whether or not one has working-class ideology is manifested in theory and in practical life, and whether or not one can stand firmly on the working-class stand and struggle against bourgeois ideology.

He said that in a socialist society, there are two different routes for cultivating intellectuals. The results will be two different kinds of intellectuals.

Cultivating intellectuals according to the bourgeois route, making them detached from the masses, detached from reality, and detached from the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations, will create bourgeois intellectuals. These intellectuals are full of selfish ideas, vying for fame and profit, and become arrogant and conceited as soon as they achieve something. They can only accept praise and cannot accept criticism. These people can recite Marxist-Leninist books, but when it comes to actual struggle, they become bourgeois Rightists. This method of cultivating intellectuals seems to "love" intellectuals on the surface, but in fact, it harms them. If we adopt this route, we will not be able to create a broad contingent of working-class intellectuals, and we will not be able to realize the great task that history has presented to us.

Lu Dingyi said that we must take another route, the proletarian route. Only by allowing intellectuals to combine with workers and peasants, go to work, go to the masses, and be constantly subjected to the leadership and supervision of the Party's grassroots organizations, and the more knowledgeable and accomplished they are, the more they respect the Party's leadership, and the more modest and prudent they are, can we cultivate working-class intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve the people. This is the true way to love intellectuals.

Lu Dingyi called on all Marxist-Leninist teachers to first be revolutionaries and Marxist propagandists. For the benefit of the socialist cause, stand firmly on the working-class stand and actively participate in the great socialist revolutionary movement on the political and ideological fronts. Be determined to be a working-class intellectual.

    我国人民历史性的伟大任务
    建立工人阶级知识分子大军
    陆定一同志向北京马列主义教师作报告
    本报讯  据北京日报消息：中共中央宣传部陆定一部长昨天在北京马列主义教师报告会上说，反右派斗争有很重大的意义。这是一个在政治战线上和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命。光有1956年在经济战线上的改变生产资料所有制的社会主义革命，社会主义还不能巩固。还必须有一个政治战线上和一个思想战线上的彻底的社会主义革命。
    陆定一同志是应中共北京市委宣传部的邀请，向北京地区的学校、机关、军队等单位的全体马列主义教师与党的宣传工作人员作报告的。听报告的共五千六百多人。陆定一同志详细地阐述了当前反右派斗争与整风运动的形势和意义，号召马列主义教师和其他知识分子努力做一个工人阶级的知识分子。
    陆定一同志说，批判右派是关系社会主义事业和国家民族生死存亡的斗争，是关系国家前途向什么方向发展的斗争，是关系每一个人的切身利害的斗争。我们必须把反右派斗争进行到底，争取彻底的胜利，决不半途而废。
    陆定一说，历史证明了，在中国，只有两条道路：或者是新民主主义、社会主义到共产主义，或者是殖民地、半殖民地。中间道路、第三条路线是没有的。所谓中间路线、中间道路就是资本主义道路，这条道路在中国是不可能实现的。在二十世纪，资本主义发展到帝国主义的时代，软弱动摇的中国民族资产阶级没有力量推翻帝国主义对中国的统治，没有力量战胜这强大的敌人，没有资格领导资产阶级民主革命；只有无产阶级领导的新民主主义革命才能推翻帝国主义在中国的统治，只有无产阶级才能领导中国的资产阶级民主革命。中国的资产阶级民主革命，尚且非由无产阶级来领导不可，中国的社会主义革命当然只有无产阶级才有资格来领导。社会主义革命要消灭资产阶级，资产阶级在社会主义社会连存在都没有资格。资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子，只有在无产阶级领导之下，努力改造自己，才能平稳地渡过社会主义这一关。
    陆定一说，所谓走中间路线，常常就是背叛革命的借口。在民主革命时期是如此，蒋介石、汪精卫开始叛变革命的时候，也曾经以走中间路线做幌子。在社会主义革命时期，搞中间路线，就是要对已经基本完成的社会主义革命进行翻案的倒算，把中国倒退到殖民地半殖民地，让帝国主义和反革命复辟。这次右派分子的猖狂进攻也清楚地说明了这个道理。他们一面到处高呼要绝对自由，一面高呼杀共产党人。他们要有杀共产党人的绝对自由。这不是明明要来一个反革命复辟么？
    陆定一着重指出：资产阶级的猖狂进攻，目的就是要推翻我国的无产阶级专政。他说，革命的根本问题是政权问题。我们从1949年起建立了无产阶级专政的政权。依靠这个政权进行了五大运动、三大改造。这就引起了资产阶级右派分子的极大仇恨。资产阶级右派分子懂得，经过竞选的办法他们是根本没有希望夺取政权的，所以他们特别欣赏匈牙利事件。党内党外的右派分子很想在中国也来一个匈牙利事件，他们企图首先夺取对知识分子和工商界的领导权，然后夺取全国的领导权。他们希望学生闹事，天下大乱，然后由他们来“收拾残局”。这就是他们在大放大鸣时期为什么那末猖狂进攻的原因。
    陆定一说，我们采取了全国人民大辩论的方法，粉碎了资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻。我们的党正确地估计到，人民的绝大多数是赞成社会主义，拥护无产阶级的领导的，而结果也的确是这样，反右派斗争中的事实证明，不但工人、农民和其他劳动者是站在我们这一面的，而且工商业者与知识分子的大多数人也是赞成社会主义的。全国人民在大辩论中大大地提高了觉悟。资产阶级右派已经完全孤立起来。现在的任务是要把斗争深入下去，取得完全的胜利。
    陆定一强调地说，要造成一个工人阶级的知识分子的广大队伍，这是历史向我们提出的伟大任务。
    他说，在六万万人民的中国要建设社会主义，必须有一支工人阶级的知识分子队伍，否则，社会主义是建不成的。
    为了建成社会主义，工人阶级必须有自己的技术干部的队伍，必须有自己的教授、教员、科学家、新闻记者、文学家、艺术家和马克思主义理论家的队伍。这个新队伍，包含从旧社会过来的真正经过改造站稳了工人阶级立场的一切知识分子。
    陆定一说，努力做一个工人阶级知识分子，就是要有工人阶级思想，反对资产阶级思想。
    工人阶级思想就是全心全意为人民服务的思想，资产阶级思想就是自私自利。
    个人主义、本位主义、绝对平均主义、自由主义、无政府主义、民族主义都是资产阶级思想，其根源都是自私自利。
    陆定一说，有没有工人阶级思想，就表现在理论上和实际生活中，能不能站稳工人阶级立场，与资产阶级思想斗争。
    他说，在社会主义社会里，培养知识分子可以有两种不同的路线。其结果会培养出两种不同的知识分子。
    照着资产阶级的路线去培养，使知识分子脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离党的基层组织的领导，就会造成资产阶级知识分子。这种知识分子充满自私自利的思想，争名夺利，稍有成就就目中无人，骄傲自大。只能受赞扬而受不得批评。这种人可以背诵马列主义的书本，但是一到实际斗争中，却成了资产阶级右派分子。这种培养知识分子的方法，表面上似乎是“爱护”知识分子，实际上却是害了他们。采用这样的路线，我们就无法造成工人阶级知识分子的广大队伍，就无法实现历史向我们提出的伟大任务。
    陆定一说，我们要采取另一条路线，无产阶级的路线。只有让知识分子与工农相结合，到工作中去，到群众中去，经常受到党的基层组织的领导和群众的监督，越是有学问有成就就越是尊重党的领导，越是谦虚谨慎。只有这样才能锻炼培养出工人阶级的知识分子，全心全意为人民服务的知识分子。这样做，也才是真正爱护知识分子。
    陆定一号召所有马列主义教师，首先做个革命家、做个马克思主义宣传家。为了社会主义事业的利益，站稳工人阶级立场，积极参加政治战线和思想战线上的伟大的社会主义革命运动。立志做一个工人阶级知识分子。
