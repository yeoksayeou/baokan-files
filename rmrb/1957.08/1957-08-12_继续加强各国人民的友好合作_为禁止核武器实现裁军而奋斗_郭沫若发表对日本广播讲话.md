Xinhua News Agency, August 11th: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Chairman of the Chinese Preparatory Committee for the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, delivered a broadcast speech to Japan today. The full text is as follows:

    The Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament opened in Tokyo, Japan on August 6th. This once again demonstrates the common will of the Japanese people and the people of all countries to resolutely oppose nuclear weapons, demand an end to the arms race, and safeguard peace. On behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese Preparatory Committee for the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, I extend warm congratulations to the conference. I firmly believe that this conference will further mobilize the peace forces from all aspects of the world, more actively demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons, strive for early disarmament, and thereby make significant contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    In recent years, the intensification of the atomic arms race and the continuous nuclear weapons testing have increasingly seriously threatened world peace and human security, and their impact will be detrimental to future generations of mankind. The broad masses of people around the world and the parliaments and governments of many countries are demanding a halt to the testing and a ban on the use of nuclear weapons, and are demanding an end to the atomic arms race. The voices are rising and have formed an irresistible force for peace.

    As everyone knows, the Soviet Union, which possesses nuclear weapons, strongly advocates banning the use and testing of nuclear weapons and hopes to reach an international agreement on this issue as soon as possible. Recently, at the London Disarmament Conference, the Soviet Union once again put forward a number of practical and feasible disarmament proposals, including a proposal to stop nuclear weapons testing within two to three years. Although these proposals have been widely approved and supported by world public opinion, they have been obstructed by certain Western countries.

    Western countries, primarily the United States, are not sincere about banning the use and testing of nuclear weapons and reducing conventional armaments. In order to maintain the excessive profits of bloody military production and to enslave the people of the world, the warmongers in the United States are still determined to promote the policy of expanding atomic armaments, expanding atomic bases and storing missiles in various parts of the world, including Japan, preparing for atomic war, and intensifying international tensions. Not long ago, the United States government openly stationed missile troops in China's territory of Taiwan and threatened to use missiles to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and attacking the Chinese people. At the same time, it continues to import atomic equipment and new weapons into Japan and southern Korea.

    Clearly, the threat of atomic war from the United States has become a real problem that seriously threatens peace and security in Asia and the world today.

    This aggressive behavior of the United States government is increasingly arousing the indignation and protest of the people of all countries. The people of all countries have widely launched various forms of struggle against the American conspiracy to launch an atomic war.

    The Japanese people have suffered multiple disasters from atomic weapons and nuclear weapons. Based on their own painful experiences, they have always stood at the forefront of the movement against weapons of mass destruction. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to the Japanese people—the hosts of this conference—and once again express my deep concern and condolences to the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and other disaster victims.

    However, I must point out here with great regret that the current attitude of the Japanese government is completely contrary to that of the Japanese people and is taking another dangerous path. Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has openly stated that Japan possessing atomic weapons does not violate the constitution. Especially after Nobusuke Kishi's visit to the United States, the Japanese government has more clearly and directly entered the American atomic strategy system. It is said that the Japanese Defense Agency is asking the United States to obtain six types of missiles capable of launching atomic warheads. Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has also recently made many remarks hostile to the Chinese people. These practices of the Japanese government are obviously not in line with the strong desires of the broad masses of the Japanese people to oppose nuclear weapons, demand peace, and demand friendship with the Chinese people. There is no doubt that this is also very detrimental to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    We Chinese people have consistently advocated banning the use and testing of nuclear weapons, ending the arms race, and using atomic energy for peaceful purposes to benefit mankind. We are willing to continue to strengthen friendly cooperation with the Japanese people and the people of all countries in the world, work more closely together to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and jointly strive against the testing and use of nuclear weapons, for the early realization of universal disarmament, and for ensuring peace in Asia and the world.

    In the name of the Chinese people, I pay tribute to the friends from all countries attending this conference and wish the conference to make new contributions to enhancing the happiness of mankind.

### 继续加强各国人民的友好合作  为禁止核武器实现裁军而奋斗  郭沫若发表对日本广播讲话

    继续加强各国人民的友好合作
    为禁止核武器实现裁军而奋斗
    郭沫若发表对日本广播讲话
    新华社11日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席，第三届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取裁军世界大会中国筹备委员会主席郭沫若，今天发表对日本广播讲话。全文如下：
    第三届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取裁军世界大会于8月6日在日本东京开幕了。这再一次表示出日本人民和世界各国人民坚决反对原子核武器、要求停止军备竞赛和保卫和平的共同意志。我代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和第三届禁止原子弹、氢弹和争取裁军世界大会中国筹备委员会向大会热烈祝贺。我深信，这次大会将进一步动员世界各方面的和平力量，更积极地要求禁止原子核武器、争取早日实现裁军，从而为亚洲和世界和平事业作出重大的贡献。
    几年来，原子军备竞赛的加紧和核武器的不断爆炸试验，愈来愈严重地威胁着世界和平和人类安全，其影响所及，并将为害于人类后代。全世界广大人民和许多国家的议会和政府要求停止试验和禁止使用核武器、要求结束原子军备竞赛，呼声日益高涨，已经形成了一支不可抗拒的和平力量。
    大家知道，拥有核武器的苏联，是极力主张禁止核武器的使用和试验，并希望就这一问题早日达成国际协议的。最近，在伦敦裁军会议上，苏联又一次提出了各项切实可行的裁军建议，其中包括在两三年内停止核武器爆炸试验的建议。这些建议虽然得到了世界舆论的普遍的赞同和支持，但是受到了某些西方国家的阻挠。
    西方国家，首先是美国，对于禁止使用和试验核武器以及裁减常规军备，是没诚意的。美国好战分子为了维持血腥的军事生产的超额利润，企图奴役全世界人民，目前还在锐意推行扩张原子军备政策，在世界各地，包括日本在内，扩建原子基地，储贮导弹，准备进行原子战争，以加紧国际紧张局势。不久前，美国政府公然在中国的领土台湾派驻导弹部队，并且扬言要用导弹阻挠中国人民解放台湾，进攻中国人民。同时更继续把原子装备和新式武器输入日本和朝鲜南部。
    很显然，来自美国的原子战争的威胁，在今天已经成为了严重威胁亚洲及世界和平与安全的现实问题了。
    美国政府这种侵略行为，愈来愈引起各国人民的义愤和抗议。各国人民已广泛地展开了各种形式的反对美国阴谋发动原子战争的斗争。
    日本人民，曾经遭受过多次原子武器和核武器的灾害，他们根据亲身的惨痛经历，一向是站在反对大量毁灭性武器运动的最前线。我在这里要特别向日本人民——这次会议的东道主——表示敬意和感谢，并对广岛、长崎的市民和其他身受灾难者，再一次表示深切的关怀和慰问。
    但是，十分遗憾，我在这里必须明确地指出：日本政府目前的态度却同日本人民完全相反，是要走另一条危险的道路。日本首相岸信介曾公然表示日本拥有原子武器也不违反宪法。特别是在岸信介访美回国后，日本政府更明显地直接投入了美国原子战略体系，据说，日本防卫厅正在向美国要求得到能够发射原子弹头的六种导弹。岸信介首相最近还发表了许多敌视中国人民的言论。日本政府这些作法，显然同日本广大人民群众反对核武器，要求和平、要求与中国人民友好的强烈愿望是不相符合的。毫无疑问，这对亚洲及世界和平事业，也是非常不利的。
    我们中国人民，是一贯主张禁止使用和试验核武器，主张结束军备竞赛，并主张把原子能用于为人类造福的和平目的的。我们愿意继续加强同日本人民和世界各国人民的友好合作，更加紧密地一同携起手来，克服一切困难和阻碍，为反对核武器的试验和使用，为早日实现普遍裁军，为确保亚洲和世界和平而共同奋斗。
    让我以中国人民的名义，向出席这次大会的各国朋友们致敬，并祝大会为增进人类的幸福，作出新的贡献。
