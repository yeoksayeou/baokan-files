Tang Wanru is the only athlete other than Lin Jinzhu to break a national record in this competition.

    In this competition, although Mu Xiangxiong won first place in the 200-meter breaststroke, his time was 2 minutes and 47.2 seconds, which was 3.7 seconds slower than his time of 2 minutes and 43.5 seconds at the 3rd Moscow International Youth Friendship Games.

    The men's Group A 10-meter platform diving competition, held for the first time since liberation, produced excellent results yesterday. The top three places were all won by athletes from Guangdong Province, and their scores all exceeded the standard for first-class athletes (115 points). Li Binzhen took first place with a score of 124.57 points, Chen Guoneng took second place with a score of 120.83 points, and Liang Boxi took third place with a score of 118.4 points. When they performed various somersaults and twists on the 10-meter-high platform, they received warm applause from the audience.

    After all the competitions, a diving performance was held. The most outstanding adult and youth male and female divers from this competition performed various poses and group dives.

    The People's Liberation Army team and the Shanghai team also held a water polo exhibition match after the competition.

    In the afternoon, Deng Xiaoping, He Long, Peng Zhen and other central leaders watched the swimming and diving competitions. Mayor Peng Zhen presented two gold medals to Lin Jinzhu and Tang Wanru, who broke national records in this competition.
