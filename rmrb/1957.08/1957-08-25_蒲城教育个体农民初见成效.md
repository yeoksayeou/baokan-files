　　Pucheng Education of Individual Farmers Showing Initial Success

　　(Our Report) Xi'an - After receiving political and ideological education, individual farmers in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, have raised their ideological awareness. Many have proposed to improve production, conscientiously implement state policies, and actively pay agricultural taxes and sell surplus grain.

　　After the realization of advanced agricultural cooperatives in Pucheng County, there were still 1,059 farm households remaining outside the cooperatives. The majority of them were well-to-do middle peasants and middle peasants; a few were poor peasants who were also engaged in handicrafts or lived in towns. The reasons why these farmers did not join the cooperatives were largely because they possessed good land, and had complete livestock and farm tools, and their families lived comfortably, so they thought they could manage without help; some, although their land, livestock, and furniture were not considered good, had skills or could do speculative business, and were afraid of losing "freedom" by joining the cooperatives.

　　After agricultural cooperativization, many districts and townships experienced a tendency to discriminate against and attack individual farmers. After this tendency was corrected, a right-leaning sentiment emerged, neglecting the education and management of individual farmers. They were not questioned even if they didn't pay agricultural taxes, didn't sell surplus grain, didn't perform public duties, or even broke the law. The 1,059 farmers outside the cooperatives in the county owned more than 56,400 mu of fertile land, but they paid the least in agricultural taxes and sold the least surplus grain; some even still owed a lot of grain from last year's agricultural tax and state purchase. Many farmers outside the cooperatives sold grain on the black market, or trafficked in grain. Even more were running restaurants, noodle shops, and trading livestock, pigs, and sheep. Some individual farmers also provoked cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperatives and prevented others from joining. The lack of education for farmers outside the cooperatives has caused serious dissatisfaction among agricultural cooperative members.

　　In light of the above situation, the Pucheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee recently convened a special meeting to study the issue of individual farmers, and put forward "Measures to Strengthen the Education and Management of Individual Farmers."

　　During the implementation of the management measures, all districts, townships, and cooperatives held special symposiums for individual farmers, explaining policies to them, criticizing the illegal activities of some people, and conducting a household-by-household inspection of their progress in completing agricultural tax and state purchase tasks; those who completed their tasks well were commended, and those who did not complete them well were criticized; those who resisted paying grain were given a deadline to pay. Currently, more than 50% of agricultural taxes and state purchase grain from individual farmers in the county have been put into storage. Townships and agricultural cooperatives have also helped farmers outside the cooperatives organize study groups, assigning special personnel to be responsible for conducting regular publicity and education work for them.

### 蒲城教育个体农民初见成效

　　蒲城教育个体农民初见成效
    本报讯　陕西省蒲城县个体农民受到政治思想教育以后，思想觉悟有了提高，不少人提出要搞好生产，认真执行国家的政策，积极缴纳公粮和出卖余粮。
    蒲城县实现高级农业合作化以后，还有一千零五十九户农民留在农业社外。他们大部分是富裕中农、中农，少数是兼营手工业或住在城镇的贫农。这些农民其所以不入社，一大部分是因为占有好地，牲畜、农具齐全，家庭生活富裕，认为可以不求人；有些人虽然土地、牲畜、家具并不算好，但有手艺或可以做投机生意，怕入社不“自由”。
    在农业合作化后，许多区、乡曾发生歧视和打击个体农民的偏向。这种偏向纠正以后，又发生了一种右倾情绪，忽视了对个体农民的教育和管理。他们不缴公粮、不卖余粮、不出公差甚至犯法也无人过问。全县一百零五十九户社外农民，共占有五万六千四百多亩肥沃土地，但是，他们交公粮卖余粮都是最少的，甚至去年的公粮和统购粮都还差很多没有上缴。如城关镇社外农民王树森占有五十亩好地，今年收成也不错，但应交的公购粮一粒不交，硬说没有粮食。很多社外农民在黑市上出售粮食，或贩卖粮食。开饭馆、面房和贩卖牲口、猪、羊的更多。有些个体农民还挑拨社员闹退社，阻止别人入社。由于对社外农民教育不够，已引起了农业社员的严重不满。
    根据上述情况，中共蒲城县委和县人民委员会最近专门召开会议研究个体农民的问题，提出了“加强对个体农民的教育和管理办法”。
    各区、乡、社在实施管理办法当中，都专门召开了个体农民座谈会，给他们讲解政策，批判了某些人的违法行为，对他们完成公粮和统购粮任务的情况逐户进行了检查；对完成好的进行表扬，对完成得不好的进行了批评；对那些抗粮不交的，限期让他们交纳。目前，全县个体农民的公粮和统购粮入库已达50％以上。各乡和农业社并帮助社外农民组织了学习小组，指定专人负责对他们经常进行宣传教育工作。（王建中）
