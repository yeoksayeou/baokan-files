On the Anti-Rightist Front

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch. The First Branch Hospital of Shenyang Medical College exposed the reactionary words and deeds of Wang Tianjue, a teaching assistant and Communist Party member.

    Wang came from a comprador family and had longed for the lifestyle of the imperialist pawns since childhood. He completely denied all the work done by the Party. Wang Tianjue slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as violating the constitution, slandered agricultural collectivization and the first Five-Year Plan as being rash and冒进 (lit. "rushing forward too quickly"). He also generally criticized "the organization is bureaucratic," and viciously said "bureaucracy should be shot." He even slandered that there were many errors in practical work, for which the Central Committee should be responsible, but "I have never seen the Central Committee conduct a self-criticism."

    王天爵全盘否定党的成就
    新华社专稿　沈阳医学院第一医院分院揭露助教、共产党员王天爵的反动言行。
    王出身于买办家庭，从小就向往着帝国主义爪牙的生活方式，他对党所作的一切工作，全盘否定。王天爵诬蔑肃反违反宪法，诬蔑农业合作化和第一个五年计划冒进了，他并笼统地指责“组织是官僚主义”，还恶毒地说“官僚主义应该枪毙”。甚至诬蔑说实际工作中很多错误，中央要负责任，但“从来也没见到中央检讨过”。
