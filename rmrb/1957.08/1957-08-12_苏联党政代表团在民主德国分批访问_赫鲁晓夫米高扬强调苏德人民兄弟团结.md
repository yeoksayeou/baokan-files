Xinhua News Agency, August 11th, Magdeburg dispatch from TASS: A city-wide rally was held here on August 10th to welcome a group of members of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation headed by Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev and Walter Ulbricht, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, who accompanied him, spoke at the meeting.

In his speech, Khrushchev pointed out the examples of revolutionary fraternal solidarity shown between the workers of Magdeburg and the workers of Soviet Russia in 1918 and 1920. He said: "In the struggle for socialism, the fraternal unity of the working class is a great force. We will strengthen this unity, because in our struggle for socialism and peace, it is the foundation of our present and future victories."

Khrushchev pointed out that the German Socialist Unity Party is worthy of the revolutionary traditions of the German workers' movement, which was cultivated under the direct leadership of Marx and Engels. It has built a fortress of peace and democracy in eastern Germany.

Ulbricht then spoke. He said that the people of Germany and the Soviet Union, together with their allies, are capable of stopping war, which places a great responsibility on the German working class. In addition to faithfully completing production tasks and raising the vigilance of all working people against imperialist conspiracies, it is first necessary to show the class brothers in West Germany how the working class should advance when it controls its own destiny.

Khrushchev and other members of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation, Gromyko and Pushkin, left Leipzig with Ulbricht on the morning of August 10th to visit Magdeburg.

Xinhua News Agency, August 11th, TASS dispatch: Accompanied by German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl, some members of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation, led by Mikoyan, visited the Rostock District on August 9th and 10th.

On the evening of August 10th, a grand mass rally was held in the city of Rostock to welcome the Soviet Party and Government Delegation.

In his speech at the meeting, Mikoyan said that the friendship between the Soviet people and the people of the German Democratic Republic is eternal and unbreakable, and no conspiracy of the enemy can damage or shake this friendship. The Soviet Union hopes to establish such friendly relations with the German people living in the Federal Republic of Germany. However, the ruling group in West Germany is doing everything possible to prevent the establishment of such friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The attitude taken by the delegation of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany during the negotiations in Moscow clearly proves this point.

German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl also spoke at the welcoming rally.

On August 10th, Mikoyan and his party also visited the "Warnow Shipyard" in Warnemünde, Rostock District, and held discussions with the leaders and activists of the enterprise.

    苏联党政代表团在民主德国分批访问
    赫鲁晓夫米高扬强调苏德人民兄弟团结
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社马格德堡讯：这里在8月10日举行了全市性的大会，欢迎以苏联共产党中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联党政代表团的一批团员。赫鲁晓夫和陪同前来的德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希在大会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中指出马格德堡工人和苏维埃俄国工人之间在1918和1920年所表现的革命的兄弟团结的范例，他说：“在争取社会主义的斗争中，工人阶级的兄弟般的团结一致是伟大的力量。我们将加强这种团结，因为在我们争取社会主义和和平的斗争中，它是我们目前和未来的胜利的基础。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，德国统一社会党是无愧于在马克思和恩格斯直接领导下锻炼出来的德国工人运动的革命传统的。它已经在德国东部建成了一个和平和民主的堡垒。
    乌布利希接着讲话。他说，德国和苏联两国人民及其盟邦一起是能够制止战争的，这就使德国工人阶级担负了重大的责任。除了忠实地完成生产任务和提高全体劳动人民对帝国主义阴谋的警惕外，首先需要向西德的阶级兄弟表明，工人阶级在掌握了自己的命运时应该怎样地前进。
    赫鲁晓夫和苏联党和政府代表团其他团员葛罗米柯和普希金是在10日上午同乌布利希一起离开来比锡到达马格德堡市参观访问的。
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联党和政府代表团部分团员在米高扬率领下8月9日和10日由德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥陪同在罗斯托克专区进行了参观和访问。
    8月10日晚间，在罗斯托克城举行了盛大的群众大会，欢迎苏联党和政府代表团。
    米高扬在会上的讲话中说，苏联人民和德意志民主共和国人民的友谊是永恒的，是牢不可破的，敌人的任何阴谋都不能使这种友谊受到破坏或动摇。苏联希望同住在德意志联邦共和国的德国人民也能建立起这种友好关系。但是，西德的统治集团用尽一切办法来阻挠同苏联建立这种友好关系。德意志联邦共和国政府代表团在莫斯科进行谈判时所采取的态度就清楚地证明了这点。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在欢迎大会上也讲了话。
    米高扬等一行人8月10日在罗斯托克专区的瓦内蒙德还参观了“瓦诺夫造船厂”，并且同这个企业的领导人和积极分子进行了座谈。
