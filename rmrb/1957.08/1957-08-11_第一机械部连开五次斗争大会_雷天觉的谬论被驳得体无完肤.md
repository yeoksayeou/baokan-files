    The First Ministry of Machine Building Held Five Consecutive Struggle Sessions
    Lei Tianjue's Fallacies Thoroughly Refuted
    (Our Newspaper reports) The First Ministry of Machine Building recently held five consecutive reasoning struggle sessions to severely criticize the rightist element Lei Tianjue from the engineering and technical field.
    The conference first forcefully refuted Lei Tianjue's absurd claim that the Party should be above or within the state. Zhang Baoquan, Chief Engineer of the Third Bureau, pointed out that Article 1 of our Constitution clearly stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." The Party is the vanguard of the working class, so the state is led by the working class through the Party. It is the working class leading itself and managing itself. Where does the question of "above" or "within" come from? Everyone questioned Lei Tianjue: "You are a People's Representative, and you raised your hand to pass the Constitution. Don't you even understand this fundamental issue?" Lei Tianjue even arrogantly demanded a public opinion poll on this issue. Everyone said, "If you want a public opinion poll, the fact that the Constitution was passed at the People's Congress is the best public opinion poll." At the meeting, Lei Tianjue's fallacies of demanding a change in the proportion of Party members among enterprise leaders and providing preferential treatment in wages to "old cadres" instead of based on their positions were also criticized. He Ju, Director of the Sales Bureau, pointed out in his speech that his so-called preferential treatment for old cadres through wages rather than positions was essentially using a "redemption" policy to force Party members and old cadres to step down. Everyone pointed out that his reactionary clamor was exactly the same as Chu Anping's "Party's world" and Yang Yuqing's "step down from the sedan chair."
    Han Yuanzuo, Chief Engineer of the First Design Bureau, Wang Zixin, Engineer of the Locomotive Research Institute, and others, based on their experiences in studying in England and the United States, exposed the essence of the so-called democracy, occupational freedom, freedom of speech, and freedom of thought in capitalist countries that Lei Tianjue promoted. They questioned Lei Tianjue: In England and the United States, millions of people are unemployed, and university professors have to sell tickets in parks during vacations to make ends meet. Is this what they voluntarily do?! Is this "occupational freedom"? Engineer Luo Shiyu said: In 1946, 700,000 people in a certain state in the United States jointly accused a senator, but he was not brought down because he had a powerful boss behind him. In our country, every letter from the people is carefully investigated and dealt with. Which is truly democratic? Wang Zixin said that Powell, the editor of the American "Millar's Review," reflected some true situations about reporting on the new China and was persecuted by the American government. Lei Tianjue, on the other hand, has been cultivated and given important responsibilities by the Party for eight years, but he has been anti-Party and anti-socialist all along. He has said so many reactionary remarks for so long, but the Communist Party has not only not locked him up, but has also been giving him important responsibilities, caring for him, and educating him. Isn't his speech and thought "free" enough?
    Lei Tianjue said: There are three kinds of ideological education: one is to make people submit to the truth; the second is to cultivate conditioned reflexes; and the third is to have the reality of compulsory education without the appearance of compulsory education. He categorically slandered that our ideological education is mostly the third kind, and also said that it is like selling plasters at the City God Temple in Shanghai. Everyone used a large number of facts to prove that our Party has always only taken the dissemination of the truth of Marxism-Leninism as its responsibility. Everyone also ridiculed Lei Tianjue himself as a person who has been truly corroded by capitalist conditioned reflexes and has been peddling capitalist quack medicine for a long time.
    In order to negate the achievements of socialist construction and oppose the Soviet Union, Lei Tianjue insisted that technology had shrunk after 1952-53. At the meeting, a letter from Ai Ding, Director of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory (formerly the Shanghai Qiujiang Machine Factory, the factory that Lei boasted about), was read, saying: "Since Lei Tianjue, this stumbling block to progress, left, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the earnest learning of advanced Soviet experience, with the efforts of the factory's employees, the factory's new machine tool products have increased to twenty-six types from 1954 to now, and can be increased to thirty-three types by the end of this year." Everyone also listed many ironclad facts to prove that our country's technological level has greatly improved.
    Engineers Luo Shiyu, Lian Zhongjing, Wu Pei and others all said that Lei Tianjue often showed himself to be omniscient, but in reality, he was stealing fame and deceiving the world. He once presided over the design of the sluice gates on the Huai River project and adopted a balanced pressure device. Due to a lack of practical experience, the gates were difficult to open after they were built, which is one example.
    Everyone unanimously demanded that he thoroughly confess his reactionary words and deeds, as well as his relationship with the rightist leaders Qian Weichang, Pu Xixiu, and others.

### 第一机械部连开五次斗争大会  雷天觉的谬论被驳得体无完肤

    第一机械部连开五次斗争大会
    雷天觉的谬论被驳得体无完肤
    本报讯　第一机械工业部最近先后举行了五次说理斗争大会，痛击工程技术界的右派分子雷天觉。
    大会首先对雷天觉所谓的党究竟应在国家之上，还是应在国家之中的荒谬说法作了有力驳斥。三局总工程师张宝全指出，我国宪法第一条明文规定：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家”。而党是工人阶级的先锋队，因此国家是工人阶级通过党领导的，是自己领导自己，自己管理自己，有什么“之上”“之中”的问题？大家质问雷天觉：“你是人民代表，宪法是你举手通过的，难道连这个根本问题还没搞清？”雷天觉甚至狂妄地要求就这个问题来个民意测验，大家说：“你如果要来个民意测验，宪法在人民代表大会上被通过就是最好的民意测验。”会上对雷天觉要求在企业领导人员中改变党员比例，对“老干部”可以工资待遇照顾，不要以岗位照顾的谬论也作了批判。销售局处长何惧同志发言中指出：他的所谓不要用岗位、而用工资待遇照顾老干部，实质上是用“赎买”政策要党员、老干部下台。大家指出他这种反动叫嚣和储安平的“党天下”，杨玉清的“下台下轿”如出一辙。
    设计一分局总工程师韩元佐、机车研究所工程师王自新等在发言中，以自己在英、美留学时所见所闻，揭穿了雷天觉宣扬的所谓资本主义国家的民主和职业自由、言论自由、思想自由的实质。他们质问雷天觉：在英国美国，千百万人失业，大学教授为了维持温饱不得不在假期到公园里卖票，难道这是他们志愿干的吗？！这就是“职业自由”吗？工程师罗士瑜说：1946年在美国某州有七十万人联名控告一个参议员，却没有告下台，因为他有后台老板；而在我国对一封人民来信都要认真地调查处理，究竟那个才是民主？王自新说美国“密勒氏评论报”主编鲍威尔反映了报道新中国的一些真实情况，就受到美国政府的迫害。而雷天觉八年以来，一直受到党的培养重用，但他却一直反党反社会主义，说了那么久那么多的反动言论，共产党不但没有把他关起来，而且一直在重用他，爱护和教育他，难道他的言论思想，还不够“自由”吗？
    雷天觉说：思想教育有三种：一种是使人服从真理；第二种是培养条件反射；第三种是有强迫教育之实而无强迫教育之痕迹。他断然污蔑说我们的思想教育是第三种最多，还说和上海城隍庙卖膏药一样大家用大量事实证明，我们党从来只以宣传马克思列宁主义的真理为己任。大家并嘲笑雷天觉本人才真正是被资本主义条件反射所腐蚀、长期兜售着资本主义狗皮膏药的分子。
    为了否定社会主义建设成就和反对苏联。雷天觉硬说1952.53年以后技术萎缩了。大会上宣读了上海机床厂（原上海虬江机器厂，即雷自吹赖以成名的工厂）厂长艾丁来信说：“该厂自雷天觉这个阻碍进步的绊脚石走了以后，由于党的正确领导和由于认真学习了苏联先进经验，在该厂职工努力之下，该厂机床新产品从1954年到现在已经增加到二十六种，到今年年底可增加到三十三种”。大家并列举许多铁一般的事实，证明我国技术水平是大大的提高了。
    工程师罗士瑜、连忠静、武霈等都说：雷天觉经常表现自己无所不知，实际上是在盗名欺世。他曾主持设计过治淮工程上的闸门，采用平衡压力装置，由于实际经验不够，造出来不好开动，就是一例。
    大家一致要求他必须彻底交代自己的反动言行，以及和钱伟长、浦熙修等右派头目的关系。
