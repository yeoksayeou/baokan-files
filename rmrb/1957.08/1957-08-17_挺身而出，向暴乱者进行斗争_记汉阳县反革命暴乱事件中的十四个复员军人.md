    Standing Up and Fighting the Rioters
    Remembering Fourteen Demobilized Soldiers in the Counter-Revolutionary Riot in Hanyang County
    In the counter-revolutionary riot at Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School, instigated by Ma Zemin, a major figure of the Zhang-Luo Alliance stationed in Wuhan, fourteen demobilized soldiers, including Zhang Xuewan and Ye Huaqing, stepped forward and resolutely fought the rioters.
    These fourteen demobilized soldiers had just returned to their hometowns from the border and coastal defenses of the motherland, as well as from Korea, and were waiting for work assignments at the Hanyang County Transfer and Construction Committee. When the counter-revolutionary group headed by Wang Jianguo, the vice principal of Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School, acting on Ma Zemin's secret instructions, used the issue of school enrollment to create rumors and ignite the situation, inciting students to put up reactionary slogans, destroy public property, and tie up government staff, these demobilized soldiers waiting for assignments immediately realized that this was not a simple "school enrollment" issue.
    On the morning of the second day of the counter-revolutionary riot (June 13), these fourteen demobilized soldiers held an emergency meeting. They said that as demobilized soldiers, they had a duty to defend the motherland at all times and would never allow anyone to oppose the Communist Party or the People's Government. They bought paper and wrote slogans denouncing the counter-revolutionaries for creating riots. They wrote on the slogans: "We oppose kidnapping, oppose infringing on human rights, and oppose insulting the leaders of the Party and government!" "We oppose destroying state property!"
    When these fourteen demobilized soldiers heard that the students were making trouble at the County People's Committee, they immediately rushed there. Zhang Xuewan, who had been awarded a third-class merit in Korea and had been wounded, saw a student posting a reactionary slogan insulting the county magistrate. He ran up, twisted the person posting the slogan to the side, and tore down the slogan. When the students, incited to participate in the riot, surrounded the county magistrate,嚣张 shouted and clamored to beat him, and tied up the two cadres protecting the county magistrate, Zhang Xuewan bravely broke through the encirclement and held onto the county magistrate tightly. When a bad element raised his hand to strike the county magistrate, he shielded him with his own body. When the county magistrate was taken by the students to Hanyang No. 1 Middle School, he still followed closely to protect him. Ye Huaqing, a second-class disabled soldier, also limped along with the others to protect the county magistrate, preventing the rioters from behaving rudely. Later, they also protected the county magistrate and answered the students' questions in the auditorium of No. 1 Middle School. After this, the fourteen demobilized soldiers posted counter-attack slogans in the classrooms and in the places where the rioters gathered, exposing the counter-revolutionary conspiracy in public. When the slogans posted by Zhang Xuewan, Wen Xinyuan, and Jin Mingzao were torn down by a student, they forced the student to put them back up. At this time, Yang Songtao, the director of teaching affairs and a core member of the counter-revolutionary group at No. 1 Middle School, came forward to interfere, slandering the demobilized soldiers and attempting to incite the demobilized soldiers to support them. Zhang Xuewan and others immediately refuted him. Wang Honghu, a demobilized soldier who had just returned from Korea, said to the students: "We risked our lives to resist American imperialism for socialism and to defend the construction of the motherland, but you are following the counter-revolutionaries to oppose the Party and oppose the government!" More than twenty students lowered their heads and slipped away. Zhang Xuewan also debated with the students for more than four hours in a teahouse with workers and peasants. Ye Zhili, a demobilized soldier, said in the debate: "Since liberation, the county has established eight or nine middle schools, and so many students are studying. How can you follow the counter-revolutionaries to make trouble! In the old society, would so many people have been able to study?" Some of the students were so ashamed that they shed tears.

    挺身而出，向暴乱者进行斗争
    记汉阳县反革命暴乱事件中的十四个复员军人
    在章罗联盟驻武汉的大员马哲民策动下的汉阳县第一中学的反革命暴乱事件中，张学万、叶华青等十四个复员军人，挺身而出，向暴乱者进行了坚决斗争。
    这十四个复员军人，是刚从祖国边防、海防以及从朝鲜复员回到故乡的，他们正在汉阳县转业建设委员会等待分配工作。当以汉阳县一中副校长王建国为首的反革命集团，根据马哲民的秘密指示，利用升学问题造谣点火，把学生煽动起来，贴反动标语、捣毁公物、捆打政府工作人员的时候，这些正在等待分配工作的复员军人们，立即发现这不是一个简单的“升学”问题。
    在反革命暴乱的第二天（6月13日）早上，这十四个复员军人召开了紧急会议。他们说，我们是复员战士，任何时候都有保卫祖国的义务，绝不容许有人反对共产党、反对人民政府。他们买纸张写了标语，声讨反革命制造暴乱。他们在标语上写道：“我们反对绑架，反对侵犯人权，反对侮辱党和政府的首长！”“我们反对破坏国家财产！”
    这十四个复员军人听说学生闹到县人民委员会去，也马上赶去。曾经在朝鲜立过三等功、负过伤的张学万，看到一个学生张贴辱骂县长的反动标语，他跑上去将贴标语的人扭到一边，撕下了标语。当被煽动参加暴乱的学生把县长包围起来，嚣张地乱吼喊打，并把保护县长的两个干部捆起来的时候，张学万勇敢地闯进重围，紧紧地扶着县长。一个坏蛋举手向县长打来，他便以自己的身体遮挡住。当县长被学生拥到汉阳一中，他仍紧紧地跟随保卫。二等一级残废军人叶华青也一拐一拐地跟着其余的人一起保护县长，使暴乱者不敢施展无礼举动。后来他们又保卫着县长，在一中大礼堂答复了学生们提出的问题。此后，十四个复员军人分别在教室以及暴乱者集中的地方贴出反击的标语，当众揭穿反革命的阴谋。张学万、文馨远、金明早贴的标语被一个学生撕去，他们迫使那个学生重新贴上。这时，一中反革命集团的骨干——教导副主任杨松涛出面干涉，污蔑复员军人，并企图煽动复员军人支持他们。张学万等人立即给以驳斥。刚从朝鲜回来的复员军人汪洪湖对学生们说：“我们为了社会主义，为了保卫祖国建设，出生入死地抗击美帝国主义，你们却跟着反革命分子反党反政府！”有二十多个学生，被他说得当场低着头溜走了。张学万还在一个茶馆里和工人、农民一起，同学生们辩论了四个多小时。复员军人叶志理在辩论中说：“解放以后，县里建立了八、九所中学，有这么多学生读书，你们竟跟着反革命闹事！在旧社会里，能有这么多人读书吗？”一部分学生被他说得惭愧地流下眼泪来。        （新华社稿）
