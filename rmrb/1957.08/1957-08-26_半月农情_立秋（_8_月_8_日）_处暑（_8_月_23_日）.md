　　Half-Monthly Agricultural Situation
　　Beginning of Autumn (August 8th) – End of Heat (August 23rd)
　　Although there is an old saying in the north, "After the Beginning of Autumn, hang up the hoe," this year the farmers here have not reduced their agricultural activities because of the Beginning of Autumn. Farmers in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong and other provinces have been fighting drought tensely since early August. Farmers in some areas have achieved some results in fighting drought and protecting autumn crops, irrigating a large number of drought-stricken autumn fields, and newly building many small-scale water conservancy projects in the fight against drought. Farmers in the Northeast are busy with "loosening the autumn ridges and pulling out big weeds" during this stage; Farmers in Liaoning, in addition to the field management mentioned above to promote early maturity of crops, also carried out the arduous task of eliminating sorghum aphids, saving more than 1 million hectares of sorghum.

　　The period after the "Beginning of Autumn" and before the "End of Heat" is the time when spring-sown corn, sorghum, millet and other crops mature in the northern regions. Flax in Inner Mongolia and other places is also harvested at this time. This year, the spring-sown miscellaneous grain crops in these areas are generally growing well. According to preliminary estimates from five counties in Henan (Queshan, Shangcai, Pingyu, Suiping, and Runan), sorghum can produce an average of 180 jin per mu, millet can produce about 300 jin, and corn yield may be more than 400 jin.
    Most of the summer-sown corn and millet in the northern region are growing normally, but some are threatened by drought. Summer-sown corn and millet that are growing normally begin to tassel in mid-August. Crops in disaster areas in Anhui and other provinces are also growing well.
                      ※
　　Approximately 200 million mu of intermediate rice in the southern provinces have been harvested during this period. The yield of intermediate rice in some areas is slightly lower due to drought, but the normal year's intermediate rice has increased compared with last year. The 7.21 million mu of intermediate rice in the Jingzhou Special Zone of Hubei Province has generally had a bumper harvest. The 310,000 mu of intermediate rice in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area of this special zone has an average yield of 540 jin per mu, an increase of more than 30% compared with last year.
　　The single-season late rice in the southern region began to tassel around August 15th, and the double-season late rice has generally undergone its first cultivation. Judging from the crop pest and disease forecasts in some areas, the rice stem borer, *Chilo suppressalis*, which harms late rice, is relatively serious this year. In some areas of Sichuan this year, there are ten times more rice moths than last year.
                    ※
　　Large-scale autumn harvests will begin one after another after the "White Dew" period. Many areas will follow the autumn harvest with autumn planting. Preparations for the autumn harvest and autumn planting began in many areas as early as after the "Beginning of Autumn", generally slightly earlier than last year.
　　In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year, many areas have carried out work such as accumulating fertilizer, sun-drying seeds, cultivating land, and preserving soil moisture. Some areas in Shanxi, Hebei, Hubei and other provinces also have some activities in summarizing and disseminating wheat high-yield experience, but they have not been carried out universally.

### 半月农情　立秋（8月8日）——处暑（8月23日）

　　半月农情
　　立秋（8月8日）——处暑（8月23日）
    虽然北方有“立了秋，挂锄钩”的农谚，但是今年这里的农民并没有因为立了秋而减少农事活动。山西、陕西、河南、山东等省的农民在8月上旬以后，一直紧张地向干旱作斗争。一些地区的农民在抗旱保秋方面已经收到一定的效果，浇灌了大量受旱的秋田，并在抗旱中新修了许多小型的水利工程。东北地区的农民在这个阶段正忙于“放秋垅，拿大草”；辽宁的农民，除了上面说的促使作物早熟的田间管理以外，还进行了扑灭高粱蚜虫的艰巨工作，抢救一百多万公顷高粱。
                    ※
    “立秋”后“处暑”前正是北方地区春播玉米、高粱、谷子等作物成熟的时期。内蒙古等地的胡麻也在这个时候收获。今年这些地区的春播杂粮作物一般生长得不错。根据河南确山、上蔡、平舆、遂平、汝南五县初步估算，高粱每亩平均能产一百八十斤，谷子能产三百斤左右，玉米产量可能在四百斤以上。
    北方地区夏播玉米、谷子多数生长正常，部分受到干旱威胁。生长正常的夏播玉米、谷子在8月中旬开始抽穗。安徽等省的灾后庄稼也生长得很好。
                      ※
    南方各省的两亿亩左右中稻已在这个时期收获完毕。部分地区的中稻因旱产量略低，年景正常的中稻都比去年增产。湖北荆州专区的七百二十一万亩中稻普遍丰收。这个专区的荆江分洪区的三十一万亩中稻平均亩产五百四十斤，比去年增产30％以上。
    南方地区的一季晚稻8月15日前后开始抽穗，双季晚稻一般的已经中耕头遍。从一些地区的农作物病虫预测预报的情况看，今年为害晚稻的三化螟比较严重。四川一些地区今年发生的螟蛾比去年多十倍以上。
                    ※
    大规模的秋收在“白露”以后就要陆续开始了。不少地区要在秋收以后紧接着秋种。准备秋收秋种的活动，许多地区早在“立秋”以后就已经着手，一般比去年略早。
    许多地区为了争取明年小麦丰收，进行了积肥、晒种、耕地、保墒等工作。山西、河北、湖北等省的一些地区，在总结和传播小麦丰产经验上也有一些活动，但是并没有普遍进行。
