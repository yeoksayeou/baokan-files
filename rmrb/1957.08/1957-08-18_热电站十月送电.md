    Power Station to Supply Electricity in October
    The installation work of the Luoyang Thermal Power Plant has been more than half completed, and electricity will be supplied to the three major factories in Luoyang in October this year.

    Most of the heating pipes for Boiler No. 1 have been completed, and only the pipe interfaces are being welded. On Boiler No. 1, which is twenty-nine meters high, twenty-four electric welding sparks flicker from time to time. Twenty-four carefully selected high-pressure welders are welding the heating pipes there. A hydrostatic test will be carried out in mid-August to check whether the installed pipes are qualified. The installation of steam engines and turbines is also in full swing.

    热电站十月送电
    洛阳热电厂安装工程已经完成一半以上，今年10月份就要向洛阳三大工厂送电。
    一号锅炉的受热管道已经大部完工，只剩下管道接口正在焊接。在高达二十九公尺的一号锅炉上，时时闪烁着二十四朵电焊火花。二十四个经过严格挑选的高压焊工，正在那里焊接受热管道。8月中旬将进行水压试验，以检查安装起来的各种管道是否合格。蒸汽机和汽轮机的安装工程也正在紧张进行。
