Ding Ling's poisonous influence on young people included the so-called "one-bookism," meaning that the country, the Party, and comrades are all unreliable and unnecessary to rely on. As long as you write a book, like the one she wrote, "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," then everything will be fine, you will quickly rise to prominence, and you will have everything.

I call it poisonous because it did indeed have a poisonous effect. Some young people aspiring to literature did not consider the purpose of literature, let alone that the literary cause is a part of the Party's cause, nor did they consider the educational role of literature on the people and its impact on society. They only thought about how much money I could get for this article—this book—after it came out, so I could buy a house and be independent. In a word, I would not have to rely on anyone. Even the Party that nurtured and raised me could be put behind me, or even thrown to the winds.

Therefore, they do not first consider that they are Party members, cadres, or soldiers, but boast that they are social people, some even saying that they are people with status in society. I remember at a symposium, a painter said this:

	"I am a Communist Party member, I am a painter, a member of the Artists Association, but I am also a social person, a person with status in society. Therefore, I am speaking today as a social person." How thought-provoking! It seems that a social person, a person with status in society, is far more noble than a Communist Party member, and the glorious title of Communist Party member is not as good as being a social person.

Why is this so? He feels that being a Communist Party member is nothing special; moreover, he has to be subject to certain organizational constraints, attend certain meetings, and criticize himself at the meetings, which is not very free! Becoming a social person can be free.

In fact, before he became famous, that is, before he had painted a picture, before the painting had been published, before the book had been written, before it had been published, and before the leadership had valued him, at this time, he felt that the Party was good and worth relying on, and would also say, "The Party is my life." Once his painting was published, the book was published, and many copies were printed, and some young people asked him to give reports and lectures, or elected him as this member or that representative, he became excited and dizzy and did not know why. It seemed that all these achievements were due to his own "personal struggle." It was completely a mood of "forgetting the mother after being weaned."

Therefore, it is not okay to offer opinions on his work! Modification is even more "crude"; saying that the performance should be revised to be more mature is administrative interference, not understanding how to lead literature and art according to the characteristics of literature and art. In short, the work is mine, it is the result of my labor, it cannot be touched, it cannot be moved, it can only be appreciated, unconditionally praised.

Not only that, but they are also full of arrogance, do not read documents, hate meetings, and even say that the Party and Youth League group meetings are a burden, and are extremely unwilling to be included in the Party's supervision. It is best to be outside the Party, above the Party, but the glorious title of Party member must be retained, and over time, they become "uncivilized people."

Is it really Tao Yuanming's Shangri-La? But it is not. They also want status, they also want treatment, especially they want people to respect them everywhere. They do not compare contributions, but compare enjoyment; their relationship with the organization is a business relationship, I wrote a book, I am a writer, you have to give me everything.

Isn't this thoroughly corrupt bourgeois stuff? Ding Ling herself is like this, and she wants others to be like this too, as if everyone is like this, then whether or not to be a Communist Party member does not matter.

These people have forgotten that they are only recording fragments of the struggles of thousands of people. Without the struggles of thousands of people, where would the writers' works come from? And this is especially true for those young writers who have just risen. Let us think about what our situation was when we joined the embrace of the revolution and joined the revolutionary army. I often use a very simple analogy, saying that we ourselves have gone from a small bundle (guerrilla warfare period) to a "madazi" (horse blanket for loading things) to a small box to having our own home. What a great distance this is, illustrating the progress of the revolution and the improvement of our personal lives. Haven't the people and the Party paid us enough? How many significant contributions have we made to the people and the Party?

I once thought that many people used to not be able to afford shoes and were not able to eat their fill. Today, in the new society, there has been a revolution, and the Communist Party has given them everything—reputation, status, and living security—but he still says that the Communist Party is not good. At first, it seems like it is about a specific person, referring to a specific thing, but gradually it becomes about many people, many things, and ultimately it comes down to the Party cannot do this, cannot do that. The implication or the opposite meaning is that he can do this, he can do that.

Isn't this instant fame under the influence of Ding Ling's "one-bookism" a very dangerous thing? "The higher their reputation, the greater the distance from the Party," isn't this a profound portrayal of those who become famous overnight and think they are extraordinary?

Currently, what lies before them is:

	Haggling over how much income, for the sake of income, they can publish this opinion in this publication, and at the same time publish a different opinion from this in that publication, but in reality, they are all about one thing, one work. They write a script, then turn it into a novel, and also publish a comic book, all for the sake of making more money. It is not an exaggeration to call such people "clowns" and "money grubbers."

Then there is—what I think is the most dangerous—serious detachment from life. They are unwilling to go to difficult places, and when they want to go, they first ask how to get there, whether to take a soft-seat train or a plane? Where to stay when they arrive? I ask, how can they write works worthy of the great era in this way!

I say this is the most dangerous because from then on he cannot see new things in life, nor can he be spurred on by life, let alone be supervised by the people who create life. How many people have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's "dismount and see the flowers"?

The above is by no means the entirety of our literary life, but even if it is just a little bit, it is worth our attention, because it has opened up loopholes for the Rightists, and some people have fallen into becoming Rightists because of this. I absolutely do not oppose them becoming famous, and I have no jealousy of their fame, but I truly feel that they should be brought into the organization, cultivate their Party spirit a little, be closer to the people, and make them—these people who have become famous overnight—know how they became famous. Otherwise, their fame will also collapse. The ultimate goal of the anti-Rightist struggle is still to consolidate ourselves and build our proletarian literary army.

This is the purpose of my short article.

### 一举成名了不得

　　一举成名了不得
　　冬今
    丁玲毒害青年的东西之中有所谓“一本书主义”，意思就是什么国家，什么党，什么同志，都是靠不住的，也用不着靠，只要写一本书，写成了，像她写的“太阳照在桑乾河上”，就好了，就可飞黄腾达了，就有了一切了。
    我所以称之为毒害，就是它确确实实发生过毒害的作用。一些有志于文学的青年，没有考虑到文学的目的性是什么，更没有考虑到文学事业是党的事业的一个部分，也没有考虑到文学对人民的教育作用和对社会的影响，一心想到我这篇文章——这本书出来后拿多少钱，我可以买房子，我可以自立了。一句话，我就可以不依靠谁了。就是抚育培养我成长的党，也可以搁在脑后，甚或抛在九霄云外。
    因而就不首先考虑自己是党员，是干部，是军人，而夸耀我是社会人，有的甚至说我是社会上有地位的人。记得在一次座谈会上，一位画家就这样说过：
      “我是共产党员，我是画家，美协会员，但我也是社会人，社会上有地位的人，因此，我今天是以社会人的地位发言”。多么耐人寻味！好像社会人，社会上有地位的人远比共产党员高尚，而共产党员这个光荣的称号到反不如一个社会人。
    为什么会这样呢？他觉得当一个共产党员有什么了不得；何况还要受一定的组织约束，参加一定的会、会上还要批评自我批评，多不自由呀！成了社会人就可以自由了。
    其实在他还没有名之前，就是他还没有画成画、画还没有发表，书还没有写成，还没有出版，领导上还没有器重他，在这时候，他觉得党是好的，是值得依靠的，也会说“党是我的生命”。一旦他画发表了，书出版了，印的份数还不少，青年中也有人请他去作报告，讲演，或者选了他这个委员，那个代表，他就由兴奋而晕乎而不知其所以了。俨然这一切成就都是因为他自己的“个人奋斗”而得来的。完全是一种“断了奶忘了娘”的情绪。
    因之，要对他的东西提点意见，不行！修改，就更是“粗暴”；说修改得成熟一点再公演，就是行政干涉，不懂得按照文艺特性领导文艺。总之，作品是我的，是我劳动的成果，摸不得，动不得，只能欣赏，无原则的捧场。
    不仅如此，他们也就骄气十足，文件不看，讨厌开会，连党、团的小组会也说成是负担，极不愿意把自己纳在党的监督之内，最好是在党之外，党之上，而党员的光荣称号则又非要不可，久而久之，就成为“化外人”了。
    是不是真是陶渊明的世外桃源，却又不是。又还要地位，还要待遇，特别是还要人到处尊敬。不比贡献，而比享受；同组织是一种买卖关系，我写了书，我是作家，你就得给我一切。
    难道这不是腐朽透了的资产阶级的东西吗？丁玲自己这样，还要人家也跟她这样，仿佛都这样了，当不当共产党员也就没有什么了。
    这些人忘了自己只不过是记录了千千万万人民斗争中的点滴，没有千千万万人民的斗争，哪有作家的作品呢？而这特别是对那些刚起来的青年作家们。让我们想一想，我们投到革命怀抱，参加革命军队，那时我们是一种什么情况，我常常打一个很浅近的比方，说我们自己是由一个小包袱皮（游击战争时期）到马达子（装东西的马褥套）到小箱子到了有自己的家，这中间是多么一个大的距离，说明革命的进展，说明我们个人生活的提高，难道人民和党付给我们的还少吗？我们又替人民和党作了多少了不得的贡献？
    我曾经想，好些人过去常年穿不上鞋，吃不饱饭，今天新社会，革命了，共产党给了他一切——名誉地位，生活保障，但他还是说共产党不好，开始好像说是某一个具体人，指某一件具体事，逐渐的就是好些个人了，好些件事了，而最终就归结到党不能这样，不能那样，言外之意或反面之意就是他这也能，那也能。
    这种在丁玲“一本书主义”影响之下的一举成名难道不是很危险的事吗？“他们的名望愈高，同党的距离就愈大”，这不正是那些一举成名就了不得的人的深刻写照吗？
    目前摆在他们面前的是：
    斤斤计较收入多少，为了收入，可以在这个刊物发表这种意见，同时又可在那种刊物上发表与这个不同的意见，而实际都是对一件事，一个作品。写了剧本，又改成了小说，还出小人书，无非都是可多拿钱。这种人称为“小丑”“财迷”并不为过。
    再就是——我以为是最危险的就是严重的脱离生活，艰苦之处不愿去，要去时先问是怎么去，坐软席还是坐飞机？到了住什么地方？试问，这样怎能写出无愧于伟大时代的作品！
    我说这是最危险就是他从此看不到生活中的新鲜东西，也受不到生活的鞭策，更受不到创造生活的人们的监督。有几个人认真的执行了毛主席的“下马看花”呢？
    以上这些，决不是我们文学生活中的全体，但那怕就是一点，也是值得我们注意的，因为它给右派闪出了空子，有的人就因此而坠落成了右派。我绝不反对他们成名，更丝毫没有嫉妒他们成名之意，但我确确实实觉得应该把他们纳入组织，锻炼他们一点党性，和人民更近一点，使他们——这些一举成名的人知道他是如何成名的。不然的话，名也会垮掉的。反右派斗争最后的目的还是要巩固我们自己，建设我们无产阶级的文艺大军。
    这就是我这篇短文的目的。
