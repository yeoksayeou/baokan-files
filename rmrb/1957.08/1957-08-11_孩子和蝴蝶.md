    Child and Butterfly
    Yu Weiye
    On the grass. A yellow butterfly flew from a distance, and my wife shouted, "Jia'er, look at the butterfly!" Jia'er's red hat turned around, but he couldn't find the butterfly, but the butterfly suddenly swooped towards Jia'er's head, and then quickly flew away.
    I couldn't help but exclaim, "The butterfly is mistaken, it mistook Jia'er for a flower." But I immediately realized my imprudence, and from my wife's reproachful look, I understood:
    "The butterfly is not mistaken, our child is originally the most beautiful flower."

    孩子和蝴蝶

    草地上。远处一只黄色的蝴蝶飞来，妻喊道：“嘉儿，快看蝴蝶！”嘉儿的红帽转来转去，他却没有找到蝴蝶，可是蝴蝶却猛地向嘉儿头上扑去，一下又很快飞开。
    我不禁叫道：“蝴蝶错了，它把嘉儿当作了一朵花。”但我立刻就发现了自己的冒失，从妻底责怪的眼色中我领会到了：
    “蝴蝶没有错，我们的孩子本来就是一朵最美的花。”
