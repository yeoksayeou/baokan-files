What the Audience Doesn't Know...
	Guo An
	The Egyptian basketball team is the strongest in the Arab countries. The team visiting our country this time is mainly composed of champions from the Cairo university basketball league - nine students from the Engineering Department of Cairo University, and five bank clerks, officers and students from other universities, all under the age of twenty-five. The strongest center of the Egyptian team, number ten, Shami, is an army engineer officer, 1.95 meters tall and weighing 96 kilograms. In the recent match against the Chinese youth basketball team at the festival, he scored 22 points alone.

	The Egyptian basketball team attached great importance to their first game after arriving in our country. After three consecutive days of flying, the players ignored their fatigue and practiced shooting, free throws, and tactical coordination for two hours on the morning of their second day in Beijing. In the evening, they practiced in the gymnasium for another two hours to familiarize themselves with the venue, lighting, and equipment.

	Mr. Asar, the leader of the Egyptian team, is the Secretary-General of the Egyptian Basketball Association, and he has been an international referee since 1947. He introduced the Egyptian team's performance at the festival to reporters. He said that the Egyptian team achieved ninth place in the entire league. In the first round of the competition, they won against Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Tunisia, and lost to Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, taking third place. The most regrettable thing was the match against Czechoslovakia, when five main players were sick, but the game was lost by only six points in the end; otherwise, it would have been entirely possible to obtain the qualification for the top six finals. When talking about the China-Egypt game at the festival, Asar said: The Chinese team's players are in good physical condition, fast, and have excellent tactics and personal skills. The Egyptian team, with the exception of individual players, is generally weaker in these aspects.

    埃及篮球队在阿拉伯国家中是最强的。这次来我国访问的篮球队主要是由开罗各大学篮球联赛的冠军组成——开罗大学工程系学生九人，银行职员、军官和其它大学的学生五人，每人年龄都在二十五岁以下。埃及队最强的中锋十号沙米是陆军工兵军官，身高一公尺九十五公分，体重九十六公斤。最近在联欢节上对我国青年篮球队的比赛中，他一人独得了二十二分。

    埃及篮球队对来我国后的第一场比赛非常重视。队员在连续三天的飞行之后，到北京的第二天早上便不顾疲惫，作了两小时的投篮、罚球和战术配合的练习，晚上，他们又在体育馆内练习了两小时。为的是熟悉场地，灯光和设备。

    埃及队领队阿萨尔先生是埃及篮球联合会秘书长，他在1947年便是国际裁判。他向记者介绍了埃及队在联欢节上的比赛情况。他说，埃及队在整个联赛中取得了第九名。在第一轮比赛中胜了比利时、英国、突尼斯，输给保加利亚和捷克，取得了第三名。最遗憾的是对捷克的一场比赛，当时有五个主力队员病了，可是比赛最后仅输六分，要不然，完全有可能取得前六名的决赛权。阿萨尔在谈到联欢节上的中、埃一场比赛时说：中国队的队员体质好，速度快，战术和个人技术都很好。埃及队除个别队员外，一般队员在这方面都差一些。
