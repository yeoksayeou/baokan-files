    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st. The most captivating performance of the fourth day of the festival (July 31st) was the international street acrobatics show. That afternoon, hundreds of thousands of Muscovites gathered at the Garden Ring Road and Gorky Street to watch this magnificent acrobatic procession.

    Acrobats from the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Romania, Mongolia, and other countries participated in the performance. Cars, adorned in vibrant colors, passed by one after another. The performances included circus acts, acrobatics, martial arts, contortion, vehicle stunts, and slapstick comedy. Some in the parade rode unicycles, while others walked while doing somersaults. Elephants with long trunks, camels striding confidently, giraffes, and black bears all participated in the parade. Soviet tiger tamer Nazarova also came with her tigers. A group of steeds advanced, dancing the foxtrot. During this approximately two-hour parade, the Chinese youth acrobats' performances of plate spinning, human pyramids, jar-balancing, and bicycle stunts were warmly welcomed by the audience on both sides of the street. After the parade reached its endpoint at the "Dynamo" stadium, there was also an hour-long performance.

    On this day, art troupes from many countries began their performances. The British "Workshop" theater troupe's first performance was Shakespeare's famous tragedy "Macbeth." Edwards, who played Macbeth, vividly shaped the character's image and received high praise.

    In a meeting of vocational youths, railway workers from twenty-eight countries held a grand meeting at the Central Cultural Palace for Railway Employees. Those responsible for children's organizations among the festival delegates discussed the topic of "The Role of Games and Labor in Cultivating and Developing Children's Creativity" at the Young Pioneers Palace. Chemistry students held a meeting at Moscow University to exchange their learning experiences. Young miners also held a meeting.

    街头杂技表演引人入胜
    各业青年会见交流经验
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　联欢节第四天（7月31日）最引人入胜的表演是街头国际杂技表演。这天下午，几十万莫斯科人聚集到花园环道和高尔基大街观赏了这支壮丽的杂技行列。
    苏、中、波、罗、蒙等国的杂技演员参加了演出。汽车打扮得五光十色，一辆接一辆开了过来。这里演出的有马戏、杂技、武术、柔术、车技、滑稽剧等。游行队伍中有的人乘坐独轮自行车，有的人一面走一面翻跟斗。?着长鼻子的大象、高视阔步的骆驼、长颈鹿和大黑熊都参加了游行。苏联驯虎女郎纳扎洛娃也带着她的老虎来了。一群骏马在跳着狐步舞前进。在这约两小时的游行中，中国青年杂技演员表演的耍盘子、叠罗汉、顶坛和自行车术受到街道两旁观众的热烈欢迎。游行队达到终点“狄纳莫”运动场后，还进行了约一小时表演。
    这一天，许多国家的艺术团体开始了自己的演出。英国“车间”剧团第一次演出的是莎士比亚著名悲剧“马克白斯”。扮演马克白斯的爱德华兹生动地塑造出这个人物的形象，获得很高的评价。
    在职业青年会见中，二十八国的青年铁路职工在铁路员工中央文化宫举行了盛大会见。联欢节代表中的儿童组织负责人们在少先宫讨论了“游戏和劳动在培养和发展儿童创造力中的作用”的问题。学化学的学生在莫斯科大学举行了会见，交流他们的学习经验。青年矿工们也举行了会见。
