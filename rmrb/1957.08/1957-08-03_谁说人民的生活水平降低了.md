Who Says People's Living Standards Have Declined?
Zhou Jingyu
Our workers and peasants often like to use methods of recalling the past, settling accounts, and making comparisons to spur themselves to clarify the direction of progress. Everyone has calculated their own accounts, and each calculation increases their political enthusiasm. Their confidence and determination to build socialism also becomes stronger each time.

Rightists say that unified purchase and sales have messed things up, that people's living standards have declined since liberation, etc., as if everything was pitch black after liberation. Comparing the present with the past, comparing before liberation with after liberation, have people's living standards improved or declined? I think facts should speak for themselves.

First, let's look at the lives of workers
In 1929-1930, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs conducted a survey of 305 worker households. The material recorded that: these workers "rely solely on wages to maintain their lives, and eight or nine out of ten families are in short supply; even if they use the entire family income to maintain their lives, two-thirds of the families cannot make ends meet"; "22.2% of their income is borrowed at high interest rates", "88.2% of households borrow money, and 78% pawn items"; at that time, "the monthly interest rate of pawnshops was mostly around 2%, and the monthly interest rate of usurious loans was mostly above 10%", and workers mostly borrowed "usurious loans". The survey material also gave such an example: a worker's family of four, with three people participating in labor, had a monthly income of more than 40 yuan, but due to debts incurred by his father's death, he needed to pay more than 30 yuan in interest each month. Such income was "only enough to repay debts, let alone living"! Therefore, this official survey report had to admit that the lives of workers at that time were "suffering from exploitation and trapped in an inextricable situation."

Shanghai was a city with concentrated industry and relatively developed worker movements. At that time, the living standards of Shanghai workers were much higher than those of workers in other parts of the country. Since the lives of Shanghai workers were "trapped in an inextricable situation," it is not difficult to imagine the extent of the suffering of workers' lives in other places.

What is the situation now? Premier Zhou Enlai said: "In the seven years, we have solved the employment problem for about 13 million people, which has never happened in the history of old China. The average wage of workers across the country in 1952 was 446 yuan per person, and it increased to 610 yuan in 1956, an increase of nearly 37% in four years. Such a wage growth rate has also never happened in the history of old China." Of course, the improvements in the lives of Chinese workers are not limited to these. For example, from 1952 to 1956, our country built more than 70 million square meters of housing for workers; from January to June 1956, 1,678 factories and mines across the country implemented the method of self-built public-assisted housing, and more than 60,200 people built their own houses. Since 1951, the state has promulgated labor insurance regulations, stipulating that labor insurance should be implemented in railways, shipping, postal and telecommunications, and factories and mines with more than 100 people nationwide. In 1951, 2.6 million workers enjoyed labor insurance, which increased to 7.41 million in 1956. The cultural level of workers has also improved significantly. Currently, more than 2 million workers have been freed from illiteracy.

We can also make a comparison from the physical consumption of workers. According to the "Living Standards of Shanghai Workers" published by the Shanghai Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs in 1934, and according to the recent survey of 5,793 worker households in 27 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an by the National Bureau of Statistics, the physical consumption of workers is as follows:

	Unit		1929 to 1930 (Shanghai)	1956 in 27 Large and Medium Cities	1956 as % of 1934
	Grain (jin)	272.6		331.89		121.7
	Pork (jin)	8		11.53		144.1
	Fresh Vegetables (jin)	Missing		218.76		——
	Cotton Cloth (chi)	16.38		35.06		215.3

The above table shows that Chinese workers lived a life of not having enough to eat or wear under the rule of the Kuomintang, while after liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, workers can not only eat and dress warmly, but also have more non-staple food than in the past.

A first-class driver of the Beijing Tram Company started working as a pointsman at the company in 1924. Later, he became a driver, and his monthly salary was not even enough to buy corn buns. Now, his family of three has a monthly income of 60 to 70 yuan. They often eat rice and white flour, have vegetables at every meal, can eat meat once a week, smoke half a pack of Hengda cigarettes every day, wear western-style clothes in all seasons, and have cotton-padded coats and leather shoes in winter. The family also has a bicycle, a sewing machine, a radio, a watch, and a clock.

There are many, many similar examples.

Let's look at the lives of farmers
During the Kuomintang rule, more than 90% of farmers owned only 20%-30% of the land, while 70%-80% of the land was concentrated in the hands of landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for only 7% of rural households and 10% of the population. Those landless and land-poor peasants rented land from landlords and rich peasants. In addition to paying 60 billion jin of rent grain every year, there were other various forms of extra-economic exploitation. At that time, the grain plundered from poor and hired peasants by landlords, moneylenders, and reactionary regimes accounted for about 70% of their net income. According to the survey materials of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 1936, the average annual consumption of landlords and rich peasants was 327.6 yuan per person, while the annual consumption of a working peasant family of five was only 61.2 yuan. The disparity between rich and poor was very obvious.

What is the situation of farmers' lives after liberation? As everyone knows, due to the victory of the land reform, 300 million landless and land-poor farmers obtained 700 million mu of land and were freed from the heavy burden of paying 60 billion jin of rent grain to landlords every year. From 1950 to 1956, the state allocated more than 5 billion yuan for water conservancy construction, disaster relief and relief funds, and the promotion of new agricultural implements and the improvement of production technology. A total of 8 billion yuan in agricultural loans was issued in seven years, creating favorable conditions for farmers to develop production. Premier Zhou Enlai said: "The total value of agricultural production in our country is increasing year by year. The total value of agricultural production in the country in 1949 was 32.6 billion yuan, and it rose to 58.3 billion yuan in 1956, an increase of 79% compared with 1949. With the increase in the total value of agricultural output, the purchasing power of farmers has also greatly increased. The purchasing power of farmers across the country in 1950 was 8.1 billion yuan, and it rose to 19.1 billion yuan in 1956, an increase of 136% compared with 1950. … The increase in production and consumption among more than 500 million farmers is something that has never happened in old China."

The following is the increase in the average physical consumption of farmers in recent years:

Average annual physical consumption per person	Unit	1949	1956	1956 as % of 1949
Grain			jin	276	425	153.98
Vegetable Oil		jin	1.7	3.8	223.53
Pork			jin	6.9	7.7	111.59
Edible Salt		jin	8	11	137.5
Sugar and Sugar Vegetables jin	2.6	7.7	296
Cotton Cloth and Cloth Products (including native cloth) chi	6.9	20	289.8

It should be explained that the 1949 figures are calculated on the average, including landlords and rich peasants. If only the consumption of ordinary farmers is calculated, it will be even lower. In short, the physical consumption of farmers in our country has undergone great changes in just seven years. This change powerfully proves that the lives of farmers have not declined but have improved significantly.

Of course, the improvement of farmers' lives is also uneven, and there are still some gaps in the living standards between farmers. According to the recent survey data analysis of the Hunan Provincial Bureau of Statistics, in Hunan's rural areas in 1936, the year with the highest income and living standards before the war, the average income per family member of farmers was 69.71 yuan (referring to the total income minus expenditures such as production materials and taxes, calculated at constant prices). In 1956, under severe disaster conditions in Hunan, the net income of each farm household still reached 83.2 yuan, and the physical consumption per person per year (including grain, edible oil, meat, cotton cloth, etc.) increased compared with the highest pre-war level. Since the land reform, the lives of 80% of the poor and hired peasants in Hunan have risen to the level of middle peasants. Due to natural disasters and overpopulation, the lives of 13.2% of households in rural areas are still relatively difficult. Their average annual consumption per person is: 468 jin of grain, 2.15 jin of edible oil, 5.5 jin of meat... This shows that their lives are not considered extremely hard.

The cry of certain rightists that the lives of farmers have declined compared with the past is nothing more than reflecting the opinions of a few landlord exploiters. Because the lives of the people who have truly declined compared with the past in rural areas are not the vast majority of farmers, but a small handful of landlords and usurers. They used to live by exploitation. Once they are required to engage in labor and their lives are somewhat lower than in the past, isn't that completely appropriate?

What is the difference between workers and peasants?
In the face of a large number of facts, some people have to admit that the lives of farmers have indeed improved compared with the past, but they say that the lives of farmers have improved too slowly compared with workers, and that the living standards between workers and peasants are too far apart.

What is the actual situation? According to the surveys of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Bureau of Statistics, the growth of the average actual consumption of Chinese workers and Chinese farmers is as follows:

Before the Anti-Japanese War	1936	One Year Before the Five-Year Plan	1952	1956	1956 as % of 1936
Workers		130	167.7		199.8	153.7
Farmers		61.2	72.8		84.2	137.6

It can be seen from the above table that the physical consumption of workers in 1956 increased by half compared with 1936, and the physical consumption of farmers also increased by one-third. From 1952 to 1956, the consumption of workers increased by an average of 4.5% per year, and the consumption of farmers increased by an average of 3.7% per year. The consumption ratio of workers and farmers was 2.30 to 1 in 1952, and it narrowed to 2.18 to 1 in 1956. In 1955, workers increased their wages more, but in that year, natural disasters occurred in agriculture, which led to a slight expansion in the consumption level of workers and farmers. However, if factors such as the difference in prices between urban and rural areas are deducted, the ratio of consumption levels between workers and farmers was 1.83 to 1 in 1952, 1.78 to 1 in 1955, and 1.95 to 1 in 1956. It should be explained that the above consumption ratio of workers includes a part of senior intellectuals, which expands the consumption level of workers and farmers to a certain extent. If this part of the factor is deducted, the difference between workers and peasants is not very large.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: In 1956, the average annual wage of workers was 610 yuan, which was more than twice as high as the total family income of farmers. If only the monetary figures of income are compared, it seems that the lives of workers and peasants are indeed very different. However, if the different living conditions in urban and rural areas are estimated, the situation is different. In rural areas, maintaining a life with enough to eat and wear only requires an average monthly expenditure of 5 yuan per person from a national perspective, while maintaining the same living standard in cities requires 10 yuan. Therefore, we believe that although there are differences in the living standards of workers and peasants, they are not excessively disparate, and the labor productivity of workers is much higher than that of farmers. Therefore, it is also appropriate to maintain a reasonable difference between workers and peasants.

With the increase in the income of workers and peasants and the improvement of material life, the cultural life of workers and peasants has also improved significantly. For example, the number of students from worker and peasant families in universities and secondary schools has increased greatly:

					1952	1956	1956 as % of 1952
University Students (10,000s)	19.4	40.8	210.3
Of which from Worker and Peasant Families (10,000s)	4.0	13.9	347.5
Proportion of Students from Worker and Peasant Families (%)	20.5	34.1	——
Secondary School Students (10,000s)	315	601	191.0
Of which from Worker and Peasant Families (10,000s)	178	396	222.5
Proportion of Students from Worker and Peasant Families (%)	56.6	65.9	——

The students from worker and peasant families mentioned in the above table refer to the children of manual laborers, workers and peasants, and do not include the children of general staff members.

It can be clearly seen from the figures in the above table that the number of worker and peasant children entering universities has increased by nearly two and a half times in the past four years; the number entering secondary schools has increased by more than one time. In 1956, worker and peasant children in universities exceeded one-third, and secondary schools have reached two-thirds. This is also something that has never happened in Chinese history.

All the above facts show that the living standards of workers and peasants in our country have greatly improved since liberation. Of course, this living standard is still very low compared with industrialized countries, but it has never happened in the historical situation of China; the so-called prosperous times in Chinese history (such as the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty and the Qianlong and Jiaqing era of the Qing Dynasty) were all achieved within 100 years after the founding of the country, while the new China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has seen a truly prosperous age in just seven years. If it were not for the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the superior social system, how could we imagine achieving such great achievements? We know that the improvement of people's lives is determined by the level of development of the productive forces. At present, the development of industry and agriculture in our country is very fast, but there are still many difficulties in the process of socialist industrialization. It requires the people of the whole country to work hard, be diligent and thrifty to accumulate construction funds, and develop social productive forces. Only with the continuous improvement of social productive forces can the living standards of the working people in our country be further improved.

    谁说人民的生活水平降低了
    周静宇
    我国的工人和农民经常喜欢用回忆、算账和对比的办法来鞭策自己明确前进方向。每个人都替自己算过账，每算一次，他们的政治积极性就提高一次。他们的建设社会主义的信心和决心也一次比一次坚强。
    右派分子说什么统购统销搞糟了，说什么解放后人民的生活水平降低了，等等，好像解放以后到处都是漆黑一团。现在同过去比较，解放以前同解放以后比较，人民生活水平究竟是改善了还是下降了？我想，还是让事实说话吧。
    先看工人的生活
    1929—1930年国民党上海市政府社会局曾对三百零五户的工人家庭进行过一次调查。这份材料记载着：这些工人“仅仅以工资来维持生活，十家中短亏的有八、九家之多；若以全家收入来维持生活，也有三分之二的家庭入不敷出”；“收入中有22.2％是出重利借来的”，“借债的户数占88.2％，当物的户数占78％”；当时“押店和当铺的月息多在二分左右，印子钱的月息大半在十分以上”，而工人举债，多数是“印子钱”。这份调查材料还举了这样一个例子：有个工人全家四口，有三个人参加劳动，每月收入四十余元，但因丧父负债，每月需要付出利息三十余元。这样的收入，“仅供还债，遑云生活”！因此，这个官方调查报告也不得不承认当时的工人生活“备受剥削之苦、陷于不拔之境。”
    上海是工业集中，工人运动比较发展的城市，当时，上海工人的生活水平比全国其他地方的工人要高得多。既然上海的工人生活“陷于不拔之境”，其他地方的工人生活痛苦到什么程度，那就不难想像了。
    现在的情况怎样呢？周恩来总理说：“在七年中间，我们解决了约一千三百万人的就业问题，这是旧中国历史上从来没有过的。1952年全国职工平均工资是每人四百四十六元，1956年提高到六百一十元，在四年中间，提高了将近37％。这样的工资增长速度，也是旧中国历史上从来没有过的。”中国工人生活改善的方面当然还不止这些。譬如从1952到1956年，我们的国家为职工修建的住宅达七千多万平方公尺；1956年1月至6月，全国有一千六百七十八个厂矿推行了自建公助住宅的办法，有六万零二百多人建筑了自己的住宅。从1951年起国家颁布了劳动保险条例，规定在全国范围内的铁路、航运、邮电和百人以上的厂矿企业中实行劳动保险。1951年享受劳动保险的职工为二百六十万人，到1956年已增加到七百四十一万人。职工的文化水平也有了显著的提高，目前已有二百多万职工摆脱了文盲状态。
    我们还可以从职工的实物消费量做个比较。根据1934年国民党上海市政府社会局出版的“上海市工人生活程度”一书中列举的工人实物消费情况，再根据国家统计局最近对北京、上海、天津、沈阳、广州、武汉、重庆、西安等二十七个城市五千七百九十三户职工家庭的调查，工人实物消费的情况如下：
    单位　1929到1930年（上海）  1956年27个大中城市  1956为1934年的％
    粮食（斤）　　272.6　　331.89　　121.7
    猪肉（斤）　　8　　11.53　　144.1
    鲜菜（斤）　　缺　　218.76　　——
    棉布（尺）　　16.38　　35.06　　215.3
    上表说明：我国工人在国民党统治时代是过着吃不饱、穿不暖的生活，而在解放以后，在中国共产党领导下，工人们不仅能吃饱穿暖，而且副食品也比过去增加很多。
    北京电车公司一级司机在1924年就到这个公司做搬道工作，后来当上司机，每月所得工资连窝头也吃不饱。现在，他一家三口，每月收入六、七十元，家里经常吃的是大米、白面，每顿有菜，每星期能吃一顿肉，每天还抽半包恒大香烟，四季都穿洋布衣服，冬天还有棉大衣、皮鞋，家里还有自行车一辆，缝纫机一架，收音机一架，手表、座钟各一个。
    类似这样的例子很多很多。
    再看农民的生活
    在国民党统治时代，90％以上的农民只占有20％—30％的土地，而70％到80％的土地则集中在只占农村户数7％、人口10％的地主富农手里，那些无地少地的农民租种了地主富农的土地，每年除了交纳地租粮六百亿斤以外，还有其他的各种超经济剥削。当时，贫雇农每年被地主、高利贷者以及反动政权所掠取的粮食占到他们自己净收入的70％左右。据中国科学院经济研究所的调查材料，1936年地主富农每年每人的平均消费额为三百二十七元六角，而五口之家的劳动农民全家全年消费额只有六十一元二角。贫富悬殊，十分明显。
    解放以后农民生活情况怎样呢？大家知道：由于土地改革的胜利，三亿无地少地的农民获得了七亿亩土地，免除了每年向地主交纳六百亿斤地租的沉重负担。从1950年到1956年的七年当中，国家共拨款五十多亿元用于水利建设、救灾救济经费和推广新式农具、提高生产技术等方面，七年中共发放农贷八十亿元，替农民创造了发展生产的有利条件。周恩来总理说：“我国农业生产总值是逐年上升的。1949年全国农业生产总值是三百二十六亿元，1956年上升到五百八十三亿元。比1949年增长了百分之七十九。随着农业总产值的增长，农民的购买力也大大提高了。1950年全国农民的购买力是八十一亿元，1956年上升到一百九十一亿元，比1950年增长了百分之一百三十六。……在五万万多的农民中，生产和消费的增长这样大，是旧中国从来没有过的。”
    下面是几年来农民平均实物消费量的增长情况：
    每人每年平均实物消费量  单位　1949年　1956年　1956为1949年的％
    粮食　  　斤　276　　425　　153.98
    植物油　　斤　1.7　　3.8　　223.53
    猪肉　  　斤　6.9　　7.7　　111.59
    食盐  　　斤　8　　11　　137.5
    食糖和糖菜　斤　2.6　　7.7　　296
    棉布和布制品（包括土布）尺　6.9　　20　　289.8
    应该说明：1949年的数字是包括地主富农在内平均计算的，如果只算一般农民的消费，则还要低些。总之，我国农民在短短七年当中每人每年的实物消费量有了很大的变化，这个变化有力地证明农民的生活不是下降而是显著地改善了。
    当然，农民生活改善的情况也是不平衡的，农民之间的生活水平还有一些差距。据湖南省统计局最近调查资料分析，湖南农村在战前收入和生活水平最高的1936年，农民每一家庭成员平均收入是六十九点七一元（指全部收入扣除生产资料、税款等支出，按不变价格计算）。1956年湖南在严重灾害的情况下，每户农家的纯收入仍达八十三点二元，每人每年的实物消费（包括粮食、食油、肉类、棉布等）比战前最高水平都有了增加。土地改革以来，湖南已有80％的贫雇农生活上升到中农水平。因为自然灾害和人口过多等原因，农村中还有13.2％户的生活比较困难，他们每人每年的平均消费量为：粮食四百六十八斤，食油二斤十五两，肉类五斤十五两……这说明他们的生活还不算顶苦的。
    某些右派分子发出了农民生活比过去降低了的叫声，无非是反映了少数地主剥削者的意见。因为农村中生活水平真正比过去降低的不是广大农民，而是一小撮地主高利贷者。他们过去靠剥削生活，一旦要他们从事劳动而生活比过去有所降低，难道不是完全应该的吗？
    工农之间的差别究竟怎样
    在大量的事实面前，有些人不得不承认农民的生活的确比过去改善了，但是，他们说农民的生活同工人比起来还是改善得太慢，而且工农之间的生活水平相差太远了。
    实际情况究竟怎样呢？根据中国科学院经济研究所和国家统计局的调查，中国职工和中国农民平均实际消费额的增长情况如下：
    抗日战争前  1936年五年计划前一年  1952年1956年　　1956为1936年的％
    职工　130　　167.7　　199.8　　153.7
    农民　61.2　　72.8　　84.2　　137.6
    上表可以看出，1956年职工的实物消费额，比1936年提高了一半，农民的实物消费额也提高了三分之一，从1952到1956年职工消费额每年平均增长4.5％，农民消费额每年平均增长3.7％。职工和农民的消费比例1952年为二点三零比一，到1956年缩小为二点一八比一，1955年职工增加工资较多，而这一年农业方面却发生了自然灾害，以致形成了职工和农民的消费水平略有扩大，但是如果再扣除城乡物价差别等因素，则1952年职工与农民消费水平的比例为一点八三比一，1955年为一点七八比一，1956年则为一点九五比一，应该说明：上述职工的消费比例包括一部分高级知识分子在内，因而在一定程度上扩大了工人和农民的消费水平。如果扣除了这部分因素，工农之间的差别并不是很大。
    周恩来总理说：1956年，职工全年的平均工资是六百一十元，比农民一家的全家收入高一倍多。如果只从收入的货币数字比较，似乎工农生活确是很悬殊，但是，如果将城乡不同的生活条件估计在内，情况就不同了。在农村维持有吃有穿的生活水平，从全国看来，大约每人每月的平均开支只需五元，在城市维持同等的生活水平，却需要十元，因此，我们认为：工农生活水平固然有差别，但是，并不是过分悬殊，而且工人的劳动生产率比农民高得多，因此，在工农之间保持一个合理的差别，也是应该的。
    随着工农收入的增加和物质生活的改善，工农的文化生活也有了显著的提高，如高等学校和中等学校中出身工农家庭的学生人数有了很大的增长：
                      1952年　　1956年　　1956为1952年的％
    高等学校学生（万人）　　19.4　　40.8　　210.3
    其中工农家庭出身的（万人）　　4.0　　13.9　　347.5
    工农家庭学生所占比重（％）　　20.5　　34.1　　——
    中等学校学生（万人）　　315　　601　　191.0
    其中工农家庭出身的（万人）　　178　　396　　222.5
    工农家庭学生所占的比重（％）　　56.6　　65.9　　——
    上表所说的工农家庭出身的学生是指体力劳动的工农家庭子弟、一般职员子弟不包括在内。
    从上表的数字中可以清楚地看出，四年来工农子弟进入高等学校的已经增加了近两倍半；进入中等学校的增加了一倍多。1956年高等学校中的工农子弟超过了三分之一，中等学校已经达到三分之二。这也是中国历史上从来没有的。
    上述一切事实，说明了解放以来我国工人和农民的生活水平有了很大的改善。这种生活水平比起工业发达的国家来说，当然还是很低的，但就中国历史情况来说则是从来没有的；我国历史上的所谓升平盛世（如唐朝的开元、清朝的乾嘉）都是在开国以后一百年间达到的，而中国共产党领导下的新中国，仅仅在短短七年时间，出现了真正的升平盛世。如果不是共产党的正确领导和优越的社会制度，怎能设想取得这样大的成绩呢？我们知道，人民生活的改善是由生产力的发展水平来决定的，目前，我国工农业发展速度很快，而在社会主义工业化的进程中困难还是很多，需要全国人民艰苦奋斗、克勤克俭来积累建设资金，发展社会生产力，只有社会生产力不断提高，我国劳动人民的生活水平才能得到更多的改善。
