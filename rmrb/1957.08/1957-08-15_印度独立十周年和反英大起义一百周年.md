Tenth Anniversary of Indian Independence and Centennial of the Anti-British Uprising

Today (August 15th) is the tenth anniversary of the independence of the Republic of India. This year also marks the centennial of the great anti-British uprising of the Indian people. The Indian government has decided to hold grand events across the country starting today to commemorate these two historically significant events.

India is an ancient civilization with a long history. However, due to the eastward expansion of Western colonial forces, India was subjected to invasion and plunder by countries such as Portugal, Britain, the Netherlands, and France in the 16th century. Later, Britain gradually ousted other colonial powers and became the main invader, gradually developing from economic exploitation to direct rule over India. In 1757, India became Britain's largest colony in the Far East.

The bloody rule and brutal exploitation of India by the British aroused resolute resistance from the Indian people. The "Anti-British Uprising" a hundred years ago was the largest and most damaging to the British colonialists among the thousands of struggles by the Indian people for independence and freedom.

On May 10, 1857, Indian soldiers stationed in the British army in Meerut (near Delhi), bravely initiated the anti-British uprising to resist British oppression of Indian soldiers and humiliation of Hindus and Muslims. The rebel army was supported by residents inside and outside Delhi, liberated Delhi, and established a rebel regime. Subsequently, various places responded, and the uprising spread like wildfire to all of northern India and most of central India. The British colonial rulers hurriedly dispatched invading forces sent to China and Iran to India to launch a large-scale offensive against the insurgents in various places. The Indian people rose up to resist the enemy and fought bloody battles for two years, writing countless epic pages in the battles to defend the uprising centers of Delhi, Lucknow, and other regions.

Although the uprising failed, the Indian people's struggle for national independence unfolded widely in various forms.

During World War II, British colonies in the Far East were successively occupied by Japanese imperialism, and the flames of national liberation rose higher and higher. At this time, Britain's colonial position in India was in jeopardy, and it had to adopt a policy of concession, sending the Cripps Mission to India in 1942 to negotiate with India. Cripps' plan only agreed that India would be a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth and did not agree to the formation of an interim government led by Indians, so the negotiations broke down. In 1945, Governor-General Wavell convened the Simla Conference, but the meeting did not yield results due to differences of opinion among the Indian negotiators.

After World War II, the Indian people's struggle for national independence reached an unprecedented height. The uprising of Indian soldiers in the British Royal Indian Navy in February 1946 dealt a heavy blow to British colonial rule in India. At this time, Britain's strength was greatly weakened after the war, and it had to consider changing its policy towards India, attempting to prevent its position in India from being completely lost.

In March 1946, Britain sent a Cabinet Mission to India for negotiations, but the negotiations broke down again because Britain insisted on unreasonable demands such as dividing India and maintaining military occupation.

The delay and breakdown of the Anglo-Indian negotiations prompted the Indian people to intensify their struggle for national liberation. In particular, the workers' strike movement rose to an unprecedented height. In 1946, the number of strikers reached two million, equivalent to three times that of 1945. The number of strikers in the first eight months of 1947 was close to the total number for the entire year of 1946.

On June 3, 1947, Britain announced the Mountbatten Plan, characterized by the partition of India and Pakistan. Both the Congress Party and the Muslim League accepted this plan. In July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act. In August, Britain transferred power in India to the Congress Party and the Muslim League. On August 15, the two dominions of India and Pakistan were formally established.

After declaring independence, India implemented a constitution on January 26, 1950, declaring India an independent and sovereign democratic republic. After the birth of the Republic of India, it has carried out tremendous work in consolidating independence and developing its economy and culture, and at the same time, it is playing an increasingly important role in the struggle for peace in Asia and the world.

### 印度独立十周年和反英大起义一百周年

    印度独立十周年和反英大起义一百周年
    今天（8月15日）是印度共和国独立十周年纪念日。同时，今年又是印度人民反英大起义的一百周年。印度政府决定从今天起在全国各地举行盛大的活动，来纪念历史上这两个具有伟大意义的事件。
    印度是个历史悠久的文明古国。但是，由于西方殖民势力东侵，印度在十六世纪就遭到葡、英、荷、法等国的侵略和掠夺。后来，英国逐步排挤了其他殖民国家，成为主要的入侵者，并逐渐地从经济剥削发展到对印度的直接统治。1757年，印度沦为英国在远东最大的殖民地。
    英国对印度的血腥统治和残酷剥削，激起了印度人民的坚决反抗。一百年前的“反英大起义”，就是印度人民争取独立自由的千百次斗争中规模最大、给予英国殖民者打击最沉重的一次。
    1857年5月10日，驻在米勒特镇（德里附近）的英国军队中的印度籍士兵为了反抗英国人对印籍士兵的压迫和对印度教、伊斯兰教徒的凌辱，英勇地揭开了反英起义的序幕。起义军得到德里城内外居民的响应，解放了德里，建立了起义政权。接着各地纷纷响应，起义像野火一样蔓延到印度北部全部地区和中部的大部分地区。英国的殖民统治者慌忙调遣派往中国和在伊朗的侵略军，赶到印度，向各地起义者大举进攻。印度人民奋起抗敌，血战两年之久，在保卫起义中心德里、勒克脑和其他地区的战斗中写下了无数可歌可泣的史页。
    起义虽然遭到失败，但是印度人民争取民族独立的斗争以各种方式此起彼伏地广泛地展开。
    第二次大战期间，英国在远东的殖民地陆续被日本帝国主义侵占，民族解放的火焰日益高涨。这时，英国在印度的殖民地位岌岌可危，不得不采取让步政策，在1942年派出克利浦斯代表团同印度谈判。克利浦斯的计划只同意印度作为英联邦自治领，不同意组织印度人领导的临时政府，谈判因而破裂。1945年，总督魏菲尔又召开了西姆拉英印谈判，由于印度谈判代表之间意见有分歧，会议也没有获得结果。
    第二次世界大战后，印度人民争取民族独立的斗争空前高涨。1946年2月爆发的英国皇家印度海军的印度籍士兵的起义，给予英国在印度的殖民统治沉重的打击。这时，英国的力量在战后大大削弱，也不得不考虑改变对印政策，企图使它在印度的地位不致丧失殆尽。
    1946年3月，英国派遣内阁特使团赴印谈判，但由于英国坚持分裂印度和保持军事占领等无理主张，谈判又告破裂。
    英印谈判的拖延和破裂，促使印度人民加紧争取民族解放的斗争。特别是工人罢工运动空前高涨。1946年罢工人数达二百万人，相当于1945年的三倍。1947年头八个月的罢工人数已接近1946年全年的总数。
    1947年6月3日，英国公布了以印巴分治为特点的蒙巴顿方案。国大党和穆斯林联盟都接受了这个方案。1947年7月，英议会通过印度独立法。8月，英国把印度的政权移交给国大党和穆斯林联盟。8月15日，印度和巴基斯坦两个自治领正式宣布成立。
    印度宣布独立后，于1950年1月26日实行了宪法，宣布印度为独立自主的民主共和国。印度共和国诞生后，在巩固独立、发展经济文化方面进行了巨大的工作，同时在争取亚洲和世界和平的斗争中也发挥着日益重大的作用。
