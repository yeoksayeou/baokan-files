　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 21st: A mass rally of more than 40,000 people was held in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, on August 20th to welcome President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and President Ho Chi Minh delivered speeches at the rally.

　　Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej first gave a brief introduction to the history of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle to the masses present. He said that the strength of the socialist camp lies in unity. Therefore, the Romanian Workers' Party, guided by the principle of Marxist-Leninist internationalism, must resolutely fight for the unity of the international workers' movement. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej said that the Romanian Workers' Party and government fully support the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals, fully support the Geneva Accords on the Vietnam issue, and fully sympathize with and support the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence.

　　Next, President Ho Chi Minh spoke. He said that during this 45-day journey of more than 22,000 kilometers, he felt the unparalleled strength of the socialist family everywhere and saw peaceful labor for socialist construction everywhere. The same is true in Romania, where I have seen the achievements of thirteen years of peaceful construction. Ho Chi Minh said that we are all loyal to communism, we must safeguard the unity of the socialist camp, we must safeguard the unity of Vietnam and Romania, and our unity is invincible.

　　胡志明结束东欧访问离罗返国
　  布加勒斯特群众集会欢迎国宾
    据新华社布加勒斯特21日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明今天中午十二时半乘飞机离开罗马尼亚回国。
    罗马尼亚工人党和政府领导人乔治乌—德治、斯托伊卡等都到机场欢送。
    胡志明主席在7月6日离开河内以后，总共访问了十一个兄弟国家，走了两万二千多公里。
    据新华社布加勒斯特21日电　罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特在8月20日举行了四万多人的群众大会，欢迎越南民主共和国主席胡志明。乔治乌—德治同志和胡志明主席在大会上分别讲了话。
    乔治乌—德治首先向到会的群众简要地介绍了越南人民革命斗争的历史。他说，社会主义阵营的力量在于团结。因此，以马克思列宁主义的国际主义为指导原则的罗马尼亚工人党，要坚决为国际工人运动的团结而斗争。乔治乌—德治说，罗马尼亚工人党和政府完全支持苏联的裁军建议，完全支持日内瓦会议关于越南问题的协议，完全同情和支持越南人民为民族独立所进行的斗争。
    接着，胡志明主席讲话。他说，我在这次历时四十五天、走了二万二千多公里的旅途中，到处都感到社会主义大家庭的无比的力量，到处都看到进行社会主义建设的和平劳动。在罗马尼亚也一样，我看到了十三年来和平建设的成就。胡志明说，我们都忠实于共产主义，我们要维护社会主义阵营的团结，我们要维护越罗两国的团结，我们的团结是不可战胜的。
