Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The struggle to counterattack the bourgeois right-wing elements in Beijing's literary and art circles is now being fully launched. A number of right-wing elements have been exposed in drama, literature, art education, and fine arts.

According to materials already revealed in the drama circles, the Zhang-Luo alliance's rampant offensive against the Beijing drama circles was carried out through several lines of conspiracy activities, attempting to usurp the leadership of the drama circles. Luo Longji directly instructed his henchmen, right-wing elements Wen Yan and Dai Ya, to carry out activities at the Beijing People's Art Theatre. In addition to vigorously developing their organization in the theater, attempting to create a "power faction" to seize the theater's leadership, they also actively worked to restore the "China Traveling Theatre" of the Anti-Japanese War period, planning to pull a group of people from the theater and ruin the national theater. Zhang Bojun sent his henchman Xing Wenxin to the Beijing Folk Professional Troupe and the China Peking Opera Theatre to develop organizations and establish strongholds. At that time, Li Wanchun, head of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1 and deputy director of the Beijing Peking Opera Workers' Union, acted as the backbone of their conspiracy activities, running around everywhere to develop the organization.

In the literary field, people have peeled off the masks of "writer" Xiao Qian and Zhang Yousong, who flaunted the sign of "translator," in the anti-rightist struggle, revealing their ugly faces of opposing the Communist Party and socialism. In the anti-rightist struggle, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles repelled a counter-current of anti-communism launched by right-wing elements Shi Baiwu, Sun Yuchun, Kao Cheng, and right-wing element within the Communist Party, Zhang Mingquan. Shi Baiwu, deputy director of the study department of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, fabricated facts at the rectification forum to incite the masses to resist the leadership of the Communist Party. Sun Yuchun, editor of "Beijing Literature and Art," also claimed to have "participated in the rectification with a vengeful mood." Zhang Mingquan openly incited Communist Party members and the masses to refuse to implement the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on rectification, and supported the slanders of non-Party right-wing elements, saying: "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is a concentrated manifestation of factionalism within the Party."

A number of right-wing elements have also been exposed in the capital's art colleges. Sun Jiaxiu, a right-wing element at the Central Academy of Drama, used the China Democratic League organization to launch vicious attacks on the Communist Party and socialist literature and art. She once used Shakespeare's words from "Othello" to denigrate today's new society as "everything will fall into chaos." Beijing Art Normal College exposed the reactionary words and deeds of Liu Xue'an, the deputy director of the college's preparatory committee and the director of the China Democratic League branch.

With the full launch of the anti-rightist struggle, writers, poets, actors, painters, and folk professional artists in Beijing have successively joined the struggle. They will more deeply and meticulously expose, pursue, and criticize right-wing elements.

    作家、演员、画家、民间艺人纷纷投入斗争
    北京文艺界右派分子一一现形
    据新华社31日讯　北京市文艺界的反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争，目前正全面展开。在戏剧、文学、艺术教育和美术等方面，都揭发出一批右派分子。
    据戏剧界已揭发的材料证明，章罗联盟向北京戏剧界猖狂进攻，是分成几条线进行阴谋活动，企图篡夺戏剧界的领导权。罗隆基直接指使他的爪牙、右派分子文燕、戴涯在北京人民艺术剧院进行活动。他们在剧院里除了大力发展组织，企图造成“实力派”篡取剧院领导权外，还积极活动以恢复抗战时期的“中国旅行剧团”为名，计划从剧院拉走一批人，把国家剧院搞垮。章伯钧则派邢文鑫这个爪牙到北京市民间职业剧团和中国京剧院里发展组织，建立据点。当时，北京市京剧一团团长、北京市京剧工作者联合会副主任委员李万春充当了他们阴谋活动的骨干分子，到处奔走发展组织。
    在文学领域内，人们从反右派斗争中剥开了“作家”萧乾、挂着“翻译家”招牌的张友松的外衣，露出了他们反共产党反社会主义的丑恶面貌。北京市文联在反右派斗争中，击退了右派分子施白芜、孙毓椿、考诚和共产党内的右派分子张明权掀起的一股反共产党的逆流。北京市文联学习部副部长施白芜在整风座谈会上捏造事实煽动群众对抗共产党的领导。“北京文艺”编辑孙毓椿也自称是“抱着复仇的心情参加整风”，张明权公开煽动共产党员和群众拒绝执行中共北京市委关于整风的指示，并支持党外右派分子的诬蔑说：“肃反是党内宗派主义的集中表现”。
    首都各艺术院校也揭发出一批右派分子。中央戏剧学院的右派分子孙家琇利用民盟组织，向共产党向社会主义文学艺术进行了恶毒的攻击。她曾借用莎士比亚的“奥赛罗”中的话，诋毁今天的新社会是“一切将陷于混沌”。北京艺术师范学院揭发出该院筹备委员会副主任、民盟支部主任委员刘雪庵的反动言行。
    随着反右派斗争的全面展开，北京市的作家、诗人、演员、画家和民间职业艺人都相继投入了这个斗争。他们将更加深入地、细致地揭发、追击和批判右派分子。
