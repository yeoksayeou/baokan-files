Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 17th. In August, another batch of new industrial buildings began construction in Shaanxi Province. The more than thirty key industrial projects scheduled to be built in Shaanxi during the First Five-Year Plan have now basically entered the stage of full-scale construction.

1957 is the year with the largest industrial construction scale in the history of Shaanxi. In this year's total construction area, industrial building area accounts for about six-tenths, not only exceeding the completed industrial building area last year, but also increasing by more than double the total industrial building area of the previous four years. By the end of this year, more than ten projects in the province will be completed and put into production, and another seven projects will complete civil engineering. Only one-tenth of the construction investment needs to be carried over to 1958 according to the plan for continued completion.

After the completion of all the industrial projects started during the First Five-Year Plan, Shaanxi Province will form a new industrial center. A batch of newly built modern state-owned machinery industrial enterprises will occupy an important position in the country in terms of the quantity, variety, and precision of their products. Among them, not only will a new type of petroleum exploration machinery manufacturing industry be born, but also an instrument industry supplying automation and mechanization equipment will emerge. The construction of several electric power equipment factories, which are under full-scale construction, will greatly advance the development of China's electrical manufacturing industry. The power capacitor factory, which is to be put into production this year, will supply the national power industry with more than ten kinds of capacitors with different properties. The other electric factories under construction are also the largest and most advanced factories of their kind in China. Some of them can produce four complete sets of electrical porcelain equipment; some can produce dozens of kinds of insulating materials and other important products that have never been produced domestically; and some factories can also produce complete sets of power distribution equipment.

The construction of Shaanxi's fuel and power industry has made the Tongchuan mining area, built on the Weibei coalfield, the black waist of Shaanxi, one of the three major coal bases already determined in the Northwest. The coal needed by Shaanxi will gradually be taken entirely from the Weibei coalfield. Here, in addition to the newly built Sanlidong shaft put into production in July this year, the remaining two pairs of shafts and the horizontal adit are under construction. The Wangshi’ao shaft, designed with Soviet assistance and with an annual output of 1.2 million tons, is also expected to start construction within the year. Due to the construction of two large-scale thermal power plants near Xi'an during the First Five-Year Plan, Xi'an has become a power supply center.

In Shaanxi, which is rich in cotton, a cotton textile printing and dyeing industrial base has also been initially formed. The last textile factory in the newly built first group of cotton textile printing and dyeing joint enterprises—the Sixth State-owned Cotton Mill—will be test-run in September this year; currently, only the large-scale printing and dyeing factory remains under construction. By the end of this year, the province will be able to operate 600,000 new and old spindles and 14,000 looms, producing a large amount of cotton yarn and cloth.

### 改变工业分布偏在沿海的形势  新工业中心正在陕西形成  今年工业建筑面积超过前四年总和的一倍

    改变工业分布偏在沿海的形势
    新工业中心正在陕西形成
    今年工业建筑面积超过前四年总和的一倍
    新华社西安17日电  8月份，陕西省又有一批新工业建筑物开始施工。第一个五年计划期间规定的在陕西兴建的三十多个重点工业项目，现在都已经基本上进入了全面施工阶段。
    1957年是陕西历史上工业建设规模最大的一年。在今年的建筑总面积中，工业建筑面积约占十分之六左右，不但超过去年工业建筑的竣工面积，比起前四年工业建筑面积总和约增加一倍多。到今年底，全省要有十多个项目竣工投入生产，另有七个项目将完成土建工程，只有十分之一的建设投资，需按计划跨年度到1958年继续完成。
    在第一个五年计划期间开工建设的工业项目全部完成以后，陕西省就将形成一个新兴的工业中心。新建设起来的一批现代化的国营机械工业企业，产品的数量、种类和精密程度都将在全国占有重要地位。其中不但有新型的石油勘探机械修造工业诞生，还有供应自动化机械化设备的仪表工业问世。正在全面兴建的几个电力工业器材厂建成以后，将使我国电器制造工业大大向前发展一步。今年就要投入生产的电力电容器厂，将要供应全国电力工业十几种不同性能的电容器。正在建设的另外几个电工厂，也是我国现有同类厂中最大最先进的工厂。它们有的能产四种全套电瓷设备；有的能产几十种绝缘材料和国内从未生产过的其他重要产品；有的厂还能生产成套配电设备等。
    陕西燃料和动力工业的建设，已使建在陕西黑腰带——渭北煤田上的铜川矿区，成为西北业已确定的三大煤炭基地之一。陕西需要的煤炭就要逐步全部取自渭北煤田。在这里，除了今年7月间投入生产的新建三里洞竖井外，其余二对竖井和平洞正在兴建。苏联帮助设计的一对年产一百二十万吨的王石凹竖井，预计也将在年内动工。由于第一个五年计划期间在西安附近建成两座大型火力热电厂，已使西安变成了供电中心。
    在盛产棉花的陕西，棉纺织印染工业基地也已经初步形成。新建的第一组棉纺织印染联合企业中的最后一座纺织厂——国棉六厂，在今年9月份就要试车生产；目前就剩下大型印染厂正在施工。到今年底，全省就可以开动新旧六十万枚纱锭和一万四千台布机，大量生产棉纱和布匹。
