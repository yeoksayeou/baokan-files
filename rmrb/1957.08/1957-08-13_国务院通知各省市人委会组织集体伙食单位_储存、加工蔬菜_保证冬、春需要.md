Xinhua News Agency Report: The State Council issued a notice on the 10th, requesting the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities to organize collective catering units in cities, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas, such as government offices, military units, factories, and schools, to store and process vegetables for their own consumption during the winter and spring seasons.

The notice stated: In recent years, in order to improve the vegetable supply in cities, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas, various localities have done a great deal of work and achieved certain results. However, the current work of storing and processing autumn vegetables in various localities is far behind the needs of the growing population in cities, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas. During the peak season of autumn vegetable marketing, there is an oversupply, resulting in a lot of vegetable spoilage and a rapid decline in prices; while during the off-season of winter and spring vegetables, there is a serious shortage of vegetables in the market, and prices rise accordingly. This situation is very unfavorable to both producers and consumers. In order to change this situation, in addition to continuing to strengthen the leadership of vegetable production and appropriately strengthening the operation of vegetables by state-owned commercial departments, the People's Committees of various localities must also mobilize and organize consumers to do a good job in storing and processing autumn vegetables.

The notice requires the People's Committees of various localities to widely explain to collective catering units such as government offices, military units, factories, and schools that storing and processing vegetables themselves can ensure the supply of vegetables during the winter and spring off-season, reduce seasonal price differences, and eat inexpensive vegetables. Decentralized storage by each catering unit can also save national capital construction investment, which is very beneficial to the country and the broad masses of workers, officers, soldiers, and students. Each unit should actively participate in this work.

The notice stated that the People's Committees of various localities should instruct state-owned commercial departments engaged in vegetable operations to propose plans for government offices, military units, factories, and schools to store and process vegetables based on local conditions, and arrange them through the competent administrative departments. The varieties and quantities of vegetables stored and processed by each unit should be determined according to needs, possibilities, and technical preparedness. Units with good conditions can do more, units with poor conditions can do less first, and units without conditions should actively prepare. It is required that each unit gradually rely on its own reserves to solve most of the vegetables needed in the winter and spring seasons year by year.

The notice stated that the vegetables needed for storage and processing by various government offices, military units, factories, schools, and other units should be purchased and distributed in a unified manner by the local vegetable operating departments to avoid causing market chaos. The equipment needed for storing and processing vegetables should be solved by each unit itself. The supply of pickle jars in various localities should be planned uniformly by relevant authorities, and no rush purchases are allowed.

The notice concluded by saying that the state-owned vegetable commercial departments in various localities should strengthen technical guidance on the methods of storing and processing vegetables, and summarize and promote the effective experience of the masses in storing and pickling vegetables. Each unit must also designate special personnel to be responsible for the storage and processing of vegetables to prevent unnecessary mold, deterioration, and losses.

    国务院通知各省市人委会组织集体伙食单位
    储存、加工蔬菜　保证冬、春需要
    新华社讯　国务院于10日发出通知，要求各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会组织城市、工矿区和林区的机关、部队、工厂、学校等集体伙食单位储存和加工冬、春季自用的蔬菜。
    通知说：几年来，为了改进城市、工矿区和林区的蔬菜供应，各地做了很多工作，取得了一定的成绩。但是目前各地秋季蔬菜的储存和加工工作却远远落后于城市、工矿区和林区人口增长的需要。在秋季蔬菜上市旺季的时候，便形成供过于求，以至发生很多蔬菜腐烂的现象，价格也迅速下跌；而当进入冬、春蔬菜淡季的时候，市场上又发生严重缺菜的现象。价格也随着上涨。这种情况对于生产者和消费者都是很不利的。为了改变这种情况，各地人民委员会除了继续加强对蔬菜生产的领导和适当加强国营商业部门经营蔬菜的力量以外，还必须动员和组织消费者做好秋菜的储存和加工工作。
    通知要求各地人民委员会应广泛地向机关、部队、工厂、学校等集体伙食单位说明：自己储存和加工蔬菜可以保证冬、春缺菜季节的蔬菜供应，可以减少季节性价格上涨的差额，吃到廉价的蔬菜。各伙食单位分散储存，还可以节省国家基本建设投资，对于国家和广大职工、官兵、学生都是很有利的，各单位应当主动地积极地参加这一工作。
    通知说，各地人民委员会应当责成经营蔬菜的国营商业部门根据当地具体情况提出机关、部队、工厂、学校储存和加工蔬菜的规划方案，通过各主管行政部门进行安排。各单位储存和加工蔬菜的品种和数量，应当根据需要、可能和技术准备情况来规定，有条件的单位可以多搞一些，条件较差的单位先少搞一些，无条件的单位应积极准备；要求各单位对冬、春季节所需要的蔬菜，分年地逐步做到大部分依靠自己储备来解决。
    通知说，各机关、部队、工厂、学校等单位储存和加工所需要的蔬菜，应当由当地蔬菜经营部门统一组织采购和分配，以免引起市场的紊乱；储存和加工蔬菜所需要的设备由各单位自筹解决。各地对于腌菜菜缸的供应，应由有关机关统一规划，不得抢购。
    通知最后说，各地国营蔬菜商业部门对于储存和加工蔬菜的方法，应当加强技术指导，总结和推广群众行之有效的储菜、腌菜经验；各单位也必须指定专人负责蔬菜的储存和加工工作，防止不应有的霉烂变质和损失。
