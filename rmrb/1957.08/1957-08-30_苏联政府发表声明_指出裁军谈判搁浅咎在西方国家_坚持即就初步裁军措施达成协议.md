Xinhua News Agency, London, August 29th, TASS: Soviet representative Zorin read a statement from the Soviet government regarding disarmament negotiations at the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meeting on the 27th.

The statement pointed out that the Disarmament Subcommittee had held meetings for five months, but it had not made any progress in resolving the problems it faced. During this period, Western governments have been producing various armaments, especially weapons of mass destruction such as atomic and hydrogen weapons, on an even larger scale. The decision-makers of Western governments, especially those of the United States government, are in fact unwilling to reach a disarmament agreement.

The Soviet Union Has Always Strived to Reach an Agreement

The statement said that the Soviet government has always strived to make the work of the subcommittee as effective as possible and to ensure the rapid adoption of relevant decisions. In the first few days of this session of the subcommittee, it submitted a proposal including a comprehensive disarmament plan for discussion. However, this proposal was not supported by representatives of Western countries. Representatives of these countries stated that they were not prepared to completely resolve the disarmament issue at this time, and that they intended to negotiate only on reaching an agreement on partial disarmament measures.

Taking into account this attitude of Western countries and in the spirit of breaking the deadlock in disarmament work, the Soviet government proposed on April 30th that partial disarmament measures be taken that are urgently needed in the current situation and that could pave the way for a comprehensive disarmament agreement. The Soviet Union suggested that all countries should solemnly pledge not to use atomic and hydrogen weapons of any type for military purposes, as the first step in banning atomic weapons. At the same time, considering that the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons is an urgent matter, the Soviet Union also suggested that, as a primary measure, this issue be extracted from the overall disarmament issue and resolved immediately. Later, in order to reach a mutually acceptable agreement, the Soviet government also proposed temporarily stopping nuclear weapons testing for a period of two or three years and establishing corresponding international supervision.

Western Countries Refuse to Stop Nuclear Testing

The statement pointed out that, however, Western countries have so far been unable to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the issue of stopping testing or even temporarily stopping nuclear weapons testing for two or three years. Until recently, they did not even hide their negative attitude towards this proposal. Under the unanimous demand of the people of all countries to stop testing weapons of mass destruction, the United States and other Western countries are currently adopting a tactic. The United States currently does not outwardly oppose the proposal to temporarily stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, but at the same time deliberately entangles the implementation of this proposal with other disarmament measures (such as banning the production of atomic weapons and reducing conventional armaments), and these disarmament measures have caused many difficulties due to the position of Western countries and cannot reach an agreement. In this way, the United States has made it impossible to reach an agreement on temporarily stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The discussion in the Disarmament Subcommittee on stopping nuclear weapons testing shows that the governments of Western countries, especially the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, should bear full responsibility for continuing atomic and hydrogen bomb testing.

As for the issue of banning the use of atomic weapons, Western governments are trying to make it seem as if the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons is legal, and that what can be negotiated is not abandoning the use of such weapons, but only determining the conditions and circumstances under which such weapons can be used. Accepting this statement will not only fail to lead to a ban on nuclear weapons, but will in fact legalize the use of such weapons.

The West Also Avoids Reducing Conventional Armaments

Regarding the issue of reducing conventional armaments, the Soviet government's statement pointed out that the Soviet government is striving to end the expansion of armaments, so it put forward very specific proposals regarding the reduction of the number of armed forces, armaments, and military budgets of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. However, Western countries have adopted a negative attitude towards the Soviet Union's proposals, using various fabricated excuses and proposing various conditions to avoid reaching an agreement on the issue of realizing actual reductions in armed forces and armaments.

In addition, Western countries also avoid discussing the Soviet proposal to abolish military bases on foreign territories and withdraw troops from foreign territories.

The So-Called Open Skies is Just a Deception

The statement pointed out that Western governments have put forward the issue of supervision as the primary issue, and want to use the discussion of this issue to replace the discussion of the main issues of the negotiations, the disarmament measures themselves. The Soviet government has made many efforts to bring the attitudes of the participants in the negotiations closer on the issue of international supervision of disarmament. For example, given that the United States and its allies have proposed the issue of aerial photography as a condition for signing a disarmament agreement, the Soviet government is willing to take steps to meet the requirements of these countries. In the proposal submitted by the Soviet government to the Disarmament Subcommittee for review on April 30th, it advocated establishing aerial photography zones in the central European region, where the main armed forces of the two opposing military blocs are stationed. The Soviet Union also suggested establishing aerial photography zones in the Far East.

However, the United States and other Western countries did not support the above-mentioned Soviet proposal. Instead, on August 2nd, they put forward a new proposal on aerial photography, stipulating flights over the entire territories of the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union. As can be seen from the statements of the leaders of the US government and military activists, the US and NATO military leadership want to use aerial photography to master the most complete information about the distribution of the most important industrial and transportation centers in the Soviet Union.

It is worth noting that the Western countries' proposal does not stipulate aerial photography in the territories of many countries where military bases of NATO members are located. This puts the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies, which are also required to open up aerial inspections, at an unequal disadvantage.

As for the US's other proposal - aerial photography in the Arctic region - this proposal may not require serious research, because flying in the desolate and sparsely populated Arctic region is of no benefit to disarmament or to preventing one country from suddenly attacking another.

Many Countries are Excluded from Disarmament Negotiations

Due to the opposition of the representatives of Western countries, the subcommittee was unable to adopt a unanimous resolution on the disarmament issues discussed. The reason for this situation is primarily that the ruling groups of the countries participating in the subcommittee, with the exception of the Soviet Union, are not interested in disarmament.

At present, Western countries not only exclude many major countries that are concerned about resolving the disarmament issue from participating in the work of the subcommittee, but also several continents - Asia, Africa, Latin America, etc. - are not represented at all in the subcommittee.

In addition, Western countries also forced the subcommittee to accept secret meeting working methods. This makes it impossible for public opinion to know the truth, and the true situation within the subcommittee is often falsely reported to the outside world. The United States and other Western countries want to use the subcommittee to confuse the public, spread unrealistic fantasies, and deceive the people.

The Realization of Disarmament Depends on the Sincerity of the West

The statement concluded that there is indeed an opportunity now to reach an agreement on certain urgent measures regarding disarmament and preventing the threat of atomic war. It is important not to miss these opportunities. The primary task of countries that bear the primary responsibility for resolving the disarmament issue is to show due willingness and sincerity to reach a disarmament agreement, and to seriously discuss the proposals that have been submitted to the United Nations Disarmament Committee subcommittee for study.

Finally, considering the need to move from words to deeds and lay the foundation for practical measures in disarmament, the Soviet government currently proposes once again to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada that, before reaching an agreement on other disarmament issues, they immediately reach an agreement on urgent preliminary disarmament measures first. These measures include: immediately and unconditionally stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, or temporarily stopping such testing for two or three years and establishing corresponding supervision; all countries refusing to use atomic and hydrogen weapons; reducing the armed forces of all countries to a certain level; reducing the armaments and military budgets of all countries; abolishing military bases on foreign territories; reducing the armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France stationed in Germany; and establishing international supervision over the implementation of disarmament measures.

### 苏联政府发表声明　指出裁军谈判搁浅咎在西方国家  坚持即就初步裁军措施达成协议

　　苏联政府发表声明
　　指出裁军谈判搁浅咎在西方国家
　  坚持即就初步裁军措施达成协议
    据新华社29日讯　塔斯社伦敦讯：苏联代表佐林27日在联合国裁军小组委员会会议上宣读了苏联政府关于裁军谈判的声明。
    声明指出，裁军小组委员会已经举行了五个月的会议，但是它在解决所面临的问题上并没有前进一步。在这个期间，西方国家政府在更大规模地生产各种军备，特别是生产像原子武器和氢武器这类大规模毁灭性武器。西方国家政府的决策人，首先是美国政府的决策人实际上并不愿意达成裁军协议。
    苏联一向竭力争取达成协议
    声明说，苏联政府一直努力使小组委员会的工作尽可能地更有效力并且保证迅速通过相应的决定。它在本届小组委员会会议的最初几天就把一个包括广泛裁军计划的建议提交会议讨论。但是这个建议并没有得到西方国家代表的支持。这些国家的代表们表示他们根本不准备在目前彻底解决裁军问题，他们说，他们打算只就达成局部裁军措施协定进行谈判。
    由于考虑到西方国家这种态度以及本着使裁军的工作摆脱僵局的愿望，苏联政府在4月30日曾经建议采取在目前的情况下刻不容缓的并且能为全面裁军协定铺平道路的局部裁军措施。苏联建议，各国应当庄严保证不把各种类型的原子武器和氢武器用于军事目的，以作为禁止原子武器的第一个步骤。同时，考虑到关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题是个迫在燃眉的问题，苏联还建议作为一个首要的措施，把这个问题从全面裁军问题中抽出来立即加以解决。苏联政府后来为了达成双方都可以接受的协议，还曾经建议那怕在两三年的时期内暂时停止核武器试验和建立相应的国际监督。
    西方国家不肯停试核武器
    声明指出，可是，西方国家在停止试验或者那怕在两三年内暂时停止试验核武器的问题上至今还不能和苏联取得一致意见。它们直到最近甚至不隐瞒它们对这个建议的否定态度。在各国人民一致要求停止试验大规模毁灭性武器的情况下，美国和其他西方国家目前采取一种策略。美国目前在表面上并不反对暂时停止试验原子武器和氢武器的建议，但是同时又故意把实现这个建议同其他的裁军措施（例如禁止原子武器生产和裁减常规军备问题）纠缠在一起，而这些裁军措施也是由于西方国家的立场引起的许多困难不能取得一致意见，这样，美国就使暂时停止试验原子武器和氢武器失去了达成协议的可能性。
    裁军小组委员会关于停止核武器试验的讨论表明，西方国家的政府，首先是美国和英国的政府，应当对继续进行原子弹和氢弹的试验负完全责任。
    至于禁止使用原子武器问题，西方国家政府企图把事情说成好像使用原子武器和氢武器是合法的，可以商谈的不是放弃使用这种武器，而只是确定使用这种武器的条件和情况。接受这种说法不但不能导致禁止核武器，而且实际上是让使用这种武器合法化。
      西方也规避裁减常规军备
    谈到裁减常规军备问题，苏联政府的声明指出，苏联政府力求终止扩充军备，所以它提出了关于裁减苏、美、英、法四国武装部队人数、军备和军事预算的十分具体的建议。但是西方国家对苏联的建议却采取否定的态度，用各种杜撰的借口和提出各种条件来规避就实现实际裁减武装部队和军备的问题达成协议。
    此外，西方国家还规避讨论苏联关于撤消在外国领土上的军事基地和从外国领土撤退军队的建议。
    所谓开放天空只是一种骗局
    声明指出，西方国家政府把监督问题作为首要问题提出，想用对这个问题的讨论来代替对谈判的主要问题、裁军措施本身的讨论。苏联政府已经作了不少努力使谈判参加者在裁军的国际监督问题上的态度也接近起来。例如鉴于美国和它的同伙们提出空中摄影的问题作为签订裁军协定的条件，苏联政府愿意采取步骤迎合这些国家的要求。苏联政府在4月30日提交裁军小组委员会审查的建议中主张在两个对立军事集团主要武装力量驻扎地区——欧洲中部建立空中摄影地带，苏联同时也建议在远东建立空中摄影地带。
    可是，美国和其他西方国家没有支持上述苏联建议，它们反而在8月2日就空中摄影问题提出了一项规定在美国、加拿大和苏联全境上空飞行的新建议。从美国政府领导人和军事活动家的声明中可以看出，美国和北大西洋公约组织的军事领导机构想用空中摄影的方法掌握有关苏联最重要工业中心和交通中心分布状况的最完备的材料。
    值得注意的是，西方国家的建议没有规定在设有北大西洋军事侵略集团成员国的军事基地的许多国家的领土上进行空中摄影。这就使苏联和规定也要开放空中视察的、苏联的华沙条约盟国处于不平等的地位。
    至于说到美国的另一点建议——在北极地区进行空中摄影，这个建议未必需要认真的研究，因为在荒凉的人烟稀少的北极地区飞行，对于裁军，对于防止一国突然袭击另一国都没有什么好处。
  许多国家被排斥在裁军谈判之外
    由于西方国家代表所持的反对态度，小组委员会没有能够就所讨论的裁军问题通过一致决议。所以产生这种情况的原因首先在于，除苏联以外，参加小组委员会的各国的统治集团对裁军不感兴趣。
    目前，西方国家不仅排斥许多关心解决裁军问题的大国参加小组委员会的工作，而且有几个洲——亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲等在小组委员会内根本就没有代表。
    此外，西方国家还强迫小组委员会接受秘密会议工作方式。这就使得社会舆论不知究竟，而小组委员会内的真实状况经常被虚假地向外报道。美国和其他西方国家是想利用小组委员会来混淆视听，散布不现实的幻想和欺骗人民。
    裁军的实现取决于西方的诚意
    声明最后说，现在的确有机会来就裁军和防止原子战争威胁方面的某些刻不容缓的措施达成协议。重要的是，不要放过这些机会。对解决裁军问题首先负有责任的国家的主要任务是，应对达成裁军协议表现应有的意愿和诚意，并且认真地讨论目前已提交联合国裁军委员会小组委员会研究的建议。
    最后，考虑到必须从言论转为行动，为裁军方面的实际措施奠定基础，苏联政府目前再次建议美国、英国、法国和加拿大四国政府，在就其他裁军问题达成协议之前，立刻先就刻不容缓的初步裁军措施达成协议。这些措施包括：立刻无条件停止试验原子武器和氢武器或者在两三年内暂时停止这种试验并建立相应监督；各国拒绝使用原子武器和氢武器；把各国武装力量裁减到一定水平；裁减各国的军备和军事预算，取消在别国领土上的军事基地；裁减美国、苏联、英国和法国驻在德国的武装部队；对实现裁军措施建立国际监督。
