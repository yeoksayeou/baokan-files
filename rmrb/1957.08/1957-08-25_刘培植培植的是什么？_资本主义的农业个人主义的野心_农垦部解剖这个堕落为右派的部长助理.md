Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation held consecutive meetings of all staff members on the 22nd and 23rd to expose and criticize the anti-Party element Liu Peizhi. Liu Peizhi was the Minister Assistant of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation and the Secretary of the CCP Committee of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation. During the Great Blooming and Contending, he launched a狂猖 attack on the Party and encouraged and supported rightist elements within the ministry to attack and slander the Party.

According to the exposure, Liu Peizhi is a bourgeois individualist ambitious person. He attempted to use the opportunity of the rectification campaign to oppose the leadership of the ministry and conspire to seize the Party's leadership over state farms and land reclamation.

Liu Peizhi's ambition existed long ago. In 1953, when he was transferred from the Northeast to work in the Ministry of Agriculture, the anti-Party element Gao Gang promised him the position of Vice Minister. However, because his qualities and abilities were not commensurate with the position of Vice Minister, he was only appointed as Director. Therefore, he was very dissatisfied with the Party. Since then, in order to establish personal prestige to usurp leadership, in recent years, he has consistently slandered the achievements of the Party and the government in running state farms and land reclamation; and has promoted his own "great achievements" everywhere. In 1954, his second year as the Director of the State Farm Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, at the National State Farm Directors Conference of that year, in order to elevate himself, he did not adopt collective opinions. In his report to the meeting, he completely denied the achievements of running farms from 1948 to 1952, boasting that farms were only well-run from 1953, the year he took office as the Director of the State Farm Administration Bureau, and very arrogantly praised 1953 as the year of "great transformation" for state farms. His arrogant behavior was strictly criticized by Liao Luyan, the Minister of Agriculture at the time, but he did not correct his mistake. Later, he wrote two more books to boast about himself. In the book "On State Farms in Our Country During the Transition Period," written in 1955, in order to flaunt his achievements in leading state farms, he also one-sidedly exaggerated the role of state farms, attributing the great development of the Party's leadership in the agricultural cooperation movement to state farms, saying that the farms "guided and educated" farmers to actively participate in cooperatives.

In April 1956, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation was established, and the business scope and personnel of the original State Farm Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture were all transferred to the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation. Although Liu Peizhi had repeatedly boasted about himself in the past, attempting to climb up by elevating himself, his plan did not materialize. This time, he still did not become a Minister or Vice Minister. Therefore, his dissatisfaction with the Party turned into hatred of the Party. This year, after the Great Blooming and Contending began, he thought he had an opportunity and launched a frantic attack on the Party.

According to the exposure, his method of attacking the Party was very sinister. In order to oppose the Party's leadership and seize leadership, like the rightist elements in society, he first attempted to deny the achievements of state farms and land reclamation during the period when he did not hold a major leadership position. In order to spread his malicious thoughts, he took advantage of the opportunity when several Ministers and Vice Ministers were on business trips and wrote a book as a Minister Assistant maliciously slandering the Party's leadership and state farms. During the writing of the book, he repeatedly urged the person helping him with copying to hurry up and prepare for immediate publication, saying: "It will be too late after October." In this book, he described state farms as a complete mess. He falsely claimed that state farms "did not show superiority" and that the farms asked the state for money every year, "forming a bottomless pit." He used the exaggeration of individual shortcomings to describe all the farms as very bad. He said that this socialist "economic foundation was shaken." He also wantonly slandered the employees of state farms, saying that technical personnel did not obey the leadership, "even a hundred calls were unanswered," and workers also "did not obey transfer." They were figures of "passive sabotage, theft, and robbery." He falsely claimed that the root cause of this chaotic situation was that the Party had "serious subjectivism (great subjectivism) in its guiding ideology," and that it was "blind" and "divorced from reality" in operating farms and formulating production plans, which resulted in being "politically divorced from the masses." The employees of the farms did not support the Party and had "centrifugal force." After attacking the Party in the book, he arrogantly said: Now is the "period of great social change. We must welcome and participate in this profound great change and promote its victorious transition." At the same time, he also put forward the proposition of welcoming "great social change." According to his proposition, we should learn from the farms in capitalist countries and run our country's farms into capitalist farms. He also put forward so-called twenty systems for running farms well in the book in the manner of an expert, in order to flaunt himself and attempt to come to power in the "great change." After he finished writing this book, he not only reported it to all the staff members of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation under the pretext of mobilizing increased production and conservation, but also reported it to the farm directors who came to Beijing for study and visits. He repeatedly urged the State Farm Pavilion of the National Agricultural Exhibition to hurry up and print it into a booklet and distribute it to all the farms across the country, attempting to stir up anti-Party waves everywhere.

Liu Peizhi did not let go of any opportunity that he thought could oppose the Party's leadership. When the Party organization of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation discussed the focus of the rectification campaign, he thought it was another opportunity. At the meeting, he strongly advocated and encouraged others to put the focus of the attack on the Mishan land reclamation work personally directed by Wang Zhen, the Minister of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation. Reclaiming wasteland in the Mishan area had been approved by the State Council long ago. Before the establishment of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, Comrade Wang Zhen was directing the land reclamation work there. This year, Mishan has reclaimed 140,000 hectares of wasteland, of which 70,000 hectares have been planted with spring wheat, which has yielded a bumper harvest and achieved great success. This year, the Party Group and the Ministry Affairs Meeting of the CCP Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation have decided to vigorously support the Mishan land reclamation work, but Liu Peizhi disobeyed in public and complied in private, and has repeatedly instructed people to collect the shortcomings of the Mishan land reclamation, and based on this, spread the atmosphere of Mishan land reclamation being destined to fail among the cadres, in order to attack Comrade Wang Zhen and thereby undermine the Party's leadership prestige.

Liu Peizhi knew that it would be difficult for him to achieve the goal of usurping leadership by opposing the Party alone. Therefore, during the period of blooming and contending, he took joint action with rightist elements. When the rightist elements in society had launched a major attack on the Party and put forward fallacies such as the establishment of a "political design institute," he actually offered the Party's leadership power in the ministry at a symposium of members of democratic parties in the ministry in the capacity of the Secretary of the CCP Committee of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation. He said: If the leadership decides alone, it is "inevitably subjective," and asked the democratic parties to jointly study the steps and methods of the rectification campaign. Under his encouragement, the rightist elements in the democratic parties became even more frantic. At a symposium, a rightist element asked the Communist Party to hand over the leadership of all work, and the democratic parties should participate in various tasks "from design to construction, from rehearsal to performance." After hearing this, Liu Peizhi not only expressed acceptance, but also further added that they should participate in "acceptance."

During the period of blooming and contending, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation also held various symposiums for intellectuals, youth, women, etc. Whenever these symposiums were presided over by Liu Peizhi, he encouraged rightist elements to attack the Party. Sometimes he felt that the rightist elements' attacks on Comrade Wang Zhen were not vicious enough, so he interjected to encourage them to speak "straightforwardly and directly."

Liu Peizhi was afraid that the rightist elements' firepower for attacking the Party was insufficient, so he gathered some people who hated the Party to participate in the symposium. Ma Zongyuan of the Cadre School of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation was not a senior intellectual, but because he was a bad element with blood debts in history, and he had been struggled against during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Liu invited him to participate in the symposium for senior intellectuals. This rightist element did not disappoint Liu Peizhi. At the symposium, he launched a frantic attack on the Party and falsely claimed that the cadre school was a mess.

Liu Peizhi also expressed joy at the attacks on the Party by rightist elements in society and other departments.

After the struggle against rightist elements began, he actually spread an atmosphere among the cadres that there seemed to be no rightist elements in the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation. After the rightist elements Leng Tiemin and She Yisheng, whom he encouraged, were exposed, he also admitted on the surface at the leadership group meeting that they were rightist elements, but behind the scenes, he used his identity as the Secretary of the Party Committee to cover up for them. He once told the Party branch secretary of Leng Tiemin's unit three times: Do not criticize Leng Tiemin as a rightist element.

Liu Peizhi's behind-the-scenes activities were finally exposed after the struggle against rightist elements in the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation deepened.

At the meeting, many people who exposed Liu Peizhi also pointed out that Liu Peizhi's anti-Party behavior was not accidental. During the Yan'an rectification movement in 1942, the Party conducted a review of him in order to understand the cadres, and he is still crying injustice; during the "Three Antis" movement, he was working in the Northeast, and he was once demoted due to poor leadership; during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he was criticized in a circular for his right-leaning tendencies. However, he did not learn lessons from these things and conscientiously transform himself. What he often kept in mind were issues of position and treatment. As a result, he finally degenerated to attacking the Party together with rightist elements.

After Liu Peizhi's anti-Party words and deeds were exposed, with the instructions of the CCP State Organs Party Committee, he has been removed from his position as Secretary of the Party Committee. When he learned of this notice and was initially exposed and criticized at the Party meeting, he not only did not admit his mistakes, but also prepared to "fight a lawsuit for ten years and work as a worker for ten years" to confront the Party. At the two-day meeting of all staff members, after people revealed a large number of facts, he still quibbled and did not honestly examine and confess.

The staff members of the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation were very indignant at Liu Peizhi's cunning attitude and prepared to continue holding meetings to further expose and criticize his anti-Party words and deeds.

　　刘培植培植的是什么？
　　资本主义的农业个人主义的野心
　  农垦部解剖这个堕落为右派的部长助理
    据新华社24日讯　农垦部22日和23日连续举行全体工作人员大会，揭露和批判反党分子刘培植。刘培植是农垦部部长助理、中共农垦部党委书记，他在大鸣大放中向党猖狂进攻，并且鼓励、支持部内右派分子向党攻击和诬蔑。
    据揭露，刘培植是个资产阶级个人主义野心家，他企图利用整风的机会，反对部的领导，阴谋夺取党对国营农场和农垦事业的领导权。
    刘培植的这种野心很早就有了，1953年他由东北调到农业部工作时，反党分子高岗曾经向他许愿，让他当副部长，但由于他的品质和能力都和副部长的职位不相称，只任命他当局长，因此，他对党非常不满。从此，他为了树立个人威信以便篡夺领导权，近几年来，一贯诋毁党和政府在举办国营农场和农垦事业上的成就；到处宣扬自己工作上的“伟大成绩”。1954年是他到农业部任职国营农场管理总局局长的第二年，在这一年的全国国营农场场长会议上，他为了抬高自己，不采纳集体意见，他向会议做报告中，一笔抹杀1948年到1952年的办场成绩，吹嘘从1953年即他担任国营农场管理总局局长这一年开始，农场才办好了，并且非常狂妄地把1953年誉为国营农场“大转变”的一年。他的这种狂妄行为，当时就受到了农业部部长廖鲁言的严格批评，但他并未改正错误，以后又写出两本书来为自己吹嘘。在1955年写成的“论我国过渡时期的国营农场”一书中，他为了标榜自己领导国营农场的成绩，还片面地夸大了国营农场的作用，把党领导的农业合作化运动大发展记在国营农场的账上，说农场“引导、教育”农民积极地参加了合作社。
    1956年4月农垦部成立了，农业部原国营农场管理总局的事业范围和人员全部划归农垦部。刘培植过去尽管一再为自己吹嘘，企图用抬高自己的办法往上爬，但是他的计划并未实现，这次仍然没有当上部长或者副部长，因此，他由对党不满变为仇视党。今年，大鸣大放开始后，便以为有机可乘，对党展开了疯狂的进攻。
    据揭露，他攻击党的手法是非常阴险的。为了反对党的领导攫取领导权，他和社会上的右派分子一样，首先企图否定他未负主要领导职务期间的国营农场和农垦事业的成绩。为了传播他这种恶毒的思想，他乘几位部长、副部长出差的时机，以部长助理身份写了一本对党的领导和国营农场恶意诬蔑的书，在写书期间，他一再督促帮他抄写的人要快赶，准备马上出版，并说：“过了10月就晚了”。在这本书中，他把国营农场说得一团漆黑。他诬蔑说：国营农场“没有显示出优越性来”，农场年年向国家要钱，“形成了无底洞”。他用夸大个别缺点的笔法把全部农场都描写得很糟，他说：这种社会主义的
  “经济基础动摇了”。他还对国营农场的职工大肆诬蔑，说技术人员都不服从领导，“甚至百呼不应”，工人也“不服从调动”，他们是“消极怠工，偷盗行抢”的人物。他诬蔑说，造成这种混乱状况的根本原因，是党在“指导思想上有严重的主观主义（大主观主义）”，在经营农场和制订生产计划上是“盲然的”，是“脱离实际”，结果便“在政治上脱离了群众”，农场的职工都不支持党，有“离心力”。他在书中对党攻击以后，便狂妄地说：现在正是“社会大变动时期，我们要迎接和参加这个深刻的大变动，促其胜利的渡过”，同时，他也提出了迎接“社会大变动”的主张，按照他的主张，就是向资本主义国家的农场学习，把我国的农场办成资本主义的农场。他还以内行的姿态，在书中提出所谓办好农场的制度二十条，以标榜自己，企图在“大变动”中上台。他这本书写完之后，不仅以假借动员增产节约为名，向农垦部的全体工作人员报告过，而且也向因学习和参观来京的农场场长报告过，并且一再督促全国农业展览会国营农场馆赶快印制成册，发到了全国各场，企图在各地煽起反党的风浪。
    刘培植是不放过一切在他看来是能够反对党的领导的机会的。整风开始农垦部的党组织讨论整风重点时，他认为又是一个可乘之机，在会议上他极力主张并且鼓动别人提出要把进攻重点放在由农垦部部长王震亲自指挥的密山开荒工作上。在密山地区开垦荒地是早经国务院批准的，在农垦部成立以前王震同志就在那里指挥垦荒工作。今年，密山已经开垦荒地十四万公顷，其中有七万公顷种了春小麦，已经获得丰收，成绩很大。今年，中共农垦部党组和部务会议都决定要大力支持密山的开荒工作，但刘培植阳奉阴违，一直不予支持，并且一再指示人搜集密山垦荒的缺点，据此在干部中散布密山开荒注定要失败的空气，以打击王震同志，借以破坏党的领导威信。
    刘培植知道，他单独反党是难于达到攫取领导权的目的的，因此，在鸣放期间和右派分子采取了共同行动。当社会上的右派分子已经向党大举进攻，提出成立“政治设计院”等谬论的时候，他在部内民主党派成员座谈会上，竟以中共农垦部党委书记的身份，把部内党的领导权奉送出去，他说：如果单由领导决定“难免主观”，要求各民主党派共同研究整风的步骤和方法。在他的鼓励下，民主党派中的右派分子更加疯狂了，在一次座谈会上，一个右派分子要共产党把一切工作的领导权都交出来，在各种工作上民主党派“从设计到施工，从彩排到表演”都要参加，刘培植听了之后不仅表示接受，还进一步补充说应该参加“验收”。
    农垦部在鸣放期间还召开了知识分子、青年、妇女等各种座谈会，这些座谈会凡是由刘培植主持时，他都鼓励右派分子向党进攻。有时他嫌右派分子对王震同志攻击的不够恶毒，便插话鼓动，要他们讲话“开门见山，直截了当”。
    刘培植唯恐右派分子对党进攻的火力不足，便搜罗一些仇视党的人参加座谈会。农垦部干部学校的马宗援并不是高级知识分子，但由于他是历史上有血债的坏分子，肃反中曾经斗争过他，刘就把他请来参加高级知识分子座谈会。这个右派分子果然没使刘培植失望，在座谈会上对党进行了疯狂的攻击，把干部学校诬蔑的一团糟。
    刘培植对社会上和其他部门的右派分子向党的进攻，也表示兴高采烈。
    反右派分子斗争开始以后，他竟在干部中散布一种好像农垦部并没有右派分子的空气。他所鼓励的右派分子冷铁民、佘翊盛被揭发后，在领导小组会议上他表面上也承认他们是右派分子，但背后又以党委书记的身份为他们打掩护，他曾三次告诉冷铁民所在单位的党支部书记：不要把冷铁民当作右派分子批判。
    刘培植的这些幕后活动，在农垦部反右派分子斗争深入后终于暴露出来了。
    在大会上许多揭露刘培植的人还指出：刘培植反党不是偶然的。1942年延安整风运动，党为了了解干部对他进行审查，他至今还喊冤屈；“三反”运动时，他正在东北工作，由于领导不力当时曾经受到撤职处分；肃反中又因有右倾情绪，受到通报批评。但是，他并没有从这些事情中吸取教训，认真改造自己，他经常念念不忘的是职位和待遇问题，结果，他终于堕落到和右派分子一道来向党进攻。
    刘培植的反党言行暴露以后，经中共国家机关党委指示已经撤销了他的党委书记职务，他在党内会议上获知这个通知并且初步受到揭露和批判时，他不仅不承认错误，还准备“打十年官司，当十年工人”来同党对抗。在这两天的全体工作人员大会上，人们揭出大量事实后，他仍然狡辩，不老老实实检查交代。
    农垦部的工作人员对刘培植的狡猾态度非常愤慨，准备继续举行会议进一步揭发和批判他的反党言行。
