Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 29th: Officers and soldiers from various organs, troops, and schools of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Northeast are supporting the people in flood control and rescue operations, and rushing to harvest disaster-stricken crops.

　　In order to safeguard the solidity of the Songhua River embankment and the safety of Harbin City, PLA officers and soldiers participated in flood control and rescue, braving the rain to repair the embankment together with the people of Harbin City.

An army of rush harvesters organized by PLA officers and soldiers arrived at Shuangshan, Hegang, Baoquanling, Keshan, Tongbei, Erlongshan, and Jiushan state-owned mechanical farms one after another to assist in rushing to harvest wheat and other crops. They will be able to complete the rush harvest in early September, saving more than 70,000 hectares of crops from loss.

　　东北驻军支援人民防汛
    新华社沈阳29日电　驻东北的中国人民解放军各机关、部队、学校中的军官和士兵支援人民防汛抢险，抢收受灾农作物。
    为了保卫松花江大堤的巩固、保卫哈尔滨市的安全，解放军官兵参加了防洪抢险，和哈尔滨市人民一道冒雨修堤。
    嫩江上游地区，由于雨量过大，国营机械农场的联合收割机不能下地收割。一支由解放军官兵组织的抢收大军，先后到达双山、鹤岗、保泉岭、克山、通北、二龙山和九山等国营机械农场，协助抢收小麦和其他作物。他们在9月上旬可以抢收完毕，将使七万公顷以上的农作物免受损失。
    8月中旬通化市浑江决口，附近驻军闻讯赶到，救出两千多被洪水包围的群众，堵住了江堤决口。
