Here is the Battlefield of the Past

On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, the reporter visited Nianzhuang, the "Huaihai Battlefield" of nine years ago. In November 1948, the great Huaihai Campaign began with the "Nianzhuang Battle." Huang Baitao's army corps, the elite division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, with 170,000 men, was completely annihilated here by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. During the war, the houses and trees of Nianzhuang were destroyed by the flames of war, and the residents scattered in all directions. However, once Nianzhuang was liberated, under the leadership of the Communist Party, it quickly recovered from the wounds of war. People returned and rebuilt their new homes. Today, no traces of the battlefield can be found here. More than 300 households are distributed in the newly planted forests since liberation, and more than 300 children who do not know the disasters of war are studying in newly built school buildings. A beautiful vision of rural construction is presented here. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Bihua (with pictures)

	In just nine years, the planted trees have grown tall and strong. In the sunlit woods, children are racing.

	The Communist Party leads the people of Nianzhuang to change the face of nature. This year, the Nianzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative plans to convert more than 300 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Last year, they had a bumper harvest of rice, with the highest yield reaching 488 jin. Here, the members are introducing water into the dry land. Early July is the time for planting late rice.

	The wheat harvest was bountiful this year, yielding more than 170 jin per mu.

	Grandma Sha, who is already sixty years old, is living a happy old age. The little grandson she is holding is three years old this year and is named "Pu Xuan" (Universal Suffrage), which was given to commemorate the first general election.

	A new primary school has been built on the southeast side of the village. The number of enrolled children has tripled compared to 1950. The old site of this school was a dilapidated temple, where the People's Liberation Army began its attack on Nianzhuang.

    这里是过去的战场
    “八一”建军节前夕，记者访问了九年前“淮海战场”上的碾庄。在1948年11月，伟大的淮海战役就是以“碾庄战斗”为序幕开始的，蒋介石匪帮的精锐师团——黄伯韬兵团的十七万人马在这里被中国人民解放军全部歼灭。战争中，碾庄的房屋、树木被毁于战火，居民也避散各地。可是，碾庄一经解放，在共产党领导下，就迅速恢复了战争的创伤，人们都回来了，重建新的家园。今天，这里已找不到战场的痕迹。三百多户人家分布在解放后新植的林业中，三百多个不知道战争灾难的儿童在新建的校舍中读书，这里呈现的是农村建设的美好远景。　新华社记者　许必华摄（附图片）
    不过九年时间，栽的树都长高大了。在充满朝晖的树林里，孩子们在赛跑。
    共产党领导碾庄人民改变自然面貌。今年，碾庄农业生产合作社又要把三百多亩旱地改为水田。去年，他们种的水稻获得丰收，最高产量达到四百八十八斤。这是社员们正在把水引入旱地，7月初，这里正是栽晚稻的时候。
    今年这里的小麦丰收了，一亩田就打了一百七十多斤。
    年已花甲的沙老太太，正在过着幸福的晚年。她抱着的小孙子，今年三周岁了，名叫“普选”，这是为了纪念第一次普选而起的。
    在村子的东南面，新建了一所小学，入学儿童比1950年增加了三倍。这个学校的旧址是一座破庙，人民解放军攻打碾庄就是在这里开始的。
