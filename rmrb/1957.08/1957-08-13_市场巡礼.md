    Market Inspection Tour
    Large-Scale Transport and Sale of Xinjiang Medicinal Materials to the Mainland
    Xinjiang Autonomous Region's medicinal material production has greatly developed in recent years. Not only has the output increased year by year, but many new varieties have also been discovered. For example, the output of fritillary bulbs this year will increase by more than 40% compared to last year, deer antlers by 25%, and cistanche by more than three times. Even codonopsis pilosula, which used to be imported into Xinjiang from inland, has been found in the region since last year. In addition to meeting the local supply, it will also be able to supply the whole country in large quantities this year.
    Due to the large output and many varieties of medicinal materials in Xinjiang, the demand from various places to Xinjiang is increasing day by day. From January to May this year alone, the supply of precious medicinal materials such as deer antlers, fritillary bulbs, safflower, deer velvet, codonopsis pilosula, and purple gromwell to more than 20 provinces and cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangdong reached 200 tons, an increase of more than double the amount transported to the mainland from January to May last year. It is estimated that the amount transported to the mainland this year will exceed 1,273 tons.
    Currently, the Xinjiang medicinal material management department has sent twice as many purchasing personnel as last year, distributed in the medicinal material producing areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, to organize and guide thousands of farmers and herdsmen in the intense digging of medicinal materials. In the future, many medicinal materials will not only be supplied to the whole country in large quantities, but will also be organized for export. The varieties for export this year include 30 tons of codonopsis pilosula, 20 tons of cistanche, 860 kilograms of deer antlers, and other varieties such as arctium fruit. (Zhong Zhi, Tian Lifu)
    Sichuan's Native Products with International Reputation
    Export Quantities and Varieties Rapidly Increasing
    Sichuan, known for its rich native products, provided a total value of more than 66.44 million yuan of native products for export in the first half of this year, an increase of nearly 20% compared to the same period last year. This batch of materials can earn the country 280,000 tons of steel or 420,000 tons of fertilizer.
    At present, Sichuan Province provides 307 kinds of export commodities, including native products, minerals, silk, tea, animal products, sundries, grain and oil, and other categories. These products have always been welcomed in the international market. This year, in addition to continuing to provide traditional export materials such as bristles, raw lacquer, gallnuts, and tung oil, the Sichuan Provincial Foreign Trade Department also plans to transport crystal, asbestos powder, accordions, handicrafts, etc., which have not been exported in the past, to Southeast Asia and Western Europe.
    In addition, some by-products that have not been fully utilized or discarded in the province, such as cotton stalk hemp, wild cotton skin, and pig hooves, will also be organized for export.

    Dalian Tiger Bone Medicated Wine Production Increases
    The state-owned Dalian Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory produces a famous and internationally renowned Ginseng and Velvet Antler Tiger Bone Wine. In the first half of the year, due to the opening up of sources for medicinal materials, more than 70,000 bottles were produced, an increase of nearly 40,000 bottles compared to the same period last year. Ginseng and Velvet Antler Tiger Bone Wine is welcomed by people all over the country and in international markets such as Myanmar, Malaysia, and Thailand.
    Ginseng and Velvet Antler Tiger Bone Wine is made from 46 kinds of precious medicinal materials unique to China, such as tiger bones, ginseng, deer velvet, and musk. Some of these rare medicinal materials have become difficult to collect due to the increased domestic demand in the first half of this year. However, in order to continue to supply Tiger Bone Wine to domestic and foreign markets, the factory specially sent purchasing personnel to the remote mountainous areas of the Xing'an Mountains, Changbai Mountains, and even Guangdong and Sichuan to open up sources for precious medicinal materials, collecting tiger bones, musk, deer velvet, and other precious medicinal materials from mountain village markets, temple fairs, and hunter's homes.
    Ginseng and Velvet Antler Tiger Bone Wine is a good medicine carefully prepared according to traditional Chinese medicine secret recipes, and is mainly used to treat muscle and bone pain, numbness of hands and feet, weakness of the waist and knees, deficiency of qi and blood, mental fatigue, cold distention in the stomach and abdomen, and rheumatic joint neuralgia. ·Xinhua News Agency·

    市场巡礼
    新疆药材大量运销内地
    新疆自治区几年来的药材生产有很大发展，产量不但逐年增加，新发现品种也很多。例如，贝母的产量今年比去年将增加40％多，鹿角增加25％，大芸增加三倍多，连历年需要由关内进疆的党参，自去年发现后，除能满足本区供应外，今年将能大量供应全国。
    由于新疆药材产量大，品种多，各地向新疆要货的日益增加。仅今年1月到5月，供应北京、天津、上海、广东等二十多个省市的鹿角、贝母、红花、鹿茸、党参、紫草等贵重药材就达二百吨，比去年1月到5月运销内地的数量增达一倍多。预计今年全年运销内地将超过一千二百七十三吨。
    目前，新疆药材经营部门派出了比去年多二倍的采购人员，分布在天山南北的药材产区，组织和指导数千农牧民紧张的挖掘药材。今后许多药材不仅能大量供应全国，并将组织出口，今年出口的品种计有党参三十吨，大芸二十吨，鹿角八百六十公斤，还有大力子等其他品种。　（忠直、田力夫）
    誉满国际的四川土特产
    出口数量和品种迅速增加
    以土特产丰富著称的四川，今年上半年提供出口的土特产品总值达六千六百四十多万元，比去年同期增加将近20％。这批物资可替国家换回钢材二十八万吨或肥田粉四十二万吨。
    目前，四川省提供出口商品有三百零七种、包括土产、矿产、丝绸、茶叶、畜产、杂品、粮油等类。这些产品一向在国际市场受到欢迎。今年，四川省对外贸易部门除了继续提供传统的出口物资如猪鬃、生漆、五倍子、桐油外，还准备将过去没有出口的水晶、石棉粉、手风琴、手工艺品等运销南洋和西欧。
    此外，一些省内尚未充分利用的或废弃的副产品，如棉杆麻、野棉皮、猪蹄甲等，也将组织出口。

    大连虎骨药酒增产
    地方国营大连化学制药厂生产的一种驰名中外的参茸虎骨酒，上半年由于开辟药材的源路，生产出七万多瓶，比去年同时期增加将近四万瓶。参茸虎骨酒在国内各地和缅甸、马来亚、泰国等国际市场上受到人们的欢迎。
    参茸虎骨酒是用虎骨、人参、鹿茸、麝香等四十六种我国特用的珍贵药材制成的。其中有些稀有药材，由于今年上半年国内需要量增加，采集源路发生困难。但是这个厂为了照常向国内外供应虎骨酒，专门派出采购员到兴安岭、长白山以至广东、四川等深山僻乡之间开辟珍贵药材的源路，从山村集市、庙会和猎人家中把虎骨、麝香、鹿茸等珍贵药材零零星星地搜集回来。
    参茸虎骨酒是根据我国传统的中医秘方精制的良药，主治筋骨疼痛、手足麻木、腰膝无力、气血虚弱、精神萎靡、胃腹寒胀和风湿关节神经痛。　·新华社·
