    The Rectification Leading Group of the China Democratic League Hubei Provincial Committee and Others Issue a Statement:
    Resolutely Support the Government in Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Riots

    (Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, 7th) The counter-revolutionary riot incident at Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School has aroused the anger of the people of Wuhan. The Rectification Leading Groups of the China Democratic League Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Committees, the China Democratic League Wuhan Teachers College Branch, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce have all issued statements on the matter, resolutely supporting the government in suppressing counter-revolutionary riots and thoroughly smashing the frenzied attacks of the right-wing elements.
    The Rectification Leading Group of the China Democratic League Hubei Provincial Committee issued a statement regarding the activities of historical counter-revolutionary element Yang Huanyao, saying: "According to our recent understanding, Yang Huanyao engaged in over 20 years of pseudo-judicial work before liberation and is a historical counter-revolutionary element with blood debts and popular grievances. He disguised himself as progressive to infiltrate our League. During the period of the Great Blooming and Free Airing of Views, under the direct instigation of the rightist ringleader Ma Zhemin, he frantically shouted: 'The CPPCC should become an organ with real power in the future.' As early as when Ma Zhemin controlled the leadership of our League's Hubei Provincial Committee, Yang Huanyao had already colluded with the counter-revolutionary elements Wang Jianguo and Yang Songtao of Hanyang County No. 1 Middle School, secretly engaging in illegal activities. He was not only Wang Jianguo's 'brilliant advisor,' but also incited students to make trouble in the streets and alleys after the students stirred up trouble. When the responsible comrades of the local Party and government of Hanyang persuaded the students with reason, and the disturbance was about to subside in the afternoon, he went to Wang Jianguo again and conspired with Hu Bin to make trouble in an organized manner, causing the riot incident to become even more fierce the next day. After the incident subsided, Yang Huanyao shielded the counter-revolutionary elements, saying, 'There are no American or Taiwanese special agents in the County Middle School incident, so it cannot be treated as a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy.' We support the government's correct measures regarding this incident and have telegraphed the League Central Committee to request permission to expel him from the League and have written to the government to give him legal sanctions."
    The old teachers who are recuperating at the summer vacation sanatorium also expressed unparalleled anger. Some teachers even held special forums, and everyone unanimously demanded that the government severely punish this group of conscienceless counter-revolutionary elements.

    民盟湖北省委整风领导小组等发表声明
    坚决拥护政府镇压反革命暴乱
    本报武汉7日电　汉阳县一中反革命暴乱事件引起了武汉人民的愤怒。民盟湖北省及武汉市委会整风领导小组、民盟武汉师专支部、民建武汉市委会和武汉市工商联等，都就此事发表声明，坚决拥护政府镇压反革命暴乱，彻底粉碎右派分子的猖狂进攻。
    民盟湖北省委整风领导小组就历史反革命分子杨焕尧的活动发表声明说：“据我们最近了解，杨焕尧在解放前干过二十多年的伪司法工作，是一个有血债有民愤的历史反革命分子。他伪装进步混入本盟。大鸣大放期间，他在右派头子马哲民直接唆使下，疯狂地喊叫：‘政协今后要变为实权机关。’早在马哲民把持我盟湖北省委领导权的时候，杨焕尧就同汉阳县一中的反革命分子王建国、杨松涛挂好了钩，暗中进行非法勾当。他不仅是王建国等的‘高明的军师’，在学生闹起来之后，他更在街头巷尾怂恿学生大闹。当汉阳地方党政负责同志以理说服学生，风潮即将平息的下午，他又去找王建国，并到胡斌家中密谋有组织地闹，致使第二天暴乱事件闹得更凶。事件平息后，杨焕尧替反革命分子打掩护，说‘县中事件没有美特、台特，不能当敌我矛盾处理’。我们拥护政府对这一事件的正确措施，已电请盟中央准予开除他的盟籍，并函请政府给以法律制裁。”
    正在暑期老教师休养站休养的老教师们也表示了无比的愤怒。有些教师还专门开了座谈会，大家一致要求政府严惩这帮丧尽天良的反革命分子。
