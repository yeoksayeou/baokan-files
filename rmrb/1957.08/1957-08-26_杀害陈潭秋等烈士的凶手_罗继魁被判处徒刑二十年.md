　　Luo Jikui Sentenced to Twenty Years in Prison
    (Reported by this newspaper) Luo Jikui, another murderer of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee member Chen Tanqiu and other martyrs, was recently sentenced to twenty years imprisonment by the Liaoning Provincial Higher People's Court. Luo Jikui was an accomplice of the counter-revolutionary element Lu Binglin (originally named Lu Qingfu, who was sentenced by the Lanzhou Municipal People's Court on June 28th) in the murder of Chen Tanqiu and other martyrs. In the autumn of 1943, while Luo Jikui was serving as a captain and prison warden, under the command of special agents and the head of the puppet Public Security Administration, Li Yingqi, he and prison official Lu Binglin, and other executioners, strangled Chen Tanqiu, and our party's senior cadres Mao Zemin and Lin Jilu. From 1941 to the end of 1943, Luo Jikui participated in the murder of more than 250 Communist Party members and innocent people. This counter-revolutionary element, stained with blood debts, should have been suppressed according to law, but considering that he has shown signs of confessing his crimes, he was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment.

　  杀害陈潭秋等烈士的凶手
　　罗继魁被判处徒刑二十年
    本报讯　杀害中共中央委员陈潭秋等烈士的另一凶手罗继魁，已于最近被辽宁省高级人民法院判处有期徒刑二十年。罗继魁是与反革命分子芦秉林（原名芦庆福，已于6月28日经兰州市人民法院判决）共同杀害陈潭秋等烈士的凶手。在1943年秋，罗继魁任上尉监狱长期间，在特务分子、伪公安管理处长李英奇等的指挥下，和监狱官芦秉林等刽子手，将陈潭秋和我党高级干部毛泽民、林基路同志勒死。罗继魁从1941年到1943年末，曾先后参与杀害共产党员和无辜群众二百五十多人。这个血债累累的反革命分子本应依法镇压，但考虑他已有认罪表现，故判有期徒刑二十年。
