Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd. The Jiangsu Provincial Finance and Trade organs and state-owned companies, in the anti-Rightist struggle, have won over intermediate elements, and the fighting ranks are constantly expanding. At present, the number of active elements in various departments, bureaus, offices, banks, and societies has increased from about 30% in the early stage of the struggle to 60% to 70%.

At the beginning of the anti-Rightist struggle, some people had ideological concerns. Some were once won over by Rightists using double-dealing tactics, some had said wrong things during the blooming and contending period, some had good feelings for Rightists on weekdays, and some did not sufficiently recognize the harmfulness of the Rightists' reactionary words and deeds. Therefore, they were not very active in the struggle.

In response to the above situation, the leading groups of various units generally made reports on overcoming sentimentalism and explained that there was an essential difference between wrong words and deeds and the reactionary words and deeds of the Rightists, helping them draw a line between themselves and the Rightists. They also improved their class consciousness through seminars or individual talks. After a series of efforts, the vast majority of these people eliminated their ideological concerns, took the initiative to examine themselves, and actively engaged in the struggle. Some people in the Petroleum Company, the People's Bank, and other units who were originally not concerned about the struggle actively participated in the battle after recognizing the ugly faces of the Rightists.

With the intermediate elements turning to the left, the fighting forces on various battlefields have become more substantial, the Rightists have become increasingly isolated, and most Rightists have already bowed their heads in admission of guilt.

    在反右派斗争中争取了中间分子
    江苏财政贸易机关的积极分子由百分之三十增至百分之七十
    新华社南京3日电　江苏省省级财政贸易机关和国营公司在反右派斗争中，争取了中间分子，战斗队伍正在不断扩大。目前各部、厅、局、行、社积极分子已由斗争初期的30％左右增加到60％到70％。
    反右派斗争开始时，一部分人思想有顾虑，其中有的一度被右派分子用两面派手法拉拢过去，有的在大鸣大放中讲过错话，平日和右派分子感情很好，有的对右派分子反动言行危害性认识不足；因此，他们在斗争中表现很不积极。
    针对上述情况，各单位领导小组普遍作了克服温情主义的报告，并且说明错误言行和右派分子的反动言行有本质区别，帮助他们划清同右派的界限。还通过座谈会或个别谈话，提高他们阶级觉悟。经过一系列工作，这一部分人中绝大多数消除了思想顾虑，主动检讨自己，积极投入斗争。石油公司、人民银行等单位一些原来不关心斗争的人，在认清右派分子丑恶面貌后，都积极参加战斗。
    中间分子向左转，各个战场的斗争力量更加充实，右派分子越来越显得孤立，大多数右派分子已经低头认罪。
