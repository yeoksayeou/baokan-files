This newspaper, Zhengzhou, 16th -- The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a plenary session in the first half of August. In accordance with the Central Committee's instruction to conduct a large-scale socialist education for the entire rural population and the spirit of the National Grain Conference, the meeting launched a relatively profound criticism and self-criticism of the current right-wing thinking within the Party. It called on everyone to maintain and develop a strong revolutionary will and vigorous spirit, oppose ideological rigidity, eliminate bourgeois ideology in their minds during this political and ideological socialist revolution, and earnestly improve their leadership style.

The meeting, in analyzing the province's grain situation, pointed out that although there have been many difficulties in Henan's grain issue in recent years, great achievements have also been made: guaranteeing the needs of urban and rural people, supporting the country's industrial construction, and stabilizing prices. This year, due to disasters in both summer and autumn farmland, 20 million mu of farmland were affected by the summer disaster, affecting over 9.7 million people, and the autumn disaster area reached 30.9 million mu, of which about 10 million mu of autumn seedlings were mostly submerged and died, with over 13 million victims basically having no harvest. In this situation, what should be done? Should we reach out to the state for assistance, or should we actively find ways to overcome the difficulties? The meeting believed that we must take the latter path, mobilizing peasants to engage in production for self-salvation and striving for more purchases and less sales in non-disaster areas. The guiding ideology of the entire Party must be unified on the basis of conscientiously implementing the Central Committee's "using abundance to compensate for deficiencies" policy for grain work.

In the past, the province had somewhat relaxed grain supply, leading to consumption levels exceeding the pace of production development. For example, last year's grain output failed to increase compared to the previous year due to disasters, but consumption increased by more than 2 billion jin. Due to insufficient publicity and education on grain issues for cadres and the masses, right-wing ideas grew among many comrades within the Party. They one-sidedly emphasized the immediate interests of the masses, had unclear understanding of the improvement of the lives of the vast majority of peasants, and some even echoed the "suffering" cries of some wealthy middle peasants, demanding fewer purchases and more sales, and higher grain retention standards. Many agricultural cooperative cadres resisted the state's policy of unified purchase and sale, concealing production and distributing it privately. According to statistics from 34 agricultural cooperatives in Lingbao, the actual output was 6.05 million jin of grain, but only 5.65 million jin were reported; Xuezishan Cooperative in Nanliu Township, Yiyang County, even organized a production concealment committee, collectively concealing production. In addition, some small merchants and farmers engaged in speculative buying and selling and privately set up grain shops. In response to this situation, the meeting believed that it was necessary to immediately overcome right-wing thinking and localism within the Party through rectification and socialist education. The capitalist and individualistic ideas among farmers should be debated using methods such as full reasoning, accounting, and comparison. Speculative activities in grain must be strictly banned. Secondly, it is necessary to seize the opportunity and do everything possible to improve current agricultural production. Non-disaster areas should do a good job in farmland management, increase topdressing fertilizer, hoe and weed more, eliminate weeds and pests, and prevent new disasters. Disaster areas should vigorously launch production for self-salvation, draining water and rushing to plant, trying to replant late autumn vegetables, etc., and strive to harvest 920 million jin (converted to grain) more of autumn grain crops, sweet potatoes, and vegetables. The province is determined to guarantee the completion of the summer grain procurement task of 1.8 billion jin, launch a grain conservation movement, call on everyone to save grain, every household to store dried vegetables, and find alternative foods from various sources. The standard for farmers' grain retention will not be raised; staff of state organs, industrial and mining workers, and urban residents over the age of ten must save more than one jin, one jin, or half a jin of grain per person per month.

    保持坚强革命意志  发扬蓬勃革命朝气
    河南省委批评右倾思想
    在受灾减产的情况下要依靠本省的力量征服困难
    本报郑州16日电  中共河南省委于8月上半月召开了全体委员会议，会议根据党中央关于向全体农村人口进行一次大规模的社会主义教育指示，及全国粮食会议的精神对目前党内的右倾思想展开了比较深刻的批评与自我批评，号召大家保持和发扬坚强的革命意志和蓬勃的朝气，反对思想僵化，在这次政治上思想上的社会主义革命中清除头脑中的资产阶级思想，切实改进领导作风。
    会议在分析全省粮食局势时指出，几年以来，河南省粮食问题上虽然有较多的困难，但是也做出了很大的成绩：保证了城乡人民的需要，支援了国家的工业建设，稳定了物价。今年由于夏、秋两季农田遭受灾害，夏季受灾农田二千万亩，灾民九百七十多万，秋季受灾面积有三千零九十万亩，其中约一千多万亩秋苗大部淹死，基本没有收成的灾民达一千三百多万。在这种情况下怎么办？是伸手向国家要呢，还是主动想办法来征服困难？会议认为必须走后一条道路，发动农民生产自救，在非灾区争取多购少销。全党的指导思想必须在认真贯彻执行中央对于粮食工作的“以丰补歉”的方针的基础上统一起来。
    过去一个时期，全省在粮食供应上有些偏松，以致消费水平超过了生产发展的速度。例如，去年粮食产量因灾而未能比上一年度增加，但在消费上却增多了二十多亿斤。由于对于干部和群众在粮食问题的宣传教育不够，以致影响到党内不少同志滋长了右倾思想，他们片面强调群众眼前利益，对绝大多数农民生活的改善认识不清，部分人还随着一些富裕中农叫“苦”，要求少购多销，提高留粮标准。不少农业社干部抵触国家统购统销政策，瞒产私分。据灵宝三十四个农业社统计，实产六百零五万斤粮食，仅上报五百六十五万斤；伊阳县南刘乡薛子山社竟组织了瞒产委员会，集体瞒产。此外有部分小商贩和农民，套购贩运私设粮行。针对这种情况，会议认为必须立即通过整风和社会主义教育来克服党内的右倾思想和本位主义思想，对农民中的资本主义和个人主义思想，要以充分说理、算账、对比等方法展开辩论。对粮食投机活动要严格取缔。其次，必须抓紧时机，千方百计地搞好当前农业生产。非灾区要作好农田管理，增施追肥，多铲多锄，消灭草荒和虫害，防止新的灾荒。灾区要大力展开生产自救，排水抢种，尽量补种晚秋蔬菜等，争取秋季粮食作物、红薯、蔬菜三项多收获九亿二千万斤（折粮）。全省坚决保证完成夏季征购粮食十八亿斤的任务，展开节约粮食运动，号召人人节约粮食，户户储集干菜，多方找代食品。农民粮食留量标准不予提高；国家机关工作人员、工矿职工、城市十岁以上居民每人每月都要节约粮食一斤多、一斤或半斤。
