    Everyone Must Conserve Grain

    The Henan Daily published an editorial entitled "Everyone Must Conserve Grain," excerpts of which are as follows:

    Due to the weakness of political and ideological education in rural areas, the situation of grain production and consumption, and the reasons why grain consumption cannot be improved quickly, have not been clearly explained to the farmers, so they do not understand the importance of conserving grain. As a result, many farmers have the idea of keeping more for themselves to eat and selling less to the state. In addition, some cadres have one-sided views and have not considered the problem of food for the six hundred million people and the long-term interests of the farmers. In the distribution and control of grain, they tend to cater to the current needs of local farmers. Therefore, this year's summer grain unified purchase work, except for individual areas, is generally progressing very slowly. In urban grain sales, many government agencies, schools, organizations, and industries still have some phenomena of falsely reporting and claiming, and wasting grain. Therefore, it is a very glorious and important task for the people of the entire province to seize the current opportunity, in accordance with the policy stipulations, to save all the grain that can be saved in order to support socialist construction and support the compatriots in the disaster areas.

    Judging from the current rate of grain production development, the people of the whole province can save on grain consumption. If each person can save half a catty or one catty of grain per month, the province can save 25 million catties or 50 million catties in one month, and 300 million catties or 600 million catties in one year, which can feed more than one million disaster victims for a year. And saving half a catty to one catty of grain per month per person is only half an ounce to one ounce per day on average; just eat a few less mouthfuls per meal.

    Whether it is the state or the people, whether it is urban or rural, whether it is a bumper harvest area or a disaster area, we should regard saving grain as a regular matter. The saving of grain we are talking about does not only refer to the kind of behavior that squanders grain at will. Supplying grain that should not be supplied, or supplying more than the state-stipulated supply quota, and agricultural cooperatives and farmers who have surplus grain are unwilling to hand over the grain to the state to complete the requisition task, wanting to keep it for themselves to eat more, these are also a waste.

    Saving grain in cities is not only an important economic measure to solve the shortage of grain production and is related to the lives of every resident, but also has great political significance in strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and close urban-rural relations. It is hoped that all government agencies, organizations, factories, and the broad masses will seize the current peak season for the production of vegetables and substitutes, actively collect, store, and eat various substitutes, rationally arrange grain use, and ensure the realization of the grain saving plan.

    To save grain in rural areas, first of all, farmers are required to strictly obey the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. What should be sold must be sold to the state, and what should not be bought must resolutely not be supplied by the state, in order to help the state balance the grain revenue and expenditure plan. The various grain retention standards set by agricultural cooperatives when distributing grain must all implement the spirit of saving grain. Seeds should be retained only to the extent that they are sufficient, and rations and feed must not exceed the state-stipulated standards. In the work of assessment and sales, farmers should be educated to eat their own grain first, and then the state's, and to supply it whenever there is a shortage, in order to save the state's grain.

### 人人都要节约粮食

    人人都要节约粮食
    河南日报以“人人都要节约粮食”为题发表社论，摘要如下：
    由于农村政治思想教育工作薄弱，没有把粮食生产和消费的情况和粮食消费不能很快改善的原因和道理，明白地告诉农民，使他们知道节约粮食的重要，因而，不少农民存在多留多吃少卖的思想；加上部分干部有片面观点，没有从六亿人民和农民的长远利益来考虑大家的吃饭问题，在粮食分配和掌握上偏于照顾本地农民当前的需要。因此，今年夏季粮食统购工作，除个别地区外，一般进展的很缓慢。在城市粮食销售上，不少机关、学校、团体以及行业用粮，还存在一些虚报冒领，浪费粮食的现象。因此，在当前抓紧时机，按照政策规定，节约一切可以节约的粮食，以支援社会主义建设，支援灾区同胞，是全省人民非常光荣和重要的任务。
    从目前粮食生产发展的速度来看，全省人民粮食消费是可以节约的。如果每人每月能节约半斤或一斤粮食，全省一个月就可节约二千五百万斤或五千万斤，一年就可节约三亿斤或六亿斤，可供百万以上灾民食用一年。而每人每月节约半斤至一斤粮食，平均到每天不过半两至一两，每顿饭少吃几口就行了。
    不论是国家和人民，不论城市或农村，不论是丰收地区和灾区，都应该把节约粮食看成是经常性的事情。我们所说的节约用粮，不仅仅指的是那种任意挥霍粮食的行为说的。把不应该供应的粮食供应出去，或者是缺少供多超过国家规定的供应指标，有多余粮食的农业社和农民，不愿意把粮食交售给国家完成征购任务，想留着自己多吃，这些，同样是一种浪费。
    城市节约粮食，不仅是解决粮食生产不足和关系到每个居民生活问题的一项重要经济措施，而且具有加强工农联盟，密切城乡关系的重大的政治意义。希望各机关、团体、工厂和广大的群众要抓紧当前蔬菜和代食品的生产旺季，积极采集、储备和食用各种代食品，合理安排用粮，保证节约粮食计划的实现。
    在农村节约粮食，首先要求农民严格服从国家的粮食统购统销政策，该卖的一定卖给国家，不该买的坚决不要国家供应，以便帮助国家平衡粮食收支计划。农业社在分配粮食时所定的各种留粮标准，都要贯彻节约用粮的精神，种籽以留足为限，口粮和饲料一定不能超过国家规定标准。在评销工作上，要教育农民先吃自己的，后吃国家的，啥时缺啥时供应，以节约国家粮食。
