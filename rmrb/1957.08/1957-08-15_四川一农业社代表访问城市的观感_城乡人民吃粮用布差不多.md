Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, August 14th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Liu Zongtang and Yu Quanyu report: Three cooperative member representatives from the Liulin Agricultural Cooperative in Langshan Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan, who visited the city, relayed that the city residents do not eat more grain and pork than farmers, and the government's supply of oil and cloth coupons is also very similar.

In the past, members of the Liulin Cooperative generally had the misconception that city residents ate much more grain and pork, used more cooking oil, and wore more cloth than farmers. During the recent socialist debate, many cooperative members raised opinions about this. The Langshan Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party suggested that the cooperative send representatives to visit Jiangjin County. The Liulin Cooperative accepted this suggestion, and in early August, selected three representative cooperative members to go to the city to learn about their suspected problems through relatives and friends.

One of the representatives, Zeng Dehua, is an old middle peasant. He visited his cousin, Yang Zhengjiang, in the city. Yang Zhengjiang is a repair worker in a bicycle repair cooperative, and his family of five eats an average of seventeen catties of rice per person per month, which translates to an average of two hundred and eighty-eight catties of paddy per person per year. Zeng Dehua calculated that the grain of Yang Zhengjiang's family, just counting fine grains, was about the same as his own family, and even lower if you counted coarse grains. Zeng Dehua's family of six distributed a total of 1,820 catties of paddy last year, averaging 303 catties per person. In addition, they were allocated 583 catties of wheat, corn, broad beans, etc., and 2,500 catties of sweet potatoes, not including the grain produced by the private plots.

Qiu Shunqing, a fifty-eight-year-old newly-emerged middle peasant, visited three families in the city this time, including Yang Zicheng who pulls a cart, Old Man Li who sells Tangyuan (sweet rice balls), and a barber named Yang. According to the information they provided, they eat less than one catty of rice per person per day, but Qiu Shunqing's family eats more than one catty of rice per person per day on average.

Another cooperative member representative, poor peasant Gu Yulian, is the cooperative's women's committee member. As a result of her visit to a relative's home in the city, she did not find that city residents had excessively high grain rations.

The three cooperative member representatives also investigated the situation of city residents' meat consumption, oil consumption, and clothing. The materials they obtained were the same. The city supplies one and a half catties of pork per person per month, and the countryside supplies one catty per person per month. It seems like a little less, but the government stipulates that farmers can keep ten catties of meat for every fat pig they sell, and the increase in pork supplied to farmers during the Spring Festival is more than in the city, so the amount of pork eaten by farmers each year is definitely not less than in the city. In terms of oil consumption and clothing, the city is higher than the countryside. City residents with electric lights get three taels of kerosene per person per month, and those without electric lights get seven taels, while the countryside gets one tael per person per month. City residents get 2.6 zhang of cloth coupons per year, and farmers get 2.3 zhang. The difference is limited. They saw that the economic conditions in the city were different, and many jobs had to be done at night, so these differences in material supply were reasonable.

After these three representatives returned from their visit, their thinking changed. Zeng Dehua used to be one of those with more opinions on urban-rural relations. This time, he said to the people in the courtyard: Just shouting about how the city is doing, can't stand the calculation. When you calculate, the city doesn't eat much grain, and we don't eat little. When he described the visit in the group meeting, he calculated everything clearly, and the cooperative members listened and nodded, all convinced.

### 四川一农业社代表访问城市的观感  城乡人民吃粮用布差不多

    四川一农业社代表访问城市的观感
    城乡人民吃粮用布差不多
    据新华社成都14日电　新华社记者刘宗棠、喻权域报道：四川江津县琅山乡柳林农业社派到城市访问的三个社员代表回来传达说：城市居民吃的粮食和猪肉并不比农民多，政府供给的油和布票相差也很小。
    柳林社社员过去普遍有一种错觉，以为城市居民吃的粮食和猪肉，食用的油和穿的布料都比农民多得多。这次开展社会主义大辩论时，不少社员对此提出意见。中共琅山乡支部建议社里派代表到江津县城访问。柳林社接受了这个意见，8月上旬选派了三个有代表性的社员到城里去，通过亲戚朋友的关系了解他们怀疑的问题。
    代表之一曾德华，是老中农，他在城里访问了他的表兄杨正江。杨正江是自行车修理合作社修理工人，全家大小五口，平均每人每月吃大米十七斤，折成稻谷按年计算，每人平均二百八十八斤。曾德华计算结果，杨正江一家的粮食，光算细粮和自己家庭差不多，如果算上粗粮还要低于自己。曾德华全家大小六口人，去年共分稻谷一千八百二十斤，平均每人三百零三斤，另外又分有小麦、玉米、葫豆等五百八十三斤，甘薯二千五百斤，自留地生产的粮食还不在内。
    五十八岁的新上中农丘顺清，这次在城里访问了三家人，有拉架架车的杨自成，卖汤元的李老汉和一个姓杨的理发工人。从他们提供的情况计算，每人平均每天吃米不到一斤，但丘顺清一家平均每人每天要吃一斤多米。
    另一个社员代表贫农古玉莲，是社里妇女委员，她到城里一个亲戚家里访问的结果，也没有发现城市居民吃粮过高的待遇。
    这三位社员代表还调查了城里居民吃肉、用油和穿布的情况，他们得到的材料是相同的。城市每人每月供应猪肉一斤半，农村每人每月一斤，看来像是少了一些，但政府规定农民每卖一头肥猪可留肉十斤，再加春节农民增加供应的猪肉比城市多，农民每年所吃猪肉的数量决不比城市少。用油和穿布方面，城市比农村是高，城市居民有电灯的每人每月三两煤油，无电灯的七两，农村每人每月一两；城市每人每年布票二丈六尺，农民二丈三尺。相差都有限。他们看到城市经济条件不同，许多工作要在晚上做，这些物资供应的差别是合理的。
    这三位代表访问回来后，思想改变了。曾德华过去是对城乡关系意见较多的一个，这次他对同院的人说：光是喊叫城市如何如何，经不得算，算起来城市吃粮不算多，我们吃的也不算少。他在小组会上叙述访问的情况时，每件事都算得清清楚楚，社员们听的直点头，个个心服口服。
