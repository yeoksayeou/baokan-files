　　Two Generations
　　Zhiting
    In the first two years after liberation, people often liked to think and talk about the past. Take Liu Guangjin for example: when his wife made him some good food, he would think of the years when he ate "mixed noodles"; when she sewed him a new piece of clothing, he would think of the years when his father's generation of old workers used cement bag paper as clothing. When the class won the red flag in the labor competition, and all the workers in the class went to visit the Summer Palace, he would think of the years when he worked overtime for forty consecutive hours. Every month when he received his monthly salary and the "accident-free bonus" for the previous month, and deposited a stack of Renminbi into the savings bank, he would think of the years when he and his father worked desperately hard, only to owe the factory money at the end of the month. When he saw retired old workers enjoying labor insurance benefits, he would think of his father's generation of old workers, who worked for the capitalists their entire lives, exhausted their sweat, and were kicked out of the factory when they were old, without even enough money left for a coffin. When he was elected as a labor model and a representative of the Beijing People's Congress, and he sat with the responsible comrades of the state to discuss production, construction, and other major issues, he would think of the years when worker brothers and sisters who were ill were thrown into cement pools or gullies; and the years when Kuomintang officials came to the factory to inspect and drove the workers into the underground ash caves...
    Later, Liu Guangjin's work became increasingly busy, and he bore more and more responsibility. In the midst of intense work and labor, the times when he recalled and talked about the past gradually decreased. However, in the past two or three months, his old habits seemed to have returned. The reason is simple: since the newspapers exposed the bourgeoisie right-wingers' "the present is not as good as the past," "don't let the Communist Party lead," "today's society is a pitch-black mess"... some shameless slanders, anyone with a sense of justice could not help but be indignant, could not help but speak out, could not help but fight back. Liu Guangjin, with ironclad facts, his own experience, and the experience of thousands upon thousands of working people, refuted the black-hearted and malicious nonsense of those right-wing elements in some symposiums, debates... and at the Capital People's Congress.
    In November 1937, when Guangjin was only twelve years old, he went to work as a temporary worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant. His father also worked in the power plant, firing the low-pressure furnace. In principle, it was a good thing for father and son to work in the same factory, an ideal thing.
    They were building a high-pressure furnace building, and the twelve-year-old child—Guangjin—was doing the job of carrying water, climbing step by step along the wooden planks of the inclined bridge. You can imagine how difficult this was! At that time, did the capitalists care whether your body could handle it? Did they care that you were a child laborer? Did they appropriately assign you work that you could handle?...
    Guangjin had to grit his teeth and do it. His shoulders were swollen high. They were worn and torn, forming scabs of blood, like oxen drawing carts whose shoulders had been worn down by the yoke (worn and broken backs), and he still had to work the same way. Guangjin worked like this for ten months, and when they no longer needed him, they kicked him out. He asked people to find him odd jobs elsewhere, and spent two years like this, drifting in the wind and rain. When the power plant needed someone to push furnace ash, he returned to the power plant again.
    What kind of job was pushing furnace ash? Many old workers in the power plant had done this job, and anyone who mentioned it would "turn pale at the mention of a tiger"! Under the boilers of several furnaces, there was a dark cave, the place where the furnace ash fell. Good coal went into the furnace, but it didn't burn thoroughly, and some of it rolled around and fell down. The furnace ash piled up high, almost reaching the floor of the boiler room. The people who carried the ash out would dig a path from the aisle, crawl in, quickly grab a few shovels, and run out while the furnace ash was still "whooshing" with flames more than a meter high. People were baked by the fire every day, and their bodies "sizzled" with oil; their clothes often caught fire, burning a hole here, and a large patch there. Their hair was baked and curled up, as if it had been permed. The four-centimeter thick hemp rope of the ash cart would break with a pull after being baked. People would run out of the ash tunnel, and some would faint after a few steps. Because the flames were higher than people, the workers driving the cart couldn't see the road ahead, and the smoke made it impossible to open their eyes. Such heavy work had to be done by young and strong people. They had to eat properly to withstand it. As the saying goes, "Man is iron, food is steel," but what were they eating? Soybean cake flour, mixed noodles. Liu Guangjin, at the age of fourteen or fifteen, worked like this for two or three years before being transferred to fire the low-pressure furnace.
    Father and son received eighteen catties of soybean cake flour a week, not enough to eat. In order to support the family and get a little more soybean cake flour, they ended up owing the factory more than one hundred yuan at the end of the month. There was no other way, they worked overtime. Guangjin's father developed lung disease from exhaustion, and Guangjin worked as two people, going to work during the day, working for his father for the first half of the night, and also working overtime. He often didn't leave the boiler room for forty hours. He didn't have any strength! He had to throw two shovels of coal and then hug his stomach and lie down for a while. He carried a few small soybean cakes, smaller than sesame cakes, and had to eat them according to a plan.
    His father's lung disease became more and more serious. Not wanting to burden his children, he secretly took a hemp rope to the Yongding River beach forest to hang himself. Fortunately, he was rescued by someone else. Father and son met and cried bitterly. Guangjin advised his father, "Suffering and starving, our family is together, you must not commit suicide! Take care of your illness and recuperate. You can borrow and buy on credit as much as you want. Spend it if you can borrow it; eat it if you can buy it on credit. I won't die, I'll pay off the debts for you anyway; if I can't pay them off in my lifetime, my children will continue to pay them off!"
    His father couldn't speak, his heart aching. His lung disease became more and more serious, and he died anyway. When he died, he borrowed more than one hundred yuan to buy a coffin and pay off debts. This is how the old workers who worked in the factory their entire lives in that era, exhausted their sweat and drained their strength, ended up!
    In December 1948, Shijingshan was liberated. A brand new era unfolded before Liu Guangjin and all the workers. The fate of the old workers of his father's generation would never be repeated. Under the leadership of the Party, Guangjin made many contributions that were unimaginable in the old era; the people also gave Guangjin a high honor—Labor Model and Representative of the Beijing People's Congress.
    Do these two different eras of workers' fates not explain the difference between the old and new societies? If the right-wing elements were not black-hearted, blind, and deliberately reversing right and wrong, why would they be so glib?

　　芷汀
    刚解放的那二年，人们常爱想到和谈起过去的事。比如刘光金吧：当他的爱人给他做些好饭菜的时候，他就想起过去吃“混合面”的年月；给他缝件新衣服的时候，他想起父亲那一代老工人拿洋灰袋子纸当衣穿的年月。班上在劳动竞赛中得了优胜红旗，全班工友去逛颐和园的时候，他想起一连四十小时打加班的年月。每当月初发下本月的工资和上月的“无事故奖金”，把一叠人民币存到储蓄所的时候，他想起和父亲两人拚死拚活的苦干，到月终倒欠工厂钱的年月。当他看到退休的老工人们享受到劳保待遇的时候，他想起父亲那一代的老工人，给资本家干了一辈子，汗流尽了，人熬干了，到老来被一脚踢出工厂，连个装身子的棺材钱也没剩下的年月。他当选劳动模范、北京市人民代表，他和国家负责同志们坐在一起开会研究生产、建设……等重大问题的时候，他想起从前工人弟兄们患病，带着气被扔进洋灰池子或山沟里的年月；想起国民党大员来厂参观把工人们轰进地下炉灰洞里去的年月……
    后来，刘光金的工作越发忙了，担负的责任越来越大。在紧张的工作、劳动中，回忆和谈起过去的时候就渐渐少了。但是，近两三个月以来，他的老习惯似乎又恢复起来。原因很简单，自从报纸上揭露了资产阶级右派分子的“今不如昔”“不要共产党来领导”“今天的社会漆黑一团”……一些无耻谰言以后，使得任何有正义感的人不能不激愤，不能不发言，不能不反击了。刘光金更以铁的事实，自身的经历，也是千千万万劳动人民的经历，在一些座谈会、辩论会……和首都人民代表大会上驳斥着那些右派分子黑心的恶毒的胡说八道。
    1937年11月间，光金才十二周岁的时候，就到石景山发电厂做临时工了。他的父亲也在发电厂低压炉烧火。按说，爷儿俩在一个工厂工作是件好事，合乎理想的事了。
    正在修高压炉大楼，十二岁的孩子——光金，做挑水的活计，沿着木板搭的斜桥一步一步攀登高楼。你想，这是多不容易的事！那时候，资本家还管你的身体吃的消吃不消吗？照顾你是童工吗？适当的分配你力能胜任的工作吗？……
    光金这孩子只得咬着牙干。肩膀压的肿了老高。磨破了，淀成血疙渣，像驾车的牲口叫鞍子打了肩（磨破了脊背）一样，还得照样干活。光金这样干了十个月，当人家用不着他的时候，便一脚踢开，光金失业了。托人在别处找点零活儿干，就这样风雨飘摇地过了二年，发电厂找人推炉灰，他就又回到发电厂。
    推炉灰是怎么个活碴呢？在电厂的老工友干过这个事的不少，谁提起来也会“谈虎色变”的！几盘锅炉下面的地下，是一层黑洞洞，是锅炉落灰的地方。好煤进炉，也不烧透，有的进炉打一个滚儿就往下放。炉灰积垒老高，快顶到锅炉房的地板了。向外运灰的人，从甬道里掏一条路，钻进去，赶紧抢几锹，炉灰还“呼呼”地冒着一人多高的火苗子就往外跑。人天天叫火烤着，烤的身上“滋滋”地冒油；衣服经常着火，这里烧一个洞、那里烧一大片。头发烤的卷曲了，像烫的一样。拉灰车的四分粗的麻绳烤的一扯就断。人跑出炉灰道，有的走几步就晕倒了。因为火苗比人高，驾车把的工人看不见前进的路，烟熏的睁不开眼睛。这样繁重的活计必须年轻力壮的人来干。必须吃得合适才能顶住。俗语说：“人是铁，饭是钢”，可是，他们吃的是什么？豆饼面，混合面。十四、五岁的刘光金一直干了两三年，才调到低压炉烧火。
    爷儿俩一星期领十八斤豆饼面，不管吃饱。为了养家，多领一点豆饼面，月终算账倒欠工厂一百多元。没办法啦，打加班。光金的父亲累出肺病来，光金一个人顶两个人干，白天上了班，前半夜再替父亲上班，另外还打加班。经常四十小时不出锅炉房。哪有力气呀？只得扔两锹煤就搂着肚子到一边趴一趴。带着几个比烧饼还小的小豆饼，必须有计划的吃。
    父亲的肺病越来越严重，不忍心连累孩子们，就偷偷的拿了麻绳到永定河滩树林里去上吊，幸亏被别人救了回来。爷儿俩相见，大哭一场。光金劝父亲说：“受罪、挨饿，咱一家在一起，您千万别寻短见！安心治病、养病。您尽管借、赊。借的出来就花；赊的出来就吃。我死不了反正给您还账；我这一辈儿还不清，下辈孩子们再接着还！”
    父亲说不上话来，心里绞疼。肺病一天天严重，还是病死了。死的时候，连买棺材连还债，又借了一百多元。这就是那个时代在工厂里干了一辈子的老工友，汗流尽了，人熬干了，到老来下场是这样！
    1948年12月石景山解放了。在刘光金和所有的工友面前，展开一个崭新的时代。像父亲那一代老工人的命运再也不会重复了。光金在党的领导下，做出许多在旧时代是不可想像的贡献；人民也给予光金崇高的荣誉——劳动模范和北京市人民代表。
    这两个不同时代的工人命运，还不能说明新旧社会的天地之别吗？右派分子如果不是黑了心肠、瞎了眼睛和有意颠倒是非黑白，为什么竟会那样信口雌黄呢？
