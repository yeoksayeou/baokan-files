Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 7th: The International Preparatory Meeting of the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament continued today.

	In the meeting held this morning, representatives from more than ten countries and five international organizations spoke. In their speeches, the representatives strongly called for a ban on nuclear weapons testing and the signing of international agreements on arms reduction.

	Chinese representative Zhao Puchu said, "We will never allow the manufacturing and testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs to further pollute the air, sea, and land, and to threaten the peace and prosperity of mankind."

	Zhao Puchu said that the 600 million people of China demand that countries possessing nuclear weapons immediately sign an agreement to stop manufacturing and testing nuclear weapons. Zhao Puchu concluded by saying, "Let us replace hatred with friendship, and war with peace." His speech was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience.

	Indian representative, Mrs. Rameshwari Nehru, took the stage amidst enthusiastic applause, saying that ideological differences should not hinder efforts for peace. The entire people of India believe that manufacturing nuclear weapons is a vile act of creating disaster.

	Following her was the head of the Indian delegation, Chandra, who said that the biggest victims of nuclear weapons testing are Asians, so we are particularly concerned about the issue of nuclear testing and atomic bases, and resolutely oppose the United States' attempts to legitimize nuclear weapons testing.

	Han Dezhu, Chairman of the Central Council of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, spoke on behalf of the delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, whose representatives were unable to attend. He first expressed regret that the Japanese government had obstructed the entry of the Korean delegation. He then pointed out that the United States recently violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and brought new weapons into South Korea, seriously threatening world peace. Finally, he stated that the Korean people firmly demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the immediate convening of an international conference to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea.

	Egyptian delegation leader, Khalid Mohi El-Din, said that in Egypt, the government and the people are united in opposing foreign imperialist forces, opposing the establishment of foreign military bases, and the manufacturing and testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and are fighting for peace.

	Australian representative Anderson, in his speech, called on the conference to promote the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and to help prevent foreign countries from conducting nuclear weapons tests on Australian territory.

	British representative Rotblat refuted the American claim of a "clean hydrogen bomb" at the meeting.

	American representative Jekko reported at the meeting that on August 6th, eleven American peace activists entered the nuclear weapons testing area in Nevada, USA, to demonstrate against nuclear weapons testing, and as a result, they were arrested by the American government authorities. Upon hearing this news, the representatives unanimously expressed their indignation and decided to send a telegram to encourage and support the eleven peace activists who were arrested.

	Representatives from Austria, Portugal, Peru, Ceylon, Japan, Indonesia, New Zealand, Thailand, and eight other countries also spoke at the morning meeting.

	This afternoon, representatives from various countries were divided into two groups, the Asia-Pacific region and the European region, to discuss the issue of demanding that the United Nations and governments of various countries ban nuclear weapons.

	At the International Preparatory Meeting held yesterday afternoon, representatives from six countries, including Japan, Austria, Australia, Ceylon, France, and the United Kingdom, spoke. Japanese representative Yoshitaro Hirano said in his speech that the Japanese people demand a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons, especially the prohibition of the use, testing, production, and storage of large nuclear weapons, to promote world peace.
