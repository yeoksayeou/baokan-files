Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, August 13th. Shao Xiangyi, president of Shanxi Medical College and hygiene expert, has been praised for his resolute struggle against rightist elements.

On the eve of the Great Blooming and Contending, rightist elements in the college began their conspiracy. They first cunningly attempted to drag Shao Xiangyi into their camp, wanting him to admit that the Communist Party in the school was "substituting the Party for the government" and that he "had the title but no power." Shao Xiangyi replied at the time, "The leadership of the college is collective leadership with division of responsibilities. Much of the work has gone through me, so I don't feel like I have the title but no power. The Party committee in the school is not managing too much, but rather managing too little."

During the Great Blooming and Contending, rightist elements fabricated that Shao Xiangyi had been squeezed out of Jiangsu Medical College by Party members. At the same time, they put up inflammatory big-character posters, spreading the rumor that Shao Xiangyi "had the title but no power" and "dared not speak out." Rightist elements also incited some deceived students to talk to Shao Xiangyi. Rightist elements at Jiangsu Medical College echoed each other, writing letters to Shao Xiangyi, "welcoming" him back to Jiangsu. Under this siege, Shao Xiangyi always adhered to the correct stand. He refused all the enticements of the rightist elements and posted a big-character poster, warning the rightist elements: I volunteered to obey the needs of the state, in order to cooperate with industrial construction and concentrate efforts on training hygiene and epidemic prevention personnel in Shanxi; I have both power and position in the school. Why are you spreading rumors and creating trouble? What are your intentions? In this way, the conspiracy of the rightist elements to win over Shao Xiangyi and confront the Party was exposed in front of the teachers and students of the whole school.

Afterwards, Shao Xiangyi actively participated in the struggle to counterattack the rightist elements. When the school organized forums to refute the rightist arguments, he was the first to step onto the podium and gave a speech entitled "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China," refuting the fallacies put forward by the rightist elements, such as abolishing the Party's leadership in the school and that the Party cannot lead science. He also actively criticized and exposed the reactionary words and deeds of some rightist elements at many debates.

Why was Shao Xiangyi able to fight so resolutely against the rightist elements? He said that it was because he had not forgotten the dark life of the old society. At that time, there was not even a department of hygiene in the whole country, and only one course in hygiene was offered in medical colleges. Although he taught hygiene, it was difficult for students to use it after graduation, because the reactionary government simply did not pay attention to mass hygiene and epidemic prevention work. At that time, he was often ashamed of saying empty words and felt sorry for the students. After liberation, he saw with his own eyes that everything had changed. The People's Government attached great importance to hygiene and epidemic prevention work, and has made many achievements in the past eight years. Cholera, which used to be a major epidemic every few years in the old society, has not occurred since liberation; plague and smallpox have been basically controlled; the infant mortality rate has decreased, and people's life expectancy has increased; the People's Government has, for the first time, established a department of public health in medical colleges, and he also has the working conditions to fully display his talents. These vivid facts have made him love the Communist Party and the people even more. Shao Xiangyi said: "When the rightist elements are trying to undermine the Communist Party and restore the dark rule of the Kuomintang era, how can I not persist in fighting them?"

### 山西医学院院长、卫生学专家邵象伊  不受右派诱骗拉拢  站稳立场坚决斗争

    不受右派诱骗拉拢
    站稳立场坚决斗争
    新华社太原13日电　山西医学院院长、卫生学专家邵象伊坚决向右派分子进行斗争的行为，受到了人们的赞扬。
    在大鸣大放的前夕，这个学院的右派分子就开始了阴谋活动，他们首先狡猾地企图拉邵象伊下水，要他承认学校内共产党“以党代政”和他“有职无权”。邵象伊当时回答说：“学院的领导是集体领导、分工负责，很多有关工作都通过了我，因此并没有有职无权的感觉。学校里党委不是管的宽了，而是管得少了。”
    当大鸣大放时，右派分子又捏造邵象伊是被江苏医学院党员排挤出来的，同时贴出了煽动性的大字报，散布邵象伊“有职无权”，“不敢鸣放”等谰言。右派分子还怂恿一些受骗的学生找邵象伊谈话。江苏医学院的右派分子也互相呼应，写信给邵象伊，“欢迎”他重回江苏。在这种种围攻下，邵象伊始终坚持正确的立场。他拒绝右派分子的一切拉拢，同时贴出大字报正告右派分子：我是志愿服从国家需要，是为了配合工业建设，集中力量训练卫生防疫人材而来山西的；我在学校既有权又有职。为什么你们要造谣生事？你们的居心何在？这样，右派分子企图拉拢邵象伊和党对抗的阴谋在全校师生面前被揭穿了。
    接着邵象伊又积极地参加了反击右派分子的斗争。学校组织论坛反驳右派言论时，他第一个走上了讲坛，以“没有共产党就没有新中国”为题，反驳了右派分子提出的取消共产党在学校的领导，党不能领导科学等谬论。他还在很多次辩论会上，积极地批判和揭露了一些右派分子的反动言行。
    为什么邵象伊能够这样坚决地向右派分子进行斗争呢？他说，那是因他没有忘记旧社会那种黑暗的生活。那时，全国连一个卫生系都没有，只在医学院设有卫生学一门课。他虽然讲卫生学，但学生毕业后很难用得上，因为反动政府根本就不重视群众性的卫生防疫工作。那时他常为自己说空话而惭愧，为学生难受。解放后他亲眼看到一切都变了，人民政府很重视卫生防疫工作，并且八年来已取得了不少成绩。旧社会几年要大流行一次的霍乱，解放后就没有发生过，鼠疫、天花基本上被控制了；婴儿的死亡率降低，人的寿命增加了；人民政府破天荒的在医学院设立了公共卫生系，自己也有充分发挥才能的工作条件。这些活生生的事实，使他更加热爱共产党、热爱人民。邵象伊说：“当右派分子企图搞垮共产党，恢复国民党时代的黑暗统治时，我怎么能不和他们坚持斗争呢。”
