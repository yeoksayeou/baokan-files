Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th. How did Luo Longji consistently act in a pro-American, Chiang-worshipping, and anti-Chinese Communist Party manner? Newly discovered Kuomintang archival materials provide one aspect of the situation.

The Nanjing Historical Materials Compilation Office of the Third Institute of the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered a portion of the original intelligence drafts and internal circulars of the Kuomintang Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. In a report written in ink, marked as received on October 20, 1945, Kuomintang special agents reported Luo Longji's comments on the current situation at the time: "When the Kuomintang is in power, although various parties and factions cannot move freely, if the Communist Party seizes power one day and the Kuomintang collapses, then the various parties and factions will have no room to stand. Therefore, it is hoped that the two parties will contend with each other, neither fighting nor making peace, and continue the current situation (Editor's note by Xinhua News Agency: At that time, the people of the whole country demanded peace. Chairman Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing to negotiate with the Kuomintang in order to seek a peaceful resolution of domestic problems. The Democratic League also issued an 'urgent appeal in the midst of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War,' advocating democracy and peace. However, the Kuomintang relied on American imperialism to send troops to North China and Northeast China, preparing to attack the liberated areas), so that various parties and factions will have the opportunity to rise."

In October 1945, the Democratic League held a temporary national congress in Chongqing. According to another Kuomintang internal mimeographed report on October 27 of the same year: "Before the temporary congress of the Democratic League, Luo Longji, Pan Guangdan, and others secretly discussed with Long Yun to support Long as the leader of the Democratic League, with Yunnan as the base and the Yunnan army as the military force, to establish a special regime and expand political appeals!"

In the aforementioned intelligence report of October 20, 1945, Kuomintang special agents also reported Luo Longji's view on the reasons for the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, saying: "Luo Longji told people: the key to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War lies in two people. The first is that Chairman Chiang had a clear understanding of the Far East issue, and the second is that Roosevelt's view of the Far East issue was the same as Chiang's, just like Zhou Yu and Kong Ming in the Three Kingdoms period wanted to use fire to deal with the Battle of Red Cliffs. If Roosevelt had not been able to see Chairman Chiang's insights on this issue and give him full support, China's Anti-Japanese War would probably not have achieved this result." Here, Luo Longji completely erased the persistence of the people of the whole country in the Anti-Japanese War under the leadership of the Communist Party, as well as the assistance of the Soviet Union.

### 罗隆基一贯亲美崇蒋仇共  从国民党特务机关的档案中发现了新材料

    罗隆基一贯亲美崇蒋仇共
    从国民党特务机关的档案中发现了新材料
    新华社南京7日电　罗隆基是怎样一贯地亲美崇蒋，敌视中国共产党的？新发现的国民党档案材料提供了一个方面的情况。
    中国科学院历史研究所第三所南京史料整理处发现了国民党中央调查统计局的一部分情报原稿和内部通报。在注明1945年10月20日收到的一份墨笔写的报告上，国民党特务报告了罗隆基对当时时局的谈话说：“国民党掌政时，各党各派虽不能自由活动，假使一朝共产党握得政权而国民党垮台时，则各党派将更无立足之余地。故希望两党互相争持，不战不和，继续目前之局势（新华社编者按：当时全国人民要求和平，毛泽东主席为了谋求国内问题的和平解决还亲自到重庆同国民党谈判，民盟也发出“在抗战胜利声中紧急呼吁”主张民主和平，而国民党却依赖美帝国主义向华北、东北调兵遣将，准备进攻解放区），各党派始有抬头之机会。”
    1945年10月民盟在重庆举行临时全国代表大会。据另一份同年10月27日国民党内部油印报告上写道：“民盟临时代表大会前，罗隆基、潘光旦等曾与龙云密商，拟拥龙为民盟首领，以云南为地盘，滇军为武力，成立特殊政权，扩大政治号召！”
    在上述1945年10月20日的一份情报上，国民党特务还报告了罗隆基关于抗战胜利原因的看法说：“罗隆基对人表示：抗战胜利关键在二人，第一是蒋主席对远东问题想得通，第二是罗斯福对远东问题的看法与蒋氏相同，正如三国时周瑜与孔明在想用火攻以应付赤壁之战一样，如果没有罗斯福能看出蒋主席对此问题见解而予以全力帮助时，中国抗战，恐无此果。”罗隆基这里把全国人民在共产党领导下坚持抗战胜利以及苏联的援助等，一笔抹杀。
