　　Henan's Some Leading Cadres Need to Thoroughly Overcome Rightist Thinking

　　(Our Dispatch) A large-scale debate centered on the grain issue is gradually unfolding in rural Henan Province. After carrying out large-scale debates, Huaibin, Anyang, Xinye and other counties overfulfilled the summer grain purchase task in early this month.

　　However, at present, some leading cadres at or above the county level in Henan Province still have concerns about immediately launching a large-scale debate on the two roads in rural areas. For example, some prefectural committee secretaries believe that "production is very tight now, and it is not easy to control a widespread debate," worrying that it will cause chaos. In particular, some leading cadres with rightist thinking emphasize practical difficulties in solving the grain problem, and do not recognize the importance of solving ideological problems. Therefore, they lack confidence in carrying out a large-scale debate centered on the grain problem.

　　In order to smoothly carry out socialist propaganda and education in rural areas, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently emphasized the issue of overcoming rightist thinking at a provincial party committee plenary session. The meeting called on all party cadres to correctly understand the rural situation, thoroughly criticize rightist thinking, and rapidly launch the large-scale debate on the two roads.

　　河南部分领导干部需要彻底克服右倾思想
    本报讯　河南省农村以粮食问题为中心的大辩论，正在逐步开展。淮滨、安阳、新野等县经过开展大辩论，已于本月上旬超额完成夏粮征购任务。
    但是，目前河南省部分县以上的领导干部，对于立即在农村开展两条道路的大辩论，还有顾虑。如有的地委书记认为“现在生产很紧张，普遍开展辩论不好掌握”，耽心搞乱了。特别是一部分有右倾思想的领导干部，对解决粮食问题强调实际困难，不认识解决思想问题的重要性，因此，对开展以粮食问题为中心的大辩论更是缺乏信心。
    为了顺利开展农村的社会主义宣传教育，中共河南省委在最近召开的一次省委全会上，强调提出了克服右倾思想的问题。会议要求全党干部正确认识农村形势，彻底批判右倾思想，把两条道路的大辩论迅速地开展起来。　（王昌隆）
