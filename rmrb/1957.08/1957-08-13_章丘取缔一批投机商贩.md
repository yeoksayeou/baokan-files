    Zhangqiu Cracks Down on a Group of Speculators and Profiteers
    (Our newspaper, Zhangqiu, 12th) The Zhangqiu County of Shandong Province recently cracked down on a group of grain merchants and peddlers. The old-time grain merchants, Wei Shoulu, Zhou Chuan Kong, and Shao Jinfeng, who have repeatedly refused to mend their ways despite education, have been arrested and dealt with by the government according to law. More than twenty people, including Feng Peixing, who transported more than 1,000 jin of grain, had their grain auctioned off or confiscated based on the amount of grain they traded and the extent of their sabotage activities. They themselves were handed over to the commune for labor reform or subject to criticism and education. Small grain peddlers or those who traded grain for the first time were generally subjected to criticism and education.
    These grain merchants and peddlers played a very bad role in the unified purchase and sale of grain. After the opening of the free grain market, they became even more rampant in their activities. Feng Peixing bought millet at a high price of 0.27 yuan per jin and sold it for 0.32 yuan; wheat was bought for 0.30 yuan and sold for 0.36 yuan; peanuts were bought for 0.30 yuan and sold for 0.38 yuan. As a result, some farmers were unwilling to sell their surplus grain to the state but went to the black market to sell it, or sold their rations and then reached out to the state for grain. Some even bought grain from state granaries and sold it on the black market. Wei Shoulu and Zhou Chuan Kong openly bought grain at high prices in the free market, so that the amount of grain in the local free market reached over 50,000 to 60,000 jin per day. They trafficked over 20,000 jin of grain during this summer's grain procurement alone and frequently went to the countryside to engage in grain trading. Currently, the people of Zhangqiu County continue to expose and denounce [these activities], plugging the loopholes through which grain merchants and peddlers speculate in the countryside.

    章丘取缔一批投机商贩
    本报章丘12日电　山东省章丘县最近取缔了一批粮商、粮贩。屡教不改的老牌粮商隗寿禄、周传孔、邵金峰三人已被政府逮捕法办。贩运千斤粮食以上的冯培兴等二十余人，分别贩卖粮食多少和破坏活动情况，将粮食拍卖和没收，其本人交社管制劳动改造或批评教育。对小粮贩或初次贩卖粮食的，一般进行批评教育。
    这些粮商粮贩在统购统销中，起了很坏的作用。粮食自由市场开放后，他们更是猖狂活动。冯培兴用每斤谷子二角七的高价收买后，以三角二卖出；麦子用三角买进，以三角六卖出；花生用三角买进，以三角八卖出。因此，影响到一部分农民不愿把余粮卖给国家，而到黑市上去卖，或者把口粮卖掉再伸手向国家要粮，甚至有的从国家粮库买出粮食，再到黑市上去卖。隗寿禄和周传孔竟公开在自由市场上用高价收粮，以致使当地自由市场上的粮食，一天上过五、六万斤。他们仅在今年夏季征购中就贩卖粮食二万多斤，还经常到农村串连买卖粮食。目前章丘县人民继续检举揭发，堵塞粮商粮贩在农村投机活动的漏洞。
