    In Fraternal Countries
    History of the Workers' Movement in Central and Southeastern European Countries to Be Published Soon
    To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, historians from fraternal countries in Central and Southeastern Europe and Soviet historians will jointly write a book on the impact of the October Revolution on the workers' movement and national liberation movement in Central and Southeastern European countries. The Hungarian Institute of Party History has been entrusted with organizing this work.
    The writing plan was jointly determined in 1954: the Soviet side will be responsible for compiling relevant documents from the Institute of Marxism-Leninism on Lenin's discussion of the workers' movement in Central and Southeastern European countries and the Comintern. Each fraternal country will be responsible for writing about the impact of the October Socialist Revolution on its own country's labor movement and national liberation movement during the period of 1917-1923.
    The Hungarian Institute of Party History has now received manuscripts from the Institutes of Party History of Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania (Albania's is the Institute of History and Linguistics), totaling more than 1,200 pages, which will be published in two volumes. It has now been decided to convene an editorial meeting in Budapest in September this year to finalize the publication issues.

    中南欧国家工人运动史即将出版
    为纪念十月社会主义革命四十周年，中南欧兄弟国家的史学家们和苏联的史学家们将合作编写关于十月革命对中南欧国家工人运动和民族解放运动的影响一书，并委托匈牙利党史研究所负责组织这项工作。
    1954年曾共同确定了编写计划：苏联方面由马列学院编写有关列宁论述中南欧各国工人运动以及共产国际的有关文献。各兄弟国家则分别编写十月社会主义革命在1917—1923年期间对本国工运和民族解放运动的影响。
    现在匈牙利党史研究所已先后收到德、波、捷、罗、保、阿各国党史研究所（阿尔巴尼亚为历史和语言研究所）送来的稿件，共约有一千二百多页，将分上下两册出版。现在已决定于本年9月在布达佩斯召集一次编辑会议，以便最后确定出版问题。
