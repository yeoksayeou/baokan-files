　　A Farmhouse in the Suburbs of Beijing

　　During the Japanese occupation, the family of Gao Fengkui, a member of the Huaifang Agricultural Cooperative in the Nanyuan District of Beijing's suburbs, lived a life of oppression by landlords and begging from door to door. At that time, Gao Fengkui took his twelve-year-old eldest son, Gaoxing, to work as a long-term laborer for the landlord. Although they worked day and night, their income was still not enough to support the family. Old Mother Gao had to take her youngest son, Gao Wang, to beg for food everywhere. Sometimes they got nothing and were even bitten by the landlord's vicious dogs, leaving them covered in blood. After the Japanese surrender, everyone except the youngest son worked for the landlord, but when the winter slack season came, the whole family still could not escape hunger.

　　During the land reform, Gao Fengkui's family stood up. Especially after the rural collectivization, their lives became more and more prosperous. Now, the family of five lives well, and the eldest son is already married. His wife, Xu Wenzhen, is a graduate of higher primary school. The second son is also about to get married. In February of this year, they used the family's labor savings to build three new houses, and they plan to build two more by the end of the year.

　　"Such a life is not easy to come by!" Gao Fengkui always says with indignation when he talks about the rumors and slanders of the rightists about rural issues and the lives of farmers: "Without the leadership of the Party, without land reform and collectivization, where could our family have such a life!"

　　White rice porridge and steamed buns, remembering the pig feed and wild vegetables of the past, make today's food even more fragrant.

　　京郊一农家
    北京市郊南苑区槐房农业社的社员高凤魁一家，在日本占领期间，过着受地主压迫和沿门乞食的日子。那时高凤魁带着十二岁的大儿子高兴给地主当长工。虽然白天黑夜干，收入还是养活不了一家人，高老大娘只得领着小儿子高旺到处要饭，有时候什么也没有讨到，还被地主家的恶狗咬得鲜血淋漓。日本投降后，一家人除了小儿子外，都给地主扛活，但一到冬季农闲，全家还是摆脱不了饥饿。
    在土地改革中，高凤魁一家翻了身。特别是农村合作化以后，日子越过越兴旺。现在一家五口人，大儿子已经结了婚。媳妇徐文珍是高小毕业生。二儿子也快要结婚了。今年2月，用全家的劳动的积余盖了三间新房，年底还准备再盖两间。
    “这样的日子得来不容易啊！”高凤魁一谈到右派分子对农村问题和农民生活的造谣诬蔑时，总是激愤地说：“没有党的领导，没有土改和合作化，我们一家人哪里能有这样的生活！”

　　高兴和徐文珍劳动休息时，在社里的灌溉渠里洗濯，生活多么幸福！
