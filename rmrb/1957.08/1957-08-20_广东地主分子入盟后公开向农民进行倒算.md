The Guangdong Provincial Organization of the China Democratic League implemented the "large-scale development" policy of the Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji clique. In the nine months from September of last year to May of this year, it newly developed 1,313 members. This number is one and a half times more than the total number of members developed in the previous five years. The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League once proposed to develop members on a large scale in seven areas. These are: universities and schools of all sizes, science and technology, culture and art, news and publishing, technical personnel, state organs, and medicine and health. During the period of large-scale development from September of last year to May of this year, the number of League members in primary schools alone increased from one to one hundred and eighty-four.

In this "large-scale development," the Guangdong Provincial Organization of the China Democratic League blossomed everywhere, consciously absorbing a large number of elements who were seriously dissatisfied with the Party and the government into the League. In Haikang County, it developed two landlord elements. Wu Lin, a landlord element and deputy county magistrate of Haikang County who joined the League in November of last year, recently not only carried out counter-settlement against peasants himself, but also incited and supported other landlord elements to rise up and carry out counter-settlement against peasants. Guangzhou City also developed a group of people who were previously subject to suppression of counter-revolutionaries, had complex histories, and were dissatisfied with the Party. Most of the more than ten new League members of Guangzhou Normal College were elements dissatisfied with the Party and the government, including two rightists and two people with serious rightist remarks. Yu Fensheng, a lecturer at Guangzhou Normal College who joined the China Democratic League during the large-scale development, openly slandered the CCP school Party Committee as a breeding ground for the "three evils" and arrogantly advocated that the CCP Party Committee should only occupy one vote on the school committee. At the same time, he also incited students to make trouble.

Although the CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee and local Party Committee United Front Work Departments had suggested to the local China Democratic League organizations that they hope to consolidate their ranks and develop steadily, these opinions were not adopted. In Zhanjiang, the China Democratic League organization ignored the advice of the Municipal Party Committee United Front Work Department and indiscriminately accepted some middle school teachers who had a bad reputation among intellectuals into the League.

    广东地主分子入盟后公开向农民进行倒算
    民盟广东省组织执行章伯钧、罗隆基集团“大发展”方针，从去年9月到今年5月的九个月中，新发展了一千三百一十三人入盟。这个数字比这以前的五年多时间发展的盟员总数还多一倍半。民盟广东省委曾提出向七个方面大发展盟员。这就是：大中小学校，科学技术，文化艺术，新闻出版，技术人员，国家机关，医药卫生。从去年9月到今年5月大发展期间，仅在小学校里的盟员就从一个人发展到一百八十四人。
    民盟广东省组织在这个“大发展”中四面开花，有意识地吸收了大批对党和政府严重不满的分子入盟，他们在海康县发展了两个地主分子，去年11月入盟的地主分子、海康县副县长吴林最近除自己向农民倒算外，还煽动和支持其他地主分子起来向农民倒算。广州市也发展了一批过去的肃反对象、历史复杂和对党不满的人。广州师范专科学校十多个新盟员，大部分是对党和政府不满分子，其中有两个右派分子和两个有严重右派言论的人。大发展中加入民盟的广州师范专科学校讲师于奋生，公开污蔑中共学校党委会是“三害”的温床，狂妄地主张中共党委会只能占校委会的一票。同时，他还煽动学生闹事。
    虽然中共广东省委和各地党委统战部曾经向当地民盟组织建议，希望他们巩固队伍稳步发展，但是这些意见没有被采纳。在湛江，民盟组织不听市委统战部的劝告，滥收了一些平日在知识分子中观感不好的中学教师入盟。　（冯子平）
