Rapid Development of China's Pharmaceutical Industry
    Raw Materials and Medicines Increase by Over a Hundred, Total Production Value Increases Nearly Fivefold

    (Our Dispatch) China's pharmaceutical industry has seen great development in recent years. The total industrial output value of the national pharmaceutical industry in 1957 is projected to increase nearly fivefold compared to 1952, with an absolute value reaching approximately 1.2 billion yuan. Among these, the enterprises directly under the central government have grown the fastest. The total output value expected to be completed in 1957 will exceed the 1957 level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan by 80%, an increase of eightfold compared to 1952.

    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the national pharmaceutical industry sector will have newly built, expanded, and renovated more than fifty projects. Due to the continuous commissioning of new enterprises, coupled with the exploitation of the production potential of existing enterprises and the strengthening of new product research and trial production, the output of major products has increased significantly. For example, antibiotic products, which are increasingly widely used in medical treatment and have special therapeutic effects on many stubborn diseases, only had small-scale experimental production of penicillin in 1952. Now, penicillin, chloramphenicol, and chlortetracycline can be produced on a larger scale, and the total output expected in 1957 will increase by more than 890 times compared to 1952. Among them, the output of penicillin and chloramphenicol reached the 1957 production level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan one year and eight months ahead of schedule.

    During the First Five-Year Plan, more than 73% of the pharmaceutical industry's basic construction investment was used to develop the production of antibiotics. After the large-scale, fully modernized antibiotic factory aided by the Soviet Union is put into production in 1958, the output of penicillin and streptomycin will basically meet the needs of domestic medical departments that year.

    The national output of various sulfonamide drugs in 1952 was only more than 80 tons. The expected output in 1957 will reach approximately 1,800 tons, exceeding the 1957 level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan by more than 107%, an increase of more than 21 times compared to 1952. The expected output of medical and edible glucose in 1957 will be nearly 6,000 tons, an increase of more than 12 times compared to 1952. The output of other products such as DDT, phenacetin, and various injections and tablets has also increased rapidly.

    In terms of new product research and trial production, great achievements have been made due to the efforts of the vast number of workers, staff, and engineering technicians. In the past five years, the enterprises under the Pharmaceutical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Chemical Industry alone have added 58 new raw materials and medicines. If the new products successfully researched and trial-produced by local enterprises are added, the total number will be over one hundred.

    Due to the development of production and the continuous increase of new types of products, drug imports have decreased significantly. According to customs statistics, the total value of drug imports in 1953 reached more than 120 million yuan. In 1956, imports were only more than 40 million yuan, a decrease of more than 66% compared to 1953. Many varieties have not only completely stopped importing, but can also be exported in small quantities every year. (Zhang Yutao)

    我国医药工业飞速发展
    原料药品增加上百种　生产总值增长近五倍
    本报讯　我国医药工业几年来有很大发展。全国医药工业总产值1957年预计比1952年增长将近五倍，其绝对值将达到十二亿元左右。其中中央所属企业增长的速度最快，1957年预计完成的总产值将超过五年计划规定的1957年水平80％，比1952年增长八倍。
    第一个五年计划期间，全国医药工业部门新建、扩建、改建的工程项目将达到五十个以上。由于新企业不断地投入生产，加上原有企业生产潜力的发挥，新产品研究试制工作的加强，主要产品产量显著提高。例如：在医疗中应用日益广泛的、对很多顽抗性疾病具有特殊治疗效果的抗生素类产品，1952年仅仅是小型试验性地生产青霉素一种，现在已经能较大规模地生产青霉素、合霉素、金霉素等三个品种了，而且1957年预计的总产量将比1952年增长八百九十倍以上。其中青霉素、合霉素的产量，都提前一年又八个月达到了五年计划规定的1957年的生产水平。
    第一个五年计划期间，医药工业73％以上的基本建设投资，用于发展抗生素的生产。到1958年苏联援助我国建设的规模巨大的完全现代化的抗生素厂投入生产以后，青霉素、链霉素的产量，将基本上满足国内医疗部门当年的需要。
    各种磺胺类药品，1952年全国只能生产八十多吨，1957年预计产量将达到一千八百吨左右，超过五年计划规定的1957年水平107％以上，比1952年增长二十一倍多。医用和食用的葡萄糖，1957年预计产量将近六千吨，比1952年增长十二倍多。其它如滴滴涕、非那西汀和各种针剂、片剂的产量也都有了迅速的增长。
    在新产品研究试制方面，由于广大职工和工程技术人员的努力，取得了巨大的成绩。五年来，仅化学工业部医药工业局所属企业就增加了五十八个新的原料药品，如果加上地方企业研究试制成功的新产品，总数将在一百个以上。
    由于生产的发展，新种类产品不断增加，药品进口显著下降。根据海关统计，1953年药品进口总值达一亿二千多万元，1956年进口仅为四千多万元，比1953年减少了66％以上。有许多品种不但完全停止了进口，而且每年还可以小量出口。　　　　　　　　（张雨涛）
