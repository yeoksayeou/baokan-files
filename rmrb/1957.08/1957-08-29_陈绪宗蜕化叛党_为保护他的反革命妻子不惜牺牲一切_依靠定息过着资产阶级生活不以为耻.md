Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: Staff members of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China have been holding meetings for days, exposing the crimes of Chen Xuzong, a traitor to the Party, who has degenerated and become depraved, lost his stance, defended counter-revolutionaries, and viciously attacked the Party.

Chen Xuzong was a member of the Standing Committee of the Second Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the president of China Youth Daily before June 1955. He was suspended from his duties for reflection due to his connection with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique.

Chen Xuzong's wife, named Jin Huaijin, is a class enemy who infiltrated the Party and is a current counter-revolutionary. From July 1952 to December 1955, Jin Huaijin sent ten anonymous letters, creating chaos, undermining the anti-espionage movement, fabricating facts, and framing revolutionary comrades; hating and slandering the Party and the revolutionary cause, causing losses to the revolutionary cause. After obtaining conclusive evidence of Jin Huaijin's crimes, the public security organs arrested her according to law, and the procuratorate filed a lawsuit against her in the Beijing Intermediate People's Court. After interrogation, the court sentenced the counter-revolutionary Jin Huaijin to three years of imprisonment. From the day the Jin Huaijin counter-revolutionary case was cracked, Chen Xuzong, who claimed to have "nearly twenty years of Party membership," completely forgot that he was a Communist Party member. For more than a year, he racked his brains and used all despicable means to shield the counter-revolutionary, defend the counter-revolutionary, and even encouraged Jin Huaijin not to accept the judgment of the Intermediate People's Court. After the anti-Rightist struggle began, Chen Xuzong still did not awaken. At the five debate meetings of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, he distorted the facts and quibbled in every possible way. Until the recent several meetings, he remained obstinate and stubbornly defended Jin Huaijin to the end.

In the face of the ironclad evidence of Jin Huaijin's crimes, Chen Xuzong closed his eyes to the facts and talked a lot about Jin Huaijin's "good motives." He said that the motives of Jin Huaijin's crimes "were mainly to draw the organization's attention to the suspected persons, investigate, and struggle; secondly, to exonerate her husband, Chen Xuzong, from being investigated (note: Chen Xuzong was suspended from his duties for reflection in the anti-espionage movement due to his connection with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique); and thirdly, to attack others, etc." He even bit back, saying that Jin Huaijin's criminal activities of writing anonymous letters were the result of the organization's lack of active investigation of the people she framed; he also sought various excuses to prove that Jin Huaijin's writing of anonymous letters was not a counter-revolutionary activity, but a manifestation of "love for the revolution." After making the above distortions of facts and sophistry, Chen Xuzong came to the absurd conclusion: Jin Huaijin is not a counter-revolutionary, but a member of the revolutionary ranks.

The staff members of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League pointed out that no matter how Chen Xuzong quibbles and tries every possible means to exonerate Jin Huaijin, Jin Huaijin's current counter-revolutionary crimes cannot be obliterated. First, she created chaos and undermined the anti-espionage movement. Jin Huaijin fabricated a huge espionage organization and espionage methods, attempting to create chaos in the anti-espionage and cadre review work of thirteen units, including China Youth Daily and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and undermine the unity of the revolutionary ranks. Second, she framed revolutionary cadres. In the ten anonymous letters, she falsely accused more than 160 people, of whom 62 were named. Due to Jin Huaijin's framing, some comrades were politically suspected for a long time, some comrades were not allowed to become full Party members for several years after joining the Party, and some comrades were wrongly criticized in the anti-espionage movement. Third, she hated the revolutionary cause, slandered and insulted the Party and leading comrades, and threatened the leading comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, saying "I will kill your whole family." Jin Huaijin also viciously slandered the anti-espionage movement as "dogs biting dogs" and basely and wantonly scolded leading comrades as "mad dogs," etc.

Why does Chen Xuzong have fundamental differences with the comrades' views? Because Chen Xuzong has lost his proletarian stance, betrayed the interests of the Party, and wholeheartedly stood on the side of the counter-revolutionary Jin Huaijin.

According to revelations, Chen Xuzong was indifferent to the serious consequences caused by Jin Huaijin's counter-revolutionary crimes, but he was very concerned about Jin Huaijin. After Jin Huaijin was arrested and imprisoned, Chen Xuzong tried every means to comfort her and wrote letters threatening the doctors in the prison, saying that Jin Huaijin was sick and needed more care; if anything happened to Jin Huaijin, the doctors would be fully responsible. Chen Xuzong was very thoughtful for Jin Huaijin, such as spending 9,000 yuan to buy a house for her and planning how to live after she was released from prison.

In addition, when Chen Xuzong and Jin Huaijin met, he maliciously instigated her to wage a "positive struggle" against the court and colluded with her to appeal to the Beijing Higher People's Court. Chen Xuzong tried every possible means to shield and support Jin Huaijin. On the day of the trial, he deliberately sat at the door of the criminal court. Someone asked him, "Why are you sitting at the door?" He said, "I want Jin Huaijin to know that I am supporting her spiritually." After Jin Huaijin was sentenced, Chen Xuzong thought that his strength had been exhausted, so he concealed it from the Party and ran around, spreading rumors and maliciously slandering and attacking the Party and some leading comrades. Finally, he carried out non-organizational activities behind the Party's back and even wanted to collude with the Rightists in society to attack the Party together to overturn Jin Huaijin's case. He once declared: "For Jin Huaijin, I can sacrifice everything." Someone asked him: "You only care about Jin Huaijin, what if you lose your Party membership?" Chen said: "What can I do?" Chen once said to another person: "In order to adhere to 'truth,' I am not afraid of losing my meal ticket, election ticket, or Party ticket."

For Jin Huaijin, Chen Xuzong illegally communicated secretly with criminals. Some criminals who were released from prison after serving their sentences illegally brought letters from Jin Huaijin to Chen Xuzong and became honored guests in Chen's house. Chen Xuzong concealed these illegal activities from the Party. Fearing that the organization would investigate these illegal letters, Chen Xuzong simply tore up the letters.

After the Jin Huaijin counter-revolutionary case was cracked, Chen Xuzong had been resisting the Party's conclusion on the counter-revolutionary Jin Huaijin. However, every time he could not justify himself and was refuted by the comrades, he had to temporarily affirm that Jin Huaijin was a counter-revolutionary. However, every time, he would overturn the case in a few days. In more than a year, he affirmed and denied it five or six times. This was completely a two-faced tactic played by Chen Xuzong. This spring, Chen Xuzong went outside to find a lawyer behind the Party's back, revealing Party secrets and maliciously attacking the Party. He repeatedly refused the advice of the Party and comrades and personally appeared in court to defend the counter-revolutionary. His two defenses were full of vicious slanders against the Party. In court, he repeatedly said that he was an "old Party member" and a "responsible cadre." He tried his best to attribute the objective reasons for Jin Huaijin's crimes to himself, attempting to use his "nearly twenty years of Party membership" to resist, and his intention was extremely despicable.

Chen Xuzong is a Party member who joined the Party in 1939. During the Anti-Japanese War, he was strictly investigated by the Party in Yan'an, so he harbored dissatisfaction for a long time and still "felt very uncomfortable in his heart." In the anti-espionage movement, he was suspended from his duties for reflection due to his connection with the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng, and he was investigated again due to his relationship with Jin Huaijin. From then on, Chen Xuzong became more resentful and completely stood on the opposite side of the Party. When the bourgeois Rightists frantically attacked the Party, Chen Xuzong secretly cheered. He cooperated with the Rightists, slandering our anti-espionage movement, saying that it "hurt a lot of people" and was messed up. He took the opportunity to overturn his case, saying that the Party should not have investigated him. After reading the speech of the Rightist Huang Shaohong attacking the Party, he said: "I think Huang Shaohong's remarks on the legal system are very correct." He also went to Jin Huaijin's brother to incite him to overturn Jin Huaijin's case. After the anti-Rightist struggle began, Chen also exonerated the Rightists, saying that Liu Binyan and Lin Xiling were not Rightists; saying that the speech of the Rightist Tan Tiwu "can still justify itself."

Chen Xuzong was born into a large bourgeois family. After joining the Party, he did not transform himself thoroughly. After entering the city, he married Jin Huaijin, who was born into a large bourgeois family. His bourgeois mother lives with him and now receives more than 6,000 yuan in fixed interest every year. Chen Xuzong used this money to buy a house, waiting for Jin Huaijin to come back and enjoy it together. As a Communist Party member, Chen has become accustomed to the bourgeois lifestyle and exploiting to support his family by relying on fixed interest, and he is not ashamed of it. It is precisely because he has completely degenerated that he said to others: "In the past two years, I have accumulated three experiences: 1. It is difficult to find a true comrade; 2. Trust is hypocrisy, and ability is real; 3. People are complex, and naivete is not allowed." The staff members pointed out that Chen Xuzong's fallacies are completely the bourgeois philosophy of life and an extremely vicious slander against the Party and the new society. Chen Xuzong has completely become a reactionary element in the bourgeoisie and a spokesperson for the counter-revolutionaries and Rightists within the Party.

### 陈绪宗蜕化叛党　为保护他的反革命妻子不惜牺牲一切  依靠定息过着资产阶级生活不以为耻

　　陈绪宗蜕化叛党
　　为保护他的反革命妻子不惜牺牲一切
　  依靠定息过着资产阶级生活不以为耻
    据新华社28日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央机关工作人员连日集会，揭发叛党分子陈绪宗蜕化变质、丧失立场、为反革命分子辩护、向党恶毒进攻的罪行。
    陈绪宗1955年6月以前是青年团二届中央常委，任中国青年报社社长，他因与胡风反革命集团有联系而被停职反省。
    陈绪宗的妻子名叫金怀瑾，是混入党内的阶级敌对分子，是现行反革命犯。从1952年7月到1955年12月，金怀瑾先后发出十封匿名信，制造混乱，破坏肃反运动、捏造事实，陷害革命同志；仇恨、污蔑党和革命事业，给革命事业带来损失。公安机关在获得金怀瑾犯罪的确凿证据以后，依法予以逮捕，并由检察院向北京市中级人民法院起诉。法院经过审讯以后，判处反革命犯金怀瑾有期徒刑三年。从破获金怀瑾反革命案那天起，自称“近二十年党龄”的“老干部”陈绪宗，完全忘记了自己是一个共产党员，一年多来挖空心思，使尽一切卑鄙手段，包庇反革命，为反革命进行辩护，最后还鼓动金犯不服从中级法院的判决。反右派斗争展开以后，陈绪宗仍不觉醒，在团中央宣传部的五次辩论会上，歪曲事实，百般狡辩，直到最近的几次大会上，仍执迷不悟，顽强地替金犯狡辩到底。
    在金怀瑾犯罪的铁证面前，陈绪宗闭眼不看事实，大谈其金犯“良好的动机”。他说，金怀瑾犯罪的动机，“主要是为了引起组织对被怀疑者的注意、侦察、斗争，其次是为了开脱其丈夫陈绪宗的被审查（注：陈绪宗因与胡风反革命集团有联系，在肃反中曾停职反省），再次才是为了打击别人等。”他还反咬一口，把金犯写匿名信的罪恶活动，说成是由于组织上对被她陷害的人侦察不积极的结果；他还找寻各种借口，力图证明金犯写匿名信不但不是反革命的活动，而且是一种“热爱革命”的表现。陈绪宗作了以上的歪曲事实、颠倒是非的狡辩以后，就得出荒谬的结论：金怀瑾不是反革命，而是革命队伍中的一员。
    团中央的工作人员们指出，不管陈绪宗如何狡辩，千方百计为金犯开脱罪行，金怀瑾现行反革命的罪行是怎样也抹煞不了的。首先，她制造混乱，破坏肃反运动。金犯捏造了庞大的特务组织和特务活动方法，企图给中国青年报社、团中央等十三个单位的肃反和审干工作制造混乱，破坏革命队伍的团结。其次，陷害革命干部。她在十封匿名信中，诬陷了一百六十多人，其中指名指姓的就有六十二人。由于金犯的陷害，有的同志长期在政治上受怀疑，有的同志入党后几年不得转为正式党员，有的同志在肃反中被斗错了。第三，仇恨革命事业，污蔑、辱骂党和领导同志，恐吓团中央领导同志说“要杀你一家人”。金犯还恶毒地诬蔑肃反运动是“狗咬狗”，卑鄙地肆意谩骂领导同志是“疯狗”等。
    陈绪宗为什么和同志们的看法有根本的分歧呢？因为陈绪宗已经丧失了无产阶级立场，背叛了党的利益，死心踏地地站到反革命犯金怀瑾的立场上去了。
    据揭露，陈绪宗对金犯的反革命罪行所引起的严重后果无动于衷，但是对金犯却十分关心。当金犯被捕入狱后，陈绪宗想尽各种办法去安慰她，并写过信威胁监狱内的医生，说金犯有病，要多加照顾；如金犯万一有个不好，要医生负完全责任。陈绪宗为金犯想得非常周到，如为她花了九千元买了住宅，为她筹划出狱后如何生活。
    另外，陈绪宗和金犯见面的时候，还恶意煽动她向法院作“正面的斗争”，和她串通一气向北京市高级人民法院上诉。陈绪宗想尽各种方法包庇和支持金犯。开庭审判那一天，他故意坐在刑庭门口。有人问他：“你为什么坐在门口？”他说：“我让金怀瑾知道，我精神上在支持她。”当金犯被判刑以后，陈绪宗自以为力量已尽，就瞒着党到处奔走，散布流言蜚语，恶意中伤、攻击党和一些领导同志。最后，他就背着党进行非组织的活动，甚至想勾结社会上的右派分子，一齐向党进攻，来为金犯翻案。他曾扬言：“为了金怀瑾可以牺牲一切。”有人问他：“你光为金怀瑾，如果丢了党籍怎么办？”陈说：“那有什么办法。”陈向另一人曾说：“为了坚持‘真理’，就是丢了饭票、选举票、党票也不怕。”
    陈绪宗为了金犯，他违法地与犯罪分子暗中来往。有的刑满出狱的犯罪分子，违法替金犯带信给陈绪宗，成为陈家的座上客。陈绪宗向党隐瞒了这些违法活动，怕组织上追查这种违法信件，陈绪宗便干脆将信件撕毁。
    当金犯反革命案破获后，陈绪宗一直反抗党对反革命分子金怀瑾所作的结论。但是，每次当他不能自圆其说，被同志们驳得体无完肤的时候，就不得不暂时肯定金犯是反革命分子。可是，每次都是隔不几天，他就翻案了。在一年多的时间里，他这样地肯定、否定就有五、六次之多。这完全是陈绪宗耍的两面手法。今年春季，陈绪宗背着党到外面去找律师，泄露了党的机密，恶意攻击党。他一再拒绝党和同志们的忠告，亲自出庭为反革命辩护，他的两次辩护词，通篇都是对党的恶毒的污蔑。在法庭上，他还口口声声说自己是“老党员”“负责干部”，他尽量把金怀瑾犯罪的客观原因扯到自己身上，企图拿自己的“近二十年的党龄”来扛着，其用心是极为卑劣的。
    陈绪宗是1939年入党的党员。抗日战争时期，他在延安曾受到党的严格审查，因此长期心怀不满，直到现在还“心里很难受”。肃反中，他因与反革命分子胡风有联系而被停职反省，又因与金犯的关系而受到审查，从此，陈绪宗更加怀恨在心，和党完全站在对立的方面。当资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻时，陈绪宗暗地喝采。他配合右派，污蔑我们的肃反运动，说“伤害了不少的人”，是搞糟了，他趁机起来为自己翻案，说党不应该审查他。他看了右派分子黄绍竑攻击党的发言后，说：“我认为黄绍竑关于法制问题的言论很对。”他还到金怀瑾哥哥处去点火，煽动他起来为金犯翻案。反右派斗争开始后，陈又为右派分子开脱，说刘宾雁、林希翎不是右派；说右派分子谭惕吾的发言，“还能自圆其说”。
    陈绪宗出身于大资产阶级家庭，入党以后，并没有脱胎换骨改造自己。进城以后，他和出身于大资产阶级家庭的金怀瑾结了婚。他的资产阶级母亲和他住在一起，现在每年能拿六千多元的定息。陈绪宗利用这项钱买了房子，等候金犯回来一起享用。陈身为共产党员，对资产阶级生活方式，对靠定息剥削养家，已经习以为常，不以为耻了。正是由于他已完全蜕化变质，所以他向人说：“这两年来，我积累了三条经验：一、真正的同志难得一个；二、信任是虚伪的，本领是真实的；三、人是复杂的，天真不得。”工作人员们指出，陈绪宗的这些谬论，完全是资产阶级的人生哲学，是对党和新社会的极端恶毒的污蔑。陈绪宗已彻头彻尾成为资产阶级中的反动分子，成为反革命、右派分子在党内的代言人。
