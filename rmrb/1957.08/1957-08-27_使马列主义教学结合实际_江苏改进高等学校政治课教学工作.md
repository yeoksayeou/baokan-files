Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Jiangsu Province is actively researching and preparing to improve the teaching of political theory courses in various universities, to further integrate Marxist-Leninist teaching with practice.

Jiangsu Province's fifteen universities have a teaching staff of more than two hundred political theory teachers. They have made great achievements in publicizing Marxism-Leninism, but also have shortcomings of being divorced from reality. Since the anti-Rightist struggle, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has studied this situation, and made a decision in mid-July that the political courses of various universities will focus on criticizing right-wing viewpoints next semester, and carry out a socialist political thought education movement among students. The Provincial Party Committee also held a meeting of university party committee secretaries and party member presidents and vice presidents to make preliminary arrangements. The Provincial Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education held a training class for political teachers from the end of July to mid-August, concentrating more than 220 teachers of Marxist-Leninist courses from universities throughout the province for study, preparing for the political courses in the next semester. In this training class, the Provincial Party Committee Secretary and relevant ministers of the Provincial Party Committee gave lectures. In addition to conveying and organizing the study of relevant central directives and documents, the class also conducted in-depth research through reports and group discussions, combined with the current anti-Rightist struggle situation in the local area. The training class also organized forces to compile a preliminary draft of teaching outlines for the next semester in various schools, in response to the right-wing fallacies that have been exposed throughout the province. Recently, the Provincial Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education also prepared to transfer a group of political course teachers to rural areas to participate in socialist ideological education work, to further cultivate and train them in actual struggle.

Currently, Marxist-Leninist political course teachers in various schools are continuing to participate in the anti-Rightist struggle, while collecting relevant materials and specifically compiling political course teaching materials.

　　江苏改进高等学校政治课教学工作
    据新华社南京电　江苏省积极研究和准备改进各高等学校政治理论课教学工作，使马列主义教学进一步结合实际。
    江苏省十五所高等院校有一支二百多人的政治理论课教师队伍，在宣传马列主义方面取得很大的成绩，但也存在脱离实际的缺点。反右派斗争以来，中共江苏省委研究了这一情况，于7月中旬作出决定，下学期各院校政治课以批判右派论点为主，在学生中开展社会主义政治思想教育运动。省委还召开了高等院校党委书记和党员院校长会议，作了初步部署。省委文教部于7月底到8月中举办了政治教员训练班，集中全省高等院校马列主义课的教师二百二十多人进行学习，准备下学期的政治课程。这个训练班，由省委书记和省委有关部长等担任讲授，除传达并组织学习中央的有关指示文件外，并结合当地当前反右派斗争形势，通过报告和小组讨论进行了深入研究。训练班还组织力量，针对全省已揭发出来的右派谬论，编写出下学期各校参考性的讲授提纲初稿。最近省委文教部还准备抽调一批政治课教师到农村去参加社会主义思想教育工作，在实际斗争中进一步加以培养训练。
    现在，各校马列主义政治课教师正在一面继续参加反右派斗争，一面收集有关资料，具体编写政治课教材。
