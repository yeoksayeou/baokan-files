    (Our dispatch) According to Wenhui Bao news: Recently, two precious Taiping Heavenly Kingdom printed editions were discovered in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province: "Imperially Approved Regulations for the Scholar Class" and "Imperially Approved Veritable Records of Military Camps." Both books are unique copies in the country. "Imperially Approved Regulations for the Scholar Class" contains the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's rules for the imperial examination selection process, examination hall regulations, as well as systems for ranks, attire, and other matters. "Imperially Approved Veritable Records of Military Camps" contains poems and essays written by Hong Rengan when he was ordered to expedite troops and passed through Zhejiang and Anhui. Most of them are insights into human nature and criticisms of worldly customs, expressing Hong's thoughts and ideas. (Zhang Conggan)

    两本珍贵的太平天国刻本
    本报讯　据文汇报消息：最近江苏省常熟县发现了两本太平天国的珍贵刻本：“钦定士阶条例”和“钦定军次实录”。这两本书都是国内孤本。“钦定士阶条例”载太平天国科举考选规程、试场条例以及品级章服等制度。“钦定军次实录”是洪仁玕奉旨催兵，路经浙徽途次所作诗文，其中多系对性理的见解，针时贬俗之论，表达了洪之思想与主张。　（张从淦）
