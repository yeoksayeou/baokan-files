    Watching the Growth of People's Soldiers on the Screen
    Shu Lu
    The "Film Exhibition Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, began on August 1st. The artistic films "Growing Up in Battle" and "The Eve of Fierce Battle," which are participating in this exhibition, are new productions of the August First Film Studio. These two films focus on depicting the growth of the people's soldiers and the heroic achievements of the People's Liberation Army guarding the national defense front line, and are important gifts to the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of "August 1st" Army Day.
    "Growing Up in Battle" was originally a popular drama, and after being adapted into a film by the original author, Comrade Hu Ke, it is not only more compact than the drama, but also makes a deeper and more realistic depiction in terms of art. At the same time, many of the actors who participated in the performance were comrades from the Anti-Enemy Drama Troupe who won awards at the National Drama Festival. They are well-trained and experienced drama actors, so they added a distinct color to the characters in the film. Directors Yan Jizhou and Sun Min, although new soldiers on the film front, appear to be good soldiers who painstakingly study artistic creation, judging from the film's artistic creation.
    "Growing Up in Battle" profoundly exposes the cruel exploitation and oppression suffered by Chinese peasants under the feudal system, and points out that striving for liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party is their only path. It is a work with strong generalizing power and is very moving. The film overcomes the limitations of stage performances in dramas and showcases the struggle of the people to strive for their own liberation from a broad social life. The Zhao Tiezhu family, the protagonist of the film, is an epitome of hundreds of millions of Chinese peasant families; Zhao Lao Zhong, the older generation of Zhao Tiezhu, is a typical pure peasant. He hates the oppression and bullying of the feudal system. He hopes to resist the exploitation of the landlords through legal struggles, but under the landlord's regime, the peasants have nowhere to appeal their grievances. In a dark society, the industrious Zhao Lao Zhong is finally forced to death by the landlord. This experience is a depiction of the bitter and tragic encounters of the vast number of peasants over thousands of years. Zhao Tiezhu is a young peasant with backbone. He hates the landlord's tyranny. His initial resistance is personal revenge. Therefore, after his father is forced to death, he goes to burn the landlord's house, but this cannot destroy the foundation of the feudal system, so he has to escape his hometown and wander around. Only after he joined the Eighth Route Army did he truly get saved and receive education and training. His wife and son also lived an inhuman life in the enemy-occupied area, and finally his son was forced to join the Eighth Route Army. During the battle to liberate Taiyuan, the father and son met by chance. At this time, the father was already a battalion commander who had experienced many battles, and the son was the battalion commander's communications soldier. The son hoped to become a commando member to liberate his hometown, but the father educated him to abide by discipline, obey orders, and educate him to understand the relationship between personal hatred and class hatred. From Zhao Tiezhu, we can see the growth process of the people's soldiers. The story ends with a family reunion after the victory of the battle. The son found his mother, the mother recognized her father, and the father newly recognized his son. From the film, we can see that due to the advancement of the times, the three generations of an ordinary peasant family have different experiences, and we can also see how the people's soldiers truly grow up in battle under the education of the Party. This is a film with historical educational significance. Especially on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the army, reviewing this historical lesson and recalling the arduous struggle we have gone through will further strengthen our will to build socialism. The bourgeois rightists are plotting to seize the fruits of the people's victory, attempting to alienate the relationship between the Party and the people by means of slander and rumors. However, history is the witness, and the social life reflected in the film is the witness. The people have recognized that the Communist Party is the savior, and the people will never be deceived by these lies.
    In terms of artistic creation, the film "Growing Up in Battle" has a very strong appeal in some places due to the serious and meticulous style of the directors, actors, photographers, and other creators. For example, Zhao Tiezhu and his wife burning paper in front of their father's grave evoked Zhao Tiezhu's memories of his father's last words; the separation of the husband and wife, the child sleeping sweetly; the family being separated and displaced, Tiezhu wearing out his shoes and putting on the shoes his wife gave him before leaving... Such tragic scenes deeply attracted the audience, making them unknowingly shed tears of sympathy. The film reveals the irrefutable truth through such realistic life descriptions: only by following the Communist Party to carry out armed struggle can the oppressed and exploited working people be completely liberated; and the people's soldiers grow up in such struggles.
    "The Eve of Fierce Battle" is a story about the People's Liberation Army and the people on the Fujian front working together to defend the motherland's coastal defense. The story of the film unfolds through a group of US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents plotting to seize intelligence on the military deployment of our Haima Island. There is Sun Yamei, a professional agent who has received specialized training at the Sino-American Cooperation Organization, Chen Fengzhai, a former anti-communist executioner and hidden gang leader, and Lin Meifang, a female agent who sells her youth. They hate the people and vainly try to re-establish the dark rule of the US-Chiang Kai-shek regime. However, Lu Weizhi, the reconnaissance section chief of the People's Liberation Army, and Zhou Jie, a female staff member of the People's Government working group, relied on the broad masses of the people, and finally, on the eve of their launching an aggressive war, they uncovered this vicious conspiracy, arrested these cunning agents, and guaranteed full preparation and reinforcement for the defensive battle of Haima Island. Through the contradictions between the US-Chiang Kai-shek agents, this film very truthfully exposes the ambition of US imperialism to occupy Taiwan for a long time and attempt to rule the world. At the same time, it also describes how the female agent Lin Meifang sold her youth, and carried out various temptations and deceptions to Li, a staff officer of our troops who had lost vigilance, hoping to obtain the military situation of Haima Island from his hands, but this conspiracy was seen through by Lu Weizhi and Zhou Jie, and educated Li, who was paralyzed and blindly pursuing love life. The image of Lu Weizhi and Zhou Jie, who are positively depicted in this film, are very touching, showing their wit and bravery in fighting the enemy on the invisible front in order to defend the motherland's coastal defense. Zhou Jie bravely jumped into the sea to capture the enemy agents; the enemy agents killed the captured agents in order to silence them, cutting off reconnaissance clues, which caused Zhou Jie pain, etc. These shots fully demonstrated the patriotic enthusiasm of this young female staff worker. Although she did not have much experience in fighting the enemy, she had a pure heart and a brave character. Lu Weizhi is an extraordinary person. He tirelessly fights the enemy. His distinction between the enemy and ourselves is clear. As for Li, even though Li fell into a charming love affair and could not extricate himself, even though Li became impulsive and his attitude towards him was very bad, he always solemnly and patiently helped Li, and used facts to educate him to recognize the seriousness of his mistakes. In the film, Lu Weizhi cleverly organized a tense scene to let Li see the other side of Lin Meifang, which is a very interesting arrangement and performance.
    The film introduces the unity of the military and civilians on our coastal defense front through some characters headed by Lu Weizhi, and reflects that the sincere unity of the People's Liberation Army and the people is an invincible force for defending the motherland's socialist construction and defending the motherland's coastal defense. At the same time, it also shows that we must be highly vigilant against the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism.
    On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the "August 1st" Army Day, the screening of these two films is particularly meaningful, because they introduce to the audience the two important historical periods of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the War of Liberation in which the People's Liberation Army grew up in battle, and also introduce the struggle life of the People's Liberation Army in the era of defending the motherland's peaceful construction. Although the films still have some shortcomings, such as the use of film techniques is not yet proficient, and the performances of individual actors are still somewhat superficial, but from the artistic expression of the entire film, they have completed the task of enlightening and educating the audience through images.

    从银幕上看人民战士的成长
    舒路
    由文化部与中国人民解放军总政治部联合主办的“纪念中国人民解放军建军三十周年电影展览”已在8月1日开始举行。参加这一次展览的艺术片“战斗里成长”与“激战前夜”，是八一电影制片厂的新出品。这两部影片集中地描写了人民战士的成长和守卫在国防前线的人民解放军的英雄业绩，是纪念“八一”建军三十周年给广大军民观众重要的献礼。
    “战斗里成长”本来是一个受广大观众欢迎的话剧，经过原作者胡可同志改编为电影，不仅比话剧紧凑，而且在艺术上作了更深刻更真实的描写；同时参加演出的许多演员都是全国话剧会演得奖的抗敌话剧团的同志们，他们是有修养有经验的话剧演员，因此为影片中的人物形象，增加了鲜明的色彩。导演严寄洲、孙民二同志，虽是电影战线上的新战士，但从影片的艺术创作上看来，他们也是刻苦钻研的好战士。
    “战斗里成长”深刻地揭露了我国农民所遭受的封建制度的残酷剥削和压迫，指出了在共产党领导下争取解放是他们唯一的道路，是一部概括力很强又非常感人的作品。影片克服了话剧在舞台上演出的限制，从广阔的社会生活中，展示了人民争取自己解放的斗争图景。影片主人公赵铁柱的一家，是数亿中国农民家庭的缩影；老一辈子的赵铁柱的父亲赵老忠，是纯朴农民的典型。他痛恨封建制度的压迫和欺侮，他希望通过合法的斗争，去反抗地主的压榨，可是在地主的政权统治下，农民的冤是无处申诉的。在暗无天日的社会里，勤劳的赵老忠终于被地主活活地逼死。这样的遭遇，正是几千年来广大农民苦难悲惨的遭遇的写照。赵铁柱是一个有骨气的青年农民，他痛恨地主的专横，他最初的反抗，是个人的复仇，因此，当他父亲被逼死之后，他就去烧地主的房子，但是这不能摧毁封建制度的基础，因而他不能不逃出故乡，四处流浪。只有在他参加了八路军以后，他才真的得了救，得到了教育和锻炼。他的妻子和儿子在敌占区，也过着非人的生活，最后儿子也被逼得去参加八路军了。在解放太原的战役中，父子们偶然相遇，这时父亲已是身经百战的营长，儿子是营长的通讯员。儿子盼望成为突击队员去解放自己的家乡，而父亲却教育他要遵守纪律，服从命令，教育他要认识个人仇恨和阶级仇恨之间的关系。从赵铁柱身上，我们就可以看出人民战士的成长过程。故事是在战斗胜利之后家庭大团圆中结束的。儿子找到了母亲，母亲认出了父亲，父亲从新认识了儿子。从影片里面，我们看到由于时代在前进，使得一个普通的农民家庭三代人有着不同遭遇，也使我们看到人民战士在党的教育下，如何在战斗里真正地成长起来。这是一部有历史教育意义的影片，特别是在建军三十周年的今天，来重温这历史课程，来回忆我们所走过的艰苦奋斗的道路，会更加坚定我们建设社会主义的意志。资产阶级右派分子阴谋夺取人民胜利的果实，企图以污蔑、造谣中伤来离间党和人民之间的关系，可是历史是见证人，影片所反映的社会生活是见证人，人民已经认清了共产党是救星，人民决不会为这些谎言所蒙蔽。
    影片“战斗里成长”在艺术创作上由于导演、演员、摄影师和其他创作人员的严肃细致的作风，使得影片中有些地方感染力非常强烈，如赵铁柱夫妻在爹的坟前烧纸，引起赵铁柱对爹的遗言的回忆；夫妻二人的离别，孩子在甜睡；一家人天各一方流离失所，铁柱走破了鞋换上妻子临走送他的鞋……等等悲剧场面，深深吸引着观众，使观众每每激动得不知不觉流下同情的眼泪来。影片就是通过这样逼真的生活描写，揭示出无可辩驳的真理：被压迫被剥削的劳动人民，只有跟着共产党进行武装斗争，才能得到彻底的解放；而人民战士也就是在这样的斗争中成长起来的。
    “激战前夜”是表现福建前线人民解放军和人民在一起，保卫祖国海防的故事。影片故事是通过一群美蒋特务阴谋夺取我海马岛军事部署的情报而展开的。这里有在中美合作所受过专门训练的职业特务孙亚美，有曾经是反共刽子手、暗藏的黑帮头子陈封斋，有出卖青春的女特务林美芳。他们仇视人民，妄想重新建立美蒋黑暗的统治。然而人民解放军的侦察科长鲁维智，人民政府的工作组的女工作员周洁，依靠了广大的人民，终于在他们发动侵略战争的前夜，破获了这个恶毒的阴谋，逮捕了这些狡猾的特务分子，保证了对海马岛防御战斗的充分准备和增援。这部影片通过美蒋特务之间的矛盾，非常真实地暴露出美帝国主义企图长期霸占台湾和企图统治全世界的野心。同时也描写了女特务林美芳如何出卖自己的青春，向部队失去警惕的李参谋进行种种引诱欺骗，希望从他的手上得到海马岛的军事情况，可是这个阴谋为鲁维智和周洁识破了，教育了麻痹大意一味追求恋爱生活的李参谋。这部影片所正面描写的鲁维智和周洁为保卫祖国海防，在无形的战线上和敌人作战的机智勇敢的形象，是十分感人的。周洁勇敢地跳入大海去捕捉敌特；敌特为了灭口杀死了被俘的特务，切断了侦察线索，引起周洁的痛苦等镜头，都充分表现出了这个青年女工作人员的爱国热情，虽然她对敌斗争经验不多，但她有纯洁的心灵和勇敢的性格。鲁维智是一个不平常的人，他不知疲倦地和敌人进行斗争，他的敌我界线是分明的，对李参谋，尽管李参谋坠入了迷人的情网而不能自拔，尽管李参谋冲动起来对他的态度很不好，而他总是严正地耐心地帮助李参谋，用事实教育他认识自己的错误的严重性。影片中鲁维智巧妙地组织了一场紧张的戏，让李参谋看看另一面的林美芳，这是非常有趣的安排和表现。
    影片通过以鲁维智为首的一些人物，来介绍我海防前线军民的团结一致，反映人民解放军和人民的精诚团结是保卫祖国社会主义建设，保卫祖国海防的不可战胜的力量，同时也说明了对于美帝国主义的侵略阴谋一定要提高警惕。
    在“八一”建军三十周年纪念的时候，这两部影片的放映是特别有意义的，因为它们向观众介绍了人民解放军在战斗里成长的抗日战争和解放战争两个重要的历史时代，也介绍了人民解放军在保卫祖国和平建设时代的斗争生活。尽管影片还存在着一些缺点，如电影技巧运用还不熟练，个别演员的表演还表面化一些，但是从整个影片的艺术表现来说，它们是完成了通过形象去启发教育观众的任务的。
