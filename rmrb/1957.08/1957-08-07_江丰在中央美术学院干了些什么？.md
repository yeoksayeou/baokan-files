In the big-character posters denouncing rightists newly posted at the Central Academy of Fine Arts these days, there is one that reads: "Is Jiang Feng's anti-Party problem a tragedy?" Now, from the exposure of many teachers and students, we get a definite answer: this is not a tragedy.

A "Left" Face
A Rightist Soul

Since Jiang Feng took office as the Vice President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in 1951, and acting president after the death of President Xu Beihong, he has consistently appeared with a "leftist" face. Some people even think that he is the "incarnation" of the Party in the Academy of Fine Arts. In this anti-rightist struggle, Jiang Feng's disguise was stripped off, fully exposing him as an anti-Party ambitious person who has long refused the leadership of the Party and resisted the Party's literary and art policies. He often spread dissatisfaction with the leadership of the Ministry of Culture among the masses. During the rectification campaign, he used the Party Branch of the Academy of Fine Arts to launch an anti-Party climax, attempting to overthrow the Party leadership of the Ministry of Culture. When the Party Group of the Ministry of Culture and the Party Group of the Artists Association jointly held a forum for people in the art circle in late May, Jiang Feng launched behind-the-scenes activities with ulterior motives. He convened secret meetings at the Central Academy of Fine Arts with his cronies and some professors he had deceived, planning to attack the Party and systematically carried out deployment and division of labor. Jiang Feng also said: "This is the final battle." Through his deployment, someone at the forum clamored that "some comrades of the Party Group of the Ministry of Culture and the Party Group of the Artists Association formed sectarianism to frame Jiang Feng." Jiang Feng's cronies also accused the People's Daily of criticizing the report of Jiang Feng's exclusion of traditional Chinese painting, and even clamored to examine the reporter's history and political background. After the meeting, Jiang Feng and others believed that the People's Daily could not fully reflect their "opinions" and advocated publishing the full record of the forum in the Wenhui Daily, and printing more than 400 copies of the record to distribute to the national art circles in order to provoke greater "storms" and confront the Ministry of Culture. At the same time, Jiang Feng not only supported the anti-Party activities of the right-wing group of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, but also supported the right-wing elements in the sculpture factory located in the academy in their attack on the Party. Usually, he rarely went to the students' dormitories, but now he suddenly expressed "concern" for the students. He once took the initiative to run to the dormitory to instigate vigorously, asking the students to fire at the Ministry of Culture at the forum and defend his own mistakes. On a school anniversary, he incited alumni to say that in the future, they should not rely on the Ministry of Culture, and students could establish a friendship association, located in the Central Academy of Fine Arts, to help alumni professionalize. At the meeting, he especially advocated the benefits of Wang Zhijie, a graduate who was not at ease with the government's unified job allocation, as a professional painter, confusing right and wrong and causing ideological confusion among the students.

Treating Chinese Painters with Sectarianism
Treating Chinese Painting with Nihilism

Jiang Feng used his power as acting president in the Central Academy of Fine Arts to resist the Party's policy of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions of national art for a long time, spreading fallacies such as that traditional Chinese painting is "unscientific", "backward" and "cannot express real life", discriminating against Chinese painters, excluding Chinese painting, and creating a kind of chaotic thinking in the academy. Students were unwilling to learn Chinese painting, and teachers were unwilling to teach Chinese painting, which put the academy's color-ink painting (that is, Chinese painting) department in a state of dying. In the spring of 1956, he further proposed a teaching plan to "improve" the color-ink painting department, borrowing the ancient saying "learning from the ancients is not as good as learning from nature", excessively and mechanically emphasizing that students learn sketching and painting mainly with figures, expressing life, and believing that the traditional method of learning painting in Chinese painting is imitation, which is a "stereotype" and "rigid rules". Landscape paintings and flower-and-bird paintings are "meaningless". He even forced Li Kuchan, a freehand flower-and-bird painter who had been engaged in Chinese painting teaching for more than 20 years, to engage in figure sketching. Some teachers also reflected that they encountered "all kinds of difficulties and could not move an inch" when studying the national art heritage. As a result, the students who were trained lacked the knowledge of Chinese painting and the cultivation of traditional techniques. Last year, after the Ministry of Culture discovered these problems, it instructed the academy leaders that the teaching of Chinese painting should be inclusive, with sketching, and imitation methods should also be adopted. Not only figures should be painted, but also flowers, birds, and landscapes. However, Jiang Feng refused to do so on the grounds of maintaining the "style" of the color-ink painting department. Under the guidance of Jiang Feng's wrong thinking, the National Art Research Institute affiliated to the academy changed the original plan of the Ministry of Culture for this research institute to inherit and carry forward the tradition of national art and unite Chinese painters. The preparation has not been formally established for four years, and more than 20 researchers and Chinese painters who were originally hired were excluded from the "door", only doing some data work, and letting a professor he trusted compile art history. Last April, when the Party Group of the Ministry of Culture criticized Jiang Feng's nihilistic attitude towards Chinese painting and his sectarian emotions towards Chinese painters, Jiang Feng not only refused to correct his mistakes, but also spread rumors inside and outside the Party, saying: "The leading comrades of the Party Group of the Ministry of Culture and some comrades of the Party Group of the Artists Association formed a sectarian group to frame and attack Jiang Feng, and exclude new Chinese painting and oil painting", provoking more people's dissatisfaction with the Party leadership of the Ministry of Culture. Later, Premier Zhou criticized Jiang Feng's mistake of not attaching importance to Chinese painting, but Jiang Feng did not accept this correct criticism. This April, the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee learned that Jiang Feng and Mo Pu (former vice president of the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts) had serious errors in implementing the Party's literary and art policies, and instructed Jiang Feng and Mo Pu to go to Hangzhou for inspection. Jiang Feng delayed again and again and did not go. He also clamored that my problem cannot be solved within the Party, and must be solved among the masses.

Refusing the Party's "Double Hundred" Policy

Jiang Feng opposed the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend". He spread remarks in the Central Academy of Fine Arts, saying: "The policy of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend' is not suitable for our academy." After his anti-Party remarks were issued, he was afraid of being refuted by others, so he looked for a theoretical basis for himself. He said: In the past, "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was not mentioned, but now it is advocated, which shows that the Party's policies can also be opposed. In the academy, he hung up the banner of adhering to socialist realism and put forward the so-called "revolutionary school" to resist the Party's "Double Hundred" policy. Jiang Feng not only advocated that only one school of thought contend on the issue of Chinese painting, but also did so on the issue of oil painting. He opposed views different from his own and excluded people who held different views. This spring, the Central Academy of Fine Arts held a discussion on Impressionism (a bourgeois school in oil painting). Many professors and painters expressed their views on this issue, and they all believed that this was a new atmosphere that had emerged in the academy since the Party advocated "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend". However, Jiang Feng was very dissatisfied with this. At the discussion, he appeared with a "leftist" face, shouting: "Different views on Impressionism reflect the 'chaos' in artistic thinking, and illustrate the 'decline' in the spirit of realism." After he spoke, some painters admitted that they could no longer speak, because Jiang Feng had already made a conclusion. At that time, the Xinhua News Agency reporter reported that the discussion asked him to review the manuscript, but he rudely only allowed the reporter to report his views, insulting the professors who held opposing views in the discussion, and declared that although his views were similar to those of Chen Qitong and others, the People's Daily's criticism of Chen Qitong was not necessarily correct, and in seven or eight years, Chen Qitong would still overturn the case. He also said: "I used to agree with Chen Qitong, but now, my head is not a lantern and will not sway with the wind." When he conveyed Chairman Mao's speech at the Central Propaganda Work Conference in the academy, he intentionally distorted Chairman Mao's words. In another place, he slandered the Party's policies and said: "In the past, it was always emphasized that workers, peasants and soldiers can only write about workers, peasants and soldiers and cannot write about anything else. I disagree. Now it is also advocated to diversify the subjects, because Chairman Mao has spoken. This kind of leadership only looks at the top and does not look at the bottom. This is the dark side."

Disregarding Students' Political Life

Jiang Feng denied the Party's leading role in the school and advocated the implementation of the "one-chief system". He said: "I don't agree with the school's Party committee system, and I won't implement the Party committee system." Therefore, the Party committee system has not been established in the Central Academy of Fine Arts until now. In leading the school work, Jiang Feng detached himself from politics and despised students' political and ideological education. He openly said that students in the school now mainly learn professional skills, and they can also paint well without learning Marxism-Leninism. If students do not learn professional skills and technology well, they will not be able to make a living in the future. His remarks have had a very bad influence on students. When teachers ask students to attend political classes, some students take out Jiang Feng's words as a shield. Jiang Feng also proposed that political classes should be arranged without affecting the study of professional courses. Therefore, political classes were placed in the evening for a period of time (students generally do not paint in the evening), and students were dozing off during political classes. Last year, he unilaterally decided to cancel the academy's course on "History of the Chinese Revolution". He said: "There is nothing to talk about. Students can study independently and give full play to independent thinking." When the academy carried out the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents, he said: "There is nothing to learn from the Eighth National Congress" documents, it is the same old stuff.

At present, teachers and students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts are continuing to criticize Jiang Feng's anti-Party problem.

    江丰在中央美术学院干了些什么？
    新华社记者　王孔诚　孙世恺
    在中央美术学院这些天新贴的反右派斗争的大字报中，有一张这样写着：“江丰的反党问题是不是悲剧？”现在，从许多教师和学生的揭露得到一个肯定的回答：这不是悲剧。
    “左”的面孔
    右的灵魂
    江丰从1951年任中央美术学院副院长，徐悲鸿院长逝世后代理院长职务，他一贯以“左”的面貌出现，有些人甚而认为他在美术学院就是党的“化身”。在这次反右派斗争中，剥开了江丰的外衣，充分地暴露出他是一个长期拒绝党的领导，反抗党的文艺政策的反党野心家。他经常在群众中散布对文化部领导的不满情绪。在整风期间，他利用美术学院党总支掀起了一次反党的高潮，企图打垮文化部党的领导。当5月下旬文化部党组和美协党组联合召开美术界人士座谈会时，江丰就别有用心地展开了幕后活动，在中央美术学院召集亲信和被他蒙蔽的一些教授开秘密会议，策划向党进攻，有计划有准备地进行了部署和分工。江丰还说：“这是最后的战斗”。通过他的部署在座谈会上竟有人叫嚣，说：“文化部和美协的党组一部分同志结成宗派主义陷害江丰。”江丰的亲信还指责人民日报批评江丰排斥国画的报道，甚而扬言要审查记者的历史和政治背景。会后，江丰等认为人民日报不能充分反映他们的“意见”，主张在文汇报上发表那次座谈会的全部记录，并把记录打印了四百多份要分发到全国美术界去，以便挑起更大的“风波”，对抗文化部。同时，江丰不仅支持中央工艺美术学院右派集团的反党活动，也支持设在学院内的雕塑工厂右派分子向党的进攻。平素他很少到学生宿舍去，现在也突然对学生表示“关心”起来。他曾主动跑到宿舍去大肆煽动，要学生们到座谈会上向文化部开火，为他自己的错误辩解。在一个校庆日，他煽动校友说，将来不要靠文化部，学生可以成立联谊会，设在中央美术学院，帮助校友职业化。他在会上特别鼓吹不安心于从政府统一分配工作的毕业生汪志杰作职业画家的好处，混淆是非，引起学生的思想混乱。
    以宗派主义对待国画家
    以虚无主义对待国画
    江丰在中央美术学院利用他代理院长的职权，长期抗拒党提出的继承和发扬民族美术优良传统的政策，散布国画“不科学”、“落后”和“不能表现现实生活”等谬论，歧视国画家、排斥国画，在学院里造成一种混乱思想，学生不肯学国画，教员不愿教国画，使学院的彩墨画（即国画）系长期处在奄奄一息的状态中。他在1956年春进一步提出“改进”彩墨画系教学方案，假借古人所说“师古人不如师造化”的论点，过分而且机械地强调学生学素描和画画以人物为主，表现生活，认为国画传统上学画方法的临摹是“陈套”是“清规戒律”。山水画、花鸟画没“意思”。甚而强逼从事国画教学二十多年的写意花鸟画家李苦禅，去搞人物写生。有的教员也反映在学习民族美术遗产时，受到“百般刁难，寸步难行”。以至影响培养出来的学生，缺乏国画的知识和传统技法的修养。去年文化部发现这些问题后就指示学院领导，在国画教学上应兼容并包，有素描，也应采取临摹方法，不光要画人物，也应有花鸟、山水，可是江丰却以保持彩墨画系的“风格”为理由加以拒绝。附属在学院的民族美术研究所在江丰的错误思想指导下，改变了文化部原订这个研究所继承和发扬民族美术传统、团结国画家的方案，筹备四年至今未正式成立，把原聘请的二十多位研究员国画家排斥在“门外”，仅搞些资料工作，让他所信任的一位教授去编美术史。去年4月，文化部党组批评江丰对国画的虚无主义态度和对国画家的宗派主义情绪时，江丰不仅拒不改正错误，反而在党内外散布流言说：“文化部党组领导同志和美协党组一部分同志结成宗派集团，陷害和打击江丰，排斥新国画和油画”，挑拨更多人对文化部党领导的不满。后来，周总理批评了江丰不重视国画的错误，但江丰并不接受这一正确的批评。今年4月，党中央领导同志了解到江丰、莫朴（前中央美术学院华东分院副院长）执行党的文艺政策有严重错误，曾指示江丰、莫朴去杭州进行检查。江丰却一拖再拖不去。他还嚣张地说，我的问题在党内解决不了，一定要到群众中去解决。拒绝党的“百家争鸣”政策
    江丰反对党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策。他在中央美术学院里散布言论说：“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策不适合于我们学院。他的这种反党言论发出后，怕遭受到别人的反驳，于是又为自己寻找理论根据。他说：过去不提百花齐放，百家争鸣，而现在提倡了，足见党的政策也可以反对的。他在学院里，挂起坚持社会主义现实主义的幌子，提出什么“革命学派”来抵制党的“百家争鸣”政策。江丰不仅在国画的问题上主张一家独鸣，而且在对待油画的问题上也是如此，他反对和自己不同的看法以及排斥持有不同看法的人。今年春天，中央美术学院举行了有关印象主义（一种油画上的资产阶级流派）的讨论。许多教授、画家都发表了自己对这一问题的看法，并且都认为这是党提倡“百花齐放、百家争鸣”以来在学院中出现的一种新气象。可是江丰却对此大为不满。在讨论会上他以“左”的面貌出现，嚷道：“对印象主义的不同看法，反映了艺术思想上的‘混乱’，说明了现实主义精神上的‘衰退’”。他讲话之后，有些画家就承认自己不能再发言了，因为江丰已经作了结论。当时，新华社记者报道那次讨论会请他审查稿子，他竟然粗暴的只准许记者报道他的观点，辱骂在讨论中和自己持有相反看法的教授，并宣称他的看法和陈其通等人虽然差不多，可是人民日报对陈其通的批评也不见得正确，再过七、八年，陈其通还是会翻案的。他还说：“我过去是同意陈其通的，现在，我的脑袋不是灯笼也不会随风摆。”他在学院内传达毛主席在中央宣传工作会议上的讲话时，竟把毛主席的话有意的加以歪曲。他在另一个地方，又诬蔑党的政策说：“过去一直强调工农兵，只能写工农兵不能写别的，我就不同意。现在也提倡题材多样化了，因为毛主席说了话，这种领导，只看上面，不看下面，这是阴暗的一面。”
    漠视学生政治生活
    江丰否定党在学校中的领导作用，主张实行“一长制”。他说：“我是不同意学校搞党委制的，我就不搞党委制。”所以，中央美术学院至今未建立起党委制。江丰在领导学校工作中，脱离政治、轻视学生的政治思想教育。他公开说，现在学生在学校中主要是学业务的，不学马列主义同样也能画好画。如果学生学不好业务和技术，将来职业化了，学生就吃不上饭。他的这种论调在学生中造成很坏的影响。当教员要求学生上政治课时，有的学生就拿出江丰的话来作挡箭牌。江丰还提出政治课要在不影响业务课的学习下进行安排。所以，政治课有一个时期被放在晚上（一般的晚上学生们不画画），学生们在上政治课的时候直打瞌睡。去年，他竟然一手决定取消了学院的“中国革命史”的课程。他说：“没有什么好讲的，同学们可以自学，发挥独立思考。”学院里进行“八大”文件的学习，他说：“八大”文件没有什么好学的，老一套。
    目前，中央美术学院师生正继续对江丰反党问题进行批判。
