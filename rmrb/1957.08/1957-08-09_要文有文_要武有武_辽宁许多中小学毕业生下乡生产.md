    Able in Both Literary and Military Pursuits
    Many Middle and Primary School Graduates in Liaoning Go to the Countryside for Production
    (Our Dispatch) Many graduating middle and primary school students in Liaoning Province are actively responding to the Party's call to dedicate their youth to the countryside. As of July 16th, more than 300 graduating middle and primary school students each in Shenyang and Lüda have volunteered to participate in agricultural production. The farmers of the Qianjin Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang, fearing that the young people who had just started working would be too tired, voluntarily offered to let them work half-days, but they firmly refused, insisting on working all day with the cooperative members. Many students also use their spare time to help illiterate farmers learn to read. The majority of the young students returning to their hometowns in Lüda are children of farmers, such as Song Changying, the head of the life department of the student union of Dalian No. 11 Junior Middle School and a member of the Communist Youth League. Having grown up in the countryside, she took the lead in returning to her hometown, the Dongfanghong Cooperative, with more than a dozen classmates to participate in agricultural production, which was warmly welcomed by the cooperative members. The cooperative assigned them work based on their wishes and assigned experienced farmers as their teachers. The young people unanimously expressed their determination to learn from Xu Jianchun and "work in the countryside for a lifetime," dedicating their knowledge to the countryside.
    According to current statistics, a total of 1,033 graduating middle school students in the Jinzhou area have participated in agricultural production, including 42 high school graduates. Wang Deming, a high school graduate from Xingcheng Middle School, and others went to the fields with the cooperative members to cut sorghum on the second day after returning to the countryside. The old farmers praised them, saying, "These young people are able in both literary and military pursuits, truly remarkable." Some students have already earned more than 100 work points. Many parents, seeing this situation, have also reversed their thinking that participating in agricultural production is not promising.

    要文有文　要武有武
    辽宁许多中小学毕业生下乡生产
    本报讯　辽宁省许多地方的应届中小学毕业生纷纷响应党的号召，要把自己的青春献给农村。到7月16日止，沈阳、旅大市各有三百多名应届中小学毕业生自愿参加农业生产。沈阳市郊区前进社的农民们怕刚参加工作的小伙子们太累，主动让他们干半天活，可是他们坚决不肯，一定要和社员一道整天干活。许多学生还利用业余时间帮助不识字的农民学文化。旅大市青年学生回乡队伍中大部分是农民子女，如大连十一初中学生会的生活部长、共青团员宋长瑛，过去生长在农村，这次带头和十几名同学回到家乡东方红社参加农业生产，受到社员的热烈欢迎。社里根据他们的愿望分配了工作，并派有经验的农民作他们的老师。青年们一致表示要学习徐建春“在农村干一辈子”，把自己的知识献给农村。
    锦州地区据目前统计共有一千零三十三名应届中学毕业生参加了农业生产，其中有四十二人是高中毕业生。兴城中学高中毕业生王德明等回到农村的第二天就和社员们一齐下地割高粱。老农民赞扬说：“小伙子们要文有文，要武有武，真行。”有的学生已干了一百多工分。许多学生家长看到这种情况，也都扭转了认为参加农业生产没出息的思想。
