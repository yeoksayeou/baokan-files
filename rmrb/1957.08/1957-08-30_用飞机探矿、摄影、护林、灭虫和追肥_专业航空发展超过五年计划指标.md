Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 29th. China's specialized aviation industry, which has rapidly developed from scratch since liberation, has begun to take shape and is playing an important role in national construction.

    The head of the specialized aviation team of the Civil Aviation Administration of China told reporters that the actual development of China's specialized aviation industry has far exceeded the targets set by the Five-Year Plan. The flight volume for the first seven months of this year reached 103.3% of the annual target for 1957 in the Five-Year Plan. The four most important businesses of the specialized aviation team, namely airborne geophysical prospecting, aerial photography, aerial forest protection, and agricultural aviation, have all achieved great results.

    The total area covered by airborne prospecting has so far reached more than 888,000 square kilometers. The planned prospecting area for this year alone will reach more than 670,000 square kilometers. Aircraft carrying highly sensitive magnetic prospecting instruments have flown over many regions, including Inner Mongolia and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, for exploration. Currently, prospecting aircraft are flying over North China and the Songliao Plain, preparing to uncover the mystery of the oil reserves in these two large plains. In the past year alone, aircraft have conducted general surveys of dozens of mineral deposits.

    Aerial photography aircraft have provided indispensable data on topography, landforms, and water sources for the Yellow River planning, the Sanmenxia construction, and the development of wasteland in Xinjiang. In the largest desert in China, the Tarim Desert in Xinjiang, aircraft replaced ground personnel who were almost impossible to enter the desert center, and conducted photogrammetric surveying. To date, the total area of aerial photography has reached more than 136,000 square kilometers, and the planned task for this year is more than 159,000 square kilometers. Airborne prospecting and aerial photography are not only effective, but also greatly improve production efficiency.

    The scope of China's specialized aviation services for agricultural production is gradually expanding. Currently, there are seven projects, including eliminating locusts, cotton bollworms, wheat midges, and wheat foliar topdressing experiments. In June of this year, the specialized aviation team dispatched twelve aircraft to eliminate locusts, cotton bollworms, and wheat midges in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Qinghai, Gansu, and other provinces. So far, more than 4.2 million mu of land have been treated to eliminate summer and autumn locusts. According to the experience of the past two years, the use of aircraft to control cotton bollworms has yielded more significant results in terms of both economic value and effectiveness.

    Every spring and autumn, when forests are prone to fire, forest protection aircraft patrol the largest Greater Khingan and Lesser Khingan forest areas in the motherland. Last year, forest protection pilots discovered more than fifty forest fires, directing operations from the air and dropping tools and food to assist ground personnel in extinguishing the forest fires. In many forest areas, aircraft have also conducted aerial surveys of forest density, tree species, reserves, and even tree age.

    China's specialized aviation began in 1952, and the specialized aviation team was officially established in Tianjin in 1955. Next year, the airborne prospecting and aerial photography businesses, which directly serve industrial construction, will be expanded by about one-fold.

### 用飞机探矿、摄影、护林、灭虫和追肥　专业航空发展超过五年计划指标

    用飞机探矿、摄影、护林、灭虫和追肥
　　专业航空发展超过五年计划指标
    新华社天津29日电　解放以后从无到有迅速发展起来的我国专业航空事业，已经初具规模，并在国家建设中发挥了重要作用。
    中国民用航空局专业航空队的负责人告诉记者：我国专业航空事业实际发展的迅速远远超过了五年计划所规定的指标。今年头七个月的飞行量就达到五年计划中1957年全年指标的103.3％。专业航空队最主要的四项业务，即航空物理探矿、航空摄影、空中护林和农业航空都获得巨大的成绩。
    空中探矿的总面积，至今已经完成八十八万八千多平方公里。今年一年的计划探矿面积就达到六十七万多平方公里。载着灵敏度极高的磁测探矿仪器的飞机曾经在内蒙古、长江中下游等许多地区的上空飞行勘探。目前探矿飞机又飞行在华北、松辽平原的上空，准备揭开这两个大平原石油蕴藏之谜。仅去年一年，飞机就普查出了几十处矿藏。
    航空摄影飞机为黄河规划、三门峡建设和新疆荒地的开拓等提供了必不可少的地形、地貌和水源等资料。在全国最大的新疆塔里木沙漠，飞机代替了几乎不可能进入沙漠中心的地面人员，进行了摄影测绘工作。至今，航空摄影总面积已经完成十三万六千多平方公里，今年一年计划任务达十五万九千多平方公里。空中探矿和航空摄影不仅效果良好，而且生产效率大大提高。
    我国专业航空事业为农业生产服务的范围逐步扩大。目前已经有消灭蝗虫、棉虫、小麦吸浆虫以及小麦根外追肥试验等七个项目。今年6月，专业航空队出动了十二架飞机在河北、河南、山东、青海、甘肃等省消灭蝗虫、棉虫和小麦吸浆虫，到现在为止，已经扑灭四百二十多万亩土地上的夏蝗和秋蝗。根据这两年的经验，使用飞机防治棉虫，不论在经济价值和效果上，成绩都更加显著。
    每逢林木容易起火的春秋两季，护林飞机就巡视祖国最大的大、小兴安岭森林区。去年护林飞行员发现五十多处森林起火，在空中指挥和投下工具、粮食，配合地面人员扑灭了林火。在不少林区，飞机还进行了森林密度、树种、储藏量乃至林木年龄等的航空调查。
    我国专业飞行是1952年开始的，1955年在天津正式建立了专业航空队。明年，直接服务于工业建设的航空探矿和航空摄影业务还将扩展一倍左右。
