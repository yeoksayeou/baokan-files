Xinhua News Agency, August 21st—The Chiang Kai-shek clique is planning to set up a concentration camp called the "Overseas Chinese Student Special Training Class" to persecute overseas Chinese students and students from Hong Kong and Macau who have been lured to Taiwan, as recently revealed by the Taiwan Kuomintang newspaper "Youth Warrior Daily."

Overseas Chinese students in Taiwan often oppose the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and resist forced participation in the Chiang army. Following the hunger strike protest by students of Taipei Overseas Chinese High School against the American invasion of Taiwan, another student strike occurred at the end of July. All of this has caused the Chiang Kai-shek clique a deep headache. Recently, Taiwan's "Youth Warrior Daily" leaked the Kuomintang's conspiracy to establish a concentration camp to detain overseas Chinese students in Taiwan. This Kuomintang newspaper said: After overseas Chinese students arrive in Taiwan, the most important thing the Kuomintang authorities should pay attention to is not to let them receive education, "The training problem after overseas Chinese students enter school is the issue we should pay the most attention to." This newspaper said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "way of training is not in empty words. It is useless to strictly control and train them with empty words. There must be a special place to accommodate the overseas Chinese students who violate the rules in various schools…named Overseas Chinese Student Special Training Class." Once overseas Chinese students are sent to this concentration camp, they will lose their freedom and be "controlled and trained" until the Kuomintang secret agents consider their "performance satisfactory," at which point they will be released.

Lu Daowei and two other overseas Chinese students from Taipei Overseas Chinese High School have recently been expelled from school by the Kuomintang authorities due to the student strike. They will become the first victims of the overseas Chinese student concentration camp.

　　蒋介石加紧迫害华侨学生
　　台湾筹设关押华侨学生的集中营
    新华社21日讯　蒋介石集团筹设名为“侨生特别训练班”的集中营，来迫害被诱骗到台湾的华侨学生和香港、澳门学生，这是台湾国民党报纸“青年战士报”最近透露的。
    在台湾的华侨学生常常反对蒋介石集团的黑暗统治和抗拒强迫参加蒋军。台北华侨中学学生继反对美国侵略台湾而举行绝食抗议后，在7月底又发生学潮。这都使蒋介石集团深感头痛。最近，台湾“青年战士报”泄露了国民党酝酿设立集中营关押在台湾的华侨学生的阴谋。这家国民党报纸说：国民党当局在华侨学生到台湾后，最应注意的不是让他们受教育，“侨生入学后的受训问题，才是我们最应注意的问题。”这家报纸说：蒋介石集团对在台湾华侨学生的“受训之道，不在空言。空言严格管训是没有用的，必须对各校犯规的侨生有特别收容之处……名为侨生特别训练班”。华侨学生一被押入这个集中营，就丧失自由，被“管训”到国民党特务认为“成绩满意”时，才加以释放。
    台北华侨中学学生吕道纬等三名华侨学生，最近因学潮事件已经被国民党当局开除学籍。他们将成为华侨学生集中营的第一批受害者。
