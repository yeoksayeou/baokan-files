Uproot the Poisonous Weeds in the Children's Literary Garden

Rightist Chen Zijun's (Head of the Literary Group of the *China Young Pioneers* newspaper, Communist Party member) reactionary statements are a poisonous weed in the children's literary garden.

Chen Zijun fundamentally denies the Party's leadership of literary work. He falsely claims that "Emphasizing literature serving politics and educating the people is one-sided," "Old writers writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers is meaningless," and "I think the standards for criticism, putting politics first, are questionable." He also slanderously claims that "Doctrinairism comes from the Central Committee, from Zhou Yang." "The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League does not understand literature and cannot lead literary publications." He boasted everywhere as a "writer," attempting to usurp the Party's leadership over children's literature. He unscrupulously and indiscriminately attacked the leaders of the Chinese Writers Association's children's literature group, scolding them as "occupying the latrine without defecating." For nearly half a year, he used the tricks of a con man, actively seeking opportunities to prepare for a children's literature coterie publication, proclaiming himself as the deputy editor-in-chief, and openly stating that not wanting the Party's leadership was for "freedom." He started the publication to break away from the Party's leadership and "become a children's literature center."

He slandered the new society as "pitch black." In his eyes, there was no democracy or freedom anywhere, "News is too tightly controlled, too rigidly unified," "There are too many publishing bans," "The factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee is also problematic, the power is too great," "Human rights are not guaranteed"; he also deliberately obliterated the country's construction achievements, saying that "The propaganda of the Changchun Automobile Factory is bragging." He absurdly attributed the emergence of bureaucratism to our national system, saying that "Bureaucratism is not just a matter of ideology, it involves the system." He believes that "It cannot be solved without great democracy."

This rightist element, who came from a landlord family, infiltrated the Party in 1948, but believed that "the Party restricted his freedom," so he consistently stood in opposition to the Party and resisted transforming himself.

    拔除儿童文艺园地的毒草
    右派分子陈子君（中国少年报文艺组组长、共产党员）的反动言论是儿童文艺园地里一支毒草。
    陈子君对党领导的文艺事业，是从根本上否定的。他妄称“强调文学为政治服务、教育人民是片面的”“文艺老写工农兵没什么意思”“我认为批评标准、政治第一，就值得怀疑”。他还诬蔑说什么“教条主义来自中央，来自周扬”。“团中央不懂文学，不能领导文艺刊物”。他以“作家”身份到处吹嘘，想篡夺党对儿童文学的领导权。他不择手段，不分场合地到处打击作协儿童文学组的领导人，骂他们是“占着茅坑不拉屎”。近半年来他用江湖骗子的手法，到处钻空子，积极活动筹办儿童文学同人刊物，自封为副主编，公开表示不要党领导是为了“要自由”，他搞刊物，就是为了摆脱党的领导，另“成为一个儿童文学中心”。
    他诬蔑新社会是“漆黑一团”。在他的眼里到处不民主不自由，“新闻卡得太严，统得太死”“出版禁令条例太多”，“党委领导下的厂长负责制也成问题，权力太大”“人权得不到保证”；他又故意抹煞国家的建设成绩，说什么“长春汽车厂的宣传是吹牛”。他荒谬地把官僚主义的产生归之于我们的国家制度，说什么“官僚主义不仅仅是思想问题，牵扯到制度问题”。他认为“不用大民主就解决不了”。
    这个出身于地主家庭的右派分子，1948年混进党后，却认为“党限制了他的自由”，所以一贯站在同党对立的立场，抗拒改造自己。
