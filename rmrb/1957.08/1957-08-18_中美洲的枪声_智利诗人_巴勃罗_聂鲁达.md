Gunfire in Central America
By Pablo Neruda, Chilean Poet

In 1949, the President of Guatemala was a democrat, Dr. Juan José Arévalo. He received me in his office. He was a tall, generous, and affable man. From the windows of the presidential palace, one could see the bright rooftops of the capital. Everything in the room was orderly; it was the office of a methodical and meticulous man.

But what surprised me were the small holes on the wall a few centimeters above Dr. Arévalo's head. The presidential hall was so neat, but this part of the wall was neglected and not repaired, which seemed very strange. My eyes couldn't help but stare at this imperfection.

"Those are American bullets," Dr. Arévalo noticed my curiosity and explained to me. "I deliberately kept it as it is, as a perpetual warning to myself." President Arévalo suppressed more than thirty rebellions; the rebellions were instigated by the United Fruit Company, an American monopoly organization that conducted business and political conspiracies in all Central American countries.

Soon after, a new wave of American bullets destroyed many lives and crushed this small democratic country.

An American magazine recently published a series of sensational articles written by a professional journalist, presented as memoirs dictated by Allen Dulles, the brother of the infamous American Secretary of State, who, like his brother, held a high position in the American government. Allen Dulles was the head of American espionage worldwide.

These articles revealed how Dulles planned and executed the "Guatemalan Campaign." Mr. Dulles bribed a small Guatemalan military officer, supplied him with weapons and money, and supported him to become the dictator of Guatemala. Airplanes taking off from American bases in Panama suffocated the desire for independence in blood and fire. Mr. Dulles was triumphant with a temporary victory. This sense of triumph overflowed in his conversation with reporters. Indeed, the triumphant Mr. Dulles also wanted to replicate the "Hungarian Campaign." This time, as we all know, his plan failed. The dramatic events in Guatemala only shook all the republics of the Americas, but if Dulles had succeeded in Hungary, it would have undermined socialist construction in many places and posed a sharp threat to world peace.

In China, I was spending a few days of sea bathing and sunbathing on a Pacific beach; when I read in the newspaper that Castillo Armas, the traitor cultivated by the US State Department in Guatemala, had been assassinated, everything mentioned above came to my mind.

I think, thanks to the excellent American journalism, we will soon see some fascinating memoirs of Mr. Dulles, revealing how and why he discarded this pitiful Castillo Armas, who was merely a puppet on a string, after crowning him president. It is not easy to suppress freedom in a small country like Guatemala, which has already known and tasted freedom; recently, students, workers, and peasants have not concealed their dissatisfaction. Everyone knows that the days of American imperialism in Latin America are numbered. To be realistic, I would calculate in days, weeks, months, or years, but certainly not in centuries. If there is any place in the world where all patriots are united against the trade and political oppression of the US government, it is Latin America. A huge wave of demanding liberation, revolt, and independence is sweeping through all brotherly countries.

Not long ago, Anastasio Somoza, the ruler of Nicaragua, a notorious figure, was also assassinated. For thirty years, he turned his country into a most vile and abject tyranny. The United States armed the Nicaraguan army, making it a well-equipped force whose sole function was to protect the interests of that banana monopoly organization. This time, a young Nicaraguan patriotic fighter shot and assassinated the tyrant; doctors specially sent by Eisenhower by plane from Washington could not save Somoza's life.

The Colombian dictator, the fierce and sinister Rojas Pinilla, has been expelled from the country by his people and had to flee to Franco's Spain. Various forces, including the bourgeoisie and the people, including the Catholic Church, participated in this struggle. Some time ago, Rojas had just signed an agreement granting a Wall Street company new concessions and privileges. When he was overthrown, American entrepreneurs were still holding a celebration in New York for the Colombian tyrant.

Cuba is the stage for a long and painful drama. The dictator Batista, in order to hand over the island's resources to American sugar trusts, did not hesitate to impoverish and enslave his own country. Countless officials and workers were killed. In some parts of Cuba, armed struggle continues, and this struggle will surely become increasingly profound.

Many anti-imperialists in Latin America often resort to individual acts of terror, which are exploited by the oppressed and often provoked by the oppressors. But this is not a general rule. In my homeland, Chile, and in other countries across the vast American continent, organized masses are increasingly understanding the meaning of a comprehensive liberation struggle. Socialists and communists study the investment of American capitalism in our countries, and many ordinary people also understand the economic and political problems hidden behind these staggering transactions.

When Guatemala fell into the hands of the US State Department and its agents, students in my homeland gathered in the streets and burned the American flag. Undoubtedly, this was an excessive act. This flag was not only raised in the evil deeds of imperialists, it also represents the country of Whitman, Lincoln, and many people we cannot confuse with the Dulles brothers. However, the burning of this flag expresses the anger of millions of people in Latin America who have lost their illusions.

Because we once hoped that this flag could represent the best ideals of a young and vigorous nation. We once hoped that this flag would not become a symbol of destroyers and oppressors.

In any case, we will continue to hope that the United States can change. We South Americans will continue to hope in this way, but without abandoning our own people or ceasing our struggle.

    中美洲的枪声
    智利诗人  巴勃罗·聂鲁达
    在1949年，担任危地马拉总统的，是一位民主人士，就是胡安·何塞·阿雷瓦洛博士。他在自己的办公室里接见了我。这是一个身材高大、豪爽、可亲的人。从总统府的窗口，可以看见首都明亮的屋顶。室内一切都很整齐；这是一个有条不紊、一丝不苟的人的办公室。
    但是使我诧异的，就是在离阿雷瓦洛博士头顶上几公分的墙上，竟有一些小洞。总统大厅这样整齐，但是对墙壁上这块地方却疏忽而未加修理，看来是很奇怪的。我的目光不由自主地紧盯住这块美中不足的地方。
    “那是美国枪弹打的，”阿雷瓦洛博士发觉了我的好奇，向我说明。“我故意把它保存原状，作为对我自己的一个永远的警告。”阿雷瓦洛总统镇压了三十多次暴动；制造暴动的，就是美国联合果品公司，这是一个在中美洲所有各国既做生意又搞政治阴谋活动的美国垄断组织。
    不久之后，新来的一阵美国弹雨，毁灭了许多人的性命，并且打垮了这个小小的民主国家。
    一份美国杂志上，不久以前发表了一个职业记者所写的一批耸人听闻的文章，这些文章以艾伦·杜勒斯所口述的回忆录的形式出现，这个人就是美国那位臭名昭著的国务卿的弟弟，他像他哥哥一样在美国政府里占据着一个高级职位。艾伦·杜勒斯是全世界美国间谍工作的头子。
    这些文章里透露出杜勒斯如何计划并执行了“危地马拉之役”。杜勒斯先生收买了危地马拉一个小军官，供给他武器和金钱，把他扶植起来担任危地马拉的独裁者。从巴拿马的美国基地起飞的飞机，在血泊和火海中窒息了要求独立的感情。杜勒斯先生得到了暂时的胜利而得意洋洋了。这种得意心情，在他对记者谈话中溢于言表。的确，得意洋洋的杜勒斯先生，又想依法泡制“匈牙利之役”。这一次呢，正如我们大家都知道的，他的计划失败了。危地马拉的戏剧性事件只是震动了美洲所有各共和国，但是杜勒斯如果在匈牙利得胜，就会破坏了许多地方的社会主义建设，并对世界和平造成一个尖锐的威胁。
    在中国，我正在太平洋一处海滩上过着几天海水浴和日光浴的日子；当我从报上看到美国国务院在危地马拉扶植起来的卖国贼卡斯蒂略·阿马斯已经被暗杀，我的脑海里就想起了上面所说的一切。
    我觉得，由于美国新闻事业办得这样出色，我们不久一定就会看到杜勒斯先生的某些引人入胜的回忆录，透露出他是如何并且因为什么缘故要把这个沐猴而冠地称为总统的可怜的卡斯蒂略·阿马斯摔开。危地马拉这样小的一个国家，本来已经知道了什么是自由，尝过了自由的滋味，现在要把自由镇压下去，可不是一件容易的事情，最近学生、工人、农民都不隐瞒自己的不满了。人人都知道，美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的日子是屈指可数的了。为了现实一些，我要以多少天、多少星期、多少个月或多少年来计算，但决不是以多少世纪来计算。如果世界上有那一个地方所有的爱国者都一致反对美国政府的贸易压迫和政治压迫的话，那么这就是拉丁美洲。一个要求解放、要求起义、要求独立的巨大浪潮，正在一一卷遍所有兄弟国家。
      不久以前，尼加拉瓜的统治者、著名的安纳斯塔肖·索摩查，也被暗杀了。三十年来，他把自己国家变成了一个最恶劣最卑污的暴政之国。美国武装了尼加拉瓜军队，使它成为一支装备优良的力量，其唯一职能就是保护那个香蕉垄断组织的利益。这一次是一个尼加拉瓜青年爱国志士开枪行刺这个暴君，艾森豪威尔特别用飞机从华盛顿派来的医生，并不能挽救索摩查一命。
    哥伦比亚的独裁者、凶狠险恶的罗哈斯·皮尼利亚，已被国内人民驱逐出境，不得不逃亡到佛朗哥的西班牙。参加这个斗争的，有资产阶级和人民的各种不同的力量，包括天主教会在内。前些时候罗哈斯刚刚签订过一个协定，给予华尔街一家公司以新的让步和特惠。当他被推翻的时候，美国企业家们还正在纽约为这个哥伦比亚暴君开庆祝会呢。
    古巴是一幕长期痛苦的戏剧的舞台。独裁者巴蒂斯塔为了把这个岛国的富源拱手让给美国的糖业康采恩，不惜使本国贫穷和遭受奴役。无数职员和工人被杀害了。在古巴的某些地方，武装斗争还在继续进行，这个斗争一定会越来越深入。
    拉丁美洲的许多反帝国主义者往往采取个人恐怖行动，这些行动被压迫者所利用，而且往往是压迫者所挑起的。但这并不是一个通例。在我的祖国智利，还有在广阔的美洲大陆的其他国家，有组织的群众日益理解到全面的解放斗争的意义。社会党人和共产党人研究美国资本主义在我们各国投资的情况，许多普通的人民也了解到这些数目惊人的交易后面藏着的经济与政治问题。
    当危地马拉落到美国国务院及其代理人手中的时候，我的祖国的学生在大街上集合，烧掉了美国国旗。无疑，这是一种过分的行动。这面国旗不仅是在帝国主义者的罪恶行动中升起来的，它也代表着惠特曼、林肯以及许多我们不能与杜勒斯兄弟混为一谈的人们的国家。但是，这面国旗的被焚烧，正是表达了拉丁美洲千百万人民的愤怒，他们已丢掉了幻想。
    因为我们曾经希望这面国旗能代表一个年青力壮的民族的最优秀的理想。我们曾经希望这面国旗不致变成为破坏者和压迫者的旗号。
    不管怎样，我们将继续希望美国能有所转变。我们南美洲人将继续这样希望，但既不背弃我们自己的人民，也不停止我们的斗争。
