　　Supporting the Arab People's Anti-Imperialist Struggle
　　Indian People Gather

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 26th. The All-India Peace Council held a public gathering here on the evening of August 25th, at which a resolution was unanimously passed supporting Oman and Syria and condemning imperialist aggression in the Middle East.

　　In the resolution on the issue of freedom for the people of Arab countries, the conference expressed warm support for the struggles of the Arab people for freedom, independence, and the safeguarding of national sovereignty. The resolution strongly condemned the British and French governments for their brutal suppression of the Omani and Algerian people's struggles for freedom. The resolution demanded that the British and French governments immediately withdraw their troops from Oman and Algeria.

　　The resolution stated: "The main reason for the current tense situation in West Asia is the interference by imperialist countries in the internal affairs of Arab countries through the Baghdad Pact Organization and other similar military arrangements. The obvious attempt of the Eisenhower Doctrine is to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries."

　　In its resolution, the conference assured the government and people of Syria of "full support for their efforts to safeguard independence and sovereignty and to oppose the conspiracies and military threats aimed at imposing the Eisenhower Doctrine on Syria."

　　Singh, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, delivered a speech at the meeting. He called for the continuation of the peace movement and the curbing of imperialist conspiracies in the Middle East.

　　支持阿拉伯人民反帝斗争
　　印度人民集会
    据新华社新德里26日电　全印和平理事会8月25日晚间在这里举行了一次公众集会，会上一致通过了支持阿曼和叙利亚、谴责帝国主义侵略中东的决议。
    大会在关于阿拉伯各国人民的自由问题的决议中热烈支持阿拉伯各国人民为自由、独立和维护国家主权所进行的斗争。决议强烈谴责英国和法国政府残酷镇压阿曼和阿尔及利亚人民争取自由的斗争。决议要求英国和法国政府立即从阿曼和阿尔及利亚撤退它们的军队。
    决议说：“目前西亚紧张局势的主要原因是帝国主义国家通过巴格达条约组织和其他类似的军事安排干涉阿拉伯国家的内政。艾森豪威尔主义的明显企图就是干涉这些国家的内政。”
    大会在它的决议中向叙利亚政府和人民保证“完全支持他们为维护独立和主权、反对借以把艾森豪威尔主义强加给叙利亚的阴谋和军事威胁而作的努力”。
    全印和平理事会副主席辛格在会上发表了演说。他号召把和平运动继续下去，并且制止帝国主义在中东的阴谋。
