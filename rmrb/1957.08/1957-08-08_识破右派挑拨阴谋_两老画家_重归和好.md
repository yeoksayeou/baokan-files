Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th. Having recognized the conspiracy of rightist elements to undermine unity, two well-known Shanghai traditional Chinese painters, He Tianjian and Wu Hufan, who had long been at odds, eliminated misunderstandings and shook hands in reconciliation at a symposium held by the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Artists Association on August 3 to criticize rightist ideology.

These two landscape painters, both over sixty years old, had some unpleasantness before liberation regarding the issue of teaching students, and did not interact much with each other. In the early days after liberation, they both expressed their intention to unite and reconcile, dedicating their efforts to the cause of traditional Chinese painting. Last year, when the preparatory committee for the Shanghai Chinese Painting Academy was established, they were both invited to serve as preparatory committee members. However, not long after, due to the instigation of rightist elements from the China Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, their relationship deteriorated again, to the point where they ignored each other when they met, and even argued.

Not long after the preparation for the Chinese Painting Academy began, rumors suddenly spread in Shanghai's Chinese painting circles that Wu Hufan was going to become the president of the academy. Soon after, the China Democratic League said it would support He Tianjian as president of the academy, and even sent people to visit He Tianjian, saying that Wu Hufan was not as good as him. Rightist elements Chen Renbing (China Democratic League) and Wu Miaonian (Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party) and others also arranged for a group of Chinese painters whom they had exploited to infiltrate the quarterly painting evaluation committee held by the Chinese Artists Association last year, deliberately causing the works of He Tianjian and Wu Hufan to be rejected, devaluing the works of painters from the Chinese Painting Academy, and inciting disunity between painters inside and outside the academy. The two of them, caught in the traps set by the rightist elements, became increasingly suspicious of each other, and their prejudices deepened. Due to the sabotage by rightist elements inside and outside the academy, the Chinese Painting Academy, which had been in preparation for a year, has not yet been established.

After the launch of the anti-rightist struggle, the conspiracy of rightist elements to undermine Shanghai's Chinese painting cause was exposed. The doubts of these two painters disappeared. At the meeting on the 3rd, they both expressed their intention to reconcile.

    识破右派挑拨阴谋
    两老画家
    重归和好
    新华社上海6日电　长期不睦的上海两位著名国画家贺天健和吴湖帆，识破右派分子破坏团结的阴谋，在8月3日的美协上海分会批判右派思想座谈会上，消除误会，握手言欢。
    这两位年过六旬的山水画家，解放前在教授学生的问题上，曾经有过一些不愉快的事情，彼此不大交往。解放初期，两人曾经表示要团结和好，为国画事业献力。去年上海成立国画院筹备委员会时，他俩都被聘请为筹备委员。可是不久，由于民盟和农工民主党右派分子从中挑拨，两人关系又形恶化，见面互不理睬，甚至争吵。
    国画院筹备不久，上海国画界忽然谣传吴湖帆要当国画院院长。不久，民盟又说要支持贺天健当国画院院长，还特地派人访问贺天健，并说吴湖帆不如他。右派分子陈仁炳（民盟）、吴淼年（农工民主党）等又布置了一批被他们利用的国画家，打入去年美协举办的国画季度评奖委员会，故意使贺天健和吴湖帆的作品落选，贬低国画院画家的作品，挑拨画院内外画家的团结。他们两人在右派分子设下的圈套里互相猜忌，成见愈来愈深。由于右派分子在画院内外破坏，使筹备了一年的国画院至今未能成立。
    反右派斗争开展后，右派分子破坏上海国画事业的阴谋被揭穿了。这两位画家的疑团顿消。在3日那次会上，他俩表示要重归于好。
