　　Establish a Mechanical Industry System According to Specific Conditions
　　Fan Fusheng
    "The Cook on a Desert Island" is Outdated
    There are two types of industrial construction systems: one is based on technical specialties and interacts and combines, and the other is based on enterprises as units and is self-contained.
    A self-contained industry is like a cook on a desert island, who needs to handle everything from making vinegar, drying sauce, brewing wine... to cooking. Factories built according to this system are equipped with everything from power, gas, heating, tool manufacturing, all mechanical processing, and small mechanical manufacturing departments specifically for supplying their own various non-standard equipment. This construction system is suitable for regions or countries with poor industrial conditions or remote areas where it is difficult to obtain external cooperation.
    The interactive and combined industrial system is completely different. Each factory only masters the production of the most critical parts for product performance and the final assembly, while other parts are supplied by external factories; at the same time, it also undertakes orders with its own professional technology, forming groups of production networks based on professional technology. Therefore, the quality is high, the cost is low, and the development is fast. Industrialized or concentrated countries mostly use this system. The relationship between small factories in Shanghai in the past was similar to this.
    The factories built in our country in the early period of the First Five-Year Plan were mostly of the self-contained type to a certain extent. Because the industrial foundation of old China was too poor, it was necessary to be independent and self-sufficient at the beginning of construction. However, in the development of these years, the situation has changed. If adjustments are not made immediately, this situation will become a serious obstacle to the construction cause.
    "Specialization" Shackles Hands and Feet
    After 1952, the main machinery manufacturing industry in our country began to specialize according to some models of Soviet products. That is to say: a certain factory only manufactures certain models of machines, or only produces a certain type of equipment.
    In order to determine the professional production direction of factories and enable them to strive to improve production technology with clear goals, specialization is correct. However, it was not considered that this kind of industry with only division of labor but no combination, few varieties, and small output, would be difficult to adjust when it cannot meet the complex needs of the vigorous development of the national economy. Later, there was a remedial method, that is, to hand over some local state-owned factories or joint state-private factories to certain requesters, and let them cultivate and solve the problems themselves. This is a quick-fix method with more disadvantages than advantages, but it only solves the urgent needs of some key industries, and still cannot take care of the broad needs at the grassroots level.
    This simple division of labor that does not play a role in combination also makes it impossible for many units to buy things even with money. As a result, people have the illusion that the supply of machinery and equipment is in short supply because there are too few manufacturers.
    Two small examples can be used to illustrate this.
    In the past, a machine tool factory in Chongqing produced a simple tool grinder, which was very suitable for use in some large-scale production workshops. After specialization in 1955, the Chongqing factory no longer produced this thing. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory specializes in the production of grinders, but does not produce this product without standard models. Moreover, the tool grinders produced by the Shanghai factory are very difficult to order, and it is impossible to get drawings for self-made ones. As a result, it can only be replaced by buying foreign equipment.
    For example, a factory specializing in the production of punch presses is limited by its technical strength and equipment strength because it must manufacture all parts by itself. The variety of specifications cannot be developed rapidly. Slightly larger punch presses must be purchased from abroad, which not only wastes foreign exchange, but also delays the time to put them into production.
    Properly Arrange Two Brother Industries
    Outside of the machinery manufacturing industry, the defense industry uses the most machinery. Its relationship with the machinery manufacturing industry is the closest, and it can help the machinery manufacturing industry to greatly increase its production capacity. But if it is arranged improperly, it can also offset the production power of the machinery industry.
    Countries around the world have several different types of arrangements for these two major industries. The first is to disperse the defense industry into the general machinery manufacturing industry, and the defense industry department only grasps the reference gauges, technical regulations, and planning work. Ordinary machinery manufacturing factories may all participate in the production of the defense industry. According to different needs, it can also be used entirely for civilian production or entirely for defense production. Countries with generally higher industrial levels or with larger foreign markets mostly belong to this type. The second is that the government only controls a very small number of defense factories as the basis for trial production and research work, and then plans to cooperate with the ordinary machinery industry around it as a reserve force to participate in production at any time. In the past, some European countries mostly implemented this combination when the requirements for national defense forces were more urgent and the national economic strength was limited to a certain extent. The third is that the defense industry is established as a separate system, completely isolated from the civilian machinery industry, and does not interact with each other. Old China took this path.
    The defense industry of old China was gradually built up during the late Qing Dynasty and the period of warlord separatism. At that time, there was almost no machinery industry of its own, so it had to be independent. The Kuomintang government did not build anything during its era and maintained the status quo. This situation had already shown its inappropriateness in the late period of old China: the factories equipped according to professional products could not be used for a large part of the time, and the output was not enough during the war; in peacetime, better machinery and equipment and more skilled technicians were idle, and they could not be replenished when needed.
    Every country needs to have a proper defense industry to defend itself. Especially when the American imperialists are still occupying Taiwan and eyeing China covetously, we cannot be negligent. During the First Five-Year Plan, the construction steps of our defense industry were correct. However, during the Second Five-Year Plan, the country's industry will have a greater degree of development. If we do not make favorable arrangements for these two major industries in advance that are suitable for the country's situation, there will inevitably be some left-leaning or right-leaning deviations. Being too left-leaning will increase the burden on the national economy and delay the speed of construction; being too right-leaning will easily be satisfied with the existing defense forces and relax further strengthening.
    Due to the superiority of the planned economy, if it is necessary to continue to strengthen the defense industry, we are fully qualified to make this strengthening not only not increase the burden on the national economy, but also become a powerful tool to promote the construction cause and improve the people's material living standards under the combined industrial system we have formulated.
    The question is what kind of industrial combination system is really suitable for our country.
        To Suit National Conditions
    Our country's situation is: the area is vast, the types of industries and mines are numerous, the people's material living requirements are extensive, the design system is complex, so the specific requirements for machinery and equipment are huge and complicated. And the small machinery industry in old China was not only too small, but also concentrated in a few coastal cities. Compared with the vast needs, the large factories newly built and rebuilt during the First Five-Year Plan also seem very few, and the types of products are limited. Therefore, it is far from meeting this huge and complicated need.
    The layout of industry, like social and political practice, also needs to adopt a layout that suits the actual situation of our country; it cannot force the vast needs to conform to or obey the methods that have been successful in other countries.
    Here is a small example of using machines to illustrate. In the past, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory produced a Q51-type tool grinder, which was generally welcomed by the factories that used it. Because in addition to the main function of a tool grinder, it can also be used as a small surface grinder and internal and external cylindrical grinder. Some factories also use it as a special machine tool for sample mechanization. It is said that the machinery industry department once planned to eliminate and reduce production because it was not an international standard model. Although it was not eliminated in the end because there were too many orders, restricting production caused a lot of inconvenience to users, and many factories had to spend a lot of money to purchase various small precision grinders from abroad.
    This was not a big deal, but it fully shows that Chinese industry has its own unique needs in practice. The reason why the Q51-type tool grinder is so popular is because most of our factories do not yet have the ability to equip too many different types of specialized grinders (even if they have the money to buy them, the utilization rate is too low). Therefore, we must never stop producing and developing it just because many industrialized countries do not produce this kind of all-purpose equipment. In our country's special circumstances, we should both absorb the successful experiences of advanced industrial countries, and develop and create products that meet our unique needs.
          Two Suggestions
    The above situation shows that in the machinery manufacturing industry, a collective combination suitable for our country's situation is needed. This combination should be able to leverage all dispersed forces to meet the needs of national economic development; to enable various industries to grow and develop more conveniently; to make production technology more specialized and rapidly improved on a professional basis; and to enable the country to achieve the best results with the most economical investment.
      How can this be achieved? Here are two suggestions as a reference for the overall layout.
    1. The entire country's machinery manufacturing department, regardless of its work tasks or product nature, should conduct interactive combinations on the basis of technical specialties to form a multilateral production network. Each factory only masters the manufacturing of the most critical parts of its products, that is, the manufacturing and final assembly of the parts that are most closely related to product performance. Other general parts are supplied by other professionally skilled factories, and the factory itself produces a large number of various forms of components with its own professional characteristics to supply others.
    Because each factory is a technical specialty, the quality of the product is high and the cost is low. Technical strength and special equipment can be used intensively.
    This production network should be based on regions. Within a region, regardless of which department's machinery manufacturing part, such as metallurgy, defense, textile, transportation, locomotive, shipbuilding, automobile... etc., are all members of this combination under the unified leadership of the state. From the design of the factory to the arrangement of annual production tasks, everything takes the combined production network as a whole.
    2. Under the leadership of the State Planning Commission and the Technical Commission, establish a National Industrial Design Institute as the highest unified industrial design and research institution in the country.
    Now the state only focuses on grasping several economic indicators, relaxes the review and control of the technical measures to complete these economic indicators, and even more relaxes the research and investigation of the design effects. Therefore, it is necessary to establish such a unified institution.

　　根据具体情况建立机械工业体系
　　范复生
    “荒岛上的厨师”过时了
    工业建设的体系有两种，一种是以技术专业为基础而交互组合的，一种是以企业为单位单独自成一套的。
    单独成套的工业就如同在荒岛上的厨师一样，需要从制醋、晒酱、酿酒……一直到烹调。按这种体系建设的工厂，从动力、煤气、水暖、工具制造、全部的机械加工，以及专为供应本身各种非标准设备用的小机械制造部门，样样具备。这种建设体系适宜使用于工业条件很差或者地区荒僻、不易取得外界配合的地区或国家。
    交互组合的工业体系则完全不同。每一个工厂只掌握对产品性能最关键部分的生产与最后的装配，其他的部件则由外厂供应；同时也以自己的专业技术承制订货，相互间形成一组组的以专业技术为基础的生产网。所以质量高、成本低、发展快。工业发达或集中的国家多取用这种体系。从前上海小工厂之间的关系也与此近似。
    我国在第一个五年计划初期建设的工厂，在一定程度上大都属于单独成套的类型。因为旧中国的工业基础太差，所以建设开始，一切非独立自给不可。但在这几年的发展中，情况已经改变，如果不立即进行调整，这种状况将会成为建设事业中的严重障碍。
    “专业化”缚住了手脚
    1952年以后，我国主要的机械制造业开始以苏联产品的一部分型号为标准进行专业分工。就是说：某一个工厂只制造某几种型号的机器，或只生产某一类的设备。
    为了确定工厂的专业生产方向，使各厂在明确的目标下努力提高生产技术，专业分工是正确的。但是没有考虑到这种只有分工而无组合的、品种少、产量少的工业，在不能满足国民经济蓬勃发展的繁杂需要时，就很难进行调整。后来曾经有一种补救方法，就是将一些地方国营工厂或公私合营工厂交给某些需要者，由他们自行培养自行解决。这是弊多利少的急救方法，但还仅只解决一部分重点工业的急需，对于基层的广泛需要，仍旧不能照顾。
    这种不起组合作用的单纯分工，也使得很多单位有时拿钱都买不到东西。以致造成人们的错觉，好像机器设备供不应求，是制造厂太少了。
    可以举两个小事例来说明。
    从前重庆一个机床厂生产一种简单的工具磨床，非常适合某些大规模生产车间应用，1955年专业分工后，重庆厂不再生产这种东西了。上海机床厂专业生产磨床，但不生产这种没有标准型号的产品。而且上海厂生产的工具磨床很不容易订购，要图纸自制也要不到。结果只有买国外设备代替。
    又如专门生产冲床的工厂，因为必须自己制造全部部件，所以技术力量、设备力量都受限制，品种规格不能迅速发展，稍微大一点的冲床，必须向国外购买，不仅浪费外汇，而且投入生产的时间也得延迟。
    恰当安排两个兄弟工业
    在机械制造工业以外使用机械最多的是国防工业。它同机械制造业的关系最密切，它能帮助机械制造业极大限度的增长生产能量。但如果安排得不恰当，它也能抵消机械工业的生产力量。
    世界各国对这两大工业有几种不同类型的安排。第一种是将国防工业分散渗透到一般机械制造工业当中去，国防工业部门只掌握基准量具、技术法规同筹划工作。普通的机械制造工厂都可能有一部分参加国防工业的生产。根据需要不同，也可以全部作民用生产，或全部作国防生产。在工业水平普遍比较高或是有较大国外市场的国家，多属于这种类型。第二种是政府只掌握极少数的国防工厂，作为试制及研究工作的基础，另外则环绕在它的周围，有计划地配合普通机械工业，作为随时参加生产的后备力量。以前某些欧洲国家，对国防力量要求比较急切而国家经济力量又有一定限制时，多实行这种组合。第三种是国防工业单独成立一个体系，同民用机械工业完全隔离，互不往来，旧中国就是走的这条路。
    旧中国的国防工业是在清朝末年同军阀割据时期逐渐兴建起来的，当时几乎没有自己的机械工业，所以不得不独立自成一家。国民党政府时代没有建设，仍旧保持原状。这种状况在旧中国末期已经显示出它的不适合性：根据专业产品所配备的工厂，在平时很大一部分不能派用途，在战时产量又不够用；在平时，比较好的机器设备同较熟练的技术工人都闲置起来，等到需要时又补充不上。
    每一个国家都需要有一个恰当的国防工业来保卫自己。尤其当美帝国主义者还侵占着台湾向中国虎视眈眈时，我们更不能稍有疏忽。第一个五年计划期间，我们国防工业的建设步骤是正确的。但是在第二个五年计划内，国家的工业将要有更大程度的发展，如果不对这两大工业在事先作出适合国家情况的有利安排，必定会发生一些过左或过右的偏差。过左则增加了国民经济的负担，延迟了建设的速度；过右则容易满足于已有国防力量，放松了更进一步的加强。
    由于计划经济的优越性，如果需要对国防工业继续加强，我们完全有条件在我们自己拟定的组合工业体系下，使这种加强不仅不增加国民经济的负担，而且还能成为推进建设事业同提高人民物质生活水平的有力工具。
    问题在于怎样才是真正适合于我们国家的工业组合体系。
        要适合国情
    我国的情况是：地区辽阔，工矿的种类繁多，人民物质生活的要求广泛，设计体系复杂，所以对机械设备的具体要求庞大杂乱。而旧中国的小机械工业不仅太少，而且集中在几个沿海城市。第一个五年计划中新建和改建的大工厂同广大的需要比较起来也显得很少，产品种类又有限。因此，远不能满足这种庞杂的需要。
    工业的布置同社会政治实践一样，也需要采取适合于我们国家实际情况的布置；而不能强使广大的需要去符合或者去服从那些在别的国家已经取得成功的方法。
    这里列举一个使用机器的小事例就可以说明。从前上海机床厂出产一种虬51型的工具磨床，普遍受到使用工厂的欢迎。因为它除了作为工具磨床的主要功能以外，还能当作小型的平磨床和内外圆磨床用。也有些工厂用来作样板机械化的专用机床。据说机械工业部门曾经因为它不是国际上的标准型号，一度准备淘汰而减产。最后虽然因为要求订货的太多而没有被淘汰，但因为限制生产，曾经给使用者造成很多不便，很多工厂不得不花重资去购买国外的各种小型精密磨床。
    这本来是一件不大的事，但充分说明中国工业在实用上有自己独特的需要。虬51型工具磨床之所以广受欢迎，是因为在我们大多数工厂里还没有能力配备太多的各种不同种类专一性的磨床（即令有钱购买而使用率也太低）。所以我们决不能因为很多工业发达的国家都不生产这种万能性质的设备，便也不生产它和发展它。在我国的特殊情况下，应当既吸收先进工业国的成功经验，也发展和创造适合我们独特需要的产品。
          两点建议
    以上情况说明，在机械制造工业中，需要一种适合我们国家情况的集体性的组合。这种组合要能够发挥所有分散的力量来满足国民经济发展的需要；要能够使各种工业较便利地成长和发展；使生产技术在专业基础上更专更迅速地提高；使国家以最经济的投资取得最良好的效果。
      怎样能够做到这样呢？这里提出两点意见作为整体布置的参考。
    一、整个国家的机械制造部门，无论工作任务怎样，产品性质怎样，都应当在技术专业的基础上，进行交互组合，形成多边关系的生产网。每一个工厂只掌握它产品中最关键性零件的制造，也就是与产品性能有最密切关系的零件的制造与最后的总装配。其他一般的零件则由其他专业技术的工厂供给，而工厂本身则又大量生产各种形式具有自己专业特长的部件供应别人。
    因为每一个工厂都是技术专业，所以产品的质量高、成本低。技术力量同专用设备都能集中使用。
    这种生产网应以地区为单位。在一个区域内，无论那一部门的机械制造部分，如冶金、国防、纺织、交通、机车、船舶、汽车……等，都在国家统一领导下作为这个组合中的一员。从工厂的设计开始到每年生产任务的布置，一切都以组合生产网为整体。
    二、在国家计划委员会同技术委员会的领导下，建立国家工业设计院，作为全国最高的统一的工业设计及研究机构。
    现在国家只偏重掌握经济上的几种指标，放松了审核与掌握完成这些经济指标的技术措施，更放松了对设计效果进行研究调查。因此，有必要设立这样一个统一的机构。
