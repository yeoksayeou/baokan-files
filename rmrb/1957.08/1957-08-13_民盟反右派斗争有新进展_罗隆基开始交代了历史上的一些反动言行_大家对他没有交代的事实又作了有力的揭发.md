The anti-Rightist struggle within the China Democratic League (CDL) has made new progress. Luo Longji has begun to confess some of his historical reactionary words and deeds. Everyone has vigorously exposed facts he has not confessed.

(Our Dispatch) At the seventh enlarged plenary session of the CDL Central Committee's rectification movement held on the afternoon of the 12th, Luo Longji's deceptive cloak of having "performed meritorious service in opposing Chiang" was thoroughly and completely stripped away. Luo Longji also began to confess his consistent pro-Chiang, pro-American, and anti-communist reactionary behavior. At the beginning of the meeting, CDL Vice Chairman Ma Xulun, who attended despite being ill, severely denounced Luo Longji for creating a chaotic "middle road" during the Liberation War under the planning of American imperialism, attempting to ultimately save the reactionary rule of the US-Chiang clique, and demanded that Luo Longji thoroughly confess. Hu Yuzhi, Secretary-General of the CDL Central Committee, then pointed out that based on the materials revealed at the last meeting, Luo Longji not only did not sever ties with the Kuomintang during the Liberation War, but also continued to collude with Kuomintang secret agents, Li Zongren, and Lei Zhen. Therefore, he demanded that Luo Longji thoroughly confess his pro-Chiang anti-communist reactionary activities. Due to everyone's insistence on reasoned struggle and the exposure of a large number of facts, Luo Longji began today to confess some of his pro-American, pro-Chiang, and anti-communist and politically double-dealing behavior before and during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. Luo Longji admitted that he had written articles in the *New Moon* magazine offering advice to Chiang Kai-shek, arguing that it was not enough to suppress the communists with military force alone, but also to suppress them ideologically. Luo Longji also wrote editorials in the *Yi Shi Bao* advocating "internal stability before resistance to foreign aggression," urging Chiang Kai-shek to resist Japan first and then eliminate the communists. During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, he admitted that he had been colluding with American imperialists such as Marshall and Stuart, disagreeing with the CDL standing on the side of the Communist Party, always wanting to become an official in the Kuomintang government. He did not believe the Liberation War would be victorious, believing that the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was irreconcilable, and that the CDL could play a pivotal role between the two sides, thereby realizing his pro-American line. He once offered advice to Marshall, believing that the CCP would not be victorious and advocating that China implement Anglo-American politics, hoping to gain American support. His pro-American anti-communist line was highly praised by Marshall. However, he still confessed very little about the Zhang-Luo alliance and his recent anti-communist, anti-socialist reactionary clique's conspiracy activities in the past few years.

Next, speakers revealed a large number of facts about Luo Longji's consistent pro-American and anti-communist activities. The Third Plenary Session of the CDL Central Committee held in Hong Kong in 1948 was a historically significant meeting for the CDL to end its middle road and cooperate closely with the Communist Party. Luo Longji confessed today that he agreed to convene the Third Plenary Session, but only opposed its one-sided political line. Is this really the case? In past meetings, many people had already exposed Luo Longji's many sabotage activities against the resolution of the Third Plenary Session. Today, Gao Tian revealed that Luo Longji not only sabotaged the implementation of the resolution after the meeting, but also sent people to obstruct the meeting and opposed the CDL headquarters in Hong Kong. Gao Tian said that when the Third Plenary Session was held, Luo Longji hurriedly sent Zhou Jingwen, Liu Wangliming, and Luo Hanxian, members of his reactionary clique, to Hong Kong to investigate and obstruct the meeting. They opposed progressive forces, attempting to influence the meeting's criticism of the middle road and its determination of a new line of cooperation with the CCP. Luo Longji, on the other hand, hijacked Chairman Zhang Lan in Shanghai to create a CDL Central Committee centered on himself, opposing the CDL headquarters in Hong Kong, which adhered to the correct political line. After the CDL was forced to disband at the end of 1947, Luo Longji once wanted to write a petition to Chiang Kai-shek requesting the restoration of the CDL's legal status. In 1948, after the CCP Central Committee issued the May 1st Slogan, Luo Longji personally drafted a letter hijacking Zhang Lan to the CDL headquarters in Hong Kong, emphasizing that the CDL should be "absolutely independent." Isn't it very clear which side Luo Longji wanted to lean towards?

Chiang Kai-shek's tearing up of the Old Political Consultative Conference resolutions and convening of the pseudo-National Assembly marked Chiang Kai-shek's final alienation from the people. What was Luo Longji's attitude towards the Kuomintang at that time? In his confession, he portrayed himself as refusing to participate in the pseudo-National Assembly, but according to Chen Xingui's exposure, Luo Longji had once secretly discussed this matter with Xin Zhichao behind closed doors. Luo Longji very much wanted to become an official in the Kuomintang government, was determined to participate in the pseudo-National Assembly, and was actively preparing a list of CDL representatives to participate in the pseudo-National Assembly. Fortunately, Chairman Zhang Lan and the majority of CDL comrades firmly opposed it, and Luo Longji did not drag the CDL down.

Chen Xingui also revealed: After hearing the news of Li Zongren's election, Luo Longji was immediately overjoyed and excited, saying that Li was honest and kind, so he was able to win people's hearts. At that time, Zhang Qun, the pseudo-Executive Yuan President, once said that Luo Longji was a national talent and should be cherished. Zhang Qun had also sent checks to Luo Longji. During Luo Longji's stay in the Hongqiao Sanatorium, Chen Xingui had seen a letter written by Lei Zhen to Luo in Luo's house, saying: "Since my brother is interested in politics, I hope he takes good care of himself." Feng Sutao also revealed Luo Longji's reactionary behavior in actively trying to participate in the pseudo-National Assembly. In November 1946, the third round of peace talks was held in Nanjing, and Luo Longji was one of the CDL's representatives to the peace talks. In order to become an official in Chiang Kai-shek's government, Luo Longji did not hesitate to betray the CDL and the CCP's Old Political Consultative Conference alliance, threatening the Communist Party to submit to Chiang Kai-shek so that he could participate in the pseudo-National Assembly as scheduled. When Feng Sutao accused him of betraying the Communist Party, Luo Longji said with emotion: "You are really a bookworm. Politics is the most realistic thing. Can we still wait for the Communist Party to succeed? You are only in your forties this year, and you can wait a few more years. I am already over fifty!"

At today's meeting, Pu Xixiu revealed some important materials about Luo Longji's reactionary activities. During the second working conference of the CDL, Pu Xixiu personally heard Luo Longji and Sun Dayu say that he had read Sun Dayu's 80,000-word opinion letter attacking the Party and slandering Communist Party members as counter-revolutionaries, and advised him that it was not appropriate to publish it at that time. Pu Xixiu also revealed that Ye Duyi was a liaison officer of the Zhang-Luo alliance who ran around to the Zhang-Luo camp. Then Lu Guangguang and Xu Guangping both cited some of Ye Duyi's reactionary behavior, demanding that everyone not let go of this cunning rightist.

Wang Ailan, who had worked as Luo Longji's family nurse, and Zhang Dengzhi, Luo Longji's guard, angrily denounced Luo Longji's bullying behavior towards the working people who served him and his utterly rotten private life at today's meeting. Luo Longji once falsely accused Wang Ailan of stealing his money without any evidence, shamelessly threatening and even interrogating Wang. Luo Longji often threatened to arrest and imprison the workers who sewed clothes for him and the peasants who delivered water to him. When the concubine of the big traitor Zhou Fohai went to Luo Longji's house, he told Wang Ailan that this was his best friend's lover. Luo Longji immediately quibbled about this on the spot, saying that he heard the guard say that Wang Ailan had peeked at his internal documents. Zhang Dengzhi immediately stood up to expose his lies, and enumerated many facts about Luo Longji's habitual lying, urging everyone to be vigilant against this lying king. The audience responded with warm applause to Wang and Zhang's exposure.

Many others had registered to expose Luo Longji's pro-American, pro-Chiang, and anti-communist reactionary behavior, but due to time constraints, they did not speak. Xin Zhichao and Huang Yaomian also spoke at today's meeting. Finally, Hu Yuzhi announced that Luo Longji must continue to confess his anti-communist and anti-socialist activities after liberation, especially in the past two or three years, at the next meeting. Rightists Ye Duyi and Zeng Zhaolun should also confess, and it will not work to try to get away with it.

    民盟反右派斗争有新进展
    罗隆基开始交代了历史上的一些反动言行
    大家对他没有交代的事实又作了有力的揭发
    本报讯　12日下午举行的民盟中央第七次整风扩大座谈会，彻底干净地剥下了罗隆基“反蒋有功”的迷惑人的外衣，罗隆基也开始交代他一贯亲蒋亲美反共的反动行为。会议一开始，带病出席的民盟副主席马叙伦就痛斥罗隆基在解放战争期间，在美帝国主义策划下，搞
  “中间路线”搞得乌烟瘴气，企图最后挽救美蒋的反动统治，要求罗隆基彻底交代。民盟中央秘书长胡愈之接着指出就上次会议上所揭发的材料看，在解放战争期间，罗隆基同国民党的关系不但没有切断，而且同国民党特务、同李宗仁、雷震一直勾勾搭搭。因此，要求罗隆基彻底交代他亲蒋反共的反动活动。由于大家坚持说理斗争，揭发大量事实，罗隆基今天开始交代了一些他在抗日战争前后以及解放战争期间亲美亲蒋反共以及政治上的两面派行为。罗隆基承认他曾经在新月杂志上写文章，为蒋介石献策，不能只用武力剿共，还要思想剿共。罗隆基还在益世报上写社论主张“攘外而后安内”，要蒋介石先抗日再灭共。在抗日战争解放战争期间，他承认他一直和马歇尔、司徒雷登等美帝国主义分子勾结，不同意民盟和中共站在一边，一直想做国民党的官，他不相信解放战争会胜利，认为国共之间不可调和，民盟则左右两方举足轻重，借此实现他的亲美路线。他曾向马歇尔献策，认为中共不会胜利，主张中国实行英美政治，希望得到美国支持。他的这种亲美反共路线很得到马歇尔的称赞。但是，对于章罗联盟、对于他最近几年的反共反社会主义反动小集团的阴谋活动，仍然很少交代。
    接着发言的人又揭发了罗隆基一贯亲美反共的大量事实。1948年，民盟中央在香港举行的三中全会，是民盟结束中间路线和共产党亲密合作的一次有历史意义的会议。罗隆基今天交代说，他赞成召开三中全会，只是反对三中全会一边倒的政治路线。事实是不是这样呢？在过去的几次会议上，许多人已经揭露了罗隆基反对三中全会决议的许多破坏活动。今天，高天又揭露了罗隆基不但在会后破坏决议的实现，还派人阻挠会议的进行，并反对香港的民盟总部。高天说，在三中全会举行的时候，罗隆基就赶派他的反动小集团中的周鲸文、刘王立明、罗涵先到香港摸底并阻挠会议的进行。他们和进步力量对立，企图使会议批判中间路线、确定和中共合作的新路线受到影响。而罗隆基则在上海挟持张澜主席另搞一个以自己为中心的民盟中央与坚持正确政治路线的香港民盟总部对立。1947年底民盟被迫解散后，罗隆基曾经要写呈文给蒋介石要求恢复民盟的合法地位，而1948年当中共中央发出五一号召后，罗隆基却亲自起草挟持张澜给香港民盟总部写信，强调民盟要“绝对独立”，罗隆基究竟要倒向哪一边不是很明显的吗？
    蒋介石撕毁旧政协决议召开伪国大，标志着蒋介石已经最后自绝于人民，当时罗隆基对国民党是什么态度呢，他的交代中把自己说成是拒绝参加伪国大的，但据陈新桂揭发，当时，罗隆基曾经和辛志超关起门来密谈过此事。罗隆基很想当国民党的官，已决心参加伪国大，还积极准备民盟参加伪国大的代表名单。幸亏张澜主席和民盟大多数同志坚决反对，罗隆基才没有把民盟拖下水去。
    陈新桂还揭发：罗隆基听到李宗仁当选的捷报后，登时眉飞色舞兴奋之至，还说李为人忠厚，所以能得人心。当时伪行政院长张群曾经表示，罗隆基是国家人材，应当爱护，张群还曾给罗隆基送支票，罗隆基住在虹桥疗养院期间，陈新桂还曾在罗的房子中看到雷震亲笔写给罗的信上说：“吾兄既对政治有兴趣，希多珍摄。”冯素陶也揭露罗隆基积极设法参加伪国大的反动行为。1946年11月，在南京举行第三次和谈，罗隆基是民盟参加和谈的代表之一。为了要做蒋介石的官，罗隆基不惜背弃民盟和中共的旧政协联盟，要胁共产党向蒋介石屈服，以便他能够如期参加伪国大。当冯素陶责备他不该背叛共产党的时候，罗隆基不胜感慨地对他说：“你真是一个书呆子，搞政治是最现实不过的，我们还能等到共产党成功吗？你今年还不过四十多岁，还可以多熬几年，我已经过了五十岁了！”
    今天的会上，浦熙修揭发了罗隆基进行反动活动的一些重要材料。在民盟第二次工作会议期间，浦熙修亲耳听到罗隆基和孙大雨说，他看过了孙大雨向党进攻的诬蔑共产党员为反革命分子的八万言的意见书，还劝他说当时发表不合适。浦熙修还揭露，叶笃义是奔走于章罗门前的章罗联盟的联络员。接着吕光光，许广平都举出了叶笃义的一些反动行为，要求大家不要放过这个狡猾的右派分子。
    曾经做过罗隆基家庭护士的王爱兰和罗隆基的警卫员张登智，在今天的会上愤怒地控诉罗隆基对为他服务的劳动人民的恶霸行为，和他的腐烂透顶的私生活。罗隆基曾经毫无证据的诬陷王爱兰偷了他的钱，无耻地对王进行威胁以至审问。罗隆基对给他缝衣的工人、给他送水的农民……动辄就以押起来、关起来相威胁。当大汉奸周佛海的小老婆去罗隆基家时，他告诉王爱兰说，这是他的最好的朋友的爱人。罗隆基对此还当场狡赖，说他听的警卫员说，王爱兰曾经偷看过他的内部文件。张登智立即站出来揭穿他的谎言，并且历数罗隆基信口撒谎的许多事实，要大家警惕罗隆基这个撒谎大王。会场上对王、张的揭发报以热烈的掌声。
    在会上报名要求揭露罗隆基亲美亲蒋反共反动行为的还有许多人，因为时间关系，没有发言。在今天会上发言的还有辛志超、黄药眠。最后，胡愈之宣布，罗隆基在下次必须继续交代他在解放以后，特别是最近两三年来的反共反社会主义活动。右派分子叶笃义和曾昭抡也都应该交代，想混过关是不行的。
