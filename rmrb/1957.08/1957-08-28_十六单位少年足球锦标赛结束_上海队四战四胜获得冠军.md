　Sixteen Unit Youth Football Tournament Concludes
　　Shanghai Team Wins Championship with Four Straight Victories
    Xinhua News Agency, August 27th. The second stage of the 1957 Sixteen Unit Youth Football Tournament concluded on the 26th. The competition committee announced today the final standings of each team: The Shanghai Youth Football Team won the championship of this tournament with a record of four wins in four games. In their matches against the other four teams, their total score for goals scored versus goals conceded was eleven to one.
    Of the six youth football teams that originally participated in the second stage, the Shenyang team's results were not included in the standings because one of its players was over the age limit stipulated in the competition rules.
    In this competition, the Tianjin Youth Football Team unexpectedly lost to the Yanbian team, which had finished third in the first stage's regional competition, with a score of zero to three. Although the Tianjin team later drew with the Shanghai team with a score of zero to zero and defeated the Guangzhou team and the Changsha team with scores of three to two and six to zero respectively, they ultimately finished as runner-up due to losing one game.
    The Yanbian team and the Guangzhou team both won two games and lost two games in the competition, but the Yanbian team had one more net goal than the Guangzhou team, so they won third place. The Guangzhou team ranked fourth, and the fifth place went to the Changsha team, which lost all four games.

　  十六单位少年足球锦标赛结束
　　上海队四战四胜获得冠军
    新华社27日讯　1957年十六单位少年足球锦标赛第二阶段比赛，已经在26日全部结束。竞赛处今天公布了各队比赛的名次：上海少年足球队以四战四胜的成绩，获得了这次锦标赛的冠军。他们在同其他四个队的比赛中，得球和失球的总比数是十一比一。
    原先参加第二阶段比赛的六个少年足球队中，由于沈阳队的一个运动员年龄已超过竞赛规程规定标准，这个队的比赛成绩未列入名次。
    天津市少年足球队在这次比赛中，出人意料地以零比三败给了在第一阶段分区比赛中获得第三名的延边队。后来天津队虽然同上海队以零比零踢成和局，并以三比二和六比零分别战胜了广州队和长沙队，但他们终因输了一场而退居亚军。
    延边队和广州队在比赛中都是胜两场、败两场，但是延边队比广州队净胜的球数多了一个，因而获得第三名。广州队名列第四，第五名是四战四负的长沙队。
