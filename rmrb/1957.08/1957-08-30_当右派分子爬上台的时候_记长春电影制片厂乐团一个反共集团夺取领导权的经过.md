　　When Rightists Climbed the Stage
    ——An Account of a Counter-Revolutionary Group Seizing Leadership in the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra

    On a small square table in the center of the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra's anti-Rightist struggle meeting venue, sat the core members of the so-called "Presidium" who had seized the party and government leadership of the orchestra: Liu Zhengtan, Fang Zhenxiang (Communist Party Branch Committee Member), Zeng Yajie (Communist Youth League Member), Yang Gongquan (Communist Party Member), Lü Xiaoqiu (Communist Youth League Member), Guo Desheng, and others. Not long ago, these rightists, in their capacity as the "Presidium," had arrogantly incited the masses to engage in anti-Communist activities. Now, they had to bow their heads and listen to the angry exposures and criticisms of the surrounding masses, and repeatedly stand up to express their guilt.

    The head of the "Presidium," Liu Zhengtan, rushed back to Changchun Film Studio from the Tianjin Central Conservatory of Music when the rectification campaign began. He joined forces with Fang Zhenxiang, Yang Gongquan, and others who had long been dissatisfied with the Party. After several secret meetings, they concluded that they must elect their own "representatives" to take control of the rectification leadership.

    What followed was the sabotage of performance plans. The Changchun Film Studio Orchestra originally planned to go on a three-month tour in mid-June. The rightists, fearing that they would lose the opportunity to oppose the Communist Party, convened an emergency meeting to discuss how to ruin the performance. They spread rumors, saying: "Someone is selling us out, and we are still going out to perform!" They also spread the word that: "Our program will be laughed at by others!" As a result, this tour was sabotaged.

    They also separately incited and co-opted people who had made mistakes, been criticized, and were previously targets of the anti-espionage campaign, provoking and fueling their dissatisfaction with the leadership. On the eve of the orchestra's general meeting, they held another secret meeting, fabricating a so-called "conspiracy" by a certain Party leader.

    The next day (May 30), according to their predetermined plan, they widely spread the rumor of the so-called "conspiracy" event among the masses in the morning, causing the atmosphere in the orchestra to become tense. When the orchestra held a "voicing opinions" meeting in the afternoon, Zeng Yajie first raised the so-called "conspiracy" event and openly cursed. At this time, the emotions of the deceived and incited masses were aroused, and Liu Zhengtan took the opportunity to propose the demand to remove the existing leadership and elect representatives of the masses. In this way, the so-called "Presidium" which excluded all the original leaders was quickly elected.

    On the first day of the "Presidium's" tenure, it established propaganda groups, special case groups, and even attempted to establish a "anti-espionage issues group." Under the leadership of this "Presidium," the "voicing opinions" meeting became a place where a few people fabricated accusations against the leaders and cursed the Party and government leaders of the orchestra. The "Presidium" completely broke away from the leadership of the Party organization. This "Presidium" was like the "autonomous cabinet," as Luo Dou, a reporter from "Wenyi Bao" and a rightist, who visited Changchun Film Studio at the time, said. The "Presidium" proudly received this "reporter," introduced him to the situation of the "Presidium" in power, and had this "reporter" write a report. The "Presidium" also sent Liu Zhengtan as a "ambassador to Beijing" to Beijing to carry out unspeakable activities.

    This so-called "Presidium" ran rampant in the Changchun Film Studio Orchestra for eighteen days, attempting to remove all the leaders of the orchestra and replace them with themselves.

    Now, the staff of Changchun Film Studio are continuing to pursue and demand that these rightists honestly confess their crimes to the people.

　　当右派分子爬上台的时候
    ——记长春电影制片厂乐团一个反共集团夺取领导权的经过
    新华社记者　李德天
    在长春电影制片厂乐团反右派斗争大会会场正中的一张小方桌上，围坐着曾经夺取了乐团党政领导权的所谓“主席团”的骨干分子：刘正谭、方振翔（中共支部委员）、曾亚杰（共青团员）、杨公权（共产党员）、吕小秋（共青团员）、郭德胜等人。这些右派分子在不久前，还十分嚣张地以“主席团”身分煽动群众进行反共活动，如今却不得不低着头倾听周围群众愤激的揭露和批判，并且一再起立表示请罪。
      “主席团”的头子刘正谭，整风开始时，他由天津中央音乐学院匆匆赶回长春电影制片厂，和长期对党不满的方振翔、杨公权等人结合起来，几次秘密集会，他们得出的结论是必须选出自己的“代表”来掌握整风领导权。
    他们紧接着的是破坏演出计划。长影乐团原计划在6月中旬赴外地作三个月的巡回演出，右派分子唯恐因此失去反对共产党的机会，就召集紧急会议，研究搞垮演出。他们造谣说：“有人在出卖我们，我们还出外演出！”一面又散布说：“我们的节目拿出去要笑掉别人的大牙！”结果这次巡回演出就被破坏了。
    他们还分头煽动、拉拢曾经犯过错误、受过批评和曾是肃反对象的人，挑拨、助长这些人对领导的不满。在乐团举行大会的前夕，他们又召开了一个秘密会议，捏造了党的某一领导人的所谓“阴谋”。
    第二天（5月30日），他们按照预定计划，在上午就把所谓“阴谋”事件的谣言在群众中广泛散布，乐团空气因而紧张起来。下午乐团举行“鸣放”大会时，曾亚杰首先提出所谓“阴谋”事件，并且公然谩骂。这时，被欺骗、煽动的群众情绪激昂，刘正谭就乘机提出不要现有领导和选群众代表的要求。就在这样情况下，很快地选出了排斥掉原来所有领导人的所谓“主席团”。
    “主席团”上任的第一天，成立了宣传组、专案组等等，还企图成立“肃反问题小组”。在这个“主席团”主持下的“鸣放”会形成了少数人给领导捏造罪状、谩骂乐团党政领导人的场合。“主席团”完全脱离了党组织的领导。这个“主席团”就如同当时来长影访问的“文艺报”记者、右派分子罗斗所说的一样，像是“自治内阁”。“主席团”曾经得意洋洋地专门接待了这个“记者”，向他介绍了“主席团”执政的情况，并且由这个“记者”写了报道。“主席团”还曾经派刘正谭作为“驻京大使”去北京进行不可告人的活动。
    这个所谓“主席团”曾经在长影乐团横行了十八天，他们企图把乐团领导人全部搞下台，由他们取而代之。
    现在，长影职工正继续追击，要这些右派分子老实地向人民交代他们的罪行。
