According to the Heilongjiang Daily: More than ten geological surveying teams dispatched by the Heilongjiang Provincial Geological Department are advancing towards the underground resources of the Greater and Lesser Xing'an Mountains, and have found many valuable mineral deposits for the country.

The rich underground resources of the Greater and Lesser Xing'an Mountains have never been explored by anyone and have always been known as a geological blank area. Now, a large Greater Xing'an Mountains regional geological surveying team, under the leadership of experienced Soviet experts, is trekking through the inaccessible mountains and fields. A detachment of this surveying team discovered copper mineralization points in Badaoguan, with a wide distribution area. Another detachment also discovered comprehensive mineral belts of platinum, tin, iron, and copper in the Jiakada area. The Lesser Xing'an Mountains regional geological surveying team near Heihe also discovered gold and several super-genetic rock iron deposits, providing extremely valuable clues for finding minerals such as nickel, chromium, platinum, and asbestos, which are urgently needed for national construction.

Working alongside the surveying team are several geological prospecting teams. After well exploration and drilling, the Shiwudui prospecting team discovered that the distribution of copper ore is very wide, and there are also mineralization phenomena in the deep strata. The Suqin prospecting team has delineated a lead ore belt as long as one kilometer, and preliminary identification shows that the grade of ore in some places can reach the mining standard.

　　兴安岭发现丰富矿藏
    本报讯　据黑龙江日报报道：黑龙江省地质部门派出的十几个地质勘测队，正在向大小兴安岭的地下资源进军，已为国家找到了许多珍贵的矿藏。
    大小兴安岭的丰富地下资源，从来没有人去探索过，一向被称为地质空白区。现在，一支庞大的大兴安岭区域地质测量队，在富有经验的苏联专家领导下，跋涉在人迹罕至的山野里。这个测量队的一个分队，在八道关发现了铜的矿化点，分布的面积很广。另一个分队在加卡达一带，也发现了白金、锡、铁、铜等综合性的矿带。在黑河附近的小兴安岭区域地质测量队，也发现了金和若干超级性岩铁，对于寻找国家建设急需的镍、铬、铂和石棉等矿产，提供极其可贵的线索。
    与测量队并肩工作的，还有数个地质普查队。十五堆普查队经过井探和钻探，发现铜矿分布的很广，地层深部也有矿化现象。苏沁普查队已圈定了一个长达一公里的铅矿矿带，初步鉴定有些地方的矿石品位可以达到开采标准。
