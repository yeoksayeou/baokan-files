    Yunnan Publishing circles have produced a protector of poisonous weeds – the rightist Pang Wenhui.

    Pang Wenhui is an editor at the Yunnan People's Publishing House. In June, he wrote a ten-thousand-word letter, advocating the widespread release of poisonous weeds. He said, "Poisonous weeds have their inherent vitality." He said arrogantly, "Attempting to eradicate all poisonous weeds with one hand only invites ridicule for being overwhelmed and fully demonstrates one's own weakness." He wants the leadership of the publishing house to allow both fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds to coexist in the publication of popular books and political education and policy propaganda books. Even knowing it's a poisonous weed, it should still be published. Therefore, he advocates that "speaking out freely" should not have political standards. He believes that "those with deep-seated class hatred should speak out freely." He slandered Marxist-Leninist works and Party political documents as "clichés and platitudes" and wants to fight for the publication of non-Marxist-Leninist books. He opposes the Party's policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in literature and art, saying that this policy "does not respect the Chinese literary tradition." He attempted to usurp the leadership of the Yunnan People's Publishing House, advocating the establishment of an "Editorial and Review Office," with him as the deputy director of the Editorial and Review Office.

    During the "speaking out freely" period, he also attacked the Party's leadership as being "fond of creating chaos" and "wielding power as soon as they have it," saying that the Party "oppresses people with its power."

    Since July, the Yunnan People's Publishing House has held several debate meetings in succession to sternly refute Pang Wenhui's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. After all his fallacies were completely bankrupt, Pang Wenhui resorted to being unreasonable and refusing to come to work, threatening to "take a long vacation" in an attempt to evade the struggle. The staff of the publishing house is continuing to pursue the attack.

### 云南出版社右派分子庞文会主张  明知是毒草也要出版

    云南出版社右派分子庞文会主张
    明知是毒草也要出版
    本报讯　云南出版界出现了毒草的保护人——右派分子庞文会。
    庞文会是云南人民出版社的编辑，6月间他曾写了一份万言书，主张要大放毒草。他说“毒草有他内在的生命力”。他狂妄地说：“企图一手铲除一切毒草的做法，徒增捉襟见肘之讥，充分显明自己的懦弱罢了”。他要出版社的领导在通俗书籍和政治教育、政策宣传书籍的出版工作中，香花与毒草并存。明知毒草，也要出版。因此他主张鸣放不应有政治标准，他认为“有刻骨阶级仇恨的要大放”。他诬蔑马列主义著作和党的政治文件是“陈词滥调”，要为出版非马列主义的书籍而斗争。他反对党的为工农兵服务的文艺方针，说这个方针是“不尊重中国的文艺传统”。他企图篡夺云南人民出版社的领导权，他主张成立“编审室”，由他来任编审室的副主任。
    在鸣放中，他还攻击党的领导是“好乱成性”，是“一朝权在手，便把令来行”，说党是“用势压人”。
    7月份以来，云南人民出版社连续举行了多次辩论会，对庞文会的反党反社会主义言行进行了严正的驳斥。庞文会在他的谬论全部破产之后，竟耍赖不上班工作，扬言要“请长假”。企图以此来逃避斗争，出版社的工作人员正在继续追击。　　　　　（新华社专稿）
