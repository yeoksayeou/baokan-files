Doctor Guo Jingxian, attending physician of the Dongchuan People's Committee clinic in Yunnan and a rightist, tried his best to sow discord between the Party and intellectuals. However, he was only acting in vain. His fallacies have now completely gone bankrupt. Let everyone take a look at this malicious poem he wrote:

　　Since entering the city, big and small gauze hats are worn indiscriminately,
　　Some are called lords and kings, some are state officials and government officials.
　　The master sits in the hall to handle affairs, assistants stand on both sides,
　　Kneeling intellectuals, old technical personnel.
　　Those with bad backgrounds, those who often complain,
　　Those with complicated histories, those who often oppose the leadership,
　　Those with purely technical viewpoints, in short, are not good people.
　　Beat me on the buttocks, beat, beat,
　　Some were beaten eight hundred times, some were beaten three thousand times.
　　This is the help of the higher authorities, first admit the mistake, then kowtow to thank them for their grace, from then on, ideological awareness is raised...

His slander doesn't stop there, he shamelessly said: "The relationship between the Party and intellectuals is not even as good as the colonies under the rule of French imperialism - Annam."

The matter is now as clear as fire, it turns out that Guo Jingxian has never lost the true colors of a lackey of French imperialism.

Guo Jingxian received a slave education from French imperialism from an early age. He studied at the Kunming Sino-French School and Shanghai Aurora University for a total of thirteen years, "worshipping Western material civilization and Parisian life wholeheartedly." After graduating from Aurora University in 1941, he had been engaging in activities such as performing abortions for others to make illegal income. After liberation, the People's Government sanctioned his corrupt behavior on the one hand, and still arranged work for him on the other. The people of Dongchuan even elected him as a people's representative. But he did not repent, and not only neglected human life in his medical work, but also launched such a vicious attack on the Party's policy toward intellectuals during the rectification campaign. From this it can be seen that this shameless man has truly reached the point of madness.

　　医生郭景贤患了反共病
　　章皆淳
    云南东川人民委员会门诊部主治医生、右派分子郭景贤，极力挑拨党和知识分子的关系。但是，他只是徒劳。他的谬论现在已经完全破产了。大家看看他写的这篇恶意的诗吧：
    自从入城以来，大小纱帽乱戴，　有的称侯称王，有的州官府官。
    老爷坐堂理事，助手站立两边，　下跪知识分子，旧的技术人员。
    那些出身不好，那些常发牢骚，　那些历史复杂，那些常反领导，
    那些有纯技术观点，总之，不是好人。　与我在屁股上打，打，打，
    有的打了八百，有的打了三千。
    这是上级帮助，首先承认错误，然后叩谢恩典，从此觉悟提高，……
    他的诬蔑还不仅此，他竟然无耻地说：“党跟知识分子的关系还不如法帝国主义统治下的殖民地——安南。”
    事情到此就明若观火，原来郭景贤始终不失法帝国主义者的奴才本色。
    郭景贤自小就接受法帝国主义的奴化教育。他在昆明中法学校和上海震旦大学共读了十三年书，“对西方物质文明及巴黎生活崇拜得五体投地”。1941年他由震旦大学毕业后，一直干着替人打胎等勾当，牟取非法收入。解放后，人民政府一方面制裁了他的贪污行为，另一方面仍安排他的工作。东川人民还选了他当人民代表。但他竟不痛改前非，不仅在医务工作上玩忽人命，更在整风开始期间向党的知识分子政策作了这种恶毒的进攻。由此可见，这个无耻之徒，真正到了丧心病狂的程度了。
