Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric Dispatch: Liaoning Province has overcome a severe drought and basically completed its sowing plan for major autumn crops. Currently, crops are growing well in most areas.

This year, most areas of Liaoning Province generally experienced drought conditions. In the coastal areas where the drought was relatively severe, including Dalian, Xinjin, Andong, Gaiping and other twelve counties (cities), all or part of the region had not had a thorough rain for fifty to seventy consecutive days. The drought was not completely relieved until late July. Only about half of the counties in the province experienced lighter drought conditions.

After the drought occurred, the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee immediately established a drought relief headquarters and sent many responsible cadres to various places to guide the drought relief effort. More than two million people in agricultural cooperatives in drought-stricken areas throughout the province were mobilized daily for drought relief sowing. In severely drought-stricken areas, more than 90% of the members of agricultural cooperatives were engaged in the drought relief effort.

According to statistics from thirty-eight counties, drought-resistant sowing was carried out on 416,000 hectares of farmland. According to statistics from another thirty-nine counties, 300,000 hectares of farmland that had been destroyed by the drought were replanted. As a result, the province basically completed its sowing plan for autumn fields.

Currently, the rural areas of Liaoning Province have entered the post-planting management season. Agricultural cooperatives in various places are actively preventing and controlling various natural disasters, and are striving for a bumper harvest this year on the basis of the victory over the drought.

    辽宁省战胜干旱
    大秋作物生长良好
    据新华社沈阳电　辽宁省战胜了严重干旱，基本上完成大秋作物的播种计划。目前，多数地区作物生长良好。
    今年辽宁省大部地区普遍呈现旱象。干旱比较严重的沿海地区旅大、新金、安东、盖平等十二个县（市）的全部或部分地区，一直连续五十到七十天未降透雨，旱象直到7月下旬才全部解除。全省只有约占半数的县份旱象较轻。
    旱象发生后，辽宁省人民委员会立即成立了抗旱指挥部，派出许多负责干部到各地指导抗旱斗争。全省受旱地区农业社每天出动了二百多万人进行抗旱播种。干旱严重的地区，农业社90％以上社员都投入了抗旱斗争。
    据最近三十八个县的统计，抗旱播种的农田即有四十一万六千公顷。另据三十九个县的统计，抗旱补种毁种的农田达三十万公顷。使全省秋田基本上完成了播种计划。
    目前，辽宁省农村已进入挂锄季节，各地农业社正在积极防治各种自然灾害，在抗旱胜利的基础上努力争取今年大丰收。
