Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 13th: The industrial and commercial circles of Wuhan are further overcoming lenient tendencies, exposing the new tricks of rightists in resisting the struggle, in order to carry out the anti-rightist struggle to the final victory.

    At the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle in Wuhan's industrial and commercial circles, the leadership group of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce was controlled by rightists such as Wang Yiming and Li Wujiu. Not only did they not actively lead the anti-rightist struggle, but they also shielded and echoed the rightist leader Zhang Naiqi, hindering the development of the struggle. At this time, many industrialists and businessmen were afraid of tearing apart relationships and of retaliation, and dared not boldly expose and participate in the struggle. At that time, in order to smoothly carry out the anti-rightist struggle, at the request of the majority of industrialists and businessmen, the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association reorganized the leading group of the anti-rightist struggle, and held various meetings and adopted methods of individual contact and mobilization at all levels, to carry out propaganda and education on the anti-rightist struggle for the majority of industrialists and businessmen, and to criticize lenient tendencies and right-leaning ideas. In particular, after exposing a large number of anti-Communist and anti-socialist facts of rightists such as Wang Yiming and Li Wujiu, the majority of industrial and commercial circles were further educated, many people brightened their eyes, right-leaning ideas and lenient tendencies were somewhat overcome, and a new group of rightists were further exposed, the tricks of rightists such as hard resistance, soft procrastination, and denial were exposed, and the arrogance of many rightists who openly resisted the struggle was defeated, achieving an initial victory in the struggle.
    However, recently, rightists have come up with new tricks to resist the struggle. Many rightists do not confess any important issues, but on the surface pretend to be honest, making lengthy "self-criticisms" and even weeping bitterly to arouse the sympathy of others. On the other hand, they viciously attack certain leaders and activists in the current anti-rightist struggle in the industrial and commercial circles, dragging them down by using the historical stains of certain people, attempting to undermine the leading core and create ideological confusion in the industrial and commercial circles, so as to achieve the purpose of evading the struggle. Some people with wavering wills, under this new conspiracy of the rightists, have seen lenient tendencies and right-leaning ideas show signs of rising again. Some of them say: "People like Zhang Naiqi and Wang Yiming have a market for their remarks and can be criticized a bit, but there is really nothing to criticize about some small rightists in the district federations of industry and commerce." Others advocate that instead of adopting the method of reasoning struggle against the rightists, it is "best to influence the rightists with examples of the contrast between the old and the new."
    Currently, the relevant leaders in Wuhan are continuing to deeply mobilize the masses, exposing the new tricks of the rightists; strengthening propaganda and education work, helping the majority of industrialists and businessmen recognize the conspiracies and tricks of the rightists, and improving the ideological understanding of the industrialists and businessmen, so that the anti-rightist struggle in the industrial and commercial circles can achieve a complete victory.

### 不要被右派分子的新花招迷惑  武汉工商界应坚持斗争

    不要被右派分子的新花招迷惑
    武汉工商界应坚持斗争
    据新华社武汉13日电　武汉市工商界正在进一步克服温情主义，揭发右派分子抗拒斗争的新花招，以便把反右派斗争进行到最后胜利。
    武汉市工商界反右派斗争一开始，市工商联的领导集团被王一鸣、厉无咎等右派分子所掌握，他们不但不积极领导反右派斗争，而且为右派头目章乃器打掩护和帮腔，阻挠斗争的开展。这时，不少工商业者怕撕破面皮、怕打击报复，不敢大胆揭发和参加斗争。当时为了顺利开展反右派斗争，武汉市工商联、民建市委员会在广大工商业者的要求下，改组了反右派斗争的领导集团，并召开各种会议和采取个别串联、层层发动的方法，对广大工商业者进行反右派斗争的宣传教育，批判温情主义和右倾思想。特别是揭发了右派分子王一鸣、厉无咎等的大量反共、反社会主义的事实以后，广大工商界进一步受到教育，不少人擦亮了眼睛，右倾思想和温情主义有所克服，从而进一步揭发了一批新的右派分子，揭穿了右派分子硬抗、软拖、抵赖等诡计，打下了许多右派分子公开抗拒斗争的嚣张气焰，取得了斗争的初步胜利。
    但是，最近以来，右派分子又想出了新的花招来对斗争进行抗拒，很多右派分子不交代任何重要问题，但表面上假装老实，作长篇大论的“检讨”以至痛哭流涕引起别人的同情，另一方面恶毒的攻击现在工商界反右派斗争的某些领导者和积极分子，借某些人历史上的污点，拖他们下水，企图以此破坏领导核心，在工商界中造成思想混乱，达到逃避斗争的目的。有一部分意志不坚定的人，在右派分子这个新的阴谋下，温情主义和右倾思想又有重新抬头的趋势，他们有的说：“像章乃器、王一鸣这些人，言论有市场，可以反一下，对区工商联的一些小右派，真没有什么可反的。”还有人主张对右派分子不要采取说理斗争的办法，而是要“最好以新旧对比的事例来感化右派分子。”
    目前武汉市有关领导方面正在继续深入发动群众，揭穿右派分子的新花招；加强宣传教育工作，帮助广大工商业者认识右派分子的阴谋诡计，提高工商业者的思想认识，以便使工商界的反右派斗争获得彻底胜利。
