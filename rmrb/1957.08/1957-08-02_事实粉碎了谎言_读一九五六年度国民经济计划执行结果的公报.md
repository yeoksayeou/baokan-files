Facts Shatter Lies
    --Reading the Communiqué on the Implementation Results of the 1956 National Economic Plan

The State Statistical Bureau has issued a communiqué on the implementation results of the 1956 national economic plan. Just as the anti-Rightist struggle is turning deeper and expanding to all parts of the country, this communiqué from the State Statistical Bureau provides us with a powerful weapon to counter the Rightists' slanders against the socialist system and their attempts to obliterate the achievements of socialist construction. With conclusive figures, it comprehensively narrates the great achievements our people, under the leadership of the Party and the government, made in socialist transformation, in the development of industry, agriculture, transportation, postal and telecommunications services, education, culture, health, and basic construction, as well as in improving the lives of workers and staff in 1956. Anyone who observes the issue with a pragmatic attitude will easily recognize through this communiqué whether our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction are "terrible" or very good.

The development of industrial production in 1956 enabled our industrial output value to grow one year ahead of schedule and over fulfill the 1957 target set by the First Five-Year Plan by 9.5%. Among them, electricity production reached 16.59 billion kilowatt-hours, raw coal production reached 105.922 million tons, pig iron production reached 4.777 million tons, steel production reached 3.921 million tons, and cotton cloth production (excluding handicrafts) reached 4.6 billion meters. These may all be very dry numbers; however, anyone who knows something about the history of China's industrial development, as long as they do not speak against their conscience, cannot but admit that these are astonishing numbers. Compared with the industrial level of old China, there is simply a world of difference. 1941 was the year with the highest electricity production in our country before liberation, but the power generation that year was only 5.96 billion kilowatt-hours; the electricity production in 1956 increased by 179% compared with 1941. 1942 was the year with the highest coal production in our country before liberation, but the raw coal production that year was only over 60 million tons; the raw coal production in 1956 increased by 71.2% compared with 1942. 1943 was the year with the highest iron and steel production in our country, but the pig iron production that year was only about 1.8 million tons; the steel production was only about 680,000 tons; the pig iron production in 1956 increased by 165.2% compared with 1943, and the steel production in 1956 increased by 471.5% compared with 1943. 1936 was the year with the highest cotton cloth production in our country, but the cotton cloth production that year was only 1.65 billion meters; the cotton cloth production in 1956 increased by 178.9% compared with 1936. It is particularly worth pointing out that when the mainland of China was liberated in 1949, the level of industrial production had plummeted compared to the highest annual output before liberation. For example, the pig iron production was only 246,000 tons, and the coal production was only over 30 million tons. We rose up to catch up on such a meager industrial base, and in just a few years, we have left the level of the highest annual output before liberation far behind. In the face of these conclusive materials, who can deny that our construction achievements are the main thing!

The Rightists slander that agricultural collectivization was "messed up." What is the fact? The fact is that although last year was the year when agricultural collectivization was just basically completed, the newly born agricultural production cooperatives had already demonstrated vigorous vitality in overcoming natural disasters and striving for agricultural harvests. As everyone knows, the natural disasters in agriculture in 1956 were multifaceted and serious. Many areas suffered from floods, typhoons, and droughts, with disaster-stricken areas exceeding 200 million mu. The affected population was about 50 million people. Many crops, especially grains and cotton, suffered considerable losses. However, due to the basic realization of agricultural collectivization nationwide in 1956, the construction of farmland water conservancy, and the promotion of various advanced production experiences and production measures, the output of most major crops still increased compared to 1955. Taking the total grain output as an example, it still increased by 4.4% compared with the bumper harvest of 1955, reaching the 1957 target set by the First Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. It is impossible to imagine how a "terrible" countryside could show such great strength in agricultural production?

Some people say: "Those whose living standards have improved are Party members and cadres who used to wear torn shoes but now ride in small cars and wear woolen uniforms." What is the fact? The fact is that last year the average wage of workers and staff nationwide increased by 14% compared with the previous year, the number of workers and staff enjoying labor insurance increased by 30% compared with the previous year, and the number of workers and staff enjoying free medical care increased by 11% compared with the previous year. In other words, last year the total wage bill of workers and staff increased by about 2.7 billion yuan compared with the previous year, the number of workers and staff enjoying labor insurance reached 7.4 million, and the number of workers and staff enjoying free medical care reached 6.6 million. In addition, the state invested in the construction of new employee housing totaling 25 million square meters. Don't these figures illustrate that the lives of the vast majority of workers and staff are guaranteed and that living standards have improved? Is it true that "the lives of workers have improved, and the lives of peasants have suffered"? It can also be seen from the communiqué that the income of farmers has also increased. Last year, in areas that were not affected by disasters or were only slightly affected, about 80% of agricultural production cooperatives increased production, and about 75% of farmers increased their income. Although disaster areas reduced production or had very little harvest, through agricultural production cooperatives organizing production for self-relief, coupled with government assistance, the lives of members were generally guaranteed. Last year's commercial retail sales increased by 19% compared with 1955, which also shows the huge growth in people's purchasing power.

We are not prepared to list all the figures in the communiqué to refute reactionary fallacies one by one. Any upright person can see from the results of the implementation of the 1956 national economic plan whether the Communist Party and the state led by the Communist Party have achieved any results? How great are the achievements? May I ask which government in history can do so many things and achieve such great results in a year?

Of course, the Communist Party and the state led by the Communist Party never shy away from the shortcomings and mistakes in their work. The communiqué of the State Statistical Bureau has already summarized the shortcomings and errors in the formulation and implementation of the 1956 national economic plan. Because our subjective understanding is not completely consistent with objective reality, some deviations inevitably occurred in the formulation and implementation of the plan, such as the investment plan for basic construction being too large, the increase in workers and staff being too large, and so on. Although these shortcomings and errors in work have brought some difficulties and adverse effects to the work arrangements in 1957; compared with the enormous achievements, these shortcomings and errors are, after all, secondary. The Rightists attempt to seize on some shortcomings and errors in the work of the Communist Party and the People's Government, incite a part of the people to make trouble, and "overthrow" the Communist Party and the People's Government. Their illusion is now completely bankrupt.

We oppose obliterating achievements, but we never revel in the face of achievements; we oppose exaggerating shortcomings and errors, but we never shy away from shortcomings and errors, and we resolutely correct all shortcomings and errors in our work. Our socialist cause will continue to advance on the basis of consolidating achievements and correcting mistakes. In the first half of this year, on the basis of the victory in 1956, China's working class has made outstanding contributions to the completion of the national plan, and the total industrial output value has increased by 10.8% compared with the same period last year. We call on the people of the whole country to continue their efforts, deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy, overcome all difficulties, and strive to comprehensively complete and over fulfill the 1957 national economic plan, use practical actions to counter the Rightists' challenge to socialism, and continue to advance our socialist cause!

### 事实粉碎了谎言——读一九五六年度国民经济计划执行结果的公报

    事实粉碎了谎言
    ——读一九五六年度国民经济计划执行结果的公报
    国家统计局发表了关于1956年度国民经济计划执行结果的公报。正当反右派斗争转向深入、并向全国各地扩展的时候，国家统计局的这份公报，给了我们一个反击右派分子污蔑社会主义制度和抹煞社会主义建设成就的有力的武器。它用确凿的数字，全面叙述了1956年我国人民在党和政府的领导下，在社会主义改造、在发展工业、农业、运输业、邮电事业、教育文化卫生事业和基本建设以及在改善职工生活等方面所取得的伟大成绩。每一个以实事求是的态度来观察问题的人，都不难通过这份公报认清我们国家的社会主义改造和社会主义建设究竟是“糟得很”还是好得很。
    1956年工业生产的发展，使我国工业产值的增长提前一年，并且超额9.5％完成了第一个五年计划规定的1957年的指标。其中电力的产量达到一百六十五点九亿度，原煤的产量达到一亿零五百九十二点二万吨，生铁的产量达到四百七十七点七万吨，钢材的产量达到三百九十二点一万吨，棉布的产量（不包括手工业）达到四十六亿公尺。这些也许都是很枯燥的数字；但是，每一个多少了解一些中国工业发展历史的人，只要不作昧心之言，就不能不承认这是一些惊人的数字。它同旧中国的工业水平相比，简直有天壤之别。1941年是解放前我国电力工业产量最高的一年，可是那一年的发电量才五十九点六亿度；1956年电力的产量同1941年相比，增加了179％。1942年是解放前我国煤炭工业产量最高的一年，可是那一年的原煤产量才六千多万吨；1956年原煤的产量同1942年相比，增加了71.2％。1943年是我国钢铁工业产量最高的一年，可是那一年的生铁产量才一百八十万吨左右；钢材的产量才六十八万吨左右；1956年生铁的产量同1943年相比，增加了165.2％，1956年钢材的产量同1943年相比增加了471.5％。1936年是我国棉布产量最高的一年，可是那一年的棉布产量也才十六点五亿公尺；1956年的棉布产量同1936年相比，增加了178.9％。特别值得指出的是，1949年全国大陆解放的时候，工业生产的水平比解放前最高年产量已经一落千丈了。例如生铁的产量只剩下二十四点六万吨，煤的产量只剩下三千多万吨。我们在这样微薄的工业基础上奋起直追，在短短几年的时间里，就把解放前最高年产量的水平远远地抛在后面。在这些确凿的材料面前，谁能否认我们建设的成绩是主要的呢！
    右派分子污蔑农业合作化“搞糟了”。事实怎么样呢？事实是去年虽然是农业合作化刚刚基本完成的一年，但是初生的农业生产合作社就已经在战胜自然灾害、争取农业丰收等方面表现出旺盛的生命力。大家知道，1956年农业的自然灾害是多方面的、严重的。许多地区遭受了水灾、台风和旱灾，受灾面积在二亿亩以上。受灾人口约五千多万人。不少农作物，特别是粮食、棉花受到相当大的损失。但是，由于1956年全国基本上实现了农业合作化，由于农田水利的建设，各种先进生产经验和生产措施的推广，大多数主要农作物的产量还是比1955年增加了。拿粮食总产量来说，仍比丰收的1955年增加了4.4％，提前一年达到第一个五年计划规定的1957年的指标。不可能设想，“糟得很”的农村怎么能够在农业生产上表现出这么大的力量？
    有人说：“生活水平提高了的，是过去穿破鞋，现在坐小卧车、穿呢子制服的党员和干部”。事实又怎么样呢？事实是去年全国职工平均工资比前年提高了14％，享受劳动保险的职工人数比前年增加了30％，享受公费医疗的职工人数比前年增加了11％。换句话说，去年职工的工资总额比前年增加了大约二十七亿元，享受劳动保险的职工人数达七百四十万人，享受公费医疗的职工人数达六百六十万人。另外，国家投资新建的职工住宅达二千五百万平方公尺。这些数字不正说明广大职工的生活是有保障的，生活水平是有所提高的吗？是不是“工人的生活好了，农民的生活苦了”呢？从公报里也可以看出，农民的收入同样有所增加。去年凡是没有受灾和受灾不大的地区，大约有80％左右的农业生产合作社增加了产量，大约有75％以上的农户增加了收入。灾区虽然减产或者收成很少，但是经过农业生产合作社组织生产自救，加上政府的援助，社员生活一般也得到保证。去年商业零售额比1955年提高19％，这也说明人民购买力的巨大增长。
    我们不准备列举公报中所有的数字，来一一驳斥反动谬论。任何正直的人，都可以从1956年的国民经济计划执行的结果里，看到共产党和共产党领导的国家，究竟有没有成绩？有多大成绩？试问历史上有哪一个政府能够在一年的时间里做出这么多的事情，得到这样大的成绩呢？
    当然，共产党和共产党领导的国家，从来不讳言自己工作中的缺点和错误。国家统计局的公报已经概括地指出了1956年国民经济计划的制定和执行中的缺点和错误。由于我们的主观认识同客观实际不完全一致，因而在计划的制定和执行中就不免发生了一些偏差，这就是基本建设投资计划大了一些，职工增加得多了一些，等等。这些工作上的缺点和错误，虽然给1957年的工作安排，带来了一些困难和不利的影响；但是同巨大的成绩相比，这些缺点和错误毕竟是次要的。右派分子企图抓住共产党和人民政府工作中的一些缺点和错误，煽动一部分人起来闹事，要“打倒”共产党和人民政府，他们的这种幻想现在是完全破产了。
    我们反对抹煞成绩，但是从来也不在成绩的面前陶醉；我们反对夸大缺点和错误，但是从来也不讳言缺点和错误，并且坚决纠正工作中的一切缺点和错误。我们的社会主义事业将在巩固成绩，纠正错误的基础上继续前进。今年上半年，我国的工人阶级在1956年胜利的基础上，又对完成国家计划作出了卓越的贡献，工业总产值比去年同期增加了10.8％。我们号召全国人民继续努力，深入开展增产节约运动，克服一切困难，努力全面完成和超额完成1957年度的国民经济计划，用实际行动来回击右派分子的对社会主义的挑战，把我们的社会主义事业继续向前推进！
