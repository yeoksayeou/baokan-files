　　The Second Grain Supply Station of Suichuan Street, Heping District, Shenyang City, adopted methods such as commendation platforms and visits to residents' homes to promote grain conservation and achieved remarkable results. From January to mid-August this year, 50% of households returned more than 12,000 jin of surplus grain coupons to the state.
