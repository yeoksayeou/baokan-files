    "Frugality in household management, frugality in running cooperatives, and frugality in building the nation are interconnected. Promoting the spirit of thrift and economy in agricultural cooperatives and conducting education on frugality in household management are very important for implementing the policy of frugality in running cooperatives and frugality in building the nation." This was the first statement made by Lu Hongbin, an agricultural labor model and director of the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, in response to a reporter's interview on frugality in household management. Comrade Lu Hongbin continued: If frugality in household management is not achieved, it will be difficult to achieve frugality in running the cooperative. For example, this spring, the members of the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative experienced a shortage of money and food. Three-quarters of the cooperative's sideline income was loaned to the members, with only one-quarter used for production. Some of the members who claimed to be short of money and food were genuinely in need, while others were simply not being thrifty, and still others were just complaining. Some members, unable to borrow money or food from the cooperative, would not work or would not work energetically, which directly affected production. The members borrowed money from the cooperative, and the cooperative borrowed money from the state, increasing the burden on the state. Wasting food also reduced the amount of grain purchased by the state. Wearing too much clothing and building houses that should not have been built would increase market tension. Comrade Lu Hongbin estimated that if families and the cooperative truly practiced frugality, the Aiguo Cooperative could borrow ten to twenty thousand yuan less from the state and sell tens of thousands of jin more of grain to the state.

    Comrade Lu Hongbin spoke of the painful past. At that time, in the Lü Family Village, which consisted of only twenty-odd households, more than half were either begging for food or migrating to the Northeast. Some people wore the same tattered cotton-padded coat for ten years, and some went without food for days. Driven by the hardships of life, the peasants developed the habit of thrift and frugality. "Preparing for famine every year" was the motto of every household. Only landlords and rich peasants, who obtained money through exploitation, would eat and drink extravagantly and squander it recklessly.

    After liberation, with the realization of cooperativization, the peasants' lives greatly improved. The three major issues of food, clothing, and housing were generally no longer a worry. In our cooperative, which has more than a thousand households, there are no more beggars and no more people with bare skin exposed. For peasants who had suffered for thousands of years, these days are considered good. However, some people began to forget the habit of thrift. Some said: "Life is all about eating and drinking, so let's eat, drink, and enjoy ourselves." A member of the Yan Village composed a little ditty: "Eat quickly, use quickly; if there's nothing to eat, go to the big granary (the cooperative's warehouse); if there's nothing to spend, go to the bank; if you're sick, go to the pharmacy." Wasteful phenomena developed. Last year, there was a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes, and some households used large quantities of them to feed pigs and donkeys, and children discarded leftover sweet potatoes everywhere. No one considered how to eat some thin porridge, mix in some bran and vegetables, and save some grain. Young people excessively pursued fashionable clothing, refusing to wear durable cloth socks and unwilling to wear clothes with patches. Savings in credit cooperatives also decreased.

    Why did this phenomenon occur? Comrade Lu Hongbin spoke about the shortcomings in the work. In recent years, cadres have paid attention to publicizing the happy life of socialism but have relaxed the publicity of hard struggle, frugality in household management, and frugality in building the nation. This has led some people to mistakenly believe that after cooperativization, they have ascended to heaven in one step, and everything must be done in a proper manner, and the cooperative should meet all the members' demands. They do not realize that the cooperative's foundation is weak and the country's foundation is poor, and we must carefully calculate and build step by step, and living standards can only be improved gradually.

    Comrade Lu Hongbin believes that it is necessary to conduct in-depth propaganda and education on frugality in household management within the cooperative. Good examples should be praised, and extravagant and wasteful phenomena should be criticized.

    Finally, Comrade Lu Hongbin spoke about the practices of the Aiguo Cooperative. Around the time of the wheat harvest this year, the cooperative began to educate on frugality in household management and improved unreasonable systems. Now, fewer people are borrowing money from the cooperative, and fewer people are complaining about food shortages.

    Lu Hongbin said that in the future, he intends to mobilize more women to do this work, as frugality in household management is most closely related to them. (Attached picture)

    吕鸿宾谈勤俭持家
　　本报记者
    “勤俭持家、勤俭办社、勤俭建国这三者是互相关连着的，在农业社里发扬省吃俭用的作风，开展勤俭持家的教育对贯彻勤俭办社、勤俭建国的方针，十分重要”。这是农业劳动模范、山东省莒县爱国农业社社长吕鸿宾，在回答记者关于勤俭持家的访问时的第一句话。吕鸿宾同志接着说：勤俭持家作不到，勤俭办社也难作到。像爱国农业社，今年春季社员闹钱紧、粮紧，社里的副业收入四分之三借给了社员，只有四分之一用于生产。闹粮紧钱紧的，有的是真紧，有的是因为不节约，有的是瞎嚷嚷。有些社员一时借不到钱、粮，就不干活或干活不带劲，这都直接影响了生产。社员借社的钱，社再借国家的钱，增加了国家的负担。多费了粮食，也减少了国家购粮的数量。布穿多了，房子不该盖的盖了，就会增加市场的紧张程度。吕鸿宾同志估计，如果家和社真正做到勤俭，爱国社少向国家借一两万元钱，多卖给国家几万斤粮还是可能的。
    吕鸿宾同志谈到痛苦的过去。那时候，二十多户的吕家庄，要饭的下关东的占一大半。有十年穿一件破棉袄的，有几天不见粮食的。在生活的逼迫下，农民养成了省吃俭用勤俭持家的习惯。“年年防荒”是家家户户的格言。只有地主富农剥削的钱来得容易，才大吃大喝胡花乱用。
    解放了，实现了合作化，农民的生活大大改善了，吃、穿、住三件大事一般不发愁了。我们这个一千多户的合作社，再也没有讨饭的了，再也没有赤皮露肉的了。苦了几千年的庄稼汉，这日子也算不错了。可是有些人开始忘了勤俭的习惯。有的说：“为人就是吃喝，吃点喝点享享福吧”。阎庄一个社员编了首小唱：“快些吃，快些扬（用）；没有吃，上大场（社的仓库）；没有花，上银行；病病恙恙上药房。”浪费的现象发展了。去年甘薯丰收，有些户大批的用它喂猪喂驴，孩子吃剩的地瓜遍地丢。再没人考虑怎样吃些稀饭，掺些糠菜，节省点粮食。青年人过多地讲求穿戴，不穿结实的布袜子，不愿穿带补钉的衣服。信贷社的存款也少了。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？吕鸿宾同志谈到了工作中的缺点。这几年，干部注意了宣传社会主义的幸福生活，却放松了艰苦奋斗、勤俭持家、勤俭建国的宣传。这就使有些人错误地认为，合作化以后就一步上了天，样样都得像个样，合作社应该满足社员的一切要求；不知道社的底子薄，国家的基础差，还得精打细算一步步地建设，生活只能慢慢地改善。
    吕鸿宾同志认为，应当在合作社内深入进行勤俭持家的宣传教育。好的典型要表扬，铺张浪费的现象要批评。
    最后，吕鸿宾同志谈到了爱国社的作法。今年麦收前后，社里着手进行了勤俭持家的教育，改善了不合理的制度。现在，向社借钱的少了，闹粮的也少了。
    吕鸿宾说，今后准备多发动妇女来作这件工作，勤俭持家同她们有最密切的关系。（附图片）
