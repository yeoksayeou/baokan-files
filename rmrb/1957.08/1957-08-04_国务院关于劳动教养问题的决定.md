    根据中华人民共和国宪法第一百条的规定，为了把游手好闲、违反法纪、不务正业的有劳动力的人，改造成为自食其力的新人；为了进一步维护公共秩序，有利于社会主义建设，对于劳动教养问题，作如下决定：
    一、对于下列几种人应当加以收容实行劳动教养：

    （4）不服从工作的分配和就业转业的安置，或者不接受从事劳动生产的劝导，不断地无理取闹、妨害公务、屡教不改的。
    二、劳动教养，是对于被劳动教养的人实行强制性教育改造的一种措施，也是对他们安置就业的一种办法。
    对于被劳动教养的人，应当按照其劳动成果发给适当的工资；并且可以酌量扣出其一部分工资，作为其家属赡养费或者本人安家立业的储备金。

    在教育管理方面，应当采用劳动生产和政治教育相结合的方针，并且规定他们必须遵守的纪律和制度，帮助他们建立爱国守法和劳动光荣的观念，学习劳动生产的技术，养成爱好劳动的习惯，使他们成为参加社会主义建设的自食其力的劳动者。
