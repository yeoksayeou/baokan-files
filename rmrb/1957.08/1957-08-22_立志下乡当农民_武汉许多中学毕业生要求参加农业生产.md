Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st. Wuhan city's graduating middle school students are eagerly signing up to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. Yesterday, after Wuhan's middle schools announced the admission lists for this year's entrance examinations, the vast majority of students who were not admitted were able to adopt a correct attitude towards their future paths. Many graduates have already signed up to participate in agricultural production. According to preliminary statistics from thirteen middle schools, more than three hundred high school and junior high school graduates have signed up or requested to go to the countryside to participate in production.

　　Walking into the various middle schools, one can feel a fervent atmosphere. Applications and declarations of resolve to go to the countryside, written on red and green paper, are plastered all over the walls. In front of the "Registration Station" written in large red characters, people are constantly coming to collect application forms to go to the countryside. The No. 2 Middle School of the city has not yet officially started registration, but twenty-six high school graduates have already expressed their determination to go to the countryside to participate in production. On the first day of registration at the No. 39 Girls' Middle School of the city, fifty-two graduates signed up, determined to return to the countryside as farmers. Nineteen graduates from the No. 37 Middle School of the city had already gone to the countryside to participate in agricultural production on August 8th, and now another forty people are requesting to go to the countryside. The Communist Youth League members in the graduating class also passed a resolution at the League branch meeting, submitting a guarantee to the school's Party branch and League general branch, stating that they would actively respond to the Party's call and become educated farmers.

　　Some graduates whose families are in the countryside have already set off for their hometowns. Seven people from the No. 30 Middle School of the city have already returned home to participate in production. Zhao Zhencai, the son of Zhao Tiefu, chairman of the city's Federation of Trade Unions, is a graduating high school student from the No. 2 Middle School of the city. He has firmly stated that if he is not admitted to university, he will return to his hometown in Hebei to participate in agricultural production.
