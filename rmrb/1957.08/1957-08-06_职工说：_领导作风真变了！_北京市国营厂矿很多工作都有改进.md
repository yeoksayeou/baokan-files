    Workers Say: "The Leadership Style Has Really Changed!"
    Many Works in Beijing's State-Owned Factories and Mines Have Been Improved

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing News: Over the past month or so, state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing have actively adopted measures to improve work and leadership style, and have achieved initial results.

    Under the leadership of the Party Committee, each factory and mine enterprise has established groups for cadre style, welfare, and counter-revolutionary issues, with leading cadres personally taking the lead to study and solve the problems that urgently need to be solved and can be solved at present.

    Go Deep into Reality, Go Deep into the Masses

    In terms of improving leadership style, all units have done a lot of work. Many units have formulated systems for going deep into reality and connecting with the masses. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant stipulates that cadres above the section chief level must spend no less than twelve hours per week on-site; the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant stipulates that members of the Party Committee should participate in the workshop cadre meetings to study work and visit dormitories once per quarter. Leading cadres of the Beijing Wire Factory recently spent four consecutive days dedicating half a day to go deep into the workshops to inspect work, identifying 402 problems, 110 of which were solved on the spot. After research, solutions have been proposed for 95% of the remaining problems, and specific personnel have been designated to be responsible for their implementation. For example, the furnace built in the forging and casting workshop was completed long ago, but could not be used because there was no place to build a chimney; the workers had been raising this issue for over a year without resolution. This time, it was decided on-site to redesign it, and it will soon be repaired. The masses responded very well after these problems were solved. Some said, "The leadership style has really changed."

    According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on leading cadres participating in physical labor, each unit has formulated a system and begun to implement it. Each person participates in physical labor for 8 to 16 hours per month, mostly participating in auxiliary labor in the workshops (such as transportation, etc.), some participating in service labor (such as selling meal tickets, washing dishes, cleaning, etc.), some participating in some small-scale civil engineering projects (such as road repair, land leveling, etc.), and some working as apprentices to learn technology. After the leading cadres participated in physical labor, the relationship between the leaders and the masses became closer; at the same time, some problems were solved quickly because the leaders went deep into reality. For example, the Beijing Municipal Telephone Bureau has more than one hundred line workers working outside every day. In the past, because the canteen did not prepare dry food, they had to buy lunch outside. The workers had raised this issue without resolution; after the leading cadres went to the lines to participate in labor and experienced it firsthand, they immediately solved the problem.

    All units have paid more attention to consulting with the masses on matters. The coercive command style of middle and lower-level cadres has been changed relatively universally. The workshop director of a factory, Li Shiyong, has recently undergone a great change in his style, and the masses reflect that "the director is simply a different person compared to the past." Some units have publicly criticized a few cadres who have a bad style, are very dissatisfied with the masses, and are unwilling to correct their mistakes, and are preparing to transfer them from their original positions.

    Abolish Unreasonable Treatments

    The unreasonable treatments of some leading cadres have been abolished by all units. The phenomenon of taking cars for personal matters is gone, and the small canteens of some units have been cancelled. A few individual leading cadres in a small number of units used to receive excessive subsidies or received subsidies that they should not have received. Now these comrades have expressed their willingness to return them, and some have already returned them. In terms of bonuses, many enterprises used to have a leadership cadre reward system, and the bonuses were higher than those of ordinary workers. Now all units have abolished this system.

    In addition, the unreasonable privileges that leaders of a few units used to have, such as sitting in the front row when watching plays, having special personnel deliver meals, having special personnel cut hair, and having special personnel guard dormitories, have all been abolished. The Beijing Railway Administration used to stipulate that only the children of cadres with twelve years of revolutionary work experience, section chiefs, and above could attend the experimental primary school run by the bureau, and the fees were lower. Now it has been decided to convert this primary school into an ordinary primary school for the children of workers. Some leading cadres used to have relatively spacious housing, which the workers had opinions about. Leading cadres from units such as the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory and the North China Radio Equipment Factory have now vacated some houses for workers to live in.

    Improve Workers' Lives as Much as Possible

    Regarding the issues of welfare raised by the workers, the units on the one hand explained to the workers that it was impossible to demand that all wage and welfare issues be resolved in a short period of time, and on the other hand, they tried to solve those issues that urgently needed to be resolved and could be resolved. According to the statistics of seven units including the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, the workers raised a total of 836 opinions related to welfare and labor protection. 577 of them have now been resolved, and the rest are being studied for resolution.

    The masses are most concerned about housing problems. Some units have built some dormitories within the scope permitted by the state; many units have repaired dilapidated houses. The Jingxi Mining Bureau had 1,180 dormitories leaking, and 1,104 of them have now been repaired, which did not cost much money, and the workers responded very well. Some units have adjusted the existing dormitories. The Xinhua Printing Factory, the First Automobile Parts Factory, and other units also specially convened a congress of worker representatives to solicit everyone's opinions on improving accommodation and housing allocation. Many units have improved canteen management, added some equipment, and improved canteen conditions. In order to enable underground workers to eat hot meals, the Chengzi Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau delivers meals to the three shifts of workers every day, which is very popular among the workers. Some improvements have also been made in aspects such as disease treatment, labor protection, nurseries, and bathrooms.

    The units have also made urgent efforts to deal with the issue of demobilized soldiers' wages and the issue of apprentice workers becoming full-time workers.

    Properly Carry out Follow-up Work on Purges

    The units have also properly carried out follow-up work on counter-revolutionary suppression. In the counter-revolutionary suppression movement, 35 state-owned industrial and mining enterprises investigated a group of counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements among the 120,000 workers participating in the movement, making the ranks of workers purer; more people with major political problems or general political problems were investigated and clarified. Therefore, the achievements are fundamental. However, there were also some errors and shortcomings, mainly: a small number of good people were wrongly criticized, some conclusions were not appropriate or inaccurate, and some struggle methods were crude. After the end of the counter-revolutionary suppression movement, the units conducted two reviews and follow-up work, and these problems have basically been resolved. Recently, the objects of the counter-revolutionary investigation have been reviewed one by one, and talks have been held with each person to solicit opinions on the counter-revolutionary suppression. After this follow-up work, the vast majority of people expressed satisfaction; only a small number of people still had opinions, and the units are continuing to carry out follow-up work.

    In order to further improve work, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all factories and mines to continue to rank existing problems and seize the time to solve them; at the same time, it requires all factories and mines to convene a congress of worker representatives in the near future to report on the situation and opinions of the increase production and practice economy movement and the handling of these problems, and to solicit the opinions of the workers and masses in order to better rely on the masses, improve work, and improve leadership.

### 职工说：“领导作风真变了！”  北京市国营厂矿很多工作都有改进

    职工说：“领导作风真变了！”
    北京市国营厂矿很多工作都有改进
    本报讯　北京市国营工矿企业最近一个多月来，积极采取措施改进工作，改进领导作风，已有初步成绩。
    各厂矿企业都在党委领导下，成立了干部作风、生活福利、肃反问题等小组，由领导干部亲自动手，分头研究和解决目前急需解决而又可能解决的问题。
    深入实际　深入群众
    在改进领导作风方面，各单位都作了许多工作。许多单位制定了深入实际、联系群众的制度。石景山钢铁厂规定科长以上干部每周下现场不得少于十二小时；北京第一机床厂规定党委委员分工参加车间干部会研究工作，每季访问一次宿舍。北京有线电厂领导干部最近一连四天都用半天时间深入车间检查工作，查出四百零二个问题，当时解决了一百一十个，其余经过研究，95％已经提出了解决办法，并指定了专人负责执行。例如，锻铸工段修建的炉子早已完工，因为没有地方砌烟囱不能使用，工人提意见一年多没有解决；这次在现场研究决定重新设计，很快就可修好。这些问题解决后，群众反映很好。有的说：“领导作风真变了。”
    根据中共中央关于领导干部参加体力劳动的指示，各单位已经订出制度，开始执行。每人每月参加体力劳动八至十六小时，多数参加车间的辅助劳动（如搬运等），有的参加服务性劳动（如卖饭票、洗碗、打扫卫生等），有的参加一些小型土木建筑工程（如修路、平土等），有的当学徒学技术。领导干部参加体力劳动以后，领导和群众的关系更加密切；同时由于领导深入实际，有些问题也解决得快了。例如，北京市内电话局有一百多名线路工人每天在外边工作，过去因为食堂不给准备干粮，午饭只得在外边买着吃，工人提过意见也没有解决；领导干部到线路上去参加劳动亲身体验以后，马上就把这个问题解决了。
    各单位都更加注意了有事同群众商量。中下层干部的强迫命令作风，比较普遍地有了改变。某厂车间主任李世永最近作风有很大转变，群众反映：“主任同过去比，简直是两个人。”有些单位对于少数作风恶劣、群众十分不满、又不愿改正错误的干部，当众进行了批评，并且准备把他们调离原来的工作岗位。
    取消不合理的待遇
    部分领导干部的某些不合理的待遇，各单位都取消了。因私事坐小汽车的现象没有了，一些单位的小食堂取消了。少数单位的个别领导干部过去曾经多领补助金或者不该领而领了补助金，现在这些同志已经表示愿意退出，有的已经退还。在奖金方面，不少企业过去都有领导干部奖励制度，而且奖金比一般职工多。现在各单位都取消了这种制度。
    此外，少数单位的领导干部过去看戏坐前排，专人送饭，专人理发，专人看守宿舍，这种不合理的照顾，现在都已取消。北京铁路管理局过去规定，具有十二年革命工作经历、科长、处长以上干部的子弟才能入该局所办的实验小学读书，收费较少，现在已经决定将这个小学改为普通职工子弟小学。少数领导干部过去住房比较宽裕，职工有意见。北京电子管厂、华北无线电器材厂等单位的领导干部，现在已经腾出一些房屋供职工居住。
    尽可能地改善职工生活
    关于职工提出的生活福利方面的问题，各单位一方面向职工说明不可能要求在短时间中解决所有工资福利问题的道理，一方面尽可能解决那些急需解决而又可能解决的问题。根据第一机床厂等七个单位的统计，职工共提出有关生活福利、劳动保护方面的意见八百三十六件，现在已经解决了五百七十七件，其余正在研究解决中。
    群众对住房问题最关心。有些单位在国家允许范围内修建了一些宿舍；不少单位都对破漏房屋进行了修理。京西矿务局有一千一百八十间宿舍漏雨，现已修好了一千一百零四间，花钱不多，职工反映很好。有些单位对原有宿舍做了调整。新华印刷厂、第一汽车附件厂等单位还专门为宿舍问题召开了职工代表大会，征求大家对于改进住宿和房屋分配的意见。　　不少单位改进了食堂管理，增添了一些设备，改善了食堂条件。京西矿务局城子矿为了使井下工人吃到热饭，每天给三班工人送饭，很受工人欢迎。在疾病医疗、劳动保护和托儿所、浴室等方面，也采取了一些改进措施。
    关于复员军人工资问题和学徒工转正问题，各单位也抓紧做了处理。
    妥善进行肃反善后工作
    各单位还妥善进行了肃反善后工作。在肃反运动中，三十五个国营工矿企业在参加运动的十二万职工中，查出了一批反革命分子和其他坏分子，使工人队伍更加纯洁了；查出和查清了更多的有重大政治问题或有一般政治问题的人，因此，成绩是基本的。但也有若干错误和缺点，主要是：斗错了少数好人，有的结论不够恰当或者不确切，有的斗争方式粗暴。肃反运动结束以后，各单位曾经进行过两次复查和善后工作，这些问题基本上都已经解决了。最近，又对肃反清查对象逐一进行了复查，并和每个人进行了谈话，征求对肃反的意见。经过这次善后工作以后，绝大部分人表示满意；只有少数人还有意见，各单位正在继续进行善后工作。
    为了进一步改进工作，中共北京市委要求各厂矿企业继续把现有问题排队，抓紧解决；同时，要求各厂矿企业在最近召开职工代表大会，报告增产节约运动和处理这些问题的情况和意见，征求职工群众的意见，以便更好地依靠群众，改进工作，改进领导。
