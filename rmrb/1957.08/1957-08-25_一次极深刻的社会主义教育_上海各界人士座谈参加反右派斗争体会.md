Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 24th: Eighteen figures from various circles in Shanghai yesterday shared their experiences in participating in the struggle against bourgeois rightists at a symposium jointly convened by Shanghai's newspapers. They are all representatives attending the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress currently in session.

The renowned dramatist Zhou Xinfang said that this anti-Rightist struggle had given him a very profound socialist education. He said that from the exposed ugly words and deeds of the rightists, he recognized their reactionary essence and increased his vigilance. The veteran translator Luo Ji-nan said that at this Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, the method of presenting facts and reasoning with the rightists to clarify major issues of right and wrong encouraged originally progressive intellectuals, and also helped those in an intermediate state to improve their understanding and distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. Economist Li Binghuan also felt that he had received another vivid exercise in class struggle, which could never be obtained by simply reading a few books.

Most of the speakers mentioned that the anti-Rightist struggle had made them more aware of the necessity of ideological remolding for intellectuals. The medical scientist Hu Maolian said that it is dangerous for intellectuals to lack a correct class stand, and their knowledge would not benefit the people. Some rightists also have professional knowledge, but because their position is reactionary, their professional knowledge harms the socialist cause instead. Yan Duhe, who worked in the press for many years, analyzed that before the anti-Rightist struggle, he could not clearly distinguish the remarks of many rightists, and the key was that he had not thoroughly transformed himself, and there was a problem with his class stand. Chemical engineer Lu Shilu, in his speech, regarded recognizing the importance of self-remolding of intellectuals as a major gain from this struggle. He expressed that he would better integrate with the workers in the future.

The people who spoke at the symposium were exceptionally diverse. Combining their personal experiences and encounters, comparing and understanding the profound changes in various aspects of the country before and after liberation, they also talked about the far-reaching impact of the anti-Rightist struggle on all strata of society. Chen Jianzhen, a well-known figure in religious circles, said that for religious circles, this anti-Rightist struggle is actually a continuation of the struggle between the two lines within religious circles. In the early days of liberation, it was a struggle between patriotic religious believers and imperialist elements in religious circles. Later, it was a struggle between religious believers and counter-revolutionary elements hidden within religious circles. Now, it is to push this struggle deeper in order to completely eliminate the influence of imperialism in Chinese religious circles. Tao Minzhi, a young industrialist and businessman, said that there are many young capitalists in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles. They believe that they are easy to transform, and in this struggle they realized that as members of the bourgeoisie, ideological remolding is not a simple process, and the joint state-private ownership of enterprises is by no means the completion of the bourgeoisie's transformation. She expressed that she would actively participate in the rectification campaign and anti-Rightist struggle in the industrial and commercial circles and actively transform herself.

　　一次极深刻的社会主义教育
　　上海各界人士座谈参加反右派斗争体会
    新华社上海24日电　十八位上海各界人士昨天在上海各报共同召开的座谈会上，畅谈了自己参加这次反对资产阶级右派分子斗争的体会。他们都是出席正在举行的上海市人民代表大会的代表。
    著名的戏剧家周信芳谈到这次反右派斗争给了自己一次很深刻的社会主义教育。他说，他从揭露出的右派分子丑恶言行中认清了他们的反动本质，提高了自己的警惕性。老翻译家罗稷南说，这次上海市人代会上，采用跟右派分子摆事实、讲道理的方式，辩明大是大非，使原来进步的知识分子得到了鼓励，中间状态的人也提高认识，分清了敌我。经济学家李炳焕也感到自己又受到一次生动的阶级斗争锻炼，这是决非读几本书可以获得的。
    大部分人在发言中都提到反右派斗争使自己更加认识知识分子思想改造的必要。医学家胡懋廉说，知识分子没有正确的阶级立场是危险的，他的知识对人民也就没有好处。有些右派分子也有专业知识，因为立场反动，他的专业知识反而危害社会主义事业。曾在新闻界任职多年的严独鹤分析了自己在反右派斗争以前，对许多右派分子的言论辨认不清，关键就在于自己没有彻底改造，阶级立场有问题。化学工程师卢世鲁在讲话中，把认清知识分子自我改造的重要性作为这次斗争的一个主要收获。他表示今后要同工人更好地结合起来。
    在座谈会上发言的人异常广泛，他们结合自己亲身的经历和遭遇，对比了解放前后国家各方面的深刻变化，也谈到反右派斗争对各阶层的深远影响。宗教界知名人士陈见真说，这次反右派斗争对宗教界说来，实际上就是宗教界内部两条路线斗争的继续。解放初期是爱国教徒和宗教界帝国主义分子的斗争，以后是教徒和隐藏在宗教界内部的反革命分子的斗争，现在是把这斗争推向深入，以彻底肃清帝国主义在中国宗教界的影响。工商界青年陶敏之谈到，上海工商界中有许多青年资本家，他们认为自己容易改造，在这次斗争中体会到作为资产阶级的成员，思想改造不是简单的过程，企业的公私合营决不是资产阶级改造的完成。她表示，要积极投入这次工商界的整风和反右派斗争，积极改造自己。
