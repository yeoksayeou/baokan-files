The congress will be held in Kyiv from August 16th to 22nd.

Bernini said that the congress will summarize the work of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and determine new tasks. Approximately 400 delegates will participate in the congress. In order to establish new cooperative relationships with other international organizations, the federation has decided that all international organizations and national organizations can send observers to the congress. Prominent individuals engaged in youth issues or interested in youth issues can also participate as observers or guests.

Bernini announced that more than 100 youth organizations that are not yet members of the World Federation of Democratic Youth have already expressed their agreement to send representatives to the congress. More than 40 of these youth organizations are from Latin America, more than 40 are from Asia and Africa, and 25 are from Southeast Asia.

The Youth Wing of the Indian National Congress, the Youth Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party, the Socialist Parties of Brazil and Chile, as well as youth organizations from countries such as Malaya, Indonesia, Egypt, Sudan, and Argentina, will send observers to the congress.

Bernini also mentioned that the World Federation of Democratic Youth now has 250 member organizations, representing 85 million young men and women from various countries. This number is almost twice as large as when the federation was first established.

    促使各国政府走和平的道路
    世界民主青联将开代表大会
    新华社莫斯科9日电　世界民主青年联盟主席柏尼尼8月8日在这里举行的记者招待会上指出，和平问题将成为第四届世界民主青年联盟代表大会的中心问题。他说，在促使各国政府走和平的道路方面，各国青年组织的互相接触具有特别的意义。
    这次大会将于8月16日到22日在基辅市举行。
    柏尼尼说，这次代表大会将总结世界民主青年联盟的工作和确定新的任务。参加这次大会的将约有四百名代表。为了和其他国际组织建立新的合作关系，联盟决定，所有的国际组织和全国性的组织都可以派观察员参加大会。从事青年问题或者对青年问题有兴趣的著名人士也可以作为观察员或来宾参加。
    柏尼尼宣布，有一百多个还未成为世界民主青年联盟会员的青年组织已经表示同意派遣它们的代表参加大会。这些青年组织中有四十多个是拉丁美洲的，有四十多个是亚洲和非洲的，有二十五个是东南亚的。
    印度的国大党、日本社会党的青年部、巴西和智利的社会党，以及马来亚、印度尼西亚、埃及、苏丹、阿根廷等国家的青年组织都将派观察员参加大会。
    柏尼尼还提到，世界民主青年联盟现在拥有二百五十个会员组织，代表着各国的八千五百万男女青年。这个数字差不多比联盟刚成立的时候多两倍。
