    Attempting to Abolish Party Leadership and Implement So-Called "Artist-Managed Institute"
    Zhao Yue Rightist Clique Criticized by the Masses

    (Our Dispatch) The rightist clique headed by Zhao Yue, director of the Organization Section of the Central Mass Art Center, has been exposed and is now surrounded by the masses.

    Zhao Yue is a rightist element disguised as an "artist." He joined the Kuomintang before liberation and has consistently been dissatisfied with the new society since liberation. Within the institute, he frequently used double-dealing tactics to sow discord and damage the relationship between the Party and the masses. After the rectification campaign began, he colluded with rightist elements in the institute such as Zhao Yunpeng and Zheng Baoyun to launch a planned and organized attack on the Party.

    They attacked the Party's mass art work policy, and conspired to change the organization of the Mass Art Center to seize the Party's leadership. They denounced the Party's leading cadres at the Art Center, the Art Bureau, and the Ministry of Culture as "stumbling blocks" to the development of the Art Center, and proposed an organizational plan of "artist-managed institute," which in effect abolished the Party's leadership. According to this plan, a so-called "Art Committee" would be established in the Art Center as a "decision-making body." The members of this committee would all be "artists," and the "artists" he wanted to invite at the time were Sun Jiaxiu and Xu Bu, rightist elements from the China National Democratic League at the Central Academy of Drama.

    In order to realize his plan, he first took advantage of the dissatisfaction of some of the masses in the institute with the housing problem and incited the masses to organize and make trouble at the Ministry of Culture. At this time, Zhao Yue, in collusion with Zhao Yunpeng, Zheng Baoyun, and others, organized three groups to attack the Party. The "propaganda group" specialized in writing big-character posters and reactionary articles to "appeal to society"; the "investigation group" specialized in collecting shortcomings in the work as propaganda material; and the "liaison group" was responsible for contacting rightist elements in society and mass art centers across the country in order to create a situation of a comprehensive attack on the Ministry of Culture.

    With the development of the anti-rightist struggle, the rightist elements such as Zhao Yue have been exposed by the masses. All personnel from the Mass Art Center and the Art Bureau of the Ministry of Culture have conducted nine face-to-face reasoning struggles with him, fully exposing and powerfully criticizing Zhao Yue and others' conspiratorial activities of inciting the masses to attack the Party.

    妄图取消党的领导，实行所谓“艺术家治馆”
    赵越右派集团受到群众批判
    本报讯  中央群众艺术馆以组织室主任赵越为首的一个右派小集团已被揭露，并已陷入群众的重围。
    赵越是一个披着“艺术家”外衣的右派分子，解放前曾参加国民党，解放后一贯对新社会不满。在馆内平时就经常用两面手法，挑拨离间，破坏党群关系。整风开始后，他更伙同馆内右派分子赵云鹏、郑宝云等，有组织、有计划地向党进攻。
    他们攻击党的群众艺术工作方针，密谋改变群众艺术馆的组织，夺取党的领导。他们把从艺术馆到艺术局到文化部三级党员领导干部都骂作艺术馆事业发展的“绊脚石”，并提出了一个实际上取消党的领导的“艺术家治馆”的组织方案。根据这个方案，要在艺术馆里建立一个所谓“艺术委员会”，作为“决策机构”。这个委员会的委员都由“艺术家”担任，而他当时所要邀请的“艺术家”，就是中央戏剧学院的孙家琇、徐步等民盟右派分子。
    为了实现他的计划，他首先利用馆内一部分群众对住房问题的不满，鼓动群众组织起来，到文化部去闹。这时，赵越伙同赵云鹏、郑宝云等组织了三个向党进攻的小组。“宣传组”专门撰写大字报和反动文章，向“社会上呼吁”；“调查组”专门搜集工作中的缺点，供作宣传资料；“联络组”专门负责与社会上的右派分子以及全国各地群众艺术馆进行联络，以便造成全面向文化部进攻的局势。
    随着反右派斗争的开展，赵越等右派分子已被群众揭发。群众艺术馆和文化部艺术局的全体人员，已先后同他进行了九次面对面的说理斗争，对赵越等煽动群众向党进攻的阴谋活动，作了全面的揭发和有力的批判。
