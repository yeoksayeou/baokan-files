　　Love the Country—Love the Collective—Love the Family
　　Yixing County Party Committee Convenes Old Farmers to Exchange Experiences
　　Educating Peasants to Run Collectives Thriftily and Manage Households Thriftily
    Nanjing Dispatch from this newspaper: The Yixing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province recently convened a meeting of old farmer representatives to exchange experiences in running collectives thriftily and managing households thriftily. Based on the opinions of the old farmer representatives, the Yixing County Committee will conduct a widespread education campaign in rural areas on running collectives thriftily and managing households thriftily.
    The one hundred and ninety-three representatives attending this meeting were all elderly people over fifty years old. They had tasted all the bitterness and hardships in the old society and had the deepest appreciation for the benefits of the new society. Therefore, they were very dissatisfied with the extravagance and waste currently present in some agricultural cooperatives in rural areas. At the meeting, they criticized the erroneous thinking of some cooperative members, especially some young cooperative members, who believed that “now that we have socialism, there is no need to talk about hard work and frugality anymore.” These people, with an attitude of eating and using everything up, only sought enjoyment and did not emphasize thrift, and complained about the Party and the government at the slightest dissatisfaction. Last year, Meiyuan Cooperative in Tongfeng Township had a bumper harvest, with an average actual distribution of five to six hundred yuan per household, but 80.1% of the cooperative members overspent, and they didn’t have money to buy back the vegetable cakes and fertilizers supplied by the state. Why? It turned out that they thought they were going to live a socialist life. The entire cooperative consumed more than five thousand catties of cigarettes and alcohol just around the autumn harvest; 60% of the cash distributed to the cooperative members was used for food and clothing. The old farmers said that many cooperative members have the idea of "asking the collective for food when there is none" when it comes to eating grain, with no planning or forethought. An old farmer from Yuzhong Cooperative in Guijing Township, Shanjuan District, reflected that the Liu Defa family next door to him, with two adults and two children, in addition to rations, the cooperative also provided him with 163 catties of flexible grain, 120 catties of rice seeds, and 50 catties of wheat, but now he still says he has nothing to eat. This old farmer said: "My family also has four people, with only one child, but the rations we received are more than enough until the next autumn harvest." The old farmers said: In the past, when we were working individually, which farmer didn't save money on food and expenses, selling the surplus grain to exchange for fertilizer to enrich the fields? Now that we have joined the cooperative, we don't care if there is enough fertilizer, how can this work? In order to establish a good atmosphere of running collectives thriftily, the old farmers suggested that cooperatives should increase income and reduce expenditure in all aspects, and sell as much grain as possible to the state, on the one hand to support national construction, and on the other hand to buy more fertilizer to enrich the fields. Members of Cooperative No. 1 in Fucai Township calculated an account: Selling more than 25,000 catties of wheat can be exchanged for more than 12,000 catties of chemical fertilizer, which can be used as top dressing for rice. When the rice is harvested, in addition to recovering all the capital, more than 37,000 catties of rice can be harvested.
    Regarding the issue of running households thriftily, the old farmers suggested: We must work diligently, save money on food and expenses, and make the money last. "Look at the situation when eating, look at the family property when dressing," the improvement of life cannot exceed the development of production. "Saving rice should start from the rice pile, saving firewood should start from the firewood pile," saving must start from the beginning. In terms of eating grain, the old farmers' experience is: There is less farm work in winter, so you can eat thinner porridge; people who work and people who don't work cannot share grain equally; there must be a plan to eat substitute foods. The old farmers suggested launching a campaign to formulate plans for running households thriftily within the cooperative, so that everyone has a plan for living. Sun Longxiao from Tongguan District said: Women are very important in the family, 'A good man, a good woman, a good family', I hope to convene a women's representative meeting to exchange experiences in running households thriftily."

　　爱国—爱社—爱家
　  宜兴县委召集老农交谈经验
　　教育农民勤俭办社、勤俭持家
    本报南京讯　中共江苏省宜兴县委不久以前召开老农代表会议，交流了勤俭办社和勤俭持家的经验。宜兴县委根据老农代表的意见，将在农村中普遍进行一次勤俭办社、勤俭持家的教育。
    参加这次会议的一百九十三位代表都是年逾半百的老年人。他们在旧社会尝尽了辛酸苦辣，对新社会的好处体会最深。因此，他们对目前农村中一些农业社的铺张浪费现象很不满意。在会上，他们批判了一些社员特别是一些青年社员认为“社会主义了，再不要讲艰苦朴素了”的错误想法。这些人抱着吃光用光的态度，只图享受，不讲勤俭，稍不如意，就埋怨党和政府。铜峰乡梅园社去年大丰收，每户平均实分五、六百元，却有80.1％的社员超支，国家供应的菜饼、化肥也没钱买回来。为什么呢？原来他们以为要过社会主义的生活了，全社仅秋收前后吃掉的烟酒就有五千多斤；分给社员的现金，60％都用在吃穿上面去了。老农们谈到：在吃粮上，许多社员存在着“没有就向社要”的想法，无打算、无计划。善卷区归径乡余中社一位老农反映，他隔壁的刘德法家四口人，二大二小，除了口粮，社里还照顾他机动粮一百六十三斤，分给稻种一百二十斤，小麦五十斤，可是现在他还说没有吃的。这位老农说：“我家也是四口人，只有一个小孩，但分的口粮吃到接秋还有多余。”老农们说：过去单干的时候，哪一个农民不是省吃俭用，把多余的粮食卖出，换回肥料垩田呢？现在参加了合作社，就不管肥料够不够了，这哪能行呢？为了树立起勤俭办社的风尚，老农们建议：合作社应该从各方面开源节流，尽可能多卖些粮食给国家，一方面支援国家建设，一方面可以多买些肥料垩田。富材乡一社的社员算了一笔账：出售二万五千多斤麦，可换回一万二千多斤化肥，作为水稻追肥。到收稻时，除可收回全部本钱外，还可多收三万七千多斤稻子。
    对于勤俭持家的问题，老农们提出：要勤劳生产、省吃俭用、细水长流。“吃饭看来方，穿衣看家当”，生活的改善不能超过生产的发展。“省米要从米堆上省，省柴要从柴堆上省”，节约要从头做起。在吃粮方面，老农的经验是：冬天农活少，可吃得稀点；劳动与不劳动的人不能同等分粮；要有计划地搭吃代食品。老农们建议在社内发动订勤俭持家计划，让大家过日子有个打算。铜官区孙龙小说：妇女在家庭里很重要，‘男好一个，女好一家’，希望召开妇女代表会，交流勤俭持家的经验。”（附图片）
    经过社会主义教育后，农村里掀起了节约粮食的良好风气。这是山西省榆次县王村农业社副主任武福英（左一）和社员高月娥正在讨论怎样调剂粗细粮，使一家吃的又好、又饱、又节约粮食。
