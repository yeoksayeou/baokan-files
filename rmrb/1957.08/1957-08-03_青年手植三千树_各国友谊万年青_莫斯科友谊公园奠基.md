Youth Plant Three Thousand Trees, May the Friendship Between Countries Last Forever
Moscow Friendship Park Foundation Laid

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd - Delegates from various countries participating in the festival planted three thousand Friendship Trees in Friendship Park on August 1st.

Friendship Park is located in Khimki, near the Moscow Canal. It was originally a wasteland, but sixty hectares have been set aside to build Friendship Park in commemoration of this festival.

At 5:00 PM, more than 2,500 youth representatives from various countries and 500 Soviet youth representatives arrived at the site one after another. The flags of various countries fluttered in the park, and colorful flowers at the entrance formed a huge festival emblem. Young Pioneers and thousands of Moscow citizens lined up at the entrance of this future park to welcome the distinguished guests.

When the planting representatives were all present, four Young Pioneers with red scarves blew bugles, and Young Pioneer Andryusha reported to the representatives that the tree planting preparations had been completed. The youth from various countries then went to various corners of the park to plant trees. Soviet youth first planted five oak trees at the entrance of the park. The five trees symbolize the five continents, and the oak trees signify the eternal friendship of the youth of all countries.

The Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, Shelepin, children's writer Kassil, and the author of the novel "Russian Forest," Leonov, also came to plant trees with the youth of various countries. The name of the planter must be left on each tree. Each tree will be specially cared for by a Young Pioneer. Okitoue, a black man from West Africa, personally planted a poplar tree, and Nina, a fifth-grade student from Elementary School No. 777, who is responsible for caring for this tree, handed him a guarantee, solemnly promising to make this Friendship Tree grow tall.

Hu Yaobang, the head of the Chinese delegation, also participated in the tree planting. He and Razdukhov, a member of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, jointly planted a fir tree. The Chinese youth representatives planted saplings on both sides of an avenue, named the avenue Chinese Avenue, and wrote on the trees the words "Our Friendship Will Last Forever." (Attached picture)

    青年手植三千树  各国友谊万年青
    莫斯科友谊公园奠基
    据新华社莫斯科2日电　参加联欢节的各国代表们8月1日在友谊公园栽种了三千棵友谊树。
    友谊公园位于靠近莫斯科运河的希姆基，原先是一片荒地，为了纪念本届联欢节，而辟出六十公顷来建筑友谊公园。
    下午五时，二千五百多名各国青年代表和五百名苏联青年代表陆续到达场地。公园里各国的旗帜在迎风招展，入口处各色鲜花组成了巨大的联欢节徽。少先队员们和成千的莫斯科市民们排列在这个未来公园的入口，迎候贵宾。
    当植树的代表们到齐后，四个带红领巾的少先队员吹起了铜号，少先队员安德留莎向代表们报告植树准备工作已经完成。各国青年随后分头到公园的各个角落去植树。苏联青年首先在公园的入口处栽种了五棵橡树。五棵树象征着五大洲，橡树意味着各国青年永恒的友谊。
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央书记谢列平、儿童作家卡西尔、小说“俄罗斯森林”的作者列昂诺夫也来和各国青年一道植树。每棵树上都要留下种树人的名字。每棵树都要由一位少先队员专门负责养护。西非洲的黑人奥金图埃亲手种下了一棵杨树，负责养护这棵树的第七七七小学五年级学生尼娜交给他一个保证书，庄严地保证要使这棵友谊树长大。
    中国代表团团长胡耀邦也参加了植树，他和苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员拉兹杜霍夫合种了一株枞树。中国的青年代表在一条林荫路的两旁种上了树苗，他们把这条路命名为中国林荫路，并且在树上写下了“我们的友谊万年长青”几个大字。（附图片）
