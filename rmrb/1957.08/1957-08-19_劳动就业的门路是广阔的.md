    The Avenues for Labor Employment are Broad
    By Our Staff Commentator
    Currently, there are still some unemployed and jobless people in society who are seeking employment. Can the state meet their demands? What avenues for employment are there? These are issues of concern to everyone.
    Our Party and state have always attached great importance to the issue of labor employment. In the early days after the national liberation, there were approximately three million unemployed people in society. The millions of personnel in the Kuomintang reactionary ruling institutions also faced the risk of unemployment. The Party and state adopted a "take-all" policy towards the old personnel left over from the Kuomintang institutions, saving them from unemployment. With the recovery and development of the national economy and the basic completion of socialist transformation, the number of employees in our country has increased from approximately eight million in the early days of liberation to over 24 million in 1956. Among them, more than four million were unemployed people and newly grown youth who were placed in jobs through labor departments. The unemployed people left over from the old society have basically been settled. The number of people employed and the speed of increase are unprecedented in the history of our country, and rare in the world. This achievement fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system, and any pessimistic or doubtful attitude towards labor employment is unfounded.
    However, this is by no means to say that there are no problems in labor employment at present. Labor employment in our country is still a long-term and major issue that requires the state to solve with all its strength. This is because, first, our original economic foundation was very backward, and the current level of production is not high, so the capacity of enterprises and institutions to absorb personnel is limited to a certain extent. Second, our country is a large country with a population of over 600 million, and the natural population growth rate is very high. It is estimated that about one million young people in cities above the secondary level enter the working age every year. Third, there are still some unemployed and jobless people remaining in society. Thus, the number of people seeking employment each year exceeds the number of employees that can be employed. Therefore, it is obviously impossible to arrange for all those seeking employment by the state in the shortest possible time. Of course, it is even more impossible to arrange for all unemployed and jobless people to be placed in cities and industrial and mining areas.
    The unemployed and jobless people in the cities should seek employment opportunities from various aspects. The main way to solve labor employment in the future is to participate in agricultural production. Those whose homes are in the countryside can return home to participate in agricultural production; high school and middle school graduates whose homes are in the cities can also go to the countryside to become educated farmers. Recently, various localities have mobilized some students to participate in agricultural production cooperatives, which has been generally welcomed by the peasants. Handicraft and service industries are also an important auxiliary aspect of labor employment. In addition, street nurseries, cultural and technical supplementary classes, etc., are all good avenues for employment.
    The avenues for labor employment are broad. However, at present, some unemployed and jobless people tend to rely solely on the government and make excessive demands. They demand to stay in the city and not go to other places; they only want to do permanent work and not temporary work; they only want to engage in mental labor and not physical labor; they only want to do light work and not heavy work; they only want to do clean work and not dirty work; they only want to do high-paying work and not low-paying work. Some people are picky in every way and cannot be assigned work for a long time. In Beijing, some people have even been assigned work as many as thirteen times, but still do not accept the job. Obviously, this situation is a major obstacle to solving the problem of labor employment from various aspects. The labor departments in various localities should explain this clearly to these people. The newspapers and periodicals and enthusiastic people from all walks of life in various localities should also assist the government in doing this work well. It should be told to these people that every citizen should enjoy the right to work, and the government also has the responsibility to arrange for the employment of the unemployed and jobless people and seek a way out for their lives. However, every unemployed and jobless person has even more responsibility to accept the government's assignment, and at the same time actively seek their own way out of life and assist the state in solving the employment problem. The waiting mentality of simply relying on the government is wrong. At the same time, it should be made clear to them that under the socialist system, there are only different divisions of labor, all kinds of labor are glorious, and they are all respected, and there is no distinction between high and low. The construction undertakings of our country are multifaceted, and the employment conditions of each person are different, so the avenues for employment should also be opened up from various aspects. Some people can be employed in the city, some people need to be employed in other places, some people want to be workers, some people want to be farmers, and some people want to engage in cultural, educational, and health work. Only talking about individualism and not talking about collectivism is not in line with the citizen's morality of a socialist country.
    It can be seen from the materials from various localities that some of the people who are currently registered with the labor departments to seek employment are not actually unemployed people. One type of person has no employment conditions at all; one type has already found a job, but wants to change jobs because they are not satisfied with their current job. According to a survey in Shanghai in December last year, among the registered unemployed, those who are now small vendors, temporary workers, and engaged in major housework accounted for more than 50%, and those who are physically disabled and elderly and weak and have lost their ability to work accounted for 16.9%, and those with employment conditions accounted for only a little more than 30%. The number of unemployed families is even smaller. The situation in other cities is similar. Due to the lack of thoroughness in the registration of unemployed people, a false impression of excessive unemployed population has been created. Therefore, it is very necessary for various localities to conduct a clean-up of the registered unemployed. For people who have no ability to work and have no source of income, it is not a matter of employment, but they should be provided with relief by the local civil affairs departments, as in the past. For people who already have a job, they should be educated to work with peace of mind and not change jobs. For women who are engaged in major housework, they should be mobilized to take good care of their housework and raise their children well, so that their relatives can work with peace of mind. Only people who have the conditions to work and have no job can be considered truly unemployed. As for individual people who have no job in the whole family, the labor department should give appropriate consideration under the same conditions when introducing employment.
    In January this year, after the State Council instructed that all enterprises and institutions shall not recruit personnel privately without the approval of the competent authorities, some units still recruited people from rural areas privately. According to inspections in Anhui, Nanjing, Shandong, and Beijing, more than 5,000 farmers were recruited in the first quarter of this year alone. Some units also tried every means to go through the procedures for transferring the household registration of farmers who blindly flowed into the cities, fraudulently collected food stamps, or obstructed the return of farmers to their hometowns. This behavior not only caused the blind flow of farmers and affected the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, but also affected the resettlement of unemployed and jobless people in the cities. This practice is contrary to the spirit of mobilizing unemployed and jobless people in the cities to participate in agricultural production. This kind of unorganized and undisciplined behavior that only cares about oneself and does not care about the overall situation should be corrected immediately. Rural cadres in various places, especially cadres of agricultural production cooperatives, should also cooperate with the government to educate the peasants and advise them to work with peace of mind and not blindly flow into the cities, so as to avoid futile trips back and forth.
    In short, although enterprises and institutions generally stopped recruiting workers this year, most of the unemployed and jobless people can find suitable jobs as long as they actively seek employment opportunities according to their respective conditions. The contradiction between the supply of labor exceeding the demand will gradually narrow with the development of the national economic and cultural undertakings. In the future, various enterprises and institutions will still recruit a part of the personnel in a planned way according to their needs. In our country, the problem of labor employment will surely be completely and thoroughly solved. We should be full of confidence in this.

    劳动就业的门路是广阔的
    本报评论员
    目前，在社会上还有一部分失业和无业的人要求就业。国家能不能满足他们的要求？有那些就业门路？这是大家都关心的问题。
    我们的党和国家，对劳动就业问题一贯是十分重视的。全国解放初期，社会上大约有三百万失业者。国民党反动统治机构的几百万人员也面临失业危险。党和国家对于国民党机构遗留下的旧人员采取了“包下来”的政策，使他们免于失业。随着国民经济的恢复和发展以及社会主义改造的基本完成，我国职工人数已经从解放初期的大约八百万人增加到1956年的二千四百多万人。其中经过劳动部门介绍就业的失业人员和新成长的青年就有四百万以上。旧社会遗留下来的失业人员已经基本上得到了安置。劳动就业的人数和增加的速度在我国历史上是空前的，在世界各国也是少有的。这种成就充分说明了社会主义制度的优越性，任何对劳动就业抱悲观、怀疑的态度是没有根据的。
    但是，这绝不是说目前在劳动就业方面已经毫无问题了。劳动就业在我国仍然是一个长期的、需要国家全力解决的重大问题之一。这是因为，第一，我国原有经济基础十分落后，目前生产水平还不高，因此企业、事业单位吸收人员的容量受到一定的限制。第二，我国是六亿多人口的大国，人口自然增长率很高。据估计，仅中等以上城市每年进入就业年龄的青年就有一百万人左右。第三，社会上原来还剩下一部分失业无业人员。这样，每年要求就业的人数，就超过了可能就业的职工人数。由此可见，要想在最短时间内由国家安置全部要求就业的人，显然是不可能的。要求把所有失业无业人员都安置在城市和工矿区，当然就更加办不到了。
    城市中的失业和无业人员应该从多方面寻找就业的门路。今后解决劳动就业的主要途径是参加农业生产。家在农村的，可以回家参加农业生产；家在城市的高小和中学毕业生，也可以到农村去当有文化的农民。最近各地动员部分学生参加农业生产合作社，普遍受到农民的欢迎。手工业和服务性行业，也是劳动就业的一个重要的辅助方面。此外，如街道托儿站、文化技术补习班等等，都是很好的就业途径。
    劳动就业的门路是广阔的。但是，目前有一部分失业和无业人员有单纯依赖政府和要求过高的倾向。他们要求只在本市不去外地；只愿做固定工作，不愿做临时工作；只愿从事脑力劳动，不愿从事体力劳动；只愿做轻活，不愿做重活；只愿做干净活，不愿做脏活；只愿做待遇高的工作，不愿做待遇较低的工作。有的人百般挑剔，长期无法分配他的工作。北京市有人甚至被分配过十三次之多，仍不接受工作。显然这种情况是从多方面解决劳动就业问题的重大障碍。各地劳动部门应该向这些人解释清楚。各地的报刊和热心的社会人士，也应该协助政府做好这件工作。要对这些人讲：每一个公民都应该享受劳动的权利，政府也有责任安置失业无业人员就业，谋得生活出路。但是，每一个失业无业人员更有责任接受政府的分配，同时积极自谋生活出路，协助国家解决就业问题。那种单纯依赖政府的等待思想是错误的。同时应该对他们讲清楚：在社会主义制度下，只有分工的不同，各种劳动都是光荣的，都受到尊重，没有高低贵贱的区别。我们国家的建设事业是多方面的，各人就业条件又各不相同，因此，就业的途径也应该从多方面去开辟。有些人可以在本市就业，有些人需要到外地就业，有些人要作工人，有些人要作农民，有些人要从事文教卫生工作。只讲个人主义不讲集体主义，是同社会主义国家的公民品德不相符的。
    从各地的材料中看出，目前向劳动部门登记要求就业的，有一部分实际上并不是失业人员。其中一种人是根本没有就业条件的；一种是已经找到了职业的人，因为不满意现有职业要求改行。据上海市去年12月的调查，已登记的失业人员中，现在是小商小贩、临时工和从事主要家务劳动的占50％以上，身体残废和年老体弱已经丧失劳动能力的占16. 9％，有就业条件的仅占30％多一点。其中全家失业的为数更少。其他城市情况也与此类似。由于失业人员登记不够切实，便造成了失业人口过多的假象。因此，各地对失业登记人员作一次清理是十分必要的。对于没有劳动能力而又无生活来源的人，不是就业问题，而是应该和过去一样，由当地民政部门进行救济。对于已经有了职业的人，应该教育他们安心生产，不要改行。对于从事主要家务劳动的妇女，应该动员她们管好家务，教养好子女，使自己的亲人安心工作。只有具有劳动条件又无职业的人，才能够算做真正的失业人员。至于个别的全家都没有职业的人，劳动部门在介绍就业的时候，则应当在同样的条件下给以适当照顾。
    今年1月间，国务院指示一切企业、事业单位不经主管部门批准不得私自招收人员之后，还有一些单位私自到农村乱招人。据安徽、南京、山东和北京等地检查，仅今年第一季度就招收了五千多个农民。还有的单位多方设法为盲目流入城市的农民办理转移户口手续，冒领粮票，或阻碍农民还乡。这种行为，不仅引起农民盲目流动，影响农业生产合作社的巩固，而且也影响城市失业无业人员的安置。这种作法同动员城市失业无业人员参加农业生产的精神，是背道而驰的。这种只顾自己，不顾全局的无组织无纪律的行为，应该立即纠正。各个地方的农村干部，特别是农业生产合作社的干部，也应当配合政府，向农民进行教育，劝他们安心生产，不要盲目流入城市，以免徒劳往返。
    总之，虽然今年企业、事业单位一般停止招收工人，但是失业无业的人只要根据各自的条件积极寻找就业门路，大多数是可以找到适当职业的。劳动力供过于求的矛盾，将随着国家经济文化事业的发展而逐渐缩小。今后各企业事业单位仍会按着需要有计划地招收一部分人员。在我们的国家里，劳动就业问题一定能得到完满的彻底的解决。对于这一点，应当充满信心。
