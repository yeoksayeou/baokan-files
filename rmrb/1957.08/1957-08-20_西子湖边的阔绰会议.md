    A Lavish Meeting by West Lake
    The Zhejiang Office of the East China Geological Bureau, entrusted by the Southern General Bureau of the Ministry of Geology, prepared for the Southern Seven Provinces 1957 General Survey Work Conference held by the General Bureau in Hangzhou. The office spent considerable effort finding a first-class hotel – the Jincheng Hotel – for the conference delegates to stay in.
    Unfortunately, some responsible persons, led by Director Wang of the Southern General Bureau, expressed great dissatisfaction with the preparations after arriving in Hangzhou. Presumably because this hotel lacked comfortable high-end facilities and the environment wasn't elegant enough, Director Wang personally took charge and rented all the rooms at the Xiling Hotel and part of the Hangzhou Hotel, which is specially used to receive foreign guests.
    This conference dragged on for ten days. The hotel accommodation alone cost about 3,500 yuan. In addition, the original closing date of the conference was suddenly postponed, and the collective train tickets that had been purchased had to be returned, resulting in a waste of a considerable amount of refund fees.
    Hangzhou is not the center of the Southern Seven Provinces, so why was it necessary to hold such a working conference here? Could it be that the scenery of West Lake can help solve some problems in the general survey work?
    In its instructions on launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, the Ministry of Geology emphasized that meetings were not allowed to rent high-end hotels or provide entertainment such as watching operas and sightseeing. The Southern General Bureau itself also made similar regulations. Why did the Southern General Bureau insist on not implementing the instructions from higher authorities and the regulations it made itself?

### 西子湖边的阔绰会议

    西子湖边的阔绰会议
    华东地质局浙江办事处受地质部南方总局嘱托，为总局在杭州召开的南方七省1957年普查工作会议作准备工作。办事处花了不少力量，找到了一家甲级饭店——金城饭店，供会议代表住宿用。
    不幸得很，以南方总局王局长为首的一些负责人到达杭州以后，对这儿的准备工作表示很不称心。大概是因为这家饭店没有舒适的高级设备，环境不算幽雅吧，王局长又亲自出马，租用了西泠饭店的全部房间和专门招待外宾的杭州饭店的一部分房间。
    这次会议，拖拖沓沓开了十天。仅住旅馆一项，就花了约三千五百元。加以会议原定闭幕日期突然延期，买好了的集体火车票不得不退掉，结果又白白地浪费了不少退票费。
    杭州并非南方七省的中心，为什么这样的工作会议一定要在这儿开呢？莫非西子湖的湖光山色，能帮助解决一些普查工作中的问题吗？
    地质部在关于展开增产节约运动的指示中，曾经强调开会不准租用高级旅馆，不准招待看戏和游览，南方总局自己也作过类似的规定。上级的指示，自己作出的规定，南方总局为什么偏偏不执行呢？
