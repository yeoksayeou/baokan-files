    People eat pig food, pigs eat people food!
　　——This is not uncommon in capitalist society

    Left picture: Working people in capitalist society have difficulty making a living and are never full. Like this unemployed worker in Hamburg, West Germany, he has to search for food in the trash can to fill his stomach. But the result of the search is often disappointing and fruitless.

    Right picture: The exploiting class in capitalist society leads a life of debauchery and extravagance. Sometimes, when they are bored, they even feed small animals with things that people eat or that ordinary working people cannot afford, in order to amuse themselves. Look at the picture of this wealthy and idle person in West Germany feeding his "respected" fat pig with sausage, patiently forking it piece by piece, and even putting a napkin on this little animal as if it were a person!

    人吃猪食，猪吃人食！
　　——在资本主义社会里，这事并不稀奇
    左图：资本主义社会的劳动人民谋生困难，终日不得一饱。像这个西德汉堡的失业工人，为了填肚皮不得不在垃圾箱内找东西吃。但寻食的结果，常常是失望，一无所得。
    右图：资本主义社会的剥削阶级，过着荒淫豪奢的生活。有时，他们闲得发慌，还要用人们吃的或者一般劳动人民吃不到的物品，喂养小畜牲以自取乐。请看图中的这个西德的有钱有闲的人在用香肠喂他“可敬”的肥猪，用叉子一块块耐心地叉给它吃，而且像对人一样还给这小畜牲带上了餐巾呢！
