Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 2nd. The entire faculty and staff of the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts have been holding anti-rightist struggle meetings for days, exposing the anti-Party clique in the art world headed by Jiang Feng.

This clique was formed as early as 1951 when Jiang Feng was in Hangzhou. Its members include Pang Xunqin, Vice President of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, Mo Pu, Vice President of the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and associate professors Jin Lang and Jin Ye. They habitually used the tactic of mutual flattery and mutual praise to elevate Jiang Feng's "prestige." Jin Lang once said: "Among the artists within the Party, no one is convinced by anyone else except Jiang Feng. The art cause cannot be led without Jiang Feng." On August 1, 1951, when Jiang Feng was transferred to Beijing, Pang Xunqin, Jin Ye, and others, under false pretenses, mobilized teachers, students, and staff to see him off. When Jiang Feng boarded the train, Pang and Jin even raised their arms and shouted "Long live Jiang Feng!"

These rightist elements have always arrogantly resisted the leadership of the Communist Party. When the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China came to the East China Branch to inspect work this spring and discovered that the college had made mistakes in implementing the Party's policy toward intellectuals in the early days of liberation, it reported this to the Central Committee. After the Central Committee issued a circular, Jiang Feng copied the original text of the circular to Jin Lang, falsely claiming that the report did not conform to the facts and saying that the Provincial Committee was biased and instructed Jin Lang to raise objections to the Provincial Committee and the Central Committee.

In the anti-rightist struggle, when Jiang Feng's anti-Party remarks and actions were exposed, Jin Lang tried to shift the blame to the Party, saying, "This cannot be blamed on Jiang Feng. What power does Jiang Feng have personally? If we investigate, isn't it Zhou Yang and the Central Committee's mistake!"

The rightist element Mo Pu, who is still staying in Beijing, wrote to Jin Lang on May 27, saying: "Those comrades in Beijing who have conscience and are truly working hard for the proletarian art cause, in order to oppose Qian Junrui and Cai Ruohong, in order to expose the subjectivism of the Ministry of Culture and the Artists Association, and the vile behavior of blaming Jiang Feng for the issue of traditional Chinese painting, ...everyone spoke excitedly. They expressed angry protests against the People's Daily's attack on Jiang Feng." The letter concluded by saying: "We are not isolated...Jiang Feng and I will still return, although it will be a bitter struggle, we must continue to fight!"

Jiang Feng, Jin Lang, Jin Ye, and others are very hostile to the Party and to the past political movements. They slander the collective leadership of the Communist Party as patriarchal leadership, saying that "the Party itself is a wall," and even compared the Party and its leaders to "Yan Song," scolding Communist Party members as "politically rigid." Jin Lang said: "Politics is dogma, politics strangles art, and those who engage in art are persecuted to death by politics." Jin Ye also said: "The suppression of counter-revolutionaries was full of murderous intent," and "Activists are those who rose to prominence by suppressing counter-revolutionaries, they are opportunists, they are flatterers." After the Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," Jin Ye maliciously spread rumors saying: "This policy is completely consistent with the anti-Party opinions of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique." During the period of great blooming and great contending, Jin Lang, as a Communist Party member, said: "The Party used to persecute people, now it is being persecuted by others!" "The Party's reputation is utterly ruined!" He also said: "To be honest, there is no democracy within the Party, I am dissatisfied with the Party!"

Through days of exposure, the ugly faces of the members of this anti-Party clique in the art world have been completely exposed.

    他们高呼“江丰万岁”他们辱骂党是“严嵩”
    美术界反党小集团面目狰狞
    据新华社杭州2日电　中央美术学院华东分院全体教职员工，连日来举行反右派斗争大会，揭露以江丰为首的美术界反党小集团。
    这个小集团早于1951年，江丰在杭州时就已经形成，它的成员有中央工艺美术学院副院长庞熏琴，中央美术学院华东分院副院长莫朴，副教授金浪、金冶等人。他们惯用相互吹捧、相互标榜的手法来抬高江丰的“威信”。金浪曾说：“党内的美术家中，除江丰外，都互不服气，美术事业非江丰领导不可”。1951年8月1日，当江丰调往北京时，庞熏琴、金冶等人假借名义，动员师生员工欢送。江丰登车时，庞、金两人竟振臂高呼“江丰万岁！”
    这些右派分子一贯狂妄地抗拒共产党的领导。当今年春天中共浙江省委到华东分院检查工作，发现该院解放初期在执行党对知识分子的政策上有错误，就报告中央。中央发了通报后，江丰就将通报原文抄给金浪，诬指报告不符事实，说省委偏听偏信，指示金浪向省委和中央提出反对。
    在反右派斗争中，当江丰反党言行被揭露后，金浪就为他设法嫁祸于党，说“这不能怪江丰，江丰个人有什么权力？追究起来还不是周扬和中央的错误！”
    现在还逗留在北京的右派分子莫朴在5月27日写信给金浪说：“在北京的有良心的真正为无产阶级美术事业努力的同志们，为了反对钱俊瑞、蔡若虹，为了揭露文化部、美协的主观主义和把国画问题嫁祸于江丰的恶劣行为，……大家都激动地发了言。对人民日报发表对江丰的攻击，表示愤怒的抗议。”信的最后还说：“我们不是孤立的，……我和江丰还是要回来的，虽然是苦斗，然而我们必需斗下去！”
    江丰、金浪、金冶等非常仇视党，仇视历次的政治运动。他们污蔑共产党的集体领导为家长式领导，说“党本身就是墙”，甚至把党和领导者比作“严嵩”，骂共产党员“政治僵化”。金浪说：“政治是教条，政治扼杀艺术，搞艺术的人被政治整死了。”金冶还说：“肃反搞得杀气腾腾”，“积极分子是靠肃反起家，是投机分子，是拍马屁”。党提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针后，金冶竟恶意地散布流言说：“这个方针是和胡风反革命分子的反党意见书完全一致的。”在大放大鸣期间，身为共产党员的金浪却说：“党过去整人，现在给别人整了！”“党的臭名满天下了！”，他又说：“老实说，党内是不民主的，我对党是不满的！”
    经过连日来的揭发，这批美术界的反党小集团的成员的丑恶嘴脸已经完全暴露了。
