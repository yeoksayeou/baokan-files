Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th. "Such and such industry is on its last legs," or "Such and such factory or store has gone bankrupt and closed down," is no longer news in recent Taiwanese newspapers. This desolate scene pervades all industries and businesses, large and small, in Taiwan's industrial and commercial circles.

A Taiwanese newspaper lamented: "It's not that we are exaggerating, but at least 50% of today's industrial and commercial circles are facing the possibility of a crisis at any time."

American control over Taiwan's industrial raw materials, the massive dumping of American products into Taiwan, coupled with the Chiang Kai-shek clique's heavy tax extortion, have brought many of Taiwan's private industries to the brink of collapse. Taiwan's flour industry, whose entire raw material supply is controlled by the United States, is currently facing a serious threat of having no raw materials. This year, all flour factories in Taiwan received only over 180,000 tons of "US Aid" wheat, only about half of their raw material needs, so many flour factories will be unable to survive. The private pharmaceutical industry, flashlight industry, and electrical materials industry are also facing serious crises. Taiwanese newspapers describe the current situation of the private flashlight industry as "on its last legs"; the private electrical materials industry "has always been tossed about in the bleak wind and rain, with no improvement whatsoever," and many electrical materials factories have been forced to stop production. All flashlight factories are "hovering on the edge of death."

The commercial market in Taiwan is currently experiencing a general slump and closures. June and July were originally the peak season for the Taiwan cotton cloth market, but in Taipei, the city with the largest cotton cloth sales volume, the transaction situation from the beginning of this year to now is less than two-thirds of the transaction volume in the same period last year. The recent downturn in the timber market is even "unprecedented." In the midst of the slump, many stores have no choice but to sell at a loss in order to attract customers, resulting in unprecedented fierce competition in the market. In the Taipei market, competitive scenes such as "free giveaways" and "free samples" of milk powder have recently appeared. In the struggle for the market, agents of American and other countries' commodities, with their strong capital, take the opportunity to squeeze out and attack Taiwan's private commerce. Many stores have collapsed because they cannot withstand the fierce competition. Currently, many stores that have not closed down are relying on high-interest loans to maintain their facade.

The devastation of Taiwan's private industry and commerce by the US and Chiang is not only threatening the largest number of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises, but also some large-scale private enterprises are not spared. The paper and forestry companies, two of the so-called four major private companies in Taiwan, are currently on the verge of collapse. Nearly ten paper companies of considerable scale have declared bankruptcy. Lian Sheng Trading Company, a usually "prosperous" store in Taipei, also quietly closed down in mid-July because it could not hold on, owing more than ten million Taiwan dollars. One company with assets of 300 million Taiwan dollars now owes as much as 110 million Taiwan dollars in bank and "US Aid" loans, and the so-called "US Aid" principal and interest to be repaid each year amounts to 16 million. The agricultural and forestry company, due to almost the same reasons as the paper company, became a mess as early as last year.

### 不堪美蒋双重摧残  台湾民营工业奄奄一息

    不堪美蒋双重摧残
    台湾民营工业奄奄一息
    据新华社广州7日电　“某某行业奄奄一息”或“某某厂店破产倒闭”，这在最近的台湾报纸上已不成为什么新闻。这种雕零景象遍及到台湾工商界的各行各业和大小企业。
    一家台湾报纸感慨地说：“不是我们说危言耸听的话，今日的工商业界，至少有50％以上，随时都有危机爆发的可能。
    美国对台湾工业原料的控制，大量美国产品向台湾倾销，加上蒋介石集团的重税压榨，使台湾的许多民营工业面临崩溃的边缘。全部原料受到美国控制的台湾面粉工业，目前已面临没有原料的严重威胁。今年台湾所有面粉工厂得到配售的“美援”小麦仅十八万多吨，只达到它们原料需要量的一半左右，因而许多面粉工厂就要无法立足了。民营的制药工业、电筒工业和电料工业等工业行业，目前也面临着严重的危机。台湾报纸形容民营的电筒工业目前的处境是“奄奄一息”；民营的电料工业则“始终在凄风苦雨中转来转去，丝毫没有起色”，许多电料工厂已被迫停止生产。各电筒工厂则“徘徊在死亡的边缘”。
    台湾的商业市场上，目前出现着一片淡风和倒风。6月和7月原是台湾棉布市场的旺季，可是，在棉布销售量最大的台北市，今年开春到现在的交易情形，还不到去年同期交易额的三分之二。木材市场最近的不景气，更是“空前未有的”。许多商店在淡风之中，为了招徕顾客，只有不顾血本，削价求售，形成市场上前所未有的剧烈竞争。在台北市场上，最近就出现了像“免费赠送”与“免费试饮”奶粉这类的竞争场面。在争夺市场的斗争中，美国和其它国家商品的代理商、挟着雄厚的资本，乘机来排挤打击台湾的民营商业。许多商店就因为在剧烈的竞争中无法支撑而垮台。目前许多没有倒闭的商店，都是靠借高利贷来维持门面。
    美蒋对台湾民营工商业的摧残，不仅使最大量的中小工商业受着威胁，而且一部分大规模的民营企业也不能幸免。所谓台湾四大民营公司中的纸业和农林两家公司，目前都已面临崩溃的边缘。纸业公司就有将近十家相当规模的商行宣告倒闭。台北一家平日“生意兴隆”的连盛贸易行，7月中也支持不了而悄悄关门，负债达到台币一千多万。拥有资产三亿元台币的一家公司，现在欠下的银行和“美援”借款，已多达一亿一千多万元，每年要偿还的所谓“美援”本息，即达一千六百万。农林公司也由于差不多是同纸业公司一样的原因，早在去年就变成了一个烂摊子。
