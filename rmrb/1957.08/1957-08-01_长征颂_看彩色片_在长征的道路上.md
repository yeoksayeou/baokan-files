Ode to the Long March
——Watching the Color Film "On the Road of the Long March"
Chen Zongfeng

History will not repeat itself, and time will never return; but the heroic deeds of the Red Army in the Long March will forever remain in people's hearts, passed down through generations, shining as brightly as the sun and moon. The places the Red Army heroes marched through will also forever proudly radiate light. Thousands of years from now, people will still remember them, cherish them, and sing their praises.

This glorious remembrance and heroic hymn will be presented to millions of people in the five-color documentary "On the Road of the Long March," and will deeply stir the strings of people's hearts. "On the Road of the Long March" does not stiffly and statically depict the scenery, nor is it a silent still life; this film makes people feel as if they are traveling on the road of the Long March, sharing the breath of the heroes of that time, arousing people's saturated fighting spirit, making people feel as if they are personally present in those places, advancing together with the Red Army heroes of that year. From Jinggangshan to Ruijin, from Wujiang to Zunyi, from the Greater and Lesser Liangshan Mountains across the Dadu River to the Blackwater Grasslands, from Lazikou over Liupan Mountain to Yan'an, connected in a line, with distinct chapters. Although you cannot see the heroic figures of that time, it still makes you excited.

This is truly a living history with sound, color, emotion, and scenery!

The motherland has countless beautiful and majestic rivers and mountains, and countless people have walked through them and praised them; however, when you see Jinggangshan, you will not only linger on its landscape, but you will naturally think that here, the Party created the Chinese people's own army. This place is the cradle of today's victory, this place makes imperialism pale, and feudal bureaucratic landlords fall into decline. It is the first holy land of the Chinese people! When you see this and think of this, how can you not feel a sense of respect!

Following the Long March roads displayed on the film, moving on, and on, past the Wujiang River, to Zunyi.

Zunyi! Previously barren and miserable, people were so exploited that they could not even afford a pair of pants; but in this very place, Chairman Mao reversed the situation, not only turning Zunyi into a county town with sunny days every day, but also making the Chinese revolution go straight to victory today from a winding road.

Here, it is not difficult for you to recall the situation of that year: Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, with their millions of demoralized soldiers, bombing from the sky and following on the ground, and our Party also had serious dogmatism; at that time, it was really like "a leaky house being hit by continuous rain, and a dangerous boat encountering a headwind," the Chinese revolution was in a double attack from inside and outside. But our wise helmsman and great leader led us through numerous dangerous shoals and shattered the enemy's encirclement. Today, in Zunyi, red flags are flying on the city walls, and pedestrians are shuttling back and forth. Zunyi is a witness to history.

During the days when the Red Army crossed the snowy mountains, snow covered the mountain peaks, and snow blocked the road, but the snow could not block the heroes' hearts for progress. The road is made by people walking on it. If you slip and fall, you stand up yourself. The grasslands were muddy everywhere, and there was a risk of sinking when you stepped down. These hardships and difficulties are difficult for people who are used to walking on flat ground today to imagine. When we look at the road the Red Army walked in those years, when we remember the heroic feats of the heroes, how can we better spur and encourage ourselves?

The red flag flies over Liupan Mountain, the red flag flies to Yan'an! The red flag, high and flying in Tiananmen Square, this is the fruit borne by the "seeding machine"; this is the achievement of the Red Army soldiers whose spirit shook the mountains and rivers!

Thanks to the filmmakers, "On the Road of the Long March" is a poetic ode to the Red Army heroes, and it gives us a vivid lesson!

    长征颂
    ——看彩色片“在长征的道路上”
    陈宗凤
    历史是不会重演了，时间也是一去不复返了；但长征的红军英雄们的丰功伟业，将长存在人们的心里，传之万代，与日月争光。红军英雄们所走过的地方，也将永远骄傲地闪射着光芒。千万年后，人们还会记起他们，怀念他们，并且歌颂他们。
    这光荣的怀念和这英雄的赞歌，将在“在长征的道路上”这部五彩纪录片中呈现在千万人民眼前，并且将深深地激动人们的心弦。“在长征的道路上”这影片不是呆板停滞地表现水光山色，不是沉寂不动的静物写生；这片子使人们宛如旅行在长征的路上，与当时的英雄呼吸相共，激起人们饱和的斗志，使人们也好像亲临那些地方，跟着当年的红军英雄们一同前进。从井岗山到瑞金，从乌江到遵义，从大小凉山过大渡河到黑水草地，从腊子口过六盘山直到延安，一线相连，章节分明。虽然你看不见当时的英雄人物，但仍然令你激动。
    这真是一页有声有色有情有景的活历史！
    祖国有无数秀丽、雄伟的河山，也不知有多少人走过，多少人歌颂过；然而当你看到井岗山的时候，就不光是留恋于它的山光水色，你会很自然地想起，在这里，党创建了中国人民自己的军队。这地方是今天胜利的摇篮，这地方使帝国主义失色，使封建官僚地主落魄，它是中国人民第一块圣洁的大地！你看到这里，你想到这里，怎不油然生敬哩！
    随着影片上显现的长征的道路，走过去，再走过去，走过乌江，到了遵义。
    遵义！先前荒凉凄苦，人们被压榨得穿不上一条裤子；然而就在这个地方，毛主席扭转过乾坤，不仅使遵义这个县城变成天天太阳日日晴，而且使中国革命从弯曲的道路上直通到胜利的今天。
    这里你就不难想起当年的景况：蒋介石匪徒们那百万残兵，天上炸，地上跟，而我们党内又有着严重的教条主义，那个时候真好像“屋漏又遭连夜雨，船危复遇打头风”，中国革命在内外夹攻中。但我们英明的舵手和伟大的领袖使我们渡过重重险滩，粉碎了敌人的围攻。而今，遵义这地方，城头飞舞着红旗，城头穿梭的行人来来往往。遵义是历史的见证人。
  红军走过雪山的日子，雪封满山顶，雪封闭了路，但是雪封不了英雄们前进的心。路是人走出来的，滑倒了自己站起来；草地上到处泥泞，下脚就有陷下去的危险。这些艰难困苦，今天走惯了平地的人，是很难想像得到的。当我们看看当年红军走过的路，当我们缅怀英雄们的丰功伟绩，我们将如何更好地鞭策和激励自己呢？
    红旗飞过六盘山，红旗飞向延安！红旗啊，高高的飞扬在天安门上，这就是“播种机”结的果实；这就是气壮山河的红军战士的建树！
    感谢影片的摄制者们，“在长征的道路上”是一首对红军英雄们的饱含诗意的颂歌，它给我们上了生动的一课！
