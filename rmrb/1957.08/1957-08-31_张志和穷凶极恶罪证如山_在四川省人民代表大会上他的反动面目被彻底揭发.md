Xinhua News Agency report: Zhang Zhihe, a key member of the Zhang-Luo Alliance – State Council Counselor and member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League – had his reactionary face fully exposed at the ongoing Fifth Session of the First Sichuan Provincial People's Congress. Faced with the irrefutable facts revealed by the representatives, Zhang Zhihe has been forced to begin to bow his head and confess his crimes.

According to representatives, on May 23rd of this year, during a symposium at the Beijing Socialist Academy, Zhang Zhihe openly "defended" a local tyrant and gangster boss in Sichuan, saying that this gangster boss had "contributed to the revolution" and "should not have been sentenced." He attempted to implement Luo Longji's "rehabilitation" proposal through this matter. On June 6th, Zhang Zhihe again openly attacked the Communist Party's cadre policy at the 10th branch meeting of the China Democratic League Central Committee, slandering the Communist Party for "burying good people and promoting bad people." After the People's Daily editorial "Why Is This?" was published on June 8th, Zhang Zhihe, Fan Puzhai, and Tan Tiwu discussed countermeasures, believing that this editorial "had greatly lost popular support." They advocated continuing to attack the Communist Party. Zhang Zhihe also blamed Tan Tiwu for not being ruthless enough in his attacks on Lu Yuwen, demanding further action. Zhang Zhihe not only ignited fires in Beijing but also directly commanded his cronies to ignite fires in units such as the Sichuan Institute of Finance and Economics, the Provincial Department of Transportation, and the Provincial People's Hospital. He directed his cronies to use an "internal and external pincer attack" to attempt to crush the progressive forces within the provincial and municipal committees of the China Democratic League.

Although the representatives revealed many facts at the meeting, Zhang Zhihe denied everything, claiming that he had always been "progressive." Many representatives used facts to refute this facade. According to reports, Zhang Zhihe infiltrated the Communist Party during the climax of the First Great Revolution, but even then, he actively wrote the reactionary program and manifesto of "Pan-Nationalism" (i.e., National Statism). In 1930, he served as an officer under a local warlord. On September 3rd of the same year, the Jiangjin local troops, under the leadership of the Communist Party, launched an uprising. Zhang Zhihe betrayed the Party at that time and cruelly suppressed this uprising, which led to his expulsion from the Party. After this incident, Zhang Zhihe personally participated in interrogations and executed more than sixty uprising soldiers and Communist Party members on the spot. He also branded the characters "Communist Bandit" on many soldiers' bodies. He cruelly poked three holes in the head of a Red Army soldier, inserted two candles and an incense stick, and "sacrificed" him alive to his reactionary adjutant. He also shamelessly stripped the clothes off a wounded and captured female Communist Party member, Cao Zezhi, and personally used a lamp to illuminate Cao Zezhi's entire body to see if there were any marks under the female Communist Party member's breasts. This female Communist Party member became disabled after his insults and severe torture. At the group meeting of this provincial People's Congress, this former female Communist Party member came to the meeting to confront Zhang Zhihe, forcing Zhang Zhihe to admit his bloody crimes.

According to reports, Zhang Zhihe infiltrated the China Democratic League in 1942, but at the same time, he colluded with reactionary leaders Zhang Qun, Wang Lingji, and the big secret agents Xu Yuanju and Xu Zhongqi. In November of the same year, Zhang Zhihe betrayed the China Democratic League again. Under the instructions of Kuomintang secret agents, he and Fan Puzhai jointly published a notice in the newspaper disbanding the Sichuan Provincial and Chengdu Municipal China Democratic League organizations. Subsequently, Zhang Zhihe openly defected to Wang Lingji and served as the "senior advisor" of the puppet Sichuan Provincial Government.

According to reports, after 1948, Zhang Zhihe actively implemented Zhang Bojun's reactionary political line, collected political capital everywhere, conspired to divide Sichuan and Xikang, and organized reactionary armed forces. Out of the one hundred and forty-five so-called "league members" he developed in Ya'an, Yingjing, and Tianquan in 1948 and 1949, thirty-three were local tyrants and habitual bandits, twenty-six were puppet military officers, and two were secret agents. The bandit leader Zhu Shizheng was the commander-in-chief of this reactionary force. At that time, Zhang Zhihe also put forward the slogan of "First, Big, Obvious." The so-called "First" meant to rob the People's Liberation Army of the "first" opportunity; "Big" meant to continue to expand the landlord-bandit armed forces; "Obvious" meant to show his strength to the Communist Party and the people.

After liberation, Zhang Zhihe's conspiracy to divide Sichuan and Xikang failed, and the China Democratic League organization underwent rectification. Zhang Zhihe, Fan Puzhai, and others, with the support of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, directly directed the rightist elements in Sichuan, Zhang Songtao, Han Wenmu, Liu Kunnan, and others, to try every means to overturn the case of armed division and overturn the case of organization rectification. After the start of the anti-Rightist struggle, Zhang Zhihe continued to collude with Fan Puzhai and Pan Dakui, attempting to cover up their crimes.

　　张志和穷凶极恶罪证如山
    在四川省人民代表大会上他的反动面目被彻底揭发
    新华社讯　章罗联盟的骨干分子——国务院参事、民盟中央委员张志和的反动面目，已经在正在举行的四川省第一届人民代表大会第五次会议上被充分揭露出来。张志和在代表们所揭露的铁的事实面前，不得不开始低头认罪。
    据代表们揭露，今年5月23日，张志和在北京社会主义学院的一次座谈会上，公然为四川一个土匪恶霸头子“伸冤”，说这个土匪恶霸头子“对革命有贡献”，“不该判刑”。他企图以这件事贯彻罗隆基“平反”的主张。6月6日，张志和又在民盟中央第十支部会上公开攻击共产党的干部政策，污蔑共产党“埋没了好人，提拔了坏人”，6月8日人民日报社论“这是为什么”发表后，张志和、范朴斋和谭惕吾一起研究对策，认为这篇社论“大失人心”，他们主张继续向共产党进攻。张志和还责怪谭惕吾对卢郁文的打击还不够凶狠，需要更进一步。张志和不仅在北京点火，同时，还直接指挥他的亲信在四川财经学院、省交通厅、省人民医院等单位点火，并指挥他的亲信以“内外夹攻”的方式，企图打垮民盟省市委机关中的进步力量。
    虽然代表们在会上揭露了许多事实，但张志和却在会上抵赖，说他过去一直是“进步”的。许多代表就用事实来驳他这一层画皮。据揭露，张志和在第一次国内大革命高潮时期曾经混入共产党，但就在那时候，他却积极地写作“全民主义”（即国家主义）的反动政纲和宣言。1930年，他在地方军阀手下当军官。同年9月3日，江津地方部队在共产党领导下起义，张志和当时就叛变了党，残酷地镇压这次起义，因而被清洗出党。这次事件发生后，张志和亲自参加审问并当场枪杀起义士兵和共产党员六十多人。他还在很多士兵的身上刻上“共匪”二字。他残酷地在一个红军战士的头上打了三个眼，插上两支蜡烛和一柱香，“活祭”他那反动透顶的副官长。他还无耻地把一个受伤后被俘的女共产党员曹泽芝的衣服剥光，亲自用灯照曹泽芝的全身，看这位女共产党员的乳下有没有记号。这位女共产党员经他的百般侮辱和严刑拷打以后，成了残废。在这次省人代会小组会上，这位当年的女共产党员当场到会和张志和对质，迫使张志和不得不承认他的血腥罪行。
    据揭露，1942年张志和混入了民盟，但他同时又勾结反动派头子张群、王陵基和大特务徐远举、徐中齐等人。同年11月，张志和又叛变了民盟，根据国民党特务的指示，和范朴斋联名登报解散四川省和成都市的民盟组织。接着，张志和就公开投靠了王陵基，担任了伪四川省府的“高级顾问”。
    据揭露，1948年以后，张志和又积极贯彻章伯钧的反动政治路线，到处搜罗政治资本，阴谋割据川康，并且组织了反动武装。1948年和1949年，他在雅安、荥经、天全三地发展的一百四十五个所谓
  “盟员”中，有恶霸、惯匪三十三人，伪军官二十六人，特务二人，匪首朱世正就是这支反动队伍的总指挥。当时张志和还提出“先、大、显”的号召，所谓“先”就是要抢人民解放军的“先”；“大”就是要继续扩大地主土匪武装；“显”就是要向共产党和人民显示他的力量。
    解放以后，张志和割据川康的阴谋破产了，民盟组织又进行了整理工作。张志和、范朴斋以后就在章罗联盟的支持下，直接指挥四川的右派分子张松涛、韩文睦、刘坤南等，千方百计地图谋翻武装割据的案，翻整理组织工作的案。在反右派斗争开始后，张志和还继续同范朴斋、潘大逵勾结，企图掩盖他们的罪行。
