Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: Hachiro Arita, advisor to the Japanese Socialist Party, issued a statement to the Chinese people today. The full text is as follows:

　　To all Chinese people, Mr. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and all members, I would first like to express my heartfelt gratitude for your invitation to us to visit New China this time.

　　In Japan, I serve as an advisor to the Japanese Socialist Party, a representative member of the National Federation for the Support of the Peace Constitution, vice-chairman of the welcoming committee for the Chinese Red Cross delegation to Japan, president of the Philanthropic Cross Society, which aims to assist the disabled, and chairman of the so-called bereaved family association, which awaits the return of children who have not returned since the last war. I have been doing my best for the democratic forces and the victims of war.

　　Regarding the issue of Japanese nationals returning from China, thanks to the generosity of the Chinese people, and the enormous efforts and assistance of the Chinese People's Government, the Chinese Red Cross, and other relevant parties, approximately 30,000 people have been able to return home in the past four years. As the chairman of the bereaved family association and as a member of the Japanese people, I would first like to express my deepest gratitude.

　　In the past, Japanese militarism not only carried out a brutal war of aggression, but also forced innocent Chinese people to go to Japan to engage in arduous labor, committing many crimes against the Chinese people. In particular, many Chinese people who were captured and taken to Japan were brutally murdered by Japanese militarists. After the war, the democratic Japanese people sincerely felt remorse for this. In order to make amends for it, we hold a firm determination to never wage war again, and this determination is also expressed in the Japanese Constitution, which is based on democracy, pacifism, and respect for fundamental human rights. This is the first time I have set foot on Chinese soil since the liberation of China. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt condolences to these Chinese martyrs who died in the disaster, as a small expression of the Japanese people's remorseful feelings. The relationship between China and Japan has greatly developed since 1953, when the Chinese Red Cross and others assisted in the repatriation of Japanese nationals and when the Committee for the Consolation of Chinese War Dead sent back the remains of Chinese people. The issue of returning the remains of Chinese victims, by its nature, is a matter for the government. We have made strong demands to the government on this matter. Faced with our sincerity, the government reluctantly had to accept it in principle. The Japanese government, which is called conservative and reactionary, is also helpless in the face of the vigorously developing atmosphere of Sino-Japanese friendship.

　　There can be no world peace without Asian peace, and Asian peace will come from the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and Japan, so there is no need to be pessimistic about our future.

　　I am confident that the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan will be increasingly strengthened in the future.

### 日社会党顾问有田八郎发表声明  确信中日人民友谊将日益加强

　　日社会党顾问有田八郎发表声明
　  确信中日人民友谊将日益加强
    新华社24日讯　日本社会党顾问有田八郎今天向中国人民发表了一项声明。全文如下：
    各位中国人民、中国人民外交学会会长张奚若先生以及各位会员，首先对于你们这次邀请我们来新中国，致以衷心的感谢。
    我在日本担任日本社会党顾问、拥护和平宪法国民联合会的代表委员、中国红十字会访日代表团欢迎委员会副会长、以援助残废者为目的的友爱十字会会长、和等待从上次战争以来尚未回来的子弟的所谓遗家属团体会长等职，一直在为民主势力和战争牺牲者尽其微力。
    在华日本人回国问题，由于中国人民的宽大，由于中国人民政府和中国红十字会及其他有关方面各位的巨大努力和帮助，四年以来约有三万人得以回国。我作为遗家属团体会长又作为日本人民的一分子，首先致以深深的谢意。
    在过去日本军国主义不但进行了残酷的侵略战争，而且还强迫无辜的中国人到日本去从事繁重的劳动，对各位中国人民犯下了许多罪行。尤其，许多被抓到日本去的中国人，被日本军国主义者所惨杀。战后，有了民主的日本人民对此衷心感到歉意。为了弥补它，我们抱着坚定的决心，绝对不再进行战争，这种决心也表现在以民主主义、和平主义、尊重基本人权为支柱的日本宪法上面。我是中国解放后第一次踏上了中国领土的，趁此机会，谨向这些遇难的中国烈士致以衷心的哀悼，借以表示日本人民悔悟的心情的一端。中国和日本的关系是从1953年中国红十字会等协助日本人回国和由中国人俘虏殉难者慰灵实行委员会遣送中国人遗骨时起，有了很大的发展。遇难中国人的遗骨遣返问题，按其性质是属于政府的事情，我们曾就此向政府提出强烈的要求，在我们的热诚面前，政府方面虽很勉强但不得不在原则上予以接受。被称为保守反动的日本政府对于蓬勃发展的日中友好的气氛，也是无可奈何的。
    有了亚洲和平才有世界和平，而亚洲和平将来自中日两国人民的友好和合作，那么我们的前途是无需悲观的。
    我确信日中两国人民的友谊，今后将日益加强。
