    Our newspaper, Wuhan, 31st of August, dispatch from correspondent Yi Ding: The anti-Rightist struggle in Hubei Province has achieved its first decisive victory in the provincial and municipal (Wuhan) leading organs and universities. The struggle is now expanding to all sectors. Since the unfolding of the rectification movement, bourgeois Rightists, under the guise of helping the Party rectify its work style, launched a frenzied attack on the Party. In the Hubei and Wuhan areas, bourgeois Rightist elements such as Ma Zhemin (one of the "generals" of the Zhang-Luo alliance, Chairman of the China Democratic League's Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Committees, and President of the Central South University of Economics and Finance), Geng Bozhao (a major despotic landlord, the "local emperor" of Anlu County, Hubei Province, Standing Committee Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang's Hubei Provincial Committee, and Director of the Hubei Provincial Office of Counselors), Wang Yiming (Vice Mayor of Wuhan, Chairman of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Deputy Chairman of the Municipal Construction Committee), Wang Yijiao (Member of the Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Deputy Director of the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture), Peng Yihu (a major despotic landlord from Yueyang County, Hunan Province, Member of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, and Deputy Director of the Municipal Office of Counselors), Yan Xunfu (Chairman of the Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Vice Chairman of the Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, and Director of the Municipal Office of Counselors), Zhu Yubi (President of Hubei Medical College), Cheng Qianfan (Professor at Wuhan University), Chen Taijie (Professor at Huazhong Institute of Technology), Wei Zhuomin (Professor at Huazhong Normal College), Ke Xiangyin (Professor at Huazhong Agricultural College), Deng Jiesong (Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Xiao Zuolin (Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Deputy Director of the Municipal Construction Bureau), and Party Rightist elements such as Jiang Yun, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Hubei People's Publishing House, and others. In order to repel the frantic attacks of the Rightists, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and its affiliated Party organizations mobilized the broad masses to criticize and expose the backbone Rightist elements, uncovering a number of large and small bourgeois Rightist anti-Party cliques, including the most vicious anti-Party cliques, such as the Ma Zhemin, Dai Jinsheng, Xiang Cuian, and Chen Zhongzheng clique, which used the China Democratic League as a cover, led by Ma Zhemin; the Geng Bozhao, Gu Da'an, Hu Fu, and other seven-member clique, which used the Provincial Office of Counselors as its stronghold, led by Geng Bozhao; and the Cheng Qianfan, Wu Kaibin, and Li Zhengyu clique, which used Wuhan University as its stronghold, led by Cheng Qianfan and Wu Kaibin (a Wuhan University student with close ties to Lin Xiling). These anti-Party cliques have engaged in a series of conspiratorial sabotage activities in an organized, led, programmed, and planned manner. For example, under the planning of Ma Zhemin, the Ma Zhemin anti-Party clique not only carried out many anti-Party activities at the Central South University of Economics and Finance, but also successively appointed Lu Mingqiu, Zhang Yunmian, Wei Zhuomin, Ai Weisheng, Lu Huabai, Gao Qingci, Chen Taijie, Chen Zhongzheng, Ke Xiangyin, and others to ignite conflicts at Wuhan University, Huazhong Institute of Technology, Huazhong Normal College, and other units, using the Provincial Democratic League's publication, "Work Briefs," to slander the Communist Party and distribute it to various parts of the country. They also sent people to workers, farmers, and the Wuhan area to sow discord and incite disturbances. Another example is the Cheng Qianfan, Wu Kaibin, and Li Zhengyu clique, which seized organizations such as the "Speaking Out Committee" and the "Press Liaison Station" at Wuhan University, using the third year of the Chinese Department as a base, and through forms such as the "Flame Newspaper," "Debate," and "Forum," launched a series of vicious attacks on the Wuhan University Party organization and many Party members, League members, and activists, and put forward reactionary slogans such as "Strive for Democracy, Strive for Freedom, Strive for Human Rights." They wantonly insulted and threatened the school's Party and government leaders, demanding that the Communist Party withdraw from the school. However, no matter how ferocious and cunning these bourgeois Rightists and their anti-Party cliques were, they were finally forced to reveal their true colors under the weight of "ten eyes watching and ten hands pointing." Nearly 80,000 people participated in this phase of the struggle. Most people, after this phase of the struggle, raised their awareness and stood firm. Some people in the past had questioned whether the "class struggle" mentioned in many editorials of the People's Daily after June 8th was making a mountain out of a molehill, whether it was excessive, or whether it was blocking the channels of expression and suppressing criticism. After this phase of the struggle, they personally witnessed the evil activities and hideous faces of the bourgeois Rightists, thus further recognizing that they must stand firm in this sharp class struggle in order not to lose their way and make mistakes. Many teachers, students, staff, and cadres who participated in the struggle believe that these two months of struggle have been the richest, most vivid, and most educational political lesson. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at its enlarged plenary session from July 29th to 31st, summarized the experience of this phase of the struggle, and after affirming that this phase of the struggle had achieved its first decisive victory, further pointed out that in the units that have already launched the anti-Rightist struggle, further exposure and criticism must be carried out. The right-leaning thoughts such as sentimentality and hastily concluding the battle that exist in a few leading cadres and backbone elements need to be overcome and corrected. Some units, as well as many industrial and mining enterprises, schools, and special county organs, have not yet launched the anti-Rightist struggle, so the anti-Rightist struggle should be extended to all sectors.
    Based on the above situation, the meeting made comprehensive and specific arrangements on how to continue to deepen the political and ideological struggle against the bourgeois Rightists and extend it to all sectors. It is expected that after this meeting, Hubei Province's anti-Rightist struggle will become more in-depth, more comprehensive, and more healthy.

    总结第一阶段的成绩　克服草率收兵的温情主义思想
    湖北反右派斗争即将乘胜扩展到各行各业
    本报武汉31日电　通讯员一丁报道：湖北省反右派斗争已在省市（武汉市）领导机关、大专学校获得了第一个决定性胜利。目前斗争正在向各行各业扩展。自从整风运动开展以来，资产阶级右派借口帮助党整风，向党发动了猖狂的进攻。在湖北、武汉地区的资产阶级右派分子如马哲民（章罗联盟的“大将”之一，民盟湖北省和武汉市主任委员、中南财经学院院长）、耿伯钊
  （大恶霸地主，湖北省安陆县的“土皇帝”，民革湖北省委常委、湖北省参事室主任）、王一鸣（武汉市副市长、市工商联主任委员、民建市委副主任委员）、王一蛟（农工民主党市委委员、湖北省农业厅副厅长）、彭一湖（湖南省岳阳县大恶霸地主、民建中委、市参事室副主任）、晏勋甫（民革市委主任委员、市政协副主席、市参事室主任）、朱裕壁（湖北医学院院长）、程千帆（武汉大学教授）、陈泰阶（华中工学院教授）、韦卓民（华中师范学院教授）、柯象寅（华中农学院教授）、邓介松（政协全国委员会委员）、肖作霖（政协全国委员会委员、市建设局副局长）及党内右派分子、湖北人民出版社副总编辑江云等。为了击退右派分子的疯狂进攻，中共湖北省委及所属党的组织，发动了广大群众，对右派骨干分子进行了批判和揭发，查出了一些大大小小的资产阶级右派分子的反动集团，其中最凶恶的反动集团，如以民盟为掩护的，以马哲民为首的马哲民、戴今生、项粹安、陈中正集团；以省参事室为据点的，以耿伯钊为首的耿伯钊、辜达岸、胡复等七人集团；以武汉大学为据点的、以程千帆、吴开斌（武大学生，与林希翎有密切联系）为首的程千帆、吴开斌、李正宇等人的集团。这些反动集团曾经有组织、有领导、有纲领、有计划地进行了一系列的阴谋破坏活动。例如马哲民反动集团、在马哲民的策划下，除了在中南财经学院进行了许多反党的活动外，还曾经先后指派陆鸣秋、张云冕、韦卓民、艾玮生、陆华柏、高庆赐、陈泰阶、陈中正、柯象寅等人分别在武汉大学、华中工学院、华中师范学院等单位点火，利用省民盟机关刊物“工作简报”，污蔑共产党，并向全国各地散发这个所谓“工作简报”。还派人到工人农民中和武汉附近地区挑拨离间，煽动闹事。又如程千帆、吴开斌、李正宇等人的集团，在武汉大学抓住了“鸣放委员会”、“报刊联络站”等组织，以中文系三年级为阵地，通过“火焰报”、“辩论会”、“座谈会”等形式，向武大党组织和许多党员、团员、积极分子，进行了一系列的恶毒的攻击，并且提出了“争民主、争自由、争人权”等反动口号。对学校党政领导干部肆意谩骂和威胁，要求共产党退出学校。可是，不管这些资产阶级右派及其反动集团如何凶狠狡猾，终于在“十目所视，十手所指”之下，不得不现出原形来。参加这一段斗争的近八万人。多数人经过这一段斗争，提高了觉悟，站稳了立场，过去有些人曾经怀疑人民日报6月8日以后的许多社论上所提到的“阶级斗争”是不是小题大作？是不是有些过火？是不是闭塞言路，压制批评？经过这一段斗争，他们亲眼看到了资产阶级右派的罪恶活动和狰狞面目，从而进一步认识到必须在这场尖锐的阶级斗争中站稳立场，才不致迷失方向，造成错误。许多参加斗争的教师、学生和职工以及机关干部，都认为这两个多月的斗争是最丰富最生动最有教育意义的政治课。中共湖北省委在7月29日至31日召开的全体委员扩大会议上，对于这一段斗争的经验做了总结，在肯定了这段斗争已经获得了第一个决定性的胜利后，进一步指出：在已经开展反右派斗争的单位还必须进一步揭发批判。在少数领导干部和骨干分子中存在着温情主义草率收兵等右倾思想更有待于克服、纠正。有一些单位以及许多工矿企业学校和专县机关还没有开展反右派斗争，因此，应当把反右派斗争扩展到各行各业。
    根据上述情况，会议对于如何使反对资产阶级右派的政治斗争思想斗争继续深入，并扩展到各行各业，做了全面的具体的安排。预计在这次会后，湖北省的反右派斗争将会更加深入，更加全面，更加健康的发展。
