Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 15th: The Chengmen Agricultural Production Cooperative, in its debate on grain issues, specifically discussed the question of "Who benefits from grain black market speculation?" forcefully criticizing the fallacy that "the grain black market is a life-saving benefactor."

From the autumn of last year to before this year's summer harvest, the Chengmen Cooperative of Chengmen Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province, repeatedly discovered some members engaging in grain black market transactions. According to incomplete statistics, these members sold more than 100 dan of grain to the black market alone.

When the great debate began, some members with capitalist ideas openly defended this illegal activity, saying that "black markets arise because grain is too tight, and the black market is a life-saving benefactor for grain-deficient households," advocating that it should not be prohibited. The majority of members opposed this argument and rose up to refute it. Member Lin Wufan said at the meeting, "We have an old well-to-do middle peasant in our cooperative who pretends to be pitiful, repeatedly saying that he doesn't have enough grain and asking his wife to request additional grain from the township government. However, after receiving more grain, he secretly sold 200 jin of grain to the black market. This is fraudulently purchasing grain, engaging in speculation, how can this be considered 'life-saving'?" Elderly member Lin Hongchun said, "Individual farmers in our village only care about personal wealth and disregard the interests of the country and the people. They always delay selling grain under the unified purchase plan and instead take it to the black market. Whose lives are they saving? I think they are saving the lives of capitalist ideology." Member Lin Zhining said at the meeting, "Before liberation, I farmed for the landlord. After paying rent and grain, I only had a little over 10 dan of grain left for the whole year. My family of six only ate a little over 100 jin of grain per person per year. At that time, I was forced to sell my own son. Now that I have joined the cooperative and rely on the protection of the unified purchase and sale of grain policy, my family of nine, the adults eat 517 jin of grain, and the children eat 310 jin. We eat several times more grain than in the past. The unified purchase and sale policy saved our lives."

Next, everyone further analyzed who buys grain on the black market and whether they are truly short of grain and in need of "saving." Everyone agreed that most of them are farmers who use ration grain for sideline occupations, blindly raise ducks, and expand the area planted with cash crops; a small number are farmers who waste grain by holding wedding banquets. There are almost no farmers who should be supplied but are not and therefore go to the black market to buy grain.

After the debate, everyone unanimously affirmed that the unified purchase and sale of grain is the life-saving policy for the broad masses of the people. Everyone calculated several major accounts: before the implementation of unified purchase and sale, the entire cooperative was exploited by grain merchants for 24,000 yuan in grain price differences every year. After the implementation of unified purchase and sale and the establishment of cooperatives, this exploitation was eliminated. Cadre Lin Zhishen said, "In the four years since the implementation of unified purchase and sale, our grain yield has increased from 850 jin per mu to over 1,000 jin, and we have sold more than 800,000 jin of surplus grain to support national industrial construction. The state has helped us build pumping stations. This is our life-saving policy." Finally, the members believed that the grain black market is the resurrection of the rice tiger, the development of capitalism. If this continues, the unified purchase and sale will not be guaranteed, the poor peasants will be exploited again, and the cooperative cannot be consolidated. They expressed their firm opposition to the grain black market.

    闽侯县城门农业社展开一场大辩论
    搞粮食投机买卖对谁有利？
    大家认为：统购统销是救命政策，搞粮食投机是米老虎还魂
    新华社福州15日电  城门农业生产合作社在辩论粮食问题中，专门讨论了“粮食黑市投机对谁有利”的问题，有力地批判了“粮食黑市是救命恩人”的谬论。
    福建省闽侯县城门乡城门社，从去年秋后到今年夏收前，不断发现有些社员进行粮食黑市买卖。据不完全统计，这些社员仅卖给黑市市场的粮食就有一百多担。
    大辩论开始时，某些有资本主义思想的社员，还公开为这种非法活动辩解，说什么“因为粮食太紧才产生黑市，而黑市是缺粮户的救命恩人”，主张不要加以禁止。大多数社员反对这个论调，纷纷起来反驳。社员林梧藩在会上说：“我们社里有个老富裕中农，他装着一副可怜相，口口声声说粮食不够吃，叫他老婆到乡政府请求补发粮食。但是，他多领了粮食，却又偷偷地把二百斤粮食卖给黑市，这是套购粮食，投机倒把，算什么‘救命’？”老年社员林鸿春说：“我们村里个别单干农民，只顾个人发财，不顾国家和人民的利益，统购粮老是拖欠不卖，却把粮食拿到黑市上去卖，这是救了什么人的命，我看是救了资本主义思想的命。”社员林知宁在会上说：“解放前我替地主种地，交租还粮以后，全年只剩十多担粮食，全家六口，每人全年只吃一百多斤粮，那时被迫卖掉了亲生儿子。现在入了社，又靠粮食统购统销政策的保护，全家九口，大口吃粮五百十七斤，小口也吃到三百一十斤，粮食比过去多吃了几倍，是统购统销政策救了我们的命。”
    接着，大家进一步分析买黑市粮食的是什么人，是不是真正缺粮，而需要“救命”的人。大家一致认为，大部分是用口粮搞副业和盲目养鸭子及扩大经济作物种植面积的农户；少部分是结婚办酒席浪费粮食的农户。真正该供应的农户因没供应，而去黑市买粮几乎没有。
    经过辩论，大家一致肯定粮食统购统销，才是广大人民的救命政策。大家算了几笔大账：实行统购统销前，全社每年要受粮商粮食差价的剥削二万四千元，实行统购统销和办合作社后，这些剥削都被铲除了。干部林知深说：“实现统购统销四年来，我们粮食产量从每亩八百五十斤提高到一千多斤，而且卖出八十多万斤余粮支援国家工业建设，国家帮助我们建立抽水机站，这才是我们的救命政策。”最后，社员们认为，粮食黑市是米老虎还魂，是发展资本主义，再让搞下去，统购统销就没保障，贫苦农民又要受剥削，合作社也不能巩固，他们表示坚决反对粮食黑市。
