    Talking About Insiders and Outsiders
    Yi Feng
    The People's Daily reported on July 1st, under the title "Communists Have No Skills They Cannot Learn," the moving stories of four comrades, Zhao Wengang, Aiding, Su Hanyun, and Zeng Yangqing, who transformed from outsiders to insiders on the industrial front. On July 6th, it published news stripping the "omnipotent scientist" mask off the rightist Qian Weichang. These two news items provide a stark contrast. People cannot help but ponder the dialectics of life from this comparison: science belongs to honest people; on the scientific front, as long as Communist Party old cadres are honest and diligent, they can completely transform from outsiders to insiders. Conversely, if one is not honest, like those who proclaim themselves "omnipotent scientists," they are precisely not insiders but outsiders.
    Comrade Zhao Wengang worked for landlords from the age of eleven, and joined the Red Army at fourteen. Comrade Aiding is a Communist Party member with nineteen years of Party membership. They both transferred to the industrial front after liberation. The situations of Comrades Su Hanyun and Zeng Yangqing are roughly similar. In their new work positions, these comrades humbly learned, worked diligently, consulted with the masses on issues, overcame various difficulties, and attacked the fortress of science and technology, transforming from experts in class struggle to insiders in production struggle within a few short years. These exemplary cases once again reveal a very ordinary yet extremely important truth: Communist Party members are indeed made of special material, no matter how shamelessly Zhang Naiqi raves about this point. To deeply understand the phrase that Communist Party members are made of "special material," more explanation is needed. Here, I will only point out one thing, and that is the spirit of unwavering perseverance of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains that our Communist Party members possess.
    Anyone who has read "Liezi" cannot fail to notice its "Tang Wen" chapter, because in this chapter there is a very beautiful story of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains. The Foolish Old Man of North Mountain, at the age of ninety, disregarding the ridicule of the "Wise Old Man of the River Bend," resolved to have his descendants move the Taihang and Wangwu Mountains, which were seven hundred li away and ten thousand ren high, in front of his house, and actively acted by hammering at the rocks and digging at the soil. Finally, he moved God, who sent the two sons of Kua'e to descend to earth and carry the two mountains away—this is indeed a beautiful mythical story, which vividly depicts the heroic and fearless image of the great Chinese people refusing to bow their heads in the face of difficulties. This image has inspired the fighting hearts of thousands upon thousands of Chinese people for thousands of years.
    I remember that Chairman Mao, at the Seventh National Congress of the Party, called on the entire Party to use the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains to dig away the two reactionary mountains weighing down on the Chinese people—feudal forces and imperialism. Sure enough, in the few years after the Seventh National Congress of the Party, the Communist Party members and the Chinese people, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains, overthrew the national and class enemies, completed the democratic revolution, and established the great socialist country. We used ironclad facts to answer the ridicule of the large and small "Wise Old Men of the River Bend" from all sides at that time. They no longer had the qualifications to say that we could not lead the Chinese revolution and were not good at conducting class struggle.
    However, in the new era—the period of socialist construction—the large-scale, stormy mass class struggle like that in the revolutionary period has basically ended (although we are still engaged in intense and fierce ideological and political class struggle today). The Party's task is to lead the people of the whole country to fight against nature, to declare war on the natural world. History has issued a new call to advance to the communist fighters, and has put forward a new test for the old Communist Party cadres, that is, we were able to complete the great cause of the Chinese democratic revolution with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains, and we must continue to carry forward the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains to complete the great cause of socialist construction. And precisely at this time, large and small "Wise Old Men of the River Bend" appeared again, saying: You Communists are experts in revolution, experts in class struggle, but you are not experts in construction, you have no culture, no technology, no science, you are ignorant and unskilled, you are country bumpkins, and so on. The leading singers of this tune are rightists like Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Luo Longji said: "The contradiction in China today is that the petty-bourgeoisie intellectuals of the proletariat are leading the large intellectuals of the petty-bourgeoisie." Therefore, they believe that in the national scientific institutions and universities, Communist Party members should be asked to "get out" and implement something like "scientists govern the institute" and "professors govern the school." In essence, they are attempting to replace the socialist scientific line with the bourgeois scientific line, and attempting to abolish the Party's leadership in the scientific field. The reactionary scientific program formulated by Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang and others is the concrete embodiment of this conspiracy.
    Of course, we Communists have never concealed our shortcomings. We have always said that there are many things we do not understand, and many of us still lack the necessary scientific and cultural knowledge, and some things must be learned from scratch. But it must also be explained that our lack of these things is not our own fault, but because we were oppressed and exploited in the old society. The landlord class and the capitalists deprived us of our right to study, forcing us to "lose our education in our youth"! Many of our comrades were forced to go to Liangshan because of severe class oppression, and they started a revolution and joined the Communist Party and learned Marxism-Leninism under the danger of being beheaded at any time. The Party and the people taught us the greatest knowledge in class society—the knowledge of class struggle, the greatest science—the science of Marxism-Leninism. We relied on this science to bring about earth-shaking changes in China. According to this historical experience, we Communists firmly believe that the things we lack today can definitely be learned and obtained. Was it not possible for the Party in the past to train thousands upon thousands of sons of the working people to become outstanding politicians and military strategists, and is it not possible today to train them to become outstanding scientists? Will the Communist Party members who were not afraid of being beheaded or bleeding for the revolution in the past be stingy with their energy to attack the fortress of science and technology for socialist construction today?
    And the vivid deeds of Comrades Zhao Wengang, Aiding, Su Hanyun, and Zeng Yangqing reported in the People's Daily on July 1 are so inspiring precisely because they answered this question with ironclad facts. They continued to carry forward the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains, and achieved outstanding achievements in attacking the fortress of science and technology. We believe that within our Party, on all fronts, deeds similar to those of Comrade Zhao Wengang and the other three comrades will emerge one after another!
    Similarly, it is in this sense that we read with great interest the news in the People's Daily on July 6 about stripping the "omnipotent scientist" mask off the rightist Qian Weichang. We know that the vast majority of scientists in China are patriotic, love socialism, support the leadership of the Party, and are willing to join hands with old Communist Party cadres to advance to science. In the news published in the People's Daily on July 1 mentioned above, we have already seen the joy and excitement of engineers such as Yuan Shuli and Li Gen for the old cadres who have learned science and technology. They are the scientists of the people, and they are the good teachers and helpful friends of Communist Party members. In New China, there are many people like engineers Yuan Shuli and Li Gen. However, here we cannot fail to notice that there are also people like Qian Weichang in the ranks of scientists. As Professor Du Qinghua said: Qian Weichang's academic prestige far exceeds his scientific level. He has won this prestige by deceiving the Party's trust. He particularly likes others to regard him as a great expert, likes to fill the role of an insider in all aspects of science, pretends to understand when he doesn't, and has a tendency to swagger and show off in science. As Professor Qian Xuesen said, "Qian Weichang is completely a liar who uses political tricks. He has no scientific flavor at all and is the most vicious and ruthless political careerist." Qian Weichang and Zeng Zhaolun, wearing the cloak of scientists, acted as military advisers to the Zhang-Luo Alliance, formulated a reactionary scientific program, and attempted to knock down Communist Party members on the scientific front and seize the Party's leadership in the scientific community. May I ask, in the New China of the 1950s, for a scientist not to recognize the leadership of the Communist Party, and attempt to overthrow the socialist scientific program, that is to say, to use the bourgeois scientific program to pave the way for capitalist restoration. Isn't this the number one anti-science in the world? Isn't this a violation of even the slightest bit of scientific common sense that even three-foot-tall children in China would understand? Scientists who are loyal to science will draw their own conclusions here.
    Our motherland is in a great era of socialist construction, and the scientific power it needs is endless. It needs not only thousands upon thousands of social scientists, but also thousands upon thousands of natural scientists. Our scientific workers should, under the strong leadership of the Party, move towards the peak of the times with the development of socialist construction, and strive to raise our scientific cause to the international level by the time the third five-year plan is completed. This is what the Party and the people demand of us, and it is the historical mission that our scientific workers cannot shirk. Therefore, our scientific workers inside and outside the Party should unite closely, learn from each other, work together, and forge ahead courageously. First, I hope that the old Communist Party cadres will learn from Comrades Zhao Wengang, Aiding, Su Hanyun, and Zeng Yangqing, continue to carry forward the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains, and strive to transform from outsiders to insiders on the scientific front as soon as possible. And I hope that Comrade Zhao Wengang and the other three comrades will not be arrogant or complacent on the basis of the achievements they have already made, and continue to work hard. Second, I hope that scientists inside and outside the Party can all learn a lesson from Qian Weichang and Zeng Zhaolun in the struggle against the rightists. Science is science, and it cannot be faked in the slightest. Science is the most honest thing, and scientists should be the most honest people.

    谈谈内行和外行
    一峰
    人民日报7月1日在“共产党人没有学不会的本领”的标题下，报道了共产党员赵文刚、艾丁、苏汗云、曾扬清四位同志在工业战线上由外行变成内行的动人新闻；7月
  6日又登载了剥下右派分子钱伟长“万能科学家”外衣的消息。这两条新闻是一个鲜明的对比。人们不能不从这个对比中思索着生活中的辩证法：科学是属于老实人的，在科学战线上，共产党的老干部只要是老实肯干完全可以从外行变成内行；相反，如果不是老老实实，像那种自封为“万能科学家”的人，倒恰恰不是内行而是外行。
    赵文刚同志十一岁就跟地主家扛活，十四岁参加了红军，艾丁同志是有着十九年党龄的共产党员，他们都是解放后才转到工业战线上来。苏汗云、曾扬清同志的情况也大体相似。这些同志在新的工作岗位上，虚心学习，刻苦工作，遇事与群众商量，克服种种困难，向科学技术的堡垒进攻，在短短几年内，从阶级斗争的能手变成了生产斗争的内行。这些模范的事例再一次地揭示出一条极平凡而又极重要的真理：共产党员确实是特殊材料制成的，不管章乃器对这一点进行着怎样无耻的狂吠，要深刻理解共产党员是“特殊材料”制成的这句话，需要作更多的说明，我在这里只指出一点，那就是我们共产党员所具备的坚忍不拔的愚公移山的精神。
    凡是读过“列子”的人都不能不注意到它的“汤问”篇，因为在这一篇里有一段极优美的愚公移山的故事。北山愚公以九十之年，不顾“河曲智叟”的讥笑，下定决心要子子孙孙相继移掉他屋前方七百里、高万仞的太行、王屋两座大山，并且叩石垦壤，积极行动。终于感动了上帝，他派了夸娥氏二子下凡把两座大山背走了——这确实是一段优美的神话故事，它生动地刻划了伟大的中国人民不肯在困难面前低头的英勇无畏的形象，这个形象，几千年来，激励着中国人民千千万万颗战斗的心。
    记得毛主席在党的第七次全国代表大会上，曾号召全党要以愚公移山的精神来挖掉压在中国人民头上的两座反动的大山——封建势力和帝国主义。果然不错，在党的第七次代表大会以后不多的几个年头，共产党人和中国人民一道以愚公移山的精神，打倒了民族的和阶级的敌人，完成了民主革命，建立了伟大的社会主义国家。我们用铁的事实回答了在当时来自各方面的大大小小的“河曲智叟”的讥笑，他们再也没有资格说我们不能领导中国革命，不善于进行阶级斗争了。
    可是在新时期——社会主义建设时期，像革命时期那样大规模的狂风暴雨的群众阶级斗争基本结束了（尽管我们今天还进行着紧张的、激烈的思想上、政治上的阶级斗争），党的任务就是领导全国人民向大自然作斗争，向自然界宣战。历史向共产主义的战士发出了新的前进的号角，向共产党老干部提出了新的考验，这就是我们能够以愚公移山的精神完成中国民主革命的大业，我们还必须继续发扬愚公移山的精神来完成社会主义建设的大业。而恰恰在这个时候，又出现了大大小小的“河曲智叟”，说什么：你们共产党是革命的内行，是阶级斗争的内行，可是你们不是建设的内行，你们没有文化，没有技术，没有科学，你们是不学无术，你们是土包子等等。这种调子的领唱人就是右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基之流。罗隆基说：“今天中国的矛盾是无产阶级的小知识分子领导小资产阶级的大知识分子”。因此他们认为在国家的科学机关和大学校里，都请共产党员“滚开”，来一套什么“科学家治院”，“教授治校”之类的东西。这在实质上他们是企图以资产阶级的科学路线代替社会主义的科学路线，企图在科学领域里取消党的领导。由曾昭抡、钱伟长等人所制定的反动科学纲领就是这种阴谋的具体化。
    当然，我们共产党人从来也不掩盖我们的短处，我们从来就说我们有许多不懂的东西，我们中间还有不少的人缺乏应有的科学文化知识，有些东西还必须从头学起。但是还必须说明，我们缺乏这些东西不是我们自己的罪过，而是由于我们在旧社会里受压迫、挨剥削。地主阶级和资本家剥夺了我们的学习权利，迫使我们不得不“少年失修”！我们不少的同志正是由于严重的阶级压迫逼上梁山的，在时时刻刻都有杀头的危险的情况下，闹起了革命，参加了共产党，学习了马克思列宁主义。党和人民教会了我们一门在阶级社会里最大的知识——阶级斗争的知识，最大的科学——马克思列宁主义的科学。我们凭借着这种科学使中国发生了翻天复地的大变化。根据这条历史经验，我们共产党人坚信对于我们今天缺乏的东西，是一定能够学得到、取得来的。难道在过去党有能力把成千上万劳动人民的儿子培养成为出色的政治家、军事家，在今天就没有能力把他们培养成为出色的科学家吗？难道在过去为了革命不怕杀头、不怕流血的共产党员，在今天为了社会主义建设还会吝惜自己的精力来攻夺科学技术的堡垒吗？
    而7月1日人民日报所报道的赵文刚、艾丁、苏汗云、曾扬清四同志的生动事迹之所以那样激动人心，正是因为他们以铁的事实回答了这个问题。他们正是继续发扬了愚公移山的精神，在向科学技术的堡垒进攻中取得了出色的成就。我们相信，在我们党内，在各种战线上，类似赵文刚等四位同志那样的事迹将会是层出不穷的！
    同样，也正是在这个意义上，我们很有兴趣地读了7月6日人民日报关于剥下右派分子钱伟长“万能科学家”外衣的新闻。我们知道，中国绝大多数的科学家是爱国的、爱社会主义的、拥护党的领导、愿意和共产党员老干部并肩携手共同向科学进军的。就是在上面提到的7月1日人民日报刊载的那条消息中，我们就已经看到了袁树励、李艮等工程师对于老干部学会了科学技术那种欢欣鼓舞的心情。他们是人民的科学家，他们是共产党员的良师益友。在新中国，像袁树励、李艮等工程师这样的人是很多的。可是，在这里我们不能不注意到在科学家的队伍里也还有像钱伟长那样的人。正如杜庆华教授所说：钱伟长的学术威望是远远超过了自己的科学水平，他是骗取了党的信任而取得这些威望的。他特别喜欢别人把他看成大专家，喜欢在科学的各方面都充内行，不懂装懂，在科学上有招摇卖弄的倾向。也正如钱学森教授所说，“钱伟长完全是一个说谎话耍政治手腕的人，没有一点科学家的味道，是最恶劣和狠毒的政治野心家。”钱伟长和曾昭抡一起披着科学家的外衣，充当章罗联盟的军师，制定反动的科学纲领，企图在科学战线上打落共产党员，夺取党在科学界的领导权。试问，在二十世纪五十年代的新中国，作为一个科学家而不承认共产党的领导，企图推翻社会主义的科学纲领，那就是说，要用资产阶级的科学纲领来为资本主义复辟开辟道路。这岂不是天字第一号的反科学，这岂不是违反了在中国三尺儿童都会了解到的一点点科学常识？忠实于科学的科学家在这里是会得出自己的结论的。
    我们祖国正处在伟大的社会主义建设时代，它所需要的科学力量是无穷无尽的，它不仅需要成千成万的社会科学家，而且也需要成千成万的自然科学家。我们的科学工作者，应该在党的坚强领导下，随着社会主义建设的发展而走上时代的高峰，争取在第三个五年计划完成的时候，把我们的科学事业提高到国际水平。这是党和人民所要求于我们的，这是我们科学工作者责无旁贷的历史使命。因此，我们党内党外的科学工作者应该紧密地团结起来，互相学习，齐心协力，奋勇前进。第一，愿共产党员老干部向赵文刚、艾丁、苏汗云、曾扬清等四位同志学习，继续发扬愚公移山的精神，争取尽快地在科学战线上由外行变成内行。并愿赵文刚等四位同志在已取得的成绩的基础上不骄不懈、继续努力。第二，愿党内党外的科学家，在反右派的斗争中都能够从钱伟长、曾昭抡那里吸取到教训。科学就是科学，一点也装不得假。科学是最老实的东西，科学家应当是最老实的人。
