    The Democratic League Must Seriously Rectify Itself and Resolutely Counterattack Rightist Elements
    Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League

The China Democratic League, among the democratic parties, has a relatively long history. In the democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, as well as in the early stages of the transition to socialist revolution after the victory of the democratic revolution, it played a certain positive role in the revolutionary cause and has a certain glorious history. This was achieved under the call and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through the joint efforts of the majority of League members who were loyal to the revolutionary cause. However, now that the socialist revolution has basically triumphed, and people of all ethnic groups across the country are further strengthening unity to carry out the great cause of socialist construction, the Democratic League unfortunately has a small handful of rightist elements headed by Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Zhang and Luo, both vice chairmen of the League, seized leadership positions and controlled some local League organizations. Therefore, their overt and covert commands, both within and outside the League, have had an extremely bad influence and effect. As one of the responsible persons of the League Central Committee, I feel very ashamed and pained that the anti-Party and anti-socialist Zhang-Luo alliance has emerged in the Democratic League, openly undermining the Constitution and the League's charter, and bringing extremely serious harm to the people of the whole country. This is truly an unfortunate event. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we can work with the people of the whole country to expose the Luo Longji anti-communist clique and the Zhang-Luo alliance, thoroughly smash their conspiracies, and enable our League to be transformed in the future, more firmly united around the Party, and become a party adapted to socialism, wholeheartedly carrying out socialist construction. This will be the greatest victory for our League. As a matter of fact, since the Democratic League's struggle against the rightists, major gains have been made in a short period of time: first, the League Central Committee has established a revolutionary organizational structure, namely the Central Rectification Leadership Group. This group is currently responsible for all tasks of the League Central Committee, mainly the task of rectification and anti-rightist struggle. At the same time, the League Central Committee's leadership is unprecedentedly unified, and the League's internal unity is unprecedentedly enhanced. All the exposed rightist elements have been isolated and have become rats running across the street, hated by everyone. Secondly, the majority of League members have also received profound education in this anti-rightist struggle and are determined to draw a clear line between themselves and the rightists in ideology and politics. These gains are worthy of our joy and encouragement.

However, there are also a few League members who are greatly disappointed to see the emergence of anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist elements in the League, believing that the Democratic League is "terrible," regretting that they should not have joined the League in the first place, and even feeling discouraged and demanding to withdraw from the League. Some people who originally wanted to join the League now do not want to join. This kind of reaction, of course, has its objective reasons, but it is mainly due to a lack of struggle experience. In my opinion, the emergence of some rightist elements headed by Zhang and Luo in the Democratic League is only hateful and not a strange phenomenon. Because on the revolutionary path, there are constant dropouts, reactionaries, and betrayals, that is to say, one can pass the first hurdle, but not necessarily the second and third. Therefore, those who drop out at any time can only be left to their own devices; those who react and betray at any time can only be defeated and eliminated. People like Zhang and Luo were originally inveterate careerists blinded by lust for gain. Some of them are political rogues, some are pseudo-scholars and pseudo-scientists with political ambitions, and some are social dregs, as the saying goes. These people were all introduced into the League by Zhang and Luo by taking advantage of the past lack of vigilance in the League organization. As for Zhang and Luo themselves, from the early days of the democratic revolution until now, they have been playing two-faced tricks. The reason why we had to unite with them in the past was because they still had a positive side. For example, during the democratic revolution, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, regardless of their motives, were somewhat anti-Chiang, so uniting them into the revolutionary camp was beneficial to the revolution. As for their negative side, we believed that we could educate and transform them with facts. Therefore, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, whether inside or outside the League, they have been placed in the most important positions. However, not only did they not serve the people loyally, but on the contrary, the more the revolution moved forward, the farther they were from the people. The more the Party and the people valued them, the more arrogant and conceited they became, to the point of plotting to oppose the leadership of the Party and overthrow socialism in order to realize their capitalist dreams. However, they misjudged the situation and overestimated their own reactionary forces, while underestimating the greatness of the Communist Party and the political level of the people. Thus, their reactionary activities were completely and shamefully defeated. Some of our comrades in the League who lack revolutionary struggle experience did not see this point, so they developed negative thoughts, leading to a comprehensive negation of the Democratic League. This is wrong.

In the considerable period of time to come, the main task of the Democratic League is rectification, and the main content of rectification is currently to universally and deeply launch a resolute struggle against the rightists. We must expose the rightist elements without omission and thoroughly criticize the reactionary fallacies of the rightists until they are completely defeated. All our League members must realize that it is very dangerous not to thoroughly defeat the rightists. Never think that they are only ideological and political errors. In fact, the activities of the anti-communist group headed by Zhang and Luo to subvert the regime have been premeditated for a long time. Therefore, they actively set up strongholds, planted their cronies, greatly developed anti-communist forces, spread various absurd arguments, and put forward reactionary political propositions in an attempt to create a Hungarian incident and establish a capitalist system. Zhang, Luo, and other rightist ringleaders are still stubbornly denying these facts today, not daring to admit them, because their conspiracies and crimes are very serious. Obviously, if the conspiracies of the rightist elements were to succeed, our socialist cause would be destroyed. Therefore, the struggle against the rightists is a political life-and-death class struggle, a struggle in ideology and politics of who will win between socialism and capitalism. If all our League members do not thoroughly defeat the rightists within the League in this struggle, it will be impossible for the Democratic League to coexist with the Communist Party for a long time and jointly enter a socialist society. Similarly, if each League member cannot wage a resolute struggle against the rightists, we ourselves will not be able to pass the hurdle of the socialist revolution and become active members in building a socialist society. Therefore, the rectification movement of the Democratic League is not only a struggle against the rightists and to purify the organization, but also a profound political education and self-transformation struggle, that is, a struggle to determine the political destiny of the Democratic League.

The majority of the members of our Democratic League are bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals. It is natural that there are still various things in our minds that are incompatible with socialism. Now the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country only solves the problem of an economic base, that is, the private ownership of the means of production has been basically transformed into ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. However, the capitalist elements in our minds have not changed with the change of the economic base. We must make our thoughts adapt to the base so that we can become an active force in building socialism. In the past great social transformation movements, the members of our Democratic League have received a certain degree of education and have made a certain degree of improvement. It is precisely because of these movements and exercises that we have the political and ideological basis for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the Communist Party. However, some of the past transformation movements have only solved the problem of distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves to a certain extent. But among us intellectuals, there has not yet been an in-depth education and transformation of the two lines of socialism and capitalism. The struggle of rectification and anti-rightists that we are carrying out now is precisely such an education and transformation movement. Therefore, all our League members, from the central to the grassroots, must participate in this struggle without exception, relentlessly exposing and thoroughly criticizing the rightist elements, and at the same time, using socialist ideology to defeat the capitalist remnants in our minds.

The anti-rightist struggle is also a detailed, complex, and arduous task. For example, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and other rightist elements all have deep-rooted reactionary histories, and they have also been practicing the tricks of fox spirits for a long time, making it difficult for them to suddenly repent. Look at their confessions in the past month. They have clearly been engaging in subversive activities against the Party with a long-term premeditation, plan, and arrangement, but they stubbornly quibble, shamelessly deny, or minimize their guilt, falsely confessing, merely describing their reactionary words and deeds as ideological errors. They are clearly rightists and the leaders of the rightists, but they repeatedly claim to have been used by the rightists, or even say that they are leftists, as if there is another rightist. Especially Luo Longji, his history has always been composed of an anti-communist clique. Since the secret talks in Beidaihe last summer, he and Zhang Bojun, from a contradiction over the competition for personal rights, have transformed into a coordination against communism and socialism. The Zhang-Luo alliance, with all the facts there, he actually imitates Zhang Naiqi's cunning and sophistry, thinking he has succeeded. Therefore, for the anti-rightist struggle, first, do not underestimate the enemy, and second, do not have any sentimentality. Be accurate and ruthless, hit the key points. This should be different from using gentle and drizzling methods to solve contradictions among the people. But this does not mean using simple and rude methods, but rather seeking truth from facts, having sufficient evidence, condemning with justice, and refuting with truth, so that their ugly faces and sinful words and deeds are exposed in broad daylight, leaving no room for denial.

In order to correctly carry out the anti-rightist struggle, we must follow the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao to judge who are rightist elements. Those who clearly oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose the socialist system are rightist elements. As for those who are only generally ideologically backward and have vague understandings, they cannot be regarded as rightist elements. For such people, we can only criticize their wrong understandings or wrong statements to improve their political awareness and strive for them to stand firm. In this great blooming and contending, due to time constraints, some rightist elements who have not yet been exposed will inevitably adopt more hidden methods to lie dormant. Therefore, it is necessary to observe their words and deeds on a regular basis, which requires conducting detailed investigation and research work, so that no rightist element will escape. Some rightist elements even pretend to be leftists and mix into the organizations of the anti-rightist struggle. We must pay more attention to clearing them out, otherwise, they will become stumbling blocks to our rectification and anti-rightist work, or even make our rectification and anti-rightist work incomplete. Our guiding principle for rectification and anti-rightists is "raise the left, unite the middle, and smash the right." League organizations at all levels must clearly and resolutely implement this guiding principle. Therefore, in the movement, we must try our best to win over the people in the middle and even the middle-right to actively participate in the anti-rightist front, so that they can receive profound education in the practice of struggle, so as to prevent them from staying in the middle for a long time or being used by rightist elements.

The task of all our comrades in the Democratic League is to actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle, participate in the League's rectification, defeat the rightist elements, greatly improve all League members politically and ideologically, make the Democratic League pass the socialist hurdle well, and transform the Democratic League into a truly socialist party in politics and organization. This is the glorious responsibility incumbent upon all League members.

    民主同盟必须认真整风坚决反击右派分子
    中国民主同盟副主席　高崇民
    中国民主同盟在民主党派中，历史是比较久的，在反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的民主革命中，以及在民主革命胜利后，向社会主义革命过渡的初期，对革命事业起了一定的积极作用，有一定的光荣历史。这是在中国共产党的号召与领导之下，忠实于革命事业的大多数盟员共同努力所取得的。但在社会主义革命已基本胜利，全国各族人民正在进一步地加强团结进行伟大的社会主义建设的今天，民主同盟不幸竟有以章伯钧、罗隆基为首的一小撮右派分子的出现。章、罗两人都是民盟的副主席，窃据领导地位，控制了某些地方盟组织，因此，他们在盟内外无论明的暗的发号施令，都起到极恶劣的影响和作用。我个人也是盟中央负责人之一，在民盟出现了反党反社会主义的章、罗联盟，公然破坏宪法和盟章，给全国人民带来极其严重的危害，我是非常惭痛的。这实在是一件不幸的事。但是在共产党的领导下，我们能与全国人民一道把罗隆基反共小集团和章、罗联盟揭发出来，彻底粉碎他们的阴谋活动，使我们民盟今后能获得改造，更加巩固地团结在党的周围，成为与社会主义相适应的一个党派，全心全意地进行社会主义建设，这将是我们盟最大的一个胜利。事实正是这样，自从民盟反右派斗争以来，在短暂的时间内，已经取得了重大的收获：首先是盟中央建立起革命性的组织机构，即中央整风领导小组，这个小组在目前担负起盟中央的一切任务，主要是整风反右派的任务，同时盟中央领导上的思想空前地一致了，盟内的团结空前地增强了，一切被揭发的右派分子，已经陷于孤立，成为人人喊打的过街老鼠了；其次是大多数盟员在此次反右派斗争中，也得到了深刻的教育，坚决要和右派在思想上和政治上划清界限。这些收获是值得我们欢欣鼓舞的。
    不过也有少数盟员同志，看到盟出现反党反社会主义的右派分子而大失所望，认为民盟“糟透了”，后悔自己当初不该入盟，甚至灰心泄气要求退盟；有些原来要求入盟的人，现在也不想入盟了。这种反映，当然有其客观原因，但主要是缺乏斗争经验。在民盟出现以章、罗为首的一些右派分子，我认为只是可恨，并不是什么奇怪的现象。因为革命的途程上，是不断有掉队、有反动、有叛变的，也就是说能过第一关，不一定能过第二关和第三关。故随时掉队者，只有听之；随时反动和叛变者，只有击败和清除他们。若章、罗之流，原是一贯利欲熏心的政治野心家，他们有的是流氓政客，有的是抱政治野心的假学者和假科学家，有的是俗语所说的社会渣滓，这些人都是章、罗利用过去盟组织警惕性不高的机会，引进盟内来的。至于章、罗本人，从民主革命初期一直到现在，都是玩弄两面派手法的，我们过去所以要团结他们，就是因为他们尚有积极的一面，例如在民主革命时期，章伯钧和罗隆基不管其动机如何，总有几分是反蒋，所以把他们团结到革命的阵营里来，于革命是有好处的；对于他们消极的一面，我们认为可以用事实教育改造过来，故从中华人民共和国成立以来，不论盟内盟外，都把他们摆在最重要的地位，而他们不但不忠诚为人民服务，相反，革命越是向前发展，他们与人民的距离就越远，党与人民越是重视他们，他们就越是骄横狂妄，以致阴谋反对党的领导，推翻社会主义，以实现其资本主义的幻梦。不过，他们把形势估计错了，更过高地估计了自己的反动力量，而过低地估计了共产党的伟大和人民的政治水平，于是他们的反动活动完全遭到可耻的失败。我们盟内一些缺乏革命斗争经验的同志们，没有看到这一点，所以产生消极思想，以致对民盟全面地否定，这是错误的。
    在今后相当的时期内，民盟的主要工作就是整风，而整风的主要内容，目前就是普遍和深入地展开坚决反右派的斗争，一定要无情地把右派分子一个不漏地揭发出来，彻底地批判右派的反动谬论，直到完全打垮右派分子为止。我们全体盟员必须认识，如不彻底打垮右派，是十分危险，绝不要认为他们只是思想上和政治上的错误。实际上，章、罗为首的反共集团这个颠覆政权的活动，是蓄谋已久，所以他们积极布置据点，安插党羽，大大发展反共的力量，散播各种荒谬的论点，提出反动的政治主张，企图制造一个匈牙利事件，建立资本主义制度。章、罗等右派罪魁，到今天尚顽强抵赖，不敢承认这些事实，就是因为他们的阴谋罪行是十分严重的。显然，右派分子的阴谋如果得逞，我们的社会主义事业就要被毁灭，所以反右派的斗争，是政治上你死我活的阶级斗争，是思想政治上社会主义与资本主义谁战胜谁的斗争。我们全体盟员如不在这场斗争中彻底战胜盟内的右派，民盟就不可能与共产党长期共存，共同走入社会主义社会。同样，每个盟员如不能与右派作坚决的斗争，我们自己就不可能渡过社会主义革命这一关，而成为建设社会主义社会的积极分子。所以民主同盟的整风运动，既是反对右派、纯洁组织的斗争，又是深刻的政治教育和自我改造的斗争，亦即抉择民盟政治命运的斗争。
    我们民盟的成员，大多数都是资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子，在我们的思想中，还存在着各种各样的与社会主义不相适应的东西，这是很自然的。现在我国社会主义革命的基本胜利，只是解决了一个经济基础问题，就是将生产资料的私人所有制基本上变成了全民和集体所有，但是我们思想中的资本主义因素，还没有随着经济基础的改变而有所改变，必须使我们的思想与基础相适应，我们才能成为建设社会主义的积极力量。在过去历次伟大的社会改造运动中，我们民盟的成员都受到了一定的教育，有了一定的提高，正因为经过了这些运动和锻炼，才使我们有与共产党长期共存，互相监督的政治思想基础。但过去的一些改造运动，只是在一定的程度上为我们解决了分清敌我的问题。可是在我们知识分子中，一直还未深入地进行过社会主义与资本主义两条路线的教育改造。现在我们所进行的整风反右派的斗争，正是这样的一个教育和改造运动。所以我们全体盟员，从中央到基层，都要毫无例外地参加到这场斗争中来，对右派分子进行无情地揭发和彻底地批判，同时，要用社会主义思想战胜我们头脑中的资本主义残余。
    反右派的斗争，也是一个细致复杂的艰巨工作，例如章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器等以及其他右派分子，都有其根深蒂固的反动历史，又有其久经岁月狐狸精式的修炼，他们都很难憣然悔悟。试看他们一月以来的交代吧，明明是蓄谋已久，有计划有布置地进行对党的颠覆活动，而竟矢口诡辩，厚颜狡赖，或避重就轻，认罪诈降，仅仅把他们的反动言行说成是思想上的错误；明明本人就是右派且是右派的首领，而他们却口口声声说成被右派所利用，甚至说成自己是左派，仿佛另外还有一个右派似的。尤其罗隆基，从他的历史上一贯地就组成了一个反共小集团，到去年夏间由北戴河密商起，又和章伯钧由争夺个人权利的矛盾，一变而为反共反社会主义的协调，事实俱在的章罗联盟，而他竟效法章乃器刁狡诡辩，以为得计。故我们对于反右派的斗争，第一不要轻敌，第二不要有丝毫温情主义，要准要狠，击中其要害，这与用和风细雨的办法解决人民内部矛盾，应当有所不同。但这不等于说要用简单粗暴的方式，而是要实事求是，有充分的根据，以正义相谴责，用真理来驳斥，使他们的丑恶面目和罪恶言行暴露在光天化日之下，毫无抵赖之余地。
    为了正确地进行反右派的斗争，我们要遵照毛主席所指示的六项政治标准来判定哪些人是右派分子。明显反对党的领导反对社会主义制度的人们，就是右派分子；至于只是一般思想落后和认识模糊的人，还不能作为右派分子看待，对于这类人，只能就其错误认识或错误言论加以批判，使其提高政治觉悟，争取他们站稳立场。在此次大鸣大放中，因时间关系，有尚未及暴露的右派分子，一定会采取更隐蔽的方式潜伏下来，因此，必须从平日考察其言行如何，这就要进行细致的调查研究工作，才不会使一个右派分子漏网。有些右派分子竟伪装左派而混入反右派斗争的组织中，要更加注意清查出来，否则，他们就会成为整风反右派的绊脚石，甚或使我们整风反右派的工作，不能彻底。我们整风反右派的方针是“提高左派，团结中间，粉碎右派”，各级盟组织必须明确，坚决地贯彻执行这个方针。因此，我们在运动中对于中间甚至中间偏右的人们，要尽可能地争取他们积极地参加到反右派的战线上来，使他们在斗争的实践当中受到深刻的教育，以免他们长期停留在中间或受右派分子的利用。
    我们民盟全体同志的任务，就是积极地参加反右派斗争，参加盟的整风，把右派分子打垮，使全体盟员在政治上和思想上大大提高，使民盟过好社会主义这一关，把民盟在政治上、组织上改造成为真正的社会主义党派。这是全体盟员义不容辞的光荣的责任。
