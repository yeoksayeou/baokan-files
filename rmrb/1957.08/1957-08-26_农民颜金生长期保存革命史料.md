    Peasant Yan Jinsheng Preserved Revolutionary Historical Materials for a Long Time
    In 1930, Yan Hui, the person in charge of the CCP Danyang County Committee, entrusted some important Party documents to his relative Yan Jinsheng (a peasant) for safekeeping because our Party was forced to operate underground in the area at that time. In July 1931, Comrade Yan Hui was arrested and sacrificed by the Kuomintang military police. Yan Jinsheng, disregarding the extremely dangerous environment at the time, hid the documents in the pigsty, risking his life, and survived the long period of White Terror under the Japanese puppet regime and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang until liberation, when he returned the documents to the CCP Danyang County Committee for safekeeping.
    This batch of documents, totaling more than 100 pieces, are mostly important documents issued by the CCP Central Committee in 1929 and 1930, and some documents of the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee (such as the resolutions of the Second Congress of the Jiangsu Provincial Party). Because they were well preserved, most of them are as good as new. From the perspective of revolutionary historical materials that have been discovered in the Jiangsu region, this batch of documents is relatively early and has extremely important historical value.
    Yan Jinsheng's preservation of the Party's historical documents is meritorious. The local Party and government organs have recently commended him at a cadres' meeting and in the Danyang County newspaper. The General Office of the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee has also given him material rewards. (Cai Jisheng)

    农民颜金生长期保存革命史料
    1930年，中共丹阳县委负责人颜辉同志因当时当地我党被迫处于地下状态，就把一些党的重要文件寄存在亲属颜金生（农民）家里。1931年7月，颜辉同志被国民党军警逮捕后牺牲。颜金生不顾当时十分险恶的环境，把文件藏放在猪圈里，冒着生命危险，度过了日伪和国民党反动统治的长期白色恐怖，直到解放，才把文件交还中共丹阳县委保管。
    这批文件，共有一百余件，绝大部分是1929、1930年中共中央所发的重要文件和中共江苏省委的一部分文件（如江苏省第二次党代表大会的决议等），由于保藏得好，大多完整如新。从江苏地区已发现的革命历史材料来说，这批文件年代较早，有着极为重要的历史价值。
    颜金生保存党的历史文件有功，当地党政机关最近已在干部大会和丹阳县报上表扬了他，中共江苏省委办公厅并给了他物质奖励。（蔡继生）
