Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 18th. In the spirit of rectification while correcting, many factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel are actively improving their work.

These factories and mines have established a system for leading cadres to go deep among the masses, going to workshops and workers' dormitories to help solve problems. After the Communist Party Committee Secretary of the First Preliminary Rolling Mill went deep into the workshop, he discovered that the ventilator was blowing hot air instead of cold air. He immediately asked the equipment assistant to repair it. This problem had not been solved for the past three months, but now it was solved in one morning, which made the workers very happy.

Anshan Iron and Steel has also recently transferred nineteen department-level cadres to strengthen the leadership of factories and mines, and the factory and mining enterprises have also placed some section chiefs into the work teams to strengthen grassroots leadership. Leading cadres from ten functional departments of Anshan Iron and Steel have also led ten inspection teams to factories and mines such as the Iron Smelting Plant, the Second Steel Plant, and the Dagushan Iron Mine, which have achieved excellent production results or are facing difficulties, to help summarize advanced experiences and solve key production problems, promoting the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign.

Now, all factories and mines have begun to pay attention to applying the working method of the mass line. Units such as the Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine have also set up people's reception rooms in the workers' dormitories, stipulating that administrative and Party leaders take turns receiving workers and solving various problems raised by the workers.

Anshan Iron and Steel's leading cadres also pay attention to solving the problems of workers' living and welfare. More than 160,000 square meters of workers' housing, invested by the state and built using company and factory director funds this year, is currently under construction and, when completed, can accommodate more than 5,000 households of workers. Welfare work in various factories and mines has also been improved, with beds set up for workers changing shifts to allow them to rest. The workers' canteens have added variety to the dishes, and some factories and mines have also established nutritional canteens and Muslim canteens, all of which are welcomed by the workers.

    问题发现得早解决得快
    鞍钢许多厂矿建立领导干部深入群众的制度
    新华社鞍山18日电　鞍钢许多厂矿贯彻边整边改精神，积极改进工作。
    这些厂矿建立了领导干部深入群众的制度，到车间和职工宿舍去帮助解决问题。第一初轧厂的中共党委书记深入车间以后，发现通风机不送冷风反而吹着热风，他立即要设备助理进行修理。这个问题过去三个月没有解决，现在一个上午就解决了，工人非常高兴。
    鞍钢最近还抽调十九名处级干部充实厂矿的领导，厂矿企业也将一部分工段长放到班组中去加强基层领导。鞍钢十个职能处的领导干部也带领了十个检查小组，深入到炼铁厂、第二炼钢厂、大孤山铁矿等生产成绩优良和存在困难的厂矿去，帮助总结先进经验和解决生产关键问题，推动了增产节约运动的开展。
    现在，各厂矿都开始注意了运用群众路线的工作方法。大石桥镁矿等单位还在职工宿舍中设立了人民接待室，规定行政和党群领导干部轮流接待职工，解决职工提出的各种问题。
    鞍钢领导干部还注意解决职工生活福利方面的问题。今年由国家投资和利用公司、厂长基金修建的十六万多平方公尺职工住宅，目前正在加速兴建，完工以后，可以容纳五千多户职工居住。各厂矿的福利工作也都有些改进，他们给换班的工人设置了床铺，使工人可以得到休息。工人食堂增添了菜的花样，有的厂矿并且建立了营养食堂和回族食堂，这些都受到工人们的欢迎。
