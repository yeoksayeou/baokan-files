When people mention the police of the old society, they immediately think of a series of evil nouns in the dictionary: extortion, aiding the wicked, committing all kinds of crimes... The people give their own police glorious titles such as "helping the old and caring for the young" and "serving the people." The changes between the two eras are so profound. Right-wingers like to make comparisons. Well, this can also be considered a comparison. (Attached pictures)

    两个时代
    人们一提起旧社会的警察，就会联想到辞典中一连串形容罪恶的名词：敲榨勒索、助纣为虐、无恶不作……。人民对自己的警察，却给予“扶老携幼”，“为人民服务”等光荣称号。两个时代，变化竟是如此的深刻。右派分子是喜欢对比的。那么，这也算是一个对比吧。（附图片）
