Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 21st: The delegations from Asian and African countries participating in the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, issued a joint declaration on August 20th, based on a resolution passed by the Japanese delegation at a meeting on the last day of the World Conference (August 16th). The full text of the declaration is as follows:

    We, the representatives of Asian and African countries – Burma, Ceylon, China, Egypt, India, Japan, North Korea, Mongolia, Thailand, and the Soviet Union – gathered in Tokyo to participate in the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, unanimously agree after the conference to issue the following declaration based on the basic principles of the resolutions passed at the conference:

      (1) Asian and African countries with long and sacred civilizations are now striving to establish a new era of national independence and world peace. In 1955, the government representatives of the twenty-nine Asian and African countries participating in the Bandung Conference, in accordance with the will of 1.5 billion Asian and African people, adopted a resolution against the use of nuclear weapons and against colonialism.

      (2) Recently, certain events have occurred in the Asian and African region that threaten the peace and independence of this region. Although the armed aggression against Egypt has ended in failure, international tensions in the Middle East and various regions of Asia and Africa are still gradually increasing in different forms. Foreign fleets possessing nuclear weapons have been sent to the waters off Lebanon to interfere in the affairs of Jordan and the Arab world. Foreign armed forces are carrying out aggression against the people of Oman, foreign jet fighters are strafing the people of Oman, and foreigners continue to commit atrocities in Algeria. Regardless of Japanese national sentiment and historical tradition, the Okinawa Islands have been separated from Japan and are being turned into foreign atomic nuclear bases. Foreign countries are transporting nuclear weapons into Taiwan, an indivisible part of the territory of the People's Republic of China, and establishing atomic bases there, which is another serious and dangerous act of aggression that threatens peace. Atomic weapons are being transported into South Korea in violation of the armistice agreement. As the strategy of great powers shifts to a strategy of atomic nuclear war, military bases established for the needs of military blocs are being converted into atomic nuclear war bases. The establishment of foreign atomic bases and the transportation of atomic nuclear weapons undermine national independence and increase the risk of atomic war. The establishment of new atomic nuclear bases in any Asian or African country is a threat to the security of the entire Asian and African region.

    (3) Regardless of the will of the people of Asian and African countries, nuclear weapons tests are still being conducted continuously in the Pacific Ocean. Countries possessing atomic weapons conduct experimental explosions in the Pacific Ocean, far away from their own territories, in order to avoid harming themselves. However, the fission materials produced by the experimental explosions fall on the people of Asian and African countries. These tests are conducted to develop technologies for mass destruction. Large-scale nuclear weapon test explosions are now planned for Eniwetok Atoll next year. Other experimental explosions are also being planned.

      (4) We demand:

    甲、Countries possessing atomic weapons conclude an unconditional agreement to ban experimental explosions.
    乙、Asian and African governments recommend to the next United Nations General Assembly an unconditional ban on nuclear weapon test explosions; the United Nations take the necessary steps to ensure the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the implementation of universal disarmament.
    丙、Cancel all future plans for experimental explosions, including the Eniwetok Island test.
    丁、Countries possessing atomic weapons stop establishing atomic bases and stop transporting nuclear weapons or atomic reinforcement task forces into foreign bases.

    The realization of these goals will greatly contribute to world peace and national independence. In order to implement the above goals, we should do everything possible to consolidate cooperation between all countries, regardless of differences in ideologies or religious beliefs among the different strata of the people of each country; we will do everything possible to consolidate international cooperation on a global scale. In view of the great contribution made by the Asian Countries Conference held in New Delhi in April 1955 to the unity of the people of the countries in this region, we believe that it is very important to hold an Asian-African nations conference as soon as possible in the same spirit.

                                   August 20, 1957, Tokyo

### 参加东京大会的亚非国家代表宣言　决心巩固合作制止原子战争　主张尽早举行一次亚非国家会议

    参加东京大会的亚非国家代表宣言
　　决心巩固合作制止原子战争
　　主张尽早举行一次亚非国家会议
    新华社东京21日电　参加第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会的亚非国家代表团，在8月20日根据日本代表团在世界大会最后一天（8月16日）的一次会议上通过的决议发表了一项联合宣言。宣言全文如下：
    我们，由于参加第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会而聚集在东京的亚非国家——缅甸、锡兰、中国、埃及、印度、日本、朝鲜、蒙古、泰国和苏联——的代表们，在会后一致同意根据会上通过的各项决议的基本原则发表下列宣言：
      （一）拥有悠久而神圣的文明的亚非国家，现在正在为建立民族独立和世界和平的新时代而奋斗。1955年，参加万隆会议的二十九个亚非国家的政府代表，根据十五亿亚非人民的意志，通过了一项反对使用核武器和反对殖民主义的决议。
      （二）最近，亚非地区发生了某些事件，威胁着这个地区的和平和独立。虽然对埃及的武装侵略已经以失败而告终，但是中东和亚非各地区的国际紧张局势仍然在以不同的形式逐渐加剧。拥有核武器的外国舰队被派到黎巴嫩海面来干涉约旦和阿拉伯的事务。外国武装部队对阿曼人民进行侵略，外国喷气式战斗机对阿曼人民进行扫射，外国人继续在阿尔及利亚制造暴行。不顾日本的民族情绪和历史传统，冲绳群岛被从日本割裂开来，并且正在变成外国的原子核基地。外国把核武器运入中华人民共和国领土不可分割的一部分的台湾，并且在那里建立原子基地，这是威胁和平的另一个严重而危险的侵略行为。原子武器正在违反停战协定的情况下被运入南朝鲜。随着大国的战略转变为原子核战争的战略，为了军事集团的需要而建立的军事基地，正在被改成原子核战争基地。外国原子基地的建立和原子核武器的运入，破坏了民族独立，增加了发生原子战争的危险。在任何亚非国家建立新的原子核基地都是对整个亚非地区的安全的一种威胁。
    （三）不顾亚非国家人民的意志，核武器试验仍旧不断地在太平洋上进行。拥有原子武器的国家为了避免伤害自己，就在远离自己领土的太平洋上进行试验性爆炸。试验性爆炸所产生的裂变物质却落在亚非各国人民身上。进行这种试验是为了发展大规模毁灭的技术。现在正在计划明年在恩纳威托克岛进行大规模的核武器试验性爆炸。还有其他试验性爆炸也在计划中。
      （四）我们要求：
    甲、拥有原子武器的国家缔结无条件禁止试验性爆炸的协议。
    乙、亚非国家政府向下届联合国大会建议无条件禁止核武器试验性爆炸；联合国采取必要的步骤，保证禁止核武器和实行普遍裁军。
    丙、取消将来一切进行试验性爆炸的计划，包括恩纳威托克岛的试验。
    丁、拥有原子武器的国家停止建立原子基地，停止把核武器或者原子增援特遣部队运进外国基地。
    这些目标的实现将大大有助于世界和平和民族独立。为了实行上述目标，我们应该尽一切力量巩固一切国家之间的合作，不论各国人民不同阶层的意识形态或者宗教信仰有什么不同；我们将尽一切力量巩固国际规模的合作。鉴于1955年4月在新德里举行的亚洲国家会议对这一地区各国人民的团结作出了巨大贡献，我们认为根据同样的精神尽早举行一次亚非国家会议是非常重要的。
                                   1957年8月20日　于东京（附图片）
　　第三届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会8月12日至16日在东京举行。这是大会开幕的情形。
