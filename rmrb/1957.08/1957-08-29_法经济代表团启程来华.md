　　French Economic Delegation Departs for China
　  Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 27th: The economic delegation led by Henri Rochereau, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the French Republic Senate, left Paris by plane this afternoon via Hong Kong for Beijing.
    Rochereau told Xinhua reporters at Orly Airport that the delegation's main mission was to discuss technical issues in China, as trade issues between France and China have already been resolved.
    Rochereau led an economic delegation to China in 1955, when they studied the issue of developing economic and trade relations between China and France. They also signed two agreements with relevant Chinese parties on these issues. The current delegation's purpose is to study the possibility of economic and technological cooperation between China and France.
