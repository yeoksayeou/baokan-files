    Facing Production, Combining with Reality
    Sichuan Rural Areas Build a Batch of Middle Schools
    The Unreasonable Phenomenon of Over-Concentration in Cities is Gradually Changing
    (Our Newspaper) News: In order to correctly implement the policy of secondary education serving production, Sichuan Province is gradually changing the unreasonable phenomenon of middle schools being over-concentrated in cities, and dispersing newly built middle schools to the countryside.
    The province currently has 524 middle schools and 7,724 classes (excluding primary schools with attached junior middle school classes), of which 63% of the schools and 73% of the classes are concentrated in provincial, special municipality, and county-level cities. Although the population of these cities is less than one-twelfth of the province's total population, they concentrate the vast majority of middle schools, while the vast rural areas have only 198 middle schools. In Leshan County, all five middle schools are located in the city. In Nanchong, nine of the twelve middle schools are in the city. In Yuechi County, all eight middle schools were originally distributed in the townships, but later, due to an overemphasis on standardization, they were merged into four and concentrated in the city. This abnormally concentrated situation not only increases the economic burden on the state and farmers due to the construction of school buildings, etc., and makes it impossible for students from distant and poor peasant families to attend school, causing dissatisfaction among the peasants, but also easily breeds undesirable tendencies such as belittling labor, coveting urban life, and being unwilling to participate in production because students are separated from rural areas and family labor for a long time. The schools also make it difficult to implement the education policy oriented to rural areas because they are separated from rural life.
    The Sichuan Provincial Department of Education began to pay attention to changing this situation last year. This year, except for cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Zigong, all special counties have stopped building schools in cities, and all 70 newly built and newly established middle schools have been rationally distributed in the countryside. Hechuan County has newly established four middle schools in rural areas, giving young people in the surrounding rural areas within 20 to 30 li the opportunity to attend school. In the past, Gaoliang Town in Neijiang had no middle school, and some students had to travel 100 to 200 li to study. Now, with the newly established middle school, the number of students has increased by more than 300. In the Qinggang District of Shehong County, in the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily, a middle school with 300 to 400 students was established in old houses and temples with the support of the masses. After the middle schools in various places were dispersed to the countryside, they were generally welcomed by the masses because they could reduce expenses, enroll more students, and easily participate in labor and learn agricultural knowledge.

    面向生产　结合实际
　　四川农村新建一批中学中学
　　过分集中在城市的不合理现象正在逐步改变
    本报讯　为了正确地贯彻中等教育为生产服务的方针，四川省正逐步改变中学过分集中在城市的不合理现象，把新建中学分散到乡村去。
    全省现有五百二十四所中学、七千七百二十四个班次（未计小学附设初中班），其中有63％的学校、73％的班次都集中在省、专辖市和县城里。这些城市里的人口虽然还不到全省人口的十二分之一，却集中了绝大部分中学，而广大农村则只有一百九十八所中学。乐山县五所中学全在城内，南充十二所中学就有九所在城内，岳池县八所中学原来都分布在乡镇上，后来片面强调正轨化，合并成四所，集中到城里。这样畸形集中的结果，不仅因修校舍等增加了国家和农民的经济负担，使远路的和贫苦的农民子弟无法上学，引起农民的不满，而且因学生长期脱离农村和家庭劳动容易滋长轻视劳动、贪恋城市生活、不愿参加生产等不良倾向。学校也因脱离农村生活，使面向农村的教育方针难以贯彻。
    四川省教育厅在去年就开始注意改变这种情况，今年除重庆、成都、自贡等城市外，各专县也一律停止在城市建校，并且把新建、新设七十所中学全部合理分布到乡村中去。合川县乡间新设四所中学，使周围二、三十里以内农村的青年都有了上学的机会。内江高梁镇过去没有一所中学，一部分学生读书要跑一、二百里路。现在，新设了中学，学生增加了三百多名。射洪县青杠区根据勤俭办学的精神，在群众支援下尽量利用旧屋、庙舍办了一所三、四百人的中学。各地中学分散到农村以后，由于可以减少开支、多招学生、便于参加劳动和学习农业知识，因此普遍受到了群众欢迎。　（四川记者站）
