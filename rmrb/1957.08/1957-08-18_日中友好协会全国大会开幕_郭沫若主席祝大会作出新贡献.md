Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 17th: The Seventh National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association opened in Tokyo this morning. More than 400 representatives from branches across the country attended the congress.

    Association Chairman Jiichiro Matsumoto said in his speech that the Nobusuke Kishi government has adopted a policy of subservience to the United States, hindering the development of friendly relations between Japan and China. He called on members of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association and the Japanese people to unite, smash artificial obstacles, and strive to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China as soon as possible.

    Subsequently, invited guests including Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma of the Socialist Party, Central Committee member Rimi Hakamada of the Japanese Communist Party, Tadaharu Kuno, representative of the Liberal Democratic Party, Kumaichi Yamamoto, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and Mitsuo Fujioka, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, delivered congratulatory speeches at the congress.

    Secretary-General Shinichiro Omori of the Association gave a report on the work of the past year. He said that 22 new branches of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association have been established in various parts of the country in the past year, and another 14 units are preparing to establish them. He pointed out that this year has been a year of rapid development for the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has developed into a national organization including people and groups from all walks of life, and responsible officials of local government agencies have also actively participated in the branch organizations of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association.

    The Chinese delegation attending the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament was invited to attend the afternoon session of the congress. Delegation leader Cai Tingkai delivered a speech at the meeting, congratulating the congress on its success.

Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, sent a telegram on the 16th to the 7th National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association, expressing his congratulations. This congress is being held in Tokyo, Japan today.

    The telegram said: "I am delighted to learn that the Japan-China Friendship Association will convene its 7th National Congress after the World Conference against Hydrogen Bombs. On behalf of the China Peace Committee, I would like to extend my warm congratulations. In recent years, the people of China and Japan have jointly promoted friendly exchanges and economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, and have advanced side by side in the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. This is inseparable from the continuous efforts of your association to promote it. We wish the conference new contributions to the further development of the friendship between the people of China and Japan.

    Despite the great obstacles to the promotion of Sino-Japanese friendship at present, we firmly believe that the Japanese people are friendly to the Chinese people, and the Japanese people are overcoming difficulties and obstacles and striving to develop Sino-Japanese friendship and restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

    The Chinese people are willing to continue to strengthen unity and cooperation with the Japanese people, and work together to promote the friendly relations between the people of China and Japan and the noble goal of defending peace in Asia and the world.

    I wish the conference a complete success."
