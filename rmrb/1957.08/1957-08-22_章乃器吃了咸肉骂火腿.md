Zhang Naiqi Eats Salted Pork and Criticizes Ham

　　Once upon a time, there was a man with a strange temper, unwilling to admit defeat. Once, he insisted that a black beetle was a black bean. Someone said to him, "Old brother, you are wrong, how can a black bean grow legs?" He said: "Whether it grows legs or not, legs are still black beans." At this time, the black beetle started to crawl, and someone said: "Look, it's walking!" He insisted: "Walking is still a black bean!"

　　You will surely find this story funny. You will say, how can there be such a person in the world! I say, however, there are people like this who recognize black as white today.

　　If you don't believe me, I will tell you a story about Zhang Naiqi eating salted pork and criticizing ham.

　　Around 1955, Minister of Food Zhang Naiqi suddenly had a whim to eat Jinhua ham, so he wrote a letter, attached a few dollars, and sent it to the Jinhua Food Company, asking the company to buy it on his behalf. Buying ham is buying ham, but he had to show off his skills. In the letter, he wrote that he wanted to buy "Southern Meat." Ham can be called "Southern Leg," but "Southern Meat" is salted pork, and "Southern Leg" are two different things. Of course, the company sent him Jinhua salted pork. He tasted it and the taste was wrong, so he insisted that the quality of Jinhua ham had decreased.

　　In 1956, Zhang Naiqi, as a representative of the National People's Congress, inspected the Jinhua Ham Factory. The relevant departments reported to him on the ham production situation, saying that 330,000 hams had been produced in 1955, more than twice the output of 1948 before liberation; and they told him that the state had allocated a large amount of funds to build a number of ham factories with anti-freezing, anti-insect, and anti-rodent equipment in the key ham-producing areas, so the quality of ham was also much higher than before liberation. Zhang Naiqi, without looking at the facts, insisted: "Jinhua ham does not taste as good as before liberation." When several capitalists in Jinhua heard his conclusion, they immediately said: "Minister Zhang is right! State-owned companies are laymen and do not understand the ham business." Some also said: "The Party and the government do not pay attention to ham production, which is a stumbling block hindering the development of production." The capitalists' shouting was nothing more than saying that your socialism is not doing well, let us engage in capitalism!

　　Has the quality of Jinhua ham declined? Recently, Jinhua held a district-wide professional meeting, inviting many experts from the scientific and technological circles and people from all walks of life to participate. Everyone went to the site to observe carefully and said that the quality of the current ham is much higher than before liberation.

　　Some people will say that it was a misunderstanding, and if Zhang Naiqi had eaten real ham, he would not have persisted in his error. I think that's not necessarily the case. Zhang Naiqi, this rightist element, has a different appetite from us. He hates our socialism. No matter how well we do, he will not say a good word. Like the joke above, even if he sees the black beetle crawling, he will still say it is a black bean. Therefore, rightist elements are not only ridiculous, but also very hateful. (Shi Hong, Li Yue)

　　章乃器吃了咸肉骂火腿
    从前有一个人，脾气古怪，死不服输。有一次，他把一只黑壳虫说成是黑豆。别人对他说：“老兄，你错了，黑豆怎么会生脚？”他说：
  “管它生脚不生脚，生脚也是黑豆。”这时，黑壳虫爬动起来了，别人说：“你看，它在走路啦！”他一口咬定：“走路也是黑豆！”
    你听了这个故事，一定好笑。你会说，天下哪有这种人！我说，但是，类似这种认黑作白的人，今天也有。
    你不信，我讲一段章乃器吃了咸肉骂火腿的故事。
    1955年间，粮食部长章乃器忽然心血来潮，想吃金华火腿，就写了一封信，附了几块钱，寄给金华食品公司，托公司代买。买火腿就是买火腿，偏偏要卖弄一手，他在信里写成买“南肉”。火腿可以叫“南腿”，“南肉”就是咸肉，和“南腿”是两样东西。公司当然就把金华咸肉寄给了他。他一尝味道不对，就一口咬定金华火腿质量降低了。
    1956年，章乃器以全国人民代表大会代表的身份到金华火腿厂视察。有关方面就向他汇报火腿生产情况，说，1955年已经生产了三十三万只火腿，比解放前1948年的产量增加了两倍多；而且告诉了他，国家拨了大批款子在重点产火腿区兴建了一批有防冻、防虫、防鼠设备的火腿厂，所以，火腿质量也比解放前提高了不少。章乃器不看事实就硬说：“金华火腿没有解放前好吃了。”他这个结论，给金华几个资本家听到了，马上说：“章部长的话不错呀！国营公司是外行，不懂火腿业务。”有的又说：“党和政府不重视火腿生产，是阻碍生产发展的绊脚石。”资本家这样的叫喊，无非是说，你们社会主义搞不好，还是让我们来搞资本主义吧！
    金华火腿质量是不是下降了呢？最近金华召开了一次全区专业会议，邀请很多科学技术界的专家和各界人士一道参加，大家到现场去仔细观察，都说，现在的火腿质量不晓得比解放前提高好多。
    有人会说，那是误会，如果章乃器吃到真火腿，就不会坚持错误了。我看，这也未必。章乃器这个右派分子，和我们的胃口不同。他对我们社会主义有仇。随便我们搞得怎样好，他也不会说一个好字。跟前面那个笑话一样，即使他看到黑壳虫在爬，还是要说它是黑豆，所以，右派分子不仅是可笑，而且很可恶。　（石红　里跃）
