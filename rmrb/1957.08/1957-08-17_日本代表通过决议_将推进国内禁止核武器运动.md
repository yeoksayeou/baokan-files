Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 16th: Japanese representatives attending the Third World Conference Against Hydrogen Bombs held a meeting today during the conference's lunch break and passed a resolution on promoting the domestic movement to ban nuclear weapons in Japan.

    The resolution requests the Japanese government to abandon its support for the idea of establishing a nuclear weapon test registration system and to immediately submit a proposal to the United Nations for concluding a treaty banning nuclear weapon testing. The resolution points out that, in order to achieve the conclusion of a treaty banning nuclear weapons, the Japanese government should call on Asian and African countries to take unified action and should make the greatest efforts within the United Nations.

    The resolution expresses opposition to the United States turning Okinawa Island into a nuclear war base, opposition to the United States transporting nuclear weapons into Japan and turning Japan into a nuclear war base; and demands the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and opposition to promoting an atomic war system.

    The resolution states that, in order to achieve the banning of nuclear weapons and the peaceful use of atomic energy, the Japanese people will launch unified action starting this October, demanding that the Japanese government and the United Nations implement the resolutions passed by the World Conference.

    The resolution also calls on the Japanese government to promptly formulate laws to aid victims of atomic and hydrogen bombs.

    After the meeting, the Japanese representatives also held a demonstration in the city.
