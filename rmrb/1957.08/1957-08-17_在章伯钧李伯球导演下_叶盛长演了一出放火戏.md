Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The entire staff of the China Peking Opera Theater held multiple meetings in recent days, exposing that Ye Shengzhang, an actor and rightist element in the Peking Opera Theater, was a vanguard in the Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu rightist clique's attack on the China Peking Opera Theater.

In order to seize leadership in the Peking Opera world, Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu started fires in the Peking Opera Theater after the Communist Party's rectification campaign began. On May 24th, they sent one of their henchmen, Xing Wenxin, to organize a symposium in the Peking Opera circle and asked Ye Shengzhang to provide a list of invitees from the Peking Opera Theater. Ye Shengzhang first pulled in his elder brother, Ye Shenglan. Xing Wenxin was overjoyed and immediately reported to Li Boqiu to claim credit. Li Boqiu said with satisfaction: "Good! A breakthrough has been made in the Peking Opera Theater. This must be done well and deepened! The Peking Opera Theater is a banner for the entire Peking Opera world. If we take this down, the whole Peking Opera world will be no problem." Then, he secretly instructed three major steps: First, hold a good symposium to expand the influence of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party; second, develop the organization; and third, establish a branch. He pointed out that "first seize the big shot, Ye Shenglan," and organize a "full-scale offensive with Li Wanchun and Ye Shengzhang as the core."

On June 6th, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held its first symposium in the Peking Opera circle, presided over by Li Boqiu. At the beginning, several veteran artists discussed some artistic issues. Li Boqiu, Xing Wenxin, and others immediately passed notes to Ye Shengzhang, saying "the atmosphere is insufficient" and telling him to speak quickly. Ye Shengzhang took the order and then spouted nonsense, doing his best to distort the facts, spread rumors, and slander, attacking the Peking Opera Theater. The atmosphere in the meeting immediately changed. He said: "The Peking Opera Theater is all the same, you can join the Party if you know how to flatter"; "The Peking Opera Theater has no political freedom"; "The Peking Opera Theater is shrouded in an iron curtain"; "The Peking Opera Theater is a one-party dictatorship, there is no democracy, and the actors are like prisoners"; "The Peking Opera Theater does not care for the actors, it simply wants to kill all the old artists and cultivate communist actors"; "The administrative cadres of the Peking Opera Theater are not proficient in their business, the State Council should consider having experts lead them and change the people!" Li Boqiu, Li Wanchun, and others listened while cheering and applauding. Zhang Bojun and Huang Qixiang also came to the scene to supervise. Li Jiansheng said to Zhang Bojun: "Today's meeting was very successful." After the meeting, Zhang Bojun and Li Boqiu specially kept Ye Shengzhang, Ye Shenglan, and others for dinner, instructing Ye Shengzhang to invite more people next time, to broaden the scope, not limited to levels, as long as they are dissatisfied with the Communist Party, they can be recruited, and personally ordered Ye Shengzhang to submit a supplementary list.

Li Boqiu saw that Ye Shengzhang was "absolutely loyal" and praised Xing Wenxin with great satisfaction, saying: "Ye Shengzhang is young, capable, and can speak well. Hold on to him tightly, treat him as a core member, and he has great potential." Ye Shengzhang quickly joined the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and actively recruited soldiers and horses for the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to develop its organization.

The main target of the rightist elements of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party was Ye Shenglan, and they used Ye Shengzhang as a springboard to win over Ye Shenglan. Ye Shengzhang bargained with Xing Wenxin about this, saying: "My fourth brother (Ye Shenglan) is a good performer, and if you want to win over such a representative figure, you have to give him a position!" Xing Wenxin promised to report to the higher authorities. Ye Shengzhang said again: "Precisely because my fourth brother is a good performer, unlike us, there are two requirements: first, he must meet Chairman Zhang - based on his reputation and status, it is indeed better for Chairman Zhang to talk to him; second, a branch must be established, otherwise there is no mass base." Xing Wenxin immediately reported to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and told Ye Shengzhang that there was no problem and that Ye Shenglan's requirements could definitely be met.

After the struggle against the rightists began, Xing Wenxin secretly arranged a retreat plan for Ye Shengzhang. He said: "Zhang Bojun has been exposed, which has affected our work. The branch should not be established for the time being, but we must secretly hold on to Shenglan. Zhang Bojun is Zhang Bojun, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, stand on the position of opposing Zhang Bojun, and others will not suspect you!" Ye Shengzhang said at the time: "Now they say that Elder Zhang is anti-Party and anti-people, I don't think that's necessarily true!" Xing Wenxin said again: "That's not how you should say it, you should speak in accordance with the Communist Party and the Communist Party members, and express opinions that the majority agree with, so that you will have mass prestige, the Communist Party will trust you, and future work will be easier!" Ye Shengzhang said: "Yes, I will say more good things in the future."

Despite Ye Shengzhang's stubborn resistance at the general meeting of the entire staff of the China Peking Opera Theater, under everyone's exposure and criticism, Ye Shengzhang's consistent reactionary face from before liberation to the present was finally revealed.

    在章伯钧李伯球导演下
    叶盛长演了一出放火戏
    新华社16日讯  中国京剧院全体人员连日举行了多次会议，揭露出京剧院演员、右派分子叶盛长是章伯钧、李伯球右派集团向中国京剧院进攻的急先锋。
    章伯钧、李伯球为了夺取京剧界的领导权，在共产党整风开始后，就向京剧院点火。5月24日派遣他的一名爪牙邢文鑫组织京剧界座谈会，并且要叶盛长提供对京剧院演员的邀请名单。叶盛长首先拉上了他的哥哥叶盛兰。邢文鑫喜出望外，马上找李伯球汇报邀功。李伯球满意地说：“好！京剧院的缺口已经打开，要好好地做，要抓紧深入下去！京剧院是全国京剧界一面大旗，这方面打下来，整个京剧界就不成问题了。”接着又密示三大步骤：一、开好座谈会，扩大农工民主党影响；二、发展组织；三、建立支部。并指出“先抓住大头儿叶盛兰”，组织“以李万春、叶盛长为核心的全面进攻”。
    农工民主党北京市委会在6月6日举行第一次京剧界座谈会，由李伯球主持，开始时几位老艺人探讨了艺术上的一些问题，李伯球、邢文鑫等立即给叶盛长递条子，说“气氛不足”，叫他赶快发言，叶盛长领命，接着大放厥词，极尽颠倒黑白、造谣诽谤的能事，向京剧院进攻，会场空气马上为之一变。他说：“京剧院清一色，会拍马就可以入党”；“京剧院没有政治自由性”；“京剧院铁幕重重”；“京剧院一党专政，没有民主，演员如同犯人”；“京剧院不爱护演员，把所有旧艺人干脆都弄死，要培养共产主义的演员”；“京剧院行政干部对业务不内行，国务院应考虑内行来领导，换一换人！”李伯球、李万春等一边听着，一边喝采称快。章伯钧、黄琪翔也先后到场督阵，李健生向章伯钧说：“今天的会开得太成功了。”会后，章伯钧、李伯球特地留下叶盛长、叶盛兰等人吃晚饭，指示叶盛长下次要多请人，面要广，不限级别，只要对共产党不满就可网罗，又亲命叶盛长提出补充名单。
    李伯球看出叶盛长已“忠心耿耿”，非常满意地向邢文鑫赞许说：“叶盛长年轻能干，会讲话，把他紧紧抓住，作为核心分子，大有可为”。叶盛长很快地就参加了农工民主党，并且积极地为农工民主党招兵买马，发展组织。
    农工民主党右派分子主要争取对象是叶盛兰，他们把叶盛长作为争取叶盛兰的一个跳板。叶盛长为此曾找邢文鑫讨价还价，说：“我四哥（叶盛兰）是个好角，要争取这样一个有代表性的人物，不给地位不行！”邢文鑫答应向上面反映。叶盛长又说：“正因为我四哥是好角，不比我们，所以有两点要求：第一要见章主席——凭他的声望地位，也确实让章主席和他谈谈才好；第二要成立支部，不然没有群众基础。”邢文鑫立刻向农工民主党北京市委汇报，并且向叶盛长表示不成问题，一定可以满足叶盛兰的要求。
    反击右派的斗争开始后，邢文鑫向叶盛长秘密布置退却的办法。他说：“章伯钧被揭发了，给我们的工作带来影响，支部暂时不要成立，但还要暗中抓紧盛兰，章伯钧是章伯钧，农工党是农工党，站在反对章伯钧的立场，别人就不会怀疑你！”叶盛长在当时说：“现在说章伯老反党反人民，我看还不见得！”邢文鑫又说：“不是这样讲，要顺着共产党和共产党员说话，发表大多数人同意的意见，这样才会有群众威信，共产党才会信任你，以后的工作才好做！”叶盛长说：“对，以后我就好话多说。”
    尽管叶盛长在中国京剧院全体人员大会上进行顽抗，但在大家的揭发和批判下，叶盛长从解放前到现在一贯的反动面目终于被揭露出来。
