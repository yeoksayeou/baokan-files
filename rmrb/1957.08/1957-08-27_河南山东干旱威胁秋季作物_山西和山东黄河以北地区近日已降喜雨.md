　　Drought in Henan and Shandong Threatens Autumn Crops
　  Welcome Rain Recently Falls in Shanxi and Areas North of the Yellow River in Shandong
    (Our dispatch) Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi have been widely threatened by drought in recent months. In the past few days, except for rainfall in most parts of Shanxi and areas north of the Yellow River in Shandong, the threat of drought remains severe.

    Currently, the effective soil moisture content in the plains areas of Henan Province is only 10%, and in the hilly areas it is less than 10%. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on the 22nd, requiring local leaders to take the lead in participating in drought resistance, and socialist education can be combined with drought resistance work.

    In the mountainous areas of the Linyi, Laiyang, and Tai'an prefectures of Shandong, where the drought situation is more serious, the ground has been dry down to two to four inches, and autumn crops will be reduced; in the cotton-producing areas of Huimin and Liaocheng prefectures, there has been shedding of bolls and buds. Drought resistance, prevention, yield protection, and seed protection campaigns have been launched throughout the province.

    Most areas of Shanxi Province experienced rainfall on the 24th and 25th. The rainfall in the Taiyuan area reached 63 millimeters, and the rainfall in Jinzhong, Jinbei, and the Taihang Mountains varied, but it was beneficial to autumn crops.

　　河南山东干旱威胁秋季作物
　  山西和山东黄河以北地区近日已降喜雨
    本报讯　河南、山东、山西近月以来，普遍遭受干旱威胁。最近几天，除山西大部地区和山东黄河以北地区降雨外，干旱威胁仍然严重。
    目前，河南全省平原地区的土壤有效含水率仅10％，丘陵地带不足10％。中共河南省委已于22日发出指示，要求各地领导人员带头参加抗旱，社会主义教育可以结合抗旱工作进行。
    山东旱情较严重的临沂、莱阳、泰安等专区的山岭地带，地面已旱下二寸至四寸，秋季作物将减产；棉产区的惠民、聊城两专区的棉田，出现落铃、落蕾现象。全省各地已开展抗旱、防旱、保收、保种运动。
    山西省大部地区在24日、25日降雨。太原地区降雨量达六十三公厘，晋中、晋北和太行山区降雨量不等，但对秋季作物都有好处。
