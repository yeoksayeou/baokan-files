In the Dattai mountainous region, more than 50 kilometers northwest of Beijing, the first pair of modernized vertical shafts in the Jingxi Mining Area are under construction. At present, the auxiliary shaft and some roadways, as well as welfare facilities, have been completed and put into use; the main shaft, belt conveyor corridor, railway, and other projects can be completed this year, and all will be handed over for production by July next year.

This pair of modern vertical shafts was designed by our country itself, and from coal mining to transportation, all are equipped with mechanized equipment. The annual output of anthracite coal will be close to half of the current annual coal production of all mines under the Jingxi Mining Bureau.

The reporter accompanied comrades from the shaft construction site to visit the mine. The main transportation roadway underground is very wide, and the arch is built of concrete. The track laying and wiring projects in the roadway have been mostly completed. In the future, the coal mined from each mining area will be loaded into mine cars by loading machines and transported directly to the shaft entrance by electric locomotives. On the ground, there is a belt conveyor corridor more than 200 meters long, spanning a clear river and reaching the railway station on the north bank, which can transport the coal to the coal storage yard or automatically load it into carriages for outward transportation. Now, the steel structure of the belt conveyor corridor has been erected, waiting for the installation of the belt conveyor equipment. (Attached picture)

### 现代化大台竖井快要建成  产量等于京西矿区的一半

    现代化大台竖井快要建成
    产量等于京西矿区的一半
    在北京城西北方向五十多公里的大台山区，正在建设着京西矿区的第一对现代化的竖井。目前，副井和一部分巷道、福利设施已经完工开始使用；主井、皮带运输走廊、铁路等工程在今年内都可以完工，明年7月就能全部移交生产。
    这对现代化的竖井是由我国自己设计的，从采煤到运输，全部采用机械化设备。它每年生产的无烟煤，接近目前京西矿务局所属各矿煤炭年产量的一半。
    记者曾随同建井处的同志到井下去参观。井下主要运输巷道非常宽大，拱顶是混疑土砌筑的。巷道的辅轨和架线工程已经大部完成。将来各采区采的煤，由装岩机装入拖罐，就由电机车直运井口。在地面上有一条长二百多公尺的、横跨一道清水河直达北岸火车站的皮带运输走廊，可以把煤运到储煤仓或自动装入车厢外运。现在，钢结构的皮带运输走廊横架已经矗立起来，正待安装皮带运输设备。（附图片）
