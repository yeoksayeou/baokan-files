Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th - At the preparatory meeting of the Second Session of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress today, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, analyzed the general situation of the struggle against bourgeois rightists in Shanghai, saying: After more than two months of struggle, Shanghai's anti-Rightist struggle has achieved a decisive victory. Hundreds of thousands of people have been involved in the struggle, and rightists have been exposed batch after batch, and have been refuted to the point of being speechless and defeated. However, some people are unwilling to admit defeat, so this struggle must be deepened and carried through to the end in order to win a complete victory.

Ke Qingshi pointed out that everyone must have a clear stand in the anti-Rightist struggle and must participate in this struggle. He called on all the people of Shanghai, all walks of life, from leading organs to grassroots organizations, including neighborhood residents' committees, to conduct a city-wide rectification and debate in stages and batches, so that millions of people can participate in this movement and undergo a profound socialist education.

More than a thousand Shanghai Municipal People's Representatives and observers will hold a half-month People's Congress meeting starting today. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will also hold a plenary meeting. The countless debates held on all fronts in Shanghai over the past two months to counterattack bourgeois rightists will converge on these two city-wide forums to launch a more systematic and in-depth exposure and criticism of rightists. The struggle at the meeting will cooperate with the anti-Rightist fronts of democratic parties, literature and art, news, publishing, education, health, industry and commerce, etc., to push the city's anti-Rightist struggle to a new climax.

In the previous stage of the struggle in Shanghai, some important rightists have been exposed, and a number of rightists have also been exposed in many grassroots units. These rightists are mainly of three types: one is the right wing of the democratic parties during the original democratic revolution, who played a leading and organizing role in this rampant attack on the Communist Party and socialism; one is the former power holders who are unwilling to withdraw from the stage of history and came out this time thinking that the world had changed; and another is people who have always been politically dissatisfied, as well as other bourgeois elements who resist the socialist revolution. Some of these rightist groups and rightist backbone elements are directly under the command of the Zhang-Luo alliance and other rightist careerists, and some have inextricable links with these rightist groups and rightist elements. More and more materials prove that this attack launched by rightists across the country against the Communist Party and socialism was completely programmatic, organized, planned, and mutually reinforcing, and Shanghai was an important base for the rightists' attack.

In the previous stage of the struggle, almost everyone was tested, forming a strong mass force in the anti-Rightist struggle. Many people who were originally in an intermediate state also joined the anti-Rightist struggle after the true faces of the rightists were exposed, making the anti-Rightist struggle increasingly large-scale. On the eve of the preparatory meeting of the People's Congress, many worker, peasant and intellectual representatives, based on the experience of the previous stage of the struggle, collected rich materials and prepared to present facts and reasons at the meeting to launch a major debate with the rightists. Hundreds of people from all walks of life who had some understanding of the rightists prepared materials and requested to come to the meeting to expose and criticize the rightists after learning about the convening of the People's Congress.

    柯庆施在人代会上号召把反右派斗争贯彻到底
    全民性的整风和大辩论将在上海分期分批展开
    新华社上海15日电 中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施今天在上海市人民代表大会第二次会议的预备会议上，分析上海市反对资产阶级右派分子斗争的总形势说：经过两个多月的斗争，上海的反右派斗争已经取得了决定性的胜利。投入斗争的人数已达几十万，右派分子已经一批一批地被揭露出来，而且已被驳得理屈词穷、败下阵来。但是还有一些人不愿服输，因此必须把这场斗争深入下去，贯彻到底，争取全胜。
    柯庆施指出，在反右派的斗争中每一个人都要有鲜明的立场，必须参加这一斗争。他号召上海全市人民、各行各业从领导机关到包括里弄居民委员会在内的各个基层组织，都要分期分批地进行一次全民性的整风和大辩论，要使几百万人参加到这个运动中来，经受一次深刻的社会主义教育。
    上海市的一千多位市人民代表和列席代表今天起举行为期半月的人民代表大会会议。同时，政协上海市委员会也举行全体会议。两个多月来上海市在各条战线上为反击资产阶级右派分子而举行的无数次的辩论会，将在这两个全市性的讲坛上汇合起来，对右派分子展开更有系统、更加深入的揭发和批判。会议上的斗争将和会外的民主党派、文艺、新闻、出版、教育、卫生、工商界等各条反右派战线配合，把全市的反右派斗争推向新的高潮。
    上海市在前一阶段斗争中一些重要的右派分子已经被揭发出来，许多基层单位中也揭发出一批右派分子。这些右派分子主要是这样三种人：一种是原来民主革命时期民主党派中的右翼，这些人在这次向共产党和社会主义进行的猖狂进攻中起了带头和组织的作用；一种是过去的当权派，他们不甘心退出历史舞台，这次以为天下大变，也出来了；还有一种是政治上一向心怀不满的人；以及其他抗拒社会主义革命的资产阶级分子。这些右派集团和右派骨干分子，有些是直接受章罗联盟以及其他一些右派野心家的指挥，有些和这些右派集团以及右派分子有着千丝万缕的关系。越来越多的材料证明，这次右派分子在全国向共产党和社会主义发动的进攻完全是有纲领、有组织、有计划、互相呼应的，而上海是右派分子进攻的重要基地。
    在前一阶段的斗争中，几乎所有的人都受到了一次考验，形成了一支强大的反右派斗争的群众队伍。许多原来处于中间状态的人在右派分子的真面孔暴露以后，也都加入到反右派斗争的队伍中来，使反右派斗争规模日益壮大。在人代会举行预备会议的前夕，许多工人、农民和知识分子代表根据前一阶段斗争的经验，收集了丰富的材料，准备在会上摆事实、讲道理，同右派分子展开一场大辩论。数百个对右派分子有所了解的各界人士得到召开人代会的消息以后，也都准备了材料要求到会上来揭发和批判右派分子。
