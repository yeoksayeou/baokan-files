    Nizwa is currently the location of the Omani insurgents' headquarters. British invading forces are advancing towards it from both the north and south.
    Nizwa is the ancient capital of Oman. In 1913, the Omani people revolted against the rule of the Sultan of Muscat, elected an Imam, and re-established the Imamate of Oman, which had existed for a long period of sixty-five years before. Nizwa became the capital of the Imamate, and the Imam was stationed here. The Sultan of Muscat and the Imam of Oman concluded the Treaty of Seeb in 1920, formally recognizing the independence of the Imamate. However, in December 1955, the troops of the Sultan of Muscat, under the command of British officers, forcibly occupied Nizwa, and Imam Ghalib Alhinai was forced to leave. Now, the people of the Omani tribes have once again launched an uprising and control a wide area. The Imam has returned to Nizwa and is fighting alongside the insurgent people.
    Currently, Nizwa and the Omani people are actively resisting the British invading forces and their vassal, the Sultan of Muscat's troops. The insurgents are using Nizwa's ancient buildings as fortifications. Nizwa has long tomb cellars built thirty meters deep underground, which the insurgents are using as air raid shelters. Nizwa also has a famous, strongly built circular castle, with walls about six meters thick, which the Omani people have long used to fight the enemy. The British Air Force is frantically bombing and strafing this castle and the urban area.
    Nizwa has a strategic location due to its precipitous terrain. It is located in the relatively fertile mountainous region of central Oman, at the southern foot of the Jebel Akhdar mountains, more than 600 meters above sea level. It is located at the gateway from Muscat across the central highlands to the Buraimi Oasis and the interior of Oman. The roads are all camel tracks crossing mountains and valleys. It is about 130 kilometers northeast of Muscat, the Sultan's residence, on the coast of the Gulf of Oman, and can lead northwest through the Buraimi Oasis to the British military base of Sharjah on the Persian Gulf coast, 320 kilometers away. Therefore, Britain is trying to control the Nizwa region in order to ensure its rule over the entire territory of Oman and the Persian Gulf coast, and to gain access to the oil-rich Buraimi Oasis.
    Nizwa is also a commercial center in the Omani interior. According to data from 1951, it has a population of 6,000, while Muscat, the Sultan's residence in Muscat, has a population of 4,200. The town is full of primitive and medieval buildings. It has handicrafts such as leather, pottery, and weaving, and there are copper mines nearby. It is estimated that the Nizwa region may also have rich oil deposits. It is also famous for producing an Arab sweet called Halwa. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

### 阿曼古都尼兹瓦

    阿曼古都尼兹瓦
    尼兹瓦是现在阿曼起义者总部的所在地。英国侵略军队正从南北两路向它进犯。
    尼兹瓦是阿曼的古都。1913年阿曼人民起义，反抗马斯喀特苏丹的统治，选出教长，重新建立了六十五年以前长期存在的阿曼教长国。尼兹瓦就成为教长国的首府，教长一直驻在这里。马斯喀特的苏丹和阿曼教长在1920年订立萨比卜条约，正式承认了教长国的独立，可是1955年12月英国军官指挥下的马斯喀特苏丹的军队强占了尼兹瓦，教长加勒布·阿里被迫离去。现在阿曼各部落的人民又举行起义，控制了广泛地区。教长已经回到尼兹瓦，一直和起义人民在一起进行斗争。
    目前，尼兹瓦和阿曼人民正在积极抵抗英国侵略军及其附庸马斯喀特苏丹的军队。起义者利用尼兹瓦的古代建筑作为防御工事。尼兹瓦有建筑在三十公尺深的地下的长长的墓窖，起义者就利用它来防空。尼兹瓦还有著名的建筑坚固的圆形城堡，它的城墙约有六公尺厚，阿曼人民曾经长期利用它打击敌人。英国空军疯狂地对这个城堡和市区进行轰炸扫射。
    尼兹瓦地势险峻，是一个战略要点。它座落在阿曼中部比较肥沃的山区，在阿克达尔山南麓，拔海在六百多公尺以上。它的位置处于从马斯喀特越过中部高地通向布赖米绿洲及阿曼内地的孔道。道路都是翻山越岭的骆驼道。它东北距靠阿曼湾海岸的马斯喀特约一百三十公里，西北可经布赖米绿洲通向三百二十公里外的滨波斯湾的英国军事基地沙贾。所以英国力图控制尼兹瓦地区，以便确保它对阿曼全境及波斯湾沿岸的统治，并能进窥石油丰富的布赖米绿洲。
    尼兹瓦还是一个阿曼内地的商业中心，据1951年的材料，它有六千人口，而马斯喀特苏丹驻地的马斯喀特的人口是四千二百人。它市镇内都是原始的和中世纪的建筑。它有皮革、陶器、编织等手工业，附近有铜矿。据估计，尼兹瓦地区还可能有丰富的石油矿藏。它还以出产一种叫作哈尔瓦的阿拉伯甜食而著名。　　　　（新华社）（附图片）
