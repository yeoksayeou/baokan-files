In the Waves of Struggle

    Excellent Communist Youth League Member - Tian Di
    Tian Di, a female student in her third year in the Chinese Department of Wuhan University and a member of the Communist Youth League, is a good fighter in this anti-rightist struggle.

    The rightist small group led by Wu Kaibin was the "headquarters" of the rightist students at Wuhan University who attacked the Party during the period of "Great Blooming and contending". They put forward the reactionary slogans of "struggling for freedom, democracy, and human rights" against the Party. For a time, they stirred up a gloomy black wind, making Wuhan University a scene of chaos. In particular, the students in the third year of the Chinese Department were mostly bewildered by this black wind. But Tian Di always stood on the Party's position and fought against the rightists. When the rightist Wu Kaibin published the "Flame News" to attack the Party, she and several classmates ran the "March 8th Society" and published wall posters to counterattack the rightists.

    The rightists tried every means to insult and attack her. A rightist in the same dormitory with her would point fingers and hurl insults at her as soon as she returned to the dormitory, calling her "the filial descendant of the three evils" and "despicable and shameless," and calling her "March 8th" wall poster a "tortoise" poster. But all this did not stop Tian Di from fighting against the rightists, but instead strengthened her fighting enthusiasm. When the rightists in the class wanted to strike and go to the streets to make a big democracy, she published wall posters calling on the students to help the Party rectify its work in a gentle and mild manner, and opposed the practice of big democracy. On June 5th, Liu Zhen, the Secretary of the Wuhan University Party Committee, gave a report to the students of the whole school, criticizing the rightists' practice of going to factories and rural areas to ignite fires and their so-called slogans of "struggling for freedom, democracy, and human rights." After hearing this report, rightists such as Wu Kaibin roared like thunder and immediately incited the students to say, "Now it's being reined in, we must rise up to oppose it." During the discussion of Liu Zhen's report in the third year of the Chinese Department, many people opposed the report, but Tian Di stood up to support the basic spirit of the report. Her speech was constantly interrupted by the jeers and curses of the rightists. Later, she still published an article in the "March 8th Society" supporting Liu Zhen's report.

    During the period of the "Great Blooming and Contending," Tian Di participated in the work of the "Flame News," which was controlled by the rightists. When she realized the reactionary words and deeds of the "Flame News," when others were dizzy, she soberly noticed the anti-Party activities of the rightists such as Wu Kaibin. She kept detailed records of the rightists' activities and reactionary remarks in her diary. Later, when exposing and criticizing rightists such as Wu Kaibin, the materials recorded in this part of the diary were used like heavy bombs to stun the rightists.

    Since Wuhan University launched the anti-rightist struggle, Tian Di's work has become even more intense. She has also been responsible for many tasks such as sorting out materials, writing articles, and taking minutes of meetings, often working late into the night, and sometimes getting very little sleep at noon. Tian Di's spirit of loving the cause of the Party and fighting to uphold the truth has been consistent. From the first grade, she conducted irreconcilable struggles against some bad tendencies of Wu Kaibin and others, who had not yet exposed their rightist features.

    Tian Di's excellent qualities have been commended by the Wuhan University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

    优秀的女共青团员——田蒂
    武汉大学中文系三年级女学生、共青团员田蒂是这次反右派斗争中的好战士。
    以吴开斌为首的右派小集团是武汉大学右派学生在大鸣大放期间向党进攻的“司令部”，他们提出了向党“争自由、争民主、争人权”的反动口号，一时之间，他们掀起了一阵阴森森的黑风，把整个武大闹得乌烟瘴气，特别是中文系三年级的学生，大部被这股黑风吹昏了。但田蒂始终站在党的立场上向右派分子斗争。右派分子吴开斌出“火焰报”向党进攻，她就和几个同学办了“三八社”出墙报对右派分子进行反击。
    右派分子想尽办法辱骂和打击她。一个与她同宿舍的右派分子一回到宿舍就指桑骂槐地骂她是“三害的孝子贤孙”、“卑鄙无耻”，骂她的“三八”墙报是“王八”报。但这一切并未使田蒂停止和右派分子的斗争，反而使她的斗争积极性更加强了。当班上右派分子要罢课、上街闹大民主的时候，她出墙报号召同学帮助党整风要和风细雨，反对大民主的做法。6月5日武大党委书记刘真向全校学生作了一次报告，对右派分子要到工厂、到农村去点火的做法和他们提出的所谓“争自由、争民主、争人权”的口号进行了批评。吴开斌等右派分子听了这个报告后，咆哮如雷，立即煽动同学们说，“现在是收了，要起来反对”。在中文系三年级讨论刘真这个报告时，很多人都反对这个报告，但田蒂站起拥护这个报告的基本精神。她发言时曾不断被右派分子的叫骂声所打断。后来她在“三八社”还是发表拥护刘真报告的文章。
    在大鸣大放的期间，田蒂曾参加了为右派分子所把持的“火焰报”的工作。当她发觉“火焰报”的反动言行后，当别人都在头昏脑胀的时候，她就清醒地注意到吴开斌等右派分子的反党活动。她在日记里把右派分子活动情况和反动言论作了较详细的记载。后来在揭露和批判吴开斌等右派分子时，这部分日记记录的材料就被用来像重磅炸弹一样把右派分子打得目瞪口呆。
    在武汉大学开展反右派斗争以后，田蒂的工作更加紧张了。她又担负着整理材料、写文章、作会议记录等许多工作，经常工作到深夜，有时午睡也很少睡。田蒂热爱党的事业，为坚持真理而斗争的精神是一贯的。她从一年级开始，就和当时还未暴露右派面貌的吴开斌等的一些不良倾向，进行了不调和的斗争。
    田蒂的这种优秀品质已得到中共武汉大学委员会的表扬。
