Title: This dance should only exist in the heavens; It is rare to see it in the world; Soviet artists perform a grand ballet; Two hundred swans dance gracefully; Countless jewels sparkle.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 4th: On the evening of the 3rd, young people from all over the world watched the most spectacular performance at the "Dynamo" stadium - a grand Soviet ballet performance. The stage, set up on the lush green football field, was one and a half times larger than the stage of the Grand Theater. Three major acts were performed on this stage. Some short waltzes were performed on four small circular stages a little further in front.

At half past nine, the stands were full of 40,000 spectators. In the quiet summer night, amidst the melodious music, the first performance was Prokofiev's "The Stone Flower," a winner of the Lenin Prize. Under the illumination of the lights, countless jewels emitted various fantastic and uncertain beautiful colors, making people feel as if they were in a fairyland.

The performance of the second act of "Swan Lake" allowed the world's youth to deeply appreciate the exquisite artistry of ballet. The scenery of the open-air stage, combined with the color of the natural sky, further enhanced the night atmosphere of this act. The floor of the stage was made of organic glass, completely transparent, like a pool of calm, green lake water. The toes of two hundred actors rotated lightly. Their figures appeared on the transparent floor, like reflections in the lake water. This performance won great praise from the audience. The final act was a scene from the ballet "Gayane."

    此舞只应天上有　人间难得几回看
    苏联艺术家表演大巴蕾舞
    二百天鹅翩翩起舞　无数宝石闪闪发光
    据新华社莫斯科4日电　3日晚上，来自世界各国的青年们在“狄纳莫”运动场看了一次最蔚为奇观的演出——苏联巴蕾舞大表演。搭在绿草如茵的足球场地上的舞台比大剧院的舞台要大一倍半。三幕主要的大轴戏就在这个舞台上上演。一些短小的华尔兹舞则在前面一点的四个小巧的圆形的舞台上演出。
    九点半钟，看台上满满地坐了四万名观众。在宁静的夏夜里悠扬的音乐声中，首先演出的是列宁奖金获得者普罗科菲耶夫的“宝石花”。在灯光的映照下，无数的宝石发出了各种各样奇幻无定的美丽色彩，使人宛如置身仙境。
    “天鹅湖”第二幕的演出使世界青年们深深地领略到巴蕾舞艺术的精妙。露天舞台的布景配合着自然天空的颜色更加重了这一幕的夜晚气氛。舞台的地板是由有机玻璃做成的，完全是透明的，像一池平静无波的碧绿的湖水。二百个演员的足尖轻盈地旋转。透明的地板上现出她们的身影，像是湖水中的倒影一样。这次演出赢得了观众的极大的赞赏。最后的一幕是舞剧“加雅?”中的一幕。
