　　The Constantly Throbbing Pulse
　　By our reporter Zhang Jing

    Walking into the trade union of the foundry workshop of Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the most eye-catching thing is the colorful silk banners and certificates of merit hanging on the wall. Among them, there is a certificate of merit framed very exquisitely, which was awarded by the Shanghai Regional Committee of the China Railway Trade Union when it was评为assessed as an advanced workshop trade union committee in 1956.

    One in Every Two and a Half People
    I finally managed to find Chen Quandai, the chairman of the workshop trade union. Unfortunately, he was just about to leave for Beijing to attend the National Conference of Activist Representatives of Trade Unions. In a hurry before his departure, he could only simply tell me: "There is no secret to doing trade union work. The most important thing is to rely on the leadership of the Party and the support of everyone. At the weekly meetings of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League, we receive instructions from the Party and arrange the work of the trade union according to the Party's political work tasks. Otherwise, in such a workshop with more than 700 people, even Guanyin with a thousand hands would not be able to cope."

    In a conversation with Comrade Liu Qingfa, the vice chairman of the trade union, I learned that in addition to the chairman and vice chairman and sixteen committee members, this workshop trade union also has various work committee members, group leaders, and staff in twelve work areas and sixty-seven groups, totaling 298 people (not including those who do not have explicit positions but are enthusiastic about helping the trade union). Compared with the total number of people in the workshop, on average, one in every two and a half people is doing trade union work. They are like cells in an organism, spread throughout the various departments and corners of the workshop, from organizing labor competitions with hundreds of people to resolving marital disputes, from the workshop to the dormitory and even to the homes of workers dozens of miles away from the factory, their traces can be found everywhere. A middle-aged worker told me: "In 24 hours a day, we constantly feel the pulse of the trade union throbbing."

    Six Hundred Tons of Steel is More Important
    In the first half of this year, the steel department accepted a batch of tasks for casting passenger car bogies. According to the original calculation, each furnace of steel could only cast one bogie, and only two bogies could be cast per day with two furnaces. However, often due to changes in the conditions such as adding materials to the steel furnace, the steel could not be completely used and was wasted. At this time, Zhang Yinyan, a worker in the steel department, put forward a rationalization proposal to thicken and raise the bottom and walls of the furnace so that one furnace of steel could cast two bogies at the same time, which could increase production and save 660 tons of steel per year. This proposal quickly received administrative support. Unexpectedly, this proposal was opposed by steel furnace workers and casting and molding workers. Some people said, "It's too troublesome to do this," and some people said, "This change will disrupt our plans." Therefore, despite administrative support, everyone was unwilling to do it. What to do? The trade union production committee convened employee meetings in three work areas to give everyone an account, explaining the value and role of this proposal in the context of the country's raw material supply difficulties, and then mobilized everyone to discuss whether they were willing to save more than 600 tons of steel for the country or willing to have less trouble personally. After discussion, the workers were willing to implement the proposal. It was promoted and implemented after a month of testing.

      "The Tale of Xu and Wang争车"
    Two small blackboards are hung in the raw iron wheel work area, which look simple but attract the employees of the entire work area. Because the content of the blackboards is updated every day, some people call them "work area daily newspapers." On its pages, almost every day someone is praised or criticized. Those who have been criticized by it can generally quickly correct their shortcomings. For example, the roof of the iron smelting furnace workshop was leaking, and rainwater splashed onto the molten iron, causing sparks to fly and affecting the quality of the molten iron. The workers had reported this to the foreman several times, but the foreman, immersed in the achievements of completing the monthly targets, ignored it. Soon, a cartoon appeared on the blackboard: the foreman pointed to the monthly rising target arrow, striking a complacent pose, as if he hadn't seen the roof leaking at all. The day after this cartoon was published, the foreman found someone to repair the roof leak.

    Once, a dispute over the use of a crane occurred in the work area. Both workers emphasized that their tasks were important and held onto the crane refusing to let go. As a result, they quarreled, and both sides delayed production. This phenomenon had long existed in the work area, but had not been resolved. The blackboard seized on this matter and wrote a critical article called "The Tale of Xu and Wang争车." After the criticism, Xu and Wang made self-criticisms, and everyone was educated. Since then, this phenomenon has not occurred again.

    The large blackboard newspaper, which comes out three times a week, is also a platform for the trade union to conduct propaganda and education for the workers in the entire workshop. In June of this year, in coordination with the factory-wide labor discipline education, they organized a cartoon exhibition in the workshop, praising good people and good deeds and criticizing bad phenomena that violated labor discipline, which achieved good results. The attendance rate in July reached 97.05%, higher than any July in previous years.

        The Family Affairs of Han Shusong
    Visiting the homes of employees in their spare time occupies a very important position in the trade union work of the foundry workshop. During the visits, they learn about the living conditions of the employees, help the families of the employees arrange their living plans, and many disputes that cannot be resolved in the workshop are resolved through visits. Comrade Xu Fanglong, for example, has served as a welfare committee member since 1952. For five full years, he has sacrificed his spare time, either going to the hospital to comfort patients or visiting door-to-door. He often braves rain and snow on Sundays to go to the countryside dozens of miles away from the factory to learn about the family life of the employees. On the way home from work or during the lunch break, he does not miss the opportunity to chat with the workers. He knows everything about the four to five hundred employees living in the workshop’s dormitories, who lives in which district, which house number, how many people are in the family, how many children are in school, how is their life, and whether the relationship between husband and wife and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is harmonious, etc.

    Han Shusong is a handyman in the workshop with a monthly salary of about 57 yuan. A family of seven relies on him alone to work, and life is quite tight. In addition, he does not know how to manage household affairs. As soon as he receives his salary, he goes to small restaurants to drink alcohol. After the money is used up, he applies to the trade union for subsidies. Comrade Liu Qingfa, a welfare committee member, visited his home four times in a row and helped them arrange a living plan, saving 12 yuan a month from drinking and smoking. At the same time, he mobilized his father to help them take care of the children and let his wife go to the streets to sell vegetables, which can earn 12 or 13 yuan a month. During the visit, Liu Qingfa found that his parents did not have a bed to sleep on, so the trade union bought a bamboo bed and mosquito net and sent it to them. Now, the life of Han Shusong's family has returned to normal, and he is no longer seen coming to the trade union for relief. Almost every life work committee member can cite a lot of similar examples, because they can solve the difficulties in life from a positive perspective, and the welfare subsidies paid by the trade union in the first half of this year have been reduced compared with the same period last year.

    It is hard to believe that so much trivial and meticulous work is done entirely in their spare time. Except for Chen Quandai, the chairman of the trade union, who is detached from production, the remaining 297 trade union workers all hold administrative positions or undertake heavy production tasks. Among them are workshop directors, foremen, team leaders, attendance clerks, dispatchers, accountants, labor models, and Party propagandists, etc. Every lunch break, they hold their lunch boxes and come to the trade union, either to attend a meeting or to chat with people and discuss work. They have never had the chance to take a nap, even in the hottest weather.

　　时刻跳动着的脉搏
　　本报记者　张竞
    走进戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂翻砂车间的工会，最引人注意的就是挂在墙上的那些五颜六色的锦旗和奖状。其中有一张用镜框装得很精致的奖状，是1956年被评为先进车间工会委员会的时候，由中国铁路工会上海区委员会发给的。
    两个半人中就有一个
    我好容易才找到车间工会主席陈全大。不巧得很，他正动身去北京参加全国工会积极分子代表会议。临行匆匆，他只能简单地告诉我：“做工会工作，没有什么秘诀，最要紧的还是依靠党的领导和大家的支持。在每星期党、工会和青年团的碰头会上，我们接受党的指示，并根据党的政治工作任务，安排工会的工作。否则，这么一个七百多人的车间，即使千手观音下凡也没有办法。”
    在与工会副主席刘清法同志的谈话中，知道这个车间工会除正副主席和十六个委员外，在十二个领工区和六十七个小组里，还有各种工作委员、小组长、干事等，一共二百九十八人（没有明确职务但热心帮助工会工作的还不算在内）。和全车间总人数相比，平均两个半人中就有一个做工会工作的。他们像一个机体的细胞，遍布在车间的各个部门和各个角落里，从组织几百人的劳动竞赛到排解夫妻纠纷，从车间到宿舍以至离厂几十里外的职工家庭，到处都有他们的踪迹。一个中年工人告诉我说：“一天二十四小时内，我们时刻都感到工会的脉搏在跳动”。
    还是六百多吨钢重要
    今年上半年，钢部接受了一批浇铸客车转向架的任务。本来计算，每炼一炉钢只能浇一只转向架，每天炼两炉，只能浇两只。但常常因为钢炉上加料等情况的变化，一炉钢水浇不完就浪费了。这时，钢部工人张银炎提出一个合理化建议，建议把炉底和炉壁加厚增高，使一炉钢可以同时浇两只转向架，每年可增产和节约六百六十吨钢。这个建议很快就得到行政上的支持。不料这个建议却遭到钢炉工人和浇胚、造型工段工人的反对。有人说：“这样做太麻烦了”，有人说：“这一改，把我们的计划都打乱了。”因此尽管行政上支持，但大家都不愿动手。怎么办呢？工会生产委员便召开了三个领工区的职工大会，给大家算了一笔账，说明在国家原材料供应困难的情况下，这个建议的价值和作用，然后便发动大家来讨论，究竟是愿意为国家多节约六百多吨钢呢？还是愿意个人少些麻烦？经过讨论，工人们都愿意执行这个建议。经过一个月的试验以后就推广实行了。
      “徐、王争车记”
    在生铁轮工区挂着两块小黑板报，看上去虽很简单，却吸引着整个工区的职工们。因为黑板报每天都换新的内容，所以有人称之为“工区日报”。在它的版面上，几乎每天都有人受到表扬或批评。凡是被它批评过的人，一般都能很快地纠正自己的缺点。例如化铁炉工房的屋顶漏雨了，雨水溅到铁水上，火星乱飞，而且影响铁水的质量。工人曾向领工员反映过好几次，可是领工员沉湎在每月完成指标的成绩里，没有理会这件事。不久，黑板报上就出现了一张漫画：领工员一手指着月月上升的指标箭头，摆出一副得意洋洋的样子，屋顶漏水他好像根本没有看见。这幅漫画登出的第二天，领工员就找人把屋漏补好了。
    有一次，工区发生了一件工人争用吊车的纠纷，两个人都强调自己的任务要紧，拉住吊车不肯放。结果竟争吵起来，双方都耽误了生产。这种现象，在工区早就存在，但一直没有解决。黑板报就抓住这件事，写了一篇“徐、王争车记”的批评稿。批评后，徐、王二人作了检讨，也教育了大家。从此以后，这种现象就不再发生了。
    每周三期的大黑板报，也是工会向全车间工人进行宣传教育的阵地。今年6月份，他们配合全厂性的劳动纪律教育，在车间里组织了一个漫画展览会，表扬了好人好事，也批评不遵守劳动纪律的坏现象，收到很好的效果，7月份出勤率达到了97.05％，比以往任何一年的7月份都高。
        韩树松的家务事
    利用业余时间访问职工家庭，在翻砂车间工会工作中占着很重的分量。他们在访问中，了解职工生活情况，帮助职工家属安排生活计划，许多无法在车间里解决的纠纷，通过访问都解决了。像徐方龙同志，从1952年担任生活委员以来，整整五年中，他牺牲了自己的业余时间，不是到医院去慰问病人，就是挨家挨户的串门子访问。他常常在星期天冒雨踏雪到离厂几十里外的乡下去，了解职工家庭生活，下班回家的路上或者中午休息时间，他也不放松机会和工人聊天。全车间住在工房四、五百职工，谁住在几区，几号门牌，家里几口人，有几个小孩读书，生活如何，夫妻婆媳之间是否和睦等等，他都了如指掌。
    韩树松是车间的杂工，每月工资约五十七元，一家七口靠他一个人劳动，生活是相当紧的，加上不会料理家务，一发工资就进小馆子喝酒，钱用完就向工会申请补助，生活委员刘清法同志接连到他家访问了四次，帮他们安排了一个生活计划，每月从喝酒、抽烟上省下来的钱就有十二元。同时又动员他父亲帮他们看孩子，让他老婆上街卖菜，每月可挣得十二、三元。在访问中，刘清法发现他父母亲没有床铺睡，便由工会买了一张竹床和帐子送去。现在，韩树松一家的生活已经正常起来，再也看不见他到工会来闹救济了。像这一类的例子，几乎每个生活工作委员都能举出一大堆来，因为他们能从积极方面解决生活困难，今年上半年工会付出的生活补助费比去年同期已经减少了。
    很难使人相信，这许多繁琐而又细致的工作，完全是利用业余时间来完成的。翻砂车间除工会主席陈全大脱产外，其余二百九十七个工会工作者都担负着行政职务或繁重的生产任务。他们中有车间主任、领工员、工长，有考勤员、调度员、会计，还有劳动模范、党的宣传员等等，每到中午休息时间，他们就捧着饭盒子到工会来，不是开会，就是找人聊天，商量工作。他们从来也没有空睡过午觉，即使最热天气，也没有例外。
