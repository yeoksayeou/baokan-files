    Talking about Rayon
    Wu Chunxi
    Editor's Note: The author of this article suggests that China develop its rayon industry to alleviate the shortage of cotton cloth. Some people have different views on this issue, arguing that China's timber resources are also insufficient. This is a question of the development direction of the textile industry, and we hope that more comrades will explore it together.

    (1)
    Last year, China suffered natural disasters on a large scale, and cotton production decreased, resulting in insufficient raw materials for textile factories. Therefore, the State Council made a decision to reduce the supply of cotton cloth.
    Under the current level of science and technology, we do not yet have the power to completely control nature and fundamentally eliminate natural disasters. This makes it impossible to fully guarantee the planned output of cotton and to fully guarantee the supply of raw cotton needed by textile factories. Therefore, the problem of insufficient cotton cloth supply, which is of great importance to people's lives, will be difficult to solve for a long time.
    The output of rayon is hardly affected by climate. If our country uses rayon as the raw material for fabrics in part or in large part in the future, the supply problem of fabrics can be solved more favorably.

    (2)
    The main raw materials for rayon are wood cellulose, sulfur, salt, and charcoal. China has large reserves of these four materials, especially the latter two. Increasing cotton production requires squeezing out some arable land for grain production; while cellulose, if combined with afforestation work, can be produced almost everywhere in China.
    Rayon has only been a commodity for mass production and consumption for more than twenty years. In 1955, the total world output of various fibers was 26.968 billion pounds, of which rayon was 2.721 billion pounds, accounting for 10%, equivalent to 15% of the total cotton production and equal to the output of wool.
    The economic benefits of using rayon as a raw material are mainly in the following aspects:
    It can supply a wide range of fabric types. The quality of the whole package of raw materials is uniform, without any impurities. The length, thickness, luster, crimp, and color of the fiber can be produced or changed according to people's requirements. Whether it is pure rayon fabric or fabric blended with rayon and other natural and synthetic fibers, it can create ever-changing varieties without increasing production costs.
    Because rayon has the above-mentioned variability, it can be processed and produced on all ordinary spinning machines for spinning natural fiber yarns without adding any new machinery and equipment, which can save a considerable amount of investment. At the same time, rayon is clean, with uniform stripes and neat arrangement, so the cleaning, carding, and other equipment and processes in general cotton mills can be saved and simplified, shortening the production process and naturally reducing costs.
    Less sizing is required for rayon yarn as warp than for the same amount of cotton yarn as warp, but the result of processing on the loom is better than or at least not worse than cotton yarn as warp. Before leaving the factory, rayon can be pre-impregnated with various pigments, and the rayon produced will have various different colors, called dyed rayon, which is light-resistant and does not fade when washed. In this way, the cost of rayon cloth products will naturally be relatively low.
    In terms of price, the price of rayon on the world market has only increased by about two times in the past eighteen years, while the prices of cotton and wool have increased by five or six times. A considerable part of the production cost of natural fibers is labor; due to high industrialization and continuous improvement of living standards, labor costs are of course also continuing to rise.
    As a result of the continuous increase in population, the need for fabrics increases accordingly. The possibility of increasing the unit yield per mu of cotton is ultimately limited, and even if the unit yield increases, the production cost will also increase. At present, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in China is only 33 catties. If we strive to increase it to more than 40 catties, we must make great efforts and spend a considerable amount of time. The expansion of cotton fields should first consider the need to prioritize increasing grain production. Even if the area of cotton fields is slightly increased, such as by finding some ways in cotton-suitable reclamation areas such as Xinjiang, the estimated number is small and definitely difficult to adapt to the increasing population and growing needs. The possibility of rapid and large-scale growth of other natural fibers such as wool, hemp, and silk is also small. Therefore, it is quite difficult to rely solely on cotton and other natural fibers, assuming that the weather is good every year, to fully meet the growing material needs of the people in the next few years. Moreover, the average annual increase of 15 million people in our country should also be taken into account, which further aggravates the seriousness of the clothing supply problem.

    (3)
    Based on the introduction and analysis of the above-mentioned situations, I suggest that the relevant government departments should vigorously build and develop rayon fiber production enterprises, especially rayon production enterprises, in the short term. We have abundant raw materials, sufficient labor force, and the selfless technical assistance of various socialist brother countries. Developing rayon production enterprises has sufficient objective conditions. However, at the current level of chemical industry, machinery industry, and technology in our country, it is too demanding and unrealistic to hope to build our own factories and produce rayon on a large scale quickly. In order to properly alleviate the difficulties in raw materials for the cotton textile industry and change the situation of insufficient operation, before China builds a rayon industry and can basically meet domestic needs, I believe that the Ministry of Textile Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Trade should seriously consider importing some rayon.

    (4)
    Over the years, China Silk Company and other units have imported a considerable amount of rayon yarn for weaving pure rayon fabrics and interweaves. In 1955, a considerable amount of rayon was also imported from Finland for cotton mills to use as raw materials for spinning rayon yarn. Therefore, our country is not very unfamiliar with this commodity.
    From the perspective of import cost, the cost of importing 42-count double-strand matte rayon yarn from Japan plus freight is about 40 pence per pound, while rayon is only about 21 pence. One pound of rayon can be processed and spun into one pound of rayon yarn, but the import cost is only half, which can save a lot of foreign exchange. If the same amount of foreign exchange for importing rayon yarn is used to import rayon, the quantity of imported goods can be doubled. In this way, importing more rayon can reduce the import of cotton. If a large amount of rayon is imported, it may be possible to allocate a portion of cotton or cotton cloth for export, creating more foreign exchange.
    Similarly, comparing imported cotton and rayon, even if Egyptian cotton is not used, but Pakistani or Syrian cotton similar to domestic short-fiber cotton is used, the latter's free-on-board price is about 27 pence per pound, and the import price of cotton is more than 42% higher than the import price of rayon. Moreover, as mentioned above, because the length of rayon staple can be artificially determined, its use value in certain aspects is higher than that of imported short-fiber cotton. Especially when used to blend with cotton (or other fibers), the strength and aesthetics are superior to pure cotton yarn, and it can meet the diversified needs of the people and create many new varieties and specifications. In fact, the rayon blended fabrics we import from Japan are quickly sold out.
    Finally, our textile industry may have the following concerns due to lack of experience in the use of rayon: What is the supply situation of foreign goods? Can we get frequent and large-scale purchases? What if technical difficulties arise in the application? What if people don't like to use rayon fabrics if they are supplied in large quantities?
    According to my understanding, the world output of rayon is more than that of rayon filament. We have imported a large amount of rayon filament over the years, and of course we are also confident in importing at least the same amount of rayon. Moreover, from the development trend, the growth rate of rayon production in various countries, whether in absolute quantity or relative proportion, is faster than that of rayon filament. In fact, the foreign businessmen we usually come into contact with and have trade relations with have repeatedly pointed out that although China is a world-renowned cotton-producing country, it is a waste of such valuable resources to use cotton as the raw material for most fabrics. Although their motivation for saying this is to promote the sale of rayon to us, this criticism should still be taken seriously. On the other hand, we have also imported cotton over the years. Cotton is an agricultural product, and the output and export volume of various producing countries are largely limited by the area of cultivated land, especially seriously affected by good or bad weather. The supply of rayon is not subject to these constraints, and the certainty of procurement is naturally greater.
    As for the technical difficulties that may arise, we believe that they are easy to solve. We can not only ask for assistance from experts from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European brother countries, because they not only have their own rayon fiber industry, but also import a large amount of rayon. At the same time, we can also learn from industrially advanced capitalist countries. In fact, all manufacturers from various countries who hope to do rayon business with our country have repeatedly expressed their willingness to send experts to China at their own expense to assist in solving the technical problems of using rayon. I think we may as well seriously learn useful things from them to enrich ourselves.
    Of course, our people may not like such relatively new fabrics. Our working people usually feel suspicious of artificial things and dare not rashly believe in their quality. But it should also be affirmed that consumption habits can be cultivated. In more than twenty years, the world output of rayon has rapidly increased to more than 2 billion pounds. This fact is the best proof that people's consumption habits are not difficult to change and cultivate. Even the shortcomings that everyone usually thinks of, such as rayon's poor tensile strength, elasticity, abrasion resistance, and easy wrinkling, can now be largely overcome and improved through advanced technology.

    谈谈人造棉
    吴春曦
    编者按：本文作者建议我国发展人造棉工业，以缓和棉布供应不足的情况。对这个问题，也有人有不同看法，理由是我国的木材资源也不够。这是一个纺织工业的发展方针问题，希望有更多的同志来共同探讨。
    （一）
    我国去年在较大范围内遭受了自然灾害，棉花减收，纺织工厂所需要的原料供应不足。因此，国务院曾采取了减少棉布供应的决定。
    在目前的科学技术水平下，我们还没有力量完全控制自然，根本消除自然灾害。这就无法充分保证按计划产量收获棉花，并充分保证纺织工厂所需原棉的供应。因而与人民生活发生重大关系的棉布供应不足的问题也就长期难以解决。
    人造棉的产量几乎不受气候影响。如果我国今后织物的原料一部或大部采用人造棉，织物的供应问题就可获得比较有利的解决。
    （二）
    人造棉的主要原料是木质纤维素、硫磺、盐和炭。这四种物资我国都有大量蕴藏，后面两种尤为丰富。增产棉花要相应地挤掉一些生产粮食的耕地；而纤维素，若与造林工作结合起来，几乎中国全境到处都可以生产。
    人造棉成为大量生产和消费的商品，只有二十多年的历史。1955年世界各种纤维的总产量有二百六十九亿六千八百万磅，其中人造棉有二十七亿二千一百万磅，占10％，相当于棉花总产量的15％，与羊毛的产量相等。
    使用人造棉作为原料，在经济上的好处主要有如下几个方面：
    它能够供应很广泛的织物类型，整包原料品质整齐划一，没有杂质渗杂。纤维的长短、粗细、光泽、卷缩和颜色等都可按照人们的要求生产或变更；无论是纯粹人造棉的织物或用人造棉和其他天然纤维及人造纤维混纺的织物，都可以创造千变万化的品种，却并不增加生产成本。
    因为人造棉具有上述的可变性，就可以在一切普通的纺制天然纤维纱线的纺纱机器上加工生产，不必另添机器设备，这就可以节省一笔为数可观的投资费用。同时，人造棉品质洁净，条纹均匀，排列整齐，所以一般棉纺厂中的清棉、梳棉等设备和工序都可以节省和简化，生产过程缩短成本自然减低。
    人造棉纱作经线时需要的浆料比同量的棉纱经线少，但在织机上加工，其结果反比棉纱经线好，至少不差。人造棉在出品前，可事先渗入各种颜料，制成的人造棉就获得各种不同的色彩，叫做染色人造棉，光射和洗濯不褪色。这样，对人造棉布成品来说，成本自然就比较低。
    从价格方面看，十八年来世界市场上人造棉价只涨了两倍左右，而棉花和羊毛则上涨了五六倍。天然纤维生产成本中有相当大的部分是劳动力；由于高度工业化和生活水平不断提高，劳动力成本当然也在继续上升。
    人口不断增加的结果，织物的需要相应增加。棉花的每亩单位产量增加的可能性究竟有限，而且单位产量即使增加，生产成本也要增加。目前我国皮棉每亩产量平均仅三十三市斤，如果争取增加到四十多市斤，就必须付出很大努力和相当长的时间。而棉田扩充，又应首先考虑到粮食优先增产的必要性，即使将棉田的面积稍稍增加，如在新疆等宜棉垦区想些办法，估计也为数不多，决难与日益增加的人口和日益增长的需要相适应。其他天然纤维如毛、麻、丝等，迅速大量增长的可能性也都不大。所以我们单靠从棉花等天然纤维打主意，就假定年年风调雨顺，在未来若干年内，要求完全适应人民不断增长的物质需要，还是相当困难的。而且还应将我国平均每年增加一千五百万的人口考虑进去，这就更加重了衣料供应问题的严重性。
    （三）
    从上述各种情况的介绍和分析，我建议政府有关部门应该在短期内大力建设和发展人造纤维生产企业，尤其是人造棉生产企业。我们有丰富的原材料，有充裕的劳动力，有各社会主义兄弟国家无私的技术援助，发展人造棉生产企业是具备充分的客观条件的。但在我国现在这样的化学工业、机械工业和技术水平上，希望很快自己建厂大规模生产人造棉，是要求过高，不切实际的。为了适当解除棉纺工业原料的困难和改变开工不足的情况，在我国建成人造棉工业并能基本满足国内需要之前，我认为纺织工业部和对外贸易部应该郑重考虑进口一些人造棉。
    （四）
    我国历年来曾由中国丝绸公司及其他单位进口相当数量的人造棉纱，用来织造纯人造棉布和交织品。1955年也曾从芬兰进口过相当数量的人造棉，供棉纺工厂做原料，纺制人造棉纱。所以，我国对于这种商品是并不十分生疏的。
    从进口成本看，进口日本货四十二支双股无光人造棉纱，成本加运费价每磅约四十便士左右，人造棉则仅二十一便士左右。一磅人造棉可以加工纺成一磅人造棉纱，进口成本却只要一半，可以节省大量外汇。若以同等数量进口人造棉纱的外汇来进口人造棉，则可增加进口商品数量一倍。这样，多进口人造棉，就可少进口棉花，如大量进口人造棉，便可能调剂出一部分棉花或棉布出口，创造较多外汇。
    同样，以进口棉花和人造棉做比较，即使不用埃及棉来比，而用类似国产短绒棉的巴基斯坦或叙利亚棉花来比，后者每磅离岸价约为二十七便士，棉花进口价就比人造棉进口价贵42％以上。何况，如上所述，因人造棉绒长度可以人为决定，某些方面的使用价值比进口的短绒棉要高一些。尤其是用来和棉花（或其他纤维）混纺，强度、美观等既较纯粹的棉纱优越，又可符合人民多样化的不同喜爱需要，创造出许多新品种，新规格。事实上，我们自日本进口的人造棉混纺织物就是很快销售一空的。
    最后，我们的纺织界由于对人造棉的使用缺乏经验，可能有下列几种顾虑：国外货源供应情况怎样？是不是经常和大量的采购得到？应用起来技术上发生困难怎么办？如果大量供应人造棉织物，人民不喜欢服用怎么办？
    根据笔者了解，人造棉的世界产量较人造丝为多，我们历年都曾进口大量的人造丝，当然也有把握进口至少是同样数量的人造棉。而且从发展趋势看，各国人造棉增产速度，无论是绝对数量或者相对比例，都比人造丝快。实际上，我们平常接触到的和我国有贸易关系的外国商人，曾经不是个别的屡次提出，我国固然是世界上著名的棉产国家，但绝大部分织物都用棉花做原料，确是一种对于如此宝贵物资的浪费。他们说这种话的动机虽然是向我们推销人造棉，但这种批评还是应该重视的。另一方面，我们历年也进口棉花，棉花是农产品，各生产国家的产量和输出量颇大程度上同样受到栽种耕地面积的限制，尤其受气候好坏的严重影响，人造棉的货源就没有这些约制，采购的把握自然大一些。
    至于技术上假定发生困难，我们认为易于解决。我们不但可以请求苏联和东欧各兄弟国家的专家协助，因为它们不仅有自己的人造纤维工业，也大量进口人造棉，同时，我们也可以向工业先进的资本主义国家学习。事实上，凡是希望跟我国做人造棉生意的各国厂商，都曾经纷纷表示愿意自费派遣专家来华协助解决使用人造棉的技术问题。我认为我们也不妨向他们认真的学习有益的东西，来丰富我们自己。
    当然，我国人民也许可能不喜欢这样比较新颖的织物。我们的劳动人民通常对于人造的玩意总觉得大可怀疑，不敢贸然相信它的品质。但是也应当肯定，消费习惯是可以培养的。二十多年间，人造棉的世界产量迅速增加到二十多亿磅，这个事实，是人民消费习惯不难改变和培养的最好证明。就是大家通常以为人造棉拉力、弹性较差，不大耐磨擦，和易绉等缺点，目前也大部可以通过先进的技术，加以克服和改进。
