Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 3rd: Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, told voters in the Mundok County electoral district of South Pyongan Province on August 2nd that one of the main tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, which began this year, is to solve the problems of clothing, food, and housing for the people. During this period, not only will the people's living standards be restored to pre-war levels, but they will also be further improved.

Kim Il-sung said that by the end of the first Five-Year Plan, North Korea would be able to produce 9.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 10 million tons of coal, 600,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, and 2 million tons of cement annually. Grain production should reach 3.7 million tons in order to completely solve the grain problem and have a surplus. The annual production of textiles should be enough to provide each person in North Korea with 17 meters. In addition, a large number of houses will be built.

According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kim Il-sung was speaking to voters in his electoral district as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly. He condemned the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique for unilaterally abolishing important provisions of the Armistice Agreement and shipping new weapons into South Korea. He said that they have actually embarked on the road to abolishing the Armistice Agreement, and they cannot escape responsibility for the serious consequences arising therefrom. He said that the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Republic have always advocated the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, and the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea on a democratic basis without foreign interference. To this end, the Armistice Agreement must be maintained, the armistice must be transformed into a solid peace, the military forces of North and South Korea should not be increased but should be reduced, the barriers between North and South Korea should be opened, and North and South Korea should make practical contact. He said that we must advocate the convening of an international conference of relevant countries to peacefully resolve the Korean question. He called on the people of North and South Korea to overcome all difficulties and continue to struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. He said that this struggle is long-term and arduous, but the Korean people will surely achieve victory.

Kim Il-sung said that in the nine years since the first election was held in 1948, the Supreme People's Assembly was elected, and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was established, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Party and the government, defeated the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism, defended the independence of the fatherland, and achieved great success in the post-war restoration and construction of the people's economy. If the Korean people had not established and consolidated the people's regime under the leadership of the Workers' Party, it would not have been possible to achieve such historic victories. He emphasized that in order to carry out the current historical tasks, the Korean people must further strengthen the people's regime.

Kim Il-sung called on all patriotic forces in North and South Korea to unite around the Workers' Party and the Government of the Republic and complete the cause of striving for national liberation and the complete independence of the fatherland. It is necessary to further strengthen friendship and unity with the people of socialist countries and to strengthen friendship and cooperation with the peace-loving people of the world and with the people of all countries striving for national independence.

He finally called on voters to unanimously participate in the election of the Supreme People's Assembly on August 27.

    金日成向选民谈朝鲜第一个五年计划
    号召为实现朝鲜和平统一而斗争
    新华社平壤3日电　金日成首相8月2日在平安南道文德郡选区对选民们说，从今年开始的第一个五年计划的主要任务之一是解决人民的衣、食、住问题。在这个期间，不仅要使人民生活恢复到战前水平，而且要有进一步的改善。
    金日成说，第一个五年计划结束时，朝鲜北部每年将能够生产九十五亿瓩时电力，一千万吨煤，六十万吨化学肥料，两百万吨水泥。粮食产量要达到三百七十万吨，以便完全能够解决粮食问题并有余粮。每年生产的纺织品要使朝鲜北部每人能分到十七公尺。另外要建设大量的住宅。
    据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，金日成是以最高人民会议代议员候选人的身份向他的选区的选民们讲话的。他谴责了美国和李承晚集团片面废除停战协定的重要条款、把新武器运进南朝鲜的行为。他说，他们实际上已经走上了废除停战协定的道路，他们不能逃避对由此产生的严重后果所负的责任。他说，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府一向主张和平统一祖国，一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，在没有外国干涉的情况下，在民主的基础上实现朝鲜的和平统一。为此，必须维护停战协定，把停战转变为巩固的和平，南北朝鲜的武力不应增加而应削减，应该打开南北朝鲜之间的障碍，南北朝鲜进行实际的接触。他说，我们必须主张召开有关国家的国际会议，以和平解决朝鲜问题。他号召南北朝鲜人民要克服一切困难，为实现祖国的和平统一而继续斗争。他说，这一斗争是长期的、艰苦的，但是朝鲜人民必将取得胜利。
    金日成说，自从1948年举行第一次选举，选出了最高人民会议，创建了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府以来的九年中，朝鲜人民在党和政府的领导下，打败了美帝国主义的武装侵略，保卫了祖国的独立，并且在战后的人民经济恢复建设中取得了巨大的成就。如果朝鲜人民没有在劳动党的领导下建立并且巩固了人民政权的话，是不可能取得这样的历史性的胜利的。他强调为了执行当前的历史任务，朝鲜人民必须进一步加强人民政权。
    金日成号召南北朝鲜的一切爱国力量要团结在劳动党和共和国政府的周围，完成争取民族解放和祖国的完全独立的事业。要进一步加强同社会主义各国人民的友谊团结，要同全世界爱好和平的人民，同争取民族独立的一切国家的人民加强友谊合作。
  他最后号召选民们一致参加8月27日的最高人民会议选举。
