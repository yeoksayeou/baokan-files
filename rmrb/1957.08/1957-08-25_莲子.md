　　Lotus Seeds
　　"Jianlian" Production Increases

　　The "Jianlian" (formerly known as "Tribute Lotus"), famous at home and abroad with a history of over 300 years, has achieved a bumper harvest. The total output is expected to reach 100,000 jin, an increase of about 100% compared to last year.

　　"Jianlian" is a specialty of Jianyang County, Fujian Province. Every year, from around "Qingming" to "Guyu," lotus farmers begin transplanting lotus roots. After more than three months of careful cultivation, harvesting generally begins at the end of July. This year, the planting area of "Jianlian" in the county increased by 70% compared to last year, and the quality of lotus seeds has also improved. For example, the Tongyou Agricultural Cooperative harvested "White Lotus" that was large and white. In the past, 600 seeds weighed one "jin," but this year, 520 seeds weigh one "jin." (Jinshan)
　　Binhu "Xianglian" Has a Good Harvest

　　Starting in late July, more than 7,000 mu of "Xianglian" around Dongting Lake began to be harvested. Lotus-picking boats shuttle back and forth on the lake like brocade weaving.

　　This year's "Xianglian" harvest is very good. The Fengshu Agricultural Cooperative in Huchengwan Township harvested 230 jin of dried lotus seeds on the first harvest from 200 mu of "Xianglian." It is estimated that this year's yield will be more than 3,400 jin of lotus seeds.

　　"Xianglian" is a specialty of Binhu, fragrant, sweet, and delicious, and sells well at home and abroad. After the dike burst in 1954, more than 40,000 mu of "Xianglian" in Hanshou were flooded. This year, the Hanshou County People's Committee invested more than 6,000 yuan to help agricultural cooperatives in seven lakeside townships expand the planting of "Xianglian" by more than 700 mu, restoring "Xianglian" production.

　　Lanxi White Lotus Increases Sixfold

　　In the vast fields of Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, lotus flowers are in full bloom and lotus pods are laden with seeds. Male and female members of the agricultural cooperatives are busy harvesting lotus seeds. According to relevant departments, this year's total output of Lanxi County lotus seeds is expected to reach 1.27 million jin, an increase of sixfold compared to last year.

　　Lanxi lotus seeds are also known as "White Lotus," and "Fu Lotus" is of the best quality, with large, plump seeds, thin skins, and white flesh.

　　Lotus seeds are a tonic and an important raw material for confectionery factories to make "Sugar Lotus Cores." At present, the Lanxi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative is actively organizing purchases. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, "This year, in addition to meeting the needs of the local people, Lanxi lotus seeds will export 100,000 jin and ship 700,000 jin to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places, a sevenfold increase compared to last year."

　　莲子
    “建莲”增产
    名闻国内外，具有三百多年历史的“建莲”（原称“贡莲”）获得丰收，总产量可达十万斤，比去年增产一倍左右。
    “建莲”是福建省建阳县的特产。每年自“清明”至“谷雨”前后，莲农们就开始取藕移植，经过三个多月的精心培植，7月底就可普遍开始采摘。今年该县“建莲”的种植面积比去年扩大了70％，莲子的质量也有提高，如童游农业社，今年采摘的“白莲”，粒大而白，过去六百粒才有一市斤，今年五百二十粒就有一市斤重。（金山）
　  滨湖“湘莲”好收成
    从7月下旬起，洞庭湖滨七千多亩“湘莲”开始采摘，采莲船像织锦似的在湖面上往来飞梭。
    今年“湘莲”收成很好。护城垸乡枫树农业社二百亩“湘莲”，第一次就采收了干子二百三十斤，预计今年可产莲子三千四百多斤。
    “湘莲”是滨湖特产，香甜味美，畅销国内外。1954年溃垸后，汉寿四万多亩“湘莲”被水淹死；今年，汉寿县人民委员会投资六千多元，帮助七个湖乡的农业社扩种了七百多亩“湘莲”，恢复了“湘莲”生产。（敏）
  　兰溪白莲增产六倍
    在浙江省兰溪县广阔的田野里，荷花盛开，莲蓬累累。各农业社的男女社员们正在忙碌地采摘莲子。今年兰溪县莲子，据有关部门了解，总产量可达一百二十七万斤，比去年增产六倍。
    兰溪莲子又名“白莲”，其中以“伏莲”品质最佳，粒大饱满，皮薄质白。
    莲子是一种滋补品，也是糖果厂制造“糖莲芯”的重要原料。目前，兰溪县供销社正在大量组织收购。据该社负责人说：“今年兰溪莲子除了满足当地人民的需要外，将出口十万斤和运销上海、杭州等地七十万斤，比去年增加七倍。”　（姜　韬）
