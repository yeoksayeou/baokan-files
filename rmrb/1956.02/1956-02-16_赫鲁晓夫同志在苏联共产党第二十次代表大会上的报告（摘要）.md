Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, gave the Central Committee's report to the Party's 20th Congress on February 14.

Speaking of the period from the 19th to the 20th Party Congress, Khrushchev said, "The work done by the Party and the importance of events at home and abroad during this period make it one of the most important periods in the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and in the Party's efforts to strengthen our country, build a communist society, and safeguard world peace."

The first part of the report concerned the Soviet Union's international environment. Khrushchev said, "The transcendence of socialism beyond the scope of one country and its transformation into a world system is the main characteristic of our era. Facts prove that capitalism does not have the power to stop this historically significant process on a global scale. The simultaneous existence of two opposing world economic systems, capitalism and socialism, developing according to different laws and in opposite directions, has become an indisputable fact."

The period between the 19th and 20th Party Congresses was marked by the tremendous development of the national economies of the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries. Khrushchev compared the growth rate of Soviet industrial production since 1929 with that of capitalist countries.

Statistics show that: in these 26 years, although the Soviet national economy suffered tremendous damage from the war, its industrial output has increased more than twentyfold; while the United States, enjoying unusually favorable conditions, only increased its output by a little more than one time. The industrial output of the entire capitalist world has increased by less than one time. The people's democratic countries have also greatly surpassed the capitalist countries in terms of industrial production growth rates. Now, the Soviet Union ranks second in the world in terms of total industrial output. The industrial base of the socialist system is being strengthened day by day.

Khrushchev pointed out: "The characteristics of the development of socialist countries are their complete political and economic independence... Socialist countries are providing selfless assistance to each other in economic development in the process of strengthening their fraternal cooperation."

The reporter then analyzed the situation in capitalist countries, pointing out that the economic development of the capitalist world is very uneven and has become more unstable. He said: Since the end of the war, the major capitalist country, the United States, has experienced three large-scale production reductions; a serious economic crisis began at the end of 1948, which was only stopped by the tense arms race caused by the Korean War.

In addition, most capitalist countries suffer from financial instability, agriculture in some countries is in crisis, and world trade in capitalist countries is stagnating. The general crisis of capitalism continues to deepen.

Khrushchev pointed out that in the capitalist world market, "the United States of America is losing the monopoly position it had achieved in the first few years after the war."

West Germany and Japan have reappeared in the capitalist world. The working class in capitalist countries is taking increasingly resolute actions on basic political issues.

The reporter then analyzed the development of international relations.

During this period, the international status of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries has been further consolidated, and their prestige and international connections have grown immeasurably. The international socialist camp has an increasing influence on the course of international events.

At the same time, reactionary militarist groups in certain countries have continued to pursue a "position of strength" policy during these years.

Khrushchev pointed out the tremendous growth of peaceful forces in recent years. Khrushchev said: "A vast peace zone, including peace-loving socialist and non-socialist countries in Europe and Asia, has emerged in the world. This vast area is inhabited by nearly 1.5 billion people, accounting for the majority of the global population."

Khrushchev said that the unity of the working class, its trade unions, and political parties is of particular importance in the struggle for peace.

"For the sake of the struggle for peace, it is necessary to find points of contact and, on this basis, lay the foundation for cooperation and eliminate mutual recrimination. In this regard, cooperation with those in the socialist movement whose views on the forms of transition to socialism are different from ours is equally possible and very necessary."

Khrushchev said that over the past 10 years, imperialism has been defeated in the East, "the centuries-old colonial pillars of the East are collapsing, and the people of all countries are increasingly bravely beginning to decide their own destiny." In the past 10 years, more than 1.2 billion people, or nearly half of the world's population, have been freed from colonial or semi-colonial dependence.

Khrushchev said, "People's China and the independent Republic of India have joined the ranks of major powers. We have personally witnessed the political and economic upsurge of the people of Southeast Asia and the Arab East. The people of Africa have begun to awaken. The national liberation movement is gaining increasing momentum in Brazil, Chile, and other Latin American countries. The complete abolition of the ugly colonial system has now been put on the agenda as one of the most acute and pressing issues."

Khrushchev said that the people of former colonies and semi-colonies who have gained political freedom can obtain "modern equipment from socialist countries" "without any political or military obligations" to build their independent national economies.

However, "a large part of the African continent and some countries in Asia, Central and South America are still in a colonial or semi-colonial state of dependence." Contradictions and competition between colonial countries for spheres of influence, sources of raw materials, and sales markets are growing.

Khrushchev said: "The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact are not only aggressive military and political blocs, but also tools for enslaving backward countries—a new form of exploitation of a colonial nature... The struggle of the people of the East against participation in blocs is a struggle for national independence."

Khrushchev then spoke of the Soviet Union's role in the struggle to consolidate peace and international security. He said: "The Soviet Union's peace initiatives have become one of the most important factors that have had a tremendous impact on international affairs. The support and joint action of all peace-loving countries have greatly contributed to the success of the Soviet Union's peace initiatives... The efforts of peace-loving countries and people have not been in vain. For the first time since the end of the war, international tensions have been eased to some extent."

Khrushchev continued: "The Soviet Union has made great efforts to bring the positions of the major powers closer. Now it is up to the United States, Britain, and France. Naturally, this does not mean that the Soviet Union will refuse to make further efforts to ease international tensions and strengthen peace." Khrushchev emphasized: "The same efforts and mutual concessions are absolutely indispensable in relations between major powers. Negotiation must become the only way to solve international problems." Khrushchev pointed out that as long as three basic issues are resolved, a foundation for lasting peace can be laid. These three issues are: "Achieving collective security in Europe, achieving collective security in Asia, and disarmament."

Khrushchev said that the establishment of solid and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, the two most powerful countries in the world, is of paramount importance for strengthening world peace. "We believe that if the well-known Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can become the basis of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, it will indeed be very important for all mankind, and the benefits to the American people will certainly be no less than the benefits to the Soviet people and the people of all other countries."

Referring to the Soviet Union's relations with Britain and France, the reporter said: "We hope, as in the past, to work hard to further improve our relations with Britain and France. As European countries, our three countries have many common interests, the most important of which is the common interest in preventing another war."

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union will continue to consistently strive to expand and strengthen friendship and cooperation with Eastern countries. "We also believe that Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan will realize that normal relations with the Soviet Union are in their best interests." Khrushchev also said that powerful social and political forces have undeniable means to prevent imperialists from launching wars, and to give aggressors a fatal blow and crush their adventurist plans, if they really attempt to launch wars."

Khrushchev spoke of the great significance of expanding affairs and cultural ties between countries for the further development of international relations.

Khrushchev discussed some basic issues in the current evolution of international affairs. He emphatically pointed out: "The Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems has always been and remains the general line of our foreign policy."

Khrushchev refuted the lies fabricated by enemies of peace that the Soviet Union intends to overthrow capitalism in other countries by "exporting" revolution.

He said: "We are convinced that the victory of communism is based on the fact that the socialist mode of production has decisive advantages over the capitalist mode of production... We have always believed and still believe that the establishment of a new social system in one country or another is the internal affair of the people of the country concerned."

Khrushchev pointed out that the principle of peaceful coexistence is receiving increasing recognition internationally because there is no other way out in the current situation.

Speaking of the question of whether another war is inevitable, Khrushchev said: "As long as capitalism still exists in the world, the reactionary forces representing the interests of monopoly capital will continue their activities towards military gambling and aggression, and may try to launch a war. However, war is not destined to be inevitable."

Khrushchev pointed out that due to drastic changes on the world stage, new prospects have also emerged regarding the transition of various countries and nations to socialism. "It is very likely that more forms of transition to socialism will appear. Moreover, the realization of these forms does not need to be linked to civil war in all cases. The question that arises is: Is it possible to transition to socialism through parliamentary means?" In many capitalist countries, the working class, uniting the working peasants, intellectuals, and all patriotic forces around it, is able to occupy a stable majority in parliament and turn parliament into a tool of the people's will, creating the conditions necessary to ensure basic social reforms.

Khrushchev concluded the international part of his report by outlining the Party's tasks in foreign policy. He said that it is necessary to "strive for the cause of peace and the security of the people of all countries, and for the establishment of trust between countries, so as to transform the easing of international tensions achieved so far into a stable peace."

Khrushchev spoke of the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, saying that this period is characterized by: "Steady growth in all sectors of social production, further strengthening of the Soviet social and political system, growth in the material well-being of the people, and comprehensive development of Soviet culture."

Khrushchev said, "Following the instructions of the great Lenin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always steadfastly striven to ensure the priority development of heavy industry. The Party will continue to adhere to this general principle very firmly and consistently in the future."

Khrushchev pointed out that during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Party achieved further rapid development in various industrial sectors. The Fifth Five-Year Plan in industry was completed ahead of schedule in 4 years and 4 months. In 1955, total industrial output increased by 85% compared to 1950, production of the means of production increased by 91%, and production of consumer goods increased by 76%. The production of metals, fuels, and electricity, as well as other important heavy industrial sectors, has greatly increased. The machine manufacturing industry has developed the most rapidly. The output of consumer goods has increased year by year.

Khrushchev continued: "In the economic competition with capitalism, our country, due to the superiority of the socialist economic system, has grown in production rate much faster than the most advanced capitalist countries. For example, during the past five years, the average annual increase rate of our industrial output was more than three times that of the United States and 3.8 times that of Britain."

The reporter said that in 1955, labor productivity in industry almost doubled the pre-war level. Two-thirds of the total increase in industrial production during the Fifth Five-Year Plan was due to the increase in labor productivity. During the same period, production costs were reduced by 23%.

The draft directives for the Sixth Five-Year Plan outline a large-scale plan for the development of various sectors of the national economy. The level of industrial production in 1960 will be approximately 65% higher than the level in 1955.

The reporter said that the material foundation of our industry, scientific achievements, and the improvement of the technical and cultural level of the working class are all factors that open up broad opportunities for accelerating technological progress. We must make unremitting efforts to improve equipment; we must create the most productive, economical, and reliable machines, and we must extensively promote the electrification, comprehensive mechanization, and automation of production processes.

Khrushchev continued, "Now that we have a strong heavy industry that is developed in all aspects, we can rapidly promote the production of both the means of production and consumer goods. It is enough to say just this: The output of consumer goods in 1960 will almost triple that of 1950. The Party is now making its best efforts, and will continue to make its best efforts in the future, to ensure that the needs of the Soviet people are more fully and more perfectly satisfied; the Party considers this its primary responsibility to the people."

Khrushchev pointed out the need to rely on the abundant natural resources in the eastern regions of the country, its coal reserves accounting for 75% of the country's total coal reserves, hydropower accounting for 80%, timber, important non-ferrous metals and rare metal reserves, and abundant resources of chemical raw materials, iron ore, and building materials each accounting for four-fifths. Experience has shown that producing coal and electricity in the eastern states is economically more advantageous than in the European part of the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev also said, "In the next 10 years, we must make Siberia an important coal and electricity production area in the Soviet Union, a center for industries that consume large amounts of fuel and power, especially the aluminum, magnesium, and titanium manufacturing industries, as well as electrometallurgy, coke by-products, and electrochemistry industries."

Khrushchev said that the current task is: In the next two or three five-year plans, to establish in Siberia the country's third largest metallurgical center with an annual output of 15 million to 20 million tons of pig iron. In the next 10 years, new and large machine manufacturing centers capable of manufacturing various machines, machinery, equipment, and instruments will also be established in the eastern states.

Agriculture occupied a large part of the Central Committee's report. The Party implemented a number of large-scale measures to develop this sector of the national economy. In 1954 and 1955, investment in agriculture reached 34.4 billion rubles. During these two years, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms received 404,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 228,000 trucks, 83,000 grain harvesting combines, and many other types of machines. In order to provide greater material impetus to collective farms and collective farmers to develop their collective economy and increase output sold on the market, the prices of grain, livestock products, potatoes, and other types of vegetables, flax, and hemp have been greatly increased. More than 120,000 agricultural specialists have been sent to collective farms. More than 20,000 Communist Party members sent from cities to the countryside have been recommended as chairmen of collective farms.

Due to the implementation of the measures formulated by the Party to further develop agriculture, it has been possible to take the first major step in increasing the production of grain and industrial crops. Last year, grain production increased by 22%, sunflower seeds increased by 95%, sugar beets increased by 54%, and flax fiber increased by 74%.

The development of virgin and fallow land is of particularly great importance for the continued development of agriculture. Estimates indicate that new fields can produce no less than 2 billion poods of grain annually on average.

Because virgin land produced a large amount of commodity wheat, the government can confidently expand the planting area of corn in Ukraine and the North Caucasus so that these areas can rapidly increase the production of meat and milk, as well as the production of industrial crops.

Khrushchev said: "Our main task in agriculture is to increase the total annual grain harvest to 11 billion poods by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan by increasing yield per unit area and developing more new land; to expand the planting area of industrial crops such as cotton, sugar beet, flax, hemp, and sunflower seeds and greatly increase their yield per unit area; and to greatly expand the production of potatoes and other vegetables."

The reporter pointed out that the problem of mechanizing the most important work in field operations has been solved. The Soviet Union is now facing the task of moving from the mechanization of individual tasks to the comprehensive mechanization of all agricultural production in the shortest possible time. Special attention should be paid to the electrification of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms.

Khrushchev then reported to the Congress on the improvement of the material and cultural level of the Soviet people. He pointed out that during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's national income—three-quarters of which was used to meet the personal needs of the people—increased by 68%. The real wages of factory workers, staff, and other workers increased by 39%, and the real income of collective farmers increased by 50%. In 5 years, the state spent 689 billion rubles on social insurance benefits, paid leave for factory workers, staff, and other staff, free and reduced-price holidays in holiday resorts and sanatoriums, and medical care for students.

Due to the improvement of the people's material well-being, the Soviet population has increased by 16.3 million people in the past five years.

The draft directives for the Sixth Five-Year Plan propose the task of increasing the real wages of factory workers, staff, and other staff by about 30% and increasing the income of collective farmers by at least 40%. It plans to increase the wages of low-wage workers. A decision has been made that during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, all factory workers, staff, and other staff will transition to working 7 hours a day, and young people between the ages of 16 and 18 will work 6 hours a day.

A system of 6-hour workdays will be implemented for factory workers, staff, and other staff on Saturdays and holiday eves, and a pension bill that makes important improvements to the pension system will be submitted to the Supreme Soviet for approval. Housing construction during the Sixth Five-Year Plan will almost more than double that of the previous 5 years. It is planned to build housing with a total area of approximately 205 million square meters with government funds.

Khrushchev then spoke of education, the work of universities and specialized schools, and the progress of science. He specifically mentioned that during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, more than 1.12 million specialists graduated from specialized schools and universities in the Soviet Union, which is 72% more than during the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

The reporter then spoke in detail about the further consolidation and development of the Soviet social and state system. He pointed out that the Communist Party tirelessly strives to strengthen and develop the fraternal friendship between all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. He cited figures to illustrate the economic development of various republics.

In 1955, the total industrial output of Kazakhstan increased to more than 33 times that of 1913; in the Republic of Georgia, it increased to 27 times; in the Kyrgyz Republic, it increased to 37 times; in the Armenian Republic, it increased to 41 times, etc. National intellectuals in various republics have developed. The general cultural level of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union has been greatly improved.

Khrushchev then analyzed the activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and systematically explained the tasks it faces. He listed the following figures: On February 1, 1956, the Party had 7,215,505 members and alternate members, including 6,795,896 members and 419,609 alternate members. This number is almost three times the number of Party members at the Eighteenth Congress, and increased by 333,000 people compared to the Nineteenth Congress.

Khrushchev said: "We have achieved great victories, but there have also been some failures, we have many things to celebrate, but there are also unpleasant things. However, the Party has not been overwhelmed by victory, nor has it been discouraged by failure. It still moves forward along the path it has chosen with courage and confidence." Khrushchev said that the enemies of socialism had hoped that the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin would cause chaos in the ranks of the Party, discord among its leaders, and hesitation in implementing its domestic and foreign policies. But their hopes were dashed. Khrushchev pointed out: "The Party's leadership core is not a group of people bound together by personal relationships or mutual interests: it is a working collective of leaders whose relationship is based on ideas and principles that allow neither mutual forgiveness nor personal animosity."

Khrushchev pointed out that the application of Leninist principles in Party matters has increased the political activity of Party organizations, strengthened their ties with the working people, increased their influence over the masses, and led to the further consolidation and growth of the Party.

Khrushchev demanded that all Party organizations tirelessly improve every aspect of Party work, especially to improve the level of Party organizational work and ideological work. The main work in Party organizational work is mass work—influencing the masses and encouraging them to complete the economic and political tasks stipulated by the Party.

Khrushchev concluded his report by saying: "The Soviet state is now advancing rapidly. Metaphorically speaking, we have climbed such a peak, reached such a height, that we can see before us the broad prospects that lead to our ultimate goal—a communist society."

Khrushchev said: "Our cause is invincible. It is invincible because hundreds of millions of people in fraternal People's China and in all other people's democratic countries are advancing this cause together with the great Soviet people. It is invincible because it is warmly supported and sympathized with by the people and countries of all countries who have freed from national and colonial oppression.

It is invincible because it is supported by the working people of the whole world. No one can intimidate us and force us to retreat from the positions we occupy, and make us give up the defense of peace, democracy, and socialism." (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 14, TASS) (Attached picture)

    赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上的报告（摘要）
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫2月14日向党的第二十次代表大会作了中央委员会的报告。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到第十九次到第二十次党代表大会这个时期的情况的时候说，“党所作的工作和这个时期内国内外所发生的事件的重要性，使这个时期成为苏联共产党历史上，以及党为加强我国的实力、建设共产主义社会和保障世界和平的努力中的重要时期之一”。
    报告的第一部分谈到苏联的国际环境。赫鲁晓夫说，“社会主义越出一个国家的范围和它的转变成为一个世界体系，是我们时代的主要特征。事实证明，资本主义没有力量来阻挡这个具有世界范围的历史意义的进程。按照不同的规律、朝着彼此相反的方向发展的资本主义和社会主义这两个对立的世界经济制度的同时存在，已经成为不可争辩的事实。”
    第十九次党代表大会和第二十次党代表大会之间的时期的标志就是苏联以及所有社会主义国家的国民经济的巨大发展。赫鲁晓夫把从1929年以来苏联工业产量增长率同资本主义国家工业产量增长率作了比较。
    统计数字表明：在这26年中，苏联的国民经济虽然遭到了战争的巨大破坏，它的工业产量还是增加到二十倍以上；而享有异常有利的条件的美国，产量只增加了一倍多一点。整个资本主义世界的工业产量增加不到一倍。各人民民主国家在工业生产增长率方面也大大超过了资本主义国家。现在，苏联在工业总产量方面占世界第二位。社会主义制度的工业基础正在日益加强。
    赫鲁晓夫指出：“社会主义国家发展的特点就是它们在政治上和经济上的完全独立性……社会主义国家在加强它们的兄弟合作的过程中正在经济发展方面互相给予无私的援助。”
    报告人接着分析了资本主义国家的状况，他指出资本主义世界的经济的发展非常不平衡，并且已经变得更加不稳定。他说：从战争结束以来，主要的资本主义国家美国在生产上经历过三次大量的缩减；在1948年年底开始了严重的经济危机，只是随后由于朝鲜战争所引起的紧张的军备竞赛而被止住了。
    此外，大多数资本主义国家的财政不稳定，一些国家的农业陷于危机，资本主义国家的世界贸易处在停滞的境地。资本主义的总危机继续加深。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在资本主义世界市场上“美利坚合众国正在丧失它在战后的最初几年里所取得的垄断地位”。
    西德和日本已经重新在资本主义世界出现了。资本主义国家的工人阶级在基本的政治问题上正在采取越来越坚决的行动。
    然后这位报告人分析了国际关系的发展进程。
    在这个时期内，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的国际地位进一步巩固了，它们的声望和国际联系不可估量地增长了。国际社会主义阵营对于国际事件的进程产生越来越大的影响。
    同时，某些国家的反动的军国主义集团在这些年代中继续执行“实力地位”政策。
    赫鲁晓夫指出了最近几年来和平力量的巨大增长。赫鲁晓夫说：“一个包括欧洲和亚洲爱好和平的社会主义国家和非社会主义国家在内的广大的和平地区已经在世界上出现了。这个地区的广大面积内居住着将近15亿人民，占全球人口的多数。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，工人阶级、它的工会和政党的团结在争取和平的斗争中有特别重大的意义。
    “为了争取和平的斗争的利益，有必要寻找接触点，并且在这些基础上，为合作打下基础，扫除互相责难。在这方面，同社会主义运动中那些对过渡到社会主义的形式的看法跟我们不一样的人士进行合作同样是可能的，而且是非常必要的。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，过去10年来，帝国主义在东方遭到了失败，“东方有几世纪之久的殖民主义支柱正在崩溃，而各国人民正在日益勇敢地开始自己决定自己的命运。”在过去10年中间，12亿以上的人民，即将近世界人口的一半，已经摆脱殖民地或者半殖民地的附属地位。
    赫鲁晓夫说，“人民中国和独立的印度共和国已经加入了大国的行列。我们亲眼看到东南亚和阿拉伯的东方的人民的政治和经济高潮。非洲人民已经开始觉醒。民族解放运动在巴西、智利和其他拉丁美洲国家的声势日益浩大。完全废除丑恶的殖民主义制度，现在已经被作为最尖锐和最迫切的问题之一提到议程上来了。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，已经得到了政治自由的以前的殖民地和半殖民地人民，能够“从社会主义国家”得到“不附有任何政治或者军事义务的”现代装备来建设他们的独立的国民经济。
    但是，“非洲大陆的很大一部分和亚洲、中美和南美的某些国家，仍然处在殖民地或者半殖民地的附属地位中。”殖民国家之间夺取势力范围、原料来源地和销售市场的矛盾和竞争正在增长。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约不仅是侵略性的军事和政治集团，而且是奴役落后国家的工具——一种殖民性质的新的剥削形式……。东方各国人民反对参加集团的斗争是一种争取民族独立的斗争。”
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到苏联在巩固和平和国际安全的斗争中的作用。他说：“苏联的和平倡议已经成为对国际事务产生了巨大影响的最重要的因素之一。一切爱好和平国家的支持和共同行动，大大促进了苏联的和平倡议的成功……。爱好和平的国家和人民的努力并没有白费。自从战争结束以来，国际紧张局势第一次得到了一定程度的缓和。”
    赫鲁晓夫继续说：“苏联已经作了很大努力使大国的立场接近。现在要看美国、英国和法国了。自然，这并不意味着苏联将拒绝作进一步的努力来和缓国际紧张局势和加强和平。”赫鲁晓夫着重指出：“同样的努力和互相让步是大国之间的关系中绝对不可少的。协商的办法必须成为解决国际问题的唯一办法。”赫鲁晓夫指出，只要三个基本问题得到解决，就能够为持久和平奠下基础，这三个问题就是：“实现欧洲的集体安全、实现亚洲的集体安全、裁减军备。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联和美国这两个世界上最强大的国家建立巩固的友好关系，对于加强世界和平具有极重大的意义。“我们认为，如果著名的和平共处的五项原则能够成为苏联和美国之间的关系的基础，对全体人类说来的确非常重要，并且对美国人民的益处当然也不下于对苏联人民和所有其他国家人民的益处。”
    报告人在提到苏联同英国和法国的关系的时候说：“我们同过去一样希望努力地进一步改善我们同英国和法国的关系。我们三国作为欧洲国家而言，有许多共同的利益，其中最主要的是在防止另一次战争方面的共同利益。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联将继续一贯地为扩大和加强同东方国家之间的友谊和合作而努力。“我们也相信，伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦将会认识到，同苏联之间的正常关系是符合它们的切身利益的。”赫鲁晓夫还说，强大的社会和政治力量具有不可忽视的手段足以防止帝国主义者发动战争，并且给侵略者以致命的打击和粉碎他们的冒险主义者的计划，如果他们真的企图发动战争的话。”
    赫鲁晓夫谈到了扩大各国间的事务和文化联系对于进一步发展国际关系的重大意义。
    赫鲁晓夫论述了目前国际事态演变中的一些基本问题。他着重地指出：“列宁主义关于不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则，一向是而且仍然是我国外交政策的总路线。”
    赫鲁晓夫驳斥了和平的敌人所捏造的关于苏联意图以“输出”革命的方法推翻其他国家的资本主义的谎言。
    他说：“我们确信共产主义胜利，是根据社会主义生产方式比资本主义生产方式具有决定性的优越性这样一个事实。……我们一向认为而且仍然认为：在一个国家或另一个国家建立新的社会制度，是有关国家的人民的内部事务。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出：和平共处的原则正在国际上受到越来越多的承认，因为在目前的情势下是没有别的出路的。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到另一次战争是不是不可避免的问题的时候说：“只要资本主义仍然存在在世界上，那末，代表着垄断资本的利益的反动势力就会继续进行他们走向军事赌博和侵略的活动，并可能试图发动战争。可是，战争并不是注定不可避免的。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，由于世界舞台上的剧烈改变，关于各个国家和民族向社会主义过渡这方面也出现了新的前景。“很可能将出现向社会主义过渡的更多的形式。此外，实现这些形式并不是在所有情况下都需要同内战连在一起的。产生的问题是：是否有可能通过议会手段过渡到社会主义”。在许多资本主义国家里，工人阶级把劳动农民、知识分子和一切爱国力量团结在它的周围，是能够在议会中占有稳定的多数，并且把议会变为人民意志的工具，创造为保证基本的社会改革所需要的条件的。
    赫鲁晓夫在他的报告的国际部分的结尾概述了党在外交政策方面的任务。他说，必须“为和平事业和各国人民的安全，为建立国与国之间的信任而努力，以便把到目前为止取得的国际紧张局势的缓和转变为稳定的和平”。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到苏联国内情况的时候说，这一段时期的特点是：“社会生产各部门都在稳步增长，苏维埃社会制度和政治制度在进一步加强，人民的物质福利在增长，苏联文化在全面发展。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，“遵照伟大的列宁的指示，苏联共产党一向坚定不移地为保证重工业的优先发展而努力。党在将来还将十分坚决地、始终如一地遵循这一总的方针。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在第五个五年计划期间，党实现了工业各部门的进一步迅速的发展。第五个五年计划在工业方面是在4年零4个月的时间内提前完成的。在1955年，工业总产量比1950年增加了85％，生产资料的生产增加了91％，消费品的生产增加了76％。金属、燃料和电力的生产以及其他重要重工业部门的产量大大增加了。机器制造工业发展得最迅速。消费品的产量年年都有增加。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说：“在同资本主义进行的经济竞赛中，我们的国家由于社会主义经济制度的优越性，在生产增长率方面，比最先进的资本主义国家不知要快多少。例如，在过去五年期间，我们的工业产量每年的平均增加率为美国的三倍多，为英国的三点八倍。”
    报告人说，在1955年，工业方面的劳动生产率几乎提高到战前水平的两倍。在第五个五年计划期间工业生产量增加的总数有三分之二是由于劳动生产率的提高。在同一个时期，生产成本降低了23％。
    第六个五年计划指示草案规划了一个发展国民经济各个部门的大规模计划。1960年的工业生产水平将比1955年的水平大约高65％。
    报告人说，我们工业的物质基础、科学上的成就和工人阶级技术和文化水平的提高，都是开辟加速技术进步的广泛机会的因素。必须坚持不懈地努力改进装备；必须创造出生产力最高、最经济和最可靠的机器，必须广泛地促进生产过程的电气化、全面机械化和自动化。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，“既然我们已经拥有在各个方面都很发展的强大的重工业，我们就能够迅速地促进生产资料和消费品的生产。只要说一下这么一点就够了：1960年的消费品的产量将几乎增加到1950年的三倍多。党现在正在尽它最大的努力，将来也将继续尽它最大的努力来保证更加充分地、更加完善地满足苏联人民的需要；党认为这是它对人民的首要责任。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出有必要依靠国家东部地区的丰富的自然资源，它的煤的蕴藏量占苏联全国煤蕴藏量的75％，水力占80％，木材、重要的有色金属和稀有金属的蕴藏量和丰富的化学原料、铁矿和建筑材料的资源各占五分之四。经验证明，在东部各州生产煤和电力在经济上比在苏联欧洲部分更为有利。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，“在今后10年中，我们必须使西伯利亚成为苏联的煤和电力的重要产区，消耗大量燃料和动力的工业，特别是铝、镁和钛制造工业以及电气冶金、焦碳副产品和电气化学工业的中心。”
    赫鲁晓夫说，目前的任务是：在今后两三个五年计划期间，在西伯利亚建立一个年产生铁1，500万吨到2，000万吨的全国第三个大的冶金中心。在今后10年中，还将在东部各州建立能够制造各种机器、机械、装置和仪器的新的和巨大的机器制造中心。
    农业在中央委员会的报告中占很大一部分。党为了发展国民经济的这一部门，执行了一些大规模的措施。在1954年和1955年，投入农业方面的资金达到344亿卢布。在这两年当中，集体农庄，机器拖拉机站和国营农场得到了404，000台拖拉机（每台以15匹马力计）、228，000辆载重卡车、83，000台谷物收获联合机和许多其他种类的机器。为了在物质上向集体农庄和集体农庄庄员提供更大的推动力，使他们发展他们的公有经济和增加在市场出售的产量，收购粮食、畜产品、马铃薯和其它种类的蔬菜、亚麻和大麻的价格已经大大提高。向集体农庄派了12万以上的农业专门人才。从城市派到乡间去的两万多个共产党员已经被推荐为集体农庄主席。
    由于实行党所制定的进一步发展农业的措施，已有可能在增加谷物和工业作物的生产方面迈进了第一大步。去年谷物生产增加了22％，向日葵籽增加了95％，甜菜增加了54％，亚麻纤维增加了74％。
    开发生荒地和熟荒地，对于继续发展农业具有特殊巨大的重要性。据估计表明，新的田地每年平均能够生产不下于20亿普特谷物。
    由于生荒地生产了大量商品小麦，政府可以充满信心地在乌克兰和北高加索大大扩充玉蜀黍的播种面积以便使这些地区急速提高肉类和牛奶的生产以及工业作物的生产。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“我们在农业方面的主要任务就是通过提高单位面积产量和开发更多的新的土地，在第六个五年计划结束时使每年谷物总收获量达到110亿普特；扩大棉花、甜菜、亚麻、大麻和向日葵籽等工业作物的播种面积并且大大增加它们的单位面积产量；以及大大扩大马铃薯和其他蔬菜的生产。”
    报告人指出，使田间操作中最重要的工作机械化的问题已经解决。苏联现在面对着这样的任务：在最短的时间内，从个别工作的机械化进入所有农业生产的全面机械化。对于集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的电气化应该特别注意。
    赫鲁晓夫然后向大会报告了苏联人民的物质和文化水平的提高。他指出，在第五个五年计划期间，苏联的国民收入——其中四分之三用来满足人民的个人需要——增加了68％。工厂工人、职员和其他工人的实际工资增加了39％，集体农民的实际收入增加了50％。5年中，国家在社会保险福利，工厂工人、职员和其他工作人员的工资照付的假期，免费和减费进的假日休养所和疗养中心以及给予学生的医疗等等方面用去6，890亿卢布。
    由于人民物质福利的增进，苏联人口在过去五年中增加了1，630万人。
    第六个五年计划指示草案提出了把工厂工人、职员以及其他工作人员的实际工资提高30％左右和把集体农民的收入至少提高40％的任务。它计划提高工资低的工人的工资。已经通过决定，在第六个五年计划期间，一切工厂工人、职员和其他工作人员都过渡到每天工作7小时，年在16岁和18岁之间的青年每天工作6小时。
      将开始实行工厂工人、职员和其他工作人员在星期六和假日的前夕工作6小时的制度，一个对养老金制度作重要改进的养老金法案将提交最高苏维埃批准。第六个五年计划期间的房屋建筑将比前5年差不多增加一倍以上。计划以政府资金建筑总面积大约20，500万平方公尺的住宅。
    赫鲁晓夫然后谈到教育，大学和专科学校的工作和科学的进步。他特别提到，在第五个五年计划期间，苏联的专科学校和大学有112万以上的专门人才毕业，这个数目比第四个五年计划期间多72％。
    报告人随后详细谈到了苏维埃社会和国家制度的进一步巩固和发展。他指出共产党不倦地为加强和发展苏联各族人民间的兄弟友谊而努力。他引证了数字来说明各加盟共和国的经济发展。
    在1955年，哈萨克的工业总产量增加到1913年的三十三倍以上；在格鲁吉亚共和国，增加到二十七倍；在吉尔吉斯共和国，增加到三十七倍；在亚美尼亚共和国增加到四十一倍等等。各加盟共和国中的民族知识分子已有发展。苏联各族人民的一般文化水平已经大大提高。
    赫鲁晓夫接着分析了苏联共产党的活动，并且系统地说明它所面临的任务。他列举了下列数字：在1956年2月1日，党有7，215，505个党员和候补党员，其中包括6，795，896个党员和419，609个候补党员。这个数目几乎为党在第十八次代表大会的时候的党员数目的三倍，比在第十九次代表大会的时候的党员数目增加了333，000人。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“我们已经获得巨大的胜利，但是也有一些失败，我们已经有许多可以庆幸的事情，但是也有令人不愉快的事情。可是党并没有被胜利冲昏头脑，也没有因为失败而沮丧。它仍旧满怀勇气和信心沿着它所选择的道路前进。”赫鲁晓夫说，社会主义的敌人曾希望约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的逝世会在党的队伍中引起混乱，在它的领袖中间引起不和，和造成在执行它的对内和对外政策时的犹豫不决。但是他们的希望落空了。赫鲁晓夫指出：“党的领导核心并不是靠私人关系或者相互利益而结合起来的一群人：它是领导人员的一个工作集体，他们之间的关系是以既不允许相互宽恕也不允许私人敌对的思想和原则为基础的。”
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在党的事务中运用列宁主义原则提高了党组织的政治积极性，加强了它们同劳动人民的联系，增加了它们对群众的影响，并且导致了党的进一步巩固和壮大。
    赫鲁晓夫要求一切党组织不倦地改进党的工作的每一个方面、尤其是提高党的组织工作和思想工作的水平。党的组织工作中的主要工作是群众工作——影响群众和鼓励他们完成党所规定的经济和政治任务。
    赫鲁晓夫在结束他的报告的时候说：“苏维埃国家现在正在迅速前进。用比喻的话来说，我们已经登上了这样的峰巅、登到了这样一个高度：我们已经能看到我们面前的导向我们的最终目标——共产主义社会——的广阔前景。”
    赫鲁晓夫说：“我们的事业是不可战胜的。它所以是不可战胜的，是因为在兄弟般的人民中国和在所有其他人民民主国家内有许多亿人民正在同伟大的苏联人民一道推进这种事业。它所以是不可战胜的，是因为它得到摆脱了民族和殖民压迫的各国人民和各个国家的热烈支持和同情。
    它所以是不可战胜的，是因为它得到全世界的劳动人民的支持。谁也不能威吓我们和强迫我们退出我们所占有的阵地，使我们放弃对和平、民主和社会主义的保卫。”　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯）（附图片）
