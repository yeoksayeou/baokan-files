How to Eliminate Rice Stem Borer in Seven Years
Yang Weiyi, President of Jiangxi Agricultural College

There are many agricultural pests. About 3,000 species have been identified in the country. Among them, locusts and rice stem borers are the most harmful. Locusts originated in the lower reaches of the Yellow River basin and in Xinjiang; rice stem borers are prevalent in provinces and regions south of the Yangtze River. Since ancient times, these two notorious pests have destroyed countless crops, caused numerous famines, and killed countless working people. Like floods and droughts, they are both widespread and frequent. If they are not eradicated, production is not guaranteed. If these two major insect plagues can be eliminated, the total loss from insect plagues nationwide can be reduced by more than half.

In the past, people were poisoned by superstition and generally believed that these pests were born of nature, "transformed by the southeast wind." They believed that insect plagues were natural disasters, the will of heaven, and that people could do nothing but pray to the Grasshopper Lord (locust god) and the White Sprout Lady (rice stem borer goddess) for protection. Moreover, under the rule of feudal classes and the reactionary government before liberation, who would care about the suffering of the people? They wouldn't care if pests ate people to death. The reason why the insect plague problem could not be solved for thousands of years lies here. After liberation, with a people's government, we wholeheartedly and realistically work for the people, develop agriculture, call for pest control, promote science, and break superstitions, so insect pests everywhere can be reduced year by year. In recent years, in the northern provinces, using airplanes to spray pesticides in large quantities has controlled locusts to the point where they will not cause disasters. In the future, combined with the Huai River control and the comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River projects, if the wasteland where locusts occur can be completely reclaimed and utilized, it will not be difficult to eradicate locusts forever.

Here I will focus on rice stem borers. Of course, there is absolutely a way to control and eliminate rice stem borers. There are about 100 kinds of pests on rice, and rice stem borers are the most serious. This is the biggest threat in the southern rice-growing areas, occurring every year, but the severity of the disaster varies from place to place. In the most severely affected areas, the rice seedlings grow well in the early stages, but later they are eaten clean, completely turning into dead heart seedlings or white ears, resulting in no harvest. Farmers sometimes feel so heartbroken that they jump and cry beside the fields when they see such a sight. Rice stem borers are small moths that can fly and like to fly to lights. After mating, the female moths lay eggs on the rice leaves, which hatch into small maggots called larvae. The larvae can burrow into the rice stems to harm them, then the larvae transform into pupae, and the pupae transform into adults, which are small moths, which then mate and lay eggs, endlessly cycling year after year. This four-stage transformation of eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults is called a generation. Each year, two, three, four, or five generations continue to be produced. Each female moth in each generation can reproduce hundreds of descendants, becoming more and more numerous, and by summer and autumn, they can become so numerous as to cause a disaster.

Although rice stem borers are serious, they also have their weaknesses, giving us the opportunity to kill them. They mainly feed on rice seedlings and overwinter concentrated in the rice roots, with only a few overwintering in weeds, rice stalks, or wild rice stems. Their overwintering time is very long, sleeping quietly in the rice roots, called hibernation, for about 100 to 200 days. During hibernation, they neither eat nor move, and have no resistance to external attacks. These weaknesses in their lives give us ample time and the most convenient conditions to kill them. As long as the rice roots left in the fields can be eliminated, rice stem borers cannot survive. If the overwintering rice stem borers can be killed, the rice stem borer disaster can be eliminated the following year. Now is the best time to kill them when rice stem borers are overwintering and sleeping soundly. We must not miss this good opportunity and should quickly and vigorously attack them. We must completely and thoroughly kill them to create favorable conditions for a bumper harvest this year. How to attack? Here are a few methods:

	I. To clear the overwintering "board fields" - Any fields that have not been planted with crops in autumn and winter and have not been cultivated are called "board fields" in some places. This kind of "board field" is extremely harmful. It can preserve a large number of pests and plant pathogens, as well as various weeds overwintering, and the soil is compacted and not easily weathered. Especially "board fields" that have been planted with one season of mid- or late-season rice or double-season late rice, the rice roots have not been turned over, and are arranged on the field surface, allowing rice stem borers and other pests to overwinter comfortably in such rice roots. In places that were severely affected by rice stem borers last year, the overwintering rice stem borers hidden in such fields now number as many as 70,000 to 80,000 per mu, and they will come out to breed when the weather warms up in spring. In order to eliminate rice stem borer disasters, all "board fields" must be deeply ploughed and finely harrowed. If the edges and corners of the fields cannot be ploughed, hoes must be used to dig up and turn over the rice roots. If the muddy fields are so muddy that people and cattle cannot go down to plough and harrow, they must be flooded for a long time. If there is no water source to flood them, the field gaps should be blocked to store rainwater. This work should preferably be completed before the Spring Festival. If it cannot be carried out due to the cold weather, it must be done before the local peach blossoms bloom or the frogs croak at the latest. This is the most important rice stem borer control technique and cannot be neglected.
	II. Pick up and destroy rice roots exposed on the soil surface - Fields that have been planted with winter crops have been ploughed and harrowed. In rainy and humid low-lying fields, the rice roots exposed on the soil surface are prone to rot, and the rice stem borers in them are also prone to rot and die. Only in high-lying fields that have been dry for a long time, the rice roots exposed on the soil surface and the rice stem borers in the rice roots are not easily rotted to death. It is best to pick up and burn all the rice roots, or put them into soil cellars to compost fertilizer.
	III. Handling rice stalks - In areas severely affected by the second-generation rice stem borer, the rice stalks after harvesting the grain should be used up as soon as possible. If they have not been used up when the peach blossoms bloom and the frogs croak, they should be rearranged so that the tips of the stalks face outwards and the roots face inwards. These insect-infested rice stalks should not be used to thatch huts.
	IV. Clear all weeds from the edges of the fields - Weeds are the overwintering hotels for various pests in the fields. About 500 kinds of pests usually live in the grass and sometimes migrate to crops to harm them. These can hibernate in the weeds in winter and still come out to breed the following year. A few second-generation rice stem borers can also overwinter in the weeds, so it can be seen that weeds and insect plagues are closely related. In winter, the weeds on the ridges of the fields, on the wastelands near the fields, and on the banks of ponds and ditches should be cleared completely and composted into fertilizer. This method can both kill insects and accumulate fertilizer, and is worthy of attention. The green grass on the edges of the fields in summer and autumn should also be cut frequently, as this also has the effect of killing insects and accumulating fertilizer.
	V. Cut off the remaining stems of overwintering wild rice - There is an aquatic plant that can be used as a vegetable called wild rice, also known as water bamboo shoots. The remaining stems of this plant in winter are very easy to hide second-generation rice stem borers and other pests. The withered stems and leaves above the ground should be cut off and burned.
	VI. Eliminate the rice roots in red clover fields - Red clover is a green manure that grows in winter and is widely planted in the south. Because this green manure has always been planted without plowing, the rice roots in the fields have not been eliminated, and many rice stem borers are hidden overwintering. Therefore, various methods must be used to remove the rice roots in this field, whether it is hoed or dug with a three-sided quick hoe, or pulled by hand, as long as the rice roots can be destroyed, any method can be used. The rice stem borer problem is really a rice root problem. In general fields, ploughing and harrowing can be used to destroy the rice roots; in red clover fields, because there are red clover seedlings, ploughing and harrowing cannot be carried out, so hoeing and hand pulling must be used to deal with the rice roots. The rice roots that are hoeed or pulled up must be picked up and piled up to burn into soil ash, or put into water cellars to compost into fertilizer. If it is not possible to do these things, the final solution is to not keep the red clover too old when it blooms, and plough it over before the full bloom period. If there is a water source, the field must be flooded.

If the above 6 methods can be done thoroughly, the overwintering rice stem borers can be basically killed, which is a fundamental method that does not cost much money.

In addition, there are many rice stem borer control methods in various places. As long as they can eliminate rice stem borer disasters, they can be promoted and applied. Now it is not that there is no way to control rice stem borers, but that there are ways that have not been well and widely promoted. If rice stem borer control techniques can be widely promoted, the rice stem borer disaster across the country can be eliminated within seven years. I hope that the broad masses of peasants in rice-producing areas and rural cadres will have confidence, be determined, and jointly fight against rice stem borer pests, and strive to increase rice production!

    怎样在七年内消灭螟灾
    江西农学院院长　杨惟义
    农业上的害虫很多，已经查出的，全国约有3，000种。其中要算蝗虫和螟虫为害最烈。蝗虫原产地是在黄河流域的下游各省和新疆境内；螟虫盛发于长江以南的各省区。这两类有名的害虫，自古以来，不知毁坏了多少庄稼，造成多少次数的大饥荒，害死了多少劳动人民。它们同水旱两灾一样，为害都很普遍而又时常发生。如果不把它们杀灭掉，生产太无保障。只要能消灭掉这两类大虫灾，全国虫灾的总损失，就可以减少一大半。
    以前在人们受到迷信的毒害，一般都认为这些害虫是天生的，“由东南风变成的”。认为虫灾是天灾，天意如此，除了请求蚂蚱老爷（蝗虫神）和白梢娘娘（螟虫神）保佑外，人是没有办法能对付的。并且在历代封建阶级和解放前的反动政府统治下，哪里会关心到人民的痛苦，害虫吃死了人，它也是不会去管的。数千年来，虫灾问题之所以老是不能解决，原因就在这里。解放以后，有了人民自己的政府，才会全心全意、实事求是的来替人民做事，发展农业，号召治虫，提倡科学，破除迷信，所以各处虫害能逐年减少。近年来在北方各省，使用飞机，大量喷药除治，已经控制到能使蝗虫不会成灾；将来再结合到治淮和根治黄河水患的工程，能把各处发生蝗虫的荒地，完全开垦利用，蝗灾是不难永远根绝的。
    这里专讲螟虫。螟虫当然也是绝对有办法可以除治的。水稻上的害虫，约有100来种，而螟虫最为厉害。这是南方水稻区域中顶大的威胁，年年都要发生，但是成灾的轻重，各地有所不同。受灾最重的，田里的禾苗，初期生长虽好，到了后来，会被它吃得精光，完全变成枯心苗或白穗，结果会颗粒无收。农民看到这样的光景，有时会伤心到在田旁蹦跳流泪。螟虫是会飞而又喜欢扑灯光的小蛾子，雌雄交配后，由雌蛾产卵在稻叶上，孵化出来，变为小蛆一样的东西，称为幼虫，幼虫能钻入稻茎中为害，再由幼虫变化为蛹，又由蛹而变为成虫，即是小蛾子，再行交配产卵，循环不已，年年如此。完成了卵、幼虫、蛹和成虫这样的四变，就称为一代。每年要继续产生二、三代或四、五代。每代的一个雌蛾，可以繁殖到百把个子孙，越来越多，到了夏秋间，就可以多到成灾。
    螟虫虽然厉害，但是它也有它的弱点，给我们有杀灭它的机会。它是以稻苗为主要食料、集中在稻根中过冬的，只有少数能在杂草里、禾稿里或茭白中过冬。它的过冬时间很长，在稻根里安静地睡觉，叫做冬眠，要睡100多天或200天左右。它在冬眠时间，既不会吃东西，又不会活动，对于外界的袭击，全无抵抗能力。这些生活上的弱点，给了我们有充足的时间和最便利的条件去杀灭它。只要能把田里所存留的稻根消灭掉，螟虫就无法生存。能杀灭掉过冬的螟虫，次年的螟灾就可以消除。现在正是螟虫过冬熟睡的时候，是杀灭它的最好机会。我们切不可失掉这个好机会，应当迅速地大力地向它进攻。要完全而彻底地去杀灭它，为今年大丰收创造有利的条件。如何进攻？下面有几个方法：
    一、要肃清过冬的板田——凡是秋季和冬季都不曾种植过作物而又不曾耕动过的田地，有的地方，称为板田。这种板田，害处顶大，能保藏大量的害虫和植物病菌以及各种杂草过冬，土壤板结又不易风化。尤其是曾经种过一季中晚稻或双季晚稻的板田，稻根未被翻动，排列在田面上，螟虫和其他害虫，都可以舒服地在这样的稻根中过冬。凡是去年曾受到螟害的地方，现在这样的田里所藏的过冬螟虫，每亩田中有的多到七、八万条，将来到了春暖，它就出来繁殖。为了消灭螟灾，必定要把所有的板田，深耕细耙。田边田角，如果不能耕到，也要用锄去把稻根挖动翻转。如遇人牛不能下去耕耙的陷泥田，就必须长期灌满水来。若无水源可灌，就把田缺堵塞，以便天雨蓄水。这些工作，最好要在春节前完成。万一因为天冷，而不能进行，最迟也要争取在当地的桃花开或青蛙叫以前，做好这些工作。这是顶要紧的治螟技术，疏忽不得。
    二、拾毁露出土面的稻根——种了冬季作物的田土，是经过耕耙的。如在多雨而潮湿的低田，露出土面的稻根，易于霉烂，其中螟虫也易霉烂而死。只是在长久缺雨而很干燥的高田，其中露出土面的稻根和稻根里的螟虫，都不容易霉烂死绝。最好要把这种稻根捡光、烧光，或把它投入土窖中，沤制肥料。
    三、禾稿的处理——凡是二化螟为害严重的地区，打去了谷子的禾稿，要尽先用完。到了桃花开，青蛙叫的时候，如果还没有用掉，就应当把它改变堆置，禾梢向外，禾根向内。这种有虫的禾稿，不能用来盖茅屋。
    四、铲尽田边的杂草——杂草是田间各种害虫的过冬旅馆。约有500多种害虫，平时出没在草中，有时也会迁移到庄稼中去为害。这些冬季可寄宿在杂草里，次年仍出来繁殖；有少数二化螟，也能在杂草中过冬，可见杂草和虫灾是有很大关系的。应该在冬季，把田埂上和田地附近的荒地上以及池塘边和水沟旁的草类，铲得精光，堆制肥料。这种办法，既可杀虫，又能积肥，值得注意。夏秋间田边的青草，也应该时常去铲割，这同样有杀虫和积肥的功效。
    五、割除过冬茭白的残株——有一种可作蔬菜用的水生植物叫做茭白，或称茭笋，也有叫做禾烧的。这种植物的过冬残株，顶易躲藏二化螟和其他害虫，应该把它的枯茎败叶，从地面以上的部分，都一起割来烧了去。
    六、消灭红花田里的稻根——红花草是一种冬季生长的绿肥，南方各处普遍种植。因为这种绿肥，向来是不耕而种的，田里的稻根，没有消灭掉，就潜藏了很多螟虫过冬。因此，必须应用各种方法来去掉这种田里的稻根，或用锄去铲也好，或用三面快铲去挖也好，或用手拔也好，只要能毁掉稻根，用什么方法都行。螟灾问题，实在就是稻根问题，一般田里，可用耕耙的方法来毁坏稻根；红花田里，因为有红花草苗，不能进行耕耙，那就不得不用锄铲和手拔的方法来处理稻根。所铲起来或拔起来的稻根，都要捡光，把它堆积起来，烧制土灰，或是放入水窖中去沤成肥料。万一不能照这些方法去做，最后的办法，只有在红花草开花的时候，不要蓄得太老，在盛花期以前，就可耕翻。如有水源，必须灌水浸田。
    以上6种方法，如能彻底做好，就可以把基本上过冬的螟虫杀掉，这是不花什么经费的根本办法。
    此外，各地的治螟方法还多，只要能消灭螟灾，都可推广应用。现在治螟不是没有办法，而是有了办法没有很好地普遍地推广。能把治虫技术普遍推广，七年之内当可消灭全国的螟灾。希望水稻产区广大农民群众和农村工作干部，要有信心，下定决心，共同来跟螟害作斗争，为提高水稻产量而奋斗！
