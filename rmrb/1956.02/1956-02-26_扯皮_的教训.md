Lessons from "Buck-Passing"

Editor's Note: In order to educate some of its subordinate units and staff to prevent and correct the errors of departmentalism, the Ministry of Heavy Industry revealed some past incidents of "buck-passing" among its subordinate units. Although these are all past events that have been resolved and dealt with, they still have realistic and universal educational significance today. What is published here is an excerpt of some of these incidents.

More than 70,000 Tons of Steel Lost

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant, throughout 1954 and the first quarter of 1955, only focused on unilaterally completing its own production plan. It violated production discipline for a long time and did not supply high-quality molten iron to the Steel Smelting Plant according to technical standards. As a result, the Steel Smelting Plant was forced to extend steelmaking time, reduce steel quality, and reduce steel production. From July 1954 to March 1955 alone, it is estimated that steel production was reduced by more than 77,500 tons.

Delayed for 11 Months

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Chemical Plant originally planned to expand the refined benzene workshop in 1954. Just as construction was about to begin, the production unit, based on the one-sided view of production safety, put forward more than 100 "commandments" to restrict the operation of the construction unit. The construction unit also did not actively consult with the other party to overcome difficulties. Later, this project had to be cut from the annual plan. In early 1955, the construction unit proposed building a partition wall to prevent refined benzene explosion accidents to ensure the progress of construction. This proposal was correct, and the partition wall could be completed in just 3 days. However, because of questions such as "who should do it," "who should pay for it," and "how much to pay," they repeatedly argued with the production unit and shirked responsibility, delaying the expansion project of the workshop for 11 months and causing serious idleness.

Heating Furnace Not Put into Production on Time

In August 1954, the Ministry of Heavy Industry approved the addition of a heating furnace to a certain steel rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. However, after receiving the design task, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute did not actively balance it according to the actual production situation before starting the design. Instead, based on its own subjective requirements and some theoretical calculations, it believed that the existing two heating furnaces could already meet the production requirements of the rolling mill and disagreed with adding a heating furnace. They spent a lot of time conducting various calculations and writing reports for defense, and put aside the design task stipulated by the state. It was not until April 1955, when the Ministry of Heavy Industry unified the understanding of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Design Institute, that the Design Institute agreed to carry out the design. However, during the design process, the Design Institute made many plan comparisons and was entangled in whether it was more appropriate to add another heating furnace or to extend the existing two heating furnaces, which delayed the design for 5 months. It was not until November 1955 that the drawings were issued. As a result, this project had to be cut from the 1955 plan, delaying the date of putting this heating furnace into production by half a year.

For Two Tons of Test Oil

A material tank hoist of a blast furnace in Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been completed and can be put into production after a test run. Two tons of test oil are required for the test run. The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company submitted the oil consumption plan to the Iron Smelting Plant a month ago, stipulating that the oil should be collected for the test run on June 6. However, when the oil was collected on the due date, it was found that the oil consumption plan was still backlogged in the Iron Smelting Plant. After repeated urging, the Iron Smelting Plant submitted the oil consumption plan to the company. The deputy manager of the company responsible for the work of Party A checked that there were more than 20 tons of spare oil in stock and approved the oil consumption plan. However, the company's supply department emphasized that "the oil in stock is specially reserved for large rolling mills and seamless steel pipe plants" and refused to allocate it, so that the completed material tank hoist could not be tested on schedule. From June 6 to June 11, it could not be resolved. Finally, the manager of the construction company had to personally go to the manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company for consultation before the problem was solved. However, the test run date of the material tank hoist was delayed by a full 6 days!

No One is Responsible

The circulating water pump station project of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 7 blast furnace should have been coordinated with the production of No. 7 blast furnace. However, there are two high-voltage cables underground at the construction site that need to be moved out. Who is responsible for this migration work? Anshan Iron and Steel Company's power station and the electrical installation company shirked responsibility to each other and argued endlessly, delaying it for three or four months. As a result, the construction period of this project was delayed by almost more than a year. This project should have been coordinated with No. 7 blast furnace, but it was completed when another blast furnace was in production.

Buck-Passing for a Month and a Half to Check Data

A ventilator needed for a refractory project has arrived. However, it was found that the equipment data did not match the equipment, and it must be measured and checked. Who will do this work? Party A said that Party B should do it, Party B said that Party A should do it, and they pushed each other back and forth, and no one wanted to do it. From March 17 to early May, Party B finally agreed. But Party B was afraid of taking responsibility, so he only agreed to measure but refused to sign. So after the work was done, the two parties continued to buck-pass for a signature. In this way, the foundation drawing of the ventilator, which should have been delivered in mid-April, was not sent out until May 24.

Nine Meetings to Move Two Tanks

There are two large tanks on the construction site of the new tar crystallization workshop project, which must be moved away by the Chemical Plant before construction can begin. However, the Chemical Plant did not consider the construction unit and repeatedly emphasized objective difficulties, either saying that there was no one or that there was no place. After several meetings, the Chemical Plant always refused to implement the resolution. It dragged on from June to August, and after nine meetings, the company ordered the relocation within a time limit, and the Chemical Plant had to relocate. Departmentalism has thus unnecessarily postponed the tar crystallization workshop project for three months.

### “扯皮”的教训

    “扯皮”的教训
    编者按　重工业部为了教育所属的某些单位和某些工作人员防止和纠正本位主义的错误，揭发了过去该部所属各单位之间互相“扯皮”的一些事例。这些虽然都是过去的和已经解决、处理了的事了，但是在今天仍然有着现实的、普遍的教育意义。这里发表的是其中一部分事例的摘录。
    少产7万多吨钢
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂，在1954年一整年和1955年第一季度，只顾片面地完成本厂的产量计划，长期地违反生产纪律，不按照技术标准给炼钢厂供应优质的铁水，以致炼钢厂被迫延长炼钢时间，降低钢的质量，减少钢的产量，仅1954年7月到1955年3月，估计共减产钢约77，500多吨。
    拖延了11个月
    鞍钢化工厂原计划在1954年进行精苯车间的扩建工程，就要施工了，生产单位从片面考虑生产安全的观点出发，提出100多条“戒律”来限制施工单位的作业，而施工单位也不主动地积极地同对方商量克服困难，后来只好把这一个工程从当年计划中削掉。到了1955年初，施工单位提出筑一个隔墙来防止精苯爆炸事故，以保证施工的进行。这个提议是正确的，只要3天就可以把隔墙作好。但是又因为“归谁干”、“谁出钱”、“出多少”这些问题，同生产单位反复争论，互相推诿，使车间的扩建工程拖延了11个月，并且造成了严重的窝工情况。
    加热炉没有按时投入生产
    1954年8月，重工业部批准了鞍钢某轧钢厂增加一座加热炉。但是，黑色冶金设计院在接到这项设计任务书后，不是积极地根据实际生产情况加以平衡后就开始设计，而是根据自己的主观要求和一些理论上的计算，认为现有两座加热炉已经可以满足轧钢机生产要求，不同意增加加热炉。他们把许多时间花费在进行各种计算和写报告辩护上，而把国家规定的设计任务搁在一旁。直到1955年4月重工业部统一了鞍钢和设计院的认识，设计院才同意进行设计。但是，在设计过程中，设计院又作了许多方案比较，纠缠于多增加一座加热炉合适还是延长现有的两座加热炉合适，使这项设计拖后了5个月，直到1955年11月才发图。结果不得不在1955年的计划中削掉这项工程，使这座加热炉投入生产的日期拖后了半年。
    为了两吨试车油
    鞍钢有一座高炉的料罐卷扬机已经完工，经过试车就可以投入生产。试车的时候，需要两吨试车油。鞍山钢铁建设公司早一个月就将用油计划报送炼铁厂，规定在6月6日领油试车。但是，到期去领油的时候，发现用油计划还积压在炼铁厂。经再三催促，炼铁厂才把用油计划报送公司。公司负责甲方工作的副经理查明了库存备品油还有20多吨之后，就批准了这个用油计划。但是公司供应部门强调“库存的油是专为大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂备用的”而拒绝拨付，使得完工了的料罐卷扬机不能按期试车。从6月6日拖到11日，还得不到解决。最后建设公司的经理不得不亲自去找鞍钢的经理进行协商，才算解决了问题。但是料罐卷扬机的试车日期已经整整拖迟了6天！
    谁也不负责
    鞍钢七号高炉循环水泵站工程，本来应该配合七号高炉生产。但是，施工现场地下有两条高压电缆需要迁出。谁来负责这项迁移工作呢？鞍钢发电站同电装公司互相推诿，争执不休，整整拖了三、四个月。结果影响这项工程的工期几乎推迟了一年以上。这项工程应该配合七号高炉的，结果到另一座高炉生产的时候才竣工。
  为核对资料，扯皮一个半月
    有一项耐火工程需要的通风机到货了。但是，发现设备资料同设备不符，必须实测核对。谁做这个工作呢？甲方说应当乙方做，乙方说应当甲方做，推来推去，谁也不愿做。从3月17日一直推到5月上旬，乙方总算答应了。但是乙方又怕负责任，只同意测而不肯签字。于是双方在工作做完之后，为了签一个字再继续扯皮。就这样把4月中旬应当交付的通风机基础图，拖到5月24日才开始发出。
    迁两个罐也要开九次会
    新建焦油结晶车间工程的工地上有两个大罐，必须由化工总厂迁走之后，才能动手施工。可是化工总厂不为施工单位着想，一再强调客观困难，不是说没有人，就是说没有地方。开了几次会，化工总厂始终不执行决议。一直从6月拖到8月，开了九次会议，公司下令限期迁走，化工总厂才不得不迁。本位主义就是这样地把焦油结晶车间工程无端推后了三个月。
