    Shanghai Chemists Gather to Present Academic Papers

    The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Chemical Society held its member meeting on the 4th and 5th. Chemists presented more than 50 academic papers at the meeting. Papers by renowned organic chemist Huang Minglong and others on steroid compounds explored the structure of many new hormones and their relationship with human physiology. These papers are of great significance to modern medicine. In the papers by chemist Zhang Qikai and others on the research of drugs for treating schistosomiasis, they introduced several new drugs for treating schistosomiasis that they successfully trial-produced using chemical synthesis methods.

    The papers presented also put forward the latest achievements in physical chemistry, polymer chemistry, and analytical chemistry research. Two important instruments for chemical analysis newly designed by chemist Qian Renzhi and others—the differential refractometer and the continuous indicating differential colorimeter—are both research tools with very high precision.

    The conference also invited Soviet expert Medvedev to give a report on "The Structure of Glass." (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海化学家集会宣读学术论文
    中国化学会上海分会在4日、5日举行会员大会。化学家们在会上宣读了50多篇学术论文。著名有机化学家黄鸣龙等人的关于甾类化合物方面的论文，探讨了许多新激素（荷尔蒙）的结构及其同人体生理的关系，这些论文对现代医学有重要意义。化学家张其楷等人关于治疗血吸虫病药物研究方面的论文中，介绍了他们用化学合成方法试制成功的若干种新的治疗血吸虫病的药品。
    宣读的论文中还提出了物理化学、高分子化学和分析化学研究方面的最新成就。化学家钱人之等人新设计的两种用于进行化学分析的重要仪器——示差折光仪和连续指示式示差比色计，都是精密度非常高的研究工具。
    大会还邀请苏联专家米德维捷夫作了“玻璃的结构”的报告。（新华社）
