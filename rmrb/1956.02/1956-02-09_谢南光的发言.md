    Xie Nanguang's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou's political report and the reports of the various leaders. Chairman Zhou pointed out a bright road for our suffering compatriots who are still under the bloody rule of the US-Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and for the Kuomintang military and government personnel who have fled to Taiwan and overseas. He represented the Chinese people and the Chinese government in announcing the motherland's broad-minded, compassionate, and boundless policy, which deeply moved me. As a native of Taiwan Province, I must stand up and express my heartfelt gratitude to the great leader of the motherland, Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, the government of the motherland, and the people of the whole country. I believe that the feelings of more than 8 million Taiwanese compatriots are the same as mine. Unfortunately, they do not have the opportunity to express their loyalty to the motherland. I believe that once they have the opportunity in the future, they will definitely repay the motherland's love for them with their patriotic actions.
    Now I would like to use this platform to say a few words to the Taiwanese compatriots in Taiwan and overseas.
    First of all, we must unite together and strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Now Chiang Kai-shek is still creating divisions in Taiwan, pitting mainlanders against native Taiwanese. We must recognize that our main enemy is the American aggressor. The US imperialists' ambition to invade Taiwan has been long-standing. In 1867, they sent their fleet to attack Taiwan, but were repelled by our heroic Taiwanese people. In 1874, they aided Japan in attacking Taiwan; In 1895, during the Sino-Japanese War, they again aided Japan in oppressing the Qing Dynasty to cede Taiwan. After Japan surrendered, the American aggressors, under the pretext of aiding Chiang, directly occupied Taiwan by force, attempting to use Taiwan as a springboard to invade our motherland. The reason why Taiwan cannot be liberated today is because of US imperialist aggression.
    The motherland has always pursued a peaceful policy, advocating the resolution of international disputes through peaceful consultation. The US imperialists attempt to use delaying tactics in negotiations to achieve the goal of long-term occupation of Taiwan, and use the threat of war to prevent our country from liberating Taiwan. But we cannot indefinitely tolerate the US delaying negotiations. We want peace, but we are not afraid of the threat of war. In any case, the motherland must liberate Taiwan.
    Chairman Zhou called on us, "Taiwanese compatriots and all personnel who have fled from the mainland to Taiwan, stand on the banner of patriotism, and together with the people of the motherland, strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the complete reunification of the motherland!" We fully support this great call!
    Secondly, I want to say that the liberation of Taiwan is not only the responsibility of the motherland, but also the responsibility of the Taiwanese compatriots. In this great liberation struggle, we are not powerless. We must recognize our strength. The United States wants to use Chinese to fight Chinese in order to achieve its goal of invading our country. We must shatter this conspiracy, and we have the ability to shatter it.
    Finally, I would like to talk about how Taiwanese compatriots can contribute to the glorious task of striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. We have the strength. I think we can do this. The people of the whole province must unite together. For the Kuomintang military and government personnel, as long as they can repent, as long as they are patriotic and willing to take the road of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, the Taiwanese compatriots should take the initiative to unite them, no longer distinguishing between native Taiwanese and mainlanders, no longer pursuing the past. All patriotic people must unite together and demand that the Taiwan local authorities take the road of peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Of course, we must anticipate that we will face various difficulties and cruel persecution. But we must overcome all difficulties to complete the glorious task. When we face difficulties, we should remember that "the motherland's unparalleled strength and boundless love are always supporting us." We are not isolated and helpless. The motherland must liberate Taiwan. Taiwanese compatriots, unite and persevere in the struggle!
    Chairman Mao told us, "In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed throughout the country." The happy life of the people of the motherland today is the bright future of the Taiwanese compatriots tomorrow. Taiwanese compatriots will definitely return to the embrace of the motherland, our future is bright, let us all work hard and strive!

    主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周主席的政治报告和各位首长的报告。周主席对于现在仍在遭受着美蒋反动集团血腥统治的苦难同胞，对于逃亡在台湾和海外的国民党军政人员，指出了一条光明大路。他代表中国人民和中国政府宣布了祖国宽宏大度慈爱无边的政策，使我受着极大的感动。我作为一个台湾省出身的人民，不得不起来向祖国伟大的领袖毛主席、共产党、祖国政府和全国人民，表示我衷心的感谢。我想800多万台湾同胞的心情也是同我一样的。可惜的是，他们没有机会来向祖国表达他们对祖国的忠诚。我相信，将来一旦有机会他们一定会用他们的爱国行动来报答祖国对他们的恩爱。
    现在我想利用这个讲台来向在台湾岛内和海外的台湾省同胞说几句话。
    首先，我们要团结在一起，为和平解放台湾而奋斗。现在蒋介石仍在台湾制造分裂，使外省人与本省人对立。我们要认清我们的主要敌人是美国侵略者。美帝侵略台湾的野心是由来已久的。1867年曾经派其舰队来进攻台湾，被我们英勇的台湾人击退，1874年援助日本攻击台湾；1895年甲午战争时期又援助日本压迫满清割让台湾。日本投降后，美国侵略者就借口援蒋直接用武力占领台湾，企图利用台湾做跳板来侵略我们的祖国。台湾今天还不能解放就是因为美帝侵略的缘故。
    祖国向来奉行和平政策，主张用和平协商来解决国际纷争。美帝企图用拖延谈判来达成长期占领台湾的目的，用战争威胁来阻止我国解放台湾。但是我们不能无限期地容忍美国拖延谈判。我们要和平，但是并不怕战争的威胁。无论如何，祖国是一定要解放台湾的。
    周主席号召我们，“台湾同胞和一切从大陆上跑到台湾的人员，站到爱国主义旗帜下来，同祖国人民一起，为争取和平解放台湾、实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗吧！”我们完全拥护这个伟大的号召！
    其次，我要说，解放台湾不但是祖国的责任，同时也是台湾同胞的责任。在这伟大的解放斗争中，我们不是无能为力的。我们要认识我们的力量。美国要利用中国人打中国人来达到侵略我国的目的。我们要粉碎这种阴谋，我们有能力粉碎它。
    最后，我想谈谈台湾同胞怎样在争取和平解放台湾的光荣任务中贡献出力量。我们是有力量的。我想可以这样做。全省人民要团结在一起，对于国民党军政人员，只要他们能够悔悟，只要他们是爱国的、愿意走和平解放台湾的道路的，台湾同胞应该主动地去团结他们，不要再分本省人和外省人，不要再追究既往，凡是爱国人民都必须团结在一起，要求台湾地方当局走和平解放台湾的道路。我们当然要预计到我们面前有种种困难，有残酷的迫害。但是我们必须克服一切困难来完成光荣的任务。当我们面临困难的时候，就应该想起“祖国无比的力量和宏大无边的恩爱经常在支援我们。”我们并不是孤立无援的。祖国一定要解放台湾。台湾同胞团结一致坚持奋斗吧！
    毛主席告诉我们，“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。”祖国人民今天的幸福生活就是台湾同胞明日的光明前途。台湾同胞是一定要回到祖国怀抱里来的，我们的前途是光明的，大家努力奋斗吧！
