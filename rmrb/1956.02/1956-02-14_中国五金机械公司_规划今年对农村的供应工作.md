The China National Hardware and Machinery Company has comprehensively planned the supply of materials and tools needed for rural water conservancy construction, broadcasting line installation, and agricultural tool maintenance in 1956, based on national plans and material resources.

The plan specifies that over 60,000 tons of galvanized iron wire, over 50,000 tons of round nails, and over 40,000 bolts of iron wire mesh will be supplied to rural areas in 1956. These materials can be used to construct over 2 million lower-spring wells and install broadcasting lines capable of powering over 500,000 loudspeakers, as well as install 500,000 kilometers of telephone lines. In addition, the company plans to supply rural areas with over 20 million pieces of hand tools such as wire pliers and flat round files, over 5 million pieces of tools such as hammers and iron shovels, and small hardware worth over 50 million yuan.

The China National Hardware and Machinery Company has also studied the quality and price of goods supplied to rural areas, as well as the establishment of rural commercial networks. (Xiong Huisan)
