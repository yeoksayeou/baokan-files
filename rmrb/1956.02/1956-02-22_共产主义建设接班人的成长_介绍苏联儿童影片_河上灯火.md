    Produced by Gorky Film Studio, Soviet Union. Dubbed by Changchun Film Studio
    The excellent color children's film "Lights on the River" is adapted from the literary work of the same name by writer N. Dubov. It faithfully conveys the bright, optimistic tone and patriotic spirit of the original work, vividly recreating the theme of the original on the screen.
    The film depicts the story of Young Pioneer Kostya visiting his uncle. In the mountains and fields beside the Dnieper River, Kostya lives with his uncle Yefim, cousin Nula, and Nula's classmates Misha and Dimasha: swimming, boating, fishing, going to small islands to help the collective farm collect wicker, lighting the buoys on the river on stormy nights... spending a summer full of novelty, joy, and interest. Such a concise, simple, and complete structure fully meets the requirements of young audiences for the appreciation of film art.
    The excellence of the film lies in its depiction of the development of characters and its profound revelation of the spiritual world of children. The images of the main characters in the film are vivid and lifelike. Through these unforgettable artistic images, especially through the growth of Kostya, the film affectionately provides young audiences with a good education in ideological and moral character.
    Kostya is a smart child. Although he is very young, he already shows a sense of Soviet pride. He wants to be a sailor and create a great cause. When saying goodbye to his mother and sister, he is even unwilling to kiss them, feeling that it is a womanish thing to do, which shows how proud and self-respecting this child is.
    Indeed, this is a good side of Kostya: strong, confident, enthusiastic, and idealistic. But like all children, he also has shortcomings, such as being superficial, not down-to-earth, and liking to show off. A child with his character may develop into an excellent person in the future, but he may also become an arrogant and useless person. It mainly depends on what kind of education he receives.
    The film makes us believe that under the care of the Soviet Party and government, and under the guidance of adults for their successors, Kostya will surely correct his shortcomings and gradually develop in a good direction.
    Kostya's superficial character is shown at the beginning of the film: in order to "create" an extraordinary identity for himself, he specially ran to a classmate's house to borrow a sailor's undershirt to wear before boarding the ship; he didn't know much about ships, but on the ship, he kept talking to the Young Pioneers on board. He looks down on small things and ordinary labor. He looks down on the seemingly ordinary rural life. He looks down on his cousin who is busy with housework. He even looks down on his uncle's work of managing buoys, thinking that this work is "too monotonous" and not as interesting as managing a lighthouse. He fantasizes about doing great things, but does not understand the meaning of ordinary labor.
    The correction of Kostya's shortcomings, the education and influence of adults on him, especially the education and influence of his uncle Yefim, are very important. The adults appearing in the film fully demonstrate their care and love for the next generation.
    Yefim is an excellent buoy manager and used to be a sailor. He understands the child's personality and interests and is good at grasping small things in daily life to enlighten and guide Kostya. He tells Kostya the story of a sailor who bravely rescued a person floating while grabbing a mine. When Kostya exclaimed, "This is a heroic deed!" he said, "I think this is a responsibility, a duty." When Kostya, who can't do anything, can't chop wood well and complains that the axe is an outdated tool, he teaches Kostya: a capable person can do a good job no matter what tools he uses. And people are not born with skills. As long as "you don't refuse any work, you will discover your skills." These words left a deep impression in Kostya's mind. When he learned that the brave sailor was his uncle himself, he came into contact with his uncle's heroic and humble excellent qualities.
    Pavlovich, the director of the collective farm radio station, is a rigorous person, and he takes any small shortcomings of the children very seriously. When Misha introduces the situation of the radio station to Kostya, revealing complacency in his words, Pavlovich repeatedly calls Misha's name and tells him "don't be proud." His admonition to Misha also alerted Kostya.
    The actions and words of these adults in the film have had a great impact on the children's hearts; their lives and work are also worthy of the children's learning.
    While depicting these adults, the film also shapes the lovely images of children such as Nula, Misha, and Dimasha. It is very helpful for Kostya to befriend these excellent children.
    Nula, Misha, and Dimasha are all children with excellent academic performance and lofty ideals, but they also diligently engage in daily labor: Nula is a good "little housewife" who manages the home very well; Misha is a small mechanic at the radio station, and he understands the truth that "without screws, the tank cannot move a step", and he is willing to work at the station as a screw; Dimasha is wholeheartedly cultivating various fruit trees, and even if they are about to wither, he is still responsible for taking care of them and trying to revive them. Their love for ordinary labor and their serious and persistent spirit in work have deeply influenced Kostya, who is ambitious and unrealistic. And finally, when he personally worked with his uncle Yefim, braving the storm, carrying the lamp, and illuminating the ship to safely pass the "Devil's Teeth" - a reef, he understood how glorious it is to manage the buoy and the true meaning of ordinary labor.
    It can be seen that when Kostya left his uncle's home, he was different from the past. He put away the sailor's undershirt and put it in his backpack, feeling that the time for him to wear this dress had not yet come; he also hid the naval cap badge that his uncle gave him as a souvenir, and he said to his companions, "I am not qualified to wear this yet." He has abandoned his shortcomings and cultivated the qualities of humility and love of labor.
    The film depicts Kostya's transformation from many aspects, so it seems that Kostya's transformation is not spontaneous, nor is it sudden or accidental, but has a certain social and life basis. On the one hand, he realized his shortcomings from his own life experience and exercise; on the other hand, he realized the truth of life from the noble behavior and labor of others. Therefore, his transformation seems very natural, vivid, real, and persuasive.
    The film also shows the activities of more children from a wider field of life through many scenes. Here, we see the Young Pioneers visiting the tombs of the poet Shevchenko and the writer Gaidar, the Young Pioneers doing voluntary labor for the collective farm to repair fences.... The rich and diverse life of the new society gives the new generation many good things; the children also regard themselves as the masters of the new society, and in their positive attitude towards life, they use excellent learning and diligent labor to realize the wish to contribute all their strength to their beloved motherland, and to inherit the task of building communism. The film "Lights on the River" vividly shows the growth of these successors to communist construction.

    共产主义建设接班人的成长
    ——介绍苏联儿童影片“河上灯火”——
    陈伯吹
    编剧：格·格列布涅尔　总导演：弗·爱依晒门塔　翻译：孔晓光　李玉华
    苏联高尔基电影制片厂出品　长春电影制片厂译制
    优秀的彩色少年儿童影片“河上灯火”，是根据作家尼·杜波夫的同名文学作品改编摄制的。它忠实地传达了原著的明朗、乐观的情调和爱国主义精神，把原著的主题思想形象地在银幕上再现了出来。
    影片描叙的是少年先锋队员柯斯嘉到舅舅家去作客的故事。在第聂伯河旁边的山野里，柯斯嘉和舅舅耶菲姆、表妹纽拉以及纽拉的同学米沙、季玛沙等生活在一起：游泳、划船、钓鱼、上小岛去帮助集体农庄采集柳条、在狂风暴雨的夜里去点燃河上的浮标灯……度过了充满新奇事物的、快乐而又有意思的夏天。这样一个简洁、单纯而又圆满的结构，是完全符合少年观众对于电影艺术欣赏的要求的。
    影片的出色处更在于它刻划了人物性格的发展，深刻地揭示了儿童的精神世界。影片中主要人物的形象都是鲜明、生动的。通过这些令人难忘的艺术形象，特别是通过柯斯嘉的成长，影片亲切地对少年观众进行了一次很好的思想品德教育。
    柯斯嘉是一个聪明的孩子。虽然年纪很小，已经表现出一种苏维埃人的自豪感。他想做一个水兵，想要创造一番轰轰烈烈的事迹。在跟妈妈和妹妹告别的时候，他甚至不愿跟她们吻脸，觉得这是婆婆妈妈的事，这就说明，这个孩子的性格是多么高傲，自尊心是多么强了。
    的确，这是柯斯嘉好的一面：刚强、自信、热情和有理想。但是正像所有的孩子一样，他也有缺点，那就是浮夸、不踏实、喜欢炫耀自己。像他这样性格的孩子，将来可能发展成一个很优秀的人，但也可能变成一个骄傲自大、一事无成的人。这主要看他受到的是什么样的教育。
    影片使我们相信：在苏联党和政府的关怀下，在成年人对自己接班人的教导下，柯斯嘉一定会纠正他的缺点逐渐向好的方向发展。
    柯斯嘉的浮夸的性格在影片一开始就表现出来了：为了给自己“制造”一个不平凡的身份，他临到上轮船的时候，还特地跑到同学家里去借了一件水兵汗衫穿上；他本来对轮船懂得不多，可是在船上他却不断向同船的少先队员们讲这讲那。他看不起细小的事情，平凡的劳动，他看不起表面上看来平淡无奇的乡下生活，他看不起忙着弄家务的表妹，他甚至看不起舅舅的管理浮标的工作，认为这种工作“太单调了”，没有管灯塔有意思。他幻想着干了不起的大事情，却不懂得平凡劳动的意义。
    柯斯嘉这些缺点的得到纠正，成年人对他的教育和影响，特别是耶菲姆舅舅对他的教育和影响是很大的。影片中出现的成年人，充分地表现出他们对下一代的关怀和爱护。
    耶菲姆是一个优秀的浮标管理员，过去作过水兵。他了解孩子的个性和兴趣，善于抓住日常生活里的细小事情启发和诱导柯斯嘉。他给柯斯嘉讲了一个水兵奋不顾身救出抓住水雷漂浮的人的故事。当柯斯嘉失声叫道，“这就是英雄事迹呀！”他却说：“我认为这是责任，是应尽的义务。”当什么也不会做的柯斯嘉帮他砍木头砍不好，埋怨斧头是落后的工具的时候，他又教导柯斯嘉：有本领的人，不论使用什么工具都能做好工作。而且人不是生下来就有本领的。只要“任何工作你也别拒绝，你就会发现自己的本领了。”这些话在柯斯嘉的脑子里留下了深刻的印象。当他知道那个英勇的水兵就是舅舅自己的时候，他接触到了舅舅的英勇而又谦逊的优秀品质。
    集体农庄广播站主任巴夫洛维奇是个严谨的人，他对待孩子们的任何细小的缺点都是很认真的。当米沙向柯斯嘉介绍广播站的情况，言语之间流露出自满情绪的时候，巴夫洛维奇就一再唤着米沙的名字，叫他“不要骄傲”。他对米沙告诫，也同样警惕着柯斯嘉。
    影片中出现的这些成年人，他们的一举一动，一言一语，在孩子的心灵里，都产生了巨大的影响；他们的生活和工作，也是值得孩子学习的榜样。
    影片在描写这些成年人的时候，也塑造了纽拉、米沙、季玛沙等儿童的可爱的形象。柯斯嘉和这几个优秀的孩子们发生友谊，对他来说是有很大帮助的。
    纽拉、米沙和季玛沙都是学习成绩优良具有远大理想的孩子，但是他们也勤勤恳恳地从事日常劳动：纽拉是个很好的“小主妇”，她把家管理得非常好；米沙是广播站的小机务员，他懂得“没有螺丝钉，坦克一步也走不动”的道理，自己愿意作为一只螺丝钉在站上工作；季玛沙专心一意地培植着各种果树，即使是快要枯死了的，也仍然负责照管它，想法使它活过来。他们对平凡的劳动的热爱和在工作中认真执着的精神，深深地影响了好高骛远，不务实际的柯斯嘉。而最后，当他亲自和耶菲姆舅舅一起，冒着暴风雨，提着灯，照着轮船从“鬼牙”——暗礁旁边安全地驶过的时候，他更懂得了管理浮标工作是一项多么光荣的职责，懂得了平凡劳动的真正意义。
    看得出来，柯斯嘉从舅舅那儿动身回家的时候，他已经跟过去不同了。他把水兵穿的汗衫收起来放进背囊，觉得自己穿这衣服的时候还没有到来；舅舅送给他的海军帽徽他也当作纪念品藏起来，他向伙伴们说，“我还没有资格带这个。”他已经抛弃了自己的缺点，培养了谦逊、爱劳动的品质。
    影片对柯斯嘉的转变是从多方面刻划出来的，因此显得柯斯嘉的转变不是自发的，也不是突然的或偶然的，而是有一定的社会的和生活的基础。他一方面从自己的生活锻炼和体验中认识了自己的缺点；一方面从别人崇高的行为和劳动里认识到生活的真理。所以他的转变看来是很自然的，生动真实而且具有说服力。
    影片还通过许多场面，从更广大的生活领域里表现了更众多的孩子们的活动。在这里，我们看到少先队员们在参观诗人舍甫琴柯和作家盖达尔的墓，少先队员们在为集体农庄作修理篱笆的义务劳动……。新社会的丰富多样的生活，给予新生一代以许多美好的东西；孩子们也以新社会的主人自居，在对待生活的积极态度中，用优良的学习和勤恳的劳动来实现把自己的一切力量贡献给亲爱的祖国的愿望，来继承起建设共产主义的任务。影片“河上灯火”生动地表现了这些共产主义建设接班人的成长。
