Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th – Liu Yongming, a Chinese student who had been confined in an American mental hospital for six years, arrived in Guangzhou at 5:30 PM today with his wife, daughter, and younger brother. He told reporters, "I am very happy to be back in the motherland. The experiences of the past month have exhausted me too much." From the train station, Liu Yongming and his family took a car to the Aiqun Mansion to rest.

A doctor and a nurse from the Guangzhou Mental Hospital and a representative from the Ministry of Higher Education specially rushed to Shenzhen this morning to accompany Liu Yongming by train to Guangzhou. Liu Yongming had been detained in a refugee camp in Hong Kong from January 31st while on his way back to China. Only yesterday afternoon did he and his family leave Hong Kong for Shenzhen.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th – Former Chinese student in the United States, Liu Yongming, went to the Second Hospital of the South China Medical College this morning, where famous experts from Guangzhou conducted a thorough physical examination on him.

Liu Yongming returned to Guangzhou at 5:30 PM yesterday from Shenzhen. A doctor who specifically went to Shenzhen to take care of Liu Yongming on his journey said: "Liu Yongming shows signs of extreme nervous tension due to years of persecution." After Liu Yongming was detained for six years in an American mental hospital before being released, American secret agents applied pressure on him, attempting to force him to not return to his own country. Liu Yongming's younger brother, Dr. Liu Yongchang, told Xinhua reporters on the evening of the 7th that when Liu Yongming arrived in Yokohama, Japan, "a person calling himself Gui Ziliang came aboard the 'President Wilson' ship, claiming to be my sister-in-law's uncle. He tried to intimidate my brother to abandon his intention to return to China. My sister-in-law said that she has no such uncle in Japan. This is one of the ways American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents tried to intimidate my brother."

Dr. Liu Yongchang also mentioned a letter his brother received while staying in a refugee camp in Hong Kong. The letter requested that Liu Yongming refuse to go to the "Communist area" and forget his wife and daughter. The letter, falsely claiming to be sent by his mother, said that Liu Yongming's five brothers were all in Taiwan. Liu Yongchang said, "That letter is not in my mother's handwriting. All her sons are on the mainland."

A representative of the Ministry of Higher Education of the People's Republic of China has notified Liu Yongming's wife that the Ministry of Higher Education will make all necessary arrangements for her husband to rest and recuperate in any place he likes.

Liu Yongming's wife, Gui Qionghua, said: "I cannot find the words to express my gratitude to our government. If the government had not handled his case, he might have been imprisoned in an American concentration camp for the rest of his life." (Attached photo)

    刘永铭回到广州并进行身体检查
    新华社广州7日电　在美国神经病院里禁锢了6年的我国留美学生刘永铭，今天下午5点30分同他的妻子、女儿和弟弟到达了广州。他对记者说：“回到了祖国十分高兴。过去一个月的经历使我太疲乏了。”从火车站上刘永铭和他的家人坐汽车到爱群大厦住下休息。
    广州神经病院的一位医生、一位护士和高等教育部的一位代表今天上午特地赶到深圳陪同刘永铭坐火车到广州。刘永铭在回国途中曾从1月31日起被拘留在香港的难民营中，昨天下午才同他的家人离开香港到深圳。
    新华社广州8日电　中国前留美学生刘永铭今天上午到华南医学院第二医院，由广州有名的专家为他进行彻底的体格检查。
    刘永铭是昨天下午5时30分从深圳回到广州的。特地到深圳去在旅途上照顾刘永铭的一位医师说：“刘永铭由于多年遭受迫害，现在有极度神经紧张的迹象。”当刘永铭在美国的一所神经病院里被扣留了6年才获得释放之后，美国特务又对他施行了压力，企图迫使他不能回到自己的祖国。刘永铭的弟弟刘永錩医师7日晚上对新华社记者说，当刘永铭到达日本横滨的时候，“一个自称桂子梁的人到‘威尔逊总统号’船上来，自称是我嫂嫂的叔父。他企图恐吓我的哥哥，使他放弃回国的意图。我嫂嫂说，她在日本并没有这样一个叔父。这就是美国和蒋介石特务企图威吓我的哥哥的方式之一”。
    刘永錩医师还谈到他哥哥住在香港难民营时收到的一封信。这封信要求刘永铭拒绝到“共产党地区”去，要他忘掉他的妻子和女儿。假称是他的母亲寄来的这封信说，刘永铭的五个兄弟都在台湾。刘永錩说：“那封信不是我母亲的笔迹。她所有的儿子都在大陆上。”
    中华人民共和国高等教育部的代表已经通知刘永铭的妻子说，高等教育部将作出一切必要的安排，让她的丈夫到他喜欢的任何地方去休息和休养。
    刘永铭的妻子桂琼华说：“我找不出言语来表达我对我们的政府的感激。如果政府没有处理他的问题，他可能被囚禁在一个美国集中营里终其一生。”（附图片）
