    The Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has cultivated a group of young research personnel who are capable of conducting independent research work.

    These young research personnel are all university graduates who have just left school for a few years. Wang Yuan, who graduated from university four years ago, is being guided by Professor Hua Luogeng, the director of the Institute of Mathematics, to carry out research work. Wang Yuan's paper on the numerical distribution of functions, written in 1955, received high praise from mathematicians. Assistant Researcher Xi Sheng, who was previously guided by Professor Chen Jiangong and is now guided by Hua Luogeng, has published more than 10 mathematical papers in the past two years, which are highly original. His research in the field of univalent functions has been praised by veteran mathematicians in our country.

    The senior scientists of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have adopted various methods to cultivate young research personnel. From October 1953 to December 1955, Hua Luogeng gave "Introduction to Number Theory" lectures to the young research personnel of the number theory group of the institute, and also specially opened a lecture class for them to help these young research personnel learn the methods of studying mathematics.

    科学院数学研究所培养了一批青年数学家
    中国科学院数学研究所已经培养出一批年轻的、能够独立进行研究工作的青年研究人员。
    这些青年研究人员都是离开学校刚几年的大学毕业生。四年前从大学毕业的王元，由数学研究所所长华罗庚教授指导他进行研究工作。王元在1955年所写的一篇关于函数数值分布的论文，得到数学家很高的评价。曾由陈建功教授指导、现在由华罗庚指导的助理研究员袭升在最近两年来发表的10多篇数学论文，具有很高的独创性。他在单叶函数方面的研究受到我国老数学家的称赞。
    中国科学院数学研究所的老科学家采取各种办法培养青年研究人员。从1953年10月到1955年12月。华罗庚为研究所数论组的青年研究人员讲“数论导引”，并且专门为他们开了一个讲习班，帮助这些青年研究人员学习研究数学的方法。
