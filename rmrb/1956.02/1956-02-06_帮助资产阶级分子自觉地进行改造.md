Helping Bourgeois Elements Consciously Transform Themselves
By our reporter Yu Ming

In a joint state-private owned maltose factory in Bengbu City, there are 18 capitalists living a new life. Of these, 7 were originally from the capitalist side of the maltose factory, while the other 11 were wholesalers who switched professions in early 1955 when preparations for the joint state-private ownership were underway. They invested their capital into production and implemented the "four-horse split the loot" method, and they themselves entered the factory to take on certain jobs. The facts of the past year have proven that we can not only transform capitalist enterprises well, but also help capitalists consciously transform themselves, so that they gradually change from people who live by exploitation to people who live by labor.

When the maltose factory was preparing for joint ownership, the Party organization (initially a group, later established as a branch) of the maltose factory paid attention to the transformation of the capitalists. First, the Party organization understood the ideological situation of the capitalist personnel. They were willing to accept transformation, but had various concerns: Would the job arrangements be reasonable? Could they endure the labor? Would they have the right to speak under the supervision of the workers? And some workers also had incorrect understanding and unhealthy emotions, such as some doubting that capitalists could participate in labor, etc.

The Party organization analyzed these ideological situations and believed that in order to implement the Party's policy of transforming capitalists, it was necessary to first unify the thinking of Party members and workers, and then mobilize all Party members and all workers to do a good job in the transformation of capitalists. Therefore, the Party organization conducted education on unity and transformation of capitalists for Party members and all workers through various meetings, criticized various incorrect understandings, and called on everyone to show the spirit of the working class and the enthusiasm of the working class to provide concrete help and necessary supervision to the capitalists.

Next, after research by the Party organization and the factory, and after consultation with the capitalist employees, arrangements were made for the work of the capitalists. In addition to the original factory manager serving as the deputy director, some capitalists, according to their characteristics, served as deputy section chiefs, salesmen, and other management positions; some capitalists, due to their own conditions, with their consent, decided to directly participate in the production of the workshop.

After the work was arranged, the Party organization and the public share representatives in the factory actively helped them master their business, improve their sense of responsibility, and cultivate their work ability. Deputy Director Wang Wenzhong was the manager of the original enterprise. After the joint state-private ownership, he mistakenly believed that he had unloaded the burden and handed over all the work to the public representatives. The responsible comrade of the Party organization had individual talks with him, explaining the Party's trust and support for him, and explaining that to run the enterprise well, everyone must be jointly responsible. At the same time, he educated the factory's employees to respect the deputy director in their work, consult with him on matters, and make specific divisions of labor with the director in leadership. In this way, Wang Wenzhong gradually became active in his work. In the past, he could not stay in the factory for two hours a day, but now he works in the factory all day and can find problems in production and propose improvement suggestions. In the past, when the maltose factory made syrup, an urn would contain 200 jin of raw materials, and there would be thirty or forty jin of impurities, which not only affected the quality of the sugar, but also affected the increase in output. Recently, Wang Wenzhong proposed an improvement suggestion to wash away the impurities in the raw materials before they are put into the urn, which improved the quality of the sugar and increased the sugar yield by more than 20%. Capitalist employee Chen Zhuxuan, after serving as the deputy section chief of the supply and marketing section, was active and responsible in his work, but his leadership ability was not strong, and some employees in the section did not respect his leadership enough. In the first two or three months, the management work in the section was chaotic, and serious errors occurred in the work. The Party organization and the person in charge of the factory, seeing this situation, personally helped Chen Zhuxuan hold four section meetings, made specific divisions of labor, and established a work system. In addition, the Party organization also had individual talks with Chen Zhuxuan, comforting him and encouraging him. The Party organization educated employees who did not obey the leadership through individual talks. Now Chen Zhuxuan's leadership methods have improved, his work ability has also improved, and he has gradually mastered the business.

Capitalist employees who participated in workshop production have also made great progress under the patient education of the Party organization and the specific care and help of the workers. For example, capitalist employee Ma Chengfu is now able to operate simple machines, Zhang Mingshu has learned the technique of washing wheat, and Zheng Xingmin has also mastered the technique of making sugar. Capitalist employee Ding Wenbing, after mastering the technology, said to the workers with emotion: "I will definitely follow you!" The workers said: "If you follow us, we will definitely bring you into socialist society."

Over the past year, the Party organization's education and transformation of the capitalist employees in this enterprise has greatly changed their attitude towards labor, improved their relationship with the workers, and enhanced their socialist consciousness. The recent upsurge of industry-wide transformation in various places has even more excited them. They jointly wrote a letter to the director saying: "The fixed interest method, as we understand it, has a positive meaning in promoting the ideological transformation of individuals, preventing the possible growth of capitalist profit-seeking ideas, and is beneficial to individuals, enterprises, and the country. Therefore, we earnestly request that our factory implement the fixed interest method and further push the relations of production in the socialist direction." From this letter, it can be clearly seen that under the education of the Communist Party, as long as these capitalists consciously transform themselves, they can control their own destiny and become self-reliant laborers.

    帮助资产阶级分子自觉地进行改造
    本报记者　于明
    在蚌埠市的一个公私合营饴糖厂里，有18个资本家，在过着新的生活。这些人员，除了有7个人是原来饴糖厂的资方人员外，其他11个资本家，都是在1955年初筹备公私合营的时候，由批发商转业而来的。他们把资本投入生产，实行“四马分肥”的办法，自己也就随着走进工厂，担任了一定的工作。一年来的事实证明，我们不但可以把资本主义企业改造好，也可以帮助资本家自觉地进行改造，使他们逐步从靠剥削生活的人变成靠劳动生活的人。
    在饴糖厂筹备合营的时候，中共饴糖厂的党组织（最初是小组，后来成立了支部）就注意了对资本家的人的改造问题。首先，党组织了解了资方人员的思想情况，他们是愿意接受改造的，但却有种种顾虑：工作安排会不会合理呢？劳动能不能吃得消呢？在工人的监督下有没有说话的权利呢？而工人中也有一些不正确的认识和不健康的情绪，例如有的怀疑资本家不能参加劳动等等。
    党组织根据这些思想情况作了分析，认为要贯彻执行党对资本家的改造政策，首先就要统一党员和工人的思想，然后动员全体党员和全体工人来作好对资本家的改造工作。于是党组织通过各种会议对党员和全体工人进行了团结和改造资本家的教育，批判了各种不正确的认识，号召大家拿出工人阶级的气魄和工人阶级的热情来对资本家作具体的帮助和必要的监督。
    接着，经过党组织和厂方的研究，又和资方从业人员协商之后，对资本家的工作作了安排。除了原来厂里的经理担任了副厂长外，还有一部分资本家根据每人的特点，分别担任了副课长、销货员，及其他经营管理工作；一部分资本家，因为本身的条件，在征得他们的同意之后，决定分别直接参加了车间的生产。
    工作安排以后，党组织和厂里的公股代表就积极地帮助他们掌握业务，提高他们的工作责任心和培养他们的工作能力。副厂长王文中是原来企业的经理。在公私合营以后，他错误地认为他卸掉了包袱，把一切工作都交给公方代表来处理。党组织的负责同志就和他进行个别谈话，说明党对他的信任和支持，说明要把企业办好，必须大家共同负责。同时，教育厂里的职工在工作上要尊重副厂长，有事要和他商量，并和厂长在领导上作了具体分工。这样，王文中在工作上就逐渐积极起来。过去，一天在厂里待不了两个小时，现在整天都在厂里工作，在生产上也能发现问题，提出改进意见。过去饴糖厂做糖稀，一个瓮里放200斤原料，就有三、四十斤杂质，这不但影响了糖的质量，而且影响了产量的提高。最近王文中提出了改进意见，把原料中的杂质在入瓮以前就洗掉，这样就提高了糖的质量，出糖率也提高了20％多。资方从业人员陈竹轩，担任了供销课的副课长以后，工作虽然积极负责，但是领导能力不强，课里有些职员对他的领导也就不够尊重。最初两三个月，课里的管理工作混乱，工作中发生了严重的差错。党组织和厂方负责人，看到这种情况，就亲自帮助陈竹轩开了四次课务会议，进行了具体分工和建立了工作制度。另外，党组织还和陈竹轩进行个别谈话，安慰他，鼓励他。对不服从领导的职员，党组织就通过个别谈话的方式进行了教育。现在陈竹轩的领导方法已有改进，工作能力也有所提高，已把业务逐渐掌握起来。
    参加车间生产的资方从业人员，在党组织的耐心教育和职工的具体照顾和帮助下，也有了很大的进步。如资方从业人员马承福，现在已经能够操纵简单的机器，张铭枢已经学会了洗麦的技术，郑醒民也掌握了做糖的技术。资方从业人员丁文炳，在掌握了技术以后感动地对工人说：“我一定跟你们走！”工人们说：“你跟我们走，我们一定把你带进社会主义社会。”
    一年以来，党组织对这个企业的资方从业人员的教育和改造，已经大大改变了他们对劳动的态度，改善了他们同工人的关系，提高了他们的社会主义觉悟。最近各地实行全行业改造的热潮，更加激动了他们，他们联名写信给厂长说：“定息办法，就我们所领会的是具有推动个人思想改造的积极意义的，制止了可能滋长的资本主义唯利是图的思想，对个人对企业对国家都是有利的。因此，我们恳切的要求本厂实行定息办法，把生产关系向社会主义方向再推进一步。”从这封信可以清楚地看到，在共产党的教育下，只要这些资本家自觉地进行改造，就能够掌握自己的命运，能够变成自食其力的劳动者。
