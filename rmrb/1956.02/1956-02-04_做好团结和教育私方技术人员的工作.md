    Do a Good Job of Uniting and Educating Private Technical Personnel
    Chen Guang, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch of the Public-Private Jointly Operated Lihe Textile Company
    Tianjin Lihe Textile Company was formally established as a public-private joint venture in August 1954. At the beginning of the joint venture, some comrades were afraid of being dragged down by the bourgeoisie, so they did not take the initiative to unite and educate private technical personnel. The Party organization criticized this incorrect idea and mobilized all Party members and cadres to strengthen the work of uniting and educating private technical personnel. In order to do this work well, the Party organization, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League also divided the work.
    At that time, 7 out of the 10 agents of the capitalist side were technical personnel. These people had technology, had a sense of enterprise, and were willing to improve the factory. This was the good side. On the other hand, they harbored bourgeois ideas and had various ideological concerns about the joint venture. For example, they were afraid that the factory's technology would be spread out, that the factory's products could no longer monopolize the market; that they would no longer be able to make decisions after the workers participated in the factory management, and even that they would have no work to do, and so on. In response to these situations, the Party organization and the administrative side first properly arranged their work according to their work ability and expertise, and also ensured that they had the position and the authority. For example, Zhao Cixue had worked in the factory for more than 30 years and was very familiar with product design and machine performance, so he was arranged to serve as an engineer. Zhai Youqing had experience in management and was also familiar with the situation in the factory, so he was arranged to serve as the manager. Liu Zhuoquan had research on pattern design and was entrusted to serve as a technician, responsible for pattern design and color matching. In order to give full play to their abilities, the administrative side also reduced some of the non-technical work they had undertaken before the joint venture, so that they could concentrate on doing a good job of technical work.
    Supporting their various rationalization proposals in their work, giving play to their enthusiasm, and at the same time promptly putting forward criticism of their shortcomings and mistakes, these are the two aspects that cannot be neglected in the work of unity and education. In the fourth quarter of 1954, Liu Zhuoquan's research on replacing Shilin colors with naphthol colors was an extremely valuable research work that saved the country's wealth. Therefore, the Party branch and the public representative warmly supported his research work, encouraged him to boldly experiment, and provided him with the necessary experimental supplies and equipment. During the two-month experimental period, the responsible comrades of the Party organization and the public representative went to his laboratory almost every day to understand the experimental situation and encourage him to work hard to overcome various difficulties and complete the experimental work. The deep concern of the Party and the country for his work moved him very much. He said, "With the Party supporting me like this, I will definitely be able to research successfully!" Sure enough, his research work was successful, reducing the cost of dyeing materials for each piece of cotton yarn by about 80%. In 1955 alone, it saved the country more than 10,000 yuan. The administrative leadership praised him at the staff meeting and gave him material rewards. In March and April 1955, he also successfully researched the replacement of Indigosol colors with Rapid colors, saving the country a lot of valuable materials. However, in the third quarter, he made an accident of more than 400 defective products due to a color matching error. After the accident, he developed the wrong idea of "better to do less than to do more" and wanted to abandon the use of new dyes and continue to use the original valuable dyes. At that time, the Party organization pointed out to him that this idea was wrong. He should not be discouraged when encountering failure, but should learn from the lessons of failure and continue to improve his work. Later, under the guidance of the administrative leadership, he and the staff formulated some color matching work systems and quickly solved the problem.
    In the fourth quarter of 1954, due to negligence in work, some staff members did not purchase the processed toweling quilts sent by other factories, resulting in the interruption of production. The Party organization and the administrative leadership also criticized and educated the private deputy manager responsible for this work, which strengthened his sense of responsibility for business management.
    To unite and transform these technical personnel, not only should we consult with them more on work issues, but also care for them in life. Zhao Cixue was old and sickly, and the Party organization suggested that the administration allow him to work in the morning and rest in the afternoon; when he was sick, the staff of the Party organization also went to his home to visit him. The Party organization's concern for him moved him very much. He said, "The Party cares about us so much, we must work hard; in the past, we had technology to eat, to compete for fame; now it is to build socialism." Because his thinking changed, he worked very actively, such as giving lectures to interns when he was sick, and sometimes working until 12 o'clock at night. He was afraid that his poor health would affect production, so he took the initiative to ask the administrative leadership to transfer someone to work with him. The administrative leadership accepted his suggestion and transferred a young worker and a technician to learn technology from him. Deputy Manager Zhang Qianfu's old illness relapsed, and the company paid for his medical expenses. Due to the Party's concern for him, his enthusiasm for work was also very high.
    The Party organization also educated these technical personnel to rely on the masses and go deep into reality in their work. In the past, they rarely went to the workshop, and even if they did, they would just take a cursory look and not offer any opinions on the shortcomings of production. Now they are beginning to value the wisdom of the masses and often go to the workshop to discuss problems with the workers. The facts have been very educational for them. For example, Liu Zhuoquan once printed the bed sheets with printed patterns due to poor color matching. The workers offered opinions, but he did not accept them; later, the workers took the initiative to improve the printing method, and the printed bed sheet patterns were no longer printed. After this incident, Liu Zhuoquan trusted the collective wisdom of the workers and established a regular contact system with the workshop director in order to listen to the workers' opinions frequently. On the other hand, we also educated the workers to respect the opinions of these technical personnel in their work and to help them carry out self-transformation in their actual work.

    做好团结和教育私方技术人员的工作
    中共公私合营利和织物公司支部书记　陈光
    天津利和织物公司是在1954年8月正式公私合营的。合营开始的时候，有些同志有怕被资产阶级拖下去的思想，因此没有主动地去团结和教育私方技术人员。党组织批判了这种不正确的想法，并且动员全体党员和干部来加强团结和教育私方技术人员的工作。为了做好这个工作，党组织和行政、工会、青年团还进行了分工。
    当时资方10个代理人中7个是技术人员，这些人有技术，有事业心，愿意把工厂搞好，这是好的一面；另一方面，存有资产阶级思想，对合营有各种思想顾虑。如怕把本厂的技术传出去，怕本厂的产品再也不能垄断市场；怕工人参加工厂管理后，自己再也不能作主，甚至怕自己没有工作可做等等。针对这些情况，党组织和行政方面首先根据他们的工作能力和特长妥善地安排了他们的工作，而且做到有职有权。例如赵次雪在工厂里工作了30多年，对产品的设计和机器的性能等都很熟悉，就被安排担任工程师的职务。翟有卿在管理工作上有经验，对厂内情况也比较熟悉，就被安排担任经理的职务。刘濯泉对图案设计有研究，被委托担任技师，负责图案设计和配色工作。为了充分发挥他们的能力，行政方面还减少了他们在合营前担任的一些非技术性的工作，使他们能专心搞好技术工作。
    支持他们工作中各种合理化建议，发挥他们的积极性，同时及时地对他们的缺点和错误提出批评意见，这是团结和教育工作中不能偏废的两个方面。1954年第四季度，刘濯泉研究以纳夫妥色代替士林色，这是一个节约国家财富的极有价值的研究工作。因此党支部和公方代表热烈地支持他的研究工作，鼓励他大胆去试验，并供给他必要的试验用品和仪器设备。在两个多月的试验期间，党组织负责同志和公方代表几乎每天都到他的试验室中去了解试验情况，鼓励他努力克服各种困难，完成试验工作。党和国家对他的工作的深切关心，使他很感动。他说：“党这样支持我，我一定能研究成功！”果然，他的研究工作成功了，使每块棉纱的染色材料成本降低了80％左右，1955年一年就为国家节省一万多元。行政领导就在职工大会上对他进行了表扬，并给予物质奖励。1955年三、四月，他又研究以拉皮达色代替印地克素尔色，取得了成功，给国家节约很多贵重材料。但在第三季度，他曾因配色错误造成了一次出400多打残品的事故。事故发生后，他产生了“多一事不如少一事”的错误想法，想放弃使用新染料，仍使用原有的贵重染料。当时，党组织就向他指出，这种想法是不对的，不应该遇到失败就气馁，而应该接受失败的教训，继续改进工作。后来他在行政领导的指导下，和职工一起订出了一些配色的工作制度，很快就解决了这个问题。
    1954年第四季度，因工作上的疏忽，有些工作人员没有收购外厂送来的加工毛巾被，结果使生产中断。党组织和行政领导对负责这一工作的私方副经理也进行了批评教育，这样就加强了他对经营管理的责任心。
    要团结和改造这些技术人员，不但工作上有问题要多和他们商量，并且要在生活上关怀他们。赵次雪年老多病，党组织建议行政让他上午工作下午休息；当他生病的时候，党组织的工作人员还到他家中去探望。党组织对他的关怀很使他感动，他说：“党这样关心我们，我们一定要好好干；过去有技术是为了吃饭，为了争名誉；现在则是为了建设社会主义。”因为他的思想起了变化，工作十分积极，如带病给实习生讲课，有时工作到晚上12点钟。他怕自己身体不好影响生产，主动要求行政领导上调人和他一起工作。行政领导接受了他的意见，调了一个青年工人和一个技术人员跟他学习技术。副经理张潜孚旧病复发，公司方面担负了他医药费用。由于党对他的关心，他的工作积极性也很高。
    党组织还教育这些技术人员在工作中依靠群众，深入实际。过去他们很少下车间，即使下车间也是走马看花，对生产上的缺点不提什么意见。现在他们开始重视群众的智慧，时常下车间去和工人研究问题。事实对他们的教育是很大的，如刘濯泉有一次因配色不好，印出来的床单花色有印的现象，工人们提出意见，他不接受；后来工人主动地改进了印刷方法，印出来的床单花色就不印了。这件事发生后，刘濯泉才信任工人的集体智慧，和车间主任建立了定期的联系制度，以便经常听取工人的意见。另一方面，我们也教育工人在工作上尊重这些技术人员的意见，并在实际工作中帮助他们进行自我改造。
