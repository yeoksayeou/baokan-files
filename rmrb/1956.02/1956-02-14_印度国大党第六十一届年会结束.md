Xinhua News Agency, Amritsar, February 13th: The sixty-first annual meeting of the Indian National Congress held here concluded on the evening of February 12th. Before the close of the meeting, resolutions proposed by the Resolutions Committee regarding economic policy and the Five-Year Plan, regarding the division of provinces and regions and the call for savings, and regarding amendments to the party constitution and organizational issues were adopted.

When asking the annual meeting to approve the proposal on economic policy and the Five-Year Plan, Prime Minister Nehru described the achievements India had made based on the First Five-Year Plan. He said: National income has increased by 18%. Despite unusual adverse factors, such as the floods that damaged crops in nearly half of India last year, India has been able to control the food situation.

Nehru said: The real problem in India lies in the countryside, where 75% to 80% of the population lives. Any progress that does not involve them is always false. Therefore, rural work is a fundamental matter.

Nehru said: The draft of the Second Five-Year Plan has three goals, namely: to lay the foundation for heavy machinery industry, to explore and maximize the use of India's mineral deposits and other resources, and to further develop rural development plans. He said: The main task is to produce machines in our country, to produce more steel, coal, and cement, and not to rely on others for machines. He also said that the Second Five-Year Plan stipulates the establishment of three state-owned steel plants.

Minister of Planning and Development Nanda said in his speech during the discussion that the following three things must be done: increase production, eliminate unemployment, and eliminate income inequality.

Some other representatives also spoke during the discussion.

    印度国大党第六十一届年会结束
    新华社阿姆利则13日电　在这里举行的印度国大党第六十一届年会已经在2月12日晚结束。会议在结束前通过了提案委员会提出的关于经济政策和五年计划、关于省区划分和号召储蓄”以及修改党章和组织问题的决议。
    尼赫鲁总理在要求年会通过关于经济政策和五年计划的提案时叙述了印度依据第一个五年计划所获得的成就。他说：国民收入增加了18％。尽管有异乎寻常的不利因素，像去年曾经在印度的将近一半的地方损害了农作物的水灾，印度已经能够控制住粮食的情况。
    尼赫鲁说：印度真正的问题在于农村，农村居住着75％到80％的居民。任何进步如果不涉及他们，就始终是虚假的。因此，农村工作是根本的事情。
    尼赫鲁说：第二个五年计划草案有三个目标，即：奠定重机械工业的基础、勘探和最大限度地利用印度的矿藏和其他资源、更进一步发展乡村发展计划。他说：主要的任务是在我国生产机器，生产更多的钢、煤、水泥，而不在机器方面仰仗他人。他还说，第二个五年计划规定要建立三个国有的炼钢厂。
    计划和开发部长南达在讨论时发言说：必须要做到以下的三件事：增加生产，消除失业和消除收入上的不平等现象。
    其他一些代表也在讨论中发了言。
