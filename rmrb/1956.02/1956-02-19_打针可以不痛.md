Injections Can Be Painless
Liang Jielian, Nurse, Second Hospital Directly under the Ministry of Health

Whether injections can be made painless has not been reasonably answered for a long time. Generally, medical personnel believe that injections require piercing the skin and injecting the medication into human tissues or blood vessels, so saying it is painless is incorrect. The general public also feels fear upon hearing about injections. Are injections painful? My personal experience proves that injections can be made painless. Over the past few years, using methods I summarized from my work, I have performed subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous injections, autologous blood therapy, and blood draws for many people. People have reported that they are painless, and rarely do hematomas, bruises, or lumps occur. In 1954, the Health News introduced my injection method, and some medical staff also came to visit, learn, and adopt my injection method, which also confirmed that injections can be painless.

My injection method, in summary, first determines the injection site and posture based on different patients and different conditions. Second, it involves rapidly inserting the needle with skillful technique, offsetting the skin and underlying tissues. Third, it varies the injection speed based on the different irritation levels of the medication and the tightness of the muscle tissue. Finally, it involves quickly withdrawing the needle and not rubbing after the needle is withdrawn. Each of the above steps is interconnected and mutually influential, and no step can be ignored, otherwise the desired effect will not be achieved. I call this series of treatment methods the New Injection Method.

The New Injection Method is a preliminary summary of my work experience. It was completed with the encouragement, support, and assistance of the Party, and with the close cooperation of patients.

I have been working in nursing for a long time. In my work, I often see people holding their breath and gritting their teeth to endure the pain of injections. I wondered how to eliminate the pain of injections. In the old society, a person who had not attended a specialized medical school would not have received social support and encouragement to study and solve this problem.

In 1950, I went to work at the Ministry of Heavy Industry Hospital (now renamed the Second Hospital Directly under the Ministry of Health), and I had the opportunity to research and improve the injection method. I combined some fragmented issues of injections into one problem for research. First, I studied the relationship between rubbing and internal scar-like lumps. In the past, I always believed that rubbing after an injection could accelerate the diffusion of the medication and promote the absorption of the medication by the tissue. However, in fact, rubbing caused lumps and hard masses that did not disappear for years. To solve this problem, I read relevant nursing books, extensively collected and understood the conditions of patients before and after injections of various medications, and kept detailed records of the patients I personally treated. After a period of time, I finally found the causes of lumps and hard masses that did not disappear for years (these are not allergic lumps or infectious redness and swelling). There are two common types of lumps after injections: one is because the density of the injected medication is high, and some or most of the medication cannot be diffused in time, blocking the tissue gaps and hindering the circulation of surrounding body fluids, forming lumps. The other is because when the injection needle is inserted into the dermal tissue, it damages capillaries or larger microvessels, causing more internal bleeding. The blood and medication mix, causing biochemical changes, and the medication is coagulated by the blood into lumps that are not easily diffused. These two types of lumps generally disappear after two to four days, and some disappear after two or three weeks. However, if rubbing is applied after the injection, it not only expands the needle track wound, causing greater internal bleeding, but also severely injures the tissue gap walls, even squeezing or breaking some microvessels, hindering the tissue's penetration and transport functions. The medication cannot dissipate on its own, and the collagen fibers in the body continue to proliferate and thicken, resulting in internal scar-like lumps that do not disappear for years. Based on these practical observations and analysis, I thought: reducing internal bleeding, preventing the expansion of the needle wound, and protecting the tissue's penetration and transport functions from being hindered are the main issues. In addition to not rubbing, keeping the person being injected calm and their blood pressure stable is also an important factor in reducing internal bleeding. This requires that the needle insertion and medication injection can be painless.

Not rubbing after an injection is relatively easy to do, but how to make the needle insertion and medication injection painless? In addition to thinking that I must choose sharp and strong needles, use the medication flowing out during air removal as a lubricant to reduce the resistance of the needle shaft, and relax the muscles of the person being injected, I must also make the needle insertion fast and the medication injection speed appropriate. After countless trials and improvements, I finally found the method of rapid needle insertion and painless medication injection. For example, for subcutaneous injections, I followed the conventional oblique needle insertion injection, but the person being injected always said it hurt during needle insertion. Several times I did rapid oblique needle insertion, and the patient reported that it was painless. This made me realize that the dermal tissue is denser, tougher, and densely covered with receptors than muscle tissue, and if the needle insertion speed is slow, the pain reaction is fast. I also observed and studied vertical needle insertion for intramuscular injections, and the results were similar to subcutaneous injections. This made me realize that rapid needle insertion is one of the factors in painless injections. Later, when performing gluteal intramuscular injections, I adopted rapid needle insertion throughout, and the painless rate reached 100%, and the painless rate of subcutaneous injections also reached 90%.

I had always simply attributed the pain and lack of pain of medication injection to the strength of the medication's irritation. However, several times when injecting highly irritating drugs to patients, they said they didn't feel any pain. For this reason, I repeatedly recalled the situation at the time and interviewed the patients, and only then did I realize that the correct posture of the person being injected and the appropriate injection speed are also factors in not feeling pain. After more than 10,000 injections, I realized that when injecting highly irritating medications, the injection speed should be slow, so that the medication slowly diffuses between the tissues, allowing the blood and body fluids sufficient time to slowly absorb and take away the medication. For example, when I used Agrimony Herb Element for intramuscular injection, I injected it at a speed of 1 ml in 25 to 35 seconds. Subcutaneous injections are generally slower than intramuscular injections because subcutaneous tissue absorbs more slowly. As for non-irritating medications, the injection speed can be slightly faster, but the medication should not squeeze the tissue. When a patient needs to inject several medications at the same time, they should be injected at different speeds according to the order of non-irritating to highly irritating. The painless rate of my injections containing highly irritating medications generally reaches more than 90%. From 1953 to now, I have used this injection method for nearly 70,000 injections, and the patients' feedback has been good.

As for waiting for the alcohol on the skin to dry before inserting the needle; wiping off the spilled medication and blood with a sterile dry cotton ball after withdrawing the needle; offsetting the skin before injection so that the upper and lower layers of tissue that are pierced are immediately closed after injection; waiting for the patient to calm down before injecting to reduce the chance of internal bleeding due to nervous tension, increased blood pressure, increased blood speed, and difficult blood clot formation, etc., these are all accumulated bit by bit in the process of observation and research, and many are constantly improved based on patient feedback.

### 打针可以不痛

    打针可以不痛
    卫生部直属机关第二医院护士　梁洁莲
    打针是否能够做到不痛的问题，长时期以来没有得到合理的解答。一般医务人员认为打针需要刺破皮肤，同时还要把药液注入人体组织或血管中，说它不痛是不对的。一般人听说打针，也感到恐惧。打针究竟痛不痛呢？我亲身的经验证明，打针可以做到不痛。几年来，我用我从工作中总结出来的方法，给不少人作过皮下、肌肉、静脉注射、自血疗法和抽血等处置，人们反映说不痛，也很少发生血肿、紫斑、疙瘩等现象。1954年健康报曾经介绍过我的注射法，有些医护人员也来参观、学习和采用了我的注射法，也证实了注射可以不痛。
    我的这个注射法概括地说，首先是根据不同病人，不同病情确定注射部位和注射姿式，其次是错开皮肤和下层组织以熟练的技术快速插针；再次是根据药液的刺激性的不同和肌肉组织松紧程度的不同，变换射药速度；最后是迅速拔针，拔针后不去按揉。以上各个环节是相互联系、相互影响着的，不能忽略任何一个环节，不然就收不到应有的效果。我把这一系列的处置方法叫作新注射法。
    新注射法是我的工作经验的初步总结。它是在党的鼓励、支持和帮助下，在病员的密切合作下完成的。
    我作护理工作已经很久了。在工作中经常看见人们在接受注射的时候，总是摒着气，咬着牙准备忍受注射时的疼痛，我想怎样才能消除注射时的疼痛呢？在旧社会里，一个没有进过专门医药学校的人，要想研究解决这个问题，是不会得到社会的支持和鼓励的。
    1950年，我到了重工业部医院（现改为卫生部直属机关第二医院）工作，我才获得了研究改进注射法的机会。我把注射时的一些片断的问题综合成一个问题来进行研究。首先我研究按揉和内在瘢痕性疙瘩的关系问题。过去，我一直认为注射以后加以按揉可以加速药液的扩散，促进组织对药液的吸收。但是，事实上按揉却引起了疙瘩和经年不散的硬块。为了解决这个问题，我一方面阅读有关的护理书籍，一方面广泛收集和了解病人注射各种药前后的情况，同时把自己亲手处置过的病人作详细记录。这样，经过一段时期，终于找出了产生疙瘩和经年不散的硬块的原因（这里所说的不是过敏性的疙瘩和染菌性的红肿）。注射后常见的疙瘩有两种：一种是由于注射药液的密度较大，部分或大部分药液不能及时扩散，堵塞了组织间隙，阻碍了四围体液的循环，形成疙瘩。另一种是因为注射针插入皮内组织的时候，破坏了毛细血管、或较大的微血管，内出血较多，血和药液混合后起了生物化学变化，药液被血凝结成为不易扩散的疙瘩，这两种疙瘩一般经过两天到四天即可消失，个别的经过两三个星期也会消失。但是，如果在注射后加以按揉，不仅扩大了针道创面，引起较大的内出血，而且使组织间隙壁受到严重的挤伤，甚至挤破、挤断了一些微血管，使得组织间的渗透和输送功能受到阻碍，药液不能自行消散，以至体内胶元素纤维不断增生加厚，结果留下了经年不散的内在瘢痕性疙瘩。根据这些实际的观察和分析，我想：减少内出血、防止插针创口的扩大和保护组织间渗透、输送功能的不受阻碍是主要问题。而减少内出血除了不去按揉以外，使被注射者情绪安静，血压平稳，也是一个重要因素。这就要求插针，射药能够做到不痛。
    注射后不按揉比较容易做到，但是，怎样做到插针、射药不痛呢。我除了想到必须选择锋利韧性强的针头，利用排气时流出的药液作润滑剂，以减少针梗的阻力，和使被注射者肌肉松弛外，必须做到插针快，射药速度适度。经过无数次的试验和改进，终于摸索出快速插针和无痛射药的方法，例如皮下注射，按常规作倾斜插针注射，但在插针的时候被注射者总是说痛。有几次我作了快速倾斜插针，病人反映说不痛。这使我领悟到皮层组织较肌肉组织紧密、坚韧，到处密布感受器，插针速度一慢，痛觉反应快。肌肉注射垂直插针我也作过观察和研究，所得到的结果和皮下注射差不多，这使我了解到快速插针是无痛注射的因素之一。后来，在作臀部肌肉注射的时候，全部采用了快速插针，无痛率达到100％，皮下注射的无痛率也达到90％。
    射药痛和不痛我一直是简单地把它归结到药液刺激性的强弱。可是，有几次给病人注射刺激性强的药物，他们又都说不痛。为此，我反复回忆了当时的情况，并且访问了病人，以后才弄清楚，被注射者的姿式正确，和射药速度合适，也是不痛的因素之一。经过一万多人次的注射，我体会到注射刺激性强的药液，射药速度应当慢，使药液慢慢扩散在组织间，使血行及体液有充分时间把药液徐徐吸收带走。例如我在用仙鹤草素作肌肉注射的时候，我是以1毫升25至35秒的速度注射的。皮下注射比肌肉注射的速度一般更慢，因为皮下组织吸收较慢。至于无刺激性的药液，射药速度可以稍快，但也不能让药液挤伤组织。一个病人需要同时注射几种药物的时候，应当按无刺激性，刺激性大的顺序以不同速度注射。我注射含强烈刺激性药液的无痛率一般达到90％以上。从1953年到现在，我已采用这个注射法注射了近7万人次，病人反映良好。
    至于注射的时候必须等皮肤上的酒精干燥后再插针；抽针后应当用无菌干棉球拭去溢出的药液和血；注射前错开皮肤，使插破的上下层组织在注射后立即封闭；待病人平静之后再去注射，以减少因神经紧张，血压增高，血速加快，血拴不易形成的内出血的机会等等，这都是在观察研究过程中一点一滴地积累起来的，有许多还是根据病人的反映不断改进的。（附图片）
