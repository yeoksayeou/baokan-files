Xinhua News Agency, February 25th—The socialist competition among national railway workers to strive for early completion and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan is vigorously underway. In just over a month, railway workers across the country have proposed tens of thousands of initiatives and rationalization proposals, as well as breakthroughs in quotas. By February 18th, workers at the Qiqihar Railway Administration alone had broken quotas by over 30,000 items and proposed 852 rationalization proposals. Currently, almost all train weight standards on railways nationwide have been surpassed by advanced drivers.

Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan said today at a telephone conference attended by leading cadres of the national railway system that the initiatives proposed by the masses in this competition have many different characteristics from the past. First, these initiatives, in accordance with the characteristics of different production departments, put forward a variety of rich content, while all are centrally focused on striving for early completion and over-fulfillment of the goals of the First Five-Year Plan. Therefore, the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual creation of conditions, and joint collaboration is fully embodied in each initiative. For example, after the workers of the First Engineering Bureau of the New Railway proposed that the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway be opened to traffic to Yumen by "August 1st" ahead of schedule, the First Design Institute, responsible for designing this railway, proposed the initiative of submitting drawings in sections in order to submit design documents in a timely manner and ensure construction progress. Second, these initiatives are proposed by the masses on a conscious ideological basis, and the vast majority have clear goals, concrete measures, and focus on the promotion of advanced experience, and mostly meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

In this movement, the advanced ranks of national railway workers are constantly expanding. The originally advanced have become more advanced, and those who were originally backward, some have become active, and some are catching up with the advanced. Therefore, the backward side has shrunk a lot compared to before. According to a survey and statistics of the railway departments in the Fengtai area in 145 groups, the original 35 advanced groups have now risen to 68; the original 80 intermediate groups have now fallen to 63; and the original 30 backward groups have now fallen to 14.

The ideology and actions of engineering and technical personnel have also changed. In the design departments, many engineering and technical personnel have proposed various initiatives to improve design efficiency, and many have gone deep into the masses to help workers summarize advanced experience and have played a positive role.

At the meeting, Teng Daiyuan also analyzed the basic reasons for the vigorous development of the movement and pointed out the shortcomings and directions of effort of leading cadres in leading the development of the movement.

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th—From February 1st to 20th, in 20 days, train drivers on national railways hauled more than 2.33 million tons of goods beyond quotas. If the weight of the vehicles themselves is added, they hauled a total of more than 3.56 million tons. Since February, train drivers have been able to haul an extra 180,000 tons beyond quotas almost every day. During the Spring Festival, when the number of passengers increased and the number of freight trains decreased, train drivers were still able to haul more than 170,000 tons beyond quotas every day.

    全国铁路职工在竞赛中的创举成千上万
    火车司机在20天中多拉了233万吨货物
    据新华社25日讯　全国铁路职工争取提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的社会主义竞赛正在蓬勃开展。在短短一个多月内，全路职工提出的倡议和合理化建议以及突破定额的各种创举，成千上万。仅齐齐哈尔铁路管理局职工到2月18日已经突破定额30，000多件，提出了852件合理化建议。目前全国各铁路的列车重量标准，几乎全部被先进司机突破了。
    铁道部部长滕代远今天在有全国铁路系统领导干部参加的电话会议上说，这次竞赛中，群众提出的倡议具有许多和以往不同的特点。第一，这些倡议都是按照不同生产部门的特点，提出了多种多样的丰富内容，同时又都是集中地围绕了争取提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的目标。因此，在各个倡议中，充分体现了互相帮助，互创条件，共同协作的精神。如新建铁路第一工程局职工提出了兰新铁路提前在“八一”通车到玉门的倡议以后，负责设计这条铁路的第一设计院就提出了分段交图的倡议，以便及时交出设计文件，保证施工进度。第二，这些倡议是群众在自觉的思想基础上提出的，绝大多数有明确的目标，有具体措施，以推广先进经验为中心内容，并且大都符合又多、又快、又好、又省的要求。
    在这次运动中，全国铁路职工的先进的队伍正在不断地扩大，原来先进的变得更先进了，原来落后的，一部分积极起来了，一部分正在赶上先进的。因而落后面比以前缩小了很多。根据丰台地区铁路部门在145个小组中的调查统计，原来先进的小组是35个，现在上升为68个；中间的小组原有80个，现在下降为63个；落后的小组原为30个，现在下降为14个。
    工程技术人员的思想行动也有了变化。在设计部门，不少工程技术人员提出了各种提高设计效率的倡议，不少工程技术人员深入群众，帮助工人总结先进经验，发挥了积极作用。
    会上，滕代远还分析了运动蓬勃发展的基本原因，并且指出了领导干部在领导运动发展中的缺点和努力方向。
    据新华社25日讯　从2月1日到20日20天内，全国铁路火车司机在定额以外多拉了233万多吨货物。如果再加上车辆本身的重量，他们一共多拉了356万多吨。从2月份开始，火车司机们差不多每天都能在定额以外多拉18万吨。春节期间，在旅客增多和货物列车减少的情况下，火车司机们仍然每天能比定额多拉17万多吨。
