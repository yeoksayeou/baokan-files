The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has submitted the draft directive of the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the USSR for consideration by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Before discussing the objectives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to provide a detailed account of the results of the Fifth Five-Year Plan and to address some fundamental issues in our economic policy.

Comrade Khrushchev, in his report to the Central Committee, vividly described the achievements of our country since the 19th Party Congress. This period included a significant portion of the previous five-year plan. This report not only deeply analyzed the international environment and domestic situation of the USSR and the activities of our Party but also, at the appropriate time, correctly and timely raised and deeply and comprehensively explored extremely important issues of Marxism-Leninism—issues of peaceful coexistence of the socialist and capitalist world systems, the possibility of avoiding war in the present era, and the forms of transition to socialism in different countries.

The great Lenin left us an invaluable legacy of thought; he determined the methods and ways of building a new social system. However, he often urged his students not to be passive custodians of the Party's intellectual heritage but to creatively develop, enrich, and scientifically summarize the experience of the masses building communism through an analysis of new conditions and historical facts in social development.

From the perspective of scientific justification of policy, Lenin considered it absolutely necessary to have an accurate and objective assessment of the balance of class forces and the specific features of each historical moment. In his famous "On Strategy" written in April 1917, Lenin criticized those who clung to old theoretical claims and formulas, looking only backward and not forward; he pointed out: "...one must grasp this indisputable truth, namely, that Marxists must consider living life, actual facts, and not cling to the theories of yesterday; such theories, like any other, can at best indicate basic and general points and can only approximately grasp the complex life." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 24, p. 26)

The great strength of Marxism-Leninism lies in its ability to advance with life and to answer the new questions posed by the process of social development. For Lenin and the Leninists, Marxist theory is always a guide to action, not a dogma.

From the perspective of Lenin's basic requirement, the report of the Central Committee is a bold example of elucidating the urgent problems of Marxism-Leninism, which are of great theoretical and practical importance to our Party and the fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties in the current situation.

The report of the Central Committee provides a broad program for the future work of our Party, a program permeated with a deep and steadfast confidence in the victory of the great cause for which we strive—the cause of communism. During the discussion of this report, everyone's opinions were unanimous, and all enthusiastically supported the political line and practical work of the Central Committee, which proved the rock-solid unity and strength of our Party.

The Central Committee has accomplished effective work in the past few years, which is due to the Central Committee's unwavering adherence to Lenin's instructions on implementing collective leadership within our Party.

The Central Committee and its Presidium resolutely condemned the practice of personality cult, which is incompatible with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and implemented the principle of collective leadership in making all decisions, whether they concern international politics, domestic conditions of our country, or problems within our Party. All important decisions were made on the basis of thorough and critical exchange of opinions.

Adherence to the Leninist principles of collective leadership and the norms of Party life will also ensure that the Party does not make serious mistakes in the future and will guarantee us new achievements in the construction of communism.

The source of the strength of our Party lies in its inseparable connection with the broad masses. The Soviet people know that the Party now and always puts the welfare of the people and the prosperity of our great motherland above everything else. This is the reason why the Soviet people have unlimited trust in their Party and follow the Party with unwavering confidence along the path of victorious communist construction.

In the eyes of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, there is no higher praise for its activities than the unlimited trust and support of the broad masses of the people. On the other hand, the trust of the people imposes a great responsibility on us. Our duty is not to be complacent about our achievements, not to be self-satisfied and contented, but to work better and to maintain closer ties with the people.

Due to the selfless labor of the heroic Soviet people and the great organizational work of our Party, we have achieved great successes in the development of all sectors of the national economy. The directives of the 19th Party Congress on the Fifth Five-Year Plan have been successfully completed and, in many important aspects, even exceeded.

If we say that we have not easily and simply achieved this great victory without effort and struggle against difficulties, that would be wrong. The Party exposed significant shortcomings in economic construction—especially in industry and, to an even greater extent, in agriculture. It boldly and openly told the people about these shortcomings, arousing the great creative and initiative forces of the masses to eliminate these shortcomings more quickly and to bring out the enormous internal potential existing in the various sectors of the socialist national economy.

Relying on the labor initiative of our glorious working class and our engineering and technical personnel, the Party, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, ensured a further powerful rise of socialist industry. The task of increasing industrial production was completed ahead of schedule—in four years and four months. As in all previous five-year plans, our economic development was based on the priority development of heavy industry, with the production of heavy industry increasing to a greater extent than the targets set by the five-year plan. The targets for the production of consumer goods were also exceeded.

In the past five-year plan period, agriculture developed more slowly than stipulated in the directives of the 19th Party Congress, and the agricultural targets of the five-year plan were not completed. In 1955, thanks to the measures planned by the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, agricultural production began to increase. We now have every reason to believe that we have created the necessary conditions for rapid progress in this important sector of the national economy.

The five-year plan targets for railway, sea, and automobile transport turnover were exceeded. The five-year plan for basic investments in the national economy was completed. Investments increased year by year, thereby laying the foundation for the continued expansion of social production and the improvement of the living standards of the people.

The targets for national income, actual wages of workers, employees, and other workers, and the income of collective farmers were exceeded in the five-year plan, and the plan for retail trade was exceeded. Last year, the turnover of retail trade goods was more than twice that of 1940. In these five years, retail prices were reduced by 26%, exceeding the targets set in the directives of the 19th Party Congress.

In the past five-year period, the scale of housing construction was very large. Using government funds allocated according to the plan, 105 million square meters of residential space were built. In addition, a large number of houses were built using funds from enterprises and other non-central funds, as well as by urban residents with their own money or with the help of government loans. In these five years, collective farmers and rural intellectuals built more than two million houses. Although the housing problem remains acute, domestic housing facilities have expanded significantly.

In the past five years, great achievements have been made in the field of culture. The directive of the 19th Party Congress to transition to universal secondary education in the capitals of the republics and large cities has been basically implemented. Our higher educational institutions have trained a large number of specialists.

The science of the USSR has achieved further great successes and has played a greater role in economic and cultural development. The prestige of our science in the international arena has increased, and contacts between Soviet scientists and scientists from other countries have expanded and strengthened.

According to the Fifth Five-Year Plan, many new hospitals, sanatoriums, rest homes, and children's welfare institutions were established. During this period, the birth rate in our country was high, and the death rate continuously decreased, now reduced to less than half of the 1940 death rate.

In foreign trade, the USSR continued to pursue a policy of expanding economic relations with all countries on a mutually beneficial basis. Last year, our foreign trade turnover was approximately twice that of 1950. We expanded and strengthened trade relations with the people's democratic countries. In 1955, our trade turnover with these countries reached 19.5 billion rubles, compared to 10.6 billion rubles in 1950.

Trade with some capitalist countries was conducted under unfavorable conditions. The United States, as well as several Western European countries under American pressure, implemented discriminatory measures to limit and even stop trade with the USSR. Despite this, many capitalist countries are very interested in selling their goods to us and buying goods from us, and our trade with them has not only not decreased but has significantly increased.

Due to the effective implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, our country has taken a big step forward in the gradual transition from socialism to communism. The economic and defensive power of the Soviet state has been greatly strengthened, and its international position has been strengthened.

During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the USSR not only achieved outstanding results in economic and cultural development but also in the implementation of its peaceful foreign policy, in efforts to ease international tensions, and in promoting world peace.

The great socialist camp has become stronger and more united. Countries that have embarked on the socialist path are successfully developing their economies according to government plans. The great Chinese people are enthusiastically and vigorously implementing their first five-year plan.

The European people's democratic countries—Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic—are completing and exceeding their long-term development plans. The Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have made significant progress in developing their economies.

The people of Yugoslavia are advancing victoriously along the path of socialist construction.

The achievements of the Fifth Five-Year Plan have brought great joy to the Soviet people, to our loyal friends—the working people of the socialist camp countries—and to the entire progressive humanity. These achievements are the result of the great and active efforts of the hardworking Soviet people under the inspiration and leadership of the Communist Party headed by the Leninist Central Committee.

(1) The main tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan

A famous directive left by V.I. Lenin states that without a long-term plan aimed at ensuring significant achievements, it is impossible to work. Our practice in drafting and implementing five-year plans follows this directive.

Life has shown that our plans are feasible. Every five years, the USSR raises its economic development to a higher level, becomes richer, and its international prestige increases. The superiority of the socialist planned economy allows us to set increasingly greater tasks for ourselves in economic and cultural construction.

At the beginning of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the USSR possesses a powerful, comprehensive socialist production system, abundant material resources, and, most importantly, a large number of skilled workers in both cities and villages.

Since our country possesses a powerful heavy industry, it has all the conditions not only to rapidly develop the production of means of production but also to rapidly develop the production of consumer goods, thereby greatly increasing its social wealth and advancing further on the path to building a communist society.

The main task of the Sixth Five-Year Plan of the USSR is: on the basis of the priority development of heavy industry, continuous improvement of technology, and increase in labor productivity, to further vigorously develop all sectors of the national economy, rapidly develop agricultural production, and on this basis, significantly raise the material and cultural level of the Soviet people.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan is based on science and meets the needs of the objective economic laws governing the development of the socialist mode of production.

As before, industry—mainly heavy industry, that is, the production of means of production—will play a leading role in the development of the socialist economy. Without relatively rapid development of heavy industry, it is impossible to ensure the expanded reproduction of all sectors of the national economy.

If heavy industry is not developed on a priority basis, it will be impossible to ensure the expanded reproduction in all sectors of the national economy, to ensure the continuous improvement of technology, the continuous rise of productive forces, and the continuous increase in labor productivity, to ensure that our country has an invincible defensive capability, and to improve the material well-being of the people. This is what Marxist-Leninist political economy teaches, and it is proven by the entire history of the development of our socialist state.

Due to the resolute and continuous implementation of the Leninist general line of priority development of heavy industry, we have achieved a historic victory, which is that we have transformed our formerly backward agrarian country into a leading industrial power with highly mechanized large-scale agriculture, built a socialist society, and are confidently advancing step by step towards communism.

The unprecedentedly rapid development of technology in all sectors of production is a characteristic of our era. The 19th century was mainly the era of steam, while the 20th century, the era of electricity, is beginning to transition to the era of atomic energy, which holds boundless potential for the development of productive forces. We communists must make the greatest discovery of the 20th century—atomic energy—fully serve our Party's ultimate programmatic goal—the cause of building communism. In the peaceful use of atomic energy, our country is ahead of other countries. We must continue to consolidate this leading role in the future.

Regarding the acceleration of technological progress in industry and the increase in labor productivity, it is known that this issue was raised very sharply at the July Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year. The decisions of the Plenary Session are also reflected in the draft directive of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, where the task of ensuring rapid technological progress in all sectors of the national economy and, on this basis, the maximum increase in labor productivity is set forth.

One of the main tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan is to achieve a sharp rise in agriculture.

To fully meet the growing needs of the population for grain and the needs of light and food industries for raw materials, we must develop agriculture much faster than in the Fifth Five-Year Plan. We should sharply increase the production of grain, industrial raw materials, potatoes, vegetables, and livestock products.

The further large-scale development of industry, agriculture, transportation, trade, and the entire national economy, the rapid progress of technology, and the increase in labor productivity are the main conditions that will enable us to successfully achieve the main goal of socialist production in the new five-year plan, which is to continuously improve the material well-being and cultural level of the people. The implementation of the new five-year plan will be an important stage in solving the basic economic tasks of the USSR, which is to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of production per capita in a historically short period of time and in peaceful economic competition.

The source of this problem lies in the fact that the entire socio-economic system of pre-revolutionary Russia, dominated by landlords and capitalists, was historically far behind the advanced countries of that time.

Long before the October Revolution, Lenin, in an article titled "The Impending Catastrophe and How to Avoid It," sharply emphasized the need to catch up with and surpass the most developed countries in the economic sphere. After the socialist revolution, this task was reflected in Lenin's series of directives on the development of heavy industry, which Lenin considered necessary for the rise of the entire productive forces of the state and for transforming our motherland into an economically powerful country.

After the implementation of the first two five-year plans, the USSR had already become an advanced industrial country, ranking second in the world in terms of total industrial output. This created the conditions for the 18th Party Congress, convened on March 1939, to set the task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in the economic sphere, that is, in terms of industrial output per capita.

The attack by Hitler's Germany on the USSR and the heavy burden of war imposed on us caused great losses to our national economy, interrupting the solution of this basic economic task for ten to eleven years.

Now, when our economy has not only recovered to the pre-war level but has also advanced far beyond it, the people of our country will solve the basic economic task under conditions different from those before the Second World War. Now the environment is different and more favorable for us. The material and technical base of the USSR has been greatly strengthened. Just one example can illustrate this: last year, the total industrial output of our country increased to three and a half times that of 1939 (the year in which the basic economic task was actually proposed). The USSR, due to its increasing economic strength year by year, has already far surpassed the most developed capitalist countries in Europe in terms of absolute production.

Of course, when our Party proposed the task of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in the economic sphere, it took into account the fact that the economies of these countries had not stood still after the war. In the United States, industrial output has approximately doubled compared to the pre-war period. The production of other capitalist countries has also increased. We know that this growth is determined by some temporary factors, it is one-sided and very unstable, and the main increase in production is in those industrial sectors that have some connection with the militarization of the economy. It cannot eliminate the main contradictions inherent in the capitalist mode of production and, on the contrary, is making these contradictions more acute. All this is indisputable. However, we must clearly understand that to complete the basic economic task of the USSR, we must significantly expand the scale of production growth compared to the pre-war period.

The distinctive feature of the current stage in solving the basic economic task of the USSR is that, unlike the pre-war period, now our country is solving this task in a great historical era in which it is not just one socialist country competing with the capitalist world, but two world systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system—competing in peaceful economic competition.

Almost half of the population of Europe and Asia has finally and completely freed itself from capitalism. More than one-third of humanity has firmly embarked on the path of socialist construction. This fact has immense world-historical significance.

Countries that have joined the world socialist economic system, of course, have their own characteristics in economic development, which are derived from the past history of each country and the specific conditions of each country. However, the countries of the socialist camp, despite their specific characteristics, have a common point in fundamental and main aspects. This common point is that all these countries are advancing along the path to socialism and communism; in all these countries, the working class, allied with the peasantry and led by a Marxist party, is in power.

The economic relations between the sovereign countries of the socialist camp are based on mutual friendship and cooperation. This cooperation is broad and diverse. It is expressed in the most rational use of economic resources and production capacities for the common good, in the coordination of development plans for the various sectors of the national economy, in the specialization and cooperation of production, in the exchange of scientific and technical achievements and advanced production experience. This friendly cooperation and mutual assistance are the source of the growing and continuously strengthening economic power of the world socialist system, which has freed itself from crises, unemployment, and other incurable diseases inherent in the capitalist system.

As a result of the Second World War, a series of countries have left the capitalist system, significantly reducing the scope of capitalist relations.

The significance is especially great that we are witnessing the collapse of the imperialist colonial system, which Lenin had very acutely predicted as inevitable.

Thus, in the economic competition with capitalism, the USSR and the entire socialist camp possess enormous advantages. The decisive advantage lies in the fact that the socialist economic system provides extensive possibilities for the development of technology, productive forces, and for the manifestation of the genius and abilities of millions of laborers—the creators of all material and spiritual wealth of society. To make the most of these enormous, truly limitless possibilities, it is necessary to resolutely improve and perfect the work of the Party, Soviets, and economic bodies in leading industry, transportation, and agriculture. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin had ardently hoped that at our congresses, there would be more engineers and agronomists speaking, that the congresses and meetings would become places for checking economic achievements, where we could learn well about economic construction. The Party and the Soviet people have already realized this desire of Lenin's.

Comrades, look at our congress, look at the spirit of concreteness and practicality in the discussion of the report of the Central Committee, look at how carefully the representatives discuss some practical problems in industrial and agricultural work in their speeches.

This is related to the great organizational work carried out by the Party and the Central Committee, which in recent years has made great efforts to call on our cadres to shift their attention to production-economic issues, to the study of advanced experience, and to the large-scale promotion of this experience. More concretely! This principle of Lenin's is now more decisive than ever. This is the central link in our entire economic leadership work at present.

The Communist Party and the entire Soviet people are convinced that in the historical competition between the two systems, the more advanced socialist system will inevitably win. However, victory, of course, will not come by itself. To achieve victory, we must continue to develop the national economy at a high speed in the future, stay ahead of other countries in technological improvement and increasing labor productivity, and continuously improve our daily organizational work.

The completion of the tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will raise the economic power of the USSR to a higher level and will also promote the further development of the economies of the great socialist camp countries, strengthening the entire world socialist economic system.

(2) Development of the national economy of the USSR in the Sixth Five-Year Plan

Industrial tasks

The further rise of all sectors of the national economy primarily depends on the rapid development of socialist industry.

The draft directive stipulates that industrial production will increase by 65% during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This means that by 1960, the last year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, our industrial production will increase to three times that of 1950 and 5.3 times that of the pre-war year 1940.

The most important task of the Sixth Five-Year Plan in industry is to first promote the development of black and non-ferrous metals, petroleum, coal, and chemical industries, to ensure the especially rapid construction of power stations, and to rapidly develop the machine-building industry, particularly increasing the production of technically advanced machine tools, forging and pressing machines, automatic tools, and instruments. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the production of means of production (first category) will increase by approximately 70%. The production of means of production compared to 1940 will increase to 6.6 times.

Due to the powerful development of heavy industry and the rapid improvement of agricultural production, it is possible to accelerate the development of the industrial sectors producing consumer goods.

The production of consumer goods will increase by approximately 60%. By 1960, the production of consumer goods (second category) will increase to 3.5 times that of 1940.

By 1960, when the Sixth Five-Year Plan is completed, the USSR will produce more steel, electricity, cement, and fuel than the current total production of these items in Britain, France, and West Germany. In terms of total industrial output, the USSR will be significantly closer to the level of the United States.

Our Party has always and continues to attach great importance to the black metallurgy industry because the development of all sectors of the national economy ultimately depends on it.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, we propose the task of significantly raising the existing production level of black metals. In 1960, our country will produce approximately 53 million tons of pig iron, which is 3.6 times that of 1940; 68.3 million tons of steel, which is 3.7 times that of 1940; and 52.7 million tons of steel products, which is 4 times that of 1940.

However, the issue is not just about increasing the production of black metals. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, metallurgists should rapidly increase the production of alloy steel, low-alloy steel, electric furnace steel, and other high-quality metals, which have significant national economic and defense significance. The variety of metal products should be greatly expanded, and the most economical types of steel should be increased. All this will help to more effectively utilize metal resources, reduce the weight of machines and metal structures, and produce more advanced equipment.

During the period of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, metallurgists made great efforts to obtain more metal using existing continuous casting machines. This produced good results, but it should not be forgotten that there is still more potential in the black metal industry.

By simply better utilizing existing production capacities, modernizing obsolete equipment, and improving production processes, metallurgical workers can, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, produce for the state more than one-third of the planned increase in pig iron and about half of the planned increase in steel.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, attention will also be paid to the development of the non-ferrous metallurgy industry.

New power stations and power grids, communication cables, batteries, railway electrification, and other needs of the national economy require a large amount of copper, lead, aluminum. To further develop the production of high-pressure steam turbines, gas turbines, and other machines that use alloy steel and heat-resistant alloys, it is necessary to increase the production of nickel, tungsten, molybdenum, niobium, and other non-ferrous and rare metals. According to the draft directive, during the new five-year plan, the production of non-ferrous and rare metals should be rapidly developed. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the average annual increase in the production of non-ferrous metals should be significantly higher than in previous five-year plans.

To increase the production of non-ferrous and rare metals, it is necessary to develop mining bases, improve the comprehensive use of raw materials, and ensure more complete extraction of metals from ores.

An important task for workers in the non-ferrous metallurgy industry is to increase the production of high-purity non-ferrous and rare metals because the development of electronics, radio engineering, and the production of heat-resistant alloys require these metals.

Fuel industry

In 1955, coal accounted for 65% of our fuel production, petroleum for 22.5%, and natural gas for 2.5%. It can be seen that petroleum, especially natural gas, accounts for a small proportion of fuel production. However, natural gas and petroleum are the cheapest and most effective fuels. For example, the cost of extracting natural gas is one-eighth of the cost of coal mining. In addition, petroleum and natural gas are valuable raw materials for obtaining many chemicals.

Therefore, the policy of accelerating the development of the petroleum and natural gas industries has been adopted. The draft directive stipulates that the coal production in 1960 should increase by 52% compared to 1955, petroleum production by 91%, and natural gas by approximately four times. Now the USSR has a powerful and technically well-equipped coal industry.

However, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the coal industry lagged behind the requirements of the national economy, causing difficulties in fuel supply to industry and transportation. In the European part of the USSR, there is a particularly acute need for coal and a shortage of coal production.

The plan is to mine 59.3 million tons of coal in 1960, which is 1.5 times that of 1955. This is a very significant task, the completion of which will not only meet the national economy's demand for coal but will also increase the state's coal reserves.

To greatly reduce the amount of long-distance coal transportation from the eastern regions to the European part of the state, it is stipulated to more rapidly develop the coal industry in the Donbas. The Donbas will continue to play an extremely important role in ensuring the state's fuel supply. In 1960, the coal production in the Donbas will reach 21.2 million tons, which is 7.7 million tons more than in 1955. However, since the coal in the Donbas is expensive, more difficult to mine, and has high costs, it is necessary, while further developing the coal industry in the Donbas, to also utilize other sources to expand and strengthen the power base of Ukraine.

This raises the question of utilizing as much as possible the coal and natural gas resources available in Ukraine.

In addition to the existing Dnieper and Kakhovka hydroelectric stations, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Kremenchug and Dnieper-Dnipropetrovsk hydroelectric stations will be built, and the construction of the Kanev power station will begin. It is also stipulated to vigorously develop the production of natural gas in Western Ukraine.

The government has instructed the State Planning Commission to further study the issue of utilizing Ukraine's water resources. It may be necessary to take some additional measures in this regard.

The utilization of water resources and the extraction of natural gas in Ukraine have great national economic significance because this will expand the state's fuel and power resources, making it possible to replace a large amount of expensive Donbas coal with cheaper fuels.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, many new industrial enterprises and power stations will be built in the eastern part of the state, and new railways will be laid. Therefore, the demand for coking coal and power coal will greatly increase.

The coal reserves in these regions are extremely abundant. Compared to the European part of the USSR, mining here can obtain cheaper coal with less investment, and many mines can be mined by open-pit methods. The current task is to vigorously develop the coal industry in the Kuznetsk coal basin, the Karaganda coal basin, and other coal basins in the east.

The coal production in 1960 should reach 13.5 million tons, which is 4.5 times that of 1940.

In the past few five-year plans, we have created the necessary conditions for the further rapid development of the petroleum industry. Many new large oil fields have been discovered and are being mined, resulting in the industrial reserves of oil increasing to more than four times the pre-war level. A powerful petroleum machinery industry has been established, which can ensure the supply of technically advanced equipment to the petroleum industry.

In the Urals, especially in the Volga region, extremely rich oil fields are being effectively mined. In 1960, the oil obtained in these regions will account for 75% of the total oil production in the country.

It is beneficial for us to rapidly develop the petroleum industry in the Urals and the Volga region. The cost of mining oil in these regions is one-third to three-quarters lower than in the old oil regions.

However, our policy of rapidly developing oil production in the eastern regions of the state does not mean that we can reduce attention to the old oil regions—Baku and Grozny, which produce the best types of oil for the state.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, we should pay special attention to the large-scale development of the oil refining industry and build large-scale refineries in this regard, with a production capacity two to four times that of the refineries built so far. This will make the construction of refineries much cheaper and faster.

The important task of increasing oil production requires the widespread development of oil and oil product transportation through pipelines.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates the construction of more than 14,500 kilometers of main oil pipelines. The proportion of oil transportation in the total weight of oil transported will increase by one and a half times in five years.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the natural gas industry will be vigorously developed. In five years, the gas production will increase to 40 billion cubic meters. New gas fields in Stavropol, near Kharkov in Shebelino, and near Saratov in Stepnov will be put into industrial production, and the gas field in Berizov downstream of the Ob River will be prepared for production. A total of approximately 9,000 kilometers of gas pipelines will also be built.

Electrification

The Central Committee of the Party tirelessly implements Lenin's instructions on the electrification of the entire country.

In 1955, the total power stations of the USSR produced 170 billion kWh, which is 3.5 times that of 1940. However, the demand for electricity was only barely met.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the power stations should increase their electricity generation as quickly as possible to fully meet the continuously growing demand for electricity in the national economy and to create a reserve of generating capacity. Over five years, it is stipulated that industrial total production will increase by 65%, while electricity should increase by 88%, and the generating capacity of power stations should increase to 2.2 times.

Our country has abundant water resources. The advantage of hydroelectric stations is that they do not require fuel and can supply the cheapest electricity.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, great attention will be paid to the construction of hydroelectric stations. The generating capacity of hydroelectric stations will increase to 2.7 times during the five-year plan.

The European part of the USSR will continue to utilize the water resources of the Volga and Kama rivers. In addition to completing the Kuibyshev, Gorky, Stalingrad, Molotov, and Votkinsk hydroelectric stations, the Saratov and Cheboksary hydroelectric stations will be built on the Volga River, and the Lower Kama hydroelectric station will be built on the Kama River.

Siberia will launch large-scale construction of giant hydroelectric stations—the Bratsk hydroelectric station on the Angara River and the Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric station on the Yenisei River. These two hydroelectric stations each have a generating capacity of 3.2 million kW, and each hydroelectric station generates as much electricity per year as the total generation of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric stations. It is planned to use the cheap electricity from the Siberian power stations to organize some power-intensive production.

As for the production of thermal power stations, the task of building powerful power stations is proposed here, which will install 100,000, 150,000, and 200,000 kW turbo-generators, using high-pressure and high-temperature steam for production. Such large power stations are more economical than power stations with smaller generating capacities. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, a large number of power grids will be built. In the early years of the development of Soviet power, the connection of power stations into grids, so-called interconnection, was only carried out in individual regions. Subsequently, the power systems of the regions were interconnected, and interregional power systems were established.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, a significant and major task is proposed—to establish a unified power system for the entire European part of the USSR, which will use 400,000 volt transmission lines to connect the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric stations with the power systems of the central, southern, and Ural regions.

In 1960, the electricity generated by the power stations connected into the unified power system of the European part of the USSR will be approximately half of the total electricity generated in the USSR at that time.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, a unified power system will begin to be established in the central part of Siberia. This system will connect the hydroelectric stations on the Angara and Yenisei rivers with the thermal and hydroelectric power stations in Kuzbass, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, and Krasnoyarsk.

The establishment of a unified power system can more reliably ensure the supply of electricity, greatly improve the economy of power stations, make it possible to build some giant power stations to replace many uneconomical medium and small power stations, and electrify many new areas that are currently short of electricity.

A prominent feature of the Sixth Five-Year Plan is the widespread construction and utilization of atomic power stations. The draft directive stipulates the construction of several atomic power stations with a total generating capacity of 2 to 2.5 million kW, which is almost one and a half times the total capacity of all power stations built according to the famous All-Russian Electrification Plan.

Chemical industry

The role and significance of chemistry in the various sectors of industry and agriculture are becoming increasingly important. The rapid development of the chemical industry has long been a necessary condition for technological progress.

The current state of the chemical industry cannot satisfy us, so the Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates the acceleration of the development of the chemical industry. One of the most important tasks of this sector is to increase the production of mineral fertilizers that can improve the yield per unit area of crops. By 1960, the production of mineral fertilizers will increase to approximately 20 million tons, which is 6.5 times that of 1940 and more than twice that of 1955.

It is necessary to organize the production of new, more effective chemical agents for the prevention and control of crop pests and diseases, as well as the large-scale production of herbicides to greatly reduce the labor required for weeding crop fields.

An important task for the chemical industry is to widely develop the production of synthetic alcohol, synthetic rubber, solvents, paints, high-quality soap substitutes, and other chemicals made from petroleum, coal gas, and natural gas. Now we use grain, potatoes, and edible oils to produce these products. After using petroleum, coal gas, and natural gas to produce synthetic products in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it will be possible to greatly reduce and eventually completely stop the use of grain and vegetable oils in industrial consumption.

The workers of the chemical industry should vigorously develop the production of raw materials necessary for the manufacture of artificial silk, footwear, and clothing. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the production of synthetic materials for the manufacture of artificial fibers is planned to increase to approximately six times.

It is necessary to expand the variety and increase the production of synthetic materials for machine building, radio components, and aviation, as well as to develop the production of high-quality insulating materials and plastics, because the use of these materials can reduce the weight of machines and parts and save non-ferrous metals.

The national economy also urgently needs automobile tires. The draft directive stipulates an increase in the production of automobile tires by one-fold, and the workers of the chemical industry should consider this as the minimum task.

The development of black and non-ferrous metallurgy, fuel, and chemical industries requires a strong raw material base. Our mining industry has abundant and already explored mineral deposits. According to the already explored reserves of iron ore, manganese, copper, lead, iron ore, nickel, tungsten, potash, and phosphate, the USSR ranks first in the world.

Due to the extensive geological exploration work, large quantities of new coal mines, petroleum mines, black metals, non-ferrous metals, and rare metals, as well as other mineral deposits, have been discovered. Now, on the basis of these deposits, we are building large enterprises for our heavy industry.

We should commend our geologists. They worked well in the previous five-year plan and achieved good results. For example, in the Kostanay region, new large iron ore deposits, power coal, and iron ore deposits were discovered, which are very suitable for industrial mining. The following point alone is sufficient to illustrate the great significance of this discovery: according to the materials of the Geology and Mineral Protection Department, the iron ore reserves in the Kostanay region exceed the explored iron ore reserves in the Urals, including Magnitogorsk.

The directive stipulates the establishment of the iron ore industry based on the deposits in Kostanay, with an annual production of 10 million tons of iron ore, the construction of a large iron ore mine, an aluminum plant, and the large-scale mining of power coal.

In the southern regions of the Yakut Autonomous Republic and the eastern regions of Lake Baikal, new large deposits of coking coal and iron ore have been discovered.

The discovery of large deposits of gold and diamonds in the Yakut Autonomous Republic is a significant achievement in recent years.

It is necessary to further explore and prospect for new deposits of petroleum, natural gas, coking coal, black metals, non-ferrous metals, and rare metals, as well as other minerals in various economic regions, especially in the eastern part of our country. This is necessary to achieve a more balanced distribution of the mining industry and to be able to ensure the long-term production of enterprises that are currently under construction and in operation using the mineral reserves that have been discovered.

Machine-building industry

At the July Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year, several machine-building departments were severely and completely justly criticized for their backwardness in the design and production of technically advanced equipment and instruments.

The development of the machine-building industry, especially the machine-tool industry and the tool industry, should be ahead of other industrial sectors. Therefore, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the production of the machine-building and metalworking industries is stipulated to increase by 80%.

The machine-building industry faces a huge task in the new five-year plan. It is necessary to produce highly efficient new equipment in a short period of time to equip machine-building factories. This primarily refers to metal-cutting machine tools, forging and pressing machines, casting machines, automatic and semi-automatic production lines.

In five years, the production of metal-cutting machine tools is expected to nearly double. In the total production of machine tools, at least half should be the most advanced cutting machine tools. For example, the production of multi-spindle automatic lathes, which can simultaneously process workpieces with many cutting tools, is expected to increase to nearly two and a half times, and the production of automatic and semi-automatic production lines and equipment for automatic workshops and automatic factories is expected to increase to about five times.

The task is to increase the production of forging and pressing equipment to about two times in the five-year plan, and the production of heavy forging and pressing machines to at least four times. It is necessary to use mechanical forging and pressing machines with several thousand tons of pressure to replace the old free forging hammers, thereby adopting advanced new process specifications, greatly reducing the labor and metal consumption per unit product.

In foundry workshops, the heavy and low-productivity manual labor of molders, foundry workers, and chasers must be replaced by machine work. For this purpose, it is planned to increase the production of modernized foundry equipment to eight times and to build a large number of specialized foundry workshops and factories in various regions of the country.

By re-equipping foundry production on a new technological basis, it will be possible to produce precision castings that require only a small amount of mechanical processing.

This will free up tens of thousands of metal-cutting machine tools and save tens of millions of tons of metal that are currently turned into chips.

The machine-building industry also faces an equally important task in manufacturing more advanced equipment for other sectors of the national economy.

Machine builders should supply the metallurgical industry with various high-productivity, mechanized, and automated machines that reach the best achievements of world technology.

The mining industry and the coal industry will receive new powerful machines. In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, self-propelled scrapers with a bucket capacity of 14 cubic meters were already manufactured. The productivity of these machines is 800 cubic meters per hour. In the new five-year plan, machine builders should supply metallurgical workers, coal miners, and construction workers with larger excavators that can excavate more than 1,200 cubic meters of soil per hour. It is necessary to coordinate the work of these excavators with self-unloading trucks with a load capacity of 40 to 50 tons. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the automobile industry will produce these large self-unloading trucks.

Machine builders will face the complex task of manufacturing extremely large power equipment for thermal power stations. It is necessary to design and produce economical steam turbines with a capacity of 200,000 to 300,000 kW and boilers with a capacity of 900 tons of steam per hour that match these steam turbines. In these turbo-generators, the steam pressure will reach 300 atmospheres, and the steam temperature will reach 650 degrees.

In the past five years, power machine builders manufactured water turbines with a capacity of 105,000 kW for the Kuibyshev hydroelectric station. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, they will manufacture more powerful water turbines. The Bratsk hydroelectric station requires water turbines with a capacity of more than 200,000 kW each. The capacity of these machines can be illustrated by the following comparison: the capacity of five such water turbines is equal to the capacity of all power stations in pre-revolutionary Russia, and the electricity generated by these five water turbines is 3.5 times the total electricity generation of Tsarist Russia.

The draft directive stipulates that the production of steam turbines, water turbines, and gas turbines should be greatly increased in five years, and the production of generators for turbines, including those with a capacity of 300,000 kW and new hydrogen-cooling devices, should also be greatly increased.

When designing and manufacturing machine tools, machines, and various equipment, machine builders should pay special attention to reducing the unit consumption of metal by improving the design of machines, using economic steel, and replacing metal with plastics.

If we do not have a sufficient number of various, diverse, and most advanced instruments and radio engineering components, we will not be able to successfully solve the most important task of automating the production process. Therefore, in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to rapidly develop the instrument-making and radio engineering industries.

To expand the production capacity of the instrument-making industry, 32 specialized factories will be built, and the scientific research and experimental bases will be strengthened.

To improve the management of this industrial sector, the machine and instrument-making part has been divided into two departments—the Instrument-Making and Automation Tools Department and the Machine-Building Department.

The most important and urgent task of the instrument-making industry is to ensure the supply of scientific work and production with a sufficient number of fast electronic computers, which are new tools for automating calculation work and production processes.

The workers of the radio industry should pay special attention to the manufacture of new, high-quality semiconductor instruments, which can already successfully replace radio vacuum tubes in many cases. Semiconductor instruments are much smaller and lighter than radio vacuum tubes, and they improve the reliability of radio machines, electronic computers, and other devices.

Semiconductor instruments are worth serious study. However, the radio industry department is unacceptably slow in mastering the production of these instruments, and the non-ferrous metallurgy department also produces insufficient quantities of highly pure materials for the production of these instruments.

In the past few years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the production of building materials has greatly increased. However, they still cannot fully meet the needs of the national economy. Cement, wall and roofing materials, even window glass, are in short supply.

To build quickly, economically, and well, as everyone now knows, it is necessary to widely adopt factory methods and use more prefabricated reinforced concrete components, which requires a large amount of cement.

In 1940, we produced approximately 60 million tons of cement, in 1955, we exceeded 2,200 million tons, and in 1960, the cement production plan will reach 5,500 million tons, which can be said that the United States produced approximately 5,200 million tons of cement in 1955.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the production of prefabricated reinforced concrete components will increase to approximately six times, and the production of decorative materials, tiles, sanitary equipment, and other building materials will increase to more than two times.

Wood industry

The USSR is the country with the most abundant forests in the world. Our logging operations are being carried out on a large scale. For example, last year, approximately 300 million cubic meters of timber were logged and transported.

However, our timber is still insufficient, mainly because we do not use it economically. There is no country in the world like ours that is so wasteful of timber. In 100 million rubles of construction and installation work, our construction workers consume 480 cubic meters of timber, while, for example, in our friends—the people's democratic countries, this consumption is much less.

To save timber, it is first necessary to more widely adopt concrete and reinforced concrete.

The fundamental reason for the interruption in the supply of timber to the national economy is that the main loggers—the Forestry Department—have continuously failed to complete the plan.

In just the years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, this department has failed to supply the national economy with nearly 80 million cubic meters of industrial timber.

At the same time, both in the past and now, the Forestry Department has always received help in the development of production bases. In the past 5 years, the Forestry Department has received 12.5 billion rubles in investments. The degree of mechanization of the basic logging operations has greatly increased. However, the Forestry Department has done a poor job in mechanizing the auxiliary operations, so many workers in forestry work are still working manually.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the output of industrial timber will increase by 42%, mainly in regions with abundant forests, and the timber processing industry in these regions will be greatly developed.

The most important task of the forest industry is to complete the full mechanization of logging operations and transition to a fixed number of workers working year-round.

The paper and wood processing industries are closely related to the forest industry.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates the construction of new pulp mills, thick paper mills, and the reconstruction of many existing pulp and paper enterprises, thereby greatly increasing the production of pulp and paper. The production of printing paper and newspapers should increase to more than one and a half times, and thick paper should increase to 2.8 times.

Previously, we built pulp mills and paper mills mostly in forest areas and transported large quantities of paper and thick paper to all parts of the country through long-distance transportation. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it is also necessary to build enterprises producing pulp and thick paper in non-forested areas, utilizing the abundant reed resources for production. This will make it possible to greatly increase the production of paper and thick paper in our country and reduce the work of transporting these products to distant places.

The paper industry should widely develop the production of packaging paper to replace about half of the wooden boxes with thick paper boxes in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This will save us approximately 7 million cubic meters of timber per year.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the task of widely developing production in all sectors of light industry and the food industry should be solved. Therefore, in ensuring the uninterrupted trade of industrial goods and food, a great step forward will be made. All conditions for this are in place.

The rapidly developing heavy industry will supply the existing factories and newly built factories of light industry with technically advanced machines, equipment, and devices. On the other hand, the development of all sectors of agriculture will be able to rapidly increase the supply of raw materials to the textile, footwear, food, meat and dairy, canning, and other sectors of light industry and the food industry.

The workers of the food industry should greatly increase the production of meat and meat products, fats, cheese, milk and dairy products, fish and fish products, sugar, confectionery, and various canned goods. Therefore, many new factories will be built in cities and regions purchasing agricultural raw materials.

The workers of enterprises producing industrial consumer goods face an important task. They should expand the production of footwear and sewing products to more than one and a half times, greatly increase the production of linen products, especially high-quality woolen products, which cannot fully meet the current demand. It is necessary to greatly develop the production of artificial fibers and synthetic fibers. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the production of artificial fibers should increase to at least three times, and synthetic fibers to five times.

It is necessary to greatly increase the production of such commodities as: clocks, bicycles, motorcycles, sewing machines, washing machines, radios, and other cultural and household items.

In addition to expanding the production of industrial goods, the workers of light industry should also ensure a great improvement in the quality of products and timely production. It is necessary to enable residents to purchase clothing, shirts, and shoes in a timely manner according to the season.

The workers of all sectors of light industry and the food industry have the responsibility to greatly improve the utilization of production capacity, strive to adopt advanced processes, and greatly reduce the loss of raw materials in production.

Comrades, the basic tasks of various industrial sectors in the Sixth Five-Year Plan are as follows.

Industrial technological progress

In the past few five-year plan years, our industrial production technology has achieved tremendous development. However, we are now far from being able to meet this situation. Technology cannot stand still but must always advance. We can only greatly increase labor productivity and production in a short period of time by widely adopting new technological equipment. Therefore, the tasks set forth in the draft directive for further development of industrial technology are of particular importance.

The July Plenary Session of the Central Committee pointed out that the most important task of the Party, Soviets, and economic bodies in the field of industry, in addition to completing the national economy plan, is to strive to raise the technological level of production and to continuously strive for technological progress.

What does industrial technological progress look like at the present stage?

Technological progress is inseparably linked with electrification and is primarily manifested in the continuous improvement of all machines and equipment, the use of the most advanced production processes, the full mechanization and automation of the entire production process, the most complete and rational use of existing raw materials and power resources, and the continuous increase in the production of high-quality products through all this.

However, technology—machines, lathes, and other equipment—is only one aspect of the matter. To correctly use this technology, to ensure rapid technological progress, it is necessary to constantly pay attention to the work of training highly skilled workers, technicians, engineers, and scientists, to continuously develop science and improve the organization of production.

Many examples can be cited to illustrate our great achievements in technological progress. However, today is not the time to talk about this. Now we should focus our efforts on eliminating the shortcomings in this area and ensuring rapid technological progress in all sectors of the national economy in the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

I will start with our machine and equipment problems.

In the first and second five-year plans, our enterprises were equipped with the most advanced equipment at that time, much of which was imported from abroad. More than 20 years have passed since then. During the war, the scale of new equipment for industry was not large. In the post-war period, new lathes and machines were added to the equipment, but our lathes still have many old lathes, whose speed is 150 to 400 revolutions per minute, while our new lathes have a speed of 1,500 to 2,000 revolutions per minute. We are still lacking semi-automatic machines, automatic machines, new planers, milling machines, and grinding machines, as well as forging and pressing machines.

The foundry equipment of our factories lags behind modern standards. The production capacity of most of the foundry machines equipped by our machine-building industry is only one-third to one-quarter of that of modern semi-automatic and automatic foundry machines.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, we must vigorously replace the metalworking and foundry equipment of the machine-building industry, the technological equipment of light industry and the food industry, the locomotives and rolling stock of transportation, and the tractors and machines of agriculture.

While adopting and installing new equipment, it is also necessary to take decisive measures to modernize existing machines and improve the productivity of existing equipment.

By installing more powerful engines and equipment attachments on machines and machinery that can lighten and speed up work, it is possible to greatly increase the productivity of machine tools and machines. However, the work of modernizing equipment has not reached the necessary scale. The departments and factories supplying equipment have provided little help to the factories that need to modernize their equipment. As a result, the latter often, with their own strength and in a semi-artisan manner, carry out all the work. However, even in this way, they often achieve great results.

For example, after improving the structure of individual parts of semi-automatic lathes that have been working for more than 20 years, the State First Ball Bearing Plant was able to adopt the fast-working method. Thus, the productivity of the machine tools increased by 25%, and the scrap rate was greatly reduced.

Modernizing equipment is a matter of great importance to the state. Party organizations and economic organizations should pay more attention to this issue.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, a great deal of work will also be done in the widespread adoption of new, more advanced production processes.

From the following examples, it can be seen how important this task is.

In the machine-building industry, in some enterprises, steel castings are still made using sand molds, and forgings are made using the outdated, low-productivity method of free forging. Using this process, a large amount of labor is inevitably consumed, and a large amount of chips are produced after machining the parts.

At the same time, in some factories, advanced new casting and forging methods have been adopted, which increase labor productivity several times and save a large amount of metal. However, these new methods are being promoted in production very slowly.

Another example. Now, molten steel is poured into iron molds. The resulting steel ingots are first rolled by roughing mills and then rolled by shape steel mills or sheet steel mills.

However, the "Red Solomovo Plant" and the "New Tula" steel plant have adopted a new method of continuous casting, using which it is possible to obtain steel billets for the manufacture of steel directly from molten steel, and to omit the operations of casting steel ingots in casting molds and rolling in roughing mills.

If by 1960, the continuous casting of steel ingots reaches 12 to 15 million tons (which is completely realistic), then according to the statistics of the State Committee for New Technology, the production of steel products can be increased by approximately 100 million tons, and in this regard, approximately 2 billion rubles can be saved.

The value of the additional equipment required for continuous casting can be recovered in less than a year. In addition, it is possible to eliminate the heavy manual labor of workers in the casting shops, reduce the number of workers in the casting shops, and reduce the expenditure on refractory materials.

Another example. In black metallurgy enterprises, the vast majority of tinplate is produced by the old, non-mechanized method, which requires about 40 man-hours per ton of tinplate for hot rolling, cutting, and sorting, and 20 kilograms of tin per ton of tinplate for hot tinning. However, the Zaporozhye Steel Plant has mastered a more advanced process, which can ensure a reduction in labor by 96% to 97.5% and a reduction in tin consumption by 40% by using only cold rolling and electroplating methods.

In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to widely use electricity and chemistry in the production process, and to vigorously study the further use of radioactive radiation in industry, especially for inspecting the quality of materials and controlling the production process.

Advanced production processes will be able to greatly increase labor productivity, reduce costs, and improve the quality of products. It is necessary to more decisively and quickly use advanced processes in production.

The mechanization of heavy and labor-intensive work is an important direction of technological progress. The Party and the government have raised the issue of the necessity of vigorously developing mechanization. We have done a lot of work in this regard. However, our level of mechanization of production is still not high enough, and the proportion of manual labor is still large.

Let's talk about the coal industry. In the post-war years, the coal industry indeed received a large amount of new technical equipment, but there are still many shortcomings in the use of this technical equipment. The most serious shortcoming is the insufficient promotion of full mechanization, so in the production process, individual heavy operations are still not mechanized. In the coal industry, despite the large number of excavators, combined machines, and other machines, labor productivity is still low, and the cost of coal is still high, one of the reasons for this is here.

In many other industrial sectors, as well as in transportation and construction, the situation is not better.

It should be noted that the main reason for the slow progress of full mechanization is that many of our production sectors have not yet obtained the necessary set of machines, including both main and auxiliary production processes. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, machine builders must seriously address this important task.

The draft directive emphasizes the need to greatly accelerate the mechanization of various types of work, to carry out full mechanization of main and auxiliary operations in all industrial sectors, and to pay special attention to the full mechanization of loading and unloading work, which currently has too many workers engaged in this work.

The next stage of technological development, higher than mechanization, is the automation of production.

The essence of automation is that the production process is realized with the least physical labor of workers, freeing workers from heavy operations, and their main responsibility is to manage the production process. Due to automation, one or a few workers can manage a large number of machines and mechanisms. In the case of automation, the nature of workers' labor will change, and workers' labor will increasingly approach the labor of technicians and engineers.

The widespread use of production automation will open up prospects for unprecedented growth in labor productivity, and under socialist conditions, it promotes the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the working people. In addition, automation can ensure the improvement of product quality and the reduction of product costs, and can strengthen the safety and continuity of the production process.

Only through automation can the management of atomic equipment and the production processes that many people cannot directly manage in the chemical industry and other industrial sectors be realized.

What effects automation can produce can be seen from the example of the Dnieper hydroelectric station. There, 9 water turbines with a total capacity of 650,000 kW and some other machines of the hydroelectric station are managed by only 6 workers per shift.

At the Ordzhonikidze cascade of the Uzbek power system, only two or three workers manage 4 hydroelectric stations from one place.

The automation of machine-building factories can achieve very high economic results. Our modernized automatic assembly lines enable us to reduce the number of workers to one-fifth to one-tenth of the previous number. And the working time for processing products is also reduced by this much. Automation should be implemented in all industrial sectors. This is a task shared by heavy industry, light industry, and the food industry.

Automatic computers should play a particularly important role in the automation industry, as these machines can independently determine the most favorable conditions in the production process and maintain these conditions, and can also determine and control tasks related to product quality.

Thus, the development of automation has great significance for the state. However, the various departments and authorities have not given this important matter the necessary attention.

The task proposed in the draft directive is to carry out large-scale automation of the production process in industry, to more quickly transition from the automation of individual machines and operations to the automation of workshop production processes, to transition to the establishment of completely automated enterprises, thereby greatly increasing labor productivity.

The various departments and the State Technical Committee must take more decisive measures to implement automation in all sectors of the national economy.

While replacing equipment, improving production processes, and implementing mechanization and automation, there is also the task of improving the quality of new machines, equipment, instruments, and other products, striving to keep up with the latest achievements of science and technology, and timely replacing old machines, equipment, and instruments from production with new ones. It should be said that among some of our economists, an anti-scientific theory is prevalent, which claims that there is no phenomenon of "depreciation" of machines in socialism. This harmful theory has even infiltrated the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia," and its proponents insist that the phenomenon of "depreciation" of machines is only inherent in the capitalist economy, while in the socialist economy, "technological progress will not produce 'depreciation,' and the depreciation of fixed assets does not include 'depreciation.'" (Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Vol. 2, p. 291)

It is not difficult to see that this "theory" has become a shield for conservatism and inertia. Its purpose is to try to prove that, as if the use of obsolete equipment that does not meet the highest technical level achieved by our advanced enterprises is beneficial to socialist society. But who does not know that lagging behind in the adoption of new technology means wasting social labor, hindering the improvement of labor productivity.

Technological progress can save social labor, producing more products with less labor.

However, some of our poor economists do not study the issue of the economic effects of adopting new technologies that ensure the victory of socialism in the competition with capitalism but believe that the use of obsolete machines is a law of socialist economic development.

It is not superfluous to remind these "economists" of Lenin's wise words, Lenin said: "...economists must always look forward, towards technological progress, otherwise they will immediately fall behind, because whoever does not want to look forward is turning his back on history: there is no middle way, and there cannot be." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 5, p. 125)

Science plays a particularly important role in technological progress.

The necessity of accelerating technological progress requires the most extensive development of theoretical research, new great scientific discoveries, and the integration of advanced production experience. In this regard, we have achieved a lot. Despite this, there are still many new and extremely important tasks facing science.

When we appropriately evaluate the invaluable contribution of our scientists to the common cause of developing the country's economy and culture, it is still necessary to point out the shortcomings in the organization and arrangement of scientific work.

For example, some scientific research institutions and individual scientific workers have been working for many years without results, which is unacceptable. Many scientific research institutes and scientific workers have insufficient contact with production. Some scientific institutions have a serious sense of complacency and self-satisfaction.

In these scientific institutions, it is necessary to bring in some fresh air through criticism and self-criticism and to carry out creative discussions on scientific issues. Only in this way can the shortcomings hindering the development of science be overcome, especially the erroneous tendency of some scientists to monopolize the leadership of individual scientific fields.

To ensure the acceleration of technological progress, it is necessary to increase the number of scientific workers in the machine-building, instrument-making, and power industries. It is necessary to improve the quality of the work of training scientific personnel. Now it is time to greatly improve the work of training scientific cadres through the system of research fellows, to raise the requirements for granting degrees and academic titles. In short, it is time to rectify this important work.

Many scientific institutions have correctly and reasonably proposed to expand the powers of the leaders of scientific research institutions. Due to the incorrectness of this aspect, the leaders of scientific research institutions now cannot even solve basic issues such as the reasonable use of scientific cadres and the allocation of funds for scientific research work.

At the July Plenary Session of the Central Committee, we solved the issue of expanding the powers of enterprise leaders. The Council of Ministers should also pass a similar resolution regarding the leaders of scientific research institutions.

To attract talented personnel to participate in scientific work and to remove those who have not made useful and practical research results in scientific research institutions for many years, it is necessary to conduct regular appraisals in various scientific research institutes to allocate the positions of scientific workers.

To raise science to a higher level and expand the scale of scientific research work, it is necessary to attract new forces to participate in scientific work and to achieve new scientific achievements on a broader front. How to do this?

If only the existing scientific research institutions are expanded and new ones are established, it will take a long time, and we cannot wait for this. Therefore, it is necessary to widely attract colleges and universities and the design and experimental departments of various industrial departments to engage in scientific research work. It is necessary to truly consolidate and widely utilize the laboratories of colleges and universities and the experimental departments of industrial departments to engage in scientific research work. By adopting this method, it is possible to expand the front of domestic scientific research in a short period of time and to greatly improve the proficiency of scientific personnel.

The constant and extensive exchange of work situations among various scientific departments and among relevant scientific departments is of great significance for scientific work. Without extensive exchange of opinions, science cannot develop. However, in many cases, this exchange is difficult due to excessive secrecy of materials. An unreasonable secrecy system causes duplication in scientific work and sometimes allows negligent workers to escape scientific criticism. Of course, I do not advocate making truly secret things public. It is necessary to reasonably organize the exchange of experience, opinions, and scientific information among our various scientific institutions, to strengthen the mutual connection among various scientific research institutions, and to strengthen their connection with foreign scientific institutions and progressive scientists. It is necessary to purchase more foreign technical books and publish them in the USSR, to improve the technical bulletin work of various departments, scientific research institutes, and enterprises, and to rectify the work of exchanging advanced experience.

The existing system of scientific institutions in our country, which has approximately 3,000 scientific academies, departmental research institutes, scientific research laboratories, and other scientific research institutions, has never been carefully studied as a whole, and it is obviously not the most reasonable, economical, and efficient system. In the summary report of the Central Committee, it is correctly pointed out that our scientific research institutes and higher educational institutions are unreasonably over-concentrated in the central part of the country, especially in Moscow. I can cite some prominent materials as an example.

In Moscow, Leningrad, and within the Moscow and Leningrad regions, the scientific research institutes of various departments and authorities account for more than one-third of their total number, and the scientific institutions of the Soviet Academy of Sciences account for two-thirds. In these institutions, 60% of the scientific workers of various departments and authorities and 85% of the scientific workers of the Soviet Academy of Sciences are concentrated.

The scientific research institutes of the Soviet Non-Ferrous Metallurgy Department are two-thirds located in Moscow and Leningrad, and the situation in the chemical, wood, paper, and wood processing industrial departments is roughly the same.

For example, all the refractory material research institutes of the Soviet Iron and Steel Industry Department are located in Leningrad. All the hunting research institutes of the Soviet Consumer Cooperative Union, all the horse breeding research institutes of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, and the All-Union Fur and Antler Animal Scientific Research Institute of the Soviet State Farm Department are all located in Moscow and its vicinity, and there are also other similar institutions in Moscow and Leningrad that have production bases. The situation of many colleges and universities is also like this.

Title: The Sixth Five-Year Plan for the National Economy of the USSR
Author:
Date: 1956-02-25
Page: 1

The various departments, the State Planning Commission, the State Technical Commission, and the Academy of Sciences of the USSR should study and resolve the issues related to improving the organization of scientific research work in the system of the Academy of Sciences, higher educational institutions, and scientific research institutes of various industrial departments. They should particularly provide their opinions on the more rational distribution of scientific research institutes and higher educational institutions, bringing them closer to the production bases.

In our country, there are the most favorable conditions for the further development of science. We have a large number of highly skilled scientific workers who are eager to truly help in the development of the national economy and actively participate in the construction of a communist society. The only thing needed is to properly and correctly organize this huge force and to provide constant assistance to our scientific personnel.

The directives in the draft plan for the extensive implementation of the plan for the advancement of industrial technology will largely depend on the degree of specialization and cooperation in industry.

Only under the conditions of continuous flow production can we most effectively utilize modern high-efficiency technology. Specialization and cooperation can achieve this goal.

During the previous five-year plans, our industry has made some progress in specialization. However, there are many shortcomings in this area. The Central Committee plenary session in July last year gave a detailed criticism of these shortcomings and proposed major measures to expand specialization and cooperation in industry.

After the plenary session, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR took a number of practical measures to better coordinate the specialization of the departments and to concentrate the production of the same type of goods in their enterprises. This applies to the production of diesel engines, instruments, and certain other products. However, this is not enough.

Some department heads and many factory directors are afraid of specialization and large-scale cooperation because this would require changing the established forms of production organization.

There are also some leaders who want to postpone the work of specialization until later and apply specialization to the newly built specialized factories, while the existing factories continue to produce as before.

We cannot allow this situation to continue. We must actively implement the policy of large-scale specialization and cooperation in industry, rationally organize the production links between enterprises, and strictly adhere to the state discipline in the execution of cooperation delivery plans.

The draft directive provides for extensive measures for the implementation of production specialization. The machine-building industry is the first to be reorganized. Up to now, the production of the same type of machines has been managed by different departments and supervisory bodies.

Many departments and supervisory bodies have factories producing very important goods that do not belong to their production scope. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture produces about 10% of all metal-cutting machine tools in the country and 24% of forging and pressing machines. The machines produced by the factories of this ministry are often technically backward and have high production costs because they are produced in small batches, and the technological processes are imperfect.

A large number of castings, forgings, metal parts, tools, and other mass-produced products are produced by many factories themselves, which is very expensive and cannot guarantee the quality of the products. This is because there are no specialized foundries and forging machine plants, and the development of the metalworking and tool-making industry is insufficient. The specialized production of electrodes and dies is the same.

Some industrial managers believe that the sole purpose of specialization is to reduce the variety of products, which is incorrect. With the progress of technology, the number of varieties and types of products increases faster than the number of new factories.

The current task is to make each factory produce products that are of the same type according to the technological process, strive for the standardization of parts and components, and organize their mass production in specialized factories.

We can find words about the progressive role of specialized production in the works of Lenin. He wrote: "To raise the productivity of human labor in the production of a certain part of the whole product, it is necessary to specialize this part of the production, to make it a special production of a large number of products, which can (and must) use machines, etc." (Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 1, p. 84).

The draft directive provides for the establishment of specialized factories and workshops in various economic regions of the country to produce castings, forgings, dies, standard tools, spare parts, wooden and plastic products, solid tools, and other items. It is also planned to establish specialized factories to produce automatic production lines and mechanized equipment.

The various industrial departments must rationally allocate which department should manage the factories producing the same type of products, and this first applies to the factories producing metal-cutting machine tools, forging equipment, and turbines.

The Central Committee believes that to promote the specialization and cooperation of industry in various economic regions and major industrial centers, a long-term plan must be drawn up. The party committees, governments, and economic organizations of the union republics, territories, and regions must actively participate in the formulation of this plan.

The task of further developing the plan for the development of industry requires a lot of work in uncovering and fully utilizing the potential of all industrial enterprises. In some industrial departments, production capacity has not been fully utilized. Many factories are very slow to put their full capacity into production, their equipment utilization rate is low, and they often leave equipment idle.

The various industrial departments and factory directors have not taken the necessary measures to ensure harmonious production, reduce the loss of working time, or effectively utilize their auxiliary labor force. These shortcomings must be resolutely eliminated.

By adding the latest machinery, eliminating "weak links," improving production organization, and widely promoting the methods of advanced factories and production innovators, we can create new opportunities to increase production in existing factories in the current five-year plan.

The State Planning Commission estimates that through the improvement of production organization and more effective utilization of production equipment, it is possible to produce at least an additional 700 million tons of pig iron, 1,100 million tons of steel, 7,000 million tons of coal, approximately 100,000 tractors, 1,000 million tons of cement, 4,200 million pairs of shoes, and a large number of other items important to the national economy.

To obtain such an additional quantity of products in new factories, we should build 10 or more blast furnaces and 35 open-hearth furnaces, dig two hundred coal mines, build two tractor factories, 17 cement factories, and 8 shoe factories. Such construction work will require tens of billions of rubles.

Comrades! The constant progress of technology is closely related to our working people because it is a reliable way to lighten labor and increase labor productivity for the benefit of the whole society.

Technological progress is not just the work of scientists, engineers, technicians, and research institutes and design bureaus. No, this is the task of all of us—party, government, and economic organizations, scientists, engineers, innovators, and inventors. We must all work together to improve technology.

The Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the USSR believe that we must mobilize all our forces to complete the important task of promoting technological progress.

The socialist economic system and modern scientific achievements provide us with limitless potential for the development of technology. Under the leadership of our great party, the entire Soviet people must fully utilize these potentials and strive to take the lead in technological progress. We can do this and must do this.

Agricultural Tasks

One of the main goals of the sixth five-year plan is to ensure a significant increase in agricultural production.

Comrade Khrushchev, in his report to the Central Committee, thoroughly analyzed the agricultural situation and outlined in detail the tasks set by our party in this area.

The report extensively describes the measures taken by the Central Committee to overcome the mistakes and shortcomings in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, and to create the necessary conditions for a great leap forward in our socialist agriculture. The plan drawn up by the party to significantly increase agricultural production will be steadfastly implemented.

During the sixth five-year plan, agricultural production will increase by approximately 70%, which is much faster than during the fifth five-year plan. The indicators for the more important agricultural departments are as follows:

The total grain production in 1960 should be increased to 11 billion poods.

The plan is to expand the corn planting area to at least 28 million hectares by 1960 and to organize the mass production of corn hybrid seeds, as these seeds can significantly increase the yield per unit area.

The harvest of 11 billion poods of grain will enable us to meet the growing demand for food, increase government reserves, establish the necessary reserves for collective farms, expand exports to friendly countries, and reserve sufficient grain for livestock feeding.

For industrial raw materials—cotton, flax, and sugar beets—large targets are set. The production of flax will increase by more than one-third, and the production of cotton will increase by more than one-half.

Special attention must be paid to the expansion of sugar beet production. The yield per unit area must be increased, and the planting area of sugar beets must be expanded in the main sugar beet-producing regions and in other regions where conditions are favorable for the cultivation of this crop.

The Party Central Committee and the government recently adopted an important resolution to promote the increase in the production of potatoes and vegetables. According to this resolution, the procurement price of potatoes will be increased on average to nearly three times, and the purchase price will be increased by 70%. The procurement and purchase prices of vegetables will be increased on average by 70%. Other measures are also stipulated, which will benefit collective farms and state farms in expanding the production of potatoes and vegetables.

To improve the supply of potatoes, vegetables, and full-fat milk to urban residents, it is planned to expand the existing dairy farms and vegetable-potato areas near large cities and industrial centers and to build new dairy farms and vegetable-potato areas.

In the livestock industry, it is planned to sharply increase production to fully meet the needs of the population for meat, milk, and other livestock products.

The production of meat will be doubled, mainly through the expansion of pig farming. Collective farms and state farms must organize the mass breeding and fattening of pigs. In addition, it is necessary to make full use of the existing possibilities to increase the production of beef and mutton.

The production of milk will be increased by nearly one hundred percent, mainly by significantly increasing the milk yield per cow and increasing the breeding rate of cows.

In the past two years, collective farms in Voronezh, Ternopol, Chelyabinsk, Kursk, and other regions have increased the milk yield per cow by 600 to 900 kilograms, which shows that if collective farms are determined to increase production, they have such a great potential to quickly increase milk production.

The initiative of the collective farmers and other agricultural workers in Voronezh is being enthusiastically supported by all regions. Comrades Kirichenko, Patolichev, Brezhnev, Kapitonov, Suslov, Ignatyev, and other representatives here have assured the representative congress that Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Bashkir Autonomous Republic, Krasnodar Territory, and Moscow and other regions will be able to complete the agricultural production targets of the sixth five-year plan earlier than the time specified in the draft directive.

The people of our country will welcome with great satisfaction the assurances made from the high platform of the 20th Party Congress. We hope that all republics, territories, and regions will achieve success in fulfilling their assurances.

There is no doubt that under the guidance and active assistance of the party and government agencies, our peasants, who are engaged in socialist competition, will successfully complete and exceed the targets of the sixth five-year plan.

Transport and Communications Tasks

Due to the significant expansion of the national economy during the sixth five-year plan, the volume of cargo transportation will increase significantly.

The main task of cargo transportation, as before, will be carried out by railways. The increase in railway cargo alone will exceed 40 billion ton-kilometers, approximately equal to the total cargo volume of the railways of the USSR in 1940.

To adapt to such a large volume of cargo, the carrying capacity of the railways must be significantly increased. Therefore, the basic task in railway transportation is to further improve its technical equipment.

The main trend in the technical progress of railway transportation is the transition to electric and diesel traction, the widespread use of automated and centralized management of transportation, and the improvement of track equipment.

According to a 15-year general plan for the electrification of railways adopted by the Central Committee of the Party, it is planned to convert important cargo lines, mountainous lines, busy passenger lines, and suburban lines of large industrial centers to electric traction.

The first stage of this railway technical reconstruction plan will be completed during the sixth five-year plan.

The plan calls for the electrification of 8,100 kilometers of railway lines, which is 3.6 times the length of the electrification during the fifth five-year plan. The electrification of an important railway trunk line of national significance, the Moscow-Kuybyshev-Chelyabinsk-Omsk-Novosibirsk-Irkutsk line, will be completed. The Moscow-Kharkov-Donbas line and other railway lines will also be converted to electric traction. The use of diesel locomotives will be significantly expanded. In five years, the length of railway lines using diesel locomotives will increase from 7,000 kilometers to 25,000 kilometers.

The technical reconstruction of traction should make it possible to transport 40% to 45% of the total cargo volume by electric and diesel locomotives in 1960, while this figure was 14% in 1955.

An important task for the railways is to improve their track equipment. The draft directive provides for the laying of 65,000 kilometers of new rails on the existing railway network, including 58,000 kilometers of heavy rails, and the widespread use of reinforced concrete sleepers. This means that nearly half of the main lines will be laid with heavier new rails, which will significantly increase their carrying capacity, reduce labor consumption in track maintenance and repair, and significantly reduce operating costs.

It is planned to supply the railways with at least 2,000 electric locomotives, 2,250 diesel locomotives, 255,000 freight cars, and 18,600 passenger cars in five years.

The draft directive provides for the further expansion of the railway network. It is planned to lay and put into operation approximately 6,500 kilometers of new lines, which is twice as much as the railway lines laid during the fifth five-year plan. The following important railway lines will be put into operation: the Magnitogorsk-Sterlitamak-Abdulino line (this line is a direct route from South Siberia to the European part of the state, bypassing the busy Chelyabinsk-Ufa line); the Stalingrad-Abagan line (this is an important part of the South Siberian trunk line, aimed at transporting ore to the Kuznetsk metallurgical plant and exporting coal from the Tomusinsk mine area); the Barnaul-Omsk line (this is a new route from Kuzbass to the Urals, bypassing the busy Novosibirsk-Omsk line); the Guriev-Astrakhan line (this is a railway line connecting the Orenburg line and the Ordzhonikidze line, which shortens the cargo route from the Urals to the Caucasus by 500 kilometers).

It is also planned to build a railway line from Alma-Ata to the border of the USSR to provide a new connection with the western regions of China via the shortest route, which will be the third railway line connecting our country with the People's Republic of China.

In addition to laying new railways, approximately 6,600 kilometers of double-track lines will be laid, which is 40% more than during the fifth five-year plan period.

Maritime Transport. During the five-year period, the volume of maritime cargo transportation will increase by more than one hundred percent. As a result of the development of trade with the People's Republic of China, the People's Democratic Countries, the Republic of India, the Union of Burma, and other countries, the volume of exports and imports carried by Soviet ships will increase. The volume of cargo transportation between our Black Sea region, Far East region, and other regions and via the Northern Sea Route will significantly increase.

Our scientists' achievements in the field of atomic energy have provided our sailors and polar explorers with new weapons to conquer the harsh Arctic. During the sixth five-year plan period, we will build a powerful atomic icebreaker, which will extend the Arctic navigation season and allow our ships to overcome thick ice barriers.

Our merchant fleet will receive a large number of new and most modern ships. During the five-year period, it will receive cargo ships with a total tonnage of 160 million tons, which is 80% more than during the fifth five-year plan period. We will build new large tankers, timber carriers, diesel ships, and other vessels. Therefore, we must pay more attention to the development of our shipbuilding industry.

The draft directive provides for the improvement of the technical equipment of seaports and the increase of their throughput capacity.

River Transport. It is planned to increase the volume of river cargo transportation by 80% during these five years. Our river transport workers must significantly increase the transportation of grain, timber, oil, coal, and other bulk cargoes. Their important task is to ensure navigation on the new deep-water routes on the Volga, Kama, Dnieper, and their tributaries, which have appeared due to the construction of hydroelectric power stations.

During the sixth five-year plan period, the River Transport Department must bring its port and wharf facilities to an appropriate level and ensure the development of ports and wharfs, primarily on the Volga, Kama, and Siberian rivers.

The River Transport Department will receive motor cargo ships, tugboats, and passenger ships with a total capacity of 900,000 horsepower and non-motorized ships with a total deadweight of more than 200 million tons. Given that our country has 500,000 kilometers of waterways suitable for navigation and timber floating, river transport must be significantly expanded and must become the cheapest mode of transport.

Road transport will continue to develop. During the five-year plan period, the volume of road cargo transportation will increase by approximately 100%, and the volume of passenger transportation will increase by more than 200%.

In 1960, the automobile industry will produce 650,000 trucks, passenger cars, and buses, and the production of trailers will increase several times. It is planned to replace old cars, buses, and engines with more powerful cars, buses, and engines.

The sixth five-year plan plans to expand the construction and reconstruction of hard-surfaced roads. We must build more roads that are more durable and long-lasting than asphalt concrete roads.

The goal of air transport is to increase the volume of cargo transportation by 100%, increase the volume of passenger transportation by approximately 280%, and provide the airlines with larger and faster modern airliners.

Communications. The draft directive provides for the significant expansion and reconstruction of communication facilities based on the latest technological achievements. For example, we plan to build at least 10,000 kilometers of radio relay communication lines in five years, which will allow simultaneous telephone conversations in one direction up to 1,200 times and long-distance television broadcasting.

During the sixth five-year plan period, the number of calls on automatic telephone exchanges will increase to approximately twice that of the previous five-year plan. It is also planned to increase the number of post offices and expand telephone and radio facilities in rural areas.

Basic Construction Tasks

The following materials on the basic investments of our previous five-year plans (calculated as of July 1, 1955) will enable you to judge the scale of basic construction in the sixth five-year plan.

The basic investments of the state during the first five-year plan period amounted to 58 billion rubles, the figure for the second five-year plan was 1,325 billion rubles, the figure for the three and a half years of the third five-year plan was 1,310 billion rubles, the figure for the fourth five-year plan was 3,110 billion rubles, and the figure for the fifth five-year plan was 5,940 billion rubles.

Now the sixth five-year plan provides for 9,900 billion rubles in investments.

From these figures, it can be seen that the amount of basic investments in this five-year plan exceeds the total basic investments of the fourth and fifth five-year plans.

Of the 9,900 billion rubles allocated for the entire national economy, more than 6,000 billion rubles will be used for industry; this figure is 70% higher than the fifth five-year plan period.

The bulk of this basic investment will be used to build new enterprises for the production of electricity, chemical products, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, oil and coal, building materials, and timber. Investments in these industries will exceed 4,000 billion rubles.

Light industry and food industry will receive 75% more investments than in the previous five-year plan, and transportation and communications will receive 70% more investments.

Investments in agriculture will increase by 1,200 billion rubles, which is nearly double the figure for the fifth five-year plan. In addition, collective farms will invest approximately 1,000 billion rubles from their own funds.

Funds for the construction of housing, public utilities, schools, hospitals, children's welfare institutions, cinemas, and theaters will be significantly increased. In this regard, a total of 2,000 billion rubles will be allocated, while in the fifth five-year plan period it was 1,200 billion rubles.

Funds for the procurement of new, more efficient equipment will be increased. Although the total basic investments are increased by 67%, the funds for new machines and equipment will be increased by 80%.

In recent years, the construction industry has established a solid technical base and has been equipped with advanced machines and equipment. This industry now has more skilled workers, engineers, and technicians. Currently, more than 80% of all construction work is carried out by specialized construction organizations.

The sixth five-year plan provides for a large-scale industrial construction plan. For example, more generating capacity will be put into production than in all previous five-year plans combined. In the coal industry, it is planned to build new mines and open-pit mines with a total production capacity of 24,000 million tons, which is much more than the combined figures for the fourth and fifth five-year plans.

Significant goals are set for the use of new production equipment. In this regard, it should be noted that many departments and construction organizations did not fulfill the time schedule for putting new production capacities into operation during the fifth five-year plan. This situation must be stopped, and during the current five-year period, it must become the law of every department, every central administration, and every enterprise to strictly adhere to the time schedule for putting new equipment into operation. To do this, it is necessary to use a much larger amount of material and financial resources for basic construction more effectively.

During the previous five-year period, the construction industry did not fulfill its task of reducing costs. Many construction organizations have been working at a loss year after year and have incurred non-production expenses.

Our goal during the sixth five-year plan period is to reduce the cost of construction and installation work by at least 7% through improved organization, increased labor productivity, and reduced overhead, thereby saving approximately 300 billion rubles.

Some of our construction experts recently visited the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Sweden, and other countries, where they saw many interesting things.

Our construction workers should make use of the best experiences of the construction organizations of other countries.

The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR attach great importance to the construction industry and have adopted a series of resolutions, proposing a comprehensive plan to improve construction work.

They have also taken major organizational measures. Five new construction industry departments have been established: the Power Station Construction Department, the Oil Industry Construction Department, the Coal Industry Enterprise Construction Department, the Transportation Construction Department, and the Urban and Rural Construction Department. The Construction Department and the Metallurgical and Chemical Industry Enterprise Construction Department have been reorganized into Union and Republic Departments.

The construction industry organizations of Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev have been merged into larger regional units: the Moscow Construction Administration, the Leningrad Construction Administration, and the Kiev Construction Administration. As a result of this merger, the number of managerial personnel and employees has been significantly reduced, and industrial construction methods have been more widely used. Before the merger, the construction industry organizations of Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev often failed to complete their annual plans; now their plans are completed well. They have exceeded the task of increasing labor productivity last year and have reduced construction costs by 70 million rubles compared to the budget.

Similar mergers in Rostov-on-Don on the Don River, Komsomolsk-on-Amur on the Amur River, and other cities have also yielded good results.

Despite the obvious advantages of expanding construction industry organizations, the merger work has been progressing very slowly. Currently, there are still a large number of small construction industry organizations that duplicate each other, belong to different departments and supervisory bodies, and whose work is not profitable. For example, in Sverdlovsk, there are 74 construction industry organizations, and in Novosibirsk, there are 84.

Since it is obviously appropriate to expand construction organizations, why is the merger progressing so slowly?

The serious obstacle is that many departments and supervisory bodies have taken a wrong, purely narrow-minded attitude towards the entire issue, treating it with a narrow-minded attitude of a private entrepreneur. It should be said that the State Construction Committee has not shown the necessary persistence in the issue of merging construction organizations into larger units.

We must resolutely combat these backward tendencies and those bureaucrats who hinder such an important state affair.

The main tasks in basic construction are to significantly shorten construction time, prevent the dispersion of funds on many projects, oppose extravagance in design and construction, continue to industrialize construction work through the widespread use of prefabricated reinforced concrete components produced in factories and construction material yards, and strive for full mechanization of construction.

It is necessary to increase the technical equipment of construction organizations, especially in the eastern regions; to organize enterprises for the production of building materials and components in the regions; to more resolutely carry out the work of further merging construction organizations, improving the quality of leadership of construction work, and strengthening state discipline.

Construction workers must improve the quality of construction work, especially in housing, municipal, and cultural construction projects; reduce construction costs and make construction organizations profitable; fully utilize all existing machinery, improve the supply of materials and technical equipment to construction sites. The role and responsibility of design, research, and construction organizations in the application of scientific and technological achievements must be increased.

I have explained the main tasks of the sixth five-year plan regarding industry, agriculture, transportation, communications, and basic construction.

Their scale is unprecedented, and their implementation will significantly advance the entire national economy of our country, increase our material, food, and financial resources, and further strengthen the economic power of our great motherland.

Increasing Labor Productivity and Improving Management

The party's policy of accelerating technological progress will be reflected in a significant increase in labor productivity, because only on this basis can the continuous and rapid expansion of socialist production be guaranteed.

Our people have a direct interest in the growth of labor productivity. The increase in labor productivity is the solid foundation for increasing the real wages of workers, increasing the income of collective farmers, and improving the living standards of all the people.

Since the end of the war, industrial labor productivity has almost increased to 2.3 times, and in construction and railways, it has increased to two times. However, in the fifth five-year plan, the targets for labor productivity set by the 19th Party Congress were not fully achieved.

In industry, labor productivity increased by 44%, while the target was 50%; in construction, the figures were 45% and 55%, respectively. Agriculture also did not achieve the labor productivity targets.

During the sixth five-year plan period, we must complete the task of more rapidly increasing labor productivity.

The draft directive provides for an increase in industrial productivity of at least 50%, in construction of at least 52%, and a significant increase in productivity in agriculture and transportation.

According to the sixth five-year plan, the main means of increasing labor productivity will be the widespread use of modern new machines in industry, agriculture, transportation, construction, and other economic sectors. I only need to say that the electrical equipment of industrial workers will increase by more than 60% in five years.

The revision of production quotas and wage rates will greatly help to increase labor productivity.

Is it normal to have such a situation: even in the presence of significant shortcomings in labor organization and considerable waste of working time, many of our machine-building factories still have workers completing production quotas by 180%, 200%, or even more, while the labor productivity targets are often not met. Take the Kharkov Machine Tool Plant as an example: in 1955, the average completion of production quotas was 190%, while the labor productivity plan was only 86% completed.

It goes without saying that such over-completion of quotas is unrelated to the achievements of innovators and advanced production workers, and for innovators and advanced production workers, in the event of a significant over-completion of quotas, labor productivity must also increase accordingly.

The use of such low production quotas and their significant over-completion creates an illusion that everything is fine and makes workers, foremen, and engineers not pay attention to the real improvement of productivity. Currently, production quotas are actually not determined by the achieved technical level and labor organization level, but by the desire to make quotas fit the established wage level.

It is not normal to have such a situation: the basic wage accounts for no more than 40% to 60% of a worker's total income, and in many factories, this is even lower. It is necessary to promptly revise the wage system in industry and pave the way for the widespread implementation of production quotas determined by technology.

At the same time, we should eliminate the situation where workers' wages differ greatly in the same industry and often in the same region.

The wage system must provide material incentives for increasing productivity and improving technology. The provisions of this system must ensure that each worker receives wages according to the quality and quantity of his labor.

It is also necessary to significantly improve the existing wage and bonus system for engineers, technicians, and economic managers. As N. S. Khrushchev pointed out in his report to the Central Committee, we must ensure that part of the remuneration of these personnel is strictly dependent on the basic production indicators of the respective shops, factories, or industries.

Therefore, comrades, we are facing a very important and urgent task: to revise the labor quotas and wage system for workers, employees, and engineering and technical personnel.

The heads of various departments and supervisory bodies and the State Committee for Labor and Wages should be more active in implementing the resolutions of the Central Committee's July plenary session on these issues.

One of the most important conditions for the implementation of our plan for the development of the national economy is the completion of the task of reducing the cost of products and circulation expenses.

The draft directive provides for a reduction of at least 17% in the cost of industrial production, railway operating expenses, and circulation expenses of state and cooperative trade. Including all sectors of the national economy, the total amount of money saved in five years should be approximately 5,000 billion rubles, which is more than half of the total basic investments for the sixth five-year plan. Therefore, the completion of the task of reducing the cost of products and circulation expenses is a very important task for the national economy.

To fully utilize the existing possibilities for reducing the cost of products and turn them into effective accumulation sources, the party and economic organizations must pay special attention to improving every aspect of enterprise management, strictly adhering to economy in every enterprise, more effective economic accounting, special attention to eliminating all bureaucratic phenomena, incompetent management, and waste of labor and material resources, special attention to ensuring better utilization of equipment, raw materials, materials, fuel, and electricity, and special attention to promoting the broader use of substitutes for metals, leather, natural fibers, and food industry raw materials.

The main requirement of our party for all enterprise leaders is that they always act in the interests of socialist society, strive tirelessly to fulfill state plans, and contribute to the improvement of production and the prosperity of our people with all their activities.

Improving Material and Cultural Standards

Comrades, constant concern for the well-being of the people is the highest principle of our party's activities. The great plans for the development of the economy and culture being implemented in our country aim to continuously improve the well-being of the Soviet people, further increase the cultural level of all Soviet people, and more fully satisfy their material and spiritual needs.

During the sixth five-year plan period, this noble goal is also before us. Further significantly improving the material well-being of the Soviet people, expanding housing construction, and improving cultural, educational, and health standards are one of the main goals of the new five-year plan.

We know that the most general indicator of the development of a country's economy and the growth of its social wealth is its national income. Under the socialist system, the entire national income is truly the people's income. The sixth five-year plan provides for an increase in the national income of the USSR by approximately 60%.

Based on the increase in national income, the personal income of residents will also increase. During the sixth five-year period, the real wages of workers will increase by approximately 30%. The cash and in-kind income of collective farmers will increase by no less than 40%, mainly from the increase in the distribution of collective farm income per workday.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have made immeasurable efforts in recent years to significantly strengthen the economic power of the state and increase the social wealth of the country. As you all know, this has enabled the Central Committee of the Party to propose extremely important measures to further improve the living standards of the people and improve their working conditions to this representative congress. These measures are:

Increasing the wages of low-paid workers and conducting a general adjustment of workers' wages.

Transitioning to a 7-hour workday starting from 1957, or in some departments transitioning to an 8-hour workday but working 5 days a week and resting 2 days.

Starting from 1956, reducing the working hours on Saturdays and the day before holidays by 2 hours; restoring the 6-hour workday for youth aged 16 to 18.

Completely improving the pension system, significantly increasing the amount of low pensions, and providing more care for the disabled and the elderly.

Improving the working and living conditions of women; in particular, extending the paid maternity leave.

Starting from the new school year, all higher education, secondary specialized education, and senior classes of ten-year schools will be tuition-free.

All these proposals of the Central Committee have been enthusiastically supported by our people, and there is no doubt that the 20th Congress will unanimously adopt these proposals as part of the directive on the sixth five-year plan, as a new vivid proof of the party and government's unwavering concern for improving the living standards of the Soviet people.

The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government are confident that our people will respond with greater labor enthusiasm to this concern, and they will do their utmost to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the sixth five-year plan.

Comrades, with the increase in the income of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, it is necessary to expand trade and increase the quantity of goods sold by state and cooperative trade organizations.

During the five-year period, the total retail trade volume should increase by 50%. However, the task is not only to expand trade but also to improve the quality of trade.

Therefore, the draft directive provides for an increase in the sales volume of goods such as butter, meat, milk, cheese, and sugar, as well as woolen fabrics, linen fabrics, shoes, and furniture at a higher rate. The sales volume of cultural and household necessities such as radio receivers, televisions, household refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and cars will also increase. Trade organizations must better study the needs of consumers, ensure correct distribution, and ensure the timely delivery of goods to stores. Our trade organizations must work in such a way that the necessary goods can be bought everywhere in the country.

The sixth five-year plan provides for the rapid development of public catering, increasing the number of canteens and restaurants. Our goal is not only to provide meals for workers but also for their families, thus reducing the labor of housewives. School canteens and food kiosks will be set up.

The sixth five-year plan sets a huge task in housing construction.

We know that both before and after the war, the scale of state housing construction has always been large. However, as I pointed out earlier, the demand for housing is still very urgent, and improving the living conditions of the people is a special concern of the party and the government.

During the sixth five-year plan period, 205 million square meters of new housing will be built with government funds alone. This is nearly double the figure for the previous five-year plan.

The state will encourage and assist in every way the working people to build houses with their savings and with the help of government loans. We should expand housing construction in rural areas. Collective farms should more actively help their members build houses with their savings, and if necessary, collective farms should lend money to members to build houses. We plan to significantly increase the supply of building materials to collective farms and residents, such as cement, timber, metal, glass, slate, wall materials, etc.

The large-scale housing construction plan requires a rapid increase in the production of furniture and the improvement of its quality.

Currently, the supply of furniture is insufficient, and the furniture industry cannot satisfactorily meet the growing demand. Therefore, it is necessary to organize the mass production of inexpensive, practical, and beautiful furniture according to the preferences of consumers without delay. The production of furniture sets should also be increased.

In addition, we must stipulate that in the future, when designing and building houses, indoor fixed furniture that is good and practical should be installed indoors. In this regard, we must learn from the good experiences of foreign countries.

One of the important tasks in our cultural development is the further development of national education.

The seven-year school system has been universally implemented. During the fifth five-year plan, we began to implement universal secondary education in cities and villages, and during the sixth five-year plan, we hope to basically complete this work.

In addition to universalizing secondary schools and secondary specialized schools, it is also necessary to further expand correspondence schools and evening schools to enable people to receive universal education and improve their cultural level without leaving production.

In the next five years, the number of graduates from the tenth grade of our secondary schools will be 6.3 million, which is more than twice the number of graduates in the past five years.

The primary task facing our national education authorities is to develop technical education in schools as much as possible. The work done in this area in the past five years is only a beginning, and it must be admitted that technical education in schools is still unsatisfactory. Many schools do not teach students labor skills and do not cultivate their respect for labor. As a result, many male and female graduates from secondary schools are not suitable for practical work.

It is necessary to greatly strengthen the material and technical base of universal education schools. During the sixth five-year plan period, we plan to build new school buildings with state funds in urban and rural areas that can accommodate nearly 4 million students, which is double the figure for the fifth five-year plan. It is necessary to more widely attract collective farms to participate in the construction and equipment of rural schools.

The universalization of secondary education is a matter of concern for the whole country. The main figures in this very important work are the school teachers. There are more than 1.7 million teachers in our universal education schools. The teaching profession in our country is one of the most respected professions because their task is to educate the builders of the future communist society. The party, government, economic organizations, and Komsomol organizations must always be concerned about schools and teachers.

The sixth five-year plan provides for the huge task of training specialists for the national economy.

Now, our country has more than 5.5 million specialists. We are proud of them because they are our extremely valuable asset, and we cherish them very much. The spokesmen of capitalism are alarmed that their countries are falling behind us in the training of specialists, and this is not without reason.

During the sixth five-year plan period, the number of specialists trained by our higher educational institutions and secondary specialized schools will increase significantly. The total number for these five years is set at 4 million, which is almost equal to the total number of the previous two five-year periods.

Industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture will receive more than 650,000 specialists with higher education, which is twice the number of the previous five years.

Currently, there is serious attention to the training of specialists in new scientific and technological fields such as automation, remote control, radio engineering, radio navigation, and the peaceful use of atomic energy.

Correspondence schools and evening schools run by higher educational institutions and secondary specialized schools will be widely developed in the new five-year plan. With the increasing number of secondary school graduates entering industry, there will be ample opportunities to enroll young people who have received good general education and have practical production experience in these schools.

The tasks of economic and cultural construction require the serious improvement of the training of specialists; they must be familiar with the latest achievements of Soviet and foreign science and technology. It is necessary to more closely combine theoretical learning with production practice, including its economic and organizational aspects.

The measures to develop the work of cinemas, newspapers, magazines, radio stations, television, and to improve libraries, clubs, and other cultural institutions provided in the draft directive are an important factor in improving the cultural level of our people.

We plan to improve and further expand the publishing industry—publish more books, magazines, and newspapers.

In the field of public health during the sixth five-year plan period, many major tasks must be solved.

The draft directive provides for the large-scale construction of medical institutions. The number of hospitals and children's welfare institutions built during the sixth five-year plan period will be approximately three times and 2.4 times the number of the previous five-year period, respectively. The number of children that kindergartens and nurseries can care for will increase by nearly 45%. This will help to further improve the working and living conditions of women and enable them to participate more actively in production and cultural, political, and other social activities.

It is necessary to improve safety measures and disease prevention measures in industry, take more effective measures to prevent water and air pollution, and improve the sanitation level of cities and villages.

Our medicine faces major tasks, and people hope for new discoveries in medicine.

Health workers, medical research institutions, and the pharmaceutical industry should strengthen their work in inventing and widely applying new therapeutic and preventive drugs and improved equipment.

The steps taken by the public health authorities to improve services to residents will always receive the support and assistance of the Central Committee of the Party and the government.

Sports are also an important factor in improving the health of the nation, and we should do everything possible to promote the development of sports, especially to improve sports among young people.

Our party will take all necessary measures to implement the extensive plan to further improve the material and cultural level of the Soviet people during the sixth five-year plan period.

Economic Development and Geographical Distribution of Productive Forces in the Republics

Comrades, the new powerful upsurge of the national economy of the state and the correct geographical distribution of productive forces are inseparable.

The directive of the 19th Party Congress stipulates the more rational geographical distribution of new industrial enterprises, aiming to bring industry closer to sources of raw materials and fuel. The need for a more rational distribution of the productive forces of the state was again emphasized by the Central Committee of the Party at its plenary session in July last year.

The victory of our industrialization policy and the development of vast raw material, fuel, and power resources in the eastern regions have made it possible to establish a new coal and metal base, large-scale machine-building, aluminum, and chemical industries, and build railway trunk lines there as early as before the war. This ensured a fundamental improvement in the distribution of productive forces. During the Great Patriotic War, our eastern industry, especially in the Urals and Siberia, was an important source of supply for the Soviet Army, and in the fourth five-year plan, it played an invaluable role in the reconstruction of regions devastated by the war.

During the previous five-year plan period, further progress was made in the rational distribution of productive forces.

According to the new plan, the party will resolutely take measures to further improve the distribution of productive forces throughout the country and comprehensively develop the economy of various economic regions.

Like our previous five-year plans, this five-year plan also stipulates the rapid development of the eastern regions, which have vast coal, iron ore, hydroelectric, timber, iron ore, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and chemical raw material resources.

It is necessary to make the vast resources of our eastern regions serve the national economy to a greater extent than before. According to the sixth five-year plan, the total basic investments in the eastern regions will increase by more than one hundred percent, accounting for approximately half of the total basic investments in the USSR.

By 1960, the eastern regions will produce more coal and pig iron than the entire USSR produced in 1950, and more electricity and cement than the entire USSR produced in 1954. During these five years, more than 100 machine-building plants will be established in the east.

It is necessary to further develop grain production in the eastern regions. By the end of the sixth five-year plan, the total grain production in the Urals, Siberia, and Kazakhstan should be double the highest production in these regions in 1954.

You have already learned from Comrade N. S. Khrushchev's report that the Central Committee of the Party and the government attach special importance to the further development of the economy of Siberia.

Outstanding figures of Russia have pointed out that Siberia has boundless resources and a brilliant future. Lomonosov said: "The strength of Russia will be increased by Siberia"; Radishchev wrote: "The wealth of Siberia is immense! It is a place of such great power! ... Once it is inhabited, it will play a great role in the history of the world."

The ideals of our great ancestors are becoming a reality. In the years since the establishment of the Soviet government, Siberia has developed from a backward agricultural region into one of the major industrial-agricultural regions of the USSR.

During the sixth five-year plan period, this very rich region will have further comprehensive development.

The policy of the party in the distribution of productive forces is aimed at fully developing and strengthening the economy and culture of each union republic.

All conditions for the further progress of the union republics in the economy, politics, and culture have been created. The materials listed in the report of the Central Committee clearly show the development of the economy and culture of the union republics.

The achievements of the union republics in this regard are indeed great. It is particularly gratifying that they have already trained a large number of local cadres who are proficient in modern technology.

The Central Committee of the Party and the government have recently taken a series of important organizational measures to strengthen the role of the union republics in economic management. New Union and Republic Departments have been established in the union republics; many industrial enterprises that were originally under the jurisdiction of the entire union, such as coal, timber, oil, steel, meat, dairy, light industry, textiles, food, building materials, automobile transportation equipment, and communication equipment, have been transferred to the departments of the union republics.

In recent years, more than 11,000 industrial enterprises that were originally under the jurisdiction of the entire union have been transferred to the management of the union republics.

In implementing all these measures, the Central Committee of the Party has followed this Leninist principle: in solving problems of economic and cultural construction, combining centralized leadership with increasing the independence of local organizations and mobilizing their initiative.

Due to the transfer of many factories from the union to the republics, the number of enterprises directly under the jurisdiction of some Union and Republic Departments has been significantly reduced. In this case, it is obvious that not only must the issue of significantly streamlining the central organs be considered, but also the issue of whether the continued existence of some Union and Republic Departments is generally appropriate.

It must be pointed out that the measures taken to prevent excessive centralization in economic management have been opposed by some leaders of the Union Departments and Union and Republic Departments, who want everything to be led by the center, as if they, "high above," could better judge the situation than the leaders of the union republics.

The measures taken by the party and government to improve the role of the union republics in the leadership of economic and cultural construction are completely in line with the principles of our party's Leninist national policy.

The idea of establishing a Union of Free, Equal, and Sovereign States as a voluntary union of the Soviet Socialist Republics completely belongs to our party and the great founders of the Soviet state, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. He proposed, argued, and developed this idea. In fact, as early as 1922, Lenin warned against the possibility of excessive centralism and the bureaucratic tendency that could hinder the broad and comprehensive development of the initiative of the union republics.

The great Lenin's teachings are still extremely important to us today.

In the future, we should continue to resolutely implement this policy of strengthening the leadership role of the union republics in economic management and more boldly transfer the industrial enterprises under the jurisdiction of the entire union to the jurisdiction of the republics.

This will make our leadership of the economy and culture more specific and flexible and will help to further strengthen the fraternal cooperation between the republics. In addition, the measures taken by the party to eliminate excessive centralism and strengthen the role of the union republics in economic management mean establishing closer contact between state organs and the masses and are another important step in the development and consolidation of our multinational socialist state.

When we organize the leadership of enterprises in the republics, as Comrade Lazakov, Secretary of the Kirghiz Communist Party Central Committee, pointed out here, we should not blindly imitate the forms of the union.

The establishment of Union and Republic Departments that manage only a small number of enterprises is not only the case in Kirghizia. For example, the Tajik Republic established a light industry department with a total of 27 people, managing only 6 enterprises. The textile industry department of the Turkmen Republic manages 10 enterprises. The Moldavian Republic has a forestry department with 32 people, managing only 8 enterprises, including 4 forest industry administrations, two of which are in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and Ukraine.

The Councils of Ministers of the union republics and the Union Departments must carefully study this issue, eliminate the phenomenon of too many organizations, and decide whether it is appropriate to establish this or that department in each republic. I fully agree with the proposal made in Comrade N. S. Khrushchev's report: to establish an authoritative joint organization of the republics—the Economic Commission of the USSR Supreme Soviet Nationalities Council—to make considerate decisions on issues related to the economic interests of the union republics, thereby better and more fully meeting the needs of the republics.

The draft directive of the sixth five-year plan stipulates that the economy of the union republics should be greatly expanded. When formulating the draft directive of the sixth five-year plan, the Central Committee of the Party proceeded from the consideration that the directive should only stipulate the basic tasks of their industry and agriculture.

The Central Committees of the Communist Party and the Councils of Ministers of the union republics should, on the basis of the directive of the congress, draw up more detailed measures for economic and cultural construction for the current five-year period and draft their respective five-year development plans.

During the sixth five-year plan period, the economy and culture of our union republics must further flourish.

After the tasks of further developing the national economy of each republic and improving the geographical distribution of productive forces are completed, the economy of each republic will be able to reach a higher level, and the strength of the multinational Soviet state will be further strengthened, and the friendship and brotherly cooperation between the peoples of the USSR will be consolidated.

Comrades! The victory of the sixth five-year plan depends on the people—the workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, and their selfless labor. When formulating the draft directive, the Central Committee of the CPSU considered the suggestions of tens of thousands of workers and collective farmers. The patriotic initiative and various production experiences of our urban and rural laboring people who actively participated in the drafting and discussion of the five-year plan helped the Central Committee to formulate the tasks of the development of various sectors of the economy in the five-year plan more comprehensively and to uncover the huge potential of our socialist industry and agriculture.

You all know that the draft directive of the congress was published in our newspapers a month before the congress. During this month, this draft directive was discussed enthusiastically and seriously at the party congresses and representative meetings, at the meetings of party activists, and at the meetings in factories, collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms.

The Central Committee, the Council of Ministers of the USSR, the State Planning Commission, and various newspapers received a large number of letters from workers, collective farmers, engineering and technical personnel, teachers, doctors, students, retired workers, and military personnel regarding various issues of the sixth five-year plan.

In these letters, there were many discussions on improving labor organization and increasing the wages of low-paid workers. There were also many suggestions regarding the improvement of the cultural and welfare of the laboring people, the pension system, and medical care, as well as suggestions for the beautification of cities, towns, and industrial areas. All these suggestions were made out of concern for the socialist national economy, science, culture, and national education.

Our working people unanimously support the magnificent plan to vigorously develop the economy of the USSR during the sixth five-year plan period, they have discussed the draft directive, uncovered new huge potential in the national economy, exposed and correctly criticized shortcomings, and suggested methods for further improving all our work.

Everyone knows that the directive of the congress only generally outlines the basic tasks of the development of the national economy of the USSR in the next five years. On the basis of this directive, the five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the USSR will be formulated, which will give the various departments and supervisory bodies more detailed indicators for each year of the plan. When formulating the five-year plan of the entire USSR and the five-year plans of the union republics, the valuable suggestions of the working people, party organizations, factories, collective farms, state farms, and machine-tractor stations should be considered.

The nationwide socialist competition launched to welcome the 20th Party Congress once again shows how many talented people our country has and how valuable the experience of advanced workers is.

The task of all party, government, trade union, and Komsomol organizations is to give all possible help and encouragement to the creative enthusiasm of the masses, to fully develop and effectively guide the socialist competition for the completion and overfulfillment of the tasks of the sixth five-year plan that is unfolding in all economic sectors. We must use competent leadership, the correct selection of cadres, systematic checks on the implementation of resolutions—that is, use the entire organizational work of our party—to consolidate and support the enthusiasm and creativity of millions of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals.

During the previous five-year plans, the Communist Party has shown excellent leadership and organizational work. There is no doubt that the party will now prove itself capable of its tasks.

The goal of organizational work should first be to strengthen state discipline, promote the latest scientific and technological achievements, widely promote advanced experience, and increase labor productivity.

Our economy and its various sectors are developing and improving every year. New, increasingly complex machines are being used on a large scale. Therefore, in the current situation, in order to organize and direct production effectively, one must have specialized knowledge and study all details in depth. Only those who have these conditions can carry out specific and skilled leadership.

Any responsible person who does not closely connect with the masses and rely on the masses cannot work smoothly. People must pay close attention to every criticism, must overcome shortcomings immediately after discovering them, and must actively support production innovators, inventors, and rationalizers.

The spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, the rock-solid unity of our people around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, the further strengthening of the alliance of the working class and collective farmers, and the brotherly friendship of the peoples of our country are the guarantees of our continued advance towards the great goal—communist society.

The tasks set by the party for the sixth five-year plan prove the great power of the Soviet system, which provides limitless opportunities for the development of social production and the improvement of the material well-being of the people.

The draft directive on the sixth five-year plan reflects the wishes and will of all Soviet citizens. They see in each task of this great document the party and government's constant concern for the well-being of the people. They know that the implementation of this new plan will mean another step forward in the development of the socialist economy, in the production of abundant consumer goods—in the great cause of building communism.

Comrades, the sixth five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the USSR will not only have great significance for our own country but will also have great significance internationally. Our party and the Soviet state, the great founders of which were V. I. Lenin, predicted that the farther we go, the greater the influence of the Soviet state, first of all its economic policy, on the historical process of the world, on the fate of mankind. This prediction has been confirmed.

The economic and cultural achievements of the USSR have won millions of friends for the Soviet people around the world. Because the peoples of the world regard these achievements as evidence of the peaceful intentions of the USSR, as proof of the great power and superiority of the socialist economic system, which provides limitless opportunities for the development of productive forces for the benefit of the working people.

As for some elements in the capitalist countries, for them, each of our five-year plans is an unpleasant but very real fact, a fact that they have to consider. There is no doubt that our several five-year plans have made many hotheads sober up and have cooled down the warmongering fervor of many spokesmen of the capitalist world.

Each new five-year plan has strengthened the position of socialism and the power of the Soviet state. Therefore, it is quite natural that our previous five-year plans have always aroused such intense interest among an increasing number of our friends, and also always aroused such intense interest among our enemies.

The draft directive of the 20th Congress of the CPSU on the sixth five-year plan has also aroused enthusiastic reactions, but this is different from the reactions aroused by the publication of our previous five-year plans. Many of you must still remember what the bourgeois newspapers and politicians and economists of the capitalist world said about our previous five-year plans. They called these plans "fantasies," "utopias," "propaganda tricks"; they shouted that these plans were doomed to failure. Indeed, after these plans were successfully implemented, their tone changed: panic replaced ridicule and gloomy predictions. And now, when we enter the sixth five-year plan period, even those who are most frank in their hostility to us do not doubt the feasibility of our goals, nor do they predict the failure of our plans. They even say that the sixth five-year plan will be completed, and they are very alarmed by this prospect. What particularly troubles the bourgeois newspapers and some groups in the capitalist countries is that the sixth five-year plan means a great step forward in the implementation of the basic economic tasks of the USSR.

As for our friends—the great Chinese people and the laboring people of all people's democratic countries—they unanimously enthusiastically support the draft directive on the sixth five-year plan. This is understandable because the successful implementation of this five-year plan will not only strengthen the USSR but also strengthen the entire socialist world system and will help all people's democratic countries achieve new great victories in socialist construction.

It is gratifying to see that our friends from India, Burma, and Afghanistan deeply understand the peaceful nature of our economic goals.

The magnificent plans for the economic construction of the USSR are derived from the nature of our economic and social system and from our thoughts of striving for lasting peace and friendship between all countries and peoples.

Due to the consistent implementation of the peaceful policy by the countries of the socialist camp, the international tension that has existed for several years has eased to a certain extent, and the prospect of consolidating world peace has emerged.

Our proposals for consolidating peace are not always met with a favorable response in the countries that receive our proposals. We regret this, but we are still determined to constantly seek new ways to international cooperation. We will continue to consistently and unwaveringly implement Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence, firmly believing that this is the only way to greatly strengthen international trust and lasting peace.

We will further strengthen our fraternal friendship and cooperation with all people's democratic countries to promote our common interests. We will continue to strive to improve relations with the United States, Britain, France, and other countries; we will expand and strengthen friendly cooperation with the Republic of India, Burma, Afghanistan, and with all countries that want to maintain and consolidate peace; we will expand economic relations with all countries through the maximum development of mutually beneficial trade.

Comrades, the tasks set by the Central Committee of the Party for the sixth five-year plan period are enormous. To complete these tasks, the entire party and the entire people must make great efforts and work hard. If one thinks that after the tasks are set and explained, everything else will be easily and simply resolved, one is mistaken. Such a situation does not exist in real life. There will be many difficulties in the implementation of the plan. However, there is no doubt that we can overcome these difficulties and successfully complete all the tasks set by the party. We have all the necessary conditions and possibilities to do this.

We have all the necessary natural resources, and the amount is sufficient.

We have the powerful production base established by our people with great effort during the previous five-year plans.

We have a large number of scientists and expert cadres who can solve the most complex scientific and technological problems.

Our peaceful and constructive labor is reliably guarded by our brave armed forces.

Our heroic working class and glorious collective farmers, our excellent intellectuals are united by an unbreakable unity of will and purpose, they are full of creative abilities and deeply believe in their strength.

The Soviet people have such a tested and wise leader as our glorious Communist Party, which is armed with the great and immortal teachings of Marxism-Leninism, which inspires us and illuminates the road to a brilliant future—communism. (Prolonged applause, everyone stands up.)

    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于1956年——1960年苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划的指示的报告
    （1956年2月21日在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上）
    尼·亚·布尔加宁
    同志们：党中央委员会把关于1956年——1960年苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划的指示草案提交苏联共产党第二十次代表大会审查。
    在说明第六个五年计划的目的以前，必须详细谈一谈第五个五年计划的结果，并且就此谈到我们的经济政策中的一些原则性的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在中央委员会的总结报告中生动地说明了我们国家自从党第十九次党代表大会以来所取得的成就。这段时期包括上一个五年计划时期的很大一部分时间。
    这个报告除了深刻地分析了苏联的国际环境和国内状况以及我们党的活动以外，还在适当的时候正确地和适时地提出了并且深入地和全面地探讨了极其重要的马克思列宁主义理论的问题
  ——社会主义世界体系和资本主义世界体系和平共处的问题、现时代避免战争的可能性问题和不同国家向社会主义过渡的形式的问题。
    伟大的列宁给我们遗留下了无可估量的思想宝藏；他确定了建设新社会制度的方式和方法。但是，他经常要求他的学生不要做党的思想遗产的消极保管者，而要通过对社会发展的新条件和新的历史事实的分析创造性地发展它，丰富它，要科学地总结正在建设共产主义的群众的经验。
    从政策的科学论证的观点来看，列宁认为对阶级力量的对比和每个历史时机的具体特点要有确切的、客观的估计是绝对必要的。列宁在他在1917年4月所写的著名的“论策略”中批评了那些拘泥于旧的理论主张和公式、只有向后看而不向前看的教条主义者；他指出：“……必须领会这个无可争辩的真理，即马克思主义者应该考虑活生生的生活，确切的实情，而不应该继续拘守昨日的理论；这种理论同任何理论一样，最多只能指出基本的和一般的要点，只能大约大体上把握住复杂的生活。”（列宁全集第二十四卷第二十六页）
    马克思列宁主义理论的巨大力量过去和现在都在于它永远能够同生活一同前进，永远能够解答社会发展过程所提出的新问题。
    对列宁和列宁主义者说来，马克思主义理论永远是行动的指南而不是教条。
    从列宁的这个基本要求的观点来看，中央委员会的报告是大胆地阐明马克思列宁主义的迫切问题的一个范例，这些迫切的问题在目前的情况下，对于我们的党以及兄弟共产党和工人党具有巨大的理论上和实践上的重要性。
    中央委员会的报告为我们党将来的工作提供了一个广泛的纲领，这个纲领贯串着对于我们正在为之努力的伟大事业——共产主义事业——的胜利的深刻而坚定的信心。在就这个报告进行讨论的时候大家的意见完全一致，而且都热烈支持中央委员会的政治路线和实际工作，这个事实证明了我们的党的磐石般的团结和强大的力量。
    中央委员会在过去几年中完成了有成效的工作，这是由于中央委员会坚定不移地遵循了列宁关于在我们的党内实行集体领导的指示。
    党中央委员会和它的主席团坚决地谴责了个人崇拜这种同马克思列宁主义的精神不相容的作法，在采取一切决定的时候实行了集体领导的原则，不管这种决定是关于国际政治的，是关于我国的国内情况的或者是关于我们的党内生活的问题。一切重要的决定都是在透彻地和批判地交换意见的基础上作出的。
    遵守列宁主义的集体领导原则和党的生活的准则，还可以保证党在以后不犯严重的错误，并且将保证我们在共产主义建设中得到新的成就。
    我们党的力量的泉源是它同广大群众不可分割的联系。苏联人民知道，党现在是而且始终是把人民的福利、把我们伟大祖国的繁荣放在其他一切之上的。这就是苏联人民对他们的党具有无限信任和满怀信心地追随党沿着胜利的共产主义建设道路前进的原因。
    在苏联共产党看来，对它的活动再没有比广大人民群众的这种无限信任和支持更高的赞许了。另一方面，人民的信任给我们党一个巨大的义务。我们的责任是不要因为我们的成就而得意洋洋，不要沾沾自喜和心满意足，而要工作得更好，要同人民保持更加密切的联系。
    由于英雄的苏联人民的忘我劳动和我们党的巨大组织工作，我们在发展国民经济一切部门方面取得了巨大的成就。第十九次党代表大会通过的关于第五个五年计划的指示已经胜利完成，而且在许多重要方面已经超额完成了。
    如果说我们没有经过努力、没有同困难搏斗而轻易地简单地赢得了这种伟大胜利，那是错误的。党揭露了若干经济建设方面——在工业方面，在更大的程度上在农业方面——的重大缺点。它大胆地、公开地告诉人民这些缺点，激发起群众的创造性和主动性的巨大力量，以便更快地消除这些缺点，使社会主义国民经济各部门中存在的巨大的内部潜力发挥出来。
    依靠了我国光荣的工人阶级和我国工程技术人员的劳动积极性，党在第五个五年计划期间使得社会主义工业获得了进一步的强有力高涨。五年计划增加工业生产量的任务是比原定时间提前完成了——在四年零四个月中完成了。在过去这一个五年计划期间，像在以前的所有五年计划期间一样，我们的经济发展是以优先发展重工业为基础的，重工业的生产量增加到比五年计划所规定的目标更大的程度。五年计划的消费品生产的指标也超过了。
    在过去这个五年计划期间，农业发展得比第十九次党代表大会的指示中所规定的为慢，五年计划的农业指标没有完成。在1955年多亏实行了苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议所规划的措施，农业生产量开始增加了。我们现在有充分的把握可以认为，我们已经创造了使国民经济的这个重要部门也获得迅速进展的必要条件。
    第五个五年计划关于铁路、海洋和汽车运输货运周转量的指标超额完成了。
    关于国民经济中的基本投资的五年计划已经完成。投资逐年都在大量增加，从而为继续扩大社会生产和提高人民生活水平奠定了基础。
    五年计划中关于国民收入、工人、职员和其他工作人员的实际工资以及集体农民的收入的目标已经被超过了，关于零售贸易的计划已经超额完成。去年零售贸易的货物周转额等于1940年的两倍以上。在这五年期间，零售价格减低了26％，超过了第十九次党代表大会指示中规定的目标。
    在上一个五年计划期间，住宅建筑的规模非常大。单是用政府按计划指拨的资金就建筑了居住面积达10，500万平方公尺的房屋。此外，用企业的资金和其他非中央的资金以及城市居民用自己的钱或者在政府贷款的帮助下建筑起来的房屋的数量也很大。在这五年期间，集体农民和农村知识分子建筑了两百万幢以上的房屋。虽然房屋问题仍旧很尖锐，但是国内的居住设备已经有了可观的扩充。
    在过去五年期间，在文化方面取得了很大的成就。第十九次党代表大会的指示规定在各共和国的首都和各大城市中过渡到普及中等教育，这个规定基本上已经实现了。我们的高等学校培养了一大批的专门人材。
    苏联的科学获得了进一步的巨大成就，它在经济和文化发展方面起了更大的作用。我们的科学在国际上的威信提高了，苏联科学家和其他国家科学家之间的接触扩大了和加强了。
    根据第五个五年计划，建立了许多新的医院、休养所、疗养院和儿童福利机关。在这段时期内，我国的出生率很高，死亡率不断下降，现在已经降低到不到1940年死亡率的一半。
    在对外贸易方面，苏联在过去五年期间继续奉行在互利的基础上同一切国家扩大经济关系的政策。去年，我国对外贸易总额约为1950年的两倍。我们同人民民主国家的贸易关系扩大了和加强了。在1955年，我们和这些国家的贸易总额达到195亿卢布，1950年是106亿卢布。
    同某些资本主义国家的贸易是在不利的条件下进行的。美国以及在美国压力下的若干西欧国家实行歧视措施来限制、甚至制止同苏联贸易。尽管如此，许多资本主义国家对于把它们的货物卖给我们和向我们买的货物仍然极感兴趣，我们同它们的贸易非但没有减少，反而大大增加了。
    由于有效地执行了第五个五年计划，我们的国家在从社会主义到共产主义的逐步过渡中，向前跨进了一大步。苏维埃国家的经济和防御力量大大增强了，它的国际地位加强了。
    在第五个五年计划期间，苏联不仅在经济和文化发展方面，而且在执行它的和平外交政策方面，在设法缓和国际紧张局势和促进世界和平方面也都取得了杰出的成就。
    伟大的社会主义阵营变得更加强大了，更加团结了。已经走上了社会主义道路的国家正在根据政府的计划顺利地发展它们的经济。伟大的中国人民正在热情地、生气蓬勃地实现他们的第一个五年计划。
    欧洲的人民民主国家——波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚还有德意志民主共和国正在完成和超额完成它们的长期发展计划。蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国在发展它们的经济方面取得了显著的进展。
    南斯拉夫人民正在沿着社会主义建设的道路胜利前进。
    第五个五年计划的成就使得苏联人民、使得我们忠实的朋友——社会主义阵营各国的劳动人民以及整个进步人类深感高兴。这些成就是由于勤劳的苏联人民在以列宁主义的中央委员会为首的共产党的鼓舞和领导下进行了伟大和积极的努力而取得的。
    （一）第六个五年计划的主要任务
    弗·伊·列宁留给我们的一个著名指示说，没有一个目的在于保证重大的成就的长远计划就不可能工作。我们在拟订和执行五年计划方面的实践就是遵循列宁的这个指示。
    生活证明我们的计划是切实可行的。每过五年，苏联就提高到更高的经济发展水平，就更加富强，它的国际威望就更高。社会主义计划经济的优越性使我们能够在经济和文化建设方面为我们自己规定越来越巨大的任务。
    苏联在开始第六个五年计划的时候，拥有一种强有力的、全面发展的社会主义生产制度，拥有丰富的物质资源，特别宝贵的是，在城市和乡村中有无数熟练的工作人员。
    我们的国家既然拥有强大的重工业，就具有一切条件来不但迅速发展生产资料的生产，而且迅速发展消费品的生产，以便大大增加它的社会财富，从而在建设共产主义社会的道路上迈进一步。
    苏联第六个五年计划的主要任务是：在优先发展重工业、不断改进技术和提高劳动生产率的基础上，进一步大力发展国民经济各部门，迅速发展农业生产，并且在这个基础上，大大提高苏联人民的物质和文化水平。
    第六个五年计划是建立在科学的基础上，并且符合于支配着社会主义生产方式发展的客观经济规律的需要。
    像以前一样，在社会主义经济的发展中起领导作用的将是工业——主要是重工业，即生产资料的生产。如果不比较快地发展重工业，要保证国民经济各部门的扩大再生产是不可能的。
    如果不优先发展重工业，就不能够保证在国民经济的各个部门中扩大再生产，不能够保证不断地提高技术、蒸蒸日上地发展生产力和不断地提高劳动生产率，就不能够保证我们的国家具有不可摧毁的防御能力以及提高人民的物质福利。这是马克思列宁主义的政治经济学所教导的，并且得到我们的社会主义国家发展的全部历史经验的证明。
    由于坚决地和不断地执行优先发展重工业的这一列宁主义的总路线，我们已经取得了世界历史性的胜利，这个胜利就是，我们已经把自己过去的落后的农业国变成了拥有高度机械化的大农业的头等工业国，我们已经建成了社会主义社会，并且正在满怀信心地逐步向共产主义迈进。
    各个生产部门中技术的空前迅速的发展，是我们时代的特征。十九世纪主要是蒸汽的时代，而二十世纪——电气时代正在开始变为蕴藏着发展生产力的无穷潜力的原子能的时代。我们共产党人应当使二十世纪最伟大的发现——原子能，充分服务于我们党的最终纲领性目标——建设共产主义的事业。在和平利用原子能方面，我们的国家走在其他国家的前头。我们将来仍然必须巩固这一领先的作用。
    关于加速工业中的技术进步和提高劳动生产率的问题，大家知道，在中央委员会去年7月全会上就极其尖锐地提出来了。中央全会的决议也反映在关于第六个五年计划的指示草案中，在这个文件里提出了保证国民经济各部门技术迅速进步并且在这一基础上最大限度地提高劳动生产率的任务。
    第六个五年计划的主要任务之一是使农业急剧高涨。
    为了充分满足居民在粮食方面以及轻工业和食品工业在原料方面日益增长的需要，我们应当比第五个五年计划更快得多地发展农业。我们应该急剧提高谷物、工业原料作物、马铃薯、蔬菜、畜产品的生产。
    工业、农业、运输、贸易、整个国民经济的进一步大发展，技术的迅速进步和劳动生产率的提高，这些就是将使我们有可能在新五年计划中胜利实现社会主义生产的主要目标的主要条件，这个目标就是：不断提高人民的物资福利和文化水平。新五年计划的实现将是解决苏联基本经济任务的一个重要阶段，这个任务就是要在历史上一个短短的时期内，在和平的经济竞赛的道路上，使生产量在按人口计算方面赶上并且超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    这个问题的渊源在于革命前地主—资本家的俄国的整个社会经济制度历史性地远远落后于当时的先进国家。
    列宁远在十月革命以前就在“灾祸临头和防止之法”的一篇文章中非常尖锐地强调指出，必须在经济方面赶上和超过最发达的国家。在社会主义革命以后，这个任务反映在列宁关于发展重工业的一系列指示中，列宁认为发展重工业是国家整个生产力的高涨和把我们祖国变为经济上强大的国家的必要条件。
    苏联在实现头两个五年计划以后已经变成了先进的工业国，按工业总产量计算，它当时已经跃居世界第二位。这样就造成条件，使得1939年3月召开的第十八次党代表大会能够规定出这样一个任务：在经济方面、就是在工业产量按人口计算方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    希特勒德国对苏联的进攻、强加于我们的沉重的战争给我国的国民经济带来了巨大的损失，使苏联在解决这个基本经济任务方面中断了十年到十一年。
    现在，当我们的经济不仅恢复了战前的水平，而且远远地往前推进了的时候，我国人民将在不同于第二次世界大战以前的那些条件下来解决基本经济任务了。现在环境已经不同了，对我们更加有利了。苏联的物质技术基础大大地加强了。只要举这样一个例子就可以明白：去年我国工业总产值已经增加到1939年（即在实际上提出了基本经济任务的那一年）的三倍半。苏联由于经济实力一年比一年加强，绝对产量已经远远地超过了欧洲最发达的资本主义国家。
    当然，我们的党在提出要在经济方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家这项任务的时候，是考虑到这些国家的经济在战后也并没有停滞不前这个情况的。在美国，工业总产值大约已经增加到战前的两倍。其他资本主义国家的生产也有所增长。我们知道，这种增长是由一些暂时的因素所决定的，它是片面性的和非常不稳定的，生产有增加的主要是那些同经济的军事化有着某些联系的工业部门，它不能够消除资本主义生产方式所固有的主要矛盾，而且相反，正在使这些矛盾尖锐起来。这一切都是无可争辩的。但是，我们应当明确，为了完成苏联的基本经济任务，我们要把生产增长的规模，比战前大大扩大才行。
    现阶段在解决苏联的基本经济任务方面的特征还在于，和战前时期不同，现在我们的国家是在这样一个伟大的历史时代解决这一任务的：在这个时代中，已经不是一个社会主义国家单独地在同资本主义世界进行竞赛，而是两个世界体系——社会主义体系和资本主义体系在进行和平的经济竞赛。
    欧洲和亚洲几乎有一半左右的人口已经最后地和彻底地摆脱了资本主义。占全人类三分之一以上的人口已经坚定地走上了社会主义建设的道路。这一事实具有极其伟大的世界历史意义。
    加入世界社会主义经济体系的国家在经济发展方面，当然各有其特点，这些特点是由各国过去的历史和每个国家的特殊条件所产生的。但是，社会主义阵营的国家在各有特点的情况下，彼此之间在根本的和主要的方面具有一个共同之点。这个共同之点就是，所有这些国家在沿着社会主义和共产主义的道路迈进；在所有这些国家中掌握政权的是同农民结成联盟的、在马克思主义的政党领导下的工人阶级。
    社会主义阵营各主权国家之间的经济关系是建筑在相互友好合作的基础之上的。这种合作的方面很广泛并且是多种多样的。它表现为：为了共同的利益最合理地利用经济资源和生产能力，把国民经济各部门的发展计划配合起来，实行生产的专业化和协作，交流科学技术成就和先进生产经验。这种友好合作和互相援助，是摆脱了危机、失业和资本主义制度所固有的其他不治之症的世界社会主义制度的日益增长和不断加强的经济实力的泉源。
    由于第二次世界大战的结果，一系列国家脱离了资本主义体系，这大大缩小了资本主义关系的统治范围。
    意义特别重大的还有，我们亲眼看着帝国主义殖民制度正在崩溃，列宁曾经很敏锐地预见到帝国主义殖民制度的不可避免的瓦解。
    可见，在同资本主义的经济竞赛中，苏联以及整个社会主义阵营拥有巨大的优越性。有决定意义的优越性就在于：社会主义的经济制度为技术的发展、生产力的发展、为千百万劳动人民——社会的全部物质财富和精神财富的创造者——的天才和能力的发挥提供了极广泛的可能性。要使这些巨大的、真正无限的可能性尽量利用，就必需坚决改善和改进我们党、苏维埃和经济机构领导工业、运输业、农业的全部工作。弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁曾经热烈希望在我们的各次代表大会上会有更多的工程师和农学家发言，希望代表大会和会议成为检验经济成绩的地方，使我们能在这里好好地学习经济建设。党和苏联人民已经把列宁的这一愿望实现了。
    同志们，请看看我们这次代表大会，请看看讨论中央委员会总结报告的那种实事求是和具体的精神，请看看代表们在发言中是如何周密地在研讨工业和农业工作中的一些实际问题。
    这是同党和党的中央委员会所进行的巨大的组织工作有关系的，中央委员会近几年来以很大的努力号召我们的干部把注意力转移到生产经济问题上，转移到研究先进经验和大规模推广这种经验的问题上。更加具体一些！这个列宁的原则现在比任何时候都更具有决定性意义。这就是目前我们整个经济领导工作的中心环节。
    共产党和全体苏联人民坚信，在两种制度的历史竞赛中，比较先进的社会主义制度必然获胜。但是，胜利当然不是自己来到的。要取得胜利，我们必需在今后继续高速度地发展国民经济的一切部门，在技术改进和提高劳动生产率方面走在其他国家前面，不断地改进我们日常的组织工作。
    完成第六个五年计划的任务就可以把苏联的经济实力提到更高的水平，同时可以促使伟大的社会主义阵营各国的经济得到进一步的发展，加强整个世界社会主义经济体系。
    （二）第六个五年计划中苏联国民经济的发展
    工业方面的任务
    国民经济各部门的进一步高涨，首先依靠社会主义工业的迅速发展。
    指示草案规定在第六个五年计划中工业产量增加65％。这就意味着，在1960年，即第六个五年计划的最后一年，我国工业产量将增加到1950年的三倍，而为战前1940年的五点三倍。
    第六个五年计划在工业方面的最重要任务是，首先要推进黑色和有色金属、石油、采煤和化学各项工业的发展，保证以特别快的速度建设电力站和迅速发展机器制造业，特别是增加技术上完善的机床、锻压机、自动工具和仪器的生产。在第六个五年计划期间，生产资料（第一部类）的生产将增加大约70％。生产资料的生产同1940年比较，增加到六点六倍。
    由于重工业的强大发展和农业生产的迅速提高，有可能加速生产消费品的工业部门的发展。
    消费品的生产将增加大约60％。到1960年，消费品（第二部类）的生产增加到1940年的三倍半。
    到1960年完成第六个五年计划的时候，苏联生产的钢、电力、水泥、燃料将比英国、法国和西德目前所生产的上述各项产品的总和还要多。在工业总产值上，苏联将大大接近美国的水平。
    我们的党过去和现在一直非常重视黑色冶金业，因为国民经济各个部门的发展最终取决于它。
    在第六个五年计划期间，我们提出大大提高黑色金属的现有生产水平的任务。在1960年我们的国家将生产大约5，300万吨生铁，即为1940年的三点六倍；6，830万吨钢，即为1940年的三点七倍；5，270万吨钢材，即为1940年的四倍。
    但是问题不仅仅在于增加黑色金属的产量。在第六个五年计划期间，冶金人员应该迅速地增产合金钢、低合金钢、电炉钢和其他许多种优质金属，这些金属的增产有重大的国民经济和国防意义。还要大大地扩大金属产品的种类和增产最经济的型钢。这一切将有助于更有效地利用金属的资源，减轻机器和金属结构的重量，制造更完善的设备。
    在第五个五年计划的时期中，冶金人员花了很大的力气利用现有的联动机获得更多的金属。这产生了良好的结果，但是不应该忘记，在黑色金属业中还存在着更多的潜力。
    单是靠更好地利用现有的生产能力、使陈旧的设备现代化和改善生产工艺，冶金工人就可以在第六个五年计划期间为国家生产出计划所规定增产的生铁的三分之一以上和计划所规定增产的钢的二分之一左右。
    在第六个五年计划期间，还将认真注意发展有色冶金业。
    新的发电站和电力网、通讯电缆线路、蓄电器、铁路电气化以及国民经济的其他需要都要求有大量的铜、铅、铝。要进一步发展制造高压汽轮机、煤气涡轮机和其他机器的时候所使用的合金钢和耐热合金的生产，必须增加镍、钨、钼、铌以及其他有色金属和稀有金属的生产。按照指示草案的规定，在新的五年计划中应该迅速地发展有色金属和稀有金属的生产。在第六个五年计划期间，有色金属生产的每年平均增长额应该大大超过以前几个五年计划的生产增长额。
    要增加有色金属和稀有金属的生产，必须发展采矿基地，改进对原料的全面使用，保证更充分地从矿石中提炼金属。
    有色冶金业工作人员的重要任务是增加高纯度的有色金属和稀有金属的生产，因为电子学、无线电工程的发展以及耐热合金的生产都必须要有这种金属。
    燃料工业
    1955年，我国的燃料生产中，煤炭占65％，石油占22.5％，天然煤气占2.5％。大家可以看出，石油、特别是煤气，在燃料生产中所占的比重不大。然而，煤气和石油都是最便宜和最有效的燃料。譬如，开采天然煤气的成本是采煤的成本的八分之一。此外，石油和煤气是获得许多化学品的宝贵原料。
    因此，就作出了尽力加速石油工业和煤气工业的发展的方针。指示草案规定，1960年的煤产量要比1955年增加52％，石油产量增加91％，煤气约增加到四倍。现在苏联拥有强大的、技术装备精良的煤炭工业。
    但是，在第五个五年计划中，煤炭工业落后于国民经济的要求，以至于在以燃料供应工业和运输方面产生了困难。在苏联的欧洲部分，特别感到对煤的需要和煤的生产量之间的脱节。
    计划在1960年开采59，300万吨煤，即为1955年的一倍半。这是一个很重大的任务，这一任务的完成不光能够满足国民经济对煤的需要，而且能够增加国家对煤的储备。
    为了大大减少从东部地区远程运煤到国家的欧洲部分的数量，规定更迅速地发展顿巴斯的煤炭工业。顿巴斯在保证国家的燃料供应方面仍旧将有极重要的作用。1960年顿巴斯的煤产量将达到21，200万吨，即比1955年多7，700万吨。但是，既然顿巴斯的煤贵，开采比较困难，成本高，那末就应当在进一步发展顿巴斯煤炭工业的同时，还要利用其他的来源来扩大和加强乌克兰的动力基地。
    这样就提出了一个问题：应当在乌克兰尽量利用像基洛夫格勒附近的亚历山大、里沃夫—沃林以及第聂伯河右岸和西部各州等地的煤产地。
    我们应该尽量利用乌克兰现有的水力和天然煤气资源。
    除了现有的第聂伯和卡霍夫卡水电站以外，在第六个五年计划期间还将建成克里门楚格和第聂伯罗捷尔任斯基水电站，并且开始建筑坎涅夫发电站。还规定大力发展西乌克兰天然煤气的生产。
    政府责成国家计划委员会进一步研究利用乌克兰水力资源的问题。可能，这方面还得采取一些补充措施。
    乌克兰的水力利用和天然煤气的开采具有重大的国民经济意义，因为这将扩大国家的燃料动力资源，可以用更便宜的燃料来代替大量的昂贵的顿巴斯的煤。
    在第六个五年计划期间，将在国家的东部建设许多新的工业企业和发电站，将要铺设新的铁路。因此，炼焦煤和动力用煤的需要量就要大大增加了。
    东部地区这些煤的储藏量是非常丰富的。同苏联欧洲部分相比，在这里开矿可以花较少的投资而获得更廉价的煤，而且这里有许多矿是可以用露天开采法开采的。现在的任务是，大力发展库兹涅茨克煤区、卡拉干达煤区和东部其他煤区的煤炭工业。
    1960年石油的开采量应当达到13，500万吨，即增加到1940年的四倍半。
    我们在过去几个五年计划中已经为进一步迅速发展石油工业创造了必要的条件。许多新的大石油区已经发现，并且已经在开采，结果，石油的工业储量在战后增加到四倍以上。已经建立了强大的石油机器制造业，它能够保证给石油工业供应技术完善的装备。
    在乌拉尔，特别是在伏尔加河流域，正在有效地开采极其丰富的油矿。1960年在这些地区获得的石油，将占国内整个采油量的75％。
    我们在乌拉尔和伏尔加河流域迅速地发展石油工业，是有利的。在这些地区采油成本比旧的石油地区低三分之二到四分之三。
    但是，我们采取在国家的东部地区迅速发展石油生产的方针，并不意味着可以减少注意老石油区——给国家生产最好种类的石油的巴库和格罗兹尼。
    在第六个五年计划期间，我们应该十分注意大力发展石油加工业，应该在这一方面建设大规模的炼油厂，其生产能力应该比直到目前为止所建成的炼油厂的生产能力大两倍到四倍。这将使得炼油厂的建设更便宜得多和更快得多。
    提高采油量的重大任务，要求广泛地发展用输油管输送石油和油产品。
    第六个五年计划规定建设14，500多公里的输油管干线。输油管的运输在输送石油总重量中的比重，五年内将增加一点五倍以上。
    在第六个五年计划期间，煤气工业将得到大力的发展。五年内煤气的开采量将增加到400亿立方公尺。在斯塔夫罗波尔、哈尔科夫附近的希别林和萨拉托夫附近的斯捷普诺夫这些新的煤气产地将投入工业性的生产，在鄂毕河下游的倍里佐夫产地将准备投入生产。总长约达9，000公里的煤气管干线也将建成。
    电气化
    党中央委员会不倦地贯彻列宁关于全国电气化的指示。
    1955年苏联全部电力站生产的电力是1，700亿度，这个数目是1940年的三倍半。然而对电力的需要过去只是勉强得到满足。
    第六个五年计划规定，要保证以最快的速度增加电力站的发电量，以便充分满足国民经济对电力的不断增长的需要，并且创造发电能力的后备。五年中规定工业的总产量增加65％，而电力应当增加88％，电力站的发电能力应当增加到二点二倍。
    我国有丰富的水力资源。水电站的好处是：不需要燃料而能够供给最便宜的电力。
    在第六个五年计划期间将非常重视水电站的建设工作。水电站的发电能力在五年计划期间将增加到二点七倍。
    苏联的欧洲部分将继续进行利用伏尔加河和卡马河水力资源的工作。除了完成古比雪夫、高尔基、斯大林格勒、莫洛托夫、沃特金斯克几处水电站外，还将在伏尔加河上修建萨拉托夫和契鲍克萨利水电站，在卡马河上修建下卡马河水电站。
    西伯利亚将大规模展开建筑巨大的水电站——安加拉河上的布拉次克水电站和叶尼塞河上的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站——的工作。这两个水电站的发电能力各为320万瓩，每一个水电站每年发出的电力有古比雪夫和斯大林格勒两个水电站的总发电量那样多。打算利用西伯利亚各电力站的廉价电力来组织一些耗电量大的生产。
    至于说到火力发电站的生产，这里提出了建筑强大的电力站的任务，这些电站将安装10万、15万和20万瓩的联动机，利用高压和高温蒸气来进行生产。这种大电力站在经济上比发电能力较小的电力站更有利。在第六个五年计划中，将建筑大量的电力网。在发展苏联动力的最初年代中，把电力站联接成电力网，即所谓互连，只是在个别地区范围内进行了。随后，区的动力系统互相联接了起来，建立了区际动力系统。
    在第六个五年计划中提出了有意义的重大任务——建立苏联整个欧洲部分统一的动力系统，它将利用40万伏特电压的输电线把古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站同中部、南部和乌拉尔各动力系统联接起来。
    1960年，联成苏联欧洲部分统一动力系统的各电力站发出的电力，将约为苏联那时生产的全部电力的一半。
    在第六个五年计划中，西伯利亚中部将开始建立一个统一的动力系统。这个系统将把安加拉河和叶尼塞河上的水电站同库兹巴斯、新西伯利亚、伊尔库茨克和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克的火力发电站和水电站联接起来。
    建立统一的动力系统可以更加可靠地保证供应电力，大大改进电力站的节约指标，使得有可能建筑一些巨型电力站来代替许多不大经济的中型和小型的电力站，使目前缺电的许多新区电气化。
    第六个五年计划中突出的一点就是要广泛地建设和利用原子能电力站。指示草案规定建设一些原子能电力站，总发电能力达到200万到250万瓩，这几乎达到著名的全俄电气化计划规定建设的全部电站能力的一倍半。
    化学工业
    化学对工业和农业各部门的作用和意义越来越大了。迅速发展化学工业早就成了技术进步的必要条件。
    化学工业目前的状况不能够使我们满意，因此，第六个五年计划规定要加速发展化学工业。这个工业部门的最重要的任务之一，是要增产能提高农作物单位面积产量的矿质肥料。到1960年，矿质肥料的生产约将增加到两千万吨，这个数目是1940年的六倍半，1955年的两倍多。
    必须组织生产新的、效力更大的防治农作物病虫害用的化学药剂，以及组织大规模生产除野草的药剂，以便保证大大减少用于铲除农作物播种地上的野草的劳动。
    化学工业的重要任务是广泛发展合成酒精、合成橡胶、溶剂、油漆、颜料、质量高的肥皂代用品以及其他由石油煤气和天然煤气制成的化学品的生产。现在我们要用谷物、马铃薯和食用油脂来制造这些产品。利用石油煤气和天然煤气生产合成产品之后，在第六个五年计划中就可以大大缩减、随后可以完全停止把谷物和植物油用在工业的消耗上。
    化学工业的工作人员应该大规模地发展制造人造丝、鞋类、服饰这一类消费品所必需的原料的生产。在第六个五年计划中，计划使制造人造纤维用的合成材料的生产大约增加到六倍。
    必须扩大机器制造、无线电器材、航空用的合成材料的种类和增加它们的生产，还必须发展高质量的绝缘材料和塑料的生产，因为使用这些材料可以减轻机器和制件的重量，可以节省有色金属。
    国民经济还非常需要汽车轮胎。指示草案规定增加汽车轮胎的生产一倍，化学工业工作人员应该认为这是最低限度的任务。
    黑色和有色冶金工业、燃料和化学工业的发展要求有强大的原料基地。我国的采矿工业拥有丰富的和已经勘探出来的矿藏。按照已经勘探出来的铁矿、锰矿、铜、铅、铁矾土、镍、钨、钾盐、磷酸盐等的储量来说，苏联占世界的第一位。
    由于进行了广泛的地质勘探工作，发现了大量新的煤矿、石油矿、黑色金属、有色金属和稀有金属的矿藏以及其他矿藏。现在正在这些矿藏的基础上建筑我们重工业的大企业。
    应该对我们的地质工作者加以表扬。他们在上一个五年计划中工作得很好，获得了很好的成果。譬如在库斯坦奈州发现了新的巨大的铁矿、动力用煤和铁矾土矿，矿区非常利于工业开采。下面这点就足以说明这个发现意义的重大：根据地质和矿藏保护部的材料，库斯坦奈州铁矿的储量超过已经勘探出来的乌拉尔铁矿的储量，包括马格尼特山在内。
    指示规定以库斯坦奈的矿藏为基础建立铁矿工业，年产铁矿石1，000万吨，要建设一个巨大的铁矾土矿，一个制铝工厂，还要大规模开采动力用煤。
    在雅库特自治共和国的南部地区和贝加尔湖东岸地区发现了新的炼焦用煤和铁矿的巨大矿床。
    乌克兰东部、斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区和靠近北乌拉尔地区的一些巨大天然煤气产地的发现具有重大的意义。
    雅库特自治共和国丰富的金钢石矿的发现是最近几年来很显著的成就。
    必须进一步在各经济地区，首先是在我国东部寻找和勘探石油、天然煤气、炼焦用煤、黑色金属、有色金属和稀有金属以及其他矿物的新的产地。为了使采矿工业有更均衡的配置，为了能够用已经探得的矿物储藏来保证目前开工的和正在建设中的企业长期生产，这样做是必需的。
    机器制造业
    在中央委员会去年7月全体会议上，制造机器的几个工业部因为设计和生产在技术上完善的设备和仪器方面的落后，受到了严厉的和完全公正的批评。
    机器制造业，首先是机床制造业和工具工业的发展应当走在其他工业部门的前面。因此在第六个五年计划期间机器制造业和金属加工工业的产量规定增加80％。
    机器制造工业在新五年计划中面临着巨大的任务。应当在短短的时期内生产效能高的新设备来装备机器制造工厂。这里指的首先是金属切削机床、锻压机、铸造机、自动和半自动作业线。
    在五年中，金属切削机床的产量预定将近增加到两倍。在机床的总产量中，至少有一半是那些最先进的切削机床。例如，使得能够同时用许多切削工具加工工作物的多位联动机床的生产，预定增加到将近两倍半，供自动车间和自动工厂用的自动和半自动作业线和设备的生产约增加到五倍。
    提出的任务是：在五年计划中使锻压设备的生产增加到两倍左右、重型锻压机的生产至少增加到四倍。应当采用压力有几千吨的机械锻压机来代替旧式的自由锻锤，这样就能够采用先进的新的工艺规程来生产精密压模，大大减少单位产品的劳动量和金属的耗费。
    在铸造车间中，制模工、铸造工、凿断工的繁重的和生产率低的手工劳动必需用机器的工作来代替。为此，预定使现代化铸造设备的产量增加到八倍，并且在国内各个地区建筑大量的专业化铸造车间和工厂。
    在新技术的基础上重新装备铸造生产，就可以生产只要进行不多的机械加工的精密铸件。
    这将能够腾出成千上万的金属切削机床，并且将节省下现在变为细屑的几十万吨金属。
    机器制造业在为国民经济其他部门制造更完善的设备方面，面临着同样重要的任务。
    机器制造者应该把各种生产率高的、机械化和自动化的、达到世界技术的最好成就的水平的轧钢机来供应金属冶炼业。
    采矿工业和煤炭工业将得到新式的强力的机器。在第五个五年计划中已经制造了拉斗容量为14立方公尺的自动移动拉铲。这种机器的生产力是每小时800公方。在新的五年计划中，机器制造者应该以每小时能够挖掘1，200多公方泥土的更大的挖掘机来供应冶金工人，采煤工人和建设工人。要以载重量达40到50吨的自动卸货卡车来配合这种挖掘机的工作。在第六个五年计划中，汽车工业将生产这种大型的自动卸货卡车。
    机器制造者将要解决为火力发电站制造极大的动力设备的复杂任务。应该设计、并且生产能力达20万到30万瓩的、经济的汽轮机以及同这种汽轮机配合的、生产力为每小时900吨蒸汽的锅炉。在这些联动机中的汽压将达到300大气压，蒸汽的温度将达到650度。
    在过去五年中，动力机器制造者为古比雪夫水电站制造了能力达105，000瓩的水轮机。在第六个五年计划中，他们要制造出更强力的涡轮机。布拉次克水电站需要的涡轮机是每台能力在20万瓩以上的涡轮机。可以用下列的比较来说明这种机器的能力：五台这种水轮机的能力就等于革命前的俄国全部电力站的能力，而用这五台水轮机发出的电力为沙皇俄国全部发电量的三倍半。
    指示草案中规定，在五年中要大大增加汽轮机、水轮机、煤气涡轮机的生产，还要大大增加涡轮机用的发电机，其中包括具有30万瓩的巨大能力的和新的氢冷却装置的汽轮机的生产。
    机器制造者在设计和制造机床、机器和各种设备时，应该特别注意用改进机器的设计的办法，用采用经济型钢的办法，以及用塑料代替金属的办法来降低金属的单位消耗量。
    如果我们没有足够数量的、多种多样的和最完善的仪器和无线电工程制件，我们就不能够胜利地解决生产过程自动化这一最重要的任务。因此，在第六个五年计划中必须迅速地发展仪器制造业和无线电工程工业。
    为了扩大仪器制造工业的生产能力，要建筑32个专业化的工厂，并且要加强科学研究和实验基地。
    为了改进对这个工业部门的领导，把机器和仪器制造部分成了两个部——仪器制造和自动化工具部以及机器制造部。
    仪器制造工业最重要和最紧迫的任务之一，是保证供给科学工作和生产以足够数量的快速数学计算机，这是使计算工作和生产过程自动化的新工具。
    无线电工业的工作人员应该特别注意制造新式的上等质量的半导体仪器，这些仪器在许多情况下已经能够成功地用来代替无线电真空管。半导体仪器的体积和重量都要比无线电真空管小得多，它提高了无线电机、数学计算机和其他装置的工作可靠性。
    半导体仪器是值得加以认真研究的。但是，无线电工业部掌握这些仪器的生产的速度慢得难以容忍，而有色金属工业部为生产这些仪器而制造的化学质量很纯净的材料的数量也十分不够。
    在第五个五年计划的几年中，建筑材料的生产大大增加了。然而，它们还是不能完全满足国民经济的需要。水泥、墙壁和屋顶材料、甚至窗玻璃都很缺乏。
    为要建筑得又快、又省、又好，正如现在大家都知道的，应当广泛采用工厂化方法，更加多多地采用装配式钢筋混凝土构件，这就要求有许多水泥。
    1940年，我们生产了约600万吨水泥，1955年超过2，200万吨，而在1960年，水泥的生产计划要达到5，500万吨，可以说，美国在1955年生产了约5，200万吨水泥。
    在第六个五年计划中，装配式钢筋混凝土构件的生产将增加到约六倍，装饰材料、石板、卫生设备和其他建筑材料的生产增加到两倍多。
    木材工业
    苏联是世界上森林最丰富的国家。我们的伐木工作在大规模地进行。例如，去年采伐和运出了约3亿立方公尺的木材。
    但是我们的木材仍然不够，首先是因为我们利用得很不节省。世界上没有哪个国家像我们这里这样不爱惜木材。在100万卢布的建筑安装工作上，我们的建筑工人要耗费480立方公尺木材，而例如，在我们的朋友——人民民主国家那里，这一耗费就少得多。
    要节省木材，首先应当更广泛地采用混凝土和钢筋混凝土。
    在以木材供应国民经济方面发生间断的基本原因之一，是主要的伐木者——林业部连续没有完成计划。
    仅仅在第五个五年计划的年月里，这个部就少给国民经济将近8，000万立方公尺的经济用材。
    同时，无论过去和现在在生产基地的发展方面，林业部都经常得到帮助。在最近5年里，林业部的投资达125亿卢布。森林采伐基本操作的机械化程度大大地增加了。然而，林业部在费力的辅助操作机械化方面还是做得很坏，因此在森林工作中的很多工人还在用手工作。
    第六个五年计划规定林业部经济用材的运出量增加42％，主要是在多森林地区，并且大大地发展这些地区的制材业。
    森林工业的最重要任务是完成森林采伐工作的全盘机械化，过渡到固定工人数额的全年工作制。
    造纸工业和木材加工工业同森林工业有着密切的联系。
    第六个五年计划规定建设新的纸浆工厂、厚纸工厂和改建许多现有的纸浆和造纸企业，这样就能够大大增加纸浆和纸的生产。印刷用纸和报纸的生产量应当增加到一倍半以上，厚纸增加到二点八倍。
    从前我们修建纸浆工厂和造纸工厂多半是在森林地区，并且经由长途运输把大量的纸和厚纸运到全国各地去。在第六个五年计划里应当也在没有森林的地区建设生产纸浆和厚纸的企业，利用丰富的芦苇资源进行生产。这样就能够在我国增加大量的纸和厚纸的生产，并且减少把这些产品向远处运输的工作。
    造纸工业应当广泛地发展包装纸的生产，以便在第六个五年计划中用厚纸箱来代替一半左右的木箱。这样我们每年将节省约700万立方公尺的木材。
    在第六个五年计划中，在轻工业和食品工业的所有部门中应当解决广泛发展生产的任务。因此在保证工业品和食品的不间断的贸易方面将再迈进一大步。做到这一点的一切条件都是具备的。
    迅速发展的重工业，将以技术完善的机器、设备和装置供应轻工业的现有工厂和新建的工厂。另一方面，农业各个部门的发展，将能够急速地增加纺织业、皮鞋业、食品业、肉奶制品工业、罐头工业以及其他轻工业和食品工业部门的原料供应。
    食品工业的工作人员应该大规模地增产肉类和肉制品、油脂、干酪、牛奶和奶制品、鱼类和鱼制品、糖、糖果点心和各种罐头。因此，城市和采购农业原料的地区将要建设许多新的工厂。
    生产工业消费品的企业的工作人员面临着重要的任务。他们应该做到使鞋类和缝纫品的生产扩大到一倍半以上，大大增加亚麻织品、特别是上等的毛织品的产量，这些产品是不能充分满足目前的需求的。必须特别大规模地发展人造纤维和合成纤维的生产。在第六个五年计划期间，人造纤维的产量至少应该增加到三倍，合成纤维增加到五倍。
    应该大规模地增加这样一些商品的生产，如：钟表、自行车、机器脚踏车、缝纫机、洗衣机、无线电收音机以及其他文化用品和家庭用品。
    除扩大工业品的生产之外，轻工业工作人员还应该保证大大改进产品的质量，保证及时地生产。要使居民能够适应季节及时地买到服装、衬衣、鞋子。
    轻工业和食品工业各部门的工作人员，有责任大大改进对生产能力的利用，尽力采用先进的工艺、大大减少生产中的原料损失。
    同志们，各工业部门在第六个五年计划中的基本任务就是这样。
    工业的技术进步
    在过去的几个五年计划年代中，我们的工业生产的技术获得了极大的发展。但是目前，我们已经远远不能满足这种情况了。技术不能停留不前，而应当时时前进。我们只有广泛采用新的技术设备，才能在很短的时期内大大提高劳动生产率和增加产量。因而，指示草案在争取工业技术进一步发展方面所规定的任务具有特别重要的意义。
    中央委员会七月全体会议指出，党、苏维埃和经济机关在工业方面的最重要任务，除了完成国民经济计划以外，就是尽力提高生产的技术水平和不断地争取技术进步。
    现阶段的工业技术进步表现在什么地方呢？
    技术进步是同电气化不可分割地联系着的，它首先表现为全部机器和装备的不断改善，运用最完善的生产工艺、生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化、最充分和合理地运用现有的原料和动力资源，通过这一切不断地增加质量高的产品。
    但是，技术——机器、车床和其他装备——仅是事情的一方面。为了正确地运用这种技术、保证技术迅速进步，必须经常关怀培养高度熟练的工人、技师、工程师和科学家干部的工作，不断地发展科学和改善生产的组织。
    可以引证许多例子来表明我们在技术进步方面的巨大成就。但是，今天不该谈这个。现在应当集中力量消除这方面的缺点，保证在第六个五年计划中国民经济各个部门技术的迅速进步。
    我从我们的机器和装备问题谈起。
    在第一个和第二个五年计划中，我们的企业装备了当时最完善的设备，这些设备很大程度上是从外国输入的。从那时起已经过了20多年了。在战争时期，工业获得新设备的规模不大。战后期间，在设备方面增添了新的机床和机器，但是我们的机床中仍然还有许多老车床，它们的速度是每分钟150转到400转，而我们的新式车床的速度是每分钟1，500转到2，000转。我们感到不够的还有半自动机、自动机、新式搪床、铣床和磨床，锻压机也感到不够。
    我们工厂的铸造设备落后于现代水平。我们的机器制造业所装备的大部分铸造机器的生产能力，只有现代化的半自动和自动铸造机器的三分之一到四分之一。
    第六个五年计划里，我们必须大力更换机器制造业的金属加工设备和铸造设备、轻工业和食品工业的技术设备、运输业中的机车车辆、农业中的拖拉机和机器。
    在采用和装置新设备的同时，还应该坚决采取措施，使现有的机器现代化、提高现有设备的生产率。
    在机器和机械上装配能够减轻和加速工作的、能力更强大的发动机和设备附件，就可以大大提高机床和机器的生产率。不过，把设备加以现代化的工作还没有达到应有的规模。供给设备的各部和工厂在这件事情上很少帮助需要使设备现代化的工厂。结果，后者经常以自己的力量，以半手工业的方式来进行所有的工作。不过即使这样它们也常收到很大的成效。
    例如，国家第一球轴承制造厂改善了已经工作20多年的半自动化车床的个别零件的构造后，就使这些车床能够采用快速工作制。这样，机床的生产率提高了25％，并且大大减少了废品。
    使设备现代化是一件对国家具有极大的重要性的事情。党组织和经济组织应该加强对这一问题的重视。
    在第六个五年计划中，在推广新的、更加完善的生产工艺方面，还要进行巨大的工作。
    从下面的一些例子中就可以看出这种任务是多么重大。
    在机器制造业中，在若干企业中仍旧用泥模制造钢铁铸件，用自由锻造的方法制造锻件，这种方法是过时的，生产效能很低的。采用这种工艺，不可避免地要消耗大量的劳动，要跟着对零件进行大量的机械加工而产生许多废屑。
    同时，在若干工厂里已经采用了先进的新的铸造法和锻造法，这使劳动生产率提高好几倍，并且节省大量的金属。但是，这种新方法在生产中推广得很慢。
    另外一个例子。现在，钢液是注入铁模里的。所得出的钢锭先用初轧机轧制，随后再用型钢轧机或钢板轧机轧制。
    但是，“红色索尔莫沃工厂”和“新图拉”钢铁工厂采用了一种连续浇铸的新方法，使用这种方法，可以直接从钢液中获得制造钢材的钢坯，并且省去在铸锭模中铸造钢锭和在初轧机中轧制的操作过程。
    如果在1960年使这种先进方法的铸锭达到1，200万到1，500万吨（这是完全现实的），那么根据国家新技术委员会的统计，钢材的生产就可以增加大约100万吨，而且在这方面可以节省大约20亿卢布。
    连续浇铸所必须增加的设备的价值不到一年就可以收回来。此外，还可以消除浇铸车间工人的繁重的手工劳动，减少浇铸车间的工人数目和减少耐火材料的开支。
    还有一个例子。在黑色冶金企业中，绝大多数的马口铁是用老式的非机械化方法生产的，采用这种方法，每一吨铁的热轧、切开和分等需要约40个人小时，每吨铁的热镀锡要求用20公斤的锡。而萨坡罗什炼钢厂掌握了一种比较完善的工艺，只用冷轧和电镀方法就可以保证减少劳动量96％到97.5％，减少锡的消耗40％。
    在第六个五年计划中必须在工艺过程中广泛地运用电学和化学，大力研究在工业中进一步运用放射性幅射，特别是用于检查材料的质量和操纵生产过程。
    先进的工艺过程将能够大大提高劳动生产率、减少成本和改善产品的质量。必须在生产中更加坚决和迅速地运用先进的工艺。
    繁重和费力的工作的机械化是技术进步的重要方向之一。党和政府在过去就提出过关于尽力发展机械化的必要性的问题。在这方面我们已经作了许多的工作。但是，我们的生产机械化水平仍然不够高，手工劳动所占的比重仍然很大。
    这里谈一谈采煤工业。在战后年代里，采煤工业的确获得了大量新的技术设备，但是对于这些技术设备的运用还是存在着许多缺点。其中最严重的缺点就是全盘机械化的推广很不够，因而在工艺过程中，个别的繁重操作仍然不是机械化的。在采煤工业中，尽管有大量的挖掘机、联合机和其他机器，但是劳动生产率仍然很低，煤的成本仍然很高，原因之一就在这里。
    在许多其他的工业部门以及在运输业和建筑业中，全盘机械化的情况也不比这好。
    应当指出，全盘机械化进展缓慢的主要原因是：我们的许多生产部门还没有获得包括主要和辅助的工艺过程的必要的成套机器。在第六个五年计划中，机器制造者应当认真地着手解决这个重要的任务。
    在指示草案中着重指出必须要大力提高各种工作的机械化速度，在所有工业部门中大规模地实行主要和辅助的操作过程的全盘机械化，应当特别注意装卸工作的全盘机械化，而目前有过多的工人在从事着这种装卸工作。
    下一个比机械化更高的技术发展阶段就是生产的自动化。
    自动化的实质是：生产过程在工人消耗最少体力劳动的情况下，实现工人从繁重操作中解放出来，他的主要职责是管理生产的过程。由于自动化，一个或是几个工人就能够管理大量的机器和机械。在自动化的情况下，工人劳动的性质将会发生变化，工人的劳动越往后越将接近技师和工程师的劳动。
    广泛地运用生产自动化将为劳动生产率的空前增长开辟远景，在社会主义条件下它促进着劳动人民的文化技术水平的提高。此外，自动化可以保证改进产品质量和降低产品成本，而且可以加强生产过程的安全和连续性。
    只有依靠自动化才能够管理原子装备以及化学工业和其他工业部门的许多人所不能够直接管理的生产过程。
    自动化会产生出什么效果，我们可以从第聂伯水电站的例子中看出来。在那里，总发电能力达65万瓩的9个水轮机和水电站的一些其他机械，每一班只用6个值班人看管。
    在乌兹别克电业局奥尔忠尼启则阶梯，只有两三个值班员从一个地方管理着4个水电站。
    机器制造厂的自动化能够收到很高的经济成效。我们现代化的自动流水作业线使我们能够把工人人数减少到相当于以前的五分之一到十分之一。并且使产品加工的工作时间也减少这样多。应该在所有工业部门实行自动化。这是重工业、轻工业和食品工业所共同面临的任务。
    自动计算机在自动化事业中应该发挥特别重要的作用，这种机器能够自行决定生产过程中最有利的状况并且维持这种状况，同时能够确定和控制产品质量方面的任务。
    这样，自动化的发展就对国家具有很大的意义。但是，各个部和主管机关对这样一件重要事情还没有给予必要的重视。
    指示草案提出的任务是，在工业中大规模地实行生产过程自动化，更快地从个别联动机和操作的自动化过渡到各车间工艺过程的自动化，过渡到建立完全自动化的企业，这样就可以极大地提高劳动生产率。
    各个部和国家技术委员会必须采取更加坚决的措施在国民经济一切部门中实行自动化。
    在更换设备、改进生产的工艺、实行机械化和自动化的同时，还有这样一项任务：提高新机器、装备、器材和其他制品的质量，争取使它们跟上科学技术的最新成就，而老式的机器、装备和器材应当及时从生产中撤换掉，而拿新的来代替。应当说，在我们部分的经济学家中流行着一种反科学的理论，这种理论认为在社会主义下没有机器的无形损耗这一现象。这种有害的理论甚至渗入了“苏联大百科全书”，这种理论的宣扬者硬说，机器的“无形损耗”的现象仅仅是资本主义经济所固有的，而在社会主义经济中“技术的发达不会产生‘无形损耗’，固定基金的折旧不把无形损耗计算在内。”（苏联大百科全书第2卷第291页）
    不难看出，这种“理论”成了因循和保守的挡箭牌。它的目的是企图证明，仿佛采用不符合我国先进企业所达到的最高技术水平的陈旧设备是对社会主义社会有利的。但是，谁不知道，在采用新技术方面落后，就等于浪费社会劳动力，阻碍劳动生产率的提高。
    技术进步可以节省社会劳动力，可以使用少量的劳动生产较多的产品。
    而我们某些可怜的经济学家不去研究采用保证社会主义在同资本主义竞赛中获得胜利的新技术的有关经济效果的问题，反而认为使用陈旧的机器是社会主义经济发展的规律。
    提醒这些“经济学家”回忆一下列宁的英明的话不是多余的，列宁说：“……经济学家永远应当向前看，向技术进步的一面看，否则他马上就会落后，因为谁要是不想向前看，谁就是倒转过来背向历史：中间路线是没有的，也不可能有。”（列宁全集第5卷125页）
    在技术进步方面，科学负有特别重大的作用。
    加速技术进步的必要性，要求最广泛地开展理论研究、新的巨大的科学发现和综合先进的生产经验。在这方面我们有不少的成就。尽管这样，现在在科学面前还是有着许多新的极其重大的任务。
    当我们恰当地估计我们的科学家对发展国家经济和文化的共同事业作出的难以估计的贡献的时候，仍旧有必要指出组织和安排科学工作方面的缺点。
    例如，某些科学研究机关和个别科学工作人员多年来的工作毫无成果，这是不能令人容忍的。许多科学研究所和科学工作人员同生产的联系不够。某些科学机构的沾沾自喜和自满情绪相当严重。
    在这些科学机关中，应该通过批评和自我批评来换些新鲜空气，应该对科学问题展开创造性的讨论。只有这样，才能克服阻碍科学发展的缺点，特别是消灭某些科学家的那种垄断个别科学部门的领导的错误倾向。
    为了保证加快技术的进步，必须增加机器制造业、仪器制造业和电力工业等部门中的科学工作人员的数量。
    应该改进培养科学工作人员的工作的质量。现在已经到了大大改进通过研究员制度培养科学干部的工作，提高对于授给学位和学术的要求的时候了。总之，是对这一重要的工作加以整顿的时候了。
    许多科学机构都正确合理地提出了扩大科学研究机关负责人的权限的建议。由于这方面的制度不正确，科学研究机关的负责人现在连合理使用科学干部和拨发科学研究工作经费等起码问题也无法解决。
    在中央委员会7月全会上，我们解决了关于扩大企业负责人的权限的问题。部长会议也应该通过关于科学研究机关的负责人的类似的决议。
    为了吸收有才能的工作人员来参加科学工作，并且解除科学研究机关中那些多年来没有作出有用的、有实际价值的研究结果的人的工作，应当在各科学研究所中进行定期的考核，以调配科学工作人员的职位。
    为了把科学提到更高的水平并且扩大科学研究工作的规模，应该吸收新生力量来参加科学工作，在更广泛的战线上争取新的科学成就。应该怎么做呢？
    如果只是扩大现有的和建立新的科学研究机关，那就要花很
  多时间，这样我们是等不及的。因此，需要广泛吸收高等学校和各工业部的设计实验局来进行科学研究工作。应该真正巩固和广泛利用高等学校和设计实验局的实验室，利用工业部门的实验室，来做科学研究工作。采用这个办法可以在短期内扩大国内科学研究的战线，并且大大提高科学干部的熟练程度。
    在本科学部门中以及在各有关的科学部门之间，经常广泛地交换工作情况，对于科学工作具有重大的意义。不广泛交换意见，科学便不能发展。然而，在很多问题上，这种交换却由于资料的过分保密而发生困难。不合理的保密制度造成科学工作中的重复现象，有时竟使不尽职的工作人员得以逃避科学的批评。当然，对于真正需要保密的东西，我并不主张把它公开。应当合理地组织我们的各个科学机关之间的经验、意见和科学情报的交流，加强各个科学研究机关之间的相互联系，并且加强它们同外国的科学研究机关和进步的科学家的联系。应该更多地购买外国的技术书籍并且在苏联出版，改进各部、各科学研究所和各企业的技术通报工作，整顿交流先进经验的工作。
    我国现有的科学机构系统，共约有3，000个科学院、部门研究所、科学研究实验室和其他科学研究机关，但是，它从来没有被作为一个整体来仔细加以研究，而且它显然不是一个最合理的、经济的和有效率的系统。在中央委员会的总结报告中正确地指出，我国的科学研究所和高等学校不合理地过分集中在国家的中部，特别集中在莫斯科。我附带可以举出下列一些突出的材料。
    在莫斯科、列宁格勒和在莫斯科州及列宁格勒州内，各部和各主管机关的科学研究所占它们的总数三分之一以上，苏联科学院的科学机关占总数三分之二。在这些机关中，集中了60％以上的各部和各主管机关的科学工作人员、85％的科学院的科学工作人员。
    苏联有色冶金工业部的科学研究所，有三分之二设在莫斯科和列宁格勒，在化学、木材、造纸和木材加工等工业部门中，情况大致也是这样。
    例如，苏联钢铁工业部的所有耐火材料研究所都设在列宁格勒。苏联消费合作总社的全部狩猎业研究所、苏联农业部的全部养马研究所、苏联国营农场部的全苏皮毛鹿茸牲畜科学研究所全都设在莫斯科和莫斯科附近，此外还有其他一些类似的机关在莫斯科和列宁格勒也都设有生产基地。许多高等学校的情况也是这样。
    各个部、国家计划委员会、国家技术委员会和苏联科学院应该对改善苏联科学院系统、高等学校和各工业部科学研究所的科学研究工作的组织有关的问题进行研究并且加以解决，特别是应该对更合理地分布科学研究所和高等学校、使它们接近生产基地的问题提出自己的意见。
    在我们国家里，存在着进一步发展科学的最有利的条件。我们拥有大批的高度熟练的科学工作人员，他们满怀热忱，想真正帮助发展国民经济和积极参加建设共产主义社会。只不过需要妥善地和正确地组织这批巨大的力量，需要对我们的科学干部给以经常的帮助。
    指示草案中所规定的关于工业技术进展的广泛计划的实现，大部分将决定于工业专业化和协作的程度。
    只有在连续流水生产的条件下大规模地生产同一种类的产品，才能够最有效地利用现代的高效率技术。专业化和协作可以达到这个目的。
    在前几个五年计划期间，我们的工业在专业化方面已经获得了一定程度的进步。可是在这方面有许多缺点。去年7月的中央委员会全体会议详细地批评了这些缺点并且提出了扩大工业中的专业化和协作的重大措施。
    在全体会议以后，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议采取了一些实际措施使各个部配合得更好地专业化起来，同时把同一类型的货品的生产集中在它们的企业之中。这适用于柴油机、仪器和某些其他产品的生产。但是这是不够的。
    某些部的首长和许多工厂的厂长害怕专业化和大规模的协作，因为要这样做就需要改变既定的生产组织形式。
    也有一些领导人希望把专业化的工作推迟到将来再做，把专业化应用到将要建设的新的专业化工厂方面，而现有的工厂则继续完全像以前一样地进行生产。
    我们不能让这种情况继续下去。我们必须积极地执行工业中大规模专业化和协作的政策，合理地组织企业之间的生产联系，在执行协作交货计划方面严格遵守国家的纪律。
    指示草案规定了实行生产专业化的广泛措施。机器制造工业是第一个需要整顿的工业。同一种类型的机器的生产直到今天还由不同的部和主管机关在管理着。
    许多部和主管机关的工厂制造着完全不属于它们的生产范围的非常重要的货品。例如，农业部就生产着全国生产的全部金属切削机床的10％左右，和锻压机器的24％。这个部的工厂所出产的机器在技术上常常是落后的，生产成本很高，因为它们是一小批一小批地生产出来的，而工艺规程是不完善的。
    大量的铸件、锻件、金属部件、刀具和其他大规模使用的产品都是由许多工厂自己生产的，这样生产的费用非常昂贵，并且不能保证产品的良好质量。这是因为没有专业化的翻砂厂和锻压机器厂，以及因为金属品和刀具制造工业发展得不够充分，电极配件和冲模的专业化生产也是一样。
    有些工业经理人员认为，专业化的唯一目的是减少产品的品种，这是不正确的。随着技术的进步，产品的品种和类型的数量增加的速度比新工厂的数量要增加得快得多。
    目前的任务是，必须是使每一所工厂都生产按工艺规程来说是同类的产品，力求零件和部件产品的规格划一和在专业化工厂内组织它们的大规模生产。
    我们在列宁的著作中可以找到关于专业化生产的进步作用的话。他写道：“要把制造整个产品的某一部分的人类劳动的生产率提高，就必须使这部分的生产专业化，使它成为一种制造大量产品因而可以（而且需要）使用机器等等的特种生产。”（列宁全集第1卷第84页）。
    指示草案规定在国内各经济地区设立专业化工厂和车间来生产铸件、锻件、冲模、标准刀具、备件、木制和塑胶制品、巩固用具以及其他物品。还打算设立专业化工厂来生产自动作业线和机械化装备。
    各工业部门必须合理地分配给哪一部管辖，制造同一类型产品的工厂必须集中在同一个部中，这首先适用于制造金属切削机床、锻压装备和涡轮机的工厂。
    中央委员会认为，为了促进全国各经济地区和大工业中心的工业专业化和协作，必须拟订一项远景计划。各加盟共和国、边疆区和州的党、政府和经济组织必须积极参加这个计划的制定工作。
    在工业中取得进一步发展的计划需要在发掘一切工业企业的潜在能力和充分加以利用方面做很多的工作。在某些工业部门，生产能力并没有得到充分的利用。许多工厂极度缓慢地把它们的规定的全部能力投入生产，它们的装备的使用效率很低，而且经常让装备闲置起来。
    各工业部和工厂经理并没有采取必要措施来保证和谐地生产、减少工作时间的损失或是有效地利用它们的辅助劳动力。这些缺点必须坚决消灭。
    添置最新式的机器、消除“薄弱”环节、改进生产组织，并且广泛地推广先进工厂和生产革新者的方法，我们就能够为在目前的五年计划期间增加现有工厂的生产创造新的可能性。
    国家计划委员会估计，通过改进生产的组织工作和更有效地利用生产设备，有可能在1960年至少再多生产700万吨生铁、1，100万吨钢、7，000万吨煤、大约10万台拖拉机、1，000多万吨水泥、4，200万双鞋子和大量其他在国民经济中具有重要性的物品。
    为了要在新工厂里获得这种额外的产品数量，我们应当要建立10个或者10个以上的高炉和35个平炉、挖两百个煤坑、修建两个拖拉机工厂、17个水泥工厂和8个鞋厂。这种建设工作将需要几十亿卢布的费用。
    同志们！我国劳动人民对于技术的不断进步是有密切关系的，因为这是减轻劳动和提高劳动生产率以造福整个社会的一个可靠办法。
    技术进步并不只是科学家、工程师、技术人员和研究所及设计局的工作人员的事情。不，这是我们全体——党、政府和经济的组织、科学家、工程师、革新工作者和发明家——的任务。我们必须大家都一起努力来改进技术。
      党中央委员会和苏联部长会议认为，我们必须动员我们的全部力量来完成促进技术进步的重要任务。
    社会主义经济制度和现代科学成就为我们提供了发展技术的无穷潜力。在我们的伟大的党领导下的全体苏联人民，必须充分利用这些潜力，争取在技术进步方面取得领导的地位。我们能够做到这点而且必须做到这点。
    农业方面的任务
    第六个五年计划期间的主要目标之一是保证农业产品的大大增加。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在中央委员会的报告中透彻地分析了农业情况，并且详细地概述了我们的党在这方面规定的任务。
    这个报告详尽地叙述了中央委员会为了克服在集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场方面所犯的错误和缺点而通过的措施，以及为我们的社会主义农业取得大步前进创造必要条件的措施。党为了争取农业产品大大增加而拟定的计划将得到坚持不渝的实现。
    在第六个五年计划期间，农业总产量将增加大约70％，就是说增加的速度比第五个五年计划期间快得多。比较重要的农业部门的指标如下：
    谷物总产量在1960年要增加到110亿普特。
    计划在1960年把玉蜀黍播种面积至少扩大到2，800万公顷，并且组织大规模的玉蜀黍杂交种子的生产，因为这种种子可以大大提高单位面积产量。
    110亿普特谷物的收获将使我们能够满足对粮食的日益增长的需求，增加政府的储备，建立集体农庄的必要储存，扩大对友好国家的出口，并且为牲畜饲养储备足够的谷物。
    为工业原料作物——棉花、亚麻和甜菜规定了巨大的目标。亚麻的产量将增加三分之一以上，棉花的产量将增加一半以上。
    对扩大甜菜的生产必须给予特别的注意。单位面积产量必须提高，在种植甜菜的主要地区，这种作物的播种面积必须扩大，在条件有利于这种作物的种植的其他地区也必须扩大这种作物的播种面积。
    党中央委员会和政府最近通过了一个旨在促进马铃薯和蔬菜的产量提高的重要决议。根据这个决议，马铃薯的征购价格平均提高到将近三倍，收购价格提高70％。蔬菜的征购和收购价格平均提高70％。还规定了其他的措施，这些措施将使集体农庄和国营农场在扩大马铃薯和蔬菜的生产上获得利益。
    为了改进对城市居民的马铃薯、蔬菜和全奶的供应，计划扩大大城市和工业中心附近现有的牛奶场和蔬菜马铃薯区，并且建立新的牛奶场和蔬菜马铃薯区。
    在畜牧业方面，计划要急剧增加产量来充分满足居民对肉类、牛奶和其他畜产品的需要。
    肉类的产量将增加一倍，这主要是通过扩大养猪业来达到。集体农庄和国营农场必须大规模组织猪的饲养和肥育。此外，应该广泛利用增加牛羊肉的产量的现有的可能性。
    牛奶的产量将增加将近一倍，这主要是依靠大大提高每头奶牛的挤奶量和增加奶牛的繁殖率。
    在过去两年中，沃罗涅日、特尔诺波尔、车里雅宾斯克、库尔斯克和其他州的集体农庄每头奶牛的挤奶量提高了600到900公斤，这表明，如果集体农庄下定决心提高产量的话，它们拥有多么巨大的迅速增加牛奶产量的潜力。
    羊毛的生产将增加80％以上，方法是在俄罗斯联邦和乌克兰的原有养羊区以及在西伯利亚东部、中亚细亚和南高加索进一步扩大细毛和半细毛羊的饲养。
    畜牧业迅速发展的根本条件是扩大饲料生产。目的是要充分保证各种家畜和家禽的饲料供应以及保证集体农民私有的牲畜的饲料供应。在集体农庄和国营农场建立保险饲料储备是非常重要的。
    建立稳定的饲料供应的最具有决定性的因素是玉蜀黍。大大增加玉蜀黍的产量，我们就将能够更好地为我们的牲畜供应浓缩饲料和青贮饲料和鲜饲料。在那些多年生草和一年生草的收成好的地区，必须扩大这些牧草的种植。
    指示草案规定国营农场的产品产量应该有进一步的巨大增加。在1960年，国营农场必须向国家缴纳91，500万普特谷物、150万吨肉类、680万吨奶类以及大约8万吨羊毛。
    所有的国营农场必须最合理地使用它们的土地，必须急剧减少在生产中的物资和劳动的消耗，而成为收入很高的企业。
    在第六个五年计划期间，农业将越来越多地得到数量很大的各种更加新式的机器。
    计划向农业供应大约165万台拖拉机（每台以15匹马力计算），其中包括68万台中耕拖拉机；56万台谷物收获联合机，25万台玉蜀黍收获联合机和青贮饲料收获联合机以及其他许多机器。
    向农业供应进行大规模的分段收获的机器的问题是在收获期间同谷物损失进行的斗争中的一个极其重要的因素，应该予以特别的注意。
    指示草案规定，在五年期间，将供给农业18万台拖拉机牵引的简易收割机，40万架收获联合机附属的捡拾机，但是显然这个数目是不会够的。
    政府日前讨论了这个问题，它指示国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会以及农业部、国营农场部、拖拉机和农业机器制造部对这个问题作进一步的刻苦的研究，以便更充分地确定农业究竟需要多少分段收割粮食用的机器。
    这是一个非常重要的面向未来的任务。必须做一切必要的工作来实现这个任务。
    计划中规定的各种农业机器的大量供应，将是我们的工业对农业的巨大帮助。我们知道，我们是在1929年开始比较大量地供给农业以拖拉机的。根据第一、第二、第三和第四个五年计划，我们供应了1，375，000台拖拉机。现在单在第六个五年时期，政府计划供给农业的拖拉机就要比头四个五年计划时期的总和多275，000台。
    我们的工业是在1931年开始供给农业以谷物收获联合机的，从那时到1955年（1955年也包括在内），它拿出了505，000台。现在单在第六个五年期间，所供给的谷物收获联合机就要比以前25年中供给的总和多55，000台。
    但是问题还不仅仅在于数量。我们将在我们的农场上使用工作起来最经济的柴油拖拉机，有气轮胎的拖拉机，最新式的收获联合机，由拖拉机手直接操纵的吊挂式农具，和用来准备饲料、使畜牧业中的费力操作过程机械化等等的大量最新式机器。
    这一切将把农业提高到一个新的更高的技术水平，并且将使得提高农业的各个部门的效率成为可能。
    在谈到使农业的技术装备完善的时候，我们必须包括应用电气使许多种类的工作、特别是畜牧业方面的工作机械化这样一个重要问题。必须承认，我们在农村电气化方面是做得不够的。
    农业部应当对这种情况负相当大的责任，它没有坚持不懈地提出这个问题。此外，指定供发展农村电气化之用的经费往往用于其他目的。
    实行农业电气化的方法是，把集体农庄和国营农场同国家电力站连结起来，或者在集体农庄参加的情况下建设地方的发电厂。
    指示草案规定，电气化的集体农庄将增加一倍，国营农场和机器拖拉机站将完全电气化。因此，工业必须扩大经济而又可靠的用电力发动的农业机器的生产。
    在第六个五年计划期中，农业的最重要的任务之一就是增加各种作物的每公顷产量。这一点将大大有赖于矿物肥料的应用。它们的供应量将至少增加一倍。应该大规模组织用作肥料的泥煤和石灰的工业生产。
    农业的目标还要求进一步改进机器拖拉机站的工作和扩大它们在集体农庄生产中的作用，同时还要求在组织上和经济上加强集体农庄和提高集体农民的劳动生产率。
    党中央委员会和政府已经执行了若干措施来改进机器拖拉机站的工作和扩大它们在发展集体农庄生产中的作用。
    最近中央委员会和苏联部长会议通过了决定，规定由机器拖拉机站完全承担在集体农庄进行采购的任务。
    机器拖拉机站的逐渐过渡到经济核算制，将是进一步改进机器拖拉机站工作的重要因素，因为经济核算制将增加机器拖拉机站人员对于他们在集体农庄所进行的工作的责任感，增加机器拖拉机站对于集体农庄生产成果的物质兴趣。
    同志们，为了保证大大增加农业产量，必须广泛全面地吸取先进集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的经验。它们表明应该如何在实际上大大提高农业生产。
    广大的集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场工作者和其他农业专业人员，都把党所规定的大大增加农业产量的目标看作是它们自己的切身事业，并且正在设法提前完成新的五年计划的指标。
    在这方面，应该给沃罗涅日州的集体农民和其他农业工作者的宝贵倡议以各种鼓励。他们在估计了资源和潜力以后，已经保证在一年中把肉类产量增加一倍，在18个月中把牛奶产量增加一倍。
    沃罗涅日州的人民的爱国倡议正在得到各地的热烈支持。基里钦科、帕托利切夫、布列日涅夫、卡皮托诺夫、苏斯洛夫、伊格纳捷夫各位同志和其他代表们在这里的发言中都向代表大会保证，乌克兰、白俄罗斯、哈萨克、巴什基尔自治共和国、拉克斯诺达边疆区以及莫斯科州和其他州都能够比指示草案所规定的时间更早地完成第六个五年计划的农业生产目标。
    我国人民将非常满意地欢迎从第二十次党代表大会的崇高的讲台上所作的这些保证。希望所有的共和国、边疆区和州在实现它们的保证方面取得成就。
    没有疑问，在党和政府机关的指导和积极帮助下，正在开展社会主义竞赛的我国的农民，将胜利地完成并且超过第六个五年计划的指标。
    运输和交通方面的任务
    由于在第六个五年计划期间国民经济有很大的扩展，货物运输量将大大增加。
    货物载运方面的主要任务将像以往一样由铁路担负。单是铁路货运增加的数量就将超过4，000亿吨公里，约等于1940年我国铁路的总运货量。
    为了适应这样大量的货运，铁路的输送能力将必须大大提高。因此，在铁路运输方面的基本任务就是进一步改善它的技术设备。
    铁路运输方面的技术进步的主要趋势是改用电气和柴油机的牵引装备，广泛采用运输的自动和集中管理以及改善线路设备。
    根据党中央委员会通过的一项实现铁路电气化的15年总计划，打算把重要货运线、山区线、客运频繁的干线以及大工业中心的郊区线改用电气机车牵引。
    这个铁路技术改建计划的第一阶段将在第六个五年期间完成。
    计划使8，100公里铁路线电气化，即等于第五个五年期间电气化的长度的三点六倍。一条有全国重要意义的铁路干线，即莫斯科—古比雪夫—车里雅宾斯克—鄂木斯克—新西伯利亚—伊尔库次克线的电气化将要完成。莫斯科—哈尔科夫—顿巴斯线和其他铁路线也将转变到由电气机车牵引。将要大规模采用内燃机车。在五年中，使用内燃机车的铁路线的长度将从7，000公里增加到25，000公里。
    牵引工作的技术改造应该使得有可能在1960年使全部货运量的40％到45％由电气机车和内燃机车牵引，而在1955年这个数字是14％。
    铁路必须做的重要事情之一是改善它们的线路设备。指示草案规定在现有的铁路网中铺设65，000公里新铁轨，其中包括58，000公里的重轨，同时也规定广泛采用钢筋混凝土轨枕。这意味着将有将近一半的干线铺设比较重的新铁轨，这将大大增加它们的运输能力，减少在线路护养和修理方面消耗的劳动，并且大大减少经营费。
    计划在五年内供应铁路至少2，000台电气机车、2，250台两组内燃机车、255，000个货车厢和18，600个客车厢。
    指示草案规定进一步扩大铁路网。打算铺设和使用大约6，500公里的新线通车，比第五个五年计划期间铺设的铁路增加一倍。将使以下的重要铁路线通车：马格尼托哥尔斯克—斯捷利塔马克—阿布杜林诺线（这条线是从南西伯利亚干线到国家的欧洲部分的直接通路，它绕过运输非常繁忙的车里雅宾斯克—乌法线）；斯大林斯克—阿巴根线（它是南西伯利亚干线的重要部分，目的是要把矿砂运到库兹涅茨克钢铁工厂，把托穆辛斯克矿区的煤运出去）；巴尔瑙尔—鄂木斯克线（它是一条从库兹巴斯到乌拉尔的新通路，绕过运输过忙的新西伯利亚—鄂木斯克线）；古里耶夫—阿斯特拉罕线（它是一条联结奥伦堡线和奥尔忠尼启则线的铁路线，这条线使乌拉尔到高加索的货运路线缩短500公里）。
    还计划修建一条从阿拉木图到苏联国境的铁路线，以便提供一个循最短路线同中国西部地区建立的新联系，这将是联结我国同中华人民共和国的第三条铁路线。
    除了铺设新的铁路以外，还将铺设复线约6，600公里，即比第五个五年计划时期多40％。
    海运方面。在五年期间，海运货运量将增加一倍以上。同中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家、印度共和国、缅甸联邦和其他国家发展贸易的结果，苏联船只载运的出口和进口货物的数量将要增加。我们的黑海区域、远东区域和其他区域之间和经由北海航路的货运量将大大增加。
    我们的科学家在原子能方面的成就使我们的海员和北极探险家得到了征服严酷的北极的新的武器。在第六个五年计划时期，我们将建造一艘强有力的原子破冰船，这艘船将使北极的航行季节能够延长，使我们的船只能够越过厚冰的障碍。
    我们的海船队将得到大量的新的和最新式的船只。在五年期间，它将得到总吨数达160万吨的货船，即比第五个五年计划时期多80％。我们将建造新的大型油船、木材运输船、内燃机船和其他船舶。因此我们必须更加注意发展我们的造船工业。
    指示草案规定改善海港的技术设备和提高它们的吞吐能力。
    河运方面。计划在这五年内把河运货运量增加80％。我们的河运工作者必须大大增加谷物、木材、石油、煤和其他大宗货物的运输量。他们的重要任务是在伏尔加河、卡马河、第聂伯河和其河流上由于水电站的建筑而出现的新的深水航线上通航。
    在第六个五年计划期间，河运部必须把它的港口和码头设备提高到适当的水平和保证发展港口和码头，首先是发展伏尔加河、卡马河和西伯利亚各河流的港口和码头。
    河运部将得到总能力达90万匹马力的机动货船、拖船和客船和总载重量达200万吨以上的非机动船。鉴于我国共有50万公里的适于航行和漂运木材的水路，河流运输必须大大扩充并且必须成为最便宜的运输方式。
    公路运输将进一步地发展。在五年计划期间，公路运输的货运量将增加约100％，客运量将增加200％以上。
    在1960年，汽车工业将生产65万辆卡车、轿车和公共汽车，拖车的生产将增加数倍。打算用效能更大的汽车、公共汽车和发动机来代替旧式的汽车，公共汽车和发动机。
    第六个五年计划计划扩大硬路面的公路的建筑和改建。我们必须建筑更多的比柏油混凝土公路更为坚固耐用的水泥混凝土公路。
    空运的目标是增加货运量100％，增加客运量约280％，供给航空公司以更大的和更快的最新式的客机。
    通讯方面。指示草案规定要在最新的技术成就的基础上大大扩充和改建通讯设备。举一个例子说，我们计划在五年中建立至少达1万公里的无线电中继通讯线路，有了这种线路，就可以同时在一个方向内进行多达1，200次的电话谈话，而且还可以进行长距离电视广播。
    在第六个五年计划期间，自动电话站的通话量将增加到约为前一个五年计划的两倍。还计划增加邮局的数目和扩大农村地区的电话和无线电设备。
    基本建设方面的任务
    关于我们前几个五年计划期间的基本投资的下列材料（按1955年7月1日的价格计算），将使你们能够判断第六个五年计划的基本建设的规模。
    第一个五年计划时期的国家基本投资达到580亿卢布，第二个五年计划的数字是1，325亿卢布，第三个五年计划的3年半的数字是1，310亿卢布，第四个五年计划是3，110亿卢布，第五个五年计划是5，940亿卢布。
    现在第六个五年计划规定了9，900亿卢布的投资。
    从这些数字将可以看出，现在这个五年计划的基本投资数量超过了第四第五两个五年计划基本投资的总和。
    用作整个国民经济的基本投资的9，900亿卢布当中，6，000亿卢布以上将用于工业方面；这个数字比第五个五年计划时期增加70％。
    这项基本投资的大部分将用于建设生产电力、化学工业品、黑色金属和有色金属、石油和煤、建筑材料和木材的新企业，在这些工业方面的投资将超过4，000亿卢布。
    轻工业和食品工业将得到比前一个五年计划多75％的投资，运输和交通将得到比前一个五年计划多70％的投资。
    农业投资将增加1，200亿卢布，即比第五个五年计划的数字增加近一倍。此外，集体农庄将从它们自己的经费中投资大约1，000亿卢布。
    建设房屋、公用事业机构、学校、医院、儿童福利机构、电影院、戏院的拨款将大大增加。在这方面将总共用2，000亿卢布，而在第五个五年计划时期是1，200亿卢布。
    用来添置新的更高效率的装备的拨款增加了。虽然基本投资总的来说是增加67％，但是为新机器和装备的拨款将增加80％。
    近年来，建筑工业已经有了牢固的技术基础，并且得到了先进的机器和装备。这个工业已有了更多的熟练工人、工程师和技术员。目前，全部建设工作有80％以上是由专门建筑组织承包的。
    第六个五年计划规定进行一个规模巨大的工业建设计划。例如，将有比所有以前的各个五年计划时期合起来还要大得多的发电能力投入生产。在煤炭工业方面，计划规定兴建新的矿井和露天矿场，它们总的生产能力为24，000万吨，这比第四和第五个五年计划合起来的数字还要多得多。
    在使用新的生产设备方面规定了很大的目标。在这方面应该指出，许多部和建筑机构在第五个五年计划时期没有按时履行把新生产能力投入生产的时间表。这种情况必须制止，在目前的五年时期内，严格按照时间表把新的设备投入生产必须成为每一个部，每一个中央管理局和每一个企业的法律。为了要做到这一点，必须更有效得多地把大量物质和财政资源用于基本建设。
    在前五年期间，建筑工业没有能完成它的减低成本的任务。许多建筑机构年年都在亏本的情况下进行工作，并且支出一些非生产开支。
    我们在第六个五年计划时期的目标是，通过改进组织工作、提高劳动生产率和减少杂费的办法把建筑安装工作成本至少减低7％，从而节约大约300亿卢布。
    我们的一些建筑专家最近访问了美国、英国、法国、意大利、瑞典和其他国家，他们在那里看到了许多新鲜有趣的事情。
    我们的建筑工作者应当利用其他国家建筑机构的最好的经验。
    苏共中央委员会和苏联部长会议十分重视建筑工业，它们作出了一系列的决议，提出了一个改进建筑工作的全面计划。
    它们也采取了重大的组织措施。成立了五个新的建设工业部：电站建设部、石油工业建设部、采煤工业企业建设部、运输建设部、城市和乡村建设部。建造部以及冶金工业和化学工业企业建造部已经改组成为联盟兼共和国的部。
    莫斯科、列宁格勒和基辅的建筑工业机构，已经合并成为莫斯科建设总管理局、列宁格勒建设总管理局和基辅建设总管理局这样一些较大的地区单位。
    由于这种合并，管理人员和职员大大减少了，同时工业化建筑方法更加广泛地使用了。在合并以前，莫斯科、列宁格勒和基辅的建筑工业机构经常不能完成自己的年度计划；现在它们的计划完成得很好。它们超额完成了去年的提高劳动生产率的任务，并且使建筑费用比概算减少了7，000万卢布。
    在顿河上的罗斯托夫、阿穆尔河上的共青团城和其他一些城市所进行的类似的合并，也产生了良好的成果。
    尽管扩大建筑工业机构有着明显的好处，合并工作却进行得非常缓慢。目前仍然存在着大量小的建筑工业机构，相互重复，分属于不同的部和不同的主管机关，它们的工作没有赢利。例如，在斯维德洛夫斯克就有74个建筑工业机构，在新西伯利亚就有84个。
    既然显而易见扩大建筑机构是适宜的，那末，为什么合并进展得这样慢呢？
    严重的障碍是许多部和主管机关采取了错误的、纯粹本位主义的态度，它们对待整个问题的态度是一种心地狭窄的私人企业家的态度。应该说，国家建设委员会在把建筑机构联合成较大的单位这个问题上也没有表现出应有的坚持精神。
    我们必须狠狠地打击这些落后的倾向，打击那些妨碍着这样一件重要的国家事业的官僚主义者。
    基本建设方面的主要任务是大大缩短建筑时间，防止把经费分散在许多工程项目上，反对设计和建筑方面的铺张浪费，继续通过广泛使用工厂和工地建筑材料场生产的钢筋混凝土构件来使建筑工作工业化，尽量实行全面机械化施工。
    应该增加建筑机构的技术设备，特别是在东部地区；应该组织制造建筑材料和构件的区的企业；应该更加坚决地进行进一步合并建筑机构的工作，改善对建筑工作的领导质量，加强国家纪律。
    建筑工作人员必须改善建筑工作的质量，特别是在住宅、市政建设和文化建设工程方面的质量；必须降低建筑成本和使建筑机构有赢利；必须充分利用现有的一切机器，改进对工地的材料和技术设备的供应。设计、研究和建筑机构对于采用科学和技术成就的作用和责任必须增加。
    我已经说明了第六个五年计划中关于工业、农业、运输、邮电和基本建设的主要任务。
    它们的规模是空前的，它们的完成将使我国整个国民经济大大前进，将增加我国的物质、粮食和财政的资源，进一步加强我们伟大祖国的经济力量。
    （三）提高劳动生产率和改善管理
    党的加速技术进步的政策将表现在劳动生产率的巨大增长上，因为只有在这个基础上，才能保证社会主义生产继续不断地迅速扩大。
    我国人民同他们劳动生产率的增长是有切身的利害关系的。劳动生产率的提高是提高职工的实际工资，提高集体农民的收入和改善全体人民的生活水准的坚实基础。
    自从战争结束以来，工业方面的劳动生产率几乎已经增加到二点三倍，在建筑和铁路方面增加到两倍。但是，在第五个五年计划中，第十九次党代表大会的指示提出的劳动生产率的目标却没有完全达到。
    在工业方面，劳动生产率提高了44％，而指标是50％；在建筑业方面，数字分别是45％和55％。农业同样也没有达到劳动生产率指标。
    在第六个五年计划期间，我们必须完成更迅速地提高劳动生产率的任务。
    指示草案规定工业生产率至少提高50％，建筑业至少提高52％，并且规定农业和运输业的生产率要有很大的提高。
    根据第六个五年计划，提高劳动生产率的办法主要将是在工业、农业、运输业、建筑业以及其他经济部门广泛使用现代化的新机器，以便在这个基础上提高劳动的技术装备。我只需要说，产业工人的电气装备，在五年内就将增加60％以上。
    整顿生产定额和工资率将会大大有助于提高劳动生产率。
    事实上，能认为这样的情况是正常的吗：甚至在劳动组织方面存在很大缺点，工作时间有相当大的浪费的情况下，我们的机械工厂中还有许多完成产量定额180％、200％或者还要多，而同时劳动生产率指标却常常完成不了。以哈尔科夫工作母机工厂为例：在1955年，产量定额平均的完成情况是190％，而劳动生产率计划却只完成了86％。
    不用说，这样的超额完成定额同革新者和先进生产工作者的成就是不相干的，对于革新者和先进生产工作者来说，在大大超额完成定额的同时，劳动生产率也必需相应地提高。
    采用这种定得很低的生产定额，并且大大地超额完成它，会造成一种令人感觉一切都很好的错觉，并且会使工人、工长和工程师不去注意真正切实地提高生产率。目前生产定额实际上不是决定于已经达到的技术水平和劳动组织水平，而是决定于要使定额适应已定工资水平的愿望。
    不能认为这种情况是正常的：基本工资在一个工人的全部收入中的比重不超过40％到60％，许多工厂比这还要低。必须毫不迟延地整顿工业中的工资制度，并且为大规模推行根据技术决定的生产定额扫清道路。
    在这样作的同时，我们应该消除在同一种行业，而且往往在同一地区中工人工资相差很大的情况。
    工资制度必须足以为提高生产率和提高技术提供物质的鼓励。这种制度的规定必须使每一个工人按照自己劳动的质量和数量领取工资。
    还必须大大改进工程师、技术员和经济管理人员的现有的工资和奖金制度。正像尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在中央委员会的报告中所指出的，我们要做到使这一类人员所得到的报酬的一部分必须严格地取决于各该车间、工厂或者工业的基本生产指数。
    因此，同志们，我们面对着一个非常重要和迫切的任务：整顿工人、职员和工程技术人员的劳动定额和工资制度。
    各部和各主管机关的领导人和国家劳动和工资问题委员会应该更积极地努力来执行中央委员会七月全体会议关于这些问题的决议。
    执行我们的国民经济发展计划的一个最重要的条件是完成降低产品成本和流通费用的任务。
    指示草案规定工业生产成本、铁路运转费用、国营和合作贸易的流通费用至少降低17％。把国民经济各部门都计算在内，五年里这笔钱的总数应该是大约5，000亿卢布，即为第六个五年计划中基本投资总额的一半以上。因此，完成降低产品成本和流通费用的任务是非常重要的国民经济任务。
    为了充分利用现有的降低产品成本的可能性，为了把它们变成有效的积累来源，党和经济组织必须特别注意改进企业管理的每一方面、每一个企业都实行严格的节约、更有效的经济核算制，特别注意根除所有官僚主义的现象、不能胜任的管理以及劳动力和物质资源的浪费，特别注意保证更好地利用装备、原料、材料、燃料和电力，并且特别注意促进更广泛地使用金属、皮革、天然纤维和食品工业原料的代用品。
    我们的党对企业的所有领导人员的主要要求是：他们随时随地从社会主义社会的利益出发，不懈地努力争取完成国家计划，以他们全部活动对提高生产、增进我们的人民的繁荣作出贡献。
    （四）提高物质和文化水平
    同志们，对人民福利的经常关怀是我们党的活动的最高准则。我们国家正在实行的发展经济和文化的伟大计划的目的，就是不断增进苏联人民的福利、继续提高全体苏联人民的文化水平和更充分地满足他们的物质和精神需要。
    在第六个五年计划时期，这个崇高的目标也摆在我们面前。进一步大大提高苏联人民的物质福利、扩大房屋建筑和提高文化、教育和卫生水平是新的五年计划的主要目标之一。
    我们知道，一个国家的经济发展和它的社会财富增长来源的最一般的指标是它的国民收入。在社会主义制度下，全部国民收入是名副其实的人民的收入。第六个五年计划规定苏联的国民收入增加大约60％。
    在国民收入增加的基础上，居民的个人收入也将随着增加。在第六个五年时期内，职工的实际工资将增加大约30％。集体农民的现金收入和实物收入增加的数量将不少于40％，这首先是从增加公有的集体农庄经济按劳动日的分配的收入得来的。
    在共产党领导下的苏联人民，在最近几年中以忘我的工作已经无可估量地加强了国家的经济力量和增加了国家的社会财富。正如你们大家知道的，这样使得党中央委员会能够向这次代表大会提出进一步提高人民生活水平和改善他们工作条件的极其重要的措施。这些措施是：
    提高收入低的工作人员的工资，同时进行一次职工工资的普遍调整。
    从1957年开始的五年内过渡到7小时工作制，或者是在某些部门过渡到8小时工作制但是每星期工作5天、休息两天。
    从1956年开始，星期6和节日前一天的工作日减少两小时；恢复16岁到18岁的少年6小时工作日。
    彻底改善养老金制度、大大提高低额养老金的金额、对残废和年老人予以更多的照顾。
    改善妇女的工作和生活条件；特别是延长工资照发的产假。
    从新学年开始，高等学校、专科学校和十年制学校高级班一律免收学费。
    中央委员会的这一切建议都得到我国人民的热烈支持，毫无疑问，第二十次代表大会将一致通过把这些建议列入关于第六个五年计划的指示中，作为党和政府坚持不懈地关怀改善苏联人民生活水平的新的生动的证明。
    党中央委员会和苏联政府确信：我国人民将以更大的劳动积极性来回答这种关怀，他们将尽自己的最大力量来完成和超额完成第六个五年计划的任务。
    同志们，随着工人、集体农民和知识分子收入的增加，必须扩大商业，必须扩大国营和合作社的商业机构所出售的货品的数量。
    在五年期间，零售贸易总额应增加50％。可是，任务不仅在于扩大贸易，而且还在于从质量上改进贸易。
    因此，指示草案就规定以更高的速度来增加像奶油、肉类、牛奶、乳酪和食糖以及毛织品、亚麻织品、鞋靴和家具等这样一些货物的销售额。无线电收音机、电视机、家用电气冰箱、除尘器、洗涤机和汽车等文化和生活必需品的销售量也要增加。商业机构必须更好地研究消费者的要求，保证正确地分配，保证及时地把商品运送到商店。我们的商业机构必须这样进行工作：使全国各地都能买到所需要的货品。
    第六个五年计划规定迅速发展公共饮食业，增加食堂和餐厅。我们的目的是不但供应工作的人伙食，而且供应他们的家属伙食，这样可以减轻家庭妇女的劳动。将要增设学校食堂和食品小卖部。
    第六个五年计划在房屋建筑方面提出了异常巨大的任务。
    我们知道，无论在战前和战后，国家房屋建筑的规模一直是很大的。但是，像我上面所指出的，住房的需要仍然是很迫切的，改善人民居住条件是党和政府特别关怀的一个问题。
    在第六个五年计划期间，仅仅用政府的拨款，将建筑20，500万平方公尺的新房屋。这比上一个五年计划的数字增加将近一倍。
    国家将鼓励而且从各方面帮助劳动人民用自己的储蓄和靠政府贷款的帮助来建筑住宅。我们应当扩大在农村地区的房屋建筑。集体农庄应当更积极地帮助自己的庄员用他们的储蓄建筑住宅，如果需要的话，集体农庄就贷款给庄员建筑住宅。我们打算大大扩大售给集体农庄和居民的建筑材料：例如水泥、木材、金属、玻璃、石板、墙壁材料等。
    庞大的住宅建造计划要求迅速增加家具的制造，并且改进家具的质量。
    目前家具的供应是不充分的，家具制造工业不能令人满意地适应日益增长的需要。因此，必须不再延迟地按照消费者的喜好组织大量生产价廉而适用美观的家具。成套家具的制造也应该增加。
    除此以外，我们也必须规定：今后在设计和建设住宅时需要在室内装设良好的适用的室内固定家具，在这一方面，我们必须吸取外国现有的优良经验。
    我们的文化发展中的重要任务之一，是国民教育的进一步发展。
    七年制学校制度已经普遍施行。在第五个五年计划期间我们已经开始施行城市和乡村的普及中等教育，在第六个五年计划期间我们希望基本上完成这一工作。
    除了普及中等教育学校和中等专科学校以外，也应该进一步扩展函授学校和夜校，使人民不脱离生产而得到普及教育和提高文化水平。
    在今后五年内，我们的中等学校十年级毕业生将有630万人，相当于过去五年中毕业人数的两倍以上。
    我们的国民教育当局所面临的首要任务就是尽量发展学校里的综合技术教育。过去五年时期中，我们在这方面所做的工作只是一个开端，必须承认，学校里的综合技术教育仍然是不能令人满意的。许多学校不把劳动技能教给学生，也不培养他们对劳动应有的尊重。其结果就是，许多从中学毕业的男女青年都不适于进行实际的活动。
    必须大力加强普及教育学校的教学物质基础。在第六个五年计划期间，我们准备用国家资金在城市和乡村地区修建可以容纳差不多400万名学生的新学校建筑，即比第五个五年计划增加一倍。必须更广泛地吸引集体农庄参加修建和装备农村学校的工作。
    普及中等教育是全国所关心的一个问题。而这项非常重要的工作的主要人物就是学校教师。我们的普及教育学校里有170多万名教师。教师职业在我国是最受人尊敬的职业之一，因为他们的任务是教育未来的共产主义社会的建设者。党、政府、经济组织和共青团组织必须经常关心学校和教师。
    第六个五年计划规定了培养国民经济专门人才的巨大任务。
    现在，我国有550多万专门人才。我们因为他们而感到自豪，因为他们是我们的极其宝贵的财产，我们非常珍视他们。资本主义代言人们对于他们国家在培养专门人才方面落在我们后面表示惊慌，这不是没有理由的。
    在第六个五年计划时期，我们的高等学校和中等专业学校所培养出的专门人才的数目将有显著的增加。这五年的总数定为400万，差不多等于前两个五年时期的数字的总和。
    工业、建筑、运输和农业部门将得到65万多受过高等教育的专门人才，也就是前一个五年的两倍。
    现在正在对培养自动力学、遥控机械学、无线电学、无线电定位学和和平利用原子能等新的科学和技术部门的专家，给予严重的注意。
    高等学校和中等专业学校所举办的函授学校和夜校在新的五年计划中将广泛地发展。随着参加工业的中学毕业生的人数日益增加，将有充分的机会吸收那些受过很好的普通教育并且具有实际生产经验的青年人进入这种学校学习。
    经济和文化建设的任务要求认真地改进专门人才的培养工作；他们必须通晓苏联和外国的科学技术的最新成就。需要把理论学习和生产的实习——包括它的经济及组织方面——更为密切地结合起来。
    指示草案中所规定的发展电影院、报章杂志、无线电台、电视以及改进图书馆、俱乐部和其他文化机构的工作的措施，是提高我国人民文化水平的一个最重要的因素。
    我们计划改进和进一步扩充出版事业——印行更多的书籍、杂志和报纸。
    在第六个五年计划时期，在公共卫生方面，应当解决许多巨大的任务。
    指示草案规定大规模建设医疗机关。在第六个五年计划期间建立的医院和儿童福利机构的数目，将分别达前一个五年时期的三倍左右和二点四倍。幼儿园和托儿所能照顾的儿童将增加将近45％。这将有助于进一步改善妇女的劳动和生活条件，并且使她们能够更积极地参加生产以及文化、政治和其他社会活动。
    应该改进工业中的安全措施和预防疾病的措施，采取更加有效的措施防止水源和空气的污浊。应该提高城市和农村的卫生水平。
    我们的医学面临着重大的任务，人民希望医学上能有新的发现。
    保健工作人员、医学研究机构和医药工业应该加强他们在发明和广泛采用新的治疗药剂、预防药剂和经过改良的设备方面的工作。
    公共卫生当局为改善对居民的服务所采取的步骤，永远会得到党中央委员会和政府的支持和帮助。
    体育运动在提高国民健康水平方面同样是重要的因素，我们应该用一切办法鼓励体育和运动的发展，特别要注意改进青年中间的体育工作。
    我们党将采取一切必要的措施，以实现第六个五年计划期间关于进一步提高苏维埃人民的物质和文化水平的广泛的计划。
    （五）各加盟共和国的经济发展和生产力的地理分布
    同志们，国家的国民经济的新的强大高涨和生产力的正确的地理分布有不可分的联系。
    第十九次党代表大会的指示规定新的工业企业的更为合理的地理分布，其目的是使工业接近原料和燃料来源。国家的生产力的更为合理的分布的需要，曾经再度为党中央委员会在去年7月的全体会议上所强调。
    我们的工业化政策的胜利和东部地区的广大原料、燃料和动力资源的发展，使得有可能早在战前就在那里建立一个新的煤和金属基地、大规模的机器制造业、制铝和化学工业，和建筑铁路干线。这保证了生产力分布的彻底改进。在伟大的卫国战争中，我们的东部的工业，特别是乌拉尔和西伯利亚的工业，是苏联军队的一个重要的供应来源，而且在第四个五年计划中，在重建遭受战争破坏的地区方面具有无法估计的价值。
    在上一个五年计划期间，生产力的合理分布方面有了进一步的进展。
    根据新的计划，党将坚决地采取措施来进一步改进全国生产力的分布和整体地发展各个经济区域的经济。
    同我们以前几个五年计划一样，这一个五年计划也规定要用最快的速度开发拥有巨大的煤、铁矾土、水力、木材、铁矿、有色金属和稀有金属和化学原料资源的东部地区。
    必须使我国东部地区的大量的富源在比从前更大的程度上为国民经济服务。根据第六个五年计划，在东部地区的基本投资总额将增加一倍以上，约占全苏联基本投资总额的一半。
    到1960年，东部地区出产的煤和生铁要比1950年全苏联生产的还要多，生产电力和水泥比1954年全苏联生产的还要多得多。在这五年当中，将在东部建立100多个机器制造厂。
    要进一步发展东部地区的谷物生产。到第六个五年计划结束的时候，乌拉尔、西伯利亚和哈萨克的谷物总产量应该比这些地区产量达到最高纪录的1954年的产量增加一倍。
    你们从尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中已经知道党中央委员会和政府特别重视进一步发展西伯利亚的经济。
    俄国的一些杰出人物都曾经指出，西伯利亚有着无穷的富源和灿烂的未来。洛蒙诺索夫说：“增加俄国力量的将是西伯利亚”；拉地晓夫写道：“西伯利亚的富裕是得天独厚的！它是力量多么伟大的地方啊！……一旦那里有人居住，它就将在世界的历史上起伟大的作用。”
    我们的伟大的先人的理想正在变成事实。在苏维埃政权建立后的年代里，西伯利亚已经从一个落后的农业地区发展成为苏联的主要工业—农业地区之一。
    在第六个五年计划期间，这个十分富饶的地区将有进一步的全面发展。
    党所实行的全国生产力的分布方面的政策，是以全力发展和加强各加盟共和国的经济和文化为目的的。
    争取各加盟共和国在经济、政治和文化上的继续进展的一切条件都已经具备了。中央委员会的报告所列举出来的材料清楚地说明了各加盟共和国的经济和文化的发展。
    各加盟共和国在这一方面的成就的确是很大的。特别令人高兴的是：它们都已经训练出了掌握现代化技术的本民族的干部。
    党中央委员会和政府最近采取了一些重要的组织措施，来加强各加盟共和国在经济管理方面的作用。在加盟共和国中已经成立了新的联盟兼共和国部；本来属于全联盟的采煤、木材、石油、钢铁、肉类、奶类、轻工业、纺织、食品、建筑材料等许多工业企业以及汽车运输设备和通讯设备，都已移交给加盟共和国的各部了。
    在最近几年中，有11，000多个本来属于全联盟的工业企业已移交给各加盟共和国管理。
    在执行所有这些措施的时候，党中央委员会遵循着这个列宁主义原则：在解决经济和文化建设问题上，把集中的领导跟提高地方机构的独立性和发挥它们的主动性结合起来。
    由于许多工厂已经从联盟转归共和国管辖，在某些联盟兼共和国的部直接管辖下的企业已经所剩无几了。情况既是这样，那就显然不仅必须要考虑把中央机构大加精简的问题，同时也要考虑某些联盟兼共和国的部的继续存在一般说来是否适宜的问题。
    必须指出，为了防止在经济管理方面的过分集中所采取的措施遭到了全联盟的部和联盟兼共和国的部的某些领导人的反对，他们希望一切由中央来领导，好像他们“高高在上”就能够比各加盟共和国的领导更好地判断情况似的。
    目前党和政府为了提高各加盟共和国在领导经济和文化建设中的作用所采取的措施，是完全符合我们党所实行的列宁式的民族政策的原则的。
    成立一个作为自由、平等和主权国家的自愿的联合体的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的思想，完全属于我们的党和苏维埃国家的伟大的缔造者弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁。他提出了、论证了并且发展了这种思想。事实上，早在1922年的时候，列宁就曾警告要防止发生过度集中主义的可能性，防止发生那种可能阻碍加盟共和国的主动性的广泛和全面发展的官僚主义偏向。
    伟大的列宁的这种教导，现在对于我们仍然是极其重要的。
    我们今后应该继续坚定不移地执行这种加强加盟共和国在经济管理方面的领导作用的政策，并且更大胆地把全联盟管辖的工业企业移交给共和国管辖。
    这样将使我们对经济和文化的领导更加具体和灵活，并且会有助于进一步加强各共和国之间的兄弟合作。此外，党所采取的消除过度集中主义并且加强加盟共和国在经济管理方面的作用的措施，意味着建立国家机关同群众的更加密切的接触，并且还是发展和巩固我们的多民族的社会主义国家的又一个重要的步骤。
    我们在共和国里面组织领导企业的机关的时候，就像吉尔吉斯共产党中央委员会书记拉扎科夫同志在这里所指出的，当然不可盲目地模仿各联盟的形式。
    在加盟共和国中建立起只管辖少量的企业的联盟兼共和国的部的情形不仅是在吉尔吉斯才有。例如，塔吉克共和国建立了一个轻工业部，人员总共27人，并且只管理6个企业。土库曼共和国的纺织工业部管理10个企业。摩尔达维亚共和国设有林业部，人员共32人。它只管理8个企业，包括4个森林工业分局，其中的两个在俄罗斯联邦和乌克兰。
    各加盟共和国的部长会议和各联盟部必须仔细研究这个问题，消除机构过多的现象，并且作出决定，在各共和国分别设立这个或那个部是否适宜。我完全赞成尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的报告中所提出的建议：设立一个权威性的各共和国联合机构——苏联最高苏维埃民族院经济委员会——对有关各加盟共和国经济利益的问题作出考虑周到的决定，从而使各共和国的需要能得到更完善更充分的考虑。
    第六个五年计划指示草案规定各加盟共和国的经济要作有力的扩展，党中央委员会在制定第六个五年计划指示草案的时候，是从这一考虑出发的：指示应该只规定它们的工业和农业的基本任务。
    各加盟共和国的共产党中央委员会和它们的部长会议应当以大会的指示为基础，为目前这五年期间订出更加详细的经济和文化建设措施，并且拟出它们各自的五年发展计划。
    在第六个五年计划期间，我们各加盟共和国的经济和文化必须进一步繁荣起来。
    各加盟共和国的国民经济进一步发展的任务和改进全国生产力分布的任务完成后每一共和国的经济便能够提高到更高的水平，多民族的苏维埃国家的力量便能够得到进一步的加强，苏联各民族之间的友谊和兄弟般的合作便能够得到巩固。
    同志们！胜利完成第六个五年计划有赖于人民——有赖于工人、集体农民和知识分子，有赖于他们的忘我的劳动。在制定指示草案的时候，苏联共产党中央委员会考虑了好几万个工业企业和集体农庄的人们的建议。积极参加草拟和讨论五年计划的我们的城市和乡村的劳动人民的爱国主义首创性和各种各样的生产经验，帮助了党的中央委员会更全面地来制定经济各个部门在五年计划中的发展任务和发掘我们社会主义工业和农业中的巨大潜力。
    你们都知道，中央委员会所制定的指示草案在这次代表大会开会以前一个月就已经在我们的报纸上公布了。在这一个月中，这个指示草案在党的各代表大会和代表会议上、在党的积极分子会议上以及在工厂、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的会议上经过了热烈和认真的讨论。
    中央委员会、苏联部长会议、国家计划委员会和各家报纸接到了来自工人、集体农民、工程技术人员、教员、医生、学生、年老退休工人和苏军人员的关于第六个五年计划的各种各样问题的许许多多来信。
    在这些信中，有许多谈到了改善劳动组织和提高收入低的工人的工资的问题。还有许多关于改善劳动人民的文化和福利事业、养老金制度和医疗事业的建议以及关于使市、镇和工业区美化的建议。所有这一切建议的提出都是出于对社会主义国民经济、科学、文化和国民教育的关心。
    我国劳动人民一致赞同在第六个五年计划期间大力发展苏联经济的这个宏伟的计划，他们讨论了指示草案，发掘了国民经济中存在着的新的巨大潜力，揭发了并且正确地批评了缺点，并且建议了进一步改善我们的一切工作的方法。
    大家都知道，大会指示仅仅概括地提出了在今后五年期间发展苏联国民经济的基本任务。在这个指示的基础上，将制定发展苏联国民经济的五年计划，这项计划将给各部和主管机关规定详尽得多的计划中的每一年的指标。在拟订苏联全国的五年计划和各加盟共和国的五年计划的时候，应该考虑劳动人民、党组织、工厂、集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站提出的大量宝贵的建议。
    为迎接党第二十次代表大会而发起的全国范围的社会主义竞赛再一次表明：我国拥有多少有才干的人，并且先进经验的价值是多么大。
    所有党、政府、工会和共青团的组织的任务是要给予群众的这种创造积极性以一切帮助和鼓励，充分地发展和有效地引导在一切经济部门中展开的争取完成和超额完成第六个五年计划的任务的社会主义竞赛。我们一定要用胜任的领导、干部的正确挑选、对决议执行情况的有系统的检查——也就是说用我们党的整个组织工作来巩固和支持千百万工人、集体农民和知识分子的热情和创造性。
    在过去几个五年计划期间，共产党进行了卓越的领导，进行了卓越的组织工作。毫无疑问，现在党也将证明自己是能够胜任它的任务的。
    组织工作的目标应当首先是加强国家纪律，推广最新的科学和技术成就，广泛推广先进经验和提高劳动生产率。
    我们的经济和它的各个部门每年都在发展和改进。新的、愈来愈复杂的机器正在大规模地使用。因此，在目前情况下，为了能够有效地组织和指导生产，就必须具有专门的知识并且必须对一切细节进行深入的研究。只有具有这些条件的人才能进行具体和熟练的领导。
    任何一个负责人员如果不密切联系群众、依靠群众就无法顺利地工作。人们必须密切注意每一项批评意见，必须在发现缺点以后马上加以克服，必须积极地支持生产革新者、发明家和合理化建议者。
    苏维埃社会在精神上和政治上的团结，我国人民在共产党和苏维埃政府周围的磐石般的团结，工人阶级和集体农民的联盟的进一步加强，我国各族人民的兄弟般的友谊，这些是我们继续向着伟大的目标——共产主义社会——前进的保证。
    党为第六个五年计划规定的任务证明了苏维埃制度的伟大力量，这种制度为发展社会生产和提高人民的物质福利提供了无穷无尽的机会。
    关于第六个五年计划的指示草案表现了全体苏联公民的愿望和意志。他们从这个伟大的文件的每项任务中看到了党和政府对人民福利的不断的关怀。他们知道，这个新计划的实现将意味着在社会主义经济发展方面，在制造丰富的消费品方面又向前迈进一大步——在建设共产主义的伟大事业中向前迈进一大步。
    同志们，关于苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划不仅将对我们自己的国家具有极大的意义，而且在国际上也将同样具有极大的意义。我们党和苏维埃国家的伟大创始人弗·伊·列宁预言说：愈往后去，苏维埃国家，首先是它的经济政策，对世界历史进程、对人类历史命运的影响也将愈大。这个预见已经被证实了。
    苏联的经济和文化成就已经为苏联人民在世界各国赢得了千百万朋友。因为各国人民认为这些成就是苏联的和平意图的表现，是社会主义经济制度的巨大力量和优越性的证明，这种制度为发展生产力以促进劳动人民的利益提供了无穷的机会。
    至于资本主义国家中的某些分子，对他们来说，我们的每一个五年计划都是一件不愉快的然而又很现实的事实，是一件他们不得不考虑到的事实。不用怀疑，我们的几个五年计划已经使许许多多暴躁的人清醒过来，已经使许许多多资本主义世界的发言人的好战狂热冷了下来。
    每一个新的五年计划都加强了社会主义的地位和苏维埃国家的力量。因此，我们过去的几个五年计划不仅一直在愈来愈多的我们的朋友中间引起那样浓厚的兴趣，而且也一直在我们的敌人中间引起那样浓厚的兴趣，这是十分自然的。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案也引起了热烈的反应，但是这是同我们以前几个五年计划公布的时候所引起的反应不同的一种反应。你们中间许多人一定还记得资产阶级报纸和资本主义世界的政治家和经济专家们对以前几个五年计划说了些什么话。他们称呼这些计划是“幻想”，是“乌托邦”，是“宣传伎俩”；当时他们大叫大嚷说这些计划注定会遭到失败。的确，在这些计划胜利地实现以后，他们的语气也改变了：惊惶失措代替了嘲笑和暗淡的预言。而现在，当我们进入第六个五年计划时期的时候，即使对我们最直言无讳地怀有恶意的人也不敢怀疑我们的目标是否现实，也不敢预言我们的计划将会失败。他们甚至也说第六个五年计划将会完成，而且对这种前景感到非常惊慌。特别使资产阶级报纸和资本主义国家的某些集团感到苦恼的是，第六个五年计划意味着在实现苏联的基本经济任务方面向前迈进一大步。
    至于我们的朋友——伟大的中国人民和所有人民民主国家的劳动人民，他们一致兴奋地支持关于第六个五年计划的指示草案。这是可以理解的，因为这个五年计划的胜利完成，不仅将加强苏联，而且也将加强整个社会主义世界体系，并且将帮助所有人民民主国家在社会主义建设中取得新的巨大的胜利。
    看到我们的印度、缅甸和阿富汗朋友深切了解我们的经济目标的和平性质，是令人高兴的。
    苏联经济建设的宏伟计划是从我们的经济和社会制度的性质中产生的，是从我们的争取持久和平和一切国家和人民之间的友谊的思想中产生的。
    由于社会主义阵营各国一贯执行着和平政策，存在了若干年的国际紧张局势已经有了一定程度的缓和，而且出现了巩固世界和平的现实前景。
    我们为巩固和平而提出的建议并不总是在那些接到我们的建议的国家中间得到赞同的回答。我们对于这一点深感遗憾，但是我们还是满怀决心，不断地寻求走向国际合作的新的途径。我们将继续始终如一地和坚定不移地执行着列宁的和平共处的政策，深信这是走向大大加强国际信任和持久和平的唯一的道路。
    我们将进一步加强我们同各人民民主国家的兄弟友谊和合作以促进我们的共同利益。我们将继续为改善同美国、英国、法国和其他国家的关系而努力；我们将扩大和加强同印度共和国、缅甸、阿富汗和同一切希望维护和巩固和平的国家的友好合作；我们将通过最大限度地发展互利的贸易的办法来扩大同一切国家的经济关系。
    同志们，党中央委员会为第六个五年计划时期规定的任务是巨大的。要完成这些任务，需要全党和全体人民作出很大的努力和进行紧张的劳动。如果认为只要提出了任务和经过说明以后，其余的一切就会很容易地简单地自行解决，那就想错了。在实际生活中是没有这种情形的。在执行计划的时候会有不少的困难。但是，毫无疑问，我们能够克服这些困难，光荣地完成党所规定的全部任务。我们拥有做到这一点所必需的一切条件和可能。
    我们有一切必要的天然资源，而且数量是足够的。
    我们有我们的人民在前几个五年计划时期努力建立起来的强大的生产基础。
    我们拥有大量能够解决最复杂的科学技术问题的科学家和专家干部。
    我们的和平的建设性的劳动有我们勇敢的武装部队可靠地警卫着。
    我们的英雄的工人阶级和光荣的集体农民，我们的优秀的知识分子是由意志和目的的牢不可破的一致性团结在一起的，他们充满了创造性的能力并且深深相信他们的力量。
    苏联人民有着我们光荣的共产党这样一个久经考验的和英明的领导者，它是以伟大的、不朽的马克思列宁主义学说武装起来的，这种学说鼓舞着我们并且照亮了我们走向光辉灿烂的未来——共产主义——的道路。（经久不息的掌声，全体起立。）
