Tian Qifeng, a Zhuang farmer in Jingxi County, reaps a bumper harvest
To the Editor:
　　The Pingdan, Maba, Sanhe, and Pingmang townships in the ninth district of Jingxi County, Guangxi Province, are areas rich in Tianqi. Tianqi is a precious medicinal material, and its price is very high, about 100 yuan per kilogram. In the winter of 1955, Tianqi had another bumper harvest. In this mountainous area on the southern border of the motherland, the Zhuang farmers are happily busy harvesting the fruits of their year-long hard work.
　　The bumper harvest of Tianqi has greatly improved the lives of farmers in the mountainous areas. In the past two years, 29 households in Pingmo Village, Pingdan Township, have built 7 new houses, and have also added 10 horses, 10 mules, 4 threshing machines, and 1 sprayer. This year, poor farmer Liang Enguang sold 19.5 jin of Tianqi, earning more than 2,000 yuan. On one market day, he bought a horse, a cotton quilt, 2 mosquito nets, a felt rug, and 4 pairs of rubber shoes, and still had a lot of money left to deposit in the bank. He said gratefully: "How could we have had such good days under the Kuomintang!"
　　Indeed, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, farmers could not benefit from planting Tianqi. As Liang Yushan, chairman of the Pingdan Township Farmers Association, recalled: When the planted Tianqi was about to ripen, bandits would come to rob it; Pingmo Village was robbed twice in a row by bandits in 1947 and 1948. Fortunately, some Tianqi was harvested and taken to the market, but the landlords would depress the price to buy it, and the farmers would lose money after a year of hard work. Therefore, fewer and fewer people planted Tianqi. In the few years since liberation, the People's Government has vigorously supported the production of Tianqi. Banks have provided loans to farmers who grow Tianqi, and supply and marketing cooperatives have purchased Tianqi at reasonable and favorable prices. Therefore, the planting area of Tianqi has continued to expand, and bumper harvests have been achieved year after year, and the Zhuang people in the mountainous areas have enjoyed a prosperous life.
　　Now, after the bumper harvest, people immediately sow new seeds. In order to further promote the planting of Tianqi, the Jingxi County leading organs organized representatives of agricultural cooperatives throughout the county to visit the Tianqi production areas in November and December 1955, and invited Xu Tingming, a Tianqi planting expert and model worker of the special district, to introduce the benefits and planting experience of Tianqi. Each district and township is actively expanding or experimenting with the planting of Tianqi in accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions. Li Xueming

A new market town established in the Da Miao Mountains
To the Editor:
　　A market town has been established in Sanjiangmen, the Miao Autonomous Region of the Da Miao Mountains. This event made the people of all ethnic groups in the nearby villages and settlements feel extremely excited and happy. On November 25, 1955, the day the market was established, many Miao girls put on new festival costumes and went to Sanjiangmen in groups early in the morning. Five farming households from Shangluo Village in Dongtian Township even came in small boats the night before. The young people in the villages composed mountain songs to sing about the establishment of the new market town and their bright and happy tomorrow.
　　In the past, because there was no market town locally, farmers of all ethnic groups had to travel over mountains and ridges to places dozens or even more than 100 miles away to sell their local and special products. When buying and selling things, the exploitation by unscrupulous merchants was truly bone-chilling. The two sentences "Seven catties of honey, nine catties of skin" (meaning that selling seven catties of honey, but nine catties of "skin" were deducted by unscrupulous merchants) and "One egg, one needle" (meaning that selling one egg could only buy back one needle) are vivid descriptions of the suffering of all ethnic groups in the past when buying and selling things. The reactionary ruling class also shouted loudly about establishing a market town, but all they did was collect money from the people, and no market town was ever seen.
　　Now, the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas have finally been realized. At the newly built market town, the ethnic trade company and supply and marketing cooperative supplied a large number of goods that had been prepared long ago, and small vendors from Rongshui Town also came from 60 miles away. Farmers attending the market can buy all kinds of daily necessities, and Miao women are also happy to come and choose their favorite silver jewelry. Many people also recalled the development of production and the improvement of people's lives in the Da Miao Mountains since liberation, and said excitedly: "Socialism is not far away!" Lin Shijie

Mongolian Herdsmen Help Han Farmers Deliver Grain
To the Editor:
　　One day in late November 1955, I saw a continuous stream of oxcarts loaded with grain, stretching for several miles, on a main road in the Right Banner of Baling. According to national regulations, the small amount of land sown by herdsmen is not counted for production or purchase; what grain were these herdsmen hauling to the banner grain depot? I only got the answer to this question a few days later when I talked to several CCP Nuwei Secretaries (district committee secretaries) who came to the banner for a meeting.
　　This year, the state purchased about 700,000 jin of grain from Han farmers in Baiyinhantu Nurtuk Jibotu and Keteachengcha (township). It is more than 100 li back and forth from here to the banner grain depot, and it takes a long time to send 700,000 jin of grain to the depot. At this time, it happened to be on the eve of the great development of agricultural cooperation in the area, the farmers were very busy, but the grain had to be delivered in time. What to do? The neighboring Mongolian herdsmen learned about this and voluntarily offered to help their Han farmer brothers deliver the grain. After the grain was delivered to the depot, the Han farmers gratefully wanted to give the Mongolian herdsmen compensation for delivering the grain. The Mongolian herdsmen firmly refused. They said: Our farmer brothers are selling grain to support the country, and we should help deliver the purchased grain. Finally, after a lot of persuasion, the herdsmen agreed to the farmers' request and were invited to attend a simple meal.
　　Such close unity and mutual support between the Mongolian and Han peoples has never happened in history. Before liberation, under the instigation of the reactionary classes, the people of the two fraternal ethnic groups discriminated against each other and often had disputes; especially in the areas where agriculture and animal husbandry intersected, ethnic disputes caused by agricultural and pastoral contradictions were the most prominent. But today, under the glorious illumination of the great ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the agricultural and pastoral peoples of the two ethnic groups have jointly consulted and reasonably used the existing farmland and pastures, and mutual respect and mutual support have become a common practice.

    在团结友爱的民族大家庭里
    靖西县僮族农民田七丰收编辑同志：
    广西省靖西县第九区平旦、马拔、三荷、平莽等乡，是盛产田七的地区。田七，是一种名贵的药材，价格很高，1斤要值人民币100元左右。1955年冬季，田七又丰收了。在祖国南疆的这个山区里，僮族农民都带着欢愉的心情忙着收摘一年来辛勤劳动的果实。
    田七的丰收，大大改善了山区农民的生活。两年来，平旦乡平模屯的29户人家，就起了7幢新房子，还添了10匹马、10匹骡、4架打谷机和1架喷雾器。今年贫农梁恩光卖了19斤半田七，得款2，000多元，在一个圩日里就买了一匹马、一条棉被、2顶蚊帐、1张毡和4双胶鞋，还有很多余钱存到银行去。他感激地说：“要是在国民党时候，那有这样好的日子呢！”
    的确，在国民党反动统治的时候，农民种下了田七，并不能得到什么好处。正如平旦乡农会主席梁玉善所回忆的那样：种下的田七快熟了，土匪就来抢劫；平模屯在1947和1948年，就连续被土匪抢了两次。幸而收下了一些田七，拿到圩场来，地主就压价收买，农民辛苦了一年还得赔本。因此，种田七的人越来越少了。解放几年来，人民政府大力地扶植生产田七，银行给种田七的农民贷款，供销社用合理而优厚的价格收购田七，因此，田七的种植面积不断扩大，而且连年来都得到丰收，山区的僮族人民得到了富裕的生活。
    现在，在丰收以后，人们又立刻播下了新的种子。靖西县领导机关为了进一步推广田七的种植，在1955年11月和12月先后组织了全县农业社的代表到田七的产区去参观，并请种田七的能手、专区劳动模范许廷明介绍种田七的好处和种植经验。各区、乡正根据因地制宜的原则，积极扩种或试种田七。　李学明
    大苗山区建立了新圩场编辑同志：
    大苗山苗族自治地区三江门建立了圩场。这件事使附近村、屯的各族人民感到无比的兴奋和愉快。1955年11月25日建场的那一天，很多苗族姑娘换上了节日的新装，成群结队地一早就赶到了三江门。东田乡上洛屯的5户农民甚至在前一天夜里就划着小船来了。大约屯的青年们编出了山歌，来歌唱新圩场的建立，歌唱他们美好幸福的明天。
    过去，由于当地没有圩场，各族农民要出卖土、特产就得翻山越岭到几十里甚至100多里以外的地方去。在买卖东西的时候，奸商们的剥削真是敲骨吸髓。“七斤蜜糖九斤皮”（意思是出卖七斤蜜糖，反而被奸商扣掉九斤“皮”）“一个鸡蛋一枚针”（意思是卖了一个鸡蛋，只能买回一枚针），这两句话就是各族人民对过去买卖东西的辛酸描述。反动统治阶级也曾经高喊要建立圩场，但是只见他们向人民敛钱，却不见圩场的影子。
    现在，山区各族人民的愿望终于实现了。在新建的圩场上，民族贸易公司和供销合作社供应着早就准备好的大批物资，融水镇的小商贩们也从60里外赶来了。赶场的农民们可以买到各种需要的日用品，苗族妇女也高兴地来选购她们所喜爱的银手饰。不少人还回忆了解放以来大苗山区生产发展和人民生活改善的状况，兴奋地说：“社会主义已经不远了！”  蔺世杰
    蒙古族牧民帮助汉族农民送粮编辑同志：
    1955年11月下旬的一天，我在巴林右翼旗的一条大路上看到一队接连不断长达数里的满载着粮食的勒勒车。国家规定，牧民种的少量的漫撒子地是不计产、不计购的；这些牧民往旗粮食仓库拉的是什么粮食呢？这个问题，直到几天以后我同到旗里来开会的几位中共努委书记（区委书记）谈话的时候，才得到了解答。
    今年国家由白音汗努图克吉博图、克特阿成查（乡）汉族农民征购的粮食约70多万斤。从这里到旗粮库一个来回就是100多华里，送70多万斤粮食入库需要很长的时间。这时候，又恰好是当地农业合作化大发展的前夕，农民们很忙，但粮食又必须及时送缴。怎么办呢？临近的蒙古族牧民知道了，自动地提出帮助汉族农民兄弟送缴粮食。粮食入库以后，汉族农民感激地要给蒙族牧民送粮的报酬。蒙族牧民坚决地谢绝了。他们说：农民弟兄卖粮支援国家，我们帮助送缴征购粮是应该的。最后费了好大口舌，牧民才答应农民的要求，被邀参加了一次简便的会餐。
    蒙古族和汉族人民这样亲密团结互相支援的事情，在历史上是从来没有过的。解放以前，在反动阶级的挑拨下，两个兄弟民族的人民互相歧视，经常闹纠纷；特别是在农牧交错的地区，农牧矛盾所引起的民族纠纷最为突出。但是今天，在中国共产党和毛主席的伟大民族政策的光辉照耀下，两族农牧人民共同协商，合理地使用了现有的农田和草牧场，互相尊重、互相支援已经成了一种风气。　阿优
