Ngo Dinh Diem to Stage Another "Election" Farce

News from Saigon says that Ngo Dinh Diem has decided to hold a unilateral "election" on March 4th to create a so-called "National Assembly."

Originally, according to the plan set by the director, American imperialism, Ngo Dinh Diem's "election" farce was to be staged before the end of last year; however, due to widespread opposition from the domestic people and fierce criticism from international public opinion, the performance plan was repeatedly thwarted. According to Saigon Radio, Ngo Dinh Diem's unfinished farce will be staged in two acts; the first act is called "Electing the National Assembly," and the second act is called "Drafting the Constitution." According to Ngo Dinh Diem's arrangements, this time will be even more heinous than the "referendum" in October last year when Ngo Dinh Diem proclaimed himself "President." The recently announced "election regulations" stipulate that "candidates" for the 123 "parliamentarians" must have resided in a certain place in South Vietnam for more than half a year and must have a certificate proving that they have completed Ngo Dinh Diem's "military obligations." "Candidates" must pay a "campaign fee" of 2,000 yuan in advance to participate in the election. After being elected as "parliamentarians," they must immediately submit a "loyalty oath" to Ngo Dinh Diem. Ngo Dinh Diem and its "Central Supervisory Committee" also have the power to appoint and revoke the qualifications of a certain "parliamentarian" at any time. The so-called "election regulations" also stipulate that residents must participate in the "election" at the time and sign and seal their ballots; if there are any "election sabotage" or other circumstances, they will be immediately arrested and imprisoned for one to five years.

Ngo Dinh Diem's choice to stage his farce at this time is not without reason. According to the Geneva Accords, by July of this year, the Vietnamese people can exercise their sacred rights and achieve national reunification through free general elections. The date is not far off now. Therefore, under the instigation of the United States, Ngo Dinh Diem is stepping up the completion of his unilateral "election" and "constitutional" farce in order to completely undermine the Geneva Accords, permanently divide Vietnam, drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and make it an out-and-out military base for American imperialism.

As Ngo Dinh Diem's unilateral "election" farce is about to be staged, the signatory countries of the Geneva Accords and all peace-loving people in the world should stand up and condemn the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique for this act of undermining the Geneva Accords.

### 吴庭艳又要扮演“选举”丑剧了

    吴庭艳又要扮演“选举”丑剧了
    从西贡传来的消息说，吴庭艳已经决定在3月4日举行片面“选举”，以制造一个所谓“国会”。
    本来，按照导演者美帝国主义原定的计划，吴庭艳这场“选举”丑剧在去年年底之前就要上演的；但因为国内人民普遍的反对和国际舆论猛烈的抨击，演出计划一再受锉。据西贡电台说，吴庭艳这出没有演完的丑剧将要分成两幕继续上演；第一幕叫作“选举国会”，第二幕叫作“制定宪法”。根据吴庭艳的布置，这次将比去年10月吴庭艳自封“总统”的“公民投票”更加丑恶。吴庭艳最近公布的“选举条例”规定，123个“议员”的“候选人”，必须在南越某地居留半年以上，并且要有服完吴庭艳“军事义务”的证件。“候选人”参加竞选得预先缴纳2，000元“竞选费”。当选“议员”后，要立即向吴庭艳呈递一分“忠诚宣誓书”。吴庭艳和它的“中央监察委员会”并有指定和随时撤销某一“议员”资格之权。所谓“选举条例”又规定，居民届时必须参加“选举”，并在选票上签名和盖印；如有“破坏选举”等情事，立即逮捕监禁一年至五年。
    吴庭艳之所以选定在这个时候扮演他的丑剧，并不是无因的。按照日内瓦协议，到今年7月，越南人民就可以行使自己神圣的权利，通过自由普选来实现全国的统一。现在离这个日期已经不远了。因此，吴庭艳便在美国的指使下加紧完成它的片面“选举”和“立宪”的丑剧，以便彻底破坏日内瓦协议，长期分割越南，把越南南方拖入东南亚侵略集团，使其成为美帝国主义的一块不折不扣的军事基地。
    吴庭艳片面“选举”丑剧行将登场，日内瓦协议签字国和全世界一切爱好和平的人们，都应该起来谴责美国和吴庭艳集团这种破坏日内瓦协议的行为。
