Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: The 24th ordinary session of the Japanese Diet, which opened on January 24, officially began on January 30. The Japanese government plans to submit more than 200 bills to this session, including the 1956 budget案, a bill to amend the election law, and bills to establish a "Constitutional Investigation Committee" and a "National Defense Council." The common purpose of these bills is to pave the way for Japan's rearmament.

Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama delivered a policy speech in the Diet that day. He said that the Japanese government will further promote a "peaceful diplomacy" policy in the future. He also said that Japan is prepared to "further strengthen cooperation" with the "United States and other democratic countries." Hatoyama said that Japan is prepared to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union in accordance with the established policy of resolving necessary and important outstanding issues, concluding a peace treaty, and normalizing diplomatic relations. When talking about Japan's relations with Asian countries, Hatoyama expressed his willingness to make efforts to establish diplomatic relations with Southeast Asian countries and improve trade relations with China. In terms of domestic affairs, Hatoyama reiterated his government's proposal to revise the constitution and rearm.

Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu delivered a diplomatic speech.

According to Kyodo News, Shigemitsu emphasized that "close cooperation" with the United States is the "basic spirit of our national policy." Shigemitsu also said that it is necessary for Japan to give special emphasis to friendship with emerging Asian countries in its diplomacy. When talking about relations with China, Shigemitsu said that the Japanese government cannot "recognize" the Chinese government. However, he also said that "the Chinese government exists in reality." He said that the Japanese government will try to increase trade with China "within the scope of not violating international obligations." He also expressed a strong hope for seeking a peaceful solution to the "dispute in the Taiwan Strait."

Socialist Party member Tadataka Sata, in his interpellation, asked the Hatoyama government to "show enthusiasm" for restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations. He pointed out that now is the time to take concrete measures to recognize China. He advocated that Prime Minister Hatoyama or Foreign Minister Shigemitsu visit China, or invite Premier Zhou Enlai to visit Japan. He said that if the Hatoyama government does so, the Socialist Party will support it regardless of party affiliation.

In answering questions, Ichiro Hatoyama did not express a positive attitude on the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with China. He said that for the time being, efforts should be made to relax "embargo" restrictions, and then normalize diplomatic relations "according to the international situation."

Japanese public opinion expressed disappointment with the policy speeches of the government leaders. Kyodo News called on the government to "quickly liquidate two-faced diplomacy" in a commentary.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: During the Japanese Diet interpellations in the past few days, members focused on criticizing the Japanese government's policies that violate Japan's peaceful development and independence.

Socialist Party member Yoshimichi Ito raised questions about Japan's diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China at the March 3 meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee. He pointed out that now is the time to specifically normalize Japan-China diplomatic relations.

Ito also pointed out that the true situation of Japan's so-called independence can be seen from the example of the presence of American military bases in Japan. He said that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and other treaties concluded between Japan and the United States are unequal treaties.

Yoshimichi Ito also said that, judging from issues such as budget preparation and Japan-Soviet negotiations, it is difficult to believe that the Prime Minister is controlling the cabinet.

    鸠山在国会发表施政演说
    据新华社东京消息　1月24日开幕的日本国会第24次平时会议在1月30日正式开始。日本政府准备在这次会议上提出200多件法案，其中包括1956年度预算案、修改选举法法案、建立“宪法调查会”和“国防会议”的法案等。这些法案的共同目的是为日本重整军备铺平道路。
    日本首相鸠山一郎当天在国会中发表了施政方针演说。他说，日本政府今后将进一步推行“和平外交”的方针。他又说，日本准备同“美国和其他民主国家”“进一步密切合作”。鸠山说，对于苏联，准备按着解决必要的重要悬案、缔结和约、使邦交正常化的已定方针，继续进行谈判。鸠山在谈到日本对亚洲国家的关系时表示愿为建立同东南亚国家之间的邦交和改善同中国的贸易关系而作出努力。在内政方面，鸠山重申了他的政府要求修改宪法和重整军备的主张。
    外务相重光葵发表了外交演说。
    据共同社报道，重光强调同美国之间的“密切合作”是“我国国策的基本精神”。重光也说日本有必要把外交特别侧重于同亚洲新兴国家之间的友好方面。在谈到同中国的关系时，重光说，日本政府不能“承认”中国政府。但是，他又说“中国政府在现实上存在着”。他说，日本政府将在“不违反国际义务的范围内”设法增加同中国的贸易。他并且表示非常希望为“台湾海峡的争端”寻求和平解决办法。
    社会党议员佐多忠隆在质询中要求鸠山政府对恢复日中邦交“表示出热情来”。他指出，现在正是采取承认中国的具体措施的时候。他主张由鸠山首相或重光外相访问中国，或者邀请周恩来总理到日本去访问。他说，如果鸠山政府这样做，社会党将不分党派来加以支持。
    鸠山一郎在答复质询时，在对恢复同中国的邦交问题上没有表示积极的态度。他说，暂时要努力于放宽“禁运”限制，然后“根据国际形势”使邦交正常化。
    日本舆论对政府首脑的施政演说表示失望。共同社在评论中要求政府“迅速清算两面外交”。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：在这几天的日本国会质询中，议员们着重抨击了日本政府的违反日本和平发展和独立的政策。
    社会党议员伊藤好道在众议院预算委员会的3日会议上就日本同苏联和中国的邦交问题提出质询。他指出，现在正是应当具体地使日中邦交正常化的时候了。
    伊藤又指出，从日本国内存在着美国军事基地这个例子，就可以看到日本所谓独立的真实情况。他说，美日“安全条约”和日本同美国缔结的其他条约都是不平等条约。
    伊藤好道又说，从编制预算和日苏谈判等问题看来，很难认为首相是在统辖着内阁。
