    Writing Popular Political Theory Readings for Rural Readers
    He Shu
    In the face of the socialist upsurge in China's countryside, rural cadres urgently need to know many principles. Many rural cadres feel distressed in their work. They say: We do the tasks assigned to us, but we cannot summarize the experience when we succeed, and we cannot summarize the lessons when we fail. How can we succeed by groping around like this! Many rural cadres are no longer satisfied with simply remembering what the higher authorities tell them to do and how to do it. They want to know why the higher authorities make such arrangements for tasks, they want to be able to foresee the development of the work, and they want to fundamentally understand the Party and the state's guidelines and policies.
    The broad masses of peasants also need to understand basic knowledge of political theory. They know that labor is glorious and exploitation is shameful, that capitalism is doomed to die, and that socialism is to be built; terms like "spontaneous forces" and "small peasant economy" are often circulated in their mouths as disgraceful things. However, these things are mostly perceptual knowledge they get from life, only a vague and half-understood understanding.
    All these indicate that it is very necessary to publish a large number of excellent popular political theory readings for rural readers.
    There is no doubt that the theory of Marxism-Leninism can be popularized. Because the foundation of Marxism-Leninism is practice, a summary of revolutionary experience, and comes from real life, and is by no means something mysterious. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To talk about Marxism apart from Chinese characteristics is just abstract and empty Marxism." Rural cadres and peasants are practicing every day and living in an environment of revolutionary change. Therefore, they can understand and accept the basic knowledge of Marxist-Leninist theory.
    However, how can we popularize the theory of Marxism-Leninism? Marx once said: "Theory, as soon as it has gripped the masses, becomes a material force." Therefore, writing popular political theory readings for rural readers should first and foremost deeply understand and grasp the spirit and essence of the theory. Only with a deep understanding can we explain profound things in simple terms, can we popularize correctly, and can we avoid vulgarizing Marxism-Leninism. In addition, we should also pay attention to the following issues: (1) Connect and combine the production practice and class struggle practice of rural readers, and explain theoretical issues through their actual experiences. This is the most basic point. (2) The popularization of theory does not mean simplification, but requires a thorough explanation of a theoretical issue. This requires that a book should not discuss too many issues. (3) Theory should be expressed through language, and popular language is one of the important conditions for theory to penetrate rural readers. Popular political theory readings require avoiding excessive use of nouns and terms, especially avoiding explaining nouns and terms with nouns and terms.
    Today, the writing of popular political theory readings lags far behind the actual needs, mainly because some people who can write still have ideological concerns. The first concern is the fear of not being familiar enough with the rural situation and not being able to combine well with rural realities. This concern is understandable. However, this difficulty is by no means insurmountable. Although generally speaking, most of the people who can write popular political theory readings today live in cities, these people are not completely without opportunities to go to the countryside, and many of them have lived and fought in the countryside for a considerable period of time; besides, even if they have never been to the countryside and have no rural life experience at all, it is very necessary to strive to go to the countryside next time for the sake of writing. If we do not try to overcome this difficulty, but use this difficulty as an excuse for not writing, we will be blamed by rural readers.
    The second concern is that writing popular political theory readings cannot freely quote extensively, cannot greatly expand the issues for discussion and explanation, and even fear that the use of nouns and terms will be limited, believing that this will affect the "integrity and systematicness" of the theory, dilute the "theoretical flavor," and become "untheoretical." This concern is the result of opposing the popularization of theory with the complete and systematic explanation of theory, and the abstraction and mystification of theory. Because whether a theoretical issue is discussed well depends on whether the principles are explained thoroughly, not on how many citations there are.
    The third concern is the fear that writing popular theory booklets will delay their scientific research. Some people also believe that if they are to write, they should write large-scale theoretical works, and writing small booklets is meaningless. These ideas are of course wrong. Large-scale theoretical works are certainly needed, but we cannot ignore the significance of theoretical popularization work. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "What kind of theorists do we want? We want theorists who can correctly explain the actual problems that occur in history and in the revolution based on the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, and can give scientific explanations and theoretical explanations on China's economic, political, military, cultural and various other issues." At present, the broad masses of peasants urgently demand theoretical answers to the many tremendous changes that are currently taking place. Therefore, our theoretical workers have the responsibility to set aside a certain amount of time to write popular theoretical readings to meet their demands. Writing for 500 million peasants, so that the theory of Marxism-Leninism is mastered by the broad masses of peasants and transformed into a huge force for building socialism, engaging in such glorious labor, how can it be said that it is a meaningless thing!
    At present, people who write popular political theory readings, including theoretical workers, are all amateur authors. This kind of labor is hard and should be respected and honored by society. We hope that all pens that can write will move, and change the backward situation of popular political theory readings. Publishing houses have a major responsibility in organizing a team of popular political theory writers. In addition, introducing writing experience and strengthening review and evaluation work can promote the increase in the variety of popular political theory readings and improve their quality. As long as this is the case, rural readers will surely benefit more and more, and Marxism-Leninism will surely be more widely disseminated.

### 为农村读者写作通俗政治理论读物

    为农村读者写作通俗政治理论读物
    何舒
    在我国农村的社会主义高潮面前，农村干部迫切需要知道许多道理。不少农村干部工作中感到苦恼，他们说：任务下来了就干，干成了总结不出经验，干坏了总结不出教训，这样瞎摸一起，哪成！许多农村干部早已不满足于一五一十地记住上级叫干什么和叫怎么干，他们要求知道上级为什么这样布置任务，要求能够预见到工作的发展，要求从根本上理解党和国家的方针和政策。
    广大的农民群众也需要懂得政治理论常识。他们知道劳动光荣、剥削可耻，资本主义要死亡，社会主义要建成；“自发势力”、“小农经济”之类的名词，常在他们的嘴里被当作不光彩的东西流传。但是，这些东西大多是他们从生活中得来的感性认识，还只是一种模模糊糊、似懂非懂的了解。
    这些都说明，为农村读者大量出版优秀的通俗政治理论读物，是十分必要的。
    马克思列宁主义的理论能够通俗化，原是无可怀疑和毋庸争辩的。因为马克思列宁主义的基础是实践，是革命经验的总结，是从实际生活中来的，而绝不是什么玄之又玄的东西。毛泽东同志说过：“离开中国特点来谈马克思主义，只是抽象的空洞的马克思主义。”农村干部和农民天天时时都在实践，都在革命变革的环境当中生活，因此，马克思列宁主义理论的基本知识，他们是能够理解和接受的。
    但是，怎样才能使得马克思列宁主义理论通俗化呢？马克思早就说过：“理论只要一彻底化，就能够大众化地表现。”因此，写作供应农村读者的通俗政治理论读物，首先应当深刻领会和掌握理论的精神和实质。只有领会得深刻，才能做到深入浅出，才能通俗化得正确，才不至于把马克思列宁主义庸俗化了。此外，还应注意这样几个问题：（一）联系和结合农村读者的生产实践和阶级斗争实践，通过他们的实际来阐明理论问题。这是最基本的一点。（二）理论通俗化并不是说可以简单化，而是要求一竿子到底地说清说透一个理论问题。这就要求一本书中所谈问题不要太多。（三）理论要通过语言来表达，语言大众化是理论能够深入农村读者的重要条件之一。通俗政治理论读物要求避免过多地使用名词术语，特别是忌讳以名词术语解释名词术语。
    今天通俗政治理论读物的著作远远落后于实际需要，主要的一个原因就是有些能写的人还有思想顾虑。第一个顾虑是怕对农村情况不够熟悉，不能很好结合农村实际。这种顾虑是可以理解的。但是，这个困难决非无法克服。虽然一般地说，今天能写通俗政治理论读物的人，大多住在城市，但是这些人并不是完全没有机会下乡，其中还有许多人是相当长期地在农村中生活、战斗过来的；再说，即便从来没有下过乡，完全没有农村生活经验，这次为了写作，争取下一次乡也是十分必要的。如不努力克服这个困难，而以这个困难作为不动笔的借口，那是会受到农村读者的责备的。
    第二种顾虑是怕写通俗的政治理论读物不能放手地旁征博引，不能把问题大大地铺开来加以论释，甚至于怕使用名词术语有限制，认为这样就会影响了理论的“完整性和系统性”，就会冲淡了“理论气味”和“不理论”了。这种顾虑是由于把理论通俗化和完整、系统地讲理论对立起来了，是把理论抽象化和神秘化了的结果。因为理论问题论述好不好，在于道理讲得透不透，而不在于引证多不多。
    第三个顾虑是怕写作通俗理论小册子，耽误了自己的科学研究。还有一些人认为要写就得写大部头的理论著作，写小薄本没意思。这些想法当然都是错误的。大部头的理论著作固然需要，但是我们不能忽视理论普及工作的意义。毛泽东同志早就指出过：“我们所要的理论家是什么样的人呢？是要这样的理论家，他们能够依据马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，正确地解释历史中和革命中所发生的实际问题，能够在中国的经济、政治、军事、文化种种问题上给予科学的解释，给予理论的说明。”目前，广大农民迫切要求从理论上解答当前发生的许多巨大的变化，因此，我们理论工作者就有责任腾出一定时间，来写通俗的理论读物，满足他们的要求。为五亿农民写作，使马克思列宁主义的理论为广大农民所掌握，化为建设社会主义的巨大力量，从事这样光荣的劳动，怎么可以说是没有意思的事情！
    目前，写作通俗政治理论读物的人，包括理论工作者在内，都是业余著作者，这种劳动是辛苦的，是应该受到社会尊敬和得到社会荣誉的。希望所有能写的笔都动起来，改变通俗政治理论读物的落后状况。在组织通俗的政治理论著作队伍上，出版社负有重大的责任。此外，介绍写作经验，加强评介工作，都能促进通俗政治理论读物的品种增多，质量提高。只要这样，农村读者受益必将不断增多，马克思列宁主义必将得到更广泛的传播。
