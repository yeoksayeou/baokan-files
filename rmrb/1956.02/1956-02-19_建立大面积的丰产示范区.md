Establishing Large-Area High-Yield Demonstration Zones
　　Shang Kai

The experience of Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, proves that establishing large-area high-yield demonstration zones in rural areas that have achieved cooperativization is a good method for leading large-scale production.

In 1955, Hongzhao County selected the Nanqin Township area, which had a relatively good foundation of cooperativization, to establish a 15,000-mu large-area high-yield demonstration zone. The county party committee formed a comprehensive working group composed of political workers, water conservancy workers, and agricultural science and technology personnel in this high-yield area to provide unified leadership and allocation, assisting township and cooperative cadres in mobilizing the masses to carry out a series of comprehensive technical guidance and technical reforms. Under the influence and driving force of the Nanqin high-yield demonstration zone, a high-yield competition movement of "100-mu high-yield cooperatives, 1,000-mu high-yield townships, and 10,000-mu high-yield areas" was launched throughout the county. As a result, the plan for large-area high yield was realized. Among the 110 townships in the county, the 27 townships centered on the Nanqin high-yield area were the most prominent in high yield. A total of more than 54,100 mu of grain fields were planted here (completely transformed into paddy fields), with an average yield of 712 jin of raw grain per mu (two crops a year, producing 310 jin of wheat and 402 jin of corn). Some agricultural production cooperatives achieved yields of 805 jin, 910 jin, and even 1,180 jin per mu, breaking the county's record for unit area yield, shattering the "peak production" mentality that was popular among some staff and masses at the time, and inspiring the enthusiasm of farmers throughout the county to increase production.

The advantages of this approach are: First, it is convenient to concentrate efforts to carry out comprehensive guidance of various agricultural technologies and give full play to the role of science and technology. Second, it is powerful and effective, and more persuasive and inspiring to the masses than small high-yield demonstration plots, promoting the production movement throughout the county. Third, it can improve the thinking of leaders, strengthen their confidence, and prevent them from falling into narrow and conservative circles.

The experience of Hongzhao County in establishing large-area high-yield demonstration zones is successful. At present, the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China is promoting it throughout the region. This year, it plans to establish 1 million mu of large-area high-yield cotton fields, requiring 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu (the average yield per mu in the region in 1955 was 41 jin); and to establish 300,000 mu of large-area high-yield grain fields, requiring 1,000 jin of raw grain (wheat and corn) per mu. In order to ensure the completion of the high-yield tasks, the counties are mobilizing the masses to accumulate fertilizer in large quantities, build water conservancy projects, regulate improved varieties, and carry out various technical preparations. A large-scale high-yield competition movement is about to unfold in all 30 counties of Jinan.

    建立大面积的丰产示范区
    商恺
    山西省洪赵县的经验证明：在实现了合作化的农村，建立大面积丰产示范区，是领导大生产的一个好方法。
    1955年，洪赵县选择合作化基础较好的南秦乡一带，建立了一个15，000亩的大面积丰产示范区。县委在这个丰产区，把政治工作人员、水利工作人员和农业科学技术人员，组成了综合工作组，统一领导和调配，协助乡和社的干部，发动群众，进行了一系列全面的技术指导和技术改革。在南秦丰产示范区的影响和带动下，全县开展了“百亩丰产社，千亩丰产乡，万亩丰产片”的丰产竞赛运动。结果，实现了大面积丰产的计划。在全县110个乡中间，以南秦丰产区为核心的27个乡丰产最为突出。这里共播种粮田54，100余亩（完全变成了水田），平均每亩产原粮712斤（一年两熟，产小麦310斤，玉米402斤）。其中有些农业生产合作社每亩产量达到了805斤、910斤，直到1，180斤，打破了全县单位面积产量的纪录，粉碎了当时流行在某些工作人员和群众中的“增产到顶”思想，鼓舞了全县农民的增产积极性。
    这种作法的好处是：一、便于集中力量，进行各种农业技术的综合指导，充分发挥科学技术的作用。二、声势浩大，成绩显著，比小块丰产示范田更能说服群众，鼓舞群众，推动全县的生产运动。三、能提高领导者的思想，坚定领导者的信心，使领导者不致陷到狭隘保守的圈子里。
    洪赵县建立大面积丰产示范区的经验是成功的。目前，中共晋南地委正在全区范围内推广。今年，打算建立大面积棉田丰产区100万亩，要求每亩产皮棉100斤（1955年全区平均每亩产41斤）；建立大面积粮田丰产区30万亩，要求每亩产原粮（小麦、玉米）1，000斤。各县为了保证完成丰产任务，正在发动群众大量积肥，兴修水利，调剂良种，进行各种技术准备。一个大规模的丰产竞赛运动，即将在晋南30个县全面展开。
