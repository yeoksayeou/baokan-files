Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

I feel very honored to participate in the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I wholeheartedly support the reports of Chairman Zhou Enlai and all the leaders, and I will implement them with practical actions. I am a minority cadre from the Qaidam Basin area of ​​Qinghai. Now I will report to the conference on the support of the local people of all ethnic groups for the resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin.

The Qaidam Basin is a fertile and resource-rich virgin land and treasure bowl of the motherland. The basin has an area of ​​approximately 220,000 square kilometers, and the industrious and simple Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazakh, Han, Hui, Tu, and Salar ethnic groups are distributed in the central and marginal areas of the basin. The basin has a large amount of fertile arable wasteland and vast and abundant pastures, and animal husbandry and agriculture have broad prospects for development. In particular, after exploration, it has been confirmed that the basin not only contains rich oil, but also has mineral deposits such as coal, lead, iron, and borax. According to the current exploration data, not only is the oil-bearing rock widely distributed in the basin, but the oil-bearing and capping layers are also very good, and there are many obvious oil-bearing structures. The exploration personnel said happily: "We travel on the back of oil and on oil mountains every day." The first deep exploration well, which started drilling in November last year, has spewed crude oil from a depth of more than 320 meters.

As everyone knows, the exploration and development of oil and other mineral resources in the Qaidam Basin of the motherland marks the victorious progress of our motherland's socialist industrialization. The people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai and the Qaidam Basin also deeply realize that the exploration of the Qaidam Basin in the motherland will completely change the backward economic and cultural outlook of our nation. Therefore, our Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, in accordance with the instructions of higher authorities, has listed supporting the Qaidam exploration work as our regular central work task. In March 1955, the Qaidam Affairs Offices were established at both the prefectural and county levels. Cadres at all levels and people of all ethnic groups are all excited to support the resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin. They said, "Supporting the Qaidam Basin is our due responsibility. Whatever is needed, and whatever we have, we will support. Wherever we are needed, we will go." For example, the Tibetan people in Tianjun County often prepare more than 2,000 pack yaks, ready to go whenever needed. The Mongolians in Dulan County, such as Chaka Banner, organized strong pack animals into transportation teams of large, medium, and small sizes and groups, and uniformly allocated them. The strong ones transported them far away, and the slightly weaker ones transported them nearby. Over the past year, we have achieved remarkable results in supporting the resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin.

In order to ensure that the exploration personnel can enter the basin in time to carry out their work, in 1955, under the guidance and assistance of the working group sent to Haixi by the province, we first concentrated our efforts on repairing more than 300 kilometers of sandy and slurry areas of the Golmud-Mangai Highway, which played a key role in transporting exploration personnel and ensuring supplies. After March, we also repaired the Chaka-Gansen Highway, the Golmud-Dunhuang Highway, and the Mahai-Youdun Highway that run across the basin. This will have a more significant meaning and effect on supporting the resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin.

In order to ensure the supply of materials, in terms of transportation: Over the past year, the people of all ethnic groups in Haixi have organized 1,802 camels, 4,303 yaks, more than 100 horses, and 69 carts to supplement the shortage of transportation capacity, completing the task of transporting 1,500 cubic meters of timber, 600,000 catties of coal, 400,000 catties of firewood, and 711,643 catties of seeds.

In terms of material supply: The state has transported a large amount of grain, department stores, cloth, and daily non-staple food to ensure the living needs of the exploration personnel. People of all ethnic groups have provided approximately 25,000 catties of various meats (including some wild animal meat). In addition, banks, post and telecommunications, Xinhua Bookstore, trade and grain commercial departments have all established institutions in Golmud, Mangai, and other places to serve the exploration personnel.

In order to ensure the long-term grain needs of exploration personnel and other aspects in the basin, in 1955, we expanded the Delingha Farm and built the Golmud Farm. With the strong support of the people of all ethnic groups and the hard work of the farm workers, we increased grain production (the total output of the Delingha Farm in 1955 was 320 catties per mu). We are now continuing to build pastures and farms in Nomuhong, Xiangride, Chahanwusu, and other places, which will increase more grain and meat.

The people of all ethnic groups have shown a high degree of enthusiasm and unity and patriotism in supporting the resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin. For example, the masses in the small agricultural areas helped the family members of the personnel working in the basin to pull manure, sow seeds, and water, etc.; the herdsmen also contributed a lot of manpower and livestock to help them with farming, etc. In transportation, the people of all ethnic groups especially cherish state property. For example, if the grain bags were broken, they would unload them and sew them up. If they could not be sewn, they would wrap them in fur coats before transporting them. When they encountered difficult places to walk, they would unload the burdens and carry them over before transporting them again. Even the grains scattered on the ground would be picked up one by one and sent to the farm. The fair and respected leaders who have close ties with the people of all ethnic groups have also supported the Qaidam Basin with active, enthusiastic, and leading practical actions. For example, Kazakh Ni Hamaiti (Vice Chairman of the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) personally led the way, passing through the vast Gobi Desert without water and grass for four days to complete the task. According to statistics, there were 489 people from all ethnic groups in Haixi participating in translation, guiding, and carrying, and more than 1,490 lumberjacks. The masses of all ethnic groups have found and reported more than a thousand mineral deposits.

Although we have achieved the above results, due to our insufficient publicity and education and political mobilization work, some individuals still have some different doubts in their minds. For example, some say, "Supporting is supporting, but how long will it take to dig through such a big mountain." Some people are also afraid that taking the treasure will damage the feng shui and be detrimental to people and animals, so their confidence is not high enough. There are other shortcomings in material supply and organization of transportation. These shortcomings must be overcome and corrected in the future. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the higher-level People's Committee, we will unite as one, persevere in our efforts in various positions, raise our vigilance, and successfully complete the support tasks for 1956.

    王德海的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我能参加中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议，感觉非常荣幸。我衷心拥护周恩来主席和各位首长的报告，并要以实际行动去贯彻执行。我是青海柴达木盆地地区的一个少数民族干部。现在我将当地各族人民支援柴达木盆地资源勘察工作，向大会作一汇报。
    柴达木盆地是祖国一幅土地肥美、蕴藏富饶的处女地和聚宝盆。盆地面积约有22万平方公里，分布在盆地中部和边缘的有勤劳朴实的蒙古、藏、哈萨克族、汉、回、土、撒拉等民族，盆地有大量肥美的可耕荒地和广阔丰美的牧场，牧、农业都有广阔发展的前途。特别是经过勘察证实，盆地不仅蕴藏丰富的石油，而且还有煤、铅、铁、硼砂等矿藏。按现在勘察取得的资料来看，盆地内不仅含油岩分布很广，储油层和盖油层很好，储油构造多而明显。勘察人员高兴的说：“我们天天在石油背上和油山上旅行。”去年11月开钻的第一口深探钻井，深钻约320多公尺，就有原油夺口而出。
    大家知道，祖国柴达木石油及其他矿藏的勘察和开发，标志着我们祖国社会主义工业化事业正在胜利的前进着。我们青海和柴达木盆地的各族人民，也深切的认识到祖国柴达木的勘察，将会彻底改变我们民族落后的经济、文化面貌。因此，我们海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州根据上级的指示，把支援柴达木勘察工作列为我们经常的中心工作任务。1955年3月先后成立了州、县两级柴达木事务办公室。各级干部和各族人民，都为祖国支援柴达木资源勘察工作而感到兴奋。他们说：“支援柴达木是我们应尽的责任，需要什么，有什么，就支援什么，需要到那里就到那里。”譬如天峻县藏族人民经常准备2，000多头驮牛，啥时要，啥时到。都兰县蒙古族茶卡等旗把精壮驮畜编成运输大、中、小队和小组，统一调配，精壮的远处运输，稍弱的近处运输。一年来，我们在开展支援柴达木资源勘察工作方面，取得了显著的成绩。
    为了保证勘察人员能及时进入盆地开展工作，1955年在省派往海西工作团指导和协助下，首先集中全力抢修葛尔穆至茫崖公路300余公里的绵沙、泛浆地带，对运送勘探人员及保证供应上起了关键性的作用。3月以后，又抢修了横穿盆地的茶（卡）甘（森）公路、葛（尔穆）敦（煌）公路和马海至油敦的公路。这对支援柴达木资源勘察工作，将有更重大的意义和作用。
    为了保证物资供应，在运输方面：一年来海西各族人民组织骆驼1，802峰、牦牛4，303头、马100多匹、大车69辆，补充运输力的不足，完成驮运木材1，500立方公尺、煤炭60万斤、烧柴40万斤和籽种711，643斤的任务。
    物资供应方面：国家运入了大批的粮食、百货、布匹和日用副食品，保证了勘察人员的生活需要。各族人民支援各种肉食（包括部分野牲肉）约25，000余斤。另外，银行、邮电、新华书店、贸易和粮食商业部门均在葛尔穆、茫崖等地设立了机构，为勘察人员服务。
    为了长远的保证盆地勘察人员和其他方面的粮食需要，1955年我们扩建了德令哈农场，新建了葛尔穆农场，在各族人民大力支援和农场职工辛勤劳动下，增产了粮食（德令哈农场1955年通产为每亩320斤），现在还在继续筹建诺木洪、香日德、察汗乌苏等地牧场和农场，将会增加更多的粮食和肉食。
    各族人民在支援祖国柴达木资源勘察工作中，都表现了高度的热情和团结爱国的精神。例如，小块农业区的群众帮助进入盆地工作的人员家属拉粪、下种、浇水等；牧民群众也出了许多人力畜力，帮助其种地等。在运输中，各族人民特别爱护国家财产，譬如驮运粮食袋子破了，卸下来缝好，不能缝的用皮袄包住再运。遇见难走的地方，驮子卸下来背过去再运。就是撒在地上的粮食也要一粒粒拣起来送给农场。与各族人民群众有联系的公正领袖人物，也都以积极热情带头的实际行动支援柴达木。例如哈萨克族尼哈买提（中国人民政治协商会议青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州委员会副主席）亲自带路，通过四天无水无草的大戈壁，完成任务。据统计，海西各族人民参加翻译、向导和驮员有489人，伐木工人1，490多人。各族群众找矿、报矿千余起。
    虽然取得以上成绩，但是由于我们宣传教育、政治鼓动工作作的不够，个别人在思想上还存在着某些不同的疑虑。如说：“支援是支援，那么大的山几时能挖透。”也有的人怕取了宝，伤了风水，对人、畜不利，因之信心还不够高。其他在物资供应和组织运输方面都有着不少缺点，这些缺点，今后必须注意克服和纠正过来。在中国共产党及上级人民委员会领导下，团结一致，在各个不同岗位上坚持不懈的努力，提高警惕，胜利完成1956年的支援任务。
