Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 21st—Workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant set a new daily output record since the plant opened on the 20th. The excess steel they produced for the country on this day could be used to manufacture more than 6,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows.
Last year, the steelmaking plant set two new daily output records, on January 31st and December 15th. This year, in just the few days after the Spring Festival, the steelworkers have continuously set two new daily output records. The first was created on February 17th. The record set on the 20th produced more than 100 tons of steel than the 17th.
In the past five days, steelworkers have been producing several hundred tons of steel in excess of the quota for the country every day, with an average daily production of more than 800 tons of steel than the average daily output last year. In these five days, steelworkers smelted 44 heats of rapid steelmaking, 46% more than the total rapid steelmaking in July last year.

    鞍钢炼钢厂再创日产量最高纪录
    新华社鞍山21日电　鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂职工在20日再次创造了开厂以来日产量的最高纪录，他们在这一天为国家超额生产的钢，可以制造6，000多台双轮双铧犁。
    去年，炼钢厂曾经在1月31日、12月15日创造过两次日产量新纪录；而今年，仅在春节以后的几天中，炼钢工人们就连续创了两次日产量新纪录。第一次是2月17日创造的。20日所创造的纪录，比17日又多产了100多吨钢。
    炼钢工人们在最近5天以来，每天都为国家超额生产几百吨钢，每天平均比去年平均日产量多生产800多吨钢。这5天中，炼钢工人炼出了44炉快速炼钢，比去年7月份全月的快速炼钢还多46％。
