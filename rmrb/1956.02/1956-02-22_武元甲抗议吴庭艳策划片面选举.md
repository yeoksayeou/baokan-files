Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 20th – According to the Vietnam News Agency: General Võ Nguyên Giáp, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, formally lodged a strong protest in a letter to Mr. Parthasarathi, Chairman of the International Commission for Vietnam and Indian Ambassador, on February 17th, against Ngô Đình Diệm's plotting of unilateral "elections" in early March and the establishment of concentration camps in South Vietnam.

In the letter, General Võ Nguyên Giáp pointed out that the American interventionists and the South Vietnamese authorities must be held responsible for these acts that violate the Geneva Accords. The High Command of the French Union Forces, which signed the Geneva Accords, must also be held responsible for this.

The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army believes that the International Commission should express its attitude towards these serious violations of the agreement and put forward the following requirements to the Commission:

	I. Declare that the unilateral "elections" held in South Vietnam will be a new obstacle to the implementation of the Geneva Accords; this "election", which is a conspiracy to permanently divide Vietnam, violates the political solution stipulated in the Geneva Accords, the purpose of which is to consolidate lasting peace and realize the unification of Vietnam through free general elections nationwide;

	II. Declare that the No. 6 "Decree" promulgated by the South Vietnamese authorities on January 11, 1956, is incompatible with the spirit and letter of the Geneva Accords, especially with the provisions of Article 14C of the Geneva Accords and Article 9 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference; recommend that the High Command of the French Union Forces and the South Vietnamese government abolish this "Decree";

	III. Clarify the International Commission's clear attitude towards the above two issues, and notify the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference of its opinions and attitude.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi – Saigon Dispatch: As the unilateral election campaign in South Vietnam began, Ngô Đình Diệm used violence to suppress opposition parties.

According to Agence France-Presse, Ngô Đình Diệm's police arrested Phan Quang Đán, Secretary-General of the "Republican Party," on the evening of February 18th. On the same day, Ngô Đình Diệm sent troops to occupy Tây Ninh, the center of the Cao Đài religion, and Pope Phạm Công Tắc was forced to flee.

Phan Quang Đán had previously represented some parties opposing Ngô Đình Diệm, attacking Ngô Đình Diệm for not giving them "basic democratic rights" to carry out activities, and demanded that Ngô Đình Diệm revise the election regulations for the unilateral elections. Recently, Phan Quang Đán also organized the "National Group for the Struggle for the Establishment of a Democratic National Assembly." Phạm Công Tắc had long been dissatisfied with Ngô Đình Diệm's exclusion of the Cao Đài religion, and some Cao Đài troops had fled to the mountains of Tây Ninh to oppose Ngô Đình Diệm.

Opposition to Ngô Đình Diệm in South Vietnam is becoming more widespread, and many people who previously supported Ngô Đình Diệm are now rising up against him. Political groups such as the phục quốc hội (Restoration Association), the Socialist Party, the "National Resistance League," and the "Revolutionary Committee" have also been opposing Ngô Đình Diệm. The Hòa Hảo religious troops active in the wealthy western region of South Vietnam have pinned down several battalions of Ngô Đình Diệm's troops.

Now, former South Vietnamese Prime Minister Trần Văn Hữu is also opposing Ngô Đình Diệm's unilateral elections.

None of these opposition parties participated in the so-called "campaign" for this unilateral election. As of February 19th, the list of "candidates" announced by Ngô Đình Diệm in various districts did not include a single member of the opposition, and Ngô Đình Diệm's "National Revolutionary Movement" and his loyal pawns had already secretly divided up the seats for "National Assembly" representatives in various districts.

    武元甲抗议吴庭艳策划片面选举
    新华社河内20日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军2月17日在给越南国际委员会主席、印度大使帕塔萨拉蒂的一封信中，对于吴庭艳策划在3月初举行片面“选举”和在南越设立集中营的行为，正式提出了强硬抗议。
    武元甲将军在信中指出，美国干涉者和南越当局必须对这些违反日内瓦协定的行为负责。在日内瓦协定上签字的法兰西联邦部队总司令部也必须对此负责。
    越南人民军总司令部认为国际委员会应该对这些严重违反协定的行为表示态度，并且向委员会提出以下的要求：
  一、声明南越举行的片面“选举”将是执行日内瓦协定的新障碍；这种阴谋永远分裂越南的“选举”，是违反日内瓦协定中规定的政治解决办法的，这些规定的目的在于巩固持久和平和通过全国自由普选来实现越南的统一；
    二、声明南越当局1956年1月11日公布的第六号“法令”是同日内瓦协定的精神和文字不相容的，特别是同日内瓦协定第十四条丙款以及日内瓦会议最后宣言第九条的规定不相容的；建议法兰西联邦部队总司令部和南越政府取消这个“法令”；
    三、阐明国际委员会对上述两个问题的明确态度，并且把它的意见和所持的态度通知日内瓦会议的两位主席。
    据新华社河内电　西贡消息：在南越的片面选举竞选活动开始的时候，吴庭艳用暴力来镇压反对党派。
    据法新社报道，吴庭艳的警察在2月18日晚上逮捕了“共和党”总书记潘光诞。同一天，吴庭艳派军队占领了高台教的中心西宁，教主范公稷已经被迫逃走。
    潘光诞曾经代表一些反对吴庭艳的党派攻击吴庭艳不给他们进行活动的“基本民主权利”，要求吴庭艳修改片面选举的选举条例，最近潘光诞又组织了“为争取成立民主国会而斗争的国家集团”。范公稷长时期不满意吴庭艳对高台教的排挤，一些高台教军队曾经逃到西宁山区去反对吴庭艳。
    南越反对吴庭艳的人越来越广泛，许多以前支持吴庭艳的人现在也起来反对他。复国会、社会党、“国家抗战联盟”和“革命委员会”等政治集团也一直在反对吴庭艳。在南越富饶的西部地区活动的和好教军队钳制住了吴庭艳几个营的军队。
    现在法国的前南越总理陈文友也反对吴庭艳的片面选举。
    这些反对派都没有参加这次片面选举的所谓“竞选”活动。到2月19日为止，吴庭艳公布的各区的“候选人”的名单中，没有一个反对派的人，吴庭艳的“国家革命运动”和他的忠实爪牙已经在暗中瓜分了各个地区的“国会”代表席位。
