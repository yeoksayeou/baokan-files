    Sichuan Begins Sowing Early Rice
    (Our newspaper Chengdu, 25th dispatch) Farmers in Luxian, Yibin, Jiangjin and other areas of Sichuan Province have begun planting early rice ahead of schedule. In 3.6 million mu of fields in Longchang, Hejiang and other 6 counties, people are plowing and harrowing everywhere. Jiang'an County has completed 20% of its early rice planting. In order to protect the seedlings, many agricultural cooperatives are covering the seedbeds with frost-proof thatched mats. In Fushun County, more than 2 billion jin of fertilizer were accumulated in just over a month, a fourfold increase over the total amount of fertilizer accumulated last year. Meishan County has launched a drought-resistant and water-conservation campaign, with 4,000 waterwheels drawing water to soak the fields every day, ensuring water for transplanting.
