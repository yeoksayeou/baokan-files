Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 13th: According to newspaper reports, the Indonesian-Dutch negotiations in Geneva broke down on February 11th. A joint communiqué issued after the final meeting stated: "The Indonesian-Dutch talks have ended today without reaching any agreement. The two delegations have differences of opinion on the procedures for resolving the dispute, and these differences cannot be resolved at present."

These negotiations began two months ago. After a period of suspension, the negotiations resumed on February 8th. According to newspaper reports, no substantive discussions on Indonesia's sovereignty over West Irian were held during the entire negotiation process. The Dutch side insisted on submitting the dispute between the two countries to the International Court of Justice for arbitration, while the Indonesian side believed that this was actually an infringement of Indonesia's sovereignty. The Dutch side also attempted to force Indonesia to accept conditions aimed at consolidating the position of Dutch capital.

From the beginning, Indonesian public opinion pointed out that the negotiations conducted by the Harahap government with the Netherlands would not yield results favorable to Indonesia's national interests. During the negotiation process, many parties and groups demanded that the government stop negotiations that did not touch on the issue of sovereignty over West Irian, and criticized the government for temporarily shelving the discussion of the West Irian issue in the United Nations General Assembly due to negotiations with the Netherlands. The Indonesian Muslim Teachers Association and the Indonesian Islamic Union Party even withdrew their ministers from the Harahap cabinet on January 19th for this reason.

The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper said on February 13th that after the failure of the Geneva negotiations, the Harahap cabinet should have no reason to exist any longer. The newspaper called on the parliament to take steps to end the Harahap cabinet's policies which endangered Indonesia's national interests.

The "Independent" newspaper said that the failure of the Geneva negotiations has fully demonstrated that the Harahap cabinet should return its mandate.

    印度尼西亚和荷兰的谈判破裂
    新华社雅加达13日电　据报纸消息，在日内瓦举行的印度尼西亚—荷兰谈判已经在2月11日破裂。最后一次会议后发表的联合公报说：“印度尼西亚—荷兰的会谈已经在今天结束，没有达成任何协议。双方代表团在拟定解决纠纷的程序上意见有分歧，这种分歧在目前不能获得解决。”
    这次谈判是在两个月前开始的。谈判在一度停顿后于2月8日恢复。据报纸消息，在整个谈判期间，没有举行关于印度尼西亚对西伊里安的主权问题的实质性的讨论。荷兰方面坚持要把两国间的纠纷提交国际法庭仲裁，而印度尼西亚方面认为这实际上是侵犯印度尼西亚的主权。荷兰方面还企图迫使印度尼西亚接受目的在于巩固荷兰资本的地位的条件。
    印度尼西亚舆论从一开头就指出，哈拉哈普政府同荷兰进行的这次谈判，不会得出有利于印度尼西亚民族利益的结果。在谈判过程中，许多党派和团体要求政府停止不触及西伊里安主权问题的谈判，并且指责政府由于同荷兰进行谈判而使联合国大会暂时搁置了对西伊里安问题的讨论。印度尼西亚回教师联合会和印度尼西亚回教联盟党并且为此在1月19日撤回了它们在哈拉哈普内阁中的部长。
    2月13日的“印度尼西亚火炬报”说，在日内瓦谈判失败后，哈拉哈普内阁应该没有理由再存在下去。这家报纸要求国会采取步骤结束哈拉哈普内阁的危及印度尼西亚民族利益的政策。
    “独立报”说，日内瓦谈判的失败已经充分说明哈拉哈普内阁应当交回它的委任书。
