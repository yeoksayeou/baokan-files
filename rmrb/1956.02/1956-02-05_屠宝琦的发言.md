    Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow attendees:
    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report on the issue of intellectuals, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries, and Committee Member Chen Boda's report on the socialist transformation of Chinese agriculture.
    I am a medical education and medical science research worker. In the past 6 years, under the leadership of the Party, through regular political study and a series of political movements (land reform, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Three-Anti Campaign, ideological remolding, the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, etc.), my political awareness has improved to a certain extent. However, measuring this against the demands of socialist construction development, it is far from enough. Especially after the vigorous development of national agricultural cooperation and the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, this gap has become more apparent. The high tide of agricultural cooperation and the socialist transformation of industry and commerce is a natural law of socialist construction development. With the arrival of the high tide, there will inevitably be many new requirements in all aspects. In terms of medicine and health, it has been proposed in rural areas to eliminate the most harmful parasitic diseases (schistosomiasis, filariasis, etc.) to protect the health of farmers and enable them to actively participate in agricultural production. In the industrial field, because the vigorous development of agricultural cooperation and the socialist transformation of industry and commerce has promoted its rapid development, it will inevitably require more medical and health cadres. We medical education and medical science research workers should shoulder this task, train a large number of qualified senior medical and health cadres, and research more effective methods for the prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases (schistosomiasis, etc.) and infectious diseases (encephalitis, etc.). The demands on us are so urgent in all aspects, but the number of medical education and medical science research workers in the country cannot be increased significantly in a short time. To complete this task, we can only give full play to everyone's potential power. As for how to give full play? In my opinion, intellectuals should strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism under the leadership of the Party and continue to improve their political level so that they can actively participate in socialist construction. However, the most important key is how to enable intellectuals to realize that politics must be combined with professional work in order to maximize their work power. For example, if we can understand that the science of socialist system countries is dialectical materialism, and the characteristic of dialectical materialism is that it has class nature, that is, science should serve the proletariat, not the bourgeoisie. Therefore, in our teaching, we must expose and criticize reactionary metaphysical idealism, and we must also tell students that science is to serve the people's happiness, not capitalists and warmongers. On the other hand, we must also strengthen students' patriotic education and communist moral education. Taking the microbiology teaching and research group I am in charge of as an example, we should introduce China's ancient and modern achievements in microbiology when lecturing, as well as the great victories of New China after liberation in preventing cholera, plague, smallpox, measles, tetanus neonatorum, venereal diseases, and other diseases. We should also pay attention to students' physical health and cultivate their good qualities such as respecting teachers, loving public property, and thrift. In other words, we must cultivate them into all-round developed talents. Such talents are in line with the needs of the country. Looking at last year's campaign to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, we found that many graduates from colleges and universities had political problems, and some were even counter-revolutionaries. This is related to the fact that we only cared about professional work and did not care about politics in our education of students in the past, and we should bear considerable responsibility. Secondly, we need to carry out scientific research work. The research direction should be combined with practice, but it cannot be said that theoretical research is completely unnecessary. Therefore, we must first respond to the requirements of the state for our medical and health workers in agricultural cooperation, that is, to complete the improved research work on the prevention and treatment methods of schistosomiasis, filariasis, etc., and also assist other production units to solve some difficult problems. For example, my teaching and research group has assisted Zhejiang's cotton yarn and cloth company in solving the problem of mildew prevention of cotton cloth, and assisted the aquatic products bureau in preventing and controlling bacterial gastroenteritis of grass carp.
    If you can always combine politics with professional work, you will also have a spontaneous desire to learn from the Soviet Union. Whether it is appropriate to improve our work strength based on the above points, please criticize and correct me. Finally, I wish all committee members and all attendees good health.

    屠宝琦的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位列席同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告、郭沫若副主席关于知识分子问题的报告、董必武副主席关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告、陈伯达委员关于中国农业的社会主义改造的报告。
    我是一个医学教育和医学科学研究工作者，6年来在党的领导下，通过经常的政治学习和一系列的政治运动（土地改革、抗美援朝、镇反、三反、思想改造、肃反等），在政治觉悟上虽有一定的提高，但是拿社会主义建设的发展对我的要求来衡量是远远不够的，尤其是在全国农业合作化和工商业社会主义改造的蓬勃开展后，这个距离表现得更明显了。农业合作化和工商业社会主义改造的高潮来到，这是社会主义建设发展的必然规律。随着高潮的来到，一定要对各方面有许多新的要求，在医药卫生方面来讲，在农村中已提出要求消灭危害最大的寄生虫病（血吸虫病、血丝虫病等），来保障农民的身体健康，使能积极地参加农业生产。在工业方面因为农业合作化和工商业社会主义改造的蓬勃开展，促进了它的迅速发展，亦必然要提出需要更多的医药卫生干部的要求。我们医学教育和医学科学研究工作者，应当担负起这方面的任务，来培养大批合乎规格的高级医药卫生干部，并对寄生虫病（血吸虫病等）及传染病（脑炎等）的预防和治疗方面研究出更有效的方法。各方面对我们的要求这样迫切，但是全国的医学教育和医学科学研究工作者的人数一时不能大量的增加，要完成这个任务，只有发挥每个人的一切潜在力量。至于如何发挥呢？据我的意见，知识分子应当在党的领导下加强马克思列宁主义学习，继续不断的提高政治水平，使能积极地参加社会主义建设，但是最重要的关键是如何使知识分子能够体会到政治必须与业务相结合，才能发挥他们工作的最大力量。例如倘使能理解社会主义体系国家的科学是辩证唯物的，辩证唯物的特点是有阶级性的，就是科学应当为无产阶级服务，而不是为资产阶级服务的，因此我们在教学中必须揭露和批判反动的形而上学的唯心主义学说，亦必须告诉学生，科学是为人民谋幸福服务的，不是为资本家和战争贩子服务的。另一方面，还须加强对学生的爱国主义教育和共产主义道德教育。拿我所担任的微生物学教研组来讲，讲课时应当介绍我国古代和现代在微生物学上的成就，解放后新中国对预防霍乱、鼠疫、天花、麻疹、初生儿破伤风、花柳病等疾病的伟大胜利。其他亦要注意学生的身体健康，并养成他们尊敬师长、爱护公物、节约等的优良品质。换句话来讲，要培养他们成为全面发展的人材，这样的人材，才合乎国家的需要。我们拿去年的肃反来看，许多高等学校的毕业生中发现不少在政治上有问题的，甚至有的是反革命分子，这是与我们过去对于学生的教育，只管业务而不管政治有关，应当负相当的责任。其次，需要开展科学研究工作。研究方针要结合实际，但亦不能说理论方面完全不要研究，因此，我们首先要响应国家进行农业合作化中对我们医药卫生工作者的要求，就是要完成血吸虫病、血丝虫病等防治方法的改进研究工作，同时亦应当协助其他生产单位解决一些困难问题，例如我的教研组曾协助浙江的花纱布公司解决棉布防霉问题，协助水产局防治青草鱼的细菌性胃肠炎等。
    倘使你能够经常做到政治与业务相结合时，对于向苏联的学习，亦会出于自发的要求了。根据以上几点来提高我们的工作力量，是否得当，请予批评和指正。最后敬祝各位委员、各位列席同志身体健康。
