Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 23rd: Budapest Dispatch: Stetson Kennedy, an American writer and journalist who has been to China, issued a statement to the press in Budapest, revealing that the U.S. State Department is attempting to revoke his passport because he publicly opposes Dulles' policies.

Kennedy's statement pointed out that he learned of the State Department's intention from a letter from Nagy, the U.S. Deputy Consul in Budapest. Nagy said that instructions from Washington stipulated that his passport could only be used for direct return to the United States, and that he was required to return home before March.

Kennedy protested the State Department's action and has applied to the Passport Office, requesting again that his passport be extended, which should not expire until April 1957.

Kennedy pointed out in his application that since 1952, when he testified to the United Nations agency in Geneva about forced labor in the United States, there have been attempts to revoke his passport. His objective reporting on the socialist camp's desire for peace and his criticism of Dulles' "brink of war" policy caused displeasure within the State Department. Later, when he published a report on the U.S. government treating Chinese students detained in the United States like criminals, the State Department once again wanted to take back his passport.

Kennedy said that Dulles issues passports to reactionaries who agree with his policies to travel to other socialist countries, but does not grant this right to liberals and progressives who disagree with his policies.

Kennedy's application stated: "Indeed, this applicant has made the utmost effort to engage in activities both domestically and abroad, frequently for the purpose of promoting peace, ending imperialism, eliminating racism, and eradicating the exploitation of man by man." If these activities happened to benefit the Communist Party rather than others, "certainly, neither the applicant nor the Communist Party has anything to be blamed for."

    美国作家的控诉
    新华社布拉格23日电　布达佩斯消息：曾经到过中国的美国作家、新闻记者斯蒂逊·肯尼迪在布达佩斯向报界发表声明，揭露美国国务院因为他公开反对杜勒斯政策而企图吊销他的出国护照。
    肯尼迪的声明指出，他从美国驻布达佩斯副领事纳吉的一封来信中知道了美国国务院的这个企图。纳吉说，华盛顿的指令规定他的护照只能用于直接返回美国，并且要他在3月份以前回到国内。
    肯尼迪抗议国务院的这一行动，已经向护照申请局提出申请，再度要求延长他的护照有效期限，他的护照应该是到1957年4月才满期的。
    肯尼迪在申请书中指出：自从1952年他向联合国驻日内瓦的机构指证美国的强迫劳动以来，就有人一直企图吊销他的护照。他对社会主义阵营国家要和平的意愿的客观报道和对杜勒斯“战争边缘”政策的抨击引起了国务院的不愉快。后来，当他发表了美国政府对待拘留在美国的中国学生像对待犯人一样的报道之后，国务院又再一次要收回他的护照。
    肯尼迪说：杜勒斯把护照发给同意他的政策的反动分子到其他的社会主义国家旅行，但是不把这个权利给不同意他的政策的自由主义者和进步人士。
    肯尼迪的申请书说：“的的确确，我这个申请者曾经尽最大的努力在国内和国外经常从事为了推进和平事业、结束帝国主义、消灭种族主义和根绝人对人的剥削的活动。”假如这些活动发生了有利于共产党而不是其他人的话，“肯定的，申请者或共产党都没有什么可以非难之处”。
