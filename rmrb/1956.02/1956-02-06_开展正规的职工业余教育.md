    Developing regular on-the-job vocational education, and establishing various levels of spare-time schools from elementary to university, is an effective way to improve the cultural and technical level of the vast number of workers and cultivate talents for national construction.

    In accordance with the central government's policy of comprehensive planning and strengthened leadership, and the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, literacy classes and spare-time elementary schools within the on-the-job vocational education system should adopt the working policy of "massive development, attention to quality." Literacy education should be widely carried out to eliminate illiteracy among existing workers within three years. On this basis, spare-time elementary schools should be universally developed to improve the cultural level of workers. These efforts should also pay attention to quality, for example, requiring the recognition of two thousand characters and the ability to read popular books and newspapers, and mastering simple arithmetic, before one can be considered to have escaped illiteracy. These two tasks fall within the scope of popular education. Spare-time schools at the secondary level or above, including spare-time middle schools, spare-time secondary vocational schools, and spare-time colleges, aim to cultivate intermediate and advanced scientific and technical talents, management cadres, and secondary school teachers. They should adopt the working policy of "actively developing, striving for regularity, and improving quality," and have relatively strict requirements for quality. Neither the above-mentioned popularization nor improvement aspects should be neglected; they should be well integrated.

    In order to implement the above-mentioned working policy of on-the-job vocational education, it is necessary to overcome the current right-leaning conservative thinking in on-the-job vocational education. The main manifestations of this right-leaning conservative thinking are that it only sees the difficulties in practical work, does not see or underestimates the favorable conditions, and doubts the possibility of vigorously developing regular on-the-job vocational education from elementary to university. Educational administrative departments even regard on-the-job vocational education as dispensable. Some grassroots cadres in factories and mines and trade unions often juxtapose on-the-job vocational education with the completion of production tasks, believing that on-the-job vocational education is insignificant. These ideas have become the main obstacles to the progress of current on-the-job vocational education.

    Only by helping the working class master science and technology can we smoothly build our great motherland into an industrialized socialist power. Due to the rapid speed, large scale, new technology of China's industrialization, and the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the increasing urgency of technological reform, the state requires improving the cultural and technical level of workers and cultivating construction talents through spare-time education. The vast number of workers also urgently demand to learn culture, politics, and science and technology, and to improve their cultural level, political awareness, and scientific and technical level. Except for a few leading core members who can be transferred to secondary vocational schools and colleges for further studies, the vast majority of workers can only study in their spare time because it is difficult for them to leave production and enter ordinary schools. Therefore, we must quickly and resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, vigorously develop regular on-the-job vocational education from elementary to university, so that our working class can get rid of the backward state of low cultural and technical level as soon as possible, so that the growth of our technical force can catch up with the rapid development of industrial production, and so that the leading core members of worker and peasant origin can quickly master the science and technology of modern industrial production and enterprise management skills.

    The problems in on-the-job vocational education should be solved systematically. In addition to issues such as the school system, curriculum, teaching materials, and teaching methods, which mainly rely on government education departments to solve, and funding which should be jointly stipulated by government education, finance departments, and trade unions, there are two other issues that need to be addressed with the assistance of all relevant parties: First, ensure the time for on-the-job vocational learning. Specifically, it is necessary to ensure six hours of class per week for literacy and spare-time elementary schools; eight hours of class per week for spare-time junior high schools; at least 12 hours of class per week for spare-time senior high schools, spare-time secondary vocational schools, and night school departments of spare-time colleges, and a certain amount of self-study time; and 16 to 20 hours of self-study time per week for correspondence students of colleges. When students of spare-time secondary schools and spare-time colleges take semester, annual, graduation, or national examinations in accordance with the teaching plan, they should be given necessary leave, and wages should be paid as usual during the leave. At present, the number of people participating in spare-time secondary vocational schools and spare-time colleges is very small, and as long as arrangements are made properly, the learning time of these people can be guaranteed. This requires not only the provisions of government decrees, but also a series of ideological education and organizational work. In order to ensure the spare-time learning time of workers, it is necessary to vigorously streamline meetings and social activities, and to solve the difficulties in residence, transportation, and meals for workers participating in spare-time learning, especially those participating in spare-time secondary vocational schools and spare-time colleges as much as possible, and to help them reasonably allocate their personal spare-time learning time. Second, equip all levels of on-the-job vocational schools with a certain number of full-time teachers and a large number of part-time teachers. Full-time teachers are mainly trained by government education departments and are equipped according to the workload and the ratio of teachers to students, and are included in the national plan; part-time teachers should be mobilized as much as possible from factory and mine workers and engineering and technical personnel, especially to invite them to serve as teachers of professional courses directly related to their own work. Facts have proved that as long as they are guaranteed a certain amount of preparation time and are able to engage in teaching activities for a long time and accumulate teaching experience, they can be competent for teaching work, and they can enrich teaching content and improve teaching effectiveness based on practical work experience.

    The key to further developing on-the-job vocational education is to strengthen the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels in this work. Enterprise party committees must effectively lead and organize this work politically and ideologically. Local party committees, especially the industrial and cultural and educational departments of the party committees, should systematically inspect, help, and guide this work. Government education departments should, in accordance with the central government's policy, make comprehensive plans for on-the-job vocational education in the next 12 years, and should formulate development plans for 1956 and 1957. Different requirements should be put forward according to different objects, and clear regulations should be made on what and how various cadres and workers should learn. In particular, the learning of worker and peasant cadres who are in leading positions but have low cultural and technical levels and lack professional knowledge should be planned from a long-term perspective and arranged in a coordinated manner. We must train them to become leading core members in socialist construction who manage enterprises, improve technology, and increase production.

    开展正规的职工业余教育
    开展正规的职工业余教育，举办从小学到大学的各级业余学校，是提高广大职工文化技术水平和培养国家建设人才的有效办法。
    根据中央关于全面规划、加强领导的方针和又快、又多、又好、又省的原则，在职工业余教育系统中的扫除文盲班和业余小学，应该采取“大量发展、注意质量”的工作方针，广泛开展识字教育，在三年当中扫除现有职工当中的文盲。并且在这一基础上，普遍发展业余小学，提高职工的文化水平。这些工作，也应该注意质量，例如要求认识二千个字，并且能够阅读通俗书报，学会浅易的算术，才算脱离文盲状态。这两项工作，都是属于普及教育范围之内的。中等以上的业余学校，包括业余中学、业余中等专业学校和业余高等学校，目的在于培养中级和高级的科学技术人才、管理干部以及中等学校师资，应该采取“积极发展，力求正规，提高质量”的工作方针，对质量应该有比较严格的要求。上述普及和提高这两个方面，不能偏废，应该很好地结合起来。
    为了贯彻执行上述的职工业余教育工作方针，必须克服目前在职工业余教育工作中的右倾保守思想。这种右倾保守思想的主要表现，是只看到实际工作中的困难，没有看到或是低估了有利条件，怀疑大力开展从小学到大学的正规职工业余教育的可能性。教育行政部门甚至把职工业余教育看得可有可无。有些厂矿企业和工会的基层干部，往往把职工业余教育和完成生产任务对立起来，以为职工业余教育无足轻重。这些思想已成为目前职工业余教育工作前进中的主要障碍。
    只有帮助工人阶级掌握科学技术，才能顺利地把我们伟大的祖国建设成为一个工业化的社会主义强国。由于我国工业化速度快、规模大、技术新和农业合作化高潮的到来及技术改革的日益迫切，国家要求通过业余教育来提高职工文化技术水平和培养建设人才，广大职工也迫切要求学习文化、政治和科学技术，提高文化程度、政治觉悟和科学技术水平。职工中除了少数领导骨干可以抽调到中等专业学校和高等学校进行深造以外，绝大多数的职工因为很难脱离生产进入普通学校学习，只能利用业余时间进行学习。因此，必须迅速地坚决地克服右倾保守思想，大力开展从小学到大学的正规职工业余教育，使我国工人阶级尽快地摆脱文化技术水平很低的落后状态，使我国技术力量的成长能够赶上工业生产迅速发展的要求，使我国工农出身的领导骨干很快地掌握近代工业生产的科学技术和企业经营管理的本领。
    职工业余教育中的问题应该系统地解决。除了学制、课程、教材、教学方法等问题，主要依靠政府教育部门来解决，经费要靠政府教育、财政部门和工会共同规定以外，还有两个问题需要各有关方面来协助解决：第一，要保证职工业余学习的时间。具体地说，就是要保证扫除文盲和业余小学每周上课六小时；业余初中每周保证上课八小时，业余高中、业余中等专业学校和业余高等学校夜校部每周至少上课12小时，并且要有一定的自修时间，高等学校函授生，每周自习时间16至20小时。业余中等学校和业余高等学校的学员，依照教学计划的规定进行学期、学年、毕业或国家考试的时候，都应该给予必要的假期，假期的工资照发。现时参加业余中等专业学校和业余高等学校学习的人，数量很少，只要好好安排，这些人的学习时间是可以保证的。这不仅要依靠政府法令的规定，而且要进行一系列的思想教育和组织工作。为了保证职工的业余学习时间，要大力精简会议和社会活动，要尽可能地解决参加业余学习特别是参加业余中等专业学校和业余高等学校学习的职工的居住、交通、伙食等方面的困难，帮助他们合理地支配个人的业余学习时间。第二，要给各级职工业余学校配备一定数量的专任教师和大量的兼任教师。专任教师主要地是由政府教育部门培养，依照教学工作量和师生编制比例来配备，并且列入国家计划；兼任教师要尽可能地动员厂矿的职工及工程技术人员来担任，特别是要请他们兼任同本身业务直接有关的专业课的教学。事实证明，只要保证他们有一定的备课时间，并且使他们能够长期从事教学活动，积累教学经验，他们就可以胜任教学工作，就可以根据实际工作经验来丰富教学内容，提高教学效果。
    进一步开展职工业余教育工作的关键，是加强各级党委和政府对这一工作的领导。企业党委必须从政治上、思想上切实领导和组织这项工作。地方党委尤其是党委的工业部和文教部要系统地检查、帮助、指导这一工作。政府的教育部门要按照中央的方针，对今后12年内职工业余教育作出全面规划，并且要制定1956、1957两年的事业发展计划。按照不同对象提出不同要求，对于各类干部和工人学什么和如何学的问题，要作出明确的规定。特别是对于担任领导工作而文化技术水平较低和缺乏专业知识的工农干部的学习，要从长期着眼，统筹安排，一定要培养他们成为社会主义建设中管理企业、改进技术、提高生产的领导骨干。
