Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

For the past few days, I have listened to Premier Zhou's political report, Vice Chairman Li's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman Guo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the upsurge of the socialist revolution, Vice Chairman Chen's report on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, President Dong's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries, and Vice Premier Chen's report on the National Agricultural Development Program Outline from 1956 to 1967, and I feel extremely encouraged! And I wholeheartedly support them! Now, I will briefly describe my impressions of attending this meeting as a non-voting delegate and the direction of my future efforts:

First of all, our socialist camp is becoming increasingly stronger, because as Chairman Mao has declared, our cause is a just cause, deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of the world, so-called "the righteous get more support." Conversely, the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism is committing many injustices and is doomed to destruction, so-called "the unrighteous find scant support; at the height of their unpopularity, even their close followers turn against them." Therefore, the growing socialist camp is capable of preventing the war adventures of the aggressive bloc. If the aggressive bloc dares to launch a third world war, then, as Premier Zhou revealed, it will be not just one or another imperialist country that fails, but the entire imperialist system. Therefore, the current international situation is very favorable to us, and we can vigorously carry out our socialist construction and transformation.

Secondly, what is extremely exciting is that, since liberation, all construction endeavors in our motherland have been advancing by leaps and bounds, at a speed that is truly unprecedented. Looking at the high tide of our agricultural cooperativization, it is truly like ten thousand horses galloping, overturning mountains and seas. Taking Anhui as an example, according to the report I heard on January 19th, the province has already completed 87%, and of course, it is more than this number now. As for the high tide of the socialist transformation of handicrafts and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, it is surging along, with gongs and drums filling the air everywhere, joyfully reporting the good news, reaching every corner of the country.

As long as our intellectuals compare the new China with the old China, and the new social system with the old social system, they can immediately see the unprecedented achievements of the new China and immediately see the superiority of the socialist system. Then, our love for the Party, for Chairman Mao, and for the motherland will flourish spontaneously, inevitably, and sincerely.

We must take practical actions to love the Party, the leader, and the motherland. That is to say, we must contribute all our strength and serve the socialist cause in our respective positions. As agricultural educators, we must firmly study Marxism-Leninism, rigorously criticize the remaining bourgeois ideology, do a good job in teaching, teaching methodology, and teacher training, in order to cultivate a sufficient number of well-rounded construction cadres for the socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperativization of our country. As forestry scientists, under the leadership of the Party, we must continuously learn from the Soviet Union, continuously study diligently, and continuously encourage ourselves to strive to reach the world's forestry science level within 12 years, in regard to certain gaps in forest science. We must squeeze out more time to help each other and learn from each other with young forestry scientists, so as to achieve improvement in both political and professional studies. What is even more gratifying is to know that our country will be completely greened in 12 years, and Anhui will be greened in 7 years. We must identify fast-growing tree species with economic value according to the suitability of each region, and provide them to the business departments for reference. We must help nearby agricultural cooperatives do a good job in seedling cultivation, afforestation, and forest protection. We must discover the special tree species of various regions and propagate and promote them, such as the *Mubuzi* and *Sassafras tzumu* of southern Anhui, the variant or new species of pine trees, and the *Quercus variabilis* and *Quercus suber* of northern Anhui, in order to achieve, in the process of greening, that on the one hand, we can supply timber for industrialization, and on the other hand, we can improve the climate, conserve water and soil, and ensure stable and high agricultural production. That is to say, forestry serves agriculture, which is also what Williams taught us, the significance of forestry in agriculture. In short, it is possible to achieve the greening of the whole country in 12 years and the greening of the whole province of Anhui in 7 years. Firstly, because of the correct leadership of the Party, secondly, because of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and thirdly, because of the foundation of agricultural cooperativization. I think that as long as we are willing to work hard, we will definitely be able to complete it on schedule.

The above are my impressions of attending this meeting and the direction of my future efforts planned in great excitement. I hope that the committee members and comrades will point out any errors.

    齐坚如的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    几天来，我倾听了周总理的政治报告、李副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告、郭副主席的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告、陈副主席的关于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的报告、董院长的关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告、以及陈副总理的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要报告等之后，我感到非常地振奋！并且竭诚地拥护！我现在把我列席这一次会议的感想，和今后努力的方向简述于后：
    首先是我们社会主义的阵营日益强大，因为诚如毛主席所昭示，我们的事业是正义的事业，深得全世界人民之心的，所谓得道者多助。相反地，是以美帝为首的侵略集团，它们是多行不义，必自毙，所谓失道者寡助，寡助之至，属从畔之。所以日益壮大的社会主义阵营，是能制止侵略集团的战争冒险的。万一侵略集团敢于发动第三次世界大战，那么，诚如周总理所揭示，失败的，将不仅是这一个或那一个帝国主义国家，而是整个帝国主义体系。因此，现在国际的局势，是非常有利于我们的，我们正可大力地搞我们的社会主义建设和改造事业。
    其次令人万分兴奋的，是我们祖国，在解放后，所有的建设事业都是猛飞突进，这种速度，真是空前所没有的。再看我们的农业合作化的高潮，真是如万马奔腾，排山倒海而来。就拿安徽来说，根据我于1月19日所听到的报告，全省已经完成了87％，当然现在还不止此数。至于手工业的社会主义改造和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮，亦澎湃与之俱来，到处锣鼓喧天，狂欢的报喜，达到全国的任何一个角落。
    我们知识分子只要拿新旧中国相比，新旧社会制度相比，马上就可以看出新中国的空前成就，马上就可以看出社会主义制度的优越性。那么，我们热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱祖国的心，就蓬发而生，这是不期然而然的，这是出于至诚的。
    我们要拿实际行动，来热爱党、领袖和祖国。那就是说，我们要贡献出我们所有的力量，各就工作岗位，来为社会主义事业服务。作为农业教育工作者，我们一定要抓紧地学习马克思列宁主义，严格地批判残存的资产阶级思想，搞好教学工作，教学法工作，师资培养工作，来为祖国社会主义工业化和农业合作化培养足够数量的全面发展的建设干部。作为林业科学工作者，我们要在党的领导下，对于森林科学上的某些空白，不断地学习苏联，不断地钻研，不断地策励，争取在12年内，能够达到世界森林科学的水平。我们要多挤出一些时间，来与青年林业科学工作者，互相帮助，互相学习，以期彼此在政治和业务学习上达到提高。更足令我们高兴的，是知道我们祖国在12年内，我们安徽在7年内要全部的绿化，我们一定要各就地区之所宜，找出有经济价值的速生树种，提供业务部门作参考；我们要帮助附近的农业合作社，做好育苗和造林、护林的工作；我们要发掘出各地区的特用的树种，而加以繁殖和推广，如皖南的木?、檫树、变种或新种的松树和皖北的樌木、栓皮栎等，以期在绿化中，达到一方面能供应工业化的用材，另一方面能改良气候，保持水土，保证农业上的稳定和高额的生产。这就是说，林业为农业服务，也就是威廉士所教导我们的，林业在农业上的意义。总之，我们全国12年，我们安徽全省7年绿化，是可以办到的。一因有党的正确领导，二因有苏联先进的经验，三因有农业合作化的基础。我想只要我们肯努力，是一定可以按期完成的。
    以上是我列席这次会议的感想和在万分振奋中所拟的今后努力的方向，尚望各位委员和各位同志加以指正。
