Do Not Lightly Change the Business Methods of Small Urban Businesses
    Wen Ying
    According to the instructions of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Second and Third Commercial Bureaus of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee held a meeting of state-owned and joint state-private commercial cadres on February 1st. The meeting mobilized the staff of all joint state-private stores in the city to actively improve business operations and ensure good supply work. At the meeting, Vice Mayor Li Gengtao gave a report, in which he spoke about the new atmosphere after the establishment of joint state-private enterprises. He also pointed out some undesirable phenomena that had arisen in the operation of some stores and called on the staff of joint state-private stores to improve their operations and put forward specific methods for improvement. He particularly pointed out that for the numerous and scattered small businesses, the method of consignment sales should generally be adopted after the implementation of joint state-private ownership, so as to give full play to their enthusiasm for business. He also demanded that they change the abnormal phenomena such as shortening business hours and reducing the variety of goods operated in the shortest possible time to better meet the needs of consumers.
    After the full implementation of joint state-private ownership of small businesses in Tianjin, the business enthusiasm of some businesses has increased, and their turnover has increased significantly. However, during this period, the excessive and inappropriate changes to the old management system of small businesses also reduced the enthusiasm of some small businesses, shortened their business hours, and reduced the variety of goods they handled.
    Before the implementation of joint state-private ownership, most small businesses in Tianjin did not have formal accounts. They often sold goods directly from the counter after they were received, and took money from the counter when they needed it. They called this method "pocket accounting." This time, after being approved for joint state-private ownership, small businesses, like large stores, established a reporting system. Moreover, the report forms prescribed by some specialized companies were too complicated, which brought great difficulties to small businesses. For example, the accounting system for the coal industry is particularly complex. From the time raw materials are taken to the time coal balls are made, five forms must be filled out: purchase order, receipt account, screening coal lump processing change type form, change type income form, and coal ball processing change type form. These forms are not only impossible for small stores to fill out, but also difficult for large stores with sound accounts in the past to fill out well. Only three of the 128 coal merchants in Nankai District knew how to fill them out; some households settled their accounts until 2 a.m. every night; and some households could not read, making accounting even more difficult. In the past, customers who bought several commodities in hardware stores only needed one invoice. After the joint venture, each commodity had to have its own invoice. A record also had to be made on a card. Some industries also stipulated that accounts had to be reported to the joint state-private district general store once a day or every three to five days, which made some small stores busy with accounting, calculation, and reporting every day, greatly reducing their operating hours. Xinlicheng Store in the cultural and educational supplies industry in Chengxiang District closed two hours earlier because it had to sort out sales cards. In the past, cotton thread was sold in small skeins, but now one had to buy a large skein, because it was difficult to keep accounts and report them in small skeins. Many small stores were afraid that settling accounts would be too troublesome, so they were unwilling to sell more goods and increase the variety of goods, which could not facilitate the needs of consumers.
    Some small businesses originally had purchase and credit sales relationships with some second-tier wholesalers and handicraft production cooperatives, and could purchase some small commodities that state-owned commercial departments had not yet mastered. Moreover, these small commodities were often urgently needed and happily used by the masses. However, after the joint venture, they did not retain these purchase relationships, which greatly reduced the variety of goods they handled. The small commodities sold by small businesses in the Xiaobaolou area, such as thimbles, wool, buttons, shoe mouth strips, and shoelaces, were freely purchased or purchased on credit by small businesses from the Houjiahou Handicraft and General Merchandise Market in the past. After the joint venture, their commodities were mainly supplied by state-owned commercial departments, and they no longer purchased goods; in addition, with the implementation of cooperation in handicrafts, the supply relationship was broken. There were originally 18 businesses in Tianjin engaged in the purchase and wholesale of dried fruits, purchasing some commodities that were rarely or not operated by state-owned companies in other places, such as Jinan persimmon cakes, Yidu Yuan jujubes, hawthorns, sour jujubes, and hawthorn slices, for small businesses to operate, which were also very popular with consumers. After the joint venture, 16 households had to wait for instructions from their superiors before deciding whether to go to other places to purchase goods. Now only two households are still purchasing goods in other places. When the stock is sold out, the new goods are cut off, and it is clear that supply problems will occur.
    The complicated procedures for state-owned commercial departments to purchase goods take small businesses a day and a half to purchase goods at a time, which affects their operations. For example, if Zhenji Leather Shoe Store buys leather from the Animal Products Company, it must first go to the sales department of the Animal Products Company to get a slip, take the slip to the warehouse to see the goods, and after the goods are approved, the warehouse issues a slip, then go back to the sales department to mark the price, then go to the Shoe and Hat General Store to open a check, pay the money at the sales department of the Animal Products Company after opening the check, and then go to the warehouse to pick up the goods, and then send the invoice to the general store for reimbursement. It takes a day to purchase goods in this way, which naturally affects the operation. Some small businesses do not open until noon because the purchase time is too long. They said: There is no one at home, so they don't open the door to purchase goods. This makes it impossible for customers to buy goods.
    In the past, small businesses did not have a fixed income, and they often had to decide based on the quality of their business. After the joint venture, Tianjin adopted the method of borrowing living expenses for the wages of small businesses in some industries, and also gave subsidies to households with financial difficulties. This, on the one hand, played a certain role in stabilizing the lives of small businessmen, but the disadvantage of this practice is that it cannot give play to the business enthusiasm of small businesses. On the contrary, many small business owners have developed the idea of "sitting and waiting for a salary" and "eating from the big pot," and are not responsible for the profits and losses of the enterprise. For example, Li Zhenzhu, the manager of Deqishun Guozidian, started frying Guozidian for sale at 7 o'clock before the joint venture, but now he does not open the door to start a fire until 8 o'clock. In the past, he had to sell 25 jin of flour every day, but now he can't sell 15 jin of flour. Department stores such as Yuanxinghe and Wanfeng near the East Railway Station used to open to sell goods in the middle of the night, but now they close when the time comes. The business hours of Yanji Coal Shop were once the same as the office hours of the agency, and the service attitude was very bad. Local customers called him "three no-gos": he would not go to deliver coal far away, he would not go to customers living upstairs, and the old (the manager was older) would not go. They said: "Anyway, I get a monthly salary whether I work or not" and "Business is good or bad has nothing to do with me." Some small businesses only do two or three yuan of business a day, but they receive two or three yuan in living expenses. This, on the one hand, affects the enthusiasm of small businesses, and at the same time, it also causes no one to be responsible for the enterprise, causing losses to state wealth, and more importantly, it cannot facilitate the needs of the masses.
    The above-mentioned problems in the operation and management of small businesses in Tianjin after the joint state-private venture are mainly due to the fact that the relevant commercial leading departments have not educated the staff of the joint state-private commercial departments, and have not clearly pointed out that the original management system, purchasing, sales methods, and accounting system of the enterprise should be temporarily retained and should not be easily changed. In particular, the transformation of small businesses should be carried out more cautiously. Therefore, some state-owned specialized companies attempted to turn small businesses into retail departments of socialist commerce at once, and turn small businessmen into workers who receive monthly wages, which would inevitably lead to chaos in management and affect supply work.
    The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attached importance to this issue and took effective measures in a timely manner, which will have a decisive effect on quickly reversing the current abnormal phenomena in supply work. However, when changing the current business methods of small businesses, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and patient ideological education work to make them realize the necessity of changing the current business methods, and to realize that the operation and management of joint state-private stores must be subordinate to facilitating and meeting the needs of consumers. The staff of joint state-private enterprises must better serve the lives of the masses. It is necessary to prevent confusion during the transition process.

    不要轻易变动城市小商的经营方式
    闻莹
    根据中共天津市委的指示，天津市人民委员会第二、第三商业局在2月1日举行国营商业和公私合营商业干部会议，动员全市公私合营商店的职工，积极搞好业务经营，保证作好供应工作。会上，李耕涛副市长作了报告，他讲到公私合营后的新气象，也提出了有些商店经营上产生一些不好的现象，号召公私合营商店的工作人员必须改进经营并提出了改进的具体办法。他特别指出对为数众多、分散的小商户，在实行公私合营后，一般应采取代销的办法，以便充分发挥他们的经营积极性，并要求他们在最短期内改变目前业务中缩短营业时间、减少经营品种等不正常的现象，更好地满足消费者需要。
    天津市的小商户在全部实行公私合营后，有一部分商户的经营积极性提高，营业额有了显著增加。但是在这一时期内，由于过多地不适当地改变了小商户的旧有的经营制度，也使一些小商户的经营积极性降低，经营时间缩短，经营品种减少。
    在实行公私合营之前，天津市一般小商户都没有正规的账目，常常是进了货在柜上卖，要花钱就在柜上拿，他们都把这种办法叫做“口袋账”。这次在被批准公私合营后，小商户和大商店一样建立了报账制度，而且有的专业公司规定的报表太复杂，给小商户带来了极大的困难。如煤炭业的会计制度特别复杂，从取原料到打成煤球要填五种表：进货通知单、收货账、过筛煤块加工变类表、变类收入表、打制煤球加工变类表。这些表报不但小商店没法填写，就是过去账目健全的大商店也很难填得好。南开区128户煤商，只有三个人会填；有的户每夜结账到深夜2点钟；有的户不认识字，记账就更困难。过去顾客到五金商店买几种商品只开一张发票，合营后每买一种商品就得开一张发票。还要在卡片上记上一笔账。有的行业还规定一天或三、五天就要向公私合营区总店报一次账，这样就使一些小商店天天忙于计账、算账、报账，大大减少了他们的经营时间。城厢区文教用品业的新立成商店，因为要整理销货卡片，就提前两小时关门。过去卖棉线都是分成小缕卖，现在要买就得买一大绞，因为分成小缕一不好记账、二不好报账。很多小商店怕结账太麻烦不愿意多卖货、不愿意多增加品种，这样就不能便利消费者的需要。
    有些小商户，原来同一些二批发商、手工业生产合作社间有进货和赊销关系，可以采购一些国营商业部门目前还没有掌握的小商品，而且这些小商品常常是群众所迫切需要和乐于使用的。但是在合营以后，他们就没有把这些进货关系保留下来，使经营品种大大减少了。在小白楼一带小商户出售的小百货顶针、绒线、扣子、鞋口条、鞋带等商品，过去是小商户到侯家后手工业百货市场去自由选购或赊购的。合营后他们的商品主要由国营商业部门供应，不再去进货；加上手工业实行合作化，供应关系就断了。天津市原来有18户经营干果采购批发的商户，在外埠采购一些国营公司少经营或不经营的商品，如济南柿饼、益都元枣、红果、酸枣、山楂片等，供应小商户经营，也很受消费者欢迎。合营后有16户要等上级指示后再决定是否到外地去进货，现在只有两户还在外地采购，存货卖光了，新货断了，眼看供应就会发生问题。
    国营商业部门进货手续的繁复，使小商户进一次货就要占去一天半天功夫，影响经营。如振记皮鞋庄到畜产公司买一次皮子，就要先到畜产公司门市部开条子，拿了条子到仓库看货，看妥后由仓库开条子，再回门市部去划价，再到鞋帽总商店开支票，开了支票再去畜产公司门市部交款，然后才到仓库去取货，取货后还要把发票送到总店报账。这样进一次货要化费一天功夫，自然就会影响经营。有些小商户因为进货时间太长，到中午才开门。他们说：家里没有人，进货不开门。这样就使顾客买不到货。
    过去，小商户没有固定的收入，常常要看经营情况的好坏来决定。合营后天津市对有些行业小商户的工资是采用借支生活费用的办法，对生活困难户还给补助费用。这一方面对稳定小商人的生活起了一定的作用，但是这种做法的缺点就是不能发挥小商户的经营积极性，反使很多小业主产生了“坐等发薪”“吃大锅饭”的思想，对企业盈亏不负责任。如德起顺餜子铺的经理李振柱，合营前7点钟就开始炸餜子卖，合营后8点钟才开门生火。过去每天要卖25斤面粉，现在15斤面粉还卖不掉。东车站附近的源兴合、万丰等百货店过去半夜也开门卖货，现在到时就关门。阎记煤铺的营业时间，曾经有一度和机关的办公时间一样，而且服务态度很坏，当地顾客都管他叫“三不去”：送煤路远的不去、住在楼上的顾客不去、老的（经理年纪大些）不去。他们说：“反正干不干拿月钱”“买卖好坏和我无关”。有的小商户一天只做二、三元买卖，领生活费用倒领了二、三元。这样做一方面影响了小商户的积极性，同时也造成了企业无人负责，使国家财富受到损失，更主要的是不能便利群众的需要。
    天津市小商户在公私合营后在经营管理上发生上述问题，主要是由于有关商业领导部门没有对公私合营商业部门的工作人员进行教育，没有明确地指出对企业原有的管理制度、进货、销货办法、会计制度都应当暂时保留下来，不应该轻易的变动。特别是对小商户的改造工作，更应该慎重从事。因而使有些国营专业公司企图一下子把小商户变为社会主义商业的门市部，把小商人成为按月领取工资的工作人员，这就必然会造成经营上的混乱，影响供应工作。
      中共天津市委重视了这一问题，及时地采取了有效的措施，这对迅速扭转目前供应工作中的不正常现象将有决定性的作用。但是在改变目前小商户的经营方式的时候，必须进行细致而耐心的思想教育工作，使他们认识到改变目前经营方式的必要性，认识到公私合营商店的经营管理，必须服从于便利和满足消费者的需要。公私合营企业的工作人员，必须更好地为群众生活服务。要防止在转变过程中发生混乱现象。
