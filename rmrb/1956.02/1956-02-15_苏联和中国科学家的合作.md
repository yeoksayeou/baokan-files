    Cooperation Between Soviet and Chinese Scientists
    Professor Novikov, Deputy Scientific Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
    The Soviet people are watching with great pleasure and admiration the historic achievements made by the great Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong in the cause of socialist industrialization, agriculture, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
    Soviet scientists highly value and respect Chinese science, which has a history of many centuries. The compass, which allows navigators to confidently steer ships; paper, which we use to write and print books; the printing of books, from which we can draw knowledge; seismographs, which can warn us of earthquakes; the principles of rocket activity, which people will use in the near future to fly to other planets in the solar system—humanity owes all of this to Chinese science.
    Chinese science has now entered a new and important stage of development. There is no doubt that this will be a period of prosperity for Chinese science, thanks to the special care of the Chinese Communist Party for the development of science.
    Soviet scientific and technological assistance and the friendship between Soviet and Chinese scientists will promote the prosperity of Chinese science.
    The release and practical utilization of atomic energy is a great and noble undertaking for the benefit of mankind. In the few years since the methods of releasing and practically utilizing the energy of the atomic nucleus were discovered, atomic energy has formed a new and rich department of science and technology and has become a powerful factor in developing productive forces.
    The Soviet Union selflessly assists many countries in establishing the scientific and technological foundations for research into the peaceful use of atomic energy, so that each of these countries can further develop the work of peaceful use of atomic energy smoothly and independently. The Soviet Union is building an atomic reactor with a heat output of 6,500 to 10,000 kilowatts for scientists in the People's Republic of China. With this reactor, Chinese physicists, chemists, biologists, metallurgists, and other scientists will be able to carry out many important research and experiments and will be able to make many outstanding inventions.
    In the Soviet Union, a cyclotron is also being built for Chinese physicists to give particles an energy of 12.5 million to 25 million electron volts.
    Soviet scientists exchange experiences and knowledge with their brothers—Chinese scientists—in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, for the cause of benefiting the people.
    The increasingly consolidated friendly cooperation between Soviet and Chinese scientists is the best guarantee of our common success.
    Soviet scientists warmly wish their Chinese friends and all the Chinese people achievements in socialist construction.

    苏联和中国科学家的合作
    苏联科学院副科学秘书长　诺维科夫教授
    苏联人民怀着极大的愉快和赞美的心情注视着在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的伟大的中国人民在社会主义工业化、农业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造事业中所获得的历史性成就。
    苏联科学家给予具有许多世纪历史的中国科学以高度的评价和尊敬。指南针，航海家借助于它可以很有把握地驾驶轮船；纸张，我们用它来写字和印刷书籍；书籍的印刷，我们可以从书籍中汲取到知识；地震仪，它可以把地震预告给我们；火箭活动的原理，人们借助于这个原理，在不久的将来就要飞往太阳系的其他行星——所有这些，人类都应该感谢中国的科学。
    中国科学现在已经进入新的重要的发展阶段。毫无疑问，由于中国共产党对科学的发展特别关怀，这将是中国科学的繁荣时期。
    苏联的科学技术援助和苏中科学家的友谊，将会促进中国科学的繁荣。
    原子能的释放和实际的利用，对于增进人类福利是一桩伟大而崇高的事业。在释放和实际利用原子核的能量的方法被发现以来的不多年间，原子能形成了一个崭新的、丰富的科学和技术部门，并成为发展生产力的有力因素。
    苏联无私地援助许多国家建立发展和平利用原子能方面的研究的科学技术基础，以使这些国家中的每一个国家都能进一步顺利和独立地发展和平利用原子能的工作。苏联正在为中华人民共和国的科学家建立一座发热量为6，500到10，000瓩的原子反应堆。用这个反应堆，中国的物理学家、化学家、生物学家、冶金学家和其他的科学家将有可能进行许多重要的研究和实验，并将能作出不少卓越的发明。
    在苏联还正为中国的物理学家建立一个使粒子获得1，250万到2，500万电子伏特的能量用的回旋加速器。
    苏联的科学家同自己的弟兄——中国的科学家交换原子能用于和平的目的、用于造福人民的事业的经验和知识。
    苏联科学家和中国科学家的友好合作的日益巩固是我们共同成功的最好保证。
    苏联的科学家热诚地祝自己的中国朋友和中国全体人民在社会主义建设中获得成就。
