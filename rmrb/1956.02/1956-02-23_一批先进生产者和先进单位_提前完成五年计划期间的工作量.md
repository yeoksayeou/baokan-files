    A Batch of Advanced Producers and Advanced Units
    Complete Five-Year Plan Workload Ahead of Schedule
    This newspaper reports: A batch of advanced producers and advanced units from the Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant, Qijiang Auto Parts Factory, and Chongqing Machine Tool Plant have completed their workload for the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    Workers in the Ma Hengchang group at the Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant had already completed all of their work for the first Five-Year Plan by late January of this year. Over the past few years, this group has diligently studied and promoted six kinds of advanced Soviet experience in production, such as high-speed cutting, the Unanov universal lathe tool method, and the Kolesov lathe tool method, as well as four kinds of advanced Soviet operating methods such as the dial indicator, increasing production efficiency by 50% to 1300%. Upholding the spirit of collectivism, the group solved many key technical problems such as the spring collet, not only consistently overfulfilling state plans but also improving product quality.
    In February, driller Jia Gui from the mechanical workshop, turner You Yuxi from the rolling stock workshop, and the Dong Baoshan group from the freight car workshop at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory had already begun working on their 1958 workload. In this factory, 64 workers are already working on their 1957 workload. At the factory's recent second representative conference of advanced producers and rationalization proposal makers, another 422 advanced workers proposed an initiative to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and launch an advanced producer movement. This initiative received the support of all factory employees.
    In Chongqing, nine young workers have completed their individual workload for the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Among these nine advanced workers are outstanding young milling machine operator Liao Shigang, who has completed seven years and four months of work in the past two years. There is also Leng Jinming, an outstanding young planer operator at the Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant who has successively improved 39 types of jigs, fixtures, cutting tools, and machining methods since 1953, increasing production efficiency by 100% to 1200%, as well as He Qinyou, a young turner at the Qijiang Auto Parts Factory who completed six years and two and a half months of work in three years, and others.
