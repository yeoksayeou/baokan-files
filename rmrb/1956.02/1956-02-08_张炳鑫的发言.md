    Zhang Bingxin's Speech

    Chairman, Esteemed Committee Members, Comrades:

    I am Zhang Bingxin, director of the processed drug workshop at the jointly owned state-private Tongrentang Processed Drug Factory. Before the joint ownership, I was an ordinary worker. In the past, I wouldn't have dreamed of being invited to attend such an important meeting. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party could I have such an honor. Seeing our most respected and greatest leader Chairman Mao at the meeting makes my heart want to leap with joy. Such honor and joy are all gained under the Party's cultivation and education.

    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of the leading comrades, and I am greatly moved by the speeches of the committee members. I myself am engaged in the work of processing traditional Chinese medicine, which is also part of medical and health work. I would like to share my personal feelings. Traditional Chinese medicine has thousands of years of history. Ancient prescriptions for prepared medicines existed as early as before the Common Era. In ancient times, medical scientists fought against prevalent diseases and left behind a portion of prepared medicine formulas. It can be said that medicine and pharmacy were inseparable in the past. Therefore, the combination of medicine and pharmacy is indispensable in comprehensive planning.

    In the old society, traditional Chinese medicine could not be promoted and was discriminated against and undermined by the reactionary government. It was difficult even to make a living, let alone conduct academic research. After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine underwent a fundamental change. The Party also made the unity and cooperation of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine an important policy. Here, I think that traditional Chinese medicine should also be integrated because medicine and pharmacy used to be combined.

    In the upsurge of socialist construction, inheriting and carrying forward the cause of traditional Chinese medicine also serves the construction of socialism. At present, according to the National Agricultural Development Program, the work of traditional Chinese medicine should also be comprehensively planned. The current equipment for processing traditional Chinese medicine should be improved, and machine production should replace manual operation. Mutual research between medicine and pharmacy should be strengthened, and more new medicines for treating diseases should be discovered and unified formulas should be created to facilitate the clinical application of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Senior medical experts should write more books on traditional Chinese medicine pharmaceutics to standardize drug processing and improve drug potency and efficacy. Chemical testing institutions should also be established in traditional Chinese medicine factories to test the quality of medicines. In addition, the state should strengthen the purchase of medicinal materials and process them locally, which can increase farmers' income and reduce transportation costs. The above are some of my requests to the government and experts. As for my personal work attitude, I will definitely bring back the instructions of the central leaders and the spirit of the conference resolutions to my work post. On the basis of ensuring quality and quantity, I will promote the mechanization and scientification of traditional Chinese medicine processing, learn from the processing of new drugs, and produce more and better cheap medicines to protect the people's health and contribute to the early completion of our country's socialist construction.

    Finally, I wish the conference a complete success.

    And I wish the Chairman and all committee members good health!

    张炳鑫的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我是公私合营同仁堂炙药厂炙药车间主任，在合营前是一个普通工人。我今天应邀列席这样重大的会，过去是不用想到的，只有共产党的领导，我才能有这样的光荣。在会上并且见到了我们最敬爱、最伟大的领袖毛主席，使我高兴的心都要蹦出来。这样的光荣和高兴都是在党的培养和教育下得到的。
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和各位首长的报告，并且听到了各位委员的发言，使我受到很大的感动。我本身做的是个中药炙造工作，也是医药卫生的一部分，就我个人的感觉谈一谈。祖国的医药有数千年的历史，其中成药方剂早在公元以前，所以在古代的医学家与流行疾病作斗争当中，便遗留下一部分成药的配方，也可以说过去医药是不分家的，所以在全面规划当中医药的结合更是不可缺少的。
    在旧社会里，中医中药是提不起来的，遭到反动政府的歧视和摧残，不用说是学术的研究，就连糊口都有些困难。解放后，在中国共产党的领导下，对待中医中药有了本质上的不同，党又把中西医团结合作列为重要的一项政策，在这里，我想中药也要结合上去才行，因为过去医药是结合的。
    在社会主义建设的高潮当中，继承和发扬祖国的医药事业，也是为建设社会主义而服务。目前根据全国农业发展纲要，在中医中药的工作也要全面的规划。要提高现在中药炙造的设备，以机器生产代替手工操作。要加强医药互相研究工作，对于新的疾病治疗用药的多多发现，统一配方，以便于中西药的临床应用。高级医药界专家要多著中药的药剂学，使炙药方面统一，更能使药力提高疗效。在中药药厂方面也要设立化验机构，以检验药品的好坏。另外在药材生产经销上要加强国家收购，就地加工，一方面可以使农民增加收入，一方面可以减少运输的成本。以上我所谈的是对政府及专家们的一些要求。我个人的工作态度，一定要把中央首长的指示及大会的决议精神带回工作岗位上去，要在保质保量的基础上，使中药在炙药方面走向机器化科学化，向新药炙造方面看齐，炙造出更多更好价廉的药品来保障人民的身体健康，为我们国家的社会主义建设更能提早的完成而努力。
    最后预祝大会胜利成功。
    并祝主席及各位委员身体健康！
