Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, 6th: Chinese student Liu Yongming, accompanied by his wife Gui Qionghua, arrived in Shenzhen from Hong Kong at 3:58 PM today. Liu Yongming's daughter, Meimei, leaned on him and happily exclaimed, "We're back! My Daddy is back!"

Liu Yongming's younger brother, Liu Yongchang, followed closely behind, walking alongside Ji Feng, a representative of the Chinese Red Cross. Liu Yongchang had specially flown from Beijing to welcome his elder brother back to the country.

Upon arriving in Shenzhen, Ji Feng said to Liu Yongming, "You can breathe a sigh of relief now; these are all our own people." The returned student sighed deeply and said, "I am very grateful to you. Thank you for everyone's efforts." He warmly shook hands with all the people who came to welcome him and then went to a guest house here to rest.

Liu Yongming was detained in a mental hospital in the United States for six years before finally being released at the beginning of last month. But he still faced strong pressure from the American side to force him to abandon his desire to return to his country.

His wife, Gui Qionghua, said: "As soon as I saw him, I knew everything would go smoothly. I told him that the government had made great efforts to get him released from the mental hospital. He said he was very grateful to the government and told me that he had always wanted to come back to serve the motherland. But he didn't dare to express this desire publicly in the past because the Americans had constantly threatened him that if he returned to China he would be shot." Gui Qionghua continued: "I am very happy that he finally came back. But after this ordeal, he needs very good care."

She said that she hoped the news that Liu Yongming was finally able to return to his country would encourage other Chinese students in the United States to strive to return to the motherland.

After arriving in Shenzhen, Dr. Liu Yongchang told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "When my brother went to the United States, he was a healthy and intelligent student. Now, when he returns, his body and mind have been destroyed by years of torment and the terror of these past few weeks.

"As a doctor, I have already recorded the terrible experiences my brother suffered in the United States and on his journey back home. On the journey from the United States to Hong Kong, secret agents along the way tormented him. These deliberately created, external pressures are an extremely dangerous and damaging thing for the nerves of my brother, who has been imprisoned in a mental hospital for several years."

At 10 PM last night, Liu Yongming formally requested Hong Kong's Social Welfare Department official, Alexander, to allow him to leave the refugee camp. Half an hour later, he was allowed to leave the refugee camp and live with his wife, daughter, and younger brother, who had specially come to Hong Kong to take care of him.

This morning, they applied to Wilcocks, the head of the Political Department of the Hong Kong government, to leave the territory and go to Guangzhou. Wilcocks replied that they were free to leave and issued a guarantee from the Hong Kong authorities for their safety. At 12:15 PM, accompanied by Ji Feng, the representative of the Chinese Red Cross, they left Hong Kong and arrived at Luohu, south of Shenzhen, at 12:50 PM.

It was at this point that they were obstructed by McCreton, an immigration official of the Hong Kong government, who insisted on talking to Liu Yongming alone. Liu Yongming immediately became flustered, fearful, and confused again. McCreton claimed that Liu Yongming had not personally expressed to him his desire to return to his country and drove them all back to the British police station in Tai Po Hui, Kowloon. Although Liu Yongming was already extremely nervous at this time, he was still interrogated at the police station until McCreton finally agreed to let him leave.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th: Chinese student Liu Yongming left the Hong Kong refugee camp at 22:30 on the 5th and is living with his wife, daughter, younger brother, and others.

At 15:30 on the 5th, Liu Yongming's younger brother, Liu Yongchang, and Liu Yongming's daughter, Meimei, along with Mr. Stracy, a representative of the Hong Kong branch of the British Red Cross, met with Liu Yongming at the North Point refugee camp.

As soon as Liu Yongming saw his younger brother Yongchang, whom he had been separated from for many years, he held his hand tightly and asked him about everything. Liu Yongming expressed his deep concern when he asked about the recent situation of his younger brother and every relative who was working and living happily in the country. Liu Yongming gently stroked Meimei's hair and said, "You've grown taller in the few years I haven't seen you!" He gave Meimei a fresh orange and said, "Share some with Mommy!" The lively and innocent Liu Meimei held her father's hand and refused to let go. She said, "Daddy, I want you to go back to Guangzhou with Mommy and me, back to our home!" Liu Yongming said earnestly, "I will definitely take you and your Mommy back to Guangzhou together." After meeting his brother, Liu Yongchang told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "My brother was very affectionate when he saw us, as if he had a lot of things he wanted to tell us. He wanted me to see him every day, saying that he had many things to talk to me about slowly, and he asked me to take him out to get some fresh air."

Liu Yongchang added: "Liu Yongming has obviously been subjected to long-term torture and intimidation by the American authorities. When we were talking about family matters, he seemed a little panicked, and his eyes were constantly watching the people outside the door. He also told me in a low voice not to let the people outside hear what we were saying, because talking nonsense would get you killed."

Liu Yongchang said that when he asked Liu Yongming about the situation in the United States, Liu Yongming became even more frightened. Liu Yongming said: "In America, I lived in a hospital, but it was not a hospital, it was a fortress, it was hell, it was very terrifying. They are Hitler, they are Mussolini..."

Liu Yongchang said: "Originally, we had many family matters to talk about, but at around 4 PM, the personnel guarding the refugee camp said it was getting late and told us to leave quickly. When I was talking to my brother, there was an unidentified person outside the door, specifically monitoring us."

Liu Yongchang finally said very excitedly: "Liu Yongming has suffered a lot of mental pain, we must bring him home to reunite with us."

At 19:30, Liu Yongchang accompanied Liu Yongming's wife, Gui Qionghua, and others to the refugee camp again to visit Liu Yongming. At this time, Liu Yongming happily agreed to come out and reunite with his wife. Liu Yongchang and Gui Qionghua, according to Liu Yongming's wishes, negotiated with the Hong Kong British government's Social Welfare Department, and Liu Yongming formally expressed to Alexander, the person in charge of the Social Welfare Department, his desire to leave the refugee camp and reunite with his beloved wife Gui Qionghua, daughter Meimei, and younger brother Yongchang. At 22:30, Liu Yongming was granted permission by Alexander to leave the refugee camp.

    留美学生刘永铭回到祖国怀抱
    新华社深圳6日电　我国留美学生刘永铭在妻子桂琼华陪伴下在今天下午3时58分从香港到达深圳。刘永铭的女儿美美倚着他，高兴地叫起来，“我们回来了。我的爸爸回来了。”
    刘永铭的弟弟刘永錩在后面紧跟着，他和中国红十字会代表纪锋走在一起。刘永錩是特地从北京乘飞机赶来迎接他哥哥回国的。
    他们抵达深圳之后，纪锋就对刘永铭说：“你现在可以松口气了，这里都是自己人了。”这位归国的留学生深深地叹了口气说：“我很感谢你。感谢你们大家的努力。”他和所有欢迎的人们热烈握手，然后到这里的一所招待所去休息。
    刘永铭在美国的一所神经病院被扣留了6年之后才在上月初被释放出来。但仍旧受到美国方面为了要迫使他放弃回国的愿望而施加的强大压力。
    他的妻子桂琼华说：“我一见到他，我就知道一切都会顺利的。我对他说政府费了很大力气才使他得以从神经病院里被释放出来。他说他很感激政府，并且告诉我说他一直就想回来为祖国服务。但是他过去不敢公开表示这种愿望，因为美国人曾经不断地威吓他说如果他回到中国来他就会被枪毙。”桂琼华接着说：“我很高兴他到底回来了。不过经过这一番熬煎之后，他需要很好的照料。”
    她说，她希望刘永铭终于得以回国的消息，会鼓励其他留美学生，争取返回祖国。
    到达深圳之后，刘永錩大夫对新华社记者说：“我的哥哥去美国的时候，是一个身体健康的、聪明的学生。现在他回来的时候，他的身心已经被几年来的折磨和这几星期以来的恐怖毁坏了。
    “作为一个大夫，我已经把我的哥哥在美国和在回国旅途上所受到的可怕经历记录下来。从美国到香港的旅途上，沿途都有特务折磨他，这些蓄意制造的、外来的压力，对于几年来被禁锢在神经病院中的我的哥哥的神经是一种极危险的毁伤。”
    昨天晚上10点钟，刘永铭正式要求香港社会局官员亚力山大准许他离开难民营。半小时以后，他被准许离开难民营，和特地到香港照料他的妻子、女儿和弟弟住在一起。
    今天上午，他们向香港政府政治部主任维尔科斯申请离境，前往广州。维尔科斯回答说，他们可以自由离去，并且签发由香港当局保护他们的安全。中午12时15分，他们在中国红十字会代表纪锋的陪同下离开了香港，在12时50分抵达深圳以南的罗湖。
    就在这个地方他们受到香港政府移民局官员麦克里顿的阻难，他坚持要和刘永铭单独谈话。刘永铭立刻又慌张、恐惧、混乱起来，麦克里顿声称刘永铭并没有亲自向他表示自己要回祖国去，并且把他们都赶回到九龙大浦墟的英警署。虽然刘永铭这时神经上已经极度紧张，他在警署仍然受到盘问直到麦克里顿最后同意他离开为止。
    新华社香港6日电　中国留美学生刘永铭已经在5日22时30分离开香港难民营，和他的妻子、女儿及弟弟等一起居住。
    在5日15时30分，刘永铭的弟弟刘永錩和刘永铭的女儿美美会同英国红十字会香港分会的代表斯特拉西到北角难民营，会见了刘永铭。
    刘永铭一见到离别多年的弟弟永錩，就紧紧地握住他的手，向他问长问短。刘永铭问到在国内工作、生活得很愉快的弟弟和每一个亲属的近况时，表示殷切地关怀。刘永铭轻轻地抚摸着美美的头发说：“不见你几年，你长高了！”他拿了一个新鲜的桔子给美美说：“分点给妈妈吃啊！”活泼天真的刘美美拉着她的爸爸的手不肯放，她说：“爸爸，我要您跟我妈妈一起回广州去，回到我们的家里！”刘永铭认真地说：“我一定和你的妈妈带你一起回广州。”刘永錩会见他哥哥以后，对新华社驻香港记者说：“我哥哥见到我们时很亲切，像有很多心里的话要倾吐，他要我天天去看他，说有许多东西和我慢慢谈，并且要求我带他出来吸吸空气。”
    刘永錩又说：“刘永铭显然是受到美国当局长期的折磨和恫吓的。我们在谈家常时，他显得有点惊慌，眼睛经常注意房门外的人。他还低声告我，说话不要让外边的人听到，乱说话会杀头的。”
    刘永錩说，当他问起刘永铭在美国的情况时，刘永铭更加惊悸。刘永铭说：“在美国住的是病院，但也不是病院，是堡垒，是地狱，很恐怖。他们是希特勒，是墨索里尼……”。
    刘永錩说：“本来我们有许多家事要谈的，但是到了下午4时多，看守难民营的人员就说时间晚了，叫我们赶快离开。在我和哥哥谈话的时候，房门外有一个身份不明的人，特地监视着我们。”
    刘永錩最后很激动的说：“刘永铭在精神上受了很多痛苦，我们一定要把他接回家里团聚。”
    19时30分，刘永錩陪同刘永铭的妻子桂琼华等人再到难民营去看望刘永铭，这时候，刘永铭很高兴地同意出来和妻子团聚。刘永錩和桂琼华按照刘永铭的意愿就和香港英国政府社会局交涉，刘永铭并在社会局负责人亚力山大面前正式表示要离开难民营和爱妻桂琼华、女儿美美和弟弟永錩等一起团聚。到22时30分，刘永铭得到亚力山大的允许，离开难民营。
