    Anshan Iron and Steel's Primary Rolling Mill Should Overcome Departmentalism
    By Our Correspondent Yuan Liang
    On December 4, 1955, the large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was rolling bridge angle steel for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site. At 1:30 AM, the rolling mill suddenly stopped running. The workers, standing idle by the machines, anxiously awaited the Primary Rolling Mill to send over the materials.
    According to the work plan, the bridge steel billets should have been delivered long ago. The dispatchers repeatedly urged the Primary Rolling Mill, but the Primary Rolling Mill repeatedly disappointed the workers of the large rolling mill, causing them to lose more than 20 work hours consecutively, which is an unusual number, equivalent to more than 1,000 tons of steel!
    It turned out that departmentalism was at play.
    Before 24:00 on December 3rd, the Primary Rolling Mill requested steel ingots from the steelmaking plant. The steelmaking plant sent three low-temperature steel ingots. Because reheating cold ingots affects production, and the Primary Rolling Mill has a system of "heating hot ingots, not cold ingots," the Class B dispatcher, Zhang Shimin, and the dispatch foreman, Liu Baode, did not accept this batch of cold ingots. After 24:00, the Class C dispatcher was also unwilling to accept them, saying, "If the previous shift didn't heat them, why should we?"
    At 4 AM, when the Primary Rolling Mill needed to charge the furnace, they requested hot ingots from the steelmaking plant again. The steelmaking plant's dispatcher, Hao Zhanyu, and ingot-making shift foreman, Wang Fushun, considered their regulations: delivering steel by the ladle and furnace. If the Primary Rolling Mill did not accept the cold ingots that had already been sent—which they had requested—they would be classified as "dropped" ingots. If an ingot was dropped, they would have to go through troublesome handling procedures; otherwise, they could not be counted as fulfilling their task. So, their response to the Primary Rolling Mill was, "If you don't accept the cold ingots—which you asked for—we won't send you hot ingots!"
    It's not hard to imagine that if either side's shift personnel had slightly considered the overall interest, thinking about the serious situation of the large rolling mill being stopped for lack of materials, and were willing to suffer a small loss themselves by transferring the three cold ingots to their side, or even as a compromise, treating it as a pending issue to be dealt with later and first sending the already produced bridge steel to charge the furnace, the large rolling mill would not have suffered this loss.
    Unexpectedly, they heartlessly allowed the situation to remain deadlocked.
    By 8:30 AM on the 4th, the new shift brought new tricks. The bridge steel placed in the ground pit had changed from red to purple, and then from purple to black. Neither side mentioned it anymore.
    The clock pointed to 11 AM, and the large rolling mill was still stopped for lack of materials. The large rolling mill reported the situation to the dispatch office of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's production department (hereinafter referred to as the Company Dispatch Office). Wang Taiyuan, the dispatcher of the Company Dispatch Office, called the Primary Rolling Mill's dispatch office:
    "The large rolling mill has been waiting for materials for a long time; you should charge the furnace quickly."
    "The steel ingots are already cold; we have to wait for hot ones—aren't the steelmaking plant's No. 3 and 4 open-hearth furnaces scheduled to produce bridge steel three at 14:00? Heating those hot ones will be faster than heating the cold ones now," replied Qi Yougui, the Primary Rolling Mill's dispatcher.
    "What if the hot ingots don't come? It's safer to charge the cold ingots first."
    "Alright!" Although Qi Yougui agreed, he was actually still making calculations: the output would certainly be higher with hot ingots.
    An hour or so later, the Company Dispatch Office inquired again. At this time, Qi Yougui was at lunch, and the call was answered by a recorder surnamed Tian, who said, "The steel ingots haven't arrived yet." But the steelmaking plant's dispatcher insisted that they had already been transported over. After this back-and-forth, another 30 minutes passed. The Company Dispatch Office immediately instructed the steelmaking plant's dispatcher to investigate. The result of the investigation was: the steel ingots were still in the steelmaking plant's ground pit. This was clearly the steelmaking plant's dispatcher stalling. How could dispatch workers tell lies?
    The Company Dispatch Office was not at ease and at 13:00, they urged the Primary Rolling Mill to charge the furnace again. At this time, dispatcher Qi Yougui said, "Alright! Let me discuss it with the factory director." Qi Yougui had to ask his factory director for approval before executing the order from the Company's production department. No wonder things were delayed again and again! Qi Yougui reported his own opinion and the Company Dispatch Office's opinion to their deputy factory director, Chen Xuquan. Deputy Director Chen told him, "Then follow the Company's production department's opinion!"
    Another hour passed. The bridge steel three that the steelmaking plant was scheduled to produce was revealed to be something else—the steel grade had changed. It was not bridge steel three, but another grade of steel. Trying to rely on hot ingots was no longer possible. It was also at this time that the Primary Rolling Mill began charging cold ingots (still those two ladles of bridge steel three) into furnace number eight. The Primary Rolling Mill finally "compromised"!
    Unfortunately, there were too many people in the Primary Rolling Mill's staff with the poison of departmentalism in their minds. Shift dispatch director Jiang Ying (in charge of charging and discharging the furnace), seeing that there were hot ingots in the preheating furnace, disregarded the "first come, first served" principle, "dispatcher's decision," "factory director's approval," "large factory waiting," and "Company's instructions," and decided to remove the three cold ingots that had already been loaded into the furnace and replace them with other hot ingots. Bridge steel cannot speak; if it could, it would not tolerate such "favoritism"! But the people with mouths did not sympathize with it. There was no concern from the dispatcher, nor from the factory directors. The production dispatch section of the Company's production department also failed to diligently inspect, resolutely fight against, or promptly report to the leadership to find a solution. When reporters interviewed them, they all said that they did not know about these situations at the time. But the factory directors and dispatchers cannot say they did not know that the large rolling mill urgently needed bridge steel three and had been waiting for a long time! Thus, the Primary Rolling Mill delayed the loading of bridge steel three into the preheating furnace until 17:20 in the afternoon, and it was not delivered to the large rolling mill until 5:00 AM on the 5th.
    It is very clear that the loss to the large rolling mill is a loss to the country. There is no need to elaborate on this. We should investigate the root cause of this incident!
    The occurrence of this incident is not accidental. For the Primary Rolling Mill, this is just one of countless similar incidents. The factory director also admitted that the departmentalist thinking of the Primary Rolling Mill is quite serious in other matters. For example, they only see the shortcomings of the steelmaking plant, only know how to strictly demand from the steelmaking plant, but do not see the needs of the various rolling mills, and rarely strictly demand from themselves; they often only seek their own convenience. Their system of "heating hot ingots, not cold ingots" is correct in terms of the production of the same grade of steel, but it is wrong if they unilaterally emphasize this system without following the product plan. The factory director has always adopted a tacit, supportive attitude towards this tendency to unilaterally implement the system, which is the root cause of the incident.

    鞍钢初轧厂应该克服本位主义
    本报记者　袁良
    1955年12月4日，鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂正在为武汉长江大桥工地轧制桥梁角钢。夜里一点半钟，轧钢机突然停止运转了。守在机器旁边无事可作的工人们，焦急地期待着初轧厂赶快送料来。
    按照作业计划，桥梁钢坯子早就该送过来了。调度人员一次又一次地催促初轧厂，初轧厂却一次又一次地让大型轧钢厂的工人们失望，使他们连续失掉20多个工时，这是不平常的数字，它等於1，000多吨钢材哩！
    原来是本位主义在作祟。
    12月3日24点钟以前，初轧厂向炼钢厂要钢锭。炼钢厂送来了三块温度低的钢锭。因为烧冷锭影响产量，同时初轧厂又有“有热锭不烧冷锭”的制度，所以，乙班调度员张世民和调度工长刘宝德没有接收这批冷锭。24点以后，丙班调度员也不愿接收，他说：“上班不烧，我们为什么烧呢？”
    到了夜里4时，初轧厂需要装炉的时候，又向炼钢厂要热锭。炼钢厂的调度员郝占余、造块值班工长王福顺所考虑的是他们的制度：按罐按炉送钢。已经送去的冷锭如果初轧厂不接收，就要编入“掉队”钢锭，钢锭掉队了，还要履行麻烦的处理手续，不然，就不能算作完成任务。所以他们给初轧厂的回答是：“要是你们不接收冷锭——这是你们提出来要的——我们就不送热锭！”
    不难想像，假定有一方值班人员稍为考虑整体利益，想到大型轧钢厂停工待料的严重情况，自己肯吃一点小亏，把这三块冷锭吊过自己这边来；或者退一步说把它当作悬案放到以后再去处理，先把已经出炉的桥梁钢送去装炉，大型轧钢厂哪里还会遭到这个损失呢？
    真想不到，他们竟然忍心轻轻松松地让事情继续僵下去。
    到了4日早晨8点30分钟，新的一班又带来了新的花样。放在地坑里的桥梁钢已经由红变紫，又由紫变黑了。双方面谁也不再提起它。
    时针指向了11点，大型轧钢厂还在停工待料。大型轧钢厂把情况反映到鞍山钢铁公司生产处调度室（下称公司调度室）。公司调度室调度员王泰源给初轧厂调度室去了电话：
    “大型轧钢厂待料时间已经很长了，你们应该赶快装炉。”
    “现在钢锭已经冷了，我们得等着装热的——炼钢厂的三、四号平炉不是预定14点出桥梁钢三吗？那时烧热的比现在烧冷的还要来得快些。”初轧厂调度员齐有贵回答。
    “如果热锭来不了怎么办？还是先装冷锭保险些。”
    “好吧！”齐有贵虽然答应了，但是他实际上还在那里打着小算盘：装热锭产量当然要高些。
    过了个把钟头，公司调度室又询问了一次。这时齐有贵吃中饭去了，接电话的是一个姓田的记录员，记录员说“钢锭还没有来。”但是炼钢厂调度员硬说已经运过来了。这样一来一往又过了30分钟。公司调度室即责成炼钢厂调度员进行检查。检查的结果是：钢锭仍然放在炼钢厂的地坑里。这显然是炼钢厂的调度员在搪塞了。调度工作者怎能说假话呢？
    公司调度室不放心，13点，又去督促初轧厂装炉。这时候，调度员齐有贵才说：“那好吧！让我和厂长研究研究。”公司生产处的命令，齐有贵却还要请示他的厂长批准才肯执行哩，难怪事情这样一拖再拖！齐有贵把他自己的意见和公司调度室的意见一并报告给他们的副厂长陈绪权。陈副厂长告诉他：“那还是服从公司生产处的意见吧！”
    时间又消逝了一个钟头。炼钢厂预定要出的桥梁钢三已经揭晓——钢种改变了。它不是桥梁钢三，而是别的钢种。再想在热锭上打主意是不行了。初轧厂也正在这个时候才开始往八号炉里装冷锭（还是那两罐桥梁钢三）。初轧厂总算“委曲求全”啦！
    可惜，初轧厂的工作人员中，脑子里装有本位主义毒素的人太多了些。值班调度长蒋英（掌握装炉、出炉工作），看到预热炉里有了热锭，便不顾什么“先来后到”、“调度员决定”、“厂长批准”、“大型厂待料”、“公司指示”这一系列的问题，竟然决定把已经装到炉子里的三块冷锭又夹了出来，换进了别的热锭。桥梁钢是不会说话的，它要是会说话，那肯忍受这种“偏待”？可是长着嘴的人们不同情它。这里没有看到调度员的关怀，也没有看到厂长们的关怀。而公司生产处生产调度科也没有做到勤於检查，坚决斗争或及时报请领导上设法解决。当记者访问他们的时候，他们都说当时他们不知道这些情况。可是厂长们和调度员们不能说不知道大型轧钢厂急需桥梁钢三而且已经待料很长时间的事啊！就这样，初轧厂将桥梁钢三装入预热炉的时间已经拖到下午17点20分钟，等到送到大型轧钢厂去已经是5日早晨5点钟了。
    事情很明显，大型轧钢厂的损失就是国家的损失。这一层用不着多讲。我们应该追查事情发生的根源！
    这件事情的发生，并不是偶然的。对初轧厂来说，这仅是无数次同类事件中的一次。厂长也承认：在别的事情上，表现出初轧厂的本位主义思想是相当严重的。比如他们只看到炼钢厂的缺点，只知道严格要求炼钢厂，而看不到各个轧钢厂的需要，也很少严格要求自己，他们往往只图自己的方便。他们“有热锭不烧冷锭”的制度，用在同一钢种生产方面是对的，但如果不按照品种计划片面地强调这个制度就不对了。厂长对这种片面执行制度的倾向，一直采取默认、支持的态度，这就是事件发生的总根源。
