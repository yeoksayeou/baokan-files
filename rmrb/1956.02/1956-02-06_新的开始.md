A New Beginning
Zhang Qian

Opening this year's January provincial and municipal newspapers, the first thing one notices is that the vast majority have adopted horizontal typesetting and increased the number of pictures to a certain extent. This makes the newspaper layout more lively and welcomed by readers. The January 25th Beijing Daily published 5 photos. Except for "Chairman Mao Zedong Receives Chairman Ton Duc Thang," which was a Xinhua News Agency release, the other 4 were taken by the newspaper itself: two reported on workers completing their production plans ahead of schedule, and two reported on male and female athletes practicing racing before the farmers' sports meeting. There were also 4 cartoons, 3 of which criticized the conservative thinking of enterprise staff and the old style of athletes, and another which satirized Dulles' "brink of war" clamor.

A more important change is that the articles and news in these newspapers are much shorter than before, thus increasing the number of pieces and enriching the content. In the past, each editorial was always three or four thousand words long, but now they are generally around two thousand words, and some are only four or five hundred words, so two editorials can be published in one issue. In the past, articles and communications were very long, some seven or eight thousand words, or even ten thousand words, and often only a few such large articles could be published on one page. Now, articles and communications are only one or two thousand words or several hundred words, and a page can publish ten, twenty articles, news items, and communications.

Another significant change in these newspapers is the increase in commentary, and the ability to comment on major issues in the current work in a timely manner. Shandong Dazhong Daily published 25 editorials in the first half of January, in addition to reprinting those from the People's Daily. Most of these editorials are closely linked to current needs, with small titles and prominent centers. For example, in an editorial titled "What Huang County and Wendeng Prefecture Can Do, Other Regions Should Also Be Able to Do," the newspaper used concise facts and irrefutable reasoning to illustrate that the potential in agricultural production is infinite, and that increased production will not reach a ceiling; Huang County and Wendeng Prefecture can still increase grain production significantly, and other regions should also have the confidence to increase production. "Starting with the Fact that a District Party Committee Secretary's Family Has Not Joined the Cooperative" is another militant editorial. Based on the situation that some party members have resistance to agricultural cooperativization, it puts forward the problem of conscientiously doing ideological education for party members. This also shows that as long as the newspaper editorial department actively works hard, overcomes difficulties, the problem of strengthening commentary work can be solved.

In communications reporting, there have also been many improvements. That is, the number of communications reflecting new people and new events has increased. In a news item titled "They Entered 1956 Ahead of Schedule," Beijing Workers' Daily reported that more than 2,000 advanced workers from seven locomotive and rolling stock repair factories in Qishuyan, Shijiazhuang, and other places, through various efforts, were already doing the work of 1956 last year, and many people have also stepped into 1958. From the news, we can see that among these advanced workers, many people are not only good themselves, but also help everyone to be good together; some workers who were originally behind have also caught up and are doing the work of 1956 ahead of schedule. News, communications and short features that promote advanced figures and advanced experiences like this also frequently appear in other newspapers. From these reports, people are encouraged and see that hundreds of thousands of advanced workers are striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

Some newspapers also pay attention to reflecting the new aspects of social life. Shanghai Jiefang Daily reported on the changes in two candy stores. In the past, the capitalists of these two candy stores, in order to grab business and seize profits, each hung signs with "Heaven Knows" and turtles carved on them at their doors to brag about themselves and insult the other party. Recently, after the two candy stores became joint state-private enterprises, both parties voluntarily took down and smashed several signs that had been hanging for three or forty years. A short communication in Jiangsu Xinhua Daily reported that the farmers in Ronghe Township, Yancheng County, had been looking forward to a road leading to Qinnan Town for many years, but they never had the strength to build it. Recently, 85% of the farmers in this township joined the cooperative, and they smoothly solved the problems of roadbed and labor, and a flat road called "Direction Road" by everyone was quickly built. Jiangxi Daily published a short communication titled "Criticism," reporting that an old agricultural cooperative member changed his past erroneous behavior of "having self but no cooperative" after being criticized at a unity and mutual aid meeting for new and old cooperative members. Such reports not only reflect the new atmosphere of the new countryside, but also help people change their old perceptions of farmers.

This new beginning is precious. However, some newspapers also exposed more serious shortcomings, mainly the one-sided pursuit of formal aesthetics. For example, on pages 2 and 3 of the January 18th Jilin Daily, two paintings with similar content were published, one of which used more than four thousand words of space. The two paintings, plus the extra-large banner headlines around the page, took up more than four-tenths of the two pages. We cannot, on the one hand, ask the correspondents to write articles shorter, but arbitrarily waste space ourselves. In order to make the newspaper better meet the needs of the broad masses, we should cherish and promote every new improvement in newspaper work, and pay attention to correcting the bad practice of one-sided pursuit of form.

### 新的开始

    新的开始
    张浅
    翻开今年一月份的省市以上报纸，首先看到的是，绝大多数实行了横排，并且增加了一定数量的图片。这样，报纸的版面就生动活泼，为读者所欢迎。1月25日的北京日报，登出了5张照片。除了“毛泽东主席接见孙德胜委员长”一张是新华社稿外，另外4张都是报纸自己拍摄的；两张报道工人提前完成生产计划，两张报道农民运动大会前男女运动员练习赛跑的情形。另外有4幅漫画，3幅是批评企业工作人员的保守思想和运动员的旧作风的，另一幅是讽刺杜勒斯的“战争边缘”的叫嚣的。
   更重要的一个变化是，这些报纸上的文章和新闻都比以前短小得多，因而篇数增多，内容丰富了。过去每篇社论总是三、四千字，现在一般的两千字左右，还有的只有四、五百字，一期就可以登两篇社论。过去的文章、通讯都很长，有的七、八千字，甚至万把字，一个版上常常只能登几篇这样的大文章。现在的文章、通讯只有一、二千字或几百字，一个版上能登十几二十篇文章、新闻和通讯。
    在这些报纸上还有个显著的变化，就是评论增加了，而且对当前工作中的重大问题能够及时加以评论。山东大众日报在1月上半月的14期报纸上，除了转载人民日报的以外，发表了25篇社论。这些社论大多数都能紧密结合当前的需要，题目小而中心突出。例如，在一篇“黄县和文登专区办得到，各地区也应当办得到”的社论里，报纸用简练的事实和无可辩驳的道理，说明了农业生产中的潜力是无限的，增产是不会到顶的；黄县和文登专区还可以增产大量的粮食，其他地区也应该有增产的把握。“从一个区委书记家庭不入社谈起”是另一篇具有战斗性的社论。它根据有的党员对农业合作化存在抵触思想的情况，提出了切实做好对党员的思想教育工作的问题。这也说明只要报纸编辑部积极努力，克服困难，加强评论工作的问题是可以解决的。
    在通讯报道上，也有不少的改进。这就是，反映新人新事的通讯增加了。北京工人日报在一篇“他们提前走进了1956年”的消息里，报道了戚墅堰、石家庄等地七个机车车辆修理工厂的二千多名先进工人，经过种种努力，去年已经在做1956年的工作，有不少人还迈进了1958年。从消息里可以看到，在这些先进工人中，许多人不但自己好，还帮助大家一起好；有些原来落在后面的工人，也赶上来提前做着1956年的工作。像这样宣传先进人物和先进经验的新闻、通讯和短小的特写，在其他报纸上也经常出现。从这些报道里，人们受到了鼓舞，看到了成千上万的先进工作者，正在为提早完成五年计划而奋斗。
    还有些报纸注意反映社会生活中的新面貌。上海解放日报报道了两家糖果店的变化，过去这两家糖果店的资本家，为了抢生意夺利润，各在自己门口挂了“天晓得”和刻有乌龟的招牌吹嘘自己，辱骂对方。最近这两家糖果店公私合营后，双方自动把一直挂了三、四十年的几块招牌摘下来敲碎了。江苏新华日报的一篇小通讯报道说：盐城县融和乡的农民，多少年来都盼望有一条通到秦南镇的大路，可是总是没有力量去修筑。最近这个乡85％的农民参加了合作社，就顺利地解决了路基、劳力等问题，一条被大家叫做“方向路”的平坦大路，便很快修了起来。江西日报登出了一篇题目叫做“批评”的短通讯，报道了一个老农业社员在新老社员团结友爱互助会上受到批评后，改变了过去“有己无社”的错误行为。这样的报道不只是反映了新农村的新气象，而且能帮助人们改变对农民的旧的看法。
    这种新的开始是宝贵的。但是，有些报纸也暴露了较严重的缺点，主要是片面地追求形式上的美观。例如吉林日报在1月18日的二、三版上，登出了两幅内容差不多的画，其中有一幅画用了四千多字的地位。两幅画加上版面四周特别大的通栏标题的装饰，约占去了两个版十分之四还多的篇幅。我们不能够一方面要求通讯员把文章写得短些，自己却把篇幅任意浪费。为了使报纸更能满足广大群众的需要，我们应当珍视和发扬报纸工作中每一个新的改进，并且注意纠正片面追求形式的不良作风。
