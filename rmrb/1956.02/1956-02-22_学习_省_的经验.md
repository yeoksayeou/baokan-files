    Learning from the Experience of "Saving"
    The advanced experience of prefabricated concrete radiators emerged just after the All-Soviet Union Conference of Construction Workers held in the Soviet Union last year. The Design Office of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau promptly studied and adopted this new technological achievement and, with great perseverance, repeatedly experimented with it, and now it has been successful.
    According to calculations, replacing cast iron radiators with prefabricated concrete radiators can reduce the cost of building's plumbing and heating engineering by 30%, while also saving the country a large amount of metal. If all civil buildings in Shenyang City adopt this method this year, at least 1,700 to 2,000 tons of iron can be saved.
    Chairman Mao called on us to carry out socialist construction with more, faster, better, and more economical results. However, some people are now only enthusiastic about "more" and "faster," while neglecting "better" and "economical." They forget that if we don't "economize," it will reduce capital accumulation and affect our construction from being "more" and "faster." The designers of the Design Office of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau attach great importance to the issue of "saving" and pay attention to timely learning and adopting the experience of "saving," which is worthy of everyone's learning.

    学习“省”的经验
    预制混凝土放热器的先进经验是苏联去年召开全苏建筑工作人员会议之后刚刚出现的。沈阳市建筑工程局设计处及时学习采用了这项新的技术成就，并以很大的毅力来反复试验，现在已经成功了。
    据计算，以预制混凝土放热器代替铸铁暖气片，可以使建筑物的水暖工程造价降低30％，同时还可给国家节约大量金属，如果今年全沈阳市的民用建筑都采用这个办法，至少可以节约1，700到2，000吨铁。
    毛主席号召我们要又多、又快、又好、又省地进行社会主义建设。但是，现在有些人只热中于“多”和“快”，而忽略了“好”和“省”，他们忘记了，如果不“省”，就会减少资金积累，就会影响到我们的建设不能更“多”，更“快”。沈阳市建筑工程局设计处的设计人员十分重视“省”的问题，注意及时学习采用“省”的经验，值得大家学习。
