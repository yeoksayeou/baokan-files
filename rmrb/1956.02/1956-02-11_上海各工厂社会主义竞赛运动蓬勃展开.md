Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 10th: A socialist emulation campaign to strive for the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan is vigorously unfolding on Shanghai's industrial production front.

The First Ministry of Machine Building's factories in Shanghai were the earliest to mobilize. Before the end of last year, 3 factories, including the State-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory, had proposed guarantees to complete the cumulative figures for the total output value and main product output of the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. Six workers, including Sheng Li, a lathe operator from the State-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, had completed more than two years of work ahead of schedule. In January of this year, 6 factories initiated or participated in nationwide inter-factory competitions, and 16 types of work participated in nationwide intra-trade competitions. Among them, the State-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, in the first month of participating in the inter-factory competition, achieved the competition conditions to reach the 1957 production level ahead of schedule.

The textile, steel, and light industry departments also began to mobilize in January. Up to now, 275 factories have put forward competitive targets to strive for the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan and have participated in nationwide or municipal inter-factory competitions in the same industry.

After the entire private industrial and commercial sector implemented joint state-private ownership, the socialist emulation campaign began to be fully launched in the city's industrial sectors. More than 1,000 newly jointly-owned factories, which are currently rushing to manufacture 250,000 double-wheeled single-blade plows and 12 types of agricultural machinery, have begun to organize a production competition with the goal of completing agricultural orders on schedule before spring plowing. All the newly jointly-owned textile factories have participated in inter-factory competitions, and more than 40 factories have formulated plans to catch up with the management level of state-owned factories within one or two years.

The technical and management departments in industrial enterprises have also been drawn into the emulation campaign. The design department of the State-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, the inspection department of the Shanghai Turbine Factory, and other departments have respectively proposed initiating inter-factory competitions between departments with the same business.

    上海各工厂社会主义竞赛运动蓬勃展开
    新华社上海10日电　上海工业生产战线上，争取提前完成第一个五年计划的社会主义竞赛运动蓬勃展开。
    第一机械工业部在上海的工厂发动得最早。去年年底以前，就有国营上海汽轮机厂等3个厂提出了提前一年完成五年生产总值和主要产品产量等累计数的保证；有国营上海机床厂车工盛利等6个工人提前两年多完成了5年的工作量；今年1月份，就有6个厂倡议或参加了全国性的厂际竞赛，有16个工种参加了全国性的同工种竞赛，其中国营上海机床厂在参加厂际竞赛的第一个月，就提前实现了达到1957年生产水平的竞赛条件。
    纺织、钢铁、轻工业部门在1月份也都开始发动起来了。到目前为止，已经有275个厂，分别提出了争取提前完成第一个五年计划的竞赛指标，参加了全国性的或全市性的同行业厂际竞赛。
    私营工商业行业全部实行公私合营以后，社会主义竞赛运动就开始在全市工业行业中全面地发动起来。正在突击制造25万部双轮单铧犁和12种农业机械的1，000多家新合营厂，已经开始组织在春耕前如期完成农业定货为目标的生产竞赛。新合营的纺织工厂全部参加了厂际竞赛，有40多个厂订出了在一年或两年内赶上国营厂管理水平的计划。
    工业企业中的技术和管理部门也卷入了竞赛运动。国营上海电机厂的设计科、上海汽轮机厂的检验科等科室人员分别提出了开展厂际的同业务科室之间的竞赛的倡议。
