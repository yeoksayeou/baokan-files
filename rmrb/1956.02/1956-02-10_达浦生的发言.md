    Da Pucheng's Speech
    Chairman, esteemed committee members, comrades:
    Over the past few days, we have listened to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and several important reports from several vice-chairmen and President Dong. I express my heartfelt support for the aforementioned reports.
    The convocation of this Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is of profound significance and timeliness, because just as our country is in the high tide of this great socialist revolution, within ten days or so, the capitalist industry and commerce in major cities across the country have rapidly moved towards the advanced form of state capitalism. In recent days, everywhere I hear friends talking about and see in newspapers the earth-shaking celebrations and good news. The vast cities and countryside throughout the country are moving towards socialism at the fastest speed, and everywhere they are engaged in joint public-private ownership, agricultural cooperation, and collectivization. This is truly a great happy event in the lives of our people, allowing each of us to see the stage of greater prosperity and strength and a more affluent and happy life for our people that is about to come in our country. First of all, we should thank our beloved Chairman Mao and the wise leadership of the Communist Party for this great transformation measure.
    Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the "Draft National Agricultural Development Program for 1956 to 1967," which is a document of historical significance, pointing out a happy vision for the development of national agriculture and rural construction. We in the Islamic community firmly support this great plan and far-reaching goal.
    Some friends went to various places to inspect some time ago and saw that agricultural cooperation of a semi-socialist nature has been basically realized in areas where the Hui people live in concentrated communities. In areas where the Hui and Han people live together, "Joint Hui-Han People's Cooperatives" have also been established. In the Joint Hui-Han People's Cooperatives, there are cooperative cadres composed of Hui and Han people, and cooperative rules and regulations that are conducive to unity and production have been formulated. The customs and habits of all ethnic groups in the cooperative are also fully respected. As a result, the relationship between the Hui and Han people is even closer and more united. Many Han farmers automatically help the Hui people improve technology and increase production; the Hui people can also humbly learn from the Han people.
    Among the Hui people who joined the cooperatives last year, the output generally increased compared with when they were working individually. Now these agricultural cooperative members are enthusiastically engaged in winter production and preparing for spring ploughing, striving to increase more output this year and upgrade to advanced cooperatives. These situations have greatly encouraged us and also illustrate that our great leader Chairman Mao's ethnic policy has once again achieved a glorious victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture. That is to say, with the leadership of our wise leader Chairman Mao, we Islamic people can also embark on the road of cooperation, promote greater national unity, and enable our Hui people to contribute their strength to the socialist cause.
    In short, both the socialist transformation of industry and commerce in cities and the agricultural cooperation movement in rural areas have brought great benefits to our Hui people.
    Therefore, we must respond to this great call and actively support and work hard in our respective work positions.
    We in the Islamic community should resolutely support and make a hundred times more effort to speed up the construction of a happy and perfect socialist society day and night. At the same time, we must be a hundred times more vigilant to prevent bad elements disguised in religious cloaks from hiding in the religious community and doing everything to sabotage. We must distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely take the road of cooperation in order to get rid of backwardness and poverty and embark on the road to happiness and common prosperity.
    Only in this way can our various nationalities be more united, and our country will be stronger and the country's strength will be more abundant.
    Finally, I want to say that our people of all ethnic groups should redouble our unity. According to Premier Zhou's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, we should strive to liberate Taiwan at an early date and rescue the 8 million people who are suffering under foreign military rule. We should strive to realize the complete unification of the motherland!

    达浦生的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这几天以来，我们听了周恩来主席的政治报告和几位副主席与董院长的几个重要报告，我对于上述的各种报告表示衷心拥护。
    此次政治协商会议的召开是具有深厚的意义和适时的，因为正当我们国家处在这伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中，在十数天内全国各大城市中的资本主义工商业很迅速地走向了国家资本主义的高级形式。近几天到处都听到各界朋友在谈论，和在报纸上看到的喧天震地庆祝和报喜。全国广大的城市和农村到处都以最大速度奔向社会主义，到处都在那里搞公私合营、农业合作化、集体化，这真是我们国家人民生活中的一件大喜事，使得我们每个人都看到了我们国家即将来临的更加富强、人民生活更加丰裕幸福的阶段。这一伟大的改造措施，首先我们应该感谢我们敬爱的毛主席和共产党的英明领导。
    最近中共中央提出了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案，这是一个具有历史意义的文献，给全国农业和农村建设的发展，又指出了幸福远景。我们伊斯兰教界是坚决拥护这个伟大计划和远大的目标。
    前些日子有些朋友曾到各处去视察，看到了回民聚居地区基本上实现了半社会主义性质的农业合作化，在回汉杂居地区，也办了“回汉民联合社”。在回汉民联合社里，有回汉民成份的社干部，并且制定了有利于团结生产的社章，社里各民族的风俗习惯也充分受到了尊重，由此，回汉民间的关系更加亲密团结了，许多汉族农民自动帮助回民改进技术，提高生产；回民也能虚心地向汉民学习。
    在去年入了社的回民当中，普遍地比单干时增加了产量，现在这些农业合作社社员们，正在热烈地投入了冬季生产和准备春耕的活动，争取今年增加更多的产量，和升入高级社。这些情况大大地鼓舞了我们，也说明了我们伟大领袖毛主席的民族政策，在农业社会主义改造中，又一次光辉的胜利。也就是说，我们有英明的领袖毛主席领导，我们伊斯兰教界人民也能走上合作化的道路，促使民族更加团结，使得我们回族人民也能在社会主义事业中贡献出自己的力量。
    总之，不论在城市中的工商业社会主义改造，在农村中的农业合作化运动，都给我们回族人民带来莫大的利益。
    所以，我们要响应这一伟大号召，在各个工作岗位上积极赞助与努力。
    我们伊斯兰教界应坚决拥护，并百倍地努力，加强速度，使美满的幸福的社会主义社会一日千里地建设起来。同时我们要百倍地提高警惕，谨防披着宗教的外衣的坏分子暗藏在宗教界里，做一切破坏的勾当。我们要分清敌我，听毛主席的话，坚决走合作化的道路，才能摆脱落后与贫困，才能走上幸福的共同富裕的道路上。
    只有这样，我们各民族应更加团结，我们国家才会更加强盛，国家的力量更加充沛。
    最后我要讲，我们各族人民，格外加紧团结，根据周总理提出的和平解放台湾的号召，争取早日解放台湾，解救出在外国武力统治下受苦受难的800万人民，我们应当为实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗！
