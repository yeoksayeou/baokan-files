Guangxi Discovers Paleolithic Human Fossils

    Recently, Paleolithic human fossils, including the upper jaw and the posterior part of the skull, were discovered in the Qilin Mountain cave in Helong Village, Fourth District, Laibin County, Guangxi Province. These were discovered by Professor Pei Wenzhong and others from the Guangxi Investigation Team of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    According to Professor Pei Wenzhong, the era of this human fossil stratum, judging from the presence of fossils of saber-toothed elephants and giant pandas in the accumulation, may belong to the Middle Pliocene, close to or slightly later than the era of the Zhoukoudian accumulation near Beijing containing Sinanthropus fossils. According to the preliminary observation of Professor Wu Rukang of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology, this human fossil seems to be more advanced than Sinanthropus.

    In addition, the investigation team also found a large number of higher primate fossils in the same area, of which at least 5 teeth belong to the fossils of the so-called "Gigantopithecus" or "Giant Man" discovered in the past.

    Currently, excavation work is still in progress.

    广西发现旧石器时代人类化石
    在广西省来宾县四区合隆村麒麟山山洞内最近发现了旧石器时代的人类化石，包括上颚骨和头骨后部。这是由中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室广西调查队裴文中教授等人发现的。
    这个人类化石地层的时代，据裴文中教授的意见，从堆积中有剑齿象及大猫熊化石存在看来，可能属中新世中期，和北京附近周口店含中国猿人化石堆积的时代相近或稍晚。根据古脊椎动物研究室吴汝康教授的初步观察，这个人类化石似较中国猿人为进步。
    此外，调查队在同一地区还找到了大量高等灵长类的化石，其中至少有5个牙齿是属于过去发现的所谓“南方巨猿”或“南方巨人”的化石。
    现在，发掘工作还在继续进行中。
