Planting rice on the beach – the state-owned farm in Zhao’an County, Fujian Province, has created such an experience.

Last spring, the farm reclaimed 600 mu of beach from the sea. According to past practices, newly reclaimed beaches must be desalinated for three to five years before rice can be planted due to the high salt content. However, at the suggestion of the young technician Shen Xingzu, the young workers of the farm's production team used the method of draining and sun-drying, and freshwater washing to remove salt, so that 600 mu of beach land could be planted with rice in the same year. They first drained the water from the newly reclaimed 600 mu of beach, let the sun bake it for more than 60 days to evaporate as much salt as possible from the soil, and then introduced freshwater to wash it more than 10 times. In this way, the salt content of the soil was reduced from the original 3% to 0.08%, which was suitable for rice growth. By July, all 600 mu of newly reclaimed beach land was planted with single-season late rice. Later, a reservoir was built to continue washing more than 30 times, so that the salt content of the soil continued to decrease. As a result, the 600 mu of beach land harvested more than 160,000 jin of rice, with an average yield of 278 jin per mu, and the highest yield per unit area reached 533 jin.

    海滩上种水稻
    海滩上能种水稻，福建省诏安县国营农场创造了这样的经验。
    这个农场在去年春天与海争地，围垦了600亩海滩。按照过去的习惯，新围垦的海滩因为盐分多，必须经过三、五年养淡后才能种植水稻。但是农场生产队的青年工人们在青年技术员沈形祖的倡议下，用排干曝晒，淡水洗盐的方法，使600亩海滩地当年就种上了水稻。他们先把新围垦的600亩海滩地上的水排干，让太阳晒了60多天，使土壤中的盐分尽量蒸发，然后又引进淡水冲洗了10多次。这样，终于使土壤从原来含盐量的3％降低到0.08％，适宜水稻生长。到7月间，600亩新垦海滩地就全部种上单季晚稻。以后又修起一座蓄水库，继续冲洗30多次，使土壤的盐分继续下降。结果600亩海滩地共收获了16万多斤稻谷，平均每亩收获278斤，最高单位面积产量达到533斤。（据新华社讯）
