Greening the Motherland

Forests are one of the most valuable resources of the country. They are of utmost importance to the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation, the improvement of people's lives, and the transformation of the natural environment. Since liberation, our country's afforestation work has made great achievements. However, due to the limited forest resources left over from old China and their extremely uneven distribution, the existing forest resources are far from meeting the growing needs of national construction and the people for timber. According to rough estimates, the forest area of our country only accounts for 7.9% of the total land area, which is far from sufficient to regulate the climate and conserve water and soil. In order to change this situation, a large-scale greening campaign must be launched throughout the country, striving to eliminate all possible barren mountains and wastelands within 12 years.

Is it possible to accomplish in such a short period of time what our ancestors dared not think of or do for thousands of years? We Chinese have an old saying: "It takes ten years to grow trees." Its meaning is that large-scale tree planting, though not easy, is not very difficult either. Since liberation, the protective forests built by the state in western Northeast China and eastern Inner Mongolia, the protective forests in the sandy areas of western Hebei, and the protective forests in eastern Henan have begun to play a role in preventing wind and sand and protecting farmland. Many regions have also achieved remarkable results in a short period of time by planting trees themselves. In Yushe County, Shanxi Province, the forests were destroyed for a long time by the reactionary ruling class, and the local mountains and fields lost their cover, causing the turbid Zhang River to often flood, destroying 150,000 mu of fertile land and making the lives of farmers extremely difficult. After liberation, the party and government leading organs in Yushe County mobilized farmers to actively plant trees and close mountains for afforestation. Now more than 100,000 mu of forest have been established, the turbid water of the Zhang River has become clear, and 50,000 mu of farmland that was destroyed in the past has been restored. The total output value of timber in the county reaches more than 69,000 yuan per year. Yulin County in Shaanxi Province was forced to move its county seat three times to the south due to wind and sand; many villages and farmlands in the county were submerged by shifting sands, and many fertile grasslands became alkaline beaches and sand dunes. After liberation, the government led the local people to build sand-prevention forests. From 1950 to 1955, Yulin County afforested more than 85,800 mu of land, and many sandy areas became lush woodland. The scene of dust and sand filling the air for more than a hundred years has greatly changed, and houses and farmland close to the desert are no longer threatened by shifting sands. The greening experience in these areas tells us that as long as the work of afforestation, forestry, and forest protection is done well, the newly planted trees can become forests in four or five years, or seven or eight years, and begin to benefit the people.

It was absolutely impossible to green the motherland in the old days of scattered small-scale farming. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, relying on the support of the state and the power of cooperation, anything can be achieved. If each of the 500 million farmers in the country plants two trees each year, there will be 1 billion trees in a year. Adding in urban residents, how many trees should be planted in a year?

In order to launch a large-scale greening campaign throughout the country, it is necessary to carry out widespread publicity and education on greening the motherland in all rural and urban areas, so that this great ideal is known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. As long as the broad masses of people regard greening work as their own vital cause, they will actively participate in this work.

Agricultural producers' cooperatives should become the main force in the greening movement. All cooperatives in mountainous areas should organize considerable manpower and material resources in accordance with the overall plan for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and based on the needs of water and soil conservation and the principle of rational land use, to carry out afforestation, close mountains for afforestation, and forest protection work according to local conditions. Implementing diversified operations that combine agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry is the fundamental way for people in mountainous areas to develop production and improve their lives. The people of Yangjingdi in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, Gongqian Township in Xingning County, Guangdong Province, and other places have implemented unified management of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and adopted various soil and water conservation measures, quickly changing the original natural appearance and gradually embarking on the road to abundance. Agricultural producers' cooperatives and individual farmers in plain areas should also plant as many trees as possible along rivers, canals, roads, farmland, and houses in order to beautify the environment and increase income. All members of government organs, organizations, factories, mines, schools, and troops should also actively participate in the greening movement. The approximately 190 million young people across the country should become a vital force in the greening movement and better play their role in the great cause of greening the motherland.

The task of greening the motherland must be realized in stages and batches under comprehensive planning and guidance. Each province (autonomous region), county, and township must formulate greening plans level by level according to the needs of developing production, improving people's lives, and possible conditions. The greening plans of each region must determine the key areas that need to be greened first. From a national perspective, the provinces in North China and Northwest China, where forests are scarce and waterlogging, drought, wind, and sand disasters are more serious, should be the focus of greening work. The party committees and governments of these provinces (autonomous regions) should devote more effort to developing forestry and accelerating the greening of their provinces (autonomous regions). Other provinces, counties, and townships should also determine key areas that urgently need greening. In the greening plan, the proportion of various tree species and forest types (such as timber forests, special economic forests, water source forests, windbreak and sand-fixation forests, etc.) must be reasonably determined. Generally speaking, more timber forests should be planted, and more fast-growing and versatile tree species suitable for local growth should be planted. When determining the ratio of tree species and forest types, we must take into account both immediate and long-term interests, and both the needs of our own cooperative and township and the needs of the country.

We must, through the work of comprehensive planning, criticize and overcome conservative thinking, and strive to strengthen the material preparation and organizational leadership of forestry work. Large-scale afforestation requires a large number of tree species and seedlings. Relying solely on state-owned nurseries to cultivate seedlings cannot meet the needs of afforestation at all. The problem of tree species and seedlings is mainly solved by the local agricultural producers' cooperatives themselves. All areas preparing for afforestation should designate one or two qualified cooperatives in each township to set up nurseries to supply the seedlings needed by the township. In the greening movement, we must strengthen technical guidance, promote the advanced experience of afforestation units, improve the survival rate of trees, and accelerate the speed of greening. In order to strengthen the organizational leadership of grassroots afforestation units, forestry departments should universally establish forestry workstations in districts within one or two years, and strengthen the guidance and assistance to rural forestry production through this grassroots organization. In addition, forest management offices in forest areas and afforestation bureaus in key areas should be expanded and strengthened.

Greening the motherland is the responsibility of everyone. The people of the whole country must act and participate in the greening movement. We must not only green mountainous areas, but also green plains; we must not only green rural areas, but also green cities. We must green all places that can be greened, so that the mountains and rivers of the motherland become more prosperous and beautiful.

    绿化祖国
    森林是国家最贵重的资源之一，它对工业、农业、交通运输业的发展、人民生活的改善和自然环境的改造，都有极重要的关系。解放以来，我国的造林工作已经有了很大的成绩。但是，由于旧中国遗留的森林资源太少，分布极不平衡，现有的林木资源远远不能满足国家建设和人民对木材日益增长的需要。根据粗略的估计，我国的森林面积只占国土总面积的7.9％，远远不足以调节气候，保蓄水土。为了改变这种情况，必须在全国范围内，开展一个大规模的绿化运动，争取在12年的时间内，消灭一切可能消灭的荒山荒地。
    在这样短的时间内作到我们的先人千百年来不敢想、不能作的事，是不是可能的呢？我们中国有句古话：“十年树木”。它的意思是说，大规模地种树，虽然不是容易的事，但也不是很困难的。解放以来，国家营造的东北西部、内蒙古东部的防护林，河北西部沙荒地区的防护林，河南东部的防护林，现在已经开始发生防御风沙、保护农田的作用。许多地区群众自己动手造林，也在很短的时期内创造了显著的成绩。山西省榆社县的森林遭受反动统治阶级长期破坏，当地的山野失掉被复，以致浊漳河水常常泛滥，先后冲毁15万亩良田，农民生活困苦不堪。解放以后，榆社县党政领导机关发动农民积极造林和封山育林，现已成林10万多亩，浊漳河的浑水变成清流，过去被冲毁的农田已经恢复了5万亩，全县木材产值每年达到69，000多元。陕西省榆林县城被风沙逼迫，曾经三次南迁；县境中的许多村庄和农田被流沙淹没，许多肥美的草原变成了碱滩和沙丘。解放以后，政府领导当地人民营造防沙林。从1950年到1955年的6年中，榆林县共造林85，800多亩，不少风沙地区变成繁茂的林地，百多年来沙尘弥漫的景象已有很大改变，紧靠沙漠的房屋和农田再不受流沙侵袭。这些地区的绿化经验告诉我们：只要把造林、育林和护林的工作做好，在四、五年或者七、八年内，新种的树木就能成林，开始给人民造福。
    在分散的小农经济的旧时代，绝不可能绿化祖国。解放后，在党和政府的正确领导下，依靠国家的支援和合作化的力量，就什么也能够做到。如果全国5万万农民每人每年种两棵树，一年就有10万万棵。再加上城市居民，一年该种多少树啊。
    为了在全国范围内开展一个大规模的绿化运动，必须在所有乡村和城市中，普遍地进行关于绿化祖国的宣传教育，让这个伟大的理想家喻户晓，深入人心。只要广大群众把绿化工作看做自己的切身事业，他们就会踊跃地参加这个工作。
    农业生产合作社应当成为绿化运动的主力。一切山区的合作社都要按照农业、林业、牧业的全面规划，根据水土保持的需要和合理利用土地的原则，组织相当的人力物力，因地制宜地进行造林、封山育林和护林工作。实行农业、林业、牧业相结合的多种经营，是山区人民发展生产、改善生活的根本途径。山西省平顺县羊井底、广东省兴宁县宫前乡等地人民实行农业、林业、牧业的统一经营，采取各种水土保持措施，很快地改变了原来的自然面貌，逐步走上丰衣足食的道路。平原地区的农业生产合作社和个体农民，也要尽可能地在河渠、道路、农田、房屋旁边多多栽树，以便美化环境，增加收益。一切机关、团体、工厂、矿山、学校、部队的成员，也都要积极参加绿化运动。全国19，000万左右的青少年更应该成为绿化运动中的生力军，在绿化祖国的伟大事业中更好地发挥自己的作用。
    绿化祖国的任务必须在全面规划和指导下分期分批地实现。各省（区）、县、乡都要根据发展生产、改善人民生活的需要和可能的条件，逐级制定绿化规划。各个地区的绿化规划中都要确定需要首先绿化的重点地区。从全国来说，森林稀少、水旱风沙灾害较重的华北、西北各省，应当是绿化工作的重点。这些省（区）的党委和政府，应当拿出更大的力量来发展林业，加速本省（区）的绿化。其他各省、县、乡也都应当确定迫切需要绿化的重点地区。在绿化规划中，必须合理地确定各种树种和林种（如用材林、特种经济林、水源林、防风防沙林等等）的比例。一般地说，应该多种用材林，多种适于本地生长的收益快和用途大的树种。在确定树种、林种比例的时候，既要照顾眼前的利益，也要照顾长远的利益，既要照顾本社、本乡的需要，也要照顾国家的需要。
    必须通过全面规划的工作，批判和克服保守思想，努力加强林业工作的物质准备和组织领导。大规模造林需要大量树种和苗木，光靠国营苗圃培育苗木，根本不能满足造林的需要。树种、树苗问题主要地是依靠各地农业生产合作社自己解决。凡是准备造林的地区，每个乡都要指定一两个有条件的合作社设立苗圃，供应本乡所需要的苗木。在绿化运动中要加强技术指导，推广造林单位的先进经验，提高林木成活率，加快绿化的速度。为了加强对基层造林单位的组织领导，林业部门应当在一两年内把区的林业工作站普遍建立起来，通过这个基层机构，加强对农村林业生产的指导和帮助。此外，林区的森林经营所和重点地区的造林局都应当增建和充实起来。
    绿化祖国，人人有责。全国人民行动起来，参加绿化运动。我们既要绿化山区，也要绿化平原，既要绿化乡村，也要绿化城市。我们一定要绿化一切可以绿化的地方，使祖国的河山变得更加富饶美丽。
