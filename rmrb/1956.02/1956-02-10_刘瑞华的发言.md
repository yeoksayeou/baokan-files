Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow representatives:

After listening to Premier Zhou and the other leaders' reports, I am very excited. Our country has made leaps and bounds in all aspects. At the same time, I deeply appreciate the Party and the government's emphasis and care for intellectuals and scientific and cultural undertakings. I fully support these reports. As a member of the intellectuals, I personally feel that for a long time, even during the seven years after liberation, our contribution to the people and the country has been very small. Our country's scientific and technological level is still quite backward, especially in medical and health undertakings. At the same time, the number of experts in our country is relatively small, and the distribution is not entirely reasonable. For example, in the medical field, there are still a few experts who are still in private practice, and their strength has not been fully utilized. Some people are burdened with too many concurrent jobs and administrative affairs. Also, many experts, including myself, more or less have bourgeois ideas, even sectarian sentiments, and cannot cooperate well. These are also the reasons for the stagnation of medical science. Now that the country's industrial construction is developing rapidly, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has been a complete victory, the current level of medical science is far from meeting the needs of the country and the people. For example, the noise problem in industrial and mining enterprises, the occupational disease problem of workers, this type of research work has not been vigorously carried out. At present, the number and quality of physicians in various departments cannot meet the actual needs. We cannot tolerate the continued existence of this situation.

In order to improve the level of medical science and cooperate with the country's socialist construction, we must carry out scientific research work. Do we have the conditions and confidence to carry out this work? I think we do. We can fully tap the potential of our existing experts, so that they can play a major role in scientific research; we can get help from the Soviet Union and other countries; we can absorb the achievements of traditional Chinese medicine; to comprehensively promote the progress of medical science in our country. We must attach importance to the enthusiasm and creativity of the younger generation of scientific workers in our country, cultivate them, trust them, and enable them to give full play to their talents in scientific research. On the other hand, our country's scientific workers also have more or less research experience, but the results are not yet significant. Taking my personal research on the problem of deafness and muteness in the past year as an example, I have discovered that a few deaf-mute children have residual hearing that can be used. If they do not enter ordinary schools for the deaf and mute but are given special training, they will not become "mutes." We should try to solve similar problems. I believe that similar problems still exist quite commonly.

Therefore, we should immediately overcome conservative ideas, make concrete plans, and establish specialized research institutions as soon as possible. We should select qualified units and adopt expansion or merger methods to establish a batch first. We can say that the country is not only in a high tide of economic construction, but the development of scientific research work will also enter a high tide. At present, research institutes for dermatology and venereology, tuberculosis, and epidemiology have already been established. I am an otolaryngologist, and I believe that as long as we add subjective efforts, it is possible to establish a research institute on the basis of the existing otolaryngology undertakings in the country. Perhaps other departments have better conditions. Therefore, the time for the establishment of research institutes in various departments has not yet come. At the same time, while taking care of the needs of regional work, experts should be appropriately allocated, used in a concentrated manner, absorb Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in the work, vigorously cultivate and promote young cadres, and provide necessary assistance to extramural research institutions by higher medical colleges. Under the leadership of the Party and the government and with the support of manpower and material resources, we will carry out our scientific research work and catch up with or even surpass the scientific level of advanced countries in the world within a certain period of time. Although I am old, I will still do my best to be a pioneer in the ranks of marching towards science and contribute my own strength!

I fully agree with what Dean Guo Moruo pointed out in his report: the situation of intellectuals being self-righteous and not united still exists. This phenomenon is also common in the medical field. This kind of bourgeois style not only hinders personal progress, but also brings huge losses to work. The times, society, the country, and the people require us to unite as one and do a good job. We should strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism theory, improve socialist ideological awareness, form an unbreakable alliance with workers and peasants, and eliminate all hidden enemies, purify our ranks, and welcome the glorious task of building a socialist motherland!

    刘瑞华的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    在听了周总理及其他几位首长的报告后，我非常兴奋。我们的国家在各方面已有了飞跃的进步。同时我也深深地体会到党和政府对知识分子和科学文化事业的重视和关怀。我完全拥护这些报告。作为知识分子的一员，个人感到长时期来甚至解放后的7年中，我们对人民和国家的贡献是非常少的。我国的科学技术水平还相当落后，在医药卫生事业方面表现的尤为突出。同时我国专家数量较少，分布的情况也不尽合理。例如医学界中尚有少数专家仍在私人开业，未能把他们的力量充分地发挥出来。有些人则担负着过多的兼职和行政事务。还有许多专家，包括个人在内，或多或少地存在有资产阶级思想，甚至有宗派主义情绪，不能很好地合作。这些也是使医学科学停滞不前的原因。当现在祖国的工业建设正在飞速发展，农业、手工业、资本主义工商业社会主义改造全面胜利的时候，目前医学科学的水平，远不能适应国家和人民的需要。例如工矿企业中的噪音问题，工人群众的职业病问题，这类研究工作还没有大力地展开。目前，各科医师在数量上和质量上也不能满足实际上的需要。我们不能容忍这种情况的继续存在。
    为了提高医学科学水平，配合国家社会主义建设，我们必需开展科学研究工作。我们有没有条件和信心来开展这项工作呢？我认为是有的。我们可以充分地挖掘我国现有专家的潜在力量，使在科学研究工作中发挥主要作用；我们可以获得苏联和其他国家的帮助；我们可以吸取祖国医学的成果；来全面推动我国医学的前进。我们必需重视我国青年一代科学工作者的积极性和创造性，培养他们，信任他们，使他们能在科学研究工作中发挥其才能。另一方面，我国的科学工作者们，也都或多或少地有些研究经验，只是成绩还不大。即以个人近一年来研究聋哑问题而论，已经发现少数聋哑儿童具有可以利用的残余听力，如果他们不进入普通的聋哑学校而施以特殊的训练，他们便不致成为“哑巴”。我们应当设法解决类似这样的问题。我相信，类似这样的问题，在目前还相当普遍地存在着。
    因此，我们应该即刻克服保守思想，具体规划，尽速成立各专科研究机构，选择有条件的单位，采取扩充或合并的方式，先成立一批。我们可以说，目前国家不仅是正处于经济建设的高潮，科学研究工作的开展也将进入高潮。现在皮肤性病科、结核科、流行病科等研究所业已成立。个人是一个耳鼻咽喉科医务工作者，我认为只要加上主观努力，在国内现有的耳鼻咽喉科事业的基础上，就有可能成立研究所，在其他科系也许具备有更好的条件。因此成立各科研究所的时机并不是没有到来。同时在照顾地区工作需要的情况下，专家适当调配，集中使用，吸收中医参加工作，大力地培养和提拔青年干部，并由高等医学院校给予院外研究机构提供必要的帮助，在党和政府领导及人力物力的支持下，来开展我们的科学研究工作，在一定时间内迎头赶上甚至超过世界上先进国家的科学水平。个人虽已年老，但还要竭尽所能，在向科学进军的队伍中当一名尖兵，贡献出自己的力量！
    我完全同意郭沫若院长报告中所指出的：知识分子之间自以为是、互不团结的情况是仍然存在的。在医学界中这种现象也不少见。这类资产阶级的作风，不但妨碍了个人的进步，给工作也带来了巨大的损失。时代和社会、国家和人民要求我们团结一致，搞好工作。我们应当加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习，提高社会主义思想觉悟，与工、农群众结成牢不可破的联盟，并清除出一切暗藏的敌人，纯洁我们的队伍，来迎接建设社会主义祖国的光荣任务！
