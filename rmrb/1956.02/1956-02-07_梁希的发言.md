Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

	I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and agree with the reports made by Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, and Committee Member Chen Boda.

	As a 72-year-old intellectual living in the magnificent Mao Zedong era of socialist revolution, I feel honored and excited at every moment. As someone engaged in scientific work, I am particularly encouraged to hear the guidelines in Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report regarding the formulation of a long-term plan for the development of science in our country.

	Chairman Zhou Enlai stated in his report: "On the whole, the state of science and technology in our country still lags far behind the advanced levels of the world. We must mobilize all the forces of intellectuals to catch up with the advanced scientific and cultural levels of the world in a not-too-long period. This is a great and glorious combat task for the people of our country, especially the intellectuals." This passage is a valuable guideline for us intellectuals, especially scientific workers, to strive in our work.

	To bring our country's science and technology up to world standards, we cannot rely solely on a small number of professors, researchers, and engineers. We must also enable the majority of workers and peasants to learn the necessary and increasingly advanced science and technology. Only by combining everyone together into a whole, seeking progress, and seeking knowledge, can we bring both theory and practice up to international standards simultaneously. Therefore, scientific and technological workers must constantly pass on knowledge to the people.

	Now, please allow me to briefly report on the situation of the Science and Technology Popularization Association.

	Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the China Association for Science and Technology has achieved preliminary development over the past five years. Now, branches have been established in all provinces and cities across the country, except for Tibet and Xinjiang (a total of 29), and sub-branches have also been established in some prefecture-level cities and counties (a total of 110). The number of experts, professors, engineers, doctors, and other scientific and technological workers who have joined the association has reached more than 36,000. Over the past five years, the association has organized its members to conduct more than 48,000 scientific lectures and reports, held more than 3,100 scientific exhibitions, compiled more than 2,300 popular science publications, and distributed 13 million copies. The association's popular science magazines include "Science Popularization" and "Science Pictorial," with a total circulation of over 142,000 copies per issue.

	In recent years, in conjunction with the needs of the country's socialist construction, various regions have regularly given systematic lectures to workers on basic scientific knowledge such as "Physics Knowledge" and "Chemistry Knowledge," as well as technical knowledge such as "Machine Manufacturing Knowledge" and "Electrical Engineering." Professor Zhao Xuetian, a member of the association, created the "Rapid Blueprint Reading Method for Mechanical Workers," which he also mentioned in his speech at the conference. Recently, Comrade Gao Jing, a member of our Harbin City association, also created a rapid blueprint reading method for construction workers, and the effect of its promotion has also been very good.

	The association has organized large-scale lectures and publicity on "Socialist Industrialization" and the First Five-Year Plan throughout the country.

	In order to help the masses establish a materialist worldview and eliminate superstitious ideas, the association has conducted publicity on the history of natural development, solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, etc., and is currently building an astronomical museum in Beijing to popularize astronomical knowledge. In the medical field, in addition to giving general health knowledge to the general working people, it also gives advanced theoretical knowledge such as "Pavlov's Theory" to medical cadres.

	The association also frequently conducts a large number of lectures introducing the Soviet Union, widely introducing the Soviet Union's advanced scientific and technological achievements and great communist construction achievements to the people of our country. Such as Michurin's theory, Pavlov's theory, as well as high-speed cutting, close planting of small seedlings, etc.

	However, the association's work is still far behind the actual needs. In the past, the association gave only more than 10,000 lectures a year, but now, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions requires the association to give more than 390,000 lectures to the trade union system this year alone. The People's Liberation Army also requires the association to ensure that every soldier and officer in the national People's Liberation Army can hear a scientific lecture once a month within a short period of time; this amounts to no less than hundreds of thousands of times each year. The demands of the peasants, who have now cooperated, are even greater, amounting to millions of times.

	Recently, after reading the draft National Agricultural Development Program, we have become even more aware of our important responsibilities in rural work. The program mentions increasing the production of grain and cotton, developing animal husbandry, preventing and controlling animal diseases, building water conservancy projects, improving fertilization methods, promoting improved varieties, eliminating pests and diseases, greening the motherland, conserving soil and water, eliminating the four pests, protecting women and children, etc., all of which require the cooperation of popular science work. Now, the general association for popular science and its branches are preparing a large number of lecture drafts and models, specimens, instruments, and pictures for use in conjunction with lectures, and are preparing to vigorously carry out lecture and publicity activities.

	We hope that the Party and government leaders in various regions will help us establish sub-branches in counties and cities across the country that have the conditions, so that scientific and technological workers across the country have the opportunity to participate in popularization work.

	We hope that all relevant parties in our country will pay attention to popular science work and vigorously support the development of the association's work.

	We further hope that the broad masses of scientific and technological workers in our country will enthusiastically join the ranks of the association, contribute more of their strength, improve the scientific and technical level of the workers and peasants in our country, and promote the great socialist construction of our country.

    梁希的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，同意李济深副主席、郭沫若副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武副主席、陈伯达委员所做的各项报告。
    我是一个72岁的知识分子，生活在这样伟大的社会主义革命高潮的毛泽东时代，无时无刻不感到光荣和兴奋。我是一个从事科学工作的人，听到周恩来主席政治报告中关于制定我国科学发展远景计划的方针，尤其使我得到鼓舞。
    周恩来主席的报告里说：“从整个说来，我国科学和技术的状况仍然是落在世界先进水平的后面很远。我们必须动员知识分子的一切力量，在不太长的时间内赶上世界的先进的科学文化水平。这是我国人民首先是知识分子的一个伟大的光荣的战斗的任务。”这一段话是指示我们知识分子，尤其是科学工作者奋力工作的宝贵的指针。
    要把我国的科学技术赶上世界水平，不能单靠少数的教授、研究员、工程师，还必须使大多数工农劳动人民，都学习必需的而且日益增高的科学技术。大家结合起来，成为一个整体，求进步，求知识，才可使理论和实际同时赶上国际水平。因此，科学技术工作者必须随时把知识交给人民。
    现在，请允许我简略地报告一下科学技术普及协会的情形。
    中华全国科学技术普及协会五年多来在党和政府的领导下，得到初步的发展。现在全国各省市，除了西藏、新疆等地外，都已建立了分会（共29个），部分省辖市和县也建立了支会（共110个），专家、教授、工程师、医生以及其他科学技术工作者加入协会的已达36，000多人。五年多来，协会共组织会员进行了48，000多次科学讲演、报告，举办了3，100多次科学展览，编写了2，300多种通俗的科学读物，发行了1，300万册。协会所办的通俗科学杂志有“科学大众”和“科学画报”，每期的发行总数已达142，000多份。
    几年来，协会结合国家的社会主义建设的需要，各地都经常地对工人们系统讲演了“物理知识”、“化学知识”等基础科学知识和“机器制造知识”“电机技术”等技术知识。协会会员赵学田教授创造了“机械工人速成看图法”，他在大会发言里也提到了。最近，我们哈尔滨市的会员高竞同志又创造了建筑工人速成看图法，推广的效果也很好。
    协会在全国大规模地组织了“社会主义工业化”的讲演宣传和第一个五年计划的讲演宣传。
    为了帮助人民群众树立唯物主义的世界观，肃清迷信思想，协会进行了关于自然发展史、日食、月食等宣传，现在正在北京建筑一座普及天文知识的天文馆。在医学方面，不仅对一般劳动人民讲卫生常识，还对医务干部讲“巴甫洛夫学说”等先进的理论知识。
    协会还经常大量地进行介绍苏联的讲演，向我国人民广泛地介绍了苏联的先进的科学技术成就和伟大的共产主义建设成就。如米丘林学说、巴甫洛夫学说，以及高速切削、小株密植等。
    不过协会的工作现在还远远落后于实际的需要，在过去，协会每年讲演不过一万余次，而现在，中华全国总工会要求协会在今年就为工会系统讲演39万余次，人民解放军也要求协会在短期内作到使全国解放军的每个战士和军官，每月都能听到一次科学讲演；这样每年又不下数十万次。合作起来了的农民的要求更为浩大，那是要以百万次计的。
    最近，我们看了全国农业发展纲要草案以后，更加意识到了我们在农村工作上的重大责任，纲要之中所提到的增加粮棉等生产、发展畜牧、防治兽疫、兴修水利、改进施肥方法、推广优良品种、消灭病虫害、绿化祖国、保持水土、除四害、保护妇女儿童等等，都需要科学技术普及工作来配合。现在科普总会和分会正在准备大量的讲稿和配合讲演用的模型、标本、仪器、图片、幻灯片，准备大力地开展讲演宣传。
    我们希望：各地党政领导上帮助我们在全国有条件的县市都建立起支会来，使全国科学技术工作者都有机会参加普及工作。
    我们希望：我国各有关方面对科普工作都重视起来，大力支持协会工作的开展。
    我们更希望：我国广大的科学技术工作者都热烈地参加到协会的行列中来，更多地献出自己的力量来，提高我国工农劳动群众的科学、技术水平，促进我国伟大的社会主义建设。
