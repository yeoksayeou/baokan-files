Strictly Prevent Forest Fires

Forest fires are the most ferocious enemy of forest resources. In 1955, there were many forest fires and burned forests throughout the country. Existing forest areas are the main bases for supplying the wood needed for national construction and people's lives in the next 30 to 50 years, and forests in mountainous areas throughout the country are basic conditions for maintaining soil and water and ensuring agricultural harvests. Protecting existing forests is an extremely important task for Party and government leading organs and the broad masses in mountainous areas.

In the past few years, forest protection and fire prevention work in various parts of our country has made progress, but forest fires are still quite serious. The most important reason for this is that some Party and government leading organs, especially leading cadres at the district and township levels, have not yet truly recognized the serious situation of the shortage of forest resources in our country, and do not understand the harm of destroying forests to the country's long-term construction and soil and water conservation. Every time the fire season arrives, although they routinely arrange some forest protection and fire prevention work, because they have not carried out practical publicity, education, and organizational work, and have not gone deep into the masses to find out the main roots of forest fires, and helped the masses summarize and popularize methods to prevent forest fires, they cannot produce significant results. Some local staff members also mistakenly believe that carrying out forest protection and fire prevention will affect agricultural production, and actually put these two tasks in opposition. In some areas, leading organs and judicial departments do not conduct necessary investigations into forest fire incidents, and do not give the perpetrators the punishment they deserve, which connives at counter-revolutionaries and bad elements to continue destroying forests and affects the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation and forest protection. In Shaodong County, Hunan Province, more than 100 forest fire cases have occurred one after another. The masses demanded handling, but the court has been delaying the decision. Local farmers are very dissatisfied with this phenomenon.

Therefore, Party and government leading organs in mountainous areas must take forest protection and fire prevention as a regular and important task; cooperatives in mountainous areas should also take forest protection and cultivation as an important part of production. Countless facts show that in mountainous areas, grasping the important link of forest protection and fire prevention can not only effectively protect forests, but also promote other work. In the spring of 1955, the Right Wing Middle Banner of Horqin in Inner Mongolia took forest protection and fire prevention as one of the central tasks in the spring, and combined it with spring plowing production and grain "three fix" and other tasks, completely eliminated the threat of forest fires, and the masses could work at ease.

Conducting in-depth publicity and education on forest protection and fire prevention for the masses is the primary condition for strengthening forest protection and fire prevention work. It is necessary to use specific examples to make calculations and comparisons, and repeatedly explain the role of protecting forests in industrial construction, agricultural production, and people's lives, so as to change people's wrong understanding that "forests are all over the mountains and fields, and it doesn't matter if a little bit is burned." Recently, Guangxi Province, combined with the cooperativization movement, launched a mass forest protection and fire prevention movement, carried out extensive publicity to the masses, and required district and township-level organs to strengthen the leadership of forest protection and fire prevention work, so that forest protection and fire prevention work took root among the masses and produced good results.

At present, most of the forest fires that occur in various places, in addition to natural fires and arson by counter-revolutionaries, are caused by farmers' careless use of fire in production (burning mountains to reclaim land, burning grass to fumigate fertilizer, etc.). 80% of the forest fires in the provinces south of the Yangtze River are caused in this way. Therefore, as long as the use of fire in production is strictly controlled, most forest fires can be eliminated. The leading organs in mountainous areas should help the masses study and summarize methods for controlling the use of fire in production or change the original habits of using fire. As long as the masses are told clearly about the pros and cons and a model is made, this is not difficult to do. Shuru Township, Huaiji County, Guangdong Province, adopted an organized and led collective burning reclamation method and strictly implemented the system of asking for instructions and approval for burning mountains. Since liberation, there has not been a single fire. Xiabang Township, Qi District, Guangning County, used the method of沤green manure to replace the method of going up the mountain to burn ash to accumulate fertilizer, which increased the yield of farmland and avoided forest fires. We must help the masses summarize experience, lead them to formulate practical and feasible methods, make resolutions through district and township people's congresses, and mobilize every household to sign fire prevention covenants.

For forest fire incidents that have already occurred, the causes must be investigated in a timely manner, lessons learned, and dealt with seriously. It is necessary to give severe punishment to counter-revolutionaries and other criminals who set fires to burn mountains, and give appropriate commendations and rewards to collectives and individuals who have made contributions to fire prevention and firefighting. Only by seriously handling specific examples of forest fires, educating cadres and the masses, and improving their awareness and vigilance can forest fires be prevented more effectively.

Some ethnic minorities who live in mountainous forest areas still follow the production habits of "slash-and-burn cultivation" and "extensive planting and thin harvest," which is very harmful to forests. In these areas, we should follow the state's ethnic policies and carry out publicity on forest protection and fire prevention in forms that are popular with the local masses; at the same time, we should help ethnic minority farmers improve their production technology and gradually change backward production methods and old fire habits. In order to do this work well, it is necessary to cultivate forest protection backbones and forest protection models among ethnic minorities, and educate the masses through them to implement the fire prevention system. The Oroqen people in the Greater Khingan Mountains used to often burn forests. Since the local government helped them settle down and improved their production methods, and combined hunting activities with forest protection work, forest fires there have been basically eliminated.

In large state-owned forest areas with sparse population and inconvenient transportation, necessary forest management agencies should be established and improved according to actual needs, and fire prevention facilities should be strengthened so that forest resources can be managed by specialized institutions and personnel as soon as possible. In the private forest areas in the south, there was a habit of hiring mountain watchers to protect forests. Under the principle of benefiting forest farmers and the voluntary participation of the masses, it can continue to be implemented. However, no matter what kind of area, the organizational work of mass forest protection and fire prevention should not be relaxed because of the establishment of professional institutions. Only by effectively combining the enthusiasm of the masses for forest protection and fire prevention with the organizational leadership of specialized institutions can forest protection and fire prevention work be truly done well.

### 严防山林火灾

    严防山林火灾
    山林火灾是森林资源最凶恶的敌人。1955年全国发生的山林火灾和烧毁的山林都很不少。现有林区是今后三、五十年供应国家建设和人民生活所需木材的主要基地，而全国各地山区的森林都是当地保持水土、保障农田丰收的基本条件。把现有的森林保护好，是山区党政领导机关和广大群众的一项极为重要的任务。
    几年以来，我国各地的护林防火工作有进步，但是现在山林火灾还相当严重。这里边最主要的原因，是有些党政领导机关，特别是区乡一级的领导干部，还没有真正认识我国森林资源过少的严重情况，不了解破坏森林对于国家长期建设和保持水土的危害。他们每到发生山火的季节，虽然照例布置一些护林防火的工作，但是，因为没有进行切实的宣传教育和组织工作，没有深入群众找出发生山火的主要根源，帮助群众总结和推广防止山火的办法，所以不能发生显著的效果。有些地方工作人员还错误地认为进行护林防火要影响农业生产，竟把这两项工作对立起来。有些地区的领导机关和司法部门，对于山林火灾事件不进行必要的追究，对于肇事者不给以应得的处分，这就纵容了反革命分子和坏分子继续破坏森林，影响了群众造林护林的积极性。湖南省邵东县先后发生100多次山火案件，群众要求处理，法院一直拖延不决。当地农民对这种现象很不满意。
    因此，山区党政领导机关必须把护林防火工作作为一个经常的重要任务；山区的合作社更要把护林、育林作为一个重要的生产内容。无数事实说明，在山区抓住护林防火这个重要环节，不仅可以有效地保护山林，而且可以推动其他工作。1955年春，内蒙古科尔沁右翼中旗，把护林防火作为春季中心工作之一，和春耕生产、粮食“三定”等项工作结合进行，彻底消灭了山火的威胁，群众都能安心生产。
    对群众进行深入的护林防火的宣传教育，是加强护林防火工作的首要条件。要通过具体事例，进行算账对比，反复说明保护森林对于工业建设、农业生产和人民生活的作用，使人们改变那种“满山遍野是森林，烧一点不算什么”的错误认识。广西省最近结合合作化运动，开展了一个群众性的护林防火运动，向群众进行广泛的宣传，要区乡一级机关加强护林防火工作的领导，使护林防火工作在群众中扎了根，发生了良好效果。
    现在各地发生的山火，除了天然火灾和反革命分子纵火以外，多数是因为农民生产用火（烧山垦地，烧草熏肥等等）不慎成灾。江南各省80％的山火是这样引起的。因此，只要把生产用火加以严格的控制，就能消灭多数山林的火灾。山区的领导机关应当帮助群众研究和总结控制生产用火的办法或者改变原有用火的习惯，只要向群众讲清利害，作出样子，这是不难作到的。广东省怀集县仕儒乡采用有组织有领导的集体烧垦办法，严格执行烧山要请示、批准的制度，解放以来没有发生一次火灾；广宁县七区下蚌乡用沤绿肥的办法代替上山烧灰积肥的办法，增加了农田产量，避免了山林火灾。我们要帮助群众总结经验，领导他们定出切实可行的办法，通过区乡人民代表大会作出决议，发动家家户户订立防火公约。
    对于已经发生的山火事件，要及时追究原因，总结教训，严肃处理。必须给纵火烧山的反革命分子和其他犯罪分子以严厉的惩罚，对防火、救火有功的集体和个人给以适当的表扬和奖励。通过严肃处理山火的具体事例，教育干部和群众，提高他们的觉悟和警惕性，才能更有效地防止山火。
    有些聚居山林地区的少数民族，还沿袭着“刀耕火种”、“广种薄收”的生产习惯，这对森林的危害很大。在这些地区，应当遵照国家的民族政策，采取当地群众喜闻乐见的形式，进行护林防火的宣传；同时要帮助少数民族农民提高生产技术，逐步改变落后的生产方式和旧的用火习惯。为了作好这一工作，必须在少数民族中培养护林骨干和护林模范，通过他们教育群众贯彻执行防火制度。大兴安岭上的鄂伦春族人民，过去经常发生烧毁森林的事情。自从当地政府帮助他们定居下来，改进了生产方式，使打猎活动和护林工作结合起来，那里的山火已经基本上消灭了。
    在人烟稀少、交通不便的大面积国有林区中，应该根据实际需要，建立和健全必要的森林经营机构，加强防火设施，使森林资源尽快地由专门机构和专人负责管理起来。南方私有林区原有雇请看山员护林的习惯，在对林农有利和群众自愿的原则下，可以继续实行。但是，不论那种地区，都不能因为建立专业机构而放松群众护林防火的组织工作。只有把群众的护林防火积极性和专门机构的组织领导有效地结合起来，才能把护林防火工作真正做好。
