    Hainan Island on the Eve of Comprehensive Development
    Chen Jun
    When Hainan Island is mentioned, people think of: the glorious revolutionary history of its people, who persisted in fighting on the isolated island for more than 20 years; the area where ethnic minorities live, where the work of the Li and Miao Autonomous Region has developed rapidly in recent years; and the southern shield of the motherland, the defense frontier. However, many people are not familiar enough with its position in the country's socialist construction.

    Hainan Island is rich in tropical resources and is suitable for the development of dozens of tropical cash crops. Among them are strategic materials for national defense and fiber crops: rubber, sisal, Manila hemp, ramie, Sea Island cotton, Java kapok; valuable oil crops: coconut, oil palm, castor bean, Calophyllum inophyllum; important medicinal materials, beverages, and spices: quinine, betel nut, agarwood, coffee, cocoa, pepper, citronella; and delicious fruits: coconut, pineapple, mango, banana. There are also many precious woods. It is a major fish and salt production area. The Beibu Gulf in the west is one of the world's four major fishing grounds, and the Yinggehai Salt Field can produce 500,000 tons annually. The island also has rich iron ore with a grade of up to 60% to 70%, as well as various non-ferrous metals and crystal mines. Hainan Island is not only our country's only tropical land, but also one of the few such lands in the socialist camp. We have a responsibility to make full use of every inch of its land.

    Tropical regions have many good conditions, but it is not possible to obtain everything needed from nature without paying a huge price. Natural disasters and the reactionary rule of past dynasties have long plagued Hainan Island. According to the "History of Meteorology and Earthquakes in Guangdong," Hainan Island suffered 136 disasters such as strong winds, floods, and severe droughts between 1420 and 1860, the longest drought lasting 11 months. The rulers of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties launched more than a dozen military campaigns against the people of Hainan Island, one of which lasted 60 years. Natural and man-made disasters turned the treasure island into what the rulers called a "den of insects and snakes." The Tang dynasty poet Li Deyu wrote: "Where is Yazhou? You must cross the Gates of Hell to get there." Hainan Island became a prison for exiling criminals. The Song dynasty poet Su Dongpo was banished to Haikou after offending the authorities. With the victory of the people's revolution, "man-made disasters" have been eliminated on Hainan Island, but if we want to extract treasures from this "evergreen treasure island," we still face a fierce struggle with nature.

    According to the climate of Hainan Island, the average temperature in the coldest month of January rarely falls below 10 degrees Celsius throughout the region; and in the hottest month of July, the average temperature rarely exceeds 34 degrees Celsius. Only the absolute maximum temperatures in Lingao and Qiongshan counties have reached around 41 degrees Celsius. The influence of the sea breeze makes the summer there less hot than on the mainland. Therefore, it is suitable for the growth of crops. Rice can be planted in all four seasons, and miscellaneous grains such as sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, and beans can be harvested three times a year. However, currently, the multiple cropping area of cultivated land on Hainan Island is less than half, and the yield per unit area of cultivated land is also relatively low, with rice and sweet potatoes (converted to grain) only between 160 and 166 jin. The grain produced from the region's more than 5 million mu of cultivated land is not enough to supply the needs of the 2.7 million population. To transport grain to supply Hainan Island, the state has to bear a cost of 3 million yuan a year. This is caused by many other natural conditions and historical circumstances.

    Purely from a quantitative point of view, Hainan Island is not short of water. The average annual rainfall in the region is nearly 1,700 mm. The annual rainfall is estimated to be 30 billion tons. If all the arable land in the region is cultivated, only 3 billion tons of water would be enough. However, there are droughts every year. The rainfall on the island is extremely unevenly distributed geographically and seasonally. In addition, the rivers all originate in the central mountains and flow into the sea from all directions, with steep slopes, short rivers, and rapid discharge. When there is heavy rain, there are floods; when there is no rain, there are droughts. The early-season rice fields of Hainan Island are generally planted before the Spring Festival. Planting so early is not conducive to the growth of rice and may be hit by cold air from the north. However, after this time, the water accumulated in the autumn dries up and flows away, and after the Spring Festival, rice seedlings cannot be planted.

    The typhoon season in Hainan Island is particularly long (May to November). In the recent 50 years, it has been hit by an average of 4 to 5 typhoons per year. In 1910, it was hit by 10 typhoons. Typhoons can bring rain, which is still essential for Hainan Island, which often suffers from droughts; in general, typhoons below level 8 are more beneficial than harmful, while those above level 10 can cause disasters.

    After the liberation of Hainan Island, the Party led the people of the region to carry out land reform and develop production, especially to wage a tenacious struggle against wind and drought disasters. In 1955 alone, the people of Hainan Island went through a tense struggle against a drought that lasted for 8 months and a level 12 typhoon. In the area of water conservancy alone, by the first half of 1955, more than 25,000 projects had been built, irrigating nearly 800,000 mu. Grain production increased year by year, with the total output in 1954 reaching 1.46 billion jin, an increase of 49% compared to before the Anti-Japanese War (1936). In 1955, a high tide of cooperation also appeared in the Han areas, which account for more than 80% of the region's population, with the development of nearly 10,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives. The minority ethnic areas also took on a new look, and the backward slash-and-burn farming methods were rarely seen. Chairman Mao's instructions on carrying out comprehensive planning and accelerating socialist construction gave the people of Hainan Island new strength. Hainan Island is already on the eve of comprehensive development.

    In the matter of developing Hainan Island, there have been twists and turns in recent years.

    The reporter visited the state-owned Fushan Farm in Chengmai County. The predecessor of this farm was an agricultural machinery station belonging to the Guangdong Provincial Reclamation Bureau. In the first two years of its establishment, it reclaimed some wasteland and tried to plant some tropical cash crops. Due to some technical problems and natural conditions, it failed. Unfortunately, the lessons of failure were not seriously learned at the time, and the blame was placed on the natural conditions of "high mountains, barren land, strong winds, and little water." Therefore, it was decided to abolish this station. At this time, the Party corrected these short-sighted pessimists and pointed out that it should and could continue to operate. But how to continue? The people involved were confused. What crops can be developed in such an area? At this time, the previous secretary of the Hainan District Party Committee came. He, along with the leading staff of the agricultural machinery station, visited the local farmers. They quickly discovered that near the agricultural machinery station, there were famous coffee gardens on the island, citronella gardens specially set up by a Shanghai chemical company, and also a private sisal garden. Coffee is an important beverage; sisal is a hard fiber crop that is resistant to corrosion, alkali, abrasion, has strong tensile strength, and does not expand or contract much under changes in dry and wet conditions. It has a wide range of uses and high economic value and is listed as a strategic material under embargo by American imperialism. Citronella is an important raw material for extracting fragrances. Investigation and research, and learning from the masses, made the reclamation workers understand that they must adopt a reclamation policy that suits local conditions. The farm was established in 1954 and focused on operating sisal, coffee, and citronella, while also engaging in other agricultural crops. In the second year of its establishment (1955), the farm's income and expenditure were already balanced, and it is expected that it can make a profit of 150,000 to 200,000 yuan in 1956. The development of Fushan Farm shows the unlimited prospects for the development of tropical cash crops on Hainan Island.

    The reporter also went to Duowen Township in Lingao County. The Duowen Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in this township was established in 1954. The members were 46 poor and middle peasants, with 393 mu of cultivated land. In the spring of 1955, they overcame drought, wind, and insect disasters, overcame conservative thinking, and initially carried out a series of technical reforms and built water conservancy projects. They created the highest yield per unit area in the region. In 1955, they harvested a total of 180,092 jin of rice in the early and late seasons, an increase of 58% compared to 1954. Among them, the 63 mu of high-yield fields in the late season achieved a yield of 640 jin per unit area. The highest-yielding 1.27 mu of high-yield fields in the cooperative achieved a harvest of 1,568.7 jin per mu in two seasons. In late December last year, the cooperative was busy accumulating fertilizer and repairing irrigation canals. A paddy field prepared to be converted from double cropping to triple cropping has already been plowed and is about to be planted. The fact that Duowen Cooperative increased production greatly encouraged the confidence of agricultural cooperatives throughout the region to carry out the "thousand-jin mu," "thousand-jin cooperative," and "thousand-jin township" movement. The potential of agriculture on Hainan Island is also unlimited.

    The Hainan District Party Committee has initially determined the policy for developing Hainan Island: on the basis of self-sufficiency in grain with a slight surplus, with state-owned farms taking the lead and agricultural producers' cooperatives as the foundation, to maximize the development of tropical cash crops. Of the island's 50 million mu of land, one-third of the arable land will be fully utilized to develop cash crops and grain, and the rest will be used for afforestation. In order to achieve this development plan, in addition to the widespread use of agricultural machinery, at least 1.4 million people need to be moved in. A comprehensive and large-scale survey has already begun in December 1955, and a preliminary plan for the comprehensive, all-round, and long-term development of Hainan Island is to be drawn up within 4 months. This is an unprecedented event for Hainan Island. The District Party Committee regards this work as the most important task, and will further mobilize and organize the people of the region to overcome all difficulties and conquer nature. By the end of the second and third five-year plans, large and small water conservancy projects will store hundreds of millions of tons of water, fundamentally eliminating drought and flood disasters! Coastal protection forests, water source forests, and farmland protection forests will form a well-organized protection forest network of more than 30 million mu, which will prevent typhoons from sweeping thousands of miles at will! Sisal gardens, coffee gardens, coconut gardens, and sugarcane fields will be all over the island! Millions of mu of fertile land will be harvested three times a year, making the best use of the land! With the development of tropical cash crops, it is conceivable that Hainan Island's industry, transportation, culture, health, and domestic and foreign trade will all have corresponding developments. Hainan Island will become a base for tropical cash crops, a base for fisheries and salt industry, and also one of the raw material bases for heavy industry. The plan for the comprehensive development of Hainan Island will find a source of happiness for the people of Hainan Island. (Attached picture)

    全面开发前夕的海南岛
    陈浚
    一提起海南岛，人们就会想到：那里的人民有过光荣的革命历史，曾在孤岛上坚持斗争20多年；那里是少数民族聚居的地区，几年来，黎族苗族自治区的工作发展很快；那里是祖国南方的屏障，国防前线。可是，许多人对于它在国家进行社会主义建设中所处的地位，还是不够熟悉的。
    海南岛蕴藏着丰富的热带资源，宜于发展几十种热带经济作物。其中有国防的战略物资和纤维作物：橡胶、剑麻、蕉麻、番麻、海岛棉、爪哇木棉；有贵重的油料作物：椰子、油棕、蓖麻、油海棠；有重要的药材、饮料和香料：奎宁、槟榔、沉香、咖啡、可可、胡椒、香茅草；有鲜美的果品，椰子、菠萝、芒果、香蕉。还有许多珍贵的木材，那里是鱼盐的盛产地，西边的北部湾是世界四大鱼场之一，莺哥湾盐场可年产50万吨。岛上也有品位高达60％到70％的富铁矿，多种有色金属和水晶矿。海南岛不只是我国唯一的一块热带土地，并且也是目前社会主义阵营中一块少有的土地。我们有责任充分利用它的每一寸土地。
    热带地区有许多好条件，但是，并不是可以不用巨大的代价，垂手向大自然取得所需要的一切。自然灾害和历代反动的统治，长期折磨着海南岛。据“广东气象、地震史”记载，从1420年到1860年之间，海南岛曾遭到大风、大水、大旱等灾害136次，最大的一次旱灾持续了11个月。元、明、清三代的统治者，对海南岛人民大举用兵十几次，有一次战争持续60年。天灾人祸，使宝岛变成统治者们所说的“虫蛇之穴”。唐朝诗人李德裕的诗写过：“崖州在何处？生渡鬼门关。”海南岛成为一个流放罪犯的监狱，宋朝诗人苏东坡得罪以后，就被放逐到海口。随着人民革命的胜利，海南岛上已经消灭了“人祸”，可是要想从这个“常绿宝岛”里取出百宝来，我们面前还有着同大自然的一场激烈斗争。
    按照海南岛的气候来说，冬季最冷的1月份，全区各地平均温度很少到摄氏10度以下的；而夏季最热的7月份，平均温度也很少有超过34度的，只有临高和琼山两县的绝对最高温度，才到过41度上下。海风的影响，使那里暑天并不比大陆炎热。因此，这里适宜於农作物的生长。水稻四季可种，甘薯、玉米、高粱、豆类等杂粮，一年可以三熟。但是，到目前，海南岛耕地的复种面积不到一半，而耕地的单位面积产量也比较低，水稻和甘薯（折谷计算）都只在160斤到166斤之间。全区500多万亩耕地产的粮食，还不足以供应270万人口的需要。为了调运粮食供应海南岛，国家一年要担负300万元的费用。这是别的许多自然条件和历史情况所造成的。
    单纯从数量上来看，海南岛是不缺水的。全区全年平均降雨量近1，700公厘。一年的雨量估计有300亿吨。全区可耕地都开垦起来，只要30亿吨水就够用了。但是，这里年年闹旱灾。岛上雨量在地区和季节上分布极不平衡，加上河流都是发源在中部山地，从四面八方泄入大海，坡度大，河流短，入海快，下了大雨就闹水灾；不下雨，就闹旱灾。海南岛的早造田，一般都在春节前插完秧，这样早插秧。对稻子生长并不利，可能遭到北方寒流的袭击，但是过了这个时候，秋季积下来的水干涸了，流尽了，过了春节，就会插不上秧。
    海南岛的台风季节特别长（5月到11月）。最近的50年里，每年平均遭到台风袭击4次到5次。1910年就遭到10次台风。台风能带来雨，对于常闹旱灾的海南岛，还是不可少的；一般的，8级以下的台风，利多害少，10级以上的，就会造成灾害。
    海南岛解放以后，党领导全区人民进行了土地改革，发展生产，尤其是同风灾、旱灾进行了顽强的斗争；1955年，海南岛人民就是在同延续8个月的旱灾和一次12级的台风的紧张斗争中过来的。单是水利一项，到1955年上半年为止，就兴修25，000多宗，可以灌溉近80万亩。粮食产量逐年增加，1954年的总产量达到14.6亿斤，比抗日战争以前（1936年）增加49％。1955年，在占全区人口总数80％以上的汉族区，又出现了合作化的高潮，农业生产合作社发展到近1万个，少数民族地区，也面貌一新，那种刀耕火种的落后耕作方式，已经快看不到了。毛主席关于进行全面规划，加快进行社会主义建设的指示，给予海南岛人民以新的力量，海南岛已经处在进行全面开发的前夕。
    在开发海南岛的问题上，几年来，并不是没有过曲折的。
    记者访问了设在澄迈县的一个国营福山农场。这个农场的前身是属于广东省垦殖局的一个农业机器站。建站的头两年，曾在这里开了荒，试种过一些热带经济作物。由于一些技术问题和自然条件，遭到了失败。可惜，当时并没有认真接受失败的教训，却把过错都记到“山高、地瘠、风大、水少”的自然条件的账上，于是，决定要把这个站撤销。在这个时候，党纠正了这种没有远见的悲观论者，指出了应该而且可能继续办下去。究竟怎么办下去呢？当事的人思想上是混乱的。在这样的地区能发展什么作物呢？在这个时候，中共海南区党委的前一任书记来了。他同农业机器站的领导工作人员一起访问了当地的农民。他们很快地发现了就在农业机器站的附近，有全岛著名的咖啡园，有上海一个化学公司专设的香茅园，也有一个私人的剑麻园。咖啡是重要的饮料；剑麻是耐腐、耐碱、耐磨擦、拉力强并且在干湿情况变化下伸缩不大的硬质纤维作物，用途广，经济价值高，被美帝国主义列为禁运物资的战略物资，香茅是提炼香料的重要原料。调查研究，向群众学习，使垦殖工作人员懂得了必须采取因地制宜的垦殖方针。1954年这个农场建立起来，就以经营剑麻、咖啡和香茅草为主，兼营其他农作物。建场的第二年（1955年）农场的收支已经相抵，预计1956年就可以获利15万到20万元。福山农场的发展显示了海南岛热带经济作物发展的无限前途。
    记者也到了临高县多文乡。这个乡的多文农业生产合作社是1954年建立的。社员是46户贫农和中农，耕地393亩。1955年春季，战胜了旱灾、风灾和虫灾，战胜了保守思想，初步进行了一系列的技术改革，兴修了水利。他们创造了全区最高的单位面积产量。1955年早晚两造共收了180，092斤稻谷，比1954年增产58％。其中晚造的63亩丰产田，单位面积产量达到640斤。社里产量最高的一块1.27亩的丰产田，两造的收成达到每亩1，568.7斤。去年12月下旬，社里已在忙着积肥、修水渠。一块准备由双造改三造的水田，已经犁过，就要插秧。多文社增产的事实，大大鼓舞了全区农业社开展千斤亩、千斤社、千斤乡运动的信心。海南岛农业的潜力也是无限的。
    中共海南区党委已经初步确定了开发海南岛的方针：在粮食自给略有敷余的基础上，以国营农场带头，农业生产合作社为基础，最大限度地发展热带经济作物。在全岛5，000万亩土地上，要充分利用其中三分之一的可耕土地发展经济作物和粮食，其余的植树造林。为了实现这个开发计划，除了广泛使用农业机器以外，至少还要移入140万人。全面的大规模的勘察工作，已经从1955年12月开始了，要在4个月内拟订出综合、全面、长期开发海南岛的初步规划。这是海南岛空前的大事。区党委把这一个工作当成了最重要的工作任务，并且要进一步动员和组织全区人民，克服一切困难，来战胜自然。在第二个、第三个五年计划结束的时候，大大小小的水利工程，把成亿吨的水拦蓄下来，从根本消灭旱灾和水灾！海岸防护林、水源林、农田防护林，将组成3，000多万亩的严整的防护林网，会使横扫千里的台风不得任性！将使剑麻园、咖啡园、椰子园、甘蔗田遍布全岛！将使千万亩良田一年三熟，地尽其利！随着热带经济作物的发展，可以想见，海南岛的工业、交通运输业、文化卫生事业，以及海内外贸易，都将有相应的发展。海南岛将成为热带经济作物的基地，渔业和盐业的基地，也将是重工业的原料基地之一。海南岛全面开发的规划，将为海南岛人民找到幸福的源泉。（附图片）
