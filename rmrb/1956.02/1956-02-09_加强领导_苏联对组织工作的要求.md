Strengthening Leadership
—Soviet Requirements for Organizational Work—
By Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He

I.

The change in the leadership style of Novikov, the director of the Abashev No. 1 Coal Mine in Kuzbass, has brought a new atmosphere to the mine.

Previously, the labor organization conditions in this coal mine could not guarantee the maintenance of machinery. The workers taking over the shifts did not care about the wear and tear of the combined coal mining machine and were eager to complete the task and continue to use it until it was completely unusable. As a result, coal mining was often interrupted. Novikov used to be in the habit of issuing instructions, but the instructions could not reverse this situation, which made all employees uneasy. Later, he relied on the strength of the collective, listened to the opinions of the Party organization, and discovered a way to solve the problem. At production meetings and Party meetings, it was proposed that necessary time should be set aside for machinery maintenance. This led to a bold plan: to change from non-stop coal mining day and night to intermittent coal mining. Novikov, together with technicians and production innovators, studied this suggestion in detail and formulated implementation measures. It was stipulated that Sunday would be "Maintenance Day" for careful repair of coal mining equipment and underground transportation. As a result, the daily coal production increased by 23.7%, labor productivity increased by 6%, the cost per ton of coal decreased by 5%, and labor discipline also improved. Novikov was not complacent with his achievements. He went deep into the coal face, exchanged opinions with the miners, and saw the necessity of reorganizing the original separate coal miners, coal pickers, and blasters into comprehensive groups. After the reorganization, many groups had workers of several specializations, which facilitated mutual substitution and thus increased the sense of responsibility for the work at the coal face. The coal mine has overfulfilled its daily production plan year after year, and the organizational talent of the coal mine director has also developed day by day. He often goes to the work sections and the coal face, paying attention to everything, supporting this, persuading that, and correcting mistakes. He patiently teaches young engineers and technicians, enabling them to quickly grow into capable assistants.

The local Soviet Communist Party Municipal Committee organized a study of the leadership experience of this coal mine. People paid attention to the methods of labor organization under specific conditions and attached even greater importance to Novikov's leadership style.

Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, Party organizations, state organs, and industrial and agricultural economic departments have been continuously improving their leadership work for several years. The situation at the Abashev No. 1 Coal Mine mentioned above is just one example of the countless units that are improving leadership. Strengthening leadership—this is what the Soviet Communist Party has repeatedly emphasized in the past three years. Several plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party have stressed that the key to the development of all tasks in communist construction, the key to the new upsurge in various sectors of the national economy, lies in strengthening leadership. Recently, at the Soviet Communist Party's representative conferences at all levels in preparation for the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, many experiences and lessons regarding the strengthening of specific leadership were summarized. When re-electing Party committee institutions at all levels, many people who are good at organizational work and good at specific leadership were elected, and those who were detached from the masses and only capable of "general" leadership were criticized and replaced.

II.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Communist Party has made great achievements in thoroughly implementing the principle of collective leadership in Party organizations at all levels in the past three years. Collectivity is the highest principle of Party leadership. It stems from the democratic nature of the Communist Party—a voluntary fighting alliance of Communists with unified ideology. Collective leadership, which embodies comprehensive wisdom, is the most important condition for Party organs to work well and lead correctly. Party organizations at all levels of the Soviet Communist Party have more strictly abided by the requirements in the Party Constitution regarding democratic life within the Party: holding regular meetings of Party committees, conferences of Party activists in districts and cities, and branch meetings.

The facts reflected in Party representative conferences at all levels show that the principle of collective leadership is being strictly observed. The work of the Yergavsk District Committee of the Latvian Communist Party is one example. In this district committee, all important political and economic issues are not decided by the secretary alone; they are submitted to the regularly held district standing committees, district committee plenary sessions, and Party activist conferences for decision. The district standing committee meets twice a month, each time resolving two or three issues. The standing committee studies the draft decisions and other materials in advance. Before deciding on an issue, in addition to the opinions of Party organ staff, the opinions of district activists, administrative and economic cadres, advanced farmers, and agricultural experts are collected. The two secretaries of the district committee always consult with experts and non-Party activists in relevant departments before discussing a certain issue in a meeting. The district committee is willing to listen to the criticisms of Party members and the masses and is willing to find ways to implement people's suggestions. Members of the district committee often help grassroots organizations implement the decisions of the district committee.

Although violations of the principle of collective leadership are becoming increasingly rare, the Soviet Communist Party continues to prevent anything that deviates even slightly from this principle with sharp eyes and severe criticism. Party meetings and publications have recently criticized the following points: (1) Individual district committees use the excuse of opposing "meeting busy-ness" to not hold Party committee plenary sessions on schedule and to not convene Party activist conferences for a long time. (2) Individual district and city Party secretaries do not submit their reports to the district standing committee for discussion before presenting them to the district committee plenary session and activist conference. Individual district and city Party secretaries believe that only they can speak reasonably and are unwilling to listen to the opinions of other committee members. Collective leadership requires Party workers to have the quality of subordinating personal will to collective will. (3) Some Party committee meetings, Party committee plenary sessions, Party activist conferences, and Party member meetings are not prepared in advance, there is no criticism and self-criticism at the meetings, and members of the standing committee do not know the meeting materials in advance, causing the meetings to become mere formalities. (4) Some Party workers have not recognized that collective leadership is not limited to collectively discussing and deciding things, but also ensuring the implementation of these decisions. Collective leadership is combined with individual responsibility for the work undertaken and flexible handling (although some issues cannot be decided by individuals and must be discussed collectively).

Another achievement of Soviet organizational work in recent years is the continuous improvement of the work of Party and government organs. The measures taken by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party to eliminate the bureaucratic style of work in Party and government organs have played a huge role. Particularly noteworthy is the resolute streamlining of institutions. According to the resolution of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party on January 25, 1954, a general streamlining of organs throughout the Soviet Union was carried out. In Georgia, 4,600 administrative staff were streamlined, and in Moldova, more than 70 redundant institutions were abolished, thereby streamlining more than 3,600 people, and these are relatively small member republics. After the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party in July 1955, Party organizations in various localities paid more attention to the leadership of industry and found that many organs could be further streamlined. For example, in the Kyrgyz Republic, more than 80 economic organs were abolished, thereby streamlining 32,700 people, but in the local and fuel industry systems, the personnel of administrative organs still accounted for 11% of the total personnel of the system. The streamlining of all-Soviet organs has already brought many benefits: the expenses of management organs have been reduced; a large number of staff, including many experienced and knowledgeable people, have directly participated in production; the phenomenon of focusing cadre forces on issuing instructions, drafting resolutions, and writing reports has been reduced, and the work efficiency of organs has been improved. Party representative conferences at all levels of the Soviet Communist Party have called for further improvement of the work of organs, enhancing the sense of responsibility of organ staff and their organizational role.

The reorganization of Soviet Party, Soviet, and agricultural institutions, their closeness to production, and the increase in their responsibilities for agricultural enterprises and local economic and cultural affairs are all of great significance. It is well known that the secretaries of rural Party district committees live in machine tractor stations with working groups to conduct specific guidance on the spot, many Party committees are led by the first secretary to manage agriculture, and the Party has strengthened its leadership over agriculture. The Party's leadership over industry has also been strengthened. Podgorny, one of the secretaries of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party, said when summarizing the experience of the Party's leadership over industry: "Many things in leading industry depend on the direct organizational work of the Party district committees, city committees, and state committees. The responsibility of the Party committees for the industrial situation has greatly increased recently. Now it is no longer heard that Party workers discuss as they did before, saying that industry has departments, bureaus, offices, and experienced economic cadres, and does not need Party leadership. Now state committees, city committees, and district committees have improved their leadership over industry." Now the Party district committees and city committees are in charge of the work of all local enterprises and organizations, whether they are local or all-Soviet. The benefits of Party committees at all levels intervening in industry are great. According to the suggestions of Party committees in various localities, the planning organs of the Ukrainian Republic have made comprehensive plans for the specialization and expansion of cooperation of 118 machine manufacturing plants and 14 steel plants and their departmental enterprises within Ukraine that belong to the all-Soviet Union.

III.

In the past few years, the Soviet Communist Party has formulated a huge program for the rapid development of agriculture and industry, not generally, but dramatically. Now the unprecedentedly large-scale Sixth Five-Year Plan has been born. The objective situation requires strengthening organizational work. After the route has been decided and the plan has been made, it is necessary to rely on organizational work to ensure its implementation. It is not accidental that no Party representative conference at any level of the Soviet Communist Party did not focus on discussing organizational work.

The conferences in various localities reflected that the objective conditions of many factories and farms, districts, and states are the same, but the results of the work are very different. Why? Because the work style of the Party committees is different: some abide by the requirements of the Party and implement specific leadership with familiarity with the business; others maintain the "general" leadership that is divorced from reality. The Chastavnov District and the Shatgorsk District in the Chernovitz State of Ukraine are adjacent to each other. The Chastavnov District was originally a backward district, but last year it ranked first in the state: crops were abundant, and each cow averaged 3,069 kilograms of milk. This is primarily because the Party district committee abandoned the "general" leadership method, ended the state of busy-ness with meetings and many instructions, and went deep into practice. The district committee secretaries and instructors carefully studied agriculture and advanced experiences, and organized the study of collective farm chairmen, tractor station staff, and agricultural technicians. At the beginning of each month, farmers visited excellent farms. Collective farm chairmen visited advanced farms in neighboring districts to learn from their experiences. Collective farm chairmen and agricultural technicians often consulted with the district committee secretary, Makitonsky, and he always gave specific and practical advice. Makitonsky himself also insisted on learning, read a lot of books, and often asked ordinary farmers for advice. Other members of the district committee followed his example. The Shatgorsk District, although its soil, cattle breeds, and other conditions were the same as its neighboring district, was much less productive last year, and its milk production was half as low. The main reason is that the Party district committee's work is still the old way, still replacing specific leadership of collective farms with empty meetings and instructions.

Soviet Communist Party organizations at all levels are increasingly strengthening leadership and achieving more and more results. However, the general and non-specific leadership, which therefore cannot solve practical problems and help work, the Party representative conferences at all levels pointed out that this is a more common shortcoming that has not yet been completely overcome. It is manifested in the following aspects:

(1) Some Party workers often want to lead the rapid development of construction with empty meetings, resolutions, and instructions. Some staff members of the Gorky State Party Committee and the Soviet Executive Committee judge the quality of their work based on the number of resolutions of the Party district committee and the district Soviet Executive Committee. A district committee in this state wanted to eliminate the backwardness of collective farms and made about 100 resolutions in a short period of time. The standing committee of this district committee listened to the reports of the collective farm chairmen five times, with 39 people reporting each time, and most of the collective farm chairmen were punished. But the work of the collective farm was not improved.

(2) Some Party workers spend more time sitting in the office and rarely go down to the masses. Even if they go down, they do not like to consult with the masses and do not carefully discover problems. Semen, the former state committee secretary of Vologda State, had not visited more than half of the districts in the three years of his tenure. Gnushkov, the first secretary of the Kemirovo City Committee, walked around the factory and mining site and left. He only talked to the leaders of the enterprises, rarely contacted the masses, so the city committee could not easily discover the shortcomings in the work of the enterprises.

(3) Some Party workers are accustomed to judging the situation based on reports, forms, and average figures. They do not go deep into practice to study the specific situation and potential strength of each locality, each factory, and each farm, nor do they learn the necessary industrial and agricultural economic and technical knowledge, so they cannot achieve informed and effective leadership. In the Stalin District of Karaganda State, the leaders of a mine reported four times in nine months last year. The district committee, the city committee, and the state committee all discussed the problem of overcoming the backward production of this mine. But because only general instructions such as "improve work" and "strengthen political work" were made, it did not help the matter. Shvetsov, the district committee secretary of the Spakov District in the Stavropol Border Region stationed at the tractor station, lacked basic agricultural knowledge. When people asked him what kind of seeds the farm wanted to sow, he replied, "Corn is yellow, sunflowers are black." Due to the lack of agricultural knowledge, he was unable to ensure that collective farms did not have problems that affected production, such as improper seed selection.

Party representative conferences at all levels of the Soviet Communist Party took up the sharp weapon of criticism and self-criticism to overcome these shortcomings. Because these workers' leadership methods, which are divorced from reality, have nothing in common with the Soviet Communist Party's traditional leadership style of connecting with the masses. Because the generalized leadership method violates the spirit of the plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party in January and July 1955. The January plenary session required local Party and government workers to go deep into all aspects of agricultural production and lead collective farms and state farms specifically and with familiarity with the business. The July plenary session required Party and government workers to focus their main efforts on organizing production, carefully study the work of various industrial enterprises, deeply understand production technology and economy, support new things and new technologies, and conduct specific leadership of industry.

    加强领导
    ——苏联对组织工作的要求——
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    一
    煤井主任诺维科夫领导作风的改变，给在库兹巴斯的阿巴舍夫第一号煤井带来了新的气象。
    这个煤井在原先的劳动组织条件不能保证养护机器。接班的工人不关心联合采煤机损耗的情形，而急于完成任务，继续使用它，直到完全不能再用为止。这样，采煤工作时常中断。诺维科夫以前习惯于颁发指令，但指令不能扭转这种使全体职工不安的情况。后来他依靠集体的力量，听取党组织的意见，发现了解决问题的方法。在生产会议和党的会议上人们提议过：要划出必要时间来养护机器。这样产生了勇敢的方案——变昼夜不停地采煤为有间歇地采煤。诺维科夫同技术人员和生产革新者们一起详细地研究了这个建议，制定了实行的办法。规定以星期天为“检修日”，对采煤设备和地下运输进行仔细的修理。结果，每昼夜产煤量增加23.7％，劳动生产率提高6％，一吨煤的成本降低5％，劳动纪律也改进了。诺维科夫没有以自己的成绩自满。他深入掌子，和采煤工交换了意见，看到了必须把原来各管各的采煤工、拣煤工、放炮工改编为综合组。改编以后，许多组都有几种专业工人，便于互替，因而提高了对掌子工作的责任心。煤井成年累月超额地完成每昼夜生产计划，煤井主任的组织才干也一天天发展起来。他经常到工段去，到掌子去，什么都留心，支持这个，说服那个，纠正毛病。他耐心地教导青年工程师、技师，使他们很快地成长为有力的助手。
    当地苏共市委会组织了对这个煤井的领导经验的研究。人们注意在具体条件下的劳动组织方法，更重视诺维科夫的领导作风。
    在苏共中央的领导下，党的组织、国家机关和工农业经济部门几年来都不断地改进着领导工作，上面所说的阿巴舍夫第一号煤井的情况，就是改进领导的无数单位中的一个例子。加强领导，——这是最近3年来苏联共产党一再强调的。苏共中央多次全会都着重指出了，共产主义建设各项工作发展的关键，组织国民经济各个部门新高涨的关键，在于加强领导。最近在迎接苏共二十次代表大会的苏共各级代表会议上，总结了许多关于加强具体领导的经验和教训，在改选各级党委机构的时候，选举了许多善于进行组织工作，善于进行具体领导的人们，批评和撤换了那些脱离群众，只会“一般”领导的人物。
    二
    大家知道，苏联共产党最近3年来在各级党组织中彻底实现集体领导的原则上取得巨大的成就。集体性是党的领导的最高原则。它根源于共产党——思想统一的共产党人的自愿的战斗联盟——的民主性质。体现着全面智慧的集体领导，是党的机构工作得好和领导正确的最重要条件。苏共各级党组织更加严格地遵守了党章中关于党内民主生活的要求：定期举行党委全体会议，区和市的党积极分子大会，支部大会。
    在各级党代表会议上反映的事实说明，集体领导的原则被严格地遵守着。拉脱维亚共产党叶尔加夫斯克区委会的工作便是一个例子。在这个区委会中，一切重要的政治和经济问题都不是由书记决定的，它们提交定期举行的区常委会，区委全会，党的积极分子大会决定。区常委会每月举行两次，每次解决两三个问题。常委预先研究了决定的草案和其他材料。在决定问题之前，除了党机关工作人员的意见以外，还收集区的积极分子、行政和经济干部、先进庄员、农业专家的意见。区委两个书记在开会讨论某个问题之前总是先和有关部门的专家和非党积极分子商量。区委会肯倾听党员和群众的批评，肯想法实现人们的建议。区委会委员们经常帮助基层组织实现区委的决定。
    尽管违反集体领导原则的现象越来越少见了，苏联共产党继续以锐利的眼光和严厉的批评防止任何稍许离开这个原则的事情的发生。党的会议和刊物在最近时期批评了如下几点：（一）个别区委会借口反对“会议忙”而不按期举行党委全体会议和长期不召开党的积极分子大会。（二）个别区、市委书记向区委全会和积极分子大会作报告以前，没有把报告拿到区常委会上讨论。个别区、市委书记自以为只有他能够谈出道理，不愿意倾听其他委员的意见。而集体领导要求党的工作人员具有使个人意志服从集体意志的品质。（三）有些党委会议、党委全会、党的积极分子大会和党员大会事前没有准备，会上没有批评和自我批评，常委委员预先不知道会议材料，使会议流为形式。（四）某些党的工作人员没有认清集体领导不限于集体地讨论和决定事情，还要保证这些决定的实现，集体领导是同各人对所担承的工作的个人负责和灵活处理相结合的（虽然有些问题是不能由个人决定而必须经过集体讨论的）。
    最近几年苏联组织工作的另一件成就是党政机关工作的不断改进。苏共中央关于消灭在党政机关工作中文牍主义作风的措施起了巨大作用。特别令人注目的是机构的坚决精简。根据1954年1月25日苏共中央的决议，苏联全国机关普遍进行了精简。在格鲁吉亚精简了4，600行政工作人员，在摩尔达维亚撤销了70个多余机构，因而精简了3，600多人，而它们都是较小的加盟共和国。在1955年7月苏共中央全会以后，各地党组织更加留心工业的领导问题，发现许多机关还可以进一步精简。例如，在吉尔吉斯共和国曾经撤销了80多个经济机关，因而精简32，7000人，但是在地方和燃料工业系统中行政管理机关的人员还占整个系统人员的11％。全苏机关的精简已经带来了许多好处：管理机关的开支减少了；大批工作人员，包括许多有经验有知识的人员，直接参加了生产；把干部力量重心摆在发指令、拟决议、写报告的现象减少了，机关的工作效率提高了。苏共各级代表会议要求进一步改进机关的工作，提高机关工作人员的责任心和他们的组织作用。
    苏联党的、苏维埃的和农业的机构的改组，它们的接近生产，它们对农业企业和地方经济文化所负的责任的提高，都有重要的意义。农村党区委书记带着工作组住在机器拖拉机站就地进行具体指导，许多党委由第一书记领导农业，党加强对农业的领导，这些是大家都知道的。党对工业的领导也加强了。乌克兰共产党中央书记之一波德高尔雷在总结党对工业的领导经验时说：“领导工业的许多事情决定于党区委会、市委会和州委会的直接的组织工作。党委对工业情况的责任最近大大提高了。现在已经没有听见党的工作人员像以前那样议论了，以前说工业有部、局、处和有经验的经济干部，不需要党的领导。现在州委会、市委会和区委会改进了对工业的领导。”现在党区委会和市委会要管当地所有企业和组织的工作，不论它们是地方的还是全苏的。各级党委会过问工业的好处很大。乌克兰共和国计划机关根据各地党委的建议，对于在乌克兰境内属于全苏的118座机器制造厂以及14座钢铁厂及其部门的企业的专业化和协作的扩大，作出了全面规划。
    三
    苏联共产党这几年中制定了不是一般地而是急剧地发展农业和工业的巨大纲领。现在空前大规模的第六个五年计划诞生了。客观形势要求加强组织工作。在路线已经决定，计划已经制出以后，要靠组织工作保证它的实现。不是偶然的，苏共各级代表会议没有一个不着重讨论了组织工作。
    各地会议反映了不少工厂和农庄、区、州的客观条件相同，可是工作的成绩大不一样。为什么？因为党委的工作作风不一样：有的遵守党的要求，实现了熟悉业务的具体的领导；有的却保持了脱离实际的“一般”领导。乌克兰车尔诺维茨州的查斯塔甫诺夫区和沙特高尔区是毗邻的。查斯塔甫诺夫区本是落后区，去年在全州却占了第一位：农作物丰产，每头母牛平均挤了3，069公斤牛奶。这首先因为党区委会抛弃了“一般”领导方法，结束了会议忙和指令多的状态，深入到实际中去。区委书记和指导员们认真地研究了农业和先进经验，组织了集体农庄主席、拖拉机站工作人员和农业技术人员的学习。每月月初庄员们到优秀的农庄去参观。农庄主席们到邻区先进农庄访问经验。农庄主席、农业技术人员常和区委书记马其顿斯基商量事情，而他总是给以具体的实际的意见。马其顿斯基自己也坚持学习，读书很多，常向普通庄员们请教。区委会其他人员都学他的榜样。沙特高尔区虽然在土壤、牛的品种等等条件上都和自己的邻区一样，但去年生产落后得多，牛奶产量低一半。主要原因是党区委会工作还是老一套，还是以空泛的会议和指令代替对农庄的具体领导。
    苏共各级组织越来越加强领导，取得越来越多的成绩。但是领导一般化，不具体，因而不能解决实际问题和帮助工作，——各级党代表会议指出这是至今没有完全克服的较普遍的缺点。它表现在如下方面：
    （一）有些党的工作人员常常想以空泛的会议、决议、指令来领导突飞猛进的建设。高尔基州党委会和苏维埃执委会的某些工作人员，以党区委和区苏维埃执委的决议多寡来评断他们工作的好坏。这个州有一个区委会想消灭集体农庄的落后现象，在短短期间作出了约100个决议。这个区委常委会5次听取了集体农庄主席的报告，每次有39人报告，大部分农庄主席受到了处分。但是没有改进农庄的工作。
    （二）有些党的工作人员坐在办公室里的时间多，很少下到群众中去，就是下去也不喜欢和群众商量，不用心发现问题。沃洛高德州前州委书记谢明在任的3年中没有到过一半以上的区。克米罗夫市委第一书记格努什科夫到厂矿工地一蹓就走。他只限于同企业领导人员谈话，很少接触群众，所以市委会不容易发现企业工作中的缺点。
    （三）有些党的工作人员习惯于根据报告、表格、平均数字判断情况，不深入实际中去研究每个地方、每个工厂、每个农庄的具体情况和潜在力量，也不学习必要的工农业经济和技术知识，因而不能实现内行的有效的领导。卡拉干达州斯大林区在去年9个月中4次听取了一个矿井领导人员的报告。区委、市委、州委都讨论了克服这个矿井生产落后问题。但是因为只作了“改进工作”“加强政治工作”的一般指示，对事情没有什么帮助。斯塔甫罗波尔边疆斯巴科夫区驻在拖拉机站的区委书记什夫佐夫缺乏农业基本知识。人们问他农庄要播什么样种子，他答：“玉米——黄的，向日葵——黑的。”由于缺乏农业知识，他不能够保证集体农庄不发生选种不当之类影响生产的事情。
    苏共各级代表会议都拿起尖锐的批评和自我批评的武器克服这些缺点。因为这些工作人员的脱离实际的领导方法是和苏联共产党的传统的联系群众的领导作风毫无相同之处的。因为一般化的领导方法是违反苏共中央1955年1月和7月全会的精神的。1月全会要求地方党政工作人员深入到农业生产的一切方面，具体地、熟悉业务地领导集体农庄和国营农场。7月全会要求党政工作人员把主要努力集中在组织生产上面，认真地研究各个工业企业的工作，深入地了解生产技术和经济，支持新事物新技术，对工业进行具体的领导。
