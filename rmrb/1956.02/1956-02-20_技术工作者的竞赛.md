    Competition Among Technical Workers
    The Technology Section and the Metallurgy Section of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, along with all the process workers in 13 basic production workshops, issued a challenge on January 26th to "Launch a socialist competition with process workers in the industrial sector." They proposed that process workers in various plants within the First Ministry of Machine Building system jointly engage in socialist competition to strive for the rapid mastery of new technologies, the completion of technical transformations of existing enterprises, and the improvement of technical capabilities and enterprise management levels.
    This is a new initiative in intra-trade competition and represents a further surge in the enthusiasm of engineering and technical personnel for building socialism.
    The launch of intra-trade competition among technical personnel, enabling those lagging behind to quickly learn from the advanced, can greatly accelerate the pace of technological progress. Therefore, it is hoped that engineering and technical personnel in all positions will launch this socialist competition movement of mutual exchange of experiences.

    技术工作者的竞赛
    第一汽车制造厂工艺处、冶金处和13个基本生产车间的全体工艺工作者，1月26日提出“开展同产业工艺工作者社会主义竞赛”的挑战书，建议第一机械工业部系统各厂的工艺工作者共同开展社会主义竞赛，争取迅速掌握新技术和完成原有企业的技术改造，提高技术能力和企业管理水平。
    这是同工种竞赛中的一个新创举，是工程技术人员建设社会主义热情进一步高涨的表现。
    技术人员之间展开了同工种竞赛，使落后者迅速地向先进者看齐，就可以大大加快技术进步的速度。因此，希望一切岗位上的工程技术人员，都展开这种互相交流经验的社会主义竞赛运动。
