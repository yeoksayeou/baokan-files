Xinhua News Agency, London, 24th: Europe remains gripped by a cold wave. According to the Associated Press, 762 deaths have been confirmed as a result of the cold wave in the past 23 days. German climate experts say that this cold wave may be the most severe in Central Europe in the past 200 years.

Many rivers in Europe are frozen. The Baltic Sea has frozen, and some parts of the Atlantic coast have also frozen, with hundreds of ships trapped on their routes.

Crop losses in continental Europe have already reached hundreds of millions of dollars. Snow and ice have prevented normal market activity, with vegetable prices in France generally doubling and grain prices soaring in Italy. In towns in southern Italy, protesting crowds demanding relief clashed with police due to the difficult living conditions.

The cold has caused many construction workers in Italy to stop working, and 3,000 shipyard workers in Sunderland, England, have also been sent home. The Danish Parliament was forced to postpone its meeting because members had difficulty traveling, and there is a general shortage of coal in West German towns.

In Italy and some parts of Southern Europe, floods and landslides have caused new disasters due to the melting snow and ice.

    欧洲在寒潮侵袭中
    新华社24日讯　伦敦消息：欧洲仍然在寒潮侵袭中。据美联社报道，在寒潮袭击的23天里，已经查明有762人因此而死亡。德国的气候专家说，这次寒潮可能是中欧200年来最严重的一次。
    欧洲的许多河流都冰冻了。波罗的海结了冰，大西洋海岸也有一些地方结了冰，成百艘轮船被冻住在航线上。
    欧洲大陆上农作物的损失已经达到好几亿美元。冰雪阻止了正常的市场活动，法国的蔬菜价格普遍上涨了一倍，意大利粮食价格飞涨。在意大利南部的城镇里，因为生活困难而要求救济的示威群众同警察发生了冲突。
    寒冷使意大利许多建筑工人停止了工作，英国桑德兰的3，000名造船工人也被送回了家。丹麦的议会开会因为议员们行路不便而被迫改期，西德的城镇普遍缺煤。
    在意大利和南欧一些地方，由于冰雪消融，洪水和山崩已经造成了新的灾难。
