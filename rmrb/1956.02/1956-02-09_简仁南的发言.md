    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

    I am from Taiwan. I am a doctor, working at Dalian Medical College. After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's political report and Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of the socialist revolution, I am very excited, and I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support them.

    My hometown, Taiwan, has not yet been liberated. Taiwan has a large number of intellectuals and many doctors. Some are unemployed at home, some are wandering the streets, impoverished and frustrated, feeling that there is no way out. The Chiang Kai-shek group not only brought secret agents and terror to Taiwan, but also brought diseases that had already been eradicated in Taiwan.

    Originally, Taiwan had the conditions to improve its sanitation. However, this is not the case now. Taking lung disease as an example, there are hundreds of thousands of patients. According to statistics, one person dies from lung disease every 43 minutes. There are many doctors, but diseases are rampant. What is the reason for this? The reason is that people cannot afford medical treatment. In Yilan, there was a man named You who had 3 children, one 3 years old, one 11 years old, and one 13 years old. He sold all 3 children. This situation is very common. Imagine, even children are sold, how can they afford medical treatment?

    We should express our deep sympathy and condolences to the intellectuals and doctors in Taiwan. Of course, we hope that Taiwan can be liberated as soon as possible, so that parents in Taiwan will no longer sell their beloved children!

    I am a surgeon, an intellectual, and I want to talk about the learning of medical workers. The Party and Chairman Mao's decisions on eliminating the four pests and eradicating the nine major diseases that are most harmful to the people, as well as the instructions to bring our country's most urgently needed scientific departments close to the world's advanced level within 12 years, are very correct, necessary, and timely. Therefore, in order to complete this political task, in the medical field, in addition to studying Marxist-Leninist theory, I think we should also improve our professional level, carry out research work, and learn from the Soviet Union and from traditional Chinese medicine.

    I work in Dalian and have more opportunities to contact Soviet doctors. I recall that after our volunteer army went abroad to fight, Dalian became the front line of our rear. We are medical workers of the motherland, and we have the responsibility to cure our lovable people – the wounded and sick of the volunteer army. At that time, Dalian's medical teaching institutions and hospital departments successively established war injury hospitals, and medical workers rushed to participate in this work. From that day on, we often had the opportunity to be with Soviet experts, learning their war injury treatment experience and their medical style.

    Soviet experts gave us earnest instruction and helped us a lot not only in medical treatment but also in hospital management. For example, to prevent the invasion of wartime infectious diseases, an admission office was set up. Before entering the ward, clothes were deloused and disinfected, all hair was shaved off, and then a shower was taken and new clothes were changed before entering the ward. This prevents the invasion of infectious diseases and eliminates the spread of infectious diseases. We usually did not have war injury treatment experience, and they kindly taught us to use tissue therapy, physical therapy, and other comprehensive therapies, which brought great benefits to the wounded. Generally, for head and chest surgery, they guided us to use Vishnevsky's local anesthesia method, which is simple to operate, convenient for post-operative treatment, can be used in large quantities, and has no side effects. It created favorable conditions for us to develop chest surgery. In this way, the selfless assistance of Soviet experts is the main factor ensuring that our country improves its scientific and technological level in a short period of time.

    The medical style of Soviet doctors is even more worthy of our learning. They are always diligent and kind to the wounded, speak in low voices, and strictly implement the protective medical system to make the wounded feel at ease in recuperating. Sometimes they often bring toys for children at home to the wounded. For the seriously wounded, they always examine them several times a day, and often come at the first call in the dark nights of ice, snow, and cold wind, without complaint. Sometimes they couldn't wait to open the door and climbed over the wall. They even transfused their own blood to the wounded. This revolutionary humanitarian spirit of saving lives and helping the wounded moved the wounded to tears. We doctors were also educated.

    Learning from traditional Chinese medicine is also a major task for Western medicine. In the past, I had incorrect views on traditional Chinese medicine, thinking that traditional Chinese medicine had no theoretical basis, no physical and chemical examinations, and was unscientific. This view is wrong.

    Facts have proved that traditional Chinese medicine is the experience accumulated over thousands of years in our country, a valuable cultural heritage of our country, and it has rich scientific value. In terms of theoretical basis, such as anatomy and physiology, as early as the Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, there were detailed records of the measurement of the length of the digestive tract and the principle of blood circulation. These records were much earlier than the publications of Herophilos and William Harvey, which made me realize and correct my wrong views.

    In the clinical field, some diseases such as hypertension and epidemic encephalitis B, rely on traditional Chinese medicine to achieve obvious results.

    Even in surgery, China has a lot of experience. For example, the thread-hanging therapy for anal and rectal fistula and the dry hemorrhoid powder therapy for hemorrhoids have achieved remarkable results. As recorded in history, Hua Tuo was a famous surgeon, and he may have been the first person to use anesthesia.

    Secondly, in terms of the number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, there are more than 300,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, while there are only 70,000 Western medicine practitioners. Traditional Chinese medicine is widely and deeply rooted in every corner of the countryside and has close ties with the broad masses of farmers. Traditional Chinese medicine is a strong medical team and is still an indispensable part of the entire medical and health care cause. In today's development of agricultural cooperativization, the responsibility for health care, prevention, treatment, and elimination of diseases is significant. I think we should well follow Chairman Mao's instructions to promote the medicine of the motherland and for Western medicine to learn from traditional Chinese medicine. We Western medicine should learn from traditional Chinese medicine, explore the treasures of Chinese medicine, and exchange academic experiences between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Each should do his best, each should do what he knows, unite as one, integrate, and combine to make Chinese medicine flourish, serve the construction of the socialist motherland, and serve the health of the broad masses of farmers.

    Workers, peasants, and intellectuals unite, and the people of the whole country unite to struggle for the construction of socialism and the liberation of Taiwan, and to struggle to complete the sacred task of liberating all of China!

    简仁南的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我是台湾人。我是一个医生，在大连医学院服务。听到了周恩来主席的政治报告、郭沫若副主席的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告，我非常兴奋，同时，完全同意和衷心拥护。
    我的家乡台湾，还没有解放。台湾有大批知识分子，有很多医生。他们有的在家失业，有的在街头流浪，贫困潦倒，终日苦闷，觉得没有出路。蒋介石集团不但把特务和恐怖带进台湾，还把在台湾已经消灭的疾病带进台湾。
    本来，台湾是有条件把卫生搞得比较好的。可是，现在不然，仅就肺病一项而论，就有几十万患者。据统计，每43分钟便有一人死于肺病。医生很多，而疾病猖狂，这是什么原因呢？原因是，人民医不起病。宜兰有一个姓游的，有3个孩子，一个3岁，一个11岁，一个13岁，他把3个孩子都卖掉了。这种情况是很普遍的。你想，连孩子都卖掉了，怎么能够医病呢？
    我们在这里应该对台湾的知识分子、台湾的医生们，表示深切的同情与慰问。当然，我们更希望台湾能够早日得到解放，让台湾的父母不再出卖自己心爱的儿女！
    我是一个外科医生，是一个知识分子，我要谈一谈医务工作者的学习问题。党与毛主席关于除四害和消灭危害人民最严重的九大疾病的决定，以及要在12年内使我国最急需的科学部门能够接近世界先进水平的指示，是十分正确的、必要的、适时的。因此，要完成这项政治任务，在医学方面，除了应该学习马克思列宁主义理论而外，我觉得还要在业务上提高水平，开展研究工作，并且向苏联学习，向中医学习。
    我在大连工作，有更多的机会和苏联的医生接触。我回忆在我国志愿军出国作战以后，大连成了我们后方的前线。我们是祖国的医务工作者，对我们的可爱的人——志愿军的伤病员负有医好他们的责任。当时，大连各医疗教学机关、医院部门，先后设立战伤医院、医务工作者都争先恐后参加这项工作。从这天起，我们经常有机会和苏联专家在一起，学习他们的战伤治疗经验，学习他们的医疗作风。
    苏联专家们对我们谆谆善诱，不但在医疗方面上、在医院管理方面，都给我们很大的帮助。例如：防止战时传染病的侵入，设立入院处，在入病房前，进行衣服灭虱消毒，实行毛发全部剃光，然后进行淋浴，更换新衣，始进病房。这样就能防止传染病的侵入，杜绝了传染病的流行。我们平时没有战伤治疗经验，他亲切地教导我们，使用组织疗法、体育疗法、其他综合疗法等，给伤员带来了很大的好处。一般对头、胸部手术，指导我们使用维氏局部麻醉法，此法操作简单，后疗法方便，可大量使用，并且没有副作用。给我们开展胸部外科，创下了有利的条件。像这样，苏联专家对我们无私的援助，是保证我国在短短时期内提高科学技术水平的主要因素。
    苏联大夫们的医疗作风更值得我们学习。他们对伤员总是殷勤亲切，低声细语，厉行保护性医疗制度，使伤员安心休养。有时经常把家里小孩用的玩具带给伤员。对重伤的伤员，总是一日几次诊视，经常在冰雪寒风的黑夜，不辞劳苦，一请就到。有时等不得开门，越墙而入。甚至把自己的血输给伤员。这种救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神，使伤员感激到流泪。我们医生也受到了教育。
    对于向中医学习，也是西医的一项主要任务。我过去对中医抱着不正确的看法，认为中医没有理论基础，没有理化检查，不科学。这种看法是错误的。
    事实证明，中医药是我国几千年来积累的经验，我国宝贵的文化遗产，它有丰富的科学价值。在理论基础方面，如解剖、生理，早在黄帝内经里对于消化道长度的测量，血液循环的原理，已有详细的记载。这些记载远比斯巴托赫兹和威廉·哈维的发表更早的多，使我认识了，来纠正我的错误观点。
    在临床方面，有些疾病如高血压、流行性乙型脑炎等症，依靠中医药取得显然的成效。
    就是在外科方面，中国也有不少经验。例如：肛门直肠瘘的挂线疗法、痔的枯痔散疗法，已获得显著的成就。像历史记载着的华陀就是一个著名的外科医生，他可能是最早应用麻药的第一个人。
    其次，就中医人数来看，中医则有30多万人，西医不过7万人。中医普遍深入在每个乡村角落，和广大农民群众有密切结合。中医是一个雄厚的医学队伍，仍为整个医疗保健事业中不可缺少的部分。在农业合作化发展的今日，对于卫生保健事业，预防治疗，消灭疾病，所担起的责任是重大的。我认为，我们要很好地遵循着毛主席发扬祖国医学、西医学习中医的指示。我们西医应向中医学习，挖掘中国医学的宝藏，中西医互相交流学术经验，各尽所能，各尽所知，团结一致，汇通化合，使中国医学发扬光大，为建设祖国的社会主义服务，为保障广大农民的健康服务。
    工人、农民、知识分子团结起来，全国人民团结起来，为建设社会主义和解放台湾而奋斗，为完成解放全中国的神圣任务而奋斗！
