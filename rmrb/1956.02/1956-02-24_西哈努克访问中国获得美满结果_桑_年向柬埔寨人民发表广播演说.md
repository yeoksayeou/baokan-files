Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 23rd - Phnom Penh dispatch: Sang Nhean, Deputy Speaker of the Kingdom Assembly and member of the Cambodian Royal National Delegation, who recently returned from a visit to China, delivered a radio address on February 21st at Phnom Penh Radio, reporting to the Cambodian people on the visit of the Royal National Delegation to China. He said that Prince Sihanouk's visit to Beijing had achieved satisfactory results.

　　In his broadcast, Sang Nhean first praised the Chinese people's sincere and enthusiastic welcome to the Cambodian Royal National Delegation. He said that the Chinese people were truly enthusiastic, and they were welcoming sincerely, welcoming people and hearts. This proves the friendly relationship between the two countries. When he talked about Premier Zhou Enlai holding a reception to welcome Prince Sihanouk and the delegation, he said that their conversation was like brothers reunited after a long separation.

　　Next, Sang Nhean talked about the meeting between Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai. He said that the Prince introduced Cambodia's neutral policy to Mr. Zhou Enlai in detail, and said that he would defend this neutral policy. The Prince said that when he was in the Philippines, the Philippines intended to have Cambodia join the Southeast Asia Group, but Cambodia did not join this group. The Prince also said that Cambodia should act in accordance with the spirit of the Asian-African Conference, respect other countries, and not interfere in other countries. Mr. Zhou Enlai expressed his pleasure and praised the Prince's line. Mr. Zhou Enlai said that although China is still under construction, if Cambodia needs anything, China will provide assistance. The Prince was very happy about the above conversation. Sang Nhean said that the result of Prince Sihanouk's visit to China was very satisfactory. The Cambodian flag and the Chinese flag flying in parallel showed the feelings of friendship and the spirit of defending peace.

　　Sang Nhean had a good impression of Chairman Mao Zedong's reception. He said that Chairman Mao Zedong not only sincerely received the Prince, but also treated the entire delegation in the same way. Sang Nhean said, I feel that no matter how much any country respects us, there is always something in their attitude. The Chinese government and Chairman Mao Zedong's welcome to the Prince was not like that; they were very sincere and without any ulterior motives.

　　Sang Nhean finally said that his overall feeling is that the result of this visit of the Prince to China is very important, as if he brought back golden treasures, but it still needs to be protected by the people and various political figures.

    西哈努克访问中国获得美满结果
    桑·年向柬埔寨人民发表广播演说
    新华社河内23日电　金边消息：刚从中国访问回来的柬埔寨王国国家代表团团员、王国会议副议长桑·年2月21日在金边电台发表广播演说，向柬埔寨人民报告了王国国家代表团访问中国的情况。他说，西哈努克亲王到北京的访问已经获得美满的结果。
    桑·年在广播中首先盛赞中国人民对柬埔寨王国国家代表团真诚的、热情的欢迎。他说，中国人民真是热情，他们是诚心诚意的迎接，是在迎接人和心。这证明了两国之间的友谊关系。他在谈到周恩来总理举行酒会欢迎西哈努克亲王和代表团的时候说，他们的谈话像久别重逢的兄弟一样。
    接着，桑·年谈到了西哈努克亲王和周恩来总理会谈的情况。他说，亲王向周恩来先生详细地介绍了柬埔寨的中立政策，并且说要保卫这个中立政策。亲王说，他在菲律宾的时候，菲律宾有意要柬埔寨加入东南亚集团，但是柬埔寨不加入这个集团。亲王还说，柬埔寨要按亚非会议的精神来做，尊重其他国家，不干涉其他国家。周恩来先生表示愉快，并且赞扬了亲王的路线。周恩来先生说，尽管中国正在建设期间，但是，如果柬埔寨需要什么，中国将给以帮助。亲王对上面的谈话非常高兴。桑·年说，西哈努克亲王访问中国的结果是很美满的。柬埔寨的国旗和中国的国旗平行的飘扬，表示了友谊的情感和保卫和平的精神。
    桑·年对毛泽东主席的接见，留下了良好的印象。他说，毛泽东主席不仅是诚心诚意的接见亲王，对整个代表团也是这样。桑·年说，我觉得不论那一个国家怎样尊重我们，在态度上总还有一些什么东西。中国政府和毛泽东主席对亲王的迎接，却并不是那样，他们是非常诚恳的，没有任何手段。
    桑·年最后说，我总的感觉是，这次亲王到中国去的结果很重要，好像带了金玉宝贝回来一样，但是还要由人民和各个政治人物来保护它。
