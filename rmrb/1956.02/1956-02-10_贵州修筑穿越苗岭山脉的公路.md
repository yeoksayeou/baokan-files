Guizhou is building a highway through the Miaoling Mountains
    Construction of a highway in Guizhou Province from Leishan Miao Autonomous County to Taijiang Miao Autonomous County and Jianhe County officially began on February 1. This highway, which traverses the Miaoling Mountains, is 194 kilometers long and winds through towering mountains and steep ridges, making construction extremely difficult. More than 300 bridges and culverts need to be built along the entire route. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of June.

    贵州修筑穿越苗岭山脉的公路
    贵州省从雷山苗族自治县到台江苗族自治县和剑河县之间的公路，已经在2月1日正式开工修建。这条穿越苗岭山脉的公路共长194公里，它盘旋在崇山峻岭中，修建工程非常艰巨，全线需要修建的桥梁、涵洞就有300多处。这全部工程预计在6月底完成。
