Two different types of international economic relations exist in the world today.

One is international economic relations established under the policies of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs. Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, recently gave a brief explanation of this policy in his political report to the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. He said: "The policy pursued by socialist countries when they provide mutual assistance or conduct economic cooperation with other countries is, first of all, to exchange what one has for what one needs. We do not force other countries to accept goods that they do not need or that they have sufficient production of themselves. Another characteristic of our policy is to help economically underdeveloped countries develop their own industries and achieve economic independence. Furthermore, we do not demand any privileges from the countries receiving assistance. Whether we provide economic or technical assistance, the principle we adhere to is always equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs." These are not empty words, but policies that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries are already putting into practice. According to this policy, many trade agreements and various protocols for economic exchanges have been signed between socialist countries and between socialist countries and other countries willing to establish such equal and mutually beneficial relations, and equal and mutually beneficial economic exchanges with increasingly rich content have been carried out. Facts have proven that this kind of international economic relation has greatly increased the trade volume between the countries concerned, and the types of commodities entering international trade have also increased. Through low-interest loans and selfless assistance in materials and technology, the Soviet Union has not only played a significant role in the rapid recovery of the economies of the People's Republic of China and other brotherly countries, but has also helped these countries embark on the road to industrialization at an astonishing speed.

Therefore, this kind of equal and mutually beneficial international economic relation has already grown in practice, forming a new type of international economic relation unprecedented in history. This is a landmark development in international relations after World War II, and the impact of this new development extends far beyond socialist countries.

The economic relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as the brotherly countries, provide a new example, attracting the attention of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa who have long suffered from the pain of international aggression policies. The resolution unanimously adopted by the representatives of the 29 countries participating in the Economic Committee at the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955 affirmed that "there is a general desire among the participating countries to implement economic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty." Yes, mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty are the principles upon which we base ourselves in international economic relations, as Chairman Zhou Enlai said. The trade agreements signed between China and several Asian neighbors, the Soviet Union's assistance to India in building a factory with an annual output of 1 million tons of steel, the economic assistance announced by Bulganin and Khrushchev to India and Burma during their visit to these two countries last winter, and the complete sets of factory equipment supplied by Czechoslovakia and Hungary to India, Afghanistan, and other countries are all based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in the internal affairs of the recipient countries.

According to the aforementioned principles of Chairman Zhou Enlai, the content of this new international economic relation can be summarized into five points: (1) Respecting the other party's independent sovereignty, and not demanding any privileges from the other party as a condition of trade or assistance; (2) Exchanging what one has for what one needs without discrimination, regardless of the other country's socio-economic and political system; in other words, no trade discrimination or embargo measures against any country; (3) Conducting trade and technical exchanges on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, without forcing the other party to accept materials they do not need, nor demanding any exchange conditions that cater to one-sided interests; (4) Selflessly helping recipient countries develop their industries and achieve economic independence; (5) Fully considering the possibility of the other party making payments through exporting products in both trade and assistance, thereby avoiding the unfavorable situation of the other party being burdened with long-term debts due to payment difficulties.

Why can socialist countries do this? Mainly because the socialist political and economic system does not need to and does not intend to exploit or invade other countries. Comrade Khrushchev clearly stated: "We do not have surplus capital. We manage our economy according to plan. We are not concerned about the export of capital or the export of goods. The goods we produce are only for the needs of our country and our allies, and to ensure the needs of foreign trade. The output of some of our commodities is temporarily insufficient to meet the country's growing needs. Even so, we still believe that it is our duty to share weal and woe with our friends and help them in a brotherly manner. This kind of assistance on mutually beneficial terms is beneficial to each other. Our friends know that the selfless assistance they receive from us is drawn from our internal funds. Our friends will not fail to value this, because it demonstrates our sincere desire." (Speech at the Joint Session of the Two Chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union) This explains the essence of equal and mutually beneficial international economic relations, and also explains why this new type of international economic relation has become an undeniable force for peace.

There is also another type of international economic relation that is completely opposite in nature. This is the aggressive international economic relation that the American imperialist bloc imposes on many countries. As Chairman Zhou Enlai pointed out in his political report, the American imperialist bloc "dumps surplus materials in the name of 'aid,' thereby seizing the markets of other countries and undermining their economies. It keeps backward countries permanently in the position of suppliers of raw materials and sales markets for industrial products, in order to enslave and exploit them. Through so-called 'aid,' it demands that 'recipient' countries cede military bases, undertake obligations that are detrimental to them militarily, politically, and economically, and demand supervision of the use of 'aid' in order to control the 'recipient' countries."

The situation of this policy of the American imperialist bloc after World War II can be briefly described as follows: Initially, it was the "Marshall Plan," whose main attempt was to occupy international markets by exporting consumer goods that could not be sold in the American market, and to try to export the crisis that was increasingly threatening the American economy, while also using this to make the recipient countries dependent on the United States. The executing agency was called the "Economic Cooperation Administration." The result was the destruction of the economy of the "recipient" countries, but it did not find a way out for the American economic crisis. Thus, American monopoly capital became increasingly obsessed with military adventures, driving the United States and countries following the American policy onto the road of economic militarization in order to extract high profits. After the start of the war of aggression against Korea, the "Foreign Aid Appropriations Act" in 1951 clearly proposed a policy based on military "aid," while so-called economic "aid" was merely a bait for "recipient" countries to undertake military obligations. Later, the "Economic Cooperation Administration" was changed to the "Mutual Security Agency," and various American "aid" plans, such as military "aid," economic "aid," the "Point Four Program," and the "Economic Cooperation Administration's" "aid" work in Southeast Asia, were all coordinated and handled by the "Mutual Security Agency." Both in the announced methods and in the organizational structure, the aggressive and military purposes of this so-called "aid" were very clear.

This approach of the American imperialist bloc has aroused many concerns and dissatisfactions even in its so-called allies. After the forced end of the war of aggression against Korea, this very blatant practice of linking military and economic "aid" together became even more untenable, and thus encountered stronger resistance everywhere, so that even the budgeted money could not be spent. Therefore, on August 1, 1953, Washington reorganized the "Mutual Security Agency" into the "Foreign Operations Administration." But this was only a change in the name of the executing agency; the essence of the military and political content of the so-called "aid" did not change at all. Just take the "embargo" against socialist countries as an example. It was originally enforced by imposing it on "recipient" countries as a condition for accepting American "aid." The countries forced to implement it have suffered many losses as a result, and the voices of resistance from the people of various countries are growing louder. Lokanathan, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, recently told the Bangkok press that "as a result of the implementation of the 'embargo,' there has been no major impact on China, but the trade of those countries that have implemented the embargo has suffered greatly as a result... These countries that once advocated the embargo have unanimously requested the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East to lift the 'embargo' against China." However, the American imperialist bloc is still stubbornly adhering to this policy to this day.

The "embargo" is only one of the conditions for accepting American "aid." In addition, there are many other conditions, such as joining military aggression blocs controlled by the United States, ceding military bases, undertaking other obligations to expand armaments and prepare for war, accepting American surplus materials that the "recipient" countries do not need, guaranteeing the United States priority in obtaining strategic raw materials in the "recipient" countries, forcing the "recipient" countries to establish so-called "counterpart funds" and placing the use of these funds and the American "aid" dollars themselves entirely under the supervision and control of American officials stationed in the "recipient" countries. It can be said that this has formed an American "aid" system, an aggressive international economic relation system under the guise of "aid."

But any deceptive policy, as Lincoln said, can only deceive many people for a while or one person for a long time, but it cannot deceive many people forever. In the process of past implementation, the essence of this aggressive "aid" has become increasingly clearly exposed to the people of the world, including the people of the "recipient" countries, and even within the American ruling bloc, some people have long openly admitted this fact. As early as 1954, Senator Mansfield of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said during a discussion of the "Mutual Security Act" appropriations bill: "All the new signs we see indicate that our aid is causing more resentment than friendship." Since American "aid" is so unwelcome, why insist on it? Why did the act finally passed by the US Congress on July 7, 1955 stipulate that the United States would allocate more than $3,285 million in 1956 as a fund for "aid" to other countries? The obvious reason is that American monopoly capital has, through the guise of American "aid," established a whole set of international economic relations of exploitation and aggression and a set of methods for instigating the Cold War, thereby obtaining many orders, especially military orders, and earning huge excess profits. As Dulles said: "Every dollar of aid to foreign countries is spent directly or indirectly in the United States." Therefore, American monopoly capital certainly does not want to and cannot easily abandon the guise of American "aid"!

In today's world, encouraged by the Geneva spirit of peaceful coexistence and the Bandung spirit of anti-colonialism, and in today's world, when the socialist camp's peace policy occupies a great initiative in international diplomacy, the American approach is becoming increasingly unworkable. In the situation where the socialist countries' genuine assistance to other countries, especially Asian and African countries, under the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs has been warmly welcomed and supported by the people of these countries, the United States is trying to salvage its political and economic enslavement of backward countries by so-called "undertaking long-term obligations to provide assistance." They particularly emphasize that they will put the focus of "aid" on Asia and Africa. Many Western commentators believe that the purpose of strengthening "aid" is also to strengthen the United States' policy of strength.

Prime Minister Nehru has expressed his views on foreign aid with political conditions more than once. Recently (February 2), he also pointed out very clearly at the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East: "If financial or technical assistance to these backward countries is combined with certain political issues or political considerations, then this assistance loses its value and effect, and this assistance will also be fundamentally damaged by the motives hidden behind it." A Pan-Asia News Agency report from Tokyo on January 19 stated, "Informed sources say that Asian countries generally refuse American economic aid as long as such American aid is attached to any conditions." Recently, the Japanese Economic Planning Agency published a booklet that analyzes and compares the two types of assistance in detail, concluding that "the United States is fighting a losing battle in the competition to provide economic assistance to the world's backward countries with Russia." (Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, January 31)

Yes, this failure of the United States is inevitable. Because equal and mutually beneficial international economic relations are welcomed by all countries that demand independence and autonomy, while aggressive international economic relations are bound to be opposed by countries that demand independence and autonomy.

    两种国际经济关系
    冀朝鼎
    现在世界上同时存在着两种不同的国际经济关系。
    一种是平等互利和互不干涉内政政策之下所建立的国际经济关系。中国人民政治协商会议主席周恩来最近在政协第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议的政治报告里对这种政策曾简要地加以说明。他说：“社会主义国家在互相支援或者同其他国家进行经济合作的时候所执行的政策，首先是互通有无。我们不强迫别的国家接受它们所不需要的或者它们自己有足够生产的货品。我们的政策的另一个特点是帮助经济上不发达的国家发展本国的工业和取得经济上的独立。我们并且不向受援助的国家要求任何特权。不论我们所提供的是经济上的或者是技术上的帮助，我们所根据的原则始终是平等互利和互不干涉内政。”这不是空话，而是苏联、中华人民共和国及其他社会主义国家已经在实践中的政策。根据这个政策，社会主义国家间以及社会主义国家和愿意建立这种平等互利关系的其他国家间，已经签订了很多贸易协定及各种经济往还的议定书，并且已经进行了内容日益丰富的平等互利的经济交流。事实证明，这种国际经济关系，使各有关国家间的贸易额大大增加，进入国际贸易的商品种类也增多了。透过低利贷款，物资及技术上的无私援助，苏联不只对中华人民共和国及其他兄弟国家经济的迅速恢复起了很大的作用，而且帮助这些国家以惊人的速度走上工业化的道路。
    因此，这种平等互利的国际经济关系已经在实践中成长起来，形成了一种史无前例的新型的国际经济关系。这是第二次世界大战后，国际关系上的一个划时代的发展，这种新发展的影响远超出了社会主义国家之外。
    苏联与中华人民共和国以及各兄弟国家的经济关系提供了一个新榜样，引起了全世界的注意，特别是久受国际侵略政策痛苦的亚非国家人民的注意。在1955年4月在万隆召开的亚非会议里参加经济委员会的29个国家的代表一致通过的决议中肯定地指出“在与会国中存有在互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上实行经济合作的普遍愿望。”是的，互利和互相尊重国家的主权，这就是周恩来主席所说我们在国际经济关系中所根据的原则。中国和几个亚洲邻邦所签订的贸易协定，苏联对印度关于建设年产100万吨钢的工厂的援助，以及布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫去冬访问印度、缅甸期间所宣布的对该两国经济上的援助，捷克斯洛伐克及匈牙利对印度、阿富汗等国供给的全套工厂设备等等，都是以平等互利、不干涉受援国内政的原则为根据的。
    这种新的国际经济关系的内容，根据周恩来主席上述的原则，可以概括地分五点来加以说明：（一）尊重对方独立主权，不以贸易或援助为条件向对方要求任何特权；（二）不论对方国家的社会经济政治制度，无歧视地互通有无；换句话说，就是没有对任何国家的贸易歧视及禁运措施；（三）以平等互利的原则进行贸易及技术交流，不强迫对方接受他们所不需要的物资，也不要求任何照顾单方利益的交换条件；（四）无私地帮助受援国家发展工业并取得经济上的独立；（五）在贸易及援助方面都充分地考虑到对方以出口产品进行支付的可能，由此避免因支付困难造成长期负债的对方的不利情况。
    为什么社会主义国家能这样做呢？主要的是因为社会主义的政治经济制度不需要也不打算剥削及侵略其他国家。赫鲁晓夫同志很明确地说过：“我们没有多余的资本。我们按照计划来管理我们的经济。我们并不关心资本的输出，不关心商品的输出，我们所生产的商品只供我们的国家和我们的同盟者的需要，以及保证对外贸易的需要。我们有一些商品的产量暂时不够满足国家的日益增长的需要。虽然这样，我们还是认为有责任同我们的朋友共甘苦，兄弟般地帮助他们。这种在互利条件下的帮助是彼此都有利益的。我们的朋友知道，他们从我们这里得到的无私的帮助是从我们的内部资金中抽出来的。而这点朋友们是不会不重视的，因为这说明了我们的正直的愿望。”（在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上的讲话）这说明了平等互利的国际经济关系的本质，也说明了为什么这种新型的国际经济关系已经成为一种不可忽视的和平力量。
    另外还有一种国际经济关系是本质上与此完全相反的。这就是美国侵略集团强加于很多国家的侵略性的国际经济关系。正如周恩来主席在他的政治报告中所指出的，美国侵略集团“借‘援助’之名倾销剩余物资，从而夺取其他国家的市场，破坏其他国家的经济。它使落后国家永远处于原料供应地和工业品销售市场的地位，以便对他们进行奴役和剥削。它通过所谓‘援助’，要求‘受援’国家割让军事基地，在军事上、政治上和经济上承担对他们不利的义务，要求对‘援助’的使用进行监督以便控制受‘援’国家。”
    美国侵略集团在第二次大战后这种政策的情况可以简略地分述如下：起初是“马歇尔计划”，其主要的企图是通过输出在美国市场无销路的消费品的方法占领国际市场，并企图将日益威胁着美国经济的危机输出，同时也借此使受援国家依赖美国。其执行的机构名为“经济合作署”。其结果是破坏了受“援”国的经济，但并没有为美国的经济危机找到出路。于是美国独占资本便愈益醉心于军事冒险，把美国及追随美国政策的国家赶上经济军事化的道路，以榨取高额利润。侵朝战争开始后，在1951年的“对外援助拨款法”便明显地提出以军事“援助”为主的政策，而所谓经济“援助”不过是为了受“援”国承担军事义务的一种诱饵而已。后来“经济合作署”改为“共同安全署”，并将美国各种“援助”计划，如军事“援助”，经济“援助”，“第四点计划”，及“经济合作署”在东南亚的“援助”工作，都交由“共同安全署”统筹办理。不论在公布的办法上及组织机构上，这种所谓“援助”的侵略性及军事目的都是很明确的。
    美国侵略集团的这种作法，即在它所谓同盟国里也引起了很多顾虑和不满。侵朝战争被迫结束后，这种十分露骨地把军事和经济“援助”联系起来的作法更站不住了，因此到处遭到更强烈的反抗，甚至连预定的钱都花不了，于是在1953年8月1日华盛顿便把“共同安全署”改组为“援外事务管理署”。但这只是个执行机构名称上的改变，所谓“援助”的军事政治内容的实质，并未丝毫改变。仅就对社会主义国家的“禁运”而论，本来是拿强加于受“援”国家作为接受美“援”的一个条件的方法来执行的。被迫执行的各国，因此蒙受很多损失，各国人民反抗的呼声亦日益高涨。联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会执行秘书洛卡纳坦最近向曼谷报界说“因为实行‘禁运’的结果，对中国并没有发生什么重大影响，但那些实行禁运的国家的贸易却因此而深受其害，……这些曾主张禁运的国家已一致向亚洲及远东经济委员会提出解除对中国‘禁运’的要求。”但是美国侵略集团一直到现在还是一意孤行的坚持这种政策。
    “禁运”不过是接受美“援”条件之一。此外还有其他很多条件，如加入美国所控制的军事侵略集团，割让军事基地，承担其他扩军备战的义务，接受受“援”国所不需要的美国剩余物资，保证美国在受“援”国获取战略原料的优先权，迫使受“援”国建立所谓“对等基金”并将此基金及美“援”金元本身的使用，全部放在美国驻在受“援”国官员的监督控制之下。可以说这已经形成了一种美“援”制度，一种以“援助”为幌子的侵略性的国际经济关系体系。
    但是凡是带有欺骗性的政策，就如林肯所说的，只能欺多人于一时或一人于多时，但不能欺多人于永久。在过去执行的过程中，这种侵略“援助”的实质已经在世界人民，包括受“援”国的人民面前日益明显地暴露出来，甚至在美国统治集团内部，也早已有人公开承认这种事实了。远在1954年，美国参议院外交委员会委员曼斯菲尔在讨论“共同安全法”拨款法案发言时就说：“我们看到的一切新的征象，说明我们的援助所引起的，与其说是友好，毋宁说是愤怒。”美“援”既是如此不受欢迎，为什么还要坚持下去呢？为什么在1955年7月7日美国国会最后通过的法案中规定美国在1956年度还要拨出328，500多万美元作为对其他国家进行“援助”的基金呢？很明显的理由是美国独占资本透过美“援”的幌子，已经建立起整套国际剥削侵略的经济关系以及策动冷战的一套手法，由此得到很多的定货，特别是军事定货赚了很大的超额利润。正如杜勒斯所说的：“援助外国的每一块美元，都是直接或间接地花在美国的”。因此美国独占资本当然不肯也不能轻易放弃美“援”这个幌子！
    在和平共处的日内瓦精神及反殖民主义的万隆精神鼓舞下的今天，在社会主义阵营的和平政策在国际外交上占有伟大的主动性的今天，美国的这种做法越来越行不通了。在社会主义国家对其他国家，特别是亚非国家，在平等互利，不干涉内政原则下的真正援助已经得到这些国家人民热烈的欢迎及支持的情况下，美国正在想用所谓“承担进行援助的长期义务”的办法来挽救它对落后国家的政治和经济奴役。他们特别强调将要把“援助”的重点放在亚洲和非洲。很多西方国家的评论家认为所谓加强“援助”，其目的也是为加强美国的实力政策。
    尼赫鲁总理不只一次地表示过他对带有政治条件的外援的意见。最近（2月2日）他在联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会上又很明确地指出：“假如把对于这些落后国家的财政或技术援助同某些政治问题或政治考虑结合起来，那末这种援助就丧失了它的价值和作用，而且，这种援助也就要在基本上被它后面所隐藏的动机所损害了”。泛亚社东京1月19日报道“消息灵通人士说，亚洲国家普遍拒绝美国的经济援助，只要这种美国援助附有任何条件。”最近日本经济企划厅出了一本小册子，详细分析比较两种援助后，作出结论说：“美国在向世界上的落后国家提供经济援助的竞争方面，正在同俄国进行一场节节失败的战争。”（共同社东京1月31日报道）
    是的，美国的这种失败是不可避免的。因为平等互利的国际经济关系为一切要求独立自主的国家所欢迎，而侵略性的国际经济关系则必然要受到要求独立自主的国家的反对。
