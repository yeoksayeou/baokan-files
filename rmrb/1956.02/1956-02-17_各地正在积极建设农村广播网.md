    Rural Broadcasting Networks Are Being Actively Constructed in Various Locations
    Around the Spring Festival, the radio stations in 48 counties in Fujian Province can be expanded or completed, and the radio stations in more than 20 counties in Zhejiang Province and some counties in Liaoning, Gansu, Henan and other provinces will also start broadcasting.
    24 provinces and cities across the country, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, have formulated plans for the development of rural broadcasting networks. By the end of 1956, there may be 1,703 rural wired broadcasting stations nationwide; a total of 1,101,621 loudspeakers are distributed in rural areas across the country.
    Various localities are actively carrying out the construction and expansion of broadcasting stations. From November last year to recently, Anhui Province has built 8 rural wired broadcasting stations in 8 counties and cities, and installed more than 1,000 loudspeakers. Binyang County in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province has also established the first broadcasting station in the region, and will install 607 loudspeakers this year, so that every agricultural production cooperative will have loudspeakers. Jiangsu People's Broadcasting Station has installed 175 loudspeakers in 144 agricultural production cooperatives and farms in Yixing County.

    各地正在积极建设农村广播网
    春节前后，福建省有48个县的广播站可以扩建或建设完成，浙江省的20多个县和辽宁、甘肃、河南等省的部分县的广播站也都要开始播音。
    全国已经有24个省、市以及内蒙古自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区订出了发展农村广播网的规划。到1956年年底，全国可以有1，703个农村有线广播站；共有1，101，621个喇叭分布在各地农村里。
    各地正在积极进行广播站的建设和扩建工作。安徽省从去年11月到最近已经在8个县、市建成了8个农村有线广播站，安装了1，000多个喇叭。广西省桂西僮族自治区的宾阳县也建立了全区第一个广播站，要在今年内装置607个喇叭，作到每个农业生产合作社都有喇叭。江苏人民广播电台已经在宜兴县的144个农业生产合作社和农场里，安装了175个喇叭。
