Learning from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in the one-shift coal mining system has become a widespread trend in coal mines across the country. According to statistics from 21 coal mines, in the 50 or so days of this year alone, more than 160 coal mining faces in various mines have implemented the one-shift coal mining system. Adding the more than 20 faces that were already piloted last year, there are now nearly 200 faces nationwide formally adopting one-shift coal mining.

After implementing the one-shift coal mining system, the average efficiency of these coal mining faces has increased by 20% to 50% compared to the past. As of now, Kailuan Coal Mine has adopted one-shift coal mining on 26 faces, with the average efficiency per worker increasing by 28% compared to the past; the highest has increased from an average of 6.8 tons of coal mined per worker to 12.89 tons. The 11th Coal Mining Section of Fuxin Ping'an Mine was originally the most backward section in the entire mine, failing to complete its plan in January; after starting to implement the one-shift coal mining system on February 5th, the efficiency per worker increased by one and a half times, and they have already caught up to the advanced level. Due to the increased work efficiency, the labor force required for each working face has also been greatly reduced. Twelve coal mines, including Jiaozuo and Pingxiang, have saved more than 1,600 workers by promoting the one-shift coal mining system, supporting the originally weak tunneling departments and newly built mines.

The one-shift coal mining system is one of the main advanced experiences that the Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to promote in coal mines across the country. Its advantages are the rational arrangement of labor organization, which improves the work efficiency of coal miners, reduces personnel at the working face, and also ensures safe production. Therefore, it is deeply welcomed by leaders, cadres, and workers in various mines. Many coal mines have proactively formulated specific measures to promote this advanced experience, and workers have also actively learned, shortening the preparation time for various tasks.

    全国煤矿普遍推行一班采煤制
    近200个采煤工作面平均效率提高20％到50％
    学习苏联一班采煤制的先进经验，已经在全国煤矿中形成热潮。据21个煤矿统计，只在今年以来50多天中，各矿就有160多个采煤工作面推行了一班采煤制，加上去年已经试行的20多个工作面，现在全国有将近200个工作面正式采用了一班采煤。
    这些采煤工作面在实行一班采煤后，平均效率都比过去提高了20％到50％。开滦煤矿到目前为止，已经有26个工作面采用一班采煤，平均每工效率比过去提高了28％；最高的已经从平均每工采煤6.8吨增加到12.89吨。阜新平安矿第11采煤段原来是全矿最落后的一个段，1月份没有完成计划；2月5日开始实行一班采煤制以后，每工效率提高了一倍半，他们已经赶上了先进水平。由于工作效率提高，各个工作面需要的劳动力也已经大大减少。焦作、萍乡等12个煤矿，由于推广了一班采煤制，节省出了1，600多个工人，支援了原来薄弱的掘进部门和新建矿井。
    一班采煤制是煤炭工业部决定在全国煤矿中推广的主要先进经验之一。它的优点是合理安排劳动组织，使采煤工人的工作效率提高，工作面人员减少，并且还能保证安全生产。因此，深受各矿领导干部和工人群众欢迎。许多煤矿都主动订出了推广这一先进经验的具体措施，工人们也都积极学习，缩短了各项准备工作时间。
