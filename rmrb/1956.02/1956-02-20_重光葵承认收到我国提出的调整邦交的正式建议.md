Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th -- Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu葵 acknowledged during a reply to an interpellation in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on the 16th that Japan had received a proposal through formal channels from China regarding the adjustment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Prior to this, Shigemitsu had denied that Japan had received any such proposal from the Chinese government. Shigemitsu explained on the 16th that this was because he had "forgotten" about receiving the Chinese proposal. He said that "after investigation, the result proved" that Japan had indeed received a proposal from China through formal channels.

Shigemitsu stated that the Japanese government intends to submit a reply to China through formal channels in Geneva in the near future. However, the content of the reply will be that the "time is not yet ripe" for adjusting Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

The interpellation by Labor-Farmer Party member Haruo Okada reflected the desire of the Japanese public for the government to hold negotiations with the Chinese government on the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. He said that since China had made a proposal through formal channels, Japan should also decide to embark on the path of negotiation.

    重光葵承认收到我国提出的调整邦交的正式建议
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本外务相重光葵16日在众议院外务委员会答复质询时承认，日本曾经收到中国通过正规途径提出的关于调整中日两国邦交的建议。
    在这以前，重光曾经否认日本收到过中国政府的任何这样建议。重光16日解释说，这是因为他把收到中国的建议这件事“忘记了”。他说，“后来经过调查结果判明”日本曾经收到中国通过正规途径提出的建议。
    重光表示，日本政府打算在最近通过日内瓦的正规途径对中国提出答复。但是，答复的内容将是：调整中日邦交“时机还不成熟”。
    劳农党议员冈田春夫的质询，反映出日本公众要求政府就中日关系正常化问题同中国政府举行谈判的愿望。他说，既然中国曾经通过正规途径提出建议，日本方面也应该决定走上谈判的途径。
