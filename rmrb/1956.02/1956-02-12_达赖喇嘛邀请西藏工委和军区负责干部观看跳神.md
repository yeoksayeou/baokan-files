On February 10th, a grand God Dance (called "Gu Duo" in Tibetan) was held on the roof square of the Potala Palace in Lhasa. This was held according to traditional customs to welcome the Tibetan New Year. Early in the morning, Tibetan local government officials, both monks and laymen, and the people of Lhasa went to the Potala Palace in droves to watch the God Dance.

The Dalai Lama specially invited responsible cadres of the Chinese Communist Party Tibet Work Committee and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region to watch the God Dance. Zhang Guohua, Acting Secretary of the CCP Tibet Work Committee, and Lieutenant General Tan Guansan and Major General Jin Shaoshan of the Tibet Military Region watched the God Dance with the Dalai Lama.

Before the God Dance, they presented Hada scarves to the Dalai Lama to congratulate him on the Tibetan New Year. On the afternoon of the 9th, the Dalai Lama also sent his representative, Zhongni Qingbo Pala Tudeng Wudeng, to present Hada scarves and gifts to the responsible cadres of the CCP Tibet Work Committee and the Tibet Military Region to congratulate them on the New Year.
