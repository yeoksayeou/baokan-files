In the past few days, I have listened to the reports from the responsible leaders of various departments at the conference, and I have learned many things that I have not learned in my entire life. Among them, Premier Zhou Enlai's political report and President Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of the socialist revolution both specifically mentioned the glorious responsibility of intellectuals and workers and peasants forming an integrated whole in the socialist construction of the motherland, and the urgent issue of the self-remolding of intellectuals. I understand the glory of this responsibility, and at the same time, I understand the importance of the responsibility. Speaking from my own perspective, I must better remold myself in order to be worthy of being an intellectual of the people's era. According to my understanding, since the founding of New China six years ago, its international status has been rising day by day, its social appearance has been changing with each passing day, and all undertakings have been leaping forward towards socialism. This is entirely due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. It is due to the education and encouragement of the Party and Chairman Mao that mobilized 600 million pairs of diligent hands and all the thoughtful and studious minds in the country to embrace a brand-new attitude in various work positions, aiming at a common and far-reaching goal, and working day and night with enthusiasm and selflessness. The workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as the organizational leaders and workers on various production and construction fronts, have made particularly great contributions. Although intellectuals have also done their part, for various reasons, they have not fully exerted their strengths, and at the same time, it is still not easy to completely remove their original weaknesses, as analyzed in Premier Zhou's report. The new social situation requires intellectuals to better cooperate with the needs of national construction tomorrow, integrate their personal work into the national overall plan, form a solid alliance with workers and peasants, and push the history of the motherland forward. Under this new and solemn topic, how old intellectuals can further remold themselves and become new intellectuals is indeed an urgent issue.

I am an old intellectual who has engaged in novel writing for many years. Originally, I came from the people's ranks, but because my work had yielded some small gains, I became arrogant and self-important, just like a self-employed farmer who does not join anything. I stayed away from the struggle of the people, and my ideology was gradually corroded and captured by semi-colonial bourgeois viewpoints. My writing attitude and tendencies became increasingly unacceptable, causing many young readers to develop bad influences of escaping reality and being content with the status quo. However, I clung to a hypocritical liberalism, thinking that I would never be used by Chiang Kai-shek. In fact, the lack of a class stand and the inability to distinguish between the enemy and us in my writing attitude and work tendencies were most suitable for embellishing Chiang Kai-shek's dying regime, and did not benefit the people's cause in the slightest. The liberation of Beijing saved me from the erroneous development of being an empty writer.

After liberation, my work shifted to the field of cultural relics research. Although I have been learning to serve the people with new work under the long-term education, help, and encouragement of the Party, because I am engaged in the crafts department in the history of material culture development, which involves particularly many issues, my political and ideological level is low, my historical knowledge is shallow, and the old problem of being a self-employed farmer has not been completely eliminated. Therefore, my work is always full of twists and turns and problems, and it cannot withstand scrutiny. The work I can complete lags far behind the needs of society. After listening to Premier Zhou's numerical analysis of the situation of intellectuals, although my subjective wish is to be in the front, the objective facts may still fall within the 10% to 20% range. This aroused my vigilance and shame.

In the past 30 years, I did not believe that any political party could improve China all at once. Like many people, I naively and confusedly believed that if China had an Anglo-American-style parliamentary democratic system, with a large group of scientists and experts distributed in various jobs, it could be hoped that China would gradually be put on the right track. Although I expected Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and thoroughly corrupt regime to collapse, I never seriously analyzed or considered what regime would replace it. When it came to "people's liberation" and "personal ideological remolding," I found it difficult to understand. It was not until the country was truly liberated that, over the past six years, I gradually understood the errors in my past understanding through seeing things one by one and participating in a series of social reform movements. It was precisely because of liberation that the evil forces of imperialism in China for more than a hundred years were eradicated, that the end of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial regime was accelerated, that all peasants were able to turn over from the oppression of feudal landlords, and that the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises across the country came about today. From then on, all talents useful for national construction have had the opportunity to closely combine with the people's labor and give full play to their greatest efficiency for the long-term interests of the entire people. This proves that only the people's regime under the leadership of the Communist Party of China is a truly democratic regime that can liberate the infinitely rich wisdom and creative enthusiasm hidden within the Chinese people, incorporate it into the national plan, apply it to scientific research and industrial construction, realize the vision of national development, and make greater contributions to world peace and human progress.

In today's society, every job is closely related to the efforts of the entire people, and every new achievement encourages and helps promote the advancement of other work. The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao have led the Chinese people to bring Chinese history into a glorious path. I believe in the Communist Party. I must learn from outstanding Party members, strengthen my study of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, connect with business practice, and use the method of "three times a day I examine myself," mentioned in President Guo Moruo's report, to regularly check myself, strive to be a new intellectual of the Mao Zedong era, and contribute all the useful knowledge I have learned to the country. If my physical strength allows, I will also strive to restore my long-abandoned pen to eulogize and praise the new era, the new country, and the new people.

    沈从文的发言
    这几天，在大会中我听过了各部门负责首长的报告，我学习了一生没有学习到的许多事情。内中周恩来总理的政治报告，和郭沫若院长关于在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告，都特别提到祖国在社会主义建设中，知识分子和工人农民结成一体的光荣责任，和知识分子自我改造的迫切问题。我理会到这个责任的光荣，同时也明白责任的重大。从我自己说起，就是必需更好的自我改造，才够得上做个人民时代的知识分子。照我的认识，新中国成立6年以来，国际地位日益提高，社会面貌日新月异，一切事业能够飞跃的向社会主义迈进，完全是由于有中国共产党和毛主席正确的领导得到的。是由于党和毛主席的教育、鼓舞，动员了全国6亿双勤劳的手，和一切能够深思力学的头脑，在各种不同工作岗位上，抱着一种崭新的态度，指向一个共同远大的目标，日以继夜热情忘我劳动的结果。贡献特别大的，应当数工人、农民和战士，以及各个生产建设战线上的组织领导者和工作者。知识分子，虽然也尽了一分力量，由于种种原因，还没有完全发挥出他们的长处，同时也还不容易完全去掉本来的弱点，正如周总理报告中所分析的情形。社会新形势要求知识分子明天能够更好的配合国家建设需要，把个人工作纳入国家总计划中，和工人农民结成坚固的联盟，把祖国历史推向前进。在这个新的庄严课题下，旧知识分子如何进一步改造，变成一个新知识分子，实在是一个迫切问题。
    我是个旧知识分子，过去许多年来曾经从事小说写作，本来来自人民队伍中，由于工作小有收获，就自高自大，正和农民中的单干户一样，什么都不加入，远离人民群众的斗争，思想意识因此逐渐被半殖民地化的资产阶级观点腐蚀俘掳，写作态度和倾向，越来越要不得，使得许多年青读者，发生逃避现实安于现状的坏影响。我却空守着一种虚伪的自由主义，以为绝不受蒋介石利用。事实上缺少阶级立场，不能分清敌我的写作态度和作品倾向，就最适宜于点缀蒋介石回光返照的政权，对人民事业没有丝毫好处。北京解放，才把我从空头作家的错误发展中挽救过来。
    解放后，我的工作转到文物研究方面。虽然在党的长期教育帮助和鼓励下，学习用新的工作来为人民服务，但是由于搞的是物质文化发展史中的工艺部门，牵涉问题格外多，我的政治思想水平既低，史部学根柢又浅，单干户的老毛病也还未去尽，因此工作总是周折多，问题多，经不住检验。能完成的工作远远落后于社会要求。听过周总理对于知识分子情况数字分析后，我虽然主观愿望要在前边一点，客观事实可能还会落在百分之十几那个数字内。引起我警惕和惭愧。
    过去30年来，我是不相信有个什么政党能够把中国一下搞好的。我和许多人一样，又极其幼稚胡涂的认为中国如有个英美式的议会民主制度，一大群科学家专家分布在各项工作中，就可望慢慢的把中国纳入正轨。对于蒋介石独裁腐败透顶的政权，虽预料它必然要倒坍，但是用什么政权来代替，从没认真分析考虑过。提到“人民解放”和“个人思想改造”，我都难于理解。直到全国真的解放，6年以来，从一件一件事情看去，并参加了一系列的社会改革运动，我才日益明白过去认识上的错误。正因为解放，才把帝国主义在中国百余年的恶势力连根拔去，才加快结束了蒋介石的独裁政权，全体农民才从封建地主压迫下翻过身来，才有今天全国农业合作化高潮、和全国私营工商业的社会主义改造高潮的来临。从此以后，一切对国家建设有用的聪明才智，才有机会和人民劳动紧密结合起来，为全体人民长远利益发挥出最大的效率。这就证明只有在中国共产党领导下的人民政权，才是真正的民主政权，才能够把蕴藏在中国人民内部无限丰富的智慧和创造热情，全部解放出来，纳入国家计划中，运用到科学研究和工业建设上去，实现国家发展的远景，对世界和平、人类进步，作出更大的贡献。
    今天的社会，每一种工作都和人民全体的努力发生密切联系，每一方面的新成就都鼓励并帮助推动其他工作的前进，中国共产党和毛主席就这样领导中国人民把中国历史带入到一个光耀辉煌的道路上去。我相信了共产党。我一定要好好的向优秀党员看齐，加强学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，联系业务实践，并且用郭沫若院长报告中提起的三省吾身的方法，经常检查自己，努力作一个毛泽东时代的新知识分子，把学到的一切有用知识，全部贡献给国家。如果体力许可，还要努力恢复我荒废已久的笔，来讴歌赞美新的时代、新的国家和新的人民。
