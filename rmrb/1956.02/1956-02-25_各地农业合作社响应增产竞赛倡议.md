Following the joint initiative by national model agricultural laborers such as Li Shunda to launch an agricultural production increase emulation campaign to agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers across the country, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have responded enthusiastically. They have also turned to local farmers to propose initiatives and carry out production increase emulation campaigns within the scope of a province or county. According to statistics from Shandong Province at the end of January, more than 44,300 agricultural production cooperatives participated in the production increase emulation campaign. Intra-cooperative team-to-team, group-to-group, and member-to-member emulation are even more common. According to statistics from Hebei Province in early February, more than 70% of the cooperatives in the province carried out internal emulation, with 80-90% of the full and semi-labor force participating. In addition, many regions have also launched "Thousand-Jin Cooperative," "Thousand-Jin Township," and "Thousand-Jin Rice, Hundred-Jin Cotton, Ten-Thousand-Jin Sweet Potato" bumper harvest emulation campaigns.

Agricultural production cooperatives responding to the initiative have formulated emulation conditions based on local specific conditions, fully mobilizing cooperative members to tap production potential and break conservative thinking. The 11 agricultural production cooperatives led by Han En, Jin Shilong, Wu Fengqi, and others in Jilin Province, after studying the Draft National Agricultural Development Program Outline for 1956 to 1967, proposed that this year's grain output should increase by 50% to 70% compared to last year, exceeding the 1957 targets by 40% to 70%. The production increase targets of these 11 cooperatives are close to the 1967 targets in the Draft National Agricultural Development Program Outline. Among them, the production of the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hailong County this year will exceed the 1967 target in this program outline by 25%. Many agricultural production cooperatives have also put forward specific measures to ensure the completion of the production increase targets. For example, the Huayan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anshun County, Guizhou Province, decided to plant two crops a year on 85% of the land and three crops a year on 15% of the land this year. The Gaochao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guizhu County decided to build 33 large and small water conservancy projects this year to ensure that 70% of the fields are irrigated, and the amount of fertilizer will be 66% more than last year. The 50 agricultural production cooperatives in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, proposed that before the spring plowing, they would guarantee the completion of the county's 200,000 mu irrigation water conservancy plan, complete all stove renovations and other work, fundamentally solve the fertilizer problem, and carry out a technology popularization movement.

    各地农业合作社响应增产竞赛倡议
    全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达等人联名向全国的农业生产合作社、互助组和农民提出开展农业增产竞赛的倡议以后，各地农业生产合作社纷纷响应，并且转向当地农民提出倡议，开展一省、一县范围内的增产竞赛。山东省在1月底的统计，参加增产竞赛的农业生产合作社就有44，300多个。至于社内队和队、组和组、社员和社员之间的竞赛，就更为普遍。据河北省2月初的统计，全省有70％以上的社开展了社内竞赛，参加竞赛的全劳动力和半劳动力达到总数的百分之八、九十。此外，不少地区还开展了“千斤社”“千斤乡”“千斤稻、百斤棉、万斤薯”的丰产竞赛运动。
    响应倡议的农业生产合作社，都分别根据当地的具体条件，在充分发动社员挖掘生产潜力，打破保守思想的基础上，订出了竞赛条件。吉林省韩恩、金时龙、吴凤岐等人领导的11个农业生产合作社，在学习了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案以后，提出今年粮食产量要比去年增加50％到70％，超过1957年指标40％到70％。这11个社的增产指标，都接近了全国农业发展纲要草案中1967年的指标。其中，海龙县曙光农业生产合作社今年的生产，要超过这个纲要草案中1967年指标的25％。许多农业生产合作社还提出了保证完成增产指标的具体措施。如贵州省安顺县华严农业生产合作社决定今年以85％的田地种二季，15％的田地种三季；贵筑县高潮农业生产合作社决定今年要兴修大小水利33处，保证70％的田有水灌溉，肥料要比去年增加66％强。山西省解虞县50个农业生产合作社提出在春耕以前要保证完成全县灌溉20万亩的水利计划，全部完成改炉灶等工作，从根本上解决肥料问题，并且要开展技术普及运动。
