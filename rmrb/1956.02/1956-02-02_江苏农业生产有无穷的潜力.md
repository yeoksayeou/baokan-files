Jiangsu's Agricultural Production Has Infinite Potential
By Our Reporter Zhen Weimin

In 1955, the total output of grain and cotton in Jiangsu Province had already greatly exceeded the state targets for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan, 1957. Grain exceeded the target by 220 million jin; cotton exceeded the target by 1.28 million dan.

The fact that Jiangsu Province's grain and cotton production exceeded the First Five-Year Plan targets ahead of schedule fully demonstrates that there is infinite potential in agricultural production.

Jiangsu Province can be roughly divided into three types of areas.

The Taihu region in the Yangtze River Delta is a high-yield rice area with excellent natural conditions and great potential for increased production. When formulating the 1955 production increase plan, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, Songjiang Prefectural Party Committee, and Suzhou Prefectural Party Committee conducted a comprehensive survey of the area's potential for increased production. The survey results showed that 25% of the land in this area only grows one crop of rice, not wheat. If wheat is planted after the rice harvest, a significant increase in grain production can be achieved. More than half of the rice varieties in this area are low-yielding early and mid-season indica rice. If they are replaced with high-yielding and stable late-season japonica rice, the harm caused by rice stem borers can be fundamentally avoided, and the yield can be increased by more than 100 jin per mu. In the autumn of 1954, after criticizing conservative thinking, the Kunshan County Party Committee boldly mobilized the masses to completely replace 150,000 mu of land in 16 townships in southern Kunshan, where stem borer damage was severe, with late-season japonica rice, and ensured that "wherever insect pests occurred, they were eliminated." As a result, a comprehensive bumper harvest was achieved, with rice yields increasing by more than 100 jin per mu. In 1955 alone, the Taihu region increased grain production by 120 million jin by promoting the replacement of rice varieties with late-season japonica rice. Fengxian County improved the rotation system of grain, cotton, and green manure crops, advocating two crops per year and five crops in two years. In 1955, winter fallow land was basically eliminated, and the multiple cropping index increased from 137% to 191%. The experience of trial planting double-cropping rice in several places has proven that promoting double-cropping rice can take rice production a step further. The 1.9 mu of double-cropping rice trial-planted by the Haoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mishixiang, Jinshan County, yielded as much as 1,060 jin per mu. These agricultural production reforms have led to the emergence of many large-scale high-yield models in the Taihu region. There are two counties, 40 districts, 345 townships, and 3,078 cooperatives with an average yield of over 700 jin per mu. These facts have prompted comrades with the idea that "production increases have reached their limit" to clear their minds. They said, "Production increases have not only not reached their limit, but there is no limit at all." The Party committees of Suzhou and Songjiang regions, located in the Yangtze River Delta, have already set plans to strive to achieve an average rice yield of 1,000 jin per mu within seven years!

The "Lixiahe region" in central Jiangsu has fertile soil and good natural conditions. However, before the Huai River was harnessed, it suffered from varying degrees of flooding every year. Most of the farmland was waterlogged year-round, and only one crop could be cultivated. In order to harvest a crop of rice before the flood season, farmers planted only short-maturity, inferior early rice varieties, with a yield of only 200 jin per mu. Harnessing the Huai River has greatly changed the water conservancy conditions of the region's 10 million mu of land. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, Yangzhou Prefectural Party Committee, and Yancheng Prefectural Party Committee decided to promote it as a high-yield rice and wheat area. After achieving a bumper harvest in 1954 under conditions of extreme flooding, the local Party committees proposed measures to increase production by converting single-crop flooded fields into double-crop rice and wheat fields. However, this was opposed by many people with conservative ideas. They believed that "flooded fields" have existed throughout history and cannot be converted into dry land, and even if yields are to be increased, it must be done slowly. Taixian County, which has 240,000 mu of "flooded fields," only planned to convert 40,000 mu, and there was no action taken. The Xinghua County Party Committee broke through this conservative thinking. They chose the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiang'exiang to actively carry out production reforms. The Red Star Cooperative is located in the lowest-lying area of the entire district. The victory in fighting the floods in 1954 increased the confidence of the cooperative members in overcoming natural disasters. The Communist Party members in the cooperative took the lead in organizing shock brigades to drain all the 1.8 chi deep year-round waterlogged fields in the Xibashixu, spread ashes, and planted wheat. As a result, the average wheat yield was 163 jin per mu, and the best yield was 378 jin per mu. In the autumn, the rice also achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 553 jin per mu. The total yield of rice and wheat was 716 jin. Among them, 4.3 mu of land yielded a total of 953 jin of rice and wheat per mu. The cooperative members were not satisfied with this. They found eight major shortcomings in this high-yield field of 953 jin per mu and wanted to continue to improve it. After careful calculations, they put forward the following production increase plan: by 1957, the yield of single-crop fields in the entire cooperative will all reach 1,050 jin per mu, and the yield of double-crop rice and wheat fields will be 1,325 jin per mu. The Red Star Cooperative's practice of "converting flooded fields into dry fields" has become the direction for the entire "Lixiahe region" to reform its farming system and strive for increased production. Currently, these two districts are carrying out large-scale "flooded field conversion to dry field" work.

North of the Huai River Irrigation Main Canal is the vast plain of Xuzhou and Huaiyin. The water conservancy conditions here are poor, the farming is extensive, and the land utilization rate is low. However, in 1954, under severe flood conditions, this area achieved a bumper harvest. Xuzhou district alone increased grain production by 400 million jin. New signs have also appeared in agricultural production in 1955. The Cangji Agricultural Production Cooperative in Siyang County on the Xuhuai Plain has increased production by more than 50% annually since its establishment in 1952. The land of poor peasants has increased five times compared to before joining the cooperative, and the average yield per mu of the entire cooperative has increased from about 200 jin to 400 jin. Why is this cooperative able to achieve such a leap in production on barren land? According to the Party Committee's inspection, it is because the cooperative director, Dai Yucai, has a spirit of innovation, and all the crops in the cooperative are improved varieties. All the land in the cooperative is cultivated with double-wheel double-plow plows, and the "overlapping cultivation" method is used, with deep plowing reaching eight cun. The fact that this cooperative has increased production has powerfully refuted those who advocate the "backward region" theory. After the Huaiyin district introduced the Cangji Cooperative's experience in increasing production, the responsible comrades of several counties all examined themselves and said: The land of the Cangji Cooperative is the same as ours. They can achieve a yield of 520 jin per mu in 1956. Why can't we? We didn't go to the masses, we didn't see advanced things, and we couldn't lead the masses forward.

The land on the Xuhuai Plain is perfectly suited for cotton cultivation. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, considering the overall situation, decided to gradually promote cotton planting in the Xuzhou and Huaiyin areas, and gradually reduce the cotton planting area in the Nantong and Songjiang areas, which are suitable for growing grain.

In the past, the rich resources of the Maoshan and Tianmu Mountain areas in the southwest of the province were also not paid attention to for development and utilization. In the future, livestock husbandry should be developed there in a planned way, and economic forests, timber forests, water source forests, as well as mulberry, tea, oil tea, tung oil trees, fruit trees, etc., should be planted.

From the above situation, although Jiangsu Province's grain and cotton have already completed the First Five-Year Plan's production increase targets ahead of schedule, agricultural production still has infinite potential. Recently, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China examined and criticized the conservative thinking in the leadership work that lagged behind reality, and initially determined the province's agricultural collectivization, agricultural production goals, and comprehensive plans for various rural tasks. The grain production target has been further increased: it will reach 28 billion jin in 1957, an increase of 5.3 billion jin compared to 1955; it will reach 45 billion jin in 1962. At that time, the average grain yield per mu south of the Huai River in the province will be about 800 jin, and the grain yield per mu north of the Huai River will be about 500 jin. Within 1967, the area south of the Huai River will reach 1,000 jin per mu. In 1957, the cotton yield per unit area will also increase from an average of 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1955 to 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu, increasing to 80 jin in 1962, and to 110 jin in 1967.

Of course, advanced production increase plans do not mean reckless advancement. Currently, there are also individual areas where the phenomenon of blindly pursuing excessively high grain and cotton production targets regardless of subjective and objective conditions is occurring. The entire fish pond area in Luzhi District, Wuxian County, can only raise 100,000 freshwater fish, but the district Party committee plans to raise 210,000. This tendency to be divorced from reality must also be prevented and corrected.

In order to effectively achieve the grain and cotton production increase targets, the province has formulated a series of production increase measures. Currently, large-scale water conservancy projects have been fully launched, and the earthwork volume in winter has exceeded the total of the past six years. In the near future, Baoying Lake will become fertile land, and countless self-flowing irrigation areas will be formed on both sides of the Grand Canal and Chuanchang River, and the flood disasters of the Huai River will be transformed into water conservancy. Within five years, the province will eliminate general water and drought disasters; within six years, it will eliminate various crop diseases and insect pests. In 1957, Shuyang and Nantong counties will basically implement mechanized farming, and the province will also complete semi-mechanized farming.

    江苏农业生产有无穷的潜力
    本报记者　甄为民
    1955年，江苏省的粮食和棉花的总产量都已经大大超过了第一个五年计划最后一年——1957年的国家指标。粮食超过指标22，000万斤；棉花超过指标128万担。
    江苏省粮食棉花产量提前超过第一个五年计划指标的事实，充分证明了农业生产上有无穷的潜力。
    江苏省大体可分三类地区。
    长江三角洲上的太湖地区是水稻高产区，有良好的自然条件，增产潜力很大。在制定1955年增产计划的时候，江苏省委和松江地委、苏州地委对这个地区的增产潜力作了全面调查。调查的结果说明，这个地区还有25％的土地只种一季水稻，不种麦子，如果收了水稻再种上麦子，就可以增产不少粮食；这个地区的水稻品种有一半以上是低产的早中籼稻，如果改种高产稳收的晚粳稻，就可以从根本上避免三化螟虫的为害，每亩增产100斤以上。1954年秋，中共昆山县委批判了保守思想以后，大胆地发动群众在螟害严重的昆山南部16个乡的15万亩土地上，全面改种晚粳稻，并且做到了“虫害发生在哪里就消灭在哪里”，结果全面获得丰收，每亩多收稻谷100多斤。整个太湖地区1955年仅发动改种晚粳稻一项措施，就多增产了12，000万斤粮食。奉贤县改进了粮食、棉花和绿肥作物的轮作制度，提倡一年二熟和两年五熟，1955年基本上消灭了冬闲田，复种指数由137％提高到191％。已经有好几处地方试种双季稻的经验证明，推广双季稻可以使水稻产量向前跃进一步。金山县米市乡浩光农业生产合作社试种的1亩9分双季稻，每亩产量高达1，060斤。这些农业生产上的改革，使太湖地区出现了许多大面积丰产的典型。每亩平均产量超过700斤的有两个县、40个区、345个乡、3，078个社。事实促使有“增产到顶”思想的同志清醒了头脑。他们说：“增产不但没有到顶，而且根本就没有顶。”处于长江三角洲的苏州地区和松江地区的党委已经定出计划，争取在7年内达到每亩水稻平均产量1，000斤的目标！
    江苏省中部的“里下河地区”，土质肥沃，自然条件也不错。可是，在治淮以前，年年遭到不同程度的水涝灾害，绝大部分农田常年积水，只能耕种一熟；农民为了赶在汛前收一季稻，全部种植成熟期很短的劣种早稻，每亩产量只有200多斤。治理淮河，使这个地区1，000多万亩土地的水利条件起了很大变化。因此，江苏省委和扬州地委，盐城地委决定把它提高为一个高产的稻麦区。1954年，在特大洪水条件下取得丰收以后，当地党委又提出了把一熟沤田改为稻麦二熟田的增产措施。这时，却遭到了许多有保守思想的人的反对；他们认为“沤田”是历史上就有的，没法改旱地，即使要提高产量也得慢慢来。有24万亩“沤田”的泰县只打算改4万亩，而且不见行动。兴化县委打破了这种保守思想。他们选择蒋鹅乡的红星农业生产合作社积极进行生产改革。红星社处于全专区最低洼的地方，1954年同洪水做斗争的胜利，提高了社员战胜自然灾害的信心。社里的共产党员带头组织突击队，把西八十圩里93亩田内的1尺8寸深的常年积水全部车出来，用棍子捣塘铺灰，种下了麦子。结果，平均每亩收麦163斤，顶好的每亩收了378斤。秋季，稻子又获丰收，平均每亩收稻谷553斤。稻麦合计收了716斤；其中有4亩3分田稻麦合计每亩收了953斤。社员们并没有因此满足，他们在这块每亩收953斤的丰产田里找出了八大缺点，要继续加以改进。他们经过精细的计算，提出了这样的增产规划：到1957年全社一熟田每亩产量全部达到1，050斤，二熟稻麦田每亩产1，325斤。红星社“沤田改旱田”的作法，已经成为整个“里下河地区”改革耕作制度争取增产的方向。现在，这两个专区正在开展大规模的“沤田改旱田”的工作。
    淮河灌溉总渠以北，是徐州、淮阴的大片平原。这里水利条件差，耕作粗放，土地利用率低。可是，1954年在严重水灾情况下，这个地区却获得丰产，仅徐州一个专区就超额增产了4亿斤粮食。1955年的农业生产也出现了新的气象。徐淮平原上的泗阳县仓集农业生产合作社，自1952年成立以来，年年增产50％以上，贫农的土地比入社前增产五倍，全社每亩平均产量从200斤左右增加到400斤。为什么这个社在贫瘠的土地上能够得到跳跃式的增产呢？根据党委的检查，是由于这个社社长戴玉才有革新精神，社里的农作物全部是良种；这个社里土地也全部使用双轮双铧犁耕种，并且采用“套耕”的办法，深耕达八寸。这个社的增产事实，有力地批驳了那些“地区落后”论者。淮阴专区介绍了仓集社的增产经验后，几个县的负责同志都检讨说：仓集社的土地和我们这里的一样，他们那里1956年每亩产量能达到520斤，我们这里为什么不能呢！我们没有到群众中去，看不到先进的东西，也就不能领导群众前进。
    徐淮平原的土地完全适宜于棉花的生长。江苏省委从全盘考虑，决定逐步在徐州、淮阴地区推广植棉，并且逐步缩小适宜于种粮食的南通、松江地区的植棉面积。
    省内西南部茅蔍山和天目山山区丰富的资源过去也没有注意开发和利用，今后要有计划地在那里发展牧畜业，种植经济林、用材林、水源林以及蚕桑、茶树、油茶、油桐、果树等。
    从以上情况看，江苏省的粮食棉花虽然已经提前完成了第一个五年计划的增产指标，但是农业生产仍然蕴藏着无穷的潜力。最近，中共江苏省委根据党中央的指示，检查和批判了领导工作中思想落后于实际的保守思想，初步确定了全省农业合作化、农业生产的奋斗目标和农村各项工作的全面规划。粮食产量指标已经进一步提高：1957年将达到280亿斤，比1955年增产53亿斤；1962年将达到450亿斤。那时，全省淮河以南每亩平均产粮食800斤左右，淮河以北产粮食500斤左右。1967年以内，淮河以南将达到每亩1，000斤。1957年，棉花单位面积产量也将由1955年的平均每亩40斤皮棉增加到60斤皮棉，1962年提高到80斤，1967年提高到110斤。
    当然，增产计划的先进并不等于冒进，目前也有个别地区发生不顾主客观条件，盲目追求过高的粮棉增产指标的现象。吴县甪直区全部鱼池只能养淡水鱼10万尾，而区委却计划要养21万尾。这种脱离实际的倾向也要防止和纠正。
    为了切实实现粮棉增产指标，全省制定了一系列的增产措施。目前，大规模的水利工程已经全面开展，冬季的土方数字超过了过去6年的总和。不久的将来，宝应湖将要变成良田，运河、串场河两岸将形成无数个自流灌溉区，淮河水害将变成水利。五年内，全省将消灭一般性的水旱灾害；6年内将要消灭各种农作物的病虫害。1957年，沭阳、南通两县将基本上实行机械化耕作，全省也将完成半机械化的耕作。
