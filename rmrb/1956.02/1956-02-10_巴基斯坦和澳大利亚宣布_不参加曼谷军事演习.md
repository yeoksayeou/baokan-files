    So far, only the United States, the Philippines, and Thailand out of the 8 countries participating in the American-controlled Manila Treaty Organization have announced that they will participate in this exercise.
    According to the Thai "Thai Mai Daily," the countries of the Manila Treaty Organization have differences of opinion on how this military bloc should operate. The United States "hopes to concentrate its efforts on military preparations," while other countries advocate for more economic aid.

    据新华社讯　巴基斯坦外交部发言人8日说，巴基斯坦将不参加马尼拉条约组织15日至18日在曼谷附近举行的军事演习。在此以前，澳大利亚国防部长麦克布莱德已经在2月7日宣布，澳大利亚部队将不参加这一次演习。
    到现在为止，参加美国控制的马尼拉条约组织的8个国家中只有美国、菲律宾和泰国已经宣布要参加这次演习。
    据泰国“泰迈报”透露，马尼拉条约组织各国对这个军事集团如何进行活动发生了分歧意见。美国“希望集中力量从事军事准备”，而其他国家主张实行更多的经济援助。
