    Agricultural tool repair work is an important link in promoting new-style agricultural tools, boosting agricultural production, and supporting the agricultural cooperation movement. In the past, Hebei Province did not pay enough attention to this work. Farmers had no place to repair their broken agricultural tools. Even if they found a place to repair them, it was either too far away, or the repair quality was low and the cost high. Farmers had many complaints about this, especially after the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, these complaints became more numerous and sharper.

    In order to meet the needs of farmers, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed last year that an agricultural tool repair network must be established in a planned way. Industrial conferences at all levels have also put the agricultural tool repair work on an important agenda, and carried out publicity and education among all employees of relevant units, so that everyone can recognize the importance of doing a good job in agricultural tool repair work. Then, investigations and studies were conducted at the county level. Based on the number of agricultural production cooperatives in each area, the number of major agricultural tools of agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers, and the size and technical conditions of iron and wood equipment in local industries (including local state-owned industries, cooperative-run industries, joint state-private industries, handicraft production cooperatives and individual handicrafts), a comprehensive plan was made to establish an agricultural tool repair network. The organizational form of this repair network is to establish a central repair station in each county with a well-equipped and technically proficient iron factory as the core, responsible for repairing new-style agricultural tools and imparting technology; around the central repair station, several repair groups or repair points are set up according to the characteristics of each economic region and the number of agricultural tools, to undertake the task of repairing agricultural tools in a certain area; fixed repair groups or repair points are generally set up in small towns and market places to facilitate farmers to find them. In addition, various mobile repair teams were organized to go deep into the countryside and agricultural production cooperatives to carry out repairs in a planned way. Experience has proved that this organizational form can not only take into account the technical conditions of local industrial enterprises and handicraftsmen, and give them appropriate division of labor; but also adapt to the different requirements of various economic regions. According to this organizational form, as of October last year, the province had established a total of 1,505 agricultural tool repair stations and repair groups; more than 6,300 members of iron and wood handicraft production cooperatives and more than 820 individual handicraftsmen were organized into the repair network.

    After the agricultural tool repair network is established, how to carry out business? According to the preliminary experience of Hebei Province, the following tasks should be done well:

    First, widely carry out publicity work, using publicity forms such as posting advertisements, rooftop broadcasting, repair groups going to the countryside to hang signs, visiting, and explaining at various meetings, so that farmers know that the agricultural tool repair network is to serve them. A repair group in the third district of Ding County used rooftop broadcasting in the evening to carry out publicity, and farmers brought agricultural tools and other production tools to the repair group for repair. In 20 days, this group repaired 275 new-style agricultural tools and 2,010 old-style agricultural tools and other tools in one township, earning 1,633 yuan in repair and processing fees.

    Secondly, it is necessary to achieve "quality assurance, warranty, and fair prices." This is the key to carrying out and expanding repair business. Wang Huaijun, the leader of the Dongcheji repair group in Ding County, went to the countryside once and learned that some of the previously repaired works had soft steel and the quality was not good, so he voluntarily took back the work and repaired it again. As a result, the credibility of the repair group was improved, and 52 agricultural production cooperatives in 20 nearby villages signed annual repair contracts with the group.

    Third, agricultural tool repair work should be coordinated with the seasonality of agricultural production to avoid delaying agricultural time; and the habit of "no office on Sundays and evenings" should be changed to "repair in the morning if brought in the morning, repair in the evening if brought in the evening." During the locust catching in the summer of last year, the agricultural tool repair station in Dingxing County dispatched all repair personnel overnight to the locust catching area to repair locust catching tools for farmers, and also helped farmers catch locusts, which strongly supported the successful completion of the locust catching task in Dingxing County.

    Fourth, in order to continuously improve repair quality, improve work efficiency, and reduce repair costs, repair personnel must be organized to actively learn technology. Especially in the initial stage of the establishment of the agricultural tool repair network, the technical level of repair personnel varies, some can only repair this kind of agricultural tool and cannot repair that kind of agricultural tool, and it is even more difficult to repair new-style agricultural tools. Therefore, organizing technical learning is even more important. Hebei Province has adopted small technical training classes, technical research conferences and technical research groups, as well as the method of masters teaching apprentices or explaining, watching, and practicing at the same time, which have all achieved good results.

    Fifth, actively sign repair contracts with agricultural production cooperatives. Signing repair contracts can undertake a large number of businesses, and also fix the repair business, which is convenient for reasonable arrangement and allocation in terms of technology, tools, and time, so that the repair work can be carried out in a planned way, avoiding unevenness of the repair group and blindly going to the countryside.

    The agricultural tool repair network is an organization that includes a variety of economic types, so the policy of "overall planning and unified arrangement" must be implemented in the work. Only in this way can we give play to the enthusiasm of private industry and individual handicraftsmen in serving agricultural production, and improve their awareness through repair activities, which is more convenient for carrying out socialist transformation on them.

    Although the agricultural tool repair network in Hebei Province has achieved some of the above-mentioned achievements and experiences, there are still many shortcomings, such as the uneven distribution of the agricultural tool repair network in the region, the phenomenon of low repair quality and high prices still exists seriously in some areas, and there are still phenomena of excluding private industry and individual handicraftsmen in some repair network organizations, which need to be improved in the future.

    Handicraftsmen in Qingdao City who have been cooperativized have recently successfully trial-produced 5 kinds of new agricultural tools. This is the Iron Industry Production Cooperative testing the effectiveness of the horse-drawn seeder in Laoshan, a suburb of Qingdao, and soliciting opinions from farmers.

    河北省的农具修配网
    赵玉清
    农具修配工作是推广新式农具、促进农业增产、支援农业合作化运动的一个重要环节。过去，河北省对这个工作重视不够，农民的农具坏了没地方修理，即便找到了修理的地方，不是路太远，就是修理的质量低，费用高。对于这一点，农民们有很多意见，特别在农业合作化高潮到来以后，这方面的意见就更多和更加尖锐。
    为了满足农民的要求，去年中共河北省委提出了必须有计划地建立农具修配网。各级工业会议也都把农具修配工作提到重要的日程上来，并且在有关单位的全体职工中进行宣传教育，使大家认识做好农具修配工作的重要性。然后，以县为单位进行调查研究，根据各地农业生产合作社的数量，农业生产合作社和个体农民主要农具的数量，地方工业（包括地方国营工业、合作社营工业、公私合营工业、手工业生产社和个体手工业）中铁、木业的设备大小和技术条件高低，来全面规划和建立农具修配网。这个修配网的组织形式，是在每一县中，以一个设备较好、技术较高的铁工厂为核心组成中心修配站，负责修配新式农具和传授技术；围绕中心修配站，根据各个经济区域的特点和农具的多寡分设若干修配组或修配点，担负一定地区的农具修配任务；在小城镇和集市地方一般都设有固定的修配组或修配点，以便于农民来找。此外，还组织了各种流动修配小组，有计划地深入农村和农业生产合作社巡回修理。经验证明，这种组织形式既能照顾到地方工业企业和手工业者的技术条件，给以适当的分工；又能适应各种不同经济地区的不同要求。按照这种组织形式，至去年10月份为止，全省共建立了1，505个农具修配站和修配小组；组织到修配网里来的，有6，300多个铁、木业手工业生产合作社社员和820多个个体手工业者。
    农具修配网建立以后，如何开展业务呢？根据河北省的初步经验，应该做好以下几项工作：
    首先是广泛地开展宣传工作，利用贴广告、屋顶广播、修配组下乡挂牌子、访问，以及在各种会议上讲解等宣传形式，使农民知道农具修配网是为他们服务的。定县第三区一个修配组下乡利用晚间屋顶广播进行了宣传后，农民纷纷拿出农具和其他生产工具让修配组修理。这个组在20天里，在一个乡内修理了新式农具275件，旧式农具和其他工具2，010件，得到修理加工费1，633元。
    其次要做到“保质，保修，价钱公道”。这是开展和扩大修配业务的关键。定县东车寄修配组组长王怀君有一次下乡，了解到以前修理的活有的钢软，质量不好，就自动把活收回来重新修理。结果，修配组的威信提高了，附近20个村52个农业生产合作社都同这个组订立了常年的修配合同。
    第三，农具修配工作应该配合农业生产的季节性，做到不误农时；并且要改变“星期日和晚上不办公”的习惯，做到“早上拿来早上修，晚上拿来晚上修”。定兴县的农具修配站在去年夏天捕蝗的时候，全体修配人员连夜出发，赶到捕蝗的地方给农民修理捕蝗工具，还帮助农民捕蝗，有力地支持了定兴县捕蝗任务的胜利完成。
    第四，为了不断提高修配质量，提高工作效率，降低修配成本，必须组织修配人员积极学习技术。特别在农具修配网建立初期，修配人员技术水平有高有低，有的只会修理这种农具而不会修理那种农具，修理新式农具更感到困难。因此，组织技术学习就更加重要。河北省采取小型技术训练班、技术研究会和技术研究小组，以及师傅带徒弟或边讲、边看、边实习等办法，都收到很好的效果。
    第五是积极同农业生产合作社签订包修合同。签订包修合同可以大量承揽业务，也可以把修配业务固定下来，便于在技术上、工具上、时间上合理安排和调配，使修配工作有计划地进行，避免修配组忙闲不均，盲目下乡。
    农具修配网是包括多种经济类型的组织，因此在工作中必须贯彻执行“统筹兼顾、统一安排”的方针。这样才能发挥私营工业和个体手工业为农业生产服务的积极性，才能通过修配活动，提高他们的觉悟，更便于对他们实行社会主义改造。
    河北省的农具修配网工作虽然取得了上述一些成绩和经验，但是缺点还是很多的，如农具修配网在地区分布上还不平衡，修配质量低、价格高的现象还在某些地区严重地存在，在某些修配网组织中还有排斥私营工业和个体手工业的现象，这些都有待今后改进。（附图片）
    青岛市合作化了的手工业者，最近试制成功5种新农具。这是铁业生产合作社在青岛郊区嶗山试验马拉播种机的效能，征求农民们的意见。
