Cambodia is one of the three countries of Indochina. It is located in the southern part of the Indochinese Peninsula, covering an area of 181,000 square kilometers with a population of over 4 million.

The west, north, and east of Cambodia are mountainous and plateau areas covered with dense forests. The central part is a basin formed by the Mekong River alluvial deposits, centered around the Tonle Sap Lake. Like the Nile River in Egypt, the Mekong River floods regularly every year, making the Cambodian basin very fertile. Most of Cambodia's important cities and 80% of the national population are concentrated around Tonle Sap Lake and along the banks of the Mekong River. The capital, Phnom Penh, with 260,000 residents, is located at the confluence of Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong River.

The tropical climate and abundant rainfall brought by the annual rainy season provide Cambodia with excellent natural conditions for agriculture. The main products are rice, corn, and rubber, followed by pepper, kapok, tobacco, beans, cardamom, etc. The livestock industry ranks second in Southeast Asia; the number of cattle raised alone is 1.4 million, with 60,000 to 70,000 heads exported annually. Under the long-term colonial rule of France, Cambodia's industry is underdeveloped, with only some small-scale agricultural product processing industries. The country's mineral deposits have not been well explored. Currently, only phosphate mines and ruby and sapphire mines are being exploited.

Cambodia was founded at the beginning of the Christian era. From the 10th to the 12th centuries, it was once a wealthy and powerful country in Southeast Asia. Cambodia has a long and brilliant ancient culture. The famous Angkor monuments scattered north of Tonle Sap Lake and along the Siem Reap River are remnants of Cambodia's ancient civilization. The most famous are the ancient city of Angkor and Angkor Wat. The ancient city of Angkor was built between 860 and 900 AD. The entire stone city wall is 14 kilometers long, and the city contains magnificent palaces and temples. Later, it was mostly destroyed during the invasion of the Siamese Dynasty in the 15th century. Angkor Wat is mostly made of stone, with towering pagodas and pavilions. The corridors and stone pillars are carved with many Buddha statues and exquisite reliefs, which are precious crystallizations of Cambodia's best-preserved sculptural art. Most Cambodians believe in Buddhism. There are more than 2,700 temples of various sizes throughout the country, with approximately 80,000 monks.

In 1863, French colonists invaded Cambodia and declared Cambodia a French "protectorate." Cambodia suffered French colonial rule for 90 years. During this period, Japanese militarists also occupied Cambodia during World War II. For 90 years, the Cambodian people have never ceased their struggle for national liberation.

The Indochina armistice agreement reached at the Geneva Conference in July 1954 ended France's colonial wars in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. In the Geneva Accords, the French government declared that it would withdraw its troops from Cambodia and resolve issues with Cambodia based on respect for Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity. The participating countries also made guarantees to safeguard Cambodia's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity. At the same time, the Cambodian government also declared that it would not enter into any agreement with other countries that would include obligations to join military alliances that are inconsistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter, or that would include the establishment of bases for foreign military forces on Cambodian territory when its security is not threatened. The Cambodian government also declared its determination not to request foreign assistance regarding military supplies, personnel, and instructors, except for the purpose of effectively defending its territory.

In September 1955, the Kingdom of Cambodia held elections, elected a new National Assembly, and formed a new government. According to the Cambodian Constitution, Cambodia is a constitutional monarchy. The king is the head of state, and under the king there are the National Assembly, the Cabinet, and the High Court, which respectively exercise legislative, executive, and judicial powers. The current king is Suramarit.

In terms of foreign relations, Cambodia continues to maintain close relations with France. Cambodia has signed an agreement with the United States to receive U.S. military aid. After the Geneva Conference, Cambodia's relations with Asian countries such as India have further developed. In April 1955, Cambodia participated in the first Asian-African Conference held in Bandung. At the Asian-African Conference, Cambodian representative Prince Sihanouk expressed acceptance of the various principles of peaceful coexistence, guaranteeing that Cambodia would adhere to neutrality and would not allow Cambodia to be used as a base for aggression. Subsequently, the Cambodian government also announced Cambodia's determination not to establish military alliances with foreign countries, not to provide military bases to foreign countries, and not to allow foreign countries to use Cambodia as a military transit station. Recently, Prince Sihanouk, during his visit to the Philippines, rejected the invitation for Cambodia to join the Manila Treaty. On December 16, 1955, Cambodia and 15 other countries were simultaneously admitted as members of the United Nations.

China and Cambodia are close neighbors. The two countries have a long history of friendly relations. As early as the beginning of the 3rd century AD, there were exchanges between the two countries. During the Southern and Sui Dynasties, Cambodian monks and musicians came to China one after another. After the Tang Dynasty, various dynasties traded with Cambodia. Cambodia supplied China with ivory, spices, beeswax, raw silk, etc. China also transported a wide variety of goods to Cambodia, including gold and silver, colorful silk fabrics, lacquerware, and porcelain, which were loved by Cambodian residents. At present, there are approximately 300,000 overseas Chinese in Cambodia, who have long established deep friendships with the Cambodian people. Contacts were established between the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia at the Geneva Conference and the Bandung Conference. Prince Sihanouk's visit to China will surely enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries.

    柬埔寨介绍
    柬埔寨是印度支那三个国家之一。它位于印度支那半岛的南部，面积181，000平方公里，人口400多万人。
    柬埔寨西部、北部和东部是复盖着茂密森林的山地和高原，中部是湄公河冲积而成的以洞里湖为中心的盆地。像埃及的尼罗河一样，湄公河每年定期泛滥，使柬埔寨盆地非常肥沃。柬埔寨大部分的重要城市和全国80％的人口都集中在洞里湖周围和湄公河两岸。拥有26万居民的首都金边就位于洞里湖和湄公河的汇合处。
    热带气候和每年雨季带来的充足雨量，使柬埔寨农业具有优厚的自然条件。产品以大米、玉米、橡胶为主，其次是胡椒、木棉、烟草、豆类、豆蔻等。畜牧业在东南亚居第二位，仅仅饲养的耕牛就有140万头，每年输出6、7万头。在法国的长期的殖民统治之下，柬埔寨的工业不发达，只有一些小规模农产品加工工业。境内的矿藏还没有很好勘察，现在开采的只有磷酸盐矿和红、蓝玉石矿。
    柬埔寨建国于公元初年。在10世纪到12世纪间曾经是东南亚一个富强的国家。柬埔寨具有悠久、灿烂的古代文化。散布在洞里湖北面、暹粒河两岸的著名吴哥古迹，是柬埔寨古代文明的遗物。其中最著名的是吴哥古都和吴哥寺。吴哥古都建于860到900年间，全部石砌的城墙长14公里，城内建有宏伟的王宫和庙宇。后来在15世纪暹罗王朝入侵时大部被毁。吴哥寺大部由石头砌成，高塔楼阁耸立，回廊四壁和石柱上都刻有许多佛像和奇巧的浮雕，是保存得最好的柬埔寨雕刻艺术的珍贵结晶。柬埔寨居民大部分信奉佛教，全国有大小寺院2，700多所，僧人约80，000人。
    1863年，法国殖民者侵占柬埔寨，宣布柬埔寨为法国的“保护国”。柬埔寨遭受法国殖民统治先后达90年之久，其间日本军国主义者在第二次世界大战期间也曾一度侵占柬埔寨。90年来，柬埔寨人民一直没有停止过争取民族解放的斗争。
    1954年7月在日内瓦会议上达成的印度支那停战协议，结束了法国在越南、老挝和柬埔寨进行的殖民战争。在日内瓦协议中，法国政府声明要把它的军队撤出柬埔寨，并且在尊重柬埔寨的独立、主权、统一和领土完整的基础上来解决与柬埔寨的问题。与会各国也作出维护柬埔寨的主权、独立、统一和领土完整的保证。同时柬埔寨政府也声明它将不与其他国家缔结任何包括参加不符合于联合国宪章原则的军事同盟的义务，或者包括当它的安全不受威胁时在柬埔寨领土上为外国军事力量建立基地的义务的协定。柬埔寨政府并且声明，决心不要求关于军事物资、人员和教官的外国援助，除非为了有效地保卫本国领土的目的。
    1955年9月，柬埔寨王国举行选举，选出新的国民议会并且组成了新的政府。按照柬埔寨宪法，柬埔寨是君主立宪的国家。国王是国家元首，国王以下设有国会、内阁、高级法院，分别掌管立法、行政、司法三权。现在的国王是苏拉马里特。
    在对外关系方面，柬埔寨同法国继续保持着密切的关系。柬埔寨同美国签订了接受美国军事援助的协定。在日内瓦会议以后，柬埔寨和印度等亚洲国家的关系有了进一步的发展。1955年4月，柬埔寨参加了在万隆举行的第一次亚非会议。在亚非会议上，柬埔寨代表西哈努克亲王表示接受和平共处各项原则，保证柬埔寨坚守中立并且不使柬埔寨被用为进行侵略的基地。此后，柬埔寨政府又曾宣布柬埔寨决心不同外国建立军事同盟，不向外国提供军事基地，不许外国把柬埔寨作为军事转运站。最近，西哈努克亲王在访问菲律宾的时候又拒绝了要柬埔寨参加马尼拉条约的邀请。1955年12月16日，柬埔寨和其他15个国家同时被接纳为联合国会员国。
    中国和柬埔寨是近邻。两国之间有着悠久的友好关系。早在公元3世纪初，两国之间就开始有了来往。南朝和隋朝时，先后有柬埔寨僧人和乐工到中国来。唐代以后各朝都同柬埔寨互通贸易。柬埔寨供应中国象牙、香料、黄腊、生丝等。中国也运给柬埔寨种类繁多的商品，其中包括柬埔寨居民喜爱的金银、五色绢绸、漆器、瓷器等。目前，中国在柬埔寨的华侨约有30万人，他们同柬埔寨人民早已建立了深厚的友谊。在日内瓦会议和万隆会议上，中华人民共和国政府代表团和柬埔寨王国政府代表团之间建立了联系。西哈努克亲王这次到中国访问，必将增进两国之间的了解和友谊。
