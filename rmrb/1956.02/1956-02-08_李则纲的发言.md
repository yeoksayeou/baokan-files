Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

In Chairman Zhou's political report, it was specifically instructed that "this meeting is prepared to focus on discussing the issue of intellectuals," and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo also delivered a report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of the socialist revolution. In addition to my heartfelt endorsement, as a worker in cultural and educational fields and also as a member of a democratic party, I cannot help but deeply examine and understand myself.

Speaking of the issue of arrangement and utilization, I engaged in cultural and educational work in the old society for more than 30 years, from primary school teacher to university professor. Although my position as a teacher gradually rose, the hardships and difficulties remained the same. My profession was not guaranteed, and I received no care when I was sick. There was little warmth to be found anywhere. Especially during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, secret agent students were all around, spying and probing. A careless word could lead to unemployment or imprisonment, and I was constantly under mental threat. It was truly difficult to describe. After liberation, personally, I deeply felt that I had been liberated in the same way as workers and peasants, so my heart was filled with indescribable joy. I was originally a weak and sickly person, but now people say that I am much more energetic and much fatter. Yes, when a person has no worries and no troubles, why wouldn't they gain weight? The ancients said, "A broad mind makes a fat body." This saying is very true.

Comparing the treatment of intellectuals after liberation with that before liberation is like comparing heaven and earth. Today, Chairman Zhou also said that some state organs and state personnel of the government "still have some shortcomings in their treatment of intellectuals." Hearing this, I was truly moved to tears! I think people like me feel the same way!

I am a member of a democratic party, and under the leadership of the Party, I lead some of the work of the democratic party. In the past six years, I have made very little progress in self-reform, and the role I have played in uniting and educating intellectuals is even more negligible. Upon reflection, I am truly ashamed. In the future, I can only follow the method of the three "self-reflections" introduced by Vice Chairman Guo every day, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, redouble my efforts to improve my political and professional level, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party, and strive to realize Chairman Mao's great call – "We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture!"

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to put forward some immature opinions and hopes. I am now a cultural relics worker, and the Party has given me the responsibility of preparing for the Anhui Museum. From each exhibition, I deeply know that the broad masses of workers and peasants greatly love the motherland's cultural heritage created by the wisdom of the working people – "historical relics." They often leave such words in the suggestion book: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, how could we see these precious things," "Seeing an exhibition is like receiving an education in patriotism, and we must do a good job in production for the construction of the motherland!" These words are truly good! If it weren't for liberation, these things would all be hidden deep in the homes of bureaucrats and landlords. How could they be open to the public? How could ordinary people have the opportunity to see these things? Through the rich and intuitive perception of the images of the motherland's cultural relics, it can indeed inspire the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. It is a pity that tens of thousands of our country's precious cultural relics have been stolen by American imperialism. This shameless crime of the United States has aroused our great indignation. When Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan, he also transported away a large number of ancient Chinese cultural relics that cannot be estimated in value. These are the cultural heritages accumulated by the countless working people of our country over thousands of years, and no loss can be allowed. Chairman Zhou's report on the methods announced for the liberation of Taiwan can be said to be truly benevolent and righteous to the Kuomintang military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan, fully demonstrating the Party and the government's magnanimity and consistent pursuit of the spirit of peace, which I very much support. At the same time, we must warn them to resolutely protect the ancestral cultural relics that were transported there and not allow them to be transported to the United States or seized by the United States. If they are not properly protected, they will be held accountable by the people of the motherland in the future.

We must fight to support the liberation of Taiwan!

We hope that the ancestral cultural relics existing in Taiwan and Taiwan, the ancestral territory, will return to the embrace of the motherland completely!

    李则纲的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在周主席政治报告中，特别指示“这次会议准备著重地讨论关于知识分子问题”，郭沫若副主席并作了在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告。我除衷心地拥护外，作为文教工作者同时又是一个民主党派成员，不能不深自检查和体会。
    谈到安排使用问题，我在旧社会从事文教工作30多年，从小学教师到大学教授，虽然教书的地位逐渐上升，但是艰难困苦，始终如一。职业无保障，疾病无照顾，那里得到一点温暖。尤其在蒋介石统治时代，特务学生，环伺刺探，一言不慎，就有失业坐牢的危险，时时刻刻受着精神威胁，真是难以言语形容。解放以后，在我个人，深深感到是和工人、农民同样地被解放了，所以心里，真是说不出来的愉快。我本是一个体弱多病的人，现在人家都说我的精神健旺得多，身体胖得多。是的，一个人没有忧虑，没有苦闷，为什么不胖呢。古人说“心广体胖”，这句话真很有道理。
    拿解放后和解放前，知识分子所受的待遇来对照，真是天渊之别。今天周主席还说，政府某些国家机关和国家工作人员，“对待知识分子方面还有一些缺点”，真叫我听了，感激涕零！我想和我同样的人，也有同感！
    我是一个民主党派成员，在党的领导下，领导一部分民主党派的工作。六年以来，在自我改造方面，进步很少，在团结教育知识分子方面起的作用更是微不足道。检查起来，真是愧汗无地。今后只有遵照郭副主席所介绍的每日三个“自省”的办法，在中国共产党领导下，加倍努力，提高政治水平和业务水平，紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，为实现毛主席的伟大号召——“我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”——而奋斗！
    最后我想借这个机会，提出我一点不成熟的意见和希望。我现在是个文物工作者，党给我负着安徽博物馆筹备处的责任。从每次展览中，深知广大的工农群众非常热爱劳动人民智慧所创造的祖国文化遗产——“历史文物”，常在意见簿上留下这样的话：“不是毛主席，我们那能看到这些宝贵的东西”、“我看了一次展览，等于受了一次爱国主义的教育，一定要为祖国建设搞好生产！”这些话，真不错！不是解放，这些东西都是深藏在官僚地主家里，那能向社会公开？普通的人，那有看到这些东西的眼福？通过丰富的祖国文物形象的直觉观感，确能启发广大人民的爱国热情，可惜的，我国珍贵的文物被美帝国主义盗窃去的数以万计，美国这种无耻的罪行，已激起我们非常痛愤。蒋介石逃往台湾的时候，又运走了大批的不可以价值估计的我国古代文物，这都是我国无量数的劳动人民千百年来所积累的文化遗产，不能允许有丝毫损失。周主席报告关于解放台湾问题所宣告的办法，对跑到台湾的国民党的军政人员，可说真是仁至义尽，充分地表现出党和政府的宽大和一贯地争取和平精神，这是我非常拥护的。同时我们要警告他们，对于运去的祖国文物，要坚决地护卫着，不要输送到美国或被美国夺走。如果不好好地保护，将来要受祖国人民的清算。
    我们要为支援解放台湾而奋斗！
    我们希望存在台湾的祖国文物和祖国领土的台湾，同样地完整地回到祖国怀抱！
