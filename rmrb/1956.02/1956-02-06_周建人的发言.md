Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and agree with all other reports.

After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report on intellectuals, I am deeply moved and extremely excited. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our country is currently in the midst of a great upsurge of the socialist revolution." Under such a new situation, the Party and the government have entrusted us intellectuals with a great new task, requiring us to contribute all our strength to socialism, and requiring us to raise the most urgently needed scientific departments in our country to a level close to the world's advanced level within 12 years. What a arduous and glorious task this is! I think that all patriotic intellectuals, upon hearing such a great call, cannot but feel joyful and encouraged.

Many of us intellectuals have had ideals and ambitions of "enriching the country and benefiting the people." However, in the old society, our ideals became empty dreams. We intellectuals had talent but no way to use it, a heart full of enthusiasm but no one to recognize it. Only after liberation did we see our ideals come true. The Party patiently educated and helped us, guiding us onto the bright and splendid road of socialism. Today, the Party has further pointed out the direction of our future efforts, and has thoughtfully and properly arranged all the necessary conditions for us to carry out our work smoothly. The Party's care and love for us is meticulous. We must unite more closely around the Party, exert the greatest initiative and creativity, and complete our glorious tasks. Only in this way can we live up to the Party and the people's deep expectations of us intellectuals!

A bright and splendid road is unfolding before us. How to make us advance more heroically and dedicate all our strength to the great motherland without reservation depends mainly on our further self-education and transformation. In the past six years, under the leadership of the Party, our intellectuals' ideological remolding has definitely made great achievements. However, ideological remolding has no end, and at the same time, due to the rapid development of the situation, we cannot be satisfied with some initial achievements. Otherwise, we will not be able to adapt to the rapidly changing situation and will eventually fall behind. We all came from the old society and should constantly be vigilant about our own shortcomings and problems. Today, the fundamental issue of our country is a matter of changing ownership. For intellectuals, it generally does not seem to involve the issue of ownership, but in fact, private ownership concepts and the ideas of the exploiting class are the root causes of all the shortcomings and problems of intellectuals. Just as capitalist ownership and individual ownership hinder the development of productive forces, the backward ideas of the exploiting class left over from the old society will inevitably hinder our progress and prevent us from serving socialism well. Therefore, we must be good at using the method of criticism and self-criticism to constantly criticize and overcome the various backward ideas of the exploiting class, and systematically strive to study Marxism-Leninism and establish a proletarian outlook on life and a scientific world outlook. Only when we are fully equipped with the proletarian spirit of selfless devotion to duty with unlimited loyalty and creativity in any position, and diligently cultivate the discipline that permeates all feelings and thoughts of the proletariat, can we intellectuals play a greater role in the cause of socialist construction. As long as we have ambition, we intellectuals can do this. Some time ago, the old playwright Ouyang Yuqian and the old scientist Liu Xianzhou gloriously joined the Party, which is a good example with great inspiring significance for us intellectuals. As the old saying goes: "Everyone can become Yao and Shun." We intellectuals should use this sentence to encourage and spur ourselves on. Therefore, I fully agree with Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's words: "Every intellectual should demand himself according to the standards of a Communist Party member." Only in this way, I believe, intellectuals will be able to exert their greatest strength and fulfill their arduous responsibilities in the cause of socialist construction and safeguarding peace in the motherland. I wish the alliance of intellectuals, workers and peasants will be increasingly consolidated, and achieve brilliant victories in the great socialist construction.

    周建人的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，并同意其它各项报告。
    听了周恩来主席的政治报告和郭沫若副主席关于知识分子问题的报告，我很感动，也无比兴奋。正如毛主席所指出的：“目前我国正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中。”在这样的新形势之下，党和政府又把一个伟大的新任务交付给我们知识分子，要求我们把一切力量贡献给社会主义，要求我们在12年内把我国最急需的科学部门提高到接近世界先进水平。这个任务是何等的艰巨，又是何等的光荣！我想凡是爱国的知识分子，听到这样伟大的召唤，无有不感到欢欣鼓舞的。
    我们很多知识分子都有过一番“富国裕民”的理想和抱负。然而在旧社会里我们的理想却变成了空想，我们知识分子空有一身本领而无从施展，空有一腔热忱而无从见知于人，只有到了解放以后，我们才亲眼看到我们的理想实现。党耐心地教育我们帮助我们，引导我们走上了光辉灿烂的社会主义的大道。今天，党更进一步地为我们指出了今后努力的方向，替我们周到地、妥善地安排好了顺利进行工作的一切必要条件。党对我们的关怀和爱护是无微不至的。我们一定要更加紧密地团结在党的周围，发挥最大的积极性和创造性，完成我们光荣的任务。这样才不辜负党和人民对我们知识分子深切的期待！
    我们前面展开着光明灿烂的大道，怎样使我们更加豪迈地前进，把我们一切力量毫不吝惜地献给伟大的祖国，主要还在于我们进一步地进行自我教育和改造。六年以来，在党的领导之下，我们知识分子的思想改造，肯定有很大的成绩。但是思想改造是没有止境的，同时由于形势的飞速发展，我们不能满足于初步的一些成绩。否则我们就不能跟一日千里的形势相适应，而终将越来越落在形势的后面。我们都是从旧社会来的，应该经常不断地警惕自己身上的缺点和毛病。今天我们国家的根本问题是一个改变所有制的问题，对于知识分子来说，一般似乎并不发生所有制的问题，但实际上，私有观念和剥削阶级的思想正是知识分子一切缺点和毛病的根源。犹如资本主义所有制和个体所有制阻碍生产力发展一样，旧社会遗留下来的剥削阶级的落后思想必然要妨碍我们前进，妨碍我们很好地为社会主义服务。因此我们必须善于用批评与自我批评的方法，不断地批判和克服剥削阶级的各种落后思想，并且有系统地努力学习马克思列宁主义，建立无产阶级的人生观和科学的世界观。我们只有完全具备了无产阶级那样在任何岗位上都无限忠诚地和创造性地履行自己职责的忘我精神，刻苦锻炼无产阶级那样渗透其全部感觉和思维的纪律性，我们知识分子才愈益能够在社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用。只要有志气，我们知识分子是可以做到这一点的。前些时候，老戏剧家欧阳予倩先生和老科学家刘仙洲先生等光荣地入了党，这对于我们知识分子是具有极大鼓舞意义的好榜样。古语说得好：“人皆可以为尧舜。”我们知识分子应该拿这句话来勉励、鞭策自己。所以我完全同意郭沫若副主席的话：“每一个知识分子都应当以共产党员的标准要求自己。”只要这样，我相信知识分子一定能够发挥最大的力量，完成在祖国社会主义建设和维护和平事业中的艰巨责任。我预祝知识分子和工人、农民的联盟日益巩固，在伟大的社会主义建设中取得光辉的胜利。
