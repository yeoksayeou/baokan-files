Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister Ghazi told reporters on January 31 that Syria, together with other Arab countries, is preparing to submit a joint memorandum to Eisenhower and Eden, who are currently holding talks in Washington. The memorandum will indicate that Arab countries refuse to recognize any decision regarding the Palestinian issue that has not received their consent.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the famous Egyptian journalist Farouk El-Gadi wrote in the Egyptian magazine "Life" that the Washington talks between Eisenhower and Eden will not solve the Middle East problem or establish peace in the Middle East. The purpose of their meeting is to coordinate their various colonial plans to exploit the people of all countries. The author emphasized that "the only threat to peace in the Middle East is colonialism."

Another Egyptian weekly, "Rose El Youssef," wrote in an editorial: "Eden and Eisenhower can meet and discuss what they want to discuss. But they cannot impose their will on the people of the Middle East. The people of the Middle East believe in peace and democracy, and they hope to implement a neutral policy and strive for industrialization in order to achieve economic independence and not have their resources controlled by foreigners. But the West is unwilling to recognize these basic demands of the people of the Middle East."

The Lebanese "Al Telegraph" published an article by Maiteni, the owner and editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stating that the talks held by Eden and Eisenhower to maintain British and American power in the Middle East will be an interference in the affairs and fate of independent Arab countries. No Arab would agree to Eden and Eisenhower consulting and making decisions about their fate without the participation of Arab countries.

    阿拉伯人民不同意由美英来决定他们的命运
    新华社1日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理加齐在1月31日对记者说，叙利亚同其他阿拉伯国家准备向目前正在华盛顿举行会谈的艾森豪威尔和艾登提出联合备忘录。这个备忘录将表明阿拉伯国家拒绝承认任何没有得到它们同意的关于巴勒斯坦问题的决定。
    据新华社讯　有名的埃及记者法鲁克·艾尔—加迪在埃及“生活”杂志上撰文指出，艾森豪威尔和艾登的华盛顿会谈将不会解决中东问题和建立中东的和平。他们聚会的目的是要使他们剥削各国人民的种种殖民计划取得协调。作者强调指出，“对中东和平的唯一威胁是殖民主义”。
    另一家埃及周刊“鲁兹·优素福”在社论中写道：“艾登和艾森豪威尔能够相会，讨论他们所想讨论的东西。但是他们不能把自己的意志强加于中东人民。中东人民相信和平和民主，他们希望执行中立政策，争取工业化，以便得到经济独立，不使自己的富源操在外国人手里。但是西方不愿意承认中东人民的这些起码要求。”
    黎巴嫩“电讯报”发表了这家报纸的所有人和总编辑麦特尼的一篇文章说，艾登和艾森豪威尔为了维持英美在中东的势力而举行的会谈，将是对独立的阿拉伯国家的事务和命运的干涉，没有一个阿拉伯人会同意由艾登和艾森豪威尔在没有阿拉伯国家参加的情况下就它们的命运进行会商和作出决定。
