    In January, six livestock production cooperatives were established in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province, in Xinghai County, Guinan County, Sujitan in the Xunhua Salar Autonomous County, and Dulan County. In these areas where livestock production cooperatives were established, the unity between and within ethnic groups is very solid, the social security situation is good, and ethnic regional autonomous governments have been established, and a large number of ethnic minority cadres have been trained. The foundation for mutual aid and cooperation in production among herdsmen is also relatively good.
    At present, all livestock production cooperatives are actively carrying out work to prevent freezing, protect production, and deliver and raise lambs; some cooperatives have already formulated their 1956 production plans. (Qinghai Daily Editorial Department)

    青海省试办牧业生产合作社
    青海省牧业区一月间在兴海县、贵南县、亹源回族自治县苏吉滩和都兰县成立了六个牧业生产合作社。这些成立牧业生产合作社的地区，民族间和民族内部的团结都很巩固，社会治安情况良好，并且都已经建立了民族区域自治政权，培养出大批民族干部。牧民之间在生产上的团结互助基础也比较好。
    目前，各牧业生产合作社正在积极进行防冻、保产和接羔育羔工作；有的社已经制定了1956年的生产计划。　（青海日报编辑部）
