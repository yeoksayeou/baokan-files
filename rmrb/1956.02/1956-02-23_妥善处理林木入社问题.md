Properly Handle the Issue of Villagers Joining the Collective with their Trees
Lin Mo

Recently, in some areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as agricultural production cooperatives transitioned from elementary to advanced cooperatives, the phenomenon of farmers indiscriminately cutting down trees has occurred. Such incidents have occurred in succession in Helinge'er, Liangcheng, and Wudong counties. Not only ordinary farmers were cutting down trees, but also Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and even village forest protection committee members and afforestation models. In Xiyingzi Village, Luojiaying Township, Seventh District of Wudong County, more than 300 trees, large and small, were cut down within a few days.

The main reason for the tree cutting phenomenon is the improper handling of the issue of farmers joining the collective with their privately owned trees. For example, the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Liangcheng County stipulated that all scattered or clustered trees outside one foot of the courtyard would be priced and transferred to the collective. At the same time, the price of the trees was set relatively low. Those who owned trees accepted this method under the pressure of public opinion among the cooperative members, but their thinking had not actually been cleared. They felt that they had worked hard for many years, watching the trees grow up, and it was not even convenient to use the wood. As a result, the tree cutting occurred. In other places, due to insufficient publicity regarding the correct policies and methods for handling privately owned trees of cooperative members, some farmers also started cutting down trees after hearing rumors of "trees becoming public property."

In the process of agricultural cooperation, Party and government leading organs at all levels must pay close attention to preventing farmers from indiscriminately cutting down trees. Proper handling methods must be adopted for farmers to join the collective with their privately owned trees, and the tree price must be stipulated reasonably and fairly. In those places where the handling of private trees of cooperative members has been improper and caused dissatisfaction among cooperative members, it should be quickly corrected based on the correct handling principles.

    妥善处理林木入社问题
    林沫
    近来内蒙古自治区有些地方的农业生产合作社在由初级社转为高级社的过程中，发生了农民乱砍树木的现象。在和林格尔、凉城、武东等县都接连发生了这样的事情。砍树的不仅有一般农民，还有共产党员、青年团员，甚至村的护林委员、造林模范也砍了树。武东县七区罗家营乡西营子村，在几天之内，就砍伐了大、小树300多棵。
    发生砍树现象的主要原因，是对农民私有林木入社问题处理不当。如凉城县金星农业合作社规定把房院一尺以外的各种零星或成片林木，全部作价归社，同时树价定得也比较低；有树的人，在社员群众舆论的压力下接受了这种办法，实际上思想还没有通。他们感到自己辛苦了多年，眼看树木长大，连使用个木材也不方便了。于是，砍树的事情就发生了。还有些地方，由于对正确处理社员私有林木的政策和办法宣传不够，有的农民听到“林木归公”的风谣，也跟着砍起树来。
    在农业合作化过程中，各地党、政领导机关必须十分注意防止农民乱砍树木。对农民私有树木入社必须采取妥善处理办法，树价必须规定得合理公道。在那些对社员私有林木处理不当、引起社员不满的地方，应该根据正确的处理原则迅速加以纠正。
