    May the Great Friendship Be Further Expanded and Consolidated
    By I. Tevosyan, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR
    Today, the people of China and the Soviet Union are celebrating the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
    This treaty is a great document of our time. It embodies a new type of international relations built on the principles of proletarian internationalism and truly fraternal, selfless cooperation. The aim of this cooperation is to most rapidly develop the national economy of each country, improve the welfare of the people, and safeguard and consolidate peace throughout the world.
    The people of all countries who have embarked on or are embarking on the road of national rejuvenation understand the essence of this new relationship, which is based on complete equality and mutual respect for national interests. This relationship is fundamentally different from the relationship between imperialist countries. Imperialist countries strive by all means to expand the profits of monopoly capital, weaken the economies of other countries, keep these countries in a subordinate position, and incite hostility and national disputes among the peoples in order to control and enslave them.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, as well as similar treaties concluded between countries advancing along the path of building socialism and communism, expand the scope of economic cooperation, enable these countries' economic development plans to be coordinated with each other, and realize the specialization and collaboration of production among them in order to make the best use of the natural resources, technical equipment, and full production potential of each country. This close cooperation has a good impact on the economic development of the countries, increases the material welfare of the people of each country, and accelerates the construction of socialism and communism.
    In the past six years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have won great victories in socialist construction and are confidently advancing towards the great goal of transforming their free motherland into a powerful socialist industrial country.
    In this short but revolutionary period, the state system of the People's Republic of China has been consolidated, the Chinese people have achieved unprecedented unity and are closely united around the Communist Party, and the socialist transformation of industry, agriculture, and commerce has been successfully realized, laying a solid foundation for the further strong development of the country.
    Guided by the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on heavy industry—the material and technical foundation of socialism—the Chinese Communist Party has led the Chinese people in the struggle for the socialist industrialization of the country and for the successful completion of the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy.
    Based on their own experience, the Soviet people know how difficult it is to begin industrializing a backward country. They know that this is linked to temporarily enduring some material deficiencies for the sake of a bright future. At the same time, they also know that if the laborers work not for the capitalists, but for themselves and for the interests of the people, then the strength and potential of the people are inexhaustible.
    After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we began to restore our national economy, which had been devastated by the years of war and armed intervention, in very difficult circumstances and under the blockade of capitalist countries. It is only necessary to point out that the production of steel, which ultimately determines the development of all sectors of the national economy, totaled only 194,000 tons in 1920, at the beginning of the recovery period, while the maximum production of steel in pre-revolutionary Russia (1913) was 4.3 million tons. The Soviet people reached this level of steel production in 1928, and by 1937, due to the completion of two five-year plans, Soviet steel production had reached 17.7 million tons. In 1955, 45.2 million tons of steel were produced.
    Other sectors of Soviet industry are also developing at a high speed. Coal mining increased from 35.5 million tons at the beginning of the first five-year plan to 391 million tons in 1955, oil production increased from 11.6 million tons to 70.8 million tons, and electricity production increased from 5 billion kilowatt-hours to 170 billion kilowatt-hours. During this same period, the total output of all industrial sectors increased twentyfold, while the output of means of production increased thirty-ninefold. The machine-building industry, the heart of all industry, increased ninety-threefold.
    Such a high speed of production development has never been seen in any capitalist country, even during its most prosperous period. It must also be noted that between 1941 and 1945, the Soviet people defended their freedom and independence with arms, crushed the enemy, and then restored the economy that had been destroyed by the war, only reaching the pre-war 1940 level of industrial production in 1948.
    The path traversed by the people of our country clearly shows how great a cause can be accomplished by the liberated masses of people who have shattered the shackles of slavery and embarked on the road of socialist construction.
    The rapid and priority development of industry, especially the industry that produces the means of production, is vividly reflected in China's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy. In the past three years, the hardworking Chinese people have demonstrated unprecedented examples of creative and selfless work in their national history, and have achieved significant results in the implementation of the five-year plan. It is only necessary to point out that, according to preliminary materials, with an annual increase rate of 17.5%, the total output of industrial products has increased by 62%. Steel production has nearly doubled, coal mining has increased by nearly 50%, oil has more than doubled, and electricity production has increased by more than 70%. At the same time, 271 of the 694 enterprises above the limit that were planned to start construction in the five-year plan have been put into production.
    The achievements and high enthusiasm already gained by the Chinese working people have made it practically possible to put forward the task of completing the first five-year plan ahead of schedule.
    The Soviet people are sincerely happy and sincerely congratulate the Chinese working class and all the people on the great achievements they have made in the cause of national industrialization.
    The Chinese laboring peasants gloriously worked for a year in 1955. 1955 saw the best harvest in Chinese history - 180 million tons of grain, 1.5 million tons of cotton. At present, the Chinese Communist Party is implementing a huge program of socialist collectivization of agriculture. Responding to the call of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the laboring peasants enthusiastically participate in agricultural production cooperatives. About 93 million households, or 78% of all peasant households, have embarked on this socialist road of agricultural development.
    The Soviet people pay great attention to the draft program for agricultural development of the People's Republic of China for 1956-1967 published in the press. This grand plan, which sets clear goals for millions of peasants, has aroused the admiration of all the Soviet people. We believe that the great task of improving agriculture and improving the material welfare of the peasant masses will be successfully realized under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party.
    The fact that the Chinese laboring peasants have chosen the only correct path to a happy and prosperous life is well understood by the Soviet people who have realized the socialist collectivization of agriculture. The Soviet people hope that the Chinese laboring peasants and all the people will achieve a complete victory in the large-scale socialist transformation of the countryside, and on this basis, make the agricultural productive forces unprecedentedly developed in the recent years, and further consolidate the unbreakable alliance between the working class and the peasants.
    The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce as well as handicrafts being carried out in the People's Republic of China has the most important political and economic significance. The Chinese Communist Party has creatively applied and developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism, thus creating the possibility of shortening the time of transforming private capitalist enterprises into joint state-private enterprises from the general line of the Party in the transitional period previously stipulated.
    Accelerating the socialist transformation of rural and urban areas creates more favorable conditions for national industrialization and laying a solid socialist foundation.
    The Chinese Communist Party tirelessly devotes itself to the ideological education of the people, carries out huge work to enable the broad masses to learn technology and culture, and carefully cultivates engineering and technical cadres and economic cadres. The Chinese people are smoothly cultivating the people's intellectuals who can assume heavy responsibilities in the construction of socialism, because without a large number of people's intellectuals, the task of improving the country's industry and culture can never be solved.
    We know from the experience of Soviet socialist construction that cultivating such intellectuals is not an easy task, requiring great efforts and considerable time. Despite the difficulties, the Soviet people have successfully completed this task under the leadership of their beloved Communist Party, and cultivated a large number of cadres of truly people's intellectuals. Now, there are more than 5.5 million experts with higher and secondary specialized education in our national economy. The Soviet people firmly believe that the great Chinese people will also overcome all the difficulties in this regard and successfully complete the task of cultivating a large number of people's intellectuals.
    The Soviet people also believe that the Chinese people will surely successfully complete the task of adopting modern world scientific and technological achievements in the national economy, and will surely realize the large-scale development of science and scientific research in order to reach the advanced world scientific level in the shortest possible time.
    The Soviet people, as the faithful friends and brothers of the Chinese people, believe that it is their duty to do their best to help the Chinese people in this undertaking. Chinese workers and experts who come to the Soviet Union to study receive the most cordial reception and assistance in mastering various production technologies and technical regulations. And our experts and workers who go to work in China regard going to China as a high honor and trust, and strive to better impart their knowledge and experience to Chinese comrades, while also accepting everything best from the ancient culture of the Chinese people. The largest modern industrial enterprises in China are being built with the technical cooperation of Soviet experts. The Soviet Union is participating in the construction and reconstruction of a total of 156 enterprises.
    The equal economic relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are expanding year by year for the benefit of the people of our two countries. The foreign trade of our two countries is developing smoothly. From 1950 to 1955, the volume of mutual foreign trade expanded 4.3 times. The Soviet Union accounts for 50% of the People's Republic of China's foreign trade.
    The completion and opening to traffic of the Moscow-Ulan Bator-Beijing railway and the construction of the Almaty-Urumqi-Lanzhou railway line are of great significance for expanding the economic ties between our two countries.
    All aspects of cultural ties between our two peoples are also being consolidated and expanded day by day.
    The sixth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance coincides with the opening day of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a significant event in the lives of the Soviet Communist Party and all the Soviet people. This congress will summarize the brilliant victories our country has achieved in the cause of communist construction, and will determine the path for the Soviet Union to further advance towards communism.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is welcoming its 20th Congress with great achievements. The fifth five-year plan has been completed ahead of schedule. The total industrial output increased by 85% in five years, of which the production of means of production increased by 91%, and the total output of the machine-building and metal processing industries increased by 1.2 times. The task of reclaiming wasteland put forward by the Communist Party and the Soviet government has been basically completed. In 1955, the total grain harvest in the Soviet Union greatly exceeded that of 1954, while the harvest of corn expanded 2.6 times in one year. In 5 years, the production of daily necessities expanded by 76%, that is, more than doubled compared with the pre-war 1940 level.
    The successful implementation of the fifth five-year plan guarantees the further increase of our country's economic power and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. All the necessary conditions have been established to solve a basic economic task in a historically short period of time on the road of peaceful economic competition - to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output.
    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will discuss and adopt instructions on the sixth five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union from 1956 to 1960. It is stipulated that the total industrial output will increase by 65% in 5 years, and the grain harvest will reach an annual output of 11 billion poods. This illustrates the inexhaustible potential of the socialist economic system more vividly than any language.
    The completion of the sixth five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union will be a great contribution to the cause of further consolidating the entire socialist camp.
    The draft instructions on the sixth five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union have won a wide and friendly response in the People's Republic of China, and the people of fraternal China have warmly welcomed this draft. This is especially precious to us Soviet people.
    We are pleased to understand that the achievements of the Soviet people's constructive labor inspire the Chinese laboring people to move towards new victories, just as the achievements of the Chinese people inspire the Soviet people.
    The people of our two countries need peace to realize huge construction plans. Therefore, the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China are consistent in their desire to do everything possible to maintain peace and ease international tensions.
    Following this noble goal, the governments of our two countries have been persistently pursuing a policy of peace. The whole world knows the role played by the People's Republic of China as an active fighter for peace and friendship among the people of all countries. The People's Republic of China is one of the active participants in the Bandung Asian-African Conference. The Soviet Union welcomes the resolutions of this conference, which are aimed at maintaining peace, developing international cooperation, and opposing colonialism. Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, proposed that countries in the Asian and Pacific region, including the United States, conclude a collective peace treaty, and efforts to liberate Taiwan by peaceful means are examples of the peace-loving policy of the government of the People's Republic of China.
    The People's Republic of China seeks to ease international tensions, has begun negotiations with the United States, and unswervingly strives for the success of the negotiations to eliminate the tensions in the Taiwan region of China caused by the actions of the US government. This peaceful policy was newly and powerfully confirmed in Comrade Zhou Enlai's report at the January meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
    The international prestige of the People's Republic of China is growing day by day. Therefore, it is completely intolerable that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations have not yet been restored. The Soviet government has always advocated the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and has advocated the settlement of the Taiwan issue on the basis of recognizing the indisputable right of the People's Republic of China to this island.
    The people of all countries are satisfied to note the easing of international tensions, which has been achieved as a result of the Soviet government's adoption of such important measures: concluding a peace treaty with Austria, normalizing Soviet-Yugoslav relations, the Soviet Union abandoning the military base on Finland's Porkkala Peninsula, reducing its armed forces by 640,000 people, suggestions regarding the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, establishing diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, and participating in the Geneva Conference of the heads of government of the four countries. It is also necessary to point out the visits of Indian Republic Prime Minister Nehru and Burmese Federal Prime Minister U Nu to the Soviet Union. The visits of Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev to India, Burma and Afghanistan, as well as the letter from Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to US President Eisenhower on the conclusion of a Soviet-American treaty of friendship and cooperation, are a clear manifestation of the Soviet peaceful diplomatic policy.
    All these and other concrete measures taken by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China aimed at further easing international tensions and consolidating peace proceed from the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence of all countries (regardless of their socio-political systems). We firmly believe that despite the opposition of some Western countries that attempt to maintain international tensions, continue the arms race policy, and cobble together aggressive blocs, our efforts in this regard will surely end in victory.
    The great friendship of the people of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries is a guarantee of the victory of our just cause. This friendship is an indestructible force in the struggle for peace and freedom, happiness and joy. The number of fighters for these great ideas is growing day by day. We are witnessing a new and powerful upsurge in the national liberation movement of the colonial and dependent countries, which has been widely launched under the influence of the victory of the Chinese revolution.
    On the sixth anniversary of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet people would like to pay warm respects to their friends and brothers—the great Chinese people—and wish the Chinese people new victories and creative success in solving the historical task of turning China into an industrialized power and building a socialist society.
    May the unbreakable friendship and powerful alliance of the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—a reliable pillar of world peace—be increasingly expanded and consolidated.

    祝伟大的友谊更加扩大和巩固
    苏联部长会议副主席  伊·捷沃西安
    中苏两国人民今天都在庆祝苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国友好同盟互助条约缔结六周年。
    这个条约是我们时代的伟大文献，它体现了建立在无产阶级国际主义原则和真正兄弟般无私的合作的基础上的新型国际关系，这种合作的目的就是要最迅速地发展每个国家的国民经济，增进人民的福利，维护并巩固全世界的和平。
    所有已经走上和正在走上民族复兴道路的国家的人民都懂得这种以完全平等和相互尊重民族利益的基础的新关系的实质。这种关系是同帝国主义国家之间的关系根本不同的。帝国主义国家竭力以各种手段扩大垄断资本的利润，削弱其他国家的经济，使这些国家一直处于从属地位并在各国人民中引起敌对和民族纠纷以便控制和奴役他们。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约以及沿着建设社会主义和共产主义道路前进的各国间缔结的类似的条约，扩大着经济合作的范围，使这些国家的经济发展计划能够互相配合，并在它们中间实现生产的专业化和协作以便最好地利用每个国家所拥有的天然富源、技术设备和全部生产潜力。这种密切合作良好地影响着各国经济的发展，增进各国人民的物质福利，并加速社会主义和共产主义的建设。
    过去六年中，中国人民在中国共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会领导下，在社会主义建设方面赢得了巨大的胜利，并正在满怀信心地向把自己自由的祖国变成强大的社会主义工业国的伟大目标前进。
    在这个不长的、但却富有革命内容的时期，中华人民共和国的国家制度巩固了，中国人民达到了空前的统一，并紧密地团结在共产党的周围，顺利实现了工业、农业、商业的社会主义改造，为国家进一步强有力的发展打下了稳固的基础。
    以马克思列宁主义关于重工业——社会主义的物质技术基础——的学说为指南，中国共产党领导了中国人民争取国家社会主义工业化、争取顺利完成发展国民经济第一个五年计划的斗争。
    苏联人民根据自己的经验懂得，开始使一个落后的国家工业化是多么困难，他们知道这是同为了光明的未来而暂时忍受某种物质的缺乏相联系着的，同时他们也知道，如果劳动者不是为资本家，而是为自己、为人民的利益工作，那末人民的力量和潜力是取之不竭的。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命胜利以后，我们在非常艰苦的环境中，而且还是在资本主义国家的封锁下，开始恢复战争和武装干涉年代遭受破坏的本国经济。只须指出，最后决定国民经济所有部门的发展的钢的生产量，在开始恢复时期的1920年总共只有194，000吨，而革命前俄国（1913年）钢的最大生产量是430万吨。苏联人民在1928年使钢的生产量达到了这个水平，而到1937年，由于两个五年计划的完成，苏联钢的生产已经达到1，770万吨，1955年生产了4，520万吨钢。
    苏联工业的其他部门也在以高速度发展着。煤的采掘量从第一个五年计划初期的3，550万吨增加到1955年的39，100万吨，石油的采掘量从1，160万吨增加到7，080万吨，电力生产由50亿度增加到1，700亿度。在这同一时期所有工业部门的总产品量增加到二十倍，而生产资料的生产量增加到三十九倍。作为一切工业的心脏的机器制造业增加到九十三倍。
    这样发展生产的高速度是任何一个资本主义国家，甚至在它最顺利的发展时期都不曾有过的。同时还必须注意到，在1941年到1945年间，苏联人民曾手执武器捍卫自己的自由和独立，粉碎了敌人，以后又恢复了为战争所破坏的经济，只是到1948年才达到了战前1940年的工业生产水平。
    我国各族人民所经历的道路明显地表明，粉碎了奴役的枷锁并走上社会主义建设道路的解放了的人民群众能够完成多么伟大的事业。
    工业，首先是生产生产资料的工业的迅速优先发展，在中国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中得到鲜明的反映。在过去三年中，勤劳的中国人民表现了在本国历史上前所未有的创造性的忘我工作的范例，并在执行五年计划中取得了重大的成绩。只须指出，根据初步材料，在每年递增17.5％的速度下，工业品总产量已增加了62％。钢的产量增加了近一倍，煤的采掘量增加近50％，石油增加了一倍多，电力生产增加了70％多。同时，五年计划中规定开工的694个限额以上的企业，已经有271个投入生产。
    中国劳动人民已获得的成绩和高度的热情，使提前完成第一个五年计划的任务的提出在实际上成为可能。
    苏联人民衷心地感到欢乐，并真诚地祝贺中国工人阶级和全体人民在国家工业化事业中获得的巨大成就。
    中国的劳动农民在1955年光荣地工作了一年。1955年获得了中国历史上从未有过的丰收——18，000万吨谷物、150万吨棉花。目前，中国共产党在实现着巨大的农业的社会主义合作化的纲领。劳动农民响应中国共产党和毛泽东同志的号召，热情地参加农业生产合作社。约有9，300万户，即全体农户的78％走上了这个发展农业的社会主义道路。
    苏联人非常注意公布在报刊上的1956—1967年中华人民共和国农业发展纲要草案。这个为千百万农民提出了明确目标的宏伟计划，引起了全体苏联人民的赞美。我们相信，提高农业和改善农民群众物质福利的巨大任务，在光荣的中国共产党的领导下将会成功地实现。
    中国劳动农民选择了走向幸福和富裕生活的唯一正确的道路这件事，对于实现了农业社会主义集体化的苏联人民来说是很了解的。苏联人民希望中国劳动农民和全体人民在实现大规模的农村社会主义改造方面获得全胜，并在这个基础上在最近几年内使农业生产力空前发展，使工人阶级和农民牢不可破的联盟进一步巩固。
    中华人民共和国正进行的资本主义工商业以及手工业的社会主义改造是具有最重要的政治和经济的意义的。中国共产党创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义的理论，因而创造了缩短从前党在过渡时期的总路线中所规定的把私人资本主义企业改造为公私合营企业的时间的可能性。
    加速农村和城市的社会主义改造，为国家工业化和奠定牢固的社会主义基础创造了更多的有利条件。
    中国共产党不倦地致力于人民的思想教育工作，进行着使广大群众学习技术文化的巨大工作，关怀地培养工程技术干部和经济干部。中国人民正在顺利地培养着在建设社会主义事业中能担当重任的人民知识分子，因为没有大量的人民知识分子，就绝不能解决提高国家的工业和文化的任务。
    我们从苏联社会主义建设的经验可以知道，培养这样的知识分子不是一件容易的任务，需要巨大的努力和相当的时间。尽管是有困难的，但苏联人民在自己亲爱的共产党领导下成功地完成了这项任务，并培养出为数众多的真正的人民知识分子的干部。现在，在我国国民经济中有550多万受过高等和中等专门教育的专家。苏联人坚信伟大的中国人民也会克服这方面的一切困难，成功地完成培养大量人民的知识分子干部的任务。
    苏联人民也相信，中国人民一定会成功地完成在国民经济中采用现代世界科学和技术成就的任务，一定会实现为了在尽可能短的时期内达到先进的世界科学水平而展开大规模发展科学和科学研究的工作。
    苏联人民作为中国人民的忠实朋友和兄弟，认为在这项事业中尽力帮助中国人民是自己的责任。来到苏联学习的中国工人和专家们，在掌握各种生产的技术设备和技术规程方面受到最亲切的接待和帮助。而我们那些去到中国工作的专家和工人，都把前往中国看做是高度的荣誉和信任，努力更好地把他们所拥有的知识和经验传授给中国同志，同时他们也从中国人民古老的文化中接受了一切最优秀的东西。在苏联专家的技术合作下建筑着中国最大的现代化工业企业。苏联参加建筑和改建的共有156项企业。
      苏联和中华人民共和国之间平等的经济关系为了我们两国人民的利益在一年年扩大着。我们两国的对外贸易顺利地发展着。从1950年到1955年的时期内，相互间的对外贸易额扩大了四点三倍。在中华人民共和国的对外贸易额中，苏联占50％。
    莫斯科—乌兰巴托—北京铁路的完工和通车以及阿拉木图—乌鲁木齐—兰州铁路线的建设，对于扩大我们两国的经济联系都有重要的意义。
    我们两国人民之间的各方面的文化联系也在日益巩固和扩大。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的六周年纪念日，正好是苏联共产党和全体苏联人民生活中意义重大的事件——苏共第二十次代表大会开幕日。这次代表大会将要总结我国在共产主义建设事业中所获得的光辉胜利，并决定苏联向共产主义进一步前进的道路。
    苏联共产党是以巨大的成就来迎接自己的第二十次代表大会的。第五个五年计划提前完成了。工业总产量在5年中增加了85％，其中生产资料的生产增加了91％，而机器制造业和金属加工业的总产量增加了1.2倍。共产党和苏联政府提出的开垦荒地的任务基本上完成了。1955年苏联谷物总收获量大大超过1954年，同时玉蜀黍的收获量一年之中就扩大了2.6倍。5年来，日用品的生产扩大了76％，即比战前1940年水平增加了一倍以上。
    第五个五年计划的顺利实现，保证我国经济威力的进一步高涨和苏联人民物质和文化生活水平的提高。已建立了一切必要条件，以使在和平的经济竞赛道路上在历史上极短的时期内解决一项基本的经济任务——在按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会将讨论并通过关于1956—1960年苏联发展国民经济第六个五年计划的指示。5年内规定工业总产量增加65％，谷物收获量达到年产110亿普特。这比任何语言都更鲜明地说明社会主义经济制度中取之不尽的潜在力。
    完成苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划，将是对进一步巩固整个社会主义阵营事业的伟大贡献。
    苏联发展国民经济第六个五年计划的指示草案在中华人民共和国博得了广泛的友好的反应，兄弟中国的人民非常热情地欢迎这个草案。这是我们苏联人感到特别珍贵的。
    我们高兴地理解到：苏联人民建设性劳动的成就鼓舞着中国劳动人民走向新的胜利，正如中国人民的成就鼓舞着苏联人一样。
    我们两国人民需要和平以实现巨大的建设计划。因此苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府在尽一切力量来维护和平和缓和国际紧张局势的愿望上是一致的。
    我们两国政府遵循着这个高尚的目标，坚持不懈地推行和平政策。全世界都知道中华人民共和国作为一个争取和平和各国人民友好的积极战士所起的作用。中华人民共和国是万隆亚非会议的积极参加者之一。苏联欢迎这个会议的旨在维护和平、发展国际合作、反对殖民主义的决议。中华人民共和国国务院总理和外交部长周恩来同志关于亚洲和太平洋地区国家，包括美国在内，缔结一个集体和平公约的建议以及争取以和平的方式解放台湾的努力，都是中华人民共和国政府爱好和平的政策的实例。
    中华人民共和国力求缓和国际紧张局势，同美国开始了谈判，并始终不渝地争取谈判成功，以消除由美国政府的行动所造成的中国台湾地区的紧张局势。这一和平政策，周恩来同志在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会一月会议的报告中得到新的有力的确认。
    中华人民共和国的国际威信在一天天地增长。因此，到现在还不恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利，是完全不能容忍的。苏联政府一贯主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，并且主张在承认中华人民共和国对这个岛的不可争辩的权力的基础上解决台湾问题。
      各国人民满意地注意到国际紧张局势的缓和，这种缓和是由于苏联政府采取这样一些重要措施的结果所达到的：同奥地利缔结和约，苏南关系的正常化，苏联放弃芬兰波卡拉半岛的军事基地，裁减自己的武装部队64万人，关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的建议，同德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系，参加四国政府首脑日内瓦会议。还必须指出印度共和国总理尼赫鲁和缅甸联邦总理吴努的访问苏联。布尔加宁同志和赫鲁晓夫同志的访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗以及苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁关于缔结苏美友好合作条约给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信件是苏联和平外交政策的显明表现。
    苏联和中华人民共和国所有这些和其他一些旨在进一步和缓国际紧张局势和巩固和平的具体措施，都是从各国（不问其社会政治制度如何）和平共处的列宁原则出发的。我们坚决地相信，尽管企图保持国际紧张局势、继续军备竞赛政策和拼凑侵略集团的某些西方国家的反对，我们在这方面的努力一定会以胜利告终的。
    中华人民共和国、苏联和人民民主国家人民的伟大友谊是我们正义事业的胜利保证，这种友谊是争取和平和自由、幸福和愉快生活的斗争中不可摧毁的力量。为这些伟大思想而斗争的战士的数目在一天天地增长。我们是在中国革命胜利的影响下广泛开展起来的殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放运动新的强大高涨的见证人。
    在友好同盟互助条约六周年纪念日，苏联人民谨向自己的朋友和兄弟——伟大的中国人民——致以热烈的敬礼，并祝中国人民在解决把中国变为一个工业化的强国和建成社会主义社会的历史任务中获得新的胜利和创造性的成功。
    祝苏联和中华人民共和国人民的牢不可破的友谊和强大的同盟——世界和平的可靠支柱日益扩大和巩固。
