	Learn from Advanced Producers
	Rationalization Proposals Come in a Torrent

	From early December of last year to the end of January this year, the workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant submitted a total of 426 rationalization proposals. Among them, 355 were submitted in January, and 80% of these 355 could be adopted, saving an estimated 10,000 work hours.

	At the peak of mass enthusiasm, the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory received an average of one rationalization proposal every 5 minutes. The workers of the Shenyang Battery Factory submitted very few rationalization proposals last year, but after hearing the central government's instructions, one workshop alone submitted 100 proposals. Since the beginning of this year, the workers of the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory have submitted a total of 393 proposals, with increasing enthusiasm. The Qiqihar Locomotive Factory has submitted a total of 1,477 rationalization proposals, of which 985 have been approved, and 309 have been implemented immediately.

	"One and a Half Quota" Movement

	In January, the standard parts processing workshop of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant had an average of 93 production workers. Among them, 47 people could complete more than 12 hours of work per day, 24 people could complete 8-12 hours of work per day, and 22 people could only complete less than 8 hours of work per day. On average, each of the 93 people completed more than 12 hours of work. The batch workshop had an average of 133 production workers, each of whom could complete an average of 11.22 hours of work per day.

	Now, 155 people in the factory, including lathe operator Han Fulin and riveter Zhang Yumin, have proposed to all workers in the factory to carry out the "one and a half quota movement" (i.e., doing 12 hours of work in 8 hours).

	Backward Workers Exceed Quotas

	Meng Fanshan, a young worker at the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory, was usually ideologically backward and worked carelessly, only drilling 50 switch housings in 8 hours. After hearing the central government's instructions, his thinking changed, and he improved the tools using an old machine tool, and now he can make 35 pieces per hour.

	Tao Rihui, a lathe operator at the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, was very backward in the past, dozing off on the night shift and leaving work before the end of the shift. Now his awareness has been raised, and the work he used to do in 9 minutes, he can now do in 1 minute.

	A team in the cold casting wheel workshop of the Qiqihar Locomotive Factory had not completed its task for 10 months; after hearing the report, it completed the task in January and exceeded the plan by six tons.

	Exceeding Old Quotas by More Than Ten Times

	Many workers in enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building have broken old quotas one after another.

	He Jinsheng, a young fitter at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, improved tools and can complete 95 hours of work in 8 hours, exceeding the old quota by more than 1,189%. Lathe operator Li Jinlong can complete 82.5 hours of quota in one day, exceeding the old quota by more than 1,003%.

	The Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant originally planned 2,000 work hours per unit to manufacture a 1 cubic meter electric shovel, but now it only takes 1,421 work hours, increasing efficiency by 30%. The 0.5 cubic meter electric shovel originally planned 1,620 work hours per unit, but now it only takes 1,150 work hours. The boring machine used by Fang Baowu's team in the metalworking workshop is a key equipment in the factory. The workers in this team improved the tools and proposed to complete 20 months of work in one year. Feng Shizong's team in the metalworking workshop originally undertook 6,000 machine hours of tasks, but now they can undertake another 5,000 machine hours of tasks, an increase of nearly doubled. The sand injection pipe team originally planned to complete 2,400 tons of tasks by the end of 1956. After the masses heard the central government's instructions, they decided to complete it 3 months ahead of schedule.

	The mechanical workshop of the Qiqihar Locomotive Factory used to process 32 locomotive side frames per day, but now it processes 56, an increase of 75%. The processing of locomotive smoke box joints originally had a quota of 120 minutes, but now it has been reduced to 30 minutes, increasing efficiency by 300%. In this factory, almost every team has to break several quotas.

	The unit horsepower consumption of metalworking man-hours in the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory was a little more than 11 hours in December last year. Now, after mass discussion, it has been compressed to 5 hours; the foundry workshop originally needed 120 hours to make castings for a 40-horsepower diesel engine, but now it has been compressed to 25 hours, increasing by 480%.

	Learning from Advanced Experience, Improving Quality

	The scrap rate of plowshare quenching in the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory was as high as 15%-20% in December last year. Later, they learned from the experience of the Lingshan Agricultural Machinery Factory, and recently it has dropped to 0.5%-0.6%. The plow mirror Shi Junfang team learned from the advanced experience of the Kaifeng Factory, and the scrap rate dropped to below 2%.

专栏：向先进生产者看齐

    向先进生产者看齐
    合理化建议纷纷来
    上海机床厂的职工们，从去年12月上旬到今年1月底，一共提出合理化建议426件。其中在1月份提出的有355件，这355件里有80％可以采纳，经计算可以节约1万个工时。
    上海电机厂在群众情绪达到最高潮的时候，平均每5分钟接到一份合理化建议。沈阳电池厂职工去年提的合理化建议很少，今年听了传达中央指示以后，一个车间就提了100条。沈阳低压开关厂职工今年以来一共提了393条建议，劲头越来越大。齐齐哈尔机车厂共提出合理化建议1，477件，已经批准985件，立即实现了的有309件。
    “个半定额”运动
    太原矿山机器厂标准件加工车间1月份平均有93个生产工人，其中每天能完成12小时以上工作量的有47人，每天能完成8—12小时工作量的有24人，每天只能完成8小时以下工作量的有22人。平均93人每人都完成12小时以上的工作量。成批车间平均有133个生产工人，每人每天平均也能完成11.22小时的工作量。
    现在，这个厂里已经有车工韩福林、铆工张玉民等155人，向全厂职工提出开展“个半定额运动”（即8小时工作时间内作12小时的活）。
    落后工人突破定额
    沈阳低压开关厂青工孟范山，平时思想落后，工作吊儿郎当，做一种开关的外壳钻孔，8小时只做50件。听过传达中央指示以后，他的思想转变了，利用旧床子改进工具，现在每小时可做到35件。
    沈阳高压开关厂车工陶日灰过去很落后，上夜班打瞌睡，下班时间没到就下班。现在他的觉悟提高了，过去9分钟干的活，现在1分钟就干完了。
    齐齐哈尔机车厂冷铸车轮车间有一个小组，已经有10个月没有完成任务；听了传达报告后，一月份完成了任务，并超过计划六吨。
    超过旧定额十倍以上
    第一机械工业部所属企业中的许多工人，纷纷打破旧定额。
    太原矿山机器厂青年钳工贺金生改进工具，8小时能完成95小时的工作量，超过旧定额1，189％以上。车工李金龙一天能完成82.5小时的定额，超过旧定额1，003％以上。
    抚顺重型机器厂制造1立方公尺电铲，原计划2，000工时一台，现在只用1，421工时，提高效率30％。0.5立方公尺电铲原计划1，620工时一台，现在只用1，150工时。金工车间方宝武小组使用的搪床是全厂的关键设备，这个小组的工人们改进了工具，提出要以一年的时间完成20个月的工作量。金工车间冯世宗小组原来承担6，000台时的任务，现在可以再承担5，000台时的任务，增加了将近一倍。注砂管小组原订到1956年末完成2，400吨的任务。群众听过中央指示的传达以后，决定要提前3个月完成。
    齐齐哈尔机车厂机械车间加工机车侧架，过去每天32个，现在56个，提高了75％。加工机车烟箱接头，原定额120分钟，现在压低到30分钟，提高效率300％。在这个工厂里，差不多每小组都要突破几项定额。
    无锡柴油机厂的单位马力消耗金工工时，去年12月份是11个小时多一些，现在经过群众讨论，压缩到5小时；铸工车间原来做一台40匹马力的柴油机的铸件，需要120小时，现已压缩到25小时，提高了480％。
    学习先进经验，提高质量
    北京农业机械厂犁铧淬火的废品率，去年12月高达15％—20％。后来他们学习了灵山农业机械厂的经验，最近已经降至0.5％—0.6％。犁镜史俊方小组学习开封厂的先进经验，废品率降到了2％以下。
