Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

I listened to Chairman Zhou's political report and the reports of the Vice-Chairmen, and I express my strong support. In Chairman Zhou's report, detailed analyses and explanations were given regarding the international situation and the domestic conditions. In order to adapt to the new situation of the current high tide of the socialist revolution, to promote the progress and development of various construction undertakings, and to call on us to fully mobilize and give play to the strength of intellectuals, he instructed us to "focus on discussing the issue of intellectuals" in this meeting. Following this, we heard Vice-Chairman Guo's report on "The Mission of Intellectuals in the High Tide of the Socialist Revolution." I believe the raising of this issue is very correct, very necessary, and timely.

For several years, the Party and the government have adopted the policy of unity, education, and transformation towards us intellectuals. This policy is wise and correct, and the results of its implementation have achieved great successes. I am engaged in secondary education work. Taking Beijing's secondary education as an example, it has seen great development and progress since liberation. The number of middle school students was over 40,000 in 1949, and it has increased to over 117,000 by 1955. Student performance has also improved significantly. Especially after the Beijing Municipal Party Committee issued the decision to improve the quality of education in June 1954, teachers, after studying, had a clear direction in delving into teaching materials and improving teaching methods, which further significantly improved the quality of education. In 1954, the number of Beijing middle school students who passed the university entrance exam only accounted for 14%, but by 1955, it reached 67%. The vast majority of teachers love their profession, are down-to-earth, and have a clear understanding of the relationship between the cause of education and the future of the nation. They feel that they are glorious and have a future, and therefore have a strong desire to transform and improve themselves.

In the past six months, the new situation of the high tide of the socialist revolution, and the infinitely beautiful and bright prospects of a socialist society, the practice of this objective reality and the experience of social life, have greatly inspired the enthusiasm of teachers and staff, and many activists have emerged. They are all more eager to transform themselves and improve themselves, and are willing to systematically study Marxism-Leninism and professional knowledge, so that they can better accomplish the tasks entrusted to them by the motherland. Young teachers are certainly full of energy, and veteran teachers are also not willing to fall behind, and are also running forward. I have been teaching in middle schools for more than 30 years, and I have never seen this phenomenon before, nor have I ever had such feelings, because this new situation is also urging me, encouraging me, and making me enthusiastically demand to improve myself and transform myself. At an annual award ceremony, a 60-year-old teacher requested to join the Party and participate in rural literacy work during the winter vacation; a Christian teacher said that he would not only improve his professional skills but also transform himself to possess the qualities of a Party member; a teacher with a more complicated history said that he would complete a university major within 5 years and strictly demand himself according to the conditions of a Party member in order to devote himself to the cause of socialist construction. All these facts can show that our intellectuals have also undergone fundamental changes in recent times. We must not underestimate the progressive demands of intellectuals. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "criticize right-leaning conservative thinking," "be proactive, not passive; strengthen leadership, not abandon leadership," and help them carry out thorough self-transformation, and help them systematically improve their knowledge, so that they can contribute more strength and play a greater role in the great cause of socialist construction. This is the current urgent task.

Regarding how to help middle school teachers carry out transformation and improvement, I would like to offer the following suggestions based on what I know for reference:

	1. Systematically organize middle school teachers' professional and theoretical studies. Secondary education is responsible for ensuring the delivery of fully qualified outstanding students to universities and qualified outstanding cadres to construction departments. Whether the quality of students is up to par is inseparable from the quality of the teachers themselves. In addition, in order to change the backward state of our country's culture, science, and technology, and catch up with the advanced level of developed countries in the shortest possible time, the further training and advanced studies of the current large number of middle school teachers should also be regarded as an important link, which must be grasped tightly and not be let go of. How to enable junior high school teachers to reach a professional level and high school teachers to reach a university undergraduate level within a few years, the arrangements for time, professional courses, and theoretical courses must be comprehensively planned with a plan and steps. On this point, we have not done enough in the past. Although there has been a lot of learning, most of it is sporadic and scattered, not a "comprehensive plan."

	2. Correct the egalitarian tendency in the wages of middle school teachers. At present, there is a tendency of egalitarianism in the wages of teachers and staff in middle schools. The difference in wages between junior high school teachers and high school teachers, teachers with high school diplomas and teachers with university degrees, is negligible. Many teachers with good professional skills and good work performance do not receive appropriate adjustments and improvements. If two teachers with similar professional skills, if one is transferred to a university, his salary will be immediately increased a lot. This cannot be said to have no impact on teachers' delving into teaching and settling down to work. Appropriate adjustments and improvements should be made under possible and reasonable conditions based on the development of production. There are still quite a few teachers who have large families and heavy burdens, and suffer from food and clothing shortages, and they should also be given appropriate care. In addition, most agencies and departments have staff dormitories, while middle schools do not have such facilities. Individuals rent houses with all kinds of difficulties, and the rent is very high. Some teachers live more than ten miles away from the school, traveling back and forth day and night, which not only wastes a lot of valuable time, but also affects the quality of work and physical health. Especially for female teachers, the situation is even more serious because the problem of nurseries has not been resolved. If the above problems can be properly resolved, it will surely relieve many concerns of teachers and staff and will certainly achieve corresponding results in improving the quality of education.

	3. Overcome the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic. Regarding the problem of the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic in middle schools, much has been overcome through the repeated attention and improvement of the higher-level leaders. However, in general, there are still a certain degree of meetings, studies, and social activities, and the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic still exists to a certain extent. Especially various tasks are easily concentrated on a few activists, and the more active they are, the busier they appear to be. This point is because the recent widespread demand for progress among teachers and staff has resulted in a large number of new activists, who can consider the situation and make appropriate improvements and adjustments. It is also hoped that the higher-level leaders will make a comprehensive plan for the arrangement of theoretical studies, professional studies, and various work conferences, and try their best to overcome the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic, so that teachers' energy can be concentrated on improving work and professional studies, as well as theoretical studies.

The Party and the government's care for intellectuals is meticulous. Regarding the issue of the transformation of intellectuals, the training, use, and treatment of intellectuals, the Party and the government will surely have a comprehensive plan, take various measures, and solve them separately. In addition, the most important thing is to rely on the efforts of the intellectuals themselves. Our socialist revolution has been widely and deeply unfolded throughout the country. I believe that all our intellectuals will be able to cooperate with this new situation, work hard to transform themselves, improve themselves, give play to their potential abilities and work enthusiasm, unite more closely around the Party, devote themselves to the construction of the motherland, so that the socialist revolution can be completed in the country as soon as possible, and make our motherland appear in the world as a prosperous and strong, highly cultured, and socialist industrial power.

    徐楚波的发言
    主席、诸位委员：
    我们听了周主席给我们做的政治报告和各位副主席的报告，我表示非常拥护。在周主席报告里对国际形势，国内状况都给了详细的分析和说明，为了适应目前社会主义革命高潮的新形势，为了推动各种建设事业的前进与发展，并且号召我们要充分动员和发挥知识分子的力量，指示我们在这次会议中，要“着重地讨论关于知识分子问题”。接着又听到了郭副主席的“在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命”的报告。我觉得这一问题的提出是十分正确，十分必要，而且是及时的。
    几年以来，党和政府对我们知识分子采取了团结、教育、改造的方针，这种政策是英明而正确的，执行的结果，也取得了巨大的成就。我是从事中等教育工作的，就拿北京市的中等教育来说，解放以来，就有很大的发展和进步。中学生人数1949年为4万多，到1955年已增到117，000多。学生成绩也有显著的提高。特别是1954年6月北京市委发布了提高教育质量的决定以后，教师们经过学习，在钻研教材和改善教学方法上都有了明确的方向，使教育质量更获得了显著的提高。1954年北京市中学生升大学的及格人数只占14％，至1955年便达到了67％。绝大多数的教师对自己的职业是热爱的，是踏踏实实的，对教育事业和国家民族前途的关系，是有清楚的认识和了解的，觉得自己是光荣的，有前途的，因而对改造自己和提高自己的要求，也是很热望的，很迫切的。
    半年以来，社会主义革命高潮的新形势，社会主义社会无限美丽光明的远景，这种客观现实的实践和社会生活的体验，更大大地鼓舞了教职员的积极性，涌现了许多的积极分子。他们都更迫切地要求改造自己，提高自己，都愿意有系统地学习马克思列宁主义和专业知识，好把祖国交付给自己的任务能够更好地完成。青年教师固然劲头十足，老教师们也绝不甘落后，也都跑步向前。我过去在中学教了30多年的书，从来没有看见过这种现象，也从来没有发生过这样的感想，因为这种新的形势也在督促着我，鼓舞着我，使我热烈地要求提高自己和改造自己呢。在年终的一次发奖大会上，一位60多岁的老教师提出要求入党，要求在寒假期间参加农村扫盲的工作；一个信奉基督教的教师，说自己不但要提高业务，而且要改造自己，具备一个党员的品质；一个历史比较复杂的教师，说5年内要学完大学专业课程，并且要严格地以党员条件要求自己，好献身于社会主义建设事业。这一切事实都可以说明，我们的知识分子在近来也已经起了根本的变化。我们对知识分子的进步要求，不能估计过低。我们必须遵照毛主席的指示：“批判右倾保守思想”，“要主动，不要被动；要加强领导，不要放弃领导。”很好地帮助他们进行彻底的自我改造，很好地帮助他们系统地提高知识，使他们在伟大的社会主义的建设事业中，贡献更大的力量，发挥更大的作用。这正是当前的急务。
    关于如何帮助中等学校教师来进行改造和提高的问题，我愿意就我所知，提出以下几点意见，供备参考：
    ⒈系统地组织中等学校教师的业务学习和理论学习。中等教育是负责保证给大学输送完全合格的优秀学生，给建设部门输送合格的优秀干部，而学生质量的是否合格，和教师本身的质量是分不开的。此外，要想改变我国文化、科学、技术的落后状态，在最短期间赶上先进国家的水平，则对目前大量中等学校教师的进一步的培养与进修，也应视为重要的一环，必须抓紧，不容放过。如何使初中教师在几年以内达到专业水平、高中教师达到大学本科水平，对时间安排，业务课程和理论课程的安排，都必须有计划有步骤地作全面的规划。而在这一点上，我们过去做的是不够的。虽然也有不少的学习，但大多是零星散乱，并非“全面规划”的。
    2、纠正中等学校工资中的平均主义倾向。目前中等学校教职员的工资存在着平均主义的倾向。初中的教师和高中的教师，高中毕业的教师和大学毕业的教师，在工资待遇上相差无几。很多业务好，工作成绩好的教师，得不到适当的调整与提高，两个业务差不多的教师，若有一个被调到大学，他的工资便马上被提高了很多。这对教师的钻研教学，安心供职，也不能说没有影响。应当根据生产发展的情况，在可能与合理的条件下，予以适当的调整和提高。教师中由于家庭人口多，负担重，有吃少穿的现象也还不少的，也应当适当地给以照顾。还有各机关部门大多有职工宿舍，而中等学校里则并无这种设备，个人租房，困难万端，房租价钱也很高昂，教师住家有的离校十几里路，披星戴月，往返奔波，不但浪费了许多宝贵的时间，也影响了工作的质量和身体的健康。尤其女教师们，因为托儿所的问题没有解决，困难情形便更加严重。若能对以上问题适当地予以解决，一定能解除教职员工的许多顾虑，对提高教育质量上，一定能收到相应的效果。
    ⒊克服忙乱现象。关于中等学校中的忙乱现象问题，经上级领导一再注意改进，已经克服了不少。但一般说来，会议多，学习多，社会活动多，忙乱的现象也还有一定程度的存在。尤其是各种工作很容易集中在少数积极分子身上，越是积极分子便越显得忙乱。这一点由于近来教职员中普遍地要求进步，涌现了大批的新的积极分子，当能斟酌情况，适当地予以改进和调整。也希望上级领导在理论学习、业务学习以及各种工作会议的安排上，做一个全面的规划，尽可能地克服忙乱现象，使教师的精力能集中于改进工作和业务学习以及理论等学习上。
    党和政府对知识分子的关怀是无微不至的。关于知识分子的改造问题，知识分子的培养、使用和待遇等问题，党和政府一定能有全面的规划，采取各种措施，分别地予以解决。此外，最重要的也还要依赖知识分子的自身的努力。我们的社会主义革命已经在全国范围内广泛而深刻地展开了，我相信我们的一切知识分子，一定能配合这一种新的形势，努力改造自己，提高自己，发挥潜在能力和工作的积极性，更加紧密地团结于党的周围，献身于祖国的建设事业，使社会主义革命在全国范围内早日完成，使我们祖国以一个富强繁荣的、有高度文化的、社会主义工业大国出现于世界。
