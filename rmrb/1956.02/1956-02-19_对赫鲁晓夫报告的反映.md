    Reactions to Khrushchev's Report
    "Indian Express"
    The "Indian Express" editorial on February 16th stated that the Soviet foreign policy clarified by Khrushchev "is essentially consistent with the needs of many countries and the majority of the world's population."
    The editorial said: "While Western countries limit their vision and activities to a narrow aspect, the Russian leader proudly announced the Panchsheel principles and declared his willingness to conduct serious negotiations on disarmament and help develop backward countries."
    The editorial concluded by discussing the recent Eisenhower-Eden talks and the decision of the United States and Britain to continue nuclear weapons testing, stating: "As a contrast, Khrushchev's speech on stopping hydrogen bomb tests became an appeal for peace."
            Egyptian Newspapers
    "Al Gomhuria," commenting on Khrushchev's report, stated that Khrushchev's report outlined the program of Soviet foreign policy. Khrushchev called for improving relations between the Soviet Union and Britain, France, and the United States. The newspaper wrote that the Soviet Union advocates peaceful coexistence, opposes war, advocates the prohibition of atomic weapons, and curbs all those who threaten peace.
    "Al-Ahram" pointed out the peaceful intentions of the Soviet policy announced by Khrushchev, as well as the Soviet efforts to consolidate and expand cooperation among countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence. It said: "Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union advocates strengthening friendly relations with all countries that desire peace. ...Russia does not want war."
            Syrian Newspapers
    Syrian newspapers all published summaries of Khrushchev's report at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the front page. "Al-Chaum" had a banner headline: "Khrushchev Declares the Five Principles are the Basis of Russia's Relations with Other Countries," "Al-Mass" had a banner headline: "Khrushchev Asks Western Countries to Accept the Bandung Conference Principles," "Al Ayam" had a banner headline: "Russia Strives to Strengthen Friendship with All Countries."
    "An-Nasr" commented on Khrushchev's report: "When Soviet Communist Party First Secretary Khrushchev presided over the opening of the Communist Party Congress, he said that the Five Principles are the basis of Soviet foreign policy. He said that the Soviet Union strives to consolidate friendship with India, Burma, Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, and all other countries that are unwilling to participate in aggressive treaties."
            French Newspapers
    "L'Express" emphasized the great international significance of the congress. It wrote: "Due to Russia's weight in world politics, this event has become the most important event in the world today…"
    Paris newspapers reported in detail this part of Khrushchev's report: Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems has always been and remains the general direction of Soviet foreign policy.
    A commentator for "La Voix de la Nation" particularly emphasized the part of the report on the path of different countries transitioning to socialism.
    "Les Echos" emphasized that the keynote of the opening of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was optimism.
    "L'Humanité" emphasized that Khrushchev's report talked about "the strength of the Soviet Union, the desire to fight for peace, and the invincible power of this socialist country."
            West German Newspapers
    West German and West Berlin bourgeois newspapers emphasized in large headlines the point in Khrushchev's report that war is not inevitable.
    The Social Democratic "Telegraf" published in its commentary the announcement that the Soviet Union will implement a seven-hour workday during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and a six-hour workday for underground workers. The newspaper considered this decision a "sensational event."
