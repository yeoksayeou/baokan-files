Build Farmland Water Conservancy, Eliminate Drought and Flood Disasters!
Even Arid Areas Can Quickly Eliminate Ordinary Droughts
Xu Da

In a large part of northern China, such as the Loess Plateau, mountainous areas, and sandy areas, agricultural production has been relatively backward, and the lives of the masses have been relatively impoverished due to the serious threat of drought over the years. These areas generally have little rainfall, mostly concentrated in the three or four months of late summer and early autumn, and mostly heavy rain. The remaining eight or nine months have very little rainfall. The ground lacks vegetation cover and has a small capacity to absorb and retain rainwater. Farmland is eroded by heavy rain and wind, fertile soil is lost year by year, the land is barren, and its water retention capacity is poor.

The reason these areas are arid and poor is mainly due to social conditions, in addition to the impact of unfavorable natural conditions. After liberation, the feudal land system was abolished, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement was launched, eliminating the social factors that caused drought, which made it possible for us to eliminate ordinary drought disasters in these areas.

In the past few years, on the basis of the rapid development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in these areas, mountains have been closed for afforestation, trees and grass have been planted, terraced fields have been built, soil has been improved, and soil erosion has been reduced or prevented year by year. Many places have also dug canals, sunk wells, and built a large number of water storage projects such as ponds, water cellars, dams, and small reservoirs, developed irrigation or used floodwater to silt up land, gradually changed the appearance of arid areas, and increased agricultural output. Some have also developed forestry, animal husbandry, and fruit production.

Shiquanhu Village in Junan County, Shandong Province, was originally a small, arid village in the Yimeng Mountains. The land plots were small and scattered. As the masses said, "A bowl-sized or ladle-sized piece of land can be covered by three or four buttocks." The land was barren and water sources were scarce. In the past, even drinking water had to be carried from seven or eight miles away, and dishwater had to be used repeatedly before it was thrown away. However, after liberation, the village gradually improved its economic situation by planting trees and forests and repairing terraced fields year by year. In the winter of 1954, all the farmers in the village joined agricultural cooperatives and began to build reservoirs. This small village of 43 households with 42 male and semi-male laborers spent more than 4 months, using more than 20,000 cartloads of soil and 7,000 cartloads of stone, and more than 2,600 workdays to complete a reservoir more than 2 zhang deep and more than 10 mu in size. It not only solved the village's water use problem but also irrigated 300 mu of land. Last year, it began to receive irrigation benefits. While building the reservoir, it also deeply plowed more than 140 mu of land, improved more than 30 mu of soil, repaired 32 mu of land, and planted more than 13,000 trees. Thanks to these construction measures, the average income per person in the village reached 1,089 jin of grain last year. Last winter, the village began to build a second reservoir, which is expected to irrigate 450 mu of land, accounting for 84% of the existing cultivated land area, by next year. At that time, the village will have an average of 2 mu and 3 fen of irrigated land per person.

Yangjingdi Township in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, was originally a rocky mountainous area with extremely scarce water sources. More than ten years ago, due to blind reclamation and indiscriminate logging, the ground cover was destroyed, so that during heavy rains, "water flows down the mountains and floods are large, and when the rain stops, the sky is dry and the land suffers." In 1950, the township began to close mountains for afforestation and repair terraced fields. In 1953, it also formulated a 15-year development plan for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy in the township. In the past three years, young forests have been cultivated on the barren mountain tops in the village, more than 70 mu of terraced fields have been built on the slopes, 198 gully dams have been built in the gullies, and dikes have been built and willows have been planted along the gullies to fix the gullies. The 3- to 4-li-long Kulong Gully and the 38 small pieces of land next to the gully in the township have been connected into a fertile field after flood silting; in addition, a reservoir has been built. Last year, the township was already in the rainy season, "water seeps in as soon as it falls, and there is no flood, and water flows for many days after the rain." It not only reduced the threat of drought but also reduced flood disasters. Last year, the average income per person in the township was equivalent to more than 1,300 jin of grain, and it is estimated that it will reach 6,542 jin after the 15-year plan is realized.

Villages like this can be found in many drought-stricken counties. Although these areas have relatively weak labor and financial resources and relatively unfavorable natural conditions, the situation immediately changed after the farmers embarked on the road of mutual aid and cooperation. After joining agricultural cooperatives, farmers in these areas quickly overcame the difficulties of insufficient labor and financial resources, overcame or changed unfavorable natural conditions, and launched a struggle against drought. Some have eliminated ordinary drought disasters, and some can eliminate ordinary drought disasters within three to five years. In the future, production in these areas will gradually develop, human and material resources will become more and more abundant, and the experience of overcoming drought will inevitably be enriched year by year. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, and under the guidance of overall planning, it is entirely possible to universally eliminate ordinary drought disasters within 7 to 12 years.

    兴修农田水利，消灭旱涝灾害！
    干旱地区也能很快消灭普通旱灾
    徐达
    在我国北方有很大一部分地区，如黄土高原地区、山区和风沙地区，历年遭受干旱的严重威胁，农业生产比较落后，群众生活比较贫困。这些地区大都雨量不多，并且多集中在夏末秋初三、四个月，又多暴雨，其余八、九个月降雨很少。地面缺少草木覆盖，吸收含蓄雨水能力很小，耕地又因暴雨冲刷和风力剥蚀，肥沃土壤逐年流失，地力瘠薄，保水能力差。
    这些地区所以干旱贫困，除了由于不利的自然条件影响之外，主要还是由于社会条件造成的。解放以后，废除了封建的土地制度，开展了互助合作运动，消除了造成干旱的社会因素，这就使我们有可能在这些地区消灭普通的干旱灾害。
    几年来，这些地区在农业互助合作运动迅速发展的基础上，逐年实行封山育林，植树种草，兴修梯田，改良土壤，减轻或制止了水土流失。许多地方还开挖了渠道，打了水井，大量修建了池塘、水窖、坝堰和小型水库等蓄水工程，发展了灌溉或引用洪水淤地，逐步改变了干旱地区的面貌，提高了农业产量。有的还发展了林业、牧业和果品等生产。
    山东省莒南县石泉湖村，原来是沂蒙山区的一个干旱的小村，地块小而分散，照群众的说法是：“碗大瓢大的地一屁股坐下三四块。”土地瘠薄，水源缺乏，在过去，连吃水都要到七、八里外去担，刷锅水都要反复用几次才肯倒掉。但是解放以后，这个村逐年植树造林，修整梯田，经济情况已经逐渐改善。1954年冬全村农民都加入了农业合作社，开始动工兴修水库。这个43户42个男整半劳力的小村，在4个多月的时间，用了2万多车土和7，000多车石料，2，600多工，完成了2丈多深、10多亩大的一座水库，不但解决了全村用水问题，还可浇地300亩。去年已经开始收到灌溉效益。在兴修水库的同时，还深翻地140多亩，改良土壤30多亩，修地32亩，种树13，000多株。由于这些建设措施，去年全村每人平均收入达到1，089斤粮食。这个村去年冬季又开始兴修第二座水库，预计到明年全村水浇地将达到450亩，占现有耕地面积的84％。那时全村每人平均将有2亩3分水浇地。
    山西省平顺县羊井底乡，原来也是一个水源极其缺乏的石山区，十几年前，由于盲目开荒和滥伐树木，破坏了地面被复，以致大雨时期“水顺山流洪水大，雨停天干地遭殃”。1950年这个乡开始封山育林，修整梯田。1953年又制定了全乡15年农、林、牧、水利的发展规划。三年来，这个村的荒山顶上已经育起幼林，山坡修成了梯田70多亩，在山沟内建谷坊198道，沿沟修堤植柳，固定沟道。这个乡三、四里长的窟窿沟和沟旁的38小块土地，经过洪水淤淀已经联成一块肥沃良田；此外还修了一座蓄水池。去年这个乡在雨季已经是“随下随渗无洪水，雨后多日水长流”。不但减轻了干旱威胁，还减轻了洪水灾害。去年全乡平均每人收入折合粮食1，300多斤，预计15年规划实现以后，可达6，542斤。
    像这样的乡村，在许多干旱的县份都可以找到。这些地区尽管劳力、财力比较薄弱，自然条件比较不利，但是在农民走上互助合作的道路以后，情况立即发生了变化。这些地区农民加入农业合作社以后，迅速克服了劳力和财力不足的困难，战胜了或改变了不利的自然条件，开展了抗旱斗争，有的已经消灭了普通旱灾，有的在三、五年内即可消灭普通旱灾。这些地区今后生产将会逐年发展，人力物力也将越来越充裕，战胜干旱的经验也必然逐年丰富，在党和政府的领导下，在全面规划的指导下，7年到12年内普遍地消灭普通的旱灾是完全可能的。
