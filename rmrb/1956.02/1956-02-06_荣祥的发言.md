Comrades Chairmen, Committee Members, and Fellow Comrades:

I have listened to Premier Zhou's political report and the special reports of the four Vice-Chairmen, and after group study and discussion, I express my full support.

Now I would like to say a few words on the "Issue of Intellectuals," especially regarding Premier Zhou's statement that "intellectuals should be given due trust and support," which I would like to briefly discuss.

From a socialist standpoint, for intellectuals to gain the Party's trust and support is also to gain the trust and support of the broad masses of working people, which is a most noble and unparalleled honor. Our beloved Premier Zhou solemnly announced at such a grand meeting, on behalf of the Party and the government, that "intellectuals should be given due trust and support," which truly deserves intellectuals' "leaping three hundred times and dancing three hundred times" in excitement and jubilation.

While excitement is certainly warranted, we should also consider whether the Party and the government's trust and support for intellectuals is only beginning today. Personally, I believe it is not starting now but has already been given, starting from the very first day of liberation. When all of China was undergoing liberation, as soon as a certain area was liberated, the call of the Communist Party to unite with intellectuals was immediately heard. Indeed, this was the case, as every liberated area provided intellectuals with ample opportunities to participate in political construction, production construction, and various social activities, regardless of the establishment of political power. Is this not a glorious trust that old intellectuals never dared to hope for in the new society? Intellectuals received this glorious trust in the early days of liberation before they had made any concrete contributions to the revolutionary cause. I personally give this trust a "fabricated" name, calling it "advanced trust," or, in our local dialect, "long-term trust." From the perspective of intellectuals towards the Party, this "long-term trust" implies that intellectuals are in debt, as if they were "debtors." Since intellectuals owe the Party and the people this "advanced trust" debt, it is only fair that they must strive to repay it.

However, for six years, our intellectuals have not made satisfactory efforts to repay this "advanced trust," yet we have received even greater trust from the Party at this conference. This time, the trust is comprehensive and specific, including "trust," "support," "utilization," "arrangement," "work," and "treatment," and even provides significant "assistance" during "self-remolding." This is many times greater than the trust that has been given in the past six years. If conscience is something everyone has, then how can Premier Zhou's "calling from a high place" not move the broad masses of intellectuals? I believe that under the Party's wise call, the intellectuals of all nationalities in our motherland will inevitably launch a high tide of socialist self-remolding, which is certain. This is a manifestation that cannot be avoided under the encouragement of the Party's trust.

However, intellectuals should not regard the trust given by the Party and the people, time and again, as something "easily picked up" or easily obtained, nor should they think that having knowledge gives them the inherent right to be trusted. Both of these understandings are wrong. We should know that those who have knowledge but do not serve socialism are worthless. While the Party gives intellectuals trust, it also places hopes on them. Premier Zhou's report clearly states this hope, which is that they "gradually grow into intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve socialism." Isn't that clear? The many trusts given by the Party are only exchanged for a reward of serving socialism.

As for how to serve socialism, Premier Zhou and Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo have spoken extensively and given clear instructions, so there is no need for me to "add feet to a snake." It is enough for all of us to sincerely "believe, accept, and practice." My speech is finished. I wish all Chairmen and Committee Members good health.

    荣祥的发言
    各位主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听了周总理的政治报告和四位副主席的专题报告，经过了小组的学习讨论，我表示完全拥护。
    现在我想就“关于知识分子问题”说几句话，特别是对于周总理所说“应该对知识分子给以应有的信任和支持”这一点，我想简单地谈一谈。
    从社会主义的立场来看，知识分子能得到党的信任和支持，也就是得到了广大劳动人民的信任和支持，这是一种最高贵无比的光荣。我们敬爱的周总理在这样隆重的大会上，代表党和政府庄严地宣布了“应该对知识分子给以应有的信任和支持”，这真是值得知识分子们“距跃三百，屈踊三百”地兴奋欢呼的。
    兴奋诚然值得兴奋，可是我们也应该再想一想，党和政府给予知识分子的信任和支持，是从今天才开始的么？我个人认为决不是从现在才开始，而是早已给过的，是从解放的第一天起就已经开始了的。当全中国进行解放时期，某一地区一旦获得解放，立刻就听到共产党发出团结知识分子的召唤声。事实也正是这样，每一获得解放的地区不论政权建制或生产建设以及各种社会活动都给知识分子以充分参加的机会。这难道不是旧知识分子绝不敢希望在新社会取得的一种光荣信任么？知识分子在解放初期对革命事业还没有作出任何具体贡献就已取得这种光荣的信任，我个人给这种信任取个“杜撰”的名字，叫作“预支的信任”，拿我们当地的土话来说也可以叫作“长支信任”。这种“长支信任”从知识分子对党来说，知识分子是有亏欠的，仿佛是个“债务者”。知识分子对党对人民既然负了“预支信任”之“债”，说公道话那就必须努力补偿。
    可是我们知识分子6年以来对“预支的信任”还没有做满意的补偿努力，却又在这次会议上接受了党支给我们更多更大的信任。这次的信任包括的很全面也很具体，它有“信任”，有“支持”，有“使用”，有“安排”，有“工作”，有“待遇”，在“进行自我改造”时还给以一个意义伟大的“帮助”。这比6年以来所曾经给予的信任不知又扩大了多少倍。如果说良心是人人都有的话，那末，周总理这次“登高一呼”怎能使广大的知识分子无动于衷呢？我想在这次党的英明号召下，我们祖国各民族的知识分子也必然要掀起一个社会主义自我改造的高潮，这是可以肯定的。因为这是在党的信任鼓舞之下不能不有的一种表现。
    但是知识分子也不应该把党和人民所一次再次地给予的信任看成是“俯拾即是”轻而易得的东西，更不应该认为有了知识就有了当然获得信任的权利，这两种体会都是错误的。我们应该知道有知识而不为社会主义服务的人是一钱不值的。党对知识分子一面给以信任，一面也寄予希望，试看周总理的报告里就曾说明这种希望，那就是希望“逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子”。这还不明白么？党所给予的许多信任就只换一个为社会主义服务的报偿。
    至于怎样为社会主义服务，周总理和郭沫若副主席的报告讲的很多，指示的很明确，用不着我来“画蛇添足”。我们大家只是真诚地“信受奉行”就够了。我的话完结。敬祝各位主席、各位委员身体健康。
