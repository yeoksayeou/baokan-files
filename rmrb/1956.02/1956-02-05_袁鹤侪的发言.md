    Yuan Hechai's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I was very excited to hear Premier Zhou's political report. The report pointed out that, internationally, the brilliant achievements of socialist countries in their construction and their consistent adherence to the policy of peaceful coexistence have won widespread welcome and support from peace-loving people around the world. The friendly relations between our socialist countries and all countries willing to maintain peace are also developing daily. However, the policies pursued by the imperialist aggressive blocs are encountering increasingly strong resistance from peace-loving people of all countries, putting them in an increasingly isolated position in the world.
    Domestically, the entire nation is heading towards socialism, and a scene of joy and encouragement is appearing everywhere. More than 60% of the nation's farmers have responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to implement agricultural collectivization, setting off a high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture. The collectivization of handicrafts and the complete public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce nationwide are also reaching a high tide. In major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, the complete public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce, the collectivization of handicrafts, and the collectivization of agriculture in the entire suburban areas have continued to be realized. Our country has successfully completed the third year's tasks of the First Five-Year Plan. Facts show that the speed of our country's construction of socialism is rapidly advancing, and along with the development of industry, agriculture, and capitalist industry and commerce on the socialist road, it is also necessary to adapt and develop health and medical services. The health undertaking is an integral part of the Five-Year Plan. Developing medical services is an important item for improving the people's welfare, and it is also an indispensable part of coordinating economic construction and ensuring the health of the working people.
    In the six years since liberation, under the leadership and attention of the Party and the government, health and medical care have made considerable progress. In the past three years, the promotion of traditional Chinese medicine, the exchange of academic knowledge between Chinese and Western medicine, the establishment of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the expansion of hospitals have all achieved great success. However, due to our country's long-term rule by imperialism and reactionary feudal forces, our science and technology have not been well developed. Although there has been great progress and improvement since liberation, the general technical level is still felt to be insufficient, and the number of cadres who have mastered the modern level of science and technology is still in the minority. Especially in terms of the number of health personnel, it is far from keeping up with the needs of the current high tide of socialism. Therefore, on the one hand, it is urgently necessary to cultivate a large number of new medical personnel and improve the technical level of existing medical workers to enrich our health team, which is the most pressing task at present.
    On the other hand, promoting traditional Chinese medicine is not conservative; it requires our Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to work closely together to integrate the theories and clinical experience of Chinese and Western medicine into a useful and brand-new Chinese medicine. Chairman Mao said: Good health, good study, and good work. This shows that physical health is the basic condition for learning and working. We must do a good job in health and medical care in order to complete the current important tasks, develop with the development of socialism, meet the needs and aspirations of the people, safeguard the health of the people, and strengthen the forces for socialist development. The prospects of socialist society can be overfulfilled and realized at an early date within the Third Five-Year Plan.

    袁鹤侪的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听到周总理的政治报告非常兴奋。报告中指出，关于国际方面，社会主义阵营各国在建设中所获得的辉煌成就，和一贯坚持的和平共处政策赢得了世界各国爱好和平人民的广泛欢迎和支持。我们社会主义国家，同一切愿意保持和平的国家之间的友谊关系，也日益发展。而帝国主义侵略集团所执行的政策，却遭受到爱好和平的各国人民日益坚强的反抗，使他们在世界上处于日益孤立的地位。
    在国内方面，全国人民奔向社会主义，到处都出现一片欢欣鼓舞的景象。全国农户已有60％以上响应中国共产党和毛主席的号召，实行农业合作化，掀起了农业的社会主义改造的高潮。全国手工业的合作化和资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营，也跟着进到高潮。在北京、上海、天津、沈阳、重庆、武汉、广州各大城市，资本主义工商业全部公私合营，手工业的合作化和整个郊区农业的合作化，已经继续实现。我国发展第一个五年计划的第三年的任务，已经胜利完成。从事实看来，可以说明我国建设社会主义的速度，是飞跃猛进的，随着工业、农业以及资本主义的工商业向社会主义道路上的发展，还须适应的发展卫生医疗事业。卫生事业是五年计划的组成部分。发展医疗事业，是提高人民生活福利的要项，也是配合经济建设的进行和保证劳动人民的健康不可缺少的一部分。
    解放六年以来，在党和政府的领导和重视下，卫生医疗方面，已有了相当的进展。近三年来，祖国医学的提倡，中西医学术的交流，中医研究院的成立以及医院的扩建等等，都有很大的成就。但是，由于我国过去长期受着帝国主义和反动的封建势力的统治，使我们科学技术未能很好的发展，虽然在解放后有了很大的进展和提高，一般的技术水平，还感觉不够，掌握现代科学技术水平的干部，还在少数，尤其在卫生人员的数量方面，远远赶不上目前社会主义高潮的需要。因之，一方面急须大量培养新的医务人员和提高现有的医务工作人员的技术水平，把我们卫生队伍充实起来，是目前最迫切的任务。
    另一方面，发扬祖国医学不是保守的，是要我们中西医紧密的携起手来，把中西医学的理论和临床经验贯彻成为有体有用而崭新的中国医学。毛主席说过：身体好、学习好、工作好。这是说明了人身的健康，是学习、工作的基本条件，必须把卫生事业搞好，才能完成目前的重要任务，才能随着社会主义的发展而发展，才能满足人民的需要和愿望，才能维护人民的健康，加强社会主义发展的力量，社会主义社会的远景，才能在第三个五年计划之内超额完成而早日实现。
