Comrades and Committee Members:

　　I am attending this meeting with great excitement as our country enters a great period of socialist revolution and construction. I fully support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of the leading comrades.

　　I am a steel bar worker from the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company. Over the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with the care and support of the people throughout the country, and with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, all the workers of Anshan have achieved certain successes in building the country's first iron and steel base. However, our construction speed is not fast enough, the production quantity is not large enough, the project quality is not good enough, the use of raw materials is not economical enough, the production equipment has not been fully utilized, and there is still much potential in production that has not been fully exploited. After listening to the reports of the leading comrades at this meeting, my confidence in building socialism has become even stronger. We will definitely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, thoroughly carry out socialist emulation, and increase labor productivity. We must produce and construct more, faster, better, and more economically, to ensure the comprehensive, early completion and overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan. We will use our practical actions in heavy industrial construction to support the high tide of the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises and individual handicrafts throughout the country, to support the cooperative movement of peasant brothers throughout the country, to support the struggle of the people throughout the country to liberate Taiwan and bring the 8 million compatriots in Taiwan back to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, and to defend peace in Asia and the world.

　　In order to carry out large-scale and technically complex industrial construction, and to be able to master it well and fully utilize the efficiency of machinery and equipment after construction, it is not something that can be solved solely by labor enthusiasm and courage. It is necessary to improve cultural and scientific knowledge and technical level, it is necessary to learn from scientists and engineering technicians, and it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation and unity between workers and engineering technicians. For example, in the construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Large Rolling Mill and other projects, I and my group comrades created assembly line operations, and improved and created 14 kinds of production tools, which increased work efficiency by more than one time on average. Now about 90% of the operations in our work section are mechanized, saving a lot of labor and reducing physical labor, and keeping up with the needs of the processing and ordering departments. These improvements and creations would not have been possible without the help and cooperation of engineering technicians. Therefore, I think that what Premier Zhou pointed out in his report is very correct. In the future, in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call for more, faster, better, and more economical socialist construction, we must continue to redouble our efforts to study culture and technology under the cultivation and education of the Party, humbly learn from scientists and engineering technicians, strengthen the cooperation and unity between workers and engineering technicians, and rapidly improve our production technology level. At the same time, we must also keep our eyes open, draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and jointly contribute the greatest strength to the socialist construction cause of the motherland!

    各位委员、各位同志：
    我以非常兴奋的心情在我们国家进入一个伟大的社会主义革命建设时期，来参加这次会议。我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和各位领导同志的报告。
    我是鞍山钢铁建设公司的钢筋工人。我们鞍山全体工人，几年来在党中央、毛主席的正确领导下，在全国人民的关怀和支援下，在苏联专家无私的帮助下，在建设祖国第一个钢铁基地的工作上取得了一定的成绩。但是我们建设速度还不够快，生产数量还不够多，工程质量还不够好，对原材料的使用还不够省，对生产设备还没有完全利用，生产中还有许多潜力没有充分发挥出来。在这次会议上，听了各位领导同志的报告，促使我建设社会主义的信心更加充足。我们一定响应党中央和毛主席的号召，深入开展社会主义竞赛，提高劳动生产率，要更多、更快、更好、更省地进行生产和建设，保证全面地提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划。我们要用自己在重工业建设上的实际行动，支援全国私营工商业和个体手工业改造的高潮，来支援全国农民兄弟的合作化运动，支援全国人民解放台湾、使800万台湾同胞早日回到祖国怀抱，保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争。
    为了进行规模巨大、技术复杂的工业建设，在建设起来以后又能很好地掌握它，充分发挥机器设备的效能，这就不是单凭劳动热情和勇敢所能解决的问题，必须提高文化科学知识和技术水平，必须要向科学家和工程技术人员学习，必须要加强工人和工程技术人员的合作和团结。比如，在建设鞍钢大型轧钢厂等几项工程当中，我和我们小组的同志创造了流水作业，前后改进和创造了14种生产工具，平均提高工作效率一倍以上，使我们的工段现在有90％左右的操作都实行了机械化，节省了不少人工，还减少了体力劳动，赶上了加工订货部门的需要。这些改进和创造，如果不是在工程技术人员的帮助和合作下，是不可能成功的。因此，我认为周总理在报告中所指出的是非常正确的。今后为了响应毛主席对社会主义建设事业的又多、又快、又好、又省的号召，一定要在党的培养和教育下，继续加倍的努力学习文化和技术，虚心地向科学家和工程技术人员学习，加强工人与工程技术人员的合作和团结，迅速地提高我们的生产技术水平，同时也要擦亮眼睛，划清敌我界限，肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，共同为祖国社会主义建设事业贡献出最大的力量！
