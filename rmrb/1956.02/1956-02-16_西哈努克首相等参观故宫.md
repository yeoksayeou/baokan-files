Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sihanouk and members of the Cambodian National Delegation led by him visited the Palace Museum this morning, where they viewed artifacts dating from 2,000 BC to the modern era.

Accompanied by Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, and others, Prince Sihanouk and his entourage first visited the three main halls of the Palace Museum. In the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the distinguished guests viewed the "Exhibition of Ancient Art," featuring items from 2,000 BC to 1911 AD. This included painted pottery from 2,000 BC, a large ding (ancient cooking vessel) from the Warring States period, as well as lacquerware, jade carvings, and porcelain from the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Next, Prince Sihanouk and others visited the "Dunhuang Art Exhibition" at the Palace Museum. This exhibition reflects the evolution and development of Chinese classical art over approximately 1,000 years, from the 4th to the 14th centuries, including replicated exquisite murals, caisson ceilings, and border decorations from the Jin to Yuan dynasties, as well as replicated painted sculptures. At the front of the exhibition, the distinguished guests visited an exhibition room arranged according to Cave 285 of Dunhuang. This exhibition room was replicated in its original state by the Fine Arts Group of the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute over two years. The magnificent murals and painted sculptures displayed here showcase the brilliant achievements of Chinese art in the 6th century AD.

Finally, the distinguished guests also admired famous paintings such as Han Xizai's Night Banquet (from the Five Dynasties period) and Along the River During the Qingming Festival (from the Song Dynasty) in the Shufangzhai Studio, toured the Imperial Garden of the Palace Museum, and visited the Clock Exhibition Room of the Palace Museum.

    新华社15日讯　柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和他所率领的柬埔寨王国国家代表团人员今天上午游览了故宫，在那里参观了珍藏的从公元前两千年到现代的文物。
    西哈努克亲王等一行由中华人民共和国文化部副部长郑振铎等陪同，首先参观了故宫的三大殿。在太和殿里，贵宾们观看了从公元前两千年到公元1911年的“古代艺术品陈列”。这里有公元前两千年的彩陶，战国时代的大鼎，以及明、清的漆器、青玉雕刻和瓷器等文物。
