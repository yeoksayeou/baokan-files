Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: The World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau sent a telegram to the Austrian Federal Government stating: The World Federation of Trade Unions has always been a consultative body of the United Nations. Within the United Nations Economic and Social Council and its affiliated bodies, it has carried out excellent activities to improve the economic and social status of working people in all countries. The Austrian Ministry of the Interior's order prohibiting this organization from carrying out activities on Austrian territory, and seizing and closing the World Federation of Trade Unions headquarters' office, is a completely undemocratic act that violates the principles of the United Nations Charter and completely ignores the common aspirations of working people in all countries. Obviously, this behavior is detrimental to the neutrality policy solemnly declared by the Austrian government, and it also goes against the wishes of peace-loving people in all countries and the Austrian people.

The telegram concluded: We, representing the common will of workers in Asian and Australian countries, demand that you immediately revoke the order prohibiting the World Federation of Trade Unions from carrying out activities on Austrian territory, and cease the illegal seizure of the World Federation of Trade Unions headquarters' office and the persecution of World Federation of Trade Unions personnel.

    世界工联亚澳联络局抗议奥政府的无理决定
    据新华社15日讯　世界工联亚澳联络局打电报给奥地利联邦政府说：世界工联一直是联合国的咨询团体，它在联合国经社理事会及其所属机构中，为改善世界各国劳动人民的经济、社会地位，进行了优异的活动。奥地利内政部下令禁止这一团体在奥地利领土上进行活动，并侵占和封闭了世界工联总部的办公处，是完全违反了联合国宪章的原则，极端忽视世界各国劳动人民的共同愿望的反民主行为。显然，这种行为是有损于奥地利政府所庄严宣布了的中立政策的，也是违背世界各国爱好和平的人们和奥地利人民的愿望的。
    电报最后说：我们代表亚澳各国工人的共同意志，要求你们立即撤消禁止世界工联在奥地利领土上进行活动的命令，并停止对世界工联总部办公处的非法侵占，和对世界工联人员的迫害。
