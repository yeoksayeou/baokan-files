    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I am an industrialist and businessman engaged in the film industry. I feel extremely excited and honored to participate in this grand meeting. I fully support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of the several vice-chairmen.
    I would like to talk about my feelings and my past mistakes.
    From the nation's First Five-Year Plan, I saw the various provisions related to the development of the film industry, and I saw our country's high concern for improving the people's cultural life. Just in terms of the development of the film industry, the scale is very grand. What excites me the most is that our country will begin construction in 1956 of a new film washing and printing factory with an annual output of 45 million meters, and in 1957 will begin construction of a new film studio capable of producing 4 to 8 color feature films per year, as well as a new film stock factory with an annual output of 65 million meters of film stock. This cannot help but remind me that before liberation, because I was running American films, I was often unreasonably extorted by the American Big Eight companies for damages, demanding that we pay huge amounts of compensation. In 1949, I went to Hollywood in the United States to visit the filming of color films. The studio only allowed my daughter and me to visit. Two Americans asked to go with us, but the bosses refused. Why was this? Because in their view, the Chinese had no way to build their own color feature film studio. Letting the Chinese see it would not affect their interests, but could instead help them find markets and sales channels. As for the Americans? They were afraid that they would see the filming secrets and start a factory to compete. Thinking about it today, that visit was not about welcoming us, but about contempt, ridicule, and exploitation. I also went to Rochester, USA, and visited the Kodak film factory, from raw film to the entire production process of cutting out film stock and printing color photos. At the time, I had an unspeakable admiration in my heart, thinking that the United States was truly powerful, technically superb, and I was greatly impressed. Today, with the Party, with Chairman Mao, in just a few short years after liberation, we are actually able to build factories to manufacture film stock. How exciting is this! From the grand scale of the Five-Year Plan and the amazing achievements the country has made in all aspects over the past six years, I have clearly seen the bright future of our great motherland, and I have recognized my own national inferiority complex and the shameful idea of blindly worshiping the United States. In the future, the people of the whole country and intellectuals, scientists, and technologists will unite more closely around the Party, exert their active forces, and with the selfless help of the Soviet Union, it is entirely possible to emerge in the world as a brand-new socialist industrial power in a not-too-long period.
    I went to American missionary schools to study since I was a child, and I was subjected to the enslaving education of American imperialism for a long time. I believed that the United States was the most materially developed country in the world. Therefore, I sent my two daughters and a son-in-law to study in the United States, and another daughter to France to study painting. Before the liberation of Kunming, I myself went to the United States for sightseeing. In the spring of 1950, progressive friends in China sent me telegrams asking me to return to the country. Because I did not have a clear understanding of the Party, although I was willing to come back, I had concerns in my mind. Originally, my eldest daughter's studies had come to an end and she could have returned with me, but I left her in France to study further. Before returning to China, I agreed with my daughters that when I wrote to them from China, if the letter ended with the two characters "母字" (mǔ zì, "mother's writing"), it meant I was telling the truth; if I used the two characters "妈妈" (māmā, "mama"), it meant I was lying and they should understand it from the opposite. At the same time, I agreed with Yunnan merchants in Hong Kong that they would provide my daughters with foreign exchange, and I would provide their families with living expenses in Kunming. I used this method to escape funds abroad. During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, I was afraid that the United States would invade and drop atomic bombs, and I was also afraid that it would cause World War III, believing that France would be the first to suffer in Europe. I asked someone to write to my daughters in France, telling them to go to the United States as soon as possible. During the Five-Anti Campaign, I thought that the workers were ungrateful and treated me too harshly. In short, in the two or three years after liberation, I had a lot of resistance to the Party and the government. I praised the Party and the People's Government on the surface, but my real thoughts were not like that. Especially when the government's measures conflicted with my personal interests, my resistance was even more serious. Before 1953, I had always used the characters "妈妈" (māmā) to sign letters to my daughters, ostensibly telling them to come back, but actually telling them not to come back. I thought that there was no freedom under the rule of the Communist Party, and I was afraid that they would suffer if they came back. Thanks to the Party's patient education and help over the past six years, especially in the past three years, I have personally witnessed the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the unprecedented improvement of the country's international position, the rapid development of the country's various construction undertakings, the improvement of the lives of the broad masses of working people day by day, and the political and economic security of industrialists and businessmen by the government. The Party and the government constantly pointed out that industrialists and businessmen have a bright future as long as they accept socialist transformation. My thinking gradually changed, and I realized the shamefulness of worshiping the United States, being pro-American, and recognizing thieves as fathers. I realized the ugliness of the bourgeoisie's profit-seeking, unearned income, and the baseness of my past words and deeds that were inconsistent between my words and actions towards the Party and the government. New thoughts gradually cleared my mind, which had been blinded by personal self-interest, and the depression and annoyance caused by personal plans gradually decreased. I then resolutely wrote letters asking my daughters to come back, always signing "母字" (mǔ zì), not "妈妈" (māmā). But at this time, my daughter and son-in-law in the United States were unable to obtain exit permits. My daughters in France returned to China on schedule at the end of 1953. I was very happy to think that my family could reunite soon. I wrote to them saying that I was preparing to fly from Kunming to pick them up two days before they arrived in Guangzhou. As a result, something went wrong again. Those who were about to return temporarily would not return, and my daughter in the United States even wrote saying that they had asked a friend in Hong Kong to buy me a plane ticket, asking me to go out and reunite with them as soon as possible. This shocked me very much. Where did this come from! I replied that we would definitely reunite, but the location was here, not elsewhere. On the one hand, I tried to find out why they wrote the letter. Later, I learned that they had misunderstood my action of going to Guangzhou to pick them up as a hint that I wanted to take the opportunity to go to Hong Kong. This made me deeply realize how serious the negative impact I had sown on my daughters in the past few years was! Not only did it affect their patriotic enthusiasm and prevent them from returning to participate in the construction of the motherland earlier, but it would also affect many patriotic people's yearning for the motherland, and provide reactionaries and imperialists with pretexts to spread slander and sabotage. My behavior is deeply sorry to the country and the people, and I have unspeakable regret and shame.
    At this moment, when the people of the whole country are marching towards socialism with unparalleled enthusiasm, and under the banner of socialism, are beginning to march towards science, towards eliminating the roots of class and exploitation, backwardness and poverty, on the victorious road, I must study hard, transform my thinking, be dutiful and responsible in the enterprise, strive to develop my labor skills, and use my exemplary actions to motivate and influence more industrialists and businessmen to further accept socialist transformation. In addition to requesting the government to negotiate with the US government to ask them to fulfill the agreement for civilians to return home, I must faithfully and truthfully introduce the brilliant achievements that the motherland has made under the leadership of the Party and the various great measures in the future to my daughters, relatives and friends abroad, and strive for them to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible and contribute to the construction of socialist society.

    刘淑清的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我是一个经营电影事业的工商业者，此次参加这个盛会，感到无比兴奋和光荣。我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和几位副主席的报告。
    我愿谈一谈我的感想和我过去的错误。
    我从国家第一个五年计划中，看到有关发展电影事业的各项规定，看到我们国家对于提高人民文化生活水平的高度关怀，单就发展电影事业一项来说，气魄就是非常伟大的。其中最使我兴奋的是，我们国家在1956年将开始新建年产4，500万公尺的电影片洗印厂，1957年将开始新建每年能够摄制4部至8部彩色故事片的制片厂，并新建一个年产胶片6，500万公尺的电影胶片厂。不禁使我想起解放前，我因经营美国电影，经常因为损坏，受到美国8大公司无理勒索，要我们付出数目巨大的赔偿。1949年我曾到美国好莱坞参观拍摄五彩影片，制片厂只许我和我的女儿去参观，有两个美国人要求与我们同去参观，遭到了老板们的拒绝。这是为了甚么呢？是因为在他们看来，中国人是没有办法能够自己建立五彩故事片制片厂的，让中国人看了不会影响他们的利益，反而可以替他们找市场找销路。对于美国人呢？则诚恐他们看见了摄制秘密，开厂竞争。今天想来，那次的参观，他们对我们不是甚么欢迎，只是轻蔑、嘲笑、利用而已。我又曾到过美国罗撒斯特城，参观过柯达胶片厂，从生胶起一直到电影底片切制出来，五彩相片洗印出来的全部生产过程。当时内心有说不出的羡慕，认为美国真是力量雄厚，技术高超，大有叹观止矣之慨。今天呢，有了党，有了毛主席，在解放短短几年中，居然能够建厂制造胶片了，这是何等令人兴奋的事情！从五年计划的伟大规模，和六年来国家在各方面的惊人成就中，使我看清楚了我们伟大祖国的光辉前途，认识了自己民族自卑感和盲目崇拜美国的可耻思想。今后全国人民和知识分子科学技术家们，更紧密团结在党的周围，发挥积极的力量，并有苏联的无私帮助，在不很长的时期中，以一个崭新的社会主义工业大国出现于世界，是完全做得到的。
    我自幼就进美国教会学校念书，长期受美帝国主义的奴化教育。我认为美国是世界上物质文明最发达的国家。因此，我把我的两个女儿、一个女婿都送到美国去念书，另一个女儿送到法国去学画。昆明解放之前，我自己也跑到美国去游览。1950年春，国内的进步朋友们打电报要我回国，由于我对党没有明确的认识，虽然愿意回来，但思想有顾虑。本来大女儿学业已告一段落可以随同我一道回国的，但我将她留在法国再念书。回国之前，我和我的女儿们约好，在我由国内写信给她们，信末以“母字”两个字署名，说的就是真话；如用“妈妈”二字，说的就是假话，要她们从反面理解。同时，我与香港的云南商人约好，由他们供给我女儿们的外汇，我在昆明供给他们家属的生活费。我用这办法来把资金逃往国外。抗美援朝当中，我怕美国打进来丢原子弹，我还怕因此引起第三次世界大战，认为在欧洲首先遭殃的一定是法国。我辗转托人写信给在法国的女儿们，叫他们赶快去到美国。五反运动中，我认为工人恩将仇报，对我太过火。总之，在解放后两三年中，我对党和政府的抵触抗拒情绪是多的，我表面称颂党，歌颂人民政府，但真实的思想不是这样。尤其政府的措施与我个人利益抵触的时候，我的抵触情绪更加严重。在1953年以前，我一直都用“妈妈”二字署名写信给女儿们，表面在信上叫她们回来，实际上是叫她们不回来。我认为在共产党统治下不自由，怕她们回来会吃苦不舒服。由于党六年来对我的耐心教育和帮助，特别近三年来我亲眼看见抗美援朝的胜利，国家在国际地位上空前提高，国家的各项建设事业以一日千里的速度发展，广大劳动人民的生活一天比一天改善，工商业者在政治上、生活上都受到政府的保障，党和政府不断指出工商业者只要接受社会主义改造是有光明前途的，我的思想逐渐发生了变化，认识到崇美亲美认贼作父思想的可耻，认识到资产阶级唯利是图不劳而食种种思想行为的丑恶，认识到过去对党和政府表里不如一的种种言行的卑劣。新的思想渐渐使我原来被个人私利蒙蔽了的头脑清醒起来，为个人打算而产生的苦闷和烦恼渐渐减少。我才坚决写信要女儿们回来，就一直署名“母字”，不署“妈妈”了。可是这时，在美国的女儿女婿已无法获得离境证。在法国的女儿们则定期在1953年底回国，我满心愉快地认为骨肉可以很快团聚，写信告诉她们说，我准备在她们到达广州的前二日我由昆明乘飞机去接她们，这么一来事情又发生问题了，她们要回来的暂时不回来了，而且在美国的女儿还来信说，她们已托香港朋友代我购买飞机票，要我快些出去和她们团聚。这使我非常吃惊，这话是从何说起！我除回信说，我们肯定要团聚，但地点是在我这里，而非别处。一面设法探听她们写信的原因。后来才知道，她们把我去广州接她们的行动误会成为想借此去到香港的暗示，这使我深深认识到几年来我对女儿们在思想上所种下的恶劣影响是多么严重！不仅影响她们的爱国热忱，不能早些回来参加祖国的建设，还会因此影响许多爱国人士对祖国的向往，并资反动派和帝国主义以宣传诬蔑破坏口实。我的这种行为深深的对不起国家，对不起人民，真有说不出来的悔恨和惭愧。
    当此全国人民以无比奔放的热情，向着社会主义大踏步前进，在社会主义旗帜下，开始向科学进军，向消灭阶级和剥削、落后和贫困的根源进军的胜利道途中，我要很好学习，改造思想，在企业里守职尽责努力锻炼自己劳动本领，以模范行动带动影响更多的工商业者进一步接受社会主义改造。除请求政府向美国政府交涉要他们履行平民回国的协议外，我一定要把祖国在党领导下已取得的光辉成就和今后的各种伟大措施，忠忠实实的介绍给在国外的女儿们、亲友们，争取她们早日回到祖国的怀抱，在建设社会主义社会中尽到一分力量。
