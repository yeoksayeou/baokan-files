Revolutionary Poet, Warrior
Commemorating the Centenary of Heinrich Heine's Death
Wu Boxiao
Heine is the greatest lyric poet in Germany after Goethe, a brilliant political commentator and satirical writer.

Heine was born on December 13, 1797, in Düsseldorf on the Rhine, to a Jewish family of modest means. As a child, he loved reading Cervantes' "Don Quixote" and often cried with anger at the misfortunes suffered by the brave knight. He began writing poetry at the age of 15. "The Grenadiers" is one of his early works.

Heine's father hoped he would become a businessman, sending him to commercial schools and placing him in a Hamburg trading house, where he worked as a commissioner for an English textile company. But Heine loathed commerce and soon transferred to Bonn to study law.

In Berlin, Hegel guided Heine in his philosophical studies. Hegel's philosophy had a significant influence on the development of Heine's mind. Heine wrote treatises such as "On the History of Religion and Philosophy in Germany."

Heine's achievements in law, religion, and philosophy would have been remarkable had he not been even more famous for his poetry. But his poetry enjoys even greater world renown. His poetic career began as a singer of Romanticism. In "Book of Songs," "Youthful Sorrows," and "Lyrical Interludes," he celebrated the happiness of childhood, the memories of love, and the love of his mother. He also used various fantasies to depict fairy-tale India, buried cities, moonlit landscapes... In his "Harz Journey," there are quiet houses, dense forests, streams, flowers, and grasses, the happy songs of birds, as well as lovely shepherd boys in vast pastures and beautiful girls in simple farmhouses. At the same time, his poems and essays are interspersed with sharp satires and biting mockery of brutal and foolish rulers and vulgar philistines. Heine, based on the tradition of German folk poetry, combined national forms with modern progressive democratic content.

In the travel poem "The North Sea," Heine wrote about various aspects of the sea. Fantasies, legends, fresh and magical scenes, sometimes full of deep emotion, make the reader a close friend of the poet; sometimes humorous and satirical, the poems leave thorns in people's hearts; more often, they are the poet's own memories, sorrows, and hopes. Literary historians say he was the first in German poetry to make people hear the roar of the ocean and its infinite changes and power.

Heine's satire of reactionary forces and autocratic order is extremely sharp. In the long poem "Atta Troll," describing rain, he exclaims, "I would trade thirty-six kings for an umbrella." After finding shelter from the rain, he exclaims again, "I would trade thirty-six kings for a warm robe." Can we fail to understand that this is directed at the thirty-six independent states of the German Confederation at that time? The German Confederation was established after the reactionary "Holy Alliance" was formed in 1815. It preserved all the characteristics of feudal separatism: all the princes and dukes were obsessed with autocratic order, opposed the liberal movement, and exercised universal censorship. Under the oppression of reactionary rule, the dissemination of democratic ideas was extremely difficult. Representatives of German democracy had to hint at their protests against the current system in their works of poetry and philosophy. "Young Germany" was a young literary group that struggled against absolutism and the reactionary Chief Minister of Austria at the time—the Metternich system. One of the outstanding writers who gave "Young Germany" great encouragement and influence was Heine. In "Germany: A Winter's Tale," Heine wrote about the Prussian eagle:
	You ugly bird, when
	You fall into my hands,
	I will tear off your feathers,
	And chop off your claws with an axe.
	Then put you on a pole,
	Raising you high into the air,
	And gather the sharpshooters of the Rhineland,
	For a hearty shooting session.

Heine was a warrior who fought for democratic ideals. He used poetry and prose to call on his compatriots to wake up from a century of dreams. In the travelogue "From Munich to Genoa," he wrote: "Put a sword on my coffin, for I am a brave warrior in the war of human liberation."

At this time, Heine should be said to be a realist.

Because of his resistance to autocratic order, his closeness to France, his non-Germanic blood, and his bold attitude against religion, Heine was discriminated against by the reactionary rulers in his native Germany, and his poems and essays were often censored. In 1830, the French July Revolution was greeted with rejoicing by Heine, but this revolution did not cause any political changes in Germany. From 1831, Heine was forced to live in exile in Paris. From that time on, France was his second home. With the attitude of a "revolutionary drummer" and a warrior political commentator, he plunged into the French socialist movement and wrote many works reflecting the social problems of the time. On November 7, 1842, he wrote to Heinrich Laube: "I am, so to speak, the most resolute of revolutionaries." The influence of his revolutionary political essays led the German reactionaries to take police measures, until the parliament banned the publication of his books in Germany. On June 15, 1843, during the rapid progress of the workers' movement, he wrote: "The Communist Party is the only party in France worthy of respect." This shows his intellectual brilliance and his far-sightedness. Although his understanding did not reach a thorough level.

In December 1843, Heine met Marx in Paris, and they became very close and familiar with each other. Once, Heine wrote a letter asking Marx to forgive him for "writing in a disorderly and scribbled manner," saying, "For our mutual understanding, a few strokes are enough." When Marx was about to leave Paris in February 1845, he wrote in a letter to Heine: "Among the people here, the one I am least willing to part with is Heine, and I wish I could pack you in my luggage too." Marx helped Heine's political development a lot. Marx saw Heine not only as a poet but also as a warrior. Heine participated in the work of the "German-French Yearbook" sponsored by Marx, so 1844 was the most memorable year in Heine's life. That year, Heine wrote immortal poems such as "Germany: A Winter's Tale," "The Silesian Weavers," and "Song to Emperor Louis"—a satire of the King of Bavaria. Heine also admired Marx very much. He once said: "In the struggle against the status quo, the proletariat has the right to demand the most progressive thinkers and the greatest philosophers as their leaders." This correct and frank statement undoubtedly refers to Marx.

In "The Silesian Weavers," the poem expresses the poet's confidence in the ultimate liberation of the proletariat. "Germany: A Winter's Tale" is the finest and most complete of Heine's creations and the peak of Heine's poetry. It is thoroughly filled with a spirit of satire and revolutionary optimism. He himself said that the "free air" of Paris "sharply permeates many chapters." The poem writes about his journey from the Prussian border to Hamburg, each stage showing his wisdom and mockery. The chapters on "Redbeard's Horses" and the chance encounter with Hamburg's "Patron Saint" Hammonia on the street are very brilliant. Although, as Heine said in the preface, because it was not suitable for the German climate, it was "revised to make the serious sound unnecessarily more blunt, or to completely cover it up lightly with the humorous ring of bells," we can still see the burning of his patriotic enthusiasm and his relentless attack on the hypocrites of national essence. This long poem is filled with a noble political atmosphere, and from beginning to end, it runs through a basic theme—revolution. Heine was always loyal to the German people. In "English Fragments," he said: "Ah, German fatherland! Dear German people! … The day of liberation is approaching, a new era is beginning, … The night has passed, and a dawn is rising outside the window…."

Heine did not live to old age. The paralysis of the eyelids, which had long caused him pain, became severe in 1848 and gradually spread throughout his body. But while bedridden, he continued to work tirelessly, writing true and brilliant poems. On February 17, 1856, Heine passed away, at the age of less than 60. Now it has been exactly 100 years since his death. But his poetry is alive and will live on for a long time. (Attached picture)

    革命的诗人、战士
    纪念亨利希·海涅逝世一百周年
    吴伯箫
    海涅是歌德以后德国最伟大的抒情诗人。是光辉的政论家、讽刺作家。
    海涅于1797年12月13日生在莱茵河畔杜塞尔多夫城一个并不富裕的犹太家庭里。幼年喜欢读塞万提斯的“堂·吉呵德”，常常为了那勇敢骑士所遭受的灾难气得哭起来。15岁开始写诗。“掷弹兵”就是早期的作品。
    海涅的父亲希望他成为一个商人，送他到商业学校学习过，送他进过汉堡的商行，在一家英国纺织制品公司作过特派员。但是海涅非常厌恶商业，很快就转到波恩学习法律。
    在柏林，黑格尔曾指导海涅从事哲学研究。黑格尔的哲学对海涅的心灵的发展有过很大的影响。海涅曾写有“论德国宗教和哲学的历史”一类的论著。
    海涅，若不是更以诗著名，他在法律宗教和哲学方面的研究成就会很显著。可是他的诗却更具有世界的荣誉。他的诗人活动是以一个浪漫主义者的歌手开始的。在“歌诗集”“青春的烦恼”和“抒情的插曲”里，他歌颂童年的幸福，恋爱的回忆和母亲的慈爱，也用各种各样的幻想描绘童话般的印度，被埋没了的城市，月色风景……。在他的“哈尔次山游记”里边有幽静的房舍，茂密的森林，溪流花草，百鸟欢歌，也有广阔的牧场里可爱的牧童和纯朴的农家里美丽的女孩。同时，在诗文里也穿插着一段段对残暴愚蠢的统治者、庸俗的市侩的尖锐的讽刺和辛辣的嘲笑。海涅根据德国人民诗歌的传统，把民族形式跟现代进步的民主主义内容结合起来。
    海涅在游记诗“北海”里边写了海的各个方面。幻想、传说、新鲜神奇的景象，有时情意深长，使读者都变成诗人的密友；有时幽默讽刺，诗句在人们的心里留下了刺；更多的是诗人自己的回忆、哀伤和希望。文学史家说他是德国诗中第一个使人听到海洋的咆啸和它无穷的变幻和威力的。
    海涅对反动势力、专制秩序的讽刺是极为尖锐的。在长诗“阿塔·特洛尔”里描写下雨时，他喊道：“愿以36个国王换一把雨伞。”等找到了避雨的地方他又喊：“愿以36个国王换一件温暖的长袍。”我们不能了解这是针对那时德意志联邦里36个独立邦说的么？德意志联邦是在1815年反动的“神圣同盟”缔结之后建立的。它保存了封建割据的一切特征：所有王公诸侯都醉心于专制秩序，反对自由主义运动，行使普遍检查制度。在反动统治压迫的底下，民主思想的传播是非常困难的。德国民主主义的代表们只好在诗歌和哲学等的著作里暗示自己对现行制度的抗议。“青年德意志”就是跟专制主义和当时奥地利反动的总长——梅特涅制度进行斗争的青年文学团体。给“青年德意志”以巨大的鼓舞和影响的杰出的作家之一，就是海涅。海涅在“德国——一个冬天的童话”里写普鲁士荒鹫说：
      你这丑恶的鸟，什么时候
      你若落在我的手里，
      我就撕去你的毛羽，
      用斧斩断你的脚爪。
      然后把你放在竿上，
      高高地向空中撑起，
      再召集莱茵州的枪手，
      来一次痛快的射击。
    海涅是为民主理想而斗争的战士。他用诗和散文呼唤自己的同胞从百年的迷梦中醒来。他在游记“从慕尼黑到热内亚”里写道：“放一把剑在我的棺材上吧，因为我是人类自由战争中的一个勇敢的武士。”
    这时的海涅应当说是现实主义者。
    海涅，由于他对专制秩序的反抗，由于他对法兰西的亲近。由于他的非日耳曼血统，也由于他反宗教的大胆的态度，在他的祖国德意志是被反动的统治者所歧视的，诗文也常被查禁。1830年法国七月革命，海涅表示了欢欣鼓舞，然而这次革命并没引起德国政治上任何变革，从1831年海涅就被迫侨居巴黎。从那个时候起，法国是他的第二故乡。他以“革命的鼓手”、政论家的战士姿态勇猛地投入了法兰西社会主义运动，写了很多反映当时社会问题的作品。1842年11月7日他写信给亨利希·劳伯说：“我，不妨说，是革命家中最坚决的一个。”他的革命政论文章所发生的影响，使德国反动派采取了警察手段，直到国会禁止在德国刊行他的书籍。在工人运动迅速进展的1843年6月15日他写道：“共产党是法国唯一值得尊敬的政党。”可以看出他思想的卓越，眼光的远大。虽然他的这一认识并没达到彻底的程度。
    1843年12月海涅在巴黎跟马克思认识，彼此很亲密、很熟悉。有一次海涅写信请马克思原谅他“写得紊乱潦草”，说：“为了我们互相了解，有几笔也就够了。”马克思1845年2月要离开巴黎的时候写给海涅的信里也说：“在这里的人们中间，我最不愿与之离别的就是海涅，我恨不得把您也装进我的行李里去。”马克思对海涅政治上的发展帮助很大。马克思看海涅不但是一个诗人，而且是一个战士。海涅参加了马克思主办的“德法年报”的工作，因此1844年是海涅生平中最可纪念的一年。那年海涅写了“德国——一个冬天的童话”“西利西亚的纺织工人”和“路易皇帝赞歌”——讽刺巴威利亚国王的——等不朽的诗篇。海涅对马克思也很推崇。他曾经说：“在反抗现状的斗争中无产阶级有权要求最进步的思想家、最伟大的哲学家作为他们的领袖。”这正确坦率的论断无疑是指马克思说的。
    在“西利西亚的纺织工人”里，表现出诗人对无产阶级最后解放的信心。“德国——一个冬天的童话”是海涅创作中最优秀最完整的作品，是海涅诗歌的高峰。里边彻头彻尾充满着讽刺精神，革命的乐观主义精神，他自己说巴黎的“自由空气尖锐地贯注在许多章节里”。这诗写他从普鲁士边境到汉堡的一次旅行，每个阶段都显示了他的智慧和嘲弄。中间“红胡子的马匹”和跟“汉堡的守护神”汉莫尼亚在街头邂逅相遇的两章是非常精彩的。虽然像海涅在序里所说的，因为不适合德国气候，“修改到使严肃的声音不必要地更加钝滞，或者用幽默的铃声轻快地完全把它掩盖。”我们依然看得出他爱国主义热情的燃烧和对国粹主义的伪君子们的无情的抨击。这一首长诗洋溢着高尚的政治气息，从头到尾贯穿着一个基本的主题——革命。海涅始终是忠实于德国人民的。在“英国断片”里他这样说过：“啊，德意志祖国啊！亲爱的德意志人民啊！……解放的日子临近了，新的时代开始了，……黑夜过去了，窗外正升起一片朝霞……。”
    海涅没有活到老年。早就使他痛苦不堪的眼睑麻痹症，到1848年厉害起来了，逐渐扩展到全身。但卧病中他还是不断劳动，写着真实的、光辉的诗章。到1856年2月17日，海涅去世了，当时不满60岁。现在他死去已经整整100年了。可是他的诗是活着的，并且将长远地活下去。（附图片）
