Editorial: Accelerate the Completion of the Creation of Minority Languages

    China has a minority population of approximately forty million, of which about twenty million people belonging to minority groups do not have their own commonly used written languages, or their written languages are incomplete. Although most of these ethnic regions have implemented regional autonomy and have completed or are preparing for democratic reforms, their autonomous organs cannot yet use their own languages to perform their duties. This situation must be changed as quickly as possible.

    Minorities without written languages face many difficulties, with education and production being the most pressing. Some minority cooperatives cannot find talents such as accountants and have to resort to primitive methods such as knot-tying, wood-carving, straw-counting, and bean-counting to assess work and record points. They urgently hope to have their own written languages. With written languages, they can train enough accountants and other talents in a short period, promoting the smooth development of the agricultural cooperation movement. They can also use their own languages for teaching in ethnic schools, eliminate illiteracy, and enable the broad masses of people to use their own languages to study the Party's policies and relevant scientific knowledge. Moreover, they can record their own history and develop their excellent cultural traditions, and absorb the experiences of other ethnic groups in the motherland in political, economic, and cultural construction. This will rapidly improve their cultural and material lives.

    The Chinese Communist Party has always advocated actively helping minority groups develop their languages. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, as early as 1951, the Government Administration Council decided to help ethnic groups without written languages create them. Over the past few years, ethnic language workers from the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Institute for Nationalities, and other relevant institutions have organized numerous ethnic language survey teams to conduct surveys and research in minority areas, according to the instructions of the Party and the government. They have surveyed the languages of the Zhuang, Yi, Miao, Buyi, Dai, Kawa, Hani, Yao, Lisu, Nong, Naxi, Lahu, and Jingpo ethnic groups in southern and southwestern China, and the languages of the Mongolian, Uygur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Dongxiang, Tu, Daur, Oroqen, Xibe, and Tajik ethnic groups in northern, northeastern, and northwestern China. They have helped the Yi people in Sichuan and the Zhuang people in Guangxi design preliminary phonetic writing schemes, and helped the Dai people in Yunnan and several other ethnic groups design preliminary writing improvement schemes. However, it should be pointed out that the work of helping minority groups create written languages has not yet adapted well to the needs of national construction, nor has it fully met the demands of minority people. The main reasons are: in the work of helping minority groups create written languages, there is a conservative ideology, and they dare not boldly organize and use new forces, especially the forces of minority groups themselves; the cooperation between the relevant institutions in their work is also not good enough, so this work cannot be carried out simultaneously in many ethnic groups. In addition, there are too few backbones in the work, and their experience is insufficient, which is also a difficulty. For example, when helping the Yi people design the "New Yi script" scheme, due to lack of experience, the selected dialect lacked broad representativeness. Some cadres in some areas did not fully recognize the importance of this work and did not give strong support. All of these have hindered the progress of the work to some extent.

    Now, we have favorable conditions to accelerate the completion of the work of creating minority languages: (1) We have already collected some dialect materials for many ethnic languages and accumulated some experience. Soviet advisors and experts have systematically introduced the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in creating, improving, and reforming the written languages of minority groups, based on China's specific conditions, and have put forward many valuable suggestions for the development of ethnic language work in China. (2) The professional level of the original cadres has been greatly improved, and new forces have gradually grown up, so that this team has been greatly strengthened. (3) Encouraged by the continuous new victories of the minority people in the cause of socialist construction, their demands for creating, improving, and reforming written languages are even more urgent. After several years of work, the minority people have a deeper understanding of the Party's and government's policies on the development of ethnic languages. Therefore, they will definitely strongly support and actively participate in this work. We can and should now comprehensively carry out this work.

    At the National Ethnic Language Scientific Symposium held last December, representatives from various regions unanimously affirmed the past achievements, pointed out the shortcomings in the work, exchanged experiences, and discussed a comprehensive ethnic language work plan. This plan stipulates that within two years (1956-1957), a general survey of the languages of all minority groups will be conducted, and those ethnic groups that need to create, improve, and reform written languages will be helped to design writing schemes. According to this plan, all ethnic groups in China, except for a very few special cases, will create and use their own written languages, which in fact realizes the constitutional provision on "all ethnic groups have the freedom to use and develop their own languages." This will play a great role in the rapid development of cultural education and other construction undertakings of all ethnic groups. The complete realization of this plan will naturally encounter some difficulties, but these difficulties can be overcome, and the conditions for realizing this plan are fully available. Faced with this arduous and urgent task, the national ethnic language workers must do everything possible to ensure its successful completion.

    Creating, improving, and reforming the written languages of various ethnic groups is both a serious political task and a meticulous scientific work. While carrying out the work and speeding up the pace, we must ensure the quality of the work. In order to achieve this goal, we must strengthen leadership and unify our steps. Every ethnic language worker must have a global perspective, abide by unified regulations, and do their best to meet the requirements of various tasks. The leading organs should be responsible for strengthening the contact and cooperation between the work in various regions. All language work teams should sum up experience at any time, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the theory of language science, improve working methods, and improve work efficiency. Experienced scientists should patiently train young scientific workers so that new forces can continue to grow. The forces in language survey and research, language teaching, and compilation and publishing work should cooperate with each other. The leading organs at all levels responsible for ethnic affairs, education, culture, and other work must include this work in the work plan of their units and share certain responsibilities. Local Party committees should strengthen the leadership of the local ethnic language work; all relevant institutions must attach great importance to it and allocate appropriate forces so that this work can be carried out more smoothly, and so that the culture of all ethnic groups in China can develop rapidly.

### 加速完成创立少数民族文字的工作

    加速完成创立少数民族文字的工作
    我国少数民族人口约有四千万，其中有两千万左右人口的少数民族至今还没有自己通用的文字或者有文字而不完备。虽然在这些民族的地区里，绝大部分也已经实行了区域自治，并且完成了或者准备进行民主改革，但是，他们的自治机关还不可能使用自己的语言文字执行职务。这种情况必须尽快地加以改变。
    没有文字的少数民族，困难很多，目前在教育和生产方面最感困难。有些少数民族的合作社找不到会计员一类的人才，不得不用结绳、刻木、掐草秆、数豆粒等原始的方法来评工记分。他们迫切希望有自己的文字。有了文字以后，就可以在短时间内培养出足够的会计员和其他人才，推动农业合作化运动顺利地发展；也就可以在民族学校中使用本民族文字教学，扫除文盲，使广大人民群众都能运用自己的文字学习党的政策和有关的科学知识；也就可以用自己的文字记载本民族的历史和发展他们优秀的文化传统，吸收祖国各民族在政治、经济和文化建设方面的经验。这样就能使他们的文化生活和物质生活得到迅速的提高。
    中国共产党历来就主张积极地帮助少数民族发展他们的语言文字。中华人民共和国成立以后，早在1951年，政务院就决定了要帮助没有文字的民族创立文字。中国科学院语言研究所、中央民族学院和其他有关机构的民族语文工作者们，根据党和政府的指示，几年来先后组织了许多个民族语言调查队，到少数民族地区进行调查研究。在我国南部和西南部调查了僮、彝、苗、布依、傣、卡瓦、哈尼、瑶、傈僳、侬、纳西、拉祜、景颇等民族的语言，在北部、东北部和西北部调查了蒙古、维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、东乡、土族、达呼尔、鄂伦春、锡伯、塔吉克等民族的语言，帮助四川彝族、广西僮族设计了初步的拼音文字方案。帮助云南傣族和其他几个民族设计了初步的文字改进方案。但是，应该指出，帮助少数民族创立文字的工作，还不能很好地适应国家建设的需要，也还不能完全满足少数民族人民的要求。主要原因是：在帮助少数民族创立文字的工作中，存在着保守思想，不敢大胆地组织、使用新生力量，特别是少数民族的力量；各有关机构在工作上的相互配合也做得不够好，因而不能同时在许多民族中展开这一工作。此外，工作中的骨干太少，经验不够，当然也是一种困难。例如，在帮助彝族设计“新彝文”方案的时候，由于经验不够，就曾经发生过选择的方言缺乏广泛的代表性的缺点。还有些地区的干部对这项工作的重要意义认识不足，没有给予大力的支持。这些都在一定程度上阻碍了工作的进展。
    现在，我们已经有了加速完成创立少数民族文字工作的有利条件：（一）对于许多民族语言已经搜集了一些方言的材料，并且积累了一些经验。苏联顾问和专家已经针对我国的具体情况，系统地介绍了苏联少数民族创立、改进和改革文字的先进经验，并且对我国民族语文工作的开展提出了许多宝贵的建议。（二）原有干部的业务水平已经提高了很多，新生力量也逐渐成长起来，这支队伍已经大大地增强了。（三）少数民族人民在社会主义建设事业不断取得新的胜利的鼓舞下，对于创立、改进和改革文字的要求更加迫切。经过几年来的工作，少数民族人民对党和政府发展民族语文的政策也有了更深刻的了解，因此，他们必然会大力支持并且积极参加这项工作。我们已经可以而且有必要全面地开展这一工作了。
    在去年12月举行的民族语文科学讨论会上，各地代表们一致肯定了过去的成绩，指出了工作中的缺点，交流了经验，讨论了一个全面的民族语文工作规划。在这个规划中，规定在两年（1956—1957）内普遍调查各少数民族语言，帮助那些需要创立、改进和改革文字的民族进行文字方案的设计工作。根据这个规划，我国各民族除极少数特殊情况以外，都将创立和使用本民族的文字了，这就在事实上实现了宪法上关于“各民族都有使用和发展自己的语言文字的自由”的规定。这对于各民族的文化教育及其他建设事业的迅速发展，将起很大的作用。这个规划的彻底实现自然还会遇到一些困难，但是这些困难是可以克服的，实现这个规划的条件是完全具备的。全国民族语文工作者面对着这个艰巨而迫切的任务，一定要尽一切力量来保证它的胜利完成。
    创立、改进和改革各民族的文字既是一件严肃的政治任务，也是一件细致的科学工作。在开展工作和加快速度的同时，必须保证工作的质量。为了达到这个目的，必须加强领导，统一步调。每个民族语文工作者必须有全局观点，服从统一的规定，竭尽自己的力量，以达到各项工作的要求。领导机关要负责加强各地工作的联系与合作。各个语文工作队都要随时总结经验，学习苏联先进经验和语言科学理论，改进工作方法，提高工作效率。有经验的科学家应该耐心地培养青年科学工作者，使新生力量不断地成长起来。语言的调查研究，文字的教学，编译出版工作等方面的力量应该相互配合起来。各级负责民族事务、教育、文化等项工作的领导机关都必须把这一工作列入本单位的工作计划，分担一定的责任。地方党委要加强对当地民族文字工作的领导；各个有关机构要十分重视并且配备适当的力量，使这一工作能够更顺利地进行，使我国各民族文化迅速地发展起来。
