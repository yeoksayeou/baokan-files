The Yunguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Meiyun Township, Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, achieved an average yield of 1,277.58 jin of rice per mu (approximately 667 square meters) on its 102.9 mu of double-season rice fields last year (the early rice crop suffered a severe drought, with an average yield of only 384 jin per mu). Among them, two mu of high-yield land reached an annual yield of 2,020 jin per mu, setting a national record for the highest yield of double-season rice.

Meiyun Township is located downstream of the Rongjiang River in Jieyang County and belongs to the alluvial plain area. The soil is mostly loam or clay loam. Irrigation is entirely from river water, and the chance of drought is relatively small. Therefore, some people believe that Yunguang Cooperative was able to achieve such high yields last year due to its "unique advantages." In fact, this understanding is very wrong.

Lin Yancheng, the director of the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative, set the national rice yield record of 1,622 jin per mu of double-season rice in 1951. In the following three years, he continuously worked to increase the large-area yield, but the high-yield fields never broke through the 1,700 jin per mu mark. This made Lin Yancheng very distressed. In 1952, the Party branch educated and encouraged him to further improve farming techniques, implement close planting with small clusters, and visit the county's agricultural demonstration farm. However, he expressed doubts about whether close planting with small clusters could increase production. He said: My field is fertile, and close planting with small clusters is good, but I am afraid that the rice plants will easily lodge. It was not until 1953 that he selected two fen of land to start experimenting with close planting with small clusters. Because he was not completely convinced, he dared not apply fertilizer boldly, resulting in small ears and thin grains, and no increase in production. At this time, he even wondered if he had reached the "peak of production." Later, he heard that the Soviet Union had high yields of more than 2,000 jin per mu, and thought of the Party's care and expectations for him, and his courage to move forward was strengthened again. When planting the second-season rice in 1954, he conducted an experiment on 1.56 mu of land: half adopted close planting with small clusters with a row spacing of 6x7 cun (approximately 20x23 cm), and the other half still used sparse planting with large clusters with a spacing of more than one chi (approximately 33 cm). Not long after the seedlings were transplanted, he saw the rice seedlings of the close planting with small clusters growing vigorously upward. He was frightened and trembling, fearing early lodging, and repeatedly instructed the mutual aid team members not to topdress with fertilizer. Later, when the rice leaves turned red, he felt uneasy and only applied 20 jin of fertilizer. When the rice was about to turn yellow, the sparsely planted rice plants with large clusters lodged first, sticking to the ground; the closely planted rice plants with small clusters tilted down row by row, without sticking to the ground. At harvest time, the close planting with small clusters yielded more than 40 jin of rice per mu. At this time, Lin Yancheng said regretfully: "If I had boldly applied enough fertilizer, I could have harvested at least dozens of jin more." From then on, he completely believed that close planting with small clusters could increase production.

When planting early rice last year, he educated the cooperative members to adopt close planting with small clusters. The cooperative members had already seen the benefits of close planting with small clusters with their own eyes, so they were happy to accept it. All 102.9 mu of fields in the cooperative were planted with close planting with small clusters.

The Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative was only established in January last year. The cooperative's ability to obtain high yields is inseparable from the collective management of the agricultural cooperative.

Before the establishment of the cooperative, although most of the 34 households of farmers in the cooperative participated in mutual aid teams, they could not accept the idea of conducting experiments for technical reforms. Member Hailin once went to a meeting in the district and heard the district chief calling on all farmers in the district to implement close planting with small clusters. After returning home, he did not dare to publicize it to the masses. He thought: If I publicize it, I have to take the lead. If I take the lead and the harvest is not good in the future, wouldn't I suffer? He had to secretly say to Lin Yancheng: "The district chief wants you to experiment with close planting with small clusters." However, Lin Yancheng also thought this way: I only have more than 5 mu of land. If the experiment is unsuccessful, how will a family of nine live? Later, although he tried a few fen of land, he still had great concerns in his mind. The situation was different after the establishment of the cooperative. The agricultural cooperative managed the land in a unified way, and everyone's thinking changed: Using a few mu of land for experimentation, even if the experiment is unsuccessful, the loss is not great when averaged out among everyone; if the experiment is successful, the cooperative can promote it quickly, and everyone will be able to increase their income quickly. In this way, the entire cooperative more smoothly accepted technical reforms.

Furthermore, regarding the two mu of land that created the highest high-yield record for this cooperative last year, these two mu of land were separated into seven plots before the establishment of the cooperative, and were managed separately by seven households of farmers. On the west side of these two mu of land, there was a ditch, and water often flowed into the fields. In the three or four plots of land near the ditch, part of the land could not be winter-plowed every year because it was soaked in water, which affected the increase in production. For example, farmer Liejin had one plot of land in this area, and the average yield was only 1,225 jin of rice per mu each year; the total average yield of these seven plots of land was only 1,394.6 jin per mu. After the establishment of the cooperative last year, these seven plots of land were all managed by the cooperative in a unified way. The cooperative immediately opened a drainage ditch on the west side, so that the water flowing into the fields could be drained through the drainage ditch. In this way, all the rice fields could be winter-plowed, increasing production further.

The farmers in Meiyun Township have always been accustomed to using fertilizer and bean cake. This not only increased production costs, but also caused many fields to become "as hot as flint in the sun, and like plaster in the rain" due to the over-reliance on chemical fertilizers, leading to a lack of organic matter in the soil. After the establishment of the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative, it organized cooperative members to dig river mud and accumulate farm manure. 73% of the late rice fields in the cooperative were fertilized with natural fertilizers. This not only improved the soil quality, but also greatly reduced production costs. The average production cost of late rice per mu in the cooperative was only 8 yuan and 47 fen, which was 72.6% lower than in 1954. Among them, the average annual production cost per mu of the two mu of high-yield land that created high yields was only 14 yuan and 26 fen.

Can the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative continue to increase production in the future? Recently, they conducted a serious inspection and found that there were still many shortcomings in cultivation last year. For example, no base fertilizer was applied for late rice, and some cooperative members pulled and planted the seedlings randomly during transplanting, damaging the seedling roots and causing the rice seedlings to grow unevenly. Overcoming these shortcomings will result in even higher yields. This year, their production plan is: the average yield of more than 100 mu of rice in the cooperative should reach 1,752 jin per mu, and the 2 mu of high-yield fields are required to produce 2,150 jin per mu. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, many new technical measures have also been formulated. The cooperative has now prepared 83% of the base fertilizer for early rice.

    云光农业生产合作社是怎样创造全国双季稻高产纪录的
    李孝  曾志贤
    广东省揭阳县梅云乡云光农业生产合作社，去年全社102亩9分连作双季稻，每亩平均产稻谷1，277.58斤（早稻遭受严重的旱灾，每亩平均只有384斤）。其中两亩丰产地，每亩全年产量达到2，020斤，创造了全国双季稻最高产量的纪录。
    梅云乡在揭阳县榕江的下游，属于冲积平原区，土质大部分是壤土或粘质壤土。全部是利用河水灌溉，受旱的机会较少。因此，有些人便以为云光社去年能够取得高额的产量，是由于“得天独厚”。其实，这种认识是非常错误的。
    云光农业合作社的主任林炎城，在1951年曾经以双季稻每亩1，622斤的产量，创造了当时全国水稻产量的最高纪录，以后的三年中，他不断地努力提高大面积产量，但是丰产田一直没有突破每亩产量1，700斤的界线。这使得林炎城很苦恼。1952年党支部教育、鼓励他进一步改进耕作技术，实行小科密植，并且让他到县农业示范场去参观。但是他对实行小科密植能否增产表示怀疑。他说：我的田质肥，小科密植好是好，只怕田禾易倒伏。直到1953年，他才选择两分田，开始试验小科密植，因为顾虑没有彻底打破，不敢大胆施肥，结果穗小谷细，没有增产。这时他甚至怀疑是不是“增产到顶”了。后来，他听说苏联还有每亩2，000多斤的高额产量，又想到党对他的关怀和期待，继续前进的勇气又增强起来。1954年种二季稻的时候，他又在1.56亩田里进行试验：一半采用科行距6乘7的小科密植，另一半依然是一尺以上的大科疏植。秧苗插下不久，眼见小科密植的禾苗，使劲往上长，他心寒胆颤，怕早期倒伏，再三嘱咐互助组员，千万不可追肥。以后，禾叶转赤了，看见过意不去，才追施了20斤肥田粉。稻将黄了，大科疏植的，稻禾先倒伏，贴在地上；小科密植的，却一行接一行，倾斜下去，没有贴地。收割的时候，小科密植的每亩多收了40多斤稻谷，这时，林炎城懊悔地说：“如果大胆施足肥料，最少还可多收几十斤。”从此，他完全相信小科密植能够增产了。
    去年种早稻的时候，他便教育社员采用小科密植。社员已经亲眼看到小科密植的好处，因此也乐意接受，全社102亩9分田，都实行了小科密植。
    云光农业合作社是去年1月才成立的。这个社能够获得高额的产量，是和农业合作社的集体经营分不开的。
    建社前，这个社的34户农民，虽然大部分参加了互助组，但是一提到要进行技术改革的试验，组员就接受不下。组员海林，有一次到区里开会，听到区长号召全区农民实行小科密植，他回家后，不敢向群众宣传。他想：要是宣传了，自己就要带头去做，如果带头做了，将来收成不好，岂不是自己吃亏？他只好偷偷地对林炎城说：“区长要你试验小科密植。”但是，林炎城也这样想：我只有5亩多田，如果试不成功，一家九口，生活怎样过？后来，他虽然试了几分田，但是心里仍有很大的顾虑。建社后情况就不同了，农业合作社土地统一经营，大家的想法改变了：用几亩田来试验，就算试验不成功，大家平均起来，损失不大；试验成功了，社一推广，大家就能够很快地增加收入。这样，全社就较顺利地接受了技术改革。
    再从这个社去年创造最高丰产纪录的两亩田来说，这两亩田，建社前隔为七丘，由七户农民各自经营，在这二亩田的西面，有一水沟，常有水流入田里，在靠近水沟的三、四丘田，每年冬季因被水浸湿，便有部分不能进行冬耕，影响了增产。像农民烈金，在这片田中有1丘田，每年每亩平均才收1，225斤稻谷；这七丘田全部加起来，每亩平均的产量，也不过是1，394.6斤。去年建社后，这七丘田都由社统一经营，社立即在西面开了一条排水沟，使流入田里的水，都能由排水沟排去，这样，全部稻田都能进行冬耕，增加更多的产量。
    梅云乡的农民，向来习惯使用肥田粉、豆饼。这样，既增加了生产成本，又因偏用化学肥料，土壤缺乏有机质，很多田就变成“日出如火石，雨来似膏药”。云光农业社建立后，便组织社员去挖河泥、积农家肥料，全社晚稻田有73％是施的自然肥料。这样，既改良了土质，又大大降低了生产成本，全社晚稻每亩田平均生产成本才8元4角7分，比1954年晚稻降低了72.6％。其中两亩创造高额的丰产田，每亩田全年平均的生产成本，只有14元2角6分。
    云光农业合作社今后还能不能再增产呢？最近他们认真地进行了一次检查，发现去年在栽培方面还有不少缺点，例如，晚稻没有施基肥，在插秧的时候，还有部分社员乱拔乱插，损坏了秧根，使禾苗生长不一。克服了这些缺点，就能得到更高的产量。今年他们制定的生产计划是：全社100多亩水稻平均每亩产量达到1，752斤，其中2亩丰产田要求每亩产2，150斤。为了保证这个计划的实现，还订了许多新的技术措施，现在全社已经准备了早稻83％的基肥。
