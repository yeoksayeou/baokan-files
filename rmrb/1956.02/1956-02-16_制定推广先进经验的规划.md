    The employees of Shenyang Fan Factory guarantee to complete the first Five-Year Plan in 3 years and 11 and a half months. They decided to formulate a comprehensive plan for promoting advanced experience as a major method to ensure the early completion of the first Five-Year Plan. It has been initially determined that 47 kinds of advanced experiences will be promoted throughout the factory in the first quarter.
    Since July last year, while promoting management experience such as team economic accounting, the factory has promoted 7 kinds of advanced tools such as the Kolesov tool method and some advanced experiences such as molds in mechanical processing and other workshops, and achieved great results. For example, after the implementation in the mechanical processing workshop, the average production efficiency of the entire workshop increased by more than 30%. However, the promotion of advanced experience in the whole factory is uneven and not widespread. Some workshops have used it on more than 80% of the machine tools, while others have not yet promoted it; some workers have used the Kolesov tool method to increase efficiency several times, while others have only increased it by 10%. After inspecting the promotion of advanced experience last year, each workshop formulated a plan for promoting advanced experience in the first quarter of this year based on the opinions of the masses. In the plan, they meticulously stipulated which kind of advanced experience should be promoted to which type of work, which machine tool, what specifications of products, processing materials and precision, and what economic effects are expected to be achieved (including quality and quantity), and the specific measures to ensure the promotion of advanced experience (such as the supply of tools, requirements of the unit, person in charge and the date of resolution, etc.) were also included in the plan. The mechanical processing workshop decided that in the first quarter of this year, in addition to consolidating and improving the 7 kinds of advanced tools such as Kolesov and Chikilev that were promoted last year, and expanding the scope of use; the Zhuang Minggeng lathe operation method should be expanded from the current 4 pilot machine tools to 24 machine tools, and the efficiency should be increased by 12%. The preparation workshop plans to promote 9 kinds of advanced experience to 29 types of fan, with an average efficiency increase of 99%. In the plan, they also stipulated that they should promote advanced experience in business management such as team economic accounting and "no-material-requisition workdays".

    制定推广先进经验的规划
    沈阳扇风机厂职工保证以3年零11个半月的时间完成第一个五年计划。他们决定以推广先进 经验作为保证提前完成第一个五年计划的一项主要方法，制定了推广先进经验的全面规划。目前已经初步确定，第一季度要在全厂推行47种先进经验。
    去年7月以来，这个厂在推广班组经济核算等管理经验的同时，在机械加工等车间推行科列索夫车刀法等7种先进刀具和一些胎模等先进经验，取得了很大成绩。如机械加工车间推行后，全车间平均生产效率提高30％以上。但是，先进经验在全厂推行得不均衡不广泛。有的车间已经在80％以上的机床用了，有的车间还没推广；有的工人运用科列索夫车刀法提高效率几倍，有的只提高10％。各车间在检查去年推广先进经验的情况后，根据群众的意见，制定了今年第一季度推广先进经验的规划。在规划中，他们很细致地规定了那一种先进经验，推广到那个工种、那台机床，什么规格的产品，加工的材料和精密度，预计达到什么经济效果（包括质量和产量），并把保证推广先进经验的具体措施（如供应刀具，要求单位以及负责人和解决日期等），也订入规划中去。机械加工车间决定，今年第一季度除巩固和提高去年推行的科列索夫、奇基列夫等7种先进刀具，并且扩大使用范围外；要把庄铭耕旋床工作法由现在试点的4台机床，推广到24台机床，效率要提高12％。准备车间计划把9种先进经验推广到29种类型的扇风机上，平均提高效率99％。在规划中，他们还规定要推广班组经济核算和“不领原材料工作日”等经营管理方面的先进经验。
