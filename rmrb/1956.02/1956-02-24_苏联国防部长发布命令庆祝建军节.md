Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 23rd: According to TASS, Soviet Defense Minister and Marshal of the Soviet Union, G. Zhukov, issued an order on February 23rd, celebrating Soviet Army Day.

The order stated that this year's Soviet Army Day is being celebrated amidst the high tide of political and labor enthusiasm of the entire nation, aroused by the significant event in our country's life – the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people, united around the beloved Communist Party and its Leninist Central Committee, are firmly committed to realizing the great plans laid out by the Party.

The Soviet people, engaged in peaceful and constructive labor, are deeply concerned about a consolidated and lasting peace. The Soviet government has implemented a number of measures aimed at establishing mutual trust between countries. Thanks to the foreign policy pursued by the Soviet Union and the efforts of all peace-loving people, there has been some relaxation in international tensions. However, the aggressive blocs of imperialist countries are unwilling to consider the will and interests of all nations. They stubbornly continue to pursue a "position of strength" policy, which is dangerous to the cause of peace, establishing and expanding aggressive military blocs, and intensifying the arms race. This forces us to vigilantly watch the conspiracies of aggressive forces and continuously strengthen the defense capabilities of the Soviet motherland.

The servicemen of the Army, Navy, and Air Force should make new progress in improving their military technology, tenaciously master modern combat techniques and weapons, observe strict discipline, and do their best to improve vigilance and combat readiness.

I congratulate the soldiers, sergeants, officers, and generals of the Army and Navy on Soviet Army Day and wish them new achievements in combat and political training.

To celebrate the thirty-eighth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, I order: Today, February 23rd, twenty artillery salvos shall be fired in our motherland's capital, Moscow, in the capitals of the Union Republics, and in the hero cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa.

    苏联国防部长发布命令庆祝建军节
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科23日讯：苏联国防部长、苏联元帅格·朱可夫在2月23日发布命令，庆祝苏联建军节。
    命令说，今年的苏联建军节是在我国生活中的重大事件——苏联共产党第二十次代表大会——所引起的全国人民的政治和劳动热情高涨的气氛中庆祝的。苏联人民团结在亲爱的共产党和它的列宁式的中央委员会的周围，坚定地致力于实现党所规定的伟大计划。
    从事和平建设性劳动的苏联人民切身关心巩固的持久的和平。苏联政府执行了旨在建立国与国之间的相互信任的若干措施。由于苏联所执行的外交政策和全体爱好和平人民的努力使国际紧张局势取得了一定的缓和。但是，帝国主义国家侵略集团不愿意考虑各国人民的意志和利益。它们顽固地继续奉行着对于和平事业具有危险的“实力地位”政策，建立和扩大侵略性的军事集团，加强扩充军备。这就使我们不得不警惕地注视侵略势力的阴谋，不断地加强苏维埃祖国的国防力量。
    陆、海、空军军人应当在提高自己的军事技术方面有新的进步，顽强地掌握现代化的战斗技术和武器，遵守严格的纪律，尽力提高警惕性和战斗的准备。
    我向陆海军士兵、士官、军官、将军祝贺苏联建军节，并且祝他们在战斗和政治训练中取得新的成绩。
    为庆祝苏联建军三十八周年，我命令：今天，2月23日，在我们祖国的首都莫斯科，在各加盟共和国的首都，在英雄城市列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、塞瓦斯托波尔、敖德萨各鸣放礼炮二十响。
