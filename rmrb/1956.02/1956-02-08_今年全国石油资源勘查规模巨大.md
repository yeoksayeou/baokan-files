    This year, the national petroleum resource exploration will be on a huge scale
    At the recent national petroleum prospecting and exploration conferences separately convened by the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, it was decided that larger-scale petroleum resource exploration work will be carried out across the country this year in order to rapidly find a large number of oilfields to meet the needs of industrial construction.
    The two conferences tentatively determined that the proven petroleum reserves available for mining design across the country this year will increase by more than five times compared to the proven reserves last year; the natural gas reserves will increase by 1.5 times compared to what was already known last year. In line with this task, this year's footage of petroleum drilling will also increase by more than 1 times compared to last year. In terms of geological prospecting, the number of petroleum prospecting teams dispatched by the Ministry of Geology alone will increase from 5 last year to 13 this year. In addition to continuing to look for more oil-bearing structures in Qaidam, Junggar, and other areas where prospecting has already begun, these prospecting teams also plan to open up new petroleum prospecting areas in Xinjiang, Tibet, and other regions. The area of prospecting will increase from more than 70,000 square kilometers last year to more than 250,000 square kilometers.
    The two conferences also determined that new technologies must be widely adopted in exploration work this year, scientific research work must be strengthened, and a comprehensive plan for exploration work in various regions must be formulated. The conference determined that the two ministries will continue to expand various existing geophysical exploration teams to fully utilize the role of this advanced exploration method, and prepare to increase aerial surveys and aeromagnetic surveys to speed up the exploration work. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry also summarized 12 effective advanced experiences from last year and prepared to promote them in all exploration teams.

    今年全国石油资源勘查规模巨大
    地质部、石油工业部最近分别召开的全国石油普查和勘探会议上，决定今年在全国开展更大规模的石油资源勘查工作，以便迅速地找出大量油田满足工业建设的需要。
    这两个会议初步确定，今年全国需要探明可供开采设计的石油储量，将比去年探明的储量增加5倍多；天然气的储量要比去年已经知道的增加1.5倍。同这个任务相适应，今年石油钻井的进尺，也将比去年增加1倍以上。在地质普查方面，今年只是地质部派出的石油普查大队，就从去年的5个增加到13个。这些普查队除了在已经开始普查的柴达木、准噶尔等地继续寻找更多的储油构造以外，还准备在新疆、西藏等地区开辟新的石油普查区。普查的面积将从去年的7万多平方公里增加到25万平方公里以上。
    这两个会议还确定，今年在勘探工作中必须广泛采用新技术，加强科学研究工作，并且作出各个地区勘查工作的全面规划。会上确定这两个部将继续扩大各种已有的地球物理勘探队，充分发挥这一先进勘探方法的作用，并且准备增加航空测量和航空磁测，以加快勘查工作的速度。石油工业部还总结了12种去年行之有效的先进经验，准备在所有的勘查队中推广。
