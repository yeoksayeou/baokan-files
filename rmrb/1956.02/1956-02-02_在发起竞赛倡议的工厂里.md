In the Factory Initiating the Competition Initiative
By our reporter Su Lan

In the upsurge of socialist construction, industrial production is accelerating its pace forward. The inter-factory labor competition launched by the working class has become a driving force for promoting production. Recently, I visited several factories in the capital that first proposed inter-factory labor competition initiatives to the whole country. They are: Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant, and State-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory.

In these factories, I saw that the socialist competition launched to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule has greater breadth and consciousness. Here, every link in the production chain is activated. Same-trade competitions are organized systematically. Competitions between work procedures, between individuals; business competitions between technicians, after one challenge after another, one response after another, continuously enter the battle. The labor enthusiasm of the workers and staff is like a spring tide, spreading to every corner.

Running Ahead of Time

The workers of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant are breaking targets every day. They have already run ahead of time.

Doing so is not an easy task.

Originally, the production situation of a certain blast furnace has not been smooth since the second half of last year, the production increase plan could not be completed, and costs were overspent. Since this factory proposed the inter-factory competition initiative to the whole country, many workers said, "If the problem of this blast furnace is not solved, our initiative will be a waste of time." These words were a stimulus and encouragement to the workers of the blast furnace. They proposed to guarantee a change in the blast furnace's production situation, and at the same time, they asked the leadership to strive to name it "Youth Blast Furnace" in the first quarter. They studied that if they wanted to increase production, they had to increase the wind temperature of the hot blast stove. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the workers believed that the wind temperature of this blast furnace had reached a "saturation point" and could no longer be increased.

However, at a same-trade meeting, after repeated research, it was decided to try the Soviet advanced experience of rapid combustion. It was decided to shorten the ventilation time, strengthen the shift connection system, and unify operations. As a result of the trial, the wind temperature was increased by 10 degrees on the same day. Ten days passed, and the wind temperature rose day by day, increasing by more than 40 degrees. From the 1st to the 25th, 432 tons more pig iron was produced for the country. It was named "Youth Blast Furnace" ahead of schedule.

The problem of one blast furnace was solved, and the entire ironmaking department was breaking the 1957 production targets.

The competition movement is closely linked to one another. If the blast furnace wants to overproduce, it requires high-quality coke and limestone. Coking workers improved the old coking furnace equipment, reducing the coke powder rate to below 5%. By January 15, coke production had exceeded 376 tons. Quarry workers braved the severe cold between towering mountains to mine high-quality limestone.

Breaking Quotas

From January this year, Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant began to implement new quotas. The quota stipulates that the average working hours should be shortened by 30% compared with last year. Without breaking through this barrier, it would be impossible for the entire plant to complete the Five-Year Plan 15 months ahead of schedule.

The socialist competition of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has become a competition to break through new quotas. The youth shock brigade is in the lead. They pushed the plant-wide competition to a climax.

Subsequently, records of breaking new quotas appeared one after another. Many moving examples appeared in the processing workshop shaft section. On the universal milling machine, Wang Huitai and Ci Wenwei produced 326 main shafts, breaking the highest record. They did 48 pieces of work, reducing working hours by 11 hours and ensuring quality. The outer circle of the 3013 main shaft processed by the 610 large cylindrical grinder was 10 hours for processing 1 piece according to the new quota. Worker Li Shuyun only spent 4 hours to complete 11 pieces of work.

Now, 160 workers in the processing workshop have guaranteed to break the new quotas. Youth boring worker and labor model Li Yongyi told me: A few days ago, he and 8 other workers proposed to complete one and a half year's work this year. And strive to break the new quota by more than 28%.

Increasing Double-Share Plows for Farmer Brothers

On January 13, I went to the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant.

I heard from the chairman of the trade union that they had recently held several symposiums with representatives of nearby farmers. He also attended the ceremony of establishing advanced cooperatives in 5 villages. The workers brought back the farmers' expectations: "Supply more and better double-share plows."

The upsurge of agricultural cooperativization is inspiring the workers' labor enthusiasm. At the workers' congress that proposed the inter-factory competition to the whole country, the workers proposed to increase the production of 6,000 double-wheel double-share plows. The general assembly group of the double-share plow workshop first challenged the entire factory. Guarantee to learn the advanced experience of brother factories and improve the quality and output of products. The conditions for each workshop to respond to the challenge are to supply qualified parts to the general assembly group.

The workers showed their due perseverance and decisiveness. Last year, the scrap rate of the plowshare group in the foundry workshop averaged more than 28%. Since the competition initiative was proposed to the whole country, each workshop has proposed conditions to assist the plowshare group in improving quality. The plowshare group actively used the experience of the Kaifeng Farm Tool Factory, reducing the scrap rate to about 2%. From here, the workers understood the spirit of advanced helping the backward and humbly learning from brother factories.

Since the launch of the labor competition, labor productivity has been continuously improved. In March last year, the working hours for manufacturing a double-wheel double-share plow reached 11 hours. By the end of the year, it was shortened to 8 and a half hours. This year, the workers proposed to manufacture a double-share plow in 5 and a half hours. Therefore, production is also increasing day by day.

Quality First

Next to the Glory Stage of the State-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, female workers in white overalls were gathered, and they signed their names here, guaranteeing that no defective cloth would be produced throughout the year. "Quality First" has become the current slogan of the competition.

Improving quality requires solving many key problems. In the past, when the automatic shuttle was changed, a double weft would appear every time a shuttle was changed. Now, the workers actively proposed to reduce the requirements for defective double weft cloth. Yang Linhai, the deputy foreman of the weaving workshop, proposed to establish a statistical table on each machine to strengthen the inspection and repair of shuttles and machines based on statistics. Subsequently, the workers used the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and installed weft-detecting needles on each machine. Now, defective double weft cloth has been basically eliminated.

The carding section of the steel wire, drawing, and roving workshops proposed a guarantee of three fast and one correct (needle cloth fast, burr roller to be sharpened quickly, cover plate to be sharpened quickly, the spacing of each aspect should be correct) in the competition. The impurities in cotton yarn have been greatly reduced. The sizing workshop improved the sizing method. Originally, they used glass slurry for sizing, and each bag of flour only sized 130 pieces; now they use caustic soda slurry, and each bag of flour can size 150 pieces.

1956 has just begun, and the workers' new labor competition has just begun. In the new year, greater achievements await them. (Attached picture)

    在发起竞赛倡议的工厂里
    本报记者　苏蓝
    在社会主义建设的高潮中，工业生产正在加速步伐前进。工人阶级开展的厂际劳动竞赛，已经成为推动生产的动力。最近，我访问了首都几个首先向全国提出厂际劳动竞赛倡议的工厂。它们是：石景山钢铁厂、北京第一机床厂、北京农业机械厂和国营北京第一棉纺织厂。
    在这些工厂里，我看到，为提前完成五年计划而开展的社会主义竞赛，具有更大的广泛性和自觉性。在这里，生产链条中的每一个环节都活动起来了。同工种竞赛组织得有条有理。工序和工序之间的竞赛、个人和个人之间的竞赛；技术人员之间的同业务竞赛，经过一次再一次的挑战、应战，连续地投入战斗。职工们的劳动热情如同春潮泛滥，扩展到各个角落。
    跑在时间的前面
    北京石景山钢铁厂的工人们，天天突破指标。他们已经跑到了时间的前面。
    这样做，不是件容易事情。
    原来某号炼铁高炉从去年下半年，生产情况一直不顺心，增产计划完不成，成本又超支。自从这个厂向全国提出厂际竞赛倡议后，许多工人都说：“如果这个高炉的问题不解决，咱们的倡议非放了空炮不成”。这些话，对某号高炉的工人们是刺激，也是鼓舞。他们提出保证改变高炉生产情况，同时向领导上提出争取第一季度命名为“青年高炉”的请求。他们研究要想提高产量，非提高热风炉的风温不可。自从去年第四季度以来，工人们认为这个高炉的风温已达到了“饱和点”，不能再提高了。
    可是，在一次同工种会议上，经过反复的研究，决定试用苏联快速燃烧的先进经验。决定缩短通风时间，加强回班联系制度，统一操作。试用结果，当天就使风温提高了10度。10天过去了，风温在一天天上升，又提高了40多度。从1日到25日，为国家多生产432吨生铁。被提前命名为“青年高炉”。
    一个高炉的问题解决了，整个炼铁部都在突破1957年的生产指标。
    竞赛运动一个环节紧扣一个环节。高炉要超产，就要求有质量良好的焦炭和石灰石，炼焦工人改进了陈旧的焦炉设备，使焦沫率降低到5％以下。到1月15日，焦炭已经超产376吨。采石工人在重山峻岭之间，冒着严寒，开采优质的石灰石。
    突破定额
    从今年1月起，北京第一机床厂开始实行新定额。定额规定平均工时较去年缩短30％。不突破这一关，要想全厂提前15个月完成五年计划是不可能的。
    第一机床厂的社会主义竞赛成为突破新定额的竞赛。走在前面的是青年突击队。他们把全厂竞赛推向高潮。
    接着，突破新定额的纪录一个接着一个出现。加工车间轴段出现了许多动人的事例。在万能铣床上，汪惠泰、慈文尉生产的326主轴，突破了最高纪录。他们做48件活，竟压缩工时11小时，而且保证了质量。610大元磨床加工的3013主轴外圆，按照新定额是10小时加工1件，工人李淑云只用了4小时就做完了11件活。
    现在，加工车间已经有160名工人保证突破新定额。青年搪工、劳动模范李勇义告诉我：前几天，他和其他8名工人提出要在今年完成一年半工作量。并且争取突破新定额28％以上。
    给农民兄弟增产双铧犁
    1月13日，我去北京农业机械厂。
    听工会主席说，最近他们和附近的农民代表举行了几次座谈会。又到5个村参加了建立高级社的典礼。工人们带回了农民的期望：“供给更多更好的双铧犁”。
    农业合作化的高涨，鼓舞着工人的劳动热情。在向全国提出厂际竞赛的职工代表大会上，工人们提出再增产6，000部双轮双铧犁。双铧犁车间总装组首先向全厂提出挑战。保证学习兄弟厂的先进经验，提高产品的质量和产量。各车间的应战条件是供应总装组合格的零件。
    工人们表现出应有的毅力和果敢。去年，铸工车间犁镜组的废品率平均达到28％以上。自从向全国提出竞赛倡议以后，各车间都提出了协助犁镜组搞好质量的条件。犁镜组主动地运用了开封农具厂的经验，使废品率下降到2％左右。从这里，工人们领会了先进帮助落后、虚心向兄弟厂学习的精神。
    自从开展劳动竞赛以来，劳动生产率不断提高。去年3月，制造一部双轮双铧犁的工时达11小时，到了年底，就缩短到8小时半了。今年，工人提出以5小时半的时间制造出一部双铧犁来。因而产量也在天天增加。
    质量第一
    国营北京第一棉纺织厂的光荣台旁，围着穿白色工作服的女工，她们争先在这里签上名字，保证全年不出次布。“质量第一”已经成为目前竞赛的口号。
    提高质量，需要解决许多关键问题。过去，在自动换梭的时候，每换一个梭子就要出现一条双纬。而现在，工人们主动提出减少双纬次布的要求。织布车间副工长杨林海提出在每台车上建立统计表的建议，根据统计，加强对梭子和机器的检修。随后，工人又运用了苏联的先进经验，在每台车上都安装了探纬针。现在，双纬次布已经基本消灭了。
    钢丝、并条、粗纱车间梳棉工段在竞赛中提出了三快一正（针布快、刺毛辊要磨快、盖板要磨快，各个方面的隔距要作正）的保证。使棉纱的杂质大大减少了。浆纱车间改进了浆纱方法。原来，他们使用玻璃浆浆纱，每袋面粉只浆130匹；现在改用烧碱浆，每袋面粉浆到了150匹。
    1956年刚刚开始，工人们新的劳动竞赛刚刚开始。在新的一年中，更大的成就在等待着他们。（附图片）
