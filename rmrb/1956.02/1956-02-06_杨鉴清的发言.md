Chairman, esteemed committee members, and comrades:

I am deeply moved and overjoyed to be invited to attend the CPPCC meeting and to have met our most beloved leader Chairman Mao and the leading comrades of the Central Committee on the first day of the conference. If it were not for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao who liberated the whole country and also liberated women, how could a family member of an industrialist and businessman like me have the right to participate in such a meeting to discuss national affairs? I deeply realize the glory and happiness of women after their emancipation.

I listened to Premier Zhou's political report. The report analyzed in detail the international and domestic situations, and pointed out the direction for us to accelerate socialist construction, which greatly broadened the horizons of a woman like me who lived in a narrow family world. I further understood the trend of the world and clarified the future of the country and the individual. I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report.

Before liberation, we family members of industrialists and businessmen never cared about politics. After liberation, we saw new people and new things in society. Some sisters, under the leadership and organization of the Women's Federation, participated in study and made some progress in their thinking, and also participated in some political activities. With the advent of the high tide of the national socialist revolution, a high tide of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce was set off in large and medium-sized cities. We family members of industrialists and businessmen were also inspired and influenced by Chairman Mao's teachings and the driving force of society. Under the organization and help of the Democratic Women's Federation, most sisters devoted themselves to this great movement. In the past, some sisters expressed dissatisfaction because their husbands were busy with meetings and studies outside, asking their husbands "How much money can you earn from meetings and studies?" They held their husbands back and affected their progress. In this upsurge, on the contrary, they encouraged their husbands to actively apply for joint ventures. Some invested their private savings in enterprises to increase capital; some held family meetings to eliminate unnecessary doubts in the family; some made family plans and arranged housework so that their husbands could work with peace of mind. Many sisters also participated in the publicity and education work of the joint state-private ownership transformation, playing a leading role in promoting the movement among the broad masses of family members. Many sisters, who had never stepped out of their homes, also lined up to speak enthusiastically at the general assembly to express their gratitude to Chairman Mao. During the celebration parade, even a 60-year-old woman danced the Yangko and stepped onto the stage for the first time in her life to perform a living newspaper. In a word, we family members of industrialists and businessmen entered socialist society with joy. This is because Chairman Mao taught us to understand the laws of social development, and we began to control our own destiny.

Now that the enterprises are under joint state-private ownership, further reform and transformation are needed to improve production, and personal transformation is even more important. There are millions of us family members, which is not a small number. In the past, most of us lived dependent lives, and the bad habits and bad ideas left over from the old society are very strong. We need to work, study, and train ourselves to transform ourselves. Especially like me, I am used to living in comfort, eating and using things extravagantly, and I like vanity. I have no concept of labor, and I have not thought that my luxurious life is built on the painful lives of the broad masses of the people. This is not worthy of a new Chinese person who wants to take the socialist road. Only by studying hard and improving ourselves can we, the broad masses of family members of industrialists and businessmen, help, supervise, and promote each other in the family, and become a driving force in the cause of socialist transformation, rather than a hindrance.

We family members of industrialists and businessmen are also part of the new Chinese people, and we must make beneficial contributions to the great socialist construction of the motherland. We realize that the family is a necessary part of the social organization, not a small world for a few people. Therefore, we must overcome old ideas and old habits, gradually change our lifestyles, manage our households well, encourage our husbands, educate our children, and strive to unite more sisters to jointly accelerate our transformation.

In the process of the country's accelerated construction of socialist society, more intellectuals are needed to participate in the work. Many sisters in our families have a certain level of education, some have specialized skills, and some are senior intellectuals. However, in the old society, these sisters were buried by the reactionary rule. Even those who participated in the work were treated as "vases." The system of the old society oppressed, bullied, and destroyed people. Now, in the liberated new society, I think this part of the force is willing and able to contribute to the people. Our women have been liberated, but only the complete victory of the socialist cause can we women achieve complete liberation. We family members of industrialists and businessmen must work together with our brothers and sisters across the country to strive for the cause of socialist construction.

When our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction are advancing by leaps and bounds, and when our beloved motherland will become a modernized, highly cultured, prosperous, and strong socialist industrial power, we cannot help but miss and regret that some family members of industrialists and businessmen were influenced by the rumors of the reactionary groups before liberation and ran to Taiwan or overseas, living a painful life. We hope that they can see the bright future of the motherland, carry forward their patriotic enthusiasm, eliminate unnecessary concerns, actively encourage their husbands, return to the embrace of the motherland, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will all work together to liberate Taiwan and build a prosperous, happy, and strong socialist society.

I wish the conference a complete success.

    杨鉴清的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这次我被邀列席政协会议，而且在大会的第一天，见到了我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席和中央各位负责首长，真是无法来形容我心中的感动和喜悦。如果不是中国共产党和毛主席解放了全国，也解放了妇女，像我这样一个工商界的家属，那会有这样的权利，能够参加这样的会议来讨论国家大事呢？我深深体会到妇女翻身后的光荣和幸福。
    我听了周总理的政治报告。报告中详细分析了国际国内的形势，指出了我们加速进行社会主义建设的方针，使我在一个狭隘的家庭小天地中间过生活的妇女，大大地放开了眼界，进一步看清了世界大势的趋向，更明确了国家的前途和个人的前途，我衷心拥护周总理的报告。
    解放以前，我们工商界家属从来不问政治。解放后看到了社会的新人新事，部分姊妹们在妇联领导组织下，参加了学习，在思想上有若干进步，也参加了一些政治活动。全国社会主义革命的高潮到来，在大中城市都掀起了资本主义工商业社会主义改造的高潮中间，我们工商界家属也受到了毛主席的教导和感召及社会力量的推动。在民主妇联的组织和帮助下，大多数姊妹们都投入在这个伟大的运动中。像过去有的姊妹因为丈夫在外面开会学习，比较忙碌，表示不满，问丈夫“开会学习，有多少进帐”？这样拉丈夫后腿，影响丈夫进步的，在这次高潮中，相反的，鼓励丈夫积极申请合营。有的把自己的私蓄投入企业增资；有的开好家庭会议，消除家庭中不必要的疑虑；有的订好家庭计划，安排好家务，使丈夫安心工作。很多姊妹还参加了全业合营的宣传教育工作，在广大的家属中间起了带头推动作用，很多姊妹们从来足不出户的，在开大会的时候，也排队争先发言，来表示感谢毛主席的热情。庆祝游行的时候，连60岁的老太太也扭起秧歌舞，还生平第一天踏上了舞台，表演活报。这些数不尽的例子，一句话，我们工商界家属姊妹们都是欢天喜地的进入了社会主义社会。这是由于毛主席教导了我们要认识社会发展的规律，我们开始掌握了自己的命运。
    现在企业已经是公私合营了，还需要进一步的改革改造，来搞好生产，而个人改造，更是重要。我们家属人数有几百万，不能算少，过去大多数过着依附生活，旧社会遗留下来的坏习惯坏思想非常浓厚，更需要在工作中，学习中，锻炼自己，改造自己。尤其像我，平日养尊处优，吃惯、用惯，爱好虚荣，毫无劳动观点，没有想到自己的奢侈生活是建筑在广大人民的痛苦生活上的，这是与作为要走社会主义道路的一个新中国人民不相称的。我们广大工商界家属也只有努力学习，提高自己，才能在家庭中相互帮助，相互督促，相互推动，成为社会主义改造事业中的助力，而不是阻力。
    我们工商界家属也是新中国人民的一部分，一定要在祖国伟大的社会主义建设中作出有益的贡献。我们认识到家庭是社会组织中间的必要部分，不是几个人的小天地，因此我们一定要克服旧思想，旧习惯，逐步改变生活方式，搞好家务，鼓励丈夫，教育子女，争取更多的姊妹们团结在一起，来共同加速我们的改造。
    在国家加速建设社会主义社会中间，需要更多的知识分子来参加工作。我们家属中很多姊妹有一定的文化程度，有的有专门技术，有的还是高级知识分子。但是，在旧社会中间，这些姊妹们被反动统治埋没了，就是参加了工作的，也给人家当作“花瓶”。旧社会的制度，就是这样压迫人，欺侮人，毁灭了人。现在，在解放了的新社会中间，我想这一部分的力量是愿意、也是可能贡献给人民的。我们妇女已经解放了，但是只有社会主义事业的彻底胜利，我们妇女才能得到彻底的解放，我们工商业者家属一定和全国兄弟姊妹们一起为社会主义建设事业而共同奋斗。
    当我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设正在飞跃前进的时候，当我们可爱的祖国将成为一个现代化的、有高度文化的、富强的社会主义工业大国的时候，我们不能不怀念和惋惜着有些工商界家属姊妹们，在解放前受到反动集团的造谣影响，跑到台湾或是海外，过着痛苦的生活。我们希望他们能够看清祖国光明的前途，发扬爱国热忱，消除不必要的顾虑，积极鼓励丈夫，重返祖国的怀抱，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们大家一起，为解放台湾，建设繁荣、幸福、富强的社会主义社会而努力。
    敬祝大会胜利成功。
