Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 2nd: A spokesperson for the Japanese Communist Party announced at a press conference on February 1st that the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party held a meeting on January 28th and 29th. The meeting decided to launch a nationwide national movement to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union.

    Prior to this, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a letter to all party members and the people on January 21st entitled "Striving for the Restoration of Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations." In this letter to all party members and the people, the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that the success or failure of the ongoing Japan-Soviet negotiations in London is of great importance to the future of Japan and the vital interests of the Japanese people. However, the Hatoyama Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party are still adhering to conditions that prevent the smooth conclusion of the Japan-Soviet negotiations, such as first resolving the territorial issue and immediately returning detained war criminals to their country. The Japanese Communist Party then criticized the Hatoyama government for pursuing a policy of assisting the United States in reviving Japanese militarism.

    The Japanese Communist Party then pointed out that just as the Geneva spirit demanding the relaxation of international tensions has become world opinion, the Hatoyama Cabinet's foreign policy of dependence on the United States will increasingly deepen Japan's isolation in the international arena. The policy of the United States and Japanese reactionary forces to undermine the Japan-Soviet negotiations is contrary to the interests of the Japanese nation.

    The Japanese Communist Party finally called on all Japanese people who love their motherland and love peace to unite, smash the sabotage policies of the US-Japan reactionary forces, and strive for the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union.

    日共号召争取恢复日苏邦交
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本共产党发言人1日在记者招待会上宣布，日本共产党中央委员会曾在1月28、29两天举行会议。会议决定展开一个全国性的国民运动，来争取恢复日本同苏联的邦交。
    在这以前，日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会在1月21日发表了题为“争取恢复日苏邦交”的告全体党员和人民书。日本共产党在这个告全体党员和人民书中指出，目前在伦敦举行的日苏谈判的成败对日本的将来和对日本人民的切身利益都有非常大的关系。但是，鸠山内阁和自由民主党到现在还在坚持所谓首先解决领土问题和立即使被拘留的战犯回国等使日苏谈判不能顺利达成协议的条件。日本共产党接着指责鸠山政府推行协助美国复活日本军国主义的政策。
    日本共产党接着指出，正当要求缓和国际紧张局势的日内瓦精神已经变成世界舆论的时候，鸠山内阁的依附美国的外交政策将会日益加深日本在国际上的孤立状态。美国和日本反动势力企图破坏日苏谈判的政策，是违反日本民族利益的。
    日本共产党最后号召所有爱祖国、爱和平的日本人民团结起来，粉碎美日反动势力的破坏政策，争取恢复日本和苏联的正常邦交。
