    Timely Adoption of a Large Number of Rationalization Proposals
    Workers at the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory submitted more than 18,400 rationalization proposals in two days, from the 23rd to the 24th. Because the administrative leadership of the factory immediately took effective measures to promptly review these proposals, 7,628 had already been adopted and implemented by 3:00 PM on the 25th. As a result, 18 workshops have broken through quality targets in recent days.
