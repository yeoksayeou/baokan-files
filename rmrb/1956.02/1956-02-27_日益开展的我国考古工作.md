The increasingly developing archaeological work in China
Xia Nai, Deputy Director of the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Archaeology is a branch of historical science. It is neither playing with antiques nor engaging in textual research, but using the relics and remains left over from the past to study the history of ancient human life. Our motherland has a long history. Not only are there very rich historical sites preserved on the ground, but also many things are preserved underground, waiting for us to discover and study. These ruins of ancient cities and villages buried underground, as well as ancient tombs, preserve for us the tools of labor and daily necessities used by the ancients. Archaeologists excavate them and study them, so that they can gradually know more clearly the history of the development of productivity and social systems in ancient China, and know the achievements of the ancient working people of our country.

These ancient relics have the same importance as written records in terms of historical value. The history of our country with written records handed down from the time is only more than 3,000 years, even if the legendary era is included, it is only more than 4,000 years. However, the traces left by the activities of our ancestors can be traced back to the Peking Man era 500,000 years ago. The history of this long ancient era completely relies on archaeology for research. Even in the historical stage with written records, the places that are omitted or distorted by written records also rely on archaeological materials to supplement or correct them. The older the age, the more archaeology is needed. Material historical materials and written records are like two wheels of a car for the study of historical science, mutually confirming and cooperating. As for the minority areas in China, some still do not have writing to this day. Their ancient history will depend on archaeological research to restore.

Our motherland not only has very rich archaeological data, but also has a good tradition in archaeological research. In the Northern Song Dynasty, there was a prototype of archaeology - epigraphy. However, before liberation, archaeological work was not valued. For decades, imperialist invaders organized so-called "archaeological survey teams" to plunder our antiquities. The things obtained from the excavation became their property and were carried away. Many things found on the land of landlords were also privately owned by the landlords. Antiquities became commodities for sale, and many historical sites were destroyed, causing irreparable losses.

The People's Government, in contrast to the reactionary governments in history, regards all above-ground and underground historical sites as the property of the whole people and protects them. The Ministry of Culture established the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences established the Institute of Archaeology, to engage in the protection and research of ancient cultural relics, respectively. Four training courses for archaeological personnel were also held to train cultural relics cadres in various regions, so that they could receive special training in field archaeology. After returning to their original posts, they all participated in the archaeological survey and excavation work carried out in various regions in coordination with basic construction. The Department of History of Peking University set up an archaeology specialty to train specialized talents for archaeological work. In just six years, China's archaeological work has achieved great achievements, far exceeding the total of the past few decades. In the past six years, in addition to continuing to excavate the Peking Man discovery site in Zhoukoudian, we have also discovered Paleolithic human fossils in Dingcun, Xiangfen, Shanxi, Huangshanxi, Ziyang, Sichuan, and Qilinshan, Laibin, Guangxi. More than 2,000 pieces of chipped stone tools were also excavated at the Dingcun site. These discoveries prove that the scope of human activity in the Paleolithic Age was not limited to Zhoukoudian and the Hetao area, and the study of human fossils provides new evidence for Engels' theory of the transition from ape to man. We have newly discovered more than 300 Neolithic sites, widely distributed throughout the country, from Jilin in the east to Xinjiang in the west, Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan Island in the south. These accumulated new materials have changed our understanding of the periodization and distribution of several cultures in the Chinese Neolithic Age. At the same time, we have improved excavation techniques and began to uncover entire Neolithic villages. For example, at the Banpo site in Xi'an, after two seasons of excavation, not only were some new types of painted pottery found, but also many ground stone axes, bone cones, bone fish hooks, pottery pots, etc. Millet, which is still the main food crop in North China today, was also found in a pottery pot. In addition, the structure of the houses at that time more than 4,000 years ago and how they were arranged into villages were clarified. These are extremely important data for our research on Chinese primitive society.

The appearance of Yin Dynasty social life has also become clearer due to the excavation of residential sites in Zhengzhou and tomb complexes in Anyang. The discovery of bone tool workshops, bronze casting workshops, and pottery kilns in the Erligang area of Zhengzhou. A large tomb with a large number of people buried alive was excavated in Wuguan Village, Anyang. Many small Yin Dynasty tombs were excavated in Dasikong Village, Anyang, Liulige, Huixian, and People's Park, Zhengzhou. These have given us a clearer understanding of the social structure and production technology of slave society. A large number of bronzes were unearthed from the Western Zhou tombs in Doumen Town, Xi'an, and the Caihou tomb in Shouzhou with the "Wu Wang Guang" mirror. Some of the inscriptions on one of the bronzes are more than 100 characters long, which are important supplementary historical materials for the history of the Zhou Dynasty. In the past, almost all of these bronzes were unearthed by盗掘, passed through the hands of antique dealers several times before being passed on to researchers. Therefore, their unearthed situation was unclear, and the coexisting artifacts were scattered, which was a great loss for scientific research. This situation has now been reversed.

We have discovered a large number of iron tools from the Warring States period. Iron casting molds from the Warring States period were discovered in Xinglong, Rehe. Iron agricultural tools from this period have also been unearthed in Huixian, Changsha, and Anshan, indicating the development of productivity at that time. The art and crafts unearthed from the tombs of the Warring States period in Huixian, Changsha, Changzhi, and Luoyang are also valuable materials in the history of Chinese art. We noticed the traces of decayed wood in the soil, so in the carriage and horse pit of the Warring States period in Liulige, Huixian, we discovered traces of 19 wooden carriages. After careful excavation and recording, the result was that their original shape could be restored. This is the most valuable data for us to study the means of transportation at that time.

As for Han tombs, the number of discoveries is even more amazing. Not a few or dozens, but often more than a hundred or hundreds of tomb complexes. This is the case in Luoyang, Anshan, Changsha, and other places. After sorting out and researching, we can often arrange their chronological order and clarify the development history of material culture in that period, as well as the changes in social and economic conditions related to it. The excavation of tombs after the Han Dynasty is often the same.

We have also begun to excavate ancient cities and villages. The Han Dynasty Henan County town in Luoyang has been excavated for two seasons. Not only have we found the city walls buried underground at that time, but also excavated houses, granaries, wells, roads, and a large number of Han Dynasty relics. The excavation of the Western Han village site in Sandaohao, Liaoyang, cleared a total of 6 houses, 11 wells, 7 kiln sites, and 2 sections of paved stone roads. More than 100,000 artifacts have been unearthed. Although most of these relics are broken pottery pieces and other broken utensils, combined with the ruins, we can know the rural life, farming technology, and brick-burning handicraft industry at that time. Although residential sites are not as easy to unearth art treasures as tombs, they can provide information about the living conditions of ordinary people.

Regarding the works of art of the Han Dynasty and later dynasties, they are often discovered in archaeological excavations after liberation. I would like to briefly mention them here. Now I will only briefly talk about the archaeological work in ethnic minority areas. In 1953, an archaeological survey team was organized to conduct surveys in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. There is a new understanding of the distribution and current preservation of historical sites in the area. Many sites of the microlithic culture have been newly discovered in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. A group of ancient tombs with "Ordos" style bronzes and Western Han Dynasty bronze mirrors unearthed in Erlanhugou, Suidong, may be the burial area of ​​the Huns. Neolithic remains have also been found in Panxian, Guizhou and other places. A Han tomb was excavated in Jinning, Yunnan, which may be the tomb of a female chieftain at that time. In addition to a bronze statue of a female chieftain sitting, the funerary objects also include two Western Han Dynasty bronze mirrors, several bronze drums, and some small bronze statues engaged in weaving and other productive activities. These are valuable historical materials for studying the ancient history of ethnic minorities.

In 1954, a national exhibition of cultural relics unearthed during basic construction projects was held in Beijing, and 170,000 people visited it. It gave the audience a profound patriotic education, because these precious antiquities were all creations of the hard work of our ancestors. After everyone watched it, they all thought that Chinese archaeology has been completely changed because of the work in the past 6 years. We can almost say that the future international level of the "Chinese Archaeology" department in archaeology will be based on the level reached by our country as the standard.

Then, can it be said that China's archaeology has reached or is close to the international level? No, I don't think it can be said that yet. The quality of our excavation work is uneven, and most of the work is still very poor. The indoor sorting work not only cannot keep up with the excavation work in terms of quantity, but also the quality is not high. The scientific nature of our work itself is still not strong enough, and we have not yet made full use of various methods of natural science to assist our research. Our theoretical level is relatively poor, and our mastery of Marxism-Leninism is not enough. We have not yet established a relatively complete scientific system. These still require future efforts. We must "comprehensively plan and strengthen leadership" to give these efforts a certain direction and steps, so as to catch up with the world's scientific level within 12 years.

    日益开展的我国考古工作
    中国科学院考古研究所副所长　夏鼐
    考古学是历史科学的一部门。它既不是玩古董，也不是搞文字考据，而是利用过去遗留下来的遗迹和遗物来研究古代人类生活的历史。我们祖国具有悠久的历史，不仅地面上保留有非常丰富的古迹，在地面下也保留有很多的东西，等待我们去发现和研究。这些埋藏在地下的古代城市和村落的废墟，以及古代的墓葬，替我们保存了古人所用的劳动工具和生活用品等。考古学家发掘了它们而加以研究，便可以逐渐更清楚地知道我国古代的生产力和社会制度的发展史，知道我国古代劳动人民的成就。
    这些古代留下来的实物，在史料价值上和文字记载具有同样重要性。我国有当时文字记载传下来的历史，不过3，000多年，便是将传说时代都算进去，也不过4，000多年。而我国人民祖先活动所留下的痕迹，却可以追溯到50万年前的北京猿人时代。这绵长的远古时代的历史，完全要依靠考古学来研究。就是已有文字记载的历史阶段中，文字记录所遗漏掉的或歪曲了的地方，也依赖考古学的材料来补充或纠正。年代越古老，需要考古学的地方也越多。实物史料和文字记载，对于历史科学的研究，犹如车之两轮，互相印证，协力合作。至于国内少数民族地区，有些到现今还没有文字。他们的古代历史，将依赖考古学的研究来恢复。
    我们祖国不仅有非常丰富的考古学资料，而且对于考古学的研究，也具有优良的传统。在北宋时代，便有了考古学的雏形——金石学。但是，在解放以前，考古学的工作是不受重视的。数十年来，帝国主义侵略者组织了所谓“考古调查队”来掠夺我们的古物。发掘所得的东西便成为他们所有，捆载而去。许多在地主的土地上所发现的东西，也都属地主所私有。古物成为买卖的商品，许多古迹都被破坏了，造成不可挽救的损失。
    人民政府同历史上的反动政府相反，它把一切地面和地下的古迹都视为全民的财产，加以保护。文化部下设文物管理局，中国科学院下设考古研究所，分别从事于保护和研究古代文物的工作。又办了四届考古人员训练班，调训各地区的文物干部，使受田野考古学的特殊训练。他们回到原岗位以后，都参加了各地区为配合基本建设而进行的考古调查和发掘工作。北京大学历史系设置了考古专科，以训练考古工作的专门人材。在短短的6年中，中国考古工作取得了巨大的成就，远远超越了过去几十年的总和。6年来，我们除了继续发掘北京猿人发现地周口店以外。还在山西襄汾丁村、四川资阳黄鳝溪和广西来宾麒麟山，发现了旧石器时代的人类化石。在丁村遗址还发掘到2，000多件打制石器。这些发现证明我们旧石器时代人类的活动范围并不限于周口店和河套地区，而人类化石的研究，给恩格斯从猿到人的理论，提供了新证据。我们新发现的新石器时代遗址，达300处以上，广泛地分布于全国各处，东到吉林、西到新疆，北到内蒙古，南到海南岛，都有发现。这些累积的新材料，改变了我们对于中国新石器时代几种文化的分期和分布等的看法。同时，我们改进了发掘的技术，开始从事于揭开整个的新石器时代村落的工作。例如西安半坡遗址，经过两季的发掘，不仅发现了一些新型的彩陶器，许多磨制石斧、骨锥、骨鱼钩、陶罐等，还在一个陶罐中发现了现今仍为华北主要粮食的小米。又搞清楚了4，000多年前的当时房屋的结构和它们如何布置成为村落。这些对于我们研究中国原始社会是极重要的资料。
    殷代社会生活的面貌，也由于郑州的居住遗址和安阳的墓葬群的发掘而搞得更明白了。郑州二里岗一带有殷代制骨器工场、铸铜工场和陶窑等的发现。安阳武官村发掘了一座有大批殉葬人的大墓。安阳大司空村、辉县琉璃阁和郑州人民公园发掘了许多殷代小墓。这些使我们对于奴隶社会的社会结构和生产技术，有了更明确的认识。西安斗门镇和丹徒烟墩山的西周墓、寿州的有“吴王光”鉴的蔡侯墓，都出了大批的铜器，其中有些铜器一器的铭文便在百字以上，是周代史的重要的补充史料。从前像这样的铜器，差不多都是盗掘出来，经过古董商几度转手才传到研究者的手中，因此它们出土情形不明，共存的器物分散，对于科学研究说来是个大损失。现在这种情况是扭转过来了。
    我们发现了大批战国时代的铁器。原热河兴隆有战国时代铁制铸范发现，辉县、长沙、鞍山各处也有这时的铁制农具出土，可以知道当时生产力的发展。辉县、长沙、长治、洛阳各处战国墓葬所出的美术工艺品也是中国美术史上的珍贵资料。我们注意到土中朽木的痕迹，因而在辉县琉璃阁的战国时代车马坑中，发现19辆木车的痕迹，经过仔细发掘和记录，结果可以复原它们的原形。这是我们研究当时交通工具的最宝贵的资料。
    至于汉墓，发现的数量更是惊人。不是几座或几十座，而常是百多座或几百座的墓葬群。洛阳、鞍山、长沙等地都是如此。经过整理研究，往往可以排列出它们的年代顺序，弄清楚那一时期物质文化的发展史，以及与之相关的社会经济情况的变化。汉代以后的墓葬发掘情况，也常是如此。
    我们又开始古代都市和乡村的发掘。洛阳的汉代河南县城，已经发掘了两季，不仅找清楚了已埋在地下的当时的城垣，并且掘到当时的房屋、粮仓、水井、道路，以及大批汉代遗物。辽阳三道壕西汉村落遗址的发掘，一共清理屋舍6处，水井11眼，窑址7座，铺石道路2段。出土遗物达十多万件。虽然这些遗物大部分都是破陶片和其他残器，但是和遗迹结合起来研究，可以知道当时的农村生活、农耕技术和烧砖手工业的情况。居住遗址虽不像墓葬容易出土有美术价值的珍品，但可提供一般人民生活情况的资料。
    关于汉代及汉以后各时代的美术品，在解放后的考古发掘工作中常有发现，我想在这里从略不提。现在只稍谈少数民族地区的考古工作。1953年曾组织考古调查团在新疆维吾尔自治区做过调查工作。对于该地的古迹的分布和现下保存情况，都有了新认识。内蒙古自治区新发现了细石器文化遗址多处，又在绥东二蓝虎沟发现了出土有“鄂尔多斯”式铜器和西汉晚年铜镜的古墓群，可能是匈奴人的葬区。贵州盘县等地也发现有新石器。云南晋宁发掘到一座汉墓，可能是当时一个女酋长的墓。随葬物除了一个铜制的女酋长坐像之外，还有二面西汉晚年的铜镜，几个铜鼓，以及一些从事织布等生产活动的小铜像。这些都是研究少数民族古代史的珍贵的史料。
    1954年曾在北京开了一次全国基本建设工程中出土文物展览会，群众参观的达17万人。给予观众以深刻的爱国主义教育，因为这些珍贵的古物都是我们祖先的辛勤劳动的创造品。大家看了后，都以为中国考古学因为这6年来的工作已经完全改观了。我们几乎可以说，考古学中“中国考古学”这一部门今后的国际水平，将要以我国所达到的水平作为标准了。
    那么是不是可以说，我国的考古学已达到或接近了国际水平呢？不是，我以为还不可以这样说。我们的发掘工作的质量不平衡，大部分工作还是很差。室内整理工作不但分量赶不上发掘工作，并且质量也不高。我们的工作本身科学性仍不够强，并且还未能充分利用自然科学的各种方法来辅助我们的研究。我们的理论水平较差，掌握马克思列宁主义不够，我们还没有建立起一个比较完整的科学体系来。这些都还须要今后努力。我们要“全面规划，加强领导”，使这些努力有一定方向和步骤，以便12年内迎头赶上世界科学水平。
