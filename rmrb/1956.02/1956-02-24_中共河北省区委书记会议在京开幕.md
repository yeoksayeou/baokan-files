Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd. The first CPC Hebei Provincial District Committee Secretaries Meeting opened today at the Beijing Workers' Club. Attending the meeting were over 1,200 people, including district committee secretaries, county committee secretaries, and regional committee secretaries from across the province, as well as rural work cadres. Representatives from the Beijing and Tianjin Municipal Committees and relevant departments of the CPC also participated.

This meeting is being held after the realization of complete socialist agricultural cooperation throughout Hebei Province. The meeting will primarily study how to consolidate the victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture throughout the province, how to successfully manage the province's agricultural production cooperatives, lead them to develop agricultural production, and arrange this year's agricultural production increase tasks.

At the meeting today, Lin Tie, Secretary of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, delivered a report. He called on Party organizations and members throughout the province to "comprehensively rectify agricultural cooperatives, deeply launch an agricultural production increase competition movement, complete the first Five-Year Plan's agricultural production increase plan ahead of schedule, exceeding the target, and comprehensively, and strive to gradually realize the National Agricultural Development Program." Lin Tie said, we must never be dizzy with victory, and we must never be satisfied with existing achievements; the establishment of advanced cooperatives is only the beginning of running advanced cooperatives well. The central task of rural work in Hebei in 1956 is to: comprehensively rectify agricultural production cooperatives, continuously improve the quality of the cooperatives, deeply launch an agricultural production increase competition movement, actively and systematically carry out various agricultural capital construction projects and technical reforms, and ensure that the agricultural production increase plan of the first Five-Year Plan is completed one year ahead of schedule this year, making a good start for the gradual realization of the National Agricultural Development Program.

Yan Dakai, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, gave an explanation to the conference on the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee's plan (initial draft) for implementing the National Agricultural Development Program (draft). After discussion, revision, and extensive solicitation of opinions at the meeting, this plan will be submitted to the Provincial Party Congress to be held in June of this year for discussion and adoption.

The meeting will continue for eight days. The delegates will fully exchange advanced experiences in rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives and increasing production through discussions. The meeting will also take the opportunity to hold a rich agricultural exhibition at the Soviet Exhibition Center, which will officially open on the 24th.
