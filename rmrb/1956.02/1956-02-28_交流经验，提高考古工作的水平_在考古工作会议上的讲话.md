The archaeological work conference has opened. This conference can be said to be the first archaeological work conference in Chinese history. We are all very excited and have a responsibility to make this conference a success and complete its tasks. As the name suggests, the nature of the conference is a work conference, but it is an academic work conference related to archaeological excavation.

Now I would like to explain the tasks we have planned for the conference to the assembly.

Archaeological work in China has a long history. Judging from Lü Dalin's "Archaeological Illustration" and "Xuanhe Bogu Tu" of the Northern Song Dynasty, archaeological work, as a systematic and independent field of learning, has existed for at least nearly 1,000 years. Although the scope of "Archaeological Illustration" and "Bogu Tu" was mainly limited to bronzes, they systematically investigated the patterns, forms, measurements, times, and inscriptions of bronzes, sometimes in connection with historical geography and sometimes in connection with technology. To be fair, they possessed a fairly rigorous academic system.

Compared with modern archaeology, the achievements of those ancient people are, needless to say, a great distance away; but we must remember that this was work done nearly a thousand years ago. We must be mindful of the source when we drink water, and we should not forget our ancestors.

Unfortunately, after the Northern Song Dynasty, the research on this subject not only did not develop in our country, but declined. It was not until modern times that, mainly due to the introduction of Western archaeology, the enthusiasm for the study of this subject gradually recovered.

Especially in the six years since liberation, we have done a lot of archaeological work. Large-scale basic construction throughout the country has opened up rich underground museums for us. Whether it is the prehistoric Paleolithic and Neolithic ages, or the historical Yin, Zhou, Qin, Han, Sui, Tang and later ages, a large number of relics and remains have been discovered. According to incomplete statistics, more than 200,000 important relics have been unearthed in various places, enriching and, to some extent, correcting our historical knowledge.

Due to the urgency of the need, we have also done some work on the training of archaeological workers. Here, special thanks should be given to Peking University, which has opened a "specialization in archaeology" in the Department of History, and has trained more than 40 graduates since 1953; there are currently more than 40 students studying at the school. The short-term training courses jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Peking University every year since 1952 have been held four times, training 341 working cadres. These new forces, coupled with our older generation of experts, make our archaeological workers a team of five or six hundred people.

Our comrades are learning while working, and at the same time working while learning. Our work covers a wide area, all over China. The era we are dealing with is also very long, from the Paleolithic Age to the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. We have accumulated a lot of experience in the past six years and more, and we should not belittle ourselves. It is very necessary to make a preliminary summary of these experiences. Comrades from various places gather together, exchange experiences, observe each other, conduct discussions, and learn from each other; this is absolutely beneficial to improving our academic level and improving our working methods. This is one of the main purposes of convening this academic work conference.

We have received more than 20 reports on excavation work from various places, which will be discussed at the meeting. It is hoped that the comrades will, in the spirit of "knowing everything and saying everything," exchange opinions as much as possible, learn from each other, and strive to add luster to the existing work achievements and to achieve better and more achievements in future work. We should raise the rich experiences we have gained to the level of principles and theories as much as possible.

Significant achievements have been made in both cadre training and excavation in the past six years, but these achievements should not give rise to complacency.

We have discovered an astonishing number of sites and relics, but we have done very little sorting and research work. Some excavation work has not even provided a preliminary work report. There are too many opportunities, too many relics and sites, too many problems, and too few people. In addition, the professional level of most of our comrades cannot be said to be too high, and it is difficult to cope with the large amount of work that has suddenly increased since liberation. But we must not shrink back in the face of difficulties. We must come up with all kinds of effective methods to overcome these difficulties with the greatest strength. If we don’t, we must know that difficulties will increase greatly in the current situation, and they will only increase and become greater and greater.

As everyone knows, the development of our national construction cause has shown a new situation. The movement of semi-socialist agricultural cooperation throughout the country will be basically completed within this year; in another three or four years, that is, by 1959 or 1960, we can enter the stage of full socialist cooperation. The collectivization of handicrafts and the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises are also progressing rapidly at the same speed. The early completion of the three major socialist transformations carried out by the state, namely the socialist revolution, has also promoted the process of socialist industrialization, increasing in scale and accelerating in speed.

Think about it, everyone, the result of agricultural cooperation will inevitably lead to the mechanization of agricultural production; coupled with the increasing scale and speed of industrialization, what will be the inevitable result? The inevitable result is that, as Chairman Mao said in the preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside," "The scale and speed of development of science, culture, education, and health cannot be completely done according to what was originally thought. These should be appropriately expanded and accelerated."

The CPC Central Committee recently held a meeting on the issue of intellectuals. You have all seen the historical report made by Premier Zhou Enlai. The CPC Central Committee called on intellectuals across the country to make the most intensive efforts under the principle of overall planning and strengthened leadership to strive to bring backward Chinese science and culture close to the advanced level of the world within 12 years. This is a glorious and arduous task for us, but it is a task that must and can be completed. We have the strong leadership of the Party and comprehensive planning, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. As long as we can work with the most intensive efforts, we will definitely be able to realize the Party's call to us.

From the perspective of archaeological work, we can get a more specific understanding. The large-scale basic construction in the past six years has enabled archaeological work to develop vigorously and unprecedentedly. Under the current new situation, the rapid progress of agriculture and industry, and the increasing scale and speed of transportation, water conservancy and other projects, will they not open up the inexhaustible underground museum for us more extensively and frequently? What kind of preparations should we make to meet this magnificent new situation?

The problem has been raised to us, and the answer has also been raised to us. To be competent to cope with this new situation, it is very obvious that we must expand our work team, improve our professional level, promote our political consciousness, and give full play to our potential strength. These must have comprehensive and long-term planning, and be carried out in an organized, step-by-step, and leadership-led manner to unite all forces, and then can the problem be satisfactorily solved.

Responding to the call of the Party, the relevant departments are currently concentrating their efforts to formulate a 12-year long-term plan. Our archaeological work, under the current new situation, should also have a 12-year long-term plan. How should we expand our team, improve our professional level, promote our political consciousness, and give full play to our potential strength? We hope that all comrades attending the meeting will give more consideration and provide as much advice as possible. This will be of great help in the formulation of the 12-year long-term plan. This is another main purpose of convening this academic work conference.

It cannot be denied that our archaeological team is still pitifully small. The professional level of most of our working comrades is still far from the advanced level of the world. Modern archaeology involves many and broad academic departments. It is not only closely related to many humanities sciences, but also closely related to many natural sciences and technical sciences. Especially recently, this science has also entered the atomic energy age. Using X-rays to see through the inside of statues and using isotope 014 to determine the age of antiquities have been carried out in other countries for a long time; but we ourselves have not even done many preliminary excavation, sorting, and research work to a satisfactory degree. No matter what, we must catch up with the most intensive efforts. There is no reason to allow ourselves to be complacent in the slightest.

There is also a preliminary proposal that must be explained to all comrades. That is, we hope to convene an "Archaeological Academic Conference" in a short period of time, inviting some scholars from the world to participate. We need to gain experience in this conference.

Scholars from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are extremely concerned about China's archaeological cause, and progressive scholars from other countries are also deeply concerned. This is because China's archaeological cause has profound significance for the world. There is still a large blank space in human history and world history, which urgently needs to be filled by the extremely rich underground burial in China.

Especially at present, we want to break the idealist view of history of the European and American bourgeoisie and the world history system centered on white people. The sites and relics excavated underground and the in-depth research on them are extremely effective and sharp weapons for us.

Our own efforts are our unshirkable responsibility, but we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the world, welcome progressive scholars from the world to solve problems together, and at the same time worship them as our teachers.

Comrades, this is our plan for the significance and tasks of this conference.

Please allow me to summarize it again.

Our conference is an academic work conference.

The tasks of the conference:
(1) Summarize and exchange the experience of archaeological work in the past six years and improve the level of work;
(2) Exchange views on the formulation of the 12-year long-term plan for archaeological work;

These two tasks can actually be summarized into one, that is, to respond to the call of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, adapt to the new situation of national construction, carry out comprehensive planning and strengthen leadership from the perspective of archaeological work, and strive to bring our archaeological work close to the advanced level of the world within 12 years with the most intensive efforts.

We hope that all comrades will concentrate our wisdom, make this conference a success, and enable this first archaeological work conference in history to achieve a glorious victory.

    交流经验，提高考古工作的水平
    ——在考古工作会议上的讲话——
    郭沫若
    考古工作会议开幕。这次会议可以说是中国有史以来的第一次考古工作会议。我们大家都非常振奋，有责任把这次会议开好，完成会议的任务。会议的性质，如名称所表示，是工作会议，但它是有关考古发掘的学术性的工作会议。
    现在我想把我们所预定的会议的任务向大会说明一下。
    考古工作在中国是有长远历史的。从北宋吕大临的“考古图”和“宣和博古图”看来，考古工作作为一种具有系统的独立的学问，至少已经有了将近1，000年的历史了。“考古图”和“博古图”所处理的范围虽然主要只限于青铜器，但它们对铜器的花纹、形式、度量、时代、铭文的考释都作了比较有系统的考察，有时候联系到历史地理，有时候联系到工艺技术，公平地说，是具备了一个相当严密的学术系统的。
    那些古人的业绩和近代考古学比较起来，不消说是有很大的距离；但我们要想到那是将近一千年前的工作了。我们要饮水思源，不应该数典忘祖。
    北宋以后，关于这门学问的研究在我们却不幸不仅没有发展，反而衰颓下去了。一直到了近代主要由于西方的考古学的输入，对于这门学问的研究热情又才逐渐恢复了转来。
    特别是在解放以后六年多的期间，我们是做了不少的考古工作的。在全国范围内的大规模的基本建设，把丰富的地下博物馆替我们开放了，无论是有史以前的旧石器时代和新石器时代，或者是有史以来的殷周、秦汉、隋唐及其以后的时代，都有大量的遗物遗迹发现。据不完全的统计，各地出土的重要遗物已在20万件以上，丰富了并在某种程度上端正了我们的历史知识。
    由于需要的迫切，关于考古工作者的训练，我们也做了一些工作。在这里应该特别感谢北京大学，它在历史系里面开设了“考古专门化”，从1953年以来已经训练出了40多位毕业生；目前在校学习的也还有40多位。文化部、中国科学院、北京大学自1952年以来每年合办一次的短期训练班已经举行了四次，训练出了341位工作干部。这些新生力量加上我们老一辈的专家，我们的考古工作者已经是有五六百人的一个队伍了。
    我们的同志们是一面学习一面工作，同时也是一面工作一面学习的。我们的工作面很广，遍于全中国。我们所处理的时代也很长，由旧石器时代一直到元、明、清。六年多来我们不容妄自菲薄，是积累了不少的经验的。把这些经验作一初步的总结，是很有必要的。各地的同志们聚集在一道，交流经验，彼此观摩，展开讨论，相互学习；这在提高我们的学术水平和改进我们的工作方法上，是有绝对的好处的。这层就是我们召开这次学术性的工作会议的一个主要的目的。
    我们已经收到了20多种各地的发掘工作报告，将在会上进行讨论。希望同志们本着“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神，尽量交换意见，切磋琢磨，使既得的工作成就能够在锦上添花，使今后的工作能有更好更多的成就。我们要把既得的丰富经验，最好能够提高到原则性的理论水平。
    六年多来无论在训练干部方面或进行发掘方面都有显著的成就，但这些成就丝毫也不应该引起我们自满的情绪。
    我们所发现的遗迹遗物是有惊人的数量的，然而我们的整理研究工作却做的很少，甚至有好些发掘工作，我们连初步的工作报告都还没有提供出来。机会太多、遗物、遗迹太多，问题太多，而人手却太少，再加上我们大多数同志的业务水平也还并不能说是太高，要应付解放以来突然增加的大量的工作，是有困难的。但是我们不能在困难面前畏缩，我们要想出种种有效的办法来，以最大的力量克服这些困难。假使不这样，我们要知道困难在目前的形势之下是还要大大的增加的，有加无已，而且愈来愈大。
    大家都知道，我们的国家建设事业的发展已经呈现出了一个新形势。在今年内全国范围内的半社会主义农业合作化的运动就要基本上完成；再隔三、四年，也就是说到1959年或者1960年，更可以进入到全社会主义合作化的阶段。手工业的合作化，私营工商业的社会主义改造也以同样的速度在飞跃地进展。国家所进行的三大社会主义改造工作，即社会主义革命工作的提前完成也就促进社会主义工业化的过程，在规模上日益加大，在速度上日益加快。
    各位请想想，农业合作化的结果必然导致农业生产的机械化；再加上工业化的规模加大与速度加快，这必然的结果是怎样呢？这必然的结果就是毛主席在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言中所说的“科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业的发展的规模和速度，已经不能完全按照原来所想的那个样子去做了，这些都应当适当地扩大和加快”。
    中共中央最近召开了一次关于知识分子问题的会议，周恩来总理所作的一个具有历史性的报告各位是看到了的，中共中央向全国的知识分子号召，要在全面规划、加强领导的方针之下，以最紧张的努力争取在12年内使落后的中国科学文化接近世界的先进水平。这在我们是光荣而艰巨的任务，但是是必须完成而且能够完成的任务。我们有党的坚强领导全面规划，有苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私的帮助，只要我们能以最紧张的努力进行工作，是一定能够实现党对于我们的号召的。
    从考古工作方面来说，我们可以得到更具体的了解。六年多来规模宏大的基本建设已经使考古工作得到蓬蓬勃勃的空前未有的发展，在目前的新形势之下，农业和工业的飞速进展、交通水利等工程的愈来愈大的规模，愈来愈快的速度，不是会把无尽藏的地下博物馆更加大量地更加频繁地为我们开放出来吗？我们应该作怎样的准备来迎接这个波浪壮阔的新形势呢？
    问题提到了我们的面前，答案也就提到了我们的面前。我们要想胜任地应付这个新形势，很明显地我们就必须扩大我们的工作队伍，提高我们的业务水平，促进我们的政治觉悟，发挥我们的潜在力量。这些都必须有全面的长远规划，有组织、有步骤、有领导地团结一切力量来进行，然后才能使问题得到满意的解决。
    响应着党的号召，目前有关各部门都正在集中力量来进行着12年远景计划的拟订。我们的考古工作，在目前的新形势之下，也应该有一个12年的远景计划。到底应该怎样来扩大我们的队伍，怎样来提高我们的业务水平，怎样来促进我们的政治觉悟，怎样来发挥我们的潜在力量，我们希望到会的各位同志多多考虑一下，尽量提供意见。这在12年远景计划的制定上是有很好的帮助的。这层也就是我们召开这次学术性的工作会议的又一个主要目的。
      不容讳言，我们的考古工作的队伍还是小得很可怜的。我们大多数工作同志的业务水平离世界的先进水平相隔还很远。近代考古学这门科学所涉及的学术部门很多很广，它不仅和许多人文科学有密切关联，和许多自然科学和技术科学也有密切的关联。特别到最近，这门科学也进入了原子能时代了。用爱克司射线来透视塑像内部，用同位素014来测定古物年代，在别的国度里已经早在进行了；而我们自己呢却连许多初步的发掘、整理、研究工作都还没有做到可以满意的程度。我们无论怎样，是必以最紧张的努力，急起直追的。没有任何理由，可允许自己有丝毫的骄傲自满。
    还有一项初步的拟议须得向各位同志说明一下。那就是我们希望在不长的时间内召开“考古学术会议”，邀请些世界的学者来参加。我们需要在这次会议中取得经验。
    对于中国的考古事业，苏联和人民民主国家的学者是异常关心的，同时其他国家的进步学者也有深切的关心。这是因为中国的考古事业具有世界性的深刻意义。人类史和世界史还有很大一片空白，急切需要由地下埋藏极其丰富的中国来加以补填。
    特别在目前我们要打破欧美资产阶级的唯心史观和以白种人为中心的世界史体系，地下发掘的遗址、遗物和对于它们的深入研究，在我们是极有效的犀利武器。
    我们自己的努力是责无旁贷的，但我们必须认真地学习世界先进经验，欢迎世界的进步学者来一同解决问题，同时也就是拜他们做我们的老师。
    同志们，关于这次会议的意义和任务，我们的预定就是这样。
    请允许我再概括地说一遍吧。
    我们的会议是学术性的工作会议。
    会议的任务：
      （一）总结和交流六年多来考古工作的经验，提高工作水平；
      （二）就考古工作12年远景计划的制定，交换意见；
    这两项任务事实上也可以归纳成为一项，那就是响应中共中央和毛主席的号召，适应国家建设的新形势，从考古工作方面来进行全面规划、加强领导，以最紧张的努力，争取在12年内使我们的考古工作接近世界的先进水平。
    我们希望全体同志集中我们的智慧，把这一次会议开好，使这有史以来的第一次考古工作会议能够得到辉煌的胜利。
