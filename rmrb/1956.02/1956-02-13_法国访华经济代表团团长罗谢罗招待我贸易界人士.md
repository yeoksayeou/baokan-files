We are willing to develop trade, cultural, and friendly relations with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Nan Hanchen expressed the hope that the delegation would achieve positive results in this trade negotiation in order to meet the French people's desire for Sino-French trade.

Lei Renmin also gave a speech at the banquet, pointing out that there are many varieties and large quantities of goods that can be traded between China and France, which shows that Sino-French trade has broad prospects. He hoped that Sino-French trade relations would be normalized as soon as possible.
