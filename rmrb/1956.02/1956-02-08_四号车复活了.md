    Looking Up to Advanced Producers

    Fourth Paper Machine Resurrected
    Wan Hong
    During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign of 1955, the No. 4 Fourdrinier paper machine (referred to as No. 4 Machine) of the state-owned Lihua Paper Mill resumed production after being out of operation for a long time. This transformation was the result of leadership supporting the advanced and criticizing and overcoming the backward.
    In the past, due to certain technicians overestimating objective difficulties and neglecting machine maintenance, at the end of 1954, the chief engineer believed that No. 4 Machine was "irreparably damaged" and requested that it be shelved. The factory director, without investigating, agreed to stop production. During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign of 1955, the Party organization of the pulping workshop in this factory relied on the workers and technicians to revise the economy plan four times, raising the targets each time. The branch also, based on the workers' opinions, requested the restoration of production of No. 4 Machine. However, the chief engineer opposed this request.
    The branch secretary was not discouraged by others' ridicule. He consulted those technicians with advanced ideas and visited workers who had previously worked on No. 4 Machine. They all agreed that the biggest problem with the paper produced by No. 4 Machine in the past was uneven thickness, which could be solved simply by planing the bottom plate of the cylinder mold. In the eyes of the advanced workers and technicians, the problem was so easy to solve, but the chief engineer thought it was impossible.
    After the Party organization talked to the chief engineer, the chief engineer agreed with the Party organization's opinion and decided to resume production of No. 4 Machine. However, during the preparation for resuming production, the factory director took sick leave, and the production section did not execute the chief engineer's instructions, failing to include the production of No. 4 Machine in the production plan. Consequently, the raw materials section said that the production of No. 4 Machine was outside the plan and there were no raw materials; the mechanical repair workshop also believed that the repair of No. 4 Machine was outside the plan and there was no manpower or time. The factory's Party organization used the method of supporting the advanced and criticizing and overcoming the backward to help the raw materials section and the mechanical repair workshop, enabling them to prepare raw materials for No. 4 Machine and prepare repair time and labor. In October of last year, the production of No. 4 Machine normalized. Facts have proven that it can not only produce kraft paper (original product), but also letterpress printing paper, with a qualification rate often reaching 100%.
    There is no doubt that No. 4 Machine can produce, and produce very well. However, can its output be further increased? There are also two answers to this question. The chief engineer said: To increase output, for example, to increase the machine speed from the current 24 meters per minute to 42 meters per minute, it is necessary to invest 80,000 yuan and shut down the machine for a month for reconstruction, otherwise, even if the output can be increased, the paper produced can only be sold to garbage collectors. However, the workers and technicians of No. 4 Machine have different views. They believe that the machine speed can be increased to 42 meters per minute without spending money or reconstructing. They also jointly put forward many rationalization proposals with Zhu Rong, a model worker in Shanghai, according to these proposals, with an investment of only about 10,000 yuan and a shutdown of more than ten days, the machine speed can be increased to more than 60 meters per minute. The leadership supported and adopted this opinion, criticizing the chief engineer's conservative thinking. The result is that without spending a penny and without changing the equipment, the machine speed has reached 36 meters per minute. If an investment of about 10,000 yuan is made and production is stopped for more than ten days to partially adjust the equipment, it is entirely possible to increase the machine speed to 60 meters per minute. Now, even the chief engineer says: "Without No. 4 Machine, how could we complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and above quota!"
    Because the Party organization and administrative leaders of this factory adopted the leadership method of supporting the advanced and criticizing and helping the backward in various tasks, they have also achieved remarkable results in saving raw materials, saving basic construction investment, and improving product quality. For example, by relying on advanced workers and technicians, the conditions of cooking rice straw pulp with alkaline liquor were changed, which can save 500,000 to 600,000 yuan per year; the saying that white water recycling equipment must be added to recycle white water was broken, and white water was recycled using the original pipeline, which can save 100,000 yuan; the beating conditions and operating methods were improved, and the quality problem of No. 3 Machine, which was originally considered unsolvable, was solved. Since the leadership conducted education on completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and above quota to the employees and engineering technicians, the enthusiasm of the masses has been very high. According to preliminary calculations, this year's output of this factory can exceed the national plan by 27.9%, an increase of 54% compared with the actual output in 1955. Other indicators such as labor productivity and product quality have also been correspondingly improved, and costs have been correspondingly reduced. It is estimated that the First Five-Year Plan can be completed in August this year.
    The experience of Lihua Paper Mill tells us that as long as the leaders of enterprises are not satisfied with the status quo, do not allow the advanced and the backward to coexist peacefully, do not allow the backward to live comfortably, and support the advanced at any time and place, and use the advanced to overcome the backward, and force the backward to move forward together, the production of enterprises can be continuously improved and enhanced.

    四号车复活了
    万红
    在1955年的增产节约运动中，国营利华造纸厂的四号圆网抄纸机（简称四号车）在停止生产很久以后又重新开始生产了。这个转变是领导支持先进，批判和克服落后的结果。
    过去，由于某些技术人员过分估计客观困难，不重视机器维护的结果。在1954年底，主任工程师认为四号车已经“破坏不堪”要求把它搁置起来，厂长不摸底，就同意停止生产了。在1955年增产节约运动中，这个厂的制浆车间的党组织依靠职工群众和技术人员，修改了四次节约计划，指标一次比一次提高。支部还根据工人的意见，要求恢复四号车的生产。但是，主任工程师反对这个要求。
    支部书记并不因为别人的讥笑而灰心。他去请教那些具有先进思想的技术人员，访问以前在四号车上工作的工人。他们一致认为：过去四号车抄出来的纸最大的毛病是厚薄不匀，而这只要把圆网箱底板铲一铲就行了。在先进的职工群众和技术人员看来，问题是这样容易解决，而主任工程师却认为毫无办法。
    党组织派人跟主任工程师谈话后，主任工程师同意了党组织的意见，决定恢复四号车的生产。但是，在准备恢复生产的过程中，厂长休假养病，生产科不执行主任工程师的指示，没把四号车的生产编到生产计划里去。因而原料科说四号车的生产是计划外的生产，没有原材料；机械检修车间也认为四号车的检修是计划外的检修，没有人力和时间。工厂的党组织用支持先进，批判和克服落后的办法，帮助原料科和机械检修车间，使他们为四号车准备了原材料，为四号车准备了检修的时间和人工。去年10月间，四号车的生产正常了。事实证明：它不只生产牛皮纸（原来生产牛皮纸），而且能生产凸板印刷纸，合格率经常达到100％。
    四号车能够生产，而且生产得很不坏，这是没疑问的了。但是，它的产量能不能再提高呢？对于这个问题，也有两种答案。主任工程师说：要提高产量，比如把车速从现在的每分钟24公尺提高到42公尺，非投资8万元，停车一个月进行改建不可，否则即使能提高产量，抄出来的纸也只能卖给收垃圾的人。但是，四号车的工人们和技术人员们却有不同的看法。他们认为：不用花钱，也不用改建就可以把车速提高到42公尺。他们又同上海市劳动模范朱荣共同提出了很多合理化建议，根据这些建议，只用一万元左右的投资，停车十多天就可以把车速提高到60公尺以上。领导上支持和采纳了这种意见，批判了主任工程师的保守思想。结果是没花一元钱，没变动设备，车速已经达到了36公尺，如果花一万元左右投资，停止生产十多天来局部调整设备，把车速提高到60公尺是完全可能的。现在，连主任工程师也说：“没有四号车，我们怎能提前和超额完成第一个五年计划啊！”
    由于这个厂的党组织和行政领导，在各项工作中采取了支持先进、批判和帮助落后的领导方法，在节约原材料、节约基本建设投资、提高产品质量方面，也都取得了显著的成绩。例如，依靠先进工人和技术人员，改变了蒸煮稻草浆碱液的条件，每年可以节约50—60万元；打破了必须增添白水回收设备才能回收白水的说法，利用原有管道回收白水，可以节约10万元；改进了打浆条件和操作方法，把原来认为不可解决的三号车的质量问题解决了。自从领导上向职工和工程技术人员进行提前和超额完成五年计划的教育以后，群众的积极性非常高。根据初步计算，这个厂今年的产量可以超过国家计划27.9％，比1955年实际产量增加54％，其它如劳动生产率、产品质量等指标，也相应地提高，成本也相应地降低，预计在今年8月就可以完成第一个五年计划。
    利华造纸厂的经验告诉我们，只要企业的领导者不安于现状，不让先进的东西和落后的东西和平共处，不让落后的人心安理得地过日子，随时随地支持先进的东西，用先进的东西去克服落后的东西，迫使落后的人一同前进，就可以不断改进和提高企业的生产。
