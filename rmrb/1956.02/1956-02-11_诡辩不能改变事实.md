Sophistry Cannot Change Facts
Chen Wei

The United States' arbitrary release of large numbers of military reconnaissance balloons and propaganda balloons has aroused close attention from people of all countries and has been met with protests from many countries. However, the recent statements made by responsible figures in the U.S. government on this issue are still filled with all kinds of sophistry to defend the U.S.'s provocative balloon launches, attempting to evade responsibility.

At a press conference held on February 7, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles brazenly attempted to obliterate the sovereignty of other countries over their airspace in order to create excuses for the U.S.'s aerial invasion activities. According to him, "the question of ownership of the higher air layers is a matter of dispute," so the U.S. has the right to release balloons anywhere in the world. This is truly a very strange argument! Ridiculously, Dulles claimed at the press conference that he "used to be an international law expert," but the fact proves that he does not even possess the most basic common sense of international law.

The entire space above a country's territory is under the complete and exclusive sovereignty of that country and becomes an inseparable part of that country's territory. This has long been recognized as an accepted norm of international law. A country's aerial border, like its land and sea borders, is inviolable. A military reconnaissance balloon is a flying tool with military characteristics, and its intrusion into another country's airspace is clearly an act of violating that airspace. Dulles's nonsense cannot change the recognized principles of international law and absolve the U.S. of its guilt.

Another noteworthy excuse is that the U.S. refers to the release of reconnaissance balloons as a scientific research activity and even attempts to link it with the upcoming International Geophysical Year program. This claim cannot deceive anyone with a little common sense. Everyone knows that the International Geophysical Year is a purely scientific research activity jointly formulated by scientists from all countries. Although this broad scientific activity plan also includes the work of collecting meteorological data around the world, it has nothing in common with the U.S.'s balloon launches for military reconnaissance purposes. Moreover, the Preparatory Committee for the International Geophysical Year has already entrusted the scientific institutions of the relevant countries to be responsible for the work of collecting meteorological data separately, and has not entrusted the U.S. military authorities with any task of providing scientific materials. The reason why the U.S. repeatedly says that the release of balloons is for "scientific research purposes" is nothing more than an attempt to carry out reconnaissance activities against peaceful and democratic countries under such a disguise, the kind that had run into snags when using airplanes in the past!

Under the serious protests of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries and the condemnation of public opinion in various countries, the U.S. government has replied to the Soviet government on February 8, stating that it "will try to avoid releasing balloons again." However, the U.S. government's statement has not been seriously observed by the U.S. military authorities. The day after the U.S. government replied to the Soviet government, a United Press International dispatch from Japan said: "Just as the Communist bloc countries are protesting the release of weather balloons (?) over their countries, the U.S. Navy released its ninth weather balloon on Wednesday (February 9) evening." According to the U.S.'s pre-determined plan, more balloons will continue to be released. The matter is very clear. As long as the U.S. continues to release its balloons, the airspace of the Soviet Union, China, and other countries will continue to be at risk of being violated, and the U.S. must be responsible for the consequences of this provocative behavior.

What should be pointed out further is that the U.S., in its reply to the Soviet government's note and in the speeches of other officials, is still evading the responsibility of certain U.S. institutions for releasing propaganda balloons to the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe. According to them, it seems that the evil activities of the so-called "Radio Free Europe" and "Crusade for Freedom" are not related to the U.S. Dulles said, "They are operating outside the United States, and since these are private activities, this is not something we want to try to control." However, the facts are clearly in front of us, and it is difficult for the U.S. to deny its close relationship with these reactionary organizations.

Everyone knows that "Radio Free Europe" in Munich, West Germany, is an organization established by General Clay, the former commander of the U.S. occupation zone in West Germany, specializing in espionage activities against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. The U.S. magazine "Newsweek" reported as early as a few years ago that this radio station is "directed by Americans and technically assisted. ...Radio Free Europe's work does not duplicate that of the 'Voice of America.' It can broadcast what the 'Voice of America,' as an agency of the State Department, cannot broadcast." "Most importantly, because Radio Free Europe is a private (?) organization, it can speak freely without regard to any diplomatic repercussions and disputes." Clay himself also predicted when the organization was established in 1950, "There is no limit to what we can and will do." Over the years, whenever the U.S. ruling clique needed to intensify the Cold War and exacerbate international tensions, it would instruct this reactionary organization to carry out frenzied subversive and destructive activities against the peaceful and democratic countries of Europe, just like a master releasing hounds. Releasing balloons is one of its evil activities in recent years. Obviously, only the U.S. can stop the activities of this organization. Therefore, the U.S.'s attempt to deny its close relationship with it can only be regarded as an attempt by the U.S. to continue to provoke the people's democratic countries of Europe and interfere in their internal affairs.

Public opinion in various countries demands that the U.S. government immediately stop the action of sending balloons to any country to steal information and carry out slanderous propaganda, and stop instigating those foreign espionage agencies to carry out all evil activities that endanger peace and international cooperation.

    诡辩不能改变事实
    陈维
    美国任意施放大量军事侦察气球和宣传气球的行为，已经引起了各国人民的密切注意，并遭到了许多国家的抗议。但是美国政府负责人士最近对这个问题所发表的谈话，却还在为美国施放气球的挑衅行为进行百般辩解，企图推托责任。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在本月7日举行的记者招待会上，居然厚颜无耻地想抹杀其他国家对于本国领空的主权，以便为美国的空中侵略活动制造借口。据他说，“较高的空气层的所有权问题是一个争执的问题，”因此美国有权利在世界上任何地方施放气球。这真是非常奇怪的论据！可笑的是，杜勒斯在记者招待会上自称他“原来是一个国际法学家”，而事实证明他却连国际法的起码常识都不具备。
    一国领土上空的全部空间，都处于该国的完全和排他的主权之下，并且成为该国领土的不可分割的一部分。这一点，早已被认为是公认的国际法规范了。一个国家的空中国界，也跟它的陆上和海上国界一样，是不可侵犯的。军事侦察气球是一种带有军事性质的飞行工具，它的侵入别国上空显然是一种侵犯领空的行为。杜勒斯的信口雌黄并不能改变公认的国际法原则而开脱美国的罪责。
    值得注意的另一种借口，是美国把施放侦察气球称作为一种科学研究活动，甚至还企图把它同即将举行的国际地球物理年的计划联系起来。这种说法丝毫也不能欺骗稍有常识的人们。谁都知道，国际地球物理年是世界各国科学家所共同拟订的纯粹属于科学研究性质的活动。虽然这个广泛的科学活动计划中也包括了在世界各地收集气象材料的工作，但是它和美国以军事侦察为目的的施放气球的行动毫无共同之处。而且国际地球物理年筹备委员会早已把收集气象材料的工作交由各有关国家的科学机构分别负责进行，根本没有委托美国军事当局担当什么提供科学材料的任务。美国之所以口口声声说施放气球是为了供“科学研究用的”，不过是想在这样的掩饰之下，对和平民主国家进行那种过去使用飞机时曾经遭到碰壁的侦察活动罢了！
    在苏联、人民民主国家的严重抗议和各国舆论的谴责之下，美国政府已在2月8日复照苏联政府，表示“将设法避免再放送气球”。但是，美国政府的声明并没有得到美国军事当局的认真遵守。在美国政府复照苏联政府的下一天，美国合众社从日本发出的一条消息还这样说：“正当共产党集团国家抗议往它们的国家上空放测候气球（？）的时候，美国海军星期三（2月9日）晚上放出第九个测候气球。”而按照美国预定的计划，还有更多的气球将要继续放出。事情是很明白的。只要美国继续放送它的气球，苏联、中国和其他国家的领空就有继续被侵犯的可能，而美国也就必须对这种挑衅行为的后果负责。
    更应该指出的是，美国在答复苏联政府的照会中和其他官方人士的发言中，仍然在躲避某些美国机构对东欧人民民主国家放送宣传气球的责任。照他们说来，似乎那些所谓“自由欧洲广播台”和“自由十字军”的罪恶活动，是同美国不相干的。杜勒斯说，“他们是在美国境外进行活动的，由于这些是私人活动，这不是我们想设法加以控制的事情。”但是，事实明明摆在面前，美国要想否认它同这些反动组织的密切关系是很困难的。
    谁都知道，在西德慕尼黑的“自由欧洲广播台”，是由前西德美国占领区司令克莱将军所建立的一个专门对苏联和人民民主国家进行间谍活动的机构。美国的“新闻周刊”早在几年前就曾报道，这个电台由“美国人决定方针，并在技术上予以协助。……自由欧洲广播台的工作决不与‘美国之音’相重复。它可以广播作为国务院的机构‘美国之音’所不能广播的东西。”“最重要的一点是因为自由欧洲广播台是私人（？）组织的，所以它可以畅所欲言，无须顾及任何外交上的反响与纠纷。”而克莱本人在这个机构于1950年成立时也曾预告，“我们所能作和将要作的事是没有止境的”。几年来，每当美国统治集团需要加紧冷战和加剧国际紧张局势的时候，就像主人放出鹰犬那样地指使这个反动组织对欧洲和平民主国家进行疯狂的颠复破坏活动。施放气球就是近年来它的罪恶活动之一。显然，只有美国才能制止这个机构的活动。因此，美国要想否认自己同它的密切关系，只能被认为是美国打算继续对欧洲人民民主国家进行挑衅和干涉它们内政的企图。
    各国舆论要求美国政府立即停止向任何国家放送盗窃情报和进行诬蔑宣传的气球的行动，并且停止策动那些国外间谍机构进行一切危害和平和国际合作的罪恶活动。
