    Liquidate Departmentalism
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    Departmentalism only sees the partial interests of one's own unit, but not the overall interests of the revolutionary cause. It even goes so far as to harm the overall interests of the revolution for the sake of its own partial interests. Departmentalism is a toxin that disintegrates and corrodes the revolutionary cause. Therefore, departmentalism is absolutely incompatible with revolutionary collectivism. This kind of departmentalism has long and seriously existed in the basic construction departments of Anshan. Departmentalism here has a common name: "wrangling," which means mutual distrust, lack of support, mutual complaints, and mutual constraints. Some people think that "honest people who don't wrangle will suffer losses" and "if you are not departmental, you won't be able to complete the plan." Some people even promote "wrangling" as "advanced experience," and whoever knows how to "wrangle" is considered "talented." Therefore, some people have departmentalist ideas and do not feel ashamed, but rather proud. The fact that Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company failed to complete the state plan in the first nine months of last year, with 11 out of 13 major projects failing to meet the construction progress requirements, is inseparable from this serious departmentalism in thinking and work style.
    In October of last year, under the leadership of the responsible comrades of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Anshan Municipal Committee convened a meeting of responsible party cadres of basic construction units. The meeting made serious criticisms and self-criticisms of departmentalism and criticized by name those units with serious departmentalist work styles.
    For example, the Metal Structure Engineering Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company should have completed the crane beam project of the Dagushan Magnetic Separation Plant by the end of November 1954. However, because they felt that this project was "not profitable" and would not help them complete their workload, they delayed it repeatedly, despite dozens of resolutions on the date of completion, until March 20, 1955. As a result, the equipment installation task was delayed by 104 days.
    The meeting also commended some units that took the initiative to cooperate. For example, the Furnace Construction Engineering Company introduced an example of such initiative cooperation, due to the spirit of brotherly mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist enterprises of both parties. They treated the difficulties of others as their own and helping others as their bounden duty. The result of mutual help, concerted efforts, and close cooperation was that the construction period of the project they were responsible for was shortened from the originally planned 90 days to 58 days.
    This meeting was a tremendous ideological shock to all those who had committed departmentalist errors. It was generally believed that "this was a profound education that Anshan had not seen in several years."
    In order to implement the spirit of this meeting, the Municipal Committee immediately organized working groups to go deep into various units for inspection. The Party committees of various basic construction units also convened meetings, and the construction sites also held political work meetings to widely mobilize the broad masses of workers to inspect and oppose departmentalism.
    In this way, criticism and self-criticism were widely carried out from top to bottom. In the past, many people, due to the mischief of departmentalism, only emphasized the mistakes of others, but now they are stricter with themselves. Therefore, there are new perspectives on many old problems. For example, at the magnetic separation plant construction site, the mechanical installation unit had a crane that was idle, but refused to lend it to the electrical installation unit. The electrical installation unit thought, "Anyway, no one else should use it," and absurdly cut off the power supply, causing the mechanical installation unit to stop work for half a day. In the past, everyone always thought that the fault lay with others, and they were not convinced even when they were punished. Now, everyone says that they were wrong. The mechanical installation unit made a self-criticism for not lending the crane. If the crane had been lent, this would not have happened, so the mistake should be their responsibility. The electrical installation unit also realized that their retaliatory measure of cutting off the power supply was an even more serious mistake. This enabled both parties to resolve the problem ideologically.
    After the ideological examination of opposing departmentalism went deeper, the socialist consciousness of many cadres was raised. For example, Liu Yecheng, the leader of the Second Team of the Metal Structure Engineering Company, was a party member who came from a working class background of more than 50 years old. He had always been active in his work, but he was also infected with serious departmentalism, and the fraternal units had many opinions about him. Through criticism and self-criticism, as well as education through detailed accounting, especially when he learned that if the project they were responsible for was put into production one day late, the state would produce 3.6 million yuan less wealth, he shed tears of remorse and immediately made a profound self-criticism, which moved many people. Su Diancheng, the director of a work area of the Rolling Mill Engineering Company, realized the harm of departmentalism and said painfully: "The Party wants us to build socialism, but I am hindering socialist construction!" Later, they all took the initiative to correct departmentalist phenomena and actively cooperate to create conditions for fraternal units to complete the state plan.
    In the past, some units had long-term disputes over some minor issues, which seriously affected the progress of the project. After the criticism of departmentalism, these long-term wrangling issues were quickly resolved. For example, at the chemical plant construction site, 30-odd "wrangling" incidents that had not been resolved for a long time were resolved in three days after the political work meeting at the construction site. The construction of the railway next to the sulfur workshop of the Chemical General Factory, which was being undertaken by the Steelmaking Engineering Company, affected the passage of trains. Originally, it should have been immediately reinforced after the construction was completed so that the train could resume traffic, but they refused to do so on the pretext that "the 200 yuan reinforcement fee could not be paid." As a result, the production unit had to use horse-drawn carts instead of trains to transport sulfur for a long time. After the political work meeting at the construction site, the problem that had not been resolved for more than 40 days was solved at once. The more than 60 small foundation projects of a substation undertaken by the Rolling Mill Engineering Company were delayed for more than three months because the construction unit felt that "there was no profit." After the criticism of departmentalism, the company manager personally took action and completed it all in just 10 days. Due to the liquidation of departmentalist ideology, the overall concept of active cooperation began to grow. The installation project of steel windows in the crystallization workshop of the chemical plant was originally planned to be completed in 40 days, and it was felt to be very difficult, mainly because the leadership did not promote the construction method of parallel flow operation, because to promote parallel flow operation, it was necessary to actively cooperate closely, which was "too troublesome and time-consuming." After the criticism of departmentalism, parallel flow operation was immediately promoted, and the installation task was completed in 20 days.
    As a result of the active cooperation and coordination of the construction units, many projects were completed ahead of schedule and started ahead of schedule, and many things that were impossible in the past became possible. Two heating furnaces in the primary rolling mill were completed 46 days ahead of schedule after the construction unit strengthened cooperation and actively took measures, creating 6.7 million yuan of wealth for the country. The No. 4 blast furnace of the Ironmaking Plant was originally scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of this year, but it was put into production one quarter ahead of schedule due to the good cooperation between the Blast Furnace Company and the Ironmaking Plant. According to the original situation, it was difficult for Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company to complete the workload in the fourth quarter of 1955. However, due to the criticism of departmentalism by various units and the tapping of production potential, by the end of the year, they actually completed more than 1.1 million yuan of work than planned. This greatly changed the situation in the first three quarters.
    The experience of Anshan City tells us that the reason why departmentalism in the basic construction departments of Anshan City has existed for a long time and seriously is mainly because the Municipal Committee has long abandoned the criticism and struggle against this erroneous ideology. Once the Municipal Committee launched a criticism and struggle against departmentalism, once it made clear to the broad masses of cadres and workers the harm of departmentalism, the ideology and work style of departmentalism would immediately suffer a fatal blow, the ideology of collectivism and the overall concept would immediately begin to grow, the phenomenon of wrangling would be greatly reduced, and the progress of the project would be greatly accelerated. However, to completely correct departmentalism, it cannot be completely resolved by several meetings of criticism and a short period of effort. The recent resurgence of departmentalism in individual units in Anshan is a clear proof. Therefore, it is required that the Party organization often pay attention to educating cadres to establish an overall concept and pay attention to fighting departmentalism at any time.

    清算本位主义思想
    本报记者　金雨困
    本位主义只看到本单位的局部的利益，却看不到革命事业的整体利益，甚至为了自己局部的利益，不惜去损害革命的整体利益。本位主义是涣散和腐蚀革命事业的毒素。因之，本位主义是和革命的集体主义绝不相容的。而这种本位主义在鞍山的基本建设部门中曾经长期地严重地存在着，本位主义在这里还有一个通俗的称呼，就是“扯皮”，就是互不信任，互不支持，互相埋怨，彼此牵制。有的人认为“老实人不会扯皮，就要吃亏”“不本位就完不成计划”。甚至还有人把“扯皮”当作“先进经验”来推广，谁会“扯皮”就是谁有“才干”。因此，有的人有本位主义思想，不以为耻，反以为荣。鞍山钢铁建设公司去年前九个月没有完成国家计划，13项主要工程就有11项工程没有达到建设进度的要求，是和这种严重的本位主义思想和作风分不开的。
    去年10月，在中共辽宁省委负责同志领导之下，鞍山市委召开了基本建设单位负责党员干部会议。这次会议对本位主义作了严肃的批评和自我批评，对那些本位主义作风严重的单位指名进行了批评。
    比如鞍山钢铁建设公司金属结构工程公司，本应在1954年11月末完成大孤山磁选厂的吊车梁工程，但由于他们嫌这个工程“油水不大”，对完成自己的工作量起不了什么作用，因此虽作过数十次交工日期的决议，但一拖再拖，一直拖到1955年3月20日才算完成。结果就使设备安装任务拖延了104天。
    会议还对一些主动协作的单位作了表扬，比如筑炉工程公司就介绍了一个这种主动协作的榜样，由于甲乙双方发挥了社会主义企业兄弟般的互助协作精神，把别人的困难当作自己的困难，把帮助别人当作自己应尽的义务。互相帮助，同心协力，密切配合的结果，使所负担的工程由原计划90天的工期缩短到58天就完成了。
    这次会议对于一切犯过本位主义错误的人从思想上是一次极大的震动。普遍认为“这是鞍山市几年来没有过的深刻教育”。
    为了贯彻这次会议的精神，会后，市委立即组织工作组深入各单位进行检查。各基本建设单位党委也随即召开会议，各工地也分别召开工地政治工作会议，广泛发动广大职工来检查和反对本位主义。
    这样，批评和自我批评就由上而下地广泛开展起来。过去很多人由于本位主义思想的作怪，只强调别人的错误，现在则严于责己，因此对许多老问题都有了新看法。如磁选厂工地，机装单位有一吊车放着不用，电装单位要借用却不给，电装单位认为“反正谁也别用”，竟荒唐地截断了电源，使机装单位停工半天。过去大家一直认为错在人家，虽受了处分也不服气，现在大家都说自己不对，机装单位检讨有吊车不借的不对，如果借了吊车就不会发生这样的事情，因此错误应由自己负责。而电装单位也认识到自己采取截断电源的报复办法更是严重的错误，这就使双方从思想上解决了问题。
    反对本位主义的思想检查深入以后，很多干部的社会主义觉悟有了提高。如金属结构工程公司第二队队长刘业成，是个50多岁老工人出身的党员，工作一贯积极，但也沾染了严重的本位主义，兄弟单位对他意见很多。通过批评和自我批评以及算细账的教育，特别是当他了解到他们所担负的工程迟一天投入生产，就要使国家少生产360多万元的财富，使他沉痛地流下泪来，马上作了深刻的检查，感动了很多人。轧钢工程公司一工区主任苏殿成认识了本位主义的危害后，沉痛地说：“党要我们去建设社会主义，我却在阻碍社会主义建设！”以后，他们都是亲自动手纠正本位主义现象，积极主动地进行协作，为兄弟单位完成国家计划创造条件。
    过去，有的单位为一些细小问题长期争执不休，严重地影响了工程的进行。经过对本位主义的批判以后，这些长期扯皮的问题得到了迅速的解决。如化工工地在工地政治工作会议后，三天中就解决了长期没有解决的“扯皮”事件30多起。炼钢工程公司在化工总厂的硫?车间的火车道旁施工影响了火车通行，本来施工完毕后就应立即进行加固，以便火车恢复通行，但他们借口“200元加固费没法开支”，不干。结果生产单位不得不长期用马车代替火车运送硫?。工地政治工作会议以后，40多天没有解决的问题一下子就解决了。轧钢工程公司所担负某变电所60多个小基础工程，因为施工单位认为“油水不大”，延期了3个多月，影响了整个工程的速度。批判本位主义后，公司经理便亲自动手，只用了10天时间就把它全部干完了。由于清算了本位主义思想，主动协作的整体观念开始成长起来，化工工地结晶车间钢窗安装工程，原来计划40天完成，还感到非常困难，主要是领导上不推行平行流水作业的施工方法，因为要推行平行流水作业，就必须主动密切配合，这样“太麻烦费事”。批判本位主义后，马上推行了平行流水作业，结果用了20天的时间就完成了安装任务。
    各施工单位主动协作配合的结果，使许多工程提前竣工和提前开工了，许多过去不可能的事情变成可能了。一初轧工地两个均热炉，施工单位加强了协作，主动采取了措施后，就提前46天竣工了，为国家多创造了670万元财富。炼铁厂的4号鼓炉本来要到今年第一季度才能竣工，由于高炉公司和炼铁厂配合得好，提前了一个季度投入生产。根据本来的情况，鞍山钢铁建设公司要完成1955年第四季度的工作量是困难的。但是，由于各单位批判了本位主义思想，挖掘了生产潜力，到年底，实际上是比计划还多做了1，100多万元的工作量。这就大大改变了前3个季度的情况。
    鞍山市的经验告诉我们：鞍山市基本建设部门的本位主义所以长期地严重地存在，主要是由于市委长期放弃了对这种错误思想的批评和斗争。只要市委一旦展开了对本位主义的批评和斗争，一旦向广大干部和职工说清楚本位主义的危害性，本位主义的思想和作风就立即受到致命的打击，集体主义思想和整体观念就立即开始成长起来，扯皮的现象大大减少，工程进度也大大加快。但是要彻底纠正本位主义，并不是经过几次会议的批判和一个短时期的努力就可以彻底解决的。最近本位主义在鞍山个别单位又有抬头的现象，便是明证。因此，就要求党组织经常地注意教育干部树立整体观念、注意随时和本位主义进行斗争。
