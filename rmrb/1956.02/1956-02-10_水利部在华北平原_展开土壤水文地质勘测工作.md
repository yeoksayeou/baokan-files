Ministry of Water Resources Undertakes Soil Hydrogeological Survey Work in the North China Plain

    In order to make a unified plan for the irrigation areas in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Hai River Basin, the Ministry of Water Resources organized a soil survey team to carry out soil and hydrogeological surveys in the North China Plain. In the past six months, with the help of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this survey team has completed a general soil survey of more than 35,000 square kilometers and a detailed soil survey of more than 700 square kilometers; at the same time, it has investigated more than 3,000 hydrogeological points, arranged 82 long-term groundwater observation wells, conducted 23 experiments on the physical properties of soil moisture, and investigated agricultural production conditions in conjunction with soil characteristics. At present, the survey team is sorting out and summarizing these data, and conducting specimen testing and analysis.

    In addition to completing the survey task of 97,000 square kilometers in the North China Plain this year, this survey team will also conduct a survey of 27,000 square kilometers in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. (Fang Sheng)

    水利部在华北平原
    展开土壤水文地质勘测工作
    为了作好黄河下游及海河流域灌区的统一规划，水利部组织土壤调查队在华北平原展开土壤和水文地质勘测工作。半年多来，这支勘测队在中国科学院帮助下，已经完成了土壤概测35，000多平方公里，土壤详测700多平方公里；同时调查了水文地质点3，000多个，布置了地下水长期观测井82个，进行了23个土壤水分物理性质的试验，并且结合土壤特性对农业生产情况进行了调查。目前，勘测队正在整理和总结这些资料，进行标本化验、分析等工作。
    这支勘测队今年除将完成华北平原97，000平方公里的勘测任务外，还将进行黄河中游27，000平方公里的勘测工作。　（方生）
