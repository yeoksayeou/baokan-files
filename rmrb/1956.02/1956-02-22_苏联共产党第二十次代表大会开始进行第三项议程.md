    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, February 21st: The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its sessions on the morning of February 21st and began the third item on the agenda: the directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union.  Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, walked to the podium amidst warm applause from the entire audience and delivered the report.

    Report on the Proceedings of the CPSU Congress on February 20th

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, via TASS: The representatives who spoke at the morning session of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on February 20th unanimously endorsed the report of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

    At the morning session, the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, said in his congratulatory message that studying the report of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the directives of the Congress on the Sixth Five-Year Plan would help the Indonesian people better understand the goals of the struggle of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. Aidit went on to say that our country has not yet gained complete independence. Our people are seeking ways and means to defend and consolidate their independence. The warm response of peace-loving people around the world, especially the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, to the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries, has strengthened the Indonesian people's belief that the struggle for independence and peace is a great and victorious struggle that spans all countries and continents.

    Zedendenbal, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, said that the entire activity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a shining example of selfless service to the people, to the cause of democracy and socialism, and is an example of how to put Marxism-Leninism into practice and constructively develop and enrich it on the basis of historical experience. The working people of the Mongolian People's Republic know very well from personal experience that their friendship and cooperation with the Soviet people are the key to the happiness and prosperity of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party will continue to educate our people in the spirit of the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism, in the spirit of maintaining fraternal friendship with the peoples of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries, and in the spirit of the international solidarity of the working people in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    Altonen conveyed greetings on behalf of the Finnish Communist Party and the working people. He said: The great progress made by the Soviet people in building a communist society, as well as the selfless assistance provided by the Soviet Union to other countries, has aroused great interest among the Finnish working people and has been met with their admiration. The Finnish people are widely convinced that friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union are the most reliable guarantee for the peaceful development of our country. In the future, the main task of the Finnish Communist Party will remain to implement a policy of maintaining peace and establishing closer friendly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union. The Finnish Communist Party will strive to establish a united front of the working people in our country and to fight for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    The entire delegation warmly welcomed Ibárruri, the representative of the Spanish Communist Party, and Codovilla, the representative of the Argentine Communist Party, who delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress.

    Ibárruri said that the fundamental issues of the current international situation raised by Comrade Khrushchev in his report, such as the peaceful coexistence of two systems, the possibility of preventing wars in the present era, the forms of transition to socialism in different countries, and the attitude towards social democracy, are of great significance to communist parties and workers' organizations worldwide. She said that these arguments can especially help the Spanish Communist Party to end the narrow sectarian ideas that are still hindering our work. These arguments not only help us find favorable grounds to reach mutual understanding with the working people led by the Socialist Party, with anarchists, and with Catholics, but also to reach mutual understanding with national bourgeois forces. One of the most urgent tasks of the Spanish communists in their struggle for democracy is to achieve the unity of the working class and to establish a national front, which should include all forces that have different social statuses, political and religious beliefs, but all hope for some political change in our country.

    Codovilla said that the people of Argentina and other Latin American countries believe that thanks to the wise and steadfast peaceful policies pursued by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries, it has become possible to unite all peace-loving forces to participate in a powerful global front sufficient to prevent new wars. For this, we would like to express our deep gratitude to you.

    Codovilla said that during a period of intensified crisis phenomena that bring suffering to the people in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, you have made progressive decisions on the issues that concern the people. Every step you take in the historical events of communist construction and defense of peace is a support for the struggles of the people of all countries for national and social liberation.

    Subsequently, the Chairman of the meeting, Suslov, announced that 51 representatives had spoken in the discussion on the summary report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The presidium received a proposal to stop the discussion. This proposal was adopted.

    Suslov also said that Comrade N.S. Khrushchev did not intend to make a final speech, because all the speakers fully agreed with the views and conclusions in the summary report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Comrade Kozlov then spoke. On behalf of the party organizations of Moscow, Leningrad, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Latvia, and other places, he proposed the following resolution on the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:

    "The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, after hearing the summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, N.S. Khrushchev, resolves:

    To fully endorse the policy direction and practical work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."

    The representatives unanimously adopted this resolution. At this time, the hall resounded with stormy and prolonged applause. All attendees stood up.

    Suslov continued, saying that some representatives had proposed the establishment of a committee to be responsible for drafting a detailed resolution on the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and for restoring the good practices that existed before the Sixteenth Party Congress (including the Sixteenth Party Congress).

    The Congress unanimously elected the following members of this committee:

    Khrushchev (Chairman), Aristov, Babayev, N.I. Belyaev, I.P. Belyaev, Boitsov, Brezhnev, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Gafurov, Daniyalov, Denisov, Doronin, Zhegalin, Zhukov, Ignatov, Ignatiev, Kaganovich, Kahnberzin, Karchenko, Kapitonov, Kirilenko, Kirichenko, Kiselev, Kozlov, Kebin, Kuusinen, Larionov, Malenkov, Mzhavanadze, Mikoyan, Mikhailov, Molotov, Muratov, Mustafayev, Mukhitdinov, Organov, Patolichev, Pervukhin, Ponomarenko, Pospelov, Pusin, Razakov, Saburov, Serdyuk, Sniečkus, Struyev, V.M. Suslov, M.A. Suslov, Titov, Tovmasyan, Furtseva, Shvernik, Shelepin, Shepilov, and Shkolnikov.

    Subsequently, the Congress also passed a resolution approving the report of the Central Auditing Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    The Congress will continue on February 21st.

    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会开始进行第三项议程
    本报莫斯科21日专电　苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在2月21日上午继续举行会议，开始进行第三项议程：苏联共产党第二十次代表大会对苏联发展国民经济第六个五年计划（1956—1960年）的指示。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在全场热烈鼓掌声中走向讲台，作了报告。
    苏共代表大会20日会议情况
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会2月20日上午会议上发言的代表们一致赞同苏共中央的报告。
    在上午会议上，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在贺词中说，学习苏共中央的报告和大会关于第六个五年计划的指示，将帮助印度尼西亚人民更好地了解苏联共产党和苏联人民的斗争的目的。艾地接着说，我们的国家还没有获得完全的独立。我国人民正在寻找保卫和巩固他们的独立的途径和办法。全世界爱好和平的人民，尤其是苏联各族人民和苏联政府对亚非国家万隆会议的热烈响应，已经加强了印度尼西亚人民的这种信念：争取独立和和平的斗争是一个遍及一切国家和大陆的伟大的和胜利的斗争。
    蒙古人民革命党中央委员会政治局委员泽登巴尔说，苏联共产党的全部活动，是对人民、对民主和社会主义事业的无私服务的光辉榜样，是如何把马克思列宁主义付诸实践并且在历史经验的基础上加以建设性的发展和丰富的榜样。蒙古人民共和国的劳动人民从亲身经验知道得很清楚，他们和苏联人民的友谊和合作，是蒙古人民共和国幸福和繁荣的关键。蒙古人民革命党将继续以马克思列宁主义的不朽思想的精神，用同苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的人民保持兄弟友谊的精神，用劳动人民在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中的国际团结的精神来教育我国人民。
    阿尔托宁代表芬兰共产党和劳动人民致贺词。他说：苏联人民在建设一个共产主义社会中取得的巨大进展，以及苏联给予其他国家的无私的援助，引起了芬兰劳动人民的巨大兴趣，并且得到了他们的赞佩。芬兰人民广泛地确信，和苏联的友谊和合作是我们国家的和平发展的最可靠的保证。今后，芬兰共产党的主要任务仍然是执行维护和平以及芬兰同苏联建立更加牢固的友好关系的政策。芬兰共产党将尽力争取在我国建立劳动人民的统一战线，为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争。
    全体代表热烈欢迎西班牙共产党代表伊巴露丽和阿根廷共产党代表柯都维亚向大会致贺词。
    伊巴露丽说，赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中所提出的关于两个制度的和平共处、关于防止现时代发生战争的可能性，关于不同国家过渡到社会主义的形式和关于对待社会民主党的态度等当前国际形势的基本问题，对全世界共产党和工人组织来说有着巨大的意义。她说，这些论点特别可以帮助西班牙共产党终止还在阻碍着我们工作的狭隘的宗派观念。这些论点不仅帮助我们找到有利的根据来同社会党领导的劳动人民、同无政府主义者和天主教人士取得相互的谅解，而且还可以同民族资产阶级力量取得相互谅解。西班牙共产党人争取民主斗争的最迫切的任务之一，就是要取得工人阶级的团结和建立民族阵线，这个阵线应当包括那些社会地位、政治和宗教信仰不同的、但是都希望我国的政治有所改变的一切力量。
    柯都维亚说，阿根廷和其他拉丁美洲国家的人民认为，由于苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家执行英明的、坚定不移的和平政策，使团结一切和平力量参加足以防止新战争的世界范围内的强大阵线有了可能。为此，我们要向你们表示深深的感激。
    柯都维亚说，在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国家内给人民带来苦难的危机现象加剧的时期中，你们对人民所耽心的问题作了进步的决定。你们在共产主义建设和保卫和平的历史性事件中的每一个步骤，都是对各国人民争取民族和社会解放的斗争的支持。
    随后，会议主席苏斯洛夫宣布，在就苏联共产党中央委员会的总结报告所作的讨论中，有51个代表发言。主席团收到了一件主张停止讨论的建议。这项建议被采纳了。
    苏斯洛夫还说，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志不拟作最后的发言了，因为所有的发言人都完全同意苏联共产党中央委员会的总结报告中的观点和结论。
    科兹洛夫同志接着发言。他代表莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、格鲁吉亚、乌兹别克、拉脱维亚等地党组织提议，就苏联共产党中央委员会的报告通过下列决议：
    “苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在听取苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志关于苏联共产党中央委员会工作的总结报告以后通过决议：
    完全赞同苏联共产党中央委员会的政策方针和实际工作。”
    代表们一致通过了这个决议。这时，大厅中响起了暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。全体到会者起立。
    苏斯洛夫接着说，有代表提议成立一个委员会，负责起草党代表大会关于苏联共产党中央委员会报告的详尽的决议草案和恢复第十六次党代表大会以前（包括第十六次党代表大会在内）所存在的良好的实际情况。
