Xinhua News Agency, February 9th. According to materials from the National Water Conservancy and Hydropower Resources Survey Conference, the total hydropower reserves of China, as roughly estimated, have greatly exceeded previous estimates made before liberation. Calculated by average flow, the total reserves are approximately 540 million kilowatts, similar to those of the Soviet Union, the country with the richest hydropower resources in the world. If calculated with a utilization coefficient of 50% to 60%, about 300 million kilowatts of hydropower can be developed.

The distribution of these hydropower resources is as follows: the Southwest and Tibet regions are the richest, accounting for about 72% of the country's total reserves; the Central South, Northwest, East China, and Northeast regions are next; and the North China and Inner Mongolia regions have the least.

The Yangtze River is China's largest river. Past estimates of the total hydropower reserves of this river were 82.7 million kilowatts. Now, the Hydropower Generation Construction Bureau has re-estimated based on recent data, totaling about 220 million kilowatts. The Yangtze River's main stream and its tributaries, including the Min River, Jialing River, Wu River, Yuan River, Zi River, and Han River, can all be used to build many large hydropower stations. Although the average flow of the Yellow River is less than one-twentieth of that of the Yangtze River, according to the results of key explorations over the past few years, it has been found that the hydropower resources below Guide in Qinghai alone can be used to generate 23 million kilowatts, and the total reserves in the entire basin are about 33 million kilowatts, exceeding the original estimate by more than 80%. In addition, the estimated hydropower resources of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, Nujiang River, Lancang River in the Southwest region, as well as the Pearl River, Heilongjiang River, and Qiantang River and other major rivers, have all exceeded the original estimates. The Yarlung Tsangpo River alone, at a large river bend at the junction of Kang and Tibet, has 30 million kilowatts of hydropower resources, exceeding the original estimate by 50%.

According to the person in charge of the Hydropower Generation Construction Bureau, China's hydropower resources are not only very abundant, but also have many favorable conditions for development. First, many rivers have excellent hydropower sites with great comprehensive utilization effects. After these rivers are surveyed and designed to make basin plans, not only can hydropower stations be built, but also comprehensive tasks such as flood control, irrigation, and navigation can be solved at the same time. The locations of these hydropower sites are also very good, and most of them are very close to industrial and mining cities. The Sanmenxia on the Yellow River is only three or four hundred kilometers away from industrial cities such as Taiyuan, Xi'an, and Zhengzhou. The famous Three Gorges of the Yangtze River are even more conveniently located. If calculated using the Soviet Union's farthest power transmission distance of 1,000 kilometers, cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Ya'an can all use the electricity generated by the Three Gorges in the future.

The person in charge also mentioned another very favorable condition of China's hydropower resources. He said that due to the natural conditions of the rivers, the amount of earth and stone excavation and concrete pouring required to build hydropower stations in the future will be less, the construction period will be shorter, and the cost will be lower. For example, the average cost per kilowatt of the several hydropower stations currently under construction is only half as expensive as that of thermal power plants. And the construction cost per kilowatt of large hydropower stations will be cheaper than that of thermal power plants.

### 我国水力资源总蕴藏量达五亿多瓩

    我国水力资源总蕴藏量达五亿多瓩
    新华社9日讯　根据全国水利、水力资源普查会议的材料，目前中国极粗略估算出来的水力资源的总蕴藏量，已经大大超过解放以前所作的估计。按平均流量估算，总蕴藏量约有54，000万瓩，和世界上水力资源最丰富的苏联相近。如果以利用系数50％到60％计算，也有3亿瓩左右的水力可以开发。
    这些水力资源的分布情况是：西南和西藏地区最丰富，约占全国蕴藏量的72％，中南、西北、华东、东北地区次之，华北和内蒙古地区最少。
    长江是中国第一大河。过去估计这条河流的水力总蕴藏量是8，270万瓩，现在水力发电建设总局根据最近资料重新加以估算，总计约有22，000万瓩。长江干流以及它的支流岷江、嘉陵江、乌江、沅水、资水、汉水等，都可以建设许多巨大的水电站。黄河的平均流量虽然不及长江的二十分之一，可是根据几年来重点勘查的结果，查明只青海贵德以下的水力资源就可以用来发电2，300万瓩，全流域总蕴藏量约为3，300万瓩，超过原来估算80％以上。除此以外，西南地区的雅鲁藏布江、怒江、澜沧江，以及珠江、黑龙江、钱塘江等主要河流，已估算出来的水力资源也都超过了原来的估计。雅鲁藏布江只是康藏交界处的一个大河湾，就蕴藏有3，000万瓩的水力资源，超过原来估计50％。
    据水力发电建设总局的负责人说，中国的水力资源不但非常丰富，而且具有开发上的许多有利条件。首先是许多河流都有着优良的有巨大综合利用效用的水力地址，这些河流经过勘查设计做出流域规划以后，不但可以建设水电站，还能同时解决防洪、灌溉和航运等综合任务。这些水力地址的位置也都很好，大部分距离工矿城市很近。黄河的三门峡离太原、西安、郑州等工业城市都只三、四百公里。著名的长江三峡地位更为适中，如果以苏联最远的输电距离1，000公里来计算，将来北京、上海、广州、雅安等城市，都可以利用三峡发出来的电力。
    这个负责人还说到了中国水力资源的另一个非常有利的条件。他说，由于河流的天然条件，将来建设水电站所需开挖的土石方和浇筑混凝土工程量都较少，建设的时期短，造价也较低。例如，目前正在建设的几个水电站，平均每瓩造价都只比火力发电站贵半倍。而大的水电站的建设，每瓩造价将比火力发电站还要便宜。
