    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's political report, which gives us direction for our future work. I support the reports of the leading comrades on the transformation of intellectuals and the elimination of all counter-revolutionaries. China's socialist revolution has now reached a high tide. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce has achieved basic victory, and the country's construction is entering a new stage of development. This unprecedented development, this new development with a bright future, fills each of us with boundless joy and excitement. Now that the Draft National Agricultural Development Program has been published, other construction undertakings must also catch up in an all-round way, and rapidly eliminating the backwardness of science is an important part of this.
    Based on my personal experience in my work, I would like to talk about the current situation and prospects of Chinese geological science, and offer some suggestions. If there is anything incorrect, please offer your criticism and guidance.
    In the six years since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, Chinese geological science has seen unprecedented development. Its strength has grown rapidly, and cadre training has achieved great success. These cadres have indeed done a lot of work and made considerable contributions to the discovery of underground resources and the collection of scientific facts. Under the guidance of advanced Soviet scientific theories, there have been significant changes in working methods and ways of thinking. New fields required for people's construction have also gradually been opened up and a foundation established. The popularization of Chinese geological science has also made new progress. Scientists are excited about the bright future of the motherland and have generated new strength. This fundamental change and rapid development, leading to a convincing and bright path, are inseparable from the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without the leadership of the working class, without the leadership of the working class's Marxism-Leninism, it would not be possible to have such rapid development and such a beautiful future.
    However, the foundation of Chinese geological science is weak and incomplete. Cadres, equipment, books, and world scientific intelligence are not sound enough. Before liberation, the purpose of this science for the benefit of the people was not clear, and the direction of "elucidating the distribution law of useful elements" was not clear, so that it still lags far behind the requirements of production and construction. The continuation of this phenomenon should not be allowed.
    In order to adapt to the new stage of the victorious socialist revolution, the responsibilities of scientific workers are becoming more and more important day by day. Chairman Mao taught us: "Our people should have a grand plan to strive to change our country's backwardness in economy and science and culture within a few decades and quickly reach the world's advanced level. In order to realize this great goal, the decisive factor is to have cadres, to have a sufficient number of excellent scientific and technological experts; at the same time, we must continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front and unite all possible forces."
    Comrades! We must take on this glorious task, and therefore we must take courageous, planned, head-on, necessary and practical measures. First, ensure that scientific work cadres with sufficient ability and sufficient quantity are trained by various methods. Assign a sufficient number of cadres to study the latest scientific achievements, methods, and technologies of advanced countries as soon as possible. Mobilize all forces to undertake the work needed for national construction, accumulate experience and train experts. Combine with the national construction plan to establish, step by step, the work organizations required in various regions and departments, in the near future and ten years later.
    We must ensure the completion of this great combat task, therefore, we must rely on the leadership, rely on the masses; various scientific departments and technical departments must develop side by side, and plan comprehensively; we must learn from the Soviet Union and ensure the maximum efficiency in accepting the scientific theories and methods donated by the Soviet Union; we must study Marxism-Leninism, transform our thinking methods and working methods, and carry out ideological transformation through work and study, especially self-education and self-transformation; strengthen our enthusiasm for the overall cause of the people and strengthen unity.
    The road we are taking is correct, and the future is bright. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have full confidence in successfully and quickly completing this glorious task. I am willing to work with my comrades to do everything possible to improve China's scientific level and serve the rapidly progressing socialist construction.

    侯德封的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理政治报告给我们今后工作方向的指示。拥护各位首长对知识分子改造和肃清一切反革命的报告。现在中国社会主义革命达到了高潮，农业、手工业及私营工商业各方面的社会主义改造都得到了基本的胜利，国家建设形势走入新的发展阶段。这种空前的发展、有光辉前途的新发展，使我们每一个人感到无比的欢欣鼓舞。全国农业发展纲要草案公布以后，其他各项建设事业也必须全面赶上，迅速消除科学落后状况也是其中重要的一环。
    就我个人工作岗位上的感觉谈谈中国地质科学的现状、远景和意见。如有不正确的地方，请批评指教。
    解放六年来，在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，中国地质科学有空前的发展，力量是迅速增长着，干部培养收到很大成绩，这些干部的确也作了不少工作，对揭发地下资源和搜集科学事实有不少贡献。工作方法和思想方法在先进的苏联科学理论指导之下有了很大改变。人民建设所需要的空白科门也逐渐开辟了园地建立基础。中国地质科学的群众化工作也有了新的进展。科学家们对祖国肯定的光明前途感到了兴奋并产生了新的力量。这种根本的改变与迅速的发展，走向了使人信服的光明道路，是和中国共产党的正确领导分不开的。如果没有工人阶级领导，没有工人阶级的马克思列宁主义的领导，是不可能有这样迅速发展和这美丽前途的。
    但是中国地质科学基础是薄弱的，不完全的，干部、设备、图书、世界科学情报，都不够健全。在解放以前这门科学对人民谋福利的目的是不清楚的，对“阐明有用元素的分布规律”这个方向是不明确的，以致现在还远远落在生产建设要求的后面，这种现象的继续是不应该允许的。
    为了适应社会主义革命胜利进行的新阶段，科学工作者的责任一天一天的更重大起来。毛主席教导我们说：“我国人民应该有一个远大的规划，要在几十年内，努力改变我国在经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，迅速达到世界上的先进水平。为了实现这个伟大的目标，决定一切的是要有干部，要有数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家；同时，要继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量。”
    同志们！我们必须担当起这一光荣任务，因此就必须采取勇敢的、有计划的、迎头赶上的、必要而切实的措施。首先保证用各种方法培养有足够能力、足够数量的科学工作干部。要尽快的分配足够数量的干部学习先进国家最新的科学成就、方法和技术。发动一切力量担任国家建设需要的工作，积累经验培养专家。要结合国家建设计划有步骤的建立各地区的、各科门的、近年和十年以后所需要的工作机构。
    我们要保证完成这一伟大的战斗任务，因此，就必须依靠领导，依靠群众；必须各科学部门、技术部门并肩发展，全面规划；必须学习苏联，保证最大效率的接受苏联赠予的科学理论和方法；必须学习马列主义，改造思想方法和工作方法，通过工作和学习进行思想改造尤其是自我教育，自我改造；加强对整体人民事业的热情，加强团结。
    我们所走的道路是正确的，前途是光明的。在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导之下，我们完全有信心胜利迅速完成这一光荣任务。我愿意和同志们一道，尽一切力量为提高中国科学水平、服务迅速进展的社会主义建设而努力。
