    The Great Alliance

    Today is the 6th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and the people of China and the Soviet Union are enthusiastically celebrating this day, celebrating the further consolidation of this alliance, and celebrating its increasing role in strengthening the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and safeguarding world peace.

    Today is also the opening day of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. While celebrating the Sino-Soviet alliance, the Chinese people are celebrating the convening of this congress with the same warm feelings. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, armed with Marxism-Leninism and possessing rich experience and invincible strength, is forever a glorious example and mentor for the Communist Party of China and all proletarian parties in the world. The great achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union over the past few decades, and the great contributions they have made to the cause of human liberation, are forever a great source of encouragement for the people of our country and all working people in the world. The convening of this congress will undoubtedly make new contributions to the Soviet Union's communist construction and to the cause of human progress and world peace. The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the success of this congress.

    The international situation in recent years has convincingly proved that the close cooperation and rock-solid unity between China and the Soviet Union are important factors in safeguarding world peace and promoting international cooperation. The Soviet Union has consistently supported our people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and has continuously striven to restore our country's legitimate status and rights in the United Nations. Thanks to the joint efforts of China, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries, the Korean War was stopped, and peace was restored in Indochina. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India have been supported by more and more countries. The Bandung Conference, which advocated peaceful coexistence and opposed colonialism, made a great contribution to the cause of maintaining world peace. Thanks to the initiative of the Soviet Union and the joint efforts of other peace-loving countries, a series of important international issues have been resolved, and the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference was able to be held. Now, resolving international disputes through consultation and easing international tensions has become the common demand of hundreds of millions of people around the world. Due to the active efforts of China and the Soviet Union, and the unremitting struggle of all peace-loving people and countries around the world to defend peace, the war policy of the American aggressive bloc has had to suffer a fatal blow, and international tensions have had to tend to ease. The peaceful foreign policies of China and the Soviet Union are fully in line with the interests of all peace-loving people and have been warmly supported by all peace-loving people around the world.

    While China and the Soviet Union have achieved new victories in their peaceful foreign policies, they have also achieved new and significant surges in economic construction. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, bringing the Soviet Union a big step closer to communism. Now, on the basis of the completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Sixth Five-Year Plan is being implemented. According to this plan, the Soviet Union will further vigorously develop all sectors of the national economy, rapidly develop agricultural production, and greatly improve the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people on this basis, based on prioritizing the development of heavy industry, continuously improving technology, and increasing labor productivity. Undoubtedly, the implementation of this Five-Year Plan will advance the Soviet economy to a higher level in terms of the scale of communist construction. Since the second half of last year, the Chinese people have also entered a high tide of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are striding forward on the road of socialism, and a high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce has been set off across the country. Comrade Mao Zedong predicted that "in about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed throughout the country." The accelerated development and great achievements of China and the Soviet Union in economic construction will make the Sino-Soviet alliance even stronger and more consolidated.

    The Chinese people have received great selfless assistance from the Soviet Union in carrying out the great socialist construction. The Chinese people deeply know that Soviet assistance is an important factor in our country's economic development and in transforming our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. During the six years of the Sino-Soviet alliance, the Soviet Union has provided comprehensive and large-scale assistance to our country, enabling our country to rapidly restore its economy in the short few years after liberation and begin the planned construction of the national economy on this basis. The 156 important projects that the Soviet Union helped our country build are an important foundation for our country's implementation of the Five-Year Plan for socialist construction. As of the end of last year, 29 of these projects have been put into production, and they have been tirelessly producing for our country's socialist construction day and night, accumulating wealth for the Chinese people. The large-scale grain farms that the Soviet Union helped our country build have already carried out an autumn harvest, setting an example for the mechanization of our country's agriculture. In order to help our country solve technical problems in socialist construction, the Soviet Union has sent a large number of excellent experts to our country in the past few years. They have worked hard, set an example, and helped our country train a large number of cadres. The Chinese people clearly realize that the rapid development of our country's economy and the great achievements in socialist construction are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The Chinese people will never forget the Soviet Union's great, selfless, brotherly friendship based on internationalism. The Chinese people must further intensify their study from the Soviet Union on the road of socialist construction, closely integrate the Soviet Union's advanced experience with the reality of our country's socialist construction, and thus promote our country's socialist cause.

    On the occasion of celebrating the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism is not reconciled to its failure. They are still trying everything possible to make the already easing international situation tense again. They are still continuing to expand their arms and prepare for war, organize military blocs, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and create new disputes. The American aggressors are still occupying our territory of Taiwan. Therefore, while celebrating the major achievements China and the Soviet Union have made in diplomacy and economy over the past year, the Chinese people must continue to maintain their clear heads, redouble their vigilance, and prevent all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks. The Chinese people clearly know that as long as China and the Soviet Union are more united, as long as our peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is stronger and more consolidated, our internal unity is stronger, and our economic and defense forces are stronger, then any enemy's war provocations can be repelled. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Chinese people's valiant advance on the road of socialist construction cannot be stopped by any enemy. The schemes of all war instigators are bound to be completely bankrupt in the face of the powerful and invincible Sino-Soviet alliance.

    伟大的同盟
    今天是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的六周年，中苏两国人民都在热烈地庆祝这个日子，庆祝这个同盟的进一步巩固，庆祝它在加强中苏两国人民的友谊和保卫世界和平事业中所发生的越来越大的作用。
    今天又是苏联共产党第二十次代表大会开幕的日子，中国人民在庆祝中苏同盟的同时以同样热烈的心情庆祝这次大会的召开。以马克思列宁主义武装起来并具有丰富经验和战无不胜的苏联共产党，永远是中国共产党和全世界一切无产阶级政党光辉的榜样和导师。苏联人民在苏联共产党领导下几十年来所获得的巨大成就，对人类解放事业所作的巨大的贡献，永远是我国人民和全世界一切劳动人民的巨大的鼓舞力量。这次代表大会的召开，无疑地，将对苏联的共产主义建设和对人类进步和世界和平的事业作出新的贡献，中国人民衷心地祝贺这次大会的成功。
    几年来的国际局势令人信服地证明：中苏两国的亲密合作和坚如磐石的团结，是保卫世界和平和促进国际合作的重要因素。苏联一贯支持我国人民解放台湾的斗争，并不断为恢复我国在联合国的合法地位和权利而努力。由于中苏两国和其他爱好和平国家的共同努力，朝鲜战争停止了，印度支那恢复了和平。中国和印度共同倡导的和平共处的五项原则得到了越来越多的国家的支持。主张和平共处、反对殖民主义的万隆会议对维护世界和平的事业作出了巨大的贡献。由于苏联的主动和其他爱好和平的国家的共同努力，一系列的重要国际问题获得了解决，日内瓦四国政府首脑会议得以召开。现在，用协商方式解决国际争端和和缓国际紧张局势已经成为世界亿万人民的共同要求。由于中苏两国的积极努力，和全世界爱好和平的人民和国家为保卫和平而进行的不懈斗争，美国侵略集团的战争政策就不得不受到致命的打击，国际紧张局势就不得不趋向缓和。中苏两国的和平外交政策，完全符合一切爱好和平人民的利益，受到了全世界一切爱好和平的人民的热烈拥护。
    与中苏两国在和平外交政策上获得新的胜利同时，中苏两国在经济建设上也获得新的巨大的高涨。苏联人民在苏联共产党领导下提前完成了五年计划，使苏联又向共产主义大大前进了一步。现在又在第五个五年计划完成的基础上开始实行第六个五年计划。按照这个计划，苏联将要在优先发展重工业，不断改进技术和提高劳动生产率的基础上，进一步大力发展国民经济的各部门，迅速发展农业生产，并在这个基础上大大提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平。无疑地，这个五年计划的实施，将会使苏联的经济在共产主义建设的规模上推进到一个更高的水平。中国人民从去年下半年以来也进入了社会主义建设和社会主义改造的高潮，中国人民在中国共产党领导下正在社会主义的道路上阔步前进，农业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造的高潮已在全国掀起。毛泽东同志预言“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成”。中苏两国在经济建设上的加速发展和巨大成就，将会使中苏同盟更加强大和更加巩固。
    中国人民在进行伟大的社会主义建设的时候，得到了苏联的伟大无私的援助。中国人民深切地知道，苏联的援助是我国经济发展和把我国从落后的农业国转变成先进的工业国的重要因素。中苏同盟的六年来，苏联对我国进行了全面的规模巨大的援助，使我国在解放后的短短几年中，能够迅速地恢复了自己的经济，并在这一基础上开始了国民经济的有计划建设。苏联帮助我国建设的156项重要工程，是我国进行社会主义建设实行五年计划的重要基础。截至去年底止，这些工程已有29项投入了生产，它们已日夜不息地为我国的社会主义建设进行生产，为中国人民积累财富。苏联帮助我国建设的大型谷物农场，已进行了一次秋收，为我国农业的机械化树立了榜样。为了帮助我国解决在社会主义建设中的技术问题，在过去几年中，苏联向我国派遣了大量的优秀的专家，他们在工作中克苦耐劳，以身作则，帮助我国培养了大批干部。中国人民清楚地认识到，我国经济的能够迅速发展和社会主义建设的能够得到这样巨大的成就，都是与苏联的大公无私的援助分不开的。中国人民对于苏联这种建立在国际主义基础上的伟大无私的兄弟般的友谊是永志不忘的。中国人民在社会主义建设的道路上必须进一步地加紧向苏联学习，把苏联的先进经验与我国的社会主义建设的实际密切地结合起来，从而推进我国的社会主义事业。
    在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订六周年的今天，以美国帝国主义为首的侵略集团却并不甘心于他们的失败，他们还在想尽一切办法，企图使已经趋向缓和的国际局势重新紧张起来。他们还在继续进行扩军备战和组织军事集团，干涉他国内政和制造新的纠纷。美国侵略者还继续霸占着我国领土台湾。因此，中国人民在庆祝中苏两国一年来在外交和经济上取得重大成就的时候，必须继续保持自己清醒的头脑，加倍地提高自己的警惕，防止敌人的一切阴谋诡计。中国人民清楚地知道，只要中苏两国更加团结，只要我们以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营更加强大巩固，我们的内部更加团结，我们的经济和国防力量更加强大，那么任何敌人的战争挑衅都是可以被击退的。中国人民坚定地相信：中国人民在社会主义建设的道路上奋勇前进，是任何敌人所阻挡不住的。一切战争挑拨者的阴谋，在强大无敌的中苏同盟面前必然遭到彻底的破产。
