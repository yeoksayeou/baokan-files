Comrades! Please allow me, on behalf of the French Communist Party and the French working people, to extend warm and friendly congratulations to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the congress of communist builders! (Applause)
    The working people of the world and all progressive mankind warmly welcome the draft directives of the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy. They see that the Soviet people, under the leadership of their Communist Party, are advancing toward a better future, toward a society of prosperity and happiness for all.
    The inspiring example of the Soviet Union proves that planned and steady development of national productive forces, fundamental improvement of the situation of the working people, satisfaction of their material and cultural needs, substantial reduction of working hours, and full guarantee of support for the disabled and the elderly—all this is inseparable from transferring power into the hands of the working class.
    In contrast, in capitalist France, we see monopoly capitalists constantly enriching themselves, while at the same time, the living standards of the working people are declining day by day, and the working class is constantly being impoverished. The proletariat personally experiences the full cruelty of the objective laws of this capitalist system in their daily lives. The struggle of the working people against human exploitation is intensifying.
    The broad masses of the French people particularly admire the unprecedented efforts made by the Soviet Union in developing science, training numerous cadres, and popularizing knowledge among the broad masses of people from all walks of life. Even reactionary newspapers now have to admit the great progress of this country, which they have so greatly slandered.
    The grand plans included in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, such as the peaceful use of atomic energy, the development of automation, the improvement of technology, and the development of various forms of education, not only arouse the praise of the French intellectual community. These plans show the working class that the vigorous development of a socialist economy, free from crises and contradictions, will inevitably bring about an unprecedented flourishing of the culture of the masses. They show that in the process of advancing toward communism, a comprehensively developed new type of person, possessing all cultural wealth and scientific knowledge, is being formed.
    What a sharp contrast this is compared with the current situation in France, where there are not enough engineers, the ruling groups often undermine science, young researchers live in poverty, and the democratic reform of education is put off for a long time!
    The French Communists, as the true representatives of humanism in their country, are proud that in 1920 they responded to Lenin's call, believing that revolutionary social transformation is necessary to safeguard the future of the motherland and the people.
    While defending the historical interests of the working class, the French Communist Party is also fighting every inch of the way to win the satisfaction of the urgent economic and political demands of the working people. They stand at the forefront of defending peace, and this army of peace unites men and women of different social status and beliefs. The French people know the full significance of the unwavering steps taken by the Soviet Union in the struggle to safeguard peace, to win the victory of the principles of coexistence between countries and countries, to guarantee collective security in Europe and the world, and to resolve the issue of German reunification in accordance with the interests of the German people themselves and the interests of their neighbors.
    Due to the growing strength of the socialist camp and other countries fighting for peace, our people's gratitude and sympathy for the Soviet Union have never been as deep as they are today, and our people have never been as firmly convinced as they are today that it is possible to avoid war. (Prolonged applause)
    The French Communists, loyal to the true national interests of France and the spirit of proletarian internationalism, have opposed the dirty war in Vietnam for many years. They are fighting for the recognition of the actual existence of the Algerian nation and for the establishment of a true French Federation uniting free and equal peoples.
    In order to defend the interests of the masses, to safeguard peace and the future of the motherland, the French Communist Party has always unswervingly strived to establish the united action of the working class. They pointed out the special importance of participating in the joint struggle of Socialists and Communists and the importance of the preliminary results achieved through this joint struggle.
    It is under these conditions that the prestige of the French Communist Party has increased, and it has achieved a great victory in the parliamentary elections of January 2. (Prolonged applause).
    For a long time, the French bourgeois newspapers, radio stations, and all the dirty propaganda organs commanded by the Americans have been spreading lies and slanders against the Soviet Union, against communist ideas, and against the French Communist Party in vain. Some people have taken repressive actions against us in vain, fabricating all possible so-called conspiracies, attempting to split the workers' movement, and at the same time, they are playing this platitude: "The Communist Party is doomed to be eliminated, and they have begun to retreat." Most of the heads of the revolving-door governments went to Washington in vain to express their ability and determination to eliminate communism in France, thereby inadvertently revealing their dependence on American imperialism. Compared with the past, the working class has a greater degree of trust in the French Communist Party. (Stormy and prolonged applause)
    The election results show that the people hope to pursue a peaceful policy towards the Soviet Union, and they will no longer allow themselves to be dragged into the aggressive policies of the Atlantic Group. The imperialist forces openly expressed their painful disappointment with the results of the French elections.
    In order to stop the conspiracies of those who oppose easing international tensions, to smash the attempts of the re-emerging fascists, and to ensure social progress, it is necessary to continue and strengthen the struggle for the unity of the French working class.
    In recent times, the positions of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party have become closer on many issues.
    For example, it must be pointed out that Socialist parliamentarians who participated in the French parliamentary delegation's visit to the Soviet Union became convinced after returning home that the Soviet leaders and people are eager for peace.
    Not only the Communist Party, but also the Socialist Party, demands that the flames of war in Algeria be extinguished quickly and that all issues related to the situation in North Africa be resolved peacefully.
    Socialists and Communists are fighting together to satisfy some economic demands of the working people, to protect and expand democratic freedoms, and to restore education and the non-religious nature of the state.
    As early as 1936, when the Popular Front achieved its first victory in France, the French Communist Party explained to the working class and the people that democracy, which played a necessary and progressive role in the 19th century, had not fully realized all its potential, and the Popular Front was a new step forward in this regard.
    In 1945, the French Communist Party called on the working class and the people to participate in the struggle for a new democracy, free from the control of trusts, in which the working class and its organizations must play a decisive role.
    In a statement to the British "Times" on November 18, 1946, the representative of the French Communist Party, based on the achievements of democracy and socialism worldwide, stated that France could "determine a path to socialism different from the one taken by the Russian Communists," and also spoke of: According to Lenin's theory, "these paths must be different for each country." We said at the time: "We have always believed and said that the French people, with their glorious traditions, will find their own path to greater democracy, progress, and social justice."
    However, history proves that progress is impossible without struggle and without the leadership of the working class headed by the communist vanguard. History also teaches us that if the path to socialism becomes easier, then we must attribute this to the great October Socialist Revolution and to the heroism and selflessness of the Soviet working people, which accelerated the wheels of history. (Applause)
    In order to facilitate their aggressive policies, the American imperialists responded to this conversation by forcing the French Communists to withdraw from the government and excluding them from participating in the political life of their own country.
    However, the masses of people are increasingly aware that the communists' views are correct. They increasingly agree with the views of the communists.
    Relying on the support of the masses, the French Communist Party will unswervingly implement the policy of striving for the unity of the working class and the alliance of democratic forces in the struggle for social progress, peace, and national dignity.
    The French Communist Party is inspired by the rich experience of the glorious Soviet Communist Party; the Soviet Communist Party pointed out the goals to the proletariat of the world, and the help it gave to the French Communist Party is immeasurable throughout the entire history of the French Communist Party. The Soviet Communist Party will always be an example of upholding principles and firmly and unswervingly adhering to the great ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. (Applause)
    Following the example of the Soviet Communist Party, the French Communist Party has always unswervingly striven to maintain the purity of the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism, and will continue to do so in the future. Following the example of the Soviet Communist Party, the French Communist Party has fought for the unity of its ranks, for the application of Leninist principles in party life, and against the enemies of Marxism and opportunists in the workers' movement, and it will continue to wage this struggle in the future.
    Following the example of the Soviet Communist Party, the French Communist Party will always care about the happiness of their people. They will fight to ensure that the French people have a future worthy of their great revolutionary traditions, and they will fight for the future survival of France, because the imperialist policies put the existence of France as a great power into question.
    Long live the Soviet Communist Party, which leads the Soviet people to communist victory! (Stormy applause)
    Long live the great international solidarity of all proletarians! (Stormy applause)
    Long live communism! (Stormy and prolonged applause, all stand up.)

### 多列士在苏共代表大会上的贺词

    多列士在苏共代表大会上的贺词
    同志们！请允许我代表法国共产党和法国劳动人民向苏联共产党第二十次代表大会——共产主义建设者代表大会致以热烈的友好的祝贺。（掌声）
    全世界劳动人民和全体进步人类热烈地欢迎苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划指示草案。他们看到，苏联人民在他们的共产党的领导下，正在向一个更美好的将来，向一个大家繁荣幸福的社会迈进。
    苏联的令人鼓舞的榜样证明了，有计划和稳步地发展国家生产力、根本改善劳动人民的境况、满足他们的物质和文化需要、大大缩短工作日时限、充分保障对残废和老年人的赡养——这一切是同把政权转入工人阶级的手中分不开的。
    和这相反，在资本主义的法国，我们看到垄断资本家在不断致富，而同时，劳动人民的生活水平却在一天天地降低，工人阶级不断贫困化。无产阶级在自己的日常生活中亲身体验了这种资本主义制度的客观规律的全部残酷性。劳动人民反对人剥削人的斗争日益加剧。
    法国广大人民特别钦佩苏联在发展科学、培养众多的干部和向广大的各阶层人民普及知识方面所作的空前的努力。甚至连反动报纸现在也不得不承认它们所大肆诽谤的这个国家的巨大进步。
    第六个五年计划中所包括的和平利用原子能、发展自动化、提高技术、发展各种形式的教育等宏伟的计划，不光引起法国知识界的称赞。这些计划向工人阶级表明，摆脱了危机和矛盾的社会主义经济的蓬勃发展，必然会带来人民群众的文化的空前繁荣。它们表明，在向共产主义前进的过程中，全面发展的、拥有一切文化财富和科学知识的新型的人是如何在形成。
    跟法国这方面的现状相比，这是一个多么鲜明的对照，在法国，没有足够的工程师，统治集团经常摧残科学，青年研究者生活在贫困的条件中，教育的民主改革被长期地搁置起来！
    法国共产党人在本国是真正的人道主义的代表，他们引以自豪的是：他们在1920年响应了列宁的号召，认为必须进行革命的社会改造以保障祖国和人民的未来。
    法国共产党在保卫工人阶级的历史利益的时候，同时也在寸步不让地为争取满足劳动人民在经济和政治方面的迫切要求而斗争。他们站在保卫和平的最前列，这支保卫和平的大军团结着社会地位不同和信仰不同的男女。法国人民知道，苏联在争取维护和平、争取国家和国家之间共处原则的胜利、争取保障欧洲和全世界的集体安全、争取根据德国人民本身的利益和它的邻邦的利益解决统一德国问题的斗争中坚定不移地采取的步骤的全部意义。
    由于社会主义阵营和为和平而斗争的其他国家的力量日益增长，我国人民对苏联的感激和同情从来没有像现在这样深厚，我国人民从来没有像今天这样坚定地相信避免战争是可能的。（经久不息的掌声）
    法国共产党人忠实于法国的真正的民族利益和无产阶级国际主义精神，它曾经多年地反对在越南的肮脏战争。他们为争取承认阿尔及利亚国家的实际存在、争取建立把自由和平等的人民联合在一起的真正的法兰西联邦而斗争。
    为了保卫人民群众的利益，为了维护和平和祖国的未来，法国共产党始终不渝地为建立工人阶级的一致行动而努力。他们指出了参加社会党人和共产党人联合斗争的特殊重要性以及由于这种联合斗争而取得的初步成果的重要性。
    正是在这种条件下，法国共产党的威信提高了，并且在1月2日的议会选举中取得了巨大的胜利。（经久不息的掌声）。
    法国资产阶级的报纸、广播电台和受美国人指挥的一切肮脏的宣传机构，长期以来徒劳地散布对苏联、对共产主义思想和法国共产党的谎言和诽谤。有人徒劳地对我们采取镇压行动，捏造一切可能的所谓阴谋，企图分裂工人运动，和这同时，他们还弹着这种滥调：“共产党注定要被消灭，他们已经开始退却了”。大多数调班的政府的首脑徒劳地到华盛顿去表白自己的能力和决心，说要在法国消灭共产主义，从而无意中显露出他们对美帝国主义者的依赖。和过去比较起来，工人阶级对法国共产党的信任程度更大了。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    选举结果表明，人民希望对苏联实行和平政策，他们再不许把他们拖到大西洋集团的侵略政策中去。帝国主义势力对法国选举的结果公开表示他们痛苦的失望。
    为了制止反对缓和国际紧张局势的那些人的阴谋，为了粉碎重新抬头的法西斯分子的企图和保证社会的进步，必须继续和加强争取法国工人阶级的团结一致的斗争。
    最近时期，社会党和共产党的立场在很多问题上接近起来了。
    例如，必须指出这样一个事实，参加法国议会代表团访问了苏联的社会党议员在回国以后坚信，苏联领导人和人民都热望和平。
    不单是共产党，社会党也要求迅速熄灭阿尔及利亚的战火，并且和平解决同北非局势有关的一切问题。
    社会党人和共产党人共同进行斗争，争取满足劳动人民的某些经济要求、保护和争取扩大民主自由、争取恢复教育和国家的非宗教性质。
    早在1936年，当人民阵线在法国取得初次胜利的时候，法国共产党就向工人阶级和人民说明，在十九世纪起了必要的和先进作用的民主，并没有全部发挥自己全部的潜力，而人民阵线在这方面就是一个新的进步。
    法国共产党在1945年号召工人阶级和人民参加争取新的、摆脱托辣斯的控制的民主的斗争，工人阶级和它的组织在这一斗争中必须起决定性的作用。
    法国共产党的代表在1946年11月18日向英国“泰晤士报”发表的谈话中根据全世界民主和社会主义所获得的成就声明说：法国可以“确定一条不同于俄国共产党人所走的通向社会主义的道路”，还谈到：根据列宁的理论，“这些道路对于每一个国家必然是不相同的”。我们当时说过：“我们一向认为并且说过：富有光荣传统的法国人民自己将会找到自己的走向更为民主、进步和社会正义的道路。”
    但是，历史证明：没有斗争、没有以共产主义先锋队为首的工人阶级的领导就不可能取得进步。历史还教导我们，如果说通向社会主义的道路变得较为容易，那么我们要把这件事归功于伟大的十月社会主义革命，归功于使得历史车轮加速转动的苏联劳动人民的英雄主义和忘我精神。（掌声）
    为了便于实现自己的侵略政策，美国帝国主义者对这种谈话的回答是迫使法国共产党人退出政府，并且排除他们参加本国的政治生活。
    但是人民群众越来越了解到，共产党人的观点是正确的。他们越来越赞同共产党人的观点。
    法国共产党依靠群众的支持，将要在争取社会进步、和平和民族尊严的斗争中，始终不渝地执行争取工人阶级的团结和民主力量的联盟的政策。
    法国共产党受到光荣的苏联共产党的丰富经验的鼓舞；苏联共产党向全世界无产阶级指出了目标，它给予法国共产党的帮助在法国共产党的整个历史过程中是无可估量的。苏联共产党永远是坚持原则、坚定不移地忠实于马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的伟大思想的榜样。（掌声）
    依照苏联共产党的榜样，法国共产党过去曾经始终不渝地力求维护马克思列宁主义的科学理论的纯洁性，而且今后也将努力这样做。依照苏联共产党的榜样，法国共产党过去曾经为自己的队伍的团结、为在党内生活中运用列宁主义原则以及在工人运动中反对马克思主义的敌人和机会主义分子而进行了斗争，今后它也将进行这种斗争。
    依照苏联共产党的榜样，法国共产党将永远关心他们的人民的幸福。他们将进行斗争，保证法国人民有一个同他们的伟大的革命传统相称的未来，他们将为法国今后的生存而斗争，因为帝国主义的政策使法国作为一个大国的存在成了问题。
    引导苏联人民走向共产主义胜利的苏联共产党万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    全体无产阶级者的国际大团结万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    共产主义万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，全体起立。）
              （原载2月18日苏联“真理报”）（新华社）
