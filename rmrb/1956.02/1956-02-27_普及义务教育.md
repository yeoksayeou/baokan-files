    Popularizing Compulsory Education
    The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967 clearly proposes "popularizing primary school compulsory education in 7 or 12 years, depending on local conditions." This is a program of great significance.
    Over the past six years, China's primary school education has greatly developed. By 1955, there were 510,000 primary schools nationwide, a 47.3% increase compared to 1949, with an average of 2.1 primary schools per township nationwide. The number of primary school students (including over-aged students) was more than 53 million, a 117.3% increase compared to 1949. The number of primary school students (including over-aged students) accounted for 75.7% of the nation's school-age children, and some cities are already close to universal primary education. This fact fully demonstrates the Party and the government's concern for the new generation.
    However, the current primary education undertaking is still not adapted to the pace of socialist construction and socialist transformation. China not only still has a large number of illiterate people, but also a large number of school-age children who are not enrolled in school, with some areas having an enrollment rate of only 27.66% of school-age children. Therefore, while vigorously carrying out the movement to eliminate illiteracy, we must systematically accelerate the popularization of compulsory education.
    The popularization of compulsory education is necessary because: to promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, it is not only necessary to have a large number of technical cadres, but also to require that the general workers and farmers engaged in production have a certain level of cultural and technical knowledge. The popularization of compulsory education is to enable everyone in the new generation to receive the necessary basic education and become well-rounded new people, who possess a dialectical materialist worldview, communist morality, systematic basic scientific knowledge, understand the basic principles of industrial and agricultural production, have the skills to use simple production tools, have a healthy physique, and have an interest in and the ability to appreciate art. That is to say, the popularization of compulsory education is a necessary condition for building a socialist society, and it is also a necessary measure to fundamentally change the historically backward cultural state of our country. It can create a broad foundation for the development of the political, economic, and cultural aspects of all ethnic groups, and create favorable conditions for the more rapid development of social productive forces.
    The economic and cultural development of our country is very uneven. Therefore, we must, in accordance with the specific conditions of each region, divide the areas and periods, and gradually popularize compulsory education in 7 or 12 years. In economically developed areas with a relatively high enrollment rate of school-age children (for example, reaching 80% or more) and where there is no shortage of teachers, primary school compulsory education can be implemented in the next one or two years. In areas with poor conditions, the development of primary school education should be accelerated, conditions should be actively created, and efforts should be made to popularize primary school compulsory education successively during the Second Five-Year Plan period. In order to meet the requirements of the country's socialist industrialization, it is also possible to consider popularizing junior high school education on the basis of popularizing primary school education in a certain range, such as in municipalities directly under the central government and provincial-level cities (including industrial cities). These cities are where industries are located, and industrial production and various construction undertakings directly serving industrial production have higher cultural requirements, so junior high school education should be popularized.
    According to socialist principles, the national economy should develop in proportion, and the state must invest in various construction undertakings in a certain proportion. For a considerable period, the state's construction will focus on industry, mainly heavy industry. Popularizing compulsory education requires a huge amount of funding. If this funding is entirely solved by state budget allocations when the state's financial resources are not very sufficient, it will not only reduce investment in industry, thereby affecting the speed of socialist industrialization, but also delay the implementation of compulsory education because state allocations cannot fully meet the needs. This is contrary to the fundamental interests of the state and the people. Therefore, to popularize compulsory education in our country, we must give full play to the enthusiasm of the people in running schools and rely on the strength of the masses to assist the government in overcoming financial difficulties. Therefore, schools in cities should charge appropriate fees, while rural primary schools should basically be run by agricultural production cooperatives.
    The people of our country have always had a fine tradition of running schools themselves. Since the national liberation, the people's material lives have improved, and the masses have a high level of enthusiasm for running schools for the education of their children. Although public primary schools have greatly developed since liberation, this still cannot meet the masses' demand for sending their children to school. As a result, the number of schools run by the masses has increased year by year. Due to the erroneous measure of taking over privately-run primary schools once adopted in 1952, the enthusiasm of the masses in running schools was damaged. After 1953, the advocacy of schools run by the masses was re-emphasized, and privately-run primary schools gradually developed again. According to incomplete statistics in 1955, there were 27,833 privately-run primary schools nationwide, with 1,767,252 students enrolled. Guizhou Province, which is a relatively underdeveloped province in China in terms of economy and culture, also has 4,760 privately-run primary schools, with 249,144 students enrolled. This fact fully shows that running schools by the masses is not only necessary but also possible.
    It should be pointed out that although privately-run primary schools have been increasing year by year in recent years, the development is not very large. This is mainly because the education departments are not active enough in implementing the central government's policy of running schools by the masses, and there is only general advocacy without specific guidance. If the education departments can provide timely specific guidance and assistance to privately-run primary schools, the development of privately-run primary schools may be greater.
    With the development of socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperativization, and with the improvement and elevation of the people's material lives, the possibility of the people running schools will also increase day by day. Some people believe that charging fees and having agricultural production cooperatives run schools are not in line with the "obligation" principle of compulsory education. This view is one-sided and incorrect. Popularizing compulsory education is a cause of the state and also a cause of the masses. The basic purpose of popularizing compulsory education is to enable everyone in the new generation to receive the education that citizens must receive, so that they can become well-rounded members of socialist society. As for whether it is free or not, it depends on the state's financial resources. According to the specific conditions of our country's transition period, relying on the masses to assist the state in implementing compulsory education when the state needs to concentrate its main strength on giving priority to the development of industry is in line with the long-term interests of the state and the people, and it is also the most reliable way to popularize compulsory education as soon as possible.
    Popularizing compulsory education is a major event. The Party committees and governments of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should supervise and guide the relevant departments to make overall plans for popularizing compulsory education, conduct a thorough survey of the number and distribution of school-age children, divide school districts according to the distribution of school-age children and natural and transportation conditions, formulate plans for the distribution of school networks, and vigorously strengthen the publicity of popularizing compulsory education, mobilizing the people and the forces of factories, mines, enterprises, organs, and people's organizations to work together to achieve universal education.

### 普及义务教育

    普及义务教育
    1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）明确地提出“按照各地情况，分别在7年或者12年内普及小学义务教育”。这是一条具有重大意义的纲领。
    六年来，我国的小学教育有了很大的发展。到1955年，全国小学已有51万所，比1949年增长了47.3％，全国平均每个乡有2.1所小学。小学在校学生数为5，300多万人，比1949年增长了117.3％。小学在校学生（包括超龄学生在内）数占全国学龄儿童的75.7％，有些市已经接近普及小学教育。这一事实充分说明了党和政府对新生一代的关怀。
    但是，现在小学教育事业同社会主义建设及社会主义改造的速度相比，仍是不相适应的。我国现在不仅还有众多的文盲，而且还有大量的学龄儿童没有入学，个别地区入学儿童仅占学龄儿童的27.66％。因此，在大力开展扫除文盲运动的同时，我们必须有计划地加快普及义务教育。
    普及义务教育之所以必要是因为：要促进工业和农业生产的发展，不仅需要大批技术干部，而且还要求从事生产的一般工人和农民也都有一定的文化技术水平。普及义务教育就是要使新生一代人人都受到必要的基础教育，成为全面发展的新人，他们具有辩证唯物主义世界观、共产主义道德，有系统的科学基础知识，明白工农业生产的基本原理，有运用简单生产工具的技能，有健康的体质，爱好艺术的兴趣和欣赏艺术的能力。这就是说，普及义务教育是建设社会主义社会的一个必要的条件，也是从根本上改变我国文化落后的历史面貌的必要措施，它能够为发展各民族人民的政治、经济和文化创造广阔的基础，为社会生产力的更迅速的发展创造有利的条件。
    我国经济和文化的发展是很不平衡的。因此我们必须按照各地的具体条件，分区分期，分别在7年或者12年内逐步普及义务教育。在经济发达、学龄儿童入学率比较高（比如说达到80％以上），而又不缺少师资的地方，在最近一、二年内就可以实施小学义务教育。在条件较差的地区，应当加快小学教育事业的发展，积极创造条件，争取在第二个五年计划期间先后普及小学义务教育。为了适应国家的社会主义工业化的要求，还可以考虑在一定范围内，比如说在直辖市和省辖市（包括工业城市），在普及小学教育的基础上普及初中教育。这些城市是工业所在，工业生产和直接为工业生产服务的各项建设事业，对文化的要求较高，因此应该普及初中教育。
    按照社会主义的原则，国民经济要按比例发展，国家对各项建设事业必须按照一定的比例投资。在一个相当长的时期内，国家建设是以工业，主要是重工业建设为重点。普及义务教育需要一笔巨大的经费。在国家财力不很充足的情况下，这笔经费如果完全由国家预算拨款来解决，就不仅要削减工业方面的投资，以致影响社会主义工业化的速度，而且因为国家拨款不能全部满足需要，势必推迟实行普及义务教育的时间。这是同国家和人民的根本利益相违背的。因此，在我国普及义务教育就要充分发挥人民群众办学的积极性，依靠群众的力量协助政府克服经费的困难。因此在城市的学校要适当收费，而乡村小学基本上应该由农业生产合作社办理。
    我国人民群众历来有自己办学的优良传统。在全国解放以后，人民的物质生活已经有所改善，广大群众为了自己子女的学习，办学的积极性是很高的。解放以后公立小学虽然有了很大发展，但这还是不能满足群众送子女入学的要求。于是群众自己办学逐年增多。由于1952年一度采取了接办民办小学的错误措施，群众办学的积极性曾经受了损伤。1953年以后重新提倡群众办学，民办小学才又逐年有所发展。根据1955年不完全的统计，全国共有民办小学27，833所，在校学生达到1，767，252人。贵州省是我国经济和文化比较不发达的一个省份，也有民办小学4，760所，在校学生达到249，144人。这一事实充分说明，群众办学不但是必要的，也是可能的。
    应当指出，这几年民办小学虽然在逐年增加，但是发展并不很大，这主要是由于教育部门对贯彻执行中央提出的群众办学的方针还不够积极，只有一般号召，没有具体指导。如果教育部门对民办小学能够及时予以具体指导和帮助，民办小学的发展还可能大一些。
    随着社会主义工业化和农业合作化事业的发展，随着人民物质生活的改善和提高，人民群众办学的可能也就会日益增大。有人认为收费和由农业生产合作社办学不符合普及义务教育的“义务”原则，这种看法是片面的，不对的。普及义务教育是国家的事业，同时也是群众的事业。普及义务教育的基本目的，是使新生一代人人都受到国民必须受到的教育，使他们成为社会主义社会中全面发展的成员。至于免费与否，决定于国家的财力。根据我国过渡时期的具体条件，在国家需要集中主要力量优先发展工业的情况下，依靠群众协助国家实施义务教育，这是符合于国家和人民的长远利益的，而且也是早日普及义务教育的最可靠办法。
    普及义务教育是一件大事。各省市、自治区党委和政府应当督促和指导有关部门作好普及义务教育的全面规划，切实调查学龄儿童的人数及其分布情况，根据学龄儿童的分布和自然、交通等条件，划分学区，制定学校网的分布计划，并且大力加强普及义务教育的宣传，动员人民群众以及厂矿、企业、机关、人民团体的力量，共同为实现普及教育而努力。
