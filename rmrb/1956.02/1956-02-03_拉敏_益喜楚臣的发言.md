    Lhamin Yeshe Tsultrim's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I feel very honored to be able to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference!
    Our great motherland, under the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the beloved great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, is carrying out the great cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction. In the past few years, brilliant achievements have been made in economic and cultural construction. The complete and over-fulfilled accomplishment of the first three years' tasks of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, through the efforts of the people of the whole country, has created extremely favorable conditions for the completion of the various tasks in the next two years, and at the same time has laid a good foundation for the further planned development of the national economy and the gradual improvement of the people's lives in the future.
    With the growing development of our motherland's socialist construction, the various tasks in our Tibet region are also constantly progressing and developing with the strong support and assistance of all fraternal ethnic groups, especially the Han people. Tremendous changes are taking place in all aspects of Tibetan society, and the Tibetan people are embarking on the road to a happy life.
    Last year, while the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni and their entourage were in the interior, they discussed and determined many major issues concerning work in Tibet under the care and education of Chairman Mao, and the State Council's seventh plenary meeting discussed and made official resolutions on them. After they returned to Tibet, they actively led all the monks and lay people of Tibet in making great efforts to implement the various resolutions of the State Council and achieved many results. Regarding the work of establishing the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, a preparatory office was established in September last year, and various preparatory work was actively carried out. The Tibetan local government, the Panchen Kampot會議廳 Committee, and the People's Liberation Committee of the Qamdo Region all appointed a number of personnel to participate in the work of the preparatory office. Everyone was able to promote the spirit of democratic consultation and work conscientiously, thereby further strengthening the unity of all parties. This laid a certain foundation for the smooth implementation of various tasks after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in the future.
    In October last year, the highways from Lhasa to Shigatse and from Shigatse to Gyantse were opened, closely connecting several major cities in Tibet, facilitating internal transportation in Tibet, and providing favorable conditions for further developing Tibet's political, economic, and cultural construction.
    In July 1954, severe floods occurred in Shigatse, Gyantse, and other places, and the houses and farmlands of many people were completely washed away by the floods, and the vast number of people were reduced to begging. Thanks to the care and assistance of the Central Government, we vigorously carried out disaster relief work for a year from the winter of 1954 to the autumn of 1955. In addition to distributing disaster relief grain and funds to stabilize the lives of the affected people, we used work as a form of relief to repair the Shigatse-Gyantse highway, vigorously organized and restored production, and built houses, so that all the affected people were able to resettle and engage in production. In addition, the whole region had a bumper harvest last year, and now all the disaster victims have basically returned to normal life.
    According to the decision of the State Council, the macadam road built in Shigatse was completed at the end of last year. The survey project of the Nianchu River dam has been completed, and planned construction will be possible this year. At the same time, the construction of a large bridge on the Nianchu River has begun. After the completion of this bridge, it will eliminate many difficulties for the people and further facilitate transportation in Shigatse.
    The achievement of the above achievements is due to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the selfless assistance of the people of all fraternal ethnic groups, the close and united leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and the close cooperation and active efforts of the People's Liberation Army and working personnel stationed in Tibet with the Tibetan people. In the future, we will further strengthen the unity between fraternal ethnic groups and within Tibet, and strive for assistance from all parties, and work hard to further improve the various tasks in Tibet.
    Finally, I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's political report and fully agree with Vice Chairman Li Jishen's work report.

    拉敏·益喜楚臣的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我这次能够出席中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议，感到非常光荣！
    我们伟大的祖国，在中国共产党和各族人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席英明正确领导下，正进行着伟大的社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业。过去几年来，在经济、文化建设事业中，已取得了辉煌成就。发展国民经济的第一个五年计划在全国人民努力下，前三年度任务的全部完成和超额完成，为后两年度各项任务的完成创造了极为有利的条件，同时为今后进一步有计划的发展国民经济，逐步改善人民生活打下了良好的基础。
    随着我们祖国社会主义建设事业的日益发展，在全国各兄弟民族特别是汉民族人民的大力支持和帮助下，我们西藏地区的各项工作也在不断的进步和发展着，西藏社会各方面正在发生着巨大的变化，西藏人民正在走上幸福生活的道路。
    去年达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼及随从官员在内地期间，在毛主席的关怀教育下，商讨确定了关于西藏工作上的许多重大问题，并经国务院第七次全体会议讨论做了正式决议。他们返回西藏以后，积极领导西藏全体僧俗人民，为实现国务院的各项决议而做了巨大的努力，获得了许多成绩。关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作，已于去年9月间成立了筹备处，积极进行了各项筹备工作，西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会和昌都地区人民解放委员会均指派了若干人员参加了筹备处的工作。大家在工作中都能发扬民主协商的精神，认真办事，从而进一步加强了各方面的团结。为今后西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后顺利地推行各项工作打下了一定的基础。
    去年10月间，修通了由拉萨至日喀则、日喀则至江孜的公路，将西藏的几个较大城市紧密地连接在一起，便利了西藏内部的交通，为进一步发展西藏的政治、经济、文化建设事业提供了有利的条件。
    1954年7月，日喀则、江孜等地发生了严重水灾，有许多人民的房屋、田地全部被洪水冲没，广大人民流于乞讨之中；由于中央的关怀和帮助，我们从1954年冬至1955年秋共一年的时间中，大力进行了救灾工作，除发放了救灾粮款，安定受灾人民的生活外，以工代赈修通了日江公路，大力组织和恢复生产修筑房屋等工作，使全部受灾的人民得以重新安居，进行生产；加之去年全区丰收，现在全部灾民已基本上恢复了正常生活。
    根据国务院的决定，在日喀则修筑的碎石马路已于去年年底修成。年楚河的水坝勘察工程已全部完成，今年将可以有计划的施工；同时，在年楚河上修筑的大桥工程已开始施工，这一桥梁修成后，将免除人民的许多困难，更加便利日喀则市的交通。
    上述各项成绩的获得，是由于中国共产党和毛主席英明领导，各兄弟民族人民的无私援助，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼亲密团结领导，进藏人民解放军和工作人员与藏族人民亲密合作，积极努力的结果。今后我们将进一步做好兄弟民族间和西藏内部的团结，努力争取各方面的帮助，为进一步做好西藏的各项工作而努力。
    最后，我衷心的拥护周总理的政治报告并完全同意李济深副主席的工作报告。
