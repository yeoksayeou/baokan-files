Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has held banquets at Huairen Hall for several consecutive days, entertaining the committee members and attendees of the Second Plenary Session in batches. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China and Honorary Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, attended the banquets. Before the banquets, they met and shook hands with each committee member and attendee, and engaged in conversations with many of them.

The banquets were held on the evenings of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 6th respectively. Chairman Mao Zedong attended each banquet.

Also attending the banquets were CPPCC National Committee Vice-Chairmen Dong Biwu, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, He Xiangning, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Zhang Bojun, Chen Jiageng, Baurhan, Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and Li Xiannian.

Each banquet was filled with the warmth of the great family of the motherland, an atmosphere of joy, harmony, and unity. Representatives from various parties and organizations, workers, farmers, people from the scientific, engineering technology, education, cultural and artistic, medical and health, news and publishing, industrial and commercial, and religious circles, as well as representatives from various ethnic minorities, social relief organizations, peace and friendship associations, specially invited individuals, overseas Chinese, and representatives from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, continuously surrounded Chairman Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Chen Yun, and other leading state officials, proposing toasts to them. Chairman Mao Zedong clinked glasses with everyone who offered a toast. When Huang Demao, a special-class industrial labor model from Anshan Iron and Steel, toasted Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao said to him kindly, "You are a steelworker, you should eat more vegetables and rice, so you have the strength to produce more." Huang Demao replied with emotion, "I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words and work hard in production." When Gao Fengzhi, a farmer from Heilongjiang Province, toasted Chairman Mao, he held Chairman Mao's hand tightly and said: "Chairman Mao, our benefactor who liberated us, I guarantee to you: I will never be arrogant or complacent, I will always respond to the call of the Party and you, and I will always be a leader in agricultural production." Many Tibetan and Mongolian representatives presented Hadas to Chairman Mao Zedong. Many artists performed various artistic programs in front of Chairman Mao Zedong, including new songs, Peking Opera, Xiang Opera, Han Opera, Qin Opera, Dian Opera, Gui Opera, Shanghai Opera, Jin Opera, Pu Opera, Hebei Bangzi, Sichuan Opera and other local operas, Sichuan Qingyin, and crosstalk; and the famous Uygur dancer Cambalhan from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region performed excellent Uygur dances. The Mongolian poet Na. Sayin Choktu recited a new poem "I Hold Chairman Mao's Hand" on the spot. After the recitation, he walked up to Chairman Mao, held Chairman Mao's hand for a long time, and leaned tightly into Chairman Mao's arms. Yao Kefang, a member of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association, also performed outstanding ventriloquism at the meeting.

The committee members and attendees who participated in the banquet regarded seeing Chairman Mao, shaking hands with Chairman Mao, and talking with Chairman Mao as lifelong happiness and supreme glory. Some people were so excited after seeing Chairman Mao that they couldn't sleep all night. They expressed that they would transform Chairman Mao Zedong's concern for them into strength, and that in the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they would unite the people of the whole country, work hard, study actively, and strive to complete the socialist construction of the motherland.
