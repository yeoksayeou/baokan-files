    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I have listened to Premier Zhou's political report, Vice Chairman Li Jishen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, President Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the upsurge of the socialist revolution, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and President Dong Biwu's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries, and I fully endorse them.
    Currently, our country is entering a high tide of socialist transformation. The people of the whole country are jubilantly marching towards socialism. Capitalist industry and commerce, along with the upsurge of agricultural and handicraft cooperation, have also entered a high tide of transformation, which will accelerate our socialist construction. In the past few years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government, industrialists and businessmen have undergone gradual transformation through various forms of state capitalism, and have assisted the government in completing various tasks. Facts have proved that this is no longer sufficient. The Party and the government, while promoting agricultural and handicraft cooperation, have adopted the method of joint state-private ownership of entire industries for capitalist industry and commerce. For us industrialists and businessmen, this is not only an opportunity to learn but also an opportunity for us to transform into glorious self-reliant laborers.
    I feel very happy and fortunate because we have the opportunity, in this high tide of transformation, to gradually understand the laws of social development, master our own destiny, transform our own thinking and decadent lives, become laborers of tomorrow, and have the opportunity to make a fresh start.
    But I also feel ashamed because I have done too little in the past and have not played a good role. In addition to overcoming past shortcomings in the future, I would like to make the following sincere guarantees:
    First, I will definitely obey the leadership of the local Party and government and the supervision of the working masses, be conscientious and responsible, and do a good job in production and management.
    Second, I will definitely study hard, learn socialist management methods, transform my own thinking, and become a self-reliant laborer.
    Third, I will actively and sincerely respond to the call of the Party and the government and do everything possible to promote the business community to assist the government in completing various tasks during the period of socialist construction and transformation, and happily enter socialism.
    Finally, I hope that all committee members and comrades can give me enthusiastic help and guidance in my thinking.

    王德舆的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    这次听了周总理的政治报告、李济深副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告、郭沫若院长关于在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告、陈叔通副主席关于资本主义工商业社会主义改造问题的报告和董必武院长关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告，我完全拥护。
    目前我国正进入一个社会主义改造高潮中，全国人民欢欣鼓舞的奔向社会主义，资本主义工商业也随着农业、手工业的合作化高潮，进入了改造的高潮，这将加速我国社会主义建设事业。过去几年，工商业者在毛主席、中国共产党和人民政府领导下，通过各种国家资本主义形式进行了逐步的改造，并协助政府完成了各项任务，事实证明这已是不够的了。党和政府在农业和手工业合作化的同时，对资本主义工商业采取全行业合营，对我们工商业者来说，不但是一个学习的机会，而且是给我们转变为光荣的自食其力的劳动者的机会。
    我感到非常愉快和幸福，因为我们有可能在这个改造高潮中，来逐步认清社会发展规律，掌握自己的命运，改造自己的思想和腐朽生活，成为明天的劳动者，有可能重新做人的机会。
    但又感到惭愧，因为自己过去做的事太少，没有起到很好作用。今后除了克服过去的缺点外，提出如下诚恳的保证：
    第一，我一定服从当地党政领导和工人群众的监督，守职尽责，搞好生产经营。
    第二，一定努力学习，学会社会主义经营管理方法，改造自己的思想，成为自食其力的劳动者。
    第三，积极的诚恳的响应党和政府的号召，并尽一切力量推动工商界协助政府完成社会主义建设和改造时期的各项任务，愉快的进入社会主义。
    最后希望各位委员和各位同志能在思想上给我以热情的帮助和指教。
