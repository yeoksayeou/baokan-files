Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 24th: The youth and children of Yulin Special District in northern Shaanxi, a key area for soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, have recently proposed a new plan to build a "Communist Youth League Great Green Wall" sand prevention forest belt in order to welcome the Five-Province (Autonomous Region) Youth Afforestation Conference. The plan stipulates that from 1956 to 1965, a sand prevention forest belt of more than 10,000 li will be built inside and outside the ancient Great Wall to prevent the rolling southward invasion of sand and reduce the sediment in the Yellow River.

Recently, youth afforestation conferences have been widely held in various counties of the Yulin Special District to summarize local experiences and study the plan for building the "Communist Youth League Great Green Wall" sand prevention forest belt. They decided that every year, at least one sand prevention forest belt, 1,300 li long, should be built inside and outside the Great Wall. This year, about 80% of young people and children will participate in afforestation activities.

The Yulin area is dry and rainless, with frequent winds in all seasons. The flowing sand has been invading southward year by year, turning an area of 270,000 square li from Fuguxian in the east to Dingbianxian in the west into a desert, and causing a large amount of flowing sand to enter rivers such as the Wuding River and be discharged into the Yellow River, bringing disasters to the lower reaches of the Yellow River. In the past 5 years, during the afforestation season, at least 60,000 people have participated in afforestation activities inside and outside the Great Wall in the Yulin area. This has resulted in a green forest wall of 4,000 li now appearing in the boundless yellow desert. In Jingbian County within this area, after creating a 160-li long and 3-li wide sand prevention young forest, about 20,000 mu of farmland has been withdrawn due to the fixation of flowing sand, and good farmland has been protected.

    榆林青少年为迎接五省青年造林大会
    提出营造“共青团万里绿长城”防沙林带新规划
    新华社西安24日电　黄河中游水土保持工作重点区的陕北榆林专区的青年和少年，为迎接五省（自治区）青年造林大会，最近提出营造“共青团万里绿长城”的防沙林带的新规划。规划规定自1956年到1965年，要在古长城内外营造一座长达万里以上的防沙林带，以阻止滚滚南侵的流沙，和减少黄河的泥沙。
    榆林专区各县最近普遍召开了青年造林大会，总结了各地经验，研究了营造“共青团万里绿长城”防沙林带的计划。他们决定每年要在长城内外至少营造一条长1，300华里的防沙林。今年将有80％左右的青年、少年参加造林活动。
    榆林地区干燥缺雨，四季多风，流沙逐年南侵，使东起府谷县西至定边县的27万平方华里地区变成沙漠，并且使大量流沙侵入无定河等河流，排入黄河，给黄河下游带来灾难。近5年来，每逢造林季节在榆林地区长城内外至少有60，000人参加造林活动。使一望无边的黄色沙漠中现在出现了一堵4，000里长的绿色林墙。这个区域内的靖边县境造成160里长、3里宽的防沙幼林以后，因流沙固定而退出的耕地和受到保护的良田就有两万亩左右。
