    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice Chairman Li Jishen's report on the work of the conference, and the reports by Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, and Dong Biwu on intellectuals, the transformation of industry and commerce, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.
    Not long ago, the Party Central Committee convened a conference on the issue of intellectuals, and Premier Zhou gave a report on the issue of intellectuals. This session of the CPPCC also focuses on discussing the issue of intellectuals. From this, it can be seen how much the Party and the government value and care for us intellectuals. We feel infinitely encouraged and express our heartfelt gratitude.
    At present, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and industry and commerce in our country has entered a high tide and has achieved astonishing and great victories. The first Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. In this high tide of socialist revolution, the tasks undertaken by us intellectuals in general, especially our scientific and technical personnel, are even more significant. We must form an alliance with workers and peasants and bring our socialist enthusiasm into full play.
    It is undeniable that our science and technology are generally backward. In order to successfully complete the socialist construction of our country, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that by the end of the third Five-Year Plan, the scientific and technological departments urgently needed by our country must be able to approach the advanced level of the world. Now, the State Planning Commission is actively working with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various ministries to formulate a long-term plan for the development of science in our country in the next 12 years. Ensuring the realization of this plan is primarily the major responsibility of our scientific and technical personnel under the leadership of the Party and the government, and it is also our glorious task.
    As Premier Zhou pointed out in his political report, our country's existing scientific and technical strength, whether in terms of quantity, professional level, or political consciousness, is still not adapted to the needs of socialist construction. Like many of the scientific and technical personnel present here, the vast majority are over 40 years old and grew up in the old society. Therefore, it is inevitable that they have some bourgeois viewpoints and individualistic tendencies. Although most of our scientific and technical knowledge was learned from capitalist countries, due to various reasons, most people do not fully understand the development of science and technology in capitalist countries in the past ten years, let alone the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. We are very excited to hear Premier Zhou say in his political report that the Party and the government will take a series of effective measures to continuously help us improve our political consciousness and professional level. I believe that the vast majority of our scientific and technical personnel express extreme welcome to such measures. Here, I venture to put forward a few immature opinions, hoping that the relevant departments can help us to solve them.
    1. The vast majority of our scientific and technical personnel are willing to learn Marxism-Leninism well and apply it to practical work. However, Marxism-Leninism is not a simple science. The general learning methods of the past, which relied solely on self-reading of documents, group discussions, and listening to reports, are not easy to enable us to learn well. The biggest regret is that there are many difficult and important issues that cannot be thoroughly and clearly answered. We hope to get greater help in this regard.
    2. The advanced technology and science of the Soviet Union have played a huge role in the construction of our country, and the vast majority of our scientific and technical personnel are increasingly aware of its superiority and advanced nature. However, in the design standards and technical specifications of Soviet engineering construction, there are many regulations where we only know "what it is" but do not understand "why it is." Therefore, it is not easy to grasp correctly in practical applications. We hope that in the future, we can obtain sufficient information on these issues.
    3. We must catch up with the advanced level of world science in a not-too-long period of time, and the so-called "advanced level of world science" is constantly improving. Our government has also repeatedly called on us to learn the beneficial advantages of science and technology from all countries in the world. Therefore, we must be able to easily read and buy science and technology books and periodicals from major countries in the world. Otherwise, it will not be easy to understand the "world scientific level" and the advantages of science and technology in various countries.
    Finally, I hope and demand that all our intellectuals can gradually and continuously study Marxism-Leninism and advanced Soviet experience to improve their political consciousness and professional level, closely unite around the Party, and under the banner of Mao Zedong, contribute all their strength to accelerate the completion of our country's great socialist construction cause.

    蔡方荫的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，李济深副主席的会务工作报告，以及郭沫若，陈叔通，董必武三位副主席的关于知识分子、工商业改造和肃反的报告。
    在不久以前，党中央曾经召开了关于知识分子问题的会议，并由周总理作了关于知识分子问题的报告。我们政协这次会议又以讨论知识分子问题为一个重点。由是可见，党和政府对我们知识分子是如何地重视和关怀，我们觉得无限的振奋并表示衷心的感激。
    目前我国农业、手工业和工商业的社会主义改造已进入高潮并且取得了警人的伟大胜利。第一个五年计划将要提前和超额完成。在这个社会主义革命的高潮里，我们一般知识分子，特别是我们科学技术人员，所担负的任务，更加重大。我们一定要和工人农民结成联盟，发挥我们的社会主义积极性。
    无可讳言，我们的科学技术，一般是落后的。为了胜利完成我国的社会主义建设，我们伟大领袖毛主席指出，在第三个五年计划的末尾，我国急需的科学技术部门，必须能够接近世界的先进水平。现在国家计划委员会正在会同中国科学院和各部积极制定我国以后12年科学发展的远景规划。保证这个规划的实现，主要是我们科学技术人员在党和政府领导下的重大责任，也是我们的光荣的任务。
    如周总理在政治报告中所指出，我国现有的科学技术力量，无论在数量方面，在业务水平方面，在政治觉悟方面，都还不能适应社会主义建设的需要。像我们在座的许多科学技术人员，绝大多数的年龄都在40以上，都是在旧社会里成长的，因此，都不可避免地多少有些资产阶级的观点和个人主义的作风。我们的一点科学技术知识，虽然绝大部分是从资本主义国家学得来的，但是因种种关系，大部分人甚至对于资本主义国家科学技术的近十几年来的发展也未见得完全了解，至于苏联的先进经验，那就了解得更少了。我们很兴奋地听到周总理在政治报告中所说的，党和政府将采取一系列有效的措施，来不断地帮助我们提高政治觉悟和业务水平。我相信我们绝大多数的科学技术人员，对于这种措施是表示极端欢迎的。在这里我冒昧地提出几点不成熟的意见，希望有关部门能帮助我们来解决。
    一、我们绝大多数的科学技术人员都愿意学好马克思列宁主义，并且应用到实际工作中去。但是马克思列宁主义并不是一门简单的科学。像以往专靠自读文件、小组讨论和听取报告的一般学习方式是不容易使我们学得好的。最大的缺憾就是有许多疑难的重要的问题，得不到彻底明确的解答。我们希望在这方面能得到较大的帮助。
    二、苏联的先进技术科学在我国国家的建设中已经起了巨大的作用，我们绝大多数的科学技术人员也越来越切实地认识到它的优越性和先进性。但是在苏联工程建设的设计标准及技术规范中，有许多规定我们只知道它们的“所然”而不了解它们的“所以然”。因此在实际应用中就不容易正确掌握。我们希望今后能获得关于这些问题的充分资料。
    三、我们既须在不太长久的时间内很迅速地赶上世界科学的先进水平，而所谓“世界科学的先进水平”是在日益提高的，我们政府也曾一再号召我们要学习世界所有国家科学技术对于我们有益的优点。因此我们必须要能很容易地读到和买到世界各主要国家的科技书刊。否则“世界科学水平”和各国的科学技术的优点就不容易了解了。
    最后我希望并且要求我们所有的知识分子，能逐渐地、不断地学习马克思列宁主义和苏联先进经验，以提高政治觉悟和业务水平，紧密地团结在党的周围，并在毛泽东的旗帜下，贡献出一切力量，为加速完成我国的伟大社会主义建设事业而奋斗。
