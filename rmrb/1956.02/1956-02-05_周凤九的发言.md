    Chairman, Comrades, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    I fully agree with and support the reports of Premier Zhou and the four Vice-Premiers.
    Since the day our country announced its establishment to the world, it has opened a new page in the history of the oppressed peoples of the East. In this short period of more than six years, it has swept away the historical filth accumulated over thousands of years with overwhelming power, and opened up a new road to peaceful and happy life. It has not only restored the national economy that was destroyed by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, but also started the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Especially since 1953, our country has implemented the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in accordance with the goal of building socialism, and has achieved brilliant achievements, thus beginning to realize the long-cherished wishes of the people across the country for generations, making our country enjoy high prestige in the international arena, and making the people's material and cultural life greatly improved. All this has not only encouraged the people of the world, but also explained why our country and government have gained the trust and support of the people across the country, and the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world.
    In these six years, our country has been able to achieve such achievements and status, which has vividly and fully proved that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government can the people across the country be organized and planned to carry out large-scale construction, and can they show amazing enthusiasm and creativity on the labor front. Therefore, in our economic life, there has emerged a new law of development that is completely different from capitalism, and it has greatly demonstrated the great superiority of our people's democratic system. Our national system is guided by the thought of combining Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution; the superiority of this system fully proves that Marxism-Leninism has invincible power!
    At present, our country has achieved greater victories on all fronts in 1955. In industry, the vast majority of basic construction units and factories and mining enterprises have completed and overfulfilled the tasks stipulated in the state plan. In agriculture, the total output of cotton and grain has reached an unprecedented level in the history of our country. Especially after Chairman Mao made instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation, a new upsurge of the socialist mass movement has been set off in the vast rural areas, and many areas have basically realized semi-socialist agricultural cooperation. At the same time, the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts has also achieved comprehensive planning and specific arrangements. In addition, recently, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the "Draft National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967", which has aroused unparalleled excitement and unanimous support from the people across the country, and guarantees to realize or realize it ahead of schedule. All this has marked that our country has entered a new stage of the great socialist revolution.
    There is no doubt that socialist construction is the common cause of our 600 million people, and every Chinese person must contribute their greatest strength to serve the motherland and the people wholeheartedly. In the coming period, the tasks we shoulder will naturally be more arduous and heavier, but also very fortunate and glorious!
    I am an engineering technician from the old society. Since liberation, under the correct leadership, kind care, and education of the Chinese Communist Party, through a series of political movements and social reform movements, and through frequent study of theory, policies, and current affairs, as well as the practice of post work, I have not only realized all my dark past and the bright future of always following the Chinese Communist Party, but also deeply realized that in Chinese history, intellectuals have never been able to fully exert our learning and ability as since liberation, but only feel ashamed that our learning and ability are far behind the needs of the country; at the same time, I also feel that my ideological transformation work is far behind the objective reality. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report that the current new situation requires intellectuals across the country to strengthen self-education and self-ideological transformation, which is a very correct and timely instruction. In the future, we must overcome and eliminate all old and wrong ideological consciousness in our minds, so that our thinking conforms to the development of objective reality. In study, we must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and observe, analyze, and deal with problems from the standpoint of the working class, with a materialist viewpoint, and a dialectical method; at the same time, we must humbly learn from the advanced technology and advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so as to rapidly improve our technical and professional level. We must also strengthen unity, learn from each other, and closely contact the workers and peasants, obey the leadership of the Party, and systematically study science and technology, in order to rapidly develop our country's scientific and cultural undertakings and catch up with the world's advanced level within 12 years. In work, we should strengthen the concept of responsibility with a high sense of ownership, improve work efficiency, and take the initiative to actively do our job, complete and complete the tasks assigned by the state and the people ahead of schedule. Finally, we must actively participate in the current various practical activities of the production struggle and class struggle, and strive for the great and glorious cause of building socialism!

    周凤九的发言
    主席、各位同志、各位先生：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理和四位副主席的报告。
    我们的国家自从向全世界宣布成立那一天起，就在东方被压迫民族人民的历史上展开了新的一页。在这短短六年多的时间中，它以排山倒海的威力，扫除了几千年来积压下来的历史污垢，开辟着和平幸福生活的新道路，不仅恢复了被帝国主义和国民党反动派所破坏了的国民经济，而且开始了社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业。尤以从1953年开始，我们的国家已经按照建设社会主义的目标，实行了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，并且已经获得了辉煌的成就，从而开始实现全国人民多少世代以来梦寐以求的愿望，使我们的国家在国际上享有崇高的荣誉，使人民的物质生活和文化生活得到了很大的改善。这一切，不仅鼓舞了全世界的人民，而且也说明了我们的国家和政府为什么会得到全国人民的信任和拥护，并得到全世界爱好和平的人民的同情和支持。
    在这六年多的时间内，我们的国家能够取得这样的成就和地位，已生动而充分地证明只有在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下，全国人民才能够有组织、有计划地进行大规模的建设，才能够在劳动战线上表现出惊人的热情和创造的能力；因而在我们的经济生活中，就出现了与资本主义完全不同的新的发展规律，也就大大地显示了我国人民民主制度具有绝大的优越性。我们的国家制度是以马克思列宁主义和中国革命的实践相结合的思想为指导的；这个制度的优越性又充分地证明了马克思列宁主义具有无敌无比的力量！
    目前，我们国家由于1955年在各条战线上已经获得了更大的胜利，在工业方面，绝大多数基本建设单位和厂矿企业都完成和超额完成了国家计划规定的任务；在农业方面，棉、粮生产总量达到了我国历史上所未有过的水平，尤其是在毛主席作了“关于农业合作化问题”的指示以后，在广大的农村中掀起了一个新的社会主义群众运动的高潮，不少地区已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化；同时，国家对资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造，也做到了全面规划和具体安排；加之，最近，中国共产党中央又提出了“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案”，引起了全国人民无比的兴奋，一致拥护，并保证一一实现或提前实现。这一切，当已标志着我国已进入伟大社会主义革命一个新的阶段。
    毫无疑问，社会主义建设是我们6亿人民共同的事业，每一个中国人民都必须贡献出自己的最大力量全心全意地为祖国和人民服务。在今后时期中，我们所担负的任务自然是更为艰巨和繁重的，也是非常幸运和光荣的！
    我是一个从旧社会过来的工程技术人员。解放以来，在中国共产党正确的领导和亲切关怀、教育下，通过了一系列的政治运动和社会改革运动的锻炼，通过经常的理论、政策和时事的学习以及岗位工作的实践，不仅使我认识了自己所有阴暗的过去和永远跟着中国共产党走的光明前途，而且也使我深深体会到在中国历史上知识分子从来没有像解放以来这样能够充分发挥我们的所学、所能，而只有使自己很惭愧地感觉到所学、所能还大大地赶不上国家的需要；同时，也感觉到自我思想改造工作也远远地落后于客观的实际。周总理在报告中提出了：当前新的形势要求全国知识分子，必须加强自我教育、自我思想改造，这是非常正确而且及时的指示。我们今后在思想上必须克服和消灭所有旧的、错误的思想意识，使我们的思想符合于客观现实的发展。在学习上，必须认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，以工人阶级的立场，唯物的观点，辩证的方法来观察、分析事物和处理问题；同时，必须虚心学习苏联先进技术和先进经验，从而迅速地提高自己的技术、业务水平，我们还要加强团结，互相切磋，并紧密地联系工农群众，服从党的领导，有计划地钻研科学技术，以期迅速地发展我国科学文化事业，并在12年之内赶上世界先进的水平。在工作上，我们更应该以高度的主人翁态度，加强责任观念，提高工作效能，主动积极地做好岗位工作，完成和提前完成国家和人民所交付的任务。最后我们必须在积极参加当前生产斗争和阶级斗争的各项实践活动中，为建设社会主义伟大光荣的事业而奋斗！
