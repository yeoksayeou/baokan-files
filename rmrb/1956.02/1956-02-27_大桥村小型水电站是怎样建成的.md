How the Daqiao Village Small Hydropower Station Was Built
Sui Zhen, County Magistrate of Dunhua County, Jilin Province

In the past, in Dunhua County, Jilin Province, east of the city, near the Daqiao Village of the Changchun-Tumen Railway, there was a river dam made of willow branches and stones on the Sha River. During every flood season, this willow dam was always breached by floods, leaving the irrigation area along the river without water security, and many rice paddies were abandoned. In 1953, the local people's government allocated a large amount of funds to rebuild a steel-reinforced concrete gravity dam upstream of the old dam and widened the original channel, ensuring water supply for the Sha River irrigation area. In the past two years, more than 500 hectares of new and restored paddy fields have been created. The establishment of this dam has also created conditions for the construction of a hydroelectric power station. The water level difference between upstream and downstream of the dam is 3.5 meters, and the average flow rate is 18.5 cubic meters per second, which can generate 100 kilowatts.

In the spring of 1955, more than 80% of the 600 households in the six natural villages of Daqiao and Xinglong Villages near the dam participated in agricultural cooperatives. After cooperativization, the economic situation improved, and the farmers in these two villages urgently desired to further improve their material and cultural living standards and longed for the construction of a hydroelectric power station.

The Dunhua County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Committee, based on the demands of the masses, and under the guidance and assistance of the Ministry of Water Resources and the Jilin Provincial Water Resources Bureau, focused on piloting a rural small hydropower station in Daqiao Village.

The entire project plan for this small hydropower station was carried out in two phases. The first phase of the project included a power plant building, a wooden propeller-type water turbine (designed for 100 kilowatts), a 50-kilowatt generator, and a 3,300-volt transmission line project for the six natural villages of Daqiao and Xinglong Villages. This first phase of the project was completed on November 28, 1955, and power supply began on December 1. The second phase of the project included retrofitting a 100-kilowatt generator and building a 25-mile 15,000-volt high-voltage transmission line to expand the power supply range. This phase of the project is planned to be completed in the second half of this year. The total cost of the first phase of the project was 50,036.98 yuan, with an average construction cost of 1,000 yuan per kilowatt, of which 72% was invested by the state and 28% was raised by the masses. According to cost accounting, electricity for lighting (because there are no electricity meter devices, it is temporarily charged monthly according to wattage) costs 2 to 2.5 fen per watt per month. For example, a 30-watt lamp costs 7 jiao and 5 fen per month, which is slightly higher than in large cities. Electricity for power costs 3 fen and 4 li per kilowatt-hour.

After the small hydropower station was officially put into operation, it brought many benefits to the farmers in the six natural villages of Daqiao and Xinglong Villages and set an example for the gradual implementation of electrification in the county's rural areas:

One, it promoted the technological reform of agriculture. The 12 agricultural cooperatives in Daqiao and Xinglong Villages have jointly purchased a 7.5-horsepower electric motor and installed a complete set of rice milling machines and flour milling machines. Each machine can grind 60 jin of flour or hull 300 jin of rice per hour, saving 15 livestock for agricultural production. At the same time, an electric chaff cutter has also been installed, and it is planned to install 5 more, each of which can cut 600 jin of grass per hour. These 12 cooperatives also plan to establish an electric pumping station this spring, which can turn 70 hectares of dry land into paddy fields, and this spring will first turn 40 hectares of dry land into paddy fields, which can increase grain production by 70 tons. In addition, they also plan to install electric rice threshers, cotton gins, electric incubators, establish simple lumber mills, try using electric lights to kill pests, and use light to attract insects and use insects as feed to develop fish farming and frog farming. They also plan to experiment with using electricity for seed drying, seed vernalization, and rice warm bed seedling raising, and using electricity to increase water temperature to promote early rice maturity and avoid frost damage.

Two, it has created conditions for the development of local industry. The county plans to use the power supply from Daqiao to build a granular fertilizer plant with an annual output of 80,000 tons, which can solve the fertilizer problem for 64,000 hectares of dry land according to the current general fertilization level.

Three, it has improved the material and cultural living standards of the masses. Currently, 467 households and institutions and schools in the six natural villages of Daqiao and Xinglong Villages have installed 539 electric lights, and electric lights have been installed in public places such as threshing grounds and well edges. The agricultural cooperativization plan of Daqiao Village proposes: to establish two tap water stations in Daqiao and Zhixin natural villages in 1957 to supply water to institutions, schools, and residents. With electric lights, the literacy night schools and amateur theater troupes of the agricultural cooperatives have become more active, and more and more people go to the library to read books, newspapers, and pictorials after dinner.

Four, the establishment of the power station not only illuminated the rural houses, streets, and threshing grounds, but also illuminated the road for farmers to advance to socialism. After the power station was put into operation, the farmers were overjoyed and said everywhere: The words of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are really spoken and done, and they never dreamed that our village would build a power station. Zhang Qingsheng, a farmer in Xinglong Village, excitedly said: "For generations, I have never heard of any landlord who was 'rich' enough to have the strength to build a power station. Only by taking the road of cooperativization can we have today." More than a month after the construction of the station, one cooperative in Daqiao Village has been transformed into a higher-level cooperative, and the remaining five cooperatives have been merged into two large cooperatives.

In the process of building the station, we have the following experiences and lessons:

One, the Daqiao small hydropower station, from design and construction to completion, has always adhered to the principles of "relying on the masses, using local materials, manufacturing locally, adapting to local conditions, tapping potential, spending less money, and gaining quick benefits," overcoming difficulties in material conditions and saving expenses. For example, 50% of the electric poles and crossbeams used for the transmission line were raised by the masses themselves, and 514 cubic meters of rubble, gravel, and sand used for building the plant were collected by the masses from the local area. The generator and electrical equipment used for power generation were all bought used. The propeller-type water turbine was manufactured using locally produced oak wood.

According to the characteristics of rural electricity consumption being dispersed, with low load density and good conductivity, in the transmission project, the advanced experience of small rural power stations in the Soviet Union was adopted, and iron wires were used instead of copper wires, saving investment. The power transmission line adopted the "two-wire one-earth system" (that is, using two metal conductors, and using the earth instead of the other conductor), and the lighting transmission line used the "one-wire one-earth system", using one less conductor. The two items totaled a savings of 15,400 yuan, equivalent to 30% of the project cost.

Two, combined with the construction of the station, train cadres and prepare technical conditions for the future development of small hydropower stations. In the construction of the station, 5 administrative cadres and 3 water conservancy technicians were transferred from the agricultural science department, local state-owned farms, district offices, and irrigation management offices. The method of "taking the construction site as a school and the project as teaching material" was adopted, and "group internships to the end, unified centralized research, and segmented teaching" were implemented, so that all cadres and interns initially mastered the basic knowledge of construction, management, and various technical norms. In addition, 7 rural young electrical technicians were also trained, who generally learned the techniques of climbing poles, hanging wires, and installing lights indoors.

Three, all preparations must be made before construction. In the construction process of the Daqiao small hydropower station, because of insufficient material preparation and imperfect water pumping equipment, the water in the foundation pit could not be drained for 15 days, which affected the progress of the project. Before the construction of the station, due to the lack of hydrological data, and the occurrence of a drought last autumn and winter that had not been seen in more than 30 years, the water volume was insufficient, which also affected the utilization rate of the equipment.

Four, the strong cooperation of relevant departments is an important factor in the rapid completion of small hydropower stations. For example, in the process of manufacturing water turbines, workers from state-owned machinery factories and woodworking production cooperatives used creative labor to make up for the shortcomings of imperfect machinery and equipment and ensured the quality of processing. In the installation process, electrical technicians from the lumber mill and technicians and engineers from the Guoqian Banner Irrigation Management Office also organized volunteer support groups to help with the wiring work. The wiring workers stepped on more than a foot of snow and climbed poles to string wires under conditions of insufficient cold protection equipment. The Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and the Provincial Water Resources Bureau also sent technicians to assist in surveying, designing and guiding construction. Therefore, the task of piloting the hydropower station was successfully completed.

    大桥村小型水电站是怎样建成的
    吉林省敦化县县长　隋振
    过去在吉林省敦化县城东，靠近长（长春）图（图们）铁路大桥村附近的沙河上，有一座用柳条和石头砌成的拦河坝。每逢汛期，这座柳条坝总是被洪水拦腰冲断，使沿岸灌区用水失去保障，许多稻田都被撩荒了。1953年当地人民政府拨出了大批款项，在旧坝上游重建起一座钢骨水泥拦河重力坝，还加宽了原来的渠道，确保了沙河沿灌区用水，两年来新开和恢复水田500多垧。这座水坝的建立，也为建设水力发电站创造了条件。坝上、下游水位差3.5公尺，平均流量18.5秒公方，可以发电100瓩。
    1955年春季，拦河坝附近大桥、兴隆两村6个自然屯600多户农民，有80％参加了农业合作社。合作化以后，经济情况改善了，这两个村的农民要求进一步提高物质生活和文化生活水平，迫切地向往着建设水力电站。
    中共敦化县委员会和县人民委员会，根据群众的要求，在水利部和吉林省水利局的指导和协助下，在大桥村重点试办了一座农村小型水力发电站。
    这座小型水力发电站的全部工程计划分两期进行。第一期工程包括厂房一座，木制旋桨式水轮机一部（按100瓩设计），50瓩发电机一台及大桥、兴隆两村6个自然屯3，300伏输电线路工程。这一期工程已经在1955年11月28日完成，12月1日已经开始送电。第二期工程包括改装100瓩发电机一台、15，000伏高压输电线路25里以扩大供电范围。这期工程计划在今年下半年完成。第一期工程花费共50，036.98元，平均每瓩的建设费为1，000元，其中国家投资72％，群众自筹28％。根据成本核算，照明用电（因为没有电表设备，暂时按月按瓦收费），每瓦每月2分到2分5厘，如一盏30瓦的灯，每月收费7角5分，电费略高于大城市。动力用电每度3分4厘。
    这个小型水电站正式送电以后，给大桥、兴隆两村6个自然屯的农民群众带来了很多好处，给全县农村逐步实行电气化树立了榜样：
    一、推动了农业的技术改革。大桥、兴隆两村12个农业合作社已经合资购买7.5马力电动机一台，安装起全套碾米机和磨粉机各一部，每小时能磨面粉60斤或碾谷子300斤，可省出15头牲口用于农业生产；同时还安置了一台电动铡草机，计划还要安装5台，每台每小时可铡草600斤。这12个社还计划在今年春天开始设立电力抽水站一处，可把70垧旱地变为水田，今年春天先把40垧旱地变为水田，可增产粮食70吨。此外，还打算安装电动脱谷机、弹棉机、电气孵卵器，建立简易制材厂，试用电灯诱杀害虫，并且利用灯光诱虫，用虫做饲料发展养鱼、养蛤蟆等。用电力进行种子干燥，种子春化和水稻温床育苗，用电力提高水温促使水稻早熟，避免霜害等办法也要试验采用。
    二、给发展地方工业创造了条件。全县计划利用大桥的电源，建立年产量8万吨的颗粒肥料厂一座，按目前一般施肥水平，可解决64，000垧旱地的肥料问题。
    三、提高了群众物质和文化生活水平。目前大桥、兴隆两村6个自然屯已经有467户农户和机关、学校安装电灯539盏，公共场所如场院、井沿等都安了电灯。大桥村的农业合作化规划提出：1957年在大桥、智信两自然屯建立自来水站两处，供应机关、学校、居民用水。有了电灯，农业合作社的扫盲夜校和业余剧团更加活跃起来了，晚饭以后到图书室看书、报、画刊的人也越来越多了。
    四、电站的建立，不但照亮了农村的房舍、街道和场院，同时也照亮了农民向社会主义前进的道路。电站送电以后，农民欢欣鼓舞地到处讲：共产党和毛主席的话真是说到那办到那，做梦也没想到咱们屯修电站。兴隆屯农民张庆生兴奋地说：“祖祖辈辈也没听说哪家‘趁’钱的地主有力量修电站，只有走合作化道路才能有今天。”建站后的一个多月，大桥村已有一个社转为高级社，其余五个社已经合并为两个大社。
    在建站过程中我们有以下几点体会和经验：
    一、大桥小型水电站从设计、施工一直到建成，始终坚持了“依靠群众、就地取材、就地制造、因地制宜、挖掘潜力、花钱少、收益快”等原则，克服了物质条件上的困难，节省了开支。例如输电线路所用的电杆和横木有50％是群众自筹的，建筑厂房所用的块石、碎石、沙子共514公方，都是群众从当地采集的。发电用的发电机和电气器材都是买的旧的。旋桨式水轮机是利用当地出产的柞木制造的。
    根据农村用电分散、负荷密度小、导电率好等特点，在输电工程上，采用了苏联农村小型电站的先进经验，以铁导线代替铜导线，节省了投资；动力输电线采用了“二线一地制”（就是用两根金属导线，另外一根导线用大地代替），照明输电线用“一线一地制”，少用了一根导线。两项合计共节约15，400元，相当工程费的30％。
    二、结合建站，培养干部，为今后小型水电站的发展准备技术条件。在建站中抽调了农业科、地方国营农场、区公所、灌溉管理所等单位的行政干部5名，水利技术员3名，采取“以工地为学校，以工程为教材”，实行“分组实习到底、统一集中研究、分段教授”的办法，使全体干部和实习人员初步掌握了施工、管理的基本知识和各项技术定额。另外还培养了7名农村青年电气技工，他们一般学会了登杆挂线和室内装灯等技术。
    三、施工前必须做好一切准备。大桥小型水力发电站在施工过程中，因为物质准备不足，抽水设备不够完善，基坑的水15天抽不净，影响了工程进度。在建站前，由于水文资料缺乏，去年秋冬又发生30余年未有的干旱现象，水量不足，也影响到设备的利用率。
    四、有关部门的有力配合是小型水电站迅速建成的一个重要因素。例如在水轮机制造过程中，国营机械厂和木器生产合作社工人同志们以创造性的劳动，弥补了机械设备不完善的缺点，保证了加工质量。在安装过程中，制材厂的电气技工和郭前旗灌溉管理处的技工、技师们还组织了志愿增援小组，帮助进行架线工作。架线工人在防寒设备不足的条件下，踏着一尺多深的大雪，登杆架线。水利部设计院、省水利局也派技术人员协助勘查、设计并指导施工。因此顺利完成了试办水电站的任务。
