Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: The design team for the clothing exhibition to be held in Beijing has already designed and collected more than 190 sets of clothing styles. The "work skirt," a favorite of rural women in Jiangnan after some modifications, paired with a collarless shirt, will be a charming spring outfit for young girls. A short, double-breasted jacket, paired with a longer skirt, is suitable as casual wear for fuller-figured women. An open-necked, long cheongsam adorned with lace on the chest will be an elegant evening gown. There are also small floral vests for boys, sleeveless dresses for girls, and many other styles.

Some of these clothing styles will soon be sewn and exhibited at the clothing exhibition.

The design team is continuing to accelerate the design and collection of various clothing styles.

    新颖的服装式样设计出来了
    新华社24日讯　将在北京举行的服装展览会的设计组，已经设计和征集了190多套服装式样。经过加工的江南农村妇女爱穿的“作裙”，配上无领衬衫，将是少女们俏丽的春装。双襟小短袄，配上较长的裙子，适宜于给长得丰满的妇女作便服。敞领、前胸饰有花边的长旗袍，将是潇洒的晚礼服。还有男孩子们的小花背心，女孩子们无袖的衣连裙等，式样很多。
    这批服装式样中的一部分，很快将缝制起来在服装展览会上展出。
    设计组还在继续加速设计和征集各种服装式样。
