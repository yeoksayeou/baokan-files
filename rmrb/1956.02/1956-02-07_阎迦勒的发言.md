    Yan Jiale's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I wholeheartedly and completely endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the important reports of all the leading comrades.
    I feel very honored to live in this new era of our motherland's independent, prosperous, democratic, and thriving socialist society. I feel extremely excited about this.
    I am a Christian pastor and an extremely conservative person in the fundamentalist spiritual movement. I look at issues very subjectively, based on purely religious viewpoints, and I was deceived by the hypocritical and reactionary propaganda of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, as if a veil had blinded the wise eyes of my conscience. After liberation, all the splendid achievements, amazing construction, leaping progress, and countless examples of flourishing development, these grand and magnificent deeds, would never have been seen in the old society under the Kuomintang reactionary rule's dark and hopeless regime. The reason for today's achievements is due to the victory of the great and wise Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the 600 million Chinese people in their liberation struggle. Who knew that poor me, residing in the people's capital—Beijing, during the six years since the founding of New China, was blind and did not see these great and amazing achievements. What is even more lamentable is that under the control of such backward, deceived, poisoned, and reactionary thoughts, I committed many serious mistakes without realizing it. Fortunately, with the care of the motherland and the patient, kind, repeated, and sincere education of the government leaders, who repeatedly explained the government's religious policy, I was like someone who had been poisoned by gas and was brought into fresh air and woke up after medical care. Only then did I discover how deeply the poison of imperialism had penetrated my thinking. I sincerely repented and admitted my mistakes. An inexplicable force within me broke through my conservative thoughts, and the veil that had blinded the wise eyes of my conscience fell away. All the amazing construction, leaping progress, and countless examples of flourishing development in New China since liberation that I could not see before, I can now see clearly. It is truly like entering another world, everything is new.
    In October 1955, under the guidance of the Beijing Religious Affairs Bureau and the responsible leadership of the Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee, a city-wide study of anti-imperialist patriotism was launched among Christians. Once, a group of over 200 of us visited the Yellow River harnessing exhibition, and my heart was deeply moved! I couldn't stop the tears from falling! A thought, like a spring, kept湧出 from within me: Great! Great! Only the great and wise Communist Party and Chairman Mao can accomplish such a great undertaking. As the exhibition progressed, the guide turned and pointed us to the giant statue of Chairman Mao inspecting the Yellow River. Surprisingly, I saw Chairman Mao and felt he was so lovable! This was an experience I had never had before, despite seeing Chairman Mao's photos every day since liberation!
    I want to talk about two things I deeply experienced:
    Unity as One
    Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report also pointed out the great unity of the entire nation. I deeply experienced that the 600 million people are truly of one heart and mind, advancing towards a socialist society. This is indeed an invincible and tremendous force. But here I must point out that the biggest conspiracy of imperialism is to create division, to prevent us from uniting. I want to relate this to reality: Imperialism has been driven out of mainland China, but it is still unwilling to accept defeat and uses its agents, using faith as an excuse to provoke sectarian disputes, vainly attempting to undermine the anti-imperialist patriotic unity within Christianity. But its conspiracy has been exposed by us. After studying anti-imperialist patriotism, the Christians realized the importance of unity under the principle of "mutual respect" in faith. As a result, the unity within our Christianity has not only expanded and deepened, but also become more consolidated. Therefore, imperialism, which uses these conspiracies and tricks to undermine our unity, has once again suffered a severe blow from us.
    Religious Policy
    Vice Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries pointed out: There are still some counter-revolutionaries who wear the cloak of religion, using religious organizations as cover to carry out various counter-revolutionary activities. This indeed requires us religious believers to greatly improve our political sense of smell, especially to be vigilant against counter-revolutionaries wearing the cloak of religion. On the other hand, I also deeply experienced that Article 88 of the Constitution, which protects freedom of religious belief, is absolutely true. The government arrests those who engage in counter-revolutionary activities under the cloak of religion, not because they have religious beliefs. The right to freedom of religious belief is given to patriotic and law-abiding religious believers, and Article 88 of the Constitution must never be used to provide convenience for counter-revolutionaries wearing the cloak of religion. I feel it is my responsibility to clearly explain this to religious believers, not only to give them a correct understanding, but also to reassure them that the government's protection of freedom of religious belief is completely true and reliable, so there should be no doubt about the religious policy to avoid giving imperialism an opportunity to exploit. Because imperialism has always doubted whether there is freedom of religious belief in the New China led by the Communist Party. At the same time, it also spread rumors that in the people's capital—Beijing, the Communist Party also executed 29 Christian pastors. This rumor was fabricated in Geneva in front of our Premier Zhou. This is a complete lie. We must expose its lies, recognize its tricks, and even more so not give it a chance to exploit. We patriotic and law-abiding religious believers must use the living facts of the people's government protecting freedom of religious belief, which we have deeply experienced, to answer the rumor-mongering and lying imperialism, so that the rumor-mongers will be ashamed and disgraced.
    Finally, today, as the 600 million Chinese people march forward towards the road of building a prosperous socialist society, in order to ensure the smooth progress of our country's socialist construction, we must smash the destructive activities of enemies at home and abroad against our socialist construction cause. I want to rise up and accelerate the pace of strengthening unity in the nationwide Christian anti-imperialist patriotic movement under the banner of socialism, and advance along the bright road of anti-imperialist patriotic education.

    阎迦勒的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我衷心完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和各位首长的各项重要报告。
    我感觉非常荣幸的：生活在今天我们祖国独立富强民主繁荣的社会主义社会的新时代当中，为了这个我觉得极其兴奋。
    我是一个基督教的教牧人员，并且是基要属灵派中思想极其保守的人，看问题都是很主观的，根据纯宗教思想的观点，再加上过去受了帝国主义和国民党反动派虚伪反动宣传的欺骗，如同帕子蒙蔽了我良心的慧眼。在解放后一切辉煌的成就，惊人的建设，飞跃的进步，百花齐放数不胜数。这些个轰轰烈烈伟大的事迹，是在国民党反动统治暗无天日政权下的旧社会里永不会看见。其所以有今天的成就，乃是因伟大英明的共产党和毛主席领导着六亿中国人民解放斗争胜利所带来的。谁知可怜的我，居住在人民的首都——北京，在新中国成立了六载的时光中，瞎眼的却没有看见这些伟大的、惊人的成就，更可叹的是在这样的一个落后、受骗、中毒、反动的思想支配之下，犯了多少严重的错误而不自觉。幸有祖国的关怀，得蒙政府首长耐心的、和蔼的、多次的、诚恳的教育，再三的讲明了政府的宗教政策，所以我才像中了煤气被带到新鲜空气中经过医疗看护后苏醒过来的人一样，这时才发现了在我的思想里中了帝国主义的毒素是何其深。我就真诚悔改承认错误，莫名其妙的我里头有个力量突破了我保守的思想，蒙蔽着良心慧眼的帕子也就掉下去了。先前所看不见新中国从解放以来惊人的建设，飞跃的进步，百花齐放数不胜数的那些个史无前例辉煌的成就，今天样样都看得清楚了。真如进到另一个世界，一切都是新的了。
    1955年10月间，北京市在宗教事务处的指导和基督教三自爱国运动学委会的负责带领下，展开全市基督教徒反帝爱国自觉的学习。一次我们集体有200余人参观根治黄河的展览，我的心大大地受了感动！我止不住的掉下了眼泪来！我里面有个思想像泉水似的一直涌出，伟大！伟大！只有伟大英明的共产党和毛主席才能做出这样伟大的事业来。展览往前去的过程中，讲解员转身指给我们看毛主席视察黄河的巨像，顶希奇的我看见了毛主席不知怎么觉得那么样可爱！这是解放以来无日不见毛主席的照片而从未有过这样情感的一次经历！
    深切体验到的两件事，我要讲在下面：
    团结如一
    周恩来主席的政治报告里也指出全民族的大团结，我深切的体验到了六亿人民诚然是一条心的向着社会主义社会前进。这的确是一支无敌的、巨大的力量。可是我在这里不能不指出帝国主义最大的阴谋就是制造分裂，叫我们彼此不能团结。我要结合实际来说：帝国主义已被赶出中国大陆，它却死不甘心的借着它的代理人，以信仰作为借口挑起宗派的争端，妄想在基督教内部破坏反帝爱国的团结。但是它的阴谋已被我们戳穿了。教徒们经过了反帝爱国的学习，认识到了在信仰“互相尊重”原则下的团结，因而使得我们基督教内部的团结不止扩大、深入，而且也更加巩固起来了。因而用这阴谋诡计破坏我们团结的帝国主义，又一次受到了我们厉害的打击。
    宗教政策
    董必武副主席关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告里指出：还有些反革命分子披着宗教的外衣，以宗教团体为掩护，进行各种反革命活动。这的确叫我们宗教徒政治的嗅觉要大大地提高，尤其是要警惕披着宗教外衣的反革命分子。在另一方面，我也深切的体验到了宪法88条所载，保护宗教信仰自由的宗教政策是千真万确，政府所逮捕的是披着宗教外衣进行反革命活动的人，并不是因着他有宗教信仰而逮捕归案的。宗教信仰自由的权利是给爱国守法教徒的，而绝不能因宪法88条所载，给披着宗教外衣的反革命分子大开方便之门。我觉得我有责任对宗教徒清楚地说明这一点，不止叫他们有正确的认识，更是让他们放心相信政府保护宗教信仰自由是完全真确可靠的，所以绝不该有丝毫对宗教政策的怀疑以免给帝国主义钻空子的机会。因为帝国主义一直的是在怀疑共产党领导的新中国到底有无宗教信仰自由，同时它也造谣说过在人民的首都——北京，共产党还枪决了基督教牧师29名。这谣言是在日内瓦造在我们周总理面前的。这真是弥天大谎。我们要揭露它的谎言，认识它的诡计，更是不给它钻空子的机会。我们爱国守法的宗教徒，要用我们深切体验到的人民的政府保护宗教信仰自由的活生生的事实，来回答造谣撒谎的帝国主义，使造谣者蒙羞抱愧。
    最后，在六亿中国人民向着建设社会主义繁荣社会的道路上全体大进军的今天，我们为了保障我国社会主义建设的顺利进行，必须粉碎内外敌人对我国社会主义建设事业的破坏活动。我要起来加快速度的在社会主义的旗帜下，全国基督教反帝爱国运动加强团结，沿着反帝爱国教育的这条光明大道前进。
