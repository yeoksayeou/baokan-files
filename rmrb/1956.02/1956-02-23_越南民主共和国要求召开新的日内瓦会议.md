Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 23rd. The Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam announced a letter from Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on the issue of Indochina on February 14th. In this letter, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requested the convening of a new Geneva Conference on the issue of Indochina to discuss measures to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The full text of the letter is as follows:
    Dear Chairmen:
    In your letter to me of December 21, 1955, after analyzing the fact that some provisions of the Geneva Accords were not fully implemented, you requested the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference on the issue of Indochina, as well as the member states of the International Supervisory and Control Commission, to propose recommendations that could guarantee the implementation of this agreement.
    In this letter, I have the honor to state to you the position taken by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the necessary measures that should be implemented in order to fulfill the Geneva Accords.
    It must be reiterated that the Geneva Conference on Indochina, convened in 1954, restored peace in Indochina on the basis of recognizing the national interests of the people of the countries of Indochina. This conference led to the signing of the agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and adopted a final declaration stipulating the principles for resolving various political issues in Indochina on the basis of respecting the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the countries of Indochina. The Geneva Conference not only laid the foundation for a stable and lasting peace in Indochina, but also contributed to easing international tensions in Asia and around the world.
    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently, in this spirit, thoroughly and correctly implemented the Geneva Accords: assembling and transferring troops north of the 17th parallel, not importing new weapons, ammunition, and new foreign military personnel, not establishing foreign military bases, and not joining foreign military alliances. It has not retaliated against those who cooperated with the other side, has guaranteed various democratic rights and freedoms, and has worked closely with the International Supervisory and Control Commission. In addition, in order to resolve political issues, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly put forward specific and practical proposals for convening consultative conferences between representatives of the two regions in order to discuss the issue of free general elections to be held in July 1956, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.
    The constructive and consistent attitude of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been warmly received by all the people of Vietnam and supported by peace-loving people around the world.
    However, the attitude adopted by the South Vietnamese regime is completely the opposite. They have openly declared their opposition to the Geneva Accords and refused to implement many extremely important clauses of the Geneva Accords.
    Indeed, the military clauses of the agreement have been violated: new weapons, ammunition, and new foreign military personnel have been imported into South Vietnam, foreign military bases have been established, military alliances have been formed in practice with foreign countries, and conspiracies to join a military bloc have taken place.
    The clauses concerning democratic rights and freedoms have also been violated: systematic retaliation has been carried out against personnel who participated in the war of resistance in the past, all individual freedoms, freedom of speech and publication have been abolished, and concentration camps have been established.
    Secondly, with regard to the resolution of political issues, the South Vietnamese regime has stubbornly rejected the proposals put forward by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which aimed at restoring normal relations between the North and the South, and aimed at convening consultative conferences to discuss the issue of holding free general elections in July 1956, as stipulated in the Geneva Accords. Especially after organizing the so-called "referendum" on October 23, 1955, the South Vietnamese regime is now preparing to conduct unilateral elections, the obvious purpose of which is to create a separate state in South Vietnam, which is in complete violation of the letter and spirit of the Geneva Agreement. It stipulates that the military demarcation line is only temporary and cannot be interpreted as a political or territorial boundary, and that the political system of Vietnam will be established after free general elections throughout the country.
    It should also be added that, to this day, the International Supervisory and Control Commission has made practical contributions to the implementation of the Geneva Accords, but on July 20, 1955, its office address in Saigon was violated, and the South Vietnamese regime prevented it from moving its main office to Saigon, intentionally obstructing the activities of the International Commission.
    In order to justify its attitude of opposing the Geneva Accords, the South Vietnamese regime has used the excuse that it did not sign the Geneva Accords, so it has no obligation to fulfill this agreement. It is clear that this reason has no basis whatsoever, because the Government of the French Republic negotiated and concluded the Geneva Accords in the name of the French government, while also representing the South Vietnamese authorities. The South Vietnamese regime, in requesting and obtaining the transfer of administrative power over South Vietnam, has already implicitly agreed to the Geneva Accords.
    It is obvious that the South Vietnamese regime is attempting to turn South Vietnam into a separate country with a dictatorial system, to turn South Vietnam into a foreign military base, and to drag South Vietnam into a military alliance in order to prepare to re-ignite the war in Indochina. The blatant and provocative statements of the military commanders of the South Vietnamese regime, inciting its troops to prepare to "march north," have clearly demonstrated this.
    Under these circumstances, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that our country is facing a serious threat: the implementation of the Geneva Accords is being undermined, the legitimate aspirations and national interests of the Vietnamese people recognized by the Geneva Accords are not being respected, and peace in Indochina is being threatened.
    The South Vietnamese regime must share the responsibility for this situation with the French government, which was one of the parties that signed the Geneva Accords.
    In this serious situation, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which has always been faithful to its policy of guiding the signing of the Geneva Accords, namely to resolve all disputes through peaceful consultation, requests the convening of a new Geneva Conference on the issue of Indochina, with the participation of the three countries of the International Supervisory and Control Commission, which understand the situation in Vietnam and will be able to make useful contributions to the conference.
    The new Geneva Conference on the issue of Indochina will have the task of studying and jointly reaching agreements to decide on measures to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords, especially the resolution of political issues: the reunification of the Vietnamese state through free general elections throughout the country.
    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the participating countries of the Geneva Conference on the issue of Indochina have a responsibility to ensure that the Geneva Accords are fully implemented in order to establish a stable and lasting peace in Vietnam.
    Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to convene a new Geneva Conference on the issue of Indochina with the participation of the countries of the International Commission.
    In requesting the convening of such a conference, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will continue to strive to bring the Northern and Southern regions of Vietnam closer together.
    Please accept, dear Chairmen, my highest respects.
    Pham Van Dong
    Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Hanoi, February 14, 1956

### 越南民主共和国要求召开新的日内瓦会议

    越南民主共和国要求召开新的日内瓦会议
    新华社河内23日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部新闻司公布了越南民主共和国政府总理兼外交部长范文同2月14日给关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席的信件。在这封信里，越南民主共和国政府要求召开关于印度支那问题的新的日内瓦会议，以讨论保证日内瓦协定的履行的措施。这封信的全文如下：各位主席：
    在寄给我的1955年12月21日的函件中，两位就日内瓦协定若干条款得不到充分的履行作了分析之后，曾经要求有关印度支那问题的1954年日内瓦会议的参加国以及国际监督和监察委员会成员国提出能够保证这个协定的履行的建议。
    在本函件中，我荣幸地向两位申述越南民主共和国政府对为了履行日内瓦协定而应该予以实现的必要办法所采取的立场。
    必须再次提到，在1954年所召开的有关印度支那问题的日内瓦会议曾经在承认印度支那各国人民的民族利益的基础上恢复印度支那的和平。这个会议导致了越南、柬埔寨和老挝的停止敌对行动协定的签订，并且通过了最后宣言，规定了在尊重印度支那各国的主权、独立、统一和领土完整的基础上解决印度支那各项政治问题的原则。日内瓦会议不仅为印度支那的稳固和持久的和平奠定了基础，而且还对缓和亚洲和全世界的国际紧张局势作出了贡献。
    越南民主共和国政府方面已经不断地本着这个精神彻底地和正确地来履行日内瓦协定：集结和转移军队到17度纬线以北，不运入新的武器弹药和新的外国军事人员，不建立外国军事基地，不加入外国的军事联盟。对曾经和对方合作的人不加以报复，保障各项自由民主权利，同国际监督和监察委员会紧密合作。此外，为了解决政治问题，越南民主共和国政府曾经一再提出关于召开两个地区间的代表的协商会议的具体和切实可行的建议，以便正确地按照日内瓦协定的规定，讨论在1956年7月举行的自由普选问题。
    越南民主共和国政府的建设性的和始终不变的态度已经受到了全体越南人民的热烈响应，并且受到了世界爱好和平人民的支持。
    但是，越南南方政权所采取的态度则截然相反。他们曾经公然宣布反对日内瓦协定，并且不肯履行日内瓦协定的许多极其重要的条款。
    的确，协定的军事条款曾经遭到了违反：新的武器弹药和新的外国军事人员被运入南越，建立外国军事基地，在实际上和外国结成军事联盟，阴谋加入一个军事集团。
    关于自由民主权利的条款也遭到违反：对过去曾经参加抗战的人员进行有系统的报复，取消一切个人自由、言论和出版自由权利，建立集中营。
    其次，对于政治问题的解决，越南南方政权一意拒绝越南民主共和国政府所提出的目的在于恢复北方和南方的正常关系、目的在于召开协商会议以讨论按照日内瓦协定所规定的在1956年7月份进行自由普选问题的建议。尤其是在1955年10月23日组织所谓“公民投票”以后，越南南方政权又正在准备进行片面选举，其明显的目的是在越南南方制造一个单独的国家，这完全违反了日内瓦协议的条文和精神。它规定：军事分界线只是临时性的，完全不能被解释为政治的或领土的界线，而越南的政治制度将在全国自由普选后建立。
    也应该补充说明，时至今日，国际监督和监察委员会已为日内瓦协议的履行作出切实的贡献，然而在1955年7月20日，它在西贡的办公地址竟遭到侵犯，而且越南南方政权不让它把主要办公处迁移到西贡去，有意地阻碍国际委员会的活动。
    为了给它的反对日内瓦协定的态度辩护，越南南方政权借口他们没有签订日内瓦协定，所以它没有履行这个协定的义务。很明显，这个理由完全没有任何有价值的基础，因为法兰西共和国政府是以法国政府的名义、同时代表越南南方当局来谈判和缔结日内瓦协定的。越南南方政权在他们要求和得到接管越南南方行政管理权的时候，已经默认日内瓦协定。
    明显的是，越南南方政权企图把南越变成一个独裁制度的单独国家，把南越变成一个外国军事基地，把南越拖入一个军事联盟以准备重新挑起印度支那的战争。越南南方政权的军事指挥官的露骨和挑衅的声明，煽动它的军队准备“北进”，都已明显的证明了这一点。
    在这种情况下，越南民主共和国政府认为我们的国家正在受到严重的威胁：日内瓦协定的履行正在被破坏，日内瓦协定所承认的越南人民的正当愿望和民族利益没有得到尊重，印度支那的和平正在受到威胁。
    越南南方政权必须和签订日内瓦协定的一方的法国政府共同对这种情况负责。
    在这种严重情况下，一贯忠诚于自己指导日内瓦协定的签订的政策，即以和平协商来解决一切争端的政策的越南民主共和国政府要求召开关于印度支那问题的新的日内瓦会议，有国际监督和监察委员会的3个国家参加，这些国家了解越南情况，将能给会议作出有益的贡献。
    关于印度支那问题的新的日内瓦会议，将有这样的任务：研究和共同达成协议，以决定保证日内瓦协定的履行的措施，尤其是政治问题的解决：通过全国自由普选实现越南国家的统一。
    越南民主共和国政府认为关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的参加国有责任保证日内瓦协定得到充分履行以在越南建立稳固和持久的和平。
    因此，召开有国际委员会的各国参加的关于印度支那问题的新的日内瓦会议是必要而迫切的。
    在要求召开这样的会议的时候，越南民主共和国政府将为使越南北方、南方两地区互相接近不断努力。
    请各位主席接受我对您们的崇高的敬意。
    越南民主共和国总理兼外交部长范文同
          1956年2月14日在河内
