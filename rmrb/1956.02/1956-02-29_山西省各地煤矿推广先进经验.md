Shanxi Province coal mines in various regions are actively promoting advanced experiences and have already achieved preliminary results.

The workers of the Datong Mining Bureau's tunneling teams, in carrying out the socialist emulation drive to advance 10,000 meters per year, learned from each other's strengths to offset their weaknesses, and actively promoted the various advanced experiences of Zhang Wanfu's tunneling team. Zhang Wanfu's team also learned the drilling methods of Zhang Fugui's team. Since late January, the vast majority of tunneling teams at this mining bureau have been able to advance more than 20 meters per day, with 7 teams advancing 30 to 38 meters per day, an increase of one to two times the average daily tunneling progress of last year. The No. 53 coal mining team of the Second Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau promoted a one-shift coal mining system, with a daily output of up to 380 tons.

The promotion of advanced experience has enabled more and more coal mines to have the conditions to complete the tasks stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. For example, the Xiangyuan Coal Mine recently proposed to increase labor productivity by 25% over the 1957 target by the end of April this year.

    山西省各地煤矿推广先进经验
    山西省各地煤矿积极推广先进经验，已经取得初步成绩。
    大同矿务局掘进队的工人们，在开展年进一万公尺的社会主义竞赛中，互相取长补短，积极地推行张万福掘进队的各项先进经验，张万福队也学习张富贵队的打眼方法。从1月下旬以来，这个矿务局绝大多数掘进队作到了日进20公尺以上，其中有7个队日进30到38公尺，比去年平均每日掘进进度提高一倍到两倍左右。阳泉矿务局二矿五三采煤队推广一班采煤制，日产量高达380吨。
    推广先进经验，使越来越多的煤矿具备了提早完成第一个五年计划规定任务的条件。如襄垣煤矿最近就提出要在今年4月底使劳动生产率超过1957年指标的25％。
