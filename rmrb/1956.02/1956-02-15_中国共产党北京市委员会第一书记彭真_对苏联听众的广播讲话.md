Comrades and friends of Moscow and all the Soviet Union:

    Six years ago today, the government of the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the government of the People's Republic of China signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This treaty has cemented the friendship and unity of 800 million people in our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, promoted the prosperity of the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union, and safeguarded and promoted peace in the Far East and the world, and the cause of progress for all mankind. Now, with infinite joy, I represent all the people of Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, to extend warm congratulations and deep gratitude to the heroic people of Moscow and the people of the Soviet Union.

    On this day of great historical significance, the 20th Congress of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union has opened. This congress will discuss and adopt the instructions on the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union on the basis of the Soviet people's victorious completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, in order to promote the further upsurge of the Soviet people's communist cause. This is a great encouragement to the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. We warmly congratulate the great Soviet people on their continuous new achievements in the cause of building communism, and we warmly congratulate the opening of the 20th Congress of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    The brilliance of the great Soviet socialist construction achievements shines on our road forward in China, and great Moscow has set a good example for Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China. Every achievement made by the heroic people of Moscow and the people of the entire Soviet Union has become a force to encourage us to move forward. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people for their great and selfless assistance in all aspects. We, the working people of Beijing and all of China, are deeply happy and proud to have such good teachers and friends of communism who share weal and woe with Moscow and the people of the entire Soviet Union.

    We Chinese people are carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation. I would like to tell you some recent developments in Beijing. Our Beijing people are not only completing our First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, but are also accelerating the completion of socialist transformation. Agriculture in the suburbs of Beijing has realized complete socialist cooperativization. Capitalist industry and commerce in the city have implemented joint state-private ownership, and have all become advanced forms of state capitalist enterprises under the leadership of the socialist economy. The handicraft industry has also fully realized cooperativization. All parts of our country, like Beijing, are advancing on the road of socialism at roughly the same speed and on a huge scale. I think when you know we have such achievements, you must be as happy and inspired as we are, because our achievements are also your achievements.

    Let us shout:
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live our good teacher and friend, the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great Communist Party of China!
    Long live great Marxism-Leninism!
    Long live great Moscow and Beijing!

    中国共产党北京市委员会第一书记彭真
    对苏联听众的广播讲话
    亲爱的莫斯科和全苏联的同志们，朋友们：
    在六年前的今天，伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府和中华人民共和国政府，签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约。这个条约固定了我们中苏两国8万万人的友谊和团结，促进了中苏两大国的繁荣，维护和促进了远东和世界的和平和全人类的进步事业。现在，我以无限愉快的心情，代表中华人民共和国首都——北京市的全体人民，向英雄的莫斯科人民和苏联人民，致热烈的祝贺和深切的感谢。
    在这个具有重大历史意义的日子里，伟大的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会开幕了。这次大会将在苏联人民胜利地完成了发展国民经济第五个五年计划的基础上，讨论和通过关于发展苏联国民经济第六个五年计划的指示，以推动苏联人民的共产主义事业的进一步高涨。这对于中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，都是极大的鼓舞。我们热烈地祝贺伟大的苏联人民在建设共产主义的事业中，不断地取得新的成就，我们热烈地祝贺伟大的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的开幕。
    伟大的苏联社会主义建设的成就的光辉，照耀着我们中国前进的道路，伟大的莫斯科给我们中华人民共和国首都——北京市树立了良好的榜样。英雄的莫斯科的人民和全苏联的人民所取得的每一个成就，都成为鼓舞我们前进的力量。我们对于苏联人民在各方面所给予我们的巨大的和无私的援助，表示衷心的感谢。我们北京市和全中国的劳动人民，因为有莫斯科和全苏联人民这样的共产主义的同甘苦、共患难的良师益友，而深深感到高兴和骄傲。
    我们中国人民正在进行着社会主义建设和社会主义改造。我现在告诉你们一些北京市最近的情况。我们北京市人民不但正在提早和超额完成着我们第一个五年计划，并且正在加快地完成着社会主义改造。北京市郊区农业，已经实现了完全社会主义的合作化。全市的资本主义工商业，已经实行了公私合营，全部成为社会主义经济领导下的高级形式的国家资本主义企业。手工业也已经全部实现了合作化。我们全国各地也和北京一样，正在以大体相同的速度和巨大的规模在社会主义的道路上前进着。我想当你们知道我们有这样成就的时候，你们一定也和我们一样欢欣鼓舞，因为我们的成就同时也就是你们的成就。
    让我们高呼：
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    我们的良师益友伟大的苏联共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的马克思、列宁主义万岁！
    伟大的莫斯科、北京万岁！
