    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    During this meeting, I listened to the reports made by Chairman Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, and Dong Biwu, and Committee Member Chen Boda. I received a tremendous education and encouragement, and I wholeheartedly support them. Currently, our socialist transformation and socialist construction are developing at an even larger scale and faster pace. In order to safeguard our great cause, we need to strive for a lasting international environment of peace. However, American imperialism is not only engaging in various policies of war blackmail, but also occupying our territory of Taiwan, directly creating tension in the Taiwan region. As someone from Fujian, I understand that the people of Fujian are very concerned about the issue of liberating Taiwan. Now, I would like to express some personal thoughts on this issue.
    Taiwan is our sacred territory. The main reason why Taiwan has not been liberated to this day is that the United States uses force to occupy Taiwan, interferes in China's internal affairs, and turns Taiwan into its military base. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this act of aggression by American imperialism. No matter how American imperialism clamors and intimidates, it cannot stop our liberation of Taiwan.
    Let's take past facts as an example! On July 16, 1953, the remnants of the bandits entrenched in Jinmen (Quemoy) and Taiwan, under the command of American imperialism, put together more than 10,000 people and, under the cover of airplanes and warships, carried out a harassing attack on Dongshan, Fujian. However, the result was that in less than two days, we annihilated more than 3,300 people. The remaining bandits fled in panic and had to escape into the sea. This shows that if American imperialism dares to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan, the final result will certainly be a complete failure.
    Our Fujian faces Jinmen and Taiwan, being the front line of the war to liberate Taiwan. In the past few years, with the active support of the people of the whole country, the people of Fujian have waged an unyielding struggle against American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique it has fostered. Especially after the joint declaration of the democratic parties to liberate Taiwan was issued in August 1954, all the people of the province, men, women, old and young, struggled day and night for the liberation of Taiwan. For example, when the People's Liberation Army shelled Jinmen on September 3rd of the previous year, and when the people of Fuzhou launched an anti-bombing struggle on January 20th of last year, many touching and heroic deeds emerged, demonstrating a high degree of revolutionary heroism. They deeply felt the importance of their responsibilities, and therefore, they all fought with active and concrete actions for the early liberation of Taiwan.
    Now, the people of the whole country are celebrating the overall victory of socialist transformation and are also urgently demanding the liberation of Taiwan. We miss our 8 million compatriots in Taiwan who are suffering under the military rule of American imperialism. The people of Taiwan, seeing the growing strength of the motherland, must also be looking forward to returning to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Even those Kuomintang military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan from the mainland, many of them are facing the fragmented and miserable situation within the Kuomintang, are hesitating, at a loss, and uneasy. Therefore, among them, there must be many who hope to realize the liberation of the entire Taiwan through peaceful means. The people of Taiwan are an inseparable part of the Chinese people, and this desire is in line with the interests of the entire country and the people. As Chairman Zhou Enlai said, "All of us Chinese people, including the people on the mainland and the people in Taiwan, should unite under the banner of patriotism and work together to solve this matter that belongs to our internal affairs."
    I think that this great call from the Central Committee and Chairman Mao will not fail to move the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan who have a patriotic conscience. However, we cannot assume that there will not be some desperate people who attempt to resist stubbornly and make a last-ditch struggle. Therefore, on the one hand, we do not rule out the possibility of liberating Taiwan through peaceful means, but on the other hand, we must step up preparations so that we can use war to liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan when necessary.
    The international issue of the tense situation in the Taiwan region caused by American imperialism's occupation of Taiwan and interference in China's internal affairs must not be confused with the domestic issue between the Chinese government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We want to tell the American imperialists that the Chinese people who have stood up under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao cannot be bullied or intimidated. We will never allow any third party to interfere in our internal affairs. We also want to tell the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that we must liberate Taiwan, and Taiwan will eventually return to the motherland. There are only two paths before you: one is to be stubbornly wrong, completely oppose the people of the motherland, and insist on being a running dog of American imperialism, then you will eventually be abandoned and destroyed by the people of the motherland; the other is to help the motherland eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan region and realize the complete reunification of the great motherland through peaceful means. If you are willing to take the latter path, the people of the motherland will treat you with leniency.
    Please correct me if the above speech is inappropriate.

    刘通的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在这次会议上，我听了周恩来主席、郭沫若、陈叔通、董必武三位副主席和陈伯达委员所作的各项报告，我受到一次极大的教育和鼓舞，我衷心表示拥护。目前我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业正在以更大的规模和更快的速度向前发展，为着保障我们的伟大事业，就需要争取一个持久的国际和平环境。但是，美帝国主义不仅在进行着各种的战争讹诈政策，而且侵占着我国的领土台湾，直接造成了台湾地区的紧张局势。我从福建来，了解到福建人民非常关心解放台湾的问题，现在我仅就这个问题发表一点个人的感想。
    台湾是我国的神圣领土。台湾所以直到今天还没有获得解放，主要的原因是美国使用武力霸占台湾，干涉中国内政，把台湾变成了它的军事基地。中国人民对于美帝国主义这种侵略行为，是完全不能容忍的，不管美国帝国主义如何叫嚣和恐吓，都阻挡不了我们台湾的解放。
    拿过去的事实来说吧！1953年7月16日，盘踞在金门台湾的残匪在美国帝国主义指挥之下，拼凑1万余人，并在飞机和兵舰的掩护之下，向我福建东山进行窜扰，但是结果不到两天的时间，便被我歼灭了3，300余人，其余的残匪狼奔豕突，不得不落海而逃。这说明美国帝国主义如果敢于阻挠我们解放台湾，其最后结果，一定是以彻底失败而告终。
    我们福建面对金门、台湾，为解放台湾战争的最前线，在过去几年中，福建人民在全国人民的积极支援下，曾经和美国帝国主义及其所豢养的蒋介石卖国集团进行过不屈不挠的斗争，特别是1954年8月各民主党派解放台湾联合宣言发表以后，全省人民无论男女老幼，都日日夜夜的为解放台湾而斗争。例如：前年9月3日解放军炮击金门，去年1月20日福州市人民展开反轰炸斗争，都曾经涌现了不少可歌可泣的英勇事迹，表现了高度的革命英雄主义精神，他们深切地感到自己责任的重大，因此，他们都以积极的具体行动为早日解放台湾而奋斗。
    现在，全国人民正在欢庆社会主义改造的全面胜利，同时也迫切的要求解放台湾，我们怀念着沦在美国帝国主义武力统治下的台湾800万同胞。台湾人民眼看着祖国的日益强大，也一定期待着早日回到祖国的怀抱，就是那些从大陆跑到台湾去的国民党军政人员，也有不少的人面对着国民党内部支离破碎的惨境，正在徘徊失措，惶恐不安。因此，在他们之中，一定有不少的人是希望通过和平途径来实现整个台湾的解放。台湾人民是中国人民不可分离的一部分，这种愿望是符合整个国家和人民的利益的，正如周恩来主席所说的，“我们全体中国人民，包括大陆人民和台湾人民，应该在爱国主义旗帜下团结起来，共同努力来自己解决这个属于我国内部的事务。”
    中央和毛主席这种伟大的号召，我想凡是有爱国天良的台湾国民党军政人员是不会不动于衷的，但是，我们不能设想，其中就不会没有一些丧心病狂的人冀图负隅顽抗，作垂死的挣扎。因此，我们一方面不排除用和平方式解放台湾的可能性，但另方面也要加紧准备，以便必要时用战争方式来解放我们的神圣领土——台湾。
    美国帝国主义侵占台湾和干涉中国内政所造成的台湾地区紧张局势的国际问题，绝不容许同中国政府和蒋介石卖国集团之间的中国国内问题混为一谈。我们要告诉美帝国主义者，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下已经站起来了的中国人民是不能被欺侮的，也不会被吓倒的，我们绝不允许任何第三者来干涉我国的内政。我们也要告诉蒋介石卖国集团，我们一定要解放台湾，台湾最后也必然归还祖国，摆在你们面前的只有两条路，一条是执迷不悟，彻底与祖国人民为敌，坚持作美帝国主义走狗，那最终必被祖国人民所唾弃，所毁灭；另一条就是通过和平途径，帮助祖国消除台湾地区的紧张局势，实现伟大祖国的完全统一，如果你们愿意走后一条路，祖国人民都将要对你们宽大对待。
    以上发言，是否妥当，请指正。
