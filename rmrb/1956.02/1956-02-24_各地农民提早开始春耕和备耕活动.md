Spring plowing season has arrived. Farmers in various regions, with fervent enthusiasm for production, are starting spring plowing, sowing, and preparatory work early.

Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, where the season starts earlier, have already begun spring plowing and sowing. The spring plowing work in Guangxi Province started more than half a month earlier than last year. In Du'an Yao Autonomous County and more than 10 other counties in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, over 30,000 mu of early corn have already been sown.

Farmers in various regions are carrying out preparatory work intensely. Shanxi Province has prepared all kinds of high-quality seeds needed for this year's spring sowing. In the Changzhi, Xinzhou, and Jinan three special districts alone, more than 5,000 agricultural production cooperatives have selected more than 15.28 million jin of high-quality seeds of corn, millet, sorghum, cotton, and other crops. In Hubei Province, a major cotton-producing area, the state-established seed fumigation stations are busy fumigating cotton seeds harboring cotton bollworm pests to kill the bollworms.

Digging wells and repairing canals to tap water conservancy potential has also become a popular trend in various regions. The water conservancy potential in the 800-li Qin Chuan area of Shaanxi Province is very large. The agricultural production cooperatives in this area plan to dig 100,000 new wells of various types this year, and the agricultural production cooperatives in Lintong and 12 other counties that started earlier have already dug more than 30,000 wells. More than 500,000 farmland water conservancy projects have been completed in Hunan Province, exceeding the original plan by 10%.

A mass movement to find fertilizer sources and accumulate manure is also unfolding in rural areas across the country. In Zhezha Township, Liuchu District, Shuicheng County, Bijie Special District, Guizhou Province, the masses found a large forest that no one had visited for more than 100 years. The soil, rotten leaves, and bird droppings piled up inside were more than a foot thick, and millions of loads of fertilizer could be dug out. The fertilizer sources found in Sanchu and Wuchu districts of Yutian County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, are enough to last the 110,000 mu of cultivated land in these two districts for three years.

Some areas have also launched work to support spring plowing. Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province is also transporting its excellent "Hequ Horse" breed to the interior to provide draught power for using new farm implements. The Shuangyang County Handicraft Production Cooperative in Jilin Province has actively established a new farm implement repair and distribution network to ensure the completion of the repair and distribution tasks of new farm implements in the county before spring plowing.

In the preparatory work, some local Party committees have gone deep into the countryside to actively lead.

    各地农民提早开始春耕和备耕活动
    春耕季节到来了。各地农民正以沸腾的生产热情，提早开始春耕播种和备耕工作。
    季节较早的广东、广西等省已经开始春耕播种。广西省春耕工作开始的时间比去年提早半个多月。桂西僮族自治区都安瑶族自治县和大新等10多个县，现在已经播种了早玉米3万多亩。
    各地农民的备耕工作正在紧张进行。山西省各地已经备妥今年春播所需用的各种优良籽种。仅长治、忻县、晋南3个专区的5，000多个农业生产合作社挑选了1，528万多斤玉米、谷子、高粱、棉花等良种。湖北省主要棉产区，国家设立的种籽熏染站，正忙着熏染潜藏有红铃虫害的棉花种籽，以杀灭红铃虫。
    打井修渠，挖掘水利潜力，在各地也形成了热潮。陕西省八百里秦川地区的水利潜力很大。这个地区的农业生产合作社，计划今年新打各种水井10万眼，动工较早的临潼等13个县的农业生产合作社已经打井3万多眼。湖南全省农田水利工程已经修好50多万处，超过原计划10％。
    群众性的找肥源、积肥运动也在各地农村展开。贵州省毕节专区的水城县六区哲戛乡的群众，找到一处100多年来没有人去过的大森林，林内堆砌的泥土、烂树叶和鸟粪有一尺多厚，可以挖出几百万背肥料。新疆维吾尔自治区于阗县三区和五区找到的肥源，使这两个区的11万余亩耕地，三年也用不完。
    有的地区还开展了支援春耕的工作。甘肃省甘南藏族自治州，还以当地的优良马种“河曲马”运往内地，作使用新式农具的畜力。吉林省双阳县手工业生产联社积极建立了新式农具修配网，保证在春耕以前，完成全县新式农具的修配任务。
    在备耕工作中，有的地方党委已经深入乡村，积极领导。
