Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

    I wholeheartedly endorse the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai and the other leaders.

    When I was abroad, I worked in industry and commerce. After returning to the motherland, I engaged in primary school education. Although my work position has changed, my love for the motherland remains the same as before I returned. I am excited and honored to be attending the Second Session of the Second CPPCC National Committee. Before I left, all the teachers and hundreds of children in my school entrusted me to send their greetings to Chairman Mao, wishing him boundless longevity. Now, at this meeting, I request the Presidium to convey these greetings to our most beloved Chairman Mao.

    Originally, I only intended to bring two ears to listen to Chairman Mao and the central leaders, and two eyes to see Chairman Mao and the new construction in Beijing. I hoped to gain something at the meeting and then take it back to Shanghai to give a good account. I didn't plan to say anything, let alone offer any opinions. However, in the past few days, I have heard many important reports at the meeting, and many valuable opinions at each group meeting, which have greatly moved me. In particular, Premier Zhou's political report, from the international situation to the liberation of Taiwan, from national affairs to street vendors, showed us the bright future of the motherland and pointed out the direction for the people of the whole country. Under such excitement and encouragement, I am eager to say a few words at the meeting to express my unstoppable feelings.

    At the CCP Central Committee meeting on January 14, Premier Zhou made a report on the issue of intellectuals. At the meeting on January 31, President Guo Moruo also made a report on the mission of intellectuals in the upsurge of the socialist revolution. Today, as socialism enters its climax, our Party Central Committee has raised the issue of resolving the problems of intellectuals, which is indeed necessary and timely. Regarding the issue of intellectuals, I would like to offer the following immature suggestions for the reference of relevant departments.

    (1) Regarding the utilization and arrangement of intellectuals, the State Council has made very detailed plans and decisions, and Premier Zhou has also issued a call to march towards science. I believe that the people of the whole country warmly support this call. Therefore, I suggest that a universal survey and registration of human resources be conducted in major cities across the country, and then a comprehensive plan for the rational use of human resources be made, so that every intellectual will have the opportunity to develop their expertise in the future and maximize the potential of society. At present, there are also a large number of intellectuals in capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises who are working in fields unrelated to their expertise or whose talents are not being fully utilized, and this situation should also be adjusted as soon as possible.

    (2) In order to expand the ranks of intellectuals, it is necessary to organize and mobilize the vast number of housewives with intellectual backgrounds so that they can also contribute their strength to all social activities. In particular, literacy work is more suitable for housewives with intellectual backgrounds. However, since housewives generally have the burden of housework and children, their participation in social activities is limited. Therefore, I suggest that, wherever possible, the state should establish more nurseries in cities to reduce the burden on women in caring for their children. In this way, they may be able to contribute their strength to socialist construction according to the needs of the country.

    (3) We all know that there are currently many senior intellectuals (Chinese) and technicians staying in Hong Kong and Macau. In order to unite all possible forces, how can we unite them in the future and strive to get them to return to the motherland to serve the country and the cause of socialism? This issue deserves our study.

    (4) With the inevitable arrival of a high tide of culture and science, the country not only needs a large number of senior intellectuals, but also needs to cultivate a large number of well-rounded reserve talents with communist moral qualities (middle and primary school students). And those who are directly responsible for cultivating these reserve talents can only rely on all teachers. However, due to the dark rule of old China, all aspects were very backward, and the education sector was even more backward. Many teachers from the old society, after several years of ideological reform and the constant care and education of the Party, are still continuing to serve the education cause. Their ideological understanding and professional level have improved to varying degrees, but they are still not up to the requirements of the development of the situation. Therefore, I suggest that the state should widely establish teacher training courses, especially primary school teacher training courses, so that teachers can constantly enrich themselves and improve the quality of education.

    I lived abroad for 30 years and suffered from the oppression of imperialism for a long time, which gradually made me numb and prematurely aged. However, in the three years since returning to China, I have witnessed fundamental changes in all aspects of the motherland, rapid changes, changes in society, and changes in people. Old people become young, and young people become even younger. My body and mind have also become active, and I feel 20 years younger than before. In the past, some people liked to say "rejuvenation," but that was just a fantasy. Today, the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao's method of treating diseases and saving people has made it a reality for everyone to rejuvenate.

    Here, as an overseas Chinese, I would like to say a few words to my relatives and fellow countrymen abroad. We overseas Chinese have always loved the motherland and have long been looking forward to a prosperous and strong motherland. Now this wish has been realized under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. However, the country is in a period of large-scale construction, and there are still difficulties. It is impossible to turn one of the most backward countries in the world (old China) into a country as strong as the Soviet Union in just a few years. Therefore, the continued efforts and support of the vast number of people are still needed. Dear patriotic overseas Chinese, now is not the time to shout patriotic slogans, but the time to take practical actions. I suggest that it is necessary to reconsider our understanding of the motherland, strive to contribute our share to the socialist construction of the motherland, and continue to promote the glorious tradition of our overseas Chinese in loving the motherland. The facts are before us. Socialism is a good thing, and communism is an even better thing. It is the law of historical development, the fundamental solution to human problems, and a just cause. There is no need to doubt it, let alone fear it.

    陈失因的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心的拥护周恩来总理和各位首长的报告。
    在国外的时候我在工商界工作，回到祖国以后我是搞小学教育工作，工作岗位改变了，但我热爱祖国的心情，仍和未回国前一样。这次我得列席政协第二届第二次大会，我感到兴奋，也感到光荣。在我未动身前，我校的全体教师和几百名的小朋友都托我带了口信来向毛主席问好，祝毛主席万寿无疆，现在我在大会上，要求主席团把这种口信转达给我们最敬爱的毛主席。
    原来我只想带着二只耳朵来听听毛主席和中央各首长的话，带两只眼睛来看看毛主席和北京的新建设，并希望能在大会上得到一些东西，以后带回上海去作个好好的交代，并不打算说什么话，更没有打算提什么意见。但几天来在大会上我听到了许多重要的报告，和每次小组会议上的许多宝贵意见，给了我很大的激动。特别周总理的政治报告，从国际形势谈到解放台湾，从国家大事谈到肩挑小贩，让我们看到了祖国光辉灿烂的远景，也给全国人民指出了前进的方向。在这样的激动和鼓舞下，我很希望能在大会上说几句话，用来表达我这无可抑止的心情。
    在1月14日中共中央会议上周总理作了关于知识分子问题的报告，31日的大会上郭沫若院长也作了在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告。在社会主义进入最高潮的今天，我们党中央就提出了解决知识分子的问题，这实在是必要的也是适时的。关于知识分子问题，我想提出下列几点不成熟的建议，作为有关部门的参考。
    （1）对于知识分子的使用和安排问题，国务院已作出了很周详的规划和决定，周总理并且作出了向科学大进军的号召，我相信全国人民都热烈的拥护这个号召。因此，我建议在全国的大中城市中进行一次普遍的人力调查登记，然后作出人力合理使用的全面规划，使得每个知识分子在今后都有发挥专长的机会，尽量挖掘社会的潜在力量。目前在资本主义工商业从业人员中也有很多学非所用或用非所长的大量的知识分子，这种情况也应该从速加以调整。
    （2）为了扩大知识分子的队伍，有必要把广大的家庭知识妇女组织和动员起来，使广大的知识妇女也能把力量贡献给一切社会活动。特别是扫盲工作，更适合于家庭知识妇女去搞。但由于家庭知识妇女一般都有家务和孩子的牵累，因此她们对社会的活动也就受到一定的限制。因此我建议，在可能的条件下，国家应在城市中多设托儿所，使妇女们能减轻对孩子的负担。这样，她们就可能根据国家的需要，把力量贡献于社会主义的建设。
    （3）我们大家都知道，目前逗留在港澳（香港、澳门）方面有很多的高级知识分子（中国人）和技术人员，为了团结一切可能团结的力量，今后我们怎样去团结他们，怎样去争取他们回到祖国来为国家服务，为社会主义事业服务，这个问题值得我们研究。
    （4）随着文化、科学高潮的必然到来，国家不但需要大量的高级知识分子，更需要培养大批的全面发展和具有共产主义道德品质的后备人材（中、小学生），而负直接培养这些后备人材的当然只有依靠全体教师。可是由于旧中国的黑暗统治，各方面很落后，教育事业更落后，许多从旧社会里来的教师，几年来经过思想改造和党的不断关怀和教育，目前仍继续为教育事业服务，在思想认识和业务水平都有了不同程度的提高，但毕竟还够不上形势发展的要求。因此我建议，国家应广泛的设立教师进修班，特别是小学教师进修班，使各教师能不断充实自己，提高教育质量。
    我30年居留国外，长期遭受帝国主义者的压迫，使我渐渐变成麻痹，渐渐变成未老先衰。但回国三年来，眼看着祖国各方面都在起着根本的变化，急速的在变化，社会在变化，人也在变化，年老的人变成年青人，年青的人则变得更年青。我的身心也跟着活跃起来，自己觉得比过去要年轻20年。过去有人喜欢说返老还童这句话，那不过是一种幻想，今天中国共产党和毛主席的治病救人的方法，使得人人都能返老还童却是事实。
    这里我以华侨的身分向海外侨胞亲人说几句话。我们华侨一向都是热爱祖国的，都是长期地在盼望着有一个繁荣富强的祖国，现在这种愿望在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下实现了。但国家正在大规模建设的时期，困难还是有的，不可能在短短的几年内就把一个世界上最落后（旧中国）的国家变成像苏联那样强大。因此还必须广大人民的继续努力和支持。亲爱的爱国侨胞们，此刻已不是空喊爱国口号的时候了，而是实际行动的时候了。我向大家建议，有必要重新考虑对祖国的认识，争取在祖国的社会主义事业建设事业中，贡献出我们每一个人的一分力量，继续发扬我们华侨热爱祖国的光荣传统。事实摆在我们面前，社会主义是好事，共产主义更是好事，是历史发展的规律，是解决人类的根本问题，是正义事业，用不着怀疑，更用不着害怕。
