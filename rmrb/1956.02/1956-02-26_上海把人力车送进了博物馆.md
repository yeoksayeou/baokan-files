Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 25th: The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Transportation today sent Shanghai's last two rickshaws to the museum. Former rickshaw pullers held spontaneous gatherings to celebrate this event, thanking the government for eradicating the roots of their poverty and helping them embark on a new life.

Rickshaws first appeared in Japan. As early as 1874, Shanghai also had this means of transportation. Before liberation, there were about 5,000 rickshaws and more than 7,000 rickshaw pullers in Shanghai. After liberation, while developing public transportation, the government systematically helped rickshaw pullers to change professions in batches. Some rickshaw pullers have been trained to become car drivers or skilled workers. Some have returned to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. Elderly workers who had no labor power and no support entered nursing homes. Old worker Jiang Weiqun, 63 years old, who pulled a rickshaw for more than 50 years, is now spending his old age quietly in a nursing home.

    上海把人力车送进了博物馆
    据新华社上海25日电　上海市交通局今天把上海的最后两辆人力车送给了博物馆。原来的人力车工人曾为此自动集会庆祝，感谢政府替他们挖掉了穷根，帮助他们走上新的生活。
    人力车最初出现在日本。远在1874年，上海也有了这种交通工具。解放前夕，上海约有5，000多辆人力车，7，000多人力车工人。解放后，政府在发展公共交通建设的同时，就有计划地帮助人力车工人分批转业。有些人力车工人已经被训练成为汽车驾驶员或技术工人。有的回到农村参加了农业生产。没有劳动力又没有依靠的老年工人进了养老院。63岁的老工人姜威群，拉了50多年人力车，现在他正在养老院里安静地度着晚年。
