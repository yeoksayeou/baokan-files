Xinhua News Agency, February 18th—Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sihanouk declared to more than 50 Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing today that Cambodia will contribute to the realization of fraternal friendship between the peoples of all countries and the ideal of peace cherished by the people of the world by pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality.

The Cambodian Prime Minister said that Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality "has consolidated our independence." Cambodia will continue to implement this policy in order to contribute to the realization of fraternal friendship between countries and the ideal of peace cherished by the people of the world. He hoped that other countries would follow Cambodia's example and that the major powers would have a growing understanding of other countries pursuing such policies, which would help ease international tensions and maintain trust and peace among nations.

Speaking on how to strengthen peaceful cooperation among Asian and African countries and expand the Asian-African peace zone, Prince Sihanouk said, "The Bandung Conference played a very good role in promoting understanding among Asian and African countries, and the results of the conference are continuing to promote the rapprochement of peoples and help consolidate peace." "It would be very good if we could meet again after a certain period of time. Mutual visits, contacts, and consultations are of great benefit to the fraternal friendship of Asian countries and to peace in Asia and the world."

When asked about reconvening the Geneva Conference on Indochina, Prince Sihanouk replied that he believed "contact between countries is always beneficial" and hoped that the relevant countries participating in the Geneva Conference would consult to resolve the outstanding issues in the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam and Laos. Prince Sihanouk also spoke about Cambodia's implementation of the Geneva Accords when answering reporters' questions.

When discussing Cambodia's attitude toward the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," Prince Sihanouk said: "Cambodia is neutral, and the people demand that I maintain neutrality. We maintain neutrality toward everyone." He went on to say, "They (the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) told us that they would automatically protect us, and we rejected this protection because such protection is not honorable."

Speaking of strengthening the long-standing friendship and ties between China and Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk said: "The time is ripe for China and Cambodia to establish direct contact." He continued, "I held talks with Premier Zhou Enlai and agreed to establish contact between our two countries and develop cooperation between the two countries, especially in the cultural and economic fields. As for the political aspect, there will be more contact in the future, such as mutual visits and direct contact, which will help strengthen cooperation between the two countries."

Regarding Sino-Cambodian trade relations, Prince Sihanouk said: "China and Cambodia have decided to develop trade relations. Because my visit is short, it is impossible to study this issue in detail. More contact is needed in the future, especially between relevant experts and officials. Cambodia is interested in countries willing to trade with it. China is such a country. Cambodia has goods for export, which is beneficial to both Cambodia and the Chinese people. China also has many things that can be exchanged with Cambodia. The remaining issue is for both parties to compare the lists of goods, which can be done in the near future."

When asked how to promote cultural exchange between the two countries, Prince Sihanouk hoped that China would send art troupes to Cambodia. He said that Cambodia will do its best to promote cultural exchange between the two countries.

Speaking about his impressions of Beijing, Prince Sihanouk said that during the visit, he gained a very good impression of the Chinese People's Government's commitment to promoting the welfare of the people and the ability of the Chinese people. He said: "The People's Government is working to heal the wounds of war, revive the motherland, and ensure the happiness and peace of the people through the revival of the motherland." He congratulated the Chinese people on their construction achievements.

Prince Sihanouk also spoke about his impressions of Chinese youth. He said that in his contact with Chinese youth, he felt that Chinese youth are healthy, full of confidence, and have fraternal feelings for China's neighbors.

    西哈努克在北京举行记者招待会
    新华社18日讯　柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王今天向北京的中外记者50多人宣称，柬埔寨将以执行和平中立的政策，来对实现各国人民之间的兄弟友谊和世界人民所珍视的和平理想作出贡献。
    这位柬埔寨首相说，柬埔寨执行的和平中立政策“巩固了我们的独立”。柬埔寨将继续执行这种政策，以此来对实现各国之间兄弟般的友谊和世界人民所珍视的和平理想作出贡献。他希望其他国家能效法柬埔寨的榜样，并且希望大国能对执行这种政策的其他国家有越来越多的了解，这样就将有助于缓和国际紧张局势，维护各国信任与和平。
    在谈到如何加强亚非各国的和平合作和扩大亚非和平地区的时候，西哈努克亲王说，“万隆会议对亚非国家的了解起了很好的作用，会议的结果正继续促进各国人民的接近，有助于巩固和平。”“如果我们能够相隔一定时期再次集会是很好的。相互的访问、接触、协商，对于亚洲国家的兄弟友谊，对亚洲和世界和平有着很大的好处。”
    有记者问到关于重新召开有关印度支那问题的日内瓦会议，西哈努克亲王回答说，他认为“各国之间的接触总是有好处的”，并且希望参加日内瓦会议的有关各国进行磋商来解决关于在越南和老挝执行日内瓦协议中遗留的问题。西哈努克亲王在答复记者问题的时候还谈到了柬埔寨执行日内瓦协议的情况。
    西哈努克亲王在谈到柬埔寨对待“东南亚条约组织”的态度的时候说：“柬埔寨是中立的，人民要求我维持中立。我们对任何人都保持着中立。”他接着说，“它们（东南亚条约组织）对我们说它们将自动地保护我们，我们拒绝了这种保护，因为这种保护是不光荣的。”
    在谈到中国和柬埔寨两国增进久已存在的友谊和联系时，西哈努克亲王说：“现在中柬建立直接接触时机已经成熟”。他接着说，“我和周恩来总理举行了会谈、同意我们两国之间建立联系和发展两国之间的合作，特别是文化、经济方面的合作。至于政治方面，今后将会有更多接触，例如互相访问和直接接触，这些接触将有助于加强两国之间的合作。”
    关于中柬贸易关系，西哈努克亲王说：“中柬已决定开展贸易关系。因为我的访问时间短促，不可能对这个问题详细研究，以后需要更多的接触，特别是有关的专家和官员之间的接触。柬埔寨对愿意和它进行贸易的国家都感到兴趣。中国正是这样一个国家。柬埔寨自己有货物出口，这对柬埔寨和中国人民都有利。中国也有很多东西可以和柬埔寨交换。现在遗留的问题就是双方对照货单，这件事在不久的将来即可进行。”
    有记者问到如何促进两国的文化交流时，西哈努克亲王希望中国派艺术团到柬埔寨去。他表示柬埔寨将尽力促进两国之间的文化交流。
    西哈努克亲王在谈到对北京的印象时说：在参观过程中，他对中国人民政府致力于促进人民福利和中国人民的能力，都获得了很好的印象。他说：“人民政府正在致力于医治战争创伤、复兴祖国，并通过祖国的复兴来保证人民的幸福和和平。”他对中国人民的建设成就表示祝贺。
    西哈努克亲王还谈到对中国青年的印象，他说：在他和中国青年的接触中，他觉得中国青年是健康的，他们充满着信心和对中国的邻国的兄弟情谊。
