    Celebrating the 38th Anniversary of the Founding of the Soviet Army
    Soviet Army Major General P. Musyakov

    This year, on February 23rd, the Soviet people will celebrate the 38th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army and Navy.

    The Soviet armed forces were established to protect the interests of the world's first socialist country and have grown and strengthened in the fierce battles against domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces. The Soviet army was able to achieve victory because it originated from the people, defended the vital interests of the people, and was cherished by the entire nation. The soldiers and sailors of the Soviet army are the bravest soldiers. The Communist Party, with liberation as its war aim, educated them to be so brave. Lenin once said that such an army, when its soldiers clearly know why they are fighting, cannot be defeated by anyone. And the Soviet soldiers knew why and against whom they were fighting.

    After the end of the civil war, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin said at the Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets: "We have ended one war and should prepare to meet the second war, but we do not know when the second war will come, we must do so in order to be able to prevail when it comes" (see "Lenin's Collected Works," Russian edition, Vol. 31, p. 470). The Communist Party strictly implemented Lenin's call, and cared for all the demands that the Soviet state's armed forces could put forward at any time to ensure national security.

    The period of the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War was not only a period of growth in the political and economic power of the Soviet state, but also a period of consolidation of the armed forces of the socialist state. The successful completion of the pre-war five-year plans enabled the Soviet state to equip the Soviet army with first-class combat technology.

    The Great Patriotic War was the most brutal and arduous war in history. This war began with the sudden treacherous attack on the Soviet Union by the fascist bandits. During this period, Hitler's Germany and its allies were superior to the Soviet Union. The fascist bandits mobilized 170 divisions in advance and pushed this army to the Soviet border, launching sudden attacks in places favorable to them. The enemy had many planes and tanks. The fascist bandits had two years of modern warfare experience. Fascist Germany also had an advantage in material terms, with almost all the conquered European countries and many "neutral" countries working for its army. The fascist bandits used these temporary advantages to occupy a large part of Soviet territory. While fighting hard battles, the Soviet army retreated to the rear of the country, ensuring the mobilization of its armed forces and the transformation of industry to wartime norms. The Soviet people responded to the Party's call and united to defend their homeland.

    The heroism and tenacious bravery of the officers and soldiers of the Soviet army were characteristic of the entire course of the Great Patriotic War. They showed the world that the Soviet people were able to defend their homeland. The mass labor feats of the Soviet people in the rear were also very brilliant in this war. As a result of the Soviet people's great achievements, Soviet military production increased many times over in a short period of time, greatly exceeding that of fascist Germany. In Moscow and Stalingrad, in the Caucasus Mountains, in Ukraine, Belarus, and on the Baltic coast, and finally in the march to liberate European countries, and during the Battle of Berlin, the Soviet people showed their superiority over the enemy everywhere.

    As a result of crushing fascist Germany and liberating many countries from Hitler's enslavement, the prestige of the Soviet armed forces was further enhanced. The victory over fascist Germany showed the world how great and invincible power the socialist system, which eliminated capitalism and the exploitation of man by man, gave to our people and army!

    Our country's international prestige has also been unprecedentedly enhanced. Now our country, together with the People's Republic of China, leads a powerful democratic and socialist camp including 12 countries and 900 million people. The democratic socialist camp is now a huge force preventing reactionary groups in certain countries from launching a new world war.

    The Soviet government is doing everything possible to ease international tensions and prevent new wars from happening. Representing the will of the people, it put forward proposals for disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons at the Geneva Four-Power Summit. Now the Soviet Union, following the spirit of the Geneva Four-Power Summit resolutions, has reduced its armed forces by 640,000 men and withdrawn its last military base abroad – the Porkkala Peninsula in Finland, and this year's military expenditure has been reduced by almost 10 billion rubles.

    However, these peace-loving measures have not been actively responded to by the other participants in the Geneva Four-Power Summit. The aggressive bloc countries are still increasing their military budgets as before, and are establishing new military bases in foreign countries and near the peaceful democratic camp countries. Under these circumstances, it is completely natural for the Communist Party and the Soviet government to constantly care about strengthening our national defense forces.

    The Soviet Army and Navy are forever the fortress of peace, friendship, and unity of all nationalities. The glorious Soviet armed forces, which have won great victories, vigilantly defend the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people.

    庆祝苏联建军节38周年
    苏联陆军少将　普·穆西雅科夫
    今年2月23日苏联人民将庆祝苏联陆、海军建军38周年。
    苏联武装力量是为保护世界上第一个社会主义国家的利益而建立起来，是在同国内外反革命势力的残酷战斗中成长和壮大起来的。苏联军队所以能够获得胜利是因为它是从人民中间产生的，捍卫了人民的切身利益，受到了全民的爱护。苏联军队的士兵和水兵们都是最勇敢的军人。以解放为战争目的的共产党把他们教育成为这样勇敢的人。列宁曾说，这样的军队，在它的士兵清楚地知道他们为什么而斗争的时候，是任何人也不能战胜它的。而苏联的军人们都知道为什么和反对谁而进行战斗的。
    在国内战争结束后，弗·伊·列宁在第八次全俄苏维埃代表大会上曾说：“我们结束了一个战争，应当准备迎接第二个战争，可是，我们不知道第二次战争什么时候到来，我们必须这样做，以便当它到来时我们能够占上风”（见“列宁全集”，俄文版第31卷，470页）。共产党严格地执行了列宁的这一号召，关怀苏维埃国家武装力量能够随时执行保障国家安全任务提出的一切要求。
    国内战争和伟大卫国战争时期不仅是苏维埃国家政治、经济威力成长的时期，而且还是社会主义国家武装力量巩固的时期。战前的几个五年计划的顺利完成，使苏维埃国家能以头等的战斗技术装备苏联军队。
    伟大卫国战争是历史上最残酷、最艰巨的一次战争。这次战争是以法西斯强盗背信弃义向苏联突然进攻开始的。在这个时期，希特勒德国和它的同盟国同苏联比较起来是占优势的。法西斯匪徒们预先动员了170个师的军队，并把这军队推进到苏联国境，在对他们有利的地方进行了突然进攻。敌人曾拥有许多飞机和坦克。法西斯强盗具有两年现代化战争的经验。在物质方面法西斯德国也占优势，几乎所有被它征服的欧洲国家和许多“中立”国都为它的军队工作。法西斯强盗们利用这些暂时的优越条件占领了苏联的很大一部分领土。苏联军队一面进行着艰苦的战斗，一面退到了国家的大后方，保证了动员自己的武装力量和把工业改造到战时规范的工作。苏联人民响应了党的号召，团结一致地奋起保卫自己祖国的土地。
    苏联军队官兵的英雄主义、英勇顽强是伟大卫国战争全部过程中的特点。他们向全世界表明了苏联人民是能够捍卫自己的祖国的。苏联人民在后方的群众性的劳动功绩在这次战争中也是非常辉煌的。由于苏联人民建树了丰功伟绩的结果，在短短的时间内，使苏联的军事生产增加了好多倍，大大超过了法西斯德国的军事生产。在莫斯科和斯大林格勒城，在高加索山上，在乌克兰、白俄罗斯以及在波罗的海沿岸，最后在解放欧洲各国的进军中，在柏林大会战的时候，苏联人民到处都展示出了他们对敌人的优势。
      由于粉碎了法西斯德国和从希特勒奴役下解放了许多国家的结果，苏联武装力量的威信更加提高了。战胜法西斯德国的胜利向全世界表明：消灭了资本主义和人剥削人现象的社会主义制度给予了我国人民和军队多么巨大的不可战胜的力量啊！
    我们祖国的国际威望也空前提高了。现在我们的祖国和中华人民共和国一道领导着包括12个国家和9亿人口的强大的民主和社会主义阵营。民主社会主义阵营现在是阻止某些国家反动集团发动新的世界大战的巨大力量。
    苏联政府尽一切力量缓和着国际紧张局势，防止新战争的发生。它代表人民的意志在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上提出了裁减军备和禁止核子武器的建议。现在苏联遵循着日内瓦四国政府首脑会议决议的精神把自己的武装力量减少了64万人，撤出了它在国外的最后一个军事基地——芬兰的波卡拉半岛，今年的军费几乎减少了100亿卢布。
    然而这些爱好和平的措施未受到日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的其他参加国的积极响应。侵略集团各国还和从前一样不断增加着军事预算，在外国、在和平民主阵营各国附近建立着新的军事基地。在这种情况下，共产党和苏联政府不断关怀加强我国国防力量是完全自然的事情。
    苏联的陆、海军永远是各族人民和平、友谊和团结的堡垒。曾获得伟大胜利的光荣的苏联武装力量警惕地保卫着苏联人民的和平的创造性劳动。
