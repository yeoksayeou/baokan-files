    Congratulations to Comrade Voroshilov on his 75th Birthday
    Today is the 75th birthday of Comrade Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov, an outstanding activist of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state, and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. The Chinese people extend warm congratulations on the birthday of this close friend.
    Comrade Voroshilov's life and activities are inseparable from the history of the great Soviet Communist Party. He was born into a worker's family, and began revolutionary activities in his youth, participating in the groups of Russian Social Democrats. From the very beginning of joining the Party, he adhered to the Bolshevik line of Lenin and unswervingly implemented this line throughout his life. He was a loyal student of Lenin and a closest comrade-in-arms of Stalin. The Chinese people, like the Soviet people, have always deeply loved and respected this passionate warrior who fought for the cause of communism throughout his life.
    Comrade Voroshilov was an active participant in the first Russian revolution of 1905-1907, leading strikes by Lugansk workers and peasant struggles. At the Fourth (Unity) Party Congress in 1906, he met Lenin and Stalin for the first time. In the following years, he was repeatedly arrested, imprisoned, and exiled by the Tsarist government, but he still managed to escape several times to continue revolutionary work with greater energy. During the preparation and execution of the Great October Revolution, he carried out tremendous work.
    Comrade Voroshilov made outstanding contributions to the establishment and strengthening of the Soviet armed forces, the consolidation of Soviet defense capabilities, and the defense of the Soviet state. During the Civil War, the Party Central Committee and Lenin often sent Comrade Voroshilov to important areas of struggle against the enemy. Under the leadership of Lenin, he and Stalin successfully completed the tasks assigned to him by the Party. Comrade Voroshilov had great merits in defending Tsaritsyn, annihilating the Denikin and Wrangel White armies, and in suppressing the Kronstadt counter-revolutionary rebellion. After the Civil War, he continued to work for the development and consolidation of the Soviet army. As the leader of the Soviet armed forces, he devoted all his energy to enhancing the combat power of the Soviet army and consolidating Soviet defense capabilities.
    During the Great Patriotic War, Comrade Voroshilov actively participated in leading the Soviet army in combat and implementing plans to defeat the German fascist aggressors. Later, he also participated in the Soviet, British, and American tripartite conference held in Moscow in 1941 and the Soviet, American, and British summit conference held in Tehran in 1943.
    Comrade Voroshilov is an active activist of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state. He has been elected as a member of the Party Central Committee since the Tenth Party Congress. He has been elected as a member of the Politburo of the Party Central Committee since 1926. In March 1946, he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers. After the 19th Congress of the CPSU in 1952, he was elected as a member of the Presidium of the Party Central Committee. In March 1953, he was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Currently, in this glorious position, he is working tirelessly with other leaders of the Party and the government to lead the Soviet people in realizing the communist construction plan, consolidating world peace and promoting international cooperation.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, the Soviet people have achieved tremendous accomplishments in developing the national economy and carrying out communist construction. The Soviet people have completed the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and the completion of this plan has greatly increased the economic strength of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. The recently announced draft of the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan is a new magnificent plan for the Soviet people to build communism. According to this plan, the Soviet Union will further vigorously develop all sectors of the national economy, rapidly develop agricultural production, and strive to greatly improve the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people on this basis, based on prioritizing the development of heavy industry, continuously developing technology and improving labor productivity. The realization of this plan will enable the Soviet people to take a further step on the road to building communism. The strong upsurge of the Soviet economy has further strengthened the confidence and determination of the Chinese people to build socialism, and brought infinite encouragement to the Chinese people.
    The Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, following Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence, have made great contributions to the cause of consolidating world peace and promoting international cooperation. Over the past year, the Soviet Union has taken a series of new measures in diplomacy, improved international relations, strengthened international cooperation, and eased international tensions. Recently, the various measures proposed by the Soviet Union and other eight governments in the declaration of the Warsaw Treaty Organization on promoting the establishment of a European collective security system, and Chairman Bulganin's proposal to President Eisenhower in a letter on the conclusion of a Soviet-American treaty of friendship and cooperation, fully conform to the wishes of the people of all countries and open up new avenues for consolidating world peace and promoting international cooperation. The Chinese people resolutely support and fully support the unremitting efforts made by the Soviet Union in international tensions and strengthening international cooperation.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has undergone new developments. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed by the governments of China and the Soviet Union in 1950 marked a new stage in the development of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The results of the talks held in Beijing in 1954 between the Soviet government delegation headed by Khrushchev and our government are further proof of the unbreakable friendship and fraternal cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people. Historical facts over the past six years have proven that the strong alliance between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful factor in safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world, and is of great significance for the rapid development of our national economy. At present, in the socialist construction of our country, we are receiving the selfless fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union everywhere. Comrade Voroshilov once said: "The Chinese people are not isolated. They have the guarantee that they can always obtain the full and unconditional support of the Soviet people who are extremely willing to hand over all their experience to accelerate China's socialist construction," "Our friendship, our hearts, our selfless fraternal assistance are forever with you." Comrade Voroshilov's words profoundly express the deep fraternal friendship of the entire Soviet people towards the Chinese people.
    At present, our people are rapidly striding forward on the road to socialism. Hundreds of millions of farmers in our country have launched a high tide of agricultural cooperation, and the high tide of handicrafts cooperation and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce have also followed. This new development situation provides very favorable conditions for the rapid development of socialist industrialization in our country and the new upsurge of the national economy, making it entirely possible for our country to complete socialist transformation ahead of schedule, and complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. Comrade Mao Zedong has predicted: "In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed throughout the country." Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union's selfless fraternal assistance is an indispensable condition for the Chinese people to accelerate the completion of the socialist revolution.
    The brilliant achievements made by the Soviet people in consolidating world peace and building communism, and the development and consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, are inseparable from the correct leadership of the leaders of the Soviet Party and government. Today, on the occasion of Comrade Voroshilov's 75th birthday, the Chinese people, with infinite respect, sincerely wish him a long life. We congratulate him on achieving greater success in strengthening the peace and friendship of the people of all countries and promoting the further prosperity of Soviet society and the further improvement of the people's welfare. We congratulate the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people on becoming more consolidated. We congratulate China and the Soviet Union on strengthening unity and cooperation and achieving new victories in the struggle to maintain and consolidate world peace. (Attached picture)

    祝贺伏罗希洛夫同志75岁寿辰
    今天是苏联共产党和苏维埃国家杰出的活动家、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席克利门特·叶弗列莫维奇·伏罗希洛夫同志的75寿辰。中国人民对这位亲密的朋友的寿辰表示热烈的祝贺。
    伏罗希洛夫同志一生的生活和活动是同伟大的苏联共产党的历史分不开的。他出生在一个工人的家庭里，在少年时代他就开始了革命活动，参加了俄国社会民主党人的小组。从参加党的最初的日子起，他就坚持了布尔什维克的列宁的路线，并且在一生中始终不渝地执行着这个路线。他是列宁的忠实的学生和斯大林的最亲密的战友。中国人民和苏联人民一样，一向对这位毕生为共产主义事业而奋斗的热情战士深深地热爱和尊敬。
    伏罗希洛夫同志是1905—1907年第一次俄国革命的积极参加者，他曾领导了鲁干斯克工人的罢工和农民的斗争。在1906年召开的第四次（统一）党代表大会上，他第一次会见了列宁和斯大林。其后几年间，他曾屡次被沙皇政府逮捕、监禁和流放，但是，他仍然几次设法逃出来，以更大的精力继续进行革命工作。在准备和进行伟大的十月革命期间，他进行了巨大的工作。
    在建立和加强苏联武装力量，巩固苏联国防力量，保卫苏维埃国家的工作中，伏罗希洛夫同志有卓越的贡献。在国内战争时期，党中央和列宁常把伏罗希洛夫同志派到对敌人斗争的重要地区去。在列宁的领导下，他和斯大林一起成功地完成了党交给他的任务。在保卫察里津、歼灭邓尼金和弗兰格尔白卫军的战斗中以及在平服喀朗施塔得反革命叛乱的工作中，伏罗希洛夫同志都有很大的功绩。国内战争结束后，他一直为发展和巩固苏联军队而工作。作为苏联武装部队的领导人，他以全部的精力来提高苏联军队的战斗力量和巩固苏联国防力量。
    在伟大的卫国战争期间，伏罗希洛夫同志积极参加了领导苏联军队作战和实现击溃德国法西斯侵略者的计划的工作。后来，他又参加了1941年在莫斯科举行的苏、英、美三国代表会议和1943年在德黑兰举行的苏、美、英三国首脑会议。
    伏罗希洛夫同志是苏联共产党和苏维埃国家的积极活动家。从党的第十次代表大会起他就被选为党中央委员会委员。从1926年起被选为党中央委员会政治局委员。1946年3月，他被任命为苏联部长会议副主席。1952年苏共第十九次代表大会以后他被选为党中央委员会主席团委员。1953年3月他又被选为苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席。目前，他正在这个光荣的岗位上，同党和政府的其他领导人一起，领导着苏联人民，为实现共产主义建设计划，巩固世界和平和促进国际合作而不倦地工作着。
    近年来，苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，在发展国民经济、进行共产主义建设方面获得了巨大的成就。苏联人民已经提前完成了第五个五年计划，这个计划的完成大大增加了苏联和整个社会主义阵营的经济实力。最近公布的苏联第六个五年计划草案，是苏联人民建设共产主义的新的宏伟的计划。根据这个计划，苏联将在优先发展重工业、不断发展技术和提高劳动生产率的基础上，进一步大力发展国民经济的各部门，急速发展农业生产，并且在这个基础上争取大大提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平。这个计划的实现，将使苏联人民在建设共产主义的道路上更加前进一步。苏联经济的强大高涨，更加坚定了中国人民建设社会主义的信心和决心，给中国人民带来了无限的鼓舞力量。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府遵循着列宁的和平共处的原则，对于巩固世界和平和促进国际合作的事业作出了巨大的贡献。过去一年中，苏联在外交上采取了一系列的新的措施，改善了国际关系，加强了国际合作，使国际紧张局势趋于缓和。最近，苏联等八国政府在华沙友好合作互助条约缔约国宣言中提出的关于促进建立欧洲集体安全体系的各种措施和布尔加宁主席给艾森豪威尔信中关于缔结苏美友好合作条约的建议，完全符合各国人民的愿望，为巩固世界和平和促进国际合作开辟了新的道路。中国人民坚决拥护和完全支持苏联在国际紧张局势和加强国际合作方面所作的坚持不懈的努力。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以来，中苏两国人民的友谊有了新的发展。1950年中苏两国政府签订的友好同盟互助条约标志着中苏两国人民友谊发展的新阶段。1954年以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联政府代表团和我国政府在北京举行会谈的成果，是中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊和兄弟般的合作进一步巩固的证明。六年来的历史事实证明，中苏两国强大的同盟是保卫远东和世界和平的有力的因素，对于迅速发展我国国民经济具有重大的意义。目前，在我国的社会主义建设中，无处不受到苏联的大公无私的兄弟般的援助。伏罗希洛夫同志曾经说过：“中国人民不是孤立的。他们已有保证，他们可以永远获得极愿随时交出自己的全部经验以加速中国的社会主义建设的苏维埃人民的全力的和无条件的支持，”“我们的友谊，我们的心，我们的大公无私的兄弟般的援助是永远和你们在一起的。”伏罗希洛夫同志的这些话深刻地表达了全体苏联人民对中国人民的深厚的兄弟般的友谊。
    目前我国人民正在向社会主义的道路迅速地大踏步地前进。我国几万万农民已经掀起了农业合作化运动的高潮，而手工业合作化和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮也已经随之到来。这种新的发展形势，为我国社会主义工业化的迅速发展和国民经济的新的高涨提供了十分有利的条件，使我国完全有可能提早完成社会主义改造，提早和超额完成第一个五年计划。毛泽东同志已经预言：“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。”无疑地，苏联的大公无私的兄弟般的援助，是我国人民加速完成社会主义革命不可缺少的条件。
    苏联人民在巩固世界和平、建设共产主义的斗争中所获得的辉煌的成就和中苏人民友谊的发展和巩固，是同苏联党和政府的领导人的正确领导分不开的。今天，欣逢伏罗希洛夫同志的75寿辰，中国人民怀着无限的敬意，衷心地祝贺他万寿无疆。祝贺他在加强各国人民的和平和友谊、促进苏维埃社会的进一步繁荣和人民福利的进一步提高而获得更大的成就。祝贺中苏两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊更加巩固。祝贺中苏两国在维护和巩固世界和平的斗争中更加团结合作并获得新的胜利。（附图片）
