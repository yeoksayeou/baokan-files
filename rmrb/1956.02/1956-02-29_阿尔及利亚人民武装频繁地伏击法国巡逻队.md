    Xinhua News Agency, February 28th, Paris Dispatch: The tense situation in Algeria is constantly escalating. French patrols are being ambushed by the Algerian People's Armed Forces with increasing frequency. On February 26th, the Algerian People's Armed Forces engaged in battles with French troops near Sidi-Ech and in Kabylie and other regions. On the same day, Muslims in Alan held demonstrations against French colonial rule.
    On the 27th, the French cabinet held a meeting to discuss the Algerian issue. The French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, requested at the meeting that more troops be sent to Algeria to suppress the local national liberation movement. A communique issued after the cabinet meeting stated that the French cabinet decided to request special powers from the National Assembly to deal with the Algerian issue.
    The French public is expressing unease about the situation in Algeria. "L'Humanité" pointed out that if the French ruling clique continues to pursue a policy of colonial suppression, "the Algerian war could become a full-scale war." "L'Humanité" said that measures such as sending more troops to Algeria will only make the resolution of the Algerian issue more difficult.

    阿尔及利亚人民武装频繁地伏击法国巡逻队
    新华社28日讯　巴黎消息：阿尔及利亚的紧张局势正在不断加剧。法国巡逻队越来越频繁地遭到阿尔及利亚人民武装部队的伏击。2月26日，阿尔及利亚人民武装部队在西迪—埃许城附近、在卡毕利和其他地区同法军发生战斗。在同一天，阿兰的回教徒举行了反对法国殖民统治的示威。
    27日，法国内阁举行会议讨论阿尔及利亚问题。法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特在会议上要求继续增派军队到阿尔及利亚去镇压当地的民族解放运动。内阁会议后发表的公报说，法国内阁决定请求国民议会给予特殊权力来处理阿尔及利亚问题。
    法国公众对阿尔及利亚局势表示不安，“人道报”指出，如果法国统治集团继续执行殖民镇压政策，“阿尔及利亚战争可以成为全面的战争。”“人道报”说，像增派军队到阿尔及利亚去的那种措施只会使阿尔及利亚问题的解决更加困难。
