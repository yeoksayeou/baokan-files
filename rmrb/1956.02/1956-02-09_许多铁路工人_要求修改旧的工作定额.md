Many Railway Workers
Demand Revision of Old Work Norms

    An increasing number of railway workers are requesting the Ministry of Railways to revise production targets and work norms in an effort to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    Yue Shangwu, the driver of the nationally renowned "Mao Zedong" locomotive, was the first to propose a suggestion to the Beijing Railway Bureau at the end of December: he requested an increase in the weight standard for freight trains between Fengtai and Nancang on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan railway. He believed that the standard set by the Ministry of Railways was lagging behind the actual capabilities of train drivers. Most train drivers could exceed this standard without much effort. If the standard were raised, each train could carry at least 300 tons more, which would be of great benefit to the exchange of goods between inside and outside the pass. The Beijing Railway Bureau quickly accepted Yue Shangwu's suggestion and increased the weight standard for freight trains on this railway by 300 tons, effective January 24. It also simultaneously raised the train weight standards on other lines under the Beijing Railway Bureau's jurisdiction.
    Following Yue Shangwu's lead, an increasing number of suggestions from railway workers across the country have been made, requesting revisions to work-hour quotas and freight train weight standards. The Shanghai Railway Bureau's workers have already submitted 2,900 suggestions for revising work-hour quotas. Employees of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau have put forward over 7,000 suggestions for revising outdated work-hour quotas. (Xinhua News Agency report)

    许多铁路工人
    要求修改旧的工作定额
    越来越多的铁路工人要求铁道部修改生产指标和工作定额，争取提前完成五年计划。
    全国著名的“毛泽东号”机车的司机长岳尚武12月底最先向北京铁路管理局提出了一项建议：他要求提高北京山海关铁路丰台到南仓之间的货物列车重量标准。他认为铁道部规定的标准已经落后于火车司机的实际水平。大多数火车司机不太费力就可以超过这个标准。如果把标准提高，每趟列车至少可以多拉300吨，这对于关内外的物资交流有很大好处。北京铁路管理局迅速接受了岳尚武的建议，并且从1月24日起把这条铁路的货物列车重量标准提高了300吨。还同时提高了北京铁路管理局所属的其他各线的列车重量标准。
    继岳尚武之后，全国各地铁路工人要求修改工时定额和货物列车重量标准的建议越来越多。上海铁路管理局的工人群众已经提出了2，900件修改工时定额的建议。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局职工们提出了7，000多件修改落后工时定额的建议。（据新华社讯）
