I am visiting the people's capital for the first time, attending the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a nonvoting delegate, and my heart is filled with indescribable excitement. To be able to see our beloved Chairman Mao in person, to hear Premier Zhou's political report and the special reports of the leaders, is like being given endless heat and encouragement. I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support these reports and instructions.

I am a technician in local industry, and I would like to briefly talk about my feelings in the great torrent of the socialist revolution!

The main task of local industry is to serve the needs of local agricultural production and rural life. This is the noble task that the Party has given to everyone engaged in local industry. After repeatedly reading Premier Zhou's report on agricultural cooperation and the National Agricultural 12-Year Development Program, the Party's great call to basically complete the socialist agricultural cooperation in three years is very inspiring. Thus, it points out a clear direction and broad prospects for local industry, and will inevitably cause a new upsurge of great leaps forward on the industrial front in a very short period of time. Taking Sichuan as an example, the current upsurge of agricultural cooperation has reflected that the increase in the production of phosphate fertilizer, farm tools, and coal is very urgent. Taking coal as an example, Sichuan has nearly 80 million people. As a result of rural greening and the use of straw to accumulate fertilizer, a large number of people need to switch to burning coal. Assuming that at least 70% of the population burns an average of one jin of coal per person per day, it would be more than 10 million tons per year. In addition to industrial coal consumption, the number is naturally even larger and more alarming. No one dreamed of this sudden increase in demand last year. This brings extremely difficult and glorious tasks to our local industry. Chairman Mao said, "We are doing an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before." This requires us to catch up quickly, break the rules, use revolutionary means and combat methods to quickly push Sichuan's local industry to a climax, and produce more, better, and more economical products to meet the urgent needs of the countryside.

It is not difficult to imagine how important the role that we intellectuals and all engineering and technical personnel should play in socialist construction. We need to contribute all our strength and walk at the forefront of construction, fighting tenaciously and bravely. Therefore, on the issue of intellectuals raised by the Party and Chairman Mao's wise and timely manner, I sincerely put forward my two wishes to the Party and this conference.

First, bravely throw yourself into the upsurge of ideological remolding of intellectuals, let the furnace remelt yourself, and forge yourself into iron and steel. Always remember the solemn and enthusiastic call of President Guo Moruo that "every intellectual should demand himself according to the standards of a Communist Party member." Better accept the leadership and education of the Party, strive to be approved as a glorious Communist Party member, and dedicate yourself to the cause of the Party forever.

Second, actively improve technical and professional skills. The trend of rapid expansion of local industry in Sichuan reflects that technical personnel are not only of low quality and insufficient in quantity, but also, in particular, the number of mid-level technical personnel is even more seriously insufficient. In the past, we extremely neglected the training of new forces, and only thought that we were still too late to study hard, so how could we have time to take apprentices and run training classes? We completely did not understand the principle of mutual influence between quantity and quality, that is, training more technical cadres would naturally improve our own technical quality, and at the same time, it would better share some of our technical work and reduce the phenomenon of a small number of people being busy day and night with little effect. In this regard, training technical cadres is already a matter of urgency. I am willing to make the most intense efforts, strive to expand our team, and move forward to improve my own level.

    李纪泽的发言
    我是第一次来到人民的首都，列席参加全国政治协商会议，内心上实在是说不出的兴奋。能够亲眼看到敬爱的毛主席，亲耳听到周总理的政治报告和各位首长的专题报告，就像给予我无限的热力和鼓舞，我是衷心地、热情地拥护这些报告和指示的。
    我是一个在地方工业中的技术人员，我想简单的谈一谈我在社会主义革命伟大的洪流中我的感触吧！
    地方工业的主要任务是为当地农业生产和农村生活的需要服务，这是党给予每一个从事地方工业的崇高任务。再三读过周总理报告中关于农业合作化部分，及全国农业12年的发展纲要以后，党提出经过3年的时间，就可以基本上完成全社会主义的农业合作化的伟大号召，令人十分振奋。从而就对地方工业指出了明确的方向，宽阔的前途，在很短的时期内必然会引起一次在工业战线上的大踏步前进的新的高潮。拿四川的情况来说，目前农业合作化的高潮，已经反映出磷肥、农具和煤炭的增产是十分紧迫的。以煤为例，四川约近8，000万人口，农村绿化和利用稻草积肥的结果，大量需要改烧煤炭。假定至少按70％的人口、每人每天平均烧煤一市斤来计算，每年就该1，000多万吨；加上工业燃煤，数字自然更大，更是惊人。这种突然需要增加的数字，在去年是谁都没有梦想到的。这就给我们地方工业带来极其艰巨的而又极其光荣的任务。毛主席说过“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”，这就需要我们急起直追，打破常规，用革命的手段、战斗的方法，迅速的把四川地方工业推向高潮，生产出更多更好更省的产品来满足农村紧急的需要。
    不难想像，我们知识分子，一切工程技术人员，在社会主义建设中所应起的作用是如何的重要。需要我们贡献出一切力量，走在建设的最前哨，顽强勇敢的战斗着。因此，在党和毛主席英明的、及时的提出的知识分子问题上，我诚恳的向党向这次大会，提出我的两点心愿。
    第一、勇敢的把自己投入知识分子思想改造的高潮中去，让炼炉把自己重新融化一下，要炼成铁，炼成钢。时时刻刻记住郭沫若院长提出的“每一个知识分子都应当以共产党员的标准要求自己”的庄严的热情的号召。更好的接受党的领导和教育，争取批准为一个光荣的共产党员，永远的献身于党的事业。
    第二、积极的提高技术业务水平。四川地方工业迅速扩张的趋势，反映到技术人员，不仅是质量低，数量不足的现象，特别是中级技术人员，数量不足更严重。过去我们极端忽视新生力量的培训，只认为自己加紧学习还来不赢，那有时间去带徒弟、办训练班呢？我们是完全不理解数量与质量相互影响的道理，即是说培养了更多的技术干部，自然也会提高了自己的技术质量，同时也会更好的分担了自己的一部分技术工作，减少了集中少数人的日夜忙乱、效果不大等现象。这在目前来说，训练技术干部已经是刻不容缓了。我愿意作到最紧张的努力，为扩大我们的队伍而奋斗，为提高自己的水平而前进。
