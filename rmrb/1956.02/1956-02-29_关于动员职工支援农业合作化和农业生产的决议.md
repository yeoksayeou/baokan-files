The publication of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the "Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" has promoted the high tide of the national rural cooperative movement and greatly inspired the enthusiasm of workers and staff across the country for building socialism. At the same time, the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement requires workers and staff across the country to accelerate the pace of industrialization and produce more and better industrial products to supply farmers. Workers and staff in national farm implement factories have already launched inter-factory competitions to support agricultural cooperativization, actively improving quality, vigorously reducing costs, increasing new varieties, and producing more affordable, multi-functional, durable, and new-style farm implements in a timely manner to support agricultural production. The broad masses of workers and staff are actively tapping the potential of enterprises from all aspects, continuing to improve the quality of production and consumer goods urgently needed by farmers, greatly increasing new varieties, and constantly reducing product costs. Workers and staff in all departments producing and supplying farmers with means of production and means of livelihood are responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao with such practical actions to meet the demands of the broad masses of farmers.

The ties between workers and staff and farmers in various parts of the country have been greatly strengthened in various aspects. Workers and staff in various places have adopted various forms to strengthen their ties with farmers, such as holding joint celebrations with farmers, visiting each other, donating books and pictorials, helping farmers establish libraries and clubs, teaching farmers how to use and repair new farm implements, teaching members of agricultural production cooperatives how to keep accounts, organizing film projection teams and amateur cultural troupes to help farmers carry out recreational activities, mobilizing family members and relatives living in rural areas to take the lead in joining cooperatives, encouraging them to provide the best seeds to the cooperatives for sowing during the autumn planting season, and investing their savings in the cooperatives as production funds, and so on. These activities are the workers' class's dissemination of communist ideas to the farmers. The broad masses of workers and staff are influencing farmers with the model behavior of the working class and inspiring the farmers' enthusiasm for labor to jointly build socialism.

II

Trade union organizations in all departments producing and supplying farmers with means of production and means of livelihood should organize and educate all workers and staff to work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and accelerate the pace of socialist industrial development to meet the growing material and cultural needs of farmers.

Running state-owned farms, livestock farms, machine tractor stations, agricultural technology extension stations, and agricultural technology experiment stations well is of great significance for conducting communist education among farmers. Therefore, trade unions must strengthen the work of these units and improve the operation and management of state-owned farms and livestock farms so that they can effectively play a demonstrative role for farmers. It is necessary to ensure that the yield per unit area of state-owned farms and the output of livestock products from state-owned livestock farms not only greatly exceed the production volume of individual farmers but also significantly exceed the production volume of agricultural production cooperatives and livestock production cooperatives; it is necessary to ensure that the cost of agricultural products from state-owned farms and the cost of livestock products from state-owned livestock farms is much lower than the cost of individual farmers, agricultural production cooperatives, and livestock production cooperatives. This can guide farmers to actively and widely participate in the agricultural cooperation movement and enable farmers to see their long-term prospects. The Plenary Session believes that the trade union federations of each province and autonomous region should actively assist the preparatory committee of the China Agricultural and Water Conservancy Trade Union to establish and improve the trade union organizations of all state-owned farms, livestock farms, machine tractor stations, agricultural technology extension stations, and agricultural technology experiment stations, strengthen their contact with and guidance to agricultural production cooperatives and livestock production cooperatives, and patiently disseminate various advanced cultivation methods, feeding methods, and improved varieties among agricultural production cooperatives, livestock production cooperatives, and the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen.

After the rapid development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the broad masses of farmers have urgently demanded that industrial departments supply a large number of high-quality and diverse industrial products, such as new-style farm implements, agricultural machinery, water conservancy machinery, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, pesticide machinery, and transportation tools, to meet the needs of agricultural production; at the same time, they also require learning the technology of using and repairing these machines. All relevant industrial trade unions and local trade union organizations must mobilize the masses, promote the socialist competition to a high tide, widely exchange advanced experience, and produce more and better industrial products for farmers in a timely manner; at the same time, they must also educate and organize workers and staff to actively help farmers repair farm implements, assemble parts, explain technologies, and improve their culture in their spare time to meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of farmers in production, life, technology, and culture.

At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen trade union work in commerce and transportation. Relevant industrial trade unions should mobilize all workers and staff to serve farmers with a high degree of labor enthusiasm and with a patient, amiable, proactive, and sincere attitude, and create convenient conditions for farmers in all work. Efforts should be made to simplify procedures to make farmers feel convenient, and all possible ways should be found to deliver industrial products suitable for farmers' needs and liked by farmers to the countryside in a timely manner.

Many regions have already realized or will soon realize the semi-socialist cooperation of agriculture, and advanced socialist agricultural cooperatives are emerging in large numbers. The rural landscape has presented a new look. All industrial, transportation, postal and telecommunications, commercial, banking, handicraft, cultural, educational, scientific, health, and other departments have close relationships with the agricultural cooperation movement and rural construction. Workers and staff in these departments should give play to their initiative and creativity, support farmers, and influence farmers with the model behavior of the working class in building socialism, and strive forward together for the construction of great socialism.

III

The Plenary Session believes that trade union organizations at all levels must formulate basic measures for trade union organizations to regularly help agricultural production cooperatives when comprehensively planning trade union work. These basic measures should include the following:

1.  Where conditions permit, trade union organizations in various factories and mines can establish regular contact with one or several agricultural production cooperatives through the local Party district committee. On the principle of not affecting production, organize technical workers to repair farm implements for farmers voluntarily in their spare time; send people to give farmers reports on the progress of socialist competitions in their units and on issues such as socialist industrialization; organize workers and staff to help farmers eliminate pests, birds, and animal damage. At the same time, they can also invite directors of agricultural production cooperatives and advanced producers to introduce the situation of agricultural cooperativization to the masses of workers and staff.
2.  Trade union organizations in various factories and mines should welcome members of agricultural production cooperatives to visit factories and organize workers and staff to visit agricultural production cooperatives.
3.  Organize and mobilize workers and staff to write letters to family members or relatives in rural areas to publicize the benefits of taking the path of cooperation and mobilize them to actively participate in the agricultural cooperation movement.
4.  Launch and organize workers and staff to hold worker-peasant joint celebrations during the Spring Festival, and establish regular communication relations with farmers through the Spring Festival joint celebration activities to exchange information and encourage production enthusiasm.
5.  Trade union organizations in factories and mines with conditions should organize amateur worker art troupes to regularly hold joint celebrations with farmers and help agricultural production cooperatives carry out amateur recreational activities.
6.  Provincial and municipal trade union film teams and grassroots trade union film teams show films to farmers on holidays (such as "October 1st," "May 1st," the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival).
7.  Mobilize workers and staff to donate popular books and pictorials to agricultural production cooperatives and help agricultural production cooperatives establish libraries and clubs.
8.  Trade union organizations in various factories and mines can consolidate the various contacts and guidance work for agricultural production cooperatives in the form of signing contact contracts.

It should be pointed out that an important prerequisite for doing the above work well is that trade union organizations at all levels must strengthen ideological education on the worker-peasant alliance for trade union workers and the masses of workers and staff. All trade union newspapers and periodicals must regularly publicize agricultural cooperativization so that the broad masses of workers and staff can understand the great significance of the worker-peasant alliance.

Trade union organizations at all levels must, in accordance with the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on the question of agricultural cooperativization, actively and systematically improve trade union work and support the agricultural cooperation movement. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, we will certainly be able to give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of workers and staff across the country, faithfully implement the Party's great program for the socialist transformation of agriculture, accelerate the pace of socialist industrial development, and make the worker-peasant alliance more consolidated on a new basis.

    关于动员职工支援农业合作化和农业生产的决议
    一
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和“中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议”的公布，促进了全国农村合作运动高潮的到来，也大大鼓舞了全国职工建设社会主义的劳动热情。同时农业合作化运动的高潮，要求全国职工加快工业化的速度，更快地生产更多、更好的工业品供应农民。全国农具厂职工已经开展了支援农业合作化的厂际竞赛，积极改善质量，大力降低成本，增加新品种，及时地生产更多的价廉物美、多式多样、坚固耐用的新式农具来支援农业增产。广大职工群众正在积极地从各方面挖掘企业的潜力，继续改善农民迫切需要的生产和生活用品的质量，大大增加新品种，不断降低产品成本。一切生产和供应农民生产资料和生活资料的部门的职工群众，都以这样的实际行动来响应党中央和毛主席的号召，满足广大农民的要求。
    全国各地职工群众同农民的联系在各个方面都已经大大加强起来。各地职工采取了各种形式来密切同农民的联系，如同农民举行联欢、互相访问、赠送书籍画报，帮助农民建立图书阅览室和俱乐部，教会农民使用和修理新农具，教会农业生产合作社社员记账，组织电影放映队、业余文工团帮助农民开展文娱活动，动员住在农村的家属和亲友带头入社，鼓励他们在秋种时拿出最好的种籽给合作社下种，把积蓄的钱投在社内作为生产资金等等。这些活动就是工人阶级对农民进行共产主义思想的传播。广大职工群众正在以工人阶级的模范行为影响农民，鼓舞农民的劳动热情，来共同建设社会主义。
    二
    所有生产和供应农民生产资料和生活资料的部门的工会组织，都应该组织和教育全体职工努力增产、厉行节约，提前完成第一个五年计划，加快社会主义工业发展的速度，来满足农民日益增长的物质生活和文化生活的需要。
    办好国营农场、畜牧场、机器拖拉机站、农业技术推广站和农业技术试验站，这对农民进行共产主义教育具有重要意义。所以工会必须加强这些单位的工作，改善国营农场、畜牧场的经营管理，使它们切实地对农民起示范作用。必须使国营农场的单位面积产量和国营畜牧场的畜产品产量，不但大大地超过个体农民的生产量，而且显著地超过农业生产合作社和畜牧生产合作社的生产量；必须使国营农场农产品和国营畜牧场畜产品的成本大大低于个体农民、农业生产合作社和畜牧生产合作社的成本，这就可以引导农民积极地、广泛地参加农业合作化运动，并且使农民看到自己远大的前景。全会认为各省、自治区工会联合会应当积极协助中国农业水利工会筹备委员会把所有的国营农场、畜牧场、机器拖拉机站、农业技术推广站和农业技术试验站的工会组织建立和健全起来，加强它们对农业生产合作社、畜牧生产合作社的联系和辅导工作，耐心地把各种先进耕种方法、饲养方法、优良品种在农业生产合作社、畜牧生产合作社以及广大农民、牧民中传播起来。
    在农业合作化运动迅速开展以后，广大农民已迫切要求工业部门供应大量的、质量好的、多种多样的工业品，如新式农具、农业机械、水利机械、化学肥料、农药、农药器械和运输工具等来适应农业增产的需要；同时要求学会使用和修理这些机械的技术。所有有关的产业工会和地方工会组织，必须发动群众，把社会主义竞赛推向高涨，广泛交流先进经验，及时地为农民生产更多、更好的各种工业品；同时还要教育和组织职工利用业余时间主动地帮助农民修理农具、装配零件、讲解技术、提高文化，以满足广大农民在生产上、生活上、技术上和文化上的迫切需要。
    同时，必须加强商业和交通运输业中的工会工作。有关的产业工会应当发动全体职工以高度的劳动热情，用耐心、和气、主动、诚恳的态度为农民服务，在一切工作中为农民创造便利条件。应当设法简化手续，使农民感到方便，并且应当想出一切办法把适合农民需要、为农民喜爱的工业品及时地送到农村中去。
    许多地区已经实现或者很快就要实现农业的半社会主义的合作化，而且社会主义的高级的农业合作社正在大量出现。农村面貌已经呈现一片新气象。所有工业、交通运输、邮电、商业、银行、手工业、文化、教育、科学、卫生等等部门，都同农业合作化运动和农村建设有着密切的关系。这些部门的职工应当发挥积极性和创造性，支援农民，并且以工人阶级建设社会主义的模范行为来影响农民，共同为建设伟大的社会主义而奋勇前进。
    三
    全会认为工会各级组织在全面规划工会工作时，必须订出关于工会组织经常帮助农业生产合作社的基本措施。这些基本措施应当包括下列各项：
    一、在条件许可的情况下，各厂矿的工会组织可以通过当地党的区委，同一个或几个农业生产合作社建立经常的联系。在不影响生产的原则下，组织技术工人利用业余时间，自愿地给农民修理农具；派人去给农民作关于本单位开展社会主义竞赛的情况及社会主义工业化等问题的报告；组织职工帮助农民消灭虫害、鸟害、兽害。同时，还可以邀请农业生产合作社主任、先进生产者给职工群众介绍农业合作化的情况。
    二、各厂矿的工会组织应当欢迎农业生产合作社社员参观工厂，并且组织职工访问农业生产合作社。
    三、组织、动员职工群众给在农村的家属或亲戚写信，宣传走合作化道路的好处，动员他们积极参加农业合作化运动。
    四、发动和组织职工群众在春节进行工农联欢，并且通过春节联欢活动，同农民建立经常的通信关系，以便互通情况，鼓舞生产热情。
    五、有条件的厂矿工会组织，应该组织工人业余文艺团体，经常同农民举行联欢会，并且帮助农业生产合作社开展业余文娱活动。
    六、省市工会电影队、基层工会电影队，每逢节日（如“十一”、“五一”、端午节、中秋节等）给农民放映电影。
    七、动员职工群众赠送通俗书籍、画报给农业生产合作社，并且帮助农业生产合作社建立图书阅览室和俱乐部。
    八、各厂矿的工会组织可以把对农业生产合作社的各项联系和辅导工作，用订立联系合同的形式巩固起来。
    应当指出，做好以上各项工作的一个重要前提，就是工会各级组织必须加强对工会工作者和职工群众的工农联盟的思想教育。所有的工会报纸、刊物必须经常地宣传农业合作化，使广大职工了解工农联盟的重大意义。
    工会各级组织，必须遵照党的七届六中全会关于农业合作化问题的决议，积极地、有计划地改进工会工作，支援农业合作化运动。我们坚信在党的领导下，一定能够发挥全国职工群众的积极性和主动性，忠实地执行党关于农业的社会主义改造的伟大纲领，加快社会主义工业的发展速度，使工农联盟在新的基础上更加巩固起来。
