    Workers at the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory
    Continuously Improve Production Efficiency

    Workers at the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory are continuously improving production efficiency in the socialist competition. The group in the foundry workshop making plowshares for double-wheel double-furrow plows has increased its daily production of plowshares from 550 to more than 700 since the 5th, and the scrap rate has also been greatly reduced. From the 1st to the 8th, workers in the machine shop created a total of 58 new production records. Planer operator Liu Zhiyi, processing parts for double-wheel double-furrow plows, increased the feed rate of the planer, etc., making his efficiency exceed the quota by about 100%.

    The factory's workers are guaranteeing to produce 15,000 double-wheel double-furrow plows and 1,000 seeders before the spring plowing season. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西安农业机械厂职工
    生产效率不断提高
    西安农业机械厂职工在社会主义竞赛中生产效率不断提高。铸工车间做双轮双铧犁犁镜的小组，自5日以来，由每天生产犁镜550个提高到700多个，废品率也大大降低。机工车间工人从1日到8日共创造了58个生产新纪录。刨工刘志义加工双轮双铧犁部件，加大了刨床的走刀量等，使效率超过了定额约一倍。
    这个厂的职工保证要在春耕前生产出15，000部双轮双铧犁和1，000部播种机。　（新华社）
