Xinhua News Agency, "Peace" Antarctic Observatory, 9th Dispatch from TASS: In the first week of February, the last month of the short Antarctic summer, the area where the Soviet Antarctic expedition landed experienced severe storms. Recently, blizzards and fierce winds have sprung up again, making the complex conditions for unloading ships even more difficult. Ships cannot directly approach the shore here. Large sections of snow cornices hanging on the ice layer are being eroded by the sea, with the danger of collapsing every minute.

The search for a suitable landing site continues tirelessly. Hydrographic surveyors are taking small boats to measure various sections of the coast, looking for passages between reefs and shoals. Measures are now being taken to get the cargo onto the mainland as much as possible, and plans are being drawn up to use floating bridges and build special docks.

When the wind subsided slightly, the steamship towed a barge loaded with bags of coal and other cargo towards a small place on the cliff, the only place where barges could dock. An automatic crane, close to the high ice bank edge, lifted the cargo from the barge onto a tractor-towed roller device.

All the builders of the "Peace" village have been living on the shore for several days, in the first batch of houses, which are not yet fully completed, but are already warm and in good condition. Small mobile generators are already generating electricity, and on clear days, lights can already be seen from the sea for the first time in the Soviet Antarctic scientific city.

    南极夏季里的苏联考察队
    新华社据塔斯社“和平”南极观测站9日讯　在南极短短的夏季的最后一个月——2月的第一周，苏联南极考察队登陆的地区有很厉害的风暴。最近，暴风雪和猛烈的狂风又起来了，因此船只卸货的复杂条件更加困难。船只在这里不能直接靠岸。挂在冰层上的大片雪檐被海水冲刷着，每分钟都有崩裂的危险。
    现在还在不倦地寻找靠岸地点。水文测量家乘小艇对沿岸各个地段进行测量，寻找暗礁和滩头之间的通路。现在正采取措施，尽量把货物送上大陆，还在制定种种利用浮桥和建造特殊码头的方案。
    在风稍微平息的时候，汽船就拖着装有一袋袋煤和其他一些货物的驳船靠向断崖的唯一可以靠驳船的一个小地方。紧靠在很高的冰岸边沿的自动起重机，就从驳船上把货物吊到拖拉机牵引的滚转装置上。
    “和平”村的全体建筑者在岸上已住了几天了，他们住在第一批、还没有完全建成的、但已很温暖和良好的房屋中。小型的活动发电机已在发电，晴天从海上已经可以看到南极苏联科学城中第一次出现的灯火。
