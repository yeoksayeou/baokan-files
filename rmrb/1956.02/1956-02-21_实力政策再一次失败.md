Title: The Policy of Strength Fails Again

The military exercises held simultaneously in Bangkok and Iwo Jima, after several days of clamor, have now come to an end.

The Bangkok exercise was called a "military exercise of the Manila Treaty Organization." However, the obvious fact is that the United States, under the guise of this military group, is flaunting its own armed forces. The most active in expressing interest in this exercise was the US government; the commander of this exercise was an American general; the main participants in this exercise were the American armed forces; the American news agencies enthusiastically promoted this exercise... A British person aptly described the Bangkok exercise as "99% an American show," which is a very appropriate and objective evaluation.

In this exercise, the United States mobilized its armed forces stationed as far away as Japan, the Philippines, and Okinawa, and trumpeted so-called "new weapons." During the exercise, American troops paraded ostentatiously and in force through the streets of the Thai capital. This American approach demonstrates the true purpose of the Bangkok exercise. Even the Associated Press frankly admitted that it "looked more like a demonstration of armed forces." The people of Asian countries now see more clearly that the American military provocations are aimed at all Southeast Asian countries, both within and outside the Manila Treaty Organization. This provocation also attempts to create a "brink of war" atmosphere, artificially intensifying the tense situation in Southeast Asia. This shows that the American aggressor bloc has not yet abandoned the illusion that by flaunting its military power, it can intimidate the Asian people, destroy the firm determination of Asian countries and people to maintain peace and oppose colonialism, maintain the increasingly disintegrating Manila Treaty Organization, and strengthen their control over the Asian countries in the Manila Treaty.

However, the American bet has obviously failed again. Today, the principles of peaceful coexistence and negotiated settlement of international disputes have become the common belief of the people of Asian countries. Under this situation, the American "policy of strength" will never find a way out. Pakistan wisely did not participate in this exercise. The criticism of the Bangkok exercise by Asian public opinion is also a good proof. The "Indian Times" wrote: "In the eyes of Asians, this kind of military exercise can only prove that Western powers cannot use any other method to deal with world affairs except military force." Even in Thailand, where the exercise was held, this military provocation was rightly opposed. The Thai newspaper "Universal Daily News" said in its editorial on the 10th that this sudden military exercise in Thailand was supposedly to prevent Thailand from turning to a neutral policy. The editorial said that their purpose is to seek benefits in Thailand, and even more so to control Thailand under their power, not allowing it to have its own opinions or implement policies that are beneficial to Thailand itself. Bangkok's "Ping Thai Daily" pointed out even more sharply: Only the United States needs the Manila Treaty Organization's exercises because it intends to once again display its armed forces to support its policies in this region. This righteous indignation of Thai public opinion has received the sympathy and support of all progressive mankind.

Similarly, the Bangkok exercise also failed to achieve the goal of stabilizing the Manila Treaty Organization. The main motivation for the United States to piece together this military bloc is to use this method to pull its Western allies to pull chestnuts out of the fire for it in Southeast Asia, and to establish and consolidate the rule of American monopoly capital over Southeast Asia. On such a basis, it is impossible to imagine that contradictions and struggles will not occur within this organization. The lukewarm attitude of the Western member states of the Manila Treaty towards this exercise, and the non-participation of some countries, have greatly disappointed the American newspapers that had previously publicized the "solid link exercise." The New York "Times" admitted that within the Manila Treaty Organization, "the current atmosphere is not a manifestation of unity, but is full of complaints and rejections."

Even within the American ruling group, this exercise has been criticized by some more sober public opinion. The "Washington Post" believes that this exercise is "a bit like an unnecessary provocation." It accused this exercise of "radiating an atmosphere of heating up the Cold War."

The result of the Bangkok exercise is completely contrary to the original hopes of the American aggressors. The "demonstration" of the "policy of strength" has become another failure of the "policy of strength." However, the American aggressors have not learned a lesson from this event. There are reports that the United States is also planning to conduct exercises in the Taiwan region, attempting to intimidate the Chinese people, whom it has never been able to intimidate. The United States is also preparing to hand over all the weapons used in the Manila Treaty exercise to the Manila Treaty Organization's "weapons co-storage organization," expand "military assistance" to Southeast Asian countries, and install "teeth" on the Manila Treaty Organization.

Donkeys often abandon impassable roads after being beaten. The intelligence of the American aggressive forces seems to be a little worse than that of donkeys. It stubbornly refuses to abandon the bankrupt policy of intimidation and the new colonial rule of using military blocs to control other countries. However, the situation in Asia today shows that no force can prevent the independent development of emerging countries such as the People's Republic of China and India, and no form can disguise colonialism and make Asian countries and people willingly accept its enslavement. The American approach can only arouse greater opposition from the Asian people, and foreshadow greater failures for the "policy of strength" and colonialism.

### 实力政策再一次失败

    实力政策再一次失败
    在曼谷和硫黄岛同时举行的军事演习，接连喧嚷了几天之后，现在已经收场了。
    曼谷演习被叫做“马尼拉条约组织的军事演习”。然而，明摆着的事实是：美国假借了这个军事集团的名义，来炫耀它自己的武装力量。对这次演习表示最积极的是美国政府；指挥这次演习的是美国将军；参加这次演习的主要人员是美国的武装部队；为这次演习热心捧场的是美国的通讯社……。一个英国人士把曼谷演习称为“99％的美国的表演”，这是十分恰当的客观评价。
    美国在这次演习中动员了它远在日本、菲律宾和冲绳等地的武装部队，并且大吹大擂地宣传了所谓“新式武器”。在演习中，美国军队在泰国首都的街道上耀武扬威，大举游行。美国的这种做法，说明了曼谷演习的真正目的。甚至连美联社也直率地承认：这“看上去更像一种武装部队的示威”。亚洲各国人民现在已经更加清楚地看到：美国的军事挑衅，是针对着马尼拉条约组织以内和以外的所有东南亚国家的。这种挑衅，也企图制造出一种“战争边缘”的气氛，人为地加剧东南亚的紧张局势。这就说明：美国侵略集团至今还没有放弃这样一种幻想：运用炫耀武力的方法，可以吓倒亚洲人民，可以摧毁亚洲国家和人民维护和平和反对殖民主义的坚定决心，可以维系日益涣散的马尼拉条约组织，可以加强他们对马尼拉条约中的亚洲国家的控制。
    但是，美国的赌注显然又押空了。今天，和平共处和协商解决国际争端的原则，已成为亚洲各国人民的共同信念。在这种情势下，美国的“实力政策”是永远不会找到出路的。巴基斯坦明智地没有参加这次演习。亚洲各国舆论对这次曼谷演习的抨击，也是一个很好的证明。“印度时报”写道：“在亚洲人看来，这种军事演习只能证明西方大国除了使用军事力量以外再不能用别的方法处理世界事务了。”即使在演习所在地的泰国，这种军事挑衅也理所当然地受到反对。泰国“永恒报”在10日的社论中说，这次突然在泰国举行作战演习，据说是为了使泰国不致转而采取中立政策。社论说，它们的目的是要在泰国谋取利益，更甚的是要把泰国控制在它们的权力之下，不许有自己的见地或施行有利于泰国本身的政策。曼谷的“屏泰报”更尖锐地指出：只有美国，才需要马尼拉条约组织的演习；因为它打算再一次显示它的武装力量，来支持它在这个地区的政策。泰国舆论这种正义的愤慨，得到了一切进步人类的同情和支持。
    同样地，曼谷演习也并没有达到稳定马尼拉条约组织的目的。因为美国拼凑这个军事集团的主要动机，是通过这种方式拉着它的西方盟友为它在东南亚火中取栗，建立并巩固美国垄断资本对东南亚的统治。在这样一个基础上，不可能设想这个组织的内部能不发生矛盾和斗争。马尼拉条约西方成员国对这次演习表现冷淡，有的国家甚至不参加，这已经使得事先大肆宣传“坚固环节的演习”的美国报纸，大为泄气了。纽约的“时代”杂志承认：在马尼拉条约组织内部，“现在的气氛并不是团结的表现，而是充满了抱怨和拒绝。”
    甚至在美国统治集团内部这次演习也受到一些比较清醒的舆论的斥责。“华盛顿邮报”认为这个演习“有点像不必要的挑衅”。它指责这种演习“散发出了热化冷战的气氛”。
    曼谷演习的结果，和美国侵略者原来的希望恰恰完全相反。“实力政策”的“示威”，变成了“实力政策”的又一次失败。但是，美国侵略者还没有从这一事件中吸取教训。有消息说，美国还正在策划在台湾地区进行演习，企图恐吓它从来也吓不倒的中国人民。美国还准备把马尼拉条约演习中使用的全部武器交给马尼拉条约组织的“武器共储组织”，扩大对东南亚国家的“军事援助”，为马尼拉条约组织装上“牙齿”。
    驴子在挨了打之后，常常是会抛弃走不通的道路的。美国侵略势力的智力看来比驴子还差一点。它硬是不肯抛弃那种早已破产的恐吓政策和利用军事集团来控制其他国家的新的殖民统治形式。然而，亚洲今天的局势表明：没有任何力量可以阻止中华人民共和国和印度等新兴国家的独立发展，没有一种形式可以把殖民主义伪装起来而使亚洲国家和人民甘心接受它的奴役。美国的做法，只能引起亚洲人民更大的反对，为“实力政策”和殖民主义预伏着更大的失败。
