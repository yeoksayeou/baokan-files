Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 5th: The "Indian Express" on February 4th quoted a telegram from Washington by the Indian Press Trust on February 3rd, saying that the Indian government has denied that it knew in the past that the United States had intended to use atomic weapons if the Korean War had continued.

The Indian government has expressed its surprise to the State Department about the remarks allegedly made by Dulles in an article in "Life" magazine, which reportedly said that this warning had been hinted to China through Prime Minister Nehru.

The Indian Press Trust's telegram said that India's ambassador to Washington, Mehta, is believed to have told the State Department on February 2nd that no such hint had ever been made to Nehru, and therefore the Indian government had not mentioned this matter to China under any circumstances.

    印度政府否认曾知道美国打算在朝鲜战争中使用原子武器
    新华社新德里5日电　“印度快报”2月4日引证印度报业托辣斯2月3日从华盛顿发回的电讯说，印度政府已经否认它过去知道美国曾经打算使用原子武器，假如朝鲜战争继续下去的话。
    印度政府已经就“生活”杂志的一篇文章中所载据说杜勒斯说过的话向国务院表示它感到惊奇，据说杜勒斯说，这个警告曾通过尼赫鲁总理向中国暗示。
    印度报业托辣斯的电讯说，据信印度驻华盛顿大使梅达2月2日向国务院说，从没有向尼赫鲁作过这样的暗示，因此在任何情形下印度政府也没有把这种事向中国提起过。
