Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

    I am an engineering technician and a paper-making scientist. I am very excited and honored to participate in this CPPCC meeting. This meeting added more than 100 new members, and more than 600 people from all walks of life attended as observers. This situation, on the one hand, as Premier Zhou said: my country's people's democratic united front is broader and stronger than before; on the other hand, it also shows that the Communist Party and the People's Government have further promoted their democratic work style.

    I was greatly educated and encouraged by the reports of Premier Zhou and the responsible comrades of the conference, and I fully support them. I am prepared to actively work hard and implement the relevant tasks mentioned in the report in my own work post. Today I would like to provide some suggestions on the issue of "We must mobilize all the power of intellectuals to catch up with the world's advanced scientific and cultural level in a not-too-long period of time":

    This task is necessary and possible. "After the principles and policies are determined, cadres determine everything." Therefore, I think we should think of ways in many aspects to accelerate the training of senior intellectuals. If it is said that "at least 1 million senior intellectuals should be trained in the next 12 years," and we currently only have more than 100,000 senior intellectuals (including lecturers), what should we do? It is a good method to adopt a method of one teacher matching several apprentices, so that a dedicated responsibility system can be used, and it is also convenient to assess the teaching effect. However, after all, there are still very few senior intellectuals in our country, especially famous teachers, and the distribution of senior intellectuals in various scientific departments is also extremely uneven. At the same time, senior intellectuals themselves have very tight work tasks in various different positions, and the teaching time after work is also limited. Therefore, on the basis of the method of apprenticeship, we must also consider supplementing with auxiliary methods that save manpower and achieve practical results. If "audio recording is used instead of oral teaching, and slides are used instead of blackboards" in the teaching process, it can not only overcome the difficulty of insufficient time for famous teachers, but also achieve a wider range of effects. Recording and slides are not new things in the education field, but they have not been widely valued, especially as a means of improving the labor efficiency of teaching. It is still rare in our country for a famous teacher, famous scientist, or famous engineer to systematically use them in teaching methods. This method has the following advantages.

    1. It can save the teaching time of famous teachers - the general or basic teaching content in the textbooks can be used for recording and slides, so as to avoid repetition year after year and class after class, wasting time. If the basic content of teaching is not changed, these recordings and slides can be used for a long period of time. In this way, famous teachers only need to use less time to orally teach some supplementary content for answering difficult questions or orally teach new scientific achievements discovered after recording.

    2. It can expand the teaching objects - it is basic for a teacher to take several apprentices, but other students who listen to recorded lectures can also be regarded as indirect apprentices of famous teachers. The indirect teachers of these students can be workers, farmers, or senior apprentices or general scientific engineering technicians who do practical work. However, these small teachers must also stipulate a dedicated responsibility system under the teaching plan of famous teachers, and they must also assess teaching results. If the results learned in this way pass the examination and are either associate doctors or doctors, they should be given appropriate degrees. The students brought out in this way have received the theoretical guidance of famous teachers and the guidance of personnel with rich practical experience. If students are willing to study hard, the teaching effect will not be bad. Doing so may also promote collaboration and contact between scientific research institutions and engineering technology departments.

    3. It can facilitate teaching guidance - it is generally difficult to ask famous teachers to give students regular tutoring work. If there is the assistance of recordings and slides, tutors can also conduct self-study at any time by using the recordings and slides of famous teachers and other teaching materials, combined with practice, without being restricted by the lack of time for famous teachers. Tutors can help apprentices and conduct tutoring work through recordings and slides.

    4. It can ensure that teaching time is not interrupted due to the lack of time for famous teachers or accidental accidents - recently I listened to the famous storyteller Lian Kuoru's storytelling of the Romance of Qin and Han. One day, the radio station reported that Comrade Lian Kuoru had stopped broadcasting due to illness. It was changed to a recording broadcast of Lian Kuoru's Water Margin. The audience was waiting for the next episode of the Romance of Qin and Han, and they were naturally a little disappointed when it suddenly stopped halfway. I think that students who listen to lectures by famous teachers also do not want the teacher to interrupt teaching due to some reason. However, we do not have many famous teachers, and each one is indispensable. Their work must be very busy. In addition to necessary political activities, they may not be able to attend class on a certain day due to some reason, or they may encounter a few days of sick leave, which will hinder the teaching progress. Supplementary teaching can be more flexible in terms of time. If basic teaching is interrupted, it will be difficult to continue talking below. This will not only inevitably make people feel disappointed like listening to Comrade Lian Kuoru's storytelling, but also affect the country's plan for training senior intellectuals to some extent.

    The above immature opinions, if they are helpful to raising my country's scientific and cultural level to the world's advanced scientific and cultural level in a relatively short period of time, I hope that the relevant government departments will consider them and start planning and organizing to promote them. At the same time, I also hope that friends and comrades from all walks of life can consider more specific methods on how to improve my country's scientific and cultural level in a shorter period of time, in order to respond to the call to implement the great and glorious task proposed by Premier Zhou. As long as everyone thinks of ways and works together, I believe that this "extremely glorious and great cause that no one has ever done before" will definitely proceed more smoothly and more quickly.

    I personally guarantee: I will work hard to study the theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, overcome shortcomings, improve the theoretical level of science and technology, and strive to be a red engineering technology expert.

    于滋潭的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志们：
    我是一个工程技术人员，造纸科学工作者。这次能参加政协会议，我感到非常兴奋和光荣。这次会议增加了100多位新委员，同时还有600多位各界人士列席。这种情况，一方面正如周总理所说的：我国的人民民主统一战线比以前更加广泛，更加强大了；另一方面也说明共产党和人民政府的民主作风也有了更进一步的发扬。
    周总理和大会各位负责同志的报告给我很大的教育和鼓舞，我完全拥护。报告中所提今后的有关任务，我准备在自己工作岗位上积极努力贯彻执行。今天我想就
  “我们必须动员知识分子的一切力量，在不太长的时间内赶上世界的先进的科学文化水平”的问题提供一点参考意见：
    这项任务是必须的，同时也是可能的。“方针政策决定以后，干部决定一切”，因此我以为我们应当从多方面想办法，加速进行高级知识分子的培养工作。如果说“今后12年内至少要培养出100多万高级知识分子”，而我们目前高级知识分子（包括讲师）又仅只有10万多，怎么办？采用一个老师配几个徒弟的办法是好的，这样可以运用专责制，也便于考核教学效果。但毕竟我国目前高级知识分子尤其是名师还很少，高级知识分子在各个科学部门的分布也极不平衡，同时高级知识分子本身在各个不同岗位上的工作任务也都很紧张，工余的教学时间毕竟也是有限的。因此，在带徒弟的方法基础上，还须考虑辅以既省人力、又收实效的辅助办法。假如在教学过程中部分地采取“录音代口授，幻灯代黑板”，不仅可以克服名师时间不足的困难，并可收到较为广泛的效果。录音、幻灯用之于教育界本不是什么新鲜事，只是还不曾被广泛重视，特别是作为提高教学的劳动效率，作为一个名师、名科学家、名工程师有系统地运用在教学方法上在我国还是不多见的。这个办法，有下面几点好处。
    一、可以节省名师教学时间——教材中的一般性或基本性的教学内容都可以运用录音和幻灯，免得年年、班班重复，浪费时间。在教学基本内容不变更的情况下，这些录音和幻灯是可以在较长的时期内加以利用的。这样，名师只须利用较少的时间口授一些疑难解答的补充内容或口授在录音以后所发现的科学新成就。
    二、可以扩大教学对象——一个老师带几个徒弟这是基本的，但其他听录音授课的学生也还可以作为名师的间接徒弟。这些学生的间接老师可以是工人，可以是农民，也可以是大徒弟或一般的做实际工作的科学工程技术人员。但是这些小老师也必须在名师的教学计划之下规定专责制度，也要考核教学成绩。如果这样学出来的成绩经过考试及格是副博士也好，博士也好，都应当给以适当的学位。这样带出来的学生，既得到了名师的理论指导，也得到了实践经验丰富的人员的指导。如果学生肯于认真学习，教学效果是不会坏的。这样做也许还可以促进科学研究机关和工程技术部门的协作和联系。
    三、可以便于进行教学辅导——要求名师经常给学生们做辅导工作，一般是比较困难的。如果有了录音和幻灯的辅助，那么辅导人员也可以通过手边名师的录音和幻灯片等教材，结合实际随时进行自我研究，不至于受到名师时间不足的限制。辅导人员可以通过录音和幻灯来帮助徒弟，进行辅导工作。
    四、可以保证教学时间不因名师时间不足或偶然发生事故而中断——最近我听名说书家连阔如同志讲秦汉演义。有一天广播电台报告连阔如同志因病停止播讲。改成连阔如同志水浒传的录音广播。听众正在等待秦汉演义的下回分解，忽然中途停止当然有些失望。我想，听名师讲课的学生也是不希望老师因故中断教学的。但是我们的名师不多，有一个顶一个，他的工作必定非常繁忙，加上必要的政治活动，说不定那天因故不能上课，或者也会碰上因病停课几天，这就妨碍了教学进程。补充性的教学，在时间上可以比较灵活些，如果基本性的教学一中断，下面就不好接下去讲。这不仅同听连阔如同志说书一样必然会令人感到失望，而且多少也影响了国家对高级知识分子的培养计划。
    以上的一点不成熟意见，如果是有益于在较短时期内把我国的科学文化水平提高到世界的先进的科学文化水平的话，希望政府有关部门加以考虑并着手筹划和组织推动起来。同时还希望各界朋友们和同志们，能就如何在较短时间内提高我国科学文化水平问题，多考虑一些具体办法，以响应贯彻周总理所提的这一伟大光荣任务的号召。只要大家想办法，大家齐心努力，我相信，这“前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”，是一定会进行得更加顺利更加迅速的。
    我个人保证：努力学习马克思列宁主义的理论知识，克服缺点，提高科学技术理论水平，争取做一个红色的工程技术专家。
