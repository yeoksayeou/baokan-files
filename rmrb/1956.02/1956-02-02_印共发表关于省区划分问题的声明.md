Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th - The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of India (CPI) issued a statement to the press on January 24 regarding the issue of redrawing provincial boundaries.

The statement said that the events that have occurred in several regions since the government's decision on January 16 to reorganize the states and the provocative arrests in Bombay before the decision was made have caused serious damage to India and its prestige. Many people have been shot dead by police bullets, and many more have been injured. A large amount of property has been destroyed. In many states, people are stirring up chauvinistic sentiments and arousing anger. Anti-social elements are taking advantage of this situation to carry out violence and destruction at will.

The statement continued that the Communist Party strongly condemns the divisive activities carried out by these anti-social elements and their unbridled acts of intimidation against minorities, robbery of shops, and destruction of public property; and calls on all patriotic forces to recognize that such behavior cannot strengthen the democratic movement advocating the division of states on a linguistic basis, but will instead weaken it.

The statement believes that the main responsibility for these unfortunate events lies with the Indian government. The statement said that although the Indian government agreed to the demand for the reorganization of states under the pressure of the people, it refused to adhere to any positive principles. This action has encouraged divisive, chauvinistic, and anti-social elements, and weakened the position of those who advocate a fair and democratic solution to this problem.

The statement expressed opposition to the suggestion of merging West Bengal and Bihar, saying that forcing two nations that speak different languages into one province not only means ignoring the demand for linguistic provinces but will also exacerbate hatred and perpetuate animosity.

The statement said that the Communist Party of India demands that the principle of linguistic provinces be adhered to and that these principles be implemented based on the recommendations made by the Communist Party in its memorandum to the States Reorganisation Commission. These recommendations advocate that provinces should be redivided on a linguistic basis, and that when dividing the boundaries, the village should be the unit. If the majority of the people in a village speak the same language and the village is adjacent to a province that speaks this language, then the village should be assigned to that province. This is the only fair and democratic solution to the boundary problem, and this solution should be firmly adopted in all regions.

According to Indian newspapers, after the Indian government announced its decision on the issue of provincial division on January 16, riots occurred in some parts of India. The Maharashtrians in Bombay Province opposed the decision to designate Bombay City as a centrally administered territory. They demanded that Bombay City be assigned to Maharashtra State and serve as the state capital. Protest demonstrations regarding boundary divisions were held in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and Madras provinces. Violence and acts of destruction also occurred in these places.

    印共发表关于省区划分问题的声明
    新华社新德里30日电　印度共产党政治局在1月24日向报界发表了关于重新划分省区问题的声明。
    声明说，自从政府在1月16日决定改组各省邦以来在好几个地区所发生的事件和孟买在作出决定以前所进行的挑衅性逮捕给印度和它的威信造成了严重的损害。许多人被警察的子弹打死了，还有许多人被打伤了，大量财产被破坏了。许多省邦都有人在煽起沙文主义情绪，激起忿怒的情绪。反社会分子正在利用这种情况肆意施行暴力和破坏。
    声明接着说，共产党强烈谴责这些反社会分子所进行的分裂活动和他们肆意进行的恫吓少数民族的行为和抢劫商店、破坏公共财产等无赖行为；并且呼吁一切爱国力量认清这种行为不能加强主张按语言分邦的民主运动，相反却会削弱这一运动。
    声明认为，这些不幸事件的主要责任在于印度政府。声明说，印度政府虽然在人民的压力下同意了改组各省邦的要求，但是它又拒绝坚持任何肯定的原则。这种行动鼓励了分裂的、沙文主义的和反社会的分子，削弱了主张公正和民主地解决这个问题的那些人的地位。
    声明表示反对关于西孟加拉省和比哈尔省合并的建议说，把两个说不同语言的民族硬并在一个省中的做法不但意味着无视按语言划省的要求，而且将会使仇恨加剧，使彼此的敌意一直存在下去。
    声明说，印度共产党要求遵守按语言划省的原则，并且根据共产党在给省区划分委员会的备忘录中提出的建议来实现这些原则。这些建议主张，省区应当在语言的基础上重新划分，在划分界线时应当以村为单位，凡是一个村中的大多数人民说同一语言，而这个村又同说这种语言的省相邻时，这个村就应当划归那个省。这是界线问题的唯一公平和民主的解决办法，在一切地区都应当坚决采用这个解决办法。
    据印度报纸报道，在1月16日印度政府宣布关于省区划分问题的决定以后，印度一些地方发生了骚动。孟买省的马哈拉施特拉人反对把孟买市划为中央直辖市的决定，他们要求把孟买市划归马哈拉施特拉邦，并且作为这个邦的首府。在西孟加拉、比哈尔、奥里萨和马德拉斯等省举行了关于边界划分问题的抗议示威。这些地方还发生了暴力和破坏事件。
