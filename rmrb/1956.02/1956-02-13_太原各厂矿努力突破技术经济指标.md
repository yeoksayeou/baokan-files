Taiyuan factories and mines are witnessing the emergence of a mass movement to break through originally planned technical and economic indicators.

Since the Taiyuan City held a conference of activists from factories and mines in late January, many factory and mine workers have put forward the slogan of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and have begun to promote various advanced experiences in a comprehensive and systematic manner. New records are constantly emerging. Workers in the papermaking workshop of the Taiyuan Paper Mill originally produced first-class products accounting for only about 20% of the products. On January 28, they set a record of over 70% first-class products. Huang Dingguo, a steel casting worker at the Shanxi Machine Factory, organized a shock team to solve the problem of clearing burrs, completing three days' worth of work in one day. Workers are not satisfied with creating various new records, but demand to universally achieve advanced levels. In order to realize the guarantee of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule on National Day this year, the employees of Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory launched a "one and a half quota" movement, that is, all workers complete 12 hours of work in 8 hours.

Currently, whether on construction sites, in mines, or in factory workshops, people are unwilling to lag behind in the struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. At the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, doctors proposed to break with conventions, go deep into workshops and dormitories to improve medical and health work, and promote the improvement of attendance rates and labor productivity; cooks proposed to deliver hot meals to the factories to ensure that workers who cannot leave production can eat well and produce well.

### 太原各厂矿努力突破技术经济指标

    太原各厂矿努力突破技术经济指标
    突破原订技术经济指标，正在太原市厂矿企业中形成一个群众运动。
    太原市在1月下旬召开了厂矿企业积极分子大会以后，许多厂矿职工都提出了提早完成五年计划的口号，开始全面、系统地推广各种先进经验，新纪录随着不断出现。太原造纸厂造纸车间工人原来生产的一等品只占产品20％左右，1月28日创造一等品达70％以上的纪录。山西机器厂铸钢工人黄定国组织突击队解决了清铲毛刺的问题，作到一天完成3天的工作量。工人们不满足于创造各种新纪录，而要求普遍达到先进水平。太原矿山机器厂职工为了实现提前在今年国庆节完成五年计划的保证，开展了“个半定额”运动，即作到全体工人8小时完成12小时的工作量。
    目前，无论在工地、矿井或工厂的车间，人们都不愿在提早完成五年计划的斗争中落后。在太原钢铁厂，医师们提出要打破常规，深入车间宿舍去搞好医疗卫生工作，促进出勤率和劳动生产率的提高；炊事员们提出要把热饭送到工场，保证离不开生产的工人能够吃好生产好。
