Yunnan has nearly 30,000 members of minority nationalities in the Party
    In Yunnan Province, 28,753 people from various minority nationalities have joined the Chinese Communist Party.
    Since the establishment of basic-level Party organizations in the latter half of 1952, basic-level Party organizations at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party in Yunnan Province have successively established basic-level Party organizations and developed a number of Party members among the Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Yi, Minjia, Naxi, Dai, Nong, Lisu, Hani, Zhuang, Kawa, Jingpo and other minority nationalities. Those who were admitted to the Party were outstanding sons and daughters of minority nationalities who had been tempered through a long period of class struggle and production struggle. Before joining the Party, they all systematically studied communism, basic knowledge of the Communist Party, and ethnic policies.

    云南少数民族已有近3万人入党
    云南省各少数民族中已有28，753人加入了中国共产党。
    云南省中共各级党的基层组织，自1952年下半年建党以来，先后分别在回、藏、苗、彝、民家、纳西、傣、侬、傈僳、哈尼、僮、佧瓦、景颇等少数民族中建立了党的基层组织，发展了一批党员。被接收入党的都是经过较长时期的阶级斗争和生产斗争锻炼出来的少数民族中的优秀儿女。他们在入党以前又都比较有系统地学习了共产主义和共产党基本知识以及民族政策。　　（本报驻昆明记者）
