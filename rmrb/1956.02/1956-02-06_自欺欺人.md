    Self-Deception
    On December 13th of last year, the Wuhan Municipal Finance Bureau bought 50 Chinese typewriters from the Municipal Cultural Goods Company and specified that they would pick them up in two days. The manager of the Municipal Department Store and the director of the Central Sales Department learned of this news. Upon hearing that it was a large transaction worth over 60,000 yuan, they immediately called the Cultural Goods Company, saying, "The Central Sales Department hasn't been performing well in completing its tasks, and we hope you can support us by letting the Central Sales Department handle this transaction..." The director of the Central Sales Department even went to the Cultural Goods Company in person to meet with the manager and request strong support. The Cultural Goods Company manager thought, "Two companies completing their tasks with one transaction is truly killing two birds with one stone," and decided to let the Central Sales Department handle the transaction, selling the typewriters to the Department Store, which would then be sold by the Department Store's Central Sales Department to the Municipal Finance Bureau. Afterwards, the Municipal Department Store even praised the stationery counter of the Central Sales Department in its daily work report for the "battle achievements" of completing the sales task half a month ahead of schedule.
    May we ask the Wuhan Municipal Department Store, is this called "fulfilling the state plan"? This is merely using self-deception to deceive the state!

    自欺欺人
    去年12月13日，武汉市财政局在市文化用品公司买妥了50部中文打字机，讲明隔一天取货。这个消息被市百货公司经理和中心门市部主任知道了。他们一听是6万多元的一笔大交易，马上给文化用品公司去电话说：“中心门市部任务完成得不好，希望支持一下，把这笔交易让给中心门市部……”中心门市部的主任更亲自赶到文化用品公司找经理面谈，请求大力支持。文化用品公司经理觉得：“一笔生意两个公司完成任务，真是一举两得，”便决定把这笔交易让给中心门市部，把这批打字机售给百货公司，再由百货公司中心门市部售给市财政局。事后，市百货公司还在工作日报里表扬了中心门市部文具柜提早半个月完成销售任务的“战果”。
    请问武汉市百货公司，这叫做“完成国家计划”吗？这不过是用自欺欺人的办法来欺骗国家罢了！
