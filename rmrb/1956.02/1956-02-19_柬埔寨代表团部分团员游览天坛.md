Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: A portion of the Cambodian Royal National Delegation toured the Temple of Heaven today.

The distinguished guests first viewed the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests. Then, passing through the glazed tile gate tower, they arrived at the Imperial Vault of Heaven, where the guests showed great interest in this exquisitely structured building. The distinguished guests also experimented with the Three Echo Stones, the Echo Wall, and the Circular Mound Altar in front of the Imperial Vault of Heaven, and were delighted when they heard the crisp echoes.

Before visiting the Temple of Heaven, the distinguished guests went to Shichahai to watch ice skating.

    柬埔寨代表团部分团员游览天坛
    据新华社18日讯　柬埔寨王国国家代表团一部分团员，今天到天坛游览。
    贵宾们先观看了祈年殿。然后，通过琉璃门楼，到了皇穹宇，贵宾们对这个结构精巧的建筑很感兴趣。贵宾们还在皇穹宇前面的三音石、回音壁和圜丘作了试验，当他们听到清脆的回声的时候，都很高兴。
    在到天坛游览以前，贵宾们曾到什刹海看了溜冰。
