    Guangzhou's Flower Market
    Jiang Cheng
    When the area north of the Five Ridges is still covered in ice and snow, Guangzhou is already a spring of blooming flowers. Before the Spring Festival, Guangzhou held its annual grand flower market. There are many flower farmers and gardeners in the southern suburbs of Guangzhou who have been planting flowers for generations, putting in much effort to welcome the flower market each year. Many farmers from nearby counties around Guangzhou also transport the various flowers they grow to the flower market.
    The flower market is truly a vibrant ocean of flowers. There, you can find bright and beautiful peach blossoms, plum blossoms, Chinese New Year flowers, gladiolus, roses, and cockscomb flowers, as well as elegant narcissus and rare jade tree coral and phoenix ball flowers. On Jianglan Road, Anti-Japanese Road, and Guangfu Road, in the city center, potted plants and flowers arranged in water tanks create a high and low flower forest.
    Before this year's Spring Festival, the weather in Guangzhou was warmer than last year, and many flowers bloomed earlier. At night, bright lights illuminate the flower market, making it extraordinarily beautiful. Citizens flock in like a tide, selecting and admiring their favorite flowers until late at night.

    广州的花市
    江城
    当五岭以北还是一片冰雪的时候，广州已经是百花齐放的春天。春节前夕，广州市举行了一年一度的盛大的花市。广州市南郊有许多世世代代种花的花农和花匠，每年他们都用许多心血栽植鲜花，来迎接花市。广州附近许多县份也有不少农民把自己栽的各种花运到花市来。
    花市上真是一片万紫千红的花的海洋。在那里，有艳丽的桃花、梅花、吊钟、剑兰、玫瑰和鸡冠花，也有淡雅的水仙和稀有的玉树珊瑚、凤凰球等各种鲜花。在浆栏路、抗日路和光复路一带市中心的大街上，花盆里栽的，水缸里插的，高高低低，一片花林。
    今年春节以前，广州市的天气比去年温暖，许多花都提早开放。入夜，明亮的灯光把花市映照得分外美丽。市民们像潮水一样涌来，挑选和欣赏心爱的花卉，直到深夜。
