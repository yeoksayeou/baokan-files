Jiangsu Province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. As of January 29th, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives in the province has reached over 7.3 million, accounting for 84% of the province's total peasant households. There are also more than 10,000 advanced agricultural production cooperatives that have been established or are being established throughout the province. In the Yancheng and Xuzhou special districts, and the suburbs of Nanjing, Xuzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other nine provincial-level cities, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has reached over 90% of the total number of peasant households.

With the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, a winter production upsurge has been launched in rural areas throughout the province. By January 25th, the province had overfulfilled its winter farmland water conservancy construction tasks, with a workload four and a half times greater than the entire year of 1954, benefiting 7.2 million mu of farmland. Winter fallow fields throughout the province have generally undergone winter plowing, and paddy fields have generally been plowed twice. Great achievements have also been made in fertilizer accumulation and afforestation. Currently, representatives of high-yield model cooperatives throughout the province are meeting, and a large-scale production increase movement of "1,000 jin of grain and 100 jin of cotton" is about to unfold in rural areas throughout the province.

    江苏基本实现半社会主义农业合作化
    江苏省已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。到1月29日止，全省入社农户已经达730多万户，占全省总农户的84％。全省已经建成和正在建立的高级农业生产合作社也有1万多个。盐城、徐州两专区和南京、徐州、无锡、苏州等9个省辖市的郊区，入社农户都已经达到农户总数的90％以上。
    随着农业合作化运动的发展，全省农村掀起了冬季生产的热潮。到1月25日，全省已经超额完成了冬季兴修农田水利任务，工程量比1954年全年工程量还大四倍半，受益农田达720万亩。全省冬闲田普遍进行了冬耕，水田还普遍耕过两遍。积肥、造林等方面也取得了很大的成绩。目前，全省高额丰产社的代表正在开会，一个大规模的“千斤粮、百斤棉”的增产运动即将在全省农村展开。（本报驻南京记者）
