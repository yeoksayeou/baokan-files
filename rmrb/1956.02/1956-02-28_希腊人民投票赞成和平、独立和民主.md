    The Greek People Vote for Peace, Independence, and Democracy
    Hu Shisheng
    Greece held parliamentary elections on February 19. The "Democratic Union," which advocates safeguarding Greek national interests, firmly defending the right of self-determination for Cyprus, and pursuing an independent policy, won the majority of votes—over 1.76 million. The ruling group's "National Radical Union" only received over 1.58 million votes. This is a significant change in the balance of political forces in Greece. This change vividly demonstrates that the policy of following the United States, participating in military blocs, and expanding armaments and preparing for war has been rejected by the people in Greece; and the call for pursuing an independent and autonomous policy is growing stronger.

    No wonder the American bourgeois newspapers are greatly disturbed, considering the results of the Greek election to be "disappointing" and "a very unpleasant situation." This sentiment is entirely understandable. Because the result of this election is a powerful blow to the "strength policy" pursued by the United States in Greece and a failure of the aggressive foreign policy of the United States.

    This Greek parliamentary election was to elect 300 members of parliament. However, the "Democratic Union," which won the majority of votes in the election, was only allocated 139 seats, while the "National Radical Union," which won fewer votes, instead received a majority of 161 seats. This unreasonable phenomenon is the result of the Greek ruling group's manipulation of the electoral system. The electoral system promulgated shortly before the general election is a very complex but inconsistent electoral system. For example, it stipulates that in some constituencies, the party with a simple majority of votes can win all the seats in that constituency; while in other constituencies, it stipulates that the party with a majority of votes can win two-thirds of the seats, and the party with the second most votes can win one-third of the seats; in yet other constituencies, it stipulates that seats are allocated proportionally according to the number of votes received. The purpose of this electoral system, carefully formulated by the Greek ruling group, is to seize a majority of seats in parliament at a time when the situation is already unfavorable to it. Former Prime Minister Papandreou, who participated in the "Democratic Union," correctly pointed out after the general election: "The election law has turned the majority of the people into a minority of parliamentarians."

    However, despite the fact that the "National Radical Union" has an unreasonable electoral system to serve it, thereby seizing some seats from the "Democratic Union," the "National Radical Union" can only occupy a slight majority in parliament. This makes the "National Radical Union's" position far from stable even if it continues to be in power.

    A distinct feature of this Greek general election is that almost all opposition parties have formed a united front under the name of the "Democratic Union" to confront the ruling group's "National Radical Union." The "National Radical Union" is a disguised organization of the "Greek People's Alliance," which has been in power in recent years. The "Democratic Union" was formed six days after the government announced the date of the general election, and it includes parties with broad representation such as the Liberal Party, the People's Party, the Liberal Democratic Union, the National Central Progressive Union, the Labor People's Democratic Party, the Peasant Party, and the Left-wing Democratic Union. These parties are not without distances and differences in their respective programs and propositions, but this does not prevent them from having common views on some major issues concerning the fate of the country. The "Democratic Union's" election platform is the product of the unified will of these parties. This platform advocates the implementation of a national policy, demanding the defense of national dignity and Greece's national sovereignty, promptly granting Cyprus the right to self-determination, restoring a truly free and democratic national system, abolishing emergency measures and the exile of political prisoners, implementing amnesty and equal proportional representation electoral system, and pursuing an economic policy that protects the Greek people from economic oligarchic exploitation.

    The formation of this united front of broad strata and the fact that it won a majority of votes in the general election show how deep the dissatisfaction of the broad strata of Greece with the policy of unilaterally linking the country with the Western military bloc has reached.

    It is known that Greece was the first victim of the American "strength policy." The "Truman Doctrine" of 1948 was implemented in Greece. Due to this aggressive policy of the United States, Greece was dragged into the North Atlantic Group. This group, as former Greek Foreign Minister Venizelos said, "grants certain countries the rights of masters and imposes the obligations of slaves on other countries." The master of this group—the United States—treats Greece as its own and arbitrarily interferes in its internal affairs. This situation, even United Press reporter Ridley believed in his report before the election, was "excessively arrogant," causing many Greeks to "feel anger." What particularly angered the broad strata of people in Greece was that its allies in the North Atlantic Group exerted pressure on Greece on the Cyprus issue, forcing it to abandon its national aspirations and insulting it. The damage that the North Atlantic policy has brought to Greece's national interests has made it difficult for the Greek people to tolerate it.

    The poor state of domestic economic life in Greece is another consequence of implementing the North Atlantic policy. Due to its participation in the North Atlantic military bloc, the heavy burden of expanding armaments and preparing for war has been placed on Greece. For several years, military expenditures have often accounted for more than half of the Greek budget, and these funds have been spent on building air force bases and other military facilities for the United States on Greek territory. The corrosive effect of this huge military budget on the national economy is constantly expanding. The French "Express" wrote on November 17 last year: "Greece now has to spend half of its budget on military expenditures, and this is happening at a time when its increasingly difficult financial situation is causing living expenses to rise rapidly (up 40% in two years) and national production is declining. Recent statistics show that one-third of the population (2.4 million people) has an income of less than 100 francs per day; 1.8 million people have an income of less than 50 francs per day. Among the surplus population of working age, there are 900,000 young people whose living standards are still not as good as before the war."

    Indeed, inflation, rising prices, increased taxes, and declining production have become increasingly serious phenomena in Greek domestic economic life. This has caused extreme poverty for the people. Even the Greek Minister of Welfare has publicly admitted that one-third of the country's population holds poverty certificates issued by the authorities.

    In addition, it should also be mentioned that hundreds of patriots have been detained in concentration camps, suffering torture and the threat of death, because they oppose American interference and strive for national independence, democracy, and freedom. This cannot but arouse the growing indignation of the Greek people.

    The Greek people's opposition to the North Atlantic policy and their dissatisfaction with the poor status quo are the driving force behind the formation of the broad patriotic united front in this general election, and the fundamental reason why this united front is supported by a majority of voters. The election on February 19 expressed the opinions of the Greek people, who voted in favor of peace, independence, and democracy. This will of the Greek people shows a powerful force, which will have an increasingly important impact on the future of Greece.

    希腊人民投票赞成和平、独立和民主
    胡思升
    希腊在2月19日举行了议会选举。主张维护希腊民族利益、坚决保卫塞浦路斯自决权、奉行独立政策的“民主联盟”获得了多数选票——176万多票，当政集团的“国民激进联盟”只获得158万多票。这是希腊国内政治力量对比的重大变化。这种变化生动地显示：追随美国、参加军事集团和扩军备战的政策在希腊已经遭到了人民的唾弃；而要求奉行独立自主的政策的呼声是越来越强大了。
    无怪乎美国资产阶级报纸大感不安，认为希腊选举的结果“是令人失望的”、“是一种令人非常不愉快的情况”。这种情绪是完全可以理解的。因为这次选举的结果是对美国在希腊推行“实力政策”的一个有力的打击，是美国侵略性对外政策的一个失败。
    这次希腊议会选举要选出300个议员。但是在选举中获多数票的“民主联盟”却只分配得139席，而获少数票的“国民激进联盟”反而得到161席的多数席位。这种不合理的现象是希腊当政集团在选举制度上玩弄花样的结果。在大选前不久颁布的选举制度，是一种十分复杂的但又不统一的选举制度。例如规定在有些选区，得简单多数票的党可以获得这个选区的全部席位；而在另外一些选区，又规定得多数票的党可以获得席位的三分之二，得票次多的获得席位的三分之一；在又一些选区，又规定按得票多少成比例地分配席位。希腊当政集团精心制定的这种选举制度，其目的就是要在形势对它已显得不利的时候，来借此夺取议会的多数席位。参加“民主联盟”的前首相帕潘德里欧在大选后正确地指出：“选举法把人民的多数变成了议员少数”。
    但是，尽管“国民激进联盟”有不合理的选举制度为它服务，从而在“民主联盟”那里多夺得了一些席位，然而，“国民激进联盟”在议会中也只能占微弱的多数。这就使得“国民激进联盟”即使继续当政，它的地位也远不是稳定的。
    这次希腊大选的一个鲜明特色，就是几乎所有的在野党派都结成一个以“民主联盟”为名称的统一战线来同当权集团的“国民激进联盟”对抗。“国民激进联盟”就是近年来执政的“希腊人民联盟”的变相组织。“民主联盟”是在政府宣布大选日期后六天组成的，它包括自由党、人民党、自由民主联盟、全国中派进步联盟、劳动人民民主党、农民党和左翼民主联盟这样一些具有广泛代表性的党派。这些党派在各自的纲领和主张上并不是没有距离和分歧的，但是这并不妨碍它们在一些有关国家命运的重大问题上有着共同的看法。“民主联盟”的竞选纲领就是这些党派统一意志的产物，这个纲领主张实行民族的政策，要求保卫民族尊严和希腊的国家主权、迅速给塞浦路斯以自决权，恢复真正自由和民主的国家制度，取消紧急状态和流放政治犯的措施，实行大赦和平等的比例代表选举制，奉行使希腊人民不受经济寡头剥削的经济政策。
    这种广泛阶层的统一战线的组成以及它在大选中的获得多数选票的事实，说明了希腊广泛阶层对于把国家片面地和西方军事集团联结起来的政策的不满已经到了何等深刻的程度了。
    人们知道，希腊是美国“实力政策”的第一个牺牲品。1948年的“杜鲁门主义”就是在希腊的身上开始执行的。由于美国的这种侵略政策，希腊被拖入了北大西洋集团。这个集团如希腊前外交大臣维尼齐洛斯所说的：“以主宰者的权利给予某些国家，并且以奴隶的义务强加在另外一些国家身上。”这个集团的主宰者——美国，对希腊以主人自居，恣意干涉它的内政，这种情形连美国合众社记者里德莱在这次选举前的报道中也认为“过分嚣张”了，以致使许多希腊人“感到激怒”。使希腊广泛阶层人士特别愤慨的是，它的北大西洋集团的盟国，在塞浦路斯问题上对希腊横施压力，压迫它放弃民族愿望并加以侮辱。北大西洋政策对希腊的民族利益所带来的损害，已使希腊人民对此难以容忍。
    希腊国内经济生活的恶劣状况，是执行北大西洋政策所造成的又一恶果。由于参加了北大西洋军事集团，扩军备战的重担便压在了希腊的头上。几年来，军事费用经常占希腊预算的一半以上，这些资金都耗费在希腊领土上为美国建筑空军基地和其他军事设备上。这种庞大的军事预算对国民经济的腐蚀性影响正在不断扩大。法国“快报”去年11月17日写道：“希腊现在不得不把它的一半预算用在军事支出之上，而且这又发生在它的日甚一日的财政困难引起生活费用迅速高涨（两年内涨了40％）以及国民生产下降的时候。最近的统计数字表明三分之一的人口（240万人）的收入每天不到100法郎；180万人的每天收入不到50法郎。到达工作年龄的剩余人口中青年就有90万，生活水平仍然比不上战前。”
    的确，通货膨胀、物价上涨、赋税增加以及生产的萎缩已成为希腊国内经济生活中日益严重的现象。这造成了人民的极端贫困。连希腊福利大臣也公开承认，全国有三分之一的人口持有当局发给的穷苦证明书。
    此外，还应该提到，有成千上百的爱国者由于他们反对美国的干涉、争取民族独立和民主、自由而被拘禁在集中营里，受着折磨和死亡的威胁。这也不能不引起希腊人民日益增长的愤慨。
    希腊人民反对北大西洋政策和他们对于恶劣的现状的不满，是组成这次大选中的广泛爱国统一战线的动力，也是这个统一战线受到多数选民拥护的根本原因。2月19日的选举表达了希腊人民的意见，他们投票赞成和平、独立和民主。希腊人民的这种意志显示了强大的力量，它对希腊的未来将发生日益重要的影响。
