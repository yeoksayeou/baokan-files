    Turning a Mud Seawall into a Stone Seawall
    To the Editor:
    Qingli Township in Daishan County, Zhejiang Province, is a salt-producing area. The terrain here is backed by mountains on three sides and faces the sea on one side. In the past, it suffered from typhoons and tidal disasters every year, and the people lived in poverty. The surrounding people call the estuary of this township a "bitter gate."
    In the spring of 1955, under the leadership of the Party branch, the township built a 1,300-meter-long seawall. The seawall blocked the tides, increasing salt production by about 20% compared to the past, and rice also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.
    However, this seawall was made of mud. Under the impact of strong winds and waves, it collapsed five times since last autumn. The salt farmers are determined to turn the mud seawall into a stone seawall. However, it is estimated that the stone materials and labor costs required to build a stone seawall would be more than 10,000 yuan. Where to raise this money?
    In the winter of 1955, the township expanded an old cooperative and established six new cooperatives. Under the unified leadership of the township branch, these cooperatives put forward the slogan of "building a good seawall without spending money." The seven cooperatives united all the mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the township, and everyone worked together to find stones, collecting more than 1,200 cubic meters of stone in one month. The Party branch also organized people who knew how to do masonry work as technical workers, responsible for the construction work. Soon after, a solid stone seawall was built on the coast, providing a more reliable guarantee for the township's salt production and agricultural production.

### 把泥海塘变成石海塘

    把泥海塘变成石海塘
    编辑同志：
    浙江岱山县青里乡是个产盐区。这里的地势是三面背山，一面朝海。过去年年遭受台风和海潮的灾害，群众生活很贫苦。周围的老百姓都管这个乡的大海口叫“苦门”。
    1955年春天，在党支部的领导下，这个乡修筑了一个1，300公尺长的大海塘。大塘挡住了海潮，使盐的产量比过去提高了20％左右，水稻也得到了从未有过的丰收。
    但是，这个海塘是泥做的。它在狂风大浪的冲击下，去年秋季以来先后塌了五次。盐民们下决心要把泥塘变成石塘。可是，据估计，修石塘需要的石料和人工费用在一万元以上。到那里去筹措这笔钱呢？
    1955年冬天，乡里扩大了一个老社，新建了六个新社。在乡支部统一领导下，这些合作社提出了“不花钱也要修好海塘”的口号。七个社团结了全乡互助组和单干户，大家一齐动手找石头，在一个月的时间里就搜集了1，200多方石块。党支部又把会做泥水活的人组织起来当技术工，负责砌筑工作。不久以后，坚固的石海塘就在海口上修建起来了。使这个乡盐业生产和农业生产有了更可靠的保障。
