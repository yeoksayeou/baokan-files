Jin Baoshan's Speech

    Chairman, fellow members:
    I fully support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of the other leaders. After reading Chairman Zhou Enlai's report on the issue of intellectuals at the CPC Central Committee meeting, I felt that the report was both thorough and correct. The CPC Central Committee's decision to vigorously strengthen the leadership of intellectuals will ensure that existing problems are resolved as quickly as possible, and that the strength of intellectuals is fully developed and grown. The Party and the government's attention and care for intellectuals are truly meticulous and inspiring. The current problem is how intellectuals themselves should strive for self-transformation. I am an intellectual who has been working for the government for six years. If I reflect on my ideological and work situation in the past few years according to the method of reflection proposed by Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, I feel very ashamed. I ask myself:
    First: Are we not active enough in serving the people and serving socialist construction?
    My answer is definitely not enough. I am a medical student, patriotic, and want to do some work for the people. In early 1948, I left my position in the Kuomintang reactionary regime, but blindly took a job with the United Nations. The extremely unreasonable and unfair situation within the United Nations, which was controlled by American imperialism, was unbearable. In January 1950, I abandoned my position in the United Nations and returned to the embrace of the motherland. The Party and the government gave me the position I deserved. However, I was not very active in my work in the new environment, and did not take the initiative in any work. During my time working at the Ministry of Health, I often emphasized the lack of clear responsibilities and did not make any noteworthy contributions.
    Second: Have we really contributed to expanding the team and uniting internal forces?
    My answer is: the contribution is extremely small. Over the years, I have often emphasized that I am old and often have a guest mentality. I have not taken the initiative to play a bridging role between leaders and cadres, and between working cadres. In particular, I have not actively reflected the opinions of the masses to the Party, nor have I actively leaned towards the Party, but have only unilaterally waited for the Party to contact me.
    Third: Are we highly conscious and not lax in learning Marxism-Leninism and advanced experience?
    My answer is: I cannot maintain consistency in my study of Marxism-Leninism. In the past few years, I have only received great education in several major political movements, but my perspective on problems in daily work is often not comprehensive enough. Therefore, I cannot talk about truly learning Marxism-Leninism. For example, after reading Comrade He Cheng's self-criticism of his erroneous thinking in health work, I felt that my view of the issue of traditional Chinese medicine at that time was basically not very different from that of Comrade He Cheng, which was of course wrong. It was not until the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao pointed out the errors in the implementation of the policy on traditional Chinese medicine that I began to have a new understanding.
    The above are just a small part of the shortcomings in my daily work. My evaluation of myself is that in such a glorious and powerful new China, I am really a slow-progressing member of the intellectual ranks. However, I believe that the vast majority of intellectuals are patriotic, love their professions, are unwilling to fall behind in their studies, and sincerely support the Party's policies. The urgent problem today is the self-transformation of intellectuals and how to unleash their potential. I am sixty-three years old this year, which is not too old, and I must follow the ranks of intellectuals and strive forward under the leadership of the Party.
    Under the care of the Party, I have received a lot of education in the past great political movements. Last November, I also participated in the Zhejiang inspection group of the CPPCC and went to my hometown area, which I had not returned to for more than 40 years. I saw that agricultural cooperatives were developing vigorously, and the thriving atmosphere was gratifying. What was particularly exciting was that the vast rural health problems, which were considered impossible to solve before liberation, can now be solved quickly and thoroughly under the conditions of agricultural cooperativization. For example, the work of eliminating schistosomiasis is vigorously promoting the "two managements and one elimination" (managing manure, managing water sources, and eliminating snails) and a comprehensive treatment of patients with a four-pronged approach. If the entire rural population is not mobilized and organized, and every household is responsible and everyone takes action, it will never be possible to achieve. I had been doing health work for a long time in the Kuomintang reactionary regime, which did not benefit the people at all and wasted most of my life's efforts. The second half of my life has finally entered such a bright era, and I truly feel that life is meaningful.
    Occupational diseases, common diseases, epidemics, and general diseases in urban factories and mines, and the problems required in the "National Agricultural Development Program": eliminating the four pests, eliminating the nine major diseases, and protecting women and children, are all urgently awaiting the vigorous promotion of medical and health work. However, the number and quality of these professional personnel are far from keeping up with the development of the new situation. I must muster enthusiasm, strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and advanced experience, especially the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; in the educational work position, in addition to participating in a few necessary administrative work and social activities, I should spend as much time as possible on improving professional courses, training teachers, carrying out scientific research, and cultivating new forces.
    One point in Chairman Zhou Enlai's report that particularly excited me was: "We should include ideological and political talks with them and comrade-style criticism of them in the plan for transforming intellectuals." I believe that doing so will greatly strengthen the relationship between intellectuals and the Party. I sincerely hope that under the leadership of the Party, I will actively rely on the Party, sincerely accept the Party's criticism, conduct self-education and self-transformation through criticism and self-criticism, and do the educational work I am currently engaged in well, so that when entering socialism, I will not be ashamed to be a member of the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

    金宝善的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和各首长的报告。我读了周恩来主席在中共中央会议所作的关于知识分子问题的报告，觉得这个报告讲得既透彻又正确。中共中央决定要大力加强知识分子的领导，必使现在存在着的问题尽可能迅速地得到解决，使知识分子的力量得到充分的发挥和成长。党和政府对于知识分子的重视和关怀真是无微不至，十分令人振奋。现在的问题是知识分子本身如何来努力进行自我改造。我是一个知识分子，参加政府工作已有6年。若按郭沫若副主席所提的反省方法，来反省我这几年来思想情况和工作情况，真感到十分惭愧。我自问：
    第一：我们为人民服务，为社会主义建设服务，是不是有不够积极的地方？
    我的回答是肯定不够的。我是一个学医的，是爱国的，是想要为人民做些工作的。1948年初脱离了国民党反动政权里的职务，但又盲目地就了联合国的职务。在美帝国主义操纵下的联合国的内幕里，那种极不合理的极不公平的情况令人不堪忍受。1950年1月弃掉了联合国的职务，回到祖国的怀抱，党和政府给了我应有的地位。但是我在新的环境里工作很不积极，一切工作没有争取主动。在卫生部工作的一段时间，经常强调职责不明，没有作出可以值得指出的工作。
    第二：我们在扩大队伍和团结内部力量上，是不是真正有所贡献？
    我的回答是：贡献极微。几年来我经常强调年老，常有作客情绪。在领导与干部之间和工作干部彼此之间我没有主动地起到桥梁作用。尤其对党不积极地反映群众意见，不积极地靠拢党，只片面地等待党来联系。
    第三：我们在学习马克思列宁主义，学习先进经验上，是不是有高度的自觉，是不是没有懈怠？
    我的回答是：我在马克思列宁主义的学习上是不能保持经常的。几年来只在几次巨大的政治运动中得了很大的教育，但在日常工作中看问题是往往不够全面的。因此，谈不上真正学习了马克思列宁主义。譬如我看了贺诚同志在卫生工作中错误思想的自我检讨之后，我觉得我当时对中医问题的看法基本上同贺诚同志是没有很大区别的，这当然是错误的。直到党中央和毛主席指出执行中医政策的错误以后，才开始有了新的认识。
    以上是不过举出我日常工作中的一小部分的缺点。我给自己的评价，在这样辉煌强大的新中国社会里，我实在是知识分子队伍里的一个进步缓慢的分子。但是我相信，绝大多数的知识分子是爱国的，是热爱专业的，在学习上是不甘心落后的，是衷心拥护党的政策的。今天的迫切问题是在知识分子自我改造和如何发挥潜力。我今年六十三岁了，还不算老，一定要跟着知识分子的队伍，在党的领导下向前努力迈进。
    我在党的关怀下，在历次伟大的政治运动中受了不少教育。去年11月又参加政协浙江视察团，到了40多年没有回去过的家乡地区，看到农业合作社正在蓬勃地发展，那种欣欣向荣的气象，令人喜悦。特别感到兴奋的是在解放以前认为不可能解决的广大的农村卫生问题，现在在农业合作化的条件下可以很迅速地彻底地解决了。如血吸虫病的消灭工作，正在大力推行两管一灭（管理粪便，管理水源和扑灭钉螺）和全面治疗病人的四面进攻办法，如果没有农村全体人民发动组织起来，家家负责，人人动手，是决不可能实现的。我在国民党反动政权里曾做了长时期的卫生工作，对于人民毫无补益，白费了大半生的心血。我的后半生终于进入了这样光明的时代，真正感到人生是有意义了。
    城市厂矿的职业病、多发病、流行病、一般疾病，和在“全国农业发展纲要”所要求的：清除四害，消灭九大疾病和保护妇婴等问题都迫切地等着医药卫生工作的大力推行。但是这一专业人员的数量和质量还远远赶不上新形势的发展。我必须鼓起热情，加强学习马克思列宁主义和先进的特别是苏联的先进经验；在教育的工作岗位上，除参加少数必需的行政工作和社会活动之外，尽量地把时间放在专业课程的提高，师资的训练，开展科学研究工作和培养新生力量。
    在周恩来主席的报告中特别使我兴奋的一点是：“我们应该把同他们进行思想上政治上的谈话，对他们进行同志式的批评，定在改造知识分子的计划以内”。我相信，这样做一定会大大地密切知识分子和党的关系。我十分希望在党领导下，积极地依靠党，诚恳地接受党的批评，以批评和自我批评方法进行自我教育和自我改造，做好现在我所担任的教育工作，以期在进入社会主义时不愧为工、农、知识分子联盟的一分子。
