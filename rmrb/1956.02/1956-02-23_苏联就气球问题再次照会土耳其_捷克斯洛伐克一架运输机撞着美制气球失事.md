Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd, Moscow Dispatch: Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko received Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kavur on February 20th and handed him a second note from the Soviet government regarding the issue of balloons being launched into Soviet airspace from Turkish territory.

    In the note, the Soviet government refuted the arguments put forward by the Turkish government in its reply to the Soviet government on February 11th with specific facts. The Turkish government admitted that in the past, with the cooperation of the American authorities, it had launched balloons from Turkish territory; however, it insisted that the purpose of launching the balloons was for meteorological observation and that they posed no danger to air traffic.

    The Soviet government stated that if it were necessary to prove the correctness of the points raised by the Soviet government, the Soviet government would be willing, with the approval of the governments concerned, to exhibit the intercepted balloons and their devices in these countries; or Turkey could send its specialists to Moscow to study them.

    In the note, the Soviet government also reiterated that launching such balloons into Soviet airspace is a blatant violation of the inviolability of Soviet territory and universally recognized principles of international law.

    The Soviet note stated that the Soviet government noted the Turkish government's statement that it would take steps to prevent any further balloons from being launched from Turkish territory into Soviet airspace.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 22nd: The official statement released by the Czechoslovakian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a press conference held in Prague on the afternoon of February 21st announced that the cause of the Czechoslovakian transport plane crash near the town of Levoča in Slovakia on January 18th was a collision with one of the balloons that the United States has been organizing to launch into Czechoslovakian airspace from its bases in West Germany.

    This conclusion was reached after a special committee conducted a detailed on-site investigation and heard testimony from numerous witnesses (including survivors). Witnesses said that on January 17th and 18th, they saw balloons used by the American organization to drop slanderous leaflets in the area where the accident occurred. Fragments of the balloon were found near the wreckage of the plane.

    At the time of the plane crash, 22 passengers (including crew members) were killed, and 4 people were seriously injured.

    苏联就气球问题再次照会土耳其
    捷克斯洛伐克一架运输机撞着美制气球失事
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯在2月20日接见土耳其驻苏联大使卡伏尔，把苏联政府关于从土耳其领土上向苏联领空放送气球问题的第二次照会交给他。
    苏联政府在照会中以具体的事实，驳斥了土耳其政府在2月11日给苏联政府的复照中提出的论据。土耳其政府承认，在过去一些时候，土耳其政府曾经在美国当局的合作下，从土耳其境内放出气球；但是，它硬说，放出气球的目的是进行气象观测，对于空中交通没有危险。
    苏联政府表示，假如有必要证明苏联政府所指出的各点的正确性，苏联政府愿意在获得有关政府的认可的情况下，在这些国家展览截获的气球和上面的装置；或者由土耳其派遣它的专门人员到莫斯科来加以研究。
    苏联政府在照会中还重申，向苏联领空放出这种气球是粗暴地破坏苏联领土的神圣不可侵犯性和普遍承认的国际法原则的。
    苏联的照会说，苏联政府注意到了土耳其政府所发表的关于它将采取步骤来防止再有任何气球从土耳其领土向苏联领空放出的声明。
    新华社布拉格22日电　捷克斯洛伐克共和国外交部21日下午在布拉格举行的记者招待会上发表的正式声明宣布，1月18日在斯洛伐克的莱伏查城附近发生的捷克斯洛伐克运输机失事事件的原因，是撞着了美国组织一直在从它们在西德的基地上向捷克斯洛伐克的领空放送的气球中的一个。
    这个结论是在专门委员会进行了详细的现场调查和听取了许多见证人（包括幸存者）的作证以后得出的。见证人说，在1月17日和18日，他们在发生事故的地区看到美国组织用来投掷诬蔑性传单的气球。在飞机残骸附近发现了这个气球的碎片。
    在飞机坠毁的时候，有22个旅客（包括机务人员）遭难，有4个人受重伤。
