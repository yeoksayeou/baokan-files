    Youth is the most active and vibrant part of the entire social force. Therefore, the Party and the state have always regarded the younger generation as a shock force in the revolutionary struggle. In the current great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the Party and the state especially value the enormous role of the younger generation. Can the youth in the industrial and commercial sectors, as a part of the entire Chinese youth, also play an active role in the cause of socialist construction? Can they also strive for a bright and promising future together with the youth of the whole country? The convening of the National Congress of Young Activists in Industry and Commerce fully affirms this point. The convening of this congress fully demonstrates that the Party and the state, like valuing and caring for the youth in other positions, value and care for the role of the youth in industry and commerce in the cause of socialist construction. The youth in the industrial and commercial sectors, especially the activists, have played an active leading role in previous patriotic movements. Especially in the recent high tide of the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, they have shown unprecedented enthusiasm, and a large number of activists have emerged. For example, in Tianjin, more than 50% of the youth in industry and commerce participated in the joint state-private ownership work teams. More than 60 young capitalists in the Fourth District of Tianjin took the initiative after the implementation of joint state-private ownership to launch "Good Service Attitude Month" in commerce and activities to "improve business management, improve technology, and save raw materials" in industry.

    The implementation of joint state-private ownership of entire trades in the vast majority of capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises is a great victory in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. However, it should be recognized that this is far from a complete victory of the transformation, but only the beginning of a deep transformation. Following this, there is a series of arduous tasks to be done, such as inventorying and verifying assets, improving business management, and developing production and business. In all of these tasks, there is an even more complex task, which is the transformation of people. The transformation of enterprises and the transformation of people are two aspects of one content of the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and the two are closely linked and inseparable. To transform people from the exploiting class into people of the working class, of course, arduous and meticulous ideological education work must be carried out. Young activists in industry and commerce should play a leading role in this education and transformation work, helping the state to better complete the transformation of people of the bourgeoisie, thereby accelerating the completion of the transformation of capitalist enterprises.

    How can young activists in industry and commerce intensify their self-transformation in the socialist transformation of enterprises?

    Young activists in industry and commerce should regard the work arranged by the state as the best opportunity to transform themselves and serve the country, and happily accept the work assigned to them by the state. The state's arrangements for private sector personnel are based on the principle of using talent according to their abilities. Some private sector personnel will take on management and technical work in enterprises, and some may continue to participate in actual production operations and physical labor. Whether it is engaging in management and technical work or directly participating in production labor, it has two aspects of significance for bourgeois elements: on the one hand, it is contributing their useful labor to socialist construction, and on the other hand, it is also conducting practical training for the transformation of capitalists themselves. Therefore, one should not have worried thoughts or selfish plans about the work arranged by the state. Such plans and thoughts are manifestations of bourgeois consciousness, and they will hinder private sector personnel from accepting the state's transformation.

    After accepting the arrangements, it is necessary to do the work with a positive and proactive attitude. Those with business management experience should improve the business management of the enterprise, and those with technical capabilities should contribute their technical capabilities. For example, Zhao Yonghai, a young technician from the private sector of the Zhaobaotang Filature in Hangzhou, who attended this conference, after the implementation of joint state-private ownership of the enterprise, worked hard to study technology and created an electric automatic stop-head winding machine, which can not only reduce labor intensity but also improve product quality. Work efficiency has increased threefold, and costs have been reduced by 80%. This creation has been promoted in the Jingwei Factory. As for those who did not have labor habits in the past, they should develop labor habits in the transformation, and those who lack labor skills should also learn labor skills in the transformation. For example, Zhang Mingshu and Zheng Xingmin, private sector personnel from the Bengbu Maltose Factory, originally had neither labor habits nor labor skills. After accepting the arrangements made by the state, they earnestly transformed themselves and worked hard to learn technology, and now they have mastered a set of production technologies. This is the only way for all private sector personnel to transform themselves and contribute to socialist construction.

    Young activists in industry and commerce must pay special attention to learning from workers, relying on workers, and thoroughly changing the bourgeois views that despise workers, are unwilling to approach workers, and do not believe in the wisdom and creativity of workers. Learning from workers and relying on workers is not only a necessary condition for improving the management of socialist enterprises, but also a prerequisite for bourgeois elements to transform themselves. Liu Zhuoquan, a technician from the private sector who served as a technician in the Tianjin Joint State-Private Lihe Weaving Company, originally rarely went to the workshop and looked down on the workers; once, due to poor color matching, the printed bed sheets had defects in the pattern, and the workers suggested improvements, but he did not accept them. Later, the workers took the initiative to improve the printing method and improved the quality of the bed sheet patterns. Under the education of the facts, Liu Zhuoquan finally believed in the collective wisdom and creativity of the workers, so he changed his view of the workers, began to establish a system of regular contact with the workshop, and often went to the workshop to listen to the workers' opinions and improve his technical work.

    Young activists in industry and commerce should also become activists in studying the policies of the Party and the state, and in studying Marxism-Leninism, so as to improve their socialist consciousness, better grasp their own destiny, and be able to accept the education and transformation of the Party and the state more happily and consciously. For example, Xu Tiancai, a young capitalist from the Zhengzhou Joint State-Private Xinmin Iron Factory who attended this conference, was once eager to remove the "capitalist" label and asked to resign several times, unwilling to continue operating the enterprise. After studying the policies of the Party and the state, he understood that only under the leadership of the Party and the state and the supervision of the workers, on the basis of running the enterprise well, can he transform himself and have a bright future; therefore, he actively improved business management and improved production efficiency, so that the 1955 production plan of the Xinmin Iron Factory was completed 20 days ahead of schedule.

    The task facing the youth in industry and commerce nationwide is arduous and glorious. The Party and the state are expecting you, and the broad masses are looking forward to you. You must not be arrogant, look down on people, fail to learn from others, or actively help and promote the people around you to advance together with you. If an advanced element adopts this attitude, he may become a backward element. The youth in industry and commerce should continue to be at the forefront of the socialist transformation movement of capitalist industry and commerce, play an active leading role, and lead the remaining bourgeois elements to further improve business management, further increase production, further improve product quality and reduce product costs, maintain the variety and characteristics of enterprises, and better serve the people.

    I wish this conference a successful outcome.

### 发挥工商界青年在社会主义改造中的积极作用

    发挥工商界青年在社会主义改造中的积极作用
    青年是整个社会力量中最积极最有生气的一部分。因此，党和国家从来都是把青年一代看作革命斗争中的一支突击力量。在目前的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业中，党和国家尤其重视青年一代的巨大作用。作为中国全体青年一部分的工商界的青年，是不是也可以在社会主义建设事业中发挥积极作用呢？是不是也可以和全国青年一道争取自己光明远大的前途呢？全国工商界青年积极分子大会的召开，完全肯定了这一点，召开这次大会，充分说明党和国家像重视和关怀其它岗位上的青年一样，重视和关怀着工商界青年在社会主义建设事业中的作用。工商界的青年特别是积极分子，在历次的爱国运动中，都曾起过积极的带头的作用，尤其在最近的资本主义工商业的改造高潮中，更表现了他们空前的积极性，出现了大批的积极分子。例如天津市就有50％以上的工商界青年参加了公私合营的工作队。天津市第四区有60多个青年资本家在公私合营以后倡议在商业中开展“服务态度良好月”和在工业中开展“改进经营管理，提高技术，节约原材料”的活动。
    全国绝大部分资本主义工商业实行了全行业的公私合营，这是改造资本主义工商业的一个伟大胜利。但应该认识，这远远不是改造的完全胜利，而仅仅是深入改造的开始，接着还有清产核资，改善经营管理，发展生产和业务等等一系列艰巨的工作要作。而在所有这些工作中，还有一项更复杂的工作，就是对人的改造。对企业的改造和对人的改造，是对资本主义工商业改造的一个内容的两个方面，两者是紧密联系的，不可分割的。要把剥削阶级的人改造成劳动阶级的人，当然要进行艰苦细致的思想教育工作。工商界的青年积极分子应该在这个教育和改造工作中起带头作用，帮助国家更好地完成对资产阶级的人的改造，从而加速完成对资本主义企业的改造。
    工商界的青年积极分子怎样在企业的社会主义改造中加紧改造自己呢？
    工商界的青年积极分子应该把国家安排的工作看成改造自己和为国家效力的最好机会，愉快地接受国家安排给自己的工作。国家对资方人员的安排是按照量才使用的原则的。有些资方人员要担任企业中的管理工作和技术工作，有些资方人员可能要继续参加实际的生产操作和体力劳动。不管是担任管理和技术工作也好，也不管是直接参加生产劳动也好，对于资产阶级分子来说都有两方面的意义：一方面都是为社会主义建设贡献自己有益的劳动，另一方面也是为了改造资本家自己而进行实际的锻炼。因此，对国家安排的工作不应该有患得患失的想法，自私自利的打算，这种打算和想法都是资产阶级意识的表现，它会妨碍资方人员接受国家的改造。
    在接受安排以后，就要以积极主动的态度作好工作。有经营管理经验的要改善企业的经营管理，有技术能力的要贡献出自己的技术能力。例如出席这次大会的杭州市赵保堂拈丝厂的资方从业人员青年技术员赵永海，在企业公私合营以后，努力钻研技术，创造了电力自动停头杠车，既能减轻劳动强度，又能提高产品质量，工作效率提高三倍，成本降低80％。这一创造已在经纬厂推广。至于那些过去没有劳动习惯的应该在改造中养成劳动习惯，缺乏劳动技能的，也应该在改造中学会劳动技能。比如蚌埠市饴糖厂资方人员张铭枢和郑醒民原来是既没有劳动习惯，也没有劳动技能的，在接受国家安排以后，他们认真地改造自己和刻苦地学习技术，现在已经掌握了一套生产技术。这是一切资方人员要改造自己和为社会主义建设出力的唯一途径。
    工商界的青年积极分子，必须特别注意向工人学习，注意依靠工人，彻底改变那种轻视工人，不愿意同工人接近，不相信工人的智慧和创造能力的资产阶级的观点。向工人学习和依靠工人不但是改善社会主义企业经营管理的必要条件，对资产阶级分子来说，也是改造自己的前提。天津公私合营利和织物公司担任技师的资方人员刘濯泉原来就是经常不下车间，瞧不起工人的；一次由于配色不好，印出来的床单花色有毛病，工人提出改进意见，他不接受，后来工人主动地改进了印刷方法，提高了床单花色的质量。刘濯泉在事实的教育下，最后相信了工人的集体智慧和创造能力，于是改变了自己对工人的看法，开始和车间建立了定期联系的制度，并经常到车间听取工人的意见，改进自己的技术工作。
    工商界的青年积极分子也应该成为学习党和国家的政策，学习马克思列宁主义的积极分子，以便提高自己的社会主义觉悟，更好地掌握自己的命运，从而能够更愉快地更自觉地接受党和国家的教育和改造。例如出席这次大会的郑州市公私合营新民铁工厂的青年资本家徐天才，曾经急于要摘掉资本家的“帽子”，几次要求辞职，不愿继续经营企业。经过学习党和国家的政策以后，懂得了只有在党和国家的领导下和工人的监督下，在办好企业的基础上来改造自己，才有自己光明的前途；于是，他积极改善经营管理，提高生产效率，使1955年新民铁工厂的生产计划提前20天完成。
    摆在全国工商界青年面前的任务是艰巨的，也是光荣的。党和国家在期待着你们，广大群众在盼望着你们。你们决不可以骄傲自大，看不起人，不向别人学习，也不积极地去帮助和推动周围的人和自己一道前进。如果一个先进分子采取了这种态度，他就可能变成一个落后分子。工商界的青年应该继续走在资本主义工商业社会主义改造运动的前列，发挥积极带头作用，带动其余资产阶级分子，进一步改善经营管理，进一步增加生产，进一步提高产品质量和降低产品成本，保持企业的品种和特点，更好地为人民服务。
    祝这次大会胜利成功。
