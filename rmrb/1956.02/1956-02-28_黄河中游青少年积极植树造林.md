Young People in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River Actively Plant Trees and Create Forests

In the key areas of water and soil conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, namely Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan provinces (regions), nearly ten million young people are active on the front lines of planting trees, creating forests, and greening the motherland. According to incomplete statistics, since last autumn, the young people in these five provinces (regions) have planted nearly 260 million trees, afforested and cultivated forests covering an area of over 4 million mu, and collected more than 7.5 million jin of tree seeds.

The scale of tree planting and afforestation activities of young people in various provinces is very large. In Shaanxi Province, more than 3 million young people participated in afforestation activities this spring and last autumn, creating more than 60,000 mu of "Youth Forests" and "Children's Forests," and sporadically planting more than 20 million trees. In the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, young people created the "Yan'an Youth Forest" at Yangjialing, the site of the former CPC Central Committee. In Gansu Province, more than 3,600 young people in Helan County formed 23 afforestation shock brigades, completing the 30-li Yellow River bank protection forest, originally scheduled to be completed in three years, in just one day. Since last autumn, more than 1.4 million young people in Shanxi Province have collectively afforested 49,500 mu and sporadically planted more than 7.5 million trees on the Loess Plateau on the east bank of the Yellow River and along the Fen River, a tributary of the Yellow River. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as early as last autumn, Hetao had more than 1,300 young people who organized 55 shock brigades for afforestation. In 69 counties and cities, including Luoyang and Xuchang in Henan Province, according to incomplete statistics since last winter, there have been more than 54,900 youth afforestation teams (groups), with a total afforestation area of more than 532,000 mu.
