	Creating New Coal Mining Methods
	A new coal mining method successfully created by coal miners Pang Guanxiang and technician Zhou Guangrui of the Fushun Coal Mine has attracted the attention of Fushun coal miners. As early as the end of last December, at a forum held by the Tiger Terrace Mine Trade Union, Pang Guanxiang said in his speech: In the past, we wanted to produce more coal, but many backward and outdated rules and regulations restricted us. Although our team completed the state plan 58 days ahead of schedule this year, I always feel that only half of our energy has been used. In my opinion, if we want to produce more coal and complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, we must first change those outdated rules and standards that hinder the improvement of production. At that time, Pang Guanxiang proposed increasing the mining height and further implementing deep drilling and large blasting, and also proposed reforming the support methods to ensure the safety of such mining. Pang Guanxiang's suggestion particularly attracted the attention of technician Zhou Guangrui. Before this, Zhou Guangrui had considered this issue more than once, and considered it in connection with increasing the number of coal mining faces and the assembly line operation of mining by specialized types of work. Therefore, he actively supported Pang Guanxiang's opinion and put forward scientific basis. This forum was very good. Finally, the chairman of the meeting suggested that Zhou Guangrui should sort out Pang Guanxiang's suggestions and make a scientific and reasonable plan.
	After Zhou Guangrui studied for several nights, he went to discuss it with District Chief Ma Zhenhu and Party Branch Secretary Niu Qingye. They supported this creation and suggested immediately seeking the opinions of the miners. When the news reached the Party Committee of Tiger Terrace Mine, another topic scheduled for discussion that afternoon was postponed. The members listened to Zhou Guangrui's report with great enthusiasm, and everyone unanimously agreed with this valuable initiative. Yin Jiasheng, deputy secretary of the Party Committee who presided over the meeting, realized that there was a huge force hidden behind this initiative, and at the same time saw the other side of the matter. He said: The growth of a new thing will inevitably encounter difficulties. Sure enough, while the miners were enthusiastically discussing this new method, two technicians from the Fushun Mining Bureau came. One Technician Jiang was very dissatisfied when he heard that the unsupported roof distance was to exceed the conventional distance of 5.6 meters; despite people explaining the measures taken to him, he still disagreed with this approach. In this plan, the biggest reform was to open 40 meters of coal face at a time, which was naturally opposed. However, the creators and organizers of the new things were not intimidated by these. Zhou Yongfa, the chief engineer of the Tiger Terrace Mine, and Zhou Guangrui, went to the Fushun Mining Bureau to ask for instructions together. In the chief engineer's office of the Mining Bureau, the new thing encountered another test. Zhou Guangrui cautiously answered various questions being questioned at the meeting. The debate over mining height had just subsided, and that Technician Jiang said again: "Your blasting method will collapse the supports!" Immediately afterwards, someone asked: "What if the supports collapse?" At this time, Zhou Guangrui was also very excited, and he said: "The angle of the holes is straight, so the blasting force spreads up and down, and will not collapse the supports. I can write a guarantee." So the meeting fell silent. After a while, another technician raised a new question: "The distance of 1.1 meters between each hole does not meet the requirements of the calculation formula. The resistance line is too large, so it will not be able to be blasted open." Zhou Guangrui said: "This is the valuable opinion of the workers. I also used the formula you said to calculate, and it doesn't work either, but the workers on the scene opened it with such a distance. We should not be too rigid when looking at problems!" After a morning of debate, they finally broke through several obstacles, and finally everyone waited for the representative of the Fushun Mining Area National Technical Safety Supervision Bureau to express his opinion. This representative did not express any opinion, he just said he would go back and study it. Deputy Mine Manager Wang Zhenhai was afraid that the matter would be delayed, so he stood up and said: "A new thing, no matter how well you consider it, it will not be perfect. It is absolutely necessary to consider it as carefully as possible beforehand, but don't be afraid of everything!" Due to Wang Zhenhai's persistence, the research on the two people's proposal began that afternoon. At this time, the leaders of the Tiger Terrace Mine encouraged Zhou Guangrui to boldly fight against conservative ideas. From afternoon to evening, the proposals of Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui were supported by the Fushun Mining Area Committee of the Communist Party of China, breaking through the old rules and regulations, and approving the Tiger Terrace Mine to test the new coal mining method.
	When the miners created a new record on the first day of the experiment, it was approaching midnight. The miners' sweat-soaked shirts were covered with coal dust, and every dark face showed full of joy. Old District Chief Ma Zhenqing, who was sitting by the dispatch telephone, welcomed Zhou Guangrui and Pang Guanxiang as happily as if he were welcoming triumphant soldiers.

### 创造新的采煤方法

    创造新的采煤方法
    抚顺煤矿工人庞观祥和技术员周广瑞创造成功的一种新采煤法，引起了抚顺煤矿工人们的重视。早在去年12月底，在老虎台矿工会召开的一次座谈会上，庞观祥发言说：以前我们要多出煤，但是许多落后过时的规程制度却限制着我们的手脚。今年我们班虽然提前58天完成了国家计划，但是我总觉得劲头才用出一半。依我看，要多出煤，提前完成五年计划，首先就得把那些妨碍提高产量的陈旧规程和标准改动一下。当时，庞观祥提出加大采高和进一步实行深打眼、放大炮的办法，并且提出了改革支柱方法来保证这样采煤的安全。庞观祥的这个建议，特别引起了技术员周广瑞的注意。在这之前，周广瑞曾经不止一次地考虑过这个问题，并且把它和加多采煤掌子面、工种专业采煤流水作业联系起来考虑过。因此，他积极支持了庞观祥的意见，并且提出了科学的根据。这个座谈会开得很好。最后，会议主席建议由周广瑞把庞观祥的建议加以整理，作出科学合理的方案。
    周广瑞研究了好多个晚上以后，就去找区长马振沪和党支部书记牛庆业商量。他们支持这个创造，并且建议马上征求矿工们的意见。消息传到老虎台矿党委会，要在当天下午讨论的另一个议题被推迟了。委员们以极大的热情听取了周广瑞的汇报，大家对这个可贵创举一致赞同。会议主持者党委副书记尹加胜觉察到在这个创举后面潜藏着巨大的力量，同时也看到了事情的另一方面。他说：一个新东西的生长必然会遇到困难。果然，矿工们正在热烈讨论这个新方法的时候，抚顺矿务局来了两位技术员。一位江技术员听说空顶距离要超过常规达到5.6公尺，十分不满；尽管人们向他解释了采取的措施，他还是不同意这种做法。在这个方案中，改革最大的地方是一次开帮40公尺，当然也就遭到了反对。但是，新事物的创造者和组织者并没有被这些吓住。老虎台矿的总工程师周永发和周广瑞，一起到抚顺矿务局去请示。在矿务局总工程师办公室，新生事物又遇到了一次考验。周广瑞在会上审慎地答辩着被质询的各种问题。采高的争辩刚刚平息，那位江技术员又说：“你这样的放炮方法要崩翻棚子呀！”紧跟着又有人问：“要崩翻棚子怎么办？”这时，周广瑞也很激动，他说：“眼的角度是直的，这样爆破的力量是上下扩散，不能崩翻棚子，我可以写一份保证书。”于是会场沉默。不一会，一个技术员又提出了新问题：“每个眼1.1公尺的距离，不合乎计算公式的要求，这样抵抗线大了，就要崩不开。”周广瑞说：“这是工人的宝贵意见。我也用你说的公式算过，也算不通，可是工人在现场就用这样的距离打开了。我们看问题不应该太死板！”经过一个上午的争辩，总算冲过了几层障碍，最后大家都等待着抚顺矿区国家技术安全监察局的代表发表意见。这位代表没有表示意见，他只是说回去研究研究。副矿长王振海怕这件事被拖下来，就站起来说：“一个新的东西，你再考虑得周到，也不会十全十美的。要尽量事前考虑得周到是完全必要的，但是也不要前怕狼，后怕虎！”由于王振海的坚持，当天下午就开始研究两人的创议。这时候，老虎台矿领导人员鼓励周广瑞要大胆和保守主义思想进行斗争。从下午争论到晚上，庞观祥、周广瑞的创议得到了中共抚顺矿区委员会的支持，冲破了陈规旧律，批准老虎台矿试验新采煤法。
    当试验的第一天，矿工们创造了新纪录的时候，已经接近午夜了。矿工们浸着汗水的单衣沾满煤尘，每一个黝黑的面孔上都显露着满心的欢喜。坐守在调度电话机旁的老区长马振清像欢迎凯旋战士那样高兴地欢迎了周广瑞和庞观祥。
