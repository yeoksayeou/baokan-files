    Don't Throw Broken Glass and Other Items in the Toilet
    Editor:
    Last year, Yang Liangwen, a poor peasant in our village, was injured in the foot by a piece of glass while working in the field. The wound later became infected and he had to have surgery at the county People's Hospital and rest for more than a month before recovering. Wang Jianjun, a poor peasant in a neighboring village, also cut his foot on a piece of scrap iron while working in the field, and had to rest for more than ten days before he could return to work.
    These shards of glass and pieces of scrap iron are brought from the feces of various agencies in the city. Therefore, I hope that urban residents and employees will not throw shards of glass, broken pieces of bowls, and pieces of iron into the toilet, so as to avoid accidents when farmers use urban feces in the fields.

### 不要把碎玻璃等丢在厕所里

    不要把碎玻璃等丢在厕所里
    编辑同志：
    去年，我村贫农阳梁文在田里干活的时候，被一块玻璃片刺伤了脚，后来伤口化了脓，到县人民医院开刀治疗，歇了一个多月才好。邻村贫农王见君，在田里生产的时候，也被一块废铁片划伤了脚，歇了十多天才能下地生产。
    这些碎玻璃片和废铁片，都是从城里各机关的粪便中带来的。因此，我希望城市居民和职工同志，不要把碎玻璃片、碎碗片和铁片等丢在厕所里，以免农民使用城市粪便下地时发生意外。
