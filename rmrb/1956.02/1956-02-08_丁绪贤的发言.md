Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
I have listened to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of the socialist revolution, and the reports of the various leaders. I express my complete support and agreement.

I am a 71-year-old intellectual, a university teacher, and a scientific worker. The recent high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the high tide of the transformation of industry and commerce, and even the high tide of culture, have turned the socialist vision into a near-term reality. The prospect of our country's science catching up with the world's highest level in just 12 years fills me with immense excitement.

I am a person who came from the old society, and the toxins of the old society have had a profound impact on me. I feel that I am very inadequate in both my professional work and my political studies. In the future, I must work hard to study and study again, live and learn, which is my outlook on life. Some people have said to me: "It is rare for people to live to seventy in ancient times. You are now over seventy years old, why not retire in time? You meet the conditions for retirement." My answer is: "It is common for people to live to seventy these days. Moreover, I am already over seventy years old, and there is nothing to spare in dedicating my remaining years entirely to the Party and the country, to socialism."

Therefore, although I am old and weak, I am still willing to obey the needs of the Party and the country, respond to the call of the times, and hope to play a small role.

Training cadres and new forces must be done with quantity, speed, quality, and economy. This is indeed an urgent, arduous, and glorious task. After the teaching reform, I have seen that many of the younger generation have made rapid progress. I must not only learn from my peers, but also willingly learn from young colleagues, from Party and League members, and from model workers in some areas.

To catch up with the world's scientific level in 12 years, in addition to learning from the Soviet Union and utilizing the advanced experiences of various countries, we must introduce as much as possible to foreign countries all the positive and creative scientific and other achievements, large and small, of our ancient and modern times, and constantly promote and develop them, and exchange experiences.

Scientific research work, if it can lead to major inventions or discoveries, is naturally a creative contribution. However, this can only be done by a few great scientists with some talent. For most researchers, if they can improve or simplify any theory, experiment, method, or technology in their field of research, it is also a form of creation. Accumulating everyone's small improvements can develop into a large improvement and creation.

As for criticism and self-criticism, it is not only a weapon in political study, but also very necessary in academic work. Intellectuals are often too polite. In this regard, we have not done enough in the past. In the future, well-intentioned criticisms aimed at curing diseases and saving people must be carried out frequently. Only in this way can we truly help others and improve each other.

There is also the problem of intellectuals, which is the problem of students studying abroad.

In his political report, Chairman Zhou Enlai spoke about the issue of civilians returning home from both China and the United States, saying: "The US government forces Chinese nationals to apply as 'political refugees,' apply for 'permanent residence' in the United States, and even stipulates that they must obtain 'Taiwan entry permits,' attempting to deprive them of their right to return home." However, the US side does not admit the fact that it is unreasonably obstructing students from returning home. Please allow me to say a few words on this matter.

As early as the beginning of China's liberation, the United States had already prohibited students studying science and engineering from returning home, otherwise they would be sentenced to up to 5 years imprisonment or a fine of up to US$5,000, or both. Until recently, we have seen reports in the newspapers one after another of parents demanding the return of their children from the American imperialists, children demanding the return of their fathers from the American imperialists, and wives demanding the return of their loved ones from the American imperialists.

It is obvious that these students studying abroad are being obstructed, threatened, or persecuted, and at least they are not getting the freedom to apply to return home. It should be stated that there are still no fewer than several thousand students studying in the United States who are unable to return home. These students are high-level intellectuals who have been cultivated by the motherland for many years and are talents needed for our country's construction. How can we not try every means to enable them to return to the embrace of the motherland in time?

Let us intellectuals unite around the Chinese Communist Party and our wise leader Chairman Mao, and strive together under the banner of building socialism!

    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听了周恩来主席的政治报告，郭沫若副主席关于在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告和各首长的报告，表示完全拥护和同意。
    我是一个71岁的知识分子，是个大学教师，也是个科学工作者。最近农业合作化高潮，工商业改造高潮，乃至文化高潮的到来，使社会主义远景变作近景，祖国科学将在短短12年赶上世界最高水平，这对我来说，是感到万分兴奋的。
    我是从旧社会过来的人，旧社会的毒素对于我的影响实在太深了，我在业务方面和政治学习方面都感觉得太不够了，今后我要努力学习再学习，活到老，学到老，就是我的人生观。有人对我说：人生七十古来稀，你现在已七十多岁了，何不及时退休，你是具备退休条件的。我的回答是：人生七十近来多，况且我已经七十多岁，能把有生余年完全贡献给党国，贡献给社会主义还有什么值得吝惜之余地呢。
    所以我虽年迈力衰，仍愿服从党国的需要，响应时代的召唤，希望能起点滴作用。
    培养干部和新生力量，必须又多又快又好又省，这实在是当前迫切的艰巨而光荣的任务。教学改革后，我看到许多青年一代进步很快。我不但要向同辈学习，有些地方还情愿向青年同事学习，向党团员学习，向劳动模范学习。
    要在12年内赶上世界科学水平，除学习苏联，并利用各国先进经验外，我们必须将我国古代和近代所有的大大小小具有积极性创造性的科学及其他方面的成就，尽量地多多地向国外介绍，并随时发扬光大，交流经验。
    科学研究工作，如要能有大发明或大发现，自然是富有创造性的贡献。不过这是稍有天才的大科学家才能办到的，毕竟是少数。就做研究工作者多数的人来讲，在自己所研究的某一部门中，如果能将任何理论、实验或方法、技术加以改进或简化，也未尝不是一种创造。把每个人的小小改进累积起来，就可发展成一个大的改进创造了。
    至于批评与自我批评，不但在政治学习上是一种武器，在学术业务上也十分需要。而知识分子，经常总是过于客气。在这方面，过去做得不够。今后，我们中间善意地治病救人的批判，必须经常展开才好。这样才能真正帮助旁人，互相提高。
    还有一种知识分子问题，那就是留学生的问题。
    周恩来主席在政治报告中谈起中美双方平民回国问题说：美国政府迫使中国侨民申请作为“政治难民”，申请在美国“永远居留”，甚至规定他们必须取得“台湾入境证”，企图剥夺他们回国的权利。而美国方面却不承认无理阻挠留学生回国的事实。请让我在这方面讲几句话。
    早在中国解放初年，美国已不准习理工等科的留学生回国，否则要判以5年以下监禁或美金5，000元以下罚款，或二者并用。直到最近，我们还都看到报上接二连三发表的，有父母向美帝索回子女的，有孩子们向美帝索回爸爸的，也有妻子向美帝索回爱人的。
    很明显，这些留学生，是受到阻挠、威胁或迫害，至少得不到申请回国的自由，应当申明，留美学生目前不得回国者，尚不下数千人，这些留学生都是祖国培养多年的高级知识分子，正是我国建设所需要的人才，怎能不想尽方法，使他们及时回到祖国怀抱中来呢？
    让我们知识分子团结在中国共产党和我们的英明领导者毛主席的周围，在建设社会主义事业的旗帜下共同奋斗吧！
