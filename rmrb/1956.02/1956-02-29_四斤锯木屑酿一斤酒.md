    Four Jin of Sawdust Brews One Jin of Wine
    Workers at the Fuxin City Distillery have developed a new method of brewing one jin of wine from four jin of sawdust. Brewing wine from sawdust is not complicated. Sawdust contains cellulose. After adding sulfuric acid and water to boil it, the cellulose is transformed into a glucose liquid. Then, after yeast fermentation and distillation, white wine flows continuously into the wine barrels. According to recent sample tests by scientific institutions, this wine contains 50 degrees of alcohol, has a mellow taste, and is not harmful to the human body.

    四斤锯木屑酿一斤酒
    阜新市制酒厂的职工研究出用4斤锯木屑酿制1斤酒的新方法。用锯木屑酿制酒并不复杂。锯木屑里含有纤维素，加进硫酸和清水把它烧煮以后，这种纤维素就化成葡萄糖液体；再经过酵母酿造、蒸馏，白色的酒就源源流入酒桶。根据科学机关最近化验样品证明，这种酒含酒量有50度，酒味醇厚，对人的身体没有害处。
