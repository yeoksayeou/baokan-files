Shanghai, February 28th (By our correspondent) The inter-factory competition centered on improving product quality in more than 100 cotton textile and printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai has already achieved preliminary results. So far, the quality of cotton yarn in more than half of the state-owned cotton textile factories and some joint state-private cotton textile factories has reached the new national standard ahead of schedule.

In early February, the cotton yarn quality of the state-owned Shanghai No. 4 and No. 5 Cotton Textile Factories first reached the new standard. Recently, the workers of the state-owned No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory, which reached the new quality standard, put forward 1,065 rationalization proposals and opinions on improving production and improving quality in one week. Workers of the state-owned No. 10 Cotton Textile Factory actively learned from the experience of the No. 4 and No. 5 Cotton Textile Factories, strengthened raw cotton management, mastered the properties of raw cotton, and implemented technical measures in a timely manner, and the product quality quickly reached the new standard. The state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Printing and Dyeing Factory and others also improved the printing and dyeing quality of calico in the competition.

The joint state-private cotton textile factories also actively participated in the competition, striving to catch up with the level of the advanced state-owned factories. After the engineers and technicians of the joint state-private Anda No. 1 Factory learned from the experience of the state-owned No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory, they implemented a series of technical measures, and 30-count cotton yarn, 42-count cone yarn, etc. have now reached the first-class level. The cotton yarn quality of the joint state-private Tongyi, Xinhe and other cotton mills has also improved.
