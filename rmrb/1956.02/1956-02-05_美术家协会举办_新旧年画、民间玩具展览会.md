The Chinese Artists Association has organized an "Exhibition of New and Old New Year Pictures and Folk Toys," which opened today at the Art Exhibition Hall in Shuaifuyuan, Beijing. A total of 478 new and old New Year pictures and folk toys are on display.

The exhibition has four exhibition halls. The first exhibition hall features New Year pictures published in various regions of the country in 1955-1956, many of which are works by young artists. The New Year pictures published this year have generally been well-received by the masses, and the themes and contents reflected are relatively broad. Some works reflect the active labor of workers and peasants and the lives of young people, women, and children in the national socialist construction. The second exhibition hall displays woodcut New Year pictures published in revolutionary base areas during the Liberation War and since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Most of them are works co-created by art workers and folk artists. The third and fourth exhibition halls display folk woodcut New Year pictures, door paintings, and Spring Festival decorations from the early Qing Dynasty to around the 1911 Revolution, mainly from the three major New Year picture production areas in China: Taohuawu (Suzhou), Yangliuqing (Tianjin), and Weixian (Shandong), as well as some products from Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan, and other places.

The exhibition displays more than 100 folk toys, all with strong local characteristics and decorative interests.

Although the new and old New Year pictures and toys collected for this exhibition are not comprehensive enough, the traditional characteristics of Chinese folk New Year pictures and toys can be seen from these exhibits.

    中国美术家协会举办了一个“新旧年画、民间玩具展览会”，今天在北京帅府园美术展览馆开幕，展出新旧年画和民间玩具共478件。
    展览会共有四个展览室，第一展览室是1955—1956年全国各地区出版的新年画，其中有不少是青年画家的作品，这一年来出版的年画，大体上还是受到群众欢迎的，所反映的题材内容也比较广泛，部分作品反映了全国社会主义建设中工人农民的积极劳动和青年、妇女、儿童们的生活。第二展览室陈列的是解放战争时期革命根据地出版的和中华人民共和国成立以来所出版的木板年画，它们大多是美术工作者和民间艺人合作的作品。第三、四展览室陈列的是从清初到辛亥革命前后的民间木板年画、门画和春节装饰画，以我国民间年画主要出产地区桃花坞（苏州）、杨柳青（天津）和潍县（山东）三地的产品为主，也有广东、福建、四川等地的部分产品。
    展览会陈列的民间玩具100多件，都有着浓厚的地方色彩和装饰趣味。
    这次展览会所搜集的新、旧年画和玩具，虽然还不够广泛，但从这些展品中也可以看出我国民间年画和玩具的传统特点。
