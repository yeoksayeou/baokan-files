Building More and Better Railways

With the rapid development of China's national economy, railway construction has also achieved great success.

From 6 years between 1950 and 1955, China built nearly 4,000 kilometers of new railways, repaired more than 1,200 kilometers of railways, and built and repaired more than 1,100 kilometers of double tracks, a total of more than 6,300 kilometers. By the end of 1955, the total mileage of railways open to traffic in China had increased by more than 20% compared with 1950.

Before the start of China's first Five-Year Plan, in order to cooperate with the huge recovery of the national economy and ensure the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, we built the important railway trunk lines from Chongqing to Chengdu, Laibin to Munanguan, and Tianshui to Lanzhou, and repaired the railway from Baoji to Tianshui. This promoted the economic development of Northwest and Southwest China. At the same time, an international transportation line to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was also built.

According to the provisions of the country's first Five-Year Plan, a total of 19 new railways have been started successively in the past 3 years. These include: the Jining to Erlian railway to the People's Republic of Mongolia, which is more than 330 kilometers long. This railway started handling international through transport for China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union on January 1 this year. This trunk line shortens the train journey between Beijing and Moscow by more than 1,100 kilometers compared with the past; the Fengtai to Shacheng railway, which is more than 100 kilometers long, was officially put into operation on November 1, 1955, greatly increasing the transport capacity of the Jingbao Line; the Litang to Zhanjiang railway, which is more than 310 kilometers long, was built by the heroic railway soldiers, who completed the construction task in just 8 months, 6 months ahead of schedule; the Lancun to Yantai railway, which is more than 180 kilometers long, has also been completed and officially opened to traffic on January 1, 1956; the Baoji to Chengdu railway, which leads to the hinterland of Southwest China, had its track laid from Chengdu past Lueyang by the end of 1955, of which the Chengdu to Guangyuan section, which is more than 320 kilometers long, has been officially opened for business; the Qinling Tunnel, with its northern end already having been bored for more than 2,300 meters; the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the fourth international trunk line traversing Northwest China and leading to the Soviet Union, was originally scheduled to be laid to Zhangye in 1955, but due to the high enthusiasm of railway workers for socialist construction, the actual laying exceeded Zhangye by more than 130 kilometers, of which the Lanzhou to Wuwei section has been officially put into operation; the Baotou to Lanzhou railway, which connects the two major industrial bases in Northwest China, the second railway connecting the interior and exterior of China – the Beijing to Chengde railway, as well as railways extending to the southwest hinterland and the southeast coast, are all under construction. In addition, in order to cooperate with the establishment of new industrial bases, industrial branch lines in Baotou, Wuchang, Xi'an and other regions, as well as railways extending into several primitive forests such as the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and Changbai Mountain, have been built and are being built.

The construction project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which connects the two major trunk lines of Jinghan and Yuehan, is progressing rapidly under the guidance of excellent Soviet bridge experts. Chinese bridge engineers and bridge workers have solved the most complex and difficult technical problems of bridge foundations in the project. Now the project is progressing rapidly, and all eight piers in the center of the river have been fully started. It is expected to open to traffic ahead of schedule in 1957.

From 1953 to 1955, more than 2,600 kilometers of new railways were built, reaching about 65% of the task stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. During the construction process, thanks to the help of Soviet experts and the railway workers' high patriotism, the difficulties of cold, wind, sand, deserts, high mountains, and the Yangtze River were overcome. Many advanced working methods were created, which gradually accelerated the progress of the project and created favorable conditions for future railway construction.

In order to build more railways, in terms of design, we are currently preparing to use aerial surveying more extensively, widely adopt standardized designs and reuse drawings, simplify the design procedures and the compilation methods of design budgets, as well as the procedures for contracting, acceptance, and valuation, so as to enhance design capabilities. In terms of construction, we are vigorously promoting advanced working methods of various types of work, and adopting Soviet large-scale blasting construction methods in difficult areas as much as possible to speed up the construction progress. At the same time, we are widely adopting factory-based and specialized construction methods, and using more mechanized construction in sparsely populated areas to reduce costs and speed up the progress.

After taking the above measures, it is not only possible to complete the construction tasks of new railways stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan faster, more, better, and more economically, but the Ministry of Railways has also recently decided to add several important trunk line construction projects beyond the first Five-Year Plan, such as the Neijiang to Kunming railway, the Chongqing to Guiyang railway, the Guiyang to Duyun railway, the Wuhu to Guixi railway, etc., which will also be started earlier.

The Ji(ning)-Er(lian) railway, with a total length of 337 kilometers, which was stipulated to be built during the first Five-Year Plan, has been completed and opened to traffic. The completion of this railway has greatly shortened the railway mileage between Beijing, Ulaanbaatar and Moscow.

Construction workers along the northern section of the Bao(ji)-Cheng(du) Railway, which was stipulated to be built during the first Five-Year Plan and runs through the Southwest and Northwest, began to use mechanical track laying from February 8 this year to ensure that trains pass through Fengxian on "May Day" this year. A track-laying machine composed of tractors and track-laying frames is hoisting finished tracks in the area near Baoji.

The Bao(tou)-Lan(zhou) Railway, which connects the two major industrial areas of Inner Mongolia and the Northwest, is one of the key railway construction projects in the first Five-Year Plan. This railway is now under active construction. Dozens of bulldozers on the Baolan Railway construction site are working hard even at night.

The Feng(tai)-Sha(cheng) Railway was completed and opened to traffic ahead of schedule on July 1, 1955. After the opening of this railway, the transportation capacity was three times higher than the original line passing through Nankou and Kangzhuang. Coal from Datong, iron from Xuanhua, and food and medicinal materials from Wuyuan Hetao can be continuously transported to all parts of the country. He Yuqiang (photo)

    修筑更多更好的铁路
    随着我国国民经济的迅速发展，铁路的建设工作也取得了很大的成就。
    从1950年到1955年的6年间，我国新建铁路将近4，000公里，修复铁路1，200多公里，新建和修复复线1，100多公里，共计6，300多公里。截至1955年底止，我国铁路的通车里程比1950年增长了20％以上。
    还在我国第一个五年计划开始执行以前，为了配合国民经济的巨大恢复工作，保证城乡物资交流，我们曾经新建了重庆到成都、来宾到睦南关、天水到兰州的重要铁路干线，并修复了宝鸡到天水的铁路。这就促进了我国西北和西南地区的经济发展。同时还建成了通向越南民主共和国的国际交通干线。
    根据国家第一个五年计划的规定，3年来先后动工修建的新铁路共19条。其中包括：通向蒙古人民共和国的集宁至二连铁路330多公里，这条铁路在今年1月1日起开始办理中、蒙、苏三国国际联运，通过这条干线，使北京和莫斯科之间的火车行程比过去缩短了1，100多公里；丰台到沙城铁路100多公里，已经在1955年11月1日正式交付营业，并使京包线的运输能力大大增加；由英勇的铁道兵修建的黎塘至湛江铁路310多公里，在短短8个月的时间里就完成了修建任务，比计划提前了6个月；蓝村至烟台铁路180多公里，也已修建完成，并在1956年1月1日正式通车；通向我国西南腹地的宝鸡至成都铁路，到1955年底，轨道已从成都铺过了略阳，其中成都至广元段320多公里，已正式开办了营业；北端已经打通了2，300多公尺的秦岭大隧道；横贯我国西北地区通向苏联的第四条国际干线——兰新铁路，1955年原定铺轨到张掖，由于铁路职工们的社会主义建设热情的高涨，实际铺过了张掖130多公里，其中兰州至武威段已经正式办理营业；联结我国西北两大工业基地的包头至兰州铁路、沟通关内外的第二条铁路——北京至承德铁路，以及伸向西南腹地和东南沿海的铁路都在进行修建。此外为配合新工业基地的建立还修筑了和正在修筑着包头、武昌、西安等地区的工业支线以及伸入大兴安岭、小兴安岭、长白山等若干原始森林的铁路。
    联结京汉、粤汉两大干线的武汉长江大桥的建设工程，在苏联优秀的桥梁专家的指导下，中国的桥梁工程师们和桥梁工人们解决了工程上最复杂艰巨的桥梁基础技术问题。现在工程进展很快，江心中的8个桥墩已经全面动工。预计将提前在1957年内通车。
    从1953年到1955年建成新铁路2，600多公里，达到了五年计划规定任务的65％左右。在修建工程中由于苏联专家的帮助以及铁路职工发挥了高度的爱国主义热情，克服了寒冷、风砂、沙漠、崇山峻岭以及长江大河等等自然条件的困难，创造了很多先进工作方法，使工程进度逐步加快，同时为以后修建铁路创造了有利的条件。
    为了修筑更多的铁路，在设计方面，目前正准备更多地采用航空测量，广泛采用定型设计和重复使用图纸，简化设计的程序和设计预算的编制方法，以及发包验收计价的手续等，以便增强设计能力。在施工方面，正大力推广各工种的先进工作方法，在困难地区尽可能采用苏联的大爆破施工方法，以加快施工进度，同时广泛采用工厂化、专业化的施工方法，在地广人稀的地方更多地采用机械化施工，以降低造价，加快进度。
    采取以上措施后，不仅有可能更快、更多、更好、更省地完成第一个五年计划规定的新铁路的建设任务，铁道部最近还决定增加第一个五年计划以外的若干重要干线的建设工程，如内江到昆明的铁路，重庆到贵阳的铁路，贵阳到都匀的铁路，芜湖到贵溪的铁路等等，也将提前动工修建。（附图片）
