    Ministry of Food Holds Warehousing Work Conference
    Decides to Vigorously Promote “Four-Free” Granaries

    The Ministry of Food recently held the Fourth National Warehousing Work Conference. The conference determined the principles and tasks of grain warehousing work for 1956 and decided to vigorously promote "Four-Free" granaries—free from insects, free from mold, free from rodents and birds, and free from accidents—nationwide.
    In 1955, thanks to the active efforts of the vast number of grain storage personnel, grain departments in various regions saw a large number of granaries that were free from insects, mold, or rodents and birds. The country also saw 22,461 "Four-Free" granaries, saving the state from losing a large amount of grain. After affirming these achievements and criticizing right-leaning conservative thoughts in warehousing work, the conference requested that grain warehousing departments in various regions, under the overall planning for eliminating "four pests," actively adopt various possible and effective measures according to different regions, seasons, and other conditions, vigorously eliminate insect, rodent, and bird pests, eliminate accidents, and strive to create more, better, and more economical granaries that are free from insects, mold, rodents and birds, and accidents.
    The conference also discussed the long-term plan for grain warehousing work, determined to implement management standardization and granary mechanization in a planned and step-by-step manner, and to strive to improve the professional and technical level of all employees.

    粮食部召开仓储工作会议
    决定大力推广“四无”粮仓
    粮食部最近召开了全国第四次仓储工作会议。会议确定了1956年粮食仓储工作的方针和任务，决定在全国范围内大力推广无虫、无霉、无鼠雀、无事故的“四无”粮仓。
    1955年内，由于广大粮食保管人员的积极努力，各地粮食部门出现了大批无虫、无霉或无鼠雀等的粮仓，全国还出现了“四无”粮仓22，461个，使国家有大批粮食避免遭受损失。这次会议在肯定了这些成绩，批判了仓储工作中的右倾保守思想以后，要求各地粮食仓储部门在各地除“四害”的总规划下，根据不同地区，季节等条件，积极采取各种可能而有效的措施，大力扑灭虫、鼠、雀害，消灭事故，努力创造更多、更好、更省的无虫、无霉、无鼠雀和无事故的粮仓。
    这次会议还讨论了粮食仓储工作的远景规划，确定要有计划有步骤地实行管理制度化和粮仓机械化，并且要努力提高所有职工的业务技术水平。
