Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th - The International Democratic Women's Federation, in anticipation of International Women's Day on March 8, 1956, has issued an appeal to women worldwide. The appeal states: March 8 is a day of struggle, friendship, understanding, and the expression of new resolve; it also marks the 10th anniversary of the founding of the International Democratic Women's Federation.

    国际民主妇联发表告全世界妇女书
    据新华社柏林19日电　国际民主妇女联合会为了迎接1956年3月8日国际妇女节，发表了告全世界妇女书。告全世界妇女书说：3月8日是一个斗争、友谊、谅解和表现新的决心的日子，同时也是庆祝国际民主妇联成立10周年的日子。在这10年中，妇女的生活起了深刻的转变。千千万万妇女参加了争取她们的经济、政治和社会权利以及争取和平的斗争。
    由于确信世界妇女团结的意志能够在使1956年成为和平事业和在促进各地妇女、儿童的幸福方面取得显著成就的一年里起着极为重要的作用，国际民主妇联号召各国妇女把3月8日作为表现团结一致的决心的日子：要求就导向切实可行的裁军措施达成协议；要求就禁止使用和试验核子武器达成协议；要求通过和平协商来解决各国间的悬而未决的分歧，以及努力为所有的妇女争取在和平的世界中作为母亲、工人和公民的充分权利，使世界各地妇女和儿童能够享受丰富的生活。
