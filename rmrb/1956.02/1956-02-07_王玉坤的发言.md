Wang Yukun's Speech

I am Wang Yukun, the director of the Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaopang, and Wang Xiaoqi three-poor-peasant cooperative in Nanwangzhuang Village, Anping County, Hebei Province. My name is Wang Yukun, and I come from a background of doing manual labor. Attending this conference and listening to Premier Zhou's report made me extremely happy. The spirit of the report greatly encouraged me, filling me with energy. I fully support this report and will implement the spirit of the conference in practical actions after returning to the village.

Today, I want to talk about how we formed the three-poor-peasant cooperative. Initially, in the autumn of 1954, a cooperative was established in the village. I split off from a six-household cooperative, which consisted of three middle-peasant households and three poor-peasant households. The three middle-peasant households had all the livestock and farm tools, and they were afraid of being taken advantage of by the poor, so they resolutely didn't want to continue. Despite sincere and well-meaning persuasion, they insisted on withdrawing. Since we couldn't keep them, we parted ways amicably. We told them that if they couldn't see things clearly today but came to their senses tomorrow, they were welcome to return. After settling the accounts, they left. They took away two of the three livestock, leaving us with one old cow. The production tools were even more lacking. But difficulties couldn't scare us. We thought, we had nothing in the past, as long as we have a firm heart and two working hands, we are not afraid of any difficulties. After the three households withdrew, Wang Xiaopang's family among our three households had difficulties in life, so we provided mutual aid. I took out 30 yuan from my cotton sales to solve Wang Xiaopang's living difficulties. The three of us became tightly bound together, and we worked hard. When summer arrived, the busy season of harvesting and planting, a lot of difficulties were presented to our three-poor-peasant cooperative, for example, in May, the wheat was cut down and lying on the ground without a cart to transport it; the cut willow branches (a kind of tool material branches and茅枝, *translator note, this is unclear in original*), without livestock to transport; vegetable garden fertilizer had no way to send, what to do with this series of things? We relied on our shoulders to carry, poles to carry, and carts to push, and we completed all the work. When it came time to hoe the autumn seedlings, because of the heavy rain and many weeds, we hoed 40 mu of seedlings in a row for several mornings without resting at noon, ensuring that no land was left uncultivated. Not only these production difficulties, but also the ridicule and attacks from people. We were clearly a small cooperative of three households, but people called us "Big Cooperative Director, Big Cooperative Shorty"; when you went to the field, as you walked in front, they would say behind you: Look, the big cooperative production team is going to the field again! The county gave us a loan to buy a cart, and they sneered and said: Look, the "big cooperative" bought a horse-drawn cart, etc. In such a cold, sarcastic, and difficult environment, our three households were as united as steel, unwavering, firmly believing that: the road led by Chairman Mao has been successful in the past, and will surely succeed today, and we must not break up when we encounter difficulties, otherwise, not only will we not be able to reach socialism, but we will also become a capitalist society. History has made a summary. Our three men and one cow fought heroically, and in the end we surpassed them: from the perspective of yield, our three small cooperatives had a yield per mu of: millet 210 jin, corn 220 jin, cotton more than 200 jin, reaching the highest level in the village. However, the three households that withdrew, because they worked individually and each managed their own affairs, left the land uncultivated. For example, Wang Luohe, who withdrew from the cooperative, had about 110 jin of millet per mu, 140 jin of cotton, and corn plus beans only totaled 120 jin, which was much lower than the average level of the village. When production improved and income increased, people outside the cooperative wanted to join, and the three middle-peasant households that withdrew realized that the road of individual farming was not working, and eventually returned to cooperate with us. At this time, Chairman Mao praised us and said: "The direction represented by the three poor peasants is the direction of 500 million peasants in the country...." Our determination became even greater, so we opened our doors to develop greatly, warmly welcoming them to cooperate in production, and in about 20 days, all 294 households in the village signed up to join the cooperative. Then, we discussed Chairman Mao's 17 articles on production measures, and in order to tap the potential for production, at the active request of the masses, we have now transformed into a fully socialist cooperative with all the farmers in the village participating. This year, our planned yield per mu is: corn 600 jin, millet 520 jin, wheat 220 jin, cotton 390 jin, peanuts 520 jin, yam 6,000 jin. In order to achieve the targets: First, we will build water conservancy projects, dig wells, and buy waterwheels, expanding the current 414 mu of irrigated land to 3,700 mu; Second, we will accumulate more fertilizer, applying 15,000 jin of fertilizer per mu; Third, we will promote new technologies and learn new experiences, and we must do a good job in production and produce more grain to support the country's industrial construction. At the same time, we will actively create conditions and plan to establish a large-scale cooperative for the entire township based on the needs of production.

This is the process of struggle of our three-poor-peasant cooperative from victory to victory. We will never be complacent because of our achievements, nor will we be proud of being praised by Chairman Mao. We clearly know that the achievements are due to the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the help of the government and comrades, and the support of the masses. At the same time, this is not the success of the revolution. In the future, under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, according to the 40 articles of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, we will unite all the members and work even harder to complete the socialist construction cause.

    王玉坤的发言
    我是河北省安平县南王庄村王玉坤、王小庞和王小其3户贫农合作社的主任。我名叫王玉坤，是个扛长活的出身，参加这个大会，听了周总理的报告，我心里高兴极了，报告精神对我有很大的鼓励，使我满身都成了劲。我完全拥护这个报告，回村后还要把会议精神贯彻到实际行动中去。
    今天我要谈一谈，我们是怎样成了3户贫农合作社的。起初在1954年秋天，村里建了社，我是从中分出的一个6户的合作社，3户中农3户贫农。人家3户中农牲口农具都全有，怕吃穷人的亏，坚决不想再干下去，经去好心善意的劝说，他们还是非退社不可，既然留不下，那咱们就好合好散吧。你们今天想不通而去，明天想通了欢迎你们再来，清了清账，让他们走了。一共3头牲口，带去了两头，给我们留下了1头老牛，生产的工具更是少这没那。可是困难吓不倒我们，我们想，咱过去也是啥也都没有，只要有个坚决的心，和两只劳动的手，任何艰难也不怕。那3户退出后，我们3户中的王小庞家中生活困难，进行了互济，从我家中拿出了30元卖棉花钱，解决了王小庞的生活困难。俺这3户就相互捆的紧紧的，就好好干吧。夏天到了，又收又种的农忙季节，给我们3户贫农社的面前摆出了一大堆困难，例如5月间麦子割倒在地没车拉；砍下的柳杆子枝（是一种工具原料杆的茅枝），没牲口运；菜地肥料没法送，这一串子事怎么办哩？我们就凭着肩膀背，担子挑，小车子推，把全部活也都做出来了。到了锄秋苗时，因雨水大，地草多，我们就一连几个上午不歇晌，适时锄出了40亩苗，保证没荒了地。光这生产方面的困难还不算，还遭到了人们的讽刺讥笑与打击。我们明明是个3户的小社，人家却喊我们“大社长，大社短”；你往地里去，前边走，后边就说：你瞧大社生产队又往地里去呀！县里贷款扶持我们买上了大车，就讥笑说：看看“大社”买上马车了，等等。在这样冷嘲热笑、困难重重的环境下，我们3户团结的像块钢一样，毫不动摇，坚定的相信着：毛主席领导的道路，过去都成功了，今天一定能成功，决不能碰到困难就散伙，那样，不但走不到社会主义，还要变成资本主义社会哩。历史作出总结。我们3条汉子1头牛，英勇的进行斗争，最后我们赛过了他们：从产量上看，我们3户小社每亩产量：谷子210斤，玉米220斤，棉花200多斤，达到了全村的最高水平。可是，退出去的3户，因为他们单干各管各而荒了地，如退社的王洛合每亩谷子约百十斤，棉花140斤，玉米加豆子才合120斤，大大低于全村的水平。生产搞好了，收入增加了，社外的人们要入社，退出的3户中农，自发的路走不通了，终久又回来同我们合作。正在这时，毛主席表扬了我们说：“3户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国5亿农民的方向。……。”我们决心更大了，就开起门来大发展，热情的欢迎他们来共同合作闹生产，前后20来天，全村294户报名入了社。接着又讨论了毛主席关于生产措施17条，为挖掘生产潜力，在群众积极要求下，现在已经转成了全村农户加入的完全社会主义的合作社。我们今年每亩产量计划：玉米600斤，谷子520斤，麦子220斤，棉花390斤，花生520斤，山药6，000斤。为实现指标：第一、兴修水利，打机井、买水车，由现在水地414亩扩大到3，700亩；第二、多积肥，每亩施肥15，000斤；第三、推广新技术，学习新经验，一定要搞好生产，多打粮食，支援国家工业建设。同时，积极创造条件，根据生产的需要，计划办成一个全乡规模的大型合作社。
    这就是我们3户贫农合作社由胜利走向胜利的斗争过程。我们决不以有了成绩而自满，受了毛主席表扬而骄傲。我们清楚的知道成绩是党和毛主席正确领导，政府与同志们的帮助，群众的支持才得来的。同时，这还不是革命的成功，我们今后要在党和毛主席的指导下，根据中共中央提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案40条，团结全体社员，更加倍的努力，为完成社会主义建设事业而奋斗。
