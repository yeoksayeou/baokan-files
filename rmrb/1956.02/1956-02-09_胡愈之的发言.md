Comrades, Chairman,
I completely agree with Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of other comrades.

Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo's report on intellectuals, and the speeches of many comrades have all pointed out the fact that our country is undergoing a great socialist economic construction and cultural construction unprecedented in history; we must fundamentally change the backwardness of our country's science and culture in about 12 years and catch up with the advanced level of the world. We are all full of confidence and will resolutely struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to achieve the above goals.

Now, I will make a brief speech to you on the issue of popularizing Mandarin Chinese and drafting a phonetic alphabet scheme.

Language is inseparable from social life. Language is a tool for social communication and a weapon for social struggle. Chinese—the language of the Han people in our country—is the most widely used language in the world and one of the most developed languages ​​in the world. However, due to historical reasons, there are many serious dialectal differences in Chinese, so that people from different regions often cannot communicate freely. In the past, this phenomenon was natural and difficult to change. But today, the continued existence of this phenomenon is intolerable. Nowadays, workers in large factories come from all over the country. Without a common language, collective production work is difficult to carry out. Agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms also need to exchange experiences with distant places from time to time to improve production technology, and also need to invite technical personnel who do not speak the local dialect to help production. If the language is not understood, difficulties will arise. After the implementation of the military service law, our army cannot be organized according to dialect areas. If the conscripted youths from various places do not understand each other's language, how can collective military training be carried out? Our cadres and university graduates may be transferred to work in any region of our motherland according to the needs of the country. Young people cannot stay in their hometowns for the rest of their lives, and may have to work or reclaim land in the most remote areas one day. Workers, soldiers, farmers, cadres, students, and young people all need a common language. This is a requirement of the times and everyone's wish.

This common language of the Han nationality already exists, that is, Mandarin Chinese, which takes Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound, Northern dialect as the basic dialect, and the exemplary modern vernacular literature works as the grammatical norm. Vigorously popularizing this Mandarin Chinese in schools, troops, organs and all aspects of people's lives is an important measure to strengthen the unity and development of the Han nationality's politics, economy, national defense, and culture, and it is an urgent political task to meet the requirements of the people of the whole country and the needs of my country's socialist construction. To this end, the State Council has decided to set up working committees for the promotion of Mandarin Chinese in the central government and various provinces and cities to lead this work, and will issue instructions on the promotion of Mandarin Chinese. The Ministry of Education has decided to start teaching Mandarin Chinese in primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools across the country from the autumn of 1956. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has also issued instructions to the entire army, calling for vigorous promotion of Mandarin Chinese in the army. Soon, a wave of learning Mandarin Chinese will form across the country.

Comrades, we hope everyone will support this work. Everyone should publicize and promote this matter, so that a trend will form in society: everyone is willing to learn Mandarin Chinese. I hope that after you comrades go back, you will encourage your children to study Mandarin Chinese hard. Of course, it is more difficult for older people to learn languages, while the younger generation can learn Mandarin Chinese easily. But for the sake of promotion, we should learn as much as we can. In this way, with everyone enthusiastically promoting Mandarin Chinese, this work can be expected to achieve significant results in a relatively short period of time.

In order to help eliminate illiteracy and help promote Mandarin Chinese, and in order to do these tasks faster, more economically, more and better, many experts from the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee have drafted a draft of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme after a long period of research. This scheme stipulates a set of phonetic alphabets that can be used to annotate Chinese characters, help everyone learn Chinese characters, and can also be used to spell Mandarin Chinese, help everyone learn Mandarin Chinese, and can also be used to write scientific symbols and apply them in telegraphs and other technologies. This scheme is still a draft, and there must be many shortcomings in it. We distributed it to all comrades, requesting criticism and suggestions. We hope that after the closing of this meeting, everyone can organize seminars to discuss this draft. We also want to ask all comrades to take the lead and return to various regions and departments or units to invite more comrades to discuss together and put forward opinions. We hope that everyone will enthusiastically put forward opinions so that the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee can revise it according to everyone's opinions, and then submit it to the government for publication. Comrades, although there are only 30 simple letters in the phonetic alphabet scheme, these 30 letters are closely related to the cultural learning of our people across the country. I believe comrades will be happy to do this meaningful work.

Here, I want to add that the Mandarin Chinese spelled by these phonetic alphabets may become our future phonetic writing system after research and improvement in the next few years. Phonetic writing does have many advantages. Countries or nations that adopt phonetic writing can complete primary school education in 4 years, which we must take 6 years to complete. We now have 50 million primary school students. If each person saves 2 years of study time, wouldn't 50 million people save a lot of time? Phonetic writing has many other advantages, such as being suitable for scientific and technological applications, etc. If we want to make our science and technology catch up with the world's advanced level, we should also make some reforms in the issue of writing.

So, are we going to abolish Chinese characters? No. Don't worry at all. The current phonetic alphabets are not yet phonetic writing. Today we are not attempting to replace Chinese characters with this set of alphabets immediately. Today, what we want to ask everyone to discuss and offer opinions on is just a draft of a phonetic alphabet scheme. We need to study the issue of phonetic writing more thoroughly and with more certainty, and after some of the difficulties have been completely resolved, we can submit the issue of phonetic writing to the comrades for discussion, and it still needs everyone's approval before we can formally adopt phonetic writing. When we switch to phonetic writing in the future, we must try our best to ensure that those who already know Chinese characters will not encounter great difficulties. And even if we switch to phonetic writing in the future, Chinese characters will not disappear. Nor should they disappear. They will always exist and there will always be people who study them and research them.

Therefore, although the phonetic alphabet scheme and phonetic writing are related, they are indeed two different things. Formulating a phonetic alphabet scheme will not harm Chinese characters, but can help teach Chinese characters, annotate Chinese characters, and the quick literacy method is proof of this. Formulating a set of phonetic alphabet schemes is the greatest happiness for children and the illiterate. Moreover, the phonetic alphabet scheme can also help learn Mandarin Chinese, so that the language of the Han people in our country can gradually be unified. For the sake of our children, for the vast masses who are not yet literate or are being literate, and for the unity of the Chinese language, I heartily hope that the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme draft proposed by the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee can get the support of all comrades and the support of people from all walks of life across the country, so that the work of writing reform can take a big step forward, which is beneficial to my country's great socialist construction.

专栏：

    胡愈之的发言
    主席、各位同志：
    我完全同意周恩来主席的政治报告和其他几位同志的报告。
    周恩来主席的政治报告，郭沫若副主席关于知识分子问题的报告，以及很多同志的发言中都指出了这样一个事实，就是我们的国家正在进行着历史上所未有的伟大的社会主义经济建设和文化建设；我们要在12年左右的时间内，根本改变我国科学和文化方面的落后状况，赶上世界的先进水平。我们大家都满怀信心，要在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为实现上述目标而坚决奋斗。
    现在，我就推广普通话和拟制拼音方案的问题向各位作一个简单的发言。
    语言是和社会生活不可分离的。语言是社会交际的工具，也是社会斗争的武器。汉语——我国汉族人民的语言——是世界上使用人数最多的语言，并且是世界上最发达的语言之一。但是由于历史的原因，汉语存在许多严重的方言分歧，以致不同地区的人们往往不能自由交谈。在过去的时代，这种现象原是很自然的，而且也是很难加以改变的。但是在今天，这种现象的继续存在，就是不能容忍的了。现在大工厂的工人是来自各方的，如果没有一种共同的语言，集体的生产工作就难进行。农业生产合作社和集体农庄，为了改进生产技术，也需要时时跟远地交流经验，也要请不通本地方言的技术人员来帮助生产，如果语言不通，就会发生困难。实行兵役法以后，我们的军队不可能按方言地区来编队，如果各地的应征青年，彼此语言不通，那么，怎样来进行集体的军事训练呢？我们的机关干部和大学毕业生，根据国家的需要可能调派到我们祖国的任何一个地区去工作。青年人不可能一辈子老守在本乡本土，说不定有一天要到最边远的地区去工作或开荒。工人、战士、农民、干部、学生、青年，他们都需要一种共同的语言。这是一种时代的要求，人人的愿望。
    汉民族的这种共同的语言已经存在，这就是以北京语音为标准音、以北方话为基础方言，以典范的现代白话语文著作为语法规范的普通话。在学校、部队、机关和人民生活各方面，大力推广这种普通话，是加强汉民族政治、经济、国防、文化的统一和发展的重要措施，是适应全国人民要求和我国社会主义建设需要的迫切的政治任务。国务院为此已经决定在中央和各省市设置推广普通话工作委员会，来领导这个工作，并且将发出关于推广普通话的指示。教育部已经决定从1956年的秋季起，在全国小学、中学和师范学校开始教学普通话。中国人民解放军总政治部也已经向全军发出指示，要在军队中大力推广普通话。不久以后，学习普通话将在全国形成一个热潮。
    同志们，我们希望大家都来支持这个工作。大家都来宣传、提倡这件事情，使得社会上形成一种风气：大家都愿意学习普通话。希望各位同志回去以后，鼓励你们的子女努力学好普通话。当然，我们年纪大一点的学习语言困难比较大，年轻的一代学普通话就很容易。但是为了推广起见，我们能学多少就应该学多少。这样，大家都来热心推广普通话，这件工作就可以希望在一个比较不太长的时期内得到显著的成效。
    为了帮助扫除文盲，为了帮助推广普通话。为了把这些工作做得更快、更省、更多、更好，中国文字改革委员会的好多位专家，经过长时期的研究，拟订了一个汉语拼音方案草案，这个方案规定了一套拼音字母，可以用来给汉字注音，帮助大家学习汉字，又可以用来拼写普通话，帮助大家学习普通话，还可以用来书写科学符号以及在电报和其他技术上应用。这个方案还是一个草案，其中一定还有许多缺点，我们分发给各位同志，请求批评和指教。我们希望在这次会议闭幕以后，大家能够组织座谈，对这个草案加以讨论。我们还要请各位同志带头，回到各个地区和各个部门或单位，邀集更多的同志共同讨论，提出意见。我们希望大家热烈地提出意见，以便中国文字改革委员会根据大家的意见加以修订，然后提请政府公布。同志们，拼音方案里面虽然只有30个简单的字母，可是这30个字母跟我们全国人民的文化学习关系很大。我相信同志们一定会高兴来做好这一件有意义的工作的。
      在这里，我要补充说明一下，这些拼音字母拼写的普通话，在经过今后若干年内的研究和改进以后，可能成为我们未来的拼音文字。拼音文字确实有不少的好处。采用拼音文字的国家或民族，可以在4年中间完成我们必须6年方能完成的小学教育。我们现在有小学生5，000万人，如果每人节省掉2年的学习时间，5，000万人不是节省了很多时间了么？拼音文字还有许多其他的好处，例如，适合于科学和技术上应用等等。我们要想使我们的科学和技术赶上世界先进水平，也就应该在文字问题上来做一番改革。
      那么，是不是就要废除汉字呢？不。完全不用耽心。现在的拼音字母还不是拼音文字。今天我们并不企图用这套字母马上就代替汉字。今天我们要请大家讨论并提意见的还只是一个拼音方案草案。我们要把拼音文字的问题研究得更透彻，更有把握，其中的一些困难得到完满解决以后，我们才能把拼音文字的问题提请同志们讨论，也仍旧要同志们大家赞同以后，才能正式采用拼音文字。在将来改用拼音文字的时候，必须尽量使得已认识汉字的人不致发生很大困难。而且即使将来我们改用拼音文字，汉字仍然不会消灭。也不应该消灭，它将永远存在下去，永远有人学习它，研究它。
    因此，拼音方案同拼音文字虽然有关系，但是确实是两回事情。制定一个拼音方案并不能危害汉字，反而能够帮助教学汉字，给汉字注音，速成识字法就是一个证明。制定一套拼音方案，对于儿童和文盲，更是一种最大的幸福。而且拼音方案还能帮助学习普通话，使我国汉族人民的语言能够逐渐统一。为了我们的孩子，为了尚未识字或正在识字的广大群众，为了汉语的统一，我热烈地希望中国文字改革委员会提出的汉语拼音方案草案能够得到各位同志的支持。得到全国各界人士的支持，好让文字改革工作向前大大跨进一步，对于我国伟大的社会主义建设是有好处的。
