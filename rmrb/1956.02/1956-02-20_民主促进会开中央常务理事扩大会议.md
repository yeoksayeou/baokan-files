Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: The China Association for Promoting Democracy held an expanded meeting of its Central Standing Committee in Beijing from the 9th to the 16th.

The meeting unanimously agreed with the basic spirit of Vice Chairman Zhou Jianren's speech on the future work of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, determining that "everything is for socialism, and contributing more and better to serving socialism" is the fundamental task of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. Under the new situation of the current upsurge of the socialist revolution, it is necessary to strengthen leadership, improve work, and overcome the situation where leadership lags behind the masses and work lags behind reality. It is necessary to wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China, promote members to fully exert their socialist enthusiasm, and do a good job in their posts; to encourage and help members continue to carry out self-education and self-transformation through the three interconnected paths of observing and practicing social life, practicing their professions, and studying Marxist-Leninist theory, and gradually transform themselves into intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve socialism; to regularly and deeply understand and help solve the problems existing among intellectuals, to closely connect with the masses, and to focus on working with those who are progress-seeking but politically slow to develop; to enrich organizational life, help members develop criticism and self-criticism, and continuously improve; and to vigorously cultivate backbones and actively do a good job in developing the organization.

During the meeting, participants listened to a report by Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi on the current situation and the issue of intellectuals. Participants also exchanged experiences in ideological remolding of intellectuals and practical work experience of local organizations. All participants also attended a reception held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. Participants also went to the countryside to have a get-together with farmers. At the end of the meeting, the participants unanimously adopted a resolution on supporting and implementing the spirit of the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a telegram of salute to Chairman Mao Zedong.
