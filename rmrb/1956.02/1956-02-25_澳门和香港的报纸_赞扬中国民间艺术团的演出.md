Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, February 24th: Macau and Hong Kong newspapers praised the performance of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe in Macau.

    Macau's "Va Kio Daily News" published an article on the 16th entitled "Flowers of Motherland's Art Bloom in Macau," stating: All those who have seen the art troupe's performances feel that our great motherland's rich artistic heritage has been wiped clean of dust and is radiating with immense brilliance. People will find it hard to forget the vivid performance of the Lion Dance. Every subtle movement of the lion jumping up and down, scratching its head, and licking its paws, shines with the light of the wisdom and creation of the millions of working people of our great motherland over thousands of years. The article said: The Lotus Dance has captivated the hearts of those who have seen it. This dance makes people feel the peak of a peaceful and happy life. The article concluded: Through the outstanding performances of the art troupe, our relatives, we have gained a further understanding of the glorious achievements of the motherland's culture and art in recent years, and we have been filled with a feeling of pride in having such a great motherland. This is the greatest happiness of the compatriots in Macau.
    In recent days, many compatriots in Hong Kong have also taken ships to Macau to watch the artistic performances of the motherland. Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" published a post-performance impression on the 22nd written by 25 Cantonese film workers, saying that all the performances of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe are so exquisite that, through their performances, we have seen how the people of the motherland are living such touching and happy lives today.
