To the Editor:

In some areas of Hubei Province, the Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative have been engaging in the practice of degrading and depressing prices during cotton procurement, which seriously harms the interests of farmers. For example, out of the 1,773 dan of cotton shipped from Jianli County to Hankou in four batches, the Hubei Provincial Inspection Bureau found that 95% of the cotton had its grade and length undervalued at the time of purchase. The cotton procured by the Liuguan and other warehouses of the Hubei Provincial Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company not only had its grade and length generally undervalued, but also failed to implement the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's measures for water and impurity deductions and subsidies. Of the 408 bales of cotton shipped by the X溝 Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company to Hankou, the provincial inspection bureau found that the length and grade were generally higher than the original inspection results. This phenomenon exists in Hanchuan, Mianyang, Honghu, Daye, and other places.

The main reason for the phenomenon of degrading and depressing prices in cotton procurement is that some procurement personnel of the Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company harbor capitalist business ideas. For example, Deng Chunting, director of the first district cotton receiving station in Jianli County, said: "When I receive cotton from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, even if I know it should be upgraded, I don't allow it. Because if it is upgraded after being sent to Hankou, the company can make money, and I can be praised!" In addition, many cotton collection staff in the Supply and Marketing Cooperative do not understand the technology, so they adopt a "rather tight than loose" approach. This layers of downgrading cause farmers to suffer losses, resulting in a significant reduction in the amount of cotton brought to market.

I believe that the Hubei Provincial Cotton, Yarn & Cloth Company and the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative should educate the procurement personnel of their affiliated institutions to earnestly implement the policy of "better cotton, better price" in cotton procurement.

### 纠正棉花收购工作中的压级压价现象

    纠正棉花收购工作中的压级压价现象编辑同志：
    湖北省某些地区的花纱布公司和供销社，在收购棉花的工作里有压级压价的现象，以致严重地损害了农民的利益。例如，由监利县运往汉口的四批棉花共1，773担，经湖北省检验局检验，发现其中95％的棉花，在收购的时候品级和长度都验低了。湖北省花纱布公司柳关等地仓库所收购的棉花，不但品级和长度普遍压低了，而且对供销社的水杂扣补办法也没有执行。新沟花纱布公司运往汉口的408包棉花，经省检验局检验后，长度和品级也普遍比原来检验的结果上升了。这种现象，在汉川、沔阳、洪湖、大冶等地都有。
    造成收购棉花工作中压级压价现象的原因，主要是花纱布公司某些收购人员有着资本主义经营思想。例如，监利县第一区棉花接收点主任邓春廷说：“我在接收供销社的棉花的时候，明知道是应该升级的，也不让升级。因为如果送到汉口以后升了级，公司能赚钱，我也能受到表扬！”再加上供销社有很多收棉花的工作人员不懂技术，因此就采取“宁紧勿松”的作法。这样层层压级，棉农就吃了亏，因而棉花的上市量也大大减少了。
    我认为：湖北省花纱布公司和湖北省供销合作总社，应该教育所属机构的收购人员，在棉花收购工作中，切实贯彻“优棉优价”的政策。
