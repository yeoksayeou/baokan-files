    法国人民还在这一天在凡尔登举行了“裁军和和平日”，这是按照东部各省和平委员会的号召，在法国全国和平理事会的支持下举行的。来自全国各地的劳动人民的代表团、许多和平组织的代表以及来自西德、英国、波兰、比利时、捷克斯洛伐克和其他国家的和平战士的代表团在凡尔登中央广场之一举行了群众大会。共和国后备军官和军士联合会主席柏蒂将军、世界和平理事会理事伊莎贝丽·布伦姆、法国全国和平理事会主席团委员雅克·马道尔以及西德代表区斯特等都在会上讲了话。
    大会一致通过决议，表明参加会议的人们为反对新战争危险而斗争的不可动摇的意志。决议说，“我们认为，各国政府能够就裁减军备达成普遍协议。我们特别坚决要求禁止原子武器。”决议斥责伦敦和巴黎协定包含着新战争的危险，并且指出：“关于限制军备和建立集体安全的全欧协议能够促成德国问题的和平解决。”
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：在意大利和平运动的倡议下，意大利全国在2月26日举行了“裁军日”，以宣传世界和平理事会关于普遍裁军的建议。
