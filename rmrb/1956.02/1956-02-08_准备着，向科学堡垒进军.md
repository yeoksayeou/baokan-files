Preparing to March Towards the Bastion of Science
　　By Our Correspondent Jian Yuan
　　“The bugle has sounded,
　　Young friends, advance, advance,
　　To the great march on science!
　　To rescue China's science and culture from backwardness,
　　To approach the world's advanced level within twelve years,
　　This is a glorious and arduous mission.
　　Under the Party's comprehensive planning and strengthened leadership,
　　With the crystallization of advanced Soviet experience,
　　We must strive with the utmost intensity,
　　Towards a bright and splendid future,
　　Advance, advance, advance, advance!!!"
　　This is the poem written by Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, for the "Beijing Municipal Middle School Students' Science and Technology Works Exhibition." The exhibition opened on February 5th at the Hygiene Education Hall in Zhongshan Park, Beijing.
　　The extracurricular scientific research activities of Beijing's middle school students are flourishing. Extracurricular groups have been established in the vast majority of schools. According to incomplete statistics, more than 400 groups of more than 30 different types have been established in the city, with more than 15,000 people participating. This exhibition is the crystallization of their activities.
　　The exhibition displays nearly 700 outstanding works made by students from 75 middle schools. These works vividly show that young students have made great efforts in mathematics, physics, radio, chemistry, biology, geology, geography, aviation models, crafts, etc., and have made remarkable achievements.
　　In the mathematics section, a series of exquisite models attract the audience. The "Solid Geometry Models" made by students of the 65th Middle School alone number as many as 23, all welded from lead wire, and each one is extremely accurate. Among them, a "Regular 20-sided Solid Geometry Model" made by Gu Qiyuan and Shi Zhida, two senior high school students in the third grade, consists of 20 equilateral triangles, each of which is perfectly aligned. Even something so complex and conceptual has been visualized.
　　The electric bell rings. It turns out that the "Electrical Automatic Timekeeper" displayed in the physics section reports the time to the audience every 5 minutes. This was manufactured by Cao Yaru and two other students from the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School. It can accurately and automatically report the time for getting up, going to class, leaving class, and assembling. It reports the regular schedule on weekdays and the holiday schedule on holidays. Their school has been using it for a year. Next to this beautiful machine, there is a "Electrical Automatic Timekeeper Model", which was designed and successfully made by Ao Gang and Yang Boyu, two second-year students of the 8th Middle School, even earlier. When they were in the second grade of junior high school, they wanted to make a machine to replace manual ringing. Later, they finally designed it successfully. Ao Gang said: "If all schools in the country use this machine to replace manual ringing, it will not only be accurate but also save a lot of labor!" The physics section also displays exquisite models of cranes, steam turbines, cameras, small projectors, automatic trains, trams, electric boats, and so on.
　　The young students' talents in radio are also amazing. They can make all kinds of crystal radios, and even the headphones can be made by themselves. The exhibition also displays "Regenerative" radios, "Anatomical" radios, steel wire recorders, and so on. Without explanation, people would mistakenly think that these products came from some radio equipment factory. In fact, they were designed and manufactured by high school students or junior high school children who are still wearing red scarves.
　　Young students are looking forward to the peaceful use of atomic energy. The "Magnesium Atom Structure Model" made by the 2nd Squad of the 4th Detachment of the Young Pioneers of the 14th Girls' Middle School is displayed in the chemistry section. This model, made of wooden balls and iron wire, tells people that the red wooden ball in the center is the nucleus; the yellow, green, and black three-layer iron wire circles around it are different electron layers, and the 12 pink wooden balls distributed in the three layers are electrons. What a light and clear model, very good for teaching aids. "Gas Generator", "Iron Smelting Blast Furnace Model", "Ordinary Match Manufacturing Model", etc., are also displayed here. It is truly "heavy industry" and "light industry".
　　Michurin's theory inspires young students. The five wooden frames in the biology section each contain a white rabbit and a black rabbit, a gray rabbit, a grayer one, and another white rabbit, three small rabbits of different colors. It is five generations of a family of rabbits. After studying Michurin's theory of hybridization, the students of the Biology Group of the 25th Middle School experimented with rabbits and got this result. There are also "Crop Rotation System Model", "Hotbed Model", "Chicken Coop Model", and so on. How much effort did the small biologists and small agronomists put in!
　　In the 22 middle schools in Beijing, more than 700 students participated in the geology group. Under the enthusiastic guidance of more than 60 older brothers and sisters from the Beijing Institute of Geology, they have carried out various interesting activities. They often go to Hongshankou, Babaoshan and other places in the suburbs of Beijing to collect ore, and analyze and test the collected ore. The geology section of the exhibition displays their achievements. On the "Map of Mineral Distribution of the Motherland" made by the Geology Group of the 19th Middle School, more than 10 kinds of minerals that have been known, such as iron, copper, manganese, antimony, and tungsten, are marked in their respective producing areas. The little commentator will tell people loudly: there are still many blank spots in the great northwest of the motherland, waiting for us to explore. There are also many mineral specimens displayed here.
　　In the geography section, you can prominently see the young students' love for the motherland. The large "Map of Taiwan and its Vicinity" made by the Geography Model Group of the 22nd Middle School is bright and beautiful. If anyone asks about the production process of this map, the little commentator will first say: Taiwan is the pearl of the motherland, the treasure island of the motherland, but the Taiwan compatriots are still suffering under the rule of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang; the students made this model to show that we must liberate Taiwan! Many theodolite models and meteorological records of geography groups and meteorology groups are displayed here.
　　Various types of aircraft models are hung and placed in an exhibition room. The "Line-Controlled Speed ​​Model Aircraft" made by Gu Qiyuan, a third-year high school student from the 65th Middle School, is small and flexible, and can fly 112 kilometers per hour. It won the second place in the 1955 Beijing Aviation Model Test Speed ​​Model Aircraft. The young students' love for the motherland's aviation industry can be most concretely explained here.
　　From the exhibition, it can be seen that the young students' determination is: get ready, march towards the bastion of science!

    准备着，向科学堡垒进军
    本报记者　鉴远
    “军号响了，
    年青的朋友们，前进，前进，
    向科学大进军！
    要抢救中国科学文化的落后，
    要在十二年内接近世界的先进水平，
    这是光荣而艰巨的使命。
    在党的全面规划、加强领导下，
    有了苏联先进经验的结晶，
    我们要以最紧张的努力，
    向着光辉灿烂的远景，
    前进，前进，前进，前进！！！”
    这是中国科学院院长郭沫若为“北京市中等学校学生科学技术作品展览会”题的诗。这个展览会2月5日在北京中山公园的卫生教育馆开幕了。
    北京市中等学校学生的课外科学研究活动，正在蓬勃地开展着。在极大部分学校里，都建立了课外小组。据不完全统计，全市共建立了30多种不同性质的小组400多个，有15，000多人参加。这个展览会就是他们活动的结晶。
    展览会里陈列着来自75个中等学校学生亲手做的近700件优秀作品。这些作品生动地表明，年青学生们在数学、物理、无线电、化学、生物、地质、地理、航空模型、工艺等方面，作了很大的努力，并有了卓越的成就。
    数学部分，一系列精致的模型吸引着观众。仅第65中学学生们做的“立体几何模型”就有23件之多，全部用铅丝焊接而成，每一件都极为准确。其中高中三年级学生古启元和师志达两人做的一个“正20面体立体几何模型”，由20个正三角形组成，一个个相等的三角形密合得十分好。这样复杂而概念化的东西，竟也把它形象化了。
    电铃响起来。原来是陈列在物理部分的“电气自动报时机”每隔5分钟向观众报时一次。这是北京机器制造学校学生曹雅儒等三人制造的。它可以准确地自动报起床、上课、下课、集合等时间，平常报平常的作息时间，放假日就照放假日的规定报。他们学校使用它已经一年了。在这架漂亮的机器旁边，陈列着一架“电气自动报时机模型”，那是第8中学高中二年级学生敖罡和杨伯禹在更早的时间就设计成功的。他俩还在初中二年级时就想望着做一架机器代替人工打铃。后来终于设计成功。敖罡说：“如果全国学校都用这个机器代替人工打铃，不仅准确，而且可以省下许多劳动力啊！”在物理部分，还陈列着精巧的起重机、汽轮机、照像机、小型幻灯机、自动火车、电车、电动汽艇等等模型。
    年青学生们在无线电方面的才能，也令人感到惊异。他们能做各式各样矿石收音机，连耳机也能自己做。展览会上还陈列着“再生式”收音机、“解剖式”收音机、钢丝录音机等等。要不加以说明，人们会误认为这些产品来自什么无线电器材厂。实际上，它们是高中学生或者还带着红领巾的初中孩子们设计制造的。
    年青学生们想望着原子能的和平利用。女14中初中三年级少先队第4中队第2小队队员们做的“镁原子结构模型”，陈列在化学部分。这个用木球和铁丝做的模型告诉人们：中心的红木球是原子核；周围黄、绿、黑3层铁丝圈是不同的电子层，分布在3层的12个粉色木球是电子。一个多么轻巧而清楚的模型，用作教具好得很。“煤气发生炉”、“炼铁高炉模型”、“普通火柴的制造模型”等等，也陈列在这里。真是“有重工业”，“也有轻工业”。
    米丘林的学说鼓舞着年青的学生们。生物部分的五个木框里分别养着一只白兔和一只黑兔，一只灰兔，一只更灰一些的，再一只白兔，三只不同毛色的小兔。是一家兔子的五代。第25中学生物组的学生们学习了米丘林的杂交学说以后，用兔子作实验得了这个结果。还有“草田轮作制模型”、“温床模型”、“鸡舍模型”等等。小生物学家、小农学家花了多少心血啊！
    在北京的22所中等学校里，有700多个学生参加了地质小组。他们在北京地质学院60多位大哥哥大姐姐的热情辅导下，曾经开展了各种有趣的活动。他们经常到北京市郊的红山口、八宝山等地采集矿石，并对采集到的矿石进行分析、化验。展览会的地质部分陈列着他们的成绩。第19中学地质小组做的“祖国矿产分布图”上，已经知道的铁、铜、锰、锑、钨等10多种矿产被分别标示在各出产地区。小讲解员会响亮地告诉人们：在祖国的大西北，空白点还多，正等待着我们去勘探。还有许多矿物标本陈列在这里。
    在地理部分，可以突出地看到年青学生们热爱祖国的心情。第22中学地理模型小组制作的大幅“台湾及其附近形势图”，鲜明漂亮。谁要问起这幅图的制作经过，小讲解员会首先说：台湾是祖国的明珠，是祖国的宝岛，可是台湾同胞还在美帝国主义和蒋匪帮统治下受苦难；同学们制作这个模型就是表示，我们一定要解放台湾！许多地理小组和气象小组的经纬仪模型、气象纪录等等，在这里陈列着。
    一间展览室里挂着、摆着各式各样的飞机模型。第65中学高中三年级学生古启元做的“线操纵竞速模型飞机”，小巧灵活，每小时能飞112公里，曾经获得1955年北京市航空模型测验竞速模型飞机的第二名。年青学生们热爱祖国航空事业的心情，在这里可以得到最具体的说明。
    从展览会可以看到，年青学生们的决心是：准备着，向科学堡垒进军！
