State-owned Shenyang Paper Mill Copper Wire Mesh Factory

Successfully Trial-Produces a Type of Extremely Precise Copper Wire Mesh

    The state-owned Shenyang Paper Mill Copper Wire Mesh Factory recently successfully trial-produced 250-mesh copper wire mesh. The precision of the 250-mesh copper wire mesh is such that there are 10,000 tiny holes per square centimeter, each more than half as thin as a strand of hair, which is 3,600 more small holes than the 200-mesh copper wire mesh previously successfully trial-produced by this factory. This type of copper wire mesh can be used for advanced precision filtration. Its successful trial production will save the country a lot of foreign exchange.

    试制成功一种极精密的铜丝网
    国营沈阳造纸厂铜网厂最近试制250目铜丝网成功。250目铜丝网的精密程度是每平方公分有一万个比头发丝还细一半多的小孔，比过去这个厂试制成功的200目铜丝网要多3，600个小孔。这种铜丝网可以作高级精密过滤用。它的试制成功，将为国家节省许多外汇。
