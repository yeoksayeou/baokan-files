Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

I fully endorse the political report made by Chairman Zhou Enlai, as well as the other reports of the conference.

I am an intellectual, and I believe that in the great socialist revolution of our motherland, we intellectuals, under the wise leadership and meticulous care of the Party and Chairman Mao, will surely consciously intensify our self-reform, unite more closely around the Party, diligently study Marxism-Leninism and scientific knowledge, and contribute all our strength to the socialist construction and scientific undertakings of our motherland, so as to complete the glorious and great tasks assigned to us by the Party, and to repay the Party and Chairman Mao, as well as the ardent expectations of the people of the whole country.

Fellow committee members, fellow comrades: I am an agricultural science worker who has cultivated the fine wheat variety Bima No. 1, which has been widely planted in the vast areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, and is still continuing to expand. Therefore, I would like to report some information about Bima No. 1 to all committee members and comrades here. The cultivation work of Bima No. 1 began in 1942. At that time, due to the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government's complete disregard for science, we carried out our work under extremely difficult conditions. The research results of the first two years made me doubt the guiding role of the idealist Mendelian-Morgan genetics in crop selection, and thus made me pay more attention to the practical experience of some breeders and farmers. In 1946, we began to cultivate and discover Bima No. 1. Just when this work was at a tense stage, the reactionary authorities not only did not support it, but also dismissed a trainee comrade who had been painstakingly trained by me for four years. Even the minimum conditions necessary for the experiment—land and labor—were felt to be very difficult, and my teaching work was also increased. Under the circumstances at that time, I once thought of giving up the experimental work, but Bima No. 1, this promising wheat variety, encouraged my courage to struggle. Finally, we continued the selection and breeding experiment of Bima No. 1 and stopped all other experiments. When we demonstrated and propagated Bima No. 1 in 1947 and 1948, there were even more difficulties. We barely managed to do one demonstration, and there was a lack of land for propagation. That was the most depressing period of my life.

On the third day after the liberation of Wugong in 1949, the military representative stationed in our school specifically came to the farm to see me. In a conversation of more than two hours, he gave me a lot of comfort and encouragement. I asked him to carefully look at the Bima No. 1 growing in the field. After the harvest, I sent him a copy of the experimental results of Bima No. 1. In the autumn of that year, our school assigned a special person to be responsible, and with the participation of students, all the seeds of Bima No. 1 were accelerated and propagated to 264 mu, and demonstrations were organized among the masses. Later, leading comrades of the Party and government came to Wugong to guide and arrange the promotion of Bima No. 1. In only four years, Bima No. 1 rapidly expanded from 264 mu to 7.5 million mu. At that time, many people were surprised by this promotion achievement. Now Bima No. 1 has been planted on about 20 million mu in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. According to the results of experiments, demonstrations, and large-scale planting in these areas in recent years, Bima No. 1 can generally increase production by 10% to 30% compared with the original varieties. Based on an increase of 20 jin of wheat per mu, 20 million mu can increase production by 400 million jin of grain. The acquisition of these achievements is entirely due to the Party's emphasis on and support for scientific research work. As some comrades in our school said, if it were not for liberation, who would pay attention to Bima No. 1! As some farmers in Wugong said, the Communist Party has come, the people have been liberated, and Bima No. 1 has also been liberated.

In recent years, the Party has not only given me great support and encouragement in my work, as well as many principled guidance, but also frequently cares about my political and professional studies, as well as my practical training, guiding me to comprehensively learn from Soviet experts, and guiding me to go deep into production practice to learn from the masses of farmers, so that my political awareness and professional level have been continuously improved.

In the course of work in recent years, I have deeply realized that the closer we are to the Party, the more and more truthfully we reflect our situation to the Party, the more profound education we receive, and the more help we get; the stronger our ideological feelings for the Party, the faster our political awareness and work improve. At the same time, I have also realized that only by constantly studying Marxism-Leninism can we gain greater and greater initiative in the field of scientific research work. Therefore, I feel infinitely excited about the Party's further strengthening of its leadership over intellectuals in the future.

In the future, I will definitely, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, demand myself according to the standards of a Communist Party member, and study and work diligently and honestly with the "stubbornness of dedicating my whole life to the cause of justice," and contribute all my strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席所作的政治报告以及大会的其他各项报告。
    我是一个知识分子，我相信：在祖国伟大的社会主义革命高潮中，我们知识分子在党和毛主席的英明领导和无微不至的关怀下，一定能够自觉地加紧自我改造，更紧密地团结在党的周围，孜孜不倦地学习马克思列宁主义和科学知识，为我们祖国的社会主义建设和科学事业贡献出自己的全部力量，以完成党所交给我们的光荣而伟大的任务，来报答党和毛主席以及全国人民对于我们的殷切期望。
    各位委员、各位同志：我是一个农业科学工作人员，曾经培育出了小麦良种碧蚂一号，它在黄河中、下游广大地区已经大量种植，并且还在继续扩大种植。因此，我在这里把有关碧蚂一号的一些情况向各位委员各位同志汇报一下。碧蚂一号的培育工作开始于1942年，当时由于蒋介石反动政府对于科学毫不重视，我们在极艰苦的条件下进行工作。头两年的研究结果使我对于唯心主义孟德尔—毛尔根遗传学说在作物选种上的指导作用发生了怀疑，从而更加重视了一些选种家和农民的实践经验。到1946年开始培育出和发现了碧蚂一号，正当这个工作紧张的阶段，反动当局不惟不予以支持，反而解聘了我四年辛辛苦苦培养的一位练习生同志，连进行试验所必须的最低条件——土地和人工也感到了很大的困难，同时我的教学工作也被加重了。在当时的情况下，我曾经想放弃试验工作，但是，碧蚂一号这个有希望的小麦品种鼓励了我的斗争勇气，最后我们继续了碧蚂一号的选种试验，把其他的试验都停止了。到1947和1948年示范和繁殖碧蚂一号的时候困难更多了，示范勉勉强强作了一处，繁殖缺乏土地，那时是我有生以来最苦闷的时期。
    1949年武功解放后第三天，驻我们学校的军事代表特意地到农场看我，两点多钟的谈话，他给了我很多的安慰和鼓励，我请他仔细地看了看田间生长的碧蚂一号，收获之后，我送了他一份碧蚂一号的试验结果。当年秋季我们学校指定专人负责，并由同学参加把碧蚂一号的全部种子加速繁殖了264亩，同时在群众中组织示范。后来，党政领导同志到武功指导和布置碧蚂一号的推广工作。只有四年的时间，碧蚂一号由264亩迅速地扩大到750万亩，当时许多人对这种推广成绩感到很惊奇。现在碧蚂一号在黄河中、下游地区已种植到2，000万亩左右，根据几年来在这些地区试验、示范和大面积种植的结果，碧蚂一号比原有品种一般可增产10％到30％，按每亩增产20斤小麦计算，2，000万亩可以增产四亿斤粮食。这些成绩的获得完全是由于党对于科学研究工作的重视和支持，正如我们学校有的同志所说的，如果不是解放了，碧蚂一号有谁去理睬它呢！也正如武功一些农民所说的，共产党来了，人被解放了，碧蚂一号也被解放了。
    几年来，党不仅在工作上给我以极大的支持和鼓励，以及许多原则性的指导，并经常关怀我的政治和业务学习以及实际锻炼的情况，指导我向苏联专家全面学习，指导我深入生产实际向农民群众学习，使我的政治觉悟和业务水平不断有所提高。
    在几年来的工作过程中，我深刻地体会到：我们和党靠的越紧，向党反映自己情况越多越真实，我们受到的教育就越深刻，得到的帮助也越多；我们对党的思想感情越浓厚，我们的政治觉悟和工作提高得就越快。同时，也体会到：只有不断地学习马克思列宁主义，才能在科学研究工作的领域中取得越来越大的主动权。因此，我对于党今后将要更进一步地加强对于知识分子的领导，感到无限的兴奋。
    今后，我一定要在党和毛主席的英明领导下，以共产党员的标准要求自己，以“为了正义事业献出整个生命的顽强性”勤勤恳恳、老老实实地学习和工作，为祖国的社会主义建设贡献出自己的一切力量。
