    The Ministry of Education Issues Provisional Measures on Literacy and Spare-Time Education

    The Ministry of Education issued on January 30th the "Provisional Measures for Awarding Outstanding Teachers, Outstanding Workers, Outstanding Students, and Advanced Units in Literacy Campaigns" and the "Provisional Measures for Issuing Literacy Certificates and Graduation Certificates for Spare-Time Primary and Secondary Schools."

    The award measures stipulate that teachers and staff members, units with achievements in literacy campaigns in factories, rural areas, schools, military units, government agencies, organizations, and urban residents, and students who participate in literacy learning with excellent results will be awarded at the county, provincial, and central levels, respectively, with certificates, medals, and material rewards. Counties and provinces will conduct awards annually, and the national level will conduct awards every one or two years.

    The provisional measures for graduation certificates stipulate that government cadres, workers, peasants, and urban working people who participate in spare-time learning or short-term detachment from work to study, reach the literacy standard, or complete the spare-time primary and secondary school courses prescribed by the government, will be issued literacy certificates or spare-time primary and secondary school graduation certificates after passing the examination. The effect of spare-time primary and secondary school graduation certificates is the same as that of ordinary primary and secondary school graduation certificates.
