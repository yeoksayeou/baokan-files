Comrade Zhou Enlai's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan concerns the fate of Taiwan's 8 million people. I believe that all Taiwan compatriots will be very excited to hear these words. Taiwan compatriots have only deep gratitude for the motherland's warm concern. They see light and gain strength from the motherland's call. Kuomintang military and government personnel should also be moved and repent upon hearing this.

Taiwan compatriots are all Chinese people, and they are patriotic Chinese people. For hundreds of years, they have stood at the forefront of resisting foreign aggression and have been fighting against foreign invaders. Today, they still live under the slavery of American military rule and are still fighting against the American occupation of Taiwan. In such a long-term struggle against foreign countries, Taiwan compatriots deeply understand the Taiwanese saying: "To fight tigers and catch thieves, you have to rely on your own brothers." They are constantly thinking of their brothers in the motherland and eagerly hope that the motherland will become prosperous and strong.

Only today have Taiwan compatriots seen the motherland truly stand up and seen the motherland moving forward by leaps and bounds on the road to prosperity. Now, the high tide of the socialist revolution is surging across the country, and hundreds of millions of people are marching towards socialism day and night. In the eyes of Taiwan compatriots, the progress of their brothers in the motherland on the road of socialism is also progress on the road to liberating Taiwan. When they hear the news of the high tide of socialist transformation and socialist construction, they feel that the day of Taiwan's liberation is gradually approaching. There is no doubt that today we celebrate the victory of socialist transformation, and tomorrow we will celebrate the final victory of liberating Taiwan.

To be honest, Taiwan compatriots have hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek group. Now, the Chiang Kai-shek group is still oppressing and exploiting the people of Taiwan. However, Taiwan compatriots support the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and thus also support the motherland's generous policy of not holding them accountable for past misdeeds. Kuomintang military and government personnel are also Chinese people. You should abandon your plans to rely on the United States, stand under the banner of patriotism, and work hard for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the complete reunification of the motherland. Those who have committed sins should even more arouse their patriotic conscience, strive to atone for their crimes, and not become eternal sinners of the motherland. Taking the bright road of peaceful liberation not only has precedents in the motherland's liberation war, but also has examples to follow in American history. The American Civil War came to an end: on April 9, 1865, General Lee, the commander of the South, accepted peace, and the entire army laid down its weapons. He called on his subordinates to be loyal to President Lincoln of the North, so that the United States returned to unity. This General Lee is still a respected figure in the United States. In this regard, Kuomintang military and government personnel need to learn from the United States, and the United States has no reason to prevent you from learning from General Lee.

The socialist sun of China has risen, and no demon can forever confine Taiwan in darkness. In any case, Taiwan is Chinese territory and inhabited by Chinese people. This iron fact cannot be changed by the lying genius of the United States. The United States' armed occupation of Taiwan not only invades China's sacred territory, but also deprives 8 million Chinese people of their basic rights to be Chinese citizens. The Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, absolutely cannot tolerate this American aggression. No matter what method we use, we must liberate Taiwan. No matter how treacherous the winds and waves of the Taiwan Strait are, the mainland compatriots and Taiwan compatriots can reach out their hands to build a bridge, and 600 million people throwing down their whips can fill the sea. We firmly believe that Taiwan must be returned to China!

    周恩来主席提出了和平解放台湾的号召，这个号召关系着台湾800万人的命运。我想，所有台湾同胞听到了这些话，都会很兴奋。台湾同胞对祖国温暖的关怀，只有深深的感激。他们从祖国的号召里，看到光明，得到力量。国民党军政人员听到了，也应该有所感动，有所悔悟。
    台湾同胞都是中国人，是有志气的中国人。数百年来，他们一直站在反抗外国侵略的最前线，一直在和外国侵略者作斗争。今天他们还在美国武力统治下过着奴隶的生活，还在为反抗美国侵占台湾而斗争。在这样长期的对外斗争中，台湾同胞深切体会到台湾的一句俗话：“打虎捉贼要靠亲兄弟”。他们时刻想到祖国的亲兄弟，迫切希望着祖国富强起来。
    只是到了今天，台湾同胞才看见祖国真正站立起来，看见祖国在富强的道路上大步前进。现在社会主义革命高潮在全国各地汹涌展开，数万万人日夜向社会主义进军。在台湾同胞看来，祖国兄弟在社会主义的道路上前进，也就是在解放台湾的道路上前进。他们听见社会主义改造和社会主义建设高潮的消息，也就感到台湾解放的日子渐渐逼近来了。毫无疑问地，今天我们庆祝社会主义改造胜利，明天，我们就将庆祝解放台湾的最后胜利。
    对于蒋介石集团，老实说，台湾同胞对他们是有仇恨的。现在蒋介石集团也还在压迫和剥削着台湾人民。但是台湾同胞拥护用和平方式解放台湾，从而也就拥护祖国对他们的不究既往的宽大政策。国民党军政人员同样都是中国人。你们应该抛弃投靠美国的打算，站到爱国主义的旗帜下来，为和平解放台湾、实现祖国的完全统一而努力。那些有过罪过的人，更应该激发爱国的良心，争取立功自赎，不要做祖国的千古罪人。走和平解放的光明道路，不但在祖国的解放战争中有过先例，就是在美国的历史上也有例可援。美国南北战争进行到最后：1865年4月9日，南部统帅李将军接受和平，全军放下武器，他呼吁他的部下向北部林肯总统效忠，使美国重归统一。这个李将军在美国还是被人钦佩的人物。在这点上，国民党军政人员倒需要学习美国，美国是没有理由可以阻止你们学习李将军的。
    中国社会主义的太阳出来了，任何妖魔都不能把台湾永远封蔽在黑夜里。无论如何，台湾是中国的领土、居住着中国的人民，这个铁的事实，不是美国说谎的天才所能改变的。美国用武力霸占台湾，不但侵略着中国神圣的领土，而且剥夺着800万中国人做中国公民的基本权利。中国人民包括台湾人民对美国这种侵略行为是绝对不能容忍的。无论用什么方式，我们一定要解放台湾。不管台湾海峡的风浪多么险恶，大陆同胞和台湾同胞伸出手来就可以架成桥梁，6万万人投下鞭子就可以填满大海，我们坚决相信，台湾是一定要归还中国的！
