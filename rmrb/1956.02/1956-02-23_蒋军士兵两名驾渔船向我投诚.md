Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, Zhou Liushang, a cook, and Lin Jinsong, a stretcher-bearer, both from the Third Battalion of the Second Detachment of the Chiang Kai-shek army's "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," sailed a fishing boat from the Penghu Islands to the Zhanjiao area of Zhangpu County, Fujian, at approximately 9 a.m. on February 16th and defected to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    They are both from Meizhou Island, Huian County, Fujian Province. Zhou Liushang was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek army in 1953 while fishing at sea, and Lin Jinsong was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek army in 1952. After being captured, they missed the motherland every day and were constantly looking for opportunities to return to the mainland. On the night of February 13th, they seized an opportunity, stole a fishing boat, and drifted at sea for two days and three nights before returning to the mainland.

    蒋军士兵两名驾渔船向我投诚
    据新华社讯　蒋军“反共救国军”第二总队第三大队炊事兵周刘赏和担架兵林金松在16日晨9时许驾渔船一只，从澎湖列岛到达福建漳浦县战角地区，向中国人民解放军投诚。
    他们都是福建省惠安县湄洲岛人。周刘赏在1953年在海上捕鱼的时候被蒋军抓去，林金松是在1952年被蒋军抓去的。他们被抓去以后，天天怀念祖国，时刻找机会回返大陆。2月13日晚上，他们趁隙，偷了一只渔船，在海上飘了两天三夜才回到大陆。
