    Creating a New Record of 1,076 Meters of Monthly Tunneling
    Li Zixin
    In December 1955, the Zhang Wanfu rapid tunneling team of the Datong Coal Mine, in an emulation campaign to break through 1,000 meters, tunneled a total of 1,076.75 meters, creating a new national coal mine tunneling record and fully completing all targets. In terms of per-worker efficiency, calculated in worker-tons, they completed 144.56% of the plan; calculated in worker-meters, each tunneling worker achieved 3.8183 meters. The tunnel specifications met the prescribed requirements.
    On the road to reaching the 1,000-meter target, the workers of the entire team further improved tunnel transportation and strengthened the collaboration between various work types. They took into account the long transportation distance of the newly tunneled roadway in advance, and at the end of November, they reorganized the No. 304 transportation roadway for exiting cars. At the same time, they opened a car reversing and coal loading yard at the entrances of the tunneled No. 213 and No. 214 roadways. In this way, they were able to send the 1.5-ton coal cars, which originally could only travel in the main roadway, more than 170 meters into the No. 304 roadway, thereby reducing the number of transport workers required for this roadway from five to two and increasing efficiency by 1.5 times. In order to more effectively improve the utilization rate of working hours, they conscientiously implemented the shift handover system. Every day before going down the mine, they would allocate everyone's work section and predetermine who would take over whose work. After entering the workface, they were able to start production quickly, allowing the pure production time of each shift to approach 8 hours (general tunneling teams only reach about 5 hours), and the number of tunneling blasts per shift often remained at 6 to 7, with a daily progress of more than 35 meters.
    In recent years, the workers of the Zhang Wanfu tunneling team have repeatedly created new tunneling records and completed the tunneling plan ahead of schedule every year, with the continuous improvement of their political awareness and technical level. Now, the creation of a new national record of 1,076.75 meters has set an example for all the mine's employees, playing an important role in completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. If all tunneling teams in the mine catch up with the Zhang Wanfu team, calculated based on the average monthly footage of each team in November 1955, they could tunnel more than 25,000 meters more each month, reversing the situation where tunneling lags behind extraction. The Datong Coal Mine is now preparing to summarize and promote the experience of this team.

    创造每月掘进1，076公尺的新纪录
    李自新
    1955年12月，大同煤矿张万福快速掘进组在展开突破千公尺的劳动竞赛中，共掘进1，076.75公尺，创造了全国煤矿掘进的最新纪录，全面完成了各项指标。每工效率，以工吨计，完成了计划的144.56％；以工公尺计，每掘工达到了3.8183公尺。巷道规格合乎规定要求。
    在向1，000公尺目标迈进的道路上，全组工人进一步改进了巷道运搬，密切了各工种的协作。他们事先考虑到新掘的巷道运搬距离长，在11月底就整理了出车的304运输巷，同时在所掘的213和214巷道口开拓了一个倒车装煤场。这样，他们就把原来只能在大巷内行走的一吨半的大煤车，往304巷送进了170多公尺，从而使得这一巷道所需要的搬运工人从五个人减少到两人，而且提高效率1.5倍。为了更有效地提高工时利用率，他们认真地执行了交接班制度。每天在下井前就把每个人的工作地段分配好，对谁接谁的工作也事先确定好。进入工作面后，很快就能进行生产，使每班的纯生产时间接近了8个小时（一般的掘进组只达到5小时左右），每班掘进次数经常保持在6至7发炮，日进度达到35公尺以上。
    几年来，张万福掘进组的工人们，随着政治觉悟和技术水平的不断提高，多次创造掘进新纪录，年年提前完成掘进计划。现在创造1，076.75公尺的全国新纪录，又给全矿职工树立了榜样，对提前完成五年计划起着重要作用。全矿掘进组如果都赶上张万福组，以1955年11月份各组平均月进尺计算，每月就可以多掘进25，000多公尺，扭转掘进落后于回采的局面。现在大同煤矿正准备总结并推广这个小组的经验。
