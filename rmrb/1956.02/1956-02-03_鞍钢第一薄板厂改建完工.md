The renovation project of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Thin Plate Mill has been completed and has officially commenced production. The renovation of the No. 1 Thin Plate Mill is one of the important measures taken by Anshan Iron and Steel to ensure the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan.

After the renovation, the factory's production has basically been mechanized. This year, the output of the No. 1 Thin Plate Mill will be greater than the output of the past two years, and the quality of the products will also be greatly improved.

This renovation project was designed by our country and most of the equipment was transformed from old equipment, thus saving a lot of funds for the country.

    鞍钢第一薄板厂改建完工
    鞍山钢铁公司第一薄板厂已经完成改建工程。正式投入生产。改建第一薄板厂是鞍钢保证提前完成第一个五年计划的重要措施之一。
    经过改建，这座工厂的生产已经基本上机械化了。今年第一薄板厂的产量将比过去两年的产量还多，产品质量也将大大提高。
    这项改建工程是由我国自己设计的，大部分设备是利用旧设备改造的，因此为国家节省了不少资金。
