A group of senior intellectuals in Chongqing join the Party

In the past few years since liberation, the Communist Party of China (CPC) organizations at all levels in Chongqing have successively accepted 140-plus senior intellectuals as CPC members. They include engineers, doctors, professors, writers, and famous actors. After joining the Party, they generally made more significant achievements in their work. They also played an important role in further strengthening the Party's leadership in science, technology, and culture.

With the development of the socialist construction of the motherland and the in-depth spread of Marxism-Leninism, senior intellectuals in Chongqing have become more enthusiastic about the Party's cause and have developed an urgent desire to join the Party. Among the professors in Southwest Normal College, Southwest Agricultural College, and Chongqing University, 10% to 20% have applied to join the Party. Some professors have also bought the book "How to Be a Communist" and have voluntarily organized themselves to study. Some have even developed plans to strive to join the Party after studying.

    重庆一批高级知识分子入党
    解放后几年来，中共重庆市各级组织先后接受了140多名高级知识分子为中共党员。其中包括工程师、医生、教授、作家和著名演员。他们入党以后，一般在工作上都有了更显著的成就；对于党进一步加强对科学、技术和文化的领导也起了重要作用。
    随着祖国社会主义建设事业的发展及马克思、列宁主义思想的深入传播，重庆市的高级知识分子对党的事业更加热爱，产生了入党的迫切要求。在西南师范学院、西南农学院、重庆大学等3个学校的教授中，已有10％到20％的人申请入党。一些教授还买了“怎样做一个共产党员”一书，自动组织起来学习，有的人在学习后还订出了争取入党的计划。
