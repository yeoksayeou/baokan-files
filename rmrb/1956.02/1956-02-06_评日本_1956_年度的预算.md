Commenting on Japan's 1956 Budget
    Li Gao
    The Japanese government has recently formulated the general account budget for the 1956 fiscal year, starting on April 1st of this year. This budget is characterized by a significant expansion of rearmament expenses, increased taxes, and cuts in many social welfare programs. The total budget expenditure has increased to over 1,034.9 billion yen, an increase of over 43.4 billion yen compared to the 1955 fiscal year. The Japan Socialist Party pointed out: This is a "reckless inflationary budget that seeks every possible financial resource to ensure rearmament."
    The military expenditure portion of the budget was formulated under direct American intervention. At the same time as the Japanese government submitted the budget proposal to the Diet, Japan and the United States issued a joint communique on January 30 regarding an agreement reached in the "defense burden sharing" negotiations, stipulating the direct military expenditure figures in the Japanese budget for the 1956 fiscal year. Among them, the "Defense Agency" expenditure for maintaining and expanding the Japanese armed forces is 100.2 billion yen, an increase of 13.4 billion yen compared to the 1955 fiscal year; the "facility provision fee" for expanding American military bases is 10.5 billion yen, an increase of 2.6 billion yen compared to the 1955 fiscal year; the "defense burden sharing fee" paid to the American occupation forces is 30 billion yen. In addition, the Japanese government has also stipulated that it will allocate an additional 16.3 billion yen outside the budget and use approximately 20 billion yen of the previous year's surplus military expenditure for military purposes. The budget also newly added over 3.6 billion yen for the Atomic Energy Commission. To facilitate military expansion, the "pension fee" paid to the families of former soldiers has also increased by 5.7 billion yen compared to the 1955 fiscal year. The aforementioned military expenses, plus 10 billion yen for war reparations, total more than 263.2 billion yen. The Japanese people, young and old, must bear an average of 3,000 yen in military expenses. But this is only part of it, because many other items in the budget also include large amounts of expenses related to supporting the arms industry and building military roads and ports. Even the "unemployment countermeasure fee" includes a so-called "special unemployment countermeasure fee" of 10 billion yen (an increase of 6.5 billion yen compared to the 1955 fiscal year), and a large part of this expenditure is used to recruit unemployed workers to build military projects.
    These inflated military expenditures are used, on the one hand, to maintain the American military occupation and accelerate the expansion of American air bases; on the other hand, they are used to expand Japan's armed forces. In the 1956 fiscal year, Japan plans to expand the personnel of its land, sea, and air forces by approximately 20,000 (including 10,000 ground troops), increase the number of aircraft by approximately 200 and ships by more than 5,000 tons, and will begin to study atomic weapons and purchase offensive weapons such as long-range guided missiles. However, this is only the beginning. According to the Japanese "Defense Agency's" military expansion plan, by the 1960 fiscal year, the "Defense Agency's" expenditure will increase to more than double that of 1956. But the United States still considers this plan insufficient. In the recently concluded US-Japan "defense burden sharing" negotiations, the United States has constrained Japan to quickly formulate a larger-scale long-term military expansion plan, stipulating that if Japan requests a reduction in the "defense burden sharing fee" in the future, it must double its military expansion expenses.
    In coordination with military expansion measures, a large portion of the Japanese budget is invested in the arms industry to deepen the militarization of industry. According to Kyodo News Agency on January 6, the Japanese government plans to use as much as 370 to 380 billion yen from 1955 to 1960 for "producing new defense equipment." This year, many new types of weapons will be produced, including jet aircraft, submarines, rocket launchers, heavy artillery, and tanks. The Japanese government has also formulated a special budget to export arms to other Asian countries; it is also preparing to acquire and expand a batch of arms industries that have developed abnormally since the Korean War due to accepting American orders. In this regard, the American whip is also being cracked very tightly. Recently, it threatened to "stop" so-called "special procurement orders" to force the Japanese government to allocate more military expenditure to expand the arms industry.
    The Japanese government is coping with the expenditure inflation caused by increased military expenses by further increasing the burden on the people. The budget plans to increase tax revenue by 51.9 billion yen compared to the 1955 fiscal year, totaling over 826.7 billion yen; there is also a disguised tax, "monopoly revenue," of over 112.7 billion yen. According to the price index, the real value of taxes in the Japanese budget for the 1956 fiscal year has increased to more than two and a half times that of the pre-war period (1934 to 1936 average).
    At the same time, the Japanese government is also increasing the burden on the people from many other aspects, and cutting expenses in many public welfare programs. For example, the "cultural and educational facilities fee" in the budget has decreased by 372 million yen compared to the 1955 fiscal year; the "housing countermeasure fee" has decreased from 17.3 billion yen in 1955 to 10.3 billion yen. State-owned railway fares will increase by 15%; public housing rents will increase by 10%; tuition fees at national universities will also double.
    These measures will have a great impact on the Japanese people, making their lives more difficult. Just one example is enough to illustrate this situation. For example, the measures to reduce housing construction costs and increase rents will leave more people homeless. Currently, there are 2.7 million households lacking housing in Japan, accounting for approximately one-sixth of the total number of households in the country. Because this problem is very serious, the Hatoyama government touted building houses to win votes during the election. However, after it came to power, it threw its promises to the winds. Kyodo News Agency wrote on January 8: The government "said last year that it would build 420,000 houses, but this has become empty talk and there has been no progress. Moreover, the fixed asset tax increased by 30% last year, and rents also rose accordingly. This trend will continue this year, and it will be difficult to build new houses. Because rents are going to rise again, people who rent houses will still be overshadowed by housing problems this year."
    Another very prominent aspect of the budget is that various agricultural expenses—afforestation and water control fees, food production increase countermeasure fees, disaster recovery fees, etc.—have been widely and substantially reduced. Japan is a country with a large food shortage. The Japanese government is doing this not only to reduce expenses, but also for other purposes. After the war, the amount of surplus agricultural products dumped by the United States in Japan was very large, which has greatly damaged Japanese agriculture. But Japan's comprador class has made huge profits from it, and the United States has also loaned part of the proceeds from dumping surplus agricultural products in Japan to the Japanese government as bait. In this way, they would rather sacrifice their own country's agriculture to sell more American surplus agricultural products. According to Reuters on January 10, the Japanese "Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said that such a proposition is gaining ground: it is better for Japan to import more grain than to continue to invest large sums of money to increase domestic production." It is clear that the reduction in expenses related to agricultural production in the Japanese budget is related to the policy of expanding the dumping of American surplus agricultural products in Japan.
    The Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun" also pointed out that this budget "leaves many problems for the future. … It is difficult for a poor country like Japan to hope for both butter and cannons. … The budget includes a considerable number of inflationary factors." On paper, Japan's 1956 budget is balanced, but the revenue side of the budget makes the highest estimates, leaving little room for flexibility, while the expenditure side hides many bottomless pits. For example, the military expenditure includes an off-budget allocation of 16.3 billion yen. Under the fiscal investment item, the Japanese government has a plan to use "private funds" of 130 billion yen outside the budget. As the Japan Socialist Party pointed out, there is no specific method for using private funds, "so private funds may not be collected, which may cause a reliance on the Bank of Japan and the risk of credit expansion." The Japanese government is preparing to issue banknotes with a face value of 10,000 yen this year. Inflation has become a major threat to the lives of the Japanese people and the stability of the Japanese economy.
    It is not difficult to see that Japan's 1956 budget is a budget that follows American intentions to carry out military expansion and war preparation. Japan will pay a very heavy price for this budget. It shows that Japan's military and financial affairs are increasingly controlled by the United States, which will make Japan's industry and agriculture more deformed and dependent on the United States, and will reduce domestic people's purchasing power and deepen the economic crisis. The Japanese people are also in danger of being dragged into war. This budget runs counter to the interests of the Japanese people. The Japanese government's proposal of this budget was immediately strongly opposed by the vast majority of the Japanese people and many Diet members, which is completely understandable.

    评日本1956年度的预算
    李高
    日本政府最近已经制定了从今年4月1日开始的1956财政年度的一般会计预算。这个预算的特点是：大大扩充了重整军备的费用，提高了税收，削减了许多社会公益事业方面的经费。预算的开支总额提高到了10，349亿余日元，比1955年度增加了434亿余日元。日本社会党指出：这是一个“千方百计开辟财政来源以确保重整军备的放纵性的通货膨胀预算”。
    预算中的军费部分，是在美国直接干预下制定的。在日本政府把预算案提交国会的同时，日美两国在1月30日发表了关于“防卫分担费”谈判达成协议的联合公报，规定了1956年度日本预算中的直接军费数字。其中，用于维持和扩充日本武装部队的“防卫厅”经费为1，002亿日元，比1955年度增加了134亿日元；用于扩充美军基地的“设施提供费”为105亿日元，比1955年度增加了26亿日元；付给美国占领军的“防卫分担费”为300亿日元。另外，日本政府还规定，要在预算外拨款163亿日元和把上年度结余军费约200亿日元都用在军事方面。预算中还新增加了原子能委员会经费36亿余日元。为了便于扩军，付给前军人遗属等的“恩给费”也比1955年度增加了57亿日元。上述这些军事费用再加上100亿日元的战争赔偿费，合计共达2，632亿日元以上。日本人民不分老幼，平均每人要负担军费3，000日元。但这还只是一部分，因为预算中其他许多项目下，还有大量的有关扶植军火工业、修筑军用道路、港湾等方面的费用。甚至在“失业对策费”中，也包含了所谓“特别失业对策费”100亿日元（比1955年度增加了65亿日元），而这笔开支很大部分是用来招雇失业工人去修筑军事工程的。
    这些膨胀了的军事费用，一方面是用来维持美国的军事占领，并加紧扩充美国空军基地；另一方面是用来扩大日本的武装部队。在1956年度，日本计划将陆、海、空部队扩充人员约20，000人（其中地面部队10，000人），增加飞机约200架和舰只5，000吨以上，并将开始研究原子武器和购入远程定向飞弹等进攻性武器。可是，这还只是一个开始。根据日本“防卫厅”的扩军计划，到1960年度，“防卫厅”经费将递增到比1956年再扩大一倍多。但是美国对这个计划还嫌不够。在刚结束的美日“防卫分担费”谈判中，美国已约束日本，要它赶快制定更大规模的长期扩军计划，规定日本以后如果要求削减“防卫分担费”，它就必须加倍增加扩军费用。
    同扩军措施相配合，日本预算中把很大一部分费用投向军火工业，以加深工业的军事化。据共同社1月6日报道，日本政府计划用来“生产新的防卫装备”的经费，在1955到1960年将达三千七、八百亿日元之多。今年就将生产许多新品种武器，包括喷气式飞机、潜水艇、火箭炮和重型大炮、坦克等。日本政府还制定有专款预算，用来向其他亚洲国家输出军火；又准备把朝鲜战争以来因接受美国订货而畸形发展起来的一批军火工业，由国家收购并加以扩充。在这方面，美国的督促鞭子也抽得很紧。最近，它就曾以“停止”所谓“特需订货”为威胁，强迫日本政府拨更多的军费来扩大军火工业。
    日本政府用更加加重人民的负担，来应付由于军事费用增加所引起的开支膨胀，预算中计划把租税收入比1955年度提高519亿日元，共达8，267亿余日元；还有变相的捐税“专卖收入”1，127亿余日元。按物价指数计算，1956年度日本预算中的捐税实值，加重到了战前（1934至1936年平均）的两倍半以上。
    同时，日本政府还从其他许多方面来加重人民的负担，并且削减许多公益事业方面的开支。例如，预算中的“文教设施费”比1955年度减少了37，200万日元；“住宅对策费”由1955年的173亿日元减少到了103亿日元。国营铁路运费将加价15％；公营住宅的房租将提高10％；国立大学的学费也将增加一倍。
    这些措施，将使日本人民受到很大影响，使他们的生活处于更加困难之境。这只要举一个例子就足以说明这种情况。如削减住宅建筑费和提高房租的措施，就将使更多的人无栖身之所。目前，日本缺乏房屋的有270万户，约占全国总户数的六分之一。由于这个问题十分严重，鸠山政府在竞选中曾标榜着修筑住宅来取得选票。可是，在它上台以后，就把自己的诺言抛到九霄云外去了。共同社在1月8日写道：政府“去年说要建设42万户住宅，但这成了空话，没有什么进展。并且，去年固定资产税提高了30％，房租也随着上涨。今年将仍然继续这种趋势，新的房屋很难建造起来。由于房租还要上涨，租房住的人今年在住宅问题上还要笼罩上一层阴影。”
    预算中还有一个很突出的地方，即关于农业方面的各项费用——造林治水费、食粮增产对策费、灾害复旧费等，普遍被大量地削减。日本是缺粮很多的国家，日本政府这样做，不仅是为了缩减开支，而且还有另外的用意。战后，美国在日本倾销剩余农产品的数量十分庞大，这已使日本的农业受到很大损害。但日本的买办阶级却从中大收渔利，美国还把在日本倾销剩余农产品的一部分价款贷给日本政府作为诱饵。这样，他们就宁愿牺牲本国的农业，来销纳更多的美国剩余农产品。据路透社1月10日报道，日本“农林省说，这样的主张正在获得根据：日本还是多输入一些粮食，比继续投入大笔资金来增加国内的生产要好。”很明显，日本预算中削减有关农业生产的费用，是同扩大美国剩余农产品在日本的倾销的政策有关的。
    日本“每日新闻”还指出，这个预算“给将来留下了许多问题。……像日本这样一个穷国家，同时希望牛油和大炮是困难的。……预算中包括了相当多的通货膨胀的因素。”在纸面上，日本1956年度的预算是收支平衡的，可是预算中在收入方面都作了最高的估计，很少伸缩余地，而开支方面却隐藏着许多无底洞。例如在军费中，就列有163亿日元的预算外拨款。在财政投资项下，日本政府列有在预算外利用“民间资金”1，300亿日元的计划。正如日本社会党所指出，利用民间资金的具体方法是没有的，“所以民间资金收集不起来，很可能造成对日本银行的依赖和信用膨胀的危险。”日本政府已准备在今年发行票面额10，000日元的大钞了。通货膨胀已成为对日本人民的生活和日本经济的稳定的一个很大的威胁。
    不难看出，日本1956年的预算，是一个遵循美国意旨执行扩军备战的预算。日本将为这个预算付出十分沉重的代价。它表明日本的军事和财政日甚一日地受美国的控制，将使日本的工农业更加畸形发展和依附于美国，并且将缩小国内人民的购买力而加深经济危机。日本人民还有被拖入战争的危险。这个预算是同日本人民的利益背道而驰的。日本政府提出这个预算后，立即遭到日本广大人民和许多议员的强烈反对，这是完全可以理解的。
