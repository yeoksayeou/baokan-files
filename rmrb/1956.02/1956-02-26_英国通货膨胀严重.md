Xinhua News Agency, London: British newspapers, in commenting on the new anti-inflation measures presented to the House of Commons by Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan, pointed out that the adoption of these new measures indicates that the British economy is being subjected to increasing inflationary pressure. Some influential newspapers believe that these new measures will have adverse consequences for the British economy.

The serious threat of inflation to the British economy has recently been a topic of discussion in the British press. Many newspapers have pointed out that continuous inflation is leading to a continuous increase in the amount of pounds circulating in the market, while bank deposits are decreasing significantly. Because the credit of the pound is constantly weakening, Reuters said that the exchange rate of the pound has been in a volatile state in European financial markets recently.

British newspapers also pointed out that due to the development of inflation, Britain's competitiveness in the international market has weakened. Despite repeated attempts by the British government to improve international trade, the trade deficit reached £864 million in 1955; in January of this year, the trade deficit still amounted to £74 million.

The newspapers also pointed out the impact of inflation on the prices of goods. In 1955 alone, retail prices rose by 9%, and wholesale prices, such as fuel prices, rose by 13%. Rising prices seriously threaten the living standards of the vast majority of the people. Since the beginning of this year, 9 million workers have already made demands for wage increases.

    英国通货膨胀严重
    据新华社讯　伦敦消息：英国报纸在评论财政大臣麦克米伦向下院提出的新的反通货膨胀的措施时指出，采取这些新措施表明英国经济正受到不断增长的通货膨胀的压力。一些有影响的报纸认为，这些新措施将对英国经济产生恶果。
    通货膨胀对英国经济的严重威胁，最近以来一直是英国报刊议论的主题。许多报刊指出，继续不断的通货膨胀使得市场上英镑流通量不断增加，而银行的存款大量减少。由于英镑信用在不断削弱，路透社说，最近在欧洲的金融市场上，英镑的比价处于一种动荡不定的状态。
    英国报刊同时指出，由于通货膨胀的发展，英国在国际市场上的竞争能力减弱了。尽管英国政府一再企图改善国际贸易，但是1955年贸易逆差达到了86，400万英镑；在今年1月份，贸易逆差仍达7，400万英镑。
    报刊还指出通货膨胀对货物价格的影响。在1955年一年内，零售价格上升了9％，批发价格，例如燃料价格上涨了13％。物价上涨严重地威胁着广大人民的生活水平。今年年初以来，已经有900万工人提出了增加工资的要求。
