    An Excellent Driver
    By our reporter, Cao Baoming
    He Changxian, a truck driver from the Hubei Provincial Transportation Bureau, is already working on his work volume for the second half of 1957. He guarantees that he will complete his five-year transportation plan one year and eight months ahead of schedule, before April of this year.
    He Changxian drives a "Category Three Vehicle" assembled from old parts on a "Grade C Road." However, He Changxian was still able to complete four years of transportation plan in two years and seven months. The vehicle traveled more than 97,000 kilometers with only one intermediate repair, saving the cost of two major repairs and one intermediate repair. His tires traveled more than 170,000 tire kilometers beyond the quota, saving seven new tires. He also saved more than 2,000 liters of gasoline. In the past three years, he has not had any accidents for which he was responsible, nor has he broken down on the road. He has never missed a single mailbag or passenger's small package. He has never been absent from work, transporting passengers as usual, whether it is windy or rainy, or on holidays.
    He Changxian also actively helps comrades in the group to adjust machine parts and improve operations. The group's transportation plan and various economic indicators have been completed very well. The whole group also decided to complete the five-year plan in four years and create 100,000 yuan of wealth for the country.
    Now, highway transport workers throughout Hubei Province are learning from his advanced experience. Workers in factories and mines in Jingzhou, Xinzhou and other places are also inspired by He Changxian's pioneering spirit and have decided to strive to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule.
    He Changxian mainly maintains the vehicle well in accordance with the operating procedures. Every time he goes out, he always checks the machine. While driving, he takes a comprehensive look at the instruments every 3 kilometers, and every time he reaches a station (30 kilometers), he gets off the bus to check the parts that are prone to failure and the tire pressure. As soon as the vehicle returns to the terminal, he starts to clean the vehicle, maintain and adjust the machine parts. The operating procedures stipulate that the tire pressure should be checked before departure. Some drivers simply knock on the tires with a hammer and consider it a check; however, he believes that excessive or insufficient tire pressure will increase tire wear, so he accurately measures it with a pressure gauge every day, and only drives when the tires actually reach the standard pressure. The operating procedures stipulate that the machine parts must be well lubricated. Some drivers add oil and start the machine regardless of the condition of the lubricating oil in the vehicle; however, he believes that the oil will solidify in the vehicle in winter, and the machine parts will not be well lubricated and will easily wear out. Therefore, he always uses a hand crank to crank the engine dozens of times to allow the lubricating oil to melt into each part of the machine, and uses idle speed operation to raise the temperature to 50 degrees Celsius before driving the car, thereby reducing wear and tear on the machine parts. He always controls the car within an economical speed of 25 to 30 kilometers per hour, and always digs out the stones embedded in the tires. In this way, the perfect condition rate of his car is more than 20% higher than usual, and he can drive more than 200 days more in three years.
    In 1952, shortly after He Changxian joined the Party, the number of vehicles at the Wuchang Automobile Terminal increased from 17 to more than 100. The original assistants were all promoted to drivers, and assistants were in short supply. Some vehicles could not be dispatched because they were not equipped with assistants. At this time, a driver in Jiangxi was able to drive alone, and the leaders of the Wuchang Automobile Terminal considered promoting this experience. However, many people believe that they drive passenger cars that burn charcoal and must depart on time, and one driver cannot handle it alone. In particular, the horsepower of charcoal trucks is weak, and assistants often need to follow behind the car to pad the triangular wood when going uphill. How could one driver do it alone! The leaders asked He Changxian to study this. He Changxian believed that it could be driven alone, and only required that the motor and battery be repaired and the motor be used to replace the hand-crank start. As a result, he successfully drove the car alone for several months. Some drivers also requested to drive alone at this time. The Transportation Bureau also promoted his experience throughout Hubei Province, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient manpower and saving more than 82,000 yuan in assistant wages.
    In 1954, rural areas in Hubei Province suffered from floods, and cars throughout the province were rushing grain and various relief supplies to the countryside. On the Tong (cheng) Zhao (Liqiao) line, only He Changxian's bus was left. How can we keep our car running every day? This is a "Grade C Road." The state stipulates that the car must undergo secondary maintenance every 3,000 kilometers, and the car must be stopped for two days for each maintenance. At this time, He Changxian was thinking about ways to keep the car running every day. The stationmaster of Wuchang Automobile Terminal also encouraged him to find ways to overcome this difficulty. The winter of 1954 was particularly cold, and it often snowed, but He Changxian drove out every day before dawn and returned to the station at dark, regardless of wind or snow. There was no garage at the station, and the car was parked in the snow. He also crawled into the car every day to check and repair the machine parts. At this time, he also came up with a "cyclic maintenance" method, according to the various "assemblies" of the car's machine parts, to maintain them in a planned and orderly manner. Today, he will maintain the rear hub of the car, tomorrow he will maintain the engine, and the day after tomorrow he will maintain the transmission equipment... In this way, after driving 3,000 kilometers, it only takes half a day to repair it, and he can still drive the car that day. He worked on this line for more than seven months. Except for two days when the road was frozen and the bureau ordered a stop, he drove the car every day. The perfect condition rate and working vehicle rate of his car reached 100% for four months.
    He Changxian's group has a total of 5 cars, but only Dou Shuhua and Guo Ruihe failed to meet the gasoline consumption quota, and lost more than 100 liters of gasoline per month. They asked the inspectors for help, but the problem was not solved. He Changxian went with Zhang Shidao and Lei Xiangsheng in the group to help the two comrades adjust the machine parts. He Changxian also followed Guo Ruihe for a day to help him improve his operation. He also gave his well-adjusted carburetor to Dou Shuhua for use, and then readjusted Dou Shuhua's. As a result, all 5 cars in their group broke through the gasoline consumption quota, saving more than 4,000 liters of gasoline in the past three years.

    卓越的司机

    湖北省运输局的汽车司机何昌贤已经在做1957年下半年的工作量了。他保证在今年4月以前，提前一年零八个月完成五年运输计划。
    何昌贤驾的是旧车拼装的“三类车”，行的是“丙级路”。但是，何昌贤还能在两年零七个月内完成了四年的运输计划，车子走了97，000多公里只中修过一次，省了两次大修和一次中修的费用。他的轮胎比定额多走了17万多胎公里，节约了7只新轮胎。他还节约了2，000多公升的汽油。三年来，他没有出过任何责任事故，也没有在中途抛过锚，连邮包和旅客的小包都没错过一件。他也没有缺过勤，无论是刮风下雨，或是例假节日，都照常开着车子运送旅客。
    何昌贤还积极帮助小组里的同志调整机件和改善操作，小组的运输计划和各项经济指标都完成得很好。全组也决定四年完成五年计划，为国家多创造10万元财富。
    现在，湖北全省的公路运输工人都在学习他的先进经验。荆州、新洲等地的工厂和矿山的工人也为何昌贤的首创精神所鼓舞，决定要争取提前完成五年计划。
    何昌贤最主要是按规程把车子保养得好。每次出车，他总把机器检查一遍；行车中，他每走3公里就全面看一次仪表，每走到一站（30公里），就下车检查一次容易发生故障的机件和轮胎的气压；车子一回终点站，就动手清洗车子，保养和调整机件。操作规程里规定出车前应检查轮胎的气压，有的司机只是用鎯头敲敲轮胎便算检查过了；而他认为轮胎气压大了或小了都会增加轮胎损耗，每天都是用气压表测量准确，要轮胎确实达到标准气压才开车。操作规程规定机件必须润滑良好，有的司机把机油一加，不管润滑油在车内的情况如何，便开动机器；而他认为冬季里机油会在车内凝固，机件润滑不好，容易磨损，所以总是先用手摇柄将发动机空摇数十转，使滑润油融化到机件的各部分，并且用怠速运转的办法把温度升到摄氏50度，才把车开走，减少机件损耗。他总是把汽车控制在每小时25至30公里的经济速度内，并且随时把嵌入轮胎内的石子挖出。这样他的汽车的完好率就比一般高出20％多，三年就能多出车200多天。
    1952年，何昌贤入党不久，武昌汽车总站的汽车从17辆增加到100多辆，原有的助手都提升成了司机，助手很缺，有的车子就因为配不上助手出不了车。这时，江西有个司机能够单人驾驶，武昌汽车总站领导上就考虑推行这个经验。但是，许多人认为他们开的是烧木炭的客车，必须按时开出，司机一人忙不过来。特别是木炭车的马力弱，上坡的时候常常需要助手跟在汽车后面垫三角木，光司机一人怎么也干不了！领导上找何昌贤研究，何昌贤认为可以单人行驶，只要求把马达和电瓶修好，用马达代替手摇发动。结果，他成功地单人行驶了几个月的车。有的司机这时也请求单人驾驶，运输局也在湖北全省推广他的经验，克服了人力不足的困难，节约了82，000多元的助手工资。
    1954年，湖北省的农村遭受水灾，全省的汽车都在为农村赶运粮食和各种救济物资。在通（城）赵（李桥）线上，就只留下何昌贤的一部客车。怎么才能使自己的车子一天也不停呢？这是一条“丙级路”，国家规定汽车每行驶3，000公里必须实行二级保养，保养一次就得停车两天。何昌贤这时就成天琢磨使汽车一天不停的办法。武昌汽车总站站长也鼓励他想办法克服这个困难。1954年的冬天特别冷，经常下雪，但是何昌贤无论刮风下雪，每天都是天不明就出车，天黑才回站。站上没有车库，车子就停在雪地里，他也是天天钻到车下去检查和修理机件。他这时还想出了“循环保养”的办法，按照汽车机件的各个“总成”，有计划地顺序保养，今天保养车子的后毂，明天保养发动机，后天保养传动设备……这样一来，行驶了3，000公里后，只需半天时间就修整好了，当天仍然能够出车。他在这条线上工作了七个多月，除了两天因为路上冰冻局令停车外，每天都出了车。他的车子的完好率和工作车率有4个月都达到100％。
    何昌贤小组一共5辆车，只有窦树华和郭瑞和两人达不到汽油消耗定额，每月都亏损100多公升汽油。他们找检验员想办法也没解决，何昌贤就同组里的张世道、雷祥胜去帮助这两个同志调整机件。何昌贤还跟了郭瑞和出一天车，帮助他改进操作。他又把自己调整好了的气化器给窦树华使用，自己再把窦树华的重新调整。结果，他们小组5辆车都突破了汽油消耗定额，三年来共节约了4，000多公升汽油。
