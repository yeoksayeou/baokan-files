    Vigorously Summarize and Promote Advanced Experiences
    The Shanghai Motor Factory is adopting the Kovalev work method in all 16 major types of work and 7 business systems throughout the factory, summarizing the many scattered individual experiences of employees into a complete set of advanced experiences.
    The 5 sets of coil embedding and joint working methods being promoted in the coil embedding section of the rotating motor workshop integrate the operational advantages of 12 coil embedding workers. Worker Wei Peichang frequently exceeded his quota, so cadres and technicians, based on this clue, compared his operations with those of other workers and identified several advantages in Wei Peichang's operations. However, some of Wei Peichang's operations were not as good as those of Liu Shuangfu, Lu Yincai, and other workers, so the operational advantages of these workers were also incorporated. Workers reflected that female worker Huang Xiaomei was a "scraping expert," scraping very quickly, so Huang Xiaomei's scraping method was also incorporated. Finally, the experiences of 12 workers were centralized into 5 sets of working methods, which were discussed by all the workers in the section and many supplements were made. After these 5 sets of working methods were promoted throughout the workshop, 90% of the workers exceeded their quotas in January, a twofold increase compared to before the promotion.
    The design department of the factory has also summarized 11 individual drafting experiences into a set of advanced drafting methods, and has also organized relevant designers to talk freely about their design experiences, which have been initially summarized into design experiences for three types of products: DC generators, AC generators, and transformers. Technician Zhao Zhiqing of the process department, in summarizing and analyzing the process of small-batch trial production of new product power capacitors, identified 10 advanced experiences, including Soviet advanced experience, worker rationalization proposals, improved equipment, tools and operations, and reasonable reduction of processes. After measurement and promotion, it can shorten the man-hours for manufacturing power capacitors by more than 30%.
    While vigorously summarizing advanced experiences, the Shanghai Motor Factory also adopts methods such as holding advanced experience performances, advanced experience training classes, and signing contracts for teaching and learning according to types of work and business systems to exchange and promote advanced experiences, and incorporates the advanced experiences that have been summarized into the process regulations for implementation.

### 大力总结和推广先进经验

    大力总结和推广先进经验
    上海电机厂正在全厂16个主要工种和7个业务系统中，采用郭瓦廖夫的工作方法，把散布在职工中的许多点滴经验，总结成了一套一套的完整的先进经验。
    正在旋转电机车间嵌线工段中推行的5套嵌线和接头工作法，就综合了12个嵌线工人的操作优点。工人魏培昌经常突破定额，干部和技术人员就根据这个线索，同其他工人的操作比较以后，找出了魏培昌操作的几个优点。但是魏培昌的有些操作，又不如刘双富、陆银才等工人的好，于是又吸收了这些工人的操作优点。工人们反映女工黄小妹是个“刮头专家”，刮头刮得很快，于是黄小妹的刮头方法又被吸收了。最后集中了12个工人的经验成为5套工作法，全工段工人进行了讨论，又作了许多补充。这5套工作法在全车间推广以后，1月份就有90％的工人突破定额，人数比推广前增加了2倍。
    这个厂的设计科也已经把11个单个的绘图经验，总结成为一套先进绘图法，并且还组织了有关设计人员，漫谈自己的设计经验，已经初步总结成为直流发电机、交流发电机和变压器三种产品设计经验。工艺科技术员赵志清，在总结分析小批试制新产品电力电容器的工艺中，找出了包括苏联先进经验、职工合理化建议、改进设备、工具和操作、合理减少工序等10点先进经验。经过测算、推行以后，可以缩短制造电力电容器的工时30％以上。
    上海电机厂在大力总结先进经验的同时，还按工种和业务系统采取举办先进经验表演、先进经验训练班、订立包教保学合同等办法，交流和推广先进经验，并且把已经总结出的先进经验订入工艺守则中去，以便贯彻执行。
