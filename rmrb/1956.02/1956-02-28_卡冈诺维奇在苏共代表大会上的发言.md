The report of the Central Committee and the 20th Congress of the Party itself have far-reaching significance beyond the Party and our country. This is because our Party leads a powerful Soviet state, which plays a huge role in international politics and has an increasingly decisive influence on the course of world events. This is also because the 20th Congress is being held at a time when the construction of communism by the Soviet people under the leadership of our Party has entered a new and most important stage.

The report on the work of the Central Committee, delivered by N.S. Khrushchev, clearly and convincingly demonstrates the boundless creative power of our mighty and beloved Bolshevik Party. (Applause)

The period covered by the report was a complex and difficult one in the life of our Party and state.

It is necessary to recall that soon after the 19th Congress, the enemies of the Soviet Union, the enemies of communism, and the enemies of peace had sinister plans. They hoped for a crisis in our Party and its leadership, for conflicts between the working class and the peasantry, and among the various nationalities of our multi-ethnic state.

Now, the whole world can see that the bosses of imperialism and the hysterical soothsayers have once again suffered a complete defeat.

At the time of the 20th Congress, the great Party, with its 7 million members, is united as one, and is closely united around the Leninist Central Committee and its Presidium, which adheres to the principle of collective leadership. (Stormy applause)

The alliance between the working class and the collective farmers, and the friendship among the peoples of our country, have been immeasurably strengthened. The Soviet people have rallied even more closely around our Party.

Relying on the tried-and-true Bolshevik methods of bold criticism and self-criticism, the Party and its Central Committee have correctly solved the extremely large and complex problems that have sharply arisen before the Party and the state.

The criminal activities of the fascist gang of Beylia have been boldly and decisively exposed and liquidated. As a result, the Party and the Soviet state have become even stronger.

The serious imbalance between the development of industry and the growth of the needs of the people, on the one hand, and the backwardness of agriculture, on the other, has been revealed in a principled and truly detailed manner. Measures to improve the situation in agriculture have been developed and, to some extent, implemented.

The problems of technological progress in industry, transportation, and agriculture have been raised to a new level. Measures to improve the situation in industry and eliminate its shortcomings have been developed. On the basis of evaluating modern conditions and circumstances from a Marxist-Leninist perspective, the Soviet Union has boldly displayed great initiative in its foreign policy and the struggle for peace.

The main conclusion of the 20th Congress is that the peoples of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Party and relying on the achievements of the industrialization and collectivization of the country, have successfully completed the fifth five-year plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule.

In the matter of improving the material well-being of the people and the victorious construction of communism, a great step forward has been taken.

The eternal bonds of brotherly friendship between the great People's Republic of China and other people's democracies—the Polish People's Republic, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the Bulgarian People's Republic, the People's Republic of Albania, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—and the leading force of the powerful socialist camp—the Soviet Union—have been further strengthened. The Soviet state has achieved great victories in the struggle for peace, security, and friendship among the peoples of the world.

The supreme body of the Party—the 20th Congress—has every reason to be very satisfied with the activities of the Central Committee, which has successfully led the Party and all the people along the great path of Lenin. (Stormy applause)

I

The report of the Central Committee provides a clear picture and gives a profound Marxist analysis of the great achievements of the Party in the struggle for universal peace, international security, and friendship among the peoples of the world, in the struggle for peaceful coexistence among states (regardless of their social and political systems).

The victories of our foreign policy are the result of the Central Committee's correct and consistent implementation of Lenin's wise policy.

The strength of our Party's foreign policy lies in the fact that it is extremely scientific; it is based on Lenin's analysis of the dying, rotten capitalism—imperialism. Our Party and government have revealed the laws of the development of the world economy and politics, assessed the changes in the balance of class forces on the international stage, and have timely proposed and successfully solved one new task after another, ensuring the strengthening of the position of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, which means the weakening of the position of imperialism.

The great leader of the Party and the Soviet state, V.I. Lenin, pointed out that as a result of the victory of the October Revolution, the world was divided into two opposing systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system. After that, world politics would develop along two lines: one line is that the doomed exploiting classes strive to maintain their rule over the working class and laboring masses of their own countries, and to keep the enslaved and oppressed peoples of other countries in a subordinate position.

The other line is that the working class and the oppressed peoples resolutely demand a new society to replace the old society based on exploitation, slavery, oppression (the source of wars, crises, unemployment, poverty, and hunger of the masses), in which the peoples freed from social and national oppression, free and independent, will develop their relations on the basis of peace, brotherly cooperation, mutual respect, and mutual assistance.

The great teacher of the proletariat, K. Marx, scientifically proved that such a society is inevitable. He wrote: "In the old society, there is economic poverty and political arbitrariness, and in contrast to the old society, a new society will arise, the international principle of which is peace, because each nation has a common ruler—the labor!" (Selected Works of K. Marx and F. Engels, Russian edition, Vol. 1, p. 449)

The entire course of world events has confirmed the correctness of the foresight of the founders of scientific communism. This is again confirmed in the report of the Central Committee to the 20th Congress.

In the period between the 19th and 20th Congresses, the international prestige of the Soviet Union and its influence on the course of world events have greatly increased. The international position of the socialist camp countries, led by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, has been further strengthened. Friendship and brotherly relations with Yugoslavia have been restored.

On the other hand, the general crisis of capitalism has become more acute, and the imperialist colonial system is on the verge of collapse.

The fundamental changes in the world arena have created the most favorable prospects and conditions for strengthening the struggle for peaceful coexistence among states with different social and political systems, for preventing war.

Therefore, in the report of the Central Committee, N.S. Khrushchev creatively and not dogmatically, dialectically and not metaphysically, applied Marxism-Leninism, assessed the changes that have taken place, and correctly approached some of the most important problems from a new angle. These problems include the problems of peaceful coexistence, the possibility of preventing war, the forms and paths of transition to socialism, etc. All these problems are closely interrelated.

The problem of war and peace has decisive significance because it is an urgent and extremely important problem for millions of people in every corner of the globe who have experienced two world wars in the 20th century.

It goes without saying that we still understand the causes of war, especially under imperialist conditions, from the class standpoint of Marxism-Leninism.

The Soviet state, by its class nature, is incompatible with the attempts to wage war for the purpose of imposing one's own ideology and socio-political system on other peoples by force, of solving international disputes by force, and especially of seizing the territory and enslaving the peoples of other countries.

As for imperialism, by its very nature, it is warlike. However, its warlike nature is not always manifest, because it has produced an opponent who restrains its savage nature and, if necessary, will destroy it—the working class.

The peoples of the world are the decisive force that blocks the path to a new war. The weight of this force, the will of the peoples of the world for peace, their determination not to allow a new destructive world war, has grown immeasurably in recent times. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from the balance of forces in the present era that war is not inevitable is absolutely correct. We are convinced that if the peoples of the world take up the cause of maintaining peace and carry it through to the end, peace can be preserved and strengthened! (Applause)

At the same time, the peoples of the world, first and foremost the Soviet people, should take into account the adventurous nature of imperialist reactionary forces and, therefore, must maintain the greatest vigilance.

We must expose the reactionary imperialist forces of aggression, we must wage the struggle for disarmament, and if temporary agreements on disarmament cannot be reached, we must strengthen the defensive power of our homeland, improve our brave armed forces, and make the Soviet Union an increasingly powerful and reliable bastion of universal peace, security, and friendship among the peoples. The better we do all this, the more real the possibility of stopping war becomes. (Prolonged applause)

The great peoples of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of India, etc., who have close brotherly ties of friendship, jointly struggle for peaceful coexistence among all countries, regardless of their social and political systems, which has historical significance.

Lenin, in his article "Better Fewer, but Better," analyzed the prospects for the development of the world and wrote 33 years ago: "The outcome of the struggle ultimately depends on the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., which make up the absolute majority of the world's population, have recently been very rapidly drawn into the struggle for their own liberation, so in this sense there can be no doubt about the final solution of the question of the world struggle. Therefore, in this sense, the final victory of socialism is completely and absolutely guaranteed." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 33, p. 458)

Now the whole world sees: how the genius of humanity, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, has been confirmed. (Stormy applause)

If Lenin could see how the people of India welcome the emissaries of the socialist Soviet state, Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Bulganin, and how close the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of India are politically, he would certainly say with joy: "This is what I hoped for." (Applause)

The class contradictions within the capitalist countries are becoming more acute, and the working class and the broad masses of the people are not only struggling for their economic interests but also against the arms race, for peace, and for the easing of international tensions. This is of great importance.

The tendency for the working class to unite, to unite all patriotic and democratic forces on the basis of defending national independence and rejecting subordination to foreign imperialism, is growing. All this is especially evident in France and Italy, where the Communist Party has achieved brilliant victories in parliamentary elections, and we, the Party and all the Soviet people, are sincerely glad for this! (Applause)

As always, we stand on our revolutionary class position: socialism must inevitably replace capitalism, and only socialism can free the people from the tragic phenomena of exploitation, oppression, poverty, war, crises, unemployment, etc.

However, the question of the forms of transition to socialism should be solved concretely, according to the specific conditions of each country and taking into account new historical experience.

This is the great experience of China and the people's democracies. The people's governments of these countries are successfully building socialism, relying on the mass revolutionary movement of the proletariat and the laboring masses, while at the same time using parliamentary forms and filling them with new content—people's democracy. The Soviet people and our Party are sincerely glad about our brothers' historic victories. The guarantee of this is the decisive condition of the political leadership of the working class and its revolutionary vanguard. (Applause)

All this is possible because socialism has triumphed in the Soviet Union. Now, almost half of the world's population has become a bastion of socialism, which creates favorable conditions for the transition of individual countries, under certain conditions, to socialism without a domestic war.

At the same time, we believe that it is possible to use the parliamentary form by achieving a stable majority, but this stable majority must be based on the mass revolutionary movement of the proletariat (which, with its revolutionary vanguard at the head, exercises political leadership over all the masses).

In the historical conditions of the present era, the strategic and tactical principles of Lenin, especially those set forth in his famous work "The 'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder," have special significance.

Lenin taught the communists to "apply the general and fundamental principles of communism to the specific conditions of the mutual relations of the classes and parties in one's own country, to the specific conditions of the objective development of one's own country to communism, which are different in each country, and we must learn to study, explore, and guess at these specific conditions." He also emphasized that "one must learn to turn all new and old forms into weapons for the complete and final, decisive and thorough victory of communism." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 31, pp. 69-70, 83)

The formulations of some fundamental problems of the current international development in the report of the Central Committee have not only theoretical but also practical significance for our Party, for the brotherly communist and workers' parties.

If we consider the changed international situation, relying on the growing demand of the working class for unity, relying on the desire of all true democratic and progressive forces to unite for national independence, social progress, peace, and the struggle against war, our brother parties can achieve great successes.

I sincerely wish the brother communist and workers' parties success in the struggle for the unity of the working class and in their noble struggle for peace and socialism.

It can be said without any doubt that the fundamental problems raised in the report of the Central Committee and expounded by Comrade Khrushchev will receive the support of the 20th Congress of the Party. The decision of the 20th Congress will greatly strengthen the position of our Party and the Soviet state in the struggle for peaceful coexistence, the prevention of war, the friendship of the peoples of the world, and the unity of the working class in the struggle for socialism. (Stormy applause)

II

Comrades! We have also strengthened and improved our international environment because we have relied on highly developed industry, and, first of all, we have not fallen behind, and in some respects even surpassed the United States, in the production of the most modern defense products. Secondly, we have strengthened the political situation at home, and achieved great successes in the development of agriculture and industry.

After the 19th Congress of the Party, the Central Committee, on the basis of Bolshevik principles, resolutely adopted, approved, and implemented a series of historically significant major decisions in the field of agriculture. The Central Committee held four plenary sessions to study the problems of increasing the production of grain and livestock, the development of virgin and fallow lands, and further strengthening the collective farms and state farms.

The Party and the government concentrated manpower and material resources to ensure a significant increase in agriculture because agriculture, which was destroyed during the war, was in a difficult situation.

Among all the measures taken by the Central Committee after the 19th Congress of the Party, the most significant was the decision to develop vast virgin and fallow lands, to send cadres to strengthen the collective farms, and other decisions. As a result of a series of economic measures, the material interest of the collective farmers in increasing the production of the collective farms has been greatly increased. The Party has strengthened the Leninist alliance of workers and peasants.

The workers of the machine-tractor stations and state farms are now a fairly large contingent of our working class. The machine-tractor stations themselves have been greatly strengthened and equipped with a large number of advanced technologies. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates a significant increase in the technical equipment of agriculture, and this task must be completed at any cost.

Now the main task of the Central Committee is to significantly increase the yield per unit area of all collective farms and state farms, especially in densely populated areas. It is necessary to significantly increase the supply of mineral fertilizers to agriculture, and therefore, the role of the chemical industry should be increased. These problems will also be studied during the implementation of the Five-Year Plan in order to overfulfill the tasks.

The Party and the Central Committee have done very important work: they have sent about 30,000 capable workers to take up the chairmanship of the management boards of backward collective farms in order to strengthen the collective farms.

During the period of struggle for collectivization, 25,000 workers and political department workers of machine-tractor stations and state farms who went to the countryside were mostly political organizers. Now the workers sent to the countryside, in addition to political experience, also have engineering and agricultural knowledge. It is necessary to continue to fully support them, to raise their professional level, and not to lose contact with them, so that this most important organizational measure of the Party will bear fruit in the further rise of socialist agriculture.

In the field of industry, the Central Committee and the government have developed and implemented a series of major measures in the period covered by the report, which have ensured the successful completion and overfulfillment of the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan set by the 19th Congress of the Party.

The decision of the July 1955 Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee has particular significance. The resolution pointed out a principled path: further development of socialist industry, especially heavy industry, which is the unshakable foundation for the development of the entire economy, the strengthening of the country's defense, the improvement of agriculture, and the development of consumer goods industry.

This is the path of technical progress on the basis of the widespread use of new technologies and the achievements of domestic and foreign science, the path of significantly increasing labor productivity on this basis. The implementation of the resolutions of the Central Committee on industry and agriculture and the tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will ensure a new upsurge in the socialist economy of our country and will ensure the accelerated transition from socialism to communism.

III

The upsurge of the national economy of our country, the further strengthening of heavy industry, the implementation of the great measures of the Party and the government to improve agriculture, the increase in the production of consumer goods—all these are closely interconnected and, to a large extent, depend on the new upsurge of transportation.

Transportation and our entire brilliant industry, as well as the rising agriculture, have achieved great success to welcome the 20th Congress of the Party.

Although our transportation has basically met the needs of the national economy for transportation work, it is incorrect not to see the shortcomings in the work of the railways, not to see that the railway transportation is already very tense at present. The system of "rationing" the distribution of wagons among shippers has not been abolished. This tension is most evident on the railways of the Urals, Siberia, the Donbass, and their branches. And the volume of freight is still increasing.

In order to fully meet the needs of the economy for transportation, the transport workers, first of all, the railway workers, must increase the carrying capacity and throughput capacity of the lines, especially to concentrate efforts to eliminate the backwardness of transportation technology, to improve and reorganize the work of transportation.

The Central Committee has correctly and resolutely raised the issue of rapidly converting the railways to electric traction, which is the most important link in the technical reconstruction of railway transportation and the development of railway transportation on a high technological basis. In the 15-year plan for the electrification of railways that has been adopted, it is stipulated that electric locomotives will be used on the most important freight-intensive lines: from Moscow to the south and east, mountain lines, main lines with heavy passenger and freight traffic, and suburban lines of large cities.

The electrification of railways and the use of diesel locomotives are the most important factors in increasing the carrying capacity of railways. New 5,000-horsepower eight-axle electric locomotives can haul cars weighing 3,500 to 4,000 tons at a speed of 90 kilometers per hour, and on restricted grades, the speed is 42 to 43 kilometers per hour. By 1960, the share of electric and diesel traction will increase from the current 14% of all railway transportation to 40-50%.

Comrade N.S. Khrushchev has correctly criticized the leaders and workers of the railways for the backwardness in the electrification of railways and the application of new technologies.

I believe that the railway workers will accept this fair criticism of the Central Committee in a Bolshevik manner and will adopt electric traction with revolutionary enthusiasm, implement the excellent electrification plan, and ensure a new upsurge in Soviet railway transportation.

Obviously, in the process of changing the traction, all aspects of railway management must also adopt the latest technologies, otherwise, electrification will not produce full results. It is necessary to more resolutely adopt the automation of traffic management: automatic block signaling, centralized traffic control, electrification of switches, mechanization of hump yards, automatic stopping devices, radio communication, radio telegraphy at stations, etc. We now have 120,000 switchmen, and when we implement the electrification of switches, we will no longer have people doing this work, and then, along with the elimination of this profession, the saying "It's all the switchman's fault" will no longer be heard. (The hall is lively)

Centralized traffic control is the most perfect and modern technology, and with the help of this device, one dispatcher can ensure the passage of trains from one dispatcher's office, controlling the signals and switches of 15 to 20 intermediate stations on a 200-kilometer section. Almost all the traffic workers (including switchmen) at these stations will become unnecessary, and only one station master will remain.

The introduction of automatic block signaling and centralized traffic control must be combined with the development of electric and diesel traction.

There is a need for wagons with a load capacity of 100 tons and more open wagons and ordinary wagons. With the development of agriculture, the volume of transportation of vegetables, fruits, meat, and other perishable goods will significantly increase. This will require the widespread use of refrigerated trains and wagons with mechanized refrigeration equipment.

The problem of passenger wagons is very acute. Now more than 40% of the electric train wagons are old-fashioned, and there are many very old, dilapidated wagons that make passengers uncomfortable in local and suburban trains. It is necessary to draw up a plan to replace the old passenger wagons and significantly improve passenger transportation, using air conditioning devices to improve the equipment of passenger wagons.

At the same time, it is necessary to fully utilize the throughput capacity of the railways, to develop the construction of stations, double-tracking, and new railways, especially in areas with heavy freight traffic and new development. For example, by 1960, new lines should be built: Magnitogorsk-Sterlitamak-Abdulino (this will be the direct outlet for goods from South Urals and Karaganda to the west), Kurgan-West-Sverdlovsk-Krasnoufimsk (this will complement the work of the Sverdlovsk railway), the Altai region-border (a new line connecting the People's Republic of China), and other lines.

The most serious problem is the roads that limit the use of large locomotives and large freight wagons and the speed of traction. It is necessary to reconstruct the line equipment, accelerate the conversion of railways to heavy rails, and reconstruct the sand-and-gravel foundations.

The problems in water transportation are also not small. The most effective and planned coordination and interaction of various means of transportation is an important advantage of the socialist economy. In the Soviet Union, various means of transportation work as a single transportation network.

The share of transportation by relatively cheap means of transportation—waterways and pipelines—is still very low. The situation is especially unsatisfactory with the use of so-called small rivers for local transportation. Although the Volga River has been fundamentally reconstructed, and new navigation canals, reservoirs, and waterways have been built, they are used very poorly. During the navigation period, tens of millions of tons of goods are transported along the railways parallel to the Volga River and other rivers, which is an intolerable situation. Improving the use of the Northern Sea Route and increasing the volume of long-distance transportation from the Black Sea ports will provide great opportunities to reduce long-distance transportation along the railways to the Far East.

The establishment of a unified, interconnected, and interacting transportation network will help to shorten the transportation distance and reduce transportation costs, for which it is necessary to strengthen water transportation.

The leaders of the River Transport Department and the Maritime Transport Department must show greater initiative and determination to improve and reconstruct the fleet and to adopt more powerful, more perfect, and faster motor ships and passenger ships.

The work of ports and piers is the most backward aspect of water transportation, and we are even more backward in this respect than in ships. It is necessary to do more work to develop the work of ports and piers.

In automobile transportation, we have very few large trucks, especially trailers. We must adopt trucks with a greater carrying capacity, with a load capacity of 10 to 20 tons or more.

It should be said that we have very few perfect roads. The problem of developing the road network remains to be solved. Local initiative plays a great role in road construction, repair, and maintenance. It is necessary to increase the share of public transportation of automobiles, by reducing the share of departmental automobile transportation.

It is not necessary to relax the efforts to improve the use of potential in railway transportation, river transportation, sea transportation, and automobile transportation while waiting for the technical reconstruction of transportation to be implemented, otherwise we will not be able to ensure transportation.

In order to better utilize transportation, it is necessary to economize on transportation itself, to more widely and deeply utilize the advantages of our socialist economy in this matter, to ensure the improvement of the placement of productive forces and the approach of industry to the sources of raw materials and consumption regions, to ensure the comprehensive development of some regions, to strengthen the work of processing products locally. These works, together with the improvement of planning work in transportation and sales, will make it possible to eliminate unnecessary transportation, repeated transportation, long-distance transportation, and other irrational transportation. This is an important task of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

In order to complete the major tasks facing transportation, it is necessary to significantly improve the work of transportation construction, to adopt factory methods, to improve design work, to accelerate the commissioning of transportation construction projects, and, above all, to reduce construction costs.

The technical renovation of transportation will first of all produce a great effect in increasing the speed of transportation, which has great significance for the national economy.

Increasing the speed can reduce the cost of transportation, save a lot of transportation expenses, and free up more vehicles, locomotives, ships, automobiles, and, most importantly, release the carrying capacity of railways and ports to promote the transportation industry.

Increasing the speed in transportation can prevent a large amount of material resources from being in the process of transportation for a long time, accelerate the turnover of goods, bring the production regions and consumption regions closer together in time, which will help the cooperation of industry, and can obtain more products through the acceleration of the release of means of production from transportation, and save time for workers to engage in production and rest.

IV

The problem of speed and saving time has great significance for the entire national economy. Marx wrote: "Any economy is ultimately an economy of time... The economy of time, like the planned distribution of working time among different branches of production according to the number of workers, is always the first economic law based on collective production." (Marx and Engels, Collected Works, Vol. 4, p. 119.)

This has special significance under the historical conditions of realizing the great slogan put forward by Lenin: to catch up with and surpass the major capitalist countries in terms of per capita production.

In the years since this slogan was put forward, except for the war years (when the main task was to drive Hitler back to Berlin and into the grave, a task that has been brilliantly accomplished by our glorious army), we have made great progress in the task of catching up with and surpassing the major capitalist countries in terms of per capita production and reducing the gap between us in this respect.

The much higher rate of development of the Soviet national economy compared to capitalism, the laws of socialist development different from capitalism, all provide a guarantee for the completion of the task of catching up with and surpassing the major capitalist countries in terms of the economy.

The socialist economy is less wasteful than the capitalist economy, primarily because it does not have the losses in production and circulation caused by the nature of capitalism (crises, unemployment, anarchic production, and competition).

Title: The Main Tasks of the Party and the Soviet Government in the National Economy

Although we still have many losses in production and circulation, we know the methods to reduce these losses and will strive to achieve this. The method is to implement austerity measures in all areas of activity. As in the past, austerity remains the most important task for the Party, the Soviets, and the entire national economy. We must reduce non-productive expenditures, reduce management costs, streamline and improve the work of the agencies, and lower the costs of circulation and transportation that do not produce new material resources.

We must also undertake the most important and largest task, which is to save both living and materialized labor in production. This means improving the most important quality indicator of socialist production and reducing costs.

To ensure the completion of the basic economic tasks, it is necessary to achieve a labor productivity much higher than under the capitalist system.

The current propagandists of modern capitalism often advocate the slogan of increasing labor productivity on the basis of the "spirit of industrial unity" between the employer and the worker. This is an old tune repeated, because the interest of the capitalist in increasing labor productivity is not because it is a means to improve the living conditions of the whole society, but because it is a means to increase the surplus profits of capitalism.

For our socialist camp, the growth of labor productivity is of decisive importance for increasing the total output of the national economy. It is a means to improve the material well-being of the people.

Great Lenin as early as 1919 pointed out that for the victory of the new social system, the most important and principal thing is labor productivity. He believed that labor productivity is the decisive general condition for the victory of socialism, which is expressed as the new material foundation of large-scale industry. It can improve the culture, discipline, work skills of all residents, and make the organization of labor better. That is to say, labor productivity is the sum of all technical, economic, organizational, cultural, and political activities of the Party and the Soviet state.

In the relatively short historical period after Lenin raised this slogan, we have made great progress in implementing this slogan. In the period from 1913 to 1955, the labor productivity in the Soviet industry increased eightfold. If the shortening of the working day is also taken into account, it increased tenfold.

However, if all enterprises and the entire industry had fully completed the tasks of labor productivity in the previous five-year plan, our achievements would have been even greater.

To tap the existing potential for increasing labor productivity, it is of course necessary to speed up the promotion of advanced technology. The Central Committee, in summarizing the period mentioned, paid special attention to this issue: it held specialized conferences; it held conferences of active industrial workers; at the Central Committee's plenary session in July 1955, it deeply analyzed this issue; it wrote a special letter to party organizations at all levels.

During the past few five-year plans, the national economy has widely adopted new technologies, making it possible for us to mechanize the main labor-intensive work. However, even now, a large number of industrial workers are still doing manual work. This is not only because there are not enough machines and the process of manufacturing and mastering new machines and machinery is not satisfactory, but also because in many departments that are considered to be mechanized, only some of the main processes are actually mechanized.

For example, we continuously supply coal mines with machines and machinery, mainly coal-cutting combines. However, many other jobs on the working face and on the surface still have to be done by hand.

A coal-cutting combine work team has 14 people, two of whom operate the coal-cutting combine, while the other 12 people manually attend to the machinery.

In the slate industry, the main part of production has been mechanized, but three-quarters of the work has not been mechanized.

In the timber industry, the work of felling trees has been mechanized, but one sawmill worker's daily output of timber requires 20 branch workers with axes to manually remove the branches.

Therefore, the most important task in mechanization is to implement comprehensive mechanization.

The automation of production should be a major factor in increasing labor productivity. The Moscow State First Ball Bearing Factory, by adopting automatic production lines, mechanizing and automating processes, adopting advanced technological processes and new equipment, increased labor productivity by 60% during the fifth five-year plan. The total output of the factory has increased to twice the pre-war level, while the number of workers has decreased by 29%.

While promoting automatic production lines and establishing automated enterprises, we should also carry out large-scale technical reconstruction of existing enterprises, mainly by promoting new types of equipment, modernizing old equipment, or replacing them. This gives us a great opportunity to adopt fast working methods and increase labor productivity.

The task of promoting new technologies and mechanizing labor-intensive work is not only a problem for industry, transportation, and construction, but also relates to agriculture.

However, no matter how powerful the new technology is, without human labor, it becomes a dead thing. And the active role of labor on the means of production depends on the social form of labor. Whether the products produced by technical equipment are more or less depends not only on the technical equipment itself, but to a considerable extent also on the nature of labor—whether it is the enslaved hired labor of capitalist society or the free labor of socialist society.

The production relations in our country and in the countries building socialism open up broad scope for the development of social production and create conditions for the constant development of the creative initiative of the laboring masses and for the development of socialist competition. Lenin believed that organizing competition is the most important task of the state.

Socialist competition in the Soviet Union has become a national cause, and our achievements are to a great extent the result of mass socialist competition.

Despite these indisputable achievements, it would be wrong not to see the many serious shortcomings that still exist. These shortcomings hinder and will hinder the development of socialist competition to an even greater extent in the future. The main shortcomings are: in many production departments, the advanced experience of production innovators—advanced workers in socialist competition—is rarely promoted.

Sometimes from the materials, it can be seen that in terms of individual labor productivity, we are still lagging behind the United States. However, it should also be known that many innovators in our industrial and transportation departments have reached the labor productivity of the corresponding professions in the United States, and in many cases, they have even surpassed it. This proves that in the case of widespread adoption of the experience of production innovators, we can catch up with and even surpass the United States in labor productivity. However, enterprises and departments often adopt an official attitude towards the widespread adoption of innovators' methods.

The advanced coal-cutting combine operators, Comrade Buchinsky and Comrade Vilichko, and their work teams in the Karaganda coal district, increased the monthly output of a combine to 26,000 tons, which is almost three times the monthly output of a combine in the entire Karaganda coal district and almost five times the monthly output of a combine in the entire department. They achieved these results not by excessive physical labor, but by improving their combine and improving the work process. The income of these work teams is twice that of other combine work teams in Karaganda.

If the coal industry department widely promotes this advanced method, then in the coal industry, we can obtain several thousand tons of coal more per year from the working faces that use combines to mine, and the labor productivity of these workers can be increased by more than 60%.

I can give many similar examples. Now I will give just one more interesting example. I am referring to Comrade Seminsky, a turner at the "Red Excavator" factory in Kiev, who is a delegate to the 20th Party Congress.

We have such outstanding pioneers of high-speed cutting as Comrades Bikov and Portakevich, but I will only talk about Comrade Seminsky because the lathe he uses is an ordinary one, the most common in our country. He has consistently overfulfilled the quota by five to six times for 10 consecutive years. He achieved this result mainly by shortening the auxiliary time in the manufacture of parts.

The machine production time of all turners usually accounts for only 20% to 35%, while the auxiliary time accounts for 65% to 80%. Comrade Seminsky, on the other hand, has a machine production time of 65% to 70%, while the auxiliary time is only 30% to 35%. He was able to do this by adopting his own designed, not complicated but very clever auxiliary equipment and tools, which made the process of manufacturing parts mechanized and automated.

This is closely related to Comrade Seminsky's salary situation: his monthly income exceeds the average salary of turners in this Kiev factory by one and a half times.

Comrade Seminsky said in a conversation with me: If we ensure that all turners have the relevant auxiliary equipment and tools for high-speed work and create conditions for them to increase the quota, then they can all work like him, and the labor productivity of turners can be increased to two to three times.

The fact that the machine-building departments have not done anything about this noteworthy matter and have taken a dismissive attitude towards it cannot be considered forgivable. They clearly know this suggestion and other innovation suggestions, but the inertia, routine, and bureaucracy that still exist in many economic workers hinder them.

Of course, economic workers also have their own difficulties in promoting and applying the experience of innovators, but under good economic leadership, these difficulties can be completely overcome.

The application of advanced production experience should be put on the national track, and this matter should be made into a law, in line with the instructions of the great Lenin: "Make the typical force first a spiritual typical, then a compulsory typical..." ("Lenin Collected Works" Vol. 27, p. 177)

The significant growth of the technical equipment of the national economy, the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the working class, and the ever-increasing level of labor productivity determine the characteristics of the development of socialist competition in the current stage.

Under these new conditions, the production innovators themselves have grown and are no longer the same as before. Socialist competition has developed to a new, higher stage. This requires another, higher level of leadership and organization.

However, we have serious shortcomings in organizing mass socialist competition. The most serious of these shortcomings is:

The Leninist requirements for ensuring the publication and comparison of competition achievements have been violated. The work of promoting competition achievements is not done well. The situation of workers making personal commitments has decreased, which has reduced the sense of moral responsibility for the socialist commitments taken in front of the collective.

There is a lack of spiritual and material rewards for the achievements obtained in the competition. There are few forms of spiritual encouragement, and it must be said that there are few awards of medals and badges to workers who are advanced workers in the competition for outstanding achievements in production. The bonuses obtained by enterprises in the national socialist competition are often distributed incorrectly.

It is far from always correctly assessing the initiative of engineers and technicians who have spent a lot of labor to ensure that advanced workers achieve results. This shortcoming is particularly unacceptable in the current stage of the competition, as now, without the close cooperation and leadership of engineers and technicians, it is simply unimaginable for workers to achieve results in improving technology and processes, in improving labor and production organization.

The serious shortcomings in labor and production organization that hinder socialist competition are mainly:

The unevenness of work every month, even every working day, the phenomenon of rushing in the last ten days of a month, and the serious waste of working hours—on average, each worker wastes one hour, sometimes one and a half hours, and sometimes even two hours in a day in industry.

These shortcomings are particularly unacceptable at present. Our Party has adopted the important resolution to implement the seven-hour working day. We believe that every Soviet worker will respond to this historic resolution of their own Party with even greater enthusiasm to work heroically for the welfare of the motherland and the victory of communism. (Applause)

However, to turn this enthusiasm into action, it is necessary to eliminate the current serious phenomenon of wasting working hours. To eliminate these serious shortcomings, it is necessary to decisively improve the leadership of economic workers, trade union organizations, and party organizations.

Economic workers must first be responsible for ensuring that the work of enterprises is carried out normally, rhythmically, and uninterruptedly. Every economic worker should not only do technical work and organize production but should also take seriously the socialist competition and the work of people. They should actively contact the masses, party organizations, trade union organizations, and other organizations, rather than waiting for these organizations to come to them.

Every economic worker should work with party organizations and trade union organizations to improve labor discipline and, through various measures such as creating normal living conditions for workers and staff, labor protection, etc., to help eliminate the causes that often disrupt discipline.

Particular emphasis should be placed on the role of economic workers in presiding over production conferences, which are of great significance.

The nature of production conferences is determined by our socialist system. Only in our society can such a form of direct participation of the broad masses of workers in production management exist.

Economic leaders, trade union workers, party workers, innovators, and ordinary workers should meet at well-organized, regular production conferences, and they should meet here. Production conferences should become an important center for formulating organizational and technical measures to ensure increased labor productivity, reduced costs, tapping savings potential, and expanding the sources of further improvement of workers' material well-being, expanding the enterprise's fund for improving workers' living conditions.

Production conferences are and should be an important center for the dissemination, study, and adoption of advanced experience.

The direct responsibility of every economic leader, all party workers, especially trade union workers, is to actively participate in the work of production conferences, carefully study the suggestions of workers, engineers, technicians, and staff, and implement the adopted suggestions.

In addition to the above points, serious shortcomings in the planning of wages and the determination of labor norms also seriously hinder the more rapid increase of labor productivity and the development of socialist competition.

Comrade N.S. Khrushchev is right in saying that the wage issue is in a mess. We now have to try to sort it out. This is a serious task. In one region, wages are ahead, while in another region, they are lagging behind; in one department, they are ahead, while in another department, they are lagging behind; even within the same department, the wages of turners in one factory are paid according to one standard, while in another factory, they are paid according to another standard. It will take time to analyze this deeply, of course, in addition to other things, material resources are also needed. However, we should firmly handle this matter, first of all, to eliminate the most obvious shortcomings. We should start from the principle of individual material interests.

As early as the initial period of the Soviet power, Lenin pointed out the principle of making people care about the results of labor from the perspective of individual material interests and its significance for increasing labor productivity, and legally affirmed it in the orders he signed.

However, even in the current period of gradually transitioning from socialism to communism, the principle of individual material interests, which is extremely important for the socialist economic system, remains fully valid, because in this period, the law of distribution according to labor is effective.

With the improvement of productive forces, the material living standards of the working people are also improving, which is completely opposite to capitalism. Under the capitalist system, with the improvement of productive forces, the bourgeoisie becomes richer, while the proletariat becomes poorer. This is clearly and vividly stated in the works of Comrade Thorez, who introduced new materials about the poverty of the French working people.

The basic principles of wage planning in a socialist society, as stipulated by Lenin, are completely correct. These principles are still valid now, but life has progressed, and they have been modified. We must consider these modifications.

In fact, since the wage reform in 1932, we have not changed the wage system, resulting in many outdated aspects. In the specific forms of implementing this system, major modifications are also required.

The outdated nature of the wage system is the basic shortcoming of wage planning. In most departments, the wage rates, which serve as the basis for wages, are particularly outdated. The average wage of industrial department workers increased more than twofold from 1940 to 1955, while the wage rates have hardly changed.

As a result, there is a significant gap between the wages that workers have actually increased and the wage rates. To exceed the already achieved wage level, production quotas must be maintained at a low level.

Therefore, wage rates and production quotas are no longer a sufficient organizational basis for the issue of increasing labor productivity and wages, because almost half of the wages are obtained by overfulfilling quotas, bonuses, and other additional incomes. The wage grade tables, due to various additions over 20 years, contain elements of egalitarianism.

The reason why the industrial departments set unsatisfactory production quotas and the major engineering measures to adopt new equipment and technological innovations to ensure that workers complete the existing quotas are not satisfactory is that there is a gap between the very low wage rates and the actual wages.

Due to the serious shortcomings in the entire wage planning that hinder the development of labor productivity, it is urgent to conduct a detailed study and rectification, that is, to carry out so-called wage reform and labor quota reform. This is not an easy task and will take time, and it may also require funds, but this matter must be done.

Implementing the important resolution of the Central Committee to raise the wages of low-wage workers is a major task. This is of great significance for improving the living standards of these people.

As pointed out in the report of the Central Committee, when formulating the system of labor remuneration, attention must also be paid to how to make the leaders of workshops and enterprises more concerned about the results of the work of workshops and enterprises from the perspective of material interests.

The discussion of all the issues discussed in the report of the Central Committee and the discussion of the draft directive of the sixth five-year plan to be held at the congress are related to the fundamental interests of all working people in our country. It must be emphasized that several issues that have direct and personal significance for every working person will be raised and solved at this congress.

I am referring to the issues raised at the congress according to the decision of the Central Committee, such as: transition to a seven-hour working day, raising the wages of low-wage workers, significantly improving the pensions of working people, and improving the working and living conditions of women.

The draft directive of the sixth five-year plan stipulates that the actual wages of workers will increase by an average of approximately 30%; the income of collective farmers will increase by an average of at least 40%; housing construction will increase by one fold, and social and cultural construction will be further expanded.

All these decisions first of all demonstrate the victory of socialism in our country, demonstrate the indisputable superiority of the socialist system, demonstrate our victory in the Great Patriotic War, and demonstrate our achievements in the construction of communism. This is the result of the entire policy and practice of our Party to the greatest extent to satisfy the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the great Soviet people.

We have no doubt that our heroic working class, collective farmers, and all working people—the builders of communism—will respond to the care of the Party and the government with a new surge of creative initiative, strengthen the power of our motherland, and bring us closer to the victory of communism. (Prolonged applause)

Now, in our country, there are favorable objective conditions to accelerate the transition from socialism to communism. To turn these conditions into reality, the decisive factor is the subjective factor, that is, to improve the level and quality of leadership in various fields of economic and political life.

The trade union is the most mass organization of the working class, which connects our Party and the entire class, and its role is particularly great. Now, the trade union unites 42 million workers.

There is no doubt that our trade union has achieved great results in its work and has made significant contributions to the working class, the Party, and the state. It can serve as an example for the brotherly trade unions of people's democratic countries in many aspects and plays an outstanding leading role in the international labor movement.

However, it would be wrong not to see the many serious shortcomings in the work of the trade union. Overcoming the serious shortcomings in the work of the trade union will greatly enhance the role of the trade union in the construction of communism.

The July Plenary Session of the Central Committee pointed out that it is necessary to improve the work of the trade union in the following aspects: leading socialist competition, eliminating formalism in this aspect, more widely promoting the advanced experience of workers and innovators in production, strengthening labor discipline, and striving to improve labor productivity and the material well-being of workers.

Both the trade unions in enterprises and the central trade unions should show more initiative, persistence, and combativeness than now to expose and overcome the serious shortcomings in labor quotas and wage standards, in opposing the bureaucratic attitude towards the labor and life of workers, and in labor protection.

The trade union must pay more attention to labor issues and the directly related production issues. In this regard, the trade union should play a major role in production conferences and must activate and greatly improve this work.

In the entire work of the trade union, from top to bottom, there should be a Bolshevik spirit that is incompatible with the following phenomena: bureaucratic bad habits and indifference towards workers' production innovators, and towards satisfying the ever-increasing needs of workers and all laborers.

Now, more than ever, the trade union needs to actively participate in the construction of communism with action to live up to the great Lenin's definition of it as a school of communism. Lenin said that it is not an ordinary type of school, it is a school of management, a school of economic work, a school of communism. (Applause)

The brilliant victories achieved by our country before the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union once again powerfully demonstrate the great and decisive role of our Party as the main inspirer and organizer of the Soviet society that is building communism.

Party organizations should improve their leadership of the work of trade union organizations and other mass organizations, not replace them, and not reduce their responsibilities.

Party organizations should educate all economic, trade union, and Komsomol leaders and all workers to cultivate a high sense of responsibility for completing their tasks. They should make the entire organizational work and mass work of the Party to such an extent that its work can specifically affect each Communist Party member and, through Communist Party members, affect all non-party masses.

On the basis of deeply mastering production technology and production management, party organizations should lead and guide the ever-increasing creative initiative and activism of workers, collective farmers, and the people's intellectuals, lead them to carry out socialist competition, adopt and better utilize new technologies and methods of innovators, improve productivity, reduce the labor of the Soviet people, and improve their material and cultural well-being.

The close, inseparable connection with the masses, the ability to listen to the voice of the masses and discern their urgent needs, not only educating the masses but also learning from the masses, all these have been and remain one of the most important sources of the strength and invincibility of our Party. A good Bolshevik should first of all be a good mass worker.

The summary report of the Central Committee on the work of the period is a vivid example of connecting with life and the masses, being able to reflect and realize their creative initiative and wishes.

Although the Party and the government have achieved certain results in improving and streamlining state agencies, there are still serious shortcomings in state agencies. The main shortcomings are: a part of the leaders of state agencies are not well connected with the masses and life, and there is a bureaucratic style.

Efforts should be made to achieve this: the leaders from the departments to the enterprises, collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms should more frequently go to the production sites, meet with workers and collective farmers, and answer the sharp questions they are interested in and concerned about. In this way, the leaders themselves will more sharply raise the problems in their own work.

I would also like to point out an important issue I consider important. There are serious shortcomings in handling the letters and appeals of workers. It is necessary to ensure that leaders receive workers, read their letters, appeals, and application forms, and handle them sharply and effectively.

Soviet people, working people, have been and remain the center of attention of our Party. Apart from the interests of the people, apart from the struggle for the happiness of all working people, the Party has no and cannot have any other interests. It is precisely for this reason that the people love, support, and will always support their dear Communist Party. (Prolonged applause)

Our country and the various departments of economic construction have many excellent cadres who are infinitely loyal to the Party and the people. This is our great achievement and is also one of the most important guarantees for successfully completing the tasks we face in the sixth five-year plan. Now, we must make greater efforts to improve the quality of these cadres, improve their technical, political, and economic knowledge level.

Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's summary report sharply raised the issue of strengthening the ideological work of the Party, eliminating the phenomenon of the separation of theory and practice, which has great significance in this regard. Correcting the existing shortcomings in this aspect according to the spirit of the requirements of the Central Committee will undoubtedly achieve results. Cadres will improve their theoretical level and will more successfully solve the tasks of building communism. Theory will benefit from this, it will be enriched with new experience, the practice of building communism, and practice will also benefit from this, it will be better explained by theory.

The summary report of the Central Committee is made at a high theoretical level, which fully reflects the work of the Central Committee in the period mentioned and the entire life of the Party.

Everyone knows that the Central Committee has studied and raised a series of major issues with principles and theoretical significance in this period, such as the path of further development of heavy industry in our country, the evaluation of the current stage of building communism, the issue of international policy, and other issues.

After the 19th Party Congress, the Central Committee boldly (I mean bold in terms of ideology, principles, and theory) raised the issue of fighting against the cult of personality. This is not a simple issue. However, the Central Committee gave a correct, Marxist-Leninist, and principled answer to this issue. The cult of personality is a harmful cult that reduces the role of the masses, the Party, and its leaders.

Exposing the cult of personality, correctly and Marxist-Leninistically understanding the role of the people, the Party and its leaders, and the role of the leader, has great significance for strengthening the unity of the Party. The struggle against the cult of personality is an extremely important factor in the formation of the collective leadership of our Party.

The collective leadership of the Party ensures the correctness of leadership, ensures a comprehensive and profound analysis of all major issues in the life of the Party and the state, and a Leninist solution.

The most important thing is that the collective leadership of the Party is unity and solidarity on the basis of Party spirit, principles, and Marxism-Leninism.

The restoration of the Leninist norms of Party life promotes and will further promote the strengthening of the unity of the Party. This norm is formulated according to the decades of struggle of the Party and is the basis of the entire activity of the Party—the main inspirer and organizer of the Soviet society that is building communism victoriously. (Applause)

Comrades! The characteristic of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is that it is possible to plan an action program to create abundant industrial and food products in the shortest historical period on the basis of the level already achieved, and to plan a program to accelerate the transition from socialism to communism.

Therefore, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union marks a new, higher stage in the struggle of our Party to realize the brilliant plan of building a communist society by the great Lenin. The 20th Congress will be recorded in the history of the Party as the Congress of the builders of the victory of communism. (Stormy applause)

The summary report of the Central Committee and the draft directive of the 20th Congress on the sixth five-year plan open up a magnificent prospect of accelerating the progress of our country in technology, economy, society, culture, and scientific life, increasing the welfare of the Soviet people, and strengthening the power of the socialist state. This prospect will further enhance the reputation of our Party and our motherland in the hearts of the people of the world, and it will arouse reasonable patriotic pride and joy in the hearts of every Communist Party member and every Soviet citizen. (Applause)

This Soviet patriotism is inseparable from our proletarian internationalism, because we are building communism in close, brotherly cooperation with the great Chinese people, with the working people of the people's democratic countries, and with the sympathy and support of the working people of the world. (Applause)

During the period mentioned in the summary report, the strength of our Party, the strength of the Party's leadership, has been tested again and again. This test shows that the people have a loyal, united, and Leninist Party. The Party has a strong, united, battle-tested, and Leninist Central Committee, which is worthy of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union. (Prolonged applause)

Under the leadership of the Leninist Central Committee, our great, united, and invincible Party, and under the leadership of the Party, the heroic Soviet people will achieve the complete victory of communism. (Stormy applause) (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 25)

### 卡冈诺维奇在苏共代表大会上的发言

专栏：

    卡冈诺维奇在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！中央委员会的总结报告的意义，以及第二十次代表大会本身的意义，远远地超出了党的范围，超出了我们国家的范围。这是因为我们的党领导着强大的苏维埃国家，这个国家在国际政治上起着巨大的作用，并且对世界事件的进程起着越来越大的决定性的影响。这还因为第二十次代表大会是在这样的情况下召开的，即苏联人民在我们党的领导下所进行的共产主义建设进入了新的最重要的阶段。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫所做的中央委员会的工作总结报告，明显地和令人信服地说明了我们强大的、为人民所爱戴的布尔什维克党具有何等的无穷尽的创造力量。（掌声）
    总结报告所谈到的时期，在我们的党和国家的生活中是复杂的艰巨的时期。
    必须回想一下：在第十九次代表大会召开后不久，苏联的敌人、共产主义的敌人、和平的敌人，曾经有过阴险的打算，他们指望我们的党及其领导机构中发生危机，指望工人阶级和农民之间、我们多民族国家的各民族之间发生纠纷。
    现在，全世界都可以看见，帝国主义的老板们以及歇斯底里的占卜者又一次彻底破产了。
    在第二十次代表大会召开的时候，伟大的拥有700万党员的党，团结得像一个整体，而且紧密地团结在列宁主义的中央委员会及其坚持执行集体领导原则的主席团周围。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    工人阶级和集体农民的联盟和我国各族人民的友谊不可估量地增强了。苏联人民更加紧密地团结在我们党的周围。
    依靠久经考验的布尔什维克的方法——大胆地批评和自我批评，党及其中央委员会，正确地解决了尖锐地摆在党和国家面前的极其巨大而复杂的问题。
    挑拨离间的贝利亚法西斯匪帮的罪恶活动被大胆而坚决地揭露和清算了。从而党和苏维埃国家也就更为巩固。
    工业的发展和人民需要的增长同农业落后之间的严重不均衡现象，已经被极有原则性地而且真正详尽地揭露了。关于改善农业情况的措施已经制定出来，而且已经在某种程度上实行了。
    关于工业、运输业和农业中技术进步的问题，已经提到新的高度。关于改善工业中的情况和消灭工业中缺点的措施已经制定出来。在用马克思列宁主义观点估计现代条件和环境的基础上，苏联在对外政策和争取和平的斗争中大胆地发挥了巨大的积极的首创精神。
    第二十次代表大会所作的主要总结是，苏联各族人民在党的领导下，并且依靠国家工业化和农业集体化的成就，顺利地提前完成了第五个发展国民经济的五年计划。
    在提高人民物质福利和胜利地进行共产主义建设的事业中，又跨进了一大步。
    伟大的中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家——波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国，同强大的社会主义阵营的主导力量——苏联之间的永恒的兄弟友谊的联系日益巩固。苏维埃国家在争取全世界和平、安全和各国人民之间的友谊的斗争中，获得了巨大的胜利。
    党的最高机构——第二十次代表大会，具有一切理由十分满意地赞同胜利地领导党和全体人民沿着伟大列宁的道路前进的党中央委员会的活动。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    一
    中央委员会的总结报告提供了一幅明显的图画，并且对党在争取普遍和平、国际安全、各国人民的友谊的斗争中，在争取各国（不管这些国家的社会制度和政治制度如何）和平共处的斗争中所获得的巨大成就，进行了深刻的马克思主义的分析。
    我们对外政策的胜利是中央委员会正确和一贯地执行列宁的英明政策的结果。
    我们党的对外政策的力量就在于，它是极其科学的，它是以列宁对垂死的腐朽的资本主义——帝国主义的分析为基础的。我们的党和政府揭示了世界经济和政治发展的规律性，估计了国际舞台上阶级力量对比的变化，及时地提出和顺利地解决了一个又一个新的任务，保障了苏联和整个社会主义阵营地位的加强，这也就意味着帝国主义地位的削弱。
    我们党和苏维埃国家的伟大领袖弗·伊·列宁指出：由于十月革命的胜利，世界分裂为两个对立的体系——社会主义体系和资本主义的体系，在此之后，世界政治将沿着两条路线发展：一条路线表现出，历史上必然灭亡的剥削阶级力图保持对“自己”国家的工人阶级和劳动群众的统治，力图使其他国家的被奴役和被压迫的人民继续处于从属地位。
    另一条路线表现出，工人阶级和被压迫的人民坚决要求用新社会来代替以剥削、奴役、压迫（产生战争、危机、失业、群众的贫穷和饥饿的根源）为基础的旧社会，在新社会中，摆脱了社会压迫和民族压迫的、自由和独立的各国人民，将在和平、兄弟般合作、互相尊重和互相帮助的基础上发展自己的关系。
    伟大的无产阶级导师卡·马克思曾经科学地证明：这样的社会不可避免地要建立起来。他写道：“旧社会中有经济上的贫困和政治上的胡作胡为，与旧社会相反的新社会将产生出来，新社会的国际原则是和平，因为每一国的人民都有一个相同的统治者——劳动！”（卡·马克思和弗·恩格斯选集俄文版第1卷第449页）
    世界事件的全部发展证实了科学共产主义奠基者的预见的正确性。这一点在中央委员会向第二十次代表大会所作的总结报告中又得到了新的证明。
    在党的第十九次和第二十次代表大会之间的这个时期中，苏联的国际威信及其对世界事件进程的影响大大地增长，以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的社会主义阵营各国的国际地位愈益巩固了。同南斯拉夫的友谊的、兄弟般的关系已经恢复了。
    另一方面，资本主义的总危机愈益尖锐，帝国主义的殖民制度即将全部崩溃。
    世界舞台上的根本变化，为加强争取各个不同的社会制度和政治制度的国家之间的和平共处、为防止战争的斗争，开创了最有利的前途和条件。
    因此，在尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫所作的中央委员会的总结中，创造性地而不是教条式地、辩证地而不是形而上学地运用了马克思列宁主义，估计了已经发生的变化，正确地从新的角度来考察一些最重要的问题。这些问题包括关于和平共处、防止战争的可能性、关于过渡到社会主义的形式和道路等问题。所有这些问题都是彼此紧密地联系在一起的。
    战争与和平的问题具有决定性的意义，因为它对于地球上各个角落的曾经在20世纪经历过两次世界大战的千百万人们来说，是一个迫切的极其重要的问题。
    不言而喻，我们仍然是站在马克思列宁主义的阶级立场上来理解产生战争的原因、特别是在帝国主义条件下产生战争的原因这一问题的。
    苏维埃国家，按其阶级性来说，是和带有下列目的而力求发动战争的企图不相容的，这些目的就是想用武力使各国人民服从自己的思想体系和社会—政治制度，想用武力来解决国际上争执的问题，尤其是想侵占他国领土和奴役他国人民。
    至于谈到帝国主义，按其本性来说，就具有产生战争的性质。但是，它的这种性质也不是随时显露出来的，因为它产生了制止它大发兽性而且必要时将要消灭它的这种性质的敌对者——工人阶级。
    各国人民是拦住发动新战争道路的决定性力量。这一力量的比重，各国人民要求和平的意志，他们不容许发动新的毁灭性的世界战争的决心，在最近一个时期中无比地增长了。因此，从现时代力量对比中得出的关于战争并不是注定不可避免的这一结论，是绝对正确的。我们深信，如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固！
  （掌声）
    同时，各国人民，首先是苏联人民应该估计到帝国主义反动势力的冒险性质，因此，必须保持最大的警惕性。
    我们要揭露帝国主义的反动侵略势力，我们要进行争取裁军的斗争，如果暂时不能达成裁军的协议，我们要加强我们祖国的国防力量，改善我们英勇的武装部队，要使苏联越来越成为普遍和平、安全和各国人民的友谊的强大而可靠的堡垒，上面这些事做得愈好，我们所力求的制止战争的可能性也就愈加现实。（经久不息的掌声）
    苏联、中华人民共和国，印度共和国等等互相之间有着紧密的兄弟友谊联系的大国人民，共同起来争取各国不问社会制度和政治制度的不同而和平共处这件事，具有历史性的意义。
    列宁在其论文“宁肯少些，但要好些”中分析了世界发展的远景，他在33年前就写道：“斗争的结局，归根到底取决于俄国、印度、中国等等构成世界人口绝大多数的这种情形，正是这世界人口的大多数，最近几年来非常迅速地卷入谋自身解放的斗争，所以在这个意义上讲来，关于世界斗争问题的最终解决，不能有丝毫的怀疑。所以在这个意义上讲来，社会主义的最后胜利是完全和绝对有了保证的。”（列宁全集，第33卷，第458页）
    现在全世界都看到：人类天才弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的预言，是如何地被证实了。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    如果列宁能看到，印度的人民如何地欢迎社会主义苏维埃国家的使节赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志，看到苏联、中华人民共和国和印度共和国在政治上是如何的接近，他一定很高兴地说：“这就是我所希望的”。（掌声）
    资本主义国家内部的阶级矛盾日益尖锐，工人阶级和广大人民群众不仅是争取自己经济利益，而且是反对军备竞赛、争取和平、争取缓和国际关系上的紧张局势的斗争正在日益加强。这具有重要的意义。
    工人阶级要求团结，要求一切爱国的和民主的力量在维护民族独立和拒绝隶属于外国帝国主义的基础上联合起来的趋向日益增长。这一切在法国和意大利表现得特别明显，那里共产党在议会的选举中取得了光辉的胜利，我们的党和全体苏联人民为此而衷心地高兴！（掌声）
    和往常一样，我们站在自己的革命的阶级立场上，社会主义必然地要代替资本主义，只有社会主义才能使人民从剥削、压迫、贫穷、战争、危机、失业等悲惨现象中解放出来。
    但是关于过渡到社会主义的形式问题，应当按照各国不同的情况并且要估计到新的历史经验，而具体地加以解决。
    这是中国和人民民主国家的伟大经验。这些国家的人民政权在胜利地建设社会主义，它们依靠无产阶级和劳动群众的群众性革命运动，同时采用议会的形式，并且以新的内容——人民民主来充实这些形式。苏联人民和我们的党对于我们兄弟的历史性的胜利，感到衷心的喜悦。这一点的保证就是工人阶级及其革命的先锋队在政治上的领导这种决定性的条件。（掌声）
    所有这些之所以可能，是因为社会主义在苏联获得了胜利。现在，几乎占有人口总数一半的国家成为社会主义的堡垒，这就为个别国家在一定的条件下不通过国内战争而从资本主义向社会主义的过渡，创造了有利条件。
    同时，我们认为通过取得稳固多数的方法利用议会形式是可能的，但这一稳固多数要依靠无产阶级（它以其革命先锋队为首对所有群众实行政治领导）的群众革命运动。
    在现时代的历史条件下，列宁的战略原则和策略原则，特别是在他的著名著作“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”中所叙述的原则，具有特殊的意义。
    列宁教导共产党员说，“要善于把共产主义总的和基本的原则，应用到本国各阶级和各政党相互关系底特殊情况上去，应用到本国走向共产主义的客观发展中的特殊情况上去，这种特殊情况在各国是互不相同的，我们应该善于研究、探索和猜度这种特殊情况。”他还强调指出，必须“要善于把所有一切新旧形式变为共产主义获得完全的和最后的、坚决的和彻底的胜利所运用的武器”。（列宁全集第31卷第69—70页，第83页）
    中央委员会总结报告中对目前国际发展上的一些根本问题的提法，不仅是对我们党，就是对各兄弟共产党和工人党都有理论上的意义和政治实践上的意义。
    只要考虑到已经起变化的国际局势，依靠着工人阶级日益增长的要求团结一致的力量，依靠着一切真正的民主进步力量要求团结起来为民族独立、社会进步、和平和反对战争而奋斗的愿望，我们的兄弟党是能够取得重大的成就的。
    我衷心地预祝兄弟共产党和工人党在争取工人阶级的团结方面，在它们为和平和社会主义而进行的崇高奋斗方面取得成就。
  （掌声）
    可以毫不怀疑地说，中央委员会的总结报告中所提出的，赫鲁晓夫同志所阐述的一些根本问题一定会得到第二十次党代表大会的支持。第二十次代表大会的这种决定一定会大大加强我们党和苏维埃国家在争取和平共处，争取防止战争，争取世界各国人民友好，争取工人阶级团结一致为社会主义而奋斗的斗争中的地位。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    二
    同志们！我们之所以巩固了和改善了我们的国际环境，还由于我们依靠了高度发展的工业，首先就最现代化的国防用产品生产来说，我们没有落后，而且在某些方面甚至超过了美国。其次，我们巩固了国内的政治情况，在发展农业和工业方面获得了重大的成就。
    中央委员会在第十九次党代表大会以后，根据布尔什维克的原则精神，毅然制订了、通过了、并且实现着一系列在农业方面具有历史意义的重大的决定。中央召开了四次全体会议来研究谷物和畜牧业增产的问题，开垦生荒地和熟荒地的问题以及进一步加强集体农庄和国营农场的问题。
    党和政府之所以要集中人力和物力来保证农业的巨大增涨，是因为在战时受到破坏的农业处在困难的情况之下。
    中央委员会在第十九次党代表大会以后采取的一切措施中，意义特别重大的是关于开垦大片的生荒地和熟荒地的决定、关于增派干部巩固集体农庄的决定和其他的决定。由于采取了一系列的经济措施，大大提高了集体农民在增加集体农庄生产上的物质利益。党巩固了列宁的工农联盟。
    机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员现在是我国工人阶级的一支相当庞大的队伍。机器拖拉机站本身已经大大地加强了，装备了大量先进的技术。第六个五年计划规定要大力增加农业的技术装备，这个任务无论如何必须完成。
    现在中央提出的主要任务是，大力提高所有集体农庄和国营农场的单位面积产量，特别是在人口稠密的地区。必须大量增加供给农业的矿质肥料的数量，因此，应该提高化学工业的作用。这些问题在实行五年计划的过程中也还要加以研究，以便超额完成任务。
    党和党中央进行了非常重大的工作：派遣了约三万个能力强的工作人员去担任落后集体农庄管理委员会的主席，以便加强集体农庄。
    在为集体化而斗争的时期中，派到农村去的25，000个工人和机器拖拉机站和国营农场政治部的工作人员大都是政治组织者。而现在派到农村去的工作人员，除了有政治经验以外，还具有工程技术和农学知识。必须继续全力支持他们，提高他们的业务水平，不失去同他们的联系，这样，党的这项最重要的组织措施一定能在社会主义农业进一步高涨的事业中产生成果。
    在工业方面，党中央和政府在总结所谈到的时期内制定了和实行了一系列重大的措施，这些措施保证了胜利地完成和超额完成第十九次党代表大会规定的第五个五年计划的任务。
    苏共中央1955年7月全体会议的决定具有特别重大的意义。决议指出了一条有原则意义的道路：进一步发展社会主义工业，特别是作为发展整个经济、巩固国防力量、提高农业和发展消费品工业的不可动摇的基础的重工业。
    这是在广泛采用新技术和国内外的科学成就的基础上使技术进步的道路，是在这个基础上大大提高劳动生产率的道路。实现中央关于工业和农业的决议以及第六个五年计划的各项任务，就能够保证我国社会主义经济的新的高涨，保证我国加速由社会主义过渡到共产主义。
    三
    我国国民经济的高涨，重工业进一步的强大发展，党和政府对提高农业的巨大措施的实施，消费品生产的增加，——社会主义经济全面的高涨是互相密切联系着的，而且在很大的程度上取决于运输业的新高涨。
    运输业和我国整个光辉的工业以及高涨的农业一样，以巨大的成就迎接了第二十次党代表大会。
    虽然，我国的运输业基本上满足了国民经济对运输工作的需要，但是，要是看不到铁路工作中的缺点，看不到铁路运输在目前就已经非常紧张的情况，那是不正确的。在发货人之间分配车皮的“配给”制度仍未取消。这种紧张情况首先表现在乌拉尔、西伯利亚、顿巴斯等铁路上，以及这些铁路的支线上。而货运量还在源源不绝地增加之中。
    为了完全满足经济对运输的需要，运输工作人员、首先是铁路工作人员必须提高线路的运输能力和通过能力，特别应当集中力量，努力消灭运输业上技术落后的状况，改进和改组运输业的工作。
    党中央坚决正确地提出了急速把铁路改为利用电力牵引的问题，这是在高度技术基础上对铁路运输进行技术改造和发展铁路运输的最重要的环节。在已经通过的铁路电气化的15年计划中规定要在下列最重要的货运频繁的线路上采用电力机车牵引：由莫斯科至南方和东方的线路，山区线路，客运和货运频繁的干线，大城市郊区干线。
    铁路电气化和内燃机车的采用是提高铁路运输能力的最重要的因素。5，000匹马力的新式的八轴电气机车能牵引重3，500吨到4，000吨的车皮以90公里的时速行驶，在限制坡度上的速度每小时为42至43公里。到1960年，电气机车牵引和内燃机车牵引的程度将由现在全部铁路运输量的14％增加到40％至50％。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志根据铁路电气化和在应用新技术方面所存在的落后状况对铁路工作的领导人和工作人员进行了正确的批评。
    我相信，铁路员工们会以布尔什维克的态度来接受中央这个公正的批评，会以革命的热情来采用电气机车牵引，实现卓越的电气化计划，保证苏联铁路运输的新高涨。
    显然，在改变牵引动力的同时，铁路管理的各个方面也必须采用最新的技术，否则，电气化便不能获得充分的效果。必须更坚决地采用管理行车的自动化装置：自动闭塞装置，调度集中化，电气化道岔集中，驼峰编组场机械化，自动停车装置，无线电通讯，站场无线电传真等。我们现在共有12万个扳道员，当我们实现了岔道电气化以后，我们就不会有做这些工作的人了，那时，随着这门职业的取消，“全是扳道员的错”这句谚语也就不会有人再讲了。（全场活跃）
    调度集中装置是最完善的和最新的技术，一个调度员依靠这种装置，就可以从一个调度所保证列车的通过，操纵两百公里线段上15个到20个中间站的信号和道岔的转换。几乎所有这些站上的交通工作人员（包括扳道员）都将成为不必要，而只剩下一个站长。
    采用自动闭塞装置和调度集中装置必须同电力牵引和内燃机牵引的发展配合起来。
    需要载重量达100吨的车箱和更多的敞车和普通车箱。随着农业的发展，蔬菜、水果、肉类和其他易腐的货物的运输量将大大提高。这将需要广泛采用冷藏列车和有机械化冷却装置的车箱。
    关于客车车箱的问题是很尖锐的。现在有40％以上的电车车箱是旧式的，在地方和市郊的列车中有许多很旧的、使旅客感到不舒适的破烂车箱。必须订出计划来更换陈旧的客车车箱并且大力改善旅客运输工作，用调节空气的装置来改进客车车箱的设备。
    同时必须发挥铁路的通过能力，开展车站、复轨以及新铁路的建设工作，特别是在运货紧张和新开发的地区必须这样做。例如，1960年应该建成的新路线有：马格尼托哥尔斯克——斯捷利塔马克——阿勃杜利诺线（它将是南乌拉尔和卡拉干达的货物运往西部的直接出路），库尔干——西纳尔斯卡雅——克拉斯诺乌菲姆斯克线（它配合斯维德洛夫铁路的工作），阿拉木图区——国境线（联接中华人民共和国的新路线）和其他路线。
    使大型机车和大型装货车箱的采用以及牵引速度受到限制的道路，是最严重的问题。必须改建线路设备，加速把铁路改为重轨，把混砂的地基改建为碎石的地基。
    水路运输方面的问题也不小。各种运输工具能够最有效地、有计划地配合和相互作用，是社会主义经济的一个重要的优点。在苏联，各种运输工具作为一个统一的运输网在进行工作。
    用比较便宜的运输工具——水路和输送管进行输送的比重还是很低的。利用所谓小河来进行地方输送的情况特别不能令人满意。
    虽然伏尔加河进行了根本的改建，而新建的航行运河、水库和水路都利用得十分不够。在通航期间，千万吨货物利用同伏尔加河和其他河流平行的铁路运输，这是不能容忍的情况。改善北极水路的利用情况和增加从黑海港口作长距离运输的运货量，将提供很大的可能性来减少沿着铁路运往远东这样远距离的运输。
    建立统一的相互联系的和相互作用的运输网，将有助于缩短运送的路程和减低运费，要做到这一点就必须加强水路运输。
    河运部和海运部的领导人员必须拿出更大的积极性和决心，来改善和改建船队以及采用运输力更大的、更完善的和速度更快的机动货船和客船。
    港口和码头的工作是水路运输中最落后的方面，我们在这一方面甚至比在船只方面更加落后。必须做更多的工作来发展港口和码头的工作。
    在汽车运输中我们的大型汽车很少，特别是拖车更少。我们必须采用运输力更大的、载重为10到20吨以上的货车。
    应该说，我们的完善的公路还少。发展公路网的问题还待解决。在筑路、修路和养路工作方面，地方的主动性有很大的意义。必须提高公共使用的汽车的运输量的比重，方法是减少部门使用的汽车运输量。
    不应该因为等待实现运输的技术改建而放松为争取在铁路运输、河运、海运和汽车运输中改善利用潜力的情况而继续努力，否则我们将不能够保证运输。
    为了更好地利用运输，就必须对运输本身实行节约，必须在运输本身的节约这件事上更广泛地和更深入地利用我们社会主义经济的优越性，保证改善生产力的配置以及使工业更接近原料的来源和消费地区，保证一些地区的全面发展，加强在当地进行加工产品的工作。这些工作再加上运输和销售的计划工作的改进，就有可能来消灭对流运输、重复运输、过远运输以及其他不合理的运输。这是第六个五年计划的一个重大的任务。
    为了完成运输所面临的重大任务，必须大力改善运输建设的工作，采用工厂化方法，改善设计工作，加速动用运输建设工程，而主要的是要降低建设成本。
    运输的技术革新首先会在提高运输速度方面产生很大的效果，这点有很大的国民经济意义。
    提高速度可以降低运输的成本，节省很多的运输开支，并且腾出更多的车辆、机车、船只、汽车以及特别重要的是抽出铁路和港口的输送能力来推进交通事业。
    在运输中速度的提高，可以使大批的物质资源不致长期处在流通过程中，加速商品周转，在时间上使生产地区和消费地区接近起来，从而有助于工业的协作，可以通过从运输中加速腾出生产资料的办法而得到更多的产品，在客运中节省出时间来给劳动者进行生产劳动和休息。
    四
    速度问题和节省时间的问题对整个国民经济都有很大的意义。马克思写道：“任何节约归根结底都是节约时间……节约时间，正与按不同生产部门按计划分配工作时间一样，始终是以集体生产为基础的第一条经济规律。”（马克思、恩格斯文集，第4卷，第119页。）
    这一点在实现伟大的列宁所提出的这样一个口号的历史条件下具有特别重大的意义，列宁的口号是：要在经济方面，即在按人口计算的产量方面赶上和超过各主要资本主义国家。
    在提出这一口号以来的年代里，除战争时期以外（当时的主要任务是要把希特勒赶回柏林，把他赶进坟墓，这个任务已经由我们光荣的军队出色地完成了。）我们在实现要使按人口计算的产量方面赶上和超过各主要资本主义国家、缩短我们在这方面落后于它们的距离这个任务方面，有了很大的进展。
    比资本主义国家高得多的苏联国民经济的发展速度，不同于资本主义的社会主义发展规律，都为完成从经济上赶上和超过主要资本主义国家这个任务提供了保证。
    社会主义经济比资本主义经济的浪费要少，这首先因为它在生产和流通中没有由于资本主义本质（危机、失业、生产无政府状态和竞争）而带来的损失。
    虽然我们在生产和流通中还有许多损失，但是我们知道减少损失的办法，并且将胜利地争取减少和消除损失，办法就是在一切活动领域中实行节约制度。和过去一样，节约制度仍然是党、苏维埃机关和整个国民经济的工作的最主要的任务。我们要减少非生产开支、减少管理费用，精简和改善机关的工作，降低不生产新的物质资料的流通和运输费用。
    我们还应当做一件最重要、最巨大的工作，那就是在生产中节约活的和物化的劳动，也就是要提高社会主义生产的最重要的质量指标，降低成本。
    要保证完成基本经济任务，就非要达到比资本主义制度下高得多的劳动生产率不可。
    现代资本主义的鼓吹者目前常常宣扬这样一个口号：在企业主和工人的“工业中团结的精神”的基础上提高劳动生产率。这又是旧调重弹，因为提高劳动生产率之所以使资本家感到兴趣，并不是因为它是改善整个社会的生活的手段，而是因为它是增加资本主义的超额利润的手段。
    对我们社会主义阵营来说，劳动生产率的增长对增加国民经济总产量具有决定的意义，它是提高人民物质福利的手段。
    伟大的列宁早在1919年就已经说过，要使新的社会制度得到胜利，最重要、最主要的就是劳动生产率。他认为劳动生产率是社会主义胜利的决定性的总的条件，是表现为大工业的新物质基础的总和，它能提高全体居民的文化、纪律、工作技能和使劳动组织得更好，这就是说，劳动生产率就是党和苏维埃国家全部技术、经济、组织、文化和政治活动的总和。
    在列宁宣布这个口号以后比较短的一个历史时期中，我们在实现这一口号方面已经有了很大的进展。在1913年到1955年这段时间中，苏联工业中的劳动生产率增长到八倍，如果连工作日的缩短算在一起，则增加到了十倍。
    然而，假如一切企业和整个工业在上个五年计划中全部完成了劳动生产率方面的任务的话，那我们的成就还会更大些。
    要发掘提高劳动生产率的现有潜力，当然必须更快地推广先进技术。中央委员会在总结所谈到的时期中特别着重地注意了这个问题：召开了专业会议；召开了工业工作者积极分子会议；在中央1955年7月全会上深刻地分析了这个问题；专门给各级党组织写了一封信。
    在过去几个五年计划期间国民经济大量采用了新技术。这使得我们有可能把主要的费力工作机械化。然而，直到现在还有大量产业工人在作手工工作。这不仅是因为机械不够，以及制造和掌握新机器和机械的工作的进程不能令人满意，而且还因为在许多被认为已经机械化了的部门中，实际上机械化了的只是某些主要工序。
    例如，我们不断供应煤矿以机器和机械，首先是采煤联合机。但是工作面中和地面上的许多其他工作还要用手工来做。
    采煤联合机的工作队有14个人，其中两个人开采煤联合机，而12个人则用手工照顾机械。
    石板工业中生产的主要部分机械化了，但四分之三的工作没有机械化。
    在木材工业中，采伐林木的工作已经机械化了，而一个锯木工一天采伐的林木，要20个砍枝工拿着斧头用手工砍去树枝。
    所以，我们在机械化方面的最重要的任务就是实行全盘机械化。
      生产自动化应该是提高劳动生产率的一个很大的要素。莫斯科国家第一球轴承制造厂由于采用了自动作业线、实行了工序的机械化和自动化、采用了先进的工艺规程和新的装备，工厂中的劳动生产率在第五个五年计划中提高了60％，这个工厂的总产值已经增加到战前的两倍，而工人人数则减少了29％。
    在推广自动作业线和建立自动化企业的同时，我们应当对现有企业进行大规模的技术改造，首先是推广新型的设备，把旧的设备加以现代化，或者换掉它们。这使我们有很大可能来采用快速工作法和提高劳动生产率。
    推广新技术、使沉重费力的劳动机械化的任务，不单是工业、运输业、建筑业方面的问题，而且也同农业有关。
    五
    但是，新的技术不管它怎样强大，要是没有人的劳动，它就成了死的东西。而劳动对生产资料起积极作用是取决于劳动的社会形式。技术设备生产出的产品是多还是少，不仅取决于技术设备本身，而在颇大程度上还取决于劳动的性质——是资本主义社会的被奴役的雇佣劳动，还是社会主义社会的自由劳动。
    我们国家和正在建设社会主义的国家的生产关系，为发展社会生产开辟了广阔的活动余地，并且为经常开展劳动人民群众本身的劳动的创造性积极性、为发展社会主义竞赛创造了条件。列宁认为，组织竞赛是国家的最重要的任务。
    社会主义竞赛在苏联已经成为全民的事业，而我们的成就在很大程度上是群众性的社会主义竞赛的结果。
    尽管有这些无可争辩的成绩，然而不看到还存在着的许多严重缺点，那就不对了。这些缺点阻碍着，并且今后还可能更多地阻碍社会主义竞赛的发展。主要的缺点在于：在许多生产部门中很少推广生产革新者——社会主义竞赛中的先进工作者的先进经验。
    有时候从材料上可以看出，在个人劳动生产率方面，我们还落后于美国。但是也要知道这个事实：我们许多工业和运输部门的生产革新者已经达到了美国相应职业的劳动生产率，而在许多情况下并且超过了。这证明在广泛采用生产革新者的经验的情况下，我们在劳动生产率方面能够赶上并且超过美国。但是企业和部往往用官僚主义的态度对待大规模采用革新者的方法的事情。
    卡拉干达煤区的先进采煤联合机操使者布钦斯基同志和维利奇科同志以及他们的工作队，使一台联合机的每月产量达到二万六千吨，就是说比整个卡拉干达煤区每架联合机的每月产量几乎多到三倍，比整个部的每台联合机的每月产量几乎多到五倍。他们得到这种成绩，并不是靠他们过度的体力劳动，而是靠改善自己的联合机和改进工作过程。这些工作队的收入要比卡拉干达的其他联合机工作队多一倍。
    如果煤炭工业部广泛地推广这种先进的方法，那末在煤炭工业方面，我们每年单从用联合机开采的工作面方面就可多获得数千万吨煤，而这些工人的劳动生产率可以提高60％以上。
    我可以举出不少类似的例子。现在我只再举一个有趣的例子。我指的是基辅“红色挖掘机”工厂的车工谢明斯基同志，他是第二十次党代表大会的代表。
    我们有像比科夫同志和波尔特开维奇同志这些高速切削的卓越的先进创始者，但我单讲谢明斯基同志，是因为他所使用的车床是普通的在我国最常见的车床。他已经连续10年经常超额完成定额五倍到六倍。他达到这种成绩，主要是靠在制造零件时缩短辅助时间。
    所有车工的机器生产时间常常只占20％到35％，而辅助时间则占65％到80％。谢明斯基同志则相反，他的机器生产时间占65％到70％，而辅助时间只占30％到35％。他之所以能够这样，是由于采用了自己设计的并不复杂但很灵巧的附加设备和工具，这些设备和工具使制造零件的过程成了机械化和自动化。
    与此有紧密联系的是谢明斯基同志的工资情况：他每月的收入超过了基辅这个工厂中的车工平均工资一倍半。
    谢明斯基同志在和我谈话的时候说：如果保证全体车工得到有关的快速工作的附加设备和工具，并且为他们创造提高定额的工作条件，那末他们每一个人都能像他一样工作，而车工的劳动生产率也可以提高到两倍至三倍。
    对这一值得注意的事情首先机器制造业各部就没有做什么事并且抱着忽视的态度，这不能认为是可以宽恕的。它们清楚地知道这个建议和其他革新建议，但是许多经济工作人员身上所仍然保有的惰性、因循习惯和官僚主义却阻碍了它们。
    固然在推广和运用革新者的经验方面，经济工作者也是有自己困难的，但是在好的经济领导下，这些困难是完全可以克服的。
    应该把运用先进生产经验的事情放到国家轨道上来，应该使这件事成为法律，同伟大列宁下面的指示相符合：“使典型的力量首先成为精神上的典型，然后成为强制施行的典型……”（“列宁全集”第27卷第177页）
    国民经济的技术装备的大大增长、工人阶级的文化技术水平的提高和劳动生产率日益增长的水平，就决定了社会主义竞赛在现阶段发展的特点。
    在这些新的条件下，生产革新者本身成长了，已经今非昔比了。社会主义竞赛发展到新的、更高的阶段。这就要求另一种更高度的领导和组织水平。
    然而，我们在组织群众性社会主义竞赛方面，却存在着严重的缺点。其中最严重的缺点就是：
    破坏了保证公布和比较竞赛成就的列宁式的要求。推广竞赛成绩的工作做得不好。工人提出个人保证的情况减少了，这使得每个人对在集体面前担负的社会主义保证所负的道义责任感减低了。
    对竞赛中所获得的成就缺少精神上和物质上的奖励。很少利用精神鼓励的多种形式，必须说，还很少用勋章和奖章奖励工人——为争取生产中卓越成就而展开竞赛的先进工作者。各企业在全国社会主义竞赛中所得到的奖金，往往是分配得不正确的。
    远不是常常恰如其份地估计到那些为保证先进工人得到成就而花了很多劳动的工程师和技术人员的主动精神。这个缺点在竞赛的现阶段是特别不能容忍的，现在如果不紧密地和工程师技术人员合作、没有他们的领导，工人在改善技术和工艺方面，在改进劳动和生产组织方面要得到成就，是简直不能想像的。
    在劳动和生产组织方面阻碍着社会主义竞赛的严重缺点，首先是：每月甚至每一个工作日的工作不均匀，一个月的最后十天突击的现象以及工作日的严重损耗——在工业中平均每个工人在一天中损耗一个小时，有时一个半小时，甚至有两个小时的。
      这些缺点在目前特别不可容忍。我们的党通过了实行七小时工作制这一重要决议。我们相信，我们每一个苏联工人会用为祖国的福利和共产主义的胜利而进行英勇劳动的更大的热情来回答
  自己的党所作的这个历史性的决议。（掌声）
      不过，为了把这种热情变成行动，必须消灭目前严重的工时浪费现象。要消灭这些严重缺点，就要求坚决改进经济工作人员和工会组织、党组织方面的领导。
    经济工作人员首先要负责保证企业的工作正常、有节奏、不间断地进行。每一个经济工作人员不仅应该进行技术工作和组织生产；而且应该认真对待社会主义竞赛、对待人的工作，对他们的需要应该敏感。他应该去主动同群众、同党组织、工会组织和其他组织联系，而不要等着让这些组织来找他。
    每一个经济工作人员应该同党组织和工会组织一起进行工作来提高劳动纪律，同时通过为工人和职员创造正常的住宅生活条件、劳动保护等等方式来采取各种办法协助铲除经常破坏纪律的原因。
    特别应该强调经济工作人员在主持具有很大意义的生产会议这个工作中的作用。
    生产会议的性质是由我国的社会主义制度决定的。只是在我们的社会，广大工人群众直接参加生产管理工作的这种形式才可能存在。
    经济领导人员、工会工作者和党的工作者、革新工人和普通工人在组织得很好的、定期举行的生产会议上见面，而且应该在这里见面。生产会议应该成为制定保证提高劳动生产率、降低成本、挖掘节约潜力和扩大进一步改善工人的物质福利的源泉、扩大改善工人生活福利的企业基金的组织上技术上的措施的重要中心。
    生产会议是，而且应该是宣传、研究和采用先进经验的重要中心。
    每一个经济领导人、所有党的工作者，特别是工会工作者的直接职责就是，积极参加生产会议的工作，仔细研究工人、工程技术人员和职员的建议，并且使被采纳的建议付诸实行。
    六
    严重阻碍劳动生产率更迅速地提高和社会主义竞赛发展的，除上述各点外，还有规划工资和确定劳动定额中的现存的严重缺点。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志说得对，工资问题弄得很混乱。我们现在要尽力把它搞清楚。这是一项严重的任务。一个地区的工资跑到前面去了，另一地区的落在后面；一个部门的跑到前面去了，另一部门的落在后面；就是在同一个部中，也是一个工厂的车工按照一种标准取酬，而另一工厂又是按另一种标准取酬。需要花时间作一番深刻的分析，当然，除开其他的一切之外，还得有物质资料。但是，我们应该坚定处理这件事，首先是消除最明显的缺点。我们应该以个人物质利益的原则为出发点。
    还在苏维埃政权初期，列宁就指出了使人们从个人物质利益上关心劳动结果的原则及其对提高劳动生产率的意义，并且在他所签署的指令中从法律上加以肯定下来。
    但是，就是在现在从社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的时期，个人物质利益这一社会主义经济制度的极重要的原则，仍然是完全有效的，因为在这一时期按劳分配的法则是有效的。
    随着生产力的提高，劳动人民的物质生活水平也在提高，这是同资本主义完全相反的。在资本主义制度下，随着生产力的提高，资产阶级越来越富，而无产阶级越来越穷。这在多列士同志介绍关于法国劳动人民贫困的新材料的作品中说得很清楚、很鲜明。
    列宁所规定的社会主义社会中的工资规划的基本原则是完全正确的。这些原则在现在仍然有效，但是生活前进了，对它提出了修改，我们必须考虑到这些。
    实际上我们从1932年进行工资改革后，就再没有改变过工资制度，结果其中许多都已经过时了，在施行这一制度的具体形式上，也要求作一些重大的修改。
    工资制度的过时是工资规划的基本缺点。在大多数部门中作为工资基础的工资率尤其过时了。工业部门职工的平均工资从1940年到1955年增加了一倍多。而工资率几乎没有改变。
    结果，工人的实际上已经提高了的工资和工资率之间就有了很大距离。为了超过已经达到的工资水平，生产定额就得维持在低的水平上。
    因此，工资率和生产定额在提高劳动生产率和工资的问题上已经不是可以充分起组织作用的基础，因为差不多有一半工资得靠超额完成定额、靠奖金和其他额外收入取得。工资等级表，由于20年来的种种增添，包含有平均主义因素。
    我们的工业部门之所以把劳动定额定得不能令人满意、为采用新设备和技术革新以保证工人完成已有定额的重大工程措施之所以进行得不能令人满意，其中原因之一就是很低的工资率和实际工资之间存在着距离。
    由于现在整个工资规划中存在的阻碍着劳动生产率发展的重大缺点，迫切需要作详细的研究，并且进行整顿，也就是进行所谓工资改革和劳动定额改革。这不是一件轻而易举的事情，需要花时间，可能还得要资金，但是这件事必须做到。
    实现中央关于提高低薪人员的工资这一重要决议是一项重大的任务。这对提高这些人的生活水平有很大意义。
    正如中央的报告中所指出的，在制定劳动报酬制度的时候还必须注意如何使车间和企业领导人从物质利益上更加关心车间和企业的工作的结果。
    代表大会就中央委员会的报告所讨论的一切问题和即将就第六个五年计划的指示草案进行的讨论，涉及我国全体劳动人民的根本利益。必须着重指出，在这次代表大会上将提出并且解决对每一个劳动人民有直接的切身意义的若干问题。
    我所指的是根据中央委员会的决定在代表大会上提出的一些问题，诸如：过渡到7小时工作日，提高低薪工作人员的工资，大大改善劳动人民的养老金以及改善妇女的劳动和生活条件的问题。
    第六个五年计划的指示草案规定职工实际工资平均增长约30％；集体农民的收入平均至少增加40％；住宅建筑增加1倍，以及进一步扩大社会文化建设。
    这一切决定首先表现出社会主义在我国的胜利，表现出社会主义制度的不容争辩的优越性，表现出我们在卫国战争中的胜利以及在共产主义建设中的成就。这是我们党的最大限度地满足伟大苏联人民的日益增长的物质和文化需要的全部政策和实践的成果。
    我们毫不怀疑，我们英勇的工人阶级、集体农民和全体劳动人民——共产主义建设者——将以创造的积极性的新高涨来报答党和政府的这种关怀，来加强我们祖国的实力，使我们更加接近共产主义的胜利。（经久不息的掌声）
    七
    现在，在我们国家中已经具备了有利的客观可能性来加快从社会主义向共产主义过渡的速度。要使这些可能性变成现实，起决定性作用的是主观的因素，是提高经济生活和政治生活中各部门的领导的水平和修养。
    工会是最富群众性的工人阶级的组织，它使我们党和整个阶级联系在一起，它的作用特别大。现在工会团结着4，200万职工。
    毫无疑问，我们的工会在自己的工作上有很大的成就，对工人阶级、对党以及对国家有着不小的功绩。它在许多方面都可以作为人民民主国家兄弟工会的榜样，并且在国际工人运动中起着卓越的领导作用。
    但是，如果看不见工会工作中的许多严重缺点，那就错了，克服工会工作中的严重缺点，就会大大提高工会在共产主义建设中的作用。
    党中央委员会7月全会指出，必须改进工会在下列方面的工作：领导社会主义竞赛，消灭这一方面的形式主义，更广泛地推广生产中的先进工人和革新者的经验，加强劳动纪律，以争取提高劳动生产率和职工的物质福利。
    无论是企业中的或者是中央的工会都应该表现出比现在更大的主动性、坚持性和战斗性，来揭露和克服在劳动定额和工资标准方面，在反对对职工的劳动和生活的官僚主义态度方面以及在劳动保护方面所存在的重大缺点。
    工会必须更加注意劳动问题和与它有直接联系的生产问题。在这一点上，工会应该在生产会议上起很大的作用，必须使生产会议的工作活跃起来并且大大改进这一工作。
    在整个工会工作中，从上到下都应该贯穿着布尔什维克式的与下列现象不调和的精神，这些现象就是官僚主义的不良作风以及对工人生产革新者、对满足工人和全体劳动者的日益增长的需求采取的漠不关心的态度。
    现在工会比以往任何时候都更加需要以积极参加共产主义建设的行动来不辜负伟大的列宁所给予它的作为共产主义的学校的定义，列宁说，它并不是一个普通类型的学校，它是一个学习管理的学校、一个学习经济工作的学校，是一个共产主义的学校。
  （掌声）
    我们国家在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会之前所取得的辉煌胜利，再一次有力地表明作为正在建设共产主义的苏维埃社会的主要的鼓舞力量和组织力量的我们党的伟大的和决定性的作用。
    党组织应当改进自己对工会组织和其他群众团体工作的领导，不应代替它们，也不应降低它们的责任。
    党组织应当教育所有的经济、工会和共青团的领导人和一切职工，培养他们对完成自己任务的高度责任感，应当把党的全部组织工作和党的群众工作做到这种地步，使它的工作能具体影响每一个共产党员，并且通过共产党员来影响所有的非党群众。
    在深入掌握生产技术和生产管理的基础上，党组织应当领导和指导工人、集体农民、人民的知识分子的日益增长的创造性积极性和主动性，领导他们开展社会主义竞赛，采用和更好地利用新的技术和革新者的方法，提高生产率，减轻苏联人民的劳动和提高他们的物质和文化福利。
    同群众紧密的不可分割的联系，善于听取群众的呼声和辨明他们的迫切需要，不仅教育群众而且还要向群众学习，这一切过去是、现在仍然是我们党的力量和无往而不胜的最重要的泉源之一。一个好的布尔什维克首先应当是一个好的群众工作者。
    中央委员会在总结所谈到的时期中的工作是同生活和群众进行联系、善于反映和实现他们的创造性主动性和愿望的一个鲜明的例子。
    虽然党和政府在改善和精简国家机关的方面取得了一定的成就，但是在国家机关中仍然存在着严重的缺点。其中主要的缺点是：一部分国家机关的领导干部同群众、同生活的联系不够，有官僚主义作风。
    应当争取作到这一步：使各部一直到各企业、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场为止的领导人员更加经常地到生产场地上去，见见工人和集体农民的面，解答他们所感兴趣的、所关心的尖锐问题。这样，领导者自己才会更尖锐地提出自己工作中的问题。
    我还想指出一个我认为重要的问题。在审理劳动者的来信和申诉方面存在着很大的缺点。必须要做到由领导者接待劳动者，看他们的来信、申诉书和申请书，敏锐地、有效地加以处理。
    苏维埃人、劳动人民过去是、现在仍然是我们党注意的中心。除开人民的利益，除开为全体劳动人民的幸福而进行斗争之外，党没有而且也不可能有其他的利益。正因为这样，人民才爱戴、拥护并且将一直拥护自己亲爱的共产党。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们国家和经济建设各部门有很多的优秀干部，他们无限忠实于党和人民，这是我们的巨大成果，同时也是胜利地完成我们在第六个五年计划中所面临的任务的最重要的保证之一。现在必须作更大的努力来从质量上提高这些干部，提高他们的技术、政治和经济知识水平。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的总结报告中尖锐地提出了关于加强党的思想工作、消除理论和实践互相脱节的现象的问题，在这方面有着巨大的意义。根据中央委员会的要求的精神纠正这方面现有的缺点，无疑地会取得成果。干部将提高自己的理论水平，将更成功地解决共产主义建设的任务。理论从这当中将有所收益，它将被用新的经验、共产主义建设的实践丰富起来，而实践也将有所收益，它将更好地得到理论的阐述。
    中央委员会的总结报告是在高度思想理论水平上作出的，这一点充分反映了中央在总结报告所谈到的时期内的工作和党的全部生活。
    大家知道，中央在这段时期中研究和提出了一系列有原则性和有理论意义的重大问题，这就是关于我国重工业进一步发展的道路、关于对共产主义建设现阶段的估价、关于国际政策问题和其他问题。
    在第十九次党代表大会以后，中央委员会大胆地（我指的是思想上、原则上、理论上的大胆）提出了同个人崇拜作斗争的问题。这不是个简单的问题。但是中央对这一问题作了正确的、马克思列宁主义的、有党性的回答。个人崇拜是一种有害的崇拜，它降低群众、党及其领导干部的作用。
    揭露个人崇拜，正确地、马克思列宁主义地认识人民群众的作用、党及其领导干部的作用、领袖的作用，对加强党的团结有非常大的意义。对个人崇拜所作的斗争，是形成我们党的集体领导的极其重要的因素。
    党的集体领导保证领导正确，保证对党和国家生活的各项重大问题作出全面的深刻分析和列宁主义的解决。
    最重要的是在于：党的集体领导是在党性的、原则性的、马克思列宁主义基础上的统一和团结一致。
    恢复党内生活的列宁主义准则促进了并且将会更大地促进党的团结的加强，这个准则是依照党的几十年的斗争所制定的，它是党——正在胜利地建设着共产主义的苏维埃社会的主要鼓舞和组织力量——的全部活动的基础。　（掌声）
    同志们！第二十次党代表大会的特点在于：它在已经达到的水平的基础上有可能规划在历史上最短的时期内创造丰富的工业品和食品的行动纲领，规划加速从社会主义向共产主义过渡的纲领。
    因此，苏共第二十次代表大会标志着党为实现天才的列宁的建设共产主义社会的总计划而斗争的一个新的、更高的阶段。第二十次代表大会将作为共产主义的胜利建设者的代表大会而列入党史。　（暴风雨般的掌声）
    中央委员会的总结报告和第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案，开辟了加速我国在技术、经济、社会、文化、科学生活各方面的进步、增进苏联人民的福利、加强社会主义国家的国力的宏伟前景。这个前景将会更加提高我们党和我们祖国在世界各国人民心目中的声誉，它将在每个共产党员、每个苏联人的心灵中引起合理的爱国主义自豪和欢欣的感情。　（掌声）
    这种苏维埃的爱国主义是同我们的无产阶级国际主义密不可分的，因为我们是在同伟大的中国人民、同各人民民主国家的劳动人民的兄弟般的紧密合作中、是在世界各国劳动人民的同情和支持下建设共产主义。（掌声）
    在总结报告所谈到的时期内，我们党的力量，党的领导的力量一次又一次地经过了考验。这种考验表明，人民有一个忠实于他们的、团结一致的、列宁主义的党。党有坚强的、团结的、经过战斗考验的、列宁式的中央委员会，它无愧于伟大的苏联共产党。（经久不息的掌声）
    在列宁式的中央委员会的领导下的我们的伟大的坚强团结的党，在党的领导下的英雄的苏联人民，将取得共产主义的完全胜利。（暴风雨般的掌声）　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科24日电）
