Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th. The second agreement between Japan and the United States regarding the purchase of surplus American agricultural products was formally signed on the afternoon of February 10th in Tokyo by Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu and U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Allison. The content of this agreement was determined with the United States last September when Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Ichiro Kono visited the United States.

The agreement stipulates that Japan will purchase $65.8 million worth of surplus U.S. agricultural products. According to Kyodo News, Japan did not obtain the 200,000 tons of soybeans it had hoped to purchase, but must spend nearly $3 million to buy 1,500 tons of tobacco, while Japan's domestic inventory of this type of tobacco is almost enough for 3 years. In addition, the amount of U.S. cotton that Japan purchases under this agreement is more than double the amount it originally hoped to purchase.

Of the funds Japan spends to purchase these surplus agricultural products, 25% will be directly used by the United States to construct military facilities and procure military supplies in Japan; the remaining 75% will be treated as loans to Japan, with annual interest rates of 3% or 4%. Some of these loans will be used for projects related to the development of military industries. Japanese economic commentator Takuichi Ikumi once pointed out that the U.S. dumping of surplus agricultural products on Japan is "to promote the rearmament that the United States demands Japan to implement."

    美国向日本倾销农产品
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日美两国关于购买美国剩余农产品的第二次协定已经在2月10日下午由日本外务相重光葵和美国驻日大使艾利逊在东京正式签字。这项协定的内容在去年9月日本农林相河野一郎访问美国时就同美国确定了。
    协定规定日本将购买6，580万美元的美国剩余农产品。据共同社说，日本没有得到自己希望购买的20万吨大豆，却要耗费近300万美元去买1，500吨烟叶，而在日本国内这种烟叶的存货差不多可以用3年。另外，日本根据这项协定购买的美国棉花也超过了它原来希望购买的数量一倍。
    日本购买这些剩余农产品的价款中，25％由美国直接用于在日本建设军用设施和采购军火；其余75％作为日本的借款，每年要付出3％或者4％的利息。这些借款中有一部分要用于同发展军事工业有关的事业方面。日本经济评论家井汲卓一曾经指出：美国向日本倾销剩余农产品是“为了促进美国要求日本实行的重整军备”。
