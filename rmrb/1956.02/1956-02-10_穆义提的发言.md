Mu Yiti's Speech

    Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:
    I wholeheartedly endorse the reports of Chairman Zhou Enlai and other leaders, and I am willing to strive for their complete realization.
    Currently, we are in the midst of the great socialist revolution. The high tide of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the high tide of the cooperative transformation of handicrafts, and the high tide of the overall public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce are advancing victoriously, one after another. It is truly gratifying and inspiring that our great motherland with its 600 million people is so prosperous and that socialist construction is advancing so rapidly. I am proud to have been born in this great country and great era, and I feel even more honored to be able to contribute all my strength to socialist construction.
    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was established in 1955. The people of all ethnic groups there also welcomed the great socialist revolution with a hundredfold confidence and courage. They all know clearly from their own experience that it is never wrong to listen to Chairman Mao and follow the Communist Party. All ethnic groups are more closely united, and a vigorous high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has been launched. In addition to the enthusiastic participation of farmers in cooperatives, religious figures have also actively participated in cooperatives. For example, in the third district and third township of Atushi County, 11 out of 15 religious figures above the rank of Imam have joined cooperatives. In addition, they have organized propaganda groups to promote the superiority of cooperatives among the masses, especially among religious figures, which has also played a certain role.
    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has vast land that can be cultivated in large quantities, and many places rarely visited by people contain endless treasures. The people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region are looking forward to the rapid completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and are carrying out various preparations to adapt to the new situation of vigorously developing industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry after the railway is completed. We will expand the original 24,650,000 mu of cultivated land to 100 million mu within 12 years, and increase the original 18,980,000 heads of livestock in the autonomous region to 57,300,000 heads of livestock. Within 12 years, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region will be transformed into an unimaginable state of development and prosperity. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, as members of the great family of the People's Republic of China, are also glorious and worthy of pride. However, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is vast and sparsely populated, and the work we should do is great and arduous. Therefore, without relying on the labor force of our Han compatriots from the interior, we cannot complete the arduous and glorious task of building socialism in a timely manner. The people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region are warmly welcoming more compatriots from the interior to Xinjiang to help us.
    In Chairman Zhou Enlai's report, he pointed out the important role played by workers, peasants, and intellectuals in socialist construction. Before and during the large-scale economic construction in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, a large number of specialized technical personnel in various departments are needed. However, there are only 1,054 senior intellectuals in Xinjiang, of which only 196 are senior intellectuals from 11 ethnic minorities, averaging one senior intellectual for every 25,000 people. In terms of quantity and quality, it is truly pitifully scarce. Therefore, we warmly welcome Han senior intellectuals and various specialized talents to our autonomous region to help us carry out construction work and contribute their efforts to cultivating local ethnic intellectuals and technical cadres. In addition, in our group's discussions, comrades from the northwestern provinces have the same desire. Therefore, I would also like to represent them here in requesting the Central Government to send more experts, engineers, and technical personnel to work in the northwestern provinces.
    The work of eliminating all counter-revolutionary elements is also urgently needed in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In our autonomous region, counter-revolutionary elements are constantly carrying out various sabotage activities. For example, a farmer in Heshure County sent his child to guard the field after the autumn harvest. At night, counter-revolutionary elements set fire to it, not only burning the farmer's year's labor but also burning an eleven or twelve-year-old child alive. In addition, counter-revolutionary elements who carry out counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of religion are also spreading rumors everywhere, hindering production, and undermining socialist construction. Therefore, we must be more vigilant, keep our eyes open, and rely on the strength of the masses to continue to resolutely and deeply carry out the struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Only by thoroughly eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionary elements can we ensure the smooth progress of our socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    Taiwan is China's sacred territory, and the Taiwan compatriots are an inseparable part of the Chinese people. Liberating Taiwan by any means is an internal affair of China, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and Taiwan will inevitably return to the motherland. No third party has any right to interfere in this. The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, like the people of the whole country, have always paid attention to and cared about the liberation of Taiwan. No matter what means are used to liberate Taiwan, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, are willing to contribute all their strength to strive for the complete unification of the motherland.
    Finally, I would like to make the following suggestions:
    1. In recent years, ethnic minorities in border areas have continuously organized visiting groups to visit the interior, which has made the people of all ethnic minorities realize the greatness and loveliness of the motherland. It has played a great role in enhancing their patriotic ideology. At the same time, we also ask compatriots in the interior to visit the border areas. In the past, reactionary rulers described the border areas as either "icy and snowy" or "barren areas," simply an uninhabitable place. This left a very bad impression in the minds of many people. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, this view has basically been changed, but I think it is beneficial to organize compatriots in the interior to visit. I invite compatriots in the interior to also come and see the various constructions in the border areas after liberation, see the vast land, rich resources, and the vigorous spirit of all ethnic groups struggling hard to improve their lives and build the motherland. This can also promote the enthusiasm of compatriots in the interior to help build the motherland's border areas and help ethnic minorities carry out economic and cultural construction. This is also beneficial to our ethnic minorities.
    2. The number of high and middle-level intellectuals in ethnic minority areas is pitifully small. In order to cultivate more senior intellectuals, it is necessary to cultivate middle-level intellectuals in advance. After liberation, the Central Government paid special attention to this issue and cultivated a large number of middle-level technical cadres of various ethnic groups, but this still cannot meet the current needs. In order to cultivate more high and middle-level intellectuals, we ask the Central Government to take various measures and pay more attention to this issue.
    3. In order to cultivate senior intellectuals of ethnic minorities, we should first cultivate translation talents with higher skills, and translate relevant policies, laws, theoretical learning books and reference materials in a timely and large-scale manner, so that ethnic minorities can have rich cultural food, and on the basis of gradually improving the cultural level of the people of all ethnic minorities, it will be easier to cultivate senior intellectuals. In addition, in order for all ethnic minorities to learn better or more easily from the Han elder brothers, they should understand the Han language. Therefore, I suggest that all ethnic minorities send a large number of young people to the interior to specialize in learning Chinese. Only in this way can we lay the foundation for learning from the Han elder brothers and cultivating senior intellectuals. This is my personal opinion, and I hope that the committee members and participants of all ethnic minorities will consider it.
    If there are any inappropriate points in my speech, please give me more instructions from the leaders, committee members, and comrades.

    穆义提的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心拥护周恩来主席及其他各位首长的报告，并愿为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    目前，我们正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中。如农业的社会主义改造的高潮，手工业合作化和资本主义工商业全行业公私合营的高潮，正胜利接着胜利地向前迈进。拥有6亿人口的伟大祖国如此兴盛，社会主义建设事业如此前进，这是值得我们欢欣鼓舞的。我因生长在这个伟大国度和伟大时代里而感到骄傲，并能为社会主义建设贡献出我全部力量更感到光荣。
    新疆维吾尔自治区是在1955年成立的。那里的各族人民也以百倍的信心与勇气迎接了伟大的社会主义革命高潮的来临。他们都从自己的经验明确的知道：听毛主席的话，跟着共产党走，是没有错的。各民族更加亲密团结，轰轰烈烈地展开了农业、手工业、资本主义工商业社会主义改造的高潮。除农民们踊跃参加了合作社外，宗教界人士也热烈地参加了合作社，如阿图什县三区三乡的15户依麻目以上的宗教界人士中，就有11户参加了合作社，此外他们还组织了宣传小组，到群众中，特别是到宗教界人士中，宣传合作社的优越性，也起了一定的作用。
    新疆维吾尔自治区土地辽阔，可以大量开垦，许多人迹罕到的地方，蕴藏着无限的宝藏。自治区的各族人民正企望着兰新铁路的迅速修通，并为适应铁路修通后大力发展工业、农业和牧业的新形势的发展而进行各项准备工作。我们要在12年内将原有的24，650，000亩耕地面积扩大到一亿亩，将自治区原有18，980，000头牲畜发展到57，300，000头牲畜。12年内将使新疆维吾尔自治区改变为想像不到的发展与繁荣。所以新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民在作为中华人民共和国大家庭的一个成员来说，也是光荣与值得骄傲的。但新疆维吾尔自治区地域辽阔，人口很少，而我们所应作的工作是伟大的又是繁重的，所以我们不依靠关内汉族同胞的劳动力，是不能及时地完成建设社会主义的艰巨而又光荣的任务的。自治区的各族人民正以热烈的心情欢迎内地同胞多多地到新疆去帮助我们。
    在周恩来主席的报告中指出了在社会主义建设中，工人、农民以及知识分子所起的重大作用。新疆维吾尔自治区在大规模经济建设开始以前和大规模建设中，都需要有大量的各部门专门的技术人员。而我们新疆现有高级知识分子只有1，054人，其中11个少数民族的高级知识分子则仅有196人，平均25，000人中才有一个高级知识分子。拿数量与质量来说，真是贫乏得可怜。因而，我们热烈欢迎汉族的高级知识分子和各项专门人材到我们自治区去帮助我们进行建设工作，为培养本地民族的知识分子和技术干部贡献出他们的力量。此外，在我们小组的讨论中，西北各省的同志们都有同一的愿望，因而我在这里也代表着他们提出请中央多派专家、工程师、技术人员到西北各省工作的要求。
    关于肃清一切反革命分子的工作，在新疆维吾尔自治区也有同样迫切的需要。在我们自治区里，反革命分子进行各种破坏活动也是层出不穷的。如和硕县一家农民在秋收后派他的孩子看守场园，夜间反革命分子去放火，不但把农民一年的劳动果实烧掉，而且将一个十一二岁的孩子活活烧死。此外，披着宗教外衣进行反革命活动的反革命分子，也在各处造谣，阻挠生产，破坏社会主义建设。因而我们必须更加提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，依靠群众的力量继续坚决地、深入地进行肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争。唯有彻底肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，才能保障我们社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。
    台湾是中国的神圣领土，台湾同胞是中国人民不可分离的一部分，用任何方式解放台湾是中国内部的事务，中国人民一定要解放台湾，台湾亦必然归还祖国。这是任何第三者没有任何权力加以干涉的。新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民与全国人民一样，对于解放台湾一向是注意的，关怀的。不管用任何方式解放台湾，新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民，在中国共产党领导之下，与全国各族人民一道，愿拿出他们所有的力量为争取祖国的完全统一而奋斗。
    最后，我提出如下几点建议：
    一、几年来边疆地区各少数民族不断组织参观团到内地来参观，使各少数民族人民认识到祖国的伟大可爱。在提高他们爱国主义思想方面起了很大的作用。同时我们要求内地同胞也能到边疆去参观。因为过去反动统治者把边疆地区形容得不是“冰天雪地”，就是“不毛之区”，简直是人烟不到的绝境了。在许多人们的思想认识当中留下了很不好的印象。解放之后，在党的领导下，这种看法基本上是改变了，但我认为组织内地同胞去参观，是有好处的。我邀请内地同胞也到那里看看解放后边疆地区的各项建设，看看广阔的土地、丰富的资源以及欣欣向荣为提高生活、为祖国建设的各族人民顽强奋斗的精神。这也能促进内地同胞对建设祖国边疆帮助各少数民族进行经济、文化建设的热情。这对于我们少数民族来说也是有好处的。
    二、少数民族地区的高、中级知识分子是少得可怜。为了培养更多的高级知识分子，必须事先多多地培养中级知识分子。解放后中央特别注意了这个问题，大量培养了各民族的中级技术干部，但还不能满足当前的需要。为了更多的培养高、中级知识分子，所以我们要求中央采取各项措施，对此问题多予重视。
    三、为了培养少数民族的高级知识分子，事先应培养具有较高技术的翻译人才，及时地大量地翻译有关政策、法令、理论学习的书籍和参考资料，这样才能使少数民族有丰富的文化食粮，并在逐步提高各少数民族人民的文化水平的基础上，也就易于培养出高级知识分子。此外，为了各少数民族更好地或更便于向汉族老大哥学习起见，就应当懂得汉族语文。故我建议各少数民族应大量地派送青年们到内地来专门学习汉文汉语。只有这样，才能为向汉族老大哥学习和培养高级知识分子打下基础。这是我个人的意见，希望各少数民族的委员们和列席同志们加以考虑。
    我的发言有不妥当的地方，还请各位首长、各位委员、各位同志多予指示。
