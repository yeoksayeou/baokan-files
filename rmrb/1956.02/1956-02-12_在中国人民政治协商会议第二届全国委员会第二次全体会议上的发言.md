Speech at the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

Zhao Jingnong's speech

Chairman, fellow members:

I have listened to the reports of Premier Zhou and other leaders these past few days, and I completely agree with them and wholeheartedly support them.

I am the acting bishop of the Tianshui Diocese of the Catholic Church in Gansu (including the Wudu Special District). In our diocese, since liberation six years ago, all religious rituals and activities have continued uninterrupted and have never been interfered with. The patriotic religious movement in our diocese and all the policies and decrees of the People's Government have also been implemented smoothly, without any disagreements. The reason for this is, of course, the wise and correct concern and unity shown by the Party and religious leadership organizations, which has dispelled all our worries and allowed us to discuss and resolve all issues without any distance from the Party and leadership organizations. Another reason is that we first worked to unify the thinking of the clergy in our Tianshui Diocese, eliminating unnecessary concerns among the clergy leadership. Every member of the clergy in our diocese dares to approach the Party without fear and to engage in close consultation with the Party and leadership organizations to resolve all issues related to patriotism and love for the religion. Of course, things are not always perfect, and not everything meets our ideals, but we have always adhered to the principle of mutual understanding and consultation. Therefore, the higher levels set an example for the lower levels, laying a preliminary foundation for uniting the believers and promoting patriotism and love for the religion. However, it cannot be denied that although unity within the diocese has been achieved, we have not been able to avoid external attacks. We have suffered great spiritual blows: our priests and believers have not been able to enjoy the right to religious ceremonies in some areas, and some believers from other areas do not participate in our religious services when they come to our diocese. They slander and defame us as schismatics, apostates, deviating from dogma, and breaking away from the Pope. Therefore, we have suffered great internal blows and pain. However, for the past few years, we have steadfastly and unswervingly maintained our attitude, and we have finally received the support of the Party and the broad masses of patriotic people, and we have not been defeated. Today, our diocese is also very honored not to have discovered any hidden, serious, active counter-revolutionaries, which is also one of the glorious achievements of the Party and religious leadership organizations.

Imperialists and enemies at home and abroad are not reconciled to their defeat. Seeing that everything in New China is developing rapidly, with brilliant achievements in politics, military affairs, culture, diplomacy, etc., they cannot deny or slander these facts, but they use the excuse that the Communist Party does not believe in God, has no religious beliefs, cannot cooperate with the Communist Party, and cannot love the country led by the Communist Party, etc., to spread slander. But these are all errors contrary to the facts. Chairman Liu Shaoqi, in explaining the Constitution, and Premier Zhou Enlai, at the Asian-African Conference, both gave detailed and sincere answers. In fact, delegations from various countries, including religious groups, have also seen and heard with their own eyes that there is religious belief in the New China led by the Communist Party. Since liberation six years ago, not a single religion has been prevented or eliminated. Chairman Mao said: "Those who believe in religion and those who do not have their own freedom, and no one should be forced or discriminated against." Chairman Mao also said to the Tibetan tribute delegation: "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, and believers and non-believers, those who believe in this religion or those who believe in other religions, are all protected, and their beliefs are respected. Today we adopt a policy of protecting religion, and we will continue to adopt a policy of protecting religion in the future." Today, I, a leader of a purely religious profession who has been detached from production and has made no contribution to the motherland and the people for many years, can come from the remote northwest to the capital to participate in this important and great event, which is a concrete realization of Chairman Mao's words and the Communist Party's religious policy. Therefore, I hope that all Catholics in the country, especially the clergy, will strengthen their studies, raise their awareness, be bold and fearless, dispel all concerns, and sincerely and honestly unite with the patriotic people of the country, rally around the Party and the People's Government, speak their minds, discuss things, and happily and joyfully carry out their dual major tasks of patriotism and love for the religion in New China, and no longer have any wavering hesitation or hesitation. According to my personal experience, the Party wants to unite all possible forces to build the motherland, and it also frankly wants to unite our 4 million Catholics in China. Fellow believers, please try it!

Secondly, Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. Premier Zhou Enlai, at this conference, on behalf of the people and the Chinese government, announced that everyone can return to the mainland of the motherland, and all past actions will be forgiven. Therefore, I also hope that the Catholics in Taiwan, after hearing or seeing Premier Zhou Enlai's announcement, will quickly and boldly return to the embrace of the motherland! The New China on the mainland will never interfere with religious belief, but on the contrary, will protect and respect it without discrimination. Please come and see, compatriots in Taiwan!

When I was leaving Gansu, the priests and believers in our Tianshui Diocese repeatedly told me: when you arrive in the capital, don't forget to convey everyone's respect and greetings to Chairman Mao and the leaders, so here I also, with extreme sincerity and respect, represent the entire Tianshui Diocese in wishing Chairman Mao, the leaders, and all the members good health! Finally, I wish the conference a victorious success!

Zhang Zhen's speech

Chairman, fellow members, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's political report and agree with the reports of Vice-Chairmen Li, Guo, Chen, and Dong and Member Chen Boda. This time, I inspected the fisheries production cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives in the Qingdao and Yantai areas, and the most outstanding was the Xingfu Apple Production Cooperative in Yantai. Now, I will briefly introduce this cooperative to you:

There is a place called Xishawang in the suburbs of Yantai, which used to be a barren desert with no inhabitants. It is said that in the twenty or thirty years before liberation, famine refugees from other villages gradually built thatched huts and lived side by side, filling the land with soil and planting trees and fruits. Although the general residents depended on apple orchards for their livelihood, the production per mu was only one or two hundred catties, and they still suffered from cold and hunger after years of hard work. They were also successively plundered and destroyed by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the people were particularly poor, even displaced and homeless.

After liberation, thanks to the correct leadership and active support of the Party and the People's Government, the transition from mutual aid to cooperation greatly increased the enthusiasm for production, and at the same time greatly improved productivity. In 1953, the cooperative was established by three mutual aid groups, and the average labor remuneration for each member was around 600 yuan. By 1955, the output increased significantly, with an average of 3,900 catties per mu, and the highest output was more than 9,000 catties per mu, which was unprecedented.

The main reasons for the increased production are: Comrade Zhang Zongjiang, a technical instructor, painstakingly researched and basically eliminated various diseases and insect pests. He also has sufficient experience in pruning, grafting, drainage, drought prevention, and fertilization. In particular, the enthusiastic support of the leadership also played a powerful role. The Yantai Qingxiangjiao apple variety is fragrant, sweet, and crisp, not only the best in the country, but also sold to Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places, completely overwhelming the apple market in the United States and Japan. It is a pity that the quantity is not enough for promotion.

According to Comrade Zhang Zongjiang, with the gradual improvement of science and technology, it can be guaranteed to reach 10,000 catties per mu in a few years. The suburbs of Yantai can plant 20,000 mu of apples (currently 10,000 mu), and the future prospects are even brighter.

In 1955, the Xingfu Apple Production Cooperative, in addition to all expenses, each laborer could get a maximum of 1,100 yuan, and the ordinary laborer from 600 yuan to more than 700 yuan, an average of more than 700 yuan per person, and women an average of 360 yuan. By 1956, male laborers could get an average of 950 yuan, and female laborers could get an average of 750 yuan (because a nursery was established). Every year, 20% of the public accumulation fund is used to expand reproduction, and a welfare fund is set aside for relief and cultural activities. The entire material and cultural life is improving day by day. Comparing the past and the present, it is really heaven and hell. All the people in the village are grateful to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and they are overjoyed beyond words. At the same time, everyone sincerely came up with two proverbs: "Xishawang has become Xingfu Village, and the poor beach has become a golden beach."

I am now using a tune that is neither a song nor a poem, to compile a ditty based on this fact, and I hope you will give me your advice.

Titled "Xishawang has become Xingfu Village, and the poor beach has become a golden beach."

In the past, Xishawang was all poor beach,
How many famine victims cut through thorns and brambles,
Facing hardship and danger, filling the land with soil and planting trees,
Planting fruit trees all over, but they were destroyed by the ferocious Japanese invaders and the vicious Chiang Kai-shek bandits, causing disaster to countless old and young.

Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army came and immediately drove away the demons, abolishing feudalism, carrying out land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and then suppressing counter-revolutionaries, which taught the broad masses of poor people to turn themselves over.

In the past few years, the situation here has gradually improved. Let's look at this year's highest yield, more than 9,000 catties per mu has been finalized. Such a bumper harvest has rarely been seen before. It is reflected in pruning, grafting, treating diseases and killing insects, weeding and fertilizing, preventing waterlogging and drought, accumulating many valuable experiences, and the leadership has played a more important role. The ideological breakthrough broadens the vision, and the old small-scale peasant economy has nothing to do with us. Sharp struggle, striving to catch up with socialism.

No matter the cold wind or the scorching sun, always sweating all year round, for the sake of adapting to the requirements of industrialization, not willing to let the horticultural style fall behind others, but also responding to Chairman Mao's call, following the cooperative upsurge, completing the task ahead of schedule, and striving for further development.

Further improve technology, sell well at home and abroad to earn foreign exchange, and support the construction.

The surplus profit is distributed according to labor, and each person has more than 700 yuan, 20 percent of the public accumulation fund expands reproduction, welfare fund, established a nursery, and equal pay for equal work for men and women is truly realized, improving the material life, and the cultural life has also been changed.

The masses are encouraged, old and young are rejoicing, the vast future is even more unlimited, comparing the past and the present, it is heaven and earth.

Grateful to Chairman Mao, grateful to the Communist Party, songs are everywhere.

This is "Xishawang has become Xingfu Village, and the poor beach has become a golden beach."

Deng Wenhui's speech

Chairman, fellow members, fellow comrades:

I am attending this meeting with unparalleled joy as our motherland enters a great period of socialist revolution and construction. I fully endorse Premier Zhou's political report and the various reports of other leading comrades.

I am a 77-year-old man, and I have participated in many revolutions in my life, but they have all failed and have not benefited the people. But today, just over six years after the liberation of the motherland, it has achieved such great accomplishments in all aspects, and has also meticulously planned a beautiful future development prospect. This is thanks to the good leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the brilliant and wise Chairman Mao. I feel that being in today is the supreme glory and happiness.

A month before coming to this meeting, I went to inspect Yong'an and Gangkou districts in Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province, and saw with my own eyes that the agricultural cooperativization movement had achieved a great victory in the countryside. The peasants have launched a high tide of taking the socialist road. I saw that the poor peasant leading cadres grasped the line and policies of running the society very well, and were supported by the masses. The members of each society have a high enthusiasm for production, are energetic and lovely, and have emerged a lot of capable and active production people. I believe that within this year, semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization can be fully realized throughout the country, and socialist agricultural cooperativization can be realized in two years. And recently, the Party Central Committee has proposed a draft of the "National Agricultural Development Outline from 1956 to 1967", which further depicts the beautiful and glorious prospects of agricultural production and rural work in our country, and points out the goals of struggle for the 500 million farmers across the country. I think this goal can be achieved and can be realized.

Speaking of the international situation, it is also very favorable to us. We can vigorously engage in our socialist revolution and construction, because our cause is a just cause, which is deeply popular in the world, so-called those who gain the way will get more help. The aggression group headed by U.S. imperialism is doing injustice, it will be self-destructing, it is losing the way and getting little help. What's more, we have the increasingly powerful socialist peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, which has enough power to stop the aggression group's war adventure. As Premier Zhou revealed, if the aggression group dares to launch the Third World War, the loser will not only be this or that imperialist country, but the entire imperialist system. Living in such an international environment that is conducive to our country, we should all do our best to transform ourselves well and work well to serve the people.

After liberation, the People's Government took good care of us, especially for those of us who are older. Taking my own personal experience as an example, I feel that it is very good. For example, this time I came to the meeting, because I was sick, and the person in charge of the meeting took care of me and the medical staff treated me with care, which was better than my relatives. The Party and the people are so warm and caring for me, I can only be deeply grateful!

Although I am relatively old, I firmly believe that under the Party's care and encouragement, I can live to be 90 to 100 years old. In the future, I will devote my energy to doing more work for the people, so as not to live up to the glory given to me by the Party and the people.

I wish the conference a successful success and everyone good health.

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

Dong Weichuan's speech

Chairman, fellow members, fellow comrades:

In this meeting, I have listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's political report, President Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of socialist revolution, and the four important reports of other responsible comrades, which all make me feel extremely excited! These reports reflect the great victories of our New China's socialist construction and socialist transformation in all aspects. These victories are interconnected and are the overall victory of class struggle under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and it is precisely the victory of Marxism-Leninism in China. In the various reports, not only summarized the fundamental changes that have taken place in our country in politics, economy, culture, education... but also pointed out the direction of future efforts, especially on how to fully mobilize and give full play to the strength of Chinese intellectuals, which is put forward as a key point. This makes me, as an intellectual and educator, not only wholeheartedly support, but also have to consider some problems of the past, present and future in combination with my own business. What I want to say at this moment is about this aspect.

Premier Zhou told us: "In the socialist era, it is even more necessary than in any previous era to fully improve production technology, and it is even more necessary to fully develop science and utilize scientific knowledge. Therefore, if we want to develop socialist construction more, faster, better and more economically, in order to develop socialist construction, we must rely not only on the active labor of the working class and the broad masses of peasants, but also on the active labor of intellectuals, that is to say, we must rely on the close cooperation between manual labor and mental labor, and rely on the fraternal alliance of workers, peasants and intellectuals. The various constructions we are now carrying out are increasingly in need of the participation of intellectuals." This passage shows the important tasks entrusted to intellectuals by New China as it entered the socialist era. This is something that has never happened in Chinese history. "Relying on the fraternal alliance of workers, peasants and intellectuals" is such an honor for intellectuals!

In the past few years, under the unity, education, and transformation of the Party, Chinese intellectuals have undergone fundamental changes. But whether in terms of quantity, business level, or political consciousness, they are still unable to meet the needs of the rapid development of socialist cause. This has become a prominent problem at present. Taking the higher normal education I am engaged in as an example, it undertakes the task of cultivating teachers for New China, not only cultivating teachers for secondary schools, but also cultivating teachers for higher normal schools, therefore, its task is to directly and indirectly cultivate socialist new people; it is a "working machine." But under the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the problem of eliminating illiteracy has come, the problem of popularizing compulsory education for children has come, the problem of transporting a large number of new students to universities has come, the problem of transporting cadres at all levels to various jobs that are becoming more and more detailed has come, the problem of supplying a large number of textbooks and reading materials has come, ... These urgent problems all need manpower, that is, all need teachers. Where do these teachers come from? Undoubtedly, it depends on the working machine in education. This problem, from the point of view of quantity, requires higher normal schools to enroll a large number of students, to use large classes, to use the two-part system, to use correspondence courses and all possible methods to solve. The faculty of senior normal schools themselves are not enough, so it is necessary to cultivate a large number of new forces, such as retaining more teaching assistants, recruiting more graduate students, and so on. Only by doing this can the ranks of senior and middle-level teachers be expanded. In this case, it is bound to require full play to the enthusiasm of existing teachers. Are there not some teachers whose workload is not enough? Are there not some teachers who can overfulfill their tasks? Is there not some time that is not allocated reasonably? Are there not some meetings that are too many, too long or unnecessary? Are there not some old teachers who only bring one or two apprentices or even none? If we make practical plans and mobilize seriously, it should be said that there is potential to be tapped. When it comes to potential, it is not only a matter of quantity, but also a requirement for quality.

The issue of quality includes both business level and political consciousness. Today, six years after liberation, although only 40% of teachers have made progress in politics, whether they are middle or backward, they are continuing to make progress and change to varying degrees. In terms of business, in the past few years, through the criticism of bourgeois idealism, the study of advanced Soviet experience, the collective research of various subject teaching and research offices, and the efforts of each individual, they have also reached a certain level. The old knowledge and methods of general old teachers, after criticism, are not without useful parts. The large number of lecturers and teaching assistants who are being trained are growing rapidly. All this shows that, relying on the existing political and business level, and constantly improving it, there is a wealth of potential to be tapped. Moreover, there are Soviet experts who are working hard to guide us.

Not only that, what is required of senior normal education at present is that there are many problems in the teaching work of secondary schools and in the guidance work of local education administrative organs, which are hoped to be helped by the teachers of senior normal schools. This is also the indispensable task of senior normal school teachers. However, this needs to be solved by strengthening practice and facing secondary schools, especially by relying on teachers' scientific research. Moreover, this aspect of work is closely related to the usual teaching, which can improve the quality of teaching in various subjects in senior normal schools. Therefore, this requires us to tap more potential and make more contributions. For example, since Beijing Normal University proposed to sign long-term mutual assistance contracts with secondary schools in Beijing, many secondary schools have taken the initiative to sign this contract, which reflects the secondary schools' hope for the teachers' university, and also increases the responsibility of the teachers of the teachers' university.

In the past, when implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, we often emphasized that our level was low, the conditions were poor, and we always wanted to lower the standards or delay the deadline. But after the practice personally guided by Soviet experts, it often proved that our subjective efforts were not enough, that we did not understand the development of objective things enough, that we did not study the theory enough .... From all this, can't we clearly see that it is precisely right-leaning conservatism that is hindering the high level of our potential?

Is the potential of teachers unlimited? My experience is that a person's potential can be gradually expanded with the improvement of his political awareness level and business level, and more importantly, it lies in awareness. Speaking of awareness, it is a matter of self-transformation. Although some people are not interested in the word transformation, the transformation of intellectuals with landlord class or bourgeois ideas into proletarian intellectuals is a rebirth, it is a change of heart, what is it if it is not transformation? To gradually grow into intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve socialism, we must go through the three interconnected ways that Premier Zhou said, which are all methods of self-education, and also the methods that our Party uses to help intellectuals carry out self-transformation. This means that self-transformation requires subjective efforts and objective conditions. Of course, the most important thing is subjective effort.

At the same time, another indispensable condition in giving full play to potential is to strengthen unity. In the past few years, due to certain reasons, in schools, there is sometimes a lack of harmony between the new and the old, between the Party and the masses, or there is a sense of alienation, which plays a negative role in giving full play to potential. At present, we have already been in the ranks of socialism, and the socialist construction of the motherland requires us to strengthen the fraternal alliance with workers and peasants, and the Party calls on us to serve socialism wholeheartedly. Any problems that were not harmonious in the past should be swept away when we join hands and stride towards socialism.

I have received a lot of education in this conference. The heroic deeds of Comrade Wang Yukun, Long Donghua, Huang Demao and other comrades are all examples for us intellectuals to learn from. I promise to do my best to transform myself in future study and work, so that I can truly be worthy of being a glorious member of the alliance with workers and peasants.

Shen Zou Ting's speech

In addition to fully agreeing with and wholeheartedly supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's political report and the various reports made by the leaders, because I am an intellectual, I would like to briefly express some of my feelings and opinions on the issue of intellectuals here.

I am now a professor at Beijing Railway Institute. Since 1932, I have been engaged in teaching in the field of railway transportation. I have always been very interested in training young people and researching railway transportation academics. Although my ability is limited, I have also put in some hard work in this area. However, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, no matter what intellectuals, especially teachers in schools, were not valued, and some people even thought that being a teacher was not promising. At that time, I certainly did not have a correct understanding of the reactionary regime, and there were still illusions. I thought that although I was not valued, I still had to study my major and express my opinions, hoping that one day my reformist ideas could be adopted and some "model railway" would appear. Then my efforts would not be wasted. Looking back today, I really feel naive and ridiculous.

After liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to intellectuals, science and technology, and cultural education. It stands to reason that an intellectual like me who could not express himself under the reactionary rule seems to be able to "show his skills", but things are not so simple. In the early days of liberation, I did not understand Russian, and I did not have the opportunity to learn advanced Soviet experience well. What I learned in the past was a set of American things, of course, many of which could not be applied. So at the beginning, I felt empty, and I wanted to learn but did not know how to learn well. After coming to Beijing in 1951, after the "Three Anti's" Movement and the ideological transformation movement, my political awareness was initially improved. Later, I learned to read Russian professional books and began to study advanced Soviet railway operation science, but in the past few years, on the one hand, my subjective efforts were not enough, and on the other hand, I was either busy or sick, so that I had more than enough heart and less than enough strength, and I did not learn well at all. As Premier Zhou said in the "Political Report", "Whether ... in terms of business level, or in terms of political awareness, they are still far from being able to meet the needs of the rapid development of socialist cause." This sentence seems to be directed at me. I felt very ashamed and terrified. But after thinking carefully, I felt that it was useless to be ashamed and terrified. Today, the Party and the government put the issue of intellectuals on the agenda. On the one hand, they expect us to contribute all our strength, and on the other hand, they want to improve our working conditions in every possible way, hoping that we can be quickly transformed and improved. As a senior intellectual, how can I use "ashamed" and "terrified" to answer the government's great call. On the contrary, I think I should put forward a long-term plan on how to transform and improve myself in the next twelve years, and help the school to formulate a comprehensive plan on the issue of intellectuals, so that I can be worthy of the Party and the country. Therefore, I want to talk about my views on these aspects.

I think the common problems of senior intellectuals are either arrogance or inferiority. In the past, I had the problem of arrogance, and today I have the problem of inferiority. The source of the disease is the same. In the future, I must get rid of these problems and study hard with humility and determination. I think although my ability is very poor, I still have a considerable foundation. As long as there is subjective effort, sufficient time, and a healthy body, I can definitely learn well. Regarding the issue of time, the government has made a very reasonable decision, and it will definitely be realized, so I don't need to worry about it. On my own side, there are two issues left, one is the issue of subjective effort, and the other is the issue of physical health. These two issues seem to be contradictory and not easy to solve. In fact, what I suffer from is hypertension. Although it is not suitable for tense and heavy work, it is not that there is no working ability at all. As long as I can make up my mind subjectively, I can still learn a lot in the next few years. So I am still prepared to discuss with the school authorities and formulate a long-term plan for me to improve myself in twelve years under the condition that my health is not very good, and strive to complete it. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." What's more, today there is the correct leadership of the Party, the help of comrades, the teaching of Soviet experts, plus subjective effort, how can there be no reason to "succeed". The government calls on us to bring our country's most urgent scientific departments close to the world's advanced level in twelve years. I resolutely respond to this great and solemn call and make my contribution to improving the level of science in our country!

In terms of political and ideological level, although I have improved compared to the early days of liberation, I am still far behind the needs of the socialist construction cause. In the future, in addition to strengthening political study and also formulating a study plan, I also have a wish, hoping to realize it as soon as possible. That is, I want to get closer to the Party, get closer to the Party members, learn their noble qualities, and strive for their help. In the past, the old intellectuals in our college had too little contact with the Party members, and some old professors did not even know the Party's general branch secretary. This is certainly due to the old intellectuals not striving to get closer to the Party, but on the one hand, it is also due to the Party members not getting closer to the old intellectuals. In the future, I hope that the Party members, especially the responsible leading comrades in the Party, will treat us as a family, give more help and education, gradually achieve ideological meeting, talk about everything, so as to understand the ideological situation and shortcomings of each intellectual and help them to transform and improve. I have already had such ideological preparation and will strive to achieve it.

In the specific planning of the school on the issue of intellectuals, there are still many practical problems that need to be solved reasonably. I hope to provide my opinions as much as possible when the school is planning, so that I can also contribute some strength in this area.

While improving my own political level and business level, I will also, on the basis of my original teaching experience, work with other teachers to improve teaching methods, compile professional textbooks, and jointly make certain achievements in cultivating the younger generation and expanding the ranks of intellectuals.

Zuo Zongqi's speech

Chairman, fellow members, fellow comrades:

This time I was invited to attend the CPPCC meeting, which made me more deeply understand that the sincere unity of the entire Chinese people is the source of all the strength of New China. Only Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party made an accurate estimate of this force as early as more than 30 years ago, and led it to release infinite light.

As a female educator and scientific worker, I feel extremely excited to see the great achievements of the motherland today and to hear the reports of Premier Zhou and President Guo this time. I would like to talk about the issue of intellectuals from the perspective of my own work position.

1. The vast majority of intellectuals are active, enthusiastic, and willing to contribute their strength to the motherland's socialist construction cause. However, at present, when many intellectuals encounter difficulties in their work, especially when their opinions are not valued by the leaders, they will unconsciously reduce their enthusiasm and even feel uneasy about their work. In the old society, intellectuals most admired a sentence, "Stay if you agree, leave if you disagree." Although it has now been recognized that this is absolutely incompatible with socialist construction, it has not been completely eliminated from the mind. In other words, the idea of being the master has not been truly established, and the organizational relationship is not regarded as a member of the organization, but as a friendship relationship.

On the other hand, when responsible comrades in the organs encounter cadres who put forward opinions that seem incorrect on the surface, do not think that the person who puts forward the opinions has ideological problems. If you are willing to humbly analyze and study opinions that are not correct on the surface, you can often find the other side of the problem or other problems, and you can improve your work as a result.

2. The teachers of higher education generally feel that there is not enough time for scientific research and teacher training. In big cities, the large number of meetings, the large number of social activities, and the lack of planning for meetings and activities are common reasons. But in the past, in areas with inconvenient transportation, especially in schools that were opened when the reactionary government was about to collapse, there were problems with the work that supported teaching, which was also an important reason. After liberation, although there has been some improvement in this regard, it still cannot keep up with the needs. This not only affects the work efficiency of teachers, but also affects the work mood of teachers. In addition to the relevant leaders should work hard to overcome it, non-teaching cadres should work hard to study business, teachers should also sincerely put forward appropriate suggestions to the relevant leaders to help improve.

In short, as long as the intellectuals and the responsible comrades work together, they will certainly be able to implement the central government's policy and guidelines on intellectuals well.

Chen Zhanmei's speech

Chairman, fellow members, fellow comrades:

I feel very honored to come back from overseas to participate in the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. At the same time, I also deeply realize that through such a seamless steel pipe-like great united force, the victorious completion of the motherland's socialist social construction cause is undoubtedly. I am an ordinary businessman who has lived overseas for a long time, and my political awareness level is poor, but I am confident that my enthusiasm for loving the motherland is not lagging behind. The various reports made by the leaders at the meeting are all national policy guidelines and correct plans. In addition to expressing my heartfelt agreement and support, I also guarantee that when I return overseas, I will definitely convey them to the overseas Chinese, so that they know that the motherland can achieve prosperity and strength in a very short time, thereby raising awareness and transforming themselves to meet the requirements of the motherland's socialist society. I would like to take this opportunity to report some of the situation of the overseas Chinese in Burma before and after liberation. Before liberation, the overseas Chinese in Burma, like the overseas Chinese in other places, were all concerned about the motherland and eagerly hoped that the motherland would be prosperous and strong. Whenever there were accidents abroad, they immediately stood up and shouted loudly, and donated money to save the country. During the Anti-Japanese War, the performance was particularly enthusiastic. In the past, the fake organizations stationed overseas consulates often had financial difficulties, and the overseas Chinese did not hesitate to plan and cope. Even if the staff had no cars to sit in, they would raise money to buy them. Even the cost of repairing the embassy, the overseas Chinese could be happy to donate.

After the liberation of the motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Chairman Mao, all construction has advanced by leaps and bounds. Due to the rapid progress in the country, the international status has increased accordingly. The psychology of the people in the overseas Chinese community has also undergone great changes. Due to the impact of the destruction of the Second World War, the overseas Chinese in Burma suffered a lot of property losses, and the general economic strength was not strong. Sometimes when unexpected events such as fires occurred, the local overseas Chinese, although there were organizations such as relief committees engaged in relief work, often received support from relevant domestic agencies in terms of economy. Therefore, welfare undertakings have made smooth progress in the overseas Chinese community in Burma. Before liberation, only the overseas Chinese helped the motherland, but after liberation, it was the opposite. The Communist Party led New China, so that infinite light shone on every corner of overseas. Therefore, the overseas Chinese in Burma generally spread the words that even children understand: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China." At present, the general ideological trend of the overseas Chinese in Burma is that young people, especially students, hope to return to the country to study or participate in construction work; the elderly deeply feel that seeing the motherland becoming strong is a great honor; general knowledgeable businessmen, inspired by new domestic things, are competing to work hard for social education and charitable public welfare undertakings in the place where they are located. Therefore, in recent years, general education and welfare undertakings in the overseas Chinese community have been universally improved and developed. In the welfare undertakings promoted by the Burma Overseas Chinese Relief Committee, there are two free clinics in Yangon and five free clinics in the suburbs, which regularly provide free medical treatment for the general overseas Chinese. Burmese areas such as Mandalay and Boshang also have local enthusiastic overseas Chinese organizations to serve the local overseas Chinese. All these new businesses that are supported by the mass of overseas Chinese are inseparable from the influence of the motherland's strength and progress.

At present, the overseas Chinese have two urgent wishes. One is to demand the early liberation of Taiwan and realize a completely unified situation. The other is that in the areas with many relatives of overseas Chinese in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, how many problems still exist. Some district and township cadres do not conscient

    在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上的发言
    赵经农的发言主席、各位委员：
    我这几天，听到了周总理和各位首长的报告，我完全同意，竭力拥护。
    我是天主教甘肃天水教区（包括武都专区）的代理主教。在我们的教区，解放6年以来，一切的宗教仪式和宗教活动，未曾停顿，也从来未受到干涉。我们教区的宗教爱国运动以及人民政府的一切政策法令也都很顺利的遵行着，没有分歧意见。原因是：当然由于党和宗教领导机构，很贤明正确的关怀，团结照顾了我们，使我们取消了一切的顾虑，与党和领导机构没有距离的可以商谈解决一切问题。次因是：在我们天水教区先搞通了神职人员的思想，取消了神职领导人员的不必要的顾虑。我们教区的每个神职人员都敢于无所畏惧的接近党，与党和领导机构亲切的周旋，协商解决一切有关爱国爱教的问题。当然也不是尽如人意的，件件事情迎合理想，不过总是取得了互相了解协商的原则，因此，上行下效打下了团结教徒、搞好爱国爱教的先决基础条件。但也不能否认的，教区内部，虽然搞好了团结，外来的打击却没有免得了。我们是曾受到了很大的精神打击的：我们的神甫和教徒到了有些地区，不能享受宗教典礼的权利，同时也有些地区的教徒，到我们的教区，不参加我们的宗教礼拜仪式。他们诬蔑诽谤我们是裂教，是叛教，是违背教义，是脱离教宗，因此我们受到了内心的很大打击和痛苦。但是几年来，我们始终不渝的屹立不动的坚持着我们的态度，终于受到了党和广大爱国人士的支持，没有锉败。到今天，我们的教区也很光荣的，没有发见隐藏着的严重现行反革命分子，这也是党和宗教领导机构的光荣胜利成果之一。
    帝国主义者和国内外的敌人，不甘心他们的失败，见到新中国一切都在突飞猛进一日千里的发展着，政治、军事、文化、外交等都有着灿烂辉煌的成果，事实俱在，不能否认了，不能诽谤了，但却借口共产党不信神，没有宗教信仰，不能与共产党合作，不能爱共产党所领导的国家等等的毁谤。但这都是与事实相反的错误。刘委员长在解释宪法时，周总理在亚非会议上，都曾作了详尽诚切的答复。事实上，各国访华代表团包括各宗教团体也都先后亲眼见到，亲耳听到，在共产党领导的新中国是有宗教信仰的。解放6年以来，还没有阻止或消灭了任何一个宗教。毛主席说：“信教的和不信教的各有他们的自由，不许加以强迫或歧视”。毛主席又曾对西藏致敬团说：“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰，今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”今天，我这一个脱离生产，多年来为祖国为人民毫无贡献的纯宗教职业的领导人，从辽远的西北，能来到首都参加这重要伟大的盛会，也就实实在在的的确确的具体兑现了毛主席的话和共产党的宗教政策。所以我希望我全国的天主教徒，尤其神职人员要加强学习，提高觉悟要大胆无畏，取消一切顾虑，诚诚恳恳，老老实实的来与全国爱国人士一道，团结在党和人民政府的周围，有话就讲，有事就谈，高高兴兴喜喜欢欢在新中国办好自己的爱国爱教双重重大任务，再不要摆荡不安犹豫徘徊的顾忌了。据我个人的体会，党是要团结一切可能团结的力量为建设祖国，也开诚布公的要团结我们中国的400万天主教徒。教内的同道们，请你们试试吧！
    其次，台湾是中国神圣不可分割的领土，我们一定要解放台湾，周总理在这个大会上，代表人民和中国政府宣布了：一切的人都可以回到祖国大陆，既往不究。所以我也希望台湾的天主教徒听到或看到周总理的宣布以后赶快大胆的回到祖国的怀抱！大陆的新中国决不干涉宗教信仰，相反的不加歧视的要保护和尊重，请台湾同胞来看看吧！
    在我从甘肃起身的时候，我们天水教区的神甫和教徒再三的叮咛我：到了首都不要忘了大家给毛主席和各位首长的敬意和候好，所以我在这里也以极诚恳敬心代表全天水教区敬祝毛主席和各位首长以及全体委员身体健康！最后并祝大会胜利成功！
    张轸的发言主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，并同意李、郭、陈、董各位副主席和陈伯达委员的报告。我这次到青岛、烟台一带视察渔业生产合作社和农业生产合作社，其中最突出的是烟台的幸福苹果生产合作社。现简单把这个合作社向各位介绍一下：
    烟台郊区有一个西沙旺，过去是一片荒沙，毫无人烟。据说解放前二三十年间，由外乡逃荒的饥民，逐渐盖起茅房，栉比而居，填土翻沙，种树植果。一般居民虽依靠苹果园地生活，但每亩的生产也不过一两百斤，终年劳苦，还不免于冻饿。更先后遭到日寇和蒋匪军的掠夺破坏，民众尤为贫苦，甚至流离失所，无家可归。
    解放后，由于党、人民政府的正确领导和积极支援，从互助到合作，大大提高了生产积极性，同时生产率也大大的提高。1953年由3个互助组成立了合作社，每个社员的劳动报酬就平均在600元上下。到1955年增产特大，每亩平均3，900斤，最高的产量每亩9，000余斤，这是空前所未有的。
    主要的增产原因：技术指导员章宗江同志苦心研究，基本上消灭了各种病虫害。对于修枝接种、排水防旱和施肥方面也有充分的经验。特别是领导上热心支持，也起了有力作用。烟台青香蕉苹果的品种，清香甘脆，不惟美冠全国，自行销香港、新加坡一带，把美国和日本的苹果市场完全压倒。可惜数量上还不够推销。
    据章宗江同志说：现科学技术逐渐提高，再过数年每亩可保证达到1万斤。烟台郊区可种植2万亩苹果（现有1万亩），将来远景更是光明。
    1955年，幸福苹果生产合作社除一切开支外，每一个劳动力最高可得1，100元，普通由600元至700多元，平均每人700多元，妇女平均360元。到1956年，男劳动力平均可得950元，女劳动力可得750元（因成立了托儿所）。每年以20％的公积金扩大再生产，并提福利金一部作救济和文化活动。整个物质生活和文化生活日益提高，今昔对比，真是天堂地狱。全村人民感戴共产党和毛主席，欢欣鼓舞不可言状，同时人人都从心坎里流出两句谚语：“西沙旺变做幸福村，穷沙滩成了金沙滩。”
    我现就这个事实，用非词非曲、非诗非歌的调儿，编一个顺口溜，尚请各位指教。
    题名“西沙旺变做幸福村，穷沙滩成了金沙滩。”
    昔日西沙旺，尽是穷沙滩，
    多少饥民披荆、斩棘、
    冒着艰辛危险、填土翻沙、
    把果木栽遍，却被那穷凶日寇、狠毒蒋匪，毁灭了无数田园。给多少老幼无辜成灾难。
    幸解放军来，立把群魅驱散，废封建、行土改，抗美援朝接连着镇反，这才教广大穷人把身翻。
    数年来这里情形逐年好转，试看今年最高产量，每亩九千余斤成定案，如此丰收从来少见，表现在修枝接种、治病杀虫、除草施肥、防涝防旱，积累了许多宝贵经验，领导有方起了作用更非浅。思想打通眼光放远，看旧日小农经济与我无缘，尖锐斗争，奋向社会主义迎头赶。
    那怕那寒风、烈日，终年常流汗，为的是适应工业化要求，不肯把园艺作风，落在他人后面，更响应毛主席号召，随着合作化高潮，将任务超额完成，努力向前发展。
    进一步提高技术，畅销中外赚得外汇，把建设支援。
    赢余利润按劳分配，每人便有七百余元，百分二十公积金扩大再生产，福利金，成立了托儿所，男女同工同酬真实现，提高了物质生活，文化生活也有所改变。
    群情鼓舞，老少欢腾，远大前途更无限，今昔对比，天上人间。
    感激毛主席，感激共产党，到处歌声一片。
    这就是“西沙旺变做幸福村，穷沙滩成了金沙滩”。
　　邓文翬的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    当我们祖国进入一个伟大的社会主义革命建设高潮时期，来召开这次会，我以无比的愉快的心情来参加。我完全拥护周总理的政治报告和其他领导同志的各项报告。
    我是一个77岁的老人，我一生也曾参加过不少革命，可是都失败了，对人民没有什么好处。而到今天，祖国仅仅解放6年多，在各方面就有如此伟大成就，并且细致的规划了今后美丽的发展远景，这是归功于中国共产党和天才的英明的毛泽东主席领导得好的结果。使我感到处在今天是无上的光荣与幸福。
    此次来开会前一个月，我到过江西九江县永安、港口两个区视察，亲眼看到农业合作化运动，在农村中已经取得了伟大的胜利，农民们掀起了一个走社会主义道路高潮，我所看到的贫农领导干部，他们领导大家办社，路线、方针掌握得很好，得到群众的拥护。各社员生产情绪高涨，朝气勃勃可爱，并且涌现了不少能干的积极的生产人物。我相信在全国范围内，今年内就可以完全实现半社会主义农业合作化，再过两年的时间就可以实现社会主义的农业合作化。而最近党中央又提出“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”草案，这个草案更加描绘了我国农业生产和农村工作的美丽光辉远景，给全国五万万农民指出了奋斗目标，我认为这个目标是可以实现的，是能够实现的。
    谈到国际局势，也是对我们非常有利的，我们可以大力地搞我们的社会主义革命建设，因为我们的事业是正义的事业，是深得全世界人心的，所谓得道者多助。而以美帝为首的侵略集团，他们所行是不义的，必自毙的，是失道寡助的。何况我们又有以苏联为首的社会主义和平阵营日益强大，是有足够的力量制止侵略集团的战争冒险。诚如周总理所揭示的，万一侵略集团敢于发动第三次世界大战，失败的，将不仅是这一个或那一个帝国主义国家，而是整个帝国主义体系。处在这么一个有利于我国的国际环境中，我们这些人，应该各自好好的自我改造，好好工作为人民服务。
    解放后人民政府对于我们，尤为对于像我这样年纪较老的人，照顾足够周到。就以我自己亲身的体会来说，觉得是很好。比如这次来开会，因为生病，而大会负责人对我照顾和各位医务工作人员的悉心治疗，胜过我的亲人。党和人民对我如此温暖关怀，只有深深感激！
    我年纪虽比较为大，但我深信在党的如此关怀鼓舞下，我能活到90岁至100岁。我今后要尽我的精力要为人民多做一点我能做的工作，才不辜负党和人民给我的光荣。
    我祝大会胜利成功，各位健康。
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    董渭川的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在这次会议中，先后听到了周恩来总理的政治报告、郭沫若院长的在社会主义
  革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告以及其他负责同志的四项重要报告，都使我感到无比的兴奋！这些报告反映了我们新中国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的各方面的伟大胜利。这些胜利是相互联系着的，是在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下的阶级斗争的全盘胜利，也正是马克思列宁主义在中国的胜利。在各项报告中不只总结了我们在政治、经济、文化教育……各方面所起的根本变化，并且还指出了今后努力的方向，特别是对于如何充分动员和发挥我国知识分子的力量问题，当作重点提出。这就使作为知识分子和教育工作者的我，不仅衷心拥护，并且不能不结合我自己的业务来考虑到过去、现在和未来的一些问题。此刻我要说的，就是有关这方面的话。
    周总理告诉我们：“在社会主义时代，比以前任何时代都更加需要充分地提高生产技术，更加需要充分地发展科学和利用科学知识。因此，我们要又多、又快、又好、又省地发展社会主义建设，除了必需依靠工人阶级和广大农民的积极劳动以外，还必须依靠知识分子的积极劳动，也就是说，必须依靠体力劳动和脑力劳动的密切合作，依靠工人、农民、知识分子的兄弟联盟。我们现在所进行的各项建设，正在愈来愈多地需要知识分子的参加。”这段话说明了新中国在进入了社会主义时代赋予知识分子的重大任务。这是中国历史上从来所没有的。“依靠工人、农民、知识分子的兄弟联盟”，这对于知识分子来说，是多么光荣呵！
    几年来，我国知识分子在党的团结、教育、改造下，已经起了根本的变化。但是无论在数量方面、在业务水平方面，在政治觉悟方面，都还不能适应社会主义事业急速发展的需要。这就成了当前突出的问题。拿我所从事的高等师范教育来说，它担负着给新中国培养教师的任务，不光培养中等学校的教师，还培养高等师范学校的教师，因此，它的任务是直接间接培养社会主义的新人；它是“工作母机”。可是在农业合作化的高潮之下，扫除文盲的问题来了，普及儿童义务教育的问题来了，给高等学校大量输送新生的问题来了，给愈分愈细的各种工作输送各级干部的问题来了，大量供给教科书和读物的问题来了，……这些迫不及待的问题都需要人力，也就是都需要师资。这些师资从哪里来呢？无疑问地要靠教育方面的工作母机。这问题，从数量方面看，就要高等师范学校大量招收学生，要用大班上课，用二部制、用函授等一切可能的办法来解决。高级师范学校本身的师资也不够，就要大量培养新生力量，如多留助教、多招研究生等等。只有这样做，才能扩大高级和中级教师的队伍。在这种情况下，就必然要求充分发挥现有教师的积极性。我们不是有些教师的工作量还不够吗？不是有些教师能超额完成任务吗？不是有些时间支配得不合理吗？不是有些会议太多太长或者不必要吗？不是有的老教师只带一两个徒弟甚或一个不带吗？如果切实规划，认真发动，应当说是有潜力可发挥的。谈到潜力，就不仅是数量问题，而且要求到质量了。
    质量问题中既包括着业务水平，更考验着政治觉悟。解放六年后的今天，教师们虽然在政治上进步的仍只占40％，但不论是中间的和落后的，也都在不同程度上继续进展着，变化着。论业务，在这几年来，经过对资产阶级唯心主义的批判，对苏联先进经验的学习，各科教研室的集体钻研和各个人自己的努力，也达到了一定的水平。一般老教师旧有的知识和方法，经过批判，也还不乏有用的部分。在培养中的大批讲师助教们正在飞速地成长着。这都说明，凭借现有的政治和业务水平，再加以不断地提高，是有丰富的潜力可挖掘的。况且还有苏联专家们在辛勤不倦地指导着我们呢。
    不仅如是，当前所要求于高级师范教育的是，中等学校的教导工作中以及地方教育行政机关的指导工作中都有许多问题，希望得到高级师范学校教师们的帮助。这也是高级师范学校教师义不容辞的任务。但是，这需要通过加强实践、面向中学来解决，尤其是要依靠教师们的科学研究来完成。并且，这方面的工作和平时的教学有着密切的关联，它能提高高级师范学校内各科教学的质量。因此，这就要求我们挖掘更多的潜力，作更多的贡献。举一个例子来说，自从北京师范大学提出和北京市的中学订立长期的互助合同以来，已经有许多中学主动争取签订了此项合同，这就反映了中学对师大的希求，也加重了师大教师们的责任。
    过去我们在执行苏联专家的建议上，常常强调自己的水平低，条件差，老想降低标准或者延迟期限。但经过苏联专家亲身指导的实践结果，又往往证明是我们的主观努力不够，是我们对于客观事物的发展情况了解得不够，是我们对理论钻研得不够……。从这一切不可以很明显地看到正是右倾保守思想在阻碍着我们潜力的高度发挥吗？
    教师们的潜力是不是无限大呢？我的体验是，一个人的潜力是能够随着他的政治觉悟水平业务水平的提高而逐步扩大的，并且更主要的还在于觉悟。说到觉悟，就是自我改造的问题了。尽管有的人对于改造这个字眼不感兴趣，但是有着地主阶级或资产阶级思想的知识分子转变为无产阶级的知识分子，是脱胎换骨，是革面洗心，不是改造是什么？要逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子，就必须通过周总理所说的那三个相互联系着的途径，那都是自我教育的方法，也是我们的党帮助知识分子进行自我改造的方法。这就是说，自我改造需要主观努力，也需要客观条件。当然更主要的还在于主观努力。
    同时在发挥潜力中的另一不可少的条件是加强团结。在这几年内，由于某些原因，学校中在新老之间、党群之间，有时不能融洽，或者存在着隔膜，这对于发挥潜力是起着消极作用的。当前我们已经置身于社会主义的行列，祖国的社会主义建设在要求着我们和工人、农民加强兄弟般的联盟，党号召我们全心全意为社会主义服务，过去的任何不够融洽的问题，应当在携起手来大踏步向社会主义迈进的时候，一扫而光了。
    我个人在此次大会中受到了很多的教育，像王玉坤、龙冬花、黄德茂等几位同志的英雄事迹，都是我们知识分子应当学习的榜样。我保证，尽我一切的力量，在今后的学习中和工作中努力改造自己，使自己真正称得起是和工人、农民联盟中的一个光荣的成员。
    沈奏廷的发言
    我除完全同意和衷心拥护周恩来总理的政治报告和各位首长所作的各项报告而外，因为我是一个知识分子，我愿意在这里对知识分子的问题简单地抒述我的一些感想和意见。
    我现在是北京铁道学院的教授。自从1932年起，我就从事于铁道运输方面的教学工作，对于培养青年和研究铁路运输学术，我是一向感有极大的兴趣的。虽然自己能力有限，但也曾经对这方面下过一些苦功。可是在国民党反动统治时期，无论什么知识分子，特别是学校里的教师，是不被人重视的，甚至有人认为当教师是没出息的。当时我对反动政权当然没有正确的认识，还存在着幻想，以为尽管不被人重视，我仍要钻研我的专业，发表我的意见，希望有一天我的改良主义主张能被采用，出现什么“模范铁路”，那时我的功夫就不是白费了。今天回想起来，实在感觉得幼稚可笑。
    解放后，党和政府就非常重视知识分子，重视科学技术和文化教育，照理说来，像我这样一个在反动统治之下不能抒展的知识分子，似乎可以“大显身手”了，但是事情并非如此简单。在解放初期，我不懂俄文，也没有机会很好地来学习苏联先进经验，过去所学的是美国的一套，当然很多是不能适用了。所以一开始就感觉到空虚，想学而不知怎样去学才好。1951年来到北京以后，经过“三反”运动及思想改造运动，政治觉悟初步有所提高，后来又学会了阅读俄文专业书籍，开始对苏联先进的铁路营运科学从事学习，但是这几年来，一方面由于主观努力还不够，一方面不是忙，就是病，以致心有余而力不足，根本没有学好。正如周总理在“政治报告”中所说的“无论……在业务水平方面、在政治觉悟方面，都还不能适应社会主义事业急速发展的需要。”这句话真好像是针对我说的。我听了真感到万分惭愧，万分惶恐。但是仔细思量一下，又觉得徒然惭愧和惶恐是没有用的。今天党和政府把知识分子问题提到日程上来，一方面期待我们贡献一切力量，一方面又无微不至地要改善我们的工作条件，希望我们能迅速得到改造和提高。作为一个高级知识分子，我岂可以拿“惭愧”和“惶恐”来回答政府这一伟大的号召。相反地，我想我应该提出今后十二年内如何改造和提高自己的远景计划来，并且帮助学校订出对知识分子问题的全面规划来，这样才能对得起党，对得起国家。因此，我要谈一谈我对这些方面的见解。
    我想高级知识分子的通病，不是自高自大，就是自卑自馁。过去我有自高自大的毛病，今天又犯上了自卑自馁的毛病，其病源是一样的。今后我一定要去掉这些毛病，虚心地、坚决地努力学习。我想我虽然能力很差，但还是有相当根底的。只要有主观的努力，充分的时间，健康的身体，一定可以学好。关于时间问题，政府已经作出了很合理的决定，一定会实现的，用不到我担心。在我自己方面，还余下两个问题，一个是主观努力问题，一个是身体健康问题。这两个问题看来是矛盾的，好像不容易解决。其实我所患的是高血压症，虽然不宜于紧张繁重的工作，但也不是一点没有工作能力，只须主观上能下定决心，在今后几年内还是可以学到很多的东西的。所以我仍准备在健康不太好的情况下，和学校当局商量，订出我十二年提高自己的远景计划，并且努力去完成它。古语说得好，“有志者事竟成”，何况今天有党的正确领导，同志们的帮助，苏联专家的教导，加上主观努力，岂有不“竟成”之理。政府号召我们要把我国最急需的科学部门在十二年之内接近世界先进水平，我坚决响应这一伟大庄严的号召，在提高我国科学水平方面，作出我的贡献！
    在政治思想水平方面，我虽然比解放初期已有所提高，但也还是远远落后于社会主义建设事业的需要的。今后除加强政治学习并也订出学习的计划以外，我还有一个愿望，希望能及早实现。这就是我要多多靠拢党，接近党内人士，学习他们的崇高品质，并争取他们的帮助。过去我院旧知识分子和党内人士接触实在太少了，有的老教授甚至还不认识党总支书记。这固然由于旧知识分子不争取靠拢党，但一方面也由于党员不接近旧知识分子。今后我希望党内人士尤其党内负责领导同志当我们是一家人一样，多多帮助教育，逐渐做到思想见面，无话不谈，从而摸清每一个知识分子的思想情况及其缺点，帮助其改造和提高。我已有了这样的思想准备，将努力争取其实现。
    在学校对知识分子问题的具体规划方面，其中还存在着不少的实际问题，亟须加以合理解决。我希望能在学校进行规划的时候，尽可能提供我的意见，使我能在这方面也贡献一些力量。
    在提高我自己的政治水平和业务水平的同时，我还要在我原有的教学经验基础上，和其他教师一道，努力改进教学方法，编好专业教材，在培养青年一代扩大知识分子的队伍方面，共同作出一定的成绩。
    左宗?的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这次我被邀列席政协会议，使我更深刻的体会到全中国人民的精诚团结，是新中国一切力量的源泉。唯有毛主席和中国共产党远在三十多年以前，就对这一股力量作了精确的估计，领导它放出了万丈光芒。
    作为一个女教育工作者和科学工作者，看到祖国今日已有的伟大成就，听到这次周总理和郭院长的报告，更感到无比的兴奋。我愿从自己工作岗位的角度来谈谈关于知识分子的问题。
    一、绝大多数的知识分子是积极的、热情的，愿意为祖国的社会主义建设事业，贡献出自己的力量。但是在目前，还有不少知识分子在工作中遇到困难时，特别是当自己的意见没有被领导重视的时候，便会不自觉地降低自己的积极性，甚至对工作不安心。在旧社会里，知识分子最欣赏一句话，“合则留，不合则去”。虽然现在已认识到这是和社会主义建设绝不相容的，却没有将它从思想中彻底清除出去。换句话说，是没有真正建立主人翁的思想，没有将自己作为组织的一员，而是将组织关系看作和友谊关系一样。
    另一方面，机关负责同志，遇到干部提出表面上看来是不正确的意见时，不要认为提意见的人是有思想问题。如果对于表面上不正确的意见，肯虚心分析研究，往往可以发现问题的另一方面或其他的问题，并能从而改进自己的工作。
    二、高等学校的教师，目前在科学研究和师资培养的工作方面，普遍感到时间不够。在大城市中，会议多、社会活动多，以及会议和活动的缺乏计划性是普遍的原因。但是在过去交通不便的地区，特别是在反动政府快垮台时开办的学校中，配合教学的工作上存在着问题，也是重要的原因。解放后，虽则在这方面有所改进，但还是赶不上需要的。这不但影响了教师的工作效率，也影响了教师的工作情绪。除有关领导应努力克服，非教学干部应努力钻研业务以外，教师也应当诚恳地向有关领导提出适当的建议，协助改进。
    总之，只要知识分子和负责同志双方共同努力，必然能很好地贯彻中央关于知识分子的政策方针。
    陈占梅的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我此次由海外回来参加中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议，内心感觉到非常荣幸。同时亦深刻认识到通过这样像无缝钢管般的伟大团结力量，祖国社会主义社会建设事业的胜利完成，是毫无疑义的。我是久居海外的一个普通商人，政治认识水平较差，但于爱护祖国热情，自信不甘落后。此次各首长在会上所作各项报告，都是国家施政方针与正确计划，我除表示衷心赞同拥护外，并保证回到海外时，必定认真地传达给各侨胞，使他们知道祖国在很短时间便能达到繁荣富强的地步，从而提高认识，改造自己，以符合祖国社会主义社会之要求。我在此顺便报告一些解放前后有关缅甸华侨的情况。在解放前，缅甸华侨与其他各地华侨一样，莫不关怀祖国，热望祖国富强。凡遇对外发生事故，立即群起大声疾呼，捐资救国。在对日抗战时，表现尤为热烈，在过去伪组织驻外领馆常常发生经费困乏，侨胞亦不吝啬筹谋应付。甚至工作人员无汽车可坐，亦集资买给。连修理使馆费用，侨胞亦能乐于捐助。
    祖国解放后，在中国共产党和英明领袖毛主席领导下，一切建设突飞猛进。由于国内进步迅速，国际地位随而日高。华侨社会人士的心理，亦起了很大的变化。因第二次世界大战破坏的影响，缅甸华侨财产损失甚多，一般经济力不强，有时遇到意外事如发生火灾，当地华侨，虽有救济委员会之组织，从事救济工作，但经济方面则常得到国内有关机关之支持。因此福利事业，在缅甸华侨社会中，得到顺利进展。解放前只有华侨帮助祖国，而解放后则相反。共产党领导新中国，使万丈光辉照到海外每一个角落。故缅甸华侨普遍流传连小孩亦懂的话：“没有共产党就没有新中国。”目前缅甸华侨一般思想的倾向，青年人尤其是学生都希望回国学习或参加建设工作；老年人则深深感到亲眼看到祖国富强，引为莫大的光荣；一般有识商人，受到国内新事物的感召，对所在地的社会教育及慈善公益事业，莫不竞相努力以赴。故近年以来，在华侨社会里一般教育和福利事业，均能普遍提高与发展。在缅甸华侨救济委员会推行福利事业中，仰光市就有二处义务诊疗所，及郊区五个义务诊疗站，经常为一般侨胞免费医治疾病。缅属如瓦城、勃生二处，亦由当地热心华侨组织同样机构，为该地侨胞服务。所有这些为大众侨胞所拥护的新生事业的出现，是与祖国强大和进步影响分不开的。
    目前海外侨胞有两个急切的愿望，其一就是要求早日解放台湾，实现完全统一局面。其二就是在福建、广东两省侨眷众多的地区，有多少问题，还存在着一些区乡干部对贯彻中央侨务政策不切实奉行，甚盼能得早日纠正与改善。最后敬祝各位同志身体健康，全心全意来共同为人民服务。
