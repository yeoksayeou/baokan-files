Several Explanations Regarding the Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme
China Language Reform Committee
1956.2.

1. Why is it Necessary to Draft a Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme?

The purpose of drafting a Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is to design a set of phonetic alphabets and spelling rules to spell Mandarin Chinese, which uses Beijing pronunciation as the standard, and is the common language of the Han nationality.

What are the uses of this Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme?

(1) It can be used to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters, in dictionaries, textbooks, popular readings, rare characters that need phonetic notation, road signs, etc. Chinese characters themselves cannot accurately represent pronunciation. Adding phonetic alphabets can accurately represent the standard pronunciation of Chinese characters. Applying this set of phonetic alphabets to teach Chinese characters makes it easier for teachers to teach and students to learn. People with limited literacy can rely on phonetic alphabets to recognize characters and can also read books and newspapers printed with phoneticized Chinese characters or with Chinese characters and phonetic alphabets in parallel.

(2) It can be used as a teaching tool for Mandarin Chinese. Learning Mandarin Chinese solely through listening and speaking makes it easy to forget what has been heard and said. With phonetic alphabets, one can learn Mandarin Chinese through phonetic reading materials. One can also check if the pronunciation is correct based on whether the phonetic transcription is accurate.

(3) It can be used as symbols in science and technology. This set of modern phonetic alphabets can be used to write scientific symbols and transliterations of specialized terms. It is especially convenient for sending telegrams, signaling with flags, sending signals, compiling indexes, arranging orders, etc. Our country is undergoing socialist economic construction and national defense modernization, and such a set of scientific and technical symbols is essential.

(4) It can be used to experiment with Chinese phonetic writing, so that Mandarin Chinese spelled with phonetic alphabets gradually develops into a complete phonetic writing system. No one can deny the great contribution of Chinese characters, but it is also a general trend that Chinese characters will be changed to phonetic writing in the future. There are also some difficulties in changing Chinese characters to phonetic writing, so a preparatory stage is needed. The exact difficulties in changing Chinese characters to phonetic writing, and how to overcome these difficulties, etc., all need to be studied and experimented in detail during this preparatory stage to find satisfactory answers. This requires first a phonetic scheme as a tool for research and experimentation.

(5) It can be used as the alphabet base for various minority ethnic groups to develop phonetic writing systems. Many minority ethnic groups in our country do not yet have writing systems and are preparing to develop phonetic writing systems. Some ethnic groups that already have writing systems are also preparing to improve their writing systems. With this phonetic scheme, all ethnic groups can use it as a common basis for the alphabet of phonetic writing systems, facilitating cultural exchanges between ethnic groups. In addition, various minority ethnic groups and foreign students in our country can also use this phonetic scheme to learn Chinese.

2. What Principles is the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Based On?

The Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme is mainly based on the following three basic principles:

I. Phonetic Standard. In order to unify the pronunciation of Chinese, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme spells Mandarin Chinese, which uses Beijing pronunciation as the standard – the common language of the Han nationality. The phonetic alphabets annotated in dictionaries, textbooks, and other reading materials all use this pronunciation as the standard. This scheme can also spell the various dialects of Chinese and the languages of various minority ethnic groups with slight additions and adaptations.

II. Syllable Structure. Adopt the "phonemic" syllable structure. A "phoneme" is a unit of speech sound. Each Chinese character corresponds to a syllable in Chinese. For example, "乖" (guai) is a syllable. Analyzing this syllable, it is composed of four phonemes: g, u, a, i (ㄍ [ge], ㄨ [wu], ㄚ [a], l [yi]). A Chinese syllable contains at least one phoneme, generally two or three, and at most four. In this scheme, the number of letters written corresponds to the number of phonemes; one letter represents one phoneme, and the method of combining two or three phonemes into one letter is generally not adopted. This is not only in accordance with scientific principles, but also has two important advantages in practical application: it reduces the number of letters and facilitates changes in spelling. For example, the three letters u, a, i can be spelled as "歪" (uai), "腰" (iau), and can also be spelled as u-ai, ua-i, u-ia, ui-a, a-ui, aiu, au-i, a-iu, ia-u, i-au, i-ua, etc. The Zhuyin alphabet would require seven letters to spell these sounds: ㄨ (wu), ㄞ (ai), ㄧ (yi), ㄠ (ao), ㄚ (a), ㄡ (ou), ㄟ (ei).

III. Letter Forms. Adopt the internationally used Latin alphabet, with necessary additions. First, a systematic Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme (draft) is drafted using Latin letters, using one letter to represent one phoneme as much as possible. Where a phoneme needs to be represented by two Latin letters, or where a phoneme cannot be appropriately represented by existing Latin letters, new letters are added. In such cases, the existing Latin letters are still prescribed as "substitute forms" for foreign translation and application on existing mechanical equipment.

We added a total of five new letters. The Zhuyin letters ㄓ (zhi), ㄔ (chi), ㄕ (shi), and 兀 (the Shanghai pronunciation of "额" [e]) are written as zh, ch, sh, ng according to Western European custom, but this is cumbersome to write (for example, "双" [shuang] would be spelled shuang). Now we change them to ?、?、?、?. These four letters are all based on the original Latin letters with appropriate changes, and the latter two are existing symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet. The Zhuyin letter ㄐ (ji) was previously commonly represented by g or i, but these two letters have already been assigned other pronunciations in the scheme, so we changed it to the Russian letter ч (which also resembles the shape of the Zhuyin letter ㄐ). These five letters still use zh, ch, sh, ng, g as substitute forms.

The use and arrangement of letters should meet the following requirements as much as possible:

(1) Adapt to the general habits of modern countries using Latin letters and our country's past use of Latin letters. Although the application of Latin letters varies in modern countries, there are generally more common standards. In order to adapt to the characteristics of Chinese pronunciation, we need to change the pronunciation of certain letters to some extent. However, in order to facilitate the absorption of internationally used scientific terms and international cultural exchanges, we should conform to or approximate general international habits as much as possible. At the same time, there is a relatively long tradition of using Latin letters to spell Chinese in China. Among the various schemes for spelling Mandarin Chinese, the Guoyu Romazi and the Latinized New Writing of Northern Dialect have a greater impact. The Guoyu Romazi has been adopted in several dictionaries, which are still in use today. The Latinized New Writing of Northern Dialect has spread widely and is still used in the Northeast Railway Telegraph. Although these two schemes have their own strengths and weaknesses, they also have many common advantages that can be used as the basis for the new scheme. We have tried our best to accept this tradition.

(2) Use only one letter for one phoneme, making spelling simple, clear, and easy to teach. In order to facilitate writing and to add tone symbols to the letters when necessary, the new letters generally avoid adding symbols above them.

(3) Save the total number of letters. The total number of letters should be appropriately reduced under reasonable conditions, especially the new letters should not be increased arbitrarily, so as to facilitate application in printing, typing, telegraphing, and other machinery and technology. Too many letters will cause certain difficulties, at least reducing work efficiency. The current scheme adds five new letters to the commonly used twenty-six Latin letters, and reduces one V (V is still used as a scientific symbol and in some other places), for a total of thirty, which is seven fewer than the total number of Zhuyin letters.

(4) Pay appropriate attention to systematization. In order to express the phonetic characteristics of Chinese and to facilitate teaching and general application, the phonetic scheme should be as systematic as possible. For example, ㄗ (zi), ㄘ (ci), ㄙ (si) are represented by Z, C, S, and ㄓ (zhi), ㄔ (chi), ㄕ (shi) are represented by ?、?、?, systematically indicating the contrast between these two groups of sounds in modern Chinese. This is very convenient for people in dialect areas and minority ethnic groups to learn Mandarin Chinese.

All these principles are relative, not absolute, and there are some contradictions between them. These principles should be considered comprehensively in order to design a more perfect scheme.

3. Why Use Latin Letters?

Regarding the question of what form of letters to use for the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme, the China Language Reform Committee has conducted multi-faceted research for a long time. Comrades enthusiastic about language reform in various places have also put forward many valuable opinions. At the National Language Reform Conference in October 1955, the Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Committee of the China Language Reform Committee proposed 6 draft Chinese phonetic alphabet schemes, of which 4 were Chinese character stroke style, one was Slavic alphabet style, and one was Latin alphabet style. After careful consideration, it was decided to use Latin letters.

Why was this decision finally made after long consideration? This is because, from all angles, using Latin letters is more beneficial.

Latin letters are the most commonly used letters in the world today. It was originally the alphabet of ancient Latin. It originated in Greece and was formed in Rome, so it is also called the Roman alphabet.

Latin letters have a relatively long historical tradition in China. 350 years ago, Latin letters began to be used as symbols for phonetic annotation of Chinese characters. 100 years ago, it was used to spell various local dialects. 50 years ago, Chinese scholars began to advocate the use of the world's common Latin letters to formulate China's phonetic writing system. In addition to many schemes for Mandarin Chinese and dialects, the Guoyu Romazi scheme was produced in 1926, and the Latinization scheme of the Northern Dialect was produced in 1931. The historical and mass foundation of Latin letters in China gives us the benefit of taking advantage of the situation today.

Latin letters are indispensable in modern science. Algebra and geometry require the use of abc and xyz, etc.; chemistry, physics, and other sciences also use these letters. Internationally used scientific terms, such as the scientific names of organisms, are generally written in Latin letters. In countries that do not use Latin letters as their writing system, students in middle schools and above must also learn Latin letters.

Latin letters have simple strokes and clear shapes, making them convenient for reading and writing. Moreover, many ethnic groups have used Latin letters for a long time and have created many flexible application methods, giving this set of letters great adaptability. After appropriate adaptations and additions, it can be completely adapted to the requirements of Chinese, completely and correctly spelling our pronunciation, and will not cause any harm to the purity and health of our language. It can express the phonetic characteristics of our Chinese, not only can the tones be correctly represented, but also the forms of homophones can be distinguished when necessary.

Latin letters, although foreign in origin, can completely obey our command and faithfully serve us. In our draft scheme, after revision and addition, the pronunciation and usage of Latin letters are completely Chinese pronunciation and usage. It has become our own Chinese alphabet, no longer the alphabet of ancient Latin, let alone the alphabet of English, French. Correctly speaking, it can only be called the Chinese phonetic alphabet, just as the letters of English, French, Polish, and Czech can only be called English letters, French letters, Polish letters, and Czech letters. The writing composed of this set of letters and the articles written are the phoneticized Chinese characters and Chinese writing.

Similar to Latin letters, the Slavic alphabet is also commonly used internationally. Both of these alphabets evolved from the Greek alphabet and can be used as tools for spelling Chinese. We adopted Latin letters and did not adopt Slavic letters only because Latin letters have a relatively long historical tradition in our country, and their pronunciation is easier to adapt. Students in the Soviet Union also learn Latin letters, so our adoption of Latin letters does not cause difficulties in cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union. On the other hand, our adoption of Latin letters greatly increases the convenience of cultural exchanges between our country and Southeast Asian countries.

Some people may think that adopting foreign letters is not in line with the patriotic feelings of our people. This is a misunderstanding.

Adopting letters that are conducive to the economic and cultural development of our country is completely in line with the principles of patriotism. Mr. Lu Xun and Comrade Qu Qiubai are great patriots of our country, and they are the most enthusiastic advocates of the Latinization of Chinese characters. Comrade Qu Qiubai was also the original drafter of the Latinization scheme of the Northern Dialect. Their participation in the Chinese character reform and Latinization movement is a concrete manifestation of their love for the motherland and concern for the interests of the nation.

Letters are similar to trains, ships, cars, and airplanes, and have no class nature. Whoever uses it, it serves whomever. The letters used by countries around the world today are almost all foreign, but after accepting foreign letters, each country has made modifications according to its own needs. For example, the letters of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Poland, and Czechoslovakia all borrow Latin letters, Latin letters and Slavic letters both originate from Greek letters, Greek letters come from Phoenician, and Phoenician letters were formed under the influence of ancient Egyptian writing. But this has not made the people of the countries concerned feel any hindrance to their national self-esteem. Arabic numerals, symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, ratio, percentage, etc., various scientific symbols, and even the Gregorian calendar and the metric system, etc., are all commonly used worldwide and have not hindered the national self-esteem of the people of various countries. Therefore, concerns about adopting foreign letters are unnecessary.

4. Why Not Use Zhuyin Letters or Create Another Set of Chinese Character Stroke-Style Letters?

Zhuyin letters were drafted in 1913 and promulgated in 1918. For nearly 40 years, Zhuyin letters have made considerable contributions to unifying the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Its historical achievements are indelible.

As its name suggests, Zhuyin letters are for phonetic annotation of Chinese characters, and are suitable for annotating the pronunciation of Chinese characters in dictionaries or language textbooks. However, it is not suitable as the alphabet for the future Chinese phonetic writing system.

Each Zhuyin letter looks like an independent Chinese character, because these symbols originally came from ancient Chinese characters. When used for phonetic spelling, this independence of each letter is a major disadvantage. Even if several letters are pieced together, they are still scattered in our vision, and it is not easy to give people a sense of unity, and it is not easy to create the impression of a whole word. This disadvantage is not obvious when annotating individual Chinese characters, but it becomes very prominent when spelling a sentence or an entire paragraph away from Chinese characters.

Zhuyin letters are not convenient for cursive writing and connecting. Some letters, such as: ㄑ (qi) and ㄥ (eng), ㄋ (ne) and ㄎ (ke), ㄊ (te) and ㄘ (ci), can still be distinguished in regular script, but they are easily confused in cursive script. The strokes of Zhuyin letters are tortuous and not easy to connect; if they are forced to connect, they become quite complicated characters, making reading difficult and prone to errors.

The number of Zhuyin letters is as many as 37. Because some letters represent two phonemes (for example, ㄢ (an) = an), which are not easy to change, the letters are very inflexible despite their large number. It is still very inconvenient to use it to spell dialects, minority ethnic languages, and foreign proper nouns, place names, and scientific terms, even if some symbols are added.

We hope to have a set of phonetic letters that can be used as a tool for phonetic annotation of Chinese characters and Mandarin Chinese spelling, and at the same time be able to adapt to the requirements of science and technology, and gradually develop into a phonetic writing system for Chinese in the future. Such hopes are difficult to achieve with Zhuyin letters. This is why the attempt to replace Zhuyin letters with Latin letters came about very early. Just looking at the Guoyu Romazi, which was produced not long after the Zhuyin letters were drafted, is enough to understand.

Why don't we create another set of Chinese character stroke-style letters that are better than Zhuyin letters?

It is not difficult to create a set of Chinese character stroke-style letters, but it is very difficult to create them well and make everyone satisfied.

The graphics of new letters can be infinitely possible. Which graphic is good and which is bad is a matter of opinion. It is not easy for a set of newly created letters to be agreed upon by a considerable number of people, and it is even more difficult to get the unanimous consent of the broad masses. Letters are habitual symbols, and letters without a historical basis are difficult to win the support of the masses.

Chinese character stroke-style letters are not easy to adapt to the requirements of modern writing that are both concise and easy to recognize, and can be written in one stroke. Chinese character cursive script can be written in one stroke, but it is not concise and easy to recognize, because cursive script is not a connected writing of simple strokes, but a connected writing of entire Chinese characters. In the use of technology such as typing, telegraphing, and printing, modern writing also requires that letters be arranged in a line of rows. Forcibly arranging and connecting Chinese character stroke-style letters in this way loses the style of Chinese character strokes, and therefore cannot meet the original intention of creating Chinese character stroke-style letters.

In the past 60 years, many people have created Chinese character stroke-style letters. Zhuyin letters are one of the more mature examples. Since liberation, comrades enthusiastic about language reform in various places have created many sets of letters derived from Chinese character strokes. From 1952 to 1954, the China Language Reform Research Committee concentrated the creation of the masses and drafted several sets of Chinese character stroke-style letters. All of these, from the whole point of view, are not as satisfactory as the internationally used letters. After five or six years of trial and error, the China Language Reform Committee obtained the consent of the leadership and abandoned the attempt to create Chinese character stroke-style letters. Of course, the trial and error during this period was not in vain, because if we had not gone through this journey, then we might still be wandering at the crossroads, and we would have no way to propose this draft Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme.

5. What Was the Drafting Process of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme (Draft)?

In October 1949, the China Language Reform Association was established in Beijing and began to study the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. After the China Language Reform Research Committee was established in February 1952, a phonetic alphabet scheme group was set up, making the study of the phonetic alphabet scheme one of its main tasks. From 1952 to 1954, the research work of the Chinese character stroke-style phonetic alphabet scheme was mainly carried out. At the end of 1954, the China Language Reform Research Committee was reorganized into the China Language Reform Committee. In February 1955, a Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Committee was established within the committee, conducting a more comprehensive and systematic study of the phonetic alphabet scheme.

In October 1955, at the National Language Reform Conference, the Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Committee proposed four draft Chinese character stroke-style schemes, one Slavic alphabet style scheme draft, and one Latin alphabet style scheme draft, which were distributed to the delegates for comments and criticism.

After the National Language Reform Conference, the China Language Reform Committee, based on the opinions of the masses and with the consent of the leadership, decided in principle to adopt the Latin alphabet style phonetic scheme draft. On January 10, 1956, the Fourth Plenary Session of the China Language Reform Committee discussed the draft proposed by the Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Committee, and after making another revision, unanimously passed it. This is the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme draft that is now published for discussion by all parties.

From the period of the China Language Reform Association in 1950 to August 31, 1955, 633 comrades enthusiastic about language reform in various places sent 655 Chinese phonetic alphabet schemes. These schemes came from various provinces and regions across the country, including remote provinces and brotherly national autonomous regions; several schemes were also sent from overseas. The comrades who drafted the schemes included various different social components, including teachers and students at all levels of schools, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteers, staff members of factories, mines, shops, and institutions, and overseas Chinese. The content of the schemes was also varied: there were Chinese character stroke-style, Slavic alphabet style, Latin alphabet style, and other special forms.

These phonetic alphabet schemes, taken separately as individual schemes, are inevitably flawed or not comprehensive enough; but if they are viewed as a whole, then they are a very valuable reference material. Almost all possibilities of Chinese phoneticization have been tried. The Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Committee studied these materials and discussed them based on their content. It can be said that the 633 creators of these 655 schemes worked together with the staff of the China Language Reform Committee and its Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Committee. Although they did not participate directly, they indirectly participated in the drafting of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme draft now proposed.

In drafting this Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme draft, it referred to dozens of major schemes over the past 300 years in a vertical direction; in a horizontal direction, it referred to more than 600 drafts sent by comrades from all over the country since liberation; in addition, it also referred to the research and experience of Vietnam, North Korea, Japan and other countries that had used Chinese characters in language reform. Therefore, the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme draft proposed this time is really a collective creation of the broad masses and a preliminary summary of historical experience.

Naturally, this draft must still have many shortcomings. We publish it in order to solicit criticism and opinions from all sides, so as to serve as the basis for further modification, because we firmly believe that only through everyone's discussion and criticism can it be made more perfect.

6. What Important Different Opinions Were There During the Drafting Process?

The China Language Reform Committee and its Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Committee had many different opinions and heated debates in the long-term discussion of the phonetic alphabet scheme, from principle issues to specific issues. However, each issue was resolved by unanimous agreement after research and debate.

Due to space limitations, only a few important issues that have been debated will be briefly reported here:

I. On the Question of Phonetic Standard. Some people advocated taking Beijing pronunciation as the standard and describing it truthfully, spelling it as Beijing people say it. Some people advocated taking Beijing pronunciation as the basis, and systematically distinguishing "jian and tuan sounds" on this basis (for example, "新" [xin] is written as sin, and "欣" [xin] is written as xin, not both written as xin). Later, everyone unanimously agreed to take Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation and not systematically distinguish jian and tuan sounds.

II. On the Question of Syllable Structure. Some people advocated adopting a double-spelling style, that is, using at most two letters to spell a syllable, some people advocated a triple-spelling style, and some people advocated a "phonemic" spelling style. Later, everyone unanimously agreed to adopt the "phonemic" spelling style.

III. On the Question of Tone. Some people advocated that all tones should be marked, and some people advocated that tones should only be marked on words with the same pronunciation but different tones. Later, everyone agreed that tones should be fully marked in textbooks for pronunciation teaching (such as dictionaries, dictionaries, etc.), but transliterations of foreign words and onomatopoeic words, etc., should not be marked; other books and periodicals can omit tones where they are not necessary. Detailed measures will be further stipulated later.

IV. On the Writing of ㄓ (zhi) ㄔ (chi) ㄕ (shi). Initially, most advocated using zh, ch, sh. Some also proposed using three Russian letters, or using other Latin letters, and some advocated creating three new letters. On the eve of the National Language Reform Conference, everyone agreed to use zh, ch, sh as the official writing, and use Z, C, S with a "belt" (that is, adding a short horizontal line in the middle of the three letters Z, C, S) as the substitute form. At the end of 1955, after discussion, it was changed to use ?、?、? as the official letters, and use zh, ch, sh as the substitute form.

V. Whether or not the vowels of the seven syllables such as "知痴诗日资雌思" (zhi chi shi ri zi ci si) should be written out. The majority advocated writing out this vowel, but some people did not approve of writing it out. Later, everyone unanimously agreed to write out this vowel, but not to use an independent letter, but only to borrow a variant of i, that is, a small capital letter to represent it. This vowel does exist, so there must be a letter to represent it; but this vowel is difficult to pronounce independently, so for the convenience of teaching, it is not listed as an independent letter in the alphabet.

VI. On the Writing of ㄐ (ji) ㄑ (qi) ㄒ (xi). Some people advocated using ㄍ (ge) ㄎ (ke) ㄏ (he) to also represent ㄐ ㄑ ㄒ (gi, ki, hi), some people advocated using ㄓ (zhi) ㄔ (chi) ㄕ (shi) to also represent ㄐ ㄑ ㄒ (?i, ?i, ?i), and some people advocated using three independent letters to represent them. Finally, it was decided to use a new letter ч (Russian letter) to represent ㄐ, and use q, x to represent ㄑ, ㄒ.

VII. The question of whether i (yi) and w (wu) are needed. Some people advocated not having i and w, and using i (衣) and u (乌) regardless of whether they are at the beginning or in the middle of a syllable. Some people advocated having the distinction between i, w and i, u. Later, everyone unanimously agreed to have i and w, because if i and w are not used, the syllables of many words will be unclear, for example, "主义" (?uii) and "赘" (?ui), "礼物" (liwu) and "溜" (liu) would be confused. If tone marks are used to separate the syllables, too many marks would be used, making writing inconvenient and unsightly.

In addition, there were many minor differences of opinion, which were resolved by unanimous decision after discussion, and will not be mentioned here.

### 关于拟订汉语拼音方案（草案）的几点说明

    关于拟订汉语拼音方案（草案）的几点说明
    中国文字改革委员会
　　　　　1956.2．
    1．为什么要拟订汉语拼音方案
    拟订汉语拼音方案的目的，是要设计一套拼音字母和写法规则，来拼写以北京语音为标准音的普通话，也就是汉民族共同语。
    这个汉语拼音方案有哪些用处呢？
      （1）可以用来给汉字注音，在字典上用，在教科书上用，在通俗读物上用，在需要注音的生僻字上用，在路牌上用，等等。汉字本身不能正确地表示读音，注上拼音字母，就可以把汉字的标准读音正确地表示出来。应用这套拼音字母教学汉字，教师容易教，学生容易学。识字不多的人可以依靠拼音字母来认字，还可以阅读用注音汉字印的或者汉字和拼音字母对照的书报。
      （2）可以用来作为普通话的教学工具。单凭耳朵和嘴巴学习普通话，听过、说过容易忘记；有了拼音字母，就可以通过普通话的拼音读物来学习普通话；还可以根据记音的是否正确，来检查发音的是否正确。
      （3）可以用来作为科学上和技术上的符号。这一套现代化的拼音字母，可以用来写科学符号和专门名词的译音。特别是打电报、打旗语、打信号、编索引、排顺序等等，用起来很方便。我国正在进行社会主义的经济建设和国防的现代化，这样一套科学和技术的符号是必不可少的。
      （4）可以用来试验汉语拼音文字，使拼音字母拼写的普通话逐步发展成为完善的拼音文字。汉字的伟大功绩是没有人能够否认的，但是汉字将来要改为拼音文字，那也是大势所趋。汉字改为拼音文字也有一些困难，因此需要一个准备阶段。汉字改为拼音文字究竟有哪些困难，这些困难怎样克服等等问题，都需要在这个准备阶段里，经过详细的研究和试验，找出完满的答案。这就首先需要有一个拼音方案作为进行研究和试验的工具。
      （5）可以用来作为各少数民族制定拼音文字的字母基础。我国少数民族中有好些民族还没有文字，正在准备制定拼音文字。有些已有文字的民族，也准备改进他们的文字。有了这个拼音方案，各民族就可以用它作为拼音文字的字母表的共同基础，便利民族之间的文化交流。此外，各少数民族和在我国的外国留学生还可以用这个拼音方案来学汉语。
    2．汉语拼音方案是根据什么原则拟订的
    汉语拼音方案主要是根据以下三个基本原则拟订的：
    一、语音标准。为了统一汉语的语音，汉语拼音方案拼写的是以北京语音为标准音的普通话——汉民族共同语。在字典上、教科书上和其他读物上注的拼音字母，都用这种语音作标准。这个方案只要稍加补充和变通，也可以拼写汉语的各种方言和各少数民族的语言。
    二、音节结构。采用“音素化”的音节结构。所谓“音素”，就是语音的单位。每一个汉字相当于汉语里的一个音节。例如“乖”（guai）就是一个音节。这个音节分析起来是由g、u、a、i（ㄍ〔哥〕、ㄨ〔乌〕、ㄚ〔啊〕、l〔衣〕）四个音素组成的。汉语的一个音节最少包含一个音素，一般地有两三个音素，最多有四个。在这个方案里，有几个音素就写几个字母；一个字母代表一个音，素一般不采取两个或三个音素合并起来用一个字母代表的办法。这样不但合乎科学原理，而且在实用上有两个重要的好处，就是减少了字母的数目，并且在拼法上便于变化。例如u、a、i三个字母，既可以拼成“歪”（uai），又可以拼成“腰”（iau），还可以拼成u－ai，ua－i，u－ia，ui－a，a－ui，aiu，au－i，a－iu，ia－u，i－au，i－ua等等的音。而注音字母拼这些音就要用ㄨ（乌）、ㄞ（哀）、ㄧ（衣）、ㄠ（熬）、ㄚ（啊）、ㄡ（殴）、ㄟ（欸）七个字母。
    三、字母形式。采用国际通用的拉丁字母，加以必要的补充。首先用拉丁字母拟订一个有系统的汉语拼音方案（草案），尽量用一个字母代表一个音素。遇到一个音素需要用两个拉丁字母来表示的地方，或者某音素不能十分适当地用现成的拉丁字母来表示的地方，就补充新字母。在这种地方，仍旧规定用现成的拉丁字母作为“代用式”，以便在国外译写，并在现有的各种机械设备上应用。
    我们补充的新字母共有五个。注音字母的ㄓ（知）、ㄔ（痴）、ㄕ（诗）、兀（上海音“额”）四个音，按西欧习惯写成zh、ch、sh、ng，但是这样写起来比较累赘（例如“双”要拼成shuang），现在改用?、?、?、?。这四个字母都是根据原来拉丁字母加以适当改变的，后两个还是国际音标里现成的符号。注音字母里的ㄐ（基），过去习惯用g或i来表示，但是这两个字母已经在方案中规定作别的读音，所以改用俄文字母ч（和注音字母ㄐ的字形也相像）。这五个字母仍旧用zh、ch、sh、ng、g作为代用式。
    字母的运用和安排，尽量做到满足下面几点要求：
    （1）适应现代各国运用拉丁字母和我国过去运用拉丁字母的一般习惯。拉丁字母在现代各国文字里面应用，虽然各有各的变通用法，可是大体上有比较通行的标准。为了适应汉语语音的特点，我们需要在一定程度内改变某些字母的读法。可是为了便于吸收国际通用的科学术语和便利国际文化交流，应该尽可能符合或者接近一般的国际习惯。同时，用拉丁字母拼写汉语，在中国也有相当长久的传统。在各种拼写普通话的方案中，影响比较大的是国语罗马字和北方话拉丁化新文字。国语罗马字在好几种字典里采用过，这些字典今天还有人使用。北方话拉丁化新文字传播很广，现在东北铁路电报还在应用。这两个方案虽然各有短长，但是也有不少共同的优点可以作为新订方案的基础。我们尽量接受了这种传统。
      （2）一个音素只用一个字母，使拼法简单、明确，便于教学。为了便于书写，并且为了在必要的时候在字母上加声调符号，新字母的上面一概避免附加符号。
      （3）节约字母总数。字母总数应当在合理条件下适当地减少，特别是新字母不可随意增加，这样才能便于在印刷、打字、电报和其他机械和技术上应用。字母过多会产生一定的困难，至少要减低工作效率。现在的方案比通用的二十六个拉丁字母增加了五个新字母，减少了一个Ⅴ（Ⅴ作为科学符号和在别的一些地方还要用），共为三十个，比注音字母总数少七个。
      （4）适当地注意系统化。为了表达汉语的语音特点，为了便利教学和一般应用，拼音方案应该尽可能地做到系统化。例如：ㄗ（资）、ㄘ（雌）、ㄙ（思）用Z、C、S表示，ㄓ（知）、ㄔ（痴）、ㄕ（诗）用?、?、?表示，系统地表明了现代汉语中这两组音的对比。这对方言区和少数民族学习普通话有很大方便。
    以上这些原则都是相对的，不是绝对的，它们相互之间还有些矛盾。这些原则应该全面地加以考虑，才能够设计出一个比较完善的方案。
    3．为什么要采用拉丁字母
    关于汉语拼音方案采用什么形式的字母的问题，中国文字改革委员会曾经长时间进行过多方面的研究。各地热心文字改革的同志们也提出过很多有价值的意见。在1955年10月全国文字改革会议的时候，中国文字改革委员会的拼音方案委员会提出了6种汉语拼音方案草案，其中4种是汉字笔画式的，一种是斯拉夫字母式的，一种是拉丁字母式的。经过详细考虑，决定采用拉丁字母。
    为什么在长期考虑之后，终于这样决定呢？这是因为从各个角度来看，采用拉丁字母比较有利。
    拉丁字母是现在世界上最通用的字母。它原来是古拉丁文的字母。源出于希腊，形成于罗马，所以也叫罗马字母。
    拉丁字母在中国已经有相当长久的历史传统。350年前，拉丁字母就开始被用来作为汉字注音的符号。100年前，就被用来拼写各地方言。50年前，中国的学者们开始提倡采用世界通用的拉丁字母来制定中国的拼音文字。在许多种普通话和方言的方案以外，1926年产生了国语罗马字方案，1931年又产生了北方话拉丁化方案。拉丁字母在中国的历史基础和群众基础，使我们今天采用它有因利乘便的好处。
    拉丁字母是现代科学里所不能不用的。代数学和几何学都要用到abc和xyz等等字母；化学、物理和其他科学里也同样要用到这些字母。国际通用的科学术语，例如生物的学名等等，一般是用拉丁字母书写的。在不用拉丁字母作为文字的国家，中等以上学校的学生也得学习拉丁字母。
    拉丁字母笔画简单，构形清楚，在阅读和书写上都方便。而且，许多民族长期使用拉丁字母，创造了不少灵活应用的方法，使这套字母有很大的适应性。经过适当的变通和补充以后，可以使它完全适应汉语的要求，完全正确地拼写我们的语音，对于我们的语言的纯洁和健康不会有丝毫的损害。它可以表达我们汉语语音的特点，不仅声、韵、调可以正确地表示，而且必要的时候还可以区分同音词的词形。
    拉丁字母，尽管从它的来源说是外来的，但是它能完全听从我们的调度，忠实地为我们服务。在我们的方案草案中，经过修正和补充，拉丁字母的读法和用法已经完全是汉语的读法和用法。它已经成为我们自己的汉语的字母，而不再是古拉丁文的字母，更不是英文、法文的字母。正确地说，它只能叫做汉语拼音字母，正如英文、法文、波兰文、捷克文的字母只能叫做英文字母、法文字母、波兰文字母、捷克文字母一样。用这套字母拼成的文字，写成的文章，也就是拼音的汉字和汉文。
    跟拉丁字母同样在国际间通用的还有斯拉夫字母。这两种字母都是从希腊字母演变而成，都可以作为拼写汉语的工具。我们采用拉丁字母而没有采用斯拉夫字母，那只是因为拉丁字母在我国有比较长久的历史传统，而且它的读音比较容易变通。苏联的学生也都学习拉丁字母，所以我们采用了拉丁字母，对于中苏两国间文化交流上并不发生困难。在另一方面，我们采用拉丁字母，对于我国和东南亚各国的文化交流，却增加了很大的便利。
    可能有人认为采用外来字母不合乎我国人民的爱国感情。这是误解。
    采用一种有利于我国经济和文化发展的字母，是完全符合于爱国主义的原则的。鲁迅先生和瞿秋白同志是我国的伟大的爱国主义者，他们都是汉字拉丁化的最热烈的倡导者，瞿秋白同志还是北方话拉丁化方案的最初的起草人。他们的参与汉字改革和拉丁化运动，正是热爱祖国、关怀民族利益的具体表现。
    字母跟火车、轮船、汽车、飞机等相类似，是没有阶级性的。谁利用它，它就为谁服务。现在世界各国所用的字母几乎都是外来的，不过在接受外来字母以后，各国都按照自己的需要作了加工罢了。例如英国、法国、德国、西班牙、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的字母都借用拉丁字母，拉丁字母和斯拉夫字母都源出于希腊字母，希腊字母来自腓尼基，腓尼基字母是在古埃及文字的影响下形成的，而埃及后来又采用源出腓尼基字母的阿拉伯字母。可是这并没有使有关各国的人民感觉到对于民族自尊心有什么妨碍。阿拉伯数字、加减乘除比例百分等符号、各种科学符号以至公历纪年和公制度量衡等等，都是全世界公用的，也都没有妨碍各国人民的民族自尊心。所以对于采用外来字母的顾虑是不必要的。
    4．为什么不用注音字母或者另外创造一套汉字笔画式的字母
    注音字母是1913年拟定，1918年公布的。近40年来，注音字母对于统一汉字读音有过不小的贡献。它的历史功绩是不可磨灭的。
    正如它的名称所表示，注音字母是给汉字注音的，在字典上或者语文课本上用来给汉字注音是适用的。可是，如果作为将来的汉语拼音文字的字母，那就不合适了。
    注音字母每个字母都像一个独立的汉字，因为这些符号本来是从古汉字来的。用来拼音，每个字母的这种独立性是个大缺点。尽管把几个字母拼到一块，在我们的视觉上它们仍然是分散的，不容易给人以浑然一体的感觉，不容易造成一个整体的词的印象。这个缺点，给个别汉字注音的时候还不显著，离开汉字拼写一句话或者整段文章的时候就很突出了。
      注音字母不便于草写和连写。一部分字母，例如：ㄑ（欺）和ㄥ（鞥）、ㄋ（讷）和ㄎ（科）、ㄊ（特）和ㄘ（雌）等，正体还可以辨别，草写的时候就容易混淆。注音字母的笔画曲折，不容易连写；勉强连写起来，就成为相当繁复的字形，阅读费力，容易弄错。
    注音字母的数目有37个之多。因为一部分字母代表着两个音素（例如ㄢ（安）＝an），不便于变化，所以字母虽多，却很不灵活。用它来拼写方言、少数民族的语言以及外来的人名、地名和科学名词，即使再增加一些符号，仍旧很不方便。
    我们希望有一套拼音字母，现在用来作为汉字注音和普通话拼音的工具，同时要能够适应科学和技术上的要求，将来还要能够逐步发展成为汉语的拼音文字。这样的希望，很难靠注音字母来实现。正因为如此，用拉丁字母来代替注音字母的企图，很早就有了。只要看注音字母拟订以后不久，又产生了国语罗马字，就可以了解。
    我们为什么不另外创造一套比注音字母更好的汉字笔画式的字母呢？
    创造一套汉字笔画式的字母并不难，可是要造得好，使大家满意，那就很难。
    新字母的图形，可能性可以无穷。哪一个图形好，哪一个不好，各人有各人的看法。一套新创的字母，要得到相当多数人的同意就不容易，要得到广大群众的一致同意，更加困难。字母是有习惯性的符号，没有历史基础的字母很难得到群众的拥护。
      汉字笔画式的字母，不容易适应现代文字的既能简明易认，又能一笔连写的要求。汉字草书能一笔连写，但是并不简明易认，因为草书并不是简单笔画的连写，而是整个汉字的连写。在打字、打电报、排印等等技术的利用上，现代文字还要求能把字母排成一列式的行列。勉强用汉字笔画式的字母这样排列连写，字体又失去了汉字笔画的风格，因此也就不能符合创造汉字笔画式字母的原意了。
    过去60年来有很多人创造过汉字笔画式的字母。注音字母是其中比较成熟的例子之一。解放以来，各地热心文字改革的同志们创造了好多套脱胎于汉字笔画的字母。从1952年到1954年，中国文字改革研究委员会集中群众的创造，拟订了几套汉字笔画式的字母。所有这些，从整个来看，都还不如国际通用的字母比较使人满意。经过五、六年的尝试和摸索，中国文字改革委员会得到领导上的同意，放弃了创造汉字笔画式字母的企图。当然，这一时期的尝试和摸索也不是白费的，因为如果不走过这一段路程，那末我们也许依然徘徊在十字路口，也就无从提出这个汉语拼音方案草案来。
    5．汉语拼音方案（草案）的拟订过程是怎样的
    1949年10月中国文字改革协会在北京成立，就着手进行汉语拼音方案的研究。1952年2月中国文字改革研究委员会成立以后，设立了拼音方案组，把拼音方案的研究作为主要工作之一。从1952年到1954年，主要地进行了汉字笔画式拼音方案的研究工作。1954年底，中国文字改革研究委员会改组成为中国文字改革委员会，1955年2月在会内设立了拼音方案委员会，对于拼音方案进行了更全面的有系统的研究。
    1955年10月，在全国文字改革会议上，拼音方案委员会提出四种汉字笔画式的方案草案，一种斯拉夫字母式的方案草案，一种拉丁字母式的方案草案，分发给到会代表，征求意见，请求批评。
      全国文字改革会议以后，中国文字改革委员会根据群众的意见，并得到领导上的同意，原则上决定采用拉丁字母式的拼音方案草案。1956年1月10日，中国文字改革委员会第四次全体会议讨论了拼音方案委员会提出的草案，在再作一次修正以后，全体一致通过。这就是现在发表出来提请各方讨论的汉语拼音方案草案。
    从1950年中国文字改革协会的时期起，到1955年8月31日为止，各地有633位热心文字改革的同志寄来了655个汉语拼音方案。这些方案来自全国各个省区，包括边远的省份和兄弟民族自治区；还有几个方案是从海外寄来的。拟订方案的同志包括各种不同的社会成分，有各级学校的教师和学生，有人民解放军和志愿军的指战员，有工厂、矿场、商店和机关的工作人员，有华侨。方案的内容也是各色各样的：有汉字笔画式的，有斯拉夫字母式的，有拉丁字母式的，还有其他特殊形式的。
    这些拼音方案，分开来作为各个独立的方案来看，不免是有缺点的，或者不够全面的；但是如果把它们作为一个整体来看，那么就是一份很宝贵的参考资料。汉语拼音化的各种可能性几乎都尝试过了。拼音方案委员会研究了这些材料，并且根据它们的内容进行了讨论。可以说，这655个方案的633位创制人，是跟中国文字改革委员会及其拼音方案委员会的工作人员在一起进行了工作的。他们虽然不是直接地、但是间接地参加了现在提出的这个汉语拼音方案草案的拟订工作。
    拟订这个汉语拼音方案草案，纵的方面，参考了300多年来的几十种主要的方案；横的方面，参考了解放以来全国各地同志们寄来的600多种草案；此外还参考了越南、朝鲜、日本等曾经用过汉字的国家对于文字改革的研究和经验。所以这次提出的汉语拼音方案草案实在是广大群众的集体创作，也是历史经验的初步总结。
  自然，这个草案一定还有不少缺点，我们把它发表出来，就是要征求各方面的批评和意见，好作为进一步修改的依据，因为我们深信，只有经过大家的讨论和批评，才能使它更加完善。
    6．拟订过程中有哪些重要的不同意见
    中国文字改革委员会及其拼音方案委员会，在长期讨论拼音方案的过程中，从原则问题到具体问题都有过许多不同意见，展开过热烈的辩论。可是每一个问题经过研究和辩论以后，最后都得到一致同意的解决。
    这里限于篇幅，只能把曾经经过辩论的几个重要的问题简单地报告一下：
    一、关于语音标准问题。有人主张以北京语音为标准，如实描写，北京人怎样说，就怎样拼写。有人主张以北京语音为基础，在这个基础上系统地区分“尖团音”（例如“新”写sin，“欣”写xin，不都写xin）。后来大家一致同意以北京语音为标准音，不有系统地区分尖团音。
    二、关于音节结构问题。有人主张采用双拼式，就是一个音节至多只用两个字母拼写，有人主张三拼式，有人主张“音素化”的拼写方式。后来一致同意采用“音素化”的拼写方式。
    三、关于声调问题。有人主张声调要全部标出，有人主张只在同音异调的词上标出。后来大家同意在正音教学的读物（例如字典、辞典等等）上声调全部标出，但是音译外来语和表声词等不标；其他书刊上可以不标声调的地方就不标。详细的办法以后再进一步规定。
      四、ㄓ（知）ㄔ（痴）ㄕ（诗）的写法问题。最初多数主张用zh、ch、sh，也曾有人提出用三个俄文字母，或者用其他的拉丁字母，同时也有人主张造三个新字母。在全国文字改革会议前夜，大家同意用zh、ch、sh作为正式写法，用加“腰带”的Z、C、S（即在Z、C、S三个字母中间加一短横）作为代用式。到1955年年底，经过讨论，改为用?、?、?作为正式字母，用zh、ch、sh作为代用式。
      五、“知痴诗日资雌思”等七个音节要不要写出母音的问题。多数主张写出这个母音，但是也有人不赞成写出。后来一致同意写出这个母音，但是不用独立的字母，只借用i的变体即小型的大写来表示。这个母音确实是存在的，因此必须有个字母来表示；但是这个母音难于独立发音，为了教学上的方便，不作为独立的字母列入字母表。
    六、ㄐ（基）ㄑ（欺）ㄒ（希）的写法问题。有人主张用ㄍ（哥）ㄎ（科）ㄏ（喝）兼表ㄐㄑㄒ（gi、ki、hi），有人主张用ㄓ（知）ㄔ（痴）ㄕ（诗）兼表ㄐㄑㄒ（?i、?i、?i），还有人主张用独立的三个字母来表示。最后决定用一个新字母ч（俄文字母）表示ㄐ，用q、x表示ㄑ、ㄒ。
    七、i（移）w（吴）要不要的问题。有人主张不要i和w，不论在音节开头和中间都用i（衣）和u（乌）。有人主张要有i、w和i、u的分别。后来一致同意要有i和w，因为如果不用i和w，就会有很多词的音节分隔不清，例如“主义”（?uii）和“赘”（?ui），“礼物”（liwu）和“溜”（liu），就会混淆了。如果都用隔音符号来分隔，符号用得太多，书写不便，也很难看。
    此外，还有很多次要的不同意见，经过讨论都作出了一致的决定，这里就略而不谈了。
