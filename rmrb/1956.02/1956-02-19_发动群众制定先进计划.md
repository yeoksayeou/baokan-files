Mobilize the Masses to Formulate Advanced Plans
Zhang Yong, Zhong Lu

The Party branch of the No. 1 workshop of the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant mobilized workers to repeatedly discuss the 1956 production plan, criticized conservative thinking, and formulated an advanced production plan.

1956 is the first year that the First Machine Tool Plant was fully put into production after its reconstruction. The 1A62 lathe is a type of machine tool very much needed in China's First Five-Year Plan. In 1956, the state required the plant's annual output of 1A62 lathes to be several times higher than the level reached when production began in 1955, but still much lower than the designed production capacity after the reconstruction. The No. 1 workshop is the processing workshop for the 1A62 lathe. Judging from the workshop's equipment capacity, number of workers, and technical proficiency, it is entirely possible to overfulfill the state plan.

After receiving the state plan, the leaders of the First Machine Tool Plant saw that it was several times higher than the actual level achieved in 1955. They also overly considered that the auxiliary departments might not be able to keep up, so they initially assigned tasks to the No. 1 workshop according to the state plan, without asking the No. 1 workshop to strive to overfulfill the state plan according to the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical."

Wang Wenshan, the director of the workshop, initially lacked confidence. After doing some research, he believed that there were conditions to overfulfill the plan, but there were also weak links. Therefore, he only proposed to overfulfill the state plan's annual output by 113.3%. Liu Dianwen, the acting Party branch secretary of the workshop, also considered this matter. He believed that completing 120% of the state plan was not a problem. The branch held two expanded meetings to discuss this issue. Initially, the head of the planning and scheduling group insisted that they could only complete 113.3%; the chief engineer, Chen Jinrong, also said that they could only reach 113.3%, and that more would be impossible.

The branch committee did not immediately make a decision. Instead, several branch committee members separately conducted in-depth investigations with activists from each work section. The results showed that some of the weak links mentioned by some cadres could be completely overcome. For example, some people emphasized that the slotting machine capacity was insufficient, but the workers said that although the slotting machine capacity was insufficient, the broaching machine was idle and the work of the slotting machine could be processed on the broaching machine. Other problems, such as the lack of drilling workers and grinding workers, could also be solved. At the second expanded meeting of the branch committee, a resolution to complete 120% of the state plan was passed. However, some chief engineers and work section leaders still did not fully agree. The branch considered that it would be difficult to lead the workers to set advanced plans if the cadres' understanding was not consistent. Therefore, after convening a mobilization meeting to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, another expanded meeting of the branch committee was held to thoroughly study the relevant instructions and documents on opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, and to further analyze the workshop's favorable and unfavorable factors. After everyone analyzed, they believed that there were many favorable factors: for example, the workshop had a complete set of design data, organizational design, and process regulations from the Soviet Union, as well as direct guidance from Soviet experts; many equipment potentials had not yet been exploited; piece-rate wages had been fully implemented, and workers were constantly breaking norms; and under the guidance of Soviet experts, workers' technical levels were gradually improving. If they could be well organized, many milling machines, grinding machines, drilling machines, etc., could be managed by multiple machines to solve the difficulty of insufficient workers. In particular, after the propaganda and education on opposing right-leaning conservatism and accelerating socialist construction and socialist transformation, the workers' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. There were also unfavorable factors: for example, some tools, fixtures, and materials were not supplied in a timely manner; after transitioning from small-batch production to mass production, although product quality improved month by month, the scrap rate was still not low; management personnel's work was not in-depth, and they rarely went to the workshop to help workers solve specific problems; some workers' labor discipline was lax... But these problems could be solved. For example, as long as various systems can be established and improved, the scope of responsibilities can be clarified, and political and ideological leadership can be strengthened, the sense of responsibility of some management personnel can be strengthened. In this way, everyone had a clear understanding, criticized conservative thinking, and determined to overfulfill the state plan by 123.3%.

The key to overcoming conservative thinking and formulating advanced plans lies in mobilizing the masses. After the expanded meeting of the branch committee, the branch also submitted the plan to the masses for discussion. The branch committee first convened a general meeting of Party members, passed a resolution, and called on all Party members to set an example in leading all employees to discuss the state plan and set personal and group guarantee plans. The branch decided to first conduct pilot discussions in two work sections: one was the shaft sleeve work section, which had a good record of completing tasks, and the other was the hexagon work section, which had a poor record of completing tasks. The discussion results were very good. The hexagon work section had always been considered a weak link because this work section had to make more than 80 kinds of parts of all sizes, the technology was complex, and turning, grinding, milling, and drilling were all required. If the coordination was not good, problems would occur. When the head of the work section, Gao Fengming, first received the target given by the workshop to complete 123.3% of the state plan, his heart skipped a beat and he immediately questioned it. However, when he consulted with the production team leaders and workers, especially after the workers discussed it, everything was unexpected. The workers said that they could not only complete it, but also complete 133.3%, and quickly put forward 26 rationalization proposals. The example of the hexagon work section setting an advanced plan promoted many work sections. Some people said: If the hexagon work section is to complete 133.3% of the state plan, then our assembly line can at least complete 140% of the state plan. Some individual workers have set personal plans to complete 170% to 200% of the state plan. Finally, the workshop, based on the results of the workers' discussions and after balancing, determined a relatively advanced plan to complete 130% of the state plan for the whole year. In the discussion process, the workers broke through the newly compressed quota of 28%, with the average exceeding the new quota by 26.5% in early January and 72.5% in mid-January. Shao Liansheng, a worker, shortened the working hours for grinding a large tool holder from the new quota of 50 minutes to 6 minutes due to the comprehensive use of tools and fixtures and familiarity with the process regulations. This unprecedentedly high socialist enthusiasm of the employees not only promoted the No. 1 workshop to formulate a relatively advanced plan, but also prompted the factory's leading cadres to accept the opinions of the masses and improve the planned target for the production of 1A62 lathes.

    发动群众制定先进计划
    张永　锺路
    沈阳第一机床厂一号车间党支部发动职工反复讨论了1956年的生产计划，批判了保守思想，制定了一个先进的生产计划。
    1956年是第一机床厂改建后全部投入生产的第一个年头。1A62车床是我国第一个五年计划中非常需要的一种机床。1956年国家要求这个厂1A62车床的年产量，高出1955年开始生产时所达到的水平的几倍，但比改建的设计生产能力还低得多。一号车间是1A62车床的加工车间，就这个车间的设备能力、工人数量和技术熟练程度来看，完全有可能超额完成国家计划。
    第一机床厂领导上接到国家计划后，看到比1955年实际达到的水平高数倍，同时又过多地考虑辅助部门跟不上，所以开始时就按国家计划给一号车间下达任务，而没有要求一号车间根据又多、又快、又好、又省的原则，争取超额地完成国家计划。
    车间主任王文山最初心里也没底，后来做了一些研究，认为有条件超额完成，但也有薄弱环节，所以只提出超额完成国家计划年产量的113.3％。车间代理党支部书记刘殿文也考虑了这件事，他认为完成国家计划的120％没问题。支部曾两次召开扩大会议，讨论这个问题。开始，计划调度组组长坚持只能完成113.3％；总工长陈金荣也说只能达到113.3％，多一点也完不成。
    支部委员会没有马上作决定，而是由几个支部委员分头找各工段的积极分子进行深入了解，结果发现有些干部所说的薄弱环节是完全可以克服的。比如有人强调插床能力不够，而工人说，插床能力虽然不足，但拉床有闲着的，可以把插床的活拿到拉床上加工。其他如缺钻工、磨工等问题也都可以解决。在第二次召开的支部委员扩大会议上，便通过了完成国家计划120％的决议。但有的总工长、工段长仍然没有完全同意。支部考虑到干部认识不一致，就很难领导工人定出先进计划，所以在召开动员提前完成五年计划大会之后，又召开了支部委员扩大会议，深入学习了有关反对右倾保守思想的指示和文件，进一步分析了车间究竟有哪些有利因素和不利因素。大家一分析，认为有利因素很多：比如车间里有苏联的全套设计资料、组织设计和工艺规程，苏联专家的直接指导；许多设备潜力还没有发挥出来；计件工资已全面推行，工人正在不断地突破定额；同时在苏联专家指导下，工人的技术水平正逐渐提高，如果能够很好地加以组织，许多铣床、磨床、钻床等都可实行多机床看管，以解决工人不足的困难。特别是职工们经过反对右倾保守、加速社会主义建设和社会主义改造的宣传教育，生产热情空前高涨。不利因素也是有的：比如，有些工卡具和材料供应不及时；从小批生产过渡到大量生产后，虽然产品质量逐月提高，但废品率依然不低；管理人员工作不深入，很少下车间帮助工人具体解决问题；部分工人劳动纪律松懈……。但这些问题都是可以解决的。比如，只要能够建立和健全各项制度，明确职责范围，加强政治思想领导，某些管理人员的责任心是可以加强的。这样一来，大家心里有了数，批判了保守思想，确定超额完成国家计划123.3％。
    克服保守思想，制定先进计划的关键在于发动群众。在支部委员扩大会后，支部又把计划交给群众讨论。支部委员会首先召开了党员大会，通过决议，号召全体党员以身作则带动全体职工讨论好国家计划，订好个人和小组保证计划。支部确定先在两个工段试点讨论：一个是完成任务好的轴套工段；一个是完成任务差的六角工段。讨论结果很好。六角工段过去一直被人们认为是薄弱环节，因为这个工段要做大大小小80多种部件，技术复杂，车、磨、铣、钻样样俱全，稍一配合不好，就会发生问题。工段长高凤明开始接到车间给的完成国家计划123.3％的指标的时候，心里一跳，直划问号。可是当他找生产小组长和工人研究，特别是经过工人讨论后，一切都出乎意料，工人说不但能完成，而且还能完成133.3％，很快就提出合理化建议26件。六角工段定出先进计划的事例，推动了许多工段。有人说：六角工段都要完成国家计划的133.3％，咱们流水线至少也可以完成国家计划的140％。还有个别工人订出个人计划要完成国家计划的170％到200％。最后车间根据工人讨论结果，加以平衡，确定了全年完成国家计划130％的比较先进的计划。在讨论过程中，工人纷纷突破最近刚压缩了28％的新定额，1月上旬平均超过新定额26.5％，中旬超过72.5％。工人邵连生由于全面使用了工卡具，熟悉了工艺规程，磨一个大刀架的工时由新定额50分钟缩短为6分钟。职工群众这种空前高涨的社会主义积极性，不但推动了一号车间制定了比较先进的计划，而且也推动了厂的领导干部接受了群众的意见，提高了生产1A62车床的计划指标。
