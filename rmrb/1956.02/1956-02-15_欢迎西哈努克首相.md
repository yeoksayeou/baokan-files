Welcoming Prime Minister Sihanouk
    Our Correspondent

    Under the blue sky and white clouds, two bright flags flutter in the spring breeze. One is the national flag of the People's Republic of China, and the other is the national flag of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

    Beijing is waiting for our country's guest—Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The western suburban airport presents a scene of peace and festivity. Ministers and generals of the People's Republic of China are wearing brand-new ceremonial uniforms, and the girls are dressed more beautifully than the flowers they hold in their hands. The welcoming crowd packs the inside and outside of the airport tightly, but on the several highways leading directly to the airport, cars are lined up and still arriving continuously.

    Premier Zhou Enlai is waiting with everyone for his friend Prince Sihanouk. They had friendly contact at the Asian-African Conference last year.

    At exactly three o'clock, the roar of engines comes from far to near. The silver plane carrying Prince Sihanouk lands smoothly on the runway.

    Prince Sihanouk appears at the cabin door with a smile on his face. The breeze gently blows his black cloak. He is wearing a tight-fitting national costume. The crowd cheers for him. He waves to the cheering people.

    Premier Zhou Enlai stepped forward and shook hands firmly with Prince Sihanouk. He greeted the guest and said enthusiastically, "We welcome you!" Prince Sihanouk said, "I am very happy to see you again. Thank you for your invitation."

    The cheering crowd watched the mutual greetings of the two statesmen with joy. People feel intimately that the awakened Asia is uniting more and more closely. Beijing is the witness. It is at this airport that people have welcomed the outstanding Indian statesman Prime Minister Nehru, the leader of the Vietnamese people President Ho Chi Minh, the Prime Minister of Burma U Nu, and the former Prime Minister of Indonesia Sastroamidjojo. The Chinese people believe that Prince Sihanouk's visit to our country is the beginning of a new stage in the friendly relations between China and Cambodia. The era when Asia was divided and isolated is gone forever.

    The band played the national anthems of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the People's Republic of China. Premier Zhou accompanied Prince Sihanouk to review the honor guard.

    The politicians of the Kingdom of Cambodia shook hands and met with the ministers of our government and the heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations one by one. Prince Sihanouk was very happy to see again those Chinese friends he had met at the Asian-African Conference. "We met in Bandung!" they greeted each other affectionately.

    The diplomatic envoys to our country also came to the airport. Indian Ambassador R.K. Nehru and Polish Ambassador Kirylok shook hands warmly with Sihanouk, their countries having made many valuable efforts to implement the Geneva Accords and maintain peace in Cambodia and Indochina. Sihanouk also shook hands with Hoang Van Hoan, Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, for a long time, symbolizing the peaceful friendship between the Vietnamese and Cambodian people.

    Prince Sihanouk walked to the microphone. This young statesman, after the Asian-African Conference, has repeatedly stated that his government agrees with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and is determined to pursue a neutral policy. Now, he expressed his friendship to China. He said that his visit was to establish friendly relations with Cambodia's oldest friend—China. People responded to his friendly speech with long-lasting applause.

    Then, Premier Zhou and Prince Sihanouk walked shoulder to shoulder to the ranks of the welcoming crowd. Shouts of "Long live the friendship between China and Cambodia!" and "Long live peace!" rose one after another in the crowd. Countless colorful flags, flowers, and garlands waved in the crowd. Colorful confetti fell like snowflakes on the prince and the premier. Lamas in maroon robes and monks in yellow cassocks greeted the guests with their palms together. Prince Sihanouk, who believes in Buddhism, also returned the salute with his palms together. Young men and women were dancing and shouting. In the long line of welcomers, lively and beautiful girls kept running out, offering flowers to the prince. Prince Sihanouk shook hands with them excitedly, accepting the warmth and friendship of the Chinese people towards the Cambodian people who have embarked on the road of independent development.

    Beijing warmly and grandly welcomed Prince Sihanouk. Our neighbors and friends have thus begun their visit to New China. (Attached pictures)

    欢迎西哈努克首相
    本报记者
    蓝天白云底下，两面鲜艳的旗帜舒卷着春风。一面是中华人民共和国的国旗，一面是柬埔寨王国的国旗。
    北京在等候着我们国家的客人——柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王。西郊机场呈现着一派和平和节日的气象。中华人民共和国的部长们和将军们穿着崭新的礼服，姑娘们装扮得比她们手里捧着的鲜花还要艳丽。欢迎的人群把机场内外挤得密密层层，但是，在直通机场的几条公路上，汽车排成直线，还在不断驶来。
    周恩来总理和大家一起在等待他的朋友西哈努克亲王。去年他们曾经在亚非会议有过友好的接触。
    三时正，轰鸣的马达声自远而近。载着西哈努克亲王的银色飞机，平稳地在跑道着陆。
    西哈努克亲王笑容满面地出现在机舱门口。微风把他黑色的披风轻轻吹起。他穿着紧身的民族礼服。群众向他欢呼。他向欢呼的人们招手致意。
    周恩来总理走上前去，同西哈努克亲王紧紧地握手。他向客人问候，并且热情地说：“我们欢迎您！”西哈努克亲王说：“能够再一次见到您，非常高兴。感谢您的邀请。”
    欢呼的人群怀着喜悦的心情，注视着两位政治家的相互问候。人们亲切地感觉到，觉醒了的亚洲正在日益紧密地团结起来。北京就是见证。就是在这个机场上，人们欢迎过印度杰出的政治家尼赫鲁总理，欢迎过越南人民的领袖胡志明主席，欢迎过缅甸的吴努总理和印度尼西亚前总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约。中国人民相信，西哈努克亲王的访问我国，是中柬两国友好关系进入新阶段的开始。亚洲被分裂和隔绝的年代已经一去不复返了。
    乐队奏起柬埔寨王国和中华人民共和国的国歌。周总理陪同西哈努克亲王一起检阅仪仗队。
    柬埔寨王国的政治家们同我国政府的各部部长，以及各民主党派和人民团体的负责人，一一握手见面。西哈努克亲王非常高兴再次见到那些在亚非会议会晤过的中国朋友们。“在万隆见过！”他们这样地亲切招呼。
    驻我国的各外交使节也来到了机场。印度大使拉·库·尼赫鲁和波兰大使基里洛克和西哈努克热情地握手，他们的国家为了贯彻日内瓦协议、维护柬埔寨和印度支那的和平做过许多珍贵的努力。西哈努克并和越南民主共和国大使黄文欢长久地握手，象征着越南人民和柬埔寨人民的和平友谊。
    西哈努克亲王走到扩音机前。这位年青的政治家，在亚非会议以后，曾经一再表示，他的政府赞同和平共处的五项原则，决心奉行中立政策。现在，他向中国表示自己的友谊。他说，他这次访问，是为了同柬埔寨最老的朋友——中国建立友好关系。人们用经久不息的掌声来回答他的友好讲话。
    接着，周总理和西哈努克亲王肩并肩地走向欢迎群众的行列。人群中此起彼伏地发出“中柬两国友好万岁！”“和平万岁！”的口号声。数不尽的彩旗、鲜花和花环在人丛中摇动。五彩缤纷的纸片像雪花一样洒落在亲王和总理的身上。披着酱红色袈裟的喇嘛和黄色戒衣的和尚，向客人合掌致敬。信奉佛教的西哈努克亲王也合掌答谢。青年男女们跳着、喊着。长长的欢迎者的行列里，不断地跑出活泼美丽的姑娘，把鲜花献给亲王。西哈努克亲王激动地同她们握手，接受中国人民对走上了独立自主发展道路的柬埔寨人民的热情和友谊。
    北京热烈地、隆重地欢迎了西哈努克亲王。我们邻人和朋友，就这样开始了他们在新中国的访问。（附图片）
