Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: Li Wei, a naval officer of the Chiang Kai-shek group who defected and returned to the motherland from training in the United States, returned to his hometown of Wuxi City from Beijing on the afternoon of the 11th to reunite with his family and celebrate the Spring Festival.

    Li Wei's parents received a letter from Li Wei a few days ago saying he would return home to celebrate the Spring Festival. They prepared more wine and food than in previous years, waiting for their son, who had been away from home for nine years, to come back and celebrate the Spring Festival together. On Lunar New Year's Eve, the whole family ate a reunion dinner.

    Li Wei told reporters: "This time I went home, from Beijing to Wuxi, what I saw and heard along the way gave me a very profound education and great encouragement. I am determined to contribute my strength to the socialist construction of the motherland."

    Xinhua News Agency, Changshan, 12th: Yang Jiying, a naval officer of the Chiang Kai-shek group who recently defected and returned to the mainland of the motherland, returned to his hometown—Duanjia Village, Changshan County, Shandong Province (formerly under the jurisdiction of Zouping County) during the Spring Festival to reunite with his family. Yang Jiying spent the Spring Festival happily with his father, mother, younger brother, and younger sister.

    Yang Jiying's family has joined the agricultural production cooperative. On Lunar New Year's Eve, Yang Jiying's whole family sat around the warm stove, drinking tea and excitedly talking about the good life after liberation. On the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year, his house was crowded with male and female neighbors in new clothes who came to see him, including his childhood classmates and friends.
