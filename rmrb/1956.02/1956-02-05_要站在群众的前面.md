    It is necessary to stand in front of the masses
    By Our Correspondent Sun Zunian
    In the past few months, the broad masses of peasants organized in Jiangxi Province have set off a high tide of agricultural production increase. Agricultural cooperatives have added farm tools, purchased livestock, built water conservancy projects, carried out winter plowing and manure accumulation, and the masses' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high.
    The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to strive to complete the five-year agricultural production plan targets in four years. It requires that the grain output in 1956 be increased to 14.32 billion jin on the basis of the 12.3 billion jin output in 1955, that is, an increase of 2.02 billion jin of grain, which is 1.32 billion jin more than the original planned output. Party organizations at all levels responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and promptly formulated grain production increase plans for special districts, counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives.
    When formulating the 1956 production increase plan, a considerable number of county and district cadres had insufficient understanding of the production upsurge brought about by the high tide of agricultural cooperation, and therefore were not confident in "striving to complete the five-year agricultural production plan targets in four years." They believed that their region had little potential and poor conditions, and it was impossible to increase production; some believed that Jiangxi suffered from water, drought, insects, and other disasters every year, and there was no guarantee of increased production. In Sanyang District, Yichun County, 10% of farmers joined cooperatives in the spring of 1955, and production increased by 10%; now the number of farmers joining cooperatives and the amount of land joining cooperatives have reached 80%, but the production increase plan set by this district for 1956 is still 10%. In some districts of Suichuan County, the original production increase target for 1956 was only about 6%.
    Is it really impossible to achieve the five-year agricultural production increase plan targets in four years, as those with conservative ideas say? The analysis made by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the provincial committee enlarged meeting attended by the secretaries of the prefectural and county committees in December 1955 answered this question. The rice planting area in Jiangxi Province is more than 41 million mu, of which early rice is more than 16.11 million mu, middle rice is 9.27 million mu, and late rice is more than 15.67 million mu. The two-season late rice only has 6.2 million mu, accounting for only 15.1% of the rice planting area. Judging from the above-mentioned early, middle, and late rice planting areas, there are still more than 20 million mu of single-season rice in the province (most of which can be turned into double-season rice). The yield per unit area of ​​farmland in the province varies greatly. The yield of some counties reaches more than seven or eight hundred jin per mu, while some counties are less than 200 jin. Calculated by the cultivated area, the average rice yield per mu in the province is only 320 jin, and calculated by the planting area, the average per mu is less than 280 jin. This shows that the yield per unit area and the land utilization rate in the province are very low, and the potential for increasing production is great. Now the province has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperation. Based on these favorable conditions, the Provincial Party Committee requires that in 1956, the province will convert 2 million mu of single-season rice into double-season rice, with an average increase of 250 jin per mu; after the harvest of one season of early and middle rice, use the autumn idle land to expand the autumn grain dry crops by 5 million mu, with an average increase of 60 jin per mu, and increase the yield per unit area by 6%. In addition to measures such as reclaiming 750,000 mu of wasteland and turning 150,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields, it is indeed possible to increase grain production by 2 billion to 2.1 billion jin in the province in 1956. The original plan of Yongxin County was to increase grain production by 18% by 1957 compared with 1955. This time, the county party committee mobilized agricultural cooperatives throughout the county to discuss the provincial party committee's instructions on increasing production, and revised the production increase plan from the bottom up. Judging from the three agricultural production increase measures, wasteland reclamation, and intensive cultivation, the production can be increased by 22% in 1956 alone. Yichun County's Sanyang District originally planned to increase production by 10% in 1956. Now it is re-finding tricks and tapping potential. The district has a cultivated area of 52,599 mu, of which 23,287 mu are double-season rice and 29,312 mu are single-season rice. Coupled with 20,000 mu of intercropping converted into continuous cropping and 100 mu of wasteland reclamation, the production can be increased by 40.7% in 1956. The first agricultural cooperative of Lucun Township in this district converted 14.4 mu of intercropping into continuous cropping in 1955, with an average increase of 450 jin per mu, and the total output of the cooperative increased by 23%. In 1956, the planned area for intercropping to continuous cropping was expanded to 710 mu, and it is estimated that the production can be increased by 56.6%. Most counties, districts, and cooperatives in the province can achieve the task of completing the five-year agricultural production increase target in four years after such in-depth and meticulous finding of tricks and tapping of potential. Those who cannot see the great potential for agricultural production increase under the great development of cooperatives should now be sober. They should go deep into the masses and lead the masses forward; otherwise, they will fall behind the masses!

    要站在群众的前面
    本报记者　孙祖年
    几个月来，江西省组织起来的广大农民，掀起了农业增产的高潮。各个农业合作社，纷纷添置农具，购买牲畜，兴修水利，冬耕积肥，群众的生产情绪空前高涨。
    中共江西省委决定：五年农业生产计划指标，争取四年完成。要求粮食产量1956年在1955年123亿斤产量的基础上，增加到143.2亿斤，即增产粮食20.2亿斤，比原定计划产量增加13.2亿斤。各级党组织纷纷响应省委的号召，及时制定专区、县、区、乡、社的粮食增产计划。
    在制定1956年增产计划的时候，还有相当一部分县、区干部，对于农业合作化高潮带来的生产高潮认识不足，因而对于“五年农业增产计划指标争取四年完成”信心不高。他们认为自己的地区潜力小，条件差，不可能增产；有的认为江西年年都有水、旱、虫等灾害，增产没有保证。宜春县三阳区，1955年春入社农户10％，增产10％；现在入社农户和入社土地都达到了80％，但是这个区定的1956年增产计划仍然是10％。遂川县有的区原定1956年增产指标只有6％左右。
    争取四年达到五年农业增产计划的指标，是不是像那些有保守思想的人说的那样没有把握呢？中共江西省委在1955年12月召开的有地、县委书记参加的省委扩大会议上的分析，回答了这个问题。江西全省水稻播种面积是4，100多万亩，其中早稻1，611万多亩，中稻927万亩，晚稻1，567万亩。晚稻中二季晚稻仅有620万亩，只占水稻播种面积15.1％。从上述早、中、晚稻播种面积来看，全省还有2，000多万亩是单季稻（其中绝大部分可变为双季稻）。全省农田的单位面积产量差别很大，有的县产量每亩达到七、八百斤以上，有的县还不到200斤。全省水稻产量以耕地面积计算，每亩平均只有320斤，若以播种面积计算，平均每亩不到280斤。这就说明了全省单位面积产量和土地利用率很低，增产潜力很大。现在全省已经基本上实现半社会主义农业合作化。根据这些有利条件，省委要求1956年全省变单季稻为双季稻200万亩，每亩平均增产250斤；在一季早、中稻收割后，利用秋闲田，扩大秋季粮食旱作物500万亩，每亩增产60斤，提高单位面积产量6％。加上开荒75万亩、旱地变水田15万亩等措施，全省1956年增产粮食20亿到21亿斤是确实可以办到的。永新县原计划到1957年粮食产量比1955年增加18％。这次县委发动全县农业合作社讨论省委增产指示，自下而上地修订了增产计划，仅就农业增产三项措施、开荒、精耕细作等几方面计算，1956年就能增产22％。宜春县三阳区原定1956年增产10％，现在重新找窍门，挖潜力，全区耕地面积52，599亩，其中双季稻23，287亩，单季稻29，312亩，加上间作改连作2万亩、开荒100亩，1956年可增产40.7％。这个区的泸村乡第一农业合作社，1955年间作改连作14.4亩，平均每亩增产450斤，全社增产23％。1956年计划间作改连作的面积扩大到710亩，预计可以增产56.6％。全省绝大部分县、区、合作社经过这样深入细致地找窍门、挖潜力，都能实现四年完成五年农业增产指标的任务。那些看不到合作社大发展下的农业增产的巨大潜力的人，现在应该清醒了。他们应该深入群众，领导群众前进；不然就要落在群众的后面了！
