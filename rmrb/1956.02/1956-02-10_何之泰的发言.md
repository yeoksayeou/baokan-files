Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

We are holding this meeting at a time when the socialist transformation of our country's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce is developing rapidly, and when "the upsurge of agricultural cooperation throughout the country is causing an upsurge in agricultural production throughout the country, and in turn, promoting a new upsurge in the entire national economy and scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings." I attend this meeting with incomparable joy. I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the several reports made by Chairman Zhou Enlai and other leaders at the conference.

I am a water conservancy worker, please allow me to express some opinions from the perspective of water conservancy. If there is anything incorrect, please criticize and correct me. My discussion will be divided into (1) my understanding of the "National Agricultural Development Program" and (2) my thoughts on water conservancy work.

(1) My understanding of the "National Agricultural Development Program":

After reading the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I felt infinite joy and encouragement. Although this program is mainly aimed at 500 million farmers, giving them a long-term goal for agricultural development, it is equally important for workers, intellectuals, and people of other strata. Because the undertakings of various sectors of the national economy are interconnected and must cooperate with each other, and proceed according to the principle of planned and proportionate development of the socialist national economy, in order to meet the requirements of our country's general line. I sincerely support this program and resolutely join the people of the whole country in striving for its thorough realization.

Article 10 of the National Agricultural Development Program, regarding the specific arrangements and requirements for "building water conservancy projects and maintaining soil and water," which is the most important measure for increasing agricultural production, I think is very appropriate. Only the combination of small-scale water conservancy projects, small river management, various soil and water conservation works, and the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects, combined with the management of large and medium-sized rivers, can completely and thoroughly eliminate waterlogging and drought disasters. Only when local agricultural production cooperatives and state organs divide responsibilities and cooperate with each other can the socialist construction and socialist transformation undertakings of our country be successfully promoted and the overall national task be fully completed. In the six years since liberation, under the leadership and encouragement of the Party and the People's Government, farmers in various regions have already built many small-scale water conservancy projects, such as digging wells, opening canals, excavating ponds, building dikes, and constructing dams. In doing this work, they have created many advanced methods and gained a lot of advanced experience. After collectivization, the farmers have even greater enthusiasm for production. By summarizing and promoting the existing advanced experience, they will surely be able to easily and happily take on this task and carry it out in a planned and large-scale manner. Combined with the national large-scale water conservancy projects, it is not a problem to basically eliminate ordinary floods and droughts within 7 to 12 years.

(2) My thoughts on water conservancy work:

During the period of reactionary rule, waterlogging and drought disasters occurred frequently in various parts of our country. The Yellow River was said to be a river that was harmful and unprofitable. The Huai River suffered major disasters in heavy rains and minor disasters in light rains, and droughts when there was no rain. The Han River's lower reaches suffered from floods two out of every three years. People said: "Shahu Mianyang Prefecture, nine years out of ten are bad harvests." In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, from 1921 to 1949, there were as many as five very serious floods. The 1931 Yangtze River flood submerged more than 7.6 million hectares of cultivated land, affecting more than 2.5 million farming households. All cities along the Yangtze River from Shashi to Shanghai were submerged, and the people's property losses amounted to 1.2 billion silver dollars. The reactionary ruling class and those corrupt officials only knew how to ride on the heads of the people and carry out cruel exploitation. When they encountered years of waterlogging and drought disasters, they not only did not provide relief to the victims, but instead took the opportunity to swindle and amass wealth. As a result, the dikes were repaired worse and worse, and the disaster situation became more and more serious. Speaking of it, it's truly hateful!

After liberation, the situation completely changed. The Communist Party of China and the People's Government, for the benefit of the broad masses of the people, mobilized and organized the vast working people, and dispatched a large number of the People's Liberation Army to work with them to fight against nature, and launched large-scale flood prevention, drainage, and drought prevention measures. In recent years, they have achieved great results. As everyone knows: the dikes of major and medium-sized rivers across the country have been generally reinforced and consolidated; the Jingjiang Flood Diversion, the diversion of the Yellow River to aid the Wei River, the Foziling Reservoir, the Guanting Reservoir and many other great projects have been successfully completed, and have played a great role in reducing waterlogging and drought disasters. For example, in 1954, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River experienced a great flood that had not been seen in a century, which, in terms of the highest flood level in Hankou, was more than one and a half meters higher than the 1931 flood. But we still overcame it. The Jingjiang Dike, protecting the Jingbei Plain, remained safe and sound. Important cities such as Wuhan, Huangshi, and Nanjing remained safe and sound. This is a miracle. This can only be produced in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. In addition, the lower reaches of the Han River flood diversion, the Meishan Reservoir, the Dahuo房 Reservoir and other projects are currently under construction, and some of them can be completed before the flood season this year. Even more magnificent is that the comprehensive utilization basin plan of the Yellow River has been completed and approved by the Second National People's Congress, and will be gradually implemented. Among them, the two major reservoir projects, Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia, have now begun to be designed; large-scale soil and water conservation work has also begun. In a few years, this yellow river, which has always been said to be harmful and unprofitable, will be transformed into a clear river that is beneficial and harmless.

Following the comprehensive utilization basin plan of the Yellow River, the comprehensive utilization basin planning of many other rivers is also underway. Among them, the comprehensive utilization basin plan of the Han River will be completed soon. As the first phase of the Han River development project, the design of the Danjiangkou Reservoir project was requested by the recent National Water Conservancy Conference to be submitted within 1957. The Han River is a large tributary of the Yangtze River, and its maximum peak flood flow reaches 40,000 cubic meters per second in the Xiangyang and Nianpanshan area, which is much larger than the maximum peak flood flow of the Yellow River and the Huai River. If the normal high water level of the Danjiangkou Reservoir is set at 180 meters, the total reservoir capacity is 38.5 billion cubic meters, and the effective reservoir capacity is 34 billion cubic meters. After the project is completed, in terms of flood control, the once-in-a-thousand-year flood above Danjiangkou can be regulated, so that the peak flood below Nianpanshan does not exceed the safe shallow flow of 12,000 cubic meters per second in the downstream. When a once-in-a-thousand-year flood occurs in the area below Danjiangkou, it can also be solved by cooperating with the Zekou temporary flood diversion. In terms of irrigation, it can provide conditions for irrigating 12 million mu in the Tangbai River basin and diverting the Han River to aid the Yellow River and the Huai River. In terms of electricity, the installed capacity is 600,000-800,000 kilowatts, and the average annual power generation is 3-4 billion kilowatt-hours. In terms of navigation, the flow rate is regulated to 550 cubic meters per second, so that ships with a draft of 1.5 meters can navigate downstream all year round.

The Yangtze River is the largest river in our country. Its basin area is 1.8 million square kilometers, accounting for about one-fifth of the country's total area. There are 230 million people in the basin, accounting for about two-fifths of the country's total population and one-tenth of the world's total population. The climate is mild, the rainfall is abundant, the soil is fertile, and the resources are abundant. The annual runoff of the Yangtze River is 50% larger than that of the Mississippi River in the United States, twice as large as that of the Yenisei River, the largest river in the Soviet Union, three times as large as that of the Volga River, and twenty-five times as large as that of the Yellow River. The development of the water conservancy resources of the Yangtze River is extremely important for the development of various sectors of the national economy such as industry, agriculture, and transportation in our country. The comprehensive utilization basin planning work of such a large Yangtze River has never been done in the world, and this work is now being carried out under the direct guidance of Soviet experts. The main points of the Yangtze River basin plan can be submitted before the end of this year. The original plan was to submit the comprehensive utilization basin planning report of the Yangtze River in 1958. Now, in order to meet the needs of the new situation of the great development of the national socialist transformation undertaking, it is required to be completed one year in advance, and it is hoped that a large reservoir will be built on the main stream of the Yangtze River within 10 to 12 years. If this large reservoir is built in the Three Gorges, and the normal high water level is calculated at 235 meters, the total reservoir capacity will be 137 billion cubic meters, and the effective reservoir capacity will be 105 billion cubic meters. The engineering benefits after completion: in terms of flood control, the peak flood flow of once-in-a-thousand-year flood in Yichang can be reduced from 96,500 cubic meters per second to 30,000 cubic meters per second. Combined with the Han River, Yuan River and other tributary reservoirs, small water conservancy, soil and water conservation work, etc., the floods of the Yangtze River will disappear forever. In terms of electricity, the average annual power generation is about 155 billion kilowatt-hours. Providing conditions for the electrification of vast areas of our country, in terms of navigation, regulating the downstream flow rate of 11,700-13,200 cubic meters per second (guarantee rate of 95%-50%), so that 10,000-ton seagoing vessels can sail directly to Chongqing or Luzhou. In terms of farmland water conservancy, because of cheap electricity through pumping irrigation and water absorption and drainage, hills and highlands and lakes and lowlands can be turned into fertile fields, which can greatly increase the area of cultivated land in our country.

The above situations fully show that in terms of water conservancy, we are doing extremely glorious and great undertakings that our predecessors have never done before.

In the old society, due to political corruption, the social atmosphere was very bad, corruption and degeneration were commonplace, and taking by force and plunder was considered a skill, and refusing to go along with it was considered foolish. Many old water conservancy engineers had fantasies of building water conservancy projects, eliminating water disasters, and making contributions to the people, but they worked hard all their lives and ultimately achieved nothing. After the founding of the new China, water conservancy workers stood up together with the people of the whole country. In the past 6 years, under the leadership and education of the Communist Party of China, through a series of great movements, engineering practices, and continuous hard study, our water conservancy workers have made certain progress in ideological understanding, political awareness, and professional level, contributed a lot of strength to the national water conservancy construction cause, and achieved certain results. However, these advances are far behind the needs of the development of the objective situation, and we must catch up quickly; we also have many shortcomings and errors in our work, which must be quickly corrected and completely eliminated.

1. Strengthen theoretical study and overcome conservative ideas: Many of our water conservancy technical work comrades, including myself, have a common feeling: the reason why certain work has not been done well, detours have been taken, or tasks cannot be completed as scheduled is not because of insufficient technical level, but because of incorrect thinking methods and working methods, affected by subjectivism or right-leaning conservative ideas, and not proceeding from reality and considering problems comprehensively. We must overcome these shortcomings so that in future work, we can achieve the requirements of "more, faster, better, and more economical." We must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and improve the level of political thought.

2. Implement expert advice and learn from advanced experience: In the past, we did not pay enough attention to learning and promoting advanced experience at home and abroad and the suggestions of Soviet experts. This is a big shortcoming. In order to improve our scientific and technological level, and in order to make our scientific and technological level catch up with the advanced level of world science and technology as quickly as possible, this shortcoming must not be allowed to continue. We must immediately correct this shortcoming and establish a system to ensure its implementation.

3. Strengthen contact work and oppose departmentalism: Water conservancy work is closely related to various sectors of the national economy. The preparation of a river basin plan or the design of a water conservancy hub must be coordinated with relevant national economic departments. In the past, due to insufficient understanding of this point and insufficient attention, work was often passive and chaotic, and the country suffered losses. This contact work has not been done well, sometimes because departmentalism is at work. Because our country's water conservancy undertaking, as mentioned above, is also developing rapidly, we must learn from past lessons, oppose departmentalism, do a good job in contact work, promote the spirit of collectivism, support each other, work together, and strive for the successful advancement of our country's great socialist water conservancy construction undertaking.

Finally, I would like to make a guarantee to everyone: I will definitely be honest, diligent, and assiduous, study hard, work hard, demand myself according to the standards of a Communist Party member, and contribute my greatest strength to our country's great socialist construction and socialist transformation undertaking.

    何之泰的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们这次会议是在我国的农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造正在飞速地向前发展和“全国农业合作化的高潮正在引起全国农业生产的高潮，并转而促进整个国民经济和科学、文化、教育、卫生事业的新的高潮”的情况下召开的。我以无比喜悦的心情出席了这次会议。我对周恩来主席和其他各位首长在大会上所作的几个报告完全同意，并衷心拥护。
    我是一个水利工作者，请允许我就从水利这方面发表一点意见。有不对的地方，请批评指正。我要谈的内容，分为（1）我对“全国农业发展纲要”的体会和（2）我对水利工作的感想。
    （1）我对“全国农业发展纲要”的体会：
    我读了中共中央政治局的“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”，感到无限的欢欣和鼓舞。这个纲要虽然主要是对5亿农民提出的，使他们对于农业的发展有一个长期奋斗的目标，但对工人、知识分子和其他各阶层的人民来说，同样是很重要的。因为国民经济各部门的事业是互相联系着的，必须彼此互相配合，按社会主义国民经济有计划按比例发展的原则来进行，才能符合我们国家总路线的要求。我竭诚地拥护这个纲要，并坚决地和全国人民一道为它的彻底实现而奋斗。
    全国农业发展纲要第十条，关于“兴修水利，保持水土”这一项最主要的农业增产措施的具体安排和要求，我认为是很恰当的。只有小型水利工程、小河的治理、各种水土保持工作与大型水利工程的建设，与大、中河流的治理相结合，才能全面地、彻底地消灭水旱灾害。只有地方农业生产合作社与国家机关分工负责，互相配合，才能使我国社会主义建设与社会主义改造事业胜利推进，全面完成国家总任务。解放后6年来，各地农民在党和人民政府的领导和鼓励下，已经办过不少小型水利工程，例如打井、开渠、挖塘、修堤、筑坝等等。他们在做这些工作中，曾创造了许多先进的办法，取得了不少的先进经验。合作化之后，农民的生产劲头更大了，把已有的先进经验加以总结和推广，他们一定能够轻松愉快地把这个任务担当起来，有计划地大量地去办理。结合国家大型水利工程，要求在7年至12年内基本上消灭普通的水灾和旱灾，是没有问题的。
    （2）我对水利工作的感想：
    在反动统治时期，我国各地经常发生水旱灾害。黄河被人们说成是有害无利的河流。淮河则大雨大灾，小雨小灾，无雨旱灾。汉水下游的水灾三年两遇，人们说：“沙湖沔阳州，十年九不收”。长江中下游从1921年到1949年当中，发生过很严重的水灾达5次之多。长江1931年的水灾，淹没耕地760多万公顷，受灾农民250多万户，从沙市到上海沿江所有城市全被淹没，人民财产的损失达12亿银元之多。反动统治阶级和那些贪官污吏，只知骑在人民头上，进行残苛剥削，遇到发生水旱灾害的年头，他们不但不救济灾民，反而要乘机诈取一番，大发其财。因此，堤防越修越坏，灾情越来越严重。说起来，真痛恨！
    解放后，情况完全变了。中国共产党和人民政府为了广大人民的利益，动员和组织了广大的劳动人民，并派遣了大量的人民解放军和他们一道来与自然作斗争，大规模地展开防洪、排渍、防旱等措施，几年来已经取得了很大的成绩。大家知道的：全国各大、中河流的堤防已普遍地得到培修加固；荆江分洪、引黄济卫、佛子岭水库、官厅水库等许多伟大工程，都已胜利完成，并对减免水旱灾害起到很大作用。像1954年，长江中下游发生百年来未曾有过的、比1931年的洪水以汉口的最高洪水位来说要高出一公尺半之多的大洪水，也被我们战胜了。保卫着荆北大平原的荆江大堤安然无恙。武汉市、黄石市、南京市等重要城市安然无恙。这是一个奇迹。这只有在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的新中国，才能产生出来的。此外，汉水下游分洪、梅山水库、大伙房水库等等工程现正在施工，其中有的今年汛前就可完成。更伟大的是黄河的综合利用流域规划业已完成，并经全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过，即将逐步付诸实施，其中三门峡和刘家峡两大水库工程，现已开始设计；大规模的水土保持工作亦已开始进行。若干年后，这条一向被人们说成是有害无利的黄色的河流，将一变而为一条有利无害的清水河流了。
    继黄河的综合利用流域规划之后，其他许多河流的综合利用流域规划工作，现亦在进行中。其中汉水的综合利用流域规划不久就可完成。作为开发汉水第一期工程的丹江口水库工程设计，最近这次全国水利会议要求提前在1957年内就提出。汉水是长江的一条大支流，它的最大洪峰流量在襄阳、碾盘山一带达40，000秒公方，比黄河、淮河的最大洪峰流量都要大得多。丹江口水库，如正常高水位定为180公尺，总库容385亿公方，有效库容340亿公方，工程修成后，就防洪说，丹江口以上千年一遇的洪水可调节，使碾盘山以下洪峰不超过下游安全浅量12，000秒公方。丹江口以下地区发生千年一遇洪水时，配合泽口临时分洪亦可解决。就灌溉说，可为灌溉唐白河流域1，200万亩及引汉济黄济淮提供条件。就电力说，装机容量60—80万瓩，年平均发电量30—40亿度。就航运说，调节流量550秒公方，使下游终年通航吃水一又二分之一公尺的船舶。
    长江是我国最大的河流。它的流域面积为180万平方公里，约占全国总面积的五分之一。流域内有23，000万人口，约占全国总人口的五分之二，占全世界总人口的十分之一。气候温和，雨水充足，土壤肥沃，蕴藏丰富。长江的年径流量比美国的密西西比河大50％，比苏联最大的河流叶尼塞河大一倍，比伏尔加河大三倍，比黄河大二十五倍。开发长江的水利资源对发展我国工业、农业、交通运输业等国民经济各部门来说，占极其重要的地位。像长江这样大的综合利用流域规划工作是世界上从未有人做过的，而这个工作现已在苏联专家直接指导下着手进行中。今年年底以前可以提出长江流域规划要点。原计划在1958年提出长江综合利用流域规划报告，现因为了配合国家社会主义改造事业大发展新形势下的需要，要求提前一年完成，并希望在10至12年内就在长江干流上修成一个大水库。这个大水库如果修在三峡，正常高水位按235公尺计，总库容有1，370亿公方，有效库容1，050亿公方。完成后的工程效益：就防洪说，宜昌千年一遇洪峰流量可由96，500秒公方削减到30，000秒公方。再结合汉水、沅水等支流水库、小型水利、水土保持工作等，长江的水灾就将永远绝迹了。就电力说，每年平均发电量约为1，550亿度。为我国广大地区的电气化提供了条件，就航运说，调节下游流量11，700—13，200秒公方（保证率95％—50％），使万吨级的海轮可直航重庆或泸州。就农田水利说，因为有了廉价电力通过抽水灌溉、吸水排渍，使丘陵高地与湖泊洼地都可变为良田，可使我国的耕地面积大为增加。
    上面这些情况充分说明，在水利方面，我们已正在做着我们的前人所从来没有作过的极其光荣伟大的事业。
    在旧社会里，由于政治腐败，社会风气非常恶劣，贪污腐化，习以为常，以强取豪夺为能事，不肯同流合污为傻瓜。许多老水利工程师曾幻想要兴水利、除水害，为人民有所建树，但辛苦了一辈子，终于一事无成。新中国成立后，水利工作者才同全国人民一道站起来了。6年来，我们水利工作者在中国共产党的领导和教育下，通过一系列的伟大运动、工程实践和不断地努力学习，在思想认识、政治觉悟和业务水平上，获得了一定程度的进步，对国家水利建设事业，贡献出不少力量，取得了一定的成绩。但是这些进步还远远落后于客观形势发展的需要，必须急起直追迎头赶上；我们在工作中也还存在着许多的缺点和错误，必须迅速纠正，彻底革除。
    1、加强理论学习，克服保守思想：我们有许多水利技术工作同志，包括我自己在内，有这样一个共同的感觉：某些工作没有做好，走了弯路或不能如期完成任务的原因，并不是因为技术水平不够，而是由于思想方法和工作方法不对头，受到主观主义或右倾保守思想的影响，不从实际出发，考虑问题不全面所致。我们必须克服这些缺点，使在今后工作中，能做到“又多、又快、又好、又省”的要求。我们必须加强马克思列宁主义学习，提高政治思想水平。
    2、贯彻专家建议，学习先进经验：我们过去对学习和推广国内外先进经验及苏联专家建议重视不够，这是一个很大的缺点。为了提高我们的科学技术水平，为了使我们的科学技术水平尽可能快地赶上世界科学技术先进水平，绝对不能容许这个缺点继续保持下去。我们必须立即纠正这个缺点，并建立制度，保证贯彻执行。
    3、加强联系工作，反对本位主义：水利工作对国民经济各部门的关系很密切。编制一条河流的流域规划或做一个水利枢纽设计都必须与有关国民经济部门取得联系，协同办理。过去由于对这一点认识不够，注意不够，常常造成工作被动忙乱，并使国家受到损失。这个联系工作没有做好，有时是因为本位主义在作怪。因为我国水利事业，如上面所说的，也正在迅速地向前发展，我们必须吸取已往教训，反对本位主义，搞好联系工作，发扬集体主义精神，互相支援，共同努力，为我国伟大的社会主义水利建设事业的胜利推进而奋斗。
    最后，我向大家提出保证：我一定老老实实，勤勤恳恳，努力学习，努力工作，以共产党员的标准要求自己，在我国伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中，贡献出自己最大的力量。
