    The Mollet government, formed after the French elections, has been in power for over two weeks. The most urgent task facing the Mollet cabinet is restoring peace in Algeria. In his policy address to the French National Assembly seeking authorization, Mollet explicitly declared that his government would halt repression and terror in Algeria and resolve the Algerian issue through negotiations. The French Communist Party supports his cabinet because of Mollet's progressive policies on this issue and in some other domestic and foreign affairs, although the Mollet government does not fully meet the aspirations of the broad masses.
    Currently, for France, restoring peace in Algeria has become an urgent matter. As everyone knows, France has maintained 240,000 troops there to suppress the Algerian people's national liberation movement. This means that France has deployed nearly one-third of its army to wage this dirty colonial war. Minister without Portfolio Mendès-France once pointed out that France's forces in Algeria were "larger than the entire French force sent to Indochina on the eve of the fall of Dien Bien Phu." This army consumes hundreds of millions of francs in war expenses every day and suffers increasing casualties. But all this does nothing to ensure France's colonial rule in Algeria. Since last November, French colonial troops have massacred more than 13,000 Algerian civilians, but what has been achieved by this bloody record other than attracting condemnation from world public opinion? The Algerian people have not yielded to the policy of violence, and their determination to fight for independence and freedom is even stronger.
    It is precisely for this reason that opposition to the colonial war against the Algerian people has become increasingly strong in France, and even many bourgeois newspapers have pointed out that the war in Algeria is not only a shameful war, but also a hopeless one. They demand that the government learn from the painful lessons of Indochina and not repeat the same mistakes. For example, a Catholic weekly wrote: "The war in Algeria is a stupid thing. Which French politician dares to say that the people who fell in the Aurès conflict did not die in vain?" This public opinion in France has become an irresistible pressure, and any political leader who does not want to be spurned by the people must first come up with an effective way to stop the war in Algeria. This is also clearly seen by France's clear-headed politicians. On the eve of the recent election, Mendès-France said: "Peace in Algeria is the most important issue for France today. If the national will expressed in the January 2nd election is so, then this will be the primary task of the future government." And this will of the French people was indeed expressed in the election. Voters cast a large number of votes not only for the Communist Party, but also for the Socialist Party and other left-wing parties, one of the reasons being that these parties expressed their willingness to find ways to stop the war in Algeria.
    The French people's will to restore peace in Algeria was even more concentrated in the national movement for the day of struggle to stop the war in Algeria held on February 5th. About two thousand representatives from 65 provinces of France participated in a meeting held in the suburbs of Paris, and unanimously adopted a resolution demanding the cessation of the dirty war in Algeria and negotiations with qualified representatives of the Algerian people. This resounding voice of the upright French people cannot be ignored.
    Ending the colonial war in Algeria is of particular significance for the Mollet government. This is not only because it will be the first test facing the Mollet government, but also because it relates to the implementation of some other policies of the Mollet government. In his policy address, Mollet expressed his willingness to implement some economic reforms and measures to improve the lives of the working people. In his radio address to the French nation on February 18th, he repeatedly emphasized that he would do everything possible to improve the lives of the working people and "eliminate" inflation and currency devaluation. However, if the colonial war in Algeria continues to consume the national budget at a rate of hundreds of millions of francs per day, it is clear that all this will be very difficult to achieve. In that case, the Mollet government cannot expect to receive the support of the people. This is why Prime Minister Mollet immediately went to Algeria after taking office.
    After returning to Paris from Algeria, Mollet promised to implement a "progressive policy" in Algeria, including implementing social reforms, holding free elections as soon as possible, and defining a definite status for Algeria. However, he also stated that France would continue to maintain "its connection with Algeria" by force. Mollet said that "a calm atmosphere in which elections can be held" must be created before elections are held in Algeria. This is very contradictory to Mollet's promises. France maintains a large colonial army in Algeria and continues to implement repressive measures, which will absolutely not be conducive to the solution of the Algerian issue, but will only worsen the situation. The bloodshed that occurred again in Algeria on February 16th was caused by the French authorities' continued implementation of the policy of repression.
    In fact, the road to solving the Algerian problem is very clear. That is to negotiate with the true representatives of the Algerian people on the premise of recognizing and respecting the Algerian people's right to self-determination. The Algerian people have clearly expressed their national aspiration to strive for a free and independent Algeria free from colonial oppression, and to maintain free relations with France on the basis of equality and mutual respect for existing interests. This national demand is completely legitimate and reasonable, and it is acceptable to and should be accepted by the French side. The new constitution formulated by France after the war also clearly stipulates "avoiding all colonial policies based on arbitrariness." In fact, in today's unprecedented rise of the anti-colonial movement, it is impossible for any colonial country to resist this trend, and the result will only be self-destruction.
    But it must be pointed out that there are still some people in France who are trying to obliterate the national aspirations of the Algerian people. Although they see that the policy of repression is of no avail, and therefore cannot but negotiate with the representatives of Algeria, they still hope to impose a disguised "merger" plan that is in fact "assimilation" on the Algerian people. This plan will not have good results.
    It is particularly noteworthy that France's die-hard colonialists have recently conspired to create unrest in Algeria, and even organized thugs to demonstrate threats, attempting to manipulate the policies of the French government. This makes it all the more urgent for the French authorities to make a decisive decision and adopt resolute policies. And the first step should be to immediately stop the repression in Algeria, reduce the troops stationed in Algeria, and arrange a truly effective negotiation. This negotiation should be conducted either with representatives of various Algerian nationalist parties and organizations, or with a delegation that truly represents the Algerian people produced by free and democratic elections according to a proportional representation system. There is no doubt that any step taken by the French authorities in sincerely seeking to solve the Algerian problem will not only be supported by the French people, but can also be expected to receive the support of the Algerian people.

    摩勒政府的第一个考验
    谭文瑞
    法国大选后组成的新政府上台已有两个多星期了。摆在摩勒内阁面前的一个最急迫的任务就是恢复阿尔及利亚的和平。摩勒在要求法国国民议会授权而发表的施政纲领中曾明白宣布，他的政府将停止在阿尔及利亚的镇压和恐怖行动，通过谈判方式解决阿尔及利亚问题。法国共产党就是因为摩勒在这个问题上以及在其他一些内政和外交方面所揭橥的前进一步的政策而给予他的内阁以支持的，虽然摩勒政府并不完全符合广大群众的愿望。
    目前对于法国来说，恢复阿尔及利亚和平已成为一个急不容缓的问题。大家知道，为了镇压阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放运动，法国在那边保持了24万的驻军。这也就是说，法国已把它将近三分之一的军队用在进行这个肮脏的殖民战争上。现任不管部部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯曾经指出，法国在阿尔及利亚兵力“比奠边府陷落前夕法国派在印度支那的全部兵力还大。”这支军队每天要耗费数亿法郎的战费，遭受着日益增加的伤亡。但是所有这一切，并无助于确保法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。从去年11月以来法国的殖民军队已屠杀了13，000多名阿尔及利亚平民，但是这种血腥的纪录除了招致了世界舆论的谴责之外，有什么成效呢？阿尔及利亚人民并没有在暴力政策面前屈服，而且他们争取独立和自由的斗争意志更加坚决了。
    正是因为这样的原故，在法国国内反对对阿尔及利亚人民进行殖民战争的情绪愈来愈强烈，甚至许多资产阶级报刊也纷纷指出，在阿尔及利亚进行的战争不仅是一场可耻的战争，而且也是一场无望的战争。它们要求政府接受印度支那的惨痛教训，不要重蹈复辙。例如一个天主教的周刊就曾这样写道：“在阿尔及利亚进行的战争是一桩蠢事。有那一个法国的政治家敢于说在奥雷斯冲突中倒下的人们不是白死的？”法国国内的这种舆论已成为一种不可抗拒的压力，任何一个政治领袖如果不想被人民唾弃，就首先必须在停止阿尔及利亚战争的问题上拿出一套有效的办法来。这一点也是法国的头脑清醒的政治家们所清楚看到的。在最近的大选的前夕，孟戴斯—弗朗斯就这样说过：“阿尔及利亚和平是法国当前头等重要的问题。如果在1月2日选举中表达出来的全国的意愿是如此，那末这将是未来政府的首要任务。”而法国人民的这种意愿果然是在大选中表示出来了。选民们不仅对共产党，而且也对社会党和其他左翼政党投了大量的票，其原因之一，就是因为这些政党表示愿意设法停止阿尔及利亚的战争。
    法国人民要求恢复阿尔及利亚和平的意志，更集中反映在2月5日举行的全国争取停止阿尔及利亚战争日的运动中。法国65个省的约两千名代表参加了在巴黎近郊召开的会议，一致通过决议要求停止在阿尔及利亚进行的肮脏战争，同阿尔及利亚人民有资格的代表进行谈判。法国正直人民的这种响亮的声音，是绝对不能忽视的。
    结束阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，对于摩勒政府特别有着重要的意义。这不仅因为它将是摩勒政府所面临的第一个考验，而且也关系于摩勒政府其他一些政策的推行。摩勒在他的施政纲领中曾经表示愿意实行一些经济改革和改善劳动人民生活的措施。他2月18日向法国全国发表的广播演说中，也一再强调将尽一切可能改善劳动人民的生活以及“排除”通货膨胀和货币贬值的现象。然而，如果阿尔及利亚的殖民战争继续每天以数亿法郎计地消耗着国家的预算的话，很显然所有这一切都是很难办到的。那样的话，摩勒政府就不能指望得到人民的支持。这就是为什么摩勒总理上任之后就立即前往阿尔及利亚去的原因。
    摩勒从阿尔及利亚回到巴黎后，答应将在阿尔及利亚实行一项“进步政策”，包括实行社会改革、尽早举行自由选举和为阿尔及利亚规定确定的地位。但是，他又表示法国仍将以武力保持“它和阿尔及利亚的联系”。摩勒说，在阿尔及利亚举行选举之前必须造成“一种能够举行选举的平静气氛”。这和摩勒的诺言是十分矛盾的。法国在阿尔及利亚维持庞大的殖民军队，继续实行镇压措施，绝对不会有利于阿尔及利亚问题的解决，而只会使局面恶化下去。2月16日在阿尔及利亚又再发生的流血事件就是法国当局继续执行镇压政策所造成的。
    其实，解决阿尔及利亚问题的道路是很明显的。那就是在承认和尊重阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利的前提下，同阿尔及利亚人民的真正代表进行谈判。阿尔及利亚人民曾经明确地表明他们的民族愿望是争取一个摆脱殖民主义压迫的自由和独立的阿尔及利亚，而在平等和相互尊重现存利益的基础上同法国保持自由的联合的关系。这种民族要求是完全合法合理的，是法国方面能够接受同时也应该接受的。法国战后制定的新宪法也明白规定“避免一切基于武断之殖民政策”。事实上，在反殖民地浪潮空前高涨的今天，任何一个殖民国家妄想抗拒这种潮流，也是办不到的，结果只会自招没顶。
    但是必须指出，在法国目前还有着一些人企图抹杀阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望。他们虽然由于看到了镇压政策无济于事，因而不能不同阿尔及利亚的代表进行谈判，但是他们还是希望把那种事实上是“同化”的变相的“合并”计划强加在阿尔及利亚人民的身上。这种打算是不会有好结果的。
    特别值得注意的是，法国死硬的殖民主义者最近阴谋在阿尔及利亚制造骚乱，甚至组织暴徒示威来进行威胁，企图左右法国政府的政策。这就更迫切需要法国当局当机立断，采取果敢的政策。而第一步应该立刻停止在阿尔及利亚的镇压行动，撤减在阿尔及利亚的驻军，安排一个真正有成效的谈判。这个谈判或者同阿尔及利亚各民族主义政党和组织的代表进行，或者同经过自由、民主选举按照比例代表制产生的一个真正代表阿尔及利亚人民的代表团进行。毫无疑问，法国当局任何一个真心谋求解决阿尔及利亚问题的步骤，都必将不仅得到法国人民的拥护，而且也可以指望获得阿尔及利亚人民的支持。
