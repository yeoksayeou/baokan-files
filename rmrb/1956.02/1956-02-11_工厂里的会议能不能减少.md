Can Meetings in Factories Be Reduced?
    Wang Yuluo
    Many comrades working in factories feel that excessive meetings are a heavy burden. They not only directly affect the learning and health of employees, but also make it difficult to further invigorate work in all aspects. Especially now, when the broad masses of workers are striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, excessive meetings can become an obstacle to work. However, many comrades seem to express a sense of helplessness about this situation, as if reducing meetings is not easy or even impossible. The facts are not so. The situation at the Shanghai No. 2 State Cotton Factory proves that it is entirely possible to reduce the number of meetings and shorten meeting times.
    The general situation at the No. 2 State Cotton Factory is: too many meetings, too long meetings, and chaotic meetings.
    The Party Committee of the No. 2 State Cotton Factory was aware of the excessive number of meetings and made a resolution to reduce meetings in June 1955. This resolution had some effect. However, the phenomenon of too many meetings was not fundamentally corrected. Under normal circumstances, cadres above the level of group leader still had to attend meetings on Sundays, and when there were many tasks, ordinary Party and League members also attended meetings on Sundays, which they called "black meetings." By October 1955, the time spent by cadres and the masses on meetings each week, in addition to production and cultural and technical study time, was approximately 6 hours for the general public; approximately 8 hours for ordinary Party and League members; approximately 12 hours for group leaders; approximately 16 hours for workshop committee members; and up to 20 hours for Party and League branch secretaries and union chairpersons (including those who did not leave production). Cadres were trapped in meetings all day long, making it difficult to conduct in-depth and detailed mass work, and difficult to study themselves.
    From this point of view, it seems that the problem of too many meetings is indeed difficult to solve. However, if a specific analysis of the meeting situation at the No. 2 State Cotton Factory is carried out, the opposite answer will be obtained.
    Many meetings in this factory have repetitive content. For example, the summary of the completion of the workshop's monthly production plan and the arrangement and discussion of the next month's plan are carried out in separate meetings of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. In most workshops, the content and even the way these meetings are held are rarely different, or even have no difference. All Party and League members have to listen to a report, discuss it, and propose group and individual guarantee conditions at the workshop production meeting convened by the trade union; at the Party and League meetings, they have to listen to it again, discuss it again, and formulate an action plan once. As for the group leaders, because they have to attend preparatory meetings, they listen to reports three or four times. Cadres at the workshop level attend even more duplicated meetings. For example, the workshop director has to give a report on production issues at the beginning of the month at least five times, at administrative cadre meetings, branch committee meetings, trade union committee meetings, workshop production meetings, and Party branch meetings (or reported by the branch secretary). As for the daily Party and League group meetings, the inspection and discussion of production issues are also mostly repetitive in content with the trade union's group production meetings.
    The number of times various routine meetings are stipulated is excessive. For example, in addition to holding a general meeting once a month, the workshop Party organization, trade union, and Communist Youth League also stipulate that a group meeting should be held once a week. Sometimes there is really nothing to discuss at the group meeting, so they use reading newspapers to kill this one and a half hours of meeting time. In addition, each department also has departmental routine meetings. For example, the Party's propaganda department has a routine propaganda cadre meeting every week from the factory to the workshop.
    Therefore, as long as meetings with repetitive content are avoided, and as long as certain unnecessary routine meetings are reduced, not only can the number of meetings be greatly reduced, but also the quality of meetings can be improved.
    The factory's leadership cadres also rely on meetings to understand the situation. From the factory to the group, each system stipulates a weekly meeting system for reporting the situation level by level. Sometimes, in order to report a certain issue to the higher level or to study a problem, the leading cadres also often convene temporary reporting meetings. When there are crash tasks, meetings are held almost every day to report. The responsible cadres of the factory and workshop should understand the situation by going deep into the lower levels, participating in mass activities, inspecting work, and helping lower-level cadres solve problems, and should not only rely on holding reporting meetings to understand the situation.
    For general social and political activities, the No. 2 State Cotton Factory often does not distinguish the nature and object of the tasks, and routinely convenes meetings. Regardless of whether it is necessary or not, it mechanically adopts the method of "from inside the Party to outside the Party," "from cadres to the masses," and "from top to bottom" to carry it out. In this way, the number of meetings is bound to increase greatly. For example, from the perspective of the No. 2 State Cotton Factory, eliminating illiteracy is only a problem for a very small number of people, but it was universally mobilized three times in August, September, and October. For example, the nursery only has two illiterate people, one of whom is old and sick, and the other has too heavy a family burden and it is difficult to enroll. Yi Shijuan's group of 32 people only has one illiterate person, and is already preparing to enroll. However, these units cannot be exceptions, and all have to hold meetings, and all personnel must attend the meetings. There are many such social and political activities in the factory. From January to November 1955, there were 11 items such as peace signature and purchase of public bonds. Some of these matters obviously do not need to be carried out in the order of "first inside the Party and then outside the Party" and "first cadres and then the masses." If the factory leadership can, according to the specific circumstances, sometimes adopt the method of mobilizing cadres and the masses at one time, and sometimes only convene relevant people to listen to reports; and use other methods to carry out work whenever possible without holding meetings, and only hold meetings when it is necessary to do so. In this way, many meetings can be reduced again.
    The lack of long-term and unified planning in administrative management and doing one thing when encountering it is also an important reason for the large number of meetings. From January to November 1955, in addition to regular production tasks, there were also 12 important tasks in the No. 2 State Cotton Factory. Only a few of them were implemented in conjunction with daily production tasks, and the rest were arranged as special topics or needed to be arranged temporarily, thus also increasing the extra-curricular meeting activities time. In the future, these temporary tasks should be reduced as much as possible, and gradually incorporated into quarterly or monthly plans in advance.
    Not only can the number of meetings be greatly reduced, but the time of each meeting can also be greatly compressed. The main reasons for the long meeting time are too much content, too long reports, insufficient preparation, and the problems solved are not concentrated and not prominent. The workshop branch congress often copies all the tasks arranged by the factory Party committee. In November 1955, some workshops put forward eight major tasks at the branch congress. The branch secretary's report generally lasted for about an hour. In addition, the meeting must also have a summary and pass a resolution, and a meeting must take at least two hours. As for the group meetings of various systems, the time is also prolonged because the method of "everyone passing the test" must be adopted.
    This meeting method should be improved and can be improved. No matter what meeting it is, the problems discussed each time should be concentrated, and the solutions to the problems should be specific. This shortens the time and solves the problem. Individual units in the No. 2 State Cotton Factory have made such improvements, and the effect is very good.
    From the above situation, it can be seen that the large number and length of meetings are mainly caused by the lack of in-depth leadership style and the tendency of formalism in doing things according to routine. The reason why the Party Committee of the No. 2 State Cotton Factory did not control the meetings in the past was because it did not change its leadership style and working methods. If the leadership style can be completely changed, the meetings can definitely be greatly reduced. In addition, the upper-level leading organs do not have enough planning when arranging tasks, sometimes each system delivers "articles" and often demands it urgently, which also increases the difficulties for the factory, not only increasing the number of meetings, but also often disrupting the arrangement of meetings.

    工厂里的会议能不能减少
    王雨洛
    很多在工厂工作的同志都感到会议过多是一个沉重的负担，它不仅直接影响职工的学习和健康，而且使各方面的工作难以进一步活跃起来。特别是目前，当广大的职工群众正在为提前完成五年计划而奋斗的时候，过多的会议，更会成为工作的障碍。但是，有不少同志却对这种情况表现出无可奈何的情绪，似乎会议的减少是不太容易甚至不大可能的事情。事实并非如此，上海国棉二厂的情况就证明减少会议，缩短会议时间是完全可能的。
    国棉二厂的情况总起来说是：会议多、会议长、会议乱。
      国棉二厂党委对会议过多的情况是知道的，1955年6月份也曾做出减少会议的决议。这个决议也收到了一定的效果。但会议多的现象并没有根本纠正，一般情况下小组长以上的干部在星期天还要开会，而任务较多的时候，就是普通党员、团员星期天也照常开会，他们把这些会称做“黑会”。到1955年10月份，干部、群众除生产和文化技术学习时间外，每周参加会议的时间是：一般群众为6小时左右；普通党、团员为8小时左右；小组长一级为12小时左右；车间委员一级为16小时左右；而党、团支部书记，工会主席（包括不脱离生产的）则达20小时左右。干部终天陷于会议之中，就很难进行深入细致的群众工作，自己也很难进行学习。
    这样看来，似乎会议多的问题确实是很难解决的了。但是，如果对国棉二厂会议的情况进行一些具体分析，就会得到相反的答案。
    这个厂里的很多会议内容是重复的。如车间每月生产计划完成情况的总结及下月计划的布置讨论，都要分别召开党、行政、工会、青年团的会议来进行。多数车间这些会议的内容甚至会议的开法，都很少区别甚至没有区别。所有的党员、团员在参加工会召开的车间生产会议上要听一次报告，讨论一次，提出小组及个人保证条件；在党和团的会议上还得再听一次，讨论一次，订一次行动计划。至于小组长们，因为要参加预备会议，光听报告有三、四次。车间一级的干部参加的会议就重复得更多，如车间主任单是月初的生产问题报告，最少也要在行政干部会、支委会、工会委员会、车间生产会议、党支部大会（或由支部书记报告）上分别进行五次。至于日常党、团的小组会，对生产问题的检查和讨论跟工会的小组生产会议在内容上也多是重复的。
    各种例会的会议次数规定得过多，如车间党组织、工会、青年团除每月要分别召开一次大会外，还规定每周要开一次小组会。有时小组会实在没有什么问题可以讨论，就用读报来消磨这一个半钟头的会议时间。另外各部门，还有部门的例会，如党的宣传部门，从厂到车间，每周都有一次照例的宣传干部会。
    因此，只要避免内容重复的会议，只要减少某些不必要的例会，就不仅可以大大地减少会议的次数，而且可以提高会议的质量。
    这个厂里的各级领导干部了解情况也靠开会。从厂到小组，各系统都规定每周有一次逐级汇报情况的会议制度。有时为了向上级做某一问题的报告，或研究一个问题，领导干部还要经常召开临时性的汇报会议。有突击任务时，几乎每天召开会议汇报。而这种会议的时间往往很长。厂和车间的负责干部应该从深入下层、参加群众活动、检查工作和帮助下层干部解决问题中去了解情况，而不应该只依靠开汇报会了解情况。
      对于一般社会政治活动，国棉二厂往往不区别任务的性质、对象，照例都要召开会议，并且不管是否需要，一律机械地采取：“从党内到党外”、“从干部到群众”、“从上到下”的办法去进行。这样，会议的次数就势必大大增多。比如，扫除文盲，从国棉二厂的情况来看，只是极少数人的问题，但是却在八、十、十一三个月中普遍动员了三次，像托儿所只有两个文盲，一个年老多病，一个家庭负担太重，很难入学；裔式娟小组32个人中，只有一个文盲，而且已经准备入学。但这些单位都不能例外，都要开会，而且开会时所有人员都必须出席。工厂中的这种社会政治活动很多，1955年1至11月，就有和平签名、认购公债等11项，其中有些事情显然是用不着按照“先党内后党外”，“先干部后群众”的次序去进行。工厂的领导方面如果能够根据具体情况，有的采取对干部和群众一次动员的办法，有的只召集有关的人听报告；凡是能够不开会的，就采用其他方法去进行工作，只在必须开会时才开。这样，会议就又可以减少很多。
    行政管理工作上缺乏长远与统一的计划，碰到一样做一样，也是会议多的重要原因。1955年1至11月份除经常生产任务外，在国棉二厂就还有12项重要工作，其中只有少数是结合日常生产任务贯彻执行的，其余都是作为专题布置或需要临时安排，因而也增加了业余的会议活动时间。今后，应该尽可能地减少这些临时任务，逐步做到事先把它们纳入季度或月度的计划中。
    不仅会议的次数可以大大减少，每次会议的时间也可以大大压缩。会议时间长的主要原因是内容太多，报告太长，准备不充分，解决的问题不集中、不突出。车间支部大会，往往将厂党委所布置的任务全部照抄照搬。1955年11月份，有的车间在支部大会上就提出了8大任务。支部书记的报告，一般都长达一个小时左右。此外会议照例还得有总结，要通过决议，一次会议起码得两小时。至于各个系统的小组会，也因为都要采取“人人过关”的办法，而把时间拖得很长。
    这种开会方法是应该改进而且可以改进的。不论什么会议，每次讨论的问题要集中，解决问题的办法要具体。这样既缩短时间，又解决问题。国棉二厂个别单位已经作了这样的改进，效果很好。
    从以上情况可以看出，会议多和会议长，主要还是由于领导作风的不深入，以及按照常规办事的形式主义倾向所造成。国棉二厂党委过去所以没有控制住会议，就是因为没有去转变领导作风和工作方法。领导作风能够彻底转变，会议就一定可以大大减少。另外，上级领导机关布置任务的时候计划性不够，有时各系统“条条”下达，而且，往往要求很急，这也给工厂增加了困难，不仅使会议次数增加，也往往打乱会议的安排。
