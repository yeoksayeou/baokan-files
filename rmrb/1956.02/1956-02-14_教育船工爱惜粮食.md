To the Editor:

    According to statistics from the Hechuan Grain Transfer Station in Sichuan Province: From January to August 1955, over 128,000 jin of damp grain and moldy, deteriorated, sprouted grain were swept from the bottoms of the grain boats arriving in Hechuan from various locations after unloading. This means that for every 10,000 jin of grain transported, an average of 7 jin were lost. In addition, there were many boat accidents. From January to November 1955, 34 accidents occurred within the jurisdiction of Hechuan City alone, resulting in a loss of over 81,000 jin of grain.

    The main reason for the above situation is that some boatmen do not cherish the state's grain enough. They mistakenly believe that "losses are unavoidable in water transportation." In fact, if the boatmen could cherish the grain, losses could be completely avoided. For example, Feng Duoxi, the director of the Qianjin Wooden Boat Transportation Production Cooperative in Daxian Port, once led eight grain boats loaded with over 125,000 jin of grain from Daxian to Hechuan, a journey of 1,380 li. Because everyone was actively responsible and regularly checked the safety equipment, there was no loss of grain.

    Therefore, I suggest that shipping units and grain departments should strengthen the education of boatmen in the organization of grain transportation work and promote the experience of safe transportation.

### 教育船工爱惜粮食

    教育船工爱惜粮食编辑同志：
    根据四川省合川粮食转运站统计：从1955年1月到8月，由各地开往合川的粮船在卸载后，舱底扫出的潮粮和霉烂变质生芽的粮食有128，000多斤，平均每运一万斤粮食就要损失7斤。此外，船只失事的情况也很多，1955年1月到11月仅在合川市辖区内就发生了34起，共损失粮食81，000多斤。
    造成以上情况的原因，主要是有一部分船工对国家的粮食不够爱护。他们错误地认为“水上运输，损失是难免的”。事实上，如果船工能够爱护粮食，损失完全是可以避免的。例如，达县港前进木船运输生产合作社的社长冯多锡，在一次带领8只粮船从达县装粮125，000多斤到合川，运途长达1，380里。由于大家积极负责，经常检查安全设备，粮食没有受到一点损失。
    因此，我建议航运单位和粮食部门在组织粮食运输工作中，应该加强对船工的教育，并且推广安全运输的经验。
