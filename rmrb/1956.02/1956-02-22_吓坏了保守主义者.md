    Wu Caimin, the leader of the shaper group at the Shanghai Tool Factory, heard that their group would be short 787 work hours next month, failing to complete the plan required by the factory. The chief foreman said he would ask the higher authorities to reduce the task.
    Upon hearing this, Wu Caimin thought: we cannot bow our heads in the face of difficulties! He went back and brainstormed with everyone, and they formulated the group's guarantee conditions—not only would they not reduce the 787 missing work hours, but they would complete all of them, and also guarantee to reduce defective products by half compared to the original target.
    The workshop director was shocked when he saw these guarantee conditions. He dissuaded the team members, saying: "You are being too adventurous, I don't believe you will complete it."
    The result again exceeded the workshop director's expectations: this group completed the month's production plan ahead of schedule by two days and comprehensively exceeded the quota.
    Those who do not believe in the power of the masses, put away those arguments that accuse the masses of being "too adventurous," throw yourselves into the masses to transform yourselves, and lead the masses before they lead you! Otherwise, when the masses open fire on bureaucracy and conservative thinking, what awaits you may be more than just being "scared."

    吓坏了保守主义者
    上海工具厂铲床小组长吴才敏听到：下个月他们小组缺787个工时，完不成厂部要求的计划。总工长说要向上级要求削减任务。
    吴才敏一听，心想：不能在困难面前低头啊！回去就和大家一起想办法，订出了小组的保证条件——除了787个缺额工时一个不减，全部可以完成外，还保证废次品比原来的指标减少一半。
    车间主任一看这个保证条件，吓了一跳，他劝阻组员说：“你们太冒险了，我不相信你们会完成。”
    结果又出乎车间主任的意料：这个小组提前两天，全面超额完成了这个月份的生产计划。
    不相信群众的力量的人，收起那些指责群众“太冒险”之类的论调，投身到群众中去改造自己，赶到群众之前去领导群众吧！否则，当群众向官僚主义、保守思想开起火来的时候，等待着自己的恐怕不仅是“吓了一跳”而已。
