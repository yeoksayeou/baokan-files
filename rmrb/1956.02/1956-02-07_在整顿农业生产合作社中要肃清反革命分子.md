In the current rectification of agricultural production cooperatives to prepare for the launch of the Great Production Movement, it is imperative to pay close attention to purging counter-revolutionaries.

The agricultural cooperativization movement is an intense class struggle, and counter-revolutionaries and other criminals will inevitably, and indeed are, carrying out various acts of sabotage. However, some of our cadres, amidst the rapid development of agricultural cooperatives, have not raised their vigilance, resulting in the infiltration of many bandits and core members of the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League into some cooperatives. Therefore, when rectifying cooperatives, all localities must be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage and pay attention to rectifying cooperatives politically based on the Party's class line in rural areas. This means that rectification should not only focus on business management, fixed quotas for work, labor organization, and other aspects, but also pay attention to the political dimension; otherwise, cooperatives cannot be properly rectified. In this regard, the experience and lessons of Tanbai Cooperative in Yongning County, Guangxi Province, are worth referencing by all localities. This cooperative had problems, and the Party branch and work team conducted multiple rectifications, adopting many measures such as guiding members to recognize the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, strengthening unity, and improving contract work, but the problems remained unresolved. Later, the district committee, the Party branch, and cooperative management cadres strengthened political leadership over all members, especially leading cadres, according to the Party's class policy, discovered and purged hidden counter-revolutionaries, and the cooperative took on a new look.

The experience of Tanbai Cooperative's rectification demonstrates that during rectification, it is essential to fully mobilize the masses, especially relying on poor and lower-middle peasants, firmly uniting middle peasants, distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, isolating hidden counter-revolutionaries, and fully exposing them. Some staff members lack clear class viewpoints, listening only to the sweet talk of bad elements, relying on them to run the cooperative, and relying on them to rectify the cooperative. One can imagine what the result will be. For example, in the spring of 1955, the staff members of the Rural Work Department of the Linru County Committee in Henan Province, who were sent to Dawangzhuang to rectify the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative, did not delve into the masses, did not rely on the poor peasants, but listened to the words of counter-revolutionaries, and as a result, fell for the counter-revolutionaries' tricks of sowing discord.

Rectifying cooperatives requires starting with production, investigating incidents of production sabotage to expose and strike at hidden enemies. The reason cooperatives strongly attract peasants is primarily because of their significant superiority in production, so counter-revolutionaries will inevitably concentrate their efforts and use various tricks to sabotage the cooperative's production. In Tanbai Cooperative, due to the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries, 18 head of cattle died, and the planned harvest of 160,000 jin of early rice in 1955 fell short of 110,000 jin. During the rectification, members investigated the reasons for the production chaos and exposed hidden enemies. As a result, the agricultural cooperative was rectified and production improved.

The experience of Tanbai Cooperative's rectification also tells us that counter-revolutionaries are accustomed to exploiting the selfish mentality of some members for sabotage. Therefore, all localities should strengthen the political work of cooperatives during rectification, continuously raise the socialist consciousness of members, establish the concept of "loving and protecting the cooperative, treating it as home," criticize and constantly overcome the backward, selfish thinking of the small-peasant economy and the influence of capitalist ideas, to block loopholes for counter-revolutionary attacks. Grassroots cadres must regularly conduct class struggle education for members, helping them to identify all counter-revolutionaries attempting to carry out sabotage using double-dealing tactics. In addition, attention should be paid to establishing and improving the cooperative's financial accounting, warehouse management, scoring and work recording, livestock breeding, and other systems during rectification, so that counter-revolutionaries have no opportunity to exploit.

Currently, rural security work is far from being able to meet the needs of the rapidly developing cooperativization movement. This situation must be changed. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees, local public security and judicial organs must seize the link of rectifying cooperatives to further carry out security work in the cooperativization movement. It should be understood that purifying the organization and leadership of the cooperative is a key issue in consolidating the cooperative. It must be ensured that the leadership of the cooperative is truly in the hands of politically reliable working people. Existing counter-revolutionaries and other criminals who have infiltrated the cooperative must be seriously dealt with according to the specific circumstances.

In the rectification work in various localities, the security organizations within the cooperatives should be universally rectified once. Those that have not been established should be established, and those that have been established should be further consolidated and improved. All security organizations should strengthen leadership and establish regular work. The security work for the cooperative's livestock, warehouses, large farm tools, and water conservancy facilities should be strengthened, and necessary safety systems should be established in coordination with breeding, accounting, technical, and management aspects, to proactively prevent the enemy's sabotage, do a good job in the security work during the harvest season and various production processes, and launch a mass prevention movement, so that the cooperative's security work becomes the conscious action of the vast majority of members.

In the rectification of the cooperative, for the enemy's current sabotage activities against the cooperativization movement, such as spreading rumors, assault, arson, and harming livestock, public security and judicial organs must promptly detect and solve the cases and severely suppress them. Only in this way can the healthy development of the cooperativization movement be protected, and the members and the masses outside the cooperative be further educated to raise their vigilance. In addition, the security work of key cooperatives and model cooperatives should be strengthened to gain experience and promote the general.

Comrade Mao Zedong once instructed us: "The rectification of cooperatives is not done once a year, but two to three times a year." In order to better implement this instruction, Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, incorporate security work into the overall plan of the cooperativization movement, mobilize and organize all cooperative management cadres, and not only do a good job in production during the rectification but also protect production.

### 在整顿农业生产合作社中要肃清反革命分子

    在整顿农业生产合作社中要肃清反革命分子
    目前，许多农业生产合作社正在进行整顿，为开展大生产运动做好准备。在整顿合作社中，必须切实注意肃清反革命分子。
    农业合作化运动是一场激烈的阶级斗争，反革命分子和其他各种犯罪分子必然会而且事实上也正在进行各种破坏活动。而我们的某些干部在农业合作社的大发展中，没有提高警惕性，以致有的合作社混进了许多土匪和国民党、三青团的骨干分子。因此，各地在整顿合作社的时候，必须警惕敌人对于合作社的破坏，注意根据党在农村的阶级路线从政治上整顿合作社。这就是说，不仅仅要从经营管理、定额包工、劳动组织等等方面整社，而且要从政治方面加以注意，否则就不能把合作社整顿好。在这方面，广西省邕宁县坛白社的经验教训是值得各地参考的。这个社发生了问题，党支部、工作组曾经进行了多次整顿，也采取过不少办法，如引导社员认识农业合作社的优越性、加强团结、搞好包工等等，但是一直解决不了问题。后来，区委、党支部和办社干部按照党的阶级政策，对全社成员特别是领导骨干加强了政治领导，发现并且肃清了暗藏的反革命分子，于是，社的面目为之一新。
    坛白社整社的经验证明，在整社的时候，一定要充分发动群众，特别要依靠贫农和下中农，巩固地团结中农，分清敌我，以孤立暗藏的反革命分子，并且把他们完全暴露出来。有些工作人员阶级观点极不明确，只偏听偏信坏分子的花言巧语，依靠坏分子来办社，也依靠坏分子来整社。可以想到，这会整出什么结果来。例如，河南临汝县县委农村工作部1955年春天派到大王庄去整顿第二农业生产合作社的工作人员，没有深入群众，不依靠贫农，却听信了反革命分子的话，结果，中了反革命分子的挑拨离间的诡计。
    整顿合作社要注意从生产入手，从追查破坏生产的事故中去揭发和打击暗藏的敌人。合作社所以强烈地吸引着农民，首先是因为它在生产上有显著的优越性，所以反革命分子必然集中力量，使用种种伎俩破坏合作社的生产。坛白社由于反革命分子的破坏，耕牛死了18头，1955年早糙原计划收16万斤，却连11万斤也收不到。在整社中社员纷纷追查生产混乱的原因，揭发了暗藏的敌人。结果农业社整顿好了，生产也搞好了。
    坛白社整社的经验又告诉我们，反革命分子惯于抓住一部分社员的自私心理进行破坏。因此，各地在整社中应该加强合作社的政治工作，不断提高社员的社会主义觉悟，树立社员“爱社护社、以社为家”的观念，批判和不断克服小农经济的落后、自私思想和资本主义的思想影响，以堵塞反革命分子进攻的漏洞。基层干部必须经常向社员进行阶级斗争的教育，帮助他们识别一切企图用两面派手法进行破坏的反革命分子。此外，在整社中还要注意建立和健全合作社的财务会计、仓库保管、评分记工、牲畜饲养等制度，使反革命分子无隙可乘。
    目前，农村保卫工作还远远不能适应合作化运动迅速发展的需要。这种情况必须改变。各地公安、司法机关要在党委的统一领导下，抓紧整顿合作社这一环节，进一步开展合作化运动中的保卫工作。应该了解，纯洁合作社的组织和领导是巩固合作社的一个关键问题。必须保证社的领导权真正掌握在政治上十分可靠的劳动人民手里。如果现有混入社内的反革命分子和其他各种犯罪分子，必须根据具体情况严肃地加以处理。
    各地在整社工作中，要把合作社内的保卫组织普遍地作一次整顿，没有建立的要建立起来，已经建立的要进一步巩固和提高。所有的保卫组织都要加强领导，建立起经常工作。要加强对合作社的牲畜、仓库、大型农具、水利设施的保卫工作，协同饲养、会计、技术、保管等方面订立必要的安全制度，主动防范敌人的破坏，作好收获季节和各个生产过程的保卫工作，发动群众性的防护运动，使合作社的保卫工作成为广大社员群众自觉的行动。
    在整社中对于敌人对合作化运动的现行破坏活动，如制造谣言、行凶、纵火、暗害牲畜等，公安、司法机关要及时侦察破获，严厉镇压。这样才能够保卫合作化运动的健康发展，并且进一步教育社员和社外群众，提高他们的警惕性。另外，要加强对重点社和模范社的保卫工作，以取得经验，推动一般。
    毛泽东同志曾经指示我们：“整社不是一年整一次，而是一年整两次至三次。”为了更好地执行这个指示，各级党委要加强领导，把保卫工作列入合作化运动的全面规划，动员和组织全体办社干部，在整社中不仅要搞好生产，而且要保卫生产。
