    Reasonably Change Process Regulations, Tap Potential

    Technical personnel and workers of the Shenyang Screw Factory closely cooperated and rationally improved the production process of spring washers 4 times, simplifying the process. Without increasing equipment, the production capacity of the spring washer production line was increased by 13 times; the specifications increased from 3 to 23; the quality changed from low-grade standards to high-grade standards, and some reached international standards; the cost was reduced by nearly 90%.
    Spring washers are a component of new agricultural implements. Previously, there were 6 operations and 27 processes. The processes were numerous, the output was small, the cycle was long, and the quality was low. According to calculations, the entire production line traveled more than 20 kilometers back and forth. With the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the demand for new agricultural implements increased greatly, and the production of spring washers could not keep up with the supply, affecting the inability of brother factories to assemble agricultural implements with complete sets of parts before shipping. In response to this problem, the factory's technical personnel and workers worked closely together and learned from advanced Soviet experience, making 4 major improvements to the spring washer's process technology. The first improvement was to the smothering heat treatment method, which saved coal and shortened the annealing time, reducing the production cycle from 11 days to about 7 days. After improving the operating method of the heat treatment process, the cutting process went from being underfed to being unable to finish the work. They also made a set of cutting fixtures based on Soviet cutting tool data, which increased the output by more than 10 times and the quality fully met the requirements. After the improvement of the smothering and cutting processes, the coiling process became a weak link again. They jointly studied lengthening the coiling mandrel, which extended the length of the coiled spring, increasing the output by nearly 3 times, and the steel wire utilization rate also increased from 75% in the past to about 90%. After these three improvements, the production of spring washers was balanced in each process. In order to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, they continued to learn from advanced Soviet experience, changing the normalizing process of spring steel wire to recrystallization annealing, so that the steel wire heat treatment could be carried out in a general smothering furnace, which not only increased production and was suitable for processing, but also reduced two processes, saving a lot of electricity and avoiding the corrosion of steel wire by salts, saving more than 30,000 yuan per year.
      Now, the engineering technicians and workers are also preparing to reform the process technology on more standard parts for agricultural implements to further increase production.
    This fact proves that as long as engineering technicians and workers actively learn from advanced experience, study technology, and use the latest technological achievements to reasonably improve process technology and production organization, it is entirely possible. Unfortunately, some factory and mine leaders and technicians still regard process regulations as immutable and do not allow others to change them at all. For example, after Xue Jinglian, a young milling worker in Workshop No. 1 of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, learned the Soviet "milling worker method," he found that the angle of the milling cutter he was using was insufficient and the cutting depth was too small, and he wanted to reasonably improve it. Some workshop technicians said that the milling cutter was made according to the design and could not be changed. Later, due to Xue Jinglian's persistence in the struggle and the support of other technicians, it was improved. As a result of the improvement, not only did the quality of the workpiece meet the required standards, but the efficiency of milling a bed headstock was shortened from 100 minutes after compression of the quota to 38 minutes. After careful research, the cadres, technicians, and workers of Workshop 514 of the Shenyang Chemical Plant confirmed that if the operating procedures were improved, the number of synthesis times for producing "666" insecticide raw powder could be increased, but some leaders of the plant suppressed this suggestion by saying it "violated the operating procedures"; after criticism, the suggestion was adopted.
    Process regulations are the guidelines for employees' production activities and are technical documents that ensure product quality and quantity. Of course, everyone in the enterprise must implement them and cannot change them casually. However, process regulations are formulated based on certain scientific and technological achievements and the technical level of employees. When science and technology have developed and the technical level of employees has improved, as long as they undergo on-site testing and certain procedures, reasonable changes are entirely possible and necessary. Otherwise, production cannot be continuously improved. Therefore, leaders of industrial and mining enterprises must overcome conservative thinking and, when engineering technicians and workers propose to change process regulations, actively help them conduct experiments. After proving that the change is indeed beneficial, change them according to the prescribed procedures.

    合理改变工艺规程，挖掘潜力
    边闻
    沈阳螺钉厂技术人员和工人密切合作，4次合理改进弹簧垫圈的生产工艺，简化工序，在不增加设备的条件下，使弹簧垫圈作业线的生产能力提高13倍；规格由3种增到23种；质量由低级标准达到高级标准，部分达到国际标准；成本降低将近90％。
    弹簧垫圈是新农具的一个部件，以前共有6道作业27道工序。工序多、产量少、周期长、质量低，据计算全部作业线往返竟长达20多公里。随着农业合作化高潮的到来，新农具需要量大增，弹簧垫圈的生产就供应不上，影响兄弟工厂生产的农具不能全套装配出厂。针对这个问题，这个厂的技术人员和工人密切合作，学习苏联先进经验，先后对弹簧垫圈的工艺技术作了4次重大改进。第一次改进焖火热处理的方法，省了煤，又缩短了退火时间，使生产循环期由11天降至7天左右。热处理工序改进操作方法后，切口工序由吃不饱变为吃不了。他们又根据苏联切口工具资料，做成了一套切口卡具，产量提高10倍多，质量完全合乎要求。焖火、切口工序的改进，卷缠工序又变为薄弱环节。他们又共同研究把卷簧芯杆加长，延长了卷簧的长度，提高产量近3倍，钢丝利用率也由过去75％提高到90％左右。经过这三次改进，弹簧垫圈的生产各工序已经取得了平衡。为了做到又多、又快、又好、又省，他们又继续学习苏联先进经验，把弹簧钢丝正常化工序改为再结晶退火，使钢丝热处理在一般焖火炉内进行，不但提高产量和适合加工，还可减少两道工序，节省大量电力，避免钢丝被盐类腐蚀，每年可以节约3万多元。
      现在，工程技术人员和工人还准备在更多的农具标准件上改革工艺技术，进一步提高生产。
    这一事实证明，只要工程技术人员和工人积极学习先进经验，研究技术，用最新技术成就来合理改进工艺技术和生产组织，是完全可能的。可惜，现在有些厂矿的领导人员和技术人员，还把工艺规程看成是一成不变的东西，不许别人动它一根毫毛。例如，沈阳第一机床厂一号车间青年铣工薛景连，学习苏联“铣工工作法”之后，发现自己所用的铣刀角度不够，吃刀量太小，要合理改进一番，有些车间技术人员却说铣刀是按设计做的，不能改。后来由于薛景连坚持斗争，并且取得了其他技术员的支持，才改进了。改进的结果，不仅工作物质量达到要求标准，并且使铣一个床头箱的效率由压缩定额后的100分钟又缩短为38分钟。沈阳化工厂514车间的干部、技术人员和工人经过周密的研究，确认操作规程如果加以改进，生产“六六六”杀虫剂原粉的合成次数完全可以增多，但是，工厂的一些领导人员竟以“违反操作规程”来压制；经过批判以后，才采纳了这一建议。
    工艺规程是职工生产活动的准则，是保证产品质量和数量的技术文件，企业里任何人当然必须执行，不能随便改动。但是，工艺规程是根据一定的科学技术成就和职工的技术水平制定的，当科学技术已经发展，职工的技术水平已经提高了的时候，只要经过实地的试验和一定的手续，加以合理改变，是完全可能和必要的。否则，生产就不可能不断提高。因此，工矿企业的领导人员，必须克服保守思想，在工程技术人员和工人提出要改变工艺规程的时候，积极帮助他们进行试验，证明改变的确有好处以后，再按照规定的手续加以改变。
