    The Fate of Five Truckloads of Ore
    To the Editor:
    On August 16, 1955, the Longyan Iron Mine in Pangjiabu entrusted the railway department to transport five freight cars of iron ore (a total of 150 tons) to our Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. However, by the end of 1955, these five cars of iron ore had not yet arrived. After repeated inquiries, the railway department began to search for them. It turned out that the train transporting these five cars of ore had an overturning accident between Yangfangkou Station and Ningwu Station. At that time, three cars of ore overturned into a ravine more than 40 meters deep, and two cars overturned beside the road. After the accident, the relevant departments of the Taiyuan Railway Administration adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the lost goods; therefore, our factory did not know the whereabouts of these five cars of ore for a long time, which affected the supply of materials for production.

    五车矿石的命运编辑同志：
    1955年8月16日，庞家堡龙烟铁矿委托铁路部门给我们太原钢铁厂运来了5个车皮的铁矿石（共150吨）。但是，一直到1955年底，这5车铁矿石还没有运到。经过我们多次查询，铁路部门才开始找寻。原来运输这5车矿石的列车行至阳方口车站和宁武车站间发生了颠复事故，当时有3车矿石翻在道台下面40多公尺的深处，两车矿石倒在道旁，事故发生以后，太原铁路管理局有关部门对于损失的货物采取了不负责任的态度；因此我们厂里就长期不知道这5车矿石的下落，以致影响了生产用料的供应工作。
