Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    A letter from the office of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League: The letter reflecting the chaotic work situation of the Xuanwu District Committee of the Communist Youth League, published on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 15th, has been studied by us. We believe that the reason for this chaotic situation is that some League organizations have not properly arranged work and meeting times, resulting in low work efficiency and meeting quality. In response to the above situation, we plan to improve in the following aspects: (1) Educate organization cadres to improve work efficiency and quality, and establish normal work order; (2) Reduce unnecessary meetings, conscientiously prepare for meetings, improve meeting quality, and require cadres to spend more time among the masses; (3) Strengthen the meeting forecast system to unify the arrangement of meeting times; (4) Reasonably arrange spare time to ensure cadres' learning and necessary recreational and sports activities.

    A letter from the Sichuan Provincial Labor Bureau: The opinion raised in the letter "The Distress of Not Having Time to Educate Children" on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 15th is correct. In the past, although we stipulated that the evenings of Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday should not occupy the spare time of staff, we did not implement this seriously. This was mainly because we lacked a mass perspective, did not value the reasonable demands of staff, and even believed that people who raised such reasonable demands were undisciplined, etc. Now we have established a system to ensure that staff have sufficient spare time.

    A letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Department: The criticism of the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Department's Yangtze River Brick and Tile Factory's backlog of ships on the "Reader's Letters" page on December 18, 1955, is correct. We have contacted relevant parties and dealt with the 5 motorized sailboats and small tugboats backlogged by the Yangtze River Brick and Tile Factory: In addition to scrapping 4 ships that were old, dilapidated, and no longer of use, and turning over the proceeds, the remaining 1 ship, along with all the seamen, was transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Transportation for use.

    A letter from the Xishan Mining Bureau: The criticism of "Dangerous Locomotive Coal" published on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 22nd is correct. For a long time, our mine has not completely eliminated the incidents of detonators and explosives being mixed into coal. This is mainly because we lack the necessary understanding of the seriousness of this issue, lack a high sense of responsibility for our work, and there is confusion in our management work. In order to completely prevent this phenomenon from occurring, we have taken measures such as preventing misfires and establishing an inspection system.

    After the "Reader's Letters" page published the reader's letter "The Mistakes of Gu Binyu Must Be Seriously Dealt With" on December 11, 1955, the Dongdan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, based on Gu Binyu's consistent suppression of democracy, violation of laws and regulations, and serious destructive behavior towards children at Chaoyangmen Elementary School, has decided to expel Gu Binyu from the Party. The Culture and Education Section of Dongdan District in Beijing has also removed Gu Binyu from his current position as Principal of Suzhou Hutong Elementary School.

    A letter from the Hebei Provincial Inland Water Navigation Administration: The criticism of "A Messy Account" published on the "Reader's Letters" page on January 29th is consistent with the facts. We have actively cleared the old accounts and are preparing to establish a financial system to prevent similar situations from occurring.

    A letter from the Heilongjiang Provincial Higher People's Court: After the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page published the letter "What Kind of Sentencing Standard Is This?" on January 29th, we immediately convened a meeting of all the judges who handled the case of Liu Yunzhao's drowning of his child to study this issue. Everyone believes that the People's Daily's criticism is completely correct. We will learn from this incident and improve our future trial work. According to legal supervision procedures, the Supreme People's Court has already transferred all the materials of this case and will either retry the case or order us to retry it.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    青年团北京市委员会办公室来信：1月15日“读者来信专页”发表了反映青年团宣武区委会工作忙乱现象的来信。经我们研究，造成这种忙乱现象的原因是一些团的机关没有妥善地安排工作和会议时间，以致工作效率和会议质量不高。针对以上情况，我们准备从以下几方面改进：（一）教育机关干部提高工作效率和工作质量，建立正常的工作秩序；（二）减少不必要的会议，认真做好会议的准备工作，提高会议质量，要求干部有更多的时间到群众中去；（三）加强会议预报制度，以便统一安排会议时间；（四）合理安排业余时间，保证干部的学习和必要的文娱体育活动时间。

    四川省劳动局来信：1月15日“读者来信专页”上“没有时间教育子女的苦恼”一信中提出的意见是正确的。过去，我们虽然曾经规定每星期一、三、四晚上不占用工作人员的业余时间，但是没有认真执行。这主要是因为我们缺乏群众观点，没有重视工作人员的合理要求，甚至还认为提出这种合理要求的人是自由散漫等等。现在我们已经订出制度，保证工作人员有充分的业余活动时间。

    江苏省公安厅来信：1955年12月18日“读者来信专页”对我厅所属长江砖瓦厂积压轮船的批评是正确的。我们已同有关方面联系，对长江砖瓦厂积压的5只机帆船和小型拖轮作了处理：除把4只年久失修、已无利用价值的轮船报废变值上缴外，其余1只连同全部海员工人移交江苏省交通厅使用。

    西山矿务局来信：1月22日“读者来信专页”上发表的“危险的机车用煤”的批评是正确的。长期以来，我矿没有彻底杜绝雷管炸药混入煤中的事件。这主要因为我们对这一问题的严重性缺乏应有的认识，对工作没有高度的责任感和管理工作中存在着混乱现象。为了彻底防止这种现象的发生，我们已经采取了防止瞎炮和建立检查制度等措施。

    1955年12月11日“读者来信专页”发表了“必须严肃处理谷斌玉的错误”的读者来信以后，中共北京市东单区委员会根据谷斌玉在朝阳门小学一贯压制民主、违法乱纪和无理摧残儿童的严重错误行为，已经决定开除谷斌玉的党籍。北京市东单区文教科也已经撤销了谷斌玉现任苏州胡同小学校长的职务。

    河北省内河航运管理局来信：1月29日“读者来信专页”发表的“一笔糊涂账”的批评是符合事实的。我们已积极地清理了旧账，并准备建立财务制度，以杜绝类似情况的发生。

    黑龙江省高级人民法院来信：1月29日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表“这是什么量刑标准？”的来信以后，我们立即召集了处理刘云照溺子致死案的全体审判员会议研究这个问题。大家认为人民日报的批评完全正确。我们将从这一事件中吸取教训，改进今后的审判工作。按照法律监督程序，最高人民法院已经调走这一案件的全部材料，将对这一案件重新改判或责成我们更审。
