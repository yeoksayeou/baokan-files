    Shanxi Province is in the stage of comprehensively rectifying and consolidating its newly established 16,500+ advanced agricultural production cooperatives.

    The rectification work of these advanced cooperatives generally follows three steps: ideological education, formulation of production plans, rectification of labor organization, establishment of management institutions, and handling the issue of collectivization of means of production. Currently, all advanced cooperatives in the province have established management institutions. In accordance with the new situation of increased numbers of member households and expanded business scope after the merging and transitioning of cooperatives, appropriate adjustments and arrangements have been made to the original cooperative cadres to strengthen the leadership of basic production units such as production teams and groups, and to establish the advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in the leadership.

    All newly established advanced cooperatives in the province have formulated this year's production increase plans, and some cooperatives have also formulated long-term agricultural development plans for the next 7 to 12 years. Furthermore, 80% of the cooperatives in the province have completed or are in the process of handling the collectivization of major means of production such as privately owned land, draught animals, and farm tools. After these advanced cooperatives divided cultivation areas and production teams, and gradually implemented quota management and piece-rate payment systems, the labor productivity of the members quickly improved. The general labor efficiency increased by 20% to 30% compared with the same period before the transition from elementary cooperatives (same below), and the labor utilization rate and attendance rate increased by 30% to 50%. Currently, many cooperatives are also starting to formulate agricultural technical operating procedures, and are determining the competition conditions for each production team, group, and member, launching a production increase competition within the cooperative, between teams, between groups, and between members.

    In order to improve the quality of advanced cooperatives and strengthen their leadership, the province has trained more than 100,000 people, including directors, deputy directors, and production team leaders of advanced cooperatives. Each special district and county has also dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside, adopting the method of summarizing and promoting experience from selected points to guide the whole area, to help solve various difficulties and problems of advanced cooperatives.

    山西省全面整顿农业合作社
    山西省新建的16，500多个高级农业生产合作社，已经全面进入整顿巩固阶段。
    这些高级社的整顿工作，一般是按照思想教育和制定生产规划、整顿劳动组织和建立管理机构以及处理生产资料公有化问题三个步骤结合进行的。现在，全省所有的高级社都建立了社的管理机构，并且按照并社、转社以后社员户数增多、经营范围扩大等新的情况，对原有的社务干部作了适当的调整和安排，加强了生产队、组等基层生产单位的领导，还在领导成分中树立了贫农、下中农的优势。
    全省所有新建的高级社，都已经定出了今年的增产计划，有些社还定出了7年到12年的长期农业发展规划。全省并且有80％的社已经完成或正在处理对社员私有土地、耕畜、农具等主要生产资料的公有化问题。这些高级社经过划分耕作区和生产队、逐步推行定额管理和按件计酬制度以后，很快提高了社员们的劳动生产率。一般的劳动效率比转社前的初级社同期（下同）提高20％到30％，劳动利用率和出勤率提高30％到50％。目前，很多社又在着手制定农业技术操作规程，并且正在确定各个生产队、组、社员的竞赛条件，发动开展社内队和队、组和组、社员和社员的增产竞赛。
    为了提高高级社的质量，加强高级社的领导，全省已经训练了高级社主任、副主任、生产队长等10万多人。各专区、县也派出大批干部下乡，采用以点带面总结和推广经验的方法，帮助解决高级社的各种困难问题。　（新华社）
