    Hydropower Station Brings Happiness
    To the Editor:
    Under the principle of "people-run with government assistance," Daqiao and Xinglong villages in Dunhua County, Jilin Province, have built a small hydropower station. When this hydropower station began supplying electricity on December 1, 1955, the farmers in these two villages felt extremely jubilant. Some farmers happily said: The road to socialism is getting closer!
    After the hydropower station was completed, Daqiao Village is planning to establish an electric pumping station to solve the irrigation problem for 70 hectares of paddy fields belonging to the village's six agricultural cooperatives. They also plan to install tap water pipes throughout the village. Daqiao and Xinglong villages jointly purchased a 7.5-horsepower electric motor and a flour milling machine, which can process and supply rice and flour for 2,000 people. In addition, 12 agricultural cooperatives plan to install 6 electric chaff cutters, each of which can cut 500 jin of grass per hour, saving manpower and freeing up a large number of livestock for other farm work. Since the Zhixin Agricultural Production Cooperative has had the power station, they can thresh grain under electric lights at night.
    The completion of the hydropower station has also promoted the cultural life of the two villages. The spare-time school is more active, and the number of students participating in learning in Daqiao Village has doubled compared to last year. In the Zhixin Agricultural Cooperative's club, people are constantly reading books and newspapers every night.

    水力发电站带来了幸福
    编辑同志：
    吉林省敦化县大桥、兴隆两个村，在“民办公助”方针下修建了一个小型水力发电站。当这个水电站在1955年12月1日开始送电的时候，这两个村的农民都感到无比的欢欣鼓舞。有的农民高兴地说：到社会主义的路更近了！
    在水电站建成以后，大桥村正在计划设立一个电力抽水机站，为村里6个农业社70垧水田解决灌溉问题。还准备在全村各处安置自来水管。大桥、兴隆两个村合资买了7.5马力的电动机和磨面机各一台，可以加工供应2，000人吃的米和面。另外有12个农业社计划安装6台电动铡草机，每台每小时可以铡草500斤，这样既节省了人力，又可以抽出大批畜力来作其他农活。智信农业生产合作社自从有了电站以后，晚上就可以在电灯光下打场了。
    水电站的建成还推动了两个村的文化生活。业余学校办得更活跃起来了，大桥村参加学习的学员比去年增加了一倍。智信农业社的俱乐部里，每天晚上看书看报的人总不间断。
