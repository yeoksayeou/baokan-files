Develop Camellia Production and Green Barren Mountains
	Wang Liangyou

	Zhejiang Province has proposed the task of vigorously developing camellia production in its mountainous area production plan.

	Camellia seeds can be used to make camellia oil. Camellia oil is a very good cooking oil and can also be refined into machine oil, such as lubricating oil, rust-preventive oil, etc. It can also be refined into petroleum jelly, skin cream, hair oil, and soaps. Camellia oil, like Zhejiang's tea, silk and other local specialties, is also an important export commodity. Exporting 1 ton of camellia oil can exchange for about 4 tons of steel or 5 tons of fertilizer.

	Camellia is one of the major oil crops in Zhejiang Province. The province originally had about 950,000 mu of camellia area, distributed in 48 counties. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the annual output of camellia seeds in the province reached more than 610,000 dan.

	In the major camellia-producing areas, camellia income is one of the main incomes of farmers. In Fangcun District, Changshan County, more than 80% of the 7,171 households produced camellia. In 1954, the district produced more than 8 million jin of rice and 1 million jin of camellia oil. The value of camellia oil and camellia cake totaled 7.5 million jin of rice, almost equal to the total value of rice. Zhangcun District of Qingtian County produced more than 500,000 jin of camellia oil in 1954, accounting for 40% of the district's agricultural income.

	Due to the long-term devastation of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, when the country was first liberated, more than 70% of the original camellia in Zhejiang Province (a total of more than 660,000 mu) was in a barren or semi-barren state. Since liberation, although there has been some restoration and development, the total output of camellia seeds has only reached 85% of that before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the average yield of camellia seeds per mu can only produce 12 jin and 13 liang of oil. In 1954, Zhejiang Province's total output of self-produced animal and vegetable oils could only supply more than 80% of the province's cooking oil supply, and the rest needed to be transferred from other provinces.

	Zhejiang Province has many mountainous areas (with about 60 million mu of barren mountains). Expanding the planting area of camellia can avoid competing with grain and cotton for land. The soil is fertile, the climate is mild, and the rainfall is abundant, all of which are suitable for the growth of camellia. Many mountain farmers also have experience in planting camellia. There is great potential for developing camellia production. At present, the output of the original camellia forests varies greatly, and the average oil yield per mu is less than 13 jin. However, according to typical investigations in various places, as long as the barren and semi-barren camellia forests are cultivated through mountain clearing and weeding, the yield can be increased in the second year, and the yield after the third year can be increased by 5 to 10 times. A farmer named Yan Jinfu in Changshan County used to harvest only 6 dan of camellia seeds every year when he did not manage the camellia. After clearing the mountain once in 1951, he harvested 35 dan in the third year, an increase of more than 4 times. Therefore, restoring the original barren and semi-barren camellia forests is the most effective way for Zhejiang Province to increase oil production. Of course, in order to meet the growing needs of the country and the people, new camellia forest land should be developed in large quantities in a planned way.

	The characteristics of camellia production are that it requires a lot of labor, large investment, and no income in the current year. Individual farmers have many difficulties in camellia production; while agricultural production cooperatives can overcome the difficulties that individual farmers cannot overcome. In recent months, a large number of agricultural and forestry production cooperatives have been developed in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang Province. These cooperatives will play a huge role in developing mountainous areas, developing diversified economies, especially in camellia production. In the more than 350,000 mu of camellia forests restored and developed in the spring of 1955, agricultural production cooperatives accounted for more than 80%. With the development of the cooperative movement, the province plans to develop 1 million mu of camellia and restore 280,000 mu of camellia in 1956.

	Now, Zhejiang Province has included the large-scale development of camellia production in the preliminary plan to eliminate barren mountains and green the province in 7 years, requiring the camellia area to be expanded to 5.85 million mu by 1958. If this plan is completed, 10 years later, in addition to achieving self-sufficiency in cooking oil within the province, the surplus camellia oil can also be supplied to other regions and industrial departments.

    发展油茶生产，绿化荒山
    王良佑
    浙江省在山区生产规划中，提出了大力发展油茶生产的任务。
    油茶籽可以做茶油。茶油是一种很好的食油，也可以炼制成机械油，如滑润油、防锈油等，还可以炼制凡士林、润面油、生发油和香皂等。茶油和浙江省出产的茶叶、丝绸等土特产品一样，也是重要的出口物资之一。输出1吨茶油，大约可以换回4吨钢材或5吨肥田粉。
    油茶是浙江省主要油料作物之一。全省原有油茶面积约95万亩，分布在48个县。抗日战争以前，全省油茶籽的年产量达到61万多担。
    在主要油茶产区，油茶的收入是农民的主要收入之一。常山县芳村区的7，171户农户中，生产油茶的农户就占80％以上，1954年全区产稻谷800多万斤，茶油产量达到100万斤，茶油和茶饼共值稻谷750万斤，几乎等于水稻的总值。青田县的章村区1954年产茶油50多万斤，占全区农业收入的40％。
    由于国民党反动统治的长期摧残，刚解放的时候，浙江省原有油茶已经有70％以上（计有66万多亩）处在荒芜和半荒芜的状态。解放以来，虽有若干的恢复和发展，可是油茶籽的总产量只达到抗日战争前的85％，平均每亩所产的油茶籽也只能出油12斤13两。浙江省1954年全省自产动植物油只能供给本省食油供应量的80％以上，其余的需由外省调入。
    浙江省山地多（荒山有6，000万亩左右），扩大种植油茶面积可以不同粮棉争地；土质肥沃，气候温和，雨量充足，都适于油茶的生长。很多山区农民又都有种植油茶的经验。发展油茶生产的潜力很大。目前，原有油茶林的产量相差很大，平均每亩产油还不到13斤。但是据各地的典型调查，荒芜和半荒芜的油茶林，只要经过铲山和除草等培育工作，第二年就能增产，第三年后的产量就可以提高5倍到10倍。常山县有个叫严金富的农民，从前他对油茶没有管理的时候，每年只收油茶籽6担，1951年铲了一次山后，第三年就收了35担，增加了4倍以上。所以，恢复原有荒芜和半荒芜的油茶林，是浙江省增加油料产量的一项最有效的办法。当然，为了适应国家和人民日益增长的需要，还要有计划地大量开发新的油茶林地。
    油茶生产的特点是花工多、投资大、不能当年有收益。个体农民在油茶生产上有很多困难；而农业生产合作社就可以克服单干农民所不能克服的困难。浙江省山区最近几个月已经发展了大量的农林业生产合作社，这些合作社将在开发山区、发展多种经济、特别是在油茶生产中发挥巨大的作用。1955年春全省恢复和发展的35万多亩油茶林中，农业生产合作社的就占了80％以上。随着合作化运动的发展，全省1956年要发展油茶100万亩，恢复油茶28万亩。
    现在，浙江省已经把大量发展油茶生产列入在7年内消灭荒山绿化全省的初步规划，要求到1958年，油茶面积扩大到585万亩。如果完成这一计划，到10年以后，除了达到省内食油自给外，还可把多余的茶油供应其他地区和工业部门。
