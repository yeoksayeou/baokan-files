    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

    I was deeply moved by Premier Zhou's political report, Vice Chairman Guo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the upsurge of the socialist revolution, and the reports of other leaders. As a worker in the electric power industry, I firmly believe that the development of the electric power industry plays a leading role in the development of other national economic undertakings, and I am willing to contribute all my strength to the development of China's electric power industry. I also had illusions about the puppet government and worked for many years in the production and construction of the electric power industry operated by the puppet government. From my own experience, I deeply realized that only under the people's regime can the electric power industry truly serve the people and develop rapidly; under the rule of the reactionary regime, no matter how hard the electric power workers work, it is in vain. In 1943, I participated in the industrial construction planning meeting convened by the puppet government, and jointly drafted preliminary opinions on the five-year and ten-year electric power development plans of our country with a number of electric power workers, and put forward opinions on the 20-year electric power development vision. At that time, the level of electric power development we proposed was: within 20 years, the national power generation capacity would reach half of the then US national power generation capacity of 40 million kilowatts, that is, 20 million kilowatts (China's national power generation capacity in 1936 was only 1.15 million kilowatts). This figure represents the opinions of many electric power workers at that time on the power generation capacity required for national industrialization. However, under the political situation at that time, even the most optimistic electric power workers believed that this was an unattainable fantasy. The puppet government convened this meeting merely to decorate the facade and did not truly care about the country's economic construction.

    After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, China's electric power workers repaired and reorganized the old equipment, expanded and built many thermal power plants, hydropower plants, and transmission lines. By the end of 1955, not only had the power generation capacity greatly increased compared with the past, but also the utilization rate and efficiency of the equipment had also greatly improved. For example, in 1955, the equipment utilization rate increased by more than doubled compared with 1949, and the coal consumption rate per kilowatt-hour was reduced by about one-third. Based on the speed of electric power development achieved in the past 6 years and the increasingly higher speed that will certainly occur in the future, I fully believe that the level of development of China's electric power industry will surely far exceed the most optimistic hopes of our electric power workers before liberation within 20 years. This bright prospect makes our electric power workers infinitely excited.

    After liberation, under the care and education of the Party and the government, with the help of Soviet experts, and with the unity and close cooperation of the worker comrades, the political and professional levels of the electric power technicians have been greatly improved, and the team has also been greatly expanded. However, many technicians, including myself, have not been able to exert their greatest strength. I think the most important reason is that our sense of being masters of our own affairs is not strong enough, our working methods are not correct, and our political theory level is not high enough. I personally deeply realize that if technicians do not study Marxism-Leninism theory well, it is impossible to combine technology and politics well in their work, and it is impossible to combine the advanced Soviet experience with China's specific conditions well in learning from the Soviet experience, and therefore it is impossible to correctly solve technical problems. Many of our electric power technicians often study problems in isolation, incompletely, and holistically. They often only see the electric power industry itself and cannot see the overall national construction cause. They only see the current needs and do not take into account the long-term development. When encountering complex problems, they often lack the ability to analyze contradictions and solve contradictions, so they cannot distinguish between major and minor, and cannot distinguish between priorities, and of course they cannot make correct technical decisions. I realize that for us technicians, striving to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is indeed a necessary condition for doing a good job.

    The Party and the government have put forward the task of catching up with the world's advanced scientific level in 12 years. Our engineering and technical personnel have a clear goal to strive for, and we must take on this glorious task. Before liberation, under the imperialist aggression, the destruction of the reactionary government, and the manipulation of bureaucratic capital, the technical level of China's electric power industry was very low. The voltage frequency specifications were chaotic, the equipment was old, and the power generation efficiency was very low. After liberation, China's electric power technology has made great progress in manufacturing, operation, maintenance, design, and construction. The first 400-kilometer, 220,000-volt transmission line designed and constructed domestically has been successfully put into operation. The Guanting Hydropower Station, which was designed and built domestically with domestically manufactured equipment, has been completed and is generating electricity. The first thermal power plant designed and built domestically with domestically manufactured equipment will soon be generating electricity. The new-style power plants with high pressure and high temperature of 100 atmospheres built with the help of the Soviet Union and new democratic countries have also been put into operation one after another. However, the technical level of our electric power industry is still far behind the level of the Soviet Union and other countries with advanced electric power industries. Nuclear power plants, power plants with pressures exceeding 300 atmospheres, 250,000-kilowatt turbine generator sets, 400,000-volt transmission lines, nuclear power plants, and fully automated and remotely controlled hydropower and thermal power plants are all achievements already obtained in the world's electric power industry. Power plants with 350 atmospheres and turbine generator sets with a capacity of about 300,000 kilowatts are under construction, and alternating current and direct current transmission lines with higher voltages will soon be realized. The world's electric power technology is advancing by leaps and bounds. The task of catching up with the world's advanced level in 12 years is indeed a very arduous task for the electric power industry. However, under China's superior economic system, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the support of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and with the tense labor of all electric power workers, China's technological and scientific progress will not be gradual but will advance in a leap forward manner. I believe that our electric power workers will be able to successfully complete the tasks given to us by the Party and the government. Finally, I express my determination to follow the instructions of Premier Zhou and Vice Chairman Guo, work actively under the leadership of the Party, thoroughly carry out self-transformation, study Marxism-Leninism and advanced Soviet technology well, and demand myself according to the standards of a Communist Party member. In the great march towards science, I must be a loyal soldier and strive to develop the science and technology of China's electric power industry.

    鲍国宝的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听到了周总理的政治报告，郭副主席的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告及其他首长的报告，非常感动。我是一个电力事业工作者，深信电业的发展对于其它国民经济事业的发展起着先行的作用，愿意贡献一切力量为我国电业的发展奋斗。我对于伪政府也曾存在过幻想，曾在伪政府所经营的电业的生产及建设方面做过多年工作。我从自己的经验深深体会到，只有在人民政权下，电业才能真正为人民服务，才能迅速地发展；在反动政权统治下，无论电业工作者如何努力，还是徒劳无功。我曾在1943年参加过伪政府召集的工业建设计划会议，和若干电业工作者共同草拟我国五年及十年电业发展计划的初步意见，并提出20年电业发展远景的意见。当时我们所提出的电业发展水平是：在20年内，全国发电容量达到其时美国全国发电容量4，000万千瓦的一半，即达到2，000万千瓦（我国全国发电容量在1936年只有115万千瓦）。这个数字，代表当时许多电业工作者对于全国工业化所需要发电容量的意见。但在当时的政治情况下，即使最乐观的电业工作者，也认为这是决不能达到的空想。伪政府召集这个会议，无非是点缀门面，并非真正关心国家的经济建设。
    解放后在党和政府正确的领导下，我国电业工作人员修复了并整理了旧有设备，扩建了并新建了很多的火力、水力发电厂及输电线路。到1955年底，非但发电容量较以前大大增加，即设备的利用率及效率，也有很大的提高。例如1955年，设备利用率比1949年增加一倍以上，每度电煤耗率减低了约三分之一。根据过去6年中电业发展已达到的速度及今后一定会有的越来越高的速度，我完全相信我国电业的发展水平，在20年内，必定远远超过解放前我们电业工作者最乐观的希望。这个光明的远景，使我们电业工作者无限地兴奋。
    在解放后，在党和政府的关怀和教育下，在苏联专家的帮助下，在工人同志的团结和密切合作下，电业技术人员在政治及业务水平方面都有了很大的提高，队伍也有很大的扩充。但是很多的技术人员，包括我在内，还没有能够发挥最大的力量。我认为最主要的原因，是我们的主人翁态度不够强，工作方法不正确，政治理论水平不够高。我个人深刻体会到，技术人员如果不很好地学习马克思列宁主义理论，就不可能在工作中使技术与政治很好地结合，就不可能在学习苏联经验中使苏联先进经验和我国的具体情况很好地结合，因而也就不可能正确地解决技术问题。我们许多电业技术人员，往往孤立地、不能全面地、整体地研究问题。往往只看电业本身，看不到国家建设事业的全面。只看到目前的需要，顾不到远景的发展。当遇到复杂的问题时，往往缺乏分析矛盾，解决矛盾的能力，因而分不出主要和次要，分不出轻重缓急，当然也就做不出正确的技术决定。我体会到，对于我们技术人员来说，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，确是做好工作的必要条件。
    党和政府已提出要在12年内赶上世界科学先进水平的任务。我们工程技术人员已有了明确的奋斗目标，我们一定要把这个光荣的任务担负起来。在解放前，我国电业在帝国主义侵略下，在反动政府的摧残下，在官僚资本的操纵下，技术水平是很低的。电压周波规格混乱，设备陈旧，发电效率甚低。解放后，我国电业技术无论在制造、运行、检修、设计、施工各方面，都有很大的进步。第一次国内设计、自己施工的400公里、22万伏输电线路，已成功地运行了。第一次国内制造设备、自己设计的官厅水力发电厂，已经建成发电了。第一次国内制造设备、自己设计的火力发电厂，不久也要发电了。苏联及新民主主义国家帮助我国建设的100大气压高压、高温的新式发电厂，也相继投入运行了。但是我们电业的技术水平，还是远远落后于苏联及其它电业先进国家的水平。原子能发电厂，超过300大气压高压的发电厂，25万千瓦容量的汽轮发电机组，40万伏输电线路，原子能发电厂，完全自动化、远距离操纵的水力、火力发电厂，这都是世界电业上已获得的成就。350大气压发电厂及约30万千瓦容量的汽轮发电机组正在建设中，更高电压的交流及直流输电线路，不久也要实现。世界的电业技术正在突飞猛进中。在12年内赶上世界先进水平的任务，对电业来讲，确是一项很艰巨的任务。但在我国优越的经济制度下，在党和毛主席英明的领导下，在苏联和新民主主义国家的支持下，在全体电业工作人员紧张的劳动下，我国的技术科学进步，将不是循序渐进而是以跃进的方式前进的。党和政府给予我们的任务，我相信我们电业工作者一定能够胜利地完成。最后，我表示决心遵照周总理和郭副主席的训示，在党的领导下，积极工作，彻底进行自我改造，好好学习马克思列宁主义及苏联先进技术，要以共产党员的标准来要求自己。在向科学的大进军中，我一定要做一名忠实的战士，为发展我国电业的科学技术而奋斗。
