Chen Chonggui's Speech
Chairman, fellow committee members:

I listened to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, "Summarizing the Experience of Socialist Transformation," which made me see "the prosperity of the great motherland" and "our people are advancing by leaps and bounds on the road of socialism." I was deeply moved, and I fully endorse his report. Subsequently, I have listened to reports on the issue of intellectuals, the issue of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and the issue of eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionaries, and I fully agree with them as well.

From the perspective of a 70-year-old Christian believer in Jesus, looking at the victory and progress of our country's socialist transformation, I particularly pay attention to and appreciate the changes in social morals and customs, and the progress in social ethics and discipline. All my life I have preached Christianity, repentance, rebirth, and salvation, hoping to reform people's hearts and customs. But since liberation, I have personally witnessed and experienced that only by reforming the national system, from feudalism, imperialism, and capitalism to socialism, can we thoroughly and extensively reform people's hearts and customs, and raise social moral standards.

Recently, as a member of the CPPCC, I inspected my hometown of Wuhan, where I grew up, and Changsha, where I worked for many years. To investigate social customs, morals, and discipline, I visited the local public security bureau chiefs and street residents, and I also inspected the prisons. Now I will report the results.

First, in Wuhan and Changsha, there are no prostitutes anymore, not even clandestine ones. The prostitutes left over from the old society have been taken into "New Life Education Centers" to treat their diseases, educate them to learn productive skills, and study ideological transformation. In Wuhan, 150 of them have already gotten married, 38 have been employed, and some have become activists and model workers, while 49 have returned to their hometowns to engage in production.

Second, thieves have disappeared because people's lives have improved, the masses' awareness has increased, and residents will report any thieves they discover. The household registration work is becoming increasingly strict, making it difficult for professional thieves to exist. Wuhan and Changsha have now achieved a state where doors are not locked at night.

Third, there are no more opium smokers. Because the country does not plant opium, it does not grow, does not buy, and does not sell, naturally no one smokes opium.

Fourth, the gambling atmosphere has also changed. There are no casinos at all, and gamblers who made a living from gambling have also been reformed. The former fashion of playing mahjong has also completely changed.

Fifth, pornographic books and paintings have also been banned from circulation. The masses' awareness has increased, and they oppose obscene books and paintings. The government has also issued explicit bans. Now, what is commonly circulated among the masses are new books and new pictures that promote patriotism and encourage production enthusiasm.

Sixth, how is social security? Answer: Completely peaceful. People live and work in peace and contentment. Residents' committees are organized everywhere to handle matters related to residents' public welfare, reflect residents' opinions and demands, mobilize residents to respond to the government's call, abide by laws and regulations, and lead mass security and defense work. A spirit of unity, friendship, mutual concession, and mutual assistance has been cultivated.

Seventh, in today's society, no one starves or freezes to death. Nor is it possible. Residents with living difficulties always receive relief; the unemployed and disabled always have solutions, and no one is allowed to starve or freeze to death. Because no one in society can be said to be uncared for or unattended to.

Eighth, there are no beggars either. Because there are production and education centers to accommodate them. They are required to work and produce, and the disabled, elderly, and weak who cannot work and produce are also provided with considerable support. Young children have orphanages, and the elderly have nursing homes.

Ninth, social order is very good. The general masses' political awareness has increased, and they more or less know how to talk about public morality, love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and protect public property. Traffic order is also very good. Dock workers do not engage in extortion or deception. Now, a spirit of serving the people and a style of people's democracy are prevailing. Righteousness is rising, evil is declining, and the overall atmosphere of the country has changed.

Finally, let me report a few words about the situation in our country's prisons. Wuhan has only one prison, with more than 2,000 prisoners, including about 300 female prisoners. The prisoners are almost all counter-revolutionaries. There are very few other criminal offenders, only one case of a man killing a woman and one case of a woman killing a man. When you walk into the prison, you can't tell it's a prison. No one is wearing shackles. Everyone is busy working; it's simply a factory. In Wuhan, it's a large-scale printing factory. When I saw it, they were printing textbooks for the Xinhua Bookstore. There are also uniform factories and auto repair shops. In Changsha, there isn't even a prison sign on the prison gate. Going inside, it's completely a match factory. Four or five hundred people are busy using machines to make matches. Their faces and expressions don't look like prisoners either. Everyone works enthusiastically and engages in labor competitions. As for visiting their dormitories, cafeterias, auditoriums, and gardens, they are all clean and tidy. They rest on Sundays, and they have various recreational activities in their spare time. When I visited in Wuhan, they were preparing to perform the Beijing opera "Qin Xianglian." I said to the prison director that most of these prisoners, even at home, probably don't have such comfortable living, food, and clothing as they do in prison. The prison director said: "That's right. Many prisoners are unwilling to go home when their sentences are up. Some go out and then come back, begging to be taken in to work." What I admire most is that the management comrades treat the prisoners with respect for their freedom of religious belief, and they are not allowed to hit, scold, or get angry, but only patiently persuade them and conduct patriotic education, with the aim of curing illnesses and saving people. Many, many of these counter-revolutionaries, after sitting in prison for some time, one year, two years, three years, or five years, learn politics and current affairs, and thus become aware, repent, receive lenient treatment, and are released to freedom.

All the victories, reforms, and progress mentioned above are due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, even an old man like me cannot help but be moved and cannot but support the Chinese Communist Party and love Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart.

    陈崇桂的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我听了周恩来主席的政治报告，“总结社会主义改造的经验”，使我看到“伟大祖国的兴盛”，“我国人民正在社会主义道路上大踏步地前进”，我大受感动，我完全拥护他的报告。其后我已听了关于知识分子问题的报告，关于资本主义工商业社会主义的改造问题的报告，关于肃清一切暗藏反革命分子问题的报告，我也完全同意。
    从一个70多岁的基督耶稣信徒的眼光，来看我国社会主义改造的胜利和进步，我特别注意而欣赏的是社会人心风俗的改变，社会风化风纪的进步。我一生传耶稣基督教，讲悔改、重生、得救，就是想改革人心和风俗。但是解放以来，我亲眼看见，亲身体会，只有改革国家制度，从封建主义，帝国主义，资本主义制度，到社会主义制度，才能彻底的，大量的改革人心和风俗，才能提高社会的道德标准。
    近来我曾以政协委员的资格，视察了我生长大的故乡武汉，和我多年工作所在地长沙。为查考社会的风俗人心，道德纪律，我拜访了当地公安局长和街道居民，我也视察了监狱，今将所得的结果，报告一下。
    第一，在武汉和长沙，没有娼妓了，连暗娼也没有了，已将旧社会遗留下的妓女们，收容到“新生教养院”治疗她们的疾病，教育她们学会生产本领，学习思想改造。在武汉，其中150人已经结婚了，劳动就业的有38人，内中有人做了积极分子和劳动模范，回乡生产的49人。
    第二，盗贼绝迹了，因为人民生活改善了，群众觉悟提高了，居民中发现盗贼一定检举，户籍工作日渐严密，职业盗贼难以存在。现在武汉市、长沙市已经做到夜不闭户。
    第三，没有吸鸦片的人了。因为全国不种植鸦片，不生不长，不买不卖，自然也没有人吃鸦片烟了。
    第四，赌博的风气也改变了，根本没有赌场，靠赌博为生的赌棍也得到了改造，从前打麻将的风气也完全改变了。
    第五，黄色书画也被禁止流行了，群众觉悟提高了，反对淫书淫画。政府也明令取缔。现在普遍流传在群众中间的是提倡爱国，鼓励生产积极性的新书，新图画。
    第六，社会治安如何？答：完全安静，人民安居乐业，各处组织居民委员会，办理有关居民公共福利，反映居民的意见和要求，动员居民响应政府的号召，遵守法令，领导群众性治安和保卫工作，调解居民的争端和纠纷已经养成了一种大家团结、友爱、相让、互助的风气。
    第七，今日社会中，没有饿死冻死的人。也不可能有。居民中有生活困难的，总有救济；失业的、残废的总有办法，绝不让一个人饿死冻死。因为社会中没有一个人可说是无人过问，无人照顾。
    第八，乞丐也没有了。因为有生产教养院收容他们。要他们劳动生产，残废老弱不能劳动生产的。也受到相当的供养，幼小的有孤儿院，老迈的有养老院。
    第九，社会的秩序非常好，一般的群众政治觉悟提高了，或多或少知道讲公德，知道爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物。交通秩序也非常好，码头工人没有敲诈欺骗的事，现在风行一种为人民服务的风气，一种人民民主的作风。正气上升，邪气下降，全国整个的风气改变了。
    末了让我报告几句我国监狱的情况，武汉只一个监狱，有监犯2.000多人，内女犯约300人。犯人几乎都是反革命分子。很少其他刑事犯，只有一个男杀女，一个女杀男的案子。你走进监狱去看，看不出来是个监狱，没有一个带刑具的人，人人都在忙碌工作，简直是个工厂。在武汉是个大规模的印刷厂，我看的时候，他们正在印新华书店的教科书；此处还有制服厂、汽车修理厂。在长沙监狱大门上连一个监狱招牌也没有，进去看完全是个火柴厂，四、五百人忙着用机器制造火柴。他们面貌表情上也不像囚犯，人人热情地工作。并且劳动竞赛。至于参观他们的宿舍，食堂，大礼堂，花园，皆是干干净净整整齐齐，他们礼拜天休息，业余有各种文娱活动，在武汉我参观的时候，他们正预备演京戏秦香莲。我对监狱长说，这些犯人，大半在家里，怕未必有在监狱里这样舒适的起居、饮食、衣服。狱长说：是的，许多犯人刑期满了，不肯回家去，有的出去了又转来，哀求收纳他们工作。最叫我钦佩的是管理同志们，对待犯人，也尊重他们的宗教信仰自由，更不许打，不许骂，不许发怒，只能耐心说服，进行爱国教育，目的是治病救人。这些反革命分子，坐监一些时候，一年两年，三年五年，学习政治，时事，因而觉悟，悔改，得到宽大处理，得释放自由的人很多很多。
    以上所说的一切胜利，改革，进步，皆是由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，因此连我这个老朽也不能不受感动，不能不从心底深处拥护中国共产党，热爱毛主席。
