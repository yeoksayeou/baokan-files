Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, dispatch: According to delayed news from Laos: Prince Souphanouvong, representing the Lao Fighting Units, wrote to the Chairman of the International Commission for Laos on January 15, raising the issue of implementing the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning general elections in Laos.

The letter stated that the unilateral election organized by the Lao Royal Government in 10 provinces on December 25, 1955, was not the universal suffrage stipulated in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, in which the Lao Fighting Units, former resistance personnel, and all citizens participated. The letter pointed out that Article 3 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference has not been fulfilled.

Souphanouvong mentioned in the letter that the list announced by the Lao Royal Government of those elected in the unilateral election included two representatives from Sam Neua Province and two representatives from Phongsaly Province, pointing out that this was inconsistent with the actual situation and was an action that disregarded the Geneva Accords. Souphanouvong said that no elections had been held in the regroupment areas of the Lao Fighting Units, Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces, and that it was only the Lao Royal Army forcing a small number of people to vote in individual strongholds they occupied.

Souphanouvong concluded by saying, "In the name of the representative of the Lao Fighting Units, I firmly oppose the aforementioned actions of the Royal Government and request the International Commission to pay attention to the aforementioned events so that the provisions of the Geneva Accords are respected."

    寮方就普选问题致函老挝国际委员会
    新华社河内电　据老挝迟到消息：苏发努冯亲王在1月15日代表寮国战斗部队写信给老挝国际委员会主席，提出了关于实行日内瓦协定有关老挝普选问题的条款问题。
    信中说，1955年12月25日老挝王国政府在10个省内组织的片面选举，它并不是日内瓦会议最后宣言所规定的有寮国战斗部队、前抗战人员和全体公民参加的普选。信中指出，日内瓦会议最后宣言第三条一直没有得到履行。
    苏发努冯在信中提到老挝王国政府所公布的在片面选举当选的名单中竟有桑怒省的两名代表和丰沙里省的两名代表时，指出这是不符合实际情况的，并且是无视日内瓦协定的行动。苏发努冯说，在寮国战斗部队集结区桑怒和丰沙里两省并没有举行过选举，这只是老挝王国军队在他们所占领的个别据点里强迫少数人去投票而已。
    苏发努冯最后说，我以寮国战斗部队代表的名义，坚决反对王国政府的上述行动，并且要求国际委员会注意上述事件，使日内瓦协定的各项条款得到尊重。
