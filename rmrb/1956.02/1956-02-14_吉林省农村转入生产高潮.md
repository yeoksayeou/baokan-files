Jilin Province's Rural Areas Enter a Production Upsurge
The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial rural work conference from February 2nd to 9th. The conference determined that the entire province should concentrate its efforts on leading farmers from the high tide of cooperation to a high tide of production.

The conference proposed launching a large-scale agricultural production technology reform movement throughout the province, striving to overfulfill the task of increasing grain production by 6.6 million tons this year, and completing the 1957 grain production increase target ahead of schedule. To this end, the conference pointed out that all regions must concentrate their efforts, focusing on spring plowing and production, to consolidate and improve the quality of agricultural production cooperatives, help cooperatives establish and improve production management systems, and further inspect and raise the necessary seeds, fodder, manure, fertilizer, and production funds for spring plowing and production, so as to increase this year's yield per unit area.

    吉林省农村转入生产高潮
    中共吉林省委在2月2日到9日召开了全省农村工作会议。会议确定：全省当前要集中力量，领导农民从合作化高潮转入生产高潮。
    会议提出了要在全省开展一个大规模的农业生产技术改革运动，争取在今年超额完成生产粮食660万吨的增产任务，提前完成1957年的粮食增产指标。为此，会议指出了各地必须集中力量，以春耕生产为中心，整顿和提高农业生产合作社的质量，帮助合作社建立和健全生产管理制度，进一步检查和筹集春耕生产所需要的籽种、草料、粪肥和生产资金等，以提高今年的单位面积产量。
