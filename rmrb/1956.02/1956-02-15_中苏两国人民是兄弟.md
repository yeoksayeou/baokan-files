Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He

Those who live by the sea are familiar with the rising tide, which can be observed at every moment. I have the good fortune to live in the Soviet Union for several years continuously, and I have personally witnessed the friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people, like a rising tide, each wave surpassing the last at every moment.

The political, economic, cultural ties, and cooperation between our two countries are becoming closer day by day. Civil aviation flights have changed from several round trips a week to one round trip every day. Kozhedub, who has been awarded the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union" three times, has already predicted that supersonic aircraft will soon be flying between Moscow and Beijing. The number of visiting delegations is increasing day by day. The enthusiasm of the Soviet people for the Chinese people has developed from the revelry of friends meeting for the first time to the intimacy of close friends.

Deeper understanding and more concrete cooperation – these are the characteristics of the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

Deepening understanding can thicken friendship and strengthen cooperation. Newspapers and periodicals are an important bridge to promote mutual understanding. The amount of coverage on China in Soviet newspapers and periodicals is increasing year by year. Several years ago, they introduced China more during festivals, but now they report on China's important events and opinions on a daily basis. Now, the "People's Daily" and "Russian Friendship News" can be read in Moscow every two or three days. The "Russian Friendship News," which was only recently launched, already has 50,000 subscribers; the Russian version of "People's China" magazine has 40,000 subscribers. Those who care for their best friends will understand the Soviet people's desire to learn more about China's construction and people's lives.

Six years ago, the Soviet people warmly and excitedly celebrated the birth of the People's Republic of China in the East. Now, they are equally happy to see the Chinese people rapidly carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and they firmly believe that China will be built into a socialist society.

Among Soviet comrades, one often hears conversations like this: "Although China accepted less industrial 'heritage' than the Soviet Union did at the time of the October Revolution, China will build a socialist society faster than the Soviet Union did at that time."

Why? Because "the problem does not depend on the industrial 'heritage,' which is very little in both cases. Like the Soviet Union, China has the correct leadership of the Communist Party and a people who love labor and are the masters of the country. China has the experience and assistance of the Soviet Union, as well as the aid of the entire socialist camp. The Soviet Union did not have this at that time."

The upsurge of the socialist revolution in the countryside, which began in the second half of last year, has received great attention from the Soviet people. Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were published in full in "Pravda" and published as a large number of separate editions by the Soviet State Political Books Publishing House. Comrade Mao Zedong's "Preface to 'The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside'" was published in various Soviet newspapers, and this book is being translated. The "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was published in full in "Pravda."

After "Pravda" published Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," it received many letters and phone calls from readers requesting further materials to explain the meaning of China's semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives and fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives and the stages of their development, the issue of China's agricultural technology transformation, and concepts such as old middle peasants and new middle peasants. "The Chinese comrades are doing the right thing and doing it well." – This is the Soviet comrades' praise for China's socialist revolution in the countryside. Semyonov, the director of the Gorky State Farm in Moscow Oblast, was one of the 25,000 party workers sent to the countryside by the party during the period of the Soviet Union's overall collectivization in 1930. A few days ago, he said to me: "I like the high-speed development of your agricultural cooperation. Our style is the same." Poldashev, an engineer from the Komsomol member of the Moscow Hammer and Sickle Factory, told me about his thoughts on the upsurge of agricultural cooperation in China: "This is the correct path. Our people have tested this path."

The Soviet people, who have never relaxed the development of heavy industry, naturally care about the development of China's socialist industrialization. In steel joint factories, machine manufacturing plants, automobile manufacturing plants, chemical factories, oil mines, coal mines, and other enterprises, there is almost no place where one does not encounter matters related to China's industrialization. Employees are manufacturing machines and training technical personnel for China with great enthusiasm.

A new type of platen press designed and manufactured by the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant for China is nearing completion. It can press thin plates ranging from 1.8 to 50 millimeters thick and 1,000 to 2,500 millimeters wide. The productivity will be twice as high as the existing similar platen presses in the Soviet Union. Because it is made for China, the employees are particularly excited. They want to assemble the platen press and send it to China before the opening day of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, which is also the 6th anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance.

The Chelyabinsk Steel Joint Factory has trained a group of Chinese interns. They told me: "Thanks to the patient teaching of the Soviet comrades, we have mastered the production technology within a year." They learned step by step from the third assistant steelmaker to the second assistant, to the first assistant, and then to the foreman. Each intern is assigned a dedicated instructor. After learning to a certain stage, the instructor conducts a test. The chief engineer regularly checks the learning progress. All the production experience and technology that Chinese interns need to know are selflessly taught by Soviet comrades.

The director's office of the Pervouralsk New Steel Pipe Factory houses a precious gift: a letter from all the employees of the Anshan Seamless Steel Pipe Factory to all the employees of the New Steel Pipe Factory and a section of large-diameter steel pipe the height of a pen holder, with the Chinese characters "Crystallization of Sino-Soviet Friendship" engraved on the surface. Director Danilov showed me this gift and said excitedly: "This is the product of the first batch of Chinese interns." He is proud to have such apprentices.

These concrete examples remind me of what Comrade Khrushchev recently said in his report to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "We have the closest relationship with the great People's Republic of China. The people of our two countries are brothers."

The people of China and the Soviet Union are confidants and brothers. – This is the common thought of millions of people.

    中苏两国人民是兄弟
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    住在海边的人熟悉海水涨潮的情形，那是每时每刻可以观察到的。我有幸在苏联连续住好几年，亲眼看见苏联人民对中国人民的友谊正像那后浪赶过前浪的每时每刻上涨的海潮。
    我们中苏两国政治、经济、文化的联系和合作一天比一天密切。民航飞机从每周对开几次改为每日对开一次，获得三次“苏联英雄”称号的阔日杜布已经预言不久将来将有超音速的飞机航行在莫斯科和北京之间了。来往的代表团一天比一天多起来。苏联人民对中国人民的热情，已经从那种初次会面的朋友的狂欢发展为知心朋友的亲密了。
    更加深刻的了解，更加具体的合作，——这是中苏两国人民的深厚友谊的特征。
    加深了解，便能加厚友谊，加强合作。报刊是促进相互了解的一个重要桥梁。苏联报纸刊物介绍中国事情的分量一年比一年多了。几年以前它们在节日介绍中国较多，现在它们日常报道着中国的重要事情和言论。现在，“人民日报”和“俄文友好报”隔两三天在莫斯科就可以读到。才发行不久的“俄文友好报”已经有5万订户；俄文版“人民中国”杂志有4万订户。关怀自己最好的朋友的人，是会明白苏联人民渴望多了解中国建设和人民生活的心情的。
    6年以前，苏联人民热情和兴奋地欢呼中华人民共和国在东方的诞生，现在，他们同样高兴地看到中国人民迅速进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，并且深信不疑中国一定会建成社会主义社会。
    在苏联同志当中常常听见这样的谈话：“虽然中国接受的工业‘遗产’比苏联在十月革命时还少，但是中国建成社会主义社会要比苏联当时快。”
    为什么呢？因为“问题不决定于说来都是少得很的工业‘遗产’。中国和苏联一样有共产党的正确领导，有爱好劳动和当了国家主人的人民。中国有苏联的经验和帮助，还有整个社会主义阵营的援助。这是苏联当时没有的。”
    从去年下半年开始的农村的社会主义革命高潮，受到苏联人民重视。毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议，全文登载在“真理报”上，并且由苏联国家政治书籍出版社印成大量单行本发行。毛泽东同志所写的“‘中国农村的社会主义高潮’序言”，登载在苏联各个报纸上，这本书正被翻译着。中共中央提出的“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”，全文登载在“真理报”上。
    “真理报”在登载毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告以后，接到许多读者的来信和电话，要求继续发表材料，解释中国半社会主义的农业生产合作社和全社会主义的农业生产合作社的意义和它们发展的阶段，中国农业技术改造问题以及老中农新中农之类的概念。 “中国同志做得对，做得好。”——这是苏联同志对中国农村社会主义革命的赞语。莫斯科州高尔克国营农场场长谢孟诺夫是1930年苏联全盘集体化时期由党派到农村工作的25，000党员工人之一。前几天他对我说：“我喜欢你们农业合作化的高速度发展。我们的作风是一样的。”莫斯科镰刀和铁鎚工厂青年团员波尔达什夫工程师对我谈他对中国农业合作化高潮的感想说：“这是正确的路线。我国人民考验过这个路线。”
    从来没有放松发展重工业的苏联人民，对于中国社会主义工业化发展的关怀，是可想而知的。在钢铁联合工厂、机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、化学工厂、油矿、煤矿和其他企业，几乎没有一处不遇见关系我国工业化的事情。职工们以高度热情为中国制造着机器和培养着技术人材。
    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂为中国设计和制造的新式压板机快要完成了。它能压1.8到50公厘薄和1，000到2，500公厘宽的薄板。生产率将比苏联现有的同类压板机高一倍。因为是为中国制造的，职工们特别兴奋。他们要赶在苏共第二十次代表大会开幕日，也就是中苏友好同盟互助条约6周年的日子把压板机装配好和发送到中国去。
    车里雅宾斯克钢铁联合工厂培养了一批中国实习生。他们对我说：“感谢苏联同志的耐心教授，我们在一年以内掌握了生产技术。”他们从炼钢第三助手而第二助手，而第一助手，而工长，一级一级地学习。每个实习生都配备一个专门的指导员。学习到一个段落，由指导员举行测验。总工程师定期检查学习情况。凡是中国实习生需要知道的生产经验和技术，都得到苏联同志无私的传授。
    彼尔沃乌拉尔斯克新钢管工厂的厂长办公室里保存着珍贵的礼物，那是鞍山无缝钢管工厂全体职工送给新钢管工厂全体职工的一封信和一截笔筒高的大口径钢管，管面刻着“中苏友谊的结晶”几个汉字。厂长达尼洛夫给我看这个礼物，兴奋地说：“这是第一批中国实习生的产品。”他以有这样的徒弟自豪。
    这些具体的事例，使我记起赫鲁晓夫同志最近在苏联最高苏维埃会议上作的报告中说的话：“我们同伟大的中华人民共和国有最亲密的关系。我们两国人民是兄弟。”
    中苏两国人民是知己，是兄弟。——这是千千万万人们的共同的思想。
