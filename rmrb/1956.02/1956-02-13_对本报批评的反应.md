    Reaction to Criticism from This Newspaper
    On December 5, 1955, this newspaper published an article entitled "Why Can't Ping'an Mine Achieve Full-Mine Regular Cycle Operation?" criticizing the Fuxin Mining Bureau's Ping'an Mine for failing to effectively promote the advanced experience of regular cycle operation. Zhang Guanghua and Chen Haishan, deputy directors of Ping'an Mine, have written letters of self-criticism and proposed four measures, including earnestly changing leadership style and vigorously promoting advanced experience.

    对本报批评的反应
    1955年12月5日本报发表了“平安矿为什么不能全矿实现正规循环作业”一文，批评阜新矿务局平安矿没有很好推广正规循环作业的先进经验。平安矿副矿长张光华、陈海山已来信检讨，并提出了切实转变领导作风，大力推广先进经验等四项措施。
