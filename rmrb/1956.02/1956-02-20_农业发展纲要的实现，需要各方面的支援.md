    The Realization of the Agricultural Development Program Needs Support from All Sides
    Liao Shiguang

    "Once the National Agricultural Development Program is realized, we will see a domestic market with astonishing purchasing power." (Comrade Liao Luyan's explanation of the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956 to 1967) In fact, as this "Program" is beginning to be implemented, we can already see how much change our domestic market will undergo.

    To understand the new changes and demands in agricultural production cooperatives, both in terms of production and the lives of their members, we conducted focused investigations in Gaoshan Township (hilly area) in Changsha County, Hunan Province, and in Sutang Township and Wangjia Township (lake area) in Xiangyin County. The common characteristics of these regions are the farmers' high enthusiasm for forming cooperatives and for production, as well as the great potential for increasing agricultural and sideline production. Due to the development of agricultural production and the increase in sideline production, the demand for labor is increasing, but physical and manual labor have not decreased with the increase in workload. This situation has hindered the more rapid growth of agricultural and sideline production. Promoting double-cropping rice is an important measure to increase rice production; however, the promotion of double-cropping rice can only be carried out gradually at a relatively slow pace. Work on improving dry land, fishing, and land reclamation is either delayed, suspended, or reduced; one of the important reasons for this is the lack of labor, especially seasonal labor.

    Generally, agricultural production cooperatives first request the supply of various new agricultural tools. Given the current poor roads and the small and irregular fields, the requirements for new agricultural tools are: light and sturdy, easy to assemble and disassemble, suitable for paddy fields and suitable for the pulling power of water buffalo. Hilly areas require small, improved agricultural tools suitable for small hilly paddy fields, easy to turn, and easy to move up and down slopes. Larger cooperatives with more public funds also request small and light power tools and agricultural implements. These large cooperatives are most urgently requesting threshing machines. Because during the early rice harvest and late rice transplanting, the biggest labor demand in the fields is threshing. The Sutang Township Agricultural Cooperative requests threshing machines with an efficiency of threshing more than 2,000 catties of grain per person per day on average. Secondly, they request the supply of dryers. Last year, after the early rice was brought home, losses caused by germination were more than 30,000 catties based on the statistics of just one cooperative. Because at this time, there is not enough labor, and there is no way or place to dry it by wind; if there were dryers, the problem of grain sprouting could be solved.

    In the work of promoting double-cropping rice, water conservancy and fertilizer are also prominent issues. Double-cropping rice requires water for a long time. Currently, farmers in mountainous areas feel two hardships in water conservancy work: one is the hardship of pumping water in summer, and the other is the hardship of repairing ponds in winter. The hardship of pumping water in summer is that water pumping is often done in the hottest season, the water below is scalding hot, and the sun above is scorching, so many people suffer from heatstroke; the hardship of repairing ponds in winter is that it is very cold in the early winter mornings, and people are barefoot in the mud and water digging and carrying soil, walking up and down, their feet and legs cracking, and they ache from the cold and heat. Both of these jobs are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and cause people to suffer. They request pumps or sprinkler equipment that can spray water about 15 zhang away. The work of repairing ponds usually involves filling in small ponds to combine them into larger ones, or deepening and enlarging small ponds, which requires using a "rotating belt" to move soil and "small carts" to push mud.

    In terms of fertilizer, the policy of focusing on farm manure is easy to implement in the areas we saw (hilly and lake areas). However, the demand for commercial fertilizer does not decrease with the increase in farm manure: not only should the demand for lime (requesting lime to be transported in large quantities in a timely manner), bone meal (requesting bone meal to be finely ground and easy to ferment), and chemical fertilizer be increased, but also the supply of fertilizer with the same effectiveness as vegetable cake and sesame cake is requested.

    In mountainous areas, double-cropping rice is more susceptible to stem borers, and wheat also has smut disease. The lake area had fewer insects due to the major flood the year before last, but early prevention is still needed. All cooperatives universally request the supply of effective 666 powder. They say: With pesticides, the problem of diseases and insect pests can be solved.

    The use of improved agricultural tools must be combined with road repair and field leveling work. Otherwise, it will be difficult to realize the potential for increased production if all new agricultural tools have to adapt to narrow and winding field ridges and extremely small and irregular fields. New agricultural tools should not only adapt to the specific conditions of today's roads and fields but also promote road repair and field leveling. Road repair mainly involves three tasks: digging soil, carrying soil, and compacting; field leveling also mainly involves three tasks: scooping up fertile soil, leveling raw soil, and then pouring the fertile soil back on and harrowing it flat. If improved or new tools can replace manual labor, road repair and field leveling work can be completed sooner; if it relies entirely on manual labor, the amount of work required will be large, and the completion time will be delayed. Therefore, low-cost soil-shoveling tools, leveling tools, soil-pushing carts, and road-rolling tools are needed. Several cooperatives can buy them together and use them in rotation to promote the early start of road repair and field leveling work.

    As long as manpower can be saved in field labor, sideline production can be further developed. Hilly areas want to raise fish and plant trees, and the current problem to be solved is the supply of fish fry and tree seedlings, followed by the problem of sporadic purchases of pond fish (currently done by peddlers) and the elimination of tree pests, and the issue of supply and marketing cooperatives and other purchasing agencies signing contracts with agricultural cooperatives.

    After farmers join cooperatives, production increases, income increases, and they constantly make new demands in their lives. Last year's bumper harvest allowed the hilly and lake areas we saw to reach the level of eating their fill and having enough to wear, with the lake area being somewhat more prosperous than the mountainous area. In terms of clothing, the demands of young and middle-aged women are: "Clean and tidy when going out (referring to clothing), and beautiful when coming in (referring to bedding and mosquito nets)." The minimum requirement for ordinary farmers is to have clothes for receiving guests outside and clothes for changing with the seasons inside. The requirement for the quality of the cloth is that it should be strong and not fade.

    How to help farmers plan and design housing has become an urgent issue. Currently, each household in Gaoshan Township has an average of two to three rooms, and they live very scattered, with four or five or one or two families living every two or three li. Township staff, agricultural cooperative leaders, and farmers all feel that running the roads is too far and meetings are inconvenient. Since engaging in collective production and cultural and recreational activities after the establishment of cooperatives, there is an even greater demand for more concentrated living. Now, those who want to build houses are waiting for unified planning. The general requirements for new houses are: whitewashed inside, with glass windows, tiled roofs, and a loft on the ceiling (good for storing small furniture and supplies, like a small warehouse).

    Among daily necessities, flashlights and fountain pens are currently more commonly used, with almost every young person having one. With the development of culture and health, more enamelware, thermos bottles, pillowcases, bed sheets, etc. are needed. To meet the needs of collective activities, many clocks are needed.

    Young people are keen on learning culture and request the establishment of spare-time cultural schools, sports teams, theater groups, etc. They require larger chandeliers, various sports equipment, and more popular books and comic books with various knowledge. In terms of medical care, in addition to schistosomiasis being more serious, the most common are dysentery, measles, malaria, roundworms, summer heatstroke, boils and prickly heat in children, diphtheria, frostbite, trachoma, and other diseases. In the past, very few people sought medical treatment when they were sick, but now the masses urgently demand treatment for these diseases. Therefore, not only is it necessary for medicines to go to the countryside, but also the issues of medical personnel and health knowledge promotion need to be resolved.

    The vigorous development of the agricultural cooperative movement has brought about tremendous changes in the vast countryside, and the urgent demands that farmers have made on the various departments of the national economy in terms of production and life are concentrated reflections of these changes. All relevant departments should carefully study the demands of the farmers and try their best to satisfy them; so as to better promote the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country and promote the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program.

    农业发展纲要的实现，需要各方面的支援
    廖时光
    “全国农业发展纲要一旦实现了，我们就会看到一个拥有大得惊人的购买力的国内市场。”（廖鲁言同志关于1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要的说明）事实上，在这个“纲要”正在开始实行的时候，已经可以看到，我们的国内市场将要发生多大的变化。
    为了了解当前农业生产合作社在生产方面以及社员生活方面有些什么新的变化和要求，我们曾经在湖南省长沙县高山乡（丘陵区）和湘阴县粟塘乡、王家乡（湖区）进行了重点调查。上述地区的共同特点是农民办社热情和生产热情都很高，农业和副业的增产潜力都很大。由于农业生产的发展，副业生产的增加，劳动力的支付量越来越大，而体力劳动和手工劳动，并未因工作量的增加而减少，这种情况已经阻碍了农业和副业生产更迅速的增长。推广双季稻是水稻增产的重要措施之一；可是，双季稻的推广工作，只能以较缓的速度逐步推广。旱土改良田、打鱼、开荒等工作，有的缓办，有的暂停，有的少办；其重要原因之一，就是由于劳力不足，特别是季节性的劳力不足。
    一般的农业生产合作社，首先要求供应各种新式农具。在目前道路不好，田丘小而又不规则的情况下，对新式农具的要求是：轻便结实，易装易卸，适用于水田又适宜于水牛的拉力。丘陵地区则要求适用于小丘水田、调转方便，易上易下的小型改良农具。而公积金较多的大社，还提出要求小巧轻便的动力工具和农具。这些大社对打谷机要求最迫切。因为收早稻插晚稻的时候，田间劳动量最大的是打谷工作。粟塘乡农业合作社要求供应平均每人每天能打两千斤谷以上效率的打谷机。其次，要求供应烘干器。去年早谷到家后，因发芽造成损失的，仅1个社的统计就在3万斤以上。因为这时劳动力忙不过来，又无法、无地进行风干；如有烘干器，怕谷草发芽的问题就可以解决了。
    在推广双季稻的工作中，水利和肥料也是突出的问题。双季稻需水时间长。目前山区农民在水利工作中感到二苦：一是夏季车水苦，一是冬季修塘苦。夏季车水苦是说车水往往是最热的季节，下面水热得发烫，上面太阳烤人，因此中暑的人很多；冬季修塘苦是说初冬早上很冷，光着脚腿在泥水里刨土挑土，人上下走着，脚腿开裂，冷热都疼。这两种工作都是费时、费工、人吃苦。要求能有抽水机或能打15丈左右远的喷水器具。修塘工作一般是填去小的并成大的，或者将小塘加深加大，这里需要用“转动带”带土、用“小推车”推泥。
    在肥料方面，我们看到的地区（丘陵区和湖区）以农家肥料为主的方针是易于贯彻实行的。但是对商品肥料的要求，并不因农家肥料的增加而减少：不仅对石灰（要求石灰能及时大量运到）、骨粉（要求骨粉磨细、易发酵）、化学肥料的要求要增加，而且要求能有和菜饼麻饼肥效相同的肥料供应。
    在山区，双季稻受螟害较多，小麦也有黑穗病。湖区因前年大水虫少，但是也需要及早预防。各社普遍要求供应药效好的六六六粉。他们说：有了农药，病虫害问题就可以解决。
    要使用改良的农具工具，必须同修路整田工作结合。不然，要让全部新式农具都适应狭窄弯曲的田埂路和极小而又不规则的田丘，很难发挥增产潜力。新式农具一面要适应今天路和田的具体条件，也要对修路和整田起促进作用。修路主要是三种工作：挖土、挑土、捶紧；整田主要也是三种工作：铲起肥土、推平生土、再倒上肥土耙平。如果能有改良的或新式工具来代替人力劳动，修路、整田的工作就可以早日完成；如完全依靠人力，则需工量大，完成的时间也会推迟。因此，需要价值比较低廉的铲土工具、平土工具、推土小车、压路工具。可由几个社合买，轮流使用，以促使修路和整田工作早日开始。
    只要田间劳动能省出人力，就可以进一步开展副业生产。丘陵地区要养鱼、植树，目前要解决的是鱼苗、树秧的供应问题，以后是塘鱼零星收购问题（目前是小贩收）和消灭树木虫害问题，供销合作社及其他收购机构同农业合作社订合同问题。
    农民入社后，生产增加，收入增加，在生活方面也不断提出新的要求。去年丰收，我们看到的丘陵地区和湖区，都可以达到吃饱穿暖的水平，湖区较山区还要宽裕一些。穿的方面，青壮年妇女们的要求是：“走出去干净整齐（指穿的），走进来漂漂亮亮（指铺盖被帐）。”一般农民最低的要求是外面有做客的衣服，里面有换季的衣服。对布的质量的要求是要结实，不退色。
    如何帮助农民规划和设计住宅，已经成为一个迫切的问题。高山乡现在每户住房平均两间到三间，住得很分散，每相隔二、三里，居住四、五家或一、二家。各乡工作人员和农业合作社领导人员和农民群众深感跑路太远，开会不方便。由于建社后集体地从事生产和文化娱乐活动，更要求居住比较集中。现在想盖房子的都在等待统一的规划。对新屋的一般要求是：内部刷粉，有玻璃窗，上面盖瓦，顶棚有楼板（好放零星家具用品，像小仓库）。
    日用工业品，目前用得比较普遍的是手电筒、钢笔，青年人几乎每人有一只。随着文化卫生事业的发展，需要更多的搪瓷器皿、热水瓶，以及枕套、床单等等。为了适应集体活动的需要，需要许多时钟。
    青年人都热爱学习文化，要求能成立业余文化学校、球队、剧团等。要求有较大的吊灯，要求各种体育用品，要求增加各种知识的通俗图书、连环图画等等。在医疗方面，除血吸虫病较严重外，最普遍的是痢疾、麻疹、疟疾、蛔虫、夏季中暑、小孩生疮疖、长痱子、白喉、冻疮、砂眼等病。过去有病就医的人很少，现在群众迫切要求治疗这些疾病。因此，不仅需要药品下乡，还有医疗人员问题和卫生知识宣传问题需要解决。
    农业合作化运动的蓬勃开展，使广大农村发生了巨大的变化，农民在生产、生活上向国民经济各有关部门提出来的迫切要求，就集中地反映了这些变化。一切有关部门都应该认真地研究农民的要求，并且尽可能地使他们得到满足；从而更好地推动我国农业社会主义改造事业，促进全国农业发展纲要的实现。
