Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 6th: The Bulgarian newspapers published Bulgarian Council of Ministers Chairman Chervenkov's answers to questions posed by Ms. De Byrne, Belgrade correspondent of the London "Times," and Mr. E. Byrne, Belgrade correspondent of the American "Christian Science Monitor," who recently visited Bulgaria.

Speaking of the current international situation and the prospects for further easing tensions between East and West, Chervenkov said, "I am deeply convinced that further easing of tensions between East and West is a realistic prospect. The spirit of consultation and cooperation between countries with different social and political systems will be strengthened day by day. Although the forces of war have not ceased their activities, the forces of peace have grown rapidly and continue to grow."

Answering a question about the possibility of normalizing relations with Greece, Chervenkov said, "We have diplomatic relations with Greece and have signed a number of agreements. We sincerely hope that these relations will be completely normalized and become fully good-neighborly relations. We are ready to reach agreements on outstanding issues between us through direct negotiations with the Greek government, on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit."

Chervenkov said that the Bulgarian government has always disapproved of and does not now approve of the Balkan Pact, because two of the signatory countries are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, it should not be said that the participation of Yugoslavia, Turkey and Greece in the Balkan Pact excludes the possibility of Bulgaria maintaining normal and friendly relations with these countries. The Bulgarian government hopes to further consolidate peaceful and good-neighborly relations with the above-mentioned countries, even if they remain within the Balkan Pact.

Chervenkov emphasized that Bulgaria's relations with the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia are now developing normally. He said, "I believe that these relations will be strengthened day by day for the benefit of our two peoples and for peace in the Balkans."

    契尔文科夫答英美报纸记者问
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社索非亚5日讯：保加利亚各报刊登了保加利亚部长会议主席契尔文科夫回答不久前访问保加利亚的伦敦“泰晤士报”驻贝尔格莱德记者德·伯恩女士和美国“基督教科学箴言报”驻贝尔格莱德记者埃·伯恩所提出的问题。
    契尔文科夫在谈到目前国际局势和进一步缓和东西方之间的紧张局势的远景的时候说，我深信，进一步缓和东西方之间的紧张局势是现实的远景。协商精神和不同社会制度和政治制度的国家之间的合作将日益加强。虽然战争的势力并没有罢休，但是和平的力量已经急速地壮大起来，并且继续不断地壮大。
    契尔文科夫就同希腊关系的正常化的可能性的问题回答说：“我们同希腊有外交关系，签订了一些协定。我们真诚地希望这种关系彻底地正常化，而成为完全的善邻关系，我们准备通过同希腊政府的直接谈判，在互相尊重和互利的基础上就我们之间悬而未决的问题达成协议。”
    契尔文科夫说，保加利亚政府一直就不同情、现在也不同情巴尔干公约，因为这个公约当中有两个缔约国参加了北大西洋公约。但是，完全不应由此就说，南斯拉夫、土耳其和希腊参加了巴尔干公约，就排除了保加利亚同这些国家维持正常的友好关系的可能。保加利亚政府希望更加巩固同上述国家的和平善邻关系，即使它们仍然留在巴尔干公约之内。
    契尔文科夫强调指出，保加利亚同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的关系现在正在正常地发展。他说，我相信，这种关系将为了我们两国人民和巴尔干和平的利益而日益增强。
