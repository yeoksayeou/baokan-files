Tao Shuzeng's Speech

Comrade Chairman, esteemed committee members, comrades:

I fully agree with the reports by Chairman Zhou and the vice-chairmen.

As a scientific worker, I am greatly encouraged and inspired by the sections on intellectuals in Chairman Zhou's political report and Vice-Chairman Guo's report on the issue of intellectuals. I have studied and worked in hydraulic engineering. The Party and the government have given me their full trust, appointing me to be responsible for the water conservancy work of the entire province of Hubei. Now, please allow me to share my views on the relationship between administrative work and scientific research.

Since liberation, I have been teaching in the Civil Engineering Department of Wuhan University. In the autumn of 1951, I was transferred to the Hubei Provincial People's Government to undertake transportation administration work. Last spring, I was again transferred to serve as the Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau. When I first took on an administrative position, I had some ideological struggles while obeying the arrangements of my superiors. I thought administrative work was very busy, and I would no longer have time to engage in academic research, which was my long-term aspiration. Giving up this aspiration was regrettable. Several years of work experience have gradually changed my view on the relationship between academic research and administrative work.

I now believe that it is inevitable for many scientific workers to take on administrative work. It is still possible to engage in scientific and technological research or to organize and lead research work in administrative positions, as long as the issues of time, assistants, and equipment are resolved.

The water conservancy work of a province includes administrative, institutional, and enterprise aspects. There are many work threads, strong policy implications, and high technical requirements. Leaders must take care of the overall situation, and it is certain that the work is busy, but the time for scientific research can still be solved. The first step is to organize the functional departments of the agency according to the needs of the business, and assign the administrative work and responsibilities to the functional departments. The second step is for the leadership to exert the role of collective leadership, provide specific guidance, and divide responsibilities. In the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, my specific leadership work is technical leadership. I chair the bureau's meetings and participate in the bureau's Party group meetings. Opinions on comprehensive or important work are put forward at the Party group meetings, and after the Party group unifies its opinions, they are discussed at the bureau's meetings and specific arrangements are made. I listen to the reports of the departments once a week to check the progress and implementation of the work; on average, I report to the higher authorities or participate in meetings of the Provincial People's Committee every week, and these tasks take up an average of two to two and a half days per week. The remaining time can be used to study theory and policy, discuss and solve technical problems, and study scientific technology. Studying theory and policy is not only necessary to improve administrative skills, but also to improve technical skills. Studying, in addition to the half-day stipulated by the system, is done in the morning and evening. In addition to this, the time for technical work can account for half. It is possible to spend one-third of this half, about one day, on one's own research work.

Of course, spending one-sixth of the time on academic research is far from enough. This raises three questions: What to study? How to study? What are the requirements for one's own achievements? My job provides answers to the first two questions. The water conservancy problems in Hubei Province are very complex. To solve them well, it is necessary to start with comprehensive planning. There are many issues related to river basin planning. There are also many regional problems in technical design that have not yet been resolved, such as the foundation treatment of water-bearing silty sand layers in the Jianghan alluvial plain, and the laws of water pressure changes in silty sand layers, which need to be studied. Many problems have been discovered in the practice of river basin planning and large-scale hydraulic structure design. I am currently focusing on the presentation of problems and the collection of data. These many problems cannot be studied by individuals alone; it is necessary to organize forces to study them. In addition to the technical personnel of this department, I have also raised questions to the soil mechanics and foundation teaching and research group and the water conservancy soil improvement teaching and research group of Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy and Electricity, and asked them to assist in the research. Only by replacing individual independent research with collective research and division of labor can problems be solved more extensively and quickly. As for myself, because my scientific and theoretical level is low and my energy cannot be concentrated, I can only pay more attention to the work of the comprehensive group in planning; pay more attention to soil mechanics and foundations in design problems, and often give some suggestions to the researchers. Although I have less time, I can still help them achieve higher achievements.

The second issue is the issue of assistants. Water conservancy scientific research requires a lot of observation data. The Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has already established some survey, measurement, observation, experiment, construction, and management units; there are also some groups responsible for data collation and research. These organizations are all assistants to the researchers, that is, my assistants. For research topics, I can plan the work of various units in a planned way, collect necessary data, and organize them for specific purposes. Of course, these tasks are also part or all of the work of each unit.

The third issue is the issue of equipment. In Wuhan, the large-scale experimental equipment for water conservancy includes the hydraulic laboratory and open-air hydraulic test field of the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission; the Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy and Electricity has a fairly complete hydraulic laboratory; and the Water Conservancy Bureau also has a soil mechanics laboratory and several drilling teams. General research equipment can be added at any time in conjunction with the needs of the job. There is a budget for research expenses every year.

Because I personally bear administrative responsibility, it is more convenient to solve the problems of assistants and equipment required for research. Of course, it is also necessary to cooperate with other water conservancy institutions and colleges in the Wuhan area to avoid duplication and waste. Personnel and equipment that are not available in other areas or that cannot be called upon for frequent parallel operations are only solved by ourselves. Therefore, I believe that it is not contradictory for scientific and technical personnel to take on administrative work, as long as it is not work that is divorced from their profession.

In order to live up to the expectations of the Party and the government, and for the needs of water conservancy work in Hubei Province, I guarantee to study Marxism-Leninism hard, improve administrative efficiency, squeeze out more time to organize water conservancy scientific research work, and personally participate in professional research; to raise water conservancy work in Hubei Province from the old field of experience to the field of science, to quickly enrich water conservancy talents and improve their quality of work, to reach the national level within 7 years, and to approach the world level within 12 years. With the special care of the Party and the government, I believe that this task can be accomplished.

    陶述曾的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意周主席和各位副主席的报告。
    我是一个科学工作者，我从周主席的政治报告中关于知识分子部分和郭副主席关于知识分子问题的报告得到很大的鼓舞和启发。我曾学过和做过水利工程。党和政府给了我以充分信任，命我负责湖北全省的水利工作，现在请让我谈一谈我对行政工作与科学研究的关系的看法。
    我自解放后就在武汉大学土木系教书，1951年秋被调到湖北省人民政府担任交通行政工作，去年春又调任水利厅厅长。当我初走上行政岗位的时候，在服从上级的安排下也曾有过思想斗争。我认为行政工作很忙，不会再有工夫从事学术研究，而学术研究是我多年的愿望，放弃这个愿望是有些惋惜的。几年以来的工作经验使我对于学术研究与行政工作的关系逐渐改变了看法。
    我现在认为有许多科学工作者要担任行政工作，这是不可避免的。在行政岗位上依然可从事科学技术研究，或从事研究工作的组织领导，只要解决好时间问题、助手问题和设备问题。
    一省的水利工作包括行政、事业和企业三个方面。工作的头绪多，政策性强，技术性也要高。领导者要照顾全面，工作忙是肯定的，但从事科学研究工作的时间问题也还能够解决。首先是把机关的职能科室按业务的需要组织好，把事务性的工作和责任交给职能科室。其次是领导层发挥集体领导的作用，具体领导，分工负责。我在湖北省水利厅的具体领导工作是技术领导。我主持厅务会议，并参加厅的党组会。有关全面的工作或重要工作都在党组会上提出意见，经党组会统一了意见，再在厅务会议上讨论，并作具体布置。每周听取一次科室汇报，检查工作进度和执行情况；每周平均向上级汇报或参加省人民委员会的会议，这些工作每周平均占两天到两天半时间。其他的时间就可用来学习理论和政策，讨论解决技术问题，学习研究科学技术。学习理论和政策不仅是提高行政水平所必要的，也是提高技术水平所必要的。学习除制度规定的半天时间外，都是在早晚进行。除此以外，有关技术工作的时间可以占一半。在这一半的时间中抽出三分之一，约一天的时间做自己的研究工作是可能的。
    当然，以六分之一的时间作学术研究是很不够的，这就要提出三个问题，就是：研究什么？怎样研究？对自己成就的要求如何？在前两个问题上，我的岗位工作提供了答复。湖北省的水利问题是很复杂的。要解决得好，必须从综合规划入手。有关流域规划方面的问题是很多的。在技术设计方面也有许多地域性的问题还没有解决，例如江汉冲积平原的含水粉沙层基础处理问题，水压力在粉沙层中的变化规律等，都有待于研究。在流域规划工作和大型水工结构设计实践中发现的问题很多，我目前正着重在问题的提出和资料的搜集。这许多问题不是个人研究得了的，必须组织力量去研究。除了本部门的技术人员外，我还向武汉水利学院土壤基础教研组，水利土壤改良教研组提出问题，要求他们协助研究。只有用集体研究，分工研究代替个人独立研究才能够较大量地、较迅速地解决问题。至于我个人，因为科学理论水平低，精力又不能集中，只有在规划方面多注意综合组的工作；在设计问题方面多注意土壤基础，经常向研究人员们提出一些意见，虽然我的时间较少，还是可以协助他们获得较高的成就的。
    其次是助手问题。水利科学研究需要许多观测资料，湖北省水利厅目前已经设立了一些查勘、测量、观测、试验、施工、管理单位；关于资料整理研究也有了一些小组负责。这些组织都是研究人员的助手，也就是我的助手。为了研究专题，我可以有计划地布置各单位的工作，搜集必要的资料，为特定目的进行整理。当然这些工作也就是各单位岗位工作的一部或全部。
    再次是设备问题。在武汉，水利方面的大型试验设备有长江水利委员会的水工试验室和露天水工试验场；在水利学院有颇为完备的水力试验室；水利厅也有土力试验室和若干个钻探队。一般的研究设备可以结合岗位工作需要随时添置。研究费用每年都是有预算的。
    由于我个人负着行政责任，对研究所需的助手和设备问题，解决就更为便利。当然还须与武汉地区的其他水利机构和院校相配合，以避免重复和浪费。他方面所没有的，或经常平行作业不能调用的人员和设备才自己解决。因此，我认为科学技术人员担任行政工作，只要不是脱离专业的工作，对科学研究是没有矛盾的。
    为了不辜负党和政府的期望，为了湖北省水利工作的需要，我保证努力学习马克思列宁主义，提高行政工作效率，挤出更多的时间组织水利科学研究工作，个人也参加专业研究；把湖北省的水利工作从旧的经验的领域提高到科学的领域，迅速充实水利人才，提高其工作质量，7年内达到全国水平，12年内接近世界水平。在党和政府的特别关怀下，我相信这个任务是可以完成的。
