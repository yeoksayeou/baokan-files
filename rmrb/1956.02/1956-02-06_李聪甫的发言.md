Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I have listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of the leaders at the conference, and I fully agree and wholeheartedly support them.

Our country's first Five-Year Plan, formulated under the glorious guidance of the Party's General Line, has victoriously completed its third annual plan, and we are guaranteed to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year.

It can be seen that because our industry, especially the heavy industry which is the main force in developing the national economy, is advancing by leaps and bounds; because of the growth of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, and the increased agricultural production of the hundreds of thousands of agricultural cooperatives that have been established, a high tide of the socialist movement is arriving in the countryside; because of the development of industry and agriculture, the socialist revolution is growing in strength every day, promoting the unanimous demand of capitalist industry and commerce to take the road of state capitalism, and a high tide of joint state-private ownership of entire industries is rising in major cities across the country; just as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "Along with the surging high tide of socialist economic construction, there will be a high tide of cultural construction." This is the inevitable trend of new developments.

The state of science and technology in our country cannot yet meet the needs of new developments and is far behind the advanced levels of the world. The Party and Chairman Mao require intellectuals to catch up with the world's advanced levels of science and culture within twelve years, which is not too short a time. If our intellectuals can unite under the strong leadership of the Party, actively transform themselves, and give full play to their abilities, it is entirely possible.

I am a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Let me share my personal experiences and opinions on the issue of TCM. In China's long history, TCM has made certain contributions to the people's medical and healthcare. Currently, the people in the vast rural areas and nearly half of the population in large and medium-sized cities still rely on TCM for treatment. This is an undeniable fact. TCM has been in a feudal era for a long time, limited by social conditions, especially in semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. TCM practitioners, like workers and peasants, have suffered discrimination and oppression, and academic development has remained backward. This is also an undeniable fact. Due to the long-term influence of the old society, the influence of different TCM teaching methods, and the influence of the casual lifestyles of TCM practitioners, "influenced by what one constantly sees and hears," some TCM practitioners have become "arrogant and selfish with their skills," some "cling to the old and stick to conventions," some "denigrate others and elevate themselves," and some have "improper conduct and are only interested in profit," displaying all kinds of bourgeois ideas. I am one who came from a "formal apprenticeship" in TCM, imbued with strong "arrogant with skill" bourgeois ideas and style.

Since liberation, thanks to the Party's attention to TCM work and continuous ideological education, there have been varying degrees of improvement. However, sectarianism, individualism, and conservative thinking still exist to some extent. In terms of conservative thinking: one is sticking to conventions and being satisfied with the status quo; the other is being ambitious in research but lacking firm confidence. Most TCM practitioners suffer from this problem, and I am certainly one of them. This has greatly hindered our progress. The giant ship of the new era is moving forward very quickly. If we do not wake up, do not take the initiative to catch up, and especially if the remaining despicable bourgeois ideas are not thoroughly eliminated, we will fall far behind the new era and be spurned by the people.

Since the Party put forward the "implementing the correct policy towards TCM," especially the call for "Western medicine practitioners to learn from TCM," and the call to "unite TCM and Western medicine" to jointly "inherit and develop the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine," it has great significance in the history of medicine. Some TCM practitioners still do not understand the Party's policy towards TCM, and have developed the erroneous view of being arrogant, complacent, and thinking that TCM is completely "flawless." Individual Western medicine comrades also have some emotional fluctuations, producing the one-sided view that Western medicine should be abandoned to learn backward TCM. These ideological problems cannot be said to have been completely clarified. The reason is that they have not clearly recognized the key issue of Western medicine learning from TCM, which is to help TCM improve and enhance, thereby enriching the scientific content of modern medicine in essence.

Just for TCM itself, we should strengthen the self-requirement of studying the classics. TCM literature is "as vast as the sea." A person's knowledge is limited. There are many valuable experiential legacies buried in old books that need to be excavated. At the same time, we must also learn modern medical science knowledge, especially the advanced Soviet medicine. Using Pavlovian theory to explain traditional Chinese medicine is not far-fetched. TCM practitioners must catch up with the modern medical technology level in the country's great socialist construction and socialist transformation undertakings, and take the initiative to strive to unite with Western medicine. Only on the basis of the unity of TCM and Western medicine, through academic exchange methods, jointly researching and sorting out traditional Chinese medicine, to enrich the content of modern medicine, and better serve the people, is this beneficial. It is recommended that the health leadership departments actively support it. The main thing is that our TCM and Western medicine practitioners must unite politically and ideologically and work together to achieve a socialist society. I also have an incorrect opinion: if TCM wants to catch up with the world's advanced medical level, it must quickly conduct research in each person's specialty, and Western medicine does not have to be too broad, so as not to create a phenomenon of understanding everything but not being thorough in anything. If Western medicine wants to surpass the world's advanced medical level, it must also actively and critically accept traditional Chinese medicine without prejudice, and shine brightly in the world. To be able to complete the overall plan to eliminate the boundaries between TCM and Western medicine within 12 years, and realize the new medicine of our socialist country, this is a huge achievement for our TCM and Western medical workers.

Premier Zhou said: "We should improve the use and arrangement of intellectuals so that they can give play to their expertise that is beneficial to the country." I feel very happy about this extremely brilliant instruction. All TCM practitioners who have gone through advanced studies, have good results, have more experience, and have a correct style, should be able to be arranged to "apply what they have learned" in their jobs, so that they can exert their strength and adapt to the need to cultivate new forces. At present, there are still many areas lacking doctors and medicine in the vast rural areas, and they need help to organize joint clinics and provide appropriate business support, so that TCM practitioners can better work with peace of mind and exert their medical and preventive powers in the countryside.

In general, the high tide of cultural construction is about to arrive. In the warm wave of "marching towards science," Vice Chairman Guo Moruo said: "People engaged in health work should strengthen the unity and mutual learning of hundreds of thousands of TCM practitioners and tens of thousands of Western medicine practitioners, do a good job in urban factory and mine health work, and realize the requirements of the 'National Agricultural Development Program': eliminate the four pests, eliminate the nine major diseases, and protect women and children." It clearly points out the task of TCM. We must contribute our academic experience, bit by bit, without reservation, to the great socialist construction of the motherland. On this basis, we must strengthen political study and business study to improve our political and ideological level and scientific and technological level, and be able to catch up with the world's advanced medical level within the time planned by the state. This is an extremely pleasant undertaking. As long as TCM and Western medicine unite and work hard, we can fully achieve the great and glorious task entrusted to us by the Party and Chairman Mao.

Finally, I wish the conference a victory and the committee members and comrades good health!

    李聪甫的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    大会上听取了周恩来总理的政治报告，听取了首长们的各项报告，我完全表示同意，竭诚拥护。
    我们国家，在党的总路线光辉照耀下所制定的第一个五年计划，已经胜利地完成第三年度计划任务，并且保证在今年提前完成第一个五年计划。
    可以看到，由于我国工业特别是发展国民经济主要力量的重工业，正在一日千里的向前迈进；由于农业互助合作的成长和已经建立起来的几十万个农业合作社的农业增产，促使农村中社会主义运动的高潮的到来；由于工农业的发展，社会主义革命一天天的声势浩大，推动了资本主义工商业的一致要求走国家资本主义道路的过渡，全国各大城市中的全行业公私合营的热潮高涨；正如周总理报告中所指出：“随着汹涌澎湃的社会主义经济建设的高潮而来的，将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”这是新的形势发展的必然趋势。
    我国科学和技术的状况还不能适应新的形势发展的需要，还远远落后于世界先进的水平。党和毛主席要求知识分子能在十二年内不算太短的时间赶上世界先进的科学文化水平。如果我们知识分子都能团结在党的坚强领导之下，积极改造，充分发挥，是完全可能的。
    我是一个中医工作者，让我就中医问题发表我个人的体会和意见。中医在我国的悠久历史中，对人民医疗保健事业曾经作出了一定的贡献。就目前来说，全国广大农村中的人民和大、中城市将近半数的人口，还是依靠中医来治病的，这是不可否认的事实。中医长期处在封建时代，限于社会条件，尤其是在半殖民地半封建社会，中医和工人、农民一样，遭受歧视和压迫，学术停留于落后状态，这也是不可否认的事实。由于旧社会的长期影响，由于中医传授不同的影响，由于中医生活散漫的影响，“耳濡目染”，因此产生了有的中医“挟技自傲、保守自私”，有的中医“抱残守缺、固步自封”，有的中医“诋毁别人、抬高自己”，有的中医“作风不正、唯利是图”等各式各样的资产阶级思想。我就是一个“贽敬受业”的中医学徒出身，渲染了浓厚的“挟技自傲”的资产阶级思想和作风。
    解放几年以来，由于党对中医工作的重视和不断地进行思想教育，有了不同程度的改进和提高。但是，宗派主义、个人主义和保守思想，还是多少存在的。保守思想方面：一种是墨守成规，满足现状；另一种是钻研有志，信心不坚。大部分中医都犯了这个毛病，我当然是其中的一个。这样，大大地阻碍了我们的进步。新时代的巨轮向前转动得是很快的，我们再不清醒地、不主动地急起直追、迎头赶上，特别是残留下来的卑鄙的资产阶级思想如不彻底清除，就要远远落在新时代的后面，为人民所唾弃的。
    自从党提出“贯彻对待中医的正确政策”以后，特别是号召“西医学习中医”，号召“团结中西医”共同为“继承和发扬祖国医学遗产”而努力，是具有医学历史的重要意义的。某些中医，仍然不了解党对中医的政策，产生了自高自大、骄傲自满、以为中医是完全“无瑕可指”的错误看法。个别西医同志，情绪也有些波动，产生以为要丢掉西医来学习落后中医的片面看法。这些思想问题，还不能说是彻底澄清了。原因是没有明确认识西医学习中医的关键问题，是为了帮助中医改进和提高，从而丰富现代医学的科学内容的精神实质。
    单就中医本身来说，应加强经典著作研究的自我要求。中医文献，“浩如烟海”。一个人的学识是有限度的，有很多宝贵经验遗产，埋藏在故纸堆里，需要我们发掘。同时，还要学习现代医学科学知识，尤其是苏联先进医学的学习。运用巴甫洛夫学说解释祖国医学，是没有什么牵强的。中医工作者，必须在国家伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中迎头赶上现代医学技术水平，主动地争取团结西医。只有在中西医团结的基础上，通过学术交流的方法，共同研究和整理祖国医学，以充实现代医学的内容，更好地为人民服务，这是有好处的。建议卫生领导部门，积极支持。主要在于我们中西医要从政治思想上统一起来，为了实现社会主义社会而共同奋斗。我还有一个不正确的意见，中医要赶上世界医学先进水平，首先必须快马加鞭地就各人专长一科进行钻研西医学不必扯得太宽，以免造成件件都懂、件件不透的现象。西医要超过世界医学先进水平，也必须无成见地积极地批判地接受祖国医学，在世界上放一异采。能在12年以内完成消灭中西医界限的全面规划，实现成为我国社会主义的新医学，这才是我们中西医务工作者的巨大成就。
    周总理说：“应该改善对知识分子的使用和安排，使他们能够发挥对于国家有益的专长。”这种极其英明的指示，我感到非常愉快。凡是通过进修的中医，成绩好，经验多，作风正，要求能够安排到
  “学以致用”的工作岗位上去，使他们能够发挥力量，并且适应需要培养新生力量。目前广大农村中还有很多缺医缺药的地区，要求帮助它们组织联合诊所，并且适当地予以业务上的支持，使得中医更好安心地发挥他们在农村中的医疗预防的力量。
    总的说来，文化建设的高潮即将到来，在“向科学大进军”的热烈声浪中，郭沫若副主席说：“从事卫生工作的人，应该在几十万中医和几万西医加强团结和相互学习的基础上，做好城市厂矿卫生工作，实现‘全国农业发展纲要’的要求：清除四害，消灭九大疾病和保护妇婴。”很显明地指出了中医的任务。我们必须把自己的学术经验，一点一滴毫无保留地为伟大祖国的社会主义建设贡献出来，在这一基础上加强政治学习和业务学习来提高我们的政治思想水平和科学技术水平，能在国家全面规划的时间内赶上世界医学先进的水平，这就是一件无比愉快的事业。只要中西医团结起来，努力以赴，是完全可以达成党和毛主席交给我们的伟大而光荣的任务的。
    最后，敬祝大会胜利，委员们、同志们身体健康！
