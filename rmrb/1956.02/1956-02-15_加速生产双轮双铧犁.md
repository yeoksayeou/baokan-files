    Accelerate the Production of Two-Wheel Double-Share Plows

    This year, in the first quarter, farm implement factories across the country must produce 800,000 two-wheel double (single) share plows to meet the needs of farmers' spring plowing production after the vigorous development of the cooperative movement. Before spring plowing, producing one more two-wheel double-share plow can deeply cultivate 200 mu of land, increasing grain production by 4,000 jin. Putting these 800,000 two-wheel double (single) share plows into spring plowing can deeply cultivate over 100 million mu of land. This is a glorious task for all workers in farm implement factories.

    The decision to produce 800,000 two-wheel double (single) share plows in the first quarter represents an increase of 500,000 units compared to the production quantity arranged at last year's national farm implement professional conference. The task is arduous. However, under the close leadership of various provinces and cities, the allocation of labor, adjustment of equipment, and supply of standard parts and cooperative parts have been basically arranged; with the active support of relevant central departments, the supply of raw materials and transportation issues have also been basically resolved; and the workers of farm implement factories across the country, in the high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement and after further strengthening the education of the worker-peasant alliance, are also welcoming production tasks with unprecedented excitement and enthusiasm. This means that there is ample possibility to complete the production task of 800,000 two-wheel double (single) share plows in the first quarter.

    However, according to the recent inspection by the Third Ministry of Machine Building Industry, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenyang still have many problems in their production technical preparation work, preventing them from quickly entering large-scale normal production. For example, in the trial production of samples in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the quality has not fully met the standards, and the scrap rate is very high; due to the incomplete preparation of molds and tools, the trial production time has been extended; and the processing of many parts and components has not yet been officially put into production. Among the enterprises in various provinces that have already started normal production, some enterprises did not complete their production plans in January, and a few enterprises experienced work stoppages due to the untimely supply of raw materials. There are also quite serious management chaos in the enterprises. In addition, many problems have occurred in organizing the production and supply of standard parts and cooperative parts nationwide. For example, some regions that have undertaken cooperative tasks for other regions cannot seriously fulfill the contracts and deliver goods on time, or even request to cancel the contracts, due to the increased production tasks of their own factories or localities. If these situations are not quickly reversed with active measures, the completion of production tasks will be affected.

    In order to resolutely complete and strive to overfulfill the task of producing 800,000 two-wheel double (single) share plows in the first quarter, the most important thing is to do a good job in production technical preparation work, especially in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenyang. A comprehensive inspection should be conducted quickly. In particular, focus should be placed on checking the production or preparation for mass production of parts and components, whether the molds and tools are complete, whether the allocation of equipment and labor is balanced in the organization of cooperation and between various processes, and whether the supply of raw materials and standard parts and cooperative parts is compatible with the production arrangements. We must identify the weak links after mass production and take immediate measures to strive to quickly enter mass production. In terms of steps, a small batch of production should be carried out for a certain period of time after the sample trial production, and then quickly enter mass production. Enterprises in various provinces that have already started normal production should actively promote advanced process regulations, improve quality, and increase labor productivity to strive to overfulfill tasks.

    The central link in doing a good job in production technical preparation work lies in strengthening organizational leadership. Therefore, the industrial departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities should appoint a dedicated person to be responsible for managing this production work. They must personally take action, go deep into the production workshops, understand the daily production situation, solve problems on the same day, and pay attention to quality inspection work from the beginning, ensuring that unqualified products are not allowed to leave the factory.

    We must seriously value and guarantee the timely supply of standard parts and cooperative parts. All enterprises undertaking the production tasks of standard parts and cooperative parts for other regions must include cooperative tasks in their own production plans. In order to support the production of fraternal factories, we should pay more attention to cooperative tasks. Only in this way can we ensure that production plans are completed or overfulfilled nationwide.

    We must strengthen allocation and transportation work, ensuring that raw materials and standard parts, cooperative parts, etc., are quickly transported to the factory to guarantee timely supply. This requires organizing dedicated personnel to be responsible for expediting and checking the transportation of raw materials and standard parts, cooperative parts, preventing delays caused by work stoppages and affecting the completion of production tasks.

    Strengthening political work and carrying out inter-factory competitions are important guarantees for successfully completing the first quarter's production tasks. We must publicize to all workers the political significance of increasing the production of two-wheel double (single) share plows in promoting the agricultural cooperative movement and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance; use the method of detailed accounting to explain to all workers the economic significance of two-wheel double (single) share plows for deep plowing and increased production, in order to stimulate the workers' production enthusiasm.

    Now, there is only one and a half months left in the first quarter. Time is pressing. All localities must take urgent action and quickly deploy the above tasks, striving for large-scale normal production, to ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the glorious task of producing 800,000 two-wheel double (single) share plows in the first quarter of this year.

### 加速生产双轮双铧犁

    加速生产双轮双铧犁
    全国各地农具制造厂今年第一季度必须生产80万部双轮双（单）铧犁，供应合作化运动蓬勃发展以后的农民春耕生产的需要。在春耕以前，多生产一台双轮双铧犁就能深耕200亩土地，可以增产4，000斤粮食。这80万部双轮双（单）铧犁投入春耕以后，就可以使一亿多亩土地得到深耕。这是农具制造厂全体职工的一项光荣的任务。
    第一季度生产80万部双轮双（单）铧犁的决定，比去年全国农具专业会议上布置的生产数量，增加了50万部。任务是艰巨的。但是，在各省市抓紧领导的条件下，劳动力的调配、设备的调整、标准件和协作件的供应，都已经基本安排就绪；原材料供应以及交通运输等问题，在中央有关部门的积极支持之下，也已经基本解决；全国农具制造厂的职工，在农业合作化运动高潮中，在进一步加强工农联盟的教育之后，也正以空前兴奋热烈的情绪迎接生产任务。这就是说，第一季度完成80万部双轮双（单）铧犁生产任务有充分的可能。
    但是，据最近第三机械工业部的检查，北京、天津、上海、沈阳等四个市，在生产技术准备工作上目前还有不少问题，以致还不能迅速进入大批的正常的生产。例如：北京、天津、上海等市在样品试制中，质量还没有全部合格，废品率很高；由于胎模工具没有准备齐全，试制时间延长了；许多零件和部件的加工部分，也还没有正式投入生产。各省已经进行正常生产的企业中，有些企业一月份没有完成生产计划，少数企业因原材料供应不及时，发生了停工待料的现象，在企业的管理上也还有相当严重的混乱现象。此外，在全国范围内组织标准件、协作件的生产供应工作，也发生了不少问题。例如有些地区已经承担外区协作任务的，由于本厂或当地的生产任务加重了，就不能认真地执行合同按期交货，甚至要求取消合同。以上这些情况如不采取积极措施迅速扭转，就将影响生产任务的完成。
    为了坚决完成和争取超额完成第一季度生产80万部双轮双（单）铧犁的任务，最重要的是做好生产技术准备工作，特别是北京、天津、上海、沈阳四个市，应该迅速做一次全面检查。特别要着重检查零件和部件的生产或准备大批生产的情况，胎模工具是否齐备，在组织协作中和各工序之间，设备和劳动力的配备是否平衡，原材料和标准件、协作件的供应同生产安排是否相适应。必须找出大量生产后的薄弱环节，立即采取措施，争取迅速进入大批生产。在步骤上，应该在样品试制以后，用一定的时间进行小批生产，然后再迅速进入大批生产。各省已经进行正常生产的企业，应该积极推行先进的工艺规程，提高质量、提高劳动生产率，争取超额完成任务。
    做好生产技术准备工作的中心环节，在于加强组织领导。因此，各省、市的工业厅、局应指定一个专人负责管理这项生产工作，必须亲自动手，深入生产车间，做到了解每天的生产情况，当天解决问题，并且在开始的时候，就注意质量的检查工作，切实做到不合格的产品不准出厂。
    必须认真重视和保证标准件和协作件的及时供应。所有承担外区标准件、协作件生产任务的企业，必须将协作任务列入本企业的生产计划。为了支援兄弟厂的生产，应当更加重视协作任务，只有这样，才能保证在全国范围内完成或超额完成生产计划。
    要加强调拨运输工作，必须做到原材料和标准件、协作件等迅速运输到厂，保证及时供应。这就必须组织专人负责催办，随时检查原材料和标准件、协作件的输送情况，防止因为停工待料，影响生产任务的完成。
    加强政治工作、开展厂际竞赛是胜利完成第一季度生产任务的重要保证。必须向全体职工宣传增产双轮双（单）铧犁，对于推动农业合作化运动和加强工农联盟的政治意义；用算细账的办法向全体职工说明双轮双（单）铧犁，对于深耕增产的经济意义，以激发职工的生产积极性。
    现在，第一季度只有一个半月了，时间紧迫，各地必须紧急行动起来，对以上各项工作，迅速部署，为进行大批的正常的生产而努力，以保证完成和争取超额完成今年第一季度生产80万部双轮双（单）铧犁的光荣任务。
