Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th. Since the Geneva meeting of the four heads of government, activities involving the exchange of delegations between the Soviet Union and the United States in the fields of culture, science, and technology have significantly expanded. In this regard, the U.S. State Department, through the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, delivered a memorandum to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The memorandum stated that the U.S. government is concerned about the development of exchanges of delegations between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the U.S. side believes that such exchanges should be based on the principle of reciprocity and implemented according to plans drawn up in areas of common interest. The memorandum specifically suggested formulating a plan for the exchange of delegations in the fields of medicine and agriculture and expressed willingness to discuss this issue with Soviet representatives in Washington.

In response to the aforementioned memorandum, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a memorandum to the U.S. Embassy on the 3rd of last month. The memorandum stated that the Soviet government has repeatedly advocated for expanding the exchange of delegations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Soviet government agreed with the U.S. government's opinion that, in order for both parties to obtain the greatest benefit, it is best to formulate a plan for the exchange of delegations in each specific instance and to implement the principle of reciprocity when carrying out such exchanges.

The memorandum pointed out, when discussing private travel by individual citizens, that the Soviet government believes that the best results can be achieved if such travel is conducted based on the principle of reciprocity and without discriminatory restrictions. In this regard, the U.S. government's procedures of taking fingerprints and signing special forms when issuing U.S. entry visas are detrimental to the development of such travel, making it impossible for Soviet citizens to travel to the United States for private purposes. The Soviet government hopes that the U.S. government can implement the principle of reciprocity when arranging the travel of individual Soviet citizens to the United States and change the procedures for issuing U.S. entry visas.

The memorandum concluded by saying that the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the U.S. State Department's suggestion to formulate a plan for the exchange of delegations in the fields of medicine and agriculture to be appropriate and is willing to begin negotiations on this issue, as well as on the exchange of delegations in the fields of culture, power machinery manufacturing, public catering, and so on.

    就苏美两国间在文化科学方面互换代表团事
    苏联政府答复美国的备忘录
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联和美国间在文化、科学和技术方面互换代表团的活动在四国政府首脑日内瓦会议以后已经显著地扩大。在这方面，美国国务院通过美国驻莫斯科大使馆向苏联外交部递交了一个备忘录，备忘录指出：美国政府关心苏联和美国互换代表团事宜的发展，美国方面认为这种交换应该依据互惠原则并且按照在共同感到兴趣的各方面拟就的计划来执行。备忘录具体建议拟定一个在医药和农业方面互换代表团的计划，并且表示愿意同苏联代表在华盛顿讨论这个问题。
    为了答复上述备忘录，苏联外交部在上月3日向美国大使馆递交了一份备忘录。备忘录说，苏联政府曾一再主张苏联和美国扩大交换代表团。苏联政府同意美国政府提出的为了使双方能够获得最大利益，最好在每一具体事例上拟定一个互换代表团的计划而且在执行这种交换时实行互惠原则的意见。
    备忘录谈到公民个人的私人旅行的时候指出，苏联政府认为，如果依据互惠和不予以歧视性限制的原则来进行这种旅行，是可以获得最良好的结果的。在这方面，美国政府实行的颁发美国入境签证时按指印和在特制的表格上签字的手续，是不利于这种旅行的发展的，它使得苏联公民不可能去美国作私人旅行。苏联政府希望美国政府在安排苏联公民个人在美国的旅行时能实行互惠原则，并且改变颁发美国入境签证的手续。
    备忘录最后说，苏联外交部认为美国国务院关于拟定一个在医药和农业方面互换代表团的计划的建议是适宜的，并且愿意开始在这个问题上以及在文化、动力机械制造、公共饮食等等方面互换代表团问题上进行谈判。
