    Welcoming the First Spring Festival After Public-Private Partnership
    ——A Visit to Dongdan Vegetable Market in Beijing
    Hao Jie
    In the days leading up to the Spring Festival, the Dongdan Vegetable Market in Beijing was a truly grand sight. The entrances and exits of the market were bustling with people all day long, with lines of shoppers one after another. One sales clerk excitedly told me, "This year's Spring Festival customers are more than any other year." Indeed, this year's Spring Festival sales volume and revenue in Dongdan Vegetable Market have increased by more than double compared to last year's Spring Festival. They have to sell one hundred and fifty to sixty pigs every day, and more than 10,000 catties of fresh fish are needed daily to satisfy the buyers. Many salespeople are so busy that they don't even have time to drink water, and some even get sick from exhaustion. However, they say, "As long as the customers are satisfied, we feel happy no matter how tired we are."
    The Dongdan Vegetable Market was established 38 years ago by fifty or sixty small business owners with limited capital. Now, there are a total of 105 households and more than 210 employees. In the era of capitalist free competition, in order to overwhelm their competitors and gain a foothold, they all painstakingly studied their respective businesses. After accumulating decades of business experience, they understand the characteristics of each commodity and are clear about the production, transportation, and sales laws of each commodity. In terms of business management and service attitude, they are even more skilled in the art of catering to customers' buying psychology and meeting the different needs of different customers.
    Under normal circumstances, no matter what goods, they welcome customers to choose freely; if you want to buy chicken or fish but don't know how to clean it, they will completely follow your wishes and clean it thoroughly for you; if government agencies or organizations need any goods, they will deliver the goods to your door in a timely manner with just a phone call. Restaurants and government canteens often need hundreds of catties of chickens or fish of the same size, and they also guarantee to choose them evenly; when seasonal foods such as yellow croaker are on the market in large quantities, housewives always like to buy twenty or thirty catties to pickle. If there is no time limit, they are willing to deliver it to your home. For large fish weighing more than ten catties, they will cut it into three sections, price them differently, and customers can buy the head if they like it, or the tail if they like it. Customers are satisfied, and the goods sell quickly. Similarly, they will also divide a whole ham into five sections according to the middle section, the tip of the claw, and other parts. Customers can choose any part of the ham according to their taste at a reasonable price. Different foods are also prepared here for Hui and Han people who have different eating habits. Dongdan Vegetable Market has always paid special attention to the seasonality of purchasing goods. Whenever vegetables such as cucumbers, broad beans, tomatoes, and eggplants are on the market, they are always the fastest to buy them.
    On January 17 this year, Dongdan Vegetable Market was approved to prepare for public-private partnership. At that time, employees were unsure about the dividend issue after the inventory of assets; worried about their future work arrangements; and did not know how to work after the partnership. The Commercial Section of the Dongdan District People's Committee convened an expanded meeting of Dongdan Vegetable Market owners on January 19. At the meeting, it was announced that some difficult issues in the asset inventory work would be temporarily put aside to be resolved later, and the original management systems such as accounting, profit sharing, rewards, and wages would also remain unchanged for the time being. The main task at present is to actively organize sources of goods, maintain the original business characteristics, and ensure that the Spring Festival supply is met. In this way, all owners and workers clearly understood that the main task at present was to quickly shift the focus of work to doing a good job in the current Spring Festival supply work.
    Dongdan Vegetable Market was officially transformed into a public-private partnership on January 21. They immediately started to prepare the Spring Festival purchase plan, correctly estimated the level of increased purchasing power of the people this year, and increased the purchase plan for various goods this spring by 20% compared to last year's Spring Festival. The purchase volume of major commodities was increased by more than double. After the plan was formulated, they went to various specialized companies to understand the supply situation. As a result, they found that there was a shortage of live chickens. At the meeting of the Public-Private Partnership Working Committee, the private sector proposed that they had direct purchasing relationships in the past. After obtaining the consent of the specialized company, they sent people to Tong County, Baodi, Gaobeidian, Changxindian and other production areas to purchase directly, which solved the problem of insufficient supply of live chickens. They also maintained the old supply relationship with the original second-level wholesalers for some special products (such as local specialties) that other specialized companies did not have, and actively organized purchases. The original supply and marketing credit relationship has not changed, so when one party in the supply and marketing has insufficient funds, it has not affected the purchase and sale of goods at all. They also maintained close contact with the purchasing agents sent to various specialized companies. The salespeople told the purchasing agents about the market's sales situation at any time, and the purchasing agents also told the salespeople about the supply situation of the supplying units at any time. Therefore, in the first busy Spring Festival after the public-private partnership, except for a very few fish such as mandarin fish that could not be purchased temporarily due to heavy snow in the producing area, and individual fine vegetables that were out of stock due to insufficient output in the suburbs, most of the products did not run out of stock. They also added many new varieties according to customer requirements. Customers said, "After taking a turn in the Dongdan Vegetable Market, you can get all the New Year goods."
    After the public-private partnership, in terms of management systems, they also actively carried out some reforms that are convenient for customers to purchase, conducive to the current business, and can be done now. In the past, individuals had their own fixed sites. In winter, some chickens and fish that were not afraid of freezing were inside, while green vegetables and bean products that were afraid of freezing were placed at the entrance where the wind was blowing; the bean sprouts were frozen with ice, and the good Shandong cabbage was frozen into a semi-transparent color. Now, they have become a family, and have made a unified adjustment in this regard based on the overall interests. They concentrated the vegetables, bean products and other foods that are afraid of freezing in special houses farther away from the door to ensure the quality of the vegetables. In the past, the business of local products and food was in a small room with a small facade, as narrow and messy as a pigeon house. Now, the partition walls have been opened, and the goods are also displayed in categories according to variety. This greatly facilitates customers to choose from a variety of similar products.
    After the public-private partnership, due to the continuous education of the leadership, the salespeople generally strengthened their sense of responsibility and mass viewpoint compared to the past. In the past, some of them, in order to earn more money for themselves, underweighed the goods and sold the food that had been found to be about to deteriorate to customers. These phenomena existed. Now, each of their groups and teams has a layer-by-layer responsibility system to ensure quality and quantity. In the past, when the Spring Festival was busy, some owners would pack up their stalls and go home. Now, they not only extended their working hours, but also patiently introduced the characteristics and cooking methods of new products to customers. The largest sales volume during the Spring Festival is pork. Almost every day, one hundred and fifty to sixty pigs have to be sold, which is ten times more than usual. The amount of labor for selling meat and removing bones is very large. The meat workers' wrists are sore from exhaustion, and customers complain that they have to wait too long. The Public-Private Partnership Working Committee held a meeting to study how to solve the problem. At that time, someone at the meeting suggested: Let's just issue tickets! Sell according to the tickets, so we don't have to be exhausted to death, and customers have to wait in line. However, the public representative considered that using the method of issuing tickets would inevitably prevent some customers from buying meat. Therefore, another method was considered, and the company was requested to allocate temporary workers to help remove bones. The original meat workers only sold meat. In this way, work efficiency was improved, and it was also guaranteed that customers who came to Dongdan Vegetable Market to buy meat during business hours could buy enough meat.
    However, after the public-private partnership, because the sales volume of all major commodities has increased by more than double, the baskets for holding goods and the sacks for packing goods cannot always be cleaned up. Therefore, they are planning to build a warehouse to store these things. They also considered that: the people's living standards are improving so quickly, and the quantity and variety of goods purchased are increasing more and more. In order to ensure the quality of the goods, a cold storage room should be built. For the sake of people's health, salespeople should wear work clothes, and dust-proof equipment should also be added to the market. They plan to further adjust the sales site and labor organization after the Spring Festival. The young and strong should be in charge of the store, and the older ones should be in charge of the warehouse or do commodity sorting work. These are simple and easy to implement, but they are good beginnings. It can be imagined that by then, the Dongdan Vegetable Market will be much neater and cleaner than it is now, the variety will be more than it is now, and the service attitude of the salespeople will be better than it is now.

    迎接公私合营后的第一个春节
    ——访北京市东单菜场
    郝洁
    临近春节的几天，北京市东单菜市场真是盛况空前。菜场的几个出入口整天人流不息，买货排队的行列一个挨着一个，一个接着一个。一个售货员兴冲冲地对我说：“今年春节的顾客比哪一年都多。”的确，今年春节东单菜市场的卖货数量和卖钱额都比去年春节增加了一倍多，每天都得卖一百五、六十头猪，每天没有1万多斤鲜鱼也打发不了买主。很多售货员忙得连口水都顾不上喝，有的甚至累病了，可是他们却说：“只要顾客满意，我们再累心里也痛快。”
    东单菜市场是在38年以前由五、六十个资金不多的小业主组成的。现在共有105户、210多名从业人员。在资本主义自由竞争的年代里，他们为了压倒同行，使自己站得住脚，各自都非常精心钻研自己所经营的业务。积累了几十年的经营经验，他们了解每种商品的特点，清楚每种商品的产运销规律。在经营管理和服务态度方面，他们更具有尽量迎合顾客买货心理、满足不同顾客不同需要的经商艺术。
    在一般情况下，不管什么货，他们都欢迎顾客任意挑选；如果你要买鸡买鱼，自己不会收拾，他们会完全遵照你的意愿替你收拾得干干净净；如果机关、团体需要什么货，只要打个电话，他们就会及时把货送上门，饭馆、机关食堂经常需要上百斤的又是分量大小都相同的鸡或鱼，他们也保证给挑得均匀；黄花鱼等季节性食品大量上市的时候，家庭主妇们总喜欢买上二、三十斤腌起来，如果不限定时间，他们也肯给送到家里。十几斤重的大鱼，他们会把它切成三段，分等定价，顾客爱吃头就买头，爱吃尾就买尾，顾客满意，货又销的快；同样，他们也会把一只整火腿按照中段、爪尖等部位分成五个部段，顾客可以根据自己的口味用合理的价钱选购一只火腿的任何一部分。回民、汉民等有不同的饮食习惯，在这里也为他们准备了不同的食品。东单菜市场一向特别注意进货的季节性。每当黄瓜、扁豆、西红柿、茄子等菜蔬上市的时候，他们总是最快最早地买到手。
    今年1月17日，东单菜市场被批准筹备公私合营，当时职工思想上对清产核资以后的股息问题不摸底；担心自己将来的工作安排；也不知道合营后应该怎样工作。东单区人民委员会商业科就在1月19日召开了东单菜市场的业主扩大会议，会上宣布：清资核产工作中一些繁难问题，暂时放下留待以后解决，原有会计、分红、奖励、工资福利等经营管理制度也暂时不变，目前的主要任务是积极组织货源，保持原有经营特点，保证满足春节供应。这样，就使所有业主和工人明确了当前的主要任务是迅速把工作重点转向搞好当前的春节供应工作上去。
    1月21日东单菜市场正式公私合营了。他们马上就着手编制春节的进货计划，正确估计到今年人民购买力提高的水平，把今年春季各种货物的进货计划都订得比去年春节增加20％，主要商品的进货量则增加了一倍以上。计划订出后，他们就分别到各专业公司去了解货源情况。结果发现活鸡缺乏货源。在公私合营工作委员会的会议上，资方就提出他们过去有直线采购的关系，取得专业公司同意以后，就派人到通县、宝砥、高碑店、长辛店等产地去直接采购，解决了活鸡货源不足的问题。其他一些专业公司不掌握的特种产品（如土特产），他们也和原有的二批发商保持着旧有的供应关系，积极组织进货。原有供销赊欠关系也没有改变，所以当供销双方有一方资金周转不灵时，也丝毫没有影响进货和销货。他们还随时和派到各专业公司去的采购员保持密切联系，售货员随时把市场的销货情况告诉给采购员，采购员也随时把供货单位的货源情况告诉给售货员。因此，在公私合营后的第一个繁忙的春节里，除了桂鱼等极少数鱼类因产地下大雪，暂时采购不上来，和个别细菜蔬因郊区产量不足而脱销外，绝大部分产品都没有发生脱销的现象。他们还根据顾客的要求增加了不少新品种。顾客说：“到东单菜市场转上一圈，年货就办齐了。”
    公私合营以后，在经营管理制度方面，凡是便利顾客购买、对搞好当前经营有利的、又是现在就能够做到的，他们也积极地进行了一些改革。过去，他们个人有自家的固定地盘，到了冬天，有的不怕冻的鸡呀鱼呀在里边，怕冻的青菜、豆制品反而摆在出入口吹风的地方；豆芽冻上了冰渣，好好的山东大白菜被冻得变成了半透明的颜色。现在，他们成了一家人，根据整体利益在这方面做了统一的调整，把怕冻的蔬菜、豆制食品等集中在距离门口较远的特备的房子里，保证了菜的质量。过去，经营土产食品的是一家一个小间门面，像鸽子房一样窄小而零乱。现在，隔墙都打开了，商品也按品种分门别类地集中陈列起来。这样，就大大便于顾客在同类产品中的多样品种中进行选择。
    公私合营后，由于领导上的不断教育，售货员们一般都比过去加强了责任心和群众观点。过去，他们之中有的为了自己多赚一点钱，过秤偏低，把已经发现快要变质的食物胡弄着卖给顾客，这些现象都是有的。现在他们每一个大组和小组都有层层负责制，做到保质保量。过去常常当春节正繁忙的时候，有些业主就收拾摊子回家去了。现在，他们不但延长了工作时间，还耐心地向顾客介绍新商品的特点和烹调方法。春节中销售量最大的是猪肉，几乎每天都要卖上一百五、六十头猪，比平时增加了十倍，卖肉剔骨头的劳动量非常大，卖肉工人手捥子累得酸痛，顾客还抱怨等的时间太长。公私合营工作委员会就开会研究如何解决，当时会上有人提出：咱们干脆发牌吧！照牌卖，省得咱们累个死，顾客还得排队等。可是公股代表考虑到用发牌的办法，势必使一部分顾客买不到肉。于是，另外想了个办法，请求公司拨给临时工人专门帮助剔骨头，原来卖肉的工人光卖肉。这样一来，工作效率提高了，也保证了在营业时间内到东单菜市场买肉的顾客都能买到足够的肉。
    但是，公私合营以后，因为所有主要商品的销货数量都增加了一倍以上，盛货的筐子和包装货物的麻袋总清理不完，因此，他们正计划修建一个仓库，堆放这些东西。他们还考虑到：人民生活水平提高得这样快，进货数量、品种愈来愈多，为了保证货物质量，应该修个冷藏室。为了人民健康，售货员应该穿上工作服，场内也应该增添防尘设备。他们计划春节过后，进一步调整卖货场地和劳动组织，年青力壮的应付门市，年纪大的看仓库或做商品整理工作。这些都是简而易行的，但却是良好的开端。可以想见，到那时，东单菜市场将比现在要整齐、清洁得多，品种要比现在更多，售货员的服务态度也要比现在更好。
