    Changchun Workers Break Original Technical and Economic Targets
    In the discussion and formulation of measures to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule, many industrial and transportation workers in Changchun City have broken through the original technical and economic targets. After discussions by the workers, the economic indicators of the local state-owned Metrology Factory were revised seven times, with the output value and production volume both doubling compared to the original plan. At the Changchun Garment Factory, 30 groups proposed to revise 78 labor quotas. Workers at the Changchun Vehicle Section of the Chinese Railway took the initiative to send representatives to the leadership to request a comprehensive review and revision of quotas. Ma Hongfen, a model worker at the State-owned No. 8 Rubber Factory, mobilized the four most technically skilled workers in her group to help everyone learn techniques, deciding to increase the production volume of all 14 workers in the group from 520 pairs of rubber shoes per day to over 800 pairs within half a year. Some veteran technicians at the local state-owned Changchun Shoe Factory took the initiative to publicize their techniques, actively helping workers improve tools and operational processes. In January, this factory put forward more than 100 rationalization proposals, improved more than 50 kinds of shoe-making tools, and increased production efficiency by 1 to 10 times. Engineers and technicians at the Changchun Cigarette Factory and Pharmaceutical Factory actively and enthusiastically used their rest time to give technical lessons to workers, helping them improve their technical level. Zhang Xigui, a locomotive section worker at the Changchun Railway Bureau, who was always considered "old-fashioned," had been unwilling to exceed axle load over the years. Each train could only pull a maximum of 2,200 tons. Recently, he broke with conservative thinking and exceeded axle load three times in January, pulling 2,700 tons.

    长春职工纷纷突破原订技术经济指标
    长春市许多工业和交通运输业职工在讨论和制定提前一年完成五年计划的措施中，纷纷突破原订的技术经济指标。地方国营度量衡厂今年的经济指标，经过职工讨论以后，作了7次修改，产值和产量都较原计划提高了一倍。长春服装厂有30个小组，提议修改78项劳动定额。中国铁路长春车辆段职工派出代表主动向领导方面提出全面审查和修改定额的要求。国营橡胶第八厂劳动模范马洪芬，发动全组4个技术最高的工人，帮助大家学习技术，决定在半年内把全组14个工人的生产量由日产520双胶鞋提高到800双以上。地方国营长春制鞋厂有些老技工主动公开技术，积极帮助工人改进工具和操作过程。1月份这个工厂提出了100多件合理化建议，改进了50多种制鞋工具，提高了生产效率1倍到10倍。长春卷烟厂、制药厂的工程师和技术人员，都积极热情地利用休息时间给工人讲技术课，帮助工人提高技术水平。长春铁路分局机务段一向被称为“老保守”的张喜贵，历年都不愿超轴。每列车最多只能牵引2，200多吨。最近他打破了保守思想，在1月份连续3次超轴2，700吨。
