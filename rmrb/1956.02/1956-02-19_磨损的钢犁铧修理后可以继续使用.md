    Worn Steel Plowshares Can Be Reused After Repair
    To the Editor:
    The steel plowshare is the main part of a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow (or single-furrow plow). After a period of use, the plow point and cutting edge of the steel plowshare become worn. In many places, farmers throw away the worn steel plowshares or sell them as scrap steel. This is a great loss because steel plowshares are made of high-quality steel and can continue to be used after repair. According to experiments, an old steel plowshare, after being forged and extended, can be used for half as long as a new plowshare, and a plowshare can be forged and extended two to three times.
    In order to save steel and solve the problem of insufficient supply of steel plowshares, I suggest that industrial departments, handicraft production cooperatives, and farm tool repair stations should actively and responsibly repair worn plowshares for farmers.

### 磨损的钢犁铧修理后可以继续使用

    磨损的钢犁铧修理后可以继续使用编辑同志：
    钢犁铧是双轮双铧犁（或单铧犁）的主要零件。钢犁铧使用了一定的时期以后，犁尖和刃口就被磨损了。不少地方的农民就把磨损的钢犁铧扔掉或者当废钢铁卖掉了。这是一个很大的损失。因为钢犁铧都是用优质钢做的，磨损以后经过修理就能够继续使用。据实验，旧钢犁铧经过锻延后，可以顶半个新犁铧用，而一个犁铧可锻延二次到三次。
    为了节省钢材，并解决钢犁铧供不应求的问题，我建议工业部门、手工业生产联合社和农具修配站，要积极负责地为农民修理磨损了的犁铧。　晓晨
