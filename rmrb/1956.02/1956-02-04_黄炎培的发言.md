Huang Yanpei's Speech

Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

Over the past few days, we have listened to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and several other reports. I now represent the China Democratic National Construction Association in expressing our heartfelt support for the aforementioned reports.

Starting at the beginning of January this year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, following the high tide of agricultural cooperation that is unfolding across the country, first Beijing, and then all large and medium-sized cities across the country, have seen a thriving high tide of handicrafts cooperation and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Everywhere is filled with the sound of firecrackers, gongs, and drums, and cheers, celebrating the entry into socialist society.

On the day our meeting opened, representatives of workers, peasants, handicraftsmen, and industrialists and businessmen from across the country reported the good news to Chairman Mao. Although it was only a short half hour, the significance was very profound. Comrades! We must recognize that they represent the sentiments of 600 million people, and the good news they reported is a major joyful event in the process of socialist revolution, socialist transformation, and socialist construction.

From the perspective of private industry and commerce, a leap-forward development has emerged during this high tide of socialist transformation. This is the result of the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao over the past six years, and the result of the Party and the government's unity and education of the industrial and commercial sectors over the past six years. I must point out to the conference that Chairman Mao's instructions to the industrial and commercial sectors last October have played an immeasurable role in promoting this. The phrase "understand the laws of social development and master your own destiny" has touched the hearts of every industrialist and businessman. After hearing the transmission of Chairman Mao's instructions, the broad masses of industrialists, businessmen and their families, connecting it with their own experiences over the past six years, have irresistibly generated enthusiasm for embarking on the socialist path. "Listen to Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and make contributions to socialism" has become the slogan of action for the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen.

There are many moving examples that have emerged during this period. The China Democratic National Construction Association recently held a reporting conference on the work of the families of industrialists and businessmen. Let me cite a few examples from this conference:

At the reporting conference, some said: A mother of eight children, participating in the celebratory parade, put on new clothes, and when she walked in front of the rostrum, she said: She felt that this was precisely "marching forward towards socialism with great strides!" Some said: An old lady in her 60s and three female comrades, one of whom was six or seven months pregnant, carried large red "happiness" characters, braving the heavy snow, at the forefront of the industrial and commercial contingent.

The day before yesterday, when reporting the good news to Chairman Mao, two family members who attended the reporting conference specially bought floral clothes from the department store in order to see Chairman Mao, and said that they would lock these commemorative floral clothes in a box and keep them for their daughters to wear when they get married.

These examples are inexhaustible. The industrialists and businessmen's love for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao comes from the bottom of their hearts, and their confidence in taking the socialist road is becoming increasingly firm.

Chairman Mao instructed at the Supreme State Conference on January 25: "In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed nationwide." This is a conclusion made by Chairman Mao after analyzing the recent situation of socialist transformation across the country, and we all agree that it is very correct. The China Democratic National Construction Association sincerely supports this great instruction of Chairman Mao. We must, under the leadership of the Party, develop our organization, strengthen ideological education for our members, unite and educate more industrialists and businessmen, and strive to thoroughly realize socialist transformation and Chairman Mao's instructions.

To this end, the central task of the China Democratic National Construction Association for the next three years (1956 to 1958) will still be to cultivate and improve the backbone elements of the industrial and commercial sectors. We must cultivate them well, quickly, and in large numbers, to adapt to the development situation and requirements of our country's socialist revolution. After the high tide of industry-wide joint state-private ownership, the requirements for backbone elements have greatly developed. We must not think that everything is fine once joint state-private ownership has been achieved. The socialist revolution is still moving forward, and backbone elements must lead the way forward. Those who have made contributions in the joint state-private ownership movement will certainly be remembered by the people, but the movement is also developing, and if backbone elements do not keep up, they will fall behind the movement. The basic tasks after industry-wide joint state-private ownership: For enterprises, it is to further transform into socialist enterprises; for industrialists and businessmen, it is to further transform into laborers who abandon exploitation and support themselves by their own labor. Therefore, the most important work of backbone elements in the future is to assist the government in completing the above tasks, not only to understand these issues ideologically and prepare conditions themselves, but also to motivate and help as many people as possible to understand these issues and prepare conditions, so that when the final replacement of capitalist ownership with ownership by the whole people is achieved, it will be a case of "the fruit ripens and falls" and "water flows into the channel," and like the high tide of joint state-private ownership, there will be an even more widespread scene of festivity with lanterns and colored streamers and the sound of gongs and drums.

This must be achieved, and it will certainly be achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Naturally, to fully realize the above requirements, we must actively and earnestly do a series of tasks, among which the most important and key task is learning. We must organize and help backbone elements to learn well, quickly, and in large quantities according to the requirements for the further transformation of enterprises and people. This is the central work of our China Democratic National Construction Association for the next three years.

The importance of learning can be clearly seen from the current situation in the industrial and commercial sectors. Take the joint state-private ownership movement as an example. Tens of thousands of industrialists and businessmen have submitted applications and actively participated in the work. This is an expression of socialist consciousness, and it can be affirmed. However, how many people have clearly understood why the capitalist system of exploitation must be replaced by the socialist system? I am afraid it is still a big question mark! There are still many people who have not recognized exploitation; some people still do not understand what benefits socialism has. The objective situation is developing rapidly, and therefore, the situation in the industrial and commercial sectors where understanding lags behind reality is particularly prominent, or will become particularly prominent. Faced with the historical task of our country's socialist revolution being basically completed in about three more years, this situation must be quickly changed. For the China Democratic National Construction Association, it is to first help and educate members within two or three years to combine personal transformation with practice in enterprises, learn socialist management methods, and develop labor habits and skills. On the other hand, through the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism, connect with reality, thoroughly criticize capitalist ideology, and establish socialist ideology. At the same time, this association must also organize and help members to ensure that they play a backbone role in the ideological transformation and learning work of the industrial and commercial sectors. If the above-mentioned learning work is done well, this will be the most important condition to prepare for the industrial and commercial sectors to victoriously pass the socialist test.

Comrades! Let us study hard, actively transform, and prepare to pass this test victoriously!

I would also like to talk about the issue of intellectuals in passing. I fully agree with the policy put forward by Chairman Zhou Enlai in his political report: "To the fullest extent mobilize and give play to the strength of existing intellectuals, constantly raise their political consciousness and professional level, and train new forces on a large scale to expand their ranks, in order to adapt to the constantly growing demands of the country for intellectuals." Chairman Zhou Enlai pointed out: "Helping intellectuals carry out self-transformation is of extremely great significance for fully mobilizing and giving play to the strength of intellectuals. The majority of intellectuals in our country have already or are standing on the side of socialism, but many of them inevitably still have bourgeois viewpoints and styles to varying degrees in their thinking and actions." Comrades! I am also an intellectual, and I have worked in the education sector for more than 30 years. I have considerable connections with the intellectual circles across the country, and I deeply realize that the ideological transformation of intellectuals is an arduous task. I am willing to join with intellectuals across the country to study Marxism-Leninism hard and eliminate the influence of capitalism, individualism, and idealism in our thinking. Over the past six years, intellectuals have made great contributions to the country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In the future, they will further unite around the Chinese Communist Party and strive for the great cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country. As for the China Democratic National Construction Association, there are also many intellectuals in the association who should actively participate in this struggle. On the other hand, in the past few years, intellectuals inside and outside the association have given great help to the association's propaganda and education work, such as holding systematic political theory studies, report meetings, and various lectures. I hope that we will continue to work together in the future and strengthen our efforts.

Comrades! The various undertakings of our motherland are progressing smoothly and rapidly. The task of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce that is before us is so glorious! How great! We must complete this task together with the people of the whole country. We guarantee that we will be able to complete our task!

    黄炎培的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这几天来，我们听取了周恩来主席的政治报告和其他几个报告，我现在代表中国民主建国会对于上述报告表示衷心拥护。
    从今年1月初开始，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，接在正开展中的全国农村的合作化高潮之后，首先是北京，一会儿全国大中城市都如火如荼地出现了手工业合作化和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮，到处爆竹声、锣鼓声、欢呼声，喧天震地庆祝进入社会主义社会。
    我们这次会议开幕那天，全国工人代表、农民代表、手工业者代表、工商界代表向毛主席报喜，虽短短的半小时，意义倒是十分深长，同志们！我们必须认识他们所代表的是6万万人的心意，他们所报的喜事，是社会主义革命、社会主义改造、社会主义建设过程中的大喜事。
    从私营工商业方面说来，在这次社会主义改造高潮中间，出现了飞跃式的发展。这是6年来中国共产党和毛主席英明正确领导的成果，这是党和政府6年来团结、教育工商界的成果。我必须向大会指出，毛主席去年10月对工商界的指示更是起了无可估计的推动作用。“认识社会发展规律，掌握自己命运”这句话打动了每一个工商业者的心坎。广大的工商业者和他们的家属在听了关于毛主席的指示的传达以后，联系到6年来自己亲身所体验到的，不可遏止地产生了走上社会主义道路的积极性。“听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，为社会主义立功”，这已经成为广大工商业者的行动口号。
    这一时期所出现的动人的事例非常多，中国民主建国会最近召开工商界家属工作汇报会，我姑且从这个会中间举几个例子：
    汇报会上有的说：一位8个孩子的母亲，参加庆祝大游行，穿上新衣，走到主席台前的时候，她说：自己感觉到这正是“大踏步向着社会主义前进！”有的说：一位60岁的老太太和三位女同志，中间一位还怀着六、七个月身孕，扛着大红喜字，冒着大雪，走在工商界队伍的最前头。
    前天向毛主席报喜时，有两位出席汇报会的家属，为了见毛主席，特地向百货大楼买花衣服穿上，还说要把这件有纪念意义的花衣服，回去锁在箱子里，留着给女儿做嫁时衣。
    这些事例也说不尽。工商业者对于中国共产党和毛主席的爱戴，是从心底里发出来的，他们走社会主义道路的信心越来越坚定了。
  毛主席在1月25日最高国务会议上指示：“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。”这是毛主席分析了最近全国社会主义改造的形势作出来的结论，我们公认为是十分正确的。中国民主建国会真诚地拥护毛主席这一伟大的指示，我们一定要在党的领导下，发展组织，加强对会员的思想教育工作，团结和教育更多的工商业者，为彻底实现社会主义改造、实现毛主席的指示而奋斗。
      为此，中国民主建国会今后三年（1956年到1958年）的中心任务仍然是培养和提高工商界的骨干分子，要培养得好、而且要快、而且要多，拿来适应我国社会主义革命发展的形势和要求。在全行业合营的高潮以后，对于骨干分子的要求，有了很大的发展。决不能以为已经公私合营，就算万事大吉。社会主义革命还在前进，必须要求骨干分子带领着前进。在合营运动中立功，人民是一定记着的，但是运动又在发展，骨干分子如果不跟着前进，就会落在运动的后头。全业合营以后的基本任务：对企业说来，是进一步改造为社会主义企业，对工商业者说来，是进一步改造为放弃剥削、自食其力的劳动者。因此，今后的骨干分子的最重要的工作就是要协助政府完成上述的任务，不仅自己对这些问题要搞通思想，准备条件，而且要带动和帮助尽可能多的人搞通思想、准备条件，使最后完全以全民所有制代替资本家所有制的时候“瓜熟蒂落”“水到渠成”，也像这次公私合营高潮一样地更普遍地出现张灯结彩、敲锣打鼓的欢腾景象。
    这是必须做到的，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下也是一定能够做到的。
    自然，要圆满实现上述的要求，我们必须积极地、认真地做好一系列的工作，其中最重要的关键性的工作是学习。要组织和帮助骨干分子按照对企业、对人的进一步改造的要求学得又好、又快、又多，这就是我们中国民主建国会今后三年内的中心工作。
    学习的重要性，从工商界当前的情况观察，可以看得很明显。就以公私合营的运动为例吧，若干万的工商业者提出了申请，积极地参加了工作，这是一种社会主义觉悟的表现，可以肯定的。但是，究竟有多少人弄清楚了资本主义的剥削制度为什么一定要为社会主义制度所代替这个道理呢？怕还是一个大大的疑问吧！还有不少人没有认清剥削；对社会主义到底有什么好处，有些人也还弄不明白。客观形势在飞速地发展，因而工商界中这种认识落后于实际的情况，就显得或者将要显得格外突出。面对我们国家的社会主义革命大约再有三年的时间基本完成的历史任务，必须把这种情况很快地改变过来。在中国民主建国会来说，就是首先要在二、三年内帮助和教育会员一方面结合在企业中的实践进行个人改造，学会社会主义的经营管理方法，养成劳动习惯和劳动技能，另一方面通过马克思列宁主义的理论学习，联系实际，彻底批判掉资本主义的思想、建立社会主义的思想。同时本会还必须组织和帮助会员在工商界的思想改造和学习工作中保证发挥骨干的作用。上述的学习工作搞好了，这就是为工商界胜利地过社会主义的一关的时候，准备好最重要的条件。
    同志们！让我们努力学习，积极改造，准备胜利地过这一关吧！
    我还想附带地谈一谈关于知识分子的问题。我完全同意周恩来主席在政治报告中所提出：“最充分地动员和发挥现有知识分子的力量，不断地提高他们的政治觉悟和业务水平，大规模地培养新生力量来扩大他们的队伍，以适应国家对于知识分子的不断增长的要求”这个方针。周恩来主席指出：“帮助知识分子进行自我改造，对于充分动员和发挥知识分子力量，具有极其重大的意义。我国知识分子的大多数都已经或者正在站到社会主义方面来，但是他们中间许多人在思想和行动方面还不可避免地存在着不同程度的资产阶级观点和作风。”同志们！我也是一个知识分子，曾经在教育界工作30多年，对全国知识界有相当的联系，深深体会到知识分子的思想改造是一件艰巨的工作。我愿意和全国知识分子一道，努力学习马克思列宁主义，扫除思想上的资本主义、个人主义和唯心主义的影响。在过去6年来，知识分子在中国共产党的领导下对国家曾经有很大的贡献，今后将进一步团结在中国共产党的周围为我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大事业而奋斗。就中国民主建国会来说，会内也有不少知识分子，应该积极地投入这一斗争。另一方面，过去几年来会内和会外的知识分子对本会的宣传教育工作，如举办系统的政治理论学习、报告会和各种讲座等，曾经给予很大的帮助，希望今后继续地共同努力，而且还要加强努力。
    同志们！我们祖国的各项事业正在顺利地、迅速地进行，摆在我们面前的资本主义工商业社会主义改造的任务是多么光荣！多么伟大！我们一定要和全国人民一道完成这个任务，我们保证一定能够完成我们的任务！
