Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 18th: Shanxi Province has recently established large-scale demonstration zones for increased production of five major crops in various regions. These demonstration zones include cotton and wheat, distributed across the Jinnan and Jinzhong plains; corn and millet in four special districts, including Changzhi and Yuci; and potatoes in the areas north and south of the ancient Great Wall. In total, there are more than 10 million mu of land, accounting for approximately one-seventh of the province's sown area. This year, these crop production demonstration zones will universally adopt improved varieties, increase fertilizer application, implement rational close planting, and prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. The yield per mu is expected to increase by 10% compared to last year, and by 50% to 100% or more compared to other cultivated land this year.

A crop production demonstration work committee has been established at each level, from the special district to the township. Plans for the crop production demonstration zones are being formulated according to local conditions and adapting to local conditions. Many places have broken through the original plans. The 1.6 million mu of corn and other crops demonstration zone established in Changzhi and Yuci Special Districts will achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and the 200,000 mu of tuber crops will reach 1,000 to 3,000 jin per mu. Many counties in Jinnan and Changzhi Special Districts are also preparing to establish large-scale demonstration zones producing 1,000 jin of grain per mu, with "10,000 mu in each key point township, 1,000 mu in each township, and 100 mu in each cooperative." Currently, these demonstration zones have already begun preparations for increased production this year.

Establishing crop production demonstration zones at every level is an important measure taken by Shanxi Province after more than 90% of farmers joined the fully socialist agricultural cooperatives, to further increase production. These crop production demonstration zones will become the technical centers for agricultural production increase in rural areas. The state agricultural technology extension stations in each agricultural production demonstration zone will provide technical assistance and, during each agricultural season, will use methods such as organizing visits and imparting knowledge to disseminate the technical achievements and advanced experiences gained in the production demonstration zones to all surrounding agricultural production cooperatives.

    山西省建立农作物大面积增产示范区
    据新华社太原18日电　山西省最近在各地建立5种主要农作物的大面积增产示范区。这些增产示范区有分布在晋南、晋中平原上的棉花和小麦；长治、榆次等4个专区的玉米和谷子；还有古长城南北地带的马铃薯。总共有1，000多万亩土地，约占全省播种面积的七分之一。这些农作物增产示范区，今年将普遍采用优良品种、增施肥料、合理密植和防治病虫害等办法，每亩产量要比去年增产一成，比今年的其他耕地也将增产50％到100％以上。
    全省从专区到乡已经逐级建立了增产示范工作委员会。正在根据当地的具体条件，因地制宜地制定各种主要农作物增产示范区的方案。不少地方都突破了原订的计划。长治、榆次专区建立的160万亩玉米等作物的增产示范区，每亩平均产量要达到1，000斤，薯类20万亩每亩要达到1，000至3，000斤。晋南专区和长治专区的许多县还准备建立“每个基点乡1万亩、每个乡1，000亩，每个社100亩”的每亩产粮食1，000斤的大面积增产示范区。现在，这些增产示范区都已经开始了今年增产的准备工作。
    逐级普遍建立农作物增产示范区，是山西省90％以上的农户加入全社会主义的农业社以后，为进一步提高产量的一项重要措施。这些农作物增产示范区，将成为农村农业增产的技术中心。各个农业增产示范区里的国家农业技术推广站，将在技术上给予帮助，并且将在各个农事季节，采用组织参观和传授等办法，把增产示范区在技术上取得的成就和先进经验，传播给周围的所有农业生产合作社。
