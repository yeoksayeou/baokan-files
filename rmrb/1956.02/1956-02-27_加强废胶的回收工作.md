    Strengthen the Recycling of Waste Rubber

    In the past, about 80% of the rubber shoes produced by Shanghai's rubber factories used reclaimed rubber for the inner lining, and the quality was very good. However, since January of this year, many rubber factories in Shanghai have stopped using reclaimed rubber for the inner lining. It is estimated that this will result in the use of 40 tons more rubber per month than before, worth 200,000 yuan.

    Why are they no longer using reclaimed rubber for shoes? The reason is the lack of raw materials for reclaimed rubber; they are not collecting enough waste rubber. This is not to say that there is less waste rubber now than before, but that the purchasing work has not been done well. In the past, the vast majority of waste rubber was collected door-to-door by small vendors in various places. Now, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have not made good use of these small vendors. Some local supply and marketing cooperatives have set up waste material purchasing stations, squeezing out these small vendors, but they themselves do not collect door-to-door. It is hoped that the leaders of the supply and marketing cooperatives will pay attention to this issue in a timely manner and quickly strengthen the recycling of waste rubber.

    加强废胶的回收工作
    上海各橡胶厂生产的胶鞋中间有一块衬底，过去大约有80％的产品都是利用再生胶制成的，质量很好。但是，从今年1月份起，上海许多橡胶厂都不再用再生胶做衬底了，据估计，这样每月就要比过去多用40吨橡胶，值人民币20万元。
    为什么不用再生胶做鞋了呢？原因是再生胶的原料缺乏，收不到废胶。这当然不是说现在的废胶比过去少了，而是收购工作没有做好。以往的绝大部分废胶是小商贩在各地挨户收来的。现在各地供销合作社都没有把这些小商贩好好利用，有的地方供销合作社设立了废料收购站，把这些小商贩都挤掉了，自己又不挨户收购。希望供销合作社的领导上及时注意这个问题，迅速加强废胶的回收工作。
