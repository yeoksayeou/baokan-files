　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 12th: Polish newspapers reported: The two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Molotov and Eden, gave a note to the Polish People's Republic, a member of the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam, requesting opinions on the current situation in Vietnam and measures aimed at implementing the Geneva Accords. The Polish government issued a reply to this note through the Soviet and British embassies in Warsaw.

　　The Polish government's reply pointed out that the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning Vietnam have not been implemented satisfactorily. For example, the decisions regarding pre-election consultations and general elections have not been implemented, which were supposed to unify Vietnam on democratic principles through elections. The responsibility for the current situation should be borne by the South Vietnamese ruling clique, who have been trying to prevent the realization of the Geneva Accords from the beginning.

　　The note emphasized that the government of the Polish People's Republic, as a member of the International Supervisory and Control Commission, advocates convening a new conference on the Indochina issue to discuss the necessary measures in the current situation; and is prepared to participate in this conference as a member of the International Supervisory and Control Commission.

    波兰政府复照苏英两国政府
    建议召开新的会议讨论印度支那问题
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社华沙讯：波兰报纸报道：日内瓦会议的两位主席莫洛托夫和艾登曾就印度支那问题给了越南国际监督和监察委员会委员波兰人民共和国一个照会，要求就有关越南现有的局势和目的在于履行日内瓦协定的措施的问题提出意见。波兰政府通过苏联和英国驻华沙大使馆发出了对这一照会的复照。
    波兰政府的复照中指出，日内瓦协定有关越南的规定执行得不能令人满意。例如，有关选举前的协商和普选的决定就没有执行，而本来应当是通过选举使越南在民主原则上获得统一的。对现有局势的责任应当由南越统治集团担负，他们一开始就力图阻止日内瓦协定的实现。
    照会中强调指出，波兰人民共和国政府作为国际监督和监察委员会委员，主张就印度支那问题召开一次新的会议，讨论在当前的情况下必需的措施；并且准备以国际监督和监察委员会委员身份参加这一会议。
