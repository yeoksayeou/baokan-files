Sundry goods stores deal in a wide variety of goods, meeting the diverse needs of the people's lives, and many of these goods are not handled by state-owned commercial enterprises. After the public-private partnership, its operating characteristics should be maintained and developed.

In the Nanshi District of Shenyang City, there are 72 sundry goods stores and fixed stalls, 67 of which are concentrated near South Yijing Road and Shandong Temple Market. Citizens prefer to shop there. However, these vendors have little capital, small storefronts, and an incomplete range of goods, so consumers often have to go to all the shops to buy a satisfactory item.

After the implementation of the public-private partnership across the industry, the sundry goods industry in Nanshi District underwent preliminary economic reorganization, establishing a joint public-private sundry goods general store, including 7 stores composed of the original 72 vendors. These stores made full use of the original buildings and equipment, took into account consumer habits, and maintained the original operating characteristics. When selling goods, most commodities are still traded with "one hand pays the money, the other hand delivers the goods"; some commodities are also sourced in the same way as in the past. This has facilitated the surrounding masses, and the business of the stores has also developed. Sales have increased more than threefold compared to before the joint venture, and the number of goods sold has also increased by more than 100.

    保持下杂货商的特点
    下杂货商业经营品种多，适合群众生活多方面的需要，有许多是国营商业没有经营的。公私合营后，应该保持并且发扬它的经营特点。
    沈阳市南市区的下杂货业有72户座商和固定摊贩，其中67户集中在南一经路和山东庙市场附近，市民们都愿意到那里去买东西。但是这些商贩资金少，门面小，品种不全，消费者买件可心的东西往往要走遍所有的铺子。
    实行全行业公私合营以后，南市区的下杂货业进行了初步的经济改组，设立了公私合营下杂货业总店，包括由原来的72户商贩组成的7个门市部。这些门市部充分利用原有的房屋和设备，照顾了消费者的习惯，保持了原有的经营特点。卖货的时候，大部分商品仍然采取一手钱一手货的方法；有的商品也照过去的办法组织货源。这就便利了周围的群众，商店的业务也有了发展。卖钱额比合营前增加三倍多，经营的商品也增加了100多种。
