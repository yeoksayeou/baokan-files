Comrade Commissioners,

I am Huba Meng, a Huba Meng in religion. With the government's concern and care, my life and studies are going very well in all aspects.

In Xishuangbanna, there are 438 Buddhist temples and 48 ordination platforms.

The Bhikkhus and monks in Xishuangbanna also observe and learn the disciplines of religion. Now they are all free to believe in their own religions. They are very fond of learning Chinese and Dai languages. When it's time to learn Chinese, they go to learn Chinese. After school, they return to the Buddhist temples. They abide by both aspects very well.

After they have learned Chinese and Dai languages well, they are willing to go out and participate in work. Buddhism also permits them to participate in work.

In the past, their cultural level was very low, and they didn't understand anything. After several years of study, they have learned many things. Things they had never seen before, they have now seen with their own eyes.

Since we have the Party and Chairman Mao, everything in religion has been completely preserved in the same way, allowing us to freely believe in our own religion.

This also illustrates the "freedom of religious belief" in the Constitution. The Party and Chairman Mao allow all ethnic groups to freely believe in their own religions.

Our religious Bhikkhus and monks are now studying Chinese and Dai languages, also for the purpose of building a socialist society. Without the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups would never have today's happy life.

Now that I can speak at the conference, it is also inseparable from the Party and Chairman Mao. Now I feel very excited and honored!

After I return, I will do my best to assist the government in propaganda, so that a socialist society will arrive soon!

    祜巴勐的发言
    亲爱的委员同志们：
    我在宗教里当祜巴勐，有政府关心和照顾，我的生活和学习各方面都很好。
    在西双版纳内的佛寺，有438所，戒坛有48所。
    西双版纳的比丘和尚们，也都遵守和学习宗教里的纪律。现在他们都是自由的信仰自己的宗教。他们很喜欢学习汉文、傣文。到学习汉文的时间，他们就去学汉文。放学后，他们就回到佛寺。两方面他们遵守得很好。
    他们学好了汉文和傣文后，他们愿意出去参加工作。佛教里也准许他们参加工作去。
    过去，他们的文化水平很低，什么也不懂。经过几年来的学习，他们学会了很多东西。过去没有见过的东西，现在他们亲眼见到了。
    自从有了党和毛主席，宗教里的一切都是同样的完全保存着，让我们自己自由的信仰。
    这点，也就说明了宪法上的“宗教信仰自由”。党和毛主席让各族人民自由地信仰自己的宗教。
    我们宗教里的比丘和尚，现在他们学习汉文和傣文，也是为了建设社会主义社会。如果没有党和毛主席的英明领导，各族人民决不会有今天的幸福生活。
    现在我能在大会上发言，也是与党和毛主席分不开的。现在我感到很兴奋，很光荣！
    我回去后，要尽我的能力协助政府宣传，使社会主义社会早日到来！
