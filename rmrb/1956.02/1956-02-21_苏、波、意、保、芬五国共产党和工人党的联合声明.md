Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 20th - "People's Tribune," the organ of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, published the following statement on February 19th:

    "In 1938, the Executive Committee of the Communist International passed a resolution to dissolve the Polish Communist Party based on allegations made at the time that hostile elements had extensively infiltrated the leadership of the Polish Communist Party.

    It has now been ascertained that this accusation was based on materials fabricated by agents and provocateurs who were later exposed.

    After studying all the materials related to this issue, the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union, Italy, Bulgaria, and Finland, together with the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, have concluded that the dissolution of the Polish Communist Party was unjustified.

    The Executive Committee of the Communist International, in the aforementioned resolution, already pointed out the glorious revolutionary history of the heroic Polish proletariat and also emphasized that tens of thousands of Polish Communists had contributed their own and their entire lives to serve the cause of the working class and to defend the most vital interests of the working masses.

    Under the difficult circumstances of fascist terror, the Polish Communist Party led the Polish workers and peasants in the struggle against the oppression of capitalists and landlords, and for the social and national liberation of the working people. The Polish Communist Party inherited and continued the lofty tradition of the common revolutionary struggle of the Polish and Russian proletariat. It consistently stood on the position of proletarian internationalism, standing in close cooperation with fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties and with the international revolutionary movement.

    After the dissolution of the Communist Party, Polish Communists also actively engaged in the struggle against the fascist dictatorship of the Polish bourgeoisie and landlords and against the imminent danger of Nazi aggression, utilizing all organizational forms of the then existing workers' and peasants' mass movements.

    When Poland was invaded by Nazi troops, Polish Communists, together with left-wing socialists, stood at the forefront of the Polish people's anti-fascist liberation struggle.

    The Polish Workers' Party, established in 1942 by outstanding Polish Communist leaders, led extensive guerrilla activities of workers, peasants, and intellectuals against the Nazi aggressors and was the initiator of the establishment of the National People's Council. The struggle of the national democratic forces, headed by the Polish Workers' Party, under the conditions of the Soviet Union's historic victory over fascism, led to the birth of the People's Republic of Poland.

    In December 1948, the Polish Workers' Party merged with the Polish Socialist Party under the program of Marxism-Leninism, forming the Polish United Workers' Party, which is now a fighting and united Marxist-Leninist party—the leading force in the struggle of the working masses of People's Poland to build socialism.

### 苏、波、意、保、芬五国共产党和工人党的联合声明

    苏、波、意、保、芬五国共产党和工人党的联合声明
    新华社华沙20日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会机关报“人民论坛报”2月19日刊登了下列的声明：
    “1938年，共产国际执行委员会通过了一项根据当时所提出来的关于敌对分子已经广泛地渗入波兰共产党的领导队伍中的指责而解散波兰共产党的决议。
    现在查明，这种指责所根据的是在后来被揭发了的特务分子和挑衅分子所捏造的材料。
    在研究了有关这一问题的全部材料以后，苏联、意大利、保加利亚和芬兰等国共产党中央委员会同波兰统一工人党中央委员会一起得出了这样的结论：解散波兰共产党是没有理由的。
    共产国际执行委员会在上述决议中就已经指出了英勇的波兰无产阶级过去光荣的革命历史，并且还强调指出：成千成万的波兰共产党人贡献了自己和他们的全部生命，来为工人阶级的事业和保卫劳动群众最切身的利益的事业服务。
    在法西斯恐怖的困难情况下，波兰共产党领导波兰工人和农民进行反对资本家和地主的压迫、争取劳动人民的社会解放和民族解放的斗争。波兰共产党继承并且延续了波兰和俄国无产阶级共同进行革命斗争的崇高传统，它一贯站在无产阶级国际主义的立场上，站在同兄弟共产党和工人党、同国际革命运动紧密合作的立场上。
    波兰共产党人在共产党解散之后还利用当时存在的工人和农民群众运动的一切组织形式，积极进行反对波兰资产阶级和地主的法西斯独裁政权、反对迫在眉睫的纳粹侵略危险的斗争。
    当波兰遭到纳粹军队入侵的时候，波兰共产党人和左翼社会党人一起，站在波兰人民反法西斯的解放斗争的最前列。
    由卓越的波兰共产党领袖们在1942年建立的波兰工人党，领导了反对纳粹侵略者的工人、农民和知识分子的广泛的游击活动，而且是成立人民代表会议的倡议者。以波兰工人党为首的全国民主力量的斗争在苏联对法西斯主义的历史性胜利的条件下导致了波兰人民共和国的诞生。
    1948年12月，波兰工人党在马克思列宁主义纲领下同波兰社会党合并，成立了波兰统一工人党，现在波兰统一工人党是战斗的和统一的马克思列宁主义政党——人民波兰的劳动群众建设社会主义斗争中的领导力量。
