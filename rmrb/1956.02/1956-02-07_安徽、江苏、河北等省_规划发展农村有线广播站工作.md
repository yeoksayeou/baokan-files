    Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei and other provinces
    Plan to develop rural wired broadcasting stations
    The preliminary plan for developing the rural wired broadcasting network formulated by Anhui Province requires that before the end of 1957, a rural wired broadcasting station should be established in each of the 68 counties and the suburbs of 6 cities in the province. Using the original district and township telephone lines as trunk lines, erect necessary broadcasting branch lines, and install 42,000 loudspeakers in districts, townships, and agricultural production cooperatives, so that larger agricultural production cooperatives and villages will be equipped with loudspeakers. Within this year, 40 new broadcasting stations will be built first, and the 8 stations already established last year will be expanded. During the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, loudspeakers will be installed in every production team of the cooperative. During the period of the Third Five-Year Plan, dedicated broadcasting trunk lines and broadcasting stations in districts and large agricultural cooperatives will be gradually established. At that time, more than a quarter of the farmers in the province will have loudspeakers. At the same time, rural radio stations will also be developed. Before 1962, each cooperative will have a radio, and large cooperatives will have two to three radios.

    The plan for developing the rural broadcasting network made by the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee requires that by the end of this year, rural wired broadcasting stations should be established in every county and the suburbs of cities under the jurisdiction of the province. By 1957, the number of wired broadcasting loudspeakers in the province can be developed to 98,000 to 129,000, basically achieving the goal of having loudspeakers in every village. By 1958, every cooperative will have loudspeakers. Jiangning County, the suburbs of Nanjing City, and Jiangpu County can achieve the goal of having loudspeakers in every cooperative this year. By 1962, the number of wired broadcasting loudspeakers in the province can be developed to 366,000 to 480,000.

    In Hebei Province, in addition to the three counties of Changli, Zhuozhou, and Pingquan, which have already established wired broadcasting stations, the remaining 150 counties will universally establish wired broadcasting stations this year in four batches. Each station will be equipped with a 1,000-watt amplifier, and the broadcasting lines will first reach the townships using telephone lines. In the next two years, the lines of each broadcasting station will also be extended to the villages, so that every village and cooperative can hear the broadcast. By 1958, there will be 188,000 loudspeakers in rural areas. From 1959, broadcasting stations will be established in townships or larger agricultural production cooperatives as a priority, each station equipped with a 250-watt amplifier. By 1962, there will be 648,000 loudspeakers in rural areas of the province, achieving the goal of having one loudspeaker for each residential group.

    安徽、江苏、河北等省
    规划发展农村有线广播站工作
    安徽省制定的发展农村有线广播网的初步规划要求：1957年年底以前，要在全省68个县和6个市的郊区，各建立一座农村有线广播站，利用原有的区乡电话线做干线，架设必要的广播支线，在区、乡及农业生产合作社安装42，000个喇叭，使较大的农业生产合作社和村庄都挂上喇叭。在今年一年内，将先新建40个广播站，扩建去年已经建立的8个站。在第二个五年计划期间，每个社的生产队都装上喇叭。在第三个五年计划期间，将逐步建立起广播专用干线以及区和大的农业合作社的传播站。这时，全省将有四分之一以上的农户都装有喇叭。同时还要发展农村收音站，1962年以前，使每个合作社都有一部收音机，大社有两部到三部收音机。

    江苏省人民委员会作出的发展农村广播网的规划要求，到今年年底，在每一个县和省辖市的郊区都建立起农村有线广播站，到1957年全省有线广播喇叭可以发展到98，000只到129，000只，基本上达到村村有喇叭。1958年达到社社有喇叭。江宁县，南京市郊区和江浦县，今年就可以达到社社有喇叭。到1962年全省有线广播喇叭可以发展到366，000只到48万只。

    河北省除已经建立有线广播站的昌黎、涿县、平泉3县外，其余的150个县都将在今年分4批普遍地建立起有线广播站，每站设1，000瓦扩音机一部，利用电话线路使广播线路首先到达乡。明后两年，各广播站的线路还要延长到村，达到村村社社都能听到广播。到1958年，农村将有188，000只喇叭。从1959年开始在乡或较大的农业生产合作社重点建立广播站，每站设250瓦扩音机一部。到1962年，全省农村将有648，000只喇叭，达到每个居民组有一只喇叭。
