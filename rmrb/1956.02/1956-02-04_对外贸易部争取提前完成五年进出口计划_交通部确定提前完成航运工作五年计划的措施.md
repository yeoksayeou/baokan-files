    The Ministry of Communications Determines Measures to Complete the Five-Year Shipping Plan Ahead of Schedule

    This newspaper reports that the Ministry of Foreign Trade held a national conference of directors and commissioners of foreign trade bureaus in late January. Based on the new situation of the high tide of socialist revolution in the country, the conference reviewed the foreign trade work in 1955, arranged the work for 1956, and proposed and initially studied a draft of the long-term development plan for foreign trade during the Second Five-Year Plan.

    The conference believes that in order to meet the needs of the development of the domestic and international situation, foreign trade must be comprehensively improved based on the central government's guidelines and policies on foreign trade, on the basis of opposing conservatism, comprehensive planning, and strengthening leadership, so as to reach the scientific level of international foreign trade within the next 12 years, in order to complete foreign trade tasks more, faster, better, and more economically, to support the country's socialist construction. Participants unanimously agreed to strive to complete the national import and export plan in the first Five-Year Plan six months ahead of schedule, that is, before the end of June 1957.

    The conference believes that doing a good job in organizing export goods, improving the quality of export commodities, and ensuring the completion of the export plan are the keys to ensuring the completion of the import plan. Therefore, the conference focused on studying the offices, organizations, and tasks of the commissioners of various provinces and cities.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Ministry of Communications held a national shipping work conference from January 17 to 28 to study and determine measures to ensure the completion of the five-year shipping work plan ahead of schedule; at the same time, it studied the comprehensive plan for the shipping industry up to 1967 and strengthened the leadership of local shipping work.

    The conference believes that the main basis for completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule is to tap potential, overcome the shortcomings in the current work, and give full play to the efficiency of existing ships. The conference also decided to complete the joint state-private ownership of the capitalist steamship industry in 1956, and basically complete the semi-socialist cooperativization of wooden sailing ships.
