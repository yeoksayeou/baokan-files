Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 5th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter recently interviewed 15 Chinese students who had studied in the United States and 30 overseas Chinese who had traveled in the United States, after they returned to the motherland via Hong Kong on February 1st. They expressed deep emotion regarding the warm welcome they received in Shenzhen and Guangzhou from representatives of the Higher Education Department and the Guangzhou Education Bureau, as well as the new atmosphere in the motherland. Liu Yongming, a student who had studied in the United States, was detained in a refugee camp in Hong Kong while passing through Hong Kong.
    Dr. He Binglin, who studied organic chemistry at Indiana University in the United States, said: "When we crossed the Shenzhen border, my wife and I felt the amiable new spirit of our new China. The people in Shenzhen helped take care of us and our two children during our rest. A comrade from China Travel Service personally carried our luggage for us. This has never been seen in past China."
    Dr. Lin Yi, an organic chemist who studied in Pennsylvania, said: "I was so happy to hear that the Chinese Academy of Sciences currently has 40 research institutions. I have been engaged in research work for many years. I used to be afraid that China had none or only a few research institutions." He added: "People are the driving force of national construction. We feel that every Chinese person is now full of strength." He continued, "Three days ago, my wife specially rushed from Fuzhou to Guangzhou to meet me. Before liberation, she was a housewife. Now she is a teacher at Fuzhou No. 2 Middle School. Her knowledge has greatly improved, and her interests are wider than before. She has become a vibrant person."
    Several students said that although they were determined to return to their motherland, they still felt some apprehension on the way back, mainly because they had lived in the United States for too long. Dr. Zhang Yingbo, who studied at Michigan State University, told reporters, "My apprehension disappeared immediately after returning to China. I am very happy."
    The reporter asked Dr. Shen Zhirong, who studied applied mechanics at Harvard University, whether many Chinese students in the United States wanted to return to their motherland. He said, "Due to the vicious means adopted by the US government for a long time, many Chinese students are afraid of the difficulties created by the US authorities in order to prevent them from returning to China. Especially in small cities, Chinese students know that if they intend to return to China but cannot leave, they will encounter trouble in their work and daily life." He added, "Liu Yongming's incident is a clear example of the US authorities being prepared to create trouble at any time in order to prevent Chinese students from returning to China."

    近日归国的留美学生谈回到祖国观感
    新华社广州5日电　新华社记者连日访问了2月1日经过香港回到祖国的15名我国留美学生和30名旅美华侨。他们对于在深圳和广州受到高等教育部和广州市教育局代表的热烈欢迎和对祖国的新气象表示深为感动。留美学生刘永铭在经过香港时被拘留在香港难民营中。
    在美国印第安纳大学研究有机化学的何炳林博士说：“在我们走过了深圳边境的时候，我的爱人和我感到我们新中国可亲的新精神。在深圳的人民在我们休息的时候帮助照顾我们和我们的两个小孩。中国旅行社的一位同志亲自为我们搬行李。这是在过去的中国从来没有见过的。”
    一位有机化学家，曾经在宾夕法尼亚学习的林一博士说：“在听到中国科学院目前有40个研究机构的时候，我感到太高兴了。我从事研究工作已有多年。我过去就怕中国根本没有或者只有少数几个研究机构。”他又说：“人是国家建设的动力。我们感到现在每个中国人都充满力量。”他继续说，“三天前我的爱人特地从福州赶到广州来迎接我。在解放以前，她还是一个家庭妇女。现在她已经是福州第二中学的教员。她的知识已经大为提高，兴趣也比较以前更为广泛，她已经变成一个充满活力的人。”
    有几位留学生说，虽然他们决心返回祖国，但在回国途中心里仍不免有些疑惧，原因主要是他们在美国住得太久了。曾在密执安州立大学读书的张英伯博士对记者说，“回国后我的疑惧马上就消失了。我感到非常高兴。”
    记者问曾经在哈佛大学研究应用力学的沈志荣博士，在美国的中国留学生是不是很多都想回到祖国来。他说，“由于美国政府长期以来所采取的恶毒手段，许多中国留学生对美国当局为了要阻挠他们回国而造成的种种困难心存恐惧。特别是在小城市里，中国留学生都知道，假如他们打算回国而又走不了的话，他们在工作上和日常生活中就会碰到麻烦。”他又说，“刘永铭的事件就是美国当局为了阻止中国留学生回国，时刻都准备制造麻烦的一个显明的例子。”
