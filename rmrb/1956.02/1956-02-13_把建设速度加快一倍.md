Double the speed of factory and mine construction - what a meaningful thing that is! The Huainan Coal Mine is now doing just that.

In the past, it generally took 60 months (i.e., 5 years) to build a pair of mine shafts with an annual output of 900,000 tons of coal in our country, but the Xiejiaji No. 2 and No. 3 shafts of the Huainan Coal Mine, which are under construction, can be handed over for production in 28 months.

In the design, it is stipulated that these two pairs of mine shafts should be completed in 30 months. The reason for stipulating such a short time is not only because the geological conditions here are good, and the construction standards and the degree of mechanization are designed according to the principle of spending less money and achieving quick results, but also because the design includes indicators to encourage people to give play to their initiative and enthusiasm: the monthly progress of the shaft is required to be 19% higher than the national average; the monthly progress of the roadway is required to be 28% higher than the national average; and the monthly progress of the underground coal bunker is also higher than the national average. This is a speed that breaks with convention. Many people have doubted this plan, and some of the people responsible for the construction of these two pairs of mine shafts did not have the confidence to complete the plan before the third quarter of 1955. The fact now before people is that the two pairs of mine shafts will be handed over for production on July 1 this year, and the construction time will be shorter than originally planned. This is a useful lesson for those with conservative ideas.

In order to ensure the timely completion of the construction plan of these two pairs of mine shafts, the Huainan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held three special meetings in 1955, on the one hand, to balance various construction projects and determine the progress; on the other hand, to focus on criticizing the conservative ideas of relevant cadres, and requiring both parties, A and B, to complete the national plan, and unify the thoughts and goals of the cadres of both parties, A and B. The leaders of Party A changed their leadership methods, went deep into the front line, and led relevant business personnel and engineering and technical personnel to the construction site to work jointly with Party B. The leaders of both parties, A and B, personally grasped the actual situation of the construction site, and problems could be solved quickly. In the past, when both parties, A and B, were in the same city, Party B would have to write official documents when problems arose in the construction, and it would have to go through many levels before it could be transferred to the person in charge of Party A, and some were even not transferred at all. After the implementation of joint office work, this phenomenon disappeared. Regarding drawings, materials and equipment, Party A sometimes did not dare to solve problems because they did not understand the specific situation, and told the Beijing design unit, and many small problems had to be delayed for a long time before they could be solved. Now, both parties, A and B, jointly organize forces to carefully study the problems found and take appropriate measures. For example, if the specifications of the previously ordered equipment were not suitable, more than 100 kinds of substitutes were used after on-the-spot research by both parties, on the premise of ensuring quality. After Party A understood the construction situation, it took the initiative to create construction conditions for Party B. Generally, it takes three months to prepare for construction after the drawings arrive, but now it only takes one month, or even less than one month, to start construction. When the project was tight in December last year, Party A transferred more than 100 technicians from the production mine to support Party B's construction.

The chief engineer of the Huainan Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau said: "In construction, we are not afraid of being slow, but we are afraid of stopping. An important reason why our project is progressing faster is that the project has never stopped." Why are they able to avoid stopping work in the complicated mine construction work? This is because they have mastered the leadership method of overall planning. Under the leadership of the Huainan Municipal Committee, both parties, A and B, arranged the entire construction work from the beginning, and studied the time for handing over production as early as possible. This gave the builders a goal to strive for. In May and September 1955, both parties made a comprehensive arrangement of work according to the progress of the construction. Party B also made specific arrangements for each month's work according to the overall project plan. In the fourth quarter of last year, even the work done every hour was arranged in the plan. This comprehensive planning and specific arrangement is actually the specific organization and inspection of work by leading cadres, and the key problems in construction can be found through comprehensive arrangement. For example, after a comprehensive arrangement in the second half of 1955, Party B determined that the key to completing the task was to complete the installation project. In order to cooperate with Party B in completing the task, Party A jointly reviewed the installation project drawings with Party B, and found equipment that did not meet the specifications. Both parties promptly transferred personnel to solve it; at the same time, Party B immediately organized installation forces to implement parallel flow operation and cross operation to speed up the progress, so that the installation task was successfully completed. When making a comprehensive arrangement for the construction of Xiejiaji No. 3 shaft in 1955, it was found that the roadway layout work in the No. 11 coal seam mining area was lagging behind, so they decided to open two inclined shafts from the ground to the No. 11 coal seam. As a result, it cost less money and could be handed over for production three months earlier. Party B did not include the installation of the wellhead screening equipment of Xiejiaji No. 3 shaft in the 1955 plan. In the overall plan, it was proved that it was possible to start construction ahead of schedule, and Party A actively assisted Party B in studying the construction method, and the construction was also started ahead of schedule. Comprehensive planning and frequent and meticulous arrangement of work can enable leaders to thoroughly grasp the construction conditions, rationally organize manpower and material resources, closely connect various tasks, create conditions for each other, and overcome the factors of stopping work and waiting for work.

Adopting advanced construction methods in construction is also the most effective way to speed up construction. Originally, when installing equipment in the auxiliary shaft, it was impossible to transport the gangue exploited underground at the same time, and the underground exploitation work had to be stopped. Now, the construction unit connects the main and auxiliary shafts. When installing equipment in the auxiliary shaft, it uses the main shaft to transport gangue; when installing equipment in the main shaft, it uses the auxiliary shaft to transport gangue, thereby speeding up the construction. In terms of roadway excavation, these two pairs of mine shafts adopted the method of simultaneous relative exploitation from the main and auxiliary shafts and the inclined shafts on both wings, which saved 16 months of roadway excavation and coal mining face layout time compared with exploitation only from the main and auxiliary shafts, and the speed was doubled. When exploiting roadways, if a large amount of gangue is lifted from the underground, the exploitation progress can be accelerated. In the construction of these two pairs of mine shafts, the workers of the construction unit proposed a method of using temporary double-hook cages instead of small-capacity buckets in the main shaft, which increased the lifting capacity of gangue by one and a half times, and the daily roadway excavation was increased by 12 meters compared with using buckets. In the past, the installation of the headframe was carried out piece by piece at the wellhead, which affected the progress of other projects at the wellhead. Now, it has been changed to the method of integral installation next to the well, which not only speeds up the installation time of the headframe by thirty or forty days, but also allows other projects at the wellhead to be carried out simultaneously. The workers also improved the construction method when building the headframe foundation ring, saving more than ten days of construction time.

Because these two pairs of mine shafts speed up the construction by improving the leadership method and construction method, the project cost has been reduced and the quality has been guaranteed. The experience of these two pairs of mine shafts is worth learning from all basic construction units.

    把建设速度加快一倍
    本报记者　于明
    把厂、矿建设的速度加快一倍，这是一件多么有意义的事情！淮南煤矿现在正在这样做。
    过去，我国建设一对年产90万吨煤的矿井，一般需要60个月（即5年），而正在建设中的淮南煤矿谢家集二号井和三号井都能在28个月移交生产。
    在设计中，规定这两对矿井都要在30个月建成。规定这样短的时间，除了因为这里地质条件较好，建设标准、机械化程度等是按照花钱少收效快的原则设计的外，还因为在设计中就包括了鼓励人们发挥主动性、积极性的指标：井筒的月进度要求比全国平均的进度提高19％；巷道的月进度要求比全国平均的月进度提高28％；井下煤仓的月进度也高於全国平均的进度。这是打破常规的速度。不少人曾怀疑过这个计划，负责建设这两对矿井的某些人，在1955年第三季度以前，也没有完成计划的信心。现在摆在人们面前的事实是：两对矿井将在今年7月1日移交生产，建设的时间比原设计规定的还要短。这对于那些有保守思想的人，是一个有益的教训。
    为了保证这两对矿井的建设计划按时完成，中共淮南市委在1955年召开了三次专门会议，一面平衡各种施工项目，确定进度；一面着重批判有关干部的保守思想，要求甲乙双方必须完成国家计划，把甲、乙双方的干部思想、目标统一起来。甲方的领导人员改变了领导方法，深入现场，并且带领有关的业务人员和工程技术人员，到工地去和乙方实行联合办公。甲、乙双方领导人员都亲自掌握工地的实际情况，有问题就能迅速解决。过去，甲乙双方在一个市内，乙方在施工中有了问题，还要写成公文，经过许多层次才能转到甲方负责人手里，有的甚至根本转不到。实行联合办公后，这种现象没有了。在图纸、器材和设备方面，过去有了问题，甲方有时因为不了解具体情况，不敢解决，而转告北京设计单位，许多小问题都要拖很长时间才能解决。现在，甲乙双方共同组织力量，慎重研究所发现的问题，采取适当措施。如以前订购的器材规格不合，经过双方就地研究，在保证质量的前提下，换用代用品的就有100多种。甲方了解了施工情况以后，就主动为乙方创造施工条件，一般工程在图纸到来以后还要准备三个月才能施工，现在只要一个月，甚至不到一个月就可开工。去年12月工程紧张的时候，甲方从生产矿中抽调100多个技术工人支援乙方施工。
    淮南煤矿基本建设局的总工程师说：“在施工中，不怕慢，就怕站。我们的工程所以进度较快，一个很重要的原因，就是工程没有停歇过。”他们为什么能在错综复杂的矿井建设工作中，做到不停工呢？这是因为他们掌握了全面规划的领导方法。甲、乙双方在淮南市委领导下，一开始就把整个建设工作加以安排，研究了尽可能提早移交生产的时间。这就使建设者有了奋斗的目标。1955年5月和9月，双方又根据施工进行的情况全面安排一次工作。乙方又根据工程总规划具体安排每一个月的工作，在去年第四季度，甚至把每个小时所做的工作都在计划里加以安排。这样全面规划，具体安排，实际上就是领导干部具体组织和检查工作，可以通过全面安排找出建设中的关键问题。如1955年下半年经过全面安排，乙方确定了完成任务的关键在于完成安装工程。甲方为了配合乙方完成任务，就同乙方共同会审安装工程图纸，发现了不合规格的设备，双方就及时抽调人员加以解决；同时乙方立即组织安装力量，实行平行流水作业和交叉作业，加快进度，使安装任务胜利完成。1955年全面安排谢家集三号井施工工作的时候，发现北部十一号煤层采区的巷道布置工作落后了，他们便决定由地面到十一号煤层间开两个斜井。结果花钱不多，又能提早三个月移交生产。谢家集三号井的井口筛选设备安装，乙方没有列入1955年计划。在全面规划中证明它是有可能提前施工的，甲方就积极协助乙方研究施工方法，结果也提前施工了。全面规划和经常细致地安排工作，就可以使领导人员彻底掌握施工条件，合理地组织人力物力，使各种工作紧密衔接，彼此创造条件，克服停工窝工的因素。
    在施工中采用先进的施工方法，也是加快建设速度的最有效办法。原来在副井安装设备的时候，就不能同时把井下开拓出来的矸子运出来，井下的开拓工作就要停下来。现在施工单位把主、副井打通，在副井安装设备的时候，就利用主井运矸子；主井安装设备的时候，就利用副井运矸子，从而加快了建设速度。在巷道掘进方面，这两对矿井采取了由主井副井和两翼斜井同时相对开拓的方法，使巷道掘进和采煤掌子面的布置时间，比只从主、副井开拓，节省了16个月，速度加快了一倍。在开拓巷道的时候，如果把井下的矸子大量提绞上来，就可加快开拓进度。在建设这两对矿井中，施工单位的职工们，提出了在主井中用临时双钩罐笼代替装载量很小的吊桶的办法，把提绞矸子的能力提高了一倍半，每天巷道掘进要比用吊桶时增加12公尺。井架的安装，过去是在井口一件件地安，影响井口其他工程的进行，现在改变为在井旁整体安装的方法，不但把井架的安装时间加快了三、四十天，而且可以使井口其他工程同时进行。工人们在筑井架基础圈的时候也改进了施工方法，节省了十几天的施工时间。
    因为这两对矿井是从改进领导方法和施工方法上加快建设速度的，工程成本都有所降低，质量也得到保证。这两对矿井的经验是值得一切基本建设单位学习的。
