    The Nèi-Kūn Railway, Constructed Ahead of Schedule
    By our reporter Lǐ Cè
    Recently, while busily constructing the Bǎo-Chéng Railway, the Second Engineering Bureau of New Railway Construction also accepted the glorious task of constructing the Nèi (Jiāng)-Kūn (míng) Railway ahead of schedule. This railway was originally planned for construction during the Second Five-Year Plan, but now the state requires it to be open to traffic within three to four years.
    The route of the Nèi-Kūn Railway runs southwest from the Nèijiāng Station on the Chéng-Yú Railway, passes through the salt district of Zìgòng City, reaches Yíbīn on the banks of the Yangtze River, then crosses the Yangtze River, passes south through Yánjīn, crosses the Lóushān Mountains on the border of Guizhou and Yunnan, reaches Zhānyì in Yunnan, and then follows the Xú-Kūn line to Kūnmíng. The entire line is approximately 700 kilometers long.
    Once this railway is completed, it will directly connect Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and also link parts of Guizhou. People living in Kūnmíng, taking a train north, can reach the coastal provinces of the motherland via the Nèi-Kūn, Bǎo-Chéng, and Lǒng-Hǎi Railways; they can reach the border regions of the northwest via the Nèi-Kūn, Bǎo-Chéng, and Tiān-Lán Railways. In the future, grain from southern Sichuan, salt from Zìgòng, sugar from Nèijiāng, paper from Yíbīn, and apatite from Éméi can be transported in large quantities from the Nèi-Kūn Railway to many minority areas in the southwest to support the production and cultural construction of the local fraternal ethnic groups. Native products from the fraternal ethnic regions can also be exported in large quantities via the Nèi-Kūn Railway. More importantly, the opening of the Nèi-Kūn Railway will greatly assist the construction of the famous Gègejiù tin mine and Yunnan's hydropower stations, metallurgical industries, and other industrial projects. After the entire Diān-Yuè Railway is restored, the Nèi-Kūn Railway will also be an international transportation line from southwestern China to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It will have a positive effect on promoting the common economic prosperity and cultural exchange between China and Vietnam.
    The engineering of this railway is relatively arduous. Except for the section from Nèijiāng to Yíbīn, which is relatively flat hilly terrain, the entire line from Yíbīn south to Kūnmíng must pass through countless high mountains, ridges, and rapid rivers. The tunnels in the Lóushān Mountains and the Yíbīn Yangtze River Bridge are two key projects of the entire line. The Qínlǐng tunnel and Jiālíng River bridge projects on the Bǎo-Chéng line cannot be compared to them. Currently, designers are trying to find a shorter tunnel at Huāhóngyuán and a better bridge site for the Yangtze River Bridge on the Yíbīn riverbank. This can shorten the construction period of the entire line.
    The design and construction personnel responsible for the Nèi-Kūn Railway unanimously believe that this railway can be opened to traffic within 3 years, i.e., by the end of 1958. Zhāng Dáyōng, an engineer at the Southwest Design Branch of the Ministry of Railways, said: Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the technical level of the designers has improved, and their experience has become richer over the past few years. Previously, determining a railway line required three steps: preliminary survey, initial survey, and detailed survey. Soviet experts, based on the specific circumstances of road construction in our country, proposed the method of on-site alignment, allowing designers to directly conduct initial surveys without preliminary surveys, and detailed surveys without initial surveys, based on the specific on-site conditions. Parallel and continuous operations were implemented for design and construction, with drawings being submitted in batches. For example, the design of a tunnel can begin excavation after the center line and elevation are determined, and then other parts can be designed. For bridge design, the bridge foundation part can be submitted first for excavation, followed by other design documents in succession. This greatly speeds up the construction progress. In terms of construction, Comrade Liáng Xùdōng, head of the Planning and Statistics Department of the Second Engineering Bureau, said: Constructing the Nèi-Kūn Railway has more favorable conditions than the Bǎo-Chéng Railway. The southwest has abundant labor, and there are no problems with the supply of construction materials such as sleepers and cement, as well as food, vegetables, and daily necessities. The Sichuan-Yunnan Highway is available for transportation along the line. The terrain of the entire line is flatter than the Bǎo-Chéng line, and the climate is mild, allowing for uninterrupted construction throughout the year. In terms of the growth of construction technical strength, the labor productivity of the bureau's employees in 1955 increased by 28% compared to 1954, and it is expected to increase significantly this year. More importantly, this railway has been long-awaited by the people of the southwest, and any difficulties in construction will receive enthusiastic support from the local Party organizations, governments, and the broad masses of people.
    Currently, the construction survey work for the Nèijiāng-Yíbīn section was completed last December. In early January of this year, personnel from the two road construction engineering sections were successively transferred from the Bǎo-Chéng line to start building temporary sheds and measuring construction access roads, and construction will begin within February. The key project of the Fǔxī River Bridge in Zìgòng City will have its foundation engineering completed before the flood season in May. The Nèi-Yí section is more than 110 kilometers long, and it is planned to lay tracks starting from Nèijiāng Station this year. Under the enthusiastic encouragement of building socialism and constructing the Nèi-Kūn Railway ahead of schedule, all employees of the bureau are striving to lay more tracks and aim to lay them to the banks of the Yangtze River in Yíbīn by the end of the year.
    In order to support the construction of the Nèi-Kūn Railway, the Party and government organs of the Nèijiāng and Yíbīn Special Zones and Zìgòng City convened local grain, commerce, transportation, and other departments to arrange various tasks to support railway construction and mobilized agricultural production cooperatives along the line to expand their plans for planting vegetables and raising pigs to ensure the needs of the road construction workers.

### 提前建设的内昆铁路

    提前建设的内昆铁路
    本报记者　李策
    最近，在紧张地修建宝成铁路的同时，新建铁路第二工程局又接受了提前建设内
  （江）昆（明）铁路的光荣任务。这条铁路原来是计划在第二个五年计划内修建的，现在国家要求在三、四年内就通车。
    内昆铁路的线路，是从成渝铁路的内江车站折向西南，穿过自贡市的盐区，到长江岸边的宜宾，然后跨过长江，往南经过盐津，翻过贵州和云南交界的娄山山脉，到达云南的沾益，再沿着叙昆的线路到昆明。全线约有700多公里。
    这条铁路建成以后，将直接连结四川和云南两省，并且沟通贵州的部分地区。住在昆明的人搭上北上的火车，经过内昆、宝成、陇海铁路，可以到祖国沿海各省；经过内昆、宝成、天兰铁路，可以到祖国西北的边疆各地。将来，川南的粮食、自贡的盐、内江的糖、宜宾的纸、峨嵋的磷灰石，都可以从内昆路大量地运到西南的许多少数民族地区，支援当地兄弟民族的生产和文化建设事业。兄弟民族地区的土特产也可以从内昆铁路大量输出。更重要的是，内昆铁路通车以后，对著名的个旧锡矿和云南的水力发电站，冶金等项工业建设，都有很大的帮助。滇越铁路全部修复以后，内昆铁路也将是从我国西南通往越南民主共和国的一条国际交通线。它对促进中越两国共同的经济繁荣和文化交流，会发生良好的作用。
    这条铁路的工程是比较艰巨的。全线除了内江至宜宾一段是比较平坦的丘陵山地以外，从宜宾以南到昆明，要经过无数的高山大岭和湍急的河流。娄山山脉上的隧道和宜宾长江大桥，是全线两项重点工程。宝成线的秦岭隧道和嘉陵江桥梁工程都不能和它们相比。现在设计人员正在设法在花红园寻找一条较短的隧道，在宜宾江岸寻找一个更好的长江大桥桥位。这样可以缩短全线工程的修建日期。
    负责内昆铁路的设计、施工人员，一致认为这条铁路有可能在3年内，即在1958年年底通车。铁道部西南设计分局工程师张达庸说：设计人员几年来在苏联专家的指导下，技术水平提高了，经验丰富了。以前确定一条铁路，要经过草测、初测、定测三个步骤，苏联专家根据我国筑路的具体情况，提出现场定线办法，设计人员根据现场具体情况，可以不经过草测的就直接初测；可以不初测的就直接定测。设计和施工实行了平行流水作业法，采取分批交出图纸办法。例如，隧道的设计，在定出中线、标高以后就可以开挖，然后再设计其他部分。桥梁的设计，可以先交出桥基部分，进行开挖，再陆续交出其他设计文件。这样就大大加快了施工进度。在施工方面，第二工程局计划统计处长梁旭东同志说：修建内昆铁路比宝成铁路有更多的有利条件。西南有的是劳动力，枕木、水泥等建筑材料和粮食、菜蔬、日用品等生活物资的供应也没问题。沿线有川滇公路可供运输。全线地势比宝成线平坦，气候温和，可以全年不间断地施工。在施工技术力量成长方面，全局职工1955年的劳动生产率比1954年提高了28％，预计今年还可以大大提高。更重要的是，这条铁路是西南人民盼望很久的，施工中的任何困难，都会得到当地党组织、政府和广大人民的热情支援。
    现在，内江至宜宾段的施工调查工作已经在去年12月结束。今年1月初两个筑路工程段的人员，已经陆续从宝成线上调来，开始修建临时工棚，测量施工便道，将要在2月份内施工。自贡市釜溪河桥梁重点工程，将要在5月份洪水期以前做好桥基工程。内宜段共长110多公里，今年计划从内江车站起铺轨。全局职工在建设社会主义，提前修筑内昆铁路的热情鼓舞下，争取多铺，年底要铺到宜宾长江岸边。
    为了支援内昆铁路的修建，内江、宜宾专区和自贡市党、政机关召集当地粮食、商业、交通运输等部门，安排了支援铁路建设的各项工作，并且发动沿线农业生产合作社扩大种植蔬菜和养猪计划，以保证筑路员工的需要。
