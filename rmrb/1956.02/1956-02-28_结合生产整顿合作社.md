Xinhua News Agency report:
In late February, the more than 20,000 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Hubei Province generally began rectification. Xiangyang and Xiaogan prefectures, which started rectification work earlier, have implemented the system of contracting work and output in more than 30% of their cooperatives. This rectification work is being carried out by organizing production, and within the context of production. In many areas, the implementation of the system of contracting work and output during the rectification process has led to an unprecedented level of labor utilization. The perennial contradiction between farmland water conservancy construction and dike repair in Hubei Province was resolved this year because the agricultural production cooperatives were rectified, improving labor utilization.

    结合生产整顿合作社
    2月下旬，湖北省新建成的两万多个农业生产合作社，已普遍开始整顿。整社工作开始较早的襄阳和孝感专区，30％以上的社已实行了包工包产制度。这次整社工作是通过组织生产，在生产中进行的。许多地区整顿工作中由于推行了包工包产制，劳动利用率达到了空前未有的水平。湖北省历年兴修农田水利和修堤矛盾，今年由于农业生产合作社经过整顿，提高了劳动利用率，矛盾就解决了。
