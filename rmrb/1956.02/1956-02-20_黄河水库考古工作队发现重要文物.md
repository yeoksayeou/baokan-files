    The Yellow River Reservoir Archaeological Team, jointly formed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Culture, concluded its first survey work at the end of January. They have a basic understanding of the archaeological data from various historical periods within the scope of the Sanmenxia Reservoir on the Yellow River, which has prepared conditions for archaeological excavation work to cooperate with the Yellow River harnessing project and has also provided rich material cultural historical data for the study of the motherland’s history.
    According to preliminary statistics, the team discovered a total of 78 Neolithic sites, 6 Yin Dynasty sites, 44 Zhou Dynasty sites, 53 Han Dynasty sites, 40 ancient tombs, one Yuan Dynasty building, and 15 other sites including Song Dynasty sites, ancient cities, ancient kilns, ancient pagodas, and stone statues, totaling 237 sites.
    The team consisted of more than 40 people, led by Xia Nai, Deputy Director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Starting in October 1955, they were divided into 10 groups and arrived in the Sanmenxia Reservoir area of the Yellow River, conducting archaeological surveys in relevant areas of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan provinces. After the field work, the team has carried out indoor sorting work on these discoveries.
    This is the first large-scale archaeological survey since the founding of New China, and it is also the largest in the history of Chinese archaeology. The team will return to the Sanmenxia Reservoir area of the Yellow River this spring for a second archaeological survey, including a review of the first discovery.

    黄河水库考古工作队发现重要文物
    中国科学院和文化部联合组成的黄河水库考古工作队，已经在1月底结束第一次调查工作。他们基本上了解了黄河三门峡水库范围内各个历史时期的考古资料蕴藏情况，为配合治理黄河工程进行考古发掘工作准备了条件，也为研究祖国历史提供了丰富的物质文化史料。
    初步统计，工作队共发现新石器时代遗址78处，殷代遗址6处，两周遗址44处，汉代遗址53处，古冢40处，元代建筑一处，还有宋代遗址、古城、古窑、古塔、石像等15处，共计237处。
    工作队共计40多人，由中国科学院考古研究所副所长夏鼐任队长，从1955年10月，分成10个组到达黄河三门峡水库区，分别在陕西、山西和河南的有关地区进行了考古调查工作。工作队在野外工作结束后，并已经对这些发现进行了室内整理工作。
    这是新中国成立以来第一次大规模的考古调查工作，也是中国考古学史上最大的一次。工作队将在今年春季仍到黄河三门峡水库区进行第二次考古调查工作，包括对第一次发现情况的复查。
