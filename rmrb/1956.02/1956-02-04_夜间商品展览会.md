    Nighttime Merchandise Exhibition
    Recently, the Lanxi County Department Store in Zhejiang Province and the Wantang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Lanxi County brought goods to Huiqiao Township, 15 li away from the town, and held two merchandise exhibition and promotion fairs utilizing farmers' nighttime rest time. At the fairs, they introduced many commodities to the masses and also conducted on-site tests of new-style farm implements. This enabled farmers to buy commodities that they wanted to buy in the past but could not. The cooperative's stockpiled farm implements were also sold. In just two nights, they sold over 480 yuan worth of industrial products and also purchased agricultural and sideline products and waste materials such as eggs, rice, and scrap copper. This kind of exhibition not only facilitated the needs of farmers but also enabled the commercial departments to complete their sales plans.
    Using diverse methods and approaches to satisfy the people's growing demand for commodities is an important task for state-owned commercial workers. The practices of the Lanxi County Department Store and cooperative in Zhejiang Province are very good.

    夜间商品展览会
    最近，浙江省兰溪县百货公司和兰溪县万塘区供销合作社一起，带货到离镇15里的会桥乡去，利用农民夜晚休息时间，举办了两次商品展览推销会。会上，他们向群众介绍许多商品，还实地作了新式农具的试验。这样就使农民买到了过去想买而买不到的商品。合作社积存的农具，也卖出去了。只有两个晚上，他们就卖出了价值480多元的工业品，并且收购了鸡蛋、稻子和废铜等农副产品和废料。这种展览会既便利农民需要，又使商业部门完成了推销计划。
    用多种多样的方式和方法来满足人民日益增长的对商品的需求，是国营商业工作者的重要工作任务。浙江省兰溪县百货公司和合作社的做法很好。
