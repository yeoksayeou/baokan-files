Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The mail-order service department of the joint state-private ownership Yong'an Company in Shanghai now receives half again as many letters from out-of-town customers requesting purchases as it did before the joint state-private ownership. Recently, the mail-order service department has expanded its service scope to accept telephone orders from local customers and to purchase goods on behalf of factories, government organizations, and agricultural production cooperatives.
    Many other business characteristics of Yong'an Company have also been maintained after the joint state-private ownership. The cold drink counters are always crowded with customers, and even in winter, people can buy various ice creams, sodas, fresh orange juice, and other beverages here. The company's high-end cosmetics,呢帽 (ne mao - wool felt hats), and Cantonese pastries baked in its own bakery are still sold, and more than 60 new varieties have been added. The repair department attached to the watch counter enables four technicians to exchange watch repair techniques, ensuring meticulous inspection and prompt delivery. In the past, it took 3 days to replace a watch glass, but now it can be done immediately.

    公私合营永安公司保持和发扬原有经营特色
    上海市公私合营永安公司邮售服务部，现在每天收到外埠顾客委托采购货物的信件比公私合营以前增加了一半。最近，邮售服务部又扩大了服务范围，接受本地顾客电话购货和为工厂、机关、农业生产合作社代购商品。
    永安公司的其他许多经营上的特色，在公私合营以后也都保持下来。冷饮柜台经常围满了顾客，即使是冬天，人们也能在这里买到各式冰淇淋和汽水、鲜桔汁等饮料。公司经营的一些高级化妆品、呢帽和自设饼房焙制的广东点心，现在仍有出售，还增加了60多种新品种。钟表柜附设的修理部，4个技师相互交流修表技术，做到检查精细、交件迅速，过去配一块手表玻璃要3天，现在立即可取。
