	Moving Forward with Advanced Producers

	The early spring sunshine shines through the clear glass, illuminating a corner of the machine shop at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. Steam rises like fog in the workshop, and iron filings fly everywhere. Only when you get close to the lathe can you see Zhuang Minggeng, the recipient of the "Glorious Railway Worker" medal, operating the first machine tool at the east entrance of the workshop. He has already completed five years' worth of work in two years and eight months and is now working on the 1958 workload, determined to complete seven years' worth of work in four years. Many workers in the same group, workshop, and factory have diligently learned from his advanced experience and have also achieved new production results. The entire factory already has 5 workers who have completed their five-year workload ahead of schedule, and 26 workers are already working on the 1957 workload. Advanced turner Zhuang Jinkui is closely following Zhuang Minggeng, working on the 1958 workload, and he is also striving to complete six and a half years' worth of work in four years.

	Two years ago, Zhuang Minggeng's experience in improving operating methods and saving auxiliary working time was already very prominent. In 1953, he completed 25 months of work in one year and was known as "Miracle Quick Hands." At that time, many workers humbly learned from him, but Zhuang Minggeng, because his experience had not been accurately summarized, could not explain the principles behind it. At the same time, he also had the residual thought of "if you teach your apprentice, the master will starve," and deliberately mystified his experience. When people watched him operate, he would speed up and make small movements to block their view. Therefore, his relationship with the masses was very poor. Workers were not convinced and said, "He's fast, but his work is rough!" "His production is good, but his thinking is a bit backward!" Even his distant uncle, Zhuang Jinkui, was not convinced and said, "He only makes one product, what's so great about being a little faster? I dare him to come to my lathe and try."

	The factory leaders learned about this situation and systematically summarized Zhuang Minggeng's advanced experience. During the summarization of the experience, it was found that Zhuang Minggeng cherished every minute, so his auxiliary working hours were very short. At the same time, he actively learned from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and his own factory, never satisfied with the status quo. If he made 100 pieces today, he would definitely make 105 pieces tomorrow. When he made angle cock cores and copper sleeves, he often encountered tough copper. Because tough copper is difficult to work with, working hours could be increased by 15% according to the original quota, but he never asked for increased working hours. His work was not only efficient but also of good quality. This proved that some workers' reflections that he was "ideologically backward" and "his work was rough" were unfounded. At the factory's party branch secretary meeting, the factory party committee secretary affirmed and introduced Zhuang Minggeng's advanced experience. The leadership also helped Zhuang Minggeng overcome his conservative idea of not being willing to impart his experience. After some factual education, Zhuang Minggeng realized, "Without the masses, nothing can be accomplished. Only when you care about the masses will the masses care about you." From then on, he took the initiative and patiently taught workers such as Zhuang Jinkui his methods of needle-free correction and tool grinding. Zhuang Minggeng even used Zhuang Jinkui's machine to work, and as a result, the efficiency increased by 60% compared to Zhuang Jinkui. Only then was Zhuang Jinkui convinced and humbly learned, thereby increasing production efficiency by one time. The workshop party branch and the trade union seized this vivid example to carry out propaganda. The factory trade union and administration also organized technical lectures, inviting Zhuang Minggeng to share his experiences and technicians to provide guidance, enabling the 87 workers who participated in the study to systematically learn Zhuang Minggeng's experience. At the end of October 1954, 352 workers and 16 groups in the factory had completed their annual workload ahead of schedule.

	When Zhuang Minggeng went to railway factories across the country in 1955 to perform on-site operations, Harbin organized 48 advanced workers from various factories to leave production and study, which increased the efficiency of machine tools by an average of one time, and the processing efficiency of some workpieces increased by 3-5 times.

	In Zhuang Minggeng's own factory, the leadership only paid attention to holding demonstration meetings and report meetings and rarely did specific and meticulous promotion work. Therefore, the workers in the factory reflected, "Zhuang Minggeng's advanced experience blossomed in the factory but bore fruit outside the factory." After Zhuang Minggeng returned to the factory in October 1955, the factory leadership saw that the effect of running short-term training courses to promote Zhuang Minggeng's advanced experience in other places was very significant, so they ran two sessions of Zhuang Minggeng's advanced experience study class. In the study class, Zhuang Minggeng carefully prepared lessons, patiently explained, and taught everyone the experience bit by bit through actual operation. Zhao Jincheng, a master craftsman in the machine repair workshop, had worked in the same workshop as Zhuang Minggeng two years ago. In the past, he always saw Zhuang Minggeng turning angle cocks, and he always used angle cocks for performance, so he thought, "Zhuang Minggeng is only good at turning angle cocks." When the factory held the first study class, he also came to study. In the study class, he listened to Zhuang Minggeng's detailed explanation, but he was still skeptical and wanted to test Zhuang Minggeng's true skills. He said very politely, "Master Zhuang, the outer stems produced in our workshop are always bent, and the processing time is long. Do you have a solution?" Zhuang Minggeng had seen straight outer stems when he visited a factory in Jinan, so he readily agreed that he could find a way to make the outer stems straight. Zhuang Minggeng, based on the principle of woodcarving to raise the cutting edge of the knife, helped Zhao Jincheng adjust the cutting edge, raising the knife by three millimeters higher than before. As a result, the outer stems cut were not bent or skewed, the quality was very good, and the processing time for each outer stem was reduced from 12 hours to 7 hours. Only then was Zhao Jincheng convinced.

	After the study class ended, two study classes were held in the workshop, and Zhao Jincheng became a "little teacher," actively promoting Zhuang Minggeng's advanced experience. All workshops in the factory, including the machinery, locomotive, machine repair, wheel, and tool workshops, used workers who had participated in the factory study class as "little teachers" and held workshop study classes. Now, Zhuang Minggeng's advanced experience is not only actively promoted on lathes but also on planers, shapers, milling machines, drilling machines, and boring machines. The boring machine workers used Zhuang Minggeng's sharp and heat-resistant knives to change from low-speed cutting to high-speed cutting, reducing the quota for cast steel cylinders from 155 hours to 74 hours.

	In the process of imparting his experience to others without reservation, Zhuang Minggeng himself also learned a lot of advanced experience from the masses, thereby further improving his level. Zhuang Minggeng was away from the factory for half a year. When he returned to the factory and put into production, his original advanced quota had become the working hour quota for ordinary workers. Advanced worker Zhuang Jinkui could make a set of angle cocks in 28 minutes, which was 3 minutes less than the new quota. Zhuang Minggeng fully utilized the advanced experience he had learned from various places. On the first day he got on the machine, he turned 110 angle cocks, breaking the new quota in 21 minutes.

	In mid-January, the leadership transferred Zhuang Minggeng from the valve working area to the axle working area to process the accessories for the newly built 60-ton crane. Zhuang Minggeng had never produced axle accessories before, so he went to ask advanced turner Le Junde for advice. Le Junde enthusiastically told him his experience and the method of applying Fedorov's lathe tools. As a result, on the first afternoon he was transferred to the axle working area on the 17th, he completed 8 hours of work in 4 hours.

    跟先进生产者共同前进

    初春的阳光透过明净的玻璃，照射着戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂机械车间的一角。车间里蒸气似雾，铁屑飞溅，只有走近车床，才看见操纵车间东门口第一台机床的是“光荣的铁路工作者”奖章获得者庄铭耕。他已经以二年零八个月的时间完成了五年工作量，现在正在做1958年的工作量，并决心在四年内完成七年工作量。同一个小组、车间和同厂的许多工人，认真学习了他的先进经验，也创造了新的生产成绩。全厂已经有5个工人提前完成五年工作量，26个工人已经在做1957年的工作量。先进车工庄金奎紧跟着庄铭耕在做1958年的工作量，他也争取四年完成六年半的工作量。
    两年以前，庄铭耕改进操作方法、节省辅助工作时间的经验就已经很突出了。1953年他以一年时间完成了25个月的工作量，被人称为“神快手”。这时有许多工人虚心向他学习，可是庄铭耕因为经验没有经过确切的总结，讲不出道理，同时又有“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”的残余思想，故意把自己的经验神秘化，人家看他操作，他就开快车，做小动作，挡住人家的视线。因此他跟群众的关系搞得很不好，工人不服气地说：“快是快，就是做活粗糙！”“生产是好的，思想有点落后！”连他的远房叔叔庄金奎也不服气地说：“产品单一，做得快一点有什么了不起，不信叫他到我车床上来做做看”。
    工厂的领导知道了这些情况，就系统地总结了庄铭耕的先进经验。在总结经验的时候，发现庄铭耕珍惜每一分钟，因而辅助工时很短。同时他又积极学习苏联的和本厂的先进经验，从不满足现状，今天做100只，明天一定做105只。他做折角塞门芯子和铜套的时候，经常遇到韧铜，因为韧铜难做，工时可按原定额增加15％，但是他从来不要增加工时。他的工作不但效率高，质量也好。由此证明某些工人反映他“思想落后”，“做活粗糙”的说法都没有根据。在全厂党支部书记会议上，工厂党委书记肯定地介绍了庄铭耕的先进经验。领导上也帮助庄铭耕克服不肯传授经验的保守思想。再经过一些事实的教育，使庄铭耕认识到：“没有群众，什么事也干不成，只有自己关心群众，群众才会关心自己。”从此以后，他就主动地、耐心地把自己的无针校正和刀具研磨的方法，教给庄金奎等工人。庄铭耕还用庄金奎的车子干活，结果效率比庄金奎提高60％。庄金奎才服气，才虚心学习，从而把生产效率提高一倍。车间党支部和工会抓紧这一生动事例进行宣传。厂工会和行政又组织了技术讲座，请庄铭耕现身说法，技术人员作辅导，使参加学习的87个工人，系统地学会了庄铭耕的经验。1954年10月底，全厂就有352个工人和16个小组提前完成了全年工作量。
      1955年庄铭耕到全国各铁路工厂作实地操作表演的时候，哈尔滨市组织各厂48位先进工人脱离生产学习，使机床效率平均提高一倍，部分工作物加工效率提高了3—5倍。
    在庄铭耕自己的工厂里，领导上只注意开表演会、报告会，很少做具体的细致的推广工作。因此，厂里的工人反映说：“庄铭耕的先进经验在厂内开了花，却在厂外结了果”。1955年10月庄铭耕回厂后，工厂领导上看到外地举办短期训练班推广庄铭耕先进经验的效果很显著，就举办了两期庄铭耕先进经验学习班。在学习班里，庄铭耕细心地备课，耐心讲解，并且通过实际操作一点一滴地把经验教给大家。修机车间的老师傅赵金城，二年前曾经和庄铭耕在一个车间里工作过，他过去老是看到庄铭耕车折角塞门，表演时也一直拿折角塞门进行表演，因此就认为：“庄铭耕只有车折角塞门拿手。”工厂举办第一期学习班，他也来学习。在学习班上他听了庄铭耕详细的讲解，还是半信半疑，还想试一试庄铭耕的真本领。他很客气地说：“庄师傅，我们车间生产的外梗老是弯曲，加工时间又长，你有办法解决吗？”庄铭耕在济南参观工厂的时候曾经见到过不弯的外梗，就一口答应可以想法使外梗不弯。庄铭耕根据木工雕花纹把刀口抬高的原理，帮助赵金城调整了刀口，把刀子比原来抬高三个公厘，结果切削出来的外梗不弯不斜，质量很好，而且每一个外梗的加工工时从12小时降低到7小时。赵金城才服了气。
    学习班结束后，在车间举办两期学习班，赵金城就当了小先生，积极推广庄铭耕先进经验。全厂机械、机车、机修、车轮、工具等车间都以参加厂学习班的工人当小先生，举办了车间学习班。现在不但在车床上积极推行了庄铭耕的先进经验，在刨床、插床、铣床、钻床、镗床上也都推行了庄铭耕的先进经验。镗床工人们用庄铭耕锋利、耐热的刀子，改低速切削为高速切削，使铸钢汽缸的定额从155小时降低到74小时。
    庄铭耕在把自己的经验无保留地教给别人的过程中，他自己也从群众中学习到了不少先进经验，从而使自己的水平更加提高。庄铭耕离厂半年，当他回厂投入生产的时候，原来他的先进定额已经成为一般工人的工时定额，先进工人庄金奎用28分钟就能做一套折角塞门，比新定额少3分钟。庄铭耕充分运用了在各地学来的先进经验，头一天上机床，就车了110个折角塞门，以21分钟打破了新的定额。
      1月中旬，领导上把庄铭耕从阀类工区调到轴类工区去加工新造60吨吊车的配件。庄铭耕从来没有生产过轴类配件，他就去向先进车工乐俊德请教，乐俊德很热心地把自己的经验和应用费奥多洛夫车刀的方法告诉了他。结果，他在17日调到轴类工区的第一个下午，用4小时就干了8小时的工作量。
