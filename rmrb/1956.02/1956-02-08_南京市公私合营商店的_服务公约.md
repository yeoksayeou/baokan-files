Nanjing's Public-Private Partnership Stores' "Service Pledge"
Wang Pu

The employees and private owners of 38 public-private partnership stores in Nanjing have recently formulated "Service Pledges" one after another, striving to improve customer service. The service pledge of the public-private partnership Chen Yichang Sauce Garden store states: treat customers with a kind attitude, ensure food is clean, and do a good job in environmental sanitation. The service pledge of Xinyao Pharmaceutical has "three goods" and "ten not bads," guaranteeing round-the-clock supply and sales upon arrival, to better serve patients. The cotton cloth industry, which implemented public-private partnerships earlier, has also launched a competition focused on improving service. Undoubtedly, these measures are effective in promoting production, ensuring market supply, and improving customer service.

Promoting service pledges has the following three aspects of significance: First, improving service to better ensure market supply, meet people's needs, and more prominently reflect the superiority of public-private partnership enterprises; Second, guiding the socialist enthusiasm of the masses of employees during the high tide of socialist transformation towards doing a good job in production and operation, and more fully leveraging the socialist initiative of the masses; Third, the administrative leadership and trade union organizations at all levels leading and organizing the promotion of service pledges can involve private owners in the form of staff meetings and business meetings, jointly discuss and formulate service pledges, and through inspection of the implementation of service pledges, help private owners gradually abandon capitalist management thinking, establish socialist management thinking, and in conjunction with the transformation of enterprises, promote them to gradually transform themselves into genuine socialist commercial workers.

The promotion and formulation of service pledges must have a broad mass base, mobilizing as many employees as possible and involving private owners. The implementation of this work must also have a clear purpose, placing the most central current tasks on the service pledge, so as to complete and overfulfill the commodity circulation plan on time on the basis of improving service. The service pledge should be posted in a conspicuous place in the store so that customers can see it, which is convenient for mass supervision; at the same time, an inspection system must be established to prevent the competition from becoming a mere formality.

    南京市公私合营商店的“服务公约”
    王朴
    南京市38个行业公私合营商店的职工和资方从业人员，最近先后订出了“服务公约”，努力改进为顾客服务的工作。公私合营陈义昌酱园店的服务公约上写着：对顾客态度和蔼，保证食品清洁，做好环境卫生工作等条件；新药业的服务公约有“三好”“十不错”，保证日夜供应、随到随卖，更好地为病人服务。实行公私合营比较早的棉布业，还开展了以改进服务工作为主要内容的竞赛。无疑的，这些办法都是促进生产、保证市场供应和改进为顾客服务工作的有效措施。
    推广服务公约有以下三方面的意义：第一，改进服务工作，更好地保证市场供应，满足人民需要，更突出地体现公私合营企业的优越性；第二，把在社会主义改造高潮中职工群众的社会主义的热情引导到搞好生产和经营方面去，更充分地发挥群众的社会主义积极性；第三，领导和组织推广服务公约的各级行政领导和工会组织，可以通过工作人员大会和业务会议的方式，吸收资方从业人员参加，共同讨论和订立服务公约，并通过对服务公约执行情况的检查，帮助资方从业人员逐步抛弃资本主义的经营思想，树立社会主义的经营思想，并结合企业的改造，推动他们逐步地把自己改造成为一个名符其实的社会主义商业工作人员。
    推广和订立服务公约，必须有广泛的群众基础，尽可能发动全体职工和吸收资方从业人员参加。推行这一工作还必须要有明确的目的性，把当前最中心的任务订立在服务公约上，以便在改进服务工作的基础上，按时完成和超额完成商品流转计划。服务公约应当张贴在商店内醒目的地方，使顾客也能看到，以便于群众的监督；同时，还必须建立检查制度，防止竞赛流于形式。
