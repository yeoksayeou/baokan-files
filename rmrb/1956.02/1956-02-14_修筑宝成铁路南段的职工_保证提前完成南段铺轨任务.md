    Workers Building the Southern Section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    Guarantee Early Completion of Track-Laying Task
    On February 7th, the workers constructing the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway proposed to their superiors that they guarantee to lay the track of this section to Huangsha River (between Lueyang and Fengxian), where it connects with the northern section, by June 10th, ahead of schedule. The realization of this guarantee will enable the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway to be connected and opened to traffic one and a half years earlier than originally planned.
    The workers also proposed guarantees for reducing costs and expenditures and improving labor productivity in the construction of the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. (Xinhua News Agency)
