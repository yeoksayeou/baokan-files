An Example of Combining Party Rectification and Counter-Revolutionary Suppression
Zhang Rongjiu Huang Ruilin

    The Tanbai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wutang District, Yongning County, Guangxi Province, was established in the spring of 1954. It originally had 11 households. In its first year, it increased grain production by more than 20,000 jin and received the honorary title of "Excellent Agricultural Cooperative." By the spring of 1955, the cooperative had expanded to 76 households.

    However, problems arose at this time. Production in the cooperative gradually became chaotic. Some cooperative members were not enthusiastic about working, and 30 to 50 people often wandered around the market. Cooperative cadres complained to each other and were not united. The cooperative chairman said that poor peasants were "chicken heads and duck feet" and had no meat. Poor peasant cadres could not run the household or make decisions. Production management systems were lax, and production plans were not fulfilled. 18 out of 75 oxen died. The early rice crop was originally planned to yield 160,000 jin, but it did not even reach 110,000 jin. Cooperative members complained about the cooperative cadres, and seven or eight households even threatened to withdraw from the cooperative. Some cooperative cadres wanted to withdraw and establish a new cooperative.

    To solve this problem, the Party branch, work team, cooperative cadres, and cooperative members held numerous meetings and proposed many solutions, such as strengthening political and ideological education, guiding cooperative members to recognize the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, strengthening unity among cooperative members, and implementing contract production, etc. However, the problem was not solved. This worried the branch, cooperative management cadres, and the district committee. Some cadres were even unwilling to work in this cooperative, and the branch lost confidence in running the cooperative well.

    In early September, Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was transmitted. The district committee, branch, and cooperative management cadres were inspired by this report and began to rectify the cooperative from a political perspective and from the perspective of implementing the Party's class policy.

    After in-depth investigation, it was discovered that the cooperative's organization was seriously impure. The cooperative chairman, Lu Renguang, was originally a hidden counter-revolutionary element. Before liberation, he was trained in the "Reformatory" established by Li Zongren's wife. After returning home, he trafficked in firearms and opened a small arms factory in the village. After liberation, he also shielded landlords and colluded with professional secret agents. During the land reform, he pretended to be active and seized positions such as township production minister and township government committee member. He also used his power to forge documents and steal the titles of "Labor Model" of the county and province and the position of chairman of the Tanbai Cooperative. Then, he infiltrated the Party and fraudulently obtained the positions of deputy secretary and organization committee member of the branch. He consistently resisted the Party's resolutions overtly or covertly and undermined the Party's various measures. He attacked active poor peasants, repeatedly insulted Fang Huancheng, a poor peasant backbone, and falsely accused Lu Qiuhua (a Party member), a poor peasant cooperative committee member, of being a thief. On the other hand, he promoted Lu Qiusou, a hidden counter-revolutionary element, to be the administrative team leader and the cooperative's acting production team leader and scorekeeper. Under his manipulation, four households of landlords, four households of rich peasants, and 49 people including counter-revolutionary elements, puppet police officers, puppet military officers, and habitual bandits were mixed into the cooperative. Some of them even seized important positions and controlled the leadership. Among the 21 cadres above the team leader level in the cooperative, there were 7 bad elements.

    After understanding the above situation, the work team systematically and specifically publicized the Party's class policy, organized cooperative members to discuss "why rely on poor peasants," "who actively supports the agricultural cooperation movement," and "who opposes and sabotages the agricultural cooperation movement." After discussion, cadres and cooperative members initially recognized the importance of implementing the class policy, but some were still concerned about not being thorough and feared retaliation from bad elements. The work team also mobilized Party groups and poor peasant backbones to study the reasons why the cooperative was not well-run and could not complete production plans; and made it clear that the Party and the government would definitely support the poor peasants in running the cooperative well and resolutely suppress the bad elements who sabotage the cooperative. The awareness of cooperative cadres and cooperative members was further enhanced, and they first exposed the fact that Lu Dayuan, a reactionary landlord who had infiltrated the cooperative, had sabotaged the cooperative. Lu Dayuan controlled the production team, scolded and attacked cooperative members and cooperative cadres, and provoked disunity between his team and the fourth production team. When rectifying the unified purchase and marketing work in April 1955, he incited cooperative members to go to the mountains to dig sweet potatoes instead of working in the cooperative; during the busy summer harvest, cooperative members went to work on the farm, and he was the one who took them there; in August, when the cooperative harvested jute, he incited cooperative members to weed the fields, disrupting the cooperative's plan, and even instigated wealthy farmer Fang Dejia to find poisonous insects to kill the oxen. At the same time, everyone exposed a hidden professional secret agent, Lu Qiusou. The three oxen that the cooperative entrusted to Lu Qiusou for management were all killed by him one after another; he also incited cooperative members not to participate in the cooperative's production. After these criminal facts of the enemy were exposed, poor peasant backbones and cooperative members demanded that these hidden counter-revolutionary elements be severely punished.

    On this basis, many cooperative members conducted self-criticism, criticized the harmfulness of spontaneous capitalist tendencies, and recognized that this was a big loophole for the enemy to exploit to carry out sabotage. Then, they exposed the criminal activities of the landlord, rich peasants, and other bad elements who had infiltrated the cooperative, and further traced the root to "how did the enemy infiltrate," "why did Lu Renguang insist on absorbing them," and "why did Lu Renguang consistently attack poor peasants and resist the Party's various measures"... This launched a struggle against Lu Renguang, the backbone of the hidden counter-revolutionary elements. Finally, the branch meeting resolved to expel Lu Renguang from the Party and suggested that the administrative side dismiss him from his administrative positions.

    After this series of struggles, the public security organs arrested counter-revolutionary elements Lu Dayuan, Lu Qiusou, and Lu Renguang according to law. The cooperative also expelled four households of landlords, two households of rich peasants, and two households of family members of counter-revolutionary elements who insisted on reactionary positions from the cooperative. The remaining rich peasant, Qin Aizhen, who had been wrongly classified but performed well, was only dismissed from his positions as cooperative committee member and deputy team leader, and remained in the cooperative.

    Then, the leadership work of the cooperative in the previous stage was summarized, and after repeated discussions, a new cooperative committee with poor peasants as the leading backbone was elected at the general meeting of all cooperative members. Poor peasant Fang Huancheng was elected chairman of the cooperative. He said that in the future, he would definitely resolutely implement the Party's instructions and resolutions, consult with the masses more, and run the cooperative well. The cooperative members also unanimously supported him, saying: This time it is a democratic election, and the cooperative run by poor peasants will definitely have a way to run it well.

    The Tanbai Cooperative closely combined rectification with production throughout the rectification process. The leadership proposed: "Do a good job in production and rectify the cooperative well." In the process of rectifying the cooperative, the investigation of accidents that sabotaged production cracked down on hidden enemies and enhanced the awareness and production enthusiasm of cooperative members; attention was also paid to leading production, and production was also done well. Cooperative members who were lazy in the past became diligent, and the attendance rate reached more than 90%. During the rectification of the cooperative, 199 mu of rice were fertilized in time, and 40 mu of winter sweet potatoes and 100 mu of wheat were planted; and a comprehensive production plan was carried out.

    整社和肃反相结合的一个例子
    张荣久　黄瑞麟
    广西省邕宁县五塘区坛白农业生产合作社是在1954年春天建立起来的，原有11户，建社第一年就增产了2万多斤粮食，获得了“优秀农业社”的光荣称号。到1955年春天，全社扩大到76户。
    但是，就在这时候，问题发生了。社里生产逐渐混乱，有的社员出工不积极，经常有三、五十人到墟上去东游西荡；社干部互相埋怨，闹不团结。社长说贫农是“鸡头鸭脚”没有肉。贫农成份的社干部当不上家，作不了主。生产管理制度松懈，生产完不成计划；75头耕牛死了18头，早糙原计划收16万斤，却连11万斤也收不到。社员埋怨社干部，甚至有七、八户闹着要退社。有一部分社干部想退出去另建一个新社。
    为了解决这个问题，党支部、工作组、社干部、社员不知开了多少次会，也提出了不少办法，如加强政治思想教育，引导社员认识农业合作社的优越性，加强社员团结、搞好包工包产等等；但是，问题并没有解决。这可使支部、办社干部、区委烦恼起来了。有的干部甚至不愿意到这个社去工作，支部对办好这个社也失掉了信心。
    9月初，毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告传达下来了，区委、支部和办社干部从这个报告里得到了启发，开始从政治方面、从贯彻执行党的阶级政策方面去整顿这个社。
    经过深入调查，发现了这个社的组织严重不纯。社长陆任光原来是一个暗藏的反革命分子。解放前他在李匪宗仁老婆设立的“教养院”受过训练，回家以后，贩卖枪枝，在村里开小兵工厂。解放后他还包庇地主，和职业特务勾勾搭搭。土地改革的时候他假装积极，窃取了乡生产部长、乡政府委员等职位。他又利用职权，伪造文件，窃取了县、省的“劳动模范”称号和坛白社社长职务；接着就钻入党内，骗取了支部副书记、组织委员的位置。他一贯或明或暗地抵抗党的决议，破坏党的各项措施。他打击积极贫农，几次辱骂贫农骨干方焕承，诬说贫农社委陆秋华（党员）是小偷。另一方面他提拔暗藏的反革命分子陆秋收当行政组长和社的代理生产队长、记分员。在他的操纵把持下，漏划地主四户、富农四户及反革命分子、伪巡官、伪军官、惯匪等49人混入社内，有一部分还窃据了重要职位，把持领导大权。在全社21个队长以上的干部中，就有坏分子7人。
    了解了上述情况后，工作组就系统地具体地宣传党的阶级政策，组织社员讨论“为什么依靠贫农”、“什么人对合作化运动积极拥护”、“什么人反对和破坏合作化运动”。经过讨论，干部和社员都初步认识了贯彻执行阶级政策的重要，但有些仍顾虑搞不彻底，怕坏分子报复。工作组又发动党小组和贫农骨干研究合作社办不好、不能完成生产计划的原因；并且表明党和政府一定支持贫农把合作社办好、坚决镇压破坏合作社的坏分子。社干部、社员的觉悟进一步提高了，他们首先揭发了钻进社内的反动地主陆达远破坏合作社的事实。陆达远把持生产队，谩骂和打击社员、社干部，挑拨本队和第四生产队闹不团结。1955年4月整顿统购统销工作的时候，他煽动社员跑到山上去挖山薯，不到社里做工；夏收大忙的时候，社员跑到农场做工，也是他拉去的；8月份社里收黄麻，他又煽动社员去耘田，打乱社的计划，甚至挑唆富裕农民方德佳找毒虫来害死耕牛。与此同时，大家又揭发出一名潜伏的职业特务陆秋收。社里给陆秋收管理的三头耕牛，都先后被他害死了；他还煽惑社员不参加社的生产。敌人的这些罪恶事实揭发出来以后，贫农骨干和社员都纷纷要求严办这些暗藏的反革命分子。
    在这基础上，很多社员都进行了自我批评，批判了资本主义自发趋势的危害性，认识了这是给敌人利用来进行破坏的一个大空子。接着他们又揭发了打入社里来的漏划地主、富农和其他坏分子的罪恶活动，进一步追根到“敌人是怎样钻进来的”、“陆任光为什么坚持吸收他们”、“陆任光为什么一贯打击贫农、对抗党的各项措施”……这样就展开了对暗藏的反革命分子骨干陆任光的斗争。最后，支部大会决议，开除陆任光的党籍，并且建议行政方面，撤销他的行政职务。
    经过这一系列的斗争，公安机关先后依法逮捕了反革命分子陆达远、陆秋收、陆任光。社内又通过把漏划地主四户、富农二户及坚持反动立场的反革命分子家属二户开除出社；其余漏划富农覃爱珍因为表现还好，只撤销他的社委、副队长等职务，仍然留在社内。
    然后，总结了上一阶段合作社的领导工作，并且经过反复讨论，在全体社员大会上选出以贫农为领导骨干的新的社委会。贫农方焕承当选社长。他表示今后一定坚决执行党的指示、决议，多同群众商量，把社办好。社员也一致拥护，说：这回才是民主选举，贫农当家的社，一定有办法办好。
    坛白社在整顿过程中一直密切结合了生产。领导上提出：“搞好生产整好社”，在整社过程中，从追查破坏生产的事故，打击了暗藏的敌人，提高了社员的觉悟和生产积极性；又注意了领导生产，把生产也搞好了。过去懒出工的社员变勤了，出勤率达到90％以上。整社中抓紧施了199亩禾胎肥，种上了冬红薯40亩、小麦100亩；并且进行了生产的全面规划。
