Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 6th - TASS reports: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) has issued a statement regarding the decision by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior to prohibit the WFTU from conducting activities on Austrian territory.

The statement said: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions most strongly protests this decision and emphasizes that a minister of the Austrian government seeks to seize the right to control the World Federation of Trade Unions congress and to control the procedures for establishing the leading bodies of this federation – the Executive Committee and the Council. This is an unprecedented example of a government interfering in the internal affairs of a labor and trade union organization, namely the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The statement further emphasized that the reason given by the Austrian Minister of the Interior for making this decision is that the World Federation of Trade Unions defends the interests of the people in the colonial territories within the United Nations. The statement pointed out that the World Federation of Trade Unions has consistently and openly defended the right of peoples to self-determination. It has consistently condemned the violent actions of colonialists. It has done so in the United Nations and has fully complied with the principles and charter of the United Nations.

The statement said that the World Federation of Trade Unions cannot allow its legitimate and normal activities within the United Nations to be treated as illegal. In order to ensure the further activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Secretariat will convene an Executive Committee meeting in the near future to discuss the situation. The Secretariat requests trade union organizations to temporarily send all mail to the President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, Vittorio, at the address Corso d'Italia 25, Rome.

The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions announced that the WFTU will never cease its struggle to protect the working people of all countries, and it will continue to maintain fraternal relations with industrial workers of all tendencies in Austria.

The statement concluded by saying that no force can paralyze the activities of this organization, which has 85 million members and is a medium for solidarity between workers in capitalist, socialist, and colonial countries. The WFTU continues to fight for peace, freedom, and a better life for the working people of the world.

    世界工联抗议奥地利政府的决定
    新华社据塔斯社维也纳6日讯　世界工会联合会书记处就奥地利内政部禁止世界工会联合会在奥地利领土上进行活动的决定发表了一项声明。
    声明说：世界工会联合会书记处最强力地抗议这一决定，并且强调指出，奥地利政府的一名部长想要夺取权利以控制世界工会联合会代表大会和控制建立这个联合会的领导机构——执行委员会和理事会——的程序。这是一国的政府空前地干涉一个劳工和工会组织、即世界工会联合会的内部事务的事例。
    声明进一步强调指出，奥地利内政部长对作出这一决定所提出的理由是：世界工会联合会是维护联合国内各殖民地人民的利益的。声明指出，世界工会联合会一贯公开维护人民享有自决的权利。它一贯地谴责殖民主义者的暴力行动。它在联合国里也是这样做的，并且充分地遵守了联合国的原则和宪章。
    声明说，世界工会联合会不能允许它在联合国的合法的正常活动被当作是非法的。为了保证世界工会联合会的进一步的活动，书记处将在短期内召开执行委员会会议来讨论这种情况。书记处要求工会组织暂时把所有邮件寄给世界工会联合会主席、意大利总工会总书记维多里奥，地址是罗马科索、迪塔利亚街25号。
    世界工会联合会书记处宣布，世界工联将一刻也不停止它保护一切国家劳动人民的斗争，它将继续和奥地利的具有各种倾向的产业职工保持兄弟般的关系。
    声明最后说，没有任何力量能够瘫痪拥有8，500万会员并且是资本主义、社会主义和殖民地国家工人之间的团结的媒介的这个组织的活动。世界工联继续为争取和平、自由和全世界劳动人民更好的生活而斗争。
