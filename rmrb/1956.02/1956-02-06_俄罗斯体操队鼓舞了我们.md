The friendship competition and performance between the Gymnastics Team of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Chinese Gymnastics Team in Beijing gave us great inspiration and encouragement. Their technical level is very comprehensive. The perfection and accuracy of their movements is an important link in winning the competition. For example, in the floor exercise, there is generally musical accompaniment in Soviet competitions, which not only makes people feel the beauty of the movements, but also helps athletes to more accurately control the speed of the movements. In this friendship competition in Beijing, in order to follow the competition rules of the Olympic Games, there was no music, but their movements were still clear, coordinated, accurate and rhythmic.

The athletes of the Russian Gymnastics Team, especially the female athletes, used very skilled techniques to complete many complex and difficult movements, such as the low bar hand-foot forward circling turn 180 degrees on the uneven bars, grabbing the high bar to low bar belly circling, and backward kick-up on the balance beam. These are all relatively advanced movements for women. They are also very serious about controlling some small movements and postures. In particular, their arms and legs never bend arbitrarily, whether they are still or waving in the air when jumping. In many static movements, they also often maintain a beautiful posture of chest out, abdomen in, eyes looking forward, and legs straight, giving people a feeling of relaxed beauty.

In many international competitions, Soviet gymnasts have been invincible. Our country's gymnastics is still young. The task before us is: to humbly and tirelessly learn from the Soviet Union, improve our sports technical level, win glory for the motherland, and make the people's sports cause more effectively serve the motherland's national defense and economic construction.

    俄罗斯体操队鼓舞了我们
    1955年全国体操测验女子甲组全能冠军　陈孝彰
    俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国体操队在北京同中国体操队的友谊比赛和表演，给了我们极大的启发和鼓舞。他们每个人的技术水平都是非常全面的。他们动作的完美和准确性，是在比赛中取得胜利的重要一环。例如自由体操一项，在苏联的比赛中一般都有音乐伴奏，这样不但能使人们感觉到动作的优美，同时也能帮助运动员更确切地去控制动作的速度。这次在北京的友谊比赛，为了按照奥林匹克运动会的比赛规则进行，没有音乐，可是他们的动作仍然很清楚协调、准确而富有韵律。
    俄罗斯体操队运动员，特别是女运动员，她们都用极熟练的技术完成了许多复杂而困难的动作，如高低杠的低杠手足正回环转体180度、抓高杠到低杠腹回环，反身蹬足上等，都是女子动作中较高级的动作。她们对一些细小的动作和姿式的控制，也都非常认真。特别表现在她们的双臂和腿不管在停止或跃起在空中挥动时，决不随意弯曲。在许多静止的动作中，她们也都经常保持着挺胸、收腹、眼向前平视、双腿笔直的优美姿态，给人们一种轻松自如的美的感觉。
    在多次国际比赛中，苏联的体操运动员们都是所向无敌的。我国的体操运动还年青，摆在我们面前的任务是：虚心地、不倦地向苏联学习，提高我们的运动技术水平，为祖国争取荣誉、使人民的体育事业能更有效地为祖国的国防和经济建设服务。
