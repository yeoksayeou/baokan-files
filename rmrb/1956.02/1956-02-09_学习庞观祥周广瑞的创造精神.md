Column: Learning from Advanced Producers

    The news that Pang Guanxiang, a worker, and Zhou Guangrui, a technician, at the Fushun Tiger Tail Mine, boldly broke with convention and created new coal mining methods, increasing efficiency by more than double, has caused a great response among the staff and workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Medium-Sized Rolling Mill.

    On January 28, after the newspaper carrying Pang Guanxiang's model deeds was delivered to the Medium-Sized Mill, the trade union immediately wrote this moving news on the blackboard newspaper to publicize it to the workers. Subsequently, the factory director and the party branch secretary gave mobilization reports to the workers at the pre-shift meetings, calling on everyone to learn this valuable spirit, actively put forward rationalization proposals, and raise production to a new height. After listening to the mobilization report, the workers were in high spirits and immediately launched a wave of enthusiasm for learning from the creative spirit of Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui. Sun Shaoren, the shift foreman of the fishplate workshop who recently proposed changing the heating time of fishplates from 3 minutes to 2.5 minutes, thereby increasing production by 17%, this time proposed changing the heating time to 2 minutes and automating the roller table on the south side of the punching machine. Worker Yu Zuochang proposed a new method of changing rolls, which, according to preliminary estimates, could increase the country's steel production by 20,000 tons per year if successful. Production assistant Zhang Tailai and others are also studying and summarizing experiences such as quick roll changing. Workers have put forward preliminary suggestions for improving labor organization in production, bringing a new atmosphere to production, and creating three new records in recent days, the highest of which exceeded the daily production plan by 19%.

    学习庞观祥周广瑞的创造精神
    抚顺老虎台矿工人庞观祥和技术员周广瑞大胆打破常规、创造新的采煤方法提高效率一倍以上的消息，在鞍钢中型轧钢厂职工中引起了很大反响。
    1月28日，刊登庞观祥模范事迹的报纸送到中型厂以后，工会立即把这个动人的消息写在黑板报上，向工人进行宣传。接着，厂长和党总支书记又在班前会上向工人作了动员报告，号召大家学习这种可贵精神，积极提出合理化建议，把生产提高到一个新的高度。工人们听过动员报告后，情绪高涨，会后立即掀起了学习庞观祥和周广瑞的创造精神的热潮。不久前提出把鱼尾板加热时间从3分钟改为2.5分钟，因而提高生产17％的鱼尾板工段值班工长孙绍仁，这次又提出要把加热时间改为两分钟，把冲孔机南面辊道改为自动化。工人于作昌提出新的换辊方法，据初步估计，成功后每年可以给国家增产2万吨钢材。生产助理张泰来等人也正在研究总结快速换辊等经验。工人在生产中提出了初步改善劳动组织的建议，使生产出现了新气象，连日创造3次新纪录，其中最高的超过日产量计划19％。
