    The Driving Force of Communist Construction
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    In the few years since the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, people who care about Soviet affairs have felt the tremendous increase in the enthusiasm of the Soviet masses, and have observed many new phenomena resulting from the closer ties between the Party and the masses. Mass enthusiasm is the fundamental driving force of communist construction. It guaranteed the early completion of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, and it will guarantee the smooth implementation of the even greater Sixth Five-Year Plan. The high tide of mass enthusiasm can be seen everywhere: the socialist emulation carried out by industrial workers in entire cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev, the heroic deeds of tens of thousands of young land reclaimers who have turned wasteland into fertile fields under the call of the Party, and the wisdom of millions of people concentrated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan...

    The wise leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the decisive reason for the upsurge of mass enthusiasm in the Soviet Union. In the past few years, the CPSU Central Committee has decided on many important policies, enabling communist construction not only to progress but also to progress rapidly. The programs on further developing agriculture, reclaiming wasteland, striving for great development of heavy industry, and striving for technological progress decided by the recent plenary sessions of the CPSU Central Committee are of historical significance, and they continue to have a huge and far-reaching impact on the life of the Party and the people.

    Under the leadership of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers, a series of conferences of Party, Soviet, and national economic departments’ staff and advanced laborers have been held in the past two years, such as the All-Union Industrial, Agricultural, Construction, and Railway staff conferences, which listened to and exchanged extensive opinions from the masses across the country.

    In the past few years, the Soviet Party and government have taken many important measures to bring economic leadership closer to production and improve the work of government agencies. In order to avoid excessive centralization that makes specific leadership difficult, and to increase local initiative, many all-Union ministries have been reorganized into ministries of the allied republics, and many enterprises managed by the all-Union level have been transferred to the management of the allied republics. Management agencies have been streamlined, and many cadres have gone from the agencies to factories and rural areas to participate in production.

    The leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regularly inspect local areas, visit factories and collective farms, and participate in meetings of lower-level organizations. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union requires staff of Party organizations at all levels to go deep among the masses to understand specific situations, solve practical problems on the spot, and conduct specific organizational and political work among the people.

    All of this cannot but strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses.

    In strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, in enhancing the enthusiasm of the masses, and in ensuring the rapid development of communist construction, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has made good use of a powerful weapon in the past few years - criticism and self-criticism, making the valuable experience of criticism and self-criticism even richer.

    As everyone knows, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has sharply and even severely criticized shortcomings in agriculture, construction, and industry in recent years. Now it is clear that it was this timely and serious criticism that helped the further comprehensive development of agriculture and helped construction rapidly move towards industrialization. Equally clear, the reason why the Sixth Five-Year Plan can be carried out with such widespread adoption of new technologies is precisely because the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee in July last year focused on criticizing the complacency of some staff members and the phenomenon of failing to adopt new technologies (including foreign new technologies).

    If someone patiently reads through the editorials, articles, and communications in Soviet newspapers about domestic Soviet issues in recent years, day by day, he will find a characteristic: that is, no editorial fails to make criticisms and suggestions targeting current specific shortcomings, and articles and communications that completely do not criticize shortcomings are also rare. These daily criticisms, whether deep or shallow, touch on the issues that the masses care about, so people feel the close relationship between the newspapers and the organizations they represent and themselves.

    If someone notices the grassroots Party organization congresses, district, city, state, and border Party representative conferences, and the Party congresses of the various allied republics held in the months before the 20th Congress of the CPSU, then he will also find that no meeting fails to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and that the reports at the meetings are first filled with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism as the advocacy of the entire meeting process.

    There is progress only with criticism. People can see that it is now common in the Soviet Union for Party leaders and Party newspapers to publicly name and criticize a certain unit or a certain person in charge, ordering them to improve their work or style. Comrade Khrushchev said something very interesting at the recent meeting of outstanding young people reclaiming wasteland. He said: "Our cadres are very good. Of course, one cannot be complacent. You may now say, you now say that people are good cadres, but later you criticize them again. That's right, both of these aspects are correct, because the cadres are indeed good cadres. However, even good cadres should be criticized in order to make them even better. There is no contradiction in these two aspects."

    Like criticizing shortcomings, supporting the advanced is considered the most important opportunity to unleash the enthusiasm of the masses in the Soviet Union. Representatives of Party organizations at all levels of the CPSU have recently criticized the practice of relying on average figures on statistical tables to judge situations and conduct leadership. This is understandable. Because tables are not the situation itself, and advanced things cannot be seen or backward things discovered on average figures. In recent years, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has doubled its attention to the promotion of advanced experience. The All-Union Agricultural Exhibition concentrates and exchanges advanced new experiences in agriculture across the country every year, becoming the most beloved "university" for agricultural laborers. Local areas also regularly hold agricultural exhibitions to promote advanced experience. Not only in cities but also in rural areas, visits and studies are organized to advanced units and advanced people. Publishing houses and periodicals widely disseminate the experience of advanced laborers. In the speeches of Party leaders and in the newspapers, enterprises or regions with the same conditions but very different results are often cited, using vivid contrasts to educate people to learn from the advanced.

    Relying on the enthusiasm of the masses and following the mass line - this is most fully manifested in the formulation process of the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

    The Soviet Union's formulation of the Sixth Five-Year Plan this time went through a meticulous process of discussion from the bottom up, planning, compiling into a general draft, then taking the draft to the entire Party and the entire people for discussion and supplementation, and finally submitting it to the 20th Congress of the CPSU for discussion and decision.

    Last spring, a new agricultural planning method began to be implemented in Soviet rural areas. According to this method, only the procurement, advance purchase, and purchase of agricultural products and livestock products, and the payment in kind to tractor stations, are stipulated by the central authorities; collective farms, with the participation of tractor stations, can plan their own planting area of ​​crops, the number of livestock, and the output of livestock products based on these tasks and the needs of collective farms and farmers for agricultural products. The new method has given collective farmers, agricultural technicians, tractor stations and state farm staff a great opportunity to exert their initiative. The achievements of Soviet agricultural work in 1955 have already demonstrated the benefits of the new planning method. The composition of the total sown area of ​​the Soviet Union has been improved, and the sown area of ​​the high-yield crop corn has been expanded four times. The total harvest of the Soviet Union was higher, and the grain handed over to the state at procurement and purchase prices was 147 million poods more than in 1954. Hundreds of thousands of collective farms have made long-term plans for five or six years, striving to complete these plans ahead of schedule.

    Last autumn, all employees of Soviet industrial enterprises actively participated in the discussion and formulation of the five-year plans of various enterprises with the attitude of masters. Workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of various enterprises put forward many valuable suggestions during the discussion. Employees of the Kharkov Tractor Factory put forward more than 1,500 suggestions on improving labor productivity and increasing products. Employees of the Leningrad Stalin Metal Factory suggested transferring the production of certain types of products to other factories, allowing this factory to focus on the production of turbines, so that by 1960, the output of turbines could be increased by one and a half times, labor productivity could be doubled, and the cost of turbines could be reduced by about 45%.

    The Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan draft was produced on the solid foundation of the high political enthusiasm and rich production experience of the broad masses. When formulating the draft plan, the CPSU Central Committee considered the suggestions of many industrial enterprises and collective farm units. A large number of people, including workers, collective farm members, experts, and scientists, participated in the preparation and formulation of these suggestions. They helped the Party Central Committee to more fully stipulate the tasks of developing various departments of the national economy during the Sixth Five-Year Plan and to identify the huge potential in various departments.

    After the Sixth Five-Year Plan draft was published, when the Soviet people discussed it across the country, they continued to explore the potential possibilities in the national economy, launched a competition to strive to complete the 1956 plan ahead of schedule, and put forward various specific suggestions that are beneficial to the development of Soviet productivity like a tide. At Party meetings, at mass meetings, and in Pravda and local Party newspapers, people put forward many supplementary opinions. Krasin, a Doctor of Physics and Mathematics in Moscow, proposed to set up several experimental nuclear reactors for the Academies of Sciences of the Republics and the branches of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, as well as universities, to expand scientific organs that study the peaceful use of atomic energy. Kotov, an engineer in Magnitogorsk, proposed to build more large iron mines in order to supply more iron ore to the steel enterprises in the Urals, Siberia, and Kazakhstan. Yefremov, Secretary of the CPSU Kuibyshev State Committee, proposed to pay special attention to further developing the oil and gas industry in the Volga River basin, and to increase the oil resources explored in the Kuibyshev Oblast by four or five times and the oil production by two and a half to three times in five years. Sinizhen, director of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, proposed to build a separate factory specializing in the production of engines, so that the output of this tractor factory would be four times that of 1955. Karashev, a lathe worker at the Kirov Factory in Leningrad, proposed to instruct the economic, Party, Soviet, and trade union organizations to ensure the improvement of the work of production innovators and to pay attention to the most rapid adoption of valuable inventions and rationalization proposals. Smirnov, director of the Kokchetav State Farm Administration, proposed that it is more beneficial to build ordinary railways than narrow-gauge railways in the newly reclaimed areas. Nacharov, editor-in-chief of the "Gardens and Orchards" publication, proposed to recommend to all collective farms and state farms (except for the far north) to formulate long-term plans for the development of orchards (vineyards), and the Soviet State Planning Committee should formulate long-term plans for the national development of orchards and vineyards. Panfilova, principal of Moscow No. 246 Middle School, proposed to create the material conditions necessary for the realization of comprehensive technical education tasks, and to let industrial enterprises participate in this work not voluntarily but obligatorily. ...The enthusiasm of the people is rising. Undoubtedly, it will continue to rise with the implementation of the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

    The Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan is the crystallization of the comprehensive wisdom of the leadership and the masses, the Party and the people.

    All this shows that in recent years, the Soviet people have been more closely united around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee, and are moving towards a communist society with even greater enthusiasm.

    共产主义建设的动力
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    从苏共十九次代表大会以来的这几年中，关心苏联事情的人们都会感觉到苏联群众积极性的巨大增长，都会观察到由于党和群众联系的更加密切而产生的许多新气象。群众积极性，这是共产主义建设的基本动力。它保证了苏联发展国民经济的第五个五年计划的提早完成，它将保证更伟大的第六个五年计划的顺利执行。群众积极性的高涨是到处可以见到的：莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅等等整个城市的工业劳动者进行的社会主义竞赛，成千成万的青年垦荒者在党的号召下把荒地变为良田的壮举，在第六个五年计划中集中的千百万人们的智慧……。
    苏联共产党的英明领导，——这是苏联群众积极性高涨的决定性原因。这几年来苏共中央委员会决定了许多重要的方针，使共产主义建设不仅进展着而且迅速地进展着。最近几次苏共中央全会所决定的关于进一步发展农业，关于开垦荒地，关于争取重工业的大发展，关于争取技术进步的纲领，都是有历史意义的，它们在党和人民的生活中继续起着巨大和深远的影响。
    在苏共中央和苏联部长会议的领导之下，最近两年举行了一系列党、苏维埃和国民经济重要部门的工作人员和先进劳动者的会议，如像全苏工业、农业、建筑、铁路等等工作人员会议，听取了和交换了来自全国群众的广泛的意见。
    苏联党和政府这几年采取了许多重要措施，使经济领导接近生产，改进政府机关的工作。为了避免过度集中以致难于具体领导，为了提高地方的积极性，许多全苏的部改组为加盟共和国的部，许多全苏管理的企业移交了加盟共和国管理。精简了管理机关，许多干部从机关下到了工厂和农村参加生产。
    苏联共产党领导人员经常视察地方，访问工厂和农庄，参加下层组织的会议。苏联共产党要求各级党组织的工作人员多下到群众中去了解具体情况，就地解决实际问题，对人进行具体的组织工作和政治工作。
    所有这些都不能不加强党和群众的联系。
    在加强党和群众的联系上，在提高群众的积极性上，在保证共产主义建设的迅速发展上，苏联共产党这几年很好地运用了有力的武器——批评和自我批评，使批评和自我批评的宝贵经验更加丰富起来。
    大家知道，苏联共产党这几年来尖锐地甚至严厉地不断批评了在农业、在建筑、在工业各方面的缺点。现在很明显了，正是这种及时的认真的批评，帮助了农业的进一步全面发展，帮助了建筑迅速走向工业化。同样明显的，第六个五年计划所以能够带着那么广泛地采用新技术的优点，正是因为去年7月苏共中央全会着重地批评了某些工作人员当中的自满情绪以及采用新技术（包括外国的新技术）不力的现象。
    如果有人耐心地逐日翻阅这几年来苏联报纸关于苏联国内问题的社论、专文、通讯，那么他会发现一个特点，这就是没有一篇社论不针对当前的具体缺点提出批评和意见，完全不批评缺点的专文和通讯也很少见。这些日常的批评或深或浅地接触着群众关心的问题，所以使人们感觉到报纸及其代表的组织和自己之间的关系的密切。
    如果有人注意到在苏共二十次代表大会以前几个月间所举行的基层党组织大会，区、市、州、边疆党代表会议，各加盟共和国的党代表大会，那么他同样会发现没有一个会议不开展批评和自我批评，而且在会议上的报告中首先充满着批评和自我批评的精神作为整个会议过程的倡导。
    有批评才有进步。人们可以看到，党领导人和党报当众指名批评某某单位或某某负责人，责成他们改进工作或作风，在苏联现在是常事了。赫鲁晓夫同志最近在开垦荒地的优秀青年会议上说了一段很有意思的话。他说：“我们的干部是很好的。当然，不能自满。你们现在也许会说，您现在说人家是好干部，以后可又批评人家。不错，这两方面都是对的，因为，干部的确是好的干部。但是，即使是对好的干部也应该批评，以便使他们更好。这两方面是没有任何矛盾的。”
    和批评缺点一样，支持先进，在苏联被认为发挥群众积极性的最重要契机。苏共各级党组织的代表最近批评了那种依靠统计表格上的平均数字来判断情况和进行领导的作法。这是可以理解的。因为表格不是情况本身，在平均数字上看不到先进的东西也发现不了落后的东西。这几年来，苏联共产党加倍注意先进经验的推广问题。全苏农业展览会每年集中和交流着全国农业方面先进的新经验，成为农业劳动者最喜爱的“大学”。各地方也经常举行推广先进经验的农业展览会。不但在城市而且在农村组织着向先进单位和先进人们的参观和学习。出版社和报刊广泛地传播着先进劳动者的经验。在党的负责人的讲演中，在报纸上，经常举出条件相同而成绩相差很远的企业或地区，用鲜明的对比，教育人们向先进者看齐。
    依靠群众积极性，走群众路线，——这最充分地表现在苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划的制定过程中。
    苏联这次制定第六个五年计划，是经过由下而上地讨论，规划，汇集成总的草案，又把草案拿到全党全民当中去讨论，补充，最后提到苏共二十次代表大会上讨论和决定这样周密过程的。
    去年春天，在苏联农村中开始实行了新的农业计划办法。按照这个办法，只有农产品和畜产品的采购、预购和收购，对拖拉机站的实物支付，是由中央机关规定的；集体农庄在拖拉机站的参加下，根据这些任务并且根据集体农庄和庄员对农产品的需要，可以自己规划农作物的播种面积、牲畜头数和畜产品产量。新办法给了集体农民、农业技术人员、拖拉机站和国营农场工作人员大大发挥自己积极性的机会。1955年苏联农业工作的成就已经证明新的计划办法的好处。全苏播种面积的构成改善了，高产量作物玉米的播种面积扩大了四倍。全苏收成较高，按采购和收购价格交给国家的粮食比1954年多14，700万普特。成千累百集体农庄作出了五、六年的远景计划，争取提前完成这些计划。
    去年秋天，苏联工业企业全体职工都以主人公的态度积极地参加了各企业五年计划的讨论和制定。各企业工人、工程师、技师、职员在讨论时提出了许多宝贵的建议。哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂职工提出了1，500多个关于提高劳动生产率和增加产品的建议。列宁格勒斯大林金属制造厂职工建议把某些品种的产品移交别的工厂生产，让这个工厂集中生产透平，这样到1960年可以增产一倍半透平，提高劳动生产率一倍，降低透平的成本约45％。
    苏联第六个五年计划草案就是这样在广大群众的高度政治积极性和丰富生产经验的结实基础上产生的。在制定计划草案时候，苏共中央考虑了许多工业企业和集体农庄单位的建议。包括工人、集体农庄庄员、专家、科学家在内的广大人们参加了这些建议的准备和制定。他们帮助了党中央委员会更加圆满地规定在第六个五年计划期间发展国民经济各部门的任务和查明各部门中的巨大潜力。
    在第六个五年计划草案公布以后，苏联全国人民在讨论它的时候，继续发掘国民经济中潜在的可能性，发动争取提前完成1956年计划的竞赛，并且潮水一般提出各种有利于苏联生产力发展的具体建议。在党的会议上，在群众大会上，在真理报和地方党报上，人们提出许许多多补充意见。在莫斯科的物理数学博士克拉新提议，为共和国的科学院和苏联科学院分院以及高等学校设置几个实验用的核子反应堆，扩设研究和平利用原子能的科学机关。马格尼托哥尔斯克工程师科托夫提议，建立更多的大铁矿，以便供给乌拉尔、西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦的钢铁企业更多的铁矿石。苏共古比雪夫州委书记叶费列莫夫提议，特别注意进一步发展伏尔加河流域的石油和煤气工业，在五年中在古比雪夫州勘探的石油资源要增长四、五倍，采油量要增长二倍半到三倍。斯大林格勒拖拉机厂厂长西尼真提议，另建一个生产发动机的专门工厂，使这个拖拉机厂的产量提高为1955年的四倍。列宁格勒基洛夫工厂旋工卡拉薛夫提议，指示经济的、党的、苏维埃的、工会的组织，保证改进对生产革新者的工作，注意最迅速地采用有价值的发明和合理化建议。科克切诺夫州国营农场管理局局长斯米尔诺夫提议，在新开垦地区建设通常的铁路比窄轨铁路更有利。“花园和果园”刊物总编辑纳查罗夫提议，向所有集体农庄和国营农场（除极北地区以外）推荐制定发展果园（葡萄园）的远景计划，由苏联国家计划委员会制定全国发展果园和葡萄园的远景计划。莫斯科二四六中学校长潘非洛娃提议，创立为实现综合技术教育任务所必需的物质条件，让工业企业不是志愿地而是义务地参加这方面的工作。……人民群众的积极性上涨着。无疑的，它将随着第六个五年计划的实施继续上涨。
    苏联第六个五年计划是领导和群众，党和人民的全面智慧的结晶。
    这一切说明：这几年来，苏联人民更加紧密地团结在苏联共产党和它的中央委员会的周围，热情更加奋发地向着共产主义社会迈进。
