There are currently 10 million young and middle-aged members of the Communist Youth League in rural areas nationwide. During the high tide of agricultural cooperation, Youth League organizations in rural areas across the country universally launched work to establish and consolidate the League. Since last autumn, rural League organizations in various regions have admitted more than 2 million outstanding young people into the League. It is expected that the consolidation of grassroots League organizations in rural areas can be brought to a close this spring, with the exception of a few regions.

During the consolidation process, all regions purged a small number of bad elements who had infiltrated the League, strengthened and established the League's leadership core, and improved the quality of the League. According to statistics from 7,944 League branches in the Yue Dong Administrative Region of Guangdong Province that had undergone consolidation, advanced branches increased from 23% to 51%. Branches with poor work ability also decreased from 19.7% to 4.6%. In Wuchang County, Hubei Province, after the third district underwent League consolidation, the number of branch committee members increased from the original 59 to 89, of which poor and lower-middle peasant components accounted for 77%, and 45 were newly elected outstanding League members.

After the establishment and consolidation of League organizations in various regions, they have become more active in socialist transformation and agricultural production. In Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province, among the 19 League branches that underwent consolidation, the number of League members participating in agricultural cooperatives increased from 40% to 99.4% of the total number of League members. After consolidation, the League branch in Ba Basin Township, Fusui County, Guangxi Province, organized more than 700 young people and teenagers to repair bridges and roads, and also cultivated 400 mu of youth forest, planting more than 200,000 trees. At the beginning of the cooperative consolidation in 11 townships including Beiyuze in Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, the League branches organized 126 youth shock teams for activities such as digging wells, accumulating fertilizer, reclaiming wasteland, and fighting sparrows. In half a month, they dug 176 wells, excavated 32 canals, and accumulated 77,136 carts of fertilizer. The League branch in Songdian Township also assisted the Party organization in making a comprehensive plan for the literacy campaign in the entire township during the League consolidation work, and added 5 civil schools in the township. Now the number of people participating in cultural studies in the township has increased from the original 16 to 189. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国农村中青年团员已有1，000万名
    目前全国农村中的青年团员已经有1，000万名。在农业合作化高潮中，各地农村青年团组织普遍展开了建团和整团工作。从去年秋季以来，各地农村团组织吸收了200多万名优秀青年入团。预计今年春季除个别地区外，农村团的基层组织的整顿工作可以告一段落。
    各地在整团中，都清洗了少数混进团内的坏分子，健全和树立了团的领导核心，提高了团的质量。据广东省粤东行政区经过整顿的7，944个团支部的统计，先进支部已经由23％增加到51％。工作能力较差的支部也由19.7％减少为4.6％。湖北省武昌县第三区经过整团后，支部委员由原来的59名增加到89名，其中贫农和下中农成分的支部委员占77％，有45名是新选上的优秀团员。
    各地团组织经过建团和整团以后，在农业社会主义改造和农业生产中更加活跃。黑龙江省望奎县经过整顿的19个团支部中，参加农业合作社的团员人数由占团员总数的40％增加到99.4％。广西省扶绥县巴盆乡的团支部在整顿以后，就组织了700多名青年、少年修桥、补路，还营造了青年林400亩，植树20多万株。山西省屯留县北鱼泽等11个乡的团支部在整社开始的时候就组织了打井、积肥、开荒、打麻雀等126个青年突击队，他们在半个月的时间内，就打了176眼井，挖了32条渠，还积了77，136车肥料。宋店乡的团支部在整团工作中还协助党组织对全乡扫盲工作进行全面规划，在全乡增设了5座民校。现在全乡参加文化学习的人数由原来的16人增加到189人。　（新华社）
