Xinhua News Agency, Berlin Dispatch: Bonn News: The two main partners of the West German Federal Government coalition—the Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democratic Party—have publicly declared a breakdown.

    After holding an executive committee meeting on February 24, Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union announced its decision to expel the Free Democratic Party from the government coalition, ending its seven-year alliance with the Free Democratic Party headed by Dehler. However, a spokesman for the Adenauer government stated that the Christian Democratic Union would allow those former Free Democratic Party government ministers who have declared their withdrawal from the Free Democratic Party to remain in the Adenauer government.

    Free Democratic Party Vice-Chairmen Mende and Becker announced at a press conference in Bonn on February 23 that the Free Democratic Party's executive committee would hold a meeting in Stuttgart soon to discuss formally expelling some pro-Adenauer rebels from the party. These rebels are 16 members of the Federal Assembly (Note: There are 53 Free Democratic Party members in the Federal Assembly), including 4 who are Adenauer government ministers.

    Free Democratic Party Chairman Dehler said in a speech in Stuttgart on February 24 that the differences of opinion between him and Adenauer were mainly on foreign policy issues. He criticized Adenauer for lacking determination on the issue of German reunification. He said: "For 10 years, we have focused our attention entirely on the West, as if the East did not exist." He reiterated his proposal for direct negotiations with the Soviet Union.

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 27th Dispatch: Bonn News: After the Free Democratic Party in the West German government coalition split with Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union and withdrew from the government, most of the Free Democratic Party organizations in the West German states announced their support for the Free Democratic Party leadership headed by Dehler.

    According to Reuters, the Free Democratic Party's senior body in Hesse held an emergency meeting in Bad Nauheim near Frankfurt on February 25. The meeting refused to recognize Juhler, a splitist, as chairman of the Free Democratic Party's Hesse organization. Juhler has been forced to relinquish the chairmanship and leave the Free Democratic Party. The meeting elected Vice-Chairman Koch, who opposed Juhler's split action, as chairman. Juhler was the leader of the 16 pro-Adenauer members who declared their withdrawal from the Free Democratic Party on February 23.

    西德政府联盟公开破裂
    新华社柏林电　波恩消息：西德联邦政府联盟的两个主要伙伴——基督教民主联盟和自由民主党已经公开宣告破裂。
    阿登纳的基督教民主联盟在2月24日举行了一次执行委员会会议以后宣布，它决定从政府联盟中逐出自由民主党，结束它同以戴勒为首的自由民主党七年来的联盟关系。但是，阿登纳政府的发言人表示，基督教民主联盟将让那些已经声明退出自由民主党的原自由民主党的政府部长仍旧留在阿登纳政府内任职。
    自由民主党副主席蒙德和贝克尔2月23日在波恩举行的一次记者招待会上宣布，自由民主党的执行委员会将在最近在斯图加特举行会议，讨论把党内一些亲阿登纳的反叛分子正式开除出党的问题。这些反叛分子是16个联邦议院的议员（按：联邦议院中的自由民主党议员共有53人），其中有4个人是阿登纳政府部长。
    自由民主党主席戴勒2月24日在斯图加特发表演讲说，在他同阿登纳之间存在的意见分歧主要是关于外交政策问题。他抨击阿登纳对于德国统一问题没有决心。他说：“10年来我们把我们的注意力完全集中在西方，就好像东方并不存在一样”。他重申同苏联举行直接谈判的主张。
    新华社柏林27日电　波恩消息：在西德政府联盟中的自由民主党同阿登纳的基督教民主联盟分裂和退出政府以后，西德各州绝大部分的自由民主党组织都宣布支持以戴勒为首的自由民主党的领导机构。
    据路透社报道，自由民主党黑森州高级机构2月25日在法兰克福附近的巴特瑙海姆举行了一次紧急会议。会议拒绝承认分裂分子尤勒为自由民主党黑森州组织主席。尤勒已经被迫放弃主席职位，并且脱离自由民主党。会议推选反对尤勒的分裂行动的副主席科震特担任主席。尤勒是2月23日声明退出自由民主党的16个亲阿登纳分子的领导人。
