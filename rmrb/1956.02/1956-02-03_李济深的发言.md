Comrades Chairman, Committee Members, and Comrades:

　　I wholeheartedly support Chairman Zhou Enlai’s political report and fully agree with Vice Chairman Guo Moruo’s report on "The Mission of Intellectuals in the Upsurge of Socialist Revolution," Vice Chairman Chen Shutong’s report on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and Vice Chairman Dong Biwu’s report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries. All comrades of our Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) must work harder together with the people of the whole country to implement them.

　　The development of our country’s socialist cause is extremely encouraging. Our country’s first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy will be completed a year or six months ahead of schedule. The nationwide primary form of agricultural cooperation will be basically completed this year, and the advanced form of agricultural cooperation will be basically completed in 1957 or the first half of 1958. The cooperation of handicrafts and the overall public-private partnership of private industrial and commercial enterprises will also be basically completed this year or early next year. These circumstances fully demonstrate that our socialist construction and socialist transformation are progressing very rapidly, and a prosperous and strong socialist country can certainly be built within the next 12 years.

　　At present, in the rural areas across the country, the power of the cooperative economy has exceeded that of the small-scale peasant economy. This change in production relations will inevitably lead to an upsurge in national agricultural production and promote the accelerated development of various economic sectors of the country, as well as the scientific, cultural, educational, health, and political and legal sectors. Therefore, the country urgently needs many intellectuals and requires all intellectuals to contribute their talents to various sectors. In the future, every intellectual can give full play to their strengths, and the breadth of their future is unprecedented and impossible in any past era.

　　The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have always attached importance to intellectuals and have long formulated and implemented a policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals. There is no doubt that in the future, party and government leaders at all levels will more conscientiously implement this policy, respect intellectuals more, care for them more, help them progress more, and arrange their work more properly. At the same time, we also earnestly hope that intellectuals will unreservedly contribute their wisdom and talents to the socialist cause of the motherland.

　　From the perspective of the RCCK, we must more broadly connect with the original Kuomintang and those with historical ties to the original Kuomintang, especially the middle and upper strata among them, so that they can play their due role in the socialist cause. At the same time, we must also eliminate the counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated in order to consolidate the unity within the people.

　　The brilliant achievements of our socialist cause are also the strengthening of the forces defending peace. The increasing strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the increasing number of countries willing to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the advocacy of easing international tensions have gained increasing support among the people of the world. The increasing unity of anti-colonialists and the increasing development of the anti-colonialist movement, these facts powerfully demonstrate that the forces of world peace are incomparably strong. Such an international situation is conducive to our socialist construction. But it absolutely cannot be said that the threat of war no longer exists, and we can rest easy. The facts of imperialists’ external aggression still exist, especially the US imperialists’ armed interference in our country’s internal affairs, the occupation of our country’s territory of Taiwan, directly and seriously threatens our socialist construction. We must make the armed forces of US imperialism withdraw from our country’s territory and territorial waters, and make Taiwan return to the embrace of the motherland, in order to ensure our peaceful construction, ensure peace in the Far East and world peace.

　　The reason why Taiwan has not yet returned to the embrace of the motherland is entirely due to the US imperialists colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to use force to contain the people of Taiwan. The people of Taiwan love the motherland, as evidenced by their continuous resistance to Japanese imperialist rule over the past decades. Today's motherland has become one of the world's leading powerful countries, and the people of all ethnic groups across the country are living a free and happy life. It is understandable that the people of Taiwan are even more eager to return to the embrace of the motherland. We really cannot sit idly by and watch the people of Taiwan being oppressed, bullied, and enslaved, living a life worse than animals. We must do everything possible to liberate Taiwan and rescue the people of Taiwan from their suffering.

　　The Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, now is the time to consider right and wrong, and advantages and disadvantages. Is it better to be proud and dignified people of a great motherland, or to be tools of US imperialist aggression? Returning to the motherland means a bright future, following the US-Chiang clique means certain death. Perhaps they understand this in their hearts, but they are enduring and waiting helplessly under the coercion of the US-Chiang evil forces. Their depressed, hesitant, and eager to break free feelings are also understandable. We welcome them to abandon darkness and embrace the light.

　　No matter who it is, no matter how big a crime he has committed in the past, as long as he suddenly realizes the truth, cuts off relations with US imperialism, and returns to the big family of the motherland, we can forgive his past.

　　The country’s territory must remain complete. The unity of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is the main condition for overcoming all difficulties and achieving great achievements. Taiwan must return to the embrace of the motherland. Liberating Taiwan and realizing the complete reunification of the great motherland is a major task of the people of the whole country and also a major task of our RCCK comrades. We must follow the instructions of Chairman Zhou Enlai, do everything possible, and exert all our strength to strive to complete this major task!

    李济深的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心拥护周恩来主席的政治报告并完全同意郭沫若副主席的“在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命”的报告、陈叔通副主席关于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的报告、董必武副主席关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告。我们民革全体同志一定和全国人民一道，加强努力，贯彻执行。
    我国社会主义事业的发展情况，是十分使人欢欣鼓舞的。我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划将提前一年或半年完成，全国范围的初级形式的农业合作化将于今年内基本完成，高级形式的农业合作化将于1957年内或1958年上半年基本完成，手工业的合作化和私营工商业的全行业公私合营也将于今年内或明年初基本完成。这些情况，充分说明了我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造是进展得非常迅速的，在今后的12年内一定可以建成一个繁荣强大的社会主义国家。
    目前在全国农村中，合作经济的势力已超过了小农经济的势力。这种生产关系的改变，必然引起全国农业生产的高潮，并促进国家各个经济部门、以及科学、文化、教育、卫生部门和政法部门的加速发展。因此，国家迫切地需要很多的知识分子，要求所有的知识分子都贡献其才能于各部门事业。今后每一个知识分子都可以尽量发挥其所长，其前途的广阔，是过去任何时代所不曾有也不可能有的。
    中国共产党和毛主席一向重视知识分子，早就制定了并施行了对知识分子团结、教育和改造的政策。没有疑问，今后各级党政领导将更加认真地贯彻这一政策，对知识分子将更加尊重，更加关怀，更加帮助他们进步，更加妥贴地安排他们的工作。同时，我们也殷切地盼望知识分子毫无保留地把自己的智慧才能贡献给祖国的社会主义事业。
    从民革来说，我们必须更广泛地联系原国民党及与原国民党有历史关系的人士，特别是其中的中上层人士，使他们在社会主义事业中发挥应有的作用。同时，我们也必须肃清混进来的反革命分子，以巩固人民内部的团结。
    我们社会主义事业的辉煌成就，同时就是保卫和平力量的增强。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的日益强大，愿意遵守五项原则和平共处的国家越来越多，和缓国际紧张局势的主张已经在全世界人民当中得到越来越多的支持，反殖民主义者的日益团结和反殖民主义运动的日益开展，这些事实有力地说明了世界和平力量是强大无比的。这样的国际形势，对我们的社会主义建设是有利的。但绝对不能说战争威胁已不存在，我们已可以高枕无忧。帝国主义者向外侵略的事实仍然不少存在着，特别是美帝国主义者以武力干涉我国的内政，侵占我国的领土台湾，直接地严重地威胁着我们的社会主义建设。我们必须使美帝国主义的武力撤出我国的领土领海，使台湾回到祖国的怀抱，以保障我国的和平建设，保障远东和平和世界和平。
    台湾之所以至今还没有回到祖国的怀抱，完全由于美帝国主义者勾结蒋介石集团，以武力箝制台湾人民。台湾人民是热爱祖国的，过去数十年不断地反抗日本帝国主义的统治就足以证明。今天的祖国已成为世界上头等强大国家之一，全国各族人民都过着自由幸福的生活，台湾人民更加迫切地要求回到祖国怀抱的心情，是可以理解的。我们对于台湾人民之被压迫被欺侮被奴役，过着牛马不如的生活，实在不能坐视。我们必须想尽一切办法来解放台湾，出台湾人民于水深火热之中。
    台湾的国民党军政人员，现在是考虑是非利害的时候了。昂昂然做一个伟大的祖国的人民好呀，抑或做美帝国主义的侵略工具好呢？回祖国来则前途远大，跟美蒋走则死路一条，也许他们是心里明白的，不过他们在美蒋恶势力裹胁之下，一时无可奈何而忍耐等待罢了。他们苦闷彷徨，祈求解脱的心情，也是可以理解的。我们是欢迎他们弃暗投明的。
    不论是谁，也不管他以前犯过多大罪过，只要他幡然觉悟，割断和美帝国主义的关系，重新回到祖国的大家庭，我们就可以不究既往。
    国家的领土必须保持完整。全国人民在中国共产党领导下的团结一致是战胜一切困难取得伟大成就的主要条件。台湾是一定要回到祖国怀抱的。解放台湾、实现伟大祖国的完全统一，是全国人民的重大任务，也是我们民革同志的重大任务。我们必须遵循周恩来主席的指示，想尽一切方法、出尽一切力量，为完成这个重大任务而奋斗！
