    Zhang Shirang's Speech
    Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:
    After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's report and the reports of the Vice-Chairmen the day before yesterday, I wholeheartedly endorse them and will lead my fellow believers to diligently follow and implement them.
    I am a cleric of the Shanghai Diocese of the Catholic Church. For a long time, I was deceived and oppressed by imperialist elements and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique. In the past, I had no freedom of thought, speech, or action. It was not until the government's wise measures on September 8th last year, when the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique was arrested, that I gained liberation. This time, the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference specially invited me to participate in this plenary session, and I have seen the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, as well as the magnificent capital of the motherland. I not only feel infinitely honored but also extremely excited! Let me represent the 150,000 Catholics and over 70 clerics of the Shanghai Diocese to extend our highest respect and gratitude to our beloved Chairman Mao!
    After the liberation of Shanghai, imperialist elements hiding within the church, such as Ge Shouping and Caimeng, did their utmost to recommend Gong Pinmei as the Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese. At that time, the clergy and faithful of the Shanghai Diocese believed that Gong Pinmei, being a bishop of Chinese nationality, would be able to fulfill our wishes and benefit both the country and the church by leading us. Little did we know that he would collude with imperialist elements, obey their orders, organize a group to oppose the government, spread rumors to undermine government policies, slander various social reforms and patriotic movements, and secretly send henchmen to various dioceses to threaten patriotic clerics and believers, and to gather secret intelligence about the country, sending it abroad through privately set up radio stations and coded telegrams. Within the diocese, he incited young believers to oppose the government and strike at the patriotic and religious activities of believers, causing many young believers to abandon their studies, embark on the road of counter-revolution, and ruin their own futures. In short, the crimes committed by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique are too numerous to mention. When the imperialist element Ge Shouping (the head of the Shanghai Diocese Jesuit Society) was expelled from the country by the government to Hong Kong, Gong Pinmei wrote to him, saying, "I hope you remain healthy as ever, and will soon lead us publicly again. In fact, I know that you have never given up leadership." From this letter, it can be seen that Gong Pinmei and his counter-revolutionary clique were completely in league with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. They hoped that the United States and Chiang would soon be restored, and that imperialist elements could come again to ride on our heads and command everything. Gong Pinmei was the leader of the Shanghai Diocese, yet he hoped that the imperialist element Ge Shouping would "lead" everything, which shows his intentions. Our church's seminaries and cathedrals were supposed to be sacred places, but the Gong Pinmei group used them to harbor major traitors and special agents such as Xu Ruoyu and Deng Jiajun. They are enemies of the people, criminals. Gong Pinmei and others, by protecting criminals in this way, were violating the law of the country and defiling the holy place, which is truly intolerable. The People's Government's punishment of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique according to the law of the country is entirely in line with the interests of the people and also entirely in line with the requirements of the church. My colleagues and I were threatened and deceived by the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique in the past. We did not have the courage to stand up and fight against them. We made many mistakes, causing much loss to the country and the church, and we should also be severely criticized.
    For more than four months, all the clerics in the Shanghai Catholic Church have received patient education from the People's Government, recognized the ugly faces of imperialism and counter-revolution, and have been able to stand up, draw a clear line between themselves and the enemy, distinguish between right and wrong, and have personally signed and published a letter to all clergy and believers in the country. The broad masses of Catholics in the Shanghai Diocese have also enthusiastically and unreservedly participated in the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation in recent years. This is a united and further patriotic manifestation of the Shanghai Catholic community after the eradication of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique. Although our patriotic performance is still lagging behind that of people from all walks of life, we believe that since the obstacles set up by imperialism and counter-revolution within our Shanghai church have been destroyed, and we have taken a big step on the road of anti-imperialism and patriotism, we will certainly have more, greater, and better patriotic performances in the future under the correct leadership of the People's Government and with the strong help of people from all walks of life.
    Now our clergy in Shanghai are concentrating on studying to further understand the principles of patriotism, and our thinking will be greatly improved. Especially after listening to Vice-Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionary elements at this conference, I deeply realized the sinister and vicious nature of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang in using our church to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. The elimination of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique is only a preliminary victory. The enemy will certainly not be reconciled to defeat, and we must remain vigilant!
    After returning to my pastoral duties, I must widely convey the spirit and resolutions of this conference, unite the Catholic community in my diocese and throughout the country, and not allow imperialists and counter-revolutionary elements to use our pure church again. I am 76 years old this year. I love my motherland, I love my church, and I want to learn from the example of Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a patriotic elder in our church, to make good use of my remaining old age, to run a Catholic Church that conforms to the interests of the Chinese people, and to promote the clergy and faithful in our diocese to love the motherland, study hard, actively contribute their strength to the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland, and strive for the early liberation of Taiwan. Finally, I wish the People's Republic of China longevity! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!

    张士琅的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    前天我听了周恩来主席和各位副主席的报告后，我衷心地拥护，并且要领导我的信友们勉励遵照实行。
    我是天主教上海教区的一个神职人员，长期受到帝国主义分子和龚品梅反革命集团的欺骗和压迫，过去在思想、言论、行动上一概不得自由，自从去年9月8日，政府英明的措施，把龚品梅反革命集团加以逮捕以后，才获得了解放。这次全国政协常务委员会特邀我来参加这个全体大会，并且见到了伟大的领袖毛泽东主席，以及辉煌灿烂的祖国的首都，我不但感到无限光荣，同时也感到万分的兴奋！让我代表上海教区15万天主教友及70多名神职人员，向敬爱的毛主席致最崇高的敬礼和感谢！
    上海解放以后，暗藏在教会内的帝国主义分子格寿平及才尔孟等，竭力荐举龚品梅任上海教区的主教，当时我们上海教区的神职人员和众教友，以为龚品梅是国籍主教，他来领导我们，必能满足我们的愿望，为祖国为教会都有好处；岂知他竟和帝国主义分子勾结在一起，唯帝国主义之命是听，组织了反对政府的集团，专门散布谣言破坏政府政策，诬蔑社会各项改革及爱国运动，并秘密派出爪牙，到各教区威胁爱国神职人员和教徒，刺探国家的机密情报，用私设电台及密码电报送往国外；在教区内煽动青年教徒反对政府，和打击教徒爱国爱教的行动，使不少的青年教徒荒弃学业，走上反革命的绝路，断送了自己的前途。总之，龚品梅反革命集团所犯的罪行是罄竹难书的。当帝国主义分子格寿平（是上海教区耶稣会负责人）被政府驱逐出境到香港后，龚品梅即写信给他说：“希望你健康如恒，不久仍会公开领导我们，实际上我深知你从未放弃领导。”从这封信上可见龚品梅及其反革命集团，完全是美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的一路人，他们希望美蒋不久会复辟，帝国主义分子可再来骑在我们头上指挥一切，龚品梅是上海教区领导人，而希望帝国主义分子格寿平来“领导”一切，可见其居心也。我们教会的修院和教堂，本是圣洁的地方，而龚品梅集团竟利用来窝藏大汉奸大特务徐若愚、邓家俊等；他们是人民的仇敌，是犯罪的人，龚品梅等这样包庇罪犯，是犯国法的，也是玷污圣地的，实在令人忍无可忍。人民政府对龚品梅反革命集团处以国法，是完全符合人民的利益，也完全符合教会的要求的。我和我的同道们，过去被龚品梅反革命集团威胁和蒙蔽，没有勇气站立起来和他们斗争，犯了许多错误，造成国家和教会的许多损失，也应当受到严厉的批判。
    我们上海天主教全体神职人员，4个多月来，受到人民政府耐心的教育，认识了帝国主义和反革命的丑恶面目，也都能站立起来，和敌人划清界限，辨明是非，并已亲笔签名发表了告全国神长教友书。上海教区广大的天主教友，在最近国家的各项社会主义建设和社会主义改造中，也都已热情而毫无顾虑的积极参加，这是我们上海天主教界，在肃清龚品梅反革命集团以后，团结一致，进一步的爱国表现。虽然比起各界人民来，我们的爱国表现还显得落后，但是我们相信，帝国主义和反革命在我们上海教会内所设的障碍既已摧毁了，我们在反帝爱国的道路上既已迈开了大步，今后在人民政府的正确领导下，和各界人民的大力帮助下，我们一定可以有更多、更大、更好的爱国表现。
    现在我们上海的神职人员，正在集中学习，进一步认识爱国的道理，我们的思想将有很大的提高；尤其我在这次大会上，听了董必武副主席的关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告以后，深深地认识到帝国主义和蒋匪帮利用我们教会进行反革命活动的阴险毒辣。肃清龚品梅反革命集团只是初步的胜利，敌人一定不甘心失败，我们还应当提高警惕！
    我回到自己教务岗位后，一定要普遍传达这次大会的精神和决议，团结我教区以及全国的天主教界，不允许帝国主义者及反革命分子再利用我们纯洁的教会。我今年76岁，我爱我的祖国，我爱我的教会，我要学习我教爱国老人马相伯老先生的榜样，用好我的残余的老年，办好符合中国人民利益的天主教会，并推动我们教区的神职人员和广大教徒热爱祖国，好好学习，在祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造中，积极地贡献出自己的力量，并为早日解放台湾而努力奋斗。最后谨祝中华人民共和国万岁！中国共产党万岁！敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！
