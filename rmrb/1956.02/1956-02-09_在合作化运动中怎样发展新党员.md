How to Develop New Party Members in the Cooperative Movement
Li Bingxi

During the high tide of the cooperative movement, many areas urgently needed to develop a group of Party members, but very few were developed, or even none at all. Many Party branches emphasized that there were no suitable candidates for Party membership development. Is this actually the case? The achievements of the Shufeng Township branch in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province in actively building the Party prove that this is not the case.

When the number of agricultural cooperatives in Shufeng Township had grown from the original 7 to 35, while the number of Party members in the cooperatives was still only 9, the Party branch and all Party members in the township also held conservative ideas. For example, some Party members worried that they would be responsible if problematic people were developed, and advocated developing as few as possible; other Party members believed that women would lag behind once they had children, and that young people were prone to inconsistency in their work, and advocated not developing women and young people.

With the help of the district committee, the branch criticized these conservative ideas, and pointed out that 186 activists had emerged from the 28 newly established cooperatives in the township, and that the targets for Party membership development should mainly be found among them. After unifying the thinking of Party members, the branch immediately studied and formulated the 1956 Party building work plan. Based on the situation of new and old activists, 52 people were selected as candidates for Party membership development in 1956, and it was decided that 11 of them should undergo further training and could be developed into Party members immediately. The Party building work in this township was then launched in conjunction with the cooperative movement.

Will developing Party members in the cooperative movement affect the quality of Party members? The experience of the Shufeng Township branch proves that as long as the standards for Party members are truly grasped and the procedures for joining the Party are strictly followed, the quality of Party members can be guaranteed.

First of all, the branch conducted education on revolutionary vigilance among Party members in Party building. In addition to leading Party members to study materials on preventing class enemies from infiltrating the Party, it also mobilized all Party members to participate in a district-wide Party member conference. At this meeting, the bad element Wu Changgen, who had infiltrated the Party, was exposed and struggled against, and the slackness of the Party member who introduced Wu Changgen into the Party was criticized. After the meeting, the branch organized everyone to discuss the specific situation of the township, so that everyone realized that the targets for Party membership development must first be selected from outstanding elements with clear backgrounds from among poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, among the 11 newly admitted Party members, 7 were poor peasants and 4 were new and old lower-middle peasants. They were all backbone elements in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and 10 of them were directors of cooperatives.

Secondly, the branch conducted a careful investigation when determining the targets for Party membership development. The branch committee first ranked the activists, determined the targets for development and the order of development, and then submitted them to the branch general meeting for discussion. After the targets for Party membership development were determined, the branch assigned specific personnel to be responsible for cultivation and investigation, and established a registration card system for Party building targets. The Party member responsible for cultivation would fill in the registration card with the Party building target's class background, personal history, social relations, and main performance in various movements, so that the branch could understand his situation in a timely and comprehensive manner. The understanding of Party member targets did not rely entirely on registration cards. Sometimes, the branch also reviewed the materials on the registration cards. The method of review was either to talk to the person himself; or to talk to Party members, activists, and the masses who were familiar with his situation. For example, when the branch reviewed the materials on the first batch of registration cards, it found that one person had historical problems that had not been clearly explained to the Party, and his name was removed from the list of Party member development targets. Due to the strict review, the 11 newly developed Party members were clear in politics and history.

Finally, the branch conducted education on the standards of a Communist Party member and the future of socialism for the targets of Party membership development. The branch gave them 13 Party lessons, systematically educating them on the basic knowledge of the Party. The branch also conducted individual education work targeting the thinking of Party member development targets. This combination of Party lessons and individual education significantly improved their socialist consciousness. After Xu Renshi studied the eight questions of the Communist Party member standard, he understood that a Communist Party member must be selfless and checked his selfish and self-interested thoughts of recording more work points for himself, and immediately canceled the extra work points he had recorded in the past. Zhu Jianming became arrogant, complacent, and dictatorial because he had achieved certain results in running the cooperative, which caused disunity among the cooperative cadres and confusion in the cooperative's production management; after being educated through Party lessons and individual talks, he realized his mistake of arrogance and complacency, made a review at the cooperative management committee meeting, and inspired everyone to launch criticism and self-criticism. The cooperative cadres were united, and the chaotic phenomenon in production was eliminated.

As a result of the township branch's active Party building work, within a period of less than two months, 11 Party members were developed on the premise of ensuring the quality of Party members. In addition, 3 mature Party building targets were cultivated, and preliminary Party education was carried out for 52 Party building targets. The facts tell us that in the cooperative movement, actively cultivating a large number of activists and actively developing new Party members is not only necessary but also possible. Rural Party organizations should overcome their conservative ideas on the issue of Party building, and take on the work of cultivating activists and developing new Party members according to needs and possibilities.

    在合作化运动中怎样发展新党员
    李炳希
    在合作化运动的高潮中，不少地区很需要发展一批党员，可是发展得很少，甚至根本没有发展。不少党支部强调没有发展党员的对象。实际情况是不是这样呢？浙江省绍兴县蜀风乡支部积极建党的成绩证明并不是这么回事。
    当蜀风乡的农业合作社已经由原来的7个发展到35个而合作社中的党员还只有9名的时候，这个乡的党支部和全体党员，也有保守思想。例如，有的党员担心发展了有问题的人自己要负责，就主张发展得越少越好；还有的党员认为妇女有了小孩要落后，青年在工作中好犯冷热病，就主张不发展妇女和青年。
    支部在区委的帮助下，批判了这些保守思想，并且指出，全乡新办起的28个合作社中已经涌现出了186名积极分子，发展党员的对象主要应该从他们中间去找。在统一了党员的思想以后，支部马上研究和制定了1956年的建党工作规划。根据新老积极分子的情况，挑选了52人作为1956年的发展党员的对象，并确定其中的11人再进行一些培养工作，马上可以发展为党员。这个乡的建党工作就结合合作化运动展开了。
    在合作化运动中发展党员，会不会影响党员的质量呢？蜀风乡支部的经验证明，只要切实掌握了党员标准，严格履行了入党手续，是能够保证党员的质量的。
    首先，支部在建党中对党员进行了革命警惕性的教育，除领导党员学习有关防止阶级敌人混入党内的材料外，还动员全体党员参加了一次全区党员大会。在这个会上，揭发和斗争了混入党内的坏分子吴长根，并且批评了介绍吴长根入党的党员的麻痹思想。会后，支部又组织大家作了讨论，联系本乡的具体情况，使大家认识到发展党员的对象必须首先从贫农和下中农中历史清楚的优秀分子里边去挑选。因此在新吸收的11名党员中，就有7名是贫农，4名是新老下中农，他们都是互助合作运动中的骨干分子，其中并有10名是合作社的主任。
    其次，支部在确定发展党员对象的时候，还进行了慎重的考察工作。支部委员会先把积极分子排了队，确定发展的对象和发展的先后次序，然后提交支部大会讨论。发展党员的对象确定后，支部就指定专人负责培养、考察，并建立建党对象的登记卡片制度，由负责培养的党员把建党对象的出身成份、本人历史、社会关系和各项运动中的主要表现填入登记卡片，以便支部及时地、全面地了解他的情况。对党员对象的了解，并不完全依靠登记卡片，有时，支部还对登记卡片的材料进行复查。复查的办法是或者找本人谈话；或者找熟悉他情况的党员积极分子和群众谈话。例如，支部在复查第一批登记卡片的材料的时候，发现有一个人历史上有问题，一直没有向党交代清楚，就在党员发展对象的名单上划掉了他的名字。由于经过严格的审查，新发展的11名党员，在政治上和历史上都是清楚的。
    最后，支部对发展党员的对象进行了共产党员标准和社会主义前途的教育。支部先后给他们上过13次党课，比较系统地向他们作了有关党的基本知识的教育。支部还针对发展党员对象的思想，进行了个别教育工作。这种上党课和个别教育相结合的办法，使他们的社会主义觉悟都有了显著的提高。徐仁士学习了共产党员标准的八个问题以后，懂得了一个共产党员必须是大公无私的，就检查了多给自己记工分的自私自利思想，并且立即把过去多记的工分取消了。祝鉴明因为自己办社取得了一定的成绩，就骄傲自满、独断专行起来，以致造成社干部之间的不团结和社内生产管理上的混乱；经过党课教育和个别谈话的教育之后，他认识了骄傲自满的错误，在社管理委员会上作了检讨，启发大家展开了批评和自我批评。社干部之间团结了，生产上的混乱现象也消除了。
    由于这个乡支部积极地进行建党工作的结果，在不到两个月的时间之内，在保证党员质量的前提下，就发展了党员11名，另外还培养了成熟的建党对象3名，并对52名建党对象进行了党的初步教育。事实告诉我们，在合作化运动中，积极地培养大批积极分子，积极地发展新党员，不但有必要，而且有可能。农村党组织都应该克服自己在建党问题上的保守思想，根据需要和可能，把培养积极分子和发展新党员的工作担当起来。
