    Strive to Catch Up with the Advanced
    By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin
    Last year, the Wuhan Municipal Textile Industry Bureau and the Textile Trade Union organized an inter-factory competition among five major cotton mills in the same types of work. This achieved great results, not only encouraging advanced enterprises to continue to progress, but more importantly, effectively urging and helping backward enterprises to catch up with advanced enterprises. The Zhenhuan Cotton Mill is a good example.
    Since the implementation of joint state-private ownership in 1950, the Zhenhuan Cotton Mill, due to its backward enterprise management, lagged behind other factories in terms of output, quality, cost, labor productivity, equipment utilization rate, and other indicators. People called this factory the "old laggard." However, the staff of this factory, including the leaders, attributed the backwardness entirely to unfavorable objective conditions. They said: "The machines are old, the workers are old, the technical level is low, and the cadre force is weak. What can we do to improve the factory?" Some people even consoled themselves by saying: "Even if we are backward now, it is still much better than a few years ago. We lost money in 1952, but we didn't lose money in 1953, and we even made a little money in 1954."
    In order to improve production, the workers had made many suggestions on production management, technical management, and so on, and asked the leaders to solve them. However, the leading staff said: "The backwardness of the factory is a long-term problem. It is more difficult than climbing to the sky to improve it now."
    In the first quarter of last year, the city's five major cotton mills launched an inter-factory competition in the same types of work in the opening and cleaning workshops. As a result of the competition, the Zhenhuan Cotton Mill performed very poorly, ranking last.
    Initially, the factory leaders believed that the failure of the competition was inevitable for this backward factory, so they felt at ease and did not find it strange. However, the workers' views were completely different. They studied the reasons for the failure of the competition, sent people to the winning factories to learn, and at the same time criticized the administration's unwillingness to support the competition movement and the practice of completely pushing the responsibility of leading the competition movement onto the trade union. This situation made the leaders uneasy. They considered: the masses are demanding to improve production, what should we do?
    At this time, the Wuhan Municipal Textile Bureau and the Textile Trade Union sent a working group to the Zhenhuan Cotton Mill to help the factory improve its backward enterprise management in the inter-factory competition movement of the same types of work. They first conducted general line education for the leaders, and at the same time assisted the leaders in convening a series of meetings of management personnel, technical personnel, and workers. Under the slogan of "promoting democracy and inspecting work," the masses put forward many opinions on the shortcomings of past work, such as lack of planning in production, technical personnel being divorced from the masses, not paying attention to learning advanced experience, lax labor discipline, and lack of a responsibility system. The leaders were greatly educated. They realized that the fundamental reason for the backwardness of the enterprise was not unfavorable objective conditions, but insufficient subjective efforts, not relying on the masses, and not giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. They criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking that had long tolerated backwardness and hindered the progress of the masses.
      From the second quarter, the factory leaders changed their past lazy and conservative style and actively led the masses forward. They called on all management personnel, technical personnel, and workers to actively learn and promote advanced experience in the second quarter's inter-factory competition of the same types of work in the five major cotton mills, and to improve the level of enterprise management, first of all to strengthen technical management and solve the key problems in production. This call encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. Several specialized technical groups were established throughout the factory to actively solve the problems existing in the workshop. The opening and cleaning workshop and the carding workshop had been producing poorly for a long time due to abnormal and inconsistent process design and imbalance in the production of each process. The specialized technical group, combined with the advanced experience of opening (cleaning), steel (wire), and slurry (cloth) promoted by the Ministry of Textile Industry throughout the country, rectified the process design of each process and unified the specifications and standards; at the same time, workers were sent to advanced factories in the city to learn. After they returned, they created an advanced "one-dragon" operation method based on the situation in their own workshops. The Party committee and the trade union promptly summarized and promoted this operation method, setting off a wave of workers learning advanced techniques and improving technology. The administrative leaders also established and improved the raw cotton management system, the temperature and humidity management system, the process design management system, the class inventory system, and the shift handover system. As a result, there was a great change in production in the second quarter. The amount of cotton used per piece of yarn (mixed combed pure raw cotton) dropped from 393.27 jin in December 1954 to 386.3 jin in the second quarter. The fiber content of the waste cotton was also greatly reduced, and the chaotic and passive situation in production was initially reversed, laying a favorable foundation for the comprehensive completion of the state plan. In the second quarter's inter-factory competition of the same types of work in the five major cotton mills, the Zhenhuan Cotton Mill was rated second.
    This production achievement was a great encouragement to all the staff. However, they knew that at this time they had only initially changed the seriously backward situation in production, and they were still far from comprehensively improving the level of enterprise management. They wanted to continue to move forward. Under the impetus of the third and fourth quarter's inter-factory competition of the same types of work in the five major cotton mills, a factory-wide competition movement was launched. In order to ensure the realization of the competition indicators, they conscientiously implemented the "three points and three determinations" plan of the comprehensive management indicators issued by the Textile Bureau and the quarterly economic activity analysis meeting system; conscientiously promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method and Chen Shulan's doffing work method; strengthened the maintenance and upkeep of machinery; held mass waste inspections and launched a comprehensive saving movement; actively learned the advanced operation methods performed by the advanced experience promotion team formed by the advanced producers of the five major cotton mills jointly organized by the Textile Bureau and the Textile Trade Union. Due to the adoption of this series of important measures, the amount of cotton used in the fourth quarter (mixed combed pure raw cotton) has dropped to 383.28 jin, creating a record that has never been reached by any textile factory in the city; the quality standard product rate of each yarn count is 100%, and the unit labor cost of 21-count yarn has dropped from 135.82 yuan in December 1954 to 101.51 yuan, and the rate of substandard cloth has also dropped from 30% in 1954 to less than 1%.
    However, the leaders of the Zhenhuan Cotton Mill are not satisfied with the existing achievements. They know that there is still a gap compared with the production level of Wuhan's advanced cotton mills. For example, although the quality of cotton yarn has reached the first-class level, it is not yet consolidated; the product cost is still higher than that of advanced factories. Now they are organizing all the staff to continue to learn and promote advanced experience under the supervision and assistance of this year's inter-factory competition and competition of the same types of work in the five major cotton mills, so as to better improve quality, reduce costs, and strive to catch up with and surpass the advanced level.

    努力赶上先进
    本报记者　古维进
    去年武汉市纺织工业管理局和纺织工会组织5大纱厂开展厂际同工种竞赛，取得很大的成绩，不仅鼓励了先进企业继续前进，更重要的是有效地督促和帮助落后企业赶上先进企业。震寰纱厂就是一个很好的例子。
    震寰纱厂自1950年实行公私合营以来，由于企业管理工作落后，无论产量、质量、成本、劳动生产率、设备利用率等各种指标都落在其他厂的后面，人们都称这个厂是“老落后”。但是，这个厂的工作人员包括领导人员在内，却把落后完全归咎于客观条件不好。他们说：机器老，工人老，技术水平低，干部力量薄弱，有什么办法能把厂子搞好呢？有些人更自慰地说：“就算现在落后吧，总比前几年好得多了。1952年是赔钱的，1953年就不赔钱了，1954年还赚了一点钱。”
    职工们为了搞好生产，曾经对生产管理、技术管理等等提出许多意见，要求领导解决。但是，领导工作人员说：“厂子落后是长期性的问题，现在要想搞好，比登天还难。”
    去年第一季度全市5大纱厂开展厂际清花车间同工种竞赛。竞赛结果，震寰纱厂完成的指标很差，评为最末一名。
    开始，厂里的领导人员认为竞赛的失败对于这个落后厂说来是必然的，因而心安理得，并不觉得奇怪。但是，职工的看法完全不同。他们研究竞赛失败的原因，派人到竞赛胜利的工厂学习，同时对行政不愿支持竞赛运动，把领导竞赛运动的责任完全推在工会身上的做法提出批评。这种情况，使得领导人员不安了。他们考虑：群众要求搞好生产，该怎么办呢？
    这时候，武汉市纺织管理局和纺织工会等派工作组来到震寰纱厂，帮助这个厂在厂际同工种竞赛运动中改进落后的企业管理。他们首先对领导人员进行总路线的教育，同时协助领导召开管理人员、技术人员、工人等一系列的会议，在“发扬民主，检查工作”的口号下，群众对过去的工作缺点提出许多意见，如生产缺乏计划性，技术人员脱离群众，不重视学习先进经验，劳动纪律松懈，缺乏责任制度等，使领导人员受到很大的教育。他们认识到企业落后的根本原因，不是什么客观条件不好，而是主观努力不够，没有依靠群众，发挥群众的积极性和创造性。他们批判了长期以来容忍落后阻止群众前进的右倾保守思想。
      从第二季度开始，这个厂的领导人员改变了过去那种懒洋洋的保守作风，积极主动地领导群众前进。他们号召全体管理人员、技术人员和工人必须在第二季度5大纱厂厂际清花同工种竞赛里，积极学习和推广先进经验，提高企业管理水平，首先是加强技术管理，解决生产中的关键问题。这个号召鼓舞了群众的情绪。全厂成立了几个专业技术组，积极解决车间存在的问题。清花车间和梳棉车间，由于工艺设计不正常、不统一和各工序生产失调，长期生产不好。专业技术组结合纺织工业部在全国推广的清（花）、钢（丝）、浆（布）先进经验，整顿了各工序的工艺设计，统一规格标准；同时派工人到本市先进厂学习。他们回来以后，根据本车间的情况，创造了“一条龙”的先进操作方法。党委和工会及时地把这一操作方法加以总结推广，掀起了工人学习先进提高技术的浪潮。行政领导还建立和健全了原棉管理制度、温湿度管理制度、工艺设计管理制度、班盘存制度和交接班制度。这一来，第二季度的生产就有很大的转变。每件纱的用棉量（混合通扯纯原棉）由1954年12月份的393.27斤，降至第二季度386.3斤。落棉含纤维率也大大降低，并且初步扭转了生产上的混乱被动局面，为全面完成国家计划奠定了有利基础。第二季度五大纱厂厂际清花同工种竞赛结果，震寰纱厂被评为第二名。
    这一生产成绩，对于全体职工是极大的鼓舞。但是，他们知道，这时只是初步改变了生产上的严重落后局面，距离全面提高企业管理水平还差得很远。他们要继续前进。在第三季度和第四季度五大纱厂厂际同工种竞赛的推动下，开展了全厂范围的竞赛运动。为了保证竞赛指标实现，他们认真执行了纺织管理局所颁发的全面管理指标的“三分三定”方案和季度的经济活动分析会议制度；认真推广郝建秀工作方法和陈树兰的落纱工作方法；加强机器的保全保养工作；举行群众性的浪费大检查，开展全面节约运动；积极学习由纺织管理局和纺织工会联合组织五大纱厂的先进生产者成立的推广先进经验大队所表演的先进操作方法。由于采取了这一系列的重要措施，第四季度用棉量（混合通扯纯原棉）已降至383.28斤，创造了全市各纺织厂从未达到过的纪录；各支纱的质量标准品率都是100％，二十一支纱单位工费成本，由1954年12月份的135.82元降至101.51元，次布率也由1954年的30％降至1％以下。
    但是，震寰纱厂的领导人员并不满足现有的成绩。他们知道，比起武汉市先进纱厂的生产水平还有距离。如棉纱的质量虽然达到一等一级，但还不巩固；产品成本比先进厂还高。现在他们正在组织全体职工在今年的五大纱厂厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛的督促和帮助下，继续学习和推广先进经验，更好地提高质量，降低成本，争取赶上和超过先进水平。
