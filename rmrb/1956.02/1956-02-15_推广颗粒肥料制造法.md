    Promote the Manufacturing Method of Granular Fertilizer
    In order to meet the needs of farmers for fertilizer, the Santai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan Province, in addition to manufacturing and selling a portion of granular fertilizer, also actively mobilized and helped agricultural cooperatives to process and manufacture granular fertilizer themselves. They first implemented it in the Zunsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative. The Zunsheng Cooperative selected two members to go to the fertilizer factory of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to learn the principles and methods of manufacturing granular fertilizer. After learning, they went back and taught other members. When the cooperative was trial-producing, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative also sent cadres to assist. The members concentrated the stove soil, turf, manure, ditch mud, etc. in the cooperative, and mixed them with appropriate chemical fertilizers; within three days, they trial-produced 1,000 jin of granular fertilizer, which was of good quality and low cost. After the Santai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative helped the Zunsheng Agricultural Cooperative successfully trial-produce granular fertilizer, it also absorbed members from eight nearby cooperatives to learn. They plan to help agricultural cooperatives manufacture granular fertilizer on a large scale throughout the county this year.
    Agricultural cooperatives making their own granular fertilizer can take materials locally, process them locally, and use them locally, which reduces the transportation costs of fertilizer and also solves the problem of insufficient supply of commercial fertilizer from the Supply and Marketing Cooperative.

    推广颗粒肥料制造法
    四川省三台县供销合作社为了满足农民对肥料的需要，除了制造一部分颗粒肥料出售以外，并且积极发动和帮助农业合作社自己加工制造颗粒肥料。他们先在尊胜农业生产合作社试行。尊胜社选派了两个社员到供销社的肥料工场去学习制造颗粒肥料的原理和方法，学会了回去再向别的社员传授。在社里试制的时候，供销社还派了干部去协助。社员们把社里的灶泥、草皮、厩肥、阴沟泥等集中起来，配上适当的化学肥料；在三天内试制了1，000斤颗粒肥料，品质很好，成本也低。三台县供销社帮助尊胜农业合作社试制颗粒肥料成功以后，又吸收了附近八个社的社员来学习。他们准备今年在全县范围内，大量帮助农业合作社制造颗粒肥料。
    农业合作社自制颗粒肥料，可以就地取材、就地加工、就地使用，减少了肥料的运输费用，也解决了供销社商品肥料供应不足的问题。
