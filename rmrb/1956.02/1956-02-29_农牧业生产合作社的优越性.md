The Superiority of Agricultural and Pastoral Production Cooperatives
By our correspondent Lin Mo

In the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there is a lot of wasteland, with grasslands and pastures everywhere. Generally, Mongolian and Han farmers both cultivate land and raise many livestock. Especially the Mongolian farmers, who have always been good at managing animal husbandry.

To develop production in these areas, we should make full use of natural conditions and combine agriculture and animal husbandry well. In the past, some staff members neglected regional characteristics and ethnic characteristics, and their leadership in production did not proceed from the local situation, simply copying the methods used in agricultural areas. At that time, leading farmers to organize mutual aid teams mostly focused on mutual aid in agriculture, ignoring animal husbandry production. Although mutual aid teams improved agricultural production, the livestock of each household was not well fed and managed. In some places, the sheep were so thin they were about to die, and the cattle were so thin they had to be carried. Some people had to take care of their own livestock, so they withdrew from the mutual aid teams.

Some mutual aid teams, according to the requirements of their members, also began to provide mutual aid in animal husbandry. The method of mutual aid was: to combine all the livestock of the group, assign people from the group to graze them, and members would exchange labor or compensate with wages.

Some agricultural production cooperatives, in order to solve the problem of members being too busy with both agricultural and pastoral production, had the cooperative assign full-time personnel to graze the members' livestock on their behalf, with the livestock owners paying grazing fees to the cooperative.

Whether livestock is grazed collectively by mutual aid teams or uniformly by cooperatives, it is much better than individual households grazing them separately. For example, in the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative of Gongnong Village, Zhalute Banner, when each household grazed separately, due to lack of manpower and shed facilities, they could not go to distant places to select good pastures and implement transhumant grazing. Large and small livestock would revolve around the village all year round, not getting good grass and also damaging crops. Of the 60 cattle, one-third would be so thin in winter that they had to be carried. The sheep would mate randomly, and although many lambs were born, many also died. Carts full of dead lambs would be hauled back. After the cooperative took over the unified grazing, it was able to implement transhumant grazing during the green grass season, and even the emaciated cattle became fat. Because regular mating was implemented, the sheep could lamb on time; in the past, 100 ewes would not produce 50 lambs in a year; after unified grazing, they could produce 70 to 80.

However, because the livestock is still completely privately owned when mutual aid teams graze collectively or cooperatives graze uniformly, there are still many limitations in developing production. For example, there can be no planned selection of breeding sires to improve breeds; no increase in shed facilities; it is not convenient to collectively store grass and fodder; in grazing, it is generally only possible to achieve transhumant grazing in the summer and autumn seasons. Therefore, with the progress of agricultural cooperativization, all localities, according to the needs of animal husbandry production development and the demands of farmers, have further adopted the method of livestock being contributed to the cooperative as shares, with labor and livestock shares being distributed in appropriate proportions, and the cooperative uniformly managing animal husbandry, transforming agricultural production cooperatives into agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives. In this way, the cooperative can regard animal husbandry as an important management project, combine animal husbandry and agriculture, support each other, and develop together.

The agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives of Inner Mongolia were developed step by step under the leadership of the Communist Party, according to production needs and the masses' awareness. Now many farmers have realized that it is a good organizational form for developing agricultural and pastoral production and guiding agriculture and animal husbandry to socialism.

Farmers believe that agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives have the following advantages:

After the cooperative unifies the management of agriculture and animal husbandry, it can resolve the contradictions between household affairs and cooperative affairs, the contradictions between agriculture and animal husbandry, and eliminate the estrangement between Mongolians and Hans.

In the past, when each household raised livestock themselves, many people suffered from being too busy with both participating in cooperative labor and raising their own livestock. After the cooperative unified management, the members were no longer burdened by both.

The result of the ruling class seizing land, forcing reclamation, and blindly developing agricultural and pastoral production on the basis of individual private economy in the old society is that in many places, farmland and pastures are intertwined. In this way, either farmland hinders pastures, or grazing livestock damages crops. In many places, Mongolian and Han people live together in mixed communities, and conflicts between farming and grazing often cause estrangement and disunity between ethnic groups. After the cooperative unified the management of agriculture and animal husbandry, it was possible to adjust farmland and pastures in a planned way, so that cultivated land was connected and pastures were expanded, and it was also possible to reclaim wasteland in a planned way. In this way, the agricultural and pastoral contradictions have been transformed into agricultural and pastoral mutual aid. Agricultural by-products such as straw and chaff can be used as livestock feed. The cooperative can also plant pasture and establish feed bases. The development of agriculture can provide a reliable material guarantee for livestock breeding and reproduction. Animal husbandry can provide agriculture with sufficient fertilizer and animal power. For example, the Pioneer Agricultural and Pastoral Production Cooperative in the Second District of Urad Front Banner has more than 4,000 livestock, which can accumulate 20,000 cartloads of fertilizer a year, which can increase agricultural production by 200,000 catties of grain.

The combination of agriculture and animal husbandry has also brought new ethnic relations to the Mongolian and Han people. Due to economic mutual assistance, the political unity between the Mongolian and Han people has been further strengthened.

More importantly, after collective management of animal husbandry, it is possible to increase equipment, improve technology, carry out various production reforms, and greatly increase production.

In terms of grazing, it is possible to achieve transhumant grazing in all four seasons, and to graze in small groups according to livestock type. For example, the Xinmu Cooperative in Zhalute Banner has divided grazing grounds for all four seasons. Wells have been drilled and temporary housing has been built in each pasture. Livestock can graze in various places in rotation throughout the four seasons, where they can eat good grass and drink good water, and people also have houses to live in. They have organized a technical research group in animal husbandry, which regularly studies and improves grazing techniques. Before the establishment of the cooperative, their livestock generally only reached 60% to 70% of their best condition in the autumn; after the establishment of the cooperative, they could reach 80% to 90% of their best condition. The surrounding farmers praised their livestock: "They have the same condition in winter as in summer!" In the past, livestock that were weak in the spring accounted for 20% to 30%, now it is only 6% to 7%. In the past, 100 sheep could only produce 60 lambs, now they can produce more than 90.

Many agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives have organized women to form milking teams. The milking team of the Xinmu Cooperative has continuously improved its technology and launched competitions, and the milk yield has increased by 50% compared to the past. Last year was the first year of collective management of animal husbandry in the Guangming Cooperative of Zhalute Banner. Each dairy cow produced 15 catties of butter and 40 catties of milk curd, which could be exchanged for more than 600 catties of grain or half a dairy cow at the local market price.

Cooperatives can use new-style animal husbandry tools. The Xinmu Cooperative used horse-drawn mowers to cut grass last year, and each livestock had an average of 500 catties of hay. Local general herders use sickles to cut grass, and each livestock has an average of only about 200 catties of hay.

Some agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives have begun to use fine breeds of dairy cows and fine-wool sheep to improve breeds. Many members of agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives are talking about: in the future, not only will tractors be used to cultivate land, but also machines will be used to milk and feed livestock. At that time, a fine breed dairy cow can produce dozens of catties of milk a day, and a sheep can shear more than ten catties of wool a year, which can both support the country's industrial construction and improve personal lives.

    农牧业生产合作社的优越性
    本报记者  林沫
    在内蒙古自治区的半农半牧区，荒地很多，到处有草场、牧场，一般蒙、汉族农民既耕种土地，又养着不少牲畜。特别是蒙族农民，历来就善于经营畜牧业。
    在这些地区发展生产，应该充分利用自然条件，把农业和牧业很好地结合起来。过去有些工作人员，忽视地区特点和民族特点，领导生产不从当地情况出发，简单地搬用农业地区的一套办法。那时候领导农民组织互助组，大都只在农业上互助，对牧业生产丢开不管。互助组虽然把农业生产提高了，但是各家的牲畜饲养管理不好，有些地方，羊瘦的要死，牛瘦的要抬。有的人要照顾自己的牲畜，就退出了互助组。
    有些互助组根据组员的要求，也在牧业上互助起来了。互助的办法是：把全组的牲畜合群，由组内抽人放牧，组员之间互相换工或找补工资。
    有些农业生产合作社，为解决社员农业牧业生产两头忙不过来的问题，由社里抽专人代放社员的牲畜，畜主向社里出放牧费。
    牲畜由互助组合群放或合作社统一代放，都比过去一家一户单独放好多了。如扎鲁特旗工农村胜利农业生产合作社，各家单独放牧的时候，因为缺乏人力和棚圈设备，就不能到远处选择好牧场，实行移场放牧。大小牲畜一年四季围村转，吃不上好草，还要糟蹋庄稼。60头牛，到冬天瘦的有三分之一要人抬。羊是乱交配，下羔虽多，死的也多。死的羊羔一车一车往回拉。合作社统一代放之后，青草季节能够移场放牧，瘦成三棱的牛也吃肥了。因为实行定期交配，羊能按时下羔；过去100只母羊，一年成不了50个羔；统一代放之后就能成70到80个。
    可是，互助组合群放牧或合作社统一代放，因为牲畜仍然完全归私人所有，所以在发展生产上仍然受很多限制。如：不能有计划地选留种公畜，改良品种；不能增加棚圈设备；不便于集体储备草料；在放牧上，一般只能作到夏秋两季移场放牧。因此，随着农业合作化的进展，各地根据牧业生产发展的需要和农民的要求，进一步采取牲畜向合作社入股，劳动和畜股按适当比例分益的办法，由合作社统一经营畜牧业，把农业生产合作社改变成农牧业生产合作社。这样，合作社就可以把牧业作为一个重要的经营项目，把牧业和农业结合起来，互相支援，共同发展。
    内蒙古的农牧业生产合作社，就是这样在共产党的领导下，根据生产需要和群众觉悟，逐步发展起来的。现在许多农民已经认识到，它是发展农业牧业生产和引导农业牧业过渡到社会主义的良好组织形式。
    农民们认为农牧业生产合作社有这样几方面的好处：
    合作社统一经营农业牧业之后，可以解决家务和社务的矛盾、农业和牧业的矛盾，消除蒙族汉族之间的隔阂。
    过去，各家自己饲养牲畜的时候，很多人苦于参加社里劳动和饲养家有牲畜两头忙不过来。合作社统一经营以后，社员就不再两头牵挂了。
    旧社会统治阶级侵占土地、强迫开垦，以及个体私有经济基础上盲目发展农业牧业生产的结果，在很多地方农田、牧场插花交错。这样，不是农田妨碍了牧场，就是放牧牲畜蹧践了庄稼。在很多地方是蒙汉人民一地杂居，往往由种地和放牧的矛盾，引起民族之间的隔阂和不团结。合作社统一经营农业牧业之后，就可以有计划地调整农田、牧场，使耕地连片，牧场扩大，还可以有计划地开垦荒地。这样，就把农牧矛盾变成了农牧互助。农业上的副产品稭草和秕粮可作为牲畜饲料。合作社还可以种植牧草，建立饲料基地。农业的发展能使牲畜的饲养、繁殖得到可靠的物质保证。畜牧业可以供给农业充足的肥料和畜力。如乌拉特前旗二区先锋农牧业生产合作社，全社4，000多头牲畜，一年能积蓄2万车肥料，能使农业增产20万斤粮食。
    农牧结合也给蒙汉人民带来了新的民族关系。蒙汉人民由于经济上的互助，进一步加强了政治上的团结。
    更重要的是，牧业集体经营之后，可以增加设备，提高技术，进行各种生产改革，大大提高生产。
    在放牧方面，可以作到四季移场放牧，可以按牲畜类别分小群放。如扎鲁特旗新牧社，划分有四季牧场。每处牧场都打了水井，盖了临时住房。牲畜四季轮流到各处放牧，都可以吃到好草，喝到好水，人也有房子住。他们在牧业上组织有技术研究小组，经常研究改进放牧技术。建社前，他们的牲畜到秋季一般只能达到六、七成膘；建社后，能达到八、九成膘。周围农民称赞他们的牲畜：“冬天也和夏天的膘一样！”过去到春季，牲畜瘦弱的占20％到30％，现在不过6％到7％。过去100只羊只能下60来只羔，现在能下90多只。
    很多农牧业生产合作社，都组织妇女成立了挤奶组。新牧社的挤奶组，由于不断改进技术，展开竞赛，奶的产量比过去提高了50％。扎鲁特旗光明社，去年是头一年集体经营牧业，每头乳牛的产品有15斤黄油，40斤奶豆腐，按当地市价可以换到600多斤粮食或半头乳牛。
    合作社可以使用新式牧业工具。新牧社去年使用马拉割草机割草，每头牲畜平均有500斤干草。当地一般牧民使用镰刀割草，每头牲畜平均不过200斤左右干草。
    有些农牧业生产合作社已经开始用良种乳牛、细毛绵羊改良品种。许多农牧业生产合作社的社员在谈论：将来不光使用拖拉机耕地，还要用机器挤奶、喂牲畜。那时，一头良种乳牛一天能挤几十斤奶，一只羊一年能剪十几斤毛，既能支援国家工业建设，又能改善个人生活。
