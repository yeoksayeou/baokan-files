Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I feel very honored to have the opportunity to speak here.

After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, I have a further understanding of the great victories of our great motherland in recent years, and I have clarified the direction of our current efforts. I warmly support it and guarantee to work hard to implement it in my own work post.

I am a former KMT soldier who revolted. When the People's Liberation Army marched into Southwest China in 1949, I responded to the call of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhu and revolted near Chengdu. Since then, my new life began. For more than six years, thanks to the earnest education of the Party, I have had the opportunity to serve the people. The great achievements of New China have made me even more respectful of my Party and my motherland. Following the Communist Party forever is my only belief from now on!

China, which is advancing, is creating new records every day and every hour, and new figures are emerging in all walks of life. The publication of the Five-Year Plan unfolds a beautiful vision before us. Only the Communist Party can invest 700 million taels of gold for the construction of the country! There have been huge numbers in history, but those were the 450 million taels of silver paid by the Qing Dynasty in the Boxer Protocol and the 200 billion US dollars plundered by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Facts have proved that everything is possible only when the regime is in the hands of the people.

Recently, the high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement and the incorporation of private industrial and commercial enterprises into the orbit of state capitalism have peacefully transformed the individual economy and the capitalist economy, and jointly embarked on the road of socialism. This is a major event unprecedented in world history. The Chinese people are mastering their own destiny for the first time because Chairman Mao first grasped the inevitable course of history.

In this situation, it is necessary to strive to make one's own ideology conform to objective reality; it is also necessary to improve the work of the CPPCC to meet the needs of the masses. I think the greatness of the Communist Party lies in the fact that rivers do not refuse fine streams. I see something, and I will mention it.

Building a socialist motherland is the glorious task of the Chinese people. All human and material resources should be included in this series and used to the best of their ability. However, some people have not been used to their full potential. I am a former KMT soldier who revolted, and also a member of the CPPCC, so I will say a few words in this regard. I come from Hubei. Under the leadership of the Party, the Hubei CPPCC organization established a social group within the conference. One of the working objects of the social group is former KMT soldiers who revolted. According to my understanding, some former KMT soldiers in Wuhan, after several years of study and transformation and training in their work, can generally work hard, and their lives are relatively stable. Some have also shown a certain degree of initiative in various major movements. However, most of them also have patriotic enthusiasm and hope to be used appropriately to maximize their talents and play a role in striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. This is because they deeply feel that everyone's past sins are great. Without the leniency of the people, there is no reason for them to exist. Therefore, they ask to perform meritorious service in the struggle to liberate Taiwan to repay the Communist Party and the people.

In addition, I would like to express my personal opinions on the issue of liberating Taiwan:

(1) The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and no interference from US imperialism is allowed:

US imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan and supported Chiang Kai-shek in being an enemy of the Chinese people. This kind of blatant interference in China's internal affairs is seriously threatening peace in Asia. Therefore, we Chinese people have a sacred responsibility for the liberation of Taiwan. Any treaty signed by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits is considered illegal by our people. This behavior of the US emperor is interfering in China's internal affairs, and we Chinese people will never allow it. If the US emperor does not know what is good for it and wants to continue to occupy Taiwan, then we Chinese people also have the power to simply drive the US emperor out of our territory of Taiwan!

(2) We must support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions:

I deeply feel that the liberation of Taiwan is a sacred historical task of the Chinese people. This task cannot be accomplished by simply shouting a few slogans, but is an arduous and complex struggle task. To complete such an arduous and complex task, there are naturally many necessary preparations:

1. We must raise our vigilance and strengthen anti-espionage work.
2. We must practice thrift and accumulate funds to support socialist construction and the liberation of Taiwan.
3. We must regard the liberation of Taiwan as our own business.

The struggle to build socialism and liberate Taiwan is an inseparable glorious revolutionary cause. Only by striving for socialist construction can we have the conditions to liberate Taiwan, and only by liberating Taiwan can we complete the unification of the motherland and socialist construction. Therefore, we must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and advance under the glorious banner of the great leader Mao Zedong. Our struggle to liberate Taiwan will surely be victorious, and our great cause of building socialism will surely be successful.

    陈克非的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我能有机会在这里发言，感到非常荣幸。
    听了周恩来主席的政治报告，使我更进一步地认识到我们伟大的祖国几年来的伟大胜利，明确了目前我们努力的方向，我是热烈拥护，并保证在自己的工作岗位上努力贯彻。
    我是一个起义军人，当1949年解放大军进军大西南时，响应了毛主席和朱副主席的号召，在成都附近起义的，从此开始了我的新生。6年多的时间，由于党的殷切教育，使我有机会为人民服务；新中国的伟大成就，更使我敬爱自己的党和自己的祖国。永远跟着共产党走，已是我今后的唯一信念！
    前进的中国，每日每时都在创造新的纪录，各行各业都在涌现新的人物。五年计划的公布，在我们面前展开了美丽的远景，只有共产党才能投资7万万两黄金为国家谋建设！历史上也曾有过巨大的数字，那是满清辛丑对外赔款的45，000万两和蒋贼搜括的两百亿美元。事实证明，只有政权掌握在人民手中，一切才有可能。
    最近农业合作化运动的高潮和私营工商业全行业地纳入国家资本主义的轨道，使个体经济和资本主义经济和平地得到改造，共同走社会主义的路，这是世界历史所没有的大事。中国人民第一次掌握自己的命运，由于毛主席先掌握了历史的必然进程。
    在这种情势之下，努力使自己的思想意识符合于客观实际是必要的；政协工作如何做得更好，以适应群众所需要，也是必要的。我觉得共产党之所以伟大，正由于江河不择细流，我见到一点，我就提一点。
    建设社会主义的祖国，是中国人民的光荣任务。一切人力物力都应纳入这一序列，竭力以赴，但部分的人，未尽其用。我是起义军人，又为政协成员，就在这种关系上谈几句。我来自湖北，湖北政协组织在党的领导下，在会内成立了社会组。社会组工作对象之一即起义军人。根据了解，在武汉方面的部分起义军人，经过几年的学习改造及在工作中的锻炼，一般均能努力工作，生活也相当安定，有些在各大运动中也曾表现了一定的积极性。但是，他们中间也多存有爱国主义热情，希望能酌情运用，以达到人尽其材，发挥其对争取和平解放台湾的作用。这由于他们深深感到每个人过去的罪恶是很大的，不是人民的宽大，是没有理由能存在的，因此，他们要求在解放台湾斗争中立功赎罪，以报答共产党和人民。
    此外，我个人对解放台湾问题发表一点意见：
    （一）解放台湾是中国人民的内政问题，不容许美帝国主义来干涉：
    美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾，支持蒋介石与中国人民为敌，这种横加干涉中国内政，是严重地威胁着亚洲的和平。因此，我们中国人民对台湾的解放，是有其神圣的责任。而美国与蒋贼所订的任何条约，我国人民都认为是非法的，美帝这种行为是干涉了中国的内政，我们中国人民是坚决不允许的。如果美帝还不识相，想继续占领台湾，那我们中国人民也有力量干脆地把美帝从我们的领土台湾赶出去！
    （二）要以实际行动支援解放台湾：
    我深深地感到，解放台湾是中国人民神圣的历史任务，这个任务不是空喊几个口号所能完成的，而是艰巨复杂的斗争任务。要完成这样一个艰巨而复杂的任务，自然是有许多必要的准备：
    1．必须提高警惕，加强防奸工作。
    2．必须厉行节约，积累资金，支援社会主义建设，支援解放台湾。
    3．必须将解放台湾当为自己的事。
    建设社会主义和解放台湾斗争是一个分不开的光荣革命事业，唯有努力于社会主义的建设，才能有条件解放台湾，亦唯有将台湾解放了，才能完成祖国的统一和社会主义的建设。因此，要更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，在伟大领袖毛泽东的光辉旗帜下前进，我们解放台湾的斗争才能一定得到胜利，我们建设社会主义的伟大事业才能一定达到成功。
