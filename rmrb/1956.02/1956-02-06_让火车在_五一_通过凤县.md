    To ensure that the train passes through Feng County by "May Day," the track-laying workers along the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway have launched a fervent socialist competition.

    The Qingshiya Station's 552 Mountain is currently a crucial project for ensuring the smooth progress of track laying on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The workers working on the mountain, braving the bitter cold wind, launched challenge competitions between groups and teams. Recently, they have been clearing more than 1,000 cubic meters of earth and stone every day, an increase of 30% in work efficiency compared to before the competition. Wang Han and other excavating workers at the Guanyinshan construction site have improved the method of digging frozen earth, and can now dig more than 1,600 cubic meters of frozen earth every day, with a work efficiency increase of more than 50% compared to before. Workers building the south entrance of the Qinling Grand Tunnel have recently adopted measures such as the "warm grout method" in the grouting project, increasing the grouting efficiency from 5 meters per day to 24 meters.

    让火车在“五一”通过凤县
    宝成铁路北段沿线筑路工人，为了保证在“五一”让火车通过凤县，掀起了热烈的社会主义竞赛。
    青石崖站场552山头是宝成铁路北段目前保证铺轨顺利进展的关键工程。在山头上工作的工人们冒着凛冽的寒风，展开了组和组、队和队之间的挑战竞赛。最近他们每天清除土石1，000多方，比竞赛前工作效率提高了30％。观音山工地的挖土工人王汉等，改进了挖冻土的方法，每天能挖1，600多方冻土，工作效率比以前提高了50％以上。修筑秦岭大隧道南洞口的工人最近在灌浆工程中采用了“暖浆法”等措施，灌浆效率由每天5公尺提高到24公尺。（据新华社讯）
