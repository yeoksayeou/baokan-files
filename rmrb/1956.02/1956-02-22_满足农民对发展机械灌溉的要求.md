Meeting Farmers' Requirements for Developing Mechanical Irrigation
    Yan Mingxiang
    In Shanxi Province, which has realized the semi-socialist agricultural cooperation, agricultural cooperatives universally request the expansion of the area under mechanical irrigation. The Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau planned in September 1955 to promote 650 irrigation machines in 1956, a plan that was quickly exceeded by the number of orders submitted by various regions. By the end of November 1955, agricultural cooperatives across the province requested the installation of 1,400 mechanical waterwheels and planned to construct 112 mechanical irrigation projects. Jieyu County alone requested 800 mechanical waterwheels. In addition, the cooperatives themselves purchased 40 diesel engines.
    Why do agricultural cooperatives favor irrigation machinery so much? First, farmers have recognized that expanding irrigated land is one of the important keys to overcoming natural disasters and ensuring stable and increased agricultural production. After installing two mechanical waterwheels in Anshang, Xinhua Township, Jieyu County, in addition to irrigating the original 490 mu of land, 430 mu of dry land were converted into irrigated land. In 1955, under the conditions of a drought unseen in 30 years, 640 mu of irrigated cotton fields achieved large-scale bumper harvests, yielding 236 jin more of seed cotton per mu compared to the adjacent dry land. Second, the use of mechanical waterwheels is more efficient and lower in cost than the use of animal-powered waterwheels.
    In order to meet farmers' demands for mechanical irrigation, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has revised its 1956 plan for promoting 650 irrigation machines to 1,612 (including 680 diesel engines and 932 boiler-towing machines), totaling 9,760 horsepower. After these machines are installed, they can increase irrigated land by 453,500 mu.
    In order to help agricultural cooperatives solve problems in the installation and use of machinery, the Water Conservancy Bureau convened a forum with technicians from agricultural cooperatives that had already installed water conservancy machinery to exchange experiences in operation, maintenance, and repair, and to study the renovation of old wells to solve the problem of insufficient water sources. The Water Conservancy Bureau also held water conservancy machinery training courses to train technicians for agricultural cooperatives to operate the machinery. From December 1, 1955, to the end of February 1956, 700 technicians will be trained to operate waterwheels, diesel engines, and boiler-towing machines. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives that have already installed machinery are organized to train a group of technicians for newly installed machinery by means of apprenticeship. In order to solve the problems of machinery repair and parts and fuel supply, the Water Conservancy Bureau has consulted with the supply and marketing cooperatives to have key grassroots cooperatives handle the sales of parts and fuel for mechanical waterwheels, diesel engines, and boiler-towing machines to meet the needs of agricultural cooperatives for machinery parts and fuel.

    满足农民对发展机械灌溉的要求
    阎明祥
    在实现了半社会主义的农业合作化的山西省，农业合作社普遍要求扩大机械灌溉面积。山西省水利局在1955年9月间计划在1956年推广灌溉机械650台，这个计划很快就被各地提出的订购数字突破了。到1955年11月底，全省农业合作社要求安装机械水车1，400台，计划建设机械灌溉工程112处。仅仅解虞一个县就要求订购800台机械水车。此外，合作社自己还买回柴油机40部。
    为什么农业合作社这样喜爱灌溉机械呢？首先是因为农民认识了扩大水浇地是战胜自然灾害、保证农业稳收增产的重要关键之一。解虞县新华乡安上两部机械水车后，除灌溉原有土地490亩外，430亩旱地变为水浇地。在1955年发生30年未见的干旱的情况下，有640亩灌溉棉田获得了大面积丰产，同邻近旱地相比，每亩增产籽棉236斤多。其次是因为使用机械水车，比使用畜力水车效率大，成本低。
    山西省水利局为了满足农民对机械灌溉的要求，已经把1956年推广灌溉机械650台的计划增订为1，612台（其中柴油机680台，锅驼机932台），共有9，760马力。这些机械安装以后，可以增加水浇地453，500亩。
    为了帮助农业合作社解决机械安装和使用中的问题，水利局召集了有已经安装水利机械的农业合作社技工参加的座谈会，交流操作、保管、检修方面的经验，研究改造旧井以解决水源不足的问题。水利局还举办了水利机械训练班，为农业合作社培养操纵机械的技工。自1955年12月1日起到1956年2月底止，将训练操纵水车、柴油机、锅驼机的技工700名。同时，又组织已经安装机械的农业合作社用带徒弟的办法为新安装机械训练一部分技工。为了解决机械修配、零件和燃料的供应问题，水利局已经同供销合作社协商，由基层重点社担任机械水车、柴油机、锅驼机零件和燃料的经销工作，满足农业合作社对机械零件和燃料的需要。
