Heilongjiang Province held a radio rally on February 16th to fully launch socialist emulation and strive to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. More than 1 million people across the province listened to the broadcast.

After the radio rally began, leading comrades such as Han Guang, Second Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Heilongjiang Province, delivered speeches, calling on workers, peasants, handicraftsmen, and scientific and cultural workers throughout the province to engage in creative labor and intensive work to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Then, Zhang Zhigui, a labor model from Harbin City, representing 422 advanced producers from the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, proposed that workers throughout the province launch an advanced producer movement. Wang Jiguo, a worker from the Ma Yongshun team, a national forestry labor model, representing all the workers in the team, proposed launching a competition among all manual logging teams in the province and the national forestry industry system. The Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Xunke County, far on the banks of the Heilongjiang River, called in a long-distance phone call saying: In order to respond to the Party's call, we have decided to plant more stable and high-yield crops and increase corn planting by 100 hectares. Twenty professors and teaching assistants from the Harbin Institute of Technology called the conference, expressing their desire to advance towards science, improve the quality of teaching, and train more outstanding construction talents for the country.
