    The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways
    Plans to Lay 740 Kilometers of Track This Year
    Based on national requirements, the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has determined this year's track laying task after criticizing conservative thinking.
    This year, a total of 740 kilometers of main lines, station lines, and factory dedicated lines will be laid, approximately double the actual track laying mileage of last year. Among these, 407 kilometers will be laid on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, reaching Yumen in August and Heishan Gorge by the end of the year. The track laying mileage for the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is 79 kilometers, with track laying to reach Dijiatai in the first quarter. Construction of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway will also begin in the fourth quarter of this year. In this way, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Baotou-Lanzhou Railways will complete the track laying tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in the third quarter of this year, and construction of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway will begin earlier than scheduled during the first Five-Year Plan period. Along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Baotou-Lanzhou Railways, 22 factory dedicated lines will also be built this year, leading to the Yumen Oil Mine and other factories and mines. A large part of the Lanzhou Railway Hub project will also be completed this year.
    In order to ensure the completion of this task, the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways convened responsible cadres and engineers from its subordinate units to examine and criticize right-leaning conservative thinking, discussed this year's construction organization documents in detail, and comprehensively planned the selection of construction methods, material supply, labor organization, the allocation of machinery and transportation equipment, and water supply.

    铁道部第一工程局
    今年计划铺轨740公里
    铁道部第一工程局根据国家要求，在批判了保守思想的基础上确定了今年铺轨任务。
    今年正线、站线和厂区专用线共将铺轨740公里，约比去年实际铺轨里程增加一倍。其中兰新路将铺轨407公里，8月到达玉门，年底到达黑山峡。包兰路铺轨里程为79公里，第一季度铺轨到狄家台。兰青铁路也将在今年第四季度开始修建。这样，兰新、包兰铁路便在今年第三季度完成了五年计划规定的铺轨任务，兰青铁路也提早在第一个五年计划期间动工。在兰新、包兰铁路沿线今年还要修建通往玉门油矿等厂矿22条厂区专用线。兰州铁路枢纽很大一部分工程也将在今年内完工。
    铁道部第一工程局为了保证这一任务的完成，召集所属各单位负责干部、工程师检查批判了右倾保守思想，详细讨论了今年施工组织文件，全面规划了施工方法的选择、材料供应、劳动组织、机具和运输工具的调配和供水问题。
