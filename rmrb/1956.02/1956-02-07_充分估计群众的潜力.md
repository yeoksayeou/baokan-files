Fully Estimate the Potential of the Masses
By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun

With the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce, the enthusiasm of workers and engineering technicians in factories and mines to accelerate socialist industrial construction is also unprecedentedly high. Those who were backward in the past have become active, and those who were already active have become even more so; some things that were impossible in the past have been done, and the impossible has become possible. The socialist enthusiasm of the masses of workers is forming a surging, unstoppable force. The leadership work of factories and mines is also undergoing profound changes. Many leaders of factories and mines have examined their right-leaning conservative thinking, actively revised backward plans and quotas, and formulated comprehensive plans to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

However, this does not mean that the situation in which the leadership lags behind the masses no longer exists in all factories and mines, and that right-leaning conservative thinking has been overcome. In the Shenyang area, the new targets set by many factories are generally much higher than last year. However, some leaders still underestimate the enthusiasm of the masses and various favorable conditions, and have not further relied on the masses to tap potential, making the planned targets more realistic, more advanced, and more courageous.

Take the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory as an example. The production plan for 1956 initially proposed by the leadership was to increase production by 60% compared to last year, exceeding the production level originally planned for 1957. This is an encouraging leap forward. However, the leaders were satisfied with this number, believing that it was already "not easy" to complete this task, and that it would be "difficult" to increase it further. They said to the workshop leaders: "What you need to consider now is not the issue of speed, but how to take measures to guarantee it." However, the workshop leaders believed that the targets set by the leadership were still conservative. According to the preliminary calculations of the workshop director and planner, all workshops in the factory, except one, were confident of overfulfilling the factory's set production targets by 30-40 days ahead of schedule. This conclusion is based on sufficient evidence. According to preliminary statistics from the Second Workshop, as long as eight rationalization proposals are promoted this year, efficiency can be increased by 35%, and the promotion of nine advanced cutting experiences can increase efficiency by 20%. These measures can save at least 35,000 work hours throughout the year. In the First Workshop, as soon as the new quotas for this year were issued, 36 of the 45 quotas were exceeded by 15%-50% by the workers. This is an unprecedented new situation, and the leadership must give it full consideration and appropriately revise the original plan based on it. However, the factory leaders do not trust the masses and are full of "worries," repeatedly questioning the "basis" of the workshop's proposal to complete the plan ahead of schedule. Instead of actively seeking this possibility based on the workshop's suggestions, they attempted to overturn the workshop's basis by claiming it was "insufficiently based" and "the method was incorrect." As a result, the factory's planned targets could not be determined for a long time, and it was impossible to mobilize the masses to discuss them.

Like the situation at the No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, it exists to varying degrees in other factories in Shenyang. The Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory originally planned to complete the production task of 50,000 drill bits in one and a half months. The leaders believed that this target was 50% higher than last year, and the masses of workers might not be able to accept it. As a result, the opposite happened. After a discussion, the masses believed that it could be done in just one month. The machining workshop of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory reduced the product man-hours for this year by 30% compared to last year, and the leaders believed it was already very "advanced." However, the workers demanded a further reduction of 50% based on the 30% reduction.

Insufficient estimation of production potential and insufficient trust in the enthusiasm of the masses are also manifested in the fact that some factory leaders believe that mobilizing the masses to discuss plans is just a formality, at most a "guarantee," and therefore attempt to hand over a "sound" plan to the masses for discussion only after "considering everything carefully." Some leaders simply close the door and make plans, believing that mobilizing the masses too quickly will lead to being "passive." However, the masses are not willing to be coldly left aside. Some people actively ask the leaders: The people of the whole country are actively acting to accelerate socialist construction, why are we always standing still?

To overcome this situation in which the leadership lags behind the masses, the only way is to eliminate the leaders' concerns and quickly mobilize the masses. And only by closely connecting with the masses can we dispel worries and move forward quickly.

There is such an example: The design tasks of the Fourth Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building this year are more than doubled compared to last year, and the quality requirements are also very high. The leaders believed that to complete this task, it was necessary to add 37 technical personnel. They took this "plan" to Beijing. At this time, the Party put forward the call to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Seeing that the situation was not right, they did not put forward the original "plan" and "ventured" to take on the task. Before they returned, the design bureau's Party organization mobilized the masses to discuss. After a discussion, the masses not only did not need to add a single person, but also completed 57 design tasks 10-90 days ahead of schedule, while also increasing the workload by 30%-40%, and doing next year's tasks ahead of schedule this year. For a long time, the leaders of this unit have always believed that design is a brain-wracking thing, and mobilizing the masses is useless, so they have never handed the plan over to the masses for discussion. Now the facts show that this "special situation" does not exist. Mobilizing the masses only makes the leadership work more proactive, and makes the leadership consider more carefully and see further. This vivid fact tells us: We should fully trust and estimate the potential of the workers and engineering technicians. As long as we rely on them conscientiously, we can turn some things that are subjectively considered impossible into possible, and turn things that are subjectively considered impossible into things that can be done.

### 充分估计群众的潜力

    充分估计群众的潜力
    本报记者　金雨困
    随着农业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造高潮的到来，厂矿企业中的职工和工程技术人员为加速社会主义工业建设而斗争的积极性也空前地高涨。过去落后的人积极起来了，积极的更加积极了；有些本来办不到的事情办到了，不可能的也可能了。职工群众的社会主义积极性正在形成一股汹涌的、不可阻挡的力量。厂矿的领导工作也在发生深刻的变化。许多厂矿的领导人员检查了右倾保守思想，积极地修改落后的计划和定额，制定提前完成五年计划的全面规划。
    但是，这并不等于说，在所有的厂矿里，领导落后于群众的情况已经不存在了，右倾保守思想都已经克服了。在沈阳地区，许多工厂所订的新指标一般都比去年高了很多。但是，有些领导人员对群众的积极性和种种有利条件仍然估计不足，没有进一步依靠群众挖掘潜力，把计划指标订得更切合实际、更先进、更勇敢些。
    以沈阳第三机床厂来说，领导上初步提出的1956年的产量计划要比去年增加60％，超过了原计划1957年达到的生产水平。这是令人鼓舞的跃进。但是，领导人员满足于这个数字，认为要完成这个任务已经“不轻松”了，再提高是“很难”了。他们对车间的领导人员说：“现在你们要考虑的不是速度问题，而是如何采取措施来保证的问题。”但是车间领导人员认为领导上提出的指标仍然是保守的，仅车间主任和计划员初步计算，就得出了这样的结论：除一个车间外，全厂所有车间都有把握提前30—40天超额完成厂里定的产量指标。这个结论是有充分根据的。根据二车间初步统计，今年只要推广8件合理化建议就可提高效率35％，推广9种先进切削经验，就可提高效率20％。这些措施全年至少可节约35，000工时。在一车间，今年的新定额一颁布，45种定额就有36种被职工超过了15％—50％。这是前所未有的新情况，领导人员必须给以充分的估计，并根据它来适当修正原来的计划。但是，工厂的领导人员不相信群众，“忧虑”重重，一再怀疑车间提出可以提前完成计划的“根据”。他们不是积极地根据车间的建议来寻找这种可能，而是企图用“根据不足”、“方法不对”来推翻车间的根据。结果工厂的计划指标迟迟不能确定，也没法发动群众讨论。
    像机床三厂的情况，在沈阳其它工厂里也或多或少地存在着。沈阳矿山机器厂原来计划在一个半月内完成5万钎头的生产任务，领导人员认为这个指标比去年提高了50％，职工群众可能接受不了。结果恰恰相反，群众一讨论，认为只要一个月就行了。沈阳风动工具厂机装车间把今年的产品工时比去年压缩了30％，领导人员认为已经很“先进”。但是，工人要求在压缩30％的基础上再压缩50％。
    对生产的潜力估计不足，对群众的积极性不够信任，还表现在有些厂的领导人员认为发动群众讨论计划只是走走形式，顶多是“保证保证”而已，因而企图把什么都“考虑周到”后才把“四平八稳”的计划交给群众讨论。有的领导人员干脆关门搞规划，认为群众发动得太快，就会陷于“被动”。但是，群众并不甘心被冷冷地搁在一旁。有的人主动去问领导：全国人民都为加速社会主义建设而积极行动起来了，为什么我们老是按兵不动？
    要克服这种领导落后于群众的状况，唯一的办法是破除领导人员的顾虑，迅速发动群众。而只有跟群众密切联系，才能解除忧虑，迅速前进。
    有这样一个例子：第一机械工业部设计四分局今年的设计任务比去年增加一倍以上，质量要求也很高。领导人员认为，要完成这个任务，需要增加37个技术人员。他们带着这个“打算”到了北京。正在这个时候，党提出了提前完成五年计划的号召，他们看见形势不对头，没有提出原来的“打算”，就“冒险”地把任务接了下来。他们还没有回来，设计局的党组织就发动群众讨论。群众一讨论，不但不需要增加一个人，而且还把57项设计任务提前10—90天完成，同时还增加了30％—40％的工作量，把明年的任务提前到今年来干。长时期以来，这个单位的领导人员一直认为设计是伤脑筋的事情，发动群众也不顶事，所以从未把计划交给群众讨论过。现在事实说明这种“特殊情况”并不存在，群众发动了，只有使领导工作更加主动，使领导考虑得更周到，看得更远。这个生动的事实告诉我们：应该充分信任和估计职工群众和工程技术人员的潜力，只要认真地依靠他们，就可以把有些主观上认为不可能的事情变为可能，把主观认为不能办到的事情变为能办得到的。
