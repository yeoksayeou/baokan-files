Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong - The performances of the Chinese Folk Art Troupe in Macao have been warmly welcomed by Macao audiences.

By the 16th, the Chinese Folk Art Troupe had already performed 8 shows in Macao, with an audience of over 10,000 people. Many compatriots living in Hong Kong also came to Macao to watch the art troupe's performances. Many people queued up to buy tickets as early as 4 o'clock in the morning. The Chinese folk dance programs performed by the art troupe, such as the Picking Tea and Catching Butterflies Dance, the Lotus Dance, the Red Silk Dance, and the Lion Dance, were repeatedly re-performed at the request of the audience with applause.

He Xian, Chairman of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said after watching the performance that the actors' happy faces and joyful songs showed that compatriots in every corner of the country are living a beautiful and happy life today. The actors from all over the country, from the east, west, north, and south, are united in one furnace, demonstrating that compatriots from all over the country are unprecedentedly united and loving today. Macao folk artist Tà Yanwen said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people have been completely liberated from all kinds of constraints, and their lives are different from before. Only in this way can the folk art of the motherland truly gain its head.
