    Overcoming Laxity After Public-Private Partnership
    Kong Sang
    Some capitalists, after celebrating the approval of their enterprises for public-private partnership, have developed a lax attitude of passively waiting for the enterprise to be reformed and reorganized, which has affected the enterprise's production and operation. For example, a blacksmith shop in the Xidan district of Beijing used to regularly undertake orders from the Beijing Medical Instrument Factory before the public-private partnership. After the partnership, the capitalist of this blacksmith shop used the excuse of "waiting for the company to assign tasks" to refuse orders, causing the factory to be in a state of semi-shutdown. After a factory in Chongwen district that produced enamel materials was approved for public-private partnership, the product quality declined and the cost increased, but the capitalist did not care, and would say to the workers, "You handle it!" whenever something came up. A capitalist of a knife and scissor shop used to personally go to the market to buy goods, but after the partnership, he stopped going. Another capitalist of a knife and scissor shop said, "After the partnership, I don't care about purchasing. If there is a big matter in the shop, you can find the public representative, and if there is a small matter, you can find the workers. I should rest for a couple of days."
    The above-mentioned capitalists' passive waiting for the government to reform and reorganize the enterprise, or the practice of "wanting to rest" is wrong. We know that after an enterprise is approved for public-private partnership, it is still necessary to carry out a series of tasks such as asset verification, production arrangement, personnel arrangement, economic reorganization, and enterprise transformation. These tasks, unlike the application and approval of public-private partnership, cannot be completed in a short period of time using mass movements. Instead, they require careful work to be done with leadership and planning, and it takes a certain amount of time. Therefore, after an enterprise is approved for public-private partnership, but before further reorganization and transformation, the original enterprise owners should continue to be responsible, actively do a good job in production, operation, and financial work, and ensure the normal production or business operation of the enterprise, so as to avoid losses to the market supply work. If the enterprise is ruined while passively waiting and "resting," what can be reorganized and transformed? If a capitalist becomes passive or lax after the enterprise is approved for public-private partnership, how can he better accept reform and become a socialist labor citizen?

    克服公私合营后的松懈情绪
    孔桑
    有些资本家，在庆祝企业被批准公私合营以后，产生了坐等企业改造和改组的松懈情绪，企业的生产经营因而受到影响。例如北京西单区有家铁工厂，在公私合营以前经常承做北京医疗器械厂的订货，合营以后，这家铁工厂的资本家却用“等公司布置任务”的借口来拒绝订货了，致使工厂处于半停工状态。崇文区有一家做珐琅料的工厂被批准公私合营以后，产品质量下降，成本增高，资本家却不管，遇到事情就对工人说：“你们看着办吧！”有一个刀剪铺的资本家，以前经常亲自上市买货，合营以后他就不去了。另一个刀剪铺的资本家说：“合营后，我不管进货了，柜上有大事可以找公股代表，有小事可以找工人，我该歇两天了。”
    上述的这些资本家消极等待政府来改造和改组企业，或者“想歇一歇”的作法是不对的。我们知道，在企业被批准公私合营以后，还必须进行清产核资、生产安排和人事安排、经济改组、企业改造等等一系列的工作。这些工作，都不像申请和批准公私合营那样，可以在短期内用群众运动的方式来完成，而是要有领导有计划地进行细致的工作才能做好，并且需要有一定的时间。因此，在企业被批准公私合营后，尚未进一步改组、改造前，原来的企业主应该继续负责，积极搞好生产经营和财务工作，保证企业生产或营业的正常进行，以免市场供应工作受到损失。如果企业在消极等待和“歇一歇”当中被搞垮了，还有什么可以改组和改造的呢？如果一个资本家在企业被批准公私合营后就消极等待或者松下劲来，他又怎么能够更好地接受改造，成为社会主义的劳动公民呢？
