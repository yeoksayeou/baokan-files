A batch of auxiliary workshops belonging to the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, as well as the spacious and tall repair and casting workshop, and the general warehouse, have recently been capped and are ready for equipment installation.

Various workshops planned for construction this year are also intensifying preparations for construction, striving to start construction as early as possible and speed up the progress of the project. At present, the construction of the woodworking workshop has started ahead of schedule; the construction of the engine workshop and the stamping workshop will begin soon.

Near the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, a large-scale equipment installation and processing plant is also under construction. This factory will build 28 workshops and warehouses, including forging, riveting, fitting, and turning workshops. Once these workshops are completed and put into production, they will undertake all equipment installation and processing work for the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant.

On the principle of not affecting the service life, the factory buildings of this processing plant will all adopt bamboo structures. This will not only save the country a lot of money but also speed up the construction of the factory.

    第一拖拉机厂一批工场即将安装设备
    第一拖拉机制造厂拥有13个车间的辅助工场、宽敞高大的修铸工场和总仓库的建筑，最近都已经结顶，准备开始安装设备。
    计划在今年施工的各个工场，也正在加紧进行施工前的准备工作，争取尽量提前开工和加快工程进展的速度。目前，木工场的施工已经提前开始；发动机工场和冲压工场的厂房建筑最近就要开工。
    在第一拖拉机制造厂的附近，还正在兴建一所规模巨大的设备安装加工厂。这个工厂将建设锻工、铆工、钳工、车工等28个车间和库房。这些车间建成投入生产以后，就将承担第一拖拉机制造厂全部设备安装的加工工作。
    在不影响服务年限的原则下，这个加工厂的厂房建筑将全部采用竹结构。这不仅能为国家节省大量资金，还可以加快建厂的速度。
