Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd. The Ministry of Railways has decided to start construction this year on several railway trunk lines that were originally outside the scope of the First Five-Year Plan. The more important trunk lines include the Neijiang to Yibin section of the Nei(jiang) Kun(ming) Railway, the Ganshui to Guiyang section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, and the Guiyang to Duyun section of the Qian-Gui Railway. The original Duyun to Jinchengjiang section of the Qian-Gui Railway will also be repaired this year. After these railways are completed, the railways of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces will be connected to other railway trunk lines throughout the country. A new railway will be built this year from Wuhu in Anhui Province to Guixi in Jiangxi Province, connecting to the Ning(Nanjing) Wu(hu) Railway at its northern end and to the Zhe-Gan Railway at Guixi at its southern end. A new railway will also be built from Hunan to Guizhou, with the Xiangtan to Xinhua section of the road starting construction this year. The railway from Lanzhou in Gansu to Xining in Qinghai will also start construction this year.

    今年提前修筑几条五年计划外的铁路
    新华社2日讯　铁道部决定今年提前开工兴建几条原定第一个五年计划之外的铁路干线。这里比较重要的干线，有内（江）昆（明）铁路内江到宜宾段、川黔铁路赶水到贵阳段、黔桂铁路贵阳到都匀段；原有的黔桂铁路都匀到金城江段，今年也要修复。这几条铁路修好以后，云南、四川、贵州、广西各省的铁路就能和全国其他铁路干线连接起来。从安徽省芜湖到江西省的贵溪，要在今年开始修一条新铁路，它的北端和宁（南京）芜（湖）铁路衔接，南端在贵溪和浙赣铁路连接。从湖南到贵州也要修一条新铁路，这条路的湘潭新化段今年先动工。从甘肃兰州到青海西宁间的铁路也在今年开工。另外，云南省碧色寨到中越边境河口之间的铁路，今年也要修复。
