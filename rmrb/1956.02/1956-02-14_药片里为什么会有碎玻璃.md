    Why is there broken glass in the pill?
    To the Editor:
    On January 27th, my wife had tonsillitis, so I went to the No. 1 Branch of the Donghuamen Street Pharmaceutical Company in Beijing to buy a bottle of "Penicillin Throat Lozenges". When she took the lozenge on the morning of the 28th, she felt uncomfortable in her mouth, so she spat out the lozenge she was holding in her mouth and found a piece of broken glass inside.
    If a patient swallows a pill containing broken glass, it is obviously very dangerous. The "State-owned Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory," which manufactures this type of pill, should examine its work.

### 药片里为什么会有碎玻璃

    药片里为什么会有碎玻璃编辑同志：
    1月27日，我的爱人因为扁桃腺发炎，到北京市东华门大街医药公司第一门市部买了一瓶“青霉素喉片”。她在28日早晨吃药片的时候，嘴里感到不舒服，就把嘴里含着的药片吐了出来，结果发现里面有着一块碎玻璃。
    药片里有碎玻璃，如果病人把它咽下去了，显然是很危险的。制造这种药片的“国营武汉制药厂”应该检查自己的工作。
