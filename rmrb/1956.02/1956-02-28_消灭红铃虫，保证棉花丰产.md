Eliminate the Pink Bollworm to Guarantee a Bumper Cotton Harvest
Deputy Director of the Plant Protection Department, East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, Fu Shengfa

The cotton pink bollworm is known as one of the world's six major pests. It is widely distributed in our country. The Yangtze River and South China cotton areas are most severely affected by the pink bollworm, with an average annual cotton yield loss of more than 20%; the Yellow River cotton area and Northeast China cotton area are less affected, but the loss is also about 10%.

The life habits of the pink bollworm are quite complex. In terms of the number of generations per year, some areas have two generations a year, some areas have three to four generations, and some areas have up to seven generations. Overwintering larvae begin to pupate and emerge from May each year; the emergence period can be extended to August. After emergence, the adults fly to the vast cotton fields to mate and lay eggs (a female moth can lay up to 500 eggs), and breed to cause damage. It damages flower buds and flowers during the cotton flowering period, and then turns to harm green bolls in the later stage. Damage to buds and flowers causes them to fall off; damage to green bolls forms stiff petals. When the cotton begins to fluff, due to the temperature starting to drop and the food gradually becoming scarce, it is carried to the warehouse with the harvested seed cotton. During the process of seed cotton acquisition, transportation, and processing, some pink bollworms crawl into the warehouses and workshops of flower collection stations and ginning mills to overwinter; those that do not crawl out hibernate in the cotton seeds. In addition, some hide in the dead bolls on the cotton plants to overwinter. Because the emergence period of overwintering larvae is very long and the number of generations is large, the pest population density continues to increase and a phenomenon of overlapping generations is formed, which creates a certain degree of complexity for prevention and control work.

However, no matter how complex the life habits of the pink bollworm are, it still has weaknesses, that is, its overwintering places are concentrated from vast cotton fields of millions of acres to a very small area. According to the discovered patterns, they are hidden in warehouses for storing seed cotton and cottonseeds, ginning workshops, cleared flower residue, cottonseeds, holes at both ends of sun-drying curtains, and dead bolls on cotton plants. This is a favorable condition for us to carry out control work. As long as we eliminate the overwintering pest population in these overwintering places, we will greatly reduce the damage of the pink bollworm to cotton in the following year.

The following are several methods for controlling overwintering pink bollworms:

1. State-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and all other farmers should use curtain frame sun-drying methods during the sun-drying period, and raise chickens to peck and eat pink bollworms. At night, add coverings (burlap sacks, bed sheets, mats, newspapers, etc.) on the seed cotton, and clear the larvae that crawl onto the coverings the next morning. Paste 3-inch-wide newspapers around the walls and pillars of the place where seed cotton is piled, only pasting the base so that the paper hangs down, pasting three times in a row, with a distance of 1 inch between each, and placing a small amount of 0.5% effective ingredient "666" powder in the second paper trough, which can poison the larvae that climb up. After the flower collection is over, take down and burn these papers.

2. Before storing seed cotton, lint, and cottonseeds, the storage places and ginning workshops of flower collection stations, ginning mills, oil pressing plants, state-owned farms, and agricultural production cooperatives should be completely sprayed with 50% wettable DDT powder mixed with ten times the amount of water, or 25% DDT emulsion mixed with five times the amount of water. Spray 10 jin of liquid medicine per 1,000 square feet. Spray once a month, for three consecutive sprays. Combine with manual sweeping during periods when the number of insects is high. The flower residue cleared from the ginning mill must be thoroughly destroyed at any time.

3. After the sun-drying is over, both ends of the flower curtain made of reeds or thin bamboo should be immersed in boiling water for 10 minutes to eliminate overwintering larvae hiding inside. Collection of flowers and storage utensils should also be treated at the same time.

4. Before pulling out the cotton stalks, the dead bolls on the cotton plants should be removed and destroyed. If they cannot be removed for a while, they should also be removed and destroyed before spring.

5. All cottonseeds used for sowing should be fumigated with methyl bromide before sowing. If there are no conditions, soaking the seeds in 3 parts of boiling water and 1 part of cold water for half an hour before sowing is also acceptable.

6. The cottonseed of the oil pressing plant must be pressed completely before the end of March. Cottonseeds that cannot be pressed completely should be sealed and taken and sealed as they are pressed, so as to prevent the pink bollworm from emerging into moths and harming the cotton.

To completely eliminate the pink bollworm, in addition to implementing overwintering control measures, field control should also be carried out. The main methods of field control are:

1. In areas where the pink bollworm occurs most seriously or in cotton fields that have been severely damaged in previous years, 25% DDT emulsion at a dilution of 300 to 400 times should be immediately used for the first spraying during the peak emergence period of overwintering pink bollworms. Spray 200 jin to 300 jin of liquid medicine per mu each time. Immediately carry out the second spraying during the peak pupation period (i.e., when pupation is above 60%). Then spray the third time after one month, and spray the fourth time after another half month. This can achieve the purpose of basically eliminating the pink bollworm. In areas where the pink bollworm occurs relatively lightly, or where overwintering control is relatively thorough, the first spraying can be started after the green bolls appear, and then sprayed once every half month until before the peak period of cotton fluffing, for a total of about three sprays.

2. In areas where the density of overwintering pink bollworms is high and there are no conditions to use pharmaceutical machinery for control, artificial capture of flower insects should be carried out from mid-July to early August. At the same time, fallen buds, fallen flowers, and fallen bolls in the fields should be collected and destroyed every three to five days.

3. Combine the work of topping and pruning to compost the picked branches and leaves. After mid-September, pick and destroy the useless flower buds on the cotton plants.

It must be pointed out that for such a seriously harmful and complex pest, it is very necessary to take a series of prevention and control measures that combine overwintering and field control under the current circumstances. Since the State-owned Shanghai Farm in Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province, began to implement the policy of comprehensive overwintering and field control in more than 60,000 mu of cotton fields in the winter of 1953, it has achieved good control results. The green boll damage rate in 1954 dropped from 53.6% in 1953 to 28.1%; in 1955, it further dropped to 19.1%. The number of insects per boll also dropped from 1.35 in 1953 to 0.57 in 1954. And in 1955, it further dropped to 0.35. The cotton stiff petal rate was 6% in 1953, 2.25% in 1954, and further decreased to 0.65% in 1955. The green boll damage rate of individual cotton fields near this farm that did not take pest control measures reached as high as 96%, the number of insects per boll was as high as 8.84, and the stiff petal rate was as high as 43.2%.

    消灭红铃虫，保证棉花丰产
    华东农业科学研究所植物保护系副主任　傅胜发
    棉花红铃虫号称世界六大害虫之一。它在我国的分布极广。长江流域和华南棉区受红铃虫的侵害最重，每年棉花产量的损失平均在20％以上；黄河流域棉区和东北棉区受害比较轻，但是损失也在10％左右。
    红铃虫的生活习性相当复杂。从每年发生代数来说，有的地区一年发生二代，有的地区发生三代到四代，也有的地区发生到七代。过冬幼虫每年从5月开始化蛹羽化；羽化时期可以延长到8月。成虫羽化后就飞到广大的棉田里交配产卵（一个雌蛾最多可产卵500粒），繁殖为害。它在棉花开花时期为害花蕾和花，后期就转害青铃。蕾花被害后造成脱落；青铃被害后形成僵瓣。当棉花吐絮后，由于温度开始下降，食料逐渐缺少，它就随着收摘的籽花被带到仓房里。在籽花收购、转运和加工的过程中，有一部分红铃虫爬到收花站和轧花厂的仓库里和车间里过冬；没有爬出来的就潜伏在棉籽里过冬。此外还有一部分躲在棉株上的枯铃里过冬。由于过冬幼虫羽化时期很长，发生代数较多，因之虫口密度不断增加并且形成世代交叠现象，这就给防治工作造成了一定程度的复杂性。
    但是，不论红铃虫的生活习性如何复杂，它还是有弱点的，就是它的越冬处所是从千百万亩的广大棉田集中到很小的范围里面。根据已经发现的规律，它们分别躲藏在贮放籽花和棉籽的仓房里、轧花车间里、清除的花渣里、棉籽里、晒花帘两端的孔洞里以及棉株上的枯铃里。这时，正是我们进行除治的有利条件。我们只要把这些越冬处所的过冬虫口消灭，就会大大减轻红铃虫下一年对棉花的为害。
    除治越冬红铃虫的办法有下面几种：
    1、国营农场、农业生产合作社及其他所有农户在晒花时期要全部采用帘架晒花的方法，并且养鸡啄食红铃虫，夜里在籽花上加覆盖物（麻袋、布单、席子、报纸等），第二天早上把爬到覆盖物上面的幼虫加以清除。在堆放籽花处所的墙壁和支柱四周加糊3寸宽的报纸，只糊基部使纸下垂，连糊3道，每道相距1寸，在第二道纸槽里放置0.5％有效成分的“六六六”粉少许，可以毒杀爬上来的幼虫。在收花结束后，把这些纸取下烧毁。
    2、收花站、轧花厂、榨油厂、国营农场和农业生产合作社的贮放处所和轧花车间在贮放籽棉、皮棉及棉籽前，应全部喷射50％可湿性滴滴涕加水十倍液，或25％滴滴涕乳剂加水五倍液。每1，000平方市尺喷射药液10斤。每月喷射一次，连喷三次。在虫数较多时期配合人工扫除。轧花厂清除的花渣要随时彻底销毁。
    3、在晒花结束后，用芦苇或细竹制成的花帘的两端要用沸水浸烫10分钟，以消灭躲藏在里边的越冬幼虫。收花及贮花用具也要同时加以处理。
    4、在拔掉棉秸前应摘除销毁棉株上的枯铃，如一时不能摘除，在春季以前也要摘除销毁。
    5、供作播种用的棉籽，在播种前要全部用溴化甲烷熏蒸，如无条件，在播种前用3份开水1份冷水浸种半小时也行。
    6、榨油厂的棉籽，要在3月底以前榨完。不能榨完的棉籽，要加以封糊，并且要随榨随取随封，以免红铃虫化蛾后逃逸为害。
    要彻底消灭红铃虫，除开实行越冬防治的办法以外，还应进行田间防治。田间防治的主要办法是：
    1、在红铃虫发生最严重地区或历年为害最重的棉田，在越冬红铃虫羽化盛期，要立即采用25％滴滴涕乳剂三百倍到四百倍液进行第一次喷药。每次每亩喷射药液200斤到300斤。在化蛹盛期（即化蛹60％以上的时期）立即进行第二次喷药。以后隔一月再喷第三次，再隔半月喷第四次。这样即可达到基本消灭红铃虫的目的。在红铃虫发生比较轻微地区，或越冬防治比较彻底地区，可从青铃出现后开始第一次喷药，以后每隔半月喷射一次，直到棉花吐絮盛期前为止，前后共喷三次左右。
    2、在越冬红铃虫密度较大又没有条件采用药械除治办法的地区，应该在7月中旬到8月上旬期间，进行人工捕捉花虫。同时应每隔三、五日把田间的落蕾、落花、落铃集中销毁一次。
    3、结合摘心整枝工作，把摘下的枝叶沤肥。在9月中旬以后摘毁棉株上无用的花蕾。
    必须指出，我们对于这样一种为害严重生活复杂的害虫，在目前的情况下，采取越冬和田间相结合的一系列的防治办法是非常必要的。江苏省大丰县国营上海农场从1953年冬开始在6万多亩棉田贯彻执行越冬和田间综合防治的方针以来，已经收到了良好的除治效果。青铃被害率在1954年即由1953年的53.6％降到28.1％；1955年更降到19.1％。每铃虫数1954年也由1953年的1.35头降到0.57头。而1955年更降到0.35头。棉花僵瓣率在1953年为6％，1954年降到2.25％，1955年更降到0.65％。这个农场附近没有采取除治虫害措施的个别棉田的青铃被害率竟达96％，每铃虫数竟高达8.84头，僵瓣率更高达43.2％。
