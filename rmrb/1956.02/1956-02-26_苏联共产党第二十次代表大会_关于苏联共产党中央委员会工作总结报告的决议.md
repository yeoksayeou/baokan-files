    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, having heard and discussed the summary report of the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union delivered by Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, resolves as follows:

    The Congress fully and completely approves the political line and concrete work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; approves the proposals and conclusions put forward by the Central Committee in its summary report.

    The Congress notes with satisfaction that, thanks to the implementation of Lenin's policies by the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet Government, thanks to the heroic labor of the Soviet people in close cooperation with the socialist countries, great achievements have been made in our country's construction of a communist society and the struggle for world peace.

    The Congress warmly approves the correct and timely measures taken by the Central Committee of the CPSU in the summary period in the fields of industry and agriculture, which have ensured the further strengthening of our motherland's power, the new and powerful upsurge of the socialist economy, and the great improvement of the Soviet people's living standards.

    The Congress emphasizes that the basis of the victorious activities of the Central Committee of the CPSU is: the creative application of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, the strict observance of the Leninist principles of collective leadership and intra-party democracy, and the unwavering implementation of Lenin's instructions on maintaining the inseparable link between our Party and the people. The Party has held high the great banner of the immortal Lenin all these years.

    I

    The Congress believes that the characteristic of international relations in the summary period is that there has been some relaxation in the international situation, and a real prospect of consolidating peace has emerged on the international stage. The Soviet Union, as well as the People's Republic of China and other people's democracies, have taken timely and important diplomatic measures aimed at consolidating peace and security. These measures have received the active support of all peace-loving forces.

    The entire historical process vividly shows that fundamental changes have taken place in the development of international relations, and the socialist position has been strengthened. The main feature of the present era is that socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country and become a world system, and capitalism is no longer able to stop this development of world historical significance.. In the Soviet Union, as well as in the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the Bulgarian People's Republic, the Albanian People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the economy and culture are booming non-stop, the welfare of the working people is constantly improving, the spiritual and political unity of the people is constantly strengthening, and the people are increasingly closely united around the Communist and Workers' Parties and the governments freely elected by the people. Yugoslavia has also made significant achievements in socialist construction. The economies of countries advancing along the road of socialism are developing on a sound basis, under the conditions of increasingly consolidated equal cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance.

    The situation in the capitalist world, whose area has been greatly reduced, is characterized by a further deepening of profound contradictions. The certain increase in production achieved by capitalist countries in the 10 years after the war, relying on economic militarization and the arms race, stepping up foreign economic expansion, renewing fixed assets, and drastically stepping up the exploitation of the working people, has not stabilized the capitalist economy.

    On the contrary, the capitalist economy is becoming more unstable. The general crisis of the capitalist system continues to deepen. The most profound contradiction of capitalism—the contradiction between modern productive forces and capitalist relations of production—is becoming increasingly acute; the contradictions between capitalist countries competing for sales markets and spheres of influence are constantly deepening; social contradictions are constantly growing and deepening. Due to the increasingly severe exploitation of the working class, the continuous rise in prices, the sharp increase in taxes used for military purposes, and the existence of constant unemployment in many capitalist countries, the living standards of the working people are constantly declining, and the struggle of the working class and the broad masses of the people to win and safeguard their immediate rights and interests is intensifying. Capitalism is constantly moving towards new economic and social upheavals.

    In this situation, two basic and opposing trends in the development of international events have clearly formed.

    On the one hand, the imperialist countries, headed by the reactionary groups in the United States, immediately began to implement the "position of strength" policy after the end of the war. This policy reflects the ambitions of the most aggressive elements in these countries to suppress the workers' movement, the democratic movement, and the national liberation movement, to destroy the socialist camp, and to establish their world hegemony. This policy is actually: unlimited expansion of armaments; establishment of US military bases along the borders of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies; piecing together aggressive blocs aimed at the countries of the socialist camp; launching the so-called "Cold War" against the socialist countries; and planning new bloody wars.

    On the other hand, the forces on the world stage striving for lasting peace and the security of all countries are growing stronger; these forces are launching an active struggle against the threat of war and for peaceful coexistence between countries with different economic and social systems. The continuous consolidation of the international socialist camp is of decisive significance in this regard, and this camp is exerting an ever-increasing influence on the development of the world situation.

    The forces of peace have been greatly enhanced as a result of the emergence on the world stage of a number of European and Asian peace-loving countries, which have declared non-participation in military blocs as the principle of their foreign policy. In this way, a vast "peace zone" has been formed, which includes both socialist countries and non-socialist peace-loving countries in Europe and Asia, and this zone has more than half of the world's population.

    The disintegration of the imperialist colonial system is an event of world historical significance in the post-war period. The national liberation struggles waged by the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries have achieved great victories in the past 10 years: more than 1.2 billion people, accounting for half of the world's population, have been liberated from colonial and semi-colonial dependency. The issue of completely eliminating the colonial system has been put on the agenda. A new period in world history foreseen by the great Lenin has arrived, a period in which the people of the East actively participate in deciding the fate of the world and become a new and powerful factor in international relations.

    The Communist Party, standing at the forefront of the struggle to safeguard peace, the interests of the working people, and the national independence of its own country, is the most active and resolute fighter against the threat of war. At the same time, many other social strata also stand on the side against war. It is very important to consolidate peace to form a united front of all forces against war and to spare no effort in the struggle to maintain peace. Overcoming the split in the workers' movement and establishing practical contacts between the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party and other parties that are willing to defend peace, fight against imperialist oppression, protect the national interests of their countries, and protect democracy and independence is of great significance in this regard.

    The Congress supports the peace-loving foreign policy pursued by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government, which has achieved great success in easing international tensions, consolidating peace, and strengthening the position of democratic forces. The well-known five principles of international relations, which have been recognized by many countries and broad social strata—mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, development of international relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence, and economic cooperation—can play a significant role in this regard. Under the current circumstances, these principles are the best form for determining the mutual relations between countries with different social systems, and can serve as the basis for lasting peaceful relations between all countries in the world.

    Life fully confirms that the proposals of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other peaceful countries are correct and timely. The purpose of these proposals is to reduce armaments, prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, ensure collective security in Europe and collective security in Asia. Solving these extremely important problems can lay the foundation for a consolidated and lasting peace and can facilitate the solution of other important outstanding issues, such as the German question.

    If the Soviet Union and the United States, the two largest powers in the world, and the Soviet Union and major powers such as Britain and France, can establish solid and friendly relations, it will be of great significance to the consolidation of world peace.

    The Twentieth Congress believes that the measures taken by the Soviet side to achieve this goal are timely and correct, and expresses its full support for these measures.

    The interests of guaranteeing lasting peace and the security of European countries require further improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Western European countries.

    Like Britain, France, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Greece, Austria, and all European countries, the Soviet Union has a vital interest in preventing a new war in Europe, which was the main battlefield of the First and Second World Wars. The German people also have a vital interest in this matter. Therefore, the common interests in fighting to prevent a new military conflict unite the various countries and peoples of Europe.

    Expanding and strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the countries of the East will play a prominent role in the current international situation. In view of the great significance of resolving this task, the Twentieth Congress approves the good friendly relations recently established with the Republic of India, Burma, Afghanistan, and Egypt.

    The increasingly widespread desire of the Arab peoples to defend and consolidate their national independence is in line with the cause of strengthening peace and democracy.

    The Twentieth Congress notes with satisfaction that the Soviet Union has established friendly and good-neighborly relations with almost all its neighboring countries. There is no doubt that the establishment of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan is in line with the vital interests of these countries, and in line with the interests of the cause of peace and the security of all peoples.

    International trade and the development of cultural ties will play a huge role in expanding the basis for cooperation between countries.

    The Twentieth Congress points out that some fundamental and principled issues related to the development of the modern international situation, such as the peaceful coexistence of two systems, the possibility of preventing war in the present era, and the forms of transition to socialism in different countries, are of particular importance at present.

    Lenin's principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems has always been the general line of Soviet foreign policy in the past and at present.

    Our Party is leading the construction of a communist society in our country, and it firmly opposes launching wars. The Party proceeds from Lenin's unshakable instruction: The establishment of a new social system in this or that country is an internal matter for the people of this or that country. The Congress notes with satisfaction that the principle of peaceful coexistence is gaining increasingly widespread recognition.

    The most important task of the Soviet Union, the socialist countries, and other peace-loving countries, as well as the broadest masses of the people of all countries, is to maintain and consolidate lasting peace and prevent new wars and new aggression. Under modern international conditions, there is a real possibility of preventing the aggressive forces of imperialism from plunging the people of all countries into a new war, which, at the current level of military technology, would bring endless disasters and destruction to the people of all countries. Now, there is not only a capitalist system in the world; there is also a powerful peace-loving socialist camp, which not only has the spiritual means to prevent aggression, but also has the material means to prevent aggression. In addition, there is a large number of other countries with a total population of several hundred million who are actively opposed to war. There is also a powerful worldwide movement for peace. In capitalist countries, the workers' movement has become a huge force.

    Under these circumstances, Lenin's principle is of course still valid: as long as imperialism exists, the economic basis for the outbreak of war remains. That is why we must maintain the highest degree of vigilance. As long as capitalism exists in the world, the reactionary forces representing the interests of capitalist monopoly organizations will continue to try to carry out military adventures and aggression, and may attempt to launch wars. However, the predetermined inevitability of war does not exist. Now there is such a powerful social and political force that has important means to prevent imperialism from launching wars, and if the imperialists attempt to launch wars, this force will give the aggressors a devastating counterattack and smash their adventure plans. To this end, all forces against war should maintain vigilance and be mobilized, they should act in unity, and should not relax the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace.

    Due to the profound changes in the international situation in favor of socialism, new prospects have emerged for the cause of countries transitioning from capitalism to socialism.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union proceeds from Lenin's principle: "All nations will arrive at socialism—this is inevitable, but not all will do so exactly in the same way; each will contribute something of its own to some form of democracy, to some variety of the dictatorship of the proletariat, to the varying rate of socialist transformations in the different aspects of social life." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 23, p. 58)

    The historical experience of the development of countries along the road of socialism fully confirms Lenin's principle. At present, in addition to the Soviet form of transforming society according to socialist principles, there is also the form of people's democracy. The form of people's democracy has been tested in all aspects for ten years and has been proven to be completely correct. In the people's democratic countries, there are also many different styles and differences depending on the conditions of each country. The form of socialist construction in the People's Republic of China has many characteristics. Its economy was very backward before the victory of the revolution and had a semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature. After the people's democratic countries gained a decisive controlling position, they adopted a policy of peacefully transforming private industry and commerce and gradually turning private industry and commerce into a component of the socialist economy.

    In the future, the forms of transition to socialism in various countries will become more and more diverse, which is completely in line with the law. Moreover, the realization of various forms of transition to socialism is not necessarily linked to civil war under any conditions. Leninism teaches that the ruling class will not voluntarily give up power. However, the degree of acuteness of the class struggle for the transition to socialism, or whether violence is used in the transition, depends less on the proletariat than on the degree of resistance of the exploiters to the will of the vast majority of the working people, and on whether the exploiting classes themselves use violence.

    There is no doubt that in some capitalist countries where capitalism is still strong and possesses a huge military police apparatus, a sharp escalation of the class struggle is inevitable.

    At the same time, due to the fundamental changes in the international arena in favor of socialism, and due to the great increase in the appeal of socialism among workers, peasants, and working intellectuals, the victory of socialism has more favorable conditions. In some capitalist countries, the working class, under the leadership of its vanguard, has a realistic possibility under the current conditions to unite the vast majority of the people under its leadership and ensure that the basic means of production are transferred into the hands of the people. The right-wing bourgeois parties and the governments they form are increasingly facing bankruptcy. Under these conditions, it is possible for the working class to unite the working peasants, the broad intellectuals, and all patriotic forces around itself, to give a resolute blow to the opportunists who cannot give up the policy of compromise with the capitalists and landlords, to defeat the reactionary, anti-people forces, to win a consolidated majority in the parliament, and to transform it from a bourgeois democratic organ into an instrument for expressing the true will of the people.

    The Congress emphasizes that the victory of socialism in other countries can have more favorable conditions only because socialism has already achieved victory in the Soviet Union and is achieving victory in the people's democratic countries. The victory of revolutionary Marxism-Leninism and the unwavering and steadfast struggle against reformism and opportunist ideas have been necessary conditions for achieving the above victories.

    In terms of foreign policy, the Congress proposes the following tasks to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:

    Unswervingly implement Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Actively strive for the cause of peace and the security of all peoples, for the establishment of trust between nations, and strive to transform the relaxation of international tensions that has already been achieved into a lasting peace.

    Strive to strengthen fraternal relations with the People's Republic of China and all people's democratic countries, and remember that the more united and stronger the socialist countries are, the more consolidated the cause of peace will be.

    Strengthen the friendship and cooperation with the fraternal people of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

    Strengthen the friendship and cooperation with the Republic of India, the Union of Burma, Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, Indonesia, and other peace-loving countries. Support those countries that do not want to be dragged into aggressive blocs. Cooperate with all forces that are willing to maintain peace.

    Develop and consolidate friendly relations with Finland, Austria, Sweden, and other neutral countries.

    Implement a positive policy of further improving relations with the United States, Britain, France, Italy, West Germany, Japan, and neighboring countries Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan, strive to strengthen mutual trust, extensively develop economic ties, and expand cultural and scientific exchanges and cooperation.

    Develop and strengthen the fraternal ties between the people of the Soviet Union and the working people of all countries.

    Be vigilant against the conspiracies of groups that are not interested in easing international tensions, and expose the sabotage activities of the enemies of peace in a timely manner. Take the necessary measures to further strengthen the defense capabilities of our socialist country, keep our national defense at the level of modern military technology and science, and ensure the security of our motherland.

    II

    The Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union notes with great satisfaction the further consolidation of the internal situation in the Soviet Union. Due to the consistent implementation of the Party's general line by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in the period of the summary, the various sectors of social production, the material welfare and cultural level of the people have been significantly improved, the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society has been further consolidated, and the power of the Soviet state has increased.

    The early completion and overfulfillment of the Fifth Five-Year Plan by the Soviet industrial sector is a great victory for the Party and the people. In 1955, the industrial output value was planned to be 170% of the 1950 level, but it actually reached 185%, of which the production of means of production was planned to be 180%, but it actually reached 191%, and the production of consumer goods was planned to be 165%, but it actually reached 176%.

    The Congress believes that it is necessary to resolutely strive to solve the following main economic tasks of the Soviet Union in the shortest historical period through the path of peaceful economic competition, that is, relying on the superiority of the socialist economic system, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of production per capita.

    The Communist Party believes that it is absolutely necessary to continue to guarantee the priority development of heavy industry in the future, especially the priority development of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industries, coal and oil industries, power, machinery manufacturing industry, chemicals and building materials production. The Congress also believes that the level of social production that has now been reached makes it possible to not only rapidly develop the production of means of production, but also to rapidly develop the production of consumer goods.

    The continuous progress of technology is a decisive condition for the further development of the entire industrial production. It is necessary to resolutely and systematically adopt the latest scientific achievements, technologies, and advanced experiences in industry and transportation, modernize existing equipment, improve and refine labor and production organization, and implement specialization and collaboration more widely in industry in order to rapidly increase labor productivity on this basis; and increasing labor productivity is the decisive condition for completing the task of developing production and further improving the people's welfare.

    The further development of the country's productive forces urgently requires the mobilization of new raw materials, fuel, and electricity resources, especially the exploitation of the huge natural wealth in the eastern regions of the country. In the next 10 to 15 years, the country's largest bases for coal mining and electricity production, the third large metallurgical base with an annual output of 15 million to 20 million tons of pig iron, and new machinery manufacturing centers should be established in the eastern regions.

    The Congress instructs all Party organizations to:

    Ensure that all industrial sectors and enterprises fulfill the tasks stipulated in the national plan not only in terms of total output, but also in terms of all varieties and quality indicators;

    Better utilize existing production capacity, make enterprises work rhythmically, avoid slack and tight situations and shock phenomena, and produce products evenly throughout the month, which requires greatly improving the planning work and material supply work of enterprises;

    Improve product quality, continuously reduce product costs, implement the strictest economy system, and implement economic accounting system;

    More widely use artificial raw materials and substitutes in production, and completely replace food used for technical purposes with synthetic raw materials during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period;

    The Soviet state increases basic investment in the national economy year by year. In order to use these investments most effectively, it is necessary to put construction work on the track of modern industrialization, continue the work of establishing large-scale regional construction institutions, improve design work, minimize the duration of construction, and widely use factory-produced prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and components.

    In the period covered by the report, the Central Committee of the CPSU carried out huge political and organizational work in agriculture. The Central Committee has taken effective measures to eliminate the unattended phenomenon in many agricultural production sectors and to organize the rapid development of agriculture.

    Of these measures, the following are of particular importance:

    Implementing a new planning system in agriculture that can give play to the creative initiative of collective farm members;

    Strengthening the material encouragement of collective farms and collective farmers in increasing the production of agricultural products;

    Sending thousands of Communist Party members and non-Party workers from cities and industrial centers to rural areas to strengthen the leadership cadres and specialized personnel cadres of collective farms;

    Further strengthening the technical equipment of agriculture, establishing fixed machine operators in machine tractor stations, and strengthening the leading personnel and engineering and technical cadres of machine tractor stations;

    Increasing state appropriations for the development of agriculture.

    When drafting the plan for the development of agriculture, the Central Committee correctly decided to first concentrate its efforts on vigorously developing the grain industry, because the grain industry is the foundation of the entire agricultural production, especially such an important sector as animal husbandry. The resolution passed by the Central Committee on reclaiming wasteland and on greatly expanding the planting area of ​​corn is of great significance.

    The Congress instructs the Central Committee to continue to spare no effort for the upsurge of agriculture, and mobilize the entire Party and the entire Soviet people to strive to provide the residents with abundant food and provide the light industry with abundant raw materials.

    It is necessary to ensure the further mechanization of agriculture, transition from the mechanization of individual tasks to the overall mechanization of the entire agricultural production in the shortest period of time, thoroughly improve publicity work, and adopt the scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union and foreign countries in production, and promote the experience of advanced collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state-owned farms, in order to strive to greatly reduce the amount of labor and the consumption of material resources in the production of agricultural products per unit, and increase the yield per unit area of ​​various crops and the productivity of animal husbandry.

    The Congress believes that now, the economic strength of many collective farms has greatly increased. In addition to the work of fully expanding production, which should always be given priority, serious attention should be paid to the work of constructing houses, clubs, children's welfare agencies, and other cultural life welfare agencies in collective farms.

    Raising the level of leadership over agriculture is a decisive condition for the further rapid upsurge of agricultural production.

    It is necessary to eliminate conservatism and red tape-bureaucratic methods in this regard, and eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible and lacking a sense of responsibility. Party organizations, Soviet organs, and agricultural organs should ensure specific leadership over each district, collective farm, state-owned farm, and machine tractor station, and should support the initiative of the masses in various ways, and increase the material encouragement of agricultural workers, including leading cadres, in expanding agricultural production.

    The Congress calls on Party organizations, trade union organizations, economic organs, and Communist Youth League organizations to launch national socialist competitions more widely, improve the leadership of competitions, further enhance the creative initiative of workers and collective farmers, and use this initiative to realize the tasks put forward by the Party and the government.

    The growth of industrial and agricultural production has created practical possibilities for continuously improving the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people. In the era of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 68%, the real wages of workers and staff increased by 39%, and the real income of collective farmers increased by 50%. The Congress fully approves the measures formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to further increase the real wages of workers and staff and the income of collective farmers, the measures to increase the wages of low-income workers, and the measures to rectify labor remuneration and strengthen material encouragement based on the labor achievements of staff.

    The decision adopted by the Central Committee of the CPSU on the transition to a seven-hour working day for all workers and staff members during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and on the implementation of a six-hour working day for workers in major industries engaged in underground work in the coal industry and mining industry, as well as for juvenile workers, is of extremely important political significance and national economic significance. This decision also stipulates that where it is deemed appropriate based on production conditions, the transition to a system of working five days a week, resting two days, and working eight hours a day. In the near future, the working day on Saturdays and the day before holidays will be shortened by two hours.

    When transitioning to a shortened working day, the wages of workers and staff members will not be reduced. The Congress unanimously approves this measure, which is fully in line with the interests of the Soviet working people, and is deeply convinced that these measures will be warmly supported by the entire Soviet people and will arouse them to a new labor upsurge to strive to complete the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union.

    The method of rectifying the pension system formulated by the Central Committee is of great significance. This method is to greatly increase low pensions, reduce unreasonably high pensions, improve the care for the elderly, improve the employment arrangements for the disabled, and enable them to engage in labor that is harmless to health and beneficial to society.

    During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, housing construction will double compared with the Fifth Five-Year Plan. In this regard, the primary task is to correctly use the Soviet state's appropriations for housing construction.

    The Congress approves the measures implemented by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union to rectify the work in this regard, that is, to eliminate manual work methods and various construction wastes, and to adopt industrialized construction methods; the Congress instructs Party organizations and economic organs at all levels to ensure the absolute completion of the state's housing construction plan, and to do their best to help workers and staff members build houses with their own private savings.

    The Congress believes that it is necessary to resolutely strengthen attention to the daily needs of residents, continue to increase public catering enterprises, reduce food prices, and improve food quality. At the same time, many daily service institutions—laundries, tailoring shops, repair shops, etc.—should also be added, and machines and appliances that reduce housework should be produced as soon as possible.

    Great achievements have been made in all aspects of cultural construction. Now universal seven-year education has been implemented, and universal ten-year education has already been implemented in large cities. We are creating conditions for gradually implementing universal ten-year education.

    The work of training specialized talents in our country's universities has been greatly expanded. With the constant and effective support of the Party and the Soviet government, Soviet scientists are working effectively for our national economy and strengthening the security of our motherland, and have made outstanding achievements in many scientific fields, including nuclear physics, mathematics, mechanics, and certain technical science departments.

    At the same time, the Congress pointed out serious shortcomings existing in cultural construction. The biggest shortcoming in school work is that teaching is to some extent divorced from life, and students graduating from schools do not have sufficient practical working ability. In order to implement comprehensive technical education in schools as soon as possible, it is necessary not only to set up new subjects to enable students to acquire basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production, but also to actually enable students to participate in the labor of enterprises, collective farms, state-owned farms, experimental farms, and school workshops. It is appropriate to start setting up some boarding schools in places that are beneficial to children's health. It is necessary to greatly expand the network of welfare institutions for preschool children. National education organs, state-owned enterprises, and collective farms should participate in this work.

    The main tasks in higher education are: to fully improve the quality of training specialized talents on the basis of closely combining learning with production, to correctly allocate universities domestically, to make universities close to production, and to adapt teaching work to modern technical levels. It is necessary to enable young engineers and agronomists to have sufficient knowledge of specific economics and production organization when they graduate from school.

    The Congress believes that it is necessary to fully strengthen the connection between the national scientific organs and production and the specific needs of the national economy, concentrate the creative forces of the scientific organs to solve the most important scientific and technological problems, and constantly improve the role of science in solving practical tasks in communist construction.

    The Congress believes that the further strengthening of the Soviet social system and state system, the alliance of the working class and collective farmers, and the further consolidation of the friendship and fraternal cooperation between the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union are one of the most important results of the Party's work in the period of the summary.

    The Congress fully approves the measures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to expand the powers of the organs of the republics in economic and cultural construction. In addition to maintaining the right of the various all-union ministries to exercise general leadership, determine planning tasks, supervise the completion of these tasks, supply equipment, and provide investment funds, it is also necessary to further expand the rights of the various ministries of the republics to conduct daily management of enterprises. This will further promote the creative initiative of the localities, further consolidate the various union republics, and strengthen the friendship between the various ethnic groups in our country.

    The Party has consistently based itself on Lenin's principle in its ethnic policy: socialism not only does not eliminate national differences and characteristics, but on the contrary, guarantees the comprehensive development and prosperity of the economy and culture of all ethnic groups. The Party will continue to pay great attention to this characteristic in all its practical work in the future.

    The great tasks of communist construction require further enhancing the creative initiative and initiative of the working people, and enabling the masses to participate more widely in the work of managing the state and participating in the various organizational and economic work of the state. To this end, it is necessary to vigorously develop Soviet democracy, persistently improve the work of Soviet organs at all levels in the central and local areas, and strengthen their ties with the masses. The Congress approves the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in streamlining administrative organs and improving the activities of their various links in recent years, and believes that this work must be continued, and irreconcilable struggle must be continued against bureaucracy and against taking an indifferent attitude towards the needs of residents in the future.

    The Congress fully approves the measures taken by the Central Committee of the CPSU in strengthening the Soviet legal system and strictly safeguarding the civil rights guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution, and instructs Party organizations and Soviet organs at all levels to vigilantly defend the legal system and resolutely and severely punish various manifestations of violations of discipline and law, arbitrariness, and destruction of socialist legal order.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet state must continue to educate Communist Party members and all working people in the spirit of high political vigilance, and constantly strengthen our heroic armed forces, which reliably protect the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and the security of the socialist motherland.

    III

    Because our Party takes the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism as its guide in its entire foreign and domestic policy and practical activities, because it has consistently and unwaveringly implemented the policies of building communism in our country and strengthening the international socialist camp, and because it holds high The banner of proletarian internationalism and the friendship of all peoples, our Party has achieved great achievements in the period between the Nineteenth Congress and the Twentieth Congress.

    The period since the Nineteenth Congress has been a period of continued growth in the strength and prestige of the CPSU, a period of consolidation of the Party's Leninist unity, and a period of enhancement of the Party's leading role in Soviet society. The Party has further strengthened itself ideologically, politically, and organizationally, and the Marxist-Leninist training of Party members has been strengthened. The decisive force of Party and government leadership—the Party's cadres—has greatly grown.

    The Twentieth Congress of the CPSU notes that the Central Committee has shouldered the complex and important tasks facing the Party and the state after the Nineteenth Congress, it has correctly solved the urgent problems of Party building, state building, and economic construction, and it has firmly and confidently led the country along the road indicated by Lenin.

    The Congress notes with satisfaction that the Central Committee has firmly defended the interests of the Party and the people in all its activities.

    The Congress fully agrees with the firm steps taken by the Central Committee of the CPSU in stopping the criminal conspiracy activities of the dangerous enemies of the Party and the people—Beria and his gang. This gave the plans of the imperialist spy agencies a serious blow and further strengthened the Party's combat effectiveness.

    The Congress fully agrees with the extensive work carried out by the Central Committee in restoring the Leninist norms of Party life, developing intra-party democracy, promoting the principles of collective leadership through the implementation of Marxist-Leninist policies, and in improving the Party's style and methods of work. Due to efforts to ensure adherence to the democratic norms of Party life, to oppose commandism and high-handed bureaucratic leadership methods, to carry out criticism and self-criticism, the initiative of Party members has been enhanced, the sense of responsibility of Communist Party members to the cause of the Party has been strengthened, and the political and production initiative of the working people has been further enhanced.

    Elaborating on the Marxist-Leninist concept of the role of the individual in history is of great significance for enhancing the initiative of Communist Party members and all working people. The Congress believes that the Central Committee's opposition to the cult of personality is completely correct. The prevalence of the cult of personality has narrowed the role of the Party and the masses, narrowed the role of collective leadership within the Party, and often led to serious shortcomings in our work; therefore, the Congress instructs the Central Committee to spare no effort to eliminate the remnants of the cult of personality, and to take the principle that the true creator of the new life is the masses of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party as its guide in all its activities.

    Due to the restoration of the Leninist norms of Party life, the development of intra-party democracy, the adherence to the principles of collective leadership, and the opposition to the cult of personality, the Central Committee has improved its leadership over the development of industry and agriculture, exposed acts of undermining the socialist legal system and taken the necessary remedial measures, called on everyone to fight against complacency, and mobilized the entire Party and all our cadres inside and outside the Party to accelerate the pace of development of Soviet society and to further improve the material welfare of the Soviet people.

    In order to ensure continued victorious advance, all Party members should continue to maintain high combat effectiveness, and all the work of our Party should be continuously and comprehensively improved. The Congress instructs the Central Committee to take measures to further improve the Party’s entire organizational work, especially the organizational work in economic construction. Party organizations should vigorously turn to the specific leadership of economic construction issues, and should pay more attention to studying the technology and economy

    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会
    关于苏联共产党中央委员会工作总结报告的决议
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会听取了和讨论了苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志所作的关于苏联共产党中央委员会的工作总结报告之后，决议如下：
    代表大会完全地和充分地赞同苏联共产党中央委员会的政治路线和具体工作；赞同中央委员会在它的总结报告中所提出的建议和结论。
    代表大会满意地注意到，由于党中央委员会和苏联政府执行了列宁的政策，由于在同各社会主义国家密切合作下的苏联人民的英勇的劳动，在我国建设共产主义社会和争取世界和平的斗争中已经取得了巨大的成就。
    代表大会热烈赞同苏共中央在总结所谈到的时期中在工农业方面所实行的正确的和及时的措施，这些措施保证了我们祖国威力的进一步增强，保证了社会主义经济有新的强大的高涨，保证了苏联人民的生活福利的大大提高。
    代表大会强调指出，苏共中央的胜利活动的基础是：创造性地运用马克思列宁主义学说，严格地遵守列宁的集体领导和党内民主的原则，坚定不移地执行列宁提出的关于我们党同人民保持不可分割的联系的指示。党这些年来一直高举着不朽列宁的伟大旗帜。
    一
    代表大会认为，总结所谈到的时期中国际关系方面的特点是，国际局势有了某些缓和，国际舞台上出现了巩固和平的现实前景。苏联以及中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家及时地采取了一些旨在巩固和平和安全的重要的外交措施。这些措施得到了一切爱好和平的力量的积极支持。
    整个历史进程鲜明地表明，国际关系的发展发生了根本的改变，社会主义的阵地加强了。现时代主要的特征是，社会主义越出了一个国家的范围，变成了一个世界体系，而资本主义已经没有能力阻挡这种有世界历史意义的发展。在苏联以及在中华人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国中，经济和文化正在不停地蓬勃高涨，劳动人民的福利在不断提高，人民在精神上和政治上的团结一致在不断加强，人民日益紧密地团结在共产党和工人党以及人民自由选举出来的政府的周围。南斯拉夫在社会主义建设方面也取得了重大的成就。沿着社会主义道路前进的国家的经济在健全的基础上，在平等合作和兄弟互助日益巩固的条件下向前发展。
    地区已经大大缩小了的资本主义世界的局势的特点是深刻矛盾的进一步加深。资本主义国家在战后10年中依靠经济军事化和军备竞赛、加紧对外经济扩张、更新固定资金以及剧烈加紧对劳动人民的剥削等等因素而取得的生产上的一定的增加，没有使资本主义的经济稳定。
    恰好相反，资本主义的经济是更加不稳定了。资本主义体系的总危机继续加深。资本主义的最深刻的矛盾——现代生产力和资本主义的生产关系之间的矛盾日益尖锐化；争夺销售市场和势力范围的资本主义国家之间的矛盾在不断加深；社会矛盾在不断增长和加深。由于工人阶级受到越来越厉害的剥削，由于物价不断上涨，由于用于军事目的的捐税急剧增加以及在许多资本主义国家中存在经常的失业现象，劳动人民的生活水平在不断降低，工人阶级、广大人民群众争取切身权利和维护切身利益的斗争日益加强。资本主义不断地走向新的经济的和社会的动荡。
    在这种局面下，明显地形成了国际事件发展过程中的两个基本的对立趋势。
    一方面是，以美国反动集团为首的帝国主义国家，在战争结束之后立刻就开始实行“实力地位”政策，这种政策反映了这些国家中最富侵略性的分子想镇压工人运动、民主运动和民族解放运动，想破坏社会主义阵营和建立他们的世界霸权的野心。这种政策实际上就是：无限制地扩充军备；沿苏联和人民民主国家的国境建立起美国军事基地；拼凑矛头指向社会主义阵营国家的侵略集团；展开反对社会主义国家的所谓“冷战”；策划新的流血战争。
    另一方面是，世界舞台上争取持久和平和各国安全的力量越来越壮大；这种力量展开了反对战争威胁和争取不同经济制度和社会制度的国家和平共处的积极斗争。国际社会主义阵营的不断巩固在这方面有决定性的意义，这个阵营对世界局势的发展起着日益增大的影响。
    由于世界舞台上出现了一批欧洲和亚洲的爱好和平的国家，它们宣布以不参加军事集团为自己外交政策的原则，因而和平的力量大大增强了。这样一来，广大的“和平地区”就形成了，这个地区中既包括社会主义国家，也包括欧洲和亚洲的非社会主义的爱好和平的国家，这个地区拥有全世界一半以上的人口。
    帝国主义的殖民主义制度的正在瓦解乃是战后时期具有全世界历史意义的事件。殖民地和半殖民地国家的人民所进行的民族解放斗争在最近10年中取得了伟大的胜利：占全世界人口一半的12亿以上的人，已经从殖民地和半殖民地附属地位中解放出来。完全消灭殖民主义体系的问题已经提到日程上来了。伟大的列宁所预见到的世界历史上的新的时期已经到来，这个时期就是东方人民积极参与决定全世界的命运并且成为国际关系中新的强大因素的时期。
    站在为维护和平、为劳动人民的利益和自己国家的民族独立而斗争的最前列的共产党，是反对战争威胁的最积极和最坚决的战士。同时，其他许多社会阶层也站在反对战争的立场上。使一切反对战争的力量结成统一战线，毫不松懈自己在维护和平的斗争中所作的努力，这对巩固和平是十分重要的。克服工人运动中的分裂以及共产党同社会党和其他在行动上愿意捍卫和平、对帝国主义压迫作斗争、保护本国的民族利益、保护民主和独立的其他政党建立切实的接触，在这方面是有巨大意义的。
    代表大会拥护苏共中央和苏联政府所执行的爱好和平的外交政策，由于执行了这一政策，在缓和国际紧张局势、巩固和平和加强民主力量的地位方面取得了巨大的成就。
    第二十次党代表大会认为中央委员会和苏联政府的路线是完全正确的，这一路线就是：在列宁的和平共处的原则的基础上实行同各国改善关系、加强信任和发展合作的方针。为许多国家和广大的社会阶层所承认的、著名的五项国际关系原则——互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、在平等互利的基础上发展国际关系、和平共处和经济合作——在这方面可以起很大的作用。这些原则在目前情况下是决定具有不同社会制度的国家的相互关系的最好形式，而且可以作为全世界各国之间的持久的和平关系的基础。
    生活完全证实了苏联、中华人民共和国和其他和平国家的建议是正确的而且是及时的，这些建议的目的是裁减军备，禁止原子武器和氢武器，保证欧洲集体安全和保证亚洲集体安全，解决这些极其重要的问题就可以为巩固的持久的和平奠定基础，就可以促成其他悬而未决的重要问题，譬如德国问题的解决。
    苏联和美国这两个世界上最大的强国之间以及苏联和英国、法国这些大国之间如果能够建立巩固的友好关系，对巩固世界和平将有重大的意义。
    第二十次代表大会认为，苏联方面为达到这个目的而采取的措施是适时的、正确的，并且表示完全赞同这些措施。
    保障持久和平和欧洲各国安全的利益，要求进一步改善苏联和西欧各国之间的关系。
    和英国、法国、意大利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、瑞典、芬兰、挪威、希腊、奥地利以及所有欧洲国家一样，苏联对防止在欧洲发生新的战争是有切身利害关系的，欧洲曾经是第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战的主要战场。德国人民对这件事情也有切身利害关系。因此，为防止发生新的军事冲突而斗争的共同利益，把欧洲各个国家和人民团结在一起。
    扩大和加强苏联同东方各国的友谊和合作，在目前国际局势中将发挥卓越的作用。鉴于这一任务的解决具有重大的意义。第二十次代表大会赞同最近同印度共和国、缅甸、阿富汗和埃及建立起来的良好的友谊关系。
    阿拉伯各国人民的日益广泛地要求保卫和巩固本民族的独立的愿望，是符合加强和平和民主的事业的。
    第二十次代表大会满意地指出，苏联几乎已经同所有的邻国建立了友好、睦邻的关系。毫无疑问，苏联同伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦之间如果建立正常关系，是符合这些国家的切身利益、符合和平事业和各国人民的安全的利益的。
    国际贸易和发展文化联系，对扩大各国合作的基础会起巨大的作用。
    第二十次代表大会指出，像两个制度的和平共处、现时代防止战争的可能性和不同的国家过渡到社会主义的形式这样一些根本的、带有原则性的、有关现代国际局势发展的问题，在目前具有特别重要的意义。
    列宁的关于社会制度不同的国家和平共处的原则，过去和现在一直是苏联外交政策的总路线。
    我们的党正在领导我国共产主义社会的建设，它坚决反对发动战争。党是从列宁的这个不可动摇的指示出发的：在这个或者那个国家内建立新的社会制度是这个或者那个国家人民内部的事情。代表大会满意地指出，和平共处的原则正在获得越来越广泛的承认。
    苏联、社会主义国家和其他爱好和平的国家、以及一切国家最广大的人民群众的最重要的任务，是维护和巩固持久和平，防止新战争和新侵略。在现代的国际条件下，已经有现实的可能性不让帝国主义的侵略势力把各国人民投入新战争，而这种战争在现在的军事技术水平上，会给各国人民带来无穷尽的灾难和破坏。现在，世界上不仅存在着资本主义体系；而且还存在着强大的爱好和平的社会主义阵营，爱好和平的力量在这个阵营中不但拥有防止侵略的精神手段，而且还拥有防止侵略的物质手段。此外，还有总人口达好几亿的一大批其他国家在积极地反对战争。还有着强大的世界范围的争取和平的运动。在资本主义国家中工人运动已经成为巨大的力量。
    在这种情况下，列宁的这个原理当然还是有效的：只要存在着帝国主义，爆发战争的经济基础也就保持着。正因为这样，我们就必须保持最高度的警惕。只要世界上还存在着资本主义，代表资本主义垄断组织利益的反动势力今后仍将力图进行军事冒险和侵略，可能企图发动战争。但是，战争的注定的不可避免性是没有的。现在有着这样一种强大的社会力量和政治力量，这种力量拥有重要的手段来阻止帝国主义发动战争，而如果帝国主义者企图发动战争，这种力量就会给侵略者以歼灭性的反击，粉碎他们的冒险计划。为此，就应当使一切反对战争的力量保持警惕和动员起来，应该使它们统一行动，并且不放松维护和巩固和平的斗争。
    由于国际局势发生了有利于社会主义的深刻变化，各国从资本主义过渡到社会主义的事业出现了新的前景。
    苏联共产党是从列宁的这个原理出发的：“一切国家都将走向社会主义，这是不可避免的，但是道路并不是完全相同的，在这种或者那种民主形式方面，在这种或者那种无产阶级专政形式方面，以及在社会生活各个方面实行社会主义改造的这种或者那种速度方面，各个国家将各有其特点。”（列宁全集第23卷第58页）
    沿着社会主义道路前进的各国发展的历史经验充分证实了列宁的这一个原理。目前除了按照社会主义原则改造社会的苏维埃形式以外，还有人民民主的形式。人民民主的形式在十年中经受了各方面的考验，已经被证明是完全正确的。在人民民主国家中，随着各国条件的不同，也有不少不同的式样和差别。中华人民共和国的社会主义建设形式有着许多特点。它的经济在革命胜利前非常落后，并且具有半封建半殖民地性质。人民民主的国家取得了决定性的控制地位以后，采取了和平改造私营工商业和逐步使私营工商业变成社会主义经济组成部分的方针。
    今后各国过渡到社会主义的形式将越来越多种多样，这是完全合乎规律的。而且过渡到社会主义的各种形式的实现，并不是在任何条件下都一定要同内战联系起来的。列宁主义教导说，统治阶级是不会自愿地放弃政权的。但是，为过渡到社会主义而进行的阶级斗争的尖锐程度或大或小，在过渡中使用不使用暴力，与其说取决于无产阶级，不如说取决于剥削者对绝大多数劳动人民的意志的对抗程度，取决于剥削阶级本身是不是使用暴力。
    毫无疑问，在资本主义还强而有力并且掌握着庞大的军事警察机构的若干资本主义国家里，阶级斗争的急剧尖锐化是不可避免的。
    同时，由于国际舞台上发生了有利于社会主义的根本变化，由于社会主义的吸引力在工人、农民和劳动知识分子中间大大增长，社会主义的胜利具有了更加有利的条件。在若干资本主义国家里，工人阶级在它的先锋队的领导下，在目前的条件下有着现实的可能把绝大多数人民团结在自己的领导下，并且保证使基本的生产资料转入人民手中。右翼资产阶级政党和它们所组成的政府越来越多地遭到破产。在这种条件下，工人阶级把劳动农民、广大知识分子和一切爱国力量团结在自己的周围，给不能够放弃同资本家和地主妥协的政策的机会主义分子以坚决的打击，就有可能使反动的、反人民的势力遭受失败，在议会中争取到巩固的多数，并且使它从资产阶级民主机关变成表达真正人民意志的工具。
    代表大会着重指出，社会主义在其他国家的胜利所以能够有更加有利的条件，只是因为社会主义已经在苏联取得了胜利，并且正在人民民主国家中取得胜利。革命的马克思列宁主义的胜利以及对改良主义和机会主义思想进行的始终不渝和坚定不移的斗争，曾经是取得上述的胜利的必要条件。
    在对外政策方面，代表大会向苏联共产党中央委员会提出以下任务：
    坚定不移地执行列宁提出的社会制度不同的各国和平共处的政策。为和平和各国人民的安全的事业、为建立国际间的信任而积极斗争，努力使已经取得的国际紧张局势的缓和转变成为持久的和平。
    努力加强同中华人民共和国和所有人民民主国家的兄弟关系，要记住，社会主义国家越团结、越强大，和平事业就越巩固。
    加强同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国兄弟人民的友谊和合作。
    加强同印度共和国、缅甸联邦、阿富汗、埃及、叙利亚、印度尼西亚和其他主张和平的国家的友谊和合作。支持那些不愿意让自己被拖入侵略集团的国家。同一切愿意维护和平的力量合作。
    发展和巩固同芬兰、奥地利、瑞典和其他中立国家的友好关系。
    执行进一步改善同美国、英国、法国、意大利、西德、日本，以及邻国伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦的关系的积极政策，争取加强相互的信任，广泛地发展经济联系，扩大文化和科学方面的接触和合作。
    发展和加强苏联人民同所有国家劳动人民的兄弟联系。
    要警惕地注意那些对缓和国际紧张局势不感兴趣的集团的阴谋，及时地揭穿和平敌人的破坏活动。要采取必要的措施来进一步加强我们社会主义国家的防御能力，使我们的国防保持在现代的军事技术和科学的水平上，保障我们祖国的安全。
    二
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会非常满意地指出苏联内部情况的进一步巩固。由于苏联共产党中央委员会一贯地执行党的总路线，在总结所谈到的这一段时期内，社会生产的各个部门、人民的物质福利和文化水平得到了显著的提高，苏维埃社会在精神上和政治上的团结更加巩固了，苏维埃国家的威力增长了。
    苏联工业部门提前完成和超额完成了第五个五年计划是党和人民的极大的胜利。1955年工业产值按五年计划规定是1950年水平的170％，而实际上达到了185％，其中生产资料的生产按计划是180％，而实际上达到了191％，消费资料的生产按计划是165％，而实际上达到了176％。
    代表大会认为必须坚决为通过和平的经济竞赛的途径，在最短的历史时期内解决苏联的下述主要的经济任务而斗争，这个任务就是，依靠社会主义经济制度的优越性，使生产量在按人口平均计算方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    共产党认为绝对必要的是，今后继续保证重工业的优先发展，首先是黑色和有色冶金工业、采煤和石油工业、动力、机器制造工业、化学品和建筑材料的生产的优先发展。代表大会同时也认为，社会生产现在已经达到的水平使得能够不仅迅速发展生产资料的生产，而且也迅速发展消费品的生产。
    技术的不断进步，是整个工业生产进一步发展的决定性条件。必须坚决地、有计划地在工业和运输业中采用最新的科学成就、技术和先进经验，使现有设备现代化，改善和改进劳动和生产组织，更广泛地在工业中实行专业化和协作，以便在这一基础上迅速提高劳动生产率；而提高劳动生产率是完成发展生产和进一步增进人民福利的这一任务的决定性条件。
    国家生产力的进一步发展，迫切要求动用新的原料、燃料和电力资源，首先是开发国家东部地区巨大的天然财富。在今后10年到15年间，在东部地区应当建立起国家的采煤和电力生产的最大基地、年产生铁1，500万到2，000万吨的第三个大冶金基地以及新的机器制造中心。
    代表大会责成所有党组织：
    保证所有工业部门和企业不但在总产量方面，而且在全部品种和质量指标方面完成国家计划规定的任务；
    更好地利用现有的生产能力，要使企业有节奏地工作，避免时松时紧和突击的现象，全月均匀地生产产品，这要求大力改进企业的计划工作和材料的供应工作；
    提高产品质量，不断地降低产品成本，实行最严格的节约制度，贯彻经济核算制；
    在生产中更广泛地采用人造原料和代用品，要在第六个五年计划期间以合成原料完全代替用于技术目的的食物；
    苏维埃国家逐年增加对国民经济的基本投资。为了最有效地利用这些投资，必须使建筑工作走上现代工业化的轨道、继续进行建立大规模的地区性建筑机构的工作，改进设计工作，最大限度地缩短建筑的期限，广泛地利用工厂生产的装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件。
    在报告所谈到的时期中，苏共中央委员会在农业方面进行了巨大的政治工作和组织工作。中央委员会在消除许多农业生产部门中的无人照管现象方面和组织急速发展农业方面采取了有效的措施。
    在所采取的这些措施中具有特别重要意义的是：
    在农业中实行了可以发挥集体农庄庄员的创造性积极性的新的制订计划的制度；
    在增加农产品的生产中，加强对集体农庄和集体农民的物质鼓励；
    从城市和工业中心派遣成千上万的共产党员和非党工作人员到农村去，来加强集体农庄的领导干部和专门人材的干部；
    进一步加强农业的技术装备，在机器拖拉机站中设立固定的操使机器的干部，加强机器拖拉机站的领导人员和工程技术干部；
    增加国家对发展农业的拨款。
    中央委员会在草拟发展农业的计划的时候，正确地决定首先集中力量大力发展谷物业，因为谷物业是整个农业生产、特别是像畜牧业这样重要的部门的基础。中央委员会所通过的关于开垦生荒地和关于大大地扩大玉蜀黍播种面积的决议，具有重大的意义。
    代表大会责成中央委员会毫不松懈地继续为农业的高涨而努力，动员全党和全体苏联人民为争取给居民提供丰足的粮食、给轻工业提供丰足的原料而斗争。
    必须保证农业的进一步机械化，在最短的时期内从个别工作的机械化过渡到整个农业生产的全盘机械化，彻底改进宣传工作，并且在生产中采用苏联和外国的科学技术成就，推广先进集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的经验，以便在这种基础上争取大大地降低单位农产品生产中的劳动量和物质资料的消耗量，提高各种农作物单位面积产量和畜牧业的产品生产率。
    代表大会认为，现在，许多集体农庄的经济力量已经大大增长，除了应当始终居于首位的全力扩展生产的工作以外，应当认真注意在集体农庄里建筑住宅、俱乐部、儿童福利机关和其他文化生活福利机关的工作。
    提高对农业的领导水平，是农业生产进一步迅速高涨的决定性条件。
    必须在这方面消除墨守陈规和文牍—官僚主义的方法，消除无人负责和缺乏责任心的现象。党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关应当保证对每一个区、集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站进行具体领导，应当多方支持群众的倡议，在扩大农业生产上，提高对农业工作者、包括领导干部的物质鼓励。
    代表大会号召党组织、工会组织、经济机关和共青团组织更广泛地展开全民社会主义竞赛，改进对竞赛的领导，进一步提高工人和集体农民的创造性的主动精神，把这种主动精神用于实现党和政府所提出的任务。
    工业和农业生产的增长，为不断提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平创造了实际的可能性。在第五个五年计划的年代里，苏联的国民收入增加了68％，工人和职员的实际工资增加了39％，而集体农民的实际收入增加了50％。代表大会完全赞同苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议制定的关于进一步提高工人和职员的实际工资以及集体农民的收入的措施，关于提高收入低的工作人员工资的措施，以及关于整顿劳动报酬和加强根据工作人员的劳动成果而给予物质鼓励的措施。
    苏共中央所通过的关于在第六个五年计划期间过渡到全部工人职员实行七小时工作制、并且对于在煤炭工业、采矿工业中从事地面下工作的主要行业的工人以及未成年工人实行六小时工作制的决定，具有极重要的政治意义和国民经济意义。这个决定还规定，凡是根据生产条件认为适宜的地方，过渡到每周工作五天、休息两天、每天工作八小时的制度。在最近就要实行把星期六及假日前一天的工作日缩短两小时。
    在过渡到缩短工作日的时候，并不减少工人和职员的工资。代表大会一致赞同这种完全符合苏联劳动人民的利益的措施，并且深信，这些措施一定会得到全体苏联人民的热烈拥护，并且会引起他们为争取完成苏联发展国民经济第六个五年计划的新的劳动高潮。
    中央委员会所拟定的整顿养老金制度的办法具有重大的意义，这种办法就是要大大增加数额低的养老金，减低数额高得不合理的养老金，改善对老年人的照顾，改进对残废者的就业安排，使他们能够从事对健康无损而对社会有益的劳动。
    在第六个五年计划期间，住宅建设和第五个五年计划比较将增加一倍。在这方面，首要的任务是要正确地使用苏维埃国家对住宅建设的拨款。
    代表大会赞同苏共中央和苏联部长会议所实行的整顿这方面的工作的各项措施，即消除手工业方式的工作方法和各种建筑上的浪费，采用工业化的建筑方法；代表大会责成各级党组织和经济机关保证绝对完成国家的住宅建设计划，并且尽力帮助工人和职员用他们自己的私人储蓄来建筑住宅。
    代表大会认为，必须坚决地加强对居民日常生活需要的注意，继续增设公共饮食企业，减低饮食品价格和改进饮食品质量。同时，也应该增设许多日常服务机构——洗衣铺、成衣铺、修理铺等等，尽速增产减轻家务劳动的机器和用具。
    在文化建设的一切方面已经获得了巨大成就。现在普遍实行了七年制普及教育，而在大城市中已经在实行十年制普及教育。我们正在为逐步实行十年制普及教育创造条件。
    我国高等学校中培养专门人才的工作已经大大扩大了。在党和苏维埃政府的经常的和有效的支持下，苏联科学家在为我们的国民经济和加强我们祖国的安全而有成效地工作着，在许多科学领域中取得了卓越的成绩，其中包括核子物理学、数学、力学以及某些技术科学部门。
    同时，代表大会指出了在文化建设方面存在的严重缺点。学校工作的最大缺点是教学在某种程度上脱离生活，从学校毕业出来的学生没有足够的实际工作能力。为了尽快地在学校中实行综合技术教育，必须不仅仅是设立新的科目来使学生获得工农业生产方面的基本知识，并且还必须实际使学生参加企业、集体农庄、国营农场、实验场和学校工场的劳动。在有益儿童健康的地方着手设立一些寄宿学校是适当的。必须大大扩大学龄前儿童的福利机构网。国民教育机关和国家企业、以及集体农庄都要参加这一工作。
    高等教育方面的主要任务是：在学习紧密结合生产的基础上，全力改善培养专门人才的工作质量，在国内正确地配置高等学校，使高等学校接近生产，使教学工作适应现代技术水平。必须使年青工程师和农艺师在学校毕业的时候，就在具体的经济学和组织生产方面具有足够的知识。
    代表大会认为，必须全力加强国家科学机关同生产、同国民经济的具体需要的联系，集中科学机关的创造力量来解决最重要的科学技术问题，不断地提高科学在解决共产主义建设中的实际任务的作用。
    代表大会认为，苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的进一步加强，工人阶级和集体农民的联盟以及苏联各族人民之间的友谊和兄弟合作的进一步巩固，是共产党在总结所谈到的时期中工作的最重要的结果之一。
    代表大会完全赞同苏联共产党中央委员会所采取的关于扩大共和国机关在经济和文化建设方面的权力的措施。除了保持各全联盟部有权实行总的领导、决定计划任务、监督这些任务的完成、供应装备、供给投资经费以外，同时还必须进一步扩大共和国各部对企业进行日常管理的权利。这将会更加发挥地方的创造主动精神，进一步巩固各加盟共和国以及加强我国各族人民的友谊。
    党在民族政策方面一贯依据列宁的这个原则：社会主义不仅不取消民族的差别和特点，相反地，保证使一切民族的经济和文化得到全面的发展和繁荣。党今后在一切实际工作中仍然将十分注意地考虑这种特点。
    共产主义建设的伟大任务要求进一步提高劳动人民的创造性积极性和主动性，使群众更加广泛地参加管理国家的工作，参与国家的各种组织和经济工作。为此必须大力发展苏维埃民主，坚持不懈地改进中央和地方各级苏维埃机关的工作，加强它们同群众的联系。代表大会赞同苏联共产党中央委员会最近几年来在精简行政管理机构方面，在改进它们的各个环节的活动方面的工作，并且认为必须继续进行这项工作，今后要继续同官僚主义、同对居民的需要采取漠不关心的态度进行不调和的斗争。
    代表大会完全赞同苏共中央在加强苏维埃法制、在严格维护苏联宪法所保障的公民权利方面所采取的措施，并且责成各级党组织和苏维埃机关警惕地保卫法制，坚决和严厉地制裁各种违法乱纪、专横和破坏社会主义法律秩序的表现。
    共产党和苏维埃国家今后仍然必须以高度政治警惕性的精神来教育共产党员和全体劳动人民，不断地加强可靠地保卫着苏联人的和平劳动和社会主义祖国安全的我们英勇的武装部队。
    三
    由于我们的党在整个外交和国内政策和实际活动中都以无往不胜的马克思列宁主义学说作为自己的指针，由于它始终一贯、坚定不移地执行了在我们国家内建设共产主义的政策和加强国际社会主义阵营的政策，并且由于它高举着无产阶级国际主义和各国人民友好的旗帜，我们的党已经在第十九次代表大会和第二十次代表大会之间的时期中获得了伟大的成就。
    第十九次代表大会以来的这段时期是苏共力量和威信继续增长的时期、党的列宁主义的团结获得巩固和党在苏维埃社会中的领导作用获得提高的时期。党已经在思想上、政治上和组织上进一步地加强了自己，党员的马克思列宁主义锻炼已经加强了。党和政府领导的决定性力量——党的干部已经大大成长起来了。
    苏共第二十次代表大会注意到：中央委员会负起了党和国家在第十九次代表大会以后所面临的复杂而重要的任务，它已经正确地解决了党的建设、国家建设和经济建设的迫切问题，并且坚定地和充满信心地引导国家沿着列宁所指示的道路前进。
    代表大会满意地注意到中央委员会在它的整个活动中都坚定地保卫党和人民的利益。
    代表大会完全同意苏共中央委员会在制止党和人民的危险的敌人——贝利亚和他的匪帮——的罪恶阴谋活动方面所采取的坚定步骤。这就给予帝国主义间谍机关的计划一个严重的打击，并且进一步加强了党的战斗力。
    代表大会完全同意中央委员会在恢复党的生活的列宁主义准则、发展党内民主、通过执行马克思列宁主义的政策来促进集体领导的原则方面以及在改进党的工作作风和方法方面所进行的大量工作。由于努力保证坚持党的生活的民主准则，反对命令主义和高高在上的官僚主义领导方法，开展批评和自我批评，党员的积极性已经提高，共产党员对党的事业的责任感已经加强，劳动人民的政治和生产的积极性已经有了进一步的高涨。
    详尽地解释马克思列宁主义关于个人在历史中的作用的概念，对于提高共产党员和全体劳动人民的积极性有重大的意义。代表大会认为，中央委员会反对个人崇拜是完全正确的，个人崇拜的流行曾经缩小党和群众的作用，缩小党内集体领导的作用，并且常常使我们工作中发生严重的缺点；因此代表大会责成中央委员会毫不放松地努力肃清个人崇拜的残余，并且在它的一切活动中以这样的原则作为自己的指针：新生活的真正创造者是在共产党领导下的人民群众。
    由于恢复了党的生活的列宁主义准则，发展了党内民主，坚持了集体领导的原则和反对了个人崇拜，中央委员会已经改进了对工业和农业发展的领导，揭露了破坏社会主义法制的行为并且采取了必要的补救措施，号召大家为反对自得自满的情绪而斗争，并且动员全党和我们党内外的全体工作人员来加快苏维埃社会的发展速度，来进一步提高苏联人民的物质福利。
    为了保证继续胜利前进，全体党员应当继续保持高昂的战斗力，我们党的全部工作应当在各方面不断改进。代表大会责成中央委员会采取措施，来更进一步改进党的整个组织工作，首先是经济建设方面的组织工作。党组织应当大力转向具体地领导经济建设的问题，应当更加注意研究工业企业、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站以及国营农场的技术和经济，以便胜任地指导它们的工作。
    组织工作的水平主要取决于检查决议执行情况的方法，以及挑选和培养干部和任命共产党员担任经济和文化建设的各个职位的方法。
    代表大会认为，必须更加注意提拔青年工作人员，包括妇女在内，和增加从事生产的共产党员的数目。
    代表大会认为有些党组织对调整党员人数的增加的问题注意不够，这是不对的。代表大会根据这样一个前提，即：最重要的不是党员数量的增加而是党员质量的提高，责成各级党组织更加注意挑选最先进的、主要是工人和集体农民中间的人，个别地参加到党的队伍中来。
    代表大会责成中央委员会根据改变了的情况，继续进行它的改进党和苏维埃机关的组织机构和活动方式的工作。
    应该特别着重进一步加强区一级的党的活动。代表大会承认党在这个方面已经完成的许多工作，并且认为改组农村区党委会机构以及为机器拖拉机站地区建立以区党委书记为首的指导员小组的做法是正确的。
    但是许多区组织的工作水平还不能适应党的需要。这是因为在一些地区，那些被任命为机器拖拉机站地区的区党委书记或者指导员的人工作能力薄弱，并且没有具备必要的业务水平和政治水平。
    今天当国家面临着发展农业的巨大任务的时候，用有能力的和熟练的人员来加强区组织具有特别重要的意义。区一级的工作人员目前正在农村基层党组织、机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场直接进行工作，组织农业工作者完成党和政府的指示。这意味着急剧发展农业这件全民事业能不能取得成就，今天在决定性的程度上决定于区组织的水平。因此必须保证以有办法的和有首创精神的群众组织者，对农业有丰富知识的人充任区党委员会的领导职位，特别是机器拖拉机站地区的书记和指导员的职位，以及区苏维埃执行委员会里的职位，为达到这个目的，应该进行坚持不懈的努力，一方面通过提拔在集体农庄和国营农场涌现出来的当地工作人员中的优秀人物，同时通过吸收城市和工业区的人们参加工作，来加强区一级的领导核心，并且为区的党组织和苏维埃机关的领导人员们在机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场的经济活动结果方面提供直接的物质上的鼓励。
    同时应该采取步骤继续加强市的党组织，尽一切努力来提高党的市委员会和市的区委员会在管理工业企业、特别是在生产上采用最新的科学技术成就和先进方法方面，以及在管理一切满足居民日常需要的企业和组织方面所负的责任。
    继续加强全党和各个党组织同广大劳动人民之间的联系，是胜利完成党所面临的任务的最主要的条件。代表大会要求各级党组织注意必须使劳动人民代表苏维埃和工会组织的工作活跃起来，以求大大提高它们在经济和文化建设方面、在满足居民的日常需要和要求方面以及在对劳动人民的共产主义教育方面的作用。
    列宁共产主义青年团在国家的社会生活中起了很重要的作用，它充分参加了经济和文化建设，并且帮助党以共产主义的精神教育青年。但是，在共青团组织的活动中，特别是在它们的思想和教育工作中存在着严重的缺点。共青团组织往往不善于吸引青年参加实际工作，而用决议、虚饰浮夸和吵吵嚷嚷代替有效率的日常的组织工作。要消灭这些缺点，必须改进党对共青团的领导。党组织应该更多地注意为教育青年群众创造必要的条件和为他们提供必不可少的文化和娱乐设备，以及确保共青团团员和全体苏联青年更积极地参加政治、经济和文化建设以及国家的整个社会和政治生活。
    在思想工作方面，代表大会认为消除宣传和共产主义建设实践之间的脱节现象是最重要的任务之一。我们的宣传和鼓动工作应该同建立共产主义的物质和生产基础、创造丰富的物质和文化财富、加强公民的共产主义觉悟、永远根除和马克思列宁主义的创造精神不相容的教条主义和学究习气的任务更密切地联系起来。宣传工作的任务不仅仅是解释马克思列宁主义的理论，而且要促使这种理论付诸实践。
    代表大会注意到，中央委员会及时地反对了企图脱离党的优先发展重工业的总路线的做法，也反对了在我国建成社会主义问题和其他一些理论问题上的混乱。
    代表大会责成中央委员会继续像保护眼珠一样地保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，并且在建设共产主义的实际工作过程中，通过对新的历史经验和生活现实的总结，创造性地丰富马克思列宁主义。同时必须毫不松懈地进行斗争，反对资产阶级意识形态的表现。
    代表大会强调指出，对劳动人民、特别是对年青一代的共产主义教育是具有最重要的意义的任务；代表大会责成党的组织为了这些目的更加充分和更加有效地利用进行思想教育的一切工具——宣传、报刊、广播、文化和教育的组织和机构、科学、文学和艺术。
    代表大会表示确信，用马克思列宁主义的伟大学说武装起来的苏联共产党，将会把全体苏联人民更加紧密地团结在它的旗帜下，领导他们走向具有世界历史意义的新的共产主义的胜利。
