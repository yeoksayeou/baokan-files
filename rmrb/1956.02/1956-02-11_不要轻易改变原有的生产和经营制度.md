The State Council's "Decision on Several Matters Concerning the Socialist Transformation of Private Industry, Commerce, and Handicraft Industries," stipulates that after private industrial and commercial enterprises are approved for joint state-private ownership, they should generally continue production and operation as before for about six months. This allows for sufficient preparation, careful investigation and research, and overall planning to properly carry out necessary economic restructuring and enterprise transformation step by step, industry by industry. Similarly, for the socialist transformation of handicraft industries, it is stipulated that after the implementation of cooperation, there should also be a certain period of time to temporarily continue production and operation as before. This allows for careful study and planning before properly carrying out restructuring and transformation work. This decision of the State Council is entirely necessary and timely, and all localities should conscientiously implement it according to their different local conditions.

Since January of this year, the socialist transformation movement of private industry, commerce, and handicraft industries in our country has been surging forward with great momentum. As of January 27, all private industrial and commercial enterprises in 118 large and medium-sized cities and 193 counties across the country have been approved to implement joint state-private ownership, and handicraft industries in these areas have also been approved to implement cooperation. The development of the movement is generally healthy. However, approving the implementation of joint state-private ownership for all industries of private industry and commerce and approving the complete implementation of cooperation for handicraft industries does not mean that the socialist transformation work has been completed, but only marks the beginning of further in-depth transformation. After private industrial and commercial enterprises are approved for joint state-private ownership, a series of tasks such as asset verification, economic restructuring, enterprise transformation, production arrangements, and personnel arrangements need to be continued. After individual handicraft industries completely implement cooperation, it is also necessary to conduct comprehensive planning and properly carry out restructuring and transformation work based on the different conditions and characteristics of each handicraft industry. These tasks are very complex, and it takes considerable time to complete them.

However, whether it is industrial and commercial enterprises or handicraft industries, the first thing they must do is strive to improve the current level of production and management. Because the ultimate goal of the state's socialist transformation of private industry, commerce, and handicraft industries is to create new and higher labor productivity and management levels to meet the requirements of our country's current stage of national economic development and better satisfy the growing and diverse needs of our people. Therefore, in carrying out the socialist transformation of private industry, commerce, and handicraft industries, we must ensure that the newly formed joint state-private enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives better meet the needs of the people. They should not only not perform worse than in the past, but they should also perform even better.

For this purpose, when transforming private industry, commerce, and handicraft industries, special attention should be paid to not lightly changing their original production and sales patterns, management systems, and service systems. We know that an industry is a naturally formed economic form, and each industry has its own historical characteristics, and each link in the industry has its own inherent connections. In the previous period, we were mainly busy carrying out the work of joint state-private ownership and cooperation for all industries, and we did not have time to conduct a comprehensive investigation and study of the industry conditions, production and sales patterns, and management systems of private industry, commerce, and handicraft industries. Therefore, we should not rush to change the original production and management systems at all; only when we have clearly analyzed and studied production technology and management methods in the future can we gradually reform the unreasonable parts of the industry. As for certain obviously unreasonable situations and difficult problems existing in certain industries, in order to facilitate production and operation, they should of course also be adjusted and resolved in a timely manner with the approval of the leading organs. Industries that are fully prepared, have conducted detailed investigations and research, and have proposed an overall restructuring plan can also be restructured with the approval of the provincial (autonomous region) and municipal leading organs. However, these can only be individual and focused cases. In short, economic restructuring, commercial network adjustment, enterprise transformation and other work cannot be resolved through mass movements, but must be carried out step by step, industry by industry, under the unified leadership and arrangement of the central and local governments, with a certain period of investigation and research, overall planning, and full preparation. Only in this way can we ensure that the socialist transformation work continues to develop healthily and achieve the goal of improving production and management levels and meeting the needs of the broad masses of the people.

It must be pointed out that private industrial, commercial, and handicraft industries in the past had their own expertise and unique aspects in production and operation. Some were welcomed and loved by the people because of the good quality of certain products or their unique flavor; others attracted a portion of customers because of certain unusual varieties and specifications. If, after joint state-private ownership and cooperation, we do not pay attention to preserving their original characteristics and technologies, it will be easy to reduce quality and reduce the variety of designs and colors. Although many of the original production technologies and management methods of private industrial, commercial, and handicraft industries are unreasonable and must be changed, there are also many good ones that should be retained and even promoted. Engaging in socialism is by no means a complete negation of all old things, but rather to accept as much as possible the good and useful parts for the people, so that they can adapt to the requirements of socialism. This, of course, cannot be achieved by lightly changing the original systems and methods. Lightly changing the original systems and methods will only mess things up.

Will the stipulation to continue production and operation as before for about six months dampen the socialist enthusiasm of the masses? No, it will not be like that. Since our socialist transformation is to improve the level of production and management, not to reduce the level of production and management, then, is it not better to stay put for now, stabilize, create conditions, and then move better in the future? It can be seen that this regulation is not passive but active. It should be seen that a series of work such as economic restructuring and enterprise transformation of the original private industrial and commercial enterprises must be carried out industry by industry, and it is impossible to start together and advance at the same pace. Six months is not a long time, and it is not slow to do these tasks well within six months. At present, the task of the industrial, commercial, and handicraft industry authorities is first of all to mobilize the workers, clerks, engineers, technicians, and handicraft laborers in the original private industrial and commercial enterprises to strive to improve production, actively improve the quality of service work, and quickly guide their socialist enthusiasm to do a good job in current production and operation.

The State Council's stipulation on continuing production and operation as before for about six months after private industrial and commercial enterprises are approved for joint state-private ownership shows the government's trust in them and also increases their responsibilities. Many industrialists and businessmen have been enthusiastic, working hard to produce, and actively improving management after their enterprises were approved for joint state-private ownership. This is a good phenomenon. However, at present, some industrialists and businessmen do have varying degrees of waiting and dependence, and even put production and operation aside, which is an attitude that should be corrected. People in industrial and commercial circles must clearly recognize their responsibilities in joint state-private enterprises, strive to improve the specifications and quality of products, increase varieties and designs, improve production, improve management, and actively assist the government in preparing for economic restructuring and enterprise transformation. In the process of these tasks, there are opportunities for industrialists and businessmen to contribute their efforts everywhere. We call on all industrialists and businessmen to continue to strive to make more contributions to the socialist cause with practical actions to do a good job in current production and operation.

### 不要轻易改变原有的生产和经营制度

    不要轻易改变原有的生产和经营制度
    国务院“关于目前私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造中若干事项的决定”，规定私营工商业在批准公私合营以后，一般应在半年左右时间内，照旧生产经营，以便在有充分准备，经过仔细考察研究、统筹规划的条件下，妥善地逐行逐业进行必要的经济改组、企业改造等工作。对手工业的社会主义改造，同样规定在实行合作化以后，也要有一定的时间，暂时照旧生产和经营，以便经过仔细研究和规划以后，再妥善地进行改组和改造工作。国务院的这个决定，是完全必要的、适时的，各地应该按照当地的不同情况认真贯彻执行。
    我国的私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造运动，从今年1月份以来，波澜壮阔，突飞猛进。截至1月27日止，全国已有118个大中城市和193个县的私营工商业全部被批准实行公私合营，这些地区的手工业也全部被批准实行合作化。运动的发展基本上是健康的。但是，批准私营工商业实行全行业的公私合营和批准手工业全部实行合作化，并不等于社会主义改造工作已经完成，而只是进一步深入改造的开始。私营工商业被批准公私合营以后，还有清产核资、经济改组、企业改造、生产安排和人事安排等等一系列的工作要继续进行。个体手工业全部实行合作化以后，也还需要根据手工业各行各业不同的情况和特点，全面规划，妥善地进行改组和改造工作。这些工作都十分复杂，要完成这些工作，必须有相当的时间。
    但是，无论工商企业或手工业，首先都必须努力提高当前的生产和经营的水平。因为国家对于私营工商业和手工业进行社会主义改造的目的，归根到底是为了造成新的更高的劳动生产率和经营水平，以适应我国现阶段国民经济发展的要求，更好地满足我国人民不断增长着的多方面的需要。所以，我们在进行对于私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造工作中，就必须使新组成的公私合营企业和手工业生产合作社，更好地满足人民的需要，不仅不应当比过去做得差，而且应当比过去做得更好。
    为了这个目的，在对私营工商业和手工业进行改造的时候，应该特别注意的是不要轻易地去改变它们原来的生产和运销规律、经营制度和服务制度等等。我们知道，行业是一种自然形成的经济形式，每个行业都有它自己的历史特点，行业中的各个环节又有它内在的联系。前一个时期我们主要是忙于进行全行业公私合营和合作化的工作，还来不及对私营工商业和手工业的行业情况、生产和运销规律、经营制度等进行全面的考察研究，因此我们完全不应该急于改变原有的生产和经营制度；只有等到将来我们对生产技术和管理办法分析研究清楚以后，才能对行业中不合理的部分逐步加以改革。至于某些行业中存在的某些显然不合理的情况和困难问题，为了便利于生产和经营，经过领导机关的批准，当然也应该及时加以调整和解决。已经有充分的准备，已经作了详细考察研究，并且提出了统盘改组方案的行业，经过省（自治区）、市领导机关的批准，也可以进行改组。但是，这些只能是个别的有重点的。总之，经济改组、调整商业网、企业改造等工作，不能采用群众运动的方式予以解决，而必须经过一定时间的考察和研究，进行统盘规划，做好充分准备，在中央和地方统一领导和安排之下，有计划有步骤地逐行逐业地进行。只有这样，才能保证社会主义改造工作继续健康地向前发展，达到提高生产和经营水平、满足广大人民需要的目的。
    必须指出，私营工商业和手工业过去在生产经营上，都有它们自己的专长和独特的一面，有的因为某些产品质量好，或者有独特的风味，受到人民群众的欢迎和爱好；有的因为某些品种规格与众不同，吸引着一部分顾客。如果在公私合营和合作化以后，不去注意保存它们原来的这些特点和技术，就很容易降低质量和减少品种花色。原来私营工商业和手工业的生产技术和管理办法，虽然有不少是不合理的，是必须改变的；但也有不少好的，是应当予以保留甚至发扬的。搞社会主义决不是把所有的旧东西全盘否定，而是尽量接受其中好的、对人民有用的部分，使它们适应社会主义的要求。这当然就不是轻易改变原来的制度和办法所能够达到目的的。轻易改变原来的制度和办法只会把事情搞乱。
    会不会因为规定在半年左右时间内照旧生产和经营，以致锉伤群众的社会主义积极性呢？不，决不会是这样。我们进行社会主义改造既然是为了提高生产和经营的水平，决不是为了降低生产和经营水平，那末，现在暂时不动，稳一下，创造条件，将来不就可以动得更好吗？可见这个规定不是消极的而是积极的。应该看到，对原来私营工商业的经济改组和企业改造等一系列工作必须逐行逐业地进行，不可能一起动手，齐头并进。半年的时间是不多的，在半年之内做好这些工作是不算慢的。而目前工业、商业和手工业主管部门的任务，首先是要发动原来在私营工商业企业中的工人、店员、工程技术人员和手工业劳动者努力提高生产，积极改善服务工作的质量，把他们的社会主义积极性迅速引导到搞好当前的生产和经营方面去。
    国务院关于私营工商业批准公私合营以后在半年左右时间内照旧生产经营的规定，对工商业者来说，正是表示政府对他们的信任，同时也加重了他们的责任。许多工商业者在企业批准公私合营以后，热情高涨，努力生产，积极改善经营，这是好现象。但是目前也确实有一些工商业者存在着不同程度的等待和依赖思想，甚至把生产经营放下不管，这种态度应该纠正。工商界人士必须明确认识自己在公私合营企业中的责任，努力改进产品的规格和质量，增加花色品种，提高生产，改善经营，积极协助政府做好经济改组、企业改造的准备工作。在这些工作的过程中，处处有工商业者贡献力量的机会。我们号召所有工商业者用搞好当前生产和经营工作的实际行动，继续争取为社会主义事业作出更多的贡献。
