    The new Guiyang Cement Plant went into production on February 9th. This is the first modern factory in Guizhou Province, and over 90% of its production process is operated by machines. The cement produced by this plant will not only meet the needs of factory and mine infrastructure construction and highway construction in Guizhou Province, but also can supply the needs of farmland water conservancy projects and the Sichuan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Guangxi railway projects.

    贵阳水泥厂新建厂投入生产
    贵阳水泥厂新建厂在2月9日投入生产。这是贵州省第一座现代化的工厂，它的生产过程90％以上是用机器操作的。这个厂生产的水泥除供贵州省厂矿基本建设和公路建设需用外，还可以供应农田水利工程和川黔、黔桂铁路工程的需要。
