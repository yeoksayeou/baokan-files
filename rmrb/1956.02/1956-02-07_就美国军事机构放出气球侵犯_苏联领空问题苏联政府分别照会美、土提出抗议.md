Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, TASS dispatch: Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko received US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bohlen on February 4th and handed him the Soviet government's note regarding the release of balloons into Soviet airspace by US military institutions.

The note stated: In January of this year, a large number of balloons were intercepted in Soviet airspace, with various instruments, equipment, and other items suspended below. According to materials available to the Soviet government, these balloons were released by US military institutions from US Air Force bases in West German territory and in the territories of some countries bordering the Soviet Union. The instruments suspended below the balloons included automatic cameras for aerial photography of terrain and radio transceivers. In addition, US agencies continue to release balloons carrying anti-Soviet leaflets and propaganda books into Soviet airspace.

The note pointed out that as early as September 28, 1955, the Soviet government had already requested the US government to take necessary measures to stop US agencies from releasing balloons with objects from West German territory. However, the drifting of such balloons over Soviet territory has not only not stopped, but has recently increased.

The note stated: It is not difficult to understand what the situation would be if countries that discovered the above-mentioned balloons in their own airspace also began to release similar flying devices into the airspace of the countries that should be held responsible for the aforementioned illegal acts.

The note pointed out: The aforementioned actions of the US military authorities are a blatant violation of Soviet airspace and a violation of recognized principles of international law, according to which any flying device flying in the airspace of any country must be with the permission of the country concerned. Therefore, the aforementioned actions of the US military authorities are a violation of the inviolability of Soviet territory, a violation of the obligations undertaken by the US government under the United Nations Charter, and incompatible with normal relations between countries.

The Soviet government strongly protests and demands that the US government immediately stop the aforementioned actions of the US military authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, TASS dispatch: Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko received Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kavur on February 4th and handed him the Soviet government's note regarding the use of Turkish territory to send balloons into Soviet airspace.

The Soviet note stated that dozens of large balloons recently crossed the Soviet-Turkish border from the Turkish side and flew into Soviet territory and airspace. The results of the study of the balloons intercepted and discovered on Soviet territory showed that these balloons and the instruments attached to them were all manufactured in the United States.

The note pointed out: These balloons threaten the lives of passengers and crew on aircraft flying on domestic and international routes in the Soviet Union. According to materials available to the relevant Soviet authorities, these balloons were launched from Turkish territory.

The note stated that placing balloons into Soviet airspace harms the inviolability and sovereignty of Soviet territory, and grossly violates the recognized principles of international law fixed by the United Nations Charter. Since Turkish territory is being used to conduct such activities, the Turkish government cannot escape responsibility for these illegal actions.

The note stated that the Soviet government expects the Turkish government to take measures to stop using Turkish territory to release balloons into Soviet airspace.

    就美国军事机构放出气球侵犯
    苏联领空问题苏联政府分别照会美、土提出抗议
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　苏联外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯在2月4日接见了美国驻苏联大使波伦，并且把苏联政府关于美国军事机构放出气球到苏联领空的照会交给他。
    照会说：今年1月间，在苏联领空截获大量气球，气球下面悬挂着各种仪器、装备和其他东西。根据苏联政府现有的材料，这些气球是美国军事机构从西德领土以及同苏联接境的一些国家的领土上的美国空军基地放出的。气球下悬挂的仪器包括从空中拍摄地形的自动摄影机和无线电收、发报机等。此外，美国机构还继续向苏联领空放出装有敌视苏联的传单和宣传书籍的气球。
    照会指出，远在1955年9月28日，苏联政府就已经提请美国政府采取必要措施，使美国的机构停止从西德领土上放出带有物品的气球。但是这种气球在苏联领土上空的飘浮不仅没有停止，而且最近还多了起来。
    照会说：不难理解，如果在自己的领空发现了上述气球的国家也开始向那些应当对上述非法行为负责的国家的领空放出类似的飞行装置，那末情况将会怎样。
    照会指出：美国军事机关的上述行动是对苏联领空粗暴的侵犯，是对公认的国际法原则的破坏，根据国际法原则，任何飞行工具在任何国家领空飞行都必须经过当事国的许可。因此，美国军事机关的上述行动是对苏联领土不可侵犯性的破坏，是违背美国政府根据联合国宪章所承担的义务的，是同国与国之间正常的关系不相容的。
    苏联政府坚决抗议并且要求美国政府立即制止美国军事机关上述行动。
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　苏联外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯2月4日接见了土耳其驻苏联大使卡伏尔，把苏联政府就土耳其领土被利用来向苏联领空放送气球这一问题的照会交给他。
    苏联照会说，最近有几十个大气球从土耳其方面越过苏土边境飞入苏联的领土和领空。对于在苏联领土上截获和发现的气球所作的研究的结果表明，这些气球和挂在上面的仪器都是美国制造的。
    照会指出：这种气球威胁着在苏联国内航线以及国际航线上飞行的飞机上的旅客和乘务人员的生命。根据苏联有关机关现有的材料判断，这些气球是从土耳其境内放出的。
    照会说，向苏联领空放入气球，损害着苏联领土的不可侵犯权和主权，粗暴地破坏了为联合国宪章所固定下来的公认的国际法原则。既然土耳其领土被用来进行这种活动，土政府就不能不对这种非法行动负责。
    照会说，苏联政府期待土耳其政府采取措施，停止把土耳其领土用来向苏联领空放出气球。
