Comparing Cooperative Quality
Liu Fengxiang

    Lu Shan County in Henan Province has already achieved fully socialist agricultural cooperation. In order to consolidate all the agricultural production cooperatives in the county and ensure they carry out production in an orderly manner, the Lu Shan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of chairmen, branch secretaries, and chief accountants of agricultural production cooperatives in mid-January. The meeting summarized the achievements of establishing cooperatives and examined the new problems that arose after the agricultural production cooperatives were established. These problems were: First, through thorough ideological mobilization during the cooperative establishment period, the socialist consciousness of the vast number of members was greatly enhanced, and their enthusiasm for production soared to unprecedented heights. However, the leadership lagged behind the reality and the masses, and their understanding of the enormous potential of agricultural production cooperatives was insufficient, failing to meet the members' demands for production. Second, due to the short time since the establishment of the cooperatives, some specific issues had not been fully resolved. According to statistics, the private plots of land for members of 60 agricultural production cooperatives had not yet been specifically determined; the share funds of 101 agricultural production cooperatives had not been calculated clearly; and the processing of wheat seedlings from the various small cooperatives before the merger of 103 agricultural production cooperatives had not been statistically calculated. Third, the organization of most agricultural production cooperatives was not sound enough, and new financial systems had not yet been established, so that they could not adapt to the needs of production within the cooperative. On the other hand, cadres developed a sense of complacency, believing that once agricultural production cooperatives were established, all problems would be solved naturally, and they lacked sensitivity to the new problems that arose after the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. Some cadres also felt very distressed because they lacked experience in leading collective farmers to expand production.
    The meeting corrected the cadres' complacency and self-satisfaction and discussed several issues, such as labor management, financial management, and production organization in agricultural production cooperatives. Finally, it was decided to launch a quality comparison campaign throughout the county. The specific content is:
    Compare Production. All agricultural production cooperatives in the county must complete this winter's water conservancy construction plan before the Spring Festival, with the irrigated area reaching at least 70%; at the same time, a manure accumulation campaign of 10,000 jin per mu will be launched to ensure that the county achieves a 50% increase in production this year based on 1955. In addition, it is necessary to universally achieve livestock care and protection to ensure that all livestock safely survive the winter, and vigorously develop diversified economies and afforestation.
    Compare Love for the Cooperative. Conscientiously conduct political and ideological education and technical education for members, further establish the idea of taking the cooperative as their home among members, and mobilize members to invest in the cooperative according to current production needs to solve production difficulties within the cooperative; at the same time, educate members to fight against all bad elements who undermine agricultural production cooperatives.
    Compare Labor Management. Promote the "Five Fixed" contract labor system throughout the county, namely, fixed output, fixed quantity, fixed quality, fixed time, and fixed work; in terms of steps, first contract for summer harvest crops, and then contract for autumn harvest crops. The meeting decided that five agricultural production cooperatives should create experience in the contract output and overproduction reward system, and then promote it comprehensively.
    Compare Financial Management. In financial management, first, all the legacy issues from the establishment of the cooperative will be resolved, and a new financial management system will be established, gradually moving towards institutionalization.
    Compare Leadership. It mainly compares the enthusiasm, organizational soundness, and strong planning of leadership work, and gradually establishes a hierarchical and specialized management system for the leadership work of agricultural production cooperatives.
    In order to ensure the victory of the quality comparison campaign, the county party committee also established a contract management system based on the different scales and distribution of all agricultural production cooperatives in the county, that is, county party committee members were sent to agricultural production cooperatives with more than 3,000 households, district party committee secretaries were sent to agricultural production cooperatives with 1,000 to 2,000 households, district party committee members were sent to agricultural production cooperatives with 500 to 1,000 households, district cadres were sent to agricultural production cooperatives with 300 to 500 households, and the main cadres of the township were sent to agricultural production cooperatives with less than 300 households. A total of 7 county party committee members, 99 main district party committee members, 101 general district cadres, and 234 township cadres were sent to all agricultural production cooperatives to strengthen leadership; some cadres also had to serve as chairmen or branch secretaries of agricultural production cooperatives. This will ensure that this movement is carried out comprehensively under leadership.

    比办社质量
    刘凤翔
    河南省鲁山县已经实现了完全社会主义的农业合作化。中共鲁山县委为了把全县的农业生产合作社都巩固下来，都能有秩序地进行生产，在1月中旬召开了农业生产合作社主席、支部书记和总会计会议，总结建社的成绩，检查农业生产合作社建成以后带来的新问题。这些问题是：一、农业生产合作社经过建社时期充分的思想发动，广大社员的社会主义觉悟大大提高，生产积极性空前高涨。但是领导方面落后于实际，落后于群众，对农业生产合作社的巨大潜力认识不足，满足不了社员在生产上的要求。二、由于建社的时间短，有些具体问题还没有完全处理妥当。据统计，有60个农业生产合作社的社员的自留地还没有具体确定；101个农业生产合作社的股份基金还没有计算清楚；103个农业生产合作社合并以前各个小社的麦苗加工还没有统计计算。三、多数农业生产合作社的某些组织还不够健全，新的财务制度也还没有建立起来，以致不能适应社内生产的需要。而在另一方面，干部却产生了一种麻痹自满情绪，认为农业生产合作社一旦建成，什么问题都会自然而然地解决了，对农业生产合作社建成以后发生的新问题缺乏敏感。也有一部分干部由于缺乏领导集体农民扩大生产的经验，感到很苦闷。
    会议纠正了干部的自满麻痹思想，并且讨论了农业生产合作社的劳动管理、财务管理、组织生产等几个问题。最后决定在全县范围内开展一个比质量运动，具体内容是：
    比生产。全县所有农业生产合作社在春节前完成今年冬天的水利建设计划，浇地面积至少达到70％；同时开展一个每亩万斤肥料的积肥运动，以保证实现全县今年在1955年的基础上增产50％的指标。此外还要普遍做到爱畜保畜，保证所有牲畜安全过冬，以及大力发展多种经济和植树造林等。
    比爱社。切实对社员进行政治思想教育和技术教育，进一步树立社员以社为家的思想，发动社员根据当前生产需要向社内投资，解决社内生产上的困难；同时教育社员向一切破坏农业生产合作社的坏分子作斗争。
    比劳动管理。在全县推广五定包工制，即定产、定量、定质、定时、定工；在步骤上首先包好夏收作物，然后包秋收作物。会议确定五个农业生产合作社创造包工包产超产奖励制的经验，然后全面推广。
    比财务管理。在财务管理上首先将建社的遗留问题全部解决，并建立起新的财务管理制度，逐步走上制度化。
    比领导。主要是比领导工作上的积极热情、组织健全、计划性强，并使农业生产合作社的领导工作逐步建立分级分业管理制。
    为了保证比质量运动的胜利开展，县委又根据全县所有农业生产合作社的不同规模及分布情况，建立了包干管理制，即3，000户以上的农业生产合作社派了县委委员、1，000户至2，000户的农业生产合作社派了区委书记、500户至1，000户的农业生产合作社派了区委委员、300户至500户的农业生产合作社派了区干部、300户以下的农业生产合作社派了乡的主要干部。全县共派下县委7名，主要区委99名，一般区干部101名，乡干部234名，深入到所有农业生产合作社，加强领导；有的干部并且要担任农业生产合作社主席或支部书记。这就能够保证这一运动有领导地全面地开展起来。
