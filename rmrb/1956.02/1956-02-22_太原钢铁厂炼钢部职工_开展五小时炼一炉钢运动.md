Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Steelmaking Department Workers
	Launch Campaign to Smelt a Furnace of Steel in Five Hours
The workers of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's steelmaking department are launching a campaign to smelt a furnace of steel in five hours to ensure the early completion of the Five-Year Plan.
	From the first day of this year, the steelworkers began working selflessly to break the quotas, overfulfilling the production plan in January. Steel production increased by 35.6% compared to the same period last year, and the average smelting time per furnace was shortened to 5 hours and 51 minutes, 5 minutes shorter than planned. Among them, 41 furnaces of steel were smelted in 3 hours and 54 minutes to 5 hours. Based on this, advanced producers in the steelmaking department proposed launching a campaign to smelt a furnace of steel in 5 hours. According to the preliminary steps determined for the campaign to smelt a furnace of steel in 5 hours, this year's steel production plan has been increased by tens of thousands of tons, and the annual output will be 33.4% higher than last year's plan, and 17% higher than the national controlled 1957 production target.
	Currently, the vast majority of employees in the steelmaking department have actively participated in the campaign to smelt a furnace of steel in 5 hours. In the 10 days from February 8th to February 17th, the steelworkers have continuously created 15 new records for shortening smelting time and daily furnace output.

    太原钢铁厂炼钢部职工
    开展五小时炼一炉钢运动
    太原钢铁厂炼钢部职工正以开展5小时炼一炉钢的运动来保证提早完成五年计划。
    从今年的第一天起，炼钢工人们为突破定额就开始忘我地劳动，在1月份超额完成了产量计划，钢产量比去年同期提高了35.6％，每炉钢冶炼时间平均缩短到5小时51分，比计划缩短了5分钟，其中有41炉钢是用3小时54分到5小时的时间炼出来的。在这一基础上，炼钢部先进生产者就提出了开展5小时炼一炉钢运动的倡议。根据初步确定的开展5小时炼一炉钢运动的步骤，今年钢的产量计划又增加了数万吨，全年产量比去年计划将提高33.4％，比国家控制的1957年产量指标还要提高17％。
    目前炼钢部绝大多数职工都积极投入了5小时炼一炉钢的运动，2月8日到2月17日的10天中，炼钢工人又连续创造了15次缩短冶炼时间和炉的日产量的新纪录。
