Comrades Chairman and Members:

I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, the reports of Vice-Chairmen Dong Biwu, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, and Chen Shutong, and the report of Committee Member Chen Boda.

These reports have given me immense encouragement and unparalleled excitement. We see the strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, constantly growing and consolidating; we see the increasing isolation of the American aggressive bloc, which is increasingly unpopular. As Chairman Zhou Enlai said: "The current international situation is conducive to world peace, conducive to our socialist construction, and unfavorable to the war plans and aggressive policies of the aggressive bloc." Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our socialist revolution is surging forward to a new high tide, enabling the entire national economy and scientific, cultural, educational, health, and other undertakings to develop or are developing rapidly. As Chairman Mao said: "In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed throughout the country." Encouraged by this new situation, I, like everyone else, am full of confidence to accelerate towards socialism. I must do a good job in the united front work of the local CPPCC and my own professional work, and contribute all my strength to the great cause of socialist construction.

The Qingdao Municipal Local CPPCC, under the leadership of the local Party committee and the guidance of the higher-level CPPCC, has done some work in accordance with the seven principles of the CPPCC and the five tasks instructed by Chairman Mao. In order to maintain close contact with people from all walks of life, we have launched various activities in conjunction with the central task, and listened to the opinions from all sides in a timely manner, so as to communicate policies and ideas, and strengthen unity and progress. We have established eight professional groups. Through the activities of the various professional groups, we extensively and regularly absorb representative people from all walks of life to participate in the work, which plays a certain role in assisting the government in implementing various policies, completing the central tasks of each period, and supporting the development of the work of state organs and business departments. At the same time, we regularly organize representatives from all walks of life to study current affairs policies and theories, and assist the study committees of industry and commerce, medical services, women, and religious circles in formulating study plans, organizing study reports, issuing study documents, and holding question-and-answer sessions, which vigorously promote the widespread development of study activities among people from all walks of life. In addition, we also organize people from all walks of life to visit and conduct various forms of image education, which has a certain effect on raising socialist awareness and enhancing confidence in socialist construction. Judging from the study groups organized by the Municipal CPPCC, they can generally adhere to the study system on a voluntary basis, and they have generally been able to carry out criticism and self-criticism in combination with reality in study discussions. This shows the urgent need of people from all walks of life to study Marxism-Leninism theory and carry out ideological transformation.

However, we have not done enough work on intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals. This is mainly because we do not have a sufficient understanding of the vigorous development of socialist cause and the significant role of intellectuals in the socialist construction cause; at the same time, we are afraid of affecting their professional work, so the CPPCC absorbs them to participate in various political and social activities less often, and even if there are, they are concentrated on a few people. This makes a few people feel overburdened, seriously affecting their professional work; while most people do not have the opportunity to participate in the necessary political and social activities, cannot broaden their horizons and enrich their lives in the practice of social life, and feel dissatisfied. Today, the country has entered a climax of socialist revolution, and it is necessary to give full play to the important role of the vast number of intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, in the cause of socialist construction. This conference's emphasis on the issue of intellectuals is very necessary and timely. Chairman Zhou Enlai and Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo both mentioned that the current strength of intellectuals in our country, whether in terms of quantity, professional level, or political consciousness, cannot meet the needs of the rapid development of the socialist cause. In order to enable intellectuals to play a greater role in the cause of socialist construction, the Qingdao Municipal Local CPPCC will strengthen its work on intellectuals under the leadership of the local Party committee and the guidance of the higher-level CPPCC in the future. On the premise of ensuring that they spend six-fifths of their time on professional work each week, they should be widely and systematically absorbed to participate in various necessary political and social activities. When intellectuals take self-education under the leadership of the Party, through observation and practice of social life, practice of business, and study of Marxist-Leninist theory, the local CPPCC should give them great help in these three interconnected ways, especially should take on the task of organizing intellectuals to participate in the observation and practice of social life, so that every intellectual has the opportunity to participate in political and social activities and visits, so as to enhance their confidence in socialist construction and further exert their strength.

Today, while the country and the people of the whole country urgently demand that intellectuals give full play to their strength and actively participate in socialist construction, they also bring new tasks to the local CPPCC. I believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we are full of confidence and we will certainly be able to complete the task. Let us all work together to build our country into a great socialist country.

    陈仰之的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，董必武、李济深、郭沫若、陈叔通各位副主席的各项报告和陈伯达委员的报告。
    这些报告，给我莫大的鼓舞和无比的兴奋。我们看到以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量，不断地壮大和巩固；我们看到美国侵略集团的日益孤立，日益不得人心，正如周恩来主席说的：“目前的国际形势是有利于世界和平，有利于我们的社会主义建设，不利于侵略集团的战争计划和侵略政策的。”我们的社会主义革命在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，以排山倒海之势推向了新的高潮，使整个国民经济和科学、文化、教育、卫生等事业有了或正在迅速的发展。正如毛主席说的：“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。”在这新的形势的鼓舞下，我和大家一样满怀信心地要加速向社会主义迈进。我一定要做好地方政协的统一战线工作和自身的业务工作，在伟大的社会主义建设事业中，贡献自己的一切力量。
    青岛市地方政协在当地党委的领导和上级政协的指导下，根据政协的七项准则和毛主席指示的五项任务，做了一些工作。我们为了经常地与各方面人士取得密切联系，结合中心工作展开各种活动，及时的听取各方面的反映意见，以便沟通政策思想，加强团结进步，建立了八个专业小组。通过各个专业小组的活动，广泛地、经常地吸收各方面有代表性的人士参加工作，这对协助政府贯彻各项政策，完成每一时期的中心任务，支持国家机关业务部门工作的开展起了一定的作用。同时我们经常地组织各方面的代表人士进行时事政策和理论学习，并协助工商、医务、妇女及宗教界的学习委员会，制定学习计划、组织学习报告、印发学习文件、举办解答报告会等，有力地推动各界人士广泛地开展了学习活动。除此之外，并且组织各界人士参观，进行各种形象教育，这对于提高社会主义觉悟，增强社会主义建设的信心，是有一定效果的。从本市政协组织的学习组来看，一般都能做到在自愿的基础上坚持学习制度，并且在学习讨论中一般已经能够结合实际展开批评和自我批评。这说明各界人士对学习马克思列宁主义理论、进行思想改造的迫切要求。
    但我们对知识分子特别是高级知识分子的工作，做得非常不够。主要是由于我们对社会主义事业的蓬勃发展、对知识分子在社会主义建设事业中的重大作用认识不足；同时，又由于怕影响他们的业务工作，因而政协吸收他们参加各种政治和社会活动较少，就是有，也是集中在少数人身上。这样使少数人感到负担过重，严重地影响了他们的业务；而多数人却得不到参加必要的政治和社会活动的机会，不能在社会生活的实践中扩大眼界，充实生活内容，而感到不满。今天国家已经进入了社会主义革命的高潮，需要充分发挥广大的知识分子特别是高级知识分子在社会主义建设事业中的重大作用。这次会议把关于知识分子的问题着重的提出来是非常必要的、及时的。周恩来主席和郭沫若副主席的报告都提到：我国知识分子的现有力量，无论在数量方面、在业务水平方面、在政治觉悟方面，都还不能适应社会主义事业急速发展的需要。为了使知识分子在社会主义建设事业中能够发挥更大的力量，青岛市地方政协今后在当地党委的领导和上级政协的指导下，要加强对知识分子的工作。在保证他们每周六分之五的时间搞业务的前提下，要广泛地有计划地吸收他们参加各种必要的政治社会活动。当知识分子在党的领导下采取自我教育、通过社会生活的观察和实践、业务的实践和马克思列宁主义理论学习这样三个互相联系的途径中，地方政协是应该给他们大力帮助，尤其应该担负起组织知识分子参加社会生活的观察和实践的任务，使每一个知识分子都有参加政治社会活动和参观的机会，以增强他们对社会主义建设的信心，进一步发挥他们的力量。
    今天国家和全国人民迫切地要求知识分子充分发挥力量、积极参加社会主义建设的同时，也带给了地方政协新的任务。我相信在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们是满怀信心的一定可以完成任务。我们大家共同努力，为把我国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
