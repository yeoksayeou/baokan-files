    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Indonesian Trade Union Federation, the Free German Trade Union Federation, the General Confederation of Labor of France, and the Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor have all protested the Austrian government's decision to prohibit the leadership institutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions from operating in Austria.
    In a telegram to the Austrian President and Prime Minister, the Indonesian Trade Union Federation pointed out that the Austrian government's decision, taken under the control of American warmongers, is an anti-democratic decision against the more than 80 million members of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Indonesian Trade Union Federation demanded that the Austrian government immediately revoke it.
    In a telegram to the Austrian Federal Government, the National Executive Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation pointed out that the United Nations Charter recognizes the World Federation of Trade Unions as an international organization of the working class, and the Austrian Ministry of Interior's opposition to the World Federation of Trade Unions violates the principle of neutrality it adopted under the State Treaty.
    A statement from the General Confederation of Labor of France said that this decision is an intolerable infringement on the freedom of trade union activities and the rights of working people.

    抗议奥地利政府禁止世界工联活动
    据新华社讯　印度尼西亚总工会、自由德国工会联合会、法国总工会和意大利总工会书记处分别表示抗议奥地利政府禁止世界工会联合会领导机构在奥地利活动的决定。
    印度尼西亚总工会在发给奥地利总统和总理的电报中指出，奥地利政府的这个决定是在美国战争贩子控制下采取的反对世界工联8，000多万会员的反民主的决定。印度尼西亚总工会要求奥地利政府立即撤销它。
    自由德国工会联合会全国执行委员会在给奥地利联邦政府的电报中指出，联合国宪章承认世界工联是工人阶级的国际组织，奥地利内政部反对世界工联的行为违背了它根据国家条约所采取的中立地位的原则。
    法国总工会的声明说，这个决定是对工会活动自由和劳动人民权利的不可容忍的侵犯。
