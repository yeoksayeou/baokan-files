In Deyang County, Sichuan Province, most townships have implemented a method of holding regular "Co-op Director Joint Meetings" to arrange the work of managing agricultural cooperatives. However, in many townships, these "Co-op Director Joint Meetings" are always held without preparation, the meeting content is too numerous, they fail to grasp the central issues, and the results are not significant.

In order to enable the "Co-op Director Joint Meetings" to play a better role, the Deyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to start improving them in four aspects: 1. Each township branch should formulate a relatively long-term plan for the meeting content, and then make short-term arrangements based on priority and urgency; 2. Each township branch should focus on key cooperatives, discover problems, summarize experiences, and disseminate them at the joint meetings; 3. Each joint meeting should focus on solving a major problem in business management related to current production; 4. The branch should grasp the specific details of the main issues in advance; 5. Each meeting should clearly deploy the work for the next stage.

These opinions, after being discussed by all township branch secretaries and agricultural cooperative directors in the county, were unanimously agreed upon and it was decided to implement them.

    改进“社主任接头会”
    四川省德阳县大部分乡推行了定期举行“社主任接头会”的办法，安排管理农业合作社的工作。但是，有许多乡的“社主任接头会”总是会前无准备，开会内容繁多，抓不住中心问题，成效不大。
    中共德阳县委为了使“社主任接头会”能更好地发挥作用，决定从四个方面着手改进：1．各乡支部对会议内容定出比较长时期的计划，然后分别主次缓急作出短安排；2．各乡支部抓住重点社，发现问题，总结经验，在接头会上传播；3．每次接头会要围绕当前生产解决经营管理中的一个主要问题；4．支部事先要掌握主要问题的具体情况；5．每次会议要明确地布置下一段工作。
    这些意见，经过全县各乡支部书记，农业合作社社长讨论以后，一致同意，决定贯彻执行。
