Comrades! In the Central Committee's summary report, Comrade Khrushchev summarized the work of our Party during the period between the 19th and 20th National Congresses.

The report provided a profound analysis of the domestic and international situation of the Soviet Union, clarified some of the most important issues in the theory and practice of communist construction, and pointed out the path for further developing our country's economy and improving the material and cultural living standards of our people.

The figures listed in the report reflect the tremendous achievements our Party has made in solving the urgent tasks of communist construction and in the struggle to consolidate international peace, security, and friendship.

I don't need to list again the figures that can clearly demonstrate the achievements made in developing our country's economy in recent years, nor do I need to cite materials that can illustrate our Party's tireless concern for improving the living conditions of our residents. Comrade Khrushchev's report has already listed these materials in great detail.

In the summary period, the Central Committee paid great attention to further developing the national economy, developing industry and overcoming the backwardness in agriculture, and improving services to residents.

The measures taken by the Party in developing the economy during the summary period are known to everyone.

After a comprehensive study of the good experiences and shortcomings in industrial work, the Central Committee formulated and adopted some measures at the July 1955 plenary session: adopting the latest technology in various industrial sectors, comprehensively implementing mechanization, and better organizing production; in order to greatly improve labor productivity, reduce product costs, and improve product quality on this basis.

The measures taken by the Party in further developing industry and raising it to a new and higher technical level are specifically reflected in the draft directives of the 20th Party Congress on the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

In agriculture, the Central Committee exposed the roots of some serious backwardness in agricultural sectors, especially in sectors like grain and livestock production, and is now implementing some measures to rapidly develop the entire agriculture.

We are pleased to see that since the implementation of these agricultural measures, preliminary achievements have been made.

The pledges made by collective farm members in many districts and states to complete the Party's plan to increase agricultural production ahead of schedule have been universally approved by the Party and the people. We have sufficient reason to hope that the tasks of developing agriculture stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan can be completed in a period much shorter than the period predicted in the draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. To achieve this, the advanced experience of collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations must be accepted by all agricultural workers, and leading staff and experts must make every effort to help promote advanced experience to all collective farms and state farms.

We all know what role construction plays in our country. In 1956, the state funds used for capital construction exceeded 160 billion rubles, while the total investment in capital construction during the entire Sixth Five-Year Plan period was 990 billion rubles.

The Central Committee came to the correct conclusion that only by putting construction projects on a factory-like track, widely mechanizing construction projects, implementing standard designs, and adopting the most advanced construction methods can we ensure the necessary scale and rapid speed of construction projects. With the personal participation of builders—workers, engineers, and technicians—vast possibilities for reducing the cost of construction projects were found.

After studying some problems in construction work, the Party Central Committee formulated a specific plan for this sector of the national economy.

Comrades! We can clearly imagine that if the imperialist countries had not inflicted huge losses on us, we could have made more achievements in developing the economy and culture of our motherland in the years after the establishment of the Soviet regime, and we would already be able to feel all the benefits of our socialist system. The imperialist countries have tried everything possible to eliminate the first country where socialism has triumphed.

Interventionists, White Guard elements, and Hitler's invaders ravaged our motherland and caused it to suffer heavy destruction. They intended to strangle us with hunger and economic blockade. Under the leadership of our glorious Party, the Soviet people, after seizing power, had to engage in the most brutal wars for survival and independence, and even after driving out the enemy, they still had to constantly maintain full armament, and therefore had to spend a considerable amount of money on national defense in order not to be caught off guard.

All this has made our development difficult and hindered. Later, the heroic struggle of the Soviet people, their selfless labor, their organizational skills, and their tenacious spirit disrupted the wishful thinking of the imperialist elements and elevated our socialist country to the position of one of the strongest countries in the world.

We also understand that the achievement of all our successes is largely due to the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the entire people being good at utilizing all the possibilities and advantages of the socialist system.

At present, when the socialist system is playing a victorious role and has practically proven its superiority over capitalism, the most important work of our ruling party is to formulate steps that can comprehensively improve our system, eliminate shortcomings and errors in individual links, drive the backward sectors, and thus promote the cause of communist construction.

I believe that the activities of the Party in the period after the 19th Party Congress should be measured by such a yardstick. It should be said that the Central Committee has done a lot of work to discover the potential for further improving our economy, correctly formulated the task of how to utilize this potential, and made every effort to fight for the realization of these tasks.

In the summary report to the Congress, Comrade Khrushchev exposed many major shortcomings with a Bolshevik frankness, and the elimination of these shortcomings is a necessary condition for the victorious realization of the Party's plan for communist construction.

This report paid special attention to the need to increase labor productivity, because this is the decisive condition for the victorious realization of our plan, we must adopt new and advanced technologies and master these technologies, practice economy in all aspects, and we should take a caring attitude towards material wealth. The huge potential of our economy should be fully utilized.

In the leading work of the Party, the Soviets, and the economy, we should, as the Central Committee requires, resolutely abandon the formalistic and aloof bureaucratic leadership methods, rely more widely on the experience of advanced workers, collective farm members, and experts, and strengthen flexible organizational work among the masses by all means.

Our achievements in economic and cultural construction, the achievements in striving for peace and friendship among all peoples, the new tasks of building communism put forward by Comrade Khrushchev in the Central Committee's summary report, and the ways and means to solve these tasks, all this not only inspires the Communist Party members, but also inspires every Soviet citizen and all our friends in the world.

At present, the most important thing is to energetically, tenaciously, and persistently realize the plan of communist construction.

Comrades! In all the activities carried out during the period of the summary report, the Central Committee firmly and thoroughly implemented the principle of Lenin's collective leadership.

In the future, we should constantly consolidate this principle of Lenin's collective leadership in our work, because only in this way can we prevent possible mistakes and unite the broad masses of working people around the Party.

Our Party is the vanguard of the people, it enjoys the unlimited trust and support of the people. The Communist Party, the Soviet state, and all our people are a united, invincible, and powerful force. Under the leadership of its own Communist Party, the Soviet people will resolutely move towards new victories in communist construction in the future. (Prolonged applause)

Comrades! We are in an era where the process of establishing a new and advanced socio-political system, unprecedented in history, is taking place in the world. In addition to the Soviet Union, the people of many countries, accounting for one-third of the world's population, have firmly embarked on the road of building socialism and are making rapid progress on this road. Hundreds of millions of people in Asian and African countries have awakened and are standing up. They are destroying the old colonial system edifice, destroying this evil monument, this prison of the people, establishing national states and actively participating in socio-political life.

All kinds of imperialist elements not long ago were cruelly exploiting the Chinese people and massacring unsubmissive Chinese patriots. Now, the great People's Republic of China is a powerful fortress of freedom and independence, peace and friendship for all ethnic groups in the East, and a new and constantly developing socialist construction project on an unprecedented scale. (Prolonged applause)

It was also not long ago that the colonialists were cruelly and ruthlessly exploiting the Indian people, stifling their slightest manifestations of love of freedom, and driving Indian soldiers to wars against their will. Now, the Republic of India is moving forward as a great and independent country, becoming a defender of peace and friendship between all peoples. (Applause)

The struggle against foreign oppression and the serious consequences caused by this oppression has swept across Asian and African countries and is beginning to spread to Latin American countries.

All this means that the era of foreign rule over backward countries is coming to an end once and for all. The era of national rejuvenation of the oppressed countries and complete liberation from the shackles of colonialism has arrived.

The awakened people of Asia and Africa are actively participating in the struggle for peace. In this way, the front of warriors fighting for the great cause of peace has expanded immeasurably. Together with the people of the Soviet Union, China, and all people's democratic countries, the people of India, Burma, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Egypt, Syria, and other countries are advancing in the ranks of peace warriors with firm steps.

The Soviet Union, together with the People's Republic of China and all people's democratic countries, has always been the leading force for the peace, freedom, independence, and happiness of all mankind, both in the past and now. (Applause)

The reason why Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev achieved great success in their visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan is also that they expressed the thoughts, feelings, and emotions felt by the people of Eastern countries in their speeches to the working masses of these countries. The people of Asian countries believe that the Soviet representatives are indomitable warriors for peace, national independence, and the bright future of all peoples. They saw that the Soviet Union is prepared to expand economic and cultural ties with them on an equal footing, without requiring others to accept military blocs or other conditions, and without interfering in internal affairs. (Applause)

In the summary report of the Central Committee, Comrade Khrushchev made an important theoretical generalization on three extremely important issues in the development of the modern international situation based on Marxist analysis. These three issues are the peaceful coexistence of two systems, the possibility of preventing war in the current era, and the forms of transition to socialism in various countries. The theoretical exploration of these issues is an outstanding example of the creative application of Marxism-Leninism.

The correct solution of these issues based on Marxism-Leninism has significant political significance, because these issues are related to the fate of the people of all countries in the world, and the correct answers to these issues arm all the warriors who are fighting for peace and friendship among all peoples, for national independence and a bright future.

The peaceful coexistence of two different systems is not a temporary tactical application, but a principle of Soviet foreign policy formulated by Lenin. Our Party and the Soviet state have consistently adhered to this principle since the founding of the country.

Based on the principled stance of peaceful coexistence between the two systems and the possibility of preventing war under the current development conditions, the Communist Party and the Soviet state have consistently and firmly implemented a policy of peace and friendship between all peoples.

The diplomatic activities we have taken in 1955 alone can convincingly illustrate this point.

As everyone knows, our government submitted specific proposals for reducing armed forces and prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons to the United Nations for discussion as early as May 10, 1955. We have also set an example in actually implementing some measures to reduce armaments in this regard, reducing the Soviet armed forces by 640,000 people, reducing defense expenditures by nearly 10 billion rubles in the 1956 budget, and abolishing the naval bases in Lushunkou and the Pokala Peninsula.

The Soviet Union showed initiative in concluding a state treaty with Austria and withdrew its troops from this country. The Soviet government established diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, signed a state relations treaty with the German Democratic Republic, and submitted proposals to the Western countries for discussion on withdrawing the four-nation troops from Germany.

Due to the initiative of the Soviet Union, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia were restored, and these relations had been abnormal for a long time.

Our country has made considerable efforts to ensure the success of the Geneva four-nation government summit. The results of this meeting have eased international tensions.

In order to strengthen mutual understanding between the people of all countries and to ease international tensions, 16 countries were admitted to the United Nations through the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union.

In order to ease international tensions, build mutual trust, and consolidate world peace, the highest institutions of the Communist Party and the Soviet state have done a lot of work in developing contacts between leaders of the Soviet Union and other countries.

The mutual exchange of parliamentary delegations is of great significance for realizing our peace policy. The declaration adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union last February called for the establishment of contacts between parliaments of all countries, and this declaration received a good response from many countries in the world.

As we all know, parliamentary delegations from India, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Yugoslavia, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Belgium, Albania, Syria, Luxembourg, Poland ,Iran, Bulgaria have visited our country.

The Supreme Soviet delegation of the Soviet Union has also visited Finland, Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary and the German Democratic Republic

Furthermore, members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have also joined the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which includes the parliaments of more than 40 different countries.

The visits to the Soviet Union by parliamentary delegations from many countries and the visits abroad by delegations from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have fully proven to be effective and have played an important role in improving relations between countries.

Thanks to the active peace policy of the Soviet Union, the international atmosphere has improved, the people of all countries have begun to breathe a sigh of relief, and the diplomatic status of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist democratic camp and the status of all warriors striving for world peace have been strengthened.

We are fighting for peace, not because our country is weak. The Soviet Union is a powerful country with all the necessary possibilities to give any aggressor a devastating counterattack. We maintain peace because we know how huge sacrifices and destruction modern warfare will bring.

Military leaders—our former allies in World War II—also know about this. It would be good if they could draw corresponding conclusions for their policies from their own understanding. (Applause)

Of course, under no circumstances can we be complacent because of the achievements we have made. Unfortunately, enemies of peace still exist, they continue to expand their armaments for the enrichment of monopoly capital, and are now attempting, and will continue to attempt, to provoke new wars. Therefore, the struggle of the people of all countries for peace is an extremely important international task, and the victorious resolution of this task is not only closely related to the interests of the Soviet working people, but also to the interests of the people of all countries in the world without exception.

Comrades! The major tasks facing our country require further strengthening of the Soviet state and strengthening socialist legality in the activities of all aspects of state organs.

The realization of the communist construction plan put forward by Comrade Khrushchev in the summary report of the Central Committee is closely related to maximizing the creative initiative of the working people, to more widely attracting them to participate in the management of state affairs, and to further developing Soviet socialist democracy.

In the 38 years since the establishment of the Soviet state, the Soviets of Working People's Deputies have been tempered and grown stronger, and they have become the real organs of people's power that constitute the unbreakable political foundation of the Soviet state system.

The unwavering enthusiasm of the people in the election campaign and the almost universal participation of voters in voting when electing representatives to the central and local organs of power prove the great strength of the Soviets. The fact that millions of Soviet citizens voluntarily participate in the multifaceted activities of the Soviets also illustrates this point.

Under these conditions, the shortcomings existing in the work of the Soviets pointed out in the summary report are even more intolerable. But, unfortunately, there are still quite a few of these shortcomings.

Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that some Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics and Autonomous Republics did not convene meetings according to the time limits stipulated in the Constitution. In fact, some Union Republics held only one Supreme Soviet meeting last year, while the Constitution stipulates two.

This is not only a formal violation of the Constitution. Comrades, it must be noted that in places where the Soviet meetings are not held within the stipulated time limits, the Soviets will inevitably lose their leading role over the executive organs responsible to them, and the result is, and cannot but be, a disruption of the principles of Soviet democracy. Only by convening meetings regularly can the Soviets promptly solve the tasks of economic and cultural construction and ensure that representatives actively participate in the management of state affairs. It is worth noting that it is precisely in those places where the Soviets do not convene meetings regularly that the bureaucratic style of work takes root, the connection with the masses is lost, bureaucracy develops, and the work gets worse and worse.

Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in the Central Committee's summary report that the Soviets should focus their attention on the specific issues of economic and cultural construction and frequently raise these issues for discussion at meetings.

Unfortunately, it is still not enough to raise specific and urgent important issues at the Soviet meetings, and boastful speeches and declarative resolutions often replace practical discussions.

It goes without saying that only when specific issues are raised at the Soviet meetings, when representatives actively participate in the preparation and discussion of issues, when shortcomings are criticized seriously, and when creative initiative is encouraged in many ways, only then can the resolutions of the Soviets and their executive committees have practical force, and only then can we ensure the victorious realization of these resolutions.

The strength of the Soviets lies in its indivisible connection with the masses. If it is separated from the masses and does not absorb the broad activists to participate in the work, the Soviet cannot fulfill the tasks it undertakes.

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin taught us that the Soviet is "a regime that opens its doors to all, does everything in front of the masses, facilitates the access of the masses, and comes directly from the masses. It is the direct and uninterrupted organ of the masses of the people and the will of the masses of the people."

There are more than 1.5 million representatives in the local Soviets throughout the Soviet Union, of whom 35.6% have received higher and secondary education. According to occupation, there are more than 37,000 engineers and secondary technical personnel among the representatives, about 50,000 agronomists, zoologists and other agricultural experts, 122,000 elementary and secondary school teachers, and 46,000 doctors, assistant doctors and other medical personnel. Among the representatives are leaders of enterprises, state farm directors and machine tractor station directors, collective farm chairmen, livestock farm directors, as well as advanced workers and collective farmers.

Work must be carried out in such a way that this large army of advanced workers in our country actively participates in the work of the Soviets, so that the state organs of the Soviet Union have a more solid connection with the broad masses of working people.

The system of representatives reporting to voters is of great significance for strengthening the connection between the Soviets and the residents. This is one of the most important requirements stipulated in the Constitution, but unfortunately, this requirement has not been fulfilled in many cases. Some representatives of the local Soviets have not reported their work and the work of the Soviets to the voters.

The Party has instructed us to ensure that representatives maintain regular contact with the voters, report to the voters regularly, explain the resolutions passed by the Soviets to the residents, and actively participate in the realization of these resolutions.

Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in the report that we have not always dismissed those representatives who have betrayed the trust of the voters in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. This is to some extent because we have not yet formulated a method for dismissing representatives. As for the method of dismissing representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the relevant bill has been drafted and will be submitted to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for approval, and all representatives must firmly remember this. (Laughter, applause)

The Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics and Autonomous Republics should also pass laws on dismissing representatives of the Supreme Soviets of the Republics and representatives of the local Soviets.

Measures must be taken to strengthen the activities of the highest state power organs of the Union Republics and Autonomous Republics. More issues related to the economic and cultural construction of the Republics should be raised at the meetings of the Supreme Soviets of the Republics, such as national economic plans, national education, health care, public utilities, road construction, improvement of settlements, etc.

Studying these issues at the meetings of the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics and Autonomous Republics, allowing local staff to actively participate in the discussion of these issues, will greatly help to satisfactorily solve the increasingly complex tasks in economic and cultural construction and to improve the sense of responsibility of the Soviet leaders in implementing the instructions of the Party and the government.

Comrade Khrushchev proposed to establish an economic committee in the Nationalities Chamber of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to be responsible for studying practical issues related to the development of the economy of the Union Republics and to draft well-considered draft resolutions on these issues. This proposal is completely correct and timely.

The establishment of such a committee in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will be of great significance for implementing the Party's measures to further improve the economy and culture of the national republics of our country.

Comrades, it is now necessary to talk about some issues of legislation and socialist legality.

Soviet legislation has always been one of the important factors in mobilizing the Soviet people to complete the tasks proposed by the Communist Party to the country. In this sense, the creative power and mobilizing power of Soviet legislation can be explained.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will soon pass many important decrees.

Comrade Khrushchev said in his report to the Congress that the draft law on a unified pension system for the entire Soviet Union will soon be submitted to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for approval. This decree will fundamentally improve the work on pensions.

In addition, the Central Committee of the Party also plans to implement many important measures to further improve the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people. Among these measures include the task of ensuring the increase of the actual wages of workers and staff, implementing a 7-hour working day, and implementing a 6-hour working day without reducing wages for workers in certain industries.

Due to the solution of these major tasks, the issue of revising and rectifying the labor law will be raised. The reason why this is necessary is also because the current labor laws of the Union Republics were passed many years ago, and although many supplements have been made later, they still cannot reflect the socio-economic changes that have occurred in our country during this period.

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union must take all the measures it can take in order to accelerate the drafting of the decrees stipulated in the Constitution of the Soviet Union. These decrees will greatly rectify our legislation and will be an important means of further consolidating socialist legality.

New draft criminal law and procedural law have now been drafted, and the implementation of these two laws will play a major role in consolidating socialist legality and ensuring the protection of citizens' rights.

Comrades! The Central Committee of the Party pays great attention to consolidating socialist legality. As a result of the measures taken, the supervisory rights of the prosecutor have been fully restored and strengthened.

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, under the direction of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, approved the new Regulations on Supervision by Prosecutors of the Soviet Union. The regulations, formulated in accordance with Lenin's instructions on the role and tasks of the Soviet procuratorial organs, are a precise program of activities for the procuratorial organs. The task placed before them is to become principled organs with an irreconcilable spirit of struggle in the struggle to ensure that all organs, public officials and citizens of the Soviet Union strictly abide by the law.

In order to realize the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party on strengthening socialist legality, in addition to administrative measures, it is also necessary to carry out huge and meticulous work in educating our cadres, in widely publicizing Soviet laws among all residents, and in the necessity for all citizens to strictly abide by the law. We should enable our cadres—cadres of the Party, Soviets, economy, and trade unions—to correctly understand the law and impartially apply the law from top to bottom. Our press should play a major role in the struggle to safeguard socialist legality, and it should and can do a lot of work.

The interests of consolidating socialist legality urgently require improving the work of our state organs in reviewing citizens' petitions and complaints. In their petitions, the working people not only ask for help in something, but often point out the shortcomings in the work of the Soviet organs and put forward valuable suggestions for improving the work of factories, collective farms, state farms, and our organs.

The results of inspections of many local Soviet executive committees and certain ministries have proven that serious shortcomings exist in this major state work. In some organs, the legal regulations on the time limit for reviewing complaints have been violated, there is a lack of inspection on the handling of petitions and on the decisions taken on applications, and the replies to the petitioners are often formal replies. This indifference and carelessness towards the petitions and complaints of the working people undermines the prestige of the Soviet organs.

It is necessary to resolutely eradicate the bureaucratic attitude towards the petitions of the working people and to improve the work of reviewing and satisfying the legitimate demands of the petitioners.

In order to eliminate the roots that cause the working people to file countless petitions and reasonable complaints, we should focus our main attention on these aspects: improving the work of the Soviet organs, enterprises, collective farms, and social organizations, making the work of the Soviet state organs impeccable, making all its resolutions based on the law, and making the Soviet staff careful and honest in treating their duties, taking into account the interests and needs of the working people in their work.

Comrades! Our Party and country are carrying out huge and multifaceted work in cultivating the Soviet people into conscious builders of communism. As a result of this work, the political and labor enthusiasm of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, their organizational skills, and their discipline are constantly improving.

We are also doing a lot of work in cultivating the younger generation. Soviet youth are growing up to be people who are healthy in body and mind, and who are infinitely loyal to their glorious motherland and the Communist Party. Our youth are working in industry, agriculture, transportation, and various organs with fighting enthusiasm and indomitable spirit, and they are also making unremitting efforts in the armed forces to improve their combat readiness and political literacy.

At the same time, we cannot avoid talking about some malformations, and we regret that these phenomena still exist among the youth.

There is no doubt that the Second World War, which brought all kinds of difficulties, left a mark on our youth. The enemy's gangs destroyed many areas of our country, forcing millions of young people and children to suffer the painful fate of displacement, and millions of children lost their parents. All this cannot but have a negative impact on the behavior of many young men and women who did not receive family influence in their childhood and experienced the suffering of the war period.

We have established children's homes for orphans and children who have lost their supporters, and we have provided material assistance to single mothers in raising their children. However, the educational work in many children's homes is obviously not satisfactory. The Soviet organs and Party organizations in many places do not care enough about the children's institutions that only accommodate boarding children.

The summary report completely correctly raised the issue of establishing boarding schools for orphans and children whose parents cannot be cultivated at home and organizing the comprehensive education of children in these schools in terms of intellectual and physical aspects to the Congress.

Our schools—whether secondary schools or higher education institutions—and all our propaganda explain the rights obtained by the Soviet people in great detail, but it seems that it is not enough to emphasize the obligations of the Soviet people at the same time, especially the most important obligation—the glory of labor.

Of course, we not only need to explain to the Soviet youth their obligation to labor gloriously and consciously with the entire people to build communism. And it should always be good at using this to educate our youth.

The Communist Party and the Soviet regime have done a lot of work to make our youth and all the Soviet people literate and educated. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, our education will reach a level and scale that is unprecedented even in the most developed capitalist countries. Our country will basically realize the universal secondary education system.

However, there are great shortcomings in the situation of secondary education. The young people we have trained after graduating from secondary school lack sufficient training for practical work.

We must cultivate practical labor habits in all our youth. This is not ordinary labor, but labor based on modern science and technology. At present, in our country's national economy being equipped with complex new technologies, secondary education is becoming more and more necessary not only for foremen but also for every worker.

Therefore, the task of educating the entire younger generation on how to practically apply their knowledge to life and the national economy has great educational significance and national economic significance.

V. I. Lenin put forward this task at that time. He said to the participants of the Third Congress of the Communist Youth League on October 2, 1920:

"The task before you is to revive the country economically, to transform and restore agriculture and industry on the basis of modern technology, based on electricity, and based on modern science and technology. You know very well that illiterate people are useless in the electrification cause, and it is not enough to be merely literate. It is not enough to just understand what electricity is here; you should understand how to technically apply electricity to industry, agriculture, and all sectors of industry and agriculture. Everyone must learn this, and must teach the entire laboring younger generation to learn this."

As everyone knows, the Party pointed out the path to solve this task at the 19th National Congress—the path of implementing comprehensive technical education in schools. But in this regard, very little has been done in practice. The Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation and other Union Republics should take various measures to complete the instructions of the Communist Party on implementing comprehensive technical education in schools in the near future. This matter is very important and necessary, and any further delay is completely intolerable. The full and reasonable solution of this task will play a major role in correctly educating our youth and training every young man and woman to actively and competently participate in communist construction.

Our numerous Lenin Communist Youth League has huge possibilities and inexhaustible potential for taking all measures in the cause of educating youth.

However, the educational work done by the Communist Youth League in schools, production units, and organs currently often has a formalistic character, degenerating into generally talking about communism and coming up with some old-fashioned remarks that are far from urgent life issues. Living daily work is replaced by plans for endless measures.

The Communist Youth League should and can change its work to fully ensure that all our youth receive a true communist education.

As for the trade union organizations, in many cases they only reduce their participation in the work of educating youth to allocating funds for mass cultural work and sports work. Comrades, this is not enough, far from enough!

At present, the Communist Youth League and trade union organizations often do not know how to and do not try to learn how to organize youth amateur activities well, and guide the youth's vigorous energy along the correct path of development. It is not enough to use this talent in the following aspects, which are: studying new technologies and agronomy, mass sports competitions, having young people stage dramas, mass entertainment and singing performances, decorating cultural palaces or clubs, and maintaining the cleanliness of cultural palaces and clubs. In many cases, it is also necessary to set up gardens and flower beds.

As long as the Communist Youth League organizations led by our Party organizations are truly responsible, and have love for their comrades and brothers who are often not cared for by them, if they are willing to do it, do we have less to do?

For example, we talk a lot about sports, but we are still far from true mass sports activities that are indeed deeply rooted in the lives of the people. We must give the most tireless care to the sports activities of the people, especially the sports activities of the youth.

Our youth will definitely, and in fact are also most actively participating in all beneficial activities, as long as these activities are truly carried out with care and enthusiasm.

Obviously, the education work for youth should be greatly improved from all aspects, from all aspects of the country and society, and even more so in the family.

Party organizations, Soviet organs, Communist Youth League organizations, trade union organizations, educators, and parents should persistently and consistently educate children and educate every young person to have socialist qualities, that is, love of labor and respect for laws and socialist morality. At the same time, we must do everything possible to strengthen and improve the Marxist-Leninist theoretical propaganda for young people, which plays a huge role in cultivating highly conscious communist builders.

Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members cannot ignore the incorrect behavior of some young people in life and in public places. Any antisocial behavior should be inquired about and socially condemned.

Our youth are looking forward to Soviet writers, filmmakers, and dramatists creating new good works, films, and dramas. These creations must be able to attract them, guide them forward, cultivate them into heroes of our great era, and help them get rid of some of the bad habits and habits that a small number of Soviet youth still maintain.

Our Party and the Soviet state will continue to educate our youth to become people who are trained in thought and physique, so that they can occupy the peak of science, master new technologies, not be afraid of difficulties, be able to overcome difficulties, not be afraid of the new wave of new construction, and not avoid arduous labor.

We should not be stingy with our strength in this major work, because correctly educating youth is the guarantee for us to achieve further achievements in communist construction. (Prolonged applause)

Comrades! The materials listed in the Central Committee's summary report and announced in the draft directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan clearly prove the great achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party, and prove the bright prospects for our motherland's progress towards communism.

We have all the necessary conditions to solve the tasks facing our country. These conditions are: a strong national economy, people who love labor, experienced cadres, an understanding of the goals of struggle and the path to achieve these goals. The whole problem now lies in: all of us—leading staff and ordinary Communist Party members—must work better and fully utilize the existing possibilities and the superiority of the socialist system, constantly improve our knowledge, and educate the Soviet people to adopt a conscious attitude towards social labor and possess great communist ideas.

We clearly know that our glorious Party and the heroic Soviet people closely united around the Party, inspired by the resolutions of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party, will launch their creative work with greater energy and strength, and achieve new outstanding achievements in building a communist society, ensuring lasting and solid world peace, and Strengthening and developing friendship among the people of all countries. (Applause)

Long live our glorious Communist Party—the organizer and motivator of all the victories of our great people! (Prolonged applause)

Long live the Communist Parties and other fraternal parties of all countries who are fighting selflessly with us for the peace, freedom, and happiness of all mankind! (Stormy, prolonged applause) (Originally published in the Soviet "Pravda" on February 21) (Xinhua News Agency)

    我不必再来列举那些能够清楚地证明最近几年来在发展我国经济方面所取得的成就的数字，也不必再举出能够说明我们党对改进我国居民的生活条件的不倦的关怀的材料了。赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中已经十分详尽地列举了这些材料。
    党中央委员会在总结的时期中十分注意到进一步发展国民经济、发展工业和克服农业上的落后现象、改进对居民的服务等问题。
    总结的时期中党在发展经济方面所实行的措施是大家都知道的。
    中央委员会对工业工作中的良好经验和缺点作了全面的研究之后，在1955年7月全会上拟定了和通过了一些措施：在各工业部门采用最新的技术、全面实行机械化和更好地组织生产；以便在这样的基础上大大提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本和改进产品质量。
    党在进一步发展工业以及把它提高到新的、更高的技术水平方面所实行的措施已经具体地反映在第二十次党代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案中。
    在农业方面，中央委员会揭发了一些农业部门，尤其是像生产谷物和畜产品的部门中所存在的严重落后的根源，现在正在实行一些措施来迅速发展整个农业。
    我们满意地看到，自从这些农业方面的措施实行以后，已经取得了初步的成绩。
    许多区和州的集体农庄庄员为提前完成党所拟定的增加农产品生产的计划而作出的保证，受到了党和人民的普遍赞同。我们有充分的根据希望，新的五年计划所规定的发展农业的任务能够在比第六个五年计划的指示草案所预定的期限短得多的时期内完成。要做到这一点，就要集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的先进经验被全体农业工作者接受，要领导工作人员和专家尽一切努力来帮助把先进经验推广到各集体农庄和国营农场中去。
    我们大家知道，建设工作在我们国家中起着怎样的作用。1956年用在基本建设上的国家资金超过1，600亿卢布，而整个第六个五年计划期间的基本建设投资是9，900亿卢布。
    中央委员会得出了正确的结论，认为只有把建筑工程转到工厂化的轨道上去，使建筑工程广泛地机械化，实行标准设计和采用最先进的建筑方法，才能保证建筑工程有必要的规模和很快的速度。在建设者——工人、工程师和技术人员亲自参加下找出了降低建筑工程造价的广大可能性。
    党中央委员会对建筑工作的一些问题作了研究之后，拟定了国民经济这个部门的具体计划。
    同志们！我们可以很清楚地想像得到，如果不是帝国主义国家使我们遭受到巨大的损失，在苏维埃政权成立后的年代里，我们可能在发展祖国的经济和文化方面做出更多的成绩，而现在也就已经可以感到我们社会主义制度的全部好处了。帝国主义国家曾经尽一切力量，想消灭第一个社会主义已经胜利了的国家。
    干涉者、白卫军分子和希特勒侵略者蹂躏了我们的祖国，并且使它遭到惨重的破坏，他们曾经打算用饥饿和经济封锁把我们扼死。在我们光荣的党的领导下的苏联人民，在掌握了政权以后，曾经为了生存和独立而不得不去进行最残酷的战争，甚至在把敌人驱逐出去以后，也还不得不经常地保持着全付武装，因而就不得不在国防上花费一笔不小的款项，才能不至于遭到措手不及的意外。
    这一切就使得我们的发展遇到困难和阻碍。后来，苏联人民的英勇斗争，他们忘我的劳动，他们的组织性和顽强精神才打乱了帝国主义分子的如意算盘，把我们这个社会主义国家提升到世界最强的国家之一的地位。
    我们也懂得，我们一切成就的取得，在很大的程度上是由于共产党、苏联政府和全体人民善于利用社会主义制度的一切可能性和优越性。
    目前，当社会主义制度在胜利地起着作用，而且实际上已经证明了它比资本主义优越的时候，我们这个执政的政党最重的工作，是制定这样一些步骤，这些步骤应当能够全面地改善我们的制度，消除个别环节中的缺点和错误，带动落后的部门，从而促进共产主义建设事业。
    我认为正是应当用这样一种尺度来衡量第十九次党代表大会以后的时期中党的活动。应当说，中央委员会作了很多工作来发掘能够进一步改善我们经济的潜力，正确地制定了如何利用这种潜力的任务，并且尽一切力量为实现这些任务而斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在向代表大会所作的中央委员会的总结报告中，以布尔什维克的坦率态度揭露了许多重大的缺点，这些缺点的铲除，是胜利实现党所规定的共产主义建设的计划的必要条件。
    这个报告特别注意到必须提高劳动生产率，因为这是胜利实现我们的计划的决定性条件，必须采用新的、先进的技术，并且掌握这种技术，在各方面厉行节约，应该对物质财富采取关心的态度。我们经济方面的巨大潜力应当充分加以利用。
    在党、苏维埃和经济方面的领导工作中，我们应当像中央委员会所要求的那样，坚决地放弃形式主义的、高高在上的官僚主义的领导方法，要更广泛地依靠先进的工人、集体农庄庄员和专家的经验，用一切方法在群众中加强灵活的组织工作。
    我们在经济和文化建设方面的成就，争取和平和各国人民友谊的成就，赫鲁晓夫同志在中央委员会总结报告中所提出来的建设共产主义的新任务，以及解决这些任务的途径和方法，这一切不仅鼓舞着共产党员，也鼓舞着每一个苏联人和我们全世界的一切朋友。
    目前，最主要的事情是，应该精力充沛地、顽强地和坚持不懈地实现共产主义建设的计划。
    同志们！中央委员会在总结报告的期间所进行的各项活动中，都坚定地和彻底地执行了列宁的集体领导的原则。
    今后，我们应当在工作中不断地巩固列宁的这个集体领导的原则，因为只有这样，我们才能防止可能发生的错误，才能把广大的劳动群众团结在党的周围。
    我们的党是人民的先锋队，它获得人民无限的信任和支持。共产党、苏维埃国家和我们全体人民是团结的、不可战胜的强大的力量。苏联人民在自己的共产党的领导下，今后将坚决地走向共产主义建设的新胜利。（经久不息的掌声）
    同志们！我们正处在这样一个时代：世界上发生着历史上前所未有的、建立新的先进的社会政治制度的过程。除了苏联以外，共占全世界人口三分之一的许多国家的人民已经坚定地走上了建设社会主义的道路，并且在这条道路上取得日新月异的成就。亚洲和非洲各国的数以亿计的人已经觉醒了，并且正在站立起来。他们正在破坏着陈旧的殖民制度大厦，破坏着这个邪恶的纪念碑，这个人民的监狱，正在建立民族国家并且积极地参加社会政治生活。
    各式各样的帝国主义分子不久以前还在残酷地剥削中国人民，残杀不屈服的中国爱国者。而现在，伟大的中华人民共和国是东方各族人民自由和独立、和平和友谊的强大堡垒，是一个规模空前的新的不断发展的社会主义建设工程。（经久不息的掌声）
    也是在不久以前，殖民主义者还在残酷无情地、暴虐地剥削印度人民，扼杀他们些微的爱好自由的表现，把印度士兵驱使到违背他们心愿的战争里去。现在，印度共和国正在作为一个伟大的、独立的国家向前发展，成为和平和各国人民之间友谊的捍卫者。（掌声）
    反对外国压迫和这种压迫所造成的严重后果的斗争席卷了亚洲和非洲各国，并且开始扩展到拉丁美洲各国。
    这一切意味着，外国统治落后国家的时代正一去不复返地走向结束。被压迫的各国人民的民族复兴和从殖民主义者的桎梏中获得完全解放的时代来到了。
    已经觉醒了的亚洲和非洲人民积极地参加了争取和平的斗争。这样一来，为伟大的和平事业而进行斗争的战士的战线无比地扩大了。同苏联、中国和所有人民民主国家人民一起，印度、缅甸、阿富汗、印度尼西亚、埃及、叙利亚和其他国家的人民正在以坚定的步伐在和平战士的行列中前进。
    苏联同中华人民共和国和所有人民民主国家，无论过去或现在都是各国人民争取和平、自由、独立和全人类幸福的主导力量。（掌声）
    布尔加宁同志和赫鲁晓夫同志在到印度、缅甸和阿富汗的访问中取得重大成就的原因还在于，他们在对这些国家的劳动群众的讲话中表达了东方各国人民所感受的思想、感情和情绪。亚洲各国人民认为，苏联代表是争取和平、民族独立和各国人民的光辉前途的不屈不挠的战士。他们看到了，苏联准备在平等的基础上，在不要别人接受军事集团或者其他一些条件以及不干涉内政的情况下尽力扩大同他们的经济联系和文化联系。（掌声）
    在中央委员会的总结报告中，赫鲁晓夫同志根据马克思主义的分析对现代国际局势发展中的三个极其重大的问题作了重要的理论概括，这三个问题就是两个制度的和平共处问题，现时代防止战争的可能性的问题和各国过渡到社会主义的形式的问题。这些问题的理论探讨是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的出色范例。
    根据马克思列宁主义对这些问题作出的正确的解决，具有重大的政治意义，因为这些问题是同世界各国人民的命运有关系的，这些问题的正确答复，武装了所有在为争取和平和各国人民的友谊、为民族独立和光明前途而斗争的战士。
    两个不同制度的和平共处，不是暂时的策略运用，而是列宁制定的苏联外交政策的原则，我们的党和苏维埃国家从建国以来一贯奉行着这个原则。
    共产党和苏维埃国家本着两个制度和平共处以及在当前发展的条件下有防止战争的可能性这样一些原则性的立场，一贯地和坚定地执行着和平和各国人民之间友好的政策。
    我们在1955年一年中所采取的外交活动就可以使人信服地说明这一点。
    大家知道，我们政府1955年5月10日就已经把一些裁减武装部队和禁止原子武器与氢武器的具体建议提交联合国讨论。我们在这方面还树立了实际上实行裁减军备的一些措施的榜样，把苏联武装部队裁减了64万人，在1956年的预算中削减了国防费用将近100亿卢布，并且撤消了旅顺口和波卡拉半岛的海军基地。
    苏联在同奥地利缔结国家条约方面表现出主动精神并且把自己的军队撤出了这个国家。苏联政府同德意志联邦共和国建立了外交关系，同德意志民主共和国签订了国家关系条约，把主张四国军队从德国撤退的建议提交给西方国家讨论。
    由于苏联的主动，苏联和南斯拉夫的友好关系恢复了，而这种关系长期以来曾经是不正常的。
    我国曾经作了不小的努力来保障日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的成功，这次会议的结果使国际紧张局势得到了缓和。
    为了加强各国人民之间相互的谅解，为了缓和国际紧张局势，在苏联坚持不懈的努力下有16个国家被接纳加入了联合国。
    为了缓和国际紧张局势、建立相互信任和巩固世界和平，共产党和苏维埃国家最高机构在发展苏联和其他国家领导人员之间的接触方面做了很多的工作。
    互相交换议会代表团对实现我们的和平政策有着重大意义。苏联最高苏维埃去年2月所通过的宣言号召建立各国议会之间的接触，这个宣言获得了世界许多国家的良好反应。
    大家知道，印度、英国、法国、日本、南斯拉夫、瑞典、芬兰、奥地利、比利时、阿尔巴尼亚、叙利亚、卢森堡、波兰、伊朗、保加利亚的议会代表团已经访问了我国。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表团也访问了芬兰、波兰、南斯拉夫、阿尔巴尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利和德意志民主共和国。
    此外，苏联最高苏维埃议员团还加入了包括40多个不同国家议会的各国议会联盟。
    许多国家议会代表团的访问苏联和苏联最高苏维埃代表团的出国访问完全证明是有效的，并且在改善各国关系方面起了重要作用。
    由于苏联的积极和平政策，国际气氛有了改善，各国人民开始松了一口气，苏联和整个社会主义民主阵营的外交地位、争取世界和平的所有战士的地位加强了。
    我们为和平而斗争，并不是因为我国软弱。苏联是一个强大的国家，它有着一切必要的可能给予任何侵略者以毁灭性的反击。我们维护和平是因为我们知道现代化战争会带来如何巨大的牺牲和毁灭。
    关于这点就是军事领导者们——我们以前的第二次世界大战中的盟友——也是知道的。如果他们能够从自己的认识中对自己的政策做出相应的结论，那就好了。（掌声）
    当然，在任何情况下我们也不能由于已经取得的成就而自满。遗憾的是，和平的敌人还存在着，他们为垄断资本致富而继续扩充军备，现在企图，今后仍要企图挑起新战争。因此，各国人民争取和平的斗争是一项极其重要的国际任务，胜利地解决这个任务不仅同苏联劳动人民有着切身的利害关系，而且同世界各国人民也一无例外地有着切身利害的关系。
    同志们！摆在我们国家面前的重大任务要求进一步加强苏维埃国家，在国家机关各环节的活动中加强社会主义法制。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在中央委员会的总结报告中所提出的共产主义建设计划的实现是同尽量发挥劳动人民的创造性的主动精神，同更加广泛地吸引他们参加管理国家的工作，同进一步发展苏维埃社会主义民主有密切关系的。
    在苏维埃国家建立以来的38年中，劳动人民代表苏维埃受到了锻炼，成长壮大起来了，它们成为构成苏维埃国家制度的牢不可破的政治基础的真正的人民权力机关。
    人民在选举运动中始终不变的积极性以及在中央和地方权力机关选举代表时选民几乎人人参加投票的情况，证明苏维埃的伟大力量。千千万万苏联人自愿地参加苏维埃的多方面活动也说明了这一点。
    在这种条件下，总结报告中所指出的苏维埃工作中存在的缺点是更加不能容忍的了。但是，遗憾的是，这种缺点还不少。
    赫鲁晓夫同志指出，一些加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃没有按照宪法的规定期限召开会议。事实上，某些加盟共和国去年只举行了一次最高苏维埃会议，而宪法规定两次。
    这不仅是在形式上违反宪法。同志们，必须注意到在苏维埃会议没有在规定期限内举行的地方，苏维埃不可避免地会丧失其对向它负责的执行机关的领导作用，结果就导致，而且不能不导致破坏苏维埃民主的原则。只有定期地召开会议，苏维埃才能及时地解决经济和文化建设方面的任务和保证使代表们积极参加管理国家的工作。值得注意的是，正是在那些苏维埃不是定期召开会议的地方，工作中的文牍主义作风就扎起根来，同群众的联系丧失了，官僚主义发展起来，工作越来越坏。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在中央委员会总结报告中指出，苏维埃应该把它们的注意力放在经济和文化建设的具体问题上，经常地把这些问题提到会议上讨论。
    遗憾的是，在苏维埃会议上提出具体的和迫切重要的问题还不够，矜夸的演说和宣言式的决议往往代替了切实的讨论。
    无须证明，只有在苏维埃会议上提出具体的问题，代表们积极参加准备和讨论问题，认真地批评缺点和多方鼓励创造性的主动精神，只有这样才能使苏维埃及其执行委员会的决议具有实际的力量，只有这样才能保证胜利地实现这些决议。
    苏维埃的力量，在于它同群众的不可分割的联系。如果脱离群众，不吸收广大的积极分子参加工作，苏维埃就不能胜任它所担负的任务。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁教导我们说，苏维埃是“向所有的人都敞开大门的、当着群众的面做一切事情的、便于群众接近并且直接来自群众的政权，它是人民群众和人民群众的意志的直接而毫无间隔的机关。”
    仅仅苏联各地的地方苏维埃就有150多万名代表，其中受过高等教育和中等教育的代表占35.6％。根据职业来分，代表当中有37，000多名工程师和中等技术人员，约有5万名农艺师、动物学家和其他农业专家，122，000名小学和中学的教师，46，000名医生、助理医生和其他医务工作人员。代表当中有企业的领导人、国营农场场长和机器拖拉机站站长、集体农庄主席、饲畜场主任以及先进的工人和集体农民。
    必须这样来进行工作：使我国的先进工作者这支大军积极地参加苏维埃的工作，使苏联的国家机关同广大的劳动群众有更加巩固的联系。
    代表向选民的汇报制度，对于加强苏维埃同居民的联系具有重大的意义。这是宪法规定的最重要的要求之一，遗憾的是，这个要求在许多情况下还没有被履行。地方苏维埃的某些代表们没有向选民们报告自己的工作和苏维埃的工作。
    党责成我们要做到：代表们同选民维持经常的联系，经常地向选民作报告，向居民解释苏维埃通过的决议，并且积极参加实现这些决议。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中指出，我们并不是一向都按照宪法的规定罢免那些辜负选民的信任的代表的。这一点在一定程度上是因为我们还没有制定出罢免代表的办法。至于罢免苏联最高苏维埃的代表的办法，有关法案已经拟好了，并且将提交苏联最高苏维埃批准，所有代表都要牢牢记住这一点。（笑声、掌声）
    各加盟共和国和自治共和国的最高苏维埃，也应该通过关于罢免共和国最高苏维埃代表和地方苏维埃代表的法律。
    必须采取措施加强加盟共和国和自治共和国最高国家权力机关的活动。应该向共和国最高苏维埃的会议提出更多的有关共和国经济和文化建设的问题，如国民经济计划、国民教育、保健事业、公用事业、道路建筑、改善居民点的设施等等问题。
    在加盟共和国和自治共和国最高苏维埃会议上研究这些问题，让地方工作人员积极参加对这些问题的讨论，将大大有助于圆满地解决经济、文化建设中日益复杂的任务和提高苏维埃领导人员在执行党和政府的指示的时候的责任感。
    赫鲁晓夫同志建议在苏联最高苏维埃民族院设立一个经济委员会，负责研究同发展加盟共和国的经济有关的实际问题，就这些问题拟出考虑周到的决议草案。这一建议是完全正确和适时的。
    在苏联最高苏维埃设立这样一个委员会，对贯彻党的进一步提高我国各民族共和国的经济和文化的措施将有很大意义。
    同志们，现在有必要谈一下立法和社会主义法制的某些问题。
    苏联的立法，一向就是动员苏联人民完成共产党向国家所提出的任务的重要因素之一。就在这个意义上可以说明苏联立法的创造力量和动员力量。
    苏联最高苏维埃即将通过许多重要的法令。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在向代表大会所作的报告中曾经说，全苏联统一的养老金制度法案最近即将提交苏联最高苏维埃批准。这项法令将根本改进关于养老金的工作。
    此外，党中央委员会还计划实行许多重要措施进一步提高苏联人民物质福利和文化水平。在这些措施当中包括有这样的任务：保证提高职工的实际工资，实行7小时工作制，而对某些行业的劳动者实行不减少工资的6小时工作制。
    由于这些重大任务的解决，就会提出修改和整顿劳动法的问题。所以需要这样做，还因为现行的加盟共和国劳动法是很多年前通过的，尽管后来做了许多补充，但是仍然不能反映在这个时期内我国所发生的社会经济的变化。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团一定要采取它所能采取的一切措施，以便加速起草苏联宪法所规定的法令，这些法令将大大整顿我们的立法，将是进一步巩固社会主义法制的重要手段。
    现在已经拟定了新的刑法和诉讼法草案，实行这两项法律，对巩固社会主义法制和保证保卫公民权利将起重大作用。
    同志们！党中央委员会非常注意巩固社会主义法制。由于采取措施的结果，检察官的监督权利完全恢复了，并且加强了。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团根据苏联共产党中央委员会的指示，批准了新的苏联检察官的监察条例。根据列宁关于苏联检察机关的作用和任务的指示而制定的条例，是检察机关活动的精确纲领，摆在它们面前的任务是：要成为为争取使苏联的一切机关、公务人员和公民严格遵守法律而斗争的、有原则性的和具有不调和的斗争精神的机关。
    为了实现党中央委员会关于加强社会主义法制的指示，除了行政措施外，还需要在教育我们的干部方面，在全体居民中广泛宣传苏联法律和全体公民严格遵守法律的必要性方面，进行巨大和细致的工作。应当使我们的干部——党、苏维埃、经济和工会工作的干部——从下到上正确地了解法律和不偏不倚地运用法律。我们的报刊应当在维护社会主义的法制的斗争中起重大的作用，它应当并且能够做许多工作。
    巩固社会主义法制的利益迫切要求改进我们国家机关在审查公民的请愿书和申诉书方面的工作。劳动人民在请愿书中不仅要求在某件事情上给予帮助，而且往往指出苏维埃机关工作中的缺点，提出改进工厂、集体农庄、国营农场以及我们机关的工作的宝贵建议。
    对许多地方苏维埃执行委员会以及对某些部进行检查的结果证明，在这个重大的国家工作上存在着严重的缺点。在一些机关里，破坏了法律对审查申诉书的期限所作的规定，对处理请愿书和对就申请书所采取的决定缺乏检查，对递请愿书人的答复常常是形式上的答复。这种对劳动人民的请愿书和申诉书所采取的漠不关心和粗枝大叶的态度，破坏了苏维埃机关的威信。
    必须坚决地根除对劳动人民的请愿书的官僚主义的态度，改进审查和满足递请愿书人的正当要求方面的工作。
    为了消除使劳动人民提出无数请愿书和合理的申诉书的根源，我们应当把主要的注意力集中在这些方面：改进苏维埃机关、企业、集体农庄和社会团体的工作，使苏维埃国家机关的工作做到无可指摘的程度，使它的一切决议都有法律根据，并且使苏维埃工作人员仔细和诚实地对待自己的职责，在自己的工作中考虑到劳动人民的利益和需求。
    同志们！我们的党和国家在把苏联人民培养成自觉的共产主义建设者方面进行着巨大的和多方面的工作。由于进行了这一工作，工人、集体农民、知识分子的政治和劳动积极性、他们的组织性和纪律性不断地提高了。
    我们在培养青年一代方面也做着许多工作。苏联青年正在成长为体力和智力都是健康的人，无限忠诚于自己光荣的祖国和共产党的人。我们的青年以战斗的热情和不屈不挠的精神在工业、农业、运输业和各种机关中劳动着，他们还在武装部队中为提高自己的战斗准备和政治素养而进行不懈的努力。
    同时，我们对这样一些畸形现象也不能避开不谈，我们感到遗憾的是，这些现象在青年中还存在。
    毫无疑问，带来种种困难的第二次世界大战在我们青年身上留下了烙印。敌人的匪帮使我国很多地区遭到破坏，迫使数以百万计的青年和儿童遭到流离失所的痛苦命运，数百万儿童丧失了自己的父母。所有这一切不能不对许多青年男女的行为起着不良的影响，他们在童年时期就没有受到家庭的影响，经历了战争时期的苦难。
    我们为孤儿和丧失扶养者的儿童建立了儿童院，在物质上帮助单身母亲扶养子女。但是，许多儿童院的教育工作显然是不能够令人满意的。许多地方的苏维埃机关和党组织对只收容寄宿儿童的儿童机构的关怀不够。
    总结报告中完全正确地向代表大会提出了为孤儿以及为父母不能在家中培养的儿童建立寄宿学校和在这些学校中组织在智力和体力方面全面教养儿童的问题。
    我们的学校——无论中等学校或者高等学校，我们的一切宣传在讲解苏联人民所获得的权利方面很详细，但是，看来同时强调苏联人民的义务，特别是最重要的义务——劳动光荣——是不够的。
    当然，我们不仅需要向苏联青年讲解他们同全体人民为建设共产主义而光荣和自觉地劳动的义务。而且应当经常地善于用这点来教育我们的青年。
    共产党和苏维埃政权已经作了许多工作，以使我们的青年和全体苏联人民成为人人识字和有教养的人。在第六个五年计划中，我们的教育将达到甚至在最发达的资本主义国家中也是空前未有的水平和规模。我国将基本上实现普及中等教育制。
    但是，中学教育的情况存在着很大的缺点。我们培养出的中学毕业的青年人对于实际工作缺乏足够的训练。
    我们必须使我们的全体青年养成实际的劳动习惯，这不是普通的劳动，而是以现代的科学和技术为基础的劳动。目前，在我国国民经济为复杂的新技术所装备的情况下，中等教育不仅对于工长、而且对于每一个工人都是越来越成为必要的了。
    因此，教育整个青年一代如何把自己的学识实际运用到生活和国民经济中去的任务，具有极大的教育意义和国民经济意义。
    弗·伊·列宁当时就提出了这个任务。他在1920年10月2日向共青团第三次代表大会的参加者说：
    “你们面前的任务，就是要在经济上复兴全国，就是要在基于现代科学和技术、基于电气的现代技术的基础上，来改造和恢复农业与工业。你们知道得很清楚，电气化事业中，不识字的人是没有用处的，而且仅仅是识字还不够。这里只懂得什么是电气还不够；应该懂得，怎样在技术上把电气应用到工业，农业以及工农业的各个部门中去。每个人必须学会这点，必须教导整个劳动青年后辈都学会这点。”
    大家知道，党在第十九次代表大会上指出了解决这个任务的道路——学校实行综合技术教育的道路。但是在这方面实际上做得还很少。俄罗斯联邦和其他加盟共和国的教育部应当采取各种措施，以求在最近时期内完成共产党关于在学校实行综合技术教育的指示。这件事情是非常重大而且必要的，再要是拖延就完全不能容忍了。这个任务的充分的、合理的解决，对正确地教育我们的青年、训练每一个青年男女去积极能干地参加共产主义建设有重大的作用。
    我们的人数众多的列宁共产主义青年团在教育青年的事业中有采取一切办法的巨大可能性和无穷尽的潜力。
    但是，共青团在学校、生产单位和机关中所作的教育工作，目前往往带有形式主义的特色，流于一般地谈谈共产主义，想出一些老一套的、远离迫切的生活问题的言论。活生生的日常工作被无穷尽的措施的计划代替了。
    共青团应当而且能够改变自己的工作，完全保证我们的全体青年受到真正的共产主义教育。
    至于工会组织，它们在许多情况下只是把参加教育青年的工作归结于拨出资金来进行群众文化工作和体育工作。同志们，这样是不够的，太不够了！
    目前，共青团和工会组织常常不善于、而且又不努力学会很好地组织青年业余活动，引导青年人的旺盛的精力沿着正确的道路发展。在下列这些方面利用这种天赋的精力是不够的，这些方面就是：研究新的技术和农艺，群众性的体育比赛，由青年来上演戏剧，群众性的娱乐和歌唱演出，装饰文化宫或者俱乐部，保持文化宫和俱乐部的整洁。在许多情况下还需要设花园和花坛。
    只要我们党组织所领导的共青团组织真正有责任感，对往往不为它们所关心的自己的同志和兄弟们有热爱，如果愿意干的话，难道我们要做的事还少吗？
    譬如，我们在体育方面谈的不少，可是，我们离真正的、的确深入到人民生活中去的群众性体育活动还远得很呢。对人民的体育活动、首先是对青年的体育活动，要作最不倦的关怀。
    我们的青年一定会、而且实际上也是最积极地参加一切有益的活动，只要真正是怀着爱护和热烈的心情来搞这些活动。
    显然，对青年的教育工作应该从各个方面，从国家和社会的各个环节来大加改进，在家庭中更不必说了。
    党组织、苏维埃机关、共青团组织、工会组织、教育工作者、父母应该坚持不懈地和贯彻始终地教育儿童和教育每一个青年人具有社会主义的品质，即热爱劳动和尊重法律和社会主义公德。同时我们必须尽一切力量加强和改善对青年人的马克思列宁主义理论的宣传，马克思列宁主义对培养高度自觉的共产主义建设者起着巨大的作用。
    共产党员和共青团团员对某些青年人在生活当中、在公共场所中的不正确的行为不能置之不问。对任何一个反社会的行为都应当加以过问和进行社会谴责。
    我们的青年期待着苏联作家、电影工作者和戏剧工作者创造出新的好的作品、影片和戏剧。这些创作要能够吸引他们，引导他们前进，培养他们成为我们伟大时代的英雄，帮助戒除某些为数不多的苏联青年现在还保持着的不良风尚和习惯。
    我们的党和苏维埃国家今后将继续教育我们青年成为在思想上和体格上有锻炼的人，使他们能够占领科学的高峰，精通新的技术，不怕困难，能够克服困难，不怕新建设的新浪潮，不回避刻苦的劳动。
    我们在这件重大的工作上不应该吝惜力量，因为正确地教育青年，是我们在共产主义建设中取得进一步成就的保证。（经久不息的掌声）
    同志们！中央委员会总结报告中所列举的以及关于第六个五年计划的指示草案中所宣布的材料，明显地证明了苏联人民在共产党的领导下取得了巨大的成绩，证明了我们祖国向共产主义前进的美好远景。
    我们有着一切必要条件来解决我们国家所面临的任务，这些条件就是：强大的国民经济，热爱劳动的人民，有经验的干部，对奋斗目标的了解和达到这一目标的道路。现在的整个问题在于：我们大家——领导工作人员和普通的共产党员——要更好地工作和充分地利用现有的可能性和社会主义制度的优越性，经常提高自己的知识，教育苏联人民对社会劳动采取自觉的态度和具备伟大的共产主义思想。
    我们清楚地知道，我们光荣的党和紧密团结在党的周围的英雄苏联人民，在共产党第二十次代表大会的决议的鼓舞下，将以更大的精力和力量展开自己的创造性的工作，在建设共产主义社会、保障持久的巩固的世界和平、加强和发展各国人民的友谊方面，取得新的出色的成就。（掌声）
    我们光荣的共产党——我们伟大人民的一切胜利的组织者和鼓舞者万岁！　（经久不息的掌声）
    同我们一道为全人类的和平、自由和幸福而进行忘我的斗争的各国共产党和其他兄弟党万岁！　（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）　（原载2月21日苏联“真理报”）（新华社）
