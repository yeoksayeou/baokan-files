On behalf of the China Democratic League, I express my warmest support for Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of other leading comrades.

I felt infinitely encouraged after listening to these reports. In the past year, our country has achieved very great victories in the struggle to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace, and in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation at home. These great victories should first of all be attributed to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I would like to extend my highest respects with the most sincere feelings to the forever victorious and forever correct Chinese Communist Party that leads us forward, and to the great people's leader and mentor Chairman Mao Zedong.

The characteristic of the current international situation is that the forces of world peace are growing stronger and stronger, increasingly surpassing the forces of war. Over the past year, international tensions have continued to ease; the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China, India, and Burma have won enthusiastic welcome and support from more and more countries and peoples; and the war blackmail policy and the so-called "brink of war" policy pursued by imperialist warmongers are becoming increasingly unpopular and are being spurned by more and more people. This is the victory of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the great victory of the world's peace forces.

On the Taiwan issue, our position and proposition are firm and unwavering. The policies and measures adopted by the Chinese Communist Party and the government are extremely wise. We do not advocate the use of force to resolve international disputes, and we are willing to seek to ease the current tense situation in the Taiwan region through negotiations. However, we will never allow the United States to continue to occupy Taiwan by force and interfere in our internal affairs with armed forces. The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never be intimidated by the aggressor's force. Taiwan itself is an internal affair of our country, and we will never allow outside interference. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have always been generous. As long as the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan have a sudden realization and are willing to respond to the call with practical actions to realize the complete reunification of the great motherland, they can be forgiven by the people of the motherland. But this is their last chance. If they are still obsessed and continue to act as accomplices and tools of U.S. imperialism in encroaching upon China's territorial sovereignty, they will not be able to save themselves from their doomed fate. Taiwan will eventually be liberated, and those who currently occupy Taiwan will eventually become sinners of the ages. I believe that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan and overseas, if they still have a shred of humanity, will not remain indifferent after hearing Chairman Zhou Enlai's benevolent and righteous appeal.

The current international situation is conducive to our country's socialist construction. We must make good use of this favorable international situation to accelerate the country's socialist construction and strive to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. At present, our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation are advancing at a rapid pace. The people of the whole country are marching towards socialism with firm, unified, and rapid steps, full of joy and excitement. In recent months, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in our country has achieved a decisive victory nationwide, bringing about fundamental changes in our country's social and economic outlook and the entire political situation.

As Chairman Mao pointed out, "Our country is currently in the upsurge of the great socialist revolution." The upsurge of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce will inevitably promote a new upsurge in the development of science, technology, culture, and education. The new situation of the socialist revolution upsurge has put forward extremely urgent and extremely important glorious tasks for intellectuals engaged in scientific research and cultural education.

It is undeniable that the number, professional level, and political awareness of intellectuals in our country in science, technology, culture, education, medicine, and health cannot meet the needs of the rapid development of our country's socialist construction. Recently, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting on the issue of intellectuals and made decisions and took concrete measures on actively training new forces, expanding the ranks of intellectuals, improving their political awareness and professional level, and related working conditions, material treatment, etc. These decisions and measures are very timely and correct. I would like to represent the members of the China Democratic League and the university teachers, scientists, engineers, literary and art workers, writers, and intellectuals in other departments who are affiliated with the China Democratic League to express our heartfelt gratitude for the wise measures taken by the Party to solve the problem of intellectuals, especially for the Party and the government's deep concern for intellectuals. Since the Party and the government have consistently trusted, valued, and supported our intellectuals, the most urgent question facing intellectuals is how to work hard to transform themselves and how to give full play to their initiative and creativity to serve socialism. In order to maximize the initiative and creativity of intellectuals, the China Democratic League is willing to assure the conference that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will redouble our efforts to promote and urge all our comrades and the masses we are connected with to actively participate in social and political practice, work hard to improve our professional skills, and systematically study Marxist-Leninist theory to accelerate self-transformation and improve our political and professional levels, so as to meet the urgent needs of the development of socialist construction. At the same time, we must also follow Chairman Mao's instructions and strive to continue to consolidate and develop the people's democratic united front and unite all forces that can be united. Striving to expand the scope of unity in the existing science, technology, culture, and education fields and unite all those who can be united to move forward together is also an important task that we must carry out at present.

Comrades, today our intellectuals have formed a brotherly alliance with workers and peasants, which is the glory of intellectuals. This socialist revolutionary alliance is the only reliable guarantee for the victory of our country's socialist cause. Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, continuously consolidate this alliance through our own unremitting efforts and creative labor, and contribute all our strength to building the motherland into a highly industrialized socialist power!

    沈钧儒的发言
    我代表中国民主同盟，对周恩来主席的政治报告和其他几位领导同志的报告，表示最热烈的拥护。
    我听了这几个报告，感到无限振奋。在过去一年中间，我国在缓和国际紧张局势、巩固世界和平的斗争中，在国内社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业中，都取得了非常伟大的胜利。这些伟大胜利的取得，首先应当归功于中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导。我要用最诚挚的心意，对领导着我们前进的、永远胜利、永远正确的中国共产党和伟大的人民领袖和导师毛泽东主席，致以最崇高的敬礼。
    当前国际形势的特点是世界和平力量日益强大，日益超过了战争力量。一年来国际紧张局势继续趋向缓和；我国和印度、缅甸所共同倡议的和平共处五项原则，已赢得了越来越多的国家和人民的热烈欢迎和支持；而帝国主义战争贩子们所推行的战争讹诈政策和所谓“战争边缘”政策，越来越不得人心，遭到越来越多的人民的唾弃。这是以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的胜利，是全世界和平力量的伟大胜利。
    在台湾问题上，我们的立场和主张是坚定不移的。中国共产党和政府所采取的政策措施，是十分英明的。我们不主张用武力解决国际争端，我们愿意通过协商方式，以求缓和在台湾地区目前的紧张局面。但是我们决不容许美国继续用武力侵占台湾，用武装力量干涉我国内政。已经站起来了的中国人民，是永远不会被侵略者的武力所吓倒的。关于台湾本身，是我们国家内部的事，我们决不容许外人干涉。中国共产党和人民政府从来就是宽大为怀的。只要台湾国民党军政人员幡然悔悟，愿意用实际行动来响应号召，实现伟大祖国的完全统一，他们是能够得到祖国人民的宽恕的。但这是他们最后一次的机会了。假如他们还要执迷不悟，继续充当美帝国主义侵犯中国领土主权的帮凶和工具，他们将无法挽救他们自己灭亡的命运。台湾最后一定能够解放，而目前窃据台湾的人们，终将成为千古罪人。我相信在台湾和海外的国民党军政人员，要是还有一点人性，听到了周恩来主席那样仁至义尽的号召，总不会无动于中罢。
    当前的国际形势是有利于我国社会主义建设的。我们一定要很好地利用这种有利的国际形势来加速国家的社会主义建设，为提早和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。目前我国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造正在以飞快的速度向前开展着。全国人民正以坚定一致的快速步伐，欢欣鼓舞地奔向社会主义。最近几个月来，我国的农业、手工业和资本主义工商业这三方面的社会主义改造，在全国范围内取得了决定性的胜利，使我国的社会经济面貌和整个政治形势起了根本性的变化。
    正如毛主席所指示，“目前我国正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中”。农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮，将必然促进科学、技术、文化、教育等事业发展的新高潮。社会主义革命高潮的新形势对于从事科学研究和文化教育等事业的知识分子提出了极其迫切、极其重大的光荣任务。
    无可讳言，我国目前的科学、技术、文化、教育、医药卫生等方面的知识分子，在数量上、业务水平上和政治觉悟上都不能适应我国社会主义建设急速发展的需要。最近中国共产党中央召开了关于知识分子问题的会议，在积极培养新生力量、扩大知识分子的队伍、提高他们的政治觉悟和业务水平，以及有关工作条件、物质待遇等等方面，都作出了决定，采取了具体的措施。这些决定和措施，都是十分及时的，也是十分正确的。我愿意代表民盟的和民盟所联系的大学教师、科学家、工程师、文艺工作者、著作家及其他部门的知识分子，对党所决定的解决知识分子问题的英明措施，特别是对党和政府对知识分子的深切关怀，表示衷心的感谢。党和政府对于我们知识分子一贯地加以信任、重视和支持，那么摆在知识分子面前的一个最最迫切的问题，就是如何努力改造自己，如何充分发挥自己的积极性和创造性以为社会主义服务了。为了使知识分子的积极性和创造性能够得到最大限度的发挥，我们中国民主同盟，愿向大会保证，我们将在中国共产党的领导下，加倍努力来推动和督促我们全体同志和所联系的群众，积极参加社会政治实践，努力搞好业务，有系统地学习马克思列宁主义理论，来加速自我改造，提高自己的政治和业务水平，以适应社会主义建设事业发展的迫切需要。同时，我们也一定要遵照毛主席的指示，为继续巩固和发展人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量而努力奋斗。努力扩大现有科技文教界方面的团结面，把一切可能团结的人都团结起来，共同前进，这也是目前我们必须进行的一项重要工作。
    同志们，今天我们的知识分子已经同工人、农民结成了兄弟联盟，这是知识分子的光荣。这一社会主义的革命联盟，是我国社会主义事业胜利的唯一可靠保证。让我们在中国共产党领导之下，通过自己不懈的努力和创造性的劳动来不断地巩固这一联盟，为了把祖国建设成为一个高度工业化的社会主义强国而贡献出自己的一切力量吧！
