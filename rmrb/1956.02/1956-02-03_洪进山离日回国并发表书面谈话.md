Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 2nd: Chinese national Hong Jinshan, who was illegally arrested by Japanese police authorities last November when he was scheduled to return to China on the "Xingan Maru" ship, finally left the Japanese port of Moji on the "Yamasusume Maru" ship on February 1st and returned to China, thanks to the efforts of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and the Tokyo Chinese General Association.

    Hong Jinshan issued a written statement entitled "A Message to My Dear Compatriots in Taiwan" upon leaving Japan. He said: Dear compatriots in Taiwan! Now I must temporarily part with you. I am returning to our motherland—the People's Republic of China—with boundless excitement and hope. But I believe that in the near future, I will be able to meet with you all, and that will mark the moment when the five-star red flag of peace and happiness is planted in Taiwan.

    Hong Jinshan described the dark rule suffered by the people of Taiwan today and expressed his hatred for the United States' occupation of China's sacred territory of Taiwan. He concluded by saying that we must recover Taiwan from the hands of the American aggressors. We must liberate our homeland.

    洪进山离日回国并发表书面谈话
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：去年11月预定搭“兴安丸”轮船归国而被日本警察当局非法拘捕的中国侨民洪进山，经过日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络会和东京华侨总会的努力，终于在2月1日下午搭乘“山鸟丸”轮船离开日本港口门司返国。
    洪进山离开日本时发表了一篇题为“告亲爱的台湾同胞”的书面谈话。他说：亲爱的台湾同胞！现在我不得不暂时和大家离别了。我抱着无限的兴奋和希望要回到我们的祖国——中华人民共和国。可是我相信在不久的将来，我能够同大家会见，那正是标志着和平幸福的五星红旗插到台湾的时候。
    洪进山叙述了台湾同胞在今天所受的黑暗统治并且表示了他对美国霸占中国神圣领土台湾的愤恨。他最后说，我们一定要从美国侵略者手里收复台湾。我们一定要解放我们的故乡。
