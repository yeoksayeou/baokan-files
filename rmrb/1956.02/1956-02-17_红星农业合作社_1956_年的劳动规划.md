    Red Star Agricultural Cooperative's 1956 Labor Plan
    Zhang Zongyin
    The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shijing Township, Hejian County, Hebei Province, is an advanced cooperative formed by merging 17 elementary cooperatives and absorbing 111 individual farmers. The members are distributed in 4 villages, totaling 2,056 households, 9,207 people, and 5,507 laborers. They have 25,583 mu of cultivated land and 991 mu of orchards.
    With a larger cooperative, more people, more threads, and more complicated matters, there must be a corresponding management system, especially a comprehensive labor plan. In terms of the cooperative's leadership, it is necessary to criticize and overcome the thinking of "temporary grab-it-all" and the working methods of "all-in-one," "hand-held kettle," "old sheep driving the mountain," and "piecemeal," and gradually develop towards institutionalization and standardization. Currently, the Red Star Cooperative is formulating a labor plan and rectifying labor organization and labor discipline according to the plan. People unanimously believe that to run a large cooperative, everything must be done according to regulations and plans.
    Formulate a Labor Day Expenditure Plan and a Labor Income Plan
    In 1955, Zhao Changxing, a male member of the Red Star Cooperative, worked 324 days throughout the year, and Feng Suolan, a female member, worked 248 days throughout the year. Zhao Yuanchang (as a feeder), who was 71 years old, worked 330 days throughout the year. Since they have already worked so many workdays, most members can also do it with effort. Since the winter of 1955, the members' socialist enthusiasm and production enthusiasm have been in full swing, turning the winter slack into winter busy. Many jobs that had never been done in winter since ancient times were completed this winter. Since the transformation into an advanced cooperative, the members have been calculating: In 1955, one workday was divided into more than one yuan; if the land is not divided for dividends, plus increased production, wouldn't one workday be able to be divided even more? How many workdays will I do in 1956? How much can I get? When setting a personal work plan, male member Feng Jingwen said: "I worked more than 320 days in 1955 and earned 272 workdays. In 1956, except for a few days delayed by heavy rain and the Spring Festival, and I don't go to the market or visit relatives, unless I have a serious illness that prevents me from sleeping on the kang, I guarantee to work 330 days a year." Female member Zhang Fengyun said: "In the future, rolling mills and needlework will all use machines; I can take care of some other housework in the evening; I can definitely work more than 270 days a year." Recently, each member has made their own 1956 work plan. The cooperative has a total of 3,426 able-bodied men and women, with a total planned work output of 918,168 days, an average of 268 days per person; calculated at one workday per day, this equals 918,168 workdays. There are a total of 1,412 male and female semi-able-bodied laborers, with a total planned work output of 392,536 days, an average of 278 days per person; calculated at seven-tenths of a workday per day, this equals 274,775 workdays. There are a total of 669 male and female auxiliary laborers, with a total planned work output of 100,350 days, an average of 150 days per person; calculated at four-tenths of a workday per day, this equals 40,140 workdays. The cooperative plans a total work output of 1,411,054 days for all types of laborers, approximately equivalent to 1,233,083 workdays. When each laborer makes their annual work plan, they generally make relatively thorough calculations, and it is estimated that they can generally complete the planned work output. However, due to lack of experience, in order to avoid the labor day expenditure plan from failing, the planned work output is uniformly calculated at 70%. In this way, the actual expected workdays are 987,737, approximately equivalent to 863,158 workdays. According to the contract work and production plan: Agricultural labor days expenditure per mu: cotton 25 days, peanuts 20 days, spring sweet potatoes 12 days, spring corn 10 days, millet 10 days, wheat 9 days. The total agricultural labor day expenditure is 439,629 days. Vegetable garden labor day expenditure per mu is 50 days, totaling 49,550 days. The total animal husbandry labor day expenditure is 129,548 days. The total sideline labor day expenditure is 72,470 days. The total capital construction labor day expenditure is 135,961 days. The total cooperative affairs management labor day expenditure is 36,000 days. The total labor day expenditure for the cooperative throughout the year is 863,158 days. Because 8 operations such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, harvesting, intertillage, spraying phosphorus, spraying pesticides, and weeding are replaced by machines instead of manual labor, it can reduce labor day expenditure by 46,800 days. The actual labor day expenditure required for all industries throughout the year is 816,358 days.
    The total net income of the cooperative in 1956 is estimated to be 3,331,574 yuan. It is estimated that each workday can be divided into 3 yuan and 8 jiao and 6 fen. A general able-bodied laborer can be divided into 765 yuan and 4 jiao; a semi-able-bodied laborer can be divided into 555 yuan and 8 jiao; and an auxiliary laborer can be divided into 171 yuan and 4 jiao. 社员 Zhao Rongchang, with a total of 7 laborers, is expected to divide 5,148 yuan per household, an increase of 446% compared to 1955. 社员 Zhao Lishui, with a total of 3 laborers, is expected to divide 2,087 yuan per household, an increase of 384% compared to 1955.
    Organize Labor Force According to New Needs and Divide Cultivation Areas
    In 1954, 社员 Sun Jingpu and Wang Zhongqin, because they were not experts in repairing fruit trees, mistakenly picked half a basket of pear blossoms as pear dogs (diseased branches); Wang Zhongzhang, who was most knowledgeable about fruit trees, was often assigned to do agricultural work all year round. In 1955, one cooperative did not implement division of labor and specialization, and 200 mu of pear trees were eaten by insects, resulting in no pears that year and no pears the following year. This year, after the merger and upgrade, the cooperative is even larger, and it is even more impossible without good division of labor and specialization. In the labor plan, the entire cooperative is divided into four aspects: agriculture, orchard, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. In agriculture, managing 25,583 mu of land, there are 4,411 fixed laborers, divided into 21 agricultural production teams (including a youth production team). In the orchard, managing 991 mu of fruit trees, there are 516 fixed laborers, divided into 4 orchard production teams. In animal husbandry, it is planned to establish a pig farm to centrally manage 609 draught animals, 10,000 pigs, 166 sheep, and 200 pairs of domestic rabbits, with 540 fixed laborers, divided into a draught animal breeding team and a livestock breeding team. In sideline occupations, managing two kinds of perennial sideline occupations, there are 40 fixed laborers; managing five kinds of seasonal and temporary sideline occupations, there are no fixed laborers, and they are drawn from other production teams when needed.
    When the various cooperatives merged, there were 62 production teams. According to the specific situation after the merger, dividing into so many teams makes it inconvenient to match the backbone and means of production, and it is not possible to better exert the role of the production team, and it is not suitable for the management needs of a large cooperative. Therefore, it was reorganized into more than 20 production teams. Each team has about 190 laborers, more than twice as many as in the past. Each team is equipped with a full-time captain and a vice-captain in charge of political, technical, women's work, and administrative work, as well as an accountant and an accounting assistant. Each team is divided into 8 production groups, each group having about 10 able-bodied men and women, 3 to 5 semi-able-bodied laborers, for a total of more than 20 people. Each group is equipped with 3 full-time and part-time leaders, including 1 woman.
    How should the cultivation area be divided? Initially, it was registered plot by plot according to the small plots of the original households. This is very troublesome, confusing, and inevitably leaves some small plots unregistered. In fact, the land of each household in the four villages has become collectively owned, and this is no longer necessary. Later, it was decided to adopt a new method: after on-the-spot investigation, based on soil quality, suitable crops, and isolation by unavoidable natural obstacles, the 25,583 mu of land in the whole cooperative (originally more than 13,500 small plots) was divided into 80 areas (including 27 mechanized farming areas), averaging 320 mu per plot, with the largest plot being more than 2,800 mu. This is the first step in dividing the cultivation area. Then, according to the requirements of the national plan, based on adapting to the soil quality, striving to make more use of various machines, and facilitating machine operation as much as possible, the crops to be planted in each area are determined. This is the second step. Then, according to the crop growth time, taking care of the busy and slack periods of each team's work, the large plots are distributed to each team. This can not only maintain the large-scale planting of various crops, adapt to mechanized farming, and facilitate management, but also make it easier for each team to allocate labor. For example, the first mechanized farming area is planted with 2,809 mu of corn, which is divided into 12 strips. It was distributed to 12 teams. This is the third step. The Management Committee pointed out the place names, neighbors, length, width, and mu number of the land allocated to each team, and notified each team, and sent people from the Management Committee to guide each team to measure all the allocated land with a ruler. Because the land is large, it is quick to measure and does not take much effort. After the measurement, boundary markers are inserted on the head of the land. This is the fourth step. There are still 3 farmers outside the cooperative in Shijing Township, and they have a total of 36 mu of land. Based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, the cooperative allocated equal land to exchange for their land, without hindering mechanized farming and unified management.
    Formulate Work Norms and Remuneration Standards
    How should the income from collective labor be distributed to more than 5,000 laborers? Two rulers for calculating labor must be made well. Only after measuring clearly with these two rulers can the distribution be reasonable. One ruler is the work norm, which is used to calculate the quantity and quality of labor; the other ruler is the remuneration standard, which is used to calculate labor remuneration. The Red Star Cooperative formulated 238 work norms and seven remuneration standards in the spring of 1955. After a year of testing, it has been proved that the labor is calculated quite accurately using this ruler. Now that the cooperative is larger and the situation is more complicated, the original work norms are not enough; recently, in the labor plan, the work norms have been reviewed, revised, and supplemented, increasing to 731 items. After all the work norms for agriculture, orchards, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, etc. are stipulated, they are uniformly divided into nine grades according to the conditions of the lightness and heaviness of the work, the strength of technology, the degree of importance, the busy and slack agricultural seasons, and the cleanliness, after repeated comparisons between the grades and between the grades. Each grade stipulates a certain number of work points. Work norms belonging to the first grade are calculated at 12 work points each; work norms belonging to the ninth grade are calculated at 4 work points each. Under the leadership of a certain department of the Management Committee, six or seven experienced old farmers were hired to make a draft of the work norms and remuneration standards. The draft was repeatedly discussed, revised, and supplemented by the members, and finally passed by the members' representative assembly, and it became a standard that all members unanimously followed.
    Formulate Contract Work Plan
    After the production teams and cultivation areas are divided, the work norms and remuneration standards are stipulated, and the technical operating procedures for crops are prepared, the contract work plan is formulated. The Red Star Cooperative does it this way: First, various crops are divided into several categories according to different soil quality and fertility, different labor, and different required yields. The estimated number of labor days for each type of crop and the required yield are determined according to the actual situation. For example, first-class pear trees are trees with fewer insects and a cleaner base, so the number of labor days is less, and more pears are required; seventh-class pear trees are trees with more insects and a mixed base, and the leaves were not preserved last year. These trees are calculated with more labor days, no pears are required, and it is only required to preserve the leaves this year. Second, the number of labor days, the amount of investment, and the required output of each type of crop in each grade are calculated. First, according to the technical operating procedures for crops, and based on the spirit of fine processing, the total number of processes required throughout the year is determined. Then, the number of labor days is calculated item by item according to the work norms and remuneration standards, and the number of items used and the depreciation of supplies are calculated at the same time. Mechanized farming costs are paid uniformly by the cooperative; all processes in which machines replace manpower are deducted from the total number of labor days under the overall contract. It is more convenient to calculate the contracted labor days by unit of each process; because there may be increased or decreased labor in certain processes due to special reasons in the middle. Adding up the number of labor days, the amount of investment, and the required output per mu of each type of crop, the total number of labor days, the amount of investment, and the output of this type of crop in the entire cooperative can be calculated. Third, calculate the number of contracted work and production from the entire cooperative to each team. The accurate number of how much land each team is divided into, including how many mu of each type of crop in each grade, is available; the number of how many processes each crop includes, how many labor days each process takes, and what items are used, and the total number of labor days and the yield per mu, are also available. Multiplying these two can calculate the number of contracted work and production for each team and the number of means of production that the Management Committee guarantees to supply to each team. Animal husbandry also implements contract work and production in the same way as agriculture and orchards.
    Formulate Labor Force Use Plan
    In the new situation of running large-scale advanced cooperatives, if production is directed piecemeal and by temporary ideas, chaos will inevitably occur, causing the production plan to fail. The labor plan must include the annual and phased labor force use plan. In the Red Star Cooperative's agriculture and orchards, all the work of the year is divided into 24 segments, roughly half a month per segment; then, the work of each segment is arranged in order of priority to see what kind of work there is, the start and end dates and number of days of the work, the number of various laborers needed, and the amount of animal power used. This plan is the basis for organizing the labor force and directing production. By summing up the phased plans of each industry, it can be calculated how many of each type of labor force and animal power each industry needs in each half month, and whether there is a surplus or shortage compared with the perennial fixed labor force and animal power of this industry. According to the spirit of focusing on operating agriculture and orchards and taking care of the overall situation, it can be determined how to adjust the labor and animal power of each industry. During the slack agricultural season, when agriculture and orchards have surplus labor, the sideline occupation team is responsible for organizing sideline production and carrying out necessary capital construction; during the busy agricultural season, various productions in the sideline occupation aspect are suspended or reduced. Before the Spring Festival, the plan for the use and mutual adjustment of the labor force of the entire cooperative throughout the year is prepared. Usually, a meeting to allocate labor is held every 15 days to summarize the production of the first half of the month, and according to the phased labor force use plan of each industry and the actual situation at the time, the production tasks for the second half of the month are stipulated, which are transmitted by the Management Committee to each team for execution. The team meeting is also held every 15 days to summarize the production of the first half of the month, and according to the 15-day production task assigned by the Management Committee and the actual situation of the team, the team's production plan for the second half of the month is made. Each team's 15-day production plan is divided into three small segments, roughly one segment every 5 days. Then, each team contracts the production task of each small segment to each production group. The captain and other people and the leaders of each group meet roughly once every 5 days to study and solve production problems, and decide on the contracted work plan for each group for the next small segment drafted by the captain and the team's accountant, and then discuss and pass it at the team meeting. On the contracted work plan for each small segment of each group, it is stipulated what work to do, how much to do, what quality to achieve, when to complete it, and how many labor days should be given according to the unified work norms and remuneration standards of the entire cooperative. In this way, even illiterate people who know "small multiplication tables" and "oral accounts" can calculate how much work they have done and how many labor days they should get. The captain distributes the work cards for calculating labor days to the group leaders according to the number of contracted work of each group in a small segment. The group leader checks the work and issues the work cards on the spot every day. At the end of each small segment, when the group submits work to the team, extra work will be compensated with labor days, and less work will be reduced with labor days; if some work does not meet the quality, the captain decides to let them rework or deduct labor days. 社员 records work with the team's accountant every 5 days, and records labor days with the work card. The work record form filled out at that time is kept by 社员, and the form is stamped by the accountant. The work record form kept by the team is also filled out at the same time. The team reports work to the cooperative once a month. The team and the cooperative both establish labor accounts. Each production team of each industry statistically analyzes the activities of various types of labor force and animal power in the team every 5 days according to the work record form kept in the team, including the progress and the number of days of labor attendance and absenteeism, item by item. Labor such as picking up firewood, cutting grass, and doing needlework for the cooperative, as well as absenteeism due to illness, visiting relatives, and work stoppage, should also be statistically analyzed. The Management Committee statistically analyzes the labor activity of each team in each industry every 5 days. In this way, it can timely know the extent to which each team has completed the 15-day production task, know how much labor is invested in inappropriate and unnecessary places and why, and how much labor is absent from work and why, so that it can be studied and solved in time, overcome shortcomings, and solve problems.

    红星农业合作社1956年的劳动规划
    张宗荫
    河北省河间县诗经乡红星农业生产合作社，是17个初级社合并又吸收111户个体农民参加组成的一个高级社。社员分布在4个村，共2，056户，9，207人，5，507个劳动力。他们有25，583亩耕地，991亩果园。
    社大了，人多了，头绪多，事情杂，必须有一套相适应的经营管理制度，特别是要有全面的劳动规划。在社的领导方面，要批判和克服“临时一把抓”的思想，和“一揽子”“手把壶”“老羊赶山”“零打碎敲”的工作方法，逐步向制度化和正规化发展。现在，红星社正在制定劳动规划，并且根据规划整顿劳动组织和劳动纪律。人们一致认为：办大社就得一切按章程、按规划办事。
    制定劳动日支出计划和劳动收入计划
    1955年，红星社男社员赵长兴全年出工324天，女社员冯素兰全年出工248天，71岁的赵元昌（当饲养员）全年出工330天。既然他们已经做了这么多工作日，绝大部分社员经过努力也可能做到。1955年冬季以来，社员的社会主义劲头和生产劲头热火朝天，把冬闲变成了冬忙，自古以来冬天没作过的许多活，这年冬天完成了。从转成高级社，社员都在盘算：1955年，一个劳动日就分了一元多；如果土地不分红，再加上增产，一个劳动日不就能分的更多吗？1956年自己做多少劳动日？能分多少？在定个人工作计划的时候，男社员冯景文说：“我1955年作了320多天的活，挣了272个劳动日。1956年除了下大雨和过春节耽误几天，我又不赶集、不走亲戚，要不是生不起炕的大病，我保险一年作330天的活。”女社员张凤云说：“以后推碾磨、作针线活，都使用机器了；有点别的家务劳动，我晚上捎带着就料理好了；我一年准能干270多天的活。”最近，每个社员都作了自己1956年度的工作计划。全社男女全劳动力共3，426人，共计划出工918，168天，每人平均268天；按平均每天一个劳动日计算，合918，168个劳动日。男女半劳动力共1，412人，共计划出工392，536天，每人平均278天；按每天七分工计算，合274，775个劳动日。男女附带劳动力669人，共计划出工100，350天，每人平均150天；按每天四分工计算，合40，140个劳动日。全社各类劳动力总共计划出工1，411，054天，大约做1，233，083个劳动日。每个劳动力作自己的全年出工计划的时候，一般地都作了比较周到的盘算，估计一般都能完成计划的出工数。但是，因为缺乏经验，为避免劳动日的支出计划落空，所以把计划出工数，一律按70％计算。这样，实际指望的有987，737个工作日，大约合863，158个劳动日。按包工包产方案：农业每亩支出劳动日：棉花25个，花生20个，春山芋12个，春玉米10个，谷子10个，小麦9个。农业共计用劳动日439，629个。菜园每亩支出劳动日50个，共计49，550个。畜牧业共计支出劳动日129，548个。副业共计支出劳动日72，470个。基本建设共计支出劳动日135，961个。社务管理共计支出劳动日36，000个。全社全年总共计支出劳动日863，158个。由于耕、耙、播种、收割、中耕、喷磷、喷药、锄草等8种作业，由机器代替了人工，能减少支出劳动日46，800个，实际全年各业共需要支出劳动日816，358个。
    1956年全社预计总共纯收入3，331，574元。预计每个劳动日能分到3元8角6分。一般的全劳动力能分到765元4角；半劳动力能分到555元8角；附带劳力能分到171元4角。社员赵荣昌，共7个劳力，预计一户能分5，148元，比1955年增加收入446％。社员赵立水，共3个劳力，预计一户能分2，087元，比1955年增加收入384％。
    按照新的需要组织劳动力划分耕作区
    1954年，社员孙敬朴、王忠勤，因为修理果树外行，曾经把梨树的花蕾，误当作梨狗（病虫枝）摘了半篮子；对果树最内行的王仲章，倒常年被分配作农业活。1955年，有一个社没有实行分工分业，有200亩梨树被虫子吃得当年没结梨，第二年也结不了梨。今年并社升级以后，社更大了，不很好地分工分业，就更不行了。在劳动规划中，全社分为农业、果园、畜牧、副业4个方面。在农业方面，经营着25，583亩土地，有固定劳动力4，411人，划分为21个农业生产队（包括一个青年生产队）。在果园方面，经营着991亩果树，有固定劳动力516人，划分为4个果园生产队。在畜牧方面，计划建立养猪场，集中经营609头耕畜、1万只猪、166只羊、200对家兔，有固定劳动力540人，划分为耕畜饲养队、家畜饲养队各一个。在副业方面，经营常年副业两种，有固定劳动力40人；经营季节性和临时性副业五种，没有固定劳动力，需要的时候由别的生产队抽调。
    各个社合并的时候，有62个生产队。按照并社以后的具体情况来看，分这么多的队，骨干和生产资料不便于搭配，不能更好地发挥生产队的作用，不能适应大社经营管理的需要。因此，改编成了20多个生产队。每个队有劳动力190人左右，比过去大了一倍多。每队设正队长及分管政治、技术、妇女工作、行政工作的副队长各一人，会计员和会计助手各1人。每个队分成8个生产组，每组有男女全劳动力各10人左右，半劳动力3人到5人，共20多人。每组设正副组长3人、其中包括妇女1人。
    耕作区怎样划分呢？最初，是按原属各户的小地块逐块登记的。这样做，费事很大，纠缠不清，还难免丢下一些小地块没有登记上。其实，4个村各户的土地已经成为集体所有的了，这样做已经没有必要了。后来，决定采用新办法：经过实地勘查，根据土质、适种作物、不可消除的自然障碍物的隔离等条件，把全社的25，583亩土地（原来是13，500多小块地），划分为80个地区（其中包括27个机耕区），平均每块320亩，最大的一块2，800多亩。这是划耕作区的第一步。然后，按着国家计划的要求，本着适应土质、争取更多地利用各种机器、尽量便利机器操作等原则，确定各个地区的种植作物。这是第二步。然后，再按照作物生长时间，照顾各队工作忙闲，把大块地分给各队。这样既能保持各种作物的大面积播种，适应机耕，便于管理，又能使各队便于调配劳动力。如第一号机耕区是种2，809亩玉米，共分了12条。分给了12个队。这是第三步。管委会把分给各队的地，指出地名、四邻、长度、宽度、亩数等项目，通知各队，并由管委会派人指引，由各队把所分的地一律下弓丈量。因为地是大块，量起来很快，并不怎么费事。量了以后，就在地头上插上界牌。这是第四步。诗经乡总共还有3户社外农民，他们共有36亩土地。合作社本着自愿互利原则，在不妨碍机耕和统一经营的条件下，拨出相等的土地换了他们这些地。
    制定工作定额和报酬标准
    5，000多个劳动力，怎样分配共同劳动的收益呢？必须作好计算劳动的两个尺子，用这两个尺子量清楚了再分，才能分得合理。一个尺子就是工作定额，是计算劳动的数量质量用的；一个尺子就是报酬标准，是计算劳动报酬用的。红星社在1955年春季就订出了238项工作定额和七等报酬标准。经过一年来的试验，证明用这种尺子计算劳动算得挺准。现在社大了，情况更复杂了，原来的工作定额不够使用了；最近，在劳动规划中，审查、修订、补充了工作定额，增加到了731项。农业、果园、畜牧、副业等各业所有的工作定额规定好了以后，就根据活的轻重、技术性强弱、重要程度、农忙农闲、脏净等条件，经过一等之间以及等和等之间的反复评比，统一划分为九等，各等规定一定的工分。属于第一等的工作定额，每个算12分工；第九等的定额，每个算4分工。在管理委员会的一定部门的领导下，聘请了六、七个富有经验的老农，作出了工作定额和报酬标准的草稿。草稿经社员反复讨论、修正补充，最后经过社员代表大会通过，就成了全体社员一致遵循的标准。
    制定包工方案
    划好了生产队和耕作区，规定了工作定额和报酬标准，作好了农作物技术操作规程，就制定包工方案。红星社是这样作的：第一步，把各种作物按土质及地力不同，用工及要求产量不同，分成几类。各类作物预计用劳动日多少，要求产量多少，按实际情况确定。如一等梨树是虫子少、底子净的树，计算劳动日少，要梨多；七等梨树是虫子多、底子杂，去年没保住叶子的树，这类树计算劳动日多，不要梨，只要今年保住叶子就行。第二步，核算全社各种作物每一等用劳动日数、投资数及要求的产量数。先根据农作物技术操作规程，并且本着加工细作的精神，确定全年共需要多少道工序。再把各项工序逐项地根据工作定额及报酬标准，算出用劳动日数，同时算出这项工序所应用的物品数和用品折价数。机耕费由社统一交付；机器代替人力的各道工序，一律在总包的劳动日数内扣除。以每道工序为单位，核算包的劳动日数，计算起来比较方便；因为中途可能由于特殊原因在某些工序上增工或减工。把每类作物每亩地用劳动日数、投资数、要求产量数加起来，就可以计算出全社这类作物总共用劳动日多少、投资多少、产量多少。第三步，核算全社到各队的包工包产数。各队各分多少地，其中各种作物各等地各多少亩，都有了准数；每种作物各包括多少道工序，每道工序用多少劳动日和用些什么物品，共计每亩用多少劳动日、产量多少，也都有了准数。这两者相乘，就可以算出各队的包工包产数及管委会保证供应各队的生产资料数。畜牧业也和农业、果园业同样实行包工包产。
    制定劳动力使用计划
    在办了大型高级社的新情况下，再零打碎敲、现想现碰地指挥生产，必然会出现混乱现象，使生产计划落空。在劳动规划中，必须包括全年的和分段的劳动力使用计划。红星社的农业和果园，都把本业全年的活，分成24段，大致半月算一段；再把每段的活按先后排列出来，看都有些什么活，作活的起止月日和天数，需要使用各种劳动力各多少，使用畜力多少。这个计划是组织劳动力、指挥生产的根据。把各业的分段计划汇总起来，就可以计算出全社每半月当中，各业各需要那类劳动力及畜力各多少，同这一业的常年固定劳动力及畜力比较是余是缺。根据以经营农业和果园为主、照顾全局的精神，就可以确定各业的劳、畜力如何调剂。农闲季节，农业、果园有剩余的劳动力，副业队就负责组织副业生产和进行必要的基本建设；农忙季节，副业方面的各项生产就分别停办或是减人。在春节以前，就把全社全年劳动力使用和互相调剂的计划作好。平日，支配劳动力的会议每15天要开一次，总结上半月生产，并且根据各业分段劳动力使用计划和当时的实际情况，规定下半月的生产任务，由管委会传达到各队执行。队务会议也是每15天召开一次，总结上半月生产，根据管委会布置的15天生产任务及本队的实际情况，作出本队下半月的生产计划。各队15天的生产计划，分成三小段，大约每5天算一段。然后，各队把每个小段的生产任务包给各生产小组。队长等人和各组组长大约5天碰头一次，研究解决生产上的问题，决定由队长和队里的会计员起草的下一个小段各组的包工计划，然后在队员会上讨论通过。在各组每小段的包工计划上，规定好作什么活，做多少，达到什么质量，什么时候完成，按全社统一的工作定额和报酬标准算出应给多少劳动日。这样，凡是会“小九九”和“口挨账”的文盲，也都会计算出来自己作了多少活，应该得多少劳动日。队长按一小段各组的包工数，把计算劳动日的工牌发给小组长。组长每天当时验工，在地头上发给工牌。在每一小段结束小组向队交工的时候，多作了活要补劳动日，少作了活要减劳动日；如有的活没达到质量，由队长决定让他们返工或扣减劳动日。社员每5天在队里的会计员那里记工一次，凭工牌记劳动日。当时填妥由社员收执的记工表，表上由会计员盖章。同时填妥队里存的记工表。队向社一个月报工一次。队和社都设立劳动工账。各业的各个生产队，根据队里存的记工表，每5天把本队各类劳动力及畜力活动情况，包括进度及劳动力出勤、缺勤天数，分项进行统计。给社里拾柴、割草、作针线活等劳动，以及因为闹病、走亲戚、歇工等缺勤情况，也要进行统计。管理委员会每5天把各业各队劳力活动情况统计一次。这样，就能及时地知道各队完成15天生产任务的程度，知道有多少劳力为什么投到不适当和不必要的地方，有多少劳力为什么旷工，就可以及时研究，克服缺点，解决问题。
