To the Editor:

The Tangshan Transportation Electrical Equipment Company of Hebei Province commissioned several machine factories in Tangshan and Tianjin to assemble a batch of complete sets of horse carriage undercarriages in the fourth quarter of 1955. The bearings used in these horse carriage undercarriages were all products of the Changzhi Bearing Factory in Shanxi. During the assembly process, it was found that the quality of Changzhi brand bearings was too poor. The inner and outer diameters of bearings of the same number were different, so the thickness of the axles had to be processed separately according to the inner diameter of each bearing, and the inner diameter of the flange also had to be processed separately according to the outer diameter of each bearing. This made the assembly labor-intensive and time-consuming. The workers called these bearings "match-the-number" bearings.

The Tangshan Transportation Electrical Equipment Company inspected 2,102 sets of two types of bearings, No. 462 and No. 3984, and found that only 354 sets met the minimum specifications. The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Transportation Electrical Equipment Company also conducted a detailed inspection and proved that the product specifications of Changzhi brand bearings did not meet the standards, making them difficult to sell and use.

This year, the total number of agricultural loan rubber-tired cart undercarriages nationwide is 150,000, requiring a total of 600,000 bearings, and Changzhi brand bearings account for a large proportion of these. Therefore, substandard Changzhi brand bearings will affect the loan distribution of rubber-tired carts in many regions. If such bearings are installed on carts and loaned to farmers, it will be difficult to find a replacement even with Changzhi brand bearings of the same number if a bearing breaks down. I believe that the Changzhi Bearing Factory in Shanxi should actively improve product quality, unify specification standards, and produce excellent bearings to meet the needs of the peasant masses.

### 长治牌轴承质量很差

    长治牌轴承质量很差编辑同志：
    河北省唐山市交通电工器材公司在1955年第四季度委托唐山、天津两市的几个机器厂装配一部分全套的马车下脚。这些马车下脚所用的轴承，都是山西长治轴承厂的产品。在装配的过程中，发现长治牌轴承的质量太坏，同一号码的轴承内外口径的大小都不一样，以致车轴两端的粗细必须按照每个轴承的内径来分别加工，法兰盘的内径也得按照每个轴承外径的大小来分别加工。这样，装配起来费工费时，工人们都把这种轴承叫做“对号入座”型轴承。
    唐山市交通电工器材公司对462号和3984号两种轴承（共2，102盘）进行了检查，结果合乎最低规格标准的只有354盘。中国交通电工器材公司天津采购供应站经过详细查验以后，也证明长治牌轴承的产品规格不合标准，很难销售和使用。
    今年全国农贷胶轮大车下脚的总数是15万辆，一共需要60万盘轴承，其中所用的长治牌轴承占很大数量。因此，长治牌轴承不合规格就会影响很多地区胶轮大车的贷放工作。如果把这样的轴承按装在大车上贷给农民，一个轴承坏了以后，就是用同一号码的长治牌轴承也不容易配上。我认为，山西长治轴承厂应该积极地提高产品质量，统一规格标准，生产优良的轴承来供应农民群众的需要。
