    At the Foot of the Tianshan Mountains
    Bi Ye
    Since winter began, the Tianshan Mountains have become whiter day by day. The undulating, snow-covered peaks easily remind one of the long white silk skirts that flutter when Uyghur girls dance.

    Comrade Li Bin and I were riding our horses to an agricultural cooperative at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains. The winter sun was warm, so we loosened the reins and let the horses slowly follow a river.

    Ice floes were flowing in the river, drifting downstream in chunks, rotating, colliding, and making rustling sounds. Along the river was a vast winter pasture, with golden reeds and gray-white yurts shimmering in the sun. Everywhere were herds of fat horses and sheep of various colors, some lowering their heads to graze, others lying quietly in the open spaces between the grass, basking in the sun.

    Li Bin raised his whip and said to me, "Those herds also include the livestock of the Red Star Cooperative."

    Li Bin was very familiar with this area. He was a platoon leader and Party branch committee member of a certain division of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. After the troops entered Xinjiang, he led farmers in this area in reducing rent and interest. In recent years, he had been assigned by the troops to be a technical instructor for agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams in this area. Before I met him, I had heard in the division headquarters that he had put a lot of effort into the collectivization movement of the ethnic minority farmers in this area. In the past, when spring came, the farmers here were not in a hurry to sow; they waited until the oleaster trees bloomed before going to the fields. And when they did, they rode horses and scattered seeds, which not only wasted the farming season but also disregarded sowing techniques, resulting in uneven seedlings and poor harvests. It took Li Bin a lot of effort to persuade them to sow early and practice row sowing. In the beginning, they just followed their old habits and sowed ten or eight catties per mu. Li Bin had to personally mark out one mu of land and sow more than 20 catties of seeds himself, and he put up wooden signs to mark it. As a result, this one mu of land yielded double the harvest...

    Suddenly, a horse neighed in the distance. A black horse waded across the river, with a person clinging tightly to its back, feet off the stirrups. The black horse had already reached the middle of the river, and waves kept hitting the saddle.

    Li Bin reined in his horse, raised his hand to shield the sunlight, stared into the river for a while, and then turned back to me, saying happily:

    "It's Maimaiti, the head of the Red Star Cooperative, he must be taking a shortcut back from the district."

    The black horse had reached the shallow water and was still ten or so zhang away from the riverbank. The rider, wearing a cylindrical sheepskin hat, had just straightened up on the horse's back when he spotted us. He waved his hand vigorously and shouted Li Bin's name.

    The black horse finally broke the thin ice at the riverbank and jumped ashore, rushing straight up to us. Maimaiti reached out his thick, large palm from the horse. When I shook his hand, it was the first time in my life I had encountered such a strong grip.

    We walked side by side along the road. Maimaiti and Li Bin kept talking and laughing. His gestures and expressions made me feel that he was a hearty Uyghur elder. But Li Bin asked me, "How old do you think he is? 50? No, only in his 30s!"

    I turned my head to look at Maimaiti in surprise. At that moment, I suddenly noticed that the area under his chin, between his graying sideburns, was bare.

    Li Bin noticed my gaze and, in an angry tone, told me that Maimaiti's beard symbolized the tragic fate of the farmers in this area in the past. Two years before liberation, a local tyrant seized the land of the farmers in this area. His three magic weapons for dealing with the farmers were whips, wolf-tooth clubs, and guns given to him by the Kuomintang. He forced the farmers to cultivate the land for him for free, and the farmers were only allowed to catch fish in the river in the summer and grill them on stone slabs to eat, and to dig up grass roots at the foot of the mountains in the winter to fill their hunger. One day, Maimaiti was digging up grass roots on a hillside when he happened to see the local tyrant passing by with his henchmen. He ran up, blocked the horse, and demanded that the local tyrant return some grain to the farmers. The local tyrant was stunned for a moment, and then immediately ordered Maimaiti to be tied up. Then he personally tied Maimaiti's beard to a stick, stuck the stick in the ground, and laughed and rode off. Maimaiti could not move. The mountains were vast, and there was no one in sight. With tears of grief and anger, Maimaiti finally endured the pain and tore off a lock of his beard. The place where the beard was torn off at that time is the scar that is now left on his chin.

    In 1949, Xinjiang was liberated. The following year, Maimaiti applied to join the Communist Party of China.

    "The Party rescued us from hell and led us onto the path of light," Maimaiti said in a loud voice. "Now we follow the Party every step of the way, and we do everything according to what Chairman Mao says."

    Then, he pointed to the vast fields in front with his horse whip and said, "We have now connected the land into one piece, and we have started using horse-drawn machines. See? Ahead is the Ukrainian winter wheat sown in the autumn, and further ahead, that dark area used to be a reed lake, the peat is decomposed and oily, and more cotton will be planted there in the spring."

    "The Red Star Cooperative must have a lot of land, right?" I asked with a feeling of satisfaction.

    "3,600 mu," Li Bin replied happily. "Plus the land of the two mutual aid teams that joined the cooperative after the autumn harvest, there are a total of 5,200 mu."

    "The average yield of cotton is 200 jin per mu, and wheat is 300 jin plus a bit, not worse than inside the pass, right?" Maimaiti laughed heartily.

    Suddenly, a crisp cry and the sound of copper bells came from the reeds taller than the horses. We immediately saw a group of small donkeys carrying fertilizer bags running out of a small path in the middle of the grass.

    "Rezi Muhani!" Before seeing anyone, Maimaiti shouted into the grass. With Maimaiti's shout, a nimble shadow flashed out of the dense reeds onto the road. It was a petite Uyghur girl. She jumped to Li Bin's horse, enthusiastically grabbed his hand, and laughed loudly, but when she discovered me, the new guest, she became restrained and bowed to me with her long braids hanging down.

    Maimaiti briefly said something to her. This time, she didn't care about my presence, and turned around and pounced on Li Bin, skillfully grabbing the horse's bridle, talking and laughing with Li Bin, until Maimaiti reminded her that the donkeys had gone far away. Then she laughed and ran off to chase her donkeys.

    "Maimaiti told her that I will be stationed in the cooperative," Li Bin winked. "Can't tell, right? She's a production team leader!"

    He continued, this girl named Rezi Muhani is an excellent member of the Communist Youth League. She can turn the most backward women into activists. During the tense stage of spring plowing and sowing, she carried other people's nursing babies to the fields to work, and even moved the most reluctant mothers of the past to follow her to the fields. In the winter, she transported more than 200,000 jin of fertilizer herself. Under her leadership, her production team overfulfilled the task of transporting 2 million jin of fertilizer, which created a high-yield record of an average of 290 jin of cotton flowers per mu and an average of 410 jin of wheat per mu on her team's cotton and wheat fields.

    "We're here," Li Bin said, pointing with his horse whip to a patch of poplar forest shining silver in the sunlight in the distance and the houses built along both sides of the road in front of us, saying that those were the homes of the members of the Red Star Cooperative, which had just been completed. At the entrance of the village, across the road, there were two relatively large buildings on the left and right, all painted white, each with a five-star red flag flying above it.

    "That's the supply and marketing cooperative and the purchasing station," Li Bin pointed to the building on the left, and then moved his finger to the one on the right, "That's..."

    "The primary school!" I said with a smile.

    "That's right," Li Bin nodded. "This is the first primary school here, and children from all around are flying here like bees collecting honey, and half of them are children from the Red Star Cooperative."

    When we dismounted in the village, people quickly gathered around. Li Bin shook hands with the first person who came up, a tall young man with thick curly hair and determined eyes. He held Li Bin's hand tightly and wouldn't let go for a long time. This young man looked familiar, as if I had met him somewhere, but I couldn't remember for a moment. After Li Bin introduced him, I remembered that this young man was a famous agricultural machinery operator, and I had seen his photo in a pictorial. He was an A-level labor model of the autonomous prefecture, and his name was Shawuti.

    Shawuti led us to see the ten-row horse-drawn seeder, the horse-drawn harvester, and several new-style plows that he was repairing for storage.

    Shawuti spoke very good Mandarin. He lovingly stroked the agricultural machinery and said to me:

    "With this seeder, the crops will sprout neatly and evenly. Our hoes have been replaced with new-style plows, and the sickles have been replaced with this horse-drawn harvester."

    During the summer harvest the year before last, Shawuti went to visit the People's Liberation Army farm and saw tractors and combine harvesters for the first time. When the tractor pulling the No. 6 combine harvester suddenly started, he was so startled that he turned around and ran; later, when he heard the sound of the machine was far away and not so deafening, he turned back again. He saw the moving scene of the combine harvester cutting wheat, and he couldn't help but be attracted and followed it for half a day in the scorching sun. When the tractor stopped, he suddenly lay down in front of it, stretched out his limbs, and didn't want to leave.

    So when the cooperative got its first horse-drawn harvester, he volunteered to learn how to use it; when the cooperative got its first new-style plow, he volunteered to learn how to use the new-style plow. Later, he also learned how to use the horse-drawn seeder.

    Last spring, the seeder driven by Shawuti had already finished sowing the spring wheat fields of the Red Star Cooperative, but the fields of the mutual aid team across a ridge had not yet been sown with even a single wheat seed. The mutual aid team had few people and poor tools, and they couldn't manage it.

    "Brother Shawuti, please lend us your seeder!" The leader of the mutual aid team ran over breathlessly, white steam rising from his forehead after he took off his leather hat.

    "This is a machine, it's not as easy to use as your hand-cranked wooden drill. Put your seeds at the end of the field," Shawuti said, reining in his horse.

    Shawuti sowed spring wheat for the mutual aid team overnight, and the head of the cooperative, Maimaiti, personally held a storm lantern in front to lead the horse.

    The leader of the mutual aid team was so moved that he slaughtered a sheep for Shawuti and Maimaiti and lit a bonfire in the field to roast mutton for them, but Shawuti and Maimaiti didn't eat it.

    After the autumn harvest, the fields had to be irrigated in the autumn. The land of the mutual aid team was close to the lower side of the Red Star Cooperative, and a canal ran from the land of the Red Star Cooperative to the land of the mutual aid team. The Red Star Cooperative let the water go to the lower mutual aid team first. When the head of the cooperative, Maimaiti, and the cooperative members, with their lower bodies bare, were in the canal water letting the water into the land of the mutual aid team, the leader of the mutual aid team immediately convened a meeting of the whole team and elected representatives to rush to the district overnight. The next morning, the representatives and a district cadre returned from the district. The leader of the mutual aid team immediately carried a hoe and led the people in the team to beat gongs and drums to the fields. The leader of the mutual aid team took the lead in leveling the boundary between the mutual aid team and the Red Star Cooperative, and then beat the gongs and drums happily with the district cadre to deliver the approval letter from the district to the Red Star Cooperative.

    When this mutual aid team joined the Red Star Cooperative, another mutual aid team immediately requested to join.

    "Now our Red Star Cooperative is a big cooperative. In another year or two, we will transform into a collective farm, and I should learn how to use tractors and combine harvesters!"

    Laughter came from somewhere. Li Bin and I turned around and saw that it was from the doorway of a nearby house, where a group of women wearing flat fox fur hats and wrapping soft woolen headscarves were selecting seeds in the sun. I don't know when Maimaiti ran over to their side. He was talking and laughing with them.

    天山脚下
    碧野
    入冬以来，天山一天比一天变得更白，起伏的积雪的峰峦，很容易使人联想起维吾尔族少女起舞时飘曳的白绫长裙。
    我和李斌同志骑着马，正往那天山脚下的一个农业合作社去。冬天的阳光暖暖地晒着，我们放松缰绳，让马儿慢慢地顺着一条河边走。
    河里在流冰凌，成块的冰凌满河往下漂，旋转着，碰击着，发出一阵阵嚓嚓的声音。沿河是一片辽阔的冬牧场，金黄色的芨芨草和灰白的蒙古包在太阳下闪烁。到处有成群的各种毛色的肥壮马羊，有的在低着头吃草，有的伏在草间的空地上静静地晒太阳。
    李斌把鞭子一扬，对我说：“那些牧群里也有红星社的牲口。”
    李斌对这一带是非常熟悉的。他是新疆农业生产建设部队某师的一个排长，连的党支部委员。在部队进入新疆以后，他就在这一带领导过农民减租减息，这几年来，他一直被部队指派做这一带的农业合作社和互助组的技术指导员。在没有认识他以前，我在师部就听说他对这一带少数民族农民的合作化运动花了不少心血。过去，每当春天来到的时候，这里的农民不忙着播种，他们要等沙枣树开花的时候才下地；下了地，也是骑着马撒种，既误农时，又不讲究播种技术，出的苗不齐，收获很少。李斌好不容易才说服他们提前播种和实行条播。开始，他们也只是按着老习惯每亩播上十斤八斤，李斌不得不亲自划出一亩地，亲自动手播上20几斤种籽，并且插上了木牌做记号，结果他这一亩地得到了加倍的收成……。
    忽然，远处传来一声马嘶。河里趟过来一匹黑马，有一个人把身子紧贴在马背后，两脚离蹬。黑马已经趟到河心，浪花不住地打到马鞍上。
    李斌勒住马，举起手掌遮住阳光，往河里凝视了一阵，然后回过头来高兴地对我说：
    “是红星社的社长买买提，准是抄近道从区上回来的。”
    黑马已经到了浅水滩，离河岸还有十来丈远。戴着一顶筒形羊皮帽的骑者刚刚从马背上直起身子来，就发现了我们，他使劲地挥着手，高喊着李斌的名字。
    黑马终于踩碎河边的薄冰，跳上岸来，一下子冲到我们的跟前。买买提在马上伸过来他的又粗又大的手掌，当我和他握手的时候，我平生第一次碰上这样大的手劲。
    我们并辔沿着大路走。买买提同李斌不住笑着说着。他的手势，他的表情，处处都使我觉得他是一个爽朗的维吾尔族老人。可是李斌却问我：“你猜他年纪多大？50吗？不，才30几！”
    我诧异地转过头去看了看买买提，就在这个时候，我忽然发现他连鬓的花白胡子中间的下巴那一块是光的。
    李斌注意到我的眼光，就用一种愤怒的声调对我说起，买买提这把胡子表明了这一带农民往日的悲惨命运。解放前两年，一个恶霸地主霸占了这一带农民的土地，他对待农民的三件法宝就是皮鞭、狼牙棒和国民党送给他的枪。他逼着农民白白给他种地，农民们只被准许夏天在河里捞鱼用石板烤来吃，冬天在山脚挖草根充饥。有一天，买买提在一片山坡下挖草根，恰巧看见恶霸地主领着他的爪牙们经过。他就跑上去，拦住马，要恶霸地主把粮交还一些给农民。恶霸地主楞了一下，立即就恶狠狠地命令把买买提背缚起来，然后又亲手把买买提的胡子缚在一根棍子上，把棍子往地里一插，就哈哈地笑着上马走掉了。买买提当时动弹不得。山野茫茫，连个人影也没有。买买提含着悲愤的眼泪，终于忍着疼，扯掉了他的一绺胡子。当时扯掉胡子的地方就是现在留在他下巴上的那块斑痕。
    1949年新疆解放，第二年买买提就要求参加了中国共产党。
    “党把我们从地狱里救出来，把我们领上光明大道。”买买提说话的声音很宏亮，“现在我们每一步都跟着党走，每一件事都照着毛主席说的话办。”
    接着，他用马鞭指着前面广阔的田地，说：“我们现在已经把土地连成一片，已经使用上了马拉机子。看见么？前面是秋播的乌克兰冬麦，再往前，那黑黑的原先是苇湖地，草泥炭腐熟，多油，春天就要在那里种上更多的棉花。”
    “红星社的地一定很多吧？”我怀着一种美满的心情问。
    “3，600亩。”李斌快活地回答：“再加上秋后入社的两个互助组的地，合共就有5，200来亩了。”
    “棉花平均每亩产量200斤，麦子300挂零，不比关里差吧？”买买提爽朗地笑起来。
    忽然一阵清脆的叫声和一阵铜铃声从高过马头的芨芨草丛里传出来，我们立即就看见从草丛中间的一条小路上，奔出来成群驮着肥料袋子的小毛驴。
    “热衣木汗！”还没有看见人影，买买提就往草丛里喊。随着买买提的喊声，一个灵巧的影子从密密的芨芨草中间闪出大路上来了。这是一个身材娇小的维吾尔族姑娘。她跳到李斌的马跟前，热情地拉住他的手，大声笑着，但当她发现我这个新来的客人的时候，就拘束起来，垂下长长的辫子向我鞠了一躬。
    买买提简短的跟她说了几句什么话，这次她却顾不得我在场，一回身就扑向李斌，熟练地抓住了马嚼子，跟李斌又是说又是笑，一直到买买提提醒她毛驴已经走远了，她这才笑着跑掉，追赶她的毛驴去了。
    “买买提告诉她我要驻在社里的事。”李斌眨着眼睛，“看不出来吧，她是个生产队长哩！”
    他接着说，这个叫做热衣木汗的姑娘，是优秀的青年团员。她能够使最落后的妇女变成积极分子，春耕播种那个紧张阶段，她替别人背着吃奶的孩子下地干活，把往日最不肯劳动的母亲也感动得跟着她下了地。冬天运肥，她个人就运了20多万斤，在她的带动下，她的生产队超额完成了200万斤运肥的任务，这就造成她队里的棉花地平均每亩收花290斤，小麦地平均每亩收410斤的大田丰产纪录。
    “到了。”李斌用马鞭指着远远的一片在阳光下闪着银辉的白杨林和前面顺着大路两旁建筑的房子，说那就是红星社社员们的住家，才完工的。在村口，隔着大路，左右有两座比较大的建筑物，一色粉白，每座上空都飘着一面五星红旗。
    “那是供销社和收购站。”李斌指着左面的一座建筑物，然后又把手指移向右面的一座，“那是……”
    “小学！”我笑着说。
    “就是，”李斌点了点头，“这里有了第一座小学，四近的孩子们都像蜜蜂采蜜似的飞来了，当中有一半是红星社的孩子。”
    当我们在村子里下马的时候，很快就有人围拢过来了。李斌跟第一个走上来的人握手，这是一个长着浓密的卷发，有着一对刚毅的眼睛的高个子年轻人。他紧紧地握着李斌的手，老半天都不肯放。这年轻人看来很面熟，好像我在什么地方跟他见过面，可是一时又想不起来。经李斌一介绍，我才想起这个年轻人是一个有名的农机手，曾经在画报上看见过他的照片。他是自治州的甲等劳动模范，名字叫沙吾提。
    沙吾提领着我们去看他正在修理入库的一架十行马拉播种机、一架马拉收割机和几张新式犁。
    沙吾提的汉话说得很好。他心爱地抚摸着农机对我说：
    “有了这播种机，庄稼苗就出得齐齐整整的了。我们的砍土镘已经换成了新式犁，镰刀也已经换成了这马拉收割机。”
    前年夏收时候，沙吾提去参观解放军农场的时候，第一次看见拖拉机和联合收割机。当牵引着6号联合收割机的拖拉机突然发动的那一会儿，他大吃一惊，扭头就跑；后来听听机器声远了，不怎么震耳了，才又拐回来。他看见联合收割机割麦子的动人情景，不由得就被吸引了跟着走，而且整整在火热的太阳下跟了半天。等到拖拉机一停火，他忽然往它跟前一躺，伸展四肢，再也不想走开了。
    于是当社里有了第一架马拉收割机的时候，他就争着学使收割机；当社里有了第一张新式犁的时候，他就争着学使新式犁。以后他又学会了使用马拉播种机。
    去年春上，沙吾提驾驶的播种机已经把红星社的春麦地播完了，可是隔着一条田坎的互助组的地里却连一粒麦种也还没有播下。互助组人少工具差，忙不过来。
    “沙吾提老弟，把你们的播种机借给我们使一使吧！”互助组组长气喘喘地跑过来，摘掉皮帽子的脑门上蒸腾着白花花的汗气。
    “这是机器，可不像你们那手摇木耧那么容易使唤。把你们的种籽放到地头上来吧。”沙吾提说着勒回马头来。
    沙吾提连夜给互助组播春麦，社长买买提就亲自提着一盏风雨灯在前面拉马。
    互助组组长感动得给沙吾提和买买提宰了一只羊，就在地头上烧起一堆篝火给他俩烤羊肉，但是沙吾提和买买提都没有吃。
    秋收以后，地里要秋灌，互助组的地紧靠在红星社的下边，一条水渠正从红星社的地里贯穿到互助组的地里去，红星社把水先让给下边的互助组，当社长买买提和社员们光着下半截身子，在渠水里把水放到互助组的地里去的时候，互助组组长立即召集了全组人开会，推选代表连夜赶到区上去。第二天一早代表们和一个区干部从区上回来了，互助组组长立即扛着砍土镘，领着组里的人敲锣打鼓到了地里。互助组组长带头把互助组和红星社中间的地界平了，然后就又敲打着锣鼓欢天喜地的跟着区干部，把区上的批准书送到红星社去。
    当这一个互助组加入了红星社以后，紧接着另一个互助组也要求参加了进来。
    “现在我们红星社是个大社啦，再过一两年，我们就要转为集体农庄，我该学使拖拉机和联合收割机啦！”
    什么地方传来了笑声，我和李斌回头一看，原来是附近的一家门口，有一群戴着扁的狐皮帽和包着柔软的毛织头巾的妇女们在太阳下选种。不知道买买提什么时候跑到她们那边去了，他正在跟她们说说笑笑的。
