    Changlongshan Iron Mine Enters Production
    The Changlongshan Iron Mine in Anhui Province was put into production on January 25th. From now on, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant will receive a steady supply of the ore it needs. The ore from Changlongshan Iron Mine has little slag, low sulfur and phosphorus content, and contains calcium oxide, making it a good raw material for direct steelmaking. The Changlongshan Iron Mine suffered long-term plunder and destruction by Japanese imperialism. Reconstruction began last June, and now a mechanized open-pit iron mine has been completed.

    长龙山铁矿投入生产
    安徽省长龙山铁矿已经在1月25日投入生产。从此，马鞍山铁厂所需要的矿石将得到源源供应。长龙山铁矿的矿石渣质少，硫磷低微，含有氧化钙，是直接用以炼钢的好原料。长龙山铁矿曾遭受日本帝国主义的长期掠夺和破坏，去年6月开始重建，现在已经建成一座机械化的露天铁矿。
