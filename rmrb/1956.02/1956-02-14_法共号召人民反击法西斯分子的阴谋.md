Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 13th (TASS): The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement exposing the criminal activities of the fascists, saying that the government's concessions to the colonialists' demonstrations in Algeria not long ago encouraged the fascists, and their accomplices in Paris planned to hold demonstrations in the French capital on February 11th.

The statement pointed out that the Political Bureau agreed with the government's decision to prohibit fascist gatherings and demonstrations in Paris, but it regretted that the government also prohibited the anti-demonstrations that various parties and groups intended to hold to defend freedom and the republican system.

The statement said, "The working people of the Paris region and all democrats will not allow the warmongers of Algeria to force the implementation of their policies through riots and take revenge for their failure in the elections."

The statement called on all Communists, all Socialists, and all those who advocate a republican system to unite closely. The statement mentioned the proposal made by the Communist Party's Seine Province organization to the Socialist Party's Seine Province branch regarding unified action, and emphasized that unified action is the most reliable way to doom the fascists' conspiracy to failure.

The Political Bureau suggested that all organizations of the Communist Party immediately establish contact with the organizations of the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party in order to jointly combat fascism in Paris and other cities in the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 11th (TASS): French progressive newspapers pointed out that the fascist demonstration originally scheduled to be held in Paris in recent days but later banned by the authorities was initiated by a group of reactionary groups closely linked to the colonialists. For example, the so-called "Coordination Committee of Veterans Defending the French Federation, France, and the French Army" issued a statement on February 9th, calling on all its members to gather at Edouard Square on February 11th to hold a demonstration to defend "French sovereignty in Algeria." Among the leaders of this committee are a group of French retired generals, as well as many people who participated in the Indochina colonial war and representatives of many right-wing organizations. Members of the so-called "Poujade Movement" also intended to actively participate in this planned demonstration.

The democratic public believes that this conspiracy by the reactionaries is a new fascist threat to the republican system and the democratic achievements of the French people. The Seine Province Committee and Seine-et-Oise Province Committee of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, a group of well-known members of parliament from the Radical Socialist Party, as well as the Seine Province Committee of this party, the National Association of Former French Resistance Fighters, and other left-wing organizations have all issued calls to resist the reactionaries.

    法共号召人民反击法西斯分子的阴谋
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎13日讯　法国共产党政治局发表声明，揭露法西斯分子的罪恶行动说，政府对不久前殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚举行的示威所作的让步鼓励了法西斯主义者，于是他们在巴黎的同党就打算于2月11日在法国首都举行示威。
    声明指出，政治局赞同政府关于禁止法西斯分子在巴黎集会示威的决定，但是它对于政府同样也禁止各党派团体为了保卫自由和共和国制度而打算举行的反抗示威感到遗憾。
    声明说，“巴黎区的劳动人民和所有民主人士不会允许阿尔及利亚的战争鼓吹者通过骚乱来强迫执行自己的政策和由于自己在选举中的失败而进行报复。”
    声明号召所有共产党人、所有社会党人和所有主张共和政体的人紧紧地团结起来。声明谈到共产党塞纳省组织向社会党塞纳省支部提出的关于行动一致的建议，并且着重指出，行动一致是注定法西斯分子的阴谋遭受失败的最可靠的方法。
    政治局建议共产党的所有组织立即同社会党和激进社会党的组织建立联系，以便共同抗击巴黎和国内其他城市的法西斯主义。
    新华社讯　塔斯社巴黎11日电：法国进步报纸指出，原定最近几天在巴黎举行而后来被当局禁止的法西斯示威游行是由一批反动集团发起的，这些人同殖民主义者有密切的联系。例如，所谓“退伍军人保卫法兰西联邦、法国和法国军队协调委员会”在2 月9日发表声明，号召它的全体成员在2月11日在埃杜瓦尔广场集合，举行保卫“法国在阿尔及利亚主权”的示威。这个委员会的领导人中有一批法国退伍将军，还有许多曾经参加印度支那殖民战争的人和许多右翼组织的代表。所谓“布热德运动”的成员也打算积极参加这次预定的示威。
    民主公众认为反动派这一阴谋是对共和制度和法国人民的民主果实的新的法西斯威胁。共产党、社会党的塞纳省委员会和塞纳—瓦斯省委员会、激进社会党一批著名的议员以及这个党的塞纳省委员会、前法国抵抗运动战士全国协会和其他左派组织都为此发出了抗击反动派的号召。
