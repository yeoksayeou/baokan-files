Artists to Design 60 Novel Garments

Sixty novel garment styles will be designed by Beijing artists before February 20th. These garment styles are mainly designed for young women and children. The design principles are beauty, economy, and practicality.

On the 11th, artists in Beijing participated in a garment design discussion. They decided to begin immediately, with each person designing at least 5 garment patterns before the 20th, and then selecting the 60 best ones to promote. The artists also decided to go to Shanghai to invite a group of highly skilled seamstresses to Beijing, where they will be guided by the artists who designed the patterns to sew samples. These samples will be exhibited at the garment exhibition to be held in Beijing in March this year.

The artists pointed out that the design of beautiful garments should also take into account the shape of the person, for example, what style of garment is suitable for slender people, and what style of garment is suitable for plump people.

The artists participating in this design work include artists Zhang Guangyu, Yu Feng, teachers from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, stage costume design experts from the Central Song and Dance Troupe, and 14 others.

    美术家将设计60种新颖服装
    60种新颖的服装式样在2月20日以前将由北京的美术家们设计出来。这些服装式样主要是为青年妇女和儿童设计的。设计的原则是美观、经济、适用。
    11日，在北京的美术家参加了服装设计讨论会。他们决定立刻开始行动，在20日以前每人至少设计出5种服装图样，再从这里面选出60种最好的来推广。美术家们还决定到上海去请一批技术精良的缝纫师到北京来，由设计图样的美术家指导他们缝制样品。今年3月间在北京举行的服装展览会将要展出这些样品。
    美术家们提出，设计美的服装还要考虑到人的体型，例如什么式样的服装适合身材苗条的人穿，什么式样的服装适合身体肥硕的人穿。
    参加这项设计工作的有美术家张光宇、郁风和中央美术学院的教师、中央歌舞团的舞台服装设计专家等14人。
