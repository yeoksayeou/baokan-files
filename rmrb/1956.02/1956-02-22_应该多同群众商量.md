We Should Consult with the Masses More

　　Chenglixiang in the Second District of Yishan County, Guangxi Province, is a place that often suffers from drought. The farmers in this township had long wanted to divert water from the Longtougou (Dragon Head Gully) to eliminate the threat of drought. When formulating the production plan, the township's Party branch included the construction of the Longtougou water conservancy project as a major measure to increase production.

　　Soon, the Yishan Prefectural Commissioner's Office sent two staff members from the Water Conservancy Section to survey Longtougou. They stayed in the village for two days, looked at the terrain, and hastily concluded: "The water level of Longtougou is too low, the water cannot be diverted, and the project cannot be done."

　　Could the Longtougou project be built or not? Many farmers in this township had herded cattle and cut grass near Longtougou since they were young, and they were very familiar with the terrain of every mountain and gully. After their research with the Party branch, they overturned the conclusion that "water cannot be diverted." The Party branch requested the Yishan County Water Conservancy Section to send people to re-survey, and finally found a 46-li (Chinese mile) long canal route. After the completion of this project, it is estimated that it can develop 2,300 mu (Chinese acre) of paddy fields.

　　This fact shows that in the process of helping and guiding the masses in building water conservancy projects, the staff of the water conservancy department must consult with the local masses more and listen to their opinions in order to avoid mistakes of being divorced from reality and divorced from the masses.

    应该多同群众商量
    广西宜山县二区城立乡是个常受旱的地方。这个乡的农民老早就想把龙头沟的水引过来，消除干旱威胁。在制定生产规划的时候，乡的党支部就把兴修龙头沟的水利工程作为一项主要的增产措施。
    不久，宜山专署水利科派了两位工作人员来勘测龙头沟。他们在村里住了两天，看了看地势，便轻率地作出了结论：“龙头沟的水位太低，河水引不过来，工程做不得。”
    龙头沟工程能不能兴修呢？这个乡的许多农民从小就在龙头沟附近放过牛，打过草，非常清楚每一个山岭和水沟的地势。经过他们和党支部的研究，推翻了“水引不过来”的结论。党支部请求宜山县水利科派人重新勘测，终于找到了一条长达46里的水渠路线。这项工程修成后，估计可以发展2，300亩水田。
    这个事实说明，水利部门的工作人员在帮助和指导群众兴修水利工程的过程中，必须多同当地群众商量，听取群众的意见，这样才能避免脱离实际、脱离群众的错误。
