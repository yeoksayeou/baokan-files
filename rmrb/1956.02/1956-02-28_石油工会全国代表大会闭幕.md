Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The first National Congress of the Chinese Petroleum Workers' Union, held in Beijing, concluded today. The conference formally elected and established the National Committee of the Chinese Petroleum Workers' Union, composed of 40 members including Zhang Zhaomei and Walis; and also defined the current basic tasks of the Chinese Petroleum Workers' Union. The conference called on trade union organizations at all levels to better unite and organize the masses of workers and staff in the petroleum industry, fully carry out socialist emulation campaigns, and strive to complete the production and construction tasks of the petroleum industry in the first five-year plan ahead of schedule; and to regularly care for and improve the working conditions and material and cultural life of the workers and staff.

The conference believes that the central link for trade union organizations at all levels to lead the socialist emulation campaign is to widely carry out the advanced producer movement in the petroleum industry system. It requires every worker and staff member to adopt advanced working methods, fully break through the current quotas, and make this movement a driving force for promoting all work.

Representatives from units such as the Yumen Oilfield Refinery, the Cracking Workshop of the Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 5, and the First Construction and Installation Engineering Company of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, on behalf of the workers and staff of their respective units, proposed an initiative to carry out inter-factory emulation campaigns to workers and staff in similar enterprises across the country. The 52 representatives who spoke at the meeting unanimously agreed with their proposal.

During the conference, Zhang Zhaomei, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Petroleum Workers' Union, and Li Jukui, Minister of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, made reports to the attending representatives on the work of the trade union and the basic situation of the petroleum industry.

On the last day of the conference, the attending representatives passed a letter of salute to Chairman Mao and unanimously adopted a resolution on carrying out the advanced producer movement in the petroleum industry system.
