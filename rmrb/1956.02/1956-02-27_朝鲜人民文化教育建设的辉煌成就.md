Brilliant Achievements of Cultural and Educational Construction of the Korean People
Wei Que, Head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation to Korea

Although the Chinese Cultural Delegation's visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea lasted only one month, we gained a great deal through extensive contact and in-depth understanding of the Korean cultural and educational circles.

First of all, we have a deeper understanding of the close and profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. China and Korea have a long history of cultural relations. In the revolutionary struggle for national liberation, the people of China and Korea have continuously supported and helped each other, developing the traditional friendship on a new basis. Since the people of the two countries gained liberation under different historical conditions, the friendship between the two peoples has been further developed under the leadership of the working-class parties. In particular, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought side by side to resist the aggression of the American imperialists, and after the armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteers and Chinese technical workers assisted in Korea's reconstruction work, which further developed and consolidated the friendship between the two peoples on a broad mass basis.

During the visit, we were warmly welcomed and kindly received by Korean comrades everywhere, heard many moving stories about Sino-Korean friendship, and saw many signs of Sino-Korean friendship—all of which made us deeply realize that there is a particularly close and profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Korea is at the forefront of defending peace, democracy, and socialism in the Far East, and the troops of the American imperialists are still occupying the southern half of the Korean territory. After visiting Panmunjom, we have a very deep understanding of the position and role Korea plays in the struggle to defend peace. Therefore, we have a deeper understanding of the great international political significance of the friendship, unity, and cooperation between the Chinese and Korean people.

Secondly, through this visit, we have a relatively in-depth understanding of the achievements of Korea's reconstruction, especially the achievements of cultural and educational construction, and have learned a lot. Korea suffered severe damage during the war: there were many bomb craters along the railway lines; broken bridges and remnants of structures, and destroyed houses could still be seen in areas where the war was fierce. Despite this, the heroic and hardworking Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, are carrying out reconstruction work at an astonishing speed. The capital city of Pyongyang has been built up and become a beautiful metropolis. The Pyongyang United Textile Factory has been rebuilt with the generous help of the Soviet Union. The factories in Chongjin have been restored, and the rebuilt shipyard is larger than before the war.

Now let's talk about the achievements in cultural and educational construction.

1.  Writing Reform　Korean comrades told us that they have used Chinese characters for about 1,700 years, and about 80% or more of the Korean vocabulary comes from Chinese. Compared with Chinese, Korean is a language of a different system, and the grammar is completely different. The difficulty in writing, recognizing, and remembering Chinese characters, as well as the contradictions with the Korean language, have brought great difficulties to the working people in learning culture. Therefore, Korean progressives have long felt the need to reform the writing system.

513 years ago, in 1443 AD, King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty, with the assistance of scholars such as Seong Sammun, Shin Sukju, and Jeong Inji, created the Korean phonetic alphabet. Before liberation, mainly due to political constraints, this phonetic alphabet could not be promoted to the masses. Since liberation, Korea has been using the phonetic alphabet completely since 1948. All official documents, textbooks, newspapers, magazines, books, inscriptions, signs, etc., have all been changed to use the phonetic alphabet.

This reform has played a huge role in eliminating illiteracy, enriching the content of primary school education, improving the quality of primary school education, shortening the duration of primary school, and improving the cultural level of the people. After switching to the phonetic alphabet, adults only need to study for about 102 hours to be able to read ordinary books and newspapers. The Korean democratic government only spent two years (1947-1949) to basically eliminate 2.57 million illiterate people. However, due to the impact of the war and the expansion of the liberated areas, there are still some relapsed illiterates and new illiterates, most of whom are older and women, and it is expected that they can be eliminated this year.

The change to the phonetic alphabet has also had a great impact on primary school education. The first textbook used in the first grade of Korean primary schools is called "Our Language". After studying this textbook for 3 months, children have preliminary reading and writing skills. On this basis, children then study readers with richer content and more vivid descriptions. There are 82 lessons in this reader, and the number of words in the lessons (calculated in translated Chinese characters) is 412 at most and 51 at least.

As far as the vocabulary mastered by first-grade primary school children is concerned, it is entirely possible for them to study lessons with a large number of words if they are using the phonetic alphabet. The experience of Korean primary school education fully proves this point. Because Chinese characters are difficult to write, recognize, and remember, it is impossible for us to compile a reader as rich in content as the one used in the first grade in Korea.

According to our investigation at Namsan Primary School in Kaesong, children in the second semester of the first grade can read lessons with a considerable number of words; children in the second grade can write simple letters, and the phonetic characters they write are much neater than the Chinese characters written by children of the same grade in our country; children in the third grade can read general newspapers and can write poetry; children in the fourth and fifth grades can understand relatively profound novels and can write better poetry. Because the phonetic alphabet enables primary school students to quickly acquire reading and writing skills, the duration of primary school can be shortened accordingly. From this year, the duration of Korean primary schools will be shortened from 5 years to 4 years. By 1957, the fourth and fifth grades will graduate at the same time, which will free up about 4,000 more teachers and free up more classrooms to enroll more primary school students, which is a favorable condition for implementing compulsory education. All this proves that Korea's change to the phonetic alphabet has a very important role in enriching the content of primary school education, improving the quality of primary school education, and shortening the duration of primary school.

Because illiteracy has been basically eliminated in a very short period of time, it is possible to further improve the cultural level of the people, and therefore the number of publications for the general public to read has increased greatly. Taking newspapers as an example, the two newspapers "Rodong Sinmun" and "Minju Choson" each have a daily circulation of about 70,000 copies. Calculating based on the population of northern North Korea, there is an average of one copy of "Rodong Sinmun" or "Minju Choson" for every 65 people, which is much higher than the ratio of the number of newspapers issued to the population in our country.

2.  Compulsory Education　Before liberation, there were about 2 million school-age children in northern Korea, and only 40% to 45% of them went to school. After liberation, the number of children attending school increased year by year, reaching 1.8 million in 1949. The Korean democratic government originally planned to implement compulsory education in 1950, but it was not implemented due to the outbreak of the war. After the armistice, there were 1.5 million children attending school in 1953; 1.78 million in 1954; and 1.87 million in 1955. From these figures, it can be seen that the number of children attending school is increasing very quickly, and the post-war development is also very fast.

According to a survey on April 17, 1955, the number of school-age children was 2,019,000. The Korean democratic government has decided to implement compulsory education this year. According to the estimation of the Ministry of Education (equivalent to our Ministry of Education), there are no difficulties in terms of teachers and funding. It is worth pointing out that the Korean people have given strong support to children's education even in extremely difficult circumstances. According to the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Education, in addition to contributing labor and materials to build school buildings, the Korean people also automatically donate 700 to 800 million Korean won annually for educational funding. The development of universal education in Democratic Korea is prominent: there are schools everywhere, primary schools in every village, and middle schools in three villages. The number of students in Kaesong accounts for 25% of the total population. These facts show that the Party, the government, and the people of Korea attach great importance to education. Although school facilities are relatively poor, teachers are able to use everything for teaching under extremely difficult conditions. This spirit of hard work is worth learning from.

3.  Art　The Korean people attach great importance to the traditions of national art, boldly developing them through experimentation and creation. From the performances at the art theaters in Pyongyang and the art performances in Chongjin, Kaesong and other places, we can see the unique style and considerable artistic level of Korean national art. The dance dramas compiled by Choi Seung-hee, such as "The Story of Sado Castle", boldly and meticulously absorbed many unrestrained steps of ballet, as well as the martial arts, sleeve-waving, sword dance and other movements in Chinese classical drama, on the basis of carrying forward the excellent traditions of Korean national dance. In the field of classical opera, due to the spirit of bold creation and experimentation by Korean artists, brilliant achievements have also been made, such as "Chunhyangjeon" and "Simcheongjeon". Korean writers have created a large number of works in conjunction with the war to defend the motherland and the struggle for reconstruction, which have greatly encouraged the victory of the war and production. They attach importance to children's literature and have written many works for children. The development of oil painting is very prominent, and we can see oil paintings everywhere. In the Fatherland Liberation War Memorial Hall, we saw a part of the beautiful oil paintings painted by the Korean People's Army.

Korean musicians attach great importance to carrying forward the fine traditions of folk music. On the basis of folk music, they are good at accepting and applying the excellent traditions and experience of Western music. The creation of the opera "Kongjwi and Patjwi" is an attempt to boldly use various methods of Western classical opera on the basis of folk music, and it is very successful. They unanimously believe that it is inappropriate to use purely Western traditional harmony and instrumental orchestration to deal with folk music melodies. In order to promote the characteristics of national music, "Chongjinpo Boat Song" was created on the basis of the nationalization of harmony; "Song of Reconstruction" was created on the basis of the processing of folk music chorus and the combination of orchestral music.

The musicians of the National Art Theater used Western vocalization methods to improve the singing methods of folk songs, such as the introduction of chorus and ensemble in classical operas such as "General Yi Sun-sin" and "Simcheongjeon", which also achieved remarkable achievements. Many improvements have also been made in instrumental accompaniment, such as developing the performance of two or three instruments into an orchestra of more than 30 people. In addition, in order to adapt to the ensemble of large instruments, a series of scientific research and transformation work is also being carried out on the range of national instruments, the expansion of the resonance box, and the accuracy of the pitch of wind instruments. At the same time, the Writers' Union is also conducting various scientific analyses and research on the characteristics of classical music, and has published many works.

In general, the Korean people have not only made great achievements in economic recovery and construction, but also have brilliant achievements in cultural and educational construction. We should further study these achievements, learn from Korean comrades, and further strengthen cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Korea.

    朝鲜人民文化教育建设的辉煌成就
    中国访朝文化代表团团长　韦悫
    中国文化代表团访问朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的时间虽然只有一个月，但是通过跟朝鲜文化教育界的广泛接触和比较深入的了解，我们的收获是相当大的。
    首先我们对中朝两国人民间的亲密和深厚的友谊，有更深刻的体会。中朝两国有悠久的文化历史关系。在民族解放的革命斗争中，中朝两国人民不断地互相支持和帮助，使传统的友谊在新的基础上发展起来了。自从两国人民在不同的历史条件下获得解放后，两国人民的友谊，在工人阶级政党的领导下，又有了新的发展。特别是中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战抵抗美帝国主义者的侵略，停战后中国人民志愿军和中国技术工人协助朝鲜的恢复建设工作，更使两国人民的友谊，在广泛的群众基础上，得到了更进一步的发展和巩固。
    在访问期间，我们到处受到朝鲜同志的热烈欢迎和亲切的接待，听到了许多关于中朝友好的动人故事，看到了许多中朝友好的标志——这一切使我们深刻地体会到，在中朝两国人民之间，存在着特别亲密和深厚的友谊。朝鲜处在保卫远东和平、民主和社会主义事业的最前线，美帝国主义者的军队还侵占着朝鲜国土的南半部。参观了板门店，我们对朝鲜在保卫和平的斗争中所处的地位和所起的作用，有极深刻的认识。由此，我们更深刻地体会到，中朝两国人民的友好、团结、合作是有重大的国际政治意义的。
    其次，通过这次访问，我们对于朝鲜恢复建设的成就，特别是文化教育建设的成就，有比较深入的了解，并且学到了不少东西。朝鲜在战争中遭受了严重的破坏：铁路沿线的弹坑很多；断桥残架，被炸毁的房屋，在战争激烈的地方还可以看到。虽然如此，英雄勤劳的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的领导下，正在以惊人的速度，进行着恢复建设的工作。首都平壤已经兴建起来，成为一个美丽的都市。平壤联合纺织工厂，在苏联慷慨的帮助下，已经重新建设起来了。清津各工厂已经恢复，其中造船厂重建后，比战前规模更大。
    现在分别谈一谈文化教育建设的成就。
    1、文字改革　朝鲜同志告诉我们，他们使用汉字约有1，700多年之久，朝鲜语汇中约有80％以上的词儿是从汉语来的。朝鲜语跟汉语比较，是不同体系的语言，语法是完全两样的。汉字难写、难认、难记以及跟朝鲜语的矛盾，给劳动人民学习文化带来很大的困难。因此，朝鲜进步人士早就感觉到文字有改革的必要。
    在513年前，即公元1443年，李朝世宗王在成三问、申叔舟、郑麟趾等学者的协助之下，创制了朝鲜自己的拼音文字。解放前主要是由于政治条件的限制，这种拼音文字未能推广到群众中去。解放后从1948年开始，朝鲜已完全使用拼音文字。所有公文、教科书、报纸、杂志、图书、碑匾、招牌等等，已经全部改用拼音文字了。
    这个改革对于扫除文盲，丰富小学教育的内容，提高小学教育的质量，缩短小学的年限，提高人民的文化水平，起了巨大的作用。改用拼音文字后，成人只学习约102小时，就能够阅读普通书报，朝鲜民主政府只花了两年时间（1947—1949），便把257万文盲基本上扫除了。但是由于战争的影响和解放区的扩大，现在还有一部分复发的文盲和新文盲，其中大多数是年纪比较大的和妇女，预计今年内可以扫除。
    改用拼音文字对小学教育的影响也非常大。朝鲜小学第一年级用的第一本课本，叫做“我们的语言”。经过3个月这课本的学习，儿童就具有初步的阅读和拼写能力。在这个基础上，儿童接着学习内容比较丰富，描写比较生动活泼的读本。这读本共有82课，课文字数（以翻译出来的汉字计算）最多的有412个字，最少有51个字。
    就小学一年级的儿童所掌握的语汇来说，他们学习字数多的课文是完全可能的，如果是用拼音文字的话。朝鲜小学教育的经验充分地证明了这一点。因为汉字难写，难认，难记，我们就不可能编出像朝鲜一年级所用的内容那样丰富的读本。
    根据我们在开城南山小学的调查，一年级第二学期的儿童能够阅读字数相当多的课文；二年级的儿童能够写简单的信，所写的拼音字，比我国同年级的儿童所写的汉字整齐得多；三年级的儿童能够阅读一般报纸，并且能够写诗；四、五年级的儿童能够看懂比较深的小说，又能写较好的诗。因为拼音文字使小学生很快就能够有阅读和拼写的能力，小学年限可以相应地缩短，从今年起，朝鲜小学的年限便从5年缩短为4年。到1957年四年级和五年级同时毕业，就可以多出约4，000名教师，并腾出更多的教室来招收更多的小学生，这是实行义务教育的有利条件。这一切证明了朝鲜改用拼音文字，对于丰富小学教育的内容，提高小学教育的质量，缩短小学的年限，是有极重大的作用的。
    由于文盲在很短的时间内基本上扫除了，人民的文化水平就有进一步提高的可能，因而供人民大众阅读的出版物大量地增加了。以报纸做例子，现在“劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜”这两种报纸每天各发行大概70，000份。以北朝鲜北部的人口来算，平均每65人有一份“劳动新闻”或者“民主朝鲜”，这比我国报纸的发行数和人口的比例高得多了。
    2、义务教育　解放前朝鲜北部学龄儿童约有200万，上学的只有40％到45％。解放后儿童上学的逐年增加，到1949年上学的有180万。朝鲜民主政府原来准备1950年开始实行义务教育，后来因战事发生，没有执行。停战后1953年上学的儿童有150万；1954年增加到178万；1955年增加到187万。从这些数字看来，上学的儿童数是增加得很快的，战后的发展也是很快的。
    据1955年4月17日的调查，学龄儿童数为2，019，000。朝鲜民主政府已决定于今年实行义务教育。据教育省（相当于我们的教育部）估计，教师和经费都没有困难。值得指出的是朝鲜人民虽然在极端困难的情况下，对儿童教育给予大力支持。据教育省的负责同志告诉我们，朝鲜人民除了出劳动力和材料来建筑校舍外，每年还自动地捐助7亿到8亿朝鲜币做教育经费。民主朝鲜普及教育的发达是突出的：到处有学校、村村有小学；三个村有一所中学。开城的学生数占总人口的25％。这些事实表现出朝鲜的党、政府和人民十分重视教育。学校设备虽然比较差，但是教师在极困难的条件下能够利用一切来进行教学。这种艰苦奋斗的精神是值得我们学习的。
    3、艺术　朝鲜人民十分重视民族艺术传统，大胆地通过实验创造，加以发扬。从平壤的艺术剧场的演出和清津、开城等地方的艺术表演，我们都可以看出朝鲜民族艺术的独特风格和相当高的艺术水平。崔承喜所编的舞剧，如“砂道城的故事”，在发扬朝鲜民族舞蹈的优秀传统的基础上，大胆地和细致地吸收了芭蕾舞许多奔放的步伐，以及中国古典戏剧里的武打、甩袖子、剑舞等动作。在古典歌剧方面，由于朝鲜艺术家大胆创作和实验的精神，也得到了辉煌的成就，如“春香传”，“沈清传”等。朝鲜作家结合着保卫祖国的战争和恢复建设的斗争，创作了大量作品，对战争和生产的胜利，起了很大的鼓舞作用。他们重视儿童文学，为儿童写了不少作品。油画的发达是很突出的，我们到处可以看到油画。在祖国解放战争纪念馆里，我们看到一部分朝鲜人民军画的优美的油画。
    朝鲜音乐家十分重视发扬民间音乐的优良传统。在民间音乐的基础上，他们善于接受和运用西洋音乐的优良传统和经验。歌剧“孔菊和潘菊”的创作就是在民间音乐的基础上，大胆地运用西洋古典歌剧的各种做法的尝试，并且是很成功的。他们一致认为纯粹用西洋传统的和声和乐器的配奏法来处理民间音乐的旋律，是不妥当的。为了发扬民族音乐的特点，“清津浦的船歌”是在和声民族化的基础上创造出来的；“恢复建设之歌”是在民间音乐合唱的加工和管弦乐的结合上创造出来的。
    国立艺术剧场的音乐家运用了西洋发声法，以改进民间歌曲的唱法，如在“李舜臣将军”，“沈清传”等古典歌剧里，导入了合唱和重唱，也有显著的成就。在乐器伴奏上，也做了不少的改进工作，如把两三件乐器的演奏，发展成为30多人的乐队。此外为适应大型乐器的合奏，对民族乐器的音域，共鸣箱的扩大，以及吹奏乐器的音程的准确性，也进行着一系列的科学研究和改造工作。同时，作家同盟对古典音乐的特点，也进行着各方面的科学分析和研究，并且已经发表了不少论著。
    总而言之，朝鲜人民不独在经济恢复建设方面有伟大的成就，并且在文化教育建设方面也有辉煌的成果。我们对这些成就应该进一步加以研究，向朝鲜同志学习，并进一步加强中朝两国的文化交流和合作。
