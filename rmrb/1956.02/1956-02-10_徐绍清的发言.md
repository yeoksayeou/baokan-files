    Xu Shaoqing's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    At this meeting, we heard Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the upsurge of the socialist revolution, Vice Chairman Li Jishen's report on the work of the meeting, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries, and Committee Member Chen Boda's report on "The Socialist Transformation of Chinese Agriculture." I completely agree with and wholeheartedly support them.
    Currently, our country, as Chairman Mao said, is "in the midst of a great upsurge of the socialist revolution," and various construction undertakings are developing vigorously. With the rapid development of these undertakings, the people will inevitably make higher demands on people's opera. Therefore, using rich and colorful opera to meet the cultural life needs of the 600 million people of the motherland is the glorious and arduous task of opera performers. At the same time, our country's international status has been raised to an unprecedented level, and our national opera art has won high honor internationally, playing a significant role in promoting ideological and cultural exchange among the people of various countries and promoting the cause of peace. Therefore, improving the quality of opera art and using excellent opera art with national characteristics as a powerful weapon to promote the cause of peace has also become the glorious and arduous task of opera performers.
    In order to accomplish the aforementioned glorious and arduous task, we opera performers must first strengthen unity.
    In the old society before liberation, under the rule of the reactionary class and the influence of the bad habits of the old society, the unity of the opera circles was not good. There was mutual discrimination and exclusion between different opera genres, between different troupes, and between different performers. Famous actors were jealous of each other and could not humbly learn from each other, exchange experiences, learn from each other's strengths, and improve the quality of art. In the six years since liberation, opera has received attention, and under the leadership and education of the Party and the People's Government, opera performers have attained high political status, their political consciousness has been greatly enhanced, and internal unity has also been increasingly strengthened. The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new" has been implemented in practical work, thus enabling opera art to "rise from the dead" and achieve certain results. However, if we want to enable opera art to meet the increasingly growing demands of the 600 million people for cultural life, and enable our country's opera art to catch up with the world's song and dance art, we opera performers must continue to strengthen internal unity and consolidate our ranks. Currently, there are individual advanced elements in some opera genres who discriminate against the intermediate and backward elements, and do not help them politically or professionally, are conceited, and think that others are hopeless or are afraid of trouble; while the intermediate and backward elements also adopt a passive waiting attitude, and do not try to create conditions and strive for progress, thus stagnating politically and professionally, thinking that "anyway, I am not needed, so I just muddle along." Both of these attitudes are wrong. We should do our best to care for and lead the intermediate and backward elements, help them politically and professionally, improve them, and take care of them in life, so that they gradually become advanced figures. We should also affirm their strengths in some areas, and learn from their strengths to enrich ourselves. The intermediate and backward artists must also work hard to improve themselves and strive for progress. Only in this way can we unleash the potential of everyone and make our opera circles a strong and powerful force.
    Secondly, we should pay attention to cultivating new forces and expanding the ranks of the opera circles. A relatively outstanding and excellent artist must go through a long period of cultivation and training. Undoubtedly, our country will see a high tide of cultural construction along with the high tide of economic construction. There are high requirements for opera performers not only in quantity but also in quality. Therefore, we must pay attention to cultivating new forces as early as possible to expand our ranks, and improve the quality of our ranks from expanding the ranks, to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people.
    Thirdly, we should also enrich the repertoire of opera art. Our country is a country with thousands of years of excellent cultural traditions; there are many repertoires of various opera genres circulating among the people. For example, in the past, many ci melodies were lost in Xiang opera. If we collect them early, we can still collect a lot, which is of great value to enrich our opera content. At the same time, we should also create some new classical repertoires to make our opera content increasingly diverse. I have not done enough in these areas.
    In order to enable opera work to meet the needs of the people and develop, we opera performers should also first strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and professional skills to improve political and professional levels. Second, state-owned troupes and private professional troupes should actively strive for the leadership of local Party committees and governments to strengthen the political and professional work of the troupes, and should also actively strive for the assistance and guidance of social figures who love opera and have certain accomplishments to improve professional levels. Third, we should summarize the artistic experience of old artists to improve and enrich opera art.
    Finally, I wish the conference a complete success, and good health to all committee members and comrades.

    徐绍清的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这次会议听到了周恩来主席的政治报告、郭沫若副主席的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告、李济深副主席的会务工作报告、陈叔通副主席关于资本主义工商业社会主义改造问题的报告、董必武副主席关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告、陈伯达委员的“中国农业的社会主义改造”的报告，我完全同意，并衷心拥护。
    目前，我们的国家正如毛主席所说：“处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中”，各项建设事业正在蓬蓬勃勃的发展。随着这些事业的迅速发展，人民必然也将对人民戏曲提出更高的要求。因此用丰富多采的戏曲来满足祖国六亿人民文化生活的要求，是戏曲艺人的光荣而艰巨的任务。同时，我国的国际地位已空前提高，我国的民族戏曲艺术在国际上赢得了崇高的荣誉，对促进各国人民的思想文化交流、推动和平事业起了很大的作用。因此，提高戏曲艺术质量，以优秀的、富有民族风格的戏曲艺术作为促进和平事业的有力武器，也成为戏曲艺人的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    为了完成上述的光荣而艰巨的任务，我们戏曲艺人首先必须加强团结。
    在解放前旧社会，在反动阶级统治下，在旧社会坏风气熏染下，戏曲界的团结情况是不好的。剧种与剧种、剧团与剧团、艺人与艺人之间互相歧视排挤，名演员之间互相嫉妒，不能互相虚心学习，交流经验，取长补短，提高艺术质量。解放6年来戏曲受到了重视，戏曲艺人在党和人民政府领导教育之下，得到很高的政治地位，政治觉悟也大大提高，内部团结也日益增强。在实际工作中贯彻了“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，因而使戏曲艺术“起死回生”，并且获得了一定的成绩。但是，要使戏曲艺术能够满足六亿人民日益增长的对文化生活的如饥如渴的要求，使我国的戏曲艺术能向世界歌舞艺术看齐，我们戏曲艺人还必须继续加强内部团结；巩固自己的队伍。现在有个别剧种的先进分子歧视中间的和后进的分子，在政治上、业务上不去帮助他们，自高自大，认为别人没出息或者怕麻烦；而中间的和后进的分子也采取消极的等待态度，自己不去努力创造条件，争取进步，因而在政治上业务上停滞不前，认为“反正不用我，我也得过且过”。这两种态度都是错误的。我们应当尽力关心带动中间的和后进的分子，在政治上业务上帮助他们，提高他们，在生活上照顾他们，使他们逐步成为先进人物。也要肯定他们在某些地方的长处，并学习他们的长处，来丰富自己。中间的和后进的艺人，也要努力提高自己，争取进步，这样才能发挥每个人的潜在力量，使我们戏曲界成为一支兵强马壮的队伍。
    其次，我们应该注意培养新生力量，扩大戏曲界的队伍。一个比较出色的优秀的艺人，是要经过长时间的培养和锻炼的。我们的国家，无疑地随着经济建设高潮将会出现一个文化建设的高潮。对戏曲艺人不仅在数量上而且在质量上要求很高，因此我们必须及早地注意培养新生力量，来扩大我们的队伍，从扩大队伍中提高我们的队伍质量，来满足广大人民的需要。
    再次，我们也应该丰富戏曲艺术的剧目。我们的国家是有数千年优良文化传统的国家；流传在人民中间的各个剧种的剧目很多，如湘剧过去就有很多词牌子失传，如果及早搜集，当然仍然可以收集不少，拿来丰富我们的戏曲内容，是极有价值的。同时，我们也应该创造一些新的古典剧目，使我们的戏曲内容日益多种多样化。在这些工作上，我是做得非常不够的。
    为了使戏曲工作能够满足人民需要并使之发展，我们戏曲艺人也应该首先加强马克思列宁主义和业务上的学习，来提高政治和业务水平。第二、国营剧团和民间职业剧团要主动争取地方党和政府的领导，来加强剧团的政治和业务工作，同时也应该主动争取热爱戏曲、并有一定修养的社会人士的协助和指导，来提高业务水平。第三、应该多多总结老艺人的艺术经验，来提高和丰富戏曲艺术。
    最后，祝大会胜利成功，各位委员和同志们身体健康。
