Zhao Xiufeng, the resident instructor of the Zengzhuang Township, First District, Yanshan County, Hebei Province, has been in his post for over a month, but he hasn't been able to delve into the cooperatives. Many cooperatives have problems waiting for him to help solve. Is it because he's sitting around and not working? No, Zhao Xiufeng is very busy. The district's bank branch wants him to be responsible for urging loan repayments, the director of the district's supply and marketing cooperative also pulls him to urge the masses to pay their debts, the responsible comrade of the highway station gave him a deadline to complete the tree planting task on both sides of the highway, and the comrades doing grain work discuss the "three fix" work with him every day. In addition, the township's literacy work, as well as the special district and county's need to understand the health situation and handle people's letters, also require Zhao Xiufeng to do them. At the busiest times, 5 units come to him in a single day. Just dealing with these, he is already overwhelmed, how can he have time to lead the cooperatives? When the Yanshan County Party Committee discovered this situation, it immediately notified the entire county of this typical case, and used various meetings to explain that the main responsibility of the resident township instructors is to study and guide the cooperative movement. Others should not pile everything on him, and he should not take on everything. At present, the resident township instructors in this area have been able to concentrate on leading the cooperatives. However, there are still many resident township instructors like Zhao Xiufeng who cannot "control their own destiny" in other areas. Local Party organizations should also, like the Yanshan County Party Committee, free them from general affairs as soon as possible.

    不要忙坏了指导员
    河北省盐山县一区曾庄乡的驻乡指导员赵秀峰虽然到职已经一个多月，但是还没有深入到社。许多合作社都有问题，等待他去帮助解决。是他坐着不干工作吗？不，赵秀峰很忙，区的银行营业所要他负责催还贷款，区的供销社主任也拉他催群众的欠款，公路站的负责同志给了他限期完成公路两旁的栽树任务，做粮食工作的同志天天同他研究“三定”工作。此外，乡里的扫盲工作，以及专区和县里要了解卫生情况和处理人民来信的情况等等也都要赵秀峰去做。最忙的时候，一天有5个单位来找他。光是应付这些，他已经顾不过来，哪有时间再去领导合作社呢？当盐山县委发现这一情况后，立即把这一典型事例通报全县，并且利用各种会议说明驻乡指导员的主要职责是研究和指导合作化运动。别人不该把一切事情堆到他身上，他也不该包揽一切。目前这个地区的驻乡指导员已能集中精力领导合作社了。但是，像赵秀峰这样不能“掌握自己命运”的驻乡指导员，在其他地区还是不少的。各地党组织也应该像盐山县委一样，把他们尽快从一般事务中解脱出来才对。
