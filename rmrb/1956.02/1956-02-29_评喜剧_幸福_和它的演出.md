Review of the Comedy "Happiness" and its Performance
Playwright: Ai Mingzhi Director: Zheng Tianjian Performed by the China Youth Art Theatre
Liu Zhongping

“Our communist ethics should be concerned with the happiness of hundreds of millions of people, not just with ‘my’ happiness. The old logic is: I want to be a happy person, and I don’t care about the rest. The new logic is: I want to be a happy person, but the most correct way is to make all the others happy; if I do that, then I will also be a happy person. In every one of our actions, there should be a thought running through it for the collective, for the overall victory, and for the overall success.” These words of the famous Soviet educator and writer Makarenko can be used to illustrate the theme of the comedy "Happiness" written by Ai Mingzhi. The basis of the dramatic conflict is the clash between these old and new ideas about happiness. Through the prism of comedy, the author observes the manifestations of this conflict in life, and embodies this theme with vivid characters and realistic life scenes, allowing the conflict between these old and new ideas to flow naturally from the development of the plot. The play is full of optimism, brightness, and joy. Here, the satire of the old consciousness in people's minds is combined with the enthusiasm of believing that this old consciousness can be overcome. This is precisely the characteristic that our new era comedy should have.

Our comedies, no matter how many positive or negative elements the characters are given, the plot always unfolds in a positive environment. This positive environment is our society, the strength of the socialist factors that have gained dominance in our lives and people's consciousness, and the trend that this strength will inevitably overcome the bad habits and shortcomings left over from the old society. The task of our comedy is to use its laughter to destroy those bad habits and shortcomings, and to help the development of socialist forces and socialist trends. It should be said that the comedy "Happiness" is basically successful in solving this main task.

The China Youth Art Theatre brought this play to the stage. The director showed a good talent in creating comedic effects, and the whole performance was fascinating. The success of the performance is mainly due to its creation of several vivid characters. The contradictions and conflicts of these characters, their sympathy and antipathy, their entanglements and loves and hates, and the laughter inspired by them, attracted and infected the audience.

The image of the old worker Hu Hanliang is a kind and lovely one. At the beginning of the play, he comes to the Youth League branch secretary to request the transfer of his assistant Wang Jiayou. From his indignation and his tone, we immediately see this "barrel of gunpowder temper" old worker, who cannot tolerate people who are sloppy in their work and style, just as he cannot tolerate sand in his eyes. He knows who he is working for now, and for whom he is creating happiness, so he cannot tolerate people who hinder and destroy his work. In the portrayal of this character image, the playwright, director and actor have given him certain humorous and comedic elements. For example, his anger at the letter without a stamp, some conflicts with Wang Jiayou, etc., are all very amusing. But this kind of laughter is linked to the audience's favorite straightforward and upright image, and does not have any mocking meaning at all. On the contrary, it deepens the audience's sense of intimacy and respect for the character.

And the laughter that the audience emits at Wang Jiayou is of a completely different nature. This young man, who has had dealings with a "small boss" and is deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology, has become infected with a lot of bad habits. His view of life and happiness completely follows the old logic that Makarenko spoke of. He disregards labor discipline, repeatedly causes accidents, and causes great losses to production—which is a major matter related to the happiness of hundreds of millions of people—but he doesn't care at all. He believes that the old worker's criticism of him is "jealous" of his happiness, and he believes that his friend Liu Chuanhao's help is "destroying" his good deeds... He makes these remarks self-righteously; he goes to Liu Chuanhao's house to interrogate him, but finds that the "squinting eyes" he is pursuing likes not him, but Liu Chuanhao. These scenes are also very capable of inspiring laughter from the audience. This kind of ridicule helps to improve people's understanding and helps to fight for the elimination of bad habits, shortcomings, and the harmful influence of bourgeois ideology.

In contrast to Wang Jiayou is another young worker, the Youth League branch secretary Liu Chuanhao. He thinks more for others than he does for himself. When he knows that the "squinting eyes" Wang Jiayou is pursuing is Hu Shufen, whom he himself is also fond of, he restrains his emotions and openly and sincerely helps Wang Jiayou to correct his shortcomings; he puts his energy and thoughts as much as possible into his work, helping his teacher Hu Hanliang to turn their group into a locomotive in the competition.... As a result, the audience saw that he got his happiness according to a different logic.

But this play also has some things that make us feel dissatisfied. The script's exposure of the harmful influence of bourgeois ideology is not deep enough or powerful enough, and the resolution of the conflict seems relatively simple and easy. And I think this is related to the fact that the conflict revealed by the script is not sharp enough, and the degree of typification of the characters is not sufficient.

In the play, except for the scene where Wang Jiayou runs to Liu Chuanhao's house to interrogate him, there are not many direct and sharp conflicts between positive and negative characters. And the climax of this conflict is caused by an unrealistic plot—Wang Jiayou's letter to Hu Shufen without a stamp. Hu Shufen actually appreciates this letter, which her father scolded as "really shameless... mushy," and misunderstands that it was written to her by Liu Chuanhao, which is neither in line with Hu Shufen's character nor in line with Liu Chuanhao's character.

The image of the positive character Liu Chuanhao in the play is what the author has worked hard to portray. But even in this character image, we still see the shortcomings of insufficient typification. What he has are only the general characteristics of advanced young workers, but his personality is not distinct enough. He and Wang Jiayou are old friends and rivals in love. Their views on life are completely different, and he is in a position where he must help Wang Jiayou correct his mistakes. In this case, what kind of attitude and what kind of words should he use to move Wang Jiayou and help Wang Jiayou correct his mistakes? The author should and could have found opportunities to let him more deeply and extensively show his world of thoughts and feelings in conflicts and debates with Wang Jiayou, and compare it with Wang Jiayou's small and selfish spiritual world. But in many places, the author avoids this kind of conflict, and would rather use impersonal words like "Why don't you work hard, you're letting yourself down, and letting everyone down," to replace the debate that could only exist between them, to replace the real conflict between two personalities and two views of life.

The shortcomings of the characters lacking individuality are especially obvious in the workshop director and the Party branch secretary. The author saw the supporting and abetting role of bureaucracy on the influence of bourgeois ideology, but he did not let the workshop director express any positive or negative opinions in the struggle, but only wrote him as a person who is afraid of taking responsibility and afraid of being accused of being a bureaucrat. In real life, this kind of "pure" bureaucrat does not exist. Merely extracting the essence of a certain type of character, and abandoning those things that belong to the individual on a living person, can only create a shadow of a certain concept.

The Party branch secretary is completely uninvolved in the conflict. His criticism of the workshop director is conducted on the phone, his criticism of the "small troublemaker" Deng Zhongliang is conducted behind the scenes, and his direct meeting with Wang Jiayou is only after the conflict is resolved, and is nothing more than a few concluding remarks. Characters who lack action cannot be vivid or powerful.

From the director's point of view, it seems that the comedic techniques are also used too evenly, and the sharp ridicule of the negative characters is not prominently expressed from those gentle humor that is only linked to the positive characters, so it also failed to strengthen the attack on the influence of bourgeois ideology. And what should be the keynote of the comedy is precisely the sharp ridicule of negative phenomena, not gentle humor.

We point out these shortcomings in the hope that this play can be better, or in other words, can take another step forward on the basis of this play. Since the playwright, director, and actors have all shown their talents, then we can ask them and hope that they will create better works that can deeply imprint the character images, along with the social ideas they represent, in the memory of the audience.

    评喜剧“幸福”和它的演出
    编剧：艾明之　　导演：郑天健　　中国青年艺术剧院演出
    刘仲平
    “我们共产主义的伦理道德应该是替千百万人的幸福着想，而不是仅仅为‘我的’幸福着想。旧的逻辑是：我想成为一个幸福的人，其余的人我是不管的。新的逻辑是：我想成为一个幸福的人，但是最正确的办法，是使所有其余的人都成为幸福的人；如果我将这样作的话，那时，我将也成为幸福的人了。在我们的每一个行为中，都应该贯穿着一种为了集体，为了总的胜利和总的成功的思想。”苏联的著名教育家、作家马卡伦柯的这段话，恰好可以借用来说明艾明之所写的喜剧“幸福”的主题。戏剧冲突的基础就是这种关于幸福的新旧思想的冲突。作者透过喜剧的三棱镜观察了这种冲突在生活里的表现，并且用生动的人物形象和真实的生活图景体现了这个主题，从戏剧情节的发展中使这种新旧思想的冲突自然而然流露了出来。戏里面洋溢着乐观、明朗、愉快的气氛。在这里，对于人们思想里的旧意识的讽刺，是同深信这种旧意识可以克服的热情结合在一起的。这点正是我们新时代的喜剧应有的特点。
    我们的喜剧，不管剧中人物被赋予多少正面的或反面的因素，剧情总是要在正面环境里展开的。这个正面环境就是我们的社会，就是在我们生活中和人们意识里已经取得统治地位的社会主义因素的力量，就是这种力量必然能够战胜旧社会遗留下来的恶习和缺点的趋势。我们的喜剧的任务，就是要用它的笑去摧毁那些恶习和缺点，帮助社会主义力量、社会主义趋势的发展。应该说，喜剧“幸福”在解决这个主要任务方面，基本上是成功的。
    中国青年艺术剧院把这个戏搬上了舞台。导演在创造喜剧效果上显示了很好的才能，整个演出是引人入胜的。演出的成功，主要是由于它创造了几个生动的人物形象。这些人物的矛盾和冲突、他们的同情和反感，他们的纠葛和爱憎，以及由此激发出来的笑，吸引了、感染了观众。
    老工人胡汉亮的形象，是一个令人感到亲切的可爱的形象。戏一开场，他来找团支部书记要求调走他的助手王家有，从他的愤慨、他的语气里，我们一下子就看到了这个“一筒子火药脾气”的老工人，容不得工作上、作风上吊儿郎当的人，正像眼睛里容不得沙子一样。他知道现在是为谁干活，为谁创造幸福，所以他不能容忍妨碍和破坏他的工作的人。在这个人物形象的刻画中，剧作者、导演和演员都给了他某些幽默和喜剧性的因素。例如他对那封没贴邮票的信大发脾气，同王家有的某些冲突等等场面，就都很能使人发笑。但是这种笑是同观众所喜爱的爽朗、正直的形象联系在一起的，完全没有任何嘲笑的意味，相反的，它使观众加深了对于人物的亲切感和尊敬。
    而观众对于王家有所发出的笑，却具有完全不同的性质。这个和一个“小老板”打上交道、深深陷在资产阶级思想影响里面的小伙子，沾染了一身坏习气。他对于生活，对于幸福的看法，完全遵循着马卡伦柯所说的那种旧的逻辑。他玩忽劳动纪律，一再闹事故，使生产——这正是关系到千百万人的幸福的重大事情——受到极大损失，却全不在意。他认为老工人对他的批评是，“妒忌”他的幸福，他认为他的朋友刘传豪对他的帮助，是“破坏”他的好事……。他自作聪明地发表这些见解；他理直气壮地跑到刘传豪家里去兴师问罪，结果却发现了他追求的“眯眼睛”所喜欢的不是他，而是刘传豪。这些场面也都很能激发观众的笑。这种嘲笑是有助于提高人们的认识，有助于为消除恶习、缺点、资产阶级思想的有害影响而斗争的。
    和王家有成为对照的是另一个青年工人，团支部书记刘传豪。他为别人着想的时候要比为自己着想的时候多。当他知道王家有所追求的“眯眼睛”正是他自己也倾心的胡淑芬的时候，他克制了自己的情感，光明磊落地诚恳地帮助了王家有去改正缺点；他把力气和心思尽量用到工作上，帮助胡汉亮老师傅把他们那个组变成了竞赛中的火车头……。结果，观众是都看到了的：他是按照另一种逻辑得到了他的幸福的。
    但是这个戏也有使我们感到不满足的地方。剧本对于资产阶级思想的有害影响的揭露还不够深刻、不够有力，矛盾的解决也显得比较简单、轻易。而这点我以为是同剧本所揭示的冲突不够尖锐，人物性格的典型化程度不够充分有关。
    剧中除了王家有跑到刘传豪家里去兴师问罪那场戏以外，正面人物同反面人物的直接的尖锐的冲突是不多的。而这个冲突的高潮又是由一个不够真实的情节——王家有写给胡淑芬的那封没贴邮票的信——造成的。胡淑芬居然欣赏他父亲骂为“真不害臊……肉麻”的这封信，并且误会到是刘传豪写给她的，这既不符合胡淑芬的性格，也不符合刘传豪的性格。
    剧中的正面人物刘传豪的形象，是作者所着力刻画的。但是即使在这个人物形象上，我们也还看到了典型化不够的缺陷。他所具有的还仅仅是先进青年工人的一般的特点，而个性却不够鲜明。他和王家有的关系，是老朋友，又是爱情上的竞争对手。他们对待生活的看法截然不同，而他又处在必须帮助王家有改正错误的地位上。在这种情况下，他应该用一种什么态度，什么样的话去打动王家有，帮助王家有改正错误呢？作者应该而且可以找出机会让他在同王家有的冲突和争辩中，更深刻更广泛地展示他的思想和感情的世界，并把它拿来同王家有的渺小自私的精神世界相对照。但是作者在许多地方却回避了这种冲突，宁愿用“为什么不好好干活，可对不起自己，对不起大家啊”这一类缺乏个性的话，来代替只有他们之间才可能有的争辩，来代替两种性格，两种人生观之间的真正的冲突。
    人物缺乏个性的缺点，在车间主任和党支部书记身上，看得尤其明显。作者看到了官僚主义对资产阶级思想影响的支持和助长作用，但是他没有让车间主任在斗争中表示任何正面的或反面的意见，而仅仅把他写成一个怕负责任，怕被人指斥为官僚主义者的人。在现实生活里，这种“纯粹的”官僚主义者却是没有的。仅仅抽出某一类人物的本质，而舍弃了活人身上的那些属于个性的东西，其结果就只能创造出某种概念的影子。
    党支部书记完全没有卷进冲突里去。他对车间主任的批评是在电话里进行的，他对“小起哄”邓忠良的批评是在幕后进行的，而他和王家有的直接见面，却在矛盾解决以后，不过是说了几句收场话。缺乏行动的人物不可能是鲜明的、有力的。
    从导演方面来说，仿佛把喜剧手法也运用得太平均化了，没有把对于反面人物的尖锐的嘲笑，从那些只同正面人物相联系的温和的幽默当中突出地表现出来，因而也未能加强对于资产阶级思想影响的抨击力量。而应该成为喜剧的基调的，却正是对于反面现象的尖锐的嘲笑，而不是温和的幽默。
    我们指出这些缺点，是希望这个戏能够更好一些，或者说，能够在这个戏的基础上再前进一步。既然剧作者、导演和演员们都显示了他们的才能，那末我们就有可能要求他们、希望他们创作出更好的能够把人物形象连同他们所代表的社会思想深深烙印在观众记忆里的作品。
