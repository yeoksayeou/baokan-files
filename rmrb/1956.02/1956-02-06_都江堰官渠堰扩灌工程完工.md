    Completion of the Dujiangyan Guanqu Irrigation Expansion Project

    The fourth phase of the Dujiangyan Guanqu Irrigation Expansion Project in western Sichuan was fully completed at the end of January. This phase of the project will expand the irrigated area of farmland by 430,000 mu in Guanghan, Mianzhu, and Deyang counties. Together with the previous three phases, it can irrigate a total of 1.3 million mu of farmland. In addition to extending the main canal by 31.5 kilometers, the fourth phase of the project also widened and deepened the original main canal, allowing many single-season fields to be converted into double-season or triple-season fields, greatly increasing the yield per unit area.

    都江堰官渠堰扩灌工程完工
    川西都江堰官渠堰第四期扩灌工程，1月底已经全部完成。这期工程可使广汉、绵竹、德阳3县灌溉面积扩大农田43万亩；连同前三期工程，共可灌溉农田130万亩。四期工程除延长干渠31.5公里外，还将原干渠挖宽、掏深，使许多一季田可以改为两季或三季田，大大提高单位面积产量。
