    "Use Your Brain, Find Fertilizer Sources"
    This year, Jinyue Township in the suburbs of Hengyang City, Hunan Province, plans to expand the planting area of double-cropping rice from 280 mu last year to 5,000 mu, and therefore needs to increase a large amount of fertilizer. At first, people looked to the city, wanting to buy ready-made commercial fertilizers. They said: Anyway, the countryside cannot find so much fertilizer. As a result, many people were not actively accumulating fertilizer. Seeing this situation, the Jinyue Township Party Branch immediately led the masses to launch a "Use Your Brain, Find Fertilizer Sources" campaign. After everyone's research, they found 25 kinds of fertilizer sources, including sod, toilet mud, floating mud, old brick soil, leaves, ditch silt, garbage, and chicken and duck manure. Snail shell ash, which was rarely used in the past, was also found to be a very effective fertilizer. In just a few days, agricultural cooperatives such as Jinlong and Jiulong accumulated 3,600 jin of snail shell ash. As of February 5th, the whole township had accumulated more than 29,000 dan of various soil fertilizers. It is estimated that if the 25 kinds of fertilizer sources are fully utilized, 80% of all the required fertilizer can be accumulated.
    The experience of Jinyue Township proves that there are many fertilizer sources in the countryside. As long as we earnestly look for these fertilizer sources, we can meet the needs of increasing production.

    “动脑筋，找肥源”
    湖南省衡阳市郊区金叶乡今年准备把双季稻的种植面积由去年的280亩扩大到5，000亩，因此需要增加大量肥料。开始，人们都把眼睛望着城里，想买现成的商品肥料。他们说：反正农村找不出那么多肥料。结果是不少人都不积极积肥了。金叶乡党支部看到这个情况，立即领导群众开展“动脑筋，找肥源”运动。经过大家研究，找出了草皮、厕所泥、浮泥、陈砖土、树叶、沟淤、垃圾、鸡鸭粪等肥源共25种。过去很少用过的螺蛳壳灰，也被发现是一种肥效很好的肥料。金龙、九龙等农业合作社没几天工夫，就积了3，600斤螺蛳壳灰。到2月5日为止，全乡仅各种土肥就积了29，000多担。据估计，如果把25种肥源充分利用起来，可以积够全部所需肥料的80％。
    金叶乡的经验证明，农村的肥源是很多的。只要认真去寻找这些肥源，是可以供得上增产的需要的。
