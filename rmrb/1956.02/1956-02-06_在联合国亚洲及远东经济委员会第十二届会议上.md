Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 3rd: The Twelfth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East opened at 10:30 AM on February 2nd at the Putanna Chetti Town Hall in Bangalore.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered the opening address to the conference. He requested that the People's Republic of China be admitted to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. He expressed regret for the bizarre practice of addressing Asian issues without the participation of a large part of the continent, namely China.

Nehru expressed his pleasure that Cambodia, Ceylon, Laos, and Nepal had been approved for admission to the United Nations. He hoped that the approval of Japan and the Mongolian People's Republic for admission to the United Nations would not be delayed for too long.

Nehru pointed out that the old habit of deciding Asian issues elsewhere without consulting Asia and the Asian people is now outdated, but the old ways continue to be practiced, and some people are trying to decide Asian issues in distant places without regard for the sentiments of Asians or considering the realities of the political situation. Leaving aside any other attitude toward this issue, this is not a very useful way of handling things. In fact, hundreds of millions of people exist, they have aspirations, and they are unwilling to be ignored. Nehru said: "Whether you consider it from an economic point of view or from the point of view of individual progress, the fate of Asia cannot be decided by others without Asia's consent, goodwill, unity, and cooperation - this basic understanding of the problem must exist." He said that the Asian people have a new awakening, and they hope for progress and advancement.

Nehru said that the people of countries that are in the same position as backward countries in Asia should gather together to discuss matters, because their problems, although not exactly the same, are similar. He hoped that the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East could pay attention to certain proposals regarding economic and cultural issues raised at the Bandung Conference and take steps to implement these proposals.

Nehru advocated setting aside political conflicts to consider social and economic issues. He believed that this approach itself would create a beneficial atmosphere for considering political issues. He said that if financial or technical assistance to backward countries is combined with certain political issues or political considerations, then such assistance loses its value and effect, and such assistance is fundamentally damaged by the motives hidden behind it. He also said that assistance may be necessary, but no country can grow unless it relies on its own efforts, labor, and experience.

Nehru also spoke about "Panchsheel" in his speech. He explained that this is India's attitude towards international issues - mutual non-interference, mutual non-aggression, and peaceful coexistence. He said: "If we want to abolish war, then there is no other way but the way of peace."

The agenda of the meeting included important items such as discussion of the economic situation in Asia, the population problems facing Asian countries, economic development and planning issues, trade, agriculture, transportation, and technical assistance activities in the region. Reports drafted by various committees will also be discussed at the meeting.

More than 200 representatives from 24 countries attended the meeting. The delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions attending the meeting included head Jean Desso, Ma Chungu (People's Republic of China), and Mukherjee (India).

The meeting is scheduled to close on February 14.

    Soviet Union proposes restoring China's seat

Xinhua News Agency, Bangalore, February 3rd: The Twelfth Session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East continued its meeting on the afternoon of February 2nd. The meeting elected Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, Kamarkar, as chairman.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Maletin, put forward a proposal requesting the meeting to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. He said that the absence of a representative of the People's Republic of China from the Commission is an extremely unfair practice towards the great Chinese people, a violation of international law, and will hinder the solution of economic and political problems throughout the world, especially in Asia and the Far East. Maletin emphasized: It is time to change this situation.

After Maletin spoke, the Thai representative immediately suggested that this session not discuss the issue. Indian representative Bhagat strongly opposed Thailand's suggestion. Bhagat said that although this issue has been before the Commission for many years, it has not been faced with a realistic attitude.

After this, the meeting decided by a vote of 15 to 5 (Soviet Union, India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan) not to consider the issue at this session.

The delegations of India, the Soviet Union, and Indonesia protested against the meeting's decision.

Then, the committee discussed and adopted the agenda. The head of the Soviet delegation, Maletin, moved to include a new item on the agenda to allow the Mongolian People's Republic to join the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. He said that the Mongolian People's Republic is a sovereign country with vast territory and abundant resources, and it should become a member of the Commission. Representatives from India and Burma supported this suggestion. The US representative opposed including this item on the agenda.

At the meeting on the morning of February 3rd, the Committee passed Australia's suggestion by 19 votes to send the Mongolian People's Republic's application to join the Committee to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, instead of having the Committee meeting discuss it further.

    Soviet representative requests general distribution of China's memorandum

The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East continued its meeting on the afternoon of February 3rd. Soviet representative Veliky pointed out at the meeting that the document submitted by the Chinese government, "Achievements of the People's Republic of China in Economic Construction in the Past Six Years," was not widely distributed, while documents from the Chiang Kai-shek clique slandering the great People's Republic of China were distributed to all delegations. He requested the Executive Secretary to immediately distribute the memorandum of the People's Republic of China to all members.

The Indonesian representative said in his speech that if this document is distributed to all delegations, it would be of interest to everyone.

    Memorandum submitted by the World Federation of Trade Unions

Xinhua News Agency, Bangalore, February 4th: The Twelfth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East continued on February 4th. The meeting discussed the economic situation of Asian countries.

The Indian representative pointed out in his speech that many countries in the Asia and Far East region are laying the foundation for developing industry. He talked about India's economic development and the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan.

In his speech, the US representative discredited the materials on the economic development of the People's Republic of China in the "1955 Survey of Asia and the Far East" published by the Secretariat of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and slandered China.

The World Federation of Trade Unions submitted a memorandum on the economic situation in Asia to the conference and spoke at the meeting. The memorandum summarized the development of Asia in the past year, especially the Asian-African Conference, the strengthening of relations between Asian countries, and the improvement of cooperation between countries with different social systems.

The memorandum said: "Obstacles hindering the establishment of freer and wider trade relations, especially the trade embargo against China, remain a heavy burden on the economies of Asian countries and an obstacle to raising employment levels."

The memorandum further pointed out: "The manipulation of Asian industry, banking, trade, and shipping by foreign capital is bound to hinder and slow down industrialization and development."

In summarizing the propositions of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the economic development issues in Asia, the memorandum said that its propositions are based on the following two principles: "Economic development must be fundamentally aimed at achieving national independence, and economic development policies must be directly aimed at improving the living standards of the people."

The memorandum said that in implementing these principles, "The World Federation of Trade Unions hopes that all outstanding issues in Asia will be quickly resolved taking into account the right of self-determination of the Asian people and in accordance with the interests of peaceful cooperation between all countries. It also hopes that the issue of admitting Asian countries to the United Nations, especially granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate status, will be resolved in accordance with the wishes of the people of the region."

    在联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会第十二届会议上
    尼赫鲁发表演说
    据新华社新德里3日电　联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会第十二届会议2月2日上午10时30分在班加罗尔的普坦纳契蒂市政厅开幕。
    印度总理尼赫鲁向会议发表开幕演说。他要求接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会。他对于没有大陆上的一个很大的部分、即中国的参加而处理亚洲问题这种怪诞的做法表示遗憾。
    尼赫鲁对柬埔寨、锡兰、老挝和尼泊尔被批准加入联合国一事表示高兴。他希望日本和蒙古人民共和国的被批准加入联合国不致于拖得太久。
    尼赫鲁指出，亚洲问题常常在不跟亚洲和亚洲人民商量的情况下在别的地方决定，这种老习惯现在已经过时了，但是老一套的办法仍旧在继续施行，而且有人在企图在不顾及亚洲人的情绪或者是不从实际政治的观点来考虑的情况下在遥远的地方决定亚洲问题。且不说对这个问题的任何其他态度，这不是处理问题的很有用的方法。事实上，亿万人民存在着，他们具有热望，而且他们不愿意为人漠视。尼赫鲁说：“不论你从经济方面还是从个别进展方面来考虑，亚洲的命运不能在没有亚洲的同意、善意、联合和合作下由别人来决定——必须具有这种对问题的基本了解。”他说，亚洲人民有了新的觉醒，他们希望进步和前进。
    尼赫鲁说，处于同样是亚洲的落后国家的地位的国家的人民应该聚集在一起商议，因为它们的问题虽然不是完全一样的，也是相类似的。他希望亚洲及远东经济委员会能够注意万隆会议上所提出的关于经济及文化问题的某些建议，并且采取步骤来实行这些建议。
    尼赫鲁主张抛开政治冲突来考虑社会和经济问题。他认为，这种作法本身就会为考虑政治问题创造某种有益的气氛。他说，假如把对于落后国家的财政或技术援助同某些政治问题或政治考虑结合起来，那末这种援助就丧失了它的价值和作用，而且，这种援助也就要在基本上被它后面所隐藏的动机所损害了，他又说，援助可能是必要的，可是，除非是靠着自己的努力、劳动和经验，否则任何国家都不会成长。
    尼赫鲁在他的演说中还谈到“潘查希拉”，他解释说，这是印度对国际问题的态度——互不干涉、互不侵犯和和平共处的态度。他说：“如果我们要废除战争，那么没有其他办法只有和平的办法。”
    会议的议程包括了一些重要项目如讨论亚洲经济情况，亚洲国家所面临的人口问题，经济发展和计划问题，这个地区的贸易、农业、交通和技术援助活动。各个委员会所草拟的报告也将在会上进行讨论。
    出席会议的有来自24个国家的200多位代表。出席会议的世界工会联合会代表团包括团长让·德索、马纯古（中华人民共和国）和慕克吉（印度）。
    会议定于2月14日闭幕。
    苏联建议恢复我国席位
    据新华社班加罗尔3日电　亚洲及远东经济委员会第十二届会议在2月2日下午继续开会。会议选出印度工商部负责商业部长卡马卡尔为主席。
    苏联代表团团长马列金提出一个提案，要求会议恢复中华人民共和国在亚洲及远东经济委员会中的合法地位。他说，委员会没有中华人民共和国的代表出席，是对伟大的中国人民的极不公正的做法，是违反国际法的行为，而且会阻碍全世界、特别是亚洲和远东的经济和政治问题的解决。马列金强调指出：现在是改变这种情况的时候了。
    马列金发言后，泰国代表立刻建议这届会议不讨论这个问题。印度代表巴加特强烈反对泰国的建议。巴加特说，虽然这个问题已经摆在委员会面前许多年了，但是对于这个问题一直没有用现实的态度加以正视。
    在这以后，会议以15票对5票（苏联、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和阿富汗）决定在这届会议上暂不考虑这个问题。
    印度、苏联和印度尼西亚代表团先后对会议的这一决定提出抗议。
    然后，委员会讨论通过议程问题。苏联代表团团长马列金提出动议，主张把允许蒙古人民共和国加入亚洲及远东经济委员会的新项目列入议程。他说，蒙古人民共和国是拥有广大领土和丰富资源的主权国家，它应当成为委员会的成员国。印度和缅甸代表支持这个建议。美国代表反对把这个项目列入议程。
    委员会在2月3日上午的会议上以19票通过了澳大利亚的建议：把蒙古人民共和国参加委员会的申请书送交联合国经济及社会理事会，而不由委员会会议作进一步的讨论。苏联代表要求普遍散发我国的备忘录
    亚洲及远东经济委员会2月3日下午继续开会。苏联代表维利基在会上指出，中国政府所提出的“中华人民共和国过去六年来在经济建设上的成就”的文件没有普遍地散发，而关于蒋介石集团诬蔑伟大的中华人民共和国的文件却散发给所有的代表团。他要求执行秘书立即把中华人民共和国的备忘录散发给所有的委员。
    印度尼西亚的代表在发言时说，如果把这个文件散发给所有的代表团，这将是大家都感到兴趣的。
    世界工联代表提出的备忘录
    据新华社班加罗尔4日电　联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会第十二届会议在2月4日继续举行。会议讨论了亚洲国家的经济情况。
    印度代表在会上发言指出，亚洲及远东地区许多国家正在奠定发展工业的基础。他谈到印度经济发展情况和第二个五年计划的任务。
    美国代表在发言中诋毁亚洲及远东经济委员会秘书处所公布的“1955年亚洲和远东调查”这一文件中关于中华人民共和国经济发展的材料，并且对中国进行诽谤。
    世界工会联合会代表向会议提出了关于亚洲经济情况的备忘录，并且在会上发了言。备忘录中综述了过去一年亚洲的发展，特别是亚非会议、亚洲国家间关系的加强、社会制度不同的国家间的合作的改善。
    备忘录说：“妨碍建立更自由的和更广泛的贸易关系的障碍，特别是对中国的贸易禁运，仍然是对亚洲各国经济的沉重负担和妨碍提高就业水平的障碍。”
    备忘录进一步指出：“外国资本对亚洲工业、银行、贸易、航运的操纵势必阻挠和减慢工业化和发展。”
    备忘录在总结世界工会联合会的主张和亚洲的经济发展问题的时候说，它的主张是以下列两项原则为基础的：“经济发展基本上必须以达到民族独立为目标，经济发展的政策必须直接导向人民生活水平的提高”。
    备忘录说，在执行这些原则的时候，“世界工会联合会希望亚洲一切悬而未决的问题将在考虑到亚洲人民的自决权利以及符合所有各国间的和平合作利益的情况下迅速获得解决。它还希望，关于接纳各亚洲国家进入联合国的问题，特别是给予中华人民共和国以合法地位的问题，将按照这个地区各国人民的愿望获得解决。”
