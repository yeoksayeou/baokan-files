Benxi, February 11th (By our reporter) – Li Qingzhen, a miner at the Nanfen Open-Pit Iron Mine of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company, has continuously improved mining methods, increasing mining efficiency by 5 times and reducing the cost per ton of ore by 76.04%.

As early as August of last year, Li Qingzhen proposed to the mine leadership an improved method of organizing mining labor, changing the previous three-shift drilling and blasting method to a method where one team using one drill is responsible for one working face. This can fully utilize the work efficiency of each shift, increasing the mining efficiency of each shift from 30 tons to 90 tons. Recently, he proposed further improvements to the mining method. He suggested extending the drilling distance and deepening the drilling depth in order to increase the amount of ore blasted. In January, Li Qingzhen used this mining method to average 179 tons of ore per day, an increase of nearly double his own new quota of 90 tons. He also created a record of mining 300 tons per day. The Nanfen Open-Pit Iron Mine is now vigorously preparing to promote this advanced mining method throughout the mine.

    本溪矿工李庆振改进采矿方法
    提高采矿效率5倍，降低成本76％以上
    本报本溪11日电　本溪钢铁公司南芬露天铁矿采矿工人李庆振连续改进采矿方法，使采矿效率提高5倍，每吨矿石的成本降低76.04％。
    李庆振在去年8月间，曾向矿的领导方面提出过改进采矿劳动组织的建议，把过去三班打眼放炮的方法，改为一个班一台凿机包一个掌子的作业方法，这样就可以充分发挥每班的工作效能，使每班采矿效率由30吨提高到90吨。最近他又提出了进一步改进采矿方法的建议。他建议延长打眼距离，加深打眼的深度，以便增加矿石的爆破量。1月份李庆振用这种采矿方法，平均每日采矿179吨，比他自己创造的新定额90吨又提高了将近一倍，他还曾创造每日采矿300吨的最高纪录。现在南芬露天铁矿正在大力准备在全矿推广这种先进的采矿方法。
