    Liu Yongming Must Be Sent Back
    Qin Benli
    Our Chinese student Liu Yongming, who was returning from the United States, was forcibly detained in Hong Kong by the U.S. government. He is currently being held in a refugee camp under the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Social Bureau. Liu Yongming's wife, Gui Qionghua, and his 8-year-old daughter, after learning about Liu Yongming's return to China, specifically traveled from their hometown of Nanjing to Shenzhen to await his return. However, Liu Yongming cannot immediately reunite with his family, from whom he has been separated for many years. This is yet another example of the U.S. government deliberately making things difficult for Chinese students in the United States who wish to freely return to their motherland.
    Liu Yongming had long expressed his desire to return to his country. In 1950, the U.S. government, using the excuse that he was mentally unsound and "unfit to travel," detained him in a mental hospital in the United States. It was not until recently, when our representatives specifically requested his return from the U.S. representatives during the Sino-U.S. talks in Geneva, and with the assistance of the Indian side based on the Sino-U.S. agreement, and after the Chinese Red Cross sent a telegram requesting assistance from the American Red Cross, that the U.S. government was forced to release Liu Yongming. However, Liu Yongming was unreasonably detained by the U.S. government in Hong Kong during his journey home.
    Liu Yongming's detention in Hong Kong was premeditated by the U.S. government. On the ship back to China, Liu Yongming was isolated and not allowed to be with other returning Chinese students from the United States, and his freedom of movement was restricted. American personnel with ulterior motives used the excuse of "taking care" of him and subjected him to mental threats. When the ship arrived in Hong Kong, after the rest of the returning students from the United States were sent by the Hong Kong authorities to a motorboat to Kowloon, Liu Yongming was forced to attend a press conference convened by the British Information Services on the ship. One must ask, if Liu Yongming needed the "care" of American personnel on the ship because he was mentally unsound, why was he allowed to attend a press conference? This press conference was announced to Hong Kong reporters by the British Information Services two days before the ship arrived.
    Liu Yongming was originally a mentally sound person. It was only because he expressed his desire to return to his country that the U.S. authorities persecuted, intimidated, and deceived him, which damaged his mental state and caused some abnormal phenomena in his nerves. His mental state was further persecuted during his journey back home, exacerbating his illness. However, the British Information Services forced a person who had been subjected to long-term mental abuse and whose mind was not very clear to attend a press conference. They even used a statement made at the press conference by a person in an unstable state that he wanted to stay in Hong Kong as a basis for detaining Liu Yongming. This not only proves that the U.S. government's detention of Liu Yongming in Hong Kong was prearranged; it also proves that the U.S. government persecuted a person who was originally mentally sound into a mentally unsound person, and then used this result to create a basis for detaining him, preventing him from reuniting with his family as soon as possible. Such inhumane practices cannot but arouse indignation and will be disdained by people around the world. The Hong Kong British authorities' act of helping the U.S. government to detain Liu Yongming without any reason will not be understood by the Chinese people.
    The U.S. government's shameful collusion in persecuting Chinese students in the United States must be condemned! The British authorities in Hong Kong have a responsibility to send back Liu Yongming.

    必须送回刘永铭
    钦本立
    我国留美学生刘永铭在归国途中被美国政府设法强行扣留在香港，现在被拘留在香港社会局管辖的一个难民营里。刘永铭的妻子桂琼华和他的8岁女儿在知道刘永铭回国的消息之后，特地从家乡南京赶到深圳等待着他的归来，但刘永铭竟不能立即和他别离多年的亲人团聚。这是美国政府蓄意留难中国留美学生自由返回祖国的又一个例证。
    刘永铭早就表示了要回到祖国的志愿。在1950年，美国政府借口说他神经不健全，“不适于旅行”，被拘留在美国一个神经病院。直到最近我国代表在日内瓦中美会谈中指名向美方代表要人，并由印度方面根据中美会谈的协议进行协助，以及中国红十字会打电报要求美国红十字会协助之后，美国政府这才被迫释放了刘永铭。然而，刘永铭在回国途中却又遭到了美国政府所策划的毫无道理的扣留。
    刘永铭这次被扣留在香港是美国政府事前就设法布置的。刘永铭在回国途中的船上，就被单独隔离，不准和其他归国留美学生在一起，行动失去自由。别有来历的美国人员借口“照顾”，对他又施加精神上的威胁。船到香港，当其余的归国留美学生被香港当局送上到九龙的汽艇之后，就强迫刘永铭在船上举行了由英国新闻处召集的记者招待会。人们不得不问，如果刘永铭因神经不健全在船上需要美国人员的“照顾”，为什么还让他出席记者招待会呢？而这个记者招待会在船到两天前就由英国新闻处通知香港各报记者参加的。
    刘永铭本是一个神经健全的人。仅仅由于他表示了回国的志愿，在美国当局对他进行迫害、恫吓、欺骗的情况下，使他的精神遭到了打击，使他的神经出现了某些不正常的现象。在回国途中精神又遭到迫害，加重了他的病态。但英国新闻处却强使这样一个长期遭到精神虐待而神志不甚清楚的人出席记者招待会，甚至利用神态不安定的人在记者招待会上说要留在香港的一句话，香港移民局官员就作为根据，把刘永铭加以扣留。这不但证明美国政府在香港扣留刘永铭是事前早作了布置的；并且，也证明了美国政府把一个神经原先健全的人迫害成神经不健全的人，而又利用这种结果制造根据，加以扣留，使得他不能和自己的亲人早日团聚。这种毫无人道的做法不能不令人感到愤慨，也不能不为世界人士所不齿。而香港英国当局竟然帮同美国政府无故扣留刘永铭的做法，也决不会得到中国人民的谅解。
    美国政府迫害留美中国学生这种可耻勾当必须受到谴责！香港的英国当局有责任送回刘永铭。
