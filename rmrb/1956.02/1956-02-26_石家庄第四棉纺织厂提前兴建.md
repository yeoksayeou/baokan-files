Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, February 25th: Construction of the modern state-owned Shijiazhuang Fourth Cotton Textile Factory began ahead of schedule on the 18th.

　　This cotton textile factory has more than 82,000 spindles and more than 3,600 looms. It was originally a construction project during the Second Five-Year Plan period, but now, due to the rapid development of the national agricultural cooperation movement, this year's cotton production is expected to increase significantly compared to last year, so it was decided to start construction ahead of schedule. Now, the factory construction workers have formulated specific plans to complete the construction of this cotton textile factory ahead of schedule.
