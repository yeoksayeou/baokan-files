Comrades! The enormous political and labor enthusiasm with which the Soviet people have greeted the 20th Congress of our Party proves the unlimited trust and complete support of the Soviet people for the policies of the Communist Party, because the Party has tirelessly led the struggle to defend the interests of the people, to achieve the victory of communism in our country, and to strive for world peace. (Applause)

The entire membership of the armed forces, like all the Soviet people, is closely united around their beloved Communist Party as the 20th Congress convenes. Soviet soldiers are boundlessly loyal to their people, to the Communist Party, and to the Soviet government. They are always ready to gloriously and outstandingly fulfill their military duty to defend our beloved motherland. (Applause)

Comrades! The Party and the government have done everything possible to safeguard peace and strengthen trust and friendship among all peoples. In order to ease international tensions and build trust between countries, the Soviet government has proposed disarmament, a ban on the use of weapons of mass destruction, and has taken concrete measures to reduce its own armed forces. In August last year, the Soviet government adopted a decision to reduce the Soviet armed forces by 640,000 personnel. I now report to the 20th Congress that the Ministry of Defense has fully implemented this decision on schedule. (Applause)

In addition to reducing the army, our government will also reduce military spending by nearly 10 billion rubles in 1956. We have withdrawn our troops from the military bases in Lushun (Port Arthur) and the Porkkala Peninsula and demobilized them.

In striving to ease international tensions and build trust between countries, the People's Democratic countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, also followed the example of the Soviet Union and reduced their armed forces by 180,000 personnel. All of this shows that the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are taking measures to ease international tensions not just in words but in deeds. (Applause)

The Soviet people firmly believe in the victory of Lenin's policy of international cooperation, because this policy is the only correct one. The sincere and heartfelt welcome given to Comrades Khrushchev and Bulganin by the people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan during their visits to these countries convincingly illustrates the attitude of the peoples of various countries towards Lenin's policy of international cooperation. (Applause) However, the Soviet people cannot fail to see that the policy of international cooperation is being opposed by aggressive blocs in capitalist countries. One of the main causes of international tension is the "position of strength" policy pursued by the United States, which has resulted in the arms race and various military alliances and exclusive blocs aimed at opposing the socialist camp. Although international tensions have been somewhat eased, the major capitalist countries have not reduced their armed forces. They are striving to continue to expand military blocs, increase military budgets, and continue the arms race.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council—now including the Federal Republic of Germany—at its December meeting advocated arming the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's forces with atomic weapons, further expanding the air force in Western Europe, and accelerating the arming of West Germany. American and British politicians have the highest hopes for the West German army, regarding it as the main force of the Western European army. They are sparing no effort to arm the West German army as quickly as possible, including arming it with atomic weapons. At the same time, they hope that the West German army, which is being built up, will now have the opportunity to accumulate combat experience. To this end, Heusinger, formerly a Hitler general and now chairman of the Supreme Military Council of the Federal Republic of Germany, suggested using what he called "appropriate opportunities in Algeria and Morocco," where West German troops could be trained under "modern combat conditions."

Fully consistent with the peace-threatening rhetoric of this West German military leader is the plan to establish a special paratrooper force in the West German army, which will be commanded by the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and used in the event of so-called "local conflicts." To be precise, this West German paratrooper force is being prepared to suppress peoples struggling against colonial enslavement and for national independence.

This means that the aggressive force that not long ago brought countless disasters and suffering to the people of Europe and the German people themselves is being revived in West Germany. It seems that not all of West Germany's national leaders and political activists have learned the lessons they should have from the national disaster that the German people suffered as a result of the criminal adventurist policies of Hitler and German militarists.

As for the German people, we are confident that they have not forgotten, nor will they forget, the blood that was shed in vain and the suffering and disasters they endured because of the war launched by the criminal fascist leaders. We believe that the German people will strive for peace, and they will not allow a new war to break out on the soil of their motherland. (Applause)

In the Far East, imperialists, ignoring the opposition of the Japanese people (who have suffered the devastation caused by the atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in their painful experience), have taken almost the same steps to revive Japanese militarism.

Another of the most important causes of international tension is the existence of many American military bases abroad. The United States has not eliminated any of its numerous bases in Europe, Asia, and Africa. On the contrary, it is sparing no expense to expand existing bases and build new ones.

The leaders of the United States are trying to claim that all these bases are for defensive purposes. However, anyone with a little military common sense knows that military bases thousands of kilometers away from one's own territory cannot be for defensive purposes. It must also be pointed out that the governments of countries that provide their territories to the United States as military bases are playing with fire, sacrificing the national interests of their people, and placing their lives in danger, because according to the logic of armed struggle, these bases will inevitably be subject to retaliation, no matter whose territory they are on. (Applause)

Not long ago, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles boasted in the newspapers about his country's foreign policy. Disregarding well-known facts, he tried to prove that the ceasefires in Korea and Indochina and the prevention of war in the Taiwan area were due to the "position of strength" policy and the direct threat of using atomic bombs. He even put forward his own theory of "cold war"—"standing on the edge of war without going to war." World public opinion, including progressive opinion in the United States, has given due condemnation to this peace-threatening rhetoric.

I would like to draw your attention to the repeated statements by certain American activists that the United States is determined to assist Chiang Kai-shek by force—including the use of atomic bombs—to continue to occupy China's Taiwan and other coastal islands.

As everyone knows, Taiwan belongs only to the People's Republic of China, and only the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people can decide the fate of Taiwan, not Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. government. War threats will not intimidate the Chinese people, they are not cowards, and the facts prove that they are capable of defending themselves. (Stormy applause) The Chinese people's own affairs should be solved by themselves, and no other country should interfere. If the U.S. government could move from the rhetoric of "people's right to freedom" expressed by Eisenhower and Eden in the so-called "Washington Declaration" to practical action and stop interfering in the internal affairs of China and other countries, we would heartily welcome it. (Applause)

Regrettably, the entire international activity of capitalist countries shows that certain groups in these countries are not concerned with establishing lasting peace, trust and friendship among the peoples of various countries, but are concerned with the arms race and spreading fear and distrust of the idea of peaceful coexistence with socialist countries. Therefore, I feel it is my duty to briefly report to the Congress on the main trends in the development of armed forces in several of the largest capitalist countries, primarily the United States.

They pay the most attention to atomic weapons, manufacturing various atomic weapons with particularly powerful explosive force, and designing various methods of using atomic weapons in the air force, navy, artillery, and rocket weapons.

Within the system of various military blocs, the United States monopolizes the establishment of strategic air forces and the construction of aircraft carrying atomic bombs, and intends to rely primarily on air force bases around the Soviet Union to use these aircraft. They want their partners in the military bloc to establish front-line air forces and auxiliary forces, with the West German army being built up as the main backbone. They are strengthening the equipment of the army with various armored weapons, anti-tank weapons, recoilless atomic cannons, etc. They pay special attention to studying the combat methods of the army under the conditions of using atomic weapons.

In the navy, the main focus is on manufacturing equipment to ensure long-distance maritime transport and marine landings, building anti-submarine defense equipment, and establishing carrier-based air forces. Much work has also been done on equipping surface warships and submarines with rocket weapons.

Recently, American politicians and military leaders have increasingly talked about the basis of American strategy being the use of atomic weapons for—as they put it—"tactical purposes," that is, using atomic weapons on the battlefield.

What does this statement mean? These gentlemen are considering that since the United States is geographically far away, atomic weapons will first be used in Europe, of course, as far away from the industrial centers of the United States as possible.

It seems that American monopolists also understand the reality of atomic bomb retaliation, and they do not deny that in the course of a war, this weapon of mass destruction will destroy millions of people and vast amounts of wealth in its allies—West Germany, Italy, France, Britain, and other countries.

Can this "cunning strategy" be realized? No, it cannot. In modern warfare, it is impossible not to suffer retaliation. To launch an atomic attack on the enemy, one must be prepared to receive the same, or even more powerful, retaliation. (Stormy applause)

In war, both sides are active. The era of conducting punitive wars and colonial wars in the 18th and 19th centuries is over. And the people of Europe are unlikely to be willing to work for those monopolists across the ocean who are still dreaming of taking chestnuts out of the fire with someone else's hand, as in past wars.

Comrades! The Soviet Union does not threaten anyone, nor does it want to attack anyone. But since no agreement has been reached on reducing armed forces and banning atomic weapons, since no European collective security has been established, and since lasting peace has not been reliably guaranteed, we have to have armed forces that can firmly defend the interests of our motherland, so that no provocation by the enemy can catch us off guard. (Stormy, sustained applause)

The Soviet people engaged in peaceful labor cannot but take into account the war preparations being carried out by capitalist countries. If the international situation eases and peace is further guaranteed, then we are prepared to continue reducing our armed forces.

Our starting point in the construction of the Soviet armed forces is that the methods and forms of future wars will be very different from all past wars. If a war occurs in the future, there will be large-scale use of air forces, various rocket weapons, and various weapons with a wide range of attacks, such as atomic weapons, thermonuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons. But we believe that the most modern weapons, including weapons with a wide range of attacks, will not diminish the decisive role of the army, navy, and air force. Without a strong army, without strategic air forces, long-range air forces, and front-line air forces, without a modern navy, and without their well-organized mutual coordination, it will not be possible to win a modern war victoriously.

Thanks to the Party and the government's constant concern for our country's defense capabilities, the Soviet armed forces have been completely re-equipped, and their quality has far exceeded the level at the end of the Great Patriotic War. The continuously growing capabilities of the Soviet economy, especially the tremendous achievements of heavy industry, have enabled us to re-equip our army, navy, and air force with first-class military technology. The organization and training of the army are carried out in accordance with the conditions of using the latest military technology. In our armed forces, the proportion of the air force and air defense forces has greatly increased. The army has been fully mechanized and motorized. The Soviet armed forces now possess various atomic and thermonuclear weapons, a variety of powerful rocket and jet weapons, including long-range rockets. (Applause) Infantry regiments have been re-equipped with new, more powerful weapons and have been fully motorized. The infantry units have high-quality tanks and self-propelled artillery. The combat effectiveness, mobility, and independent action capabilities of mechanized units and tank units exceed the level of the previous war. We have also made tremendous achievements in improving the quality of artillery.

The Party Central Committee and the government pay special attention to the development of the air force, believing that it is an extremely important means of ensuring the security of our motherland. Now, we have the latest jet fleet, which can accomplish all tasks when the aggressor attacks. (Applause)

Our starting point in naval construction is that the role of surface combat will be much greater in future wars than in past wars. Now, our navy, together with the army and air force, can reliably defend our country's maritime borders. We also estimate the actual threat from the air, especially the development of long-range rockets and jet strategic fleets. Therefore, we have carried out a tremendous amount of work in organizing our country's air defense. Now, air defense has modern supersonic fighter fleets, the best anti-aircraft artillery, anti-aircraft rocket artillery, and other air defense weapons.

Comrades! Please allow me, on behalf of the armed forces, to express our sincere gratitude to the scientists, designers, workers, engineers, and technicians of our country's defense industry, because they are using selfless creative labor to ensure the supply of high-level technology and equipment to the Soviet army, air force, and navy. (Applause)

In recent years, in the army, air force, and navy, we have done a lot of work to train the army how to conduct war under the conditions of using atomic weapons and other new combat weapons. The various arms and units of the armed forces have also conducted the necessary exercises to complete combat missions in complex situations on the ground, in the air, and at sea.

The superiority of Soviet military science, which has always been guided by Marxist-Leninist theory, has guaranteed our victory in the Great Patriotic War in many ways. In the post-war period, Soviet military science integrated the experience of the war and the subsequent technological development, and on this basis, it proposed the correct direction for the construction and training of our armed forces.

We estimate the future progress of science and technology, as well as the emergence of new offensive weapons and military technology. Therefore, in the future, we must also adopt the most timely methods and forms of armed combat, comprehensively study them, and apply them to our army's exercises.

We believe that military technology, even the most effective military technology itself, can never determine the outcome of battles and campaigns, and can never win victory. In future wars, the victory or defeat of the war will be determined by those who fully master military technology, are convinced of the correctness of their war aims, are infinitely loyal to their government, and are always ready to guarantee the interests of their people. (Applause)

Since the 19th Congress, the commanders, political departments, and party organizations of the armed forces, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, have achieved further achievements in the political and military education of all members. However, we still need to do a lot of work to improve the party's political work in the army, and we must strive to closely link this work with the practical tasks of improving the quality of the army's combat training and strengthening military discipline.

The Soviet armed forces have experienced cadres who can victoriously complete the task of training and educating the army. The commanders and leaders of our various arms and units are marshals, generals, and officers who have made numerous achievements. They have rich combat experience in the Patriotic War, and they have repeatedly proven their ability to command the army victoriously in battles and campaigns. (Applause)

Comrades, I should be pleased to point out that the young people who have enlisted in the army in recent years have been able to master modern complex combat technology in a shorter period of time due to their higher level of education, technology, and culture. This situation has played a major role in improving the combat effectiveness of the army.

Due to troop reductions, a portion of young people of military age will not be conscripted into the army in the future. We should take measures to ensure that young people who are not conscripted can learn the military technology necessary to fulfill their obligations to defend the motherland outside the army. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the work of the National Defense Volunteer Group. The Communist Youth League, schools in the education system, and labor reserve schools should do everything possible to cultivate our young people into physically able, hardworking, and disciplined youth, so that they have a communist attitude towards labor, love and are loyal to their people, and are always ready to gloriously defend our socialist motherland. (Applause)

The task of defending the national rear has never been as urgent as it is under current conditions. The security of the Soviet people requires continued efforts to improve local air defense work and to improve the training of all residents accordingly, in accordance with the civil organization system.

Comrades! The armed forces of the great People's Republic of China and other People's Democratic countries are defending peace and the security of their people together with the Soviet armed forces. (Sustained applause) Our army and the armies of our allies are a true military family of fraternal friendship. They are fighting for the bright future of their people and are willing to sacrifice their lives to defend the vital interests of their people. This is our strength, and this is where we are superior to the armed forces of the capitalist camp. (Stormy applause)

Comrades! Please allow me to assure the 20th Congress of our beloved Communist Party, the Soviet government, all our people, and all our friends that the Soviet armed forces are always ready to gloriously fulfill their obligations to the motherland. (Stormy, sustained applause)

### 朱可夫在苏共代表大会上的发言

专栏：

    朱可夫在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！苏联人民用来迎接我们党的第二十次代表大会工作的巨大的政治和劳动热潮，证明了苏联人民对共产党的政策的无限信任和完全拥护，这是因为共产党不倦地领导了保卫人民的利益、争取共产主义在我国的胜利和争取世界和平的斗争。（掌声）
    武装部队的全体成员，正像全体苏联人民一样，在第二十次代表大会召开的时候，紧密地团结在自己亲爱的共产党的周围。苏联军人对自己的人民、对共产党和苏联政府无限忠诚，他们时时刻刻准备着光荣而出色履行保卫我们可爱祖国的军人职责。（掌声）
    同志们！党和政府尽了一切力量来保卫和平，巩固各国人民之间的信任和友谊。为了缓和国际紧张局势和树立各国之间的信任，苏联政府曾经建议裁减军备、禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器，同时还采取了裁减自己武装部队的具体措施。去年8月，苏联政府曾经通过裁减苏联武装部队64万人的决定。我现在向第二十次代表大会报告：国防部已经完全按期执行了这一决定。（掌声）
    除了裁减军队之外，我们的政府还要在1956年缩减军事开支将近100亿卢布。我们把军队从旅顺口和波卡拉半岛的军事基地撤了回来，并且把他们复员了。
    为了力求缓和国际紧张局势和树立各国之间的信任，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚等人民民主国家，也仿效苏联的榜样，裁减了军队18万人。所有这一切都说明，苏联和人民民主国家不是在口头上而是在实际上采取了缓和国际紧张局势的措施。（掌声）
    苏联人民坚信列宁的国际合作政策的胜利，因为这个政策是唯一正确的政策。印度、缅甸和阿富汗等国的人民对赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志访问这些国家时所表示的诚挚的衷心的欢迎，令人信服地说明了各国人民对列宁的国际合作政策的态度。（掌声）然而，苏联人民不能不看到，国际合作的政策正受到资本主义国家中的侵略集团的反对。造成国际紧张局势的最主要的原因之一，就是美国所奉行的“实力地位”政策，这个政策造成军备竞赛，造成各种以反对社会主义阵营为目的的军事联盟和排他性集团。尽管国际紧张局势已经得到了某些缓和，但是，主要的资本主义国家却没有裁减自己的军队。它们竭力继续扩大军事集团，扩大军事预算和继续进行军备竞赛。
    北大西洋集团理事会——现在德意志联邦共和国也参加了这个理事会——12月会议主张用原子武器武装北大西洋公约组织的军队，主张进一步扩大西欧的空军，并且主张加速武装西德。美国和英国的政治家们对西德的军队抱着最大的指望，把它们当作西欧陆军的主力。他们不惜以任何手段，尽速武装西德的军队，包括以原子武器来武装他们。同时他们希望正在建立起来的西德军队现在就获得机会来积累作战经验。为了这个目的，从前是希特勒的将军而现在是德意志联邦共和国最高军事会议主席的豪辛格，建议利用像他所说的“在阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥的适当时机”，在那里，西德军队可以受到“现代战斗条件下”的训练。
    同这位西德的军事领导者的危害和平事业的言论完全一致的，是在西德军队中建立一支特殊的伞兵部队的计划，这支部队将由北大西洋公约组织最高统帅部指挥，而在发生所谓“地方冲突”时使用。确切些说，西德的这种伞兵部队就是准备用来镇压为反对殖民奴役和争取民族独立而斗争的人民。
    这就是说，这个不久以前曾经给欧洲各国人民和德国人民本身带来数不尽的灾祸和苦难的侵略力量，又在西德复活。看来，并不是所有西德的国家领导人和政治活动家都已经从那次由于希特勒和德国军国主义者实行罪恶的冒险政策而使德国人民遭受到的民族灾难中吸取了应有的教训。
    至于德国人民，那我们深信他们没有忘记、也不会忘记因为罪恶的法西斯领导者发动战争而使他们白白流出的鲜血，以及使
  他们遭受的痛苦和灾难。我们相信，德国人民将努力为和平而斗
  争，他们不会允许在自己祖国的土地上爆发新的战争。（掌声）
    在远东，帝国主义者不顾日本人民（他们在自己痛苦的经历
  中曾经遭受过投在长崎和广岛的原子弹所造成的破坏）的反对，也采取了差不多同样的步骤来复活日本军国主义。
    造成国际紧张局势的另一个最重要的原因是美国在国外拥有许多军事基地。美国在欧洲、亚洲和非洲的许许多多的基地一个也没有取消，相反地，它还不惜金钱来扩大基地和建立新的基地。
    美国国家的领导人企图把这一切基地硬说成是为了防御的目的。然而，任何一个稍有军事常识的人都懂得，远离本国领土数千公里以外的军事基地不可能是为了防御的目的。还不能不指出，把本国的领土供美国作军事基地的国家的政府是在玩火，是在牺牲本国人民的民族利益，把他们的生命置于危险的境地，因为按照武力斗争的逻辑，这些基地一定会受到回击，不论这些基地是在谁的领土上。（掌声）
    不久以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经在报上吹嘘本国的对外政策。他不顾人所共知的事实，企图证明，好像是由于“实力地位”的政策和使用原子弹的直接恐吓，才促成了朝鲜和印度支那的停战，才防止了台湾地区战争的爆发。他甚至还提出了自己的一套
  “冷战”理论——“站在战争的边缘上而不进行战争”。全世界的广大舆论，包括美国的进步舆论在内，对这种危害和平的言论都给予了应有的谴责。
    我想请大家注意美国某些活动家多次重申的声明：美国决心以武力——包括使用原子弹在内——协助蒋介石继续占据中国的台湾和沿海其他岛屿。
    大家知道，台湾只是属于中华人民共和国的，可以支配台湾命运的只有中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，而不是蒋介石和美国政府。战争威胁吓不倒中国人民，他们不是胆小鬼，事实证明，他们是能够保卫住自己的。（暴风雨般的掌声）中国人民自己的事务，应当由自己解决，不需要其他国家干涉。如果美国政府能够从艾森豪威尔和艾登在所谓“华盛顿声明”中所发表的“人有获得自由的权利”的言论转到实际的行动，停止对中国和其他国家的内部事务的干涉，我们将表示衷心的欢迎。（掌声）
    很遗憾，资本主义国家的全部国际活动表明，这些国家的某些集团所关心的不是在各国人民之间建立持久的和平，建立信任和友谊，而是关心军备竞赛，散布恐惧心理和不信任能够同社会主义阵营各个国家和平共处的思想。因此，我认为有责任向代表大会简要地报告一下几个最大的资本主义国家，首先是美国在发展武装力量方面的主要趋向。
    他们最注意的是原子武器，和制造各种各样有特别猛烈爆炸力的原子武器，设计各种把原子武器用于空军、海军、大炮和火箭武器的方法。
    在各种军事集团的系统中，美国把战略空军的建立和装载原子弹的飞机的建造垄断在自己手中，并且打算主要依靠分布在苏联周围的空军基地来使用这些飞机。他们要自己的军事集团中的伙伴们建立前线空军和辅助部队，而把正在建立起来的西德军队作为主要骨干。他们用各种装甲武器、反坦克武器、无后座力原子炮等来加强陆军的装备。他们特别注意研究军队在使用原子武器的条件下的作战方法。
    在海军方面，主要是制造保证远距离海运和海军陆战队登陆的装备，建造反潜水艇的防御装备和建立舰载空军。在用火箭武器装备水面军舰和潜水艇方面也做了不少工作。
    最近，美国的政治家和军事家越来越多地谈到，美国的战略的根据应当是把原子武器用于——像他们所说的——“战术的目的”，这就是说，把原子武器用于战场上。
    这种说法包含着什么意思呢？这些先生们考虑到，既然美国在地理上离得很远，那末原子武器就首先会在欧洲使用，当然，离美国的工业中心城市愈远愈好。
    看来，美国的垄断资本家们也懂得原子弹回击的现实性，而他们也不否认，在战争过程中，这种杀人武器会毁灭他的盟国——西德、意大利、法国、英国和其他国家——的千百万人口和大量的财富。
    这种“狡猾的战略”能不能实现呢？不，不能。在现代的战争中，不遭受回击是不可能的。要想对敌人进行原子攻击，就要准备受到同样的、甚至是更有力的回击。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在战争中，作战双方都是能动的。18世纪和19世纪进行讨伐战争和殖民战争的时代已经过去了。而欧洲各国的人民，也未必愿意为那些仍在梦想着像在过去的战争中一样，借别人的手从火中取栗的大洋彼岸的垄断资本家们卖命。
    同志们！苏联不威胁任何人，也不想攻击任何人。但是由于还没有达成一个关于裁减武装部队和禁止原子武器的协定，由于欧洲集体安全还没有建立，以及持久和平还没有得到可靠的保障，所以我们不得不拥有能够牢固地保卫我们祖国利益的武装部队，使敌人的任何挑衅都不致使我们措手不及。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    进行着和平劳动的苏联人民不能够不考虑到资本主义国家在进行的战争准备。如果国际局势缓和下来，而和平有了新的保障，那我们就准备继续裁减我们的武装部队。
    我们在苏联武装部队的建设方面的出发点是，未来的战争的方法和形式都会大大不同于过去的一切战争。将来如果发生战争，就会大规模地使用空军、各种火箭武器和各种袭击范围很广的武器，例如原子武器、热核子武器、化学武器和细菌武器。但是我们认为，最新式的武器，包括袭击范围很广的武器在内，都不致缩小陆、海、空军的决定作用。没有强大的陆军，没有战略空军、远程空军和前线空军，没有现代的海军，没有它们之间很有组织的互相配合，就不能够胜利地进行现代的战争。
    由于党和政府对我国国防能力的经常关怀，苏联武装部队得到了彻底的改装，它的质量已经远远超过了伟大卫国战争末期的水平。苏联经济不断增长的能力，首先是重工业的巨大成就，使我们能够用头等的军事技术改装我们的陆军、海军和空军。军队的组织和训练都是按照使用最新的军事技术条件来进行的。在我们的武装部队中，空军和防空部队的比重大大增加了。陆军实现了全部机械化、摩托化。苏联的武装部队现在已经拥有各种不同的原子武器和热核子武器，多种强大的火箭和喷气式武器，其中包括远距离火箭。（掌声）步兵兵团已经由新的、更有力的武器来重新装备，并且已经全部摩托化。在步兵的编制中有高质量的坦克和自动炮。机械化兵团、坦克兵团的战斗力、机动性和独立行动的能力，都超过了上次战争时期的水平。我们在改进炮兵质量方面也获得了巨大的成就。
    党中央委员会和政府特别注意空军的发展，认为它是保障我们祖国安全的极重要手段。现在，我们拥有最新型的喷气式机队，它能够在侵略者进袭的时候完成一切任务。（掌声）
    我们在海军建设中的出发点是，海面战斗在未来战争中的作用将比在过去战争中大得多。现在，我们的海军，和陆军、空军在一起，能够牢靠地保卫我们祖国的海上边界。我们也估计到来自空中的实际威胁，特别是远距离火箭以及喷气式战略机队的发展，因此我们进行了组织我国空防的巨大工作。现在，空防拥有现代化的超音速歼击机队、最好的高射炮兵、高射火箭炮以及其他防空武器。
    同志们！请允许我代表武装部队向我国国防工业的科学家、设计师、工人、工程师、技师等致以崇高的谢意，因为他们在以忘我的创造性的劳动来保证供应苏联陆军、空军、海军以高度水平的技术和装备。（掌声）
    近几年来，在陆军、空军和海军方面，我们进行了许多工作，训练军队如何在使用原子武器和其他新式战斗武器时的条件下进行战争。武装部队的各种兵团和部队还进行了在地面、空中和海上的复杂情况下完成战斗任务的必要演习。
    永远以马克思列宁主义理论为指南的苏联军事科学的优越性，在许多方面保证了我们在伟大卫国战争中的胜利。在战后一个时期内，苏联军事科学综合了战争的经验和后来技术的发展，并且在这一基础上提出了建设和训练我国武装部队的正确方向。
    我们估计到未来的科学技术的进步，以及新的袭击武器和军事技术的出现，因此，我们今后也必须及时地采用最合时的武装战斗方式和形式，全面地研究它们，并且运用到我们的军队的演习中。
    我们认为，军事技术，甚至是最有成效的军事技术本身总不能决定战斗和战役的结局，总不能获得胜利。在未来战争中，战争的胜负是由那些充分掌握军事技术、深信自己战争目的的正确、无限忠诚于自己政府并且随时随刻准备保障自己人民利益的人决定的。（掌声）
    从第十九次代表大会到现在，武装部队的指挥员、政治部和党组织，在党中央委员会的领导下，在对全体成员的政治教育和军事教育方面，获得了进一步的成就，但是在改进军队中整个党的政治工作上，我们还需要做很多事，要力求把这一工作和提高
  军队战斗训练的质量以及巩固军纪的实际任务紧密地联系起来。
    苏联武装部队拥有富有经验的干部，他们能够胜利地完成训练和教育军队的任务。我们各兵团和各级部队的司令员、指挥员，都是一些屡建功绩的元帅、将军和军官，他们具有卫国战争的丰富战斗经验，他们不止一次地证明了自己有在战斗和战役中胜利地指挥军队的能力。（掌声）
    同志们，我应该满意地指出，最近几年应征入伍的青年，由于他们的教育程度、技术水平和文化水平较高，因而能够在更短时期内掌握现代的复杂的战斗技术，这种情况在提高军队的战斗力方面起了重大的作用。
    由于裁减兵员，今后一部分适龄青年将不征召入伍。我们应当采取一些办法，使没有征召入伍的青年能够在军队外面学到为履行自己保卫祖国的义务所必需的军事技术。因此，就要求进一步改善支援陆海空军志愿协会的工作。列宁共产主义青年团、教育部系统的学校和劳动后备学校应该尽一切力量，把我国的青年教养成体力上能够刻苦耐劳、纪律性很强的青年，使他们具有共产主义的劳动态度，热爱和忠于自己的人民，随时准备光荣地保卫我们的社会主义祖国。（掌声）
    保卫国家后方的任务，从来没有像在目前条件下这样迫切。苏联人民的安全要求继续努力改善地方的防空工作，并且相应地按照公民组织系统改进对全体居民的训练工作。
    同志们！伟大的中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的武装力量，正和苏联的武装力量一起保卫着和平和自己人民的安全。
  （经久不息的掌声）我们的军队和我们的同盟者的军队是真正的兄弟友爱的军人大家庭，他们为自己人民的光辉的未来而斗争，并且不惜牺牲自己的生命来保卫自己人民的切身利益。这就是我们的力量，这就是我们比资本主义阵营的武装力量优越的地方。
  （暴风雨般的掌声）
    同志们！请允许我向我们亲爱的共产党的第二十次代表大会、苏联政府、我们的全体人民和我们所有的朋友们保证，苏联的武装力量随时准备着光荣地履行自己对祖国的义务。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
