    Xi'an City has comprehensively arranged the production of handicraft production cooperatives.

    The supply and marketing department of the Xi'an Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperative Union has successively assigned production tasks for the entire year, the first half of the year, or the first quarter to production cooperatives and groups in 11 major handicraft industries, including ironware, woodwork, clothing, canvas, and leather making. State-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies, department stores, and other companies have continued to place processing orders with handicraft industries that originally implemented processing orders, ensuring that the production of handicraft cooperatives in these industries remains normal.

    After these arrangements, the production of many handicraft cooperatives in Xi'an City has gradually returned to normal in the past month. All 56 ironware production cooperatives and groups in the city have begun to produce more than 2,000 cotton strip seeding machines and a large number of new-style waterwheels and sprayers for the first time. Leather production cooperatives are actively improving product quality, and the various types of leather they have trial-produced have met the specified standards. This year, they will supply all the leather needed for shoe making, leather goods, etc. in the city, changing the situation in which 60% of the leather needed by Xi'an City in the past had to be purchased from other places. After the production of the First Sugar Production Cooperative was arranged by the Shaanxi Provincial State-Owned Department Store Company, the cooperative members actively proposed specific methods to improve operating techniques, increasing the daily sugar output from 1,800 jin to 2,600 jin and completely eliminating defective products.

    西安市全面安排手工业生产
    西安市已经全面安排好手工业生产合作组织的生产。
    市手工业生产合作社联合社供销经理部，已陆续对铁器、木器、服装、帆布、制革等11个主要手工业行业的生产合作社、组，分别布置了今年全年、今年上半年或第一季度的生产任务。国营花纱布、百货等公司已对原来实行加工订货的手工业行业继续进行加工订货，使这些行业的手工业合作组织的生产一直保持正常。
    经过这些安排以后，近一个月来西安市不少手工业合作组织的生产已逐步纳入正轨。全市56个铁器生产合作社、组，已经第一次开始生产两千多部棉花条播机和大批新式水车、喷雾器。制革业生产合作组织正在积极提高产品质量，它们试制的各种皮革已达到规定标准。今年他们将供应全市制鞋、皮件等所需的全部皮革，以改变西安市过去60％的皮革要从外地购进的情况。第一制糖生产合作社的生产经陕西省国营百货公司安排后，社员们纷纷提出改进操作技术的具体办法，使糖的日产量由1，800斤提高到2，600斤，并且完全消灭了次品。
