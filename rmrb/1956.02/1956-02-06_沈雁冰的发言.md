    Chairman, fellow members, fellow comrades:
    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's "Political Report," as well as the special reports by Vice-Chairmen Li, Guo, Chen, and Dong, and Comrade Chen Boda. I suggest that the conference adopt them.
    This meeting is preparing to focus on discussing the issue of intellectuals. I am an intellectual working in the field of literature and art and would like to express some opinions in this regard.
    Literary and art workers have the task of reflecting reality and educating the people. In recent years, literature and art have made achievements, but they still lag far behind reality. In recent years, the self-education of literary and art workers has also been fruitful. The vast majority of literary and art workers are able to sincerely serve the people. However, due to the particularity of literature and art, it is not enough to have sincere aspirations without rapid improvement in professional skills to meet the urgent need of the broad masses for spiritual sustenance. Writers and artists are "engineers of the human soul." To be worthy of this glorious title, writers and artists must not only master techniques, but more importantly, have a progressive worldview. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, literary and art workers across the country have participated in great movements such as land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns, and especially last year's movement to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and oppose bourgeois idealism, which greatly improved the political and ideological levels of literary and art workers. The current problem is to continue studying Marxism-Leninism on this basis, while combining it with experiencing life and artistic practice, to further complete ideological transformation.
    The social changes in our country's transition period are so rapid, so broad, and so complex. What the people demand of literature and art is to reflect reality promptly and quickly, and to reflect reality from all aspects and in a colorful way.
    The people do not like formulaic, conceptualized, and monotonous things. Our task is glorious, but also extremely arduous. We cannot have any complacency.
    There are approximately six thousand senior intellectuals in the cultural and artistic fields across the country. This number is very disproportionate to our large country with six hundred million people. However, the potential power of these six thousand people has not yet been fully realized. Even more importantly, the new force in our country's cultural and artistic fields is very strong, and cultivating this new force is the sacred social responsibility of the six thousand senior cultural and artistic intellectuals. We have not done this work well enough in the past, and we must complete it as an important political task in the future.
    Literary and art workers warmly support the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision on the issue of intellectuals. We are willing to work together with various democratic parties, people's organizations, and other parties, under the leadership of the Party, to do a good job of overall planning, solve existing problems, and enable the strength of intellectuals to be fully utilized and developed.
    Chairman Zhou Enlai said in his political report: "The alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in our country in the cause of socialism will become more and more consolidated day by day. Relying on the strength of this alliance, we will definitely be able to over fulfill our country's industrial development plan and accelerate the technological transformation of the national economy."
    Comrades and friends: These words of Chairman Zhou Enlai are a great encouragement and a great honor for intellectuals; and we intellectuals must learn from our elder brothers, the workers and peasants, strive to study, strive for self-reform, and make greater, more, and better contributions to the socialist cause of the motherland.

    沈雁冰的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的“政治报告”，李、郭、陈、董四位副主席和陈伯达委员的专题报告。并建议大会予以通过。
    这次会议准备着重地讨论知识分子问题，我是在文学艺术方面工作的一个知识分子，愿意在这方面发表一点意见。
    文学艺术工作者负有反映现实、教育人民的任务。几年来，文学艺术是有成就的，但还远远落在现实的后面。几年来，文学艺术工作者的自我教育也是有成就的，极大多数的文学艺术工作者能够真诚地为人民服务，但由于文学艺术的特殊性，光有真诚的志愿而业务上不能迅速提高，还是不能满足广大人民对于精神食粮的迫切的需要。文学家和艺术家是“人类灵魂的工程师”，要无愧于这个光荣的称号，文学家艺术家就不但要掌握技巧，尤其重要的是要有进步的世界观。几年以来，在党的领导下，全国文学艺术工作者参加了土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、三反、五反等伟大运动，特别是去年的肃清胡风反革命集团和反对资产阶级唯心主义的运动，大大提高了文学艺术工作者的政治水平和思想水平。现在的问题是在这一基础上继续学习马克思列宁主义，同时并与体验生活和艺术实践结合起来，进一步完成思想改造。
    我国过渡时期的社会变革，是那样的猛迅，那样的博大，又那样的错综复杂。人民所要求于文学艺术的，是及时地迅速地反映现实，是从各方面、多姿多采地反映现实。
    人民不喜欢公式化、概念化、千篇一律的东西。我们的任务是光荣的，同时也是极其艰巨的。我们不能有丝毫的自满情绪。
    全国的文化艺术方面的高级知识分子约有六千余人。这一个数目，和我们六亿人民这样一个大国，是很不相称的。但是，这六千人的潜在力量也还没有完全发挥。还有更重要的一点：我国文化艺术方面的新生力量是十分雄厚的，培养新生力量是六千余文化艺术的高级知识分子的神圣的社会责任。这项工作，我们过去做得很不够，今后必须把它作为重要的政治任务来完成它。
    文学艺术工作者热烈地拥护中共中央关于知识分子问题的决定。我们愿意和各民主党派、人民团体，以及其他方面，共同努力，在党的领导下，做好全面规划，解决存在着的问题，使知识分子的力量得到充分的发挥和成长。
    周恩来主席在政治报告中说：“我国工人、农民和知识分子在社会主义事业中的联盟将一天比一天巩固。我们依靠这个联盟的力量，一定可以超额完成我国的工业发展计划和加速进行国民经济的技术改造。”
    同志们和朋友们：周恩来主席的这几句话，对于知识分子是极大的鼓励，也是极大的荣誉；而我们知识分子也就更要向我们的老大哥工人和农民看齐，努力学习，努力自我改造，为祖国的社会主义事业作出更大、更多、更好的贡献。
