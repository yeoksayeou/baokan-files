Fellow Committee Members and Comrades:

The figures and detailed analyses presented by Chairman Zhou Enlai in his report convincingly demonstrate that the Chinese people have achieved decisive victories on all fronts of socialist transformation over the past six months. Under this victorious situation, our discussion and acceptance of the many new tasks before us indicate that we not only should but also can push our great cause forward "more, faster, better, and more economically."

These tasks bring even greater and more glorious responsibilities to the youth of the nation. I would like to offer some opinions on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Youth Federation. I request the Chairman to grant me a few more minutes.

I want to start with agriculture. Because our Party regards the 100 million rural youths of the country as active elements and shock forces in building a new socialist countryside. The facts of the past six months have proven that these rural youths, who listen to the Party and are full of energy, have indeed lived up to the Party's expectations. For example, last autumn and winter, 66 million young people across the country formed 180,000 youth afforestation teams, planting more than 2.1 billion trees of various kinds on 5.46 million mu of barren hills and wastelands. Also, during the same period, 70 million young people across the country launched a campaign to collect green grass and pond silt for fertilizer, accumulating over 350 billion jin of fertilizer. Furthermore, in the large-scale well-digging campaign since last winter, young people displayed the highest level of enthusiasm. In Shandong Province alone, out of the 400,000 wells dug, more than 244,000 were dug by youth shock teams. Again, in the recently launched campaign to eliminate sparrows and rats, according to statistics from 248 counties in nine provinces and cities, young people and children in these areas have already eliminated more than 15.5 million of them. There are many similar examples, but I cannot list them all due to time constraints. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League is currently holding a meeting of secretaries of the League's provincial and municipal committees. The meeting has already formulated 26 plans based on the National Agricultural Development Outline, which we intend to name "The Struggle Program of Chinese Youth to Realize the National Agricultural Development Outline from 1956 to 1967." We believe that as long as we carry out practical organizational work, we will certainly be able to direct the production enthusiasm of rural youth across the country to a new high tide.

I want to move on to the issue of children of the bourgeoisie in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. There are approximately 1.7 million young people who are children of the bourgeoisie in the country. Among them, 500,000 have already joined the workforce in various national construction sectors, 800,000 are studying in universities and secondary schools, more than 100,000 are serving in their original capitalist enterprises, and 200,000 are unemployed at home due to lack of labor skills or other reasons. In addition, about 70,000 have inherited their parents' and brothers' businesses and become capitalists. Over the past few years, they have experienced from their own lives the care of our Party for them and witnessed the flourishing scene of the motherland. The majority of them not only can distinguish between exploitation and labor, and strive to train themselves to become self-reliant individuals, but also can actively help their parents and brothers accept joint state-private ownership in this upsurge of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. We have also seen that a large number of young capitalists can actively "take control of their own destiny," stand at the forefront of accepting socialist transformation, and become activists in joint state-private ownership. Our current task is to encourage those young people in the industrial and commercial sectors who have already accepted joint state-private ownership to continue to play a leading role in the inventory of assets, unified arrangements, and improved production; we must systematically help those among them who lack labor skills or have low labor skills to learn and improve the skills needed to build socialism; we must also help them study Marxism-Leninism and use Marxism-Leninism to transform and improve themselves. For those who truly meet the requirements for joining the League, we will admit them into the League in accordance with the League's charter. We believe that as long as they make the same efforts and are determined to be great socialist children, they will certainly be able to become promising members of the great ranks of building the motherland.

I want to focus on how Chinese youth, especially intellectual youth, should march towards science and culture.

Our Party and Chairman Mao have called on us to quickly catch up with the advanced level of world science in order to rapidly change our country's backwardness in economy, science, and culture. In our view, this is not only a call to the older generation of intellectuals but also a great call to the entire younger generation of China. If we consider how rapidly science is advancing in the world today, how far behind our country's science still lags, how poor the scientific heritage left by old China is, and how small the number of older generation scientists is, we feel even more deeply the profound significance of this great call for Chinese youth.

Our country now has 2.8 million young intellectuals with a high school education or above, of which approximately 900,000 have a university or college degree or above. This is the new generation of intellectuals in our country and the direct reserve force of our country's senior intellectuals. For several years, the vast number of young intellectuals have actively responded to the call of the Party and the state, vigorously learning from the Soviet Union, learning from the older generation, and marching towards science and culture. Now, 200,000 of them have become excellent engineering and technical personnel in our country, 70,000 have become excellent agricultural technicians, 80,000 have become excellent medical workers, 50,000 have become excellent financial and trade cadres, 100,000 have become excellent people's teachers in secondary schools and above, 30,000 have become excellent literary and artistic workers and athletes, and another 100,000 are working in other state organs.

Why have our young intellectuals grown so quickly? If we were to answer in one sentence, it would be that they can advance according to the only correct path indicated by the Party.

Advancing according to the only correct path indicated by the Party is primarily reflected in their ability to combine the ardent desire and lofty ideals of marching towards science with a tenacious spirit of struggle. They can study diligently and strive to digest what they have learned; they can humbly learn from their elders but are not satisfied with the achievements of their predecessors and dare to create boldly; they never get discouraged at any time and dare to declare war on all difficulties in their advance; they can consistently infuse the belief taught by the Party, that only those who follow the times without hesitation or nostalgia are invincible.

Advancing according to the only correct path indicated by the Party is also reflected in their ability to correctly balance studying their own professional work and caring about politics. They understand that our Party wants them to become all kinds of red experts proficient in their own professions, so they can spend more time studying the science and technology of their own professions. At the same time, they also know that as a socialist vanguard fighter, they must care about politics, and not caring about politics can only make them selfish or short-sighted mediocrities, so they can care about the fate of the country and the people at any time and any place, subordinate personal interests to the overall interests of the people, and consciously and happily study dialectical materialism and historical materialism, strive to grasp the laws of social development, and strive to understand our Party's basic policies and policies related to their work. It is precisely because they can do this that they often feel warmth in their work and feel an endless force guiding them to rush forward.

However, we are by no means saying that all intellectual youth have done this. Among them, there are also "lazy people" and those who fear difficulties, fantasizing that there are super-intelligent airplanes in the world that can be used to climb the peaks of science and culture without having to study hard. There are also those who are calculating about personal gains and losses and therefore cannot treat their work and the things around them with a spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. What we want to emphasize is that there are still many young comrades who have incorrect views about the older generation of intellectuals. They often only see the shortcomings of many older predecessors and underestimate their progress, especially failing to see that the knowledge and experience of many older predecessors in science and technology are worthy of their own learning and respect. It is precisely because some of our young comrades have this incorrect understanding that many older predecessors who want to pass on their knowledge and experience to the younger generation with full enthusiasm cannot happily and freely impart to these young comrades. We must resolutely correct this deviation. We should make every effort to make all intellectual youth understand that they must humbly learn from all knowledgeable predecessors. Only in this way can Chinese youth inherit all the useful knowledge and valuable heritage of the motherland, as the Party has taught.

Marching towards science and culture also requires more and more young people to become a strong source of senior intellectuals. Now our Party is adopting the following three methods to expand the ranks of senior intellectuals: one method is to tap the potential of universities and increase the number of university students; another method is to organize the millions of middle-level intellectuals who have already joined the workforce and production to seriously use their spare time to study hard, so that they can be promoted from middle-level to senior-level in a few years; and another method is to eliminate illiteracy and implement compulsory education among teenagers as early as possible, so that they can also continuously replenish the ranks of intellectuals in a few years. These are indeed three good methods. If we follow these three methods, it means that we have organized three huge reserve echelons for our march towards science. Together with the front echelon of 100,000 senior intellectuals, we have four powerful troops, and we can take down any of the most solid scientific fortresses with effort. To achieve this, first, our Communist Youth League must strengthen the work of the League in universities and secondary vocational schools and strive to assist school administrations in improving the quality of teaching. The students studying in these schools must give play to a higher enthusiasm for learning and study hard in order to cultivate themselves into useful talents for the country. To achieve this, second, we must seriously cooperate with the education departments and trade unions to lead young people's spare-time learning and advanced studies by running spare-time universities and organizing various science groups, holding scientific and technological conferences, and so on. According to Soviet statistics from 1932 to 1937, about half of the new experts in the Soviet Union at that time were trained in spare-time schools. The millions of ordinary young intellectuals who are now at their work posts should also have the same confidence that they can turn themselves into red experts proficient in their own professions by using their spare time to study hard. To achieve this, third, we must also seriously cooperate with the education departments and the Women's Federation to grasp the work of eliminating illiteracy. Since last winter, the number of people participating in literacy studies in cities and rural areas has more than doubled compared to the previous year, and millions of people have joined literacy organizations. However, we believe that this is still far from enough, and we must make the literacy movement more vigorously developed.

In order to march towards science and culture, we must also greatly promote the efforts of cadres holding various positions to study scientific knowledge in their own fields. Our youth organizations have this advantage, that they are in all departments, and "although the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs." We believe that as long as our cadres seriously study the scientific knowledge of their own fields in their work, as long as we understand more Marxism-Leninism and more natural science, as Chairman Mao has instructed, we can do our work more solidly and can unite and help young professionals of various kinds better.

Fellow Committee Members and Comrades: At this meeting, we all feel infinite excitement. Because turning our country into a large country with a prosperous economy, developed science, and flourishing culture is not a distant wish, but a cause that our generation is fully confident of achieving. We should thank the great Marxism-Leninism and the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In this great time, we deeply believe that the entire younger generation of China will emit greater light and heat and run towards the goals expected by our Party and the country.

    胡耀邦的发言
    各位委员和各位同志：
    周恩来主席在报告中所列举的数字和详尽的分析，使人信服地看到，这半年多以来，我国人民在社会主义改造的各个战线上，都取得了决定性的胜利。在这个胜利的局面下，我们大家来讨论和接受摆在我们面前的许多新任务，这就指明，我们不但应该而且可能把我们伟大的事业“又多、又快、又好、又省”地推向前进。
    这些任务，给全国青年带来了更重大和更光荣的责任。我代表青年团中央和全国青联说些意见。要求主席多给我几分钟时间。
    我要先从农业讲起。因为我们的党把全国一亿农村青年看作是建设社会主义新农村中的活动分子和突击力量。半年来的事实证明，我们这批听了党的话浑身都是劲的农村青年，确实没有辜负党的期望。例如，去年秋冬两季，全国就有6，600万青年组成了18万个青年造林队，在546万亩的荒山荒地上，种植了各种树木21亿多株。又如，在同一时间内，全国有7，000万青年掀起了向青草向塘泥进军的千车万担的积肥运动，共积肥3，500多亿斤。再如，在去年冬季以来的大规模的打井运动中，青年们发挥了最高的积极性，单是山东一省所打的40万眼井中，就有244，000多眼是青年突击队员打的。再如，在最近发起的消灭麻雀、老鼠的运动中，据九个省市的248个县的统计，这些地方的青年少年就已经消灭了1，550多万只。类似这样的事例还很多，因为时间的关系，我不能一一列举。团中央现在正举行团的省市委书记会议，会议已经根据全国农业发展纲要作出了26条规划，我们准备定名为“中国青年为实现1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要的奋斗纲领”。我们相信，只要我们进行切实的组织工作，我们就一定可以把全国农村青年的生产积极性，引向一个新的高潮。
    我要接着谈资产阶级子女在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造中的问题。全国资产阶级的青年子女大约有170万，其中有50万已经参加了国家各个建设部门的工作，有80万在大中学校中学习，有10多万在原来的资本主义企业中服务，有20万因为没有一定的劳动技能或其他原因在家中赋闲，此外，还约有7万多接受了父兄的产业，当了资本家。几年来，他们从活生生的实际生活当中，体验到我们党对他们的关怀，看到祖国一片欣欣向荣的气象。他们中间的大多数人不但能够划清剥削和劳动的界限，努力把自己锻炼成为自食其力的人，而且能够在这次资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮中，积极地帮助自己的父兄接受公私合营。我们也看到，大批年轻的资本家能够积极地去“掌握自己的命运”，站在接受社会主义改造的前头，成了公私合营中的积极分子。我们现在的任务，就是要好好地鼓励那些已经接受公私合营的工商界青年在清产核资、统一安排和搞好生产中继续起带头作用；我们要有计划地帮助他们中间没有劳动技能或者劳动技能不高的人学会和提高建设社会主义的本领；我们还要帮助他们学习马克思列宁主义，用马克思列宁主义来改造和提高自己。对于那些确实已经具备了入团条件的人，我们将按照团章把他们吸收到团里面来。我们相信，只要他们作同样的努力，立志作伟大的社会主义的儿女，他们就一定能够使自己成为建设祖国伟大行列中的大有出息的一员。
    我想着重谈谈我国青年首先是知识青年应该如何向科学文化进军的问题。
    我们的党和毛主席号召我们迅速地赶上世界科学的先进水平，以便迅速地改变我国经济上和科学文化上的落后状况。在我们看来，这不但是对长一辈知识分子的号召，也是对中国的整个年轻一代的伟大号召。如果我们想到现在世界的科学是那样地突飞猛进，我国的科学还掉队得那么远，想到旧中国遗留下来的科学遗产是那样地贫乏，老一辈的科学家的数量又是那么地少，我们就更加感到这个伟大号召对中国青年的严重意义。
    我们的国家现在已经有了280万个高中以上程度的青年知识分子，其中又大约有90万个具有大学和专科以上的程度。这是我国知识界的新一代，是我国高级知识分子直接的后备军。几年以来，广大的青年知识分子积极响应着党和国家的号召，生气勃勃地向苏联学习，向老一辈学习，向科学进军，向文化进军。现在他们中间已经有20万个成了我国优秀的工程技术人员，有7万个成了优秀的农业技术人员，有8万个成了优秀的医务工作人员，有5万个成了优秀的财经贸易干部，有10万个成了优秀的中等学校以上的人民教师，有3万个成了优秀的文学艺术工作者和运动健将，还有10万个在国家其他机关中工作。
    为什么我们这些年轻的知识分子能够成长的这么快呢？如果用一句话来回答，那就是他们能够按照党所指示的唯一正确的道路前进。
    按照党所指示的唯一正确的道路前进，首先就是表现在他们能够把向科学进军的热烈愿望和远大理想同顽强的奋斗精神结合起来。他们能够刻苦用功地学习，并且努力把学来的东西加以消化；他们既能够虚心地向长辈们学习，但是不以前人的成就为满足，而敢于大胆地创造；他们任何时候都不气馁，敢于向前进中的一切困难宣战；他们能够始终如一地贯注党所教给的这样一种信念，那就是只有毫无顾虑毫无留恋地跟着时代前进而前进的人，才是不可战胜的人。
    按照党所指示的唯一正确的道路前进，还表现在他们能够把钻研本行的业务和关心政治正确地配当起来。他们懂得我们的党是要他们成为精通本行业务的各种红色专家，因而他们能够用更多的时间去钻研本行的科学和技术。同时他们又知道，作为一个社会主义的先锋战士，必须关心政治，不关心政治只能够成为自私自利或者眼光短浅的庸人，因而他们能够随时随地关心国家和人民的命运，把个人利益服从于人民的整体利益，能够自觉地高兴地去学习辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，努力去掌握社会发展的规律，努力去通晓我们党的基本政策和同他们业务有关联的政策。正是由于他们能够这样做，他们在工作中就经常感到温暖，感到有一股无穷无尽的力量在指引着自己向前飞奔。
    但是，我们决不是说，所有的知识青年都是这样做了。在他们中间也还有“懒汉”和怕困难的人，幻想着世界上有什么超智慧的飞机，能够坐在这样的飞机上去攀登科学文化的高峰，而用不着自己下苦工夫去钻研。也还有斤斤计较个人得失，因而不能用全心全意为人民服务的精神去对待自己的工作和周围事物的人。我们想着重指出的是还有不少的青年同志，对知识分子老前辈存在着不正确的看法，他们往往只看到许多老前辈的不足的方面，而低估了他们的进步，特别是没有看到许多老前辈在科学技术上的学问和经验是值得自己学习和尊敬的。正是因为我们有些青年同志存在着这种不正确的认识，就使得许多怀着满腔热情想把自己的知识和经验教给年轻一代的老前辈，不能愉快地放手地向这些青年同志传授。我们必须坚决地纠正这种偏向。我们当用一切的努力，使所有的知识青年都懂得，要好好向一切有学问的前辈虚心领教。只有如此，中国青年才能够像党所教导的那样，把祖国的一切有用的知识和宝贵的遗产全部地继承下来。
    向科学文化进军，还要求更多更多的青年能够成为高级知识分子的强大源泉。现在我们党对于扩大高级知识分子的队伍正在采用下面的三个办法：一个办法是要挖掘高等学校的潜力，增加高等学校的学生；再一个办法是要组织已经参加了工作和生产的几百万个中级知识分子，认真地利用业余时间努力进修，使他们在若干年以后能够从中级升到高级；还有一个办法是要在青少年中提早扫除文盲和实行义务教育，以便使他们也能够在若干年以后源源不断地补充到知识分子的队伍中去。这的确是三个好办法。如果我们按照这三个办法去做，就意味着我们向科学进军已经组织好了三支巨大的后梯队。再加上10万个高级知识分子的前梯队，我们就有了四支强大的部队，任何最坚固的科学堡垒，我们都可以经过努力把它拿下来。为了要做到这一点，第一，我们青年团就要加强高等学校和中等专业学校中团的工作，为协助学校行政提高教学质量而努力。在这些学校学习的同学，就要发挥更高的学习积极性，为着把自己培养成为国家有用的人材而刻苦用功。为了要做到这一点，第二，我们就要认真地同教育部门和工会一起，用举办业余大学和组织各种科学小组、召开科学技术会议等等办法去领导青年的业余学习和进修。根据苏联1932年到1937年的统计，那时苏联的新专家有一半左右就是从业余学校中培养出来的。我们现在在工作岗位上的几百万个普通青年知识分子对于利用业余时间进修，可以把自己变成精通本行的红色专家的这一点，也应该具有同样的信心。为了要做到这一点，第三，我们还要认真地同教育部门和妇联抓紧扫盲工作。去年冬天以来，城市和农村参加扫盲学习的人，比前年超过两倍，参加扫盲组织的人，已经有好几百万。但是我们认为还很不够，我们还要使扫盲运动更加蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
    为了向科学文化进军，我们还要大大提倡担任着各种不同工作的干部努力学习本行的科学知识。我们青年团体有这样一条好处，就是各种部门都有，“麻雀虽小，肝胆俱全”。我们认为，只要我们的干部在工作中认真地钻研本行的科学知识，只要我们按照毛主席所指示的那样，更多地懂得马克思列宁主义，更多地懂得自然科学，我们就可以把工作做得更踏实一些，就可以对各种专业知识青年的团结和帮助得更好一些。
    各位委员和各位同志：在这次会议上，我们大家都感到无限的兴奋。因为把我国变成一个经济繁荣、科学发达、文化昌盛的大国，这并不是什么遥远的想望，而是我们这一代完全有把握做成的事业了。我们应该感谢伟大的马克思列宁主义，感谢伟大的中国共产党和毛主席。在这个大好的时光里，我们深信，中国整个年轻的一代一定会发出更大的光和热，朝着我们党和国家所期望的目标，跑步前进。
