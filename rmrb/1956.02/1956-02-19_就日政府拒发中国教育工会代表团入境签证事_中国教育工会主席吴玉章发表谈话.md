Xinhua News Agency, February 17th - Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the Chinese Educational Workers' Trade Union, issued the following statement regarding the fact that the Chinese Educational Workers' Trade Union delegation, invited by the Japan Teachers' Union to visit Japan, was unable to enter the country because the Japanese government refused to issue visas:

　　In recent years, the friendly relations between various people's organizations in China and Japan have been developing day by day, which is entirely in line with the interests and common aspirations of the people of both countries. Educational workers and their trade union organizations in China and Japan have also actively carried out activities conducive to the friendship between the two peoples. In October 1955, after Mr. Takeshi Kobayashi, Chairman of the Japan Teachers' Union, led a study group to visit our country, the Japan Teachers' Union sincerely invited us to participate in the Fifth National Education Research Conference held in Sugiyama City, Japan, on January 30 this year. In order to strengthen the friendly cooperation between educational workers of the two countries, exchange experience in education work, and promote the further development of friendly relations between the two peoples, the Chinese Educational Workers' Trade Union decided to accept the invitation and sent a delegation of four people, including Vice Chairman Fang Ming, who left Beijing for Japan on January 19. However, because the Japanese government has unreasonably refused to issue entry visas, the desire of educational workers of the two countries to meet in Japan has not yet been realized. We express our deep regret for the Japanese government's actions to obstruct friendly exchanges between teachers of the two countries.
　　The Chinese Educational Workers' Trade Union deeply appreciates the friendly invitation of the Japan Teachers' Union and deeply appreciates the efforts made by the Japan Teachers' Union, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution of Japan, and the Japan-China Friendship Association to obtain visas for our delegation. The Chinese Educational Workers' Trade Union will follow the friendly agreement reached by the leaders of the trade unions of China and Japan in Beijing in November 1955 and continue to work to further develop the friendship and cooperation between educational workers of the two countries.

    就日政府拒发中国教育工会代表团入境签证事
    中国教育工会主席吴玉章发表谈话
    新华社17日讯　中国教育工会主席吴玉章就应日本教职员工会邀请访问日本的中国教育工会代表团，因日本政府拒发签证而不能入境事，发表谈话如下：
    近年来中日两国各人民团体之间的友好关系日益发展，这是完全符合于中日两国人民的利益和共同愿望的。中日两国教育工作者和他们的工会组织也积极地进行了有助于两国人民友好的活动。1955年10月间，日本教职员工会主席小林武先生率领考察团来我国访问前后，日本教职员工会曾经诚恳地邀请我们参加今年1月30日在日本杉山市举行的第五届全国教育研究大会。为了加强两国教育工作者的友好合作，交流两国教育工作的经验，促进两国人民友好关系的进一步发展，中国教育工会决定接受邀请并且派出由副主席方明等四人组成的代表团于1月19日离开北京前往日本。但是由于日本政府一直无理地拒绝发给入境签证，以致两国教育工作者在日本会面的愿望至今还未能实现。我们对于日本政府这种阻挠两国教师友好来往的行动，表示非常遗憾。
    中国教育工会深切地感谢日本教职员工会友好的邀请，同时深切地感谢日本教职员工会、日本工会总评议会、日本拥护宪法国民联合会和日中友好协会诸位先生为我们代表团获取签证所作的努力。中国教育工会将遵循1955年11月间由中日两国工会领袖在北京达成的友好协议，为进一步发展中日两国教育工作者的友谊和合作而继续努力。
