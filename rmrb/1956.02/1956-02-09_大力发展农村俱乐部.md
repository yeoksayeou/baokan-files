    Vigorously Develop Rural Clubs

    With the rapid development of the magnificent agricultural cooperation movement, the face of the countryside has undergone fundamental changes. Due to the collectivization of agricultural labor and the change in production relations, due to the growing socialist consciousness among farmers, and due to the urgent need to develop production, the broad masses of farmers are increasingly demanding to improve their cultural level and master new scientific and technical knowledge, demanding richer spiritual lives and the establishment of new lifestyles. Therefore, vigorously carrying out rural cultural work and vigorously developing and consolidating the position of socialist thought in the countryside to meet the needs of the farmers and promote the continued advancement of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production increase movements is the most urgent and important issue for leaders at all levels of cultural work and the highest task for all rural cultural workers.

    The central link in carrying out rural cultural work is to vigorously develop rural clubs based on agricultural production cooperatives. The experience of key pilot projects in various provinces in recent years has proved that rural clubs, as comprehensive mass amateur cultural organizations, have always been valued by rural Party organizations and welcomed by the vast number of members of agricultural production cooperatives because they include a relatively diverse range of cultural activities and are more broadly mass-based, becoming a powerful tool for the Party to conduct propaganda and education among the peasant masses and an important position for promoting socialist thought in the countryside.

    Rural clubs should in principle be established in agricultural production cooperatives, because cultural organizations should be adapted to production organizations. At the same time, the superiority of "organization" brings favorable conditions for the development and improvement of cultural work. Rural clubs should be an important part of agricultural production cooperatives. Its basic task should be to raise the socialist awareness and cultural level of the peasant masses and serve the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production. Its specific tasks are: closely integrating with the central work of the Party and the production work at the time and place, through reading newspapers, listening to the radio, reading books, viewing picture exhibitions, organizing reports and speeches, organizing study, organizing movie watching, singing, performing plays, dancing, and other activities, to publicize and explain the policies and decrees of the Party and the government, organize the masses to study politics and current affairs, assist the government in eliminating illiteracy, disseminate and exchange agricultural production technology, scientific knowledge, and daily health knowledge, and carry out mass amateur cultural and sports activities. The content and form of rural club activities can be more or less, simple or complex, without forcing uniformity. It must be based on the actual local conditions, taking into account the seasonal characteristics of agricultural production and the interests and requirements of different genders and ages among the masses, and it should be continuously developed and improved from the existing foundation of rural cultural work. It should be adapted to the time, place, and people. Rural clubs should absorb the largest number of men, women, old, and young through various activities, so that everyone is happy, and everyone gets what they want. The principles of amateurism and voluntarism should be adhered to. Anything that hinders production and is coercive is wrong.

    The main key to vigorously developing rural clubs lies in leadership. It should be pointed out that not all Party and government departments at all levels have fully valued the important role of rural clubs as a position of socialist thought, and have not clearly recognized that it is a powerful tool for agricultural cooperatives to unite the masses, mobilize the masses to complete various tasks, and conduct self-education and cultural rest. Many leaders have not yet realized that if cultural work cannot closely follow the cooperative movement, and if new socialist cultural life cannot expand its position in the countryside with the development of the cooperative movement, and if the remnants of feudal ideas and capitalist ideas (which do not disappear quickly because their economic foundation is eliminated) are not fought, it will inevitably bring great harm to the socialist transformation of agriculture. Until now, they have not put the important work of developing rural clubs on the agenda, conduct comprehensive planning, and actively lead. Some people even think that mass cultural activities always hinder production, so they adopt a negative attitude towards mass cultural activities and demands, not only not giving support and leadership, but also restricting and even implicitly prohibiting them. These are very harmful, wrong ideas and practices. It should be known that the growing demand of the masses for cultural life is unstoppable. If there are any deviations and shortcomings in the spontaneous cultural and entertainment activities of the masses, it is precisely the result of our abandoning leadership or mistakenly restricting and prohibiting them.

    Another key to vigorously developing rural clubs is to implement the correct policy of running clubs among the masses, and advocate that the cultural undertakings of the masses rely on the masses themselves, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. It is necessary to be good at using and cultivating activists, especially Youth League members and graduates of higher primary schools, and mobilize them to help the broad masses of peasants run the clubs well. The benefits of the club must be fully publicized to enlighten the willingness of the masses. The phenomenon of coercion, commandism, and apportionment of funds should be strictly prevented. Like running cooperatives diligently and frugally, clubs should also be run diligently and frugally, and resolutely oppose extravagance, waste, and the flamboyant style of pursuing form. In places where conditions permit, and under the principle of mass voluntarism and leadership approval, some basic construction needed for cultural activities can be appropriately carried out in certain large cooperatives with developed production, or on a township or village basis.

    In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen business guidance to the clubs so that they can be consolidated and continuously improved. Cultural authorities and county cultural centers and other relevant units should systematically train the activity backbone of the clubs, help solve the difficulties of propaganda and literary and artistic materials, impart new literary and artistic programs, and guide the club's book reading, picture exhibitions, slide shows, and other businesses. Local theater troupes and other artistic groups or professional literary and artistic workers should be organized to carry out planned and focused guidance work on rural clubs. When comprehensively planning guidance work, it must be noted that at appropriate points, such as the area or the place where the key township is located, select clubs with better conditions to cultivate them into central clubs, so that they can gradually play a demonstrative and promoting role for many nearby clubs and conduct guidance work.

    The economic foundation and the entire rural life are undergoing dramatic changes day by day. The socialist transformation of agriculture can be basically completed in about 3 years. It can be imagined that with the development of the situation, the face of rural cultural life will also be completely renewed. Leading comrades of competent authorities at all levels and all rural cultural workers should be full of confidence and strive to proactively grasp the laws of the development of the objective situation and vigorously carry out rural cultural work to help promote the progress of the socialist revolution in the vast rural areas of the country.

    大力发展农村俱乐部
    随着波澜壮阔的农业合作化运动的急剧发展，农村的面貌已经发生了根本的变化。由于农业劳动的集体化和生产关系的改变，由于农民中的社会主义意识日益发展，由于发展生产的迫切需要，广大农民群众日益要求提高文化水平和掌握新的科学技术知识，要求有更丰富的精神生活和建立新的生活方式。因此，大力开展农村文化工作，大力发展和巩固社会主义思想在农村中的阵地，来满足农民的需要并且推动农业合作化和农业增产运动的继续前进，这是文化工作的各级领导者当前的一个最迫切的重大问题，也是全体农村文化工作者的最高的任务。
    开展农村文化工作的中心环节，是大力发展以农业生产合作社为基础的农村俱乐部。各省近年来重点试办的经验证明：农村俱乐部这种综合性的群众业余文化组织，由于它本身包括了比较多样的文化活动形式，活动更带有广泛的群众性，一直受到农村党组织的重视和农业生产合作社广大社员的欢迎，成为党向农民群众进行宣传教育的有力工具，成为在农村宣传社会主义思想的重要阵地。
    农村俱乐部原则上应该在农业生产合作社里建立，因为文化组织应该同生产组织相适应，同时，“组织起来”的优越性，给文化工作带来了发展和提高的有利条件。农村俱乐部应该是农业生产合作社的一个重要组成部分。它的基本任务应该是：提高农民群众的社会主义觉悟和文化水平，为农业的社会主义改造和发展农业生产服务。它的具体任务就是：密切结合党的中心工作和当时当地的生产工作，通过读报、收听广播、图书阅览、图片展览、组织报告演讲、组织学习、组织看电影、唱歌、演戏、跳舞等等活动，来宣传解释党和政府的政策、法令，组织群众学习政治、时事，协助政府扫除文盲，传播和交流农业生产技术、科学知识和日常卫生知识，开展群众业余文艺、体育活动。农村俱乐部的活动内容和形式可多可少，可简可繁，不要强求一律，必须根据当地的实际情况，照顾到农业生产的季节性特点和群众中不同性别、不同年龄的兴趣和要求，并且要从农村文化工作现有的基础出发，不断地加以发展和提高。应该因时制宜，因地制宜，因人制宜。农村俱乐部应该通过各种各样的活动，吸收最大多数的男女老少参加，做到皆大欢喜，各得其所，“大家闹，大家看”。应该坚持业余、自愿的原则。凡是妨害生产和强迫命令，都是错误的。
    大力发展农村俱乐部的主要关键，在于领导。应该指出：现在并不是所有的各级党、政主管部门都已经充分地重视作为社会主义思想阵地的农村俱乐部的重要作用，明确地认识到它是农业社团结群众、动员群众完成各项任务的有力工具和进行自我教育、文化休息的中心场所。还有不少的领导人还没有认识到：如果文化工作不能紧紧跟上合作化运动，不能使社会主义的新的文化生活随着合作化运动的发展而扩展自己在农村中的阵地，如果不对封建残余思想和资本主义思想（它们并不因它们的经济基础的消灭而很快消灭）进行斗争，那就必然会给农业的社会主义改造事业带来极大的损害。他们直到现在还没有把发展农村俱乐部这项重要的工作提到工作日程上来，进行全面规划，积极领导。甚至有的人认为群众搞文化活动总归是妨害生产的，因而对群众的文化活动和要求，采取了消极的态度，非但不给予支持和领导，而且加以限制，甚至变相地禁止。这些都是非常有害的、错误的想法和做法。要知道群众对于文化生活的日益增涨的要求是不可遏止的，如果在群众自发的文化娱乐活动中间有什么偏差和缺点，那正是我们放弃了领导或者错误地加以限制和禁止的结果。
    大力发展农村俱乐部的另一个关键，还在于要把办俱乐部的正确方针，贯彻到群众中去，提倡群众的文化事业依靠群众自己来办，发挥群众的积极性和创造性。必须善于运用和培养积极分子，特别是青年团员、高小毕业生，动员他们来帮助广大的农民群众办好俱乐部。要充分地宣传俱乐部的好处，启发群众的自愿，应该严格防止强迫命令、摊派经费的现象。同勤俭办社一样，也应当勤俭地办俱乐部，坚决反对铺张浪费，追求形式的浮夸作风。在有条件的地方，在群众自愿和领导批准的原则下，可以在某些生产发展的大社里面，或者以全乡、全村为单位，适当举办文化活动所需要的一些基本建设。
    此外，还必须加强对俱乐部的业务辅导，才能使它巩固和不断地提高。文化主管部门和县文化馆等有关单位应该有计划地训练俱乐部的活动骨干，帮助解决宣传和文娱材料的困难，传授新的文艺节目，指导俱乐部的图书阅览、图片展览、幻灯工作等业务。应该组织当地的剧团和其他艺术团体或专业文艺工作者有计划地、有重点地进行对农村俱乐部的辅导工作。在全面规划辅导工作的时候，必须注意在适当地点，例如区或者重点乡所在的地方，选择条件比较好的俱乐部培养成中心俱乐部，使它逐步能够对附近的许多俱乐部起示范推动的作用和进行辅导工作。
    农村的经济基础和整个的农村生活正在日新月异地剧变中，大约3年左右的时间，农业的社会主义改造就可以基本上完成。可以设想，随着形势的发展，农村文化生活的面貌也必将焕然一新。各级主管部门的领导同志和全体农村文化工作者应该满怀信心地为主动地掌握客观形势发展的规律、大力开展农村文化工作、来帮助推动全国广大农村中社会主义革命的进展而奋斗。
