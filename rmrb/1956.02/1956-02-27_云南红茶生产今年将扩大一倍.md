Yunnan Black Tea Production to Double This Year

    The Yunnan Provincial Tea Company and relevant departments have made preliminary plans for developing black tea production throughout the province. Starting this year, Fengqing County, the original black tea producing area, will be the focus, while expanding black tea production in Lincang, Yunxian, Changning, Xishuangbanna and other places. It is estimated that this year's black tea production will double compared to last year.

    Currently, relevant parties have already begun preparing to add 64 primary black tea processing stations and one refined processing factory. At the same time, more than 200 technicians have been transferred, ready to be dispatched to various black tea producing areas to be responsible for technical instruction and guidance. The Yunnan Provincial Agricultural Bank also plans to issue a batch of loans to help tea farmers build primary black tea processing houses and purchase equipment.

    云南红茶生产今年将扩大一倍
    云南省茶业公司和有关部门对发展全省红茶生产作出了初步计划。从今年起，将以原来产红茶的凤庆县为重点，同时在临沧、云县、昌宁、西双版纳等地扩大红茶生产。预计今年红茶产量，将比去年增加一倍。
    目前，有关方面已经着手准备增设红茶初制所64个，精制加工厂一个；同时，抽调了200多名技术员，准备分派到各红茶产区负责技术传授和指导工作。云南省农业银行也计划发放一批贷款，帮助茶农修建初制红茶房舍和添置设备。（云南日报编辑部）
