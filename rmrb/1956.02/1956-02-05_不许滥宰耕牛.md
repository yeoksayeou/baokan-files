    No Indiscriminate Slaughter of Draught Cattle Allowed
    To the Editor:
    The Liaoning Wulong Gold Mine, directly under the Nonferrous Metals Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, has been continuously slaughtering draught cattle since July 1955. In the 40 days from mid-November to December 28, 1955 alone, this mine slaughtered 26 head of draught cattle, many of which were cows and young cattle.
    Mine director Yang Jianyuan should bear a great responsibility for the mine's mistake of slaughtering large numbers of draught cattle. He once appealed to everyone at a staff meeting: Now that cattle are so cheap, why not buy them and slaughter them for food? He himself took the lead in slaughtering three draught cattle. As a result, the mine's catering department and the families of employees also followed suit and bought cattle for slaughter.
    Draught cattle are one of the main sources of power for agricultural production at present. On December 30, 1955, the State Council issued instructions on preventing the indiscriminate slaughter of draught cattle and protecting and developing draught cattle. Mine director Yang Jianyuan's behavior of advocating the slaughter of draught cattle for petty gains is intolerable, and the higher authorities should seriously deal with this matter.

### 不许滥宰耕牛

    不许滥宰耕牛
    编辑同志：
    重工业部有色金属管理局直属辽宁五龙金矿从1955年7月以来不断宰杀耕牛。仅在1955年11月中旬到12月28日的40天中，这个矿就宰了耕牛26头，其中有不少还是母牛和幼牛。
    对于这个矿大量宰杀耕牛的错误，矿长杨见远应该负很大责任。他曾在职工大会上向大家号召：现在牛这样贱，为什么不去买牛来杀了吃呢？他本人就带头杀了三头耕牛。于是，矿上的伙食部门和职工家属也跟着买牛来宰杀。
    耕牛是目前农业生产上的主要动力之一。1955年12月30日国务院就发布了关于防止滥宰耕牛和保护发展耕牛的指示。五龙金矿矿长杨见远为了贪图小利提倡宰杀耕牛的行为令人难以容忍，上级领导机关应该对这件事作严肃的处理。
