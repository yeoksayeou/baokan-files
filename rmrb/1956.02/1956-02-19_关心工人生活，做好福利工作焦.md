Show concern for workers' lives, do a good job in welfare work

    The Jiaozuo Machinery Factory should eliminate worker poisoning accidents

    To the Editor:
    The leadership of the Henan Provincial State-owned Jiaozuo Machinery Factory does not pay enough attention to safe production. The copper smelting furnace in this factory lacks safety equipment and constantly emits greenish-yellow poisonous fumes, resulting in frequent worker poisoning accidents. After being poisoned, workers experience chills and fevers similar to malaria, severely affecting production. When the poisoning accidents first occurred, the factory director and the chairman of the trade union were busy consoling the poisoned workers, but they did not take effective measures to prevent the accidents. At the factory's general meeting of Party members, everyone unanimously requested the administrative side to install safety equipment, but the administrative leadership has been slow to resolve this issue.
    Later, after urging from various parties, the administrative leadership did take some measures, but they could not fundamentally solve the problem. The factory installed a dust collector on the copper furnace, but because the dust collector could not completely cover the copper furnace, it did not function as intended. Later, the factory adopted the method of soaking masks in sodium carbonate solution, but this method was only effective for 20 minutes, requiring frequent mask changes, and the effect was poor. Later, with the efforts of the medical staff, the factory also adopted methods such as drinking red tea to detoxify the workers; but this was only a passive solution, and poisoning continued to occur. Once, after workers Han Tingmao, Qin Zhengkui, Chen Kaikun and others were poisoned, their body temperatures rose to over 40 degrees Celsius, and they felt dizzy. They planned to ask for leave, but thinking that taking leave would affect the state plan, they drank some tea and went back to work. The workers' enthusiasm for labor is commendable; but their demand that the administrative leadership show concern for their safety is entirely justified.
    Currently, the factory's administrative leadership has taken the following approach: to improve air circulation, they built a copper furnace shed with three sides open. Working in this environment is acceptable in the summer; but in the winter, workers will be severely damaging their health if they have to work in the shed in the severe cold.
    In fact, the problem of worker poisoning at the Jiaozuo Machinery Factory can be solved. The solution is to improve the ventilation in the copper smelting furnace workshop. The administrative leadership of this factory should strengthen their concern for the safety of workers in production, and the trade union cadres should also pay attention to urging the administrative side to improve working conditions. Only in this way can poisoning accidents be prevented.

    The worker dormitory problem of the Tianjin Second Food Processing Factory must be reasonably resolved

    To the Editor:
    The Tianjin Meat and Egg Products Processing and Supply Station Second Food Processing Factory of the China Food Company is one of the large-scale food processing enterprises in the country. The factory buildings were newly built in 1953 and are located in Zhangguizhuang, in the southeast suburbs of Tianjin, about 30 miles from the city center. However, there are very few dormitories near the factory site, and most of the workers live in the original factory in Xiyuzhuang, more than 40 miles from Zhangguizhuang. They have to travel back and forth every day to get to and from work, which wastes a lot of time and money on transportation. To solve this problem, the factory repeatedly applied to the Tianjin Third Commercial Bureau for the construction of 2,000 square meters of dormitories, but the Third Commercial Bureau did not approve it at the time because it wanted to "save investment." Therefore, the factory had to let the workers take the train to work in the morning and send them back to the dormitories in rented transportation company cars in the evening. In this way, the factory's expenses for train fares and car rentals alone amounted to 120,000 yuan in 1955. If the cost of building a dormitory is calculated at 40 yuan per square meter, 3,000 square meters of dormitories could be built.
    Because the accommodation is too far from the factory, the workers face many difficulties. Take the workers living in Xiyuzhuang, for example, they spend about 3 hours every day walking, waiting for the bus, and taking the bus. As a result, some workers can only sleep five or six hours a day besides production time and commuting time, which is very tiring. Under these circumstances, production will inevitably suffer.
    It is hoped that the relevant leadership departments of the Tianjin Second Food Processing Factory will seriously and comprehensively calculate this account. In order to protect the health of the workers and improve production, don't only see the "savings" in basic construction investment, but not see the huge transportation expenses; don't only pay attention to "increasing production and practicing economy," but not see the safety, health, and indispensable welfare of the workers!

    关心工人生活，做好福利工作焦
    作机械厂应该杜绝工人中毒事故编辑同志：
    河南省地方国营焦作机械厂领导方面对安全生产很不重视。这个工厂的铸铜炉上没有安全设备，不断冒着黄绿色的毒烟，因而经常发生工人中毒事故。工人们中毒以后，就忽冷忽热像害疟疾病一样，严重地影响了生产。开始发生中毒事故的时候，厂长和工会主席虽然忙着慰问中毒工人，但是并没有采取有效的措施来防止事故。在全厂党员大会上，大家一致要求行政上装置安全设备，行政领导方面仍然迟迟不解决这个问题。
    后来，经过各方面的督促，行政领导方面虽然采取了一些办法，但是不能根本解决问题。厂方是在铜炉上安装了一个吸尘器；因为吸尘器不能把铜炉盖严，起不了应有的作用。以后，厂方又采用用碳酸钠药水浸口罩的办法；但是这种做法的有效防毒时间只有20分钟，口罩需要经常更换，而且效果也很差。后来在医务人员的努力下，厂方也采用过喝红茶等办法来给工人解毒；但是这仅仅是消极的办法，中毒现象仍然不断发生。有一次，工人韩廷茂、秦正魁、陈开坤等人中毒以后，体温上升到40多度，头脑发昏。他们打算去请假，但是一想到请假要影响国家计划，他们喝了一些茶叶水，又上工了。工人们的劳动热情是可贵的；但是他们要求行政领导方面关心他们的安全，这个要求是完全正当的。
    目前，工厂行政领导方面采取的办法是这样的：为了使空气流通，盖了一个三面没有墙的铜炉棚。在这种环境里工作，夏天是可以的；但是一到冬天，工人们再要在工棚里冒着严寒工作，就会严重地损害身体健康。
    实际上，焦作机械厂的工人中毒问题是可以得到解决的。办法就是做好铸铜炉车间的通风工作。这个工厂的行政领导应该加强对职工安全生产的关怀，工会干部也应该注意督促行政方面改善劳动条件。只要这样，中毒事故就可以得到防止。

    天津第二食品加工厂职工宿舍问题要合理解决编辑同志：
    中国食品公司天津肉类蛋品加工供应站第二食品加工厂是国内大型食品加工企业之一。这个厂的厂房是1953年新建的，位于天津东南郊区张贵庄，离市区大约有30多里。但是，厂址附近的宿舍却很少，大部分职工都住在离张贵庄40多里的西于庄原来的厂子里，每天上班下班，往返跋涉，多费了时间，也多花了车费。为了解决这个问题，厂里曾经一再向天津市第三商业局申请修建2，000平方公尺的宿舍，但是第三商业局当时因为要“节省投资”，没有给以批准。于是，厂方只好让工人早晨乘火车上班，晚间乘厂里租用运输公司的汽车送回宿舍。这样，厂方负担的火车费和汽车租金两项开支，1955年一年就花去了12万元。如果以宿舍每平方公尺造价40元计算，可修建3，000平方公尺的宿舍。
    由于住宿地点离工厂太远，职工遭遇的困难也很多。拿住在西于庄的工人来说，每天花在走路、等车和乘车的时间要3小时左右。因此有的职工每天除了生产时间和上下班时间以外，只能睡五、六个小时的觉，非常劳累。在这种情况下，生产当然也会受到损失。
    希望天津市第二食品加工厂的有关领导部门认真地、全面地算算这笔账。为了保护职工身体的健康，搞好生产，不要只看到“节省”了基本建设投资的一方面，而看不到庞大的交通费用的支出；不要只注意了“增产节约”，而看不到职工的安全、健康和必不可少的福利事业！
