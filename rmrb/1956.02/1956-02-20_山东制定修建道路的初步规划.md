Shandong Province, based on the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Outline (Draft), has formulated a preliminary plan for the construction and improvement of county and township roads throughout the province. The plan requires that within the seven years from 1956 to 1962, the province will build 41,800 kilometers of simple highways, 50,000 kilometers of cart tracks, and improve 4,500 kilometers of dirt roads. More than 35 million trees will also be planted along both sides of the roads.

The plan requires all parts of the province to immediately establish dedicated management agencies at all levels, formulate comprehensive plans for the construction and improvement of roads in each special zone, county, and township; and to seize the opportunity of the agricultural off-season to fully mobilize the power of the masses to complete the plan.

After the implementation of this plan, the road network of Shandong Province can be basically completed. At that time, even in mountainous areas, cars and tractors will be able to pass between counties and districts, and between districts and agricultural production cooperatives that can use mechanized farming.

    山东制定修建道路的初步规划
    山东省根据全国农业发展纲要（草案）的精神，制定了全省修建和改善县、乡道路的初步规划。规划要求，在1956年到1962年的7年内，全省将修建简易公路41，800公里，修建大车道50，000公里，改善土路4，500公里。道路两旁还要植树3，500多万株。
    规划要求全省各地立即建立各级专管机构，订出各专区、县、乡的修建和改善道路的全面规划；并且要抓紧农闲季节，充分发挥群众的力量去完成规划。
    这一规划实现以后，山东全省的道路网可以基本上建成。那时候，即使在山区，县和区、区和能用机械耕作的农业生产合作社之间，也将通行汽车和拖拉机。（本报驻济南记者）
