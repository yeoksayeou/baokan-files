Organize Advanced Experience Exchange Groups to Perform Demonstrations
In order to improve the quality of cotton textile products and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of young textile workers in completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League selected 11 outstanding young production experts from 9 textile factories across the province to form a textile industry youth advanced experience exchange group to conduct demonstration technical performances in various textile factories in Shaanxi Province.

From January 20th to 29th, the youth advanced experience exchange group had already conducted more than 20 performances in 9 textile factories in Shaanxi Province, receiving warm welcomes and widespread praise from the factory workers. Wang Shizhen, a weaving worker at the Northwest Second State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory who hadn't produced a single piece of substandard cloth in seven or eight months, could watch 24 looms, had shorter patrol times than those in other factories, and meticulously inspected the cloth surface and warp beams. Her experience attracted everyone who visited. Wherever she went, visitors followed. After each performance, visitors would ask questions until they learned the techniques. Zhang Chunxiu, a national youth socialist construction activist, had her automatic twisting and knotting method be most popular among young fine yarn weaving workers in the State-Owned Cotton Factories No. 1 and No. 2 and Shaanxi Cotton Factory No. 1. They all expressed their intention to learn Zhang Chunxiu's knotting method and change their own twisting and pulling knotting method. Ma Guifang and Liu Ming, young workers in the finishing department of the C shift at the Xi'an Textile Factory, learned on the spot from Wang Fengyun, a cloth repair worker at the State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 3, the experience of changing weft yarn scraping to warp yarn scraping to ensure product quality. After the youth advanced experience exchange group performed in each factory, the factories organized young workers to hold discussions. At the discussions, the young workers expressed one after another: they would strive to learn the operational characteristics of the performers, improve their own operating methods, further improve product quality, and better complete the national plan. Technicians and staff also said: they would take the performers' operational characteristics as a technical measure to complete tasks in the future and promote it in the workshop. The cloth weaving workshop of the State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 2 also plans to include the performers' advanced operating methods into the February measure plan to ensure implementation.

    组织先进经验交流组做示范表演
    为了提高棉纺织产品质量，充分发挥青年纺织工人在提前完成五年计划中的积极作用，青年团陕西省委在全省9个纺织厂中，选拔了11名不同工种的优秀青年生产能手，组成纺织业青年先进经验交流组，到陕西省各纺织厂作示范性技术表演。
    青年先进经验交流组，从1月20日至29日，已经在陕西省9个纺织厂进行了20多次表演，受到各厂职工的热烈欢迎和普遍赞扬。国营西北第二棉纺织厂布场七、八个月没出一匹次布的值车工王世珍，能看24台布机，巡回时间比各厂的都短，检查布面、经轴也很详细。她的这些经验吸引着每个参观的人。她走到哪里参观的人就跟到哪里。每次表演后，参观者还要问这问那，直到学会为止。全国青年社会主义建设积极分子张春秀的自动加捻接头法在国棉一、二厂和陕棉一厂的青年细纱值车工中最受欢迎。他们都表示要学习张春秀的接头方法，改变自己的捻拉接头法。西安纺织厂丙班整理部青年工人马桂芳、刘明当场就学会了国棉三厂修布工王凤云的改刮纬纱为刮经纱以保证产品质量的经验。青年先进经验交流小组在每一个厂表演以后，各厂都组织青年工人进行座谈。青年工人们在座谈会上纷纷表示：要努力学习表演者的操作特点，改进自己的操作方法，进一步提高产品质量，更好地完成国家计划。技术人员和职员们也表示：要把表演者的操作特点作为今后完成任务的一项技术措施，在车间里推广。国棉二厂布场车间还计划把表演者的先进操作方法，订入2月份措施计划中去，保证贯彻执行。
