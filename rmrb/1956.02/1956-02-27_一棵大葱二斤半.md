A Scallion Weighing Two and a Half Jin

At the agricultural advanced producers' symposium held by the Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry from the 18th to the 22nd, farmer Song Guodong brought 6 large scallions with the thickness of a large teacup.

At this meeting, advanced producers from various regions exchanged experiences in high-yield production of various crops. Song Guodong is a member of the Luojiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Yinchuan City. Last year, he used the method of cutting off part of the root hairs of the seed scallion to cultivate seeds. The two mu of scallions planted with this kind of seed yielded more than 8,000 jin per mu, with an average of nearly one jin per scallion. The heaviest weighed two to two and a half jin.

When reporting on high-yield achievements, agricultural advanced producers particularly emphasized that they broke through conservative thinking and demonstrated a pioneering spirit.

    一棵大葱二斤半
    甘肃省农林厅在18日到22日召开的农业先进生产者座谈会上，农民宋国栋带来了有大茶杯口粗的6根大葱。
    在这个会上，各地先进生产者交流了各类农作物高额丰产经验。宋国栋是银川市郊区罗家庄农业生产合作社的社员。去年他用割去籽葱根部一部分根毛的办法来培育种子。用这种种子种植的两亩大葱，每亩产8，000多斤，平均每根葱将近有一斤重。其中最重的有两斤到两斤半。
    农业先进生产者在报告高额丰产事迹的时候，特别强调了他们打破了保守思想和首创的精神。
