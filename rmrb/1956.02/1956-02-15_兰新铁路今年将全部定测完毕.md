Railway surveying personnel in the Northwest proposed to survey more than 1,100 kilometers of railway lines this year than planned. In this way, the detailed survey work of the Lanxin Railway, which was originally scheduled to be completed next year, can be completed ahead of schedule by the end of this year.

Railway surveying personnel have put forward many methods for completing the survey plan ahead of schedule or exceeding the quota. Before starting work, the surveying personnel of the Lanxin Railway first determine the route direction and limiting gradient principles. In this way, surveying only a 600-kilometer line can replace the originally planned comparison line of more than 1,300 kilometers. Railway surveying personnel are also preparing to promote advanced experience such as double-sided stadia rod measurement and electrical prospecting methods. The parallel cross-surveying method advocated by surveying personnel Liu Tieyan will also be widely promoted. (Xinhua News Agency)

    兰新铁路今年将全部定测完毕
    西北铁路勘测人员提出今年要比计划多勘测1，100多公里的铁路线。这样，原来要明年才能全部完成的兰新铁路定测工作，在今年年底就可以提前完成。
    铁路勘测人员提出许多提前或超额完成勘测计划的办法。兰新铁路的勘测人员在出发工作之前，先把线路方向和限制坡度等原则确定好，这样只要勘测600公里的一条线路，就可以代替原来计划的1，300多公里的比较线。铁路勘测人员还准备推行双面塔尺测量法、电探法等先进经验，勘测人员刘铁岩倡议的平行交叉勘测法，也将普遍推广。　（新华社）
