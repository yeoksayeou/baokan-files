    The Kunming Machine Tool Plant had long been planning to implement a piece-rate wage system, but was always afraid that the "conditions" were not sufficient and delayed implementation; they were especially worried about compressing work quotas, fearing that it would lead to failure to complete tasks. However, the results of the implementation refuted these concerns and excuses. In November of last year, the plant's foundry workers' work quotas were reduced by an average of about 30%, but the workers completed an average of 5% above their targets, and wages increased by an average of 9.5%. For the boring and milling machine saddle, the original quota was 15 hours per piece, and the production department requested a change to 12 hours per piece. The construction department added special tools for this purpose, and after calculating, they still thought it would be difficult to achieve this requirement. However, after the implementation of the piece-rate wage system, the workers improved the angle of the tool and the operating method, and completed it in 7 hours.
    The practice of the Kunming Machine Tool Plant once again proves that the implementation of piece-rate wages can most correctly combine the individual interests of workers with the interests of the entire socialist production, and can most effectively promote the increase of labor productivity. However, some people now find it "troublesome" to implement piece-rate wages, saying that the wage issue is like a "hornet's nest" that cannot be touched; some people even slander those who demand the implementation of piece-rate wages as "economists." This is a right-leaning conservative tendency manifested in labor and wage issues, and we should resolutely oppose it.

    计件工资的效果
    昆明机床厂老早就酝酿着推行计件工资制，可是总怕“条件”不够，迟迟不推行；尤其对压缩工时定额顾虑更大，怕因此完不成任务。但是实行的结果否定了这些顾虑和借口。去年11月份，这个厂的铸工工时定额平均压缩了30％左右，工人却平均超额5％完成了任务，工资平均增长了9.5％。搪立铣床鞍，原来定额为15小时一件，生产科要求改为12小时一件，施工科为此专门增加了专门工具，算来算去还认为很难达到这个要求。但是，实行计件工资以后，工人改进了刀子角度和操作方法，7小时就完成了。
    昆明机床厂的实践再一次证明：实行计件工资，就可以最正确地把工作者的个人利益同整个社会主义生产的利益结合起来，就可以最有效地促进劳动生产率的提高。但是现在有些人嫌推行计件工资“麻烦”，说工资问题就像个“马蜂窝”，动不得；有的人甚至污蔑要求推行计件工资的人为“经济主义”。这是一种表现在劳动工资问题上的右倾保守倾向，我们应当坚决反对。
