Regulations of the State Council on Implementing the Fixed Interest Rate Method in Joint State-Private Enterprises
(Adopted at the 24th Plenary Meeting of the State Council on February 8, 1956)

In order to adapt to the new situation of the implementation of full industry-wide joint state-private ownership of private enterprises and to further carry out the needs of socialist transformation, it is necessary and appropriate to implement the fixed interest rate method for private shares in joint state-private enterprises. The main issues of implementing the fixed interest rate method are now stipulated as follows:

I. Fixed interest means that during the period of joint state-private ownership, the enterprise, regardless of profit or loss, pays dividends to private shareholders quarterly based on the interest rate.

II. The fixed interest rate for private shares in joint state-private enterprises nationwide is stipulated to be between 1% and 6% per annum.

III. Based on the needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood and the specific circumstances of each industry and enterprise, different interest rates can be set between regions and industries within the range of interest rates stipulated in the preceding article, or the same interest rate can be set. The same interest rate can be set within the same industry in the same region. If it is indeed necessary, several different interest rates can also be set.

If the relevant departments of the State Council believe that there is a need and conditions to stipulate a nationally unified interest rate for certain industries, they may, after consultation between the public and private parties, submit a plan to the State Council for review and decision.

IV. The work of fixing interest rates for joint state-private enterprises in provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should be carried out under the unified leadership of the People's Committees of the respective provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. When joint state-private enterprises implement fixed interest rates, the public and private parties should, under the leadership of the local competent authorities and administrative departments for industry and commerce, conduct consultations by industry, put forward opinions on fixing interest rates for the industry, and report them to the People's Committees of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government for review and submission to the relevant departments of the State Council for examination and decision.

V. If an individual joint state-private enterprise has special circumstances and the interest rate needs to be higher than 6%, the People's Committee of the province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government shall review and report it to the State Council for approval.

VI. Joint state-private enterprises that do not implement fixed interest rates for the time being may distribute dividends in accordance with the principle of surplus distribution stipulated in the "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises" issued by the Government Administration Council in September 1954, or in accordance with customary practices.

    国务院关于在公私合营企业中推行定息办法的规定
    （1956年2月8日国务院全体会议第二十四次会议通过）
    为了适应私营企业实行全行业公私合营的新情况和进一步进行社会主义改造的需要，对公私合营企业的私股推行定息办法，是必要的和适当的。现在把推行定息的办法的几个主要问题作如下的规定：
    一、定息，就是企业在公私合营时期，不论盈亏，依据息率，按季付给私股股东以股息。
    二、对全国公私合营企业私股实行定息的息率，规定为年息1厘到6厘。
    三、根据国计民生的需要和各行业、企业的具体情况，在前条规定的息率幅度内，地区之间、行业之间，可以定出不同的息率，也可以定出同一的息率。同一地区的行业内部可以定出同一的息率，如果确有必要，也可以定出几个不同的息率。
    国务院业务主管部门认为对某些行业有规定全国统一的息率的需要和条件的时候，经过公私双方协商，可以提出方案报请国务院审核决定。
    四、省、自治区、直辖市的公私合营企业定息的工作，应该分别在省、自治区、直辖市的人民委员会的统一领导下进行。公私合营企业实行定息的时候，应该由公私双方在当地业务主管机关、工商行政机关的领导下，按行业进行协商，提出对本行业定息的意见，报请省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会核报国务院主管部门审核决定。
    五、个别公私合营企业，如果情况特殊，息率需要高于6厘的，由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会核报国务院批准。
    六、暂不实行定息的公私合营企业，可以按照1954年9月政务院“公私合营工业企业暂行条例”所规定的盈余分配原则或者按照惯例分配股息。
