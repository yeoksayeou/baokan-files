The friendly match between the Yugoslav Youth Football Team and the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" Football Team began at 2:40 PM on the 2nd. In less than a minute, Doporak, the right inside forward of the Yugoslav team, scored the first goal from the left front of the "August 1st" team's goal. Their rapid action drew enthusiastic applause from the audience. The "August 1st" team then launched a counterattack. In the third minute, the "August 1st" team had two opportunities to take "corner kicks," but they were unable to score due to the tight defense of the Yugoslav defenders. In the 36th minute, Antic, the center forward of the Yugoslav team, scored another goal with a long shot from more than 20 meters in front of the "August 1st" team's goal. After that, the Yugoslav team's attack became more and more frequent. Their players passed the ball quickly and accurately, ran fast, and were skilled in dribbling and passing opponents. In the 38th minute, the backheel pass technique used by Vesselinović, the left inside forward, and the back-to-goal bicycle kick technique used by Doporak, the right inside forward, once again won enthusiastic applause from the audience. In the 44th minute of the match, Birlinćević, the left forward of the Yugoslav team, scored the third goal. The Yugoslav team led by three to zero in the first half.

In the 6th minute of the second half, the Yugoslav team had a chance to take a "corner kick." Vesselinović, the left inside forward, quickly passed the ball to Antic, the center forward, after receiving the ball in front of the "August 1st" team's goal, and Antic scored with one shot. After conceding the goal, the "August 1st" team worked hard to counterattack. In the 25th minute, they attacked the Yugoslav team's penalty area. Chen Keliang, the left inside forward, passed the ball to Jin Shizhong, the center forward, in front of the Yugoslav team's goal. Jin shot hard, but the ball was saved by Beala, the Yugoslav team's goalkeeper, and fell to the ground. Xian Dixiong, the right inside forward of the "August 1st" team, immediately caught up and scored, making the score four to one. Later, the Yugoslav team launched a series of attacks. In the 35th and 40th minutes, Antic, the center forward, and Vesselinović, the left inside forward, scored two more goals. The Yugoslav Youth Football Team won the entire match with a score of six to one. (According to Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    南斯拉夫青年足球队同中国人民解放军“八一”足球队的友谊比赛在2日下午2点40分开始。不到一分钟，南斯拉夫队右内锋多泼拉克就从“八一”队球门左前方射入第一球。他们这种迅速的动作，引起了全场观众的热烈掌声。“八一”队接着展开反攻。在第三分钟的时候，“八一”队曾经获得两次发“角球”的机会，但是在南斯拉夫后卫的严密防守下，都没有能够取得射门的机会。在第36分钟的时候，南斯拉夫队中锋安蒂契在离“八一”队球门前20多公尺处远射，又中一球。以后，南斯拉夫队的进攻越来越频繁了，他们的队员传球又快又准，跑得也快，盘球和过人的技术都很熟练。在第38分钟的时候，左内锋维塞利诺维契运用的以脚跟传球的技术和右内锋多泼拉克运用的背向球门用脚倒钩射门的技术，再一次博得了观众的热烈掌声。在比赛进行到第44分钟的时候，南斯拉夫队左前锋比尔林切维契射入了第三个球。上半场比赛南斯拉夫队以三比零领先。
    下半场比赛开始以后的第6分钟，南斯拉夫队获得发“角球”的机会。左内锋维塞利诺维契在“八一”队球门前得球以后迅速传给中锋安蒂契，安蒂契一脚射中。“八一”队失球以后努力反攻，在第25分钟的时候，攻入南斯拉夫队禁区，左内锋陈克亮把球传给在南斯拉夫队球门前的中锋金士钟，金猛力射门，球被南斯拉夫队守门员倍阿拉扑出落地，“八一”队右内锋冼迪雄马上赶上一脚射入，纪录成为四比一。以后，南斯拉夫队又连续展开进攻，在第35分钟和第40分钟的时候，中锋安蒂契和左内锋维塞利诺维契又射入两个球。全场比赛南斯拉夫青年足球队以六比一获胜。　（据新华社讯）（附图片）
