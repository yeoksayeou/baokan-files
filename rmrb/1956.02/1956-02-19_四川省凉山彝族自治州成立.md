The Greater and Lesser Liangshan areas, where the Yi people of China reside in concentrated communities, have officially merged to form the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province. The First Session of the Third People's Representative Conference of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province (formerly the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Xikang Province), held in Zhaojue from February 2nd to 9th, elected the new People's Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture. Wazhamuji (Yi) was elected as the governor, and Wang Haimin (Yi) and six others were elected as deputy governors. Representatives from the Lesser Liangshan and Yuexi areas, newly incorporated into the Autonomous Prefecture, attended the meeting.

The conference also focused on discussing the issue of implementing democratic reforms in Liangshan. The conference believed that due to the correct implementation of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies in recent years, the unity among the various ethnic groups in Liangshan and within the Yi ethnic group has been unprecedentedly strengthened, and significant achievements have been made in political, economic, and cultural construction. In order to further develop social productive forces and improve the people's lives, democratic reforms should be implemented in a moderate manner. The conference adopted the "Implementation Measures for Democratic Reform in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province" and some resolutions related to democratic reform.

After the expansion, the administrative region of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture includes 11 counties: Zhaojue, Meigu, Xide, Puge, Puxiong, Butuo, Jinyang, Yuexi, Leibo, Mabian, and Ebian, covering an area of approximately 35,000 square kilometers. The prefecture has a population of approximately 970,000 people from the Yi, Han, Miao, and other ethnic groups, with the Yi ethnic group numbering nearly 800,000.

    四川省凉山彝族自治州成立
    中国彝族聚居的大、小凉山地区正式合并，成立了四川省凉山彝族自治州。2日到9日在昭觉举行的四川省凉山彝族自治州（原西康省凉山彝族自治州）第三届人民代表会议第一次会议，选举了新的自治州人民委员会，瓦渣木基（彝）当选为州长，王海民（彝）等7人当选为副州长。新并入自治州的小凉山和越嶲地区代表都出席了会议。
    这次会议还着重讨论了在凉山实行民主改革问题。会议认为：几年来由于中国共产党民族政策的正确贯彻，凉山各族人民和彝族内部团结已经空前加强，政治、经济和文化建设有很大成就，为了进一步发展社会生产力和改善人民的生活，应该采取和缓方式实行民主改革。会议通过了“关于四川省凉山彝族自治州民主改革实施办法”和一些与民主改革有关的决议。
    凉山彝族自治州扩大后的行政区域包括昭觉、美姑、喜德、普格、普雄、布拖、金阳、越嶲、雷波、马边、峨边等11县，面积约35，000方公里，全州彝、汉、苗等族人口约97万多人，其中彝族近80万。
