Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Hong Kong dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek military fighter plane that landed in Hong Kong after being pursued by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force is still parked at Kai Tak Airport. As previously reported, the Chinese government has requested the British authorities in Hong Kong to detain the Chiang Kai-shek plane and the personnel on board.

According to foreign news agencies, the U.S. "Air Force Liaison Office" in Hong Kong is actively conducting so-called "mediation" activities on behalf of the Chiang Kai-shek group in order to "arrange" for this Chiang Kai-shek military aircraft to fly back to Taiwan. Prior to this, the Hong Kong "New Life Evening Post" also reported that before 2:15 PM on February 2nd, a U.S. military aircraft landed at Kai Tak Airport and parked next to the Chiang Kai-shek plane; on the same afternoon, Li Shenglin, the Chiang Kai-shek military pilot, also appeared under the airport control tower. These facts have attracted people's attention.

While the United States is carrying out this conspiracy, American news agencies and Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency have fabricated various lies in an attempt to deny the fact that the plane intruded into the mainland and landed in Hong Kong after being pursued by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force. They described the plane as being on some kind of "training flight" outside the mainland, or on a "routine patrol," "performing a photographic mission," and being "unarmed," etc., full of loopholes. The Hong Kong "South China Morning Post" pointed out these "contradictory explanations" in its editorial on the 4th. The newspaper said, "It should be pointed out that the pilot is a major and is flying alone, which does not look like a trainee." In fact, the United Press International also quoted "well-informed sources" in its report as saying that "the Royal Air Force found this plane being chased from South China to the China Sea by several other jets, which were undoubtedly Communist Chinese planes."

### 美国阴谋劫夺降落香港的蒋机

    美国阴谋劫夺降落香港的蒋机
    新华社4日讯　香港消息：在中国人民解放军空军追击下降落到香港的蒋军战斗机仍停留在启德机场上。前已报道，中国政府已要求香港英国当局将这架蒋机和机上人员予以扣留。
    据外国通讯社报道，美国驻香港的“空军联络办事处”正在替蒋介石集团积极进行所谓“斡旋”活动，以便“安排”这架蒋军飞机飞回台湾。在这之前，香港“新生晚报”还报道说，在2日下午2时15分以前，有美国军用飞机一架降落启德机场，停在蒋军飞机旁边；同日下午，蒋军飞机驾驶员李盛林也曾出现在机场指挥塔下。这些事实引起了人们的注意。
    在美国进行这项阴谋活动同时，美国通讯社和蒋介石的中央社捏造了各种谎言，企图抵赖这架飞机窜犯大陆和在中国人民解放军空军追击下降落香港的事实。而把这架飞机说成是在大陆以外进行什么“训练飞行”，或是“例行的巡逻”、“执行摄影任务”和“没有武装”等等，破绽百出。4日的香港“南华早报”在它的一篇社论中，就曾指出了这种“互相矛盾的解释”。这家报纸说，“应该指出，这位驾驶员是少校，单独飞行，看上去不像个受训人员”。事实上，合众社也曾在其报道中引用“消息灵通人士”的话说，“皇家空军发现这架飞机被其他数架喷气机从华南追到中国海，这些飞机无疑是中共飞机”。
