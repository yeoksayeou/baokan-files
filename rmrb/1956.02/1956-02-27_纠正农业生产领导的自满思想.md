Correcting Complacency in Agricultural Production Leadership
Wang Yingming

With the great development of the agricultural cooperative movement and the initial formulation of overall plans, a vigorous production upsurge has unfolded in Qishui County, Hubei Province. Within just two months, Guankou Township in this county has not only processed and repaired 75 small ponds and a 550-zhang-long river embankment, but also built 3 large ponds and a reservoir; constructed 6 major roads, totaling more than 30 li in length; converted more than 30 mu of stony slopes into flat land, and covered 800 mu of dry land with field soil and pond mud. The township has also added 24 ox carts, and 14 agricultural cooperatives have purchased 24 sets of double-wheeled double-furrow plows; Yongbao Township has transformed 2,400 mu of dry land into irrigated land; Zhuwa Township has turned the famous "Fire Ridge Hill" into "Water Ridge Hill," building a large pond in an area where crops used to dry up and die on 300 mu of land every year. In short, things that were impossible in the past are now being done, and production miracles are constantly emerging.

However, some comrades have developed a sense of pride and complacency as a result. They believe that "production is almost done" and that "there is no problem in completing this year's production tasks," thus relaxing their leadership over the production movement and remaining indifferent to the problems in the production movement. Therefore, at the recent First Congress of the Communist Party of China Qishui County, this ideology was seriously criticized.

The meeting believed that the reason for this complacency is primarily the insufficient understanding of the importance and arduousness of completing this year's agricultural production tasks by some cadres. Although, as early as after September last year, the Party organizations at all levels in Qishui County, following the guidelines of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" put forward by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, had initially conducted overall planning from top to bottom in conjunction with the establishment and rectification of cooperatives; however, due to the short time, the lack of experience of the leading organs, and the insufficient mobilization of the masses, most of the plans were still relatively rough, and there were still quite a few problems. Compared with the requirement of striving to complete the production tasks of 1957 in 1956, the achievements already obtained are still far from sufficient. For example, Gao Yousan, the director of the Gaochao Agricultural Cooperative in Lisi Township, originally thought that the cooperative's production was doing well, but after inspection, it was found that the water conservancy work of the whole cooperative was still not done well. Out of more than 600 mu of land in the whole cooperative, only 300 mu could be guaranteed to resist drought for 60 days, 200 mu could be guaranteed to resist drought for 40 days, and 130 mu could be guaranteed to resist drought for 30 days. Caihe District planned to accumulate 12.38 million dan of fertilizer in winter, but only completed 6.7 million dan, with 45% of the fertilizer accumulation task still unfulfilled. In some places, the original planned figures, although not low, were not followed. For example, one agricultural cooperative originally planned to apply 40 dan of fertilizer per mu of land, but actually only applied 20 dan, and the plan to build pig pens, toilets, and cattle sheds also fell through. All this shows that the Party organizations and Party member cadres at all levels must make greater efforts, take the initiative to lead the masses to realize the plans, and constantly revise and amend the plans according to the situation, in order to ensure the smooth completion of this year's agricultural production tasks. Conversely, if it is believed that "the plans have been made, and the masses will realize them themselves," and thus a laissez-faire attitude is adopted towards production, there is a danger that this year's agricultural production increase plan will fall through.

The meeting believed that another important reason for the complacency is the one-sidedness of some comrades' thinking. They only saw the key areas and key agricultural cooperatives, but not the general areas and general agricultural cooperatives; they only saw the advanced areas and advanced agricultural cooperatives, but not the backward areas and backward agricultural cooperatives; they only saw the advantages and achievements in their work, but not the shortcomings and problems. Yang Dongsheng, the secretary of the Lisi Township Party Branch, confessed at the meeting: "Several of our Party branch members are assigned to several central cooperatives. We only saw that the production order of the central cooperatives was good, the production enthusiasm of the members was high, and the production plans were completed and overfulfilled. We did not thoroughly check the production situation of other cooperatives. In fact, the production order of 18 cooperatives in the township is still very chaotic, and 6 cooperatives have not yet completed their winter production plans." Gao Yousan, the director of the Gaochao Agricultural Cooperative, also confessed that he originally saw that the wheat on the 140 mu of land in the cooperative was growing well, and thought that there was no problem in completing the task of producing 220 jin per mu. In fact, the wheat on more than 200 mu of land in the cooperative was not growing very well, and it was estimated that it could only produce 150 jin per mu; the wheat on more than 150 mu of land was growing very poorly, with large patches of missing seedlings, and it was estimated that it could only produce about 70 or 80 jin per mu.

During the meeting, the representatives also visited Wangcheng Township and the "October" Agricultural Cooperative. They saw with their own eyes that the ground in Wangcheng Township was covered with a thick layer of mud, the spring harvest crops in the fields were growing luxuriantly, the ponds and weirs were built like reservoirs, and the villages were surrounded by roads extending in all directions. This visit was very educational for the representatives. Those who originally thought that the work in their townships was "almost done" felt that it was still far from enough; those who originally thought that there were "no problems" felt that there were still many problems. Before the meeting was even over, some representatives were busy sending letters and making phone calls to their families, telling their families not to be complacent; some sent people back home overnight to hold meetings and arrange for further development of the production movement.

    纠正农业生产领导的自满思想
    王映明
    随着农业合作化运动的大发展和全面规划的初步制定，一个热火朝天的生产高潮已经在湖北省浠水县展开。这个县关口乡在短短的两个月内，除了75口小塘和一条长550丈的河堤已经过加工培修以外，还兴修了3口大塘、一个水库；修了6条大路，共有30多里长；30多石坡地改成了平地，800多石旱地培了田土和塘泥，全乡还添了24辆牛车，14个农业合作社买了24部双轮双铧犁；永保乡的2，400亩旱地变成了水浇地；竹瓦乡把有名的“火岭岗”变成了“水岭岗”，在年年要干死300多石田的庄稼的地方修了一口大塘。总之，过去办不到的事情现在办到了，生产上的奇迹正在不断地出现。
    但是，一部分同志却因此产生了骄傲自满情绪，他们以为“生产搞得差不多了”，“完成今年的生产任务没有问题了”，因而放松了对生产运动的领导，对生产运动中的问题不问不闻。因此，在最近召开的中共浠水县第一届代表大会上，对这种思想进行了严肃的批判。
    会议认为，产生这种自满思想的原因，首先是部分干部对完成今年的农业生产任务的重要性和艰巨性认识不足。虽然早在去年9月以后，浠水县的各级党组织就遵照党中央和毛泽东同志提出的“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，自上而下地结合建社和整社，初步进行了全面规划；但是由于时间短，领导机关缺乏经验，群众发动不够充分，因而大多数的规划还比较粗糙，问题还相当多。把已经获得的成绩同争取在1956年完成1957年的生产任务的要求相比还相差很远。如栗寺乡高潮农业合作社主任高有三，原以为社里的生产搞得不错，但经过检查以后，发现全社的水利工作还搞得很不好。全社有600多石田，只有300石田可以保证抗旱60天，200石田保证抗旱40天，130石田保证抗旱30天。蔡河区计划冬季积肥1，238万石，只完成了670万石，还有45％的积肥任务没有完成。还有一些地方原来的计划数字虽然订得不低，但也没有照着执行。例如，有个农业合作社原计划每石田施肥40石，实际只施肥20石，修猪圈、厕所和牛栏的计划也落了空。所有这些都说明，各级党的组织和党员干部还必须作更大的努力，积极主动地领导群众实现规划，并且根据情况不断地增订和修改规划，才有可能保证今年的农业生产任务顺利地完成。反之，如果认为“规划订了，群众自己会实现”，因而对生产采取放任自流的态度，这样，今年的农业增产计划就有落空的危险。
    会议认为，产生自满思想的另一个重要原因，是某些同志的思想有片面性。他们只看见了重点地区和重点农业合作社，没有看见一般地区和一般农业合作社；只看见先进地区和先进农业合作社，没有看见落后地区和落后农业合作社；只看见了工作中的优点和成绩，没有看见缺点和问题。栗寺乡党支部书记杨东生在会上检查说：“我们几个党支部委员都分配在几个中心社里，只看到中心社的生产秩序好，社员的生产积极性高，生产计划完成和超额完成了，就没有深入地检查其他社的生产情况。其实，全乡还有18个合作社的生产秩序很混乱，6个社的冬季生产计划还没有完成。”高潮农业合作社的主任高有三也检查说，他原来看见社里的140石田的小麦长得好，就以为全社完成每亩产220斤的任务没有问题。其实，社里还有200多石田的小麦长得不很好，估计每亩只能产150斤；150多石田的小麦长得很不好，大块大块地缺苗，每亩约计只能产七、八十斤。
    在会议期间，代表们还参观了望城乡和“十月”农业合作社。他们亲眼看见：望城乡地里是厚厚的一层泥巴，畈里的春收作物长得青乌乌的，塘堰修得像水库一样，村边是四通八达的马路。这次参观对代表们的教育很大，原来认为自己乡里的工作“差不多”的，觉得还差得很远；原来认为“没有问题”的，觉得问题还不少。还没有等会议结束，有些代表就忙着往家里寄信，打电话，要家里的人不要自满松气；有的派人连夜赶回家去召开会议，布置进一步开展生产运动。
