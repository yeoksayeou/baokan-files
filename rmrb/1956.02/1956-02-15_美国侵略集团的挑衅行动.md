    Provocative Actions of the U.S. Aggressor Bloc

    Under the instigation of the United States, the Manila Treaty Organization is holding provocative military exercises starting on the 15th. At the same time, the United States will also hold large-scale exercises on Iwo Jima involving "dropping dummy atomic bombs." This is a provocative action by the United States to escalate international tensions following Dulles's speech on the "brink of war" policy.

    The Manila Treaty Organization's exercises are being conducted under the pretext of "defending Southeast Asia from Communist aggression." Of course, this "anti-communist" cliché is merely a hypocritical facade. As Premier Zhou Enlai stated in his political report: "The U.S. aggressor bloc, under the banner of opposing communism, is fabricating a series of lies, entirely to cover up its own preparations for war and aggression."

    What exactly is the purpose of the U.S. in instigating these exercises? The answer to this question can be found in the reports of the U.S. news agencies in recent days. The U.S. propaganda machine has already made lengthy and provocative publicity for these military activities. They are fanatically touting a "policy of strength," calling these exercises a "strong link." They are clamoring that the U.S. Air Force will dispatch F-84G fighter-bombers to participate, and that they want to make "Asians know that this is a weapon that can carry and drop atomic bombs." They also arrogantly claim that these exercises are meant to "convince non-Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries like India and Burma that the U.S. policy—being prepared to fight when necessary—is not just empty rhetoric from Washington." It is clear that the military exercises held by the U.S. near Bangkok are solely for the purpose of provoking and intimidating the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries, in order to create a "brink of war" atmosphere in Asia.

    The U.S. choice of such a time to hold provocative exercises is by no means accidental. People know that recently, there have been a series of important developments in the Asian situation. The new high tide of the Chinese economy, the victorious progress of the Chinese socialist revolution, and China's efforts to promote a peaceful foreign policy have greatly enhanced the international prestige of the People's Republic of China, and have had a profound impact on Asia and the world. The policies of countries led by Asian nationalists, especially India's opposition to military blocs, advocacy of peaceful cooperation, and striving for national industrialization to ensure national political and economic independence, have resonated widely and deeply in many Asian countries that have been, or still are, subjected to the U.S.'s policy of aggression. The struggle of Middle Eastern and Near Eastern countries to safeguard sovereignty and independence and oppose colonialism is advancing on a broad scale, and the imperialist policy of organizing military blocs has been fiercely criticized by the public in these countries. Under these circumstances, the U.S. once wanted to use the clamor of the so-called "brink of war" to intimidate the Chinese people and the Asian people. However, the people of the world and the people of Asia have mercilessly dealt a crushing blow to this so-called "brink of war" intimidation policy. Because the paper tiger has been exposed and it is deeply afraid, and because it stubbornly refuses to recognize the right of the people of Asian countries to strive for and safeguard the independence of their own countries, it has held this exercise to flaunt its military might, following the bankruptcy of the "brink of war" clamor. It vainly attempts to use the already bankrupt "policy of strength" to change the face and direction of Asia. This is the most appropriate annotation of the U.S. officials' statement that this exercise has "political significance."

    The military exercises of the Manila Treaty Organization, orchestrated by the U.S., are a provocation to the People's Republic of China and Asian countries such as India and Burma, and also put pressure on the member states of this military bloc, in an attempt to eliminate its increasingly obvious centrifugal tendencies. The lukewarm attitude of most member states of the Manila Treaty Organization towards being invited to participate in this exercise is the best proof of this tendency.

    These exercises can never intimidate the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries, and cannot bring any convenience to its aggressive policy of promoting military blocs in Asia. The United States wants to intimidate the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries; this practice is futile, on the contrary, it can only arouse greater anger and opposition from the Asian people, and can only show that the U.S. policy of organizing military blocs has encountered increasingly serious difficulties. All of this can only lead to one conclusion: the "policy of strength" has suffered and will continue to suffer more and more miserable failures.

    The "policy of strength" has become an extremely ugly word in international affairs. The people of all countries express their firm contempt for this already bankrupt policy and demand that all international disputes be resolved through consultation. In his recent political report to the CPPCC, our Premier Zhou Enlai put forward proposals for convening a Far East conference and a Geneva conference, promoting Sino-U.S. talks, and establishing collective security in the Asian and Pacific regions. The propositions put forward by our Premier are the common demands of all the people in the Asian and Pacific regions, and are aimed at easing the tense situation and consolidating peace in this region. However, the U.S. aggressor bloc is proving by its actions that it is determined to carry out intimidation and provocation, rather than accept our peaceful proposals. Their intention to push Asia to the "brink of war" is extremely obvious. Their intention can only make themselves increasingly isolated on the edge of the cliff.

### 美国侵略集团的挑衅行动

    美国侵略集团的挑衅行动
    在美国的策划下，马尼拉条约组织在15日起举行挑衅性的军事演习。与此同时，美国还将在琉璜岛举行“投掷假的原子弹”的大规模演习。这是美国继杜勒斯发表“战争边缘”政策的谈话后加剧国际紧张局势的挑衅行动。
    马尼拉条约组织的演习是在所谓“为了保卫东南亚免受共产党侵略”的借口下进行的。当然，这种“反共”的滥调，仅仅是一个虚伪的幌子。正如周恩来总理在政治报告中所说的：“美国侵略集团打着反对共产主义的旗帜，制造一系列的谎言，完全是为了掩盖它自己准备战争和进行侵略。”
    美国策动举行这次演习的目的究竟何在呢？这个问题的答案，是可以从美国通讯社连日来的报道中找到的。美国的宣传机构，对这次军事活动早已作了连篇累牍的挑衅性的宣传。它们狂热地鼓吹“实力政策”，把这次演习称为“坚固的环节”的演习。它们叫嚣美国空军将派遣F—84G式的战斗轰炸机前来参加，并且要使“亚洲人知道这是一种能够携带和投掷原子弹的武器”。它们还狂妄地声称，这次演习要使“印度和缅甸等非东南亚条约组织国家相信：美国的政策——作好在必要时作战准备——不仅仅是华盛顿发出的空洞的回声。”由此可见，美国在曼谷附近举行的军事演习，只是为了向中国人民和亚洲国家的人民进行挑衅和恫吓，以达到在亚洲制造“战争边缘”气氛的目的。
    美国选择这样一个时机举行挑衅性的演习，决不是偶然的。人们知道，最近以来，亚洲局势有了一系列的重要发展。中国经济的新的高涨，中国社会主义革命的胜利进行和中国努力推行的和平外交政策，大大地提高了中华人民共和国的国际威望，在亚洲和世界发生了深远的影响。亚洲民族主义者领导的国家，特别是印度反对军事集团、主张和平合作、力求国家工业化以保证国家的政治和经济独立的政策，在许多曾经或者至今仍然受到美国侵略政策的奴役的亚洲国家中引起了广泛深刻的共鸣。中近东国家维护主权和独立、反对殖民主义的斗争，正在广阔的规模上向前推进，帝国主义组织军事集团的政策遭到了这些国家公众的猛烈抨击。在这种情势之下，美国曾经想以所谓“战争边缘”的叫嚣来吓倒中国人民和亚洲人民。但是，世界人民和亚洲人民却毫不容情地给了这种所谓“战争边缘”的恐吓政策以粉碎性的打击。由于纸老虎被戳穿了而深深害怕，由于它顽固地拒绝承认亚洲各国人民有权争取和维护自己的国家的独立，因此紧跟着“战争边缘”的叫嚣破产之后，它就举行这次炫耀武力的演习。它妄想用早已破产了的“实力政策”，来改变亚洲的面貌和方向。这就是美国官员把这次演习说成具有“政治意义”的最为恰当的注解。
    由美国策划的马尼拉条约组织的军事演习，是对中华人民共和国和印度、缅甸等亚洲国家的挑衅，而且也对这个军事集团的成员国施加压力，以图消除它的内部日益明显的离心倾向。马尼拉条约组织的大多数成员国对于被邀请参加这次演习所反映的冷淡态度，就是这种倾向的最好证明。
    这次演习决不可能吓倒中国人民和亚洲各国人民，决不可能给它在亚洲推行军事集团的侵略政策带来什么便利。美国想对中国人民和亚洲其他国家的人民进行恫吓；这种作法是徒劳的，恰恰相反，它只能引起亚洲人民的更大的愤怒和反对，只能说明美国组织军事集团的政策遭到了越来越严重的困难。所有这一切，都只能导向一个结论：“实力政策”已经遭到、并将继续遭到愈来愈惨的失败。
    “实力政策”在国际事务中已经成为一个异常丑恶的字眼。各国人民对于这一早已破产了的政策表示坚决的鄙弃，并要求以协商的方式来解决一切国际争端。我国总理周恩来最近在政协会议上所作的政治报告中，提出了召开远东会议和日内瓦会议、促进中美会谈以及建立亚洲和太平洋地区集体安全的建议。我国总理提出的这些主张是亚洲和太平洋地区所有人民的共同要求，是为了和缓这个地区的紧张局势和巩固和平。而美国侵略集团却以行动来证明它定要进行恐吓挑衅，而不要我国的和平建议。他们想把亚洲推到“战争边缘”上去的用心是异常明显的。他们的这种用心只能使他们自己在悬崖的边缘上日益孤立。
