    Oppose the Joint Measures of the US and Britain in the Near and Middle East
    Cui Qi
    On February 13, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the measures taken by the United States and Britain in the Near and Middle East. It pointed out that the joint statement of the US-British talks in Washington stipulated certain joint measures for the Near and Middle East. These measures will certainly endanger the peace and security of the Near and Middle East, and will certainly undermine the independence and sovereignty of the countries in the region, which violates the principles and purposes of the United Nations. As a country close to the Near and Middle East, the Soviet Union cannot but express its legitimate concern about this situation. The Soviet government reiterated its adherence to the principle of peaceful diplomacy, defended the countries in the Near and Middle East from interference, and would work with other relevant countries to consolidate the security of the region.
    The US and Britain held talks in Washington behind the backs of the Near and Middle Eastern countries, avoided the United Nations, excluded other relevant countries, and secretly discussed the Near and Middle East issue and made unilateral decisions, which was fundamentally illegal. This matter has aroused widespread opposition from Arab countries. They have successively sent joint memorandums to the United States and lodged joint protests, warning the US and Britain not to make any decisions on the Near and Middle East without the consent of the Arab countries. The Soviet statement is a strong support for the Arab countries. This fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's position of firmly safeguarding peace in the Near and Middle East and fully respecting the rights of the countries in the region.
    The Washington negotiators tried to convince people that their purpose of intervention was nothing more than to "resolve" the dispute between Israel and Arab countries. If so, then why not let the countries concerned participate? Why not bring it to the United Nations for discussion? And they are prepared to send troops to Palestine, how is this the same as solving the Palestine problem? On the contrary, this approach will only create dangerous friction and a tense atmosphere in the region, making the Palestine problem even more difficult to solve.
    In order to conceal this military intervention plan, British Prime Minister Eden stated in the House of Commons on February 14 that Britain would "firmly abide by" the Tripartite Declaration issued in 1950, and he insisted that this approach was "completely consistent" with the United Nations Charter. On the same day, a British Foreign Office spokesman also described the Tripartite Declaration as a talisman for the countries in the Near and Middle East, as if the US, Britain, and France had a "responsibility" to take action to "support" their "friends." However, no one wants to listen to this deceptive platitude anymore. Everyone knows that when the Tripartite Declaration was issued in 1950, Arab countries pointed out that this was a signboard for Western countries to divide spheres of influence in the Near and Middle East, and it seriously violated the independence and freedom of Arab countries. Therefore, the seven countries of the Arab League issued a joint reply on the Tripartite Declaration on June 21, 1950, stating that they "will never tolerate any actions that would undermine their sovereignty or independence." Recently, the Egyptian "Al Akhbar" also pointed out: "The 1950 Tripartite Declaration itself violates the United Nations Charter. This declaration was announced while circumventing the United Nations organization, ignoring the lofty purpose of the United Nations, and infringing on the powers of the United Nations."
    The reason why the Washington negotiators want to interfere in the affairs of the Near and Middle East in the most brutal way is because they feel that the colonial status in the Near and Middle East is crumbling. The Baghdad Pact organized by Britain and the United States is facing increasingly strong resistance from Arab countries. The people of Arab countries, led by Egypt, are determined to completely get rid of the enslavement and exploitation of imperialism and strive for the independent development of their countries. Under such circumstances, Western colonialists are desperately trying to deceive the people of the Near and Middle East by strengthening economic "aid," while increasingly resorting to the so-called policy of military deterrence. Recently, Britain expressed its intention to postpone the withdrawal of its troops stationed in the Suez Canal, while sending more troops to Cyprus. The United States plans to hold large-scale military exercises in the eastern Mediterranean and increase the "visits" of the Sixth Fleet based in the Mediterranean to Near Eastern countries in order to "show strength" and intimidate. The plan revealed in the US-British talks to send "United Nations troops" to Palestine to "maintain order" is obviously part of this policy of military deterrence.
    Of course, the Washington negotiators did not resolve the contradictions between them when formulating these "joint measures" to interfere in the Near and Middle East. On the contrary, these insatiable colonial plunderers are readjusting their spheres of influence according to their military and economic strength in the region, which has intensified the struggle between them. They want to use the form of separate talks to cover up the contradictions between them, but this form ultimately only benefits the United States. Everyone knows that whenever the United States and Britain or the United States, Britain, and France hold separate talks, their positions are always unequal, and the United States always gets more convenient conditions to force its opponents to make concessions. Recently, the Associated Press reported that Americans believe that Britain has failed in many places, leaving only one way to go: "Make the United Kingdom accept the leadership of the United States in implementing Western policy in the region (referring to the Near and Middle East)."
    Western colonial countries are fundamentally unwilling to recognize the reality of the Near and Middle East, and this is where they are unlucky. They still regard this region as an object of plunder and a battleground for imperialists. However, as the Egyptian "Al Akhbar" said, "The Washington talks will not shake the determination of the people of Arab countries to defend their rights and maintain their independence. The future of Arab countries is neither decided by London nor by Washington, but by the people of Arab countries themselves. Arab countries will never allow foreign interference in their affairs." It is clear that whoever does not recognize this truth is bound to run into a wall.

    反对美英对中近东的联合措施
    崔奇
    2月13日，苏联外交部就美英在中近东的措施发表了声明。它指出，美英在华盛顿会谈联合声明中对中近东规定了某些联合措施，这些措施，肯定地会危害中近东的和平和安全，并且肯定地会破坏这个地区的国家的独立和主权，而这是违反联合国的原则和宗旨的。作为靠近中近东地区的国家，苏联不能不对这种局势表示正当的关切。苏联政府重申它坚守和平外交政策的原则，保卫中近东地区的国家不受干涉，并将同其他有关国家一起来努力使这个地区的安全得到巩固。
    美英在华盛顿会谈中背着中近东国家，躲开联合国，排斥其他有关国家，偷偷摸摸地讨论中近东问题，并作出片面决定，这根本就是非法的。这件事情已经引起阿拉伯国家的普遍反对。它们先后向美国致送联合备忘录，并提出联合抗议，警告美英不要在没有阿拉伯国家的同意下作出关于中近东的任何决定。苏联的声明，是对阿拉伯国家的一个有力的支持。这充分表现了苏联坚决维护中近东和平和充分尊重这个地区的国家的权利的立场。
    华盛顿的会谈者企图使人相信，他们干涉的目的无非是为了“解决”以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的纠纷问题。如果是这样，那末为什么不让有关国家参加呢？为什么不拿到联合国里去讨论呢？而且他们准备派军队到巴勒斯坦去，这又同解决巴勒斯坦问题有什么相同之点呢？相反地，这样做法只会在那个地区造成危险的摩擦和紧张的空气，从而使巴勒斯坦问题更加难以解决。
    为了掩饰这种军事干涉计划，英国首相艾登2月14日在下院演说时表示，英国将“坚决遵守”1950年发表的三国宣言，他硬说这种做法同联合国宪章“完全一致”。同一天，英国外交部发言人也把三国宣言说成是中近东国家的护身符，仿佛美英法有“责任”采取行动“支援”它们的“朋友”。但是，这种骗人的滥调早就没有什么人愿意听了。谁都知道，还在1950年三国宣言发表的时候，阿拉伯国家就指出，这是西方国家在中近东地区分割势力范围的一块招牌，它严重侵犯阿拉伯国家的独立自由。因此，阿拉伯联盟的七个国家在1950年6月21日曾就三国宣言发表联合答复说，它们“决不容忍任何会破坏它们的主权或独立的行动”。最近，埃及“消息报”也指出：“1950年三国宣言本身就是违背联合国宪章的。这一宣言是在回避联合国组织的情况下宣布的，它无视联合国的崇高宗旨，并且侵犯联合国的职权。”
    华盛顿的会谈者所以要用最粗暴的方式来干涉中近东事务，是因为他们感到在中近东的殖民地位已经摇摇欲坠了。英国和美国所组织的巴格达条约正遭受阿拉伯国家越来越强烈的反抗。以埃及为首的阿拉伯各国人民决心彻底摆脱帝国主义的奴役和剥削，争取自己国家的独立发展。在这种情况下，西方殖民主义者一边极力想用加强经济“援助”的办法来欺骗中近东人民，一边就越来越乞灵于所谓武力威慑政策。最近，英国表示要延期撤退它在苏彝士运河的驻军，同时向塞浦路斯增兵。美国打算在地中海东部举行军事大演习，并增加以地中海为基地的第六舰队到近东国家的“访问”，以便“显示实力”，进行恫吓。美英会谈中所透露出来的关于派遣“联合国军队”到巴勒斯坦去“保持秩序”的计划，显然也就是这种武力威慑政策的一部分。
    当然，华盛顿会谈者在制定这些干涉中近东的“联合措施”的时候，并没有解决它们之间的矛盾。恰恰相反，这些贪得无厌的殖民掠夺者，正在按照他们在这个地区的军事和经济实力重新调整他们的势力范围，这就加剧了他们之间的斗争。他们想用单独会谈的形式来掩饰他们之间的矛盾，可是这种形式归根到底只是对美国有利而已。大家知道，每逢英美或者英美法单独会谈时，它们之间的地位总是不平等的，美国总是得到更方便的条件来压迫它的对手让步。最近，合众社就报道过美国人认为英国已经在好多地方失败了，只剩下一条路可走：“使联合王国接受美国在该地区（指中近东）执行西方政策方面的领导权。”
    西方殖民国家根本不愿意承认中近东的现实，这就是它们倒霉的地方，它们仍然把这个地区看作帝国主义者的掠夺对象和角逐场所。但是，正同埃及“消息报”所说的，“华盛顿会谈丝毫也不会动摇阿拉伯各国人民保卫他们的权利和维护他们的独立的决心。阿拉伯各国的前途既不由伦敦决定，也不由华盛顿决定，它是由阿拉伯各国人民自己来决定的。阿拉伯国家决不允许外国干涉它们的事务。”很显然，谁不承认这个真理，谁就一定要碰壁。
