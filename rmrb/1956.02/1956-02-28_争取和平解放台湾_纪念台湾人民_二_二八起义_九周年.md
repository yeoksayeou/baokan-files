"Strive for the Peaceful Liberation of Taiwan"
——Commemorating the Ninth Anniversary of the "February 28th Uprising" of the Taiwanese People——
Li Chunqing, Vice Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League

The armed uprising of the Taiwanese people on February 28, 1947, against the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek was also a patriotic movement against the US support for Chiang Kai-shek's instigation of the civil war and against US aggression against China, including aggression against Taiwan. The goal of the Taiwanese people's revolutionary struggle is consistent with the goal of the mainland people's revolutionary struggle. Nine years have passed, and compatriots on the mainland have long been free and liberated, but the Taiwanese people are still living a life of slavery, and Taiwan is still under US military occupation; it is like a thorn stuck in the hearts of the Chinese people, causing constant pain.

The United States is not unaware that its occupation of Taiwan is an unreasonable act. In order to find an excuse for occupying Taiwan, the US State Department declared on January 21 this year that "the United States is not occupying Taiwan," but because it has a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek, the United States has the "right and responsibility" to "stay" in Taiwan. What is the status of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan? What is the relationship between him and the United States? We might as well ask former US President Truman to answer this question. On February 2 this year, Truman said in New York that the Eisenhower government, upon taking office, claimed that it "wanted to unleash Chiang Kai-shek," and "as a result, Chiang Kai-shek was tied up again in a situation that made the United States a laughingstock to the world." That is to say, in fact, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is locked in an American cage, can be "unleashed" at will, and can be "tied up" at will like American-owned livestock. What can a Chiang Kai-shek who can be "unleashed" and "tied up" at will by the United States represent? Therefore, any "mutual defense treaty" signed between Chiang Kai-shek and the United States cannot generate any "rights and responsibilities" at all, and the United States has absolutely no reason to "stay" in Taiwan.

The US State Department also said: "Taiwan has never been a part of Communist China." May I ask, which country is Taiwan a part of? In the face of facts and justice, the United States of course cannot say that Taiwan is a part of the United States. The US State Department's propaganda instructions on Taiwan policy issued on December 23, 1949, also admitted that "Taiwan is politically, geographically, and strategically a part of China." As long as the US State Department admits this point, the remaining question is who represents China. As mentioned earlier, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is entirely an object in the American cage, and it certainly cannot represent China. Just by looking at the map, people can know where China is. For thousands of years, China has been in its current location, that is, in the eastern half of the globe, there is a China with a land area exceeding that of the United States and a population more than four times that of the United States – the dignified People's Republic of China. Only it is China. Taiwan is a part of China, and after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan became a part of the People's Republic of China. This is extremely simple logic. Therefore, the US occupation of Taiwan is the occupation of Taiwan of the People's Republic of China.

As everyone knows, Taiwan is an island, and to occupy an island, one must first occupy its surrounding sea area. The United States uses its military force—the Seventh Fleet—to occupy the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has been surrounded by the US Navy. The United States not only occupies the sea area of Taiwan, but also controls the island of Taiwan. The United States rotates a team of jet fighter air force in Taiwan, has a so-called "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" that completely controls the Kuomintang army, and also has other military institutions and military bases. Taiwan is more than 5,000 nautical miles away from the United States and has nothing to do with US defense and security; Taiwan's affairs are China's internal affairs and have nothing to do with the United States; why does the United States want to occupy Taiwan? Obviously, the main purpose of the US occupation of Taiwan and obstruction of China's complete reunification is to use Taiwan as a military base, attempting to attack the Chinese mainland and launch a war of aggression.

The Chinese people have the right to defend their motherland's territory from aggression and the sacred responsibility to unify their own country; the Chinese people, including the Taiwanese people, will never allow the United States to blatantly occupy Taiwan. The People's Republic of China and its 600 million people, who have appeared on the world stage as a giant, will forge ahead courageously and liberate their own territory, Taiwan, no matter how rugged the road may be. However, for the benefit of the people of China and the United States, and for the peace of the Far East and the world, we hope to eliminate the tension in the Taiwan region through peaceful consultations—let all US armed forces withdraw from Taiwan.

All Chinese people in Taiwan, including Taiwanese compatriots and personnel who fled from the mainland, should unite on the patriotic stand and oppose the US occupation of our territory, Taiwan. China's internal affairs should be resolved by the Chinese themselves. Kuomintang military and political personnel should think about it: The Kuomintang reactionary government ruled China for more than 20 years, making the country impoverished and the people living in misery. Finally, it led to the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty. You all fled to Taiwan after the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty. You should know that today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the face of the country has fundamentally changed in just a few years. From the Xing'an Mountains in the northeast to the Himalayan mountains in the southwest, from the Tarim River in Xinjiang to the west coast of the Taiwan Strait, there is no place that does not present a thriving atmosphere, and no one is not excitedly working and full of joy. All the facts are proving that the Chinese people have found the correct and inevitable path, which leads China to prosperity and strength. Today, the broad road is the desire of the people, and 600 million people are united like one person, working together to dedicate all their strength to building a great motherland. If the Chiang Kai-shek clique still has a little bit of national consciousness, it should resolutely break away from the United States, abandon personal gains and personal ambitions, respect the form of government chosen by 600 million people, admit their mistakes and repent to the people of the motherland, and gladly return.

On January 30 this year, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, announced: "Anyone who is willing to take the road of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, no matter who they are, no matter how great their past crimes, the Chinese people will treat them leniently and not hold them accountable for the past." Are you willing to take the road of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, which is beneficial to the country and yourselves, or are you willing to take the dead end with no future? Either live with glory, or die and leave a bad name, which way to go, a choice should be made. Taiwanese compatriots hope to get rid of foreign rule, and also hope that you will no longer act as accomplices of tigers and oppress your own compatriots. You should understand the power of the "February 28th Uprising" of the Taiwanese people, and know that you are eking out your lives on the volcano of hatred of the Taiwanese people. But Taiwanese compatriots are all sons and daughters of the motherland and have the broad mind of the Chinese nation. Since the motherland has announced a lenient policy towards you, as long as you are willing to work together with Taiwanese compatriots to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, Taiwanese compatriots will also not hold you accountable for the past and will forgive you.

At a time when the Chinese people are fighting for the liberation of Taiwan and foreign invaders, when Taiwanese compatriots are looking forward to being liberated and returning to the motherland day and night, and on the solemn day commemorating the "February 28th Uprising" patriotic movement, the traitor Liao Wenyi, under the orders of his American masters in Tokyo, attempted to split China's territory of Taiwan and establish a so-called "Provisional Government of the Republic of Taiwan" in order to create a basis for the United States to occupy Taiwan for a long time under the guise of "trusteeship." Liao Wenyi said: "Taiwan is Taiwan for Taiwanese people." This fallacy cannot withstand refutation. Taiwanese people are all Chinese people, the vast majority are Han people, and the ancestral tablets in the homes of the vast majority of Taiwanese people can explain that this family moved from a certain county and township on the mainland, and the tombstones on the graves of their ancestors can also explain that the deceased was from a certain county and township on the mainland. They speak Chinese and harbor a patriotic heart. Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and has belonged to Fujian Province for more than 500 years, just as Hainan Island belongs to Guangdong Province. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory.

Today is the ninth anniversary of the "February 28th Uprising," and we miss our Taiwanese compatriots very much. Although you spend this blood-soaked day in silence, the 300-year-old patriotic revolutionary tradition of the Taiwanese people and the tens of thousands of martyrs who sacrificed in the "February 28th Uprising" will stand on the peak of the world and declare the will of the Taiwanese people: We demand that the United States withdraw its aggressive hands, we demand the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and we demand to return to the embrace of our motherland.

The goal of the "February 28th Uprising" will surely be achieved.

Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed for the Taiwan revolution!

    “争取和平解放台湾”
    ——纪念台湾人民“二·二八起义”九周年——
    台湾民主自治同盟副主席　李纯青
    1947年2月28日台湾人民武装起义反对蒋介石黑暗统治，也是反对美国支持蒋介石发动内战、反对美国侵略中国包括侵略台湾的爱国运动。台湾人民革命斗争的目标和祖国人民革命斗争的目标是一致的。9年过去了，大陆同胞早已获得自由解放，但台湾人民还在过着奴隶的生活，台湾还在美国武力占领之下；它像一根刺扎在中国人的心里，时时发生着剧痛。
    美国不是不知道侵占台湾是无理的行为。为了寻找霸占台湾的借口，今年1月21日美国国务院声明说：“美国不是霸占台湾”，而是因为它和蒋介石订有所谓“共同防御条约”，美国就有“留在”台湾的“权利和责任”。究竟蒋介石集团在台湾所处的地位怎样？他和美国的关系又是怎样呢？我们不妨请美国前任总统杜鲁门回答这一问题。今年2月2日杜鲁门在纽约说：艾森豪威尔政府一上台就声称“要放蒋介石出笼”，“结果又在一种使美国成为全世界的笑柄的情况下把蒋介石拴起来了”。这就是说，事实上，蒋介石集团，它被关在美国的笼里，可以随便“放出笼”，它像美国私有的牲口一样，可以随便“拴起来”。一个可以随便由美国“放出笼”和“拴起来”的蒋介石，他能代表什么呢？因此，蒋介石和美国签订的什么“共同防御条约”，根本不能产生任何“权利和责任”，美国也完全没有理由“留在”台湾。
    美国国务院又说：“台湾从来也不是共产党中国的一部分”，请问：台湾到底是哪个国家的一部分呢？在事实和正义面前，美国当然无法说台湾是美国的一部分。1949年12月23日美国国务院发出的关于台湾政策宣传指示也承认：“台湾在政治上、地理上和战略上都是中国的一部分。”只要美国国务院承认这一点，剩下的问题就是谁代表中国了。如前所说，蒋介石集团完全是美国的笼中之物，它当然不能代表中国。只要看一看地图，人们就可以知道哪儿是中国。几千年来，中国都在那个现在所在的地方，即在地球的东半部，有个土地面积超过于美国、人口为美国四倍多的中国——堂堂的中华人民共和国。只有它才是中国。台湾是中国的一部分，在中华人民共和国成立以后，台湾便是中华人民共和国的一部分。这是极其简单的逻辑。因此，美国霸占台湾，就是霸占中华人民共和国的台湾。
    大家知道，台湾是一个海岛，霸占海岛首先要霸占它的周围海面，美国使用它的武力——第七舰队侵占着台湾海峡。台湾已被美国海军所包围。美国不但占领台湾的海面，而且控制着台湾本岛，美国在台湾轮驻着一队喷气机空军，有一个完全控制国民党军队的所谓“美国军事援助顾问团”，还有其他的军事机构和军事基地。台湾距离美国5，000多浬，和美国的国防和安全风马牛不相及；台湾的事务是中国内部的事务，与美国无干；为什么美国要霸占台湾呢？很明显地，美国侵占台湾、阻挠中国的完全统一，其主要目的在于利用台湾作军事基地，企图进攻中国大陆、发动侵略战争。
    中国人民有保护祖国领土不受侵略的自卫权利，有统一自己国家的神圣责任；中国人民包括台湾人民绝不许可美国蛮横地霸占台湾。以巨人姿态出现在世界舞台的中华人民共和国及其6亿人民，不管道路多么崎岖，必将奋勇前进，解放自己的领土台湾。但是为了中美两国人民的利益，为了远东及世界和平，我们希望通过和平协商的道路，消除台湾地区的紧张局势——让美国的一切武装力量撤离台湾。
    所有在台湾的中国人，包括台湾同胞和从大陆跑去的人员，都应当在爱国的立场上团结起来，反对美国侵占我国的领土台湾。中国内部的事务，应由中国人自己来解决。国民党军政人员应该想一想：国民党反动政府统治中国20多年，弄得国家雕敝，民不聊生。终于导致蒋介石王朝的灭亡。你们都是在蒋介石王朝灭亡以后逃到台湾去的。你们应该知道，今天中国在共产党领导下，短短几年中，国家面貌已经根本改变，从东北的兴安岭上，到西南的喜马拉雅山边，从新疆的塔里木河，到台湾海峡的西岸，没有一块地方不是呈现欣欣向荣的气象，没有一个人不在兴奋工作而喜气洋洋。一切事实都在证明：中国人民已经找到正确的也是必然的道路，这条道路使中国走上繁荣富强。今天的大路是天下归心，6万万人团结得像一个人一样，齐心协力地为建设伟大的祖国献出一切力量。如果蒋介石集团人员还有一点点民族意识，就应该断然和美国脱离关系，抛弃个人得失和个人野心，尊重6万万人所选择的政府形式，向祖国人民认错悔罪，欣然来归。
    今年1月30日周恩来总理代表中国人民和中国政府宣布：“凡是愿意走和平解放台湾道路的，不管任何人，也不管他们过去犯过多大罪过，中国人民都将宽大对待，不究既往。”你们愿意走对国家和自己都有好处的和平解放台湾的道路呢，还是愿意走死亡无日的绝路？或者是生而光荣，或者是死而遗臭，何去何从，应有所选择。台湾同胞希望摆脱外国的统治，也希望你们不再为虎作伥，欺压自己的同胞。你们应该了解“二·二八起义”台湾人民的力量，要知道你们是在台湾人民仇恨的火山上苟延残喘的。但是台湾同胞都是祖国的儿女，具有中国民族广阔的胸怀，既然祖国宣布了对你们的宽大政策，只要你们愿意和台湾同胞一起，共同为和平解放台湾而努力，台湾同胞就也将不究既往，宽恕你们。
    在中国人民为解放台湾和外国侵略者进行斗争的时候，在台湾同胞日夜盼望获得解放回归祖国的时候，在纪念“二·二八起义”爱国运动的庄严日子，竟有汉奸廖文毅，在东京奉美国主子之命，妄图分裂中国的领土台湾，成立所谓“台湾共和国临时政府”，以便替美国长期霸占台湾制造“托管”的根据。廖文毅说：“台湾是台湾人的台湾。”这个谬论是经不起驳斥的。台湾人都是中国人，绝大多数都是汉人，绝大多数台湾人的住宅里的神主木牌便可以说明这一家是从大陆某县某乡迁移过来的，他们祖宗的坟墓上的石碑也可以说明这个死者是大陆何县何乡的人，他们讲的是中国的话，藏着的是一颗爱国的心。台湾自古以来是中国的领土，在历史上有500多年属于福建省，像海南岛属于广东省一样，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。
    今天是“二·二八起义”九周年纪念日，我们格外怀念着台湾同胞。尽管在这个血洗的日子里你们无言度过，但台湾人民300多年爱国的革命传统以至“二·二八起义”中牺牲的千万烈士都将站在世界的高峰，宣布台湾人民的意志：我们要求美国缩回侵略的手，我们要求和平解放台湾，我们要求回到自己的祖国怀抱里来。
    “二·二八起义”的目的必将达到。
    为台湾革命牺牲的烈士永垂不朽！
