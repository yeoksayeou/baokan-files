    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steelmaking Plant Youth Friendship Furnace
    Creates Unprecedented Record in Rapid Steelmaking
    On the 23rd, the Youth Friendship Furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant, led by Li Shangzhong, a rapid steelmaking expert, produced a furnace of steel in only 6 and a half hours, once again setting a new national record for rapid steelmaking in large open-hearth furnaces. This is 3 hours and 15 minutes shorter than the national planned steelmaking time, and the quality of the steel is fully qualified.
    Li Shangzhong and the steelmaking workers further studied the Soviet Kolesnikov's experience in rapid steelmaking, used new steelmaking methods, added ore and limestone immediately after tapping the steel, then carried out high-temperature rapid furnace repair and rapid charging, and high-temperature addition of molten iron. The entire steelmaking operation was carried out at high temperature, thus creating an unprecedented record for rapid steelmaking.
    Since Kolesnikov demonstrated rapid steelmaking in the Youth Friendship Furnace on October 8 last year, Li Shangzhong and the Class B steelmaking workers have successively created four records for rapid steelmaking in large open-hearth furnaces: 7 hours 20 minutes, 7 hours, 6 hours 40 minutes, and 6 and a half hours.

    鞍钢炼钢厂青年友谊炉
    创造快速炼钢空前纪录
    鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂青年友谊炉，23日在快速炼钢能手李尚忠带领下，只用6点半钟炼出了一炉钢，再一次创造了全国大型平炉快速炼钢的新纪录。这比国家计划炼钢时间缩短了3小时15分钟，钢的质量完全合格。
    李尚忠和炼钢工人们进一步学习了苏联科列斯尼科夫快速炼钢的经验，运用新的炼钢法，在出完钢以后就加矿石和石灰石，然后进行高温快速补炉和快速装料，高温加铁水。全部炼钢操作始终在高温下进行，因而创造了快速炼钢的空前纪录。
    自去年10月8日科列斯尼科夫在青年友谊炉表演快速炼钢以后，李尚忠和乙班炼钢工人们已经连续创造了7小时20分、7小时、6小时40分和6小时半的4次大型平炉快速炼钢的纪录。
