Mr. Chairman, esteemed members, and comrades:

    I have listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports made by the four vice-chairmen, as well as the report on the socialist transformation of Chinese agriculture by Comrade Chen Boda. I wholeheartedly support them.

    I am an industrial and commercial worker, and also the head of a joint state-private industrial enterprise. Today, I would like to share my understanding and experiences from this perspective:

    Premier Zhou's political report states: "The problem now facing the people of the whole country is to do all construction work more, faster, better, and more economically, so that the development of all undertakings can adapt to the changed situation and meet the needs of the country and the people." This is entirely correct, and it must be done in order to improve quality, reduce costs, practice strict economy, and ensure the over-fulfillment and early completion of the First Five-Year Plan, thereby accelerating socialist construction. Today's industry serves the cause of socialist construction, and currently, it is even more urgently serving agriculture. Whether it be agricultural implements, fertilizers, drought prevention, or medical treatment, all are related to industry. With the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, even more industrial support is needed. However, taking just agricultural implements as an example, the output of double-wheeled, double-shared plows is already felt to be lagging behind the needs of agricultural development. That is to say, the situation of social development has fundamentally changed, and if industry does not urgently catch up, it will not be able to adapt to the needs of the country and the people.

    Since the task of industry is so arduous and important, intellectuals need to apply science and technology to increase new strength. Science and technology are the new forces of industry, and intellectuals are the vital forces of socialist construction. In order to develop industrial production under the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, it is necessary to mobilize and utilize the strength of intellectuals. On the one hand, it is necessary to accelerate the cause of socialist construction, and on the other hand, it is necessary to accelerate the change of the backward state of science and technology in our country, catch up with the advanced level of the world, and highly develop our socialist industrialization. It is undeniable that factories have not paid enough attention to science and technology in the past, mistakenly believing that theory is not combined with practice, and book knowledge is not as good as workshop experience. Factories adopted an attitude of respect and distance towards intellectuals, and intellectuals also felt alienated and polite towards factories, with little direct instruction and not much criticism behind their backs. A separation formed between factories and intellectuals, and factories found it difficult to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, strengthening the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals is urgently needed today.

    Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo, in his report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of socialist revolution, pointed out that intellectuals might as well learn from the example of Confucius's great disciple Zeng Shen, and constantly reflect on themselves every day regarding three issues: service, contribution, and learning. I think that industrialists and merchants who have already stepped into the socialist threshold or are striving to advance towards socialism might as well use Zeng Shen's example to reflect on themselves, and they can also reflect on the following three questions:

    1. In the work of asset verification, the government trusts us, allowing us to fill out and report ourselves. Have we been realistic and pragmatic, ensuring that we do not overestimate, underestimate, emphasize the unimportant, or miss any points?

    2. In terms of personnel arrangements (I come from Kunming, taking Kunming as an example), it can be said that the government has tried its best to make appropriate arrangements, achieving appropriate employment and ensuring everyone is in the right place. In our respective jobs, have we been dutiful and responsible, contributing all our strength without reservation and without hesitation?

    3. After public-private joint ownership, enterprises and individuals began further transformation. Can individual transformation keep up with enterprise transformation?

    I am an industrial and commercial worker from Yunnan Province. In the current high tide of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, please allow me to introduce the situation of the socialist transformation of industry and commerce in Kunming City. The day before I came to Beijing (January 21st), I excitedly and happily participated in two celebration meetings within 12 hours, celebrating the complete public-private joint ownership of 15 commercial trades and 20 industrial trades. In the high tide of socialist transformation, I also happily saw off many advanced and active elements from the industrial and commercial circles, who took on new positions in specialized companies and joint ventures, gloriously assuming important positions and becoming state cadres. I have been working in industry and commerce for nearly 6 years, and this is the first major happy event with historical significance that I have participated in in 6 years.

    As the head of a joint state-private industrial enterprise, I will continue to engage in systematic learning, improve my ideological understanding through studying theory, further transform myself through raising awareness, and transform from an exploiter into a laborer. I will muster my youthful courage, contribute the strength of my remaining years, and strive for the socialist transformation work and the socialist construction cause under the wise leadership of the Party and the government.

    Finally, I respectfully wish the conference a successful conclusion, and wish all members and comrades good health.

    孙孟刚的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    会议听取了周恩来主席的政治报告和四位副主席所作的各个报告，以及陈伯达委员所作的中国农业的社会主义改造的报告。我衷心地拥护。
    我是一个工商工作者，也是一个公私合营工业企业的负责人。今天我从这个角度来谈谈我的认识和体会：
    周主席的政治报告中说：“现在，摆在全国人民面前的问题，是要把各项建设事业做得又多、又快、又好、又省，以便使各项事业的发展，适应已经变化了的情况，适应国家和人民的需要。”这是完全正确的，也必须这样做，才能提高质量、降低成本、厉行节约，才能保证超额完成和提前完成第一个五年计划，加速社会主义建设。今天的工业，是为社会主义建设事业服务，当前更迫切的是为农业服务，不论农具、肥料、防旱、治疗等问题，在在与工业有关，随着农业合作化的高潮，更需要工业的支持。但目前仅以农具一项来说，如双轮双铧犁的产量已感觉到跟不上农业发展的需要，那就是说，社会发展情况已经根本变化，工业若不急起直追，迎头赶上，便不能适应国家和人民的需要了。
    当前工业的任务既然这样艰巨重要，更需知识分子应用科学技术来增加新生力量。科学技术是工业的新生力量，知识分子是社会主义建设事业的生力军。为了要在又多、又快、又好、又省的要求下发展工业生产，动员和发挥知识分子的力量是必要的。一方面要加速社会主义建设事业，一方面要加速改变我国科学技术的落后状态，赶上世界的先进水平，高度发展我国社会主义工业化。无容讳言，过去工厂对科学技术是不够重视的，错误地认为理论不结合实际，书本知识不如车间经验。工厂对知识分子抱着敬而远之的态度，知识分子对工厂也觉得疏远客气，当面指教少，背后批评也不多。工厂与知识分子形成隔膜，工厂也就不易做出又多、又快、又好、又省的成绩。因此，加强工、农、知识分子的联盟，今日是有迫切需要的。
    郭沫若副主席的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告中指出，知识分子不妨学孔子的大门人曾参的榜样，每天经常把关于服务、贡献、学习等三个问题，反省自己。我想今天已经踏进了社会主义门槛的或正争取向社会主义前进的工商业者，也不妨把曾参的榜样，来反省自己，也可以把下面的三个问题来反省自己：
    一、对清产核资工作，政府信任我们，自填自报，我们有没有实事求是，做到不高估、不低估，不重点、不漏点？
    二、在人事安排方面（我来自昆明，就昆明来说）可以说，政府已尽量适当安排，做到量才任用各得其所了。我们在各自的工作岗位上，有没有做到守职尽责，毫不保留地、毫不吝惜地贡献出我们的一切力量？
    三、公私合营后，企业与个人开始进一步地改造，个人改造能不能跟上企业改造？
    我是云南省的一个工商工作者，在当前资本主义工商业社会主义改造的高潮中，请容许我介绍昆明市工商业社会主义改造的情况。在我来京的前一日（1月21日），我很兴奋很愉快地在12小时内参加了两个庆祝大会，庆祝15个商业行业、20个工业行业全部公私合营。在社会主义改造的高潮中，我也欢送了不少工商界的先进积极分子，走上了专业公司与合营企业的新岗位，光荣地担任了重要职务，成为国家的干部。我兼任工商工作将近6年，这是我在6年中所参加的有历史意义的第一件大喜事。
    我作为一个公私合营工业企业的负责人，今后我当继续进行有系统的学习，从学习理论来提高思想认识，从提高认识来进一步改造自己，由一个剥削者改造成为劳动者。我当鼓起我忘年的勇气，贡献我余生的力量，在党和政府的英明领导下，为社会主义改造工作、为社会主义建设事业而努力奋斗。
    最后，我敬祝大会胜利成功，各位委员、各位同志身体健康。
