Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The People's Bank of China convened a conference of branch heads from the People's Bank and Agricultural Bank of China in all provinces and cities from January 20th to February 4th.

    The conference, based on the new situation of the national economy's upsurge this year, proposed that the main tasks of the bank in 1956 are: to further improve credit settlement work for socialist enterprises, strive to absorb idle social funds, actively support various economic departments to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule or overfulfill it in terms of capital needs, and at the same time strengthen the supervisory role of credit, supervise enterprises to accelerate capital turnover, save capital, reduce costs, and expand accumulation. In supporting agricultural cooperation and agricultural production increase, the national bank will issue a large amount of agricultural loans this year. The actual amount of agricultural loans issued this year will reach 2 billion yuan, which is five times the actual amount issued last year. In addition, credit cooperatives will also issue loans of 500 million yuan. This is a very large number, and banks at all levels must do a good job in lending work under the leadership of the local Party and government so that this fund can be used reasonably and play its greatest role. Regarding credit cooperatives, strive to complete the task of one cooperative per township within this year to meet the needs of the rapid development of agricultural cooperation. In mobilizing idle social funds, strive to mobilize the masses to save surplus funds, and plan to increase urban savings deposits by 400 to 500 million yuan and rural savings deposits by 2 billion yuan this year. In order to facilitate mass deposits and withdrawals, it is planned to add 5,000 savings offices in cities and 15,000 agency offices in enterprises and institutions this year.
    The conference also reviewed the bank's work in 1955, criticized right-leaning conservative thinking in the work, and initially discussed the draft of the long-term plan for the bank's work during the second five-year plan.

    人民银行和农业银行分行行长会议
    确定今年银行主要任务
    新华社9日讯　中国人民银行从1月20日到2月4日召开了全国各省、市人民银行和农业银行的分行行长会议。
    会议根据今年国民经济高涨的新情况，提出1956年银行的主要任务是：进一步改进对社会主义企业的信贷结算工作，努力吸收社会闲散资金，积极支持各经济部门提前或超额完成第一个五年计划对资金的需要，同时加强信贷的监督作用，监督企业加速资金周转，节约资金，降低成本，扩大积累。在支援农业合作化和农业增产方面，今年国家银行将大量发放农业贷款，今年农业贷款的实际发放数将达20亿元，等于去年实际发放数的5倍，此外，信用合作社还要发放贷款5亿元。这个数目很大，各级银行必须在当地党政领导下，把贷放工作做好，使这笔资金能够使用得合理，发挥最大的作用。关于信用合作社，争取在今年内完成每乡一社的任务，以适应农业合作化迅速发展的需要。在动员社会闲散资金方面，努力动员群众把多余资金储蓄起来，计划今年城市储蓄存款增加四至五亿元，农村储蓄存款增加20亿元；为了便利群众存款和取款，今年准备在城市中增设储蓄所5，000个，在企业和机关内增设代办所15，000个。
    这次会议还检查了1955年的银行工作，批判了工作中的右倾保守思想，初步讨论了第二个五年计划期间银行工作的远景规划草案。
