    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

    I fully agree with and endorse the reports of Chairman Zhou Enlai and the Vice-Chairmen. These reports have been very educational for me. On the one hand, I feel boundless excitement and encouragement because, in the near future, our motherland will stand tall in the world as a highly cultured socialist power, and each of us is completing the glorious and great cause that our ancestors did not accomplish. Living in this great era, every patriotic person will feel proud and happy. On the other hand, I also feel very ashamed because, in the high tide of socialism, I have not adequately played the role of a senior intellectual in terms of scientific advancement and the cultivation of new forces. In the future, I should redouble my efforts to fulfill the glorious and great task entrusted to us senior intellectuals by the Party and the people, which is to expand our ranks more than tenfold within 12 years and raise China's science and culture to the advanced level of the world.

    Some comrades have already discussed the problems existing in the work of senior intellectuals and the solutions to these problems. The Party has conducted in-depth investigations and understanding of the situation of senior intellectuals and has decided to take all measures in the future to create favorable conditions for senior intellectuals in their studies and work. I believe that the Party's decisions will definitely be realized and implemented. The remaining question is how intellectuals should strive to create subjective conditions. I fully agree with the direction of struggle for intellectuals in the future pointed out by Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman Zhang Bojun, and other comrades. Those great principles are very familiar to us and easily understood. Today is not the time for us to sit and talk, but to actively put them into practice, to improve our understanding of those theories and to train ourselves in practice, practice, and more practice.

    I am a medical education and scientific research worker. Let me cite a small experience of my own to illustrate that China can improve the quality of science and technology to the world's advanced level within 12 years, or even earlier. During the late period of the Anti-Japanese War, I once organized the work of a blood bank in Kunming and was able to extract dry plasma in the blood bank. The large-scale use of refrigerated blood and dry plasma for medical emergency work was still an advanced technology during World War II. Why could we do it in the late period of the Anti-Japanese War? As Vice-Chairman Guo pointed out, we can send experts directly to foreign countries to study, and then import what we have learned. I went to the United States to study during the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War. In addition to studying the theory of blood transfusion medicine, I also actually apprenticed in the technical operation process in the blood bank. The method of storing blood and extracting dry plasma is a highly sterile operation process with collective division of labor by doctors, nurses, assistants, inspectors, and technicians. Even the cleaning of blood bank utensils has a complete set of regulations. I spent only half a year mastering all the steps from washing all the utensils to drawing blood, storing blood, extracting, drying, testing, and packaging, and meticulously recorded all the operating procedures, without omitting even the brand names, specifications, values, and producing company names of various instruments. After purchasing that batch of instruments in the United States, I was afraid of buying inferior goods from American merchants that could not be used when brought back to China. Therefore, I set up a temporary experimental blood bank there and extracted dry plasma from the blood of overseas Chinese. At that time, overseas Chinese strongly supported the Anti-Japanese War and were willing to donate blood to be sent back to China to rescue wounded and sick soldiers and civilians. At the same time, I personally trained a group of technical personnel who needed to be divided into different tasks in the experimental blood bank, and then returned to Kunming together. In a very short period of time, we established a blood bank and extracted dry plasma. At that time, it was rare even in the United States to produce dry plasma in blood banks. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I made a plan to enrich the equipment of the internal library and change the blood bank into a blood bank research institute to improve blood storage and plasma extraction methods, and to conduct research on blood substitutes. At the same time, I also planned to train a large number of cadres to establish a blood bank network in the country, but it was not adopted by the pseudo-military medical department, so I left in a huff. It is understandable that the reactionary government did not adopt this plan because it never valued the health of soldiers and working people. If there had been the support of the Party and the People's Government at that time, I believe that China would have already surpassed the level of the United States in the equipment of blood transfusion medicine. The fact that China can manufacture various antibiotics in less than 7 years after liberation can illustrate this point. Mastering atomic energy technology is certainly more difficult than mastering blood bank technology, but if we also adopt the method of first going to study, then importing and improving it, it will not take too long. I used to adopt the method of working alone, delving into blood refrigeration and dry plasma extraction by category. If we first establish a study group or investigation team, collectively study the theory, divide the work to master the technology, and then come up with a collective creation, it would be twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, when studying in the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, the experts there must be very active and enthusiastic in their guidance and will not hold back their skills, which will further accelerate the improvement of China's scientific level.

    The quality of some sciences in China can be improved from the aspect of developing the cultural heritage of the motherland, which can be even faster. For example, Western medicine has no specific medicine for the treatment of Japanese encephalitis, while traditional Chinese medicine has a curative effect of more than 90% for this disease. If Western medicine can actively learn from traditional Chinese medicine and scientifically sort out the medical theories of traditional Chinese medicine, it can make China's medicine surpass the level of Europe and the United States. I think there is a similar situation in agriculture.

    To improve the level of science, we should also carry out criticism and self-criticism in academics. Stalin said that without free discussion, without criticism and self-criticism, it is impossible to discover scientific truth.

    Regarding the possibility of increasing the number of scientific research cadres, I agree with Professor Qian Xuesen's view that if an old teacher starts with only one apprentice, he can train 89 apprentices in 12 years. Then 100 old teachers can train 8,900 apprentices in 12 years. We now have more than 1,000 old teachers, so they can train 89,000 in 12 years. Moreover, an old teacher can train several apprentices at the same time after improving the training methods.

    To ask old teachers to improve the scientific level and cultivate new forces, guaranteeing time is indeed a top priority. No matter what you do, the more time you have, the better if you want to do it comprehensively, deeply, and meticulously. Let me take my own experience to illustrate the seriousness of this problem. Before liberation, although the reactionary government did not value research work, and although my research work was carried out under extremely difficult conditions, I could control my own time and there were very few interruptions. Since liberation, I have held more part-time jobs and have to participate in many social activities. The time I squeeze out has to be used to improve teaching reform work. The academic system and the number of students in the medical school have been changing almost every year. After producing a set of teaching materials, I have to revise them again, so that I have not been able to carry out research work very well. I suggest that the central government also have a comprehensive plan in higher medical education. The Science Publishing House wants me to write a special book in 1956 on the problem of sympathetic unconditioned reflex centers in the central nervous system that I have studied. I also want to do a little supplementary experiment based on Pavlov's neurological point of view before writing, which is expected to take 4 months of concentrated time to complete the task. Since the time has not been guaranteed, I am not sure to complete it, because after returning this time, I have to participate in teaching meetings to discuss in-depth teaching reform and comprehensive planning issues. After the teaching meeting, I have to participate in the comprehensive planning and a series of symposiums of the Hunan Provincial Science Popularization Association, Science and Technology Association, Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and democratic parties. I also have to do a good job in the basic tasks of teaching that I am in charge of. At the end of last year, I also made a five-year plan to study the regulation of higher nervous activity on the physicochemical properties and immune effects of blood, and to study the relationship between acupuncture and nervous system activity. The research on these issues has not been in-depth in the Soviet Union either. If we can thoroughly understand the regulation of higher nervous activity on the physicochemical properties of blood, we can not only develop Pavlov's neurological point of view, but also possibly further discover some pathogens of blood diseases that have not yet been found. If we can find out the relationship between acupuncture and the laws of nervous system activity, we can better promote the acupuncture therapy of the motherland. When making this five-year plan, I was also afraid that I would not be able to complete the task on schedule. After listening to the reports here, I believe that under the wise and correct leadership of the Party, under the superior people's democratic dictatorship system, with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and with the trust and support of 600 million people, I not only have the confidence to complete the research plan in the spirit of collective creation, but also have the confidence and determination to work with senior intellectuals to complete the glorious and great political tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people.

    Finally, I wish the conference success and all the committee members and comrades good health!

    易见龙的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来主席及各位副主席的报告，这些报告给我的教育意义是很大的。一方面使我感到无比的兴奋与鼓舞，因为在不久的将来，我们的祖国就会以一个高度文化的社会主义的大国而屹立于世界，而我们每个人都是在完成我们祖先没有做过的光荣伟大的事业。生在这个伟大的时代，每个爱国的人民都会感到骄傲与幸福。在另一方面，我又感到非常惭愧，因为在社会主义高潮中，无论在科学的提高与培养新生力量方面，我都没有很好地发挥一个高级知识分子的作用。今后应当加倍努力来完成党与人民交给我们高级知识分子的光荣伟大的任务，那就是要在12年之内，扩大我们的队伍到十倍以上，并把我国的科学文化提高到世界的先进水平。
    关于高级知识分子在工作中存在的问题与解决的办法，有好些同志已谈过。党对高级知识分子的情况已进行过深入的调查与了解，决定今后采取一切措施替高级知识分子在学习与工作方面创造有利的条件。我相信党的决定是一定能够做到和贯彻的，剩下来的问题就是知识分子应该怎样努力去创造主观的条件。我完全同意郭沫若副主席、章伯钧副主席及其他同志指出的知识分子今后奋斗的方向。那些大道理都是我们很熟悉的，并且容易理解的，今天不是我们坐而言，而是要积极地付诸实践，在实践、实践、再实践中去提高对那些理论的认识，并锻炼自己。
    我是一个医学教育与科学研究工作者，让我举出自己的一个小经验来说明我国可以在12年之内甚至还可以提前把科学技术的质量提高到世界先进的水平。在抗日战争后期，我曾经在昆明主办过血库的工作，并且可以在血库内提制干血浆。大量利用冷藏血液及干血浆来做医疗急救工作，还是第二次世界大战时的先进技术，我们在抗日末期为什么就可以做到呢？正如郭副主席所指示的，我们可以派专家直接到外国去学习，学会了以后再输入。我就是在抗日前期到美国去学习的，除钻研输血医疗的理论外，还实际在血库内见习技术操作过程。储血及提制干血浆的方法，是一个由医师、护士、助理员、检验员及技师等集体分工的高度无菌操作过程，连清洗血库用具都有一套完整的规程。我只用了半年时间，从洗涤一切用具至抽血、储血、提制、干溜、检验及包装等步骤，都亲自动手加以掌握，并详细记录一切操作规程，连各种仪器的品名、规格、价值及出产公司名称都没有遗漏。就在美国采购那批仪器后，还怕买到美国商人的劣货，带回国不能应用，于是又在那边成立临时实验血库，抽华侨的血来提制干血浆。那时华侨是极拥护抗日战争，愿意捐血送回国内救护伤病兵民。同时我又亲自在实验血库内训练一批需要分工的技术人员，然后一同回到昆明，在很短的时期就成立了血库并提制了干血浆。那时候，就是在美国，在血库内兼制干血浆还是不多见的。抗战胜利以后，我作过一个充实内库的设备并改血库为血库研究所的计划，去改进储血及血浆提制法，并进行代血品的研究，同时也计划培养一大批干部在国内建立血库网，但未被伪军医署所采纳，我因此就拂袖而去。反动政府不采纳这个计划是可以理解的，因为它从来就不曾重视过士兵及劳动人民的健康。如果那时就有党和人民政府的支持，我相信我国在输血医疗的配备方面，早已超过了美国的水平。解放以后不到7年，我国就可以制造各种抗生素就可以说明这一点。要掌握原子能的技术当然比掌握血库的技术要难些，但是如果也采取先去学习，再输入而加以提高，也不会需要太长的时间。我从前是采取单干的方法，分门别类去钻研血液冷藏及干血浆提制的，如果先成立一个学习组或考察团，集体钻研理论后，分工去掌握技术，然后再来一个集体创作，那就会事半而功倍。何况到苏联及新民主主义国家去学习的时候，那里的专家一定是很积极的、热情的指导，不会有留一手的作风，那就会更加速我国科学水平的提高。
    在国内有些科学的质量是可以从发扬祖国文化遗产方面去提高的，那就可以更来得迅速。例如西医对乙型脑炎的治疗是没有特效药的，而中医对这种病的疗效就在90％以上。如果西医能积极地向中医学习，对中医的医疗理论加以科学整理，就可以使我国医学超过欧美的水平。在农业方面，我想也有同样的情形。
    要提高科学的水平还应当在学术上展开批评与自我批评。斯大林说过，没有自由讨论，没有批评与自我批评就不可能发现科学的真理。
    关于科学研究干部在数量上提高的可能，我同意钱学森教授的看法，如果一个老教师只从带一个徒弟开始，12年内就可以带出89个徒弟，那末100个老教师在12年内就可以带出8，900个徒弟。我们现在已有1，000多个老教师，那末12年内就可以带出89，000个，何况一个老教师在改进培养的方法以后是可以同时多带几个徒弟的。
    要老教师来提高科学水平并培养新生力量，时间的保证的确是一个头等重要的问题，无论做什么事，要做得全面深入细致的话，时间愈多愈好。让我再拿切身的经验来说明这个问题的严重性。解放以前，虽则反动政府不重视研究工作，虽则我的研究工作是在极困难的条件之下进行，但是我自己可以支配自己的时间，从来是很少间断的。自从解放以后，兼职比较多，又要参加好些社会活动，挤出来的时间还得搞好教学改革工作，医学院的学制与学生人数几乎是年年在改变，搞出一套教材以后又要重行改编，以致还没有很好地展开研究工作。我建议中央在高等医学教育方面也应当有一个全面规划。科学出版社要我在1956年就我研究过的中枢神经系统内交感性非条件反射中枢的问题写一个专册，我还想根据巴甫洛夫的神经论观点做一点补充实验以后再写，预计需要集中4个月的时间才可以完成任务，由于时间还没有保证，我就没有把握去完成，因为这次回去后，要参加教学会议讨论深入教学改革及全面规划问题，教学会议以后还得参加湖南省的科普、科联、省政协及民主党派的全面规划及一系列的座谈会，也得搞好我自己主持的长沙生理科学分会的全面规划，同时还得搞好教学的基本任务。去年底我也做过五年研究高级神经活动对血液理化性质及免疫作用的调节，并研究针灸与神经系统活动的关系。关于这些问题的研究，在苏联也还没有深入。如果我们能透彻了解高级神经活动对血液理化性质的调节，不仅可以发展巴甫洛夫的神经论观点，或许也可能进一步发现现在还没有找到的一些血液病的病原。如果我们能够找出针灸与神经系统活动规律的关系，我们就可以更好发扬祖国的针灸疗法。在作这个五年计划的时候，我还恐怕不能如期完成任务。来这里听过报告以后，我相信在党的英明正确领导之下，在优越的人民民主专政制度之下，在苏联与新民主主义国家的援助之下，在6亿人民的信任与支持之下，我不仅有信心用集体创作的精神去完成研究计划，也有信心与决心和高级知识分子一道来完成党与人民交给我们的光荣伟大的政治任务。
    最后，祝大会胜利及各位委员与同志们健康！
