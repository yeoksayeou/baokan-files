    Production Management Experience of Baiquan County Agricultural Cooperatives
    Feng Chun, Meng Xianwu
    The land of agricultural production cooperatives was originally managed by individual households, with scattered plots, inconsistent furrows, and uneven row ends. After these plots were unified under the management of agricultural cooperatives, they created many difficulties for the cooperative's leadership. Initially, the leaders of agricultural cooperatives lacked experience in leading collective production and were not highly educated. They found it difficult to remember these scattered plots and complex furrows. Many cooperative leaders were not familiar with how much land the cooperative had, how many plots it was divided into, what kind of furrows they were, and what crops should be planted on each plot. As a result, they were unsure about the allocation of labor and animal power, and their production plans were not specific. Because the cooperative's leaders were unsure about how to lead production, they relied on ad hoc arrangements, and the responsibility system was unclear. Some cooperatives experienced problems such as planting in the wrong fields, harvesting the wrong crops, delivering the wrong fertilizer, and missing hoeing or weeding. Some cooperatives failed to adjust the furrows of small plots to gradually merge them into unified furrows over the years, resulting in reduced production due to repeated plowing and encountering furrows head-on. If these problems cannot be resolved in a timely manner, they will hinder the rapid development of agricultural cooperatives' production.
    In order to solve the above problems, in the spring of 1954, the Baiquan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Heilongjiang Province, dispatched a work team to study the production management method centered on land planning in the First Cooperative of Ligong Village, Labor District, and piloted it in key cooperatives throughout the county. In 1955, it was widely promoted in agricultural cooperatives throughout the county. The specific content of land planning is to first conduct a survey and registration of each household and each plot based on the distribution of land within the cooperative. Then, the plot number, location, type of furrow, number of rows, and area are recorded on a chart to facilitate planned land consolidation.
    After the survey and registration, the planting plan for each plot and the summer hoeing, weeding, and autumn harvest production plan are comprehensively arranged according to the requirements of the national plan and the different furrows of the cultivated land. This strengthens the planning of the cooperative and changes the blindness in leadership work. At the same time, it can both adjust the furrows according to the national plan and expand the planting of high-yield and stable-yield crops, so that the land gradually becomes contiguous.
    On the basis of land planning, the land of the whole cooperative is divided into several cultivated areas, and labor organization is improved, teams and groups are rationally divided, animal power and farm implements are properly allocated, and a "three-contract" (contract for cultivation, contract for work, contract for yield) and "four-fixed" (fixed labor, animal power, farm implements, and land) production responsibility system is implemented to improve operation and management. There are three specific forms: The first is the annual "three-contract" and "four-fixed" production management method. For example, in the First Cooperative of Fusheng Village, Fuqiang District, the cooperative's 330 hectares of cultivated land were divided into three operating areas. According to the quality of each plot of land, operating conditions, and technical measures, a contract for work and yield was implemented for each crop, with rewards for exceeding the yield (40% of the excess part was distributed to the contracting team according to labor days). The cooperative's 108 male and female laborers (37 females) were divided into three production teams according to their strength, technical specialties, and core members, and animal power and farm implements were allocated and fixed for each production team to use and manage. The second is the seasonal contract for work and "four-fixed" production management method. The third is the short-term "four-fixed" management method.
    The implementation of land planning is as follows: In 1955, 786 of the 896 old cooperatives in Baiquan County carried out land planning, formulated charts, and implemented the "four-fixed" system on the basis of land planning. The facts of the past two years have proved that all agricultural cooperatives that have earnestly implemented the production management method centered on land planning have achieved good results:
    First, the rational utilization of land has been realized. Due to the implementation of land planting planning, on the one hand, the land has been rationally and systematically utilized, and the potential of the land has been brought into play, avoiding the artificial reduction in production caused by blindly consolidating plots without considering the furrows; on the other hand, the requirements of the national plan have also been realized. Ninety percent of the cooperatives in the county have expanded their plans for high-yield and stable-yield crops.
    Second, operation and management have been improved, the responsibility system has been strengthened, the enthusiasm of cooperative members for labor has been generally improved, and the phenomena of work stoppages and absenteeism have been eliminated. According to statistics, cooperatives with about 25 households and 30 laborers can save 700 to 1,200 labor days a year, and they can complete production plans ahead of schedule.

    拜泉县农业合作社的生产管理经验
    酆春　孟宪武
    农业生产合作社的土地原来是一家一户分散经营的，地块零星，槎口不一，垅头大小不齐。这些地块由农业合作社统一经营以后，给社的领导人员造成了很多困难，农业合作社的领导人员开头都缺乏领导集体生产的经验，文化程度也不高。他们对这样零星的地块，复杂的槎口，也不容易记清楚。不少社的领导人员对全社有多少土地，分多少块，是什么槎口，哪块地应当种什么，都不熟悉，这样，他们对劳力、畜力的分配就心中无数，生产计划也就订不具体。由于社里领导人员对领导生产心中无数，干活临时现抓，责任制度不清，有些社就发生了种错地、捞错地、送错粪、漏铲漏?等现象。有些社因为没有把小块地的槎口调好，使之逐年联成统一槎口，以致种地重槎、迎槎而造成减产。这些问题如果不能及时解决，就会妨碍农业合作社的生产的迅速发展。
    为了解决上述问题，1954年春，中共黑龙江省拜泉县委派工作组在劳动区立功村第一社研究了以土地规划为中心的生产管理办法，并且在全县重点社中试行；1955年又普遍在全县农业合作社中推广。土地规划的具体内容首先是根据本社土地的分布情况，逐户、逐块进行调查登记，然后在图表上记清地号、耕地坐落、什么槎口、多少垅、多大面积等，以便有计划地进行土地联片经营。
    在调查登记之后，就根据国家计划要求和耕地的不同槎口，全面安排每块土地的播种计划和夏锄铲?、秋收生产计划，这样就加强了合作社的计划性。改变了领导工作方面的盲目性。同时既能根据国家计划调好槎口，又能扩大高产、稳产作物，使土地逐渐连片。
    在土地规划的基础上，把全社土地分为若干耕作区，并且搞好劳动组织，合理分队分组，调配好畜力和农具，实行“三包”（包耕、包工、包产）和“四固定”（固定劳动、畜力、农具、土地）的生产责任制，改善经营管理。具体形式有三种：第一种是常年“三包”和“四固定”的生产管理办法。如富强区福胜村第一社，全社330垧耕地，划分了三个作业区，按每块土地质量，经营条件，技术措施，对每种作物实行了包工包产，超产奖励（超产部分的40％归包耕队按劳动日分）。全社男女劳力108名（女37名）根据劳动力强弱，技术特长，骨干力量、适当配开，划分了三个生产队，畜力、农具根据强弱、好坏配齐，固定给各生产队使用、保管。第二种是季节包工和“四固定”的生产管理办法。第三种是短期“四固定”的管理办法。
    推广土地规划的情况是：1955年拜泉县896个老社中有786个社进行了土地规划，制定了图表，并且在土地规划的基础上实行了“四固定”。两年来的事实证明，凡是认真贯彻执行以土地规划为中心的生产管理办法的农业合作社，都收到了良好效果：
    第一、实现了合理利用土地。由于进行了土地播种规划，一方面合理地有计划地利用了土地，发挥了土地潜力，避免了因不对槎口盲目联片种植而造成人为的减产损失；另一方面也实现了国家计划的要求；全县90％的合作社扩大了高产、稳产作物的计划。
    第二、改善了经营管理，健全了责任制，普遍提高了社员的劳动积极性，消除了窝工旷工现象。据统计，25户、30个劳力左右的合作社，一年可少浪费700到1，200个劳动日，并且能够提前完成生产计划。
