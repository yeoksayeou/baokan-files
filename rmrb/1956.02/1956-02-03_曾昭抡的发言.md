    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    In recent days, a high tide of socialist transformation and socialist construction has been sweeping across the country. All tasks are advancing on the great socialist road with unprecedented speed, magnificent scale, and healthy steps. The people of the whole country are jubilantly and warmly celebrating the great victory of entering socialism. Facing the new situation of the high tide of the socialist revolution, all senior intellectuals, like the people of the whole country, feel extremely excited and are willing to respond to Chairman Mao's call, to devote all their strength to striving to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level as soon as possible, and to strive for the early arrival of a high tide in China's science, culture, and education.
    Since the liberation of the whole country, senior intellectuals in universities and colleges, with the education and help of the Party, have worked diligently, studied assiduously, and strived to learn political theory and advanced Soviet experience. They have made considerable progress in their political thinking and have also gradually improved the quality of teaching and academic level, making certain contributions to the cause of socialist construction. However, on the other hand, due to the busy work of rectification and reform in higher education in the early days of liberation, the system was not sound enough, and the understanding of the central government's policy on intellectuals was not deep enough, there are still some phenomena such as inappropriate arrangements, excessive concurrent jobs and social activities, and imperfect working conditions, which prevent some intellectuals from fully exerting their role and potential.
    After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the meeting on the issue of intellectuals, it gave brilliant instructions on the policy towards intellectuals, so that all the unreasonable phenomena in the past can be swept away. In this way, senior intellectuals in universities and colleges can better exert their greatest role, and make greater contributions to the victorious completion of the task of training cadres, vigorously carrying out scientific research, and catching up with the world's advanced science and technology.
    In order to implement the central government's policy on intellectuals, I have a few immature opinions for reference:
    1. With the accelerated development of the country's socialist construction, the tasks of scientific research and cadre training will be very important in the future, and the relationship between these two tasks is very close. In order to more rationally use China's limited number of scholars with expertise, it is recommended to consider making unified arrangements for well-known domestic scholars (who can lead graduate students to complete associate doctoral and doctoral dissertations) nationwide according to disciplines, so that each of them can best exert their expertise, and their wishes can be better combined with the needs of national construction. Through such arrangements, the Chinese Academy of Sciences can be strengthened, and the cause of science and education can be taken into account as a whole, so that the work of scientific research and cadre training can be more closely linked. In carrying out this arrangement, I think it is necessary to carry out a resolute struggle against departmentalism.
    2. Reduce the concurrent jobs and excessive social activities of senior intellectuals as much as possible, so that they can concentrate their main energy and time on professional work. Senior intellectuals should participate in necessary social and political activities, and many of them have to assume certain concurrent jobs, which are needed for national construction, political and international cultural activities, and are also beneficial to improving their political and ideological level and helping them to connect with reality. However, if there are too many concurrent jobs or too many social activities, which affect their basic tasks, it will be detrimental to the cause of national construction and to the development of their own knowledge. Therefore, I think there should be unified arrangements and control for the concurrent jobs and social activities of senior intellectuals, and they should be gradually adjusted on a voluntary basis. If it is necessary to hold a concurrent job, attention should also be paid to using their strengths and equipping them with appropriate assistants to reduce their unnecessary administrative affairs. General banquets, receptions and other social activities can be shared in rotation according to the situation, so as not to be concentrated on a few people. However, if the concurrent positions are combined with each other in terms of work nature, there is no need to add more restrictions, and appropriate encouragement can be given when necessary, such as university teachers concurrently serving as research work at the Academy of Sciences, or scientific researchers and engineers concurrently serving as university teachers.
    3. Pay attention to improving work efficiency, streamline meetings, and save time. At present, the problem of insufficient time in universities and colleges is sharply reflected due to the increasing burden of teaching tasks and the gradual development of scientific research work. In particular, some progressive and socially well-known university professors generally reflect that they do not have enough time to prepare lessons and conduct scientific research. There are many meetings, many concurrent jobs, and many social activities in peacetime, so that the time for normal business work is often squeezed out. In addition to freeing up some time after solving the above-mentioned problems of excessive concurrent jobs and social activities, relevant units should also save the time of teachers and scientists from improving work methods and systems, improving work efficiency, streamlining unnecessary meetings, and avoiding multi-headed deployment of work, and ensure that they can have several whole periods (one day or half a day at a time) each week to concentrate on professional work. On the other hand, we comrades engaged in higher education and scientific research should also continuously improve our ideological level and improve our work methods through study and practice, so as to complete more tasks in less time.
    I warmly support Premier Zhou's political report at this conference, and fully agree with the reports made by Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong. I believe that senior intellectuals across the country will definitely be greatly encouraged by the entire new situation, greatly increase their enthusiasm for socialist construction, criticize their own conservative ideas, continue to study Marxism-Leninism theory hard under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, humbly learn from the advanced scientific achievements of various countries, especially the Soviet Union, work hard, study diligently, and gradually transform themselves into completely socialist intellectuals, and contribute their strength to the great and brilliant socialist construction cause of the motherland!

    曾昭抡的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    这些日子，全国各地都掀起了社会主义改造和社会主义建设的高潮，各项工作都以空前的速度、壮阔的规模和健康的步伐在社会主义大道上迈进。全国人民都在欢欣鼓舞地热烈庆祝进入社会主义的伟大胜利。所有高级知识分子面对着社会主义革命高潮的新形势，也和全国人民一样感到无比的兴奋，愿意响应毛主席的号召，竭尽自己的力量，为迅速赶上世界科学先进水平而奋斗，争取我国科学、文化、教育事业高潮的早日到来。
    全国解放以来，高等学校里的高级知识分子，在党的教育和帮助下，辛勤工作、刻苦钻研、努力学习政治理论和苏联先进经验，在政治思想上有了不少进步，同时也逐步提高了教学质量和学术水平，为社会主义建设事业作出了一定的贡献。但另一方面，由于解放初期高等教育工作忙于进行整顿改革，一切制度不够健全，加以对中央关于知识分子的政策体会不深，以致一般还存在有些安排使用不当、兼职及社会活动过多、工作条件不尽完善等现象，使一部分知识分子不能充分发挥他们的作用和潜力。
    这次中共中央召开关于知识分子问题的会议以后，对知识分子政策作了英明的指示，使过去一切不合理的现象可以一扫而空。这样，高等学校中的高级知识分子就可以更好地发挥自己最大的作用，为胜利完成培养干部任务、大力开展科学研究工作、迎头赶上世界先进科学技术水平作出更大的贡献。
    为了贯彻中央关于知识分子的方针，个人有几点不成熟的意见，提供参考：
    一、随着国家社会主义建设事业的加速发展，今后科学研究和培养干部的任务都很重大，这两方面任务的相互关系又是非常密切。为了更加合理地使用我国为数有限的学有专长的学者，建议考虑将国内的知名学者（能领导研究生完成副博士和博士论文的），按学科在全国范围内作统一安排，使他们中间的每个人都能最好地发挥自己的专长，使他们的志愿能和国家建设的需要更好地结合起来。通过这样的安排，可以加强中国科学院，同时也可以使科学和教育事业得到统筹兼顾，使科学研究与培养干部的工作更加紧密地联系起来。在进行这种安排时，我认为必须与本位主义进行坚决的斗争。
    二、尽可能减少高级知识分子的兼职和过多的社会活动，以便使他们有可能集中主要精力和时间来从事专业工作。高级知识分子应当参加必要的社会政治活动，他们中间还有许多不得不担负一定的兼职，这是国家建设事业和政治、国际文化等活动所需要，同时对于提高他们的政治思想水平、帮助联系实际等都是有好处的。但是如果兼职过多或参加过多的社会活动，影响了本身的基本任务，则对国家建设事业以及对他们本身学问的发展都是不利的。因此我认为对于高级知识分子的兼职和社会活动，应有统一的安排和掌握，在自愿基础上逐步调整。如果必须兼职，也应注意使用其所长，并配备适当的助手，减少他们不必要的行政事务。一般的宴会、迎送等社会交际活动，可以分别情况轮流分担，不致集中在少数人的身上。但如所兼职务在工作性质上是互相结合的，则可不必多加限制，必要时还可适当鼓励，如高等学校教师兼任科学院的研究工作或科学研究人员和工程师兼任高等学校教师等。
    三、注意提高工作效率，精简会议，节约时间。当前高等学校中由于教学任务日益繁重、科学研究工作逐步展开，时间不够的问题很尖锐地反映出来。特别是一部分进步的、社会知名的大学教授，普遍反映没有足够的时间进行备课及科学研究工作，平时会议多、兼职多、社会活动多，以致往往把正常业务工作的时间给挤掉了。除了解决上述兼职和社会活动过多问题以后可以腾出一部分时间以外，有关单位也要从改进工作方法和工作制度、提高工作效率、精简不必要的会议、避免多头布置工作等方面来节约教师、科学家的时间，保证他们每周能有几个整段（一次一天或半天）的时间集中力量来从事专业工作。另一方面，我们这些从事高等教育和科学研究工作的同志们也应当通过学习和实践，不断提高自己的思想水平，改进自己的工作方法，以求在较少的时间内完成更多的任务。
    我热烈地拥护周总理在这次大会上所作的政治报告，完全同意董必武副主席、李济深副主席、郭沫若副主席、陈叔通副主席所作的报告，我相信全国高级知识分子一定会在整个新形势的鼓舞下，大大提高自己从事社会主义建设的热情，批判自己的保守思想，继续在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，努力学习马克思列宁主义理论，虚心学习世界各国、特别是苏联的先进的科学成就，努力工作、刻苦钻研，逐步把自己变成完全社会主义的知识分子，在祖国伟大辉煌的社会主义建设事业中贡献出自己的力量！
