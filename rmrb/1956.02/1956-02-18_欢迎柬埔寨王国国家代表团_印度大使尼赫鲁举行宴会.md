Xinhua News Agency, February 17th—Indian Ambassador to China, R.K. Nehru, hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the distinguished guests of the Government of the People's Republic of China – His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and his delegation from the Kingdom of Cambodia.

His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and members of the National Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia attended the banquet upon invitation.

Also present at the banquet were Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Marshal Ye Jianying, Cheng Qian, and Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun and Bao Erhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, as well as heads of relevant departments of state organs and people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and representatives from religious circles in Beijing.

Heads of diplomatic missions and diplomatic officials of various countries in China also attended the banquet upon invitation.

At the banquet, Ambassador R.K. Nehru and Prince Sihanouk delivered speeches respectively, which were warmly welcomed.

In his speech, Ambassador R.K. Nehru first talked about Prince Sihanouk's visit to India a year ago. He said: Maintaining a peaceful international environment is a necessary condition for the development of any country. During your visit to India, Your Highness and Prime Minister Nehru discussed this issue. You issued a joint declaration. The declaration stated that you and Prime Minister Nehru agreed that the best guarantee of peace and friendship between countries is to adhere to the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, independence and integrity; non-aggression; equality and mutual respect; and non-interference in internal affairs.

The joint declaration also emphasized the need to create conditions for peaceful coexistence, for the full implementation of the Geneva Accords, and for maintaining and consolidating the independence of Cambodia. As Your Highness often points out, Cambodia's policy is to adhere to peace, neutrality without joining any blocs, and a policy of equal friendship with all countries.

R.K. Nehru said: Shortly after his visit to India, His Highness led a delegation to the Bandung Conference. At this unforgettable gathering of Asian and African countries, the Cambodian delegation played a prominent role. The result of the meeting was the issuance of a declaration, which in many ways marked a turning point in history.

Asian and African countries have played an active leading role in eliminating international tensions, promoting freedom and human rights, and maintaining and strengthening peace. The purpose of this leading role is not to oppose any country or group of countries, but to bring countries closer to each other and promote friendship and cooperation on the basis of freedom, equality, and mutual benefit. On this basis, friendly understanding and cooperation between Cambodia and other Asian countries are steadily developing.

R.K. Nehru concluded by saying: Your Highness and members of the National Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia are now visiting our great sister country - China. This visit is reminiscent of the friendly cooperation that took place in Bandung between representatives of our three countries and many other countries. We sincerely hope that this visit will in all respects help to strengthen the great purposes that Asian and African countries have agreed to strive for in the interest of world peace.

In his speech, Prince Sihanouk, when speaking about the relationship between India and Cambodia, said: It is not surprising that after experiencing the same misfortunes, and regaining their national independence in similar circumstances within a period of less than 10 years, the people of our two countries have enabled their governments to adopt the same policies.

He said: So far, this policy has given our country and our people an enviable position in Indochina: it has enabled us to solve all our problems (unity, elections and peace).

Sihanouk said that Cambodia can count on a great friend, Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, in any circumstances. He added that I must emphasize the outstanding contribution made by Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, together with my distinguished host and friend Premier Zhou Enlai, to the success of the Bandung Conference, that is, to the victory of the principles of freedom of all peoples and international peace.

Sihanouk concluded by saying, with pleasant memories of the friendship that arose in Bandung between Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru, Mr. Zhou Enlai and myself, please allow me to propose a toast to the friendship between India, China and Cambodia!

Then, Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass and said that India, Cambodia, and China have a common belief: to guide our relations according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. These Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are increasingly agreed upon and accepted by many countries. He proposed a toast to the development of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to the development of the friendly relations between India, Cambodia, and China, to the common cause of the three countries in defending Asian and world peace, and to the good health of His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk!

During the banquet, the guests repeatedly toasted the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Asia and the world, and to peace in Asia and the world.

During the banquet, the orchestra specially played several pieces composed by Prince Sihanouk, which were warmly welcomed.

The banquet proceeded in a friendly atmosphere.

    欢迎柬埔寨王国国家代表团
    印度大使尼赫鲁举行宴会
    新华社17日讯　印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁在今天晚上举行宴会，欢迎中华人民共和国政府的贵宾——柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下和他所率领的柬埔寨王国国家代表团。
    西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国国家代表团团员都应邀出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的，还有中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来、副总理陈毅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、彭真、陈叔通，国防委员会副主席叶剑英元帅、程潜、傅作义，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧、鲍尔汉，外交部副部长章汉夫，以及国家机关各有关部门和人民团体的负责人，中国人民解放军的高级将领，北京宗教界人士等。
    各国驻华使节和外交官员也应邀出席了宴会。
    宴会上，拉·库·尼赫鲁大使和西哈努克亲王先后讲了话，他们的讲话受到了热烈欢迎。
    拉·库·尼赫鲁大使在讲话中首先谈到了西哈努克亲王在一年以前访问印度的情形。他说：维持一个和平的国际环境对任何国家的发展来说都是一个必要的条件。在你访问印度的时候，殿下和尼赫鲁总理都谈到过这个问题。你们发表了一项联合宣言。宣言中说你和尼赫鲁总理一致认为：各国之间和平和友谊的最好的保证，就是遵守互相尊重主权、独立和完整；互不侵犯；平等和互相尊重；以及互不干涉内政等原则。
    联合宣言也强调了有需要为和平共存，为日内瓦协议的充分实施，以及为维护和巩固柬埔寨的独立而创造条件。正如殿下时常指出的，柬埔寨的政策是忠于和平，中立而不参加任何集团，以及对一切国家同样友好的政策。
    拉·库·尼赫鲁说：殿下在访问印度后不久，就率领代表团参加了万隆会议。在这个难忘的亚非国家的集会中，柬埔寨代表团起了卓越的作用。会议的结果是发表了一项宣言，从很多方面看来，这项宣言标志了历史中的一个转折点。
    亚非国家在消除国际紧张局势、促进自由和人权以及维护和加强和平等方面，起了积极的带头作用。这种带头作用的目的并不是要反对任何国家或国家集团，而是要使各国彼此之间更加接近，并在自由、平等和互利的基础上促进友好和合作。在这个基础上，柬埔寨同亚洲其他国家之间的友好了解和合作正在稳步发展。
    拉·库·尼赫鲁最后说：殿下和柬埔寨王国国家代表团团员们现在前来访问我们伟大的姊妹国家——中国。这次访问使人回想起在万隆我们三国的代表和其他许多国家的代表之间所进行的友好合作。我们真诚地希望，这次访问在各方面都能有助于加强亚非各国为了世界和平的利益而同意为之尽力的那些伟大的目的。
    西哈努克亲王在讲话中谈到印度和柬埔寨的关系的时候说：当我们两国人民在经历了相同的厄运，又在相隔不到10年的期间先后在相同的情况下重新获得他们的民族独立之后，使他们的政府采取了相同的政策，这是不足为奇的。
    他说：迄今为止，这一政策使我国和我国人民在印度支那得到一个值得称羡的地位：它使我们得以解决我们的一切问题（统一、选举与和平）。
    西哈努克说，柬埔寨在任何情况下都可以指望一位伟大的朋友——贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生。他又说，我必须着重指出贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生同我的杰出的主人和朋友周恩来总理一起对万隆会议的成就所作的卓越贡献，也就是对各国人民的自由和国际和平的原则的胜利所作的卓越贡献。
    西哈努克最后说，怀着对贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生、周恩来先生和我本人之间在万隆所产生的友谊的愉快记忆，请容许我提议为印度、中国和柬埔寨之间的友好而干杯！
    接着，周恩来总理举杯致词说，印度、柬埔寨、中国有一个共同的信念：就是根据和平共处的五项原则来指导我们之间的关系。这个和平共处的五项原则，越来越多地为许多国家所同意和接受。他建议为和平共处五项原则的发展、为印度、柬埔寨、中国的友好关系的发展、为三国致力于保卫亚洲和世界和平的共同事业、为西哈努克亲王殿下身体健康干杯！
    席间，宾主不断为亚洲和世界各国人民之间的友好和合作、为亚洲和世界的和平而干杯。
    在宴会进行过程中，乐队特地演奏了西哈努克亲王所作的几支乐曲，受到热烈欢迎。
    宴会在友好的空气中进行。
