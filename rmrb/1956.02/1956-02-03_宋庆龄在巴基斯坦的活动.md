    The ceremony for awarding the degree began at 4 p.m. Faculty members and students of Dhaka University, as well as foreign diplomatic representatives in Dhaka, attended the ceremony.

    Dr. Jenkins, Vice-Chancellor of Dhaka University, read the citation for the conferral of the degree. He praised Soong Ching Ling's achievements in political activities and her contribution to the social welfare of the Chinese people.

    Soong Ching Ling then delivered a speech, saying, "The conferral of an honorary degree on me is, in my opinion, a symbol of your friendship towards my country and people. I accept this degree with deep gratitude."

    Soong Ching Ling then briefly discussed her views on the progress of human history and the development of Chinese history, and spoke about the relationship between national construction and peace. She pointed out that a true nation that works entirely for the benefit of its people does not need war, does not need to rule another country, or launch wars of aggression. She said that the ultimate goal of national construction is not only to lift the country out of its backward state, but also to continue to advance in production, education, and culture, in order to meet the almost unlimited demands of raising our living standards. War is unnecessary, and there is every reason to practice peaceful coexistence.

    Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, February 2nd: The East Pakistan branch of the All Pakistan Women's Association held a reception in Dhaka on the evening of February 1st to entertain Soong Ching Ling.

    Among those who attended the reception were the wife of the Governor-General of Pakistan, Mirza, the wife of the Governor of East Pakistan, Ahmed, the wives of ministers of the East Pakistan government, prominent women from Dhaka, and the wives of foreign diplomatic representatives in Dhaka.
