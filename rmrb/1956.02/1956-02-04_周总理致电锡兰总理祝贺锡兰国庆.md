On the occasion of Ceylon's National Day, I, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, and in my own name, extend congratulations to the government of Ceylon, the people of Ceylon, and Your Excellency.

In the past year, through the convening of the Asian-African Conference, the people of China and Ceylon have strengthened their mutual understanding and connection.
