    Feng Youlan's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I completely agree with and support the reports of the Premier and other leaders.
    From their reports, we can see more clearly that our motherland is entering socialist society at a rapid pace. Things that seemed like distant prospects a few months ago have now become realities before our eyes. Agricultural production collectivization, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, and handicraft cooperatives – wave after wave. And what seems to be coming next is a cultural upsurge.
    Welcoming the cultural upsurge is the main task of intellectuals. Among the existing intellectuals, only a very small number have both high political awareness and professional competence. In terms of quantity, it is far from being a strong force. Therefore, how to consolidate and strengthen the existing ranks is an extremely urgent issue.
    In the reports by the Premier and Dean Guo Moruo on the issue of intellectuals, all aspects of the problem have been deeply analyzed, and clear solutions have been indicated for these problems. I was very excited and very moved after listening.
    In an article I published in the People's Daily half a month ago, I discussed the conditions for giving full play to the potential of intellectuals. What I talked about was mainly objective conditions. The development of the situation will inevitably prepare the most favorable objective conditions for intellectuals to give full play to their potential. This has been clearly indicated in the Premier's report.
    However, objective conditions must be combined with subjective conditions to play a role. In terms of the subjective conditions of intellectuals, there are still many problems. As the Premier pointed out in his report, "Many intellectuals inevitably still have bourgeois viewpoints and styles to varying degrees in their thinking and actions." This is indeed the actual situation. Of course, I personally am also included in these "many people." If those who have these erroneous viewpoints and styles do not change, they will not only be unable to make positive contributions to the cause of socialist construction, but will also become obstacles.
    The transformation of intellectuals depends on their own awakening. However, the Party's leadership, enlightenment, encouragement, and supervision are also necessary. The vast majority of intellectuals are eager to make progress and want the Party to give them more help.
    The Premier's report also mentioned that a few percent of counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements are mixed in the ranks of intellectuals. This is also true. The suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement eliminated some counter-revolutionaries. Bad elements must also be eliminated, and only by eliminating the bad can the good play their initiative even better.
    For the transformation of intellectuals, unity must be combined with struggle. In the past, the leadership had some inadequacies in terms of unity with intellectuals. However, there were also many unnecessary concerns in terms of struggle, and these concerns are completely unnecessary now.
    I would like to repeat a passage I said in the People's Daily. In his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," Chairman Mao said to the right-leaning comrades in rural work: "These comrades still underestimate the leadership power of the Communist Party in the countryside and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for the Communist Party." The leadership power of the Communist Party among intellectuals and the enthusiasm of the vast majority of intellectuals for the Communist Party should also not be underestimated.
    The Premier said in his report: "We must mobilize all the strength of intellectuals to catch up with the world's advanced scientific and cultural level in a not too long period of time. This is a great and glorious combat task for the people of our country, especially the intellectuals." I believe that the vast majority of intellectuals will enthusiastically accept this task.
    The Premier also said: "We hope that the intellectuals of our country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, can adopt the method of self-education and gradually grow into intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve socialism through three interconnected paths: observation and practice of social life, practice of professional work, and study of Marxist-Leninist theory." I am determined to take this call as the goal of my self-transformation and struggle in the three five-year plans.
    I wish the conference a complete success and all the committee members good health.

    冯友兰的发言
    主席、诸位委员：
    我完全同意并且拥护总理和各位首长的报告。
    从他们的报告中，我们更清楚地看出来，我们的祖国，正在以飞快的速度，进入社会主义社会。几个月以前看着好像是远景的东西，现在已成为摆在眼前的现实了。农业生产合作化，私营工商业社会主义改造，手工业合作化，几个高潮，一个接着一个。眼看再要涌来的，就是文化高潮。
    迎接文化高潮是知识分子的主要任务。现有的知识分子，政治觉悟和业务水平都高的，只占极少数。就数量说，也远不是一个强大的队伍。因此，如何整顿和壮大现有的队伍，是一个极其迫切的问题。
    在总理和郭沫若院长关于知识分子问题的报告中，各方面的问题，都得到了深刻的分析，而且对于这些问题，都指示了明确的解决办法。我听了，非常地兴奋，也非常地感动。
    在半个月以前我在人民日报发表了一篇文章，谈到发挥知识分子潜力的条件问题。我所谈到的，主要的是客观条件。形势的发展，必然为知识分子发挥潜力准备好最有利的客观条件。这在总理的报告中，已经明确地指示出来。
    可是，客观条件必须与主观条件相结合，才能发挥作用。就知识分子的主观条件说，问题还是很多的。总理在报告中指出，现在知识分子中间，“许多人在思想和行动方面还不可避免地存在着不同程度的资产阶级观点和作风。”这确是实在的情形。当然我个人也包括在这“许多人”之内。有这些错误的观点和作风的人，如果不改，不但对于社会主义建设事业不能有积极的贡献，而且还成了阻碍。
    知识分子的改造，要靠自己的觉悟。但是党的领导、启发、鼓励和督促，也是必要的。绝大多数的知识分子，都是要求进步的，都要求党能给他们更多的帮助。
    总理报告中还提到在知识分子的队伍中混有百分之几的反革命分子和其他坏分子。这也是真的，肃反运动清除了一些反革命分子。对于坏分子也要进行清除，必须清除了坏的，好的才能更发挥他们的积极性。
    对于知识分子的改造，团结必须与斗争相结合。在过去，领导上对于知识分子，在团结方面，是有一些照顾不到的地方。但是在斗争方面，也有不少不必要的顾虑，这些顾虑在现在是完全用不着的。
    我还要重复我在人民日报上所说过的一段话。毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中，对于在农村工作中右倾的同志们说：“这些同志还对于共产党在农村中的领导力量和广大农民对于共产党的热忱拥护这样一种情况，估计不足”。对于共产党在知识分子中的领导力量和广大知识分子对于共产党的热情拥护这样一种情况，也不可估计不足。
    总理在报告中说：“我们必须动员知识分子的一切力量，在不太长的时间内赶上世界的先进的科学文化水平。这是我国人民首先是知识分子的一个伟大的光荣的战斗的任务。”我相信绝大多数的知识分子都将欢欣鼓舞地接受这个任务。
    总理又说：“我们希望，我国知识分子能够在中国共产党的领导下，采取自我教育的方法，通过社会生活的观察和实践、业务的实践和马克思列宁主义理论的学习这样三个互相联系的途径，逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子。”我决心要以这个号召作为我在三个五年计划中的自我改造的奋斗的目标。
    敬祝大会胜利成功，诸位委员身体健康。
