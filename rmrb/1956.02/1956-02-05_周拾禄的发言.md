Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I wholeheartedly support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and fully agree with and support the reports of the four Vice-Chairmen and Comrade Chen Boda.

I am an agricultural scientist. After reading the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, I felt extremely excited and happy. The proposal of this program is necessary and timely. It points out the direction of socialist agricultural construction and the goals of struggle for the people of the whole country. Its content is appropriate and practical, and it can certainly be completed ahead of schedule and beyond expectations with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. I sincerely support this great program and strive to fulfill the glorious tasks given to us by this program.

I realize that Article 6 of the National Agricultural Development Program is an important one among the forty articles. Starting this year, within 12 years, the average annual grain yield per mu will increase to 400 jin in the area north of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, Bailong River, and Yellow River (Qinghai Province), 500 jin in the area south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River, and 800 jin in the area south of the Huai River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River. I would like to offer some opinions on whether this task can be completed and how to complete it.

Based on last year's bumper harvest, the average annual grain yield per mu nationwide will increase by more than one and a half times in the north and double in the south. At first, it seemed a bit difficult, but after analyzing and studying it from four aspects, it is certain that it can be completed. First, this year the basic completion of semi-socialist agricultural cooperation throughout the country can be achieved, and the basic completion of fully socialist agricultural cooperation can be achieved within 3 years. The good things that individual economies could not do can now be done. Natural disasters such as floods, droughts, diseases, and insect pests can be prevented and controlled with collective strength; rational crop rotation and improved land fertility, and other excellent technical measures can be comprehensively planned and implemented; changing to high-yield crops and replacing them with excellent varieties can be systematically carried out in an all-round way; and fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing can be organized to achieve the goal of increasing fertilizer application. Therefore, it is certain that the unit area yield of crops will be greatly increased in the future. Second, in recent years, a large number of typical examples of large-scale, high-yield, and bumper harvests have emerged everywhere. Many of these advanced bumper harvest experiences have not been well summarized, and some are still limited to small areas and have not been promoted. This is because agricultural scientists have not fulfilled their due responsibilities. We must quickly summarize all kinds of large-scale bumper harvest experiences nationwide and promote them in an all-round way in accordance with local conditions. If we do this this year, and every year, the unit area yield of crops will definitely increase steadily and continuously. Third, industrial and water conservancy support for agricultural production is constantly increasing, and it will inevitably become an important factor in promoting agricultural production. For example, the large-scale manufacturing and supply of double-wheel double-share plows and other new agricultural tools can meet the requirements of improving cultivation techniques; the large-scale supply of pesticides can timely and effectively prevent and control diseases and insect pests; combining national river basin planning, constructing farmland water conservancy projects, reducing flood and drought disasters, and expanding irrigation areas, which provides a strong guarantee for increased agricultural production. Fourth, agricultural scientific research institutions have been gradually established throughout the country and are strengthening scientific research work. Agricultural technology promotion institutions are being added and strengthened. In the future, the role of science and technology in agricultural production will definitely gradually increase. Due to the positive effects of these four aspects, it is entirely possible to increase the average annual grain yield per mu nationwide by one to one and a half times by the time the three five-year plans are completed.

The area south of the Huai River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River is an important area for grain production, mainly rice. I have been working on rice for many years, and I will specifically explain the potential and possibility of increasing production in this area. This vast area has a mild climate, sufficient rainfall, fertile soil, and convenient irrigation, which is suitable for the growth of the high-yield crop rice. For a long time, various cropping systems based on summer rice have been formed, and there is also unlimited potential for increasing production. The cropping systems in this area mainly include the following: (1) Double-cropping rice areas, where rice is planted twice a year, and the winter is fallow or another winter crop is planted, which is mostly implemented in the southern provinces. (2) A three-crop-a-year system where rice is planted in the summer, late autumn crops are planted in the autumn, and wheat or other winter crops are planted in the winter, such as in central Zhejiang, Pudong, Jiangsu, and the Chengdu Plain. (3) A two-crop-a-year system where rice is planted in the summer and wheat or other winter crops are planted in the winter, which is the main cropping system in the Yangtze River and areas north of it. (4) An area where high-yield late-maturing japonica rice is planted once in the summer and green manure is cultivated in the winter to ensure a bumper harvest in one season, such as in Songjiang, Jiangsu. (5) A one-crop-a-year system where early and mid-season indica rice is planted once in the summer, and water is stored for soaking the fields or left fallow, such as in the Lixiahe area of Jiangsu and many terraces in Sichuan, which is used due to water conservancy reasons. In recent years, due to the high enthusiasm of farmers for production, they have been tapping the potential for increasing production, changing cropping systems, and improving cultivation techniques, thus achieving large-scale high-yield and bumper harvests. For example, in the Chaoshan area of Guangdong, the double-cropping rice cultivation technology has been improved, and there have been "thousand-jin townships," "thousand-jin districts," and "thousand-jin counties," with individual yields as high as 2,000 jin per mu or more; in the Yangtze River basin, single-cropping rice has been changed to double-cropping rice, generally increasing the yield by 200 jin or more. In the southern provinces, double-cropping intercropped rice has been changed to double-cropping continuous cropping rice, generally increasing production by 150 jin to 200 jin or more. Whether it is changing from single-cropping to double-cropping or from intercropping to continuous cropping, a yield of 1,000 jin per mu or more is very common; in the Lixiahe area of central Jiangsu, single-cropping waterlogged fields have been changed to two-cropping rice-wheat fields, harvesting one more season, with a single wheat yield of 200 jin, and also increasing the rice yield; more than 200,000 mu of dry land in Jiangsu has been changed to rice fields, with an average increase in grain production of 250 jin per mu; In Wanxian, Sichuan, the introduction of Yinfang japonica rice has increased the unit area yield to 700 jin. These few examples can illustrate that simply by reforming the cropping system of rice, such as changing from single-cropping to double-cropping, from intercropping to continuous cropping, from indica rice to japonica rice, from dry land to rice fields, and from single-cropping waterlogged fields to two-cropping rice-wheat fields, the yield has been greatly increased. In addition, with the improvement of other production technologies and the yield of autumn and winter crops, it is not difficult to increase the annual grain yield per mu to more than 1,000 jin. In other words, it is possible to strive to complete the task of increasing the average annual grain yield per mu in the area south of the Huai River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River to 800 jin ahead of schedule and beyond expectations.

In order to rapidly expand high-yield areas and continuously increase yields, and to transform low-yield areas into high-yield areas and gradually increase yields, agricultural scientists must catch up quickly, strengthen scientific research and popularization of science, and enable science and technology to play a greater role in agricultural production. Senior scientific and technical personnel have particularly important responsibilities, and the requirements for self-remolding should be higher and more urgent. I realize that in order to do a good job in scientific research, we must first overcome three shortcomings: First, resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. I have made serious mistakes in this regard. For example, Jinshan County, Jiangsu Province, has been doing double-cropping rice cultivation experiments for several years, and I have never paid attention to this work, thinking that there is no need to plant double-cropping rice in this area and that the results would not be very good, but it has been successfully trialed last year, with a yield of more than 1,000 jin; the Yanjiang area of Anhui Province wanted to try planting double-cropping rice, and I thought that the hope was not great and did not actively support it, but it has been successfully trialed on a large scale last year. If this kind of right-leaning conservative thinking is not broken, it is impossible to do a good job in scientific research. Second, resolutely overcome the idea of emphasizing theory and neglecting practice, and not paying attention to the production experience of the peasant masses, and we must humbly learn from the peasant masses. Like me, relying solely on a little old knowledge and old experience, without understanding the situation, without combining with reality, and sitting at home to lead agricultural scientific research work or agricultural production work, I am of course lagging behind the development of the situation. Third, resolutely overcome the ideological style of arrogance and complacency. My complacency is very serious. I see my own advantages but not my shortcomings, I see other people's shortcomings but not their advantages, and it is not possible to get good results from subjectively and one-sidedly dealing with problems and doing scientific work with unscientific methods. For example, regarding veteran revolutionary cadres, I only see the aspect that their cultural and scientific level is not high, but I do not see the aspect that their political and ideological level is high, and I cannot humbly learn from them to improve my work. This is a great enemy of scientific work and must be overcome with effort.

Finally, I firmly declare that in order to welcome the upsurge of agricultural cooperation and the resulting upsurge of agricultural production, I will definitely strive to study Marxism-Leninism, strengthen self-remolding, improve my political and ideological level, do a good job in agricultural scientific research, complete the glorious tasks given to us by the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule and beyond expectations, and strive to promote China's science and technology to quickly reach the international advanced level.

    周拾禄的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，完全同意并拥护四位副主席和陈伯达委员的报告。
    我是一个农业科学工作者，读了中共中央政治局提出的全国农业发展纲要（草案），感到无比的兴奋和愉快。这个纲要的提出是必要的、适时的，它指出了社会主义农业建设的方向和全国人民的奋斗目标，它的内容是确当的，切合实际的，在全国人民共同努力下，一定可以提前超额完成的。我竭诚拥护这一伟大的纲要，并为完成这一纲要给予我们的光荣任务而努力奋斗。
    我体会到全国农业发展纲要的第六条是四十条里面重要的一条。从今年开始，12年内，粮食每亩平均年产量，在黄河、秦岭、白龙江、黄河（青海境内）以北地区增加到400斤，黄河以南、淮河以北地区增加到500斤，淮河、秦岭、白龙江以南地区增加到800斤。我提一点能否完成和如何完成这一任务的意见。
    全国粮食每亩平均年产量，在去年丰收的基础上，在北方增加一倍半以上，在南方增加一倍，起初觉得有些困难，后来从四方面分析研究，肯定可以完成。第一，今年全国可以基本上完成半社会主义的农业合作化，3年之内可以基本上完成全社会主义的农业合作化，个体经济所不能办的好事现在都能办了。水旱病虫等自然灾害能以集体的力量进行防治了；合理轮栽、提高地力等优良技术措施可以全面规划而实施了；改种高产作物和换用优良品种可以有计划的全面开展了；积肥、造肥可以有组织的进行而达到增施肥料的目的了。因此，今后农作物单位面积产量能大大提高是可以肯定的。第二，几年来各地都涌现出大批大面积高额丰产的典型事例，这许多先进丰产经验，有的还没有很好的总结出来，有的还停留在小地区小范围内没有推广开来，这是农业科学工作者没有尽到应尽的责任。必须迅速地把全国各种大面积丰产经验都总结起来，因地制宜的全面推广出去，今年如此，每年如此，农作物单位面积产量一定会全面不断的提高。第三，工业和水利等方面对农业生产的支援正在不断增长，必然成为促进农业增产的重要因素。例如双轮双铧犁和其他新式农具的大量制造供应，可以达到改进耕作技术的要求；病虫药剂的大量供应，可以及时而有效的防治病虫灾害；结合国家流域规划，兴修农田水利，减轻了水旱灾害并扩大了灌溉面积，使农业增产得到有力的保证。第四，农业科学研究机构已在全国范围内逐步建立起来，正在加强科学研究工作，农业技术推广机构正在增设和加强，今后科学技术对农业生产所起的作用一定能逐步加大。由于这四方面的积极作用，全国粮食每亩平均年产量，到3个五年计划完成的时候，分别增加一倍到一倍半以上是完全可能的。
    淮河、秦岭、白龙江以南是以水稻为主的粮食生产的重要地区，我做水稻工作多年，具体说明一下这一地区的增产潜力和增产可能性。这一广大地区，气候温和、雨量充足、土壤肥沃、灌溉便利，适宜高产作物水稻的生长。长期以来，形成了以夏季水稻为主的各种耕作制度，也蕴藏着无限的增产潜力。这一地区的耕作制度，主要有下面几种：（一）年种水稻二次，冬季休闲或再种一次冬季作物的双季稻区，南部各省多实行此种制度。（二）夏季种水稻，秋季种晚秋作物，冬季种大小麦或其他冬季作物的一年三熟制，如浙江中部，江苏浦东和成都平原等地方采用此种制度。（三）夏季种水稻，冬季种大小麦或其他冬季作物的一年二熟制，是长江两岸及以北地区的主要耕作制度。（四）夏季种一次高产晚熟粳稻，冬季栽培绿肥，确保一季丰产的地区，如江苏松江一带采用此种制度。（五）夏季种一次早中熟籼稻之后，蓄水沤田或休闲的一年一熟制，如江苏里下河地区和四川许多梯田，因水利关系而用此种办法。几年来，由于农民生产积极性很高，都在挖掘增产潜力，改变耕作制度，改进栽培技术，因而获得大面积高额丰产。例如广东潮汕地区，提高双季稻栽培技术，出现了千斤乡、千斤区和千斤县，个别每亩产量有高达2，000斤以上者；长江流域单季稻改种了双季稻，一般提高产量200斤以上。南部各省双季间作稻改种了双季连作稻，一般增产150斤到200斤以上，无论单季改双季、间作改连作，每亩产量1，000斤以上是很普遍的；江苏中部里下河地区一熟沤水田改为稻麦两熟田，多收一季，小麦单产200斤，还提高了水稻产量；江苏20多万亩旱地改为水稻田，平均每亩增产粮食250斤；四川万县引种银坊粳稻，单位面积产量增加到700斤。举出这几个例子，可以说明单是水稻一种作物，进行了单季改双季、间作改连作、籼稻改粳稻、旱地改水田、一熟沤水田改两熟稻麦田等耕作制度的改革，就大大提高了产量，再加上其他生产技术的改进和秋冬季作物的产量，粮食每亩年产量提高到1，000斤以上不是很困难的。亦就是说，淮河、秦岭、白龙江以南地区，粮食每亩平均年产量增加到800斤，是可以争取提早并超额完成的。
    为着高产地区迅速扩大并不断提高产量，低产地区变成高产地区并使产量步步提高，农业科学工作者必须急起直追，加强科学研究和科学普及工作，使科学技术能在农业生产中起更大的作用。高级科学技术人员的责任特别重大，对自我改造的要求应该是更高更迫切，我认识到为了做好科学研究工作，首先要克服3个缺点：第一，坚决克服右倾保守思想，我在这方面犯了严重错误，例如江苏金山县几年来做双季稻栽培试验，我从来没有重视这一工作，认为该地区不必种双季稻，结果不会太好，而去年已试种成功，产量达1，000斤以上；安徽沿江地区要试种双季稻，我认为希望不大，没有积极支持，而去年已大面积试种成功，像这种右倾保守思想不打破，是不能做好科学研究工作的。第二，坚决克服重理论、轻实践、不重视农民群众生产经验的思想，一定要虚心地向农民群众学习。像我过去徒凭一点旧知识、旧经验，不了解情况，不结合实际，坐在家里领导农业科学研究工作或农业生产工作，当然落后于形势发展。第三，坚决克服骄傲自大、自以为是的思想作风。我的自满情绪是很严重的，看见自己的优点看不见缺点，看见别人的缺点看不见优点，主观片面的处理问题，以非科学的方法做科学工作是不会有好结果的。例如对革命老干部，只看见文化科学水平不高的一方面，而不看见政治思想水平高的一方面，不能虚心向他们学习来改进自己的工作，这是科学工作的大敌人，一定要努力克服。
    最后，我坚决表示：为着迎接农业合作化高潮及其带来的农业生产高潮，一定努力学习马克思列宁主义，加强自我改造，提高政治思想水平，做好农业科学研究工作，提前超额完成全国农业发展纲要给予我们的光荣任务，并努力促使中国的科学技术迅速地达到国际先进水平。
