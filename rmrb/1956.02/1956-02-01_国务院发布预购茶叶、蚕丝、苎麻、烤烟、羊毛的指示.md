    The State Council issued instructions on January 27 regarding the pre-purchase of tea, silk, ramie, flue-cured tobacco, and wool for 1956. The instructions require people's committees at all levels, during the current high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, to comprehensively and appropriately arrange the pre-purchase of the aforementioned agricultural products in conjunction with the overall plan for agricultural development.

    The instructions pointed out: Tea, silk, ramie, flue-cured tobacco, and wool are all important materials for China's exports and domestic industrial raw materials. Currently, the production of these cash crops and wool is far from meeting the needs of the country and the people. With the rapid development of national socialist industrial construction and agricultural production, the country's need for industrial raw materials and agricultural products available for export will greatly increase. Therefore, actively developing the production of the aforementioned agricultural products is a very important task.

    The instructions pointed out that, based on the experience of pre-purchasing cotton, tea, and other agricultural products in 1955, pre-purchase has played a significant role in promoting production, overcoming some of the difficulties faced by farmers in production, encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production, and closely integrating national procurement plans with agricultural production plans. Therefore, it has been decided to conduct pre-purchases of five categories of products in 1956: tea, silk, ramie, flue-cured tobacco, and wool. Furthermore, pre-purchases will be carried out in full or in part, depending on the production situation and the concentration or dispersion of these products in different regions.

    The instructions stipulated that, in order to overcome the difficulties faced by farmers in production, encourage them to actively increase production and enthusiastically sell in accordance with national plans, pre-purchase deposits should be paid when signing pre-purchase contracts. At the same time, in order to take care of the actual needs of farmers who temporarily hire people to pick and process tea during the tea harvesting season, they should be given an increased supply of grain. In addition, the instructions also directed supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to give more consideration to the needs of cash crop production when allocating and supplying fertilizers.

    The instructions finally emphasized that pre-purchase work should be promptly arranged down to the township and cooperative levels, and the pre-purchase and material transportation and supply work must be completed before the start of the production season of the aforementioned agricultural products. In order to do a good job in the pre-purchase of the aforementioned agricultural products, it is necessary to conduct in-depth propaganda and education among farmers about the national pre-purchase policies and methods, so that the vast number of farmers can properly use the pre-purchase deposits, actively develop production, and ensure the completion of production plans and pre-purchase tasks.

    国务院发布预购茶叶、蚕丝、苎麻、烤烟、羊毛的指示
    新华社讯　国务院在1月27日发布了1956年预购茶叶、蚕丝、苎麻、烤烟、羊毛的指示，要求各级人民委员会在目前农业合作化运动高潮中，结合农业发展的全面规划，统一妥善布置上述各项农产品的预购工作。
    指示中指出：茶叶、蚕丝、苎麻、烤烟、羊毛都是我国出口和国内工业原料的重要物资，目前这些经济作物和羊毛的生产远不能满足国家和人民的需要。随着国家社会主义工业建设和农业生产的迅速发展，国家对工业原料和可供出口的农产品的需要将大大增加，因此积极地发展上述几种农产品的生产是一项十分重要的任务。
    指示中指出，根据1955年棉花、茶叶等农产品预购的经验，预购对促进生产，克服农民在生产中的一些困难，鼓励农民增产的积极性，使国家收购计划同农业生产计划得到密切结合，都起了重大作用。因此，决定1956年对茶叶、蚕丝、苎麻、烤烟、羊毛等5类产品进行预购。并且根据上述产品生产情况和地区集中、分散的不同，分别进行全部或部分的预购。
    指示中规定，为了克服农民在生产中的困难，鼓励农民按照国家计划积极增产和踊跃出售，在签订预购合同的时候，要分别付给预购定金。同时，为了照顾农民在收茶季节临时雇人摘茶制茶的实际需要，给他们增加一定的粮食供应。此外并且指示各级供销合作社在分配和供应肥料的时候，应当更多地照顾经济作物生产的需要。
    指示中最后强调指出，预购工作应该及时布置到乡到社，在上述农产品生产季节开始之前，必须完成预购和物资调运供应等工作。为了做好上述各项农产品的预购工作，必须把国家的预购政策和预购办法向农民进行深入的宣传教育，使广大农民妥善地使用预购定金，积极发展生产，保证生产计划和预购任务的完成。
