Some Problems Urgently Needing to Be Solved in Newly Established Advanced Cooperatives
Huang Jun

Last winter, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, experimentally established 150 advanced agricultural cooperatives, absorbing 21,000 peasant households (10% of the county's total peasant households).

After the establishment of these agricultural cooperatives, the cadres and the masses showed great enthusiasm; however, there are still many problems in operation and management that urgently need to be solved. Let's take a look at the situation of one of the cooperatives, the Longjing Cooperative with 412 member households:

Some cadres' and members' thinking still remains at the operational viewpoints of mutual aid teams, small-scale elementary cooperatives, or even small-peasant economy. They have "five fears": fear of a large scope of operation; fear of many operational contents; fear of high production increase targets; fear of adopting new production increase measures; and fear of adopting new forms of labor organization. Management committee member Cao Jinquan said: "To implement the responsibility system, it can only be done effectively by dividing a few mu of land to each household for scattered cultivation." Some advocate still operating in the manner of mutual aid teams or small-scale elementary cooperatives, accustomed to rigid division and flexible evaluation or temporary contracting. They lack sufficient understanding of the new situation after transitioning to advanced cooperatives, failing to see that the larger scale of advanced cooperatives, especially the abolition of private land ownership, overcomes the contradiction between unified management and private ownership in elementary cooperatives, making it possible to fully and rationally utilize land and fully leverage labor to carry out larger-scale basic construction on the land. This cooperative has more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields lacking water, making it impossible to plant double-season rice; after transitioning to an advanced cooperative, it is possible to build a reservoir that can irrigate more than 2,000 mu of paddy fields. The abolition of land remuneration and the implementation of a system of complete remuneration based on labor have also unprecedentedly increased the enthusiasm of the members, which is the most favorable condition for developing production. Faced with this new situation, should we guide operation and management with the viewpoint of a small-peasant economy, or with a socialist viewpoint? This is precisely the problem that urgently needs to be solved.

In formulating plans, it is necessary to focus on agriculture (to expand double-season rice to 85% of the cultivated land, and to greatly increase fertilizers and seeds), as well as forestry (planting trees, reclaiming tea mountains, and creating bamboo forests), animal husbandry and aquaculture (raising fish, pigs, chickens, and ducks), and also cultivate orchards; it is necessary to consider production plans, as well as financial plans. Because the plan is large and contains many contents, there is a lack of specific arrangements and specific steps for implementation, and the management committee does not know what to do first. According to the production increase plan, the entire cooperative needs 1,095,200 dan of base fertilizer, but the existing fertilizer is only 341,310 dan. How should this problem be solved? There are no specific measures yet. Another situation in formulating plans is: being conservative everywhere, stagnating at the original level, and the plan is far behind reality. For example, the original plan was to raise 261 pigs in 1956; later, after re-analyzing the specific conditions, it was understood that it could be developed to 3,000 pigs this year. It can be seen how serious conservative thinking is!

When dividing cultivation areas and production teams, the phenomenon of competing for good fields, competing for plowing cattle and farm tools, competing for key members, and competing for skilled workers constantly occurred. Team leader Chen Chunlin said: "If the plowing cattle allocated by the cooperative are not good, we don't want them, and the team will buy their own." Some even said: "If the division is not satisfactory, I will withdraw from the cooperative." In arranging labor, many problems also arise because the method of temporary contracting or rigid division and flexible evaluation is still adopted: key members are busy arranging work and estimating work. Team leader Chen Hanchi said: "I have meetings every night and call for work early in the morning. I am not a team leader, but a communication worker who calls people." Members cannot give play to their initiative, and many members wait at home for work, and phenomena such as absenteeism, wasteland, and wasted work constantly occur. The second production team sent 7 laborers to repair the field ridges of two fen of land, and some people had nothing to do when they arrived in the field. Because the work quotas and labor remuneration standards have not yet been determined, the phenomenon of competing for light work and abandoning heavy work and competing for work points has occurred. The sixth team arranged for 50 people to carry pond mud, and as a result, 35 people ran up the mountain to cut turf; a group carrying pond mud competed for work points, and no conclusion could be reached, and finally it was settled "according to conscience." Some things that did not meet the quality requirements were not the responsibility of anyone. The seventh team had 4 mu of land that should have been plowed three times and harrowed six times, but only plowed once and harrowed once.

This year, this cooperative plans to adopt new farm tools such as double-share plows, threshing machines, and rocker-arm harvesters; it plans to change the planting of 1,766 mu of continuous cropping rice, adopt the Nan Te No. variety, and change indica rice to japonica rice; it also wants to develop diversified operations, such as increasing the planting of technical crops, developing aquaculture and animal husbandry (planning to collectively raise 3,000 pigs), etc. All of these require new technologies. Many key members and members therefore feel distressed. Key member Chen Zijin said: "Doing new things requires new technologies. There are many things we don't know. We want to learn, but we lack teachers." The technology extension station and state-owned farms should focus on helping them; the cooperative should also actively summarize existing experience and train new technical personnel. It is necessary to ensure that each production team has skilled workers in various jobs, while strengthening technical education for all members and improving the technical level of the collective.

Recently, some comrades have raised such questions: "Now that the means of production in the advanced cooperative are public, do we still need to rely on the poor peasants?" Look at the current actual situation in the advanced cooperative: after joining the cooperative, how resolute are the poor and lower-middle peasants! What about the upper-middle peasants? Some people are still "in the cooperative, but their hearts are wavering"; the phenomenon of excluding poor peasants continues to occur. For example, Longjing Cooperative middle peasant Tang Meisheng said that poor peasant Liu Guilin was a "lazy man" and opposed including him in his production team. Middle peasant Li Shenggui firmly disagreed with poor peasant Chen Bingyan becoming the team leader. Although the means of production in the advanced cooperative are public, the differences in the ideological consciousness of poor peasants and middle peasants will not disappear all at once, and the private ownership concepts and decentralized management thinking of some members still seriously exist, and there are many contradictions with collective production based on remuneration according to labor. Political work is indispensable.

The countryside is changing fiercely and rapidly. Comrades working in the countryside should keenly see through the new situation and new problems, actively and assiduously conduct in-depth research and learning, and constantly strengthen their ability to lead socialist economic undertakings.

Advanced cooperatives are large in scale, the land situation is complex, and complete remuneration according to labor is implemented; organizing labor and calculating labor remuneration must be more scientific, more rigorous, and more reasonable in order to adapt to the new situation and better give play to the labor enthusiasm of the members. Advanced cooperatives should actively adopt the piece-rate system. Only in this way can we truly achieve remuneration according to labor and thoroughly implement the production responsibility system. And the primary and key issue in doing a good job in piece-rate work is to reasonably determine various work quotas. Work quotas are not easy to stipulate very correctly at one time, and a method of "try first and then set, set and then try again, and revise if it does not fit" can be adopted, gradually achieving complete reasonableness from basically reasonable. According to the production needs of advanced cooperatives, the system of year-round contracting and over-production rewards should generally be actively promoted, and it cannot stagnate at the original level of temporary contracting or no contracting. When arranging labor within the production team, attention must be paid to technical specialties, and the elderly, weak, and women must also be taken care of, so that everyone can make the best use of their talents. With the abolition of land remuneration, work should be properly arranged for the elderly and weak in particular.

Advanced cooperatives are large in scale, wide in scope of operation, and have many production contents; at the same time, the requirements for improving technology are also more urgent than those of elementary cooperatives. Cadres and the masses lack experience in running such cooperatives. However, we must also see the superiority of the advanced cooperative itself, the strong desire of the masses to actively develop production and do a good job in operation and management; we have also accumulated several years of experience in running elementary cooperatives. As long as we can strengthen leadership, go deep, study assiduously, rely on the masses, and give play to the creativity of the masses, we will surely be able to do a good job in operation and management.

    新建的高级社急待解决的一些问题
    黄峻
    湖南省湘潭县在去年冬天试办了150个高级农业合作社，吸收了21，000农户（占全县总农户10％）加入。
    这些农业合作社建立后，干部和群众的劲头都很大；但在经营管理方面还有许多问题急待解决。我们来看看其中的一个社——有412户社员的龙井社的情况吧：
    有些干部和社员的思想仍然停留在互助组的、小型初级社的甚至还是小农经济的经营观点上。他们有“五怕”：怕经营范围大；怕经营内容多；怕增产指标高；怕采取新的增产措施；怕采用新的劳动组织形式。管理委员曹金泉说：“要贯彻责任制，只有每户分几亩田分散作，才搞得成器。”有的主张仍然按互助组的或小型初级社的方式经营，习惯于死分活评或临时包工。他们对于转高级社以后的新情况认识不足，没看到高级社规模大，特别是取消了土地私有制，克服了初级社的统一经营和私人所有制之间的矛盾，能充分合理利用土地，充分发挥劳动力，进行土地上的较大的基本建设已成为可能。这个社有1，000多亩田缺水，无法种植双季稻；转高级社以后，可以修一个能灌溉2，000多亩田的水库。废除了土地报酬，实行完全按劳取酬的制度，社员的劳动积极性也空前提高，是发展生产的最有利的条件。面对这一新情况，用小农经济的观点来指导经营管理，还是用社会主义的观点来指导呢？这正是目前急需解决的问题。
    在制定计划上，要抓农业（要扩大双季稻到耕地的85％，要大量增加肥料和种子），又要抓林业（植树、垦复茶山和造竹林），抓畜牧水产（养鱼、养猪、养鸡鸭），还要培植果园；要考虑生产计划，还要考虑财务计划。因为计划大、内容多，缺乏具体的安排和实施的具体步骤，管委会一时不知道先作什么好。按照增产计划，全社需要底肥1，095，200担，可是，现存肥料只有341，310担。这样的问题应该如何解决，还没有具体的措施。制定计划的另一种情况是：处处保守，停滞在原有水平上，计划远远落后于现实。如原计划1956年养猪261头；后来重新分析了具体条件，才了解今年可以发展到3，000头。可见保守思想是何等严重！
    在划耕作区、分生产队的时候，争好田、争耕牛农具、争骨干、争能手的现象不断出现。队长陈春林说：“社里调的耕牛如果不好，我们不要，队里自己去买。”有的竟说：“划的不如意，我就退社。”在安排劳力上，由于仍是采用临时包工或死分活评的办法，产生的问题也很多：骨干分子忙于排工估工。队长陈汉池说：“晚晚开会，早早喊工，我不是队长，是喊人的通讯员。”社员不能发挥主动性，很多社员在家等事做，不断出现脱工、荒工和窝工等现象。第二生产队出动7个劳力去修两分田的田塍，有些人到了地里闲着没事做。由于工作定额和劳动报酬标准还没有确定，产生了争轻事丢重事和争工分的现象。第六队安排50人去担塘泥，结果有35人跑上山去削草皮去了；担塘泥的一个组争工分，得不出结论，最后还是“凭良心”了事。有些事情质量不合规定也没人负责。第七队有4亩田应当三犁六耙，结果只搞了一犁一耙。
    这个社今年打算采用双铧犁、打谷机、摇臂式收割机等新式农具；计划改种1，766亩连作水稻，采用南特号品种，改秈稻为稉稻；还要开展多种经营，如增植技术作物、发展水产和畜牧（计划集体养猪达3，000只）等。这些都需要新的技术。许多骨干分子和社员因此感到苦恼。骨干分子陈子金说：“办新事要新技术，很多事不晓得，我们要学，又缺乏师傅。”技术推广站和国营农场应该着重帮助他们；社内也要积极总结原有经验，培养新的技术人员。要使每个生产队里都有各种工作的能手，同时加强对全体社员的技术教育，提高集体的技术水平。
    最近，有的同志提出这样的疑问：“高级社生产资料公有了，是不是还要依靠贫农呢？”看看高级社内当前的实际情况吧：入社后，贫农下中农是何等的坚决！上中农呢？仍有一些人“人在社，心在摇”；排挤贫农的情况还不断发生。如龙井社中农唐梅生就说贫农刘桂林是“懒汉”，反对把他编在自己所在的生产队。中农李升贵坚决不同意贫农陈丙炎当队长。高级社生产资料虽然公有了，贫农和中农思想意识上的差别却不会一下子消失，部分社员的私有制的观念和分散经营的思想还严重地存在，同按劳取酬的集体生产有不少矛盾。政治工作是不可间断的。
    农村正在激烈地飞速地变化着，我们在农村工作的同志，应该敏锐地看透新的情况和新的问题，积极地刻苦地深入钻研和学习，不断加强领导社会主义经济事业的能力。
    高级社规模大，土地情况复杂，又是实行完全按劳取酬；组织劳力和计算劳动报酬必须更科学更严密更合理，才能适应新的情况，才能更好地发挥社员的劳动积极性。高级社应该积极采用按件计酬制。只有这样，才能真正做到按劳取酬，才能彻底实行生产责任制。而做好按件计酬工作的首要和关键问题就是合理地确定各种工作定额。工作定额一时不容易规定得十分正确，可以采用“先试后定，定了再试，不合再修”的做法，由基本上合理逐步做到完全合理。根据高级社生产的需要，一般应该积极推行常年包工和超产奖励制，不能停滞在原有的临时包工或者不包工的水平上。生产队内安排劳力必须注意到技术特长，又须照顾老弱和妇女，务使人尽其才。取消了土地报酬，对老弱尤其应该妥善安排工作。
    高级社规模大，经营范围广，生产内容多；同时，对改进技术的要求也较初级社迫切。办这样的社，干部和群众是缺乏经验的。但是，我们也必须看到高级社本身的优越性，看到群众对积极发展生产和搞好经营管理的强烈要求；我们也已经积累了几年来办初级社的经验。只要我们能加强领导，深入下去，刻苦钻研，依靠群众，发挥群众的创造性，一定能把经营管理工作做好。
