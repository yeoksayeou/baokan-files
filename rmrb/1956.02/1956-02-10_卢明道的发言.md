Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and warmly support Premier Zhou's political report and the reports of the four Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, and Dong Biwu, as well as those of Comrade Chen Boda. I am a petroleum worker. Ten years ago, in the era of the reactionaries, I was a dismissed and abandoned scientific researcher who went to Yumen Oil Mine to do general laboratory work. Last December, I was transferred to the preparatory office of the Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. Now, Yumen Oil Mine has been built from a desolate Gobi Desert into China's first petroleum base and a new industrial city.

The old society did not value technical personnel, let alone female technical personnel. However, after liberation, the leaders of the oil mine gave me extra care in training and education. Some Communist Party members said to me, "How much I hoped to see you, to see our female technical personnel!" These kind and enthusiastic words deeply moved me. I often think, I am now readily enjoying the fruits of victory won by revolutionary martyrs with their blood, what should I do to repay them?

In the early days of liberation, the leaders of the oil mine conducted profound class education for the employees for the first time by handling the April 5th Incident (an incident of oil mine workers fighting against bureaucrat capitalists), giving me more opportunities for firsthand experience. I began to understand what the working class is, and at the same time, I had a deeper understanding of the working class's tenacity and perseverance in struggle. I usually thought I was strong, but in comparison, I seemed very fragile. In the following years, under the leadership of the Party, the workers comrades achieved one victory after another on various production fronts through enthusiastic, tenacious, and selfless labor, which undoubtedly was the basic driving force for me to move forward.

I originally thought that I was not concerned about personal interests and could be considered a cadre who served the people wholeheartedly! When I was on a business trip to Beijing in 1951, I failed to stay in Beijing to do preparatory research work according to the leadership's intention, but emphasized some subjective wishes and went to Dalian to work for a few months. Later, through cadre review and initial ideological transformation, I found that I was actually unwilling to do tedious preparatory work at that time, regardless of the needs at the time, only caring about my own interests. Could it be said that I was serving the people wholeheartedly? With this understanding, when the leaders of the oil mine transferred me back in 1952, I said that the current Lu Mingdao is not the Lu Mingdao of 1951 and I would absolutely obey the organization's assignment. Indeed, I went back to the mine happily, giving up the good living and working environment in Dalian and going to where the organization needed me. Life was relatively hard, and working conditions were relatively poor. At that time, I was sure that I was serving the people wholeheartedly. However, when the leaders assigned some tasks that required creating some conditions to complete, I often emphasized the difficulties and tried to push them away in various ways, and only reluctantly accepted them when there was no way to push them away. In the 1953 summary, the Party and administrative leaders solemnly pointed out my shortcomings. I thought, regardless of objective needs, emphasizing subjective difficulties, could it be considered serving the people wholeheartedly? Based on this understanding, when the leaders assigned me the task of establishing a research office in August 1954, although there was only one desk and one cadre at that time, I did not resist emotionally and did not bow to difficulties. At the same time, I received full support from the leaders, and the work slowly started. At that time, the main work of the research office was to trial-produce new products, and I had some other experiences in this work. For example, at the end of 1954, Yumen Oil Mine wanted to solve the problem of self-supplied grease and decided to set up a small factory for self-production. The infrastructure department immediately carried out the design and construction of the factory, and the research office was required to study how to master the production method. It was proposed in November 1954 that the entire mine's grease would be required to be self-supplied in 1955. At that time, I thought that the task was very urgent and that my own technical strength was insufficient, so I proposed some specific methods, and the leaders strongly supported the organization of manpower to carry out the division of labor. I led the workers comrades to go to the Northeast and Shanghai brother factories to learn and master their advanced experience and production technology, and another group of people stayed in the mine to use the raw materials of the mining area for trial production. Brother factories gave us great help, enabling us to master the key to grease production in a very short time. We returned to the mine and merged with the personnel who stayed in the mine to participate in the trial factory work of grease, combining our own exploration experience with the mature experience of brother factories, plus the theoretical guidance of the Petroleum Research Institute in the field of grease research, clarifying the reasons for the oil-soap separation of calcium-based grease, and solving the biggest difficulty in our technology, making our trial production work proceed relatively smoothly. In terms of increasing the temperature of superheated steam, the worker comrades and technicians worked together to research and improve the furnace tube and overcome the difficulties. From this specific fact, I personally realized that this is a leap forward method, a method of absorbing existing achievements and gradually improving them. Therefore, I firmly believe that as long as there is the leadership of the Party to make comprehensive plans, and then organize the division of labor well, quickly learn and master the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and even the capitalist countries, the scientific departments that China urgently needs the most can catch up with the world level within twelve years. However, many ideological obstacles should be broken in learning. For example, in the process of trial-producing Vaseline, I had residual pro-American views, which hindered the speed of trial production. The fact is that several people have conducted exploratory experiments before and after liberation, and have failed many times. The Vaseline produced does not look like Vaseline and cannot be drawn into silk. I have asked several people who interned in the United States, and they mostly said that they have not seen how Vaseline is made in the United States, and there is very little mention of it in the literature. As for the silkiness problem, perhaps additives are needed to solve it. This prejudice remained deep in my mind, and I always felt that the silkiness problem of Vaseline was not easy to solve. The Petroleum Research Institute also encountered this nail when it started exploring, and later learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and successfully trial-produced it with ground wax. We adjusted the ratio according to the research institute. At the time of observation, the silkiness was not satisfactory. It was not until one of our comrades extracted a substance close to Vaseline from my mine's asphalt, which had very good silkiness, that I built up confidence. It is entirely possible to use Yumen's self-produced oil to blend qualified Vaseline without any additives. But in fact, there is information that Romania uses residual oil to make Vaseline, and someone has visited it, but we did not quickly learn from them and follow their path to find our suitable raw materials. Therefore, we have taken some detours. Through my above experiences, I have specifically experienced the reports of Premier Zhou and Vice Chairman Guo on the issue of intellectuals, and I believe that they are very correct and very timely. Only socialist society is opening up broad roads for science and technology, and only socialist society is opening up broad roads for scientific and technical workers.

Finally, I will actively and rapidly continue to work hard on self-transformation according to the three paths pointed out by Premier Zhou, strive to conduct scientific research under the national science development plan, learn from world advanced experience, and conscientiously and responsibly cultivate new forces. In the great march of science, I will be a loyal and diligent little soldier, and contribute everything I have to the great socialist construction cause.

    卢明道的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并热烈地拥护周总理的政治报告和李济深、郭沫若、陈叔通、董必武四位副主席以及陈伯达委员的各项报告。我是一个石油工作者，在10年以前在反动派时代以一个被遣散、被抛弃的科学研究工作者，到玉门油矿去做一般的化验工作。去年12月调到石油工业部中央研究所筹建处工作。现在的玉门油矿，已从荒漠的戈壁滩建设成为我国第一个石油基地、新型的工业城市了。
    旧社会不重视技术人员，更不重视女技术人员，但解放后油矿领导对我是加意的培养与教育。有些共产党员对我讲：“我是如何希望看到你，看到我们的女技术人员啊！”这种亲切热情的话是深深感动着我的。我经常想，我现现成成享受着革命先烈以热血换来的胜利果实，我拿什么去报答呢？
    解放初期，油矿领导以处理四五事件（油矿工人对官僚资本家斗争的事件）对职工首次进行了深刻的阶级教育，给我更多的机会去亲身体验。我开始认识了什么是工人阶级，同时对工人阶级在斗争中的顽强性与坚韧性有较深认识。我平时自以为是刚强的，相形之下就显得十分脆弱了。后来几年中，工人同志们在党的领导下，在各个生产战线上，从热情的顽强的忘我劳动中，所获得的一个胜利接着一个胜利，无疑的是鼓舞我前进的基本动力。
    我原来认为我不斤斤于个人利益的，大概可算是个全心全意为人民服务的干部了吧！1951年出差北京时，没能按领导意图留在北京做筹备研究所工作，而强调一些主观愿望，就到大连去工作了几个月。后来通过审干学习与初步思想改造，我发现我当时实际上是自己不愿意干烦杂的筹备工作，不管当时需要，只顾自己兴趣，难道能说是全心全意为人民服务吗？有了这个认识，当1952年油矿领导调我回去时，我说现在的卢明道不是1951年的卢明道了，绝对服从组织分配。确实我是高高兴兴回矿去了。放下了大连很好的生活环境与工作环境，到组织上需要我去的地方。生活比较苦，工作条件比较差，我当时的认识肯定我是全心全意为人民服务了。可是当领导交下一些任务，需要创造一些条件去完成时，我就经常强调困难，用各种方法把它推出去，无法可推时才很不乐意地接受下来。在1953年总结时，党和行政领导严正地提出我这缺点。我想，不管客观需要，强调主观困难，难道能算是全心全意为人民服务吗？在这个认识基础上，当1954年8月领导把成立研究室的任务交给我，虽然当时只有一张办公桌和一个干部，我情绪上没有抵触，没有向困难低头，同时也得到领导上的全力支持，工作就慢慢地开展起来。当时研究室主要工作是试制新产品，我在这项工作中另有一些体会。如在1954年底，玉门油矿要解决自用润滑脂问题，决定设小型厂自制。基建部门立即进行设计建厂，要研究室进行研究如何掌握生产方法。那是1954年11月提出1955年全矿润滑脂就要求自己供应。当时我认为这任务很紧，自己技术力量不足，就提出一些具体办法，领导上就大力支持组织人力，进行分工，由我带了工人同志到东北和上海兄弟厂去学习与掌握他们的先进经验与生产技术，另一批人留在矿上采用矿区的原料进行试制，兄弟厂给我们以很大的帮助，在很短时间内就使我们掌握了润滑脂生产的关键。我们回矿就与留矿人员合并组织起来参加润滑脂的试厂工作，把自己摸索的经验与兄弟厂的成熟经验结合起来，再加石油研究所润滑脂研究方面的理论指导，搞清楚了钙基润滑脂油皂分离的原因，解决了我们技术方面的最大困难，使我们的试制工作进行得比较顺利。在提高过热蒸汽的温度方面，工人同志与技术人员在一起研究改进了炉管，克服了困难。从这件具体事实，我自己体会到这是一个跃进的办法，吸取已有的成就再逐步提高的办法。因此，我坚信只要有党的领导能作出全面的规划，再很好地组织分工，很快地学习与掌握苏联以及新民主主义国家甚至于资本主义国家的先进科学技术，在十二年内我国最急需的科学部门是能够迎头赶上世界水平的。但在学习中应该打破很多思想障碍。例如，在试制凡士林的过程中，我就有残余的崇美观点，阻碍了试制的速度。事实是这样的，解放前后已有几个人进行了试探试验，多次没有成功，做出来的凡士林不像凡士林，拉不出丝，问过几位美国实习的人，他们多说没有看到过美国是怎样制造凡士林的，文献方面也很少谈到。至于拉丝性问题，亦许要用添加剂才能解决。这成见在我脑子里留得很深，总觉得凡士林的拉丝性问题是不容易解决的。石油研究所在开始试探时也碰了这钉子，后来吸取了苏联的先进经验，用地腊试制成功了。我们按研究所的比例调配，当时的观察，拉丝性方面还不令人满意，一直等到我们有位同志从我矿沥青中提炼出一种接近凡士林的物质，拉丝性很好，我才建立起信心。完全不用添加剂，用玉门的自产油料也可以调配出合格的凡士林。而实际上呢，罗马尼亚用渣油制造凡士林已有资料，并已有人去参观过，我们就没有很快地向他们学习，走他们的道路，找出我们的合适原料。因此，就多走了一些弯路。通过我以上这些经历，我是具体地体验着周总理和郭副主席对知识分子问题的报告，认为是十分正确而又十分适时的。只有社会主义的社会是为科学技术开辟着广阔的道路，也只有社会主义社会为科学技术工作者开辟了广阔的道路。
    最后我当积极地、加速地按周总理指出的三条道路继续努力进行自我改造，在国家的科学发展规划下努力进行科学研究，学习世界先进经验，认真负责地培养新生力量。在科学大进军中当一名忠实的勤恳的小兵，把我的一切贡献给伟大的社会主义建设事业。
