Workers in Harbin, Lüda, and Other Cities Put Forward a Large Number of Rationalization Proposals Recently

Since January, workers in Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, and Mudanjiang have put forward more than 10,000 rationalization proposals.

Of the 1,477 rationalization proposals put forward by workers at the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant in one month, 785 have been adopted. Workers at the Mudanjiang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory actively explored production potential and put forward 329 rationalization proposals in seven days. Workers at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, Jiamusi Machinery Plant, and Songjiang Machinery Plant put forward more than 200 rationalization proposals each in less than a month.

Most of these rationalization proposals put forward by the workers are aimed at solving key production problems. The steel made in the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant's steel casting workshop used to be unable to meet the needs of the entire factory. After adopting the workers' proposals to expand the hearth and other suggestions, the steel produced can meet the factory's needs to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. Workers in the Shi Fuyi group of the Jiamusi Machinery Plant's riveting workshop collectively created a main frame tire type for processing seeders, reducing the processing time from 83 minutes to 22 minutes.

Workers in various factories in Lüda City put forward a large number of rationalization proposals. The workers of the Dalian Shipyard put forward more than 260 rationalization proposals in one month, which is more than one-half more than the total number put forward in the entire previous year. The suggestion made by Zhan Shuijing, a worker at this company, to improve the processing of large crankshafts not only improved product quality, but also enabled the completion of the original 15-day task in only 9 days. Workers in the locomotive mechanical workshop of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant put forward more than 190 rationalization proposals in just over a month, more than double the number put forward in the entire previous year. Xing Jinheng, a worker at this factory, used to plane only two castings at a time on a gantry planer, but now he uses two tool rests to plane four castings simultaneously, increasing production efficiency by 64%.

    哈尔滨、旅大等市职工
    最近提出大批合理化建议
    哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯和牡丹江4个市的职工，1月份以来已经提出了1万多件合理化建议。
    齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂职工，在一个月内提出的1，477件合理化建议中，已经被采纳了785件。牡丹江机车车辆修理工厂职工，积极挖掘生产潜力，7天中就提出合理化建议329件。哈尔滨量具刃具厂、佳木斯机械厂、松江机械厂等单位的职工，在不到一个月的时间就分别提出了200多件合理化建议。
    职工们提出的这些合理化建议，大部分都是针对解决生产关键问题的。齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂铸钢车间，过去炼的钢满足不了全厂需要，采纳了工人提出的扩大炉膛等建议以后，炼出来的钢就能满足全厂提前一年完成五年计划的需要。佳木斯机械厂铆工车间石福义小组的工人集体创造了加工播种机的主架胎型，使加工时间由83分降到22分。
    旅大市各工厂职工提出大量的合理化建议。大连造船公司的职工，在一个月中提出的260多件合理化建议，比去年全年提出的还多二分之一以上。这个公司的工人詹水晶提出的改进加工大型曲拐轴的建议，不仅提高了产品质量，并且使原来计划15天的任务只用9天就完成了。大连机车车辆制造厂机车机械车间的工人，一个多月中提出的190多件合理化建议，比去年全年提出的件数还多一倍多。这个厂的工人邢金恒过去在龙门刨床上一次只刨两个铸物，现在改用两个刀架，同时刨四个铸物，使生产效率提高了64％。　（据新华社讯）
