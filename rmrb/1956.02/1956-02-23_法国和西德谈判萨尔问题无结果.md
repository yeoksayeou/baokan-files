Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 22nd: The two-day talks in Paris between French Foreign Minister Pineau and West German Foreign Minister von Brentano on the Saar issue ended on the 21st without reaching an agreement. The communique stated that the two sides will hold the next meeting in Bonn in March.

The Saar issue is a sharp contradiction between France and West Germany. After the Saar residents rejected the Europeanization Statute of the Saar last year and elected a parliament dominated by pro-German parties, the West German ruling group has taken advantage of this situation to more strongly insist that the Saar must be merged into West Germany. Sources revealed that France proposed in this meeting that France recognizes the right of the Saar to become German territory, but it must guarantee France's current economic status in the Saar, and the economic ties between the Saar and West Germany should be completed within 10 years. At the same time, as a condition for the Saar's merger into West Germany, France requested the construction of the Moselle Canal in West Germany to help reduce the transportation costs of France's Lorraine heavy industry. West Germany did not accept these demands in the talks.

    法国和西德谈判萨尔问题无结果
    新华社22日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部长比诺和西德外交部长勃伦塔诺在巴黎就萨尔问题举行的两天会谈在21日结束，没有达成协议。会谈公报说，双方将在3月间在波恩举行下一次会议。
    萨尔问题是法国和西德间矛盾尖锐的一个问题。在去年萨尔居民否决了萨尔欧洲化法规并且选出了亲德党派占优势的议会以后，西德统治集团利用这种形势已经更加强烈地坚持萨尔必须归并西德。消息透露，法国在这次会谈中提出，法国承认萨尔有权成为德国领土，但是必须保证法国目前在萨尔的经济地位，萨尔同西德的经济联系要延长到10年内完成。同时，作为萨尔归并西德的交换条件，法国要求在西德境内兴建摩塞尔运河以有利于减低法国洛林重工业的运输费用。西德在会谈里没有接受这些要求。
