    Yu Yixuan's Speech

    Chairman, fellow committee members:

    We have listened to Premier Zhou's political report, Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of the socialist revolution, and the reports of other leaders. We music workers, like everyone else, are very excited. Everyone expressed their enthusiastic support in the group discussions. I would like to express our warm support again on behalf of everyone here.

    Our great motherland has entered a socialist society heading towards prosperity and happiness. We all know that there is no socialism without culture, and socialist society means the unparalleled prosperity of science, technology, culture, and art. Therefore, the greater demands placed before us today than at any other time are only natural. This is a huge task, but also a glorious one. We music workers are determined to transform our thinking, improve our artistic level, and create art through hard work under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, in order to launch a high tide of socialist cultural movement. We want to make our lovely motherland bloom with beautiful artistic flowers. However, the current state of music work still lags far behind the needs of the masses, and the performance level is also not high. There are many reasons for this. In order to improve music work, I would like to make a few suggestions and hopes here.

    1. Every music worker should, like workers in a factory, set phased production targets and constantly engage in creative practice. Currently, many of our music workers seem to have retired from the stage prematurely. They often do not meet the masses as musicians, but as social activists, or as music administrative leaders. Over time, they may become empty-shell musicians. I think this is not good and should be corrected in time. We should earnestly demand ourselves, set personal production plans, and ensure them ourselves, and the organization should also ensure them.

    2. It is recommended that specialized institutions for holding concerts be established in major cities across the country. First, such institutions should be established in the capital to organize national instrumentalists and singers to hold regular concerts and conduct some tours within an appropriate scope. This will not only enrich the musical life of the masses but also be an effective way to improve the artistic level of the performers themselves, and it will also stimulate creation. All instrumentalists and singers who love the new China are willing to perform for the masses, but in recent years there have been so few concerts, and solo recitals can be said to have completely disappeared. The few symphony orchestras are just busy with film scoring and rushing temporary tasks, without their own performance plans. Recently, I heard that the Ministry of Culture has made some new plans regarding performance issues. This is good news and will be welcomed by the music community. I hope that concert performance institutions can be further established to guarantee the artistic practice of performers, thereby guaranteeing the growing musical demands of the masses.

    3. In our great motherland with a population of 600 million, not a single city in the country has a music hall. The fact that Beijing, our capital which occupies an extremely important position in the world, does not have a music hall is not commensurate with our magnificent and culturally rich nation of 600 million people. Therefore, I suggest that a music hall be built in the capital first. This music hall is not only necessary for domestic musical activities, but also for the increasingly frequent international artistic exchanges.

    4. In order to improve the quality of work and expand the existing team, in addition to tapping potential, correcting conservative views, and improving work methods, we must increase some necessary working conditions. For example, in the Central Conservatory of Music in Tianjin, there are difficulties in teaching. Take my own department, the Vocal Music Department, for example. First of all, there are not enough teachers. Everyone teaches too many classes, and it is difficult to find time for their own professional development. Therefore, I very much agree with what Comrade Dong Xiwen mentioned in his speech, that some people should be appropriately encouraged to teach part-time at the academy. For example, we have been learning national singing methods under very difficult conditions. Our Vocal Music Department of the Central Conservatory of Music has been adhering to learning from national singing methods since the establishment of the school after liberation, under the principle of studying Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. We believe that good singing art should include the qualities of beautiful sound essence and high vocal technique, vivid language, rich expressiveness, and strong national style. Academic singing methods and national singing methods each have their own characteristics, but relatively speaking, I think academic singing methods have more significant shortcomings in terms of language, expression, and style. Therefore, we need to absorb vitality from national singing methods and learn the advantages of national singing methods. We believe that this approach is proper, reasonable, and has achieved some preliminary results. We do not agree with viewing the two singing methods as having no mutual reference value, nor do we agree with mutual assimilation. We should respect our own nation's excellent traditions and respect the achievements of academic singing methods. However, singers of academic singing methods should humbly learn and improve the shortcomings of their singing methods. Therefore, I ask the leadership to support us and provide us with teachers in this area, so that we can better learn and research. Last semester, we hired a very good folk artist in Beijing, who came to teach us once every two weeks, but she only taught three lessons before she couldn't come anymore. What will happen next semester, we don't know yet. Students have repeatedly made requests in this regard, but we have never been able to satisfy them. Therefore, I am reminded of a problem: music workers and folk artists are a major concentration point in the capital. It is impossible for us to hire part-time teachers in Tianjin. If the Conservatory of Music is in Beijing, with the favorable conditions of concentrated manpower, the difficulty of hiring teachers can be completely overcome. At the same time, it is also of great significance to cultivate professional artistic talents in the environment of the cultural and artistic activity center. However, the only main campus of the Central Conservatory of Music for 600 million people is still located in Tianjin, and there is no Conservatory of Music in the capital. I always feel that this is a shortcoming. Beijing is a political, economic, and cultural and artistic center, and there should be a Conservatory of Music. I hope that this problem can be solved as soon as possible when various departments carry out comprehensive planning in the near future. I believe that under the principle of developing culture and art correspondingly while focusing on the development of industrial and agricultural construction, establishing a Conservatory of Music in the capital does not exceed the scope of this corresponding development. For the future development of the music industry, I hope the leadership will study the difficulties in our work, and I hope to give us some necessary working conditions and working environment. We music workers ourselves must have the spirit of overcoming difficulties and creating conditions, and truly contribute all our strength to the socialist music industry.

    Xinhua News Agency Correction:

    Add a paragraph after paragraph 3 of the "Liang Shuming's Speech" draft issued on February 6 (see page 5 of this newspaper on February 8): "Originally, the significance of going out for inspection is various. As Secretary-General Peng Zhen told us before we set off, it was to ensure that the central government's orders and all measures would not deviate from reality, would not deviate from the masses, and to prevent state agency staff from rusting—rusting with bureaucracy, and so on. But I think that eliminating some incorrect ideas and opinions of old intellectuals who live in Beijing and rarely come into contact with reality, making them believe in the correctness of the leadership, and strengthening national unity, is also one of the meanings of going out for inspection. The effect I gained from this trip is exactly this. If I hadn't gone out to see it for myself, I wouldn't have believed that such a rapid progress was a healthy development. I would have thought that the cadres below had a task-oriented view and were rushing to complete the task. Only after seeing it for myself did I clear up this opinion. Clearing up this opinion, for me, is precisely completing the task of going out for inspection."

    喻宜萱的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我们听了周总理的政治报告和郭沫若副主席的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告和其他首长们的报告，我们音乐工作者和大家一样都感到非常兴奋，大家在小组会上都纷纷发言表示了热情的支持。我再在这里代表大家表示热烈的拥护。
    我们的伟大的祖国已经进入走向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会了。我们都知道没有文化就没有社会主义，社会主义社会意味着科学技术和文化艺术的无比繁荣，因而今天摆在我们面前的比任何时候都更大的要求就是理所当然的事了。这是巨大的任务，也是光荣的任务。我们音乐工作者决心在毛主席文艺方针的指导下，努力改造自己的思想，提高艺术水平，百炼成钢地进行艺术创造，为了掀起一个社会主义文化运动的高潮而坚苦地劳动。我们要使我们的可爱的祖国开遍美丽的艺术之花。但是，目前的音乐工作还是远远落后于群众的需要，演出水平也是不高的。其原因是多方面的。为了改进音乐工作的目的，我想在这里提出几点建议和希望。
    一、每个音乐工作者都应该像工厂里的工人一样，订出阶段性的生产指标，要不断地进行创作实践。我们目前有不少音乐工作者，好像已经从舞台上提前退伍了，经常都不是作为一个音乐家和群众见面，而是作为一个社会活动家出现的，有的人是作为一个音乐行政领导人出现的，长此以往，就很可能成为一个空头的音乐家了。我认为这是不好的，应该及时纠正。我们应该认真的要求自己，订出个人的生产计划，自己要保证它，组织上也要保证它。
    二、建议在全国各大城市设立举办音乐会的专门机构。首先在首都设立这样的机构，组织全国的演奏家和演唱家定期举行音乐会，在适当的范围内做一些巡回演出。这不但可以丰富群众的音乐生活，对于演出者本人的艺术水平的提高也是一种有效的方法，同时对创作也是一种刺激。凡是热爱新中国的演奏家和演唱家都愿意为群众演出，而近年来的音乐会是这样的少，独奏奏唱会可以说是完全绝迹了。很少的几个交响乐队只是忙着电影配音，赶临时性的任务，而没有乐队本身的演出计划。最近听说中央文化部已经在演出问题上作了些新的计划，这是好消息，会受到音乐界的欢迎的。我希望能够进一步建立音乐会演出机构，来保证演出家的艺术实践，从而保证群众日益增长的在音乐上的要求。
    三、6万万人口的伟大的祖国，全国范围内没有那一个城市有一个音乐演奏厅，像我们这样一个在世界上占有极其重要地位的首都北京没有音乐厅，这与我们的雄伟而又具有优秀文化历史的6万万人口的大国是不相衬的。因此我建议首先在首都建造一个音乐厅。这个音乐厅不但是为国内的音乐活动所必需，而为了日见频繁的国际艺术交流的活动也是必要的。
    四、为了提高工作质量和扩大原有的队伍，除了挖掘潜在力，纠正保守观点，改善工作方法以外，我们必须增加一些必要的工作条件。例如，我们在天津的中央音乐学院，在教学工作中是有困难的，就拿我自己的工作部门声乐系来说吧，首先是教员不够，大家都教课太多，自己的业务进修很难找到时间。因此，我很赞同董希文同志的发言中所提到的，要适当的鼓励一些人来学院兼课。又例如我们在学习民族唱法问题上，一直是在非常困难的情况下进行的。我们中央音乐学院声乐系，从解放后建校以来，在学习毛主席的文艺方针的原则下，坚持向民族唱法学习。我们认为好的歌唱艺术应包含着美好的声音本质与高度的发声技巧、生动的语言、丰富的表现力、浓厚的民族风格等这些素质。学院唱法与民族唱法都各有特点，但相对之下，我认为学院唱法在语言、表现与风格方面是有更显著的缺点的。因此我们需要向民族唱法吸取生命素，学习民族唱法的优点。这一做法我们认为是正当的、合理的，而且有了一些初步的效果的。我们不赞成把两种唱法看成是毫无互相借镜之处，也不赞成互相同化。我们应该尊重自己民族的优良传统，尊重学院唱法的成就。但是学院唱法的歌唱者应该虚心的学习，改进自己唱法上的缺点。因此，我要求领导上支持我们，给我们这方面的教员，让我们有可能更好的学习、研究。我们上学期在北京请了一位很好的民间艺人，两星期来教我们一次，但只上了三次课，她就不能来了。下学期怎么办，我们还不知道，学生在这方面一再提出要求，我们始终不能满足他们。因此我连想到一个问题，音乐工作者和民间艺人在首都是一个最大的集中点，我们要在天津请兼任教员是不可能的，如果音乐院在北京，在人力集中的有利条件下，我们请教员的困难是完全可以克服的，同时在文化艺术活动中心的环境里来培养专业艺术人才也是有很大意义的。而6万万人的唯一的一个中央音乐学院总院至今还设在天津，首都并没有音乐院，我总觉得这是一个缺点。北京是一个政治、经济、文化艺术的中心，是应该有一个音乐院的，希望在最近各部门要进行全面规划的时候，能够早日解决这个问题。我认为，在重点发展工业农业建设的同时相应地发展文化艺术的原则下，在首都办一个音乐学院是不超过这个相应发展范围的。为了音乐事业的发展前途，我希望领导上研究一下我们在工作上的困难，更希望给我们一些必要的工作条件与工作环境。我们音乐工作者本身一定要有克服困难，创造条件的刻苦精神，真正的为社会主义音乐事业而贡献出自己的所有的力量。新华社补正
    2月6日所发“梁漱溟的发言”稿（见本报2月8日第5版）文3段后补加一段“本来出去视察的意义有种种，像彭真秘书长在临出发前对我们说的是为了使得中央政令和一切措施不至于脱离实际、不至于脱离群众，和少让国家机关工作人员生锈——生官僚主义的锈，如是等等。但我想对于住在北京很少接触实际的旧知识分子消除他们某些不正确的想法和意见，使他们相信领导上的正确，加强全国的团结，怕也是出去视察的涵义之一。我这次出去所得的效果正是这个。假如不是我自己出去看过一番，对于这样的突飞猛进不会相信它是健康的发展。我会以为下面干部存在着任务观点，又在那里赶任务。只有自己到下面看过了，才清除了这种意见。清除了这种意见对我来说，正就是完成了出去视察的任务。”
