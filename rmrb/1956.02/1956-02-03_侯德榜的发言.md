    Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow representatives:
    At the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, we listened to the political report by Premier Zhou and Chairman Mao, the work report of the Standing Committee by Vice Chairman Li Jishen, as well as the reports by President Guo Moruo on "The Mission of Intellectuals in the High Tide of the Socialist Revolution," Vice Chairman Chen Shutong on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and President Dong Biwu on the suppression of all counter-revolutionaries. All of these have given us great encouragement. We unanimously support them and suggest that the conference make a resolution on the political report and the work report of the Standing Committee and unanimously approve them.
    Our country is now surrounded by imperialism headed by the United States. The United States adheres to its so-called "strength" policy and creates international tensions. Therefore, it is necessary for us to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, strengthen national defense, and strengthen the forces to defend the motherland in order to deal with the threat of US imperialist aggression. We scientific and technological workers must contribute all our knowledge and strength, respond to Chairman Mao's call for "faster, better, more economical, and greater results," and strive to realize the country's socialist industrialization as soon as possible, and strive to liberate our territory Taiwan and complete the sacred task of liberating all of China!
    With the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce throughout the country has also entered a high tide. As Chairman Mao said: "The current political situation in our country has undergone fundamental changes." In the future, it will be raised from a semi-socialist nature to a fully socialist nature, so that the relations of production can adapt to the ever-developing productive forces. That is to say, changing this semi-private ownership to socialist ownership by the whole people will further liberate our country's productive forces. In order to complete the socialist transformation, we need our scientific and technological workers to give full play to our strength. The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) recently put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China not only puts forward the goals of struggle for farmers, but also puts forward topics for us scientific and technological workers and points out the direction of our efforts.
    As a scientific and technological worker, I deeply realize that we must unite, unite around our Party, and on the one hand, intensify our study of the advanced scientific and technological experience of the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, carry forward the precious heritage of the motherland. Actively study academic and professional work, improve the level of science and technology, oppose conservative ideas, and strive to catch up with the world's scientific and technological standards in the shortest possible time. To achieve this goal, we must study Marxism-Leninism, criticize the idealistic ideology of the bourgeoisie, establish a materialistic worldview and a communist outlook on life. At the same time, we should also adopt self-education methods, learn from Chinese Communist Party members, learn from workers, peasants, and labor models, accelerate ideological transformation, so that science and technology can serve workers and peasants, and can effectively serve socialist construction. Only in this way can we intellectuals be qualified to cooperate with workers and peasants, as a socialist alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.
    I am a relatively old scientist and engineer. In the past, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, seeing the corruption of the Kuomintang politics, I avoided talking about politics and avoided contact with politics. Therefore, when the liberation came, although I had no contact with the Kuomintang, I had no understanding of the Chinese Communist Party. It was not until the "New Political Consultative Conference" was held in the year of national liberation (between July and August 1949) that I returned from overseas. When I arrived in Hong Kong, I was threatened by the Kuomintang. I fled back to the north and arrived in Tianjin via Incheon. When I came to Beijing to attend the CPPCC meeting, I also gave Chairman Mao a letter (that is, an "abstract"), which said many wrong things about the industry. At that time, I had no understanding of the Party, and I still feel ashamed when I think about it today. I believe that there are many people like me among the older scientists and engineers. I am grateful to the Party for its care and patient education, which has finally made me realize the greatness of the Party and realize that the Party is entirely for the interests of the broad masses of the people. On behalf of the Chinese scientific and engineering community, I would like to pay the highest tribute to our Party and Chairman Mao. I guarantee that in the days of my life, I will contribute my strength to serve the people and complete all the tasks assigned to me by the Party. Let us cheer:
    Long live the glorious historical task of completing the ideological transformation and unity of the nation's intellectuals ahead of schedule!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

    主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    我们在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上，听到了周总理和主席的政治报告和李济深副主席的常务委员会的工作报告，以及郭沫若院长的“在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命”、陈叔通副主席关于资本主义工商业社会主义改造问题、董必武院长关于肃清一切反革命分子问题等报告，都给我们极大的鼓舞。我们一致拥护，并建议大会对政治报告和常务委员会的工作报告做出决议，一致通过。
    我们国家现在受美帝为首的帝国主义包围。美帝坚持其所谓“实力”政策，制造国际紧张局势。因此我们有必需提前完成第一个五年建设计划，加强国防，壮大保卫祖国的力量，来对付美帝侵略的威胁。我们科学技术工作者们，要贡献出我们一切的知识和力量，响应毛主席“又快、又好、又省、又多”的号召，为提早实现国家社会主义工业化而奋斗，并为解放我们的领土台湾，为完成解放全中国的神圣任务而奋斗！
    随着农业合作化的高潮，全国手工业和资本主义工商业的改造也进入高潮了。正如毛主席所说：“目前我们国家的政治形势已经起了根本的变化。”今后更将由半社会主义性质，提高到全社会主义性质，使生产关系能适应不断发展的生产力。也就是说，改变这种半私有制为全民所有制，进一步解放我国的生产力。为了完成社会主义改造，就需要我们科学技术工作者们充分发挥我们的力量。最近中共中央提出的全国农业发展纲要（草案），不仅仅向农民提出了奋斗的目标，也是对我们科学与技术工作者们提出了课题，指出了我们努力的方向。
    作为一个科学技术工作者，我深深体会到我们必须团结起来，团结在我们党的周围，一方面加紧学习苏联的先进的科学技术经验，一方面发扬祖国的宝贵遗产。积极钻研学术与业务，提高科学技术水平，反对保守思想，争取在最短时间赶上世界的科学技术的水准。要达到这个目的，我们必须学习马列主义，批判资产阶级的唯心主义思想，建立唯物主义世界观与共产主义人生观，同时我们还应采取自我教育的方法，向中国共产党党员学习，向工人农民劳动模范学习，加速思想改造，使科学技术能为工农服务，能有效地为社会主义建设服务。只有这样做，我们知识分子才有条件配合工人、农民，作为工、农、知识分子三位一体的社会主义大联盟。
    我是一个比较年老的科学家和工程师。我过去在国民党反动统治时期，见到国民党政治的腐败，就避免谈政治，避免与政治接触。故到了解放的时期，我虽然与国民党毫无接触，我对于中国共产党也毫无认识。一直到了全国解放那一年（在1949年7、8月间）开“新政协会议”的时候，我从海外归来，到香港时受国民党威胁，我逃回北方，经仁川到达天津。在我来京参加政协会议的时候，我还给了毛主席一封信（也就是“节略”吧），说了工业方面许多不对头的话。我当时对党毫无认识，到今日想起犹觉惭愧。我相信在老的科学家工程师们中，像我这样的人还多。我感谢党对我的关怀和耐心教育，使我最终认识到党的伟大，认识到党是完全为广大人民利益的。我谨代表中国科学界和工程技术界，向我们的党和毛主席致以最崇高的敬意。我保证今后，当我有生之日，贡献力量为人民服务，完成党给我的一切任务。让我们欢呼：
    提前完成全国知识分子的思想改造和团结这个光荣的历史任务万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
