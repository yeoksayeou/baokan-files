    Shandong Province is actively transferring various improved varieties needed for spring sowing this year. From the beginning of January to the 20th, more than 12 million jin of "Golden Queen" and "Ermaya" improved corn varieties from Huang County and Zhaoyuan County, and 3.5 million jin of "Red Bone" improved corn varieties from Tai'an Prefecture, have been transported to Heze, Jining, Dezhou, Huimin, and other places. The Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture has also sent people to Inner Mongolia to transfer improved potato varieties.
    Last year, the province stored more than 64 million jin of improved varieties of corn, rice, cotton, peanuts, sweet potatoes, soybeans, and spring wheat. Agricultural producers' cooperatives and individual farmers independently preserved approximately 78 million jin of improved varieties. Additionally, 31 million jin of improved varieties were transferred from other regions. The promotion of these improved varieties will enable the basic popularization of improved varieties of corn, potatoes, cotton, and wheat throughout the province, and the planting area of other improved varieties can also reach 50% to 70%.

    山东省积极调运良种
    山东省正在积极调运今年春耕播种需要的各种良种。从1月初开始到20日，黄县、招远县的1，200多万斤“金皇后”、“二马牙”玉米良种和太安专区的350万斤“红骨头”玉米良种，已经运往菏泽、济宁、德州、惠民等地。山东省农业厅还派人到内蒙古调运马铃薯良种。
    去年全省各地贮备了玉米、稻谷、棉花、花生、甘薯、大豆和春小麦等良种6，400多万斤，农业生产合作社和单干农民自行保存的良种约有7，800万斤，从外地调进的良种有3，100万斤。这些良种的推广，就能使全省玉米、薯类、棉花和小麦的良种播种面积基本上普及，其他作物良种播种面积也能达到50％到70％。
