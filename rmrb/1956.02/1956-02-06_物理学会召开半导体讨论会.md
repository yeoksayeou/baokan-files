The Chinese Physics Society held a semiconductor symposium in Beijing from January 30th to February 4th.

    The conference considered that, in order to adapt to the national economic construction, it is currently urgently required to rapidly and extensively develop semiconductor science and technology in China. If a large number of semiconductor electronic devices can be produced, it can save most of China's investment in the vacuum tube industry. At the same time, because the semiconductor industry does not require much equipment, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, such rapid development is entirely possible. The conference also believed that the development of semiconductor science and technology requires all departments to advance side by side and catch up.

    The conference suggested: First, the Chinese Academy of Sciences should promptly convene a semiconductor working conference including all relevant departments to prepare conditions for comprehensively formulating a national science and technology long-term plan. Second, in order to effectively and rapidly carry out semiconductor research work in China, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of semiconductor scientific research work and appropriately prepare for the construction of comprehensive semiconductor research bases nationwide. Third, semiconductor specializations should be established with emphasis in the physics departments of various comprehensive universities, semiconductor technology majors or specializations should be established in industrial universities, and semiconductor courses should be added to relevant disciplines. Fourth, in the work of establishing bases and training cadres, the existing potential strength of all parties should be fully utilized, and active assistance should be given to all talents who have the conditions to work in the field of semiconductors. Fifth, relevant industrial departments should immediately prepare for the construction of semiconductor factories. Sixth, relevant mining, metallurgy, chemical and other departments should quickly find ways to solve the problem of raw material sources in order to mass-produce various semiconductor devices. Seventh, scientists working on semiconductors should extensively carry out publicity work on semiconductor science and technology to deepen the knowledge of semiconductors among the masses.

    The conference called on all scientists working on semiconductors to strengthen unity, study hard, rapidly expand the team, and strive to catch up with international levels within 12 years, and dedicate the greatest strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    物理学会召开半导体讨论会
    中国物理学会召开的半导体讨论会，1月30日至2月4日在北京举行。
    会议认为，为了适应国家经济建设，目前迫切要求在我国迅速地、大规模地开展半导体科学技术。如果能生产大量的半导体电子学器件，就可以节省我国在电子管工业上的大部分投资，同时因为半导体工业所需要的设备不大，又有苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私援助，这样的迅速发展是完全可能的。会议还认为，半导体科学技术的发展，需要各部门齐头并进，迎头赶上。
    会议建议：第一，请中国科学院迅速召开包括各有关部门参加的半导体工作会议，为综合制定全国科学技术远景规划准备条件。第二，为了有效地在中国迅速开展半导体研究工作，有必要加强对半导体科学研究工作的领导，在全国范围内适当地筹建综合性的半导体研究基地。第三，首先在各综合大学物理系重点设立半导体专门化，在工业大学设立半导体工艺专业或专门化，并在有关的学科中，增开半导体的课程。第四，在建立基地和培养干部的工作中，应充分发挥各方面现有的潜在力量，并对一切有条件在半导体方面进行工作的人才给予积极的帮助。第五，有关工业部门应立即筹建半导体工厂。第六，有关矿冶、化工等部门，应迅速设法解决原料来源问题，以便大规模生产各项半导体器件。第七，和半导体有关的科学工作者应该广泛地开展半导体科学技术的宣传工作，使半导体的知识深入群众。
    会议号召，所有和半导体有关的科学工作者，加强团结、努力学习，迅速扩大队伍，一定要在12年内赶上国际水平，为祖国的社会主义建设献出最大的力量。
