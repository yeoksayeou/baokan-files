Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Tokyo newspapers report that the Japanese government decided on February 22nd that, unless the Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM) gives its understanding, it will not allow the exhibition of so-called "embargoed" goods at the Japanese commodity exhibition to be held in Beijing and Shanghai this autumn.

Prior to this, on February 14th, when the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued passports to Eiichi Yadoya, chairman of the "Beijing Shanghai Japanese Commodity Exhibition," and four others to travel to China, it presented them with a written pledge. This pledge required them to guarantee that they would not consult with the Chinese side regarding the exhibition of "embargoed" goods, and that they would not provide any guarantees regarding the exhibition of "embargoed" goods without the permission of the Japanese government.

This action by the Japanese government has been strongly opposed by Japanese business community figures. They generally believe that this is a step deliberately taken to obstruct Sino-Japanese trade. In response, Kumaichi Yamamoto, vice president of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and Eiichi Yadoya, chairman of the "Beijing Shanghai Japanese Commodity Exhibition," requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 22nd to withdraw this pledge. However, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to do so and insisted that it was doing so to avoid the Japanese government violating its "international obligations."

    日本政府阻碍中日贸易
    限制日本工商界在中国展览商品
    新华社23日讯　据东京各报报道，日本政府在2月22日决定：除非得到“巴黎统筹委员会”的谅解，将不准在今年秋天在北京和上海举办的日本商品展览会上展出所谓“禁运”货物。
    在这以前，日本外务省曾经在2月14日向“北京上海日本商品展览会”理事长宿谷荣一等五人发给前往中国的护照时，曾向他们提出一份誓约书，要他们签字保证决不同中国方面磋商展出“禁运”品问题，并且保证在不得到日本政府的许可前，不提供关于展出“禁运”品的任何保证。
    日本政府的这种做法遭到了日本工商界人士的强烈反对。他们普遍认为这是蓄意阻碍中日贸易的一个步骤。对此日本国际贸易促进协会副会长山本熊一和“北京上海日本商品展览会”理事长宿谷荣一已经在2月22日要求外务省收回这个誓约书。但是，日本外务省对此加以拒绝，并且硬说，它这样做是为了避免日本政府违犯国际义务”。
