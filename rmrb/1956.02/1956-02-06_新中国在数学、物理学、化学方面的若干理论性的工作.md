Several Theoretical Works in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry in New China
    Wu Zhi

Theoretical work in natural sciences is extremely important in the entire scientific undertaking. Without it, many complex and difficult problems that socialist construction raises for science, and will raise in the future, cannot be guaranteed to be solved, and the country's academic level will have no way to improve. Scientific workers engaged in natural science research clearly recognize the importance of scientific theoretical work, and they work diligently, contributing all their strength, and actively making beneficial contributions to socialist construction in theoretical research.

People's China cherishes all the labor achievements of scientific workers and attaches great importance to the study of scientific theory. If we read the preface to Professor Hua Luogeng's book "Additive Prime Number Theory," published in 1953 (in which Professor Hua Luogeng further developed the theory of additive prime number problems based on the research of Academician Vinogradov of the Soviet Union), we will clearly see how differently an important scientific achievement was treated in old and new China: In old China, this book could only be published in Russian in the Soviet Union with the sincere help of Soviet scholars, but it could not meet readers in its own country at all. However, after the founding of New China, this book was quickly published in Chinese with the encouragement of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Currently, in addition to continuing to guide young mathematicians in number theory research, Professor Hua Luogeng is also conducting various research in the theory of functions of several complex variables and modern algebra.

In 1954, the Chinese Academy of Sciences also published Professor Su Buqing's monograph "Introduction to Projective Curves" and Professor Chen Jiangong's monograph "Sum of Orthogonal Function Series." In these two books, the authors summarized their important achievements in mathematics research over the past few decades. In recent years, Professor Su Buqing has continued to study the theory of K-fold spaces and has obtained various important generalized theorems. Professor Chen Jiangong and his students have also made considerable gains in univalent functions in recent years.

Young mathematician Professor Wu Wenjun is working on topology, and his monograph on the Pontryagin characteristic class theory in topology will be published soon. In addition, some research work is being carried out in probability theory under the leadership of Professor Xu Baolu. In terms of function theory, Wuhan University and Peking University are also conducting research. A new generation of mathematical workers is growing rapidly. Many young people who have not been out of school for long are exploring the way forward under the guidance of senior mathematicians.

Speaking of theoretical research in natural sciences, we cannot fail to mention theoretical work in nuclear physics. Further understanding of the various laws of motion in the microscopic world, and understanding the characteristics and transformation processes of various atomic nuclei and various particles, will be of great help both in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy and in our understanding of the structure of matter. Today, the problems encountered by scientists in nuclear theory are numerous, and one of the key problems is what kind of interaction exists between the many particles that make up the atomic nucleus. Only by clarifying this problem can we thoroughly understand the structure, properties, and changes of various atomic nuclei. Professor Peng Huanwu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and his collaborators have conducted relatively systematic work on this issue, studying the effect of nuclear forces with two ranges, and calculating the binding energy of the two-nucleon problem and some light atomic nuclei.

Since the nuclear force is a special manifestation of the meson field, the study of the meson field is closely related to the exploration of the nuclear force. Professor Hu Ning of Peking University and his collaborators have been working in this area for several years, and have put forward some interesting new ideas on the problem of the meson field scattering matrix and the production of meson showers in high-energy particle collisions. In a recently published paper, he pointed out that in high-energy nucleon collisions, nucleons may lose the meson field in their peripheral parts and only retain the meson field in the region near the pole. The peripheral meson field becomes free mesons at the instant of losing the central nucleon, forming a meson shower. According to his theory, the nucleon collision radius during meson showering is much smaller than the nucleon radius previously speculated by people.

In addition, Chinese scientists are also conducting extensive research on the statistical theory of atomic nuclei, the shell structure theory of nuclei, the scattering theory of various particles, and the theory of nonlinear fields. In conjunction with the development of peaceful use of atomic energy, theoretical research in nuclear physics will continue to be strengthened.

In order to cooperate with the development of heavy industry, another team of physicists is working on the theoretical problems of solid-state physics. Solid-state physics is a new discipline that has developed in the past 20 years to study various physical changes inside solids, and its theory is of great guiding significance for obtaining solid materials for various special purposes. The theoretical content involved in this discipline is very rich. The topical theoretical research on solid-state physics currently being conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, and Nanjing University includes the properties of semiconductors, magnetic materials, crystallography, mechanical properties of metals, internal friction in metals, etc., and research on solid-state spectroscopy is also being actively carried out. Among them, the research on internal friction in metals conducted by Professor Ge Tingsui of the Institute of Metal Research and his collaborators has yielded more gains. Through the research method of internal friction in metals, they have conducted systematic investigation and analysis of the internal structure and changes of metals, and obtained several new results.

Theoretical research in the field of chemistry has also accelerated after the founding of New China. In this regard, the research on the chemical structure of organic compounds has achieved outstanding achievements. The research on the stereochemistry of aureomycin by Professor Wang You of the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and his collaborators has been quite successful. They resolved the racemic resorcrucine, thus synthesizing dextrorotatory aureomycin and finding a new method for synthesizing aureomycin. This series of works has important significance in aureomycin chemistry. Professor Zhu Ziqing and his collaborators have also conducted research on the chemical structure of fritillaria alkaloids and obtained new results.

Professor Tang Aoqing of Northeast People's University and his collaborators have achieved good results in using quantum chemical methods to study internal molecular rotation. We know that internal molecular rotation is closely related to the internal structure of molecules and many other important properties of molecules, such as the viscosity and elasticity of rubber-like molecules. The study of internal molecular rotation can help us understand the relationship between molecular structure and their properties, and can also help us synthesize compounds with special properties with more confidence. In addition to making new contributions to the theory of internal molecular rotation, Professor Tang Aoqing and his collaborators also obtained a general formula for the end-to-end distance of linear polymers. These results are helpful for the study of polymer structure.

In the field of quantum chemistry, existing calculation methods such as the electron pair method and the molecular orbital method have shortcomings, that is, they cannot be accurately and flexibly applied to molecular structure problems. At the All-Union Discussion on Theoretical Problems of Chemical Structure in Organic Chemistry in the Soviet Union in 1951, Academician Cherenin pointed out that what is more practical in chemical structure is not individual electrons, but individual bonds, and quantum chemical calculations should be based on single bonds. Professor Peng Huanwu, following the direction pointed out by Academician Cherenin, introduced the wave function of individual bonds and established a new quantum mechanical calculation method based on this, which reflects the laws of internal molecular structure. This research work is still in progress.

Not only has theoretical scientific research in mathematics, physics, and chemistry made great progress, but also in other fields such as biology, geophysics, technology, etc., theoretical scientific research has also made great progress. Many theoretical works that did not exist in the past have been or will be established in the shortest possible time. Theoretical scientific research in New China is closely linked to practice and closely integrated with the needs of the country, which is the source of the power that promotes its rapid development.

    新中国在数学、物理学、化学方面的若干理论性的工作
    吴之
    自然科学方面的理论性的工作，在整个科学事业中是极为重要的。没有它，社会主义建设事业向科学提出的和将来要提出的许多复杂繁难的问题，就不能保证得到解决，祖国的学术水平也将无从提高。从事自然科学研究的科学工作者们清楚地认识到科学理论工作的重要，他们辛勤地劳动着，贡献着自己的一切力量，在理论研究方面积极地为社会主义事业作出了有益的贡献。
    人民的中国珍视着科学工作者的一切劳动成果，并且十分重视科学理论的研究。如果我们读一读1953年出版的华罗庚教授的著作“堆垒素数论”（在这本书里，华罗庚教授在苏联维诺格拉陀夫院士的研究的基础上进一步发展了关于堆垒素数问题的理论）的序文，我们就会清楚地看到，一个重要的科学成果在旧中国和新中国有着多么不同的遭遇：在旧中国，这本书只能通过苏联学者们的真诚帮助在苏联刊出俄文版，而在自己的国家却根本不能同读者见面。可是在新中国成立后，这本书很快地就在中国科学院的鼓励下用中文出版了。目前，华罗庚教授除了继续指导青年数学工作者在数论方面进行研究外，还在多复变数函数论和近世代数方面进行着多方面的工作。
    1954年中国科学院还出版了苏步青教授的专著“射影曲线概论”和陈建功教授的专著“直交函数级数的和”。在这两本书里，作者们总结了他们过去几十年在数学研究中的各项重要成就。近几年里，苏步青教授继续研究着K展空间的理论，并且得出了各种重要的拓广的定理。陈建功教授和他的学生们几年来在单叶函数方面也有了不少的收获。
    青年数学家吴文俊教授在拓扑学方面进行着工作，他所写的关于拓扑学中邦特里亚金示性类论的专著，不久将要出版。此外概率论方面在许宝騄教授领导下进行了一些研究工作。函数论方面，武汉大学、北京大学方面也正进行着研究。年轻一代的数学工作者正在迅速地成长着。很多离开学校不很久的青年人在前辈数学家的指导下，正在探索着前进的道路。
    说到自然科学的理论性研究，我们就不能不提起原子核物理学方面的理论工作。进一步理解微观世界的各种运动规律，理解各种原子核和各种粒子的特性和转化过程，无论在和平利用原子能方面，或在我们对于物质构造的认识方面都将有极大的帮助。今天在原子核理论方面，科学工作者所遇到的困难问题是很多的，其中关键性的问题之一就是组成原子核的许多粒子之间有着怎样的相互作用。只有弄清楚了这个问题，才能彻底了解各种原子核的构造、性质和变化。中国科学院彭桓武教授和他的合作者曾对这个问题进行了比较系统的工作，研究了具有二种力程的核子力的作用，并且计算了二核子问题和一些轻原子核的结合能。
    由于核子力是介子场作用的一种特殊表现，所以介子场的研究和核子力的探讨有着极密切的关系。北京大学胡宁教授和他的合作者几来年在这方面进行着工作，在介子场散射方阵的问题和高能粒子碰撞中产生介子簇射的问题上提出了一些有趣的新见解。在不久前发表的论文中，他指出，在高能核子碰撞时，核子可能失去其外围部分的介子场，而只保留极附近区域的介子场。外围部分介子场在失去中心核子的瞬时，变为自由介子，形成介子簇射。根据他的理论，介子簇射时的核子碰撞半径要比过去人们所推测的核子半径小得多。
    此外，中国的科学工作者们在原子核的统计性理论、核的壳层结构理论、各种粒子的散射理论和非线性场的理论等方面都正广泛地进行着研究工作。配合着原子能和平利用工作的展开，原子核物理学理论研究工作还将不断加强。
    为了配合重工业的发展，另外一支物理学工作者所组成的队伍正在固体物理学的理论问题上展开工作。固体物理学是近20多年来发展起来的研究固体内部各种物理变化的新学科，它的理论对于获取各种特殊用途的固体材料有很重要的指导意义。这一门学科所涉及的理论内容是十分丰富的，现在中国科学院和北京大学、南京大学所进行的固体物理专题性理论研究就已包括了半导体性质、磁性物质、结晶学、金属力学性质、金属中的内耗等等方面，固体光谱学的研究也在积极展开。其中有较多收获的是金属研究所葛庭燧教授和他的合作者所进行的金属中内耗的研究。他们通过金属内耗的研究方法，对金属内部的构造和变化进行了系统的考察和分析，并且得出了若干新的结果。
    化学领域中的理论性研究也同样在新中国成立后加快了发展速度。在这方面有突出成就的是有机化合物的化学结构方面的研究。中国科学院有机化学研究所汪猷教授和他的合作者对橘霉素的立体化学的研究是相当成功的。他们拆分了无旋雷斯屈克酚，从而合成了右旋橘霉素，找到了新的合成橘霉素的方法。这一系列的工作，在橘霉素化学中具有很重要的意义。朱子清教授和他的合作者在贝母植物硷方面，也进行了化学结构的研究，并且得出了新的结果。
    东北人民大学唐敖庆教授和他的合作者用量子化学方法对分子内旋转进行研究已经获得了良好的成绩。我们知道，分子内旋转和分子内部结构以及分子的其他许多重要性质，例如橡胶类分子的粘度和弹性，有极密切的关系。分子内旋转的研究可以帮助我们了解分子结构和它们的性质之间的关系，还可以帮助我们更有把握地合成具有特殊性能的化合物。唐敖庆教授和他的合作者除了在分子内旋转理论上有了新的贡献外，还得到了线型高分子的末端距离的一般公式。这些结果对于高分子结构的研究都是有帮助的。
    在量子化学的领域里，现有的计算方法如电子对法及分子轨道法都是有缺点的，这就是说，它们都不能准确地、灵活地运用到分子结构问题中去。1951年在苏联的有机化学中化学结构理论问题的全苏讨论会上，切烈宁院士曾经指出，化学结构中更有实际意义的不是个别电子，而是个别的键，量子化学的计算应该以单个键作为基础。彭桓武教授依着切烈宁院士所指出的方向引入了个别键的波函数，并以此为基础建立了一个反映分子内部结构规律的新的量子力学计算方法。这个研究工作还正在继续进行。
    不仅数学、物理学、化学各领域中的理论性科学研究有了很大的发展，而且在其他如生物学、地球物理学、技术科学等等方面，理论性的科学研究也同样有很大的发展。很多过去所没有的理论工作都已经或将在最短时间内建立起来。新中国的理论性科学研究和实践紧密地联系着，和国家的需要紧密地结合着，这就是推动它迅速发展的力量的源泉。
