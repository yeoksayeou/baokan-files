Xinhua News Agency, 12th — Over 6,000 overseas Chinese students and youth from the capital held a grand Spring Festival get-together this morning at the Soviet Exhibition Center.

    The overseas Chinese students and youth from the capital sang and danced joyfully in the beautifully decorated Industry Hall. In the four game rooms on both sides of the Industry Hall, people were guessing lantern riddles, shooting air guns, and "finding mineral deposits," playing various games. Bu Guowei, an overseas Chinese student who had just joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, said: I have felt the warmth of a big family in the motherland. In the future, I must study hard and serve the motherland better.

    Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Chen Qiyuan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and more than 300 returned overseas Chinese in Beijing also participated in today's get-together. At the meeting, Liao Chengzhi congratulated the overseas Chinese students on their good health and better studies, and on being more united with the youth in Beijing, becoming good students of Chairman Mao, and becoming good cadres serving the construction of the motherland in the future.

    Actors from the Central Song and Dance Troupe, the Central National Song and Dance Troupe, and other units performed wonderful programs at the meeting.
