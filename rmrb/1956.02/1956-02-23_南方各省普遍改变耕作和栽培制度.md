Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: This year, the area of farmland where cultivation and planting systems have been changed in the South is very large. In provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei, the planting area that has been changed from dry land to paddy fields, from Indica rice to Japonica rice, from single-season rice to double-season rice, and from two crops a year to three crops a year has reached 138 million mu. Among them, the area changed from single-season rice to double-season rice accounts for 18.7 million mu. This figure alone is 6.7 million mu more than the total area planned for changing rice field cultivation systems nationwide at last year's national rice production technology conference. These changes in cultivation systems will increase grain production for the country in large quantities. Based on calculations from Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces alone, more than 7 billion jin of grain will be produced this year on land where the cultivation system has been changed.
The widespread change in farming and cultivation systems has been carried out after the great development of agricultural cooperativization. The Party committees and agricultural departments of all provinces and regions have attached importance to and strengthened the leadership of this work. Jiangxi, Hubei and other provinces have successively convened agricultural technology conferences and Japonica rice technology conferences, and made specific plans and measures. Zhejiang Province organized agricultural production cooperative chairmen and representatives to go to various places to learn the techniques of planting double-season rice and various cash crops. Since December last year, Anhui Province has been holding agricultural technology training classes in various places to impart the experience of "three changes."
In order to ensure increased production after the change of cultivation system, farmers in various places have formulated specific plans and actively engaged in farmland water conservancy construction and increased fertilizer accumulation.

    南方各省普遍改变耕作和栽培制度
    新华社22日讯　今年南方各地改变耕作制度和栽培制度的面积很大。广东、福建、江西、浙江、江苏、安徽、湖南、湖北等省，今年由旱地改水田、籼稻改粳稻、单季稻改双季稻、二熟改三熟的种植面积就达13，800万亩，其中由单季稻改为双季稻的面积占1，870万亩，单这个数字就比去年全国水稻生产技术会议上，规划全国改变稻田栽培制度的总面积增加了670万亩。这些耕作制度的改变，将为国家增产大量粮食。仅广东、湖南、江西三省计算，今年将在改变耕作制度的土地上，增产70多亿斤粮食。
    普遍改变耕作、栽培制度是在农业合作化大发展以后开展起来的。各省区的中共党委和农业部门，都重视和加强了对这一工作的领导。江西、湖北等省都先后召开了农业技术会议和粳稻技术会议，作出了具体的规划和措施。浙江省组织农业生产合作社社长和代表到各地学习种植双季稻和各种经济作物的技术。安徽省从去年12月以来，就在各地举办农业技术训练班传授“三改”经验。
    各地农民为保证改变耕作制度后获得增产，都具体的制定了计划，积极兴修农田水利，增积肥料。
