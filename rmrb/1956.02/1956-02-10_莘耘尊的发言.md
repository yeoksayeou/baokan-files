    Xin Yunzun's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I am an engineering technician working at the First Automobile Works. The First Automobile Works is one of the 156 key projects in China's socialist industrial construction. Regarding the factory's construction, comrades must have already seen a lot in the newspapers. I would like to briefly report on the recent situation here: The civil construction of the factory is basically completed, and production preparations are underway, with some parts already in production. The original plan was to complete the factory construction in four years, but it has now been completed ahead of schedule in two and a half years. We will also complete the five-year production plan in four and a half years. A lively labor competition is now underway between departments and sections within the factory. Automobiles will be produced this year! These are the first offspring of China's automobile industry. On October 1st, we must present the automobiles made by the Chinese people themselves to Chairman Mao in Tiananmen Square! For this glorious task of historical and global significance, all factory workers are completing it with the highest degree of labor enthusiasm and full confidence, and with the greatest determination. The successful completion of this glorious and arduous task, and the high level of labor enthusiasm of all employees, is entirely due to the correct leadership of the Party. Of course, it is also inseparable from the support of the people of the whole country. At the same time, we must especially thank the sincere and selfless help of the great Soviet Union. From the factory site survey, design drawing supply, to equipment, all were aided by the Soviet Union. The Soviet government also sent many experts mastering the most advanced technology to the factory to provide specific guidance. Such a huge and technologically advanced factory was built in just two and a half years. Without the leadership of the Party and the assistance of the Soviet Union, this would be unimaginable. Comrades who went to the Soviet Union for internships said upon their return: "The most advanced automobile factory in the world is not in Moscow, but in China." This shows how the Soviet people gave us the best machines in their country and selflessly taught us the most advanced technology. What friendship in the world is more precious and profound than this!
    It is under such selfless assistance from the Soviet Union that the construction of the factory buildings mostly adopted advanced factory-style and mechanized construction methods. In the cold climate of Northeast China, where temperatures are below minus 30 degrees Celsius, we did not stop the factory construction. Under the guidance of experts, we also carried out winter construction. In the construction process, a large number of new construction talents of the motherland were cultivated, and quite a few excellent young technicians basically mastered the design and construction technology. Old engineering personnel also saw their skills put to use, and at the same time felt that their work in the past many years was not as meaningful and improved as rapidly as in these two years. This would also be unimaginable if it were not in the era of Mao Zedong.
    In the old society, women suffered from four layers of oppression, leading parasitic lives, and only saw the small circle of their own families. Today, Chairman Mao has led all Chinese women to liberate themselves, enabling us to see our independent personality and our strength. We have walked out of the small courtyard and participated in the socialist construction of the motherland. Before liberation, I myself hated the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and dreamed of hiding in school and living a so-called "aloof" life. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I have seen the motherland embark on the road of prosperity and strength, and a bright and infinitely broad future of the motherland has unfolded before me. I realized that I am an intellectual of the new China, and I have corrected my outlook on life and learned how to live.
    After liberation, I participated in the construction work of Beijing. This time, returning to Beijing, I saw how many tall buildings have been built, saw the water of the Yongding River being diverted to our capital, saw West Chang'an Avenue has been widened several times, and saw the Jin'ao Yu? Bridge being rebuilt. In just one year, so many plans have been realized. We don't have to worry about our ideals not being realized, the question is how to create rich imagination and how to tenaciously overcome technical backwardness. The motherland needs us to use beautiful ideals to build it more beautiful and greater.
    This time, the Party's great call to intellectuals has made me more personally experience the Party's wise leadership and the Party's cordial concern for intellectuals, and at the same time recognize the great responsibility of intellectuals in participating in the construction of the motherland. I must follow the instructions of Premier Zhou and President Guo to intellectuals, earnestly strengthen my ideological transformation, strive to improve my technical level, study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, and closely rely on the Party. Although I am not old myself, I still need to do my best to help train younger technicians to expand our ranks, and after a certain period of time under the guidance of the older generation of engineers, I will also become an engineer who is close to the world's advanced level, a red engineer. I will unreservedly dedicate all my strength to the cause of communism. This is the guarantee I give to the conference, and the letter of determination I give to the Party.

    莘耘尊的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我是一个工程技术人员，在第一汽车制造厂工作。第一汽车制造厂是我国社会主义工业建设156项重点工程中的一项。关于建厂情况，同志们在报纸上一定已经看到很多，我想在这里简单地把最近的情况汇报一下：现在厂的土建部分已基本完成，正在进行生产准备，并且部分已投入生产。原订计划是四年完成建厂，现在已经在两年半的时间内提前完成了。我们还要在四年半的时间内完成五年的生产计划。现在厂内正热烈展开了科际、处际的劳动竞赛。今年就将出产汽车了！这是中国汽车工业的第一批产儿。在10月1日，我们一定要把中国人民自己造的汽车送到天安门前来献给毛主席！对于这件有历史意义、有世界意义的光荣任务，全厂职工正以最高度的劳动热情，满怀信心，并且以最大的决心去完成。这光荣而艰巨的任务之得以完成，全体职工劳动积极性之得到高度发挥，完全是由于党的正确领导。当然，也是和全国人民的支援分不开的。同时我们还要特别感谢伟大苏联真诚无私的帮助。建厂中从厂址的勘察、设计图纸的供应，以至设备，全部都是苏联帮助的。苏联政府还派遣了很多掌握最先进技术的专家来厂具体指导工作。这样一个规模巨大、技术最新的工厂在短短的两年半当中就建成了，如果没有党的领导和苏联的援助，这是不可想像的。派去苏联实习的同志们回来说：“世界上最先进的汽车制造厂不在莫斯科，而是在中国。”这说明了苏联人民怎样把自己国内最好的机器送给了我们，把最高等的技术无私地教给了我们。世界上还有什么友谊比这更珍贵、更深厚呢！
    就是在苏联这样无私的援助下，厂房的建设大部分是采用了工厂化、机械化的先进施工方法。在东北零下30多度的寒冷气候里，我们并没有停止建厂工作，在专家指导下还进行了冬季施工。在建厂中大量地培养了祖国新生的基建人材，相当多的优秀青年技术人员基本上掌握了设计和施工的技术。旧的工程人员在技术上也得到了发挥，同时还感觉到过去多少年来的工作也没有像在这两年当中这样有意义，提高得这样快。这如果不是在毛泽东时代，也是不可想像的。
    在旧社会里，妇女受着四重压迫，过寄生的生活，看到的只是自己家庭的小圈子。今天毛主席领导全中国妇女解放了自己，使我们看到了自己独立人格，看到了自己的力量。我们走出了小天井，参加祖国的社会主义建设工作。我自己在解放前，由于痛恨蒋匪的黑暗统治，梦想躲在学校里过一辈子所谓“清高”的生活；自从解放以后，在党和毛主席的领导下，看到祖国走上了繁荣富强的道路，在我面前展开了祖国光辉灿烂无限广阔的前途，我觉悟到我是一个新中国的知识分子，我才端正了自己的人生观，知道怎样去活。
    解放以后，我曾参加过北京市的建设工作。这次回到北京看见多少大楼盖起来啦，看见了永定河的水正引向我们的首都，看见了西长安街已经展宽了几倍，看见金鳌玉?桥正在改建。短短一年时间，多少计划实现了。我们不用担心理想不得实现，问题是怎样创造丰富的想像，怎样顽强地克服技术上的落后。祖国正需要我们用美好的理想把它建设得更美丽，更伟大。
    这次党对知识分子的伟大号召，使我更亲身体会到党的英明领导，党对知识分子的亲切关怀，同时也认识到知识分子在参加祖国建设事业中责任的重大。我一定要遵照周总理和郭院长对知识分子的指示，认真加强自己的思想改造，努力提高技术水平，学习马克思列宁主义毛泽东著作，紧紧地依靠党。虽然我自己还不老，但是还需要尽力帮助培养更年轻的技术人员，来扩大我们的队伍，并且在老辈工程师的指导下经过一定时间以后，使自己也成为一个接近世界先进水平的工程师、一个红色工程师。我将无保留地为共产主义事业献出我的全部力量。这就是我向大会提出的保证，向党提出的决心书。
