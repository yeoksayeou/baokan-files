    Making it Easier for Residents to Buy Vegetables
    A Record of the Transformation of Beijing's Vegetable Vendors
    Jiang Xia

    In the streets and alleys of Beijing, mobile vegetable carts of vegetable joint purchase and sales groups, marked with small red flags, have recently appeared everywhere. Residents are now happily purchasing the various fresh vegetables they need from these carts in their neighborhood. Vegetable joint purchase and sales groups—these elementary cooperative organizations with socialist sprouts—were, not long ago, small vegetable vendors operating independently. Before they were organized, residents did not trust them as they do now.

    Residents distrusted them not only because most of these vendors had used methods such as "giving short weight and adding more water" to deceive customers, but also because they often raised vegetable prices behind the scenes. Take cucumbers, for example. In the normal cucumber season, they sold for only eight or nine cents a pound, but if there was a windy or rainy day the next day, the vendors could raise the price of cucumbers to twenty cents a pound. These vendors often rushed to buy popular vegetables with high profits at the wholesale market, but took a wait-and-see attitude towards vegetables with low profits, waiting for prices to fall. Last summer, after Chinese cabbage, cabbage, and tomatoes were on the market, there was a large backlog. At its peak, more than 1 million catties were backlogged in a single day. The Municipal Vegetable Company mobilized them to actively promote sales, but no one listened. They waited and did not buy, waiting for prices to fall, resulting in a large amount of vegetables rotting in vain.

    In March of last year, the Beijing Vegetable Company, in cooperation with relevant departments, helped them form joint purchase and distribution groups (jointly buying vegetables, operating independently, and assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses), reasonably distributing vegetables, which initially eliminated the above-mentioned chaos. However, this still could not stabilize vegetable prices very well. In order to seek high profits, many vendors did not buy vegetables at the wholesale market. They went directly to the homes of vegetable farmers (at that time, there were still many individual vegetable farmers in the suburbs) to buy up vegetable fields, and then waited for the price to rise. This situation naturally seriously hindered the normal supply of vegetables and affected the economic life of urban residents.

    It is very clear that only by accelerating the transformation of vegetable vendors in the vegetable supply chain can prices be further stabilized and reasonable supply be implemented. In order to carry out this work, the Municipal Vegetable Company and relevant departments conducted preliminary investigations and research. First, based on the sales capacity of vegetable retail outlets of vegetable companies, cooperatives, and established merchants in various districts, as well as the regular vegetable needs of local residents and the catering industry, the vegetable vendors were uniformly arranged and given relatively fixed supply areas. Then, the Industry and Commerce Section of each district and relevant units jointly convened meetings of vegetable vendors in their respective districts to educate them on the issue of socialist transformation, explaining the benefits of organizing and supplying by designated areas. On the other hand, the Municipal Vegetable Company and suburban vegetable production cooperatives signed exclusive sales contracts to block speculative activities. The vendors saw that taking the road of cooperation was an inevitable trend, and they all asked to be organized. From the end of December last year, within 20 days, the vast majority of the city's more than 3,000 vegetable vendors formed joint purchase and sales groups.

    At first, some group members were worried that their group would not do well, that the sales volume would not be high, and that they would not be able to maintain their livelihoods. However, facts have proved that joint purchase and sales groups have accomplished many things that could not be done when working alone.

    First, joint purchase and sales groups have strengthened planning in their operations. In the past, when vendors operated independently, there was very little planning. In order to sell the vegetables for the day, one person often pushed a cart and blindly ran all over half of Beijing, and even then sometimes they still couldn't sell them, resulting in significant losses. Now, with a guaranteed supply of vegetables and a relatively fixed operating area, the situation of vegetable backlogs and shortages has been greatly reduced.

    Second, the financial strength of joint purchase and sales groups has been enhanced. In the past, the average vendor had only five or six yuan of working capital, and the most was no more than ten yuan. With limited funds, the variety of products that could be sold was restricted, and the needs of residents could not be met. Now, with centralized use of funds, many more varieties can be added. Take the Dongguanyinsi Vegetable Joint Purchase and Sales Group in Dongdan District as an example. It now carries more than 40 varieties of vegetables. The more expensive "greenhouse vegetables" in winter, such as eggplants, sweet peppers, winter melons, and tomatoes, are all available, and there are more than three kinds of chives alone. Moreover, the price of vegetables is similar to that of the Vegetable Company. Currently, the best Chinese cabbage on the market sells for 5.3 cents per catty at the Vegetable Company, and the joint purchase and sales group sells it for only 5.5 cents. Although it is no longer possible to raise prices arbitrarily after being organized, the income of group members has not decreased due to the increase in sales volume. In the past, a vendor in Dongdan District sold a maximum of six or seven yuan per day, but after being organized, the average sales volume per person increased to fourteen or fifteen yuan.

    Faced with such facts, group members have been encouraged, and their enthusiasm for work has been unprecedentedly high. Group members in the Sanzuoqiao area of Xisi District, fearing that the vegetables would freeze in the cold weather, voluntarily took out their own quilts to cover the vegetables. The Tenth Joint Purchase and Sales Group in this district, in order to welcome the Spring Festival, started loading goods at 5 a.m. every day and went out at 7 a.m. Some group members, in order to sell more vegetables, gave up their rest time and made six or seven trips back and forth to load vegetables a day. Many groups have also established covenants to ensure that they do a good job in vegetable processing, do not give short weight, and have a friendly attitude towards customers… In short, their operating style has changed significantly. Li Rui, a resident of Maojiawan in Dongdan District, said: "Li Xida, the vegetable vendor in our area, used to give different weights to different people and charged different prices. Therefore, I rarely bought his vegetables. Since he was organized, he has changed all his previous bad habits, and his service attitude is much better. Now I look for him whenever I eat vegetables."

    What is particularly worth mentioning is that vegetable vendors have maintained and carried forward the characteristic of "going deep into the streets and alleys and delivering goods to homes" after being organized. At present, in addition to having supply points in fixed areas, joint purchase and sales groups in various districts also send out a large number of mobile vegetable carts to supply vegetables. The Gulou Joint Purchase and Sales Group sends out 20 mobile vegetable carts every day to facilitate residents' purchase of vegetables. There are more than 70 households of staff and workers' families in the East Corner Tower of the Forbidden City. Because the place is remote, the families have to run two miles to buy vegetables. In the past, if a vegetable vendor happened to pass by, they would rush to buy even if the price was very high. Now, the Dachangchang Joint Purchase and Sales Group in Dongdan District has taken the initiative to contact them and sends vegetables there every day, which is very popular with the families. Ding Guiyuan, a member of the Eighth Group in Xisi District, is responsible for selling vegetables in the area around the Front and Rear Guangping Warehouses. He proposed to "visit every household and contact every family," and often visits and contacts households to ask residents what vegetables they need and how much they need, and then delivers them to their doors the next day. Through his efforts, 227 out of 228 households in this area now buy his vegetables. Residents are generally satisfied. They said: "If you want to eat vegetables, they will be delivered to your door, and the price is fair. It really saves a lot of trouble!" "These are all the benefits of transformation."

    The vegetable joint purchase and sales groups are not satisfied with the achievements they have already made. They all said that they must cherish their organizations even more, constantly improve vegetable processing and supply services, so that residents can buy fresh and delicious vegetables more conveniently and satisfactorily.

    让居民更方便地买到蔬菜
    记北京市菜贩改造前后
    江夏
    在北京的街头巷尾，近来到处出现着插着小红旗的蔬菜联购联销小组的流动菜车。居民们都以满意的心情就近向这些菜车选购他们需要的各种鲜菜。蔬菜联购联销小组——这些带有社会主义萌芽性质的初级合作组织，不久以前还是单独经营的小菜贩。在他们组织起来以前，居民们也不像现在这样信任他们。
    居民不信任他们，不仅因为这些菜贩当中多数人都用过“少给分量多上水”等办法欺骗顾客，还因为他们经常背地里抬高菜价。就拿黄瓜来说，正常的黄瓜上市季节，只卖八九分钱一斤，要是第二天一刮风下雨，菜贩就可以把黄瓜价格抬到两角一斤。这些菜贩为了趸到利大畅销的菜，经常在批发市场上抢购，但是对利小的菜蔬则消极观望，等待落价。去年夏天小白菜、洋白菜和西红柿上市以后发生了大量积压的情况，最多的时候一天就积压了100多万斤，市菜蔬公司动员他们积极推销，但是谁也不听话，他们观望不买，等着落价，结果使大量的蔬菜白白地腐烂了。
    去年3月，北京市菜蔬公司配合有关部门曾经帮助他们组成联购分销小组（联合买菜，分散经营，自负盈亏），合理地分配菜蔬，算是初步消除了上述的混乱现象。但是，这样仍然不能很好地稳定蔬菜价格。许多菜贩为了谋取高额利润，不到批发市场买菜，他们直接跑到菜农（那时郊区个体菜农还有很多）家里把菜地包买下来，然后就待价而估。这种情况自然会严重地妨碍蔬菜的正常供应，影响城市居民的经济生活。
    事情十分明显，在蔬菜供应的环节上，只有加速对菜贩的改造，才能进一步稳定价格、实行合理供应。为了进行这一工作，市菜蔬公司和有关部门事先做了调查研究工作，首先根据分布在各区的菜蔬公司、合作社以及座商的蔬菜零售点的销售能力，以及当地居民、饮食业经常需菜的情况，将菜贩作了统一安排，给他们划定相对固定的供应范围。然后由各区工商科和有关单位联合召集本区的菜贩开会，向他们进行了关于社会主义改造问题的教育，说明组织起来划片供应的好处。另一方面，市菜蔬公司和郊区蔬菜生产合作社全部订了包销合同，堵塞了投机捣把的道路。菜贩们看到了走合作化道路已经是必然趋势，便都纷纷要求组织起来。从去年12月下旬起，在20天的时间内全市3，000多个菜贩的绝大部分都分别组成了联购联销小组。
    一开始，有些组员还担心自己的组搞不好，卖钱额不多，不能维持自己的生活。但是，事实证明，联购联销小组做到了很多过去单干的时候做不到的事情。
    首先，联购联销小组加强了经营上的计划性。以往菜贩们单独经营的时候是很没有计划的。为了把当天的菜卖完，一个人常常推着车子盲目地跑遍半个北京城，就这样有时还是卖不出去，造成的损耗也是很大的。现在由于菜源供应有了保证，并且有了相对固定的经营范围，就大大减少了蔬菜积压和脱销的情况。
    其次，联购联销小组的资金力量雄厚了，过去，一般的菜贩平均只有五、六元流动资金，最多的也不过十元。资金少，经营品种就受限制，远不能满足居民的需要。现在集中使用资金，就可以增加许多品种，拿东单区东观音寺蔬菜联购联销小组来说，现在经营的菜就在四十种以上。冬季里比较贵重的“洞子菜”如茄子、柿子椒、冬瓜、西红柿等都应有尽有，单是韭菜就有三种以上。而且菜价和菜蔬公司的价格差不多，现在市上最好的白菜每斤菜蔬公司卖五分三，联购联销小组只卖五分五。组织起来后虽然不能任意抬价了，但是由于卖钱额有了增加，组员的收入并没有减少。东单区过去一个菜贩每天最多卖六、七元，组织起来以后平均每人的卖钱额就增加到十四、五元。
    在这样的事实面前，组员们都受到了鼓舞，工作热情空前高涨。西四区三座桥的组员们因为冷天怕菜受冻，就自动把自己盖的棉被拿出来苫盖蔬菜。这个区第十联购联销小组为了迎接春节，每天早晨5点钟就装货，7点钟就出车。有的组员为了争取多卖菜，放弃自己的休息时间，一天往返装菜六、七次之多。许多小组还订了公约，保证做好菜蔬加工、不少给分量，对顾客态度和蔼……总之，经营作风有了显著改变。东单区毛家湾居民李瑞说：“我们这儿的菜贩李锡达，以前卖菜是看人给分量，看人要价，我因此很少买他的菜；自打组织起来以后，以前的毛病他都改了，服务态度也好多了，我现在一吃菜就找他。”
    特别值得提出的是，菜贩们组织起来以后仍然保持和发扬了“深入街巷，送货上门”的特点。目前各区的联购联销小组除了在固定地区内设有供应点以外，还大量出动流动菜车供应。鼓楼联购联销小组为了便利居民买菜，每天出动二十辆流动菜车。故宫东角楼有70多户职工家属，因为地方偏僻，家属们要买菜，就得跑出二里地远。过去，偶而路过一个菜贩，哪怕菜价很高也都抢着买。现在东单区大草场联购联销小组主动和这里取得联系，每天都去送菜，大受家属们欢迎。西四区八组组员丁贵元负责在前后广平库一带流动卖菜，他提出要“户户上门，家家联系”，经常去各户访问联系，头天问居民需要什么菜，需要多少，第二天就送到门上来。经过他的联系，现在这一带228户居民有227户都买他的菜了。居民们普遍感到满意，他们说：“要吃菜，就给送上门来，价钱又公道，真是省了多少心！”“这都是改造带来的好处。”
    蔬菜联购联销小组并没有满足已经取得的成绩，他们都表示一定要更加爱护自己的组织，不断改进蔬菜的加工和供应业务，好让居民们更方便更满意地买到新鲜可口的蔬菜。
