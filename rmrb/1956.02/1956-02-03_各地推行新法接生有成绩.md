Achievements in Promoting New Method Delivery Across Regions

The new method of delivery is being widely promoted in various regions, significantly reducing neonatal tetanus. Currently, in many counties, over 80% of newborns are delivered using the new method; some townships and cities have essentially eliminated the old method of delivery.

In rural areas of Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, over 80% of newborns are now delivered using the new method, and neonatal tetanus and postpartum fever in mothers have been basically eliminated. In Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, the new method of delivery has been fully implemented, and no cases of neonatal tetanus occurred throughout the past year. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the number of maternity stations (groups) has increased to 2,895. Each station (group) is equipped with a simple delivery box. In some areas, such as the Korqin Right Front Banner and Ulanhot City in Hulunbuir League, and Tongliao County in Jirem League, midwives already have a set of delivery equipment each.

    各地推行新法接生有成绩
    新法接生在各地广泛推行，新生儿破伤风显著减少。目前，许多县新生儿采用新法接生的已经达到80％以上；有的乡和城市已经基本上废除了旧法接生。
    江西省南昌县农村中现在80％以上的新生儿都采用新法接生，新生儿破伤风和产妇产褥热基本上已经消灭。湖南省湘潭县韶山乡已经完全实行新法接生，去年一年中没有发生新生儿破伤风。内蒙古自治区的接生站（组）已经发展到2，895处，每个站（组）都装备了简单的产箱，个别地区如呼伦贝尔盟的科尔沁右翼前旗和乌兰浩特市、哲里木盟通辽县等地的接生员已经每人有一套接生用具。
