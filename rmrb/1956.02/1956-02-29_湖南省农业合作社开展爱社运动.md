    Hunan Province Agricultural Cooperatives Launch "Love the Cooperative" Movement
    The Hunan Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department recently convened a provincial symposium on political work in agricultural cooperatives, proposing to launch a large-scale "Love the Cooperative" movement in agricultural cooperatives throughout the province, in conjunction with the current spring plowing production. The meeting requested that, through organizing cooperative members to study the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967, the draft agricultural development program for the province, and the draft model regulations for agricultural production cooperatives, and by using comparative education and commending good deeds, members should be educated to recognize the consistent interests of the cooperative and the family. Furthermore, on the basis of educating members to love the cooperative, labor competitions should be carried out, with regular evaluations, summaries, and commendations of model members conducted in each production stage.
    In order to strengthen leadership over political work in agricultural cooperatives, the meeting required that all agricultural cooperatives must establish political deputy positions and have dedicated personnel specifically responsible for leading the cooperative's political and ideological work. The meeting requested that this year each prefectural Party committee propaganda department must cultivate two key cooperatives for political work, and each county Party committee propaganda department must cultivate one key cooperative, with a total of 100 key cooperatives for political work to be cultivated throughout the province, in order to create experience and promptly summarize and promote it.

    湖南省农业合作社开展爱社运动
    中共湖南省委宣传部最近召开的全省农业合作社政治工作座谈会，提出要结合当前春耕生产工作，在全省农业合作社里开展一个声势浩大的爱社运动。会议要求通过组织社员学习1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）和本省农业发展纲要草案以及农业生产合作社示范章程草案，采用对比教育和表扬好人好事的方式，教育社员认识社和家的利益相一致的道理。并且在对社员进行爱社教育的基础上开展劳动竞赛，按生产段落进行经常性的评比、总结和表扬模范社员。
    为了加强对农业合作社政治工作的领导，会议要求各农业合作社都必须设立政治副职，必须有专人专职分工负责领导全社的政治思想工作。会议要求今年每个地委宣传部必须培养两个政治工作重点社，每个县委宣传部必须培养一个重点社，全省共培养100个政治工作重点社，以便创造经验，及时总结推广。（据新华社讯）
