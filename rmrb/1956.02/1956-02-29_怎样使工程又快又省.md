How to Make Engineering Projects Faster and More Economical
    Yu Ming

In the capital construction of the Huainan Coal Mine, there are two distinctly different phenomena. One is the project designed by the Soviet Union. The main project will not be constructed until next year; however, the construction drawings for auxiliary and welfare projects have already been delivered this year, and the construction of railways, highways, material warehouses, residences, and office buildings will begin immediately. When the main project starts, the construction units can utilize these permanent buildings without having to build many temporary projects. Transportation can also be greatly accelerated. This is of great benefit to accelerating the progress of the project and saving money.

The other situation is the project designed by our own country, which puts most of the auxiliary and welfare projects in the later stage of the main project, so that the construction unit cannot utilize them during the construction period and has to increase many temporary projects. This increases a large amount of expenditure for the country and reduces the progress of the project. For example, at the newly built Li Yingzi No. 2 inclined shaft of the Huainan Coal Mine, basic construction workers have to walk ladders equivalent to 70 stories high, more than 200 meters long, and with a slope of 40 degrees every day from the ground to the shaft. Many workers have no energy to work after walking to the shaft. The design of this mine originally had a passenger car facility from the ground to the shaft, but because this car was not equipped early, basic construction workers still have to rely on their own legs every day. At the construction site of the newly built Xiejiaji No. 2 and No. 3 mines, most of the materials needed for construction were transported day and night by a large number of ox carts, flatbed trucks, and automobiles before the railway leading to the mines was built.

According to the estimation of the construction unit, as long as a part of the permanent projects is built as early as possible at the construction site of Xiejiaji No. 2 and No. 3 mines, the cost of temporary projects can be saved by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan; if the railway leading to the two pairs of mines is built one year earlier, more than 200,000 yuan can be saved in transportation costs during the construction period. The acceleration of the project speed is also inevitable, because railway transportation is much more efficient than ox carts, flatbed trucks, and automobile transportation; in the case of Li Yingzi No. 2 mine, it is of course much more efficient for workers to take the passenger car to the mine for construction than to exhaust their energy on the way to the mine.

Making full use of permanent buildings in capital construction is a policy that the state has already determined. However, some places have not implemented it well. The design unit believes that the design of auxiliary projects and welfare buildings can be done slowly; the construction unit does not pay close attention to these projects, and they prefer to accept new buildings rather than accepting buildings that have been used by the construction unit. All these wrong ideas hinder the implementation of this policy. In order to make capital construction faster and more economical, this phenomenon must be eliminated.

    怎样使工程又快又省
    于明
    在淮南煤矿的基本建设中，有两种绝然不同的现象。一种是苏联设计的工程，这项工程的主要工程要到明年才施工；可是，辅助工程和福利工程的施工图纸今年已经送到，马上就要开始建筑铁路、公路、材料库、住宅和办公楼等等。在主要工程动工的时候，这些永久性的建筑，施工单位都可利用，不需要再建许多临时工程。运输也可大大加快。这对于加速工程的进度和节约都有很大好处。
    另一种情况，则是我国自己设计的工程，把大部分辅助工程和福利工程都放在主要工程的后期来建设，使施工单位在施工期间不能加以利用，不得不增加许多临时工程。这就使国家增加大量开支，降低工程的进度。例如在淮南煤矿新建的李郢孜二号斜井上，基本建设工人每天从井上到井下，要走等于70层楼高，200多公尺长，坡度达40度的梯子。许多工人走到井下以后，就没有力气工作了。这个矿井的设计里本来有从井上到井下的人行车的设备，但是因为没有及早装备这种车子，基本建设工人每天还是不得不靠自己的腿走。在谢家集二、三号新建矿井工地上，建设所需要的绝大部分物资，用大批牛车、板车、汽车日夜运送完毕以后，通往矿井的铁路才建筑起来。
    据施工单位的估计，只要在谢家集二、三号井的工地上，尽量提早建筑一部分永久工程，就可节约临时工程费用40—50万元；通往两对矿井的铁路早一年修好，就可在施工期间节省运费20万多元。工程速度的加快也是必然的，因为铁路运输比牛马、板车、汽车的运输效率要高得多；像李郢孜二号井的情况，工人坐上人行车下井建设，当然比在下井途中就耗尽了力气效率高得多。
    在基本建设中尽量利用永久性建筑，是国家早已确定的方针。可是有些地方并没有很好执行。设计单位认为辅助工程和福利建筑的设计可以慢慢来；建设单位对这些工程抓得不紧，他们喜欢接受新的建筑，不愿意接受施工单位利用过的建筑。这种种错误的思想，都妨碍这一方针的贯彻执行。为了使基本建设做到又快又省，必须消除这种现象。
