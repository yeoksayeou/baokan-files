    Lanzhou to Aganzhen Railway Spur Line Opens to Traffic

    The railway spur line from Lanzhou to the Aganzhen coal mining area has been completed and officially opened to traffic on the 5th.

    The Aganzhen coal mine is located more than 20 kilometers south of Lanzhou and is currently the largest coal mine in Gansu Province, supplying industrial and domestic coal to the Lanzhou area. In the past, the only transportation route from Lanzhou to the Aganzhen coal mine was a highway, and coal transportation relied mainly on rubber-tired carts and automobiles, which resulted in small transportation volumes and high costs. This made it difficult to meet the needs of the Lanzhou area. To address this, the state began construction of this railway in May of last year. After the train service is operational, its daily transportation volume can reach up to 6 times the original daily transportation volume.

### 兰州到阿干镇铁路专用线通车

    兰州到阿干镇铁路专用线通车
    兰州通往阿干镇煤矿区的铁路专用线已经建成，在5日正式通车。
    阿干镇煤矿在兰州以南20多公里的地方，是甘肃省目前产量最大的煤矿，它供应兰州地区的工业用煤和生活用煤。兰州到阿干镇煤矿过去只有一条公路，运输煤炭主要依靠胶轮大车和汽车，不仅运输量很小，而且成本很高。这样，就很难满足兰州地区的需要。为此，国家在去年5月间着手修建这条铁路。火车通车后，它一天的运输量最高可以达到原来每日运输量的6倍。
