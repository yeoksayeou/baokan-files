Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:

As a student attending this conference, we enthusiastically support Premier Zhou’s political report and the reports of all leading comrades with immense excitement. We deeply feel the happiness of Chinese youth growing up in the era of Mao Zedong because we not only clearly see the future but can also personally participate in this extremely great and earth-shattering socialist revolution. Participating in the struggle to change reality and being able to anticipate victory in this struggle is the greatest happiness. Only youth under the leadership of the Communist Party can grasp the future and attain this happiness.

The 286,000 students studying in colleges and universities have, in recent years, under the kind care of the Party and the government and the diligent teaching of our teachers, grown into a new generation of youth who love labor, love the working people, and are determined to contribute all their youth and wisdom to the socialist cause of the motherland. In addition to studying hard, we also organize voluntary labor in our spare time and actively carry out social service work. Many students from bourgeois families have also actively mobilized their families to accept socialist transformation. The idea of studying hard to master knowledge and dedicating everything to the great cause of building socialism has become the deep aspiration of the vast majority of students. This is the mainstream among young students.

However, there are still many problems on the road of students marching towards science. Here I will only mention two points:

First, respecting teachers and the issue of unity between new and old. This problem has improved greatly in recent years, and the overall situation is currently normal. However, some students still look down on young teachers, do not take off their hats in class, do not observe classroom discipline, and pass by teachers after class without even acknowledging them. Some young teachers, fearing the influence of bourgeois ideology, are unwilling to learn from older teachers, even mistakenly saying that older teachers are "living dictionaries" or "living file cards" that they only check when they can't find materials. This phenomenon greatly hinders the improvement of young intellectuals and is extremely harmful. Lenin taught us that "only by enriching one's mind with all the treasures of knowledge created by mankind can one become a communist." If Marx had been afraid of being influenced by bourgeois ideology and had not studied all the knowledge that mankind had acquired under the capitalist system, we probably would not have "Das Kapital." We must admit our immaturity, sincerely ask for advice from the older generation of scientists, cherish our precious cultural heritage, and resolutely learn from advanced Soviet experience. Only in this way can we become worthy successors to the older generation of scientists.

At present, the vast majority of older teachers are caring and tireless in their teaching of young people, and we will always be grateful to those who have led us into the treasure house of science. The teachers' kind and patient teaching and strict requirements will forever be engraved in our memories. However, there are also some individual teachers who are afraid of being "surpassed by their students" and are unwilling to teach young people all their skills. Now is a time when everyone's role is being brought into play, and even that is not enough to meet the needs of socialist construction. "Surpassed by their students" is a gratifying phenomenon, a sign that the younger generation is "promising." If each generation is worse than the last, then what is there to be happy about?

Second, the issue of views on all-round development. Currently, students often see all-round development as being opposed to fully developing personal strengths; caring about politics as being opposed to studying professional skills; and personal ideals that conform to the interests of the Party and the state as being confused with individualism that sacrifices the interests of the Party and the state to satisfy personal desires. This has created a strange rhetoric, as if advocating all-round development means that no one is allowed to have any personal strengths or hobbies, and everyone should have completely uniform interest in all different subjects. If one is particularly fond of a certain subject and spends a little more time on it, it is considered "not following the teaching plan, interest-ism"; if one has some ambitions and ideals in science, it becomes "arrogant and conceited"; translating a book is seen as "thinking about fame and fortune" because there is a fee. These views are wrong. If we act according to the views of these comrades, then we will only be able to cultivate "robots" instead of "living people," because living people can never be as uniform as machines.

I would like to make a request to school administrators and teachers: I hope that everyone can pay special attention to students' physical exercise and political quality. Teachers generally pay a lot of attention to students' academic performance, but they pay relatively little attention to physical education and political thought, and some individuals even still regard physical activity as something done by people with "developed limbs and simple minds," believing that "athletes" are synonymous with "bad students." Or they believe that political and ideological work is the responsibility of Party and Youth League organizations, and they are only responsible for teaching. These views will hinder the healthy growth of the younger generation. We urgently hope that schools and teachers can strengthen education for students' all-round development and actively create conditions for students' all-round development within possible conditions, such as solving the problems of students' sports venues, sports equipment, and subscribing to more newspapers for students.

Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our national students will surely be able to combine their ambitious aspirations to attack the fortress of science with their daily hard work. We must use all our strength to support the older scientists in their great struggle to raise our country's science to the advanced level of the world. Dear teachers! Around you, there are always the hot hearts of young people beating. We will unswervingly be your loyal assistants, and under the leadership of the Party, we will always move forward and plant the five-star red flag on the highest peak of advanced world science!

    胡启立的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    作为列席这次大会的青年学生，我们以无限兴奋的心情热烈拥护周总理的政治报告和各位领导同志的报告。我们深深地感到生长在毛泽东时代的中国青年的幸福，因为我们不但明确的看清了未来，并且能够亲身参加这个极其伟大的翻天复地的社会义主革命。参加变革现实的斗争，并且能预期到在这个斗争中一定取得胜利，这就是最大的幸福，只有在共产党领导下的青年才能掌握未来，才会得到这种幸福。
    我们在高等学校读书的286，000个同学，几年来在党和政府的亲切关怀和教师们的辛勤教导下，已经成长为热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民、并决心为祖国社会主义事业贡献出全部青春与智慧的青年一代。我们除了学好功课以外，还利用业余时间组织义务劳动，积极开展社会服务工作。很多资产阶级家庭出身的同学，还积极动员家庭接受社会主义改造。愿意学好功课掌握知识为建设社会主义的伟大事业献出一切的思想，已经成了广大同学的深切愿望，这是青年学生中的主流。
    但是，在同学们向科学进军的道路上却还存在着不少问题，在这里我只提两点：
    第一，尊敬师长，和新、老团结问题。这个问题几年来已经有很大的改进，目前总的情况也是正常的。但仍有些同学看不起青年教师，上课不脱帽，不守课堂纪律，下课后碰见老师连理都不理，昂然而过。有的青年教师因为怕受资产阶级思想的影响，就不愿向老教师学习，甚至错误地说老教师是“活字典”、“活卡片”找不着材料时就去查一查。这种现象很大的妨碍了青年知识分子的提高，这是十分有害的。列宁教导我们说：“只有用人类创造出来的全部知识宝藏，来丰富自己的头脑时，才能成为共产主义者”。如果马克思因为怕受资产阶级思想影响而不去研究人类在资本主义制度下所获得的全部知识时，那恐怕我们也不会有“资本论”了，我们要承认自己幼稚，要极其诚恳的向科学界的老前辈请教，要十分珍视我国宝贵的文化遗产，要坚决学习苏联先进经验，这样我们才能成为名符其实的老一辈科学家的接班人。
    现在绝大多数的老教师对青年都是关怀备至，诲人不倦的，我们将永远感谢那些把我们领进到科学宝库中的领路人。老师们亲切、耐心的教导，严格的要求，将会永远铭刻在我们的记忆之中。但是也还有个别的先生怕“青出于蓝”，不愿把自己的全部本领拿出来教给青年。现在是人人都发挥作用也还不能满足社会主义建设需要的问题，“青出于蓝”正是可喜的现象，是青年一代“有出息”的表现，如果一代不如一代，那又有什么可高兴的呢？
    第二，对全面发展的看法问题。现在同学中往往把全面发展与充分地发挥个人特长对立起来；把关心政治与钻研业务对立起来；把符合党和国家利益的个人理想，和牺牲党和国家的利益满足一己私利的个人主义混淆成一个东西。这样就造成了一种希奇古怪的言论，仿佛是提倡全面发展，就不允许有任何个人的特长和个人的爱好，任何人都应当对各种不同的功课发生完全一律的兴趣似的。如果对某一门功课有所偏爱，稍稍多用了一些时间，就是“不遵守教学计划，兴趣主义”；如果在科学上有些抱负和理想，就成了“狂妄自大”；翻译一本书，因为有稿费也成了“名利思想”。这些看法是错误的。如果按照这些同志的看法办事，那我们将只能培养出“机器人”而不是“活人”，因为活的人总是不能和机器一样千篇一律的。
    对于学校行政和教师我想提出一点要求，就是希望大家能特别注意同学的体育锻炼和政治质量。老师们对同学的学业成绩一般是很注意的，但是对体育和政治思想情况就比较忽视，甚至个别人仍旧把体育活动看成是一种“四肢发达，头脑简单”的人干的事，认为“运动员”是“坏学生”的同义语。或者认为政治思想工作由党团组织负责，我只管教书。这些看法都会妨碍青年一代的健康成长。我们迫切的希望学校和老师们能加强对学生进行全面发展的教育，在可能的条件下积极为学生的全面发展创设条件，例如解决学生的运动场地、体育设备，多给学生订阅一些报纸等等问题。
    我们全国同学在光荣的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，一定能够把向科学堡垒进攻的雄心壮志和日常的顽强劳动结合起来；我们一定要用自己的全部力量支援老科学家们为把我国科学提高到世界先进水平而作的伟大斗争。亲爱的师长们！在你们的身边永远跳动着年青人的火热的心，我们将坚持不渝的作你们的忠实助手，在党的领导下永远前进，把五星红旗插上世界先进科学的最高峰！
