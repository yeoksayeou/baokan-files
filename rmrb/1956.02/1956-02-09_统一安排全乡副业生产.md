    Unified Arrangement of Sideline Production in the Whole Township
    In Wenshui Township, Guangning County, Guangdong Province, due to the lack of comprehensive and unified arrangement, a chaotic phenomenon occurred where more than a dozen agricultural cooperatives competed with each other to engage in sideline production. Some cooperatives even stopped agricultural production to grab sideline production exclusively. This affected the normal progress of agricultural production and the rational use of labor within the cooperatives, and also affected the unity between the agricultural cooperatives.
    The Township Joint Cooperative Committee and the Party Branch held a meeting, identified the causes of this phenomenon, and criticized it. Based on the principles of benefiting production, benefiting unity, and increasing income for each cooperative, and considering the labor force situation of each cooperative, they identified various avenues for sideline production that the entire township could currently engage in and made unified arrangements for the sideline production of each agricultural cooperative. After such arrangements, the income of each cooperative increased, not only overcoming the living difficulties of some members, but also enabling the cooperatives to purchase agricultural tools and fertilizers. At the same time, it also ensured the normal progress of agricultural production.

    统一安排全乡副业生产
    广东省广宁县汶水乡，由于缺乏全面的统一的安排，曾发生十几个农业合作社相互争着搞副业生产的混乱现象，有的社甚至把农业生产停下来专门抢着搞副业。这影响了社内的农业生产的正常进行和劳动力的合理使用，同时也影响了各个农业合作社之间的团结。
    乡联社委员会和党支部召开了会议，找出了发生这种现象的原因，并给以批判；根据有利生产、有利团结、各个社都能增加收入的原则和各个社的劳动力情况，从各方面找出了当前全乡可以搞的副业生产门路，统一安排了各个农业合作社的副业生产。经过这样安排以后，各个社的收入都有了增加，不但克服了部分社员的生活困难，社里还添置了农具和肥料；同时，也保证了农业生产的正常进行。
