    Response to Criticism from this Newspaper
    On January 10th, this newspaper's article "The Spare Parts Warehouse Should Not Blindly Stock Up" criticized the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory for blindly stockpiling spare parts. Now, the factory has sent a letter of self-criticism, stating that they have instructed the dispatching section and the spare parts warehouse to actively handle the backlog of spare parts.

    对本报批评的反应
    1月10日，本报“备品库不该盲目备品”一文，批评了太原机车车辆修理工厂盲目储备配件。现在，这个厂已经来信检讨，他们已经责成调度科、备品库积极处理积压配件。
