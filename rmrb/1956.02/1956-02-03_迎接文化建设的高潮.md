    Welcoming the High Tide of Cultural Construction
    By our staff reporter Lin Gang
    Not long ago, a group of guests from Latin American countries visited Anshan Iron and Steel. Accompanying them on the tour was Yang Shutang, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chief engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. As the guests were about to leave, a Chilean friend quietly said to him, "I heard that you can't work here unless you are a Communist Party member, is that right?" Yang Shutang smiled and said, "I am the director of production here, but I am not a Communist Party member." The guests did not hide their surprise: New China entrusted the power of production of such an important enterprise to a non-Party intellectual.
    Indeed, it is so. Intellectuals are fully valued in our country. The vast majority of intellectuals with real talent and practical learning have assumed important tasks in national construction. Many have taken on work that exceeds their abilities.
    Qian Xuesen, the famous scientist who recently returned from the United States, is a member of this session of the CPPCC National Committee. After returning to China, he saw the fundamental changes in the face of Chinese intellectuals, and was deeply moved by the fact that intellectuals, under the leadership of the Party, were selflessly serving the cause of socialist construction. Xie Jialin and Li Zhengwu, returned students from the United States, also attended the meeting as observers. When these two young physicists left their motherland, domestic intellectuals were experiencing unprecedented spiritual distress. Most university graduates were not using what they had studied. Physics was a "cold subject." Some of their classmates became employees of banks or enterprises, some opened automobile shops and coal briquette shops to do business, and some were unemployed. When they arrived in the United States, they realized that honest American intellectuals were also in a state of distress, numbness, and instability. Life told them that this misfortune of intellectuals was a product of the social system. Last year, they returned to the embrace of their motherland after overcoming many difficulties. "Returning to the motherland from the United States is like running from a dark room into the sunlight." This was their common feeling. Intellectuals have infinitely broad prospects in the new motherland. The era when physics was regarded as a "cold subject" is gone forever. Talents in all fields cannot meet the needs of the vigorously developing national construction. Their former classmates all have their own jobs. Some are researchers in scientific research institutions, some are working hard to popularize science, some are model teachers, and some are engineers. Returned students from the United States have also successively taken up posts in national construction.
    The Party and the government regard intellectuals as valuable assets of the country. The enormous contributions made by intellectuals to national construction in the past six years show that they have not disappointed the people's high hopes. The large-scale exploration and development of natural resources in the motherland, the establishment of batches of new factories, the annual increase in agricultural production, the large number of outstanding students going from schools to construction posts, the lofty honors won by our national culture and art internationally... all of this embodies the hard work and wisdom of intellectuals.
    Intellectual representatives from all fields, including scientific research, education, engineering technology, health, and culture and art, came to the CPPCC session with their respective contributions. Zhao Hongzhang was originally an assistant teacher at Northwest Agricultural College. He spent a full eight years selecting and breeding the excellent wheat variety "Bima No. 1." During the Kuomintang rule, "Bima No. 1" never left the experimental garden of Northwest Agricultural College. After liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to his scientific research achievements, and the young agronomist's ideal of "handing over excellent varieties to the vast number of farmers" was realized. In 1949, "Bima No. 1" began to be promoted in his hometown of Wugong County, Shaanxi Province. Now, the excellent seeds selected and bred by Zhao Hongzhang have been sown all over Guanzhong, Longdong, Henan, southern Shanxi, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Shandong... "Bima No. 1" has greatly increased the yield per unit area. It has made a great contribution to the country's grain production and has brought a prosperous life to farmers. Honor belongs to creative labor. The people of Shaanxi Province elected him as a labor model. He is now a professor at Northwest Agricultural College and a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC. A few days ago, Zhao Hongzhang, along with many scientists and professors, was invited to attend the Supreme State Conference as an observer.
    Chairman Mao's call to catch up with the world's scientific level quickly has inspired the people of the whole country, especially the intellectuals of the whole country. It is difficult to fully describe the joy and excitement of the representatives of the intellectual circles reflected at the meeting. Shi Ruwei, an applied physicist, said: "It has been the ideal of all patriotic scientists for many years to make the scientific and technological level of the motherland catch up with the world level. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, this ideal will become a reality in a not-too-long time. I really cannot express the infinite excitement in my heart." Bao Guobao, deputy director of the Technical Committee of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, recalled an past event. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he participated in the so-called "Industrial Construction Plan Conference" held by the Kuomintang reactionary government in Chongqing. At that meeting, electrical engineering technicians proposed to increase the total power generation capacity of the country to 20 million kilowatts within 20 years. This figure reflected the ideals of many patriotic engineering technicians in the country at that time. However, until the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary government, this good-looking plan remained a dead letter. After liberation, the scale and speed of the development of the power industry exceeded any period in the history of China's electric power industry. Today, the numbers written in the plan become power stations, high-voltage power grids, and the welfare of the people. Bao Guobao said: "Twelve years later, my country's power generation capacity will far exceed the numbers we dreamed of before. What we should consider in the future is how to catch up with the world level."
    Some of our famous scientists, as well as some departments of scientific research, have already reached the world level. However, there are still many blanks and blank spots. The older generation of scientists, professors, and artists expressed that, in order to make our entire science and culture reach the world level, they must fully exert their socialist enthusiasm and shoulder the important task of cultivating new forces. Some older scientists believe that "ten years to cultivate a person" is an old concept. Under our superior socialist system, the work of cultivating new forces can also be done more, faster, better, and more economically. The famous mathematician Su Buqing told reporters that he has formulated a personal plan to personally cultivate 25 young mathematicians who have reached the world level and will be at the forefront within 12 years.
    The Party and the government are already drafting a comprehensive plan for the development of scientific research. Participants in the meeting all believed that this heralds the upcoming high tide of socialist cultural construction. The ranks of Chinese intellectuals, closely united around the Party, are about to launch a massive march towards science. Whether it is the older generation of scientists, professors, artists, or the new forces in the intellectual circles, all have expressed that they will give full play to their potential and establish merits in the cause of socialist revolution.

    迎接文化建设的高潮
    本报记者　林钢
    不久以前，有一批拉丁美洲国家的客人到鞍钢访问。陪同他们参观的，就是全国人民政协委员、鞍山钢铁公司总工程师杨树棠。在客人们将要离去的时候，一位智利朋友悄悄地向他说：“听说在你们这里不是共产党员就不能来做工，是吗？”杨树棠笑着说：“我是这里的生产处长，但是我并不是共产党员。”客人们没有掩饰自己的惊讶：新中国把这样一个重要企业的生产大权交给一个非党的知识分子。
    的确是这样。知识分子在我们国家里受到了充分的重视。绝大多数具有真才实学的知识分子，在国家建设中担负了重大的任务。许多人担负的工作超过了他们的能力。
    最近从美国归来的著名科学家钱学森是本届政协全国委员会委员。他回国以后，看到中国知识分子的面貌起了根本的变化，看到知识分子在党的领导下，都在忘我地为社会主义建设事业服务，受到很深的感动。留美归国学生谢家麟和李整武也列席了这次会议。这两位青年物理学家离开祖国的时候，国内知识分子正经历着空前未有的精神上的苦闷。高等学校毕业生大都学非所用。物理学是“冷门”，他们的同学有的成了银行或企业的雇员，有的开汽车行、煤球铺做起生意来，有的失业。他们到了美国，发觉美国正直的知识分子也是处在苦闷、麻木和不稳定的状态中。生活告诉他们，知识分子的这种厄运是社会制度的产物。去年，他们经过重重困难回到了祖国的怀抱。“从美国回到祖国，好像是从黑屋子里跑到了太阳光底下”。这是他们的共同感觉。知识分子在新生的祖国有了无限广阔的前途。物理学被看作“冷门”的年代已经一去不复返。各方面的人才都不能满足蓬勃发展的国家建设事业的需要。他们旧日的同学都有了自己的工作岗位。有的在科学研究机关当研究员，有的在努力从事科学普及工作，有的当了模范教师，有的在当工程师。陆续从美国回来的留学生，也都先后走上了国家建设的岗位。
    党和政府把知识分子看作是国家的宝贵财富。六年来知识分子在国家建设中所作的巨大贡献，表明了他们并没有辜负人民的厚望。祖国自然资源的大规模的勘察和开发，一批批新的工厂的建立，农业年年增产，大批优秀学生从学校走向建设岗位，我国民族文化和艺术在国际上获得的崇高荣誉……，所有这些，都凝结着知识分子辛勤的劳动和智慧。
    包括科学研究、教育、工程技术、卫生、文化艺术等各个方面的知识分子代表，就是带着他们各自的贡献走进政协会场来的。赵洪璋原来是西北农学院的助教。他化了整整8年的时间，选育成了小麦优良品种“碧玛一号”。国民党统治时期，“碧玛一号”始终没有走出西北农学院的实验园地。解放以后，党和政府十分重视他的科学研究成果，这位青年农学家“把优良品种交给广大农民”的理想实现了。1949年，“碧玛一号”开始在他自己的故乡陕西省武功县境内推广，现在，赵洪璋选育的优良种子已经撒遍了关中、陇东、河南、晋南、皖北、苏北、山东……。“碧玛一号”大大提高了单位面积产量，它为国家的粮食增产作了巨大的贡献，它给农民带来了富裕的生活。荣誉归于创造性的劳动。陕西省人民把他选为劳动模范。他现在是西北农学院的教授，全国人民政协委员。前几天，赵洪璋同许多科学家、教授一起，被邀请列席最高国务会议。
    毛主席关于迅速赶上世界科学水平的号召，振奋了全国人民，尤其是全国知识分子的心。很难尽述会议上反映出来的知识界代表的欢欣鼓舞的心情。应用物理学家施汝为说：“使祖国的科学技术赶上世界水平，是一切爱国科学家们多少年来的理想。现在，在毛主席的领导下，这个理想将在不太长的时间里变为现实，我确实无法表达内心无比的兴奋。”电力工业部技术委员会副主任鲍国宝忆起了一段往事。抗战期间，他曾经参加过国民党反动政府在重庆召开的所谓“工业建设计划会议”。在那次会议上，电力工程技术人员们提出要在20年内使全国发电容量达到2，000万瓩。这个数字反映了当时国内许多爱国工程技术人员的理想。但是直到国民党反动政府垮台，这份好看的计划仍然是一纸空文。解放以后，电力工业发展的规模和速度，超过了中国电业历史上的任何时期。今天写在计划上的数字，明天就变成了一个个发电站，变成了高压电力网，变成了人民的福利。鲍国宝说“：12年后，我国发电容量将远远超过从前我们梦想的数字。我们今后要考虑的，是如何赶上世界水平的问题了。”
    我国有些著名的科学家，以及科学研究的若干部门，早已达到了世界水平。但是，空白面和空白点还是很多。老一辈的科学家、教授和艺术家表示，为了使我国整个科学和文化达到世界水平，他们一定要充分发挥自己的社会主义积极性，把培养新生力量的重任担当起来。有些老科学家认为：“十年树人”已是一个旧观念，在我们优越的社会主义制度下，培养新生力量的工作也可以做得又多、又快、又好、又省。著名数学家苏步青对记者说，他已经制定了个人规划，要在12年内亲自培养出25名达到世界水平的、而且要走在第一线的青年数学家。
    党和政府已经在拟制发展科学研究的全面规划。会议参加者都相信，这预示着社会主义文化建设的高潮即将到来。紧紧地团结在党的周围的我国知识分子队伍将要向科学发动声势浩大的进军。无论是老一辈的科学家、教授、艺术家，或是知识界的新生力量，一致表示要充分发挥自己的潜力，在社会主义革命事业中建立功勋。
