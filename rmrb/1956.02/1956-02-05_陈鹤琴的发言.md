Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's political report and President Guo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of the socialist revolution. I fully agree with the reports of Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, and Committee Member Chen Boda. Recently, I read Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals at the meeting convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and I felt unspeakable joy. It further deepened my understanding of the Party's deep concern and close care for us intellectuals.

I. The Party's Trust in Intellectuals

The Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao have always trusted and valued intellectuals. As President Guo pointed out in his report: "During the period of the people's liberation struggle, a large number of intellectuals were absorbed and participated in the revolution; after the victory of the people's liberation struggle, the vast number of intellectuals had the opportunity to actively participate in the great construction of the motherland under the correct policy of unity, education, and transformation implemented by the Party."

I have had personal experience of this in the six years since liberation. In the past, I actively spread the reactionary educational theory of American pragmatist Dewey in China and blindly advocated a Chinese version of pragmatist educational thought—the so-called "living education."

After liberation, the Party still allowed me to serve successively as the president of the Teachers College of Nanjing University and the president of Nanjing Normal College, to undertake the important task of training people's teachers. At the same time, it conducted a serious criticism of my erroneous educational thinking, helping me to recognize my past mistakes and improve my ideological understanding.

Secondly, I had the opportunity to participate in various political movements and social life practices. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, I also participated in serious review work. These actual struggles have provided us with extremely profound education. The Party and the government also often consult with us on major national affairs and listen to our opinions. All of these have made me truly realize that we are the masters of the country and deeply feel the Party's trust in us intellectuals.

Therefore, my work enthusiasm is getting higher and higher. Today, although I am 64 years old, in such a happy Mao Zedong era, I feel younger and younger, I feel like I am only a 30-year-old young adult. My mood is getting more and more pleasant. I hope that I can work until I am 80 years old and see our great motherland become a prosperous and strong socialist country with a high level of culture.

Recently, the people of the whole country are heading towards socialism, and a new atmosphere has been set off everywhere. With the arrival of the high tide of the cooperative movement in rural areas, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and the cooperative movement of handicrafts in cities have also entered a new high tide. These days, I also heard Chairman Mao say at the Supreme State Council when he proposed the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft): "In about three years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed throughout the country." How exciting this is! This makes me truly feel that today's life is too meaningful, and tomorrow will be even more meaningful. So I feel that living to 80 years old is too little, and I am determined to raise my age target to 100 years old, so that I have more time to cultivate more new forces—engineers of the human soul, do more things that are beneficial to the people and society, and be lucky enough to see with my own eyes the communist society that mankind has dreamed of. I have the confidence, I have the determination, and I will definitely be able to see it. I also earnestly hope that everyone of you will be able to see this communist society that mankind has dreamed of.

II. Catching Up

As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country is developing rapidly, while the thinking and work of our intellectuals are far from keeping up with the needs of the objective situation. The task facing our intellectuals across the country today is how to give full play to their strength and catch up to meet the demands of the Party and the people for us. This is a serious but also glorious task.

To give full play to the greatest strength of our intellectuals, based on personal experience, I believe that:

First, we must study Marxism-Leninism and criticize bourgeois idealism. In the field of education, we must eliminate Dewey's reactionary pragmatist educational guiding ideology. For example, in today's universities, there is a widespread phenomenon of neglecting political orientation, teachers only managing and not guiding, and lacking comprehensive responsibility for students. In order to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao—to catch up with the world's advanced scientific and cultural level in a not-too-long time—we intellectuals must better study Marxism-Leninism and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

Second, we must rely on the Party and rely on the masses.

Our intellectuals have a common problem, that is, they are prone to arrogance. They admire Party members politically, but do not admire them professionally. They cannot listen to the opinions of the masses, and their understanding of the wisdom and strength of the masses is not enough. In their relationship with the Party, there is a certain distance. They do not say everything they know, and they do not say everything without reservation. For example, when intellectuals are together, everyone has no worries and talks about everything. When they are with Party members, the situation is different. They do not dare to express their opinions casually, and they do not dare to boldly expose their thoughts. This shows that they still lack understanding and trust in the Party. These erroneous ideas will hinder close reliance on the Party and reliance on the masses. This will affect our work and the transformation of us intellectuals.

We should rely on the leadership of the Party, better study and understand the Party's cultural and educational policies, discuss problems more with Party comrades who are primarily responsible, and be able to meet in mind and talk heart-to-heart with Party comrades, change the polite and insufficient criticism phenomenon, and strive for more help from the Party for ourselves.

Third, we must establish the idea of ​​being the masters of our own affairs. Today, in universities, many senior intellectuals bear important responsibilities. A kind of wrong thinking often hinders them from playing their due role. This is the "guest thinking," daring not to take responsibility boldly, and even feeling "having a position without power," to the point of simply passively relying on the leadership of the Party. I used to have this kind of wrong thinking. There are certainly various reasons for this wrong thinking, but from a subjective point of view, it should be said that our sense of responsibility for our work is not strong, and the idea of ​​being a true master has not yet been established.

To give full play to the role of intellectuals, we must overcome various ideas of individualism, take out the attitude of being masters of our own affairs, take responsibility boldly, and contribute all our knowledge and strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

III. A Wish

Finally, I have one more wish that I would like to express at the meeting.

Recently, I received a letter from my youngest daughter, who is a member of the Communist Youth League. She said that recently she applied to join the Party and wanted to challenge me. I have never had the courage to reply to her letter. I often think, can an old intellectual like me be a communist? I have seven children, six of whom are communists. I think I should learn more from my children. I have long had a heart to join the Party, but I originally had a 10-year plan to work hard to transform my thinking and prepare for the conditions for joining the Party during this long period of 10 years. Recently, I saw that Liu Xianzhou and Ouyang Yuqian have joined the Party, and I feel both happy and ashamed. Not long ago, I held a family meeting in Shanghai with several of my children, and I told them about my plans. The children encouraged me to move forward. They said, "Dad, you have to speed up and catch up!" I have now replied to my little daughter and accepted her challenge. I deeply believe that as long as I work hard to strive, my wish will definitely be realized.

Comrades, I want to make my guarantee here.

First, I want to systematically and diligently strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen the study of advanced Soviet experience, work hard to transform myself, give full play to my initiative and tenacity, vigorously cultivate people's teachers, and strive to quickly catch up with the world's advanced scientific and cultural level!

Second, I want to resolutely and forever follow the Communist Party closely, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and dedicate all my knowledge and strength without reservation to the cause of building socialism and communism!

    陈鹤琴的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心拥护周总理的政治报告和郭院长的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告。我完全同意李济深副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武副主席和陈伯达委员的各项报告。最近我看到了周总理在中共中央召开的会议上所做的关于知识分子问题的报告，心中有说不出的高兴，使我更进一步体会到党对我们知识分子的深切关怀和亲密爱护。
    一、党对知识分子的信任
    中国共产党和毛主席一向是信任和重视知识分子的，诚如郭院长在报告中指出：“在人民解放斗争时期，大量的知识分子曾经被吸收，参加了革命；在人民解放斗争胜利之后，广大知识分子又在党所执行的团结、教育和改造的正确政策之下，能够有机会积极参加了伟大的祖国的建设事业。”
    解放六年来，我有着亲身的体会。过去，我曾积极地在国内传布过美国杜威的实用主义反动教育学说并且盲目地提倡实用主义教育思想在中国的翻版——所谓“活教育”。
    解放后，党仍先后让我担任南京大学师范学院院长和南京师范学院院长等职，来担负起培养人民教师的重要任务。同时，对我错误的教育思想进行了严肃的批判。帮助我认识了过去的错误，提高了思想认识。
    其次，有机会让我参加了各项政治运动和社会生活实践。在镇反时，我还参加了严肃的审查工作。通过这些实际斗争，使我们受到极其深刻的教育。党和政府还经常和我们商量国家大事，听取我们的意见。这些都使我真正体会到我们是国家的主人，和深切地感到党对我们知识分子的信任。
    因此，我的工作热情越来越高，今天我虽然64了，但在这样幸福的毛泽东时代，我感觉到越来越年青，感觉到我还不过30来岁的青壮年。我的心情越来越愉快。我希望我能工作到80岁，看到我们的伟大的祖国成为一个繁荣富强，具有高度文化的社会主义国家。
    最近，全国人民奔向社会主义，到处掀起了一片新气象。随着农村中合作化运动高潮的到来，城市中的资本主义工商业的社会主义改造和手工业的合作化也进入了新的高潮。这几天，又听到了毛主席在最高国务会议上提出全国农业发展纲要（草案）的时候说：“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。”这是令人多么兴奋。这使我真正感到今天的生活是太有意义了，明天将比今天更有意义，于是我感到自己活到80岁是太少了，我决心把自己的年龄指标提高到100岁，使我有更多的时间培养出更多的新生力量——人类灵魂工程师，做更多的有利于人民和社会的事情，能幸运地亲眼睛看到人类所理想的共产主义社会。我有信心，我有决心，我一定能看到的。我也殷切地希望，你们每一个人也都能看到这个人类所理想的共产主义社会。
    二、迎头赶上
    正如周总理在报告中指出的，目前我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业正在飞跃地发展，而我们知识分子的思想和工作远远赶不上客观形势的需要。今天摆在我们全国知识分子面前的任务就是如何最充分地发挥自己的力量，迎头赶上，以适应党和人民对于我们的要求。这是一项严重的，但也是光荣的任务。
    要最充分地发挥我们知识分子的最大力量，根据个人的体会，我认为：
    第一，必须学习马克思列宁主义，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想。就教育领域来说，必须清除杜威实用主义反动教育指导思想，如今天在高等学校中，忽视政治倾向，教师管教不管导，缺乏对学生全面负责的现象，还普遍存在。为了热烈地响应党中央和毛主席的号召——在不太长的时间内，赶上世界的先进的科学文化水平，我们知识分子必须更好地学习马克思列宁主义，学习苏联先进经验。
    第二，必须依靠党，依靠群众。
    我们知识分子有一种通病，就是容易自高自大，对党员同志，政治上佩服，业务上不佩服，不能倾听群众意见，对群众的智慧和力量，认识不够。在同党的关系上，有一定的距离，没有做到知无不言，言无不尽，如知识分子在一起时，大家无所顾虑，无所不谈，同党员在一起，情况就不同了，有意见也不敢随便发表，思想也不敢大胆暴露，这说明对党还缺乏了解和信任。这些错误的思想会妨碍了紧密地依靠党和依靠群众。这样会影响了工作和我们知识分子的改造。
    我们应当依靠党的领导，更好地钻研和体会党的文教政策，多与负主要责任的党员同志商量问题，和党员同志相处，能做到思想见面，谈知心话，改变客客气气，批评不够的现象，争取党对自己更多的帮助。
    第三，我们必须建立起主人翁的思想。今天，在高等学校中，很多高级知识分子都负着重要的责任，有一种错误思想往往妨碍着发挥他们应有的作用。这就是“作客思想”，不敢大胆负责，甚至于感到“有职无权”，以至单纯地消极依赖党的领导，我过去就曾有这种错误思想。造成这种错误思想的，固然有各方面的原因，但从主观上检查，应该说是对我们工作的责任感不强，真正主人翁思想还没有建立起来。
    要充分发挥知识分子的作用，必须克服个人主义的各种思想，拿出当家作主的态度，大胆负责，把自己的全部知识和力量贡献给祖国社会主义建设事业。
    三、一个心愿
    最后，我还有一个心愿，愿意在大会上表示出来。
    最近我收到我最小的女儿的来信，她是一个青年团员，她说最近她要求入党了，要向我挑战。我一直没有勇气复她的信。我常常想，像我这样一个旧知识分子是不是能够做一个共产党员呢？我有七个子女，六个都是共产党员。我想自己应该多向儿女们学习。我早有一颗入党的心，但是我原来有一个10年打算，想在这个10年长时期内，努力改造自己的思想，准备入党的条件。最近我看到刘仙洲、欧阳予倩都入党了，心里是又高兴又惭愧。不久前，我和几个孩子在上海开了一次家庭会议，我把我心里的打算讲了出来，孩子们都鼓励我前进。他们说：“爸爸，你要快马加鞭，赶上去！”我现在已经回了信给我的小女儿，应了她的挑战。我深深地相信，只要我努力争取，我的愿望是一定能够实现的。
    同志们，我要在这里提出我的保证。
    第一，我要有系统地勤勤恳恳地加强学习马克思列宁主义，加强学习苏联先进经验，努力改造自己，最充分地发挥自己的积极性和顽强性，大力培养人民教师，为迅速赶上世界科学文化先进水平而奋斗！
    第二，我要坚决永远紧密地跟着共产党走，听毛主席的话，毫无保留地献出自己的全部知识和力量，为建设社会主义共产主义而奋斗！
