Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 22nd: Indian Ambassador to Indonesia, Tej Bahadur Sapru, on the morning of February 22nd, at a ceremony held in the Negara Palace, on behalf of the Indian government, presented medals and bonuses to five Indonesians living in the Natuna Islands, who had helped rescue survivors from the Indian plane "Kashmir Princess" which crashed due to sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's agents.

The five Indonesians are: Nusa bin Abdul Majid, Wang Sapan, and Ma Jun, all three of whom are farmers; and Sayyid Hamzah and Wang Moluoqiet, both of whom are medical workers on Sedanau Island.

Ambassador Tej Bahadur Sapru, on behalf of the Indian government, thanked the five Indonesians for their bravery and humanitarianism. He also said that the deaths of the victims "were caused by one of the most inhumane crimes committed in modern international history."

President Sukarno, in a short speech, said that he recalled the incident with deep sorrow. He said that the background to the plane crash was political. The President said that political disputes should not be resolved through inhumane sabotage or crimes, but should be resolved through peaceful means. He hoped that the Indonesian people would continue to abide by their humanitarian principles.

Those who attended the ceremony included Indonesian First Deputy Prime Minister Djanuis Sadiman, cabinet ministers, Air Force Chief of Staff Suryadarma, Jakarta Mayor Sudiro, and other senior officials.

Gan Yetao, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Zhao Zhongshi, Chinese Consul General in Jakarta, and officials from the Indian and British embassies in Indonesia also attended the ceremony.

    印度大使在雅加达举行典礼
    向五名印度尼西亚人授奖
    新华社雅加达22日电　印度驻印度尼西亚大使特雅布吉2月22日上午在内加拉宫中所举行的典礼上，代表印度政府向住在纳土纳群岛的5个印度尼西亚人赠送奖章和奖金，他们曾经帮助救护因蒋介石特务进行破坏而失事的印度飞机“克什米尔公主号”上面的幸存者。
    这5个印度尼西亚人是：努萨·宾·阿卜杜勒马吉、旺·萨潘和马俊，这3个人都是农民；赛义德·哈姆扎和旺·摩罗契特，这两个人都是塞当诺岛上的医务工作者。
    特雅布吉大使代表印度政府感谢这5个印度尼西亚人的英勇和人道主义。他并且说：受难者的死亡，“是在近代国际史中所犯下的最灭绝人性的罪行之一所造成的”。
    苏加诺总统在简短的演说中说，他是怀着深切忧伤的心情追述这个事件的。他说，飞机坠毁事件的背景是政治性的。总统说，政治纠纷不应当通过非人道的破坏或罪行来解决，而应当通过和平的方法来解决。他希望印度尼西亚人民继续遵守他们的人道主义原则。
    参加典礼的有印度尼西亚第一副总理贾努伊斯马迪、各部部长、空军参谋长苏里亚达马、雅加达市长苏迪罗和其他高级官员。
