Comrades!

    First of all, please allow me to convey to the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, our entire party, the Italian working class, and all democratic and progressive people in our country, our warm, fraternal congratulations on the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    Today in Italy, as in all parts of the world, not only communists, but also millions of non-communist workers are watching and concerned about your congress. Your achievements fill their hearts with hope and confidence. They know that your decisions are a new and outstanding contribution by your great party to the ultimate victory of the cause of the laboring people's liberation from capitalist exploitation and oppression, and to the victory of democratic peace.

    Your congress has aroused deep and growing concern among all strata of society and the broadest people who have not yet accepted our ideas and joined our cause. These strata and people are increasingly clear that it is necessary to seek a new way out of the current situation, which is increasingly bleak, difficult, and full of threats and dangers to the people, to our country's independence and future.

    Your congress has also alarmed our various enemies.

    In Italy, and I think this view is common in many other European countries, the current time is of decisive significance for the further development of the domestic and international situation. Both friends and enemies recognize that achievements have been made in easing international tensions. However, the question is: Will these achievements be consolidated and developed, or will the danger of the "Cold War" become more acute, and will new dangers emerge? On the other hand, expectations for change are growing within our country. This change will improve our domestic situation, strengthen democracy, and improve the living standards of the laboring people. There is a widespread public opinion that if we do not want Italy to be dominated by an openly reactionary regime again, then the political policies that the country has pursued so far must be changed. This change is possible and very necessary.

    The political forces that have ruled Italy in the past few years have acted in the interests of the ruling groups of monopoly capital and foreign imperialists. The main thing they care about, and indeed the only thing, is to obstruct the working class and the progressive elements among the laboring people and their representatives from managing the country.

    In order to achieve this goal, they try to spread an absurd fear of socialism and communism. Therefore, they have conducted and are conducting a despicable campaign to slander socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union.

    Our country has experienced years of intense economic and political conflict.

    Today, the basic issues concerning the development of our economy and the improvement of the people's living standards remain unresolved. At the same time, Italy's participation in the aggressive Atlantic Group makes it impossible to adopt an independent foreign policy that is in line with national interests, and brings heavy burdens to our people, threatens our country's independence, and unacceptably restricts our country's sovereignty. In this context, it is understandable why more and more Italians not only advocate a political shift to the left, lose confidence in the old economic and social order, but are also working to achieve a profound transformation of the country's economic institutions. They believe that this transformation must be achieved within the framework of political democracy. We believe that this is feasible if this demand is supported by a people's movement that includes people of various political persuasions. Even within the Catholic community, which is very influential and numerous in Italy, people often loudly condemn the capitalist system because it cannot guarantee freedom to the people, nor guarantee that their dignity is respected, nor guarantee welfare and peace.

    In this situation, which is happening in our country and reflects the current situation of the entire capitalist world, we are particularly clear about the historical significance of your congress and the resolutions it makes.

    You have presented the world with a list of your victories, which are the victories of socialism. These victories illustrate the decisive economic superiority of the new system over the old, decadent capitalist system.

    You have proclaimed to the world the results of the struggle for international reconciliation, for peaceful coexistence between countries, and for the persistent victory of peace, which is the highest happiness for people who are disturbed today by the danger of a new war, including the means of atomic destruction.

    The method you used in discussing the problems you face and the courageous criticism of the shortcomings in your work are examples of true democracy that puts the interests of the people in the highest position.

    The significance of your Sixth Five-Year Plan is so great that it is difficult for us to fully estimate it now. The significance of this plan lies not only in the quantitative indices and the industrial production estimates that surprise experts and exceed the imagination of ordinary people; not only in the fact that the completion of the new five-year plan will make the Soviet Union the leader in the world's economic and technological progress.

    Its significance lies in the fact that people all over the world regard this plan as a peace plan. The solution of problems reflected in the plan, such as reducing the working day to 7 hours and 6 hours without reducing wages and increasing real wages by 30%, will greatly improve the situation of the working class, create conditions for the further all-round development of the laboring people, make them more aware that they are the masters of their own future, and increase their sense of self-esteem. On the other hand, in our country, a "plan" has been drawn up that, under the pretext of preventing unemployment, stipulates that wages will be frozen for 10 years.

    Your congress, based on irrefutable words based on facts and actions, based on the achievements already made and planned, once again calls on the laboring people of the world to unite and strive to liberate mankind from the shackles of capitalism and imperialism, to unite under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and to advance heroically and fearlessly along the path you have taken in building a socialist society while adhering to Lenin's theory.

    Comrades, we fully understand that the path you have taken in seizing power and building a socialist society does not have to be followed in every aspect by other countries, and this path may and must have its own characteristics in each country.

    We are faced with the task of devising a road for Italy. This must take into account the historical development of our country, its social structure, the sentiments and aspirations of the broad masses of laboring people, and their organizations.

    This road must enable us to build an alliance of the working class, peasants, and middle strata in a form suitable to our country, so as to win the participation of the majority of the people in the cause of socialist transformation of society.

    At the same time, we understand that this transformation is impossible without constant, tenacious, and even sharp struggles against reactionary forces, to defend the vital interests of the people, and to defend peace. However, we advocate carrying out this struggle on a democratic basis, within the developed forms of the workers' movement and the democratic movement, because, as Comrade Khrushchev said, we do not advocate the use of violence at any time and under any circumstances.

    After the fascist regime was overthrown during the Great War thanks to the efforts of the most outstanding children of our people and the armed struggle carried out by patriots, we have been moving forward and fighting on a democratic basis for more than 10 years. We have always strived to adhere to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, and strived to maintain close ties with the people, with the laboring people of all strata in factories, rural areas, organs, and schools. We have always strived to understand the aspirations, hopes, and vital needs of the masses and to satisfy them. It is precisely because of this that it has enabled us to build a strong party, deeply rooted in the working class, the peasants, and the entire people, after 20 years of underground work and two years of guerrilla warfare.

    Our party, including youth organizations, has 2.5 million members, of whom 500,000 are women. The party conducts a re-registration of members once a year. This year, more than 90% of the members have re-registered. In this movement, more than 100,000 new members joined the party, and 40,000 new members joined the Communist Youth League.

    Our strength and our growth naturally frighten the enemies of peace and social progress—they are trying to offset our growing influence. This is why the foundation of political democracy on which we act is still unstable. This is determined by our struggle. The monopolists and reactionary groups in the ruling camp are using various methods to restrict or abolish democratic freedoms, prevent the people from expressing their will, and insist on respecting their will.

    For this purpose, they have adopted various methods—from electoral laws that distort election results to various pressures, deceptions, and political hostility.

    Therefore, in capitalist countries, democratic rights and political democracy can only be exercised to the extent that the masses of the people can insist on and maintain them with their own strength and activities. But it is clear that under the current international and domestic conditions, the victory of this struggle may create a situation in which a truly democratic majority capable of implementing serious social reforms and pursuing a policy of peace will emerge in the parliament itself. It is also clear that the Italian people will be able to make greater and greater contributions to the cause of easing international tensions and consolidating peace as the activities of the masses of the people and all those who fight for peace develop and strengthen.

    We have a difficult struggle ahead. We are faced with a cruel and insidious enemy. To defeat this enemy, we must make more efforts in all aspects of our activities—in political and organizational work, in propaganda and agitation work, in ideological work and trade union struggles. But we believe that our struggle will be victorious because we believe in the Italian people, we believe in their consciousness and strength, and we believe in their future.

    The Italian working class has made great progress in achieving its unity. This is mainly reflected in the fraternal cooperation between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. This cooperation has developed in the common struggle for freedom and peace for more than 20 years. It has reduced the possibility of the emergence of a reactionary social democratic movement to a minimum and has given the workers' movement the prestige and ability to spread its influence in other strata.

    We believe that within the parties that are now against us, such as the Social Democratic Party and the Catholic Democratic Party, a force will emerge that will recognize, following the people's movement, the need to abandon the stupid and rude anti-communist conspiracy made by the United States and not made by the United States, and to face reality. Then, they will see that we are a great and important force serving peace, democracy, and socialism.

    We are fighting for the noblest goals that mankind has already set for itself. Everyone who values labor, democracy, and peace above all else can and must make his contribution to achieving these goals. We will do everything necessary to unite more closely the people in Italy who are fighting for social progress, who hope to consolidate the democratic system, and who want to save the democratic system and national independence and future, so as to establish understanding and cooperation among us.

    Due to the growing influence of the socialist and peace camp, due to our efforts, the efforts of our brother socialist parties and all truly democratic people, and due to the increasingly powerful popular movements, it has become a concrete and practical possibility to establish a broad popular movement that unites people and groups with different tendencies to engage in joint action to re-adjust our entire political life.

    If we can achieve this, we will make a great contribution to the cause of democracy and peace. Comrades! Here, at your congress, we are even more convinced that our cause, the cause of socialism, is invincible. We want to give this confidence to our workers, peasants, cultural workers, and all ordinary people who hope to live in a better world. We want to guide them to participate in the struggle for such a better world. We want to consolidate the ranks of the laboring people who are uniting under the banner of socialism. Long live the international unity of the laboring people and the people of all countries in the struggle against capitalism and imperialism! Long live the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! Long live the victory of peace and socialism throughout the world! (Togliatti's speech was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause) (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th, TASS)

### 陶里亚蒂在苏共代表大会上的贺词

专栏：

    陶里亚蒂在苏共代表大会上的贺词同志们！
    首先请允许我转达意大利共产党中央委员会、我们整个党、意大利工人阶级和我国人民中的全体民主和进步人士对苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    今天在意大利，正如在全世界各地一样，不仅仅是共产党人，而且千千万万的非共产党工人也都注视和关切你们的代表大会。你们的成就使他们的内心充满着希望和信心。他们知道，你们的决定是你们伟大的党对劳动人民从资本主义剥削和压迫下求得解放的事业的最后胜利、对民主和平的胜利的新的杰出的贡献。
    你们的大会引起了社会各阶层和还没有接受我们的思想和参加我们的事业的最广泛的人们的深切的、越来越大的关心。这些阶层和人们日益清楚地知道，有必要从一个新的方向寻找一条摆脱对人民、对我们祖国的独立和未来越来越暗淡、困难和充满威胁和危险的目前局面的出路。
    你们的大会还使我们的各式各样的敌人为之惊慌失色。
    在意大利，并且我认为在欧洲其他许多国家中普遍有这样一种见解：现在这个时候对于国内和国际局势的进一步发展有着决定性的意义。不论是朋友或是敌人都承认在缓和国际紧张局势方面已经取得了成就。但是，问题是：这些成就是否将得到巩固和发展，或者是“冷战”的危险是否将变得更加尖锐，而且将出现新的危险呢？另一方面，在我们国家内，人们对于发生变革的期望正在增长。这种变革将要改善我们国内情况、加强民主和提高劳动人民的生活水平。有这样一种广泛的舆论：如果我们不愿意意大利再次受到一个公开的反动政权的支配的话，那么，这个国家迄今所奉行的政治方针就必须予以改变。这种改变是可能的，并且是非常必要的。
    在过去几年中统治着意大利的政治势力，按垄断资本统治集团和外国帝国主义者的利益行事。他们所关心的主要事情以及实际上唯一的事情是阻挠工人阶级以及劳动人民中的进步人士和他们的代表管理国家。
    为了达到这一目的，他们设法散布对社会主义和共产主义的一种荒谬的恐惧。因此，他们便进行了并且正在进行着一种诬蔑社会主义国家、特别是苏联的卑鄙运动。
    我国经历了经济上和政治上的激烈冲突的年代。
    今天情况是这样的，关于发展我们的经济和改善人民的生活水平的基本问题仍然没有得到解决。同时，意大利参加侵略性的大西洋集团的做法使它不能采取符合民族利益的独立的外交政策，并且为我们的人民带来了沉重的负担，威胁着我们国家的独立，不能容许地限制着我们国家的主权。在这种情况下，人们可以理解，为什么越来越多的意大利人不但主张在政治上向左转，对旧的经济和社会秩序丧失信心，而且正在为实现国家的经济机构的深刻的改造而努力。他们认为这种改造必须在政治民主的范围内实现。我们认为这是可行的，如果这种要求得到包含各种不同政治倾向的人的人民运动支持的话。甚至在意大利国内很有影响并且数目很多的天主教团体内部，也经常有人大声谴责资本主义制度，因为它既不能保证人民得到自由，也不能保证他们的尊严受到尊重，不能保证福利和和平。
    在我们国家发生的并且反映出整个资本主义世界目前情况的这种局势中，我们特别清楚地认识到你们的代表大会和它作出的决议的历史意义。
    你们向全世界提出了一张载明你们取得的胜利、也就是社会主义取得的胜利的清单。这些胜利说明了新制度在经济上对旧的腐朽的资本主义制度具有决定意义的优越性。
    你们向全世界宣告了争取国际和解、争取各国和平共处、争取和平的坚持不懈的胜利的斗争的结果，而和平是今天对包括原子毁灭手段的新战争的危险感到不安的人们的最高幸福。
    你们在讨论你们面临的问题时候所用的方法和对于你们工作中的缺点的勇敢批评，是把人民的利益放在最高地位的真正民主的一个范例。
    你们的第六个五年计划的意义是这样重大，我们现在很难全面估计它。这个计划的意义不仅在于量上的指数和使专家们大吃一惊并且超乎普通人民的想像的工业生产估计数字；不仅在于新五年计划的完成将使苏联在世界的经济和技术进步方面居于首位这一事实。
    它的意义在于，全世界人民都认为这个计划是一个和平计划。计划中所反映的像把工作日减少到7小时和6小时而不减少工资和把实际工资增加30％这样一些问题的解决将大大改善工人阶级的境况，将为劳动人民的进一步的全面发展创造条件，将使他们更加清楚地意识到他们是自己的未来的主人，并且将增加他们的自尊感。另一方面，在我们的国家内，却拟订了这样一个“计划”，这个计划拿防止失业作借口，规定把工资冻结10年。
    你们这次代表大会，依据有事实和行动作根据的无可辩驳的言语，依据已经取得的和计划中的成就，再一次地号召全世界劳动人民联合起来，争取从资本主义、帝国主义的枷锁中解放人类，号召他们团结在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，号召他们顺着你们在信守着列宁的理论建成社会主义社会的过程中曾经走过的那条道路英勇无畏地前进。
    同志们，我们完全了解：你们在取得政权和建设社会主义社会的时候所走过的道路，其他国家并不是必须在各个方面都照样走的，这条道路在每一个国家可能而且必须有它自己的特色。
    我们面临着策划出意大利的一条道路的任务。这就必须考虑到我们国家的历史发展，它的社会结构，广大劳动群众的情绪和愿望以及他们的组织。
    这条道路必须使得我们有可能以适合于我们国家的形式建成工人阶级、农民和中等阶层的联盟，从而争取大多数人民参加对社会进行社会主义改造的事业。
    同时，我们了解：这种转变是不可能不经过反对反动势力，保卫人民切身利益，保卫和平的经常的、顽强的甚至是尖锐的斗争而实现的。可是，我们主张在民主的基础上，在工人运动和民主运动的经过发展的形式以内展开这种斗争，因为，赫鲁晓夫同志说得好，我们并不是主张在任何时间和在任何情况下都使用暴力的。
    在大战期间由于我国人民最优秀的儿女的努力，由于爱国者进行的武装斗争而推翻了法西斯政权以后，我们已经在10年多的时间内在民主的基础上向前迈进，并且进行斗争。我们一向努力信守马克思列宁主义的教导，努力同人民，同在工厂、农村、机关和学校中的各阶层劳动人民保持巩固的联系。我们一向努力了解群众的愿望、希望和切身需要，并且使他们获得满足。正是因为这样，才使我们有可能在20年的地下工作和两年的游击战争以后，建成一个强大的，在工人阶级、农民和全体人民中间深深扎下了根的党。
    我们的党，包括青年组织在内，有250万党员，其中有50万是妇女。党每年进行一次党员重新登记。今年90％以上的党员都重新登记了。在这个运动中，有10万多新党员参加了党，4万新团员参加了共产主义青年团。
    我们的力量和我们的成长自然使和平和社会进步的敌人感到恐惧——他们竭力想抵消我们的越来越大的影响。这就是我们赖以行动的政治民主的基础还不稳固的原因。这是由我们的斗争决定的。统治阵营的垄断资本家和反动集团正在运用种种办法来限制或者取消民主自由，不让人民表达他们的意志，还坚持要求尊重他们的意志。
    为了这个目的，他们采用了种种办法——从歪曲选举结果的选举法到各种压力、欺骗和政治上的敌视。
    因此，在资本主义国家中，民主权利和政治民主只能行使到人民群众能够用他们自己的力量和活动来坚持和维护它们的程度。但是很明显的，在目前的国际和国内条件下，这个斗争的胜利可能造成这样一种局势，就是在议会本身中会出现一个能够实行认真的社会改革和奉行和平政策的真正民主的多数。同样明显的是，意大利人民将能够随着人民群众和所有为和平奋斗的人们的活动的发展和加强而对缓和国际紧张局势的事业和对巩固和平作出越来越大的贡献。
    我们前面还有一场艰巨的斗争。我们面临着一个残酷的，阴险的敌人。为了打败这个敌人，我们必须在我们的活动的各个方面——在政治工作和组织工作方面、在宣传和鼓动工作方面、在思想工作和工会斗争方面——作更多的努力。但是我们相信我们的斗争是会得到胜利的，因为我们相信意大利人民，我们相信他们的觉悟和力量，相信他们的前途。
    意大利工人阶级在实现它的团结方面取得了很大的进展。这主要反映在共产党和社会党之间的兄弟般的合作上。这种合作在20多年来的争取自由和和平的共同斗争中得到了发展，它使出现一个反动的社会民主运动的可能性减少到了最小限度，给了工人运动以在其他阶层中散布它的影响的威信和能力。
    我们相信，现在反对我们的政党，例如社会民主党和天主教民主党内部，将出现一种力量，这种力量将继人民运动之后认识到抛弃美国制造的和非美国制造的愚蠢粗卤的反共勾当和正视现实的必要性。那时，他们将看到，我们是为和平、民主和社会主义服务的一支伟大的重要的力量。
    我们正在为人类已经为自己规定的最崇高的目的而奋斗。每一个首先珍视劳动、民主和和平事业的人都能够而且必须为达到这些目标而作出他的贡献。我们将做一切必要的事情使意大利的为社会进步而斗争的人们，希望巩固民主制度、拯救民主制度和民族独立和前途的人们更加紧密地团结起来，以便在我们之间建立了解和合作。
    由于社会主义和和平阵营的越来越强大的影响，由于我们的努力，我们的兄弟社会党人以及一切真正民主的人士的努力，由于日益强大的人民群众运动，要建立一个把具有不同倾向的人们和团体团结在一起从事联合行动来重新调整我们的全部政治生活的广泛的人民运动，已经成为一种具体而切实可行的可能性了。
    能实现了这一点，我们就会对民主与和平的事业作出巨大的贡献。同志们！在这里，在你们的代表大会上，我们已经更加确信我们的事业，社会主义的事业是不可战胜的。我们要使我们的工人、农民、文化工作者和一切希望生活在一个更加美好的世界中的普通人民也都有这种信心。我们要引导他们参加到争取这样一个更加美好的世界的斗争中去。我们要巩固正团结在社会主义的旗帜周围的劳动人民的队伍。劳动人民和各国人民在反对资本主义和帝国主义的斗争中的国际大团结万岁！苏联共产党第二十次代表大会万岁！和平和社会主义在全世界范围内胜利万岁！（陶里亚蒂的发言一再被暴风雨般的掌声所打断）（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科18日电）
