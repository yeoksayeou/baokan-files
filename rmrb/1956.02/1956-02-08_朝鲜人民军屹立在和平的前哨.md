    The Korean People's Army Stands Guard on the Peace Front
    General of the Korean People's Army Cui Zhongxue
    February 8th this year marks the 8th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. The Korean people, who are struggling for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and for the construction of socialist foundations in the northern part of the Republic, are celebrating the birthday of their just armed forces with new labor achievements.
    Since the northern half of our country was liberated from Japanese imperialist colonial rule with the help of the great Soviet army, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, have established a true people's regime. Based on the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, the Party and the government, in order to defend the victorious achievements of the revolution and to strive for the freedom and independence of the fatherland, established the true armed force of the Korean people—the Korean People's Army in 1948.
    The Korean People's Army is a true people's army composed of the advanced working class, peasants, and outstanding sons and daughters of the laboring people of our country.
    The sacred mission of the Korean People's Army is to defend the independence and freedom of the country, to protect the people's democratic system established in our country, to protect the people's happy life, and to fight for peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, the Korean people and the People's Army are closely linked together by the commonality of their aims and interests. Their relationship is an inseparable blood-and-flesh relationship.
    Our People's Army is distinctly different from the armies of capitalist countries. In our People's Army, there are no class contradictions between officers and soldiers. Their goals and aspirations to serve the motherland and the people are completely consistent, forming a strong and united whole.
    Our People's Army is an army that has inherited the glorious revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese guerrilla struggle of the respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung. It is an army composed of his patriotic fighters as its backbone. Marshal Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese guerrillas waged a long and brutal struggle against the Japanese imperialists for 15 years for the freedom and honor of our nation. The revolutionary patriotic tradition of the anti-Japanese guerrillas constantly inspires the officers and soldiers of our People's Army, making the People's Army grow into a revolutionary team like a bronze wall and an iron wall, filled with infinite love for the motherland and infinite hatred for the enemy.
    Our People's Army is an army cultivated with the internationalist spirit of friendship, which safeguards the interests of peace-loving people around the world, and it is an army that constantly enriches itself with the rich combat experience of the advanced Soviet army.
    The noble patriotism and inexhaustible source of collective heroism of our Korean People's Army lie in these characteristics of our army.
    Since its birth, the Korean People's Army has been following the most glorious path of struggle.
    The power of our People's Army was fully demonstrated in the three-year Fatherland Liberation War. In this war, we repelled the attacks of the combined forces of the American imperialists, equipped with modern technology, and their 16 satellite countries, as well as the Li Seung-man bandit gang.
    During the Fatherland Liberation War, the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army overcame all difficulties, contributed their blood, and finally defended the sacred and inviolable motherland, gloriously fulfilling their sacred mission.
    The great victory achieved by the Korean People's Army completely shattered the American imperialist's aggressive plan to annex Korea in one fell swoop through a sudden invasion, severely hit the aggressive army of the United States, which boasted of being the "strongest country in the world," and caused the United States to suffer an irretrievable and shameful defeat politically and morally.
    The heroic struggle waged by the Korean People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers has made a great contribution to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.
    The victory achieved by the Korean people and the People's Army in the Fatherland Liberation War proved the political and ideological unity achieved by the Korean people under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and the respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the superiority and great power of our people's democratic system, and proved the greatness of proletarian internationalism.
    The people of the socialist camp countries, headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, gave our people tremendous spiritual and material support and assistance.
    After the war, a struggle to heal the wounds of war and restore and develop the national economy unfolded in the northern half of our Republic. The task of the Korean people is to strengthen the revolutionary democratic base politically, economically, and militarily in order to guarantee the realization of the task of peacefully unifying the fatherland.
      The Three-Year Plan for the Rehabilitation and Development of the People's Economy after the war is being smoothly implemented under the correct leadership of the Party, the government, and the respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, and great results have been achieved.
    In 1955, the total industrial output value of state-owned and cooperative-run industries completed 106% of the plan. Many factories and enterprises had completed or overfulfilled the tasks of the People's Economic Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule by the end of 1955. The total agricultural output in 1955 also significantly exceeded the level of 1954. Socialist transformation is being successfully carried out in the countryside. At present, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives has reached 60% of the total number of peasant households in the northern half of the Republic. In front of the battle-tested Korean People's Army lies a very important and glorious task. That is: to defend the revolutionary democratic base defended by the Korean people with blood, to protect the brilliant achievements of the restoration and construction of the people's economy after the war, and to ensure the realization of the peaceful reunification and independence of the fatherland.
    The struggle to defend the revolutionary democratic base—the northern half of the Republic—is inseparable from the cause of strengthening the People's Army.
    The officers and soldiers of the People's Army are unremittingly conducting combat training in a tense combat posture, and continue to victoriously defend the sacred territory of our motherland. At the same time, all officers and soldiers of our People's Army have deeply studied and learned the resolutions and documents of the Central Committee plenums of the Korean Workers' Party, further strengthened the Marxist-Leninist class education, and cultivated themselves to become ardent revolutionary fighters.
    Today, the deepest desire of the people of all countries in the world is the desire for peace.
    Due to the vigorous struggle of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the current international situation has eased to a certain extent. But the imperialists ignore the wishes of the people around the world and continue to implement the infamous "policy of strength." Disregarding the lessons of failure on the Korean battlefield, the American imperialists are still instigating their running dog, the Li Seung-man bandit gang, in the southern half of our country to frantically prepare for a new war. They concluded the so-called "ROK-US Mutual Defense Treaty," violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, and are frantically and openly preparing for war in order to carry out another military adventure. Under the vicious aggressive slogan of "Asians fighting Asians," the United States is frantically expanding the Li Seung-man puppet army.
    It is estimated that the Li puppet army had a total of 16 divisions during the war. Now it has increased to 21 divisions, plus 10 reserve divisions, the Li puppet army now has a total of 31 divisions.
    Under the colonial plunder of the United States and the bloody rule of the Li bandit gang, the industrial and rural economy of South Korea has been devastated. The South Korean people are groaning under the reign of terror.
    This war policy of the American imperialists and the Li Seung-man bandit gang has been resolutely opposed by the South Korean people, which is by no means accidental. Because the South Korean people have further recognized the correctness of the policies of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, and have more deeply realized that only the road of peaceful reunification of the fatherland is the only way to safeguard the people's true freedom and rights.
    In order to realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, which is the unanimous desire of all the Korean people, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government have repeatedly put forward sincere and concrete proposals to the South Korean authorities. However, the Li Seung-man bandit gang answered our legitimate proposals with the cliches of "unification by marching north."
    However, experience has proved that the people and their army who are waging a just struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland are invincible by any aggressive forces.
    The officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, who have valiantly defended the freedom and independence of the motherland, will fight more resolutely to defend the motherland and the people and the victorious achievements they have won.
    The Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, in order to further strengthen the construction and power of the motherland, will continuously learn advanced experience from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, will unite more closely under the banner of the great proletarian internationalism, and will always move forward by leaps and bounds.

    朝鲜人民军屹立在和平的前哨
    朝鲜人民军上将　崔钟学
    今年2月8日，是朝鲜人民军建军8周年纪念日。正在为祖国的和平统一、为在共和国北部建设社会主义基础而斗争的朝鲜人民，以新的劳动成就庆祝自己正义的武装力量的生日。
    自从我们祖国的北半部依靠伟大的苏联军队从日本帝国主义的殖民地统治下获得解放以后，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下，建立了真正的人民政权。党和政府根据马克思列宁主义的教导，为了保卫革命的胜利成果，为争取祖国的自由独立，于1948年建立了朝鲜人民真正的武装——朝鲜人民军。
    朝鲜人民军是由我国的先进的工人阶级、农民和劳动人民的优秀儿女组成的真正的人民的军队。
    朝鲜人民军的神圣使命，就是捍卫国家的独立和自由，保卫在我国建立的人民民主制度，保卫人民的幸福生活，并为远东和世界的和平而斗争。因此，朝鲜人民和人民军队是以他们的目的和利害关系的共同性紧密地联在一起的。他们的关系是不可分离的血肉关系。
    我们的人民军队和资本主义国家的军队截然不同。我们的人民军队，在官兵之间没有阶级对立的矛盾，他们为祖国和人民服务的目的和志向完全一致，是一个坚强团结的整体。
    我们的人民军队是继承了敬爱的领袖金日成元帅抗日游击斗争的光辉的革命传统的军队，是以他的爱国斗士为骨干而组成的军队。金日成元帅的抗日游击队，为了我们民族的自由和荣誉，同日本帝国主义者进行了15年的长期的残酷斗争。抗日游击队的革命的爱国传统不断地鼓舞着我们人民军将士，使人民军成长成为充满着对祖国的无限热爱和对敌人的无限憎恶的铜墙铁壁般的革命队伍。
    我们的人民军队是以维护全世界和平人民的利益的国际主义的友爱思想而培养出来的军队，是以先进的苏联军队的丰富的战斗经验不断充实自己的军队。
    我们朝鲜人民军的高尚的爱国主义和集体英雄主义的无穷无尽的源泉就在于我们军队的这些特点。
    朝鲜人民军自诞生以来一直走着最光荣的斗争道路。
    我们人民军的威力在三年祖国解放战争中得到了充分的表现。在这次战争中，我们击退了以现代技术装备起来的美国帝国主义者及其16个仆从国家军队所组成的联合部队和李承晚匪帮的进攻。
    在祖国解放战争中，朝鲜人民军将士们克服了一切困难，贡献了自己的鲜血，终于捍卫了神圣不可侵犯的祖国，光荣地完成了自己的神圣使命。
    朝鲜人民军所取得的伟大胜利，彻底粉碎了美帝国主义企图以突然的侵犯一举吞并朝鲜的侵略计划，严重地打击了自吹为“世界最强国”美国的侵略军队，并使美国在政治上和道义上遭到了无可挽回的可耻的惨败。
    朝鲜人民军和兄弟的中国人民志愿军所进行的英勇斗争，在维护远东和世界和平方面作出了巨大贡献。
    在祖国解放战争中，朝鲜人民和人民军所取得的胜利，证实了朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的领导下取得的政治思想上的统一和我国人民民主制度的优越性及其强大力量，并证实了工人阶级国际主义的伟大。
    以伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国为首的社会主义阵营各国人民给了我国人民精神上和物质上的莫大支持和援助。
    战后，在我们共和国北半部展开了医治战争创伤、恢复和发展国民经济的斗争。朝鲜人民的任务，就是要从政治、经济和军事上加强革命的民主基地，以保证和平统一祖国任务的实现。
      战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划在党和政府及敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的正确领导下，正在顺利地执行，并已取得了巨大成果。
    1955年国营和合作社营工业总产值计划完成了106％。许多工厂和企业已在1955年年底提前完成或超额完成了人民经济3年计划任务。1955年农业总产量也显著地超过了1954年的水平。农村中正在成功地进行着社会主义改造。目前，参加农业生产合作社的农户已达共和国北半部农户总数的60％。在久经战斗考验的朝鲜人民军面前，摆着十分重大的光荣任务。这就是：捍卫朝鲜人民用鲜血保卫住的革命的民主基地，保卫战后人民经济恢复和建设的辉煌成果，并保证祖国和平统一和独立的实现。
    捍卫革命的民主基地——共和国北半部的斗争，是同加强人民军队的事业分不开的。
    人民军官兵们毫不松懈地经常以紧张的战斗姿态进行着战斗训练，继续胜利地捍卫着我们祖国的神圣领土。同时，我们人民军全体官兵深刻地研究并学习了朝鲜劳动党中央委员会各次全体会议的决议和文献，进一步加强了马克思列宁主义的阶级教育，培养自己成为热烈的革命斗士。
    今天，世界各国人民最深切的愿望就是和平的愿望。
    由于以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的有力斗争，目前的国际局势已有了一定的缓和。但是帝国主义者却忽视全世界人民的愿望，仍在继续执行着臭名远扬的“实力政策”。美帝国主义者不顾在朝鲜战场上的失败教训，仍旧在我们祖国的南半部嗾使其走狗李承晚匪帮疯狂地准备着新的战争。他们缔结了所谓“韩美共同防御条约”，破坏朝鲜停战协定，为重新作一次军事冒险而疯狂露骨地进行着战争准备。在“亚洲人打亚洲人”的凶恶的侵略的口号下，美国正在疯狂地大力扩充李承晚傀儡军队。
    据估计，李伪军在战时共有16个师。而现在已增加到了21个师，加上10个预备师，李伪军现已共计有31个师的兵力。
    在美国的殖民掠夺和李匪帮的血腥统治下，南朝鲜的工业和农村经济已经荒废不堪。南朝鲜人民正呻吟在恐怖统治之下。
    美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的这种战争政策，已遭到了南朝鲜人民的坚决反对，这绝不是偶然的。因为南朝鲜人民进一步认识了朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的政策的正确，并更深刻地认识了只有和平统一祖国的道路，才是维护人民的真正自由和权利的唯一的道路。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府，为了实现全朝鲜人民一致渴望着的祖国的和平统一，已经向南朝鲜当局屡次提出了具有诚意的具体方案。但是李承晚匪帮却以“北进统一”的陈词滥调回答了我方的正当建议。
    然而，经验证明，为自己祖国的自由独立而进行着正义的斗争的人民和他们的军队，是任何侵略势力也不可战胜的。
    曾经英勇地捍卫了祖国的自由和独立的朝鲜人民军的全体官兵们，将更加坚决地为保卫祖国和人民及其所争取的胜利果实而进行斗争。
    朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军官兵们，为了祖国的建设和威力的进一步加强，将不断地向苏联和各人民民主国家学习先进经验，将更紧密地团结在伟大的工人阶级国际主义旗帜下，永远大踏步地向前迈进。
