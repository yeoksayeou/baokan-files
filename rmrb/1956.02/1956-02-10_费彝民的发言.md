Mr. Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

　　I fully agree with and warmly support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the important reports of the leaders.

　　Today's motherland has entered a new era unprecedented in history. The magnificent achievements in economic and cultural construction over the past 6 years, 600 million people united as one, rallying around the Party and the government, striving for a common aspiration, that is, striving to build a socialist society and defend lasting peace! No wonder the imperialists find it difficult to understand how an ancient country that has been weak for more than 100 years could emerge in the world with a new look in just 6 years. They are also unwilling to understand that our compatriots are marching forward with one heart and one mind towards a greater ideal, which is what Chairman Mao has declared: We must strive to change our country's backwardness in economy, science, and culture in a few decades and rapidly reach the advanced level of the world. Even compatriots who have lived overseas and in Hong Kong and Macao for the past 6 years and have never returned to visit have doubts because they have not witnessed it firsthand. I am a journalist working in Hong Kong, and I know that some overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have two questions: (1) How could there be so many achievements so quickly in 6 years? (2) Can all the plans for building socialism be realized?

　　For domestic compatriots, after the past 6 years of study and practice, after their actual experience of accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they do not have the above two questions, or they have completely solved the above two questions. The fact is that the Five-Year Plan can not only be realized, but can be completed ahead of schedule in four to four and a half years. The fact is that agricultural cooperation is not difficult. The number of peasant households joining the cooperative has accounted for 78% of the total number of peasant households in the country, and the semi-socialist cooperation can be basically completed this year, and the fully socialist cooperation can be basically completed in another two years. The fact is that private industrial and commercial enterprises in many places have realized the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry. Not only do the industrialists and businessmen themselves require immediate joint ownership, but even their families also agree to joint ownership. These are all ironclad facts that we have heard and witnessed. Overseas and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots ask why it is possible? Why are the results so fast? So many? We should point out to them that all the compatriots in the country are united around the Party and the government, and 600 million people are working hard for socialist transformation and socialist construction. This is a reliable guarantee for achieving results. And this kind of achievement has world significance.

　　Overseas and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots then ask: Can all future plans be realized? We should tell them with certainty that it is absolutely possible. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, we are already confident that we can complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and accelerate the entry into socialist society. At the same time, we deeply believe that any plan of the Party and the government, like all the plans that have been put into practice in the past 6 years, combines theory and practice and has a scientific basis. We have sufficient reasons to believe that whether it is the 12-year agricultural development program, improving the level of science and technology, or other socialist construction plans, they will definitely be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded, just like the first Five-Year Plan.

　　Speaking of scientists, I personally feel that the long-term plan to fully mobilize and give play to the strength of intellectuals is indeed a very timely call that coincides with the arrival of today's socialist upsurge. Intellectuals across the country, including myself, should make a guarantee: strive to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and carry out self-transformation in terms of ideological consciousness; in terms of academic and technical knowledge, strengthen research, strengthen advanced studies, and strive to rapidly reach and exceed the world's advanced level. The saying in the past was "The rise and fall of the country, everyone is responsible." Today's saying should be: The success or failure of socialism, workers, peasants, and intellectuals are responsible!

　　Finally, I would also like to talk about the Taiwan liberation issue. I absolutely support Chairman Zhou Enlai's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Taiwan is our country's sacred territory, and the 8 million compatriots in Taiwan are an inseparable part of the Chinese people. Due to the United States' military occupation and interference in our internal affairs, and due to the Chiang Kai-shek clique's obsession, the Taiwan compatriots have suffered a few more years of pain in vain. The people of the motherland care about the fate of the Kuomintang military and political personnel and point out two paths to them, asking them to repent and return. And the Taiwan compatriots, seeing the motherland becoming increasingly prosperous, must also feel encouraged and look forward to returning to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Liberating Taiwan is an internal affair of our country. All of our people, including the people on the mainland and the people in Taiwan, should unite under the banner of patriotism and work together to solve this affair that belongs to our country. In order to realize the peaceful liberation of Taiwan as soon as possible, and in order to enable the 8 million Taiwan compatriots to engage in socialist construction together with the compatriots of the motherland and share its fruits, I think all the Kuomintang military and political personnel who fled from the mainland to Taiwan, regarding Chairman Zhou Enlai's great and benevolent call, they should be willing to liberate Taiwan through peaceful means, help the motherland eliminate the tension in the Taiwan region, and realize the complete reunification of the great motherland. In this way, not only will they have made contributions to the motherland, but they will also have made contributions to Asian and world peace. According to Chairman Zhou Enlai's words, anyone who is willing to take the road of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, no matter who they are, no matter how great their past crimes were, the Chinese people will treat them leniently and not hold them accountable for the past. Two paths are in front of you, where to go, make a decision early, and strive to perform meritorious service as soon as possible and return to the embrace of the motherland!

    费彝民的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我对于周恩来主席的政治报告和各位首长的各项重要报告，完全赞成，热烈拥护。
    今天的祖国已进入历史上从来不曾有过的新时代。6年来在经济、文化建设方面的辉煌成就，6万万人一条心，团结在党和政府的周围，为一种共同愿望而努力，即是为建设社会主义社会和保卫持久和平而努力！难怪帝国主义者不容易理解，一个积弱100多年的古老国家，怎么可能在短短6年之间，以崭新姿态出现于世界。他们也不愿意理解我国同胞正在齐心一致地朝着更大的理想迈进，这就是毛主席所昭示的，我们要在几十年内，努力改变我国在经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，迅速达到世界上的先进水平。就是长期住在海外和港澳而6年来又从未回来观光的同胞们，因为没有亲眼目睹，也有人疑信参半。我是在香港工作的新闻工作者，知道海外侨胞和港澳同胞们中，有的人存在着两种疑问：（一）6年来怎么可能这样快就有这么多的成就？（二）建设社会主义的一切规划究竟能不能实现？
    对国内同胞来说，经过过去6年的学习和实践，经过他们接受中国共产党和毛主席领导的实际经历，他们不发生上面两个问题，或者已经完全解决了上面两个问题。事实是，五年计划不但能够实现，而且是四年到四年半就可以提前完成。事实是，农业合作化并不难，入社农户已占全国农户78％，今年内可以基本上完成半社会主义合作化，再经过两年就可以基本上完成全社会主义合作化。事实是，私营工商业在许多地方已实现全行业公私合营，不但工商业家本身要求马上合营，连他们的家属也赞成合营。这都是我们所耳闻目睹的铁一样的事实。海外和港澳同胞要问为什么可能？为什么成绩这样快？这样多？我们应该向他们指出：全国同胞团结在党和政府周围，6万万人都在为社会主义改造和社会主义建设而努力，这就是获得成绩的可靠的保证。而这种成绩是具有世界意义的。
    海外和港澳同胞再问：今后的一切规划是不是都可以实现呢？我们应该肯定地告诉他们说绝对可能。在党和政府的领导下，我们已经有把握提早完成第一个五年计划和加速进入社会主义社会，同时我们又深深相信党和政府的任何规划，都和过去6年中的一切已经实践的计划一样，是理论与实践相结合的，是有科学根据的。我们有充分理由可以相信：无论是12年农业发展纲要，提高科学技术水平，以及其他各方面的社会主义建设规划，都必定和第一个五年计划一样，不仅提前而且可以超额完成。
    谈到科学家，我个人觉得充分动员和发挥知识分子力量的长期规划，的确是配合今天社会主义高潮来临的一个非常及时的号召。全国知识分子，包括我自己在内，应该提出保证：努力做到在思想意识方面，加紧学习马克思列宁主义，进行自我改造；在学问技术方面，加紧研究，加紧进修，争取迅速达到并超过世界先进水平。从前的话是“国家兴亡，匹夫有责”，今天的话应该是社会主义成败，工人、农民、知识分子有责！
    最后，我还要谈一谈台湾解放问题。我绝对拥护周恩来主席所提出的和平解放台湾的号召。台湾是我国神圣的领土，台湾800万同胞是中国人民不可分离的一部分。由于美国的武力侵占，干涉我内政，由于蒋介石集团的执迷不悟，白白地使台湾同胞多受了几年痛苦。祖国人民关怀国民党军政人员的命运，向他们指出两条道路，要他们悔罪来归。而台湾同胞眼看着祖国日益兴旺，也一定感到振奋，期待着早日回到祖国怀抱。解放台湾是我们国家的内部事务，我们全体人民，包括大陆人民和台湾人民，应该在爱国主义旗帜下团结起来，共同努力来解决这个属于我国内部的事务。为了提早实现台湾的和平解放，为了提早使台湾800万同胞和祖国同胞一起，共同从事社会主义建设并分享其成果，我想所有从大陆上跑到台湾的国民党军政人员，对于周恩来主席这一伟大而仁厚的号召，他们应该愿意通过和平途径解放台湾，帮助祖国消除台湾地区的紧张局势，实现伟大祖国的完全统一。这样，不仅对祖国立了功勋，而且对亚洲和世界和平也作了贡献。根据周恩来主席的话，凡是愿意走和平解放台湾道路的，不管任何人，也不管他们过去犯过多大罪过，中国人民都将宽大对待，不究既往。两条道路摆在你们面前，何去何从，要早下决心，应该及早争取立功，回到祖国的怀抱里来！
