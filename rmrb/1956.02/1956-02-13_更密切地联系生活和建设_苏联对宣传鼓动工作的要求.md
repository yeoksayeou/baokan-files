    To Connect More Closely with Life and Construction
    The Soviet Union's Requirements for Propaganda and Agitation Work
    By Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Lǐ Hé
    The Soviet Communist Party organizations are carrying out tremendous agitation work among the masses. The network of agitators penetrates enterprises and residential areas. It guarantees the connection between the Party and the people, mobilizing the masses to realize the Party's policies. There are many such examples.
    Natalia Nesterenko is an agitator from the "Ray of Light" collective farm in the Red District of Moscow Oblast. She requested the organization to assign her to work in the livestock farm. One afternoon, she saw a young milkmaid hurriedly milk the cows and rush home. Nesterenko suspected that the milk was not completely milked. She asked the team leader to check the cows milked by this young woman. A cup of milk was squeezed from the first cow, half a cup from the second, half a cup from the third, and another cup from the fourth… The team leader and the agitator checked the cows cared for by other milkmaids and found the same situation. After consulting with the director of the livestock farm and the livestock technician, Nesterenko organized a "Discussion on a Cup of Milk" among the milkmaids.
    She began the conversation like this: "Is a cup of milk a lot? Some of you might say: What's so strange about a cup of milk? We milk more than 2,500 kilograms every day."
    A milkmaid interjected: "Of course, a cup of milk is a small matter. Is it even worth talking about? My cow, Zorka, produces about 100 cups of milk a day."
    Nesterenko said: "I still want to talk about a cup of milk." She described what she had seen. Then she explained: "Let's do the math. If each of you squeezed just half a cup more milk from each cow (some of you are squeezing less than a cup), we would get nearly 70 kilograms more milk every day. That's more than 2,500 tons a year. If converted into money, the collective farm would lose more than 40,000 rubles annually due to our carelessness. This is just our collective farm. If we consider the farms in the entire district, the entire province, if everyone treats things with a master's sense of care, our country could get millions of kilograms more milk. Our potential lies right here." In addition, she explained that not milking the cows completely would reduce the milk yield in the future.
    In this way, the agitator started with small things, successfully explaining to the masses the Party's great tasks related to increasing agricultural products.
    The next day, the amount of milk produced increased.
    Agitators and reporters like Nesterenko, who are good at connecting political work with life, are precisely what the Soviet Union demands today. The achievements of political agitation work in the Soviet Union are significant. However, as the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's newspapers and periodicals point out, there are also serious shortcomings in agitation work: political agitation work is divorced from life, divorced from the reality of communist construction, not good at summarizing and quickly promoting examples of communist construction that have been tested by life, and not good at arousing people to fight against bad phenomena that hinder progress.
    At the Soviet Communist Party's congresses at all levels, the shortcomings of ideological work being divorced from reality were severely criticized. The party congress criticized the phenomenon in some areas of only asking about the number of agitators and the number of discussion meetings, regardless of the content of the talks and whether they were connected to actual life and specific tasks. The phenomenon that many district, city, state, and republic workers themselves did not carry out political work among the masses, completely pushing the masses' political work onto the agitators, a phenomenon of being divorced from the masses and violating the party's traditions, was also criticized.
    At the party congress of the Tushkin District in Kaliningrad Oblast, collective farm chairman Rybin criticized: A representative of the district committee came to the collective farm and began to advise people that milk, meat, and eggs are good things, so production should be increased. When the farmers asked him how to do it better and faster, what advanced experiences there were, he couldn't answer. The reporter could only make "general and comprehensive" talks.
    Some agitation workers talk about communism as if they are talking about some distant goal. But for the Soviet people—the builders of a communist society—what is needed is not general platitudes, but explanations of the specific tasks of communist construction and the ways and methods of solving these tasks.
    Some agitation workers report only good news and not bad news, habitually talking about achievements and avoiding sensitive issues. They forget that the Soviet Communist Party has never concealed difficulties and shortcomings, and they ignore that in the beautiful life of the Soviet Union there are still backward ideas and behaviors that need to be struggled against and overcome.
    
    In the past two years, the Soviet Union has done a lot of work in overcoming dogmatism in propaganda. The quality of the party's political and theoretical education has improved. The leading role of the Communist Party has been propagated more fully and deeply. More attention has been paid to the study of the decisions and domestic and foreign policies of the Party and the government. The principle of party members voluntarily choosing political study methods has been adopted, thereby reducing the number of classes and strengthening the quality of propaganda cadres, increasing the proportion of self-study, and increasing the interest in learning.
    However, there are still shortcomings in propaganda work that are similar in nature to those in agitation work. The Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's newspapers and periodicals pointed out that the basic shortcomings of propaganda are: the connection with life is still weak, and it often has an academic, abstract, and bookish flavor. The following phenomena have been criticized.
      (1) Some propaganda workers, when explaining the Party's policies, neglected that their task is not only to disseminate them, but also to strive to achieve them. Therefore, their propaganda was not connected to reality and weakened its combat effectiveness. In an enterprise in Medysh City, a group of people, after studying the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's July Plenum decision on striving for technological progress, the propagandist Dmitriev asked: What should the Party organization do for the decision of the Plenum? One person said: To hold a discussion meeting. Another person said, to correctly select cadres. The propagandist agreed with these opinions and concluded: The main thing is to improve the level of political and organizational work among the masses. As for what party members should do in their own factory, no one mentioned it.
      (2) Some propaganda workers do not combine the current policies of the Party and the government with theory when propagating them among the masses. They think that current policies are not theory, and therefore it is not necessary to explain policies from a theoretical perspective. They do not know that the policies of the Party and the government are the application and development of revolutionary theory in practice. For example, the decision of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's July Plenum is a document with great historical significance and theoretical value. However, some propaganda workers only explain the practical measures to strive for technological progress, and do not explain the theoretical significance of the document and its role in the future development of the Soviet state.
      (3) Some propaganda workers regard the study of theory and policy as studying for the sake of studying, evade the urgent issues raised in reality, and even denounce those who want to connect propaganda with practice as being narrow and simplistic. Not long ago, the plenary meeting of the Moscow Municipal Committee criticized some people for forgetting that the purpose of studying revolutionary theory is to improve practical work and to realize the Party's line. At a theoretical discussion on studying the documents of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's July Plenum in Crimea Oblast, people talked about the shortcomings of the work at the railway station. Someone asked who would try to overcome these shortcomings. The answer was: This is a discussion meeting, not a party member meeting or a meeting of economic workers. People come here to study theory, not to solve production problems. The Crimea Oblast "Truth" newspaper agreed with this answer. The magazine "Party Life" pointed out that this answer and the state newspaper's endorsement were a disconnect between propaganda and life.
      (4) In many party education systems, more attention is paid to the past in the study of party history, and less attention is paid to the wartime and post-war periods. Many party members painstakingly study the materials on the struggle against the Populists and the "Economists" for a long time, but never study the history of the party in the period of communist construction. In this way, people's attention is drawn to the stories of fighting enemies who have become ancient people, rather than on the struggle against the existing remnants of bourgeois ideology and against today's ideological enemies.
      (5) In many party organizations, insufficient attention is paid to the work of ideological struggle. Peaceful coexistence of two systems does not at all mean weakening ideological work. On the contrary, the Soviet Communist Party has always taught the Soviet people to resolutely eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology, popularize a scientific and materialistic worldview, and strive for the complete victory of communist ideology. Some propaganda workers have not well implemented this Marxist-Leninist principle.
    The Soviet Communist Party has criticized various phenomena of ideological work being divorced from life, and requires propaganda and agitation to be more closely connected with life and with communist construction. The Soviet Communist Party requires party organizations at all levels to: (1) strengthen daily leadership of ideological work and pay attention to the content and quality of propaganda and agitation; (2) systematically check party members' political studies and overcome any laissez-faire and lax phenomena; (3) better select propaganda and agitation workers and help them improve their ideological and theoretical level and work ability; (4) constantly study the needs of the masses, the masses' understanding of current events, distinguish between different objects, adopt various methods, and conduct timely and interesting ideological work. The "Truth" newspaper editorial said: "It is necessary to resolutely fight against the indifferent attitude towards Marxist-Leninist propaganda and the inadequacy of ideological work."
    The Soviet Communist Party has accumulated rich experience in ideological work, and many ideological workers possess a high level of Marxist-Leninist theory, so propaganda and agitation will undoubtedly be more closely linked to life and construction. New forms of learning that closely integrate theory and practice have emerged in the party education system.
    Current affairs groups are now very popular in the Soviet Union. Participants study important decisions of the Party and the government, analyze major international events, and deeply think about these decisions and events based on their theoretical knowledge, connecting theoretical research with life and current practical tasks. Many of these group studies not only help people understand current politics, but also help people receive communist education, help improve party work, and help complete production plans. Many current affairs groups studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the issue of agricultural cooperativization in China. According to the requirements of party members, some current affairs groups led by party organizations, when studying the decisions of the Party and the government on industrial and agricultural work, also refer to some Marxist-Leninist classics. Experience has proven that current affairs groups that work with a plan and study issues that can be closely integrated with specific tasks have achieved very good results.
    The practice of communist construction and the Soviet Communist Party's program for developing industry and agriculture have increased people's interest in studying economic theory. In Moscow, more than 83,000 party members are studying political economy and the specific economics of industry, construction, and agriculture, forming 392 economic lectures. In Rostov, 5,400 party members participate in 257 workshops studying economic theory.
    A type of economic school and workshop that closely integrates theory and practice has emerged in Rostov in response to people's needs. The students are party members who do not leave production. These night-time economic schools run by the municipal committee and workshops studying specific economics in some enterprises have achieved very good results. They use theory to study specific economic phenomena in industry and agriculture, analyze the economic indicators of their own enterprises, and draw conclusions that can be used by the leaders of factories and workshops. In economic schools and workshops, each student takes turns making detailed theoretical reports, which are then discussed by everyone. The report is specific and is the result of the reporter summarizing the situation of the department in which they work.
    The Soviet Communist Party follows Lenin's maxim left at the beginning of the Soviet regime: "... First of all, it is necessary to connect the masses with the construction of general life. This should be the main and basic thing in the work of every agitator and propagandist. When he masters this, his work will be guaranteed success."

### 更密切地联系生活和建设  苏联对宣传鼓动工作的要求

    更密切地联系生活和建设
    苏联对宣传鼓动工作的要求
    本报驻苏联记者  李何	一
    苏共组织在群众中进行着巨大的鼓动工作。鼓动员网深入到企业和居民中。它保证党和人民的联系，动员群众实现党的政策。这样的例子是很多的。
    纳塔里雅·涅斯捷连卡是莫斯科州红山区“光芒”集体农庄的鼓动员。她请求组织派她在养畜场工作。一天下午，她看见一位年轻的挤奶妇匆忙地挤了牛奶便跑回家去了。涅斯捷连卡怀疑牛奶是否挤尽了。她请组长检查一下这位年轻人挤过的一群乳牛。从第一头身上挤下了一杯牛奶，第二头半杯，第三头半杯，第四头又一杯……。组长和鼓动员检查了其他挤奶妇照管的乳牛，发现了同样的情况。涅斯捷连卡同养畜场主任和养畜技师商量之后，在挤奶妇中间组织了一次“关于一杯牛奶”的座谈会。
    她这样开始了谈话：“一杯牛奶，这算多吗？你们当中大概会有人说：想想看，一杯牛奶有什么奇怪？我们每天挤2，500公斤以上哩。”
    一位挤奶妇插进来说：“当然，一杯牛奶是小事情。这还值得谈吗？我的乳牛佐尔卡一天都出乳100来杯。”
    涅斯捷连卡说：“我还是要谈一下一杯牛奶的事。”她叙述了自己看见的。接着解释：“来算个账吧。要是你们每个人从每头乳牛身上那怕只多挤半杯牛奶（有些人多挤不到一杯），我们每天将多得近70公斤牛奶。一年将多得2，500多吨。要是折成货币，那么集体农庄由于我们的粗心大意每年将损失4万多卢布。这只是我们一个集体农庄。如果拿全区、全省的农庄来算，要是到处以主人翁的爱惜态度对待事情，我们国家可以多得几百万公斤牛奶。就在这里也找到我们的潜力。”此外，她解释了：不挤尽牛奶会引起乳牛下次出奶量的降低。
    这样，鼓动员从小事情开始，向群众成功地解释了和扩增农产品相联系的党的巨大任务。
    第二天，挤出的牛奶量就增加了。
    像涅斯捷连卡这样善于把政治工作和生活联系起来的鼓动员、报告员，正是苏联今天所要求的。苏联的政治鼓动工作的成绩是显著的。但是，如像苏共中央的报纸和刊物所指出的，在鼓动工作中也存在着严重的缺点：政治鼓动工作脱离生活，脱离共产主义建设的实际，不善于总结和迅速地推广那些经过生活考验的共产主义建设的榜样，不善于唤起人们向那些阻碍进步的坏现象作斗争。
    在苏共各级代表会议上，严厉地批评了思想工作脱离生活实际的缺点。党代表会议批评了某些地区只问鼓动员的人数和座谈会的次数而不管谈话的内容和是否联系实际生活和具体任务。许多区、市、州、共和国的工作人员自己不向群众进行政治工作，把群众政治工作完全推在鼓动员身上的现象，这种脱离群众和违背党的传统的现象，也受到了批评。
    在加里宁格勒州图什金区党代表会议上，集体农庄主席雷宾批评说：一位区委的代表来到集体农庄，开始劝人家说，牛乳、肉、鸡蛋是好东西，所以要提高生产。等到庄员们请教他怎样更好更快地做到，有什么先进经验，他却答不出来。报告人只能作“一般的和全面的”谈话。
    有些鼓动工作人员谈论共产主义的时候好像谈论什么老远的目标。但是对于苏联人——共产主义社会的建设者来说，不需要一般的泛论，而需要共产主义建设具体任务和解决这些任务的道路和方法的解释。
    有些鼓动工作人员报喜不报忧，习惯于谈论成绩，而回避尖锐问题。他们忘记了苏联共产党从来没有掩盖困难和缺点，他们忽视了在苏联的美丽生活中还有落后的思想和行为需要斗争和克服。	二
    最近两年来，苏联在克服宣传中的教条主义上做了不少工作。党的政治理论教育的质量提高了。更加充分更加深刻地宣传了共产党的领导作用。更加注意了党和政府的决定和内外政策的研究。采取了党员自愿地选择政治学习方式的原则，从而减少班组的数量而加强了宣传干部的质量，增加了自修的比重和提高了学习的兴趣。
    但是在宣传工作中还存在着同鼓动工作同样性质的缺点。苏共中央的报纸和刊物指出宣传的基本缺点是：同生活的联系还弱，时常带有学院式的、抽象的、书本的气味。如下的现象都受到了批评。
      （一）有些宣传工作人员在解释党的政策的时候，忽视了他们的任务不仅在于传播它们，还要争取实现。所以他们的宣传没有联系实际，削弱了战斗性。在梅地什市的一个企业中有一组人在研究苏共中央七月全会关于争取技术进步的决定以后，宣传员季米特里耶夫问：党的组织应当为全会的决定做什么呢？一个人说：要举行座谈会。另一个人说，要正确地挑选干部。宣传员同意这些意见，做出结论说：主要的要提高在群众中的政治工作和组织工作的水平。至于党员在自己工厂中应做什么，谁也没有提起。
      （二）有些宣传工作人员不把当前党和政府的政策与理论结合起来在群众中宣传。他们以为当前的政策不是理论，因而不必从理论的角度来阐明政策。他们不知道党和政府的政策是革命理论在实际中的运用和发展。例如苏共中央七月全会的决定是有巨大历史意义和理论价值的文件。但有些宣传工作人员只说明争取技术进步的实际措施，不讲解文件的理论意义和它对于苏联国家发展前途的作用。
      （三）有些宣传工作人员把研究理论和政策看做为研究而研究，回避现实中提出的迫切问题，甚至斥责那些想把宣传和实际联系起来的人是狭隘和简单化。不久以前莫斯科市委全体会议批评了有些人忘记了学习革命理论是为了改进实际工作，为了实现党的路线。在克里木州一次学习苏共中央七月全会文件的理论讨论会上，人们谈到火车站工作的缺点。有人问谁将设法克服这些缺点。得到的回答是：这是讨论会，不是党员大会也不是经济工作人员会议，人们来这里学习理论而不是解决生产问题。克里木州“真理报”赞同这种回答。“党的生活”杂志指出这种回答和州报的赞同是宣传和生活脱节。
      （四）在许多党的教育系统中，关于党史的研究，注意过去较多，注意战时和战后时期较少。许多党员长久地精读关于反对民粹派和“经济主义者”斗争时期的材料，总是研究不到党在共产主义建设时期的历史。这样，人们的注意力被吸引在同已成古人的敌人斗争故事上面，而不在反对现存的资产阶级思想残余，反对今天思想敌人的斗争上面。
      （五）在许多党的组织中对思想斗争的工作注意不够。两个制度的和平共处完全不是说要削弱思想工作。相反的，苏共向来教导苏联人民坚决不移地消灭资产阶级思想意识残余，普及科学的唯物主义世界观，争取共产主义思想的完全胜利。有些宣传工作人员没有很好地执行这个马克思列宁主义的原则。	三
    苏联共产党批评了在思想工作中各种脱离生活现象，要求宣传和鼓动更加密切地联系生活、联系共产主义建设。苏共要求各级党的组织：（一）加强对思想工作的日常领导，注意宣传鼓动的内容和质量；（二）有系统地检查党员的政治学习，克服任何自流和松懈现象；（三）更好地挑选宣传鼓动工作人员，帮助他们提高思想理论水平和工作能力；（四）经常地研究群众的需要，群众对当前事件的了解的情形，区别不同的对象，采取各种方式，进行及时的有兴趣的思想工作。“真理报”社论说：“必须对马克思列宁主义宣传的漠不关心的态度和对思想工作的不足，进行坚决的斗争。”
    苏联共产党累积有丰富的思想工作经验，许多思想工作人员具备着高度的马克思列宁主义理论水平，所以宣传鼓动无疑地将会更加密切地同生活和建设联系起来。在党的教育系统中已经出现了理论和实际紧密结合的新的学习形式。
    时事小组现在苏联很流行。参加的人学习党和政府的重要决定，分析重大的国际事件，并且根据自己的理论知识深刻地思考这些决定和事件，把理论研究同生活、同当前实际任务联系起来。许多这种小组的学习不单帮助人们了解当前政治，而且帮助人们受到共产主义教育，帮助党的工作的改进和生产计划的完成。许多时事小组研究了中共中央七届六中全会（扩大）的文件和中国农业合作化问题。根据党员的要求，某些党组织领导的时事小组在研究党和政府关于工农业工作的决定的时候，并参考一些马克思列宁主义经典著作。经验证明：凡是工作有计划，研究的问题能和具体任务密切结合的时事小组，成绩都很好。
    共产主义建设的实践，苏共关于发展工农业的纲领，提高了人们研究经济理论的兴趣。在莫斯科市，有83，000多党员研究着政治经济学和工业、建筑业、农业的具体经济学，组成392个经济讲座。在罗斯托夫市，有5，400党员参加257个讲习班研究经济理论。
    一种理论和实践紧密结合的经济学校和讲习班，在罗斯托夫市应着人们的需要出现了。学员是不脱离生产的党员。这些由市委办的夜间经济学校和在某些企业中研究具体经济的讲习班，成绩很好。他们用理论来研究工业和农业中的具体经济现象，分析自己企业的经济指标，得出可供工厂、车间的领导使用的结论。在经济学校和讲习班中，每个学员要轮流作详细的理论的报告，然后由大家讨论它。报告是具体的，是报告人归纳自己工作的那个部门的情形的结果。
    苏联共产党遵循着列宁在苏维埃政权初期留下的格言：“……首先，必须使群众和总的生活的建设联系起来。这在每个鼓动员、宣传员的工作中应当是主要和基本的，当他掌握这个的时候，他的工作将确保成功。”
