Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's "Political Report," Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's "The Mission of Intellectuals in the High Tide of Socialist Revolution," and the reports of other leaders, as well as reading Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals at the Central Committee meeting, I have further realized the Party and Chairman Mao's meticulous care and love for intellectuals, which makes me very excited and moved. It also makes me feel the weight of responsibility and the need to further transform myself. I fully support these reports and am determined to work hard to implement them.

I am a literary and art worker, engaged in literary and artistic teaching, and have also been responsible for trade union work for several years. Here, I would like to report on some situations and offer some immature suggestions:

	I. Appropriately Adjust Personnel in Universities and Colleges to Overcome Uneven Distribution of Labor and Leisure, and to Universally Leverage the Strengths of Senior Intellectuals.

After the adjustments of departments and faculties, personnel in universities and colleges have greatly improved compared to the past. However, the phenomenon of uneven distribution of labor and leisure is quite common in some universities and colleges, and in some schools, this phenomenon is even quite serious. For example, some department heads also serve as heads of teaching and research groups and teach two to three courses, with a workload that is more than double what is stipulated by the Ministry of Education. Some department heads do not teach courses, or only teach a section of courses lasting about one to two months per year. Some department heads, teaching and research group leaders, or professors hold three, four, or even seven or eight social activity positions. In addition to teaching, they attend two or three meetings every day and can only prepare lessons late at night. Their selfless enthusiasm and initiative are commendable, but damaging their health does not conform to the long-term interests of the country. In the same school, some teachers have no concurrent positions and only teach two or three hours of courses per week, or even do not teach at all, and are bored. The disparity in the number of teachers between colleges and universities is also very alarming. Taking a Chinese Language Department as an example, some colleges have about 130 students in the department, but nearly 50 teachers; some colleges have 300 students in the department, but only sixteen or seventeen teachers. In some schools, one teacher guides only two students during internships; in other schools, one teacher guides 15 students. Generally, universities and colleges in large cities have more teachers, while those in remote provinces have fewer teachers. This is unreasonable and should be adjusted in a timely manner to rationally allocate human resources so that the potential of intellectuals can be more fully and universally leveraged in work, teaching, training new teachers, and scientific research.

	II. Take Care of Teachers in Universities and Colleges in Remote Areas and Organize Them to Visit and Study in Large Cities or Advanced Areas in a Planned Way to Increase Their Knowledge and Improve Their Political Awareness and Professional Level.

Teachers in universities and colleges in remote areas generally work hard, and some are even proud to engage in pioneering work in remote areas. They are as eager as starving people for absorbing new knowledge. For example, they see news about the Soviet Exhibition, foreign art troupes, dance troupes, sports delegations, scientific report meetings, and academic discussion meetings in the newspapers, and they all hope to have the opportunity to watch or participate.

The library, equipment, and instruments in universities and colleges in remote areas are also relatively poor, and the treatment of some teachers is also set lower than in large cities.

Due to the above reasons, they deeply feel that they have fewer opportunities to learn and progress more slowly. Some of them develop feelings of inferiority, and some even have the idea of not being content with their positions. Of course, feelings of inferiority and unwillingness to work are unhealthy thoughts and feelings that need to be continuously given kind assistance and education. The leadership also needs to grasp their characteristics and provide appropriate care in terms of work, study, library equipment, etc. as much as possible. For example, organize them to visit the Soviet Exhibition as much as possible; scientific report meetings by Soviet experts or famous scholars can be organized in the central cities of each province or former large administrative region, and senior intellectuals from nearby provinces can be organized to participate; foreign art troupes, etc., should also try to perform in more provinces within a possible scope; during the summer vacation, organize tour groups to visit and study in advanced areas; in terms of living conditions, strive to act according to the principle of equal pay for equal work and pay according to work, and do not suppress them. In short, find ways to make them feel warm and that working in remote areas is more glorious. In this way, they can be encouraged and improved, which will have unexpected effects on more fully leveraging their strengths.

	III. It is hoped that literary and art workers, especially writers, with relatively good literary accomplishment, will go to remote provinces to experience life, reflect the reality of socialist transformation and socialist construction in these areas, and guide the literary and art work in these areas.

Taking Guangxi as an example, there are very few writers. The provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has discovered young writers with potential for development, but it is not easy to find suitable writers to mentor them. Guiju opera troupes and Peking opera troupes cannot find anyone to adapt traditional scripts; it is even more difficult to find someone to create scripts that reflect real life. When they go to the countryside to perform, the masses love to watch the plays, but they are very busy with production, so the district and township cadres said to the troupes: "If you perform plays reflecting cooperativization, we will mobilize all the people in the district and township to watch them, which is easier to solve ideological problems than holding several nights of meetings. But if you perform classical plays, it will be difficult for us to arrange the time." The troupes deeply feel the distress that the repertoire cannot meet the needs of the masses. The troupes are very willing to stage modern plays, but there are no scripts. To create scripts, the support of literary and art workers with higher accomplishment is needed.

	IV. The trade union dues of the education system must implement Premier Zhou's instructions and be used for the members' welfare and recreational and sports activities in basic units to improve their material and cultural life.

In the past, all the trade union dues of the education trade union were turned over to the provincial and municipal trade union federations, and all expenses had to be budgeted in the previous month. Individual provincial and municipal trade union federations often failed to grasp the characteristics of education workers, especially senior intellectuals in universities and colleges. The management of funds was too rigid, and therefore, the use of funds often failed to meet the needs. There are some examples: a grassroots trade union bought a tube of stencil paper, budgeted for 5 yuan, actually spent 7 yuan, exceeded by 2 yuan, and was not allowed to be reimbursed; a school trade union nominated a worker for excellence, and the grassroots trade union asked the higher-level trade union to allocate 10 yuan to buy a prize, but it was not approved; all teachers and staff of a school signed a request to the higher-level trade union to allocate funds to buy a ping-pong table, but it was not approved. A grassroots trade union requested to issue a copy of the "Draft Model Charter of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" as learning material, which was not allowed; a request for subsidies for travel expenses to visit collective farms was also not allowed. Therefore, some members said: "We only have the obligation to pay union dues." This will affect the enhancement of their organizational awareness and the promotion of their enthusiasm as masters of their own affairs. I believe that the use of education trade union funds must be earnestly, practically, and strictly implemented in accordance with Premier Zhou's instructions, and should be used as much as possible to improve the members' material and cultural life.

The above four points are suggestions to the leadership.

Of course, as Vice Chairman Guo Moruo pointed out: "If problems are to be completely solved, the responsibility of at least half of them must rely on the efforts of the intellectuals themselves." While affirming the progress of our intellectual circles in the past six years, we must also face up to our shortcomings. We should consciously respond to Vice Chairman Guo's call, examine ourselves daily with three questions, demand ourselves according to the standards of Communist Party members, and continuously improve our political awareness and professional level through the observation and practice of social life, the practice of our professions, and the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. We should strictly spur ourselves with the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, overcome all non-working-class thoughts, and truly become "intellectuals who serve socialism wholeheartedly," as Premier Zhou said. Only in this way can we meet the requirements of the motherland and live up to the ardent expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    林焕平的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听了周恩来总理的“政治报告”，郭沫若副主席的“在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命”的报告，和其他几位首长的报告，也看了周总理在党中央会议上所作关于知识分子问题的报告，进一步体会到党和毛主席对知识分子的关怀和爱护，无微不至，使我非常的兴奋，非常的感动，也使我感到责任的重大和进一步改造自己的必要。我完全拥护这些报告，并决心为贯彻它们而努力。
    我是一个文艺工作者，从事文艺教学工作，并且几年来也负责工会工作。在这里，我想汇报一些情况，也算是不成熟的建议：
    一、适当调整高等学校人事，克服劳逸不均，以普遍发挥高级知识分子的力量。
    院系调整以后，高等学校人事，比较从前已大有改进。但目前在某些高等学校中，劳逸不均的现象相当普遍，有的学校，这种现象甚且相当严重。例如有的系主任还兼教研组长，并教两门到三门功课，工作量达到教育部所规定的一倍之多；有的系主任则不教课，或一学年只教一段约一两个月的课。有些系主任、教研组长或教授，兼三四种乃至七八种社会活动职务，除上课外，每天开两三个会，备课只有开夜车。他们忘我劳动的热情与积极，值得表扬，但损坏了健康，却并不符合国家的长远利益。而同在一个学校里，有些教师则既无兼职，每周亦仅教二三小时的课，甚至不开课，闲得无聊。在院校与院校之间，教师人数悬殊，也是很惊人的。同以一个中国语文系为例，有的院校，该系学生130人左右，而教师将达50人；有的院校，该系学生达300人，而教师只十六七人。有的学校实习，一位教师只指导两位学生；有的学校则一位教师指导15位学生。一般情况是：大城市的高等学校，教师比较多；边远省份的高等学校，教师比较少。这是不合理的，应该及时调整，合理地分配人力，才能在工作、教学、培养新师资和科学研究上，更充分地更普遍地发挥知识分子的潜力。
    二、照顾边远地区高等学校的教师，有计划地组织他们到大城市或先进地区参观学习，以增广知识，提高他们的政治觉悟和业务水平。
    边远地区高等学校的教师，一般都努力工作，有的且能以在边远地区从事开恳工作而感到光荣。他们对吸收新知识的要求如饥似渴。例如苏联展览会，外国艺术代表团、歌舞代表团、体育代表团等的表演，科学报告会，学术讨论会等，他们从报上看到这些消息，都希望得到机会去观看或参加。
    边远地区高等学校的图书仪器设备也比较差，有些教师的待遇，也定得比大城市为低。
    由于上述原因，他们深深感到自己学习机会比较少，进步比较慢，他们有些人就产生自卑感，甚至还有些人有不安于位的思想。固然，自卑感也好，不安心工作也好，都是不健康的思想和感情，需要不断地予以亲切的帮助和教育。领导上也有必要掌握他们的特点，在工作、学习、图书仪器设备等方面，尽可能予以适当地照顾。例如苏联展览会，尽量组织他们去参观；苏联专家或著名学者的科学报告会等，可以组织到各省或原大行政区的中心城市去举行，组织附近各省的高级知识分子去参加；外国艺术团等，在可能范围内，也尽量多到各省去表演；暑假期间，组织参观团到先进地区去参观学习；生活待遇方面，务求根据同工同酬，按劳取酬的原则办事，不可压低。总之，是想方设法使他们感到温暖，感到在边远地区工作更光荣。这样，既可以鼓舞他们，又可以提高他们，对于更充分地发挥他们的力量，会有意想不到的效力。
    三、希望文艺修养比较好的文艺工作者，特别是作家，到边远省份去体验生活，反映这些地区的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的现实，并指导这些地区的文艺工作。
    以广西来说，作家极少，省文联发见了有培养前途的青年写作者，却不易找到适当的作家来带徒弟。桂剧团、京剧团要改编传统剧本，找不到人；要创作反映现实生活的剧本，更找不到人。他们下乡演戏，群众非常地爱看戏，但他们生产很忙，所以区乡干部对剧团说：“你们演反映合作化的戏，我们动员全区全乡的老百姓来看，这比我们开几晚的会还容易解决思想问题。但是你们演古典戏，我们就难于安排时间了。”剧团深刻地感到剧目不能满足群众要求的苦恼。剧团是非常愿意排现代戏的，但苦无剧本。要创作剧本，就需要较有修养的文艺工作者支援。
    四、教育系统的工会的会费，必须贯彻周总理的指示，使用于基本单位的会员的生活福利和文娱体育活动等方面，以提高他们的物质文化生活。
    过去教育工会的会费，全部上缴省市工会联合会，分文开销都要在上一个月做预算。个别省市工会联合会往往未能掌握教育工作者，特别是高等学校的高级知识分子的特点，经费抓得很死，因而经费使用得往往不合需要。有这样的一些例子：某基层工会买一筒蜡纸，预算5元，实支7元，超出二元，不准报销；某校工友评优，基层工会向上级工会请拨10元买奖品，不批准；某校全体教工签名请上级工会拨款买一张乒乓球台，不批准。某基层工会要求发一本“农业生产合作社示范章程草案”作学习资料，不行；要求补助旅费去参观集体农庄，也不行。因此，有些会员说：“我们只有缴会费的义务罢了”。这对于提高他们的组织观念，发挥他们当家作主的工作积极性，是会受到影响的。我认为对教育工会的经费使用，必须认真切实严格地贯彻周总理的指示，尽量用于提高会员的物质文化生活方面。
    以上这四点，是向领导上建议的。
    当然，正如郭沫若副主席所指示：“问题要想得到彻底的解决，责任的至少一半，还要依靠知识分子自己的努力。”我们肯定了我们知识界6年来的进步，同时必须正视我们的缺点。我们应自觉地响应郭副主席的号召，每日以三问来反省自己，以共产党员的标准来要求自己，透过社会生活的观察和实践、业务的实践和马克思列宁主义理论的学习，以继续不断地提高自己的政治觉悟和业务水平，以批评与自我批评的武器严格地鞭策自己，克服一切非工人阶级思想，使自己真正成为周总理所说的“全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子”。也只有如此，才能够符合祖国对我们的要求，才不辜负党和毛主席对我们的殷切期待。
