Shanxi Province's newly established 7,700-plus advanced agricultural production cooperatives have generally set their production increase plans for this year. In the Changzhi, Yuci, and Xinzhou regions, more than 95% of the members of the advanced cooperatives will have incomes exceeding those of last year. The per-mu yield of these cooperatives will increase by 20% to 50% compared to last year. In Ping Shun, Yuci and other counties, 5 cooperatives, after abolishing field boundaries, connecting land, and reclaiming small plots of wasteland, can expand cultivated land by 1,285 mu. Many advanced cooperatives in the cotton and wheat producing areas of southern Shanxi have proposed expanding cotton fields by more than 50% and can increase the area of double-cropping by one to two times compared to last year's elementary cooperatives. The Xianfeng Advanced Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xiufeng Township, Wutai County, by formulating labor quotas and reward methods for exceeding the quotas, mobilized members to make individual labor plans, thus increasing the utilization rate of labor in the entire cooperative by 32%.

Xinhua News Agency Report: The three production cooperatives led by national famous agricultural labor models Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, Shen Jilan, and Wu Houli, after launching production increase competitions between teams and groups within the cooperatives, have made various spring ploughing preparations quickly and well. In the half-month since these cooperatives proposed launching an agricultural production increase competition nationwide, more than 90% of the members have participated in field labor, braving the severe cold and treading on ice and snow, with an attendance rate more than double that of the same period last year. The "Jin Xing" Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Township and the "Hong Xing" Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Yangjingdi Township have already completed more than 60% of their annual fertilizer accumulation plans, and the "May 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chuandi Township has completed 70% of its fertilizer accumulation plan; moreover, one-third of the fertilizer has already been transported to the fields. To prevent spring drought, these cooperatives have carried out well-digging and snow accumulation to preserve soil moisture. The superior varieties such as Golden Queen needed for spring sowing have all been inspected and sunned, and some old and broken farm tools have also been repaired.

    山西七千多高级社定出今年增产计划
    李顺达等领导的三个社春耕准备做得又快又好
    山西省新建的7，700多个高级农业生产合作社普遍定出今年的增产计划。长治、榆次、忻县等专区的高级社今年将有95％以上的社员收入超过去年。这些社每亩产量都要比去年提高20％到50％。平顺、榆次等县的5个社在取消地界、土地连片和开垦小片荒地以后，就可扩大耕地1，285亩。晋南棉、麦产区许多高级社建立后提出扩大棉田50％以上，并能比去年初级社时增加复播面积一至两倍。五台县秀峰乡先锋高级农林牧生产合作社通过制定劳动定额和对超额的劳动奖励办法，发动社员作个人劳动计划；这样，使全社劳动利用率提高32％。
    全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达、郭玉恩、申纪兰和武侯梨领导的三个生产合作社在社内展开队同队、组同组的增产竞赛以后，使各种春耕准备工作做得又快又好。这些社向全国提出开展农业增产竞赛的倡议后的半个月来，90％以上的社员都冒着严寒、踏着冰雪参加了田间劳动，出勤率比去年同期增加了一倍多。西沟乡“金星”和羊井底乡“红星”两个农林牧生产合作社的全年积肥计划已经完成到60％以上，川底乡“五一”农业生产合作社已经完成积肥计划70％；并且有三分之一的肥料已经运送到地里。为预防春旱，这些社都进行了凿井、积雪保墒工作。各个社春播需用的金皇后等优良品种已经全部经过了检查和翻晒，对一些破旧的农具还进行了修理。　　　（据新华社讯）
