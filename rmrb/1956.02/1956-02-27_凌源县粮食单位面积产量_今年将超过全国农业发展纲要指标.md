    Lingyuan County Grain Yield Per Unit Area
    Will Exceed National Agricultural Development Program Target This Year
    Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, plans to reach a total grain output of 200,000 tons this year, an increase of 122.7% compared to last year. After this plan is realized, the county's land yield per unit area will exceed the target proposed in the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967) by 19.5%, completing it ahead of schedule.
    This year, due to projects such as well-digging and reservoir construction, half of the cultivated land in Lingyuan County will be irrigated, and 50,000 mu (each mu equals 1.5 standard mu, same below) of paddy fields will be opened. It is estimated that the county will increase grain production by 66 million jin from water conservancy alone. Last year, the county planted 5,000 mu of high-yield and double-cropping crops such as corn and potatoes. This year, the plan is to increase this to 350,000 mu, with unit area yields generally expected to increase by 150% to 200% compared to last year. Based on labor conditions, the county also plans to transform 200,000 mu of mountain land this year, which is expected to increase grain production by 8 million jin. In addition, the county can expand the cultivated land area by more than 80,000 mu through land reclamation and eliminating field edges.
    Currently, in order to complete this production increase plan, the communes everywhere are launching a vigorous production upsurge of well-digging, canal building, and manure accumulation. According to statistics from 12 districts, more than 3,900 mu of paddy fields have already been opened, 421 wells have been dug, 85 reservoirs and dams have been built, and 5 million cartloads of fertilizer have been accumulated, exceeding the total amount of fertilizer applied throughout last year.

    凌源县粮食单位面积产量
    今年将超过全国农业发展纲要指标
    辽宁省凌源县计划今年全县粮食总产量达到20万吨，比去年增加122.7％。这个计划实现以后，全县土地单位面积产量将超额19.5％，提前完成1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案中提出的指标。
    凌源县今年由于进行打井和修水库等工程，全县将有一半的耕地得到灌溉，并且开水田5万亩（每亩合1.5市亩，下同）。预计，仅利用水利一项，全县即可增产6，600万斤粮食。去年，全县种植玉米、薯类等高产和二季作物5，000亩，今年计划增加到35万亩，单位面积产量一般都可在去年的基础上提高一倍半到两倍左右。各社根据劳力条件，今年全县还计划改造山地20万亩，预计也可增产粮食800万斤。此外，通过开荒、消灭地边等办法，全县还能扩大耕地面积8万多亩。
    目前，各社为了完成这一增产计划，到处都展开了热火朝天的打井、修渠、积肥的生产高潮。据12个区统计，现在已经开水田3，900多亩，打井421眼，修水库、水坝等85座，积肥500万车，超过了去年全年施肥量的总和。　（据新华社讯）
