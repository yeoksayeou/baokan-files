Xinhua News Agency, February 19th—The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued on February 18th to discuss the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the report of the Central Auditing Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    At the morning session, the delegates warmly welcomed Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Choi Yong-kun, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, who delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress.

    In his congratulatory speech, Hoxha emphasized that the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan is a very significant contribution to the comprehensive strengthening and development of socialist camp countries. Hoxha stressed that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a beacon illuminating the path forward for communist and workers' parties around the world, and we must cherish the great Party of Lenin as we cherish the apple of our eye. Our people will always be grateful to the Soviet Union for its boundless assistance to our country.

    Choi Yong-kun said that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is not only a great event of historical significance for the Soviet people but also for all progressive humanity. The rich experience accumulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union provides valuable guidance for the Korean Workers' Party, as it does for the communist and workers' parties of all other countries. Our party will study the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in depth and creatively reflect these resolutions in all our activities.

    Zhukov of the Moscow Party organization focused on the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and the issue of strengthening the Soviet Union's defense capabilities in his speech. He emphasized that the Soviet Union and the people's democracies are taking measures not only in words but also in deeds to ease international tensions. However, the Soviet people cannot ignore the fact that the policy of international cooperation is being opposed by aggressive blocs. In view of the fact that no agreement has been reached on reducing armed forces and banning atomic weapons, and given that there is still no reliable guarantee of lasting peace, we must have armed forces sufficient to reliably defend the interests of our motherland, so that we are not caught off guard by the enemy's provocations.

    Zhukov said that thanks to the Party and the government's constant concern for the country's defense capabilities, the Soviet armed forces have been thoroughly reorganized and are qualitatively far superior to what they were at the end of the Great Patriotic War. They now have all kinds of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, all types of powerful rockets and jet weapons, including long-range rockets. They have first-class jet aircraft capable of fulfilling any mission that may arise in the event of an attack by aggressors.

    At the afternoon session, attendees listened with great interest to the speech by L. M. Kaganovich.

    Kusinen, a representative from Karelia-Finland, also spoke at the meeting.

    Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress one after another, and were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

    In his congratulatory speech, Truong Chinh emphasized the sympathy and support of the Soviet government and people for the Vietnamese people's liberation war and the work of restoring the national economy after the war. He then read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party to the congress. The congratulatory message stated that the Vietnam Workers' Party and the entire Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that this congress will be a source of new strength for the Vietnamese people in their struggle to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

    In his congratulatory speech, Pollitt emphasized that the Communist Party of Great Britain is unremittingly striving for the unity of the working class, for the realization of a policy of peace, and for social progress. The Communist Party of Great Britain is deeply convinced that the Soviet Union, together with People's China, the people's democracies, the great Indian people, and the people of all capitalist and colonial countries, can shatter the plans of the warmongers and realize the desire of all mankind to establish lasting peace.

    The meeting then read out the congratulatory letter from Tito on behalf of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Alliance of Working People to the congress.

    The afternoon meeting ended here. The congress will continue on February 20th.

    苏共第二十次代表大会继续举行
    据新华社19日讯　苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在2月18日继续讨论苏联共产党中央委员会的报告和苏联共产党中央检查委员会的报告。
    在上午会议上，全体代表热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查和朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长崔庸健向大会致贺词。
    霍查在致贺词的时候强调指出，苏联的第六个五年计划对全面加强和发展社会主义阵营各国是一个非常重大的贡献。霍查强调说，苏联共产党是为全世界的共产党和工人党照亮前进的道路的灯塔，我们要像爱护眼珠一样地爱护伟大的列宁的党。我国人民将永远感谢苏联给予我国的无限的援助。
    崔庸健说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会不仅是苏联人民的而且也是全体进步人类的一个具有历史意义的伟大事件。苏联共产党积累的丰富经验为朝鲜劳动党，正如为所有其他国家的共产党和工人党一样，提供了宝贵的指导。我们的党将深刻地研究苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，并且将创造性地把这些决议反映到我们的一切活动中。
    莫斯科党组织的朱可夫在发言中着重谈到了苏联的和平外交政策和关于加强苏联国防力量的问题。他强调说，苏联和人民民主国家不但在言词上而且在行动上采取措施来缓和国际紧张局势。但是苏联人民不能忽视国际合作的政策受到了侵略集团反对的事实。鉴于在裁减武装部队和禁止原子武器方面还没有达成协议，鉴于目前持久和平还没有可靠的保证，我们必须拥有足以可靠地保卫我们祖国利益的武装部队，以便使敌人的挑衅不致使我们猝不及防。
    朱可夫说，由于党和政府对于国家的防御力量的经常关怀，苏联武装部队已经作了彻底整顿，在质量上远远超过了他们在伟大的卫国战争结束时的水平。他们现在有各种原子和热核子武器，各种型式的威力强大的火箭和喷气武器，包括长射程的火箭在内。他们有第一流的喷气飞机，能够完成一旦遭到侵略者攻击时可能产生的任何任务。
    在下午会议上，到会者以很大的兴趣听了拉·莫·卡冈诺维奇的发言。
    在会上发言的还有卡累利阿—芬兰的代表库西宁。
    越南劳动党中央委员会总书记长征和英国共产党总书记波立特先后向大会致贺词，受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。
    长征在致贺词的时候强调指出了苏联政府和人民对越南人民的解放战争和战后恢复国民经济的工作的同情和支持。他接着宣读了越南劳动党中央委员会给代表大会的贺词。贺词中说，越南劳动党和全体越南人民深信，这次代表大会将是越南人民在为建立和平、统一、独立、民主和繁荣的越南而进行的斗争中的新力量的源泉。
    波立特在贺词中强调指出，英国共产党在坚持不懈地争取工人阶级的团结、争取实现和平的政策和社会进步。英国共产党深信，苏联同人民中国、人民民主国家一道，同伟大的印度人民和所有资本主义国家和殖民地国家人民一道，能够粉碎战争贩子的计划，实现全人类的建立持久和平的愿望。
    会上接着宣读了铁托代表南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和劳动人民社会主义联盟给代表大会的贺信。
