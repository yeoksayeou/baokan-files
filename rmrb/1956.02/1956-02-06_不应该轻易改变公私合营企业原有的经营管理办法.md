    The Original Management Methods of Joint State-Private Enterprises Should Not Be Changed Lightly
    Bian Wen
    The Tianjin Daily published seven letters from readers on its fourth page on February 2nd, criticizing the phenomenon of some joint state-private enterprises experiencing a decrease in turnover and being unable to meet customer needs due to the hasty alteration of original management methods. These criticisms should be brought to the attention of relevant leading departments and resolved quickly.
    According to the analysis of the reader letters, there are two situations in which the original management methods of enterprises are being changed lightly. One is the hasty severance of original supply and sales relationships. For example, the Anli branch of the Tianjin Joint State-Private Bicycle General Store had purchasing agents stationed in other areas before the joint operation. It dealt in more than 30 kinds of bicycle parts produced in Shanghai, Qingdao, Yantai and other places, as well as various rickshaw parts, supplying mainly to supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft production cooperatives, and agricultural production cooperatives in various counties. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership on January 19th, the Tianjin Joint State-Private Bicycle General Store immediately canceled the original stationed purchasing agents and stipulated that all purchases would be made uniformly by the general store. However, the general store did not establish new purchasing relationships in a timely manner, so from the joint operation to February 2nd, no goods were received. Shanghai-produced "Forever" and "Qianmen" brand bicycle saddles are most suitable for rural needs; in the past, as many as arrived would be sold, but now there are none. Recently, a purchasing agent from Qiqihar planned to purchase various bicycle parts worth about 1,300 yuan from the Anli branch, but due to the shortage of goods, he only bought one-third of the original amount.
    The Huadong branch of the Tianjin Joint State-Private Sixth Dried and Fresh Fruit General Store had always purchased pastries from the Fuxiang Pastry Shop before the joint operation. Since the Fuxiang Pastry Shop implemented joint state-private ownership on January 14th, the Tianjin Hebei District Pastry Industry Transformation Work Group instructed the Fuxiang Pastry Shop to no longer allocate goods to the Huadong branch, but to ask the Huadong branch to find a solution from its superiors. As a result, the pastries in this branch were sold out, causing customer dissatisfaction. After the Tianjin Food Company contacted the Pastry Company and the Huadong branch repeatedly sent people to negotiate, the Fuxiang Pastry Shop finally agreed to temporarily allocate ten kilograms of cake on January 29th. As for whether it will continue to supply in the future, the shop could not be sure.
    The Huili branch of the Tianjin Joint State-Private First Shoe and Hat General Store had new styles and a complete range of women's leather shoes before the joint operation, and also made custom-made leather shoes for customers. After the joint operation, the source of goods mainly relied on the supply of the general store. However, most of the leather shoes supplied by the general store were outdated, and customers were unwilling to buy them. Although the general store asked the Huili branch to purchase goods by itself, the shoe factories and handicraft households that used to work for the branch no longer did so after joint operation or cooperativization.
    Another situation is that many complicated business systems and procedures are stipulated for joint state-private enterprises, wasting the energy and time of business personnel and hindering production and business. The Fuxiang branch of the Tianjin Joint State-Private First Sauce Factory used to have only one person responsible for everything from production to sales. Since the joint state-private ownership, this person has been very active, making soy sauce early and late every day, delivering soy sauce to customers, and also taking care of sales in the store. But the general factory sent him more than a dozen forms to fill out, including the Daily Consumption Report of Raw Materials and Materials and the Commodity Sales Report, which had to be submitted every five days. To fill out these forms, he had to work until one or two o'clock every night. On January 30th, the general factory asked him to fill out a report on the production and sales situation for the whole year of last year. There were dozens of items in this report, and he spent two and a half days and one night without finishing it. Now he has not made soy sauce for three nights, and the soy sauce cannot be delivered to users on time.
    Since the implementation of joint state-private ownership, the Honganxiang branch of the Tianjin Joint State-Private Second Shoe and Hat General Store has been very busy every day, and all employees are also very active. However, the general store stipulated a very troublesome procedure for purchasing goods. For each batch of goods purchased, regardless of the quantity, it is necessary to first go to the Second Wholesale Store of the Municipal Department Store to inspect the goods. After inspecting the goods, write a purchase application form. After the application form is written, it is sent to the Business Section of the Second Shoe and Hat General Store for review and approval. After approval, take the application form to the Second Wholesale Store of the Municipal Department Store to collect the delivery note, send the invoice to the Business Section of the Second Shoe and Hat General Store to collect the loan slip, then go to the Accounting Section to exchange for a check (or cash), and finally take the check to the Second Wholesale Store of the Municipal Department Store to pick up the goods. Going through this series of procedures takes at least half a day. On January 23rd, the purchasing agent Zhang Guolin purchased three dozen flannel shirts, seven dozen rubber shoes, and eight dozen socks. It took more than a day from completing the formalities to picking up the goods; before the joint operation, it only took two or three hours to purchase goods. In individual joint state-private stores, the so-called "one invoice per item" system is also implemented for the sake of "easy accounting." For example, some joint state-private cultural and educational supply stores stipulate that a separate invoice must be issued for buying one color of paper; in cotton cloth stores, a separate invoice must be issued for buying one color of cloth. After the implementation of this system, stores that originally did not have queues now have them, adding many unnecessary troubles to business personnel and customers.
    Why does this happen? This is mainly because some comrades who are doing the work of transforming private industry and commerce do not understand that changing the original management methods of enterprises is a very complex task, and they do not understand that after the joint state-private ownership of enterprises is approved, the main thing is not to rush to change their management methods, but to ensure the normal progress of production and business. Therefore, without careful consideration or thorough deployment, they hastily cut off the original supply and sales relationships of enterprises and change business systems. As a result, the old ones are canceled, and the new ones have not been established, thus causing confusion, causing losses to national and social wealth, and causing public dissatisfaction.
    In order to ensure that production and business can still proceed normally after the joint state-private ownership of enterprises, the relevant business leading organs, employees of joint state-private enterprises, engineers, technicians, and industrialists and businessmen should earnestly do their work according to the instructions of Premier Zhou Enlai in the "Political Report" made at the Second Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, that is, "We must pay attention to maintaining the original good varieties, goods, and quality, and it is absolutely not allowed to merge factories and stores or adjust commercial networks at will without the approval of the leading organs, and to easily change service systems and personnel systems. We should carry out reforms in all aspects in a planned and step-by-step manner under the unified leadership and arrangement of the central and local governments to ensure that the socialist transformation work can continue to develop healthily."

### 不应该轻易改变公私合营企业原有的经营管理办法

    不应该轻易改变公私合营企业原有的经营管理办法
    边闻
    2月2日的天津日报第四版，发表了7封读者来信，批评一些公私合营企业因轻易改变原有的经营管理办法致使营业额降低，不能满足顾客需要的现象。这些批评应该引起有关的领导部门注意，迅速地加以解决。
    根据读者来信分析，轻易改变原有企业经营管理办法的情况有两种。一种是草率地切断原有的供销关系。例如天津市公私合营自行车总店安利门市部，合营以前有驻外埠采购员，所经营的上海、青岛、烟台等地出产的各种自行车零件有30多种，另外还有各种人力车零件，供应对象多是各县供销合作社、手工业生产合作社和农业生产合作社等。1月19日实行公私合营以后，天津市公私合营自行车总店便立刻取消了原有的驻外采购员，规定由总店统一采购。但是，总店并没有及时地建立新的采购关系，所以从合营到2月2日，都没有进货。上海产的“永久”、“前门”等牌的自行车鞍子，最适合农村需要，过去来多少卖多少，现在却一个也没有了。最近一个从齐齐哈尔市来的采购员，原来计划从安利门市部购买价值1，300元左右的各种自行车零件，结果因为货缺，只买到原数的三分之一。
    天津市公私合营第六干鲜果总店华东号门市部，合营以前所经营的糕点，一向是从福祥糕饼店购进的。自从1月14日福祥糕饼店实行公私合营以后，天津市河北区糕点行业改造工作组便指示福祥糕饼店不再给华东号门市部拨货，而要求华东号门市部向自己的上级想办法。结果，这个门市部的糕点脱销了，引起顾客的不满。经过天津市食品公司同糕点公司连系，以及华东号门市部一再派人去交涉，1月29日福祥糕饼店才答应暂时拨给十斤蛋糕，至于今后是否继续供应，该店还不能肯定。
    天津市公私合营第一鞋帽总店惠利门市部，在合营以前所经营的女皮鞋样子新，货色齐全，并且还代顾客定做皮鞋，合营以后，货源主要依靠总店供应。而总店所供应的皮鞋花样大部是半老旧的，顾客不愿意买。虽然总店叫惠利门市部自己进货，但是，以前给该门市部做活的制鞋厂和手工业户在合营或合作化以后，都不给做了。
    另一种情况，就是给公私合营企业规定许多繁杂的业务制度和手续，浪费业务人员的精力和时间，妨碍生产和营业。天津市公私合营第一酱料总厂福祥分厂，过去从生产到销货只有一个人。自从公私合营以后，这一个人很积极，每天起早睡晚地做酱油，给顾客送酱油，还照顾门市上卖货，真是越干越带劲。但是，总厂发十多份表报给他填写。其中有的是每天一报的耗用原材料及物料报告表，还有五天一报的商品销售报告表。为了填写这些表报，他每天都得做到晚上一两点钟。1月30日，总厂又叫他填写去年全年的生产和销售情况报告表，这个表里共有几十个项目，他费了两个半天和一宿时间还没弄完。现在他已经有三个晚上没有做酱油了，酱油也不能按时给用户送去。
    天津公私合营第二鞋帽总店鸿安祥门市部，自从实行公私合营以后，每天业务十分紧张，全体职工也很积极。但是总店给它规定一套非常麻烦的进货手续。每进一批货，不论数量多少，都要先到市百货公司第二批发商店看货，看好了货，写购货申请单。申请单写好后，送到第二鞋帽总店业务股审核批准。批准后，拿着申请单到市百货公司第二批发商店领取发货票，把发票再送到第二鞋帽总店业务股领取借款单，然后再到会计股，换取支票（或现款），最后再拿着支票到市百货公司第二批发商店去取货。经过这一连串的手续，起码需要多半天的时间。1月23日那天，采购员张国林去批购了三打绒衣、七打胶鞋、八打袜子，从办手续到把货取来，共用了一天多的时间；而在合营前，进一次货用两三个钟头就够了。在个别的公私合营商店里，还实行所谓“便于结账”的“一货一票”的制度。例如有的公私合营文教用品商店规定买一种颜色的纸张，就要另开一张发票；在棉布店里，买一种颜色的布就要另开一张发票。实行了这种制度以后，原来没有排队买东西的商店，现在也有了，给营业人员和顾客增加了许多不必要的麻烦。
    为什么会发生这样的事情呢？这主要是有些做私营工商业改造工作的同志不了解改变原有企业的经营管理办法是一个很复杂的工作，不了解企业在批准公私合营以后，主要的不是急于改变它们的经营管理办法，而是保证生产和营业的正常进行。因此，他们不经过慎重的考虑，不经过周密的部署，就草率地割断企业原有的供销关系，改变业务制度。结果，旧的被取消了，新的又没有建立起来，因而引起混乱，造成国家和社会财富的损失，引起群众的不满。
    为了保证企业在公私合营以后生产和营业仍能正常进行，有关的业务领导机关、公私合营企业的职工、工程技术人员和工商业者，应该切实根据周恩来总理在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议所作的“政治报告”中的指示去做工作，即“必须注意保持原有的好的品种、货色和质量，决不许可不经领导机关批准，随意并厂并店和调整商业网，轻易改变服务制度和人事制度。应该在中央和地方统一的领导和安排下，有计划有步骤地进行各方面的改革工作，以保证社会主义的改造工作能够继续健康地向前发展”。
