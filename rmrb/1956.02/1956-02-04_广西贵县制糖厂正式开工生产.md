    Guixian Sugar Factory in Guangxi Officially Starts Production
    A large-scale mechanized sugar factory in Guangxi Province—the Guixian Sugar Factory—officially started production on January 23.
    On that day, after the factory's dispatch room issued the start-up order, the entire factory's machines roared. The cane harvester pulled sugarcane into the conveyor belt. After passing through the cane cutter and the榨机(Zha Ji is a type of sugar press), spring-like sugarcane juice poured into the mixed juice tank, and then was pumped to the clarification workshop. From then on, this magnificent sugar factory will supply the country and the people with tens of thousands of tons of sugar and more than ten thousand tons of alcohol every year. (Liang Boming)

    广西贵县制糖厂正式开工生产
    广西省一座规模巨大的机械化制糖厂——贵县制糖厂在1月23日正式开工生产。
    这一天，当这个厂的调度室发出开机命令后，全厂机器轰鸣，扒蔗机将甘蔗扒进输送带，经过切蔗机、压榨机，泉水般的蔗汁便涌进了混合汁箱，然后泵到澄清车间。从此，这个宏伟的制糖厂每年将以数万吨砂糖和一万多吨酒精，供应国家和人民的需要。　（梁伯明）
