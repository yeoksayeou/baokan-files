Chairman, distinguished commissioners, and fellow comrades,

I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and fully agree with the reports of Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Chen Chutong, Dong Biwu, and Commissioner Chen Boda.

In his report, Chairman Zhou Enlai stated, "Our country has the potential to become a completely modernized, highly cultured, and prosperous socialist industrial power in a relatively short period of time." These words have greatly inspired the entire nation and will also galvanize the 12 million overseas Chinese to be even more united and to love our great motherland even more.

From August to November last year, I visited 16 provinces and over 30 cities in Northeast China, North China, Northwest China, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Southwest China, and Central South China. Except for Fuzhou, Yili, and Kunming, which still retain their ancient charm, all other cities have undergone significant changes. Factories are densely packed, streets are wide and straight, skyscrapers stand tall, transportation is smooth, and the environment is clean and beautiful. The face of the country has changed dramatically. Industrial and agricultural production has made tremendous strides, and cultural education and healthcare have also seen corresponding developments. The living standards of the people have improved significantly. All these achievements mark the glorious progress of our socialist construction and prove that socialism makes our motherland prosperous and the people happy, and that socialism is suited to China's national conditions.

The recent outline for national agricultural development proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has set a happy prospect for the entire nation, especially for the 500 million farmers. Everyone is excited and inspired by this prospect. This outline also points out that the task is arduous and requires redoubled efforts and the cultivation of talent. Chairman Mao said, "Everything depends on having cadres, on having a sufficient number of outstanding scientific and technological experts." This statement is very true. I would like to say a few words about the cultivation of talents in maritime, fisheries, and accounting. In recent years, we have not seen an increase in maritime, fisheries, and financial schools; instead, there has been a decrease. Now, with the rapid development of agricultural cooperatives, there is an urgent need for accounting talents. In terms of maritime and fisheries, given the vastness of our territorial waters, the length of our coastlines, and the abundance of our fishing grounds, we need a sufficient number of talents to develop the marine industry. Therefore, I hope that the relevant departments will pay attention to the cultivation of these technical talents.

Another exciting event at this conference is the delegation of workers, peasants, handicraftsmen, and industrialists and businessmen from various places who came to report their good news to Chairman Mao on the opening day. This is indeed a great joy that will shake the world! In less than ten days, the capitalist industries in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Guangzhou have all been fully transformed into joint public-private enterprises. The capitalists and their families have all expressed, "We will follow Chairman Mao's words and walk the path of socialism," joyfully participating in the celebration of the victory of socialist transformation. This powerfully tells the overseas Chinese that the capitalists at home are happily walking into socialist society together with the workers, peasants, and handicraftsmen of the entire nation. It also vividly tells all capitalists around the world that the path taken by China's capitalists is a happy and joyful path, and this path is also the bright road they should take.

Chairman Zhou Enlai has put forward the call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. I believe that this call will soon reach the hearts of the people of Taiwan. Among the 8 million people in Taiwan, nearly 6 million are from southern Fujian. They speak the same language as I do, which is the Xiamen dialect. Many of them are descendants of those who followed the national hero Zheng Chenggong to Taiwan. They have resisted the Qing dynasty's rule there and also resisted the Japanese colonial rulers. Many of them have homes in Taiwan and also in southern Fujian. In recent years, due to the American imperialists' occupation of Taiwan and the traitorous rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, they have not been able to reunite with their fathers, sons, brothers, or communicate with each other, living a painful life. When they hear Chairman Zhou Enlai's concern and call for them, they will surely feel immense warmth and excitement. The construction of the motherland is so glorious, and the changes in the homeland are so great. The Fujian Railway will soon be operational, and the train will go all the way to Xiamen City. They will surely be very excited. Here, I would like to tell the Nationalist Party military and political personnel in Taiwan: The people of Fujian hate your crimes of colluding with American imperialism to enslave the people of Taiwan, but as long as you respond to Chairman Zhou's call, change your ways, and take the path of peaceful liberation of Taiwan to return Taiwan to the motherland's embrace, the people of Fujian will, like the people of the entire nation, treat you generously and not hold past grievances.

Chairman, distinguished commissioners, and fellow comrades:

I fully agree with the reports given by Chairman Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairmen Dong Biwu, Guo Moruo, Li Jishen, Chen Chutong, and Commissioner Chen Boda to the conference.

After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report at this conference, we know that the Party and the government are drafting various plans, strengthening leadership, overcoming shortcomings, and using a series of specific and effective measures to fully mobilize and utilize the potential of the country's existing intellectuals. They are also formulating comprehensive plans to cultivate a large number of new intellectuals to meet the needs of the rapid development of the country's socialist cause. This not only makes us who are participating in this conference very excited but also greatly encourages the intellectuals of the entire nation. The Party and Chairman Mao have such deep concern for the country's existing intellectuals and are so patient in cultivating and educating them. We express our heartfelt gratitude!

Since liberation, the vast majority of China's intellectuals have made significant progress and have achieved great results in their work. At the same time, it is a fact that intellectuals' professional level and political awareness still cannot meet the needs of today's rapidly developing new era in China. I firmly believe that after this encouragement and call from the Party and the government, the vast majority of intellectuals in the country will surely redouble their efforts, continue to educate and transform themselves, further unite around the Communist Party, and wholeheartedly serve socialism. The large army of intellectuals in the country will surely strictly follow the orders of the Party and the government, bravely take the lead in advancing towards modern science, and strive to raise the most urgently needed scientific fields in our country to a level close to the world's advanced level within 12 years.

However, on the other hand, due to the remnants of feudalism and bourgeois ideology in China, and more due to the poisoning of semi-colonial education in China for a hundred years, a very small number of old intellectuals still harbor some unhealthy thoughts today, thus hindering them from exerting positive energy. This is also an undeniable fact. Today, I would like to say a few words from this very small angle. Based on the materials reflected in the inspection of the situation of intellectuals, generally speaking, a very small number of old senior intellectuals, that is, intellectuals who have engaged in political, legal, financial, and economic social sciences in the past, have encountered more difficulties in arrangement and use over the past six years, and thus have more grievances. The formation of this phenomenon, as Chairman Zhou Enlai pointed out, "There are still some irrational phenomena in the use and treatment of intellectuals." But we must also admit that half of the responsibility lies with the intellectuals themselves. This small number of senior intellectuals are older, have absorbed more thoughts from old Chinese society, and have learned a set of social sciences from capitalist countries in Europe and America. After liberation, they found that it was completely wrong, so they felt confused and helpless, finding fault with everything. I am also an old intellectual and an intellectual who studied social sciences in England and America. I understand their feelings. Today, I would like to awaken this very small number of senior intellectuals. We should not be pessimistic and discouraged because we have encountered some difficulties in our work over the past few years. We must realize that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, as long as one does not choose to be eliminated, one can always play a beneficial role and make contributions to the people. At the same time, in the new society, knowledge will always find an appropriate use. How to properly use one's knowledge mainly depends on the efforts of the intellectuals themselves. Over the past few years, there have been many examples where old senior intellectuals who studied social sciences have, after ideological transformation, made new contributions by utilizing their old knowledge. Today, it is not that the Party's estimation of old intellectuals is insufficient, but that a very small number of old intellectuals have insufficient estimation of their own future; today, it is not that the Party's trust in old intellectuals is insufficient, but that a very small number of old intellectuals have insufficient confidence in their own future.

Due to insufficient estimation of their own future, some people admire the two lines of Li Shangyin's poetry: "The setting sun is beautiful, but it is near dusk." Those with "dusk thoughts" say: "The future of the country is bright, but the future of the individual is dim." Therefore, while the whole nation is singing "The East Is Red," he is sighing over the beauty of the setting sun. While the whole nation is full of vigor, he is full of despondency. In reality, this is just a mistake in his stance and perspective. Those who see only the setting sun every day, if they change their stance and perspective, facing east instead of west, and then look forward instead of backward, they will naturally see the red in the east and the rising sun. As long as one does not only consider one's personal interests, but combines one's personal fate with the collective and one's personal fate with the future of the country, one will naturally be excited and happy!

Due to insufficient confidence in their own future, some people have had the thought of "it is better to return home." They often recite Tao Yuanming's "Returning Home" to dispel their worries. Classical literature from the old times can be read and is worth reading. Today, we old-era intellectuals should read a few sentences from Tao Yuanming's "Returning Home": "Realizing the mistakes of the past, knowing that the future can be pursued; the path of error is not far, realizing that today is right and yesterday is wrong." As long as we have the realization that today is right and yesterday is wrong, strive to learn, and strive to transform, we will naturally see new light and find a new future.

Some high-level intellectuals still have varying degrees of "guest" mentality. A very small number of high-level intellectuals are idle in society, or even if they have a position, they have not been assigned appropriate work, and they just sit and wait, but do not actively volunteer to contribute their skills to the country and the people. The Constitution encourages citizens' initiative and creativity in labor. Anyone who uses their labor to seek work is glorious. We should not forget that today is a people's democratic country, and everyone is a master of the state, not a guest official. In such a new country, those with skills should learn from Mao Sui, stand out, and not have the mentality of a guest official, waiting for the "three visits to the thatched cottage." The tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of labor models in the country's industry and agriculture today are all heroes who have stood out with their own skills. Anyone who strives to contribute all their specialties to the country and the people can become a model for the people and a hero for the state.

The few thoughts I have criticized are the thoughts of a very small number of old intellectuals today. With Chairman Mao's instruction to "unite all possible forces" and the Party and the government's call to fully mobilize and utilize the strength of all intellectuals, I believe that this small number of senior intellectuals will surely be quickly and reasonably arranged. I am even more firmly convinced that this very small number of people will surely be greatly moved and encouraged today, and will joyfully accept new tasks and wholeheartedly serve socialism.

Today, China's workers, peasants, and intellectuals have formed a close alliance. This is a very glorious position for China's existing intellectuals. The spiritual and political unity of workers, peasants, and intellectuals is the most important driving force for a socialist society. To ensure the completion of the glorious task of the socialist revolution to Chairman Mao, we must consolidate this alliance and strengthen this driving force. China's existing intellectuals must resolutely unite with workers and peasants, live, work, and advance together on the basis of friendly cooperation, so that the motherland can smoothly and victoriously complete the historical task that has already ripened.

Chairman, distinguished commissioners, and fellow comrades:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Chen Chutong, Dong Biwu, and Commissioner Chen Boda, and I express my heartfelt support.

In the face of the great victory of the movement to safeguard world peace and the brilliant prestige of our country in international affairs, and in the face of the high tide of socialism at home, and in the face of the 40-point outline for agricultural development, and after hearing Premier Zhou Enlai's politically significant report, I am filled with excitement and joy, unprecedented in my life. For the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, Premier Zhou announced five instructions, which are extremely magnanimous to those with reactionary and traitorous crimes. All military and political personnel in Taiwan should immediately repent and strive for an early return to the motherland; the 8 million compatriots in Taiwan should immediately rise up and strive for peaceful liberation.

From the perspective of learning and self-transformation, in addition to seriously studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Chairman Mao, I feel that it is even more necessary to transform one's thoughts through practical experience. In this inspection work, I saw many examples worth learning from:

First, learn from the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants' spirit of unity, mutual aid, and friendship to transform selfish individualism and establish a collectivist mindset. In Qingyuan County, Zhangcun Agricultural Cooperative, in the summer and autumn of 1954, after three middle peasants withdrew from the cooperative, the cooperative president Zhangcun, who is a poor peasant, and the vice-president Chenrong, who is a lower-middle peasant, became even more united with the cooperative members. Especially, they helped seven poor households with their livelihood, overcame difficulties, and survived the disaster. By the autumn of 1955, the small cooperative of 13 households expanded into a large cooperative of 101 households. Zhangcun, the president, said, "The key to running a cooperative is the unity of the members, and poor peasants and lower-middle peasants are easy to unite." There are many such examples. There is no struggle against individualism and sectarianism in their cooperatives, only unity, mutual aid, and friendship. Even when women in the cooperative marry outside, they do not want to leave their cooperative.

Second, learn from the humble learning and sincere acceptance of criticism by the responsible cadres of agricultural cooperatives to transform arrogance, self-satisfaction, and unwillingness to accept criticism. When we visited the cooperatives in Gangzhuang Township, Shenzhou County, Shandong County, and Maozhuang Village, and saw the president of Dongchuanpu Cooperative in Xingtai, the responsible persons of each cooperative said that due to listening to Gang Zhanglu's introduction of cooperative experience and being inspired by it, they established the cooperative and pointed out the shortcomings within the cooperative. Some of the representatives who accompanied us on the inspection criticized their pigpens for being unsanitary, their water conservancy work for being insufficient, their women's work for being poor, and raised many opinions. They all accepted them happily and expressed their thanks. In fact, their cooperatives have many advantages, but they still humbly and sincerely accept criticism and opinions. This is worth learning from intellectuals. I will start with myself.

Third, learn from the spirit of following leadership, frugality, and hard work to overcome slackness, laziness, and wasteful bourgeois ideology. In Qingyuan, Wangliansan's Limin Cooperative is known as the poor peasants' cooperative. The cooperative has no livestock harnesses, using rags and old clothes to twist into ropes; they have no money to buy fertilizer, working hard to accumulate it; they have no farming tools, and the cooperative members borrow plows. Someone said, "This group of poor fellows won't be able to do it." Wangliansan said, "We are poor, but we will get better by following Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao said that even poor peasants can organize." In the autumn of 1955, the cooperative increased production by 40%. Villagers rushed to join his cooperative, saying, "Wangliansan's cooperative works hard and is very frugal. Joining this cooperative is reliable." In Wuan County, Baoyan Township's Construction Cooperative, in 1955, during the drought, women like Wan Zengrong carried 70 jin of soil on their backs all day. When asked if their shoulders hurt, she said, "It won't hurt once you get used to it." In Maozhuang Village, a 70-year-old woman with bound feet, Li Xiangrong, pushed a water cart in a competition to irrigate and plant, and was selected as a labor model. Some cooperatives, during the autumn harvest, to respond to the higher-level call of "precise harvesting and thorough threshing, not a single grain left in the field," the wind and rain blew off the grains from the ears of rice, and women in the fields swept out more than 20,000 jin of grain, achieving a clean field and a clean threshing floor. I saw the farmers working hard from dawn to dusk, and I thought of the living materials, daily necessities, and clothing in the city, all produced by the hard work of the laboring people. If one does not work, one's enjoyment is equal to exploiting the laboring people, which is not in line with the socialist principle of distribution according to work, and one should be vigilant and thoroughly cleanse and transform all bourgeois ideology.

Fourth, learn to stand firmly on the side of the laboring class to overcome liberalism and conservative rightist thoughts. Since the establishment of the mutual aid group in 1943, Gang Zhanglu Cooperative has overcome difficulties such as enemy harassment and attempts to infiltrate. In 1951, when the cooperative developed, rich peasants applied to join, but were rejected. However, some cooperative members developed bourgeois ideology, wanting to develop towards the rich peasants and engage in commerce. After the cooperative criticized this, they were able to maintain their class stance and not be pulled down. There are also many cooperatives of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants that, under the leadership of the Party, stand firmly on the class stance, are not shaken by any external forces, do not bow to any difficulties, and quickly overcome all difficulties; they can quickly accept new things, learn from advanced Soviet experience and agricultural technology, and gradually achieve increased and bountiful production.

Fifth, learn from the spirit of creating through practice to overcome bureaucratism that only talks but does not take responsibility for the people. In Shenzhou County, Shen Chunshuang, the president of the cooperative, is illiterate, but he reports the various production figures and situations of the cooperative very clearly and in detail. He drew a diagram as his mark. He built a windbreak wall in the southeast of the village, ensuring the harvest of several thousand mu of fields. In Jin County, Cao Tongyi Cooperative invented a scientific method of recording work, contracting work and production, dividing into 12 to 16 categories, 13 levels, and 230 items. In Hongqi Cooperative of Mancheng, after the autumn chill, women worked in cold water to dig ditches, leading the cooperative members to open ditches, and overcame the water disaster. In Wuan Construction Cooperative, they dug a pond of three mu and seven fen, two zhang deep, to store water and fight drought, planting one million mu of cotton. In Ninghe County, Niandian Township invented terraced fields, achieving the effect of washing alkali and preventing floods. In Xingtai Yuanxing Cooperative, they planted pine seeds, greening the barren mountains. In Nangong County, Wangdaozhai Cooperative invented a harrow, press cover combined moisture-retaining machine. In Weixian Pioneer Cooperative, they invented a wind-powered mill. In Baoyan Township Cooperative, they invented a powder sprayer. In Xingtai Military Camp Cooperative, they achieved a yield of 802 jin of wheat per mu. In Lingxiu County, Liu Yingqi Cooperative achieved a yield of more than 1,000 jin of white horse teeth corn per mu. In Lincheng County, He Shuxian Cooperative achieved a yield of 16,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. These achievements are all created by the poor people, after liberation, under the guidance and help of various levels of Party committees, from hard work and practice, and are not something that can be achieved by just a few words of the times or irresponsible bureaucratism. I feel that I should learn from the practice of these laboring people, learning from their selfless, limitlessly loyal dedication of their strength.

The above points may have some errors, and I hope fellow comrades will criticize and correct them.

Finally, I am very grateful to Premier Zhou and Vice Chairman Guo for pointing out the bright path to entering socialist society, which is to wholeheartedly serve the people and the direction of alliance with workers and peasants, as well as the methods of self-learning and transformation. This is a rare and precious enlightenment in life. If I do not do this, in the worker-peasant alliance, it seems that there is no need to add a corrupt and useless intellectual, then I will lag behind the times. I do not want to lag behind anyone in socialist society, hoping that everyone can catch up and advance through learning. I do not need to consider my age, but consider how to contribute my strength. I am willing to burn with enthusiasm like a young person, work with workers and peasants for the construction of socialism; I am willing to sing and dance with everyone, celebrating the completion of socialist construction; I am willing to sing with all the laboring people of the country, praising the Communist Party! Chairman Mao!

Chairman, distinguished commissioners, and fellow comrades:

I am a general intellectual and have been engaged in primary school education. Since liberation, I have personally experienced that the Party and the government have always valued and cared for general intellectuals. In addition to organizing us to study for a certain period each week, the Party and the government have also organized political and professional training classes during winter and summer vacations, and many cities have established part-time schools for teachers. In Harbin, many primary school teachers have obtained part-time school graduation certificates equivalent to the level of a normal school. Since liberation, I have participated in eight training classes. The Party and the government have also organized us to participate in the great social movements of land reform, aid to Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Antis" and "Five-Antis," and others, cultivating and tempering our proletarian stance, thoughts, and views. In October 1955, I also followed the Chinese delegation to the Soviet Union to learn advanced teaching experience. All this shows that the Party and the government have always valued and cared for intellectuals in a meticulous way. In Premier Zhou Enlai's and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's reports, they urge us to form a great alliance with workers and peasants, to exert our strength and initiative, and to strive for socialist construction. This is such an exciting thing for intellectuals!

Different types of intellectuals have arduous and glorious tasks in socialist construction. Vice Chairman Guo told us educators: "Those engaged in educational work should improve teaching quality and cultivate a large number of intellectuals for the motherland, so that the ranks of intellectuals can develop from a few million to tens of millions in a short period." It seems that this is the work of high-level intellectuals engaged in higher education and technical education. In fact, it is also very related to primary education. Chickens grow from chicks, and high-level intellectuals are cultivated from primary school students. Primary school students are the reserve force of high-level intellectuals. If primary education does not improve its quality and does not cultivate good primary school students, where will the high-level and middle-level intellectuals who receive university education and technical education come from? Therefore, those engaged in primary education work should also first strive to improve the quality of primary education and cultivate the reserve force of intellectuals. Below, I will discuss a few immature suggestions regarding improving the quality of primary education:

First, improving the quality of teachers is the key to improving education quality. The main reason why the quality of primary education is not high at present is that the level of teachers is far behind the development of the situation. With the development of agriculture, in the "Outline for National Agricultural Development (Draft)" Article 29, it is stipulated that according to local conditions, within 7 or 12 years, the directive to popularize compulsory primary education will be implemented. This means that from now on, we should start to implement compulsory primary education. To achieve the popularization of compulsory primary education, we need to cultivate a large number of primary school teachers, establish more schools, and expand the primary school teacher team. Under such circumstances, to improve the quality of primary education, I think we can organize short-term training classes on the one hand, so that existing teachers can take turns to participate in learning and improve their work ability; on the other hand, we should pay attention to normal education, correct the past tendency of admitting students who failed to enter other schools into normal schools. We should guarantee the quality of normal school students and guarantee that qualified normal graduates are assigned to work in primary schools. As for the problem of lack of teaching experience for these new teachers, we can also encourage experienced old teachers to adopt the method of taking responsibility for apprentices, so that new teachers can absorb the teaching experience of old teachers in teaching practice in time. This way, not only can the political, cultural, and professional level of all primary school teachers be gradually improved, but the quality of education can also be gradually improved.

Second, encourage teachers to actively exert and contribute their potential. Now, most primary school teachers are progressive and work actively. Among them, there are also some teachers whose cultural level and political awareness are relatively high, and whose teaching experience is relatively rich and work is active and hardworking. These people are models for teachers, and their teaching experience can be learned and referred to by the majority of teachers. Various places have been gradually discovering and rewarding outstanding teachers in recent years. However, some places are still afraid that the selected and rewarded teachers are not outstanding enough, or that the selected and rewarded teachers cannot guarantee their excellence for a long time, and dare not take action. This will affect the initiative of primary school teachers and also hinder the improvement of education quality. I hope that education administrative departments at all levels will actively select and reward outstanding teachers, thereby encouraging all teachers to exert their initiative and contribute greater strength to improve education quality.

Third, it is also very necessary to regularly inspect school work, help teachers summarize experience. Education administrative departments inspecting school work can not only promote and encourage teachers' work enthusiasm but also conveniently understand the situation and provide specific help in time; for those experienced teachers who do not know how to summarize, their experience can be discovered, and they can be helped to summarize, so that a large number of primary school teachers across the country can learn their experience in time and improve education quality together.

In addition, the Party and the government have always cared for the treatment and welfare of primary school teachers, and in recent years, they have been continuously improving and improving. However, at present, there are still some teachers who, due to their large families and lack of labor, have the situation of eating less and wearing less. The difficulties of rural teachers are even greater. Female teachers with young children, because their children cannot enter kindergartens and nurseries, have to work and take care of their children at the same time. These situations cannot be said to have no impact on their work. In order to enable all primary school teachers to concentrate on their work and improve education quality, I hope that the relevant departments will, under possible conditions, appropriately take care of and solve these problems.

The above are my hopes for the education administration and financial departments. We primary school teachers should realize that our level in all aspects is still very poor, and there are many shortcomings in our thoughts and work. In the future, in addition to continuously carrying out ideological transformation and striving to learn Marxism-Leninism theory, we need to deeply learn from the advanced teaching experience and high-level socialist labor attitude of the Soviet Union. This time, I went to the Soviet Union to visit, and I saw that their primary schools are all well-run. The teachers are almost all education experts. They not only master educational theory but also have skilled teaching skills. The quality of education is naturally very high. If we can study their teaching experience and learn from their socialist labor attitude, and then exert our creativity, we will not find it difficult to improve our teaching quality.

I believe that all primary school teachers will strive to improve their cultural, political, professional level, and socialist awareness in the new situation and will not be content to lag behind the new situation. I am willing to work with all primary school teachers in China to continuously learn, unite, and transform, and with a socialist labor attitude, cultivate well-rounded primary school students for the country and contribute all our strength to cultivating a large number of intellectuals.

Chairman, distinguished commissioners, and fellow comrades:

I fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo, Li Jishen, Chen Chutong, Dong Biwu, and Commissioner Chen Boda. I am filled with twelve million times the enthusiasm to welcome the mission entrusted by the Party to intellectuals and am full of confidence that under the Party's correct leadership, we will surely catch up with the world's advanced scientific level in twelve years. There is no doubt that this is a very arduous task facing intellectuals, but I believe that as long as we intellectuals can correctly understand the great significance of this mission, closely unite around the Party, and under the Party's correct leadership, we will surely complete this glorious task.

First, intellectuals should recognize the creativity of the working class. In complex and profound scientific research work, we should closely cooperate with workers to exert collective strength. This way, we will not deviate from reality and can apply the research results to the construction of socialist production. Since liberation, there have been too many facts on the industrial and agricultural fronts where intellectuals, by cooperating with workers in technology, have made significant contributions.

Second, we should sincerely learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to production technology. Because the scientific achievements of the Soviet Union are the collective crystallization of many scientists and have been tested in their socialist construction and production process, they are correct. Therefore, we must correct our attitude and learn to apply them. We must not, because we are scientists, think that learning and applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union will lower our status in the scientific community; nor should we emphasize difficulties, saying that conditions are different, equipment is different, and it is impossible to apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in China. These are all due to individualism and do not consider the overall cause of socialism, which will weaken our strength.

I am a mechanical manufacturing heat treatment technician. Since liberation, I have deeply understood the advanced and complete nature of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and because I have closely relied on the Party, in my work, I have closely cooperated with workers, not only solving the most complex production problems on simple equipment by using the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but also generally improving the technical level of workers and myself. I feel that my previous technology was scattered, but now, after learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, I feel that I have a complete set of systematic technical experience from beginning to end. Without the cultivation of the Party, I would not have today's achievements. I will study harder in the future and get closer to the Party.

The superiority of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can be illustrated by a factual example. In the heat treatment of aluminum alloy, the British and Americans only told us to use pure sodium treatment. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, told us to use sodium salt treatment, which not only extended the effective time of the alloy but also ensured the stability of magnesium, making the casting meet the mechanical performance requirements. When using the experience of the British and Americans, due to the unqualified elongation rate, we could not find the reason for the scrap, and we blamed the workers for not operating properly. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union told us that due to the rapid volatilization of sodium, it increased the volatilization of magnesium, and this is how we found the answer in learning the experience of the Soviet Union.

Third, we must rely on the Party. Most of us intellectuals have a mentality of being proud and self-satisfied, staying if it suits us, and leaving if it doesn't. Therefore, as soon as we encounter something unpleasant, we have the idea of leaving and finding another job. This is actually wrong. The Party cares for intellectuals, but because we do not get close to the Party, we divide the Party into you and me, draw a line, still use old thoughts to deal with revolutionary work, have not connected the fate of the Party with our own, have not seen clearly what work the Party is doing for the people, and have not established a revolutionary worldview of dedicating oneself to the motherland, binding oneself in the small courtyard of personal gain and loss, thus creating a confrontation with the Party. This is not the majority, but there are still quite a few. In this way, the distance from the Party becomes greater and greater, feeling that the Party does not trust me, and I have nothing to do. In fact, it is myself who is causing the trouble. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, we should know that the Party loves us, cares for us, and is meticulous in every detail. In the future, we must rely on the Party, under the Party's correct leadership, contribute all our strength, and complete the work expected of us by the Party.

Finally, I would like to express two wishes:

First, in Premier Zhou's report, it is mentioned that there are still some problems in the use and treatment of intellectuals. In my personal experience, I feel that compared to before liberation, the living treatment is like heaven and earth. Before liberation, I taught at the reactionary government's Guizhou University, and the monthly salary I received in gold yuan had to be exchanged for silver dollars at the silver dollar dealer's place, with only one or two yuan per month, which could not maintain life, and I had to sell clothes and pawn things. In the end, I and my wife and four-year-old daughter were forced to open up wasteland to grow vegetables to eat. After liberation, I live a very comfortable life. Therefore, in terms of treatment, I think the Party has done everything for us. Moreover, the country is building socialism, and money is needed everywhere, so we should not raise our living standards too high.

However, we still need to improve our treatment. I request the Party to consider appropriately improving the political treatment of intellectuals so that we can be closer to the Party in our thoughts, so that we can better exert our collective strength.

Second, my eldest child has recently enlisted in the army, and the physical examination is also qualified. He said that he will serve in the army with a heart full of love for the motherland and strive to become a loyal and brave soldier of the Party in the future, and encourage me to contribute all my knowledge and strength to the socialist construction of the motherland and forever maintain the honorable title of the top labor model of Shanxi Province. I think I have the confidence to transform myself and guarantee the realization of this wish.

Chairman, distinguished commissioners, and fellow comrades:

I wholeheartedly support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. I would like to say a few words about the part of Chairman Zhou's report on the liberation of Taiwan to the Nationalist Party's diplomatic personnel in Taiwan.

When the people of all sectors and ethnic groups in the motherland, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, are joyfully and enthusiastically carrying out the unprecedented great cause of socialist construction that our ancestors have never done, I cannot help but miss the Nationalist Party's diplomatic personnel who fled to Taiwan and those who remained overseas. Most of them are my old friends. I dare to say that most of them are not willing to sell out the country and are not completely without patriotism. Therefore, I would like to give them some advice.

The Nationalist Party's diplomatic personnel in Taiwan can be roughly divided into three categories: one category is in Taiwan, one category is outside Taiwan, and another category is those who have been dismissed by the Nationalist Party but are still stranded overseas. Most of those in Taiwan are not die-hard reactionaries. They all feel extremely frustrated, disillusioned, and hopeless there. They know that what lies before them is only a bleak and miserable future. They have no illusions about the Chiang Kai-shek clique and only think about their personal and family interests. What plans do they make? No matter how high or low their positions are, none of them do not day and night hope to be transferred to a foreign country to serve as a fake diplomat, thus escaping the prison of Taiwan. This is their unanimous and only "highest ideal." However, under the support of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek clique still has a few fake embassies and consulates abroad, but due to their shrinking scope of activities in the international arena, like the novel "The Skin of an Ass" by the 19th-century French realist writer Balzac, they are getting smaller and smaller every day. Therefore, those who can escape the prison of Taiwan and realize their "highest ideal" are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, very few. Therefore, most of them can only resign themselves to fate, locked in the prison of Taiwan, living day by day, and secretly lamenting, which is certain.

What about the Nationalist Party's diplomatic personnel outside Taiwan? Since they have escaped the prison of Taiwan, they should be rejoicing, right? This is not necessarily the case. They generally have three fears: first, they fear that funds will not come, making them unable to live overseas; second, they fear that they will be laid off, making them unable to advance or retreat; third, they fear that the government of the country they are stationed in will change its policy and negotiate with the People's Republic of China, thus having to close the fake embassy, at which time, they dare not return to the fire pit of Taiwan, and they can only drift overseas, becoming "white Russians." These three fears are inevitable results, but what use is it for them to just be afraid?

As for those who have been dismissed by the Nationalist Party but are still stranded overseas, what is their state of mind? Since the complete liberation of the motherland, the so-called "Foreign Ministry" of Taiwan has repeatedly closed embassies and laid off employees, and salaries have been reduced. To be frank, those who have been laid off or resigned have grievances against the Nationalist Party and generally dare not return to Taiwan, falling into the trap. Most of them either drift overseas, becoming "white Russians"; or live in Hong Kong, relying on the little savings left behind in the past, which are now almost used up, and are beginning to live a wandering life like "stateless people." Their state of mind is quite sad. Their lives are quite miserable. Their thoughts are also quite foolish. They have been poisoned by imperialist propaganda and lies, and threatened by reactionary spies, so they do not dare to believe that as citizens of today's great motherland, they will really have such freedom and happiness. Although they sometimes cannot help but miss their hometowns and relatives in their hometowns, they are hesitant about various concerns and do not dare to imagine that returning to the motherland will really receive the generous treatment of the people of the motherland.

The general thoughts of the Nationalist Party's diplomatic personnel in Taiwan and outside Taiwan, as well as the old diplomatic personnel who have been dismissed by the Nationalist Party but are still stranded overseas, are roughly like this. Incidentally, in addition to these three categories of personnel, there are also Chinese staff in various international organizations. They are not directly appointed by the Nationalist Party in Taiwan but maintain an indirect relationship with the Nationalist Party in Taiwan. They hold the identity of "international staff" and still maintain a wait-and-see attitude towards the motherland. Some of them are treated unfairly and endure it silently. Their positions are unstable. Their state of mind is also frustrated. Therefore, what I say here is also effective for them.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 18th.

They have a way out, don't they? I said: Their way out has been clearly pointed out by Chairman Zhou Enlai in his report. Chairman Zhou Enlai said in his report: "Now, among the Nationalist Party military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan, there must be many who are willing to return to the mainland through peaceful means. They all have families or relatives living on the mainland, and many want to return to the mainland to reunite with their families or relatives. We call on all Nationalist Party military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan and overseas to not hesitate any longer, and to take the path of peaceful liberation of Taiwan as soon as possible! Therefore, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, hereby announce: Those who wish to return to the mainland to visit relatives and friends can come back to the mainland. Those who wish to come to the mainland to visit and study can also come to the mainland. Those who wish to take the path of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, regardless of who they are, and regardless of how serious their past crimes were, the Chinese people will treat them leniently and will not pursue past offenses. Those who perform meritorious deeds in the action of peaceful liberation of Taiwan will be rewarded according to the size of their merits. Those who turn to the motherland through peaceful means will be given appropriate positions in their work."

It must be pointed out: "All Nationalist Party military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan and overseas" naturally also include all Nationalist Party diplomatic personnel in Taiwan and overseas. I hope they will read this passage carefully and repeatedly. I think that if someone among them reads this passage, they will not be unmoved. It is clear that this passage points out the way out for them. Facts are the most persuasive. In the early days of national liberation, the Communist Party of China and the people's government adopted a policy of "taking in" all old personnel who did not have obvious reactionary behavior. In the past few years, the vast majority of old personnel have already become good cadres of the people's government. Just take the old diplomatic personnel, for example! Many of my old friends returned to the country after that, and the party and the government treated them with the principle of "recruiting according to ability," making appropriate arrangements for them in various aspects and giving them suitable positions. Some of them are now making full use of their expertise and are valued by the government. Just take me, for example! I was engaged in Nationalist Party diplomatic work for a full 16 years. Since October 1949, when I and a few other friends announced our withdrawal from the Nationalist Party in Paris, and May 1950, when I returned to the country, the warmth, trust, and appreciation that the party and the government have shown me are truly indescribable.

Chairman Zhou Enlai has already pointed out this bright way out for them in his report. What are they still hesitating about? What are they still worried about? The Chinese people will definitely liberate Taiwan, and Taiwan will definitely be liberated. For the Nationalist Party military and political personnel in Taiwan and overseas, as well as those who have been dismissed by the Nationalist Party but are still in exile overseas, do they want to return to the mainland to reunite with their families? Or are they willing to persist in the path they are now taking, which leads to a dead end? There is a Western proverb, "All roads lead to Rome." They can take appropriate measures according to their different specific situations. They can publicly respond to Chairman Zhou's call and stand under the banner of patriotism to fight for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. They can quietly "turn to the motherland through peaceful means." They can also adopt an attitude of reservation towards the motherland and return to visit. However, the time allowed for them to make a choice is not much. Do not hesitate any longer, this is the last opportunity. Wake up and make a decisive decision!

Liu Yaozhang's Speech

Chairman, fellow committee members, and comrades:

I fully support Premier Zhou's political report.

Premier Zhou's report said: "Our government has repeatedly pointed out in the past year: In addition to liberating Taiwan through military means, there is also the possibility of liberating Taiwan through peaceful means." And he called on: "Taiwan compatriots and all those who fled to Taiwan from the mainland, stand under the banner of patriotism, together with the people of the motherland, struggle for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the complete unification of the motherland!" When I heard this, I immediately thought of the Nationalist Party military and political personnel in Taiwan, and I also thought of the situation in Beijing before and after the peaceful liberation, and of myself, who was then the mayor of Beijing.

Long before the peaceful liberation of Beijing, the surrounding areas had already been liberated one after another, and the city of Beijing was in a state of stagnation. Not only was the market sluggish and chaotic, but the poverty of the people had reached its extreme. Under these circumstances, the peaceful liberation of Beijing could not but become a pressing demand from all sides. In fact, the peaceful liberation of Beijing did achieve: the lives and property of 2 million people were not harmed, the historical relics of several hundred years were not destroyed, and the original Nationalist Party military and political personnel, including myself, were all treated leniently.

At that time, the benefits of peaceful liberation were obvious to everyone, and what I was most worried about was my own future. Because, before the liberation of Beijing, I had no contact with the Communist Party, no, and I even regarded the Communist Party as the object of political struggle, so I could not have a correct understanding of the Communist Party. Especially during the peaceful liberation negotiations, my thoughts and emotions were very complicated, with great fluctuations—regretting the Nationalist Party, resenting Chiang Kai-shek, and feeling fear and doubt towards the Communist Party. I feared war, but also feared that it would not stop; I wanted peace, but also feared changes halfway; I had thought of leaving Beijing, but did not know where to settle. However, fortunately, I finally stayed.

Not long after the liberation, although I had little contact with the Communist Party, what I heard and saw made my fears and doubts disappear. Soon I was assigned to the Ministry of Water Resources as the director of the office, which showed the Communist Party's trust in me. In the past few years, I have often received education from the Communist Party and help from all sides in my work. Recently, when I went to Hebei for an inspection, I saw the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in New China and the improving living conditions of the peasants. In the past 7 years, my body has become stronger than before, my spirit has become more vigorous, and the content of my life has become fresher and richer. In working and living with the young people, I unconsciously forgot that I was already 60 years old. In fact, it was not only me, but all the old friends I knew who did not leave Beijing before and after the liberation. As long as they were willing to serve the people sincerely, they all had appropriate work and lived a better life than before.

Since February 1949, when the People's Liberation Army officially entered the city, I have seen Beijing changing day by day from a state of dilapidation, poverty, filth, and chaos. Not only have various constructions been developed rapidly, making Beijing's appearance completely renewed, but the face of every citizen of Beijing, seen from their happy, tense, lively, and enthusiastic expressions, has also changed completely. New factories are being completed one after another. Countless new buildings are rapidly changing the appearance of this ancient city. Idlers who do not work are rarely seen. In the suburbs, the peasants, who had been suffering from year after year of increased production, no longer have worried and sad faces. Due to the gradual increase in people's income, people's purchasing power has greatly increased. The number of students in each middle school has generally developed to the thousands, and universities and specialized colleges have increased by many times. Groups of beggars, hooligans, and even thieves have all turned to labor and production. A new type of social order has been established. The relationship between people has become especially close, sincere, and friendly. Flies, mosquitoes, and rats are about to disappear. The entire new Beijing, not only is the political, economic, and cultural center of the people of the whole country, but is also the city most loved by our international friends. This specifically shows that the government after liberation is a government that truly serves the people, and the people after liberation truly live a happy life.

Now, the Nationalist Party military and political personnel who are stranded on the island of Taiwan are controlled by the military power of American imperialism, plunging the people of Taiwan into a sea of suffering. The people of Taiwan, who have a revolutionary tradition of struggling for freedom and liberation, will never be willing to live a life of slavery under foreign rule. At the same time, when our great motherland is striving towards socialism, we cannot but be deeply concerned about the fate of the people of Taiwan. Therefore, the people of the motherland will definitely liberate Taiwan, and Taiwan will definitely be liberated. If the military and political personnel in Taiwan still hope that American imperialism will "feed and kill" them, then, as Premier Zhou said: "History has proven that invaders will inevitably fail, and those who rely on invaders to prolong their lives will either fail with them or be sacrificed."

If they can wake up and help in the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, not only will they eliminate the disasters caused by foreign military rule for the people of Taiwan, but they will also enable the people of Taiwan to march forward with the people of the motherland in the future. At the same time, for the military and political personnel who take the path of peaceful liberation, they will have made a contribution to the motherland by returning Taiwan to the motherland, and they will also have made a contribution to the peace of Asia and the world, which is their bright way out.

My situation in Beijing before the peaceful liberation and the situation of the military and political personnel in Taiwan today are basically similar. Before the liberation of Beijing, my mental state was also basically similar to that of the military and political personnel in Taiwan today. However, my situation after the liberation of Beijing and the situation of the military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan are fundamentally different. The problem is very clear, and the path is also very clear. What are the military and political personnel in Taiwan still hesitating and observing for? They might say: It's too late. Yes, it is too late. But if they do not strive today, it will be even later tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. They might also think: The assurances in Premier Zhou's report about lenient treatment and appropriate arrangements may not be reliable? This doubt is understandable, but the ironclad facts—the facts that I personally experienced—after the liberation of Beijing have already fully answered this question.

Premier Zhou said: "All the Chinese people, including the people on the mainland and the people of Taiwan, should unite under the banner of patriotism and work together to solve this matter that belongs to our internal affairs." This call is absolutely correct and absolutely timely. I hope that the military and political personnel in Taiwan will make a quick decision and catch up, so that Taiwan can return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, to realize the complete unification of the People's Republic of China.

Wu Jianxian's Speech

I am a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Chongqing who has studied medicine for 10 years and practiced for 40 years. Now, the party and the people's government have instructed that traditional and Western medicine should exchange knowledge, and I am attending the second session of the second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Yesterday, I heard a nurse say that the mortality rate of measles in children was in the tens of thousands within a year. Also, encephalitis B in children—traditional Chinese medicine calls it "summer convulsion"—in the past, hospitals would first extract spinal fluid, and the mortality rate was also very high.

Let me explain these two childhood diseases separately: 1. Measles are caused by fetal toxins in the mother's womb, commonly known as an infectious disease. If the temperature is too high, people often use anti-inflammatory drugs, causing the measles not to fully erupt, or open windows to let in air and catch a cold, causing the fetal toxins not to be expelled and return to the body, often resulting in an incurable condition. Traditional Chinese medicine treats measles by using diaphoretic drugs (modified Shuanghuang Lianhua Decoction) when the rash is just starting to appear. Even if the rash is not fully erupted, fever may be severe, but anti-fever drugs should not be used. After three or four days, when the rash appears on the palms and soles, it can be treated according to the symptoms. If the rash appears on the chest and back, but the hands have not reached the elbows and the feet have not reached the knees, one must be very careful to avoid catching a cold. Avoid using overly cold or heavy sedative and astringent drugs. If there is a mistake, it often leads to the return of toxins and death. I have treated measles for many years and have an experienced prescription for treating measles returning toxins: use two black sunflower shells, boil them, and apply them while hot, wiping with a dry towel. Pay attention to applying heat to the cold areas of the palms and soles, and if the chest and back are also affected, apply heat to the entire body. Apply heat and wipe dry repeatedly, being careful to avoid catching a cold. If the palms and soles appear, there is nothing to worry about. This is a special effective prescription for treating measles returning toxins.

Now, let me talk about "summer convulsion" (also known as sudden fright and new name encephalitis B), which often occurs in children after the summer solstice. This is caused by summer heat entering the heart and rising to the brain, resulting in convulsions, twitching, and rolling eyes. In the past, hospitals would first extract spinal fluid, often causing encephalitis and death. Traditional Chinese medicine uses heart-clearing and stomach-clearing drugs, which are effective in about 90% of cases. For example, Qingying Decoction, Zishui Dan, and Qingxin Decoction are the correct methods for clearing the heart. For those with strong liver qi, use Qingre Zhenjing Decoction. For severe encephalitis, use Shigao Qingwei Decoction. These are experienced prescriptions for treating summer convulsion in children. There are also cases where children vomit and have diarrhea, with cold hands and feet, mild convulsions, and slightly upward-looking eyes or a cold nose. This is called "scattered wind from the spleen." One should use Wenzhong Bupi Decoction, which is the opposite of sudden fright. Be very careful not to use cold drugs. If used incorrectly, it can kill people, and it is the doctor's fault. In 1955, I took on the position of director of the first traditional Chinese medicine hospital in Chongqing. In the summer, 13 children with summer convulsion were admitted, none of whom had spinal fluid extracted. Using Qingying Decoction and other prescriptions, 12 were cured. One child was too weak and died after a month in the hospital. Another factory sent two children with summer convulsion, who had already had spinal fluid extracted by the factory doctor, and their condition worsened. They were quickly sent to my hospital by train but could not take medicine. They were sent in two batches, both late at night, and died before dawn. My colleagues advised me not to mention the words "extract spinal fluid" to avoid offending my colleagues in the new scientific medical field, but I saw too many children dying, so I want to be a true traditional Chinese medicine practitioner who exchanges knowledge with new scientific practitioners. I am willing to be a straightforward friend of new scientific practitioners, and I do not mind being criticized or blamed.

There is also an acupuncture group's speech draft, but the time is pressing, and I cannot say everything.

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Jian Yongning and Huang Heng's Joint Speech

Chairman, fellow committee members, and comrades:

We are honored to represent China's athletes and attend such a grand meeting. Our hearts are filled with joy and excitement. We wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's "political report" and the reports of other leaders.

Before liberation, China's sports were extremely backward. Under the rule of imperialism and the reactionary Nationalist Party, not only was there no achievement in sports, but the enthusiasm of the people to participate in sports was also severely suppressed. Huang Heng was originally a hired farmer, and I was originally a small clerk. Although we have always loved sports, due to life difficulties or simply not having the opportunity to participate in sports, or not being able to train regularly, it was difficult to improve our performance. After liberation, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "develop sports and strengthen the people's physique," and with the support and care of the party and the people's government, China's sports have become a people's cause, serving the broad laboring masses. Only then, like other construction projects, did it develop vigorously and make us become athletes of the people, representing the motherland to participate in international competitions. My ping-pong skills have also improved under the care and support of the party and the government, enabling me to win the second place in men's singles at the Second World Youth Festival and the Second International Youth Sports Meeting, bringing honor to the motherland.

Currently, China's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce are advancing at high speed. However, the imperialist bloc led by the United States is constantly shouting about war and creating international tension. American imperialists are occupying our territory of Taiwan with military force and constantly provoking us with war. These situations make us deeply realize the importance of sports for production construction and national defense construction. Because the purpose of sports is to strengthen the people's physique, so that the people have a healthy body and a strong will, they can better serve production and national defense, and strive for the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan and the liberation of Taiwan.

In recent years, China's sports have developed significantly, but they are still far from meeting the needs of China's economic construction and national defense construction. The participation of the masses, especially the workers and peasants, in sports is still not widespread. In schools with better conditions, only about 2.33 million students participate in the Labor and Defense Physical Fitness Program or the preparatory level. The technical level is also very low, and except for a few projects, most are far behind the international level. China's sports in the international arena are still far from comparable to China's international political status. All this makes us deeply feel the great responsibility of being a glorious Chinese athlete.

We are able to attend this conference, which fully shows the party and the government's attention and support for the sports cause and their care and concern for athletes. Premier Zhou and other leaders' reports, as well as the speeches of all comrades, have given us profound education and inspiration. We will, like all athletes, definitely not disappoint the party, Chairman Mao, and the government's care and expectations. We will study hard in the future, continuously improve our communist consciousness, train hard, and strive to improve our technical level, promote the development of domestic mass sports, and achieve greater victories in international competitions, so that China's sports can quickly become popular among the broad masses of the people and catch up with or surpass the international level in technology.

Lu Qi's Speech

Chairman, fellow committee members, and comrades:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's political report and the important reports of other leaders.

I am an ordinary practicing doctor. Being able to attend this conference and participate in national affairs is the greatest honor given to me by the people, and I feel extremely excited and honored.

The party and Chairman Mao call on us to catch up with the world's advanced level of science and culture in a short period of time. After being inspired by this great call, we intellectuals naturally think about how to respond to this great call and strive for it. As a medical worker, I think that implementing the party's policy of uniting traditional and Western medicine, doing a good job of academic exchanges, and excavating and carrying forward the precious medical heritage of the motherland should also be a way to strive for. Now, let me talk briefly about this issue based on my work practice.

I am a Western medicine doctor who specializes in surgery. Among surgical diseases, hemorrhoids are a common and widespread disease. Western medicine has many methods for treating hemorrhoids, such as ligation, cauterization, and excision, which have some effects but cause more pain. Later, I learned the traditional Chinese medicine method for treating hemorrhoids, refined a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that has been passed down among the people, and combined it with Western medical instruments to create the "internal hemorrhoid insertion therapy." The results were highly effective, the operation was simple and convenient, the cost was low, and the patient did not suffer during the treatment. In my more than ten years of clinical practice, the cure rate was about 80%.

However, in the old society, due to my bourgeois "patent" mentality and the fact that society looked down on traditional Chinese medicine, I was afraid that people would know that I used traditional Chinese medicine, so I would be ridiculed. Therefore, I kept the "internal hemorrhoid insertion therapy" a strict secret and did not tell anyone. So the treatment objects were limited to a few patients who came to me for treatment. At the same time, my personal abilities were limited, and there was little improvement in technology. Now, looking back, I feel deeply ashamed. After liberation, under the influence of several great social reforms, I realized that I should make more contributions to the people's health cause. In 1953, I voluntarily expressed my attitude to the people's government, and soon I received the government's attention and cultivation. I was assigned to have colleagues with academic status in the medical field help me, guide me in the Second Hospital of Zhejiang Medical College to conduct experiments, summarize experience and shortcomings, and quickly improve and develop the "internal hemorrhoid insertion therapy" technology. According to the results from March 1954 to June 1955, 115 patients were treated with this method, and 109 were cured, with a cure rate of 94.8%. In 1955, the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department also gathered some medical and pharmaceutical colleagues to hold a "internal hemorrhoid insertion therapy" training class. I disclosed the entire prescription without reservation and worked with everyone to study it. Now it has begun to be widely promoted and applied under the leadership of the government.

The "internal hemorrhoid insertion therapy" was originally the precious experience accumulated by our ancestors in their long struggle against hemorrhoids. As long as we inherit it, we can apply it to the people's health cause and add luster to the medical science of our motherland. However, compared to the rich medical heritage of our motherland, the treatment of hemorrhoids is only a drop in the bucket. There are still many other aspects waiting for us to excavate and carry forward.

In the reality of the rapid improvement and widespread application of the "internal hemorrhoid insertion therapy," I am deeply moved by the party's correct leadership of science and technology and the government's careful care for people's health. I decided to join the national medical institutions and, under the direct leadership and education of the party, and with the guidance and help of colleagues in the medical field, strive to improve my political and professional levels and strive for the development of the culture and science of our motherland.

Gu Jinxin's Speech

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou and the reports of other leaders.

I firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we will definitely achieve the great socialist transformation and construction of our motherland.

We intellectuals, after six years of personal experience and feeling, should deeply realize: only by following the Communist Party can we save the country and the people; only by following the Communist Party can we change customs and eliminate disasters, and move towards the bright and happy road; only by following the Communist Party can we study science and quickly catch up with the world's technical level. Because only the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao can truly serve the people selflessly; can unite and transform the people of the whole country, and work together to build a socialist society; can think deeply and plan comprehensively, and continuously improve the material and cultural life of the people. Many of us intellectuals did not understand Marxism-Leninism before liberation, did not understand the Communist Party, and took many detours. Our teeth grew old, not only did we not play the role of intellectuals, but because of individualism and bourgeois ideology, we unknowingly did some anti-people things. Now we should correct our mistakes, catch up, and work with the workers and peasants to give full play to everyone's initiative and creativity, and strive to build a socialist society. In the future, I will not only measure myself by the standard of a Communist Party member, reform myself; not only understand Marxism-Leninism and follow the Communist Party, but also strive to achieve merit in work and strive to join the party, become the vanguard of socialist construction, and become a true Marxist-Leninist engineer.

I am a petroleum industry worker. Everyone knows that petroleum is an indispensable resource for industry, agriculture, national defense, and transportation; without petroleum, cars, tractors, and airplanes cannot operate. However, this is precisely the weakest link in the current development of our national economy. In the past six years, under the correct leadership of the party and the government, on the one hand, we organized forces to conduct a nationwide survey, actively explored and drilled for natural petroleum resources, and on the other hand, we vigorously developed shale dry distillation, coal dry distillation, coal gasification, gas synthesis, and high-pressure hydrogenation and other artificial petroleum. We petroleum industry workers firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the party and Chairman Mao, we will definitely find a lot of natural petroleum and produce a large amount of artificial petroleum to meet the needs of the motherland.

Now, let's talk about the shale dry distillation industry. In the past six years, the original oil production has increased by about 10 times. The small pieces of shale that were previously unusable and discarded are now mostly utilized. The operation technology of shale dry distillation has also made great progress. In the past, it took about 35 tons of raw shale to produce one ton of original oil, but now it can be produced from about 28 tons of raw shale. To reduce losses and increase production, we are implementing technical measures based on the suggestions of Soviet experts and the experimental results of our shale dry distillation factories, to recover the light oil (which can be made into gasoline after refining) that was not utilized in the past from the shale dry distillation gas; at the same time, we will also add shale preheating equipment to greatly increase the processing capacity of the original shale dry distillation kilns. After these two technical measures are implemented, without considering the expansion and new construction, the current production of original oil in China's shale dry distillation industry can be increased by more than 40%. We petroleum industry workers are also actively studying the dry distillation and gasification conditions of shale dry distillation kilns, as well as the type of kilns, and will further study the effective utilization of shale granules and powder. We are fully confident that within five years, we can achieve the goal of producing one ton of oil from 20 tons of raw shale. We also believe that the shale dry distillation kiln of the Fushun type, after adding preheating and improving the ventilation and gasification conditions, will become one of the world's advanced shale dry distillation kiln types.

Of course, the artificial petroleum industry is a young and complex industry. We urgently need to learn advanced technology and experience, and at the same time, we must rely on the support of the machinery industry and the coal industry and other departments, and more importantly, we need the attention and support of the people of the whole country. I am full of confidence that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and with the help of Soviet and other people's democratic countries' experts, the artificial petroleum industry in our country will definitely achieve brilliant and magnificent development and achievements within 12 years, reaching the world's artificial petroleum technical level.

Finally, I think that reading more technical materials and exchanging technical experience is the key to improving scientific and technological levels and is an indispensable thing for engineering and technical personnel to grow and develop their skills. In recent years, due to the improper handling of some cadres in the work of secrecy, they often seal documents as confidential or top secret as long as there are numbers or blueprints, regardless of their importance, and regardless of whether they are new or old. This forms the first priority of secrecy, often making many engineering and technical personnel unable to see such materials with technical research and improvement value. Even if they can see a little, they are not allowed to take them out of the room and not allowed to copy, so they cannot remember them for a long time. Similarly, regarding the exchange of technical experience, it is also limited by secrecy and system, making some experiences that should have been exchanged canceled. Some, although they have been exchanged after a long time of contact, have already lost their effectiveness due to the passage of time. In order to accelerate the improvement of the level of engineering and technical personnel in our country and to accelerate the cultivation of new technical forces, in the future, except for a small number of truly important technical materials that must be strictly guarded to prevent leaks, other technical materials should not only be allowed to be read by engineering and technical personnel but also should be organized to read them in a planned way. At the same time, technical experience exchange meetings should be held regularly, professional seminars should be held, and planned visits should be organized, so that they can learn from each other, make up for each other's shortcomings, and continuously improve and improve work, to ensure the rapid advancement of our scientific and technological level.

Guo Keming's Speech

Chairman, fellow committee members, and comrades:

I am honored to be invited to attend this conference. We have listened to Premier Zhou's "political report" and the reports of other leaders and committee members, and I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support them.

Recently, socialist transformation is being carried out in various places across the country, especially the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is proceeding at a rapid pace. The people of the whole country are actively advancing towards socialism, and people's lives are gradually improving and becoming happier. However, in our joy, we must not forget the people of Taiwan who are suffering in deep water and fire. I fully support Premier Zhou's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan in his report and strive for the early liberation of the people of Taiwan to build a beautiful socialist society with us.

I am a medical worker, and we must firmly unite around the party, exert all our strength, and develop the medical and cultural heritage of our motherland to a new level, making greater contributions to the motherland and the people.

Here, I would like to share some of my thoughts and work situation with my comrades:

In our country, due to the semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature of old China, two types of medicine with different foundations developed simultaneously and competed for superiority. In terms of personnel, they could not unite, and in terms of academics, they could not exchange, thus creating a gap between traditional and Western medicine.

Since liberation, medical workers, under the wise and correct leadership of the party and the people's government, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government Health Department, have implemented the resolutions of the National Health Conference on the four principles of health work, and have carried out a series of instructions and measures. Uniting traditional and Western medicine to serve the people is a health work policy that Chairman Mao clearly pointed out decades ago, and it is an important policy of the party and the people's government. Firmly implementing the party's policy, actively giving play to the strength of traditional Chinese medicine, sorting out and improving our country's medical and cultural heritage, enriching modern medical science, and ensuring the health of the people is a very important and arduous task.

In the past four or five years, especially last year, after implementing the correct policy towards traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Chinese medicine associations, traditional Chinese medicine advanced study schools, traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, traditional Chinese medicine outpatient departments, traditional Chinese medicine joint clinics, traditional Chinese medicine research institutions, and large hospitals have paid attention to absorbing traditional Chinese medicine to participate in medical work. Medical colleges and schools have established traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine research organizations, held training classes, organized traditional and Western medicine to exchange experience, and so on. These undoubtedly are new phenomena in the people's health cause and will bring new strength to the people's health cause, and have already achieved initial results, which proves the correctness of the party's policy towards traditional Chinese medicine.

In 1954, I participated in the treatment work of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Hospital and achieved initial cooperation between traditional and Western medicine in the treatment of epidemic encephalitis B, achieving some results. The reason for the success is that after the correct policy towards traditional Chinese medicine, under the correct leadership of the party and Chairman Mao, traditional and Western medicine cooperated, and with leadership and organization, the collective strength was given full play to achieve it. Although I have more than 30 years of clinical experience, I was still unprepared and did not make greater contributions, which makes me feel ashamed. Due to my insufficient understanding of traditional and Western medicine, there may be mistakes in my views and treatment, and I hope you will not hesitate to point them out to correct my shortcomings.

The general situation of the treatment of epidemic encephalitis B in 1955

This year, in the treatment of epidemic encephalitis B, we still followed the general spirit of the treatment of epidemic encephalitis B in 1954: detoxification, clearing heat, and nourishing yin. In response to the government's call to practice economy and accumulate funds to build socialism, we racked our brains, and the expensive medicines such as musk and rhinoceros horn were used much less than last year. The cheap and effective stone gypsum was used much more than last year, but the treatment effect was not inferior to last year. Compared with last year's medicine, the savings this year are not small. If we calculate the average medicine cost for one patient, last year it was about 45 yuan for those who were discharged in about two weeks, and this year it was about 15 yuan for those who were discharged in about two weeks. Last year, the average medicine cost for those who were discharged in four or five days was about 4.5 yuan, and this year it was about 1.5 yuan for those who were discharged in four or five days. If the whole country treats it in this way in the future, then the savings can be imagined.

On December 19, 1955, we received the country's rewards and praise. We deeply feel the party and Chairman Mao's boundless care for us.

So, the glory today is due to the party and Chairman Mao's wise and correct leadership. This glory belongs to the party and belongs to our great leader Chairman Mao.

In the future, when we return to our work posts, we must exert all our strength to make greater contributions to the people's health cause, support the socialist construction of the motherland, and strive for the early realization of socialism! Strive for the early liberation of the people of Taiwan!

Finally, I wish all the leaders and committee members good health.

Wang Dafu's Speech

Chairman, fellow committee members, and comrades:

I fully support Premier Zhou's political report and the reports of the vice-chairmen of the Political Consultative Conference and Comrade Chen Boda. Especially after reading Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals at the meeting convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, I felt that the party and the government's care for intellectuals is meticulous and thorough, making me deeply moved and inspired. I deeply feel that intellectuals living in the Mao Zedong era are valued by the government and are happy. At the same time, I also feel that in the large-scale and rapid development of socialist construction, the task of intellectuals is also very arduous and glorious. The implementation of this policy will definitely be able to mobilize and give full play to the strength of intellectuals.

Due to the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the production of cotton and grain has increased dramatically, and the task of building state-owned textile factories in my Hebei province this year has increased by about eight times compared to 1955. Therefore, I feel that the responsibility on the shoulders of textile engineering and technical personnel is more arduous and glorious. Looking at the technical level of our textile factories, there are generally phenomena of low product quality, few varieties, outdated equipment, and low labor productivity, which are far behind the advanced level of the Soviet Union. Premier Zhou's call to intellectuals to give full play to their strength, continuously improve their political consciousness and professional level, and train a large number of new forces to expand the team to meet the growing needs of the country is absolutely correct and timely. Vice Chairman Guo Moruo also pointed out clear directions of effort in this regard in his report. I have the following suggestions and opinions on these issues, and I would like to request the government and relevant departments to consider them:

First, to give full play to the strength of engineering and technical personnel, in addition to solving some unreasonable phenomena in the aspects of use and treatment, I think that in textile enterprises, the main thing is to solve the problem of lack of unity between new and old technical cadres and among technical cadres of the same generation. Young cadres generally get close to the organization, have higher political consciousness, accept new things and learn advanced experience faster, but lack practical production experience, and consider problems not carefully and comprehensively. Older technical cadres are exactly the opposite, so the phenomenon of mutual disdain and lack of unity arises. Appropriate solutions should be found for these situations to achieve the effect of collective wisdom.

Second, regarding the large-scale training of new forces to expand the team of engineering and technical personnel, I think that in the enterprise department, the main thing is to do a good job of in-service training and improvement of various levels of cadres:

1. For the training and improvement of various levels of cadres, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Textile Management Bureau, and the textile factory should draw up a clear division of labor and responsibility plan, and implement it in detail. Each level should be responsible for the tasks to be trained.

2. The bureau and the factory should set up part-time technical improvement classes or part-time technical schools to improve the technical level of junior and intermediate technical personnel to senior intermediate technical level, and senior intermediate technical personnel to university or college level engineering and technical personnel in a certain period of time. Promotion and appointment work should also be done in a timely manner to gradually expand the team of senior engineering and technical personnel.

3. Strengthen the guidance and work assessment of university and college graduates. The chief engineer of the enterprise should take the lead in this work. Relying solely on the functions of the personnel department or technical education department is not enough to do this work well and achieve the expected results.

4. Senior technical personnel must often patiently and specifically guide and educate intermediate and junior technical cadres on the solution of specific technical problems in production, which is also an important link in the work of training new technical forces.

Third, regarding the improvement of the professional level of engineering and technical personnel, in addition to strengthening their study of Marxism-Leninism, my opinion is to do a good job in the following aspects:

1. Seriously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts in earnest.

The Ministry of Textile Industry has more than a dozen Soviet experts, each with their own expertise. If possible, they should be invited to regularly conduct professional inspections in various textile centers, point out the main problems existing in each factory, and make suggestions. The relevant enterprises should organize discussions and study the suggestions made by the experts, and formulate experimental and implementation plans to implement them earnestly.

2. The Ministry should regularly organize national textile technical professional conferences, similar to the one held in Qingdao in 1954, to exchange mature and advanced experience in various regions, so that each textile factory can learn from each other and improve the technical level together.

3. The leadership of the bureau and the factory should reasonably arrange the work of engineering and technical personnel, and must reduce their bureaucratism as much as possible to ensure that they have sufficient time to go deep into the workshops and engage in professional activities.

4. Support their business study and technical discussion for a few hours each week during production time, and ensure that these few hours are not occupied by other meetings. (Although there are regulations now, the time is not guaranteed.)

5. The spare time should also be reasonably arranged, and not all the activities of the party, the league, and the trade union should be occupied. At least two nights (each week) should be left for them to engage in scientific research self-study or collective research activities in their spare time. Only in this way can their sensory knowledge and theoretical level be improved simultaneously.

6. The Ministry of Textile Industry should instruct each textile management bureau to also start preparing to establish regional scientific research institutions related to the textile industry, allocate the necessary funds for the purchase of instruments, and configure the corresponding research personnel, so that they can carry out research work under the guidance of the Central Textile Research Institute to improve production technology. This is also an important problem to be solved in the work of advancing towards science and technology.

I am an old technical personnel who is nearly 60 years old and has been engaged in textile technology work for more than 30 years. In the old society, I was seriously infected with bourgeois ideology and style. After liberation, in the past six years, under the cultivation and education of the party, I participated in political study and several grand social reforms and ideological remolding movements, and I have basically overcome the past "earning money to eat" single technical viewpoint, and initially established the idea of doing my best to serve the people, but there are still remnants of backward, conservative, free, and easy, and individualistic old ideas. Attending this conference has given me a profound education, and I promise that in the future, under the leadership of the party, I will study Marxism-Leninism theory, strengthen self-education, and seriously carry out self-reform, do a good job of uniting old and new technical personnel and leaders of the bureau and the factory, actively study and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to continuously improve my political consciousness and professional level, and resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Guo Moruo to "require myself with the standard of a Communist Party member," learn their unlimited loyalty to the party, wholeheartedly serve the people's noble qualities, and their effective and specific leadership style of Bolsheviks, and often use the method of "three reflections and three questions" to urge myself. To strive for achievements in production that are more, faster, better, and more economical, and to make my greatest possible contribution to the work of catching up with the world's advanced level of the textile industry in our country within 12 years, so that I can gradually grow into an intellectual who wholeheartedly serves socialism!

    在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上的发言
    陈嘉庚的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志！
    我衷心拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，并完全同意李济深、郭沫若、陈叔通、董必武四位副主席和陈伯达委员的各项报告。
    周恩来主席在报告中指出：“我们的国家将有可能在一个不很长的时间内，以一个完全现代化的、有高度文化的、富强的社会主义工业大国出现于世界。”这句话给全国人民带来了莫大振奋，也将鼓舞1，200万国外华侨更加团结、更加热爱伟大的祖国。
    我在去年8月至11月间访问了东北、华北、西北、新疆维吾尔自治区、西南和中南等16省、30余名城，所见除福州、伊犁和昆明仍是古香古色外，其他城市都已经是：工厂栉比、街道宽直、高楼大厦耸立、交通畅达、清洁美丽，大大改变了往昔的面貌。工农业生产更是突飞猛进，文化教育和卫生事业亦有相应的发展。人民生活普遍提高。这一切标志着我国社会主义建设的辉煌成就，证明：社会主义使祖国富强、人民幸福，社会主义是适合中国国情的。
    最近中共中央提出的全国农业发展纲要，为全国人民特别是五万万农民提出一个幸福的远景，大家都为这个远景欢欣鼓舞。这个纲要同时也指出：任务是艰巨的，需要加倍努力，需要培植人才。毛主席说：“决定一切的是要有干部，要有数量足够的优秀的科学技术专家。”这句话很对很对。这里我就培养航海、水产和会计人才方面说几句。几年来我们对航海、水产和财经学校，未见增加，反有减少。现在农业合作化飞快发展，迫切需要会计人才。至航海、水产方面，以我国领海之广，海岸之长，鱼场之多，需要足够人才来发展海洋事业。因此我希望有关部门对培养此项技术人才加以注意。
    在这次大会上另一件使人兴奋的是开幕那天，我们看到来自各地的工人、农民、手工业者和工商业家们组成的报喜队，带着全国各地社会主义建设和社会主义改造伟大胜利的喜信，来向毛主席报喜。这确是一件震动世界的大喜事！在不到十天内，北京、上海、天津、沈阳、武汉、重庆、西安和广州等大城市的资本主义工商业全部公私合营了，资本家们和他们的家属都表示：“听毛主席的话，走社会主义的路”，欢欣鼓舞地参加了庆祝社会主义改造胜利大会的队伍。这有力地告诉国外华侨：国内的资本家是同全国的工人、农民、手工业者一起这样高高兴兴地走进社会主义社会的。同时也生动地告诉世界上所有资本家们：中国的资本家们所走的道路是幸福愉快的道路，这条道路也就是他们应该走的光明大道。
    周恩来主席提出了和平解放台湾的号召，我相信，这个号召很快就会深入到台湾同胞的心坎。800万台湾人民之中有将近600万人是闽南人，他们说的话和我现在说的话一样，是厦门语系的话。他们有很多是当时追随民族英雄郑成功到台湾去的后代。他们在那里反抗过清朝统治。也抵抗过日本殖民统治者，他们还有不少人是在台湾有家，在闽南也有家的。几年来由于美帝国主义霸占台湾和蒋介石卖国集团的统治，使他们父子、兄弟之间未能团聚或互相往来，过着痛苦的生活。当他们听到周恩来主席对他们的关怀和号召，一定会感到无比的温暖和兴奋。祖国建设的成就是这样辉煌，家乡面貌的改变是这样巨大，福建铁路很快就要通车了，火车要一直开到厦门市，他们一定会非常振奋。这里我要告诉台湾国民党军政人员：福建人民对于你们勾结美帝国主义奴役台湾同胞的罪行是痛恨的，但是只要你们响应周主席的号召，幡然改悟，走和平解放台湾的道路，使台湾回到祖国怀抱，福建人民也将和全国人民一样：宽大对待你们，不究既往。
    罗隆基的发言主席、诸位委员、诸位先生：
    我完全赞成周恩来主席、董必武、郭沫若、李济深、陈叔通几位副主席和陈伯达委员向大会分别做的几项报告。
    我们这次大会听了周恩来主席的政治报告后，知道党和政府正在拟订各项计划，加强领导，克服缺点，用一系列的具体有效的措施，来充分动员和发挥国家现有知识分子的潜在力量；并且正在制订全面规划，大量培养知识分子的新生力量，以适应国家社会主义事业迅速发展的需要。这不止使我们参加这次大会的人十分兴奋，这对全国的知识分子是一个极大的鼓舞。党和毛主席对国家现有的知识分子这样地深切关怀，这样耐心地培养和教育，我们表示衷心地感谢！
    解放后六年来，中国极大多数的知识分子是有显著的进步的，在工作上是有很大的成绩的。同时，知识分子在业务水平上，在政治觉悟上，还不能适应今天中国新时代急速发展的需要，这亦是一个事实。我坚决相信经过党和政府这一次的鼓励和号召，全国极大多数的知识分子必定会加培努力，继续进行自我教育、自我改造，进一步团结在共产党的周围，全心全意为社会主义服务。全国知识分子的大队伍，必定会严格遵守党和政府的号令，奋勇争先地向现代科学进军，争取在12年的时期，把我国最急需的科学部门提高到接近世界先进的水平。
    不过另一方面，由于中国封建制度和资产阶级的残余思想，更由于中国百年来半殖民地教育的毒害，有极少数的旧知识分子今天还存在着某些不健康的思想，因而妨碍着他们发挥积极的力量。这亦是不容否认的事实。我今天就愿从这样一个很小的角度上来说几句话。根据对知识分子情况视察中反映出来的材料，一般地说来，有极少数旧的高级知识分子，即以往从事政、法、财、经等社会科学工作的知识分子，6年来，在安排和使用上遇到了比较多的困难，因此，亦就有了比较多的苦闷。这种现象的造成，诚如周恩来主席所指出，“对于知识分子的使用和待遇还有某些不合理现象”。但我们亦必须承认，责任的一半是在知识分子本身。这少数的高级知识分子，年岁比较大，吸收中国旧社会的思想比较多，同时在欧美资本主义国家学来的一套社会科学，解放以后，自己发现全盘错误，于是自己感到彷徨失措，事事皆非。我也是一个旧知识分子，并且是一个从英美学社会科学的知识分子。对他们的心情，我是理解的。我今天就愿唤起这极少数的高级知识分子，我们不可以因为几年来在工作上遭遇过某些困难，就悲观失望。我们一定要认识到，在共产党和毛主席领导下的新中国，任何人只要不肯自甘淘汰，总是可以发挥有益的作用的，总是可以向人民作贡献的。同时，在新社会里，知识总找得到适当的用处的。怎样来妥当地使用自己的知识，主要地也靠知识分子自己的努力。几年来已经有了不少的例子，学社会科学的旧的高级知识分子经过思想改造，利用旧的知识作出了新的贡献。今天不是党对旧知识分子估计不够，而是极少数的旧知识分子对自己的前途估计不够；今天不是党对旧知识分子的信任不够，而是极少数旧知识分子对自己的前途信心不够。
    由于对自己的前途估计不够，有的人就赞赏李商隐的两句诗：“夕阳无限好，只是近黄昏”。有“黄昏思想”的人说：“国家前途，光芒万丈，个人前途，暗淡无光”。因此，全国人在歌唱东方红，他却在慨叹夕阳好，全国人是朝气勃勃，他却是暮气沉沉，实际上这只是他自己立场、观点的错误。天天只看见夕阳的人，换一个立场、观点，背西面东，而后向前看不向后看，他当然就天天看见东方红，太阳升了。一个人只要一切不专从自己个人利益来打算，把个人同群众的集体结合，把个人命运同国家前途结合，就自然兴奋，自然快乐了！
    由于对自己的前途信心不够，有人还发生了“不如归去”的想法，常常背诵陶渊明的“归去来兮”，来消愁解闷。旧的古典文学是可以读的，值得读的，今天我们旧时代的知识分子在陶渊明“归去来兮”这篇文章里应该熟读的是这样几句：“悟已往之不谏，知来者之可追；实迷途其未远，觉今是而昨非。”我们只要有了今是昨非的认识，努力学习，努力改造，就自然会看见新的光明，找到新的前途。
    现在还有一些高级知识分子存在着不同程度的作客思想。有极少数的高级知识分子，闲散在社会，或者有了岗位还没有被分配适当的工作，他们就坐守“闲得发慌”，却不肯主动地自告奋勇拿出本事来争取向国家向人民贡献。国家的宪法就鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性。任何人用自己的劳动力来争取工作总是光荣的。我们不要忘记今天是人民民主国家，人人是国家的主人翁，不是客卿。在这样的新国家里，有本事的人都应该学毛遂自荐，脱颖而出，不应该有诸葛亮的客卿思想，等待着“三顾茅芦”。国家今天工业、农业中几万几十万劳动模范，都是凭着自己的本事脱颖而出的英雄。任何人努力把自己所有的特殊专长尽量贡献给国家、给人民，他就可以做人民的模范，国家的英雄。
    我所批评的几种思想，是今天旧知识分子中极少数人的思想。有了毛主席“团结一切可能团结的力量”的指示，有了党和政府充分动员和发挥所有知识分子力量的号召，我相信，这少数的高级知识分子必定能够迅速地得到合理的和适当的安排。我更坚决相信，这极少数的人今天必定受到了极大的感动和鼓励，必定会欢欣鼓舞地来接受新的任务，更必定会全心全意地来为社会主义服务。
    今天中国的工人、农民，知识分子已经结成了亲密的联盟。这是中国现有的知识分子十分光荣的地位。工人、农民、知识分子三者的精神的和政治的一致，是社会主义社会最重要的一种动力。为着向毛主席保证完成社会主义革命这个光荣的任务，我们就要巩固这个联盟，加强这个动力。中国现有的知识分子必须坚决地和工人、农民联在一起，在友爱合作的基础上共同生活、共同工作、共同前进，使祖国能够顺利地并且胜利地完成已经成熟了的历史任务。
    王葆真的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意周总理的政治报告和李副主席、郭副主席、陈副主席、董副主席和陈伯达委员各位的报告，并表示衷心拥护。
    在保卫世界和平运动伟大胜利和我国国际间的威信光芒万丈的今天，在国内社会主义的高潮欢天喜地的今天，在看到了40条农业发展纲要的今天，又听到了周总理具有国际重要意义的政治报告。我兴奋愉快的心情，为今生几十年来所未有。为了和平解放台湾，周总理宣布五项指示，这对有反动和卖国罪恶的是至极伟大的宽恕。台湾一切军政人员应立即幡然悔悟，为争取早日归来祖国而奋斗；台湾800万同胞，应即闻风兴起，为争取获得和平解放而斗争。
    从学习自我改造思想来说：除了认真地学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作而外，我觉得更需要从实践的体会中，改造自己的思想。我在这次视察工作中，看到好多值得学习的榜样：
    一、学习贫农、下中农团结、互助、友爱的精神，改造自私自利的个人主义以树立集体主义的思想。清苑县张存农业社在1954年夏秋大水灾，三户中农退社后，社长张存是贫农，副社长陈荣是下中农，同社员们更加团结。特别是设法救济了七户贫苦社员的家庭生活，克服了困难，度过了灾荒。到1955年秋，就由13户的小社扩大为101户的大社。张存社长说：“办好社以社员团结占第一位，贫农、下中农是容易做好团结的”。像这样的例子很多，他们社里没有个人主义和宗派思想的斗争，只有团结、互助和友爱。社里妇女和社外结了婚，还不愿离开她的社。
    二、学习农业社负责干部的虚心学习，虚心地接纳意见，改造自高自大和骄傲自满及不肯接受批评的作风。当我们走到饶阳县耿尚口乡、深县段家庄、藁城毛庄各个社，及看到邢台东川口社长时，各社负责人说：由于听到了耿长锁介绍办社的经验和带动之下，他们才把社建立起来，并说明社中的缺点。我们同去视察的代表，有的批评他们的猪圈不卫生、水利工作不够好、妇女工作有的差，以及提了不少意见。他们都欢然接纳并致感谢。其实他们社里优点很多，可是他们还虚心地、诚恳地接纳批评和意见。这一点就值得知识分子虚心地学习。首先从我学起。
    三、学习听从领导、俭苦、勤劳的精神，克服松懈、怠惰、浪费等资产阶级的思想意识。清苑王连三利民社，人称它为贫农社。社无牲口套，用破布条、破衣裳拧作套绳；没钱买肥料，辛苦积肥；无农具、社员借耠子。他人说：这股穷棒子弄不好。王连三说：咱们穷，听毛主席的话，我们就会好起来，毛主席说过，贫农也能组织起来。1955年秋，社里增产40％。村人争着加入他的社，说：“王连三社勤苦劳动，又很节俭，加入这社很放心”。武安县伯延乡建设社1955年抗旱挖沟，女子万增荣担土一挑70斤，整日工作。人问她肩膊疼否？她说：“等习惯了就不疼了”。藁城毛庄社70岁小脚女人李香荣，为了抗旱点种，推水车竞赛，当选为劳动模范。有的社秋收时，为了响应上级号召“精收细打、颗粒还家”，禾穗被风雨打掉了米粒，妇女在田间扫出粮食两万多斤，做到地里清、场里净。我看到农民们自清早至夜晚的辛勤劳作，感想到城市中的生活物资、吃穿日用，都是劳动人民辛辛苦苦生产出来的。如果不劳动，自己多一分的享受，就等于对劳动人民多一分的剥削，是不合乎社会主义按劳取酬的道理，是应该提高警惕，把自己一切资产阶级的思想意识完全加以清洗改造的。
    四、学习坚定地站在劳动阶级立场，克服自由主义和右倾的保守思想。耿长锁社自1943年成立互助组后，经过敌人骚扰和企图混入的困难，均经克服。1951年社务发展，富农要求参加，亦拒绝不收。但有社员产生了资产阶级的思想，想向富农方向发展，并搞商业。经过社里进行批判，方能保住站稳阶级立场而不被拉垮。又有许多贫农、下中农的社，均是在党的领导下，站在坚定的阶级立场，不为一切外力所动摇；也不向一切困难低头，而战胜了一切困难；并能很快地接受新鲜事物，学习苏联先进经验和农业技术，逐步地获得了增产、丰产的成绩。
    五、学习从实践中劳动创造的精神，克服只说空话，对人民不负责任的官僚主义。深县甄春双社长不识字，但是他报告社的各项生产数字和一切情况，很明确详细。他画了一张图表，作为自己的记号。他在村东南修了一道防风墙，保住了几千亩田的丰收。晋县曹同义社创造科学记工的办法，包工包产，分12类至16类，13级，230项。满城红旗社的妇女在秋凉以后，脚泡在寒水中挖沟，带动社员群众开成了沟渠，战胜了水灾。武安建设社开掘三亩七分大、二丈深的一个池塘，蓄水抗旱，点种一万亩棉花。宁河县皂甸乡创造了台田，收到洗硷防潦的效用。邢台元兴社播种松子，绿化了荒山。南宫县王道砦社创造了耙、压盖联合保墒器。威县先锋社创造了风打磨。伯延乡社创造了喷粉器。邢台军营社，亩产小麦802斤。灵寿县刘英起社亩产白马牙玉米一千多斤。临城县贺书箱社，亩产甘薯16，000斤。这些成绩都是由于贫苦的人民，在获得解放以后，在各级党委指导帮助下，从辛勤地劳动实践中创造出来的，而不是仅仅说几句时代语言或对人民不负责任的官僚主义所能做到的。我觉得我应该向着这些劳动人民的实践来学习，学习他们忘我无私地、无限忠诚地贡献出自己的力量。
    我以上这些话可能有多少错误，希望各位同志予以批评和指正。
    最后，我很感谢周总理和郭副主席给我们指出了进入社会主义社会的光明道路，就是全心全意为人民服务，和工人、农民联盟的方向以及学习自我改造的方法。这是人生最难得的无比宝贵的启示。倘如我不这样做，在工农联盟中似乎不需要添进一个腐朽无用的知识分子，那就落后于时代了。我不愿意自己和任何人落在社会主义社会以外，希望都能从学习赶上前进。我完全不需要考虑自己的年纪，但考虑怎样贡献自己的力量。我愿意活一天，就能尽到一天的责任，我的热情沸腾着，似青年一样的燃烧；我愿意和工人、农民一道，为社会主义的建设而努力；愿意和大家一起载歌载舞，共同庆祝完成社会主义建设的胜利；愿意和全国劳动人民共同歌颂共产党！毛主席！
    孙淑芝的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心地、热烈地拥护周恩来主席的政治报告以及其他首长们的各项报告。
    我是一个一般的知识分子，我从事小学教育工作。解放以来，我也切身体验到党和政府一向是重视和关怀一般知识分子的。党和政府为了提高小学教师的政治、业务和文化水平，除了在每周的一定时间内组织我们学习之外，还利用寒暑假组织过多次政治和业务训练班，许多城市设立了教师业余进修学校。哈尔滨的小学教师获得了相当于中师程度的教师业余进修学校毕业证书的，已大有人在。解放到现在，我已经参加了八次训练班的学习。党和政府还组织我们参加土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”等历次伟大的社会运动，培养锻炼我们工人阶级的立场、思想和观点。1955年10月间，我还随着我国赴苏代表团到苏联学习先进的教学经验。这一切说明了党和政府对知识分子是一贯重视，一贯是无微不至地关怀。在周恩来主席和郭沫若副主席的报告中，要我们和工人农民大联盟，发挥我们的力量和积极性，为社会主义建设而努力。这又是知识分子多么兴奋的事啊！
    不同类型的知识分子在社会主义建设中所分担的任务，是艰巨而光荣的。郭副主席告诉我们教育工作者：“从事教育工作的人，应该提高教学质量，为祖国培养出大批知识分子，使知识分子的队伍从几百万人迅速发展到上千万人。”看起来，这好像是从事高等教育和技术教育的高级知识分子的事。其实对小学教育也是十分有关系的。大鸡是从小鸡长大的，高级知识分子是从小学生培养起来的，小学生是高级知识分子的后备军。如果小学不提高教育质量，不培养出好的小学生，受大学教育和技术教育的高等和中等的知识分子从何而来呢？因此，从事小学教育工作的人，也得首先为提高小学教育的质量，为培养知识分子后备军而努力。下面我谈一下有关提高小学教育质量方面的几点不成熟的建议：
    一、提高师资水平是提高教育质量的关键。目前小学教育质量不高的主要原因是师资水平还远远落在形势发展的后面。随着农业的发展，在“全国农业发展纲要
  （草案）”第二九条中，规定了按照各地情况，在7年或者12年内，普及小学义务教育的指示，这就是说，从现在起就要着手进行小学普及义务教育了。要实现小学普及义务教育，就要培养大批小学师资，增设学校，扩大小学教师队伍。在这种情形下，要提高小学教育质量，我觉得可以一面组织短期训练班，使现有教师轮流参加学习，提高工作能力；另方面要重视师范教育，纠正过去把投考其他学校而落取了的学生收容到师范学校中去的偏向。要保证师范学校学生的质量，保证把合格的师范毕业生分配到小学校中去工作。至于这些新参加工作的师范学生缺乏教学经验的问题，也可以鼓励那些比较有经验的老教师采取负责带徒弟的办法，使新教师在教学实践中及时吸取老教师的教学经验。这样做不仅能够逐渐地提高所有小学教师的政治、文化业务水平，也会逐渐地提高教育质量。
    二、鼓励教师们积极发挥、贡献出自己的潜在力量来。现在各小学的教师，大多数是要求进步、积极工作的。其中也有些教师的文化水平、政治觉悟比较高，教学经验也比较丰富而且工作积极努力的。对这些人，是教师的榜样，他们的教学经验，可以供给多数教师学习、参考。各地方这几年已经在陆续发现并奖励优秀教师了。可是有些地方还在怕选拔奖励的教师不够优秀，或者怕被选拔和奖励的教师不能长期保证他们的优秀而不敢动手。这样会影响小学教师的积极性，也会因此而妨碍了教育质量的提高，我希望各级教育行政部门积极地选拔奖励优秀教师，从而鼓励所有教师，使大家发挥积极性，贡献更大的力量来为提高教育质量而努力。
    三、经常检查学校工作，帮助教师总结经验，也是非常必要的。教育行政部门到学校检查工作，既可以推动鼓励教师们的工作热情，也便于及时了解情况给与具体帮助；对于那些有经验而不会总结的教师，也可以发现他们的经验，帮助他们总结，使全国范围内广大的小学教师，得以及时的学习他们的经验，而共同提高教育质量。
    此外，党和政府对小学教师的待遇和福利也是一向关怀的，几年来就在不断的提高和改进中。但目前在教师中间，有的因为家庭人口多，劳动力少，有吃少穿的情况也还存在着。乡村中的教师比城市教师工资低，他们的困难就更多。有幼儿的女教师，由于她们的子女不能进入托儿所和幼儿园，就得一面工作，一面照顾自己的子女。这些情况不能说对他们的工作没有影响。为了使所有小学教师集中精力搞好工作，提高教育质量，我希望有关方面在可能的条件下，适当地予以照顾，予以解决。
    以上是对教育行政和财务部门的希望。我们小学教师本身，应该认识到自己各方面的水平还很差，在思想上工作上都存在不少缺点，今后除了不断地进行思想改造，努力学习马克思列宁主义理论，更需要深入的学习苏联先进教学经验和苏联教师高度的社会主义劳动态度，我这次到苏联去参观，看到他们的小学没有一个办得不好的。教师们几乎个个都是教育专家，他们不但精通教育理论，也都掌握熟练的教学技能，教育的质量自然是提得很高了。我们如果能钻研他们的教学经验，学习他们那种社会主义的劳动态度，再发挥自己的创造性，我们也就不难于提高我们的教学质量了。
    我相信，我们全体小学教师，在新的形势面前一定会努力提高自己的文化、政治、业务水平和社会主义觉悟，决不会甘心落在新形势的后面的。我愿意和我国全体小学教师一道，不断地进行学习、团结、改造，用社会主义的劳动态度，为国家培养全面发展的小学生，为培养大批知识分子后备军而贡献出一切力量。
    荣科的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周总理的政治报告及郭沫若院长的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告。我以十二万分的热情，迎接党付与知识分子的使命，并且满怀信心的相信在党的正确领导下一定能够在十二年内赶上世界的先进科学水平。没有疑问的，这是摆在知识分子面前非常艰巨的工作，但是我认为只要我们知识分子能够正确地认识这个使命的重大意义，紧密地团结在党的周围，在党的正确领导下，我们一定能完成这个光荣的任务。
    首先，我们知识分子应该认识工人阶级的创造性，在复杂高深的科学研究工作中，应该密切地与工人配合着发挥集体的力量。这样就不会脱离实际，而能够把研究的成果用于建设社会主义的生产。解放以后，在工业战线上、农业战线上，由于知识分子能与工人配合在技术上有重大贡献的，事实是太多了。
    第二，要衷心地学习苏联先进经验，并且运用苏联先进经验到生产技术中去。因为苏联成就的科学果实是许许多多科学家们的集体结晶，而且是在他们社会主义建设生产过程中经过了考验的，是正确的。因此我们必须端正态度，学习运用。我们切不可因为自己是科学家，学习运用苏联的先进经验，就会贬低了自己在科学界上的地位；更不要强调困难，说什么条件不同，设备不同，而就不可能在中国运用苏联先进经验。这些由于个人出发而不考虑整体社会主义建设的事业，都会削弱我们的力量。
    我是一个机械制造热作技术人员，由于在解放后，深切地认识苏联先进经验的先进与完整性，又因为紧密地依靠党，在工作中与工人密切结合，不独在简陋的设备上运用苏联先进经验，解决了最复杂的生产问题，而且也普遍地提高了工人与自己的技术水平。我感到我以前的技术是零零落落的，而现在经过学习苏联先进经验，使我感到我是有了一套从头到尾的完整系统的技术经验。假使没有党的培养，我就没有今天的成就。我以后更要加紧学习，靠近党的。
    苏联先进经验的优越性，拿个事实例子来说。在铝钓合金的变质处理作业中，英美只告诉我们用纯钠处理。而苏联则告诉我们用钠盐处理，这不但延长了合金的有效时间，还保证了镁的稳定性，使铸件满足机械性能的要求。在用英美经验时，由于延伸率不合格，为什么报废，我们始终找不出原因，抱怨工人不会操作。而苏联先进经验告诉我们，由于钠的迅速挥发，增进了镁的挥发，这才在学习苏联经验中找到了答案。
    第三要依靠党，我们知识分子，大部都有清高自赏，合则留，不合则去的思想，因而稍有不适意，则有拂袖而去另觅馆地的想法。这事实上是错误的。党对知识分子是爱护的，只是由于我们不靠拢党，把党分成你我，划成一条界限，仍然用旧的思想对待革命工作，没有把党的命运与自己联系在一起，更没有看清党是为人民做什么工作的，也没有树立献身于祖国的革命人生观，把自己束缚在个人得失的小天井中，因而同党闹对立。这虽然不是多数，但也为数不少的。这样与党的距离越来越远，越感到党不信任我，自己一无所为了。事实上是自己在闹。听取了周总理报告后，我们应该知道党对我们是热爱的，是照顾的，而且无微不至的。今后我们必须依靠党，在党的正确的领导下，贡献出我们的全部力量，完成党对我们期望的工作。
    最后，我愿意表达我两个心愿：
    第一、在周总理报告中，说明对知识分子若干使用和待遇还存在一些问题。在我个人的体会中，我觉得在生活待遇中若与解放前相比，真是天地相隔了。解放前，我在反动政府贵州大学教书，每月的薪水领来的金元券还须到银元贩子处去换光洋，每月不过一两元，生活不能维持，卖衣典当，到最后我和我的爱人及四岁的女孩被迫自己开荒田种菜吃。解放以后，我生活得非常优裕。所以在待遇方面认为党对我们是仁至义尽了，何况国家在建设社会主义，处处须要用钱，所以不应该把我们的生活抬的太高了。
    但是毕竟我们还要提高待遇的。我要求党考虑适当地提高知识分子的政治待遇，使我们在思想上能够更接近党，这样才会更发挥团结的力量。
    第二、我的大孩子最近已报名服兵役，身体检验也合格了。他说，他以满怀热爱祖国的心愿去服兵役，争取将来作一个党的忠勇战士，并且鼓励我把全部知识力量贡献于祖国的社会主义建设，永远保持山西省特等劳动模范的光荣称号。我想，我有信心，改造自己，保证实现这个愿望。
    凌其翰的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心拥护周恩来主席的政治报告。我想就周主席报告中关于解放台湾问题的部分，对台湾国民党外交人员说几句话。
    当祖国各界各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，欢欣鼓舞地进行着我们祖先从未做过的空前伟大的事业——社会主义建设的时候，我不由得不怀念逃往台湾和留在海外的国民党外交人员。他们中间绝大多数都是我的旧朋友。我敢肯定说，他们绝大多数都不是甘心卖国的，也不是完全没有爱国心的，因此，我要向他们进言忠告。
    台湾国民党外交人员大致可以分成三类：一类是在台湾的人，一类是在台湾以外的人，还有一类是已经被国民党裁撤而仍流亡在海外的人。在台湾的人绝大多数都不是死硬的反动分子，他们都在那里感到无比的苦闷、怅惘和失望。他们心中有数，摆在他们面前的只是一幅凄惨不堪的前景。他们决不对蒋介石集团存着丝毫幻想，他们只想替个人和家庭打算。那末，他们作什么打算呢？他们无论职位高低，没有一个不是在日日夜夜盼望调到外国去充当伪外交官，借此逃出台湾的樊笼。这是他们一致的、唯一的“最高理想”然而蒋介石集团虽在美国支持下在国外还设立着若干伪使领馆，由于在国际间的活动范围，正如法国19世纪现实主义文学家巴尔扎克的小说“驴皮”一样，一天比一天缩小，从而他们之中能够逃出台湾的樊笼，实现他们的“最高理想”的人简直是凤毛麟角，很不多见。因此，他们绝大多数人只好抱着听天由命的心情，被关在樊笼中度日如年，在那里暗暗叫苦，这是可以肯定的。
    在台湾以外的国民党外交人员怎样呢？他们既然逃出台湾的樊笼，就应该额手相庆了吧！这倒也未必。他们大致有三怕：一怕经费不来，使他们在海外无以为生；二怕紧缩裁员，使他们进退两难；三怕驻在国政府改变政策，与中华人民共和国谈判建交，因而不得不封闭伪使馆，到那时，既不敢再投入台湾这火坑，那就只有流落海外，沦为“白华”。这三怕倒是必然注定的结果，但是他们光怕有什么用呢？
    至于已被国民党裁撤而仍流亡在海外的人，那些人的心情又是怎样呢？自从祖国全面解放以来，台湾国民党所谓“外交部”早已一再撤馆裁员，欠薪减薪。老实说，那些被裁的人，或是辞职的人，对台湾国民党是有怨恨的，一般都不敢前往台湾，自投罗网。他们绝大多数人或是流落海外，沦为“白华”；或是寄居香港，只靠过去留下的若干积蓄，现在都已用到“坐吃山空”的边缘，正开始度着等于“无国籍人”的流浪生活。他们的心情是够悲哀的。他们的生活是够凄惨的。他们的想法也是够愚蠢的。他们受了帝国主义宣传造谣的蛊毒，反动派特务的威胁，以致他们不敢相信作为今天伟大祖国的公民真会有这样的自由和幸福。尽管他们有时不免要怀念故乡，怀念在故乡的亲人，但是他们抱着种种顾虑，他们都不敢想像返回祖国真会得到祖国人民的宽待。
    台湾和在台湾以外的国民党外交人员，以及已被国民党裁撤而仍流亡在海外的旧外交人员，他们的一般思想情况大概如此。顺便指出，除了这三类人员以外，还有在各种国际组织里的中国籍职员，他们虽然不是台湾国民党直接任命的外交人员，却和台湾国民党保持间接的关系。他们持有“国际职员”的身份，对祖国仍旧保持着观望的态度。有的还受到不平等的待遇而忍气吞声。他们的地位是不稳定的。他们的心情也是苦闷的。因此我在这里说的话，对于他们也是一样有效。
    他们有没有出路呢？我说：他们的出路已经由周恩来主席在报告中明白指出来了。周恩来主席在报告中说：“现在，跑到台湾的国民党军政人员中，愿意通过和平途径回到祖国大陆上的人一定是不少的。他们都有家族或者亲友住在大陆，许多人想回到大陆来同自己家族或者亲友团聚。我们号召一切跑到台湾和海外的国民党军政人员，莫再迟疑，早日走和平解放台湾的道路！因此，我代表中国人民和中国政府在这里宣布：凡是愿意回到大陆省亲会友的，都可以回到大陆上来。凡是愿意到大陆来参观和学习的，也都可以到大陆上来。凡是愿意走和平解放台湾道路的，不管任何人，也不管他们过去犯过多大罪过，中国人民都将宽大对待，不究既往。凡是在和平解放台湾这个行动中立了功的，中国人民都将按照立功大小给以应得的奖励。凡是通过和平途径投向祖国的，中国人民都将在工作上给以适当的安置”、
    必须指出：“一切跑到台湾和海外的国民党军政人员”当然也包括国民党在台湾和海外的一切外交人员在内。我希望他们能够仔细地、反复地读这一段话。我想，他们之中如果有人读到这段话，不会不无动于衷的。很明显，这一段话就是向他们指明的出路。事实最雄辩，在全国解放初期，中国共产党和人民政府对于旧人员只要没有显著反动的行为，一概采取“包下来”的政策。这几年来，旧人员绝大多数都已转变为人民政府的好干部。就拿旧外交人员来说吧，我的许多旧朋友回国以后，党和政府都对他们本着“量才录用”的方针，作出妥当的安排，在各方面给予适当的工作岗位。他们之中有的人正在发挥他们的专长，得到政府的器重。就拿我自己来说吧！我担任国民党外交工作整整达16年，自从1949年10月和其他几位朋友一起在巴黎宣布了脱离国民党关系以后，1950年5月回国以来，党和政府给我的温暖、信任和器重实在不是笔墨所能形容的。
    周恩来主席在报告中已经向他们指出了这条光明的出路，他们还有什么迟疑不决呢？还有什么值得顾虑呢？中国人民一定要解放台湾，台湾一定会得到解放。在台湾和海外的国民党外交人员以及已被国民党裁撤而仍流亡在海外的人们，他们想回到大陆与家人团聚呢？还是甘心坚持走他们现在走着的绝路呢？西方有句俗语，“条条道路通罗马”他们可以根据自己不同的具体情况，作出相应的措施。他们可以公开响应周主席的号召，站在爱国主义的旗帜下，进行争取和平解放台湾的斗争。他们可以静悄悄地“通过和平途径投向祖国。”他们也可以对祖国采取保留态度，回国观光。然而容许他们作出抉择的时间已经不多了，莫再迟疑了，这是最后的机会。让他们清醒一下头脑，作出果断的决定吧！
    刘瑶章的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周总理的政治报告。
    周总理的报告说：“我国政府一年来曾经再三指出：除了用战争方式解放台湾以外，还存在着用和平方式解放台湾的可能性。”并号召：“台湾同胞和一切从大陆上跑到台湾的人员，站到爱国主义旗帜下来，同祖国人民一起，为争取和平解放台湾、实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗吧！”当我听到这里，我立刻想到了台湾和跑到台湾的国民党军政人员，同时又回想到和平解放前后的北京和那时正在北京担任国民党市长的我自己。
    远在北京和平解放之前，北京的周围都已先后解放，北京城死气沉沉，不但市面萧条而混乱，市民的穷困也达于极点。在这种情况下，北京的和平解放不能不形成各方面一致的迫切要求。实际上北京的和平解放，也确实做到：使得200万人民的生命财产未受损失，几百年来的历史文物未遭破坏，使得原来国民党的军政人员，包括我在内，都得到宽大的待遇。
    在当时，和平解放的好处，摆在眼前，尽人皆知，我所最担心的还是我个人的前途。因为，在北京解放之前，我和共产党毫无联系，不，并且把共产党做为政治斗争的对象，因此，对共产党就不可能有正确的了解。特别在和平解放谈判的前后，我的思想情绪很复杂，并有很大的波动——对国民党觉得可惜，对蒋介石满怀怨愤，对共产党是恐惧和疑虑交织着。我担心战争，又惟恐停不下来；我愿意和平，又怕中途变化；我曾经想离开北京，又想不出那里是安身立命之地。但是，侥天之幸，我终于留下来了。
    刚刚解放不久，虽然和共产党接触不多，但是耳闻目见，我的恐惧和疑虑已经消除了大半。不久我被分配到水利部担任办公厅主任，这说明共产党对我的信任。几年来，我在工作中经常受到共产党的教育和各方面的帮助。最近去河北视察，更看见了新中国农业合作化的高潮和农民生活日益改善的情况。7年来，我的身体比从前更坚强了，精神更健旺了，整个的生活内容比从前更新鲜、更丰富了。在和青年们一道工作和生活当中使我不知不觉地忘了我已经是60岁。其实，还不只我个人，就我所知道的，在北京解放前后没有离开的旧朋友们，凡是肯于诚心诚意为人民服务的，莫不有适当的工作，并过着较前美好的生活。
    从1949年2月解放军正式入城以后，我眼看着北京从破烂、穷困、污秽、混乱的基础上一天天地飞跃地在变化。不但各种的建设一日千里，使北京的市容焕然一新，就是北京的每一个市民的面貌，从他的愉快、紧张、活泼、热情的表情上来看，也是前后判若两人。新的工厂一个接一个地完成。数不尽的新的建筑物迅速改变了这个古老城市的面貌。不劳而食的闲人绝少看到。郊区农民在连年增产的情况下，愁眉苦脸再也碰不见了。由于一般人收入的逐年增加，人们的购买力都大大地提高。各个中学的学生一般地都发展到以千计，大学和专门学院更是增加了好多好多。成群的乞丐、流氓以至盗窃犯都已转入了劳动生产。一个新型的社会秩序已建立起来。人和人的关系变得格外亲切、诚恳和和蔼。苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠就快要绝迹了。整个新的北京市，不只是全国人民政治、经济、文化活动的中心，也是我们国际朋友们所最喜爱的一个城市。这具体说明解放以后的政府才是真正为人民做事的政府，解放以后的人民，才真正过着幸福的生活。
    现在困处台湾孤岛的国民党军政人员，他们受美帝国主义的武力控制，陷台湾同胞于水深火热之中，具有争取自由和解放的革命传统的台湾同胞，是决不甘心过这种外力统治下的奴隶生活的。同时，当我们伟大祖国人民正在奔向社会主义的时候，不能不十分关怀台湾同胞的命运，因此，祖国人民一定要解放台湾，台湾是一定要解放的。如果台湾的军政人员还指望美帝国主义替他们“养生送死”，那么，正如周总理所说：“历史证明，侵略者必然失败，而投靠侵略者以图苟延残喘的人不是跟着失败，就是被人牺牲。”
    如果他们能够幡然觉悟，帮助和平解放台湾，不但解除了外国武力统治给台湾同胞所造成的灾难，使得台湾同胞今后能够和祖国人民一道前进。同时，对于和平起义的军政人员来说，他们使台湾归还祖国，就是对祖国立了功勋，对亚洲和世界的和平也作了贡献，这就是他们的光明出路。
    我在北京和平解放前的情况和今天台湾军政人员的情况是大体相似的，在北京解放前夕，我的思想情况，也可能和今天台湾的军政人员是大体相似的，但是北京解放以后的我和跑到台湾的军政人员的情况就根本不同了。问题很清楚，道路也很明白，台湾的军政人员还有什么迟疑观望的呢？他们可能说：晚了。不错，就是晚了。可是如果不争取在今天，明天、后天就更晚了。他们也可能这样想：周总理报告中关于宽大对待和适当安置的提示未必可靠吧？这种疑虑是可以理解的，但是北京解放以后，铁的事实——我亲自体验的事实，已经充分解答了这一问题。
    周总理说：“我们全体中国人民，包括大陆人民和台湾人民，应该在爱国主义旗帜下团结起来，共同努力来自己解决这个属于我国内部的事务。”这个号召是绝对正确也是绝对适时的。我希望台湾军政人员当机立断，急起直追，使得台湾早日归还祖国的怀抱，以实现中华人民共和国的完全统一。
    吴櫂仙的发言
    我是重庆一个学医10年，行医40年的中医。现党和人民政府指示中西医学术交流，这次出席中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次会议，全国各省市皆有中西医卫生人员出席。昨天听了一个护士同志说，一年内小儿麻疹死亡率在万数以上。又小儿乙型脑炎——中医名暑痫证，过去由各医院先抽脊髓，死亡率亦太大。
    试将这两种小儿病分别说明：一、小儿麻疹是在母腹中秉受来的胎毒，普通称为传染病，恐温度过高，往往用消炎药品以致麻疹不能出齐，或开窗通空气加受风寒，以致胎毒不能外出还返于内，多成不治之证。中医治小儿麻疹，在新出未齐点时先用发表药（加味升麻葛根汤），在未齐点时，发热虽重亦不能用退烧药。现点三天四天，手心足心都现齐了，才可以见证治证。如麻疹胸背虽见，手未过肘，足未过膝，最当小心照料，谨慎风寒。忌用太凉性药及重镇药收敛药，如有错误，往往造成回毒死亡之害。我治麻疹多年，麻子回毒救治有一经验方，用黑向日葵壳二个，煮好乘热熨之，用干手巾拭之，注重熨手足心寒凉处，如胸背皆回，则全体皆熨之，陆续熨，陆续拭干，谨慎风寒，如手足心出现则不虑矣。此救治小儿麻子回毒之特效方也。
    再说小儿暑痫证（一名急惊风一新名乙型脑炎），每年夏至节后，小儿多此病，乃暑热入心，上熏于脑，遂成搐搦掣颤反引窜视之证。过去医院先抽脊髓，往往造成脑炎死亡之害。中医用清心清胃之药，十全八九。如清营汤、紫雪丹，清心之正法也。肝气旺者用清热镇惊汤，脑炎重者用石膏清胃热，此中医治小儿暑痫之经验良方也。外有小儿吐泻之后，手足寒，搐搦不甚，目微上视或鼻准亦寒，此漫脾风也。当用温中补脾汤与急惊风成为反比例，慎不可用凉性药。如错用之，则随手杀人，医之罪也。1955年，我新任重庆第一中医院院长之职，暑天收小儿暑痫证13人，皆未抽脊髓，用清营汤等方治愈12人。一孩体过弱，月余住院中而死。外一○一厂送来两小孩病暑痫者，先经厂医抽脊髓，病增重，速乘火车送来我院已不能服药。先后两次，送来两个，皆晚间送来，天未明而死。院中同人嘱我不说“抽脊髓”三字，恐开罪新科学之医中同道，但恸见小儿之死亡者众，愿作一真正交流学术之中医，愿作新科学者之直友，谅我罪我，在所不计也。
    外有一针灸组发言稿，时间迫促，不可尽言。
          敬祝
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    姜永宁、黄亨的联合发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们能代表中国的运动员参加这样的大会，心里有说不出的高兴和感动。我们衷心地拥护周总理的“政治报告”和其他首长的报告。
    解放以前，我国的体育运动是非常落后的，在帝国主义和国民党的反动统治下，对体育事业不仅根本谈不到有什么建树，人民自发参加体育运动的积极性也被摧残殆尽。黄亨同志原来是个雇农，我原来是个小职员，我们虽然一直爱好体育运动，但由于生活困难，或者根本得不到参加体育运动的机会，或者不能经常参加锻炼，运动成绩很难提高。解放后，在毛主席“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的指示下，在党和人民政府的支持和关怀下，我国体育运动变成了人民的事业，为广大劳动人民服务，才和其他建设事业一样，蓬勃地发展起来，使我们成为人民的运动员，代表祖国参加国际比赛。我的乒乓球技术也在党和政府的关怀和支持下得到了提高，使我有可能在世界青年联欢节第二届国际青年运动会上获得了乒乓球男子单打第二名，为祖国争取了荣誉。
    目前我国的社会主义工业化和农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造正在高速度地向前迈进。而以美国为首的帝国主义集团在不断地叫喊战争，制造国际紧张局势。美帝国主义者还以武力侵占了我国领土台湾，并不断对我国进行战争挑衅。这些情况使我们深深地认识到为生产建设和国防建设服务的体育事业的重要。因为体育运动的目的，在于增强人民体质，使人民具有健康的身体和坚强的意志，才能更好地为生产和国防服务，为胜利地完成第一个五年计划和解放台湾而斗争。
    几年来，我国的体育运动虽有很大的发展，但还远不能和我国的经济建设和国防建设相适应。广大群众，特别是工农群众参加体育运动还不够广泛。在条件较好的学校里，参加劳卫制或劳卫制预备级锻炼的学生也只有233万余人。运动技术水平也很低，除个别项目外，大都离国际水平很远。我国体育运动在国际上还远不能和我国在国际上的政治地位相比拟。这一切都使我们深深地感到作为一个光荣的中国运动员的责任的重大。
    我们能列席这次大会，充分地说明了党和政府对于体育事业是如何的重视与支持，对我们运动员是如何的爱护和关怀。周总理和其他首长们的报告以及所有同志们的发言，都给了我们深刻的教育和鼓舞。我们将和所有的运动员一样，决不辜负党、毛主席和政府对我们的关怀和期望。我们今后一定要加强学习，不断提高共产主义觉悟，积极锻炼，努力提高运动技术水平，推动国内群众性体育运动的开展，并在国际比赛中取得更大的胜利，使我国体育运动尽快地在广大人民群众中普及起来，并在技术上赶上或超过国际水平。
    陆琦的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意、并且衷心拥护周总理的政治报告及各位首长的重要报告。
    我是一个普通的开业医生，能够参加这次会议，参与国家大事，这是人民给我的最大荣誉，我感到无限的兴奋和荣幸。
    党和毛主席号召：在一个不长的时间内，赶上世界先进的科学文化水平。我们知识分子听后振奋之余，很自然地便要考虑到应如何来响应这一伟大号召而努力。作为一个医务工作者，我认为贯彻党对中西医团结的政策，做好学术交流，发掘与发扬祖国宝贵的医学遗产，应该也是努力的方法之一。现在就我的工作实践来简单地谈谈这个问题。
    我是个学外科的西医，外科病中痔疮是习见的普遍疾病之一，西医治痔方法甚多，有结扎、腐蚀、截除等疗法，虽有一定成效，但痛苦较多。后来我学习中医治痔疗法，将一个流传民间的中医治痔验方，加以整理，辅以西医器械，成为“内痔插药疗法”。结果疗效甚高，操作既简便，费用又省，且可使患者在治疗时不受痛苦。在我临床十余年中，治愈率约达80％。
    但是，在旧社会时，由于我的资产阶级“专利”思想，又鉴于社会上轻视中医，深恐人家知道我用中药验方，会讥笑我，因此，“内痔插药疗法”一直严守秘密，从不告诉别人。所以治疗对象局限于少数向我求治的患者。同时，个人才力有限，技术上很少改良，得不到提高。现在回忆起来，深感愧怍。解放后，在历次伟大的社会改革运动影响下，我认识到自己应该为人民保健事业作更多的贡献，1953年主动向人民政府表示了自己的态度，不久，便得到政府的重视和培养，指派医学界有学术地位的同志帮助我，指导我在浙江医学院第二医院进行实验，总结经验与缺点，使“内痔插药疗法”技术上很快地得到提高和发展。根据1954年3月至1955年6月，用这种方法治疗痔疮的115个患者中，结果109人痊愈，6人有进步。治愈率高达94.8％。1955年，浙江省卫生厅又调集了一部分医药界同志，举办“内痔插药疗法”训练班，我毫无保留地将秘方全部公开，和大家共同研究，现在已开始在政府领导下普遍地推广应用了。
    “内痔插药疗法”本来就是我们的祖先长期来和痔疮疾病作斗争所累积的宝贵经验，只要我们继承下来，便能应用到人民保健事业上面，便能为祖国的医学科学增光。但就丰富的祖国医学遗产说来，治痔疗法只不过是其中点滴而已，其他尚待我们发掘与发扬之处还是很多很多。
    在“内痔插药疗法”得到迅速的提高和广泛的应用这一现实教育中，我为党对科学技术的正确领导及对人民健康的细心关怀，深为感动。我决定参加国家医疗机构工作，争取在党的直接领导与教育下，在医学界同志们的指导帮助下，努力提高自己的政治水平与业务水平，为争取祖国文化科学的发展而奋斗。
    顾敬心的发言主席、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周总理和各位首长的报告。
    我坚决相信在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，一定能够胜利实现伟大的祖国社会主义改造和建设。
    我们知识分子，经过六年来亲身所见到和感到的体会，应该深切地认识到：只有跟了共产党走才能救国救民；才能移风易俗；才能消灭灾难，向那光明和幸福的道路前进；才能研究科学，很快追上世界技术水平。因为只有中国共产党和毛主席才能真正大公无私地为人民服务；能团结和改造全国人民，共同努力建设社会主义社会；能深思远虑，全面规划，不断提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。我们很多知识分子，解放前不懂得马克思列宁主义，不了解共产党，走了许多的弯路，马齿徒增，不仅没有发挥知识分子的力量，甚至由于个人主义和资产阶级思想，不知不觉做了些反人民的事情。现在应痛改前非，迎头赶上，要和工人农民一道发挥每个人的积极性和创造性，努力建设社会主义社会。今后我不但要以共产党员的标准来衡量自己，改造自己；不但要懂得马克思列宁主义，跟着共产党走，还应该在工作中立功，争取入党，成为社会主义建设的先锋队，成为名符其实的马克思列宁主义工程师。
    我是一个石油工业工作者。大家知道石油是工业、农业、国防、运输上不可缺少的物资；没有石油，汽车、拖拉机和飞机都不能开动。可是这正是我国目前国民经济发展中最薄弱的一环。解放六年来在党和政府的正确领导下，一面组织力量进行全国普查，积极勘察钻探和找寻天然石油资源，同时一面大力发展页岩的干溜、煤的干溜、煤的气化、气体合成及高压添氢等人造石油。我们石油工业工作者坚决相信在党和毛主席英明领导下，一定能够找到很多天然石油和制造出大量人造石油来满足祖国的需要。
    现在就页岩干溜工业来说，六年来原油产量已提高10倍左右。过去不能使用而抛弃的小块页岩，现已大部利用。对页岩干溜的操作技术也有很大进步，过去需要35吨左右原页岩才能炼制一吨原油，现在已能从28吨左右原页岩炼油一吨。为了减少损失，提高产量，正依据苏联专家建议和我国页岩干溜工厂试验结果，要把页岩干溜气体中过去没有利用的轻质油回收（精制后可做成汽油）；同时还要增设页岩预热装置，使原有页岩干溜炉的处理量大大提高。这两个技术措施实现后，不算扩建和新建的，从现有设备就可把当前我国页岩干溜工业的原油产量提高40％以上。我们石油工业工作者还正在积极研究着页岩干溜炉的干溜和汽化条件，以及炉型问题，还要进一步研究页岩粿粒和粉末的有效利用。我们完全有信心在五年以内能够达到20吨原页岩出一吨油。我们也相信，抚顺式页岩干溜炉，增设了预热，改进了通风和汽化条件后，能成为世界上先进的页岩干溜炉型。
    当然人造石油工业是个年轻而复杂的工业。我们急需学习先进技术和经验，同时必须要机械工业及煤炭工业和其他部门的支援，更需要全国人民的重视和支援。我满怀信心，我国人造石油在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在苏联和其他人民民主国家的专家帮助下，12年内一定能够辉煌壮大和发展成就，达到世界人造石油的技术水平。
    最后我觉得多阅读技术资料，多交流技术经验是提高科学技术水平的关键问题，也是工程技术人员在生长和发展技能中必不可少的东西。近年来由于某些干部对保密工作处理不够恰当，常常只要有数字或只要是蓝图，不论重轻，不管新旧，一律盖上密件和绝密的印鉴，形成保密第一，往往使许多工程技术人员就没有机会看到这种具有技术研究和改进的资料。就是即使能看到一点，也因不准拿出室外和不准抄录，亦不能长久记忆。同样关于技术经验交流，也以限于保密和制度，使原来有些本应交流的经验，为此作罢。有些虽经长时间联系，虽然得以交流，也以事过境迁，已不能起应有的作用。为了加速提高我国工程技术人员的水平和加速培养新生技术力量，今后除一部分真正重要的技术资料，必须严密保管以防泄密外，其他技术资料，不但要让工程技术人员阅读，而且还要有计划地组织他们来阅读。同时要经常举行技术经验交流会，召开专业讨论会，有计划地举办参观等等，使能截长补短，相互学习，不断提高，改进工作，来保证我们科学技术水平的迅速前进。
    郭可明的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我能应邀列席参加这个大会，感到非常的荣幸。我们听了周总理的“政治报告”和各位首长、各位委员的报告，我表示完全的同意和衷心地拥护。
    近来，全国各地正进行着社会主义改造，尤其是目前对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造更是飞快。全国人民都在积极地向着社会主义挺进，人民的生活逐步提高了，越来越幸福了。可是，我们在愉快中，不要忘记正处在水深火热中的台湾同胞。我完全拥护周总理报告中的和平解放台湾的号召，争取早日解放台湾的同胞，同我们一道，建设美好的社会主义社会。
    我是一个医务工作者，我们一定要牢固地团结在党的周围，竭力发挥我们的一切力量，把祖国的医学文化遗产向前发展一步，为祖国、为人民做出更大的贡献。
    在这里我愿意把我的一些认识和工作情况向诸位同志谈一谈：
    我国医学由于旧中国半封建半殖民地的特殊社会性质，形成了两种基础不同的医学同时发展，互争长短。在人事上不能团结，在学术上不能交流，因而造成了中西医间的鸿沟。
    自从解放以后，医学工作者在党和人民政府、毛主席的英明、正确领导下，中央人民政府卫生部贯彻全国卫生会议卫生工作四项原则的决议，展开了一系列的指示和措施。团结中西医，为人民服务，是毛主席早在数十年前即已明确指示的一项卫生工作方针，是党和人民政府一项重要政策。坚决贯彻党的政策，积极发挥中医力量，整理和提高我国医学文化遗产，借以丰富现代医学科学，保障人民健康，是一项极为重要的艰巨任务。
    四、五年来，特别是去年，贯彻对待中医的正确政策之后，各地先后成立了中医学会、中医进修学校、中医院、中医门诊部、中医联合诊所、中医研究机构，各大医院注意吸收中医参加医疗工作，医药院、校建立了中医中药研究组织，开办训练班，组织中西医交流经验等等，这些无疑地是人民保健事业上的新气象，会给人民的保健事业带来新的力量，而且有了初步的收获，这证明了党对中医政策的正确性。
    1954年我参加了石家庄市人民医院的治疗工作，治疗流行性“乙型”脑炎，取得了中西医间的初步合作，而收获了一些成绩。所以有成绩的原因，是在对待中医的正确政策之后党和毛主席正确的领导，中西医的合作，有领导有组织地发挥集体力量而取得的。虽然我有30多年的临床经验，终因胸无成竹，没有做出更大的贡献，感到惭愧。由于个人对中西医学认识不足，在见解、治疗当中，不一定完全正确，谬误之处在所难免，尚希不吝指摘，以匡不逮。
    1955年度治疗流行性“乙型”脑炎工作概况
    今年治疗流行性“乙型”脑炎，仍本1954年治疗流行性“乙型”脑炎的总精神：解毒、清热、填阴。为响应政府号召，厉行节约，积累资金，建设社会主义，开动了脑筋，羚羊、犀角等贵重药品，比去年用的少的多了。价格便宜、疗效很高的石膏却比去年用的多了，但治疗的效果并不亚于去年。今年用药和去年比较，节约数字是不少的。拿一个病人平均药费来计算，去年在两个星期左右出院的平均药费在45元左右，今年约在两星期左右出院的平均药费在15元上下。去年四、五天出院的平均药费在4.5元左右，今年四、五天出院的平均药费在1.5元上下。如果全国将来都按这样的办法治疗，那么，节约的数字就可想而知了。
    在1955年12月19日，我们获得了祖国对我们的奖励和表扬。我们深深地体会到党和毛主席对我们的无比关怀。
    所以有今天的光荣，是由于党和毛主席的英明、正确领导。这光荣归功于党，归功于我们伟大的领袖毛主席。
    今后，回到工作岗位上，更要发挥出自己的一切力量，为人民的卫生健康事业做出更大的贡献，以支援祖国的社会主义建设，为早日实现社会主义而奋斗！为早
  日解放台湾同胞而奋斗！
    最后，祝各位首长、各位委员身体健康。
    王达甫的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周主席的政治报告，及政协各位副主席及陈伯达委员的报告。尤其是读了周总理在中共中央召开的会议上所做的关于知识分子问题的报告以后，感觉到党和政府对知识分子的关怀是无微不至，既恳切而又周到，深深地使我感动和振奋，深刻地体会到生活在毛泽东时代的知识分子是被政府重视的，是幸福的。同时我也感觉到在社会主义建设大规模的飞速发展中，知识分子们的任务亦是非常艰巨而光荣的。这个政策的贯彻，肯定是可以把知识分子的力量最充分地动员和发挥出来。
    由于农业合作化高潮汹涌澎湃的到来，棉粮产量激剧增加，我河北省地区国营纺织工业的建厂任务今年比1955年增大了约8倍，因而感觉到落在我们纺织工程技术人员身上的责任是更加艰巨而光荣。再看一下我们纺织厂生产技术水平，则是普遍存在着产品质量低、品种少、设备陈旧与劳动生产率不高的现象，远远地落后于苏联的先进水平后面。周总理对知识分子提出最充分地发挥力量，不断地提高政治觉悟和业务水平，大规模地培养新生力量来扩大队伍以适应国家不断增长的要求的号召，是完全正确的与适时的。郭沫若副主席在这些方面于报告中亦指出了明确的努力方向。我对于这些问题有以下几点建议和意见，提请政府及有关部门考虑：
    一、为了最充分地动员和发挥工程技术人员的力量，除去在使用和待遇方面的某些不合理现象应予解决外，我认为在纺织企业中主要应解决新老技术干部间及同辈技术干部间的不团结问题。青年干部一般地都靠拢组织，政治觉悟较高，接受新鲜事物与学习先进经验较快，但实际生产经验不够充实，考虑问题不够缜密全面，年长的技术干部则恰恰与此相反，因而互相轻视不团结现象于焉产生。应针对这些情况予以适当解决以收群策群力之效。
    二、关于大规模地培养新生力量来扩大工程技术人员的队伍问题，我认为在企业部门主要是做好各级技术干部的在职培养和提高的工作的问题：
      1、对于各级干部的培养与提高，纺织工业部、纺织管理局与纺织厂三级应订出明确的分工负责的详细规划，分别执行各级应培养的任务。
    2、局和厂要办好业余的技术进修班或业余技术学校，在一定时期内，使初中级的技术人员提高到高中级的技术程度，高中级的技术人员提高到大学或专科级的工程技术人员的技术和理论水平。并应及时做好晋级与提拔工作，以逐步扩大高级工程技术人员的队伍。
    3、加强大学与专科新毕业生的实习辅导与工作考绩的工作。企业的总工程师应负起这一工作的领导责任，单纯地靠人事部门或技术教育部门的职能人员，是不能搞好这一工作也不能达到预期要求的目的的。
    4、高级技术人员必须经常耐心地针对生产上的具体技术问题的解决，对中级和低级技术干部进行有效而具体的指导与教育，亦是培养新生技术力量工作中的一个重要环节。
    三、关于提高工程技术人员的业务水平问题，除去应加强他们的马列主义的理论学习外，我的意见应做好以下几个工作：
    1、认真学习苏联先进经验和切实地贯彻苏联专家的建议。
    纺织工业部的十几位苏联专家，各有专长，如可能的话，应请各专家有计划地定期地到各纺织中心区进行专业性的工作检查，针对各厂存在的主要问题提出建议，各有关企业应组织讨论与学习研究专家所提建议，并订出试验和执行计划予以认真贯彻。
    2、由部定期组织类似1954年在青岛召开的全国性纺织技术专业会议，以交流各地区的成熟先进经验，使各纺织厂能够互相学习，共同把技术水平提高一步。
    3、局和厂的领导应合理地安排工程技术人员的工作，必须尽量减少他们的事务主义，保证其有充分的深入车间及做专业活动的时间。
    4、支持他们的生产时间内每周数小时的业务学习与技术专题讨论的时间，保证这几小时不被其他会议占去。（现在虽有规定但时间无保证。）
    5、业余时间亦应适当安排，不应让党、团及工会的活动全部占去，至少应抽出两个晚上（每周）给他们以在业余从事科学研究的自修或集体研究活动的时间上的便利。这样才能使他们的感性知识与理论水平同时获得不断地提高。
    6、纺织工业部应责成各纺织管理局亦要着手筹备成立地区的有关纺织工业的科学研究机构，拨给所需的购置仪器基金，配备相应的研究人员，使能在中央纺织研究院指导下，开展结合改进生产技术上实际需要的研究工作。这也是在向科学技术大进军工作中的一个应解决的重要问题。
    我是一个年龄将近60岁的已从事纺织技术工作30余年的老技术人员，在旧社会中曾经沾染了严重的资产阶级思想和作风。解放后六年来在党的培养教育下，参加了政治学习及几次宏伟的社会改革和思想改造运动，已根本上克服了过去为“挣钱吃饭”的单纯技术观点，初步建立了竭尽所能为人民服务的思想，但仍残留有落后保守、自由散漫以及个人主义等旧思想的残余。参加了这次大会使我受到深刻的教育，我保证今后在党的领导下，努力学习马克思列宁主义的理论，加强自我教育，认真地进行自我改造，做好团结新老技术人员及局厂各领导同志的工作，积极钻研与学习苏联先进经验以不断提高我的政治觉悟和业务水平，并坚决地响应郭沫若副主席的号召“以共产党员的标准要求自己”，学习他们对党无限忠诚，全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质及他们的布尔什维克的有效而具体的领导作风，并经常以“三省三问”的方法来鞭策自己，为了争取在生产上做出又多、又快、又好、又省的成绩，并为了在我国于12年内赶上世界纺织工业的先进水平的工作中做出自己的最大可能的贡献，使我能逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子而努力奋斗！
