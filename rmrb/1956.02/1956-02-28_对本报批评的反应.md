    Responses to the Newspaper's Criticisms
    In its December 5th article last year, "Why Can't the Ping'an Mine Fully Implement Regular Cyclic Operations Throughout the Mine?" this newspaper criticized the Fuxin Mining Bureau's Ping'an Mine for not effectively promoting the advanced experience of regular cyclic operations. Zhang Guanghua and Chen Haishan, deputy directors of the Ping'an Mine, have already sent letters of self-criticism and proposed four measures, including genuinely changing their leadership style and vigorously promoting advanced experience.
    In its December 2nd article last year, "Prevent Hasty Punishments," this newspaper criticized the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company for hastily punishing and expelling workers. The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company has now sent a letter of self-criticism.
    In its January 8th article, "What Is the Purpose of On-Time Operation?" this newspaper criticized the Jilin and Tumen sub-bureaus of the Jilin Railway Bureau for failing to promptly load less-than-carload (LCL) freight from stations along the line, affecting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The Jilin Railway Bureau has now sent a letter of self-criticism and proposed measures to ensure the timely loading of LCL freight.
