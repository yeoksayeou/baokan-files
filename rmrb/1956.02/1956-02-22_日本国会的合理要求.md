    The Reasonable Demands of the Japanese Diet

    On February 9th and 10th, the Japanese House of Representatives and the House of Councillors successively passed the "Resolution Demanding the Prohibition of Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Testing." The Japanese government has sent this resolution to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, hoping they will give it full consideration.

    The Japanese people are the initial and greatest victims of the atomic bomb. They have been struggling against turning Japan into an atomic base and against the United States testing atomic and hydrogen bombs in the Pacific. As of December 20, last year, the number of people nationwide in Japan who signed petitions demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs had exceeded 33 million. The Japanese Diet's resolution precisely reflects this desire of the Japanese people.

    This resolution of the Japanese Diet has already received support from the Soviet Union. When the Japanese government sent it to Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Sobolev, asking him to forward it to the Soviet government, Sobolev immediately stated: "The Soviet Union has consistently and enthusiastically advocated the prohibition of such tests, and we sympathize with this resolution. The Soviet government will undoubtedly be pleased to welcome it." This attitude of the Soviet Union stems from its consistent position of advocating the prohibition of atomic weapons. As everyone knows, in United Nations bodies and other international conferences, the Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward proposals to prohibit atomic weapons and has been making unremitting efforts to this end.

    However, the United States has adopted a different attitude. U.S. government officials made statements on February 9th, openly rejecting the demands of the Japanese Diet, on the grounds that "testing cannot be stopped until the issue of international control of atomic energy is resolved." This is a complete pretext. In fact, it is precisely the United States itself that has been obstructing the realization of international control of atomic energy and using atomic weapons testing to create tension. Recently, some prominent figures in the United States have even openly clamored that they cannot abandon atomic weapons as a "trump card," attempting to engage in blackmail and intimidation. This is the real reason why the United States refuses to accept the resolution of the Japanese Diet.

    In order to ease the Japanese people's resistance to U.S. atomic weapons testing in the Pacific, U.S. government officials specifically stated in their February 9th remarks that the United States would be willing to consider "the issue of compensation" if the Japanese people were harmed. According to the thinking of these atomic weapons fanatics, it seems that as long as they throw down a few dollars, they can buy off the lives and safety interests of the Japanese people. This is a great insult to the dignity of the Japanese people!

    The U.S. plan to continue testing atomic and hydrogen bombs in the Pacific region is a threat to the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific. Prime Minister Nehru has repeatedly called for a halt to hydrogen bomb testing. The public in Burma, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries has also unanimously protested against this U.S. action that threatens the safety of the people of all countries. The Japanese people's desire to stop hydrogen bomb testing is completely consistent with the desires of the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific. The Chinese people express full sympathy and support for this. We believe that in the struggle against U.S. hydrogen bomb testing, if the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific can unite as one, they can form a tremendous moral force to stop U.S. provocative activities.

### 日本国会的合理要求

    日本国会的合理要求
    2月9日和10日，日本国会众议院和参议院先后通过“要求禁止试验原子弹和氢弹决议案”。日本政府已将这个决议案送给了美国、英国和苏联政府，希望它们加以充分考虑。
    日本人民是原子弹最初和最大的受害者。他们为了反对把日本变为原子基地，反对美国在太平洋试验原子弹和氢弹，一直在进行斗争。到去年12月20日为止，日本全国签名要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的人数已超过了3，300万人。日本议会的决议，正是反映了日本人民的这一愿望。
    日本国会的这个决议已经得到了苏联方面的支持。当日本政府把它送给苏联驻美国大使索波列夫请他转交苏联政府时，索波列夫立即表示：“苏联是一贯热心地主张禁止这种试验，我们对这个决议表示同情。苏联政府（对这个决议）无疑会高兴地表示欢迎。”苏联这种态度是从它主张禁止原子武器的一贯立场出发的。大家知道，在联合国机构中和其他国际会议上，苏联曾经一再提出禁止原子武器的建议，并且为此作着不懈的努力。
    但是，美国却采取了另外一种态度。美国政府负责人在2月9日发表谈话，公开拒绝了日本国会的要求，理由是“在国际管制原子能问题实现以前，不能停止试验”。这完全是遁词。事实上，不是别人，恰恰是美国自己一直阻挠着国际管制原子能问题的实现，并利用原子武器的试验来制造紧张局势。近来，美国的某些显要人物甚至公开叫喊他们不能放弃原子武器这张“王牌”，妄图进行讹诈和恫吓。这就是美国不肯接受日本国会的决议的真正原因。
    为了缓和日本人民对美国在太平洋试验原子武器的反抗情绪，美国政府负责人在2月9日的谈话中特意表示，如果日本人民受到损害，美国愿意考虑“赔偿的问题”。按照这些原子武器的狂热者的想法，好像只要抛下几块美元，就可以收买日本人民的生命和安全利益。这是对日本人民尊严的莫大污辱！
    美国计划在太平洋地区继续试验原子弹和氢弹，是对整个亚洲及太平洋地区各国人民的威胁。尼赫鲁总理曾经不止一次地呼吁停止氢弹试验。缅甸、印度尼西亚、澳大利亚、新西兰等国的公众，也对美国这一威胁各国人民安全的行动一致表示抗议。日本人民要求停止氢弹试验的愿望，是和亚洲及太平洋地区各国人民的愿望完全一致的。中国人民对此表示充分的同情和支持。我们相信，在反对美国试验氢弹的斗争中，亚洲和太平洋地区的各国人民如果能够团结一致，那么就能形成巨大的道义力量，制止美国的挑衅活动。
