Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th (TASS) – The Soviet Council of Ministers recently considered the issue of the breeding and protection of Far Eastern salmon. In view of the declining production of this salmon and the danger of extinction, the Soviet Council of Ministers instructed the relevant authorities to draft proposals for emergency measures to protect salmon breeding.

    It is known that Far Eastern salmon grow and develop in the rivers of Kamchatka, Sakhalin, the coast of the Sea of ​​Okhotsk, and the Amur Basin. The main occupation of the residents of these areas is salmon fishing, which provides raw materials for the production of the most valuable fish products in the Soviet Far East.

    The physiological characteristic of Far Eastern salmon is that they breed only once in their lifetime in the rivers of the Soviet Far East, that is, they migrate from the ocean to the rivers to spawn. After the juvenile salmon grow up in fresh water, they move to the ocean to live, and later return to their original rivers to spawn. Their production depends not only on the breeding conditions in the rivers and the protection measures taken there, but also mainly on the number of salmon entering the rivers from the ocean.

    For many years, the relevant Soviet agencies have been taking extensive measures and allocating large amounts of funds to protect and increase salmon. However, existing scientific and fishing statistics show that the number of salmon has decreased significantly in recent years. This is the result of Japanese fishermen increasingly arbitrarily catching salmon in the high seas and on the routes salmon take to spawning grounds. Moreover, the fishing nets cast by Japanese fishing vessels in some places almost completely prevent salmon from swimming into freshwater spawning grounds. According to estimates by the Soviet competent authorities, only 10% to 15% of the salmon that need to breed normally were able to reach the rivers along the Okhotsk-Kamchatka coast in 1955 alone. This situation is bound to lead to the rapid extinction of Far Eastern salmon.

    Obviously, the current situation will inevitably affect the world's food resources. It not only damages the interests of the Soviet people, but also the interests of the people of other countries, including Japan.

    In view of the above situation, the Soviet Council of Ministers instructed the Soviet Ministry of Fisheries and other relevant agencies to draft proposals for emergency measures to prevent the indiscriminate fishing of salmon on salmon migration routes. These measures will cease to be implemented after the conclusion of relevant international agreements on the protection of salmon and the regulation of salmon fishing.

### 苏联将采取措施保护远东鲑鱼的繁殖

    苏联将采取措施保护远东鲑鱼的繁殖
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科10日讯　苏联部长会议在不久以前考虑了远东鲑鱼的繁殖和保护问题。鉴于这种鲑鱼的产量日益减少而且面临绝种的危险，苏联部长会议指示有关机关草拟关于保护鲑鱼繁殖的紧急措施的建议。
    大家知道，远东鲑鱼是在堪察加、库页岛、鄂霍次克海岸和阿穆尔盆地的河流里发育成长的。这些地区的居民的主要职业就是捕鲑鱼，为苏联的远东地区提供制造最有价值的鱼产品的原料。
    远东鲑鱼的生理特点是：它们一生中在苏联远东地区的江河中繁殖一次，即从海洋游到江河产卵。幼鲑在淡水中长大以后就转移到海洋中生活，后来又回到原来的江河中产卵。它们的产量不但取决于江河的繁殖条件和在那里采取的保护措施，而且主要取决于从海洋进入江河的鲑鱼数量。
    许多年来苏联的有关机构一直在采取广泛的措施和拨出大量的经费，来保护和增殖鲑鱼。但是，现有的科学和捕鱼统计表明，最近几年来鲑鱼的数量大大减少。这是由于日本渔民在公海和鲑鱼通向产卵地点的路线上越来越任意地捕鲑鱼的结果。而且日本渔船在某些地方所撒下的鱼网，几乎完全妨碍了鲑鱼游进淡水产卵场。根据苏联主管机关的估计，单是在1955年，需要正常地繁殖的鲑鱼只有10％到15％能够抵达鄂霍次克—堪察加沿海地区的江河中。这种情况势必使远东鲑鱼很快就要绝种。
    显然，现存的局势不得不影响到世界食物资源的情况，它不但损害苏联人民的利益，而且也损害包括日本在内的其他国家人民的利益。
    鉴于上述情况，苏联部长会议指示苏联渔业部和其他有关机关草拟防止在鲑鱼移殖路线上滥捕鲑鱼的紧急措施的建议。等到有关保护鲑鱼和规定捕捉鲑鱼的国际协定缔结以后，这些措施将停止执行。
