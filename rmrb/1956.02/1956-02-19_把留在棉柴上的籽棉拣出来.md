Pick Out the Seed Cotton Left on the Cotton Stalks
Editor:

    Every year after the cotton harvest, some un-fluffed cotton bolls are pulled up along with the cotton stalks. Although the quality of the cotton in these bolls is not very good, it can still be utilized. It would be a great waste to burn them along with the cotton stalks or use them for composting.

    In the winter of 1955, many agricultural cooperatives in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, first used stone rollers to press the cotton stalks when composting, and then picked out the seed cotton from the cotton bolls that were crushed open. Jiaqiang Agricultural Cooperative pressed 480,000 jin of cotton stalks and picked out a total of 1,000 jin of seed cotton. Dongkang Agricultural Cooperative also picked out 1,400 jin of seed cotton from the dry bolls of 500,000 jin of cotton stalks. This practice is very good, and it is hoped that other regions can also adopt it to prevent the waste of useful cotton.

    把留在棉柴上的籽棉拣出来编辑同志：
    每年棉花收获以后，总有一些还没有吐絮的棉铃随着棉柴一起被拔掉了。这些棉铃里的棉花，虽然质量不大好，但还是可以利用的。如果将它们随着棉柴烧掉，或者用来沤粪，实在很可惜。
    1955年冬天，山西省临汾县不少农业社在用棉柴沤肥的时候，先用石磙子把棉柴压一下，就把那些被压开的棉铃里的籽棉拣出来了。贾墙农业社压了48万斤棉柴，一共拣出1，000斤籽棉，东亢农业社也在50万斤棉柴的枯铃上拣出了籽棉1，400斤。这种做法很好，希望其他地区也能采用，不让有用的棉花白白浪费掉。
