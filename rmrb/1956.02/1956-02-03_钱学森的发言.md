    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, as well as the various reports made by Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and Vice Chairman Dong Biwu.
    I am a technical science worker. I was only able to leave the United States and return to the motherland four months ago. Everywhere I look, I see the motherland making rapid progress towards the path of socialism, which excites me immensely. But at the same time, I think of the many Chinese students who have not yet been able to break free from the unreasonable obstruction of the American government. We must work even harder to fight for their freedom so that they can return to the embrace of the motherland.
    Now, facing the major topic placed before us: "Catching up with the world's scientific level in 12 years," I am even more encouraged by this great task. Speaking of our country's science and technology, it lags behind the world's advanced countries by decades. If we don't catch up, even if the Party and government give us strong support, in a few more decades, we will at most reach the current level of advanced countries, but they will have moved forward decades more than us. So, at that time, we will still be lagging behind by decades. This is very clear. Therefore, the necessity of catching up is recognized by everyone. The question is whether this major task can be completed in a relatively short period of 12 years.
    Let's first look at another matter, the situation of students studying abroad. I am not familiar with others, but I know about the Chinese students who went to study in the United States. A student who graduated from a university before liberation, under the guidance of famous teachers in the United States, requires 5 or 6 years to be trained into a scientific researcher with advanced skills who can work independently. Now our universities have absorbed the teaching experience of the Soviet Union, greatly improving their level. Therefore, the post-graduation training time can be shortened. It is completely reasonable and achievable to train university graduates into associate doctors in 4 years.
    Now let's take a look at whether we have
  "famous teachers" in our country. I think we don't need to be too modest. We do have famous teachers, and that is some of our well-known scientists. They have already reached the world level in their respective fields, and some have even reached the forefront of their departments, being the most advanced scientists. These famous teachers were
  "heroes without a place to use their skills" before liberation, and they could not teach a large number of young scientists. But now it is different. Living and research conditions have improved, so it is entirely possible for us to cultivate scientific talents domestically. Of course, we cannot deny that the number of all our good teachers is pathetically small in terms of need, and their distribution in various scientific departments is also very uneven, with many blank spots and missing fields. But we are not isolated. We have the selfless help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. If we lack a discipline, we can send students to study abroad in that discipline, or we can invite experts to come here. So these blank spots are not difficult to fill.
    But some people may say: even if every science has people, how many people can be trained in a short time of 12 years! Okay, let's do the math carefully: If a teacher can take one apprentice every year, the apprentice will complete their studies and obtain an associate doctoral degree in 4 years. Then we take a new apprentice, and after studying for two years, the teacher can then bring another grand-apprentice through them. In this way, I have carefully calculated that a teacher can train 89 associate doctors in 12 years. One becomes 89, which is not a small number. Therefore, it is possible to train a sufficient number of senior researchers in 12 years. Of course, we must pay attention to the fact that in order to do this, each teacher and senior apprentice must teach an average of four apprentices at the same time, and no unqualified waste products are allowed. This is a very heavy burden. But this is not impossible either, if we can learn from the working masses and see how they complete and overfulfill their tasks. Obviously, there are two points to learn: first, we must clarify the relationship between teachers and apprentices, be responsible for teaching, and be responsible for learning, that is, "guaranteed teaching and guaranteed learning." Second, we must be able to use collective work methods, adopt discussion meetings in research, offer opinions selflessly, and not be afraid to ask everyone about difficulties. In the past, training cadres inevitably involved a laissez-faire style, and young people had opinions about their teachers. Research work was also often afraid of open discussion, and even if there was discussion, it was not fair and strict criticism, emphasizing the false politeness of intellectuals! But I believe that under the leadership of the Party, in the national socialist upsurge, these old habits of intellectuals will naturally be washed away. At the same time, as long as we can learn, can apply the best tool of scientific research—dialectical materialism—to our work, can delve into practice, and gain sensitivity to new things and new environments, we will quickly become active scientific and technological workers. At that time, our scientific and technological team will surely become an invincible army, and the task of catching up with the world's scientific level in 12 years can definitely be completed.

    钱学森的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，和李济深副主席、郭沫若副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武副主席所做的各项报告。
    我是一个技术科学工作者。在4个月前才能脱离了美国回到祖国。我到处看到祖国在突飞猛进地向社会主义的道路迈进，这使我万分地兴奋。但同时也想到许多尚未能摆脱美国政府无理阻挠的中国留学生，我们必需更加努力，为取得他们的自由而斗争，使得他们能回到祖国的怀抱中来。
    现在碰到放在我们面前的一个大题目：“12年迎头赶上世界科学水平”，我更为这个伟大的任务所鼓舞。说到我国的科学和技术，它落后于世界先进国家几十年，如果不迎头赶上，即使党和政府给我们大力支持，再过几十年，大不了做到现在先进国家的水平，而人家那时又比我们多走了几十年，所以到那时也还是落后了几十年。这个道理很明白，因此，迎头赶上去的必要性，是谁都承认的。问题在：是不是在12年这一个比较短促的时期内，可以完成这一项重大的任务。
    我们先看一看另外一件事，留学生的情况。别的我不熟悉，到美国留学的中国学生我是知道的。一个在解放前从高等学校毕业的学生，在美国经名师指导，要5年或6年才可以培养成为一个有先进水平的，能独立工作的科学研究员。现在我们的高等学校，吸收了苏联的教学经验，大大地提高了它们的水平。因此，毕业后的进修时间是可以缩短的，从高等学校毕业生以4年培养成副博士的规格，是完全合理的，能实现的。
    现在我们再看一看我们国内有没有
  “名师”。我想我们也不必太客气，名师是有的，那就是我们的一些知名的科学家，他们都早已分别地达到了世界水平，有的甚而已经走到他们自己部门的最前线，是最先进的科学家。这些名师在解放前是
  “英雄无用武之地”，没有能教出大量的青年科学家来，但是现在是不同了，生活和研究条件都有了改进，所以我们在国内培养科学人才是完全可能的。自然，我们不能否认：我们所有的好老师对需要来讲，在数量上是少得可怜，而且以科学各部门中的分布来看，也是很不平均，空白点和缺门多。但是我们不是孤立的，我们有苏联和其他兄弟国家无私的帮助。我们缺那一门，我们就可以在那一门派留学生出国去学，也可以请专家到我们这里来。所以这些空白点是不难补上的。
    但是有人也许要说：就是每一门科学都有了人，12年这一个短时间又能培养出多少人！好，让我们来算一算细账：如果一个老师每年能收一个徒弟，4年后徒弟学成，得副博士学位。我们再收一个新徒弟，学过两年后，老师就能通过他再多带一个徒孙。这样的话，我仔细算过，一个老师12年后就能培养出89个副博士，一个变89个，这不能算少了。所以要在12年中培养出足够数量的高级研究人员，是可以做到的。自然，我们要注意到，要做到如此，每一位老师和大徒弟平均每人同时要教四个徒弟，而且，还不许出不成才的废品。这是很重的担子。但是这也不是不可能的，如果我们能向工人群众学习，看看他们是怎样完成和超额完成他们的任务的。显然有两点可学：第一是要严明师徒关系，要负责教，要负责学，即要“包教包学”。第二是要能运用集体工作方法，研究中采用讨论会方式，有意见就无私地提出，有困难也不怕问大家。在过去，培养干部是不免自由作风，青年对老师是有意见的。研究工作中也常常怕公开讨论，即讨论也不公正严格地批评，讲究文人的一套假客气！但是我相信：在党的领导下，在全国社会主义的高潮中，知识分子的这些老习惯会自然而然的被冲洗掉。同时只要我们能学习，能把科学研究的最好工具——辩证唯物论，运用到业务上去，能深入实践，取得对新事物、新环境的敏感，我们会很快地变成积极的科学技术劳动者。那时我们的科学技术队伍必然成为一支战无不胜的大军，12年赶上世界科学水平的任务是一定可以完成的。
