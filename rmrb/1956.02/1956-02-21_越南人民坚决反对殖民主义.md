    The Vietnamese People Resolutely Oppose Colonialism
    Sun Desheng, Chairman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front
    The Vietnamese people warmly welcome February 21st and hail the spirit of solidarity and struggle of youth worldwide against colonialism.

    Since World War II, many oppressed countries in Asia and Africa have been liberated from the shackles of colonialism and semi-colonialism. More than half of humanity has escaped the dark prison of imperialism and is building its own independent nation. The great victory of the 600 million people of China has powerfully inspired the national liberation movements of various countries. The historically significant Bandung Conference achieved brilliant success, demonstrating that the world is in a high tide of national liberation.

    The spirit of the Bandung Conference is penetrating deeply among the people of the oppressed countries, prompting them to unite more closely to quickly end the brutal colonial rule. The anti-colonialism movement has become a political force of significant importance in the development of the current international situation.

    The imperialist bloc, headed by U.S. imperialism, has suffered shameful defeats in China, Korea, Vietnam, and many other countries, and they have sensed that the ground beneath their feet is collapsing. Therefore, they are playing various cunning schemes to try to revive colonialism in new forms. They hide behind the guise of various "economic aid" and various military blocs such as the Baghdad Pact, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, etc., to infringe upon the sovereignty, territory, and independence of various countries, plunder their resources, and attempt to use the youth of various countries as cannon fodder for the new world war they are intensifying preparations for.

    Therefore, the people of the oppressed countries oppose all kinds of military aggression blocs precisely to defend their own independence, protect the future of their nation and descendants, and at the same time defend world peace. In the struggle for national liberation, they have gained the powerful support of the mighty camp including the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, as well as peace-loving people all over the world.

    The Vietnamese people, in order to fight for independence, freedom, and world peace, have carried out a struggle for nearly a century and have liberated the territory of the North. There, the youth and the people are working hard to eliminate the remnants of the colonial system and build a new life. Now, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, are maintaining colonial rule in South Vietnam, attempting to turn South Vietnam into a base for U.S. imperialism to carry out aggression and provoke war. In the great struggle for their own liberation and the defense of world peace, the Vietnamese people have strengthened their close solidarity with the people of Asia, Africa, and all countries more than ever before. Based on their own experience, the Vietnamese people know that no force can stop the wheels of national liberation from advancing. The oppressed nations of the world are rising up. In this great force, the youth are an active leading force. The liberation of the motherland will open up a beautiful future for them.

    Therefore, this year's February 21st, like in previous years, people and youth from all walks of life in Vietnam, together with the people and youth from all over the world, strongly condemn colonialism and strengthen the struggle for the cause of national liberation and world peace.

    越南人民坚决反对殖民主义
    越南祖国战线主席　孙德胜
    越南人民热烈迎接2月21日并欢呼全世界青年反对殖民主义的团结斗争精神。
    第二次世界大战以后，已经有许多亚洲和非洲的被压迫国家从殖民地和半殖民地的枷锁下解放出来。占人类一半以上的国家已经摆脱了帝国主义的黑暗牢狱，并且正在建设自己的独立国家。中国6亿人民的伟大胜利，有力地鼓舞了各国的民族解放运动。具有历史意义的万隆会议获得辉煌成就，表明了世界正处在民族解放的高潮。
    万隆会议的精神正深入到各被压迫国家的人民之间，促使他们为迅速结束残暴的殖民统治而日益紧密地团结起来。反对殖民主义运动已经成为目前国际形势发展中的一种具有重要作用的政治力量。
    以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团，在中国、朝鲜、越南和许多其他国家遭受到可耻的失败，他们已经感觉到脚底下的土地正在崩塌。因此他们玩弄各种狡猾的阴谋，以设法在新的形式下复活殖民主义。他们躲在各种“经济援助”的招牌和各种军事集团如巴格达集团、东南亚军事集团、北大西洋集团等等的后面，侵犯各国的主权、领土和独立，搜刮各国的资源，并企图利用各国青年在他们所加紧准备的新的世界大战中替他们充当炮灰。
    因此，各被压迫国家的人民反对各种军事侵略集团，正是为了捍卫本国的独立，保护自己的民族和子孙的前途，同时也是保卫世界和平。在为民族解放而进行的斗争中，他们获得包括苏联、中国和其他各社会主义国家的强大阵营以及全世界爱好和平人民的有力支援。
    越南人民为了争取独立、自由和世界和平，进行了将近一个世纪的斗争，已经解放了北方的国土。在那里，青年和人民正努力消除殖民制度的残余，建设新的生活。现在，美帝国主义及其仆从吴庭艳之流正在维持越南南方的殖民地统治，企图把越南南方变成美帝国主义进行侵略和挑拨战争的根据地。在争取自己的解放和保卫世界和平的伟大斗争中，越南人民比过去任何时候都更加强了同亚洲、非洲及各国人民的紧密团结。根据本身的经验，越南人民知道没有任何势力能够阻挡民族解放的车轮前进。全世界的被压迫民族正在站立起来。在这一伟大力量中，青年是积极带头的力量。祖国的解放将为他们开辟美丽的前途。
    因此，今年的2月21日，也和往年一样，越南各界人民和青年跟全世界各国的人民和青年一起，强烈谴责殖民主义，并加强为各民族的解放事业与世界和平而进行的斗争。
