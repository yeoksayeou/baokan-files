In the implementation of joint state-private ownership of private enterprises, a fair, reasonable, and realistic principle should be followed to inventory and value the actual property of the enterprise and determine the share of the private party. The handling of several major issues in the property inventory and valuation is now stipulated as follows:

(1) For machinery and equipment, valuation should be based on the degree of newness and obsolescence, with reference to the selling prices of state-owned industrial departments; if originally purchased from state-owned commercial departments, valuation can be based on the list prices of state-owned commercial departments; if the above prices are not available, valuation should be negotiated by both the public and private parties.

The degree of newness and obsolescence of machinery and equipment can be calculated using the formula: "Re-assessed remaining usable years + actual years used = total service life;" if the above formula is not suitable, it can also be estimated through consultation between the public and private parties.

(2) For houses, other buildings, and usable storefront renovation equipment, valuation should be based on the degree of newness and obsolescence, with reference to the valuation standards of local real estate management authorities; if the above prices are not available, valuation should be negotiated by both the public and private parties. Land should also be appropriately valued.

(3) Mineral deposits used by the enterprise will not be valued; equipment used for the development of mineral deposits that can be utilized should be valued.

(4) For tools and equipment used for production and operation, valuation should generally be based on the degree of newness and obsolescence, with reference to the list prices or market prices of state-owned commercial departments; if the above prices are not available, valuation should be negotiated by both the public and private parties.

(5) For finished products, valuation should generally be based on the purchasing prices of state-owned enterprises, less payable taxes; for work in progress, valuation should generally be based on the purchasing prices of finished products by state-owned enterprises, less payable taxes, and then appropriately valued according to the degree of completion; if there are no purchasing prices from state-owned enterprises, valuation should be negotiated by both the public and private parties. For finished products and work in progress that are of poor quality or slow-moving, valuation should be appropriately discounted with reference to the above methods.

For raw materials, supplies, etc., valuation should generally be based on the selling prices of state-owned industrial departments; if originally purchased from state-owned commercial departments, valuation can be based on the list prices of state-owned commercial departments; if the above prices are not available, valuation should be negotiated by both the public and private parties.

For commodities of commercial enterprises, valuation should generally be based on the wholesale prices of state-owned commercial departments; if there is no such wholesale price, valuation should be negotiated by both the public and private parties. For commodities that are of poor quality or slow-moving and should be sold at reduced prices, valuation should be appropriately discounted through consultation between the public and private parties.

(6) For the enterprise's stagnant materials, the public and private parties should negotiate and appropriately discount the price for investment as shares.

(7) The enterprise's original public reserve fund should generally be converted into private shares; if the enterprise originally had a portion of public shares, it should be converted into public and private shares according to the original proportion of public and private shares. If the enterprise's original employee collective welfare facilities are relatively poor, an appropriate portion can be extracted from the public reserve fund as the employee collective welfare fund of the joint state-private enterprise.

(8) Employee collective welfare equipment originally paid for under the enterprise's capital account should be valued as private shares; if the enterprise originally had a portion of public shares, it should be converted into public and private shares according to the original proportion of public and private shares. Employee collective welfare equipment originally funded by bonuses and employee welfare funds extracted from the enterprise's surplus should be transferred to the ownership of the joint state-private enterprise and not be counted as private shares.

(9) In enterprises where family, shop (factory) are not separated, the means of production specifically used for production and operation should be inventoried and valued as private shares; living materials specifically for family use should belong to the original owner. For property that is difficult to distinguish between production, operation, and family use, such as houses and furniture, the original owner can put forward opinions and negotiate the handling in accordance with the principle of taking care of the legitimate needs of the original owner's family.

(10) When an enterprise implements joint state-private ownership, if it needs to be relocated or merged, the enterprise's machinery, equipment, houses, land, and other buildings should be valued according to the situation before the relocation or merger. The costs of relocation and merger shall be borne by the joint state-private enterprise.

(11) For enterprises that have revalued their property and adjusted their capital according to the "Measures for Revaluing Property and Adjusting Capital of Private Enterprises" of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council in December 1950, if the revaluation results are relatively reasonable, they can be used as the basis for valuation after consultation between the public and private parties; at the same time, appropriate adjustments should be made based on asset depreciation and other changes.

(12) Joint state-private enterprises that have already conducted property inventory and valuation before the promulgation of these regulations should not change the original inventory and valuation results.

Joint state-private enterprises should make every effort to clear up the private shares' pending assets and convert them into shares.

(13) In order to enable the private party to work with peace of mind and accept transformation after the implementation of joint state-private ownership, the enterprise's original debt relationships, property relationships, and other related issues should be cleared up as much as possible during property inventory and valuation.

    国务院关于私营企业实行公私合营的时候对财产清理估价几项主要问题的规定
    （1956年2月8日国务院全体会议第二十四次会议通过）
    私营企业实行公私合营的时候，应当根据公平合理、实事求是的原则，对企业的实有财产进行清理估价，确定私方的股额。现在将财产清理估价中几项主要问题的处理，作如下的规定：
    （一）对机器、设备，按照新旧程度，参照国营工业部门的出售价格进行估价；如果原来是向国营商业部门买进的，可以参照国营商业部门的牌价进行估价；如果没有上述价格，由公私双方协商估价。
    机器设备的新旧程度，可以用“重新鉴定的尚可使用年限加实际已使用年限等于全部耐用年限”的算法来计算；如果不适于采用上述的算法，也可以由公私双方协商估算。
    （二）对房屋、其他建筑物和可资利用的铺面装修设备，按照它的新旧程度，参照当地房地产管理机关的估价标准进行估价；如果没有上述价格，由公私双方协商估价。土地也应该进行适当的估价。
    （三）对企业使用的矿藏，不予估价；对开发矿藏可资利用的设备，应予估价。
    （四）对工具、生产经营用的器具，一般按照它的新旧程度，参照国营商业部门的牌价或者市价进行估价；如果没有上述价格，由公私双方协商估价。
    （五）对成品，一般参照国营企业收购价格减去应付税款进行估价；对在制品，一般参照国营企业收购成品价格减去应付税款，再按照完工程度进行适当的估价；如果没有国营企业收购价格，由公私双方协商估价。对质量低劣或者滞销的成品、在制品，参照上述办法酌打折扣进行估价。
    对原材料、机物料等，一般参照国营工业部门的出售价格进行估价；如果原来是向国营商业部门买进的，可以参照国营商业部门的牌价进行估价；如果没有上述价格，由公私双方协商估价。
    对商业企业的商品，一般按照国营商业部门的批发价格进行估价；如果没有该项批发价格，由公私双方协商估价。对质量低劣或者滞销的应该降价出售的商品，由公私双方协商酌打折扣进行估价。
    （六）对企业的呆滞物资，由公私双方协商，酌打折扣，作价入股。
    （七）对企业原有的公积金，一般转为私股股份；如果企业原有一部分公股，应该按原来的公私股份的比例，转作公私双方的股份。如果企业原有的职工集体福利设施较差，可以从公积金中提取适当的部分，作为公私合营企业的职工集体福利基金。
    （八）对原由企业资本项下支出的职工集体福利设备，应该估价作为私股股份；如果企业原有一部分公股，应该按照原来的公私股份的比例，转作公私双方的股份。对原由奖金举办的职工集体福利设备和由企业盈余项下提取的职工福利基金等举办的职工集体福利设备，应该转为公私合营企业所有，不作为私股股份。
    （九）对家、店（厂）不分的企业中，属于生产、经营专用的生产资料，应该清理估价，作为私股股份；属于家庭专用的生活资料，应该归原业主所有。对生产、经营和家庭使用难以划分的财产，例如房屋、家具等，可以由原业主提出意见，在照顾原业主家庭正当需要的原则下协商处理。
    （十）企业实行公私合营的时候，如果需要迁移、合并，应该按照迁移、合并以前的情况，对企业的机器、设备、房屋、土地和其他建筑物，予以估价。迁移、合并的费用，由公私合营企业负担。
    （十一）根据1950年12月政务院财政经济委员会“私营企业重估财产调整资本办法”进行过重估财产的企业，重估结果比较合理的，经公私双方协商，可以作为估价的基础；同时根据资产折旧和其他变动的情况，作适当的调整。
    （十二）在本规定公布以前，已经进行过财产清理估价的公私合营企业，对原来清理估价的结果，不应该变更。
    公私合营企业对私股的待处理财产，应该尽可能加以清理，作价入股。
    （十三）为使私方在公私合营后安心工作和接受改造，对企业原有的债务关系、财产关系和其他有关问题，需要尽可能在财产清理估价的时候清理了结。
