The canal head gate and canal project for diverting water from the Qin River for irrigation, built on the Qin River embankment at Wuchekou in Wuhi County, Henan Province, has recently been completed and has begun to release water for winter irrigation, with good results. This canal is called the "People's Construction Canal" and was built by the Wuzhi Huang (River) Qin (River) Repair and Protection Section of the Henan Provincial Yellow River Bureau.

This water diversion gate can divert five to six cubic meters per second of flow. By utilizing silt deposition, it can transform more than 20,000 mu of sandy land left behind by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek army when they mutually breached the dikes in the autumn of 1943 into fertile fields. It can also turn more than 80,000 mu of dry land in 73 villages around Wuchekou into paddy fields. In the future, the amount of water diverted can be increased to 15 cubic meters per second, further expanding the irrigated area. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    “人民建设渠”完工
    在河南省武陟县五车口沁河堤上兴修的引沁河水灌溉的渠首闸和渠道工程，最近已经完成，并且开始放水冬灌，效果良好。这条渠道叫做“人民建设渠”，是河南省黄河河务局武陟黄（河）沁（河）修防段修建的。
    这座引水闸，可引水五至六秒公方流量，利用放淤，可把日寇和蒋军在1943年秋互相扒堤遗留的2万多亩沙地改变成良田，可以使五车口一带73个村8万多亩旱田变为水田。将来引水量还可增加到15秒公方，进一步扩大灌溉面积。　（据新华社讯）
