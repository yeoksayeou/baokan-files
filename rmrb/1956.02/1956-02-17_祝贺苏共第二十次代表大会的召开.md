The Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has long ceased to be merely an object of interest for Communists and the working-class movement. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the guiding force of a world power. The future political direction of the Soviet state is determined by the resolutions of this Congress. Today, there is no corner of the world that does not pay close attention to every step of the Soviet government and its foreign policy.
