    Use New Production Achievements to Reflect the Superiority of Joint Public-Private Enterprises
    To the Editor:
    Our factory, along with all the private factories in Beijing, was approved for joint public-private ownership in January this year. The good days that private enterprise workers had been looking forward to day and night have finally arrived. We are now the masters of the enterprise! We happily celebrated this great festive day with gongs, drums, and firecrackers, organized shock brigades, and successfully completed the inventory and asset verification work. We are now launching a labor competition. We must use new production achievements to prove that joint public-private enterprises are superior to private enterprises.
    Before the joint public-private ownership, thanks to the education of the Party and the trade union, I realized that the main purpose of workers' production in private enterprises was also to meet the needs of society, create wealth for the country, and accumulate funds; of course, at the same time as production, it was also necessary to supervise the capitalists and educate them to accept socialist transformation. Therefore, I did some preliminary work in this regard. Around this time last year, the private Yixing Smelting Plant accepted a batch of processing tasks from the Beijing Chemical Raw Materials Company, extracting blue lead from waste battery lead sheets. This batch totaled 80 tons, and the manager agreed with the company on a processing fee of 230 yuan per ton. I thought to myself: Wouldn't it reduce the country's processing costs if the furnace was changed to a muffle furnace to improve smelting efficiency? I told the manager about this idea. Unexpectedly, he didn't adopt it, saying, "This is impossible. If production is delayed, can you take responsibility?" He poured cold water on me, but my heart didn't cool down because of it. I ran to the Chemical Raw Materials Company and suggested that they find several more factories to estimate the price, and be sure to reduce the processing fee to avoid the country suffering a loss. Sure enough, the Chemical Raw Materials Company insisted on reducing the processing fee to 115 yuan per ton. The manager had no choice but to adopt my suggestion. Thanks to the support of the workers, everyone actively used their brains and used old materials to build six new muffle furnaces. This has many advantages: in the past, smelting lead was done by setting up a large pot and burning firewood, with four workers watching one furnace, and the furnace temperature was as high as 2,000 degrees Celsius, and the furnace workers were often poisoned by lead fumes; now, muffle furnaces use coke, and workers don't have to stay by the furnace all the time, and two workers can watch five furnaces. Originally, one shift of production can now be changed to three shifts of production. The eight-month task was completed in two and a half months, saving the country more than 9,200 yuan. Because the processing task was completed ahead of schedule, the state gave the factory a bonus of 400 yuan. I have put forward and implemented four such rationalization proposals in production. I did this little bit for the people, and unexpectedly the people gave me such great encouragement. This time I was honorably named a labor model in Beijing. I understand that the little thing I did is just a drop in the ocean compared to the country's socialist construction cause. I must work hard to study under the leadership of the Party, overcome shortcomings, maintain glory, and make greater contributions to the country's construction. After the factory's joint public-private ownership, I guarantee that I will actively participate in the labor competition, study technology, learn advanced experience, improve the output and quality of products, reduce costs, and complete and over fulfill production tasks. I will also strengthen the unity with the workers of our factory and other fraternal factories, care for each other and exchange advanced experience, obey assignments, and continue to supervise the administration to do a good job in production.

### 用新的生产成绩来体现公私合营企业的优越性

    用新的生产成绩来体现公私合营企业的优越性编辑同志：
    我们工厂在今年1月间和北京市所有的私营工厂一起被批准为公私合营了。私营企业职工日日夜夜盼望的好日子终于盼到了。我们现在是企业的主人！我们欢欢喜喜地用锣鼓和鞭炮庆祝了这个大喜的节日，组织了突击队，胜利地完成了清产核资工作，现在正在展开劳动竞赛。我们一定要用新的生产成绩来证明公私合营企业比私营企业优越。
    在公私合营以前，由于党和工会的教育，我认识到在私营企业里工人生产主要的也是为了满足社会的需要，给国家创造财富和积累资金；当然，在生产的同时，还要对资本家进行监督，教育资本家接受社会主义改造。因此，在这方面我初步地做了一些工作。去年这个时候，私营义兴熔炼厂接受北京市化工原料公司的一批加工任务，从废电瓶铅片中提炼青铅。这批活共80吨，经理向公司讲妥：每吨加工费230元。我心里就琢磨：要是把熔炉改成焖炉，提高熔炼效率，岂不是就减少国家一笔加工费用么？我把这个意见对经理说了。想不到他不采纳，说是：“这可是没有门的事，要是误了生产，你负得起责任吗？”他拨冷水，我的心可并没有因此就凉下来。我跑到化工原料公司，建议他们多找几家工厂估价，一定要降低加工费，免得国家吃亏。果然，这一来化工原料公司坚持每吨的加工费降到115元。经理只好采纳我的建议。由于工人们的支持，大家积极动脑筋，就利用旧料砌成了6座新的焖炉。这样一来好处可多着哩：过去熔炼铅是架大锅烧劈柴，4个工人看一炉，炉温高到摄氏2，000度，看炉工人经常被铅毒熏倒；现在用焖炉是烧焦炭，工人不用老守在炉边，两个工人就可以看5个炉。本来一班生产，现在可以改成3班生产。8个月的任务两个半月就完成了，给国家节约了9，200多元。因为提前完成了加工任务，国家给了厂里400元奖金。像这样的生产上的合理化建议，我前后提出并且实现了4项。我给人民办了这点份内的事，想不到人民就给了我这么大的鼓励，这次我光荣地被评为北京市的劳动模范。我懂得我办的这点事，比起国家的社会主义建设事业来，真是大海中的一滴水。我一定要在党的领导下，努力学习，克服缺点，保持光荣，为国家的建设做出更大的贡献。在工厂公私合营以后，我保证要积极地参加劳动竞赛，钻研技术，学习先进经验，提高产品的产量和质量，降低成本，完成和超额完成生产任务。我还要加强同本厂和其他兄弟厂工人的团结，互相关心和互相交流先进经验，服从调动，继续监督行政搞好生产。　北京市公私合营义兴熔炼厂工人　马锡林
