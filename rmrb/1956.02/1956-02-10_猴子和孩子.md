    The Monkey and the Child
    Zhu Bo
    At the Shanghai Railway Station, a passenger named Zhang Zhen was excitedly about to board the train with a monkey he was leading, when a station worker stopped him and said, "Monkeys are not allowed on passenger trains."
    "Comrade, I am the director of the inpatient department of the Northwest Engineering Administration Staff Hospital. This monkey was purchased by our hospital for scientific experiments and is urgently needed," Zhang Zhen replied with confidence.
    "Do you have proof?"
    "Yes," Zhang Zhen said, handing the documents to the other party.
    "This is a certificate for purchasing medicines, it doesn't say anything about buying a monkey."
    "Yes, we went to many places and couldn't buy a monkey, and we didn't expect to be able to buy one in Shanghai, so the certificate didn't mention buying a monkey." He paused and then said, "I'll write you a temporary certificate first, and I'll send you a formal certificate after I return to Xi'an, how about that?"
    The station worker saw that Zhang Zhen did have a certificate for purchasing medicines, and also heard that the monkey was for scientific experiments, so he agreed to let him bring the monkey on the train.
    After returning to Xi'an, Zhang Zhen did not hand the monkey over to the hospital. The hospital did not need to use the monkey for any experiments at all. The monkey was for himself.
    Why did he want to buy a monkey?
    It turned out that Zhang Zhen had his own philosophy of life. He believed that if a person wanted to live comfortably and happily, they had to have "ways." And he was a very "resourceful" person. As long as he wanted to achieve a certain goal, he would do everything possible to do it, no matter what kind of "goal" it was, no matter what kind of "method" it was. He was originally an ordinary pharmacist, but he felt that the pharmacist's position was not high and the salary was not much, so he fabricated his education and deceived his superiors to climb to the position of director of the inpatient department. He originally had a wife, but because he felt tired of living with her, he abandoned her and cohabited with a nurse named Li.
    But he felt that life was still too lonely, he wanted to pursue various new and exciting things, so he came up with the idea of buying a monkey.
    This monkey did bring great changes to his life. He made a small house for the monkey and spent a lot of time teasing it every day. Even during work hours, people often saw him and the monkey playing together in the yard. "Come on, salute!" "Come on, smoke a cigarette!" People who didn't know him might have thought he was a monkey trainer from a circus!
    This matter gradually aroused criticism from the people. But Zhang Zhen didn't care about the opinions of the masses, and he still played with the monkey during work hours.
    However, while Zhang Zhen was raising this monkey, the nurse he was cohabiting with became pregnant.
    After the child was born, he had a cleft lip – what is commonly known as a harelip. Although as a fairly responsible staff member of the hospital, Zhang Zhen should have known that harelip could be treated with plastic surgery. But this "resourceful" person still took a unique "approach" – he decided to abandon the child!
    He found out that there was an orphanage in Xi'an and decided to send the child there. But the orphanage was for orphans. This child had both a mother and a father, so how could he send it in? He frowned and an idea came to him. In the name of the hospital's medical department, he fabricated a letter saying: There was an unnamed woman who gave birth to a child and soon after left the baby and fled on her own. The hospital was unable to raise it, so he requested that the orphanage take it in…
    The child, who was only a few days old, was sent away by him in this way.
    At the same time that he sent away his own child, he discovered that there was also a newborn child in the orphanage who was very likable. So he frowned, and another plan was hatched: he used the name of the hospital to write a letter to the Northwest Engineering Administration, asking the Administration to help him get an orphan from the orphanage to raise. His wish was also successfully achieved.
    However, "fire cannot be contained in paper." Soon, the truth of the matter was discovered by the orphanage. The orphanage severely criticized his deceptive behavior and his illegal act of abandoning his own child, demanding that he return the child.
    Logically speaking, it wouldn't be too late to take back his own child and correct his mistakes at this time. But Zhang Zhen had another plan at this time, called "Of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, running away is the best one." Without even asking for leave, he took the nurse he was cohabiting with and the adopted child and boarded a train back to his hometown in Northeast China.
    But things could not end there. The orphanage insisted that the hospital make Zhang Zhen return the child. Later, after discussions between the two parties, it was decided to give both children to Zhang Zhen to raise, and Zhang Zhen agreed. He requested that the hospital send someone to bring the children to Beijing, and then he would send the children from Beijing to his hometown to raise.
    If he could do this, it would still be acceptable. But unexpectedly, he played another trick and abandoned the child again.
    Where did he send the child? After returning to Xi'an, people investigated the whereabouts of the child, and he had no choice but to admit that he had sent the child to the Shenyang Production and Re-education Institution again.
    According to what he himself said later: At the Shenyang Railway Station, he temporarily gave the child a name – Hu Xiaojing, and wrote a note stating that she was an "illegitimate child" with no one to raise her, and placed it in the child's clothes. He knew that this re-education institution had a life-saving door – a hole, with a wooden board at the entrance, and a bell under the wooden board. As long as the child was placed on the wooden board, the bell would ring and someone would take the child in. So at around 9 o'clock in the evening, he carried the child to the vicinity of the re-education institution, looked around to see if there was anyone nearby, quickly ran over and placed the child on the wooden board at the life-saving door. Then, like a criminal, he sneaked into the shadows, and after the staff on duty at the re-education institution took the child away, he breathed a sigh of relief and hurried away.
    Many people were very surprised and indignant after hearing about this matter. They were surprised that someone could do such a thing. However, such a thing happening to a person whose thinking is thoroughly corrupt is not entirely incomprehensible. Because, in Zhang Zhen's view, children are like monkeys, playthings to accompany him to while away his idle and boring days. Since they are playthings, what's wrong with changing them at will? Don't we often see children throwing away their old, nose-less, ear-less rag dolls and asking their mothers to "buy them a new one"? But what Zhang Zhen casually abandoned were not rag dolls, but people, but the next generation of the motherland!

    猴子和孩子
    朱波
    在上海火车站上，一位叫张镇的旅客牵着一只猴子兴高采烈地要上火车，车站上的一位工作人员把他截住了，说：客车上不能带猴子。
    “同志，我是西北工程管理局职工医院住院处的主任，这是我们医院买去作科学实验用的，急等着用。”张镇理直气壮地回答说。
    “有证明吗？”
    “有。”张镇随说随把证件交给了对方。
    “这是采购药品的证件呀，并没有说要买猴子。”
    “是呀，我们跑了很多地方都没买到猴子，也没有想到能在上海买到，所以证件上就没写买猴子的事。”他停了停，接着说：“我先给你们写个临时证明，等我回西安后再补来正式证件，怎么样？”
    那位车站工作人员看见张镇的确有采购药品的证明，又听说买猴子是作科学实验用的，也就答应他带着猴子上车了。
    回到西安之后，张镇并没有把猴子交给医院。医院也根本不需要用猴子作什么实验。猴子是他给自己买的。
    他为什么要买一只猴子呢？
    原来张镇从来就有他自己的一套人生哲学。他认为一个人要想把生活过得舒舒服服，痛痛快快，就得有“办法”。而他就是一个很有“办法”的人。只要他想达到一个什么目的，就会想尽一切办法去做，不管这是什么样的“目的”，这是什么样的“办法”。他本来是个普通的药剂师，他嫌药剂师的地位不高，薪金不多，于是就捏造学历，欺骗上级，爬上了住院处主任的职位。他本来有一个妻子，因为他感到和她过腻了，就抛弃了她，另外和一位姓李的护士同居起来。
    但是他觉得生活还太寂寞，他要追求各种新奇的刺激，这次他灵机一动就买了一只猴子。
    这只猴子的确给他的生活带来了很大变化。他给猴子做了一间小房子，每天拿出很多时间来逗弄它。即使在工作时间，人们也常见他和猴子一起在院子里玩。“来，敬个礼！”“来，吸根纸烟！”不认识他的人，也许会以为他是马戏团的驯猴师哩！
    这事渐渐地引起了人们的责难了。但是张镇对于群众的意见却满不在意，他仍然在工作时间耍猴子。
    可是，就在张镇喂养这只猴子的时候，和他同居的护士怀孕了。
    孩子生下以后嘴上有个豁儿——就是通常所说的兔儿嘴。虽然作为医院里的一个相当负责的工作人员，张镇应该知道兔儿嘴是可以用整容手术医治的。但是这个有“办法”的人还是采取了一个独出心裁的“办法”——决定把这个孩子抛弃！
    他打听到西安有个育幼院，决定把孩子送到那儿去。可是那个育幼院是收养孤儿的，这个孩子既有母亲，又有父亲，怎么送进去呢？眉头一皱，计上心来，他用医院医务科的名义捏造了一封信，信上说：有一位不知姓名的产妇，在生下小孩后不久，就留下婴儿私自逃走了，医院无力抚养，因此请求育幼院收留……。
    那个生下来才几天的孩子，就这样被他送走了。
    就在送走他亲生的孩子同时，他发现育幼院里有一个也是出生不久的孩子，长的很逗人喜欢。于是他眉头一皱，又是一计：他又用医院名义给西北工程管理局写了一封信，要求管理局帮助他向育幼院要一个孤儿交他抚养。他的这个愿望也顺利地达到了。
    但是，“纸里包不住火”，不久，事情的真相就被育幼院发觉了。育幼院严厉地批评了他的这种欺骗行为和遗弃亲生孩子的违法行为，要求他把孩子换回来。
    按说，在这时候接回亲生的孩子，改正错误也不算迟。可是张镇这时候又生一计，叫作“三十六计，走为上计”。他连假也没有请，就带上同居的护士和收养的孩子，坐上火车回东北的老家了。
    事情却不能就此了结。育幼院坚持要求医院让张镇把孩子换回来。后来，双方商量的结果，决定把两个孩子都交给张镇抚养，张镇也同意了。他要求医院派人把孩子送到北京，他再从北京把孩子送到老家去抚养。
    如果能够这样作，也还说得过去。可是出人意料的是，他又玩弄了一次欺骗手段，又把孩子抛弃了。
    他把孩子送到哪里去了呢？回到西安之后，人们查究这个孩子的下落，他才不得不承认，他把孩子又送到沈阳生产教养院去了。
    据后来他自己说：在沈阳车站上，他临时给孩子起了一个名字——胡小镜，并写了一张纸条，说明她是一个无人抚养的“私生子”，放在孩子的衣服里。他知道这个教养院设有救生门——一个洞洞，洞口有一块木板，木板下面有铃，只要把孩子放到木板上，铃就会响起来，就会有人把孩子接进去。于是他在晚上9点钟左右，抱着孩子来到教养院附近，看了看附近没有人，就迅速地跑过去把孩子放在救生门口的木板上，然后，他就像一个罪犯似的偷偷地溜到黑影里，等到教养院的值班人员把孩子抱走之后，他才松了口气，赶快离开了。
    很多人听到这件事情后感到非常惊讶愤慨。他们惊讶的是竟会有人干出这样的事来。但是，这样的事发生在一个思想腐朽透顶的人身上，也不是完全不可理解的。因为，在张镇看来，孩子也如同猴子一样，是陪伴他消磨无所事事的无聊日子的玩物。既然是玩物，随便换换又有什么不可呢？我们不是常常看到小孩子把玩旧了的缺鼻子缺耳朵的布娃娃一扔，又要妈妈“再给买一个新的”吗？但是张镇随便抛弃的，却不是布娃娃，而是人，而是祖国的下一代啊！
