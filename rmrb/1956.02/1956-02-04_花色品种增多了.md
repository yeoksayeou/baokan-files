    More Varieties and Colors
    By Our Correspondent Shen Wenying
    On Wangfujing Street, the most prosperous area in the capital, there is a "Datong Woolen Knitwear Store" specializing in woolen knitwear. The store's premises are not large, but the various woolen sweaters, hats, gloves, and scarves displayed in the counters are particularly bright, novel, and beautiful.
    Adjacent to the Datong Woolen Knitwear Store are six or seven larger department stores, as well as state-owned department stores. These stores also stock a significant quantity of various woolen knitwear, but why are the goods at Datong Woolen Knitwear Store particularly beautiful and novel? This is because Datong Woolen Knitwear Store used to have some "tricks" to its operations. These "tricks" are: constantly listening to consumer needs, studying changes in consumer needs, and promptly changing the style and color of goods according to consumer demands, to cater to consumer preferences. To achieve this goal, a large portion of the goods sold by Datong Woolen Knitwear Store are purchased or custom-ordered from small private handicraft workshops and machine-knitted sweater factories in Shanghai that have higher technical skills. A small portion is distributed to knitting workers in Beijing with relatively high skills to knit. Because the store has little capital, the quantity of goods purchased is also small. For some new styles of sweaters, only a few pieces are prepared, and the color schemes and styles are changed at any time. Sometimes, when they see an international friend wearing a fashionable sweater, they sketch its pattern and style. Some international friends even actively provide styles and patterns, and commission them to make them. To launch a new style, they often process two or three pieces for trial sales first. During the trial sales process, they listen to and solicit customers' opinions on new varieties, and then process a batch for sale. This method of understanding consumer needs at any time and improving styles promptly gives the goods the characteristics of novelty and beauty. These small handicraft factories are relatively scattered and decentralized, and can only be dealt with by means of small-scale processing or acquisition, which is currently difficult for state-owned commercial departments to manage. Because state-owned commercial departments need to control major sources of goods to lead and stabilize the market, it is still difficult to carry out small-scale processing for scattered small handicraft factories at present. As for general private department stores, because they deal in a wide variety of goods, it is impossible to devote greater effort to studying sweater styles. However, Datong Woolen Knitwear Store specializes in woolen knitwear, which makes it easy to form the operating characteristics of more novel and beautiful goods.
    In September of last year, Datong Woolen Knitwear Store, along with eight other large department stores in Dongdan District, implemented joint state-private ownership, becoming the joint state-private Datong Sales Department of Dongdan District Department Store of Beijing Department Store Company.
    "Transforming private commerce must not reduce the variety of operations, and the characteristics of operations must be maintained," this was repeatedly emphasized by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce and other relevant leading departments when the nine major department stores in Dongdan District implemented joint state-private ownership. However, at that time, the main energy was put into preparing for joint operation, and then into asset inventory and equity determination, improving business management, establishing various procedures, systems, and plans, and not enough attention was paid to increasing the variety of operations and maintaining the characteristics of operations, especially not enough attention was paid to the education of capitalists. The capitalist of Datong Woolen Knitwear Store had concerns during the preparation for joint state-private ownership. At first, he felt that the business could survive for several years even by just sitting back and doing nothing, and he was unwilling to participate in the joint operation. Later, he was willing to participate in the joint operation with the education and assistance of the trade association, but he still held a wait-and-see attitude, and was unwilling to actively purchase goods during the period before the joint operation. At the same time, the state-owned company also controlled part of the supply of goods in order to coordinate and arrange private commerce. In addition, after the nature of the enterprise changed after the joint state-private ownership, the prices of many goods tended to be reasonable, and customers were particularly crowded, and business was better month by month. Especially during the National Day, many female comrades went to buy floral sweaters. Soon after the National Day, the varieties of children's embroidered sweaters, hats, and woolen yarn were greatly reduced, and there were not many women's embroidered sweaters left either. When customers entered the store and saw that there were fewer items on the shelves, they had opinions, saying: Why are there so few goods in the Datong Sales Department, and the things sold are not as novel and beautiful as in the past?
    The customers' opinions aroused the attention of relevant leading departments. Xu Canzhang, the public representative and deputy manager of Dongdan District Department Store, actively and proactively discussed and studied with Ma Diru, the capitalist manager, and Zhang Jian'an, the capitalist deputy director of Datong Sales Department. First, through concrete examples such as the fact that business was getting better month by month after the joint operation, Zhang Jian'an's concerns were dispelled. Through Zhang Jian'an, contact was immediately made with 12 small woolen knitting factories and handicraft workers in Beijing who originally had processing relationships, a meeting was convened with them, and they were given socialist education, explaining that the nature of the enterprise had changed after the joint state-private ownership, and that it was necessary to meet the needs of consumers and serve them better, and to reduce the burden on consumers as much as possible and where necessary. Processing relationships were then established with them, and the new requirements of customers were promptly told to the processing factories, guiding them to improve their production technology. Wang Maoru, the public representative of Datong Sales Department, also proactively discussed and studied with the capitalists, and together they purchased a large number of woolen yarn, sweaters, and scarves from state-owned wholesale stations in Dongdan, Dongsi, and Chongwen to supply the needs of general customers. In order to add more novel varieties, in addition to controlling the source of goods in Beijing, Beijing Department Store Company also invested a portion of funds, and Xu Canzhang, the deputy manager of Dongdan District Department Store, repeatedly studied the operating characteristics with capitalist staff and workers. They pointed out that since the winter of 1954, because the state wanted to uniformly control the source of goods and had a unified procurement system, the source of goods for private stores was mainly purchasing from state-owned companies, and their original contact with small private handicraft factories in Shanghai was cut off. Some children's embroidered sweaters, large-sleeved women's sweaters, and thin brushed sweaters with novel patterns produced in Shanghai were discontinued. However, the processing strength, equipment, and technical level in Beijing are not yet up to par. Many private processing factories in Shanghai have also been organized and incorporated into the track of national planned production. Therefore, to increase new varieties, in addition to guiding Beijing factories to improve processing technology, it is also necessary to find ways to contact the Shanghai State-owned Department Store Purchasing Station and process some new varieties from Shanghai. Therefore, with the help of the Ministry of Commerce, Beijing Department Store Company sent people to Shanghai to make contact and solve the source of goods. Starting in December of last year, most of the new varieties processed in Beijing were shipped in continuously, and the varieties in Datong Sales Department quickly increased from 160 or 170 to nearly 200. In order to supply the needs of the people of the capital during the New Year, more than 1,300 sweaters and 700 pounds of woolen yarn were shipped in successively from December 23rd to 31st. Among these sweaters, there were more than 10 new varieties such as women's floral sweaters with tassels, women's turn-down collar two-color floral coats, men's embroidered pattern floral sweaters, and children's brushed scarves, and the types of woolen yarn also increased. The turnover in December increased by 82.7% compared to August before the joint operation, and by 8.1% compared to November. Many customers felt that the goods in Datong Sales Department had more patterns than before the joint operation. Starting in January of this year, new varieties processed and acquired from small processing factories in Shanghai were also shipped in continuously, which were very popular with customers.
    In order to maintain the characteristics of the operation, Datong Sales Department now fills out a requisition form to the district store every five days to add goods in a timely manner. The district department store also sends a salesman to live in Shanghai, maintaining close contact with the Shanghai Department Store Purchasing Station and Shanghai Department Store Company, promptly reflecting the needs of the people of the capital, putting forward specific opinions for improving products, and meeting consumer demands.
    Now, Datong Sales Department is crowded with customers. In addition to a portion of international friends, most of its customers are staff members of state organs. Customers often leave Datong Sales Department with satisfaction, carrying bags of sweaters or bundles of woolen yarn. Many customers say: Datong Sales Department has more varieties of goods and more reasonable prices than in the past. This is truly the superiority of joint state-private ownership.

    花色品种增多了
    本报记者　沈文英
    在首都最繁荣的王府井大街上，有一家专门经营毛线织品的“大同毛织商店”。这家商店的铺面不算大，但是货柜里陈列的各种毛线衣、毛线帽子、手套、毛围巾等，特别鲜艳、新颖、美丽。
    大同毛织商店的邻近，有六、七家规模较大的百货商店，还有国营百货商店。这些商店里也备有数量不少的各种毛织品，但是为什么大同毛织商店的商品特别美观、新颖呢？这是因为大同毛织商店过去有一些经营的“窍门”。这“窍门”就是：随时听取消费者的需要，研究消费者需要的变化，根据消费者的要求，及时改变商品的式样、花色，来迎合消费者的爱好。为了达到这个目的，大同毛织商店所经营的商品中，有一大部分是从上海一些技术较高的私营小手工业和机器毛衣编织工厂买来或加工定制的。有一小部分是分发给北京市技术比较高的编织工人编织的。因为商店的资金少，进货的数量也少。对一些新式样的毛衣只准备少数几件，并且随时在配色上、式样上调换花样。有时候，他们看到国际友人身上穿着一件时新的毛衣，就把它的花样和式样描画下来。有些国际友人还主动供给式样和花样，向他们定制。要出一种新式样，他们常常先加工两、三件试销。在试销过程中，再听取和征求顾客对新品种的意见，然后再加工一批来卖。这样随时了解消费者的需求、及时改进式样的办法，就使商品具备了新颖、美观的特点。这些小型手工业工厂比较零星、分散，只能采取少量加工或收购的办法，是目前国营商业部门所难以掌握的；因为国营商业部门要掌握主要的大宗的货源来领导和稳定市场，要对零星分散的小型手工业工厂进行零星的少量的加工，现在还有一定的困难。至于一般的私营百货商店，因为经营的品种较多，不可能以较大的力量来研究毛衣的式样。而大同毛织商店专门经营毛织品，就容易形成商品比较新颖美观的经营特点。
    去年9月，大同毛织商店和东单区其他8个大百货商店一起，实行了公私合营，成了北京市百货公司东单区百货商店的公私合营大同门市部。
    “改造私营商业不能减少经营品种，必须保持经营的特点，”这是东单区9大户百货商店实行公私合营的时候，北京市商业局等有关领导部门曾一再强调提出的。但是当时把主要精力放在进行合营的筹备工作上，接着又进行了清产定股、改善经营管理、确立各种手续、制度、计划等工作，对增加经营品种和保持经营特点注意得不够，特别是对资本家的教育注意得不够。大同毛织商店的资本家在筹备公私合营的过程中是有顾虑的，开始他觉得有这家买卖坐吃也能吃几年，不愿参加合营。后来在同业公会的教育和帮助下才愿意合营，但是仍然抱着观望的态度，在合营前的一个时期内，就不愿意积极进货。同时国营公司为了统筹安排私营商业，也控制了一部分货源的供应。再加上公私合营后企业的性质有了改变，很多商品的价格趋于合理，顾客就特别拥挤，买卖一月比一月好。特别在国庆节的时候，女同志去买花毛衣的特别多。在国庆节后不久，童绣花毛衣、帽子和毛线等品种大大减少，女绣花毛衣也余下不多了。顾客一进门看到货架上东西少了，就有意见，都说：怎么大同门市部商品这样少，卖出来的东西不如过去新颖、美观了。
    顾客们的意见，引起了有关领导部门的重视。东单区百货商店的公方代表副经理徐灿章，就积极主动地和资方经理马棣如和大同门市部资方副主任张健安商量研究。先通过合营后买卖一月好一月等具体例子，打破了张健安的顾虑。通过张健安，马上和北京市原来有加工关系的12家小型毛线编织厂和手工业者取得了联系，召集他们开了会，向他们进行了社会主义教育，说明公私合营后企业的性质改变了，既要满足消费者的需求，更好地为消费者服务，又要在可能和必要条件下减轻消费者的负担。随即同他们建立加工关系，并且及时把顾客的新要求告诉给加工厂，指导他们改进生产技术。大同门市部公方代表王茂如又主动和资方共同商量研究，一同到东单、东四、崇文等国营百货批发站购进了大批毛线、毛线衣和围巾，以供应一般顾客的需求。为了更多地增添新颖的品种，除了在北京掌握货源以外，北京市百货公司还投入了一部分资金，东单区百货商店副经理徐灿章又和资方工作人员、职工对经营特点作了反复研究。他们提出从1954年冬季以来，因为国家要统一掌握货源，有了统一的采购制度，私营商店的货源主要是向国营公司进货，他们原来和上海私营小型手工业厂的联系就被切断了。有些上海生产的花样新颖的小孩绣花毛衣、大肥袖女毛衣、薄拉毛衣等就停止了加工。但是目前北京的加工力量、设备和技术水平都还赶不上。上海市的私营加工厂也有很多已经组织起来，纳入国家计划生产的轨道。因此，要增加新品种，除了指导北京工厂改进加工的技术外，还要想法和上海国营百货采购站取得联系，从上海加工一部分新品种。于是，在商业部的帮助下，北京市百货公司派人去上海联系，解决了货源。从去年12月份开始，北京加工的大部分新品种源源运进，大同门市部的品种迅速从一百六、七十种增加到将近200种。为了供应新年首都人民的需要，从12月23日到31日，先后运进了1，300多件毛线衣、700来磅毛线。在这些毛衣中，有带穗的女花毛衣、女翻领双色花外衣、男式绣图案花毛衣、小孩拉毛围巾等10多种新品种，毛线的种类也有增加。12月份的营业额比合营前的8月份增加了82.7％，比11月份增加了8.1％，很多顾客都感到大同门市部的商品比合营前花样更多了。今年1月份开始，从上海小型加工厂加工和收购的新品种也源源运进，很受顾客的欢迎。
    为了保持经营的特点，现在大同门市部每五天向区商店填一次要货单，及时添进商品。区百货商店还派一个业务员住在上海，经常和上海百货采购站、上海市百货公司取得密切联系，及时反映首都人民的需要，提出改进产品的具体意见，满足消费者的需求。
    现在，大同门市部的顾客盈门。它的供应对象中除了一部分国际友人外，大部分是国家机关工作人员。顾客们常常抱着一包包的毛衣或成捆的毛线，满意地走出大同门市部。很多顾客都这样说：大同门市部的东西品种多、价钱比过去合理，这真是公私合营的优越性。
