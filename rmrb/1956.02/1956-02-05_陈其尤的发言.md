    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    Premier Zhou Enlai's political report comprehensively demonstrates that China's peaceful foreign policy has achieved further successes over the past year or so. The overall trend towards easing international tensions is conducive to China's socialist construction. Domestically, the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule this year. The cooperative movement in agriculture and handicrafts, and the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises into joint state-private enterprises have all seen rapid development. The entire situation is "in the midst of a great socialist revolution." The recent proposal of the "National Agricultural Development Program" has further painted a magnificent vision for agricultural development for us. "In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed nationwide." All of this is truly exciting. Please allow me, on behalf of all members of the China Zhi Gong Party, to express our heartfelt support for Premier Zhou's political report and to call on all members and the masses they connect with, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and the great Chairman Mao, to strive with practical actions to accelerate China's socialist construction.
    Vice Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries illustrates the extent to which the criminal activities of counter-revolutionaries in undermining socialist construction have become rampant. Any complacency on our part will lead to incalculable losses. As far as the Zhi Gong Party is concerned, the counter-revolutionaries exposed in this anti-counterrevolutionary movement had committed numerous crimes before liberation and continued their evil destructive acts after liberation. The facts clearly tell us that all counter-revolutionaries must be thoroughly eliminated in order to safeguard the cause of socialism. We fully support this report and are willing to work hard to implement this movement.
    We fully agree with Vice Chairman Li Jishen's report on the work of the Standing Committee, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report on the issue of intellectuals, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and Committee Member Chen Boda's report on the socialist transformation of Chinese agriculture.
    China is a socialist country, and we sincerely hope for a lasting peaceful environment in order to carry out the great cause of socialist construction. However, the American imperialist bloc does not allow us to have such expectations, maintaining and constantly creating tension in the Taiwan region, hindering the progress of the Sino-American ambassadorial talks. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles recently clamored even more wildly about the so-called "brink of war" intimidation and blackmail policy, attempting to make the Chinese people submit, recognize the so-called "two Chinas" created single-handedly by the United States, and allow it to continue to use the Chiang Kai-shek clique for subversive activities. This is something we absolutely cannot allow. I fully support Premier Zhou's statement and call, "We will never allow any third party to interfere in this internal affair of our country," and must "actively prepare to liberate Taiwan by war if necessary, and strive to liberate Taiwan by peaceful means."
    As the whole country is in a high tide of socialist revolution, in order not to let our work lag far behind the objective situation, and in order to involve all our members in this high tide, we must make a hundredfold effort, systematically develop our work, strengthen publicity and contacts with overseas Chinese, report promptly and effectively on the socialist construction of the motherland and the new appearance of the hometowns of overseas Chinese, and deepen the service work for returned overseas Chinese and their families, and expand and consolidate the patriotic united front of overseas Chinese. At the same time, because the strength of our country's existing intellectuals is not enough to meet the requirements of the rapid development of our country's socialist cause, we warmly support the government's plan to vigorously mobilize and train intellectuals to serve the socialist cause of the motherland, and call on intellectuals among the members of the Zhi Gong Party and the senior intellectuals they are connected with to respond to the government's call, intensify the study of Marxism-Leninism, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and the principle of combining theory with practice, actively carry out self-transformation, transform themselves into more useful talents, so as to adapt to the requirements of the objective social situation, and contribute as much as possible their wisdom and ability in the great advance of the motherland's socialist revolution.
    Our country's socialist construction has achieved such brilliant achievements as a result of the continuous, active and creative labor of the people of the whole country under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. At the same time, it is also inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. We wholeheartedly thank the Communist Party of China, thank Chairman Mao, and thank our great ally the Soviet Union and all brotherly countries. We are determined to unite more closely with the people of the whole country, rally more closely around the Communist Party of China, and strive forward for the cause of socialism.

    陈其尤的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    周恩来主席的政治报告集中地表现了：我国一年多来和平外交政策获得了进一步的成就，目前国际局势走向和缓的总趋势，有利于我国的社会主义建设；在国内，发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，将在今年提早完成和超额完成，农业、手工业的合作化运动和私营工商业转为公私合营企业的工作都有突飞猛进的开展，整个形势是“处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中”，最近“全国农业发展纲要”的提出，更给我们画出了农业发展的伟大远景，“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。”这一切，实在令人太兴奋了。请允许我代表中国致公党全体成员对周主席的政治报告表示衷心的拥护，并号召全体成员和所联系的群众，在伟大的中国共产党和伟大的毛主席的领导下，以实际的行动为加速我国的社会主义建设而奋斗。
    董必武副主席关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告，说明了反革命分子破坏社会主义建设的罪恶行为是到了如何猖狂的程度，我们任何麻痹思想都会招致不可估计的损失。以致公党来说，在这一次肃反运动中所揭发的反革命分子都是在解放前罪行累累、解放后仍继续其罪恶的破坏行为的。事实极明显地告诉我们：必须彻底肃清一切反革命分子，然后才能保卫社会主义事业。我们完全拥护这一报告，并愿为贯彻这一运动而努力。
    我们完全同意李济深副主席的常务委员会的工作报告，郭沫若副主席的关于知识分子问题的报告，陈叔通副主席的关于资本主义工商业社会主义改造问题的报告，陈伯达委员的中国农业的社会主义改造的报告。
    我国是社会主义的国家，我们真诚地期望有持久和平的环境，以便于进行社会主义建设伟业。但是美国帝国主义集团却不容许我们有这样的期望，保持和不断制造着台湾地区的紧张局势，阻碍中美大使级会谈的进展，美国国务卿杜勒斯最近更猖狂地叫嚣着所谓“战争边缘”的恐吓和讹诈政策，企图使中国人民屈服，承认美国所一手制造的所谓“两个中国”，并任其继续利用蒋介石集团进行颠覆性的活动，这是我们所绝不能容许的。我完全拥护周主席的声明和号召，“我们决不允许任何第三者来干涉我国这个内部事务”，并须“积极准备在必要的时候用战争方式解放台湾以外，努力争取用和平方式解放台湾。”
    当全国处在社会主义革命的高潮中，为了不使我们的工作远落于客观形势的后面，为了使我们全体成员投入这一高潮，我们必须百倍努力，有规划地展开业务，加强对海外华侨的宣传与联系，及时和有效地报道祖国的社会主义建设情况及侨乡的新面貌，并深入对归侨、侨眷的服务工作，扩大与巩固华侨爱国主义统一战线。同时，由于我国现有知识分子的力量不足以适应我国社会主义事业急速发展的要求，我们热烈拥护政府大力动员与培养知识分子为祖国的社会主义事业服务的规划，并号召致公党成员中的知识分子和所联系的高级知识分子响应政府的号召，加紧学习马克思列宁主义，运用批评与自我批评的武器和理论与实践相结合的原则，积极进行自我改造，把自己改造成为更有用之材，以适应社会客观形势的要求，在祖国社会主义革命事业的大进军中尽量贡献其所有的智慧与能力。
    我国社会主义建设事业有如此辉煌的成就，是全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下不断地进行其积极性与创造性的劳动的结果，同时，也是与苏联和人民民主国家无私的援助分不开的。我们衷心地感谢中国共产党，感谢毛主席，感谢我们伟大的盟邦苏联和所有的兄弟国家。我们有决心与全国人民在一起，更加紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围为社会主义事业而努力前进。
