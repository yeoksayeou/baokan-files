    On Promoting Putonghua
    Wang Li, Director of the Chinese Language Teaching and Research Group, Peking University
    The State Council has issued instructions on promoting Putonghua. We support these instructions and will assist the government in vigorously promoting Putonghua.

    Putonghua is the language universally spoken by all the people. Specifically, it is the common language of the Han nationality based on the Northern dialect and with Beijing pronunciation as its standard.

    The national common language of the Han nationality has already taken shape. This does not mean that Chinese has no dialectal variations; on the contrary, the serious divergence of dialects hinders the full development of the role of the national common language. From the general trend of historical development, Chinese will surely achieve complete unification on the basis of the Northern dialect, and Chinese dialects will eventually be worn away by the national common language. The question is: Are we going to let things take their own course, or are we going to give play to the subjective initiative of the whole people, accelerate the development of Chinese, and give full play to the role of the national common language, thereby benefiting the great cause of socialist construction? I think we should choose the latter.

    Language and people's lives are inseparable; language is a part of life. In Stalin's words, language is a tool for communication and the exchange of ideas, a weapon of struggle, and it can adjust people's joint work in the production process. However, people are generally not aware of the enormous role of language in revolutionary work and production activities. The losses caused by language barriers are almost understood as irresistible natural disasters. If production is delayed and business is messed up because of language barriers, it is as if a meteor has fallen from the sky and crushed someone, and a sigh is all that is left. If you can't understand what is being said in a big report, you just say "What a pity." Many local cadres regularly make reports to the people, but few people pay attention to improving their local accents. Not being good at using language often leads to great losses in propaganda work.

    Many people work and study in dialect areas, and they do not feel the need for Putonghua. This idea is lagging behind the development of the situation. The people of the new China want to participate in political, economic, cultural, and other activities, and their scope of activities has expanded. The entire motherland should be regarded as a big family. Today, it is easier for us to go to the border areas of our motherland to work than it was for our grandfathers to go to the county town to buy a chicken. According to the needs of the state, local people do not necessarily work locally. They may be sent to other provinces or border areas one day, and we cannot bring our local accents with us unchanged. Moreover, the state has implemented a conscription system, and every young person of the right age has the opportunity to enlist in the army and may be on the front lines of national defense in the future, while comrades in the same company, platoon, and squad may not be from the same hometown. In short, the idea that learning Putonghua will not be useful in the future is wrong.

    Promoting Putonghua does not mean eliminating dialects. What I said earlier about dialects eventually being worn away by the national common language is likely to happen only one or two hundred years from now, and even those who love dialects need not worry. At present, our requirement is that every member of the Han nationality (first and foremost children and young people) should be able to speak a second language in addition to their native language, namely Putonghua. The degree to which they can speak it depends on the specific situation. Broadcasters and film and drama actors should be required to be the most proficient, followed by primary school teachers and cultural instructors in the army, followed by primary school students, followed by soldiers, followed by government cadres, followed by farmers, and so on. There is no coercion here, only appeals, but this is a serious appeal from the government, and we should treat it as a political task to be accomplished.

    In addition to its inherent political value, the promotion of Putonghua also creates conditions for the fundamental reform of Chinese characters. As everyone knows, the fundamental reform of Chinese characters is to follow the common phonetic direction of world writing systems. Language inconsistency is a major obstacle to the implementation of phonetic writing. Of course, I am not saying that Chinese characters can only be phoneticized when dialects no longer exist. I am only saying that when the vast majority of people can understand Putonghua and speak it reasonably well, we should make this period come sooner. After the implementation of phonetic writing, literacy work will be smoother, and even the length of primary and secondary school education will be shortened as a result. This also shows that the promotion of Putonghua is greatly beneficial to the construction of the motherland.

    But there are also some skeptics who think that the so-called "National Language Movement" of the Kuomintang era did not achieve much after more than 30 years, and that the current work of promoting Putonghua will probably not achieve much either. This is not looking at the problem in essence. Since liberation, the People's Government has done many things that the reactionary Kuomintang government could never do! The new China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China is not only incomparable to the corrupt Kuomintang regime, but also incomparable to the "peaceful and prosperous times" of the past dynasties. Chairman Mao said: "We are doing a most glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done." For the sake of the construction of the motherland, we can make high mountains bow their heads and the Yellow River clear. Why can't we unify the language?

    The promotion of Putonghua will surely succeed because of the leadership of the Party and the active support of the people of the whole country. The voice of Beijing represents the voice of China, and we must make everyone love to hear this voice. We predict that in a not-too-distant future, the people of the whole country will be able to listen to Premier Zhou Enlai's political reports through the Central People's Broadcasting Station without translation, and with great enthusiasm.

### 论推广普通话

    论推广普通话
    北京大学汉语教研组主任  王力
    国务院发出了推广普通话的指示。我们拥护这一个指示，我们要协助政府，大力推广普通话。
    普通话就是在全民中普遍通行的话。具体地说，它是以北方话为基础方言、以北京语音为标准音的汉民族共同语。
    汉民族的民族共同语已经形成了，这不是说汉语已经没有方言的存在，相反地，方言的严重分歧妨碍着民族共同语的作用的充分发挥。就历史发展的总趋势来看，将来汉语一定会在北方话的基础上达到完全统一，汉语方言最后也一定被民族共同语消磨掉。问题在于：我们是听任自流呢，还是发挥全民的主观能动性，加速汉语的发展，使民族共同语的作用充分发挥，从而有利于伟大的社会主义建设呢？我想我们应该选择后者。
    语言和人们的生活是分不开的，语言是生活的一部分。用斯大林的话来说，语言是交际和交流思想的工具，是斗争的武器，它能够调整人们在生产过程中的共同工作。但是一般人不大意识到语言对革命工作和对生产活动的巨大作用。对语言不通所引起的损失，几乎是了解为不可抗拒的自然灾害。由于语言的隔阂，把生产耽误了，把业务弄糟了，竟好像天上掉下来的一颗流星压坏了人，叹一口气就算了事。听大报告听不懂话，也只叫一声“可惜”。许多地方干部经常对人民群众做报告，却很少人注意改善自己的南腔北调。不善于运用语言，常常招致宣传工作上的很大损失。
    许多人在方言地区工作和学习，他们不感觉到需要普通话。这种思想是落后于形势的发展的。新中国的人民要参与政治、经济、文化等各方面的活动，他们的活动范围扩大了。整个祖国应该看做一个大家庭。今天我们要到祖国的边疆去工作，比较我们的祖父要到县城里去买一只鸡还方便些。根据国家的需要，本地人不一定在本地工作，说不定有一天被派遣到外省或边疆，我们总不能把我们的乡音原封不动地带了去。再说，国家已经实行征兵制，每一个适龄的青年都有应征入伍的机会，将来可能在国防的最前线，而同营、同连、同排的战友却不一定是同乡。总之，怕学会了普通话将来用不着，这种思想是错误的。
    推广普通话并不意味着消灭方言。我在前面所说的方言最后会被民族共同语消磨掉，那最早该是一二百年以后的事，连那些爱护方言的人也用不着发愁。目前我们的要求只是汉族每一个人（首先是儿童和青年）除了他的家乡话之外还会说第二种话，就是普通话。会说到什么程度，还要看具体情况。对广播员和电影、话剧的演员应该要求最严，其次是小学教师和部队里的文化教员，其次是小学生，其次是战士们，其次是机关干部，其次是农民，等等。这里没有强迫命令，只有号召，然而这是政府严肃的号召，我们应该当做政治任务来完成。
    推广普通话的工作，除了本身的政治价值之外，它还为汉字的根本改革创造条件。大家知道，汉字的根本改革就是要走世界文字共同的拼音方向。语言不统一，是实行拼音文字的一大阻碍。当然我不是说要等到方言不存在的时候汉字才能实行拼音化，我只是说等到广大群众对于普通话能听得懂和说得大致不差的时候，而这个时期我们应该使它早日到来。文字实行了拼音之后，扫盲工作将更加顺利，甚至中小学教育的年限也会因此缩短。在这一点上也同样显示着普通话的推广是大大地有利于祖国的建设事业的。
    但是还有一些怀疑论者，他们以为国民党时代的所谓“国语运动”搞了30多年，也没有搞出什么名堂来，现在推广普通话的工作恐怕也不会有什么成绩。这是不能从本质上看问题。解放以来，国民党反动政府一向做不到的事，人民政府不知做了多少！中国共产党领导下的新中国，不但是腐败的国民党政权所不能比的，而且也是历代的“太平盛世”所不能比的。毛主席说：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。为了祖国的建设，我们能使高山低头，黄河澄清，为什么不能使语言统一呢？
    推广普通话一定获得成功，因为有党的领导和全国人民的积极拥护。北京的声音代表着中国的声音，我们要做到人人爱听这个声音。我们预祝在一个不很长的时间内，全国人民都能通过中央人民广播电台，不经翻译，眉飞色舞地听取周恩来总理的政治报告。
