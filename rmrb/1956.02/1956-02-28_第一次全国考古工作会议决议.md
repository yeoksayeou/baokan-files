The National Archaeological Work Conference, jointly convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, was held in Beijing from February 21 to 27, 1956. The conference was attended by 180 people, including archaeological workers and cultural relics workers from Beijing and 21 provinces and cities, historical researchers, and archaeology teachers from universities. At the meeting, reports on archaeological work were delivered by Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Zheng Zhenduo, Deputy Minister of Culture, respectively. Twenty-six special reports on archaeological excavations were read, and work experiences were exchanged, leading to a clear understanding of future tasks and directions. Everyone unanimously agreed that the convening of this conference was timely and would actively promote the comprehensive development of archaeological work.

Since the founding of the country six years ago, China's archaeological and cultural relics work has developed unprecedentedly and achieved great successes under the leadership and care of the Party and the government. However, due to the small number of professional archaeological workers and their low scientific level, our work still lags far behind actual needs and cannot keep up with the development of socialist construction. In order to make archaeological work more, faster, better, and more economical, we must tap potential strengths, vigorously train cadres, master advanced scientific methods, improve professional standards, and strengthen cultural relics protection and survey work. We suggest that the Academy of Sciences and relevant departments, in accordance with the principle of "overall planning, strengthening leadership," formulate a comprehensive plan for archaeological work, make unified and specific arrangements for the above items, and stipulate the steps to be taken to ensure that Chinese archaeology approaches and catches up with the international advanced level within a certain period of time, and solves the urgent problems in historical research.

The socialist construction of the motherland is developing rapidly, and large-scale basic construction is being carried out throughout the country. Protecting cultural relics is a very important issue at present. We suggest that the Ministry of Culture formulate comprehensive regulations on the protection of cultural relics such as ancient tombs and ancient sites, as well as specific protection and management measures such as general surveys and registration, and the issuance of licenses. We hope that our archaeological workers and staff in other positions will actively publicize the importance and methods of protecting cultural relics, give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of the people in cherishing local cultural relics, and assist the government in doing a good job in cultural relics protection.

Basic construction such as national factories and mines, railways, highways, and farmland water conservancy are all under construction. The comprehensive plan for the harnessing and utilization of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and various water systems is being carried out step by step. The large-scale opening of the "underground museum" has opened up broad prospects for archaeological work. Archaeological workers across the country must closely cooperate with the relevant departments of basic construction and do a good job in the protection of cultural heritage under the principle of both benefiting the progress of the project and benefiting the protection of cultural relics. We hope that engineering personnel in various departments will give us more help and support in the design and construction process.

The conference called on archaeological workers across the country to actively study Marxism-Leninism theory, criticize bourgeois idealist ideology, carry out criticism and self-criticism, strengthen unity, correct academic style, master advanced technologies and methods, and improve ideological awareness and professional abilities, in order to strive for archaeology to approach and catch up with the world's advanced level within 12 years.

In order to further learn advanced experience and methods, improve the scientific level of archaeological work, and more widely exchange work experience, the conference decided to hold an archaeological academic conference in 1957.

We firmly believe that, after this conference, the national archaeological workers will be more closely united around the Party, and under the guidance of the Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Culture, make use of all favorable conditions, give full play to work enthusiasm and creativity, and do a good job in archaeological work; make contributions to academic research work and to popularizing patriotic education among the people. We will certainly use our actions to welcome the high tide of the motherland's cultural construction and complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the government.

    第一次全国考古工作会议决议
    中国科学院和中华人民共和国文化部联合召开的全国考古工作会议，于1956年2月21日至27日在北京举行。参加会议的有北京和21个省市的考古工作者、文物工作者，历史研究人员和大学的考古学教师，共180人。会议上分别听取了中国科学院郭沫若院长和文化部郑振铎副部长所作的关于考古工作的报告，宣读了考古发掘专题报告26篇，交流了工作经验，对今后的任务和努力方向，有了明确认识。大家一致认为这次会议的召开，是适时的，对考古工作的全面开展是有积极推动作用的。
    建国六年以来我国的考古文物工作在党和政府的领导关怀下，有了空前的发展，取得了巨大的成绩。但是，由于专业的考古工作者的队伍较小，科学水平不高，我们的工作还远远地落后于实际需要，赶不上社会主义建设事业的发展。为了把考古工作做到又多又快又好又省，我们必须发掘潜在力量，大力培养干部，掌握先进科学方法，提高业务水平，加强文物保护和普查工作。我们建议科学院和有关部门，按照“全面规划、加强领导”的方针，制定出有关考古工作的全面规划，对上述各项，作出统一的具体安排，规定进行步骤，来保证我国考古学在一定时间内，接近和赶上国际先进水平；解决历史研究上的迫切问题。
    祖国的社会主义建设事业正在一日千里的发展，大规模基本建设在全国进行，保护文物是目前一个十分重要的问题。我们建议：文化部制定出有关古墓葬、古遗址等全面的文物保护条例，以及普查登记，发执照等具体的保护管理办法。希望我们考古工作者和其他岗位上的工作人员，积极宣传保护文物的重要意义和方法，发挥广大人民所素有的爱护乡土文物的热情和积极性，协助政府共同做好文物保护工作。
    全国厂矿、铁路、公路、农田水利等基本建设都在动土施工，黄河长江及各水系根治利用的综合规划，正在有步骤的进行，“地下博物馆”的大量开放，给考古工作开辟了广阔前途。全国考古工作人员要与基本建设的有关部门，紧密合作，在既利于工程进行，又利于文物保护的原则下，把文化遗产保护工作做好。希望各部门的工程人员在设计、施工过程中，给我们以更多的帮助和支持。
    会议号召全国考古工作人员，要积极的学习马克思、列宁主义理论，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，开展批评与自我批评，加强团结，端正学风，掌握先进技术和方法，提高思想觉悟和业务能力，为争取考古学在12年内接近和赶上世界先进水平而努力。
    为了进一步学习先进经验和方法提高考古工作的科学水平，更广泛的交流工作经验，大会决定于1957年召开一次考古学术会议。
    我们深深相信，全国考古工作者，经过这次会议，将更加紧密的团结在党的周围，在科学院和文化部的指导下，利用一切有利条件，发挥工作积极性和创造性，做好考古工作；在学术研究工作上、在对人民群众普及爱国主义教育上作出贡献。我们一定用自己的行动来迎接祖国文化建设的高潮，完成党和政府交给我们的光荣任务。
