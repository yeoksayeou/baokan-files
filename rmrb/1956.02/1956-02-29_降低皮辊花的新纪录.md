    New Record for Reducing Roller Lapping
    Wang Xiulan, a female spinner at the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill, has set a new record for reducing roller lapping. From February 22nd to the present, she has produced only 0.03 to 0.04 pounds of roller lapping per 100 pounds of yarn spun. This is even lower than the achievement made by Pu Yuzhen, a female spinner at the state-owned Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, in early February (0.062 pounds of roller lapping per 100 pounds of yarn spun).

    降低皮辊花的新纪录
    国营上海第一棉纺织厂细纱女工王秀兰，创造了降低皮辊花的新纪录。从2月22日到现在，她所纺的每百磅纱，只出0.03到0.04磅皮辊花，比国营上海第十七棉纺织厂的细纱女工浦玉珍在2月初所创造的成绩（纺每百磅纱出0.062磅皮辊花）还要低。
