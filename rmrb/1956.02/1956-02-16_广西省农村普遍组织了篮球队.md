    Basketball Teams Universally Organized in Rural Guangxi Province
    Guangxi Province has basically organized basketball teams in every township, and there are already more than 10,000 basketball courts in the rural areas of the province. These basketball teams are mostly organized or led by the Communist Youth League and clubs within agricultural production cooperatives.
    Now, after work in the production teams of agricultural production cooperatives throughout Guangxi, young men and women of all ethnic groups often practice playing basketball on the village basketball courts. During festivals, the youth also gather in larger towns to hold basketball competitions, organized by district or several townships. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广西省农村普遍组织了篮球队
    广西省基本上乡乡都组织了篮球队，全省农村已经有篮球场1万多个。这些篮球队大都是由农业生产合作社中的青年团和俱乐部组织或领导的。
    现在广西各地农业生产合作社的生产队收工以后，各族男、女青年就经常在村里的篮球场上练习打篮球。每逢节日，青年们还以区或几个乡为单位，集中在较大的城镇举行篮球比赛。　（新华社）
