    Hurry Up and Determine the Retail Prices of New-Style Farm Tools
    To the Editor:
        The intense spring plowing season is about to begin. Millions upon millions of members of agricultural production cooperatives across the country are preparing to use the new-style farm tools manufactured for them by their worker brothers, to ensure the realization of agricultural production increase plans. However, up to now, the retail prices of farm tools have not been determined, and a large number of farm tools that have been transferred to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives cannot yet be sold to farmers.
        Why haven't the retail prices of new farm tools been determined? The reason is that the ex-factory prices of farm tools have not yet been determined. In fact, as early as last year, in the joint notice on reducing farm tool prices issued by seven central departments, and in the notice issued by the Third Ministry of Machine Building to provincial industrial departments on implementing farm tool price reductions, clear principle provisions were made for the ex-factory prices of farm tools: namely, retail price minus circulation costs equals ex-factory price. In early January of this year, the State Planning Commission also convened a meeting with the Third Ministry of Machine Building and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, disclosed factory costs and supply and marketing system circulation costs, and, combined with the pricing principles mentioned above, initially proposed opinions on the ex-factory prices of new-style farm tools for this year. Later, after research by relevant leading departments, the circulation costs of the supply and marketing departments were further reduced by 0.32%, and an initial ex-factory price was determined. However, this price has not yet been finalized. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are eagerly waiting for the leading organs to quickly determine and notify them of the retail prices of new-style farm tools. Some have even sent telegrams and official documents several times to the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to urge them. If this problem is not resolved quickly, it will not only affect agricultural production, but also prevent industrial and commercial departments from timely turnover of funds.
        Agricultural time cannot be delayed. It is hoped that the competent authorities will quickly and effectively solve this problem.

### 赶快确定新式农具的零售价格

    赶快确定新式农具的零售价格编辑同志：
    紧张的春耕生产即将开始，全国千千万万的农业生产合作社的社员们，都准备采用工人兄弟为他们赶制的新式农具进行生产，以保证农业增产计划的实现。但是，直到目前为止，农具的零售价格没有确定，大批已经调到基层供销社的农具，还不能出售给农民。
    为什么不确定新农具的零售价格呢？原因是农具的出厂价格还没有确定。实际上，早在去年中央七个部门发出的有关农具降价的联合通知中，以及第三机械工业部对各省工业厅贯彻农具降价的通知中，对农具出厂价格都已经作了明确的原则规定：即零售价格减流转费等于出厂价格。今年1月上旬，国家计划委员会还召集第三机械工业部和全国供销合作总社开会，公开了工厂成本和供销系统的流转费用，并且结合上面提到的作价原则，初步提出了今年新式农具出厂价格的意见。后来，经过有关领导部门研究，又核减了供销部门0.32％的流转费，初步确定了一个出厂价。但是，这个价格到现在还没有确定下来。各地供销合作社都眼巴巴地等着领导机关赶快把新式农具的零售价格确定以后通知他们，有的还几次用电报公文来向全国供销合作总社催问。这个问题如果不很快解决，不但要影响农业生产，而且也使工业部门和商业部门的资金不能及时周转。
    农时是不能耽误的，希望主管部门迅速有效地解决这个问题。
