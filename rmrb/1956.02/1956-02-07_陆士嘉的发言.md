    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I felt extremely excited after hearing and studying Premier Zhou's "Political Report" and other reports. Since liberation, the motherland has been advancing rapidly, and the current nationwide socialist revolution is leaping forward at an unprecedented speed. Facing the new situation, we intellectuals are also eager to catch up with the high tide. At this moment, the Party has raised the issue of intellectuals, calling on everyone to march toward science and strive to approach international levels within 12 years. We greatly welcome this wise decision and are determined to do everything possible to win victories on the scientific battlefield.
    As a female technical science worker, I feel deeply moved to be able to accept such a glorious and great task together with everyone today, in addition to being very excited. Recalling the pre-liberation era, women were subject to feudal oppression everywhere, and few were able to receive higher education. The very few female senior intellectuals who sought work in society were also subjected to much scorn. Many universities established some unreasonable rules in order to refuse women from participating in work. For example, husband and wife could not teach in the same school, or even if they were in the same school, they did not receive equal pay for equal work, with men receiving full pay and women receiving half pay, and so on. Women did not receive care from society and family and could not unleash their potential. Therefore, Chinese women today have actually gained double liberation. Looking at the opportunity for education, taking engineering, which was considered the least suitable subject for women in the past, as an example, as far as I know, before liberation, female students studying engineering in universities only accounted for one or two percent of the total number of students, while now the number of female students in some higher industrial schools has exceeded 20% of the total number of students, and there are even more female students studying medicine. The number of female scientific workers working in the Academy of Sciences, universities, and technical departments is also increasing day by day. After liberation, under the care and education of the Party, our political awareness has been continuously improved. In the ranks marching toward science, although we are small in number, we will definitely be able to fight tenaciously alongside our male comrades.
    The most important thing in marching toward science is to unify the thinking of the entire army. We should unify under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, study hard, transform ourselves, and carry out our work. The view that politics cannot lead professional work is wrong and should be criticized. I myself used to be a person with a purely technical viewpoint. After liberation, through political study, and more importantly through many social works, I realized that politics and professional work cannot only not be separated, but politics guides professional work. Without the unified leadership of the Party, without the unification of ideological understanding, we could not have a correct direction today, nor could we comprehensively organize manpower and formulate comprehensive plans. Among us intellectuals, the vast majority have realized the role of the collective. However, as Vice Chairman Guo Moruo said, intellectuals, more or less, are accustomed to working alone, indulging in self-admiration, being narrow-minded, emphasizing the importance of their own work, and looking down on the work of others. The Party should strengthen education and help us understand that to march toward science, we cannot adopt a guerrilla warfare approach, but need regular troops, need commanders, because only in this way can we more quickly strengthen our strength and conquer scientific fortresses.
    What we welcome is that in order to work better, the Party and the government are giving us strong support and creating favorable conditions. I would like to raise three points here for the leadership to pay attention to:
    (1) According to the decisions of the Party and the government, we will have at least six-fifths of our working days in the future, that is, a 40-hour work week. I would like to mention here the other 8 hours of other time. Based on past experience, if there are more than a dozen places that each want to occupy "only" 1 hour during these 8 hours, it can quickly lead to overtime. Adding one or two hours of "other time" to the professional time every day actually affects work. Because the human brain is different from traffic lights and cannot turn at right angles quickly, and scientific research must be able to concentrate thinking. Therefore, I suggest that in order to ensure the 40 hours per week, a proper arrangement should be made for the other 8 hours. For example, stipulate that there is one full day a week that is a non-business day or that there are two fixed afternoons a week that are non-business hours, and the rest is full-time work.
    (2) To cultivate young cadres to catch up with international standards, we must also pay attention to the improvement and connection of the levels of schools at all levels. Otherwise, the new force of scientific research—college students and graduate students—will have to make up lessons when they start working, which will affect the speed and quality of the advance.
    (3) Currently, there is a great lack of research materials. In research work, not knowing the current situation at home and abroad will lead to great detours. At the same time, the results of research cannot be exchanged and promoted to relevant departments in a timely manner, which reduces or even negates the effect of research work on national construction. Therefore, on the one hand, we must quickly enrich the information, and on the other hand, we must also establish an information network for research information, which should include researchers and factory and mine workers.
    As many comrades have said, our current task is arduous, difficult, but also completely has the conditions to overcome. We must establish a materialistic world view and a communist outlook on life, and after the government's overall plan is determined, we must act quickly and strive to build the cause of socialism!

    陆士嘉的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    听到并学习了周总理的“政治报告”及其他报告，感到无比的兴奋。解放后祖国在迅速地前进着，而目前全国的社会主义革命高潮，更以空前的速度向前飞跃。我们知识分子，面对着新形势，也迫切要求赶上高潮。党在这时候提出了知识分子问题，号召大家向科学大进军，要在12年内接近国际水平，我们非常欢迎这个英明决定，并决心尽一切力量，在科学的战场上获得胜利。
    作为一个女技术科学工作者，今天能同大家一起接受这样一个光荣而伟大的任务，除了非常兴奋外，感触很大。回想解放前，妇女到处受封建压迫，很少人能受到高等教育，其中极少数的女高级知识分子到社会中找工作，也是饱受白眼。不少大学里为了拒绝妇女参加工作，立了些不合理的戒条。例如：夫妇不能在一个学校教书，或是虽在一个学校，不同工同酬，男的全薪，女的半薪等等。妇女得不到社会及家庭的照顾，不能发挥潜力。所以现在的中国妇女，实际上得了双重解放。试由受教育机会来看，以过去大家认为妇女最不宜学的工科而论，就我所知，解放前在大学学工科的女生，只占全校学生人数百分之一、二，而现在有的高等工业学校中女生数目已超过学生总数的20％，学医的女生更多。在科学院、高等学校及技术部门工作的女科学工作者的数字也日益增多。解放后，在党的关怀与教育下，我们的政治觉悟不断提高。在向科学进军的队伍里，我们人数虽少，但一定能顽强地与男同志并肩作战。
    向科学进军，最主要的是统一全军思想。我们应当统一在马克思列宁主义的思想指导下，努力学习，改造自己，进行工作。政治不能领导业务的看法是错误的，应当批判的。我自己以前也是个单纯技术观点的人，解放后通过政治学习，更重要的是通过了许多社会工作，体会到政治与业务不但不能分开，而且是指导业务的。如果没有党的统一领导，没有思想认识的统一，我们今天就不可能有正确的方向，也不可能全面地组织人力，制定全面计划。在我们知识分子中，绝大多数都体会到集体的作用。但是，正如郭沫若副主席所说的，知识分子或多或少的都习惯于单干，孤芳自赏，坐井观天，强调他自己所作的东西的重要性，看不起旁人的东西。党应当加强教育与帮助我们了解，要向科学进军，不能采取游击战的方式，需要正规军，需要统帅，因为只有这样才能更迅速的加强实力，攻克科学堡垒。
    值得我们欢迎的是：为了更好的工作，党和政府正给我们以大力支持并创造有利条件。我这里只想提出三点请领导加以注意：
    （1）根据党及政府的决定，以后我们至少有六分之五的工作日，即每周40小时工作日。我现在想提一下那另外8小时的其他时间。根据过去经验，如果有十几处每处都想在这8小时内“只”占1小时，则很快就能造成超时。每天在专业时间内都夹上这么一二小时的“其他时间”，事实上也影响了工作。因为人的脑子与红绿灯不同，不能很快的转直角，而作科学研究一定要能思想集中。所以我建议为了保证每周的40小时，要给那另外的8小时作个妥善安排。例如：定出每周有一整天是非业务日或每周有两个固定的下午是非业务时间，其余都是全天工作。
    （2）要培养年青干部赶上国际水平，还要注意到各级学校程度的提高及衔接的问题。否则科学研究的新生力量——大学生及研究生——在开始工作时还要补课，这就影响了进军的速度及质量。
    （3）目前研究工作的资料十分缺乏。在研究工作中，不知道国内外的现况，会走很大弯路。同时，研究出来的成果不能及时交流，推广到有关部门中去，也使研究工作对于国家建设所起的效果降低或甚至不起作用。所以一方面要迅速充实资料，另一方面也要建立研究资料的情报工作网，其中应包括研究人员及厂矿工作人员。
    正如许多同志所说的，我们目前的任务是艰巨的，有困难的，但也完全有条件去克服。我们要建立唯物主义世界观与共产主义的人生观，在政府全面规划确定后，迅速的行动起来，为建设社会主义事业而奋斗！
