Dao Dongting's Speech

    Chairman, esteemed committee members:
    I fully agree with and support the reports made by the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen. Now, please allow me to talk about my past sins here.
    I am from the ethnic upper class, a hereditary Tusi (chieftain) passed down through generations, and I am already the 30-something generation. In the past, I ruled, oppressed, and exploited the people, and I also suffered from the rule, oppression, and deception of the reactionary ruling classes throughout the generations, especially the Kuomintang reactionaries. At the beginning of liberation in my hometown, I held doubts, concerns, and fears about the Party and the people, and left the motherland for Burma. At that time, when I went to Burma, I originally intended to avoid things, do some business, and listen to the Party's policies. If the Party's policy towards the ethnic upper class was lenient, I would return to the country; otherwise, I would stay in Burma. However, after I arrived in Burma, I was not only subjected to the Kuomintang remnant bandits' propaganda, which distorted the facts and deepened my doubts and concerns, but I was also exploited by the Kuomintang remnant bandits through intimidation and enticement. At that time, the remnant bandits said: "You must join us so that we can protect you. If you don't join us, the Communists will come in the future and deal with you, and the Burmese army will also deal with you. So, we might as well deal with you first." Under such circumstances, I became a pawn of the Kuomintang remnant bandits, doing things that betrayed the motherland. The above is a summary of my sins.
    Since liberation, the Party and the people of the motherland have spared no effort to send people to send me letters and propaganda materials in order to save me from the dark mire, all to enable me to continuously and correctly understand the Party's policies, and to let me know the brilliant achievements made by the motherland on various production and construction fronts under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. These things constantly educated me and encouraged me to establish a firm confidence in breaking away from the remnant bandits and returning to the motherland. Therefore, I broke away from the remnant bandits and returned to the embrace of the motherland. When I first returned to the motherland, although I personally received the Party and government's lenient treatment and meticulous care, I had not completely eliminated my concerns. Later, after visiting Kunming and receiving personal education from the provincial Party and government leaders, I correctly realized that the Party's policy towards the ethnic upper class was based on long-term unity, education, and transformation. Only then did I believe that the Party and government's leniency towards me was genuine and would never change. Facts have shown that the Party and the people are not only lenient towards me, not pursuing my past sins, but also elected me as a representative to the Yunnan Provincial People's Congress, and made me the vice-chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Ethnic Affairs Committee and a leading cadre of the autonomous prefecture. This time, I have also been able to participate in the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. These facts have educated me, making me further realize the greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, and educating me that to live like a human being, I can only closely follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and only by following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can I have a bright and happy life.
    Our hometown is on the frontier of national defense, and there are still remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on the border, and there are many of our people who have been deceived abroad. Therefore, we must do a good job in various tasks to defend the border, and at the same time, strive to bring our people who are abroad back to the embrace of the motherland.
    Now, our Xishuangbanna is carrying out land reform through peaceful consultation. I believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, after the land reform through peaceful consultation, the exploitation system will be basically eliminated, laying the foundation for the socialist transformation in the countryside.
    After I go back, I will devote all my efforts to this work, and work with the people in my area to do this work faster and better, and strive to basically complete this task by the end of this year.

    刀栋庭的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护主席及各位副主席所作的报告。现在请允许我在这里谈一谈我的过去罪恶。
    我是民族上层、历代传统的世袭土司，到我本身已经是30几代了。在过去自己统治、压迫和剥削过人民，也遭受到历代反动统治阶级，特别是国民党反动派的统治、欺压和蒙蔽。在我乡解放之初，我抱着对党对人民的怀疑、顾虑与畏惧，离开了祖国到缅甸去。当时我到缅甸去，本想是去避一避，做做买卖，听听党的政策，如果党对民族上层的政策是宽大就回国，不然就在缅甸住下。可是我到了缅甸之后，不但受到国民党残余匪徒歪曲事实的宣传，加深了怀疑与顾虑，而且被国民党残余匪徒以威吓、利诱的手段利用了，当时残匪说：“你要参加我们，我们才保护你，如果你不参加我们，将来共产党来了，要来解决你，缅甸军队来了也要解决你，那么不如我们先就把你解决掉。”我就在这样的情形下做了国民党残匪的走卒，做着背叛祖国的事情，以上就是我的罪恶的概括。
    解放以来，党和祖国人民为了把我从黑暗的泥沼中挽救出来，曾不惜任何代价派人给我送信，送宣传品，都是为了使我不断地正确地认识党的政策，让我知道在党和毛主席的正确领导下，祖国在各个生产和建设等战线上取得的辉煌成就。这些事情不断地教育着我，鼓舞着我立下了脱离残余匪帮回到祖国的坚定信心。于是，我脱离了残余匪帮回到了祖国的怀抱。当我回到祖国之初，自己虽身受着党和政府的宽大待遇和无微不至的照顾，但是我还没有完全消除顾虑。后来经过到昆明参观，省的党政领导上亲自地给予我教育，才使我正确地认识到党对于民族上层是本着长期的团结、教育、改造的政策，我才相信党和政府对我的宽大是真的，是永远不变的。事实说明了，党和人民不但对我宽大，不追不究以往的罪恶，而且还选我做云南省人民代表大会的代表，并做了云南省民族事务委员会的副主任及自治州的领导干部。这次又得来参加中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议。这些事实教育了我，使我更进一步地认识到党和毛主席民族政策的伟大，教育我要过像人的生活，只有紧密地跟着共产党毛主席走，只有跟着共产党毛主席才有光明幸福的日子过。
    我们的家乡是国防前哨，边境上还有蒋匪的残余，国外还有很多受骗的我国人民。因此，我们必须做好保卫边疆的各项工作，同时进行争取在国外的我国人民回到祖国的怀抱来。
    现在我们的西双版纳正在进行着和平协商土地改革工作。我相信在党和毛主席的正确领导下，通过了和平协商土地改革之后，将要基本上消灭剥削制度，为农村中的社会主义改造打下基础。
    我回去后将以我的全力投入此项工作，与我区人民一道把这项工作做得更快、更好，并争取在今年年底基本上完成这项任务。
