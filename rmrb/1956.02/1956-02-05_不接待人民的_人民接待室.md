    The "People's Reception Room" That Doesn't Receive the People
    To the Editor:
    In the suggestion book of the People's Reception Room of the Jiangjin Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Sichuan Province, visitors wrote the following opinions:
    "The reception room is empty."
    "The reception room doesn't seem to have dedicated personnel, leaving visitors with nowhere to make contact."
    "The reception room should not only have a room, but also comrades responsible for reception work."
    "The reception room exists in name only; where are the people? Who can we contact?"
    The masses' criticism of the reception room is entirely correct. The Jiangjin Prefectural Commissioner's Office's People's Reception Room is indeed a reception room with no one in charge. Because the leaders of this commissioner's office lack understanding of the importance of the reception room's work, they did not allocate dedicated cadres to be responsible for the reception room's work, but only assigned a clerk to manage the reception room; in addition, the leadership's education of the clerk was poor, and the clerk was not dedicated to the work, with the result that visiting masses often couldn't find anyone.
    The consequence of this situation is that many visitors with urgent problems to solve cannot get them resolved in a timely manner, wasting valuable time. For example, Comrade Wu Chuanqing from the Jiangbei County Department Store came to the commissioner's office on official business and waited for an hour in the reception room. He wrote in the suggestion book: "I was here to contact work on official business and waited for an hour in the reception room, but no one contacted me, wasting time and affecting work..." Comrade Zhang Zhongqing from the Chengdu Labor Bureau also made the same criticism.
    Visitors enthusiastically hope that the Jiangjin Prefectural Commissioner's Office will quickly improve the work of the reception room. The suggestion book states: "Some necessary systems should be established," "The leaders of the commissioner's office should regularly check the opinions in the suggestion book," "I hope you will humbly accept the opinions of the masses and improve your work," "Never commit bureaucracy again... Be good servants of the people!" The Jiangjin Prefectural Commissioner's Office did not respond to these valuable opinions in any way; possibly, the leaders of the commissioner's office didn't even look at the suggestion book in the reception room.

### 不接待人民的“人民接待室”

    不接待人民的“人民接待室”
    编辑同志：
    在四川省江津专员公署人民接待室的意见簿里，来访者写上了这样的意见：
    “接待室空无一人。”
    “接待室似无专人负责，以致来访者无处接洽。”
    “接待室不仅应该有房子，还应该有负责接待工作的同志。”
    “接待室有名无实；人在哪里？找谁联系？”
    群众对接待室的批评是完全正确的。江津专署人民接待室的确是一个无人负责的接待室。由于这个专署的领导人对接待室工作的重要意义缺乏认识，因此就没有配备负责接待室工作的专职干部，而只派了一个公务员去管理接待室；加上领导方面对公务员教育又差，公务员对工作不安心，以致来访的群众就经常找不着人。
    这种情况所造成的结果是：很多来访者急需解决的问题不能及时得到解决，白白浪费了宝贵的时间。如江北县百货公司乌传青同志因公来专署，在接待室等了一个钟头，他在意见簿上写道：“因公联系工作，在接待室等了一个钟头，竟无人接洽，浪费了时间，影响了工作……。”成都市劳动局张仲清同志也提出了同样的批评。
    来访者热情地希望江津专署很快地改进接待室的工作。意见簿里写道：“应该建立一些必要的制度”，“意见簿上的意见请专署领导同志经常检查”，“希望虚心接受群众意见，改进工作”，“决不要再犯官僚主义……好好做人民的勤务员！”对于这些宝贵的意见，江津专署并没有作任何答复；可能，专署的领导人根本没有看接待室的意见簿。
