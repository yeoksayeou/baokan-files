Xinhua News Agency, February 10th—The so-called “Subversive Activities” Control Board in the United States has listed the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship as a “subversive organization” and, citing the “Internal Security Act,” has ordered it to register with the Department of Justice.

The National Council of American-Soviet Friendship issued a statement to reporters saying that the council will immediately file a lawsuit in federal court to protest this decision, which places the American-Soviet Friendship Association under police supervision.
