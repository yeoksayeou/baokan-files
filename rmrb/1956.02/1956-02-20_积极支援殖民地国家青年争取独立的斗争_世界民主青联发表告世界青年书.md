Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th. The World Federation of Democratic Youth issued an appeal to world youth in commemoration of "Anti-Colonialism Struggle Day" on February 21st.

The appeal to world youth states that our generation is living in the greatest period in history, that is, the period when colonialism in the world is suffering a shameful collapse. However, although colonialism is irresistibly declining, it has not been completely eliminated. It still exists openly or in disguise with new deceptive means, carrying out a series of massacres, suppressions, and plunder, bringing endless poverty and political, racial, and cultural oppression.

The appeal to youth states that wherever people and youth are suffering, powerful forces are rising. In Cyprus, Goa, South Africa, Malaya, Kenya, Cameroon, and all oppressed countries, there are struggles for independence, freedom, and self-determination; everywhere the land is burning under the feet of the colonial rulers.

The appeal to world youth states that the youth of oppressed countries can believe that their struggle is not lonely, and all youth and upright people express their sympathy, friendship, and active support for them.

The appeal to youth calls on the youth of the suzerain states not to accept the lies and deceptions of those who want to turn them into mindless tools of war and enslavement, and to actively express fraternal support to the youth of colonial countries.

The appeal to youth states that uniting against colonialism means fighting to defend peace, reduce armaments, ban atomic weapons, and oppose military blocs and military bases. It also means fighting for the happiness of the people of our own country and all other countries, for the future of the younger generation, and for the progress of all mankind.

The appeal to youth concludes by calling on the youth of the world to express their support for the struggle of the youth of colonial countries through a variety of activities on February 21st.

    积极支援殖民地国家青年争取独立的斗争
    世界民主青联发表告世界青年书
    新华社布拉格18日电　世界民主青年联盟为纪念2月21日“反对殖民制度斗争日”发表了告世界青年书。
    告世界青年书说，我们这一代是处在历史上最伟大的时期，即世界上的殖民主义遭到可耻崩溃的时期。可是，尽管殖民主义在不可抗拒地衰亡，它还没有完全消灭。它仍然公开地或者以新的欺骗手段隐蔽地存在着，进行着一连串的虐杀、镇压和掠夺，带来无尽的穷困以及政治、种族和文化上的压迫。
    告青年书说，哪里有人民和青年在遭受苦难，哪里就有强大的力量在兴起。在塞浦路斯、果阿、南非、马来亚、怯尼亚、喀麦隆和所有被压迫的国家都存在着争取独立、自由和自决权的斗争，到处的土地都在殖民统治者的脚下燃烧着。
    告世界青年书说，被压迫国家的青年们可以相信他们的斗争不是孤单的，所有青年和正直的人们都对他们表示同情、友谊和积极的支持。
    告青年书号召宗主国的青年们不要接受那些想把他们变成战争和奴役的没有思想的工具的人们的谎言和欺骗，并且对殖民地国家的青年积极地表示兄弟般的支持。
    告青年书说，团结起来反对殖民主义，就是为保卫和平、裁减军备、禁止原子武器和反对军事集团和军事基地而斗争。这也就是为本国人民和所有其他各国人民的幸福而斗争，为青年一代的未来和全人类的进步而斗争。
    告青年书最后号召全世界的青年们在2月21日这一天通过多种多样的活动，对殖民地国家青年的斗争表示支援。
