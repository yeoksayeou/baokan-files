Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: The Ministry of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China announced today the "Customs Regulations on the Supervision of Luggage and Articles of Passengers Entering and Leaving the Country," "Preferential Measures of the Customs on Luggage and Articles Carried by Returned Overseas Chinese," and "Customs Regulations on the Supervision of Luggage and Articles of Passengers Traveling To and From Hong Kong or Macau." These three measures are scheduled to be implemented on March 1st.

The "Customs Regulations on the Supervision of Luggage and Articles of Passengers Entering and Leaving the Country" stipulates that, except for items prohibited from import or export, luggage and articles belonging to passengers for personal use or household purposes, and in reasonable quantities, can be exempted from import and export licenses, and are generally exempt from customs duties (commodity circulation tax and goods tax are also exempted). Only a few imported items frequently carried by passengers that have large price differences between domestic and foreign markets are subject to a "Limitation Table" in the regulations based on the normal quantities carried by general passengers. Quantities within the "Limitation Table" can also be imported duty-free.

The "Preferential Measures of the Customs on Luggage and Articles Carried by Returned Overseas Chinese" allows, in addition to the duty-free luggage and articles according to the "Customs Regulations on the Supervision of Luggage and Articles of Passengers Entering and Leaving the Country," a duty exemption of 150 yuan Renminbi for items subject to customs duties. Overseas Chinese moving back to China as a family are entitled to a duty exemption of 300 yuan Renminbi per person. In addition, this measure also stipulates preferential handling methods for items carried by Overseas Chinese that exceed the scope of personal or household use.

    海关对进出国境旅客行李物品监管等办法下月实施
    据新华社20日讯　中华人民共和国对外贸易部在今天公布了“海关对进出国境旅客行李物品监管办法”、“海关对归国华侨携带行李物品优待办法”和“海关对来往香港或澳门旅客行李物品监管办法”。这三个办法定3月1日起实施。
    “海关对进出国境旅客行李物品监管办法”规定，旅客的行李物品除禁止进口或出口的外，属于旅客个人自用或家用范围、数量合理的，都可以免领进、出口许可证，并且一般都可以免征关税（商品流通税、货物税也同时免征）。只有若干种为旅客经常携带而国内外差价较大的进口物品，在办法中根据一般旅客正常携带的数量规定了“限量表”，数量在“限量表”以内的也可以免征关税进口。
    “海关对归国华侨携带行李物品优待办法”除了按“海关对进出国境旅客行李物品监管办法”可以免税进口的行李物品外，对应征关税的物品，还可享受人民币150元的免征关税额的优待；举家搬回国内的华侨，每人可以有人民币300元的免征关税额的优待。此外，这个办法还对华侨携带超出自用、家用范围等物品规定了优待的处理办法。
