    The End of Colonialism
    By Dé Gòngdá Yē, Burmese Writer
    With a history of two thousand years, Burma ceased to be an independent nation after the British imperialists launched three colonial wars against it in 1885. During the years of colonial rule, the Burmese people suffered untold disasters, poverty, political oppression, and cultural decline.
    Burma is a backward country with rich natural resources. The colonizers plundered Burma's wealth and labor, and controlled Burma's entire economy. At that time, middle schools and universities were only for "officials," and English became the official language of Burma.
    Burma's national culture, with its glorious heritage, was submerged by "Westernism." The people maintained a low standard of living. The colonizers never industrialized our country. They wanted to keep Burma a weak and backward agricultural country that merely supplied them with cheap raw materials.
    The Burmese national liberation movement grew in various forms of struggle, such as workers' strikes and boycotts of British goods. In 1930, the famous "Tarrawaddy Rebellion" broke out, an armed peasant rebellion led by Saya San. Since then, our national liberation movement has become more enthusiastic. In 1938, students participated in the oil workers' strike and peasant demonstrations; at the same time, a national general strike occurred. This huge wave strengthened anti-colonial enthusiasm, bringing about the nationwide struggle against British colonialism in 1942, the later struggle against Japanese fascism in 1945, and finally the united power of the people forced the British colonizers to leave Burma and recognize Burma's independence in 1948.
    When Japanese fascists invaded Burma in 1942, the British fled to India, leaving Burma in a state of destruction and defenselessness.
    Burma was ravaged by British and Japanese troops. When the British left Burma, Burma was burdened with a lot of foreign debt. In order to pay for the expenses of British colonial rule during the short period of 1942-1947, Burma was forced to bear a debt of £26.7 million. These foreign debts were not due to our extravagance or abuse; this is the colonial "legacy" that still plagues us even after our independence.
    Today, all ethnic groups in Asia and Africa have been involved in a great national movement against colonialism and for national independence and human dignity.
    The colonial system means brutal exploitation, political oppression, and the plunder of economic resources. Colonialism has subjected millions of people to hunger, political enslavement, and cultural decline. This is not the nineteenth century. After years of brutal struggle, the movement against colonialism and semi-colonialism has progressed. People's China has newly emerged; it has become a fortress of the national liberation movement. India, Indonesia, and Burma have become independent new countries. The countries of Korea and Indochina are growing. French imperialism was originally unwilling to give up its colonies in Asia, but now it has been forced to succumb to the power of the Indochinese national liberation movement. However, those ugly colonial countries are not willing to abandon their plans. They are attempting to obstruct the national liberation movement in Asia by piecing together the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In Africa, the national liberation movement is flourishing, colonial shackles are being broken, and new countries are being born.
    The right of national self-determination is a basic principle of the democratic world. The United Nations Charter recognizes this right. This right of national self-determination is being violated by colonial countries that have signed the United Nations Charter.
    Last year in Bandung, the people of Asia and Africa issued a call against colonialism and raised the banner of national independence. As long as colonialism exists, the struggle for national independence will never cease. Lenin said in his 1917 Eastern Manifesto: "Let the world tremble!" The entire colonial world is trembling. The surging movement is advancing like a sea tide, impacting the outdated colonial system and sweeping across Asia and Africa. New days of economic development, social progress, cultural prosperity, and peace will soon come with the end of colonialism.

### 殖民主义的末日

    殖民主义的末日
    缅甸作家　德贡达耶
    有着两千年历史的缅甸，自从1885年英帝国主义对它发动了3次殖民战争以后，就不再是一个独立的国家了。在殖民统治的年代里，缅甸人民遭受了说不尽的灾难、贫困、政治压迫和文化衰落。
    缅甸是一个有着丰富自然资源的落后国家。殖民者掠夺了缅甸的财富和劳动，并且把缅甸的整个经济都掌握在他们手里。当时的中学和大学只为“官”用，英语成为缅甸的正式语言。
    有着辉煌遗产的缅甸民族文化被“西方主义”淹没了。人民维持着低下的生活水平。殖民者从来不使我们的国家工业化。他们要把缅甸保持为一个仅仅供给他们廉价原料的弱小和落后的农业国。
    缅甸的民族解放运动在各种不同的斗争形式中成长起来。例如工人罢工、抵制英国货等等。1930年，暴发了著名的“达拉瓦底大暴动”。那是由塞耶桑领导的农民武装暴动。从那以后我们的民族解放运动便更加激昂了。1938年学生们参加了石油工人的罢工和农民的示威游行；同时发生了全国总罢工。这个巨大的浪潮增强了反殖民主义的热情，带来了1942年反对英国殖民主义的全国性斗争和后来1945年的反对日本法西斯的斗争，以及最后人民的联合力量迫使英国殖民者离开缅甸，并于1948年承认缅甸的独立。
    当1942年日本法西斯侵入缅甸的时候，英国人逃到印度去，而使缅甸陷于被破坏和无防御的处境。
    缅甸曾经遭到英国和日本军队的蹂躏。当英国人离开缅甸的时候，缅甸负有很多外债。为了支付1942—1947年这个短短的时期内英国殖民统治的费用，缅甸被迫担负了2，670万英镑的债务。这些外债并不是由于我们的奢侈或者滥用，这是甚至在我国独立之后还折磨我们的殖民主义“遗产”。
    今天，亚洲和非洲的各族人民都已卷入了反对殖民主义、争取民族独立和人类尊严的一个伟大的民族运动中。
    殖民制度意味着残酷的剥削、政治的压迫和经济资源的掠夺。殖民主义使千百万人民遭受饥饿、政治奴役和文化衰退。现在不是十九世纪了。经过了若干年的残酷斗争以后，反对殖民主义和半殖民主义的运动已有了进展。人民中国在新近出现了；它成为民族解放运动的堡垒。印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸已成了独立的新国家。朝鲜和印度支那的国家在生长。法国帝国主义原来不肯放弃它在亚洲的殖民地，现在已被迫向印度支那民族解放运动的力量屈服了。但是，那些丑恶的殖民国家并不甘心情愿抛弃它们的计划。它们企图以拼凑东南亚条约组织来阻碍亚洲的民族解放运动。在非洲，民族解放运动正蓬勃地发展，殖民枷锁正在被打破，新的国家在诞生。
    各民族的自决权是民主世界的一种基本原则。联合国宪章是承认这项权利的。这种民族自决的权利正遭受着在联合国宪章上签字的殖民国家的违犯。
    去年在万隆，亚非人民发出了反殖民主义的呼声，并扬起了民族独立的旗帜。只要殖民主义存在一天，争取民族独立的斗争就将永不停息。列宁曾在他1917年的东方宣言中说：“让世界发抖吧”！整个殖民世界是在发抖。澎湃的运动像海潮般的向前推进，冲击着过时的殖民制度，席卷了亚洲和非洲。经济发展、社会进步、文化昌盛和和平的新日子将很快地随着殖民主义的末日而来到。
