    A Village That Emphasizes Hygiene
    Comrade Editor:
    Since Zhongqiao Township, Xundian County, Yunnan Province, achieved semi-socialist collectivization last year, many new developments have also emerged in hygiene work. Now, all 9 agricultural cooperatives in the township have jointly established 6 health clinics, with 16 health workers and 2 midwives. These health workers are able to grasp the usage of commonly used medicines and provide timely treatment for farmers' general illnesses. In addition to actively promoting new methods of delivery, midwives also regularly conduct health education for pregnant women.
    Because the farmers recognize that good health is necessary for good production, they have developed hygienic habits. From August to December last year, all 9 agricultural cooperatives in the township cleared 3,140 loads of garbage, 9,241 loads of weeds, eliminated approximately 500 jin of flies, and caught 1,644 rats. In addition, they also dug 15 new toilets, renovated 62 toilets, dredged 112 drainage ditches, and cleaned 4 wells. The members of the Rising Sun Agricultural Cooperative conduct a major cleaning of the public environment every 7 days, wash their quilts once every two months, and frequently wash their hands and feet and change their clothes. Yu Chaokuan, the hygiene committee member of the 12th Agricultural Cooperative, led everyone to cover all the toilets and changed the old habit of accumulating fertilizer.
    Recently, Zhongqiao Township made a comprehensive plan for hygiene work, deciding that this year all toilets in the township must be covered, wells must have well railings, and public water buckets must be used; people and livestock must be separated; and three medical and health stations must be established to prevent and promptly eradicate infectious diseases.

    一个讲究卫生的乡村
    编辑同志：
    云南省寻甸县中桥乡去年实现了半社会主义的合作化以后，在卫生工作中也出现了许多新的气象。现在全乡有9个农业社联合成立了6个卫生室，有16名保健员和两名接生员。这些保健员都能掌握常用成药的用法，及时为农民们治疗一般的疾病；接生员除了积极推行新法接生以外，还经常向孕妇进行卫生教育。
    由于农民们认识了只有身体好才能搞好生产，因此他们养成了讲究卫生的习惯。全乡9个农业社从去年8月到12月就清除了3，140挑垃圾、9，241挑杂草，扑灭了苍蝇约500市斤，捕捉老鼠1，644只。此外，他们还新挖了15个厕所，整修了62个厕所，疏通了112条阴沟，淘了4个水井。太阳升农业社的社员们每7天对公共环境进行一次清洁大扫除，每两个月洗一次被子，还经常洗手洗脚和换洗衣服。第12农业社的卫生委员余朝宽带动大家把全部厕所加了盖，改变了旧的积肥的习惯。
    最近，中桥乡对卫生工作作出了全面规划，决定在今年要做到乡里的全部厕所加盖，水井加井栏，并且使用公共水桶；要做到人畜分居；要成立三个医疗保健站，以便预防和及时扑灭传染病。
