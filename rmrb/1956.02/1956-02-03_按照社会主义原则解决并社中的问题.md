    Resolving Problems in Merging Cooperatives According to Socialist Principles
    Yao Wenjin
    On December 30, 1955, the Chenjiazhuang, Wujiawa, and Tengjiagou three elementary cooperatives in Daren County, Shanxi Province decided to merge and transform into the "Oriental Red" advanced cooperative. All members of the three elementary cooperatives believed that after the merger, they could fully utilize the different natural conditions of the three cooperatives, conduct unified production planning, have greater advantages, and increase income. Although the "Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" had clear regulations on the issue of public accumulation, disputes still occurred during the merger process. Chenjiazhuang Cooperative had more public accumulation, averaging nearly 70 yuan per household, while Wujiawa and Tengjiagou Cooperatives had very little public accumulation, averaging only 19 yuan per household. The members of Chenjiazhuang demanded that the members of Wujiawa and Tengjiagou make up the difference in public accumulation, but the members of Wujiawa and Tengjiagou did not have the ability to do so. After discussion, the Party branch decided not to make them. This caused great dissatisfaction among the members of Chenjiazhuang, who felt that it was not mutually beneficial without making up the difference, that they were losing out because they had retained more public accumulation, and even advocated for taking out a portion of the public accumulation to distribute to everyone. In short, the issue of public accumulation became a key problem in the merger and transformation of the cooperatives.
    In order to solve this problem, with the help of the Party committee work team, the Party branch conducted meticulous socialist education for the members.
    The first step in socialist education was to vigorously promote the overall planning after the merger. According to the overall plan after the merger, income will increase 11 times in the next 12 years. Without merging and transforming the cooperatives, it would be impossible to increase income so much. Firstly, Chenjiazhuang was originally suitable for growing millet and glutinous millet, while Tengjiagou was originally suitable for growing sorghum and beans, but in order to eat potatoes, the members had to allocate thousands of mu of land to grow potatoes every year. And Wujiawa, which was originally suitable for growing potatoes, had to allocate thousands of mu of land to grow millet and glutinous millet every year in order to eat grain. After the merger and transformation of the cooperatives, unified planning can be carried out, and crops can be planted according to local conditions, greatly increasing the potential of the land. This alone can increase the cooperative's annual output by the equivalent of 170,000 jin of grain. Secondly, without merging and transforming the cooperatives, the potential of the pasture cannot be realized, and land reclamation will also be restricted. For example, although Chenjiazhuang has more cattle and sheep, it cannot continue to develop because there is no more pasture for development. Wujiawa and Tengjiagou have large pastures available, but they do not have cattle and sheep. Furthermore, if Chenjiazhuang wants to reclaim land, it has to reduce the pasture, which will hinder the development of animal husbandry. Moreover, it is impossible to spare a large amount of surplus labor for large-scale land reclamation. However, after the merger and transformation of the cooperatives, not only is the contradiction between pasture and the development of cattle and sheep resolved, but also the contradiction between land reclamation and retaining pasture is resolved. Moreover, due to the more rational concentration of labor, surplus labor can be used to reclaim more than 2,000 mu of wasteland, increasing grain production by 137,000 jin. It is estimated that in the first year after the merger and transformation of the cooperatives, the cooperative's income will increase by more than one-third. Once the Party branch publicized the advantages of the merger and transformation of the cooperatives to the masses, the masses understood very clearly: if they insisted on making up the public accumulation, the merger and transformation of the cooperatives would not succeed, and the overall plan would not be realized. This would not only be unfavorable to Wujiawa and Tengjiagou, which have less public accumulation, but also to Chenjiazhuang, which has more public accumulation.
    The second step in socialist education was to mobilize members to discuss, "Where does public accumulation come from?" Because many members believed that public accumulation was created by their own labor, and that merging the cooperatives to make it collectively owned meant they were losing out. For example, member Zhang Ru was a representative of this type of member. The Party branch used him as an example to calculate an account. In 1951, when he was working individually, he did not retain any public accumulation, but his income was only 216 yuan. In 1953, after he joined the cooperative, although the cooperative retained some public accumulation, his income increased to 260 yuan, and in 1955 it further increased to 390 yuan. This shows that public accumulation is gradually accumulated on the basis of the general increase in members' income, and not accumulated by reducing members' income. This also shows that public accumulation cannot be created by any one person alone, but is created collectively under the leadership of the Party, with the support of the state, and through the joint labor of all members of the cooperative. Merging public accumulation into a larger advanced cooperative cannot be said to be a loss for anyone, but only that everyone is sharing the light of socialism, and after the merger and transformation of the cooperatives, they can share even greater light of socialism.
    The third step in socialist education was to make everyone aware of the benefits that public accumulation brings to everyone. For example, in 1952, Chenjiazhuang Cooperative used public accumulation to buy a rubber-wheeled cart and hauled back more than 1,000 cartloads of fertilizer from the city, increasing the cooperative's income by 1,500 yuan for the whole year. Furthermore, in 1953, Chenjiazhuang Cooperative used public accumulation to buy a dozen fine-wool breeding sheep and two Holstein breeding cattle, and has now bred more than 200 fine-wool sheep and 8 Holstein cattle. In the future, it will completely realize the breeding of fine breeds of cattle and sheep, greatly increasing the income from animal husbandry. This powerfully showed the members that public accumulation is socialist property, the foundation for everyone's common prosperity, and something that is sacred and inviolable. To take out a portion of the public accumulation to distribute to everyone is a wrong act that violates socialist principles, harms collective interests, and ultimately harms individual interests.
    Finally, the Party branch also educated the members that it is a socialist principle for the advanced to help the backward. It explained that such help may seem like a loss if viewed from the perspective of immediate interests, but it is still mutually beneficial if viewed from the perspective of long-term interests. The Party branch used Chenjiazhuang's expansion of the cooperative in 1953 to illustrate this point. At that time, some old members also wanted the new members to make up the public accumulation, but after the Party's education they did not, but they still thought that the new members had benefited and they had lost out. Later, with the expansion of the cooperative, it demonstrated greater advantages, and the members' income increased even more. The new members became richer, and the old members became even richer. At this time, those old members realized that if the cooperative had not been expanded, things would not have been so good, and they almost ruined things for the sake of a little public accumulation.
    After these four steps of education, the Party branch pointed out to all the members that they must look forward, not backward, they must use a "big abacus," not a "small abacus," and they must think from the perspective of long-term interests, not just consider immediate interests. In this way, the idea of Chenjiazhuang members insisting that the other two cooperatives make up the public accumulation was reversed, and their socialist consciousness was raised. They said: "We are letting go of a whole cow and instead fighting over a single hair?" As a result, the three cooperatives smoothly completed the merger and transformation work, and are now working hard to achieve this year's production increase plan.

    按照社会主义原则解决并社中的问题
    姚文锦
    1955年12月30日，山西省大仁县的陈家庄、吴家洼和滕家沟的三个初级社决定合并转为“东方红”高级社了。三个初级社的所有社员都认为合并以后，可以充分利用三个社不同的自然条件，可以进行统一的生产规划，优越性会更大，收入也会更多。在公共积累的问题上，虽然“农业生产合作社示范章程草案”中有了明确的规定，但在并社过程中，仍然发生了纠纷。陈家庄合作社的公共积累较多，每户平均近70元，而吴家洼和滕家沟合作社的公共积累很少，每户平均只有19元。陈家庄的社员就要求吴家洼和滕家沟的社员把公共积累补齐，但吴家洼和滕家沟的社员没力量补齐。支部研究以后还是决定不补。这可引起陈家庄社员的很大不满，认为不补就不是互利，认为多留了公积金使得自己吃亏，甚至主张把公共积累抽出一部分给大家分掉。总之，公共积累问题成为并社和转社中的一个关键问题了。
    为了解决这个问题，支部在地委工作组的帮助下，对社员进行了细致的社会主义教育。
    社会主义教育的第一步是大力宣传了并社以后的全面规划。按照并社以后的全面规划，今后12年收入将要增加11倍。如果不并社不转社，根本不可能增加这样多的收入。首先，陈家庄本来宜种谷子、黍子，滕家沟本来宜种高粱、豆子，可是社员为了吃土豆，每年不得不抽出上千亩的土地去种土豆。而本来宜种土豆的吴家洼，为了吃粮食，每年又不得不抽出上千亩的土地去种谷子和黍子。合并转社以后，就可以统一规划，因地种植，大大发挥土地潜力，仅仅这一项，全社每年增产所得即可折合17万斤粮食。其次，不合并，不转社，牧场的潜力不能发挥，开荒也要受到限制。比如陈家庄虽然有较多的牛羊，但已不能继续发展，因为再发展就没有牧场。吴家洼和滕家沟虽有大片可供使用的牧场，却没有牛羊。再如，陈家庄要开荒，就要缩小牧场，这就会妨害畜牧业的发展。而且，也不可能抽出大量的剩余劳动进行大规模的开荒，而并社和转社以后，不但牧场和发展牛羊的矛盾解决了，开荒和保留牧场的矛盾也解决了，而且由于劳动力的更加合理集中地使用，可以用剩余劳动开垦荒地2，000多亩，增产粮食137，000斤。估计，并社和转社后的第一年、全社即可增加收入三分之一以上。支部把并社和转社的优越性向群众一宣传，群众就看得非常明白：如果硬要补齐公共积累，并社和转社就不能成功，全面规划就不能实现，这不但对公共积累较少的吴家洼和滕家沟没利，就是对公共积累较多的陈家庄同样没利。
    社会主义教育的第二步是发动社员讨论，“公共积累从哪里来？”因为不少社员认为公共积累是自己劳动创造的，并社要归集体所有，就是自己吃了亏。比如社员张如就是这类社员的代表。支部就拿他作例子算了一笔帐。1951年他单干的时候，并没有留过什么公积金，但他的收入只有216元。1953年他入社后，虽然社里留了一些公积金，他的收入却增加到260元，1955年更增加到390元。这说明，公共积累是在社员收入普遍增加的基础上逐步积累起来的，并不是用减少社员收入的办法积累起来的。这也说明，公共积累并不是任何一个人可以单独去创造的，而是在党的领导下，在国家的支援下，在合作社全体社员共同劳动下集体创造出来的。公共积累并入更大的高级合作社，不能说谁吃了亏，只能说大家共同沾了社会主义的光，并社和转社以后，就能共同沾更大的社会主义的光。
    社会主义教育的第三步是要大家认识公共积累给大家带来的好处。如陈家庄社1952年用公共积累买了一辆胶皮车拉回了1，000多车城里的粪肥，全年给社里增加了1，500元的收入。又如陈家庄社1953年用公共积累买了十几只细毛种羊和两头荷兰种牛，到现在就繁殖了200多头细毛羊和8头荷兰牛，将来还要完全实现牛羊良种化，使畜牧业的收入大大增加。这就向社员有力地说明，公共积累是社会主义财产，是大家共同富裕的根基，是神圣不可侵犯的东西。要是抽出一部分公共积累分给大家，这是违背社会主义原则，损害集体利益，归根到底也损害了个人利益的错误行为。
    最后，支部又向社员进行了先进帮助落后是社会主义原则的教育。说明这种帮助如果单从眼前利益出发，好像是吃亏，但如果从长远利益去看，仍然是互利。支部就用1953年陈家庄的扩社说明这个道理。当时，有些老社员也要新社员补公积金，经过党的教育没有补，但他们还认为是新社员占了便宜、自己吃了亏。以后，随着社的扩大，发挥了更大的优越性，社员的收入有了更大的增加。新社员富裕了，老社员更富裕了。这时，那些老社员才认识到不是扩了社，那有这么好，险些为了一点公积金误了大事。
    经过这样四步教育以后，支部就向全体社员指出，必须向前看，不要向后看，必须打“大算盘”，不要打“小算盘”，必须从长远利益上着想，不要只在眼前利益上考虑。这样，陈家庄社员坚持要另外两个社补公积金的思想扭转了，社会主义的觉悟提高了，他们说：“咱们是放着个整牛不去牵，却抓住一根牛毛争短长呢？”于是，三个社就顺利地完成并社和转社工作，正在为实现今年的增产规划而紧张劳动。
