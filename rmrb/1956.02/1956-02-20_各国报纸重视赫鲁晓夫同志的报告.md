The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial stating that the report made by Comrade N.S. Khrushchev at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a programmatic document for the current stage and a guiding star for the actions of people of all countries in the world in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

The editorial said that all the Korean people attach great importance to this historically significant report. The editorial said that the Korean people support and sincerely welcome the Soviet Union's persistent peace-loving foreign policy and firmly believe that this policy, as in the past, will gain greater victories with the joint support of all peace-loving countries.

The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published an editorial on February 17 saying that this report makes us clearly see the amazing progress of the Soviet Union on the road to communism. The report also clarified the major issues of the international situation and the consolidation of world peace. The editorial said that the great achievements of the Soviet Union and the obvious facts of the increasing decay of the imperialist countries are standards for the people of all countries to use for comparison and drawing conclusions.

The editorial specifically pointed out that Khrushchev indicated that the elimination of colonialism has become an urgent demand of all colonial and dependent countries. The editorial said: "This understanding is completely in line with the actual situation of the vigorously developing national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South America."

The Indian newspaper "New India Times" said: The wishes expressed by Khrushchev should be welcomed everywhere. He said he hoped to make the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence the basis of friendly relations with Western countries. His speech showed that Russia advocates peace and believes in the principle of coexistence. The "National Herald" published a commentary on February 16 saying that Khrushchev's proposal in the report to stop hydrogen bomb tests "will undoubtedly make a deep impression in Asia and Africa, especially after Eden confirmed the United States' refusal to stop atomic explosions." The newspaper said: "There is sufficient evidence to prove the sincerity of the Soviet Union's peace policy," and "there is no reason for Western countries to continue to adopt such crude and unrealistic policies."

The Polish "Trybuna Ludu" published an editorial pointing out that the entire socialist camp played a special role in the struggle for peaceful coexistence, and our country also played a role in this camp. The internal strength and unity of this camp, as well as its material and defensive strength, are of decisive significance for sobering up the adventurer groups and for the growth of peace forces throughout the world.

The Hungarian "Szabad Nép" published an editorial saying that the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union set an example of Marxist-Leninist analysis based on facts and rigorous scientific research.

The newspaper then said that a well-known slander is popular in the West: the Soviet Union advocates peaceful coexistence for tactical considerations. Khrushchev not only thoroughly exposed this slander, but also irrefutably proved that the efforts to achieve communism are completely in line with the proposition of peaceful coexistence. The Communists hope to achieve the complete victory of the socialist system entirely in the form of peaceful competition between the two systems, that is to say, the Communists are firmly opposed to war.

Berlin's democratic newspapers published editorials commenting on Khrushchev's report. "Neues Deutschland" wrote that Khrushchev's statement that a third world war is not inevitable filled everyone with new confidence, which is of particular practical significance for the German people. The newspaper said: "In view of West Germany's policy of remilitarization and Adenauer's war threats, many people in our republic and in West Germany are asking whether war is inevitable on German territory? The German Democratic Republic is an important part of the powerful force with the spiritual and material means to stop a new world war."

British newspapers paid close attention to the opening of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the report of its Central Committee. The "Times" published a detailed summary of the foreign policy part of the report under the title "Coexistence is the basis of Soviet policy...The desire to improve relations with Britain remains." The "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" paid particular attention to the parts of the report on the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the two systems and avoiding war in our time. The newspaper reported on the progress of the conference under the title "Soviet Union Says War is Not Inevitable...Coexistence is the 'Only Choice'".

The "Daily Worker" criticized in an editorial some of the most reactionary bourgeois newspapers for attempting to diminish the significance of the Soviet Union's economic construction achievements. The editorial said that the people of countries still suffering from capitalist oppression and exploitation are increasingly aware of the great significance of these achievements.

American newspapers such as "The New York Times" and "New York Herald Tribune," which are intent on exacerbating international tensions, deliberately distorted the work of the Congress, particularly keen to distort the argument that war is not necessarily inevitable at present, and that social transformation does not necessarily mean armed struggle. For example, the "New York Herald Tribune" insisted that the Communist Party's view is that their goal can only be achieved by "violently overthrowing the entire existing social system." The reason why these newspapers do this is to make it easier to insist that the principle of peaceful coexistence and the growth of Soviet economic strength are a "threat" to the United States, and to call on the United States to further expand its armaments.

At the same time, many newspapers and magazines acknowledged the great significance of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and pointed out that the United States must formulate a foreign policy that adapts to changes in the international situation. These newspapers accused the politicians who control American foreign policy of diplomatic failures in recent years.

For example, Mrs. Thompson, a commentator for the Washington "Star," said that the summary report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is "a report on the achievements of Soviet policy," and the tone of the report is particularly full of confidence. Mrs. Thompson pointed out that the Soviet leaders "are watching the course of world events, analyzing this process, observing which side the feelings of the majority tend to, leading the dominant trend in the world, and promoting this trend." Mrs. Thompson said that they "declare themselves partners and allies of those powerful forces that already exist," which are the national liberation movements of various countries, "the desire of millions of people and their governments to get rid of military blocs and alliances," and "the universal fear of a new world war." Mrs. Thompson pointed out the flexibility of Soviet policy and expressed dissatisfaction with the United States "acting as if nothing has changed."

Commentators reflecting the views of those who calmly assess the current international situation called on everyone to consider the strength of the Soviet Union and its willingness to coexist peacefully with the people of other countries. The St. Louis "Post-Dispatch" said that Khrushchev's report shows that in the Soviet Union, "public opinion is firmly in favor of a proactive policy of defending peace," and the newspaper advocated resolving disputes through peaceful competition rather than through war.

The American trade journal "Business Week" also agreed with the principle of peaceful coexistence and competition, while believing that the West will not easily win in this competition.

"Star" commentator Bren said that Washington believes that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "is more important than any previous congress."

### 各国报纸重视赫鲁晓夫同志的报告

    各国报纸重视赫鲁晓夫同志的报告
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论说，由尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上所作的苏联共产党中央委员会的报告，是目前阶段的一篇纲领性的文件以及全世界各国人民在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中的行动的引路星。
    社论说，全体朝鲜人民非常重视这篇具有历史意义的报告。社论说，朝鲜人民支持并且衷心欢迎苏联的坚持不渝的爱好和平的外交政策，并且坚决相信：这种政策将同过去一样，在一切爱好和平的国家的共同支持下，获得更大的胜利。
    越南“人民报”2月17日发表社论说，这个报告使我们明确地看到苏联在走向共产主义道路上的惊人的进展。这个报告并且阐明了国际局势和巩固世界和平的重大问题。社论说，苏联的伟大成就和帝国主义国家的日益腐朽情况的显明事实，是各国人民拿来作为比较和下结论的标准。
    社论特别指出，赫鲁晓夫指明在目前取消殖民主义已经成为各殖民地和附属国的迫切要求。社论说：“这种认识完全符合于亚洲、非洲、中近东和南美洲蓬勃发展中的民族解放运动的实际情况。”
    印度报纸“新印度时报”说：赫鲁晓夫所表达的愿望应该在各处都受到欢迎。他说，他希望使和平共处的五项原则成为对西方国家的友好关系的基础。他的演说表明：俄国主张和平，并且相信共处原则。“国民先驱报”在2月16日发表评论说：赫鲁晓夫在报告中提出的停止氢弹试验的建议，“无疑地将在亚洲和非洲造成深刻的印象，特别是在艾登证实了美国拒绝停止原子爆炸之后。”报纸说：“有足够的证据证明苏联的和平政策是真诚的”，“西方国家继续采取这样粗卤而不现实的政策是毫无理由的。”
    波兰“人民论坛报”发表社论指出：在争取和平共处的斗争中，整个社会主义阵营发挥了特别的作用，在这个阵营内我们的国家也发挥了作用。这个阵营的内部力量和团结以及它的物质和防御力量对于使冒险家集团头脑清醒过来，对于全世界和平力量的成长具有决定性的意义。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”发表社论说，苏联共产党中央委员会的报告树立了一个以事实和严密的科学研究为基础的马克思列宁主义分析的榜样。
    这家报纸接着说，西方流行一种人所共知的污蔑的说法：苏联主张和平共处是由于策略上的考虑。赫鲁晓夫不仅彻底揭露了这种污蔑，而且无可争辩地证明：为实现共产主义而作的努力，是同和平共处的主张完全符合的。共产党人希望获得社会主义制度的完全胜利，完全是按照两个制度和平竞赛的方式，这就是说，共产党人是坚决反对战争的。
    柏林民主报纸纷纷发表社论，评论赫鲁晓夫的报告。“新德意志报”写道，赫鲁晓夫所说的第三次世界大战不是不可避免的这句话，使每一个人充满了新的信心，而这对德国人民说来，特别具有很重要的现实意义。这个报纸说：“鉴于西德的重新军国主义化的政策和阿登纳的战争威胁，在我们共和国内和西德地区有许多人在问，在德国领土上战争是不是不可避免的呢？德意志民主共和国是具有制止新的世界大战的精神和物质手段的强大力量的重要部分。”
    英国报纸非常注意苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的开幕和苏联共产党中央委员会的报告。“泰晤士报”以“共处是苏联政策的基础……改善对英国关系的愿望仍然存在”为题，刊登了报告中外交政策部分的详细摘要。“每日电讯与晨邮报”特别注意报告中关于两种制度和平共处和在我们的时代避免战争的可能性的部分。这家报纸以“苏联说战争不是不可避免的……共处是‘唯一的选择’”为题，报道了大会进行的情况。
    “工人日报”在社论里斥责某些最反动的资产阶级报纸企图缩小苏联经济建设成就的意义。社论说，仍然受着资本主义压迫和剥削的国家的人民，越来越认识这些成就的重大意义。
    美国报纸如“纽约时报”和“纽约先驱论坛报”这些一心想加剧国际紧张局势的报纸故意歪曲代表大会的工作，特别热中于歪曲这种论点：战争目前并不是注定不可避免的，社会改造并不一定意味着武装斗争。例如“纽约先驱论坛报”就硬说共产党的观点是：唯有用“暴力推翻整个现有的社会制度”才能实现他们的目标。这些报纸所以要这样作，是为了便于硬说和平共处的原则和苏联经济力量的增长是对美国的“威胁”，而号召美国要进一步扩充军备。
    同时，许多报纸和杂志却承认苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的重大意义，并且指出，美国必须制定出适应国际情况变化的对外政策。这些报纸指责那些掌握美国对外政策的政治家最近几年来使美国在外交上失败。
    例如，华盛顿“明星报”的评论员汤普逊夫人说，苏联共产党中央委员会的总结报告是“苏联政策所取得的成就的通报”，报告的口吻特别充满信心。汤普逊夫人指出，苏联的领导人“注视着世界事件的进程，分析这个进程，观察着多数人的感觉究竟倾向哪一方，领导着在全世界居统治地位的倾向，并且推动这种倾向”。汤普逊夫人说，他们“宣称自己是那些已经存在着的强大力量的伙伴和盟友”，这种力量就是各国人民的民族解放运动、“千百万人和他们的政府要求摆脱军事集团和同盟的愿望”以及“对新的世界大战的普遍恐惧”。汤普逊夫人指出苏联政策的灵活性，并且对美国“就好像什么变化也不曾有过似地行动”表示不满。
    反映冷静地估计当前国际局势的人士的看法的评论员号召大家考虑苏联的力量以及它要求同其他国家人民和平共处的意愿。圣路易出版的“圣路易邮报”说，赫鲁晓夫的报告说明，在苏联，“舆论是坚决拥护积极的保卫和平政策的”，这家报纸主张通过和平竞赛而不是通过战争来解决争执中的问题。
    美国贸易界机关报“商业周刊”也表示同意和平共处和竞赛的原则，同时认为在这个竞赛中西方不会轻易取胜。
    “明星报”评论员布伦说，华盛顿认为，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会“比以往历次代表大会都要重要”。
