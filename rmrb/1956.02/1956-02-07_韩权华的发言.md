    Chairman, Esteemed Committee Members, Esteemed Representatives:
    Speaking today at such a solemn and grand gathering fills my heart with indescribable honor and excitement.
    I am a woman who only recently returned to the motherland.
    Last night, I met Chairman Mao at Huairen Hall. His warm and fervent concern left me so moved that I could not find the words to express my gratitude. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely add to what I said to Chairman Mao: To be able to return to the Chairman's presence and serve the motherland, as a Chinese person, our lives have not been lived in vain.
    My time back in the embrace of the motherland has been short. Before returning, through newspaper reports and word-of-mouth accounts, I had imagined the glorious achievements of the motherland. But to return and witness with my own eyes the actual, completely renewed face of the country, has surpassed my imagination countless times. My feeling at the time was exactly like the idiom says: "Only seven days in the mountains, yet thousands of years have passed in the world."
    In the ten months since my return, I have visited many factories, farms, and scenic spots in Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, Beijing, and Tianjin. What I have seen is truly an earth-shattering transformation. The former dilapidated, decaying, and moribund China has, in a short five or six years, been transformed into a prosperous and strong nation. Our beloved motherland has already stood tall in the world with a brand new appearance.
    The developments of the recent months have been even more significant. Following the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the entire country has launched the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts. Our country's capitalists have all peacefully entered socialist society amidst the joyful atmosphere of gongs and drums and deafening firecrackers. Living in such a great era is a very profound education for me, making me realize that such a miracle could only occur under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao.
    I have also seen that with the liberation of the motherland, our 300 million women have also stood up. Our sisters suffered endless pain under the feudal shackles of the past thousands of years. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberated us. Today, women throughout the country not only enjoy completely equal status with men in politics, economics, culture, society, family, and all other aspects, but also have outstanding and excellent sisters in factories, farms, enterprises, organizations, and any profession, displaying their wisdom and creative labor. I truly feel that the great Communist Party and the wise Chairman Mao have brought endless happiness to the 600 million people of New China and have enabled us women to achieve a thorough emancipation. Words cannot express our gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We can only express it through practical actions, diligently studying to transform our thinking, and actively striving in our work.
    I wholeheartedly support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. What moved me most in it was the part about Taiwan. Because there, our 8 million compatriots are still suffering under the iron heel of American imperialism. In his report, Chairman Zhou once again pointed out the bright path for the Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan. Anyone, as long as they are willing to respond to the call of the motherland for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, can receive lenient treatment for past offenses, no matter how great their past crimes. Such leniency is truly unprecedented in history. This fully demonstrates how much the people of the motherland hope that our compatriots in Taiwan can return to the big family of the motherland through the path of peaceful liberation.
    We are all Chinese people. We are rejoicing here, while they are frowning there. We are on Chinese soil, but here is a happy paradise, while there is a dark hell. I feel that now is the best opportunity for them to save themselves and promote patriotism. Especially patriotic women, everyone has the responsibility to enlighten and advise their husbands, to muster courage, to strive for the early liberation of Taiwan, to return to the warm and peaceful motherland, and to reunite with their families and relatives, to build the motherland together with the compatriots of the whole country, and to share the beautiful and happy life of socialism.
    Chairman Zhou said: "Taiwan is China's sacred territory, and the Taiwan compatriots are an inseparable part of the Chinese people." Not only must we compatriots of the motherland liberate Taiwan, but our Taiwan compatriots will never willingly endure the enslavement of American imperialism for long. With the mighty strength of our 600 million people united, no matter what method we take, we have the confidence that Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of the motherland. Taiwan compatriots, the people of the motherland are calling you, hoping that you will actively struggle, strive to break away from reactionary oppression, and become people of a world of independent, rich, strong, glorious and great New China as soon as possible. I think this is also what the Taiwan compatriots urgently hope for.
    I returned to the country late and have not studied enough. I guarantee that I will strengthen my studies in the future, transform myself, and contribute all my strength to the socialist construction of the motherland under the leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    My mood is constantly excited, and I want to shout:
    Long live our great motherland!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

    韩权华的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    今天在这样一个庄严盛大的会场上发言，使我内心感到说不出的光荣、说不出的兴奋。
    我是一个不久以前才回到祖国来的妇女。
    昨天晚上在怀仁堂见了毛主席，毛主席那样亲切热烈的关怀，使我激动得找不出一句话来表达我的感激。我愿意现在在这里由衷的向毛主席补说一句：我们能够回到主席面前为祖国服务，作为中国人，我们这一生才不白过。
    我回到祖国怀抱的时间很短。回国以前，由报刊上的记载和口头的传闻中，我也曾经想像到祖国的辉煌成就，可是回来亲眼看到实际上焕然一新的面貌，实在超过想像不知多少倍。当时的感觉，正像一句成语所说：“山中方七日，世上几千年”。
    回国十个月中，我曾经在广州、杭州、上海、无锡、北京、天津等地参观了很多的工厂、农庄和名胜古迹，所看到的一切，真是一个翻天复地的大变动。从前那个破烂不堪、陈腐垂亡的中国，在短短的五六年间，一变而为兴盛强大的国家。我们可爱的祖国已经以崭新的姿态屹立于世界。
    最近几个月来的发展更为重大，随着农业合作化的高潮，全国展开了资本主义工商业和手工业的改造。我国的资本家们都是在锣鼓喧天、爆竹震耳的欢乐气氛里和平进入了社会主义社会。生活在这样一个伟大的时代中，对我实在是一个非常深刻的教育，使我体会到，只有在中国共产党和伟大的毛主席领导下，才能出现这样的奇迹。
    我也看到，随着祖国的解放，我们3万万妇女也站了起来啦。我们姐妹们在过去几千年的封建枷锁下，受尽人间痛苦，共产党和毛主席解放了我们。今天我们全国妇女不但在政治、经济、文化、社会、家庭以及各方面都和男子一样，处在完全同等的地位，并且无论工厂、农庄、企业、机关团体以及任何职业都有出色的、优秀的姊妹们发挥她们的智慧和创造性的劳动。我真正感觉到，伟大的共产党和英明的毛主席给新中国6万万人民带来了无穷的幸福，更使我们妇女得到了彻底的翻身。这不是用言语可以表达我们对共产党和毛主席的感激，我们只有拿实际行动来表现，认真学习来改造我们的思想，和积极努力我们的工作。
    周恩来主席的政治报告，我衷心拥护。内中使我最感动的是关于台湾部分。因为在那里我们有着800万同胞仍旧处于水深火热的美帝国主义铁蹄之下。周主席在他的报告中再一次向台湾的国民党人员指出了他们的光明出路，任何人，只要愿意响应祖国和平解放台湾的号召，都可以受到既往不咎的宽大待遇，不管他从前犯过多大罪过。这种政策的宽大，真可以说是史无前例。这充分说明祖国人民多么希望台湾的同胞们能够通过和平解放的道路回到祖国大家庭。
    同是中国人，我们在这里欢欣鼓舞，他们在那里愁眉不展，同是中国地，我们这里是幸福乐园，他们那里是黑暗地狱。我觉得现在正是他们拯救自己发扬爱国心最好的机会。尤其是爱国的妇女们，大家有责任启发劝告他们的丈夫们，鼓起勇气来，争取台湾的早日解放，返回温暖安乐的祖国，和他们的家人亲友重新团聚，跟全国同胞一同建设祖国，共享社会主义的美好幸福的生活。
    周主席说：“台湾是中国的神圣领土，台湾同胞是中国人民不可分离的一部分”。这不但我们祖国同胞一定要解放台湾，我们台湾的同胞也决不甘心长此忍受美帝国主义的奴役。我们以6亿人民团结起来的强大力量，无论采取任何方式，我们都有信心，台湾一定要归还祖国的怀抱。台湾的同胞们，祖国人民在召唤你们，希望你们积极奋斗，争取脱离反动压迫，早日作为一个世界上独立富强光荣而伟大的新中国的人民。我想这也是台湾同胞们所迫切希望的。
    我回国较晚，学习不够。我保证今后一定努力加强学习，改造自己，在伟大的共产党和毛主席领导下，为祖国的社会主义建设贡献自己所有的力量。
    我的心情始终是激动的，我要高呼：
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
