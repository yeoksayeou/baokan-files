    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's political report, I felt infinitely excited and encouraged. I wholeheartedly support this report and am willing to contribute all my strength to its implementation. At the same time, I fully agree with Vice Chairman Li Jishen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National Committee, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the upsurge of the socialist revolution, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and Committee Member Chen Boda's report on the socialist transformation of Chinese agriculture. I have gained a lot from these important reports in terms of learning, and have benefited greatly. They have helped me understand many issues and improved my ideological understanding. In the future, I will strengthen my studies, work hard, and strive for self-transformation to show my sincere support and full support for these reports.
    I deeply realize that in recent years, under the wise and correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, our country has made remarkable progress and brilliant achievements in all aspects of both domestic construction and international activities. Especially in the past year, our country has witnessed countless miracles in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and has developed rapidly. Now the people of the whole country are entering socialist society with unparalleled excitement and joy. People like me, who are older than 70, can actually see themselves become citizens of a socialist society. Before I pass away, I still have the opportunity to contribute a little effort. What a joyful, encouraging, and glorious thing! I have been thinking repeatedly: What kind of work can I, an old man with outdated ideas who is far behind the times, do in this rapidly developing new China and new society to serve the people? How can I live up to the concern and expectations of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong? I think that in the past few decades, I have been a person who advocated Chinese martial arts, that is, a person who wanted to promote the restoration and development of Chinese national sports activities. Under the current new situation, I should do more research in this area, provide opinions, and contribute my strength, perhaps playing a role as a screw in the great socialist construction. As everyone knows, Chinese martial arts are a very valuable cultural heritage left to us by our ancestors for thousands of years. It is only because the ruling classes of the past dynasties suspected and feared that the people would develop a sense of self-defense and resistance through practicing martial arts, which would be unfavorable to their reactionary and bloody rule. Therefore, they held a contemptuous and insulting attitude towards martial arts, and even took measures to suppress and destroy them, causing this valuable cultural heritage to fail to develop normally and gradually lose its due status and role in national sports. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I spent a lot of effort and energy to promote Chinese martial arts for more than 20 years, but I did not achieve any results, and I encountered many difficulties and suffered all kinds of unexpected blows. All those who jointly advocated martial arts at that time had the same feeling and expressed great indignation and hatred towards the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    Since the liberation of the mainland and the founding of the People's Republic of China, all construction undertakings in our country, as mentioned earlier, have been advancing by leaps and bounds under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. The cultural cause, that is, the inherent cultural cause left by our ancestors, has also received high attention and rapid development. For example, Chinese medicine and medicine, this legacy of our ancestors, has now gained its due status and is creating a bright future for its development, isn't it? Chinese drama, under Chairman Mao's correct policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," has also gained a glorious position in the literary and art field today, and has further gained many great honors internationally. Therefore, I firmly believe that the time for the revival of Chinese martial arts has come in the great Mao Zedong era, and it must restore its status and play its role in national sports. The current problem is that the vast number of people in the martial arts community must raise their awareness, improve their understanding, transform themselves, study techniques, eliminate sectarian prejudices, establish a spirit of collectivism, eliminate the bad habits of each cherishing their own treasures and keeping them secret, and develop a good atmosphere of mutual observation, mutual learning, and open teaching. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, adhering to Chairman Mao's correct policy of "Develop sports and strengthen the people's physique," everyone should work together to study and sort out this legacy of our ancestors, so that it conforms to the principles of modern science in theory and meets the needs of the broad masses of the people in practice, especially helpful to the sports activities of the broad masses of farmers, because for thousands of years, the rural villagers of China are the most accustomed to and like this kind of national sports activity. Its superiority is economical and convenient, and everyone can participate. We believe that after research and sorting out, Chinese martial arts, under the leadership of the Party and the government, will be promoted and popularized, and will surely be carried forward and developed. It will not only play a huge role in national health and people's physique, but will also contribute to and influence international sports activities. People in the martial arts community across the country should deeply realize that only by doing this can we live up to the great Mao Zedong era; only then can we learn from the advanced comrades in the national sports community, imitate their courage and strength, give full play to our expertise, contribute our due strength, and make good achievements; only then can we, when we reach the socialist threshold and enter socialist society together with the people of the whole country, not come empty-handed, but bring a gift of good news to our great motherland's 600 million people, to our great Chinese Communist Party, and to our great people's leader Chairman Mao Zedong.
    Finally, with a very excited and happy mood, I respectfully wish the conference a successful completion of its tasks, and wish all committee members and comrades good health.

    张之江的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听了周恩来总理的政治报告后，感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞，我衷心地拥护这个报告并愿为这个报告的贯彻实施贡献所有的力量。同时我对李济深副主席关于全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告、郭沫若副主席关于在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告、董必武副主席关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告、陈叔通副主席关于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的报告、陈伯达委员关于中国农业的社会主义改造的报告，都完全同意。从这些重要报告中，在学习上收获不浅，得益处甚大。叫我了解了很多问题，提高了思想认识，今后更要加强学习，努力工作，努力自我改造，以表示我对于这些报告的衷心拥护和全力支持。
    我深深认识到，我们国家这几年来在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明正确领导下，无论是在国内建设和国际活动一切方面都有显著的进步和辉煌的成就。特别是在最近一年来，我们国家在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业上出现了无数奇迹，飞跃地向前发展。现在全国人民都以无比兴奋和愉快的心情跑步进入社会主义社会，像我这样年岁较老超过70岁以上的人们居然也能亲眼看到自己做上了一个社会主义社会的公民，在我去而不返以先还能有机会来贡献一点棉薄力量，这是多么令人欢欣鼓舞和感到无上光荣的幸事！我是再三地想着：像我这样年岁老迈思想陈旧远远落在时代后面的人，我在这个飞跃发展的新中国新社会里，能够做一点什么工作，才算是为人民服务呢？才算是不负中国共产党和毛泽东主席的关怀和期待呢？我想，在以往数十年来，我是一个提倡中国武术的人，也就是要提倡恢复和发展中国民族形式体育活动的一个人。在目前的新形势下，我应该在这一方面来多多研究，提供意见，贡献力量，或许在伟大的社会主义建设中，能起一个螺丝钉作用。人们都知道，中国武术是几千年来我们先人留下来的一个很宝贵的文化遗产。只因历代统治阶级怀疑和恐惧人民由于操练武术，便会产生一种自卫和反抗的力量，便不利于他们的反动血腥统治，因而对于武术都抱着轻视和侮蔑的态度，甚至采取压抑和破坏的手段，致使这一宝贵的文化遗产，不能得到正常的发展，逐渐丧失其在民族体育上应有的地位和作用。国民党反动统治时期，20几年中，我为了提倡中国武术，不知费了许多力，用了许多心，终于没有收到什么效果，而且遭遇到很多困难，受尽了一切意外的打击。凡是当时共同提倡武术的人，都有同感，并对国民党反动派表示极大的愤慨和痛恨。
    自全国大陆解放以后，中华人民共和国成立以来，我们国家的一切建设事业，正如前面所说在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，都是突飞猛进，一日千里。而文化事业，就是我们先人留下来的固有的文化事业，也都得到高度的重视，快速的发展。例如中国医药医学，这个先人遗产，现在不是已获得了应有的地位，并且正在创造其光明发展的前途么？中国戏剧，在毛主席的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的正确方针下，今日也获得了文艺领域上的光荣地位，而且进一步在国际间也得到了很多很大的荣誉。因此，我深深相信，中国武术在伟大的毛泽东时代已经到了它的复兴的时机，而且一定在民族体育运动上，要恢复其地位，发挥其作用。目前的问题就是广大的武术界的人们要提高觉悟，提高认识，改造自己，研究技术，化除宗派门户之见，树立集体主义精神，铲除各怀其宝各秘其密的恶习，养成互相观摩互相学习公开传授的优良风气。在党和政府的领导下，本着毛主席的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的正确方针，大家齐心努力，把这一先人遗产，好好加以研究和整理，使其在理论上合乎现代科学的原则，在实用上适应广大人民的需要，特别是有助于广大农民的体育活动，因为几千年来，中国的农村乡民是最习惯最喜好这种民族形式的体育活动的。他的优越性是经济便利，尽人可能。我们相信中国武术经过研究整理之后，在党和政府领导下，提倡推行，一定可以发扬光大，不仅对于民族健康和人民体质上将要发挥巨大作用，即对于国际体育活动，亦将有所贡献和影响。全国武术界的人们，应该深切认识到我们只有这样做，才算不负于伟大的毛泽东时代；才算是向全国体育界先进同志学习，效法他们的勇健，发挥自己的专长，贡献应有的力量，做出很好的成绩；才算是和全国人民一道到达社会主义门槛进入社会主义社会的时候，不是一双赤手空拳，而是带上了报喜的礼物，献给我们伟大的祖国六亿人民，献给我们伟大的中国共产党，献给我们伟大的人民领袖毛泽东主席。
    最后我以万分兴奋愉快的心情，敬祝大会胜利完成任务，并祝各位委员各位同志身体健康。
