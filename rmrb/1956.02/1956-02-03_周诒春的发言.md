Mr. Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

At this meeting, I listened to Premier Zhou’s political report, Vice Chairman Li Jishen’s report on the work of this committee, President Guo of the Academy of Sciences’ report on “The Mission of Intellectuals in the High Tide of the Socialist Revolution,” Chairman Chen of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce’s report on “The Socialist Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce,” and President Dong of the Supreme People's Court’s report on "The Issue of Eliminating All Counter-Revolutionary Elements." I express my warm approval and heartfelt support for these reports.

I served as an official in the Kuomintang reactionary government for 13 years. At that time, I thought I was doing something for the country and the people, but in fact, I was helping the reactionary government to prolong its life and deceive the people. At the same time, I had illusions about American imperialism, and therefore helped imperialism to expand its influence of various aggressions against our country. I deeply feel that I am guilty before the people, but the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have been very lenient to me, not only not blaming the past, but also inviting me to be a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which makes me feel extremely ashamed and sincerely grateful to the Party and the people.

At the end of 1948, I resigned from my job in the reactionary government. At that time, due to a lack of understanding of the Communist Party's policies and harboring doubts and fears, I went to Hong Kong. While in Hong Kong, I constantly heard good news from the motherland, for example, the prices that had fluctuated drastically for many years stabilized, and the economic situation gradually improved, which made me excited. At the same time, I gained some understanding of the people's democratic united front policy, so I decided to return to the motherland.

After returning to China in November 1950, I saw a series of movements in the new China, such as land reform, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns. China's international status has improved, and the Chinese people have stood up. What moved me most was the moral character of the Chinese people, which had undergone fundamental changes in just a few years. The state promulgated the general line for the transition period, formulated the Constitution, and the first Five-Year Plan is being implemented in earnest. The scale of construction is getting larger and larger, and the speed is getting faster and faster. For me, if I hadn't heard and seen it with my own eyes, this scale and speed would have been unimaginable, and I wouldn't have dared to imagine it. All of this has profoundly educated me and made me realize the brilliance and greatness of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

A few days ago, I read the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956 to 1967 proposed by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and listened to Vice Premier Chen Yi's report, which made me more deeply appreciate Chairman Mao's foresight and boldness. The Party and Chairman Mao had already indicated in the past that the socialist transformation of agriculture is one of the two wings of socialist industrialization, and it is also a necessary condition for improving the material and cultural life of the people. In this program, specific plans for the development of agricultural production are further proposed, not only stipulating plans for agricultural collectivization and increased agricultural production, but also formulating detailed plans for rural cultural education, medical and health care, and living conditions. I fully support this grand and well-thought-out plan. Based on what I have seen and heard in recent years, I believe that under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and through the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, it is entirely possible to realize this plan.

Since I served as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and Minister of Health in the reactionary government, I have had many thoughts when reading this program. Comparing the new with the old has given me a deeper understanding of the fundamental differences between the new people's government and the old reactionary government. At that time, I also had some fantasies, such as encouraging farmers to plant trees and forests on a small scale to conserve water and soil, or improving rural health work within a small scope, etc. Now it seems that these fantasies are really insignificant. Even such small plans were not realized. The reason why the reactionary government set up departments related to the people's lives, such as agriculture, forestry, and health, was originally to decorate the facade, not to truly care about the people's welfare and life. At that time, some people privately referred to these departments as "cold departments." This shows that they were nominal and not real, and also shows the reactionary government's indifference to the people.

Recently, the Chinese Communist Party has put forward a plan for training senior intellectuals. Because I have had more or less contact with scientific and technological intellectuals in the past, I also have some thoughts on this aspect. Today, socialist construction has put forward new tasks to scientific and technological intellectuals—huge and glorious tasks! The Party and the government are prepared to vigorously find ways to give scientific and technological workers full help and support, and further unite them, transform them, and ask them to play a greater role. Under such conditions, scientific and technological workers can and will surely achieve major achievements in their work. Speaking of this, I cannot help but recall the situation before liberation. In the past, our country did have many patriotic scientific and technological intellectuals, who fantasized about "saving the country with science" and "saving the country with industry," but under the reactionary regime, this was impossible to realize. As a result, most people tended to be disappointed and inevitably depressed. Even if a few people were lucky enough to hide in the laboratory to do some work and achieve some achievements, these achievements were very difficult to get out of the laboratory and put into practice, so they could not play any role for the country and the people. Today, large-scale construction undertakings in all aspects of the country are developing vigorously, and scientific and technological research is no longer as futile as it used to be. As long as there is an invention, big or small, even small improvements will be adopted and promoted by the people. The Party and the government have always shown cordial concern and strong support for scientific and technological intellectuals. In this regard, they certainly understand it much more deeply than I do. I believe that domestic scientific and technological intellectuals will further accept the leadership of the Party and the government, work harder, strengthen research, and contribute their greatest strength to serve socialist construction. I also hope that scientific and technological intellectuals in Taiwan and abroad can dispel unnecessary concerns, overcome all difficulties, and strive to return to the country as soon as possible to participate in the great construction of the motherland, which will surely be welcomed by the country and the people.

Capitalism is bound to perish, and socialism is bound to win. This is the law of social development. Our country's socialist construction is advancing at a speed of a thousand miles a day. I am 74 years old, and I deeply feel the happiness of being able to see the arrival of socialism. In the future, I am willing to follow you all, learn humbly, strive for progress, and, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of everyone, loyally contribute my remaining strength to the socialist construction cause of our country.

    周诒春的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在这次会议上我听到周总理的政治报告，李济深副主席的本会工作的报告，科学院郭院长的“在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命”的报告，工商联陈主任委员的“关于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造”的报告和最高人民法院董院长的“关于肃清一切反革命分子问题”的报告，我对这些报告，表示热诚的赞同和衷心的拥护。
    我曾在国民党反动政府做过13年的官，那时我自己还以为是在为国家为人民做点事情，但客观事实上却是帮助了反动政府苟延残喘，蒙蔽了人民。同时，我对美帝国主义曾抱有幻想，因此也帮助了帝国主义扩大它对我国各种侵略的影响。我深深感到在人民面前我是有罪的，但中国共产党和中国人民对我非常宽大，不但不究既往，还邀我为中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员，使我感到万分惭愧，也衷心感激党和人民。
    1948年末，我辞去了反动政府的工作。当时，由于不了解共产党的政策，心存疑惧，所以就到香港去了。在香港的时候，不断地听到祖国传来的好消息，例如，多年剧烈波动的物价平稳了，经济情况逐渐好转，使我感到兴奋。同时，对于人民民主统一战线政策有了一些认识，因此我决心回到祖国。
    1950年11月回国以后，看到了新中国的土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、三反五反等一系列的运动。中国的国际地位提高了，中国人民站起来了。最使我感动的是中国人民的道德品质，在短短的几年内，有了根本的改变。国家颁布了过渡时期的总路线，制定了宪法，第一个五年计划又在切实地进行，建设的规模愈来愈大，速度愈来愈快，对我来讲，假如不是亲自耳闻目睹，这种规模和速度是不能想像，也不敢想像的。这一切深刻地教育了我，使我认识到中国共产党和毛主席的英明和伟大。
    前几天读到了中共中央政治局提出的1956到1967年全国农业发展纲要，又听了陈毅副总理的报告，使我更深切地体会到毛主席的远见和气魄。党和毛主席在过去早已指示过，农业社会主义改造是社会主义工业化两翼之一，也是提高人民物质及文化生活的必要条件。在这个纲要中，更进一步提出了发展农业生产的具体规划，不仅规定了农业合作化和农业增产的规划，而且对农村的文化教育、医药卫生，居住条件等都制定了详尽的规划。这个规模宏伟，考虑周密的规划，我是完全拥护的。根据最近几年来所见所闻，我相信，在党和毛主席的领导下，通过全国人民的共同努力，实现这个规划是完全可能的。
    由于我在反动政府做过农林部长和卫生部长，这就使我在读到这个纲要时发生不少感想。将新比旧，使我对新的人民政权和旧的反动政权的根本不同，有了更深刻的认识。那时我也曾有些空想，例如：鼓励农民小规模地植树造林以保持水土，或者在一个不大的范围内改善农村卫生工作等等。现在看来，这些空想真是微不足道。即使像那样小的计划，也未能实现。反动政府之所以设立与人民生活密切有关的农林卫生等部门，原是为了点缀门面，并不是真正关心人民的福利和生活。那时有些人在私下谈话时通称这些部门为“冷部”。可见其有名无实，也可见反动政府对人民漠不关心。
    最近中国共产党提出了培养高级知识分子的规划。由于我过去曾和科学技术知识分子或多或少地有所接触，在这方面我也有些感想。今天社会主义建设向科学技术知识分子提出了新的任务——巨大的、光荣的任务！党和政府准备大力设法给科学技术工作者以充分的帮助和支持，并进一步地团结他们、改造他们、要求他们发挥更大的作用。在这样的条件下，科学技术工作者才有可能而且一定会在工作中取得重大的成就。谈到这里，我不能不回忆到解放前的情况。过去，我国确有很多爱国的科学技术知识分子，他们幻想“科学救国”、“工业救国”，但在反动政权下，这是不可能实现的。于是大多数人都趋于失望，不免消沉。纵有少数人比较幸运，还能躲在研究室里做一些工作，多少有些成就，但这些成就很不容易越出研究室大门，见之实施，因此对国家、对人民起不了什么作用。今天全国各方面规模宏大的建设事业正在蓬勃地开展着，科学技术的研究已不再像从前那样徒劳无功了。只要有所发明，大的不待说，就是小的改进也会被人民所采用和推广。党和政府一向亲切地关怀和大力地支持科学技术知识分子。在这方面，他们当然体会得比我深刻得多。我相信国内科学技术知识分子一定会进一步接受党和政府的领导，更加努力、加强研究、贡献自己最大的力量，为社会主义建设服务。我还希望在台湾和在国外的科学技术知识分子能够解除不必要的顾虑，克服一切困难，争取早日回国，参加祖国的伟大建设事业，这一定会受到国家和人民的欢迎。
    资本主义必然灭亡，社会主义必然胜利，这是社会发展的规律。我国社会主义建设事业正以一日千里的速度向前迈进。我年已74岁，深深感到能够看到社会主义到来的幸福。今后我还愿意追随诸位，虚心学习，力求进步，在党的领导和大家的帮助下，忠诚地为我们国家的社会主义建设事业贡献出我有生的力量。
