    Shenyang, February 22nd (By our reporter) More than 10,800 workers in state-owned factories in Shenyang have exceeded the new national quotas for this year from the beginning of the year to February 21st.
    Workers in the 1A62 workshop of the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant have generally exceeded the planned quotas, and more than 60% of the workers in the assembly section have further exceeded the design quotas. The man-hours required to assemble each 1A62 lathe are now 16% lower than the design man-hours. After the small shaft section of this workshop implemented high-speed cutting, the entire section exceeded the design quota, and production efficiency increased by 130%. The workers who have exceeded the planned quota in Shenyang Water Pump Factory already account for more than 41% of the total number of workers in the factory. Zheng Yongen, a worker in the tool workshop of this factory, used the Soviet Kuzovkin cutting tool method, which shortened the time for processing each 60 cm round part from 20 minutes to 20 seconds. More than 90% of the workers in the metalworking workshop of Shenyang Transformer Factory have exceeded the quota; lathe operator Liu Ruishen creatively used the single-blade six-edge operation method to process six processes at the same time, increasing production efficiency by six and a half times. Workers who exceeded the quota in the Shenyang Railway Administration Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory accounted for 88% of the total number of workers in the factory. 69% of the processes in the assembly workshop of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory have also completely exceeded the quota.
