    Strengthen the Storage of Cotton, Hemp, and Tobacco
    Li Yaxuan

    The progress of cotton, hemp, and tobacco purchases this year is faster than in previous years, and the inventory in various places has increased sharply. Doing a good job in the warehousing and storage of these materials is a very arduous task.

    Party and government leading organs in many regions attach importance to this work. The defense departments and warehouses of many purchasing units have adopted the method of merging offices to strengthen the leadership of this work. Many warehouses have improved fire-fighting organizations and conducted fire drills; many warehouse cadres have persisted in night shifts regardless of wind or rain.

    However, some relevant staff in many regions have serious paralyzing and slackening thoughts regarding the storage of these materials, specifically manifested in the unsoundness of storage and security organizations, the inability of fire-fighting equipment and storage tasks to adapt, and the safety system that has been established becoming a mere formality. According to the results of inspections, the fire-fighting equipment in many warehouses in the Liaocheng area of Shandong Province is very poor. Some fire prevention team leaders do not even know how many people are in their team or who they are. The Tangyi County Cotton Receiving Station even pressed its only fire-fighting equipment – a large water tank – under a cotton pile. Some processing factories do not clean up waste cotton and lint in a timely manner, and some have not established a cleaning system at all. Waste cotton and lint are extremely easy to ignite and spread fire. Bad elements take advantage of the negligence of these staff members and try their best to carry out sabotage. In Binhai County, Jiangsu Province, eight major cotton ginning factories successively experienced four politically motivated sabotage accidents within three days from December 18th to 21st last year.

    During the Spring Festival, farmers have the habit of setting off firecrackers. Storage and guard personnel in various places should pay extra attention, strictly prevent bad elements from carrying out sabotage, strengthen fire prevention organizations, and improve various safety responsibility systems, especially the inspection system. It is necessary to immediately add and repair fire-fighting equipment according to needs, and carefully remove flammable materials such as straw ropes, wood flowers, waste paper, and floor sweepings in warehouses, freight yards, and processing factories. Secondly, it is also necessary to continuously improve the technical storage of materials according to the characteristics of the materials and warehouse conditions to prevent the occurrence of mold and deterioration accidents of the above-mentioned technical crops. Be sure to diligently turn over stacks, diligently clean stacks, and check the humidity and temperature of materials at any time. If moldy materials are found, they should be dealt with in a timely manner, and resolutely eliminate man-made excess losses.

    加强棉、麻、烟的保管工作
    李雅轩
    今年收购棉、麻、烟的进度比往年快，各地的库存数量骤然增大。作好这些物资的仓储保管工作，是一项十分艰巨的任务。
    许多地区的党、政领导机关对这项工作是重视的。不少收购单位的保卫部门和仓库采取了合并办公的办法，加强了这一工作的领导。许多仓库都改进了消防组织，进行了消防演习；许多仓库干部不管刮风、下雨，都坚持了夜间值班制度。
    但是，也有不少地区的有关工作人员，对于这些物资的保管工作，存在着严重的麻痹松懈思想，具体地表现在保管和保卫组织不健全，消防设备和仓储任务不能适应，已经建立的安全制度流于形式。根据检查的结果，山东聊城地区不少仓库的消防设备都很差，有的防火组长甚至不知道自己组内有多少人，是哪些人。堂邑县收棉站竟把仅有的消防设备——太平水缸压在棉垛底下。有些加工厂清理废棉、飞絮不及时，有的根本没有建立清扫制度，而废棉、飞絮是极易引火和蔓延的。而坏分子就钻这些工作人员麻痹大意的空子，想尽各种办法进行破坏。江苏省滨海县8大家轧花厂去年12月18日至21日3天内就连续发生政治性的破坏事故四起。
    在春节期间，农民有燃放鞭炮的习惯，各地仓储和警卫人员应该加倍注意，严防坏分子进行破坏，加强防火组织，健全各种安全责任制度，特别是检查制度。要根据需要，立即增添和修理消防用具，认真清除仓库、货场、加工厂中的草绳、木花、废纸、地脚花等易引火物。其次，还要根据物资特性和仓库条件，不断改进物资技术保管工作，防止发生上述技术作物的霉烂变质事故。一定要勤翻垛、勤清垛，随时检查物资的湿度、温度，发现霉变物资，及时加以处理，坚决消灭人为的超额损耗。
