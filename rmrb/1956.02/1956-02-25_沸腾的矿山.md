    The Boiling Mine
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    The initiative of Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui in boldly reforming coal mining methods, which has more than doubled efficiency, has aroused profound repercussions among the broad masses of workers in Liaoning Province. Therefore, we went to visit the Laohutai Coal Mine, where this initiative originated. In the Party Committee office, the mine director's office, and the trade union chairman's office, we saw people constantly coming and going with drawings and suggestions.
    The Party Secretary is a very thin but energetic and enthusiastic person. He told us: "In just one month, more than 1,500 rationalization proposals have emerged, and these proposals all address major, long-standing problems that have not been resolved, offering relatively mature and fundamental solutions. Therefore, the implementation of these proposals has immediately yielded huge results, which is an unprecedented phenomenon."
    The Party Secretary told us that these suggestions from the masses are not all new ideas conceived today. The reason why these suggestions have only been put forward now and are being realized is mainly due to serious right-leaning conservative thinking on the part of the leadership, which clings to outdated procedures and shackles the hands and feet of the masses. Chairman Mao's call was like a clap of spring thunder, encouraging workers and technicians to boldly break through outdated rules and regulations. The initiative of coal miners Pang Guanxiang and technician Zhou Guangrui was the first torch in this profound struggle. The Party organization and administrative leadership took the initiative to lead and enthusiastically supported this bold reform. This event encouraged people to more bravely and boldly wage a struggle against all conservative ideas. In every corner of the mine, various rationalization proposals emerged like a storm.
    In the Fushun Mining Area, there are unusually thick coal seams, some tens of meters thick. For decades, the mining method used was to mine only about two meters at a time, mining one layer and then another. Following Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui, the Seventh Mining District of Laohutai also proposed a bold new method: changing the original method of mining one layer at a time to mining two layers simultaneously, pushing forward simultaneously like terraces. In the past, when mining only one layer, coal mining had to be stopped to carry out filling after one layer was mined, and production was intermittent. At the same time, more than 20 people were squeezed into a narrow working face, unable to stretch their hands and often idling. Using two layers of simultaneous mining can avoid these shortcomings. When the upper layer is filled, the workers mine in the lower layer, and when the lower layer is filled, they mine in the upper layer. If you can't get a hand in on this working face, you can move to another working face. The results of the experiment in early February showed that the daily output of each coal miner increased from 4.6 tons to 8.42 tons, and savings of 1.4 million yuan could be achieved in materials, depreciation, and maintenance costs alone. This method is of great significance for accelerating the speed of thick seam mining.
    With the acceleration of coal mining speed, the tunneling staff also considered how to catch up with the tunneling work. In the process of figuring out a solution, the technicians in the gas tunneling area discovered a strange phenomenon: sometimes, many people were on duty and completed the task, and sometimes, few people were on duty and also completed the task; sometimes 4 people did more work than 6 people. What was the reason? After studying the 10 procedures stipulated in the regular tunneling cycle, he found that three of the procedures were all for auxiliary preparatory work. Because the auxiliary work and the production work were arranged together, the work face was intermittent, and even if the entire regular cycle operation was realized, the utilization rate of the work face was only 12 hours per day. If the production procedures and auxiliary procedures could be carried out separately, wouldn't it be possible to greatly accelerate the speed of tunneling? Based on this opinion, he proposed changing the three-shift system to a four-shift system.
    When people at the mine first heard this suggestion, they felt a little strange:
    "Have you heard? When you calculate it, it's still 24 hours a day, but they want to do 32 hours of work?"
    "Oh my god, what's this all about?..."
    In fact, it is not strange to work 32 hours a day. The principle is very simple: When the first shift works to the 6th hour, the second shift goes down the well and works with the previous shift at the same time, completing all the auxiliary preparatory work in two hours. After the previous shift gets off work, they go to the working face and work until they get off work. The third shift is also done in this way. From then on, the working face is no longer intermittent, but always carrying out tunneling work. The results of the experiment in Group 913 showed that the group's daily tunneling increased from 2.4 meters to 5.58 meters, more than doubling the speed.
    With the acceleration of coal mining and tunneling speed, it is particularly necessary to do a better job of safety work. How can we do a better job of safety work? Ding Yishan, a veteran miner with more than 30 years of experience and head of the Fifth Mining District, considered this issue. As early as 1953, he discovered that there was a gap of more than one meter between the "duckbill canopy" and the coal wall, where there were no canopies, and rocks and coal blocks were most likely to fall, and most of the roof fall accidents in the past occurred here. However, for more than 40 years, Fushun has been erecting canopies in this way. He erected two "side-supported canopies" at the "big loophole." However, the inspector said that he "violated operating procedures," and the mine director also criticized him for "taking the lead in violating rules and regulations." This reform was thus aborted. Chairman Mao's instructions rekindled his confidence, and he was determined to continue to complete this reform. He designed a drawing of a connected, close-fitting canopy, and at the same time changed the old-style prop canopy into a connected prop canopy. This can not only ensure safety, but also save one-third of the pit timber. In order to make this proposal more perfect, he consulted and researched with more than 20 veteran workers before and after. The Party and the administration enthusiastically supported this reform. In late January, this new canopy method was successfully tested and technically appraised. According to calculations, after the promotion throughout the mine, more than 6,000 cubic meters of pit timber and more than 12,000 man-hours can be saved throughout the year. More importantly, the safety of workers has been reliably guaranteed. This new method will be widely promoted throughout the Fushun Mining Area.
    At Laohutai, every 50 meters of coal mined requires leaving 5 meters of "section coal pillars," which means that about 12%-15% of the coal is discarded. This problem has not been solved for a long time. However, now there is also a solution. This method was proposed by Cong Xiuyan, a young technician who had only been out of school for two years. In October last year, he proposed a suggestion on solving this problem, but unfortunately, it was suppressed by the technical leaders. After seeing that the Party Committee enthusiastically supported the innovations of Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui, he ran to the technical leader and took back the suggestion and sent it to the Party Committee. The suggestion is to use a 0.2-meter-thick cement false roof to replace the "section coal pillars," so that the discarded coal can be mined, and the coal recovery rate can be increased from 76% to about 90%, while the increased cost is not very high. After promoting this method throughout the mine, the mining life can be extended by more than 20 years. After promoting this method throughout the Fushun Mining Area, it is equivalent to adding two large-scale wells with an annual output of 1 million tons that can be mined for 50 years without investment, and a large amount of coal can be utilized!
    In order to cooperate with improving coal mining efficiency, the electromechanical department manufactured a kind of movable drill bit, which can double the efficiency of drilling coal eyes. In order to reduce the physical labor of coal loading workers, repair worker Zhao Jingfang designed a small coal loading machine, which can double efficiency. In order to improve the underground pumping capacity, technician Yang Shouye improved the water pump, so that the pumping of water per minute increased from 6 cubic meters to 7 cubic meters. Many valuable suggestions have also emerged in the administrative affairs department, such as changing the situation of queuing for medical treatment and working overtime.
    The high enthusiasm of the masses is changing the face of the mine with an unstoppable force. As the chairman of the mine trade union said: "The current situation is changing every day, and changing every hour. The numbers we calculated in the morning are not completely reliable by the afternoon." What was considered impossible not long ago has become possible in a few days; what was originally impossible to do can now not only be done, but can be done even more. Laohutai Mine's task this year has increased by 30% compared with last year. Before the New Year, everyone was worried about the lack of manpower, but now it seems that even if one-third of the people are drawn out, it is still no problem to complete the task.

    沸腾的矿山

    庞观祥和周广瑞大胆改革采煤方法，提高效率一倍以上的创举，已经在辽宁省广大职工中引起深刻的反响。因此，我们去访问产生这个创举的老虎台煤矿。在党委会、矿长室、工会主席办公室里，我们看到人们不断地拿着图纸、建议走进来走出去。
    党委书记是个很瘦但是精力充沛而又热情的人。他告诉我们说：“在短短的一个月中，就出现了1，500多件合理化建议，而且这些建议都是对一些重大的、长期得不到解决的问题，提出比较成熟的根本的解决办法，所以，推行了这些建议马上就得到巨大的效果，这是从来没有过的现象。”
    党委书记告诉我们说，群众的这些建议并不都是今天才想出来的，这些建议所以到现在才提出来，并且得到实现，这主要是领导上有严重的右倾保守思想，抓住过了时的规程不放，束缚了群众的手足。毛主席的号召像一声春雷，鼓励职工和技术人员大胆地冲破过了时的清规戒律。采煤工人庞观祥和技术员周广瑞的创举，就是这个深刻的斗争中的第一个火炬。党组织和行政领导主动地领导，热情地支持了这个大胆的改革。这件事鼓舞人们更加勇敢、大胆地同一切保守思想展开斗争。在全矿每一个角落各种合理化建议就像狂风暴雨般地涌现出来了。
    在抚顺矿区，到处都是举世少有的数十公尺的厚煤层。几十年来所用的开采方法都是一次采二公尺左右，采了一层再采一层。继庞观祥、周广瑞之后，老虎台第七采区又提出了一个大胆的新方法；就是把原来一层一层开采的方法，改为两层同时开采，像台级那样一前一后同时往前推。过去只采一层的时候，采完一层就要停止采煤进行充填，生产是间断地进行着的；同时20多个人挤在一个狭窄掌子面上，伸不开手，常常窝工。采用两层同时开采，就可以避免这些缺点，上层充填的时候，工人就在下层采煤，下层充填就在上层采煤；你在这个工作面插不上手，就可以转到另一个工作面去。2月上旬试验结果，每个采煤工人的日产量就由4.6吨提高到8.42吨；仅材料、折旧、维持费用就可节约140万元。这个办法对加快厚煤层采煤速度有很大意义。
    采煤速度加快了，掘进的工作人员也考虑如何才能把掘进工作赶上去。瓦斯掘进区的技术员在想办法的过程中，发现一个奇怪的现象：有时候，出勤的人很多，完成了任务，有时候出勤的人很少，也同样的完成了任务；有时候4个人干的活比6个人干的还多。原因在哪里？他逐道研究了掘进正规循环作业所规定的10道工序以后，发现有三道工序全是做辅助准备工作的，因为辅助工作和生产工作排在一起，就使工作面工作断断续续，即使全部实现了正规循环作业，工作面每天的利用率也不过12小时。如果能够把生产工序和辅助工序分头进行，不就可以大大加快掘进的速度了吗？根据这个意见，他提出了改三班制为四班制的建议。
    矿上的人刚听到这个建议的时候，都感到有些奇怪：
    “你听说过吗？一天算来算去也还是24小时，他们却要干32小时的活？”
    “天哪，这是什么名堂呀？……”
    实际一天干32小时活并不奇怪，道理也很简单：第一班干到第6小时，第二班就下井跟上一班同时干活，在两个钟头中把全部辅助准备工作干完，待上一班下班后，就到工作面上一直干到下班。第三班也是这样干法。从此工作面上就不是断断续续，而是永远不停地在进行掘进工作。这个办法在913小组进行试验结果，小组每日就由掘进2.4公尺提高到5.58公尺，速度提高了一倍以上。
    采煤和掘进速度都加快了，就特别需要把安全工作做得更好。如何能把安全工作做得更好呢？30多年的老矿工、第五采区区长丁义山考虑这个问题。早在1953年他就发现了在鸭嘴棚子和煤壁之间有一公尺多的空顶，这里没有棚子，岩石和煤块最容易掉下来，过去的冒顶事故也大都发生在这里。但是，抚顺40多年来一直都是这样搭棚子的。他在“大漏洞”处架设了两架“靠帮棚子”。可是检查员说他“违反操作规程”，矿长也批评他“带头违反规程制度”。这项改革就这样夭折了。毛主席的指示又重新鼓起了他的信心，他决心继续完成这项改革。他设计了一个连接式贴帮棚子的图样，同时又把旧式擎口棚子改为连接式的擎口棚子。这样不仅可以保证安全，而且可以节省坑木三分之一。他为了使这个建议更加完善，前后同20多个老工人商量、研究。党和行政热情地支持了这个改革，在1月下旬，这个新的架棚方法经过试验和技术鉴定，就成功了。据计算，全矿推广后，全年就可节约坑木6千多立方公尺和1万2千多人工。更重要的是工人的安全得到了可靠的保障。这个新方法将在全抚顺矿区普遍推广。
    在老虎台，每采50公尺煤，就要留下5公尺的“段间煤柱”，即约有12％—15％的煤被丢掉。这个问题长期解决不了。但是，现在也有了解决的办法。这个办法是由一个离学校才二年的青年技术员丛秀岩提出来的。在去年10月，他就提出过关于解决这个问题的建议，不幸，被技术领导人员压下来了。他看到党委热情支持了庞观祥和周广瑞的革新后，就跑到那位技术领导人员那里，把那份建议取了回来送到党委会去。这个建议就是用0.2公尺厚的水泥假顶来代替“段间煤柱”，这样就可把丢下的煤炭采出来，煤的回采率就可由76％提高到90％左右，而所增加的成本并不很多。全矿推广这个办法后，就可延长开采寿命20多年，全抚顺矿区推广这个办法后，就等于不用投资增加两个可以开采50年的年产100万吨的大型井，并且使大量煤炭得以利用！
    为了配合提高采煤效率，机电部门制造了一种活动钎头，可使钻煤眼的效率提高一倍。为了减轻装煤工人的体力劳动，修理工人赵景芳设计了一种小型装煤机，可提高效率一倍。为提高井下抽水能力，技术员杨守业改进了水泵，使每分钟抽水由6立方公尺提高到7立方公尺。在行政事务部门也出现了许多宝贵的建议，如改变看病排队、加班加点的情况等。
    群众高涨的积极性正以猛不可挡的力量改变矿山的面貌。正如矿工会主席所说：“现在的情况一天一个变化，一小时一个变化，我们上午统计的数字，到下午就不完全可靠了”。不久前还认为不可能的事情，几天后就变成可能了；本来办不到的事情，现在不仅能办到，而且能够办得更多。老虎台矿今年任务较去年增加了30％。年前大家还担心人力不足，可是现在看来，就是抽出三分之一的人来，完成任务还是不成问题的。
