    A Road Built by the Masses Themselves
    Liu Song
    In the densely forested valleys east of Simao County, Yunnan Province, a new road built by the masses themselves has emerged. This road is only 15 li (7.5 km) long, but it was built spontaneously by the farmers here to welcome the good days of socialism.

    Since 1952, Yibai District of Simao County has been developing agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations. By last year, 43 agricultural production cooperatives had been established. After the autumn harvest last year, the cooperative members firmly requested to merge 12 small cooperatives into one large cooperative of 346 households. At the same time, they requested the County People's Committee to allow them to build a road to the county seat, so as to send public grain to support national construction, and transport agricultural machinery to the cooperative. The Simao County People's Committee agreed to their request, allocated 7,000 yuan, and sent technicians to help them.

    On November 21st, the road to the county seat started construction. Under the leadership of the Yibai District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the agricultural production cooperative members formed the main force and began the road construction work. Originally, it was stipulated that the elderly, women with nursing babies, and children would not participate in the road construction work, but this regulation was broken by people's socialist enthusiasm. Along with some young and middle-aged people building the road, there were also elderly people in their 60s, children of thirteen or fourteen years old, and some mothers with children. Li Linshi, a 56-year-old poor peasant cooperative member, even signed up to join the shock team. She said: "The sooner the road is built, the sooner socialism will arrive." On this road construction site, if you ask anyone, they all know the significance of building this road. They said: "Dazhai Township alone needs to send more than 1 million jin (500 tons) of public grain to the county seat. If people carry it, it will take 18 days; if transported by car, it will be delivered in a few days." "After the road is open, industrial products can be transported in time." "More importantly, tractors can also be driven in!"

    The cooperative members demonstrated a high degree of initiative in the road construction process. They created many advanced working methods such as "shoulder-carrying flying earth" and "cradle-dumping earth." While working hard, they happily sang: "Higher on one side, lower on the other. Digging it up one platform at a time; after this road is built, collective farms will be established."

    On December 25th, the large cooperative in Dazhai Township was established, and the road was officially opened to traffic. More than 1,300 people in the whole district held a warm celebration meeting, celebrating another step towards socialism.

### 一条群众自己修筑的公路

    一条群众自己修筑的公路
    柳松
    在云南省思茅县城东边森林密集的山谷里，新出现了一条群众自己修筑的公路。这条公路全长才15华里，但它是这里的农民为了迎接社会主义的好日子而自动修起来的。
    思茅县倚百区从1952年开始发展农业生产互助合作组织，到去年已经建立了43个农业生产合作社。去年秋后，社员们坚决要求把12个小社合成一个346户的大社，同时请求县人民委员会允许他们修一条通往县城的公路，以便送公粮支援国家建设，并把农业机器等运到社里来。思茅县人民委员会答应了他们的请求，并且拨款7，000元和派出技术员帮助他们。
    11月21日，通往县城的公路开工了。在中共倚百区委会的领导下，以农业生产合作社社员为主力军，展开了修筑公路的工作。原来规定老人、有吃奶孩子的妇女和小孩不参加筑路工作，但是这个规定被人们的社会主义热情冲破了。随着一些青壮年修路的，还有60多岁的老人，十三、四岁的小孩，以及一些带孩子的母亲。56岁的贫农社员李林氏，还报名参加了突击队。她说：“公路早修好一天，社会主义就早一天到来。”在这筑路工地上，随便问哪一个人，他们都知道修这公路的意义。他们说：“只大寨乡应该送往县城的公粮，就有100多万斤，人挑，要用18天；用汽车运，几天就送完了。”“公路修通以后，工业品可以及时运到。”“更要紧的是，拖拉机也可以开来了！”
    社员们在筑路过程中发挥了高度的积极性。他们创造了“肩挑飞土”、“摇篮倒土”等不少先进的工作方法。他们一面紧张地工作着，一面高兴地唱着：“高一台，低一台。一台一台挖起来；这条公路修通后，集体农庄办起来。”
    12月25日，大寨乡的大社办起来了，公路也正式通车了。全区1，300多人举行了热烈的庆祝大会，庆祝又向社会主义迈进了一步。
