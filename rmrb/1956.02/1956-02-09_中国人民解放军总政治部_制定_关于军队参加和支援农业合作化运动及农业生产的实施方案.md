The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in order to mobilize the entire army to fully support the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" proposed by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee for the period from 1956 to 1967, has formulated the "Implementation Plan for the Army's Participation in and Support of the Agricultural Cooperative Movement and Agricultural Production." The plan instructs the entire army that, in addition to strengthening training, accelerating the modernization of the army, actively combating Chiang Kai-shek's military harassment activities, actively preparing to liberate Taiwan, resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and vigilantly defending the socialist construction of the motherland, it should also do everything possible to use the gaps in combat and training to work with the people of the whole country to complete every task proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program.

The "Implementation Plan for the Army's Participation in and Support of the Agricultural Cooperative Movement and Agricultural Production" contains 20 articles. The contents are as follows:

	I. Continue to mobilize and organize all officers and soldiers to continuously write letters to their families, relatives, and friends, mobilizing and encouraging them to take the socialist road. For those who have already joined cooperatives, encourage them to abide by labor discipline, strive to increase production, and become active members of the cooperatives; for those who have not yet joined, persuade them to join cooperatives as soon as possible. Workers should be encouraged to exert greater enthusiasm and creativity, participate in socialist labor competitions, improve labor efficiency, and complete and overfulfill production tasks. Handicraft workers and various independent laborers should be persuaded to obey national plans and take the road of cooperation. The bourgeoisie should be persuaded to recognize the laws of social development, abandon exploitation, accept transformation, and become self-reliant laborers, striving to become active participants in the transformation. Landlords and rich peasants should be persuaded to abide by government decrees, abandon exploitation, work hard, and accept transformation.

	II. In areas where it is necessary for the army to temporarily deploy cadres to participate in the establishment and rectification of cooperatives (especially in areas liberated later, as well as border areas, islands, and minority areas), the army party committee should take the initiative to solicit the opinions of the local party committee and deploy a group of officers and soldiers to form a work team. Under the unified leadership of the local party committee, after training, they will help carry out agricultural cooperation or other socialist transformation work. In addition, the army should plan to transfer a group of officers suitable for local work to local work every year to support the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation work.

	III. Mobilize all military personnel to practice thrift, oppose extravagance and waste, strictly implement the financial and grain system, cherish weapons and equipment, and cherish public property, doing everything possible to save the country more money for socialist construction. Officers and soldiers living in rural areas should be encouraged to save money and send it home to invest in cooperatives as a fund for the development of cooperative production. All officers should be mobilized to actively subscribe to national economic construction bonds and assist local banks in carrying out the "patriotic savings campaign" in the army in order to accumulate funds for the country's socialist construction.

	IV. Within three years from 1956 to 1958, the army will raise funds and select various technical personnel from among demobilized personnel to establish 30 tractor stations (5 large tractor stations that can cultivate 200,000 mu of land, 10 medium-sized tractor stations that can cultivate 100,000 mu of land, and 15 small tractor stations that can cultivate 50,000 mu of land) to support agricultural production. After these tractor stations are built, they will be handed over to the agricultural sector for distribution and use. It is estimated that in 1956, 2 large, 3 medium, and 5 small tractor stations will be established; in 1957, 2 large, 3 medium, and 5 small tractor stations will be established; and in 1958, 1 large, 4 medium, and 5 small tractor stations will be established.

	V. Implement a system of compulsory labor for supporting socialist construction. All units, military organs, and schools should, according to their different circumstances, contact the local party committee and people's committee, and within one year, set aside a number of working days to participate in local socialist construction in a planned way, and ensure that each person averages 5 to 7 compulsory labor days per year. Troops stationed in rural areas should mainly help agricultural production cooperatives carry out various agricultural labors and participate in water conservancy projects, building dikes, building roads, and reclaiming wasteland; troops stationed in cities should mainly help with various municipal construction projects.

	VI. Mobilize and organize all military personnel to actively participate in the activities of eliminating the four pests (rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes) during extracurricular activities and holidays. It is required that all army barracks basically eliminate the four pests within this year. The army should also be organized to help the masses near the驻地 eliminate the four pests. Whenever residents near the army's station launch activities to eliminate other harmful animals, harmful birds, and harmful insects, the army must actively participate. The various conscription bureaus can also organize militias to encircle mountains and eliminate harmful animals within a certain period of time. While eliminating harmful insects, harmful birds, and harmful animals, all military personnel should be educated to pay attention to protecting beneficial insects, beneficial birds, and beneficial animals.

	VII. Actively participate in afforestation activities. Within the two years of 1956 and 1957, the surroundings of army barracks and schools should be completely greened. When the army builds roads and railways, trees should also be planted on both sides of the roads. In military defense zones, afforestation should also be done as much as possible, provided that it does not hinder shooting. In addition, the army should set aside a certain amount of manpower to assist local afforestation according to the unified plan of the local government. Coastal troops should actively participate in the construction and protection of national defense shelterbelts. Forest protection troops and troops stationed near forests should pay attention to the protection of forests and extinguish forest fires at any time.

	VIII. Troops stationed in rural areas and urban suburbs should negotiate with the local people's committees or cooperatives to accumulate all human and animal manure and hand it over to the cooperatives for use.

	IX. The army should regularly sweep away garbage together with local residents to maintain the cleanliness and hygiene of the surrounding environment. Health workers in the troops should conduct one to two health knowledge and disease prevention common sense publicity campaigns every month, focusing on the health conditions of the surrounding military and civilians, and assist residents in preventing infectious diseases and various diseases that seriously endanger the people; when epidemics occur, quarantine and disinfection should be implemented to quickly eliminate the epidemics. Health companies, health battalions, clinics, and hospitals of all troops should provide outpatient or home visits for acute diseases for members of agricultural production cooperatives, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and disabled soldiers in the surrounding area of the station.

	X. The army should actively participate in the protection and reproduction of livestock and strictly prohibit the slaughter of draft animals and young animals. Army veterinarians should set aside special time every month to help local cooperatives carry out livestock epidemic prevention and disease treatment, and can also help cooperatives train veterinarians. The army's retired military horses can be uniformly handed over to the local people's committee for distribution to agricultural production cooperatives. Except for troops stationed in cities, all troops stationed in rural areas and small towns should raise pigs on the principle of not wasting food, requiring that one pig be raised for every 50 people all year round.

	XI. When natural disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, wind, and hail occur in the army's station, or when dangerous situations occur, the stationed troops should, under the unified leadership of the local party committee and people's committee, do everything possible to assist the people in disaster relief, and strive to overcome various natural disasters or greatly reduce the disasters. When the army receives various disaster forecasts, it should quickly notify residents near the station and assist the local people's committee in organizing local residents to take preventive measures as early as possible.

	XII. The army should plan to assist local cooperatives or factories and mines in running primary schools and night schools, and participate in literacy work. Assistance should be given to local training of teachers, and cooperatives should be helped in training accounting personnel. In addition, cooperatives should be helped to establish libraries and clubs, and they should be supplied with some teaching materials, books, picture albums, and musical instruments. Lectures should be established for them on scientific common sense and current affairs policies. Literacy work should also continue to be carried out within the army. In the future, all soldiers demobilized from the army will be guaranteed to have a primary school education and be taught to speak Mandarin Chinese.

	XIII. The army's existing film projection teams, literary and art work groups, and amateur literary and art groups should make plans according to the situation of the station, and set aside a certain amount of time each month or each quarter to conduct mobile screenings and performances for residents near the station. Generally, troops stationed in rural areas or urban suburbs are required that each projector should show films for agricultural production cooperatives 10 times a year, each cultural troupe should perform for agricultural production cooperatives 5 times a year, and the army's amateur cultural and art groups should have a joint celebration with agricultural production cooperatives once a quarter. When the army shows movies or performs plays, it should try to invite local residents to watch. In addition, people should be sent to help local people carry out cultural, entertainment, and sports activities, help rural areas organize amateur theatrical troupes, and train active farmers in cultural and recreational activities.

	XIV. Under the condition that the mission itself isn't effected, the communications soldiers of the troops should actively assist in the construction of rural broadcasting networks and telephone networks. In addition to combining the construction of the army's communications network, assisting local areas in formulating construction plans for rural telephone networks and wired broadcasting, it is required that wherever the army has erected poles or plans to erect poles to build lines, local areas should be allowed to add telephone lines free of charge, provided that it does not hinder military circuits, and the army is responsible for maintenance. Each telephone corps detachment belonging to the army, division, should set aside no less than 10 working days per year for each telephone soldier, provide their own tools, and help agricultural production cooperatives near the station to erect telephone lines, striving to basically build rural telephone networks and broadcasting networks near the station for local postal and telecommunications departments within three years from 1956 to 1958. The repair organizations and technicians of communications corps at all levels should help agricultural production cooperatives near the station repair telephones, telephone exchanges, and radio telegraphs, radios, etc., and help agricultural production cooperatives near the station train maintenance, repair, and management personnel for telephone equipment.

	XV. In addition to completing their own tasks, the army's repair factories and workshops should help local agricultural production cooperatives repair agricultural implements as much as possible, and when conditions permit, they can also help them repair machinery.

	XVI. When the army plans to build power stations to solve various electricity problems, it should consider the electricity use of local agricultural production cooperatives as much as possible and make overall plans in consultation with the local people's committee.

	XVII. When the army needs to occupy land for construction and training, it should accurately calculate, reasonably allocate, strive to save, and avoid waste.

	XVIII. The education of demobilized soldiers should focus on actively participating in the country's socialist construction, especially actively participating in agricultural production cooperatives, so that they can become the backbone of cooperatives after returning to their hometowns. For various technical personnel of demobilized soldiers, consultations should be held with local administrative departments in advance to make unified arrangements, so that every tank driver, car driver, mechanic, telephone operator, and health worker can go to the production post that needs them most.

	XIX. Military officers at all levels should educate their family members who are accompanying the army but not working on "labor is glorious" and encourage them to participate in local agricultural production cooperatives or organize them to engage in various production labors to increase social wealth.

	XX. Establish regular contacts between the army and local agricultural production cooperatives. Troops and organs and schools stationed in rural areas and near urban suburbs should establish contact with an agricultural production cooperative near the station, regularly provide them with various assistance, and regularly send people to visit the cooperative, or invite comrades from the cooperative to give reports to the troops, or jointly organize various festival commemorative activities or hold get-togethers with the cooperative. Personal contacts can be established between advanced model figures in the army and advanced model figures in the cooperative to encourage and help each other. Troops stationed in cities should also refer to this method to establish certain contacts with local factories and mines, or establish certain contacts with agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs.
