    Eliminating the Remnants of Colonialism
    Lu Prijono, Chairman of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association
    Although Indonesia has formally achieved independence, the anti-colonial sentiments of its people have never disappeared; it could even be said that these feelings are growing stronger.
    This is easy to understand. It is because the revolution that the Indonesian people waged from 1945 to the end of 1949 has not achieved complete independence. West Irian is still occupied by the Netherlands and is being used as a war base for it and its allies – the imperialist countries. The amount of foreign investment in Indonesia totals 5 to 5.5 billion guilders, of which 4 billion guilders belongs to Dutch capital. This capital is guaranteed: it receives an annual profit of 6%. As a result of the Round Table Conference between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the Republic of Indonesia was forced to accept debts from the Dutch East Indies government totaling over 2 billion guilders. Indonesia must pay 3% interest annually. A portion of these huge debts was borrowed by the Netherlands from the United States, Canada, and Britain during World War II.
    The aforementioned Dutch and other foreign capital has been invested in various industries and enterprises, greatly reducing the scope of Indonesian national enterprises. Here are a few examples: for instance, the Indonesian inter-island shipping industry, which is the basic economic foundation, is 95% in the hands of foreigners. The petroleum enterprises and metal industries are also entirely in foreign hands.
    In addition to the very heavy financial and economic pressures, there are also political and psychological pressures placed on the Indonesian people. As a result of the Round Table Conference, Indonesia is also bound in the Netherlands-Indonesia Union, with the Dutch Queen as the head of this union. Indonesian social life, especially in major cities such as Jakarta and Surabaya, is almost similar to Shanghai during the Chiang Kai-shek regime. In Indonesia, although there are no open concessions like in Shanghai, nor insulting words like those seen in Huangpu Park in the past, a hotel opened by the Dutch in Surabaya dared to refuse accommodation to an Indonesian minister, and Dutch-operated ships sailing between the islands in Indonesia still make it difficult for Indonesians to ride in first-class cabins. Conversely, a Dutchman I knew wanted to take a Dutch ship to Hong Kong, but he was refused a second-class ticket. This is because second-class (and third-class) cabins are only used to transport people with colored skin, and in order to maintain the noble status of the white-skinned people, white-skinned people must travel in first-class cabins! The general Indonesian people, who have truly recognized the means of the imperialist capitalists, firmly believe that the Netherlands is still carrying out or supporting various subversive movements in Indonesia. Westerling, the man who massacred 40,000 Indonesians and attempted to overthrow the government of the Republic of Indonesia by means of slaughter, is not isolated. Similarly, Dutch imperialists are not isolated, but have allies in world imperialism.
    In order to oppose enslavement, the Indonesian people have actively organized a national united front. This national united front is composed of all classes, namely Muslims, nationalists, and communists.
    In August 1955, the Indonesian National People's Congress was held in Indonesia. This congress established a united front in order to strive for the return of West Irian to the motherland, as an important condition for making our independence complete.
    In January 1956, mass anti-colonialism rallies were successively held in Jakarta, Yogyakarta, and Semarang. Speakers at the mass rally in Jakarta included former Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo (Indonesian Nationalist Party), Arudji Kartawinata (Chairman of the Indonesian Islamic League Party), D.N. Aidit (General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party), and President Sukarno. All speakers emphasized the importance of all classes uniting against colonialism. Approximately 750,000 people participated in this rally.
    The mass rally held in Yogyakarta received the support of 50 political parties and organizations. The mass rally held in Semarang was endorsed by 53 political parties and organizations. The speakers at these rallies were representatives of Muslims, nationalists, and communists.
    Such mass rallies against enslavement will also be held in Bukittinggi, Padang, Solok, Sawah Lunto, Pariaman, and throughout Indonesia.
    As mentioned above, the Indonesian people understand that the Dutch imperialists are not isolated. It is precisely for this reason that the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955 was completely in line with the wishes of the Indonesian people. This wish is: in order to eliminate colonialism from this land, the national forces must be unified on the basis of solidarity, becoming an international force against colonialism. Only in this way can people hope that the struggle to eliminate colonialism, which is still rampant in the "free world," will be victorious, and only through such a victory can people guarantee world peace.

    消灭殖民主义残余
    印度尼西亚中国友好协会主席　鲁·普里约诺
    印度尼西亚虽然已正式独立，但是人民的反殖民主义感情却从未消失过，甚至可以说，这种感情正日益浓厚。
    这是容易理解的。这是因为印度尼西亚人民自1945年至1949年底所进行的革命还没有取得完整的独立。西伊里安仍然还为荷兰所占领，并被作为它和它的同盟者——各帝国主义国家——的战争基地。在印度尼西亚的外国投资额，共达50亿至55亿荷盾，其中40亿荷盾是属于荷兰资本。这些资本得到了保障：它每年获得了6％的利润。作为印度尼西亚和荷兰之间所举行的圆桌会议的后果，印度尼西亚共和国被迫接受了荷印政府的债务共达20亿荷盾以上。印度尼西亚每年必须付出3％的利息。这些巨额的债务，有一部分是荷兰在第二次世界大战期间向美国、加拿大和英国借来的。
    上述荷兰及其它外国资本，是被投进到各种工业和企业中间，从而大大缩小了印度尼西亚民族企业的范围，以下是几个例子：例如作为基本的经济基础的印度尼西亚岛际航运业，其中有95％是在外国人手里。石油企业和金属工业，也全部在外国人手中。
    除了十分沉重的财政和经济方面的压力之外，加在印度尼西亚人民身上的还有政治和心理方面的压力。作为圆桌会议的后果，印度尼西亚还被束缚在荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦里面，而这个联邦的元首是荷兰女皇。印度尼西亚的社会生活，特别是在各大城市如雅加达和泗水等，几乎与蒋介石政权时期的上海相似。在印度尼西亚，虽然没有如上海那样公开的租界，也没有如过去在黄浦公园所看到的那样侮辱人们的字眼，但是在泗水，却有一间荷兰人开设的旅馆居然敢于拒绝印度尼西亚的一位部长住宿，而荷兰人在印度尼西亚所经营的航行于各岛之间的轮船，也仍然还在刁难印度尼西亚人趁搭头等舱位。相反地，有一个我所认识的荷兰人，他想搭荷兰轮船到香港，但他被拒绝购买二等船票。这是因为二等舱位（和三等舱位）只是用来运载有色皮肤的人们，而为了保持白色皮肤民族的高尚地位，白色皮肤的人们必须趁坐头等舱位！一般已经真正认识了帝国主义资本家的手段的印度尼西亚人民，他们坚信荷兰仍然还在进行或支持在印度尼西亚的各种颠覆运动。韦斯特灵，这个曾经屠杀过4万名印度尼西亚人并且曾经企图以屠杀手段来推翻印度尼西亚共和国政府的人，他不是孤立的。同样地，荷兰帝国主义者也不是孤立的，而是有着世界帝国主义方面的同盟者。
    为了反对奴役，印度尼西亚人民已经积极地组织民族统一战线。这个民族统一战线，是由所有阶层，即由伊斯兰教徒、民族主义者和共产主义者所组成。
    1955年8月，在印度尼西亚举行了印度尼西亚全国人民大会。这个大会建立了统一战线，以便争取将西伊里安归还祖国，以作为使我们的独立得到完整的重要条件之一。
    1956年1月间，在雅加达、日惹和三宝垅相继召开了反殖民主义的群众大会。在雅加达的群众大会上发言的有前内阁总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约（印度尼西亚国民党）、阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔（印度尼西亚回教联盟党主席）、艾地（印度尼西亚共产党总书记）和苏加诺总统。所有发言者都强调了各阶层团结起来反对殖民主义的重要性。这次大会约有75万人参加。
    在日惹举行的群众大会，获得了50个政党和团体的支持。在三宝垅召开的群众大会，得到了53个政党和团体的拥护。在这些大会上的发言者，都是伊斯兰教徒、民族主义者和共产主义者的代表。
    这种反对奴役的群众大会，也将在武吉丁宜、巴东、梭洛克、沙哇仑多、巴利亚曼及印度尼西亚全国各地举行。
    上面已经说过，印度尼西亚人民懂得荷兰帝国主义者并不是孤立的。正因为如此，所以1955年4月在万隆召开的亚非会议是完全符合印度尼西亚人民的愿望的。这个愿望就是：为了把殖民主义从这个土地上消灭掉，必须在团结的基础上把民族力量统一起来，成为反殖民主义的国际力量。唯有这样，人们才能希望为了消灭目前还猖獗在“自由世界”中的殖民主义而进行的斗争获得胜利，也唯有通过这种胜利，人们才能保障世界和平。
