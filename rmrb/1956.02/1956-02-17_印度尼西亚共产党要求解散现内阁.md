Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 16th. The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, in a statement issued on the 14th, demanded the immediate dissolution of the Harahap government and called for the unilateral cancellation of the Round Table Conference Agreement by relying on the united strength of all Indonesian people. This statement was published in the Indonesian "People's Daily" on February 15th.

    The statement said that the Harahap government has lost the trust of the majority of the people and has been opposed by them. The people's call for the cabinet to resign, or at least not to take any steps that are fundamental and have far-reaching implications, is growing stronger. However, the Harahap cabinet stubbornly maintains its rule and continues to take measures such as holding negotiations with the Netherlands in Geneva, which have caused unease and indignation among the people.

    The statement said that from the beginning, people expected that the outcome of the negotiations in Geneva and the Netherlands by the delegation headed by Foreign Minister Agung would either be the signing of some agreements harmful to Indonesia or end in complete failure.

    The statement pointed out that only when the Netherlands is under the pressure of the strong and united will of the Indonesian people and international public opinion will it negotiate with Indonesia on the West Irian issue and the Round Table Conference Agreement. Only when the government has the strong support of the majority of the people can it force the Netherlands to negotiate and obtain favorable results from the negotiations.

    The statement condemned the delegation headed by Agung for taking a series of measures to make concessions to the Netherlands in order to negotiate with the Netherlands. The statement said that the Harahap government's decision to abolish the Netherlands-Indonesia Union is of no great significance, because the abolition of the Netherlands-Indonesia Union can be implemented through the protocol signed by former Foreign Minister Sunario and Dutch Foreign Minister Luns. The Harahap government's mere cancellation of the federal relationship with the Netherlands cannot compensate for all its faults and policy failures.

    The statement called on all democratic parties and all social strata to unite and fight for the immediate dissolution of the Harahap government and the unilateral cancellation of the Round Table Conference Agreement.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 15th. According to Antara News Agency, the Indonesian Cabinet held a meeting on the evening of February 13th and decided to abolish the federal relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands. A government communique issued following the cabinet meeting stated that, considering the situation after the failure of the Indonesia-Netherlands conference in Geneva, the government decided: 1. to abolish the federal relationship with the Netherlands; 2. to consider taking further steps regarding other agreements of the Round Table Conference; 3. to report these decisions to the Parliament.

    The "Independent Daily" reported that the Masyumi Party, the Indonesian Nationalist Party, and the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association held a joint meeting on February 13th to discuss the current situation after the failure of the Geneva talks. The Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association had made it clear that if the Harahap cabinet refused to return the mandate, they would not join the Masyumi Party in diplomatic actions with far-reaching consequences.

    Indonesian Nationalist Party leader Mangunsarkoro said that because the government does not have the support of the people, it is in a weak position and therefore should not take measures with long-term consequences, such as negotiating with the Netherlands. When talking about the issue of abolishing the federal relationship between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the Nationalist Party leader said that these steps should be taken not by the current cabinet, but by the next cabinet.

    印度尼西亚共产党要求解散现内阁
    新华社雅加达16日讯　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会书记处在14日发表的声明中，要求立即解散哈拉哈普政府，并且要求依靠全体印度尼西亚人民团结一致的力量来单方面地取消圆桌会议协议。这个声明刊载在2月15日的印度尼西亚“人民日报”上。
    声明说，哈拉哈普政府已经丧失了大多数人民的信任，并且遭到了他们的反对。人民要求内阁辞职或者至少不要采取任何具有基本性质和产生深远影响的步骤的呼声日益强烈。但是，哈拉哈普内阁顽固地保持它的统治地位，并且继续采取像在日内瓦同荷兰举行谈判这样的措施，这些谈判已经在人民中间引起了不安和愤慨。
    声明说，人们从一开始就预料，以外交部长阿贡为首的代表团在日内瓦和荷兰举行的谈判的结果，不是签订某些对印度尼西亚有害的协定，就是以完全的失败而告终。
    声明指出，只有当荷兰受到印度尼西亚人民强烈和一致的意志以及国际舆论的压力，它才会就西伊里安问题和圆桌会议协定同印度尼西亚进行谈判。只有当政府得到大多数人民的有力支持，它才能迫使荷兰进行谈判，才能从谈判中得到有利的结果。
    声明谴责以阿贡为首的代表团为了同荷兰谈判采取了一系列的对荷兰让步的措施。声明说，哈拉哈普政府所作出的取消荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦的决定一点都没有重大的意义，因为通过前任外交部长苏纳约同荷兰外交大臣伦斯签订的议定书就可以实行取消荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦。哈拉哈普政府仅仅取消同荷兰的联邦关系不能弥补它的全部过错和政策的失败。
    声明号召一切民主党派和各社会阶层团结起来，为立即解散哈拉哈普政府和单方面地取消圆桌会议协定而斗争。
    据新华社雅加达15日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚内阁在2月13日晚间举行会议，决定废除印度尼西亚同荷兰的联邦关系。在内阁会议后发表的政府公报说，考虑到在日内瓦举行的印度尼西亚—荷兰会议失败以后的局势，政府决定：一、废除同荷兰的联邦关系；二、考虑在圆桌会议的其他协定方面采取进一步的步骤；三、向国会报告这些决定。
    “独立报”报道说，马斯友美党、印度尼西亚国民党和印度尼西亚回教师联合会2月13日举行了联席会议，讨论日内瓦会谈失败后的目前局势。印度尼西亚国民党和印度尼西亚回教师联合会曾经明白表示，如果哈拉哈普内阁拒绝交还委任状的话，他们将不在具有深远后果的外交行动中同马斯友美党联合。
    印度尼西亚国民党领袖曼贡萨科罗说，由于政府没有得到人民的支持，所以它处在无力的地位，因此，不应该采取像同荷兰进行谈判这种具有长远后果的措施。在谈到废除印度尼西亚同荷兰的联邦关系问题时，这位国民党领袖说，应该采取这些步骤的不是目前的内阁，而是下届内阁的事情。
