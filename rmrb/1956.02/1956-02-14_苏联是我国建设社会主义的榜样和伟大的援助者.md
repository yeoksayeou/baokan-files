    The Soviet Union is a Model for Our Socialist Construction and a Great Helper
    Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
    Today is a great festival of Sino-Soviet friendship. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed six years ago marked a new stage in the development of friendly relations between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Over the past six years, the fraternal friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, based on a new type of international relations, have continued to develop and become increasingly consolidated. History has proven that the powerful alliance between the people of China and the Soviet Union is an important guarantee for peace in the Far East and the world. The mutual assistance and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has played an inestimable and significant role in the common economic upsurge of the two countries, especially in China's socialist construction.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese revolution shifted from the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution to the stage of socialist revolution, that is, it entered a period of transition from capitalism to socialism. We know that carrying out a socialist revolution in a country with a population of 600 million and with a very backward economy and culture is not an easy task and will inevitably encounter many difficulties. However, our country is now in a new historical period. We have Lenin's theory of the transition period as a guide, the rich experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism as a model, and, in particular, the great selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country, coupled with other favorable international conditions and our own hard work. The Chinese people have extremely favorable conditions for building socialism, and the Chinese people have a reliable guarantee for rapidly completing the socialist revolution.
      The Soviet Union's experience in building socialism proves that to solve the economic tasks of socialism, it is necessary not only to develop an industrial system based on heavy industry, but also to transfer the national economy, including agriculture, to the technical basis of large-scale production, and to change the national economy, including multiple economic components, into a single socialist economy. At the same time, without a cultural revolution, the construction of socialism would be impossible. The valuable experience of the Soviet people in building socialism is of particular importance to the Chinese people who are determined to build their motherland into a prosperous and strong socialist country. It is precisely because the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, apply the experience of the Soviet people in building socialism in accordance with the characteristics of Chinese society, that China's socialist construction can advance by leaps and bounds.
    China is currently in a high tide of the great socialist revolution. The general line of the Party during the transition period is to gradually realize socialist industrialization and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in our country, which began in 1953, was formulated in accordance with this general task. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the socialist transformation of our country is developing at an astonishing speed. At present, hundreds of millions of peasants in rural areas across the country have set off a high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement. By the end of January this year, the number of peasant households joining agricultural producers' cooperatives accounted for 78% of the total number of peasant households in the country. The socialist transformation of handicraft industry cooperation and capitalist industry and commerce across the country has also entered a high tide. At present, more than 70% of the capitalist industry and commerce in cities across the country have fully realized joint state-private ownership. At present, the scale and speed of China's socialist transformation have greatly exceeded the tasks stipulated in the first five-year plan, providing extremely favorable conditions for the accelerated development of China's socialist industrialization and the new upsurge of the entire national economy. The development of this new situation has also promoted China's socialist cultural construction. At present, the movement to study Marxism-Leninism is being widely launched. Intellectuals across the country are responding to the Party's call and striving to enable the most urgently needed scientific departments in our country to approach the advanced world level within 12 years, that is, by the end of the third five-year plan period. China's socialist transformation is developing so rapidly, so Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed throughout the country." The practice of the Chinese people in building socialism proves that with the valuable experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the hardworking and brave Chinese people can completely and quickly complete the socialist revolution and build the motherland into a prosperous and strong socialist industrial country with a high degree of culture.
      In the socialist construction of our country, the Soviet government and the Soviet people have given our country great, long-term, comprehensive and selfless assistance. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements between China and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union assists our country's recovery and construction through various means such as loans, trade, scientific and technological cooperation, sending experts, and supplying equipment. According to the agreements concluded in 1953 and 1954, the 156 industrial enterprises that the Soviet Union helped China design and build are the center of industrial construction in China's first five-year plan. The construction of these industrial enterprises will change the long-term backwardness of China's economy and lay a solid foundation for China's socialist industrialization. In order to complete this great construction task, the Soviet Union has carried out a series of thorough assistance to us, from exploring geology, selecting factory sites, collecting basic design data, carrying out design, supplying equipment, guiding construction and installation and starting operation, and supplying technical data for new varieties, to guiding the manufacture of new products. The designs provided by the Soviet Union are the latest technological achievements of the Soviet Union, and the equipment given to us by the Soviet Union is the top-notch and most advanced equipment. According to preliminary calculations by the State Statistical Bureau, by the end of 1955, 29 of these 156 industrial enterprises had been fully or partially put into production. In addition, in various departments of China's economic and cultural construction, such as agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, railways, transportation, post and telecommunications, construction, geology, culture, education, science, and health, we have all received various aspects of assistance from the Soviet Union.
    One of the important ways in which the Soviet Union assists our country is to provide regular scientific and technological assistance to our country through scientific and technological cooperation. The Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement signed in 1954 has made the cooperation between the two countries in this regard develop more organized and planned, and more effectively promoted the common economic upsurge of the two countries. According to this agreement, our country has obtained more and more assistance from the Soviet Union in socialist construction. These technical materials are the most advanced and exquisite, and are necessary for our country's construction, and are huge in quantity. In addition to providing technical materials to our country, the Soviet Union also sent a large number of experts with superb scientific knowledge and rich practical work experience to help us and introduce us to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism in various aspects. The Soviet experts' high degree of internationalist spirit and selfless labor attitude are universally respected by the Chinese people. At the same time, the Soviet Union also receives a large number of our country's professional inspection experts and accepts our country's students and interns to help them learn from the Soviet Union's production and construction experience. We can fully believe that through scientific and technological cooperation, under the guidance of Soviet experts, in a not-too-long period of time, our country can get rid of its backward state in science and technology and enter the track of the world's advanced science and technology.
    What should be mentioned in particular is the sincere and selfless help that the Soviet Union has given to our country in the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Union has planned to build an experimental atomic reactor with a heat output of 6,500 kilowatts for our country, and help our country train scientists and technical cadres in the peaceful use of atomic energy. In order to further help our country develop the peaceful use of atomic energy, at the end of last year, the Soviet Union specially sent a delegation composed of outstanding scientists to our country to introduce the achievements of the Geneva International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy to our country's scientists. With the help of the Soviet Union, our country can master the world's most advanced atomic energy science and technology in a short period of time, which undoubtedly has a very important significance for our country's socialist construction.
    In addition, according to the agreements of 1950 and 1954, the Soviet Union also granted our country long-term preferential loans totaling 300 million US dollars and 520 million rubles. Over the past six years, the trade between China and the Soviet Union has also been developing continuously. In 1955, the total volume of import and export trade between China and the Soviet Union increased by 4.3 times compared with 1950. Through this trade, our country can obtain a large number of complete sets of equipment and materials that are cheap and of good quality. This preferential loan and trade relations based on equality and mutual benefit have accelerated the process of our country's recovery and construction.
    The Soviet Union's great and selfless assistance to our country is a profound reflection of a new type of international relations based on "mutual assistance and sincere desire to seek common economic upsurge." Today, it has blossomed and borne fruit in our country's socialist construction. The mutual assistance and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union is not only beneficial to our country's construction cause, and beneficial to the prosperity and progress of China and the Soviet Union, but also beneficial to world peace.
    Today, when celebrating the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we are also celebrating the opening day of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At this congress, the outstanding representatives of the Soviet people will sum up the new experience of Soviet construction and formulate a magnificent construction plan to make the Soviet Union move further along the road to communism. In addition to expressing gratitude to our great helper, the Chinese people will also draw infinite strength from the new construction experience and construction plan of the Soviet Union, and redouble our efforts to make our country's socialist construction cause a victory as soon as possible.

    苏联是我国建设社会主义的榜样和伟大的援助者
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理　李先念
    今天是中苏友好的伟大节日。六年前签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约标志着中苏两国人民友好关系发展的新阶段。六年以来，建立在新型国际关系基础上的中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊和互助合作不断发展，日益巩固。历史证明：中苏两国人民的强大同盟是远东和世界和平的重要保证；中苏两国之间的互助合作，对两国经济的共同高涨，特别是对我国的社会主义建设事业，起了无法估量的巨大作用。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，中国革命就由资产阶级民主革命阶段转变到社会主义革命阶段，即进入由资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。我们知道，要在一个拥有6亿人口、经济和文化都十分落后的国家中进行社会主义革命，并不是一件轻而易举的事情，而且必然要遇到很多困难。然而，目前我国毕竟是处在一个新的历史时期，我们有列宁的过渡时期的学说为指针，有苏联建设社会主义的丰富经验作榜样，而且，特别是有苏联对我国的伟大无私的援助，再加上其他有利的国际条件以及我们自己的发奋努力，我国人民建设社会主义就有了极其优越的条件，我国人民迅速地完成社会主义革命就有了可靠的保证。
      苏联建设社会主义的经验证明：要解决社会主义的经济任务，就不仅要发展以重工业为基础的工业体系，而且要把包括农业在内的国民经济转到大生产的技术基础上来，把包括多种经济成分的国民经济改变成为单一的社会主义经济；同时，如果没有文化革命，建设社会主义也就不可能实现。苏联人民建设社会主义的宝贵经验，对于决心要把自己的祖国建成繁荣富强的社会主义国家的中国人民具有特别重要的意义。正因为中国人民在共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，根据中国社会的特点，运用苏联人民建设社会主义的经验，才能使中国的社会主义建设一日千里地向前迈进。
    中国目前正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中。党在过渡时期的总路线是：逐步实现社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。1953年开始实行的我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划就是根据这个总任务制定的。由于党和毛泽东同志的正确领导，我国的社会主义改造事业正以惊人的速度发展着。目前，全国农村中的几亿农民已经掀起农业合作化运动的高潮。到今年1月底止，加入农业生产合作社的农户已占全国总农户数的78％。全国手工业合作化和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造也已经进入了高潮。目前全国已有70％以上城市的资本主义工商业全部实现了公私合营。目前我国社会主义改造事业的规模和速度已大大超过第一个五年计划所规定的任务，为我国社会主义工业化的加速发展和整个国民经济的新高涨提供了十分有利的条件。这种新的形势的发展，同时推动了我国的社会主义文化建设。目前马克思列宁主义的学习运动正在广泛地展开。全国知识分子正响应党的号召，争取在12年内，即在第三个五年计划期末，使我国最急需的科学部门能够接近世界先进水平。我国社会主义改造事业发展得如此迅速，因此毛泽东同志说：“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。”中国人民建设社会主义的实践证明：有了苏联建设社会主义的宝贵经验，在共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，勤劳勇敢的中国人民是完全可以迅速地完成社会主义革命，把祖国建成一个繁荣富强的、具有高度文化的社会主义工业国家。
      在我国社会主义建设事业中，苏联政府和苏联人民给予我国以伟大的、长期的、全面的、无私的援助。根据中苏友好同盟互助条约以及中苏两国之间的其他协定，苏联通过贷款、贸易、科学技术合作、派遣专家、供应设备等各种方式来援助我国的恢复和建设事业。根据1953年和1954年缔结的协定，苏联帮助我国设计和建设的156项工业企业，是我国第一个五年计划中工业建设的中心。这些工业企业的建设将改变我国经济长期落后的面貌，为我国社会主义工业化打下坚固的基础。为了完成这项伟大的建设任务，从勘探地质，选择厂址，搜集设计基础资料，进行设计，供应装备，指导建筑安装和开工运转，供应新品种的技术资料，直到指导新产品的制造等等，苏联对我们进行了一系列的彻底的援助。苏联提供的设计都是苏联最新的技术成就，苏联给予我们的设备都是头等的最先进的设备。根据国家统计局的初步计算：到1955年年底为止，这156项工业企业中已有29项全部或部分投入生产。此外，在我国经济文化建设各部门中，例如农业、水利、林业、铁路、交通、邮电、建筑、地质、文化、教育、科学、卫生等部门中，我们都得到了苏联的多方面的援助。
    苏联对我国援助的重要方式之一是，通过科学技术合作对我国进行经常的科学技术的援助。1954年签订的中苏科学技术合作协定，使两国在这方面的合作更加有组织有计划地向前发展，更有效地促进两国经济的共同高涨。根据这项协定，我国在社会主义建设中获得苏联越来越多的援助。这些技术资料都是最先进的和精湛的，都是我国建设所必需的，而且是数量巨大的。苏联除了向我国提供技术资料以外，还派遣大批具有精湛的科学知识和丰富的实际工作经验的专家帮助我们，向我们介绍苏联建设社会主义的各方面的先进经验。苏联专家的高度的国际主义精神和忘我的劳动态度，受到我国人民的普遍尊敬。同时，苏联还大量接待我国各种专业考察专家，并接受我国的留学生和实习生，帮助他们学习苏联生产建设经验。我们完全可以相信：通过科学技术合作，在苏联专家的指导下，在不太长的时间内，我国就可以在科学技术方面摆脱落后的状态，进入世界先进的科学技术的轨道。
    这里特别要提到的是，苏联在和平利用原子能方面给予我国的真诚无私的帮助。苏联已经计划为我国建立一个发热量为6，500瓩的实验性原子反应堆，并且帮助我国训练和平利用原子能方面的科学家和技术干部。为了进一步帮助我国发展和平利用原子能事业，去年年底苏联又特别派遣一个由杰出的科学家组成的代表团前来我国，向我国科学家介绍日内瓦和平利用原子能国际会议的成果。我国在苏联的帮助下，能在短期内掌握世界最先进的原子能科学技术，无疑地，对我国社会主义建设具有十分重要的意义。
    此外，根据1950年和1954年的协定，苏联还给予我国总数为3亿美元和52，000万卢布的长期优惠贷款。六年来，中苏两国的贸易也在不断发展，1955年中苏两国之间的进出口贸易总额已较1950年增加了四点三倍。通过这种贸易我国可以得到大批的价廉物美的整套设备和器材。这种优惠的贷款和建立在平等互利的基础上的贸易关系，加速了我国恢复和建设的过程。
    苏联对我国的伟大无私的援助是建立在“互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望”基础上的新型国际关系的深刻体现。今天，它已经在我国的社会主义建设中开花结实。中苏两国人民的互助合作不仅有利于我国的建设事业，有利于中苏两国的繁荣和进步，而且有利于世界和平。
    我们今天庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订六周年的时候，正逢到苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的开幕日。在这次代表大会上，苏维埃人民的优秀代表将总结出苏联建设的新的经验，制定使苏联向共产主义的道路更加前进一步的宏伟的建设计划。中国人民除了对我们的伟大的援助者表示感谢以外，我们还将要从苏联新的建设经验和建设计划中吸取无穷的力量，加倍努力，使我国社会主义建设事业早日胜利完成。
