    Liu Xuefo's Experience in High Cotton Yields
    Wu Yingtang
    Liu Xuefo, a platoon leader of a production and construction unit of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Manas River Basin, achieved a maximum average yield of 1,349 jin per mu of cotton cultivated in 1953, setting a national record. In 1955, Liu Xuefo led a platoon to cultivate more than 491 mu of cotton land, with an average yield of 550 jin per mu; among them, more than 14 mu yielded an average of 1,195 jin per mu; and within the 14 mu, 1.05 mu of land yielded an average of 1,392 jin per mu, once again setting the national record for cotton yield.

    The reason why Liu Xuefo's production unit was able to achieve excellent results in high cotton yields is mainly because he and his comrades conscientiously adopted the advanced Soviet cotton planting technology.

    From several years of production, Liu Xuefo has realized that meticulous land preparation is very important for high cotton yields. To obtain high yields, one must have neat and strong seedlings; and the prerequisite for the good growth of seedlings lies in whether the land is carefully prepared. Therefore, the cotton fields cultivated under Liu Xuefo's leadership are all plowed with tractors to a depth of 20 to 23 centimeters in the autumn every year. After thawing in the spring, in order to loosen the soil and conserve moisture, when people and horses can go to the ground, they are harrowed twice vertically and horizontally with a "zigzag" harrow to loosen the topsoil. Two or three days before sowing, single-body plows and double-furrow plows pulled by horses are used for shallow plowing and fertilization at a depth of 12 to 14 centimeters (if the soil is loose and deep plowing and fertilization have been carried out in the autumn, just harrowing is enough); immediately afterwards, a "zigzag" harrow is used for two horizontal harrowings to completely break up the soil.

    The sowing period for cotton in Liu Xuefo's unit is determined every year according to the frost period and ground temperature. Usually, 10 days before the end of the last frost, when the local temperature rises to above 12 degrees Celsius at a depth of 5 to 6 centimeters where the seeds are covered with soil, sowing begins. The sowing depth is generally 5 to 6 centimeters, the sowing amount is 15 jin per mu, the seeds are manually selected, and then they are sun-dried for 5 days in the sunlight half a month before sowing, and then treated with seed dressing. In order to ensure that the cotton seedlings can evenly receive sunlight after emergence, Liu Xuefo and his comrades adopt north-south row sowing according to the terrain conditions. After sowing, local compaction is carried out to ensure that the seeds are closely combined with the soil, reduce the phenomenon of seeds hanging in the air, and ensure good seedling emergence.

    Reasonable close planting and early seedling setting are also important factors for Liu Xuefo's high cotton yields in the past three years. Every year, when most of the cotton seedlings have emerged and the first true leaf appears, they begin the seedling setting work, which ends when the second true leaf appears; if the cotton seedlings are crowded, it begins when the cotyledons grow out. They use a two-meter-long wooden stick with a wooden nail nailed every 13 centimeters to reserve seedlings according to the nails. In this way, not only is it guaranteed that there are 7,500 plants per mu in all cotton fields, but also the plants obtain uniform nutritional area and space for sunlight in the soil, so that the cotton can develop well.

    Cotton not only needs a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer, but also needs more phosphate fertilizer and potash fertilizer. In addition to planting green manure crops in the first year, turning them into the soil layer during autumn plowing, and applying more than 6,000 jin of mixed farm manure per mu in spring plowing combined with pre-sowing shallow plowing, the cotton fields in Liu Xuefo's unit also topdressed 3 to 4 times during the growing period. In 1955, their cotton was topdressed three times in total. The first time was when the cotton appeared with 3 true leaves, and topdressing was applied 10 centimeters away from the roots of the cotton seedlings, at a depth of 10 centimeters. This topdressing mainly accelerates seedling growth. The second time was when one or two flower buds generally appeared on the cotton plants, immediately after the pants-removing work, topdressing was applied with a topdressing machine 12 centimeters away from the roots of the cotton seedlings, at a depth of 12 to 13 centimeters. This topdressing is mainly a fertilizer mixed with superphosphate and decomposed farm manure. Its function is to accelerate the growth of plants, and also meet the seedlings' certain requirements for phosphate fertilizer, so as to promote the rapid increase of flower buds. The third time was when the cotton was just blooming. At this time, the cotton plants need the most phosphate fertilizer, so superphosphate should be topdressed in order to make the cotton bloom earlier. After the cotton closes its rows and machines and horses cannot go to the ground, in order to meet the needs of cotton plant development and make the cotton bolls grow and mature quickly, they use 0.5% superphosphate solution and use a sprayer for two foliar fertilizer applications (the interval between the two times is half a month). According to Liu Xuefo's experience, the cotton that has been foliar topdressed with phosphate fertilizer has particularly dark green leaves, and the weight of cotton bolls has also increased from 0.2 grams to 0.3 grams.

    Liu Xuefo has experienced that "diligent cultivation and early cultivation" not only have a significant effect on the normal growth of cotton, but also have a great effect on reducing flower and bud drop. Their cotton fields are cultivated every year after the cotton seedlings emerge and the row direction can be distinguished, and then cultivated about every 10 days according to the actual situation until the cotton closes its rows and horses and machines cannot go to the ground. After each irrigation, as long as people and horses can go to the ground, cultivation is carried out between the cotton rows and cotton plants. The earlier the first cultivation time of cotton, the better, especially when the climate changes frequently, this should be done even more. In 1954, the climate in the Manas River Basin was changeable. At that time, Soviet experts proposed the suggestion of "putting fur coats on cotton plants" (i.e., early cultivation to increase ground temperature). Liu Xuefo's production unit cultivated the land when the cotton seedlings had just emerged. As a result, not only was the good growth of seedlings guaranteed, but also the occurrence of root rot disease due to insufficient ground temperature was effectively prevented.

    The cultivation depth is determined according to the degree of root system rooting, generally from shallow to deep, and then from deep to shallow, with the shallowest being 8 centimeters and the deepest being 16 centimeters. At the same time, the cultivation work closely follows irrigation and rain.

    Cotton irrigation is carried out according to the water demand of cotton plants according to the method of "frequent and light irrigation." The cotton cultivated by Liu Xuefo's production unit usually needs to be watered 6 to 7 times during the entire growth period. Their cotton fields are furrow irrigated. The first irrigation time is after the first topdressing. The amount of water this time is not large, but it can promote the rapid dissolution of topdressing and avoid drought damage to seedlings. The second time is on the third day after removing the pants, when three flower buds generally appear on the cotton plants. The third time is in the early flowering stage of cotton, which is when the cotton plants need the most water, and the water demand is large. The fourth time is during the period of mass flowering of cotton, and the water demand is also very large. The ditch depth is opened to 22 centimeters, and the amount of water is about 18 to 20 centimeters. Watering this time can concentrate the flowering period. The fifth time is during the period of rapid cotton boll growth. This time, trickle irrigation should be used so that the water can deeply penetrate the soil layer after repeated irrigation and hardening of the soil, ensuring the water needed for cotton boll maturation. The sixth time is around August 10.

    Liu Xuefo said: "Fine pruning to control cotton overgrowth is an effective measure to increase yield and improve cotton fiber quality." Every year, when one or two flower buds appear on the cotton plants, all the leaves and branches under the first fruiting branch are removed in order to concentrate nutrients, accelerate the growth of cotton plants and the formation of flower buds. Afterwards, the growing branches between the fruiting branches should be wiped off as they grow.

    Topping and removing side shoots are one of the contents of pruning to control cotton overgrowth. The topping and side shoot removal work in Liu Xuefo's unit in 1955 was carried out in two times (large-scale pruning work can be carried out at one time to save labor). Topping was around July 23, and side shoot removal (group shoots) started around July 26 (after topping). The method of leaving bolls for side shoot removal is mainly determined according to the different fruiting branch parts. Generally, 4 bolls are left on the lower fruiting branches, 3 on the middle, and only one or two on the upper ones. This ensures that most of the remaining flower bolls mature before the frost, which not only reduces the flowers after the frost, but also relatively increases the yield.

    From several years of production practice, Liu Xuefo has realized that in order for cotton to obtain high yields, overcoming natural disasters and various insect pests is something that must not be taken lightly. In 1954, their cotton did not reach the planned yield because it was affected by climate and insect pests, especially because the prevention and control of cotton bollworm was not timely, resulting in a cotton damage rate of more than 85%.

    In order to implement the policy of prevention first, in addition to autumn plowing all the cotton fields for the following year in the autumn of 1954, when the insects began to pupate in the spring of 1955, all the weeds within 10 meters around all cotton fields were completely removed; after cotton sowing, they also began to put syrup trays around the cotton fields to catch insects. In every field operation process, they also carried out the work of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. For example, the branches and leaves removed during seedling setting, pants removal, and pruning and topping operations must be taken out of the field and buried in the soil at a depth of about 20 centimeters, which ensures the cleanliness of the field and prevents the spread of insect pests.

    In the struggle against insect pests, Liu Xuefo's production unit also specially organized an insect situation investigation team, and immediately eliminated pests when they were found. Their experience in overcoming insect pests is: treat early; and constantly carry out prevention work in conjunction with field operations.

    刘学佛的棉花丰产经验
    吴映堂
    中国人民解放军新疆军区驻玛纳斯河流域生产建设部队某部排长刘学佛1953年栽培的棉花，平均每亩最高产量达到1，349斤，创造了全国最高纪录。1955年，刘学佛领导一个排栽培了491亩多地的棉花，每亩平均产量达到550斤；其中14亩多，平均每亩产1，195斤；14亩中又有1.05亩地，平均每亩产1，392斤，又一次创造了全国棉花产量的最高纪录。
    刘学佛的生产单位所以能够取得棉花丰产的优良成绩，主要是因为他和他的同志们认真地采用了苏联的先进植棉技术。
    刘学佛从几年来的生产中体会到：精细的整地工作对于棉花丰产有很大关系。要想获高额产量，必须有整齐健壮的幼苗；而幼苗生长的好坏，先决条件又在于土地整理的是否细致。因此，在刘学佛的领导下耕作的棉田，每年全部用拖拉机进行20至23公分深的秋耕。春天解冻以后，为了松土保墒，在人马能下地的时候，再用“之”字耙纵横耙两遍，耙松表土。在播种前两、三天，又用马拉单体犁和双铧犁，进行12至14公分深的浅耕翻肥（如果土壤疏松，并在秋耕时进行过深耕翻肥，光耙地就可以了）；紧接着，再用“之”字耙横耙两遍，使土壤完全碎散。
    刘学佛所在单位的棉花播种期，每年都是根据霜期和地温决定的，通常是晚霜结束的10天以前，当地温在种子复土深度5至6公分地方上升到摄氏12度以上的时候，就开始播种。播种深度一般是5至6公分，播种量是每亩15市斤，种子经过人工粒选后，并在播种前半个月在日光下晒5天，然后用赛力散拌种。为了使棉花出苗后能均匀地接受日光的照晒，刘学佛和他的同志们根据地形条件采用南北行向播种，播种后进行局部镇压，使种子跟土壤紧密结合，减少种子悬空现象，保证幼苗出土良好。
    合理密植，尽早定苗，也是刘学佛三年来栽培棉花获得丰产的一个重要因素。在每年棉苗大部出土后出现一片真叶的时候，他们开始进行定苗工作，到出现两片真叶的时候结束；如果棉苗拥挤，在子叶长出的时候就开始。他们用两公尺长的木棍，每隔13公分处钉一根木钉，照钉留苗。这样，不但保证了全部棉田每亩有7，500株，同时也使植株在土壤中获得均匀的营养面积和空间的日照，使棉花能够得到良好的发育。
    棉花不仅需要大量的氮肥，而且需要较多的磷肥和钾肥。刘学佛所在单位的棉田，除在头一年播种绿肥作物，在秋耕时翻入土层，并在春耕时结合播前浅耕，每亩施混合厩肥6，000多斤以外，还在生长期间追肥3次到4次。1955年他们的棉花一共追了3次肥，第一次是在棉花出现3片真叶的时候，在距棉苗根旁10公分处追肥，追肥的深度是10公分。这次追肥主要是加速幼苗成长。第二次是棉株普遍出现一至二个花蕾时，紧跟着脱裤腿工作以后，在距离棉苗根旁12公分处，用追肥机追肥，追肥的深度是12至13公分。这次追肥是以过磷酸钙为主和腐熟厩肥混合的肥料，它的作用，除加速植株生长外，同时也满足幼苗对磷肥的一定要求，以促使花蕾迅速增多。第三次是棉花刚开花的时候，这时棉株需要磷肥最多，因此，要追施过磷酸钙，以便使棉花提早开花。在棉花封行后，机械和马匹不能下地时，为了满足棉株发育的需要，使棉铃很快长大成熟，他们用0.5％的过磷酸钙液，用喷雾器作两次根外施肥（两次的间隔是半个月）。根据刘学佛的经验，凡是根外追过磷肥的棉花，叶色特别深绿，棉铃也由0.2公分重提高到0.3公分重。
    刘学佛体验到“勤中耕、早中耕”不仅对于棉花的正常生长有重大作用，而且对于减少落花落蕾也有很大的作用。他们的棉花每年都是在棉苗出土后、能辨清行向的时候就开始中耕，以后根据实际情况每隔10天左右就进行一次中耕，直到棉花封行、马匹、机械不能下地时为止。每次灌水后，只要人马能下地，便在棉行和棉株之间进行中耕。棉花第一次的中耕时间越早越好，特别是在气候经常发生变化的情况下，更应当这样做。1954年玛纳斯河流域的气候变化多端，当时苏联专家提出了“为棉株穿皮袄”（即早耕提高地温）的建议，刘学佛的生产单位在棉苗刚出土的时候就进行了中耕，结果不但保证了幼苗生长良好，而且也有效地防止了因地温不足而产生根腐病的现象。
    中耕深度是根据根系扎的程度来决定的，一般是先由浅到深，然后再由深到浅，最浅8公分，最深16公分。同时，中耕工作紧跟着灌溉和天雨后进行。
    棉花的灌溉是根据棉株的需水情况按照“勤灌轻灌”的方法进行的。刘学佛生产单位栽培的棉花，在整个生长期间，通常要浇水6至7次。他们的棉田是开沟灌溉的。第一次灌溉的时间，是第一次追肥结束后进行的。这次水量不大，但它能促进追肥的迅速溶解和免除幼苗旱害。第二次是在脱完裤腿后的第三天，棉株普遍出现三个花蕾的时期，第三次是棉花开花初期，这是棉株需水最多的时候，需水量大。第四次是棉花大量开花的时期，需水量也很大，沟深开到22公分，水量约为18至20公分，浇过这次水，能使花期集中。第五次是棉铃迅速成长的时期，这次应采用细流灌溉，使水分在土壤经过多次灌溉后发生板结的情况下能深深地渗透土层，保证棉铃成熟所需的水分。第六次是在8月10日前后。
    刘学佛说：“精细整枝，控制棉花徒长，是提高产量、提高棉花纤维品质的一项有效措施。”每年在棉株上出现一至二个花蕾的时候就开始，把第一果枝下的叶枝全部打去，以便集中养分，加速棉株的生长和花蕾的形成。以后果枝间的生长枝应随长随抹。
    打顶尖和摘旁心，是控制棉花徒长的整枝工作的内容之一。刘学佛所在单位1955年的打顶尖和摘旁心的工作，是分两次进行的（大面积的整枝工作，为了节省劳力，可一次进行）。打顶尖在7月23日左右，打旁心在7月26日（打完顶尖）前后开始，打旁心（群尖）留铃的方法，主要是根据不同果枝部位决定的，一般下部果枝留4个铃，中部留3个，上部则只留一至二个就行了。这样就保证了留下的大部花铃在霜前成熟，不但减少了霜后花，也相对地提高了产量。
    刘学佛从几年来的生产实践中体会到：要想棉花获得丰产，战胜自然灾害和战胜各种虫害，是一件千万不能马虎的事。1954年，他们的棉花没有达到计划产量，就是受了气候和虫害的影响，特别是因为防治棉铃虫不及时，致使棉花受害率达到85％以上。
    为了贯彻执行以预防为主的方针，他们除在1954年秋天就把下年的棉田全部进行秋耕外，当1955年春天虫子开始蛹化的时候，又把所有棉田周围10公尺以内的杂草彻底铲除；棉花播种以后，他们又开始在棉田周围放上糖浆盘捉虫。在每一项田间作业过程中，他们也进行防治病虫害的工作，例如在定苗、脱裤腿、整枝打尖作业中，检除的枝叶，都要拿到田外，埋在深度20公分左右的土里，这样就保证了田园清洁，防止了虫害的传播。
    在和虫害作斗争中，刘学佛的生产单位还专门组织了虫情调查组，发现害虫立即扑灭。他们战胜虫害的经验是：要早治；要结合田间作业不断地进行预防工作。
