Two Attitudes

The TASS news agency recently published the correspondence between the heads of state of the Soviet Union and the United States: Eisenhower's reply and Bulganin's second letter to the President of the United States.

The publication of these letters makes clear two different attitudes towards international relations. One is to sincerely advocate strengthening international cooperation, easing international tensions, and constantly seeking to realize these propositions with practical actions; this is the attitude of the Soviet Union. The other is to fear international cooperation and the easing of international tensions, and to try to replace practical actions with empty words in order to evade its undeniable responsibility for strengthening cooperation and mutual trust and easing tensions; this is the attitude of the United States.

Today, it is entirely possible to promote friendship between the Soviet and American people, strengthen economic and cultural ties between the two countries, and commit both sides to respecting national sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs through a treaty. Concluding such a treaty would be endorsed by peace-loving people all over the world, because no one would deny or underestimate the great significance of improving Soviet-American relations for easing international tensions and for resolving many international issues, such as European security, the German question, and disarmament. Concluding such a treaty also conforms to the interests and desires of the American people. Since the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the American people have expressed a particularly strong desire to get along with the Soviet Union, expand cultural exchanges, and develop trade relations. Therefore, world opinion believes that the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a Soviet-American treaty of friendship and cooperation is a realistic way to further improve relations between major powers and strengthen mutual trust and cooperation under the current conditions, and is another major effort by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions.

The practical significance and enormous persuasive power of the Soviet proposal are difficult to refute and deny. Precisely for this reason, the US government could not but admit in its reply that "the current international situation requires all countries, especially major powers, to find ways to ease international tensions and strengthen international trust and cooperation"; it could not but admit that the Soviet and American people have a "historic friendship," "on which a better political relationship can be built." Regrettably, the US government put forward the correct premise, but then overturned it with untenable arguments.

The main reason why the US government refuses to conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union is that the content of the treaty draft "is already included in... the clear provisions of the United Nations Treaty," and therefore it is unnecessary.

The main purpose of the Soviet-American treaty draft is in line with the UN Charter, and it cannot be inferred that this treaty is unnecessary. The Soviet government correctly pointed out in its reply that "the existence of the UN Charter does not preclude the possibility of member states of this organization concluding bilateral agreements based on the principles of the Charter." In fact, if the Soviet Union and the United States conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation that conforms to the principles of the Charter, then the principles of the Charter may be fully effective. The US government's argument is untenable.

The oddity of this argument also lies in the fact that the United States has concluded bilateral or multilateral aggressive treaties that violate the Charter with dozens of countries after the war, but it insists that these treaties are in line with the UN Charter and are a concrete manifestation of the UN Charter. At the tenth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations in June 1955, Dulles described many aggressive treaties, such as the North Atlantic Treaty, the Manila Treaty, and the Paris Accords, as "each embodying the basic principles of the United Nations Charter," "they put the Charter's... ideals into practice, and they operate under the principles of the Charter." At the meeting of the Manila Treaty Council on March 8, 1955, Dulles said again: "Within the scope of the United Nations Charter, the United States has participated in various common security treaties, including Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaya, Pakistan, Australia, and New Zealand, etc...."

In this way, the US government is caught in the web of contradictions it has woven itself. If aggressive treaties that violate the Charter can be insisted on as being in line with the UN Charter and concluded in large quantities, while the Soviet-American treaty that truly conforms to the Charter is rejected precisely because it conforms to the Charter, then people can only draw one conclusion: the United States is using the UN Charter as a convenient tool to promote its aggressive military bloc policy, to obstruct the strengthening of international mutual trust and cooperation, and to maintain international tensions.

It is under such considerations that Dulles promotes his "brink of war" policy. This American attitude toward international relations cannot but arouse the resolute opposition of peace-loving forces all over the world.

The US government also seeks other "reasons" to justify its rejection of Soviet peace proposals. It is said that the conclusion of a Soviet-American treaty could "create the illusion that the results that can only be obtained through a change of spirit can be obtained by waving a pen, which is actually detrimental to the cause of peace." Peace-loving people from all countries cannot agree with such an opinion. Concluding a Soviet-American treaty is a practical action, which can become a lever for enhancing the friendship between the American and Soviet people, and impose moral constraints on those "cold war" experts and warmongers. The Geneva Four-Power Summit is a clear example. The belief in strengthening international cooperation and the good and harmonious atmosphere expressed at this meeting gave a strong impetus to the development of the international situation. In this sense, the Soviet Union's reiterated proposal to conclude a treaty between the North Atlantic Group and the Warsaw Treaty countries is still valid and has a very realistic basis. The US government's "skepticism" about the Soviet-American treaty precisely shows that they fully see the significant role of this treaty, but only because they are afraid of further easing of the international situation do they create various excuses.

Bulganin's two letters powerfully illustrate that the Soviet Union sincerely hopes to coexist peacefully with the United States, and hopes to ease international tensions through the improvement of US-Soviet relations. The proposals in the letter are completely practical and feasible. The US government's reaction reveals the true face of the US ruling clique. People cannot but agree with the commentary in the Indian "New Century News", which said: The US government's rejection clearly shows that the US ruling clique "is opposed to easing world tensions, and they hope to carry out their war preparations."

### 两种态度

    两种态度
    塔斯社最近公布了苏美两国首脑的来往信件：艾森豪威尔的复信和布尔加宁给美国总统的第二封信。
    这些信件的发表使人们看清了对待国际关系的两种不同的态度。一种是真诚主张加强国际合作，和缓国际紧张局势，并且不断地以实际行动来谋求实现这些主张，这就是苏联的态度；另一种是害怕国际合作和国际局势的缓和，竭力用空言代替实际行动，来闪避自己对加强合作互信、和缓紧张局势所负的无可推诿的责任，这就是美国的态度。
    在今天，用通过条约的形式，来促进苏美人民的友谊，加强两国在经济文化方面的联系，并使双方承担互相尊重国家主权和互不干涉内政的义务，已经完全具备了条件。缔结这样一个条约，将获得全世界爱好和平人士的赞同，因为没有一个人会否认或低估改善苏美关系对于和缓国际局势、对于解决许多国际问题，例如欧洲安全、德国问题和裁军问题等的重大意义。缔结这样一个条约，也符合于美国人民的利益和愿望。自日内瓦四国首脑会议以后，美国人民表现了特别强烈的要求，希望和苏联友好相处，扩大文化交流和贸易关系。因此，各国舆论认为，苏联关于缔结苏美友好合作条约的建议，是在目前条件下进一步改善大国关系和加强互信合作的现实的途径，是苏联为和缓国际局势的又一次重大努力。
    苏联建议的现实意义和巨大的说服力量，是很难加以反驳和否定的。正因为这样，所以美国政府在复信中不能不承认“目前的国际局势需要各国、特别是大国来设法缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际信任和合作”；不能不承认苏美两国人民具有“历史性友谊”，“在这个基础上，可以建立起更好的政治关系”。遗憾的是，美国政府提出了正确的前提，但是又以不能成立的论据来推翻了它。
    美国政府拒绝和苏联缔结友好合作条约的主要理由，是这个条约草案的内容，“每一条都已经包括在……联合国条约的明确的条款中”，因而它就成为不必要的了。
    苏美条约草案的主旨符合于联合国宪章，决不能引伸出不需要这个条约的结论。苏联政府在复信中正确地指出：“联合国宪章的存在决不排斥这个组织的成员国之间缔结以宪章的原则为基础的双边协定的可能性。”事实上，如果苏美两国缔结一个符合于宪章原则的友好合作条约，那么，宪章的原则就有可能发生充分的效力。美国政府的论据是不能成立的。
    这一论据的奇特还在于这样的事实：美国在战后和几十个国家缔结了双边的或多边的违反宪章的侵略条约，它却硬说这些条约是符合联合国宪章的，是联合国宪章的具体化。就在1955年6月联合国成立十周年纪念会上，杜勒斯把许多侵略性条约例如北大西洋公约、马尼拉条约和巴黎协定等，说成是“每一个都体现了联合国宪章的基本原则”，“它们把宪章的……理想付诸实施，它们是在宪章的原则下起作用的。”在1955年3月8日的马尼拉条约理事会会议上，杜勒斯又说：“美国在联合国宪章的范围内，参加了各项共同安全条约，其中包括朝鲜、日本、台湾、菲律宾、南越、老挝、柬埔寨、泰国、马来亚、巴基斯坦、澳大利亚和新西兰等……。”
    这样，美国政府就陷于它自己编织的矛盾的罗网中。如果违反宪章的侵略条约可以被硬说成是符合于联合国宪章来大量缔结，而真正符合于宪章的苏美条约反恰恰因其符合于宪章而加以拒绝，那么人们就只能得出一个结论：美国拿联合国宪章作为一个方便的工具来推行它的侵略性军事集团政策，来阻挠国际互信合作的加强，来保持国际紧张局势。
    杜勒斯就是在这样的考虑下宣扬他的“战争边缘”政策的。美国对待国际关系的这种态度不能不引起全世界爱好和平力量的坚决反对。
    美国政府还寻找其他的种种“理由”，为自己拒绝苏联和平建议的行为辩护。据说苏美条约的缔结，可以“造成一种错觉，认为挥动一下笔杆就可以得到事实上只有通过精神的改变才能得到的结果，而实际上不利于和平事业。”各国爱好和平的人士决不能同意这样的意见。缔结苏美条约就是一个实际行动，它就能成为增进美苏人民友谊的杠杆，并使那些“冷战”专家和新战争的鼓吹者受到道义上的约束。日内瓦四国首脑会议就是一个明显的例子。这个会议表示的加强国际合作的信念和良好融洽的气氛，给予国际局势的发展以有力的推动。在这个意义上，苏联重申北大西洋集团和华沙条约国之间缔结条约的建议仍然有效，是有着非常现实的根据的。美国政府对苏美条约表示“怀疑”，恰恰说明它们完全看到这个条约的重大作用，只是由于害怕国际局势的进一步和缓，才制造出各种遁辞。
    布尔加宁的两次信件，有力地说明了苏联真诚地希望和美国和平共处，希望能通过美苏关系的改善来和缓国际局势。信件中的建议完全切实可行。而美国政府的反应则使美国统治集团的真面目暴露无遗。人们不会不同意印度“新世纪报”的评论，它说：美国政府的拒绝，清楚地表明美国统治集团“反对缓和世界紧张局势，他们希望进行他们的战争准备。”
