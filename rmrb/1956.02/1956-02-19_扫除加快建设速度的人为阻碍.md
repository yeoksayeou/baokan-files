Title: Eliminate Man-Made Obstacles Hindering Construction Speed

The Northwest Second Engineering Company's First Engineering Zone was contracted to build a batch of dormitory buildings. According to the design, it required 120,000 grey bricks and over 2.8 million red bricks. However, so many red bricks could not be purchased locally, only grey bricks. They proposed to the construction unit to use grey bricks instead of red bricks. However, the construction unit disagreed, arguing that grey bricks were more expensive than red bricks, and using grey bricks would exceed the state's control targets. In fact, a red brick was only 0.8 fen cheaper than a grey brick, and using grey bricks entirely would only cost 20,000 yuan more than using red bricks. This would not have a significant impact on the cost of nearly 20,000 square meters of building construction. However, the construction unit insisted that they had no way to bear this price difference. The two sides argued about this for a month, postponing the start date by a month.

Before the issue of grey and red bricks was settled, these two units began to argue about the issue of grey and red flat tiles. According to design requirements, the dormitory buildings would use a total of 107,000 red flat tiles. The construction unit proposed that there were ready-made grey flat tiles nearby, and requested that the red flat tiles be replaced with grey flat tiles. The construction unit felt that grey flat tiles were more expensive and was unwilling to use them. In fact, each red flat tile was only 5.1 li cheaper than a grey flat tile, a total difference of 545 yuan for 107,000 tiles, while the transportation cost to transport red flat tiles from Baqiao, more than 20 kilometers away, would be more than 1,500 yuan. If the construction unit considered the overall interest, regarding the loss of transportation costs as a loss to the state, rather than a loss to Party A or Party B, they would have agreed to use grey flat tiles. Unfortunately, they did not think this way. When discussing who would bear the transportation costs, they said: "We are contracted for both labor and materials, and we don't care about the material price difference." The two sides have been arguing about this matter since December 19th last year, and it has not ended as of early February this year. The building is about to start tiling, but there is not a single tile on site.

Some people believe that arguing over small matters is unavoidable. Indeed, in complex capital construction work, arguing over small matters is unavoidable. However, this unavoidable argument should be for the overall interest, not for "who suffers a loss" or "who takes advantage"; and both sides should quickly reach a consensus under the principle of safeguarding the overall interest to ensure the normal progress of the project. This is a beneficial argument. The kind of argument mentioned above is not for safeguarding the overall interest, but disregarding the progress of the project and arguing for a long time. This is a harmful argument, also known as "buck-passing." This intolerable "buck-passing" is the great enemy of capital construction. In order to eliminate man-made obstacles to accelerate construction speed, we must concentrate our firepower on all buck-passing phenomena, defeat it, and eradicate it.

    扫除加快建设速度的人为阻碍
    朱波
    西北第二工程公司一工区承建一批宿舍楼房工程，按照设计，需要青砖12万块，红砖280多万块。但是，当地买不到这么多红砖，只有青砖。他们就向建设单位提出用青砖代替红砖。但是，建设单位不同意，理由是青砖比红砖贵，如果用青砖就会突破国家控制指标。实际上，一块红砖比一块青砖只便宜8厘，全部改用青砖后比用红砖贵2万多元，这对将近2万平方公尺的楼房工程的造价是不会有多大影响的。然而，建设单位坚持说这笔差价他们没有办法负担。为这件事情双方扯了一个月的皮，使开工日期推迟了一个月。
    青红砖的问题还没有扯清，这两个单位又为青红平瓦的问题扯起皮来。按设计要求，宿舍楼房共用107，000块红平瓦，施工单位提出附近有现成的青平瓦，要求把红平瓦改为青平瓦。而建设单位嫌青平瓦贵，不愿意用。实际上，每块红平瓦比青平瓦只差5厘1毫，107，000块瓦共差545元，而到20多公里远的坝桥去运红平瓦，运费比这还多1，500多元。如果建设单位从整体利益出发，把运费的损失看做国家的损失，而不看做甲方的或乙方的损失，就会同意用青平瓦了。可惜，他们没有这样想，当谈到运费由谁来负担的时候，他们说：包工包料，材料差价多少我们管不着。双方从去年12月19日开始为这件事争执不休，一直到今年2月初还没有结束。目前楼房要开始砌瓦了，可是现场上一块瓦也没有。
    有人认为为小事情争执是不可避免的。的确，在复杂的基本建设工作中，为小事情争执是不可避免的。但是，这种不可避免的争执，应该是为了整体利益，而不是为了“谁吃亏”、“谁占便宜”；而且双方应该在维护整体利益的原则下，很快统一意见，保证工程的正常进行。这种争执是有益的争执。像上面所说的那种争执，不是为了维护整体利益，而是不顾工程的进度，长久地争吵下去。这是有害的争执也就是所谓“扯皮”。这种不可容忍的“扯皮”，是基本建设的大敌。为了给加快建设速度扫清人为的障碍，我们必须向一切扯皮现象集中火力，打倒它、铲除它。
