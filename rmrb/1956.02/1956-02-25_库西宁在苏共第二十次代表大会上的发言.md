Comrades! On the international stage, we are now experiencing a great historical process in which the masses of the people and many nations are shifting from the sphere of imperialism to a position of opposing imperialism and defending peace. The great socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, is gaining more and more friends in other countries. The people of these countries, due to their own immediate interests, are increasingly supporting the international policies of our party and our country on all the most important issues of the day.

The international policy pursued by our party and its Central Committee in the period covered by the report is a brilliant Leninist policy that has broken away from dogmatism and pedantry. The great achievements of the Soviet state have been achieved on the basis of concretely developing Lenin's international policy in accordance with the new situation.

In the course of the Soviet state's unremitting struggle for the relaxation of international tension and the peaceful coexistence of the two systems, we have put forward many politically bold, constructive, and problem-solving proposals. I would like to draw your attention to the valuable experience we have gained in this regard, and to cite some specific examples. We must learn not only from mistakes, but also from new and good experiences.

The first example. As everyone knows, the debate about the nature of the Atlantic Group has been going on for many years. We say that this is an aggressive military group against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Western diplomats, on the contrary, insist that this group does not threaten anyone, and that it was supposedly established to defend peace. Here, one statement is pitted against another, and the truth should be proven by facts.

The facts prove that the Soviet Union was right. Moreover, the evidence was presented by the imperialists themselves. This happened in 1954, when the Soviet Union boldly suggested to the Western countries that negotiations be held to discuss the issue of the Soviet state joining the Atlantic Group. However, the Western countries rejected this proposal, thus exposing the truth about the Atlantic Alliance in front of the people of all countries, and confirming that it is a military group that does not allow outsiders to join, and that its purpose is not defense, but aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

The second example. In order to paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries, Western countries use the guise of "collective security" to cover up their military and political activities in Europe. Therefore, the Soviet Union proposed the conclusion of an all-European collective security treaty, inviting all European countries to participate in this treaty. The representatives of the imperialist countries tried their best to avoid this, and they found a beautiful excuse, saying that the conclusion of such a convention would inevitably exclude the United States from European affairs. However, when the Soviet government replied that the Soviet Union had no objection to the United States joining the European Collective Security Treaty, their excuse fell through. What was the result? This time, the representatives of the Western countries had nothing to say. They had to avoid this proposal in silence.

The third example. Western countries have been saying that they want to achieve "universal supervised disarmament." But they only have empty words, without any action. On the contrary, they have intensified the arms race year after year, imposing more and more military taxes on their own people. Atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs are openly used to arm the Atlantic Group. At this time, the Soviet Union expressed its agreement to disarmament, and set a completely different example, reducing its army by 640,000 people, and abolishing its last military base abroad.

The Soviet Union has also taken resolute and bold actions in the United Nations to strive for disarmament. In order to prevent the issue from becoming deadlocked, the Soviet Union even submitted a proposal to the United Nations Council that was consistent with the Western countries' own proposals not long ago. What was the result? In order to avoid taking any concrete action, the Western countries did not hesitate to break their own words. So they had to remain silent again, as if they had had their tongues cut off.

In this way, it is as if an open trial has been conducted against the instigators of a new war in front of the people of the world. Of course, the defendants are trying to evade responsibility, insisting that the accusation seems to be "Soviet propaganda." But the problem is: now it is not only our words, but mainly their own actions that confirm their guilt. Their own actions and decisions confirm that the accusation can be established. Every time they reject the peaceful proposals put forward by the Soviet Union that are in line with the vital interests of mankind, they create new evidence of their guilt. Did the Soviet Union suggest that they do this? On the contrary, the Soviet Union's proposals always give them an opportunity to exonerate themselves as long as they can give a positive answer. Since they have repeatedly undermined the "Geneva spirit" after their "Cold War" has obviously gone bankrupt, then they—the aggressive imperialists—are bound to be isolated, because their evidence of guilt is increasing year by year, and these evidences are of decisive significance to the people's verdict.

The situation was the same with regard to the issue of continuing the war in Korea and later continuing the war in Vietnam. As a result, American imperialism finally fell into shameful isolation and had to retreat with its tail between its legs.

Comrades! The process of imperialists being exposed and confessing is now unfolding particularly rapidly in Asian countries such as India, Burma, and Indonesia, which have recently gained liberation, and in some places it is unfolding very fiercely. In such a situation, the Anglo-American declaration recently issued in the name of the Anglo-American rulers cannot but arouse people's amazement. This declaration states: "We... are committed to the goal of self-government and independence for all countries whose peoples desire and are able to maintain an independent existence." It goes on to say: "In the past ten years, nearly 20 countries with 600 million men and women have established countries with our support and assistance."

Comrades! Look, what should we say about this statement? This is truly a disgusting farce! (Lively atmosphere in the audience). They want to make us believe that the colonialists are not the enslavers of the colonial people, but their enthusiastic liberators. All adults have always believed, and also know, that the 600 million people mentioned above got rid of the colonial shackles through their long struggle against the colonialists. But now, we hear such absurd claims that the colonialists themselves will dismount, and have always been dedicated to the independence of all countries."

In fact, it is quite surprising to see the famous imperialists putting on the brilliant armor of the fighters for freedom for the colonial people. Not only is it surprising, but it is also laughable.

For example, it is not difficult to imagine what impression the great Chinese people would have if they were told that the American government, which armed China's enemies, as mentioned in the Washington Declaration... had helped the Chinese people liberate themselves from the clutches of the imperialists and the Kuomintang traitors! It is also easy to guess what the people of India, Burma, Malaya, and Egypt would think if they were told that British rule seemed to be helping them get rid of colonial oppression. To be honest, this kind of stupid hypocrisy will completely lose the last bit of respect that the past and present colonial people have for Britain and the United States!

When the Soviet leaders were in India and Burma, they said: We are happy for you to have gotten rid of colonial oppression and are now building your own independent countries. When they said these words, no one in India or Burma had any doubts about their sincerity. But, comrades, if Churchill or other representatives of British imperialism were to say such things there, you can imagine what the reaction would be, and who would believe their sincerity?

No, the colonialists are not sincere, and for them, sincerity is dangerous. Dulles, who issued a controversial statement on the Portuguese-occupied Indian territory of Goa, felt this. It is true that some people believe him, that he is wholeheartedly on the side of the colonialists, but this has not saved his reputation.

The British Conservative newspaper "Daily Mirror" offered "smart" advice for this: "The West should invent (!) diplomacy that can gain the trust of others." However, it is quite obvious that even the most sophisticated diplomacy can hardly guarantee that people will believe in policies that run counter to the interests of the people.

British imperialists have been in India for a long time, a very long time, but they are very poor at learning about India. (Laughter, applause) The representatives of our country, Comrades Khrushchev and Bulganin, were only there for a few weeks, but we all understood something important about India. (Prolonged applause) For example, we know that "Panchsheel" is a great force. (Stormy, prolonged applause) This force is no less effective than all the forces of the Asian military groups established by the colonialists.

We also know that the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to the people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan in the industrialization of their countries is a true socialist attitude towards the people of these countries. This assistance has laid a solid foundation for the firm friendship between the people of these countries. The world knows how important results have been achieved in establishing sincere and lasting friendly relations between the Soviet state and India, Burma, and Afghanistan. Not long ago, the consolidated friendship between our country and Yugoslavia was re-established. I don't need to elaborate on how much the direct contact made by Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev during their visits to these countries played in these areas, which is also known to the world.

Speaking of this, it is necessary to point out the important political significance of the fact that Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Bulganin correctly recognized the significant role played by Mahatma Gandhi in the history of the Indian people in their speeches in India. In this way, Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Bulganin took the lead in correcting the sectarian errors reflected in the remarks of Soviet orientalists and in the documents of the Communist International in previous years. As everyone knows, Gandhi's philosophical views are far from those of Marxism-Leninism, and some of our political commentators fell into one-sidedness simply by criticizing his philosophical views, to the point of completely denying Gandhi's positive historical role.

To this, I would like to add a few words. Our historians and propagandists also have reason to critically study and revise some of our other publications, such as the famous theses on colonial issues of the Sixth Congress of the Communist International. Specifically, I am referring to those assessments and evaluations of the role of the national bourgeoisie in colonial and semi-colonial countries in this thesis. This evaluation was tinged with a certain sectarianism when the aforementioned theses on colonial issues were drafted. Under the current changed conditions, due to the greatly increased prestige of the Soviet Union, this evaluation is fundamentally inconsistent with the actual situation.

Comrades! All of us, the representatives of the 20th Congress, are very happy because we see that the summary report of the Party Central Committee presents us with the great goals of our struggle, clearly indicates the true Leninist line of the Party's policy and the Party's magnificent new tasks.

We also welcome with satisfaction the new position of our party on the issue of the possibility of preventing war, as stated by Comrade N.S. Khrushchev in the summary report of the Central Committee. This position is fully in line with the current situation and will help the struggle to safeguard the cause of peace, because the arguments on this issue in the past have reduced the effectiveness of the struggle to prevent a new war in previous years.

The issue of various different forms of transition to socialism in different countries not only has important theoretical significance. The new formulation of this issue is based on a synthesis of Lenin's remarks and new historical experiences, and it will have direct practical significance for the work of the Communist Parties in capitalist countries. I think it is particularly important that this explanation of the issue will be able to promote the fraternal Communist Parties' struggle to overcome the political split of the working class. There is no doubt that many Social Democratic workers will agree with the view that the road to socialism is not the same for all countries, as straight as Nevsky Prospekt.

The Communists have taken a big step forward in creatively mastering theory and historical experience, which will obviously be one of the particularly valuable achievements of this Congress. In the report of the Party Central Committee and in the speeches of Comrades Mikoyan, Suslov, and Shepilov, sharp, high-level, and beneficial criticism was made of various forms of dogmatism and pedantry in ideological work. It should be hoped that this criticism will effectively help those Soviet organs and Party cadres who have these problems to break away from the shackles of dead dogma in political thought and scientific thought.

Dear Comrades! We are deeply convinced that our Party, which builds its entire policy on the unshakeable foundation of Marxism-Leninism, will achieve further achievements and victories. Our Leninist Party is united, and it is now more capable than ever of fulfilling the historical role of the vanguard of progressive humanity.

This ability of our Party can be evidenced by the outstanding achievements that the Party Central Committee has made in its work, which are reflected in the summary report of the Central Committee made by Comrade Khrushchev, and the resolution of the Congress will undoubtedly express deep satisfaction with these achievements, because they have actually been approved by the entire Party and the entire country. (Applause)

Our Party can justly be proud of the fact that the Party's collective leadership has so successfully and excellently solved the very complex and arduous tasks in the period discussed in the summary report. As everyone knows, the leadership core of the Central Committee has shown such a high degree of proactivity, initiative, and agility throughout the entire period, has shown such a truly Bolshevik foresight on problems and possibilities in any situation, and has shown such an outstanding ability to apply Lenin's brilliant policy in new ways under new circumstances, which has actually exceeded all our expectations. (Applause) It is this leadership that can guide the Party to make greater efforts and achieve greater victories in the future. I think this is the common opinion of the representatives of this Congress. (Applause)

Due to the significant economic achievements made in recent years, our socialist country has become stronger than ever before. And it must be a strong country. The international status of our great country—the world's first socialist country—requires it to be a strong fortress for guaranteeing universal peace and the freedom of all peoples. This situation requires every Soviet person to work with an extremely high sense of personal responsibility and collective responsibility in order to further strengthen the power of our socialist motherland.

Our road forward is clear. It leads to the highest goal of mankind—a communist society. The great Soviet people, under the leadership of their beloved Leninist Party and its Central Committee, will carry the cause to the victory of communism! (Stormy, prolonged applause)

    库西宁在苏共第二十次代表大会上的发言
    同志们！在国际舞台上现在正经历着一个人民群众和许多民族从帝国主义范围内转向反对帝国主义、保卫和平的立场的巨大的历史性过程。以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的伟大的社会主义阵营，正在其他国家内获得越来越多的朋友。这些国家的人民，由于自己切身的利益，越来越拥护我们的党和我们的国家在当前一切最重要的问题上的国际政策。
    我们的党和它的中央委员会在报告涉及的时期内所执行的国际政策，是摆脱了教条主义和学究气的英明的列宁主义的政策。苏维埃国家的巨大成就就是在根据新形势具体发展了列宁的国际政策的基础上取得的。
    在苏维埃国家坚持不懈地为争取缓和国际紧张局势和两个制度的和平共处而斗争的过程中，我们这方面提出了许多在政治上是大胆的、建设性的和解决问题的建议。我要请大家注意我们在这方面所取得的宝贵经验，而且要举出一些具体的例子。要知道，我们不但能够和应该从错误中学习，而且也能够和应该从新的好的经验中学习。
    第一个例子。大家知道，关于大西洋集团的性质的争论已经继续了好多年了。我们说，这是反对苏联和人民民主国家的侵略性军事集团。西方国家的外交家却相反，他们硬说这个集团是不威胁任何人的，而且据说，它是为了保卫和平而建立的。在这里，一种说法和另一种说法针锋相对，谁是谁非，应当用事实来证明。
    事实证明苏联是正确的。而且，证据还是由帝国主义者自己提出的。这是1954年的事情，苏联当时大胆地向西方国家建议进行谈判，讨论苏维埃国家加入大西洋集团的问题。但是西方国家拒绝了这个建议，这样一来，它们就在各国人民面前暴露了大西洋联盟的真相，自己肯定了它是一个不许外人加入的军事集团，它的目的不是防御，而是侵略苏联和人民民主国家。
    第二个例子。为了麻痹各国人民的警惕性，西方国家用“集体安全”的幌子来掩盖自己在欧洲所进行的军事和政治勾当。于是苏联就建议缔结全欧洲的集体安全条约，吸收一切欧洲国家来参加这个条约。帝国主义国家的代表们千方百计避开这一点，他们找了一个漂亮的借口，说缔结这样的公约势必拒美国于欧洲事务之外。但是，一当苏联政府回答说苏联毫不反对美国加入欧洲集体安全条约的时候，他们的遁辞就落空了。结果如何呢？这一次西方国家的代表们已经无话可答。他们只好默不作声地避开了这个建议。
    第三个例子。西方国家一直口口声声地说他们是想求得“普遍的有监督的裁军”。但是他们只有空话，没有一点行动。相反地，他们年复一年地加紧军备竞赛，把愈来愈多的军事的苛捐杂税加在本国人民的身上。原子弹和氢弹公开被用来武装大西洋集团。就在这个时候，苏联则表示同意裁军，并且作出了完全不同的榜样，它把自己的军队裁减了64万人，并且取消了自己在国外的最后一块军事基地。
    苏联在联合国里也采取了坚决大胆的行动来争取裁减军备。为了使问题不致陷于僵局，苏联甚至向联合国的理事会提出了同西方国家自己不久以前的提案相一致的提案。结果怎样呢？西方国家为了避免采取任何具体的行动，竟不惜背弃自己讲过的话。于是他们又只得默不作声，好像被割掉了舌头一样。
    这样，就好像是在全世界人民面前对新战争挑拨者进行了公开的审判。当然，被告是企图逃避责任的，他们硬说控诉似乎是
  “苏联的宣传”。但是问题在于：现在不光是我们的话，而且主要是他们自己的行动证实了他们的罪过。他们自己的行为和决定证实了控诉是能够成立的。每一次当他们拒绝苏联提出的符合于人类切身利益的爱好和平的建议的时候，他们都为自己的罪过制造了新的证据。难道是苏联建议他们这样做的吗？恰恰相反，苏联的建议总是给他们一种机会，只要他们能够作出正面的答复，他们就能够开脱自己。既然他们在自己的“冷战”显然破产以后，又一再破坏“日内瓦精神”，那末他们——侵略成性的帝国主义者也就必然要陷于孤立，因为他们的罪证正在逐年增加，这些罪证对人民的判决来说是有着决定性的意义的。
    在关于在朝鲜继续进行战争的问题以及后来在越南继续进行战争的问题上，情况就是这样的。结果是，美帝国主义终于陷于可耻的孤立，而不得不夹着尾巴退走。
    同志们！帝国主义者被揭露和自招的过程，现在在印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等不久以前获得解放的亚洲国家中正特别迅速地展开，而在有的地方则正在非常激烈地展开。在这样的情况下，最近由英美执政者的名义发表的英美宣言就不能不引起人们的惊讶，这个宣言这样说：“我们……致力于使一切该国人民希望而且能够保持独立生存的国家得到自治和独立的目标。”接着又说：“在过去十多年间，将近20个国家的6亿男女在我们的支持和援助下建立了国家。”
    同志们！你们看，对这种声明应该怎么说呢？这真是一种令人作呕的滑稽表演！（全场活跃）。他们想使我们相信：殖民主义者不是殖民地人民的奴役者，而是他们的热心的解放者。所有的成年人一直到今天都认为，而且也知道，上面提到过的6亿人民是通过自己对殖民主义者进行长期斗争才摆脱了殖民枷锁的。而现在，我们却听到这种荒唐的说法，说什么殖民主义者自己会下马，并且是从来都献身于各国人民的独立的”。
    实在说，看到著名的帝国主义者竟穿起为殖民地人民争取自由的战士的灿烂的盔甲，不能不令人十分惊异。不光惊异，而且也令人觉得滑稽可笑。
    例如，不难想像，华盛顿宣言中所说的什么武装了中国的敌人的美国政府……曾经帮助中国人从帝国主义者和国民党卖国贼的魔掌中解放出来等等这种话，会使伟大的中国人民产生怎么样的印象！如果对印度、缅甸、马来亚和埃及的人民说，英国的统治好像是为了帮助他们摆脱殖民压迫，那末这些国家的人民会作何感想，这也是很容易猜想得到的。老实说，这种愚蠢的伪善行为，会使得过去和现在的殖民地人民对英国和美国的最后一点尊敬也完全丧失的！
    苏联的领导人在印度和缅甸的时候说：我们为你们摆脱了殖民主义压迫和现在正在建设自己独立的国家而感到高兴，当他们说这些话的时候，在印度或是在缅甸谁也没有对他们的真诚产生任何怀疑。可是，同志们，如果是丘吉尔或者英国帝国主义的其他什么代表人物也是在那里说这样的话，你们可以想像到，反应会怎样，谁会相信他们的真诚呢？
    不，殖民主义者是不会真诚的，而且对他们来说，真诚是危险的。就葡萄牙占领下的印度领土果阿发表了引起议论的声明的杜勒斯，对这一点是有所感受的。不错，有人相信他，他是彻头彻尾地站在殖民主义者的一边，但是这并没有挽回他的声誉。
    英国保守党报纸“每日镜报”为此提出了“聪明的”忠告：“西方应该发明 （！）可以取得别人信任的外交”。但是，十分显而易见的是，即使是最圆滑的外交也难以保证使人相信同人民利益相抵触的政策。
    英国帝国主义者在印度很久，十分久，但是他们在学会了解印度方面是很差的。（笑声，掌声）我们国家的代表，赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志在那里只有几个星期，但是我们大家都了解了印度的某种重要的东西。（经久不息的掌声）譬如，我们知道，“潘查希拉”这是伟大的力量。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）这种力量在效力上不次于殖民主义者所建立起来的亚洲军事集团的全部力量。
    我们还知道，苏联对印度、缅甸和阿富汗人民在他们国家的工业化事业上作的无私的的援助，就是对这些国家人民抱的真正的社会主义态度。这种援助为我们这些国家人民之间的牢固的友谊奠定了可靠的基础。全世界都知道，在建立苏维埃国家同印度、缅甸、阿富汗之间的真诚和永久的友好关系方面，已经取得了多么重要的成果。在不久以前，我国同南斯拉夫之间的巩固友谊已经重新建立起来了。我不必再细说，布尔加宁同志和赫鲁晓夫同志在访问这些国家的时候所作的直接接触，在这些方面起有多么大的作用，这也是全世界都知道的。
    谈到这里，必须指出这样一个事实的重要政治意义：赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志在印度发表的讲话中正确地承认了圣雄甘地在印度人民历史中所起的显著作用。这样，赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志就在行动上率先纠正了前些年反映在苏联东方学家的言论中和共产国际的文件中的宗派主义的错误。大家知道，甘地的哲学观点同马克思列宁主义的观点相差很远，我们的某些政论家仅仅从批判他的哲学观点出发而陷入了片面性，以至完全否认了甘地有积极意义的历史作用。
    对此，我想补充说几句，我们的历史学家和宣传员也有理由批判地研究和修订我们的某些其他出版物，例如，著名的共产国际第六次代表大会关于殖民地问题的提纲。具体讲，我指的是这个提纲中对殖民地和半殖民地国家的民族资产阶级的作用的那些评定和估价。在拟定上述关于殖民地问题的提纲的时候，这种估价就带有一定的宗派主义色彩。在当前改变了的条件下，由于苏联的威信大大提高，这种估价就根本不符合于实际情况了。
    同志们！我们大家，第二十次代表大会的代表，都感到十分欢欣鼓舞，因我们看到，党中央委员会的总结报告向我们提出了我们的斗争的伟大目标，十分明显地指出了党的政策的真正列宁主义的路线和党的宏伟的新任务。
    我们也很满意地欢迎尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在中央委员会的总结报告中所陈述的我们党在防止战争的可能性问题上的新立场。这一立场完全符合当前的情况，将有助于维护和平事业的斗争，因为过去在这个问题上的论点已经在前几年中减低了防止新战争的斗争的效力。
    关于各个不同的国家过渡到社会主义的各种不同的形式的问题，不仅具有重大的理论意义。这个问题的新的提法是以列宁的言论和新的历史经验的综合为根据的，它对资本主义国家的共产党的工作将会有直接的实际意义。我认为特别重要的是，对这个问题的这种解释将能够促进兄弟共产党克服工人阶级政治分裂的斗争。毫无疑问，许多社会民主党的工人都会赞同这样的观点：
  过渡到社会主义的道路并不是所有的国家都是一模一样的、像涅瓦大街那样笔直的。
    共产党人在创造性地掌握理论和历史经验方面已经迈进了很大的一步，这显然将是这次代表大会的特别宝贵的成果之一。在党中央委员会的报告中以及在米高扬、苏斯洛夫、谢皮洛夫这几位同志的发言中，都对思想工作上的形形色色的教条主义和书呆子习气进行了尖锐的、高度水平的和有益的批评。应当希望，这种批评将有效地帮助那些有这些毛病的苏维埃机关干部和党的干部在政治思想和科学思想方面摆脱死教条的束缚。
    亲爱的同志们！我们深信，把整个政策建筑在马克思列宁主义的不可动摇的基础上的我们的党，将会获得进一步的成就和胜利。我们的列宁的党是团结一致的，它现在比任何时候都更有能力完成进步人类先锋队的历史作用。
    我们党的这种能力可以由党中央委员会在工作中获得的那些大家知道的卓越成果作明证，这种成果反映在赫鲁晓夫同志所作的中央委员会的总结报告中，大会的决议无疑地会对这些成果表示深感满意的赞同，因为它们实际上已经受到全党和全国的赞同了。（掌声）
    我们的党可以正当地感到自豪的是，党的集体领导已经这样胜利地和出色地解决了总结报告所谈到的时期中十分复杂的和艰巨的任务。大家知道，中央委员会的领导核心在整个时期发挥了这样高度的积极性、主动精神和机敏性，对任何情况下的问题和可能性表现了这样真正布尔什维克的远见，以及在新的情况下表现出按照新的方式运用列宁的天才政策的卓越能力，这些实际上都超出了我们的一切意料。（掌声）正是这种领导能够引导党今后作出更大的努力和取得更大的胜利。我认为，这是这次代表大会的代表们的共同意见。（掌声）
    由于最近几年来所取得的重大的经济成就，我们的社会主义国家已经比从前任何时候都更加强大了。而且它也必须是一个强大的国家。我们伟大的国家——世界上第一个社会主义国家的国际地位要求它必须成为保障普遍和平和各国人民的自由的强大的堡垒。这种情况使每一个苏联人必须以极其高度的个人责任感和集体责任感进行工作，以便进一步加强我们的社会主义祖国的威力。
    我们的前进道路是明确的。它引向人类的最高目标——共产主义社会。伟大的苏联人民在自己亲爱的列宁的党和它的中央委员会的领导下，将把事业进行到共产主义的胜利！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
