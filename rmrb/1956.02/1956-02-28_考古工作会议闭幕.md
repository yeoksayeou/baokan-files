Archaeological Work Conference Closes

The archaeological work conference, which lasted for 7 days, concluded on the 27th. The conference conducted thorough discussions on the plans, guidelines, and tasks for future archaeological work. Archaeologists presented 26 special reports on archaeological excavations at the meeting and engaged in free academic debates.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, and experts in archaeology, history, and other fields attended the closing ceremony on the 27th. At the closing ceremony, Xia Nai, Deputy Director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Wang Yeqiu, Director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, delivered summary reports on archaeological academic matters and archaeological work arrangements, respectively.

The conference pointed out that in order to make archaeological work more plentiful, faster, better, and more economical, it is necessary to tap potential strength, vigorously train cadres, master advanced scientific methods, improve professional standards, and strengthen cultural relic protection and general survey work. The conference suggested that the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant departments formulate a comprehensive plan for archaeological work, stipulate the steps to be taken, ensure that Chinese archaeology approaches or reaches the international advanced level within 12 years, and solve the pressing problems in history that have not yet been resolved. The conference also suggested that the Ministry of Culture formulate comprehensive regulations on the protection of cultural relics such as ancient tombs and ancient ruins, as well as specific methods for protecting and managing cultural relics, such as general surveys and registration, and issuing licenses.

The conference called on archaeological workers across the country to actively study Marxist-Leninist theory and professional skills, criticize bourgeois idealist thinking, carry out criticism and self-criticism, strengthen unity, correct academic style, improve the quality of work, and strive to approach and reach the world's advanced level; to cooperate closely with various basic construction departments, and, based on the principle of both benefiting engineering progress and benefiting cultural relic protection, work with engineering personnel to do a good job in the protection of cultural heritage.

In order to further learn advanced experiences and methods of archaeological work, improve the scientific level of archaeological work, and exchange work experiences more widely, the conference decided to hold an archaeological academic conference in 1957. (Xinhua News Agency)

    会议指出：为了把考古工作做得又多、又快、又好、又省，必须发掘潜在力量，大力培养干部，掌握先进科学方法，提高业务水平，加强文物保护和普查工作。会议建议中国科学院和有关部门制定出考古工作的全面规划，规定进行步骤，保证中国考古学在12年内接近或赶上国际先进水平，并且解决历史学中还没有解决的迫切问题。会议并且建议文化部制定出全面的有关古墓葬、古遗址等文物的保护条例，以及普查登记、发执照等具体的保护管理文物办法。
    会议号召全国考古工作人员要积极学习马克思列宁主义理论和业务，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，开展批评和自我批评，加强团结，端正学风，提高工作质量，为接近和赶上世界先进水平而努力；要同各基本建设部门紧密合作，在既利于工程进行，又利于文物保护的原则下，和工程人员共同把文化遗产保护工作做好。
