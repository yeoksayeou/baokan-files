    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the special reports of other leading comrades. As a medical education worker, I especially realize that the two reports by Chairman Zhou Enlai and Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo are of great educational significance and deeply enlightening to me. I sincerely wish to take the medical and health and scientific research work pointed out in these two reports during the great socialist revolution as the direction of my future efforts and the goal of my struggle in the task of medical education.

    Currently, the people of the whole country are enthusiastically throwing themselves into socialist construction. However, some diseases, like hidden counter-revolutionaries, will not only constantly hinder us but even destroy our construction, especially some diseases that will seriously affect the further improvement of agricultural production. Therefore, it is necessary to first, within a certain period, in all possible places, basically eliminate some diseases that can weaken the labor force and even take lives, just like those diseases proposed in the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, such as schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, kala-azar, encephalitis, plague, malaria, smallpox, and venereal diseases, which is very correct and achievable.

    The strong leadership and determination of the Party and the government, as well as the enthusiastic support of the masses, are the most important guarantees for eliminating these diseases. At the same time, the scientific technology of scientific workers, including medical and health workers, is also an indispensable part of the struggle to complete this great task. Not only that, but our medical and health workers are soldiers standing on the front line in carrying out this combat mission. We can only advance step by step and are not allowed to retreat even a single step. Therefore, the responsibility of our medical and health workers is extremely heavy and also very glorious.

    Especially, among these diseases, such as schistosomiasis, could not be eliminated during the reactionary rule period, and even in many capitalist countries, it can never be eliminated. However, now we can definitely see that within a few short years, in our country, this disease will be eliminated cleanly from one region after another. We are beginning to carry out what Chairman Mao Zedong said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before." We will also tell the idealists in capitalist countries in the world that only in such a superior new social system can there be the power to gradually eliminate this disease. Therefore, the task before us is extremely glorious, and the responsibility is also very heavy.

    In undertaking such an extremely glorious and heavy responsibility, our medical and health workers must first examine whether our medical and health workers themselves can complete this task. It can be said with certainty that we are fully capable. However, at the same time, it is absolutely impossible to deny, and even more strictly, we must face up to the fact that our medical and health workers still have some shortcomings inherent in general senior intellectuals that can affect the work. These shortcomings are mainly insufficient political awareness and a strong right-leaning conservative ideology. This will seriously affect our medical and health workers' ability to exert their enthusiasm and potential, and thus greatly hinder our struggle against these diseases. Therefore, in the task of preventing and treating and researching these diseases, we must first overcome these shortcomings.

    Overcoming these shortcomings must rely on serious study to achieve ideological transformation and thereby improve the will to serve the people. Moreover, we must consciously and actively put forward such requirements from the bottom of our hearts. Only in this way can we give full play to our enthusiasm and all potential; can we achieve the timely and even early completion of the arduous task of eliminating these diseases. In the task of fighting these diseases, there is another thing of equal importance, that is, to seriously learn from the Soviet Union's principled advanced experience in eliminating infectious diseases, and to learn humbly from traditional Chinese medicine, and under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine, adopt the proven prescriptions and good medicines of traditional Chinese medicine for treating these diseases. This will play a great role in our elimination of the nine most harmful diseases.

    Another issue, from our perspective as medical educators, is that we also have a major responsibility, which is to cultivate new forces. Facing the upsurge of socialist construction, the number of medical and health personnel we need is far behind the requirements of the development of the objective situation. At the same time, in order to make our medical achievements approach the world's advanced level within a certain period, our medical scientific research team really needs to be greatly strengthened and expanded. Therefore, in addition to devoting ourselves to teaching and research, we medical educators must also overcome conservative ideas, give full play to our enthusiasm, and do our best to cultivate more outstanding young people for the country to engage in medical and health work and medical scientific research work.

    Since liberation, the Party and the government have been very caring and concerned about intellectuals. This can be specifically illustrated by educating us through various movements to improve our political awareness and ideological level, and by attaching importance to science, enriching equipment, and creating favorable conditions for our scientific workers in teaching and research. However, despite the Party and the government's care and concern for us, if we measure the quality and quantity of the teaching or research work we have done against the requirements of the development of the objective situation, then we must admit that what we have done is far from enough. The main reason is still that our political awareness is not high enough, and conservative ideas are still at play. Therefore, I believe that intellectuals, including our scientific workers, should break out of a room full of gas that is suffocating and desperately ask to breathe a breath of fresh air, and ask for self-reform from the bottom of their hearts. It should be said that we should have such a realization now. At the same time, the fact that our work is lagging behind the requirements of the situation does not mean that there are no objective problems. For example, too many meetings and social activities make it impossible to guarantee the time necessary for teaching and scientific research, which is a very common phenomenon and often makes us feel unspeakable distress. Some schools do not have complete libraries, which seriously hinders scientific research work. We believe that these problems will be reasonably resolved in the near future.

    Before ending my speech, please allow me to summarize: Let us, under the leadership and education of the Party and the government, strive to consciously and actively make demands for self-reform, to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and thereby improve our awareness of serving the people; contribute all our strength, and strive to eliminate the nine major diseases that endanger socialist construction and to make our medical science achievements approach the world's advanced level.

    My political theory study is insufficient, and my view of problems is not comprehensive enough. Therefore, if there are any inappropriate points, please offer criticism and corrections.

    姚永政的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和其他各位首长的专题报告，作为一个医学教育工作者，我特别体会到周恩来主席和郭沫若副主席的两个报告对于我的教育意义很大，启发很深。我衷心地愿意根据这两个报告中所指出的在伟大社会主义革命过程中所应进行的医药卫生和科学研究工作，作为我今后在医学教育任务中的努力方向和奋斗目标。
    现在，全国人民正在热烈地投身在社会主义建设中。但有些疾病好像暗藏的反革命分子那样，不但会不断阻碍我们甚至会破坏我们的建设，特别是有些疾病会严重地影响农业生产的进一步提高。因此，必须首先在一定时期内，在一切可能的地方，基本上消灭一些能够削弱劳动力甚至夺去生命的疾病，正如同中共中央政治局在1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要的草案中所提出的那些疾病，例如血吸虫病、血丝虫病、钩虫病、黑热病、脑炎、鼠疫、疟疾、天花和性病，是非常正确的而且是做得到的。
    党和政府的坚强领导和决心，以及群众的热烈支援，是消灭这些疾病的最重要的保证。同时，科学工作者包括医药卫生工作者在内的科学技术，也是在完成这种伟大任务的斗争中不可缺少的一部分。不但如是，而且我们医药卫生工作者在进行这种战斗任务中是属于站在最前线的战士，我们只有节节前进不许后退一步，因此我们医药卫生工作者的责任是极其重大的，同时也是非常光荣的。
    尤其是，在这些疾病中，例如血吸虫病，不但在反动统治时期中不能消灭，即使在许多资本主义国家内也绝对不能消灭。但是，现在我们可以肯定地看得到在不长的几年内，在我们国家内，这种病将会从一个地区接着一个地区中被消灭干净。我们正在开始执行着毛泽东主席所说的“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。我们也将会告诉世界上资本主义国家的唯心主义者，只有处在目前这样一个优越的新的社会制度中才能有力量把这种疾病逐步加以消灭。所以，摆在我们前面的任务是极其光荣，而责任也是非常重大的。
    在负担起这样一个极其光荣而责任又很重大的任务中，我们医药卫生工作者必须首先要检查一下我们医药卫生工作者的本身能不能够完成这个任务。可以肯定地说，我们是完全能够的。但是，同时也绝对不能否认，而且严格地进一步讲，必须正视我们医药卫生工作者还存在着一般高级知识分子所具有的能够影响工作的一些缺点。这些缺点主要是政治觉悟不够和右倾保守思想还浓厚。这就会严重地影响我们医药卫生工作者发挥积极性和潜在力，因而可以大大地阻碍了我们对于这些疾病的斗争。因此，在和这些疾病进行防治和研究的斗争任务中，我们必须首先克服这些缺点。
    克服这些缺点必须依靠认真的学习，来达到思想改造，进而来提高为人民服务的意志。而且，必须自觉地主动地从内心中出发提出这样要求。只有这样，才能发挥积极性，发挥所有的潜在力；才能对于消灭这些疾病的艰巨任务，做到按期胜利完成甚至提前完成。在和这些疾病进行的斗争任务中，还有一件具有同样重要意义的事，就是要认真向苏联学习关于消灭传染病的一些原则性先进经验，以及要广泛向中医虚心学习，在中医的指导下采用祖国医学中对于医治这些疾病的验方良药。这将会对于我们消灭危害最大的九种疾病起着极大作用。
    另一个问题，从我们作为医学教育工作者来讲也负有重大责任的，就是培养新生力量。面临着社会主义建设的高潮，我们需要医药卫生人员的数目远远落后于客观形势发展的要求。同时为了使我们医学的成就在一定时期内接近世界先进的水平，我们医学科学研究的队伍实在有大大地加强和扩大的必要。因此，我们医学教育工作者除致力于教学与研究外，还必须同样地克服保守思想，发挥积极性，尽自己最大的力量为国家培养出更多的优秀青年来从事医药卫生工作和医学科学研究工作。
    解放以来，党和政府对于知识分子是十分爱护和关怀的。这可从通过各种运动来教育我们，提高我们的政治觉悟和思想水平，从重视科学、充实设备、为我们科学工作者创造了教学上和研究上有利条件等事实，来具体地说明。但是尽管党和政府这样爱护和关怀我们，如果从客观形势发展的要求来衡量我们做的教学工作或研究工作的质和量，那么，我们应当承认我们所做的是远远的不够了。主要原因，同样由于政治觉悟还不够高，保守思想还在作怪。因此，我认为知识分子，包括我们科学工作者在内，要好像从充满着煤气逼得透不过气来的房间突破出来，急迫地要求呼吸一口新鲜空气那样，来从内心中出发要求自我改造。应该说，现在应该是有这样认识了。同时，我们工作落后于形势的要求，也不是说没有一些客观问题的存在。例如过多的开会和社会活动使教学和科学研究的进行中所必需的时间得不到保证，是一个很普遍的现象，往往使我们感觉到说不出的苦闷。有些学校还没有完备的图书馆，使科学研究工作受到严重阻碍。我们相信，这些问题在不久的将来会得到合理的解决的。
    在结束我这发言以前，请允许我总结一句：让我们在党和政府的领导和教育下，努力自觉地主动地作出自我改造的要求，来肃清资产阶级思想残余，克服右倾保守思想，进而提高为人民服务的觉悟；贡献出自己一切力量，为消灭危害社会主义建设的九大疾病，为使我们医学科学的成就接近世界先进水平而奋斗。
    我的政治理论学习是不够的，看问题不够全面。因此，有不妥当的地方，请提出批评和指正。
