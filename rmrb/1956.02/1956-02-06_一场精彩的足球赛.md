    A Wonderful Football Match
    Lin Wen
    On the afternoon of February 5th, the friendly match between the Yugoslav Youth Football Team (hereinafter referred to as the South Team) and the Beijing Football Team (hereinafter referred to as the Beijing Team) was the most interesting event in the amateur life of the capital's people this Sunday.
    An hour before the game, the Xian Nong Tan Stadium was already packed with more than 20,000 spectators. Outside the stadium gates, many people were still waiting for an unexpected opportunity to enter. The Central People's Broadcasting Station used all its wavelengths to broadcast the grand occasion of the game.
    At exactly 3 o'clock, the players from both sides entered the stadium amidst the enthusiastic applause of the audience. At 3:05, the game began, and the South Team launched an offensive. The midfielders and defenders of the Beijing Team also stood their ground, blocking the attack of the South Team's five very active forwards. At the fourth minute, the Beijing Team's midfielder passed the ball over the center line, and the forwards quickly advanced, passing into the South Team's penalty area. In the melee, they once shot the ball into the South Team's net, but this goal did not count because of offside. In the first 30 minutes of the first half, because the Beijing Team's defenders defended tightly, the South Team's forwards had few opportunities to cut into the Beijing Team's penalty area, so the South Team often resorted to long shots from outside the penalty area, 20 meters or even nearly 30 meters away. But they were all saved and cleared by the Beijing Team's goalkeeper, Xu Fusheng. At the 37th minute, the South Team's right winger, Liboszynowicz, received a pass from Doplarak, dodged the Beijing Team's defender's block, and scored a powerful shot from about 13 meters away, opening the scoring. After losing a point, the Beijing Team worked hard to counterattack, and the forwards adopted a rapid offensive tactic. Exciting scenes often appeared in front of the South Team's goal. The South Team led 1-0 in the first half.
    Three minutes after the start of the second half, the South Team's forwards used clever short passes, and the ball quickly cut in from the left. The Beijing Team's defensive line also concentrated more on defending the left line. The South Team's left winger, Birlingiewicz, while dribbling the ball, suddenly lobbed the ball to the right winger, Liboszynowicz. Liboszynowicz took two steps with the ball and entered the penalty area. The Beijing Team's defender, Wang Defa, quickly rushed back to close in. Liboszynowicz dodged and shot with his foot. The ball passed through Wang Defa's legs, blocking the Beijing Team goalkeeper's line of sight. By the time he hurriedly tried to save, the ball had already entered the net. The score became 2-0. Then, the Beijing Team's midfielder, Chen Chengda, got the ball in the center line and dribbled straight to the front of the South Team's penalty area. While the South Team's defender was intercepting, he passed the ball to the left winger, Han Wensong. Han Wensong then made a high lob towards the center. The ball landed behind the right inside forward, Jin Longhu. Jin Longhu turned around and made a back heel shot. Although this kick was good, it unfortunately went out of bounds to the left. At the 17th minute, the South Team's Doplarak broke through in the middle and scored the third goal. Two minutes later, the Beijing Team launched a full-scale counterattack. Center forward Shi Wanchun used a feint to dodge the opponent's defender and passed the ball low to the right forward in the penalty area. The right forward then passed it lightly to the left. The left inside forward, Sun Fucheng, happened to arrive and kicked the ball into the net. The Beijing Team also opened the scoring. Afterwards, the offensive of both sides was still very frequent, but no more goals were scored. The final score was 3-1, and the South Team won.
    This wonderful game fully demonstrated the excellent skills of the South Team players, especially the tacit understanding in passing and the speed and accuracy of shooting, which gave the audience a deep impression. (Attached picture)

    一场精彩的足球赛
    林文
    2月5日下午，南斯拉夫青年足球队（以下简称南队）和北京足球队（以下简称北京队）的一场友谊比赛，是首都人民在这个星期日的业余生活中最感兴趣的一件事情。
    离开比赛还有一个小时，先农坛运动场上已经挤满了两万多观众。在运动场的门外，还有不少人伫候着有意外的入场机会。中央人民广播电台把全部波长都用来广播这场比赛的盛况。
    3时正，双方队员在观众们热烈的掌声中进入了运动场。3时5分，球赛一开始，南队就展开了攻势，北京队前卫和后卫也扎住了阵脚，阻挡了极为活跃的南队的五个前锋的进攻。四分钟的时候，北京队前卫传球过中线，前锋迅速挺进，传进南队禁区。在混战中，曾把球射入南队网里，但因越位，这个球不算。在上半场的前30分钟里，因为北京队后卫防守得严密，南队的前锋切进北京队禁区的机会不多，所以南队常采取在禁区外作20公尺甚至近30公尺的远射。但都被北京队守门员徐福生扑救解围。到37分钟的时候，南队右翼利包希诺维契得到多泼拉克传过来的球，闪开了北京队后卫的阻挡，在13公尺左右的地方一记劲射，打开了记录。北京队失了一分以后，努力反击，前锋采取了快速进攻的战术，南队门前也常出现惊险的场面。上半时南队以一比○领先。
    下半时开始后的3分钟，南队前锋运用巧妙的短传，球从左边迅速切进。北京队的卫线也较集中左线的防卫。南队左翼比尔林切维契在盘球挺进中，突然把球远吊给右翼利包希诺维契。利包希诺维契带上两步，已进入禁区，北京队后卫王德发迅速赶回紧迫，利包希诺维契一闪身就举脚射门，球从王德发的胯下穿过，北京队守门员的视线被挡，待急忙抢救时，球已进了网里。比数成二比○。接着，北京队前卫陈成达在中线得球，直线带到南队禁区前，在南队后卫阻截中，把球传给了左翼韩文松，韩文松随即往中高吊，球落在右内锋金龙湖的后面，金龙湖转身反钩，这一脚踢得虽好，可惜偏左出界。到17分钟，南队多泼拉克中间突破，攻进了第三个球。两分钟以后，北京队全力反攻，中锋史万春用假动作闪过了对方的守卫，低传给在禁区内的右锋，右锋又往左轻传，左内锋孙福成正好赶到一脚，球应声入网，北京队也打开了记录。以后双方的攻势依然很频繁，但都没有建立功绩，全场比赛三比一，南队获胜。
    这场精彩的比赛，充分表现了南队队员优秀的技术，特别是在传球的默契和射门的迅速和准确，给了观众很深的印象。（附图片）
