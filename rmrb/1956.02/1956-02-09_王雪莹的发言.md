Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I am a chemical science and technology worker. After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai and other leaders' reports on intellectuals, and Chairman Mao's call to us intellectuals to strive to catch up with the world's scientific level rapidly, the question of "how to reach the world's scientific level" has become the discussion center and guiding force of our scientific workers. To accomplish this historic task, I personally have three shallow opinions, please correct me.

(1) As our motherland marches towards science, how should our broad masses of women dedicate their strength? Based on my observations of the role women played in agricultural cooperativization in the countryside, I estimate that the potential of our women is limitless. In Gaolong Township, Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, there is a village where Lin Meifang lives. She is an elderly widow in her 50s with two sons and a daughter, none of whom can be considered strong labor. She wanted to join a mutual aid team, but no one welcomed her, so she had to organize with two other households to start mutual aid production. The other two households were one with a disabled person and one, like Lin Meifang herself, also a widow. They started a mutual aid team led by Lin Meifang. At the time, they were ridiculed as the "Shrimp Team." "Shrimp Team" - that is to say, "Shrimp cannot make big waves." The following year, this mutual aid team with only three households actually resisted disasters and increased production, and was rated as a first-class mutual aid team. In 1953, this team expanded to 20 households, and the production volume reached 600 jin per mu, 100 jin higher than the local yield per mu. In 1954, it was converted into a cooperative, and now it has expanded to 113 households. Due to continuous years of increased production, Lin Meifang herself has also received the glorious title of "Model" for consecutive years. From this example, it vividly illustrates that if this newborn force had not been supported and nurtured by the Party, the old woman Lin Meifang, who had been buried in feudal society for a long time, would not have been able to be discovered and grow.

Our broad masses of women have had little opportunity to learn culture due to past feudal oppression, so there are very few of them on the scientific and technological front. Our Party and government have made a series of efforts to cultivate women and have achieved brilliant results. To further expand our women's ranks on the scientific front in the future, it is hoped that, in accordance with the principle of mobilizing both men and women, all effective measures will be taken, just as in the countryside, to give them sufficient conditions to exert their enthusiasm and creativity. Because women are a newborn force, they especially need promotion, support, and cultivation from all aspects. I believe that if all the strength of women is tapped, it will definitely play a decisive role in the future march towards science.

(2) Scientific and technological workers should also frequently report their work to the people like political and economic workers, otherwise, the people will not understand what you have done for them. Today's people are eager to understand science. When I visited Huangyan Agricultural School in Zhejiang Province on December 6 last year, when talking about how the agricultural school serves agriculture, the vice-principal of the school, Ji Guanglong, replied: "Before 1953, there was a thought in teaching that teaching is teaching and cannot be combined with farmers. After 1953, due to the establishment of mutual aid teams, farmers first took rice pests to the agricultural school to ask, and then began to have contact with farmers. Due to the enlightenment of the farmers, Huangyan Agricultural School opened a 'Field Exhibition' in 1954, which the farmers were very satisfied with, and gradually established a relationship. A political teacher said: 'I teach politics in the agricultural school, I don't engage in agriculture, but once you come into contact with farmers, as long as you are from the agricultural school, no matter what you do, they will ask how to increase production and how to improve technology. The questions raised by the farmers make me unable to answer.'" He said that he still has to learn agricultural knowledge well in the future. Because farmers need scientific knowledge, it has also promoted the progress of the agricultural school. If scientific language can be vividly conveyed on the scientific front, making scientific language the language of the people, so that the people know the importance of science, the broad masses of people will contribute their valuable experience accumulated over thousands of years to us and support us. More importantly, under the influence of socialist education, the 600 million people must frequently welcome and support the new forces and achievements of scientific creation. Combining the greatness of science with the great power of the people, will our scientific cause not rapidly catch up with the world's level? Popularizing science is our current important task as scientific workers.

(3) Our scientific workers are relatively easy to accept the truth and believe in the truth. Since I knew that there is such a selfless Communist Party in the world, I truly believe in it as I believe in the truth. In the past six years, I have been constantly educated and nurtured by the Party, and my way of thinking and political consciousness have been improved to a certain extent, but it is still far, far away from the standard of a Communist Party member. The decadent idea of "self-cultivation" of intellectuals is still very serious in my consciousness. It is mainly manifested in the work of expanding the team and uniting internal forces, and I have not made any contributions in recent years. There are still many problems in our scientific and technological workers' ranks. The relationship between leaders and scientific and technological workers is still not "unreserved." I often hear people say: "I was a tough bone in the old society, I didn't lick boots. Now that I'm in the new society, my bones are still tough, and if people don't pay attention to me, do I have to stick to them?" Some say: "I work hard, but anyway, I don't feel happy doing things. The actions of senior scientific and technical cadres must be approved by the youth team leader, without any authority." The "conservatism" of intellectuals is still very strong. The existence of these situations shows that the combination of our scientific workers with workers and peasants and the leadership of the Party are not yet of one mind, and further proves that in today's climax of the socialist revolution, further self-education of our intellectuals is very urgent. The Chinese Communist Party has led the people to create incomparable broad prospects and visions for Chinese scientists. Our being of one mind with the Communist Party is certainly a matter of gratitude, but the most important thing is that in the future march towards the scientific fortress, we need the guidance of Marxism-Leninism even more. We are not only scientists, but also should be Marxists-Leninists, and improve our understanding of Marxism-Leninism through professional practice and observation. Only by demanding ourselves in this way can we march towards science and accelerate catching up with the world's scientific level.

    王雪莹的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我是一个化学科学技术工作者。我听了周恩来主席及各位首长有关知识分子报告以及毛主席向我们知识分子提出迅速赶上世界科学水平而奋斗的号召以来，“怎样达到世界科学水平”这个问题，已成为我们科学工作者的讨论中心和行动的指导力量了。为了完成这一历史任务，我个人有三点粗浅意见，请各位指正。
    （一）在祖国向科学大进军的时候，我们的广大妇女应该怎样才能献出自己的力量呢？根据我在农村中所看到妇女在农业合作化中所起的作用来估计，我们妇女的潜在能力是不可限量的。浙江温岭县高龙乡一村里的林梅芳，她是50多岁的老年寡妇，有二子一女，都还够不上说有劳动力。她想参加互助组，但什么人也不欢迎她，因此她只好和另外二户组织起来开始互助生产。另外二户，一户是残废的，一户和林梅芳自己一样也是寡妇，他们就这样干起了一个由林梅芳领导的互助组。当时被人讥笑为“虾子组”。“虾子组”——那就是说“虾子作不了大浪”。第二年，这个只有这样三户的互助组，居然抗拒灾害，增了产，就被评为一等互助组。1953年这个组扩大到20户，生产量每亩达到600斤，高出当地每亩产量100斤。1954年转为社，现在已扩大到113户。由于连年增产，林梅芳本人也连年得到光荣“模范”称号。由这个例子来看，很生动地说明了，这支新生的力量假如没有党的支持和培养，长期埋藏在封建社会里的老太婆林梅芳就不可能得到发掘和成长。
    我们广大妇女由于过去受封建压迫没有机会学习文化，因此在科学技术战线上数量很少。对于妇女的培养，我们党和政府已作了一系列的努力，并获得了辉煌成绩。对今后扩大我们妇女在科学战线上的队伍，也希望根据男女一齐发动的方针，也像对待农村中的妇女一样，采取一切有效措施，让她们有足够条件发挥积极性和创造性。因为妇女是一支新生的力量，特别需要各方面的提拔、支持与培养。我相信如果把妇女全部力量加以掘发，对今后的科学大进军，必然能起决定性的作用。
    （二）科学技术工作者，应该也学政治工作人员、经济工作人员经常向人民报告自己工作，否则的话，人民将不了解你为人民做了些什么。今天的人民是迫切需要了解科学。去年12月6日访问浙江省黄岩农校时，说到农校如何为农业服务问题，该校副校长纪广隆回答说：“1953年以前在教学方面存在一种思想，教学管教学，与农民结合不起来，1953年以后，由于互助组的成立，农民首先拿了稻害虫到农校去问，才开始与农民有了接触。由于农民的启发，黄岩农校在1954年开了一个‘田间展览会’，农民看了很满意，才逐步建立了关系。有一位政治教员说：‘我在农校是教政治的，不搞农业，但一接触到农民，只要你是农校来的，他不管你是搞什么的，他就要问怎样提高产量，怎样改良技术，农民提出的问题，使我不能回答。’”他表示今后还得很好地学习农业知识。由于农民需要科学知识，因此也推动了农校的前进。如果能将科学语言在科学战线上很生动地传达出来，使科学语言成为人民的语言，人民都知道科学的重要，广大人民群众将他们几千年留下来的宝贵经验贡献给我们，支持我们。更重要的是在社会主义教育的影响下，六亿人口对科学创造的新生力量和成果必需经常加以欢迎和支持。把科学事业的伟大与人民伟大力量相结合，我们的科学的事业还不迅速赶上世界水平吗？宣传科学是我们科学工作者的当前重要任务。
    （三）我们科学工作者是比较容易接受真理、相信真理的。自从我知道世界上有这样大公无私的共产党以后，我的确相信他真如相信真理一样。六年来受到党的不断教育和培养，我的思想方法和政治觉悟都有了一定的提高，但以共产党员的标准来衡量自己还是差得很远很远。知识分子“独善其身”的腐朽思想，在我的意识中还是十分严重的。主要表现在扩大队伍团结内部力量的工作上，几年来没有做出贡献。在我们科学工作者队伍里，还存在着不少问题。领导与科学技术工作者之间尚不能“相处无间”。我常听到人说：“我在旧社会里是硬骨头，拍马屁是不干的。现在到新社会里骨头还是硬的，人家不来睬我，难道硬挨上去吗？”有的说：“工作我是努力干的，反正做事做得不痛快，高级的科学技术干部一举一动都得听青年组长批准，没有一点权限”。知识分子“故步自封”还是十分浓厚的。这些情况的存在，说明了我们科学工作者和工农的结合和党的领导还不够一条心，更证明我们知识分子在社会主义革命已达到高潮的今天，进一步的自我教育是非常迫切的。中国共产党领导人民为中国科学家创造了无可比拟的壮阔前途和远景，我们和共产党一条心，固然是饮水思源，但最主要的在今后向科学堡垒进军，更需要马克思列宁主义的思想指导。我们不仅是一个科学家，同时也应该是一个马克思列宁主义者，通过专业的实践和观察，来提高马克思列宁主义的认识。只有这样来要求自己，才可能向科学进军，才可能加速度赶上世界科学水平。
