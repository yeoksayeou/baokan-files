Rural Cultural Work Must Catch Up
Hukuan County Cultural Center, Shanxi Province

From April 1953 to the end of November 1955, the Hukuan County Cultural Center spent almost three years experimenting with 13 agricultural cooperative clubs throughout the county in a scattered manner. We used to think that building 13 clubs in three years was not slow, but after the county party committee held an expanded three-level cadre meeting on rural work, we established 47 clubs within a month, from mid-November to mid-December.

Isn't this too fast? Can they be consolidated? The answer is: it should be. Look at the facts:

In the winter of 1955, Hukuan County built 605 semi-socialist cooperatives. This new situation brought a new demand from the farmers – a cultural demand. Whether it was the masses of farmers or the staff, they were dissatisfied with the fact that there were more than 600 cooperatives in the county, but only 13 clubs. They said, "More than six hundred, only a dozen! Who gets to be entertained, who gets to sit?" "Cooperativization advances a thousand miles a day, but cultural work is like an ox cart; agricultural production is good and fast, but cultural work can't keep up!" At the propagandist meeting held by the county party committee, 13 clubs were notified, but 27 came. They said, "We have no experience to share, but we want to learn!"

Due to the influence of the established clubs, the masses' demand to establish clubs has become a practical action. We revised the club development plan 5 times before it was finalized. Originally, we planned to establish 100 clubs in 1956, and we thought we were advanced! As a result, each village's current plan is to ensure that 160 are established before the Spring Festival. Shihemu is a mountainous area, and we originally knew that they had a library, so we planned to ask them to talk about their experience in running a library at the club cadre training class, in order to stimulate the mountainous area and lay the foundation for running clubs. Who knew that they stood up and introduced how they established the club committee, how they divided shares, and how they carried out activities. The people in the audience listened very attentively. Finally, the comrade who spoke said: "Our club has been established for 3 months, and now the Cultural Center still says we are a library, and will only establish a club for us next year! Isn't this a joke?"

The enthusiasm of the masses for establishing clubs is beyond our imagination.

In the past, rural areas usually only had activities to perform operas during the Spring Festival, and things cooled down after the 15th day of the first lunar month. Now, however, more than 50 villages started rehearsing operas in November. During the rest time from winter production, the clubs held bayin concerts in the fields. People said this was "the club going down to the fields." Through the guidance of the song and dance troupe in Hukuan, song and dance activities were carried out throughout the county. Men and women in Changxing, Beihang and other villages in the Taihang Mountains all started dancing. People said, "Song and dance have come up the mountains." Guo Xiaoze, a middle school student from Baichi Village, was given the heavy responsibility of the club by the party branch, and sent him to the county for training. But his mother was ill, and Guo Xiaoze wanted to go to study, but was worried about his mother's illness. Although his mother was ill, she was unwilling to stop her child from going to study. Later, the party branch secretary found out and said to Guo Xiaoze: "If you want to go, your mother's illness will be taken care of by the cooperative." Xiaoze's mother said with emotion: "Xiaozhe, you must learn your skills well, run the club well, and be worthy of the Party." After hearing that the county's song and dance troupe was going to their village for guidance, the Weiguo Agricultural Cooperative sent a large cart early in the morning to pick up the song and dance troupe. When the song and dance troupe arrived at Chuandi, the club organized more than 70 people to learn song and dance every day. On December 27, the Chuandi Club organized an evening party in Qinzhuang. Wang Wangxing, a 67-year-old man, also went on stage with a cane. He said, "I have loved to sing all my life. Before liberation, because of the rule of the Kuomintang and the Japanese invaders, I simply stopped singing. Now my eldest child is in the People's Liberation Army, and my second child is a cooperative cadre. I have been allocated so much grain this year that I can't eat it all, and I have long been so happy that I want to sing!"

The high enthusiasm of the masses for culture has given us great encouragement. Really, cooperativization advances a thousand miles a day, how can cultural work be like an ox cart? The final plan for the development of rural clubs in Hukuan County has finally been determined: in 1956, the county decided to establish 328 clubs, that is, one for each cooperative. Starting next year, we will focus on consolidation and improving quality. This plan has been conveyed at the three-level expanded cadre meeting, and some village cadres are so happy that they don't know what to say.

With so many clubs and so few staff in the Cultural Center, we can't take care of them all, so we can only rely on the central clubs for guidance. Our central clubs are divided into two types. One type is the old clubs that provide guidance to the surrounding townships. These central clubs are directly cultivated by the Cultural Center, and their scope can reach a guiding area. The other type is the central clubs run by the townships, which are led by the general party branch. The central clubs have the responsibility of leading and organizing the clubs in the surrounding villages, and can also uniformly mobilize and concentrate activities. In peacetime, each village club operates independently. In this way, a club network will gradually be formed.

    农村文化工作要赶上去
    山西省壶关县文化馆
    壶关县文化馆从1953年4月起到1955年11月底以前，差不多三年的时间，在全县范围内，插花式地试办了13个农业合作社俱乐部。三年办了13个，以前我们还觉得不慢，但是县委召开农村工作三级扩大干部会议以后，从11月中旬至12月中旬一月内就办起了47个。
    这可太快了吧？能巩固下来吗？回答是：应该这样。请看事实：
    1955年冬，壶关县全县建成了605个半社会主义性质的合作社。这种新的情况，农民来了个新的要求——文化要求。不管是农民群众也好，工作人员也好，对当时县里合作社有600多个、而俱乐部只有13个的情况，是不满意的。他们说：“六百多，十几个！该谁娱乐该谁坐？”“合作化日行千里，文化工作像个牛车；农业生产又好又快，文化工作跟不上来！”在县委召开的宣传员会议上，通知了13个俱乐部，结果却来了27个。他们说：“俺没经验介绍，但要来学一学呀！”
    由于已建立的俱乐部的影响，群众要求办俱乐部已成了实际行动。我们订的俱乐部发展规划，修改了5次才定了案。原先我们计划1956年办100个，还以为是先进哩！结果各村现在订了的计划是：春节前保证办好160个。石河沐是个山区，我们原知道他们有个图书室，因此打算请他们在俱乐部干部训练班上谈一下办图书室的经验，以便刺激一下山区，打下办俱乐部的基础，谁知人家站起来就介绍了他们如何成立了俱乐部委员会，怎么分了股，怎样进行活动，在场的人听的很得劲。最后，那位发言的同志说：“我们俱乐部办起来3个月了，现在文化馆还说我们是图书室，明年才给我们办俱乐部哩！这不是笑话？”
    群众对办俱乐部的热情，是我们想像不到的。
    过去农村要演戏，一般是到春节才活动，过了15就冷下来。如今呢，11月开始排戏的，就有50多个村。在冬季生产的休息时间，俱乐部就在地头举行八音会，人们说这是“俱乐部下了地”。通过歌舞团在壶关的辅导，全县开展了歌舞活动，太行山的常行、北行等村男女都跳起了舞。人们说“歌舞上山来了。”百尺村郭孝则是个中学生，党支部把俱乐部的重担给了他，派他到县上受训。但是他母亲病了，郭孝则想去学习，又耽心母亲的病。母亲虽是有病，又不肯不叫孩子去学习。后来党支部书记知道了，对郭孝则说：“你如果愿去的话，你娘的病由合作社照顾。”孝则娘感动地说：“孝则，你要学好本领，办好俱乐部，对得起党。”卫国农业合作社在听说县的歌舞团要到他们村去辅导以后，一早就派了大车来接歌舞团，歌舞团到了川底，俱乐部就组织了70多人每天学歌舞。12月27日川底俱乐部在秦庄组织晚会，67岁的王旺兴老汉手拄拐棍，也上了台。他说“我一辈子爱唱，解放以前，因为国民党和日寇统治，我干脆不唱了，现在我大孩子是解放军，二孩子是合作社干部，我今年分下了粮吃不了，早就乐的我想唱啦！”
    群众要求文化的这种高涨的热情，给予我们很大的鼓舞。真的，合作化日行千里，文化工作怎能像牛车呢？壶关县发展农村俱乐部的最后规划终于确定了：1956年全县决定办328个俱乐部，即每社办一个，明年起着重巩固和提高质量。这个计划已经在三级扩大干部会上传达了，乐的些村干部真不知说啥是好。
    俱乐部办的多，文化馆人员少，怎么也照顾不过来，只有依靠中心俱乐部来进行辅导。我们的中心俱乐部分为两种，一种是老俱乐部对周围的乡进行辅导，这些中心俱乐部是由文化馆直接培养的，它的范围可达到一个辅导区；另一种是以乡办的中心俱乐部，由党总支领导，中心俱乐部有领导和组织周围各村俱乐部的责任，还可以统一调动、集中活动。在平时，各村俱乐部单独活动。这样就会逐渐形成一个俱乐部网了。
