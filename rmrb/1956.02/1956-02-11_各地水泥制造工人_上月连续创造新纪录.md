Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Since the beginning of this year, cement manufacturing workers across the country have continuously set new production records. According to statistics from 15 state-owned and centrally managed joint state-private cement plants, a total of 29 new cement kiln production records were created in January. This number is more than all the new records that appeared in all cement plants across the country in 1955.

The person in charge of the Building Materials Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry told our reporter: The emergence of these new records has raised cement production to a higher level. In January, all cement kilns in the state-owned Guangzhou Cement Plant created new records. Among them, the No. 3 cement kiln created a new factory record on January 21, with an average hourly production of 13.92 tons of cement clinker. This figure exceeded the average hourly production quota for 1957 by 36%. According to statistics, the average hourly output of cement kilns in state-owned and centrally managed joint state-private cement plants increased by 8.71% in January this year compared with December 1955. These factories produced more than 20,000 tons of cement more than the state plan in January this year.

    各地水泥制造工人
    上月连续创造新纪录
    据新华社10日讯　今年以来，各地水泥制造工人连续创造生产新纪录。据15个国营和中央管理的公私合营水泥厂统计，1月份创造的水泥窑产量新纪录共有29次。这个数字比1955年全国所有水泥厂出现的新纪录还多。
    重工业部建筑材料工业管理局负责人对本社记者说：这些新纪录的出现，把水泥的生产提到更高的水平。1月份，国营广州水泥厂所有的水泥窑都创造了新纪录，其中三号水泥窑在1月21日创造了平均每小时生产水泥熟料13.92吨的全厂新纪录，这个数字超过了1957年平均每小时生产定额的36％。据统计，国营和中央管理的公私合营水泥厂水泥窑平均每小时的产量，今年1月份比1955年12月份提高了8.71％。这些厂今年1月份比国家计划多生产了两万多吨水泥。
