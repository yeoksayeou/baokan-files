Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

	A letter from the Agricultural Products Procurement Department: The letter from the Supply and Marketing Section of the State-run Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1, published in the "Reader's Letters" column on January 8, reflecting that many tobacco leaves often contain impurities, is true. The China Tobacco Monopoly Corporation has instructed tobacco leaf acceptance personnel in various regions to strictly implement national grade standards, implement the policy of "better quality, better price," and establish a responsibility system to ensure quality specifications. Any tobacco leaves that are not suitable for use by cigarette factories are not allowed to be transferred externally.

	A letter from the Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance: After the "Reader's Letters" column published the critical letter "Urgent Documents Sleeping in Drawers" on January 15, we immediately instructed the local budget section to conduct an inspection. Comrade Han Bi, who handled this document, has already made a written self-criticism. We will strengthen the education of our cadres in the future and conscientiously improve the work of handling official documents.

	After the "Reader's Letters" column published the critical letter "As if Entering a No-Man's Land" on December 11, 1955, the Anxin County Public Security Bureau has sent a letter of self-criticism and proposed measures to improve its work.

	After the "Reader's Letters" column exposed the erroneous behavior of Gao Zhanwu, a road maintenance foreman of the Zhengjiatun Works Section of the Jinzhou Railway Administration (the original critical letter mistakenly referred to the Jilin Railway Administration), in squandering state property on December 25, 1955, the Zhengjiatun Works Section has replied and decided to demote Gao Zhanwu as a disciplinary action.

	A letter from the Yishan Local Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party of China in Guangxi: The "Reader's Letters" column published a letter criticizing Niu Guiming, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the CPC Shilong County Committee, for his privileged thinking on November 21, 1955. We have decided to give Niu Guiming a public warning within the Party as a disciplinary action.

	After the "Reader's Letters" column published the critical letter "Poor Management and Serious Losses of the Yunnan Provincial Food Company" on October 23, 1955, Zhang Hongtao, manager of the Yunnan Provincial Food Company, has sent a letter of self-criticism.
