Shanghai, February 21st (Xinhua News Agency) - In Shanghai, as of February 20th, 341 factories in the light industry sector, with more than 84,000 employees, had joined the socialist competition. Among light industry factories with a scale of 25 or more workers, over 80% of the employees have participated in the competition.

    The workers of six state-owned and joint state-private cigarette factories, in the inter-factory competition, put forward nearly 3,000 rationalization proposals. According to preliminary calculations, their adoption could increase production and save 1.8 million yuan. In the pharmaceutical, food and other industries, 41 factories saw 66 new production records in the first 20 days of this month. Tianfeng Pharmaceutical Factory, which is manufacturing tartaric emetic injections for the treatment of schistosomiasis, achieved a qualified rate of 98.46% for this injection on February 9th, setting the highest record for the qualified rate of similar product factories in the city. The daily output of canned pork at the Merlin Canned Food Factory recently reached more than 700 boxes, nearly double the average daily output in September last year.
