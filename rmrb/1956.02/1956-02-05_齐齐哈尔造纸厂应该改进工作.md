    Qiqihar Paper Mill Should Improve Work

    To the Editor:

    The Shenyang Paper Supply Station of the Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture has been ordering newsprint from the Qiqihar Paper Mill since the first quarter of 1951, according to the national unified balanced distribution plan, for use by news and publishing units in Northeast China. However, the quality of the paper from this factory is very poor. As early as the first and second quarters of 1955, we discovered that the newsprint had defects such as rough surface, insufficient gloss, fluffing, weakness, and dark color. The rolls of paper also easily broke. There were also many problems with packaging. The reams of paper were uneven, with folded corners, tears, rolled edges, inaccurate quantities, and loose packaging. The roll paper had poorly marked joints and patches. The paper-using units frequently raised concerns, but the factory did not improve quickly.

    The Qiqihar Paper Mill also pays very little attention to saving national resources. The reams of newsprint supplied in the first and second quarters of 1955 were often punctured with many holes by the workers who carried the paper when loading the trucks at the paper mill. The Liaoning People's Publishing House estimated that the damaged paper accounted for about 2%. They and the Shenyang Supply and Marketing Office of the Ministry of Light Industry notified the factory, requesting immediate improvement in the method of carrying paper. However, many of the paper shipments from the factory afterward were still damaged.

    The Qiqihar Paper Mill also frequently fails to deliver on time according to the deadlines stipulated in the contract. From April to December of last year, the total amount of paper delivered late was more than 330 tons. What is particularly serious is that they do not even bother to notify the supply and marketing departments in advance. For example, the factory could not deliver the paper for November 1955, but did not notify the Shenyang paper supply agency until December 2, making it impossible for the paper supply agency to transfer the paper in time, which almost prevented the normal publication of the "Luda People's Daily" and the "Heilongjiang Daily."

    It is suggested that the relevant superior leading organs and the supply and marketing departments of the Ministry of Light Industry correct the Qiqihar Paper Mill's consistent failure to complete its tasks. 　　　　Cui Tianting

### 齐齐哈尔造纸厂应该改进工作

    齐齐哈尔造纸厂应该改进工作
    编辑同志：
    文化部出版事业管理局沈阳纸张供应站从1951年第一季度开始，根据国家统一平衡分配的计划，订购了齐齐哈尔造纸厂的新闻纸，供给东北各新闻出版单位使用。但是这个工厂的纸张质量很不好。早在1955年第一、二季度，我们就发现新闻纸有纸面粗糙、光度不足、起毛、不结实和颜色黑等缺点，卷筒纸还很容易断头。在包装方面也有很多毛病，平版纸参差不齐、折角、破口、卷边、数量不准、打件不紧，卷筒纸接头和补窟窿的标记不牢。用纸单位经常提出意见，但是这个厂改进不快。
    齐齐哈尔造纸厂对节约国家物资的工作也很不注意。1955年一、二季度供应的平版新闻纸，在纸厂装车的时候经常被抬纸工人钩了许多窟窿。辽宁人民出版社统计了一下，钩坏的纸张约占2％左右。他们和轻工业部沈阳供销办事处曾通知这个厂，要求马上改进抬纸方法。但是这个厂以后发来的纸张，还是有不少是被钩坏的。
    齐齐哈尔造纸厂还经常不能按照合同规定的期限交货。从去年4月到12月，延期交货的纸共有330吨以上。特别严重的是，他们在事先还不负责通知供销部门。如1955年11月份的纸这个厂不能交出，但是到12月2日才通知沈阳纸张供应机构，使纸张供应机构来不及调运，使“旅大人民日报”和“黑龙江日报”几乎不能正常出刊。
    建议有关的上级领导机关和轻工业部的供销部门，纠正齐齐哈尔造纸厂一贯完不成任务的现象。　　　　崔田亭
