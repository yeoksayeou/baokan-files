A surge in theoretical study among officers of the People's Liberation Army is gradually taking shape throughout the army. The PLA's Beijing-based agencies and troops have already established 16 intermediate-level night schools and 24 primary-level night schools, capable of enrolling 10,000 officers. The Beijing-Tianjin Garrison has also opened more than 40 Marxist-Leninist night schools. Troops stationed in other regions and various military regions are also preparing to establish night schools. Marxist-Leninist night schools at the division level and above will be universally established throughout the army in the next two years.

Officers taking short-term leave for study have also begun their studies according to plan. The first session of the advanced cadre self-study program jointly organized by the Chengdu troops and the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party began in mid-January. General Tang Liang, the head of the Nanjing troops, personally presided over the preparation of the advanced cadre self-study program, which has gathered a group of officers at the rank of colonel and above and began studying on February 1st. More than 150 senior military officers from PLA units stationed in Beijing have taken leave and are participating in advanced cadre self-study programs organized by the Party and government systems. Many military regions are also planning to run four to five short-term training courses each year, specifically to rotate training for officers at the school level.

Officers who cannot attend schools (including night schools) or take short-term leave for study are planning to use half a day each week for study time and spare time for learning. The units stationed in Beijing are jointly training political economics instructors. The Propaganda Department of the General Political Department has also organized political economics lectures specifically for generals of units stationed in Beijing.

    人民解放军军官理论学习形成热潮
    中国人民解放军全军规模的军官理论学习逐步形成热潮。解放军驻京各机关、部队已经举办了中级夜校16所，初级夜校24所，可吸收1万名军官入学。京津卫戍部队也开办了马克思列宁主义夜校40多所。驻其他各地区的部队和各个军区也正在筹建夜校。全军师以上的马克思列宁主义夜校将在今明两年内普遍建立起来。
    短期离职学习的军官，也都按照计划开始学习。驻成都部队和中共四川省委联合举办的高级干部自修班第一期已在1月中旬开课。驻南京部队首长唐亮上将亲自主持筹办的高级干部自修班，已调集一部分上校以上的军官，在2月1日开始学习。解放军驻京各单位已有离职的高级军官150多名参加党、政系统主办的高级干部自修班。许多军区也都计划每年开办四至五期短期集训班，专门轮训校级军官。
    不能进学校（包括夜校）和短期离职学习的军官，计划利用每周半日学习时间和业余时间进行学习。驻京各单位正在联合训练政治经济学辅导员。总政治部宣传部还专为驻京各单位的将官，组织了政治经济学讲座。
