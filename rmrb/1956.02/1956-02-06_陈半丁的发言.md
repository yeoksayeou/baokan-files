Comrades and members,

I was born in the feudal era, lonely and destitute, practically a little beggar. Confused and unaware, I somehow muddled through to today, a full eighty years. Throughout my life, I have relied on my own labor to support myself, without achieving anything significant. I have always opposed officials and disdained landlords, it's just my nature. Having suffered all kinds of oppression since childhood, my yearning for socialism has never ceased, except I was concerned that socialism might never be realized, it almost became a dream. Unexpectedly, in my declining years, I have finally witnessed it. My joy and happiness are as if I have entered another world, as if I am in heaven. I can truly say that my life has not been in vain. This time, thanks to the kindness of you all, I have been brought to this assembly, such honor makes me so happy that I am almost speechless. Consequently, my shame also arises. If it were in the past, I would have had no worries, but today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, I am filled with remorse, especially considering that the work of our field has been a mess until now, with no progress at all. Seeing the high tide everywhere, I feel uneasy day and night, and I often compare it to the countryside. The so-called ink farmers, using pens to cultivate, is the same as using manual labor for production, so what's the difference from physical labor? Seeing that agricultural development has been so rapid in the past year or two, just like hearing from a Wuhan representative at the Supreme State Council meeting, reporting to Chairman Mao that the output per mu can reach as much as 560 or 70 yuan. These are all examples of successful human effort. I think if the land can achieve such strength, can't we ink farmers do the same? Whether we can do it or not depends on human effort and ideology. If ideology is not straightened out, it will harm the individual, but only one's own loss; but if it affects the group, it will be extremely harmful. Since liberation, our field has been like land, why are we restricting ourselves, why can't we develop rapidly? This is because we are delayed by ideological problems. Where is the problem? To put it simply, it's a lack of understanding and the inability to break free from some subjective prejudices. To discuss these problems, it's nothing more than a lack of humility, everyone thinks too highly of themselves. But in reality, it's not worth studying. When it comes to comparing heights, it's mostly like singing "Fan Jiang Pass," your master is female, my master is male, or else it's eating a few more bowls of rice, reading a few more books. This is speaking from the old perspective. After the establishment of art schools, some misappropriated state funds to take a trip to Japan, a stroll in England and America, or had some connections with the four major families in Nanjing. When they came back and saw the old and the young, or those who had never left home, they would show an air of smugness, looking down on everyone, as if they were full of magic weapons. It was just like Sun Wukong creating havoc in the Heavenly Palace, truly terrifying. In essence, they cannot withstand your examination. Foreigners see them as a thumbs down. By chance, encountering a clever pair of glasses, shining on their faces, everything is clear in terms of knowledge. These are all jokes from our previous three years of learning. I am simply borrowing some material from past conversations. In reality, it is only because of some past misperceptions that the development of this historically excellent tradition has been hindered. These obstacles are due to taking the wrong direction in understanding, confusing quality, materials, and tools. As the saying goes, a hair's breadth of difference leads to a thousand miles of error. This hair's breadth is precisely the proposal I am making this time. I hope the government can establish a specialized research institute for us, to attract experts from various places to discuss, cultivate middle-aged, young, and future painters, to give them mutual love and encouragement, and work together to develop and continue the excellent national tradition, and move towards a new path of art. Establish close cultural ties and unite with greater mutual love and encouragement. We must join hands and contribute our own strength to achieve the same aspirations. I ask for your guidance.

    陈半丁的发言
    诸位委员、诸位同志：
    我是生在封建时代，孤苦零丁，等于一个小叫化出身。糊里糊涂，不知不觉，混到今天，正八十个足年了。一生除了自食其力，没有什么成就。反对官僚，轻视地主，自我天质。为因从小受尽百般的压迫，盼念社会主义一直没有停止，就差社会主义许到那天才可实现，几几乎成了梦想。不意到了衰残颓废的今天，居然让我等到了。我的高兴，我的愉快，如同到了另一个世界，身在天外了。足称得起一辈子没有白来。这次又仰诸明达的厚意，把我拉到这个大会场上来，这样的光荣，真真乐得我连话都说不上来了。于是我的惭愧，也就跟踪而起。若是换在以前，却也无甚顾虑，而到了今天，在毛主席领导之下，就够我抱愧万分了，尤其想到本门做的事业，一直到今天，焦头烂额，一点没有起色，又见到处处的高潮，早晚不安于心，有时常拿着农村来比例。所谓研田者，笔耕，同是用人工来生产，与力耕何异。眼看到一两年之间，农业发展有如此神速，即如同这回最高国务会议席上，听到有一位武汉的代表，对毛主席报告，一亩地的产量，收入能达到有五百六七十元人民币之多。这都是人力成功的事迹，我想土地能做到这样的力量，难道我们研田就做不到了？做得到做不到，在乎人力和思想问题上。思想搞不通，害在个人，不过自己损失；如果累到团体上，那就为害无穷。解放以后，我们这一门，好比土地，为什么自己来束缚自己，为什么不能够发展猛进，这就为的是耽误在思想问题上。这个问题，误在什么地方呢？说起来渺乎其小的，一点认识不够，主观解脱不开一些成见关系。要论这些毛病，不外乎不肯虚心，都把自己看得太高了。但实际上，值不得去研究。讲到较量高矮，多不过如唱“樊江关”，你的师父是母的，我的师父是公的，再不然是多吃几碗饭，多看几本书。这是以老的一面说。到了有了艺专之后，有的挪国家的公款到趟日本，蹓趟英美，或在南京与四大家族有点什么声息，回来见到老的小的或未出过门的，都要显出一种洋洋得意，目空一切，好像混身都是法宝。尤如孙猴子大闹天宫的样子，真可吓杀人。实质上，经不住你一考量。国外人看来，都是些摇头票。碰巧逢到高明的一折眼镜，朝面一照，也全明白在知识上了，这都是我们初学三年的以往的笑话。我无非借题凑些话里的资料而已。实际只为过去一些错认，以致耽误了这个历史上优秀传统，发扬有了阻碍。这些阻碍，就是对认识走错了方向，把质量、资料、工具搞颠倒了。所谓失之毫厘，差之千里。这个毫厘之间，即是我今次所上的提案。希望政府，是否可以为我们设立一个专门研究场所，得以延揽各地专家讨论，培养中年、青年、以及未来画家，予以共爱共励、共同努力，来发展和继续民族优秀传统，走向艺术新建之路。建立密切文化，更加互爱互励的团结起来。要挽手同行，贡献出自己的力量，达到同样成就的愿望。求诸位指教。
