Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 4th. Gui Qionghua, wife of Chinese student Liu Yongming studying in the United States, told Xinhua reporters at the Victory Mansion in Guangzhou on the 3rd: "My husband originally wanted to return home to reunite with me and our daughter, but the American special agents scared him out of his mind. The American authorities are truly cruel."

Liu Yongming was detained in a mental hospital in the United States for six years before being released not long ago. He was tortured by American special agents during his journey back to China, and finally, under someone's manipulation, he said he wanted to stay in Hong Kong.

Gui Qionghua said: "As early as 1950, the director of the mental hospital said that Liu Yongming's health was good and he could return to China. However, the American government did not allow him to leave the United States, so they kept him in the mental hospital, causing us painful separation for so many years. And now, look at how the American special agents have tortured him! For him, it is only natural to come back and reunite with his wife and daughter.

Gui Qionghua continued: "On the night I received the news that my husband had finally been released by the U.S. Immigration Bureau, I was so excited that I didn't sleep all night. I and his brothers drafted a plan to bring him home. We plan to take him to Shanghai and rest at my sister's house. We will take good care of him. After all this, he needs good care. I believe I can help him fully recover his health.

"We plan to let him go back to his old home in Hankou to see it. We think he would like to see the Yangtze River Bridge under construction there. That would surely make him very happy. He has always intended to engage in bridge construction.

"When he wanted to go to the United States to study architectural engineering, I felt very sad, and he comforted me at that time. He said that he would study hard and be able to return within two years. He said to me: 'Our future is bright.'"

"Two years later, I took the equivalent of 400 U.S. dollars from my savings and sent it to Hong Kong to his father, asking him to transfer it to my husband, because he lacked the travel expenses to return home."

The reporter asked Gui Qionghua if she had heard that her father-in-law was now in Taiwan, requesting that Liu Yongming be sent to Taiwan.

She replied: "I cannot believe that a father would hope that his son, after so many years of separation, would not reunite with his wife and children."

Gui Qionghua herself graduated from the Guangxi Art College. She has taught in amateur schools for several years while raising her daughter.

She said: "I spent a lot of effort to raise my daughter Meimei. She is 8 years old now, look how well she has grown."

Gui Qionghua also said many angry words to those who prevented her husband from reuniting with her. She said: "This is barbaric. I cannot understand what benefit they want to gain by doing this. I believe that American mothers and wives will not approve of this practice by the American government."

She finally said: "My husband must have suffered a lot of mental pain. I hope he can come back soon."

    刘永铭的妻子桂琼华
    希望刘永铭很快回家休养
    新华社广州4日电　中国留美学生刘永铭的妻子桂琼华3日在广州市的胜利大厦对新华社记者说：“我的丈夫原来是要回国同我和我们的女儿团聚的，但是美国特务把他吓得神志不清。美国当局真是残忍极了。”
    刘永铭在美国的一所神经病院里被扣留了6年之后才在不久前被释放出来。他在回国途中一直受到美国特务的折磨，最后终于在别人摆布之下说出他要留在香港。
    桂琼华说：“早在1950年的时候，神经病院的院长就说，刘永铭的健康情况良好，可以回国。可是美国政府不让他离开美国，因此他们一直把他留在神经病院里，使我们痛苦地分离了这么些年。而现在，看美国特务们把他折磨成了什么样子！对他来说，只有回来同他的妻子和女儿团聚才是理所当然的事。
    桂琼华继续说：“在我接到我的丈夫终于经美国移民局释放的消息的那天晚上，我兴奋得整夜没有合眼。我同他的几个兄弟拟订了接他回家的计划。我们打算把他接到上海，在我的姐姐的家里休息。我们将好好地照料他。在经过这一切遭遇以后，他需要很好的调理。我相信我能够帮助他完全恢复健康。
    “我们打算让他到汉口的老家去看看。我们想他会喜欢看看那里正在修建中的长江大桥。那一定会使他感到非常高兴的。他一向打算从事桥梁建筑。
    “当初他要到美国去学习建筑工程的时候，我感到非常难过，那时他还安慰我。他说，他会努力学习，两年之内就能回来。他对我说：‘我们的前途是光明的。’”
    “两年后我从自己的积蓄里拿出相当于400块美金的款子寄到香港去给他的父亲，请他转汇给我的丈夫，因为他缺少回国的旅费。”
    记者问桂琼华她有没有听说她的公公现在台湾，请求把刘永铭送到台湾去。
    她回答说：“我不能相信一个作父亲的会希望他的儿子在经过这么多年的别离以后不去同他的妻子和孩子团聚。”
    桂琼华本人毕业于广西美术专科学校。她几年来曾经在业余学校任教，同时抚养着自己的女儿。
    她说：“我为了要扶育我的女儿美美，我花了不少力量。她现在8岁了，看她长得多好。”
    桂琼华对那些使她的丈夫不能同她团聚的人还说了许多愤慨的话。她说：“这是野蛮的。我不能理解他们这样做究竟要想得到什么好处。我相信美国的母亲们和妻子们是不会赞成美国政府的这种做法的。”
    她最后说：“我的丈夫一定在精神上受了许多痛苦。我希望他很快能回来。”
