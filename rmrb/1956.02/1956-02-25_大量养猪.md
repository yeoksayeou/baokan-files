    Raising pigs is one of the most important sideline occupations for farmers. It plays a significant role in accumulating fertilizer, supplying meat to urban and rural residents, and developing export trade. However, the development of the pig-raising industry has not been fast enough in recent years. In the first half of last year, due to various reasons, the number of live pigs decreased at one point. We must take effective measures to quickly change this situation.
    Some people advocate raising more pigs, but they believe that the feed problem is impossible to solve. In fact, China has a rich source of feed. "Pigs eat hundreds of kinds of grass, it depends on whether you look for them." Farmers have long had the experience of raising pigs well by using more roughage and less refined feed. According to a survey in Hebei Province, there are 285 kinds of roughage that can be used to feed pigs in the province, among which 17 kinds of major agricultural and sideline products can supply more than 16 billion catties annually, enough to raise 8 million pigs. In Dalian, the masses were mobilized to use roughage to raise pigs, and the number of pigs increased by more than 2.6 times from 1952 to 1954. Don't these facts most powerfully illustrate that the feed problem is not difficult to solve?
    In order to expand the source of feed, agricultural cooperatives should establish feed bases and use vacant and fallow land to grow high-yield feed crops, melons, and green manure crops. These crops have high yields, are nutritious, and pigs love to eat them. Last year, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, mobilized the masses to plant pumpkins on vacant land. Each household planted an average of more than 30 summer pumpkin plants, harvesting a total of more than 86 million catties, enough to serve as the basic feed for more than 60,000 pigs. The main function of green manure crops is to fertilize the fields. According to the experience of farmers in Zhejiang Province, cutting 500 catties of green manure per mu to feed pigs does not affect the yield of crops, but it is of great help in solving the pig feed problem.
    However, raising pigs also requires a certain amount of refined feed. If only roughage is used to feed pigs, they will not easily reach the proper fatness, and the feeding time will be prolonged, wasting a lot of roughage. In last year's unified grain purchase work, the people's committees of each province have formulated appropriate grain retention standards based on the actual local conditions, creating very good conditions for developing pig raising this year. Key pig-producing provinces and regions should also allocate a portion of miscellaneous grains within their provincial grain supply indicators to meet the needs of areas with large numbers of pigs, large export tasks, and relatively scarce feed. Oil cakes of all kinds should be used as much as possible as pig feed, and then pig manure should be used to fertilize the fields. The agricultural, grain, and supply and marketing cooperation departments of each province should jointly agree on an appropriate ratio for allocating oil cakes as feed and supply them to pig farmers as soon as possible. Bran is the main refined feed for pigs, and grain departments and supply and marketing cooperation departments in various places must do a good job in supplying it.
    Some people believe that there are still quite a few pig epidemics at present, so it is difficult to raise pigs in large numbers. This idea is also incorrect. The main reason why pig epidemics are rampant in some areas is not that pig epidemics cannot be prevented and controlled, but that the epidemic prevention work is not done well. The basic method for preventing and controlling pig epidemics is to do a good job in feeding management and livestock hygiene in peacetime, and to carry out preventive injections in a timely manner to reduce the possibility of disease. After an epidemic occurs, measures such as isolation, blockade, disinfection, and proper disposal of corpses should be implemented in a timely manner to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
    In order to do a good job in epidemic prevention, it is necessary to organize folk veterinarians, unite and use them well, and at the same time, training epidemic prevention personnel for agricultural cooperatives in a planned way, teach them livestock hygiene and epidemic prevention knowledge and the technology of injecting various vaccines. This is the basic force for preventing and controlling animal epidemics in rural areas and must be cultivated as soon as possible.
    Some people believe that agricultural cooperatives lack experience in raising pigs and should not immediately develop publicly owned pigs. This is an old idea. At present, most cooperatives do lack experience in raising publicly owned pigs in large numbers, but if we do not actively raise publicly owned pigs, where will the experience come from? Now, farmers participating in semi-socialist agricultural cooperatives account for more than 70% of the total number of farmers. The so-called development of pig raising is mainly to promote the raising of publicly owned pigs in agricultural cooperatives. Otherwise, the task of pig production will be in danger of failing. Therefore, all localities should actively lead cooperatives to develop publicly owned pigs from small to large numbers, and must not allow them to develop freely.
    While developing publicly owned pigs in agricultural cooperatives, we must also strive to organize members to raise privately owned pigs. We must never ignore the enthusiasm of farmers in this regard. Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative in Dingxian County, Hebei Province, raised breeding pigs and bred a large number of piglets. In addition to keeping some for public raising, most of them were sold to members for private raising. The price of piglets was also 5% lower than the market price. Members with financial difficulties could return the money after selling the fat pigs. The cooperative's breeding pigs provide free breeding services for the members' sows. As a result of these measures, by the end of 1955, the cooperative had a total of more than 1,600 publicly and privately owned pigs, averaging one and a half pigs per household. In that year, an average of 12,000 catties of crude fertilizer was applied per mu, and 92% of the cooperative's land could be harvested twice a year, with an average yield of 512 catties per mu, an increase of 32.6% compared to when the cooperative was first established in 1952.
    Some people worry that agricultural cooperatives raising a large number of publicly owned pigs will make it easier to occur and spread pig epidemics. In fact, the situation is just the opposite. Agricultural cooperatives are more likely to accept advanced science and technology, can concentrate the necessary funds, and are better able to prevent and eliminate pig epidemics than individual farmers. Like the Hanjiawa Agricultural Cooperative in Dingxian County mentioned above, it has already trained 3 livestock health workers who regularly go to the members' homes to check pigsty hygiene and carry out preventive injections on time. In 1955, no pig diseases occurred.
    Some people think that raising pigs is an old habit of farmers for thousands of years, and they will raise them even if we don't lead them. This idea is wrong. Farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs is often affected by various conditions. Some farmers do not want to raise more pigs because piglets are not easy to buy and there is not enough feed. Some farmers have some opinions on the work of purchasing live pigs and do not want to actively raise pigs. Some farmers believe that after joining the agricultural cooperative, the fertilizer is uniformly solved by the cooperative, and they do not have to raise pigs themselves. Some members feel that the cooperative's purchase price of pig manure is unfair, and their enthusiasm for raising pigs is not high. These problems fully illustrate that only by strengthening leadership, helping farmers to dispel various ideological concerns, and solving various practical difficulties can the pig-raising industry be developed rapidly and on a large scale. Allowing it to develop freely will not work. Zhejiang Province has specially set up an office of the Pig Production and Marketing Work Committee to strengthen leadership in this area. The number of pigs at the end of 1955 increased to 3.1 million, an increase of 21% compared to the end of June of that year. This is a clear example.
    The National Agricultural Work Conference at the end of last year decided to complete the first Five-Year Plan's task of increasing pig production ahead of schedule and in excess of the target. This means that in 1956 alone, not only must we restore the number of pigs that decreased in 1955, but also reach the first Five-Year Plan's target of increasing 138.34 million pigs one year ahead of schedule. This task is arduous. However, relying on the high socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, coupled with the increase in grain reserves in the hands of farmers, as long as we strengthen leadership, this task can be completed. We must carry out arduous work and strive to complete and overfulfill this task.

### 大量养猪

    大量养猪
    养猪是最重要的农家副业之一。它对于增集肥料，供应城乡人民肉食，发展出口贸易，都有重大作用。但是，几年以来，养猪业的发展是不够快的。去年上半年，由于各种原因的影响，生猪数量曾经一度减少。我们必须采取有效措施，把这种现象迅速改变过来。
    有些人主张多多养猪，但是对于饲料问题却认为无法解决。其实，我国的饲料来源是很丰富的。“猪吃百样草，看你找不找”。农民早有多用粗料少用精料把猪养好的经验。据河北省调查，全省可以喂猪的粗料有285种，其中17种主要农副产品每年能够供应160多亿斤，足可养猪800万头。旅大市发动群众利用粗料养猪，自1952年到1954年，猪数增加了二点六倍多。这些事实还不是最有力地说明了饲料问题是不难解决的吗？
    为了扩大饲料来源，农业合作社应该建立饲料基地，利用隙地和休闲地种植高产饲料作物、瓜类和绿肥作物。这些作物产量大，营养多，猪又爱吃。江苏省江宁县去年发动群众利用隙地栽种南瓜，平均每户种夏南瓜30多株，共计收获8，600多万斤，足够作为6万多头猪的基础饲料。绿肥作物的主要作用是肥田，据浙江省农民的经验，在每亩田里割500斤绿肥喂猪，对农作物产量并不发生影响，对解决猪的饲料问题却有很大的帮助。
    但是养猪又必需一定数量的精料。只用粗料喂猪，生猪不容易达到应有的肥度，还会延长饲养的时间，浪费大量的粗料。在去年的粮食统购工作中，各省人民委员会已经根据当地的实际情况，订出适当的留粮标准，给今年发展养猪业创造了很好的条件。重点产猪省区，还应该在本省粮食供应指标以内，调拨一部分杂粮，供应养猪数量多、出口任务大、饲料比较缺乏的地区的需要。各种油饼应该尽量用作猪的饲料，再用猪粪肥田。各省的农业、粮食、供销合作等部门应该共同商定把油饼拨作饲料的适当比例，及早供应到养猪户手里。糠麸是生猪的主要精料，各地粮食部门和供销合作部门更要做好供应工作。
    有些人认为目前猪疫还相当多，所以难于大量养猪。这种想法也是不对的。有些地区猪疫猖獗，主要原因并不是猪疫无法防治，而是防疫工作做的不好。防治猪疫的基本办法是在平时做好饲养管理和家畜卫生工作，适时地进行预防注射，以减少发病的可能性。在发生疫病以后，要及时实行隔离、封锁、消毒、合理处理尸体等措施，以防止疫病的蔓延。
    为了做好防疫工作，必须把民间兽医组织起来，很好地团结和使用他们，同时还应该有计划地为农业合作社训练防疫人员，传授家畜卫生防疫知识和注射各种疫苗的技术，这是农村中防治兽疫的基本力量，必须及早培养。
    有些人认为农业合作社缺乏养猪经验，不宜即刻发展公有猪。这是一种旧看法。目前一般合作社确实缺乏大量喂养公有猪的经验，但是，如果不积极地喂养公有猪，经验从何处得来呢？现在参加半社会主义的农业合作社的农户已占总农户的70％以上，所谓发展养猪业，主要是在农业合作社中提倡喂养公有猪，要不然，生猪生产任务就有落空的危险。因此，各地应该积极领导合作社由少到多地发展公有猪，切不可以放任自流。
    在发展农业合作社的公有猪的同时，还要努力组织社员养私有猪。绝对不能忽视农民在这方面的积极性。河北省定县韩家洼农业合作社养了种猪，大量繁殖小猪，除留一部分由社公养以外，大部分卖给社员私养，小猪的价钱还比市价低5％，社员资金有困难的，可在卖掉肥猪以后归还。合作社的种猪为社员的母猪配种，一律免收配种费。由于实行了这些措施，到1955年末，全社公有猪和私有猪共达1，600多头，平均每户有一头半。当年每亩地平均施粗肥12，000斤，全社92％的土地可以一年两熟，平均每亩收获512斤，比1952年刚成立合作社的时候增产32.6％。
    有人担心农业合作社大量喂养公有猪，更容易发生和传播猪疫病。其实，情形恰恰相反。农业合作社易于接受先进的科学技术，能够集中必要的资金，比个体农民更能预防和扑灭猪疫病。像上边说的定县韩家洼农业合作社，已经培养了3名牲畜保健员，定期到社员家中检查猪圈卫生，按时进行预防注射，在1955年一年中没有发生过任何猪病。
    有些人认为养猪是农民几千年来的老习惯，我们不去领导，他们也会饲养。这种想法是错误的。农民的养猪积极性常常要受各种条件的影响。有些农民因为仔猪不容易买到，饲料不够，就不想多养猪。有些农民对于收购生猪的工作有些意见，也不想积极养猪。有些农民认为参加农业合作社以后，肥料由合作社统一解决，自己可以不必养猪。有些社员感觉合作社收购猪粪的价格不公道，养猪劲头就不大。这些问题充分说明，只有加强领导，帮助农民解除各种思想顾虑，解决各种实际困难，养猪业才能迅速地大规模地发展，放任自流是不行的。浙江省专门设立了生猪产销工作委员会办公室，加强了这方面的领导，1955年年终猪数发展到310万头，比当年6月末增加21％，这就是一个明显的例子。
    去年年底全国农业工作会议决定提前超额完成第一个五年计划的生猪增殖任务。这就是说，在1956年一年中，不但要恢复了1955年减产的数字，并且要提前一年达到第一个五年计划增殖13，834万头的指标，这个任务是艰巨的。可是，依靠广大农民高度的社会主义积极性，加上农民手中存粮已有增加，只要加强领导，这个任务是可以完成的。我们必须进行艰苦的工作，努力争取完成和超额完成这个任务。
