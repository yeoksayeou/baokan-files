    Rural Areas Across the Country Greatly Exceed Original Plan for Winter Manure Accumulation

    The accumulation of manure in rural areas across the country this winter has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Anhui, Hubei, Guangdong, and Hebei alone, these four provinces have accumulated 3,286 million dan (each dan being 100 jin) of various fertilizers from last winter to now, greatly exceeding the original plan. In Jilin and Gansu provinces, the amount of manure accumulated has reached 50% to 60% of the annual need. The fertilizer reserves in Hunan and Sichuan provinces have increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year, calculated based on the average application rate. In Zhejiang Province, the amount of manure accumulated in each county and district has generally more than doubled compared to last year. The amount of manure accumulated in Shanxi, Fujian, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces has also greatly exceeded previous years.
    The manure accumulation activities in various regions were launched after the great development of the agricultural cooperativization movement. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. In addition to participating in manure accumulation activities, farmers in many provinces and districts have also established specialized manure accumulation organizations. For example, more than 130 counties in Sichuan Province organized 32,000 manure accumulation shock brigades, with each person accumulating at least 700 jin and up to 5,000 jin. The "Everyone Accumulates 1,000 Jin of Manure Movement" in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has also generally exceeded its targets. Currently, all provinces and regions are continuing to accumulate manure in preparation for spring plowing.

    各地农村冬季积肥大大超过原定计划
    全国各地冬季积肥获得很大成绩。仅据安徽、湖北、广东、河北4省的不完全统计，这4个省从去年冬季到现在就积了各种肥料328，600万担（每担100斤），大大超过了原定计划。吉林、甘肃两省的积肥量已经达到全年需要量的50％到60％以上。湖南、四川两省现在积储的肥料，按平均施肥量计算，都比去年增加一成到二成。浙江省各县、区的积肥量一般都比去年增加一倍以上。山西、福建、云南、贵州等省的积肥量也都大大超过往年。
    各地的积肥活动是在农业合作化运动大发展以后开展起来的。因此，群众的情绪都很高涨。许多省、区的农民除了普遍参加积肥活动以外，还成立了专门的积肥组织。如四川省有130多个县组织了32，000个积肥突击队，每人积肥少的700斤，多的达到5，000斤。新疆维吾尔自治区的“人人千斤积肥运动”也都普遍超额完成。现在，各省区正在继续积肥，迎接春耕生产。　（新华社）
