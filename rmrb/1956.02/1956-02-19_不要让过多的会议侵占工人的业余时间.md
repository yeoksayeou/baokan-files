    Don't let excessive meetings encroach on workers' spare time
    To the Editor:
    The workers of the Beijing No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory feel a headache whenever meetings are mentioned, because there are just too many meetings in this factory. The most meetings are held in the machining workshop. The workers in this workshop have to attend 4 to 5 production meetings of the work section, 1 workshop employee meeting, 3 factory-wide employee meetings, and 3 trade union group meetings every month; Party and League members also have to attend 4 Party and League activity days every month; those who hold positions in the Party, League, and trade union organizations also have to attend all sorts of small meetings.
    Are all these meetings absolutely necessary? Not at all. For example, before the workshop employee meeting, the workshop director has to report the report to be made at the meeting to the Party meeting first, and sometimes he has to report it to the League members first. Thus, the workshop director has to report the same content 3 times, and the Party and League members also have to listen twice. In addition, the 4 production meetings held by each work section every month to discuss and solve key problems are not very effective and of low quality, and do not solve any problems. Therefore, the workers reflect: "It's not holding meetings, but wasting time."
    With so many meetings, of course, a lot of the workers' spare time is taken up; especially for workers who work both early and late shifts, the time spent in the factory every day is very long. For example, an ordinary early shift worker enters the factory at 3:30 in the morning, and after getting off work at 12:00 noon, he has to stay in the factory for meetings or study according to the uniformly stipulated activity time (4:40 pm to 7:10 pm). There are more than 4 hours of gap between getting off work and the meeting. If you go home, you will be too tired, and it is difficult to use these time; if your home is far from the factory, you have to stay in the factory for 16 hours a day. Comrade Zhang Jinghan in this workshop is a League member and also serves as the head of the trade union group. He spends all his time in the factory except for sleeping five or six hours a day at home.
    Although there are fewer small meetings in other workshops, the situation of many meetings is equally serious. This situation seriously damages the workers' health and also affects the workers' spare time study. According to the statistics of the factory's clinic, workers suffering from stomach diseases account for 40% of the factory's morbidity rate. According to the chief physician, the reason for getting stomach diseases is mainly that there are too many meetings and the time is too long, the workers' diet is abnormal and the rest time is insufficient. There are 4 workers in this factory who are model workers in Beijing, but now two of them have lung disease due to overwork and have stopped working to rest; and one has stomach disease.
    The administrative and Party, League, and trade union organizations of the No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory should take practical and effective measures to change this situation of "many meetings and long meetings."

### 不要让过多的会议侵占工人的业余时间

    不要让过多的会议侵占工人的业余时间编辑同志：
    北京市第一汽车附件厂的职工，一提起开会就感到头痛。因为这个厂的会议实在太多了。开会最多的是机钳加工车间。这个车间的职工每月要参加4次到5次的工段生产会议，1次车间职工大会，3次全厂职工大会和3次工会小组会；党、团员每月还要过4次党、团活动日；在党、团、工会组织担任职务的人还要开各式各样的小会。
    是不是这些会都非开不可呢？完全不是。如车间职工大会在开会之前，车间主任要把在大会上所做的报告先在党的会议上报告一次，有时还得先给团员报告一次，于是，同样内容的报告，车间主任要报告3次，党、团员也要听两次。还有每月各工段召开的4次讨论解决关键问题的生产会议，有的效果不大，质量不高，并不解决什么问题。因此工人反映：“不是开会，而是耗时间。”
    会开得这样多，当然要占去工人很多业余时间；特别是做早晚两班活的工人，每天在厂里的时间很长。如一个普通的早班工人从早上3点30分进厂，到中午12点下班后还要根据统一规定的活动时间（下午4点40分到7点10分）在厂里开会或学习。从下班到开会有4个多小时的空隙，如果回家就疲于奔命，也难于利用这些时间；如果家里离厂较远，那就只好一天在厂里呆上16个小时。这个车间的张景汉同志，是团员，又担任了工会小组长的工作，他每天除了回家睡五、六个小时的觉以外，其他时间都在工厂里。
    其他车间的小会虽然少一点，但是会议多的情况同样是严重的。这种情况，严重地损害了工人的健康，也影响了工人的业余学习。根据厂里医务所的统计，厂里患胃病的工人占全厂发病率的40％。得胃病的原因，据主任医师谈，主要是开会过多而时间过长，工人的饮食不正常和休息时间不足。这个厂有4个职工是北京市劳动模范，现在有两个因为劳累过度，得了肺病，已经停止工作在休息；还有一个得了胃病。
    第一汽车附件厂的行政和党、团、工会组织应该采取切实有效的办法，改变这种“会议多、会议长”的情况。
