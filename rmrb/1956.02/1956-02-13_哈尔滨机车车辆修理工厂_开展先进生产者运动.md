    Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory
    Launches Advanced Producer Movement
    The Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory is launching an advanced producer movement. This was initiated by 422 advanced workers at the factory's Second Advanced Producers and Rationalization Proposal Representatives Conference, and has been unanimously supported by all workers in the factory.
    The advanced producer movement in this factory first aims to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. During the movement, the goal is to increase the value of this year's production by 20% compared to last year, increase labor productivity by 20% compared to last year, reduce costs by 8% compared to last year, completely eliminate returned repairs in terms of quality, and ensure that castings and forgings meet quality standards. The movement requires the promotion of the Kolesov lathe method on 20% of the machine tools, the promotion of Zhuang Minggeng's advanced experience in more than 50% of the teams, and the promotion of the Zhendarova work method in 100 teams. The movement also requires giving full play to the role of technical personnel and implementing the policy of combining labor and technology.
    The advanced producer movement in this factory will be guided by the principle of advanced workers leading the backward. Advanced workers are required to provide brotherly assistance to the backward, driving them forward to achieve universal improvement, ensuring that the ranks of advanced workers expand to about 30% of all employees this year, and that advanced groups also account for about 30% of all groups in the factory.

    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂
    开展先进生产者运动
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂正在开展先进生产者运动。这是在这个工厂第二届先进生产者及合理化建议者代表大会上，由422名先进工作者倡议，得到全厂职工一致拥护而开展的。
    这个厂的先进生产者运动首先以争取4年完成5年计划为奋斗目标。在运动中，要做到今年的产值比去年增长20％，劳动生产率比去年增长20％，成本要比去年实际降低8％，质量上要彻底消灭返厂修理，铸锻件要达到质量标准。在运动中要求在20％的机床上推行科列索夫车刀法，有50％以上的小组推行庄铭耕先进经验，有100个小组推行震达罗娃工作法。在运动中还要充分发挥技术人员的作用，实现劳动和技术相结合的方针。
    这个厂的先进生产者运动将以先进带动落后为指导原则。要求先进者对落后者给以兄弟般的帮助，带动落后前进，达到普遍提高，保证今年内先进者队伍扩大到占全体职工30％左右，并且使先进小组也达到占全厂小组的30％左右。　（新华社）
