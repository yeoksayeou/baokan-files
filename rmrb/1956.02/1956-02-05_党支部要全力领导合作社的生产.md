    The Party Branch Must Fully Lead the Production of the Cooperative
    By our reporter Ji Xichen
    The season has not yet crossed out of winter, but the fields of Garden Township are already full of the scenery of spring. This year, the members have started sending manure, plowing and harrowing the fields earlier than any year before. While they are planting tobacco, hemp, and potatoes in the soft soil, they are also applying additional fertilizer to the spring wheat and rapeseed fields. The dense spring crops are growing like a green carpet. Under the leadership of the Party Branch, all agricultural cooperatives have enthusiastically thrown themselves into production.
    How does the Garden Township Party Branch lead production? Like other places on the Sichuan West Plain, the Pixian Garden Township Party Branch immediately faced a new situation after the collectivization of the entire township: although all 22 new cooperatives had been established, because the spring wheat, rapeseed, and turnip seeds had not been incorporated into the cooperatives, the members were still working on their own. Many poor peasants were dissatisfied and said, "A high tide for three days, half a year of cold idleness." According to the past habits of newly established cooperatives, the spring crops were all harvested separately. Experience has proven that this would affect the production of the cooperative. For example, last year, 5 old cooperatives in the township were affected because spring crops were not incorporated in the first year, and the harvesting times of wheat, hemp, and tobacco were different, which resulted in the late planting of rice by more than ten days. The branch studied these situations and immediately decided to change this old habit and persuaded everyone to bring more than 20,000 mu of spring crops into the cooperative half a year earlier. Because meticulous ideological education work was done and the issues of labor, cattle labor, seeds, and fertilizer in the incorporation of spring crops were reasonably handled, the problem of incorporating spring crops was successfully resolved, and the members were very satisfied.
    Although the incorporation of spring crops created favorable conditions for consolidating the new cooperatives, a common phenomenon occurred in each cooperative: sometimes there were not enough people for certain tasks, and sometimes there were too many people like a swarm of bees. Therefore, reasonably organizing labor became a problem that needed to be solved immediately. In addition to assisting the new cooperatives in quickly completing the compilation of production teams and the division of farming areas, and overcoming the chaotic state of production, the Party Branch also, based on the experience that small-scale contracting could increase labor efficiency by 20% and large-scale contracting could increase labor efficiency by another 20% compared to small-scale contracting, immediately began to promote contracting for work and output in the new cooperatives. On the one hand, the branch widely promoted the superiority of contracting for work and output among the members; on the other hand, it summarized the experience of old cooperatives in contracting for work and output, discussed and determined the various control indicators for production, investment, and labor quotas in the new cooperatives, and at the same time, formulated simple and easy-to-use labor quota manuals and some necessary forms for contracting for work and output, and distributed them to the new cooperatives, allowing the new cooperatives to discuss, revise, and supplement them in light of specific circumstances. This enabled the new cooperatives to have something to follow when formulating various relevant quota indicators, greatly saving the time for promoting contracting for work and output. In order to quickly complete the labor allocation work of the production teams, the Party Branch also widely promoted the method of self-reporting and public discussion, so that the production and labor plans of each cooperative and team were closely integrated with the daily production activities of the members in a short period of time. In the self-reporting and public discussion, everyone, based on the specific circumstances such as the strength of the members' labor force and their production expertise, and according to the principles of subordinating to production needs and voluntary mutual benefit, specifically arranged the types of work, the number of workdays, and the time of work that each member should perform in each production season throughout the year. This enabled the members to plan and coordinate various production activities of the cooperative and the members' families. This was not only conducive to the collective production of the cooperative, but also conducive to the development of the members' household sideline occupations, overcoming the shortcomings that the members' work plans often contradicted and were disconnected from the cooperative's labor allocation plans in the past.
    Because the Party Branch dared to boldly break with convention and also did meticulous ideological education and organizational work, it took only a little more than half a month to fully promote contracting for work and output in 121 production teams. This shattered the conservative view that "new cooperatives cannot implement large-scale contracting in the first year."
    The implementation of contracting for work and output greatly increased the enthusiasm of the masses for production. People swept road ash, shoveled turf, and dug ditch mud before dawn to make mixed fertilizer, and searched for superior varieties everywhere hundreds of miles away. In order to push the production enthusiasm of the masses to a new high, the Party Branch also, in conjunction with criticizing conservative thinking, formulated an annual plan for increasing agricultural and sideline production and measures for increasing production. When formulating the plan for increasing production, the Party Branch mobilized the members of the cooperative's management committee, production team leaders, and experienced farmers to form a special group to go deep into the fields, conduct cultivation appraisals of the land plot by plot, and determine what crops should be planted on each plot of land, what seeds should be planted, and how much fertilizer should be applied according to the different soil quality and cultivation conditions of each plot of land. Then, measures and targets for increasing production were formulated according to local conditions. This method of in-depth field investigation and research not only facilitated the on-the-spot summarization of various high-yield experiences, the analysis of the reasons for low yields, and the avoidance of repeating the shortcomings of individual management in the past, but also enabled the rapid formulation of advanced and reliable plans for increasing production. In the past, some cooperatives often failed to formulate production plans for more than half a month, but now they can formulate them in just four or five days. Originally, the production increase targets for rice, rapeseed, hemp, tobacco, and other grain crops in each cooperative were generally too conservative. After on-site appraisal, each cooperative re-revised the plan, and the production increase targets were generally increased from 10% to more than 35%.
    Because the branch conducted thorough investigation and research, conscientiously summarized the experience in increasing production, and also determined two methods of production innovation, one innovation method was to promote Gao Shuchang's "planting pot-ba seedlings" advanced rice planting method in the entire township. This rice planting method can increase the yield by more than 150 jin of grain per mu. The other innovation method was to make full use of the soil fertility and change the old-fashioned farming habits. In addition to widely promoting the planting of double-cropping rice, the township also converted some of the low-yielding rice fields into land that can grow five seasons of high-yielding crops such as corn, potatoes, autumn sweet potatoes, and broad beans in a year, so that the per-mu yield per unit area was increased from 300 jin to more than 1,200 jin.
    The Party Branch also paid close attention to the preparatory work for spring plowing and production. By the end of January, except for some late rice and potato seeds, the township had basically completed the preparation of various production materials such as improved varieties, fertilizers, plowing cattle, and new-style farm tools needed for the annual production. Each cooperative had bought back more than 20 plowing cattle, more than 1,000 pigs, and accumulated 13 million jin of various manure fertilizers. In order to ensure that livestock had sufficient feed, each cooperative established feed bases and increased the planting of thirty to forty mu of sweet potatoes, turnip seeds, and broad beans.
    In order to ensure the success of developing production and consolidating new cooperatives, the branch adopted a leadership method that combined long-term planning with short-term arrangements. That is, first, make a comprehensive plan for two months of work, so that the branch can carry out its work in a planned and foresighted manner. At the same time, in order to ensure that this plan can be gradually implemented, the branch holds a joint meeting of cadres above the level of cooperative director or team leader every two or three days, and each time only arranges to check one or two tasks. Because the tasks are clear, the focus is prominent, the instructions are specific, and the time is not long, it is not only easy for the cadres to remember and implement, but also can discover and solve problems in a timely manner. This is of great benefit to the realization of the Party's specific and timely guidance.

    党支部要全力领导合作社的生产
    本报记者　纪希晨
    季节还没有跨出冬天，可是花园乡的田野里已充满着春天的景色。今年，社员们比那一年都更早的开始了送粪、犁地和耙田，他们一面在松软的土地里栽播烟、麻和马铃薯，一面在春麦、油菜田里增施追肥，茂密的小春作物生长的像绿色的地毯。在党支部领导下，所有农业合作社都火热的投入了生产。
    花园乡党支部是怎样领导生产的呢？像川西平原其他地方一样，郫县花园乡党支部在全乡合作化以后，马上就面临着一个新情况：全乡22个新社虽然都建立了，但由于麦子、油菜、苕籽等小春青苗没有入社，社员们还是各干各的活路。许多贫农都不满地说：“高潮三天，冷闲半年”。而按照过去新建社的习惯，小春作物都是各归各收，经验证明，这会影响社里的生产。例如去年全乡有5个老社就因为头一年小春作物没有入社，麦、麻、烟的收获时间不一，使得水稻晚播了十多天。支部研究了这些情况，即决定改变这种老习惯，说服大家把两万多亩小春作物一律提早半年入社。由于作了细致的思想教育工作，又合理地处理了小春作物入社中的人工、牛工、种籽和肥料等问题，小春作物入社问题顺利解决了，社员们都很满意。
    小春作物入社虽然给巩固新社创造了有利条件，可是各社又普遍发生了有的活路调不到人，有的活路人多的像一窝蜂的现象。于是，合理地组织劳力又成了一个需要马上解决的问题。党支部除了协助各新建社很快完成了编生产队划耕作区，克服生产上的混乱状态而外，又根据小包工可以提高劳动效率20％，大包工又可比小包工提高劳动效率20％的经验，立即着手在新社中推行包工包产。支部一方面在社员中广泛展开包工包产优越性的宣传；另一方面就总结了老社包工包产的经验，讨论确定了新社生产、投资、劳动定额等各项控制指标，同时统一制定了简单易行的劳动定额手册和包工包产的一些必要表格，发给各个新社，让各个新社结合具体情况加以讨论修正和补充。这样使新社在制定各项有关定额指标的时候有所遵循，大大节省了推行包工包产的时间。为迅速做好生产队的劳动调配工作，党支部还广泛推行了自报公议的方法，使各个社、队的生产劳动计划，在短时期内和社员个人的日常生产活动紧密结合起来。在自报公议中，大家根据社员劳动力的强弱和生产特长等具体情况，根据服从生产需要和自愿互利政策的原则，具体安排出每个社员在全年各个生产季节应作的工种、应出的工数及出工的时间，这样就使社员能够有计划的统筹安排合作社的和社员家庭的各种生产。这样做既有利于社的集体生产，也有利于社员家庭副业的发展，克服了过去社员出工计划同社的劳动调配计划经常矛盾和互相脱节的缺点。
    由于党支部既敢于大胆地打破常规，又作了细致的思想教育工作和组织工作。因此，仅仅用了半个多月的时间，便在121个生产队中全面推广了包工包产。这就用事实打破了所谓“新社头一年不能实行大包工”的保守观点。
    包工包产的实行，大大提高了群众生产的积极性，人们天不亮就扫路灰、铲草皮、挖沟泥，制造混合肥料，到百里以外四处寻找优良品种。为把群众生产热情推向新的高潮，党支部还结合批判保守思想，制定了全年农副业增产计划和增产措施。制定增产计划时，党支部发动各个社的社务委员、生产队长和有经验的农民，组成专门小组，分别深入田间，逐块逐段的对土地进行耕作鉴定，按照每块土地的不同土质，耕作情况，具体确定每块土地应种什么作物，下什么种籽，施多少肥料，然后，因地制宜的制定出每块地的增产措施和增产指标。这种深入田间的调查研究方法，不仅便于就地总结各种高产经验，分析低产原因，避免重复往年个体经营时的缺点，而且能够迅速的制定出先进的可靠的增产计划。过去有些社往往半个多月都制定不出生产计划，现在只要四、五天就订出来了。原来各社的水稻、菜籽、麻、烟和其他粮食作物的增产指标普遍偏于保守，经过实地鉴定以后，各社都重新修订了计划，增产指标普遍由10％增加到35％以上。
    由于支部切实地作了调查研究，认真地总结了增产经验，还确定了两项生产革新的办法，一项革新办法是在全乡推广七村高树昌的“栽锅巴秧”的先进栽秧法，这种栽秧法，可使每亩多收150多斤谷子。另一项革新办法是充分利用地力，改变老一套的耕作习惯，全乡除普遍推广增种双季稻外，还把一部分种水稻的低产田，改为一年可种玉蜀黍、马铃薯、秋红苕、葫豆等五季高产作物的土地，使单位面积的亩产由300斤增加到1，200多斤。
    党支部也十分注意春耕生产的准备工作。一月底，除部分晚稻、马铃薯种籽外，全乡已经基本完成了全年生产所需的良种、肥料、耕牛、新式农具等各种生产资料的准备工作。各社已买回耕牛20多条，毛猪1，000多条，积各种粪肥1，300万斤。为保证家畜有充足的饲料，各个社都建立了饲料基地，增种了三、四十亩红薯、苕籽和葫豆。
    为了保证作好发展生产巩固新社的工作，支部采用了长计划结合短安排的领导方法。这就是首先作出两个月工作的全面安排的规划，使支部能够有计划有预见地进行工作。同时，为了使得这一计划能够逐步贯彻执行，每隔两三天支部就召开一次社长或队长以上干部的联席会议，每次只布置检查一两件工作。由于任务明确，中心突出，交代具体，时间不长，不但便于干部记忆和执行，而且能够及时发现和解决问题。这对实现党的具体及时的指导有很大好处。
