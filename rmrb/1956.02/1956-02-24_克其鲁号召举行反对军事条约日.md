Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 22nd - Saifuddin Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, issued a statement on February 22nd, calling for March 4th to be designated as "Anti-Military Treaty Day." In his statement, he said that the purpose of the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty is "to undermine the unity of the Asian people, to make 'Asians fight Asians,' and therefore to keep Asia under the political, economic, and military control of foreign imperialism."

    Kitchlew referred to the military exercises held by the Manila Treaty Organization and the Manila Treaty Organization Council meeting to be held soon in Karachi. He said: "There is no doubt that the military and economic pressure being exerted on those Asian countries that still refuse to support the military policies of Western countries is rapidly increasing."

    Kitchlew said: "Eliminating the growing threat of armies and armaments and foreign military bases around our borders is urgent. Because today, we must use all our resources, all our manpower, in the great cause we have undertaken—to rid ourselves of the terrible vestiges of colonial rule and build a prosperous and peaceful India."

    克其鲁号召举行反对军事条约日
    新华社新德里22日电　全印和平理事会主席赛福丁·克其鲁在2月22日发表声明，号召把3月4日作为反对军事条约日。他在声明中说：巴格达条约和东南亚条约的“目的在于破坏亚洲人民的团结，使‘亚洲人打亚洲人’，因此，也就是使亚洲继续处在外国帝国主义的政治、经济和军事控制之下”。
    克其鲁谈到马尼拉条约组织举行的军事演习以及即将在喀喇蚩举行的马尼拉条约组织理事会会议。他说：“毫无疑问，对于那些仍然拒绝支持西方国家军事政策的亚洲国家施加的军事和经济压力正在迅速加重。”
    克其鲁说：“消除日益增加的军队和军备的威胁和我们边境周围的外国军事基地是迫不及待的。因为在今天，我们必须把我们所有的资源，所有我们人力用在我们已经进行的伟大的事业方面——使得我们自己消除殖民统治的可怕遗迹，建立繁荣和和平的印度。”
