	Celebrating the Great Achievements of the CPSU Congress
	"Under the Banner of Leninism"
	The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 27th entitled "Under the Banner of Leninism," summarizing the achievements of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The editorial stated that the proceedings of the Congress and the resolutions it adopted are of great historical significance. These resolutions are a program for further action in building a communist society in the Soviet Union, strengthening world peace, and ensuring the victory of the great Marxist-Leninist ideas. The Congress demonstrated the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party, the close unity of its ranks around its long-tested collective leadership—the Leninist Central Committee—and its inseparable connection with the masses of the people. The proceedings of the Congress, the resolutions it adopted, and the warm congratulations from delegations of fraternal communist and workers' parties from all over the world, all reaffirmed Lenin's incisive words: our Party is the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our era.
	The editorial then analyzed the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the resolution adopted by the 20th Congress on this report. The editorial stated that the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union armed the Party and the Soviet people with a Marxist analysis of the current international situation and a correct understanding of the prospects for peaceful development. The consistent peace-loving foreign policy pursued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government was fully endorsed by the Congress. The conclusions drawn by the Central Committee's report on issues such as the peaceful coexistence of two systems, the possibility of avoiding war in the present era, and the forms of transition to socialism in different countries, are further creative developments of Marxist-Leninist theory based on new historical experiences. These conclusions were unanimously agreed upon and supported by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
	The Congress unanimously agreed with the measures proposed in the Central Committee's report to further improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. The Congress pointed out that the further strengthening of the Soviet social and political system, the consolidation of the alliance between the working class and the collective farmers, and the consolidation of the friendship and cooperation among all nationalities of the Soviet Union are important achievements of the Communist Party's work. The Congress emphasized that the foundation of the Central Committee's successful work is the creative application of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, strict adherence to the principles of Leninist collective leadership and inner-Party democracy, and the unwavering implementation of Lenin's instructions on maintaining an inseparable connection between our Party and the people. Over the years, the Party has held high the great banner of the immortal Lenin. The characteristic of all the work of the 20th Congress was unanimous support for the work of the Central Committee.
	"Pravda" concluded by saying that the resolutions of the Congress have unfolded bright prospects for all the Soviet people and have given them unshakable confidence in the victory of the great cause to which our glorious Party, founded by the immortal Lenin, has dedicated its entire life and energy—the cause of communism.
	The Grand Program of the CPSU
	The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on February 27th, stating: The reports of Khrushchev and Bulganin heard and discussed at this Congress, as well as the relevant decisions of the Congress, mark the world-historic victory of the ever-victorious Marxist-Leninist doctrine. The historic documents of the Congress are the grand program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, filled with victorious confidence in the great goal of the Soviet people—the cause of communism.
	The editorial stated that the valuable and rich experience accumulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is infinitely valuable to the Workers' Party of Korea, just as it is to the fraternal parties of all countries. We must creatively apply this experience in our own work and life to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the construction of the socialist foundation in the northern half, and further contribute to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
	Historically Significant Resolutions
	The Czechoslovak "Rude Pravo" published an editorial on the 26th, stating that the historically significant 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the resolutions it adopted are of great theoretical and practical significance for the correct policy in the future development stage of communism. The editorial continued: The 20th Congress has become a victory for Leninism. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and other revolutionary political parties, learning from the example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, will constantly defend the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory and summarize new experiences, thereby developing this theory in their own practical struggles.

    庆祝苏共代表大会的伟大成就
    “在列宁主义的旗帜下”
    “真理报”在27日以“在列宁主义的旗帜下”为题发表社论，总结苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的成就。社论说，代表大会的进程和它所作出的决议具有巨大的历史重要性。这些决议是为在苏联建设共产主义社会、为加强世界和平和保证伟大的马克思列宁主义思想的胜利而进一步行动的纲领。代表大会显示了共产党的牢不可破的团结，显示了它的队伍紧密团结在它的久经考验的集体领导——列宁主义的中央委员会的周围，显示了它和人民群众的不可分割的联系。大会的进程、它所通过的决议以及来自世界各地的兄弟共产党和工人党代表团对它的热烈贺词，都再度证实了列宁的一针见血的话：我们的党是我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。
    社论接着分析了苏联共产党中央委员会的报告和第二十次代表大会对这一报告所通过的决议。社论说，苏联共产党中央委员会的报告用对目前国际局势的马克思主义的分析、对和平发展前景的正确了解，武装了党和苏联人民。苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府一贯奉行的爱好和平的外交政策，获得了代表大会的完全赞同。党中央委员会的报告对于两个制度的和平共处、现时代避免战争的可能性和不同国家过渡到社会主义的形式等问题所得出的结论，是在新的历史经验基础上对马克思列宁主义的理论的进一步创造性的发展。这些结论都得到了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的一致同意和支持。
    代表大会一致同意中央委员会报告中所提出的进一步提高人民的物质和文化生活水平的措施。代表大会指出：苏联社会和政治制度的进一步加强、工人阶级和集体农民之间的联盟的巩固以及苏联各族人民的友谊和合作的巩固，是共产党的工作的重要成绩。大会强调指出，中央委员会的胜利工作的基础是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义学说、严格遵守列宁的集体领导和党内民主的原则，以及坚定不移地执行列宁提出的关于我们的党和人民保持不可分割的联系的指示。这些年来，党一直高举着不朽的列宁的伟大旗帜。第二十次代表大会的全部工作的特点是对中央委员会工作的一致拥护。
    “真理报”最后说，代表大会的决议为全体苏联人民展开了光辉的前景，并且使他们对于不朽的列宁缔造的我们光荣的党以它的全部生命和精力所致力的伟大事业——共产主义事业的胜利有了不可动摇的信心。
    苏共的宏伟的纲领
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”2月27日发表社论说：这次大会听取和讨论的赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁的报告以及大会上有关的决定，标志着百战百胜的马克思列宁主义学说的具有世界历史意义的胜利，大会的各项历史性的文件，是对苏联人民的伟大目标——共产主义事业充满着胜利信心的苏联共产党的宏伟的纲领。
    社论说，苏联共产党积累起来的宝贵的、丰富的经验，正如对于一切国家的兄弟党一样，对于朝鲜劳动党是无限宝贵的，我们要把这些经验创造性地运用在自己的工作和生活中，以促进祖国的和平统一和北半部社会主义基础的建设，并且进一步为亚洲和世界的和平事业作出贡献。
    具有历史意义的决议
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”在26日发表社论说，具有历史意义的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会和它所通过的决议，对于共产主义在今后的发展阶段中的正确政策来说，具有巨大的理论上和实际上的意义。社论接着写道：第二十次代表大会已经成为列宁主义的胜利。捷克斯洛伐克共产党和其他革命政党学习苏联共产党的榜样，将经常地保卫马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性，并且总结新的经验，从而在自己的实际斗争中发展这一理论。
