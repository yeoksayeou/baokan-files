    What is the Real Situation?
    Fang Qing
    During discussions about the 1956 production tasks at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, a dispute arose in the gauge workshop regarding the man-hours for grinding surface plates:

    The foreman said: "We should calculate our output based on the actual situation. Grinding one surface plate takes 4 hours, so it should be calculated as 4 hours."

    The Party Branch Secretary said: "Sometimes it can be ground in two hours, so we should calculate our future output based on two hours."

    The foreman said: "Looking at the past situation, most of the time it takes from 3 hours plus to 4 hours. This is the actual situation."

    The Party Branch Secretary said: "Our work is constantly advancing, and we should regard the most advanced practices as our most realistic actual situation."

    The foreman said: "It should be, but the workers' technical skills are not sufficient. According to the organizational design, a fifth-grade worker should do the grinding, but today we have third-grade and fourth-grade workers."

    The Party Branch Secretary said: "In a word, you have not factored in the elements of progress. You should boldly look forward and not cling to those outdated and obsolete things..."

    The Workshop Director said: "Let's discuss it with the workers."

    When discussing with the workers, they first investigated: who had ever ground one in two hours? How did they do it? The most important piece of advanced experience they found was to strive to shorten auxiliary man-hours, such as material requisition, tool preparation, loading, unloading… all these times were compressed to the minimum. In this way, one plate could be ground in two hours. Grinding worker Zhang Fengtai said: "If we start grinding with force from the beginning, we can grind one in one and a half hours. In the past, we never used to put much force at the beginning." Finally, the workers all agreed to calculate the time as one and a half hours. The foreman's thinking also became clear.

    Currently, many factory and mine leaders, like this foreman, have incorrect views on what constitutes the "real situation." They believe that since most people have not exceeded the current quota, then this quota is reasonable and cannot be changed. They always refuse to look at those who break the quota. Although those who break the quota are still a minority at present, they are advanced examples and a vigorously developing new force. Their today is the majority of workers' tomorrow. They should be seen as an indicator of progress, allowing the workers who are temporarily stopped at the current stage to learn from them. Countless facts have proven that the majority of workers will keep up with the minority of advanced individuals and move forward together. The Party Branch Secretary of the gauge workshop at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory is the person who leads the workshop staff to look forward. In fact, not only in the gauge workshop, but throughout the entire factory, two sentences are now universally popular: "Look forward, don't look backward!" "Complete the work of 1957 in 1956!" This is the real situation.

    什么是真实的情况
    方青
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂在讨论1956年生产任务的时候，量规车间为研磨平板的工时问题引起了争论：
    工长说：“应当根据实际情况计算我们的产量，磨一块平板的时间是4小时，就要按4小时计算。”
    支部书记说：“有时两小时也能磨出来，因此就应当按两小时计算我们未来的产量。”
    工长说：“按过去的情况看，绝大多数的时间是用3小时多到4小时，这是实际情况。”
    支部书记说：“我们的工作是不断前进的，应当把最先进的作法，看成我们最真实的实际情况。”
    工长说：“应当是应当，就是工人的技术条件不够；按组织设计是五级工研磨，我们今天是三级工、四级工。”
    支部书记说：“一句话：你没有把前进的因素估计在内，应当大胆地向前看，不应当留恋那些过了时的、陈旧的东西……”
    车间主任说：“咱们还是和工人商量商量吧。”
    和工人商量的时候，他们首先研究：谁曾经用两小时磨一块？他是怎么作的？结果找出了最主要的一条先进经验，就是努力缩短辅助工时，如领料、准备工具、上料、下料……都把时间压缩到最低限度。这样，两小时就能磨出一块来。研磨工张凤台说：“如果是一开始就用力磨，一点半钟就能磨出来；过去，乍一开始磨，总是不大用力。”最后，工人们都同意按一点半钟计算时间。工长的思想也通了。
    目前还有不少厂矿的领导人员跟这位工长一样，对什么是“真实的情况”有错误的看法。他们认为：既然多数人没有超过现在的定额，那么这个定额就是合理的，不能变动的。他们总是不肯去看那些突破定额的人。突破定额的人虽然在目前还是少数，但是他们是先进的榜样，是蓬蓬勃勃的新生力量。他们的今天，就是多数工人的明天，要把他们看成前进的指标，让暂时停止在现阶段的工人们向他看齐。无数的事实证明，多数工人是会跟上少数的先进人物一起前进的。哈尔滨量具刃具厂量规车间支部书记，就是领导车间职工向前看的人。事实上不仅是量规车间，全厂职工现在已普遍流行着这样两句话：“向前看，不要向后看！”“1956年要作完1957年的活！”这就是真实的情况。
