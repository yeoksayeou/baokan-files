Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steelmaking Plant Sets New Daily Output Record
Ironmaking Plant No. 6 Blast Furnace Workers Set New Utilization Coefficient Record for Large Blast Furnaces

The Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steelmaking Plant set a new daily output record since the plant's opening on the 17th. On this day, the steelworkers smelted 17.8% more steel for the country, producing more than 40 tons of steel compared to the previous highest record on December 15th of last year.

The steelworkers launched a rapid steelmaking competition. The steelworkers of No. 5 open-hearth furnace were the most energetic, producing three heats of rapid steel. In the morning, the steelworkers of Team C produced a heat of rapid steel in just 7 hours and 45 minutes. In the afternoon, the steelworkers of Team A smelted a heat of steel in 7 hours and 35 minutes, followed by Team B steelworkers who produced a heat of steel in just 7 hours and 25 minutes.

The workers of No. 6 blast furnace at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Ironmaking Plant set a new national utilization coefficient record for large blast furnaces on the 17th. The average effective volume of the blast furnace occupied per ton of pig iron smelted was reduced to 0.651 cubic meters. On this day, the workers of No. 6 blast furnace produced enough extra iron for the country to manufacture more than 1,000 double-wheeled, double-furrow plows. Currently, the Ironmaking Plant is summarizing the advanced experience of No. 6 blast furnace in learning from the Soviet Union's steam blowing and high-temperature operation methods, and preparing to promote it throughout the plant.

    鞍钢炼钢厂创造日产量最高纪录
    炼铁厂6号高炉工人创造大型高炉利用系数最新纪录
    鞍钢炼钢厂17日创造了开厂以来日产量的最高纪录。这一天，炼钢工人们为国家多冶炼了17.8％的钢，比去年12月15日的最高纪录还多生产了40多吨钢。
    炼钢工人们开展了快速炼钢竞赛。5号平炉的炼钢工人劲头最大，连出了3炉快速炼钢。早上丙班炼钢工人刚用7小时45分出了一炉快速炼钢，下午甲班炼钢工人就用7小时35分钟炼成了一炉钢，接着乙班炼钢工人又以7小时25分出了一炉钢。（新华社）
    鞍钢炼铁厂6号高炉的工人17日创造了全国大型高炉利用系数的最新纪录，平均每炼一吨生铁所占用的高炉有效容积已经降低到0.651立方公尺。这天6号高炉的工人为国家所多生产的铁，可以用来制造1，000多台双轮双铧犁。目前炼铁厂正在总结6号高炉学习苏联蒸汽鼓风、高温操作的先进经验，准备在全厂推广。
