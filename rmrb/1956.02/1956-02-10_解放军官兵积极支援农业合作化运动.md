Xinhua News Agency, 9th -- People's Liberation Army troops stationed throughout the country are vigorously supporting the agricultural cooperative movement and have already achieved great results.

Troops stationed in various locations have recently launched widespread donation campaigns to support agricultural production cooperatives. Statistics from just 6 units stationed in Beijing show that officers and soldiers have donated nearly 50,000 yuan. Huang Jie, a company commander from a certain unit of the Guangzhou garrison, donated all of his savings of 1,000 yuan to an agricultural cooperative with limited production funds. Officers and soldiers stationed in various locations used the donated money to purchase large quantities of new agricultural tools, livestock, fertilizer, books, etc., which were handed over to local governments or agricultural cooperatives.

Volunteer labor teams composed of officers and soldiers stationed in various locations are actively assisting local people in digging wells, building dams, reclaiming wasteland, accumulating fertilizer, and repairing roads. More than 1,500 young officers and soldiers from a certain unit of the Anhui Military Region assisted local people in building a major road in a very short period of time. Officers and soldiers stationed in Yingkou City helped reclamation farmers build a two-li long canal in one day. Troops stationed in the Kunming area have also established direct contact with 106 agricultural cooperatives in their garrisons, and they are prepared to provide manpower assistance to agricultural cooperatives regularly during the busy farming season and assist them in overcoming various production difficulties. Railway soldiers participating in the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway dispatched technicians to help agricultural cooperatives survey and build reservoirs and dikes, and dispatched bulldozers and other equipment to participate in the construction.

Troops in various locations are also actively assisting agricultural cooperatives in their garrisons in establishing clubs, libraries, and night schools; many troops have helped local agricultural cooperatives run training courses for accounting personnel. Officers and soldiers from a certain unit of the Shenyang garrison donated 2,100 books to help agricultural cooperatives establish libraries; they established 6 "Rural Friendship Bases" in rural areas near their garrisons to strengthen ties with agricultural cooperatives. Many troops sent performance teams and cultural work teams to the countryside to help agricultural cooperative members perform plays, teach songs, and run clubs. A certain unit stationed in Hefei has already helped 3 agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Hefei train 16 accountants and reprinted 300 literacy textbooks.

The Navy troops stationed in Beijing donated 34 telephones and 20,000 meters of telephone wire to help agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs establish a telephone network. Communications soldiers from the troops stationed in Tianjin also assisted agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs in establishing wired broadcasting networks and telephone networks.

    各地部队还积极协助驻地农业社建立俱乐部、图书馆、夜校；许多部队帮助当地农业社开办了会计人员训练班。驻沈阳部队某部官兵捐献了2，100册图书，帮助农业社建立图书馆；他们在驻地附近农村中建立了6处“农村友谊基地”，来密切和农业社的联系。许多部队派出战士演出队、文艺工作队下乡协助农业社社员演戏、教唱和开办俱乐部。驻合肥市某部已经帮助合肥市郊区3个农业社训练出16名会计员，翻印了300册识字课本。
