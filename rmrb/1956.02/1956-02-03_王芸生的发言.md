    Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I am an intellectual. After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and reading in detail his report on the issue of intellectuals at the CPC Central Committee meeting, I cannot remain unmoved. Therefore, I signed up to speak at this conference.

    Chairman Zhou said: "We hope that our intellectuals, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, can adopt the method of self-education, and gradually grow into intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve socialism through three interconnected paths: observing and practicing social life, engaging in professional practice, and studying Marxist-Leninist theory." I would like to talk about my experiences and determination in this regard.

    I am an intellectual who came from the old, semi-feudal, and semi-colonial China. The Party and the government have given me ample opportunities for work, study, and practical transformation. Please allow me to briefly recall: In the spring of 1949, I had just escaped from the Kuomintang's den and came from Hong Kong, which was under imperialist rule, to the newly liberated Beiping. Passing through the Shandong war zone, I saw the simple lives and diligent work of the CPC cadres amidst the war-torn society, and the harmonious relationship between the people and the government. I saw a new China growing vigorously, and I decided to follow the Chinese Communist Party. At that time, I pledged to "relearn everything and start from scratch." In the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I truly felt proud to be a Chinese; in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, I realized that China was definitely coming back to life; in the ideological remolding study in the autumn of 1952, I thoroughly examined and dug out the old roots of my thinking, and promised to "learn with humility to enrich myself and strive to arm my mind with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." Last June, I went to Helsinki to participate in the World Peace Congress and personally experienced the international weight of the new China, sharing the world's people's love for the new China. In early December last year, I went to the Tangshan area to inspect and saw the vast number of farmers taking the road of cooperation with vigorous and rapid strides. Men, women, old and young, were overjoyed and everyone pledged to "listen to Chairman Mao's words and engage in socialism." The root of China's poverty has been eradicated from here. In the high tide of agricultural cooperation, I saw the leap forward of our country's socialist revolution. During the inspection, when I went to Baoding to learn about the agricultural cooperation situation in Hebei Province from the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, according to statistics as of November 4, the number of farmer households joining agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 65.4% of the province's total farmer households. When the responsible comrades of the province reported to us, according to statistics as of November 10, only 6 days after the previous figure, the number of households joining the cooperatives rose to 66.78% of the province's total farmer households. In early December, when we arrived in Changli, we received a report that the number of households joining cooperatives had exceeded 70% of the province's total farmer households. When we returned to Beijing to sort out the inspection materials, as of the end of December, the number of farmer households joining agricultural production cooperatives reached 80% of the province's total farmer households. Now, as of January 25, the number of farmer households participating in advanced agricultural production cooperatives has accounted for 93% of the province's total farmer households. Hebei Province has victoriously realized the full socialist agricultural cooperation. Such a speed is faster than taking a train or a plane. Therefore, I cannot help but have deep feelings and reflect on myself. In these 7 years, what progress have I made? If there is any slight progress, I am afraid it is even slower than a snail climbing a wall!

    In the past 7 years, the Party and the government have trusted me, supported me, given me political status, arranged work for me, and helped me study. I have also repeatedly made promises to the people. However, after a slight examination of my work, study, and transformation, I am truly ashamed and have no place to hide my face. Few achievements, many mistakes, and even slower progress. How can this meet the country's requirements for me?

    In the high tide of the comprehensive upsurge of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country, the Party and the government have made solemn demands on intellectuals across the country. First, we are required to gradually grow into intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve socialism and to mobilize all the strength of intellectuals to catch up with the world's advanced scientific and cultural level in a short period of time.

    According to the analysis of the current political situation of intellectuals in Chairman Zhou Enlai's report, I am determined not to be "middle-of-the-roaders who are not active enough in politics." I am determined to strive to be a "progressive element who actively supports the Communist Party and the People's Government, actively supports socialism, and actively serves the people." I am determined to always follow the Communist Party, so I first approach the Communist Party ideologically and follow the Communist Party ideologically. I will work and study harder, continue to transform myself, and wholeheartedly serve socialism, so as not to fail the good fortune of catching up with the Mao Zedong era!

    王芸生的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我是一个知识分子，我听了周恩来主席的政治报告，又详细读过他在中共中央会议上所作的关于知识分子问题的报告，我不能无动于中，因此报名向大会发言。
    周主席说：“我们希望，我国知识分子能够在中国共产党的领导下，采取自我教育的方法，通过社会生活的观察和实践、业务的实践和马克思列宁主义理论的学习这样三个互相联系的途径，逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子。”我愿从这方面谈谈我的体会和决心。
    我是一个从半封建半殖民地的旧中国走过来的知识分子，党和政府给了我工作、学习和实践改造的充分机会。请容许我在这里作一个简单的回忆：在1949年春天，那时候，我刚从国民党的巢穴中逃出不久，从帝国主义统治下的香港到新解放的北平来，途经山东战区，在一片残破的战后社会中，看到中共干部这样朴素生活，认真工作，人民和政府这样水乳交融，就看到一个新生的中国正在茁长，我就决定跟着中国共产党走。当时我曾保证要“一切重新学，一切从头干。”在抗美援朝的胜利中，我真正感到作为一个中国人的骄傲；在“三反”“五反”运动中，我认识到中国是在肯定地起死回生；在1952年秋天的思想改造的学习中，我痛切检查了、挖了我的思想旧根子，保证“虚心学习，以充实我自己，努力以马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想武装我自己的头脑。”去年6月，到赫尔辛基参加世界和平大会，亲身体验到新中国的国际重量，自己分享到世界人民对新中国的爱慕。去年12月初，我到唐山地区视察，看到广大农民正以雄迈快速的步伐走合作化的大路。男女老少，欢天喜地，人人保证“听毛主席的话，搞社会主义。”中国的穷根子从这儿拔掉了。在农业合作化的高潮中，我看到我国社会主义革命的飞跃前进。在视察中，当我到保定向河北省人民委员会了解河北省农业合作化情况的时候，据截至11月4日的统计数字，全省加入农业生产合作社的农户占全省总农户的65.4％；省负责同志向我们汇报情况的时候，截至11月10日的统计，距离上一个数字仅仅6天的工夫，入社农户就上升到全省总农户的66.78％；12月初我们到昌黎，这时得到报告，入社农户已超过全省总农户的70％；等到我们回到北京整理视察材料的时候，截至12月底，加入农业生产合作社的农户达到了全省总农户的80％；现在，截至1月25日，河北省参加高级农业生产合作社的农户已占全省总农户的93％，河北省已胜利实现全社会主义的农业合作化。这样的速度真比坐火车坐飞机还快。因此，我不能不有深深的感触，反省一下我自己，在这7年中，究竟有些什么进步？假使还有些微的进步的话，恐怕比爬墙的蜗牛还要慢呵！
    7年来，党和政府信任我，支持我，给了我政治地位，给我安排了工作，帮助了我学习，我也一再向人民提过保证，但是稍微检查一下自己的工作、学习和改造的情况，真是惭愧得汗颜无地。成绩少，错误多，进步更是慢；这怎么可以适应国家对于我的要求呢？
    在我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造全面高涨的高潮中，党和政府向全国知识分子提出庄严的要求，首先要求我们逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子，要求动员知识分子的一切力量，在不长的时间内赶上世界的先进的科学文化水平。
    根据周恩来主席报告中关于知识分子的目前的政治情况的分析，我决不甘心作“在政治上不够积极的中间分子”，我决心争取作一个“积极拥护共产党和人民政府、积极拥护社会主义、积极为人民服务的进步分子”。我决心永远跟着共产党走，因此，我首先从思想上靠拢共产党，从思想上跟着共产党走。我要更加努力地工作和学习，继续自我改造，全心全意地为社会主义服务，以不辜负我赶上了毛泽东时代的这一幸运！
