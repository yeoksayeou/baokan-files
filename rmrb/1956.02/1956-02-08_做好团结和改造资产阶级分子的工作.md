    Do a Good Job of Uniting and Remolding Bourgeois Elements
    With the rapid development of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, former private industrialists and capitalists' agents in joint state-private enterprises have been or will be assigned to new jobs. In future work and study, continuing to remold their thinking and gradually transform them into working people who support themselves by their own labor is a task that Party organizations at all levels must take seriously.
    The rapid emergence of the high tide of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is the result of the education of capitalists over the past few years. However, the current high tide of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce is only the beginning of further in-depth transformation; much work must still be done on these enterprises and bourgeois elements in the future. After joint state-private ownership, due to the significant changes in the relations of production, the production, operation, and management of enterprises are directly led by the Party and the state, which creates favorable conditions for further transforming these enterprises and bourgeois elements. Judging from some existing experiences, as long as the Party organization correctly implements the policy of uniting and remolding bourgeois elements, not only can much resistance be reduced in the reform of the enterprise's production and management system, but also the determination of bourgeois elements to take the socialist road will be further strengthened. Some people who originally did not understand enterprise management have now learned management skills; some people who originally did not work are now participating in labor. After the joint state-private ownership of Shanghai Yifeng Enamel Factory, capitalist Dong Jixiong, due to his increased ideological awareness in learning, especially with the encouragement and help of the Party organization and employees, not only disclosed the formula but also improved it. Yu Shaozong, a private representative of Tianjin Hualong Cotton Textile Factory, with the support of the public representative and employees, improved the combined machine, shaking machine, and baling machine, greatly improving production efficiency.
    To ensure that the work of remolding bourgeois elements is truly effective, in addition to organizing them to participate in various political and current affairs studies, the following two principles must be earnestly implemented: First, boldly use them in work and care about their lives and treatment. Assign them appropriate work based on their specific conditions and truly ensure that they have duties and powers in their work. In their work, the Party organization should give them enthusiastic help and necessary encouragement; even a small improvement in their work should be promptly praised. Only in this way can they be transformed in practical work and their working ability gradually cultivated and improved; only in this way can they be encouraged and inspired to have the courage and confidence to accept transformation. Second, necessary criticism should be given to their shortcomings and mistakes in work and thought. The vast majority of bourgeois elements have performed well in joint state-private ownership, but their ideology and work style still need to be further transformed and improved. For example, in dealing with future enterprise management, some of them consciously or unconsciously propose and adopt some capitalist management methods. These management methods are contrary to socialist management methods. Some bourgeois elements, after hearing correct opinions, will correct their wrong views and ideas; some bourgeois elements will insist on their wrong views and ideas. This requires criticism and education. Only through criticism and education can bourgeois elements be further transformed.
    Many local Party organizations and Party member cadres are doing this correctly. The Party organization of Tianjin Lihe Fabrics Company has achieved considerable success in uniting and remolding bourgeois elements. After the joint state-private ownership of this enterprise, the Party branch first assisted the public representative in properly arranging the work of the private representatives according to their working abilities, especially based on the characteristic that most of the capitalist agents were technicians, relieving them of some administrative work they had undertaken before the joint ownership, so that they could concentrate on technical research and guidance. At the same time, the person in charge of the Party branch and the public representative also worked with them, consulted with them on matters, and gave them enthusiastic care and help in work and life. For example, when technician Liu Zhuoquan, a private representative, researched the use of naphthol dye to replace Shilin dye, the Party branch decided to strongly support him after learning about it. When he was afraid of failing in the research and wasting cotton yarn, and therefore behaved cautiously in the dyeing experiment, the Party branch suggested that the administration immediately send him some good cotton yarn for the experiment, and gradually added some instruments and equipment according to the needs of the experiment. When he succeeded in the experiment and used the substitute dye, some workers had antagonistic emotions, and the Party organization instructed the trade union to educate and persuade the workers, calling on the workers to learn from the private technicians and respect their technical guidance. Finally, with the assistance of all employees and technicians, the company successfully adopted the substitute dye, reducing the cost of dyeing materials for each piece of cotton yarn by about 80%, saving more than 10,000 yuan in 1955 alone. Liu Zhuoquan was therefore praised and rewarded, which further stimulated his enthusiasm for work. The engineer of this company, Zhao Cixue, a private representative, was old and ill. The Party organization suggested that the administration let him work in the morning and rest in the afternoon. The responsible cadres of the Party and the administration also visited him at his home. Zhao Cixue was deeply moved and worked more actively, giving lectures and writing lecture notes for interns despite his illness, and took the initiative to ask the leaders to transfer people to work with him, willing to teach them all the technical experience he had gained in Lihe Company for more than 30 years. The Party organization and administration of this company also did not neglect the ideological transformation of the private representatives. When some private representatives showed passivity because of mistakes in their work, the Party organization promptly criticized and educated them, making them realize their mistakes. In daily work, they consciously used some specific examples to educate them to gradually overcome the purely technical viewpoint of not believing in and not relying on the masses of workers, and taught them some socialist management methods.
    However, Party branches like Lihe Fabrics Company are not many in our Party. Some of our Party and state workers and staff members once lacked a correct understanding of the principles and policies for transforming capitalist industry and commerce and the changes in domestic class relations, and therefore were unwilling to carry out the work of uniting and remolding bourgeois elements; some people reluctantly accepted the tasks assigned by the Party, but because they were afraid of being corrupted by bourgeois ideology, they adopted an attitude of keeping a respectful distance from bourgeois elements; some only criticized capitalists in their work, without giving them necessary praise and encouragement. Recently, after extensive publicity and education inside and outside the Party, this seemingly "leftist" but essentially rightist ideological style has been greatly overcome, but the problem has not been completely solved. Today, there are still a few Party members, state organ cadres, and staff members who still have the ideological sentiments of being unwilling to work with bourgeois elements and fearing trouble. Therefore, Party organizations and trade unions must be good at using the many moving examples that have emerged in the current movement to further conduct publicity and education among Party member cadres and the masses of staff members, thoroughly criticize and correct various "leftist" and rightist ideological sentiments in the work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce; at the same time, they should also pay attention to summarizing and promoting successful experiences, so as to create a set of effective methods in the work of uniting and remolding bourgeois elements. This will ensure that this work of uniting and remolding bourgeois elements, which has world historical significance, will achieve greater victory.

### 做好团结和改造资产阶级分子的工作

    做好团结和改造资产阶级分子的工作
    随着资本主义工商业社会主义改造的迅速发展，各地实行公私合营的原私营企业的实职资本家和资本家代理人已经或者将要被安置在新的工作岗位上。在今后的工作和学习中继续改造他们的思想，逐步把他们改造成为自食其力的劳动人民，这是各级党的组织必须认真地做好的一件工作。
    资本主义工商业社会主义改造高潮的迅速出现，是几年来对资本家进行教育的结果。但是，目前私营工商业的社会主义改造高潮，还只是进一步深入改造的开始；今后对这些企业和资产阶级分子还必须做许多工作。公私合营以后，由于生产关系发生重要的变化，企业的生产经营管理工作已由党和国家直接领导，这就为进一步改造这些企业和资产阶级分子创造了有利的条件。从一些已有的经验来看，只要党组织正确地执行团结和改造资产阶级分子的政策，不但在企业的生产和经营管理制度的改革上可以减少许多阻力，而且将更加坚定资产阶级分子走社会主义道路的决心。有的人原来不懂企业经营管理工作的，现在学会了经营管理的技能；有的人原来不劳动的，现在参加了劳动。上海市公私合营益丰搪瓷厂的资本家董纪雄在企业公私合营以后，由于他在学习中提高了思想觉悟，特别是得到党组织和职工的鼓励和帮助，他不仅公开了配方，而且改进了配方。天津市公私合营华龙棉纺织厂的私方人员于绍宗，在公股代表和职工的支持之下，改进了合股机、摇挂机、打包机，大大地提高了生产效率。
    要使改造资产阶级分子的工作确实收到效果，除了应该组织他们参加各种政治和时事的学习以外，必须认真地贯彻执行以下两个原则：第一，要在工作中大胆地使用他们，关心他们的生活和待遇。根据他们的具体条件，分配他们适当的工作，并且真正做到在工作中有职有权。在工作中，党组织要给他们热诚的帮助和必要的鼓励；对他们工作中的进步，那怕是一点微小的进步，也要及时进行表扬。只有这样，才能在实际工作中改造他们，逐步培养和提高他们的工作能力；只有这样，才能鼓励和激发他们接受改造的勇气和信心。第二，对他们的工作和思想上的缺点和错误，要进行必要的批评。绝大部分资产阶级分子，在公私合营中的表现是好的，但是他们的思想意识和工作作风，还需要继续改造和提高。例如在对待今后的企业经营管理上，他们有的自觉或不自觉地提出和采用一些资本主义的经营管理方法。这些经营管理方法，和社会主义经营管理方法是相矛盾的。有的资产阶级分子听到正确意见以后，是会纠正自己的错误看法和想法的；也有的资产阶级分子会坚持自己的错误看法和想法。这就需要进行批评和教育。只有经过批评和教育，资产阶级分子才能得到进一步的改造。
    许多地方的党组织和党员干部是正确地这样做的。天津市利和织物公司的党组织，在团结和改造资产阶级分子的工作中取得了相当的成绩。在这个企业公私合营以后，党支部首先协助公方代表根据私方人员的工作能力，妥善地安排了他们的工作，特别是根据资方代理人多数是技术人员的特点，解除了他们在合营前就担负的一些事务性工作，使他们能够专心地从事技术研究和指导的工作。同时党支部的负责人和公方代表还同他们一起办公，遇事同他们协商，并且在工作和生活上给予他们热情的关怀和帮助。例如，技师、私方人员刘濯泉，研究用纳夫妥色代替士林色，党支部知道以后，就决定大力支持他。当他害怕研究不成反而浪费了棉纱，因而在试验染色中表现束手束脚的时候，党支部建议行政上立即送了一些好棉纱给他作试验，并且根据试验的需要，陆续增添了部分仪器设备。当他试验成功、使用代色的时候，部分工人有对抗情绪，党组织又指示工会教育和说服了工人，号召工人向私方技术人员学习，尊重他们的技术指导。最后在全体职工和技术人员的协助之下，这个公司终于成功地采用了代色，使每块棉纱的染色材料成本降低80％左右，仅1955年就节省了1万多元。刘濯泉因此受到表扬和奖励，这就更加激发了他的工作热情。这个公司的工程师、私方人员赵次雪年老多病，党组织建议行政上让他上午工作，下午休息，党和行政的负责干部还到他的家里看望他。赵次雪深受感动，工作更加积极，带病给实习生讲课和编写讲义，并且主动要求领导上调人和他一起工作，愿意把他在利和公司工作30多年的技术经验全部教给他们。这个公司的党组织和行政也没有忽略对私方人员的思想改造工作。当一些私方人员因为在工作中出了差错而表现消极的时候，党组织就及时地对他们进行批评教育，使他们认识了自己的错误。在日常的工作中，有意识地用一些具体的事例，教育他们逐渐克服不相信和不依靠工人群众的单纯技术观点，使他们学会了一些社会主义的经营管理方法。
    但是，像利和织物公司这样的党支部，在我们党内还不是很多的。我们的党和国家工作人员以及职工群众中有一部分人，曾经因为对于改造资本主义工商业的方针政策和国内阶级关系的变化缺乏正确的了解，因而有一度不愿意进行团结和改造资产阶级分子的工作；有些人虽然勉强接受了党分配的任务，但是因为怕被资产阶级思想所腐蚀，就对资产阶级分子采取了敬而远之的态度；有的在工作中对资本家只进行批评，不进行必要的表扬和鼓励。最近一个时期，经过党内外广泛的宣传教育，这种表面上左的而实质上右的思想作风已经有了很大的克服，但是还没有完全解决问题。今天还有少数党员、国家机关干部和职工，仍然有不愿意同资产阶级分子一起工作和怕麻烦的思想情绪。因此，党组织和工会必须善于利用当前运动中涌现出来的许多动人的事例，进一步对党员干部和职工群众进行宣传教育，彻底批判和纠正在改造资本主义工商业工作中各种各样“左”的和右的思想情绪；同时还要注意总结推广成功的经验，以便在团结和改造资产阶级分子的工作中创造出一套行之有效的方法。这样就能保证这一具有世界历史意义的、团结和改造资产阶级分子的工作取得更大的胜利。
