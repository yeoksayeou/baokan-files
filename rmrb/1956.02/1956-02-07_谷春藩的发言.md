Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

These past few days, I have attended a series of meetings and listened to a series of reports, clarifying the plans and prospects for our country's revolutionary development over the next 12 years. I am very excited. We are now "in the midst of a great upsurge of socialist revolution," and under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we are victoriously and healthily passing through the final stage of the Chinese revolution.

After this revolution, the various economic components left over from the era of the Common Program, that is, the various forms of ownership of the means of production, will undergo fundamental changes. Individual laborers' ownership and capitalists' ownership will be eliminated. Ownership by the whole people and cooperative ownership will achieve complete victory throughout the country. The change in the old relations of production will surely greatly promote the development of the productive forces. The high tide of agricultural cooperation has already triggered a high tide of handicraft industry cooperation and joint state-private ownership of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and is causing a high tide of socialist competition among workers nationwide, as well as a high tide of agricultural and industrial production throughout the country. The 40-article agricultural development program and the long-term plan for scientific research, which are currently being discussed, will surely further organize and mobilize the strength of the people throughout the country, and further promote the high tide of the entire national economy and scientific culture.

The great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao are leading us to basically complete the socialist revolution in China within three years, and to complete it peacefully. This is a great creation of Mao Zedong Thought unprecedented in world history.

Of course, to complete a socialist revolution within three years, the task is significant, and it should not be said that the future is without difficulties or that it does not require great effort. I am a postal worker. From the perspective of my work, it must be admitted that I have fallen behind the situation. At least my own ideological level is low, and my foresight is insufficient. I did not foresee that the national socialist revolution would come so quickly and be so vast and grand. Now, facing the demands of the national agricultural cooperation high tide, within seven years, we must popularize the postal network in rural areas nationwide, and do a good job in postal delivery and newspaper distribution; facing the task of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the targets; facing the situation of the masses of workers actively launching socialist competition; facing the requirements for long-term development of scientific research, I myself feel that my thinking lags behind reality, and my leadership lags behind the masses. However, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have begun to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. I believe that with the support of the broad masses of the people, we can catch up, and in some aspects, we can strive to complete the tasks ahead of schedule.

I am an intellectual. In the past few years, under the cultivation of the Party and the government, through work and study, although I have also carried out some self-reform, it is still far from enough. The shortcomings in my work precisely demonstrate the problems in my way of thinking. Now, within three years, China will basically complete the socialist revolution. The demand for ideological reform of intellectuals is even more urgent. Premier Zhou mentioned in his report "the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals in the socialist cause." Such a formulation shows that intellectuals have a glorious position and a serious responsibility in the socialist cause. Intellectuals can no longer maintain that state of ideological "joint state-private ownership." They must closely integrate with the masses in the socialist cause, to exert their strength, do their job well, and cultivate new forces. This is also self-reform. Now workers, peasants, handicraftsmen, and even industrialists and businessmen are all advancing together. They have issued a call for competition to intellectuals with practical actions. I think intellectuals must have the courage to accept this challenge. I am one of those who has signed up to answer the call.

Comrades! The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have already pointed out the path for us. We must accept Chairman Mao's teachings, work honestly and diligently, and together with the workers and peasants, encourage and help each other, to complete the tasks that the socialist revolution has given us.

    谷春藩的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    这几天来，我参加了一系列的会议，听了一系列的报告，明确了我国革命发展12年内的规划和远景，我非常兴奋。我们现在已经“处在伟大的社会主义革命高潮中”了，而且在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，是在胜利地健康地经过中国革命的最后一关了。
    经过了这一次革命，共同纲领时代遗留下来的各种经济成份，就是各种生产资料所有制，将发生本质上的变化。个体劳动者所有制和资本家所有制将会消灭。全民所有制和合作社所有制将在全国范围内取得完全的胜利。旧生产关系的改变，一定会得大大地推进生产力的发展。农业合作化高潮已经引起了手工业合作化和私营工商业公私合营的高潮，正在引起全国工人社会主义竞赛的高潮、全国农业生产和工业生产的高潮。40条农业发展纲要和正在商订的科学研究远景规划，一定会得进一步起到组织动员全国人民的力量，进一步推动整个国民经济和科学文化的高潮。
    伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导我们要在三年之内基本上完成中国的社会主义革命，而且用和平的方法来完成它，这是世界历史上没有的毛泽东思想的伟大的创造。
    当然要在三年之内完成一个社会主义革命，任务是重大的，也不应该说前途是没有困难，不需要多大努力的。我是个邮政工作者。从我的工作而说，应该承认是落在形势后面了。至少我自己的思想水平低，预见性不够，没有预见到全国社会主义革命会来得这样快，而且这样广阔浩大。现在，面对着全国农业合作化高潮的要求，七年之内，要在全国乡村中普及邮政纲，做好邮电传递和报刊发行工作；面对着提前和超额完成五年计划的任务；面对着职工群众积极展开社会主义竞赛的形势；面对着长期发展科学研究的要求；我自己感觉到思想落后于实际，领导落后于群众。但是，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们开始克服了右倾保守思想。我相信，在广大人民支持下，我们是赶得上去的，并且，在某些方面，是可以争取提前完成的。
    我是一个知识分子。几年以来，在党和政府的培养下，通过工作，通过学习，虽然也进行了一些自我改造，但还是很不够。工作的缺点，正是表现了思想方法上的毛病。现在，三年之内，中国基本上要完成社会主义革命了。知识分子思想改造的要求更迫切了。周总理在报告中说到“工人、农民和知识分子在社会主义事业中的联盟”，这样的提法，说明知识分子在社会主义事业中有光荣的地位，也有严肃的责任。知识分子再不能维持那种思想上的“公私合营”状态了。必须在社会主义事业中，与群众密切结合，来发挥自己的力量，做好自己的工作，并培养新生的力量。这也就是自我改造。现在工人、农民、手工业者以至工商业者一齐前进了，他们用实际行动向知识分子发出了竞赛的号召，我想知识分子一定有勇气来接受这挑战。我就是报名应战的一个。
    同志们！中国共产党和毛主席已经给我们指出了道路。我们必须接受毛主席的教训，老老实实、勤勤恳恳地工作，和工人农民一道，互勉互助，完成社会主义革命给我们的任务。
