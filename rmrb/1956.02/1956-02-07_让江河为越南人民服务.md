Let Rivers Serve the Vietnamese People
By Our Correspondent in Vietnam, Zhan Chao

In Vietnamese, the word for country is "Nuoc," which means water.

Water occupies a particularly important position in the lives of the Vietnamese people. Just looking at a map, you can see that to the east, the ocean parallels Vietnam's land for more than 3,000 kilometers from north to south; to the west, countless rivers, large and small, run through the entire territory of Vietnam like veins. Therefore, in the minds of the Vietnamese people, the country and water are inseparable.

How to control and utilize water is a matter of paramount importance in Vietnam's reconstruction.

Since the restoration of peace, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has done a great deal of work in this area in the past year or so. In July 1954, as soon as the gunfire stopped, the government of the Democratic Republic immediately began to repair the irrigation projects in northern Vietnam. By the summer of 1955, the nine major irrigation systems, dozens of large and small sluice gates, more than 1,500 kilometers of canals, and more than 4,600 kilometers of ditches, distributed in the Red River Delta, the coastal plains of central Vietnam, and the hilly areas of northern Vietnam, had been basically repaired. The Red River, the Zhu River, and many large and small rivers once again began to pour the water, symbolizing life, into more than 350,000 hectares of land that had been dry for many years. In the spring of 1955, the Vietnamese government also began to build large-scale flood and tide control projects. More than 1.3 million people in 19 provinces in northern Vietnam and the three cities of Hanoi, Nam Dinh, and Hai Phong actively participated in this work. In less than 5 months, more than 3,000 kilometers of river dikes and sea dikes, from the middle reaches of the Red River to the coast, were reinforced or heightened. A total of 11.5 million cubic meters of earthwork, more than 240,000 cubic meters of stonework, and more than 400 large and small culverts were completed. This figure is equal to the total amount of work done by the French colonialists in 8 years of rule. At the same time, with the attention of the government of the Democratic Republic, medium and small-scale water conservancy projects have also developed in various parts of the north. In 1955, the government of the Democratic Republic issued huge agricultural loans, of which more than 290 million yuan (Vietnamese currency) was used to help farmers build small sluice gates, canals, wells, or drain waterlogged areas. In the past year, the people in the mountainous Viet Bac Autonomous Region have built more than 7,000 canals and ditches, which, when connected, are more than a thousand kilometers long.

Without the restoration and development of water conservancy, the situation of agricultural production in northern Vietnam would be unimaginable. In 1945, the disaster in northern Vietnam did not last too long, but it caused a shocking famine that killed more than 2 million people. Last year—1955, although northern Vietnam suffered continuous attacks from natural disasters such as drought, floods, and typhoons after a long war, and some areas were affected for more than 10 months, thanks to the active rescue efforts of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, especially in the process of leading the masses to help themselves through production, the restoration and development of water conservancy not only overcame the disasters, but also created conditions for a bumper autumn harvest. Last year, the area affected by the spring drought was quite wide. In addition to organizing the masses to build large-scale water conservancy projects by providing work as a form of relief, the government also mobilized the masses to dredge ditches, dig wells, and carry water to sow seeds, leading the masses to reclaim wasteland and plant sweet potatoes and various early-maturing crops. Later, many places were attacked by tides, and the government led the masses to build dikes and dams, drain waterlogged areas, and rescue seedlings. The typhoon that struck suddenly in late September was the largest in decades, causing major damage to many provinces in the Red River Delta, especially in coastal areas. The government took timely measures. In addition to helping the victims repair their houses and solve other difficulties by providing relief or launching mutual assistance, the main focus was on organizing the masses to dig canals and wells, use fresh water to flush the fields flooded by seawater, straighten the fallen seedlings one by one, and apply additional fertilizer. As a result, the production situation was good.

On the basis of the victory in 1955, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam approved the "1956 National Plan" to finally realize the task of restoring the economy two years after the war. This plan still focuses on restoring and developing agricultural production in the north, because this is the foundation for restoring and developing industry and other production undertakings. The "1956 National Plan" requires that agricultural production in northern Vietnam should achieve self-sufficiency in grain. At the same time, it should expand the planting area of economic crops such as cotton, sugar cane, and tobacco, which will fundamentally change the abnormal phenomenon of agricultural production caused by the colonialist economy in history. In the past, the rich northern Vietnam not only could not achieve self-sufficiency in industrial raw materials such as cotton, but even rice had to rely on the south for supply every year. The colonialists deliberately created an extremely unbalanced state of the national economy in Vietnam in order to better control the south's rice, rubber, and the north's minerals. In order to solve the grain problem, the "1956 National Plan" requires that agricultural production in northern Vietnam should reach or even exceed the pre-war level. Its specific indicators are: In 1956, compared with 1955, the output of rice should increase by 22%, the output of miscellaneous grains should increase by 49%, and other economic crops, forestry, and animal husbandry should also have a large increase. Facing such a huge task of restoring and developing agricultural production, the water conservancy cause in northern Vietnam will also have a major development in 1956, and the fundamental management of the Red River has also been put on the agenda. The funds used for agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy in northern Vietnam in 1956 will account for 20% of the total investment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

It is expected that in 1956, the land reform movement in Vietnam, except for ethnic minority areas, will be fully completed. Land reform liberated rural productive forces and greatly improved farmers' enthusiasm for production. Now, many mutual aid and exchange work groups and supply and marketing cooperatives have emerged in the rural areas of northern Vietnam. People are organized not only to improve farming techniques on the original land, but also to use their surplus strength to expand the cultivated area. More than 130,000 hectares of wasteland left by the French colonialists in northern Vietnam by creating "no-man's lands" have been reclaimed by about 95,000 hectares in 1955. The Vietnamese people are determined to reclaim all the remaining wasteland in 1956. In the Red River Delta and some other places, there were many rice fields that were often waterlogged in the past, and could only grow one crop a year. After the farmers organized themselves to open canals and dig ditches, they developed water conservancy and drained waterlogged areas, turning many single-season rice fields into double-season rice fields.

Spring plowing has already begun in the fields of northern Vietnam. This year's spring plowing is combined with the development of mass water conservancy projects. In Tam Ha district, Hai Ninh province, 52 mutual aid and exchange work groups dug two long canals in one month, which can irrigate more than 2,000 mu of land (North Vietnamese mu, each mu is about 5+ Chinese mu); Farmers in Hung Yen province jointly dug a 5-kilometer-long drainage canal, turning more than 1,200 mu of single-season rice into double-season rice; The Vi Tien-Kim Bang water conservancy project in Ha Nam province, which started last year and has a total length of 138 kilometers of canals and ditches, can irrigate 20,000 hectares of paddy fields, is about to be completed.

In northern Vietnam, the task of water conservancy construction is very heavy and cannot be completed in a short time. However, in the past year, the water conservancy cause in northern Vietnam has made great progress. Under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, rivers will better serve the restoration and development of agriculture and other production undertakings in northern Vietnam, and serve the Vietnamese people.

    让江河为越南人民服务
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    越南话把国家叫作“诺”，就是水的意思。
    水，在越南人民生活里占有特殊重要的位置。只要翻开地图就可以看到：在东边，海洋和越南的国土相平行，自北到南整整有3，000多公里长；在西边，无数条大大小小的河流，像脉络似地贯穿着越南的全部国土。因此，在越南人民的心目中，国家和水是分不开的。
    怎样控制水和利用水，是越南恢复建设中一件具有头等重要意义的事情。
    和平恢复后，在过去一年多的时间里，越南民主共和国在这方面已经作了巨大的工作。1954年7月，当枪声刚一停止，民主共和国政府就立即着手修复越南北方的水利灌溉工程。到1955年夏天，分布在红河三角洲、中越滨海平原和北越丘陵地带的九大灌溉系统，几十座大小水闸、1，500多公里长的水渠和4，600多公里长的水沟，都已经基本上修复了，红河、朱江以及许多大小河流又重新开始把象征着生命的水，灌注到干裂了多年的35万多公顷的田地里。1955年春天，越南政府又开始着手修建规模巨大的防汛和防潮工程，越南北方19个省和河内、南定、海防3个市130多万群众积极参加了这一工作，在不满5个月的时间里，自红河中游直到沿海的3，000多公里长的河堤和海堤都加固或加高了，总共做了1，150万土方、24万多石方和400多个大小涵洞。这个数目字，等于过去法国殖民者统治时期8年工程量的总和。同时，在民主共和国政府的关注下，北方各地的中、小型水利事业也有了发展。民主共和国政府1955年发放了巨额的农业贷款，其中有29，000多万元（越币）是用来扶助农民兴修小型水闸、沟渠、水井或排除积水的。在过去的一年里，多山的越北联区群众所修筑的水渠和水沟共有7，000多条，把它们连接起来整整有上千公里长。
    要是没有水利事业的恢复和发展，越南北方农业生产的局面是不堪设想的。1945年，越南北方灾情延续的时间并不太长，但是却造成了200多万人死亡的一次骇人听闻的大饥荒。去年——1955年，越南北方虽然在长期战争之后又遭到旱、涝、台风等自然灾害连续的袭击，有些地区受灾期竟达10个多月，但是由于越南民主共和国政府积极的救治，特别是在领导群众生产自救的过程中恢复和发展了水利事业，这样不仅渡过了灾荒，而且为秋粮丰收创造了条件。去年春旱的面积相当广，政府除了用以工代赈的办法组织群众修建大型水利工程外，并发动群众掏沟、挖井和挑水点种，带领群众开荒，种植薯类和各种早熟作物。后来许多地方又遭潮水的袭击，政府便带领群众修堤筑坝、排除积水，抢救青苗。9月下旬突然袭来的台风是几十年来最大的一次，红河三角洲许多省份特别是沿海地区遭受较大的灾害。政府及时地采取措施，除了以救济或发动互济方式帮助受灾者修复房舍和解决其他困难之外，主要组织群众开渠挖井，用淡水冲刷被海水淹浸过的田地，把倒下的秧苗一株株地扶直并加上追肥，结果生产情况良好。
    在1955年胜利的基础之上，越南民主共和国政府通过了最后实现战后两年恢复经济任务的“1956年国家计划”。这个计划仍然以恢复和发展北方的农业生产为主要任务，因为这是恢复和发展工业以及其他生产事业的基础。“1956年国家计划”要求越南北方的农业生产要达到粮食自给，同时，扩大棉花、甘蔗、烟叶等经济作物的耕种面积，这将根本改变历史上殖民主义经济所造成的农业生产的畸形现象。在过去，富饶的越南北方不仅棉花等工业原料不能自给，甚至连大米每年都要依靠南方供应。殖民主义者故意造成越南全国经济极端不平衡的状态，以便更好地控制南方的大米、橡胶以及北方的矿产。为了解决粮食问题，“1956年国家计划”要求越南北方农业生产要达到甚至超过战前水平。它的具体指标是：1956年比1955年，大米的产量增加22％，杂粮的产量增加49％，其他经济作物、林业和畜牧业等也要有很大的增加。面临着这样巨大的恢复和发展农业生产的任务，越南北方的水利事业在1956年内也将要有重大的发展，根本治理红河的任务也被提到议事日程上来了。越南北方农林水利事业1956年所用的资金，将占越南民主共和国投资总额的20％。
    预计在1956年内，除少数民族地区，越南的土地改革运动将要全部完成。土地改革解放了农村生产力，使农民的生产积极性大大地提高了。现在，在越南北方的农村里已经出现了许多互助换工组和供销合作社。人们组织起来，不仅在原有的土地上改进耕作技术，而且用剩余的力量去扩展耕地面积，法国殖民主义者过去在越南北方制造“无人区”遗留下来的13万多公顷荒地，1955年已经开垦了约有95，000公顷，越南人民决心要在1956年内把剩下来的荒地全部开垦完。在红河三角洲和其他的一些地方，过去有很多稻田经常积水，一年只能种一季庄稼。经过农民组织起来开渠、挖沟，既发展了水利、又排除了积水，使许多一季稻田变成了两季稻田。
    春耕已经在越南北方的田野里展开了。今年的春耕是和发展群众性的水利事业结合起来进行的。海宁省淡河县52个互助换工组，一个月里挖了两条长水渠，可以灌溉两千多亩田（北越亩，每亩约等于中国5亩多）；兴安省农民合伙挖了一条5公里长的排水水渠，使1，200多亩单季稻变成双季稻；从去年动工的渠沟总长度138公里、可以灌溉2万公顷水田的河南省维先—金榜水利工程即将完成。
    在越南北方，水利建设的任务十分繁重，不是短时间内可以完成的，但是，在过去的一年，越南北方的水利事业已经有了极大的发展。在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的英明领导下，江河将会更好地为越南北方农业以及其他生产事业的恢复和发展服务，为越南人民服务。
