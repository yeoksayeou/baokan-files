Hubei Province to Significantly Increase Hog Raising This Year

The Hubei Provincial People's Committee recently convened a meeting of relevant departments and decided that the province will raise 700,000 hogs this year, an increase of 69.2% compared to last year.

This year, Hubei Province will mobilize all farmers to raise one hog per household, with more in mountainous areas like western Hubei. This year, Hubei Province will also plant feed crops in a planned way, massively breed piglets, and carry out hog disease prevention work. From this year to next year, more than 200,000 agricultural producers' cooperative breeders will receive basic technical training in livestock breeding, management, and disease prevention. The province's first secondary school of animal husbandry and veterinary technology will also be established this year.

    湖北省今年将大量增养生猪
    湖北省人民委员会最近召集有关部门开会，决定今年全省要养猪70万头，比去年增加69.2％。
    今年，湖北省要动员全省农户每户养一头猪，鄂西等山区还要养得多一些。今年湖北省还将有计划地种植饲料作物，大量繁殖仔猪和开展防治猪疫工作。今年到明年，还要有20多万名农业生产合作社的饲养员受到牲畜繁殖、管理和防治疫病的基本技术训练。全省第一所中等畜牧兽医技术学校也将在今年建立。　（袁军）
