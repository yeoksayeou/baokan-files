    The Entire Railway System Reports Successes
   *People's Railway Daily* Reporter
    In order to welcome the National Railway Activist Representative Assembly, from Manzhouli in the north to Guangzhou in the south, and from Lianyungang in the east to the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction site in the west, railway workers across the long national railway lines have launched an unprecedented upsurge in socialist competition. The initiative to revise backward quotas and break new quotas has been echoed and rapidly spread to every corner of the entire railway system. Many workers are ahead of schedule, completing their Five-Year Plans ahead of time. The Harbin Railway Bureau received 1,320 reports of success within a few days. The Qiqihar Railway Bureau employees proposed 9,679 revisions to backward quotas and 85 rationalization proposals in two days. The Shenyang Railway Bureau's over-axle plan was revised three times and broken three times in half a month. The Nanjing Branch Bureau broke 163 quotas and created new records in a single day, January 25th. Across the national railway lines, there are sounds of congratulations and reports of successes everywhere.
    The vast number of workers are using their pioneering spirit of eliminating the old and bringing forth the new to break through outdated quotas. The suggestion of Mao Zedong locomotive driver Yue Shangwu and others to increase the traction tonnage has been extended to 12 bureaus, almost all sections, even the severely cold Northeast region is no exception. "Let the wind and snow give way, let the high slopes bow their heads" is the bold statement of the vast number of locomotive crew members to accelerate socialist construction. In the past, the section between Hailar and Manzhouli required an additional locomotive to pull 1,100 tons. Now, the crew members of the Manzhouli Locomotive Depot, overcoming heavy snow and temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius, are mostly pulling 1,300 tons without the need for an additional locomotive. After Geng Benshan, a driver from the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot, proposed completing one million ton-kilometers per locomotive per day, their crew team has exceeded this target for three consecutive days. Wang Shoufu, Li Dajun, Song Yuanguo, Li Chunhai, and other crew teams have all achieved one million ton-kilometers per locomotive per day. In order to ensure the safe and rapid operation of fully loaded, over-axle trains, the Guilin, Cangxian, and Fengtai engineering sections have proposed increasing the permissible speed of the lines. The dispatchers of the Nanchang Branch Bureau worked closely with the drivers, and the number of fast over-axle trains organized from January 16th to 24th increased by 1.3 times compared to the previous month, and the tonnage increased by 2.7 times. Many workers, in order to improve their work, start implementing suggestions before leadership approval; some even pay for materials to make tools themselves; others actively demonstrate to convince the leadership that the suggestions are feasible. This high level of enthusiasm for building socialism and selfless labor enthusiasm among workers is an important sign of the new upsurge in labor competition.
    The surging tide of competition is impacting every corner of the entire railway system, washing over every worker. The advanced are becoming even more advanced, and those in the middle and lagging behind are catching up. The engineering of the First Engineering Section of the First Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Construction General Bureau had been progressing slowly in the past. In this upsurge of competition, the workers gave play to their initiative and creativity and caught up with the advanced units, completing the erection of six spans of steel beams in 7 hours, creating a new bridge-building record for the bureau. Li Xianglai, a driver from the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, used to frequently experience delays, waste coal, and fail to achieve over-axle loads, earning him the nickname "San Xianglai" (Always Delayed, Always Wasting Coal, Always Not Over-Axle). Now, Li Xianglai has transformed himself and is now saving coal, on time, and achieving over-axle loads. Gu Shishun, a worker from the Jiamusi Construction Section, used to take a don't-ask-don't-tell attitude in every movement, and the masses called him "Deaf Gu." This time, he actively participated in the competition and proposed 20 revisions to backward quotas. The crew members of the Luoyang Locomotive Depot increased the traction tonnage between Zhengzhou and Luoyang to 1,700 tons. The leadership was afraid it wouldn't work and didn't actively support it, but even Yang Yongkang's crew on locomotive No. 273, who didn't usually achieve over-axle loads, pulled 1,714 tons in heavy snow. Yang Yongkang's transformation provided a good education for the leadership. Zhang Zhaoxuan, an old worker from the Datong Locomotive Depot, had not been able to complete his quota since May of last year. In the upsurge of competition, he improved his operating methods, exceeded his quota by 103% on January 28th, and has now also proposed revisions to backward quotas. He said: Socialism wants us to move quickly, and I can no longer lag behind, I must catch up. This is not only what Zhang Zhaoxuan is thinking, but also the resonance in the hearts of the vast number of workers.
    In this new upsurge of competition, even the guarantee departments and even family members have actively joined in; not only are the workers enthusiastic, but also the technical personnel are actively taking action. The entire staff of the First Design Institute proposed: Guarantee to deliver the design documents for the Urumqi to the border section six months ahead of schedule; deliver the design documents for the Yumen to Hami section three months ahead of schedule; and deliver the design documents for the Lanzhou-Yinchuan and Lanzhou-Qinghai sections ahead of schedule. The surveying and mapping section of the Third Design Institute proposed that the design of a certain line create a standardized diagram of complex calculation methods during operation, improving efficiency fourfold. Li Jian, a technician from the Sixth Engineering Bureau, created a hole-blocking grouting method in the No. 28 tunnel project, increasing grouting efficiency fourfold and saving 14 bags of cement per meter. On January 20th, Wang Baogui, the duty captain of the Pukou boat, and Wang Shuangsheng, the captain of the Nanjing boat, both shortened the sailing time to 12 and 10.5 minutes respectively in force six winds and high tide, breaking the previous record. The medical staff of the Zhenjiang Health Clinic improved their work, shortening the waiting time from 30 minutes to 12 minutes. Many regions' workers' families have also joined the competition upsurge. Ten family committees in the Jinzhou area proposed competition guarantee conditions.
    Many leading cadres have also been educated in this competition upsurge, inspected and criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, changed their work style, went deep into reality, went deep into the masses, actively supported the suggestions of advanced workers, and discovered and supported the sprouts of new people, new things, and new experiences.
    Currently, there are still many shortcomings in the competition: many leading cadres are afraid of being labeled as "conservative" in the competition upsurge, and are hesitant, failing to guide the masses' high labor enthusiasm well and solve problems in production; some workers have a tendency to pursue quantity and neglect quality. Advanced workers helping backward workers to advance together is not enough. The future task is to strengthen organization and leadership, and further give play to the leading, backbone, and bridging role of advanced workers.

    全路一片报捷声
   人民铁道报记者
    为了迎接全国铁路活动分子代表大会，北起满洲里，南至广州，东由连云，西到兰新铁路工地，铁路职工们在漫长的全国铁路线上，掀起了空前的社会主义竞赛高潮。修改落后定额突破新定额的创举，一呼百应地急速向全路每个角落发展。不少职工跑在时间前面，纷纷提前完成五年计划。哈尔滨局几天内收到捷报1，320件。齐齐哈尔局职工两天内提出修改落后定额9，679件，合理化建议85件。沈阳局的超轴计划在半月内修改3次，被突破3次。南京分局在1月25日一天中突破定额和创造新纪录163项。在全国铁路线上，到处是贺喜报捷声。
    广大职工以除旧革新的首创精神，冲打陈旧定额。毛泽东号司机长岳尚武等提出的提高牵引定数的建议，已扩展到12个局，几乎所有区段，连严寒的东北地区也不例外。使“风雪让路，高坡低头”，是广大机车乘务员加速社会主义建设的豪语。过去赫尔洪得—满洲里间，牵引1，100吨还要补机，现在，满洲里机务段乘务员们战胜大风雪和零下30多度严寒，大部分都不要补机牵引1，300吨。苏家屯机务段司机耿本善提出完成日车百万吨公里倡议后，他们包车组已连续3天突破这个目标，王寿福、李大钧、宋元国、李春海等包车组都达到日车百万吨公里。为了保证满载超轴列车安全迅速运行，桂林、沧县、丰台等工务段提出了提高线路容许速度的倡议。南昌分局调度人员同司机密切配合，从1月16日到24日组织的快速超轴列车，比上月份增加一点三倍，吨数增加二点七倍。很多职工为了改进工作，等不及领导上批准建议，就先着手实行；有的甚至自己出钱买材料做工具；有的为了使领导上相信建议切实可行，主动示范表演。职工们这种建设社会主义的高度积极性和忘我的劳动热情，是劳动竞赛新高涨的重要标志。
    汹涌的竞赛浪潮，冲击着全路每个角落，使每个职工都受到了洗礼。先进的更先进了，中间的和落后的也迎头赶上。新建铁路工程总局第一工程局第一工程段的工程，过去一直进展迟缓，在这次竞赛高潮中，工人群众发挥积极性创造性，赶上了先进单位，在7小时内架完6孔钢梁，创一局架桥新纪录。丰台机务段司机李相来，过去经常运缓、费煤、不超轴，人们送他一个绰号叫“三向来”（向来运缓、向来费煤、向来不超轴）。现在，李相来转变了，已经作到既省煤、正点，又能超轴。佳木斯建筑段工人古世顺在过去每个运动中都抱不闻不问的态度，群众叫他“古聋子”。这次他也积极投入竞赛，提出修改落后定额20件。洛阳机务段乘务员们把郑州洛阳间牵引定数提高为1，700吨，领导上怕行不通，不积极支持，但是连过去不大超轴的273号机车杨永康机班也在大雪天拉了1，714吨。杨永康的转变给领导上一个很好的教育。大同机务段老工人张兆宣从去年5月以来总完不成定额，在竞赛高潮中，他改进了操作方法，1月28日突破定额103％，现在也提出修改落后定额的建议。他说：社会主义要我们快走，我再不能拉后了，必须赶上去。这不仅是张兆宣心里的话，也是广大职工内心的共鸣。
    在这次新的竞赛高潮中，连保证部门甚至家属也积极卷入竞赛了；不仅工人热情高涨，而且技术人员也积极行动。第一设计院全体工作人员提出：保证提前半年交出乌鲁木齐到国境的设计文件；提前3个月交出玉门到哈密的设计文件；并提前交出兰银段、兰青路的设计文件。第三设计院勘测科提出某线设计在运营中把复杂的计算方法作成定型图，提高效率四倍。第六工程局技术员李俭在28号隧道工程中创造堵眼灌注法，提高灌注效率四倍，每公尺节省水泥14袋。1月20日南京轮渡所浦口号值班船长王宝贵、南京号船长王双生分别在六级大风、涨潮的天气里，航行时间缩短为12和10.5分钟，打破过去的纪录。镇江卫生所医务工作人员改进了工作，使候诊时间由30分钟缩短为12分钟。许多地区的职工家属也投入竞赛高潮。锦州地区10个家属委员会提出了竞赛保证条件。
    不少领导工作人员也在这次竞赛高潮中受到教育，检查批判了右倾保守思想，转变了工作作风，深入实际，深入群众，积极支持先进工人的建议，发现并扶植新人物、新事物、新经验的萌芽。
    目前竞赛还存在不少缺点：不少领导工作人员在竞赛高潮中怕戴保守“帽子”，畏首畏尾，没有很好地引导群众高涨的劳动热情，解决生产中的问题；部分职工存在追求数量、忽视质量偏向。先进职工帮助落后职工，使大家共同前进还不够。今后的任务是加强组织领导，进一步发挥先进工作者的带头、骨干、桥梁作用。
