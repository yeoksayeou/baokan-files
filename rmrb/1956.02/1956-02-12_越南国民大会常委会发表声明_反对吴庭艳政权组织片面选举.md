Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 10th. The Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a temporary meeting on February 9th, presided over by Chairman Ton Duc Thang.

The meeting heard reports regarding the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's organization of unilateral elections in South Vietnam, the establishment of a separate "National Assembly," and the establishment of concentration camps to persecute those who did not support Ngo Dinh Diem's dictatorial policies, and passed a statement opposing the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's organization of unilateral elections in South Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that after the Ngo Dinh Diem clique staged the farce of a "referendum" last October, they are now scheduled to hold unilateral elections in South Vietnam on March 4th of this year, which is a serious violation and destruction of the Geneva Accords. These actions are part of a conspiracy by the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem to permanently divide Vietnam, turn South Vietnam into a US military base and colony, and re-ignite the war. They not only undermine the peace and unification of Vietnam, but also threaten peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

The statement said that Ngo Dinh Diem's actions have aroused national anger and have been opposed by world opinion. Even in South Vietnam, despite the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities' blatant acts of terror, the people of the South are still constantly struggling. Not only are various religious sects and opposition parties against Ngo Dinh Diem, but also some individuals and organizations who once supported Ngo Dinh Diem now oppose him.

Faced with the serious situation provoked by the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem, the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people warmly welcome and support the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China for the reconvening of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, because this is an extremely correct proposal to resolve the current serious situation in Vietnam and also conforms to the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world.

The National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on France, the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference, and the member states of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam to take active measures to correctly fulfill their respective responsibilities to guarantee the implementation of the Geneva Accords and consolidate peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world.

The statement concluded by saying that the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on compatriots at home and abroad to unite widely and closely on the basis of the program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and strive to fight against the unilateral elections of the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem and their fascist terrorist regime.

The National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam welcomes all individuals and organizations to take actions that are conducive to peace and unification and to the great national unity against the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem.

    越南国民大会常委会发表声明
    反对吴庭艳政权组织片面选举
    新华社河内10日电　越南民主共和国国民大会常务委员会2月9日在孙德胜委员长主持下，召开了临时会议。
    会议听取了有关吴庭艳政权在越南南方组织片面选举、成立单独的“国会”和建立集中营来迫害不赞成吴庭艳独裁政策的人们的报告，并且通过了一项关于反对吴庭艳政权在越南南方组织片面选举的声明。
    声明中指出，吴庭艳集团在去年10月扮演了“公民投票”的丑剧以后，又定于今年3月4日在越南南方举行片面选举，这是对日内瓦协议的严重违反和破坏。这些行动是美国和吴庭艳企图长期分割越南、把南越变成美国的军事基地和殖民地、重新挑起战争的阴谋的一部分，它们不仅破坏越南的和平和统一，而且还威胁着东南亚和世界的和平。
    声明说，吴庭艳的这种行动已经激起了全国的愤怒，并且遭到了世界舆论的反对。即使在越南南方，尽管吴庭艳当局明目张胆地进行恐怖行动，南方人民仍然在不断地进行斗争，不但各个教派和各个反对党反对吴庭艳，而且一些曾经支持吴庭艳的人士和组织，现在也反对吴庭艳。
    面对着美国和吴庭艳挑起的严重局势，越南民主共和国国民大会和越南人民热烈欢迎并且支持中华人民共和国政府关于重新召开有关印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的建议，因为这是解决越南目前的严重局势同时也是符合于全世界爱好和平人民的意愿的极为正确的建议。
    越南民主共和国国民大会要求法国、1954年日内瓦会议参加国和越南国际监督和监察委员会成员国采取积极的办法，正确地按照各国应尽的责任来保证日内瓦协议的履行，巩固印度支那、东南亚和世界的和平。
    声明最后说，越南民主共和国国民大会号召国内外同胞在越南祖国战线纲领的基础上广泛地紧密团结起来，为反对美国和吴庭艳的片面选举和它们的法西斯恐怖制度而努力斗争。
    越南民主共和国国民大会欢迎一切个人和组织采取有利于和平和统一、有利于反对美国和吴庭艳的民族大团结的行动。
