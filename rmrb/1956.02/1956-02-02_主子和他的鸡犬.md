    The Master and His Chickens and Dogs

    The Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial on January 24, exposing that the South Korean Lee Syngman group's naval vessels frequently violated Japanese sovereignty, sailing into Japanese military ports such as Yokosuka without notifying the Japanese government. The newspaper said that these ships entered and exited freely, completely disregarding the Japanese customs authorities.

    Needless to say, the Lee Syngman group's disregard for Japanese sovereignty relies on the influence of its American master. Therefore, these few words spoken by the "Asahi Shimbun" to safeguard Japanese sovereignty were a bit harsh to the ears of the U.S. Far East Naval Authorities. The U.S. Far East Naval Headquarters immediately issued an official reprimand to the "Asahi Shimbun" in the name of Commander-in-Chief Callahan. It said that the actions of the Lee Syngman Navy vessels were "part of the United Nations forces' strategy and are under the supervision and control of the U.S. Far East Naval Forces." Moreover, their actions are "confidential" "military strategic secrets." This means that the Lee Syngman group is acting according to America's "confidential" "military strategic secrets." Japan, which has given its military ports to the United States to serve as naval bases, dares to say anything?

    The usefulness of American "strategy" is truly great! In the face of American "strategy," the sovereignty of any country is not worth mentioning. Under the pretext of American "strategic" needs, the United States has the so-called "right" to "self-defense" in China's territory of Taiwan, and the "right" to station troops, establish bases, and enslave dozens of countries. Moreover, as the Chinese saying goes, "When a man achieves enlightenment, even his chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." The example of the Lee Syngman group's warships arbitrarily entering Japanese military ports illustrates that not only does the United States itself have the "right" to violate the sovereignty of other countries, but even its "chickens and dogs" also have this "right."

    For Japan, this is a vivid lesson: a person who entrusts his fate to others to control must bow down even before chickens and dogs. (Ping)

    主子和他的鸡犬
    日本“朝日新闻”在1月24日发表了一篇社论，揭露李承晚集团的海军船只经常侵犯日本的主权，不通知日本政府就开到日本的军港横须贺等处。报纸说，这些船只自由出入，完全无视日本的海关当局。
    用不着说，李承晚集团这样不把日本的主权放在眼里，是仗着它的美国主子的势头的。因此，“朝日新闻”为了维护日本主权而说的这几句话，使得美国远东海军当局听来未免有点刺耳。美国远东海军司令部立刻用总司令卡拉汉的名义向“朝日新闻”打了一通官腔。它说，李承晚海军船只的行动，是“联合国军战略的一部分，是受到美国远东海军部队的监督和控制的。”而且它们的行动是“不能透露的”“军事战略秘密”。这意思就是说，李承晚集团是按照美国的“不能透露的”“军事战略秘密”行动的，把自己的军港让给美国做海军基地的日本还敢有什么话说？
    美国“战略”的用处真是大得很！在美国的“战略”面前，任何国家的主权都不算一回事。在美国“战略”需要的借口下，在中国的领土台湾美国就有了所谓“自卫”的“权利”，在数十个国家的领土上美国就有了驻扎军队、建立基地、奴役这些国家的“权利”。而且，正如中国俗语所说，“一人成佛，鸡犬升天”，李承晚集团的军舰任意进入日本军港的例子说明，不但美国自己有了侵犯别国主权的“权利”，连它的“鸡犬”居然也有了这种“权利”了。
    对于日本来说，这倒是一个活生生的教训：一个把自己的命运交给别人去摆布的人，就是在鸡犬面前也得矮上三分。　　（平）
