To the Editor:

    On the evening of November 8, 1955, I suddenly fell ill: first my nose bled, then my mouth and eyes also bled, and I fainted several times. It was late at night, and there were no doctors nearby, so my 70-year-old mother and wife were beside themselves with anxiety.
    When the cooperative members learned of my illness, they felt as if their own brother had suffered a misfortune. They immediately sent people to take me by boat to a clinic 30 miles away for treatment. Because after the clinic's emergency treatment, I was still in a comatose and dangerous state, the cooperative specially hired a boat to take me to the Wuhan Municipal First Hospital, and also brought 200 yuan for medical expenses. After staying in the hospital for more than half a month, my illness was cured. According to the doctor, "If you had come half a day later, it would have been hopeless."
    After I recovered, the cooperative members all came to inquire about me. I offered to participate in production as soon as possible, but the cooperative members insisted that I take another period of rest. This moved me beyond words. In the past, if a poor fisherman had suffered such a serious illness, even if his life was saved, he would have been ruined! Only because there was a cooperative was I able to safely overcome this great disaster!
Guo Minghua, First Deputy Director of the Zhuotou Gou Fisheries Production Cooperative, Mianyang County, Hubei Province

    合作社救了我的命编辑同志：
    1955年11月8日晚上，我忽然得了病：先是鼻子流血，以后口里、眼里也都流血，人晕过去了几次。当时是深更半夜，附近又没有医生，我的70多岁的老母亲和妻子急得干瞪眼。
    社员们知道我生病的消息以后，就像自己的亲兄弟遭到不幸一样，马上派了人架船送我到30里外的诊所去治病。因为经过诊所急救以后，我还是处在昏迷危险状态，于是社里又专门雇船把我送到汉口市立第一医院，还带去200元钱作医药费用。在医院住了半个多月，我的病才治好了。据医生说：“如果来迟了半天，就不行了。”
    我病好回来后，社员们都跑来问候我。我提出要早些参加生产，但是社员们一定要我再休养一个时期。这可使我感动得不知如何是好了。如果在过去，1个贫苦渔民害了这样的重病，就是命保住了，也会弄得倾家荡产！只是因为有了合作社，我才能安然渡过这场巨大的灾祸！湖北沔阳县琢头沟渔业生产合作社第一副主任  郭明华
