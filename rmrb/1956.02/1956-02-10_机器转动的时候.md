    When the Machines Turn
    By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam
    With just a brief tour of North Vietnam, you will see how the striving Vietnamese people, while restoring and developing agricultural production, are actively working towards the future industrialization of their motherland.
    All possible conditions are being utilized.
    The “anti-war factories” that were once hidden in forests and stone caves—machine repair shops pieced together from various parts, printing houses using wood to replace the broken machine connecting rods, the rather old Hoang Van Thu paper mill, as well as small-scale tin mines, iron mines, and rudimentary phosphate processing plants, etc.—were immediately moved to cities or places of raw material production as soon as the war ended, and continued to operate. These original factories and enterprises in the liberated areas, although not numerous, not large in scale, and not fully equipped, are, just like during the anti-war period, trying their best to supply the needs of economic recovery and cultural development with their own products, and are diligently accumulating construction funds for the country.
    The industrial and mining enterprises in the newly liberated areas have also been properly taken over and rapidly restored to production. The Hong Gai coal mine, which was forced to shut down before the withdrawal of the French colonial army, resumed full operation on the third day after liberation; the Nam Dinh textile factory, which had 100,000 spindles and over 1,300 looms, was paralyzed because the main components of its power section were stolen by the colonialists, but thanks to the efforts of workers and technicians, it finally partially resumed production on October 15th last year, and largely resumed production in mid-December; the Hai Phong cement plant, which can produce more than 20,000 tons of cement per month, faced more difficulties. Two months before the colonialists withdrew, they drove the workers out of the factory, destroyed important parts, and stole the raw materials, but it was repaired and completed in less than half a year, and officially started production in November last year; other smaller enterprises, as long as they are helpful to economic recovery, are also trying to restore them all, such as the Nam Dinh silk factory, the Hai Phong Shipyard, the Hanoi Brewery, the Hanoi Ice Factory, etc., which all started production one after another shortly after liberation... When the still machines suddenly started turning, when the dying factories suddenly let out their first whistle, the life of the entire city returned to normal, and everything around it also became active. The rapid recovery of the original industrial and mining enterprises and other economic sectors in the new area not only provided favorable conditions for the country's overall recovery and construction work, but also solved the unemployment problem caused by the colonialists. There were 80,000 unemployed people in North Vietnam, and more than 70,000 of them were employed in 1955.
    The colonial economy, which was aimed at plunder, left behind an extremely dilapidated situation. If the Vietnamese people want to start building their own country, they must first reorganize the past economy and expand their industrial base as quickly as possible. For this purpose, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, from the first day of peace restoration, organized forces to study and plan the construction of a number of new industrial and mining enterprises. These enterprises have now started construction one after another. Some of them can be put into production in 1956, and most of them can be put into production in 1957.
    North Vietnam is extraordinarily rich in underground resources, possessing all the favorable conditions for establishing heavy industry. However, as a result of the long-term colonial rule and war destruction in the past, the exploration data of underground resources and the technical force for industrial construction are very lacking, and it is not appropriate to hold a large number of heavy industries in the early stage of post-war recovery. Therefore, the policy adopted by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to vigorously restore the original industry, small-scale industry, and handicrafts, while actively building some new industries that are urgently needed for the national economy and people's livelihood and that can be done, to serve the restoration and development of agricultural production, to gradually improve the people's material and cultural life, and to serve the long-term industrial construction in the future. According to this policy, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has built dozens of enterprises during the two-year economic recovery period, including machine manufacturing plants, agricultural tool factories, phosphate plants, sawmills, paper mills, tea processing plants, fish canneries, fruit canneries, and power plants for these factories, which are several times more than the factories and mines originally built by the colonialists in decades to exploit the Vietnamese people. In this way, the economic strength of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will be greatly enhanced.
    In order to lay a preliminary foundation for industrialization, the "1956 National Plan" approved by the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam stipulates that the funds invested in industry this year should account for 38% of the country's total construction funds, which are mainly used to build new industrial and mining enterprises; at the same time, the state also requires the original industry, small-scale industry, and handicrafts to strive to increase production and accumulate funds, so as to better support agricultural production, especially the basic construction tasks of industry. According to the plan, the total industrial output value this year should increase by 517% compared with last year. By completing this target, the industrial output of North Vietnam can reach the highest level before the war in 1939.
    The Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's proposals to actively heal the wounds of war and start building the country's industrial base during the period of national economic recovery have been sincerely supported by the Vietnamese people, and the liberated working class has embodied the requirements of the Party and the government with practical actions. Many things that could not be done in the past are now being done. According to the past calculations of the French colonialists, it would take at least three and a half months to repair the 4-kilometer-long crane transportation system of the Hong Gai coal mine, but after liberation, the Vietnamese workers repaired it all in only 20 days. The repair work of important enterprises such as the Hai Phong cement plant and the Nam Dinh textile factory has also been completed ahead of schedule. During the resumption of work at the Nam Dinh textile factory, workers and staff voluntarily launched the "Tool Return to Factory Movement." They returned the tools, laboratory instruments, and even microscopes in hospitals that were secretly hidden in various homes during the colonial rule, solving many difficulties in the factory's restoration process.
    Due to the high enthusiasm of workers for production, the production of various industrial and mining enterprises has also grown rapidly, and many of the colonial-style "quotas" in the past have been broken one after another. The Gia Lam Railway Repair Factory in Hanoi could only overhaul one locomotive a year during the colonial era, but the Vietnamese employees overhauled 12 locomotives last year; it used to take 550 workdays to repair a carriage, but now it only takes 155 workdays; in the past, each person produced 300 screws per day, but now they produce 1,400 screws per day. The chemical silk woven by the Nam Dinh Silk Factory used to produce 9 meters per machine per day, but now it produces 14 meters per day, with a maximum of 19 meters. The Nam Dinh Textile Factory weaves 30-count yarn black fine cloth, which used to produce 9 meters per machine per shift, but now produces 15 meters, with a maximum of 19 to 20 meters. The workers are not satisfied with simply increasing production, they are also actively trying to save raw materials and reduce costs. According to preliminary statistics from the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, from January to September last year, workers in various parts of North Vietnam put forward a total of 6,000 rationalization proposals, saving the country tens of billions of Vietnamese dong. Many industrial and mining enterprise workers also automatically launched the "Scrap Collection Movement," which increased the country's income. The employees of the Hong Gai Coal Mine Bridge Construction Office picked up 34 tons of broken coal in one week, and the warehouse employees picked up 20,000 catties of waste copper and scrap iron. An old worker said: "Who would want to pick up these things for the factory in the past? We just did as much as we were told. Now I feel uncomfortable seeing these things left here unattended. When I think that this is our country's property, my hands can't help but move."
    "Our machines!" "Our factories!" "Our enterprises!" In North Vietnam, now no matter whether you go to the original factories, mines, or new basic construction sites, you can often hear or see these sentences full of pride. The Vietnamese people should be proud, they have not only taken back their factories and mines from the colonialists, but have also begun to build their own industrial and mining enterprises in a planned and step-by-step manner. Soon, new cities that have never existed before will appear in North Vietnam. These new industrial and mining enterprises, which will be completed in 1956 and 1957 according to the national plan, are the first milestones on the road of the Vietnamese people towards industrialization, prosperity, and strength.

    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    只要在越南北方各地稍为浏览一下，你就会看到奋发的越南人民在恢复和发展农业生产的同时，是怎样积极地在为自己祖国未来的工业化而努力着。
    所有一切可能的条件都被利用起来了。
    过去隐藏在森林里和石洞里的“抗战工厂”——由各种部件拼凑成的机器修理厂、拿木料顶替被炸断的机器拉杆的印刷厂、相当古老的黄文树造纸厂以及小型锡矿、铁矿、磷酸盐简陋的加工厂等等，战争刚一结束，就立即被迁移到城市里或者是原料出产地去，继续开工生产。这些解放区原有的工厂企业，虽然数量不多、规模不大、设备不全，但是却和抗战时期一样，正尽量以它们自己的产品来供应恢复经济和发展文化的需要，并且努力地为国家积累建设基金。
    新解放区的工矿企业也被妥善地接管过来，并且迅速地恢复了生产活动。法国殖民者军队撤退前被迫停顿的鸿基煤矿，在解放后的第三天就全部开工了；拥有10万纱锭、1，300多台布机的南定纺织厂，因为动力部分的主要机件被殖民者盗运走了，工厂陷于瘫痪状态，但是由于工人和技术人员的努力，终于在去年10月15日部分恢复生产，12月中旬大部恢复生产；每月可产两万多吨水泥的海防水泥厂，遇到的困难比较多，殖民者撤退前两个月就把工人赶出工厂，把重要的机件撤毁，把原料盗卖掉，但是不到半年便修复竣工了，在去年11月份已正式开始生产；其他规模比较小的企业单位，只要对恢复经济有一点助益，也尽量使它们全部加以恢复，例如南定丝绸厂、海防修船厂、河内啤酒厂、河内制冰厂等等，都在解放后不久就先后开工生产了……。当静止的机器突然转动起来的时候，当垂死的工厂突然放出第一声气笛的时候，整个城市的生活又恢复了常态，它周围的一切也都随着活跃起来了。新区原有的工矿企业以及其他经济部门的迅速恢复，不仅给国家整个恢复建设工作提供了有利的条件，同时也解决了殖民者所造成的失业问题。越南北方原有失业者8万人，在1955年内就有7万多人就了业。
    以掠夺为目的的殖民地经济，它所遗留下来的是一个异常破烂的摊子。越南人民要着手建设自己的国家，就必须首先对过去的经济进行改组，并且尽可能快地扩大自己的工业基础。为了这样的目的，越南民主共和国政府自和平恢复的第一天开始，就组织力量研究和筹划兴建一批新的工矿企业，现在这些企业都已经先后动工了，有的在1956年就可以投入生产，大部分在1957年都可以投入生产。
    越南北方的地下资源异常丰富，具备着建立重工业的一切有利条件。但是由于过去长期的殖民地统治和战争摧残的结果，地下资源的勘探资料和工业建设的技术力量都非常缺乏，在战后恢复初期要大量举办重工业是不适宜的。因此，越南民主共和国政府采取的方针是：大力恢复原有工业、小型工业和手工业，同时积极建设一些新的国计民生所急需的、又可能办到的工业，为恢复和发展农业生产服务，为逐步改善人民的物质和文化生活服务，为今后长期的工业建设服务。按照这样的方针，越南民主共和国在两年恢复经济时期中兴建的，包括有机器制造厂、农具厂、磷酸盐厂、锯木厂、造纸厂、茶叶加工厂、鱼罐头厂、水果罐头厂以及供这些工厂动力的发电厂等几十个企业，比原来殖民者为了榨取越南人民在几十年里建立的工厂矿山要多好几倍。这样，越南民主共和国的经济力量将会大大地增强起来。
    为着初步奠定工业化的基础，越南民主共和国政府部长会议通过的“1956年国家计划”规定，今年投到工业方面的资金要占国家全部建设资金的38％，其中主要是用来兴建新的工矿企业；同时，国家也要求原有的工业、小型工业和手工业努力增产积累资金，以便更好地支援农业生产特别是工业的基本建设任务，按照计划规定今年工业总产值要比去年增加517％。完成了这个指标，就可以使越南北方工业产量达到战前1939年最高的水平。
    越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府积极医治战争创伤、在恢复国民经济时期着手建立国家工业基础的主张，得到越南人民衷心的拥护和支持，解放了的工人阶级更以实际行动来体现党和政府的要求，许多过去做不到的事情现在都做了。按照过去法国殖民者的计算，要修复鸿基煤矿4公里长的吊车运输系统最少需要三个半月，可是解放后越南工人只用20天的功夫就全部修理好了。海防水泥厂、南定纺织厂等重要企业单位的修复工作，也都比预定计划提前完成了。南定纺织厂在复工期间，工人和职员们自动发起“工具回厂运动”，他们把过去殖民者统治时期偷藏到各人家里的工具、化验仪器乃至医院里的显微镜，都送回工厂里来，解决了工厂在修复过程中的许多困难。
    由于工人生产积极性的高涨，各个工矿企业的生产也都飞快地增长起来，许多过去的殖民地式的“定额”都纷纷地被突破了。河内嘉林火车修理厂，殖民地时代一年只能大修一台机车，可是越南职工在去年一年里就大修了12台机车；修造一个车厢过去需用550个工，现在只需155个工；过去每人日产螺丝钉300个，现在日产1，400个。南定丝绸厂机织的化学丝绸，过去每台机日产9公尺，现在日产14公尺，最高达到19公尺。南定纺织厂机织30支纱黑细布，过去每机每班产9公尺，现在产15公尺，最高的达到19以至20公尺。工人们并不满足于单纯提高产量，他们还积极想法节约原料降低成本。据越南总工会初步统计，从去年1月到9月，越南北方各地工人共提出6，000件合理化建议，使国家节省了数十亿元越币。许多工矿企业工人并自动展开“捡废料运动”，使国家增加许多收入，鸿基煤矿筑桥处职工一个星期日捡得碎煤34吨，仓库职工捡得废铜烂铁2万斤。一个老工人说：“过去谁想替工厂捡这些东西？做多少算多少。现在看到这些东西丢在这里没人管心里就难受，想到这是我们国家的财产，自己的手就不由得动起来了。”
    “我们的机器！”“我们的工厂！”“我们的企业！”在越南北方，现在不管你到原有的工厂、矿山或者是到新的基本建设工地上去，常常都可以听到或者看到这些充满着自豪感的语句。越南人民是应当感到自豪的，他们不仅从殖民者手里取回了自己的工厂矿山，而且已经开始有计划有步骤地建设自己的工矿企业了。不久，在越南北方将要出现一个个从来没有过的新城市，这按照国家计划在1956年和1957年建成的新工矿企业，是越南人民走向工业化、走向繁荣和富强途程上第一块里程碑。
