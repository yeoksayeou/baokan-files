(I) To the Editor:
    The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for the years 1956 to 1967, has filled all of our agricultural cooperative members with excitement and joy. Everyone said: Chairman Mao has thought of everything for us, and these 40 articles are all in line with our wishes; we guarantee to complete this program ahead of schedule and above the quota.
    Our guarantee is fully justified. Last November, our cooperative was upgraded from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative, and the number of members gradually increased from the original 180 households to more than 1,000 households. To follow the path of socialism, many members dug up the boundary stones they had treasured for generations and leveled the field ridges. The high tide of cooperation made the members full of enthusiasm for production. In the freezing cold, even white-haired old women and children in their teens rushed to the fields to work. Black fertile mud piled up in the fields, and ditching and road construction were in full swing; this was something that had never happened before. Not long ago, our cooperative formulated a production plan for 1956, requiring an average yield of 120 jin of ginned cotton per mu. However, after implementing the system of contracting work and output, some members proposed an average yield of 161 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 83.1% over 1955. This means that our cotton production this year will exceed the target required by the program to be achieved in 12 years.
    After reading the program, the 43 main cadres of our cooperative repeatedly studied it and revised our cooperative's long-term agricultural development plan based on this program. The National Agricultural Development Program broadened our horizons and made us see the enormous potential for increased agricultural production. We believe that with the development of socialist industrialization, as long as we give full play to the superiority of being organized, we can achieve this production increase target. The completion of the entire plan will undoubtedly greatly improve our material and cultural living standards.
    According to our production plan for this year, in addition to the labor force required for agricultural production, the entire cooperative can have an additional 400 laborers throughout the year. We originally planned to organize this group of laborers to engage in sideline production, but now we have decided to vigorously develop land reclamation work. According to accurate calculations, we can reclaim more than 500 mu of wasteland this year by leveling mounds on the land, closing and filling dead water rivers, and other methods, which is estimated to increase grain production by more than 200,000 jin. Currently, more than 1,000 people are working by the river to collect mud and fill land, with the goal of turning more than 1 million dan of fertile mud from the river onto the land. In addition, we have sent out two reclamation teams to establish new villages in nearby Macheng and Zhangdu Lake, which are expected to reclaim more than 1,600 mu of wasteland in total. We strive to complete all these tasks before the Spring Festival.

(II) To the Editor:
    The promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) has inspired the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. According to the spirit and production targets of the program, the Party branches and agricultural production cooperatives in many townships in Xiayi County, Henan Province, have revised their original plans and raised the agricultural production targets for 1956. For example, the Jinshan Agricultural Cooperative in Wangji Township originally did not plan to topdress more than 600 mu of wheat, but now it has been decided that each mu will be topdressed with one cart of fertilizer; the original plan was to apply only 2.5 carts of fertilizer per mu to autumn crops, but now it has been decided to increase this to 4 carts, so that the yield can be increased from an average of 290 jin per mu to 340 jin. At present, the members are carrying out labor competitions and actively developing fertilizer sources. After studying the program, the peasants in Zhu Zhuang Township rose up in groups before dawn to dig pit mud for fertilizer accumulation. According to incomplete statistics from this township, more than 3,500 carts of pit mud were dug out in 5 days. After the peasants in Cao Zhuang Township organized the study of the program, Zhu Canzhang and other members of 17 agricultural cooperatives voluntarily increased their investment in the cooperatives by 12,560 yuan, preparing to buy 50 horses and 40 double-wheeled plows.
    In order to enable various crops to develop appropriately according to local conditions, the Hongqi, Wuxing, Liming and other 5 advanced cooperatives have recently made a comprehensive plan for land utilization, dividing the areas into grain production areas and cotton production areas. These cooperatives are preparing to dig 17 drainage ditches in 1957, which can prevent more than 35,000 mu of low-lying land from flooding; they also plan to dig 143 wells before the spring plowing this year, which can prevent more than 9,000 mu of land from reducing production due to drought.

### 为实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗

    为实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗		（一）编辑同志：
    中共中央政治局提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）传到了我们农业社以后，全体社员都抑制不住内心的激动和喜悦。大家说：毛主席什么都替我们想到了，这40条条条合乎我们的心意；我们保证要提前和超额完成这个纲要。
    我们的保证是完全有根据的。去年11月间，我们社由初级社升为高级社，社员由原来的180户逐渐增加到1，000多户。许多社员为了走社会主义的道路，把世世代代视若珍宝的界石挖掉了，把田埂扒平了。合作化的高潮使社员们生产劲头十足。在冰天雪地里，连白发的老太婆和十来岁的小孩子也都抢先下地生产。乌黑的肥泥堆满了田畈，开沟筑路搞得热火朝天，这真是从来也没有过的事情。不久以前，我们社里订出了1956年生产规划，要求每亩地平均产皮棉120斤。但是在实行包工包产以后，有些社员提出每亩平均要产161斤皮棉，比1955年每亩增产83．1％。这就是说，我们今年棉花的产量，将超过纲要要求在12年内达到的指标。
    看到了纲要以后，我们社里43个主要干部进行了反复的学习，并根据这个纲要重新修订了我们社农业发展的远景规划。全国农业发展纲要扩大了我们的眼界，使我们看到了农业增产上存在着的巨大的潜力。我们相信，随着社会主义工业化的发展，只要我们充分发挥组织起来的优越性，是可以达到这个增产指标的。整个规划的完成，无疑将使我们的物质生活和文化生活的水平得到很大的提高。
    根据我们今年的生产规划，除了农业生产所需要的劳动力以外，全社整年还可以多出400个劳动力。我们原先打算组织这批劳动力搞副业生产，现在决定大力开展恳荒地的工作。根据确实的计算，我们用铲平土地上的土墩、闭塞和填平死水河等办法，今年可以开出荒地500多亩，估计可以增产粮食20万斤以上。目前已经有1，000多人正在河边进行取泥和填土工作，要把河里的100多万担肥泥都翻到地面上来。另外，我们还派出了两个恳荒队，分别到附近的麻城和涨渡湖去建立新村，预计一共能够开出荒地1，600多亩。这些工作，我们争取要在春节以前全部完成。

            （二）编辑同志：
    全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布以后，鼓舞了广大农民的生产积极性。根据纲要的精神和生产指标，我们河南省夏邑县很多乡的党支部和农业生产合作社重新修改了本乡本社的原订计划，提高了1956 年的农业生产指标。例如，王集乡金山农业社，原来有600多亩小麦不准备追肥，现在决定每亩都要追肥一车；原计划大秋作物每亩只施肥2车半，现在决定提高到4车，这样产量就可以由平均每亩290斤提高到340斤。目前，社员们正开展了劳动竞赛，积极开辟肥源。祝庄乡农民学习了纲要以后，天不明就有成群结队的人起来扒坑泥积肥。据这个乡不完全的统计，在5天内扒出坑泥3，500多车。曹庄乡组织农民学习了纲要以后，朱灿章等17个农业社的社员自动向社内增加投资12，560元，准备买马50匹，双铧犁40部。
    为了使各种农作物能够因地制宜地得到应有的发展，最近红旗、五星、黎明等5个高级社已经对土地的利用作了全面规划，划分了粮食产区和棉花产区。这些社准备在1957年内挖排水沟17条，可以使35，000多亩凹地不再积水成灾；还计划在今年春耕前打井143眼，可以使9，000多亩田不致因为受旱灾而减产。
