Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: The National Congress of Young Activists from Industry and Commerce opened in Beijing this afternoon.

The congress venue was the auditorium of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. A large red banner hung in the hall, with the slogan: "Aspire to be a Glorious Worker, Dedicate Youth to the Great Socialist Construction."

A total of 809 young activists from industry and commerce are participating in this congress, including representative advanced elements among young capitalists from industry and commerce, advanced elements among the children of capitalists employed in private industrial and commercial enterprises, and young people among the children of capitalists who are not in school but have no occupation and have actively performed in social work. Many of them have emerged during the high tide of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

At 2:30 PM, after passing the presidium of the congress consisting of 64 people including Liao Chengzhi and Hu Yaobang, Hu Yaobang delivered an opening speech on behalf of the All-China Youth Federation and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League. Hu Yaobang first expressed a warm welcome to the young activists from industry and commerce for their good performance in accepting socialist transformation. He said that although the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country has achieved a decisive victory, significant efforts are still needed to transform all capitalist enterprises in our country into completely socialist enterprises, and to transform all industrialists and businessmen in the country into self-reliant laborers. In this situation, how should the young people in industry and commerce throughout the country further raise their awareness, how should they advance with the motherland and make contributions to socialism, we think this is the issue that you are most concerned about. Our congress is precisely to solve these problems, and we hope that you will seriously discuss these issues at the meeting. He finally wished that the young activists attending the congress would make more outstanding contributions to the motherland after this meeting.

Subsequently, Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, delivered speeches at the meeting. In his speech, Huang Yanpei hoped that young activists from industry and commerce would work hard in production and strengthen ideological remoulding in the future socialist transformation. He hoped that young activists from industry and commerce would be "three-good" children of the Mao Zedong era and strive to complete "the extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done." Chen Shutong said at the meeting that our industrialists and businessmen have high demands and expectations for young activists from industry and commerce. You must be diligent and honest, guard against any exaggeration and pride, study tenaciously, work tirelessly, and further strive for self-transformation. Their speeches were warmly welcomed.

Liao Chengzhi, on behalf of the All-China Youth Federation and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, delivered a report to the congress entitled "Advance with the Motherland, Make Contributions to Socialism!" In his report, he put forward three tasks for the young activists from industry and commerce attending the meeting and the young people from industry and commerce throughout the country: First, actively participate in the transformation after the joint state-private ownership of enterprises, improve business management, and strive to develop production. For those who have not yet cleared their assets and verified capital, actively and realistically do a good job in clearing assets and verifying capital. Second, work honestly, firmly establish the view of loving labor, and constantly learn and improve their labor skills. Third, actively participate in political study, transform their thinking, and raise socialist awareness.

During Liao Chengzhi's report, sustained applause resounded throughout the venue. (Attached picture)

    全国工商界青年积极分子大会在京开幕
    新华社22日讯　全国工商界青年积极分子大会今天下午在北京开幕。
    大会会场设在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会大礼堂。会场上横挂着大幅红布标语，上面的口号是：“立志做一个光荣的劳动者，把青春献给伟大的社会主义建设事业。”
    参加这次大会的工商界的青年积极分子共有809人，其中有工商界青年资本家中有代表性的先进分子，有在私营工商企业中供职的资本家子女中的先进分子，有不在学校读书但又没有职业的资本家子女中参加社会工作有积极表现的青年。他们有许多人是在这次资本主义工商业的社会主义改造高潮中涌现出来的。
    下午2时半，会议在通过了廖承志、胡耀邦等64人为大会主席团以后，由胡耀邦代表中华全国民主青年联合会和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会致开幕词。胡耀邦首先对工商界青年积极分子在接受社会主义改造中的良好表现，表示热烈的欢迎。他说，我国资本主义工商业的社会主义的改造虽然已经取得了决定性的胜利，但是要把我国所有的资本主义企业改造成为完全的社会主义企业，要使全国所有的工商业者改造成为自食其力的劳动者，还需要作重大的努力。在这种情形下，全国工商界青年应该如何进一步地提高自己的觉悟，应该如何跟祖国一道前进，为社会主义立功，我们想，这是你们最关心的问题。我们的大会正是要解决这些问题，希望你们在会上对这些问题认真地讨论。他最后预祝到会的青年积极分子，在这次大会以后，能为祖国作出更出色的贡献。
    接着，中国民主建国会中央委员会主任委员黄炎培和中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通在会上致词。黄炎培在讲话中希望工商界青年积极分子在今后的社会主义改造中，努力生产，加强思想改造。他希望工商界青年积极分子做一个毛泽东时代的“三好”的儿女，为完成“我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”而奋斗。陈叔通在会上说，我们工商业者对于工商界青年积极分子的要求和期望是很高的。你们一定要勤勤恳恳，老老实实，力戒任何浮夸和骄傲，顽强地学习，不懈地工作，进一步努力自我改造。他们的致词，受到了热烈欢迎。
    廖承志代表中华全国民主青年联合会和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会向大会作“跟祖国一道前进，为社会主义立功！”的报告。他在报告中向到会的工商界青年积极分子和全国工商界青年提出了三项任务：一、要积极参加企业合营以后的改造，改进经营管理，努力发展生产，还没有清产核资的，要积极地、实事求是地做好清产核资工作。二、诚实地劳动，巩固地树立热爱劳动的观点，不断地学习和提高自己的劳动技能。三、积极参加政治学习，改造思想，提高社会主义觉悟。
    在廖承志报告的时候，全场不断地响起了经久不息的掌声。（附图片）
