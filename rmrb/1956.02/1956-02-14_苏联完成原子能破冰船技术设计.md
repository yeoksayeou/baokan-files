    Moscow dispatch from our newspaper on the 13th. The "Pravda" published an article on the 12th saying that Soviet scientists and shipbuilding designers have produced a technical design for a nuclear-powered icebreaker for use in the Arctic. A Soviet shipyard is now preparing to manufacture the first one. "Pravda" also published a photo of a model of this icebreaker with a nuclear engine.
    Pravda said that a nuclear-powered icebreaker can travel nine to eleven times farther and have half again as much horsepower as an ordinary coal- or oil-fired icebreaker. 30% of an ordinary icebreaker’s displacement is used to carry thousands of tons of fuel, consuming hundreds of tons of coal per day, so it is impossible to be away from the seaport for too long. A nuclear-powered icebreaker consumes only a few centimeters of uranium per day, so its range is virtually unlimited. Designers are using the displacement that the icebreaker would normally use to store fuel to increase the horsepower of the nuclear engine and strengthen the hull. This type of icebreaker can open up routes in the Arctic that ordinary icebreakers cannot.
    This novel icebreaker will have a main engine with 44,000 horsepower and a displacement of 16,000 tons. The supplies on board are enough to last it for a year without having to return to port. The ship is fully equipped for work and recreation. The crew lives in single and double cabins, and the ship's air and light are very good. There are halls, living rooms, clubs, movie theaters, reading rooms, and modern medical clinics.
    Personnel on board are insured against the threat of radioactive radiation generated by the nuclear engine because it is operated remotely with automated equipment.
    This type of icebreaker can navigate in the most difficult conditions in the Arctic, with its highly complex climate, in fog and snow, and in the dim Arctic night. The ship will be equipped with modern navigation and radio detection equipment to ensure safe navigation and communication with the convoys it leads. Two ice-reconnaissance helicopters will be stationed on the icebreaker. The driving of the ship is highly automated.

    苏联完成原子能破冰船技术设计
    本报莫斯科13日专电　“真理报”12日发表的一篇文章说，苏联科学家和造船设计师已经制出在北极用的装备有原子发动机的破冰船的技术设计，苏联一个造船厂现在准备制造第一艘。“真理报”并且登载了这种带原子发动机的破冰船的模型的照片。
    真理报说，使用原子能的破冰船比较普通烧煤或烧石油的破冰船，在航程上可以远九倍到十一倍，马力大半倍。普通破冰船的30％的排水量用以装载几千吨燃料，一昼夜耗煤百吨，所以不可能离开海港太久。带原子发动机的破冰船一昼夜耗铀不过若干公分，所以它的航行范围事实上是无限的。设计师们利用破冰船贮藏燃料那部分排水量来提高原子发动机的马力和加固船身。这种破冰船能够在北极开辟普通破冰船开辟不了的航线。
    这种新颖的破冰船将拥有44，000匹马力的主要发动机，排水量为16，000吨。船上的贮备够它用一年不必回海港。船上劳动和文娱的设备齐全。船员住的单人和双人舱、船的空气和光线都很好。船上有大厅、客厅、俱乐部、电影室、阅览室和现代化的医务所。
    船上人员保险不受原子发动机产生的放射性幅射的威胁，因为它是用自动化设备远距离操纵的。
    这种破冰船能够在气候非常复杂的北极的最困难条件下，在起雾和下雪中，在昏暗的北极夜里航行。船上将装置现代化的航海和无线电探测的设备，它们保证航行的安全和同所带领的船队的联络。破冰船上将停泊两架探索冰向的直升飞机。船的驾驶是高度自动化的。
