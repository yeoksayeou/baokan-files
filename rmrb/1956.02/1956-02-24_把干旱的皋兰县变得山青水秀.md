Turning the Arid Gaolan County into a Land of Green Mountains and Clear Waters
Sun Zhaojia, Deputy County Head of Gaolan County, Gansu Province

Gaolan County is located in central Gansu Province and is divided into northern and southern parts by the Yellow River. Except for small plains along the Yellow River, the entire county is comprised of hills and mountains. The total area of the county is 5,000 square kilometers, with 1.16 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for 15.46% of the total area. Currently, there are 76,745 mu of irrigated land, accounting for 6.6% of the cultivated land area. The county has a population of over 210,000, with an average of just over 3 fen of irrigated land per person. The annual rainfall is 250 millimeters, mostly concentrated in the autumn. The climate is dry and cold, with a long frost period, and crops are harvested only once a year. The area north of the Yellow River, accounting for 57% of the county's total area, has no trees on the mountains and no grass on the ground. Dry gullies and barren ridges are everywhere, and both humans and animals have difficulty obtaining drinking water. According to county records, from 1850 to 1950, various disasters occurred 52 times, including 30 droughts. In years of drought, the masses had no choice but to beg for food or flee. The great drought of 1929 saw the largest number of people fleeing, with the saying "nine out of ten houses empty." From 1952 to 1954, the county suffered three consecutive years of drought. Although the People's Government allocated large amounts of relief funds, more than 8,000 people still fled to Lanzhou in the late spring and early summer of 1953.

The farmers of Gaolan County have also gained considerable experience in the fight against drought. They have built mountain flood irrigation projects, laid sand fields, and constructed ponds and water cellars everywhere. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the masses of farmers throughout the county have more widely carried out water conservancy construction work.

In the past, no wells had ever been dug in the area north of the Yellow River in Gaolan County. In 1953, the Weixianshi mutual aid team in Zhuangziping, north of the Yellow River, dug a well, installed a waterwheel, and lifted water for irrigation. This event caused a sensation throughout the drought-stricken area north of the Yellow River. At that time, the county Party committee organized the masses to visit Zhuangziping and convened a meeting of district Party committee secretaries on the spot to summarize the well-digging experience of the Weixianshi mutual aid team, discuss various drought resistance methods, and specifically assign water conservancy construction tasks. After returning, they held various types of water conservancy demonstration projects in each district and organized the masses to observe; the townships also held similar demonstration projects. Through level-by-level demonstrations, summarizing and promoting the experience of the masses, a mass movement to find water sources was widely launched throughout the county, and various types of water conservancy projects were built in accordance with local conditions. In this way, 15 villages in the county have an average of more than one mu of irrigated land per person, more than 70 villages have completely solved the problem of drinking water for humans and animals, and more than 100 villages have laid a preliminary foundation for changing the face of drought.

The following are a few experiences of Gaolan County in its fight against drought:

First, measures such as lining the canals with red clay and pebbles to prevent leakage and digging reservoirs for "small accumulation and large release" (first accumulating small streams into reservoirs near the water source, and then using a large flow to irrigate the land after they are full, which can reduce losses such as canal seepage and evaporation) have greatly saved water. For example, Liantagou is a historically arid plain in Gaolan County. In the past, the drinking water for humans and animals on the plain depended entirely on the small stream in Majiasi Gou, 10 li away, which had a very small flow. However, the seepage in the river was very large, and the five days and nights of water flow distributed each month were not enough for 84 households to drink for a week. By adopting the "small accumulation and large release" method, two ponds were filled in just one day and night, which could supply the entire village with drinking water for humans and animals for two months.

Second, different water lifting tools and methods are adopted according to the depth of the groundwater. In areas with very shallow groundwater, interception ditches are dug for self-flowing irrigation. In areas with deeper groundwater, wells are dug and waterwheels are installed. If the well is seven or eight zhang deep and one waterwheel is not enough, two or three waterwheels are installed continuously on one well to lift water in stages. If the well is twelve or thirteen zhang deep, a windlass sheepskin bag is used to lift water, and the lifted water is first stored in a small pool and then released for irrigation. For example, Qinwangchuan used these methods to expand the irrigated area by 470 mu.

Third, water cellars and ponds are dug to store rainwater, ice is stored to conserve water, and flood ditches are built extensively to develop flood irrigation in a controlled manner. Mountain floods are fertile, and irrigation after flooding can both conserve moisture and increase soil fertility. However, it is difficult to achieve timely flood irrigation. In order to solve this problem, the farmers of Gaolan County adopted the method of digging ponds on flat land to collect and store floodwater, or moving ice to the ponds in winter to accumulate water. The seepage in the ponds dug on loose loess layers is very large, so a layer of red clay is filled in the bottom of the pond to prevent seepage. In order to prevent water evaporation, the water is stored in cellars with small mouths and large bellies built with rammed red clay, which are used to supply water for irrigation and drinking for humans and animals.

Fourth, laying sand to cover the land can alleviate drought and ensure increased production. Sand fields can conserve moisture, retain soil temperature, suppress alkali, and save water during irrigation. In the past three years, the masses throughout the county have laid new sand and replaced old sand on 100,000 mu.

Now, according to the new situation of the development of agricultural cooperativization, Gaolan County requires that the water conservancy plan, which was originally planned to basically eliminate the threat of ordinary drought within seven years, be completed in four years from 1956 to 1959. After the implementation of this plan, the county will have an average of 1.02 mu of irrigated land per person. Calculated at a minimum yield of 550 jin per mu, the harvest from irrigated land alone will be 561 jin of grain per person per year. The specific content of this plan is as follows:

1.  Area North of the Yellow River: In the Zhuangziping, Changchuan, Shuifuhe, and Beishan areas, where the groundwater is about seven to eight zhang deep, 490 liberation-style waterwheels will be installed to irrigate 7,350 mu of land. On the large plains of Qinwangchuan and Gongbachuan, about 120 li long and 10 li wide, 100 water pumps will be installed in areas with abundant water sources to irrigate 80,000 mu of land. In the Heishichuan, Heshangbao, Beishan, and Dongxu areas, where the groundwater is more than 20 zhang deep, 10,062 water cellars and 824 ponds will be dug to store rainwater and ice, and to solve the problem of drinking water for all humans and animals, in addition to irrigating 7,116 mu of land. The total area of irrigated land will be 94,466 mu. Adding the existing 30,000 mu of irrigated land, the total irrigated land will be 124,466 mu. This area has an agricultural population of 72,630 people, with an average of 1.7 mu of irrigated land per person. In addition, land ridges will be cultivated, interception ditches will be dug, flood irrigation will be developed on 240,000 mu, and sand fields will be laid on 118,000 mu.

2.  Area South of the Yellow River: On the banks of the Yellow River and along some streams, 28 water pumps will be installed to irrigate 23,400 mu of land. In Yinshan, Huanghui, Chengjing, Majiasi and other places with surface water sources, 24 small canals will be built to irrigate 11,000 mu of land. Old canals will be renovated to strengthen irrigation management and expand the irrigated area by 14,340 mu. 200 water storage ponds will be dug to irrigate 800 mu of land. The total area of irrigated land will be 49,540 mu. Adding the existing 43,345 mu of irrigated land, the total irrigated land will be 92,885 mu. This area has an agricultural population of 138,000 people, with an average of just over 0.6 mu of irrigated land per person.

3.  Soil and Water Conservation Work: 200,000 mu of land ridges will be cultivated, 200,000 mu of terraced fields will be built, 191,800 water scoop structures will be built, 31,500 mu of ridge farming areas will be established, 27,000 mu of horizontal field ditches will be dug, 2,433 dams will be built, 870 flood prevention ponds will be built, and 3,380 mu of river beach will be silted. After completing the above tasks, 90% of the county's soil erosion area can be controlled. In addition, it is also required to afforest 1.3 million mu, cultivate 116,750 mu of seedlings, and plant 490,000 mu of alfalfa. In this way, Gaolan County will have forests on every mountain, trees in every village, and pastures in every commune, turning an arid area into a land of green mountains and clear waters, with abundant food and clothing.

    把干旱的皋兰县变得山青水秀
    甘肃省皋兰县副县长  孙兆甲
    皋兰县在甘肃省中部，被黄河划为南北两部分，除黄河沿岸有小片平原外，全是丘陵山区。全县总面积5，000平方公里，耕地116万亩，占总面积15.46％。现有水浇地76，745亩，占耕地面积6.6％，居民21万多人，平均每人有水浇地3分多。年雨量250公厘，多集中在秋季，气候干燥寒冷，霜期很长，庄稼一年只收一季。占全县总面积57％的黄河以北地区，山上无树，地面无草，到处是干沟枯岭，人畜饮水都很困难。据县志记载，自1850年至1950年的100年中，曾发生各种灾害52次，其中即有旱灾30次。群众遇到缺雨年份，除乞讨逃荒外，再无别路可走。1929年大旱，向外逃荒人数最多，有“十室九空”之说。1952年至1954年连遭3年干旱，人民政府虽然大量拨款救济，在1953年春末夏初仍有8，000多人到兰州逃荒。
    皋兰县的农民在抗旱斗争中也得到了不少经验。他们兴修的山洪漫地工程，铺砂田，涝池水窖等到处都有。解放以来，在党的领导下，全县农民群众更普遍地开展了水利建设工作。
    皋兰县黄河北岸地区过去从没有打过井。1953年黄河北岸庄子坪未先仕互助组打了一眼井，安了一部水车，提水浇地。这件事情传出后，轰动了整个黄河北岸干旱地区。当时县委便组织群众到庄子坪参观，并就地召集了区委书记会议，总结了未先仕互助组的打井经验，讨论了各种抗旱的办法，具体交代了水利建设任务。他们回去后，在各区举办了不同类型的水利示范工程，组织群众观摩；各乡也同样举办了这种示范工程。经过逐级示范，总结和推广群众经验，全县便广泛地展开了找水源的群众运动，因地制宜地兴修了多种多样的水利工程。这样全县有15个村每人平均有水浇地一亩以上，70多个村全部解决了人畜饮水问题，100多个村初步奠定了改变干旱面貌的基础。
    皋兰县向干旱作斗争的几点经验：
    一、采取在渠道内用红胶泥和卵石衬砌防漏及挖蓄水池“小聚大放”（先把小流水聚到距水源近的蓄水池内，等聚满后，用大流量浇地，这样可以减少渠道渗漏蒸发等损失）的办法，大大节省了水量。如连塔沟是皋兰县历史上的一个干旱平原，原上人畜饮水全靠10里外的麻家寺沟流量很小的小溪供给，但是河沟渗漏很大，每月分得五昼夜的水流到原上不够84户一周的饮水。采用“小聚大放”的办法，只一昼夜就蓄满了两个涝池，可供全村人畜两个月的饮水。
    二、根据地下水的深浅，采用不同的提水工具和提水办法。地下水很浅的地区挖截水沟自流浇地。地下水较深的地区打井安水车。水井深在七、八丈以上的，一部水车力量不够，就在一眼井上连续安装两部或三部水车，分级提水。水井深在十二、三丈以上的就用辘轳羊皮袋吊水，把提出的水先蓄在小池内，再集中放出浇地。如秦王川利用这些办法扩大了灌溉面积470亩。
    三、打水窖挖涝池蓄积雨水，养冰保水，普遍地修建洪水沟，有控制地发展引洪漫地。山洪水肥，漫灌后既能保墒又能增加地力。但是洪水漫地很难做到适时。为了解决这个问题，皋兰县的农民便采用平地挖涝池的办法引蓄洪水，或在冬天把冰搬在池内积水。在疏松的黄土层上挖的涝池渗漏很大，就在池底分填一层红胶泥防止渗漏。为了防止水分蒸发，便把水拦蓄在用红胶泥夯打好的口小腹大的窖内，供给浇地用水和人畜饮用。
    四、铺砂压地能够减轻旱象，保证增产。铺砂田能保墒、保地温、压碱，灌溉的时候又节省水。三年来全县群众铺新砂、换老砂达10万亩。
    现在，皋兰县根据农业合作化发展的新情况，要求原计划在七年内基本上消除普通干旱威胁的水利规划提前在1956年到1959年四年内完成。实现这个规划后，全县每人平均将有水浇地一亩零二厘，以每亩最低产量550斤计，只水浇地收成每年每人有粮食561斤。这个规划的具体内容如下：
    一、黄河北岸地区：在地下水深约七丈至八丈间的庄子平、长川、水阜河、北山地区，安装解放式水车490部，浇地7，350亩。在秦王川、龚巴川长约120华里宽10华里的大平原上，选择水源丰富的地区，安装抽水机100台，浇地8万亩。在地下水深20丈以上的黑石川、和尚堡、北山、董许地区打水窖10，062个，挖涝池824个，蓄积雨水，养冰蓄水，除解决全部人畜饮水问题外，可浇地7，116亩。以上总共可浇地94，466亩，加上现有水浇地3万亩，共计有水浇地124，466亩，本地区有农业人口72，630人，平均每人有水浇地一亩七分。另外开展培地埂，挖截水沟，发展洪水漫地24万亩，铺砂田118，000亩。
    二、黄河以南地区：在黄河沿岸和一些溪流的两岸安装抽水机28台，浇地23，400亩。在有地上水源的银山、湟惠、城井、麻家寺等地，修小型渠道24条，浇地11，000亩。整修旧渠加强灌溉管理，扩大灌溉面积14，340亩。打蓄水涝池200个，浇地800亩。以上总共可浇地49，540亩，加上现有水浇地43，345亩，共计有水浇地92，885亩，本地区有农业人口138，000人，平均每人有水浇地六分多。
      三、水土保持工作：培地埂20万亩，修梯田20万亩，修水簸箕191，800个，垅作区田31，500亩，挖田间水平沟27，000亩，打坝2，433座，修防洪涝池870个，河滩淤地3，380亩。完成上述任务后，就可控制全县水土流失面积的90％。另外还要求造林130万亩，育苗116，750亩，种苜蓿49万亩。这样，皋兰县就山山有林，村村有树，社社有草园，把一个干旱地区变成山青水秀，丰衣足食的地区。
