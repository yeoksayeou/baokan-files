    Large Numbers of Construction Workers Exceed Quotas
    In the three major construction units of Chongqing First Construction Engineering Company, Second Construction Engineering Company, and Southwest Fourth Engineering Company, more than 80% of the workers have met or exceeded their quotas. Many engineering units have seen advanced producers who are actively improving operations and tools, and greatly exceeding the national unified quota.
    After Chongqing Third Construction Engineering Company's young worker Yang Changshi created two new bricklaying methods, the "single-person mortar spreader" and the "mobile elevation line," and exceeded the national unified quota for laying 250mm walls by one and a half times, he recently created a mortar spreader for laying 380mm walls and improved the method of operating for laying stepped walls. After adopting this new operation method, the efficiency of laying bricks for stepped walls can be increased from 1,300 bricks per person per day to 2,000 bricks, exceeding the quota by more than 53%. Yang Changshi's younger brother, Yang Changbin, recently proposed two suggestions: using a brick-bucket mortar spreader and using a bamboo brush instead of an iron sheet to sweep the seams. Replacing the original manual mortar application with a brick-bucket mortar spreader allows the efficiency of laying bricks for hollow walls to exceed the national unified quota by 1.26 times. Worker Deng Jixing, with the help of Yang Changbin, created a 130mm wall mortar spreader, allowing the efficiency of laying bricks for 130mm walls to exceed the national unified quota by one and a half times. Wang Changyin, a worker at the First Construction Engineering Company, researched and improved a millstone machine for grinding lime-sand-clay mixtures, increasing the efficiency of grinding lime-sand-clay mixtures by ten times compared to the previous manual grinding.
    This year, Chongqing's construction engineering tasks have increased by more than double compared to last year. Construction workers are constantly improving their work efficiency in an effort to complete the construction tasks ahead of schedule.

    大批建筑工人突破定额
    在重庆市第一建筑工程公司、第二建筑工程公司、西南第四工程公司三个主要建筑单位中，有80％以上的工人已经达到或突破了定额。不少工程单位出现了积极改进操作和工具、大大突破全国统一定额的先进生产者。
    重庆市第三建筑工程公司青年工人杨长诗创造了“单人铺灰器”和“活动升线”两项新砌砖法，突破砌二五墙的全国统一定额一倍半以后，最近又创造了砌三八墙的铺灰器和改进了砌磴子墙的操作法。这种新操作法采用以后，磴子墙的砌砖效率可由每人每天砌1，300块提高到2，000块，突破定额53％以上。杨长诗的弟弟杨长斌，最近提出了采用斗砖铺灰器和用竹刷代替铁片扫缝的两项建议。用斗砖铺灰器代替原来的人工抹灰以后，使空斗墙的砌砖效率突破全国统一定额一点二六倍。工人邓吉星在杨长斌的帮助下，创造了一三墙铺灰器，使一三墙的砌砖效率突破全国统一定额一倍半以上。第一建筑工程公司工人王长银研究改进了一种磨三合土的磨石机，使磨三合土的效率比以前用人工来磨提高了十倍。
    今年重庆市的建筑工程任务比去年增加一倍多。建筑工人正不断提高工作效率，争取提前完成建设任务。
