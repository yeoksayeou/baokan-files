    中华全国总工会选拔
    参加中苏联合登山活动的运动员
    为了迎接今年夏天在中国举行的中苏运动员的联合登山活动，中华全国总工会目前已经开始进行运动员选拔和物资筹备等准备工作。这次的联合登山活动是由中华全国总工会和全苏工会中央理事会联合举办的。
    中苏双方将各有12名运动员参加这次登山活动。中国方面的运动员将从各产业系统的工人中来选拔。他们在这次活动举行以前，将先经过身体的全面锻炼，学习登山的知识和技术，以及经过实际的登山练习。
    中苏两国的登山运动员今年将联合攀登新疆维吾尔自治区西部的慕士塔格峰（海拔7，546公尺）和公格尔峰（海拔7，719公尺）。中苏两国的登山运动员去年8月间曾经联合攀登过苏联境内的十月峰（海拔6，780公尺）和中苏运动员共同命名的团结峰（海拔6，773公尺）。
