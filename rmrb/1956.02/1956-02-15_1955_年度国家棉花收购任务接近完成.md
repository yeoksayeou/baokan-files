    The national cotton procurement task for 1955 (September 1955 – August 1956) is nearing completion. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement, as of the end of January, the total national cotton procurement reached 22.9 million dan, accounting for 95.14% of the revised procurement plan of 24.07 million dan, an increase of 71% compared to the same period last year. At the current procurement rate, cotton procurement in most cotton-producing areas will be completed ahead of schedule and in excess of the plan. Among them, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan, Sichuan, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing and other 9 provinces and cities have exceeded the plan by about 10%, and other major producing areas have generally completed about 90% of the plan. It is estimated that the national cotton procurement plan will be fully completed by the end of March.
    In order to support the country's socialist construction, many cotton farmers in various places have enthusiastically sold all their cotton except for the necessary self-retained cotton to the state. All cotton farmers who have overfulfilled the cotton pre-purchase tasks have received the state-issued preferential supply material vouchers (cloth coupons, food coupons).
    Because all localities have paid attention to implementing the "premium price for premium cotton" policy in the procurement work, the quality of cotton purchased this year is also very good.

    1955年度国家棉花收购任务接近完成
    1955年度（1955年9月—1956年8月）的国家棉花收购任务已经接近完成。据农产品采购部统计，到1月底为止，全国棉花收购总量达到2，290万担，占经过修订的、收购计划2，407万担的95.14％，比去年同期收购量增加了71％。按目前收购进度来看，大部棉产区的棉花收购工作都将提前和超额完成。其中，浙江、江苏、安徽、山东、湖南、四川、上海、天津、北京等9个省市都已经超额10％左右，其他主要产区一般也都完成了90％左右。估计到3月底全国棉花收购计划将全部完成。
    各地许多棉农为支援国家社会主义建设，都踊跃地将必要的自留棉以外的全部棉花卖给了国家。所有超额完成棉花预购任务的棉农都得到了国家发给的优待供应实物凭证（布票、粮票）。
    由于各地在收购工作中注意执行了“优棉优价”的政策，本年度收购的棉花的质量也很好。
