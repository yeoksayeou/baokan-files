Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 12th: Indian newspapers, commenting on the results of the negotiations regarding the political status of Malaya, which were announced in London on February 8th, focused on criticizing the arrangement whereby British troops would remain stationed in Malaya after the Federation of Malaya achieved full self-government and independence. The "Hindustan Standard" said on the 10th: The presence of British troops in Malaya is "very repugnant to Asian sentiment."

The "National Herald" of the 9th said that with these conditions, "Malaya's independence is being curtailed." The newspaper supported the position expressed by the Malayan Communist Party in its declaration, saying, "The Communist Party is right to reject the presence of British troops in an independent Malaya, and it will garner much support."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from London: British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd and Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Rahman, signed a report in London on February 8th regarding the negotiations on the political status of Malaya. The report stated that Britain agreed to the demands of the Federation of Malaya delegation: "The Federation of Malaya should be declared fully self-governing and independent within the Commonwealth before August 1957, if possible."

The report stated that during the "transition period" before the Federation of Malaya achieves full self-government and independence, Malaya's internal defense and security will be the responsibility of Malayan ministers. However, during this period, Britain will continue to maintain full responsibility for external defense through the High Commissioner and retain within the Federation "such forces as they consider necessary for the external defense of the territory and the fulfillment of British Commonwealth and international obligations."

    印报指责英国对马来亚前途的安排
    据新华社新德里12日电　印度报纸在评论2月8日在伦敦公布的关于马来亚政治地位的谈判结果的时候，着重抨击了在马来亚联合邦实行完全自治和独立以后英国军队仍驻留在马来亚的安排。“印度斯坦旗报”10日说：英国军队驻留在马来亚“对亚洲的情绪说来是很令人厌恶的事。”
    9日的“国民先驱报”说，有了这些条件，“马来亚的独立就被削去了一部分”。这家报纸支持马来亚共产党在它的宣言中所表示的立场，它说，“共产党拒绝英军驻留在独立之后的马来亚，这将是对的，并且会获得许多人的支持。”
    据新华社讯　伦敦消息：英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德和马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼2月8日在伦敦签署了关于马来亚政治地位的谈判的报告。报告说，英国同意马来亚联合邦代表团的要求：“应当在1957年8月以前宣布马来亚联合邦实行英联邦范围内的完全自治和独立，如果可能的话。”
    报告说，在马来亚联合邦实行完全自治和独立之前的“过渡时期”内，马来亚的国内防务和治安将交由马来亚的部长负责。但是在这期间，英国将继续通过高级专员保持对外防御方面的全部责任，并且在联合邦内保留“他们认为为了对外保卫领土和履行英国联邦和国际义务所必需的部队”。
