    Advanced Cooperative Q&A Office
    After the agricultural production cooperative led by Su Dianxuan of Malou Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, transitioned into an advanced cooperative, a "Q&A Office" was established in the farm club. On market days, it answers various specific questions raised by nearby farmers about the establishment and promotes the benefits of advanced cooperatives. This method is very popular among farmers. On January 1st, the day the Q&A Office was established, it answered questions raised by 42 farmers from nearby townships. Wang Bing-san, a farmer from Yangzhuang Township, worked well and did a lot of work in the elementary cooperative and was afraid that his original work points would be "invalidated" after the transition to the advanced cooperative. He felt relieved after asking at the Q&A Office. Cheng Guangtai from Cheng Village did not understand the production management of the advanced cooperative and was concerned that several hundred households would not be able to produce together. After the Q&A Office introduced him to the production organization and management methods of the advanced cooperative, he happily returned to the village to promote it. Liu Zongtai, an upper-middle peasant from Sun Village, had invested a lot in the elementary cooperative and was afraid that he would not be compensated after the transition to the advanced cooperative. After hearing about the Q&A Office's handling methods for reimbursing members' investments, he happily said, "I will be the first to sign up to join the advanced cooperative when I go back."

    高级社问事处
    河南省鲁山县马楼乡苏殿选领导的农业生产合作社转成高级社以后，在农庄俱乐部里建立了一个“问事处”，每逢集市，就向附近农民解答建立的各种具体问题，宣传高级社的好处。这种办法很受农民欢迎。1月1日，问事处建立的那天，就解答了附近各乡42个农民所提出的问题。杨庄乡农民王丙三在初级社劳动好，干活多，怕转高级社后把原来做的工分“作废”了，到问事处问了以后就放心了。程庄村程广太对高级社的生产管理不了解，顾虑几百户在一块没法生产，问事处向他介绍了高级社的生产组织、管理方法后，他愉快地回到村里，进行宣传。孙庄乡上中农刘宗太在初级社投资较多，怕转高级社后，不给报酬；听了问事处关于社员投资偿还处理办法后，高兴地说：“我回去要第一个报名参加高级社。”
