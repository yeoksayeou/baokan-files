    The Defect Elimination Campaign at the Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory
    A defect elimination campaign initiated by workers is unfolding at the state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory. After starting in the spinning workshop on February 20th, the movement quickly spread to the entire spinning and weaving factory.
    In the past, the weaving workshop of this factory often produced defective cloth due to the presence of slub yarn in the weft yarn, failing to meet the quality plan. Dozens of defective weft yarns had to be returned to the spinning workshop every day. On the 20th, workers in the spinning workshop held a meeting to study the reasons for the slub yarn. It turned out that a large part was due to careless operation by the roving workers, which caused the lint from the roller and the flying cotton to adhere to the roving. When spun into yarn, this created uneven slub yarn. Therefore, when working, the spinning workers took care to remove the bad roving and return it to the roving workshop.
    Workers in the roving workshop have been holding meetings intensely for days, checking the causes of defects. The workers of the second roving shift in Team C found that Zhu Xiaomei, a tender, produced the fewest defects, so they all learned from her. Each team proposed to increase patrol time, do more cleaning work, and the doffers actively helped the tenders find defects, preventing defects from slipping through. In the past two days, the phenomenon of looms stopping to repair the cloth surface due to bad weft yarn in the weaving workshop has decreased by about half compared to the previous days.

### 上海第五棉纺织厂的消灭次品运动

    上海第五棉纺织厂的消灭次品运动
    一个由工人发起的消灭次品运动，正在国营上海第五棉纺织厂展开。2月20日，这个运动从细纱车间开始以后，迅速传到整个纺、织工场。
    这个厂的织布工场，以往经常因为纡纱中含有竹节纱而织出坏布，完不成质量计划，每天都要有几十只坏纡纱被退回到细纱车间来。20日，细纱车间工人开会研究了出竹节纱的原因。原来很大一部分是因为组纱工人操作不当心，使绒板花和飞花附着在粗纱上，纺成细纱就成为粗细不匀的竹节纱。于是，细纱工人工作时注意把坏粗纱拿下来，退回到粗纱车间。
    粗纱车间工人连日来都在紧张开会，检查出次品的原因。丙班二道粗纱的工人发现挡车工诸小妹出的次品最少，就都向她学习；各个小组都提出增加巡回时间，多做清洁工作，落纱工主动帮助挡车工找次品，不让次品滑过去。最近两天，织布车间因为纡纱不好，迫使布机停台修补布面的现象，比前几天大约减少了一半。
