State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in Liaoning Province recently allocated more than 10,000 tons of festival supplies, which were continuously transported to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various places. The supply of towels, socks, woolen sweaters, sugar, etc., by the China Department Store Liaoning Provincial Company has increased by 50% to three times compared with last year. More than 3,000 retail outlets in the Jiangsu Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative system are supplying 20% to 50% more non-staple foods of various kinds than in the same period last year. Several thousand tons of food, general merchandise, cotton cloth, New Year pictures, cultural and recreational supplies needed by urban and rural people in Shaanxi Province for the Spring Festival have been transferred to grassroots sales units 10 days before the Spring Festival in advance. This year's festive supplies supplied by Chongqing to rural areas in Sichuan, Yunnan and other places include bicycles, radios, alarm clocks and other higher-end consumer goods.

    据新华社讯　为了满足广大人民今年过春节的需要，各地国营商业部门正充足地供应各种物资。辽宁省国营商业部门和供销合作社最近调拨了万余吨节日物资，源源运到各地基层供销合作社。中国百货公司辽宁省公司供应的毛巾、袜子、绒衣、食糖等都比去年增加了50％到三倍左右。江苏省供销合作社系统的3，000多个零售点，今年供应的各种副食品比去年同期增加20％到50％。陕西省各地供应城乡人民春节需要的几千吨食品、百货、棉布和年画、文化娱乐用品已提前在春节前10天调运到基层销售单位。重庆市今年供应四川、云南等地农村的节日物资中包括自行车、收音机、闹钟等较高级的消费品。青海的食品公司和贸易公司已经给柴达木盆地和玉树、果洛、海南等牧业区运去了450多吨新鲜猪肉、冰冻鲜鸡肉、冰冻鲤鱼、鸡蛋、蔬菜、糖果、茶叶、纸烟、酒和罐头食品，总值约相当于去年春节前运出物资的三倍。
    这几天，上海街头到处是提着大包小篓购买年货的人，南京路上最热闹的一带，每天下午道路几乎为之阻塞。国营上海市第一百货商店在2月5日一天内就接待了20万以上的顾客。
