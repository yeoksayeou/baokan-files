    Don't Blindly "Break with Convention"
    Han Ling
    When the Xiaqiao Coal Mine of the Jiawang Mining Bureau criticized right-leaning conservative thought, some leading staff members disregarded production safety and one-sidedly emphasized "breaking with convention," resulting in a very serious situation where basic-level cadres and workers violated operating procedures under the guise of "breaking with convention." In mid-January, when the second coal mining team was mining coal at workface 133, the safety exit of the workface was short and narrow, and most of the sheds were already broken. Workers had to crawl in and out. Safety inspectors repeatedly suggested and urged repairs, but the squad leader, Sun Yushan, said, "If we follow the safety regulations, we won't be able to break with convention!" The upper safety exit of the 110 coal mining workface was so small that people couldn't even crawl through it, and most of the nearby sheds were also broken. However, under the argument that "following the regulations makes it impossible to break with convention," Jin Shangjun, the coal mining district chief, refused the inspectors' suggestion to "quickly repair and enlarge" the exit. In mid-January, hook workers Liu Xuehao and Zhang Lantian, in order to "break with convention," did not follow the procedures and exceeded the load limit of the small electric winch (3 cars), hooking 7 cars at once. As a result, they lost control and the cars derailed midway, causing an accident that injured 2 workers. Since the mine switched to vertical shaft transportation of personnel at the beginning of this year, it has been stipulated that no more than 6 people can be transported at a time, based on the cage's square footage and the absence of cage curtains. However, the mine director, Gong, and the production management section chief, Zhang, insisted on having 8 people ride each time. After the technical safety inspection section raised objections, Director Gong ignored them, and Section Chief Zhang even threatened inspector Chen Jiading, saying, "This is the director's instruction. In order to break with convention, we cannot talk about safety regulations!" He also encouraged several workers to resist the inspection together. At 10 a.m. on January 15, the power went out at the No. 3 main roadway air shaft of the mine, and the main fans were forced to stop. In principle, measures should have been taken immediately, or the workers should have been notified to evacuate. However, in order to "break with convention," the mine took no measures and did not order the workers to evacuate the workface, causing the workers in these three workfaces to be suffocated for more than an hour, which was very dangerous.
    At present, the enthusiasm of workers and the masses on the industrial production front is rising. After the masses are mobilized, criticizing the right-leaning conservative ideas of the leadership, and breaking those outdated rules and regulations that are not suitable for the current production needs, is of course a good phenomenon. However, this does not mean opposing all correct and necessary conventions. It is a very big mistake for the leaders of the Xiaqiao Coal Mine of the Jiawang Mining Bureau to simply seek "speed" and "quantity" and even break the necessary "conventions" that guarantee production safety.

    不要盲目“打破常规”
    寒凌
    贾汪矿务局夏桥煤矿在批判右倾保守思想的时候，部分领导工作人员不顾生产安全，片面强调“打破常规”，以致造成基层干部和工人在“打破常规”的借口下，违犯作业规程的情况十分严重。采煤第二队1月中旬在一三三工作面采煤的时候，工作面安全出口又矮又小，棚子大部分也已经折断，工人出入都必须爬行，安全检查人员曾一再建议和督促修理，而班长孙玉山却说：“执行保安规程，就别想打破常规啦！”一一○采煤工作面上部安全出口小得连人也爬不过去，附近的棚子也大部折断，而采煤区长靳尚俊也在“按规程办事，就无法打破常规”的论调下，拒绝检查人员提出的“迅速修理刷大”的建议。1月中旬挂钩工人刘学浩、张兰田二人为了“打破常规”，不执行规程，超过小电绞车负荷规定（3个车），一次挂7个车，结果因为煞不住闸而中途脱钩，造成跑车事故，一次碰伤工人2人。该矿自今年1月初改为立井上下人以后，根据罐笼平方面积和没有罐档帘的情况，规定每次上下至多不能超过6个人。但是，这个矿公矿长和生产管理科张科长，硬指示每次坐8个人。技术安全检查科提出意见后，公矿长竟置之不理，张科长更威胁检查员陈家鼎说：“这是矿长指示的，为了突破常规，我们就不能讲保安规程！”他还鼓动几个工人来一起对抗检查。1月15日上午10点，这个矿三大巷风井停电，主要风车被迫停开。照理，必须立即采取措施，或者通知工人撤出来。但是，这个矿为了“打破常规”，竟不采取任何措施，也不命令工人撤出工作面，致使在这三个工作面的工人被闷了一个多小时，情况十分危险。
    目前工业生产战线上职工群众的劳动热情日渐高涨。群众行动起来以后，批判领导上的右倾保守思想，要打破那些过了时的不适合当前生产需要的，清规戒律，这当然是一种好现象。但是，这并不是要把一切正确的必要的常规都反对掉。贾汪矿务局夏桥煤矿的领导人员单纯为了求“快”求“多”，连保证生产安全的必要的“常规”也要打破，这是十分错误的。
