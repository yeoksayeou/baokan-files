    Research and Manufacture of Antibiotics
    The discovery and application of antibiotics is one of the major scientific achievements of the past decade or so. Since antibiotics were successfully researched and applied to medical and healthcare work, they have had remarkable success in the treatment and prevention of many serious and intractable diseases caused by microbial infections, such as pneumonia, typhoid fever, and typhus. Antibiotics are even more significant in the treatment of trauma and war wounds, and in national defense. Antibiotics not only play a major role in protecting people's health, but have also been extended to the prevention and control of livestock and plant diseases, becoming an important means of ensuring increased agricultural and animal husbandry production. In the food industry, antibiotics have also begun to be used as preservatives.
    In old China, due to the reactionary rulers' disregard for the health of the people, there was no antibiotic manufacturing industry at all, and the very small amount of antibiotics used were all imported from abroad; there was also no foundation for antibiotic research. After liberation, the Party and the government gave great encouragement and support to the scientific research and production of antibiotics. Our country's scientific research workers absorbed the international experience in antibiotic research and production, and with positive and enthusiastic creative labor, have achieved certain successes in the research, manufacture, and testing of antibiotics. In 1950, China built a penicillin factory, and successively established a chloramphenicol factory, starting to produce penicillin and chloromycetin. Since then, chlortetracycline and streptomycin have also been successfully trial-produced; and further expansion of experiments is underway to prepare for the construction of new factories and the expansion of production.
    The achievements made by scientific research workers in our country through mutual cooperation in the research, improvement of product quality, and clinical application of antibiotics have brought important and favorable conditions for carrying out people's medical and health work.

    抗生素的研究和制造
    抗生素的发现和应用是近十几年来科学上的重大成就之一。自从抗生素研究成功并应用到医疗保健工作上以后，对于很多微生物感染的严重疾病和顽抗性的疾病，例如肺炎、伤寒、斑疹伤寒等的治疗和预防有了卓越的成效。抗生素对于创伤和战伤的治疗，在国防上更有重大的意义。抗生素不仅对保护人民的健康有重大作用，而且已经推广到牲畜和植物病害的防治方面，成为保证农业和畜牧业增产的一个重要手段。在食品工业中也开始应用抗生素做为防腐剂。
    在旧中国，由于反动统治者漠视人民的健康，根本就没有抗生素制造工业，所用的为数甚少的一部分抗生素都是从国外进口；抗生素的研究工作也没有基础。解放以后，党和政府对于抗生素的科学研究和生产制造工作给予极大的鼓励和支持。我国科学研究工作者们吸收国际间抗生素研究生产的经验，并以积极热情的创造性劳动，在抗生素的研究、制造与检定工作方面获得了一定的成就。1950年我国修建了青霉素工厂，相继又建立了氯霉素工厂，开始生产青霉素和合霉素。此后还试制成功了金霉素和链霉素；并且正在进一步扩大试验，为配合建设新厂和扩大生产作准备。
    我国科学研究工作者互相配合协同合作，在抗生素的研究、改进制品质量和临床应用的工作上所取得的成绩，给开展人民的医疗保健工作带来了重要的有利条件。
