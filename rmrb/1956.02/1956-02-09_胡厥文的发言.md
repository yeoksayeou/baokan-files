Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our people across the country have united as one and worked together, achieving brilliant accomplishments in politics, economy, education, and culture. Our international standing has also been raised to an unprecedented level, washing away decades of worries and anger from my heart and immersing me in an atmosphere of joy and happiness. Recently, the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has followed one after another, progressing rapidly. At this conference, I listened to the reports of Chairman Zhou and Vice Chairmen Li, Guo, Chen, and Dong, as well as Committee Member Chen Boda. The brilliance of the new China has made me particularly excited. I wholeheartedly support it and am willing to work hard to implement their instructions.

I am an industrialist and businessman, as well as an intellectual with knowledge of mechanical engineering. I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of intellectuals first.

Chairman Zhou pointed out in his report the importance of science and technology for socialist construction and that we should strengthen the education and transformation of intellectuals, improve the use and arrangement of intellectuals, trust and support their work, so that they can fully unleash their potential, improve our scientific and technological level, and accelerate the development of the national economy to catch up with the level of advanced countries within 12 years. This instruction is the most important and timely at present. We must liberate Taiwan and complete the unification of the country. To build our country into a strong socialist country and strengthen the forces of the democratic, peaceful, and socialist camp, we must, in the final analysis, first improve our production, increase social productivity, and complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan ahead of schedule. Our country has the conditions to improve production. Our country is vast and rich in resources, with no shortage of materials. We have a large population and abundant manpower. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the power unleashed by the unity of the people is inestimable. Chairman Mao pointed out: "What determines everything is to have cadres, to have a sufficient number of excellent scientific and technological experts." However, we do not have enough scientific and technological personnel, and their quality is not up to the level of advanced countries, so we need to train a large number of new technical personnel and also fully unleash the potential of existing technical personnel.

It should be admitted that the potential of many technical personnel has not yet been fully realized. The reasons can be divided into two aspects: on the one hand, the original technical personnel were deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology in the past. Although they have changed through study, many still think they are studying science and do not care much about politics, and they are arrogant and unwilling to easily accept other people's opinions. There are also people who specialize in scientific theory who despise technical workers and cannot cooperate effectively. This requires strengthening political and theoretical study and striving to transform thinking. On the other hand, some departments still have some shortcomings in the use of technical personnel: some do not pay enough attention to their reasonable suggestions, some lack support for their research and trial production work, and some lack appropriate praise and encouragement for new technical achievements. For example, technical personnel are reluctant to accept new things easily, which seems very stubborn, but when they thoroughly understand the details and accept new things, they are very sincere. Therefore, we hope that the departments that use technical personnel should be good at grasping their characteristics and patiently educate and help them. Now that I have listened to Chairman Zhou's report, everyone will definitely be able to eliminate the above-mentioned shortcomings in accordance with the instructions in the future, combine technology with politics, and combine theory with practice, so that they can fully unleash their potential. This will greatly promote the development of social productive forces and the improvement of scientific and technological levels.

I would also like to talk about the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Chairman Zhou said: "The high tide of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce that is currently unfolding throughout the country is only the beginning of further in-depth transformation." After our enterprises are approved for joint state-private ownership, we must obey the state plan, actively do a good job in joint operations, improve business management, improve product quality, increase production, and reduce costs. In particular, various incorrect ideas that arise during the joint operation time due to insufficient understanding must be corrected. In terms of personal transformation, we must deeply recognize the shamefulness of exploitation and wage a ruthless and sharp struggle against bourgeois ideology in order to gradually learn the working class's selfless virtues. This is a long-term process of ideological transformation, and I myself think it is not simple. Therefore, the main key is to strengthen propaganda and education work. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association should adapt to various different situations in various regions and industries, and organize off-the-job training, spare-time schools, correspondence schools, or organize visits and lectures, and study Marxist-Leninist theory on the principle of voluntariness. Using a variety of learning methods can gradually expand the ranks of progressive core members of the business community, and the more backward can also be universally improved.

Now some capitalists think that the enterprises have embarked on joint state-private ownership, the hat of the capitalists has been removed, and the boundary with the working class has completely disappeared. I don't think this is right, and it will hinder further transformation. I think that the material foundation of capitalism in our country has undergone fundamental changes, which is a fact. But it does not mean that there is no boundary between the working class and the bourgeoisie now. I think this boundary should be distinguished and not blurred. Only when the capitalist ownership is changed into public ownership by the whole people, the material basis of this boundary is completely eliminated, and at that time, the hat of the capitalists will naturally be removed. This is like Sun Wukong in Journey to the West, he tried his best to remove the "golden hoop" on his head, but he could not remove it all the way, and later when he arrived in "Western Paradise", he said to the Buddha: "Can I remove this 'golden hoop' now?" The Buddha said: "Touch it yourself." He touched his head, and the "golden hoop" was gone. This shows that: "When the water comes, the channel is naturally formed." Therefore, our friends in the business community must continue to work hard to transform themselves on the existing basis, and strive to change themselves more happily into glorious working people of socialist society in the shortest possible time.

    胡厥文的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    解放几年来，我们全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，团结一心，共同奋斗，已在政治、经济、教育、文化各方面取得了极其辉煌的成就，国际地位也空前提高，洗净了我数十年来胸中的忧虑和忿怒，而使我浸沉在欢欣快乐的气氛中。最近，农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮接踵而来，进展之速，一日千里。我在这次大会上，听到了周主席和李、郭、陈、董各位副主席以及陈伯达委员的报告，新中国光辉灿烂，使我格外兴奋，衷心拥护，并愿为贯彻他们的指示而努力。
    我是一个工商业者，也是学机械工程的知识分子，我先就关于知识分子的问题，提供一些意见。
    周主席在报告中指出科学技术对于社会主义建设事业的重要性，并指出应该加强对知识分子的教育与改造，改善对知识分子的使用与安排，对他们的工作应加以信任与支持，使他们能充分发挥潜在力量，提高我们科学技术的水平，加速国民经济的发展，在12年内，赶上先进国家的水平。这一指示，是当前最重要而及时的。我们一定要解放台湾，完成国家的统一。我们国家要建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家，增强民主、和平、社会主义阵营的力量，归根到底，首先要搞好我们的生产，提高社会生产力，提前完成并超额完成第一个五年计划。我国要搞好生产的条件是具备的。我国地大物博，资源无虞缺乏，人口众多，人力异常充沛，我们在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，万众一心，发挥出来的力量是无可估计的。毛主席指出：“决定一切的是要有干部，要有数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家”。而我们的科学技术人材，数量不够，质量也赶不上先进国家的水平，所以需要培养大批新的技术人材，同时还须使原有技术人材的潜在力量，充分发挥。
    应该承认，目前很多技术人材的潜在力量还没有充分发挥出来，原因可以分两方面来讲：一方面，原有技术人材过去受到资产阶级思想的影响很深，通过学习，虽已有转变，但是还有不少的人自以为是学科学的，不大关心政治，而且自高自大，不肯轻易接受别人的意见；还有专门研究科学理论的人与技术工人彼此轻视，不能通力合作。这就需要加强政治与理论的学习，努力改造思想。另一方面，有些部门使用技术人材还存在着一些缺点：有的对他们的合理建议重视不够，有的对他们研究和试制工作缺乏支持；有的对于技术上的新成就缺乏适当的表扬与鼓励。又如技术人材碰到新事物，不肯轻易地加以接受，看来似乎很顽固，但当他们彻底了解底细而接受新事物的时候，倒是很诚恳的。所以我们希望使用技术人员的部门要善于掌握他们的特点，而加以耐心细致的教育与帮助。现在我听了周主席的报告，今后大家一定可以依照指示，把上述这些缺点，加以消除，使技术与政治相结合，理论与实际相结合，从而使他们充分发挥潜在力量。这对于发展社会生产力和提高科学技术的水平，将有极大的推动作用。
    我还谈一谈私营工商业的社会主义改造的问题。周主席说：“目前正在全国展开的私营工商业的社会主义改造的高潮，还只是进一步深入改造的开始。”我们企业在批准全业合营后，必须服从国家计划，积极做好合营工作，改善经营管理，提高产品质量，增加生产，减低成本。尤其是在合营时间因认识不够而产生的各种不正确思想，必须加以纠正。在个人改造方面，必须深切认识剥削的可耻，对于资产阶级思想要展开无情而尖锐的斗争，方能逐步学习工人阶级大公无私的品德。这是一个长期的思想改造过程，我自己想想也觉得是不简单的。所以主要的关键，是加强宣教工作。我们民建和工商联，应当在党和政府的领导下，适应各地区各行业各种不同的情况，举办脱产轮训业余学校、函授学校，或组织参观，举办讲座，在自愿的原则下，学习马克思列宁主义的理论。运用多种多样的学习方法，可使工商界进步核心分子的队伍逐步扩大，而比较落后的也可以普遍提高。
    现在有些资本家以为企业走上公私合营，资本家的帽子已经取消了，同工人阶级的界限已经完全没有了。我认为这是不对的，这会妨碍进一步改造的。我想目前我国的资本主义的物质基础起了基本变化，这是事实。但还不等于现在工人阶级和资产阶级之间已经没有界限了。我认为这个界限是应当分清而不应当模糊的。只有在资本家所有制改变成为全民所有制的时候，这种界限的物质基础完全消除了，到那个时候资本家的帽子自然去掉了。这好比西游记上的那个孙行者，他用尽方法硬要去掉他头上的“金箍咒”，但一路上始终去不掉，后来到了“西天”，他向如来佛说：“我现在这个‘金箍咒’可以去掉了吗？”如来佛说：“你自己摸摸看。”他摸一摸自己的头，那个“金箍咒”已经没有了。这就说明：“水到自然渠成”。因此，我们工商界朋友们还必须在现有的基础上努力进一步改造自己，争取在最快时期内，更愉快地把自己改变为一个光荣的社会主义社会的劳动人民。
