    Building water conservancy projects in farmland and eliminating flood and drought disasters are fundamental measures to ensure increased agricultural production. In order to achieve the grain and cotton production increase targets proposed in the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967," one of the most important tasks is to concentrate efforts on solving the water problem and strive to basically eliminate ordinary flood and drought disasters within 7 to 12 years.
    For thousands of years, flood and drought disasters have been the most serious natural disasters in China's agricultural production. Since liberation, China has built many large-scale water conservancy projects, and has also universally built small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, which have played a significant role in reducing flood and drought disasters and ensuring agricultural production. However, so far, China's water conservancy undertaking is still far behind the needs of production development. Many rivers still cannot withstand extra-large floods; mountain floods and waterlogging disasters in some areas are still very serious; the country's existing irrigation area is less than a quarter of the cultivated land area, and about half of it has weak drought resistance capabilities. In recent years, tens of millions of acres of farmland have suffered from flood and drought disasters every year. We need to continue our efforts to change this situation.
    Fundamentally controlling the water disasters of major rivers and developing the water resources of major rivers are fundamental measures to eliminate flood and drought disasters; more and better work must be done according to the national plan. However, the fundamental control and development of huge rivers requires huge financial resources, complex technologies, and a long period of time, and it is difficult to obtain significant benefits in the short term. In order to meet the urgent needs of agricultural production, efforts must also be made to develop mass farmland water conservancy projects. This type of project requires less money, has quick results, yields large benefits, and is easy to implement, making it most suitable for China's current rural conditions of manpower, material resources, and technology. As long as the labor force, financial resources, material resources, and technical forces of the masses are well organized, and the state provides appropriate assistance in terms of technology and economy, it is entirely possible to build them quickly and in large quantities. Jilin Province paid attention to this work in 1955. In one year, the province expanded paddy fields by more than 17,950 hectares and irrigated land by more than 11,000 hectares, increasing grain production by more than 40,000 tons. From this, it can be seen that small-scale farmland water conservancy projects should be widely promoted so that agriculture in vast areas can rapidly increase production.
    The agricultural cooperativization movement has created the most favorable conditions for the widespread construction of farmland water conservancy projects. From last autumn and winter to the present, without exception, both newly established and earlier established agricultural producers' cooperatives have taken water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation as the primary measures to increase production, and have launched a large-scale movement of well-digging, canal-opening, pond-digging, and dam-building. Things that individual farmers could never do can be done through cooperation; things that one or two cooperatives find difficult to do can be done through the joint action of several cooperatives. Relying on the strength of cooperativization, it is possible not only to dig more wells, open more canals, dig more ponds, build more dams, and carry out soil and water conservation projects in a planned manner, but also to gradually build larger reservoirs and implement mechanical irrigation and mechanical drainage. Henan Province has decided to adopt the method of building water conservancy projects focusing on digging wells to reach springs, and to basically eliminate drought disasters within two years and basically eliminate flood disasters within five years. Other provinces and regions have also made similar plans based on local conditions. Starting in 1956, it seems that basically eliminating ordinary flood and drought disasters within 7 to 12 years can not only be completed as scheduled, but may also be achieved ahead of schedule.
    In order to carry out farmland water conservancy work in a planned manner, it is necessary to formulate realistic and feasible basin plans for small and medium-sized rivers and comprehensive farmland water conservancy plans on the basis of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production planning, and to set out annual implementation plans to carry them out in stages and batches. Many farmland water conservancy projects often cannot be done by one cooperative, one township, or one county, and require the concerted cooperation of several cooperatives, several townships, or several counties; many water conservancy projects not only relate to agricultural production, but also relate to other production departments, and require the coordinated action of relevant departments. Without an overall plan, it is not only impossible to rationally utilize water resources and fully exert the effectiveness of water conservancy facilities, but it may also cause conflicts between upstream and downstream, left and right banks, or various units, resulting in unnecessary losses. This kind of thing has happened repeatedly and should be avoided as much as possible. The extensive construction of farmland water conservancy requires a large amount of labor, water conservancy machinery, and building materials. Without a comprehensive plan and phased implementation plan, it is impossible to organize labor in a planned manner and supply the necessary materials in a timely manner. Therefore, all localities must make plans and seize the implementation to speed up the construction progress and prevent idle work.
    All localities should give full play to the potential of existing water conservancy facilities. In recent years, all localities have made certain achievements in improving the water management system and improving water use methods. However, the management of many projects is still very backward. For example, some areas lack sound water conservancy organizations and necessary water use regulations, and some areas adopt backward methods of flood irrigation. This reduces the effectiveness of the project and often causes soil alkalization, which must be improved. In order to give full play to the role of existing water conservancy projects, the decentralized operation and management should be changed to joint operation and management. Irrigation areas that draw water from the same river section should gradually implement unified management based on natural conditions and actual needs; improve old projects, improve water conveyance and distribution systems, and strengthen water control equipment; at the same time, improve irrigation technology. Dryland areas should promote furrow irrigation, ridge irrigation, and water storage and moisture conservation irrigation methods, and paddy field areas should implement advanced methods of frequent and shallow irrigation.
    At present, farmers in most areas are making every effort to build farmland water conservancy projects, and some areas are stepping up preparations for large-scale farmland water conservancy construction. Party and government leading organs at all levels should attach importance to and actively lead the mass water conservancy construction and strive to achieve the arduous task of eliminating flood and drought disasters.

### 兴修农田水利，消灭水旱灾害

    兴修农田水利，消灭水旱灾害
    兴修水利、消灭水旱灾害，是保证农业增产的基本措施。为了实现“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”（草案）提出的粮、棉增产指标，最重要的任务之一，就是集中力量解决水的问题，争取在7年到12年的时间以内，基本上消灭普通的水旱灾害。
    几千年来，水旱灾害一直是我国农业生产上最严重的自然灾害。解放以后，我国修建了很多大规模的水利工程，同时普遍地兴修了小型农田水利，这对减轻水旱灾害、保障农业生产起了很大作用。但是，到目前为止，我国的水利事业还是远远的落后于生产发展的需要。还有不少河流经不起特大洪水的袭击；有些地区山洪和内涝灾害还很严重；全国已有的灌溉面积不到耕地面积的四分之一，其中约有半数抗旱能力不强。近几年来，每年都有几千万亩耕地遭受水旱灾害。这种情况需要我们继续努力把它改变过来。
    根治各大河流的水害，开发各大河流的水利，这是消灭水旱灾害的根本措施；必须按照国家计划，作的更多更好。但是，根治和开发巨大的河流，需要庞大的财力、复杂的技术和较长的时间，短期间很难得到显著的效益。为了满足农业生产的迫切需要，还必须努力发展群众性的农田水利工程。这种工程花钱少，见效快、收益大、容易办，最适合我国农村目前的人力、物力、技术等条件。只要把群众的劳力、财力、物力和技术力量很好地组织起来，国家在技术上、经济上再给以适当的援助，完全可以迅速、大量地兴建。吉林省1955年就注意了这个工作，全省在1年当中，扩大水田17，950多公顷，水浇地11，000多公顷，增产粮食4万多吨。由此可见，小型农田水利工程应该普遍推广，使广大地区的农业能够迅速增产。
    农业合作化运动创造了普遍兴修农田水利工程的最有利的条件。从去年秋冬到现在，无论新建立的和早建立的农业生产合作社，都没有例外地把兴修水利、保持水土作为增加生产的首要措施，开展了大规模的打井、开渠、挖塘、筑坝运动。个体农民从来办不到的事，合作起来就能办了；一两个社难以办到的事，几个社协同动作就办起来了。依靠合作化的力量，不但可以更多地打井、开渠、挖塘、筑坝和有计划地进行水土保持工程，并且可以逐步兴修较大的水库，实行机械灌溉和机械排水。河南省决定采取以打井下泉为主的兴修水利工程的方法，在两年内基本消灭旱灾，在五年内基本消灭水灾。别的省区也根据当地的具体条件，作了类似的规划。从1956年开始，在7年到12年内基本上消灭普通的水旱灾害，看来不仅可以如期完成，而且可能提前实现。
    为了有计划地开展农田水利工作，必须在农业合作化和农业生产规划的基础上，制定实事求是、切实可行的中小河流的流域规划和农田水利全面规划，并且定出分年实施的计划，有步骤地分批地进行。许多农田水利工程往往不是一个社、一个乡、一个县作得了的，需要几个社、几个乡或几个县通力合作；许多水利工程不仅关系农业生产，并且关系其他生产部门，更需要有关部门协同动作。如果没有一个通盘的规划，不仅不能合理利用水利资源，全面发挥水利设备的效能，而且可能引起上下游、左右岸或各单位之间的矛盾，造成不应有的损失。这种事情是一再发生过的，应当极力加以避免。广泛地兴修农田水利，需要大量的劳动力、水利机械和建筑器材，如果没有全面规划和分期实施计划，就不能够有计划地组织劳力，及时供应必需的物资。因此，各地必须做出规划，并且抓紧实施，以便加快建设进度，防止窝工现象。
    各地对于已有的水利设施的潜力，应当充分加以发挥。几年以来，各地在改进用水管理制度，改善用水方法等方面，都有了一定的成绩。但是，目前许多工程的管理还是很落后的。例如，有的地区缺乏健全的水利组织和必要的用水规章，有的地区采用落后的大水漫灌的方法。这就降低了工程的效益，还常常造成土壤碱化的现象，必须加以改进。为了充分发挥现有水利工程的作用，应该把分散的经营管理改变为联合的经营管理，在同一河段取水的灌区，应该根据自然条件和实际需要，逐步实行统一管理；改善旧有工程，健全输水配水系统，加强控制水量的设备；同时要改进灌溉技术。旱作区应该推行沟灌畦灌和储水保墒灌溉的方法，水稻灌区应该实行勤灌浅灌的先进方法。
    目前多数地区的农民正在全力兴修农田水利工程，有的地区正在加紧准备大规模兴修农田水利的条件。各级党政领导机关应当重视并积极领导群众性的水利建设，为实现消灭水旱灾害的艰巨任务而努力。
