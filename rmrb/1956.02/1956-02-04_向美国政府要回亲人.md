Editor's Note: This is the latest batch of letters from relatives of Chinese students in the United States recently received by this newspaper and relevant departments in our country. From these letters, it can be seen that Chinese students in the United States have suffered all kinds of persecution from the U.S. government authorities, and some have even gone missing for insisting on returning to China! The Chinese people express great indignation at this! Where is someone like Jiang Yun'gao now? The U.S. government authorities must give a responsible explanation. The U.S. government should honestly implement the agreement on the return of civilians from both sides, abandon those despicable and shameful means, and allow Chinese nationals and students in the United States who request to return to China to return home immediately.

Letter from Wang Hongyi, wife of Liao Shantao
	I am a people's teacher and also the mother of two children. According to human sentiment and common sense, I should, and could, have a happy family. However, my family lacks a major member, that is, the biological father of my children—my husband, who has been detained by the U.S. government for a long time and cannot return home freely.
	The matter is like this: In 1948, my husband, Liao Shantao, went to the University of Chicago in the United States to study mathematics. In the past few years, Shantao has been constantly thinking of home and missing his lovely motherland. In 1952, he tried to return to China, but on the way back, he was intercepted and taken back to the United States by the U.S. government in San Francisco. He wrote at the time, "I think of returning, but it is thousands of miles away, and there is no way to fly across. What can be done? Chinese people studying mathematics, physics, chemistry... here are all being obstructed by the U.S. Immigration Bureau from returning home."
	Last September, he formally requested the U.S. government to return to China again and sent his passport. But what was the U.S. authorities' response? "Silence," "no words," like a "mute." From a letter he sent at the end of December, it can be seen that he was "heavy-hearted" and suffered great mental threats.
	Truth cannot be refuted, and facts cannot be erased. No matter how the U.S. government conceals and obstructs, no one can distort my husband, Liao Shantao's, righteous demand to return to China!
	Who has long torn apart my happy family? The U.S. government should bear this responsibility. Therefore, I firmly request the government to raise this matter to the U.S. government at the Geneva Conference, and specifically ask them to release my husband. At the same time, release all Chinese students who have gone to the United States to study like Shantao, so that they can reunite with their long-separated beloved parents, wives, and children, and return to the happy embrace of the prosperous and strong motherland.

Letter from Wang Weishen, fiancée of Jiang Yun'gao
	My fiancé, Jiang Yun'gao, went to the United States to study in 1948, majoring in electrical engineering at Indiana State University. After graduation, he worked at the Electrical Research Institute in Dayton, Ohio. Since 1952, he has been trying his best to return to China, but due to the obstruction of the U.S. government, he still cannot return to his motherland, which he misses day and night. At the same time, Yun'gao and I have been separated for eight years and cannot reunite.
	Jiang Yun'gao is eager to return to China. In a letter in August 1952, he said: "I am now like a wandering child, wanting to throw myself into my mother's arms. The motherland—this great mother—makes me yearn." In another letter, he said: "Seeing the news of the motherland's prosperity, I have unspeakable joy in my heart."
	In order to return to the motherland, he thought of many ways, but all of them could not be realized due to the obstruction of the U.S. government. In a letter in March 1953, he said: "There is no freedom here at all. But I will be able to fly away once I get out of this birdcage. The problem now is in this birdcage. I must be careful everywhere. If I don't pay attention to small problems, it will be difficult." In another letter, he said indignantly, "Although they claim 'freedom,' where is 'freedom'?"
	Because of Jiang Yun'gao's consistent actions to strive for returning to China and his eagerness to serve the motherland, he has suffered many persecutions. A letter in August 1953 said: "There is an important matter to tell you. In recent months, several of my former colleagues and classmates have written to say that special agents have gone to their places to investigate my situation, and they told me to pay attention to everything." At the same time, the U.S. Immigration Bureau threatened him to apply for permanent residence in the United States. More seriously, in December 1953, he suddenly sent a short letter to a friend of mine in Hong Kong, which said, "The environment here is not good. Please send a telegram to Miss Wang immediately, asking her not to write letters, and I will notify her when the situation improves..." From this letter, it can be seen that because he actively strove to return to China, he suffered the pain of persecution by the U.S. government, and finally he was deprived of his freedom of communication.
	It has been two years since I last heard from Yun'gao, and it has been almost five months since the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States reached an agreement on the return of civilians from both sides. However, where is Yun'gao now? Why is there still no news from him? Why hasn't he returned to the embrace of the motherland he yearns for? I hate the U.S. government's brutal behavior of destroying other people's family happiness. At the same time, I request the government to ask the U.S. side to explain the whereabouts of Jiang Yun'gao at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial meeting in Geneva, and be responsible for quickly and safely returning him to China so that we can reunite.

Letter from Bian Yi, father of Bian Xiaxi
	I am 70 years old and used to work in the railway, now retired and enjoying my old age. My son, Bian Xiaxi, went to the Wilkening factory in Philadelphia, USA, in 1944 for an internship, and later worked as an engineer in the factory. Since he went abroad, he has often written letters. In August 1950, he wrote: "As soon as the contract with the factory expires in the early next year, I plan to return to China." Later, I sent two letters in succession, urging him to come back as soon as possible, but I did not receive a reply, and the news has been cut off since then, for five years now. Since the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States in Geneva reached an agreement on the return of civilians from the two countries, the family has been hoping to get news from him as soon as possible, but there is still no news. Obviously, because he is studying aviation engineering, he must have been obstructed, threatened, and persecuted by the U.S. government. It is very clear that the U.S. government is simply denying and lying, and will never honestly abide by the agreement on the repatriation of civilians. Therefore, I request the government to specifically demand the return of my son from the U.S. government at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial meeting in Geneva, and enable all Chinese students and overseas Chinese who want to return but cannot to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, participate in the construction of the motherland, and reunite with their families.

Letter from Jiang Enshan, wife of Zhou Wende
	My husband, Zhou Wende, went to the United States in 1947. He first studied in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and obtained a master's degree. In 1949, he transferred to the University of Illinois and obtained a doctorate in 1950. He then served as an associate professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at the original school for five years. During this period, he often wrote letters, expressing his desire to return to China. However, due to the unreasonable detention by the U.S. government, he felt deeply painful. He wrote in May 1952 that he had already received a notice from the U.S. authorities that he was not allowed to leave the United States. Recently, the remittance of money back to China has also been prohibited for the past three years. He wrote that if he was found out, he would be fined and imprisoned. Now, the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States have reached an agreement on the return of civilians from both sides for several months, but my husband still cannot return. Therefore, I firmly protest against the U.S. government's despicable behavior of not fulfilling the agreement and violating humanitarianism. I request the government to assist so that my husband and Chinese students in the United States can return to the motherland as soon as possible to participate in socialist construction and reunite with their families. This is also a great and bright future for themselves.

Letter from Yu Shengwu, father of Yu Shizheng
	My eldest son, Yu Shizheng, and daughter-in-law, Zhai Yaming, went to Iowa University in the United States in 1945 to study. Shizheng studied advanced statistics and industrial management, and Yaming studied library science. Shizheng obtained a doctorate in 1953. After interning at the University of Chicago for three months, he applied to the U.S. authorities to return to China, but was rejected. Shizheng had no choice but to accept the position of associate professor at the University of Michigan in order to wait for an opportunity to return to China. After the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States reached an agreement on the return of civilians from both sides last year, I sent letters in succession urging them to return to China, but the first reply did not mention returning to China at all. The second reply only vaguely revealed the words "family reunion." This cannot but make people think that they are unable to express and realize their desire to return to China as soon as possible under the obstruction of the U.S. authorities. Now, it has been more than five months since the Sino-U.S. agreement on the return of civilians was reached, but the U.S. authorities have no sincerity in fulfilling the agreement and continue to impose various restrictions and threats on Chinese students in the United States, making it impossible for them to realize their legitimate desire to return to China. This is a tyrannical act that seriously hinders the freedom of others and violates humanitarianism.
	I am now a professor in the Department of History at Northeast People's University, but I am 61 years old and have been separated from my son and daughter-in-law for 11 years. Therefore, I am always hoping that they will return soon. Therefore, I request the government to request the U.S. government to thoroughly implement the agreement on the return of civilians through the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, so that my children and other students in the United States can return to the motherland as soon as possible, reunite with their families, and contribute their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

Letter from Shen Jue, sister of Shen Yao
	My sister, Shen Yao, graduated from Yenching University in 1935 and went to the United States in 1936 to study literature at Mills College. After graduating, she entered the University of Michigan to study linguistics. After completing her studies, she stayed at the school to teach. In 1948, she expressed that she would return after the teaching contract expired. Who knew that when the contract expired, she wanted to return but could not because of the obstruction of the U.S. government.
	In the past few years, she has written letters every month, revealing a sense of depression in her words. After the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks reached an agreement on the return of civilians from both sides, she mentioned the issue of returning to China in her letters, saying that she was eager to return. Last spring, she tried repeatedly, but was unsuccessful. Now, in addition to writing to her to ask her to make a request to the U.S. government again according to the agreement of the talks, I request the government to assist and ask the U.S. government to let her return to China.

### 向美国政府要回亲人

专栏：

    向美国政府要回亲人
    编者按：这是本报和我国有关方面最近收到的又一批留美学生家属的来信。从这些来信中可以看出，我国留美学生遭受到美国政府当局的种种迫害，有的甚至因为坚持要求回国而弄得下落不明！中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨！像蒋云皋这样的人，现在究竟在什么地方？美国政府当局必须作出负责的交代。美国政府应该老老实实执行关于双方平民回国问题的协议，放弃那些卑鄙可耻的手段，让要求回国的中国侨民和留美学生立即回国。
    廖山涛妻子汪鸿仪的来信
    我是一个人民教师，也是两个孩子的妈妈。照人情常理说，我是应该、而且也是可以建立一个幸福的家庭的。可是，我的家庭却缺少一个主要的成员，就是我的孩子的亲爸爸——我的丈夫，他长期地被美国政府扣留不能自由回国。
    事情是这样的：1948年，我丈夫廖山涛到美国的芝加哥大学研究数学。几年来，山涛无时无刻不在惦记着家的，怀念着可爱的祖国。1952年他设法回国，但在回国途中，在旧金山被美国政府拦阻劫回美国。他当时来信说，“我自思归，但迢迢万里，无法飞渡，奈何。在此地学数学、物理、化学……的中国人，美移民局均留难不令返国”。
    去年9月，他再度向美国政府正式提出回国的要求，并把护照寄去。但是美国当局的答复呢？“沉默”、“无语”像一个“哑吧”一样。从他在12月底的一封来信中看出，他“心情沉重”，精神上受到了很大的威胁。
    真理是不容辩驳的，事实是不容抹煞的，不管美国政府如何隐瞒和阻挠，我的丈夫——廖山涛回国的正义要求是谁也不能歪曲的！
    是谁长期地拆散我的幸福家庭？美国政府应该负这个责任。因此，我坚决地要求政府在日内瓦会议上向美国政府提出，指名放我的丈夫回来。同时，也把所有像山涛一样到美国留学的中国留学生放回来，让他们和他们久别的亲爱的父母、妻子和儿女团圆，让他们回到繁荣富强的祖国的幸福的怀抱里来。

    蒋云皋的未婚妻王惟善的来信
    我的未婚夫蒋云皋1948年到美国留学，在印第安纳州立大学学电机，毕业后在俄亥俄州坦顿市电气研究所工作。自1952年起，他就竭力设法回国，但是由于美国政府的阻挠，一直到今天还不能回到他日夜思念的祖国，同时，也使得云皋和我两人分别8年长期无法团聚。
    蒋云皋是迫切要求回国的。他在1952年8月的来信中曾说：“我现在犹如一个流浪的孩子，想投入母亲的怀抱里。祖国——这伟大的母亲使我向往。”在另一封信中说：“见到祖国欣欣向荣的消息，心中有说不出的喜悦”。
    为了要回到祖国，他想了许多办法，但是，都由于美国政府的阻挠而无法实现回国的愿望。1953年3月他来信说：“留在此间，一点没有自由。但等脱离这鸟笼即可远走高飞了。现在的问题是在这鸟笼里，必须处处留神，有小问题不注意，就难办了”。他在另一封信中愤慨地说，“他们虽号称‘自由’但‘自由’在那里？”
    由于蒋云皋一贯争取返国的行动和迫切设法回到祖国服务的心情，使他遭到了许许多多的迫害。1953年8月间的一封来信说：“有一件要紧事情告诉你，近数月来有几位我以前的同事同学写信来说，有特务人员到他们那里去调查我的情况，叫我一切注意”而同时，美国移民局又威胁他申请在美永久居住。更为严重的，1953年12月他突然给我在香港的一位朋友一封短信，信上说“这里环境不好，请你立即打一电报给王小姐，请她千万不要写信来，一俟情形好转我当通知她……”。从这封信里，可以看出由于他积极争取回国而遭到美国政府迫害时的苦痛心情，最后剥夺了他的通信自由。
    云皋已经有两年没有音讯了，而距中美大使级会谈有关双方平民回国问题达成协议也快满5个月了；可是，云皋现在在何处？为什么还没有他的讯息？为什么他还没有回到他所向往的祖国怀抱？我痛恨美国政府这种破坏别人家庭幸福的残暴行为。同时，我请求政府在日内瓦中美大使级会议上，要美方交代蒋云皋的下落，并且负责迅速让他安全回国使我们团聚。

    卞霞西父亲卞邑的来信
    我年已70岁，曾在铁路服务，现退休养老。我的儿子卞霞西在1944年到美国费城威垦宁工厂实习，后来又在该厂担任工程师。他自出国后，经常来信。1950年8月曾来信说：“一俟与该厂所订之合同在下年初期满后拟即回国”。以后，我连接寄去两封信，催他早日回来，但既未得到回信，而且音讯从此断绝，至今已有五载。自日内瓦中美两国大使级会议关于两国平民回国问题达成协议以来，家中无时无刻不在盼望能够早日得到他的消息，但依然全无音信。显然，因为他是学航空工程的，一定受到美国政府的阻挠、威胁和迫害。事情很清楚，美国政府一味抵赖扯谎，决不会老老实实遵守关于遣返平民的协议。因此我要求政府在日内瓦中美大使级会议上，向美国政府指名要回我的儿子，并使所有欲归不得的留美学生和侨民都能早日回到祖国怀抱，参加祖国建设并和家人团聚。

    周文德妻子蒋恩善的来信
    我的丈夫周文德1947年去美国，先在宾夕法尼亚大学水利系念书，得硕士学位后，1949年转入伊利诺斯大学，1950年得博士学位。即在原校土木系担任副教授，至今已有5年。在这段时间内，常有来信，信中表示渴望回国。但由于美国政府无理扣留，深感苦痛。曾在1952年5月来信说，他早已接到美国当局通知，不准他离开美国。最近3年来汇款回国也被禁止，曾来信说，如被查出后，须罚款监禁。现在中美大使级会议有关双方平民回国问题达成协议已有数月，但是我的丈夫仍然不能回来。因此，我坚决抗议美国政府这种不履行协议和违反人道的卑鄙行为。我要求政府协助，使我的丈夫和我国在美留学生能早日返回祖国参加社会主义建设，和家人团聚。这对他们自己前途也是远大而灿烂的。
                      上海　蒋恩善
    于世正父亲于省吾的来信
    我的长子于世正同儿媳翟雅明，1945年到美国进衣阿华大学读书。世正学的是高等统计学和工业管理，雅明学的是图书馆学。世正在1953年得博士学位。他在芝加哥大学实习3个月后，曾向美国当局申请回国，但被拒绝。世正不得已接受了密执安大学副教授的职务，以便等待机会回国。去年中美大使级会议对双方平民回国问题达成协议后，我连续去信催他们夫妇回国，但第一次回信对回国事一字不提。第二次复信只隐约其词露出“家人团聚”四字。这不能不使人认为他们是在美国当局阻挠下无法表达和实现早日回国的愿望。现在距中美双方平民回国问题达成协议已有5个多月，但美国当局对履行协议毫无诚意，并继续对留美中国学生进行种种限制和威胁，使他们要求回国的正当愿望无法实现，这是一种严重妨碍他人自由和违反人道主义的横暴行为。
    我现在是东北人民大学历史系教授，但年已61岁，和我儿子儿媳分别已达11年之久，因此我无时无刻不在盼望他们早日归来。因此，请求政府通过中美大使级会谈，要求美国政府彻底履行平民回国协议，让我的孩子们和其他留美学生能早日返回祖国，和家人团聚，并为祖国的社会主义建设贡献出他们的力量。
                      长春　于省吾
    沈垚姐姐沈玨的来信
    我的妹妹沈垚，1935年在前燕京大学毕业，1936年去美，入密尔士学院读文学，毕业后，再入密执安大学读语言学，学成后即留校任教。1948年曾表示在教书合同期满后即行归来。谁知等到合同期满，由于美国政府的阻挠，因此欲归不得。
    几年来她每月都有来信，词句中流露出苦闷情绪。在中美大使级会谈对双方平民归国问题达成协议后，来信提及归国问题，说归国心切。去年春天曾一再设法，但没有成功。现在，我除去信要她根据会谈协议再向美国政府提出归国要求外，我请求政府协助，要美国政府放她回国。
