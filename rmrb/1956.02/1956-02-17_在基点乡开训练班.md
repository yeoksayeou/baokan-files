Training Class Held in Jidian Township

After Pizhou County, Jiangsu Province, basically completed the semi-socialist cooperativization throughout the county, the county party committee began to lead the primary cooperatives with mature conditions to transition to advanced cooperatives. In order to gain experience, a completely socialist "Lighthouse" cooperative was first established in Jidian Township - Yunhe Township; after the cooperative was built, the experience was summarized on the spot. In addition to printing and distributing these experiences to various districts, the county party committee immediately held an advanced cooperative cadre training class in the "Lighthouse" cooperative, drawing more than 400 cadres from various districts and townships who were leading the establishment of cooperatives and cooperative cadres who were preparing to transfer to advanced cooperatives for training, systematically imparting the experience and methods of the "Lighthouse" cooperative in dealing with various specific problems during the transition. Previously, the county party committee held training classes in the county party committee's location, and the trainees could only listen but not see; now, the training class is set up in Jidian Township, and the participants can not only hear the lectures but also conduct on-the-spot visits. This practice has been welcomed by the staff of various townships.

    在基点乡开训练班
    江苏省邳县在全县基本上完成半社会主义合作化以后，县委就着手领导条件成熟的初级社向高级社过渡。为了取得经验，先在基点乡——运河乡试办了一个完全社会主义性质的“灯塔”社；在社建成之后，就地总结了经验。县委除了把这些经验印发给各区外，并且立即在“灯塔”社举办了一个高级社骨干训练班，抽调各区、乡领导建社的干部和正在筹备转高级社的社干部400多人进行训练，系统地传授了“灯塔”社转社过程中处理各项具体问题的经验和办法。以前，县委办训练班都是在县委所在地举办，受训练的人只能听不能看；现在把训练班设在基点乡，参加训练班的人不但能听到传授，还能进行实地参观访问。这种做法受到了各乡工作人员的欢迎。
