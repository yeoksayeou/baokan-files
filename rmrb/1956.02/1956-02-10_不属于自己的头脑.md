    A Brain That Doesn't Belong to Itself
    If American bourgeois journalists still have what is called a brain, then whether this brain belongs to them is a very big question.
    The United Press reported from Hong Kong that Liu Yongming, a Chinese student who had been held in a mental hospital by the American government for several years, had returned to his motherland, saying that Liu Yongming was "lured to Communist China by his wife."
    In the eyes of the United Press and its master, the U.S. State Department, which have always promoted America's "humanitarianism," the feelings between husband and wife, the feelings between parents and children, and the individual's feelings for the motherland are nothing, and are "temptations" that Chinese students in the United States should abandon.
    According to them, it seems that only Liu Yongming's imprisonment in an American mental hospital for several years, the continuous stalking and persecution of Liu Yongming by American agents, and the difficulties Liu Yongming encountered in Hong Kong are not "temptations," but are for Liu Yongming's so-called "personal freedom" and "personal dignity."
    However, Liu Yongming himself knows very well who is trying to "lure" him and where he is being "lured" to. The whole world knows this too. Even the United Press itself, doesn't it know this very well?
    The United Press is worried that Liu Yongming's return to his motherland will reveal to the world the truth about the U.S. government's obstruction of Liu Yongming's return. Therefore, it preemptively labeled this truth as a "lie" and asserted that "no one can verify the Communists' lies."
    But wait, the American side already has a witness. This is an American so-called "diplomatic official" in Hong Kong. According to the United Press, this American, who undoubtedly worked hard for Liu Yongming, said disappointedly, "This time we lost to the Communists."
    There is probably no better way to illustrate how the U.S. government sacrificed the personal happiness of Chinese students as a tool for its "Cold War" than this statement. Since the United Press reporter reported this statement, it shows that even in that thing called his brain, he cannot help but recognize who is "luring" Liu Yongming to betray his motherland. The reason why he insisted on creating the absurd theory that Liu Yongming's wife "lured" Liu Yongming back to his motherland is simply because this brain does not belong to himself, but to the U.S. State Department.

### 不属于自己的头脑

    不属于自己的头脑
    如果说美国的资产阶级新闻记者还有所谓头脑的话，那末这个头脑究竟是不是属于他自己还是个很大的疑问。
    合众社从香港报道被美国政府在精神病院里关了几年的中国留学生刘永铭回到祖国的消息说，刘永铭“被他的妻子引诱到了共产党中国”。
    在一向宣传美国的“人道主义”的合众社和它的主子美国国务院看来，夫妻之间的感情，父母子女之间的感情，个人对于祖国的感情，都算不得什么，都是在美国的中国留学生应该加以摒弃的“诱惑”。
    照它们说来，似乎只有刘永铭在美国精神病院里的几年囚禁，美国特务人员对刘永铭的一路钉梢和迫害，以及刘永铭在香港遭遇到的留难，才不是“引诱”，才是为了刘永铭的所谓“个人自由”和“个人尊严”。
    但是，刘永铭自己很清楚，究竟是谁在想尽办法“引诱”他，并且要把他“引诱”到哪里去。全世界也都清楚这一点。就是合众社自己，难道不也是知道得很清楚的吗？
    合众社担心刘永铭回到祖国，就将使美国政府阻挠刘永铭回国的真相大白于天下。因此它预先就给这个真相贴上了“谎言”的签条，并且断言说，“谁也不能证实共产党人的谎言。”
    可是，且慢，美国方面的证明人都已经有了。这是美国在香港的一位所谓“外交官员”。据合众社说，这位无疑曾经为了刘永铭忙得满头大汗的美国人失望地说，“这一回输给共产党人了。”
    要找到比这句话更能说明美国政府怎样把中国留学生的个人幸福当作它进行“冷战”的牺牲品，大概是没有的了。合众社记者既然报道了这句话，这就表明就是在他的那个被称为头脑的东西里，也已经不能不认识到究竟是谁在“引诱”刘永铭背叛祖国。他之所以硬要制造出所谓刘永铭的妻子“引诱”刘永铭回到祖国的荒唐论调，只不过是因为这个头脑不属于他自己，而是属于美国国务院的罢了。　（江）
