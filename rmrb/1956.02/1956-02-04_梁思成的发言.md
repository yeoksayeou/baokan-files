Comrades Chairman, Committee Members:

In the past few months of historic transformation, witnessing the great victories achieved by the motherland in socialist construction, as an intellectual and a technical professional, I have felt boundless excitement, realizing the magnitude and glory of our tasks, and also their immense arduousness. After participating in the discussion of the draft charter of agricultural cooperatives, I further participated in the discussion of the outline for agricultural development, and attended the Supreme State Council meeting on January 25 as a non-voting delegate. This made me even more aware of the significant responsibility that we intellectuals bear in all aspects of the motherland's construction. At this meeting, after listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, reading his report on the issue of intellectuals at the CPC Central Committee meeting, and listening to the reports of the four vice-chairmen and Committee Member Chen Boda, in addition to fully agreeing with and supporting them, I felt indescribable encouragement, courage, strength, and confidence. The Party has put forward tremendous and glorious tasks for us intellectuals, while at the same time caring for us in every possible way. I can only express my heartfelt gratitude to the Party.

I am a technical and scientific worker who has made serious mistakes in my work. Here, I would like to talk about my personal understanding of the Party's policy of "unity, education, and transformation," and how I made serious mistakes in my academic thinking and work, and how the Party helped me recognize my mistakes. This is my self-criticism, my expression of gratitude to the Party, and also my letter of determination.

In the past 20 years, I have written many survey reports on Chinese architecture, organized ancient books, and authored articles and books on Chinese architectural history, urban planning, and creative theories. The consistent characteristics of these articles and theories are subjective idealism and metaphysics; the creative theories I put forward are formalism and revivalism. As soon as Beijing was liberated, the Party gave me the greatest trust, and in May 1949, I was allowed to participate in the capital's planning work. In the seven years since then, I have wholeheartedly supported all the Party's political, economic, and cultural policies, and I have shouted "Long live!" for every great achievement of the motherland in socialist transformation and construction. However, in urban planning and architectural design, I have consistently opposed the Party, actively disseminated my erroneous theories, and implemented them in Beijing's urban planning, architectural review, and teaching. From the capital, it spread to the whole country, causing a foul wind of formalism and revivalism to blow through the architectural community, wasting a large amount of construction funds accumulated by workers and peasants with their blood and sweat, hindering the socialist construction of the motherland, and at the same time poisoning hundreds of young people - the reserve force of the new China's architects.

I did not recognize my own mistakes for a long time. This was because my thoughts and feelings retained a strong feudal ruling class "elegant taste" and "nostalgia for the past," wanting to build the people's capital into a brand-new "fake antique," wanting to force the broad masses of workers and peasants to accept this "taste," and let them live in a city that "retains Beijing's original 'urban style'." My understanding of architecture was also extremely lacking in economic, mass, and revolutionary perspectives. Also, since liberation, I have held many part-time jobs and participated in many social activities, and I have not been able to study systematically and well, so my level of Marxism-Leninism has not been improved, my thinking methods are wrong, and I have unilaterally emphasized the artistic nature of architecture. I thought I was right, that the Party did not understand architecture, so I separated myself from the Party, separated myself from the masses, and embarked on the wrong path.

As early as 1951, the Party had already discerned my bias, and for five years continuously enlightened me, educated me, guided me, and repeatedly explained to me the basic principles of socialist construction, and explained to me the correct policy of "suitability, economy, and attention to aesthetics where possible." But due to the above reasons, I stubbornly persisted in my mistakes, argued endlessly, and confronted the Party. It was not until the beginning of last year, when the Ministry of Construction Engineering convened a national design and construction conference, at which the formalism and revivalism bias in architectural design was severely criticized, and astonishing waste figures were cited, that I was awakened from my dream. Unfortunately, I spent the whole of last year in hospitals and sanatoriums, and was unable to participate in that conference and the subsequent architectural ideological criticism and study in various design units and schools. But the Party did not forget me. At the end of last year, when my health - also under the Party's care - recovered, I was vigorously helped again, and several symposiums were organized for me. Only then did I begin to understand why my architectural theory was wrong, and I dug out its roots.

The reason why I embarked on the wrong path is because my erroneous standpoints, viewpoints, and methods made me deviate from the leadership of the Party, deviate from the masses, take the wrong path, bring losses to the people, and create obstacles to the construction of the motherland. Only then did I realize that technology must never be separated from the leadership of the Party, and that separation from the Party is bound to lead to mistakes. Because our Party is the vanguard of the working class, it is the Party that grasps the universally applicable Marxist-Leninism - the ideological method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and strives for the interests of all working people and for the socialist construction of the motherland, so the Party led 600 million people to liberate themselves, and also led us to win one victory after another on the fronts of social transformation, economic and cultural construction. Without the leadership of the Party, all these brilliant achievements would be inconceivable. The idea of "the Party leads politics, experts lead technology" is completely wrong. The Party's leadership over technology is beyond doubt.

Separation from the leadership of the Party is bound to lead to mistakes and bring losses to the people. I myself am a living proof; for myself, it is a painful lesson.

At this meeting, I received another profound education and tremendous encouragement.

I sincerely thank the Party for treating my serious physical illness and also treating my serious ideological illness. The Party has done everything possible to save me and treat me. I believe I have been saved, or at least it can be said that my "condition" has definitely improved. The Party is our guide, leading me back from the lost path to the bright road. I want to study hard like a student just entering the school gate: study Marxism-Leninism, conduct self-education, improve my level, re-understand architecture, re-understand heritage; restart my work, contribute my strength, and expand our team through teaching. I want to unite all architects, engineers, artists, and comrades engaged in architectural work. I want to wage a resolute and merciless struggle against the bourgeois idealistic old self. I must transform myself into a red expert, a red teacher.

Although my health is not good, I have confidence that under the care and encouragement of the Party, I can still work for at least 25 years, striving to work at least until the day I am 80 years old. In this not very short period, I want to dedicate everything I have to the cause of the Party - the great cause of communism. I will never take another step away from our Party!

    梁思成的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在过去几个月历史性转变的日子里，看着祖国在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大胜利，作为一个知识分子，一个技术人员，我已感到无比兴奋，感到我们任务之重大和光荣，也感到它的无比艰巨。在参加讨论了农业合作社章程草案后，我又参加讨论了农业发展纲要，并列席了1月25日的最高国务会议，我就更体会到我们知识分子在祖国一切建设中所负的重大责任。在这次会议中，听了周恩来主席的政治报告，同时又读了他在中共中央会议上关于知识分子问题的报告，和听了四位副主席和陈伯达委员的报告后，除了完全同意和拥护外，更感到说不出的鼓舞、勇气、力量和信心。党对我们知识分子提出了巨大光荣的任务，同时对我们又关怀到无微不至。对于党，我惟有衷心的感激。
    我是一个在工作中犯了严重错误的技术科学工作者，在这里，我愿意谈谈我对于党的“团结、教育、改造”政策的切身的体会，谈谈我在学术思想上和工作中怎样犯了严重错误，党怎样帮助我认识了自己的错误。这是我的检讨，也是对党的感谢词，也是我的决心书。
    过去20余年中我写了许多关于中国建筑的调查报告、整理古籍、中国建筑历史、都市规划和创作理论的文章和专书。这些文章和理论的一贯特征就是主观唯心主义、形而上学的；我所提出的创作理论是形式主义、复古主义的。北京一解放，党就给了我最大的信任，在1949年5月就让我参加了首都的规划工作。7年以来，我对于党的一切政治、经济、文化的政策莫不衷心拥护，对于祖国在社会主义改造和建设上的每一伟大成就莫不为之三呼万岁。但在都市规划和建筑设计上，我却一贯地与党对抗，积极传播我的错误理论，并把它贯彻到北京市的都市规划、建筑审查和教学中去，由首都影响到全国，使得建筑界中刮起了一阵乌烟瘴气的形式主义、复古主义的歪风，浪费了大量工人农民以血汗积累起来的建设资金，阻碍了祖国的社会主义建设，同时还毒害了数以百计的青年——新中国的建筑师队伍的后备军。
    我对自己的错误是长期没有认识的。这是由于我的思想感情中存留着浓厚的封建统治阶级的“雅趣”和“思古幽情”，想把人民的首都建设成一件崭新的“假古董”，想强迫广大工人农民群众接受这种“趣味”，让他们住在一个“保持着北京原有的‘城市风格’”的城市里。我对于建筑的认识又极端缺乏经济观点，群众观点，革命观点。又由于解放以来，我兼职多、社会活动多，没有得系统地、好好地学习，所以我的马克思列宁主义水平不得提高，思想方法错误，片面地强调了建筑的艺术性。我以为自己是正确的，党是不懂建筑的，因而脱离了党，脱离了群众，走上错误的道路。
    远在1951年，党就洞悉了我的偏向，五年来不断地启发我，教育我，开导我，反复为我阐述社会主义建设的基本原则，为我讲解“适用，经济，在可能条件下注意美观”的正确方针。但由于上述原因，我顽固地坚持错误，争辩不休，与党对抗。直至去年年初，建筑工程部召开了全国设计施工会议，在会议上严正地批判了建筑设计中形式主义、复古主义的偏向，并举出了惊人的浪费数字，这才使我从梦中惊醒。不幸，去年整年我都在医院和休养所中度过，未得参加那次会议和会后各设计单位和学校的建筑思想批判学习。但是党并没有忘记我。到去年年底，当我的健康——也是在党的关怀下——恢复了以后，又大力帮助我，为我组织了几次座谈讨论会。这样我才初步认识了我的建筑理论为什么是错误的，并挖出了它的根源。
    我之所以走上错误的道路是因为我的错误的立场、观点、方法使我脱离了党的领导，脱离了群众，走了错误的道路，为人民带来了损失，造成了祖国建设的障碍。这才使我体会到技术是绝对不能脱离党的领导的，脱离了党就必然要犯错误。因为我们的党是工人阶级的先锋队，它是掌握放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义——辩证唯物主义、历史唯物主义的思想方法，为全体劳动人民的利益，为祖国的社会主义建设而奋斗的党，所以党领导六亿人民解放了自己，又领导着我们在社会改造、经济和文化建设的战线上赢得了一个接着一个的胜利。没有党的领导，这一切光辉成就是不可思议的。“党领导政治、专家领导技术”的思想是完全错误的。党对技术的领导是丝毫无容置疑的。
    脱离了党的领导，就必然犯错误，为人民带来损失，我自己就是一个活生生的证明；对于我自己，则是一次沉痛的教训。
    在这次会议中，我又得到一次深刻的教育，一次莫大的鼓舞。
    衷心地感谢党，在给我医治了身体的重病之后，又为我医治思想上的严重病症。党尽了一切可能来救我、治我。我相信我已得救，至少可以说“病情”是肯定地好转了。党是我们的带路人，把我从迷途中引回到光明的康庄大道上来了。我要像一个初进学校大门的学生一样，努力学习：学习马克思列宁主义，进行自我教育，提高自己的水平，重新认识建筑，重新认识遗产；重新开始我的工作，贡献自己的力量，并通过教学工作，扩大我们的队伍。我要团结所有的建筑师、工程师、艺术家和从事建筑工作的同志们。我要和那个资产阶级唯心主义的故我进行坚决无情的斗争。我一定要把自己改造成为一个红色专家，红色教师。
    我的身体虽然不好，但我有信心，在党的关怀和鼓舞下，我至少还可以工作25年，争取至少工作到我80岁的那天。在这不算很短的期间，我要把我的一切献给党的事业——伟大的共产主义事业。我永远一步也不再离开我们的党！
