The 1956 "March 8" International Women's Day is approaching. This year's "March 8" falls precisely during the vigorous development of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country; it also coincides with a period when international peace forces and anti-colonialist forces have achieved broad development, and the idea of peaceful coexistence has achieved a great victory.

In recent years, the unity of women from all strata and nationalities across the country has been further expanded and strengthened. Women have played a significant role in the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland, and this role is growing daily. Women's political awareness and organizational skills have generally improved to varying degrees. Women's status in political, economic, cultural, social, family, and other aspects has also significantly improved and changed. Especially in recent months, the rapid and magnificent high tide of socialist revolution that has swept across the country has given women infinite encouragement. Facts have proven that every victory in socialist construction and socialist transformation is a victory for the complete liberation of women.

Therefore, commemorating this year's "March 8" should, based on the current new situation, more broadly mobilize women across the country to further unleash their socialist enthusiasm and strive to do more, faster, better, and more economical work. Mobilize women workers and women in various production and work positions to actively participate in labor competitions, and strive to complete and over fulfill the first five-year plan for national economic construction ahead of schedule; mobilize and encourage the vast rural working women to strive to complete agricultural collectivization and agricultural production increase tasks; mobilize all intellectual women to more actively contribute scientific, cultural, and technical knowledge to the great construction cause of the motherland; mobilize young women across the country to study hard, do good work, and play a vanguard role in various positions; mobilize all family members of workers, handicraftsmen, industrialists and businessmen, and other housewives to further improve their socialist awareness and strive to achieve "five goods" -- good unity and mutual assistance among family and neighbors, good arrangement of family life, good education of children, good encouragement of relatives to produce, work, and study, and good self-study -- thereby playing the role of family members in socialist construction and socialist transformation. Mobilize women across the country to continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, to further strive for the relaxation of international tensions, to strive for the early peaceful liberation of Taiwan, to defend Asian and world peace, and to enhance understanding and friendship with women from all countries, and to make greater contributions to the rights of women and children. And take the above practical actions to welcome and support the convening of the World Women Workers' Conference.

According to this spirit, the commemorative activities for this year's "March 8" must be carried out warmly, widely, and deeply. It is required to use various commemorative activities to further unleash the enthusiasm of the broad masses of women for loving socialism and strive to become socialist construction activists and model figures.

In order to achieve the above objectives, we recommend that the following main activities be carried out in various places:

(1) According to the actual situation in various places, various commemorative meetings should be jointly convened by relevant units or individually around "March 8". In addition to convening mass rallies of women, various large or small commemorative meetings can also be held separately and widely from the provincial and municipal levels to the grassroots levels, such as meetings of female workers or activists of workers' families, meetings of all female members or activists of agricultural cooperatives, get-togethers of workers and peasants, meetings of female members of handicraft cooperatives or families of handicraftsmen, meetings of representatives of intellectual women or families of senior intellectuals, meetings of families of industrialists and businessmen or representatives of female industrialists and businessmen, mothers' meetings, housewives' meetings, etc. It is required to ensure that women from all strata and industries can participate in commemorative activities.

(2) In all commemorative meetings, attention should be paid to commending activists and model figures among local women, and women from all strata and industries should be called upon to actively strive to become activists and model figures in socialist construction.

(3) In all commemorative meetings, internationalist education should be carried out in conjunction with the current situation. In commemorative meetings in major and medium-sized cities and industrial cities, publicity should also be carried out in conjunction with the convening of the World Women Workers' Conference.

(4) It is required that local newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and other publicity organizations mobilize all publicity tools to carry out widespread publicity and reports based on the requirements and content of this year's "March 8" commemoration. And it is required that publicity and reports can be carried out more centrally and continuously in the 10 days before and after "March 8".

Finally, it is hoped that the spirit and content of this joint notice will be used by the Women's Federation to jointly consult with relevant groups and departments to jointly prepare for the commemorative activities for this year's "March 8". In order to achieve the goal of further strengthening the regular contact and work coordination between the Women's Federation and various people's organizations and relevant departments on the basis of this year's joint commemoration of "March 8", so as to seek a deeper and wider development of women's work.

    全国妇联等十三个单位
    关于纪念“三八”妇女节的联合通知
    1956年“三八”国际妇女节就要来到了。今年的“三八”节，正是处在国内社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业蓬勃发展的高潮时期；也正是处在国际和平力量和反殖民主义力量获得了广泛发展、和平共处的思想获得了伟大胜利的时期。
    几年来，全国各阶层、各民族妇女的团结是更加扩大更加紧密了。妇女在祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中已起了很大的作用，而且这种作用正在日益增大。妇女们的政治觉悟和组织水平，已在不同程度上普遍地有了提高。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的、家庭的各方面的地位，也都有了显著的提高和改变。尤其最近几个月来，全国迅速地、壮阔地向前发展的社会主义革命高潮，更给予妇女以无限的鼓舞。事实证明，社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的每一个胜利，都是妇女彻底解放的胜利。
    为此，纪念今年的“三八”节，应根据目前新的形势，更广泛地动员全国妇女进一步发挥社会主义积极性，为把工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省而努力。动员全国女职工及各种生产和工作岗位上的妇女，积极参加劳动竞赛，努力争取提前完成和超额完成国家经济建设的第一个五年计划；动员鼓舞广大的农村劳动妇女，为完成农业合作化和农业增产任务而奋斗；动员全体知识妇女，更积极地把科学、文化、技术知识贡献给祖国伟大的建设事业；动员全国女青年，努力学好本领，做好工作，在各种岗位上发挥突击作用；动员所有的职工家属、手工业者家属、工商业者家属以及其他家庭妇女进一步提高社会主义觉悟，努力争取做到“五好”——家庭邻里团结互助好、家庭生活安排好、教育子女好、鼓励亲人生产、工作、学习好、自己学习好——从而发挥家属在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中的作用。动员全国妇女，继续发扬爱国主义和国际主义精神，为进一步争取国际紧张局势的缓和，为争取早日和平解放台湾，为保卫亚洲和世界和平，为增进与各国妇女的了解与友谊，争取妇女、儿童的权利而作出更大的贡献。并以上述实际行动，迎接和支持世界女工会议的召开。
    据此精神，今年“三八”节的纪念活动必须热烈、广泛深入地进行。要求通过各种纪念活动，更大地发挥广大妇女群众热爱社会主义的积极性，为争取作社会主义建设积极分子、模范人物而奋斗。
    为了达到上述目的，我们建议各地进行如下的几项主要活动：
    （1）根据各地实际情况，在“三八”节前后由各有关单位联合或各自召开各种各样的纪念会。除可召开妇女群众大会外，还可从省、市直到基层，分别地、广泛地召开各种大型或小型的纪念会，如女工或职工家属积极分子会、农业合作社全体女社员或女社员积极分子会、工农妇女联欢会、手工业合作社女社员或手工业者家属会、知识妇女代表会或高级知识分子家属会、工商业者家属或女工商业者代表会、母亲会、主妇会等。要求做到使各阶层、各行业的妇女，都能参加纪念活动。
    （2）在所有的纪念会上，均应注意表扬当地妇女中的积极分子、模范人物，并号召各阶层、各行业的妇女积极争取做社会主义建设的积极分子、模范人物。
    （3）在所有的纪念会上，均应结合目前形势，进行国际主义教育。在各大中城市及工业城市的纪念会上，还应结合世界女工会议的召开进行宣传。
    （4）要求各地报刊、通讯社、广播电台及其他宣传组织动员一切宣传工具，根据今年纪念“三八”节的要求和内容，广泛进行宣传报道。并要求在“三八”节前后10天，能更集中地、连续地进行宣传报道。
    最后，望根据本联合通知的精神和内容，由妇联联合有关团体、部门共同协商，联合筹备今年“三八”节的纪念活动。以求达到在今年共同纪念“三八”节的工作基础上，进一步加强妇联与各人民团体和有关部门之间的经常联系和工作上的配合，从而求得更深入、更广泛地开展妇女工作。
