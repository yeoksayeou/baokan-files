Observer Commentary:

    Normalizing relations between China and Japan is the common desire of the people of both countries, and therefore it is a primary issue that the governments of both countries need to strive to resolve. The Chinese government has taken many concrete steps to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, but the Japanese government has not only failed to make any corresponding efforts but has also continuously obstructed them. Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru’s statement on February 3 at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives that "the Japanese government has never received any formal proposal from Communist China requesting the restoration of diplomatic relations" is an attempt to obscure the efforts made by the Chinese government and conceal the Japanese government's passive attitude on the issue of normalizing Sino-Japanese relations.

    The communiqué issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 11 regarding China's proposal that the Chinese and Japanese governments hold negotiations to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, published all the correspondence between the two governments on this issue since July 15, 1955. This communiqué irrefutably illustrates the truth of the matter and powerfully exposes Shigemitsu's statement that attempts to obscure the facts. These documents show that as early as August 17 of last year, the Chinese Consul-General in Geneva, in a letter to the Japanese Consul-General in Geneva, proposed that the Chinese and Japanese governments send delegations to hold talks. However, Tadatsuke Keiichi, acting on the instructions of the Japanese government, evaded answering this question in two letters to the Chinese Consul-General in Geneva on August 29 and October 20 of last year. On November 4 of last year, the Chinese government made a second proposal through the same channel, expressing its willingness to hold discussions with a delegation sent by the Japanese government on the issue of promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, but the Japanese government has not responded to date. The Japanese government has not responded to the two negotiation proposals put forward by the Chinese government. Now, when Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai once again suggested on January 30 this year that the Chinese and Japanese governments hold discussions on the issue of promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, Shigemitsu came out on February 3 and said that this suggestion had not been put forward through "proper channels." This inconsistent and contradictory statement by Shigemitsu, apart from indicating that he intends to continue to obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, cannot be interpreted in any other way.

    The communiqué also shows that since July 15 of last year, the Japanese government has been fundamentally unwilling to seek solutions to many major issues between China and Japan that concern the interests of the people of both countries. For example, the issue of developing normal trade between China and Japan, the issue of promoting mutual exchanges between the people of China and Japan, and the issue of properly handling the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese and Japanese nationals were not mentioned at all in the Japanese side's letters. The Japanese government is only harping on the so-called issue of the return of Japanese nationals, which has already been properly resolved by people's organizations of China and Japan. The truth is that there were originally only 35,000 Japanese nationals in China, and more than 29,000 of them who wanted to return to their country have already returned to Japan. Only 6,000 remain in China because they have expressed their desire to reside in China for the long term or temporarily. Nevertheless, the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that if any Japanese nationals change their minds and want to return to Japan, the Chinese government will continue to assist them in returning. In fact, not long ago, on December 14, 1955, another group of Japanese nationals returned to Japan. As for the issue of handling Japanese war criminals, this is a matter within the scope of Chinese sovereignty and should be handled in accordance with Chinese law. The Japanese government has no right to interfere. The Japanese government insists that there are still so-called 40,000 Japanese people whose whereabouts are unknown in China, which is completely unfounded. Even so, based on humanitarian principles, the Chinese government still stated that the Chinese Red Cross Society is willing to investigate the whereabouts of individual Japanese people as much as possible, as long as the Japanese side can provide specific materials. The facts prove that the Japanese government deliberately raises the issue of handling war criminals and the issue of so-called missing Japanese people, obviously because it cannot give a clear explanation to the Japanese people who lost their loved ones in the long war of aggression, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the Japanese people. It attempts to use this trick to shift the responsibility it should bear onto the Chinese people in order to arouse dissatisfaction among the Japanese people towards the Chinese people, thereby hindering the development of friendly relations between the people of China and Japan.

    Now that the truth is clear, China's concrete proposals on promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations are not only reasonable but also practical. The Japanese government has no excuse to continue to adopt an evasive and passive attitude towards this proposal. At the same time, all Japanese people and Japanese people of insight who care about the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations should also work to change this situation.

### 重光葵不能抹煞事实

    重光葵不能抹煞事实
    中日两国关系正常化是两国人民的共同愿望，因此也是中日两国政府需要努力求得解决的首要问题。我国政府为了促进中日两国关系的正常化，曾经采取了许多具体步骤，而日本政府不仅没有作过任何相应的努力，反而不断进行阻挠。日本外务相重光葵2月3日在日本众议院外务委员会的会议上竟然说，“日本政府从来没有从共产党中国接到任何要求恢复外交关系的正式建议”，就是企图抹煞我国政府所作的努力，掩饰日本政府在中日关系正常化问题上所采取的消极态度。
    我国外交部2月11日发表的关于中国建议中日两国政府促进中日关系正常化问题进行谈判的公报，公布了自1955年7月15日以来中日两国政府关于这个问题的全部来往文件。这个公报无可辩驳地说明了事实的真相，有力地揭穿了重光葵这种抹煞事实的说法。这些文件说明，早在去年8月17日，我国驻日内瓦总领事在给日本驻日内瓦总领事的信中，就提出了中日两国政府派遣代表团举行会谈的建议。可是，田付景一奉日本政府之命在去年8月29日和10月20日两次致我国驻日内瓦总领事的信中，对这个问题都规避不作答复。去年11月4日，我国政府经过同样的途径第二次提出建议，表示愿意同日本政府派遣的代表团就促进中日两国关系正常化问题进行商谈，而日本政府至今未作任何答复。日本政府对我国政府两次提出谈判的建议不予答复。现在，我国周恩来总理于今年1月30日再次建议中日两国政府就促进中日关系正常化的问题进行商谈的时候，重光葵在2月3日却出来说什么这个建议并没有通过“正当途径”提出过。重光葵这种不符事实和充满矛盾的说法，除了说明他要在中日两国关系正常化问题上继续采取阻挠态度以外，是不可能作任何别的解释的。
    这个公报还说明，从去年7月15日以来，日本政府根本不愿意就中日两国之间许多有关两国人民利益的重大问题寻求解决办法。例如发展中日两国正常贸易问题，促进中日两国人民的互相往来问题，妥善处理中日两国侨民的正当权益问题，在日方的信件中完全没有提到。日本政府只是在早已由中日两国人民团体妥善解决了的所谓日本侨民回国问题上进行纠缠。事情的真相是，在中国的日侨原来就只有35，000人，愿意回国的29，000余名日侨都已回到日本，早就只有6，000人还留居在中国，这是因为他们表示要长期或暂时留居中国。虽然如此，我国政府还是一再声明，如有日本侨民改变主意想回到日本，我国政府将继续协助他们回去。事实上不久以前，即1955年12月14日又有一批日侨回到了日本。至于日本战犯的处理问题，这是中国主权范围以内的事情，应该依照中国的法律处理，日本政府无权过问。日本政府硬说在中国还有所谓下落不明的4万日本人，这是丝毫没有根据的。虽然这样，我国政府根据人道的原则，依然表示中国红十字会还愿意对个别日本人的下落问题尽可能地予以调查，只要日本方面能提出具体的材料。事实证明，日本政府故意提出战犯处理问题和所谓下落不明的日本人问题，显然是它无法向那些在长期侵略战争中失去亲人的日本人民作出明确的交代，引起了日本人民对它的不满；它企图用这种伎俩把它自己应负的责任推到中国人民的身上，以引起日本人民对中国人民的不满，从而阻挠中日两国人民之间友好关系的发展。
    现在，事实的真相已经清楚，中国方面关于促进中日关系正常化的具体建议，不仅是入情入理的，而且也是切实可行的。日本政府没有任何借口继续对这个建议采取规避的消极态度。同时，一切关心中日关系正常化的日本人民和日本有识之士也应努力改变这种状况。
