Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a public communiqué on February 11, 1956, regarding the Chinese government's proposal for negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese governments on promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. The full text is as follows:

On January 30, 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai, in his political report to the Second Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, once again suggested that the Chinese and Japanese governments should discuss the issue of promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. The report also mentioned that the Chinese government had twice suggested to the Japanese government on August 17 and November 4, 1955, that the two governments should discuss this issue, but had not received a response from the Japanese government. However, according to a Tokyo dispatch from Kyodo News Agency on February 3, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu surprisingly denied that the Japanese government had ever received any such proposal from the Chinese government, which is incomprehensible. In order to clarify the truth, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China hereby publishes all the correspondence between the Chinese and Japanese governments on this issue since July 15, 1955, as follows:

	(1) July 15, 1955, Tadatsuke Kageichi, Japanese Consul General
	in Geneva, to Mr. Shen Ping, Consul General of the People's
	Republic of China in Geneva:
	
	Upon instructions from my government, I have the honor to request you to convey to your government my government's requests regarding the repatriation of Japanese nationals, as follows:
		(1) Thanks to the assistance of the Chinese Red Cross, the repatriation of Japanese nationals from mainland China has progressed to a considerable extent. However, this repatriation work has been suspended since March of this year.
		(2) According to the information provided by a group of Chinese Red Cross officials led by Madame Li Dequan who visited Japan in November 1954, 1,069 Japanese were being detained as war criminals by the government of the People's Republic of China, and approximately 8,000 Japanese nationals remained on mainland China. Since then, 2,297 people have been repatriated in three batches. Therefore, there should currently be approximately 6,000 people remaining on mainland China. This number is consistent with the results of the Japanese government's investigations. However, there are an additional 40,000 who were apparently in mainland China, but their whereabouts or deaths have never been confirmed.
		(3) Now that the war has ended for ten years, those detained naturally strongly desire to return home. At the same time, letters from those not detained indicate that many of them also wish to return. In addition, the families of those whose fate is unknown are extremely eager to learn any news regarding their fate.
		(4) The Japanese government most urgently hopes that the government of the People's Republic of China will consider this situation as a humanitarian matter and take measures to release and repatriate those detained, inform the Japanese government of the names and last known situations of those not yet repatriated, help those who wish to return to do so, and make every effort to ascertain the situation of those whose whereabouts are unknown, and even if some of them have died, return their remains so that their families can be promptly notified. The Japanese government is prepared to cooperate with the government of the People's Republic of China, providing available materials or any possible means to facilitate the resolution of various difficulties.
		(5) There are no diplomatic relations between the Japanese government, and the government of the People's Republic of China. However, regardless of whether there are diplomatic relations, the Japanese government hopes that the government of the People's Republic of China will do its utmost in this matter, as it is purely a humanitarian issue. Sir, I have the honor to be your faithful servant.

	(2) August 17, 1955, Shen Ping, Consul General of the People's
	Republic of China in Geneva, to Tadatsuke Kageichi, Japanese Consul
	General in Geneva:
	
	Mr. Tadatsuke Kageichi:
	I have forwarded the letter you delivered on July 15 to my government.
	
	On July 16, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued another communiqué, which included the various issues raised in your letter.
	
	Regarding your letter and the aforementioned communiqué from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on August 16. A copy of the statement is attached for your information and transmission to your government.
	
	In order to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and contribute to the continued relaxation of the international situation, the Chinese government believes that it is necessary for the Chinese and Japanese governments to hold discussions on issues such as trade between the two countries, the issue of nationals of both sides, the issue of mutual visits by the peoples of the two countries, and other major issues related to the interests of the peoples of both countries. If the Japanese government holds the same desire, the Chinese government welcomes a delegation dispatched by the Japanese government to hold talks in Beijing. I request that you convey the above suggestions of our government to the Japanese government.
	
	The Chinese government awaits the response of the Japanese government.
		The Consul General of the People's Republic of China
			Shen Ping
				August 17, 1955
		Attachment: Statement by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of
			Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
			
	On July 15,1955, the Japanese Consul General in Geneva, on behalf of the Japanese government, delivered a note to the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Geneva regarding the so-called "request for the repatriation of Japanese nationals." On July 16, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communiqué regarding the so-called "issue of withdrawing Japanese remaining in mainland China." In the note and the communiqué, the Japanese government made unfounded accusations and unilaterally unreasonable demands. In response, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement:
		
		First, regarding the issue of nationals. The government of the People's Republic of China has always provided various conveniences to Japanese nationals in China who wish to return to their country. By the end of March 1955, through the joint efforts of the Chinese Red Cross, the Japanese Red Cross, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, approximately 29,000 Japanese nationals who wished to return to their country had returned to Japan out of a total of approximately 35,000 Japanese nationals. There are now more than 6,000 Japanese nationals still residing in China who have expressed their willingness to reside in China for a long or temporary period. If any of them change their minds and apply to return to their country, the Chinese government will continue to provide various conveniences, and the Chinese Red Cross will do its best to assist. This point was agreed upon with the Japanese Red Cross and other organizations when the delegation of the Chinese Red Cross visited Japan. Now the Japanese government is making the unfounded accusation that "no further progress has been made on the issue of withdrawing nationals." On the contrary, China has tens of thousands of nationals in Japan whose legitimate rights and interests have not been properly taken care of. Their connection with their motherland and families is still being obstructed, and they do not have the convenience of returning to their country. It can be seen that on the issue of nationals between China and Japan, it is not the issue of Japanese nationals that should be negotiated and resolved, but the issue of Chinese nationals.
	
		Regarding the issue of Japanese war criminals. We have long stated that we are prepared to handle them in accordance with a lenient policy. In August 1954, we had already exempted 417 former Japanese soldiers who had committed various crimes in the war of aggression against China and in the Chinese People's Liberation War from punishment and sent them back to Japan. Later, the Chinese Red Cross notified the Japanese Red Cross of the list and information of 1,069 war criminals. The government of the People's Republic of China will handle these war criminals in accordance with Chinese legal procedures. This is a matter of Chinese sovereignty, and the Japanese government has no right to interfere.
	
		Apart from the aforementioned Japanese nationals and Japanese war criminals, we do not have any Japanese nationals whose situations are unknown. However, it is surprising that the Japanese government has raised the issue of approximately 40,000 people whose situations are unknown. Japanese militarists once drove a large number of Japanese people to participate in the war of aggression against China. Many Japanese died in China during this war, and the Japanese government has not yet notified their relatives of the exact news of some of them. It is natural and worthy of sympathy that their relatives are concerned about their whereabouts. Based on humanitarian principles, the Chinese Red Cross has reached an agreement with the Japanese Red Cross and other organizations regarding the issue of investigating the whereabouts of individual Japanese people, that is, if the Japanese Red Cross can provide specific materials, the Chinese Red Cross is willing to investigate them as much as possible. However, it should be pointed out that this is a manifestation of the Chinese people's friendship towards the Japanese people, and has nothing to do with the Japanese government's insistence that there are approximately 40,000 people whose situations are unknown on the mainland of China. More importantly, during the war of aggression against China, Japanese militarists caused the massacre of more than ten million Chinese people and the loss of millions of US dollars of Chinese public and private property, and also abducted tens of thousands of Chinese people to Japan to enslave and kill them. The Japanese government should understand that the Chinese people have the right to demand compensation for the huge losses they have suffered. Now, the Japanese government has not only not made any explanation for these situations, but has also groundlessly demanded that China explain the issue of the so-called 40,000 people, which cannot but make people suspect the motive of the Japanese government in raising this issue.
	
		Promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, in order to realize peace and friendship between China and Japan, is the common aspiration of the people of China and Japan. For more than two years, the Chinese government has repeatedly taken steps to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. The Japanese government has not only failed to make corresponding efforts, but has instead tried to use the issue of Japanese nationals returning to their country to divert public opinion in order to cover up its passivity in promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. In fact, the issue of Japanese nationals returning to their country has long been properly resolved by people's organizations of China and Japan. Even if there are still matters that need to be further processed on this issue, they can only be matters of a routine nature. However, there are indeed many major issues related to the interests of the peoples of both countries between China and Japan today. For example, developing normal trade between China and Japan, promoting mutual visits between the peoples of China and Japan, and properly handling the legitimate rights and interests of nationals of both China and Japan are all issues that need to be resolved by the governments of China and Japan. If the Japanese government is truly sincere in seeking a path to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, it should start with these issues. The Chinese government is prepared to negotiate with the Japanese government on these issues.

	(3) August 29, 1955, Tadatsuke Kageichi, Japanese Consul
	General in Geneva, to Shen Ping, Consul General of the People's
	Republic of China in Geneva:
	
	Dear Consul General:
	I wish to inform you that the letter you delivered to me on August 17, 1955, has been forwarded to my government. I am now instructed by my government to request you to convey the following to your government:
		One, the Japanese government directly requests the government of the People's Republic of China to cooperate in resolving the situation where some people are still unable to return home ten years after the end of the war. As previously stated, the Japanese government considers this purely a humanitarian issue.
		Two, regarding certain points in the statement made by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on August 16, the position of the Japanese government is as follows:
			(1) The Japanese government expresses its gratitude for the statement in the declaration that the government of the People's Republic of China will facilitate the return of the 6,000 or so Japanese nationals still on the mainland, and that the Chinese Red Cross will do its best to assist them if they apply to return to Japan. It hopes that this statement will be realized, as some of them have already requested to return. A list of some of these people has been forwarded to the Chinese Red Cross by the Japanese Red Cross and has been handed to the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Geneva. We hereby request the government of the People's Republic of China to provide assistance to them and others that the Japanese government may notify the government of the People's Republic of China in the future.
			(2) Regarding the approximately 40,000 Japanese nationals whose situations are unknown. According to investigations conducted by the Japanese government, records show that these people were on mainland China either at the end of the war or in mid-1949, after which the Japanese government has been unable to ascertain their whereabouts. Those who have returned home, those who have been sent to the Soviet Union, and those who have been confirmed dead are not included. Some of them may have died, and some may be in remote and inaccessible areas. In any case, since their families are awaiting any news about them, the Japanese government is eager to obtain information about them if the government of the People's Republic of China has any information. The Japanese government is also eager for the Chinese government to investigate their situation. As previously stated, the Japanese government is prepared to provide any materials it possesses and cooperate with this investigation.
			(3) Regarding the issue of war criminals, the Japanese government also wishes to know the charges under which they are being detained. However, the Japanese government hopes that the government of the People's Republic of China will consider this matter in a spirit of humanitarianism, release them as soon as possible, and send them back. In this regard, it may be mentioned that some countries have already released all war criminals from World War II; some countries have returned them to their home countries to serve their sentences.
			(4) The statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China also mentioned the issue of Chinese civilians residing in Japan. It may be pointed out that Chinese nationals in Japan, like any other foreign nationals, do not suffer discrimination, and they enjoy full freedom to return to their country if they wish to do so. It goes without saying that our repatriation ships have transported Chinese nationals back to their country.
		Three, the Japanese government believes that the Japanese government and the government of the People's Republic of China should first resolve the issue of the return of Japanese nationals, including war criminals. Since this issue is purely a humanitarian one, the lack of diplomatic relations between the two governments should not create difficulties in working together to resolve this issue. We sincerely request that the government of the People's Republic of China respond favorably to the Japanese government's position on this issue. Thank you for your transmission.
			Sincerely,
			Japanese Consul General Tadatsuke Kageichi
			August 29, 1955, Geneva
				
	(4) October 20, 1955, Tadatsuke Kageichi, Japanese Consul
	General in Geneva, to Shen Ping, Consul General of the People's
	Republic of China in Geneva:
	
	Dear Consul General:
	I have learned that at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the League of Red Cross Societies held in Geneva on September 28, 1955, the representative of the Red Cross Society of the People's Republic of China announced that the repatriation of approximately 200 Japanese nationals was in preparation. It is also reported that Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the People's Republic of China, recently stated to some Japanese parliamentarians who visited the People's Republic of China regarding the issue of "war criminals" that all those who are ill, elderly, or sentenced to light sentences will be sent back to their country by the end of this year. Hereby, I am now instructed by my government to request that you confirm whether there is such a repatriation plan. And declare that if such a plan is in progress, our government is prepared to receive these repatriated persons either directly or through the Japanese Red Cross. As stated in my previous letter (August 29, 1955), I would like to add that the Japanese government has a strong interest in the repatriation of Japanese nationals and hopes to expedite this matter through direct contact between us. Therefore, I sincerely hope that you can reply to this letter and the previous letter with the shortest possible delay. With highest regards.
			Sincerely,
			Japanese Consul General Tadatsuke Kageichi
			October 20, 1955
				
	(5) November 4, 1955, Shen Ping, Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Geneva, to Tadatsuke Kageichi, Japanese Consul General in Geneva:
	
	Mr. Tadatsuke Kageichi:
	
	I have forwarded your letters of August 29 and October 20 to my government. I am now instructed by my government to reply to the two letters as follows, please forward them to the Japanese government.
		One, the normalization of relations between China and Japan is the common aspiration of the people of both countries, and therefore it is also the primary issue that needs to be resolved by the governments of both countries. I informed you in my letter of August 17 that the Chinese government suggested that the Chinese and Japanese governments hold discussions on various related major issues in order to promote the normalization of relations between the two countries. It is regrettable that your letters of August 29 and October 20 did not respond to this.
		Two, as pointed out in the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on August 16, the issue of Japanese nationals who wish to return to their country returning to Japan has been resolved through the joint efforts of the Chinese Red Cross, the Japanese Red Cross, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee. If any of the Japanese nationals still residing in China apply to return to their country, the Chinese Red Cross and the three Japanese organizations will continue to make appropriate arrangements in accordance with the agreement. Moreover, as far as we know, the Chinese Red Cross is preparing to assist Japanese nationals who have recently applied to return to their country to return home.
		The Chinese government notes the Japanese government's statement that Chinese nationals in Japan have not suffered discrimination and enjoy full freedom to return to their country, but it cannot but point out that this statement does not conform to the actual situation. The statement issued by the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association on September 1 uses concrete facts to illustrate that the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals in Japan have not been properly taken care of, their connection with their motherland and families is still being obstructed, and they do not have the convenience of returning to their country. Recently, the Fifth Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association further revealed the facts that the Hamamatsu Detention Center of the Immigration Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Justice subjected detained Chinese people to inhumane treatment. This cannot but arouse the concern and indignation of the Chinese people. The Chinese government hopes that this situation of Chinese nationals in Japan can be changed, their legitimate rights and interests can be protected, and their freedom to return to their country can not be obstructed or deprived.
		The Chinese government believes that before diplomatic relations between China and Japan are restored, the issue of nationals of both countries returning to or visiting their respective countries can only be temporarily entrusted to people's organizations of the two countries to arrange. This is certainly very inconvenient. Therefore, this issue alone is enough to illustrate the urgency of promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan.
		Three, regarding how the Chinese government will handle Japanese war criminals in China, the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on August 16 has fully explained the Chinese government's position. Handling Japanese war criminals in China is a matter of Chinese sovereignty, and the Chinese government will announce the results of handling war criminals in the near future.
		Four, as pointed out in the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on August 16, the issue of Japanese people who were driven to participate in the war of aggression against China and whose whereabouts are unknown is an issue that should be explained by the Japanese government to the Japanese people. In addition to the approximately 29,000 Japanese nationals who have already returned to their country and the 417 former Japanese soldiers who have committed minor crimes and have been exempted from punishment and sent back to Japan, there are now only more than 6,000 Japanese nationals and more than 1,000 Japanese war criminals in China. There are simply no Japanese people whose situations are unknown. However, based on humanitarian principles, the Chinese Red Cross is still willing to investigate the whereabouts of individual Japanese people as much as possible, as long as the three Japanese organizations, including the Japanese Red Cross, can provide specific materials. This friendly manifestation of the Chinese people towards the Japanese people cannot provide any basis for the Japanese government to raise the issue of the so-called 40,000 Japanese people whose situations are unknown to pester the Chinese government. On the contrary, the issue repeatedly raised by the Japanese government is unfounded and fundamentally untenable. On the other hand, the Chinese people and the Chinese government have not forgotten that the Japanese government has not yet provided an explanation for the issue of tens of thousands of Chinese people who were abducted to Japan to be enslaved and killed.
		Five, there are many major issues related to the interests of the people of both countries between China and Japan that need to be resolved, such as the issue of developing normal trade between China and Japan, the issue of promoting mutual visits between the people of China and Japan, and the issue of properly handling the legitimate rights and interests of nationals of both China and Japan, etc. However, it is obvious that the normalization of relations between China and Japan is the most urgent issue that needs to be resolved. Because, if the state of war between China and Japan is not lifted, and if diplomatic relations between China and Japan are not restored, the resolution of the above-mentioned issues will inevitably be hindered. The Chinese government believes that the time is ripe for the Chinese and Japanese governments to hold discussions on the issue of promoting the normalization of relations between the two countries, and believes that if the Japanese government also has the same desire, a path to the realization of the normalization of relations between the two countries can be found. To this end, the Chinese government is willing to further propose a suggestion, welcoming a delegation dispatched by the Japanese government to hold discussions in Beijing on the issue of promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan. The Chinese government awaits the response of the Japanese government.

    中华人民共和国外交部
    关于中国政府建议中日两国政府就促进中日关系正常化问题进行谈判的公报
    新华社11日讯　中华人民共和国外交部在1956年2月11日发表了关于中国政府建议中日两国政府就促进中日关系正常化问题进行谈判的公报。全文如下：
    1956年1月30日周恩来总理在向中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议所作的政治报告中再次建议，中日两国政府就促进中日关系正常化的问题进行商谈。报告中还提到，中国政府曾经在1955年8月17日和11月4日两次向日本政府建议由两国政府对这个问题进行商谈，而没有得到日本政府的答复。但是，根据日本共同社东京2月3日电，日本外务相重光竟然否认日本政府曾经接到中国政府的任何这样的建议，这是令人不能理解的。为了说明事实真相，中华人民共和国外交部特公布自1955年7月15日以来中日两国政府关于这个问题的全部来往文件如下：
          （一）1955年7月15日日本驻
    日内瓦总领事田付景一致中华人
    民共和国驻日内瓦总领事沈平函先生：
    依照我的政府的指示我荣幸地请求你将我的政府对下述遣返日本国民的要求转达你的政府：
      （1）由于中国红十字会的帮助，日本国民从中国大陆的遣返曾进行到很可观的程度，然而自从今年3月以来这种遣返工作被中止了。
      （2）根据1954年11月访问日本的以李德全夫人为首的一组中国红十字会官员所给的消息，有1，069名日本人被中华人民共和国政府作为战犯拘留着及约有8，000名日本人仍留在中国大陆，此后有2，297人分为3批遣返，因此，目前应约有6，000人仍在中国大陆，这个数字是吻合于日本政府所做的调查结果的，然而仍有其他4万人很显然地曾在中国大陆，但是他们的下落或死亡从未得到证实。
    （3）现在战争结束已有10年了，被拘留的人很自然地强烈要求回家，同时从那些未被拘留者的来信看，他们中很多人也希望回去。另外，这些生死下落不明人的家属也极其希望得知有关他们命运的任何消息。
      （4）日本政府最迫切的希望中华人民共和国政府把这种情况作为人道上的事来考虑，并采取措施释放及遣返被拘留者，告诉日本政府有关未被遣返者的姓名及最后情况，帮助那些要想回来的人回来，尽力查明那些下落不明人的情况，即使他们之中有些已经死了的话，将其遗体送回，俾便其家属能得到及时的通知。日本政府准备同中华人民共和国政府合作，提供可以采用的材料或任何可能的方法，借以促进各个困难的解决。
      （5）日本政府和中华人民共和国政府之间没有外交关系存在，然而不管有无外交关系，日本政府希望中华人民共和国政府在这一事情上将尽其所能，因这纯粹是一人道的事情。先生，我很荣幸地做你的忠诚的仆人。
        日本总领馆　田付景一

    人民共和国驻日内瓦总领事  沈平
    复日本驻日内瓦总领事田付景
    一函田付景一先生：
    你在7月15日交来的信件，我已经转达本国政府。
    7月16日日本外务省又发表了一项公报，在这项公报中包括了来信所提的各项问题。
    对于你交来的信件和日本外务省的上述公报，中华人民共和国外交部发言人已于8月16日发表了声明。现将该声明的抄本一份附上，请你转达贵国政府。
    为了促进中日两国关系的正常化，并有助于国际局势的继续和缓，中国政府认为中日两国政府有必要就两国贸易问题、双方侨民问题、两国人民互相来往问题和其他有关两国人民利益的重大问题进行商谈。如果日本政府抱有同样愿望的话，中华人民共和国政府欢迎同日本政府派遣的代表团在北京举行会谈。我请你将我国政府的上述建议转达日本政府。
    中国政府等候着日本政府的答复。
        中华人民共和国
        驻日内瓦总领事　沈平
                    1955年8月17日
        附：中华人民共和国外
    交部发言人声明
    1955年7月15日日本驻日内瓦总领事代表日本政府就所谓“遣返日本国民的要求”，交给中华人民共和国驻日内瓦总领事照会一件。7月16日日本外务省又就所谓“撤退留在中国大陆的日本人问题”发表了一项公报。在照会和公报中，日本政府提出了毫无根据的指责和片面的无理的要求。对此，外交部发言人发表声明如下：
    首先说到侨民问题。中华人民共和国政府对愿意回国的在华日本侨民一向是给予各种便利的。到1955年3月底为止，经过中国红十字会同日本红十字会、日本中国友好协会、日本和平联络会的共同努力，在原有总数约35，000名日侨中，已有约29，000名愿意回国的日侨返回日本。现在仍然居留中国的有6，000多名日侨，他们表示愿意长期或暂时侨居中国。如果他们中间有人改变意图，申请回国，中国政府仍将给予各种便利，中国红十字会亦将尽力协助。这一点当中国红十字会代表团访问日本时，曾经同日本红十字会等团体达成协议。现在日本政府竟提出所谓“撤侨问题再没有进展”的指责，这是毫无根据的。相反的，中国在日本有数万侨民，他们的正当权益并未得到应有的照顾。他们同祖国和家庭的联系还受着阻挠，他们更没有回国的便利。可见在中日两国侨民问题上，应该谈判解决的并不是日本侨民问题，倒是中国侨民问题。
    关于日本战犯问题。我们早已说过准备按照宽大政策进行处理。在1954年8月，我们已经将417名在日本侵华战争中和在中国人民解放战争中犯有各种罪行的前日本军人免予惩处，送回日本。以后，中国红十字会又将1，069人的战犯名单和情况通知了日本红十字会。对于这些战犯，中华人民共和国政府将按照中国的法律程序进行处理，这是属于中国主权的事情，日本政府无权过问。
    除了上述的日本侨民和日本战犯外，我们这里并没有什么情况不明的日本人。但是，日本政府竟然提出所谓情况不明的4万人问题，这是不能不令人诧异的。日本军国主义者曾经驱使大批日本人参加侵略中国的战争，在这个战争中死亡在中国的日本人很多，其中有些人的死亡确息或者日本政府至今尚未通知其亲属。他们的亲属关怀他们的下落是很自然的，值得同情。中国红十字会根据人道原则，曾经就调查个别日本人的下落问题同日本红十字会等团体达成一项协议，即如果日本红十字会能提出具体材料，中国红十字会愿意尽可能地予以调查。但应指出，这是中国人民对日本人民友好的表现，同日本政府硬说在中国大陆上还有所谓情况不明的4万人的问题毫无关系。更重要的是日本军国主义者在侵略中国的战争期间，曾经使千万以上的中国人民遭受屠杀，数百万万美元的中国公私财产遭受损失，并曾经将成千成万的中国人掳到日本去，加以奴役和杀害。日本政府应该了解，中国人民对于他们遭受的巨大损失，有权要求赔偿。现在日本政府不仅对于这些情况没有做过任何交代，而且无中生有地要求中国交代所谓4万人的问题，这不能不令人怀疑日本政府提出这个问题的动机。
    在平等互利、互相尊重独立和主权的基础上，促进中日两国关系的正常化，以实现中日两国的和平友好，是中日两国人民的共同愿望。两年多以来，中国政府已经一再采取了促进中日关系正常化的步骤，日本政府至今不但没有作出相应的努力，反而想利用日本侨民回国的问题，转移舆论的注意，以掩盖它对促进中日两国关系正常化的消极。其实，日本侨民回国问题早已经由中日两国人民团体妥善地解决了。在这个问题上，即使还有需要继续处理的事项，那也只能是事务性的问题。而今天在中日两国之间倒确实存在着许多有关两国人民利益的重大问题。例如，发展中日两国的正常贸易，促进中日两国人民的互相往来，妥善处理中日两国侨民的正当权益，这些都是需要中日两国政府来解决的问题。如果日本政府真正具有诚意来寻求中日两国关系正常化的途径，就应该从这些问题着手。中国政府是准备就这些问题同日本政府进行谈判的。
                    1955年8月16日
          （三）1955年8月29日日本驻
      日内瓦总领事田付景一致中华人
    民共和国驻日内瓦总领事沈平函亲爱的总领事先生：
    我愿通知你，你于1955年8月17日交给我的信已照转我国政府，我现奉我国政府之命，请惠予转达贵政府如下：
    一、日本政府直接请求中华人民共和国政府予以合作，以解决在战争结束十年后，仍有人不能回家的情况。如前所述，日本政府认为这纯是一个人道问题。
    二、关于中华人民共和国外交部发言人8月16日声明中的某几点，日本政府的立场如下：
      （1）日本政府对于声明中所说仍在大陆上的6，000名左右日侨中，如有申请回日本者，中华人民共和国政府将予以便利，中国红十字会亦将尽力予以协助一事表示感谢。它希望这个声明将能实现，因为其中已有人要求回国。其中某些人的名单一份已由日本红十字会转交中国红十字会，并已交给中华人民共和国驻日内瓦总领事。兹请中华人民共和国政府对他们以及今后日本政府可能通知中华人民共和国政府的其他人给予便利。
      （2）关于情况不明的约4万名日侨。根据日本政府进行的调查，这些人的记载表明，他们或于战争结束之际或于1949年中曾在中国大陆，其后日本政府就不明其下落。已返国者，已被送去苏联者，以及已知悉死亡者，都不包括在内，其中有些人也许已死亡，有些人也许在边远交通不便的地方，无论如何既然他们的家属等待着关于他们的情况的任何消息，故日本政府亟欲得到关于他们的消息，如果中华人民共和国政府有任何消息的话。日本政府并亟愿中国政府调查他们的情况。如前所述，日本政府准备提供它所保有的任何材料，并对此种调查予以合作。
      （3）关于战犯问题，日本政府亦望知道他们是以什么罪名被拘留的。然而日本政府希望中华人民共和国政府能以人道主义的精神来考虑这件事情，尽快将他们释放，并送回。关于这一方面可提及有些国家已经释放了第二次世界大战中的所有战犯；有些国家则把他们交回在他们的本国服刑。
      （4）中华人民共和国外交部发言人的声明也提到侨居日本的中国平民问题，可指出，在日本中国侨民和其他任何外侨一样，没有遭到歧视，他们并享有回国的充分自由，如果他们愿意回国的话。我们的遣送船只曾运送中国侨民回国，这是不需要说的。
    三、日本政府认为日本政府及中华人民共和国政府之间应首先解决日侨包括战犯在内的回国问题。由于这个问题纯粹是一个人道问题，两国政府间之缺乏外交关系不应在共同从事解决此问题中造成困难。兹诚恳地请求中华人民共和国政府能对日本政府关于此问题的立场予以有利的反应。谢谢你的转达。

    日内瓦总领事田付景一致中华人
    民共和国驻日内瓦总领事沈平函亲爱的总领事先生：
    我得悉1955年9月28日在日内瓦举行之红十字会协会执行委员会的会议上，中华人民共和国红十字会代表宣布约200名日本侨民之遣返工作在准备之中。并据悉，中华人民共和国中央委员会主席毛泽东先生关于“战犯”的遣返问题，最近向访问中华人民共和国之一些日本国会议员宣称所有患病者、年老者或判处轻刑者将于本年底被送回国。于此，我现奉我国政府之命，请求你证实是否有此种遣返计划。并声明，如此种计划在进行中，则我国政府准备亲自或委托日本红十字会接收这些被遣返者，如我前信（1955年8月29日）所述，我要补充说，日本政府对遣返日侨事有强烈的兴趣，并希望通过我们之间的直接接触，以加速此事。因此诚恳地希望你能以最短的延搁答复此信与前信。此致最崇高敬意。          日本总领事田付景一谨上
                      1955年10月20日
      （五）1955年11月4日中华人民共和国驻日内瓦总领事沈平复日本驻日内瓦总领事田付景一函田付景一先生：
    你8月29日和10月20日的来信，我已经转达我国政府。现奉我国政府之命对两次来信答复如下，请你转达日本政府。
    一、中日两国关系正常化是两国人民的共同愿望，因此也是两国政府需要解决的首要问题。我曾经在8月17日的信中通知你，中国政府建议，由中日两国政府为了促进两国关系正常化而就各项有关的重大问题进行商谈。你8月29日和10月20日的来信对此未作答复，不能不令人感到遗憾。
    二、正如8月16日中华人民共和国外交部发言人的声明所指出的，由于中国红十字会同日本红十字会、日本中国友好协会、日本和平联络会的共同努力，愿意回国的日侨返回日本的问题已经解决。现在仍然居留在中国的日侨中如果有人申请回国，中国红十字会同日本红十字会等3团体将会按照协议继续作出妥善的安排；而且据我们所知，对于最近提出申请回国的日侨，中国红十字会正在进行协助他们回国的准备工作。
    中国政府注意到日本政府所作的关于在日本的中国侨民没有遭到歧视并且享有回国的充分自由的声明，但是不能不指出，这个声明同实际情况并不相符。东京华侨总会9月1日的声明书用具体的事实说明了，在日华侨的正当权益没有得到应有的照顾，他们同祖国和家庭的联系还受着阻挠，他们更没有回国的便利。最近在日本中国友好协会的第五次大会上，更揭露了日本法务省入国管理局滨松收容所对被收容的中国人施行非人道待遇的事实。这不能不引起中国人民的关怀和愤慨。中国政府希望，在日华侨的这种处境能够得到改变，他们的正当权益能够得到保护，他们回国的自由能够不受到阻挠和剥夺。
      中国政府认为，在中日两国邦交没有恢复以前，两国侨民回国或者来往本国的问题，只能暂时委托两国的人民团体进行安排。这当然是很不便当的。所以，单是这个问题就足以说明促进中日两国关系正常化的迫切性。
    三、关于中国政府如何处理在中国的日本战犯的问题，8月16日中华人民共和国外交部发言人的声明已经充分说明了中国政府的立场。处理在中国的日本战犯是属于中国主权的事，中国政府将在最近期间把处理战犯的结果公布。
    四、正如8月16日中华人民共和国外交部发言人的声明所指出的，被驱使参加侵略中国的战争而下落不明的日本人的问题，是应该由日本政府向日本人民交代的问题。除了已经回国的约29，000名日侨和已经免予惩处、送回日本的417名犯有轻微罪行的前日本军人以外，现在在中国的只有6，000多名日侨和1，000多名日本战犯，根本没有什么情况不明的日本人。但是，根据人道的原则，中国红十字会仍然愿意对个别日本人的下落问题尽可能地予以调查，只要日本红十字会等三团体能提出具体的材料。中国人民对日本人民的这种友好表现，丝毫不能使日本政府有任何根据提出所谓情况不明的4万名日本人问题来同中国政府纠缠。相反的，日本政府一再提出的这个问题是无中生有的，是根本不能成立的。另一方面，中国人民和中国政府却没有忘记，对于成千成万的中国人被掳到日本去被奴役和杀害的问题，日本政府至今还没有作出交代。
    五、中日两国之间有许多有关两国人民利益的重大问题需要解决，例如发展中日两国正常贸易问题、促进中日两国人民的互相来往问题和妥善处理中日两国侨民的正当权益问题等等。但是，很显然，中日两国关系正常化是最迫切需要解决的问题。因为，如果不解除中日两国之间的战争状态，如果不恢复中日两国的邦交，上述各项问题的解决必然会受到阻碍。中国政府认为，中日两国政府就促进两国关系正常化的问题进行商谈的时机已经成熟，并且相信，如果日本政府也具有同样的愿望，实现两国关系正常化的途径是可以找到的。为此，中国政府愿意进一步提出建议，欢迎同日本政府派遣的代表团在北京就促进中日两国关系正常化的问题进行商谈。中国政府等待着日本政府的答复。
