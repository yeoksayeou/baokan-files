Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd. This agency's special correspondent reports: Liu Yongming, a Chinese student who studied in the United States and was just released after being confined in a mental hospital for six years, is again under strong pressure from American spies, who are trying to induce him not to return to China, not to return to his wife and daughter.

The facts that have now come to light reveal the truth. It is said that when Liu Yongming arrived in Hong Kong on Tuesday with other Chinese students returning from the United States, he said he wanted to stay in Hong Kong.

But Zhang Manli, a 55-year-old returned overseas Chinese, told reporters today: "On the way from San Francisco on the 'President Wilson', I shared a cabin with Liu Yongming. He was often tormented by some Americans on the ship, who came to see him specifically. They took every opportunity to talk to him when I couldn't hear."

"When the ship docked at Honolulu, Manila, and Yokohama, American spies boarded the ship to visit Liu Yongming."

"As the voyage progressed, Liu Yongming became more and more nervous, and he avoided me and other returning compatriots."

On Tuesday morning, when the "President Wilson" arrived in Hong Kong, Liu Yongming answered the roll call around 7 am. Shortly after this, a waiter called him aside to give him a telegram. After that, other returning compatriots never saw him again.

An hour after other Chinese students who studied in the United States disembarked and went to the mainland, a press conference was held on the "President Wilson." This was arranged by Jay Ler Murray, an official from the Hong Kong government information office, before the ship arrived in Hong Kong.

At the press conference, Liu Yongming was very pale, with disheveled hair, wearing a woolen sweater, and his coat was hanging on his arm. He answered questions vaguely and incoherently.

At one point, he said he was not Chinese, but a Mexican born in Turkey. At another time, he said he was Japanese. It is said that when an American reporter asked him why he wanted to stay in Hong Kong, he replied: "Because your country has a dispute with my country."

Another American reporter, in order to trick him into slandering his motherland, asked him if he thought there was no freedom in China. This reporter knew that he had been in an American mental hospital for six years.

McCreton, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong Immigration Bureau, attended the press conference. Liu Yongming said many incoherent things at the meeting, but McCreton only seized on the point that he wanted to stay in Hong Kong. After the press conference, he made it clear that he had no idea that Liu Yongming wanted to stay in Hong Kong before.

McCreton explained that Liu Yongming did not have a passport, only a British transit permit issued in New York.

Liu Yongming was sent to the State Mental Hospital in Farmington, Missouri, in 1949. The president of the hospital wrote a letter to Liu Yongming's wife in December 1950, announcing that Liu Yongming was fit to return home and that arrangements were being made for Liu Yongming's return.

A few months later, Liu Yongming himself said in a letter to his family that he hoped to "get rid of this painful place" and return to China.

No letters have been received from Liu Yongming or the hospital since June 1951.

After Liu Yongming's wife asked the Chinese authorities to raise his case based on the Sino-US agreement on the repatriation of civilians, he was finally released a few weeks ago and allowed to leave the United States.

The Associated Press said that when Liu Yongming boarded the "President Wilson" in San Francisco on January 9, he said he intended to participate in China's construction industry as a civil engineer.

Other students returning home on the same ship said that on Monday, the day before they landed, the ship received a telegram from Hong Kong saying that Liu Yongming's luggage should be separated from their luggage. They said the news was revealed by a waiter.

On Tuesday morning, before the roll call, Liu Yongming was called away by an American while he was busy packing his luggage.

On the same morning, Liu Yongming's wife, Gui Qionghua, and his 8-year-old daughter, Liu Meimei, waited at the Shenzhen fence for several hours. They were very disappointed when they did not see Liu Yongming appear with the other 50 returning Chinese.

Liu Meimei was unwilling to leave the fence, just kept saying: "I want my daddy, my daddy said he would come back."

Liu Yongming is now housed in a refugee camp under the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Social Bureau.

A reporter from "Ta Kung Pao" visited him in the refugee camp. Judging from Liu Yongming's answers during this visit, it is obvious that someone has instilled all sorts of lies into him and told him that his wife is no longer in China.

This is a shocking example of American ruthlessness - subjecting a person who has just come out of the hospital to such mental pressure, and trying to prevent him from returning to his motherland and family.

### 在美国特务的压力和诱使下  刘永铭到香港后还没有回到祖国大陆的真相

    在美国特务的压力和诱使下
    刘永铭到香港后还没有回到祖国大陆的真相
    新华社广州3日电　本社特派记者报道：在一个神经病院中被禁闭了6年以后刚刚获得释放的中国留美学生刘永铭，又受到美国特务对他的强大压力，他们企图诱使他不要回到中国，不回到他的妻子和女儿那里去。
    现在透露出来的事实使真相大白。据说，当刘永铭在星期二同其他归国的中国留美学生到达香港的时候，他说他愿意留在香港。
    但是张满理、一个55岁的回国侨胞今天对记者说：“在乘‘威尔逊总统号’从旧金山来的一路上，我同刘永铭住在一个船舱内。他经常受到在船上的某些美国人的折磨，这些人是特地来看他的。他们利用各种机会在我听不到的时候同他讲话。”
    “在这艘船停靠檀香山、马尼拉和横滨的时候，美国特务都上船来访问刘永铭。”
    “随着航行的前进，刘永铭变得越来越神经质了，他躲避我和其他回国的同胞。”
    星期二早上，当“威尔逊总统号”到达香港的时候，刘永铭在清晨7时左右的点名中应了名。在这以后不久，一个侍者把他叫到一边给他一封电报。以后，其他回国同胞就都没有再见到他。
    在其他中国留美学生离船赴大陆以后一小时，在“威尔逊总统号”上举行了一个记者招待会。这是香港政府新闻处官员杰·勒·穆利在这个邮船到达香港以前就安排好的。
    在记者招待会上，刘永铭脸色非常苍白，头发蓬松，身穿绒线衣，上衣挂在手臂上，答复问题时含糊不清，语无伦次。
    有一个时候他说，他不是中国人，而是生在土耳其的墨西哥人。在另一个时候他说，他是一个日本人。据说，当一个美国记者问他为什么希望留在香港的时候，他回答说：“因为你的国家同我的国家发生了纠纷。”
    另一个美国记者为了骗使他污蔑他的祖国，问他是否认为在中国没有自由，这个记者是知道他是在一个美国神经病院住了6年的。
    香港移民局副局长麦克雷顿出席了记者招待会。刘永铭在会上说了许多没有条理的话，但是麦克雷顿只抓住了他说他希望留在香港这一点。他在记者招待会结束后明白表示，在这以前他根本不知道刘永铭希望留在香港。
    麦克雷顿解释说，刘永铭没有护照，只有在纽约发的一张英国过境许可证。
    刘永铭是在1949年被送进密苏里州法明敦的州立神经病院的。这个病院的院长在1950年12月写给刘永铭的妻子一封信中，宣布刘永铭适宜回国，并且说正在安排刘永铭的回国事宜。
    几个月后，刘永铭自己在写给他的家中的一封信中说，他希望“摆脱这个令人痛苦的地方”而回到中国。
    从1951年6月以后就没有再接到刘永铭或这个病院的信了。
    在刘永铭的妻子要求中国当局根据关于遣返两国平民的中美协定提出他的问题以后，他终于在几星期以前获释并且被允许离开美国。
    美联社说，刘永铭于1月9日在旧金山搭乘了“威尔逊总统号”的时候说，他打算作为一个土木工程师参加中国的建筑工业。
    同船回国的其他留学生说，在他们登陆的前一天，即星期一，船上接到一封从香港拍来的电报，这封电报说，应该把刘永铭的行李和他们的行李分开。他们说，这个消息是侍者透露的。
    在星期二早晨，在点名之前，刘永铭在忙着整理行李的时候被一个美国人叫走了。
    同日早晨，刘永铭的妻子桂琼华和他的8岁的女儿刘美美在深圳栅栏等了好几个小时。当她们没有看到刘永铭和其他50个回国的中国人一块出现的时候感到非常失望。
    刘美美不愿离开这个栅门，只是不停地说：“我要我的爹爹，我爸爸说过他要回来的。”
    刘永铭现在被安置在归香港社会局管辖的一个难民营里。
    “大公报”的一个记者到难民营里访问了他。从刘永铭在这次访问中的回答看来，显然是有人向他灌输了各式各样的谎话，并且对他说，他的妻子已经不在中国。
    这是美国的令人震惊的冷酷无情的一个例子——使一个刚从医院里出来的人受到这种精神压力，并且设法不让他回到他的祖国和家庭。
