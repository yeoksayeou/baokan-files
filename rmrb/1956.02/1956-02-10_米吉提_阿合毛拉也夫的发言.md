    Migiti Ahemulaev's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I completely agree with and support the reports of Premier Zhou and other leaders.
    I am a small water conservancy technician from the remote border region of the motherland. I feel honored to be able to attend the CPPCC meeting and see our beloved Chairman Mao. Our beloved motherland is now in the midst of a great upsurge of socialist construction and socialist transformation. In such a great era, every patriotic Chinese citizen will spare no effort to contribute all their energy to this great and solemn cause.
    The "National Agricultural Development Program" recently proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is very inspiring. There is no doubt that the formulation and implementation of this program will enable our country's 500 million agricultural population to transition to a happy and prosperous socialist society as soon as possible. Therefore, I believe that the timely introduction of this draft program is in line with the current situation of the upsurge in agricultural cooperation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, like the people of the Han ethnic group in the interior, are also looking forward to the early realization of a socialist society day and night. According to the requirements of the rapid development of national construction, this region must also take faster steps to catch up with the development of the new situation. Xinjiang is a vast region with abundant resources, a relatively small population, and great development prospects. Especially in agriculture, since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and with the strong support of the heroic People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, many reservoirs and rivers have been built, and many wasteland has been reclaimed in southern and northern Xinjiang. However, these measures are still far from meeting the requirements of the comprehensive agricultural cooperation plan in this region. According to national requirements, the sown area in this region will reach approximately 110 million mu from 1956 to 1967. To reach and exceed this target, the first problem facing us is water conservancy. Our country requires a large amount of wasteland to be reclaimed throughout the country, and Xinjiang is actually one of the main wasteland-owning regions in the country. The soil is also suitable for planting cash crops such as cotton, and the alpine snow water source is quite abundant, but it has not been fully utilized. In accordance with the national requirements for immigrant reclamation and the large-scale expansion of arable land after the basic agricultural cooperation in this region, Xinjiang must accelerate the large-scale reclamation of wasteland to serve the country's socialist construction and socialist cause. At the same time, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is about to be completed. In order to prepare conditions for the large-scale economic construction of this region in the future, we must vigorously develop agriculture and animal husbandry. Xinjiang has a dry climate, and agricultural production relies almost entirely on irrigation. Therefore, to develop agriculture and animal husbandry on a large scale, we must first start by solving the water conservancy problem. The key issue in a series of problems in the development of water conservancy construction is the allocation of technical personnel. Some comrades have mentioned this issue in their speeches at the conference, and I think it is also necessary to put this issue in an important position. Xinjiang is a minority nationality area, and in the past, there were no universities or specialized schools, so the source of technical cadres was very difficult. In addition, due to language and writing barriers, technical cadres were not well trained in the past. The number of existing technical cadres is very small. After liberation, thanks to the strong support of the Party and the People's Government, some have been trained locally. Although the technical force has greatly increased compared with the past, it is far behind the actual needs according to the development of the current situation and the future tasks of water conservancy work. Xinjiang's future irrigated area will be larger than other provinces, but the technical force is very weak. In this region, in addition to the existing 20 million mu of cultivated land, it is estimated that the irrigated area will be expanded by about 90 million mu at the lowest. Therefore, if we do not take active action, seize the time to grasp all important preparatory work, it will inevitably affect the rapid development of agriculture, animal husbandry and other production and construction undertakings in the future. This is a problem that deserves to be raised and deserves special attention. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, in addition to closely relying on the people of all ethnic groups in this region to do their best to overcome difficulties and tap their potential, we intend to ask the central government to continue to dispatch water conservancy technical cadres from various provinces in the interior to Xinjiang to participate in construction work in the future. Second, we intend to ask the central government to continue to train more local ethnic water conservancy cadres for this region, and to send experienced water conservancy technical experts to the border areas to inspect and guide water conservancy construction work from time to time. Third, send ethnic students and cadres to study in the Soviet Union for further study under possible conditions. Fourth, in the case of "supply exceeding demand" for scientific books on water conservancy translated into Uyghur, the central government is required to provide more relevant reference books and materials published by the Soviet Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and other republics with similar Uyghur language and writing, in order to comprehensively study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

    米吉提·阿合毛拉也夫的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意并拥护周总理及各位首长的报告。
    我是祖国遥远边疆的一个小小的水利技术工作人员，此次能列席政协会议并看到了亲爱的毛主席，毕生将会感到荣幸。我们可爱的祖国现在正处在伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的高潮之中，在这样一个伟大的时代中，每一个有动于中的中国公民是会毫不吝惜将自己全部精力贡献给伟大而庄严的事业的。
    最近中共中央提出的“全国农业发展纲要”，是很令人振奋的。毫无疑问，这个纲要的制定与实施将会使我国5亿多农业人口及早过渡到美满、幸福的社会主义社会的。所以我认为这个纲要草案的及时提出，是符合于当前农业合作化高潮形势发展情况的。新疆维吾尔自治区的各族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，与内地汉族老大哥人民一样，也是日日夜夜地盼望着早日实现社会主义社会的。本区根据国家建设事业迅速发展的要求，也必须采取较快的速度赶上新形势的发展。新疆是一个地大、物博、人口较为稀少而很有发展前途的一个地区。尤其在农业方面，自解放后在中国共产党的领导和驻新疆英勇的人民解放军的大力支持下，在南、北疆兴建了许多水库、河道，开垦了许多荒地。但这些措施，距本区农业合作化全面规划的要求还相差很远。根据国家要求，1956年至1967年本区播种面积将要达到11，000万亩左右的指标。要达到和超过这个指标，首先摆在我们面前的问题就是水利问题。我们国家要求在全国范围内大量开垦荒地，而新疆实为全国主要荒地拥有地区之一，土壤也适宜于种植棉花等经济作物，高山雪水水源相当丰富，但还没有得到充分地利用。依照国家移民垦荒以及本地区农业基本合作化以后大量扩增耕地的要求，新疆必须加紧大规模开垦荒地，为国家的社会主义建设和社会主义事业服务。同时兰新铁路即将修通，为了给本区今后大规模经济建设准备条件，必须大力发展农牧业。新疆气候干燥，农业生产几乎全部依靠灌溉。所以要大规模发展农牧业，首先必须着手解决水利问题。而发展水利建设中的一系列问题中的关键问题，就是技术力量的配备问题。关于这个问题，有些同志们在大会发言中已提到了，我认为这个问题亦有必要放在重要的位置上。新疆是个少数民族地区，过去没有大学、专科学校，故技术干部的来源就很困难。加以语言、文字隔膜，过去也未很好培养技术干部，现在原有的一些技术干部为数很少，解放后由于党和人民政府的大力支援，本地陆续也培养了一些。技术力量虽较以前是有了很大的增加，但根据目前形势的发展和今后水利工作任务来看，则远远落后于现实的需求。新疆今后灌溉面积要比其他各省大，而技术力量则很薄弱。本区在灌溉方面除现有耕地两千万亩外，以最低估计约再扩大灌溉面积9，000万亩左右。因而若不积极地行动起来，争取时间抓紧一切重要的准备工作，必将影响今后农牧业及其他生产建设事业的迅速发展。这是值得提出和值得特别重视的一个问题。因之，在党的领导下，我们除紧密地依靠本区各族人民共同尽最大努力克服困难、发挥潜力外，拟请中央在今后由内地各省继续调派水利技术干部赴新疆参加建设工作。第二，拟请中央继续多为本区培养本地民族水利干部，并请时常派有经验的水利技术专家赴边疆巡回视察并指导水利建设工作。第三，在可能的条件下派民族学员及干部赴苏联留学，以资深造。第四，用维吾尔文字所翻译的水利等科学书籍目前在“供不应求”的情况下，要求中央多供给与维吾尔族语言、文字相近似的苏联乌兹别克斯坦、吉尔吉斯斯坦、哈萨克斯坦等共和国出版的有关参考书籍和材料，以便全面学习苏联先进经验。
