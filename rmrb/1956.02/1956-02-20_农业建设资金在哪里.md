    Where Does Agricultural Construction Funding Come From?
    After formulating a comprehensive agricultural production plan, Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, began to carry out basic construction such as farmland water conservancy. Where did the construction funds come from? The most important source was the masses. Party and government leading organs called on the masses to "save all unnecessary expenses, utilize everything that can be utilized, and invest in agricultural construction." The broad masses took action under the slogan of "turning dead treasures into living treasures." The women of the Beiti Village Agricultural Cooperative contributed silver utensils worth more than 600 yuan to the cooperative as an investment; they wanted to buy a diesel engine and name it "Women's Engine." To build water conservancy projects, a large number of bricks were needed. Many farmers contributed their temporarily unused old bricks as investments. Farmers throughout the county contributed more than 2.6 million old bricks, with a total investment value of nearly 196,000 yuan.
    In order to continuously and rapidly increase agricultural production, a large amount of capital is needed; if we rely solely on state loans, many things that could have been done earlier will be delayed, which is not good for the country or the masses. As long as we do a good job in ideological education and correctly stipulate the methods for using members' investments (such as stipulating reasonable repayment periods and interest rates), we will certainly be able to turn the large amount of "dead treasures" in the hands of the masses into "living treasures."

    农业建设资金在哪里
    山西省解虞县制定了农业生产全面规划以后，就着手进行农田水利等基本建设。建设资金从哪里来呢？最主要的是从群众中来。党政领导机关号召群众“节约一切不必要的开支，利用一切能利用的东西，投资进行农业建设”。广大群众在“死宝变活宝”的口号下行动起来了。北梯村农业社的妇女，拿出了价值600多元的银器向社里投资；她们要买一部柴油机，命名为“妇女号”。兴修水利需要大量的砖，许多农民把暂时不用的旧砖都拿来作为投资，全县农民共拿出了旧砖260多万块，投资总值将近196，000元。
    为了不断地迅速地提高农业生产，需要大量的资金；如果单纯依靠国家贷款，许多本来可以早办的事情就会拖迟，这对国家对群众都不利。只要做好思想教育工作，正确地规定使用社员投资的办法（如规定合理的还期和利息等），一定能把群众手里的大量“死宝”变成“活宝”。
