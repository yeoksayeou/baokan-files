Xinhua News Agency, 20th—The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation telegraphed the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students on the 20th respectively, to commemorate the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism."

    The telegram from the All-China Youth Federation stated: Last year, the struggle of the youth of colonial and oppressed countries for national independence forcefully struck at the collapsing colonial system. The Asian-African Conference once again demonstrated the firm will of millions of oppressed people and youth to break free from imperialist enslavement. However, the American aggressive bloc is now increasingly intensifying its plunder and suppression of the people of colonial countries. Facts prove that the American aggressive bloc is not only the main pillar of world colonial rule, but also the largest colonialist in the world today. The telegram concluded: Chinese youth deeply sympathize with the plight of colonial youth and fully support their just struggle. We are determined to fight resolutely with the youth of all countries to defend peace and oppose colonialism. We sincerely wish the youth of colonial and oppressed countries greater success in their struggle for freedom and independence.
    The telegram from the All-China Students' Federation stated: Chinese students deeply understand that the colonial system is the root cause of the plight of students in oppressed countries. Now, the struggle of the people of these countries for national independence is impacting the evil colonial system with surging momentum. Their struggle has become an important force in defending peace and opposing war. We firmly believe that the just struggle of the people and students of these countries will surely achieve victory. Chinese students deeply care about the lives and struggles of students in all oppressed countries. We sincerely wish them greater success in their struggle to defend peace, fight for national independence, and oppose aggression.

    纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”
    我国青联和学联电世界青联和国际学联
    新华社20日讯　中华全国民主青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会20日分别打电报给世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会，纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”。
    中华全国民主青年联合会的电报中说：去年，殖民地被压迫国家人民的青年争取民族独立的斗争有力地打击了正在崩溃中的殖民体系。亚非会议再次显示出千百万被压迫人民和青年要求摆脱帝国主义奴役的坚决意志。但是，美国侵略集团现在还正在日益加紧掠夺和镇压殖民地各国人民，事实证明：美国侵略集团不仅是世界殖民统治的主要支柱，而且它自己就是目前全世界最大的殖民主义者。电报最后说：中国青年深切同情殖民地青年的处境并且全力支持他们的正义斗争。我们决心和各国青年一道，为保卫和平、反对殖民主义而坚决斗争。我们谨祝殖民地被压迫国家青年争取自由和独立的斗争取得更大的成就。
    中华全国学生联合会的电报中说：中国学生深知殖民制度是造成被压迫国家学生痛苦处境的根源。现在这些国家的人民争取民族独立的斗争正以汹涌澎湃的声势冲击着万恶的殖民制度。他们的斗争已成为保卫和平、反对战争的一支重要力量。我们深信，这些国家人民和学生的正义斗争一定能够获得胜利。中国学生深切关心着一切被压迫国家学生的生活和斗争。我们衷心祝他们在保卫和平，争取民族独立，反对侵略的斗争中获得更大的成就。
