A Letter of Criticism's Ordeal

    In July 1955, the People's Daily reader's letters department received a letter from Ren Keqiang, a staff member of the Shenyang Sixth Engineering Team under the Ministry of Railways, exposing the erroneous behavior of the Shenyang Railway Public Security Cadre School in deceiving higher authorities and wasting national construction funds. The letter stated: This school wanted to build a club, but the relevant leading departments of the Ministry of Railways did not approve it. Therefore, they used the pretext of building large classrooms and laundry rooms to fraudulently obtain approval from higher authorities and build a luxurious club. Since this incident involved the relevant leading departments of the Ministry of Railways, and the People's Railway News also received the same letter from Ren Keqiang, we forwarded the letter to the People's Railway News for joint handling.

    In January of this year, this letter returned to the People's Daily reader's letters department, with nearly 20 large and small slips attached, bearing various opinions. However, unfortunately, although this letter traveled through more than a dozen units for half a year, the problem it exposed was not addressed. All of these units felt that they could not handle this error of the Shenyang Railway Public Security Cadre School.

    Is it that this letter did not find the relevant competent authority? No, that is not the case at all. This letter had been to the People's Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways more than once. In principle, this unit has the right and the responsibility to ensure that this issue is addressed. However, after the People's Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways forwarded this letter internally several times and it was returned several times, it transferred the matter to a certain unit of the Ministry of Public Security for handling. The reason given was: the financial work of the Shenyang Railway Public Security Cadre School was transferred to the leadership of a certain unit of the Ministry of Public Security in July 1955 (the school's business work was originally under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Security).

    However, not long after, a certain unit of the Ministry of Public Security returned the letter. Their reason was: the project mentioned in the reader's letter was started in September 1954 when the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Railways was in charge of the school's financial work, and it was basically completed when they took over. Therefore, although the settlement of expenses in the future is related to them, they cannot handle this problem.

    Therefore, this letter was transferred to the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. After a week, the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Railways wrote "Transfer to the People's Letters Office of the People's Supervision Bureau" in large characters on the forwarding slip of the People's Supervision Bureau and returned the letter.

    After another month, the People's Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways returned the letter and all related slips to the People's Railway News. In a letter explaining the handling of this letter to the People's Railway News, they complained: "We have contacted the relevant units many times; however, the relevant units have used 'lack of understanding of the situation' and 'changes in leadership relations' as reasons to shirk responsibility from each other…." The units that adopted the method of shirking responsibility mentioned here, of course, also include the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which was deceived by the Shenyang Railway Public Security Cadre School at the time; but why did the People's Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways feel helpless? Have they forgotten what responsibilities and rights the supervisory authorities have?

    Of course, the Education Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and a certain unit of the Ministry of Public Security should also reconsider whether their reasons for believing that they cannot handle this error of the Shenyang Railway Public Security Cadre School are correct. If their reasons are "correct," then should the following conclusion be drawn: after a change in leadership relations, the shortcomings and errors in past work can no longer be corrected and handled?

    一封批评信的遭遇
    1955年7月，本报读者来信部收到铁道部所属沈阳第六工程队工作人员任克强的一封来信，揭发沈阳铁路公安干部学校欺骗上级机关和浪费国家建设资金的错误行为。来信说：这个学校要修俱乐部，铁道部有关领导部门没有批准，于是，他们就用修建大教室和洗涤室的名义来骗取上级批准，修了一个豪华的俱乐部。由于这个事件牵涉到铁道部有关领导部门，而且人民铁道报也收到了任克强同样的来信，因此我们就把来信转请人民铁道报一并处理。
    今年1月，这封来信回到了本报读者来信部，上面附了批着各种意见的大小签条近20张。但是，很可惜，这封来信虽然在十几个单位里旅行了半年，其中揭发的问题却并没有得到处理。所有这些单位都认为他们不能处理沈阳铁路公安干部学校的这个错误。
    是不是这封来信没有找到有关的主管机关呢？不，完全不是这样。这封来信曾经不止一次地到过铁道部人民监察局。按理说，这个单位是有权利也有责任使这个问题得到处理的。但是铁道部人民监察局把这封来信在铁道部内部几次转出去而又几次被退回来以后，就转请公安部某单位处理这件事情了。理由是：沈阳铁路公安干部学校的财政工作在1955年7月就改由公安部某单位领导了（这个学校的业务工作原来就由公安部领导）。
    但是，不久以后，公安部某单位又把这封来信退回去了。他们的理由是：读者来信里提到的那项工程，是在1954年9月铁道部教育局掌管学校财政工作的时候开工的，到他们接管的时候已经基本结束。因此，尽管今后结算经费开支同他们有关，他们也不能处理这个问题。
    于是，这封来信又被转到了铁道部教育局。经过一个星期，铁道部教育局在人民监察局的转信条上批上“移人民监察局人民来信处”几个大字，又把来信退回去了。
    又经过了一个多月，铁道部人民监察局把来信和有关的签条全部退给了人民铁道报。他们在向人民铁道报说明处理这封来信的经过的函件中诉苦说：“我们多次同有关单位进行了联系；但是有关单位却以
  ‘不了解情况’和‘领导关系已经改变’为理由互相推托……。”这里提到的采取推托办法的单位，当然也包括当时受沈阳铁路公安干部学校欺骗的铁道部教育局在内；但是铁道部人民监察局为什么居然感到束手无策呢？难道他们忘记了监察机关有什么责任和权利了？
    当然，还需要请铁道部教育局和公安部某单位再考虑一下他们认为不能处理沈阳铁路公安干部学校这个错误的理由是否正确。如果他们的理由是“对”的，那末是不是应该得出这样一个结论：一个单位在领导关系改变以后，过去工作中的缺点和错误就无法再进行纠正和处理了？
