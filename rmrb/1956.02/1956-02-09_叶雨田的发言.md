    Ye Yutian's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and agree with Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo's report on "The Mission of Intellectuals in the High Tide of the Socialist Revolution," Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, Vice-Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries, and Committee Member Chen Boda's report.
    I am an industrialist and businessman from Xi'an, and I would like to talk about some situations and opinions regarding the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.
    With the unfolding of the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce has also entered a high tide. Under the specific leadership of the local Party and government and the promotion of employee comrades, private industry and commerce in Xi'an City, starting from December of last year and continuing until January 13th of this year, have all realized joint state-private ownership. This is a part of the great victory of the state's peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
    For more than a month recently, Xi'an City has been immersed in joy, and industrialists and businessmen are cheering for entering the gate of socialism. On January 15th, a celebration meeting of more than 100,000 people was held in the city, and industrialists, businessmen, and employees gathered together in a parade. Many family members of industrialists and businessmen also participated in the parade, and they joyfully performed the yangko dance on the streets and among the crowds, happy that their loved ones had embarked on the bright road. This kind of scene had never occurred in the past.
    In the process of implementing joint state-private ownership across the entire industry, my experience is: First, doing a good job of ideological mobilization is the foundation for doing all work well. According to the spirit of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Executive Committee meeting, we conducted communication and learning within industrial and commercial circles. Because this work was done relatively comprehensively and deeply, industrialists and businessmen had a clear understanding of their future, thereby increasing their enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation. This is specifically manifested in the following three aspects: (1) When the work of implementing joint state-private ownership across the entire industry was launched, it immediately set off a wave of enthusiasm, with widespread applications for joint state-private ownership; (2) In the assessment of assets, generally everyone was able to carry out the work in a spirit of seeking truth from facts, fairness, and reasonableness; (3) In order to express their enthusiasm for accepting transformation, many industrialists and businessmen voluntarily invested off-the-books funds into enterprises. As of mid-January, according to incomplete statistics, there were more than 80,000 yuan. Second, we must value the power of core elements. In the high tide of joint state-private ownership across the entire industry, core elements actively took the lead, worked hard, publicized policies, and set an example, driving the masses forward, thereby enabling many industrialists and businessmen to break through their concerns and actively participate in the socialist transformation movement. Third, we must mobilize social forces from all aspects. Under the mobilization and education of the Communist Youth League and the Democratic Youth Federation, the enthusiasm of many young industrialists and businessmen was extremely high, becoming a new force in the transformation movement of industrial and commercial circles; the Democratic Women's Federation also mobilized the family members of industrialists and businessmen to participate in learning, encouraging them to actively help their loved ones accept transformation, which also played a considerable role. All of this fully proves the correctness of the Party and government's policies and the improvement of the masses' awareness.
    After the implementation of joint state-private ownership across the entire industry, the relations of production of enterprises have been changed, but enterprise transformation is only one aspect of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. More importantly, it is the ideological transformation of industrialists and businessmen. Because our ideological understanding often lags behind the enterprise transformation, we should hurry up and catch up in order to adapt to the enterprise transformation. Industrialists and businessmen have lived a bourgeois life for a long time, and private ownership and individualism are quite serious. Therefore, we must undergo meticulous and long-term ideological transformation in order to gradually transform into a glorious laborer, and the main key to this lies in one's own consciousness and self-education. We should not be satisfied with the status quo and stagnate in today's high tide of socialist revolution. Because we are only beginning to enter socialist society today, which is not equivalent to building a socialist society; our industrialists and businessmen enthusiastically accepting socialist transformation is not equivalent to completely completing socialist transformation. Therefore, we must continue to work hard and constantly pursue progress. On the one hand, we should educate and temper ourselves by participating in joint state-private enterprises, specialized companies, and other social activities; on the other hand, we must also strive to study the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the state, study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and carry out criticism and self-criticism to transform our thinking.
    Carrying out the transformation of people in the industrialists and businessmen is an important task for the industrial and commercial circles in the future. The backbone elements of the industrial and commercial circles and the members of the China National Democratic Construction Association are the backbone in self-education and self-transformation, and should play a leading and bridging role. They should promote and organize industrialists and businessmen to learn, and constantly help other industrialists and businessmen improve their ideological understanding of patriotism and collectivism, learn politics, current affairs, and national policies, learn the business management methods and production skills of socialist enterprises, and promote industrialists and businessmen to participate in political activities and social activities, so that new activists in the industrial and commercial circles can continue to emerge, and all industrialists and businessmen can gradually change from an exploiter to a self-reliant working people of socialist society.
    I have gained a lot of knowledge and education at this meeting, and heard many valuable instructions from the leaders. In the future, I will definitely convey the spirit of the meeting to the masses of industrial and commercial circles I am connected with, so that we can jointly unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and strive to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule, and strive to successfully complete the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland. I wish the conference a successful success and everyone good health!

    叶雨田的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，并同意郭沫若副主席关于“在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命”的报告、陈叔通副主席关于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的报告、董必武副主席关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告，和陈伯达委员的报告。
    我是西安市的一个工商业者，我想就私营工商业的社会主义改造方面，谈一些情况和意见。
    随着农业合作化运动高潮的展开，私营工商业的社会主义改造也进入了高潮。西安市私营工商业在当地党政的具体领导和职工同志的推动下，从去年12月份开始，到今年1月13日，已全部实现了公私合营。这是国家和平改造资本主义工商业的伟大胜利的一个部分。
    最近一个多月来，西安市浸沉在一片欢乐之中，工商业者都为自己走进了社会主义大门而欢呼。1月15日，全市举行了10多万人的庆祝大会，工商业者和职工群众汇集在一起游行。许多工商业者的眷属也参加了游行，她们为自己的亲人走上了光明大道而愉快地在大街上、在人群中扭秧歌。这种景象是过去任何时期所没有的。
    在全行业实行公私合营的过程中，我体会到：第一，做好思想动员是做好一切工作的基础。我们根据全国工商联执委会议的精神，在工商界进行了传达和学习。由于这项工作做的比较全面，比较深入，工商业者对于自己的前途有了明确的认识，因而提高了接受社会主义改造的积极性。具体表现在下列三方面：（1）当全行业实行公私合营工作展开后，立即掀起了热潮，普遍地申请公私合营；（2）在清产估价中，一般都能本着实事求是、公平合理的精神进行工作；（3）不少工商业者为了表示接受改造的热忱，自愿把账外资金投入企业，截至1月中旬，据不完全的统计，已有8万余元。第二，要重视核心分子的力量。在全行业公私合营的高潮中，核心分子积极带头，努力工作，宣传政策，以身作则，带动群众前进，因而使很多工商业者打破了顾虑，积极投入社会主义改造的运动中去。第三，必须动员各方面的社会力量。在青年团和民主青年联合会的动员和教育下，许多青年工商业者热情极为高涨，成为工商界改造运动的一支新生力量；民主妇联也发动工商业者的家属参加学习，鼓励她们积极帮助自己的亲人接受改造，也起了相当的作用。这都充分证明了党和政府政策的正确和群众觉悟的提高。
    在全行业公私合营以后，已经改变了企业的生产关系，但是企业改造只是私营工商业社会主义改造的一个方面，更重要的是工商业者的思想改造。因为我们的思想认识是往往落在企业改造的后面的，我们应当赶紧赶上去，才能和企业改造相适应。工商业者长期过着资产阶级生活，私有观念和个人主义思想是相当严重的。因此，必须经过细致的、长期性的思想改造，才能逐步转变为一个光荣的劳动者，而它的主要关键是在于本人的自觉和自我教育。我们不应当在今天社会主义革命的高潮中，满足现状，停滞不前。因为我们今天只是开始进入了社会主义社会，并不等于建成了社会主义社会；我们工商业者热诚地接受社会主义改造，并不等于彻底完成了社会主义改造。所以，我们还必须要继续努力，不断追求进步，一方面在参加公私合营企业、专业公司以及其他社会活动中教育自己，锻炼自己；另一方面还必须努力学习中国共产党和国家的政策，学习马克思列宁主义的理论，展开批评和自我批评，来改造我们的思想。
    在工商业者中进行人的改造，是今后工商界一项重要的任务。工商界的骨干分子、民建会员是自我教育、自我改造中的骨干，应该起带头作用和桥梁作用，应当推动和组织工商业者进行学习，不断地帮助其他工商业者提高爱国主义和集体主义的思想认识，学习政治、时事和国家政策，学习社会主义企业的经营管理方法和生产技能，推动工商业者参加政治活动和社会活动，使工商界的新的积极分子能够不断地涌现出来，使所有的工商业者都能够从一个剥削者逐步改变为自食其力的社会主义社会的劳动人民。
    我在这次会议上得到了很多知识和教育，听到了许多首长宝贵的指示。今后，我一定要把会议的精神传达给我所连系的工商界群众，让我们共同紧密团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为提前完成第一个五年计划，为胜利完成祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业而奋斗。敬祝大会胜利成功，各位健康！
