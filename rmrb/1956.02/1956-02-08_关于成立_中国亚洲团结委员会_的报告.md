To the Members and Comrades:

I am entrusted by the Chinese Preparatory Committee of the Asian Countries Conference, and now I take this opportunity to report on matters related to the Asian Solidarity Committee.

From April 6th to 10th last year (1955), the Asian Countries Conference was held in New Delhi, the capital of India. More than 200 representatives from all walks of life from 16 countries including Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, China, Egypt, India, Japan, Jordan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Lebanon, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Syria, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam participated in the meeting. This conference was convened in accordance with the common aspirations of the people of Asian countries to strive for and safeguard national independence and freedom, oppose colonialism, oppose atomic and hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, eliminate the threat of a new war, uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and demand friendly cooperation between Asian countries. The conference passed resolutions that conformed to the common aspirations of the people of Asian countries and issued a major call to defend Asian peace. The conference also decided to establish the Asian Solidarity Committee to carry out liaison between Asian countries and promote the implementation of the conference resolutions. And the original preparatory committees of the Asian Countries Conference in various countries were responsible for establishing the Asian Solidarity Committees in various countries to publicize and implement the resolutions of the conference.

The people of many Asian countries have long suffered the disasters and pains caused by colonial rule. Even now, many Asian people are still under imperialist oppression, living a hard life.

At present, the aggressive bloc headed by the United States is not reconciled to its failures in Korea and Vietnam, and is still creating tensions in the Asian region. It continues to undermine the armistice agreements in Korea and Vietnam; organizes aggressive military blocs in Southeast Asia and the Middle East; and in Japan and many other places in Asia, the United States has established hundreds of military bases; and the US armed forces are occupying our territory of Taiwan, creating tensions in the Taiwan region and threatening peace in Asia. Colonialists vainly attempt to maintain their precarious colonial rule in certain regions of Asia by means of war.

However, today's Asia is no longer yesterday's Asia. The people of Asian countries who have freed themselves or are freeing themselves from the shackles of colonialism have awakened. They want to control their own destiny. They are resolutely fighting against colonialism, against war, for the attainment and maintenance of independence and freedom, and to defend peace. The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and their unwavering efforts to consolidate peace, the firm will of the people of India, Burma, Indonesia and other countries to safeguard independence and support the cause of peace, the Arab people's tenacious struggle to defend national independence and resist military blocs, and the Japanese people's powerful momentum to strive for peace, democracy, independence and freedom, and to oppose military bases and atomic weapons, all prove the great strength of the people of Asian countries against colonialism and against war. This vigorously developing force will surely lead to the complete defeat of colonialists and war threateners.

The people of Asian countries are willing to be friendly and united with each other and coexist peacefully. They have suffered the same hardships in the past, and now they are fighting for the same goals. They are willing to understand and help each other intimately. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China and India, and China and Burma have been warmly supported by the vast people of Asian countries, and they are willing to work hard to implement these five principles. The resolutions of the Asian Countries Conference embody the common aspirations of the people of Asian countries. Shortly after the Asian Countries Conference, the historic Asian-African Conference held in Bandung, Indonesia from April 18th to 24th last year, further reflected the common aspirations and demands of the people of Asia and Africa. The ten principles in the declaration of the Asian-African Conference, which were derived and developed from the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have not only been universally supported by the people of Asian and African countries, but also warmly supported by the people of other regions of the world. The "Bandung Spirit" that advocates peaceful coexistence and opposes colonialism, like the "Geneva Spirit" that advocates easing international tensions and resolving international disputes through consultation, has penetrated into the hearts of the people of Asia, Africa and other countries around the world. The people of Asia and Africa, who have suffered deeply from colonial rule, have a deeper understanding of the "Bandung Spirit."

Based on equality, mutual benefit, mutual assistance and cooperation, the friendly and united relations between Asian countries are developing day by day, economic and cultural exchanges are expanding, and the mutual exchanges between people from all walks of life in various countries are becoming more and more frequent. The friendly visits of political leaders of various countries have further enhanced the cooperation between Asian countries in striving for peace and international security.

In order to further strengthen their mutual friendship, unity, and peaceful coexistence, the people of Asian countries feel that they need to establish a permanent body to promote this work. The Asian Solidarity Committee established by the Asian Countries Conference was created to meet this need. The Asian Solidarity Committee headquarters is located in India, and Indian friends are entrusted to preside over the liaison.

After the Asian Countries Conference, the preparatory committees of various countries of the Asian Countries Conference carried out the work of preparing for and establishing the Asian Solidarity Committees of various countries. Asian Solidarity Committees in India, Japan and other countries have been established one after another. India also convened the All-India Conference for Asian Solidarity in Hyderabad from October 21st to 23rd last year, calling for strengthening Asian unity and defending Asian and world peace. The Japanese Asian Solidarity Committee also decided to organize an "Asian Solidarity Delegation" to visit Asian and African countries to enhance the unity between the Japanese people and the people of Asian and African countries.

Before the Asian Countries Conference, China organized the Chinese Preparatory Committee of the Asian Countries Conference and sent a delegation headed by Guo Moruo to attend the Asian Countries Conference. After the Chinese delegation to the Asian Countries Conference returned to China, Guo Moruo, the head of the delegation, made a report at the joint meeting of heads of Chinese people's organizations on May 21st last year. The joint meeting of heads of Chinese people's organizations unanimously passed a resolution on supporting the resolutions of the Asian Countries Conference, believing that the resolutions of the Asian Countries Conference are a major call for defending peace in Asia at present, reflecting the common aspirations and demands of the people of Asian countries, and also demonstrating their firm will to defend peace and oppose aggression.

According to the decision of the Asian Countries Conference, the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee should be organized by the Chinese Preparatory Committee of the Asian Countries Conference. The Chinese Preparatory Committee of the Asian Countries Conference and various parties and people's organizations have consulted and decided to suggest to all representatives to establish the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee.

We firmly believe that the establishment of the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee will help enhance friendly cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries, and will help strengthen the unity of Asian countries. We Asian people have made great contributions in the struggle against war, against colonialism, and to defend peace in Asia and the world. In the future, under closer unity, we will exert greater strength. The close unity between the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries is a great guarantee to defeat colonialism, smash war conspiracies, and defend peace in Asia and the world.

    关于成立“中国亚洲团结委员会”的报告
    刘宁一
    各位委员、各位同志们：
    我受亚洲国家会议中国筹备委员会的委托，现在趁这个机会，报告一下有关亚洲团结委员会的事情。
      去年（1955年）4月6日至10日，曾经在印度首都新德里举行亚洲国家会议。参加会议的有缅甸、柬埔寨、锡兰、中国、埃及、印度、日本、约旦、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、黎巴嫩、蒙古、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、叙利亚、苏联、越南民主共和国等16个国家的各界人士代表200余人。这个会议，是依照亚洲各国人民争取和维护民族独立自由，反对殖民主义，反对原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，消除新战争的威胁，拥护和平共处五项原则，要求亚洲国家之间的友好合作的共同愿望而召开的。会议通过了符合于亚洲各国人民共同愿望的决议，发出了保卫亚洲和平的重大号召。会议又决定设立亚洲团结委员会，进行亚洲各国之间的联络和推行会议的决议。并且由原来的亚洲国家会议的各国筹备委员会负责设立各国的亚洲团结委员会，在各国宣传和贯彻会议的决议。
    亚洲很多国家的人民曾经长期遭受殖民主义统治所造成的灾难和痛苦。直到现在，还有不少亚洲人民还处在帝国主义压迫之下，过着苦难的日子。
    目前，以美国为首的侵略集团，不甘心于在朝鲜和越南的失败，仍在亚洲地区制造紧张局势。它不断破坏朝鲜和越南的停战协定；在东南亚和中近东组织侵略性的军事集团；在日本和亚洲其他许多地方，美国建立了成百上千的军事基地；美国武装部队又侵占着我国领土台湾，造成台湾地区的紧张局势，威胁亚洲的和平。殖民主义者妄想用战争的手段，在亚洲若干地区上维持其摇摇欲坠的殖民统治。
    可是，今天的亚洲已经不是昨天的亚洲了。已经挣脱或正在挣脱殖民主义枷锁的亚洲各国人民已经觉醒过来了。他们要把自己的命运掌握在自已的手里。他们坚强地在为反对殖民主义、反对战争、争取和维护独立自由、保卫和平而斗争着。中国人民解放台湾的决心和坚持不渝地对巩固和平的努力，印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等国人民对维护独立自主和支持和平事业的坚决意志，阿拉伯国家人民对捍卫民族独立和抗拒军事集团的顽强斗争，日本人民争取和平民主、独立自由及反对军事基地、反对原子武器的强大声势，这一切，都证明亚洲各国人民反对殖民主义、反对战争的巨大力量。这个蓬勃发展着的力量，必将使殖民主义者和战争威胁者彻底失败。
    亚洲各国人民都愿意相互之间友好团结，和平共处。他们过去受过同样的苦难，现在为着同样的目的而进行斗争。他们愿意亲切地互相了解，互相协助。中印、中缅所倡导的和平共处五项原则，已经为亚洲各国广大人民所热烈支持，他们都愿为进行这五项原则而努力。亚洲国家会议的决议，体现了亚洲各国人民的共同愿望。亚洲国家会议之后不久，于去年4月18日至24日在印度尼西亚万隆举行的具有历史意义的亚非会议，进一步反映了亚洲和非洲人民的共同愿望和要求。由和平共处五项原则所引申和发展的亚非会议的宣言中的十项原则，不仅获得亚洲和非洲各国人民的普遍拥护，也为世界其他地区各国人民所热烈支持。主张和平共处、反对殖民主义的“万隆精神”，正像主张和缓国际紧张局势和用协商方式解决国际争端的“日内瓦精神”一样，深入到亚洲、非洲及世界各国人民的心中。曾经饱受殖民统治苦难的亚洲和非洲人民，对“万隆精神”体会得更为深刻。
    亚洲各国之间在平等互利、互助合作的基础上，友好团结关系正日益发展着，经济交流和文化交流，正在不断扩大，各国各界人士的互相来往，也一天比一天频繁。各国政治领袖的互相友好访问，更加增进了亚洲国家之间争取和平和国际安全的合作。
    为进一步加强他们互相之间的友好团结、和平共处，亚洲各国人民觉得，他们需要建立一个常设的机构，以推进这一工作。亚洲国家会议所设立的亚洲团结委员会，正是为适应这个需要而产生的。亚洲团结委员会会址设在印度，并且委托印度朋友主持联络。
    亚洲国家会议的各国筹备委员会，在亚洲国家会议之后，进行了筹备和建立各国的亚洲团结委员会的工作。印度、日本等国的亚洲团结委员会已经相继成立。印度并且在去年10月21日至23日，在海德拉巴召开了全印争取亚洲团结会议，号召加强亚洲的团结，保卫亚洲和世界和平。日本的亚洲团结委员会并且决定组织“亚洲团结代表团”将访问亚洲和非洲各国，以增进日本人民同亚洲和非洲各国人民之间的团结。
    中国曾在亚洲国家会议之前，组织了亚洲国家会议中国筹备委员会，派遣了以郭沫若为首的代表团出席亚洲国家会议。出席亚洲国家会议中国代表团回国后，曾于去年5月21日在中国各人民团体负责人联席会议上，由郭沫若团长作了传达报告。中国各人民团体负责人联席会议一致通过了关于拥护亚洲国家会议决议的决议，认为亚洲国家会议的决议是当前保卫亚洲和平的重大号召，反映了亚洲各国人民的共同愿望和要求，也表现了他们保卫和平和反对侵略的坚决意志。
    根据亚洲国家会议的决定，应该由亚洲国家会议中国筹备委员会组织中国的亚洲团结委员会。亚洲国家会议中国筹备委员会和各党派、各人民团体协商决定向各位代表们建议成立中国亚洲团结委员会。
    我们深信，中国亚洲团结委员会的成立，必将有助于增进中国人民同亚洲各国人民之间的友好合作，有助于加强亚洲国家的团结。我们亚洲人民在反对战争、反对殖民主义、保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，已经作出了巨大的贡献，今后在更紧密的团结之下，必将发挥更大的力量。中国人民同亚洲各国人民的亲密的团结，是击败殖民主义、粉碎战争阴谋、保卫亚洲和世界和平的巨大保证。
