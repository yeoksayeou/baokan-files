Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

    I fully agree with and support the reports made by Premier Zhou and other leaders.

    Since liberation, I have seen the leaping progress of our country's construction, and I am truly filled with excitement. At today's conference, I will only discuss two points:

    First, let's talk about street work. These years, I have been in Tianjin. Not long after Tianjin was liberated, I participated in street work, serving as the leader of a residential group, and I still am to this day. In my personal experience, I have received a great deal of education in street work over the past few years, learned a lot from the masses, improved myself, and felt happy and honored to have done something beneficial for the residents. Because in the dozens of years I have worked, I have not done anything beneficial for the people. I feel like a sinner, so I feel that the more complex and busy things are, the lighter the burden of sin on my back becomes. It has also made me deeply realize that in the new society, as long as one loyally serves the people, any job is glorious and any effort is meaningful. At the same time, I have personally seen and experienced the unity, fraternity, mutual assistance, and cooperation of the residents, as well as family harmony. This has made me keenly aware that under the radiant light of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, a new social atmosphere has been established, the relationship between people has changed, and the filth left over from the old society is being gradually eliminated. These facts fill me with unparalleled excitement, making me work tirelessly in street work, and also making the broad masses of street residents support the Communist Party, love Chairman Mao, and consciously abide by policies and laws, and respond to the government's call. And the street cadres are generally able to wholeheartedly serve the residents, adopt patient educational methods towards the residents, accept mass supervision, and listen to mass opinions. In daily work, there are fundamentally no instances of treating street residents with a rude attitude. This enables the people to truly realize that the current government truly works for the people—planning for the people, relying on the people, approaching the people, and being a just, honest, and upright government of their own. Street workers are a bridge from top to bottom and from bottom to top. The people are the foundation of our socialist construction, and various policies and laws, as well as each movement, are like textbooks for the people to learn from. Every time a movement passes, it is a learning experience and a step forward. Not only that, but this work is related to every staff member in every position. Didn't Chairman Mao say that staff members should eat well and sleep well? I say we should add one more thing: smooth breathing. If the family is not harmonious, these three things cannot be obtained, so how can he do his job well? This is what I, as a street worker, am proud of and honored to be. Therefore, I would like to make a guarantee here: In the high tide of the socialist revolution, in the rapidly advancing construction of the country, in order to cooperate with various construction undertakings, I have decided to continue to do street work with more excitement and diligence, and to improve work methods, improve work efficiency, and do this work even better.

    Second, let's talk about the Taiwan issue. I fully support Premier Zhou's explanation of the Taiwan issue in his political report, and I am willing to contribute my own strength to the liberation of Taiwan. In his report, Premier Zhou called on all Kuomintang military and political personnel who have fled to Taiwan and overseas not to hesitate any longer and to take the path of peaceful liberation of Taiwan as soon as possible. He solemnly announced that all those who are willing to return to the mainland to visit relatives and friends, or to visit and study, are welcome to come to the mainland. And all those who are willing to take the path of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, no matter who they are, no matter how great their past crimes, will be treated leniently and their pasts will not be investigated. This clearly points out two paths for the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan: following the American aggressors is a dead end, and returning to the motherland has a bright future. Therefore, I would like to say a few words to the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, especially to my old friends of many years. Now is the time for them to recognize the advantages and disadvantages and wake up. As long as they are willing to return to the big family of the motherland, we welcome them. At the same time, since the Party and the People's Government have announced the policy and approach, they will surely say what they mean and do what they say. That is to say, the personnel who have fled to Taiwan must not hesitate and worry. Only by resolutely abandoning the dark and turning to the light, and standing under the banner of patriotism, can they control their own destiny. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and Taiwan will eventually return to the motherland. All the people who have fled to Taiwan must see this general trend so as not to make mistakes again and again, piling mistake upon mistake, following the aggressors to failure, or being sacrificed by them. I believe that these people will choose their correct path.

    Premier Zhou's broad call, which exceeds the sun and moon and encompasses the heavens and the earth, makes me unable to help but shout, "Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live our beloved Chairman Mao!"

    鹿钟麟的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意并且拥护周总理和各位首长的报告。
    解放以来，我看到了祖国建设事业在飞跃前进，心里真是无限兴奋。在今天大会上，我只谈两点：
    第一，谈谈街道工作。这些年来，我一直在天津。天津解放不久，我就参加了街道工作，担任居民小组组长，一直到现在。我个人体会，几年来在街道工作中受到了很大的教育，向群众学习所得不少，同时提高了自己，也由于真正为居民做了一些有益的事情而感到愉快，引为荣幸。因为我作了几十年的事，并没有给人民作出一点有益的事情来，我觉得我真是一个罪人，所以我感觉事情愈是复杂愈是繁忙，我背上的罪包袱就轻松得多了。并且使我深刻地认识到，在新社会里，只要忠诚为人民服务，任何一个工作岗位都是光荣的，任何一点努力都是有意义的。同时，我亲眼看见并亲身体验了居民群众的团结友爱，互助合作，家庭和睦，使我亲切的认识了，在共产党和毛主席的光辉照耀下，新的社会风气树立起来了，人与人之间的关系改变了，旧社会遗留的污毒正在逐步肃清着。这些事实，使我感到无比的兴奋，使我一直不知疲倦的来做街道工作，同时也使广大的街道居民群众都拥护共产党，热爱毛主席，并且自觉的遵守政策法令，响应政府号召。而街道干部同志们也一般能忠心耿耿为居民办事，对居民采取耐心教育的方法，并接受群众监督，倾听群众意见，在日常工作中根本看不见以粗暴态度对待街道居民的事例。这就使得人民群众真切地认识到现在的政府真是为人民办事——替人民打算，依靠人民，接近人民，公正廉明的人民自己的政府。街道工作者，是自上而下、自下而上的一座桥梁，民众是我们建设社会主义的基础，各种政策法令以及每项运动比作民众学习的课本，每经过一次运动就是学习一次，就得到一次的进步。不但如此，这项工作与每个岗位上的工作人员都有关系。毛主席不是说教工作人员吃得好、睡得好吗，我说还要加上一项气儿顺，倘若家庭不睦，这三样都是得不到的，那他的工作能做得好吗？这是我这个做街道工作的人引以自豪的，引以为光荣的。因此，我愿在这里提出保证：在社会主义革命的高潮中，在国家建设突飞猛进的今天，为配合各项建设事业，我决定更兴奋、更辛勤地继续做街道工作，而且要改进工作方法，提高工作效率，把这个工作做的更好。
    第二，谈谈台湾问题。我完全拥护周总理政治报告中关于台湾问题的说明，并愿为解放台湾而贡献自己的力量，周总理在报告中，号召一切跑到台湾和海外的国民党军政人员，莫再迟疑，早日走和平解放台湾的道路，并郑重宣布，凡是愿意回到大陆省亲会友的、参观学习的，都可以到大陆上来，而凡是愿意走和平解放台湾道路的，不管任何人、也不管他们过去犯过多大罪过，都将宽大对待，不究既往。这就很明白的给台湾的国民党军政人员指出了两条道路：跟美国侵略者走是死路一条，回到祖国乃前途远大。因此，我愿向台湾的国民党军政人员，特别是其中的多年的老朋友们，说几句话。现在正是他们认清利害幡然觉悟的时候了。只要他们愿回到祖国的大家庭，我们是欢迎的。同时，党和人民政府既已宣布了政策和作法，就必然说到哪里，作到哪里。这就是说，跑到台湾的人员们切莫仿徨顾虑，只有毅然决然，弃暗投明，站到爱国主义旗帜下来，才能掌握自己的命运。中国人民一定要解放台湾，台湾最后也必然归还祖国。一切跑到台湾的人们，必须看清这个大势，才不致一错再错，错上加错，跟着侵略者失败，或者被人牺牲。我相信这些人是会选择他们的正确道路的。
    周总理这个出乎日月之上包乎天地之外的宽大的号召，使我不由得要喊中国共产党万岁！敬爱的毛主席万岁！
