The nation will strive to basically eliminate ten major insect pests and diseases that severely damage crops, including locusts, armyworms, rice stem borers, corn borers, cotton aphids, cotton red spiders, cotton bollworms, wheat smut, wheat nematode disease, and sweet potato black rot, within seven years. This was proposed at the Ten Major Pest and Disease Control Planning Conference, which closed on the 4th, after specifically studying the problem of eliminating the most serious insect pests and diseases in the 1956-1967 National Agricultural Development Program (draft).

The conference made preliminary plans for eliminating each insect pest and disease. The conference believed that in addition to adopting various effective measures appropriate to local conditions and mobilizing the vast number of farmers to fight against pests and diseases, particular attention should be paid to promoting agricultural measures such as deep plowing, cleaning fields, and crop rotation. The conference proposed that in rice stem borer-affected areas, efforts should be concentrated on eliminating overwintering rice stem borers in rice roots, rice straw, and weeds; in areas with locusts, reconnaissance work should be done well to eliminate locusts before the third instar; for eliminating cotton bollworms, the central link of eliminating overwintering bollworms by cleaning cotton warehouses and fumigating cottonseed should be firmly grasped. The conference also proposed various control methods for eliminating cotton aphids, armyworms, corn borers, wheat smut, and sweet potato black rot.

The conference also studied aircraft pest control and further development of crop pest and disease forecasting and plant quarantine work, requiring the establishment of forecasting stations and pest and disease information points as the center, forming a mass pest and disease information network. In addition, the grassroots plant quarantine stations and plant protection research institutions in various provinces and regions will continue to be established and strengthened. This year's supply of pesticides and equipment will also increase several times compared to the total supply from 1950 to 1955.

The conference also studied the training of plant protection and quarantine personnel and strengthening the transmission of various pest and disease control technologies, and completed the review of ten booklets and wall charts guiding the control of ten major pests and diseases. These booklets and wall charts will be printed in large quantities starting in March of this year.

    全国争取七年内消灭十大虫害和病害
    全国将争取在7年内基本上消灭危害农作物十分严重的飞蝗、粘虫、水稻螟虫、玉米螟虫、棉蚜、棉红蜘蛛、棉红铃虫、麦类黑穗病、小麦线虫病、甘薯黑斑病等十大虫害和病害。这是4日闭幕的十大病虫防治规划会议，在具体研究了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）中关于消灭危害农作物最严重的虫害和病害的问题后提出的。
    这个会议对消灭每种虫害和病害都作了初步规划。会议认为，各地除了因地制宜地采用各种有效措施，发动广大农民向病虫害作斗争以外，特别要注意推广深耕、清洁田园和轮作等农业措施。会议提出，在稻螟为害地区，要集中力量消灭稻根、稻草和杂草中的越冬螟虫；在有飞蝗的地区，要做好侦察工作，将蝗虫消灭在三龄以前；对消灭棉红铃虫，要紧紧抓住清扫棉花仓库、棉籽熏蒸等办法消灭过冬红铃虫这一中心环节。对消灭棉蚜、粘虫、玉米螟虫、麦类黑穗病和甘薯黑斑病等虫害和病害，会议也都分别提出了各种防治方法。
    会议还研究了飞机治虫和进一步开展农作物病虫害预测预报和植物检疫工作，要求以正在建立的预测预报站和病虫情报点为中心，组成群众性的病虫情报网。此外，各省、区的基层植物检疫站和植物保护研究机构也将继续建立和加强。今年农药和药械的供应，也将比1950年到1955年供应总数增加几倍。
    会议对培养植物保护和检疫人材和加强对各种病虫害防治技术的传授工作也都作了研究，并且完成了指导防治十大病虫害的十个小册子和挂图的审定工作。这些小册子和挂图到今年3月份就可以陆续大量印行。
