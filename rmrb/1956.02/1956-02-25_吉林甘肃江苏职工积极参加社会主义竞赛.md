Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 24th: Workers, engineers, technicians, and administrative personnel in many factories and enterprises in Jilin Province are actively participating in socialist emulation drives. In the emulation, workers have put forward a large number of rationalization proposals, improved technology, and increased output and quality.

Workers in the Jilin Chemical Plant and three other units submitted more than 900 rationalization proposals in January. Workers and technicians in the electric carbide workshop of the Jilin Electric Carbide Plant promoted the advanced experience of rapid smelting, increasing electric carbide production by 1.6 times and improving quality. Workers at the Changchun Locomotive Depot of the Harbin Railway Administration implemented rapid traction methods, hauling more and running faster, saving a large amount of coal. They broke through the winter quota of hauling 2,400 tons and reached the summer operating chart's prescribed traction quota of 2,700 tons three months ahead of schedule. Qi Fenglin, a worker at the Jilin Agricultural Implement Factory, proposed more than 10 technical improvement suggestions, greatly exceeding the quota. Hu Nianrong, a lathe operator in the machine repair workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, created the "internal blind hole tool" in mid-January, increasing work efficiency by 30 times. Later, he improved the tools and operating methods for processing nickel-chromium-silicon steel pipes, further increasing the original maximum efficiency by 20%. Cao Cunchang, an engineer in the gearbox workshop of the same factory, proposed the use of the "chain teaching method" to train technical personnel. This method can be used to train a large number of technical personnel during the work process.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, February 24th: Socialist emulation drives have been launched in many factories, mines, and transportation industries in Gansu Province. In the past two months, workers in many factories and mines have continuously submitted rationalization proposals and examples of breaking through production quotas. The mechanical installation team of the Yumen Oil Mine put forward more than 600 rationalization proposals in three days when discussing production plans. Workers at the state-owned Lanzhou General Machinery Factory submitted more than 1,000 rationalization proposals in three days, from February 18th to 20th. New records are constantly emerging in production in previously backward local industries, such as machinery, woolen textiles, and flour milling.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 24th: A number of factories and mines in Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other cities in Jiangsu Province have already exceeded and completed their February production plans or their upper and middle ten-day production plans in the socialist emulation drive. Zang Youtong, a technician, and workers at the Jiangnan Mineral Powder Factory in Wuxi improved the powder screening equipment and material loading operations, increasing quartz sand production by nearly double and completing the monthly plan by the 20th.

When discussing the national plan, workers at the state-owned Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory made 243 rationalization proposals. The original annual plan was revised three times, and the man-hour quota was revised four times, ensuring the completion of the First Five-Year Plan in three years and seven months. Now, the workers in the forging workshop of this factory have all exceeded the revised new quota.

In Nanjing, among the 30 factories with more than 100 workers, 13 factories had more rationalization proposals in January than the total number for the entire past year. The number of rationalization proposals from the remaining 17 factories was also equivalent to half of last year's total.

    吉林甘肃江苏职工积极参加社会主义竞赛
    本报长春24日电　吉林省许多工厂企业的工人、工程技术人员和行政管理人员积极参加社会主义竞赛。职工们在竞赛中提出大量合理化建议，改进了技术，提高了产量和质量。
    吉林化工厂等4个单位的职工1月份共提出900多件合理化建议。吉林电石厂电石车间工人和技术人员推广快速熔炼的先进经验，提高电石产量一点六倍，并且提高了质量。哈尔滨铁路管理局长春机务段职工推行快速牵引方法，多拉快跑，节省大量燃煤，突破了牵引2，400吨的冬季定额，提前3个月达到夏季运行图所规定的2，700吨牵引定额。吉林省农具厂工人齐凤林提出10多项改进技术的建议，大大突破了定额。第一汽车制造厂机修车间车工胡年荣，在1月中旬曾经创造“掬管内眼刀”，提高工作效率三十倍。后来他又改进了镍铬矽钢钢管加工的刀具和操作方法，使原来的最高效率又提高了20％。这个工厂变速箱车间工程师曹存昌提出用“连锁传授法”培养技术人材的建议。采用这种方法可以在工作过程中培养出大批技术人材。
    据新华社兰州24日电　　社会主义竞赛已经在甘肃省许多厂矿、交通运输业中展开。许多厂矿企业近两个月来，职工们提出的合理化建议和突破生产定额的事例不断出现。玉门油矿机械安装队在讨论生产规划时，3天内就提出了600多条合理化建议；国营兰州通用机器厂在2月18日到20日的3天内，工人们共提出了1，000多条合理化建议。过去生产上比较落后的地方工业中，如机器业、毛纺织业和面粉业，生产上都不断地出现新纪录。
    据新华社南京24日电　　江苏省南京、无锡、苏州等市一批厂矿已经在社会主义竞赛中，超额和提前完成了2月份生产计划或上、中旬生产计划。无锡市江南矿石制粉厂技术员臧友桐和工人研究改进了粉筛设备和加料操作，使石英砂产量提高近一倍，到20日就完成了月计划。
    国营无锡柴油机厂在讨论国家计划的时候，职工提了243条合理化建议，原来编制的年度计划被修改了3次，工时定额修改了4次，保证3年7个月完成第一个五年计划。现在这个厂的锻工车间的工人又全部突破了被修改以后的新定额。
    南京市30个百人以上的工厂中，有13个工厂职工在1月份提出的合理化建议件数超过去年全年总数。其余17个工厂的合理化建议件数也相等于去年半年的总数。
