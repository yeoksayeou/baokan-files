    Rural Areas of Jiangxi Province Launch Campaign to Eliminate Pests
    A campaign to eliminate pests is underway in rural areas of Jiangxi Province. From December of last year to mid-January of this year, incomplete statistics from the Nanchang, Jiujiang, Fuzhou, and Ji'an Special Zones alone show that more than 120 tigers, more than 170 wild boars, and more than 40 other wild animals have been killed.
    In order to encourage farmers to eliminate pests and ensure that crops and draught animals are not harmed by wild animals, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee has formulated reward measures for eliminating pests. The measures stipulate that a reward of 30 yuan will be given for each tiger or leopard killed, and the hunter can dispose of the carcass themselves. Those injured in the pest elimination campaign will receive free medical treatment from the state. (Gao Jingchun Zhao Chuandi)

    江西省农村展开消灭害兽运动
    江西省各地农村正在开展一个消灭害兽运动。从去年12月到今年1月中旬，仅据南昌、九江、抚州、吉安4个专区不完全的统计，已经打死老虎120多只，野猪170多只，其他野兽40多只。
    为了鼓励农民消灭害兽，保证农作物和耕畜不受野兽侵害，江西省人民委员会制定了消灭害兽的奖励办法。办法中规定，每打死一头老虎或豹子得奖金30元，猎物也自行处理；在消灭害兽运动中受伤的人，由国家免费予以治疗。（高景春　赵传弟）
