Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 14th: Egyptian Minister of State Sadat published an article in "The Republic," welcoming the agreement reached between the Soviet Union and Egypt regarding Soviet assistance in establishing a nuclear physics laboratory in Egypt. Sadat said that the establishment of this nuclear physics laboratory will enable Egypt to "utilize nuclear energy for prosperity rather than for making bombs."

He said that the agreement with the Soviet Union was signed in accordance with Egypt's policy of cooperation with all countries. After the Bandung Conference, Asian and African countries that have been and are breaking free from foreign shackles are very concerned about developing their industries. The Soviet Union provides assistance to backward countries based on purely commercial terms of mutual benefit and offers many preferential terms in payment, without demanding political obligations, unlike Western countries that demand participation in treaties and the conclusion of "common security" agreements in exchange for their assistance.

Sadat said that we hope to build our national economy and are willing to cooperate with all those who wish to cooperate and follow the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, that is, to cooperate with those who do not impose political conditions on us, do not interfere in our affairs, and do not oppress us.

    埃及国务部长萨达特
    欢迎苏联帮助埃及建立核子物理实验所
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社开罗14日讯　：埃及国务部长萨达特在“共和国报”上发表文章，欢迎苏联和埃及在苏联帮助埃及建立核子物理实验所问题上达成协议。萨达特说，建立这个核子物理实验所将使埃及能够“为繁荣而不是为制造炸弹而利用核子能”。
    他说，同苏联的协议是根据埃及同所有国家合作的政策签订的。在万隆会议以后，已经和正在挣脱外国束缚的亚非国家十分关心发展它们的工业。苏联根据互惠的纯粹商业条件援助落后国家，并且在支付方面给予许多优待，不要求承担政治义务，不像西方国家要求以参加条约和缔结“共同安全”协定的条件换取它们的援助。
    萨达特说，我们希望建立我们的民族经济，并且愿意同所有希望合作而且遵循万隆会议的决议的人进行合作，也就是说，同不以政治条件强加在我们身上、不干涉我们的事务和不压迫我们的人进行合作。
