Absolutely Do Not Plow Up Wheat Seedlings
Gao Changren
This year, Huanghua District, Changsha County, Hunan Province plans to expand the planting of double-cropping rice to 75% of the entire district. To achieve this goal, the Huanghua District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan "Everything for 75% Double-Cropping Rice." Because some fields were planted with wheat, affecting the completion of the double-cropping rice expansion plan, they called on farmers to plow up the wheat seedlings and increase the planting of double-cropping rice. As a result, many agricultural cooperatives in the district planned to plow up wheat seedlings.

However, this matter aroused opposition from some members of the agricultural cooperatives. Because most of the wheat in the cooperatives now belongs to new members; and these new members are mostly impoverished households who are short of food this spring, and they rely on the wheat harvest to solve the food shortage problem (although the green seedlings have already been priced and returned to the cooperative, they can borrow from the cooperative in advance when the time comes). The district cadres only thought about completing the expansion of 75% of the double-cropping rice, but did not consider the situation of these members.

Wan Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee of the district, discovered this problem in the "Xinglong" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huanghua Township. He and the members jointly worked out a method to increase production without plowing up the wheat seedlings, which is to strengthen the management of the existing wheat fields, advance the maturity period of wheat, and then plant intercropped double-cropping rice after the wheat is harvested. In this way, although less rice will be harvested than planned with continuous double-cropping rice, more wheat will be harvested, and the grain can be eaten a few months earlier, solving the food shortage problem for some members. This method was unanimously supported by the members. The directors of all 22 fully socialist agricultural cooperatives in the district agreed to do so, and the cooperatives that originally planned to plow up wheat seedlings also canceled the plan.

This matter shows that while we must have a grand vision and long-term plans when leading agricultural production, we must combine the long-term interests of the masses with their immediate interests. Only looking at today and not tomorrow is shortsighted; but only looking at tomorrow and not considering the current specific situation is also wrong.

    千万不可犁掉麦苗
    高长任
    湖南省长沙县黄花区今年计划在全区扩种75％的双季稻。为了达到这个目的，中共黄花区委会提出了“一切为了75％的双季稻的口号”。因为有些田播种了小麦，影响扩种双季稻计划的完成，他们就号召农民犁掉麦苗，增种双季稻。因此，这个区许多农业合作社都计划犁掉麦苗。
    可是这件事情却引起了农业合作社一部分社员的反对。因为现在社里的麦子大部分是新社员的；这些新社员又大都是今年春天还缺口粮的贫困户，他们指靠着收了麦子解决缺口粮的问题（虽然青苗已经折价归社，但到时候他们可以向社里预借）。区干部们只想到完成扩种75％的双季稻，却没有考虑这些社员的情况。
    这个区的区委副书记万国华在黄花乡“兴隆”农业生产合作社发现了这个问题。他和社员们共同研究出一个不犁掉麦苗也能增产的办法，那就是加强对现有麦田的管理，提早小麦的成熟期，等收了麦子再种间作双季稻。这样，虽然比计划中的连作双季稻要少收一些稻谷，但却多收了麦子，而且可以提前几个月吃到粮食，解决一部分社员缺口粮的问题。这个办法得到了社员的一致拥护。全区22个完全社会主义性质的农业合作社的社主任都同意这样做法，原来准备犁掉麦苗的社也取消了犁掉麦苗的计划。
    这件事情说明：我们领导农业生产固然要有远大的眼光、长远的计划，但这必须把群众的长远利益和眼前利益结合起来。只看今天不看明天是眼光短浅；但只看明天不顾当前的具体情况，同样是不对的。
