Xinhua News Agency, February 18th. His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, delivered a radio speech to the Chinese people tonight. The full text of the speech is as follows:

    Greetings to the dearest friends – the Chinese people!
    I am very grateful to your government and your broadcasting organization for giving me this opportunity to let all of you residing in China's vast and beautiful land hear my voice.
    My voice is also the voice of the five million Khmer citizens living in Cambodia, a country very close to your country, irrigated by the Mekong River, a great river originating in China. Since the first century AD, many Chinese diplomats, merchants, and writers have visited Cambodia.
    Cambodia was referred to as Funan and Zhenla by Chinese writers in the third century. Funan refers to northern Cambodia, and Zhenla refers to southern Cambodia.
    Thanks to the introduction of our ancient Chinese friends, the rest of the world learned about Cambodia's culture, customs, habits, and history. Among these Chinese scholars, the most famous are Kang Tai and Zhu Ying (245-250 AD) and Zhou Daguan at the end of the 13th century.
    Today, you still have more than 300,000 compatriots living in Cambodia, whom we regard with brotherly affection. I mention these simple facts to show you how pleased the delegation I am honored to lead is to come to your country for an official visit and bring the respects of the Cambodian people.
    Our people bring you greetings of friendship, trust, and peace.
    The Cambodian people believe the Chinese people are striving for social progress.
    The Cambodian people believe that this country with a population of 600 million is determined to maintain peace.
    After I return to Cambodia, I will tell our people that their trust in you is correct.
    Under the leadership of your beloved Chairman Mao Zedong, you have already expressed your determination to build the country with actions and have achieved admirable achievements in the social, cultural, and economic fields. These achievements are all achievements of peace.
    We believe that these achievements will always be achievements of peace, and their purpose is only for the happiness of the Chinese people.
    We also believe that the friendship between our two countries and the brotherly ties between our two peoples will inevitably be strengthened in the future.
    This will be the noblest contribution our two peoples make to easing the international situation, understanding between countries, mutual trust and rapprochement, that is, to lasting world peace.
    Long live the Chinese people!
    Long live Sino-Cambodian friendship!

    西哈努克对中国人民的广播演讲
    新华社18日讯　柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克亲王殿下应中央人民广播电台的邀请，今晚向中国人民发表广播演讲。演讲全文如下：
    向最亲爱的朋友——中国人民致敬！
    我非常感谢你们的政府和你们的广播机构给我这个机会，让居住在中国广阔美丽的土地上的你们全体听到我的声音。
    我的声音也就是居住在柬埔寨的500万高棉公民的声音，我们国家同你们国家很接近，发源于中国的大河流——湄公河灌溉着这个国家。公元一世纪以来，许多中国的外交人员、商人和著作家都访问过柬埔寨。
    柬埔寨被第三世纪的中国著作家称做扶南和真腊，扶南指柬埔寨北部，真腊指柬埔寨南部。
    由于中国古代的朋友们的介绍，世界其他国家知道了柬埔寨的文化、风俗、习惯和历史，在这些中国学者中，最有名的有康泰和朱应（公元245年到250年）以及13世纪末叶的周达观。
    今天，你们还有30多万同胞生活在柬埔寨，我们以兄弟般的情谊看待他们。我所以提到这些简单的事实，是要向你们说明：对于前来贵国作正式访问并且给你们带来柬埔寨人民的敬意的，我所荣幸地率领的代表团感到多么的高兴。
    我国人民给你们带来友爱、信任和和平的致意。
    柬埔寨人民相信，中国人民是在为社会进步而努力。
    柬埔寨人民相信，这个拥有6亿人口的国家决心维护和平。
    我回到柬埔寨以后，要告诉我国人民，他们对你们的信任是正确的。
    在你们敬爱的毛泽东主席的领导下，你们已经用行动表达了你们建设国家的决心，在社会、文化和经济方面获得了令人钦羡的成就。这些成就都是和平的成就。
    我们相信，这些成就将永远是和平的成就，它们的目的只是为了中国人民的幸福。
    我们同样相信，我们两国之间的友谊，和我们两国人民之间兄弟般的联系今后必将日益加强。
    这将是我们两国人民对于缓和国际局势、各国之间的了解、互相信任和接近，也就是对于世界的持久和平，所作出的最崇高的贡献。
    中国人民万岁！
    柬中友好万岁！
