    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's report and fully agree with the reports on various issues made by other leading comrades. I am willing to work hard for the tasks proposed in these reports.
    Currently, our country is undergoing a profound socialist revolution. From cities to villages, tremendous changes are taking place every day and every hour. "The high tide of agricultural cooperation throughout the country is triggering a high tide of agricultural production, which in turn promotes the high tide of the entire national economy and scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings." The cooperation of handicrafts and the joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce are also entering a high tide. China's socialist industry and commerce are advancing by leaps and bounds. The working class, with high production enthusiasm, has launched a labor competition to complete and overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. These thriving scenes demonstrate the bright future of the motherland and inspire the people of the whole country to head towards socialism.
    At this time, it is of great historical significance that the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is holding its second plenary session. I am participating in this meeting with joy and excitement, and in the meeting, I deeply rejoice that I have received a profound socialist ideological education.
    I am a former soldier, and now I am engaged in local sports leadership work. Under the care and help of the party and government leaders of Anhui Province, I have learned a lot of new things and feel sincerely happy. As a sports worker, I am still a student, but I deeply know the importance of sports work for socialist construction. Sports is in the vital interests of the people, is an integral part of cultural and educational undertakings, and is closely related to health undertakings. In particular, it plays an effective guarantee role for national defense and production. It is also one of the important means to carry out communist moral education for students and cultivate the next generation into well-rounded talents for future construction. At the same time, in international cultural exchanges and international peace movements, sports is the best form with a rich international character.
    Anhui Province's sports work has always followed Chairman Mao's "three good" and the teaching of "develop sports and enhance the people's physique," and takes the Party Central Committee's instruction "launch mass sports and gradually popularize and regularize it" as its guiding principle. In recent years, it has achieved certain results. The main manifestations are: (1) The development of sports in factories and mines has enriched the culture of workers, strengthened their physique, and improved labor productivity; (2) In schools, the implementation of the labor-defense system has strengthened students' patriotism and collectivism education, and improved students' health levels and learning outcomes. The incidence of disease in many schools has been significantly reduced, and medical expenses have changed from overspending to surplus. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work, mainly due to insufficient estimation of the overall development of the country, especially manifested in the weakness of rural sports leadership. Due to the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the broad masses of peasants—especially young men and women in rural areas—urgently demand sports activities. In some areas, they have already started on their own. Faced with this new situation, we must catch up with the leadership work and take the provision of Article 29 of the National Agricultural Development Program put forward by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, "... basically achieve sports fields in every township in seven or twelve years and popularize rural sports activities" as our future goal for carrying out sports in rural areas.
    Through this meeting, we can clearly see that the current international situation is conducive to world peace and conducive to our socialist construction. However, the tense situation caused by U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory—Taiwan—still exists, and eight million Taiwanese compatriots are still in dire straits, not yet returned to the embrace of the motherland. To this end, we must strengthen our efforts in all aspects and fight to the end to achieve the complete reunification of the motherland. On the issue of liberating Taiwan, I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's call and solemn announcement at this meeting to the Kuomintang military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan and overseas. I also advise these people here, especially my old friends among them: This is the best opportunity for you to come to your senses, and strive to liberate Taiwan through peaceful means!
    Our motherland is moving forward. We must improve our political and professional level and devote more hard work to the construction of the motherland; we must continue to be vigilant and eliminate all overt and covert counter-revolutionaries; we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and strengthen self-ideological reform. The people of the whole country should unite, closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and advance under the glorious banner of socialism! Advance!

    戴戟的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的报告，并完全同意其他领导同志们所作有关各项问题的报告，并愿为这些报告所提出的任务而努力。
    目前，我国已经历着一个深刻的社会主义革命运动，从城市到乡村都在每日每时地发生着巨大变化。“全国农业合作化的高潮正在引起全国农业生产的高潮，并转而促进整个国民经济和科学、文化、教育、卫生等事业的高潮。”全国手工业的合作化和资本主义工商业的公私合营，也跟着进入了高潮。我国的社会主义工商业正在突飞猛进，工人阶级以高度的生产热情，展开了提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的劳动竞赛。这些如火如荼的景象，展示了祖国灿烂前途，鼓舞着全国人民奔向社会主义。
    在这个时候，中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会召开第二次全体会议，是有重要历史意义的。我以欢欣鼓舞的心情来参加这次会议，在会议中，深自庆幸我受到了深刻的社会主义思想教育。
    我是一个旧军人，现在担任着地方的体育领导工作。在安徽省党政领导的关怀和帮助下，我学习了不少新的东西，衷心地感到幸福。作为一个体育工作者，我还是一个学生，但我深知道，体育工作对于社会主义建设的重要意义。体育事业是人民的切身利益，是文化、教育事业的组成部分，与卫生事业有着紧密的联系。特别重要的，它对国防、生产起着有效的保证作用。它还是对学生进行共产主义道德品质教育、培养下一代为全面发展未来建设人材的重要手段之一。同时，在国际文化交流和国际和平运动中，体育运动又是一个富有世界性的最好形式。
    安徽省的体育工作，一直遵循着毛主席的“三好”和“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的教导，以党中央所指示“展开群众性运动，并逐步使之普及和经常化”为方针，几年来是有一定成绩的。主要表现在：（一）工矿方面体育运动的发展，丰富了职工的文化，加强了职工的体质，提高了劳动生产率；（二）学校方面由于推行了劳卫制，加强了学生的爱国主义和集体主义教育，提高了学生的健康水平和学习效果，许多学校发病率显著减低，医药费由超支变为结余。但我们的工作仍存在着许多缺点，主要是对国家整个情况的发展估计不足，特别表现在对农村体育领导工作的薄弱方面。由于农业合作化的高潮，广大农民群众——特别是农村的男女青年，迫切地要求体育活动。有些地区他们已经亲自动手开展起来了。面临着这一新的情况，我们必须把领导工作赶上去，并把中共中央政治局提出的全国农业发展纲要第二十九条“……在七年或者十二年内基本上做到乡乡有体育场，普及农村体育活动”的规定，作为我们今后在农村开展体育运动的奋斗目标。
    通过这次会，使我们清楚看到，目前国际形势是有利于世界和平，有利于我们的社会主义建设。但由于美帝国主义侵占我国领土——台湾而造成的紧张局势仍然存在，八百万台湾同胞仍在水深火热之中，没有回到祖国的怀抱。为此，我们必须加强各方面的努力，为实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗到底。对解放台湾问题，我完全拥护周恩来总理在这次会议上向跑到台湾和海外的国民党军政人员的号召和郑重宣布。我在这里也劝告这些人们，特别是其中我的旧朋友们：这是你们幡然悔悟最好的机会，为争取通过和平途径解放台湾而努力吧！
    我们祖国正在前进。我们必须提高政治业务水平为祖国建设事业付出更大的辛勤；我们必须继续提高警惕，肃清一切公开和暗藏的反革命分子；我们必须加强马克思列宁主义的学习，加强自我思想改造。全国人民大团结起来，紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，在社会主义的光辉旗帜下前进！前进！
