Xinhua News Agency, 10th - China and Belgium signed a contract for Belgium to supply China with nitrogen fertilizer. Mr. Thierie, the manager of the Belgian Nitrogen Fertilizer Union, arrived in Beijing on February 1st to negotiate the supply of nitrogen fertilizer with the China National Import and Export Corporation. After friendly discussions between the two parties, a contract was signed on the 10th for the Belgian Nitrogen Fertilizer Union to supply China with 425,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer during the 1956-1957 fertilizer year.

    Paton, the general manager of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong, also signed a contract with the China National Import and Export Corporation on the same day to supply 60,000 tons of chemical fertilizer.

    Xinhua News Agency, 10th - Mr. Thierie, the manager of the Belgian Nitrogen Fertilizer Union, told Xinhua reporters today that he is very confident about the prospects for Sino-Belgian trade development.

    Thierie signed a contract with the China National Import and Export Corporation this noon to supply China with 425,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer during the 1956-1957 fertilizer year. He said: "This is the largest chemical fertilizer supply contract in the world. I am very satisfied with this."

    The manager of the Belgian Nitrogen Fertilizer Union said that his company has been supplying chemical fertilizer to China for 25 years. Now, under the conditions of the Chinese People's Government vigorously developing agriculture, this trade has achieved significant development. He also said: "You can believe that new and larger contracts will be signed every year in the future."

    The Belgian businessman ridiculed the "embargo" imposed on others by the United States, saying: "This is naive and unrealistic." He said: "If some countries are unwilling to sell things to China, then China can buy them from other countries, and soon you will see that China can manufacture those things itself."

    Thierie arrived in Beijing on February 1st. He will take a plane to Guangzhou on the 11th and then transfer to Hong Kong.

    我国和比利时签订由比利时供应我国氮肥的合同
    比利时氮肥联合公司经理谈中比贸易发展前途
    新华社10日讯　比利时氮肥联合公司经理蒂伊埃在1日到达北京同中国进出口公司进行供应氮肥的谈判。经过双方友好的洽谈以后，在10日签订了一个由比利时氮肥联合公司在1956—1957肥料年度供应中国425，000吨氮肥的合同。
    香港怡和洋行总经理巴顿同一天也同中国进出口公司签订了一个供应60，000吨化学肥料的合同。
    新华社10日讯　比利时氮肥联合公司经理蒂伊埃今天对新华社记者说，他对中比贸易发展前途很有信心。
    蒂伊埃今天中午同中国进出口公司签订了一项在1956至1957肥料年度中，供应中国425，000吨氮肥的合同。他说：“这是世界上最大的一个化学肥料供应合同。我对这件事感到非常满意。”
    这位比利时氮肥联合公司的经理说，他的公司供应中国化学肥料已经有25年的历史。现在，在中国人民政府大力发展农业的条件下，这一项贸易才得到显著的发展。他又说：“你可以相信，今后每年都会签订新的、更大的合同。”
    这位比利时商人嘲笑美国强加在别人头上的“禁运”说：“这是幼稚的、毫不现实的事。”他说：“假如有些国家不愿意卖东西给中国，那么中国可以从别的国家买到，而不久之后，你就会看见中国自己也能制造那些东西了。”
    蒂伊埃是在2月1日到达北京的。他将在11日乘飞机去广州转赴香港。
