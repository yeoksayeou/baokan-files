Guangxi Province has decided to build a provincial road network within seven years, starting in 1956. By 1962, the total mileage of roads open to traffic in the province will reach 40,000 kilometers (excluding wide-gauge roads). From 1956 to 1957, 10,000 kilometers of simple roads will be built, of which 4,000 kilometers will be completed in 1956. In addition, there are plans to renovate suburban and rural roads, improve bridges and ferries, and ensure that all county towns, industrial and mining areas, major market towns, state-owned farms, tractor stations, and large agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province have access to roads. This was determined in the plan to build a provincial road network made at the recently held Guangxi Provincial Transportation Conference. (Xinqin)

    广西省作出修建道路网的规划
    广西省决定从1956年开始，在7年内修成全省的道路网，到1962年全省公路通车里程将达到4万公里（不包括大车道），1956年到1957年将修建简易公路1万公里，其中1956年要修成4，000公里。此外并有计划地整修市郊公路和乡村道路，改善桥梁、渡口，使全省各县城、工矿区、主要圩镇、国营农场、拖拉机站和大型农业生产合作社等都有公路可通。这是在最近召开的广西省全省交通会议上作出的修建全省道路网的规划中确定的。（辛勤）
