Intensify Propaganda to Complete the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
Wang Zhanye

    Currently, workers in various industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments are launching a socialist emulation campaign to strive for the early and overfulfillment of the Five-Year Plan. If the Party organization's propaganda and mobilization work can closely follow the socialist emulation movement, and be good at utilizing the new people and new events that have emerged in the movement to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education to the workers, the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers will be further developed, and the First Five-Year Plan will definitely be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

    In our industrial and mining enterprises and transportation departments, there are many talented individuals who are capable of propaganda and mobilization work. Many Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, model workers, production experts, and cadres above the group leader level in trade unions and administration in enterprises can do propaganda and mobilization work. As long as the Party organizations of enterprises are good at using and giving play to the strength of these people, provide them with the necessary education and training, and form them into a large army of propaganda and mobilization, they can undertake the propaganda work for striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. Starting from New Year's Day this year, the Party Committee of the Harbin Tool Factory went deep into the masses and discovered a large number of propaganda talents, totaling more than 500 people. The Party Committee organized and trained them, imparted propaganda content, explained propaganda methods, and after analyzing and summarizing various conservative ideas among the masses, asked them to conduct propaganda and explanation to the masses in light of the masses' thinking. Subsequently, these propagandists became active among the broad masses of workers, reading the New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily to the workers sentence by sentence and paragraph by paragraph, listening to the feedback from the masses, explaining the Party's policies, and playing a leading role in the discussions. For example, Wen Daowei, a propagandist in the Second Workshop of the factory, actively helped the workers in his group find tricks, tap potential, and put forward rationalization proposals when the workers were discussing and formulating advanced plans. Under the leadership and influence of Wen Daowei, the group he was in not only broke through the targets initially proposed by the factory, but also put forward three basic measures to improve work. With such a large number of propaganda forces, the broad masses of workers can hear the Party's call at any time and anywhere and move in the direction pointed out by the Party.

    Various localities have also created many large-scale propaganda methods and forms:

    Radio conferences are a good way to mobilize thousands of workers to get involved in activities to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. The advantage of radio conferences is that they have a wide mass character and can enable leading cadres to meet directly with the masses. On January 13 this year, Harbin held a city-wide radio mobilization conference, calling on all workers in the city to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. The conference had a central venue and 493 branch venues, with a total of more than 169,000 people attending the conference and listening to the live broadcast of the conference. At the meeting, the workers listened to Chairman Mao's preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," the mobilization report on completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it by Ren Zhongyi, Second Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the speeches of many factory directors, model workers, and advanced producers. The speakers all said that in order to speed up the socialist construction of the motherland and better support agricultural cooperation and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, they must give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, overcome all difficulties, and strive to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. According to the specific situation of their units, groups and individuals, they put forward various indicators and specific measures to ensure the completion of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfillment it. During the conference, the central venue received hundreds of phone calls and hundreds of letters from all directions, expressing the enthusiasm and firm will of thousands of workers to build socialism. After the meeting, the workers of each factory actively took action to respond to the call of the Party and the state with practical actions.

    Celebration meetings are also an effective way to encourage and promote general and backward workers to learn from advanced figures. A factory, a workshop, a group, one or several people who have completed the Five-Year Plan or the quarterly plan or the monthly plan ahead of schedule can hold such a celebration meeting to commend them. The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory created a model for such propaganda. The factory recently held a celebration meeting for veteran milling worker Su Guangming and fitter Zhang Zhigui, who completed the Five-Year Plan 23 months ahead of schedule. More than 1,000 representatives of workers from the entire factory attended. Responsible comrades from the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Industrial Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee, and relevant agencies such as the provincial and municipal trade unions also attended the meeting and congratulated them. Through such meetings, not only is it a great encouragement to Su Guangming and Zhang Zhigui, but it is also a good education for all the workers in the factory. Many workers and advanced producers have expressed that they want to learn from Su Guangming and Zhang Zhigui.

    The Party organizations of factories and mines should promptly and conscientiously summarize the propaganda experience in this area and vigorously promote it in order to strengthen the propaganda work on completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it.

    为提早完成五年计划而加紧宣传
    王占业
    目前，各个工矿企业和交通运输部门的职工，正在为争取提前和超额完成五年计划而展开社会主义竞赛。在社会主义竞赛运动中，党组织的宣传鼓动工作如果能够紧紧地跟上去，善于利用运动中已经出现的新人新事，广泛深入地向职工群众进行宣传教育，职工群众的积极性和创造性就会得到进一步的发扬，第一个五年计划就一定能够提前和超额完成。
    在我们的工矿企业和交通运输部门中，能够胜任宣传鼓动工作的人材是很多的。企业中有许多党员、团员、劳动模范、生产能手以及工会和行政的小组长以上的干部都会做宣传鼓动工作。只要企业的党组织善于使用和发挥这些人的力量，对他们进行必要的教育和训练，把他们组成一支宣传鼓动的大军，就能担负起争取提前和超额完成五年计划的宣传工作。从今年元旦开始，哈尔滨工具厂的党委深入群众，发现了大批宣传人材，共有500多人。党委对他们进行了组织和训练，传授了宣传内容，交代了宣传方法，并且把群众中的各种保守思想加以分析归纳以后，要他们针对群众的思想向群众进行宣传解释。随后这些宣传人员活跃在广大职工中间，给职工逐句逐段地读人民日报的元旦社论，听取群众的反映，解释党的政策，并且在讨论中发挥了带头作用。如该厂二车间的宣传员文道维，在职工讨论制定先进计划的时候，积极地帮助本组的工人找窍门，挖潜力，提合理化建议。在文道维的带动和影响下，他所在的小组不但突破了厂部初步提出的指标，而且提出了三项改进工作的基本措施。有了这样一大批宣传力量，就可以使广大职工随时随地听到党的号召，向着党指出的方向前进。
    各地还创造了不少大规模的宣传方法方式：
    广播大会是动员成千上万的职工群众卷入提前并超额完成五年计划活动的一种很好的宣传方式。广播大会的优点是具有广泛的群众性，而且能够使领导干部直接同群众见面。哈尔滨市在今年1月13日举行了全市性的广播动员大会，号召全市职工争取提前和超额完成五年计划。大会设有一个中心会场和493个分会场，参加大会和收听大会实况广播的共有169，000多人。会上，职工们听取了毛主席的“中国农村的社会主义高潮”的序言，中共哈尔滨市委第二书记任仲夷关于提前和超额完成五年计划的动员报告，以及许多工厂厂长、劳动模范和先进生产者的发言。发言的人都表示：为了加快祖国的社会主义建设速度，更好地支援农业合作化和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，一定要发挥积极性和创造性，克服一切困难，争取提前和超额完成五年计划。他们根据本单位、本小组和个人的具体情况，提出了保证提前和超额完成五年计划的各种指标和具体措施。在大会进行的时候，中心会场接到了从四面八方打来的几百次电话和送来的成百封信，它们表达了成千上万职工建设社会主义的热情和坚强意志。会后，各厂的职工就积极地行动起来，要以实际行动来回答党和国家的号召。
    庆祝大会，也是鼓舞和推动一般的和落后的职工向先进人物看齐的一种有效的宣传方式。一个工厂、一个车间、一个小组、一个或几个人提前完成了五年计划或季度计划、月计划，都可以举行这样的庆祝大会予以表扬。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂创造了这样宣传的范例。该厂最近召开了庆祝老铣工苏广铭、钳工张执贵提前23个月完成五年计划的大会。全厂职工代表有一千多人参加。中共黑龙江省委和哈尔滨市委工业部以及省、市工会等有关机关的负责同志也都出席了这个大会，向他们祝贺。通过这样的会议，不仅对苏广铭和张执贵两人是一个很大的鼓舞，而且对全厂职工也是一次很好的教育，许多工人和先进生产者都表示要向苏广铭和张执贵学习。
    厂矿企业党组织应当及时地认真地总结这方面的宣传经验，大力推广，以加强关于提前和超额完成五年计划的宣传工作。
