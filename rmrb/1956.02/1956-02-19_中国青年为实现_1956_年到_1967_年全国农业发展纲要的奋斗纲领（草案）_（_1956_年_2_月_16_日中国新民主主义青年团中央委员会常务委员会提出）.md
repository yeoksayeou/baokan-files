The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on January 23, 1956, proposed to the people of the whole country the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967. This is a great program for building our country's countryside into a new socialist countryside. By realizing this program, our 500 million peasants will enter a new era of a happy and prosperous life. Article 38 of the draft program stipulates: "Promote the enthusiasm of rural youth for labor and for learning culture and science and technology. Rural youth should become active members and shock forces in rural production and scientific and cultural undertakings." This is the Party's high trust in the youth and also a great call to the youth. Our country's youth have already shown good performance in the struggle to reform the land system, promote agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, and develop agricultural production, and have won praise from the broad masses of the people. In order to enable the youth of the whole country to contribute their greatest strength in this great struggle to realize the agricultural development program, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League convened responsible comrades of the League committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and responsible comrades of some prefectural-level cities and prefectural committees from January 24 to 31, 1956, for discussion, and formulated this draft program of struggle. This draft is now being published. The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League requires League committees at all levels to lead the broad masses of League members and youth to take immediate action and join the battle. At the same time, it requires League committees at all levels to organize the broad masses of youth to discuss this draft program, collect opinions, and submit them to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the League, which is scheduled to be held after April 1, 1956, for discussion and adoption, and to be regarded as a part of the Chinese youth's program of struggle for the early realization of socialism.

	One, all the youth of the country should have a high degree of enthusiasm for loving the cooperatives. Rural youth should use their exemplary actions to influence and persuade the masses around them to join cooperatives, and promote the transition of elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives in stages and batches according to the conditions stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft); youth who have already joined cooperatives should abide by the cooperative's charter, work diligently in production, study hard, care about collective interests, and dare to fight against bad people and bad deeds, striving to be excellent cooperative members, so that our country's agricultural cooperation cause can develop prosperously.

	Two, young men and women should be people who study hard and actively accept new things. Rural youth should regularly familiarize themselves with the Party and the state's agricultural policies, and strive to become active members in publicizing and implementing the Party and the state's agricultural policies. In the competition for high and abundant agricultural yields, rural League organizations should actively promote all yield-increasing measures that can be taken locally, such as implementing continuous cropping, intercropping, and popularizing improved varieties. League organizations should organize youth to visit and learn from the high-yield experiences of veteran farmers and agricultural labor models. League organizations and youth should strive to learn all scientific and technological knowledge related to agricultural production. In order to improve rural youth's agricultural scientific knowledge and scientific skills, youth should actively participate in rural amateur agricultural technical schools. Young men and women in our country's countryside should inherit and absorb all agricultural high-yield experiences in the history of the motherland and all the most advanced agricultural technologies in the world.

	Three, rural youth should become a heroic shock force for rapidly increasing agricultural production. All young men and women should love labor, develop the habit of diligent labor, and strive to learn various skills of agricultural production. Every able-bodied young man and woman should do their best to work 250 or 120 workdays per year, expand the scope of operation, open up more avenues of production, increase production, and increase income. In places where there are new agricultural implements and other machinery, youth should quickly learn to use these implements and machinery. According to production needs, especially when there are urgent or difficult production tasks, rural youth should also form various shock teams to complete these tasks as quickly and well as possible with their advanced behavior; they can also establish youth production teams or youth production groups according to the decision of the cooperative management committee. Youth production teams (groups) should carry out production activities under the unified leadership and unified planning of the cooperative. League organizations should make this production organization a production unit of advanced collectives that improves labor efficiency, breaks through production quotas, promotes advanced technology, and does a good job in management and operation.

	Four, rural League members and young men and women should cherish livestock. In order to breed livestock and maintain livestock, League organizations should organize young people and children to widely carry out activities to collect feed and silage feed. In places where there is a shortage of breeders, League organizations should select outstanding youth or organize youth breeding groups to take on breeding work. Youth who are engaged in breeding work should strive to learn advanced breeding experience and breeding knowledge, and feed the livestock so that they are fat, strong, numerous, and good. In places where there is a shortage of veterinarians, League organizations should select outstanding youth to study veterinary work. Youth who are engaged in veterinary work should be proficient in their business and become excellent veterinary staff.

	Five, rural youth should use all methods to open up fertilizer sources and accumulate fertilizer. In places where there are no toilets and livestock sheds, they should actively advocate and take the lead in building toilets and livestock sheds, and use as much human and animal manure as possible as fertilizer. In places where firewood and grass are burned, they should widely advocate storing firewood ash and grass ash alone. In places where there are ponds and ditches, they should mobilize youth to dig pond mud and ditch mud in appropriate seasons. All places should also launch a green manure composting movement in the summer and autumn seasons and strive to accumulate fertilizer.

	Six, rural youth must stand at the forefront of building water conservancy and maintaining soil and water. In all water-scarce places where water sources can be developed, youth should take the initiative to initiate canal construction, well digging, pond digging, and dam construction, and turn all possible arable land into paddy fields and irrigated land in a planned way. In areas with soil erosion, youth should actively participate in the construction of field projects, gully management, and grass planting to protect slopes. In low-lying and waterlogged areas, youth should actively participate in the construction of ditch and furrow ridge fields. Youth who work in large-scale water conservancy projects should love their work, give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and complete their tasks excellently, so that these projects are done more, better, faster, and more economically.

	Seven, rural youth should become experts in eliminating crop pests and diseases. In order to ensure that locusts, armyworms, rice borers, corn borers, cotton aphids, red spiders, bollworms, wheat smut, wheat nematode disease, and sweet potato black spot disease, the ten major pests and diseases, are basically eliminated within 7 or 12 years: (1) All young men and women should learn the necessary knowledge of preventing and controlling crop pests and diseases and the skills to eliminate pests and diseases; (2) Youth should actively break the superstitious ideas of some farmers who dare not catch pests by reasoning; (3) League organizations should organize youth plant protection intelligence groups and pest and disease elimination groups to lead young people and children to carry out pest and disease elimination activities in a timely manner.

	Eight, the youth and children of the whole country should be the most active and vigorous force in greening the motherland. In order to ensure that all possible barren mountains, barren land, and all cities and villages are greened within 12 years: (1) It is stipulated that April 1st and November 1st of each year are National Youth and Children Tree Planting Days. League organizations in both urban and rural areas should organize young people and children to carry out tree planting activities on these two days. (2) Widely promote the collective construction of youth forests, children's forests, and youth orchards by young people and children. (3) Develop the habit of young people and children loving and protecting trees and forests, and actively organize them to participate in forest protection work. (4) In places where there is a shortage of seedlings, grassroots League organizations should lead young people and children to establish nurseries. (5) League organizations and youth in provinces, prefectures, counties, districts, and townships rich in tree seeds and fruit tree seeds should donate tree seeds and fruit tree seeds to provinces, prefectures, counties, districts, and townships lacking tree seeds and fruit tree seeds. (6) In places with the habit of burning mountains, League organizations and youth should actively persuade the surrounding masses to change the habit of burning mountains.

	Nine, the youth and children of the whole country should make special efforts in the struggle to eliminate the four pests. In order to strive to eliminate sparrows, rats, flies, and mosquitoes as soon as possible within 5, 7, or 12 years, all urban and rural League organizations must, according to local conditions and under the leadership of the Party, formulate specific plans for eliminating the four pests, and mobilize and lead young people and children to widely carry out activities to eliminate the four pests in a step-by-step manner. Youth who work in grain warehouses should ensure that there are no rats or sparrows in the warehouses and protect the property of the state and cooperatives from loss. In rural areas and mountainous areas where wild animals are harmful, League organizations should also organize youth hunting teams to actively eliminate various harmful animals. While eliminating the four pests, young people and children should also develop the good habit of protecting beneficial birds and insects.

	Ten, youth should become the vanguard of the motherland in reclaiming wasteland. In order to increase the motherland's grain and promote the patriotic spirit of youth building the frontier, youth voluntary reclamation groups should be formed according to the state's plan to carry out long-distance reclamation. In all places with wasteland that does not damage soil and water conservation, League organizations should organize youth to carry out short-distance reclamation under the unified plan of the local government. Rural and urban youth should use small plots of vacant land to plant oil crops and economic forests such as sunflowers, castor beans, mulberry, oak, tea, fruit trees, and bamboo.

	Eleven, youth in rural and suburban areas of cities should contribute their strength to making the country's transportation accessible in all directions. Youth should actively take the lead in participating in road construction projects in various places. In places where conditions permit, youth can use voluntary labor to build youth roads. Youth should cherish the country's highways and local roads, and should take the initiative to repair them when roads and bridges are damaged and can be repaired with effort.

	Twelve, youth engaged in forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and salt industry should actively strive to realize cooperation. Youth who have already joined these cooperatives should promote the spirit of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, strive to learn advanced experience in their respective industries, and actively work for the prosperity and development of the motherland's forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and salt industry.

	Thirteen, all young men and women who participate in agricultural, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and salt industry cooperatives should care about the elderly, widowed, lonely, and disabled veterans who have lost their ability to work within the cooperative. When they encounter difficulties, they should take the initiative to help if they can, and actively reflect to the leadership of the cooperative if they cannot solve them. Youth should develop the good customs of respecting the old and cherishing the young.

	Fourteen, rural League organizations and youth should actively help the government educate and supervise landlords and rich peasants who have not yet changed their status to become cooperative members, so that they love the country, abide by the law, and work honestly. Youth from landlord and rich peasant families who have already become cooperative members should actively help their fathers and brothers who have not yet obtained cooperative member status to make progress.

	Fifteen, rural League organizations and youth should actively help the government educate and supervise counter-revolutionaries who are under the control of cooperatives for production, so that they can thoroughly repent and become new people in labor reform. League members and youth should always maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and wage a resolute struggle against counter-revolutionaries who carry out sabotage activities at any time and anywhere.

	Sixteen, young men and women in rural areas throughout the country should be determined to get rid of illiteracy within seven years and strive to become cultured and knowledgeable people. In order to ensure the victorious completion of the literacy campaign: (1) Grassroots League cadres and activists in rural areas should take the lead in learning and recognize more than 1,500 characters. (2) All villages and cooperatives must quickly organize literacy work teams, and youth who have escaped illiteracy should enthusiastically participate in literacy work and dedicate the knowledge they have learned to their surrounding partners. (3) All rural League organizations should actively assist village governments and cooperatives to popularize compulsory education in a planned way and strive to ensure that all school-age children aged eight to fourteen are enrolled in school as soon as possible. (4) Rural League organizations should actively create conditions to assist the government and cooperatives in running amateur primary schools and amateur middle schools, and widely organize self-study groups, so that youth who have escaped illiteracy can continue to improve their cultural level. (5) Rural League members and youth should take the lead in learning and promoting Mandarin Chinese, and strive to enable all young people and children to speak Mandarin Chinese within 12 years. All League cadres, young staff members of state organs, and young teachers and students should learn Mandarin Chinese early. (6) Youth and children's newspapers and publishing houses should improve their business and expand the distribution of books and periodicals. Youth who work in post offices and bookstores should love their work and continuously send reading materials suitable for rural youth to the hands of young people and children. League organizations should also recommend outstanding youth to serve as postmen to help the post office do a good job in distribution.

	Seventeen, rural youth should be active members in carrying out rural cultural and recreational activities. League organizations should create conditions and actively participate in the construction of clubs and libraries by means of voluntary labor. Rural League organizations should select outstanding youth to serve as radio operators and broadcasters, so that the broad masses of farmers can regularly understand the Party's policies and domestic and international events. League organizations should also plan to establish amateur theater troupes and singing teams to replace unhealthy pastimes with proper recreational activities and enliven rural cultural life.

	Eighteen, rural youth should become an active force in promoting rural health. Young men and women should develop good habits of brushing their teeth, washing their faces, taking baths, washing and drying clothes and bedding, being neat and tidy, and paying attention to hygiene. Young men and women should do a good job in the hygiene of their own families and beautify the environment around their residences. Rural League organizations should also organize young people and children to learn hygiene knowledge, take the lead in advocating public health, and hold several major cleanups every year. Actively participate in the work of preventing and controlling various diseases. In areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, young people and children should also actively participate in the work of eliminating Oncomelania snails and preventing and controlling schistosomiasis.

	Nineteen, youth should regard strengthening their physical fitness as an important task of loving themselves and loving the motherland. To this end, rural League organizations should actively assist the government and cooperatives in building sports venues, and strive to have sports fields in every township as soon as possible, and conduct various sports competitions in their spare time and during the slack season. In all seashores and places with rivers, lakes, and ponds, as long as there are no hazards such as sharks and schistosomiasis, young men and women should be widely encouraged to swim. Rural League organizations should also systematically promote the labor and defense system, organize young people and children to climb mountains, travel, and carry out national defense sports activities.

	Twenty, youth who work in state-owned farms, state-owned ranches, technology extension stations, tractor stations, hydrological stations, meteorological stations, and health centers, animal epidemic prevention stations, and breeding stations should love their work, be proficient in their business, and regularly understand the requirements and opinions of the masses to better serve the peasants.

	Twenty-one, youth who work in commercial departments, banks, and rural supply and marketing cooperatives and rural credit cooperatives should love their work, closely connect with the masses, strengthen their sense of revolutionary responsibility, and improve their management and operation capabilities, so as to supply peasants with means of production and daily necessities in a timely manner, and do a good job in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and credit savings work.

	Twenty-two, youth in factories, mines, enterprises, and transportation departments should actively respond to the Party's call, comprehensively launch socialist competitions, produce more and better industrial products, and accelerate the circulation of materials to meet the needs of peasants. At the same time, strengthen friendly ties with rural youth through visits, interactions, communications, and voluntary assistance.

	Twenty-three, youth should develop a noble patriotism and communist morality of diligence, thrift, and building the motherland. Young men and women in rural areas should oppose extravagance and waste, pay attention to saving grain, and actively carry out activities to reduce grain and cotton losses. Young men and women across the country must understand that as long as we inherit and carry forward the spirit of hard work of our revolutionary elders, we can build our motherland faster and better.

	Twenty-four, in the great march of youth across the country to realize the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, outstanding youth figures in all aspects will surely emerge continuously. League organizations at all levels should quickly establish a system for registering and rewarding them, report them level by level on a quarterly basis, and give them appropriate rewards in a timely manner. Their beneficial creations, advanced experiences, and excellent qualities should be disseminated and promoted to the broad masses of youth, so that more youth can learn from them. League organizations should also recommend those young and outstanding cadres and scientific and technical talents who have newly grown up in production and work to the Party and the government and promote them to appropriate leadership positions.

	Twenty-five, in order to ensure the victorious realization of this program of struggle, all young men and women League members should stand at the forefront of the youth masses, and League organizations at all levels should pay more attention to and strengthen the building of League organizations, so as to promptly absorb the young activists who are constantly emerging on various fronts into the League, earnestly strengthen the League's ideological education, and improve the League's organizational leadership, so that the Youth League becomes a strong core for uniting and organizing the youth of the country to victoriously realize this program of struggle.

    二十五、为着保证这个奋斗纲领的胜利实现，一切男女团员都应当站在青年群众的前列，各级团的组织都要更加重视和加强团的组织建设，做到及时地把各个战线上不断涌现出来的青年积极分子吸收到团里面来，认真地加强团的思想教育和健全团的组织领导，使青年团成为团结和组织全国青年胜利地实现这个奋斗纲领的坚强核心。
