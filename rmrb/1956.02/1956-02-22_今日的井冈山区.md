    Today's Jinggang Mountain Area
    Wang Jian, Ma Zhichao
    The heroic Jinggang Mountain has undergone profound changes since liberation.
    All of the more than 700 peasant households living here have joined semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives. More than 1,300 mu of land that had been abandoned before liberation has been completely reclaimed due to the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement. The peasants of Dajing Township, where Chairman Mao lived, reclaimed 150 mu of wasteland and barren land after liberation. The average yield per mu of land on the mountain has increased from just over 100 jin to about 250 jin.
    Forestry in the mountains has also greatly developed. The 29 forest farms that were burned down by the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation have all been restored. The mountains are covered with saplings of Chinese fir and oil-tea trees.
    Due to the development of production, the lives of the mountain peasants have also improved significantly. In the past, the mountain peasants lived in thatched cottages, but now, most of them live in new houses, and new houses are still being built. In 1955, the turnover of the Jinggang Mountain Area Supply and Marketing Cooperative increased from 12,000 yuan in 1952 to 70,000 yuan. Before liberation, most of the peasants in Jinggang Mountain were illiterate, and children could not find places to study. But now, thanks to the literacy movement and the establishment of primary schools, most of the peasants are literate, and all school-age children are in school. Currently, 17 of the 19 agricultural production cooperative accountants in the mountains are graduates of Jinggang Mountain Primary School. Student Ji Yinglian is now the first female accountant in the agricultural production cooperatives in Jinggang Mountain.
    After liberation, health clinics and midwifery stations were also established in Jinggang Mountain, and mass patriotic health campaigns were launched. Every township has new-method midwives. Diseases such as dysentery, leprosy, and malaria have basically disappeared, and the population has increased from more than 1,900 in 1949 to more than 2,500.
    Currently, the peasants in the Jinggang Mountain area have proposed a target of increasing agricultural production by more than 25% in 1956, and have actively carried out winter plowing to eliminate insects, accumulate fertilizer, and reclaim wasteland. According to the new plan, the Jinggang Mountain Area Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will establish advanced agricultural production cooperatives in the mountains this year. The future Jinggang Mountain area will surely be even more beautiful.

    今日的井冈山区
    王坚　马志超
    英雄的井冈山，解放以来已经发生了深刻的变化。
    在这里住着的700多户农民，已经全部加入了半社会主义的农业生产合作社。解放前被荒芜的1，300多亩土地，由于农业合作化运动的发展，农民们克服了各种困难，已经全部垦复了。毛主席当年住过的大井乡的97户农民，解放后就垦复了150亩荒田和荒地。原来山上土地的单位面积产量每亩平均才100多斤，现在已经提高到250斤左右。
    山上的林业也有了很大的发展。解放前被国民党反动派烧毁了的29块林场，现在全部恢复了。山上，到处都是杉树、油茶树的幼林。
    由于生产的发展，山上农民的生活也有了显著的改善。过去山上农民住的是茅草屋，现在，绝大部分农民都住上了新房子，新的住宅还在不断地修建。1955年井冈山区供销合作社的营业额已经由1952年的12，000元上升到7万元。解放以前，井冈山上的农民绝大部分是文盲，儿童们找不到读书处所。但是现在，由于开展了识字运动，开办了小学，大部分农民都识字了，所有适龄的儿童也都上了学。现在山上19个农业生产合作社的会计就有17个是井冈山小学毕业的学生，学生季英莲现在是井冈山上农业生产合作社中第一个女会计。
    解放后，井冈山上还设立了卫生所、接生站，开展了群众性的爱国卫生运动。乡乡都有了新法接生员。痢疾、麻疯、疟疾等病基本绝迹，人口由1949年的1，900多人增加到2，500多人。
    目前，井冈山区的农民已经提出了争取在1956年增加农业生产25％以上的指标，并且积极进行了冬耕灭虫、积肥和开荒等工作。中共井冈山区委会根据新的规划，今年要在山上办高级农业生产合作社。未来的井冈山区，一定会更加美丽。
