Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th: Farmers in Shanxi Province have started spring plowing activities ahead of schedule. Agricultural producers' cooperatives in more than 50 counties in southern Shanxi, such as Ruicheng and Jieyu, Yanggao in Yanbei, and Jincheng and Yangcheng in the Taihang Mountains, have generally started harrowing and compacting the soil 15 days earlier than in previous years to preserve moisture, due to the recent drought. In these areas, hundreds of thousands of draught animals are being used every day. In the ten or so days since the thaw, more than 6.8 million mu of arable land, prepared for sowing cotton and corn, has been harrowed once or twice.

This year, Shanxi Province's large-scale spring plowing activities are being carried out after more than 94% of the province's farmers have joined fully socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives. These cooperatives have already formulated spring plowing production plans, divided cultivation areas, and rationally adjusted labor organizations. They have also launched competitions between teams and groups, increasing labor utilization and attendance rates by 30% to 50% compared to the past, ensuring that spring plowing is carried out ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 27th: In Qinghai Province, spring wheat has been successively sown from mid-February in the Xunhua Salar Autonomous County along the Yellow River and in the Mutual Aid Tu Autonomous County and Minhe County in the lower reaches of the Huangshui River.

    山西农民提前春耕
    青海部分地区播种小麦
    据新华社太原27日电　山西省农民提前开展春耕活动。晋南地区的芮城、解虞，雁北的阳高，太行山区的晋城、阳城等50多个县的农业生产合作社，根据近来呈现旱象的情况，普遍比往年提前15天开始耙地、压地保墒。这些地区近几天每天有几十万头耕畜出动，仅在解冻后的十多天里，就把准备播种棉花、玉米的680多万亩耕地普遍耙过一、二次。
    今年，山西省大规模的春耕活动是在全省94％以上的农户加入了全社会主义的农业生产合作社以后开展的。这些社已经制定了春耕生产计划，划分了耕作区，合理调整了劳动组织，还展开了队和队、组和组之间的竞赛，使劳动力利用率和出勤率比过去提高了30％到50％，保证春耕提前进行。
    据新华社西宁27日电　青海省黄河沿岸的循化撒拉族自治县和湟水下游的互助土族自治县、民和县等地，从2月中旬起陆续播种春小麦。
