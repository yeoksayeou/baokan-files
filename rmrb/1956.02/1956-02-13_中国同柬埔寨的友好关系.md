    The friendly and peaceful relationship between China and Cambodia has a long history.

    As early as 1,700 years ago, there were interactions between China and Cambodia. In the mid-3rd century AD, Chinese footprints had already reached Cambodian soil. This was when Sun Quan of the Three Kingdoms period dispatched Zhu Ying and Kang Tai, along with their boatmen and sailors, overseas. At that time, China referred to a kingdom established in Cambodia as Funan. After Zhu Ying and Kang Tai returned to China, they recorded what they saw and heard in Funan. The dugout canoes made by the people of Funan at that time left a deep impression on them and were described in detail in their writings. They described Funan's wooden boats as resembling fish in their head and tail shapes, over 90 feet long and 6 feet wide, capable of carrying 40 to 50 or even 100 people, each equipped with long oars, short oars, and bamboo poles. They used long oars when standing to row, short oars when sitting, and poles for shallow water, rowing together "in perfect unison." The life of Cambodian fishermen on the water and the simple and lightweight shape of their wooden boats over 1,700 years ago were preserved to this day in the descriptions of Chinese travelers, which is a good commemoration of the friendly relationship between the peoples of China and Cambodia.

    Ancient Cambodians were not only good at making dugout canoes, but also at building large seagoing ships. Relying on these seagoing ships, the King of Funan once sent an orchestra to China in 243 AD, and presented local products as gifts to Sun Quan. This was the beginning of Cambodian visits to China. Later, Funan people continuously traded with China—mainly in Guangzhou. The famous "Funan large ships" transported many products from Funan and other countries in the South China Sea. Funan's plants, such as bamboo and sugarcane, were famous in Chinese history. At the end of the 3rd century, the sugarcane sent by Funan was as long as ten feet, but had only three sections. Wu Jun, a Chinese writer in the 6th century, once described the crispness and tenderness of "Funan sugarcane" in his works, saying that the sun would melt it and a gentle breeze would break it. The Southern Dynasties and the Tang Dynasty both had contact with Funan. Several Funan monks came to China in the late 5th and early 6th centuries, one of whom, Sanghavarman, understood several languages and translated more than 40 volumes of Buddhist scriptures, and was highly respected by people at that time. The Sui Dynasty once received a Funan orchestra that played Funan music using Indian instruments.

    Later, another kingdom within Cambodia, Zhenla, unified Cambodia, and Zhenla became the country's name. The Zhenla of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties was Cambodia. During these 1,000 years, trade relations between China and Zhenla never ceased. The goods that Zhenla supplied to China mainly included ivory, spices, beeswax, raw silk, etc. China also supplied Zhenla with various commodities. At the end of the 13th century, Zhou Daguan from Wenzhou visited Zhenla, going in 1295 and returning in 1297. He wrote a book called "A Record of Cambodia: The Land and Its People," which recorded some of his observations there. The books of Zhu Ying, Kang Tai, and Zhou Daguan are very useful materials for studying ancient Cambodian history. According to Zhou Daguan's records, the people of Zhenla at that time were interested in many things made in China. For example, tinware from Zhenzhou, lacquerware from Wenzhou, porcelain from Quanzhou, and mats from Mingzhou, many handicraft products with local characteristics in southern China were sold to Zhenla. In addition, Chinese paper, linen, umbrellas, iron pots, copper plates, wooden combs, needles, and other daily necessities were also commonly used by the people of Zhenla. It can be seen that the economic ties between Zhenla and China were very close at that time. After the 16th century, Zhenla changed its name to Cambodia. Zhang Xie's "Dongxi Yang Kao" written in the early 17th century recorded that the market trade between Chinese merchants and Cambodians in Cambodia was fair and reasonable, and no disputes ever occurred. This kind of trade relationship has not changed after so many centuries.

    Since the end of the 19th century, French colonialists have hindered the development of friendly relations between China and Cambodia. However, the friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Cambodia have not been interrupted, as can be seen from the situation of overseas Chinese in Cambodia. There are now about 300,000 overseas Chinese in Cambodia. Most of them came across the sea from various provinces in southern China. Most are engaged in agriculture, planting vegetables and pepper. The overseas Chinese in Cambodia have always lived in peace with the Cambodian people, and their relationship is harmonious. For 70 years, the French colonialists have implemented various policies of oppression and division against the overseas Chinese, destroying the friendly relations between the overseas Chinese and the Cambodian people, but they have not achieved their goals.

    After World War II, due to the great victory of the national independence movements of the colonial and semi-colonial peoples, especially the complete liberation of the Chinese people, the face of Asia has undergone fundamental changes. The French colonialists were forced to recognize the independence of Cambodia. In this way, it is possible for the peoples of China and Cambodia to develop and deepen our 1,700-year-old friendship. The peoples of China and Cambodia have united in the cause of opposing colonialism and defending peace in Asia.

    The 1954 Geneva Accords brought peace to Cambodia, ensuring its independence, unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. At the same time, the Cambodian government declared that it would not participate in military blocs and would not allow foreign countries to establish military bases in Cambodia, which reflects the Cambodian people's determination to defend peace. Last March, the Cambodian government delegation led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a joint communiqué after their talks, endorsing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. At the Asian-African Conference, the Cambodian delegation reaffirmed that Cambodia would adhere to neutrality and would not allow Cambodia to be used as a base for aggression. The Cambodian government, led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, is pursuing a policy of peace-loving and neutral adherence, which helps to maintain peace in Indochina and helps the Cambodian people develop peaceful and friendly relations with the peoples of Asian countries.

    Now, Prince Norodom Sihanouk's visit to China is a new page in the history of friendly relations between China and Cambodia. We firmly believe that on the common basis of defending peace, the 1,700-year friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia will be newly developed, and economic and cultural exchanges will be more frequent than in the past. The two peoples will make more contributions to the world peace movement. Let us work hard to further strengthen the friendly relations between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples!

    中国同柬埔寨的友好关系
    周一良
    中国和柬埔寨的和平友好关系是有着长远历史的。
    早在1，700多年以前，中柬两国已经有了来往。公元3世纪中期，中国人的足迹便已到达柬埔寨的土地。这就是三国时代的孙权派遣到海外去的朱应、康泰两人和他们所带领的船夫水手们。那时中国称呼在柬埔寨所建立的一个国家为扶南。朱应、康泰回国以后，把他们在扶南所见所闻记录下来。扶南人民当时所制造的独木船给了他们很深的印象，在书里有详细的记载。他们描写扶南木船说头尾都和鱼相似，长90多尺，宽6尺，能容四、五十人到100人，每人备有长桨、短桨和竹篙各一。站着划船便用长桨，坐时用短桨，水浅就用篙撑，划起来“应声如一”。1，700多年前柬埔寨水上渔民的生活和轻便简捷的木船形状，在中国旅行家的描写里保存到今天，这正是中柬两国人民友好关系很好的纪念。
    古代柬埔寨人不但善于造独木船，而且善于造航海的大船。依靠这种海船，扶南国王在公元243年曾经派遣乐队到中国，并且赠送土产礼品给孙权，这是柬埔寨人到中国的开始。以后扶南人不断到中国——主要是广州——进行贸易。有名的“扶南大舶”运来不少扶南以及南海各国的产品，扶南的植物如竹子和甘蔗都是在中国历史上有名的。3世纪末扶南送来的甘蔗长达一丈，却只有三节。6世纪时的中国文学家吴均的作品里曾经描写“扶南甘蔗”的脆嫩，说太阳会把它晒化，微风会把它吹断。南朝和唐朝都同扶南有来往。5世纪末六世纪初有几个扶南僧人到中国来，其中有一个僧伽婆罗懂得几国语文，曾翻译佛经40多卷，很受当时人的尊重。隋朝曾经得到扶南乐队，用印度乐器演奏扶南音乐。
    后来柬埔寨境内的另一国家真腊统一了柬埔寨，即以真腊为国名。唐、宋、元、明时代的真腊就是柬埔寨。这1，000年当中，中国和真腊之间的贸易关系没有断过。真腊供给中国的商品，主要是象牙、香料、黄蜡、生丝等。中国也有各种各样的商品供给真腊。13世纪末叶，温州人周达观曾到过真腊，1295年去，1297年才回来。他写了一部真腊风土记，记载他在那里观察到的一些情况。朱应、康泰和周达观的书，对于研究柬埔寨古代历史，都是很有用的材料。据周达观的记载，当时真腊人对于中国制造的很多东西都感觉兴趣。例如真州的锡器，温州的漆器，泉州的磁器，明州的席子等等，中国南方许多具有地方特点的手工业出品，都运销到真腊去。此外中国的纸张、麻布、雨伞、铁锅、铜盘、木梳、针等等日常生活用品，也都是真腊人民所习用的。可见当时真腊和中国经济联系的密切。16世纪以后真腊改名柬埔寨。17世纪初张燮所作“东西洋考”，记载在柬埔寨经商的中国人和柬埔寨人之间的市道交易公平合理地进行，从没发生过纠纷。这种贸易上的联系经历了多少世纪都没有改变。
    19世纪末叶以来，法国殖民主义者阻碍了中国和柬埔寨友好关系的发展。但是，中柬两国人民的友好来往并未中断，我们从柬埔寨华侨的情况可以看得出来。柬埔寨的华侨现在约有30万人。他们大都泛海来自中国南部各省。大部分从事于农业，栽种蔬菜和胡椒。在柬埔寨的华侨从来就同柬埔寨人民和平相处，他们的关系是融洽的。70年来，法国殖民者对华侨实行种种压迫和分化政策，破坏华侨和柬埔寨人民的友好关系，但是他们并没有达到目的。
    第二次世界大战以后，由于殖民地半殖民地人民民族独立运动的巨大胜利，特别是中国人民的彻底解放，亚洲的面貌起了根本的变化。法国殖民者不得不被迫承认柬埔寨的独立。这样，中柬两国人民就有可能发展并且加深我们1，700年来的友谊关系。中国和柬埔寨的人民在反对殖民主义、保卫亚洲和平的事业上，已经团结在一起了。
    1954年日内瓦协议给柬埔寨带来了和平，使它的独立、统一、主权和领土完整得到了保障。同时，柬埔寨政府声明，保证不参加军事集团，不允许外国在柬埔寨建立军事基地，这反映出柬埔寨人民保卫和平的决心。去年3月以西哈努克亲王为首的柬埔寨政府代表团和印度尼赫鲁总理会谈后发表联合公报，赞成和平共处的五项原则。在亚非会议上，柬埔寨代表团重申保证柬埔寨坚守中立，并且不使柬埔寨被用为进行侵略的基地。以西哈努克亲王为首的柬埔寨政府推行爱好和平、遵守中立的政策，有助于维护印度支那的和平，并有助于柬埔寨人民同亚洲各国人民发展和平友好关系。
    现在，西哈努克亲王来中国访问，是中国和柬埔寨友好关系史上新的一页。我们深信，在保卫和平的共同基础上，中柬两国人民1，700年以来的友谊关系将得到新的发展，经济、文化上的交流将比过去更加频繁。两国人民在全世界和平运动中，将作出更多的贡献。让我们为进一步加强中柬人民友好关系而努力！
