    Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries Construction
    Huge Soviet Steel Industry Production Capacity
    In 1955, the Soviet Union produced 45 million tons of steel, almost equal to the total steel production of three important capitalist countries: Britain, West Germany, and Italy. According to the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's steel production will reach 68.3 million tons in 1960, and pig iron production will reach 53 million tons. This means that by that time, the Soviet Union will be able to produce more than two tons of steel and more than one and a half tons of pig iron every second.
    The Soviet Union is the country with the richest iron ore deposits in the world. In order to meet the needs of the new Five-Year Plan, the exploration and exploitation of iron ore will be greatly expanded.
    During the new Five-Year Plan, the production of high-quality steel and steel products that meet high technical requirements will increase particularly rapidly. At present, the Soviet Union is producing electric furnaces with a capacity of 180 tons, which can produce 650 to 700 tons of steel per day, ten times the daily output of existing electric furnaces.
    During the new Five-Year Plan, many advanced methods will also be promoted in the Soviet steel industry. By 1960, all blast furnace ferroalloys will be produced using oxygen-enriched blast furnace methods, and approximately 40% of steel will be produced using oxygen steelmaking methods.
    Democratic Germany Successfully Completes First Five-Year Plan
    The State Central Bureau of Statistics of the German Democratic Republic published a report on January 4 stating that the first Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) of the German Democratic Republic has been successfully completed. The report pointed out that the total industrial output of the German Democratic Republic has more than doubled compared to 1936. The creation of the Republic's steel industry, the increase in power generation capacity, the development of the lignite industry, and the construction and reconstruction of 25 heavy machinery manufacturing enterprises have alleviated the industrial imbalances caused by the past capitalist development of industry, especially by the division of Germany.
    The report stated that the socialist factories and enterprises completed the production tasks assigned to them by the Five-Year Plan, and their percentage of the total industrial output increased from 77% in 1950 to 85% in 1955.
    The report stated that during the Five-Year Plan period, the total output of agriculture increased by 44%, and the socialist part of agriculture increased from 7% in 1950 to 29% in 1955.
    The report pointed out that during the Five-Year Plan period, the labor productivity of industrial workers increased by 54%, and the average wage of workers increased by 48%. National income increased by 62%. The volume of foreign trade increased by 180%.
    Vietnam Cultivates Technical Cadres and Workers
    Along with the upsurge of economic recovery, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is seeing more and more technical cadres and skilled workers with specialized knowledge.
    In the cause of restoring railway transportation, new engineers and technicians have emerged in Vietnam. They can independently design lines, bridges, ferries, and other relatively complex projects.
    Vietnam's second batch of tractor drivers has graduated, including Vietnam's first female tractor driver, Gao Shi Gai. New types of geological exploration personnel have surveyed the first batch of data for further development of Vietnam's rich mineral deposits. Vietnam has also cultivated a group of new hydrological workers, and 9 hydrological stations have been established on Vietnam's Red River and other rivers.
    Bulgaria Implements Sixth Price Reduction
    The Council of Ministers of Bulgaria and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party adopted a resolution deciding to implement the sixth national unified retail price reduction for consumer goods nationwide from February 6. The resolution listed various reduced-price foods and daily necessities, with price reductions ranging from 5% to 46%. Among them, vegetable oil and lard were reduced by 15% to 20%, rice, soybeans, and potatoes were reduced by 10% to 35%, bread and pasta products were reduced by 7% to 14%, and flour was reduced by 8% to 10%. Cotton and woolen fabrics were reduced by 10% to 25%. With the reduction in the prices of food commodities, the prices of food in canteens and restaurants will also be reduced.
    Albania 1955 Production Communique
    The Bureau of Statistics of the State Planning Commission of the People's Republic of Albania published a communique on the implementation of the 1955 national economic development plan.
    The communique stated that Albania's industrial production plan for 1955 was completed by 101.4%, and the total industrial output increased by 14.9% compared to 1954.
    In agriculture, the spring sowing and autumn sowing plans were basically completed. In 1955, the number of machine tractor stations increased by 61.5% compared to 1954, and the number of tractors increased by 58.5%.
    The number of agricultural production cooperatives reached 318 in 1955, an increase of 168 in one year.
    In 1955, the working people of Albania obtained housing with a total construction area of approximately 117,000 square meters. They obtained 8.3% more goods from the retail trade network than in 1954.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    巨大的苏联钢铁工业生产能力
    苏联1955年生产了4，500万吨钢，几乎等于英国、西德、意大利3个重要资本主义国家钢产量的总和。根据第六个五年计划，1960年苏联的钢产量将达到6，830万吨，铣铁产量将达到5，300万吨。这就是说，到那个时候苏联每隔一秒钟就能生产两吨多钢，一吨半以上的铣铁。
    苏联是世界上铁矿藏最丰富的国家。为了适应新五年计划的需要，铁矿的勘察和开采工作还将大大扩大。
    在新五年计划中，符合高度技术要求的优质钢和钢材的产量将增加得特别快。现在，苏联正在生产容量达180吨的电炉，这种电炉每天能生产650到700吨钢，十倍于现有各电炉每天的产量。
    在新五年计划期间，苏联钢铁工业中还要推广许多先进方法。到1960年，全部高炉铁合金都要采用富氧鼓风法生产，40％左右的钢将使用氧气炼钢法。
    民主德国胜利完成第一个五年计划
    德意志民主共和国国家中央统计局在元月4日发表报告说：德意志民主共和国第一个五年计划（1951年—1955年）已经胜利完成。报告指出，德意志民主共和国的工业总生产量已经比1936年增加了一倍以上。共和国钢铁工业的创建、发电容量的增加、褐煤工业的发展、25个重型机器制造企业的新建和重建等措施已经减轻了由于过去工业的资本主义发展特别是由于德国的分裂所造成的工业的不均衡现象。
    报告说，社会主义的工厂企业完成了五年计划给它们规定的生产任务，它们在工业总产量中所占的百分比已经从1950年的77％增加到1955年的85％。
    报告说，在五年计划期间，农业的总产量增加了44％，农业的社会主义部分从1950年的7％增加到1955年的29％。
    报告指出，在五年计划期间，产业工人的劳动生产率提高了54％，工人的平均工资增加了48％。国民收入增加了62％。对外贸易额增加了180％。
    越南培养出技术干部和工人
    伴随着经济恢复事业的高涨，越南民主共和国出现了愈来愈多的具有专门知识的技术干部和技术工人。
    在恢复铁路交通的事业中，越南出现了新的工程师和技术人员。他们可以自行设计线路、桥梁、渡口和其他比较复杂的工程。
    越南的第二批拖拉机手已经毕业，他们当中有着越南的第一个女拖拉机手高氏盖。新型的地质勘查人员已经为进一步开发越南的丰富矿藏而勘测了第一批的资料。越南也培养出一批新的水文工作者，已经有9个水文站在越南的红河和其他河流上建立起来。
    保加利亚实行第六次减低物价
    保加利亚部长会议和保加利亚共产党中央委员会通过了一项决议，决定从2月6日起在全国实行第六次减低消费品国家统一零售价格。决议开列了各种减价的食品和日用品，减价的幅度是5％到46％。其中，植物油和猪油减价15％到20％，大米、黄豆、马铃薯减价10％到35％，面包和面食品减价7％到14％，面粉减价8％到10％。棉织品和毛织品减价10％到25％。随着粮食商品价格的减低，食堂、饭馆的食品价格也要减低。
    阿尔巴尼亚1955年生产公报
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国家计划委员会统计局发表了1955年国民经济发展计划执行情况的公报。
    公报说，1955年阿尔巴尼亚的工业生产计划完成了101.4％，工业总产量比1954年增加了14.9％。
    在农业方面，春播和秋播计划基本上完成了。1955年，机器拖拉机站的数目比1954年增加了61.5％，拖拉机增加了58.5％。
    农业生产合作社的数目在1955年达到了318个，1年中增加了168个。
    1955年，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民获得了总建筑面积约为117，000平方公尺的住宅。他们从零售贸易网得到的商品比1954年多8.3％。
