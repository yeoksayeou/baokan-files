Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 4th — Under the influence of the spirit of Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui, who broke with convention and boldly innovated, workers in Fushun City's mines and factories are also finding ways to improve their production. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and workers from seven units, including the Laohutai Coal Mine, Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1, and Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant, held meetings to study how to learn from Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui's spirit of innovation in production.

	Ding Yishan, head of the coal mining area of ​​Laohutai Mine, created a continuous coal seam support, reforming the method of supporting sheds individually in mines that had been used for more than 40 years. In the past, the supports used in Fushun coal mines supported the coal seam individually. There was a gap of more than 1 meter between the coal wall and the support, so not only was the top force of the support small, but also accidents often occurred when coal miners mined under the empty top coal seam. The continuous support created by Ding Yishan connects individual supports into a whole, and the support is close to the coal wall, so that coal miners can safely mine under the coal seam shed. If this method is adopted in the entire mine, it can save more than 5,000 cubic meters of pit wood and save more than 12,000 man-days per year. Workers in another coal mining area of ​​this mine also broke the past regulations of mining coal layer by layer. The workers now mine the coal seams separately and simultaneously, changing the past situation where more than 20 people were crowded in a mining site when mining one layer, which made it difficult to move around, improving coal mining efficiency by 70%.

	Wang Jixin, an assistant engineer at Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1, used to have many concerns and was unwilling to put forward suggestions for improving production; now he has been inspired by the deeds of Zhou Guangrui, and recently researched a method to improve the heat exchanger in the sulfuric acid workshop. After this method is implemented, it can increase the production of sulfuric acid.

	Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 4th — The coal mining operation method created by Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui, after technical appraisal by engineers of the Fushun Mining Bureau, has been included as part of the coal mining regulations. The engineers believe that the coal mining operation method they created is a scientific, rational, and advanced method, and is a comprehensive reform from technical operation to labor organization.

    抚顺市职工又打破三项生产常规
    庞观祥和周广瑞创造的采煤法已被列入采煤规程
    新华社抚顺4日电　抚顺市矿山和工厂的职工在庞观祥和周广瑞打破常规、大胆创造的精神的影响下，也纷纷设法改进自己的生产。老虎台煤矿、东北石油一厂和抚顺重型机器厂等7个单位的共产党员、青年团员和职工都分别举行了会议，研究如何在生产中学习庞观祥、周广瑞的革新精神。
    老虎台矿采煤区长丁义山，创造了接连式的煤层支柱，改革了矿井里沿用了40多年的单独支撑棚子的方法。过去抚顺煤矿使用的支柱都是单个支撑着煤层，在煤壁和支柱之间有1公尺多的空顶，因此不仅支柱的顶力小，而且采煤工人在空顶煤层下采煤，经常容易发生事故。丁义山创造的接连式支柱是把单个支架连接成为一个整体，支柱紧贴着煤壁，采煤工人就能安全地在支煤层的棚子下采煤。这一方法如在全矿采用以后，每年可以节约坑木5，000多立方公尺，节省12，000多人工。这个矿的另一个采煤区的工人，也打破了过去一层一层采煤的规程。工人们按煤层分别同时进行开采，改变了过去开采一层的时候，在一个采煤场子里拥挤着20多个人而周转不开的状况，使采煤效率提高了70％。
    东北石油一厂助理工程师王积信过去顾虑很多，不愿意提出改进生产的意见；现在他受了周广瑞的事迹的启发，最近研究出改进硫酸车间热交换器的办法，这个办法实行后，可以增加硫酸的生产量。
    据新华社抚顺4日电　庞观祥和周广瑞创造的采煤作业法，经过抚顺矿务局工程师的技术鉴定已经列为采煤规程的一部分。工程师们认为，他们创造的采煤作业法，是一种科学的、合理的先进方法，是从技术操作到劳动组织的综合性的改革。
