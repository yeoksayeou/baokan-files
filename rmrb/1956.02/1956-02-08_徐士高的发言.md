Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

	I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the various reports of the Vice-Chairmen.

	Regarding the issue of intellectuals, I personally believe that material待遇 (daiyu - treatment, compensation) should not be the primary concern for intellectuals themselves. Most intellectuals, after ten years of hard study in the old society, although their ideas of "saving the country through science" or "saving the country through industry" were somewhat naive at the time, still had some ambitions to do something, not just for their own material enjoyment. After liberation, they have received meticulous care and attention from the Party. Although their temporary treatment may not be particularly generous, compared to the past and to the lives of the vast majority of the people, there should be nothing more to say. And today, when the people of the whole country are working hard together to build our common, beautiful socialist society, intellectuals should have no reason not to share weal and woe with them. What intellectuals may care about, and perhaps care about most, is how their role can be brought into play, their progress, and the trust of the Party and the people. Although intellectuals are also part of the working class, they still have a series of non-working-class shortcomings. They beat around the bush when they speak, are unnecessarily sensitive, and pretend they don't want something when they actually do, thus falling into distress themselves, hindering their own work enthusiasm, and causing losses in work. Now that the Party has raised the issue of intellectuals with such meticulous care, I am confident that it can be resolved, but the main thing still lies with us intellectuals ourselves, how to actively strive for self-transformation, overcome shortcomings, pluck up the courage to embrace the Party, and cultivate our own working-class socialist initiative and sense of responsibility.

	Regarding the issue of carrying out scientific research work and actively improving scientific and technological levels. All patriotic scientific and technological workers, upon seeing the Party's call and Premier Zhou's report, are very excited and cannot suppress their inner excitement. This is something we could not have dreamed of in the old society. To catch up with the world's scientific level in 12 years is encouraging for us, but it is also an arduous task. This requires all of us scientific workers to bring into play all the power that can be brought into play, and to make full use of all the time that can be used. Therefore, today, as we begin to plan scientific research work, how various departments cooperate and collaborate with each other has also become a very important task. We must try our best to avoid "individual households" in scientific research work, so that the same problem is not being studied by you and me without any communication, resulting in duplication of work, offsetting strength, and wasting manpower and resources. In the past, many such phenomena have occurred in different departments. It is undeniable that intellectuals generally have the common problem of doing things their own way. In addition to the relevant competent authorities, my opinion is that the role of "academic organizations" in various departments should also be well utilized and brought into play for overall planning and good control of balanced cooperation. The academic societies of various relevant departments can and should have such a role. In various regions, through the activities of academic societies, the mutual relations between different units and different work positions can be flexibly communicated, thereby exchanging mutual ideas and research work information, and timely mutual learning, timely promotion of experience, and timely correction of errors can be achieved. However, at present, the activities of our academic organizations are mostly not satisfactory. The reasons hindering the development of academic activities, according to reflections from different aspects, are roughly: (1) Members are too busy with production work and cannot spare time; (2) Confidentiality restrictions make it inconvenient to exchange information with each other; (3) Academic societies are not valued, especially in some units, which believe that they have sufficient Soviet materials and direct guidance from Soviet experts, and do not need the help of academic societies, and that academic societies cannot help much, etc. Taking Shanghai as an example, the Electrical Engineering Society used to have more than 900 people. Although some members have wanted to do some work in recent years, they have always been unable to do so. I hope that the All-China Federation of Scientific Societies will pay attention to this work, and I hope that the Party can strengthen its leadership in this regard.

	The material and technical conditions for carrying out scientific research work require not only the necessary equipment, but also the necessary literature and book data. At present, in domestic libraries, it is rare to find a few complete sets of scientific journals (this means from the beginning of publication to the present). In most libraries, there are many Soviet journals, but they are all within the last ten years, and British and American journals are also incomplete. People may think that science needs new things, and outdated publications or documents are useless and do not need to be valued like ancient and rare editions in the cultural and historical research departments. This is not entirely correct. As far as library collections are concerned, the number of certain outdated materials and publications does not have to be large, but they cannot be absent. In some respects, the scientific and cultural level of a country is built up by these academic materials from beginning to end. I hope librarians will pay attention to this work.

	While actively improving our scientific level, I must also mention the popularization of science. Without a broad mass scientific foundation, it is not easy to build a solid scientific peak. Our socialist industrialization construction cannot be accomplished solely by a few scientists or engineers. How to enable the vast majority of the people to master the scientific knowledge they should understand is an extremely urgent and important task, and also an extremely arduous task. I am an electrical worker, and ordinary knowledge of electricity is urgently needed by the vast number of workers and peasants. According to incomplete statistics, in 1954 alone, more than 300 people died from electric shock in various cities across the country (and even more were injured). Most of these deaths from electric shock were caused by a lack of ordinary knowledge of electricity. After the development of our agricultural cooperativization, we will soon move to mechanization and electrification (a small part has already begun electrification). When this boundless expanse of the countryside is opened up, if this work is not done in a timely manner, the situation may be even more serious, which will be another kind of "pest and disease" in rural electrification. We must eliminate it in a timely manner. Other areas such as medicine and health, astronomy, geography, etc., are equally needed. Our scientific workers must take on this responsibility, which is also an unshirkable responsibility for every scientific worker.

	The era has given us too much work, which is our glory and our good fortune. We are fortunate and glorious to be born in the great Mao Zedong era, and we have full confidence and determination to complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party with a hundredfold effort.

    徐士高的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心拥护周恩来主席的政治报告及各位副主席的各项报告。
    关于知识分子的问题，我个人认为，从知识分子本身说，物质待遇不应是什么主要的问题。大部分的知识分子，在旧社会里十年寒窗，当时所想的“科学救国”或“工业救国”的想法虽很幼稚，但自己总尚是有点抱负，想作点事，不是只为了自己的物质享受。解放后，得到党无微不至的关怀与重视，虽然暂时的待遇尚不是特丰，但与过去比起来，与广大人民的生活比起来，不应再有什么可说的。而当全国人民一致艰苦努力为建设我们共同的美好的社会主义社会而奋斗的今天，知识分子也不应有什么不能同甘共苦的。知识分子可能关心自己的，也许是最关心的，尚是自己的作用如何发挥，自己的进步及党与人民的信任。知识分子虽然也是工人阶级的一部位，但总还有一连串的非工人阶级的缺点，说一句话要转多少个弯，不必要的敏感，想要什么东西，偏又装作不要，因而自己陷入苦闷，妨碍了自己工作的积极性，也造成工作上的损失。现在党把知识分子问题这样关怀倍至的提出来，深信是可以得到解决的，但主要的，也还在我们知识分子自己，如何积极努力自我改造，克服缺点，鼓起勇气来投向党的怀抱，培养自己工人阶级的社会主义的积极性与责任感。
    关于开展科学研究工作与积极提高科学技术水平的问题。所有爱国的科学技术工作者，看到党的号召及周总理的报告，都是非常兴奋，无法抑制内心的激动，这是我们在旧社会里所不能梦想的。要在12年内迎头赶上世界科学水平，这是值得鼓舞我们的，但也是艰巨的任务。这就要求我们所有科学工作者如何发挥出所有的可能发挥的力量，如何充分利用所有可能利用的时间，因此在开始规划科学研究工作的今天，各部门如何相互配合，相互协作，也成为一项很重要的工作，我们必须尽量避免科学研究工作中的“单干户”，免得同样一个问题，你也研究，我也研究而又互不往来，造成工作的重复，抵消力量，浪费人力物力。过去不同部门，曾发生过很多这类的现象。知识分子，不容讳言，一般是有着自搞一套的通病的。如何通盘规划，并很好的掌握平衡配合，除了有关主管机构外，我的意见还应很好的利用与发挥各部门“学会组织”的作用。各有关部门的学会是可以并也应该有这样的作用的。在各地区通过学会的活动，可以灵活的沟通不同单位、不同工作岗位的相互关系，从而交换相互思想及研究工作情况，可以收到及时的相互学习，及时的推广经验，及时纠正错误。但是目前我们学会组织的活动，大部分尚不够使人满意。妨碍着学会活动开展的原因，据不同方面的反映，大致为（1）会员生产工作太忙，抽不出时间；（2）保密限制，相互不便交换情况；（3）对学会不重视，特别是有的单位，认为自己有充分的苏联资料，有苏联专家直接指导，用不着学会帮助，学会也帮助不了什么等。拿上海来说，电机工程学会过去有900多人，几年来部分会员虽然很想搞点工作，但总是搞不起来，希望全国科联注意这一工作，并希望党能加强这方面的领导。
    开展科学研究工作的物质技术条件，不只要有应有的设备，还要具备应有的文献图书资料。目前在国内的图书馆内，就很少能找到几份整套的科学刊物（这是说自创刊开始到现在），在大多数的图书馆里苏联的杂志是很多了，但都是近十年以内的，英美的杂志也都残缺不齐。人们也许认为科学是要新的，过时的刊物或文献没有用，不必像文史研究部门那样重视古版珍本。这是不完全对的。就图书馆的收藏说，某些过时的资料刊物数量不一定要多，但不能没有。一个国家的科学文化水平，在某些地方，就是要用这些从头到尾的学术资料垫起来的。希望图书馆工作者，注意这一工作。
    在积极提高我们的科学水平的同时，我还必须再提一下关于科学普及工作。没有广大群众的科学基础，是不易建立起稳固的科学高峰的。我们社会主义工业化的建设，更不是专靠少数科学家或工程师所能办到的。怎样使广大的人民群众都能掌握了应该了解的科学知识，是一项极其迫切重要的工作，也是一项极繁重的工作。我是一个电业工作者，电的普通常识就是广大的工人以及农民所迫切需要知道的。据不全面的统计，过去1954年全国各城市里因触电而死亡的就有300多人（受伤的更多）。这些触电死亡事故，绝大部分都是因为没有用电的普通常识造成的。我们农业合作化展开后，很快即转入机械化电气化（小部分已开始电气化了），当农村这个一望无边的面展开之后，如果不及时做好这一工作，其情况可能更严重，这将同样是农村电气化中的一种“病虫害”。我们必须及时的消灭它。其他如，医药卫生、天文、地理等等，同样都是需要的。我们科学工作者，必须把这个责任担负起来，这也是每一个科学工作者义不容辞的责任。
    时代给我们的工作太多了，这是我们的光荣，也是我们的幸运。我们幸运的，光荣的生在伟大的毛泽东时代，有充分信心与决心百倍努力的完成党所交给我们的光荣任务。
