Strive to Eliminate Cotton Aphid Disaster Within Five Years
Zhu Hongfu, Deputy Director of the Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Eliminating crop diseases and insect pests is one of the important measures to ensure increased agricultural production. Many regions have included the elimination of several major crop diseases and insect pests within a certain period as an important part of their production plans. The cotton aphid is a major pest of cotton; in cotton-producing areas, great efforts should be made to eliminate it so that it no longer harms cotton.

The cotton aphid is a tiny animal with a strong reproductive capacity. They mostly lay eggs on several plants such as chickweed and pomegranate for the winter, and begin to hatch in March and April, reproducing for two or three generations before turning into winged aphids and flying out. However, at this time, the number of cotton aphids is not very large, and it is often not easy to attract people's attention. Later, they gradually increase, spreading from points and patches to the whole field in cotton fields. During the most serious period of aphid infestation in May and June, a large number of cotton seedlings often curl or even die. According to scientific experiments and observations, cotton production generally decreases by about one-third due to aphid infestation. Adding up the cotton that is lost nationwide due to cotton aphid damage is a huge loss!

The disaster caused by cotton aphids can be avoided. According to scientific research, it is already possible to find the laws of occurrence, reproduction and decline of cotton aphids. When the temperature in spring is higher than 12 degrees Celsius, cotton aphids begin to reproduce. Reproduction is most favorable between 16 and 22 degrees Celsius. When the temperature is higher than 25 degrees Celsius, the reproduction of viviparous female aphids decreases rapidly. When the temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius and the humidity is above 75%, these are conditions that are not suitable for the survival of cotton aphids. At this time, the number of cotton aphids will drop sharply, and a large number of cotton aphids will die. Such temperature and humidity generally appear around mid-July; at the same time, due to the scouring of rainwater, cotton aphids can suddenly decrease. After August, the weather turns cooler, and the development stage of cotton plants has also changed, and the aphid infestation can end. After September, cotton aphids begin to move to overwintering plant hosts to lay eggs for the winter.

By mastering the laws of occurrence and decline of cotton aphids, a series of measures can be further taken to prevent and eliminate them. Cotton aphids on overwintering plant hosts are the source of aphid infestation next year. Generally, the trend of aphid infestation in the current year can be predicted based on the number of eggs laid by overwintering cotton aphids and the survival rate after hatching. The extent of cotton aphid spread can be predicted based on the number of cotton aphid migrations and the occurrence cycle of winged aphids. Now we have methods for predicting and forecasting cotton aphids; therefore, as long as the relevant agricultural science departments strengthen the prediction and forecasting of crop pests, they can grasp the pest situation in advance, prepare for the prevention and control of cotton aphids, and avoid the passive situation of being caught off guard when aphid infestation occurs. Strengthening the prediction and forecasting of insect pests is already possible in many regions.

After years of observation and testing, it has been proven that cotton aphids are not born from the soil, nor are they brought by ants, but are migrated from weeds growing on roadsides, village edges, well edges, and gravesides. In the past, some farmers did not know the diffusion mode and path of cotton aphids and mistakenly thought that they were brought by ants, so they went to eliminate ants. In fact, this does not solve the problem. Weeds are a breeding ground for diseases and insect pests. In March and April, the weeds in North China are just sprouting. If they are removed at this time, the breeding and reproduction of cotton aphids can be prevented to a large extent, and the occurrence of cotton red spiders can be incidentally curbed, because they have many common host plants.

When aphids have occurred in large numbers and are harming cotton seedlings, it is necessary to actively use agents to control and eliminate them. Cotton farmers in many cotton-producing areas have accumulated certain experience in this regard. Derris root, derris extract, BHC, and 1605 are all agents that have been used and are effective. In recent years, my country has been able to produce a large amount of BHC powder, which is a good condition for controlling and eliminating cotton aphids. With the development of industry, the manufacture and supply of 1605 and other effective agents will definitely increase. However, the planting area of cotton fields in my country is very large. If we rely solely on chemical agents, difficulties may arise in supply and allocation. Therefore, various regions should also use local materials and use various effective agents. For example, tobacco and lime water can be used appropriately. When using agents to control and eliminate cotton aphids, it is necessary to grasp the appropriate timing. When cotton aphids are just occurring in points and patches, timely application of medicine and thorough elimination can prevent them from continuing to spread and expand; if you wait until the cotton seedlings have curled up before applying the medicine, the cotton plants will have been greatly damaged, and therefore the medicine cannot fully exert its effectiveness. This should be paid great attention to. The tools used for applying medicine should also be improved. In 1955, Henan and Hebei both used chicken feather carts, which can apply medicine to about 30 mu per day. This tool is very good for use during the cotton seedling stage, and can be mass-produced and used in various regions. With the development of agricultural mechanization, attention should also be paid to improving and promoting power-driven or horse-drawn medicine application tools.

According to our experiments in Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other provinces in the past few years, as long as the pest situation is grasped and appropriate measures are taken in a timely manner, it is possible to avoid yield reduction due to aphid infestation. Especially in the past two years, we have worked at the Anyang Cotton Farm in Henan, eliminated aphid infestation, and combined with other improvements in cotton planting technology, we have achieved bumper harvests year after year. These facts tell us that it is entirely possible to eliminate cotton aphid disasters.

Agricultural cooperativization has been basically realized in many regions across the country, and the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers for production has been unprecedentedly high. Controlling and eliminating cotton aphids has become a conscious demand of the vast number of cotton-growing farmers; at the same time, favorable material conditions have also been created. As long as the agricultural departments in various regions resolutely rely on the masses, closely cooperate with agricultural scientific and technical personnel, and strive to ensure that cotton aphids no longer cause disasters within five years, it can be achieved.

    争取五年内消灭棉蚜灾害
    中国科学院昆虫研究所副所长　朱弘复
    消灭农作物病虫害是保证农业增产的重要措施之一。许多地区都把在一定时期内消灭几种主要的农作物病虫害作为生产规划的一项重要内容。棉蚜是棉花的主要害虫；在产棉的地区都应该用很大的力量来消灭它，使它不再为害棉花。
    棉蚜是一种微小的动物，繁殖能力很强。它们多是在夏至草、石榴等几种植物上产卵过冬，三、四月间开始孵化，繁殖两三代后便变成有翅蚜飞出来；但是这时棉蚜的数量还不很多，往往不易引起人们的注意。以后，逐渐增多，在棉田中由点、片蔓延到全面。到五、六月间蚜害最严重时期，往往使大批棉苗卷叶甚至死亡。根据科学试验和观察的结果证明，由于蚜害，棉花产量一般要减产三分之一左右。把全国因为受棉蚜的害而少收的棉花加起来，是多么巨大的损失！
    棉蚜造成的灾害是可以避免的。根据科学研究，已经可以找到棉蚜的发生、繁殖和消长的规律。在春季气温高于摄氏12度的时候，棉蚜开始繁殖，在16度到22度之间对棉蚜的繁殖最为有利，当温度高于25度的时候，胎生雌蚜的繁殖便迅速减少，而当气温在摄氏25度以上、湿度在75％以上的时候，是棉蚜不宜生存的条件，这时棉蚜的数量将急遽下降，并且有大批棉蚜死亡，而这样的温度和湿度一般在7月中旬左右可以出现；同时，又因雨水的冲刷，棉蚜可以突然减少。8月以后天气转凉，棉株发育阶段也已经转变，蚜害便可结束。到9月以后棉蚜便开始转移到越冬植物寄主上产卵过冬。
    掌握了棉蚜的发生和消长的规律，就可以进一步采取一系列的措施防治和消灭它。越冬植物寄主上的棉蚜是明年蚜害的来源。一般地可以根据越冬棉蚜产卵量和孵化后的生存量推测出当年蚜害的趋势，根据棉蚜迁移的数量和有翅蚜的发生周期可以预测棉蚜的扩展情形。现在我们已经有了棉蚜预测预报办法；因此，只要有关农业科学部门加强对农作物虫害的预测预报工作，就可以事先掌握虫情，做好防治棉蚜的准备工作，就不至于等到蚜害发生的时候形成手忙脚乱的被动局面。加强对虫害的预测预报工作，目前在许多地区已经具备这样的条件了。
    经过多年的观察和试验证明，棉蚜并不是从土里生出来的，也不是蚂蚁衔来的，而是从生长在路边、村边、井边、坟边的杂草上迁来的。过去有些农民不知道棉蚜的扩散方式和途径，误以为是蚂蚁衔来的，而去消灭蚂蚁，这样做其实不解决问题。杂草是病虫害的温床，在3、4月间，华北一带的野草刚刚萌芽，如果在这时候把它除掉，就可以在很大程度上防止棉蚜的滋生、繁殖，并且可以附带地遏止了棉红蜘蛛的发生，因为它们的寄主植物有许多是共同的。
    当蚜虫已经大量发生，为害棉苗的时候，就必须积极地用药剂来除治。许多棉产区的棉农在这方面已经积累了一定的经验。鱼藤根、鱼藤精、六六六、一六○五都是用过而且有效的药剂；近年来我国已经能够大量生产六六六药粉，这是除治棉蚜的很好条件。随着工业的发展，一六○五和别的有效药剂的制造和供应一定会越来越多。不过，我国棉田播种面积很大，如果专靠化学药剂，在供应和调拨上都可能发生困难。因此，各地还应该就地取材，使用各种不同的有效药剂。例如烟草和石灰水等，都可以适当采用。用药剂除治棉蚜，必须掌握适当的时机。当棉蚜刚刚点、片发生的时候，及时施药彻底除治，就可以阻止它继续蔓延扩大；如果等到棉苗已经卷叶再施药，那时棉株就已经受到了很大的损害，因而也就不能使药剂充分发挥效用。这是应该十分注意的。施药用的工具，也要加以改进。1955年河南、河北都使用了鸡毛车，每天能施药30亩左右，这种工具在棉苗期使用很好，各地可以大量仿制使用。随着农业机械化的发展，也要注意改进和推广动力的或马拉式的施药工具。
    根据我们过去几年来在河北、河南、山西、陕西等省实验，只要掌握了虫情，及时加以适当的措施，都能做到不因蚜害而减产。尤其最近两年，我们在河南安阳棉场工作，消灭了蚜害，结合其他植棉技术的改进，连年取得丰收。这些事实告诉我们，消灭棉蚜灾害是完全可能的。
    全国很多地区已经基本上实现了农业合作化，广大农民生产积极性空前高涨，除治棉蚜已经成为广大棉区农民的自觉要求；同时，也已经具备了有利的物质条件。各地农业部门只要坚决依靠群众，密切地和农业科学技术人员合作，在五年以内使棉蚜不再造成灾害是能够争取做到的。
