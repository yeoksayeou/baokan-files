The state-owned Nanjing Automobile Manufacturing Plant has recently been approved by the State Planning Commission to be converted into a tractor manufacturing factory. The conversion project will be basically completed within two years.

After the conversion, this factory will be able to mass-produce Soviet ДT—24 type tractors. Trial production of tractors will begin this year, and small-batch production will be possible next year.

The factory's conversion work will be carried out on the principle of making the most of existing equipment and fully organizing collaborative production. At present, the factory has initially formulated a comprehensive plan and has begun various conversion preparations. Various special lectures and professional training classes have already been opened. At the same time, people have been sent to fraternal factories for internships and to understand production conditions at factories where cooperation is possible.

    国营南京汽车制配厂
    将改建成拖拉机制造厂
    国营南京汽车制配厂最近经国家计划委员会批准，决定改建成一座制造拖拉机的工厂。改建工程将在两年内基本完成。
    这个工厂经过改建以后，将能大量生产苏联ДT—24型拖拉机。拖拉机试制工作今年即将进行，明年可以小批生产。
    这个厂的改建工作将在尽量利用现有设备和充分组织协作生产的原则上进行。现在，厂里已经初步制定了全面规划，开始进行各项改建准备工作。各种专题讲座和专业训练班等已经开办。同时，还派人到兄弟工厂去实习，到可能协作的工厂去了解生产情况。
