Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 16th. The Shizitan Hydropower Station construction site in Sichuan Province is continuously expanding the scope of mechanized construction. From last year to the present, the hydropower station construction site has added more than 6 million yuan worth of machinery and equipment. Before the first quarter of last year, most of the stone excavation in the main projects was done manually, but now pneumatic drills, pneumatic picks, rock drills and other machines are widely used. Therefore, the original plan to excavate more than 900,000 cubic meters of stone in three years has now completed more than 76% in only one and a half years. The concrete pouring task of this hydropower station is very large. In the past, the large amount of river sand needed for mixing concrete was manually mined, which often could not keep up with the needs of the project. Now, dredging ships are used for digging and mining sand. The amount of river sand mined by a dredging ship every day is equivalent to the workload of hundreds of workers per day. In the fourth quarter of last year, a newly built mechanized concrete batching plant was put into production. The amount of crushed stone crushed by the crusher in this plant every day is equal to the workload of 1,000 people per day, and the entire plant can produce thousands of cubic meters of concrete every day to supply main projects such as dams, spillways, and water diversion tunnels.

    四川狮子滩水电站
    扩大机械化施工范围
    据新华社重庆16日讯　四川省狮子滩水电站工地不断扩大机械化施工范围。从去年到现在，这个水电站工地新增加价值600多万元的机械设备。去年第一季度以前，各主体工程的石方开挖大部分是用人工，现在普遍使用风钻、风镐、凿岩机等机械。因此，原来计划要在3年中才能挖完的90多万立方石方，到现在才一年半就完成了76％以上。这个水电站混凝土浇筑任务很大。过去拌和混凝土需用的大量河沙都用人工挖采，往往赶不上工程需要；现在挖沙采沙，使用的是挖泥船。一只挖泥船每天挖采的河沙量，相当于好几百个工人一天的工作量。去年第四季度，一座新建的机械化混凝土配料厂投入了生产。这个厂里单是碎石机每天压碎的碎石量，就等于1，000个人工一天的工作量，全厂每天可以配制成千立方公尺的混凝土，供应拦河坝、溢洪道、引水隧道等主体工程。
