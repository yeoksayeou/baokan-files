Pollitt's Congratulatory Message at the CPSU Congress

Dear Comrades! I am proud and honored to represent the Communist Party of Great Britain in extending warm and heartfelt congratulations to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
(Applause)

We are particularly pleased that this Congress has pointed out the glorious achievements of socialism and has set even greater goals for the Soviet people who are marching on the road to communism.

In the Soviet Union, power is in the hands of the people, they are full of confidence in the future, they have inexhaustible vitality, and they are formulating plans that are unprecedented in their scale, scope, and the courage to complete them.

In Britain, a handful of monopolists rule the entire economic and political life of the country, and people feel confused, uneasy, and lack confidence in the future. Since World War II, the British ruling group has pursued policies that violate the fundamental interests of the British people.

Their hatred of socialism and their attempts to continue to oppress the colonial people of the British Empire have reached such a point that they have sold out Britain's vital and fundamental national interests to American imperialism, and even agreed to the occupation of Britain by American army and air forces.

They have imposed huge military spending plans on Britain, which have weakened the British economy and caused chaos in the British economy, placing a heavy burden on the shoulders of the working people. While capitalists are making unprecedented profits, the working people are facing rising prices and rents, reduced housing construction, and the contraction of other public utilities, and they are paying the highest taxes in the world.

Although Britain has fought against German imperialism twice in the 20th century, the British government is now actively participating in the work of restoring and arming German militarism.

British imperialists are waging criminal and barbaric wars against the people of Malaya, Cyprus, and Kenya, trying to prevent the people of these countries from obtaining the rights that the British people have long enjoyed.

Hypocritical British imperialists are severely criticizing Comrade Khrushchev for his criticism of colonialism, while they are shedding the blood of the colonial people, trying to preserve the colonial system whose existence they vehemently deny.

Fortunately, resistance to the harmful policies of the Conservative Party and the right-wing Labour leaders is growing and will undoubtedly continue to grow in the future. This resistance is manifested in the countless movements of workers demanding higher wages, improved living conditions, and working conditions. This resistance is also manifested in the movement of hundreds of thousands of tenants against rent increases.

The British people are increasingly and resolutely expressing a strong desire for peace; this desire was particularly evident in 1955 when the British Peace Committee organized a massive national movement to send delegations to petition Parliament.

Right-wing Labour leaders are trying to suppress the people's movement, trying to reduce the movement to a sham struggle in Parliament, and trying to maintain the divisions in the workers' movement that they themselves have created. It is precisely because of this that the Conservative Party won the 1955 general election and is now able to launch a fierce attack on the workers.

The Communist Party stands at the forefront of the struggle, striving for the unity of the entire workers' movement and for the utilization of the powerful force of the workers' movement to fight for a new policy—a policy of peace and social progress. There is no doubt that our struggle has promoted this new policy, which is now being increasingly demanded. These demands have been put forward in many resolutions of national congresses of trade unions and other organizations of the working class.

In our work, we pay attention to building unity of action and unity on all issues concerning workers. At the same time, we believe that in order to accomplish our tasks at this critical juncture, we still have a lot to do, and we also estimate the extremely important role played by the British people and the British workers' movement.

We know that although the members of our party have done a lot of work, and although we have contributed to the cause of peace and the cause of defending the living standards of the working people, we still have to solve the problem of developing party membership in order to fully utilize the existing possibilities.

We are convinced that the congress of our party to be held in March will be a turning point in improving the work of our party, and that more and more people will not only support our recent demands, but also support our program—"The British Road to Socialism."

This program explains how the British people can turn bourgeois democracy into genuine people's democracy and transform Parliament (which was born out of the historical struggle for the realization of democracy in Britain) into a democratic organ representing the will of the vast majority of British residents.

At the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, I want to repeat the statement I made in Sheffield, a huge steelmaking center, in 1947 when the "Cold War" began: "British workers will never participate in a war against the Soviet Union." (Applause)

I have no doubt about this, just as in 1920, when London dockworkers refused to load military supplies onto the "Jolly George" and held excellent international solidarity demonstrations, contributing to the defense of the young Soviet Republic from foreign armed intervention. (Applause)

All members of our party will draw confidence and inspiration from the documents and resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The achievements of the Soviet people under the leadership of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union have aroused the fear and hatred of the enemies of the working people around the world. The Sixth Five-Year Plan has caused panic and unease among the imperialists because it proves the lofty peaceful construction goals of the Soviet government and the Soviet people. What they fear is not the fictitious millions of Soviet soldiers, but the 4 million university graduates, scientists, and engineers that the Soviet Union will have in five years.

However, the workers welcome and praise these glorious achievements and the Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union.

The working people of the world will forever be grateful to the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for showing the world the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

The Soviet Union is now the most powerful force for peace that mankind has ever seen. We are convinced that the Soviet Union, together with the People's Republic of China, the people's democracies of Eastern Europe, and the German Democratic Republic, together with the great people of India, the people of all capitalist countries and colonial countries, will be able to break the various plans of the war instigators and realize the most ardent desire of all mankind—to establish lasting peace.

The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will make new contributions to the cause of realizing this great goal. We congratulate the Congress and, with love and gratitude, extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Soviet people through it. (Applause)

Long live peace and the friendship between the Soviet people and the British people! (Applause)

Long live the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! (Applause)

Long live the leader of the Soviet people and the inspirer of the Soviet people's victory—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Marxist-Leninist Central Committee! (Stormy, sustained applause, all stand). (Originally published in the Soviet "Pravda" on February 19)

### 波立特在苏共代表大会上的贺词

    波立特在苏共代表大会上的贺词
    亲爱的同志们！我引以自豪的是，我能够荣幸地代表英国共产党向苏联共产党第二十次代表大会致以热烈的衷心的祝贺。
  （掌声）
    我们特别高兴的是，这次代表大会指出了社会主义的光辉成就，向走在共产主义道路上的苏联人民提出了更加伟大的目标。
    在苏联，政权掌握在人民手里，人们对未来充满着信心，他们有着无穷无尽的生命力，他们制定着按其规模、范围和完成的勇气来说都是空前的计划。
    在英国，一小撮垄断者统治着国家的全部经济和政治生活，人们对未来感到惶惑不安和没有信心。在第二次世界大战以后，英国的统治集团执行了违反英国人民的根本利益的政策。
    他们仇视社会主义和企图继续压迫不列颠帝国的殖民地人民竟达到了这种地步：他们把英国切身的根本的民族利益出卖给美国帝国主义，甚至同意美国的陆军和空军占领英国。
    他们把巨大的军备计划强加于英国，这个计划削弱了英国的经济并且引起了英国经济的混乱，把沉重的负担压在劳动人民的肩上。在资本家获得空前的利润的同时，劳动人民所遇到的却是物价和房租的上涨、住宅建设的缩减和其他公用事业的收缩，他们支付着世界上最高的赋税。
    虽然英国在20世纪中已经两次同德国帝国主义作战，但是英国政府现在却在积极参加恢复和武装德国军国主义的工作。
    英国帝国主义者正在对马来亚、塞浦路斯和怯尼亚人民进行罪恶的野蛮的战争，他们企图不让这些国家的人民获得英国人民早就获得的那些权利。
    伪善的英国帝国主义者由于赫鲁晓夫同志批评了殖民主义而对他大加责难，同时，他们却使殖民地的人民血流成河，力图保存他们矢口否认其存在的殖民制度。
    所幸的是，对保守党和右翼工党领袖有害政策的反抗，正在日益增长，并且毫无疑问，将来还将不断增长。这种反抗在工人要求提高工资、改善生活条件和劳动条件而举行的无数次运动中表现出来了。这种反抗也在几十万房客反对增加房租而举行的运动中表现出来了。
    英国人民愈来愈坚决地表示了要求和平的强烈意愿；在1955年英国保卫和平委员会组织派代表团到议会请愿的大规模全国性运动的时候，这种意愿表现得特别明显。
    右翼工党领袖们企图镇压人民运动，企图把运动缩小成在议会中进行的假斗争，并且企图保持住由他们一手造成的工人运动中的分裂。正因为这样，保守党在1955年大选中取得了胜利，并且现在还能够凶暴地向工人大举进攻。
    共产党站在斗争的最前列，争取整个工人运动的团结、争取利用工人运动的强大力量为新的政策——和平和社会进步的政策而斗争。毫无疑问，我们的斗争促进了现在人们日益要求实行的这种新政策。这些要求在工会和工人阶级其他组织的全国性大会的许多决议中都提出来了。
    我们在自己的工作中，着重注意到建立各种行动的一致和对一切有关工人问题上的一致。同时，我们认为，为了在目前紧要关头完成我们的任务，我们还得做很多事情，我们并且估计到英国人民和英国工人运动所起的极重要作用。
    我们知道，虽然我们党的党员做了许多工作，虽然我们对和平事业和保卫劳动人民生活水平的事业作了贡献，但是我们还要解决发展党员的问题，以便充分利用现有的可能性。
    我们深信，我们党将在3月间召开的代表大会，是改善我们党的工作的转折点，愈来愈多的人们将不但支持我们最近的要求，而且支持我们的纲领——“英国走向社会主义的道路”。
    在这一纲领中说明，英国人民怎样才能把资产阶级民主变成真正的人民民主，把国会（它是为了在英国实现民主而进行的历史斗争所产生的）改造成代表英国绝大多数居民意志的民主机关。
    在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上，我要重复一下1947年“冷战”开始时我在巨大炼钢中心设菲尔德所做的声明：“英国工人永远不参加反对苏联的战争。”（掌声）
    我对这点深信不疑，这正如1920年一样，当时伦敦码头工人曾经拒绝把军用物资装上“乔莱·乔治”号轮船，并且举行了出色的国际声援示威游行，为保卫年轻的苏维埃共和国免受外国武装干涉做了贡献。（掌声）
    我们党的全体党员将从苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的文件和决议中吸取信心，得到鼓舞。
    苏联人民在伟大的苏联共产党的领导下所获得的成就，引起了全世界劳动人民的敌人的恐惧和仇恨。第六个五年计划所以在帝国主义者中间引起了惊慌和不安，是因为它证明了苏联政府和苏联人民的崇高的和平建设目的。他们害怕的不是虚构的数百万苏联士兵，而是苏联在五年内将要得到的400万高等学校的毕业生、科学家和工程师。
    但是，工人们都欢迎和赞美苏联这些光辉的成就和五年计划。
    全世界的劳动人民都将永远感激苏联人民和苏联共产党，因为他们向全世界表明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。
    苏联现在是人类从来没有见过的最强大的和平力量。我们深信，苏联同人民中国、东欧各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国，同伟大的印度人民、各资本主义国家和各殖民地国家的人民一起，将能够打破战争挑拨者的各种计划，实现全人类最殷切的愿望——建立持久的和平。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在实现这个伟大目的的事业中将作出新的贡献。我们向代表大会祝贺，并且以热爱和感激的心情通过它向苏联人民致以衷心的祝贺。（掌声）
    和平及苏联人民和英国人民的友谊万岁！（掌声）
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会万岁！（掌声）
    苏联人民的领袖和苏联人民的胜利的鼓舞者——苏联共产党和它的马克思列宁主义的中央委员会万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声，全体起立）。（原载2月19日苏联“真理报”）
