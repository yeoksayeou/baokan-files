Moscow, February 23 (By Our Staff Correspondent) – The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) continued its discussion on the directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan at its morning session on February 23. Speakers included: Bobrovnikov, representative of the Moscow Party organization; Kosygin, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR; Orlovsky, Chairman of the "Dawn" Collective Farm in Belarus; Baibakov, Chairman of the State Planning Committee of the USSR; Maltsev, a collective farm scientist; Malyshev, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR; and Beshev, Minister of Railways of the USSR. At the morning session, Larsen, representative of the Danish Communist Party, Ghosh, representative of the Indian Communist Party, Lovlien, representative of the Norwegian Communist Party, and Encina, representative of the Mexican Communist Party delivered congratulatory speeches. Congratulatory letters from the Turkish Communist Party, the Algerian Communist Party, and the Colombian Communist Party were read at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow (via TASS) – The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union convened on the 22nd to continue its discussion of the report made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, on the directives concerning the Sixth Five-Year Plan at this Congress.

At the morning session, Kalchenko, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic, said that the new Five-Year Plan stipulates a magnificent program for a new upsurge in the country's economy and culture and puts forward extensive plans for the further development of the economy and culture of all the Union republics. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial output of Ukraine will approximately increase to 1.7 times.

Kunayev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic, said that Kazakhstan has become a republic with a powerful industry and mechanized agriculture. Last year, Kazakhstan's industrial production exceeded three times the pre-war level. Other sectors of the national economy, especially agriculture, have also achieved great development. The draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan show the greatest concern for the comprehensive development of the economy and culture of the Soviet Union's fraternal republics. In the next five years, the growth rate of Kazakhstan's capital construction and total output value will be faster than that of the Soviet Union as a whole. The total output value of all industries in the republic will increase to 2.2 times.

Those present warmly welcomed H. Bakdash, representative of the Syrian and Lebanese Communist Parties, who gave a congratulatory speech to the congress. He said that in Syria and Lebanon, as well as in Arab countries, millions of people feel friendly and grateful to the Soviet Union. In the period of national liberation struggle, the Arabs have always seen the socialist countries standing by their side. The Syrian people achieved victory in their struggle against American and British pressure, and the Soviet Union's open support for Syria played a major role in this victory. When all Arabs were fighting against the attempt by the United States and Britain to send troops to the Middle East, we saw that the Soviet Union repeatedly extended a hand of fraternal assistance to us. The Arab people hope to strengthen and develop their industry and agriculture, and on this path, they have also received friendly assistance from the Soviet Union, People's China, and other countries in the socialist camp. This assistance is provided without any conditions and does not harm its sovereignty and independence.

Following this, the representatives of the Japanese Communist Party and the Brazilian Communist Party successively read out their parties' congratulatory messages to the congress. They were warmly welcomed by those present.

At the afternoon session, Saburov, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, spoke. Representatives Melashkov, Chernyshev, and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Tevosian, also spoke.

When Tevosian spoke, he emphasized that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee are truly worthy of our great teacher V.I. Lenin. The Party is good at leading the creative initiative of the Soviet people, thus enabling heavy industry to develop at a high speed, a speed that far exceeds that stipulated in the initial years after the Great Patriotic War. Now, the country has a strong economic foundation, which can ensure that the output of metals, coal, and oil will greatly increase in the new Five-Year Plan, an increase that no previous Five-Year Plan has seen. The high-speed development of industry makes it possible for us to truly increase the number of products per capita, enabling us to confidently complete the Soviet Union's basic economic tasks.

H. Hagberg, representing the Swedish Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech. He said that the Swedish people highly appraise the Soviet Union's struggle for equal rights for all peoples, peaceful coexistence, and the relaxation of international tensions. The Soviet government's decision to return the Porkkala Peninsula to Finland, its support for Finland's neutrality, and its determination to guarantee the neutrality of other countries have been warmly received by the Swedish people.

E. Burnelle, representing the Belgian Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory speech to the Congress. He said that the Belgian people have shown great interest in the Soviet Union. Although the enemies of peace have fabricated many lies about the Soviet Union, the Belgian people will never allow themselves to embark on the dead end of anti-Soviet policies. The Soviet Union's firm and fruitful activities are conducive to the cause of peace. The Soviet Union's struggle to ban the atomic bomb, oppose the rearmament of West Germany, and its enormous increase in prestige have further strengthened the confidence of the working people who are struggling for a happy and independent Belgium.

The congress also read out congratulatory messages from the Popular Socialist Party of Cuba and the Communist Party of Chile.

    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在22日开会，继续讨论苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁就这次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示所作的报告。
    在上午会议上，乌克兰共和国部长会议主席卡尔钦科说，新五年计划规定了一个使我国经济和文化获得新高涨的宏伟纲领，并且对所有加盟共和国的经济和文化的进一步发展提出了广泛的规划。在第六个五年计划期间，乌克兰的工业生产总量大约将增加到一点七倍。
    哈萨克共和国部长会议主席库纳耶夫说，哈萨克已经变成了一个具有强大工业和机械化农业的共和国。去年，哈萨克的工业生产超过战前水平的三倍。国民经济的其他部门，特别是农业也获得了巨大的发展。第六个五年计划指示草案对苏联各兄弟共和国经济和文化的全面发展表现了最大的关怀。在今后五年中，哈萨克共和国的基本建设和总产值的增长速度要比全苏联快。共和国全部工业的总产值将增加到二点二倍。
    到会的人热烈欢迎哈·巴克达斯代表叙利亚与黎巴嫩共产党向大会致贺词。他说，在叙利亚和黎巴嫩以及在阿拉伯各国，千千万万的人都对苏联怀着友好和感激的心情。阿拉伯人在民族解放斗争的时期中，始终看见社会主义国家站在自己的身边。叙利亚人民在为反对美英压力而进行的斗争中取得了胜利，苏联所采取的公开支持叙利亚的立场，在这个胜利中起了重大的作用。当全体阿拉伯人为反对美英的往中东派遣军队的企图而进行斗争的时候，我们看到，苏联再三地向我们伸出兄弟般援助的手。阿拉伯人民希望加强和发展自己的工业和农业，而在这条道路上也得到了苏联、人民中国和社会主义阵营其他国家友谊的援助，这种援助没有附加任何条件，也不损害它的主权和独立。
    接着，日本共产党的代表和巴西共产党的代表，先后向大会宣读了他们的党给大会的贺词。他们受到了到会的人的热烈欢迎。
    在下午会议上，苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员萨布罗夫发了言。发言的代表还有梅拉什科夫、契尔奈谢夫和苏联部长会议副主席捷沃西安。
    捷沃西安在发言的时候强调指出，苏联共产党和它的中央委员会真不愧对我们的伟大导师弗·伊·列宁。党善于领导苏联人民的创造积极性，因而使重工业能够高速度地发展，这种速度大大地超过了卫国战争后最初几年内所规定的速度。现在，国家拥有强大的经济基础，能够保证金属、煤和石油的产量在新五年计划中大大增长，这种增长是过去任何一个五年计划所没有的。工业的高速度发展，使我们有可能真正地增加按人口计算的产品数量，使我们能够满怀信心地完成苏联的基本经济任务。
    希·哈格堡代表瑞典共产党致贺词。他说，瑞典人民对苏联争取各国人民权利平等、和平共处和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争，作了很高的评价。苏联政府交还芬兰波卡拉半岛的决定，它对芬兰中立的支持，以及它宣布保证其他国家中立的决心，获得了瑞典人民的热烈反应。
    埃·伯内尔代表比利时共产党向大会致贺词。他说，比利时人民对苏联表现了巨大的兴趣。虽然和平的敌人给苏联制造了很多谎言，但是比利时人民决不会让自己走上反苏政策的死路。苏联坚定的和富有成效的活动有利于和平事业。苏联所进行的禁止原子弹、反对西德重整军备的斗争和它的威信的巨大增长，更加加强了正在为争取幸福、独立的比利时而斗争的劳动人民的信心。
    会上还宣读了古巴社会主义人民党和智利共产党的贺词。
