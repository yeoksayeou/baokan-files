Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow delegates:

    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of the vice chairmen and Comrade Chen Boda. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC must resolutely implement the spirit of this conference in the future.

    After the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC was established in May last year, it followed the Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, carried out a series of conference activities in accordance with the requirements of Shanghai's socialist construction and socialist transformation. In the past eight months, we have convened five meetings of the Standing Committee and expanded meetings of the Standing Committee, organized 54 symposiums and report meetings of various types attended by committee members and people from all walks of life, and 14 working groups composed of more than 380 committee members and non-committee members, held a total of 46 meetings to discuss and negotiate more than 30 special issues. In addition, it organized eight on-the-spot visits and investigations, and held 30 secretary-general work meetings involving responsible persons from various democratic parties and people's organizations. As for the weekly study and discussion meetings, they have been held as scheduled, and the attendance rate of some study groups has averaged over 90%.

    Through the above activities, the work of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC has played the following roles in the political life of the people of Shanghai:

    First, through political consultation, consensus has been reached among people from all walks of life on major policies and ideas, the relationship within the people has been coordinated, and the implementation of various policies has been greatly facilitated. Like other parts of the country, Shanghai has carried out many major socialist reforms and transformations in the past year. Whether in the planned supply of grain, tightening Shanghai's population, the struggle against counter-revolutionaries in organs and social suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the struggle against Hu Feng and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique, and the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, we have encountered, but finally overcome, many differences and confusions in policies and ideas; With the support of various democratic parties and people's organizations, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, through political consultation, has played a pivotal role in clarifying policies, unifying understanding, and communicating the policy ideas of people from all walks of life in a timely manner.

    Second, on the basis of ideological unity, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC has repeatedly organized representative people from all walks of life to assist state organs in promoting major tasks, or put forward useful suggestions and plans for certain specific tasks. For example: for production arrangements, carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, unified allocation of labor to support construction in other places, strengthening production safety and labor protection, mobilizing farmers to return to their hometowns for production, implementing conscription laws, organizing junior and senior high school graduates to study on their own, promoting scientific and cultural work to face production, collecting opinions and reflections from various types of intellectuals in society, as well as municipal construction, environmental sanitation, non-staple food supply, etc., we have reflected opinions and demands from all parties, conducted specific discussions and research respectively, and assisted state organs in completing certain specific tasks.

    Third, through political consultation work and organized study, the unity within the people has been gradually expanded and consolidated, thus enriching the scale and substance of the people's democratic united front. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, the number of people from all walks of life participating in the regular work and study of the CPPCC has increased from more than 200 at the beginning to 639. Through symposiums and report meetings, a network of contacts has been established, totaling more than 1,100 people. The large report meetings hosted by the CPPCC sometimes expanded to 7,000 to 10,000 participants. In the big family of the united front, they believe that "they can get political warmth," "they can participate in major policies," "there are things to do, things to learn, and opinions to raise," and generally express "their willingness to contribute to the cause of socialism." And the elderly democratic figures, they actively put forward suggestions, report counter-revolutionary elements, and donate historical relics, often showing even more enthusiasm; recently, some people have even put forward the initiative to organize "elderly activist shock brigades." These facts are enough to show that in the embrace of the people's democratic united front, the socialist and patriotic enthusiasm of people from all walks of life is growing day by day, the unity within the people is further strengthened, and the remaining counter-revolutionary forces are more isolated.

    However, there are still many shortcomings and even errors in the work of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC.

    We have not expanded the scope of the CPPCC's work in accordance with the needs of the objective situation. People from all walks of life have many opinions about our failure to adopt various methods to absorb them to participate in activities. Regarding our study organization, they once said that we "neither graduate nor enroll," expressing dissatisfaction. This shows that our past work cannot meet objective requirements.

    Shanghai is not only a city with a concentration of industry and commerce, but also a city with a large amount of scientific, technological, cultural and artistic wealth hidden here. Recently, through investigation, we found that in the jurisdictions of many police stations, in addition to the on-the-job personnel of organs, enterprises and schools, dozens or even hundreds of intellectuals who have graduated from domestic and foreign colleges and universities and have other special skills can be found. Most of them do not have fixed jobs or do not have jobs at all. Although many of them have complex political histories or have committed some minor mistakes, the vast majority can still be educated and transformed into useful people. Some of them can be arranged, but they have not been arranged. This phenomenon urgently needs attention.

    Helping and urging the CPPCC district-level organizations to enrich their work content is very necessary for a big city like Shanghai. In the past period, we have not done enough. The institutions of some district CPPCCs were not sound, and the work was not regular. It was not until recently that the reorganization work was completed. At present, we are carrying out the study of the industrial and commercial circles and the investigation of intellectuals. In the future, the work of the CPPCC district-level organizations should be further strengthened.

    We believe that the reason why these problems exist in our work is that we lack political foresight in our work and have short-sighted, conservative, and utilitarian erroneous ideas. Our work is often satisfied with the completion of certain specific tasks and complacent; we are afraid of taking on burdens, afraid of causing trouble, and afraid that our subjective strength is insufficient to digest. Therefore, we are unwilling and do not know how to painstakingly study the situation and put forward comprehensive plans. This is the main root of our work shortcomings.

    Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, Shanghai is advancing rapidly on the road of socialism. The work of the CPPCC is arduous. At present, we must seize the time to do the following tasks well:

    First, for the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, the CPPCC should cooperate with state organs to conduct consultations and discussions on major issues such as asset verification, the implementation of fixed interest rates, and personnel arrangements; we have organized 301 democratic figures from all walks of life (divided into 43 working groups) to participate in the transformation work of various industrial and commercial sectors, so as to collect information, reflect problems, carry out sectoral consultation work, and quickly complete the entire task of joint state-private ownership. In the future, we will further organize 250,000 industrialists and merchants and their families into regular political theory studies by type through the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Minjian Branch, and the Democratic Women's Federation, and try to solve their labor training and mastery of living skills as much as possible.

    Second, for the work of senior intellectuals, we must complete the ongoing comprehensive investigation work in the shortest possible time, and through the CPPCC and various democratic parties and people's organizations, organize senior intellectuals who are scattered in the society and do not have fixed jobs to participate in work, or give them the opportunity to study, wait for state allocation, and participate in construction work in various places.

    Third, regarding the training and training of backbone members from all walks of life, we plan to prepare Marxist-Leninist theory study classes and party cadre training classes, and conduct rotational training in a planned manner.

    In the future, we must actively strive for the instructions of the National Committee of the CPPCC and the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, closely connect with the work of various departments of state organs, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, improve the ideological and political content of consultation work, enlighten the spirit of criticism and self-criticism of people from all walks of life, strive for self-transformation, mobilize all forces, and strive to complete the glorious and great socialist cause of the motherland.

    刘述周的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和各位副主席以及陈伯达委员的各项报告。我们政协上海市委会，今后一定要坚决贯彻执行这次大会的精神。
    政协上海市委会在去年5月间成立后，遵奉着中国人民政治协商会议章程，在中共上海市委的领导下，根据上海市社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的要求，开展了一系列的会务活动。8个月来，我们召开了常委会及常委扩大会议5次，组织了由委员和各界人士参加的各种类型的座谈会、报告会54次，由委员和非委员380余人共同组成的14个工作组，共举行了46次会议，讨论和协商了30余项专门问题。此外，并组织了8次实地参观和调查，以及举行了30次包括有各民主党派、各人民团体负责人参加的秘书长工作会议。至于每周一次的学习讨论会，亦能坚持如期举行，有些学习小组的出席率平均达到了90％以上。
    通过上述活动，政协上海市委会的工作，已经在上海人民的政治生活中起了如下几方面的作用：
    第一、通过政治协商，取得了各界人士对重大政策思想的统一，协调了人民内部的关系，大大地便利于各项政策的推行。上海和全国各地一样，过去一年，曾经进行过许多重大的社会主义改革改造工作，无论在粮食计划供应、紧缩上海人口、机关肃反与社会镇反、反对胡风、龚品梅反革命集团的斗争以及私营工商业的社会主义改造等工作上，都曾遇到了、但最后又克服了许多政策思想上的分歧和混乱；而政协上海市委会在各民主党派和各人民团体的支持下，通过政治协商方式，及时地发挥了阐明政策、统一认识、沟通各界人士政策思想的枢纽作用。
    第二、在思想一致的基础上，政协上海市委会曾多次组织各界代表性人士，协助国家机关推进了各项主要工作，或对若干具体工作提出了有益的建议和方案。例如：对于生产安排，开展增产节约运动，统一调配劳动力支援外地建设，加强生产安全与劳动保护，动员农民回乡生产，贯彻实施征兵法令，组织中小学毕业生自学，推动科学文化工作面向生产，收集社会各类知识分子的意见和反映以及市政建设、环境卫生、副食品供应等等，均曾反映来自各方面的意见和要求，分别进行了具体的讨论和研究，协助国家机关完成了一定的具体工作任务。
    第三、通过政治协商工作和组织学习，逐步地扩大和巩固了人民内部的团结，因而也充实了人民民主统一战线的规模和实质。政协上海市委会成立以来参加政协经常工作和学习的各界人士，已经由最初的200多人，扩大到639人，通过座谈会、报告会，建立了联系的对象，共有1，100余人。政协主持的大报告会，参加听讲人数，有时曾扩大到7，000人至1万余人不等。他们在统一战线的大家庭中，认为“能得到政治上的温暖”，“能参与大政方针”，“有事情可做，有东西可学，有意见可提”，普遍的表示“愿意为社会主义事业贡献自己一份力量”。而老年的民主人士，他们积极提出建议，检举反革命分子，捐献历史文物，往往表现得更加热情；最近有人甚至提出了要求组织“老年积极分子突击队”的倡议。这些事实足以说明在人民民主统一战线的怀抱里，各界人士的社会主义与爱国主义的热情，正日益滋长，人民内部的团结是更加增强了，残余的反革命力量是更加孤立了。
    但是，政协上海市委会的工作中的缺点甚至错误仍然是很多的。
    我们没有随着客观形势的需要放手扩大政协的工作面，各界人士对我们没有采取多种方式吸收他们参加活动，意见还很多。对于我们的学习组织，他们曾经说我们“既不毕业，又不招生”，表示不满。这就说明我们过去的工作是不能满足客观要求的。
    上海不但是一个工商业集中的城市，而且这里也潜藏着大量的科学、技术、文化、艺术的财富。最近我们通过调查，在许多派出所的辖区内，除机关、企业、学校的在职人员而外，都可以找到几十个甚至几百个国内外大专学校毕业和其他具有一定专长的知识分子。他们大都是没有固定工作岗位或者根本没有工作的人。他们中间虽然有不少是政治历史复杂或曾经犯过一些大小错误，但极大多数还是可以教育改造成为有用之人的。其中也有些人是可以安排而没得安排的。这种现象亟需引起重视。
    帮助和督促政协区级组织充实他们的工作内容，对于上海这样的大城市是很必需的。在过去一个时期里，我们做得十分不够。某些区政协机构不健全，工作不经常，直到最近才完成了改组工作。目前正在开展对于工商界的学习和知识分子的调查工作。今后政协区级组织的工作还应该进一步加强。
    我们觉得在工作上所以存在着这些问题，是由于我们在工作中缺乏政治远见，存在着短视的、保守的、功利主义的错误思想。我们的工作，往往满足于完成当前某些具体任务而沾沾自喜；我们怕背包袱，怕惹麻烦，怕主观力量不足消化不了。因而不愿意也不懂得刻苦的钻研情况，提出全面规划。这是我们工作缺点的主要根源。
    在中央的正确领导下，上海正在社会主义道路上飞速前进。政协的工作是繁重的。在当前，我们要抓紧做好下面几种工作：
    一、对于私营工商业的改造工作，政协要配合国家机关对清产核资、推行定息、人事安排等主要问题进行协商讨论；我们已组织了301位各界民主人士（分成43个工作组）参加了各个工商行业的改造工作，以便收集情况，反映问题，开展行业的协商工作，迅速完成公私合营的全部任务。今后，我们还要通过市工商联、民建分会、民主妇联进一步把25万工商业者及其家属分别类型组织经常的政治理论学习，并设法尽可能解决他们的劳动锻炼和掌握生活技能问题。
    二、对于高级知识分子工作，我们要在最短时间内完成正在进行的全面调查工作，要通过政协和各民主党派、各人民团体，把分散在社会上没有固定岗位的高级知识分子组织起来，参加工作，或者给他们学习的机会，听候国家调配，参加各地建设工作。
      三、关于培养和训练各界人士中的骨干分子，我们打算筹备马克思列宁主义理论学习班和党派干部训练班，有计划的进行轮训工作。
    今后我们一定要主动的争取政协全国委员会的指示和中共上海市委的领导，密切与国家机关各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体的工作联系，提高协商工作的思想内容和政治内容，启发各界人士的批评与自我批评的精神，努力自我改造，动员一切力量，为完成祖国光荣伟大的社会主义事业而奋斗。
