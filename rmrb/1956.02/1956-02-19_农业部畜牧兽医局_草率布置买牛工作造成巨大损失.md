Ministry of Agriculture Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau
Careless Arrangement of Cattle Purchase Work Caused Huge Losses

Editor:

    In order to massively breed dairy cows, the Ministry of Agriculture's Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau instructed the directly subordinate Chabei Ranch in August 1954 to purchase 500 head of yellow cattle. When they added to the plan in October 1954, they instructed the Chabei Ranch to purchase an additional 500 head of yellow cattle within the year. Buying these cattle was necessary, but the procurement time was too tight, making it difficult to guarantee the quality of the cattle purchased. At that time, the Ministry of Agriculture's financial planning department proposed a "buy and report actual expenses" method to ensure that special funds were not used across the year; however, the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau disagreed and insisted on purchasing 1,000 head of cattle within the year. The Chabei Ranch also felt that this procurement task would be difficult to complete within the year, but since it was an instruction from a higher authority, they had no choice but to comply. As a result, the head of the Chabei Ranch and relevant personnel irresponsibly bought back more than 700 head of old, weak, and sick cattle from food companies in various parts of Inner Mongolia. Because preparations were not made before the procurement, and no serious quarantine work was carried out during the procurement, 176 of these cattle died along the way and in the ranch due to hunger, disease, and cold, and most of the remaining cattle were not suitable for breeding. This incident caused great losses to the state.

    After this, the Ministry of Agriculture's Supervision Department successively received letters from the people forwarded by the State Council and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, requesting that this matter be dealt with seriously. The Ministry of Agriculture's Supervision Department sent people to the Chabei Ranch to conduct an inspection, which proved that the masses' accusations were completely in line with the facts. Although the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau had made several self-criticisms to the Ministry of Agriculture, it did not humbly examine its own responsibility for this matter, so that this matter has been delayed until today without being dealt with. I believe that the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau's attitude of being unwilling to face up to shortcomings in its work is very bad, and I hope you will urge the Ministry of Agriculture to seriously handle this matter.

    农业部畜牧兽医局
    草率布置买牛工作造成巨大损失编辑同志：
    农业部畜牧兽医局为了大量繁殖乳牛，在1954年8月曾经指示直属察北牧场采购黄牛500头。到1954年10月追加计划的时候，他们又指示察北牧场在年内增购黄牛500头。买这些牛是有需要的，但是采购时间太紧，买牛的质量就难于保证。当时，农业部财务计划部门为了保证专款不跨年度使用，曾经提出“实买实报”的办法；但是畜牧兽医局不同意，坚持要在年内采购1，000头牛。察北牧场也感到这项采购任务在年内难于完成，但是既然是上级指示，也只好照办。结果，察北牧场场长和有关人员就不负责任地在内蒙古各地食品公司买回了700多头老弱病牛。由于采购前没有做好准备工作，采购时又没有进行认真的检疫工作，以致这批牛在沿途和牛场里因饿、病、冻而死掉了176头，剩下的牛绝大部分也都不适于繁殖。这件事情，使国家遭受了很大的损失。
    在这以后，农业部监察室连续接到国务院、最高人民检察院转来的人民来信，要求对这件事情进行严肃的处理。农业部监察室派人到察北牧场作了检查，证明群众的检举完全符合事实。畜牧兽医局虽然曾经向农业部作了几次检讨，但是并没有虚心检查自己对这件事情应负的责任，以致这件事情拖到今天还没有得到处理。我认为，畜牧兽医局工作中有了缺点而不愿正视的态度是很不好的，希望你们督促农业部严肃处理这件事情。
