Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Lu Zhiwei, Director of the Text Reform Group of the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, today again accused the US authorities of creating difficulties that prevent his son from returning to the motherland.

He said, "Someone in the United States must have done something to make my son afraid to publicly say that he wants to return to the motherland. The Associated Press report on February 23rd, in which my son was interviewed, confirms this."

The Associated Press reported that Lu Zhuoru, who is currently working at the Ames Laboratory of Atomic Energy in Iowa, USA, was unwilling to express his opinion on the issue of returning to China because he said that this matter "might only make things worse for both sides." Lu Zhiwei said, "I am sure my son wants to come back. However, he is being subjected to unreasonable pressure from the outside world. The way he answered the questions, so cautiously and vaguely, indicates that there must be some problems. He never spoke like this in the past.

"We have written him at least 20 letters, some of which were written jointly by the whole family. My son told the Associated Press reporter that he had only received two letters. This fact once again proves that pressure has been put on him over there.

"We have not received a letter from him since April 1952. Before that, he often wrote to say that he wanted to return to China."

Lu Zhiwei said, "My wife is very worried about our son. She has not seen him for almost 10 years. Her health is poor and she is often sick. We are looking forward day and night to his return to the motherland."

    陆志韦再度指控美当局
    新华社28日讯　中国科学院语言研究所文字改革组主任陆志韦今天再度指控说，美国当局制造的困难使得他的儿子不能回到祖国来。
    他说，“在美国一定有人干了什么勾当使我的儿子不敢公开说他要回到祖国来。美联社2月23日发出的一则访问我的儿子的消息就证实了这一点。”
    美联社的消息说，现在在美国衣阿华州阿密斯原子研究所工作的陆卓如对于回国问题不愿意表示意见，因为他说，这件事“可能只会把双方的事弄得更糟。”陆志韦说，“我敢肯定我的儿子是想回来的。不过他受到了外界的无理的压迫。他回答问题时那样小心，那样含糊，说明其中一定有些问题。他过去说话从来不是这样的。
    “我们至少给他写了20封信，其中有几封是全家合写的。我的儿子向美联社记者说他只收到过两封信。这件事实再一次证明了那边对他是施加了压力的。
    “从1952年4月以后，我们就没有接到他的信。在那以前，他常写信来说他要回国。”
    陆志韦说，“我的妻子非常挂念我们的儿子。她已经快有10年没有看见他了。她的身体不好又常害病。我们日夜都在盼望他能回到祖国来。”
