    Let Us "Liberate" Ourselves from Official Documents and Correspondence
    Editor:
    I am a staff member of the Industry and Commerce Section of Taihu County, Anhui Province. In my work, I deeply feel that some of our government agencies have far too many official documents and correspondence. In 1955, our section alone had more than 2,700 incoming and outgoing official documents and letters (excluding telegrams). The entire section has four staff members (including the section chief), with each person handling an average of more than 600 pieces. In reality, many staff members in county-level agencies often have to go to the countryside to work, and in our section, there is often only one person at home handling official business. This huge amount of official documents and correspondence has therefore become a major obstacle to carrying out normal business.
    Are all these official documents and correspondence necessary for our work? No, they are not. Among the more than 2,700 pieces of official documents and correspondence received by our section, 2,100 were copies, accounting for more than 75% of the total. 90% of these copies were completely unnecessary. For example, fires occurred in the commercial departments of Foziling, Qianshan, and Zhegao one after another. The province issued a circular, the Special Commissioner's Office issued a circular, and the Anqing Department Store branch also issued a circular. Several documents are issued for one event, and such situations are very common. For another example, the Huqiu District Health Center in our county owed the Anqing Pharmaceutical Company 129.89 yuan. Instead of contacting the health center directly, the pharmaceutical company wrote an official document addressed to the Huqiu District Health Center, with copies sent to the Taihu County Industry and Commerce Section and the Health Section. In addition, some units, without considering the nature and scope of the matter and the leadership level, unnecessarily addressed a document to many units.
    I want to do my job well, and I want to carefully study my work; therefore, I urge the relevant authorities to quickly overcome bureaucracy and liberate us from official documents!　　　　Chen Yifu

### 让我们从公文函电里“解放”出来

    让我们从公文函电里“解放”出来
    编辑同志：
    我是安徽太湖县工商科的工作人员。我在工作中深深感到，我们有些机关的公文函电实在太多了。1955年度，我们科的来往公文函件（电报在外）就在2，700件以上；全科四个工作人员（包括一个科长在内），每人平均要处理600多件。而实际上，县级机关的很多工作人员往往要下乡工作，我们科经常在家办业务的工作人员只有一个人，因此这样大量的公文函件就更成为开展正常业务的一个巨大障碍了。
    这些公文函件是否都是工作需要的呢？不是的。我们科收到的2，700多件公文函件中，抄件（副本）有2，100件，占总数的75％强；这些抄件有90％是根本不必要发的。例如，佛子岭、潜山、柘皋三地商业部门接连发生失火事件，省里通报一次，专署通报一次，而安庆百货分公司又通报一次。一件事情出现好几个文件，这样的情况是很多的。又如，我县虎丘区卫生所结欠安庆医药公司货款129.89元，医药公司不是同卫生所直接联系，却写了一个公文主送虎丘区卫生所，抄送太湖县工商科和卫生科。此外，还有些单位不考虑事情性质范围和领导层次，将一个文件毫无必要地主送了很多单位。
    我希望做好工作，我希望细心钻研业务；因此我要求有关机关赶快克服文牍主义，使我们从公文里解放出来！　　　　陈毅夫
