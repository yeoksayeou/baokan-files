    Sixth Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    Congratulatory Telegram from Soong Ching Ling and Qian Junrui to Denisov
    To Comrade Denisov, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries:
    On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I extend to you and, through you, to all the Soviet people, the warmest congratulations.
    In the past six years, the friendly cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union has greatly developed, which has had a tremendous and profound impact on the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union. In particular, the comprehensive and selfless assistance given to our country by the Soviet government and the Soviet people has played an outstanding role in the completion of our economic recovery and the victorious advance of socialist construction. The Chinese people deeply feel the supreme value of this fraternal friendship and express their heartfelt gratitude.
    The consolidation and development of the Sino-Soviet alliance has had an inestimable impact on maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. The struggle of China and the Soviet Union on a global scale to strive for the relaxation of international tensions and defend world peace has severely frustrated the war policy of the American aggressive bloc. We firmly believe that the Sino-Soviet alliance will increasingly play its powerful bulwark role in the cause of continuing to oppose aggression and defend world peace.
    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will redouble its efforts to carry out more intense and in-depth work to further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship

    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订六周年
    宋庆龄、钱俊瑞致杰尼索夫的贺电苏联对外文化协会理事会杰尼索夫主席：
    欣逢中苏友好同盟互助条约签订六周年，谨代表中苏友好协会全体会员向您并通过您向全体苏联人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    六年来，中苏两国人民的友好合作，有了极大的发展，这对中苏两国的繁荣给予了巨大和深厚的影响。特别是苏联政府和苏联人民给予我国全面的无私的援助，对于我国经济恢复工作的完成和社会主义建设的胜利前进，起着卓越的作用。中国人民深切地感到这种兄弟友谊的无上珍贵，并表示衷心的感谢。
    中苏友好同盟的巩固和发展，对于维护远东和世界和平产生了不可估计的影响。中苏两国在世界范围内为争取和缓国际紧张局势和保卫世界和平的斗争，使美国侵略集团的战争政策受到了严重的锉折。我们坚信，中苏友好同盟在继续反对侵略，保卫世界和平的事业中必将日益发挥它的强大的堡垒作用。
    中苏友好协会将要加倍努力，进行更加紧张的和深入的工作，以进一步加强中苏友好和向苏联学习，为完成我们祖国的社会主义建设和巩固世界和平而奋斗。
    中苏两国人民之间的伟大的牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
                              中苏友好协会总会 会  长 宋庆龄
                                            秘书长  钱俊瑞
                                      1956年2月11日于北京
