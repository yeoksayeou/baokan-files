Comrades and fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. I also agree with the reports made by Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Dong Biwu, Chen Shutong, and Committee Member Chen Boda.

I am a children's worker. As our people across the country are jubilantly marching towards socialism, and as our great leader calls on us to strive to rapidly catch up with the advanced levels of world science, I cannot help but think first of the younger generation of children, of the successors to our great cause.

Of course, children cannot capture scientific fortresses today. However, as a task for the whole nation, to advance towards science, then children are a vast and indispensable reserve force. This is not only because many of today's senior primary and junior high school students will graduate from university in twelve years and directly supplement the ranks of intellectuals, but also because to catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels, it is also necessary to universally improve the scientific and cultural level of our people, especially the scientific and cultural level of the new generation. So I want to talk about the scientific and technological education of children.

In August last year, we, together with the Ministry of Education, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the National Committee for the Defence of Children of China, and the Science and Technology Popularization Association, jointly held a National Children's Science and Technology and Craftwork Exhibition, which exhibited a total of 1,009 scientific, technological, and craft works by children from all over the country. Many of these works were excellent, embodying the correct principle of combining theory with practice, and also reflecting children's rich imagination, persistence, and creativity. For example, the "Ideal Meteorological Station" made by the Meteorological Group of Yimiao District Central Primary School in Shanghai and their meteorological records, which have never been interrupted for a single day in the past four years; the automatic electric shovel made by two children from Beijing No. 40 Middle School and No. 32 Middle School; the sunflowers with particularly large seeds cultivated by the Michurin Group of Yuqian Jiaokou Township Primary School in Zhejiang... and many other works, have won praise from the general public. In October last year, under the influence of the announcement of the First Five-Year Plan and the people's active engagement in socialism, children in Beijing, Yixing, and Fuxian proposed to carry out "Little Five-Year Plan" activities, and now this activity has been enthusiastically launched among children all over the country. In their spare time, children collect tree seeds, plant trees and afforest, help agricultural production cooperatives to pick grain, accumulate fertilizer, eliminate pests and harmful birds, and protect beneficial insects and birds, help schools make teaching aids... In these activities, children not only increase their desire to prepare to build a socialist motherland, but also increase a lot of practical scientific and production knowledge.

However, children face many difficulties in carrying out these activities. First of all, this is because in the past, school education was divorced from reality and production, and many teachers still do not know how to guide this kind of activity, and some do not pay attention to this kind of activity. For example, a primary school in Shandong planted cypress trees, and because of the lack of technical guidance, more than half of them died, and the children were very sad. Secondly, children have little knowledge and rarely see new machines and various technical equipment, and there are no scientific and technological books suitable for them to read. Two children in Beijing ran to the Soviet Exhibition Hall several times in order to make an automatic electric shovel. Again, there is no suitable equipment and materials, and there is no special scientific and technological guidance organization for children, so the technical level of the last exhibition was very backward. The entire exhibition had only two lathes, and the styles were very old; most of the works were made of paper and wood, and very few were made of metal, which means that most children used hand tools – scissors and paste – to make them, and had no experience in using modern production tools; in terms of power machinery, there was only one internal combustion engine.

Therefore, in order to meet the requirements of children's scientific and technological activities and cultivate their interest in science and technology from an early age, a series of measures need to be taken. We suggest: (1) Accelerate the implementation of comprehensive technical education in middle and primary schools. Strive to set up experimental gardens, studios, or technical corners in all middle and primary schools with conditions within two years; establish handicraft groups and gardening groups in the upper grades of primary schools, establish various technical groups and natural science groups in junior high schools, and strengthen the technical guidance for the "Little Five-Year Plan" activities. (2) Strive to establish juvenile technical guidance stations in industrial cities and large cities, and establish natural science guidance stations in provinces within three years, to specifically guide children's scientific and technological activities. This year, the relevant central departments can try to set up a juvenile technical guidance station in Beijing. It is also possible to consider establishing a factory that supplies materials and tools for children's scientific, technological, and craft activities. (3) Organize a juvenile science and technology magazine. (4) Factories, farms, agricultural technology extension stations, etc., should help schools carry out scientific, technological, and craft activities, and guide children's visits, experiments, production, and planting activities. The relevant industrial and agricultural departments should strengthen the propaganda of science and technology, and hold more industrial and agricultural production technology exhibitions. (5) Experts and scientists should spare time from their busy scientific research and teaching work to guide children's scientific and technological activities and meet with them (of course, we must also do a good job in organization so as not to overburden the experts), because you will give them great encouragement.

We earnestly hope that relevant departments and experts and scientists can support this work. This is the first issue I want to talk about.

In addition, I would also like to offer some opinions on the progress of educated youth, especially the children of those in the socialist hostile camp, based on my own experience. Perhaps some of you know that I am Chen Bulei's daughter. More than a decade ago, I was also a young student with enthusiasm and distress. In order to find a way to resist Japan and save the nation, I found the Communist Party. The Party guided me onto the road of revolution, so that I not only saw the future of national liberation, but also saw the future of social liberation, and my distress disappeared. I listened to the Party, worked, studied, and moved forward, and I felt infinitely warm and happy. Over the past decade, thanks to the Party's education, I have made certain progress. I am now a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Deputy Director of the Children's Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. From the path I have taken, I deeply feel that it is precisely because the Party is based on the interests of the country and the people that it welcomes and cares for everyone with patriotic enthusiasm, no matter who they are. But I heard that there are still some young people from exploiting classes and reactionary families who are troubled by their origins, saying something like "I only hate that the King of Hell sent me to the wrong womb." I think this is completely unnecessary. If it was relatively difficult for a young person from an exploiting class and a reactionary family to recognize the Party before liberation, then today, the Party is like the sun, shining on the earth and nurturing each of us. We have no way to choose our place of origin, but we are fully able to choose the path we want to take. As long as we recognize the right direction and are willing to work hard, there are broad roads and great prospects in front of each of us. Even the young people who are still in Taiwan now, after listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's report, you will not find it difficult to find this direction, that is, to stand on the banner of patriotism, and together with the people of the motherland, completely liberate Taiwan and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Young people are the most promising, so young people are also most concerned about the fate of the motherland; as a young person who has also personally experienced the enslavement and oppression of imperialism and worried about the fate of the country, I have the deepest sympathy for your current situation. But you see: on the land of the motherland, a ray of light has risen, and together with the 600 million people of the motherland, we are bound to overcome the darkness. I believe that the young people in Taiwan, who have a glorious tradition of patriotism, are strong, brave, and must be victorious.

    陈琏的发言
    各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告。我也同意李济深、郭沫若、董必武、陈叔通副主席和陈伯达委员所做的各项报告。
    我是一个儿童工作者，当我们全国人民正在欢欣鼓舞地奔向社会主义的时候，当我们伟大领袖号召我们为迅速赶上世界科学先进水平而奋斗的时候，我不能不首先想到少年儿童一代，想到我们伟大事业的接替人。
    当然，要在今天去夺取科学堡垒，少年儿童是不行的。但是，作为全民的任务，要向科学进军，那么，少年儿童就是一支庞大的、不可缺少的后备队伍。这不仅是因为今天的许多高小、初中学生在十二年以后就可以在大学毕业，直接地补充到知识分子的队伍中去；而且还因为要赶上世界先进科学水平，还必须普遍地提高我国人民的科学文化水平，特别是新一代的科学文化水平。所以我想谈一点少年儿童科学技术教育问题。
    去年8月间，我们和教育部、全国总工会、中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会、科学技术普及协会等单位联合举办了一次全国少年儿童科学技术和工艺作品展览会，展出了全国各地少年儿童科学技术和工艺作品共1，009件。其中有不少作品是很优秀的，体现了理论联系实际的正确方针，也反映了儿童丰富的想像能力、坚持性和创造精神。譬如上海市邑庙区中心小学气象小组制作的“理想的气象台”和四年来从来没有间断过一天的气象记录；北京市四十中学和三十二中学两个孩子制作的自动电铲；浙江于潜交口乡小学米丘林小组培植的、棵粒特别肥大的向日葵……等许多作品，都曾经博得了广大观众的称赞。去年10月在第一个五年计划公布和祖国人民积极搞社会主义的影响下，北京、宜兴、复县的少年儿童提出了开展小五年计划的活动，现在这一活动已经在全国各地的少年儿童中间热烈地开展起来了。孩子们在课余时间采集树种、植树造林，帮助农业生产合作社拣粮、积肥、消灭害虫害鸟和保护益虫益鸟，帮助学校制作教具……在这些活动中，孩子们不仅是增长了准备建设社会主义祖国的愿望，也增长了许多实际的科学和生产知识。
    但是，孩子们在进行这些活动时是有不少困难的，这首先是由于过去学校教育脱离实际、脱离生产，许多教师还不会指导这种活动，有的还不重视这种活动，譬如山东有一个小学种柏树，由于缺乏技术指导，死了有一半以上，孩子们非常伤心。其次，孩子们的见闻很少，很难得看到新的机器和各种技术装备，也没有适合他们看的科学技术书籍，北京两个孩子为了制作自动电铲，跑了好几次苏联展览馆。再次，没有适当的设备和材料，没有专门的少年科学技术指导机构，所以上次展览会从技术水平来讲是非常落后的。整个展览会只有两个车床，而且式样非常陈旧；绝大部分作品是纸工、木工制作，很少金工作品，这也就是说绝大多数儿童都是用手工工具——剪刀浆糊——来制作的，没有使用现代生产工具的锻炼；在动力机械方面，只有一个内燃机。
    因此，为了满足儿童科学技术活动的要求，从小培养科学技术的兴趣，需要采取一系列的措施。我们建议：（1）要加速在中、小学校中实施综合技术教育。争取在两年内凡是有条件的中、小学校都要设置实验园地、工作室或技术角；在小学中、高年级成立巧手小组和园艺小组，在初中成立各种技术小组和自然科学小组，并加强对“小五年计划”活动的技术指导。（2）争取在三年内，在工业城市和大城市成立少年技术指导站，在省里成立自然科学指导站，以具体指导少年儿童的科学技术活动。今年就可以由中央各有关部门在北京试办一个少年技术指导站。并且还可以考虑建立一个供应少年儿童科学技术和工艺活动的材料和工具的工厂。（3）要筹办一个少年的科学技术杂志。（4）工厂、农场、农业技术推广站等都要帮助学校开展科学技术和工艺活动，指导儿童的参观、实验、制作和种植活动。工农业有关部门要加强科学技术的宣传工作，多举办工农业生产技术展览会。（5）专家、科学家要在繁忙的科学研究和教学工作中，抽空指导儿童的科学技术活动，和他们见面（当然，我们也要做好组织工作，不使专家负担过重），因为你们会给他们很大的鼓励。
    我们迫切地希望各有关部门和专家、科学家能够支持这一工作。这是我要讲的第一个问题。
    另外，我还想以自己的经验，对于知识青年、特别是社会主义敌对阵营里的儿女们的进步问题，说一些意见。也许在座有的同志是知道的，我是陈布雷的女儿。在十几年前，我也是一个怀抱着热情和苦闷的青年学生。为了寻求抗日救亡的途径，我找到了共产党。党把我引导到革命的道路上来，使我不但看到了民族解放的前途，也看到了社会解放的前途，我的苦闷消失了。我听党的话，工作着，学习着，前进着，我感到无比的温暖和幸福。十几年来，由于党的教育，我获得了一定的进步，我现在是青年团中央委员会的委员并担任着青年团中央少年儿童部的副部长。从我自己走过的道路，我深深地感觉到：正是因为党是以国家和人民的利益为依归的，因此，它对于一切有爱国热情的人，不管他是什么人，都是欢迎和爱护的。可是我听说目前还有一些出身剥削阶级和反动家庭的青年为自己的出身感到烦恼，说什么“恨只恨阎王爷把我投错了胎”，我认为这是完全不必要的。假如说在解放以前，一个出身剥削阶级和反动家庭的青年还比较不容易认清党的话，那么在今天，党就像太阳一样，普照着大地，抚育着我们每一个人。我们没有办法选择我们的出身之地，但是我们完全能够选择自己要走的道路，只要我们认对了方向，而且肯于努力，在我们每一个人面前都是有宽广的道路和远大的前程的。就是现在还在台湾的青年，你们听了周恩来总理的报告，你们也不难找到这个方向的，那就是站到爱国主义的旗帜下来，和祖国人民一道，彻底解放台湾，早日回到祖国的怀抱里来。青年是最有前途的，因此青年也最关心祖国的命运；作为一个也曾经亲历过帝国主义的奴役和压迫，忧心过祖国危亡的过去的青年，我对你们今天的处境，有着最深切的同情。但是你们看到：在祖国的大地上，已经升起了万丈光芒，和祖国六万万人民在一道，我们是一定要战胜黑暗的。我相信有着光荣的爱国主义传统的台湾青年是坚强的、勇敢的、而且一定要胜利的。
