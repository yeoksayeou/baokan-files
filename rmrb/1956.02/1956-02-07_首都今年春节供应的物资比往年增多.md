Capital City's Spring Festival supplies have increased significantly compared to previous years. Meat has increased by more than 650,000 jin, and apples, bananas, and other fruits have increased by more than 180,000 jin. Joint state-private enterprises are participating in the state-owned commercial sector's planned supply work this year, and their Spring Festival supply of fruits and meats has increased by 10% and 50% respectively compared to last year.

    Currently, the Beijing Municipal State-Owned Commercial Department is actively helping joint state-private stores to do a good job in supplying goods for the Spring Festival. Wholesale personnel from the China Department Store Beijing Company are going to each household with samples to help with purchases. In order to ensure a good job in supplying goods for the Spring Festival, joint state-private stores have universally launched business competitions by industry. The friendship challenge between the six industries of pastries and sweets, native products and foods, and oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar in the Qianmen district has already begun. Department stores in the Dashilar and Qianmen Avenue areas have increased their range of goods by more than 1,000 items. Only the Xiangju public pastry shop has added more than 20 kinds of popular foods such as horseshoe cakes and honey hemp candies. The joint state-private Daoxiangchun native products and food store has been receiving nearly 10,000 customers daily to buy seasonal foods in recent days. The sales of newly added South candies, cream raisins, black sesame pine nut yuanxiao, and candied fruits and preserves have increased by more than double compared to usual.

    首都今年春节供应的物资比往年增多
    首都今年春节供应的物资，比往年增加很多。肉类增加65万多斤，苹果、香蕉等增加18万多斤。公私合营商店今年都参加了国营商业部门的计划供应工作，它们春节供应的水果、肉类比去年增加10％和50％。
    现在北京市国营商业部门正积极帮助公私合营商店做好春节物资供应工作。中国百货公司北京市公司的批发人员带着样品深入到各户帮助进货。为保证做好春节供应工作，各公私合营商店已普遍按行业展开业务竞赛。前门区糕点糖果、土产食品、油盐酱醋等6个行业之间的友谊挑战已开始。大栅栏、前门大街一带百货商店增加了1，000多种商品。只祥聚公糕点铺就增加了马蹄酥、蜜麻糖等20多种为群众欢迎的食品。公私合营稻香春土产食品店，连日来，每天有近万人来买应节食品。今年新添的南糖、奶油葡萄干、黑芝麻松仁元宵和蜜饯果脯等各种食品，销售额比平常增加一倍以上。
