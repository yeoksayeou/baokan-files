Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 23rd: The National Paddy Field Farm Implement Symposium was held in Hangzhou today.

　　This symposium is being held in the context of the widespread promotion of new farm implements this year after the great development of the national agricultural cooperativization movement. The main purpose of the symposium is to study and resolve the technical issues related to the widespread use of new farm implements such as the two-wheeled double-shared plow in rice-growing areas. On-site comparative tests of the two-wheeled double-shared plows and improved paddy field plows modified by various provinces will be conducted in various paddy fields in Jinhua, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, etc., to exchange experience in modification and use, and to determine the two-wheeled double-shared plow and improved paddy field plow styles with the best modification effects, so as to unify specifications and promote them universally. The symposium will also study the technical issues related to the widespread use of new farm implements such as rice threshers, cultivators, and harvesters in rice-growing areas in the future, as well as the semi-mechanization and mechanization of paddy field farming.

　　This symposium is sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture. The participants in the symposium include representatives of agricultural departments from 16 rice-growing provinces across the country; engineers and technical cadres from industrial departments of 11 provinces; farm implement experts from agricultural science research institutes in East China, South China, Central South, and Southwest China; and teachers from agricultural colleges in Beijing, Nanjing, Fujian, Guangxi, Zhejiang, and other places. Representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the First and Third Ministries of Machine Building Industry, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and other units also participated.

　　Today, the representatives participating in the symposium visited the exhibition of new paddy field farm implements such as two-wheeled double-shared plows modified by various provinces.

    全国水田农具座谈会在杭州举行
    将研究和解决在水稻区使用新式农具的技术问题
    新华社杭州23日电　全国水田农具座谈会今天在杭州举行。
    这次座谈会是在全国农业合作化运动大发展以后今年普遍推广新式农具的情况下举行的。座谈会的主要目的是要研究和解决在水稻区普遍使用双轮双铧犁等新式农具的有关技术问题，将在金华、温州、嘉兴等地各种不同的水田中，进行各省改装的双轮双铧犁和改良水田犁的实地比较试验，交流改装和使用的经验，确定改装后效果最好的双轮双铧犁和改良水田犁式样，以便统一规格，普遍推广。座谈会还将研究今后水稻区普遍使用打稻机、中耕器、收割机等新式农具有关的技术问题，以及水田耕作半机械化和机械化的问题。
    这次座谈会是农业部主持召开的。参加座谈会的有全国稻区16个省的农业厅代表；11个省的工业厅工程师、技术干部；华东、华南、中南、西南等农业科学研究所的农具专家；北京、南京、福建、广西、浙江等地农学院的教师。农业部和第一、第三机械工业部、中华全国供销合作总社等单位也派代表参加。
    今天，参加座谈会的代表们参观了各省改装的双轮双铧犁等水田新式农具的展览。
