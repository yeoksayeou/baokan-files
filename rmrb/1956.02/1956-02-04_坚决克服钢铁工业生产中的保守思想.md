Resolutely Overcome Conservative Thinking in Steel Industry Production
Liu Yuankang, Liu Qingyun

In recent years, the production of enterprises under the Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has greatly improved. If we take the 1952 output value as 100, then 1955 was 200.35, an average annual increase of 25.28%. Some major technical and economic indicators, such as the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, have approached the level of the Soviet Union in 1952. However, judging from the completion of steel production plans over the years, the potential of enterprises has not been fully utilized. In 1955, the losses caused by substandard quality and other accidents in some major products accounted for a large proportion of the annual production plan, of which pig iron reached 2.96%, open-hearth steel reached 1.7%, converter steel reached 0.9%, and ordinary steel reached 1.4%.

This is mainly because some units have conservative thinking when making plans, always hoping that the indicators issued by the higher authorities are as low as possible; after the indicators are determined, they are satisfied with meeting the control figures issued by the higher authorities.

Some units lack in-depth understanding of their own production situation, have no clear idea, and are always afraid that the plan will be too high to complete. For example, the Longyan Iron Mine did not grasp the iron content of the ore. When making the 1955 plan, it repeatedly requested that the iron content of the ore be set at 47.5%, but the actual iron content of the ore produced throughout the year reached more than 50%. As a result, it overfulfilled the pig iron production plan without much effort. Another example is the coking oven silica brick production cycle of Benxi Iron and Steel Company in 1955. The initial plan of the Steel Industry Administration Bureau was 672 hours, but the company thought it was too short and repeatedly requested to change it to 720 hours, but the actual time only required 557 hours, which was 115 hours less than the figure originally proposed by the Steel Industry Administration Bureau.

When making plans, some enterprises fail to see the favorable conditions and positive factors in production, and often accommodate the backward side, and even when making some major technical and economic indicators, they are groundlessly behind the level that has actually been achieved. For example, the actual open-hearth furnace heat repair rate of Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant in the second quarter of 1955 had reached 8.64%, but when they compiled the plan for the third quarter, they still set the heat repair rate at 9.86%. If calculated according to the level already reached in the second quarter, then the entire open-hearth furnace of the factory can stop production for 30 hours in the third quarter and still complete the plan. Shanghai Xinhu Steel Plant had already added a 400-horsepower motor to the small rolling mill at the end of 1954, but they did not incorporate the factor that the production capacity would definitely increase after adding equipment into the 1955 plan, and as a result, they completed the steel production plan one month ahead of schedule. The technical and economic indicators of open-hearth furnaces in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant are relatively backward among the open-hearth furnaces of the enterprises under the Steel Industry Administration Bureau. The Steel Industry Administration Bureau accommodated this backward side when compiling the annual plan. As a result, although the production of open-hearth furnace steel in this plant did not complete the plan for 5 months, the annual plan was still completed ahead of schedule.

In order to pursue "balanced production," some enterprises often lay ambushes when the monthly or quarterly plans have been completed, relax the finishing and inspection work of products, and do not put them into storage in time, so that when there is a shortfall in production next month or next quarter, they can be used to make up for the task. Last October, Tianjin Steel Plant was able to complete the production plan of open-hearth furnace steel by using 199 tons of steel ingots that had not been put into storage before to make up for it.

The weekly and daily work plans of enterprises should be formulated based on the actual production situation under the principle of ensuring the completion of the monthly plan. Some units become complacent when they estimate that there is no problem in completing the plan, and relax the compilation of weekly and daily work plans and the specific inspection of production. This will fail to fully utilize the potential of the enterprise, and sometimes it will make the plan that could have been completed fall through. For example, after the steelmaking workshop of Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant completed the annual plan ahead of schedule in 1955, some people violated the operating procedures, and the leaders of the workshop did not check; when defective products appeared, they did not investigate the reasons. As a result, the quality indicators of this workshop in November were not completed.

Some factories and mines are not active enough in promoting advanced experiences. The advanced experience of mechanical forming of refractory materials can not only improve labor productivity, but also improve the quality of refractory materials. However, in 1955, the proportion of mechanical forming of refractory materials in Benxi Iron and Steel Company declined quarter by quarter, and most of the forming machinery was left unused. Only four of the seven brick presses were used. The forming machinery of Fushun Steel Plant was only used on unimportant refractory products, and was not used when manufacturing important products (such as casting bricks and steel ladle lining bricks); several brick presses were also idle. Shandong Refractory Materials Factory was afraid of surplus labor after the implementation of mechanical forming, and delayed its implementation. Another example is that after steel plants in Shanghai, Tianjin and other places promoted the advanced experience of thick coal seam operation of Soviet gas furnaces, they improved the gas quality and reduced coal consumption, creating favorable conditions for carrying out rapid steelmaking and reducing steel costs. However, the gas furnace foreman of the open-hearth furnace workshop of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant believed that this experience was not as good as the experience of his own factory, and refused to promote it, and the leaders of the workshop did not criticize him. As a result, this workshop has long had the shortcoming of poor gas quality. Although some units recognize the significance of promoting advanced experiences, they become "complacent" after achieving some achievements and no longer promote them. This is how Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant treated the advanced experience of blast furnace humidified blast in 1955.

There is also conservative thinking in expanding varieties. When the Steel Industry Administration Bureau and many enterprises formulate production plans for new varieties, they always emphasize difficulties and are unwilling to increase the types of trial production of new products. For example, in 1955, the Steel Industry Administration Bureau planned to trial-produce 36 kinds of ordinary steel, but only one unit, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, successfully trial-produced 5 kinds in one quarter, accounting for 13.89% of the new product trial production projects of ordinary steel in the entire bureau. On the issue of expanding production varieties, some enterprises are unwilling to accept orders for new products. For example, after Tangshan Steel Plant successfully trial-produced high-aluminum stopper bricks in 1955, four units requested to order them from the factory. The factory initially refused to accept orders, and finally only accepted orders from one unit, and only signed agreements, not contracts.

From the above examples, it can be seen that the conservative thinking of steel industry production enterprises is quite serious. In order to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, it is necessary to conscientiously overcome these conservative ideas, vigorously learn and promote various advanced experiences, and give full play to the enthusiasm of all employees, engineers and technicians.

    坚决克服钢铁工业生产中的保守思想
    刘瀹康　刘清云
    几年以来，重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业的生产有了很大提高。如以1952年的产值为100，则1955年为200.35，平均每年增长25.28％ 。一些主要技术经济指标，如高炉和平炉的利用系数已经接近苏联1952年的水平。但是，从历年来钢铁生产计划完成的情况看，企业中的潜力还没有充分发挥。1955年一些主要产品因质量不合格和其他事故所造成的损失占全年产量计划的比重很大，其中生铁达2.96％，平炉钢达1.7％，转炉钢达0.9％，普通钢材达1.4％。
    这主要是由于有些单位在订计划的时候有保守思想，总希望上级颁发的指标越低越好；指标确定以后，就满足于凑足上级颁发的控制数字。
    有些单位对自己的生产情况缺乏深入的了解，心中无数，总怕计划订高了完不成。如龙烟铁矿没有掌握矿石含铁量，在订1955年计划的时候，就再三要求把矿石含铁量订为47.5％，但是实际全年所产矿石含铁量达50％以上，结果不经多大努力就超额完成了生铁生产计划。又如本溪钢铁公司1955年焦炉矽砖生产周期，钢铁工业管理局最初计划为672小时，公司却认为太短，再三要求改为720小时，但是实际只要557小时，较钢铁工业管理局原来提出的数字还少115小时。
    有些企业在订计划的时候，看不到生产中的有利条件和积极因素，往往迁就落后的一面，甚至在订一些主要技术经济指标的时候，竟毫无根据地落后于实际已经达到的水平。如重庆第一钢铁厂1955年第二季度平炉热修率实际已经达8.64％，而他们在编制第三季度计划的时候，还把热修率订为9.86％。如果按第二季度已经达到的水平计算，那末第三季度全厂平炉全部停止生产30小时还可以完成计划。上海新沪钢铁厂已经在1954年底在小型轧钢机上增加了一只400匹马力的马达，但是他们没有把增添设备后生产能力一定会提高的因素订入1955年计划，结果提前一个月完成了钢材生产计划。太原钢铁厂平炉技术经济指标在钢铁工业管理局所属企业同类型平炉中是比较落后的，钢铁工业管理局在编制年度计划的时候迁就了这落后的一面，结果这个厂平炉钢的生产虽然有5个月没有完成计划，而年度计划仍然提前完成了。
    有些企业为了追求“生产均衡”，往往在月计划或季计划已经完成的时候打埋伏，放松了产品的精理和检验工作，也不及时入库，以便下月或下个季度生产有亏欠的时候，用来弥补任务。去年10月，天津钢厂能完成平炉钢的生产计划，就是用以前没入库的199吨钢锭来弥补的。
    企业的周和日的作业计划，应该在保证完成月计划的原则下，根据生产的实际情况来制定。有些单位估计完成计划没问题的时候，就产生自满情绪，放松对周、日作业计划的编制和对生产的具体检查。这样就不能充分发挥企业的潜力，有时候还会使本来可以完成的计划落空。如重庆第一钢铁厂炼钢车间1955年提前完成了全年计划以后，有人违反操作规程，车间领导同志不去检查；出了废品，也不追究原因。结果，这个车间11月份的质量指标没有完成。
    某些厂矿对推广先进经验是不够积极的。耐火材料机械成型的先进经验，不仅可以提高劳动生产率，而且可以提高耐火材料的质量。但是1955年本溪钢铁公司耐火材料机械成型比重逐季下降，大部分成型机械停置未用，七台压砖机只用了四台。抚顺钢厂的成型机械只用在不重要的耐火制品上，制造重要产品（如浇注砖和盛钢桶衬砖）的时候都没有使用；压砖机也有几台闲置未用。山东耐火材料厂怕推行机械成型后劳动力过剩，而迟迟不推行。又如上海、天津等钢厂推广苏联煤气炉厚煤层操作法的先进经验以后，提高了煤气质量，降低煤耗，为开展快速炼钢，降低钢的成本创造有利的条件。而太原钢铁厂平炉车间煤气炉工长竟认为这个经验还不如自己厂的经验好，一直不肯推广，车间领导上也不给予批评。结果这个车间就长期有煤气质量不好的缺点。有些单位虽然认识了推广先进经验的意义，但是取得了一点成就以后就“安于现状”，不再推广了。石景山钢铁厂1955年对待高炉加湿鼓风的先进经验就是这样的。
    在扩大品种方面也有保守思想。钢铁工业管理局和许多企业制定新品种生产计划的时候，总是强调困难，不愿增加新产品试制的种类。如1955年钢铁工业管理局计划试制36种普通钢材，结果仅上海第三钢厂一个单位在一个季度内就试制成功了5种，占全局普通钢材新产品试制项目的13.89％。在扩大生产品种问题上，有些企业不愿接受新产品的订货。如唐山钢厂1955年试制高铝塞头砖成功后，曾有四个单位向该厂提出订货要求。这个厂起初都不接受订货，最后只接受一个单位的订货，而且只订协议，不订合同。
    从上面的一些事例可以看出：钢铁工业生产企业的保守思想是相当严重的。为了提前完成五年计划，必须认真地克服这些保守思想，大力学习和推广各种先进经验，发挥全体职工、工程技术人员的积极性。
