Prince Sihanouk's Speech at Guangzhou Airport

Ladies and Gentlemen:

    I am very excited and honored to set foot for the first time on the land of your country—a powerful and deeply friendly neighbor.

    Guangzhou is a famous metropolis in Asia, and entering this gateway this time is like entering a new realm.

    I am visiting your country with great sincerity, wanting to investigate and exchange opinions on various national construction plans, and especially willing to discuss various national construction issues with Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders in a frank manner.

    I met Premier Zhou Enlai in Bandung, and he impressed me as a capable, shrewd, and righteous great statesman, as well as a kind friend.

    Your country's politicians must be very clear about our country's situation and the position we have adopted.

    Our country abides by the agreements signed at the Geneva Conference, which were signed by our country willingly and voluntarily. Our country does not participate in any bloc, but adopts a neutral attitude. At the same time, our country is willing to establish economic and cultural ties with any country in the world that loves peace as much as our country does.

    Historically, our country and your country have a long and cordial friendship. This visit to your country is to renew the deep friendship of the past.

    A long time ago, your country's people came to our country to do business or conduct political investigations. After returning home, they wrote books to introduce Cambodia to people from all over the world, and some of your country's people settled in our country. Therefore, until today, there are very few people in our country who are not related to your country's people by blood.

    Our country is very sincere in wanting to establish unbreakable friendship with Asian countries. Your country has always been friendly to our country, treating us with courtesy as always, even after the Geneva Conference. Therefore, my visit to your country is precisely for this reason.

    I am sincerely and infinitely grateful for Premier Zhou Enlai's invitation to visit, as well as the grand welcome arranged by the leaders and people of your country.

    I hope that this friendly visit will bring mutual understanding, peace, and friendship to Asian countries. This is the wish of myself representing the people of our country.

    西哈努克亲王在广州机场上的讲话各位先生，各位女士：
    当本人第一次踏到  贵国——一个强大的、有深厚友谊的邻国的土地时，心情非常兴奋，而且觉得很荣幸。
    广州是一个闻名亚洲的大都市，这次本人踏进这个门户，正如开始踏入一个新的境地。
    本人非常诚意地来贵国访问，是想考察以及交换各种有关建国计划的意见，特别愿以坦诚的态度和周恩来总理及各首长讨论各种有关建国的问题。
    在万隆时，本人经与周恩来总理结识，他给我的印象，是一位能干、精明、富有正义感的伟大的政治家，同时也是一位善良的友人。
    贵国政治家一定很明了敝国的情形和所采取的立场。
    敝国遵守日内瓦会议所签定的协议，这一协议是由敝国欣然自愿签署的。敝国并没有参加任何一个集团，而是采取一种中立的态度。同时，敝国愿与世界上任何一个和敝国同样爱好和平的国家，建立经济和文化的联系。
    在历史上敝国与贵国是具有深长和敦睦的友谊，这次本人来到贵国访问正是重续从前深长的友谊。
    很久以前，贵国人民来敝国经商，或作政治考察，回国后著书介绍高棉与世界各国人士认识，同时一部分贵国人民在敝国成家立业。因此，直至今天，敝国人民与贵国人民，在血统上甚少没有关系的。
    敝国愿非常诚意地与亚洲各国建立牢不可破的友谊。贵国与敝国素来友好，一向以礼相待，及至日内瓦会议后，也仍和以前一般。所以此次本人来访问贵国，也正是为了这个意思。
    本人对这次周恩来总理的邀请访问以及各首长及贵国人民所安排的盛大欢迎，衷心无限地感激。
    希望这次友谊访问，会带来对亚洲各国互相谅解，和平友好，此点是本人代表敝国人民的愿望。（附图片）
