At the end of last year, many agricultural cooperatives in Daxing District, Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, wanted to buy double-wheeled double-furrow plows. However, Hou Jiacai, the district party secretary, criticized this as a “blind” action, arguing that these cooperatives had too few households and did not have the "conditions" to buy double-wheeled double-furrow plows. He even demanded that those agricultural cooperatives with fewer households return the double-wheeled double-furrow plows they had already bought. The county originally planned to promote 415 double-wheeled double-furrow plows in this district, but as a result of Secretary Hou's opposition to "blindness," only 49 were promoted.

Do cooperatives with fewer households not have the "conditions" to buy double-wheeled double-furrow plows? In Qiyu Township in the same district where Secretary Hou is located, there is a Luwei cooperative. When the cooperative had very few households, it already used all step plows and double-wheeled double-furrow plows for plowing, resulting in increased production in the cooperative. Many agricultural cooperatives saw this fact and universally requested to buy double-wheeled double-furrow plows; however, Secretary Hou seemed to have closed his eyes to these facts. Who is truly "blind"? Isn't it clear?

    是谁盲目
    去年年底，江苏省宿迁县大兴区有不少农业合作社要买双轮双铧犁，但是区委书记侯家才批评这是“盲目”行动，理由是这些社户数少，根本没有买双轮双铧犁的“条件”。并且要那些户数较少的农业合作社把已经买来的双轮双铧犁退回去。县里原来计划在这个区推广双轮双铧犁415张，由于侯书记反对“盲目”的结果，只推广了49张。
    户数少的社就没有“条件”买双轮双铧犁吗？就在侯书记所在的这个区的启禹乡有一个芦圩社，当社里户数还很少的时候，已经全部使用步犁和双轮双铧犁耕地，结果社里增加了生产。很多农业合作社正是看到了这一事实，才普遍要求买双轮双铧犁；但是侯书记仿佛在这些事实面前闭起了眼睛。究竟是谁“盲目”呢？难道还不明白吗？
