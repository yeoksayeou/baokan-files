Xinhua News Agency, Paris, dispatch from TASS: The French National Assembly on February 1, by a vote of 420 to 71 (with 83 abstentions), approved the policy program and cabinet members of the new French government formed by Socialist Guy Mollet. The French Communist Party voted in favor.

	Mollet stated in the meeting when explaining the policy program that it is necessary to reform the national system in order to ensure "the stability of executive power" and to revise the electoral system.

	Mollet said that he will strive to restore peace in Algeria, stop terrorism and suppression, and intends to implement a policy of negotiation in Morocco and Tunisia.

	When stating the foreign policy program, Mollet expressed support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At the same time, he advocated negotiations with the Soviet Union and said that the French government will work with its allies to seek new ways and means to bring Eastern and Western viewpoints closer.

	When Mollet talked about domestic affairs, he promised to take measures such as not allowing currency devaluation, opposing "social injustice," and revising the tax system.

	During the discussion, Jacques Duclos, chairman of the Communist parliamentary group, said, "The Communist Party is willing to do everything possible to organize a government supported by the left-wing majority of the National Assembly." Currently, all reactionary parties are concentrating their efforts to oppose the organization of a Popular Front government. In order to thwart this tactic, left-wing parties must unite and be sure to fulfill their campaign promises.

	Duclos said that the most pressing issue at present is the Algerian issue. There is only one way to solve this problem—negotiate with the authorized representatives of the Algerian people. The Communist Party will strive to recognize the national aspirations of the Algerian people.

	Duclos condemned the plans to piece together blocs in Europe, and he pointed out that in order to improve relations between East and West, it is necessary to sign a European collective security treaty. He approved of Mollet giving priority to the issue of disarmament in his policy program, because in the current situation it is difficult to resolve the German question.

	Duclos finally said that although the Mollet government does not meet the wishes of the masses, the Communist Party voted to authorize Mollet to form a cabinet, deeply believing that public pressure will soon tip the scales to the left.

    法国国民议会赞成由摩勒组成的新政府
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎讯　法国国民议会1日以420票对71票（83票弃权）表示赞同社会党人摩勒所组成的法国新政府的施政纲领和内阁成员。法国共产党投赞成票。
    摩勒在会上说明施政纲领说，必须改革国家制度以便保证“行政权的稳定性”，并且还要修改选举制度。
    摩勒说，他将力求恢复阿尔及利亚的和平，停止恐怖和镇压，并且打算在摩洛哥和突尼斯实施谈判政策。
    摩勒在申述外交政策纲领时表示支持北大西洋组织。同时，他主张同苏联谈判，并且说，法国政府将协同它的盟国一起寻求使东西方观点接近的新途径和办法。
    摩勒谈到内政问题时答应将采取不允许货币贬值、反对“社会的不公平现象”和修改税收制度等措施。
    共产党议会党团主席杜克洛在讨论时发言说，“共产党愿意尽一切力量来组织一个由国民议会的左翼多数所支持的政府”。目前各反动党派集中一切力量来反对组织人民阵线政府。为了锉败这种策略，左翼政党必须团结起来，务必履行它们的竞选诺言。
    杜克洛说，目前最迫切的问题是阿尔及利亚问题。解决这个问题只有一个办法——同阿尔及利亚人民授权的代表谈判。共产党将竭力争取承认阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望。
    杜克洛谴责在欧洲拼凑集团的计划，他指出，为了改善东西方之间的关系，签订欧洲集体安全条约是必要的。他赞成摩勒在他的施政纲领中给予裁军问题以优先地位，因为在目前情况下解决德国问题是困难的。
    杜克洛最后说，虽然摩勒政府并不符合广大群众的愿望，但是共产党投票赞成授权摩勒组阁，深信公众压力将很快地使天平向左倾。
