    Tianjin Steel Plant's workers fulfilled their inter-factory competition guarantee conditions in January. They comprehensively completed the January production plan. With the same manpower and equipment, they produced 8.5% more steel ingots and 44% more steel products than in January of last year.
    From the first day of this year, this plant launched a socialist competition to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. During steelmaking, steelworkers would allocate some people to repair the furnace and select materials for the next furnace before the previous furnace of molten steel was completely discharged. This cross-working method shortened the steelmaking time. 32% of the total number of steelmaking furnaces in January reached the rapid steelmaking standard. In January, the plant's workers also created 8 new records in terms of output and furnace repair. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    天津钢厂一月份实现竞赛条件
    天津钢厂的职工1月份实现了他们的厂际竞赛保证条件。他们全面地完成了1月份生产计划。在同样的人力和设备条件下，比去年1月份多生产了8.5％的钢锭和44％的钢材。
    这个厂从今年的第一天起就开展了五年计划四年完成的社会主义竞赛。炼钢的时候，炼钢工人不等前一炉钢水流完，就分出一部分人来补炉和为下一炉钢进行选料。这种交叉工作的方法缩短了炼钢的时间。在1月份的炼钢总炉数中有32％达到快速炼钢标准。1月份内，这个厂的职工在产量方面和修炉方面还创造了8项新纪录。（据新华社讯）
