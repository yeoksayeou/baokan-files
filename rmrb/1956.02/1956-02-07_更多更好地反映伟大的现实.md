    More and Better Reflection of the Great Reality
    By Our Correspondent Su Lan
    In the past few days, the literary and art committee members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have been particularly active. They are discussing a common issue: In the great march of socialism, how should writers and artists arrange their work and life? How to quickly express the enthusiasm and colorful life and struggle of socialism in the unique form of literature and art? How to better educate the people with the weapon of literature and art?
    Du Pengcheng, the author of "Defend Yan'an," said excitedly at this meeting: "Looking back at the road we have traveled and looking at the era we are in today, we feel both excited and have a great responsibility."
    Du Pengcheng came from the snow-capped Qinling Mountains. The Qinling Mountains have already had four snowfalls. The writer told me: When the gale blows, the worker's shed shakes like a sieve. But, compared to the workers, what does this count for? The workers have to move the high mountains in the freezing weather and dig through the big rivers in the sewage and mud. The workers are truly creating miracles. The workers' labor gives the writer the impetus to create and educates the author himself. Du Pengcheng repeatedly emphasized: "As a writer, only by being educated in life first can one educate others. We have no reason not to contribute all our strength." He lived with the workers building the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and is prepared to go to Sanmenxia with this construction army after the project is completed. He said: "Living, working, and creating among the working masses is my long-term policy."
    Since the publication of "Defend Yan'an," Du Pengcheng has received more than a thousand letters, which are an encouragement to the writer. Now, he is starting to write a novel reflecting the railway construction in our country. This transformation, from depicting the combat life of soldiers to reflecting the creative labor of the working masses, is not easy, but Du Pengcheng said confidently: "It depends on whether you have a tenacious spirit and are willing to pay more arduous labor."
    Yes, thousands of writers are thinking and doing this way. We will not forget that the transition from criticizing Hu Feng's reactionary literary and artistic ideology to launching the struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique began on the cultural front. In this struggle, literary and art workers received profound education and further clarified their understanding of the Party spirit of literature. On this basis, when the upsurge of the socialist revolution came, they quickly plunged into the vigorous struggle. In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed throughout the country. This is such a thrilling thing. Artists will not stand outside the trend. Film director Zhang Junxiang said at a panel discussion: "We cannot imagine that after three years, we are still walking with square steps and lagging far behind the masses. We are unwilling to provide such material for cartoonists." He enthusiastically suggested to the meeting that literary and art workers quickly set out personal plans and start competitions. He said: "Each of us should strive for the honor of running at the forefront of the competition."
    Zhang Junxiang came to this meeting with new achievements. In the 50 days before the meeting, he had already completed the production of the large-scale documentary "Spring Festival Gala." Now, he is preparing to spend half a year creating a script with the theme of ideological transformation of engineering and technical personnel. He said: This meeting will enrich his creation. The development of China's film industry is very rapid. This year, China's first historical biography film "Song Jingshi," the first film reflecting the heroic struggle of the navy "Light Cavalry on the Angry Sea," as well as excellent films such as "Dong Cunrui" and "Mysterious Companion," will meet the audience. Hearing the news that "Thousands of Waters and Thousands of Mountains" is also going to be put on the screen, I visited Lan Ma. He came to participate in this meeting as a specially invited member. He told reporters that in order to strive to still play the role of Li Youguo, he insisted on physical exercise every day. He said: "In any case, I have to lose some weight to make myself more in line with the requirements of the role in appearance." Lan Ma's success in creating the image of Li Youguo has given him new achievements in performing arts. He often said: "Participating in the performance of 'Thousands of Waters and Thousands of Mountains' is the most important page in my acting history." However, he was not satisfied with these achievements. When he participated in this meeting, he had many feelings in his heart. He said: "As an artistic director, my more important task in the future is to teach my art to our successors."
    In Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report, it was said: "Our drama art, under the policy of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new,' after a short period of reorganization, has recently won universal and high reputation in performances in Asian and European countries." These words encourage dramatists to make greater efforts.
    China's classical art is so rich and colorful. As long as we make efforts to reorganize and improve it, it will emit a more brilliant brilliance. The old painter Fu Baoshi once talked to me about the many characteristics of Chinese painting. He said: "The generality of Chinese painting, the high performance of highlighting the theme, and the unique style are all highly appreciated by the people of all countries." However, in the past, this kind of rich art was not seriously studied and reorganized. Recently, many Chinese painters have begun to express new themes—creating historical stories and heroic characters—which is a very valuable transformation. Fu Baoshi's "Forcibly Crossing the Dadu River," "Crossing the Snowy Mountains," and Qu Yuan's "Nine Songs" have all achieved certain successes. Now, new requirements are placed in front of artists. Fu Baoshi enthusiastically called on the Chinese painting circle: "Speed up the reorganization and research of existing national heritage, and let us also set off a climax of art creation!"
    "Accelerating the speed and setting off a climax of cultural construction" is already urgent. At this meeting, the excited feelings of writers and artists are hard to express. The Inner Mongolian poet Na. Sayin Chaoketu said with great emotion: "If you don't catch up again, you will lag behind the times!" He described the changes that have taken place in Inner Mongolia: from Daqing Mountain to Xing'an Mountains, people always like to use words such as desert, wind and snow, and "the wind blows the grass low to see cattle and sheep" to describe this area. Today, everything is changing. In the blue sky of the grassland, blue smoke wafts from the factory chimneys; in the Mongolian yurt, the songs broadcast by the radio are heard. Inner Mongolia has a rich literary heritage, and oral literature has been passed down from generation to generation. Na. Sayin Chaoketu said: "Now we have all the conditions for developing national literature and art. For the first time in the history of Inner Mongolia, we have our own literary and artistic publication—'Inner Mongolia Literature and Art'. We should work harder to reflect these changes in the people."
    Also at this meeting, Xu Shaoqing, an old actor from Xiang Opera, expressed the heartfelt words of the old artists in the drama industry. He said excitedly: "In the old society, we were all poor children who came to learn opera. Today, we have risen from the eighteenth level of hell to the highest heaven. This is the happiness and glory given to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In the tide of this great era, our drama workers must enrich our repertoire and strive to improve our artistic level. We must contribute all our strength and be worthy of the glorious title of intellectuals in the new China!"
    Indeed, earth-shaking changes have stirred up waves of excitement and joy in the hearts of writers and artists. Engineers of the human soul, the times are calling you, and the people are expecting you. They demand that you quickly create brilliant and rich works of art to reflect this great era.

    更多更好地反映伟大的现实
    本报记者　苏蓝
    这几天，政治协商会议的文艺界委员们显得特别活跃。他们在讨论着一个共同的问题：在社会主义大进军中，作家、艺术家怎样安排自己的工作和生活？如何迅速地以文学艺术的特有形式表现社会主义的热情而多采的生活和斗争？如何以文艺武器更好地去教育人民？
    “保卫延安”的作者杜鹏程在这次会议上曾激动地说：“回忆一下我们走过的道路，再看看今天所处的时代，就觉得既兴奋而又责任重大。”
    杜鹏程来自白雪皑皑的秦岭山峰。秦岭，已经落了四次雪。作家对我说：当狂风刮起的时候，住的工棚好像筛子一样地摇晃。但，比起工人来，这又算得了什么？工人们在冰天雪地中要把高山移走，在污水泥泞中要把大河挖通，工人们才真正创造着奇迹。工人的劳动，给予了作家创作的动力，教育着作者本人。杜鹏程一再强调说：“作为一个作家，只有自己首先在生活中受到教育，才能去教育别人。我们没有理由不贡献出自己所有的力量。”他和建设宝成铁路的工人们生活在一起，而且准备工程竣工后随着这支建设大军开往三门峡。他说：“在工人群众中生活、工作和创作，这是我的长期方针。”
    自从“保卫延安”出版后，杜鹏程连续接到了一千多件来信，这些来信，对作家是一支鼓舞力量。现在，他正着手创作一部反映我国铁道建设的小说，从描写战士的战斗生活到反映工人群众的创造性劳动，这一转变是不容易的，但杜鹏程自信地说：“这要看自己有没有顽强的精神，肯不肯付出更艰巨的劳动。”
    是的，千百个作家都在这样想、这样做。我们不会忘记，从批判胡风的反动的文艺思想转到展开肃清胡风反革命集团的斗争，是从文化战线上开始的。在这次斗争中，文艺工作者受到了深刻的教育，进一步明确认识了文学的党性。在这个基础上，当社会主义革命高潮来临的时候，他们很快地投入了蓬蓬勃勃的斗争。大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成，这是多么动人心弦的事情。艺术家们是不会站在潮流之外的。电影导演张骏祥在小组会上说：“不能想像到了三年后，我们还迈着四方步子，远远地落在群众的后面。我们不愿意为漫画家提供这样的题材”。他热情地向会议建议：文艺工作者赶快订出个人规划，并且展开竞赛。他说：“我们每一个人都应该争取在竞赛中跑在最前面的荣誉。”
    张骏祥是带着新的成就来参加这次会议的。就在会前的50天中，他已经完成了大型纪录片“春节大联欢”的摄制工作。现在，他又准备花上半年的时间，创作以工程技术人员思想改造为主题的脚本。他说：这次会议将会丰富他的创作。我国电影事业的发展是很快的。在这一年，我国第一部历史传记片“宋景诗”、第一部反映海军英勇斗争的“怒海轻骑”以及“董存瑞”“神秘的旅伴”等优秀影片，都要和观众见面了。听到“万水千山”也要搬上银幕的消息，我去访问了蓝马。他是作为特邀委员来参加这次会议的。他告诉记者，为了争取仍然扮演李有国这个角色，他每天在坚持着体育活动。他说：“不管怎样，要把身体练瘦些，使自己在外形上更符合角色的要求”。蓝马创造李有国形象的成功，使他在表演艺术上获得新的成就。他常说：“参加‘万水千山’的演出，是我演剧历史上最重要的一页。”但是，他并没有满足这些成就。当他参加这次会议时，内心有很多感触。他说：“作为一个艺术指导来说，我今后更重要的任务是把自己的艺术教给我们的接班人。”
    在郭沫若副主席的报告中这样说：“我们的戏剧艺术，在‘百花齐放，推陈出新’的方针之下，经过短时期的整理，最近在亚洲和欧洲各国的演出都获得了普遍崇高的声誉”。这些话，鼓励着戏剧家们作出更大的努力。
    我国的古典艺术是那么丰富多采，只要我们再努力加以整理提高，它就会发出更灿烂的光辉。老画家傅抱石曾经向我谈到中国画的许多特点，他说：“国画的概括性、突出表现主题的高度性能以及独特的风格，都是各国人民所十分赞赏的。”但是，过去对这么一种丰富的艺术却没有加以认真的研究和整理。最近以来，许多国画家已经开始表现新的主题——创造历史故事和英雄人物，这是十分可贵的转变。傅抱石创作的“强度大渡河”“过雪山”以及屈原的“九歌”都获得了一定的成功。现在，新的要求摆在美术家的面前。傅抱石在热情地向国画界呼吁：“加紧整理和研究已有的民族遗产，让我们也掀起美术创作的高潮！”
    “加快速度，掀起文化建设高潮”已经是迫不及待。在这次会议上，作家、艺术家激动的心情是难以尽述的，内蒙古诗人纳·赛音朝克图十分感慨地说：“再不赶上去，就要落在时代的后面了！”他在叙述内蒙古发生的变化：由大清山到兴安岭，人们总喜欢以沙漠、风雪，“风吹草低见牛羊”等字句来形容这个地带。今天，一切都在变。在草原的碧空，飘动着工厂烟囱冒出的青烟；在蒙古包中，传出了收音机放送的歌声。内蒙古有着丰富的文学遗产，口头文学一代相传一代。纳·赛音朝克图说：“如今我们有了发展民族文学艺术的一切条件，在内蒙古历史上第一次出现了自己的文艺刊物——‘内蒙古文艺’。我们应该更努力地来反映人民中的这些变化。”
    也就是在这次会议上，湘剧老演员徐绍清道出了戏剧界老艺人的心头话。他激动地说：“在旧社会，我们都是穷孩子来学戏，今天，我们从十八层地狱升上了天上天。这是共产党、毛主席给予我们的幸福和光荣。在这大时代的浪潮中，我们戏剧工作者要丰富自己的剧目，努力提高艺术水平，我们要贡献出自己的一切力量，要无愧于新中国知识分子这个光荣的称号！”
    的确是这样，翻天复地的变革，已经在作家和艺术家的心中激起了兴奋和欣悦的浪花。人类灵魂的工程师，时代在向你们召唤，人民在期待着你们。要求你们迅速地创作出灿烂、丰富的艺术作品，来反映这个伟大的时代。
