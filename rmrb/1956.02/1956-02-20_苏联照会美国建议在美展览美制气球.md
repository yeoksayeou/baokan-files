Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th: Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko received U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bohlen on February 18th and handed him a note from the Soviet government in response to the U.S. government's note to the Soviet Union on February 8th. The U.S. note was a response to the Soviet government's note to the U.S. government on February 4th regarding the issue of U.S. military agencies releasing balloons from U.S. air bases in West Germany and some countries bordering the Soviet Union into Soviet airspace.

    In its reply, the U.S. government admitted that the U.S. had released a number of balloons around the world. However, the reply insisted that the purpose of the balloons released by the U.S. was for meteorological observation and the collection of scientific intelligence, and that these balloons would not pose a danger to civil aviation. The reply also stated that in order to avoid misunderstandings and in view of the Soviet government's objections, the U.S. government would endeavor to avoid releasing balloons that, according to known information, might cross into Soviet territory. At the same time, the reply denied any involvement by the U.S. government in measures to send propaganda balloons to the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet government's note to the U.S. government on February 18th stated that the U.S. government, in its reply, did not deny that U.S. balloons had entered Soviet airspace, but argued that the balloons' flight posed no danger to air traffic. This argument cannot justify the violation of airspace. Therefore, the Soviet government reiterated that releasing such balloons into Soviet airspace was a gross violation of the inviolability of Soviet territory and a violation of recognized principles of international law, and expressed its protest against such incidents.

    The Soviet note then refuted the U.S. justification for its balloon releases. The note stated that the numerous materials now in the possession of the Soviet government, as well as the statements made by many other European governments on this issue, prove that the flight of U.S. balloons seriously threatens air transport and the residents of the areas over which the balloons fly. Soviet experts have studied the equipment attached to the balloons and determined that the release of these balloons into Soviet airspace has nothing to do with meteorological observation. The true purpose of the U.S. military agencies in releasing these balloons into Soviet airspace is to conduct aerial photography of Soviet territory.

    The Soviet note said that since the views expressed in the U.S. note are inconsistent with the conclusions drawn from the irrefutable materials in the possession of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government suggests holding an exhibition in New York, Washington, or in places such as London or Paris, to display the balloons intercepted in the Soviet Union and the devices attached to them, provided that the governments of the countries concerned agree to hold such an exhibition. If it is necessary to prove that the Soviet government's claims are well-founded, the Soviet government is also prepared to hold such an exhibition in other countries with the consent of the governments of those countries.

    The Soviet note concluded by saying that the Soviet government noted the U.S. government's statement that the U.S. government will take measures to ensure that balloons that may fly into Soviet airspace are not released in the future.

    苏联照会美国建议在美展览美制气球
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯在2月18日接见了美国驻苏联大使波伦，交给他苏联政府的一份照会，答复美国政府2月8日给苏联的照会。美国这个照会是答复苏联政府在2月4日就美国军事机构从西德领土以及同苏联接壤的一些国家的领土上的美国空军基地向苏联领空放出气球的问题给美国政府的照会。
    美国政府在复照里承认美国已经在世界各地放出了若干气球。但是，复照硬说，美国放出的气球的目的是为了观测—气象、搜集科学情报，这种气球对民用航空不会构成危险。复照又说，为了避免误解，并且鉴于苏联政府的反对，美国政府将设法避免再放出根据已知的材料可能越入苏联国境的气球。同时，复照里否认美国政府参加向苏联放送宣传气球的任何措施。
    苏联政府2月18日给美国政府的照会里说，美国政府在复照中不否认有美国气球放入苏联领空一事，但是却说气球的飞行对航空交通是没有危险的，这种论据不能为侵犯领空一事辩解。为此，苏联政府再次指出向苏联领空放出这种气球是粗暴地侵犯苏联领土的不可侵犯性和破坏公认的国际法准则，并且对这种情事表示抗议。
    苏联照会接着驳斥了美国为其放出气球行为辩护的说法。照会说，苏联政府现在掌握的许多材料以及其他许多欧洲国家政府就这一问题发表的声明证明，美国气球的飞行严重地威胁空中运输和气球飞过的地区的居民。苏联专家研究了挂在气球上的设备之后并且断定，把这些气球放进苏联领空同气象观测毫不相干，美国军事机关把这些气球放进苏联领空的真正目的是对苏联领土进行空中摄影。
    苏联照会说，既然美国照会所表达的观点与根据苏联所掌握的无可置辩的材料得出的结论不一样，苏联政府建议在纽约、华盛顿，或者是譬如在伦敦、巴黎这样的地方举行展览会，展出在苏联所截获的气球和挂在气球上的装置，只要有关国家的政府同意举行这种展览会。如果有必要证实苏联政府的说法是有根据的，苏联政府还准备在其他一些国家的政府同意下，在这些国家举行这种展览会。
    苏联照会最后说，苏联政府注意到美国政府声明说，美国政府方面将采取措施使得今后不许放出可能飞到苏联领空的气球。
