Xinhua News Agency, February 18th. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged cadre meeting of industrial enterprises today to discuss further promoting socialist competition in Beijing's factories and mines.

The city's state-owned and locally-owned factories and mines overfulfilled the January state plan by 7.3%, an increase of 34.7% compared to the same period last year. To date, more than 100 factories and mines citywide have proposed to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, with more than 20 units individually or jointly issuing proposals to launch socialist competition with the same industry and same type of work nationwide.

Jia Tingsan, Minister of Industry of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, used many examples at the meeting to illustrate the high socialist enthusiasm of the workers in various factories and mines. He said that after the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant mobilized the masses to further develop the competition, some blast furnaces exceeded the 1957 production level by 3.5% as early as January 27. The state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory received more than 300 letters of proposal, determination, and guarantee from its employees in two days. The Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant's plan to produce universal milling machines this year, after research by the leadership and workers, has been increased by more than two times compared to last year. The leading cadres of the Beijing Electrical Machinery Plant originally had no confidence in the plan to compress the working hour quota by 20%, but after workers' discussion, it was compressed by 41%.

Jia Tingsan said that the most important problem now is that the leadership is lagging behind the masses. The leading cadres of various factories and mines must break through conservative thinking, take immediate action, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and lead this movement. He asked the leading cadres of various factories and mines to seize positive factors, overcome backward factors, strengthen the leadership of the work of promoting advanced experiences and rationalization proposals, hold advanced producer meetings universally, and carry out lively propaganda and mobilization work to make this mass movement a powerful force for completing the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, February 18th. The fourth meeting of the Second Committee of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, held on the 18th, reviewed the leadership work of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions in 1955, and decided that this year it would lead the socialist competition to a new upsurge to welcome the convening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

The meeting approved the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions' work plan for 1956. The central task stipulated in this plan is to organize the city's workers to strive for the comprehensive advance and over-fulfillment of the country's first Five-Year Plan. The plan requires trade union organizations to mobilize workers to widely carry out advanced producer movements, organize factories and mines citywide to respond to the proposals of factories and mines in Beijing and across the country to carry out competition in the same industry and the same type of work, and vigorously promote advanced experiences and strengthen the work of rationalization proposals in the socialist competition. Trade union organizations should cooperate with the administration to formulate specific plans for promoting advanced experiences, universally run advanced experience schools, organize technical mutual assistance between workers and between workers and engineering technical personnel, and conduct mass inspections of rationalization proposals through forms such as rationalization proposal representative meetings. Trade union organizations at all levels must resolutely support rationalization proposals from the masses of workers and fight against bureaucrats who treat rationalization proposals with bureaucracy. The plan also stipulates the need to strengthen collective contracts, team-based economic accounting systems, safety technical measures, propaganda, literacy campaigns, labor insurance, cultural and sports activities, and trade union work in joint state-private enterprises in factories and mines.

    北京各厂矿企业
    社会主义竞赛热烈展开
    据新华社18日讯　中共北京市委员会今天召开工业企业扩大干部会议，讨论进一步开展北京各厂矿企业中的社会主义竞赛问题。
    北京市全市国营、地方国营厂矿企业超额7.3％完成了1月份国家计划，比去年同期增长了34.7％。到目前为止，全市已经有100多个厂矿企业的职工提出要提前完成第一个五年计划，其中有20多个单位单独或联合向全国发出开展同产业、同工种社会主义竞赛的倡议。
    中共北京市委员会工业部部长贾庭三在会上用许多事例说明各厂矿企业职工的社会主义积极性很高。他说，石景山钢铁厂在发动群众进一步开展竞赛以后，有的高炉在1月27日就超过了1957年生产水平的3.5％。国营北京第一棉纺织厂在两天中收到了300多件职工的倡议书、决心书和保证书。北京第一机床厂今年生产万能铣床的计划，经过领导方面和工人研究以后，比去年增加了两倍以上。北京市电机厂的领导干部原来对压缩工时定额20％的计划没有信心，经过工人讨论，结果压缩了41％。
    贾庭三说，现在最重要的问题是领导落后于群众。各厂矿企业的领导干部要打破保守思想，立即行动起来，发动群众依靠群众，领导这个运动。他要求各厂矿企业的领导干部要抓住积极因素，克服落后因素，加强对推广先进经验和合理化建议工作的领导，普遍召开先进生产者会议，开展生动活泼的宣传鼓动工作，使这个群众性的运动成为提前完成第一个五年计划的强大力量。
    据新华社18日讯　18日举行的北京市工会联合会第二届委员会第四次会议，检查了北京市工会联合会1955年的领导工作，并且决定今年要把社会主义竞赛引向新的高涨，迎接中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的召开。
    会议通过了北京市工会联合会1956年的工作计划。这个计划规定的中心任务是组织全市职工争取全面地提前和超额完成国家的第一个五年计划。计划要求工会组织发动职工广泛开展先进生产者运动，组织全市厂矿企业响应北京和全国各地厂矿企业开展同产业、同工种竞赛的倡议，并且在社会主义竞赛中大力推广先进经验和加强合理化建议的工作。工会组织要协同行政制定推广先进经验的具体计划，普遍举办先进经验学校，组织工人和工人间、工程技术人员和工人间的技术互助，采用合理化建议代表会议等形式对合理化建议工作进行群众性的检查。各级工会组织必须坚决支持职工群众中的合理化建议，并且同对待合理化建议的官僚主义者作斗争。这个计划还规定了要加强厂矿企业中的集体合同、班组经济核算制、安全技术措施、宣传、扫盲、劳动保险、文艺体育活动和公私合营企业中的工会工作等。
