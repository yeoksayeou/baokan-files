Comrades!

In his report, Comrade Khrushchev clearly, profoundly, and thoroughly reported on the work of our Party during the period summarized in the report, and the outstanding achievements it has made under the leadership of its Central Committee, and put forward the tasks of the Party in the struggle to achieve new victories for communism.

The achievements of the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are known to everyone. The Party Congress, our entire Party, and the entire Soviet people have made a comprehensive assessment of these achievements, and they have every reason to be proud of these achievements and support them with great satisfaction. (Applause)

The Central Committee of our Party has victoriously completed the great tasks it had to solve in the period between the 19th and 20th Party Congresses; it has implemented the correct, truly Leninist general line of the Party both in internal affairs and in foreign affairs. (Applause)

Lenin taught that the Party's policies can succeed when the Party takes into account the demands of the times and when it sensitively listens to the voice of life. If we look at the period summarized in the report from this point of view, then it can be said that the Party, under the leadership of its Central Committee, has been particularly close to life and close to the people in these years. It has shown particular foresight in assessing the domestic and international situation, it has correctly grasped the opportunity, and it has shown a creative attitude in solving economic and political problems.

The summary report of the Central Committee fully reflects this creative and militant spirit shown by the Party in the work it has done since the 19th Congress, and fully reflects the Central Committee's greatest enthusiasm and initiative in mobilizing the entire Party and the Soviet people to realize the Party's political line. (Applause)

The report summarizes the brilliant achievements of our country and the people's democratic countries in building socialism, and summarizes the achievements of the progressive forces of the world in striving to ease international tensions, striving for national independence and democratic rights for all peoples, and striving for lasting peace and universal security. The working people of our country and the progressive people of the world will find in the figures and facts cited in the report, and in the theoretical principles and political conclusions developed in the report, a new source of belief in the inevitable victory of the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

At the same time, the summary report of the Central Committee fully followed the Leninist tradition, and it did not hide from the Party and the people the existing shortcomings and weaknesses in our work and the unresolved tasks. This shows that our Party is not satisfied with achievements, and it has put forward new and grand tasks. Critically assessing the work done is an immutable condition of Bolshevik leadership. Only in this way can we avoid stagnation in our work and ensure that we constantly strive towards new, better, and more advanced things. This is what the great Lenin taught us.

He once said: "The whole problem is not to be satisfied with the skills we have gained from our past experience, but to move forward, to gain more, and to move from easier tasks to more difficult tasks. Otherwise, there can be no progress at all, and there can be no progress in socialist construction." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 28, p. 172)

The Struggle for Lasting Peace and the Struggle for Socialism

Comrades! The profound understanding of the characteristics of the current international situation and the tasks facing the progressive forces of all mankind determines the great enthusiasm shown by our Party in the field of the diplomatic policy of the Soviet state in the period mentioned in the report. In recent years, the Soviet Union has expressed its opinions on every important international issue that concerns the people of all countries in the world, and the Soviet Union has made great contributions to solving such issues.

In this regard, the Party's position is an active and leading one, and it strives to concretely solve various issues related to the fate of the world in practice. Thanks to the active peace policy of the Soviet Union and the joint actions of all peace-loving countries, great progress has been made in solving many problems. On other issues, the Soviet Union's proposals are the most realistic and constructive today, and if these issues have not been resolved by now, it is not our fault.

We have implemented the diplomatic policy of the Soviet state formulated by our Party with a high degree of principle and at the same time with extreme flexibility. On the one hand, the Soviet Union resolutely combats the attempts of certain countries to dictate to other countries, and at the same time expresses its willingness to reach agreements on the basis of mutual consideration of each other's interests.

The active struggle of the Soviet Union and other peace forces has achieved two important results. First, for the first time in many years, there has been some degree of relaxation in international tensions. The mere fact that there is no place in the world where war is being waged now shows how much progress has been made in the international situation. Second, the positions of peace, democracy, and socialism have been greatly strengthened. The international prestige and influence of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp have been greatly enhanced. At the same time, the positions of the imperialist camp have been greatly weakened. Even someone like former US Secretary of State Mr. Acheson had to admit this. According to the "Washington Post and Times Herald," Acheson said not long ago, "If we look around, we find it difficult to find a place where what has happened in the past few years has not made the situation unfavorable to us."

Recently, the friendly relations and cooperation between the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries in Asia have expanded, thus consolidating the cause of peace even more. The peace forces within capitalist countries have also grown stronger. For example, the recent election results in France can prove this. The left-wing parties in France have greatly expanded and strengthened their positions among the people and in the parliament.

Of course, it would be wrong to be satisfied with the achievements already made. Much more needs to be done to turn the easing of international tensions that has already occurred into lasting peace. The struggle of the people of all countries for peace can and must be raised to a new stage, especially because some people in the West are trying to resume the "Cold War."

As for the Soviet Union, it still adheres to the policy of peaceful coexistence between the socialist system and the capitalist system put forward by Lenin, and is unremittingly fighting for further easing international tensions and consolidating peace, because this is completely in line with the interests of the people of all nationalities in our country and the interests of socialism.

Judging from the domestic situation and the fundamental issues of international situation development discussed by the Congress, we can see more clearly the historical significance of our struggle today. The Congress has made us more deeply aware of the direction in which things are developing in our era, in the era of great changes in the lives of people in many countries, in the era of the collapse of the imperialist system and the establishment of the socialist world system.

The principled issues raised by Comrade Khrushchev in his report regarding the development of the current international situation, such as the issue of peaceful coexistence between the two systems, the possibility of preventing war in our era, the issue of the forms of transition to socialism in various countries, and the issue of attitude towards social democratic parties, are of great significance.

Comrade Khrushchev's elucidation of these issues is a concrete example of creatively applying and developing the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Khrushchev analyzed the current international situation and the changes of world-historical significance that have taken place in the post-war period from a Marxist point of view, summarized the new experiences accumulated by our Party, the fraternal communist parties, and the entire international workers' movement, and on this basis he gave convincing answers to the most pressing issues that concern the people of all countries. (Applause)

As Comrade Khrushchev explained, in the current historical situation, the question of the inevitability of war should be formulated in a new way, different from the way this question was formulated before the First and Second World Wars. Now, the balance of power on the world stage has undergone fundamental changes, in favor of the defenders of peace and unfavorable to the warmongers. Of course, since imperialism still exists, the economic basis for the outbreak of war still exists, and the danger of the most reactionary monopoly capital groups launching military adventures, especially military adventures against socialist countries, has not been eliminated. Therefore, any indifference in this regard and any relaxation of attention to further strengthening national defense forces are not permissible. But now, war is not destined to be inevitable. Now, under the new historical conditions, there is a powerful force that possesses important means to prevent the imperialists from launching a war. If the imperialists still attempt to launch a war, then defeat the aggressors and bury the capitalist system forever along with the war--the social system that not only subjects the vast majority of the working people to cruel exploitation, deprives them of their rights, and causes them to suffer from poverty and hunger, but also periodically drags them into horrific bloody wars. (Prolonged applause)

The ruling groups of imperialism cannot but consider these new historical conditions. At the same time, military aggression certainly cannot be prevented spontaneously. Only by resolutely fighting for peace, that is, only when all peace forces unite, actively prevent the danger of war and aggression, heighten vigilance against the instigators of war, promptly expose their conspiracies, and keep the people of all countries in a state of mobilization and preparedness can military aggression be prevented.

This understanding that modern war is not destined to be inevitable will undoubtedly help to further expand the ranks of peace advocates and will further encourage all peace fighters.

The principle of different ways of transition to socialism in various countries developed in Comrade Khrushchev's report has equally important significance.

Changes of world historical significance in the international situation now not only create more favorable conditions for the struggle for lasting peace, but also create more favorable conditions for the struggle for socialism and for the transition to socialism in non-socialist countries, and at the same time help to adopt different ways to achieve this transition in different countries.

The historical experience of the emergence and development of the socialist system that has now been established in many countries fully confirms Lenin's brilliant prediction: As long as the basic and main aspects are consistent and common in moving towards socialism, the transition to socialism in various countries will not be exactly the same. The democracy, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the speed of socialist transformation in all aspects of social life in each country have their own characteristics.

This experience proves that to ensure the transition to socialism, the working class, under the leadership of its vanguard, needs to establish political leadership over the state. Recognizing this basic and decisive condition for the transition to socialism is the main difference between revolutionary Marxists and reformists. It is necessary to establish the political leadership of the working class over the state because it is necessary to deprive the capitalist class of the ownership of the means of production and transfer this information to the ownership of society in the short or long term according to specific conditions, to resist all possible attempts at restoration from the overthrown exploiting classes, and to organize socialist construction.

Life also proves that in each socialist country, in the case of consistency in the basic and main aspects, and in the case of fraternal exchange of experience and mutual assistance, especially the experience and assistance of the Soviet Union, there have appeared diverse creative forms both in the decisive participation of the working class in state power and in socialist construction.

The question will certainly arise: What about the future? Is it possible to have new forms of transition to socialism? This question is of paramount importance. The desire of the people of all countries to move towards socialism is irresistible, and the attractiveness of socialist ideas is growing. As socialism achieves further achievements in our country, China, and all people's democratic countries, this attraction will become even stronger. In this case, the advanced people of many countries will not fail to consider what path their people will take to transition to socialism.

Comrade Khrushchev gave a completely correct Marxist answer to this extremely important question. It is entirely possible that the transition to socialism in capitalist countries will show greater particularity in the future, and there will be more and more new forms of transition to socialism, which will reflect both some common and more favorable conditions in the current historical environment, and the specific characteristics of each of these countries.

At the same time, it is incorrect to think that in any case, the transition to socialism will inevitably be linked to civil war. In many respects, this depends on the balance of power at home and on the international stage, depends on the degree of organization and awareness of the various revolutionary classes, and is related to the resistance of the reactionary classes. When the Russian proletariat led its own domestic revolution, it faced a united front of imperialist countries. Now, the progressive forces of other countries have a more favorable prospect in this sense. New conditions also exist in the capitalist countries themselves. The central issues of political struggle in these countries are such issues as defending peace, democratic freedom, and national independence. In this case, it is entirely possible for the working class and its party to unite the vast majority of the people—peasants, petty bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and even patriotic people in the bourgeoisie—around them under a unified democratic program. There is no doubt that this will help create conditions for the victory of the working class.

However, even in this case, in many capitalist countries where reactionary forces and military police machines are particularly powerful, the transition to socialism will cause crazy resistance from the exploiting classes, so the revolutionary struggle of the working class will inevitably be fierce. At the same time, in some other capitalist countries where reactionary forces and military police machines are relatively less powerful, the possibility of a peaceful revolution during the transition to socialism is not ruled out. For example, it is not impossible for the working class to peacefully seize power by occupying a majority in parliament and making the parliament truly a parliament of the people. This parliament, relying on the mass revolutionary movement of the proletariat, the working peasants, the intellectuals, and all progressive people, will be able to smash the resistance of the reactionary forces and carry out socialist social reforms.

The enemies of communism portray communists as people who consistently advocate armed uprisings, violence, and civil war under any circumstances. This is an absurd slander against communists and the working class they represent. Of course, communists and the working class hope to transition from one social system to another in the way that causes the least pain. However, as Comrade Khrushchev said here, the form of this transition depends on the specific historical conditions, and whether to adopt a more peaceful or more violent method does not depend on the working class, but depends on the degree and form of resistance of the overthrown exploiting classes who are unwilling to voluntarily give up their huge property, power, and other privileges.

The report of the Central Committee stated the principled attitude of our Party towards the issue of social democratic parties at the present stage.

There is no doubt that in the case where the people of all countries should unite all forces to jointly oppose the threat of a new war, the division of the international workers' movement is even more intolerable. Life has raised some major issues that give us points of contact with social democrats, that is, make it possible for us to conduct transactional contact, approach, and cooperation with them on these issues. This possibility arises primarily because, in the current situation, the primary task facing the workers' movement is to defend peace, national freedom, and democracy. In many capitalist countries, the working masses strongly tend to the left. The vast majority of ordinary members of socialist parties, Christian trade unions, and other organizations support peace.

It can be predicted that the idea of unity will be increasingly embraced by the various parts of the working class and will lead to practical results. However, this will not arise spontaneously, and it will depend to a large extent on us communists, on our initiative in this regard.

The significance of the theoretical principles formulated by the summary report of the Central Committee on urgent international issues cannot be overestimated. There is no doubt that these principles will have significant significance for the unity of all progressive forces, and can provide help to all advanced forces that are striving for lasting peace, and for advanced new social systems that can free the people of all countries from exploitation, war, and all forms of social and national oppression, to replace the already decaying capitalist system. (Stormy applause)

Raise the Party's Organizational Work to the Level of Adapting to New Tasks

Comrades! During the period summarized, the Party solved the problems of internal development with the same enthusiasm and initiative. The basis of this enthusiasm is that the Party clearly saw the urgent needs for further development of the country.

The Party boldly exposed the shortcomings in economic, political, and party affairs activities. The Party formulated a broad program for rapidly improving agriculture and improving industrial work at several plenary sessions of the Central Committee. The Party called on the working people to make new efforts to reorganize the work of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, as well as the work of industrial enterprises, and carried out huge organizational work. It can be boldly said that the major economic measures that our Party is now implementing in our country are unprecedented since industrialization and collectivization. In two years, we were able to increase the sown area in the country by more than 30 million hectares, which is equal to the total sown area of several European countries. This shows that our Party is now capable of undertaking the most important tasks.

The huge work carried out by the Party has yielded results. In agriculture, we have taken a big step forward in increasing the production of grain, industrial raw material crops, and developing animal husbandry, and have created conditions to greatly increase the production of agricultural products in the coming years to meet the growing needs of the country. In industry, the fact that the five-year plan was completed in four years and four months also shows how huge the potential is in this sector of our national economy.

We can now put forward new and huge tasks on the basis of the achievements already made. We can now not only rapidly develop heavy industry, which is the foundation of the entire national economy, but also rapidly develop the production of consumer goods, greatly increase social wealth, and on this basis vigorously improve the welfare of the broad masses of the people. These tasks are put forward in the draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan submitted to the Congress. The implementation of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will mean new and huge achievements in the socialist economy, and will mean that our country has taken another big step forward in the production of abundant consumer goods and in the construction of communism.

Comrades! The Soviet people will welcome the measures stipulated by the Central Committee of the Party regarding further improving the living conditions of the Soviet people in the Sixth Five-Year Plan with extremely jubilant mood and a new upsurge of labor. Comrade Khrushchev talked about the content of these measures: during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, transitioning to a 7-hour working day for all workers and staff members, a 6-hour working day for workers in important industries in the coal and mining industries working underground without reducing wages, shortening working days on Saturdays and holidays by two hours soon, increasing the wages of workers and staff members with lower salaries, reorganizing the pension system, drastically expanding the construction of housing (twice that of the Fifth Five-Year Plan), and improving the work of canteens and other living welfare institutions. All these measures will raise the welfare of the Soviet people to a new level. The Party cares about everyone, cares about the working people, cares about the youth - our hopes and future, cares about the old fighters on the labor front, cares about women and children, cares about everyone, this is what should be in a socialist society.

These proposed measures have aroused widespread reactions abroad. All honest people feel happy with us. But there are also some people who do not feel happy about these measures. The publication of the new five-year plan of the Soviet Union aroused dissatisfaction among certain groups. These groups have no doubt that the five-year plan of the Soviet Union will definitely be completed. Now, everyone admits this. What these groups are afraid of is something else. US Supreme Court Justice Douglas recently publicly talked about this in an article. He said: "If Russia can win peace, even ten years of peace, it can greatly improve the living standards of its country. In this way, it can give a huge impact on Asia and Europe... A smiling, peaceful, and prosperous Russia is the most difficult international problem."

Mr. Douglas is clearly uneasy about the peaceful economic competition between the two social systems, but we do not intend to comfort him. It should only be pointed out that a peaceful and prosperous Russia is by no means a "difficult international problem" for the ordinary working people of the world. The ordinary working people justly believe that the achievements of the Soviet working people are the victory of the great cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. (Prolonged applause)

The Sixth Five-Year Plan is an important stage in the peaceful economic competition between the two systems. The characteristic of this stage is that the Soviet state currently possesses all the necessary conditions to solve the main economic task of the Soviet Union in the shortest historical period - to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita production.

To this end, we must ensure that our entire national economy transitions to a new and higher technical level and greatly increase labor productivity. At present, this is the main thing to ensure the victory of socialism in the competition with capitalism. Therefore, the economic issues of production have never had such significance.

Economic leadership and the work of various departments, leaders of enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms should be raised to a new level.

In this case, special requirements are also put forward for the work of Party organizations.

Our Party is more united and unified at the time of the convening of the 20th Congress than ever before. The Party's correct political line, its infinite power to work for the interests of the working people, unites the entire Soviet people more closely around the Party than ever before, and further strengthens the alliance between the working class and the peasants and the great and unbreakable friendship of the people of all nationalities in our country.

The ideological and organizational unity of the Party is the basic condition of its strength and steadfastness, and is the source of all its victories. It is by relying on the unity of its ranks that the Communist Party has successfully solved the problems of domestic and foreign policy and led the construction of the economy and culture.

The strengthening of the Party's unity and the improvement of its enthusiasm, initiative, and combat effectiveness are to a large extent due to the restoration of the norms of Party life and the principles of Party leadership formulated by Lenin, which were often violated before the Party's 19th Congress.

The theory and practice of personality cult, which did not conform to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and were very common before the 19th Congress of the Party, brought great harm to the Party's organizational and ideological work. They narrowed the role of the masses of the people and the Party, weakened collective leadership, undermined intra-Party democracy, suppressed the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of Party members, created laissez-faire, irresponsibility, and even caused arbitrariness in the work of certain people, hindered the development of criticism and self-criticism, produced one-sidedness, and often led to wrong solutions to problems.

Restoring Lenin's principle of collective leadership means restoring the foundation of the Party's construction. In fact, our Party is equal to a living organization with originality. The Party's organizational collective leadership, election system and work report system, as well as criticism and self-criticism, are important conditions for promoting initiative, discovering errors and shortcomings in work, seeking ways to eliminate errors and shortcomings, and giving play to the enthusiasm of Communist Party members.

The principle of collective leadership is currently being successfully restored in institutions at all levels from the Central Committee to grassroots organizations. The increasingly developed criticism and self-criticism, as well as the truly collective discussion and resolution of problems by Party organs at all levels, are proof of this. It can be said without the slightest doubt that the principle of collective leadership has been fully restored in the Central Committee. The decision of all major issues rests with the regularly convened plenary sessions of the Central Committee, the center of this broad collective activity of the Party, which is most closely linked to the decisive part of the work of building a communist society. The collective experience of the Central Committee based on Marxism-Leninism ensures the correct leadership of the Party and the state, and ensures the unshakable unity of the Party's ranks. (Applause)

We must strive to completely overcome the harmful theory and practice of personality cult and strictly implement the principle of collective leadership in the work of all Party organizations. Every Party worker should thoroughly understand the significance of the principle of collective leadership - this is the unity of the Party, the formulation of correct policies, and the victorious implementation of these policies. It is the most important condition for correctly cultivating cadres and making the entire Party's work have a new upsurge.

The Party's unity, organization, and combat effectiveness depend to a great extent on its members.

The Party does not accept all those who express their willingness to join the Party. It accepts the most advanced and most active people, and it adjusts the recruitment work according to the tasks faced in a certain stage of activity. During the period of industrialization and agricultural collectivization, the main people admitted to the Party were workers and peasants. During the war years, the main people admitted to the Party were those on the front line. It is unnecessary to add more proof that at present, when solving the task of drastically increasing the production of material wealth, it is reasonable to first focus on recruiting the direct producers of these welfare - workers and collective farm members. (Applause)

What is the situation of the Party's work in recruiting Party members? It must be pointed out that in the past two years, the proportion of workers and collective farm members among those admitted to the Party has increased compared with previous years.

However, in many Party organizations, the proportion of workers and collective farm members among the new Party members admitted is very small. It is often the case that many Party organizations have almost the same conditions, but the proportion of workers and collective farm members admitted to the Party by some of them is much lower than that of other organizations. The Sverdlovsk Oblast and the Novosibirsk Oblast are two almost equally developed industrial areas. However, the proportion of workers in the Party members admitted by the Sverdlovsk Oblast Party organization in 1955 accounted for 47.2%, while Novosibirsk Oblast only accounted for 32.2%. Collective farm members accounted for 31.7% of the Party members admitted in Omsk Oblast, while only 11.4% in Stalingrad Oblast. Why does Novosibirsk Oblast admit fewer workers to the Party than Sverdlovsk Oblast, and Stalingrad Oblast admit fewer collective farm members to the Party than Omsk Oblast? This is nothing more than because the Party organizations in Novosibirsk Oblast and Stalingrad Oblast are not concerned about the issue of recruiting Party members. Unfortunately, other Party organizations also have this situation.

It should be remembered that the success of the work is greatly related to the composition of the Party members in the Party organization. The Party organization should raise requirements in adjusting the work of recruiting new Party members, and vigorously increase the proportion of workers and collective farm members among the new Party members admitted.

The significance of organizational work is great. It is unnecessary to talk more about that the success of the cause and the victorious resolution of the major economic tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan depend first and foremost on organizational work. Therefore, the issue of resolutely raising the level of leadership, especially the level of district leadership, is very acute.

In his report, Comrade Khrushchev exposed many serious shortcomings in the working methods of the Party's local leading institutions, such as loving to talk empty words, bureaucracy, not studying economic leadership in depth, not being good at organizing people to eliminate shortcomings and overcome difficulties, and promoting the experience and scientific achievements of advanced workers and innovators in industry and agriculture.

Since the Central Committee required resolutely correcting the bureaucratic leadership method that is high above, there have been some improvements in the work of the local state committees, border area committees, city committees, and district committees of the Party. Various meetings have been reduced, Party workers have begun to go to enterprises, collective farms, and state farms more frequently, and have worked to help improve local work more. However, very little work has been done in this regard. Unfortunately, there are still many Party organizations that are still busy with meetings and paperwork instead of being busy with organizational work among the masses. These things waste the main time and energy of the workers as before. It is not difficult to guess what results this style of work will produce. People are constantly holding meetings and writing official documents, but the work has not progressed. Comrade Ignatinko, Secretary of the Maihov District Committee of the Vitebsk Oblast of Belarus, said at the last meeting of the state Party Committee: "For 10 years, our district and some other districts have been criticized as backward districts. During this period, the district Party Committee Secretary in the district has been replaced 19 times, and the Chairman of the District Executive Committee has been replaced 6 times. Now, there are 9 committees in the district to investigate and study the situation, but the district is still backward as in the past. The state Party Committee and the state Executive Committee have not actually solved the specific problem of how to help our district."

The bad habit of bureaucracy is very prevalent in the grassroots Party organizations, which is often promoted by the District Party Committee, which requires "lengthy" meeting minutes, various reports and materials, and so on. As a result, the most concerned thing for the secretaries of some grassroots Party organizations is not to work on people, but to work on paper, which consumes all his main time.

The work of Comrade Rustamov, Secretary of the Party organization of the Kirov Collective Farm in the Shamkhor District of the Azerbaijan Republic, is an example of this. His desk and bookshelves are piled with bundles of official document folders and notebooks. He has to register the work of the Party group, the work of women, the work of young Party members, help the Communist Youth League organizations, various applications and complaints, instructions to Party members, Party education, and the work of amateur drama groups, and so on. His folders read: "Wall Newspaper," "Battle Small Newspaper," "Livestock Work Competition," "Field Work Competition," "Friends of Afforestation." The work of the propagandist is recorded in 3 notebooks: "Propagandist Work Record," "Mass Political Work Record," "Propagandist Daily Task." Everyone can imagine how much time these things will inevitably make the secretary spend on the paperwork that is divorced from the lively organizational work. And there is not a little educational work for the milkers and animal husbandry workers of the collective farm. No mechanization is realized in the livestock feeding farms, there is no work schedule, and the amount of feed for each head of livestock is not specified. The productivity of livestock products is very low: each cow produces an average of only 484 liters of milk per year. However, the secretary's folders cannot squeeze out a little milk. In this regard, these folders will never give birth to calves. (Laughter, applause)

We must improve the work of Party institutions and thoroughly eliminate the bureaucratic method of work. The focus of Party organizations should be on mass work, quickly shifting to specific and expert leadership of economic construction work, and conscientiously organizing the work of publicizing and promoting advanced experience and scientific achievements in various enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms.

We must streamline the staffing of Party institutions so that it is composed of a small number of, but professionally proficient staff. The Central Committee streamlined its institutions by 25%. I think this is just the beginning of further streamlining. The state committee, the border area committee, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the union republic, and the city and district committees of the Party should follow the deployment and implement the streamlining of Party institutions. Doing so will only benefit their work.

Here, I want to say a few words about the work of the political departments of civil administration institutions. In places where political departments were established, the political departments once played a fairly active role, but now they show less performance and repeat the work of local Party organizations. Comrade Khrushchev rightly talked about the backwardness of technology in the railway transportation industry. Obviously, the staff of the railway political departments should also be responsible for this backwardness. If the issue of the backwardness of technology in railway transportation is not raised to them, then who should it be raised to? But have they expressed their opinions, have they spoken for technological progress? No. It seems that the issue of abolishing the political departments is completely ripe. (Applause)

Harmful Phenomenon of Ideological Work Being Divorced From Life Should Be Terminated

Comrades! Comrade Khrushchev comprehensively analyzed the ideological work of Party organizations in the report of the Central Committee. He pointed out that the main shortcoming now is that it is greatly divorced from life, not good at summarizing and publicizing typical examples of communist construction that have been tested by advanced life among the masses, and is not active enough in the struggle against the bad phenomena that hinder our progress. This is correct and fair criticism.

The Party believes that ideological work is an integral part of the entire work of communist construction. The main tasks of the Party's ideological work are: to provide practical help to building communism and improving labor productivity, to improve the socialist consciousness of the masses by all means, to carry out a resolute struggle against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, against bourgeois ideology and bourgeois morality, to arm the working people, especially the leading cadres, with Marxist-Leninist theory, and to creatively develop Marxist-Leninist theory.

However, our Party's ideological work has not done enough in solving all these major tasks, and to a large extent it is futile and turns into rote memorization of those well-known formulas and principles, often cultivating bookworms and dogmatists who are divorced from life.

The edge of our propaganda is largely aimed at the past and history, regardless of current issues. In addition, our way of teaching Party history cannot help historical experience to correctly understand today's issues. We have done a very bad job of publicizing economic knowledge and the work experience of advanced workers, engineers, collective farmers, advanced enterprises, collective farms, state farms, and work teams.

We have heard that millions of Communist Party members have been studying the erroneous views of the Populists, Economists, and Bundists for many years in the Party's education system, without studying how to fight against the remnants of capitalism in our own ideological consciousness and how to expose our current ideological enemies on the international stage, nor to study the domestic economic development, the experience of innovators, advanced enterprises and collective farms, and scientific achievements in order to most effectively manage the economy, improve labor productivity, increase the production of material data, and successfully solve other tasks of communist construction.

Many ordinary Communist Party members also recognize this abnormal situation. Comrade Ignatov, a harvester operator of the Mikhailov Machine Tractor Station in Stalingrad Oblast, spoke well about this. He said: "I have been studying Party history in the group for 13 years. The propagandist explained to us 13 times about the issue of the Bund. Is there nothing more important for us than criticizing the Bund? (Laughter) We are interested in the cause of our machine tractor station, district, and state. We want to live in the present and the future, but our propagandist is deeply mired in the events of the Populists and Bundists, and can no longer get out." (Laughter, applause)

It can be seen from this that the Party's propaganda work has begun to lose its Bolshevik fighting spirit.

Most of our propagandists know very little about the economic issues in production. Those who lead these propagandists and educate them are often people who do not understand production or only have the most general concept of production. What is the way out? The way out is: resolutely make our economic leaders, Party leaders, and Soviet leaders pay attention to propaganda work, especially the propaganda of economic knowledge.

We must raise the requirements for propagandists. Do not pursue the number of propagandists, but choose talented people who are truly good at linking our propaganda work with the actual tasks of economic and cultural construction.

At the same time, propagandists must be constantly working. It should be understood that if Party institutions do not lead them, do not guide them to recognize current tasks, do not help guide them, and do not arm them with specific materials and facts, then the best propagandists will also "wither" and "shrivel." The system of cultivating and training propagandists should be reformed so that they can acquire the necessary knowledge of industry and agriculture.

It is very regrettable that not only in our propaganda work there are shortcomings of being divorced from and lagging behind life and reality, but also in the theoretical front there are such shortcomings to a large extent.

For example, take economic science. At the present stage, studying the profound process of our socio-economic development should be the main and decisive direction in the work of studying and developing Marxist thought. This does not mean that attention should be relaxed to studying the past revolutionary experience of the Party or Marxist-Leninist philosophy. However, in the development of Soviet society, we have reached the stage where we should focus our main attention on studying and exploring economic science, because understanding the objective laws of socialist economic development can first use these laws to accelerate communist construction.

The publication of the textbook of political economy is a gratifying thing in this regard. However, just one textbook is not enough, and regrettably, important scientific works that creatively study economic phenomena are still too few.

Some economists have made serious mistakes in their works. The Party must correct those shoddy economists who advocate the anti-Marxist view of slowing down the development of heavy industry. Economists deny that the category of intangible depreciation of technical equipment still exists under the socialist system, causing very serious losses, which in fact creates a theoretical basis for conservatism and conservatism in the technical community.

Economists have not properly studied the role of the law of value in socialist production. Our architects are obsessed with redundant decorations and do not consider the people's kopecks. Machine tractor stations and collective farms often do not consider the cost of producing a ton of grain and meat. These situations are undoubtedly affected by the fact that economists have not properly studied how the law of value specifically plays a role in our economy.

The scientific work of studying the economic problems of specific sectors of the national economy is in a state of neglect. There are more than 40 scientific research institutions in the Soviet Union that should study the economics of agricultural production. However, they have done very little

### 苏斯洛夫在苏共第二十次代表大会上的发言

专栏：

    苏斯洛夫在苏共第二十次代表大会上的发言同志们！
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中清楚地、深刻地和详尽地报告了我们党在报告所总结的时期内的工作和它在自己的中央委员会的领导下所取得的杰出成就，并且提出了党在为取得共产主义的新的胜利的斗争中的任务。
    苏联共产党中央委员会的工作成绩是大家都知道的。党代表大会、我们全党以及全体苏联人民对这些成绩作了全面的估价，他们有充分的理由为这些成绩而自豪并且怀着极其满意的心情来拥护这些成绩。（掌声）
    我们党中央委员会胜利地完成了它在第十九次和第二十次党代表大会之间的时期内所要解决的巨大任务；无论是在内政方面或者是在外交方面它都执行着正确的、真正列宁式的党的总路线。（掌声）
    列宁教导说，当党考虑到时机的要求的时候、当党敏感地倾听生活的呼声的时候，党的政策就能够得到成功。如果从这一观点来看报告所总结的时期，那末可以说，党在它的中央委员会的领导下在这些年中是特别地接近生活、接近人民的，它在估计国内外局势的时候表现了特别有远见，它正确地把握住了时机，对解决经济问题和政治问题表现了创造性的态度。
    中央委员会的总结报告充分反映了党在第十九次代表大会以后所作的工作中所表现的这种创造的、战斗的精神，充分反映了我们中央委员会在善于动员全党和苏联人民实现党的政治路线方面所表现的最大的积极性和主动性。（掌声）
    报告中总结了我国和人民民主国家建设社会主义的辉煌成果，总结了全世界进步力量争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取各国人民的民族独立和民主权利、争取持久和平和普遍安全的成果。我国劳动人民和全世界进步人士在报告里所引用的数字和事实中、在报告里所发展的理论原则和政治结论中将找到对和平、民主和社会主义事业必胜的信念的新的源泉。
    和这同时，中央委员会的总结报告完全遵循了列宁主义的传统，它没有向党和人民隐瞒我们工作中现有的缺点和薄弱的环节以及没有解决的任务。这就说明，我们的党没有满足于成就，它提出了新的、宏伟的任务。批判地估价做过的工作，这是布尔什维克式领导的不可改变的条件。只有这样，才能避免在工作中停滞不前，才能保证不断地努力向新的、更好的、先进的事物迈进。这是伟大的列宁教导我们的。
    他曾经说：“整个问题在于，不要满足于我们从我们过去的经验中所获得的技能，而必须前进，必须获得更多的东西，必须从比较容易的任务走到更困难的任务。否则根本就不可能有任何进步，也就不可能在社会主义建设中取得进步。”（列宁全集第28卷第172页）
    争取持久和平和争取社会主义的斗争
    同志们！对当前国际形势发展的特点和全人类进步力量所面临的任务的深刻理解，决定了我们党在报告所谈到的时期内在苏维埃国家外交政策方面所表现的巨大积极性。这几年来，在全世界各国人民所关怀的重要国际问题上，没有一个问题苏联不表示自己的意见，对解决这样的问题苏联无不做出巨大的贡献。
    在这方面党的立场是一种积极的、领导力量的立场，它努力在实践中具体地设法解决和世界命运相关的各种问题。由于苏联积极的和平政策以及所有爱好和平的国家的共同行动，在解决许多问题方面取得了很大的进展。在其他问题上，苏联的建议今天是最现实的、最富有建设性的，如果这些问题到现在还没有解决，那么，这不是我们的过错。
    我们以高度的原则性，同时又极其灵活地执行了我们党所制定的苏维埃国家的外交政策。苏联一方面坚决打击某些国家对其他国家发号施令的种种企图，同时表示愿意在互相考虑彼此利益的基础上达成协议。
    苏联和其他和平力量的积极斗争获得了两个重要的成果。第一，多少年来国际紧张局势第一次有了某种程度的缓和。单单是现在世界上已经没有一个地方在进行战争这一点，就说明国际局势有了多大的进展。第二，和平、民主和社会主义力量的阵地大大地加强了。苏联和整个社会主义阵营的国际威信和影响大大地提高了。同时，帝国主义阵营的阵地大大地削弱了。甚至连前美国国务卿艾奇逊先生这样的人也不得不承认这一点，据“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”消息，艾奇逊不久以前说，“如果我们看一看周围，我们就很难找到一个地方在过去几年中所发生的事情不是使局势变得对我们不利的。”
    最近，苏联同亚洲爱好和平的国家的友好联系和合作扩大了，因而和平事业更加巩固了。资本主义国家内部的和平力量也壮大起来了。例如，最近法国的选举结果就可以证明这一点，法国的左翼党派大大地扩大了和加强了它们在人民群众中和议会中的阵地。
    当然，如果满足于已经取得的成就，那将是错误的。还得做很多的事情，才能使已经出现的国际紧张形势的缓和变成持久的和平。各国人民争取和平的斗争可以而且必须提高到新的阶段，特别是因为在西方有些人企图重新进行“冷战”。
    至于苏联，它仍旧遵循列宁所提出的社会主义制度同资本主义制度可以和平共处的方针，并且为进一步缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平而进行不懈的斗争，因为这是完全符合我国各族人民的利益和社会主义的利益的。
    就代表大会所讨论的国内情况和国际局势发展的根本问题看，我们就更加清楚地看出了我们今天的斗争的历史意义。代表大会使我们更加深刻地认识到，在我们的时代，在许多国家的人民的生活中发生伟大变革的时代，在帝国主义制度崩溃和社会主义世界体系建立的时代，事态是朝着哪一个方向发展的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中提出的关于目前国际局势发展中的原则性的问题，如两个制度的和平共处问题、在我们时代中防止战争的可能性、各个国家过渡到社会主义的形式问题以及对社会民主党的态度的问题，都是有重大意义的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中对这些问题的阐明是创造性地运用和发展马克思列宁主义伟大学说的一个具体的范例。赫鲁晓夫同志以马克思主义的观点分析了当前的国际形势和战后时期所发生的具有全世界历史意义的变化，总结了我们党、兄弟共产党和整个国际工人运动所积累的新的经验，在这个基础上他给了各国人民所关心的最切身的问题以令人信服的答复。（掌声）
    正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说明的，在当前的历史情况下，对战争不可避免性的问题应当有新的提法，和第一、第二两次世界大战前对这个问题的提法不同了。现在，世界舞台的力量对比起了根本的变化，有利于和平捍卫者，而不利于战争贩子。当然，由于帝国主义还存在，爆发战争的经济基础现在还存在，最反动的垄断资本集团发动军事冒险、特别是反对社会主义国家的军事冒险的危险还没有消除，因此，在这方面任何的漠不关心和对进一步加强国家防务力量注意的任何放松都是不容许的。但是，现在，战争并不是注定不可避免的。现在，在新的历史条件下，存在有一支强大的力量，他们拥有重要的手段足以防止帝国主义者发动战争，如果帝国主义者仍然企图发动战争，那么就击溃侵略者，把资本主义制度——不仅使占人口绝大多数的劳动人民遭到残酷的剥削、陷于无权地位和遭到贫穷饥饿的痛苦，而且周期性地把他们拖入骇人听闻的流血战争的社会制度——同战争一起永远地埋葬掉。（经久不息的掌声）
    帝国主义的统治集团也不能不考虑这些新的历史条件。同时，军事侵略当然是不能够自然而然被防止的。只有坚决争取和平，就是说只有一切和平力量团结一致、十分积极地防止战争和侵略的危险，对战争的挑拨者提高警惕性，及时地揭露他们的阴谋和使各国人民保持动员准备的状态，这样才能够防止军事侵略。
    对现代战争并不是注定不可避免的这种认识，无疑地将有助于进一步扩大和平拥护者的队伍，将更加鼓舞全体和平战士。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中所发展的关于各个国家过渡到社会主义有不同方式的原理，有同样重大的意义。
    国际局势中有世界历史意义的变化现在不但为争取持久和平的斗争创造了更加有利的条件，而且为争取社会主义的斗争、为非社会主义国家过渡到社会主义创造了更加有利的条件，同时有助于在不同国家中采取实现这种过渡的不同方式。
    现在已经在许多国家中建立起来的社会主义制度的产生和发展的历史经验，完全证实了列宁的天才预见：只要在基本上和主要方面是一致地和共同地走向社会主义，各国向社会主义的过渡是不会完全一样的，每个国家的民主、无产阶级专政、社会生活各方面的社会主义改造速度都各有其特点。
    这个经验证明，要保证过渡到社会主义，就需要工人阶级在它的先锋队的领导下对国家建立政治领导。承认过渡到社会主义的这个基本的和有决定意义的条件，就是革命的马克思主义者和改良主义者主要不同的地方。所以必须建立工人阶级对国家的政治领导，是因为要在或长或短的时期内根据具体条件剥夺资本家阶级的生产资料所有权，把这种资料转归社会所有，反击从已经被推翻的剥削阶级方面来的一切可能的复辟的企图，以及组织社会主义建设。
    生活同时证明，在每个社会主义国家中，在基本上和主要方面是一致的情况下，在兄弟般地交流经验和互助，特别是苏联的经验和援助的情况下，无论在工人阶级有决定意义地参加国家政权方面，或者是在社会主义建设方面，都出现了多种多样的创造性的形式。
    当然会产生这样一个问题：将来怎样呢？是不是可能有过渡到社会主义的新形式呢？这个问题是有头等重要意义的。各国人民走向社会主义的愿望是不可遏止的，社会主义思想的吸引力日益增长，随着社会主义在我国、中国和所有人民民主国家中获得进一步的成就，这种吸引力量更加强大了。在这种情况下，许多国家的先进人物不会不去考虑他们国家的人民将通过什么样的道路过渡到社会主义。
    赫鲁晓夫同志对这个极为重要的问题作了完全正确的马克思主义的回答。完全可能，资本主义国家中向社会主义的过渡今后将表现更大的特殊性，将会出现越来越新的过渡到社会主义的形式，这些形式既会反映出目前历史环境中一些共同的、更加有利的条件，也会反映出这些国家中每个国家的具体特点。
    同时，认为在任何情况下，过渡到社会主义同内战将是不可避免地联系在一起的这种说法是不正确的。在许多方面这要取决于国内以及国际舞台的力量对比，取决于各个革命阶级的组织性和觉悟的程度，并且同反动阶级的反抗力量有关。当俄国无产阶级领导自己国内的革命的时候，它面对着一个帝国主义国家的统一阵线。现在其他各国的进步力量在这个意义上说有着更加有利的前景。现在，在资本主义国家本身也存在着新的条件。这些国家中政治斗争的中心问题有这样一些问题：保卫和平、民主自由和民族独立。在这种情况下，工人阶级和它的政党完全有可能把绝大多数的人——农民、小资产阶级、知识分子、甚至资产阶级中具有爱国情绪的人士，在一个统一的民主的纲领下团结在自己的周围。毫无疑问，这将会有助于创造工人阶级胜利的条件。
    但是，就是在这种情况下，在许多反动势力和军事警察机器特别强大的资本主义国家里，向社会主义过渡将引起剥削阶级的疯狂反抗，因此工人阶级的革命斗争也必然是激烈的。同时在其他一些反动势力和军事警察机器比较不强大的资本主义国家里，在向社会主义过渡的时候，并不排除和平进行革命的可能性。例如，工人阶级通过在议会中占有多数而使议会真正成为人民的议会的方法和平地掌握政权并不是不可能的。这种议会依靠无产阶级、劳动农民、知识分子和所有进步的人民阶层的群众性革命运动，将能够粉碎反动势力的反抗和进行社会主义的社会改革。
    共产主义的敌人把共产党人说成是无论在任何条件下都始终如一地主张武装起义、暴力和内战的人。这是对共产党人和共产党人所代表的工人阶级的荒谬的诬蔑。共产党人和工人阶级当然希望用痛苦最少的方式从一个社会制度向另一社会制度过渡。但是，正如赫鲁晓夫同志在这里说过的，这种过渡的形式取决于具体的历史条件，采用比较和平或是比较强暴的方法不取决于工人阶级，而取决于不甘自愿放弃自己手中的庞大财产、政权和其他特权的正在被推翻的剥削阶级的反抗程度和形式。
    中央委员会的报告陈述了在现阶段我们党对待社会民主党问题的原则性的态度。
    毫无疑问，在各国人民应当团结一切力量共同反对新战争威胁的情况下，国际工人运动的分裂就加倍不可容忍了。生活提出了一些重大问题，使我们同社会民主党人有了接触点，也就是使我们可能就这些问题同他们进行事务性的接触、接近和合作。这种可能性首先产生于：在当前的情况下，工人运动面临的首要任务就是保卫和平、民族自由和民主。在许多资本主义国家中，工人群众强烈地趋于左倾。社会党、基督教工会和其他组织的绝大多数普通成员是拥护和平的。
    可以预料得到，团结一致的思想将越来越深得工人阶级的各部分队伍的拥护，而且将导致实际的结果。但是，这不会自然而然产生，这将在很大的程度上取决于我们共产党人，取决于我们在这方面的积极性。
    党中央委员会的总结报告对于迫切的国际问题所制定的理论原理的意义，是怎样估计也不会过高的。毫无疑问，这些原理对于一切进步力量的团结将有重大的意义，并且能够对所有先进的力量给予帮助，这些先进的力量正在努力奋斗，争取持久和平，争取用能够使各国人民摆脱剥削、战争和一切方式的社会和民族压迫的先进的新社会制度，来代替已经腐朽的资本主义制度。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    把党的组织工作提高到适应新任务的水平
    同志们！在所总结的这一段时期中，党还以同样的积极性和主动精神解决国家内部发展的问题。这种积极性的基础是，党清晰地看到了国家进一步发展的迫切需要。
    党大胆地揭露了在经济、政治、党务各方面活动中的缺点。党在中央委员会几次全体会议上制定了急速提高农业和改进工业工作的广泛纲领。党号召劳动人民作出新的努力来改组集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作以及工业企业的工作，并且进行了巨大的组织工作。可以大胆地说，像我们党现在在我国实行的重大的经济措施，还是自从工业化和集体化以来所从来没有过的。在两年中我们能够把国内播种面积增加3，000万公顷以上，等于某几个欧洲国家播种面积的总和。这一点说明我们的党现在是有能力担负最重大的任务的。
    党所进行的巨大工作收到了成果。在农业中，我们在增产谷物、工业原料作物和发展畜牧业方面迈进了一大步，已经创造了条件在最近几年大大增加农产品的生产，满足国家不断增长的需要。在工业方面，四年另四个月的时间就完成了五年计划这一点也表明了，在我们国民经济的这个部门中蕴藏着多么巨大的潜力。
    我们现在可以在已经取得的成就的基础上提出新的巨大的任务。我们现在不仅可以迅速地发展作为整个国民经济基础的重工业，而且还可以迅速地发展消费品的生产，大大增加社会财富，以及在这个基础上大力增进广大人民的福利。在代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案中提出了这些任务。第六个五年计划的实现将意味着社会主义经济的新的巨大的成就，将意味着我国在生产丰富的消费品、在建设共产主义方面又前进一大步。
    同志们！苏联人民将以极其欢欣鼓舞的心情和新的劳动高潮来欢迎党中央委员会所规定的关于在第六个五年计划中进一步改进苏联人民的生活条件的措施，赫鲁晓夫同志谈到了这些措施的内容是：在第六个五年计划期间过渡到所有工人和职员实行7小时工作制，在地面下工作的采煤和采矿工业中重要行业的工人实行6小时工作制而不减少工资，最近即将把星期六和节日的工作日缩短两小时，提高薪金较低的工人和职员的工资，整顿养老金的制度，急剧扩大住宅的建设（为第五个五年计划的两倍），改进食堂和其他生活福利机构的工作。所有这一切措施将把苏联人民的福利提高到新的水平。党关心所有的人，关心劳动人民，关心青年——我们的希望和未来，关心劳动战线上的老战士，关心妇女和儿童，关心每一个人，这是在社会主义社会中所应有的现象。
    这些拟定的措施引起了外国的广泛的反应。所有正直的人们同我们一起感到欢喜。但是也有一些对这种措施不感到欢喜的人。苏联新的五年计划的公布引起了某些集团的不满。这些集团已经毫不怀疑，苏联的这个五年计划一定会完成。现在，所有的人都承认这一点。这些集团所害怕的是另外的东西。美国高等法院法官道格拉斯不久以前曾经公开地在文章中讲到这一点。他说：“如果俄国能够争取到和平，那怕是十年的和平，它就能够大大提高自己国家的生活水平。这样它就能够对于亚洲以及欧洲给予巨大的影响……。微笑的、和平的和繁荣的俄国是一个最困难的国际问题。”
    道格拉斯先生面对两种社会制度的和平经济竞赛显然感到不安，但是我们并不打算安慰他。仅仅应当指出，和平的和繁荣的俄国对于全世界普通的劳动人民绝不是“困难的国际问题”，普通的劳动人民公正地认为苏联劳动人民的成就是伟大的和平、民主和社会主义事业的胜利。（经久不息的掌声）
    第六个五年计划是两种制度的和平经济竞赛的一个重要阶段。这个阶段的特点是：苏维埃国家目前拥有一切的必要条件，以便在历史上最短的时期内解决苏联的主要经济任务——在生产量按人口平均计算方面赶上并且超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    为此，我们必须保证我国整个国民经济过渡到新的、更高的技术水平，大大提高劳动生产率。目前，这就是保证社会主义在同资本主义竞赛中获胜的主要的东西。因此，生产的经济问题就有了从来没有过的意义。
    经济领导和各个部的工作、各企业、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导人员的工作应该提高到新的水平。
    在这种情况下，对党组织的工作也提出了特别的要求。
    我们的党在第二十次代表大会召开的时候比任何时候都更加一致和团结了。党的正确的政治路线，它为劳动人民的利益而进行活动的无穷的力量，比任何时候都更紧密地把全体苏联人民团结在党的周围，更加加强了工人阶级同农民的联盟和我国各民族人民伟大的、牢不可破的友谊。
    党在思想上和组织上的团结是它的力量和坚强性的基本条件，也是它一切胜利的源泉。共产党就是依靠自己队伍的团结才成功地解决了对内和对外政策上的问题，领导了经济和文化的建设。
    党的团结的加强和它的积极性、首创性和战斗力的提高，在很大程度上是由于恢复了在党的十九次代表大会以前常常遭到破坏的、由列宁制定的党的生活的准则和党的领导原则。
    不符合马克思列宁主义精神的个人崇拜的理论和实践，在党的十九次代表大会以前很普遍，这种理论和实践给党的组织工作和思想工作带来了很大的危害。它们缩小了人民群众和党的作用，减弱了集体领导，破坏了党内民主，压制了党员的积极性、主动性和首创精神，造成放任自流、不负责任，甚至造成某些人工作中的专断，阻挠了批评和自我批评的开展，产生了片面性，往往使问题得到错误的解决。
    恢复列宁主义的集体领导原则就意味着恢复党的建设的基础的基础。事实上，我们的党等于一个活的具有独创精神的组织。党的组织集体领导、选举制度和工作报告制度以及批评和自我批评，都是发扬主动性，发现工作中的错误和缺点，寻求消除错误和缺点的办法和发挥共产党员积极性的重要条件。
    集体领导的原则目前正在从中央委员会到基层组织的各级机构中成功地恢复起来，批评和自我批评的日益开展以及各级党的机关的真正集体地讨论和解决问题，就是这方面的证明。可以没有丝毫疑问地说，在中央委员会中，集体领导的原则已经完全恢复了。一切重大问题的决定，都归经常召开的中央委员会全体会议掌握，这个党的广泛的集体活动的中心，同建设共产主义社会的工作的决定性部分有最密切的联系。中央委员会以马克思列宁主义为依据的集体经验，保证了对党和国家的正确领导，保证了党的队伍不可动摇的团结。 （掌声）
    必须力求完全克服个人崇拜的有害理论和实践，并且在所有党组织的工作中严格实行集体领导的原则，每个党的工作人员应当彻底了解集体领导的原则的意义——这是党的统一、制定正确的政策和胜利地实现这些政策、正确地培养干部和使整个党的工作有新的高涨的最重要的条件。
    党的团结、组织性和战斗力在极大程度上取决于它的成员。
    党不是把所有表示愿意参加党的队伍的人都接收入党的。它接收最先进、最积极的人，它根据某个活动阶段中所面临的任务来调整接收工作。在工业化和农业集体化的时期，接收入党的主要是工人和农民。在战争年代中，接收入党的主要是在前线的人。不必需要再加证明，在目前，当解决急剧增加物质财富生产的任务的时候，合理的做法是首先应当着重接收这些福利的直接生产者——工人和集体农庄庄员。（掌声）
    党接收党员的工作情况怎样呢？ 必须指出：最近两年中，在被接收入党的人员中，工人和集体农庄庄员的比重比前几年增加了。
    但是在许多党组织里，被吸收入党的新党员中工人和集体农庄庄员所占的比重很小。常常有这样的情况：许多党组织条件是差不多一样的，但是其中一部分组织接收工人和集体农庄庄员入党的比例却比别的组织要低得多。斯维德洛夫斯克州和新西伯利亚州几乎是同样发达的两个工业地区。但是斯维德洛夫斯克州党组织在1955年接收入党的党员中工人的比例占47.2％，而新西伯利亚州只占32.2％。鄂木斯克州在被接收入党的党员中集体农庄庄员占31.7％，而在斯大林格勒州只占11.4％。为什么新西伯利亚州接收入党的工人要比斯维德洛夫斯克州少，斯大林格勒州接收入党的集体农庄庄员要比鄂木斯克州少呢？ 这不外乎是由于新西伯利亚州和斯大林格勒州的党组织不关心吸收党员的问题。遗憾的是，其他还有一些党组织也有这种情况。
    应当记住：工作的成绩同党组织中党员的成份是有很大关系的。党组织应当在调整接收新党员的工作方面提高要求，大力提高工人和集体农庄庄员在被接收入党的新党员中的比例。
    组织工作的意义是重大的，要事业取得成就，要胜利地解决第六个五年计划的重大经济任务首先取决于组织工作，这些都不必多谈了。因此，关于坚决提高领导水平，特别是区级的领导水平的问题是非常尖锐的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中揭露了党的地方领导机构在工作方法上的许多严重缺点，如爱讲空话，文牍主义，不深入研究经济的领导，不善于组织人们去消除缺点和克服困难，以及在工业和农业中推广先进工作者和革新者的经验和科学成就。
    自从中央委员会要求坚决纠正高高在上的官僚主义领导方法以后，各地州委会、边疆区委会、市委会、区委会的工作有了一些改进。各种会议减少了，党的工作人员开始比较经常地到企业、集体农庄和国营农场中去，努力于更多地帮助搞好地方工作。但是，这方面的工作做得还很少。遗憾的是，还有不少的党组织现在还忙于开会，忙于公文往来，而不是忙于在群众中进行组织工作，这些事和以前一样地浪费着工作人员的主要时间和精力。这种工作作风会产生什么样的结果是不难猜想的。人们不断地开会，写公文，而工作却没有进展。白俄罗斯维切布斯克州麦霍夫区区党委书记伊格纳金科同志在上次州党委会议上说过：“10年来我们这个区和其他一些区一直受到批评，被认为是落后的区。在这段时间内区里的区委书记更换了19个，区执行委员会主席更换了6个。现在区里设有9个调查和研究情况的委员会，但是这个区和过去一样仍然是落后的。州党委和州执行委员会实际上没有解决如何帮助我们这个区的具体问题。”
    基层党组织中文牍主义的坏习气非常盛行，这一点往往还是区党委会促成的，区党委会要求“洋洋大篇”的会议纪录、各式各样的报告和资料等等。这一来，有的基层党组织的书记最关心的不是对人进行工作，而是纸上的工作，这个工作耗费了他全部的主要时间。
    阿塞拜疆共和国沙木霍尔区基洛夫集体农庄党组织书记鲁斯塔莫夫同志的工作情况就是一个这样的例子。在他的桌上、书架上堆满了成捆的公文夹子和笔记本。他得登记党小组的工作、妇女工作、青年党员工作，帮助共青团组织、各种申请和控诉、给党员的指令、党的教育和业余戏剧小组的工作等等。他的那些夹子上写着：“墙报”、“战斗小报”、“畜牧业工作竞赛”、“田间工作竞赛”、“植林之友”。鼓动员的工作被登记在3个本子里：“鼓动员工作纪录”、“群众政治工作纪录”、“鼓动员每日任务”。大家设想一下，这些事必然会使这位书记在同活生生的组织工作脱离的公文上花多少时间。而对集体农庄的挤奶员和畜牧工作者没有进行一点教育工作。在牲畜饲养场上没有实现一点机械化，没有工作日程，没有规定牲畜的每口饲料量。牲畜的产品生产率非常低：每头奶牛每年平均只出484公升奶。可是，书记的那些夹子可没有挤出一点奶呀。在这方面，这些夹子是决不会下牛犊的。（笑声，掌声）
    必须改进党机构的工作，彻底铲除文牍主义的工作方法。党组织注意的中心应当放在群众工作上，迅速转向对经济建设工作进行具体的内行的领导，认真地组织在各企业、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场里宣传和推广先进经验和科学成就的工作。
    必须精简党机构的编制，使它由数量不多，然而是业务熟练的工作人员组成。中央委员会把它的机构精简了25％。我认为这只是进一步精简的开端。党的边疆区委会、州委会、加盟共和国共产党中央委员会，党的市委会和区委会应当随着布置和实行精简党的机构。这样做，对它们的工作只有好处。
    在这里，我想就民政机构的政治部的工作说几句话。在建立了政治部的地方，政治部曾经起过相当积极的作用，但是，现在它们的表现少了，而是重复地方党组织的工作。赫鲁晓夫同志正确地谈到了铁路运输业方面技术落后的情况。显然，铁路政治部的工作人员也应当对这种落后现象负责。如果不向他们提出铁路运输方面技术落后的问题，那么该向谁提呢？但是他们是否表示了意见呢，他们是否为技术进步说过话呢？没有。看来，关于取消政治部的问题是完全成熟了。（掌声）
    思想工作脱离生活的有害现象应当终止
    同志们！赫鲁晓夫同志在中央委员会的报告中全面地分析了党组织的思想工作，他指出，现在主要的缺点是大大脱离了生活，不善于综合和在群众中宣扬先进的、经过生活考验的共产主义建设的典型，在同阻碍我们前进的不良现象作斗争方面，积极性也很不够。这是正确的、公正的批评。
    党认为思想工作是共产主义建设的整个工作的不可分割的一部分。党的思想工作的主要任务是：对建设共产主义和提高劳动生产率给予实际的帮助，用一切方法提高群众的社会主义觉悟，同人们思想中的资本主义残余、同资产阶级思想和资产阶级道德进行坚决的斗争，以马克思列宁主义理论武装劳动人民、首先是武装领导干部，创造性地发展马克思列宁主义理论。
    然而，我们党的思想工作在解决所有这些重大任务方面是做得不够的，在很大程度上是徒劳无益的，变成死记那些大家知道的公式和原理，经常培养出脱离生活的书呆子和教条主义者。
    我们的宣传的锋芒在很大的程度上针对着过去和历史，而不顾及当前的问题。此外，我们的党史的教学方式不能使历史经验有助于正确地理解今天的问题。对于经济知识和先进的工人、工程师、集体农民、先进的企业、集体农庄、国营农场和工作队的工作经验的宣传，我们作得很坏。
    我们听说，成百万的共产党员在党的教育系统中一连许多年研究民粹派、经济派和崩得分子的错误观点，而不去研究怎样同我们自己人的思想意识当中的资本主义残余进行斗争和如何揭露国际舞台上的我们目前的思想敌人，也不去研究国内的经济发展、革新工作者、先进的企业和集体农庄的经验以及科学的成就，以便最有效地管理经济、提高劳动生产率、增加物质资料的生产和圆满地解决共产主义建设的其他任务。
    许多普通的共产党员也认识到了这种不正常的情况。斯大林格勒州米哈伊洛夫机器拖拉机站的收获联合机手伊格纳托夫同志很好地讲到这一点。他说：“我在小组中学习党史已经有13年了。宣传员向我们讲解了13次关于崩得的问题。难道我们除了批判崩得，就没有更为重要的事情吗？（笑声）我们感到兴趣的是我们的机器拖拉机站、区和州的事业。我们希望活在现在和将来，而我们的宣传员却深陷在民粹主义分子和崩得分子的事件中，再也拔不出来了。”（笑声，掌声）
    由此可见，党的宣传工作开始丧失战斗的布尔什维克精神。
    我们大多数宣传员对生产中的经济问题了解很少。领导这些宣传人员和教育他们的常常也是不懂得生产或对生产只有最一般的概念的人。出路何在呢？出路是：坚决使我们的经济领导者、党的领导者和苏维埃领导者们注意宣传工作，特别是经济知识的宣传工作。
    必须提高对宣传员的要求。不要追求宣传员的数量，而是要选择真正善于把我们的宣传工作同经济和文化建设的实际任务联系在一起的有才干的人。
    同时，必须对宣传员进行经常的工作，应当懂得，如果党机构不领导他们，不指引他们认清当前的任务，不帮助指导他们，不以具体的材料和事实武装他们，那么最好的宣传员也会“枯竭”和“干瘪”。应当改革培养和调训宣传员的制度，使他们能够获得工业和农业方面的必要知识。
    十分遗憾，不仅在我们的宣传工作方面存在着脱离和落后于生活和实际的缺点，而且在理论战线上也在很大程度上存在着这样的缺点。
    例如，拿经济科学为例。在现阶段，研究我们社会经济发展的深刻进程应当是研究和发展马克思主义思想的工作中的主要的决定的方向。这并不是说，应当放松对研究党的过去的革命经验或马克思列宁主义的哲学的注意。但是，在苏维埃社会的发展中我们已经临到应当把主要的注意力集中在研究和探讨经济科学的阶段，因为认识社会主义经济发展的客观规律首先就能够运用这些规律来加速共产主义建设。
    政治经济学教科书的出版在这方面是一个令人高兴的事。但是，光是一本教科书还是不够的，而遗憾的是创造性地研究经济现象的重要科学著作还是太少了。
    某些经济学家在自己的著作中犯了严重的错误。党必须纠正那些宣扬放慢重工业发展速度这种反马克思主义观点的蹩脚经济学家。经济学家否认在社会主义制度之下仍然存在技术设备的无形损耗这一范畴，造成了很严重的损失，这事实上为技术界中的因循守旧和保守造成理论上的根据。
    经济学家没有好好研究价值规律在社会主义生产中的作用。我们的建筑师迷恋于多余的装饰，而不考虑人民的戈比，机器拖拉机站和集体农庄中往往还是不考虑生产一公担谷物、肉类所花费的代价，这些情况毫无疑问，是受到了经济学家们没有好好地研究价值规律在我国经济中如何具体地起作用这个问题的影响。
    研究国民经济具体部门的经济问题的科学工作处在无人过问的情况下。苏联有40多个科学研究机关是应该研究农业生产经济的。但是，它们在综合集体农庄和国营农场所积累的丰富经验方面的工作做得很少。
    农业经济学的教科书以及工业经济学的教科书的出版拖得太久了。
    在哲学方面也存在着理论思想脱离我们生活中的迫切任务和共产主义建设迫切任务的现象。
    首先是由于脱离实际，一部分经济学家和哲学家普遍地沾染上了学究习气和教条主义的习气。这种学究习气的恶习的实质不单是在于染上这种毛病的人动不动就引经据典，而在于他们认为判断正确的最高标准不是实践，而是权威人士就某个问题发表的言论。他们没有研究具体实际情况的兴趣，他们以挑选引语和运用这种引语的艺术代替一切。他们认为稍微违反引语就是修改原理。学究们的这种活动不仅没有好处，反而有害处。（掌声）
    毫无疑问，对个人的崇拜大大助长了教条主义和学究习气的传播。个人崇拜的信徒把马克思理论的发展只归功于个别人士，完全信赖他们。所有其余的人似乎只须通晓和传播这些个别人士所创造的东西就行了。这样就忽视了我们党的集体思想的作用和兄弟党在发展革命理论方面的作用以及人民群众集体经验的作用。
    党从来也不能容忍教条主义，而目前同教条主义的斗争特别地尖锐化了。我们经历的时代使得创造性地发展马克思主义的任务成为再迫切不过的了。我国的共产主义建设和人民民主国家的社会主义建设每天不断地提出新的问题，这些问题需要理论来作解答。全世界正在发生重大的变化，许多问题在现在看来是另一个样子了。这一切要求不要落后于生活，要求科学地研究新的问题，要求进一步丰富和发展马克思主义。列宁指出马克思主义的创造性的时候着重说：“我们并不把马克思底理论视为一成不变和神圣不可侵犯的东西；恰巧相反，我们深信，它只是为一门科学奠定了基础，而社会主义者如果不愿落后于实际生活，就应当在各方面把这门科学推向前进。”（列宁全集第四卷第191页）
    这种任务摆在我们面前，特别是摆在我们的经济学家和哲学家的面前。党期待他们在总结苏联和人民民主国家的社会主义建设的丰富经验和深刻分析现代资本主义的种种现象的基础上，写出能够对苏维埃、经济和党的干部给予理论帮助的学术巨著。当然，马克思主义者说要在总结新的实践和整个科学成就的基础上把革命理论向前推进，意思永远是说他们要在马克思列宁主义的不可动摇的原则的基础上、在同所有修改这种原则的企图进行不可调和的斗争中来进一步发展和丰富马克思列宁主义。
    我们思想工作的缺点十分严重。党不能容忍这种缺点。
    一切党组织自上而下的任务是：消除这些缺点，保证我们的思想工作迅速地转向生活、实践和共产主义建设的具体问题，使宣传鼓动首先同每一个企业和集体农庄在增加物质资料生产方面所面临的任务密切地联系起来。
    必须经常关心提高劳动人民的社会主义觉悟，回答他们提出来的急迫的和尖锐的问题，不放松同人们意识中的资本主义残余进行斗争，坚决揭露帝国主义资产阶级的反动意识形态。我们在争取国际紧张局势进一步缓和，争取加强和平事业的时候，不仅不应该削弱我们对资产阶级的意识形态、帝国主义和殖民主义的批评，相反，应该为了上面谈的那些目的而加强这种批评，用令人信服的例子和事实来揭露帝国主义的侵略思想和政策，揭露资本主义制度的剥削本质，用社会主义制度来和这个注定要灭亡的制度相对比，表明社会主义制度的巨大优越性、崇高的原则和目标。
    应该使我们的思想工作重新具备党在几十年以来所创立的那种布尔什维克的战斗准备和追求既定目标的精神，使这个工作服从于争取共产主义的胜利的任务。
    今后仍将不倦地关怀宣传工作，关怀在新的经验的基础上创造性地发展马克思列宁主义理论，这个理论是我们的整个政策和全部活动的科学基础，是成功地进行共产主义建设所必需的领导。
    同志们！这次代表大会的历史意义是无论怎样估计也不会过高的。代表大会向我们的党、向全国和苏联人民指出了建设共产主义的壮丽远景，使人感到快乐得激动，感到自豪。我们面前摆着多么伟大的任务，我们胜利地解决这些任务的可能性是多么无穷无尽。苏维埃人面前展开了多么美好的生活。我们的社会主义祖国在不远的将来将怎样在政治、经济和文化方面变得更加强大，更加坚强。同时，其他兄弟的社会主义国家、整个伟大的社会主义大家庭将要和它一起成长、巩固和繁荣。（经久不息的掌声）
    在这种美妙的远景之前，我们的党处在磐石般的团结、具有巨大的创造性积极性和战斗力的状态中。它得到全体苏联人民的无限热爱和支持。它有英明的不可战胜的马克思列宁主义学说作为它的武器。
    毫无疑问，在第二十次代表大会以后，党将在争取我们祖国进一步繁荣、争取国际和平、争取共产主义在我国胜利的斗争中取得新的更大的胜利。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
