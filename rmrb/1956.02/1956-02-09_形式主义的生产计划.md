    Formalistic Production Plans
    After the Wangcheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anhua County, Hunan Province, formulated its production plan, nearby cooperatives all came to copy it. Some even traveled more than 20 *li* to copy the plan. In Chengbu County, the production plans of two cooperatives in the Fourth District were taken care of entirely by the cooperative cadres; when the cooperative cadres left, they took the production plans of these two cooperatives with them. In the Fifth District of Zixing County, some cooperatives formulated production plans solely for the purpose of obtaining loans; once the loans were secured, no one paid any attention to the plans.
    Production plans formulated in this way obviously cannot guide production. Rural Party branches and rural workers should educate cooperative members and cooperative cadres to understand the significance of formulating production plans and earnestly help new cooperatives formulate practical and feasible production plans.

    形式主义的生产计划
    湖南省安化县望城农业生产合作社定出生产计划之后，附近的合作社都来照抄，有的甚至跑20多里路来抄计划。城步县第四区有两个社的生产计划是办社干部包办代定的，办社干部一走，把这两个社的生产计划也带走了。资兴县五区有个别社定生产计划是为了贷款；款贷到了，计划也就没人理会了。
    这样制定的生产计划，显然是不能指导生产的。农村党支部和农村工作人员应该教育社员和社干部懂得定生产计划的意义，并且认真帮助新社制定切实可行的生产计划。
