The Guanting Agricultural Production Cooperative is a multi-ethnic agricultural production cooperative organized by farmers in Guanting Township, Minhe County, Qinghai Province. It is located in a lush area on the banks of the Yellow River where Qinghai and Gansu meet.

Guanting is a concentrated area of the Tu ethnic group and a mixed ethnic area. The Guanting Cooperative is one of the largest agricultural production cooperatives in Qinghai Province, with the following ethnic composition: 221 Tu households, 22 Hui households, and 3 Han households. The cooperative owns 4,000 mu of land, more than 150 head of large livestock, and has seeders, harvesters, and many other new-style farm tools.

The Tu ethnic group is one of the smaller ethnic groups in China, mainly residing in the Mutual Help Tu Autonomous County and Guanting District of Minhe County, Qinghai Province. The Tu ethnic group formed in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Their language is similar to Mongolian, and their customs are close to those of the Han. In the old society, they suffered deep oppression and were not recognized as a nation. When the Tu people went to markets and fairs, the pawns of the ruling class arbitrarily knocked off the hats of their men and tore the lace skirts of their women. They cried silently, burying their anger. After liberation, the Tu ethnic group was immediately recognized as one of China's fraternal ethnic groups and respected everywhere. They can wear their ethnic costumes and speak their own language. To this day, they cannot help but shed tears of emotion when talking about this.

After 1951, Tu farmers enthusiastically participated in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. "Labor exchange teams" and "farming groups" soon grew into year-round mutual aid groups. In the winter of 1953, three mutual aid groups led by Liu Wende, Zhang Yansheng, and Lü Cunbao formed an agricultural production cooperative consisting of 23 Tu households.

The local area is often drought-stricken. For more than 40 years, local farmers have understood how to change the soil and protect groundwater by applying sand. However, they have never had the strength to expand the scale of sand application, and each household could only apply sand to a small piece of land. As soon as the cooperative was established, it mobilized 30 laborers every day to apply sand, covering 60 mu in one spring. The sand-applied land yielded about 100% to 200% more than the non-sand-applied land. In the same year, they also began to introduce peanut varieties from Shaanxi on a large area of land with poor soil quality, rationally utilizing the land, and increasing crop types and yields. Mountain floods flowed into Guanting every autumn, always short in duration and fierce in force, washing away all the dikes and then discharging into the Yellow River. Before each flood, the agricultural production cooperative would send out signals, and more than 200 people, men, women, and children, would be dispatched to guard the 7 dams, day and night, using soil and stone to reinforce and divert the water, finally irrigating every drop of floodwater into the land. Coupled with the agricultural cooperative's increased fertilizer application and other measures, production increased by 57% in 1954.

Increased production consolidated the members' confidence in taking the socialist road and also attracted many individual farmers. After the summer harvest that year, more than 60 households of farmers joined the agricultural cooperative; at the end of the year, another group was absorbed, expanding to 204 households.

In 1955, the Guanting Agricultural Production Cooperative carried out large-scale soil improvement and capital construction. In the spring, the entire cooperative invested 7,650 labor days, laying 450 mu of sandy fields. It mobilized 204 laborers to turn over 1,100 mu of land with iron shovels, greatly increasing the land's moisture retention capacity. It reinforced the original 8 dikes, using them to control floods for a long time; it dug a 120-zhang canal to divert water from the Baojiagou River, turning another 300 mu of dry land into paddy fields. In the past, the habit of the farmers here was to leave half the land fallow and plant half (because the land was barren). The agricultural cooperative rewarded every household for accumulating fertilizer and mobilized manpower to collect wild fertilizer from the mountains at a distance, striving for 50% of the land to be fertilized. The entire cooperative planted more than 3,700 mu of land, except for 50 mu of fallow land.

This year, they also improved the labor organization, divided the production teams, and allocated land near the residential areas of each team, combining small plots into large plots. This measure not only made the land easier to manage but also expanded the cultivated land by 120 mu by removing ridges. They implemented a piece-rate system in most production teams, greatly encouraging labor enthusiasm. Many members worked two hundred forty or fifty labor days a year, and some full laborers worked three hundred forty or fifty labor days.

In 1955, although the weather was once dry, the cooperative still increased production. The total output of the cooperative increased by 91% compared with 1953. The income of member Lü Changmingde in 1954 increased three and a half times compared with 1953, and the income in 1955 increased five and a half times compared with 1953. He changed from a grain-deficient household to a surplus grain household, laid felt on the earthen kang for the first time, and began to have cotton quilts to spend the night. The income of wealthy middle peasants Lü Huhu and Lü Sibaxi also increased by 50% to 54% respectively. They not only stopped complaining but also praised the superiority of socialism with smiles.

The Hui people near the Guanting Cooperative are almost all semi-farmers and semi-peddlers; although they are very poor, most of them lack the habit of collective labor. The bumper harvest of the Guanting Agricultural Cooperative in 1954 had a great impact on the Hui masses. They wanted to join the cooperative, but they had many concerns. They went to the township people's committee, the agricultural cooperative, and even the Ahong to inquire. The personnel of the agricultural cooperative replied to them: "The cooperative will definitely guarantee freedom of religion and belief, respect the customs of the Hui people, and give them freedom and convenience; the Hui people can not participate in the sideline production of raising pigs." The Ahong replied: "Joining the cooperative is in accordance with the classics, and pig manure on the land does not hinder anything, and it has nothing to do with eating pork."

Eight Hui farming households, led by Township Head Ma Youlu, joined the cooperative in July of the same year. The agricultural cooperative took care of the Hui members as meticulously as if they were their own brothers. In the spring of 1955, when the old grain ran out and the new grain was not yet available, all the Hui members' difficulties in eating grain were taken over by the cooperative; other members also lent money and grain. When the Hui people were chanting scriptures, the Hui members did not come, and the cooperative did not call them either. During Ramadan, the Tu members were afraid of arousing the Hui members' appetite when eating, so they always stayed far away. In daily life, they politely called them "Hui ethnic group" instead of "Hui Zi." When two Hui members held weddings, it was simply a great joy for the cooperative, and almost all the Tu members of the cooperative took gifts to congratulate them, which was very lively. The Hui members deeply felt the warmth of the united family of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Communist Party.

At the members' congress, the Hui member Ma Decang was unanimously elected as the captain of the first production team and a member of the management committee; Ma Youyou was elected as the captain of the sideline team. This showed the Tu members' respect and trust for the Hui members, and finally dispelled the Hui farmers' doubts. They also showed great respect for the Tu members. Ma Decang's production experience was not as much as that of the deputy captain Lü Sixiyi (Tu ethnic group), and some members also doubted Ma Decang's leadership ability. However, Ma Decang was very modest, discussed things with the members, and asked the deputy captain for advice. He got up early and went to bed late, was enthusiastic about team affairs, never absented himself, and always took the lead in working hard. As a result of such diligent exercise, he not only became familiar with agricultural farming, but also received the deep respect of the members for doing more than 340 labor days from July 1954 to May 1955. Everyone affectionately called him "Captain Ma." At the beginning of last year, Ma Decang distributed 2,720 jin of pure grain (including 1,840 jin of wheat). This year's income was more than double the highest year of production before he joined the cooperative. Most of the Hui masses outside the cooperative were extremely excited to hear this news. They saw that the two ethnic groups could work together, help each other, influence each other, and encourage each other, and they could indeed get rid of poverty. From the end of 1955 to the beginning of 1956, another 14 Hui farmers successively signed up to join the cooperative.

The new and old members of the Guanting Cooperative are busy with winter production; the staff of the cooperative are nervously closing accounts and making plans for comprehensive development. It can be predicted that this "chorus" composed of farmers from three ethnic groups will sing a more harmonious and moving tune this year.

    三族农民组成的官亭农业合作社
    李根蒂　胡俊德
    官亭农业生产合作社是青海省民和县官亭乡农民组织成的一个多民族的农业生产合作社。它建立在青海同甘肃交界处黄河岸上的树木丰盛的地方。
    官亭是土族聚居区，又是多族杂居区。官亭社是青海省最大的农业生产合作社之一，它的民族成分是：土族221户，回族22户，汉族3户。全社拥有4，000亩土地，大牲畜150多头，有播种机、收割机和别的许多新式农具。
    土族是我国人数很少的民族之一，只在青海省的互助土族自治县和民和县官亭区聚居。土族在明末清初形成，说话近似蒙语，风俗习惯接近汉族。他们在旧社会遭受压迫较深，没有被承认为一个民族。土族人民赶集赶会，统治阶级的爪牙随意打翻他们男人的帽子，撕去他们妇女的花边裙子。他们悄悄哭着，埋藏了满腔愤怒。解放后，土族立即被承认为我国兄弟民族之一，到处受到尊重。他们可以身着民族服装，说自己的语言。至今谈起这件事，他们还不禁感动得流泪。
    1951年以后，土族农民热烈地参加了农业生产互助合作运动，“变工队”“种地组”不久就成长为常年互助组。1953年冬季，以刘文德、张彦昇、吕存保领导的三个互助组为基础，组成了包括23户土族农民的一个农业生产合作社。
    当地经常天旱，本地农民40多年以来就懂得用施沙方法改变土壤，保护地下水分；但是，一直没力量扩大施沙的规模，每户仅能做到在一小片土地上施沙。合作社一成立，就每天动员30个劳力施沙，一个春天施了60亩。施沙地比不施沙地约增产100％到200％。同年，又着手在大面积土质较差的地上引种陕西种的花生，合理利用土地，增加作物种类和产量。山洪每年秋天流入官亭，总是时间短促，水势猛烈，把全部堤坝冲垮，然后泄入黄河。农业生产合作社在每次洪水到来以前就发出信号，男女老少200多人全体出动，守着7个坝堤，不分昼夜，用土、石抢堵抢引，终于把每一滴洪水都灌进土地。加上农业合作社增施肥料等措施，1954年增产57％。
    增产巩固了社员走社会主义道路的信心，也吸引了不少单干农民。当年夏收之后，就有60多户农民参加了农业合作社；年底又吸收了一批，扩大到204户。
    1955年，官亭农业生产合作社大规模地改良土壤，进行基本建设。春天，全社投入7，650个劳动日，铺成450亩沙田，动员204个劳动力用铁锨把1，100亩土地翻了一遍，大大增加了土地保墒能力。加固了原有的8条堤坝，用它长期控制洪水；从包家沟河挖成引水的120丈长的渠道，又把300亩旱地变成水地。往年这里农民的习惯是歇一半地、种一半地（因为地瘦）。农业合作社奖励家家积肥，并且动员人力进山远距离搜集野肥，争取到50％的土地得到肥料。全社除50亩歇地外，3，700多亩土地全部播种了。
    这一年，他们还改进了劳动组织，划分了生产队，按各队居住地区就近拨地，合小片为大片。这项措施不仅使土地便于经营，还因去掉楞坎扩大了120亩耕地。他们在大部分生产队实行了按件计工制，极大地鼓舞了劳动积极性，不少社员一年工作了二百四、五十个劳动日，一部分全劳力做到三百四、五十个劳动日。
    1955年，虽然天气一度干旱，这个社仍然增产了。全社总产量比1953年增加了91％。社员吕长命德1954年的收入比1953年增加了三倍半，1955年的收入比1953年增加了五倍半。他由缺粮户变成了余粮户，第一次给土炕上铺了毡，也开始有了棉被度夜。富裕中农吕糊糊、吕四百喜两户的收入也各增加了50％到54％。他们不仅不再说怪话了，还笑眯眯地夸奖社会主义的优越性。
    官亭社附近的回民，几乎全是半农半做小贩；虽然十分贫穷，但大多缺乏集体劳动习惯。官亭农业合作社1954年的丰收，对回族群众震动很大。他们想入社，但又有许多顾虑。他们到乡人民委员会、农业合作社以至阿訇那里去打听。农业合作社的人员回答他们：“合作社一定保障宗教、信仰自由，尊重回族风俗习惯，给以自由和方便；养猪的副业生产，回族可以不参加。”阿訇回答：“入社合乎经典，猪肥上地不妨碍，它和吃猪肉毫无关系。”
    有8户回族农户，由乡长马有禄带头，在同年7月间入了社。农业合作社对回族社员同亲兄弟一样无微不至地照顾。1955年春天青黄不接，回族社员的吃粮困难全部由社里包了下来；别的社员又借给钱和粮食。遇到回民念经的时候，回民社员不来，社里也就不叫。闭斋期，土族社员吃东西怕引起回族社员食欲，总是远远离开。日常客气地称“回族”而不叫“回子”。两户回族社员举行婚礼，简直成了合作社的大喜，全社土族社员几乎都拿着礼物去贺喜，十分热闹。回族社员深深感到在共产党领导下各民族团结的大家庭的温暖。
    在社员大会上，回族社员马德仓被一致选举为第一生产队队长，管委会委员；马有有被选为副业队队长。这表示土族社员对回族社员的敬重和信任，最后解除了回族农民的疑虑。他们对土族社员也表现出十分尊重。马德仓生产经验不如副队长吕四十一（土族）那样多，个别社员也有怀疑马德仓的领导本领的。但马德仓十分虚心，有事就同社员商量，请教副队长。他起早睡晚，热心队务工作，从不缺勤，每天总是带头苦干。这样努力锻炼的结果，他不仅熟悉了农业耕作，并且因1954年7月到1955年5月间做了340多个劳动日而受到社员深厚的尊重。大家亲切地叫他“马队长”。马德仓去年初分纯粮食2，720斤（其中有麦子1，840斤）。这年的收入比他入社前产量最高的一年还多一倍以上。大部社外回族群众听到这个消息心情极为振奋。他们看到两个民族可以在一起劳动，能够互相帮助，互相影响，彼此鼓励，也确实可以摆脱贫困。1955年底到1956年初，陆续又有14户回族农民报名入社。
    官亭社的新老社员们正在忙着冬季生产；社里的工作人员正在紧张地结账，做全面发展的计划。可以预祝，这一支由三个民族的农民组成的“合唱队”，今年将唱出更谐和更动人的曲调来。
