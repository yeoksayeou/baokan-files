Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 13th: To commemorate the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance on February 14th, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, who is currently in Moscow, gave a speech to television viewers on Moscow Television Station at 7:30 pm on the 12th. The full text of the speech is as follows:
    Dear Comrades and Friends:
    We have visited your great country, our close ally, the Soviet Union, with incomparable joy. Allow me to express here, once again, the fraternal respect and best wishes of the Chinese people to the Soviet people.
    A profound friendship has long existed between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, this friendship has been comprehensively developed. The unbreakable, brotherly friendship between China and the Soviet Union, solidified by the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, has been greatly strengthened in the past six years. Our two countries have engaged in the closest cooperation and mutual support in safeguarding the common interests of our two peoples and in the cause of world peace and progress.
    The Soviet Union has provided comprehensive, systematic, and selfless assistance to the efforts of the Chinese people to restore and develop their national economy. China's ability to quickly heal the wounds of war and enter large-scale socialist construction is inseparable from Soviet assistance. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude for the enormous fraternal assistance given by the Soviet people.
    We are very pleased to see that the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, have already achieved brilliant successes in the cause of building a communist society. The Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has been successfully completed, and now the great construction work of the Sixth Five-Year Plan has begun. These achievements play an inestimable role in promoting human progress and safeguarding world peace.
    The Chinese people, taking the Soviet people as an example, are also working hard under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government to build a socialist society at the fastest speed. 500 million farmers across the country have taken action to launch the agricultural cooperation movement. By the end of January this year, more than 2 million agricultural production cooperatives have been established nationwide, with more than 92.8 million households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 78% of the total number of households in the country. The cooperativization of handicrafts and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce across the country have also entered a high tide. By the end of January, more than 70% of cities and a considerable number of county towns across the country had fully realized the joint state-private operation of capitalist industry and commerce.
    In the high tide of the national socialist revolution, the labor enthusiasm of China's working class has also been unprecedentedly increased. The vast masses of workers across the country are launching competitions to overfulfill the 1956 plan and complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule. In order to build our country into a strong industrialized socialist country, our people are redoubling their efforts to learn from the great experience and unremitting spirit of the Soviet people in building socialism and communism, and are confidently advancing along the road of socialism by leaps and bounds.
    The Soviet Union, which unswervingly pursues the great Lenin's policy of peace, is a strong fortress for the cause of world peace. The unyielding efforts made by the Soviet government and people have played an extremely significant role in promoting the relaxation of international tensions. The Chinese people and government are determined to work with the great Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries, as well as all peace-loving countries and people in the world, to strive unremittingly for further relaxation of the international situation, consolidation of peace, and promotion of friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.
    Dear comrades and friends, as I conclude my speech, please allow me to sincerely congratulate you on achieving even greater successes in the cause of communist construction and the defense of world peace.
    Long live the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people! Long live the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!

    2月12日在莫斯科电视播送台
    朱德副主席发表讲话
    新华社莫斯科13日电　2月14日是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订六周年纪念日。为此，目前正在莫斯科的中华人民共和国副主席朱德12日晚7时半在莫斯科电视播送台向电视观众讲了话。讲话全文如下：亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们以无比愉快的心情访问了你们的伟大国家，我们的亲密的盟国苏联。让我在这里，再一次表达中国人民对苏联人民的兄弟的敬意和祝愿。
    中苏两国人民之间，早就存在着深厚的友谊。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，这种友谊更得到了全面的发展。中苏两国用友好同盟互助条约固定下来的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊，在过去六年中获得极大的加强。在维护我们两国人民的共同利益和世界和平和进步的事业中，我们两国进行了最紧密的合作和相互支持。
    苏联对中国人民恢复和发展自己国家的经济的努力，给了全面的、系统的和无私的援助。我国能迅速地治好战争创伤，并且进入大规模的社会主义建设，是和苏联的援助分不开的。中国人民对于苏联人民所给予的巨大的兄弟般的援助，表示衷心的感谢。
    我们很高兴地看到，伟大的苏联人民，在苏联共产党和苏联政府领导下，在建设共产主义社会的事业中已经获得了辉煌的成就。苏联发展国民经济的第五个五年计划已经胜利完成，现在又开始了第六个五年计划的巨大建设工作。这些成就对于促进人类进步和维护世界和平起了不可估量的作用。
    以苏联人民为榜样的中国人民，在共产党和政府的领导下，也正在奋发努力，以最快的速度建设社会主义社会。全国5万万农民已经行动起来，开展农业合作化运动，到今年1月底，全国已经建成200多万个农业生产合作社，入社农户达到9，280多万户，占全国农户总数78％。全国手工业合作化和资本主义工商业的改造也跟着进入高潮，到1月底，全国已经有70％以上的市和相当多的县城全部实现了资本主义工商业的全业合营。
    在全国的社会主义革命的高潮中，我国工人阶级的劳动积极性也空前提高，全国广大工人群众正在为超额完成1956年计划和提前完成第一个五年计划而展开竞赛。为了把我国建设成为一个强大的工业化的社会主义国家，我国人民正在加倍努力学习苏联人民建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大经验和奋斗不懈的精神，满怀信心地沿着社会主义的道路大踏步前进。
    坚定不移地奉行伟大列宁的和平政策的苏联是世界和平事业的坚强堡垒。苏联政府和人民所作的不屈不挠的努力，对于促进国际紧张局势的缓和，起了极其重大的作用。中国人民和政府决心同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家以及世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，为着争取进一步缓和国际局势、巩固和平和增进各国人民间的友好合作而不懈地奋斗。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，在结束我的谈话的时候，请允许我衷心地祝贺你们在共产主义建设和保卫世界和平的事业中获得更伟大的成就。
    伟大的苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民万岁！中苏两国人民间永恒的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
