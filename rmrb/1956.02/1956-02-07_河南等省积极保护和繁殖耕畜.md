Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and other provinces are earnestly carrying out the work of breeding and protecting draught animals. The 967 grassroots veterinary organizations in Henan Province are helping approximately 4,200 breeding households solve technical and material difficulties in raising breeding stock, so that female animals can be well-fertilized and become pregnant. According to the preliminary three-year plan for the development and protection of livestock in Henan Province, the province's large livestock population will increase to 7.9 million head this year, an increase of 4% compared to last year. In Shangxian County and other places in Shaanxi Province, many districts and townships convened meetings of veterinarians and breeders to exchange experiences in raising draught animals. After studying the State Council's instructions on protecting young livestock, many agricultural production cooperatives in Fufeng and other counties have strengthened their work in raising and breeding young livestock. People's committees in more than 150 counties in Sichuan Province, including Jianyang, Wanxian, and Wenjiang, have issued announcements to protect and develop draught cattle. The announcements contain specific provisions for cattle joining cooperatives, protecting draught cattle to safely pass the winter, preventing the indiscriminate slaughter of draught cattle, and rewarding the breeding of draught cattle. Now, the broad masses of peasants throughout the province have taken active action in accordance with the spirit of the announcements.

    河南等省积极保护和繁殖耕畜
    河南、陕西、四川等省认真开展繁殖和保护耕畜的工作。河南省967个兽医基层组织，正在帮助约4，200个种畜户解决饲养种畜的技术和物质的困难，使母畜能很好地受精怀胎。根据河南省今后3年发展和保护牲畜的初步规划，今年全省大家畜要发展到790万头，比去年增长4％。陕西省商县等地许多区乡召集兽医人员和饲养员开会，交流了饲养耕畜等经验。扶风等县许多农业生产合作社学习了国务院关于保护幼畜的指示以后，都加强了对幼畜的饲养和繁殖工作。四川省简阳、万县、温江等150多个县的县人民委员会为保护和发展耕牛都曾颁发布告。布告中对于耕牛入社、保护耕牛安全过冬、防止滥宰耕牛和奖励繁殖耕牛等方面都作了具体规定。现在，全省广大农民已经根据布告的精神积极行动起来。
