Xinhua News Agency, February 9th dispatch from Budapest: The session of the National Assembly of the Hungarian People's Republic opened in Budapest on February 8th.

    Hungarian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, András Hegedüs, delivered a report on Hungarian foreign policy at the meeting.

    Hegedüs pointed out that the characteristic of the Hungarian government's entire foreign policy last year was sincere cooperation for the improvement of the international atmosphere. Hungary demonstrated initiative in a series of matters. Through mutual efforts, relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia have improved. Hungary has strived to develop good relations with countries such as India, Egypt, Indonesia, and Syria, Sudan, and has strengthened ties with them.

    In order to further improve the international atmosphere and promote the rapprochement between East and West, the Hungarian government hopes to maintain normal relations with the three Western powers, the United States, Britain, and France.

    Hegedüs then said that, regrettably, the relationship between Hungary and the United States is far from the normal relationship that should be established between countries, but this is not Hungary's fault. Recent statements and expressions of desire by US government officials contain attempts to directly interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. I must say frankly that the era in which agents of imperialist countries could do as they pleased in Hungary is gone forever. Recently, many balloons have been discovered and intercepted in Hungarian airspace, equipped with American-made instruments, radio receivers, and transmitters, these are balloons released for military reconnaissance. The Hungarian government protests against this provocative action that violates Hungary's freedom and independence and threatens Hungary's security, and resolutely demands that this action be stopped.

    When speaking about the eight-nation Warsaw Treaty, Hegedüs emphasized that the Hungarian government attaches particular importance to cooperation between the countries of the socialist camp. It also believes that this cooperation, both in the past and now, is one of the most important factors in the further positive development of the international situation and the consolidation of peace. The Hungarian government firmly believes that there is a real possibility of further easing international tensions and strengthening international cooperation at present.

    Hegedüs emphasized that we hope to do our best to promote the resolution of the disarmament issue, and we will participate in all international activities aimed at consolidating European and world peace and security. We hope to cooperate with all countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual respect for sovereignty.

    After discussion, the National Assembly adopted Hegedüs' report and the work of the Hungarian government at the Prague meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states.

    赫格居斯向国民议会报告外交政策
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利人民共和国国民议会会议2月8日在布达佩斯开幕。
    匈牙利部长会议主席赫格居斯在会上作了关于匈牙利外交政策的报告。
    赫格居斯指出，去年匈牙利政府的整个外交政策的特点是：为改善国际气氛而诚意地进行合作。在一连串的事情上，匈牙利表现了主动精神。由于相互努力，匈牙利和南斯拉夫的关系得到了改善。匈牙利努力发展同印度、埃及、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、苏丹等国的良好关系，并且加强同它们的联系。
    为了进一步改善国际气氛和促进东西方的接近，匈牙利政府希望同美、英、法3个西方大国保持正常关系。
    赫格居斯接着说，十分遗憾，匈牙利和美国之间的关系远不符合国和国之间所要建立的正常关系，但是这并不是匈牙利的过错。最近美国政府人士所发表的言论和所表现的愿望，都含有直接干涉匈牙利内政的企图。我必须直率地说，帝国主义国家的代理人在匈牙利为所欲为的时代是永远过去了。最近在匈牙利领土上空发现和截获了许多气球，上面装有美国制造的仪器、无线电收报机和发报机，这是放出来进行军事侦察的气球。匈牙利政府抗议这种侵犯匈牙利的自由和独立和威胁匈牙利安全的挑衅行动，并且坚决地要求停止这种行动。
    赫格居斯在讲到8国华沙条约的时候着重指出，匈牙利政府特别重视社会主义阵营国家之间的合作。它还认为，这种合作不论过去和现在，都是国际局势进一步良好发展和巩固和平的最重要的因素之一。匈牙利政府坚决相信，目前是存在着进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际合作的实际可能性的。
    赫格居斯着重指出，我们希望用全力促进裁军问题的解决，我们将参加以巩固欧洲和世界和平和安全为目的的一切国际活动。我们希望根据和平共处和互不干涉内政、互相尊重主权的原则，同一切国家进行合作。
    国民议会经过讨论后，通过了赫格居斯的报告和匈牙利政府在华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会布拉格会议上的工作。
