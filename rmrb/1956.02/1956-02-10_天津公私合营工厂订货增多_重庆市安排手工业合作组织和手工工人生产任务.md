Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th - The 35 newly established industrial specialized companies in Tianjin have successively received large orders from the state and are now distributing production tasks in a planned manner according to the production capacity of each joint public-private factory.

The orders received by the five machinery industrial companies and the electrical appliance company include double-wheeled double-shared plows, boiler engines, and generators needed to support increased agricultural production; as well as drilling rigs, electric winches, etc., needed to supply national construction. These specialized companies have already distributed most of the products according to the machinery, equipment, and technical conditions of their respective factories, and some factories have already begun trial production or are making technical preparations. The orders and processing tasks accepted by specialized companies for cultural and educational supplies, glass products, and rubber have increased significantly this year. The production of 46 kinds of cultural and educational supplies, such as ink, mimeograph machines, and fountain pens, which had poor sales last year, will generally increase by 20% to 60% this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th - Handicraft production cooperatives and production groups in Chongqing have received a large number of orders. The total value of orders received so far is more than double the production performance of the fourth quarter of last year. Among them, there are large quantities of improved waterwheels, powder spreaders, threshing machines, and cultural supplies needed by farmers.

In order to lead the various handicraft production cooperative organizations to complete this arduous production task, Chongqing has established seven specialized production joint associations for metal ironwork, wood and bamboo, and cultural and educational supplies. The municipal handicraft management department has adopted the method of on-site grouping for handicraft households that have been approved but do not have time to be immediately absorbed into the old cooperatives, and quickly organizes them to produce, in order to gradually understand the situation in combination with production and carry out expansion work; for a small number of industries that have been investigated and determined not to need centralized production for the time being, such as sewing and shoe repair, the original decentralized production form is still maintained. The handicraft management department has also sent a large number of cadres to specifically help various handicraft industries to comprehensively carry out production and technical planning. At the same time, a large number of planers, lathes, and other machines are prepared to help some of the older cooperatives with a better foundation to gradually implement mechanical production.

    天津公私合营工厂订货增多
    重庆市安排手工业合作组织和手工工人生产任务
    新华社天津9日电　天津市新成立的35个工业专业公司先后接到了国家的大批订货，并且正在按照各公私合营工厂的生产能力有计划地分配生产任务。
    5个机械工业公司和电器公司接到的订货中，有支援农业增产需要的双轮双铧犁、锅驼机、发电机；有供应国家建设需要的钻探机、电动卷扬机等。这些专业公司已经按照所属各厂的机器设备和技术条件，把大部分产品分配下去，有的工厂已经开始试制或进行技术准备。文教用品、玻璃制品、橡胶等专业公司，今年接受的订货和加工任务大大增加。去年销路较差的墨水、油印机、钢笔等46种文教用品，今年一般都要增产20％到60％。
    新华社重庆9日电　重庆市手工业生产合作社和生产小组已经接到大批订货。目前接到的订货总值比去年第四季度的生产实绩增加了一倍多。其中农民需要的改良水车、撒粉器、打谷机和文化用品等数量很大。
    为了领导各手工业生产合作组织完成这一繁重的生产任务，重庆市已经成立了金属铁作、木竹、文教用品等7个专业生产联社。市手工业管理部门对已经批准但还来不及马上吸收入老社的手工业户，采取就地编组的办法，迅速组织他们生产，以便结合生产逐步摸清情况，进行扩社工作；对已经调查清楚并确定一时不需要集中生产的少数行业如缝纫、补皮鞋的手工工人，仍然维持原来分散生产的形式。手工业管理部门还派了大批干部，具体地帮助各手工业行业全面进行生产和技术的规划。同时准备了大批刨床、车床等机器，帮助一部分基础较好的老社逐步实行机械生产。
