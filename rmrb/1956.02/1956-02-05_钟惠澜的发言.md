Mr. Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:

    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo's report on intellectuals, and the reports of Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen and Chen Shutong, President Dong Biwu, and Vice-President Chen Boda.

    Over the past few months, a high tide of socialist transformation and construction has been surging across the country. Not only have many regions basically entered socialist society, but since the Party Central Committee published the draft National Agricultural Development Program, it has more specifically indicated that the victory of socialism nationwide is just around the corner. This situation fills everyone with joy and increases everyone's sense of responsibility for socialist construction. Therefore, it cannot help but make everyone deeply feel that the level of ideological understanding is far behind the development of the objective situation. In the rapid progress of the motherland's socialist construction, it is natural for various tasks to fall short of objective needs. However, at the current stage, the most prominent manifestation is that science is too far behind the development of politics and the economy, especially natural science. Therefore, the Party and Chairman Mao's decision to eliminate the four pests and eradicate the various diseases that most seriously harm the people, as well as the instruction to bring China's most urgently needed scientific departments close to the world's advanced level within 12 years, are very correct and timely; otherwise, they will affect the speed of the socialist revolution, so it is also a political task that must be completed.

    This glorious and arduous task must fall on the shoulders of our country's scientists. However, most of our country's scientists are old intellectuals. Under the long-term influence of bourgeois education and bourgeois society, not only is the technical level unable to keep up with the needs of the development of the situation, but more importantly, the ideological level is prominently lagging behind reality. Conversely, the backwardness of the ideological level inevitably affects the rapid improvement of the technical level. From this, it can be seen that the transformation of old intellectuals has become a key issue for whether the motherland can reach the world's advanced level in science in the shortest possible time. The rapid transformation of old intellectuals is not only required by the objective situation, but also the common subjective desire of scientists caused by the objective environment. This desire has reached a strong degree.

    Regarding the understanding of the correctness of the Party and Chairman Mao's policy on the transformation of intellectuals, and the suggestions and opinions in specific work, I agree with the content of the articles written by Mr. Hua Luogeng and Mr. Mao Yisheng recently published in the People's Daily, so I will not repeat them. However, different business natures must also have slight differences in understanding. As a medical science worker, I would like to briefly talk about this aspect.

    Since liberation, the Party and the government have educated me politically and cared for me in life through various means. The same situation is also reflected in the hospital where I work and in the various activities of the Chinese Medical Association, which makes me feel trusted in everything and warmed everywhere. It also made me go from ignorance to a preliminary understanding in politics, and to have no worries in life. What makes me even more grateful is the leadership and support of the Party and the government in my work. For example, when the Party and the Ministry of Health agreed to my research on an occupational disease transmitted by rodents to farmers last summer (leptospirosis, also called Weil's disease, or hemorrhagic jaundice leptospirosis), the Party organization and administration of the Guangdong Provincial Health Department proposed guarantees that there would be manpower, equipment, and research materials; the Party organization and administration of the specific working hospital gave huge support to this work in the manner of the central task of the whole hospital. As a result, the achievements made in three months were unattainable in the past three or four years. There are many similar examples. These vivid and touching facts are dreams that could not be encountered in the old society. Therefore, I have full confidence, and I am also willing to guarantee that the tasks assigned to me in the 12-year plan for medical science will definitely be completed resolutely. This belief is not a verbal response to the call, but through the above examples, I deeply realize that the great power generated by the new social system is incomparable to the old society, and it also makes me deeply realize that as long as we rely on the Party, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Achieving Chairman Mao's instructions of more, faster, better, and more economical has its huge realistic possibilities. The key lies in the degree of our subjective efforts.

    In addition, I also feel that my political and theoretical understanding is very poor. This situation is reflected in many aspects. Politically, my understanding of policies is not deep enough, and in business, my learning from the Soviet Union and from traditional Chinese medicine is very insufficient. In the past few years, my own improvement in political understanding has been mainly obtained through the perceptual knowledge of specific work and social reform movements. Because I rarely have time to read political theory books, let alone study them carefully, I cannot quickly raise some of the perceptual knowledge I have learned to rational knowledge. This state is not conducive to ideological transformation. In this regard, I am very envious of some young working comrades, their opportunities are much better than mine. The formation of this situation is mainly due to insufficient subjective efforts, and it is also a shortcoming that should be strengthened in the future. However, objectively, the busyness of work and the lack of time to calm down and study theoretical books is also a factor. In addition to the general reasons that have been put forward, there is also a special situation among medical workers, which is the grand rounds of patients. At present, when the level of medicine in our country is still relatively low, in order to solve the difficult problems in the diagnosis or treatment of patients, the method of grand rounds can gather everyone's wisdom, which is appropriate and indeed solves many problems, but there are also some situations where the responsible doctor has done everything that the modern medical level can do, but the experts and professors are invited to grand rounds in order to meet the patient's requirements. Soviet experts are also often invited, but this consultation cannot solve more problems for the patient. The experts participating in a consultation are at least three or four people, and as many as ten or more people. The time spent is at least two or three hours, and as long as four or five hours. As a result, a lot of time is spent, which is of no benefit to the patient. I think such time can be saved. Therefore, I hope that the leadership will help us arrange not only the necessary business working time, but also a certain amount of political theory study time. Political theory study is also an indispensable part of the transformation of intellectuals.

    Finally, I am willing to intensify my transformation through actively striving, and work with everyone to complete one of the Party's socialist revolutionary undertakings, all the tasks given to us in medical science.

    钟惠澜的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告、郭沫若副主席关于知识分子问题的报告，和李济深副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武院长以及陈伯达副院长的报告。
    几个月来，社会主义改造和建设的高潮在全国范围内汹涌澎湃地开展着，不但在许多地区已经基本上进入了社会主义社会，自从党中央公布了全国农业发展纲要草案以后，更具体地指明，社会主义在全国范围内的胜利是指日可期了。这种形势，使每一个人欢欣鼓舞，使每一个人增加了对社会主义建设的责任感。因此也就不能不使每一个人深刻地感到思想认识水平远远落后于客观形势的发展。在祖国社会主义建设的迅速进程中，各种工作都会发生赶不上客观需要的现象，是很自然的事。但是在目前阶段中，表现得最突出的，就是，科学距离政治与经济的发展太远了，其中尤其以自然科学为甚。因此党与毛主席关于除四害和消灭危害人民最严重的各种疾病的决定，以及要在12年内使我国最急需的科学部门能够接近世界先进水平的指示，是非常正确的，适时的；不然就会影响社会主义革命的速度，所以也是必须要完成的一项政治任务。
    这项光荣而艰巨的任务一定要落在我国科学家们的肩上，可是我国的科学家们大多数是旧知识分子，在长期的资产阶级教育和资产阶级社会的影响下，不但是技术水平赶不上形势发展的需要，更重要的是思想水平突出的落后于现实，反过来思想水平的落后也必然影响着技术水平的迅速提高。由此可见旧知识分子的改造问题，就成为祖国对于在最短期间能否在科学上达到世界先进水平的有关键性的问题了。旧知识分子应当迅速改造，不但是客观形势的要求，也是客观环境所引起的科学家们的共同主观愿望，这种愿望已经达到了强烈的程度。
    关于党和毛主席对于知识分子改造政策正确性的体会，和具体工作当中的建议和意见，我是同意最近在人民日报发表的华罗庚和茅以升两位先生所写文章的内容，所以不再重复，可是不同的业务性质，也一定在体会上有所小异的部分，作为一个医学科学工作者，我愿意就这一方面简单的谈几句。
    解放以来，党和政府通过各种方式，对我在政治上进行教育，在生活上给予关怀。同样的情况也表现在我具体工作的医院中和中华医学会各种活动的过程中，使我事事感到信任，处处得到温暖。也使我在政治上从无知到了有初步的认识，在生活上毫无后顾之忧。更使我感激的是在工作中党和政府的领导和支持。举例来说，在去年夏季党和卫生部同意我研究一种鼠类所传染农民的职业病（钩端螺旋体病，又叫外耳氏病，或叫出血性黄胆钩端螺旋体病）的时候，在广东省卫生厅的党组织和行政就提出保证，要人力有人力，要器材有器材，要研究材料有研究材料；在具体工作医院的党组织和行政更将这项工作按照全院的中心任务的方式给与巨大的支援。结果在三个月内所取得的成绩是过去三、四年所做不到的。同样事例还有许多，这样生动的感人肺腑的事实，是旧社会作梦也遇不到的。因此我有充分的信心，同时也愿提出保证，在医学科学12年规划中所交给我的任务一定能够坚决的完成。这种信念不是口头上的响应号召，而是通过以上的事例，使我深深地体会到，新的社会制度所产生的巨大力量是旧社会所不能比拟的，更使我深深的体会到，只要依靠党是没有不能克服的困难。做到毛主席指示的又多，又快，又好，又省，是有其巨大的现实可能性存在着，关键是在于我们主观努力的程度。
    另外，我也感觉到自己的政治理论认识是很贫乏的，这种情况表现在多方面，在政治上对政策体会不深，在业务上学习苏联和学习中医都很不够。几年来我自己的一些政治认识的提高主要是通过具体工作和社会改革运动的感性认识所取得，由于很少有时间看看政治理论书籍，更谈不到仔细的钻研，所以不能将所体会的一些感性认识很快地上升到理性认识，这种状态是不利于思想改造的。在这一方面我倒很羡慕一些青年的工作同志们，他们的机会比我好得多。这种情形的形成，主要是自己的主观努力不够，也是今后应当加紧克服的缺点。可是在客观上工作的忙乱，很少有时间能够安下心来研究一下理论书籍也是一个因素。造成忙乱现象的原因，除了一般已经提出来的以外，在医务工作者还存在着一种特殊情况，就是病人的大会诊。在目前我国医学水平还比较低的时候，为了解决病人的诊断上或治疗上的疑难问题，大会诊的方法可以集思广益，是适当的而且也的确解决了许多问题，可是也有一部分情况，所负责的医生已经做到了现代医学水平所能做到的一切，只是为了满足病人的要求而邀请了专家教授大会诊，苏联专家也常常是被邀请之列，可是这种会诊并不能给病人解决更多的问题。一次会诊中所参加的专家们少则三、四人，多至十数人，所用的时间少则二、三小时，多至四、五小时；结果花费了很多的时间，对病人并无裨益。我认为像这样的时间是可以节省下来的。因此很希望领导上帮助我们安排一下，不但能有必要的业务工作时间，而且也应有一定的政治理论学习时间，政治理论学习，也是知识分子改造中所不能容忍疏忽的一环。
    最后，我愿意通过主动争取的方式，加紧改造自己，同大家一道来完成党的社会主义革命事业之一，医学科学方面所给我们的一切任务。
