(According to Xinhua News Agency)

    Anhui Province has formulated a plan to fully implement agricultural production reform this year. According to this plan, the land in Anhui Province that will be converted to grow high-yield crops such as rice, potatoes, corn, and Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes will reach approximately 60 million mu, and the land adopting the three-crop-a-year system will reach 15 million mu.

    In order to realize this plan, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have built more than 130,000 farmland water conservancy projects and accumulated more than 120 billion jin of fertilizer. Agricultural and grain departments in various regions have prepared all the seeds needed for the conversion of approximately 60 million mu of high-yield crops and are now transporting them. Supply and marketing cooperatives and transportation departments in various regions have transported more than 15,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows, disc harrows, seeders, and large quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to rural areas.

    Anhui Province has been promoting three measures in agricultural production for more than two years: diversifying summer-harvested crops, high-yield crops, and drought-resistant and water-resistant crops; converting dry land into paddy fields according to local conditions; and changing the habit of extensive planting and low yield. Last year, the area where the three reforms were implemented accounted for one-quarter of the total cultivated land area in the province, increasing grain production by 2.74 billion jin.

    安徽今年将全面实行生产改革
    安徽省已订出今年全面实行农业生产改革的计划。按照这个计划，安徽省今年改种水稻、马铃薯、玉米、胜利百号甘薯等高产作物的土地，将达到6，000万亩左右，采用一年三熟制的土地将达到1，500万亩。
    为了实现这个计划，各地农业生产合作社已经兴修了农田水利工程13万多处，积肥1，200多亿斤。各地农业部门和粮食部门已经把改种6，000万亩左右的高产作物所需的种子筹备齐全，现在正在调运。各地供销合作社和运输部门已经把15，000多部双轮双铧犁、圆盘耙、播种机和大批的化学肥料、农药等运到农村。
    安徽省在农业生产上推行的多种夏收作物、高产作物和耐旱耐水作物，因地制宜把旱地改为水田，以及改变广种薄收习惯等三项办法，已经有两年多的历史。去年全省推行三项改革的面积已经占总耕地面积的四分之一，增产粮食达27.4亿斤。
