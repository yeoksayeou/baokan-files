    Asking the U.S. Government to Return Our Relatives
    Letters from Readers
    Wang Zhongding, father of Wang Dalian, writes:
    My son, Wang Dalian, went to the United States to study in 1948. He first studied in the International Trade Department of the University of Denver, where he obtained a master's degree. Later, he entered New York University. In a letter in March 1951, he said that he missed his motherland and his family and loved ones, and hoped to return to China as soon as possible to contribute his strength to the country. However, since then, he has not written for three or four years.
    My wife and I are both over 70 years old. How can we not miss our son? Especially my wife, who looked forward to his return day and night, shedding countless tears, and often calling out our son Dalian's name in her dreams. Because of excessive longing, she fell ill and passed away in January of last year. On the day before her death, she was still asking if Dalian had written and when he would be able to return. I could only hold back my tears and comfort her, saying that he would be back soon.
    Now, Dalian's mother has been dead for almost a year, but I am still waiting for Dalian's return alone. Since seeing in the newspaper that the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks had reached the first agreement, I was very happy. I have written several times, urging my son to strive to return to China as soon as possible, so that he can fulfill his desire to serve the people and reunite with his family. However, there has been no news so far. I think it must be that the U.S. government is withholding letters and creating obstacles, leading to the interruption of news, which has made me shed old tears frequently. Recently, after seeing your newspaper publish many letters from family members of students studying in the U.S. asking the U.S. government to return their relatives, I personally wrote the above situation and sent it to you, and requested the government to nominate Wang Dalian at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial meeting to bring about the reunion of my father and son as soon as possible.

    Lu Zhiwei and Liu Wenduan, parents of Lu Zhuoru, write:
    Our son, Lu Zhuoru, went to the United States at the end of 1946 to study nuclear physics at the University of Michigan. Before and after liberation, we received letters from him frequently, but in April or May 1952, news suddenly stopped. Our children in Beijing have sent him more than 20 letters, but none have been answered. Last spring, the whole family wrote another long letter and sent it to the alumni office of the University of Michigan for forwarding. But the letter was returned, marked "unclaimed." Last summer, we learned that Mr. Du Lianyao was about to return to China, so we asked him to contact Zhuoru. Mr. Du Lianyao brought back Zhuoru's address, which was clearly at the University of Michigan. Since then, we have sent three more letters, telling him that the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks have reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning to their countries, but still no news.
    From 1950 to 1952, Zhuoru's letters often mentioned wanting to return to China. His last letter in April 1952 said: "... The most infuriating thing is that the plan to return to China cannot be carried out at all. I originally planned to finish the experiment in September last year and go home at the end of the year for the Chinese New Year, but unexpectedly, in August, the U.S. government suddenly changed its plan. Before, it had been trying to force the Chinese to return to China as much as possible. Seeing that the new Chinese government welcomed students studying abroad to return to participate in construction, it suddenly ordered that students in science and engineering should be prohibited from returning to China. In August, a group of returning students had already obtained exit permits and were escorted back to the United States from Hawaii. Currently, anyone studying science and engineering (not to mention nuclear physics), if found to have left the United States without permission, will face two years in prison and a fine of $5,000. All relatively active Chinese students are subject to interrogation by the Immigration Bureau..." Before this, Zhuoru himself had been persecuted by the U.S. Immigration Bureau simply because he was a负责人 (person in charge) of the Chinese Students Science Workers Association in the Midwest of the United States.
    The persecution of Chinese students by the American imperialists is unreasonable. I am 65 years old and work at the Academy of Sciences. We are eager for Zhuoru to return to China. Therefore, we want to lodge a serious protest with the U.S. government and request the government to help Zhuoru get rid of the difficulties created by the U.S. government as soon as possible and return to China to participate in construction.

    Xiang Hengfang, father of Xiang Silu, writes:
    I have been reading many letters in the newspaper asking the U.S. government to return our relatives. These letters express the feelings of resentment towards the U.S. government from many families whose relatives are detained in the United States, persecuted, and threatened and unable to return to China, and also express my feelings of resentment, because I also have relatives who are innocently detained in the United States.
    I am 63 years old and work in the Ministry of Light Industry. My second daughter, Xiang Silu, went to the United States to study in 1944 and received a doctorate in bacteriology from the University of Illinois in 1947. She has worked in laboratories in hospitals in various cities in the eastern and western United States. My son-in-law, Wu Jingzhen, went to the United States in 1944 and received a doctorate in geology from the University of Chicago in 1949. After the liberation of the whole country, they wanted to return to China. My daughter even sent books back, but according to her letters, because the U.S. government "does not allow Chinese students studying science and engineering to leave the country," they had to wait for an opportunity to "make plans for their return."
    Year after year, the parents at home are waiting anxiously, and the bitterness and bad mood of my daughter and son-in-law can also be seen in the words of their letters over the years. After the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning to their countries in September last year, our whole family was filled with the belief that our dear daughter, son-in-law, and three grandchildren born in a foreign country, whom we have been separated from for 10 years, would soon be able to return to the embrace of the motherland and reunite with their families. Therefore, our whole family, young and old, repeatedly wrote letters expressing our welcome and urging them to start their journey back to China as soon as possible. In a letter they sent from Chicago in October last year, they said: "After receiving your letter, we are filled with thoughts, and our hearts are set on returning..." Since then, there has been no news. Although the family has been constantly writing letters to inquire, there is still no news.
    Is it because my daughter and son-in-law's reply expressed "our hearts are set on returning" and they made some preparations for returning to China in action, that they have been persecuted by the U.S. government? Otherwise, family letters have never been interrupted in the past (note: my daughter used to send one or two family letters every month). Why has communication been cut off now?
    From my daughter's past letters, it can be seen that her spirit is very painful. For example, in one letter she said: "When you go out, all you see are people of color." She also said: "The current situation is very bad," and so on. Sometimes, she even showed some signs of mental disorder. Why would this make a vigorous young woman who is studying science so angry, so negative, and so distressed? It is not difficult to imagine that this is caused by the persecution of the U.S. government.
    I strongly protest against the U.S. government's despicable behavior of not abiding by the agreement and persecuting Chinese students. At the same time, I request our government to name names at the Geneva Conference and demand people from the U.S. government, so that the detained Chinese students (including my daughter and son-in-law) can return to the motherland quickly and safely.

    Zhao Yusheng, younger brother of Zhao Zhongyun, writes:
    My brother, Zhao Zhongyun, went to the United States in 1948 and entered the Department of Economics at Iowa State University, later transferring to the Department of Mathematics. After graduating in 1951, he entered the Graduate School of Iowa State University for further studies and obtained a master's degree. In 1955, he entered the Graduate School of the University of Michigan.
    His letters always revealed his longing for the motherland and his family, and he also hoped to return to China to serve the country. But he was not able to return freely. In his letter on August 15 last year, he said: "The U.S. government very much wants us to stay in the United States. We are people who insist on returning to China, which makes them unhappy, so they give us a lot of difficulties. For example, they want us to apply to the Taiwan government for an entry permit, on the grounds that we are unwilling to stay in the United States permanently... So they force us to apply to Taiwan for an entry permit, otherwise they will not let us complete our studies..."
    As a relative of a student studying abroad, I fully support the government's position at the Geneva Sino-U.S. ambassadorial meeting. I express my indignation and protest against the U.S. government's failure to implement the agreement, and at the same time, I will never allow the U.S. government to send my brother to Taiwan!
    Wuhan　Zhao Yusheng
    Zeng Quanliang, younger brother of Zeng Guangzhi, writes:
    Since the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning to their countries, we have been looking forward to our relatives returning to China as soon as possible. However, due to the U.S. government's unreasonable obstruction and failure to implement the agreement, many Chinese students who want to return to China day and night are still unable to return to the motherland and reunite with their families. My brother is one of the thousands.
    My brother, Zeng Guangzhi, went to the United States in 1947 to specialize in medicinal chemistry. He first entered the University of Maryland, and later transferred to Ohio State University. In a letter in 1952, he said that he would return to China immediately after completing his studies. But he has been graduated for two or three years, but still has not returned to China, obviously due to the persecution and obstruction of the U.S. government. In his New Year's card to my sister recently, he wrote: "For many years, I have been plagued by poverty and illness. Due to debt relations, I cannot return to China. The U.S. side advises me to apply for permanent residency." From these few words, it can be seen that his residence in the United States is not voluntary, but is subject to artificial obstacles. Therefore, I request the government to assist so that my brother can return to the motherland as soon as possible and serve the cause of socialist construction.

    向美国政府要回亲人
    读者来信
    王大濂的父亲王仲鼎来信
    我儿子王大濂1948年到美国留学。他先在丹佛尔大学国际贸易系念书，得硕士学位。后又进纽约大学。1951年3月他来信说，他怀念祖国，想念家庭和爱人，盼望能早日回国，把自己的力量贡献给祖国。但自此以后，三、四年之久不来信了。
    我同我的妻子，都是70以上的人，怎么不思念儿子呢？尤其是我的妻子，朝朝夕夕的盼望，眼泪不知流了多少，梦中也常呼唤着儿子大濂的名字，她因为思念过度，竟在去年一月份一病不起。临死前一天，还在问大濂来信没有，究竟几时可以回来。我只好忍泪安慰她，说快回来了。
    如今大濂的妈死去快周年了，可是我还孤独地在盼望着大濂的归来。自从在报上看到中美大使级会谈达成第一项协议后，使我非常高兴。我曾几次去信，催促我儿子争取早日回国，既可达到为人民服务的愿望，又可和家人团聚。可是至今杳无音讯。我想必定是美国政府扣留信件、横生阻碍，以致消息中断，使我老泪频添。近来看到你报多次登载留美学生家属向美国政府要回亲人的信件，我才亲笔将上面情况叙述寄上，并请求政府在中美大使级会议上提名要回王大濂，使我父子早日团聚。

    陆卓如的父母陆志韦和刘文端来信
    我们的儿子陆卓如，1946年底去美国，在密执安大学学核子物理学。解放前后都经常有信来，可是到了1952年四、五月，忽然音讯断绝了。我们在北京的儿女给他去过20多封信，都没有回信。去年春天，全家又写了一封长信，寄密执安大学校友课转交。但信给退回来了，上批“无人招领”。去年夏天，我们知道杜连耀先生快回国了，托他跟卓如联系。杜连耀先生带回来卓如的地址，明明是在密执安大学。此后我们又一连去了三封信，告诉他中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题已经达成协议，但至今仍然信息杳然。
    从1950年至1952年，卓如来信时常提到要回国。1952年4月他最后的一封信说：“……其中最令人生气的是回国计划全不能行。我本预备去年9月作完试验，年底回家过年，不料8月间美国政府突然改变计划，以前是一直尽可能迫令中国人回国，后来看见新中国政府欢迎留学生回国参加建设，就突然下令禁止理工科学生回国。8月间有一批回国学生已经得到出境许可，到了夏威夷又被押解回美。目前一切学理工的（核子物理更不必说了），如果私自离美被发现后，要坐牢二年，罚款5，000美元。一切比较活动的中国留学生都要被移民局盘问……”。在此以前，卓如本人就受过美国移民局的迫害，只因为他是美国中西部中国留学生科学工作者协会的一个负责人。
    美帝国主义者对中国留学生的迫害是毫无情理可言的。我年已65岁，在科学院工作，我们思念卓如回国心切。为此，我们要向美国政府提出严重抗议，并请求政府帮助卓如早日摆脱美国政府的留难，回国参加建设。
  　北京　陆志韦　刘文端
    项斯鲁的父亲项衡方来信
    接连在报上读了许多向美国政府要回亲人的信。这些信道出了许许多多有亲人被扣留在美国、受迫害和威胁而不能归国的家属们对美国政府愤恨的心情，也道出了我的愤恨的心情，因为我也有亲人，无辜地被扣留在美国。
    我现年63岁，在轻工业部工作。我的二女儿项斯鲁，1944年去美留学，1947年得伊利诺斯大学细菌学博士，曾在东西美各城市医院担任化验工作。女婿吴景桢1944年去美，1949年得芝加哥大学地质学博士。全国解放后，他们就想回国，我女儿并曾将书籍寄回，但据来信，因美国政府“不准学理工科的中国留学生离境”，只得等待机会，“再作归计”。
    一年复一年，家中父母望眼欲穿，而我的女儿和女婿心情的苦闷和恶劣，也可以从他们历次来信的字里行间看出。去年9月，中美大使级会谈关于双方平民回国问题达成协议后，我们全家满以为久别10年的亲女儿、女婿以及在异国诞生的3个外孙，一定可以很快回到祖国怀抱，与家人团聚。因此，我们全家老少都以愉快的心情接二连三地去信表示欢迎，并催他们早日动身回国。去年10月间他们从芝加哥发来的信说：“接到来信，感想万端，我们归心如箭……”此后即音讯断绝，虽然家中不断去信催询，也无消息。
    是不是因为我的女儿、女婿的回信作了“归心似箭”的表示，在行动上作了某些归国的准备，因而遭到了美国政府的迫害呢？否则过去家信从未中断，（按，我女儿过去每月都有一封到两封家信寄来。）为什么现在会音讯断绝呢？
    从我女儿过去的来信中，可以看出她的精神是很痛苦的。比如她在一封信中说：“出得门来，所看见的，无非是有色人种”。又说：“现在处境甚为恶劣”等语。有时还露出有些神经失常的情况。为什么会使一个朝气勃勃的研究科学的女孩儿这样气愤，这样消极和苦恼呢？不难想像，这是由于美国政府迫害所造成的。
    我强烈抗议美国政府这种不遵守协议和迫害中国留学生的卑劣行为，同时我要求我国政府在日内瓦会议上指名向美国政府要人，使被扣留的中国留学生（包括我女儿和女婿）能够迅速地安全地返回祖国。

    赵中云的弟弟赵矞生来信
    我哥哥赵中云，1948年去美国，进依阿华州立大学经济系，后转数学系。1951年毕业后，又进依阿华州立大学研究院研读，得硕士学位。1955年他又进密执安大学研究院。
    他的来信随时都流露了对祖国和家人的怀念，同时也很希望回国为祖国服务。但是他没有能够自由地回国。他去年8月15日来信说：美国政府是非常的要我们这批人留在美国。我们是坚持要回国的人，这是他们不高兴的，于是给我们很多的困难。譬如说，要我们向台湾政府请求入境证，理由是我们既不愿永久在美，……所以逼我们向台湾请求入境证，不然不让我们完成学业……”。
    作为一个留学生亲人的我，完全拥护政府在日内瓦中美大使级会议上的立场。我对美国政府不执行协议表示愤慨和抗议，同时绝不能允许美国政府把我的哥哥送到台湾去！
    武汉　赵矞生
    曾广植的弟弟曾权量来信
    自从中美大使级会谈达成关于双方平民回国问题协议后，我们就一直盼望着我们的亲人早日回国。可是由于美国政府无理阻挠和不履行协议，致使许多日夜想回国的中国留学生，至今还不能返回祖国和家人团聚，我哥哥也是数千人中的一个。
    我哥哥曾广植，1947年去美国，专修医药化学。初进马利兰大学，后转俄亥俄州立大学。1952年来信说，学成之后当即回国。但他毕业至今已有二、三年，仍然没有回国，显然是受着美国政府的迫害和阻挠的缘故。他最近给我姐姐的贺年片中写道：“连年以来，贫病交加，因债务关系，不能回国，美方劝告申请居留权”。从这短短的几句话里，可以看出他的居住美国，不是出于自愿，而是受到了人为的障碍。因此，我请求政府协助，使我哥哥能早日返回祖国，为社会主义建设事业服务。
