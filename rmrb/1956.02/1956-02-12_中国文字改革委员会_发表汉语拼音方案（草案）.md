Xinhua News Agency, 10th - The China Written Language Reform Committee published the "(Draft) Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" and "Several Explanations Regarding the Formulation of the (Draft) Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" on the 9th. This (Draft) Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has now been agreed upon by the State Council to be sent by the China Written Language Reform Committee to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the political consultative committees of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to organize discussions from February to March. The China Written Language Reform Committee will make necessary revisions to this draft based on the opinions raised by various parties during the discussions, and then submit it to the State Council for promulgation.

For more than four years, the China Written Language Reform Committee has conducted comprehensive and systematic research on the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and has received more than 600 phonetic schemes sent from various provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and foreign countries. In February 1955, the China Written Language Reform Committee established the Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Committee, composed of Ding Xilin, Wang Li, Ye Laishi, Wu Yuzhang, Zhou Youguang, Luo Changpei, Lin Handa, Hu Yuzhi, Ni Haishu, Wei Que, Lu Zhiwei, and Li Jinxi, to specifically engage in the discussion and formulation of the phonetic alphabet scheme. By the end of 1955, the (Draft) Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme was completed. In January of this year, this draft was amended and approved by the plenary meeting of the China Written Language Reform Committee.

    新华社10日讯　中国文字改革委员会9日发表了“汉语拼音方案（草案）”和“关于拟订汉语拼音方案（草案）的几点说明”。这个汉语拼音方案（草案），现在已经国务院同意由中国文字改革委员会送请中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和各省、市、自治区政治协商委员会从2月到3月分别组织座谈讨论。中国文字改革委员会将根据讨论中各方面所提的意见，对这个草案作必要的修改，然后提请国务院公布。
    4年多来，中国文字改革委员会对于汉语拼音方案进行了多方面的有系统的研究，并且先后收到全国各省、市、自治区和国外寄来的600多种拼音方案。1955年2月，中国文字改革委员会设立了拼音方案委员会，由丁西林、王力、叶籁士、吴玉章、周有光、罗常培、林汉达、胡愈之、倪海曙、韦悫、陆志韦、黎锦熙组成，专门从事拼音方案的讨论和拟订工作。到1955年年底，汉语拼音方案（草案）拟订完成。今年1月，这个草案经中国文字改革委员会全体会议修正通过。
