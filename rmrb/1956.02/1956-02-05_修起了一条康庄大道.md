    A Broad and Smooth Road Has Been Built
    Editor:
    In the past, the roads in Datong Township, Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, leading to nearby market towns were as winding and uneven as field ridges. Whenever it rained, the roads became so muddy that there was nowhere to put your feet.
    In the autumn of 1955, Datong Township was cooperativized. All 20 agricultural production cooperatives in the township universally expanded production investment and planned to buy a large number of farm tools and chemical fertilizers. However, how could they transport things in time on such roads? Everyone was worried about this problem.
    At this time, the Party branch conveyed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, which mentioned repairing bridges and roads. Everyone jumped for joy. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the township farmers discussed the road construction problem. In December 1955, with agricultural production cooperatives as the backbone, more than 1,400 people in the township spent a day and a half to build a broad and smooth road more than four li long and nine chi wide. The road surface was also covered with three inches of coal cinder. By the time spring arrives, 2,000 plane trees will be planted along the road.
    Now, the people of Datong Township are no longer afraid to go out. Township cadres can already ride bicycles on the main road to meetings in the county and district. Jin Jinsheng, a member of the Third Cooperative of the Fourth Village, said happily: "Tractors will soon be driving into our village on this road."

    修起了一条康庄大道
    编辑同志：
    过去，江苏省常熟县大同乡通往附近集镇的道路都跟田塍一样地弯弯曲曲，高低不平；每逢下雨天，路更烂得连落脚的地方都没有。
    1955年秋天，大同乡合作化了。全乡20个农业生产合作社普遍扩大了生产投资，计划要买大量的农具和化学肥料。但是，在这样的路上，怎么能及时地把东西运进来呢？大家都为这个问题感到发愁。
    就在这个时候，党支部传达了党中央和毛主席的指示，其中提到了修桥补路这一条。大家都高兴得跳起来。在党支部领导下，全乡农民讨论了修路问题。1955年12月，以农业生产合作社为骨干，全乡1，400多人用一天半时间就修好一条四里多长、九尺宽的康庄大道。路面上还铺上了三寸厚的煤屑。等到开春，沿路将要种上2，000棵梧桐树。
    如今，大同乡的人们不再害怕出门了。乡里的干部到县里、区里开会，已经可以骑上脚踏车在大路上疾驰。四村第三社社员金金生高兴地说：“拖拉机不久就会从这条路上开到我们村里来。”熊煌
