The work of assigning and purchasing pigs has been widely launched in 18 major pig-producing provinces and cities. In Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Heilongjiang and other provinces, more than 200 counties and cities have assigned the annual or semi-annual pig assignment and purchase tasks to agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers at each level.

In order to do a good job in pig assignment and purchase, the commercial and agricultural departments of many provinces, special zones, and counties have organized working groups to go deep into the countryside to publicize to farmers the importance of raising more pigs for improving agricultural production, supplying urban needs, and national exports. In order to encourage the majority of farmers to raise pigs, various regions have taken care of pig-raising farmers in terms of supplying feed and other aspects. Some areas have also helped farmers train breeders, solve the problem of piglet supply, and strengthen veterinary epidemic prevention and other work.

At present, agricultural production cooperatives and farmers in various regions are raising a large number of pigs. Hebei Province will increase the number of pigs raised this year by one time compared with last year. In Hunan Province, the 459 agricultural production cooperatives in Xiangtan County alone will raise 33,595 more pigs this year than last year.

    各地积极开展生猪派养派购工作
    今年的生猪派养派购工作已经在18个主要产猪省、市广泛展开。浙江、河南、湖北、湖南、黑龙江等省，已经有200多个县、市将全年或上半年的生猪派养派购任务逐级布置到农业生产合作社和个体农户。
    为了作好生猪派养派购工作，许多省、专区和县的商业和农业部门组织工作组，深入农村向农民宣传多喂养生猪对于提高农业生产、供应城市需要和国家出口的重要意义。为了鼓励广大农民养猪，各地在供应饲料等方面都对养猪农民加以照顾。有些地区还帮助农民训练饲养员，解决仔猪供应问题，并且加强兽医防疫等工作。
    目前，各地农业生产合作社和农民正在大量地养殖生猪。河北省今年养猪头数将比去年增加一倍。湖南省仅湘潭县459个农业生产合作社，今年就要比去年增养生猪33，595头。
