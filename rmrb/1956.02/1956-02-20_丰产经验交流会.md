    Bumper Harvest Experience Exchange Meeting
      In January, the Huaiyin Special District of Jiangsu Province held an agricultural production experience exchange meeting, which greatly promoted the current production preparation work.
    At this meeting, typical bumper harvest experiences were summarized, and the key to local agricultural production increase and the main methods for increasing the yield of various crops were identified. Farmer representatives with less bumper harvest experience saw practical examples of bumper harvests at this meeting; farmer representatives with more bumper harvest experience also learned from each other at this meeting, further enriching their production knowledge.
    This exchange meeting used many facts about bumper harvests to break the right-leaning conservative thinking of local leaders. The leading personnel of the district party committee clearly saw the great potential of agricultural production in the district and effectively revised the original production increase plan.
    A natural result of this meeting was the upsurge of bumper harvest competitions among many agricultural production cooperatives. Because this competition was carried out on the basis of exchanging experiences, helping each other, and promoting each other, it was relatively easy to avoid falling into formalism.

    丰产经验交流会
      1月间，江苏淮阴专区举行了一个农业生产经验交流会，对当前生产准备工作起了很大推动作用。
    在这次会议上，总结了典型的丰产经验，找到了当地农业增产的关键和各种作物增产的主要方法。丰产经验比较少的农民代表在这次会上看到了实际的丰产榜样；丰产经验比较多的农民代表在这次会上也互相学习，更加充实了生产知识。
    这次交流会，用许多丰产事实，打破了当地领导方面的右倾保守思想。地委的领导人员明白地看到了本区的农业生产有很大潜力，切实地修正了原定的增产计划。
    这次会议的一个自然的结果是掀起了许多农业生产合作社之间的丰产竞赛。因为这竞赛是在交流经验、互相帮助、互相推动的基础上开展起来的，比较容易避免流于形式主义。
