　　A number of advanced workers from the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory, Dalian Machine Tool Factory, Yingkou Paper Mill, and Dalian Shipbuilding Company have completed their individual workloads for the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

　　Su Guangming, a milling worker, and Zhang Zhigui, a fitter, from the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, completed their individual workloads for the first Five-Year Plan in mid-January and late-January this year, respectively. Recently, the two workshops to which they belong jointly held a conference to congratulate them. Su Guangming is a veteran milling worker with over 20 years of experience. In recent years, he has improved 12 tools, promoted multi-machine management and high-speed cutting and other tool methods, increasing production efficiency by an average of 1 to 2 times. He also combined tire-shaped tools and high-speed cutting, two advanced experiences, to process axle bushes, increasing work efficiency by more than 10 times. Fitter Zhang Zhigui is also a veteran technical worker with 17 years of experience. After he earnestly implemented the fitter assembly line operation and sub-section operation method in 1955, he increased production efficiency by an average of more than 1 time throughout the year, and there were no rejects. Now Su Guangming and Zhang Zhigui have made a guarantee that they will complete 8 years of workload in 5 years.

　　Workers in the Sun Yongcai group of the forging workshop of the Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory are now carrying out production for 1958. This group completed five years and two months of production quotas in three years and twenty days. In recent years, the workers of this group have actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and mastered many new technologies. The third-level technical workers in the group can do the work of fifth and sixth-level technical workers. In the past 3 years, the workers in the group have realized 37 major rationalization proposals, increasing production efficiency by more than 1.5 times.

　　Workers in the bed body group of the foundry workshop of the Dalian Machine Tool Factory are now carrying out production for the fourth quarter of 1958. In recent years, the workers of this group have earnestly adopted the suggestions of Soviet experts, established assembly line operations and professional division of labor systems in the three processes of mold repair, box covering, and box punching, and promoted the advanced experience of standard sprues. They have also put forward 52 rationalization proposals and found tricks in 3 years, which has increased production efficiency by 4.4 times.

　　The employees of the papermaking workshop of the state-owned Yingkou Paper Mill completed the production quota for the first Five-Year Plan two years and eight days ahead of schedule. The employees of this workshop actively promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in their work, and at the same time improved the operating methods of adding glue to the felt and separating pulping, increased the round net cage of the paper machine, and increased the photosensitive roller and pressing lever, etc., so that the speed of the No. 2 paper machine was increased from 30 meters to 52 meters, and the speed of the No. 3 paper machine was increased from 72 meters to 95 meters.

　　A female worker group in the second section of the anchor chain of the steel casting workshop of the Dalian Shipbuilding Company completed the production quota for the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule on January 14 this year. Among the 12 female workers in this group, 11 have already become mothers. In the past few years, the female workers of this group have not been absent from work without reason. They have earnestly studied the advanced experience of the Soviet "combined die jig modeling method," which has increased production efficiency by 40% to 80%.

    哈尔滨、大连、营口等地的一批先进工人
    提前完成五年计划期间的个人工作量
    本报讯　哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂、大连工矿车辆厂、大连机床厂、营口造纸厂和大连造船公司的一批先进工人，已经提前完成了第一个五年计划期间的个人工作量。
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂铣工苏广明和钳工张执贵，在今年1月中旬和下旬分别提前完成了第一个五年计划期间的个人工作量。最近，他们所在的两个车间曾联合举行大会来祝贺他们。苏广明是一个有20多年工龄的老铣工。几年来，他改进了12件工具，推行了多机床管理和高速切削等车刀法，使生产效率平均提高1倍到2倍；他还把胎型工具和高速切削两种先进经验结合起来加工轴瓦，使工作效率提高10倍多。钳工张执贵也是一个有17年工龄的老技术工人。他在1955年认真执行了钳工流水作业和分部作业法以后，全年平均提高生产效率1倍多，而且没有出过一件废品。现在苏广明和张执贵又提出保证，要在5年内完成8年的工作量。
    大连工矿车辆厂锻造车间孙永财小组的工人现在正在进行1958年的生产。这个小组在三年零二十天中完成了五年零两个月的生产定额。这个小组的工人几年来积极学习苏联先进经验，掌握了许多新技术，组内三级技术工人都能干五、六级技术工人的活。3年来全组工人实现了37件较大的合理化建议，提高生产效率1倍半以上。
    大连机床厂翻砂车间床体小组的工人现在正在进行1958年第四季度的生产。这个小组的工人几年来认真采纳了苏联专家建议，在修型、盖箱和冲箱三道工序上建立了流水作业和专业分工制度，推广了标准水口先进经验；他们又在3年中提出合理化建议和找到窍门52件，使生产效率提高了4.4倍。
    国营营口造纸厂造纸车间的职工提前两年零八天完成了第一个五年计划的生产定额。这个车间的职工，在工作中积极地推广苏联先进经验，同时改进了毛布加胶和分开打浆的操作方法，加大了抄纸机的圆网笼，增加了感光辊和压榨杠杆等，使二号抄纸机的速度由30公尺提高到52公尺，三号抄纸机的速度由72公尺提高到95公尺。
    大连造船公司铸钢车间锚链二段的一个女工小组，在今年1月14日提前完成了第一个五年计划的生产定额。这个小组的12个女工中，有11个人已经做了妈妈。这个小组的女工几年来没有一个无故欠勤的，她们认真学习苏联“连套胎具造型法”的先进经验，使生产效率提高40％到80％。
