The State Council has issued instructions on vigorously promoting Mandarin Chinese among the Han people nationwide and has decided to establish a Mandarin Chinese Promotion Working Committee as the unified leading body for this work. This is an important step in strengthening the unification and development of our country in the political, economic, defense, and cultural fields.

Over 90% of the people in our country speak Chinese. Chinese is the language with the largest number of speakers in the world, and it is also one of the most developed languages in the world. However, due to historical reasons, Chinese has not yet achieved complete unification today. There are serious dialectal differences in Chinese, especially in pronunciation. Not only are there great differences in language between different regions, but even between different counties in the same province. This phenomenon of divergence and confusion not only weakens the role of Chinese as a communication tool and hinders the smooth development of the language itself, but is also detrimental to the cause of socialist construction and the further reform of our written language. Therefore, it is necessary to promote Mandarin Chinese, which takes Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation, the Northern dialect as the basic dialect, and exemplary modern vernacular works as the grammatical norm, and to strengthen the work of standardizing Chinese in the cultural, educational, and publishing systems.

Whether the task of promoting Mandarin Chinese can be completed quickly and effectively nationwide depends on whether Party and government organizations at all levels and all relevant departments attach sufficient importance to this work, whether they can make comprehensive and specific plans for the work that should be done in their respective regions and departments, and whether they can strengthen leadership and supervision.

Schools at all levels are the most important bases for promoting Mandarin Chinese. The Ministry of Education has decided to begin teaching Mandarin Chinese in primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools nationwide starting in the autumn of 1956. Chinese language teachers in the first grade of primary school, the first grade of junior high school, and Chinese language teachers in normal schools should receive training in Mandarin Chinese pronunciation before the summer vacation of 1956. Other teachers who need to receive centralized training should complete their training by 1958. There is only half a year left before the start of the autumn semester, and all localities must seize the time to carry out this work. Graduating students from secondary schools and universities across the country in 1956 who cannot yet speak Mandarin Chinese should receive short-term remedial classes. Provincial education departments should compile booklets to guide people in their provinces to learn Mandarin Chinese based on the characteristics of their local dialects in 1956. The Chinese language teaching in schools at all levels and the curriculum of Chinese language departments in universities should also be improved and strengthened accordingly. In the near future, every secondary school graduate should be able to speak good Mandarin Chinese and write fluent articles; every university graduate should have a rich knowledge of Chinese (primarily modern Chinese), and graduates from Chinese language departments should be able to take responsibility for promoting the standardization of Chinese in positions such as language teaching, text editing, and language research.

The cultural departments also bear a major responsibility for promoting Mandarin Chinese and promoting the standardization of Chinese. Radio, film, and drama have a large audience, and they should become the most powerful tools for spreading Mandarin Chinese. As for the standardization of written language, it should first be the responsibility of the national news and publishing institutions. It must be ensured that the language used in radio broadcasts, on the screen, on the stage, or in publications is healthy and conforms to the norms.

The People's Liberation Army is another important base for promoting Mandarin Chinese. After the implementation of the military service law, military life itself requires a unified language. Promoting Mandarin Chinese in the military helps to enhance the highly centralized and unified combat power of the People's Liberation Army and is of great significance for the modernization of national defense. Each batch of soldiers who have completed their service and returned to their localities also bring Mandarin Chinese to all parts of the country.

Youth League members across the country should become a shock force in learning and promoting Mandarin Chinese. Youth League branches in various localities should cooperate with various League activities to promote Mandarin Chinese among young people in appropriate ways.

The study of Mandarin Chinese should be actively promoted among the workers of large-scale factories and construction sites and among the staff of the national railway, transportation, postal and telecommunications, health, public security, judicial, news, and other systems.

In order to do a good job in promoting Mandarin Chinese and promoting the standardization of Chinese, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen scientific research on Chinese. The Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should organize the strength of linguists nationwide to vigorously carry out scientific research on Chinese. A standard pronunciation dictionary and teaching materials for basic knowledge of standard pronunciation should be compiled in 1956, and a preliminary survey of the dialects of every county in the country should be completed by 1957 in conjunction with the normal colleges and Chinese language departments of comprehensive universities across the country. We should also quickly begin to study the wording, writing, usage, and other issues of modern Chinese vocabulary, and compile various dictionaries and teaching materials based on the results of the research. This is the glorious responsibility of all linguists in our country.

In order to effectively teach Mandarin Chinese, there must be a set of scientific phonetic alphabets. After a long period of research, the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee has formulated a draft Chinese phonetic scheme and submitted it to all sectors of society for discussion. After this set of phonetic alphabets is determined, it can be used to annotate Chinese characters, to spell Mandarin Chinese, and to compile and print various phonetic readers of Mandarin Chinese to help teach Mandarin Chinese and expand its dissemination. This phonetic scheme is not yet a phonetic writing system, but it can be used to conduct various experiments in phonetic writing in order to solve some difficult problems in the process of the phoneticization of Chinese characters. This scheme can also be used as a basis for ethnic minorities in our country to formulate phonetic writing systems and as a tool for learning Chinese. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly determine this scheme after discussion and revision.

As long as the people across the country who speak Chinese work together to promote Mandarin Chinese, we believe that we can achieve great success in the development of our country's language and writing in a not-too-long period of time.

### 努力推广普通话

    努力推广普通话
    国务院发布了在全国汉族人民中大力推广普通话的指示，并且决定了设立推广普通话工作委员会，作为这一工作的统一领导机关。这是一个加强我国在政治、经济、国防、文化各方面统一和发展的重要步骤。
    我国有90％以上的人民说汉语。汉语是世界上使用人数最多的语言，同时也是世界上最发达的语言之一。但是由于历史的原因，汉语今天还没有达到完全统一。汉语中有严重的方言分歧，特别表现在语音上。不仅是这个地区和那个地区之间，甚至在同一个省的这个县和那个县之间，人们的语言都有很大分歧。这种分歧和混乱的现象，不仅削弱了汉语作为交际工具的作用，阻碍了汉语本身的顺利发展，而且对于社会主义的建设事业和我国文字的进一步改革也都不利。因此，必须推广以北京语音为标准音、以北方话为基础方言、以典范的现代白话文著作为语法规范的普通话，并且在文化、教育、新闻、出版系统中加强汉语规范化的工作。
    推广普通话的任务能否在全国范围内迅速地、有效地完成，关键在于各级党政组织和各个有关部门对于这一工作是否充分重视，对于本地区和本部门应该做的工作能否作出全面的具体规划，并且加强领导和检查。
    各级学校是推广普通话最重要的基地。教育部已经决定从1956年秋季起，在全国小学中学和师范学校开始教学普通话。全国小学一年级和初中一年级的语文教师和师范学校的语文教师，在1956年暑假以前，都要受到普通话的语音训练。其他需要集中受训的教师，应该在1958年受训完毕。现在距离秋季开学只有半年的时间，各地必须抓紧进行这一工作。全国中等学校和高等学校1956年的应届毕业生，如果还不会说普通话，应该进行短期的补课。各省教育厅应该在1956年内，根据本省方言的特点，编出指导本省人学习普通话的小册子。各级学校的汉语教学和高等学校语文系的课程也应该有相应的改进和加强。在不久的将来，每一个中等学校毕业生都应该能够说很好的普通话，写出通顺的文章；每一个高等学校毕业生都应该对汉语（首先是现代汉语）具有丰富的知识，而其中语文系的毕业生应该能够在语文教学、文字编辑、语言研究等工作岗位上负责促进汉语的规范化。
    文化部门对于推广普通话和促进汉语规范化也负有重大责任。广播、电影和戏剧拥有广大的听众和观众，它们应该成为传播普通话的最有力的工具。至于书面语言的规范化，首先应该是全国新闻出版机构的责任。必须做到，无论是广播中的语言，银幕上的语言，舞台上的语言或者出版物上的语言都是健康的，合乎规范的。
    人民解放军是推广普通话的另一个重要基地。实行兵役法以后，部队生活本身要求有统一的语言。在部队中推广普通话，有助于发挥人民解放军高度集中统一的战斗力量，对于国防现代化的建设有重要意义。每一批服役期满的兵员退役，回到各个地方，也就把普通话带到了全国各个地方。
    全国的青年团员应该成为学习和推广普通话的突击力量。青年团的各地支部，应该配合团的各项活动，以适当方式在青年中间推广普通话。
    在大规模的工厂和工地的职工中，在全国铁路、交通、邮电、卫生、公安、司法、新闻等等系统的工作人员中，都应该积极提倡学习普通话。
    为了做好推广普通话和促进汉语规范化的工作，必须大力加强对于汉语的科学研究工作。中国科学院语言研究所应该组织全国语言学家的力量，大力开展汉语的科学研究工作。应该在1956年内编好普通话的正音词典和正音基础知识的教材，并且在1957年以前，会同全国各地师范学院和综合大学语文系的力量完成全国每个县的方言的初步调查工作。还应该迅速着手研究现代汉语词汇的说法、写法、用法等问题，根据研究的结果编成各种词典和教材。这是我国全体语言学家的光荣责任。
    为了有效地进行普通话的教学，必须有一套科学的拼音字母。中国文字改革委员会经过长期的研究，拟定了一套汉语拼音方案草案，提交社会各界人士讨论。这一套拼音字母在确定以后，就可以用来给汉字注音，可以用来拼写普通话，编印各种普通话的拼音读物，来帮助教学普通话和扩大它的传播。这个拼音方案还不就是拼音文字，但是有了它就可以用来进行拼音文字的各项试验，以便解决汉字拼音化过程中的若干困难问题。这个方案还可以用来作为我国少数民族制定拼音文字的基础和学习汉语的工具。因此，经过讨论和修正，迅速地确定这个方案，是必要的。
    只要全国说汉语的人民共同努力来推广普通话，我们相信，一定可以使我国语言文字的发展在一个不太长的期间得到伟大的成效。
