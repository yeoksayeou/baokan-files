Strengthening the Overall Perspective, Opposing Localism

Recent work inspections in various industrial sectors have revealed that many units and enterprises, due to a lack of an overall perspective and handling the relationship between the part and the whole, between one unit and another, according to localist ideology, have caused some serious damage to China's industrial production and capital construction. The progress of construction in some units has been delayed, the speed of production has slowed down, and the quality of products has also deteriorated. From the several typical examples published in this newspaper today, we can see how serious the harmful effects of localist thinking are on industrial production and capital construction.

The ideology of localism is essentially a bourgeois ideology, which is fundamentally incompatible with China's socialist economic laws. The characteristic of this ideology is to put the interests of one's own enterprise or department in opposition to the interests of the entire country, even at the expense of the interests of the entire country, or intentionally or unintentionally harming the interests of other enterprises or departments, for the sake of the interests of one's own enterprise or department. Enterprise leaders who suffer from localism are only willing to be responsible for the partial interests of their own enterprise, and are unwilling to be responsible for the overall interests of the country, or for the interests of other related enterprises; they are only willing to be responsible for current interests, and are unwilling to be responsible for long-term interests. Influenced by the bourgeoisie, they adopt capitalist management methods, harming the interests of the state and the people to achieve their own enterprise's profitability; they falsely report and embezzle, obtain funds through deception, conceal errors, resist criticism, falsely report achievements, and fraudulently obtain rewards; they only care about simply pursuing output, arbitrarily lower product quality standards, cut corners, produce shoddy goods, pass off inferior goods as good goods, pass off waste products as finished products, deceive users, and deceive the people. On the issue of cooperation between enterprises, they either refuse to cooperate, fantasizing about working alone, fantasizing about being "omnipotent"; or they only unilaterally demand that others cooperate with them, and they are unwilling to cooperate with others; or they reluctantly accept cooperation tasks, but do not actively organize forces to work hard, so that they often cannot complete cooperation tasks with quality, quantity, and on time. What is particularly serious is that a "buck-passing" atmosphere of mutual obstruction has formed between certain enterprises, and some so-called "buck-passing experts" have appeared in certain enterprises. For the sake of the interests of their own unit, they try their best to use various opportunities to push their own difficulties to others and shift their responsibilities to the other party; they often engage in endless arguments over some non-principle issues, and even lead to some enterprises preferring workers to be idle and equipment to be idle, and refusing to cooperate, or delaying the progress of the project, which is an intolerable phenomenon.

People who suffer from the disease of localism are unwilling to understand that the relationship between socialist enterprises is neither a competitive relationship between capitalist enterprises, nor a divided relationship of individual economies, but a cooperative and mutually supportive relationship in completing common tasks. Here, some enterprises depend on other enterprises, and other enterprises depend on still more enterprises, relying on each other and closely linked. Any enterprise is only a part of the entire national economic structure, and any enterprise's destruction of cooperation will inevitably cause losses to other related enterprises. Our country not only requires that the internal organization of each enterprise be very good and the cooperation be very good, but also requires that the organization and cooperation between various enterprises be very good. As Lenin said, the great task of socialist construction is to "turn the entire state economic apparatus into a single large machine, into an economic body that makes hundreds of millions of people work according to a single plan." Localism and decentralism are related to each other, so people with serious localist thinking are often those who make trouble with lack of organization and discipline. These people often undermine national plans, violate national policies, are uneasy in the position of a "screw," and are unwilling to obey the leadership of superiors; they always inappropriately emphasize the importance of the local work they manage, and always hope to make the overall interests subordinate to their local interests, so the mistakes of some people have developed to the point of making independence and creating independent kingdoms.

From this, it can be seen that localism, ideologically undermining the overall concept, organizationally hindering centralization and unity, and economically harming the responsibility system, economic accounting, and cooperation system, this kind of thinking objectively plays a destructive and harmful role in China's socialist industrialization and the development of the socialist economy. Some leaders of industrial departments and some leaders of local party committees, seeing localism, do not criticize and correct it, and some even help to promote the development of localism. This is completely wrong. This is a serious manifestation of right-leaning conservatism in leadership and a serious manifestation of abandoning ideological leadership.

The decisive key to overcoming localism lies in strengthening leadership. Industrial departments and local party committees at all levels should set an example and take the lead; they should resolutely and unswervingly, clearly and unambiguously, stand on the position of advocating the overall concept and opposing localism. They should first completely eliminate their own localism and handle all related issues between their own department and other departments from the perspective of taking care of the overall situation. When relationships occur between units under their own department and units under other departments, they should warn the cadres and workers under their own department, strictly require their own units, and actively take care of the units under others.

Industrial departments and local party committees at all levels should conduct a thorough inspection in their affiliated units and regions, resolutely correct all manifestations of localism, quickly resolve various disputes that affect industrial production and industrial construction, and should summarize experience and lessons from this, and gradually establish and improve the rules and regulations for the division of responsibilities in enterprise management. The formulation and supplementation of such rules and regulations are of great significance for improving the management of socialist enterprises and promoting the development of the socialist economy. It is necessary to seize this current urgent task and solve it. Because as long as we solve this task, we can greatly reduce the phenomenon of disputes caused by incomplete rules and regulations and unclear division of responsibilities. At the same time, it can also ensure that the struggle against localism can be guaranteed by rules and regulations. However, it should be pointed out that the best system also relies on people to implement it. If an enterprise leader does not have the communist spirit of self-awareness and does not have an overall concept, any complete system will be corrupted by their hands. On the contrary, as long as enterprise leaders have the communist spirit of self-awareness, even if the system is not yet complete, they will actively cooperate with other enterprises in their work to complete tasks; and in practice, they will also gradually improve the incomplete system according to the needs of the cause.

Therefore, in addition to formulating necessary rules and regulations based on practical experience, the task of leadership is to constantly conduct communist education to cadres and the masses, advocating taking care of the overall situation and taking care of the majority; advocating mutual support, mutual assistance, mutual cooperation, and mutual creation of conditions; advocating treating the difficulties of the other party as one's own difficulties, and treating the affairs of others as one's own affairs, not only taking care of oneself and not taking care of others, not "digging a canal to drain one's neighbor's field," and "shifting the blame to others." It is necessary to cultivate a new social public opinion, advocate a new moral standard, so that people with the communist spirit are respected, and people with localist ideas are criticized. For this purpose, the leadership should implement some appropriate rewards and punishments, that is, reward those individuals and units that act in accordance with the overall concept, and punish those individuals and units that act in accordance with localism. Both parties who actively cooperate should be rewarded; both parties who shirk each other should be criticized. If both Party A and Party B can do something, Party A actively does it, and Party B shies away from it, Party A should be rewarded and Party B should be criticized. If Party A should do something but does not do it, and Party B actively undertakes it, Party B should be rewarded and Party A should be punished; the funds and equipment used by Party B in this matter should be ordered by Party A to be fully returned. Any party should be responsible for helping the other party complete the tasks assigned by the superior and implement the instructions of the superior. For matters that the superior has not instructed, they should promptly ask the superior for instructions while actively cooperating with the work, and are not allowed to put down their work and engage in disputes. When negotiating a contract, both parties should not only think for themselves, but also think for the other party at the same time; but after the contract is signed, both parties should strictly fulfill their obligations under the contract and should not shirk their due responsibilities.

Some people raise the question: Does advocating the overall concept and opposing localism mean canceling disputes? There are various kinds of disputes. One kind of dispute is that both parties proceed from partial interests and persistently engage in disputes on some non-principle issues in order to unilaterally safeguard partial interests. This is a harmful dispute. There is also a kind of dispute in which one party or both parties proceed from the overall interests and engage in disputes on some principle issues in order to safeguard the overall interests. This is a beneficial dispute. The current situation is that there are too many disputes of the former kind and too few disputes of the latter kind. Therefore, it should be to reduce the former kind of disputes and increase the latter kind of disputes (nor should it hinder work). Seeing that others have made localist mistakes, just because they are afraid of offending people, afraid of ruining relationships, and afraid of losing votes in elections, and not criticizing them and waging struggles against them, this is liberalism. Without overcoming this liberalism, correct disputes are impossible to unfold.

Generally speaking, the situation that there are more of the former kind of disputes is closely related to the low political level and one-sided ideological methods of these comrades. These comrades have short-sightedness, only seeing the current affairs and not seeing the more distant affairs, their minds are narrow, they can only accommodate the things around them and cannot accommodate more things; but within the scope of their responsibilities, they are still diligent and honest in their work. This kind of localism derived from ideological understanding is different from the kind of localism linked to bourgeois individualism. People with bourgeois individualism often regard the units they lead and the achievements of their units as personal capital. In order to achieve personal goals, they do not hesitate to adopt means of attacking others, elevating themselves, hindering others, and developing themselves. Therefore, a differentiated approach should be adopted to deal with these two different kinds of localism. The former kind of localism must of course be criticized, but the main thing should be to strengthen their ideological education and improve their political and ideological level. As for the latter kind of localism, in addition to criticism and education, appropriate punishments should also be given; and for those whose circumstances are particularly bad, they should be severely punished according to law, so that those who are heading towards this path can wake up early and turn back quickly.

### 加强整体观念，反对本位主义

    加强整体观念，反对本位主义
    各工业部门最近的工作检查告诉我们，不少单位和企业由于缺乏整体观念，而按照本位主义思想去处理局部和整体、这一单位和那一单位的关系，使我国的工业生产和基本建设受到了一些严重的损害：有些单位的建设进度推迟了，生产速度降低了，产品质量也变坏了。从本报今天所发表的几个典型例子中，我们可以看到，本位主义的思想，对于工业生产和基本建设是有多么严重的危害作用。
    本位主义思想，本质上是一种资产阶级的思想，它同我国社会主义的经济法则是根本不相容的。这种思想的特点就是要把本企业、本部门的利益同整个国家的利益对立起来，甚至为了本企业、本部门的利益，而不惜牺牲整个国家的利益，或者有意无意地损害其他企业、其他部门的利益。犯有本位主义毛病的企业领导人，只愿对本企业的局部利益负责，不愿对国家的整体利益负责，不愿对其他有关企业的利益负责；只愿对当前利益负责，不愿对长远利益负责。他们接受资产阶级的影响，采取资本主义的经营方法，损害国家和人民的利益，来实现自己的企业赢利；他们虚报冒领，套取资金，隐瞒错误，抗拒批评，谎报成绩，骗取奖励；他们只顾单纯地追逐产量，擅
  自降低产品质量标准，偷工减料，粗制滥造，把次货当好货，把废品当成品，蒙混用户，欺骗人民。在企业间的协作问题上，他们或者拒绝协作，幻想单干，幻想“全能”；或者只片面地要求别人给自己协作，自己不愿给别人协作；或者勉强接受协作任务，但不积极地组织力量努力工作，以致常常不能按质、按量、按期地完成协作任务。特别严重的是某些企业之间形成了一种相互刁难的“扯皮”风气，某些企业中出现了一些所谓“扯皮专家”，他们为了本单位的利益，尽量利用各种的机会，把自己的困难推给别人，把自己应负的责任卸给对方；他们为了一些非原则的问题，往往进行没有休止的争论，甚至因此发生了某些企业宁愿工人窝工，设备闲置，而拒绝协作，或推迟工程进度的不可容忍的现象。
    犯了本位主义毛病的人不愿懂得，社会主义各企业之间的关系，既不是资本主义企业的竞争关系，也不是个体经济的分割关系，而是在完成共同任务上的合作关系和互助关系。在我们这里，一部分企业依赖着另一部分企业，而另一部分企业又依赖着其他更多的企业，彼此互相依赖，密切联系，任何一个企业都只是国家整个经济机构的一部分，任何一个企业对协作的破坏，都必然使其他有关企业受到损失。我们的国家不但要求每个企业的内部能够组织得很好，协作得很好，而且要求各个企业之间也能够组织得很好，协作得很好。正如列宁所说的，社会主义建设的巨大任务就是要“把全部国家经济机构变成一整架大机器，变成一个使几万万人都遵照一个计划工作的经济机体”。本位主义和分散主义是互相联系的，所以本位主义思想严重的人也往往就是闹无组织无纪律的人。这些人经常破坏国家的计划，违反国家的政策，不安于“螺丝钉”的位置，不愿服从上级的领导；他们总是不适当地特别强调他们自己所管的局部工作的重要性，总希望使整体利益去服从他们的局部利益，因而有些人的错误就发展到了闹独立性、搞独立王国的地步。
    由此可见，本位主义，在思想上破坏整体观念，在组织上妨碍集中统一，在经济上损害责任制、经济核算和协作制，这一种思想对我国社会主义工业化和社会主义经济的发展，在客观上起着破坏和危害的作用。有些工业部门的领导，有些地方党委的领导，看到了本位主义，也不去批评和纠正，有的甚至去助长本位主义的发展，这是完全错误的，这是领导上右倾保守的一种严重表现，是放弃思想领导的一种严重表现。
    克服本位主义的决定关键，在于加强领导。各工业部门和各地方党委都应当以身作则，做出榜样；应当坚决而不动摇地，明确而不含糊地站在提倡整体观念，反对本位主义的立场上来。应当首先完全去掉自己的本位主义，从照顾整体的观点出发，去处理本部门和别部门的一切有关问题。在本部门所属单位同别部门所属单位发生关系的时候，应当告诫自己所属的干部和工人，严格要求自己的所属单位，主动照顾别人的所属单位。
    各工业部门和各地方党委应当在所属单位和地区中进行一次深入的检查，坚决纠正一切本位主义的现象，迅速解决各种影响工业生产和工业建设的争执问题，并且应当从中总结经验，研究教训，逐步地把企业管理职责分工的规章制度建立和健全起来。这类规章制度的制定和补充，对于改善社会主义企业的管理，推进社会主义经济的发展，有着十分重要的意义，必须抓紧解决这个当前的紧急任务。因为只要我们解决了这个任务，就可以使那种由于规章制度不完备、职责分工不严密而产生的争执现象大大减少，同时，也可以使反对本位主义的斗争能够得到规章制度上的保证。但是，应当指出，最好的制度也是靠人去执行的。如果一个企业领导人，没有共产主义的自觉精神，没有整体观念，任何完备的制度经过他们的手也是会变坏的。相反的，只要企业领导人具有了共产主义的自觉精神，就是制度还不完备，他们也会在工作中主动地同其他企业相互配合完成任务；而且在实践中，他们也会根据事业的需要，使不完备的制度逐步地完备起来。
    因此，领导上的任务，除开根据实践经验制定必要的规章制度以外，应当经常向干部，向群众进行共产主义的教育，提倡照顾整体，照顾多数；提倡相互支持，相互帮助，相互协作，相互创造条件；提倡把对方的困难当作自己的困难，把别人的事情看作自己的事情，不要只顾自己不顾别人，不要“以邻为壑”，“嫁祸于人”。要培养一种新的社会舆论，提倡一种新的道德标准，使具有共产主义精神的人受到尊敬，具有本位主义思想的人受到批评。为此目的，领导上要实行一些适当的奖励和处分，即奖励那些按照整体观念办事的个人和单位，处分那些按照本位主义办事的个人和单位。对于主动配合的双方，都应当奖励；对于相互推诿的双方，都应当批评。甲乙双方都可以做的事情，甲方主动做了，乙方推脱不干，应当奖励甲方，批评乙方。甲方应该做而不做的事情，乙方积极承担起来了，应当奖励乙方，处分甲方；乙方在这件事上所用的资金器材，应当指令甲方全部归还。任何一方都应当负责帮助对方完成上级交给的任务，实现上级的指示。对于上级没有指示的事情，应当一边及时地向上请示，一边主动地配合工作，不准放下工作，进行争论。在议订合同的时候，双方不但应当为自己设想，也应当同时为对方设想；但在合同签定以后，双方都应当严格履行自己对合同的义务，不应当推卸自己应尽的责任。
    有人提出疑问：提倡整体观念，反对本位主义，是不是要取消争论？有各种各样的争论。一种争论是双方都从局部利益出发，为了片面地维护局部利益而在一些非原则的问题上坚持地进行争论，这是一种有害的争论。还有一种争论是一方或双方从整体利益出发，为了维护整体利益而在一些原则的问题上进行争论，这是一种有益的争论。目前的情况是前一种争论太多，后一种争论太少。因此，应当是减少前一种争论，增加后一种争论（也不应当妨碍工作）。看着别人犯了本位主义错误，仅只因为怕得罪人，怕闹坏关系，怕在选举时丧失选举票，而不向他展开批评，进行斗争，这是一种自由主义。不克服这种自由主义，正确的争论是不可能展开的。
    一般说来，前一种争论较多的这一情况，同这些同志政治水平较低、思想方法片面是有密切关系的。这些同志眼光短小，只看到当前的事情，不看到更远的事情，他们胸怀狭窄，只能容纳身边的东西，不能容纳更多的东西；但是在自己的职责范围内，他们对工作还是勤勤恳恳的，老老实实的。这种来源于思想认识的本位主义，同那种和资产阶级个人主义相联系的本位主义，是有区别的。有资产阶级个人主义的人往往把他们所领导的单位和本单位的成绩当作个人的资本，他们为了达到个人的目的，不惜采取打击别人，抬高自己，妨害别人，发展自己的手段。所以，应当采取区别对待的方针来处理这两种不同的本位主义。对前一种本位主义当然必须批评，但主要的应当是对他们加强思想教育，提高他们的政治思想水平。而对于后一种本位主义，除了也必须进行批评教育以外，还应当给予适当的处分；而对其中情节特别恶劣的，则应当严肃地依法制裁，以便使那些正在向着这条道路走去的人，能够及早警醒，赶快回头。
