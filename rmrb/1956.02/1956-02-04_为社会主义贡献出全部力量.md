    Contribute All Strength to Socialism
    By Our Correspondent Fu Dong
    The lights in the meeting hall suddenly blazed on, the intense, sun-like light shining on the red banner hanging on the rostrum that read "The Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," shining on the glittering gold characters of the brocade banners on both sides of the rostrum that read "Listen to Chairman Mao's words, and forever follow the Communist Party," and also shining on the excited and moved faces of all the committee members and observers.
    At that moment, Chairman Mao appeared on the rostrum. He kindly smiled and waved to everyone.
    The entire venue erupted. A storm of applause resounded through the crowd. People stood up and applauded vigorously, everyone wanting to express their respect, love, and gratitude to Chairman Mao through applause.
    Among them were dozens of engineers from factories, mines, and construction sites. They were so excited that they didn't know how to express their gratitude to the leader. They had endless words they wanted to tell Chairman Mao. It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who led them to complete the work that could not be done in the past few decades in just a few short years. It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who helped them understand the principle of serving the people.
    Li Changyuan, gazing at Chairman Mao's radiant face, recalled many, many things. How much encouragement and strength Chairman Mao's words had given him in his work! He recalled the scene when he was surveying the highway on the Kangzang Plateau. At that time, he was the chief engineer of the Kangzang Highway. In order to find a reasonable route, he and some engineers often climbed up and down cliffs several thousand meters high. There were no roads on the mountains, so they would tie themselves with ropes and hang down, or slide down holding a single-log ladder. When crossing rivers with rapid currents, they would erect rawhide ropes on both banks of the river, and people would slide across the ropes hanging in mid-air. At night, they would sleep in stone caves or under trees. Hungry days were not uncommon, and they sometimes couldn't find anything to eat in the mountains for a day or two. Recalling this, Li Changyuan said that when he slept in the wilderness at minus thirty or forty degrees at night, listening to the howling of the cold wind, he remembered Chairman Mao's words "Serve the People," and he felt full of strength. He thought that soon the Kangzang Highway would be open to traffic, and the Tibetan people would be able to wear good clothes and drink hot tea like the people in the mainland; in the future, large factories and large farms would appear on the land of Tibet, just like in other parts of the motherland... Thinking of these things, he felt an unspeakable joy in his heart, and didn't feel bitter at all.
    He said that the events of the old and new societies cannot be compared, he calculated: After liberation, he worked on the Kangzang Plateau for two years and built 1,250 kilometers of highways, while in the 11 and a half years before liberation, he only built 1,020 kilometers of highways on the plains. Once, he spent two years but still didn't manage to build a 20-kilometer road. In the past, he had suffered countless grievances for building roads, but now, while still building roads, he received the respect of the people.
    Yu Mingyu was even more overjoyed. He was the chief engineer of the Xinjiang "August 1st" Steel Plant. Combining China's specific conditions, he created a new alkaline top-blown converter steelmaking method, which could turn iron ore with a phosphorus content of up to 1.8% into high-quality steel. Originally, to refine high-quality steel from iron ore with such a high phosphorus content, it would be necessary to build an open-hearth furnace, which would cost a lot of money. Now, his steelmaking method not only guaranteed the quality but also reduced costs, and was simple to operate and easy to learn. Like the nearly 100 million tons of high-phosphorus iron ore in the Ma'anshan mining area, the problem could be solved with this method without spending much money. If this method is promoted nationwide, then the value will be great.
    "If this can be considered a small creation, then the credit should be attributed to the Party and the higher-ups," Yu Mingyu said. Without the support of the Party and the higher-ups, this method would not have been tested. He said that before the method was tested at the "August 1st" Steel Plant, the then Secretary of the CPC Branch personally came to the factory to hold a meeting of Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres. After that, the Party organization always supported him in his work. Over the years, the Secretary of the Autonomous Region's Party Committee, the Secretary of the Urumqi Municipal Party Committee, and the负责人 of the Autonomous Region's United Front Work Department often came to the factory to offer condolences and encouragement. Yu Mingyu said: "The words of the Party's leading comrades gave me great encouragement."
    In fact, the steelmaking method was not newly created by him; he had spent three years researching it during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The research was done, but it could not be used. It was not until after liberation that his research results were used in actual work.
    Zhao Qingjie, the chief engineer of the Jiangnan Cement Plant, specialized in metallurgy when he was young. But after returning from abroad, he ran all over Shanghai, Hankou, Beijing, Shenyang, and Benxi, said all the good things, and asked all his friends, but still couldn't find a job. Later, after many twists and turns, he went to Qixin Cement Plant as an engineer, and from then on, he switched to making cement. In 1933, Qixin wanted to set up a cement plant in Nanjing and sent him there. He prepared for 16 years, but the factory had not yet started.
    After liberation, the government called on the workers in the factory to organize and start production. In less than half a year, the factory officially started. The government specially called him to be the chief engineer, allowing him to concentrate on research and production. He discovered volcanic ash rock near the factory, and used this volcanic ash rock to manufacture pozzolan cement, which greatly reduced costs. Talking about the factory's production, Zhao Qingjie said: "Now the motherland is under construction everywhere. Today, harbors and dams are being built here, and tomorrow, factories and bridges are being built there... Cement is needed everywhere, so the factory's production is increasing year by year." Finally, he said this: "I must work hard and do more for the people."
    An Chaojun, the chief engineer of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, thought even more at the meeting. He remembered the scene when the branch meeting accepted him into the Communist Party on December 14 last year. He remembered the Party's cultivation and help to him over the years. He said: "The Party made me recognize myself and made me understand many new truths."
    In the early days of liberation, An Chaojun was the director of the ironmaking department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. At that time, he was quite proud of his work, thinking that cadres and workers "respected" him. When he was on duty, everyone was well-behaved, there was no noise in the office, and no one was late or left early. Of course, he also led by example, burying himself in his desk from morning to night. But he found that the military representative sitting across from him was not like this. The military representative was turning around in the workshop all day long. He was a little puzzled.
    After some time passed, one day the military representative said to him: "The cadres and workers have a lot of opinions but they dare not raise them with you. When you are there, everyone is quiet and doesn't make a sound. As soon as you leave, they start making a lot of noise. Shall we hold a meeting and ask everyone to raise their opinions?" The discussion was held like this. At the meeting, everyone raised a lot of opinions. One worker said: "Engineer An is cold and makes people feel no warmth." This surprised him greatly.
    From then on, people often saw him walking around in the ironmaking department, carefully checking the work, and carefully discussing problems with the workers in the workshop.
    Soon he was promoted to deputy director and chief engineer.
    In September 1952, a hanging material accident occurred in the factory. The situation was very serious. The two Party committee secretaries stayed by the blast furnace day and night to understand the situation. Then they helped him hold a forum with technical cadres and veteran technical workers to discuss solutions. At the meeting, An Chaojun drew a conclusion and proposed measures. The Party committee secretary said: "If you have any opinions, raise them now. If you don't have any opinions, go back and implement them immediately, and you can't discount them." As a result, it only took 12 days to solve the accident. An Chaojun said: "From then on, I no longer had the incorrect idea in my mind that the Party can only lead politics and cannot lead business and technology."
    An Chaojun thus recognized the Party and approached the Party. He worked hard, went deep into the field, he was always early to arrive and late to leave, he was familiar with the factory's production equipment, and he understood the workers' situation. When work was busy, he often didn't sleep for several days. Once, his leg disease broke out and he almost fell from the blast furnace. Returning home late at night, he still seized the time to read, he studied Soviet metallurgical professional knowledge and coking production knowledge. He said to people: "I did not participate in the new democratic revolution, and I must contribute all my strength in the great socialist revolution."
    It was not just one or two engineers who said this, but many. At the subsequent group discussions, they all said: "We must demand ourselves according to the standards of Communist Party members. We must work hard to learn all the good and advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, and the advanced experiences of the world, improve our technology, so that we can catch up with the world's advanced scientific and technological level in more than a dozen years."

    为社会主义贡献出全部力量
    本报记者　傅冬
    会场里的照明灯突然亮起来，那强烈的像太阳光一样的灯光照在主席台上挂着的“中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议”的红色横幅上，照在主席台两旁锦旗上“听毛主席的话，永远跟着共产党走”的闪闪发光的金字上，也照在全体委员和列席代表兴奋激动的脸上。
    就在这时，毛主席出现在主席台上。他亲切地向大伙儿微笑招手。
    整个会场沸腾了。人群中传出暴风雨一样的掌声。人们站立起来，使劲地鼓掌，人人都想通过掌声来表达自己对毛主席的尊敬、热爱和感谢。
    这里面有几十位来自工厂、矿山和建筑工地的工程师。他们兴奋得不知该怎么表示自己对领袖的感激。他们有说不尽的千言万语要想告诉毛主席。是共产党和毛主席领导他们在短短的几年时间里完成了过去几十年所作不了的事业。是共产党和毛主席帮助他们认识了为人民服务的道理。
    李昌源望着毛主席红光焕发的脸，想起了好多好多事情。毛主席的话，在工作中给了他多少鼓舞和力量呵！他回想起在康藏高原踏勘公路时的情景。那时他是康藏公路的总工程师。为了寻找一条合理的路线，他和一些工程师常常在几千公尺高的悬崖上爬上爬下。山上没有路，他们就用根绳子绑着身子吊下去或者抱着个独木梯溜下去。过江碰到水急的时候，他们在河两岸架条牛皮绳子，人顺着吊在半空中的绳子滑过去。夜里就睡在石洞或者树底下。饿肚子的日子也不算少，他们在山里有时一两天都找不到东西吃。李昌源回想到这里说，当他夜里睡在那零下三、四十度的旷野里，听着那寒风在耳边呼啸，他想起了毛主席的“为人民服务”的话，他觉得浑身是力量。他想不久康藏公路通了车，藏族人民就会像内地的老百姓穿上好衣服，喝上热喷喷的茶；将来，西藏的大地上，也会像祖国各地出现一个个大工厂，一个个大农庄……一想到这些，他就觉得心里有说不出的痛快，苦一点儿也不觉得了。
    他说新旧社会的事不能比，他算了算：解放后他在康藏高原上工作了两年，筑了1，250公里的公路，而解放前11年半他在平原上才筑了1，020公里的公路。有一次他花了两年功夫还没有修好一条20公里的路。过去，为了修路，他不知受过多少气，现在，同样是修路，他受到了人民的尊重。
    余名钰喜得更是心花怒放。他是新疆“八一”钢铁厂的总工程师。他结合中国的具体情况，创造了一种碱性边吹转炉新炼钢法。把含磷到1.8％的铁矿炼成优质钢。本来含磷这样高的铁矿要炼优质钢，那就要另建平炉，花很多的钱。现在用他的这种炼钢法既保证了质量，又降低了成本，而且操作简单，很容易学会。像马鞍山矿区近1亿吨的含磷很高的铁矿用这方法不花什么钱就把问题解决了。如果在全国推广这种方法，那价值就大了。
    “如果说，这算是一小点点创造，那功劳应该归于党和上级。”余名钰说，假若没党和上级的支持，是不会试验这法儿的。他说在“八一”钢铁工厂试验这法儿以前，那时的中共分局书记亲自到厂召开党、政、工、团干部会议。以后工作中党组织一直支持他。几年来，自治区的党委书记、乌鲁木齐市的市委书记、自治区统一战线部的负责人常到厂里慰问和鼓励他。余名钰说：“党的领导同志们的话给了我很大的鼓舞。”
    其实要说起这炼钢法并不是他新创的，是他抗战时花了三年功夫研究出来的。研究是研究出来了，但没有能用上。一直到解放后，他的研究成果才在实际工作中得到运用。
    江南水泥厂的总工程师赵庆杰年轻时专门学习冶金。可是从国外回来后，他跑遍了上海、汉口、北京、沈阳、本溪，说尽了好话，托尽了朋友，还是找不到事作。后来经过许多周折，到启新水泥厂做工程师，从此就改行造水泥。1933年启新要在南京办个水泥厂就派他去。他前前后后筹备了16年，工厂还没有开工。
    解放后，政府号召厂里的工人组织起来开工生产。不到半年时光，工厂就正式开了工。政府专门叫他作总工程师，让他专心一意研究生产，他在工厂附近发现了火山灰岩，用这种火山灰岩制造火山灰质水泥，使成本大大降低。谈到厂里的生产，赵庆杰说：“现在祖国到处都在建设，今天这儿建海港、水坝，明天那儿修工厂、桥梁……到处都要水泥，所以厂里的生产一年比一年多。”最后他这样说：“我一定要努力工作，为人民作更多的事。”
    石景山钢铁厂的总工程师安朝俊在会上想得更多。他记起了去年12月14日支部大会接受他加入共产党的场面。他想起这几年党对他的培养和帮助。他说：“党使我认识了我自己，使我明白了好多新的道理。”
    解放初期，安朝俊在石景山钢铁厂作炼铁部的主任。当时他对自己的工作还挺得意，认为干部、工人“尊敬”他，他值班的时候，大伙规规矩矩，办公室没一点闹声，上下班也没一个迟来早退的。当然，他自己也是以身作则的，他从早到晚爬在办公桌上埋头工作。可是他发现坐在他对面的军事代表却不是这样，军事代表成天在车间里转来转去。他有点纳闷。
    这样过了些时，有一天军事代表对他说：“干部工人有好多意见但不敢给你提。你在时，大伙静悄悄地不啃声，你一走，他们就大吵大闹。咱们是不是召开个会，叫大伙提提意见？”座谈会就这样召开了。会上大伙提了不少意见，有一个工人说：“安工程师冷酷，使人感不到一点温暖。”这话使他大吃一惊。
    从此，人们常常看见他在炼铁部走来走去仔细地检查工作，细心地和职工在车间一块商量问题。
    不久他被提升为副厂长兼总工程师。
    1952年9月，工厂发生了挂料事故。情况很严重。两个党委书记日日夜夜守在高炉旁边了解情况。接着又帮他召开了一个技术干部、老技术工人座谈会商量处理办法。会上安朝俊作出结论提出措施。党委书记说：“有意见现在就提出，没意见，回去马上就执行，不能打折扣。”结果只用了12天功夫就把事故解决了。安朝俊说：“从那以后，我思想里就再没有党只能领导政治，不能领导业务、技术的不正确想法了。”
    安朝俊就这样认识了党，靠拢了党。他努力工作，深入现场，他天天都是早来晚走，他熟悉工厂的生产设备，他了解工人的情况。工作忙时他常常好几天不睡觉。有一次他腿病发了，差点没从高炉上摔下来。深夜回到家，他还抓紧时间看书，他研究苏联的冶金专业知识和焦化生产知识。他对人说：“新民主主义革命我没有参加，在伟大的社会主义革命中我一定要贡献出我的全部力量。”
    说这样话的，不是一个两个而是许多个工程师。在以后的小组讨论会上，他们都说：“我们要以共产党员的标准要求自己。我们要努力学习苏联和兄弟国家的一切好的及世界上先进经验，提高自己的技术，使我们能够在十几年内赶上世界先进的科学技术水平。”
