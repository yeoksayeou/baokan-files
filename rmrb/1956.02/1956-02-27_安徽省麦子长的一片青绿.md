    The over 70 million mu of wheat, barley, and rapeseed crops in Anhui Province are a lush green. The wheat planted early has already taken root and sprouted, and is generally growing well. Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in various areas are weeding, applying fertilizer, and strengthening field management. According to incomplete statistics from the three special districts of Wuhu, Anqing, and Lu'an, weeding and fertilizer application have been carried out on over 23 million mu of wheat fields, of which over 5 million mu have been weeded two or three times and fertilized twice. In the two special districts of Fuyang and Anqing, methods such as transplanting seedlings separately and promoting germination for replanting have been adopted to fill the gaps in wheat and rapeseed seedlings.

    安徽省麦子长的一片青绿
    安徽省7，000多万亩小麦、大麦和油菜等作物一片青绿。种得早的麦子已盘根发棵，一般都生长良好。现在，各地农业生产合作社正进行锄草、追肥和加强田间管理。据芜湖、安庆、六安等三个专区的不完全统计，锄草、追肥的麦田已达2，300多万亩，其中锄过两三次草、追过两次肥的就有500多万亩。阜阳、安庆两个专区采用分棵移栽和催芽补种等办法，补全了小麦和油菜的缺苗。（新华社）
