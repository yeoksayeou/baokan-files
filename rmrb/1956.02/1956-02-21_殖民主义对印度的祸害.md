Abolish the colonial system completely, and strive for and safeguard national independence!
    The Evils of Colonialism in India
    By Sen Delar, Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association

    After nearly two hundred years of colonialism and foreign rule, the Indian people finally won political independence not long ago. Their experience can be roughly summarized as follows:

    In the early eighteenth century, India was one of the richest countries in the world economically. Its industrial products were highly priced in foreign markets. At that time, a French traveler named Bernier wrote: "India is a bottomless abyss, and most of the world's gold and silver flow in from all over the world through different channels, but none of it leaks out." At that time, Indian farmers were the richest farmers in the world. But in the early twentieth century, as the British economist William Digby said, at least 100 million people in British India could not eat a full meal in a day. British officials proudly said that the "gradual and universal impoverishment of India" was partly due to the forceful import of British goods that squeezed out Indian goods, thus promoting "the shrinking of wealth in all productive classes." Famines became more and more frequent. The last great famine was in 1943, and nearly 3.5 million people starved to death in Bengal alone. It is estimated that in the second century of British rule in India, no less than 100 million people died of starvation in various famines. In these two hundred years, India was truly "skinned and boned," falling from one of the richest countries in the world to one of the poorest.

    In terms of education, from reliable official documents, we know that before the British occupation, there were 80,000 local schools in Bengal alone, that is, one school for every 400 residents. In every Indian village, all children generally learn to read, write, and do arithmetic. But when the British destroyed the village community system, the rural schools also disappeared. According to the records of the British Parliament, no European country had a higher percentage of literacy than India. But in the two generations under British rule, the percentage plummeted.

    In the mid-nineteenth century, British educational policy presented a new and more abhorrent tendency, adopting measures to instill British education into some Indian youth. Sir Macaulay gave the following reasons for these measures: "We must do our best to cultivate such a class that they can act as translators between us and the millions we rule, a class of people with Indian blood and complexion but with British tastes, ideas, language, and education."

    However, when the British began to rule India, nearly 100% of the people were educated, and when British rule ended, only 7% of the people were educated.

    The cultural progress of the people mainly depends on their increasing unity and solidarity. From the perspective of regional, population, or ethnic, linguistic, religious, and cultural differences, India can be compared with the whole of Europe, except for Russia. From this point of view, India formed a unity of life many centuries ago, which has not yet formed in Europe. Of course, there are class and ethnic differences in India. But even with these significant differences, unity has formed. Like all colonizers, Britain believed that its security lay in expanding and exacerbating these differences and divergences.

    Sir John Malcolm said at the beginning of the nineteenth century: "Now that the territory of our empire has expanded, our security depends on the comprehensive division of this vast society and their division into various classes and tribes." Major General Lionel Smith casually said: "All racial and religious prejudices are the magic weapons we (the British) have always used to control this country—letting Muslims oppose Hindus."

    Therefore, the entire evolution of India was delayed by two centuries.

    Obviously, one of the most important ways for foreign rulers to conquer a nation is to destroy the nation's character. They adopted a divide-and-rule policy, instigating one class to oppose another, persecuting patriots and buying and encouraging traitors, adopting complicated legal systems and corresponding courts, and, in the words of the legislators themselves, using insidious so-called educational systems and thousands of insidious methods "to corrupt the spirit of the natives." The rulers did everything they could to destroy the character of the people.

    I talk about all this only to illustrate how India has tasted the evil consequences of colonialism, which is enough to convince people that there is no greater pain that colonialism or foreign rule can bring to the people. Traces of this brutal disaster still remain on India's body—Goa. India believes that as long as colonialism continues to run rampant in any part of the world, the security of other parts of the world is threatened. That is why free India advocates the resolute abolition of all forms of colonialism—whether military, political, or economic. The Indian people wholeheartedly sympathize with all the people in the world who are fighting for national independence and against foreign interference in their internal affairs. Therefore, the Indian people support the people of Malaya, Indochina, Korea, Japan, the Arab countries, and all those who are striving to abolish colonialism. There can be no lasting peace in the world until this cause is successful.

    The Indian people believe that the great Chinese people will share this feeling. Therefore, the Indian people are willing to establish closer and closer relations with the Chinese people. Our two peoples must work together to strive for the abolition of colonialism and the establishment of true and lasting world peace.

### 殖民主义对印度的祸害

    彻底废除殖民制度，为争取和维护民族独立而斗争！
    殖民主义对印度的祸害
    印度中国友好协会主席　森德拉尔
    经过将近两百年的殖民主义和外国统治之后，印度人民终于在不久以前赢得了政治上的独立。他们的经历概略地说来是这样的：
    在十八世纪初期，印度在经济上是世界上最富庶的国家之一。它的工业产品在国外市场上价格高昂。那时有一位法国旅行家伯奈尔写道：“印度是一个无底深潭，大部分世界上的金银经过不同的途径从各地流来，而却一点也不会漏出去。”那时，印度的农民是世界上最富裕的农民。但是在二十世纪初期，正如英国的经济学家威廉·道比所说的，在英属印度至少有1万万人一天之内吃不上一顿饱饭。英国官吏骄傲地说，“印度逐渐的和普遍的贫困化”部分地是由于英国货强性输入排挤印度货以致促成“各生产阶层的财富的萎缩”的结果。饥荒一次比一次来得频繁，最后的一次大饥荒是在1943年，仅是在孟加拉一地饿死的人就将近350万。据估计，在英国统治印度的第二个世纪中，在历次饥荒中饿死的人总共不下1万万人。在这两百年中，印度真正是被“敲骨吸髓”，从世界上最富庶的一个国家沦落为最贫穷的国家之一。
    在教育方面，从确实可靠的官方文件里，我们知道在英国占领前，仅是在孟加拉一地就有8万所地方学校，这就是说每400个居民有一所学校。在每一个印度乡村里，所有的儿童一般都会读、会写和会算术。但是当英国摧毁了村社制度时，农村的学校亦随之消失了。根据英国议院的记录，没有一个欧洲国家在识字的百分比上是高出于印度的。但是在英国统治下的两代中，百分比急遽下降。
    在十九世纪中叶，英国的教育政策呈现出新的、更加可恶的倾向，采取了向一些印度青年灌输英国教育的措施。麦考利爵士为这些措施提出下面的一些理由：“我们务须尽我们的能力去培养出这样的阶级，他们可以担当我们和被我们统治的千百万人之间的翻译者，一个带有印度血统和肤色而又具有英国的喜好、意念、言语和教养的人的阶级。”
    可是，在英国开始统治印度时，人民当中受教育的几达百分之百，而当英国的统治终止时，人民当中受教育的仅达7％。
    人民在文化上的进步，主要依靠他们的日益统一和团结无间。从地区、人口或是种族、语言、信仰和文化上的差别方面来看，印度可以跟整个欧洲相比，除去俄罗斯以外。由此看来，印度在许多世纪前就已形成了生活上的统一，而这在欧洲来说直到现在也还没有形成。当然，印度有等级和种族之差别。但是即使有这些显著的差别，统一还是形成了。跟一切殖民者一样，英国认为她的安全就在于扩大和加甚这些差别和歧异。
    约翰·马尔柯姆爵士在十九世纪之初曾经说过：“现在我们帝国的版图扩大了，我们的安全系于这个庞大的社会的全面分化和它们的分裂为各个等级和部落。”里昂奈尔·史密斯少将随口说道：“一切种族和宗教上的偏见，就是我们（英国）一直控制这个国家的法宝——让回教徒去反对印度教徒。”
    因此，印度的整个进化被阻延了两个世纪。
    很显然，外国统治者要征服一个民族，最重要的办法之一就是破坏这个民族的特征。他们通过分治政策，唆使一个阶级去反对另一个阶级，逼害爱国者和收买、鼓励叛徒，采用繁杂的法律制度和相应的法庭，以及用立法者自己的话来说，通过毒辣的所谓教育制度以及千百种阴险的方法“去败坏土著人的精神”。统治者尽其所能地摧残人民的性格。
    我所以谈到这一切，只是为了说明印度曾经是如何尝试过殖民主义的恶果，足以使人相信，再没有比殖民地或外国统治给人民带来更大的痛苦。在印度的躯体上仍然残留着这种凶残灾害的痕迹——果阿。印度相信，只要殖民主义仍在世界的任何一个地方上横行霸道，那末世界上其他地方的安全也就受到威胁。这就是为什么获得自由的印度主张坚决废除一切形式的殖民主义——无论是军事上的、政治上的、或是经济上的。印度人民衷心同情世界上所有那些正在为民族独立和反对外国干涉自己的内政的国家的人民。所以，印度人民支持马来亚、印度支那、朝鲜、日本、阿拉伯国家的人民以及所有正在力争废除殖民主义的人们。这个事业一日未成功，世界上就不可能有持久的和平。
    印度人民相信伟大的中国人民会同有此感。因此，印度人民愿与中国人民建立愈来愈加密切的关系。我们两国人民务必并肩协力争取废除殖民主义，建立世界的真正的持久和平。
