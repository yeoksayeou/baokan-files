    苏联出版“回忆马克思和恩格斯”一书
    新华社莫斯科20日电　苏联国家政治书籍出版局出版了由苏联共产党中央委员会马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林研究院编辑的“回忆马克思和恩格斯”文集。
    这本文集中包括了马克思和恩格斯的朋友和同志、马克思的亲人以及其他曾经同他们见过面，谈过话并且向他们学习过的人们所写的回忆录。其中除了已经发表过的材料以外，有些材料还是根据马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林研究院所保存的作者的手稿第一次出版的。这些回忆录中包括燕妮·马克思的“不平静的生活的速写”，特·库诺的“回忆录选辑”，顾格尔曼的“关于伟大的马克思的散记”和克拉夫琴斯卡娅的“回忆选集”等。
    这次出版的一些材料中间，包括第一次译成俄文的威廉·李卜克内西的“关于恩格斯的回忆录”和埃加·朗格的“卡尔·马克思的家庭生活片断”。
    这本书对于研究这两位无产阶级革命理论的缔造者的生活和工作的人们说来，具有很大的意义。这些回忆录表明马克思和恩格斯是天才的学者和伟大的革命家，是为了工人阶级的事业、为了一切劳动人民和被压迫的人们的事业而斗争的顽强的战士。
