Counter-revolutionaries are very interested in people who speak recklessly and are garrulous. Spies and secret agents regard these people as "voluntary informants." They rack their brains, study the psychological state of these people, and try every possible means to find such people, hoping to talk with them and establish "friendships." The American intelligence agency once instructed its agents not to let go of any braggart, "Keep your eyes open at all times to find braggarts." An intelligence agency of an imperialist country, in its instructions to its intelligence personnel, demanded that people who talk recklessly be "categorized," for example, into "ordinary reckless talkers and braggarts, enthusiastically agitated reckless talkers, and innocent reckless talkers."

From this, it can be seen that people who speak recklessly and are garrulous are often good helpers for counter-revolutionaries to steal our Party and state secrets. Unfortunately, such people are still everywhere. In the minds of these people, the concept of enemy situation and the concept of confidentiality are very weak, or even completely non-existent. They talk recklessly about the Party and state secrets regardless of the occasion, time, or object.

There are some people who recklessly talk about Party and state secrets anywhere - in cinemas, restaurants, parks, bathhouses, swimming pools, streets, stations, or carriages. Many people think this way: how could it be so coincidental that there happen to be enemies nearby eavesdropping and memorizing? This idea is extremely dangerous. This is a manifestation of a complete lack of understanding of the complexity and acuteness of the class struggle in our country's transition period. He Zhenya, a Chiang Kai-shek secret agent arrested in Liaoning Province, confessed that he used "casual conversation" to collect important military secrets such as the area, equipment, and completion date of an airport from workers building the airport. Wang Qiuhang, a Chiang Kai-shek secret agent arrested in Fuzhou City, often eavesdropped on conversations between the People's Liberation Army and government cadres in crowds in public places such as cinemas, bathhouses, and bus stations, and obtained much important intelligence, which was "rewarded" by the secret service. Shouldn't those who speak recklessly regardless of the occasion wake up?

There are some people who cannot resist the flattery and compliments of others. If someone praises and compliments them a few words, they will immediately boast and brag incessantly, and state secrets are leaked during this process. The enemy has carefully studied the weaknesses of such people. As written in an instruction from a certain secret service agency: "It is not difficult to force a person to tell his own history. Especially when he has a medal of honor on his uniform, you can ask him how he got it. You pretend to be an attentive listener, and he will talk to you endlessly, and finally he will brag about his army's future plans. Train yourself to be a master at listening to the boasts of those who talk recklessly." Those who like to boast often help the enemy with such cunning tricks. The aforementioned Chiang Kai-shek secret agent Wang Qiuhang tried every possible means to get acquainted with our military personnel in order to spy on local garrison secrets. Once, Wang Qiuhang heard that the local garrison wanted to rent a house, so he took the initiative to help. He finally got to know an administrator of this unit and figured out the administrator's "bottom line" of being arrogant, complacent, and fond of flattery. This secret agent then attacked him: "You are veteran cadres, really not simple!" "The People's Liberation Army has worked hard and made great contributions to the revolution!" This administrator was so dizzy with flattery from the secret agent that he talked endlessly from the life of the troops to the tasks, reorganization, and troop movements. Once he started talking, he never stopped. In this way, the secret agent Wang Qiuhang achieved his goal of probing the military intelligence of a certain unit of the local garrison.

There are some people who are completely open and talk about everything with their old classmates, old comrades, close friends, and family members. This also opens the door for the enemy's secret stealing activities. We must not forget the criminal behavior of the former director of the Factory Affairs Department of the Northeast Railway Bureau, which was revealed in the article "We Must Not Forget This Matter" published in the People's Daily in August 1955. During the most intense days of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, this director sat in the living room and revealed a large amount of extremely important military secrets to a "close relative." This "close relative" was the director's brother-in-law, an old classmate from the past, a member of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Vanguard Team before the Anti-Japanese War, but at that time had become an intelligence officer of the US imperialist spy organization "44th Overseas Observation Team." This secret agent promptly sent this important intelligence to the desks of the American invading generals in Tokyo and Seoul. A conclusion should be drawn here: Party and state secrets must never be revealed to someone just because they are an acquaintance or a close relative.

There are also some people who, in order to show that they are "well-informed," are eager to spread it to others as soon as they know a little secret. It is ridiculous that he himself recklessly leaks state secrets, but at the end wants to conduct "secrecy education" to the other party: "This is a secret, don't talk about it outside!" And this person often turns around and, in the same way, "secretly" reveals it to other people. A Soviet proverb says it well: "I told him in secret, but he spread it everywhere. Old friend passed it on to little friend. Little friend passed it on to little girlfriend. Little girlfriend passed it on to the pig. Pig passed it on to the crow. The crow spread it all over the city." This is a portrayal of this kind of person. It would be good if those who talk recklessly would review our famous saying "A word spoken is past recalling."

    信口开河对谁有利
    一新
    反革命分子对信口开河、多嘴饶舌的人，是十分感到兴趣的。特务、间谍们把这些人作为“义务情报员”。他们绞尽脑汁，研究这些人的心理状态，千方百计地去寻找这样的人，希望同这些人交谈，和他们建立“友谊”。美国的情报机关就曾经指示它的特务不要放过任何一个吹牛家，“要随时随地把你们的眼睛睁开去寻找吹牛家”。一个帝国主义国家的情报机关在给它的情报人员的训令中，要求把信口乱谈的人“分成类别”，例如分成“普通的信口乱谈者和吹牛家，热烈激昂的信口乱谈者和天真无邪的信口乱谈者”。
    由此可见，信口开河、多嘴饶舌的人，常常是反革命分子窃取我们党和国家机密的好帮手。遗憾的是，这种人还到处可见。在这些人的脑子里，敌情观念，保密观念是非常淡薄的，甚至完全没有。他们不择场合，不分时间，不看对象，信口乱谈党和国家的机密。
    有这样一些人，随便在什么地方——电影院、饭馆、公园、澡塘、游泳场、街上、车站或车厢里——都信口乱讲党和国家的机密。许多人是这样想的，哪有那么巧的事，就正好有敌人在身旁偷听暗记呢？这种想法是极其危险的。这是对我国过渡时期阶级斗争的复杂性和尖锐性完全没有认识的表现。辽宁省逮捕的蒋贼特务何振亚供称：他用“闲谈”方式，从修建飞机场的工人口中，就搜集到某地飞机场的面积、设备和交工日期等等重要军事机密情报。福州市逮捕的蒋贼特务王秋航，就是经常在电影院、澡塘、汽车站等公共场所的人群里，偷听解放军和机关干部的谈话，得到许多重要的情报，受到了特务机关的“嘉奖”。那些不择场合信口乱说的人难道不应当猛醒吗？
    有这样一些人，他们经不起别人的奉承和恭维，如果有人赞扬、称颂他们几句，他们马上就会滔滔不绝地炫耀、吹嘘自己，国家机密就在这当儿泄露了出来。敌人对于这种人的弱点是作了细心研究的。如在某特务机关的一份训令中写道：“迫使一个人讲述他自己的历史，是一点也不困难的。特别是当他的制服上挂着荣誉勋章时，你可问他，这是怎样得来的，你装作一个聚精会神的听众，他会向你滔滔不绝地讲下去，最后他会吹嘘到他的军队的未来计划。要把自己锻炼成具有倾听信口乱谈的人的夸夸其谈的能手。”那些好吹嘘的人往往在这种狡猾伎俩下，帮了敌人的忙。前面提到的蒋贼特务王秋航，为了刺探当地驻军机密情报，就想尽了办法来结识我军人员。有一次，王秋航听到了当地驻军要租房子，他就主动地去帮忙。他终于结识了这个部队的一个管理员，并且摸透了这个管理员的骄傲自满、喜人奉承的“底”。这个特务分子就向他进攻：“你们是老干部啦，真不简单！”“解放军劳苦功高，对革命贡献真大啊！”这位管理员被这特务奉承得昏头昏脑，就滔滔不绝地从部队生活谈到部队任务、整编、调动情况。他一说起来就没个完。这样，特务王秋航就达到了他探听当地驻军某部军事情报的目的。
    有这样一些人，他们对于老同学、老同志、近亲密友、家里人，是一切公开，无所不谈的。这也给敌人的窃取机密活动大开了方便之门。我们不能忘记人民日报1955年8月发表的“我们不能忘记这件事”一文所揭露的前东北铁路总局厂务部部长的罪恶行为。在抗美援朝战争进行得最激烈的日子里，这位部长坐在客厅里，向一个“近亲”泄露了大量的极为重要的军事机密。这个“近亲”是部长的姐夫，过去的老同学，抗日战争前的民先队员，当时却已成了美帝国主义的间谍组织“第四十四海外观测队”的情报员。这个特务分子就把这些重要情报及时地送到了东京和汉城美国侵略将军们的案头。这里应当得出一个结论：党和国家的机密，决不能因为是熟人，是近亲就泄露给他。
    也有这样一些人，他们为了显示自己“消息灵通”，只要知道一点机密就急欲传播给人。非常可笑的是，他自己肆无忌惮地泄露国家机密，末了却要向对方进行“保密教育”：“这是机密，你可不要往外乱说！”而这个人常常转过身来，又用同样的方式，把它“秘密地”泄露给其他人。苏联的谚语说得好：“我暗中对他说，而他却四处传播。老朋友传给小朋友。小朋友传给小女伴。小女伴传给猪猡。猪猡传给乌鸦。乌鸦传遍全城。”这就是这种人物的写照。这些信口乱说的人，如果肯重温一下我国有名的格言“一言既出，驷马难追”，是有好处的。
