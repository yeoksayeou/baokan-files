    A phosphorus mine discovered in Southwest China has been preliminarily confirmed as the largest phosphorus mine in China and one of the largest existing phosphorus mines in the world. This preliminary conclusion was reached by Chinese geological workers and Soviet experts after a year of exploration. Exploration confirms that the ore layers of this phosphorus mine are very thick, the ore body extends over a wide area, and the quality of the ore is also very good. After testing, it has been confirmed that most of the ore has a phosphorus content of over 30%, and the average phosphorus content of the ore is around 25%.
    Relevant departments of the Ministry of Geology believe that the exploitation of this abundant phosphorus mine will have significant implications for the development of China's agricultural production. Exploration of this phosphorus mine began in 1955. The proven ore reserves in that year exceeded the original plan by more than two times. In 1956, geological workers will continue to explore this mining area, with plans to increase the proven reserves by about three times compared to 1955. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    西南地区发现的一个磷矿证实是世界最大磷矿之一
    西南地区发现的一个磷矿，初步证实是中国目前最大的一个磷矿，并且是世界上现有最大磷矿中的一个。这个初步结论是中国地质工作者经过一年来的勘探和苏联专家共同作出的。勘探证实：这个磷矿的矿层很厚，矿体伸延范围很广，矿石的质量也很好。经过化验，证实大部分矿石的含磷量达到30％以上，矿石的平均含磷量也在25％左右。
    地质部有关方面认为：这个储量丰富的磷矿开采以后，对发展中国的农业生产有着重大的意义。这个磷矿是1955年开始勘探的。这一年探明的矿石储量超过原计划两倍以上。1956年，地质工作者将继续在这个矿区进行勘探，计划探明的储量比1955年增加3倍左右。　（据新华社讯）
