    On Two Domestic Feature Films of the Children and Adolescent Film Week

    For a long time, we have been looking forward to seeing more films for children and adolescents, and the children have repeatedly stated: they are not satisfied with only seeing films made for them once a year on Children's Day. The Children and Adolescent Film Week, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and held simultaneously in 28 major cities across the country, allows everyone to see a considerable number of feature films, documentaries, and animated films in a concentrated manner. This is a valuable gift for the children at the start of the new semester.
    During the Children and Adolescent Film Week, we are pleased to see the domestic feature films "The Garden of Youth" and "Luo Xiaolin's Determination." These two films depict the growth of the new generation from different perspectives. The filmmakers, with great interest and enthusiasm for the new generation, introduce us to how Li Xiaohui, a third-year junior high school student, actively participated in the collective labor of opening up the campus, changing from a passive attitude; they introduce how Luo Xiaolin, a sixth-grade elementary school student, corrected his shortcomings of loving to play and wasting time. The films show how collectivist ideas are gradually formed in children, just as the children sing in "The Garden of Youth":
    　Wild geese form teams, bees gather into swarms,
    　The lagging wild geese cannot go to warm places,
    　The bees that leave the swarm cannot make honey in the hive.
    When our young viewers see Li Xiaohui holding the iron box, which no one is allowed to touch and which contains many excellent plant varieties, and handing it over to everyone, when they see Li Xiaohui accepting everyone's common opinions and revising the campus design, when they see Luo Xiaolin happily drawing double circles on the calendar recording his exercise achievements, what will they think? They will feel the warmth of friendship together with the children in the film, recognize the greatness of the collective's strength, and recognize the value of labor.
    The playwrights strive to show their lives and thoughts and feelings from some aspects of the lives of children and adolescents, and to show every step forward in the growth of children. This effort should be affirmed. The positive educational effects of these two films fully prove this point.
    However, we would rather ask for more from our own films. We demand that our films can more fully represent the brilliant, bright, and diverse real lives of the new generation, so that they become artistic works that children love, are educated by, increase knowledge, and are very interesting, and that they will not forget them for many years to come.
    In this way, we will feel that the producers of "The Garden of Youth" and "Luo Xiaolin's Determination" seem to be a little timid, not daring to let go of the rich and colorful lives of children and adolescents, not daring to arrange a wider world for children, allowing them to be filled with all kinds of interesting fantasies and curiosity and desire for knowledge of all kinds of new things, just like in life; not daring to let go and let them live independently. Both films give us a feeling of simplification: What is the great contradiction between Li Xiaohui's personal interest in plant experiments and the labor of the whole class to open up the campus? Perhaps it can be said that there is no great contradiction. The rich and complex content of labor education can never be replaced by a few scenes such as opening up the campus. Luo Xiaolin's progress is also relatively simple, almost without forming a complete story, appearing out of thin air and ending abruptly; when the audience just saw interest, the film ended.
    Unremarkable contradictions and simple stories will make people feel that the lives of children and adolescents depicted in the film are not real enough. However, the main shortcomings are that the characterization of the children—especially the personalities of several main characters—and the description of their inner worlds are not deep enough and not sufficient enough.
    Taking "Luo Xiaolin's Determination" as an example, this is adapted from Zhang Tianyi's novel "The Story of Luo Wenyin." In the novel, the author has concise but also excellent descriptions of the child's spiritual world. From those detailed descriptions, we can explore the depths of Luo Wenyin's heart and come into contact with all aspects of his personality: he has an ideal, but lacks specific goals; he is also clear about his problems, but sometimes he can't control himself; afterwards, he regrets it. … In this way, we also feel that this character is real. In the film, we also know that Luo Xiaolin is interested in cranes, but apart from the crane model on his bedside table and the fact that he once drew a crane on the road and was late home, we still don't know more from the child's own mouth and actions. What does he think about cranes and construction workers? What is the inevitable connection between these thoughts and his persistence in exercising and overcoming his shortcomings? We don't know at all. In the section where Luo Wenyin greedily reads picture books and misses going to a classmate's house to review his lessons, there are also touching descriptions in the novel, but in the film, it is also much simpler.
    Similarly, Li Xiaohui in "The Garden of Youth" appears before us as a young scientist. She has planted more than a dozen kinds of plants on the balcony and is wholeheartedly doing grafting experiments with tomatoes and eggplants. However, apart from occasionally hearing her talking to Aunt Wang about becoming Michurin in the future and the students calling her "our class's Michurin," we are not very clear about how she decided to dedicate herself to this cause. What does she think about the career of a botanist? What kind of ideals does this girl, who is about to enter high school, have for the motherland and for herself? We don't know either.
    Obviously, Luo Xiaolin and Li Xiaohui are not confused and ignorant children. They all have their own fantasies and plans. However, the film does not fully show and affirm these positive factors that exist in them, the strength that encourages them to move forward. Li Xiaohui's spirit of independent research is valuable, but people do not truly respect her independent character. She is isolated in the film; Luo Xiaolin's liveliness and interest in new things are also not given due attention. The burden of homework makes him afraid to look at the goldfish more. If the film can show these valuable positive factors in many ways, it will make their characters fuller, their personalities more prominent, and their inner world can also be fully displayed. Therefore, their lives and the contradictions in their lives will not be simplified. You need to know that they do not live in a greenhouse as isolated flowers. Their lives are part of the boiling life of our entire society. They have their own independent personalities and can live bravely and boldly. The responsibility of educators is to actively guide them, rather than interfere and restrict them too much. Even if children have some small mistakes and shortcomings, it is not surprising, and it is easy to correct them, so there is no need to be alarmed. As long as the positive factors are greatly promoted, these small shortcomings and mistakes will be corrected.
    In addition, it can also be mentioned that the image of adults is not prominent enough in these two films. Mothers and teachers seem to appear as representatives of the general concepts of mothers and teachers, lacking distinct personalities. In films for children and adolescents, the image of adults should occupy an important position. If the description of adults is simple and boring, this not only affects the complete artistry of the work, but also reduces its educational effect. Because it is precisely through them that the complexity and diversity of real life should be displayed in front of children, and it is they who guide children to the correct path in life. We can recall Qiubuke in "Cultivating Courage," the old instructor in "Comrades' Honor," and Uncle Yefim in "Lights on the River." When we think of them, we will ask the playwright to portray the images of Luo Xiaolin's mother and Teacher Shi more deeply and fully.
    We welcome "The Garden of Youth" and "Luo Xiaolin's Determination" and other new films for children and adolescents, and we are eager for filmmakers to continue to produce new films for children and adolescents. Director Yan Gong of "Luo Xiaolin's Determination" has directed two films for children and adolescents for us in a row. We hope that more directors will be enthusiastic about making films for children and adolescents. We also sincerely ask filmmakers for children and adolescents to go deeper to familiarize themselves with, observe, and study all aspects of the rich lives of children and adolescents, in cities and rural areas, in inland areas and border areas, young children and Young Pioneers, to seriously study the party's education policies, explore the secrets of the hearts of our future socialist builders, and produce more films that can more realistically and fully show the lives and qualities of the new generation.

    更丰满地表现少年儿童的生活
    谈少年儿童电影周的两部国产故事片
    袁鹰
    “青春的园地”　编剧：任德耀　导演：王为一　上海电影制片厂出品
    “罗小林的决心”编剧：王家乙　导演：严　恭　长春电影制片厂出品
    好久以来，我们都在盼望着能看到比较多的少年儿童影片，孩子们也一再提出：不满足于每年只在儿童节才能看到一次为他们摄制的影片。中华人民共和国文化部和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会联合主办的、在全国28个大城市同时举行的少年儿童电影周，使大家能够集中地看到相当数量的故事片、纪录片和动画片。这是在新的学期开始的时候给孩子们的一份宝贵的礼物。
    在少年儿童电影周里，我们高兴地看到国产故事片“青春的园地”和“罗小林的决心”。这两部影片，从不同的角度描写了新的一代的成长。电影制作者们怀着很大的兴趣和对新的一代的热情，向我们介绍了一个初中三年级学生李小蕙怎样从消极到积极地参加了开辟校园的集体劳动；介绍了一个小学六年级学生罗小林怎样改正了爱玩、耽误时间的缺点。影片表现了集体主义思想怎样在孩子们身上逐渐形成，正像“青春的园地”里孩子们所唱的：
      雁儿结成队呀，蜂儿集成群哪，
      落队的雁儿去不了温暖的地方啊，
      离群的蜂儿酿不了成窝的蜜糖啊。
    当我们的少年儿童观众们看到李小蕙捧着那个不让谁碰一下的、珍藏着许多优良的植物品种的铁匣子交给大家的时候，当他们看到李小蕙接受了大家的共同意见、改画了校园的设计图的时候，当他们看到罗小林愉快地在纪录自己锻炼成绩的月历上画上双圈的时候，他们会想到什么呢？他们会同影片的孩子们一起，感到友谊的温暖，认识到集体的力量的伟大，认识到劳动的可贵。
    剧作家们力图从少年儿童生活的一些侧面来表现他们的生活和思想感情，来表现孩子们在成长中的每一个前进的脚步，这种努力是应该肯定的。这两部影片的积极的教育效果也完全证明了这一点。
    但是，对于我们自己的影片，我们宁可要求得更多一些。我们要求我们的电影能更丰满地表现新的一代的绚烂的、明朗的、多种多样的现实生活，使它们成为孩子们所喜爱的、受着教育、增进知识而又非常有趣的艺术作品，并且在长久的年岁以后，都不会忘记它们。
    这样，我们就会感觉到：“青春的园地”和“罗小林的决心”的制作者，似乎都还有点胆怯，不敢放手地表现少年儿童的丰富多采的生活，不敢给孩子们安排更加广阔的天地，让他们像在生活中一样地充满各种有趣的幻想和对各种新鲜事物的好奇心和求知欲；不敢放开手让他们独立地去生活。这两部影片都给我们一种简单化的感觉：李小蕙研究植物试验的个人兴趣和全班开辟校园的劳动之间，究竟有怎样了不起的矛盾呢？也许可以说，并没有什么太大的矛盾。劳动教育那样丰富复杂的内容，也决不是开辟校园那样的几个场面所能代替。罗小林的进步，也比较简单，几乎没有形成一个完整的故事，凌空而来，戛然而止；当观众刚看到有兴趣的时候，影片却结束了。
    矛盾不突出，故事简单，都会使人对影片所表现的少年儿童生活有不够真实的感觉。但是，更主要的缺点，是影片对孩子们——特别作为主要人物的几个人的性格的刻划、内心世界的描写，还有不够深刻、不够充分的地方。
    以“罗小林的决心”来说，这是根据张天翼的小说“罗文应的故事”改编的，在小说里，作者对孩子的精神世界有简洁的但也是出色的描写。从那些细致的描写里，我们能够探索到罗文应的内心深处，接触到他的性格的各个方面：他有个理想，但是缺乏具体的努力目标；他也清楚自己的毛病，但是有时候又控制不住；事后，他又悔恨自己。……这样我们也就感觉到这个人物是真实的。在影片里，我们也知道罗小林对起重机发生兴趣，可是除了床头的起重机模型以及他有一次在路上画起重机而迟回家以外，我们毕竟没有从孩子本人的嘴里和行动上知道更多的东西。关于起重机，关于建筑工人，他想起什么？这些想法同他坚持锻炼、克服自己的缺点，又有些什么必然的联系呢？我们一点也不知道。在罗文应贪看画报而误了到同学家温习功课那一段，小说里也有动人的描写，而在影片里也简单得多了。
    同样，“青春的园地”里的李小蕙，是以一个少年科学家出现在我们面前的，她在洋台上种了十几种植物，专心一意地做番茄和茄子的嫁接试验，但是，我们除了偶然听她同王妈讲起过将来要做米丘林以及同学们管她叫“我们班上的米丘林”以外，我们也不太清楚她究竟是怎样决定献身于这个事业的。关于植物学家这个事业，她所想的是什么？这个很快要进入高中的少女，对祖国、对自己究竟有些什么样的理想？我们也不清楚。
    显然，罗小林和李小蕙都不是糊涂无知的孩子，他们都是有自己的幻想，有自己的打算的。但是影片没有更充分地显示出并且肯定存在于他们身上的这些积极因素，这些鼓舞他们前进的力量。李小蕙的独立钻研精神是可贵的，但是人们并没有真正尊重她的独立性格，她在影片里，是孤立的；罗小林的活泼和对新鲜事物的兴趣，也没有受到应有的重视，功课的负担使得他连金鱼都不敢多看一眼。如果影片能够多方面地表现这些可贵的积极因素，就会使得他们的性格更加丰满，个性更加突出，内心世界也可以得到充分的展现。因而他们的生活和生活里的矛盾也就不会简单化了。要知道，他们并不是孤立地生活在暖室里的花朵。他们的生活，是我们整个社会的沸腾的生活的一部分，他们有自己的独立的性格，能够勇敢地、大胆地去生活。教育者的责任，正是应该加以积极地引导，而不是过多地去干涉和限制。孩子们即使有些小错误，小缺点，也不足为奇，容易改正的，无须乎大惊小怪。只要正面的积极因素得到大大地发扬，这些小缺点和小错误就会得到改正。
    此外，还可以提一下，成年人的形象，在这两部影片里还不够突出。母亲和教师，好像是作为一般的母亲和教师的概念的代表者出现，缺乏鲜明的个性。在少年儿童影片里，成年人的形象应该占着重要的位置，如果对成年人的描写是简单的，枯燥无味的，这不仅影响了作品的完整艺术性，也降低了它的教育作用。因为正是应该通过他们，在孩子们面前展示出现实生活的复杂性和多样性，是他们引导孩子们走向正确的生活道路。我们可以回忆一下“培养勇敢精神”里的秋布克、“同志的荣誉”里的老教官和“河上灯火”里的耶菲姆舅舅，想起他们，我们就会要求剧作者对罗小林的母亲和石老师的形象，刻划得更深刻、更丰满一些。
    我们欢迎“青春的园地”和“罗小林的决心”以及其他新的少年儿童影片，渴望电影工作者不断制作新的少年儿童影片；“罗小林的决心”的导演严恭同志已经连续为我们导演了两部少年儿童影片，我们希望有更多的导演热心从事少年儿童影片的摄制工作。我们也更诚挚地要求少年儿童电影工作者们更深入地去熟悉、观察、研究少年儿童丰富的生活的各个方面，城市的和农村的，内地的和边疆的，幼年儿童和少先队员，去认真研究党的教育政策，探索我们未来的社会主义建设者心头的秘密，制作出更多的、更能真实地、丰满地表现出新的一代的生活和品质的影片。
