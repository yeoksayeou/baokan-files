    February 21st is a day for anti-colonialist struggle.
    Egypt News Agency Editor-in-Chief Sa Wei
    If the people of the world believe that on this day there is some impetus for striving to get rid of colonialism and eliminate colonialism, then the Egyptian people consider this day to be their own, because this day originated in Egypt, and with the sacrifices made by Egyptian youth to get rid of colonialism, this day spread among all nations of the world.
    The story of this day is this: In February 1946, the Second World War had ended. The reasons for British troops being stationed on Egyptian territory and in major Egyptian cities no longer existed. The Egyptian people unanimously rose up to demand freedom and independence.
    The Egyptian people expressed their views. They said that since the purpose of the Allied Powers in participating in the war was to stop fascist aggression and to liberate the people of all countries from the Nazi danger, the Allied Powers should honor their promises and return the sovereignty of all countries to them. Otherwise, the Allied Powers are acting in a play, deceiving the people of all countries with dramatic actions.
    Egyptian workers went on strike, students boycotted classes, and the masses gathered to shout slogans for freedom and independence.
    It was unanimously decided to hold a peaceful demonstration on February 21, 1946, to demand the rights they deserve in a free and precious life.
    But as they advanced in a peaceful demonstration, British tanks drove out of the occupation army's barracks, and British machine guns strafed the crowd, trying to suppress their voices. British tanks responded to their demands for legitimate rights with shells.
    Martyrs fell one after another, and blood flowed through the streets, but the ranks of the people's revolution marched forward bravely, shouting slogans of freedom and independence.
    The pressure from the occupation army intensified, and reactionaries helped them as accomplices. Although the demonstration stopped, it did not "die." The colonialists and their accomplices thought the problem was solved and the people were desperate.
    The colonialists and their accomplices forgot that people sometimes remain silent, but they do not yield.
    The Egyptian people's struggle was sometimes open and sometimes hidden, until July 23, 1952, when the Egyptian Revolution broke out under the leadership of the armed forces. The throne of traitors collapsed, and the reactionaries also collapsed with it. The colonialists had no choice but to concede, so they were forced to decide to withdraw from Egypt.
    By June 20, 1956, the last British soldier will withdraw from Egyptian territory.
    On that day, Egypt will recall its past.
    On that day, Egypt will be proud of its history.
    On that day, Egypt will look forward to its future.

    2月21日是埃及的日子
    埃及通讯社总编辑　萨韦
    2月21日是反殖民主义斗争的日子。
    如果世界各国人民认为在这个日子里有着为摆脱殖民主义和消灭殖民主义而努力的某种动力，那末，埃及人民认为这个日子是他们自己的日子，因为这个日子是从埃及发生的，随着埃及青年为摆脱殖民主义而作的牺牲，这个日子传播于世界各民族之间。
    这个日子的故事是这样的：1946年2月，第二次世界大战已经结束了，英国军队驻扎在埃及领土上和埃及各大城市里的种种理由已不复存在了，埃及人民就一致奋起，要求自由和独立。
    埃及人民发表了自己的意见。他们说，同盟国参战的目的既然是制止法西斯的侵略，是从纳粹的危险中解放各国人民，同盟国就应该实践自己的诺言，把各国人民的主权归还他们，否则，同盟国就是在演剧，在用戏剧性的行动欺骗各国人民。
    埃及的工人罢工了，学生罢课了，人民群众集聚起来，高呼争取自由和争取独立的口号。
    大家一致议决，在1946年2月21日举行和平的示威游行，要求他们在自由的、珍贵的生活中应有的权利。
    但是当他们在和平的示威游行中前进的时候，英国的坦克车从占领军的营房里开出来了，英国的机枪向群众扫射，想要压制他们的呼声。英国的坦克用炮弹来答复他们对合法权利的要求。
    烈士们相继倒下了，碧血流遍街头，但人民革命的队伍勇往直前，高呼自由独立的口号。
    占领军的压力加强了，反动分子替他们帮凶，示威游行虽然停止了，但是并没有“死亡”。殖民主义者和他们的帮凶们以为问题已经解决了，人民已经绝望了。
    殖民主义者和他们的帮凶们忘记了，人民有时沉默，但是他们并不屈服。
    埃及人民的斗争有时是公开的斗争，有时是隐蔽的斗争，直到1952年7月23日，埃及革命在武装力量的领导下爆发了，卖国者的宝座垮台了，反动分子们也随着垮台了，殖民主义者除了让步别无办法，于是他们被迫决定从埃及撤退。
    等到1956年6月20日，最后一个英国兵就要从埃及的国土撤走。
    在那一天，埃及将要回忆它的过去。
    在那一天，埃及将因它的既往自豪。
    在那一天，埃及将要展望它的前程。
