    Resolution on Strengthening the Work of Industrial Unions
    I.
    Organizing trade unions by industry on the basis of democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational principle of trade unions in our country. At present, our country is carrying out the great socialist construction and socialist transformation. At this time, further implementing the industrial principle of organizing trade unions can unite workers and staff in the same sector of the national economy nationwide, strengthen workers' sense of responsibility for completing the planned tasks of their respective sectors and the entire national economic plan; deeply summarize and promote the production experience of advanced producers and advanced enterprises, and continuously push socialist emulation to new heights; enable various trade union organizations and corresponding administrative management organs to closely cooperate with each other in their work, and facilitate the attraction of the broad masses of workers and staff to participate in improving the work of administrative management organs at all levels; and enable various trade union organizations to more accurately organize work related to wages, labor protection, and cultural and material welfare services effectively, based on the characteristics of various sectors of the national economy and the specific needs of the masses of workers and staff.
    During the period of national economic recovery, the work of trade unions in various regions was extremely uneven, the grassroots foundation of trade unions was weak, and at that time, the main task of trade unions was to mobilize the masses of workers and staff to rapidly restore the damaged national economy and carry out democratic reforms. Therefore, the tasks undertaken by trade unions at that time should be mainly carried out by local trade unions under the leadership of local Party committees. At that time, establishing industrial unions too much or too early was not appropriate.
    Now, our country's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has been underway for 3 years, and completing and striving to over fulfill the first Five-Year Plan is the common goal of all workers and staff across the country; the work of government departments at all levels has been systematically established; and private industrial and commercial enterprises are rapidly undergoing socialist transformation by industry. Therefore, socialist emulation, wage work, labor protection, and the material and cultural lives of workers and staff must all be organized according to the characteristics of each industry. Under these circumstances, the organizational and working methods of the past democratic reform period are no longer compatible with the development of the current situation. To adapt to the current situation, it is necessary to strengthen industrial unions. However, at present, industrial unions are not sound. Among the existing 18 industrial unions, only the railway, Second Machine Building, seafarers, and postal and telecommunications unions are working according to the industrial system, while other industrial unions only play a guiding role to varying degrees in major tasks such as mass production. In addition, some industrial sectors have not established corresponding industrial unions.
    Strengthening the work of industrial unions is an urgent need at present, and it is also entirely possible. Local trade unions are increasingly deeply aware of the necessity of strengthening industrial unions. Under the leadership of local Party committees, they are establishing and improving regional industrial unions, and are beginning to pay attention to promoting regional industrial unions to carry out their work. At present, the grassroots organizations of trade unions have been strengthened to some extent, and some experience has been accumulated in carrying out trade union work according to the industrial system, which has prepared the necessary conditions for strengthening the work of industrial unions.
    In the struggle to build socialism in our country, trade unions should become the mass combat organizations of the working class. In order to better exert the role of trade unions, we must strive to strengthen the work of industrial unions, and strive to establish and improve all existing and should-be-established industrial unions within one or two years; and improve the working methods of local trade unions according to this requirement.
    II.
    To strengthen the work of industrial unions, the first thing to do is to improve the existing industrial unions so that they implement systematic leadership by industry.
    Due to the different situations in each industry, the different degrees of establishment and improvement of intermediate links in each industrial union, and the different experiences accumulated by the National Committees of each industrial union in carrying out work according to the industrial system, the degree to which each industrial union implements systematic leadership will temporarily have to be different, and the time when most industrial unions implement systematic leadership must also be in batches and phases. In addition to the railway, Second Machine Building, seafarers, and postal and telecommunications industrial unions, which have already implemented systematic leadership, the following requirements are put forward for other industrial unions:
    The electricity, petroleum, and salt industrial unions should basically achieve systematic leadership in the first half of 1956.
    The heavy industry, First Machine Building, coal mining, textile, forestry, and highway transportation industrial unions should implement systematic leadership over most of their affiliated trade union organizations within 1956.
    The construction, agriculture and water conservancy, light industry, commerce, and education industrial unions should implement systematic leadership over the affiliated trade union organizations in some regions in 1956, and actively prepare conditions to strive for basically achieving systematic leadership over the affiliated trade union organizations in 1957.
    In order to unite workers and staff in certain sectors of the national economy nationwide according to industry, it is necessary to gradually restore some of the industrial unions that were abolished in the past, and establish some new industrial unions in the next one or two years:
    Restore the civil aviation, geology, finance and banking, and medical and health industrial unions.
    Establish the foreign trade, cultural workers, grain and agricultural product procurement, supply and marketing cooperatives, and government employees industrial unions.
    When the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region local trade unions deem it necessary, they can establish local industrial unions in their respective regions; and in cities with a large number of municipal public utilities workers and staff, establish municipal public utilities unions.
    In order to strengthen leadership and make trade unions closer to the masses of workers and staff, it is necessary to reduce the scope of industrial unions that are too large in organization:
    The heavy industry union and the light industry union should be appropriately divided according to the adjustment of the administrative management system.
    III.
    According to the provisions of the trade union constitution adopted by the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, the specific responsibilities of the National Committees of industrial unions are determined as follows:
    (1) To organize socialist emulation jointly with the corresponding ministries (general administrations) of the State Council.
    (2) To organize the signing of collective contracts by affiliated enterprises and institutions jointly with the corresponding ministries (general administrations) of the State Council.
    (3) To attract the masses of workers and staff to participate in improving the leadership of economic management organs at all levels over production, and to assist and supervise administrative management organs at all levels to improve the working conditions and material and cultural living conditions of workers and staff.
    (4) To participate in the formulation of the wage system and the work of adjusting wages, and to supervise the correct expenditure of wage funds.
    (5) To approve the work plans and work summaries of affiliated trade union organizations; to lead affiliated trade union organizations to carry out work related to labor protection, labor insurance, production propaganda, cultural and technical education, living quarters, and women workers, family members, and children.
    (6) To manage trade union financial work, and to review and approve the budgets and final accounts of trade union funds and labor insurance funds of affiliated trade union organizations.
    (7) To manage trade union cadres in the industrial system, and to train trade union cadres.
    (8) To manage sanatoriums and recuperation centers run by the industrial system.
    (9) To guide the activities of voluntary sports associations, and to help their development.
    (10) To develop contacts with foreign trade unions.
    The National Committees of each industrial union must take the following measures to improve their work, strengthen leadership, and truly assume the above-mentioned responsibilities.
    (1) Formulate work plans on an annual and quarterly basis. The plan should specifically stipulate the major measures to be taken, and organize daily work around the realization of these major measures. Review and approve the annual and quarterly work plans and major facilities of lower-level trade union organizations, and go deep down to check their implementation based on the work plans of lower-level trade union organizations. Through inspection, summarize work experience and widely introduce these experiences using various methods; discover shortcomings in the work and help them improve their work in a timely manner.
    (2) Establish necessary departmental work according to the characteristics of the industry. Each department should assist the National Committee in researching and guiding various business work of lower-level organizations, maintain close contact with the relevant divisions, bureaus, or sections of the corresponding departments of the State Council, and help the National Committee understand the situation in this regard. In order to improve departmental work, the National Committees of each industrial union can reduce or abolish the office structure and establish a guidance system within the departments.
    (3) Promoting advanced experience is a regular and effective method of continuously pushing socialist emulation to new heights, helping workers to meet quotas, and ensuring the completion and over fulfillment of national plans. Each industrial union must take practical and specific measures in conjunction with the administrative departments to systematically summarize and promote the experience of advanced producers, and systematically introduce and promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, especially to organize advanced enterprises to help backward enterprises, and gradually raise backward enterprises to the level of advanced enterprises.
    (4) Run trade union professional cadre training courses, use various methods to exchange trade union work experience among various trade union organizations, and constantly and systematically improve the political and ideological level and business work ability of trade union cadres and activists.
    (5) In accordance with the provisions of the trade union constitution, regularly hold congresses of representatives and conferences of representatives; attract workers and staff to put forward criticisms and suggestions to the National Committee through methods such as directly reporting work to the workers' congress of enterprises and the conferences of representatives of intermediate links; hold various mass activities, strengthen ties with the masses of workers and staff, carry out communist education in many ways, and constantly improve the consciousness and organization of the masses of workers and staff.
    IV.
    While strengthening the work of industrial unions, local trade unions must improve their working methods and give full play to their role.
    The local trade union is the joint leading organ of various industrial unions in a region. The local trade union should strengthen the industrial union from the organizational level, and practically rely on the various industrial unions in the region to carry out various tasks, and regularly inspect and guide the work of each industrial union. In order to clarify the division of labor between industrial unions and local trade unions, the responsibilities of local trade unions are determined as follows:
    (1) Organize the common activities of various industrial unions:
    Carry out regional socialist emulation of the same type of work, and promote advanced production experience between enterprises that produce similar products and between workers of the same type of work;
    Specifically implement the instructions of the local Party committee, and organize various industrial unions and all grassroots trade union organizations to complete regional political and economic tasks; organize workers' study of political theory and current affairs policies;
    Summarize and promote advanced experience in trade union work, and hold joint training courses or lectures for various industrial unions;
    Organize various industrial unions to carry out cultural and educational work, and hold cultural facilities that serve the workers and staff of various industries; entrust the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to run and manage trade union sanatoriums and recuperation centers and other undertakings.
    Under the leadership of the local Party committee, organize local factories, enterprises, government agencies, and schools to provide guidance to rural areas.
    (2) Check the implementation of the resolutions and instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions by local trade union organizations; supervise the intermediate links of each industrial union to earnestly implement the resolutions and instructions of the National Committee, and help each industrial union improve its work.
    (3) Lead all the work of various trade union organizations that do not yet have a National Committee of the industrial union; lead the work of various trade union organizations that have a National Committee of the industrial union but have not yet implemented systematic leadership, and take all possible measures to help these trade union organizations to possess the necessary conditions for implementing systematic leadership as soon as possible.
    (4) Attract local trade union organizations to assist and supervise the local government in improving the work of medical and health institutions, municipal public utilities, cultural and educational institutions, and supply agencies.
    V.
    The provincial, municipal, autonomous region, county, road district, air district, mining area, forest area, and salt area committees of each industrial union are the intermediate links of the industrial union. The intermediate links of each industrial union should generally be established in places where there are many grassroots organizations of each industrial union and where the administration has a level of management agency. When establishing intermediate links, each industrial union should pay close attention to reducing organizational levels and facilitating contact with the masses.
    The intermediate links of the industrial union lead all trade union work of affiliated trade union organizations.
    The local trade union has the responsibility to establish and improve the intermediate links of the industrial union. The local trade union should help each industrial union select and equip appropriate cadres to establish the necessary intermediate links, so that they form a working force and gradually cultivate their ability to work independently. In addition, the local trade union must adjust the organizational scope of the intermediate links of each industrial union according to the organizational scope of the National Committee of each industrial union.
    Under the circumstances of implementing systematic leadership by industry, the intermediate links of the industrial union should report the work situation to the National Committee (and also copy to the local trade union); and report the situation of realizing regional political and economic tasks and other regional work to the local trade union (and also copy to the National Committee of the industrial union). The National Committee of the industrial union should copy its resolutions, decisions, and instructions to the local trade union where the intermediate link of the industrial union is located; the local trade union should take all possible measures to help the intermediate link of the industrial union realize these resolutions, decisions, and instructions. If the local trade union considers the resolutions, decisions, and instructions of the National Committee of the industrial union to be not entirely appropriate, it should report to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; before the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has instructions and the National Committee of the industrial union has not revised them, the intermediate link of the industrial union should still implement the above-mentioned resolutions, decisions, and instructions. The National Committee of the industrial union should strengthen contact with local trade unions in carrying out work; the intermediate links of the industrial union must actively and proactively obtain the supervision and assistance of local trade unions in carrying out work. Local trade unions do not manage the financial work of trade union organizations that have implemented systematic leadership, but must supervise the financial activities of these trade union organizations. The funds required by local trade unions in holding various activities shall be budgeted uniformly and allocated by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
    Establishing and improving industrial unions is one of the keys to strengthening and improving trade union work at present. All trade union organizations should unify their understanding and actively do this work well.

    关于加强产业工会工作的决议
    一
    在民主集中制的基础上按产业组织工会，是我国工会的根本组织原则。目前，我国正在进行伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造，在这个时候，进一步贯彻组织工会的产业原则，就能够使国民经济中同一部门的职工在全国范围内联合起来，加强职工对完成各该部门计划任务以及完成整个国民经济计划的责任感；就能够深入地总结和推广先进生产者和先进企业的生产经验，不断地把社会主义竞赛推向新的高涨；就能够使工会各个组织和相应的行政管理机关紧密地相互配合进行工作，并且便于吸引广大职工群众参加改进各级行政管理机关的工作；就能够使各个工会组织更确切地根据国民经济各部门的特点及职工群众的具体需要，有效地组织工资、劳动保护及文化、物质生活服务等工作。
    在国民经济恢复时期，各地工会工作极不平衡，工会下层基础薄弱，而且当时工会的主要任务是发动职工群众迅速地恢复被破坏的国民经济，进行民主改革，所以，当时工会所担负的任务应当主要地由地方工会在地方党委的领导下来进行。那时，过多地、过早地建立产业工会是不适宜的。
    现在，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划已经进行了3年，完成并且争取提前完成第一个五年计划是全国职工的共同努力目标；政府各部门的工作已经系统地建立起来；私营工商业正在迅速地按行按业进行社会主义改造。因而，社会主义竞赛、工资工作、劳动保护以及职工物质、文化生活等工作都必须根据各个产业的特点按产业系统来组织。在这种情况下，过去的民主改革时期的组织方式和工作方式，已经同当前形势的发展不相适应。为了适应当前形势，就必须加强产业工会。可是，目前产业工会却是不健全的，现有的18个产业工会中，只有铁路、第二机械、海员、邮电4个是按产业系统进行工作的，其他的产业工会只是在群众生产等主要工作上起着不同程度的指导作用。此外，还有一些产业部门没有建立相应的产业工会。
    加强产业工会的工作是当前迫切的需要，同时也是完全可以做到的。各地方工会日益深切地感觉到加强产业工会的必要，它们在地方党委的领导下正在建立和健全地区性的产业工会，并且开始注意到推动地区性的产业工会来进行工作。目前工会基层组织已经有所加强，按产业系统进行工会工作方面也已经积累了一些经验，这些都为加强产业工会的工作准备了必需的条件。
    在我国建设社会主义的斗争中，工会应该成为工人阶级群众性的战斗组织。为了更好地发挥工会的作用，我们必须努力加强产业工会的工作，争取在一两年内把已有的和应该建立的产业工会都健全和建立起来；并且根据这一要求，来改进地方工会的工作方式。
    二
    加强产业工会的工作，首先要健全已有的产业工会，使它们按产业实行系统领导。
    由于各个产业的情况不同，各个产业工会中间环节建立和健全的程度不同，各产业工会全国委员会积累的按产业系统进行工作的经验也不同，所以，各产业工会实行系统领导的程度暂时还应该是不同的，大部分产业工会实行系统领导的时间也必须是分批、分期的。除了铁路、第二机械、海员、邮电4个产业工会已实行系统领导以外，对其他产业工会分别提出如下要求：
    电业、石油、盐业3个产业工会在1956年上半年基本上实现系统领导。
    重工业、第一机械、煤矿、纺织、林业、公路运输6个产业工会在1956年内对所属大部分工会组织实现系统领导。
    建筑、农业水利、轻工业、商业、教育5个产业工会在1956年对一部分地区的所属工会组织实行系统领导，并且积极准备条件，争取在1957年对所属工会组织基本上实现系统领导。
    为了使某些国民经济部门的职工在全国范围内按产业联合起来，必须在今后一两年内，逐步恢复过去撤销了的一些产业工会，并且建立一些新的产业工会：
    恢复民用航空、地质、财政金融、医务4个产业工会。
    建立对外贸易、文化工作者、粮食及农产品采购、供销合作社、机关工作者5个产业工会。
    省、市、自治区的地方工会认为有必要时，可以建立各该地区的地方工业工会；在市政公用事业职工较多的市，建立市的市政公用事业工会。
    为了加强领导，使工会更接近职工群众，必须把组织范围过于庞杂的产业工会划小：
    将重工业工会和轻工业工会依据行政管理系统的调整做适当的划分。
    三
    根据中国工会第七次全国代表大会所通过的工会章程的规定，具体确定产业工会全国委员会的职责是：
    （一）会同国务院相应的部（总管理局）组织社会主义竞赛。
    （二）会同国务院相应的部（总管理局）组织所属企业单位签订集体合同。
    （三）吸引职工群众参加改进各级经济管理机关对生产的领导工作，协助并且监督各级行政管理机关改善职工的劳动条件及物质、文化生活条件。
    （四）参加制定工资制度及调整工资的工作，监督工资基金的正确开支。
    （五）批准所属工会组织的工作计划及工作总结；领导所属工会组织开展劳动保护、劳动保险、生产宣传、文化技术教育、生活住宅、女工家属儿童工作。
    （六）管理工会财务工作，审查、批准所属工会组织的工会经费及劳动保险经费的预决算。
    （七）管理本产业系统的工会干部，培养、训练工会干部。
    （八）管理本产业系统举办的疗养院、休养所。
    （九）指导志愿体育协会的活动，并且帮助它的发展。
    （十）发展同外国工会的联系。
    各产业工会全国委员会必须采取如下措施，以便改进工作，健全领导，确实担负起上述职责。
    （一）按年、按季地制定工作计划。计划中要具体规定所要进行的各项重大措施，围绕实现这些重大措施来组织日常工作。审查批准下一级工会组织的年度、季度工作计划及重大设施，并且深入下去，依据下级工会组织的工作计划检查他们的执行情况。通过检查，总结工作经验，并且运用各种方式，把这些经验广泛地介绍出去；发现工作中的缺点，及时地帮助他们改进工作。
    （二）根据本产业的特点，建立必要的部门工作。各个部门要帮助全国委员会对下级组织的各项业务工作进行研究和指导，同国务院相应部门的有关司、局或科密切联系，帮助全国委员会了解这方面的情况。为了健全部门工作，各产业工会全国委员会可以缩小或者取消办公室的机构，并且在部门内建立指导员制。
    （三）推广先进经验是将社会主义竞赛不断推向高涨、帮助工人达到定额、保证完成和超额完成国家计划的经常有效的方法。各产业工会必须会同行政部门采取切实的具体措施，系统地总结和推广先进生产者的经验，系统地介绍和推广苏联及各人民民主国家的先进经验，特别是要组织先进企业对落后企业进行帮助，逐步地使落后企业提高到先进企业的水平。
    （四）举办工会专业干部训练班，采用各种方式在各工会组织间交流工会工作经验，经常地、有系统地提高工会干部和积极分子的政治思想水平和业务工作能力。
    （五）按照工会章程的规定，定期举行代表大会及代表会议；通过直接向企业的职工大会及中间环节的代表会议报告工作等方式，吸引职工群众向全国委员会提出批评和建议；举办各种群众性的活动，密切同职工群众的联系，从多方面进行共产主义教育，不断地提高职工群众的觉悟程度和组织程度。四
    在加强产业工会工作的同时，地方工会必须改进自己的工作方式，充分地发挥自己的作用。
  地方工会是一个地区内各产业工会的联合领导机关。地方工会应该从组织上来加强产业工会，并且切实依靠该地区内的各个产业工会进行各项工作，经常检查、指导各产业工会的工作。为了明确产业工会和地方工会的分工，确定地方工会的职责是：
    （一）组织各产业工会的共同性活动：
    开展地区性同工种社会主义竞赛，在生产同类产品的企业之间和同工种工人之间推广先进生产经验；
    具体贯彻地方党委的指示，组织各产业工会和所有工会基层组织完成地区性的政治、经济任务；组织职工的政治理论和时事政策的学习；
    总结和推广工会工作的先进经验，举办各产业工会联合的训练班或讲座；
    组织各产业工会开展文化教育工作，举办为各产业职工服务的文化设施；受全国总工会的委托举办和管理工会疗养院和休养所等事业。
    在当地党委领导下，组织当地工厂、企业、机关、学校对农村进行辅导。
    （二）检查当地各工会组织执行中华全国总工会的决议、指示的情况；监督各产业工会中间环节切实执行全国委员会的决议、指示，帮助各产业工会改善工作。
    （三）领导尚无产业工会全国委员会的各工会组织的全部工作；领导虽有产业工会全国委员会，但是尚未实行系统领导的各工会组织的工作，并且采取一切可能的措施，帮助这些工会组织早日具备实行系统领导所必需的条件。
    （四）吸引当地各工会组织协助和监督地方政府改善医疗事业单位、市政公用事业单位、文化教育事业单位以及供应机关的工作。
    五
    各产业工会的省、市、自治区、县、路区、航区、矿区、林区、盐区委员会是产业工会的中间环节。各产业工会的中间环节一般应该建立在各该产业工会基层组织较多，而行政又设有一级管理机构的地方。各产业工会在建立中间环节的时候，应该十分注意减少组织层次和便于接近群众。
    产业工会的中间环节领导所属工会组织的全部工会工作。
    地方工会有责任将产业工会中间环节建立和健全起来。地方工会应该帮助各产业工会为建立必要的中间环节挑选和配备适当的干部，使他们形成一支工作力量，逐步培养他们独立进行工作的能力。此外，地方工会必须依据各产业工会全国委员会的组织范围来调整各产业工会中间环节的组织范围。
    在按产业实行系统领导的情况下，产业工会中间环节应该向全国委员会报告工作情况（同时抄送地方工会）；并且向地方工会报告其实现地区性政治、经济任务和地区性其他工作的情况（同时抄送产业工会全国委员会）。产业工会全国委员会应该将自己的决议、决定、指示抄送本产业工会中间环节所在地的地方工会；地方工会应该采取一切可能的措施，帮助产业工会中间环节实现这些决议、决定、指示。地方工会对产业工会全国委员会的决议、决定、指示，认为不尽妥善时，应该报告中华全国总工会；在中华全国总工会没有指示及产业工会全国委员会没有修改以前，产业工会中间环节仍旧应该执行上述决议、决定、指示。产业工会全国委员会在进行工作中应该加强同地方工会的联系；产业工会中间环节在进行工作中，必须积极主动地取得地方工会的监督和帮助。地方工会不管理已实行系统领导的工会组织的财务工作，但是必须监督这些工会组织的财务活动。地方工会在举办各种活动中所需的经费，统一造具预算，由中华全国总工会批拨。
    建立和健全产业工会，是目前加强和改进工会工作的关键之一。所有工会组织应当统一认识，并且积极地来做好这一工作。
