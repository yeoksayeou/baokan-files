The Ministry of Culture and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Issue Instructions
Requiring Grassroots Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to Engage in Book Distribution Business

Xinhua News Agency: The Ministry of Culture and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued a joint instruction on January 30, requiring all of the existing 27,000+ grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and nearly 200,000 retail stores across the country to engage in book distribution business in order to meet the needs of the current upsurge in rural cultural construction.

The instruction stated that experience over the past few years has proven that distributing books in rural areas through supply and marketing cooperatives is the correct direction for improving rural distribution work. In 1956, with the exception of ethnic minority areas where there is currently no need or conditions for this, all grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives should add book distribution services. Cultural goods stores under the leadership of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives must sell books. Before cultural goods stores are established, book sections or counters can be set up in general stores. Rural booksellers will be uniformly arranged by the supply and marketing cooperatives, and they will also be supplied with goods. The instruction also stipulated a sales target of 3.7 billion copies (issues) of books for 1956.

    文化部和全国供销合作总社发出指示
    要求基层供销社经营图书发行业务
    文化部和中华全国供销合作总社1月30日发出联合指示，要求全国现有27，000多个基层供销合作社、近20万个零售店经营图书发行业务，以适应当前农村文化建设高潮的需要。
    指示说，几年来的经验证明，通过供销合作社在农村发行图书是改善农村发行工作的正确方向。在1956年内，除少数民族地区目前还没有这种需要和条件外，所有基层供销合作社都增加图书发行业务，在基层供销合作社领导的文化用品商店内，必须经营书籍，在没有设立文化用品商店以前，可在综合商店内设立图书部或专柜。农村的书贩统一由供销合作社安排，并且供给他们货源。这个指示还规定了1956年销书37，000亿册（份）的指标。　（新华社）
