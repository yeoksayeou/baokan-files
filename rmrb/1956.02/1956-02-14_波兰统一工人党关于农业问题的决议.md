Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Warsaw, February 13th, based on TASS: The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party held its Fifth Plenary Session in Warsaw on February 8th and 9th. The meeting adopted the "Resolution on Developing Agriculture and the Party's Tasks in Rural Areas, 1956-1960."

The resolution points out that the main achievement in realizing the past six-year plan—national industrialization—has had a decisive impact on improving the material and cultural life of the Polish peasant masses and on consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. In the past six years, Poland's agricultural production has increased by 19%, and animal husbandry production has increased by 34%. There has also been great progress in agricultural mechanization. However, the achievements in agricultural production cannot fully meet the needs of the national economy. An excessive imbalance has occurred between the rapid growth of industry and the growth of agriculture. The production of socialist industry has increased by more than 180% compared to 1949, while agricultural production has increased by only 19%.

The resolution emphasizes that during the six-year plan, the socialist component in Polish agriculture has greatly increased. Currently, the arable land owned by the socialist component accounts for about 23% of all arable land. The basic premise of the Party's policy in the next five years will be to consistently carry out the socialist transformation of the countryside, while utilizing all possibilities to increase the production of individual farmers under the condition of restricting capitalist factors.

The resolution states that our Party points out to the entire people that the fundamental transformation in agricultural production, the overcoming of the current disconnect between the speed of industrial and agricultural development, the rapid development of agricultural productivity, and the improvement of the welfare and culture of the broad masses of peasants can only be achieved by transforming individual small-scale farmers into socialist collective economies that can fully utilize the latest achievements in agricultural science and technology. The victory of socialism in our country cannot be achieved without fulfilling this task. The transformation to a collective cooperative economy should be carried out continuously and at a faster pace than in 1949-1955, based on the principle of voluntariness, the level of awareness of the peasant masses, and the extent of the expansion of the socialist material and technological foundation.

The resolution stipulates that by the end of this five-year plan, agricultural production cooperatives will own 25% to 30% of the total arable land of farmers. In 1956-1960, agricultural production must increase by 25%. By 1960, the total number of tractors used in agriculture will increase to 112,000 (each with 15 horsepower), which is twice that of 1955. The number of combine harvesters will increase sevenfold. The number of cattle should increase by 2.1 million during the five-year plan.

    波兰统一工人党关于农业问题的决议
    新华社据塔斯社华沙13日讯　波兰统一工人党中央委员会，2月8日和9日在华沙举行了第五次全体会议。会议通过了“关于1956—1960年发展农业和党在农村中的任务”的决议。
    决议指出，在实现过去的六年计划中所取得的主要成就——国家工业化，已经对改善波兰农民群众的物质生活和文化水平以及对巩固工农联盟产生了有决定意义的影响。在过去六年中，波兰的农业生产增长了19％，畜牧业生产增长了34％。农业机械化方面也有了很大的进展。但是，农业生产方面所取得的成就不能充分满足国民经济的需要。工业的迅速增长和农业的增长之间发生了过度的不平衡。社会主义工业的生产比1949年增长了180％以上，而农业生产仅仅增长了19％。
    决议强调指出，在六年计划期间，波兰农业中的社会主义成分大大增长了。现在，社会主义成分所拥有的耕地约占全部耕地的23％。党在今后五年中的政策的基本前提，将是一贯地对农村实行社会主义改造，同时在限制资本主义因素的条件下利用一切可能来提高个体农户的生产。
    决议说，我们党向全体人民指明，农业生产中的根本转变、工农业发展速度中目前存在的脱节现象的克服、农业生产力的迅速发展、广大农民群众福利和文化的提高，只有在把个体小生产的农户转变成能够充分利用最新的农业科学技术成就的社会主义集体经济的基础上才能达到。这一任务不实现就谈不上社会主义在我国的胜利。向集体合作制经济的转变应该不断地、比1949—1955年的速度更快地进行，应该根据自愿原则，根据农民群众的觉悟程度以及社会主义物质技术基础扩大的程度进行。
    决议规定，到这一个五年计划结束的时候，农业生产合作社将拥有农民的耕地总面积的25％到30％。在1956—1960年，农业生产必须增长25％。到1960年，农业用的拖拉机总数将增加到112，000台（每台以15匹马力计算），即增为1955年的两倍。收获联合机增加到七倍。牛的头数在五年计划期间应该增加210万头。
