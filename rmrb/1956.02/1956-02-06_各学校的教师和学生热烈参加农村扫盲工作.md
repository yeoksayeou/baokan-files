    Teachers in primary schools in various regions, after studying Chairman Mao’s report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," realized the significance of eliminating illiteracy for socialist construction and actively requested to participate in literacy work. Primary school teachers in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, in five villages including Xiasile, proposed an initiative to primary school teachers across the county to help with literacy work, which was responded to by 154 primary school teachers from Taigu, Qi County, Lishan and other counties. In Suiping County, Xinyang Special District, Henan Province, 131 teachers from primary schools in 19 villages including Tushan and Yangdian proposed an initiative to primary school teachers across the special district to "Actively Participate in Literacy Work."

    Many primary school teachers have already taken active steps to tutor teachers in people's schools, help compile teaching materials, and participate in social publicity work for literacy campaigns. Teachers at Tatou Primary School in the Second District of Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, established a "Winter School Tutoring Station." Hexiang Township in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, organized "People's Teacher Sunday Schools" to help teachers in people's schools study. More than 40 primary schools in Qingshan District, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, helped literacy classes compile "Work-Recording Literacy Textbooks."

    Many university, middle school, and primary school students in many places also enthusiastically participated in literacy work. Students from the Agricultural Economics Department and Economics Department of the Renmin University of China have already begun helping farmers from the Chenguang and Xinxing agricultural cooperatives in Bagou Township, Beijing suburbs, to study culture. The Farmers' Night School run by Shandong Agricultural College already has more than 190 students. Wu Yiru, a student from the Chinese Department of Northeastern University, and others also suggested organizing national youth students to participate in rural literacy work during winter vacation. More than 1,800 students from 3 middle schools in Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, used holidays to go to 95 villages including Hubi to assist cooperatives in compiling literacy textbooks. Students above the third and fourth grades of primary schools and Young Pioneers in many places also acted as "little teachers" to help their fathers and mothers become literate.

    各学校的教师和学生热烈参加农村扫盲工作
    各地小学教师学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，认识到扫除文盲对社会主义建设的重要意义，积极要求参加扫除文盲工作。山西省昔阳县下思乐等5个村的小学教师向全县小学教师提出帮助扫盲工作的倡议，得到太谷、祁县、离山等县154名小学教师的响应。河南省信阳专区遂平县土山、杨店等19个村的小学校131名教师向全专区小学教师提出了“积极参加扫盲工作”的倡议。
    许多地方的小学教师已经积极行动起来，辅导民校教师教学，帮助编写教材和参加扫盲的社会宣传工作。福建省连江县二区塔头小学教师成立了“冬学辅导站”。江苏省江阴县河湘乡组织了“民师星期学校”，帮助民校教师学习。山东省荣成县青山区40多所小学帮助识字班编“记工识字课本”。
    许多地方的大、中、小学学生，也热烈参加了扫盲工作。中国人民大学农业经济系和经济系同学已经开始帮助北京郊区巴沟乡晨光、新星两农业合作社的农民学习文化。山东农学院学生主办的农民夜校已经有190多名学员。东北大学中文系学生吴益如等还建议组织全国青年学生利用寒假参加农村扫盲工作。山西省洪赵县3个中学的1，800多名学生，利用假日到户璧等95个乡村，协助合作社编写识字课本。许多地方的小学校三、四年级以上的学生和少年先锋队员也当“小先生”，帮助自己的爸爸、妈妈识字。
