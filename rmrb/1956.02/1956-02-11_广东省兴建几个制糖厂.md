    Guangdong Province has already begun the capital construction of local sugar refining industry this year. The Huiyang Sugar Refinery with a daily crushing capacity of 1,000 tons and the Huizhou Sugar Refinery, Chengyue Sugar Refinery, and Changpo Sugar Refinery, each with a daily crushing capacity of 350 tons, have all started construction. The Sino-foreign joint venture Overseas Chinese Sugar Refinery, invested in by overseas Chinese and with a daily crushing capacity of 2,000 tons, will also start construction at the end of this month. A number of small sugar refineries with a daily crushing capacity of less than 100 tons will also begin construction successively.

    With the exception of the two large sugar refineries, Overseas Chinese and Huiyang, which will require construction over multiple years, the other factories under construction will be completed and put into production in the fourth quarter of this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广东省兴建几个制糖厂
    今年广东省地方制糖工业的基本建设已经开始。日榨量1，000吨的惠阳糖厂和日榨量各350吨的惠州糖厂、城月糖厂、长坡糖厂都已经动工。华侨投资的日榨量2，000吨的公私合营华侨糖厂也将在本月底动工，还有一批日榨量100吨以下的小型糖厂也将陆续动工。
    这些新建的糖厂除华侨、惠阳两个大型糖厂需要跨年度建成以外，其他各厂将在今年第四季度建成投入生产。　（新华社）
