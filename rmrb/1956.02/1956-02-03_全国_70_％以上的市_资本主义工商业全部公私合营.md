Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd—Currently, over 70% of cities and some county towns nationwide have fully realized joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, and the movement is continuing to develop towards county towns and market towns.

According to statistics from January 27th, 118 large and medium-sized cities (including municipalities directly under the central government and cities under provincial jurisdiction) and 193 county towns nationwide have fully implemented joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce. The people's committees of all provincial capitals in the country's 22 provinces, as well as the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur, have all completed the joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce. Most of the cities under the jurisdiction of these provinces and autonomous regions have also implemented joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce. Jiangxi Province, which has made relatively rapid progress, has already approved joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce in 64 out of its 82 counties.

Currently, the employees and capitalist personnel of the factories and stores that have already implemented joint state-private ownership are mostly engaged in asset inventory work, primarily in the form of capitalists' self-reporting and self-assessment, industry evaluation, and verification by the joint state-private ownership working committees.
