    The Trailblazers of the Lanxin Railway Construction
    By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong
    At the forefront of the Lanxin Railway construction, track-laying and construction workers are busy day and night; trucks transporting materials and supplies are speeding along the railway line; the roar of construction machinery engines echoes day and night; at night, the construction site is brightly lit, and the songs and calls of tens of thousands of workers converge into a magnificent symphony of labor.... With the hard work of the workers and engineering technicians, the railway has been laid to Qingshui in the Jiuquan area, 676 kilometers from Lanzhou.

    The construction speed of the Lanxin Railway has accelerated even further since the line opened to Zhangye in October 1955. The state originally decided to add 108 kilometers of track-laying, which was completed ahead of schedule in mid-December. The final increase of 30 kilometers of track-laying was also completed ahead of schedule. In total, the 1955 track-laying task was increased by nearly three-quarters compared to the original plan. In this way, the Lanxin Railway's five-year track-laying plan will be completed in 3 years and 8 months, i.e., in August of next year.

    In order to ensure the early completion of the five-year track-laying plan, the Lanxin Railway workers have demonstrated unparalleled enthusiasm and creativity, showing the working class's tenacious fighting spirit and boundless power to overcome difficulties. In 1955, the state decided to increase the track-laying task only after the Lanxin Railway was laid to Zhangye. The time was short, and the actual construction time was only two and a half months, moreover in the severe winter. West of Zhangye, the railway has to pass through many Gobi deserts, sand dunes, swamps, and lake beaches. Not far past Linze, the railway enters the Gaotai overflow area, which is usually dry and waterless, but when it rains, floods rush down from the mountains and overflow everywhere. Of course, there are many difficulties in construction under such natural conditions. However, the railway construction workers and engineering technicians fully realized the importance of completing the Lanxin Railway ahead of schedule. The comrades of the Northwest Design Bureau promptly provided design documents according to the construction needs. The First Engineering Bureau mobilized a large number of road construction machines such as water pumps, generators, and pile drivers; and mobilized thousands of trucks and horse-drawn carts to transport a large number of building materials to the construction site. The workers overcame the difficulties of severe cold, water shortage, and labor shortage. In the construction of the Shahe Bridge, Wu Jiping, an advanced worker and foreman of the First Engineering Bureau, studied with mechanical workers and adopted the construction method of excavating all bridge piers at once, replacing the originally planned 12 water pumps with three electric water pumps, reducing the difficulty of lacking water pumps, and ensuring the early completion of the bridge project. In the culvert and earthwork projects, the "double lifting and pushing over earth method" improved by the youth shock team of the Sixteenth Work Area reduced the time for each basket of earth overturned by six seconds. The shock team members cooperated closely with the civilian workers, using the foundation earthwork to fill the roadbed, greatly improving work efficiency, exceeding the national quota by more than one time. The workers of the spiking team launched a labor competition between shifts, groups, and day and night shifts to continuously overcome various difficulties and break through quotas in completing the track-laying task. The hammer workers were unwilling to stop working even when their hands were frostbitten in the cold of minus 15-16°. In December, the Gobi Desert was covered with heavy snow, but the workers still insisted on continuous day and night construction. The spiking team laid tracks in two shifts, day and night. The day shift got up at four o'clock every morning, and as soon as they saw the night shift workers, they would ask how many rails they had laid the night before. If the other party answered that they had laid two and a half kilometers, they would definitely ensure that they would also lay two and a half kilometers during the day, and they would not stop working until they had laid the same amount. Due to the selfless labor of the spiking workers, the track-laying efficiency was greatly improved. In the past, the average track-laying speed was 200 meters per hour, but now it has increased to 480 meters, setting the highest record since the Lanxin Railway track-laying began.

    On both sides of the Lanxin Railway line, the squeaking sounds of wheelbarrows, horse-drawn carts, and ox carts could be heard everywhere; the sounds of tampers were also rising and falling. The majority of this ocean-like crowd were civilian workers who came from various counties in the Hexi Corridor to support the road construction. The slogan they put forward was "We must send the train out of Gansu." The farmers along the line also vacated a large number of houses for the railway construction units to use as offices and for the families of the workers to live in. Every time the track-laying project reached a new place, farmers from dozens of miles away came to express their condolences. The farmers said, "When the train comes, we will get more new-style farm tools and technical assistance, the agricultural cooperation movement will be more heated, and agricultural production will increase faster."

    Soviet experts personally went to the construction site to conduct surveys and put forward dozens of valuable suggestions. For example, regarding the design of the Dashahe Bridge and culvert, they suggested reducing two bays of concrete beams, saving a lot of funds and shortening the construction time. The original plan was for the Heihe Bridge to be completed by the end of the year, with the track-laying project temporarily passing through a temporary bridge. Experts believed that it could be passed through the main bridge in advance to reduce engineering costs. The engineering team adopted effective measures based on the experts' suggestions, and as a result, the bridge was completed one month ahead of schedule. Experts also put forward opinions on changing the design of the roadbed project in places such as the Lijia Lake Beach. This has powerfully guaranteed the completion of the increased track-laying task.

    After the Lanxin Railway track-laying reached Qingshui in the Jiuquan area, a part of the road construction vanguard marched mightily towards Jiayuguan, the end of the Great Wall. In that uninhabited Gobi Desert, a large number of staff dormitories and automotive access roads are being built, and a large-scale concrete prefabricated factory is also under construction. The preparatory work for the Lanxin Railway construction this year has been largely completed, and the overall construction work has begun. The Lanxin Railway workers are making unremitting efforts to ensure the early completion of the five-year track-laying plan!

    兰新铁路的筑路先锋
    本报记者　康伟中
    在兰新铁路施工的最前方，筑路和铺轨工人日夜忙碌着；运送材料和物资的汽车在铁路沿线飞驰；筑路机器的马达声日夜轰鸣；入夜，工地灯光如昼，数万工人的歌声、号声汇成雄壮的劳动交响乐……。在工人和工程技术人员们的紧张劳动下，铁路已铺轨到酒泉地区的清水，距离兰州已有676公里了。
    兰新铁路的建设速度，从1955年10月通车到张掖后，更加快了。国家原决定增加108公里的铺轨工程，在12月中旬已经提前完成，最后增加30公里的铺轨任务，也提前完成了。总计1955年铺轨任务较原计划增加了将近四分之三。这样，兰新铁路的五年铺轨计划将在3年零8个月的时间内，即明年8月份完成。
    兰新铁路职工为保证提前完成五年计划的铺轨任务，发挥了无可比喻的积极性和创造性，表现出工人阶级顽强的战斗意志和克服困难的无穷力量。1955年，国家是在兰新铁路铺轨到张掖后才决定增加铺轨任务的，时间短促，除进行施工准备工作外，实际施工的时间只有两个半月，又是在严寒的冬天。在张掖以西，铁路要经过许多戈壁滩、沙丘、泥沼和湖滩地带。过临泽不远，铁路进入了高台漫流地带，这地方平时干涸无水，下雨时从山上奔泻下来的洪水到处漫流。在这样的自然条件下施工，困难当然是很多的。但是，修建铁路的职工和工程技术人员，充分认识到提前建成兰新铁路的重要意义。西北设计分局的同志们，根据施工需要及时地提出了设计文件。第一工程局调集了大量抽水机、发电机、打椿机等筑路机械；动员了上千辆的汽车和马车给施工现场运送大批建筑器材。职工们克服了严寒、缺水和劳动力不足的困难。在沙河大桥施工中，第一工程局的先进工作者、领工员吴寄萍同志，同机械工人研究，采取全部墩台一次挖通的施工方法，用三部电动抽水机代替了原计划的12台抽水机，减少了缺少抽水机的困难，保证了大桥工程提前完成。在涵管和土方工程中，十六工区青年突击队改进的“双抬猛推倒土法”，把每倒一筐土的时间缩短了六秒钟。突击队员们同民工紧密合作，利用基础土方填路基，工作效率大大提高，超过国家定额一倍以上。钉道队的工人们在完成铺轨任务中，展开了班同班，组同组、白班同夜班的劳动竞赛，不断克服各种困难，突破定额。打锤工人在零下15—16°的寒冷中，手冻裂了也不肯停止工作。12月的戈壁滩下着大雪，工人们仍坚持着日夜连续施工。钉道队分日夜两班铺轨，白天班每天早晨四点起床，一见夜班工人就问昨夜铺了多少轨。如果对方回答铺了两公里半，他们就一定保证白天也要铺两公里半，铺不到不收工。由于钉道工人的忘我劳动，铺轨效率大大提高，过去平均每小时铺200公尺，现在提高到480公尺，创造了兰新铁路铺轨以来的最高纪录。
    兰新铁路线的两边，到处都听到吱吱嘎嘎的独轮车、马车、牛车的声音；打夯子的号子声也此起彼落。这里海洋似的人群大部分是从河西走廊各县前来支援筑路的民工，他们提出的口号是“一定要把火车送出甘肃”，沿线农民还腾出大量的房子让铁路施工单位办公和职工家属们居住。铺轨工程每到一个新地方，数十里以外的农民都赶来慰问。农民们说：“火车来了，就使我们得到更多的新式农具和技术援助，农业合作化运动会搞得更热火，农业生产将提高得更快。”
    苏联专家亲自到施工现场进行勘察，提出了数十件宝贵的建议。例如对大沙河桥涵的设计，提出了减少两孔混凝土梁的建议，节约了很多资金，也缩短了施工时间。黑河大桥原计划年底完工，铺轨工程暂时由便桥通过，专家认为可以提前在正桥通过，以降低工程造价。工程队根据专家的建议，采取了有效措施，结果提前一个月建成了大桥。专家还对李家湖滩等处路基工程提出了改变设计的意见。这都有力地保证了新增铺轨任务的完成。
    兰新铁路铺轨到酒泉地区的清水后，一部分筑路先锋队浩浩荡荡地向万里长城的终点嘉峪关进军。在那荒无人烟的戈壁滩上，正在建筑大批职工宿舍和汽车便道，一座规模宏大的混凝土成品厂也正在建设中。今年兰新铁路施工准备工作大体已完成，全面施工工作已开始了。兰新铁路职工们正在为保证提前完成五年铺轨计划进行着不懈的努力！
