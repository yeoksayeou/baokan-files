I have read Premier Zhou Enlai's "Report on the Question of Intellectuals" made at the meeting convened by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In this conference, I have listened to the reports by Premier Zhou and President Guo Moruo. I understand the deep concern and expectations of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for intellectuals. I also know that after the collectivization of agriculture and handicrafts and the full public-private partnership of industry and commerce, the government will strengthen the unity, education, and transformation of intellectuals. This is truly wonderful news, and I wholeheartedly support it. I hope that our ranks of intellectuals, under the correct leadership and planned organization of the Party and the government, can greatly unleash their potential and complete the most glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party and the government within 12 years, so that each of us can be a healthy member of the future socialist society.

I study history. The so-called "historiography" of the old society, from today's perspective, was really just "historical source studies." However, even from the standpoint of historical source studies, given China's long history, vast territory, and large population, the richness of historical materials surpasses any other country in the world. Only the words "vast ocean" can describe it. In this area, we have much work to do, and in order to meet the needs of domestic farmers, workers, youth, and people of fraternal countries to understand Chinese national culture, we must do it quickly. I believe that this will definitely be listed as an important department in the 12-year plan.

The historical materials department can be roughly divided into three categories: antiquities, books, and legends. According to preliminary estimates, in terms of antiquities, focusing only on those inscribed with writing, there are approximately 200,000 pieces of oracle bones, approximately 5,000 pieces of bronzes, and approximately 100,000 pieces of inscriptions. Since liberation, a large number of antiquities have been discovered in basic construction projects in various places, which cannot be counted yet. In the future, with planned excavations, there will definitely be countless systematic new discoveries. In terms of books, there are approximately 200,000 kinds existing today. If we collect and compile the lost books, we can add at least another 10,000 kinds. As for legends, whether they are ancient events passed down from ancestors or modern events witnessed firsthand, almost everyone's mind preserves a living history. In the past hundred years, society has undergone earth-shattering changes, so the value of each living history stored in the mind will inevitably far exceed that of other eras. Speaking of our fraternal nationalities, their history written in records has mostly been distorted by the reactionary ruling class, and those living in remote areas may even have a blank slate. However, they still preserve a large number of legends in their own regions, which we should record and sort out urgently to enrich the history of our entire nation. In addition to general historical documents, there are also extremely rich materials in cultural heritage such as language, music, agriculture, handicrafts, medicine, hygiene, and various skills. It is even possible that the materials in a certain department are only mastered by one or two people in the entire country. In order to preserve our excellent cultural traditions and provide references for historical research, administration, and education, we must collect them urgently. If we relax for a period of time, we will inevitably face the risk of a large number of losses.

To collect and sort out these materials completely is, of course, the most ideal thing, but it is not easy to do in practice. Due to my age and professional background, I have thought of the following principles, which I would like to share now for the guidance of my comrades.

First, is to organize manpower. This is a large project, and it is impossible to carry out a comprehensive development without a large amount of manpower. The older generation of scholars focused their goals on literature and history, so the People's Government, in order to take care of them, established Research Institutes of Culture and History in various provinces and cities. This is precisely the manpower we should organize today for sorting out historical materials. However, it is not enough to organize manpower solely within the Research Institutes of Culture and History. One reason is that the number of places in the Research Institutes of Culture and History is limited, and it is impossible to recruit all the experts at once. Second, many experts are not yet 60 years old and do not meet the standards for members of the Research Institutes of Culture and History. Third, in the old era, there was a kind of person who practiced in seclusion, burying himself in work like a hermit. He did not seek recognition, and people did not know about him. Therefore, in order to carry out this large project and organize the manpower of the whole country, we must visit each place to ensure that no talented person with substance but without a reputation is buried.

Second, there must be meticulous processing. In the past, the reactionary element Wang Yunwu used the publishing organization of the Commercial Press to cater to the fashion of sorting out the national heritage, touting new-style punctuation, calculating pay by the page, and printing manuscripts as soon as they arrived without asking anyone to proofread them. Although he published a large number of books and achieved his business goals, the books were so full of errors that they made genuine readers feel headache. This was really a waste of resources and a poisoning of the academic community, which we must take as a warning. We know that sorting work often requires a research phase, and research work must rely on the combination of various conditions to reach conclusions, sometimes it cannot be rushed. Without proofreading, how can we be sure that it is this character? Without exegesis, how can we be sure that it is this meaning? If the characters and meanings cannot be determined, how can we punctuate? If we cannot punctuate, how can we translate? These tasks are a series of interconnected steps and cannot be done in isolation. Therefore, when we carry out this large project, the overall goal is, of course, to be many and fast, but each individual task must have a detailed processing plan, extending the working date, increasing the number of proofreaders and discussants, so that each book published can become a definitive or near-definitive edition.

Third, the cadres leading this work must understand the characteristics and history of this group of intellectuals. The vast majority of people doing this work are old intellectuals over the age of 50. Generally speaking, they are old, but in terms of academic work, they are just reaching the stage of maturity, which can be said to be their prime. In the old society, they held a non-utilitarian attitude, each choosing a small circle based on their own interests and academic abilities and delving into it. If they were poor, they could not exchange it for food, and if they succeeded, they would not receive rewards from the reactionary government. They were often despised by people in the old society as useless "bookworms." Their indifference to politics was, of course, a mistake from today's perspective, but they were unwilling to cater to the old forces and lived without security, so they were more or less oppressed. In this regard, they had the qualities of the working class. After liberation, they were shocked by the power of the great new society and naturally realized the necessity of self-transformation, but as they got older and their memory deteriorated, it was difficult for them to make rapid progress, and therefore they hesitated and wavered. I hope that the leading cadres will recognize the character and history of this special group of people, often use the method of "patient guidance" to solve their difficulties, dispel their concerns, and inspire their enthusiasm and creativity, so that they can correctly serve the people under the guidance of the Party. I further hope that Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, President Guo, and the heads of the State Bureau of Experts will use the method of inspecting agricultural production cooperatives to conduct several collective and individual visits to them, and organize regular visiting teams from among the existing staff to make rounds of inspections and offer warm greetings, so that they can participate in the work of the new society more happily under the excitement of bathing in glory. And the leadership will be more easily able to make appropriate arrangements, and can also discover and solve problems at any time. If we can do this, I believe that in the future, there will be many old people like Mr. Qi Baishi, who will win endless honors for our Chinese nation in world culture!

If the above words contain even a single correct idea from a thousand foolish thoughts, I think that the wise Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government must have already thought of it, and must have thought of it more thoroughly than I have. I only have the determination to support the government's policies, actively transform myself, and strive to shoulder the tasks assigned to me by the government in the cultural construction post!

    顾颉刚的发言
    我读了周恩来总理在中共中央召开的会议上所作的“关于知识分子问题的报告”，在本届大会里又听了周总理和郭沫若院长的报告，认识了中国共产党和人民政府对于知识分子的深切关怀和期待，又知道政府在农业、手工业的合作化和工商业的全行业公私合营之后，就要加强对于知识分子的团结、教育和改造。这真是一个天大的喜讯。我衷心地拥护。我希望我们知识分子的队伍能在党和政府的正确领导和有计划的组织之下，大量发挥潜力，在12年之内完成党和政府交给我们的最光荣的任务，使得我们每个人都不愧为将来的社会主义的社会中的健全分子。
    我是研究历史的，旧社会所谓的“史学”从现在看来实在只是“史料学”。然而就从史料学来说，以中国的立国之久，疆土之广，民族之众，历史资料的丰富超越了全世界的任何一国，只有“汪洋大海”四个字可以形容。在这一方面，我们大有工作可做，而且为了供应国内农、工、青年们和兄弟国家的人士认识中华民族文化的要求，更不得不赶快去做。我相信，在12年的规划里必然被列为一个重要的部门。
    历史资料这个部门，大概分作古物、书籍、传说三项。据初步估计，古物方面，单提刻上文字的，甲骨约20万片，铜器约5，000件，碑志约10万件。解放后各地方在基本建设工程里又发见大量的古物，现在还无法统计。将来作了有计划的发掘，一定更会有无数系统化的新发见。书籍方面，现存的大约有20万种，如果把已佚的书辑集起来至少还可以加上一万种。至于传说，或是祖先流传下来的古代事情，或是亲见亲闻的近代事情，差不多每一个人的脑子里都保存着一部活的历史。在这近百年中，社会天翻地复般突变，所以每一部藏在脑里的活历史的价值必然远远地超过了别的时代。说到我们的兄弟民族，他们的历史写在记载里的大都已被反动统治阶级所歪曲，其住居在偏僻地区的或者竟是一片空白；可是在他们自己的区域里还保存着大量的传说，我们急该记录出来，加以整理，充实我们全民族的历史。又，在一般历史文献以外的文化遗产，例如语言、乐音、农业、手工业、医药、卫生以及各种技巧，也有极丰富的资料，而且说不定某一部门的资料在全国内只有一两个人掌握着。为了保存我们优良的文化传统、供应历史的研究和行政及教育的参考，都不能不赶紧搜集。如果放松了一段时期，就不免有大量损失的危险。
    我们要把这些资料搜集完全，整理清楚，固然是最理想的事情，但实做起来并不容易。为了我的年龄关系和专业关系，想到了下面几项原则，现在说出来请求诸位同志指教。
    第一，是组织人力。这是一件大工程，非有大量的人力不能作全面的开展。老一辈的学者们的目标集中于文史，所以人民政府为了照顾他们而在各省市设立文史研究馆，这正是我们今天为了整理历史资料而应当组织起来的人力。但是单就文史馆中组织人力还嫌不够，一因文史馆名额有限，许多专家不可能一齐网罗？二则许多专家年龄不到60岁的，还不合于文史馆员的标准；其三，旧时代里有一种潜修的人，埋头工作，同苦行僧一样，他不求人知，人家也就不知道他。所以我们为要开展这件大工程，组织全国的人力，必须逐地访问，不埋没一个有其实而无其名的人才。
    第二，是要有细致的加工。从前反动分子王云五利用了商务印书馆的出版机构，迎合整理国故的风气，标榜新式标点，计页论酬，稿到就付印，绝不请人校勘，固然出了大量的书，达到了他做生意的目的，可是里头错得不成样子，使得真正读书的人看着就头痛。这实在是浪费物力，贻毒学界，是我们必须引为炯戒的。我们知道，整理工作常常需要经过研究的阶段，而研究工作又必须有待于种种配合的条件的凑合，方可得出结论，有时性急不来。没有校勘，怎么可以确定是这个字？没有训诂，怎么可以确定是这个意义？文字和意义不能确定，怎么可以标点？不能标点，又怎么可以翻译？这些工作是联串起来的一系列的步骤，决不能孤立地做。所以我们要开展这件大工程，总的目标固然是要多要快，但里边每一种个别工作必须定出细致的加工计划，把工作日期放宽些，校勘和讨论的人数加多些，使得每出一种书即可成为定本或接近于定本。
    第三，领导这个工作的干部们必须认识这一班知识分子的特性和历史。凡是做这项工作的人，绝大部分是50岁以上的旧知识分子。从一般说来，他们是老了，但在学术工作上说，则他们正到了成熟的阶段，可以说是壮年。他们在旧社会里抱着超功利主义，各人就自己的兴趣和学力所在，拣定了一个小圈子钻研下去，穷了不能换饭吃，成功了也得不到反动政府的奖励，常被旧社会里的人们鄙薄为无用的“书呆子”。他们不问政治，从现在看来固然是错误，但他们不肯去迎合旧势力，生活得不着保障，多多少少是些被压迫的分子，在这一点上说却有工人阶级的品质。解放以后，他们为伟大的新社会的动力所震荡，当然认识到自我改造的必要，可是上了年纪，记忆力差了，很难求有急速的进步，因此而踯躅彷徨。希望领导的干部们认清楚了这一类特殊人物的性格和历史，常常用“循循善诱”的方式来解决他们的困难，消释他们的顾虑，鼓起他们的积极性和创造力，使得他们在党的指导之下正确地为人民服务。更希望毛主席、周总理、郭院长和中国专家局的首长们用了视察农业生产合作社的方式来对他们作几次集体的和个别的访问，再就现有的工作人员里组织经常的访问队，巡回视察，作温暖的存问，使得他们在沐浴光辉的兴奋之下更愉快地参加新社会的工作。而领导上也就更容易作适当的支配，又可以随时发现问题，随时解决问题。能够这样地做去，我相信，将来必有很多类似齐白石先生的老年人，为我中华民族在世界文化里取得无穷的荣誉！
    以上的话，如果还有愚者千虑的一得，我想，英明的毛主席、中国共产党和人民政府必然都已想到，而且必然比我想得更周到。我惟有决心拥护政府的政策，积极改造自己，在文化建设岗位上努力担负起政府所交给我的任务！
