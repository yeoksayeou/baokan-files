Visiting Sholokhov
By our staff reporter Wang Xi

While Chinese readers are eagerly and joyfully devouring the chapters of the second part of "Virgin Soil Upturned," reuniting with Makar Nagulnov, the party branch secretary of Gremyachy village on the Don steppe—impetuous but infinitely loyal to the revolution—and sharing Davidov's joy and sorrow in his first love, we—the Chinese journalists—are also with the same excitement and joy sitting in the office of the editor-in-chief of Pravda, waiting to meet the great literary genius of our time, Sholokhov.

The door opened gently. We greeted a man of short stature, dressed in a brown Lenin suit and breeches, with a wide leather belt around his waist. Sholokhov strode forward. His thinning, light yellow curly hair was already mixed with some gray, but his sturdy frame and lively movements made you feel that he was still young.

The deputy editor-in-chief of Pravda introduced us. "This is the great modern writer." Sholokhov quickly stood up from his seat, raised his right hand to the top of his head, compared it to his own height, and said, "That should be corrected, you see, I am not great...". Humorous little sparks danced in his slightly gray blue eyes, and his reddish-white face became even rosier.

Sholokhov's name is inseparable from the Don River and the steppe. Since entering the literary world in the early 1920s, this talented writer has continuously used his unique artistic charm to present to the world's readers the various characters of the Don Cossacks in the great historical changes. He leads readers into the world of nature and human souls in which he lived. He is absolutely faithful to the truth of life, portraying reality from complex contradictions and conflicts. His works are full of revolutionary romanticism. The heroic figures he portrays, who have become representatives of an entire era, inspire millions to overcome difficulties, correct shortcomings, and advance with confidence in the victory of the people's cause; and the dregs of Soviet power that he lashes out at arouse people's common hatred and vigilance.

His masterpieces "And Quiet Flows the Don" and "Virgin Soil Upturned" are called the classic works of Soviet literature. Sholokhov, the writer and academician, is a representative of the Supreme Soviet in all sessions. In 1939, he was awarded the "Order of Lenin", in 1945, he was awarded the "Order of the Patriotic War, 1st Class", and last year, when he was 50 years old, he was awarded the "Order of Lenin" again for his achievements in literature.

We, with the spirit of exploring underground treasures, hope to explore some of the secrets of his creative life in this short meeting with him.

"You ask how a writer experiences life, how he draws creative themes from life? I live in the countryside, working as an ordinary party member. For me, there is no question of 'creative travel'. I don't need to go there to collect materials." Sholokhov began his talk in this way. Sholokhov often lives in the village of Vyoshenskaya on the Don River. This time he came to Moscow to attend the Supreme Soviet meeting. He lives among ordinary people, witnessing and participating in the life full of contradictions and changes in the Don region: the torrent of class struggle during the domestic war, the days when farmers initially opened up their narrow boundaries during collectivization, he was a witness to all of these.

He said: "During the collectivization movement, I was a member of the Party's district committee in the countryside, doing propaganda and mobilization work. I participated in meetings to discuss various issues, saw the peasants' firm aspirations for collectivization, and also saw the hesitation and wavering of some people; I saw great progress, and also saw various contradictions and shortcomings. I just write things and feelings that readers should know."

"A writer should use the truth of life to illustrate the issues he wants to write about. A writer who is not familiar with rural life may make mistakes if he writes about the countryside. If he writes about a person taking a sleigh to visit a village in winter, staying there for two hours, and then returning by carriage... the author forgot the snow on the road, he didn't travel himself. Readers will laugh when they see this mistake. If the author shows his ignorance when describing crops and agricultural machinery, it will not only make readers laugh, but also lose their trust. If we are to talk about experience, I think writers living in cities who want to write about the countryside should not take a hands-off attitude to look at the rapidly changing life in the countryside, but actively participate in the cooperative movement."

"How to resolve the contradiction between participating in work and creating?" We raised another question.

"The writer does not necessarily have to be the director of a cooperative. He will definitely not do such a thing well. The writer can participate in the Party's work in other ways, while also collecting materials. China probably also has propaganda mobilizers in the countryside, which is very suitable work."

"If Chinese writers participate in the movement during the high tide of cooperation, they will get detailed and vivid real materials, and get the images of fresh characters. If he loses such an opportunity, the image of the characters and the details of the events will be vague." Speaking of this, he mentioned his experience in creating "Virgin Soil Upturned." He said that the first part was written in the early stage of collectivization. At that time, he could not record all the materials in his notebook, and many were only kept in his mind. Twenty years later, when he continued to write the second part, he re-studied the newspapers, political reports and documents of the time, and re-read his own works, so that the things and human images of the past reappeared vividly.

Sholokhov, the great writer and representative of the Supreme Soviet, lives in his hometown of Vyoshenskaya village, but has established extensive contacts with people from all over the country. Not a day goes by that he does not receive many visitors. Even the passengers on ships sailing along the Don River are unwilling to miss the opportunity to send representatives to Sholokhov when the ship docks at the Vyoshenskaya pier. He receives countless letters every day stamped with the postmarks of cities and villages far away from the Don River. People raise all kinds of big and small things and problems to him, asking for his help in solving them.

"If I am away from home for two or three weeks, the letters and things from all sides will pile up and I will be too busy to handle them," he told us. He said that his working day is difficult to schedule. One day, when the sky was bright, he got up at 3:30 in the morning and went to the yard for a walk. A woman drove a cart pulled by two cows, with two buckets of gasoline on it, and walked towards him from a distance to greet him.

"Why did you come to me so early?"

The old lady said calmly, "I saw that you were already up, why should I wait? My cows don't have time to eat grass yet...".

"Receiving visitors and answering many letters takes up a lot of my time," Sholokhov said to us, "but this also broadens a writer's horizons and enriches his knowledge of life...". As early as when he was writing "And Quiet Flows the Don", Sholokhov already had close contact with the hardware workers in Leningrad. This, of course, greatly helped him to create the image of Davidov, enabling him to typify the excellent qualities of the Russian working class in Davidov. Sholokhov's meeting with a farmer in Nizhny-Yablonovsky village also enabled him to understand the truth of life more deeply. This middle peasant had just voluntarily joined the collective farm, and personally led a horse, two bulls and a cow to the public livestock pen, but later he could not eat well, nor could he sleep, and complained to people... The middle peasant did not become a laborer in socialist life all at once when he joined the collective farm. Sholokhov drew materials from him and created the image of the typical middle peasant Kondrat Maidannikov.

We asked him to talk about how to deal with cadres sent by the city to organize and lead the collectivization movement. Sholokhov said: Davidov is an image that comes from real life. "Every place has its own reality, and we must mainly proceed from reality. It is impossible to have a ready-made prescription." "I wrote that Davidov worked actively and diligently when he went to the countryside, but he encountered many difficulties, especially because he did not understand the people around him. He was busy doing organizational leadership work, but he did not deeply understand his task as a Party worker. In the beginning, he did not understand the sabotage activities of the rich peasants, and he was not vigilant enough.... I should focus on writing this point. I also wrote about his conversation with the blacksmith, which now seems superfluous, so I deleted it during the revision."

A serious attitude towards creation, and strict requirements for one's own works, are almost creeds for Sholokhov. He always revises his works again and again, carefully considering every sentence... He often uses very rude words to criticize those authors who are eager for quick success: "The books written by those who rush to be the first, fearing that others will step on their heels, are like little butterflies, with only one day of life." He said to us: "If a writer can suppress the feeling of dissatisfaction with his own works, it is better for him to give the shorthand manuscript to the publisher. ...Only those who love themselves the most, those who are complacent, are satisfied with their own works."

Sholokhov has written a full-length novel depicting the Russian soldiers fighting for their motherland in the Soviet Patriotic War. He is still revising it again and again, and will send it to the publisher for publication after it is more perfect. The proofs of the four volumes of "And Quiet Flows the Don" which are prepared to be included in his selected works are on his desk. He said: "The main revisions are in terms of language and rhetoric. I have changed many dialects and local words, and replaced them with standard common language, because I think that the readers of the book are the whole Soviet Union."

When we told him that Chinese readers love his two masterpieces very much, and many people read them many times and cannot bear to let go; and told him that Chinese literary and art workers all hope to learn from his creative experience, he quickly said: The best way is to learn from each other. "After hearing these good words from you, young people will become proud. There is a salvation for me, because I am already 50 years old, and age guarantees that I cannot be proud...".

He cares about the development of Chinese literature and announced to us: After he finishes writing the second part of "Virgin Soil Upturned", he will visit China, "At that time, I will definitely ask your writers more questions than you asked today. When I get to China, I will compete with you to see who asks more questions." His words made everyone laugh.

He said: "The great, talented and wise Chinese people will definitely create great literary works. Now you are moving forward." He criticized the publishing house for having a bias and liking to publish the works of old writers. Many excellent short story writers, their works are not well-known, only because the works are small in size. He said: "It is very meaningful to publish more works by young and promising writers. I hope that the Soviet Union will translate more Chinese short stories and works by young writers."

    访萧洛霍夫
    本报记者　汪溪
    当中国的读者正以激动喜悦的心情，贪馋地读着“被开垦的处女地”第二部的章节，同顿河草原上格内米雅其村的党支部书记——性情急躁但无限忠于革命的玛加尔·拉古尔洛夫重逢，又分担着达维多夫在初恋中的快乐和悲伤的时候，我们——中国的记者们，也以同样激动和喜悦的心情，坐在真理报总编辑的办公室里，等待着同当代伟大的文学天才萧洛霍夫会见。
    房门轻轻地开了。我们迎接着一位身个儿不大，穿着棕色列宁服和马裤，腰里系着宽皮带的人。萧洛霍夫阔步走上前来。略显稀疏的淡黄色卷发已经夹杂着些灰白了，可是他那结实的身躯和活泼的动作，使你感到他还年青。
    真理报副总编辑向我们介绍。“这是现代伟大的作家”。萧洛霍夫敏捷地从位子上站起来，把右手举到头顶上，比比自己的身个儿说：“应该纠正这句话，你们看，我并不伟大，……。”他那略带灰色的蓝眼睛里跳动着幽默的小火星，白里泛红的脸孔，更加红润了。
    萧洛霍夫的名字是和顿河、草原分不开的。自从二十世纪二十年代初进入文学界以来，这位天才的作家就不断地用他特有的艺术魅力把顿河哥萨克在巨大的历史变革里形形色色的人物，展现给世界的读者。他引领着读者进入他生活过的自然和人的灵魂的世界。他绝对忠实于生活的真实，从复杂的矛盾和冲突中去描写真实。他的作品充满着革命的浪漫主义情感。他笔下刻划的成为整个时代代表的英雄人物，鼓舞着千百万人去克服困难、改掉缺点，对人民事业的胜利满怀信心地前进着；而他鞭挞过的那些苏维埃政权下的渣滓，唤起着人们的同仇敌忾和警惕。
    他的巨著“静静的顿河”和“被开垦的处女地”被称为苏维埃文学的经典著作。作家和院士的萧洛霍夫是历届最高苏维埃代表。1939年他得过“列宁勋章”，1945年得过“卫国战争一级勋章”，去年，当他50岁的时候，他又以在文学上的功绩，再次得到“列宁勋章”。
    我们以勘探地下宝藏的心情，希望在同他的短促会见中，探索一些他的创作生活的秘密。
    “你们问作家怎样体验生活，怎样从生活里汲取创作的题材么？我住在农村里，作为一个普通的党员工作着，对于我来说，不发生‘创作旅行’的问题，我用不到到那里去搜集材料。”萧洛霍夫这样开始了他的谈话。萧洛霍夫经常住在顿河上的维约申斯克村里，这次是为了参加最高苏维埃会议才到莫斯科来的。他生活在普通人民之中，目睹并参加了顿河地区充满了矛盾和变革的生活：国内战争时期阶级斗争的激流，集体化时期农民最初打开狭窄的地界的日子，他都是见证人。
    他说：“在集体化运动时期，我在农村里是党的区委委员，作着宣传鼓动工作。我参加过讨论各种问题的会议，看到农民对集体化坚定的向往，也看到了一些人的犹豫动摇；我看到了巨大的前进，也看到了各种矛盾和缺点。我就写出读者要知道的事情和感情。”
    “作家要用生活的真实说明他要写的问题。一个不熟悉农村生活的作家去描写农村，就可能发生错误。如果他写一个人在冬天坐着雪撬到村子里去作客，在那儿呆了两个钟头，又坐马车回来……作者忘记了路上的积雪，他自己并没有旅行。读者看到了这个错误，就会发笑。如果作者在描写农作物和农作机器时表现了自己的无知，就不只引读者发笑，而且会失去读者的信任的。如果要谈什么经验，我认为生活在城市里的作家，想要写农村，就不能用袖手旁观的态度去看农村正在激变着的生活，而是要积极地参加合作化运动。”
    “怎样解决参加工作和创作的矛盾呢？”我们又提出了问题。
    “作家不一定要作合作社主任。这样的事，他一定搞不好的。作家可以用另外的方法参加党的工作，一方面又搜集材料。中国农村大概也有宣传鼓动员，这是很适合的工作。”
    “如果中国作家在合作化高潮的时候就参加运动，他就会得到细致的鲜明的真实材料，得到新鲜人物的形象。如果他失去了这样的机会，人物的形象，事情的细节，都会是模模糊糊的。”说到这里，他提到了自己创作“被开垦的处女地”的经验。他说，第一部是在集体化初期写的。当时他不能把所有的材料都记在本子上，许多只保留在脑子里。二十年后，在继续写第二部的时候，他就重新研究当时的报纸、政治报告和文件，并且重看自己的作品，使过去的事物和人的形象又鲜明地显现了出来。
    伟大的作家和最高苏维埃代表的萧洛霍夫，住在家乡维约申斯克村，却和全国各地的人建立着广泛的联系。没有一天他不接见许多来访的客人的。就连沿着顿河航行的轮船上的旅客，当船停泊在维约申斯克码头上时，也不愿错过派代表到萧洛霍夫那里去的机会。他每天不知要接到多少封盖着远离顿河的城市和农村邮局戳记的信。人们把各种各样或大或小的事情和问题，向他提出，请他帮助解决。
    “我如果有两三个星期不在家，各方面的信件和事情就会堆得忙不过来的。”他告诉我们。他说，他的工作日是很难按时间表安排的。有一天，天才亮，早晨3点半他就起床到院子散步。一个女人赶着两头牛拉的车子，上面放着两桶汽油，远远地走向前来和他打招呼。
    “你为什么这样早来找我啊？”
    老太太不慌不忙地说：“我看你已经起床了，为什么还要等呢？我的牛还来不及吃草呢……。”
    “接待来访者，答复许多来信是要占去我很多时间的”，萧洛霍夫对我们说，“但是这又使一个作家开眼界，生活知识更加丰富……。”早在写“静静的顿河”的年代，萧洛霍夫就已经和列宁格勒的五金工人有了密切的联系。这，当然对他创造达维多夫的形象有极大帮助，使他能在达维多夫身上典型化了俄国工人阶级的优秀品质。萧洛霍夫在尼日尼—雅勃洛诺夫斯克村同一个农民的会见，也曾使他更深地了解生活的真实。这个中农刚刚自愿加入集体农庄，亲自把一匹马、两只公牛和一只母牛牵到公共畜栏去，可是他后来吃不好，又睡不着觉，向人发牢骚……。中农加入集体农庄，并不是一下子就成为社会主义生活中的劳动者的。萧洛霍夫从他身上汲取材料，创造了典型的中农康德拉脱·梅谭尼可夫的形象。
    我们请他谈谈怎样处理城市派去组织领导集体化运动的干部。萧洛霍夫说：达维多夫是从实际生活里出来的形象。“各地有各地的实际，主要地要从实际出发，不可能有个现成的药方的”。“我写达维多夫下乡工作虽然积极苦干，但碰到许多困难，特别是他还不了解周围人物。他忙于做组织领导工作，但他没有深刻地了解他做为党的工作者的任务。开始他对富农的破坏活动没有了解，警惕不够……。我应该集中写出这点。我又写了他和铁匠的谈话，现在看来是多余的，在修改时我便把它删掉了。”
    创作的严肃态度，对自己作品要求的严格，对于萧洛霍夫几乎是信条。他总是三番五次地修改作品，推敲着每一句话……。他常用很不客气的话批评那些急于求成的作者：“那些匆忙抢先、怕别人踩了他的脚后跟的人写出来的书，就像小蝴蝶一样，只有一天寿命。”他对我们说：“如果作家能压下去对自己作品的不满的心情，不如让他把速记稿交给出版社。……只有最爱自己的人，自满的人，才满意自己的作品。”
    萧洛霍夫已写好了一部描写苏联卫国战争中俄罗斯士兵为祖国而战的长篇。他还在一遍又一遍地修改着，使它更加完善以后，才会送到出版社去出版。准备编入他的选集的“静静的顿河”四卷的清样正放在他的书桌上。他说：“主要的修改是在语言和修辞方面的，我把许多土语和地方话改掉，用标准的普通语言来代替，因为我想到，书的读者是全苏联的。”
    当我们告诉他，中国读者很喜爱他的两部巨著，有不少人看多次而不忍释手；告诉他：中国的文艺工作者都希望学习他的创作经验时，他忙说：最好的办法是互相学习。“听了你们这些好话，年青人会骄傲起来的。对我有个挽救，因为我已经50岁，年龄保证我不能骄傲……。”
    他关心着中国文学事业的发展，并对我们宣布：当他写完“被开垦的处女地”第二部以后，他要来访问中国，“那时，我一定向你们的作家提出比你们今天提出的更多的问题，到中国时，我将和你们比赛，看谁提出的问题多”。他的话把大家都引得发笑了。
    他说：“伟大的天才的智慧的中国人民一定能创造伟大的文学作品的。现在你们正在向前迈进。”他批评出版社有一种偏向，喜欢出版老作家的作品。许多优秀的短篇小说作者，他们的作品不大出名，只因为作品是小型的。他说：“多出版些年青的有前途的作家的作品是很有意义的。希望苏联多译一些中国的短篇小说和青年作家的作品。”
