    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    With utmost excitement, I participate in this grand and historically significant meeting amidst the great socialist upsurge of our motherland. I have studied Premier Zhou's political report, President Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of socialist revolution, as well as other reports by various leaders, and have received great education, boundless excitement, and encouragement. In his political report, Premier Zhou called on us to catch up with the world's advanced levels of science and culture within 12 years. This is the great and glorious combat mission given to us by the Party, and it is the goal we strive for in the great socialist construction. Therefore, the five specific requirements put forward by President Guo—contributing strength, expanding the ranks, raising the level, self-education, and strengthening unity—are our program of action for the next 12 years.
    I am a teacher at an engineering college, and therefore, cultivating and expanding the ranks of socialist intellectuals is a glorious responsibility I should bear. Judging from the teaching situation at Dalian Institute of Technology, where I work, the quality of teaching has gradually improved during the process of teaching reform. However, compared with the rapidly developing situation of socialism in our motherland today, it is still far behind. This requires a rapid improvement in the scientific level of teachers. However, my own understanding of the requirements for cultivating new forces is insufficient, and conservative ideas exist, especially in organizing existing teachers to carry out scientific research, improve scientific levels, and cultivate graduate students. We have not yet organized the majority of teachers to participate in scientific research work, and we also believe that the strength of the teaching and research department is limited and can only be responsible for a very small number of graduate students. This cannot meet the requirements of the development of the situation. This makes me realize even more that I must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, observe and solve problems with a dialectical materialist viewpoint, and accelerate the pace of work to adapt to the requirements of the development of the situation. Only by improving awareness and correct thinking methods can strength be fully exerted and grown, and can teaching quality and scientific level be rapidly improved under overall planning.
    At present, our scientific level is still very low, and the strength of scientific research is very weak. But I firmly believe that with the Party's overall planning and specific leadership, and with the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, as long as we can fight tenaciously, we can achieve this goal. Judging from the teaching reform work of our teaching and research department of organic dyes and intermediates, with the help of Soviet experts, collective learning of Soviet teaching experience has comprehensively implemented the teaching plan two years ahead of schedule. In the 1954 academic year, all students formally carried out graduation design and theses, and the quality of teaching has improved. Similarly, scientific research work can also be rapidly advanced. On the basis of teaching reform, we have initially started scientific research work. In order to improve the scientific level of the entire collective, organizing collective scientific research is a better way. On the one hand, we can divide labor according to different contents within the same scope, and on the other hand, we can divide labor according to the level of specific work. In this way, everyone plays a role, and also cultivates the ability to work independently, improves the existing level, and greatly accelerates the research speed. At the same time, forming a collective can help and supervise each other, and gradually launch academic discussions. There will also be great gains in academic views and academic thoughts. Organizing collective research, although different from agricultural cooperation in specific issues, is the same in essence in terms of exerting potential strength. In addition, we must, on the one hand, combine teaching, and on the other hand, combine relevant research institutions, and strive to undertake certain tasks under the general plan of scientific research. Strive for the help of domestic experts and Soviet experts, organize teachers to carry out scientific research work while completing teaching tasks and improving teaching quality, cultivate graduate students, improve scientific levels, and strive to train more teachers with the level of cultivating experts.
    At the time when the Party calls on us to march towards science, I, with the greatest determination and confidence, and with the most intense efforts, under the leadership of the Party and higher authorities, and together with my comrades, will certainly not fail the mission of this era, and will certainly strive to study Marxism-Leninism, comprehensively and responsibly implement the education policy of comprehensive development, and send excellent intellectuals to research and enterprise departments for the motherland. It is necessary to scientifically arrange time, overcome difficulties, exert collective strength, carry out scientific research work, improve the collective scientific level, and cultivate more graduate students. Similarly, it is necessary to temper oneself in practice to have the tenacity to dedicate one's whole life to the great cause, and to make every effort to achieve the goal of the motherland's science and technology reaching the international advanced level.

    侯毓汾的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我以万分兴奋的心情，在祖国伟大的社会主义高潮中，参加了具有历史意义的盛大会议，学习了周总理的政治报告、郭沫若院长的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告以及各位首长的其他各项报告，得到了很大教育，无限的兴奋和鼓舞。周总理在政治报告中号召我们在12年内赶上世界先进科学文化水平，这是党给我们的伟大光荣的战斗任务，是我们在伟大的社会主义建设中的奋斗目标。因此，郭院长提出的贡献力量、扩大队伍、提高水平、自我教育、加强团结五项具体要求，也就是我们在今后12年内的行动纲领。
    我是一个工学院的教师，因此培养和扩大社会主义知识分子队伍是应负的光荣责任。以我所在的大连工学院的教学情况来看，我们在教学改革过程中教学质量逐步有所提高，但是与祖国今天社会主义飞跃发展的形势相比，还是远远落后。这就必须教师的科学水平迅速提高。但是我自己在培养新生力量的要求上，认识很不足，存在着保守思想，尤其表现在组织现有教师展开科学研究工作、提高科学水平和培养研究生的问题上。我们还没有组织大多数的教师到科学研究工作中去，也还认为教研室力量有限，只能担负极少数的研究生，这是不能符合形势发展的要求的。这使我更体会到，必须认真学习马克思列宁主义，以辩证唯物主义观点观察和解决问题，加速工作速度来适应形势发展的要求。只有提高觉悟和正确的思想方法，力量才能够得到充分发挥和成长，才能在全面规划下，迅速提高教学质量和科学水平。
    目前，我们的科学水平还很低，科学研究的力量很薄弱。但我坚信，有党的全面规划和具体领导，有苏联的全面帮助，只要我们能顽强奋斗，我们是可以实现这一奋斗目标的。从我们有机染料及中间体专业教研室教学改革工作的情况看，在苏联专家帮助下，集体的学习苏联教学经验，已提前两年全面贯彻了教学计划。1954学年度全部学生正规地进行了毕业设计和论文，教学质量都有提高。同样，科学研究工作，也是同样可以迅速迈进的。我们在教学改革的基础上，初步开始了科学研究工作，为了要使整个集体的科学水平提高，组织起来集体展开科学研究是较好的方式。一方面可以在同一范围按不同内容分工，另一方面可以按具体工作水平分工。这样，每一个人发挥了作用，也培养了独立工作能力，提高了现有水平，使研究速度大大加速。同时，组成集体来进行，可以互相帮助督促，并可逐步展开学术讨论。在学术观点、学术思想上收获也会很大。组织集体研究，虽然与农业合作化在具体问题上有所不同，但发挥潜在力量，实质是一样的。此外，我们必须一方面结合教学，一方面结合有关研究机关，在科学研究总计划下争取担任一定任务。争取国内专家和苏联专家的帮助，在完成教学任务、提高教学质量的同时，组织教师展开科学研究工作，培养研究生，提高科学水平，并争取能培养更多的教师，具有培养专家的水平。
    在党号召我们向科学大进军的时候，我以最大的决心和信心，以最紧张的努力，在党和上级领导下，和同志们在一起，一定不辜负这个时代的使命，一定努力学习马克思列宁主义，全面负责贯彻全面发展的教育方针，为祖国培养优秀的知识分子送到研究和企业部门。要科学地安排时间，克服困难，发挥集体力量，展开科学研究工作，提高集体的科学水平，培养更多的研究生。同样要在实践中锻炼自己具备为伟大事业献出整个生命的顽强性，为实现祖国的科学技术达到国际先进水平的目标尽一切的努力。
