    New Village of the Oroqen People
    Peng Fengye
    The Oroqen people, who have long lived a nomadic hunting life in the dense forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains in northern China, have now begun to settle down. In the formerly desolate mountains and fields, new houses have been built one after another. New settled villages of the Oroqen people have appeared in the Khingan Mountains.
    Last winter, I traveled from Hailar, a grassland city in Inner Mongolia, to visit the Oroqen Autonomous Banner. It was a tense time for forest fire prevention. Seeing the hunters' enthusiasm for patrolling the mountains day and night to guard the forests of the motherland, seeing their bravery and resourcefulness in hunting and production, and seeing their joy after moving to the new villages, I deeply felt that the lives of the Oroqen people were undergoing profound changes.
    To go to the Oroqen Autonomous Banner from Hailar, you have to detour through the Morin Dawa Banner. From the Morin Dawa Banner to the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, there are still two hundred and some li of mountain road. We traveled by large-wheeled horse-drawn carts, and all along the way we saw mountains connected to mountains, with dense thickets of small trees covering the peaks. It was not until the afternoon of the third day that we arrived at Xiaoergou, the seat of the People's Committee of the Autonomous Banner.
    Several years ago, this was still a barren grassland. Since the establishment of the Autonomous Banner, its appearance has gradually changed. Now, more than 300 neat bungalows have been built on the open space by the Nuomin River. There are supply and marketing cooperatives, people's banks, health clinics, Oroqen primary schools, and postal and telecommunications institutions. This new Oroqen town has now become the political, economic, and cultural center of the Autonomous Banner.
    Every morning, hunters' horses are tethered in front of the cooperative. Hunters from nearby Gaolu (villages) crowd into the sales department to select the grain, cloth, daily necessities, and gunpowder and lead bullets they need. These goods come from all over the motherland, and the Oroqen people living in the deep mountains and forests receive the support of people of all ethnic groups. Medical personnel from the Oroqen Autonomous Banner Health Clinic often patrol the mountains and forests of the Khingan Mountains, serving the hunters day and night. In the past, diseases such as smallpox and typhoid fever, which endangered lives in this area, have been brought under control. There are more than one hundred children studying in the Oroqen Primary School. Settled life has given the children of the Oroqen people, who have long been scattered in the mountains and fields, better access to education. The children are all wearing neat new cotton clothes. More than 60 people in the school have joined the Young Pioneers and become members.
    Along the Nuomin River, we traveled north from Xiaoergou to visit Nuomin New Village, where the Oroqen people had settled down not long ago. The mountains along the way are covered with forests, with no villages or houses. On the first day, we chose a grove of oak trees to stay overnight. In the evening, a hunter with a gun on his back and a hunting dog came to our resting place. It turned out that he was from Nuomin New Village and was a forest ranger on his way home. So we became companions. That night, around the campfire, he told me about the joy of the Oroqen hunters after moving to the new village. He said that the new houses had glass windows and stoves, were bright and warm, and everyone was very happy and excited and couldn't sleep. He also described the outline of the new village. I also spent a cold night in the mountains with excitement. In the next two days, we continued to walk through several mountains and forests and grasslands until we reached a small hilltop closest to the new village, and finally saw a row of neat new houses on the flat grassland in front of us. This is Nuomin New Village. The Nuomin River surrounds the south side of the village. The river is clear, and deciduous trees grow on the embankment. The north and east of the village are undulating mountains. Between the mountains and the village is a wide dam where the hunters' horses graze leisurely. The Oroqen people, who have been migrating and hunting in this area for many years, have chosen this flat land nestled against the mountains and near the water to settle down.
    I visited several Oroqen people's new homes. The hunters have tidied up their new homes very cleanly. The houses are designed according to their wishes. The outer room is the kitchen, the inner room is the dormitory, with a heated kang and a wooden bed, as well as a stove for boiling tea. Mao Zedong's portrait is hanging on the wall, as well as hunting guns and cartridge belts. Various floral cotton quilts and wool blankets are stacked on the kang. Enamel and aluminum utensils have replaced birch utensils. The hunters told me that in the past long years, they could not wear a cotton cloth garment or cover themselves with a cotton quilt all year round. Now, from the furnishings in the new house, it can be seen that the lives of the Oroqen people are rising day by day.
    The winter in the Khingan Mountains changes quickly. After a night of cold wind, bright ice ridges floated on the Nuomin River. Those days, the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast temperature drops and gale forecasts every day. In the past, even in colder weather than this, they had to huddle in tents called "Xierenzhu." These were conical sheds made of birch wood, covered with bark or animal skins, with some dry grass and hides laid inside, and a hole at the top for light. During nomadic migrations, the Oroqen people spent one winter after another in such rudimentary tents. Now, the people living in the new village heat their kangs and beds, and are no longer afraid of the cold in the warm houses. The strong wind shakes the ancient trees in the Khingan Mountains, while the Oroqen people living in the new village quietly listen to music and operas in the radio room of the Nutuk (district) People's Committee. The hunters love their new life. The government has sent a working group to help them settle down. The hunters have learned many things they had never experienced before. Every morning, women carry water buckets to fetch water from the newly dug wells, and they no longer have to brave the severe cold to break the ice on the river to get water. During the day, the hunters drive horse-drawn carts back and forth to pull sheep grass, and they have to pile up the horse feed before the snow accumulates. Later, I learned that for the long-term nomadic Oroqen people, even fetching water and driving horse-drawn carts were new things.
    Winter is the peak season for hunters. After settling down, whenever the hunters go to the mountains to patrol and hunt in teams, the elderly, women, and children do not have to move and run around. I visited Man Qingshan, an old hunter with more than 40 years of hunting experience. There are eight people in his family. In the past, whether it was rainy or severe winter, with hunting and production, he often led his whole family, men, women, old and young, to move in the mountains, sometimes moving several times a year. These days, his eldest son, Danbu, has gone out hunting. Man Qingshan and his wife, daughter-in-law, and grandson are reunited in the warm house, living a harmonious and happy life. That day, his daughter-in-law was rushing to make roe deer skin gloves, and his grandson was sleeping soundly in the cradle. He told me that his youngest son and daughter were studying at the Oroqen Primary School.
    Every evening, when the joyful barking of hunting dogs sounds in the distance, and the clatter of hooves comes into the village, it is the people who went out to patrol the mountains and hunt bringing back the spoils of victory on their horses. At this time, women and children come out of the houses to greet the returning hunters, and a joyful sound rings out in the quiet mountain village.

    鄂伦春人的新村
    彭逢烨
    在我国北部大兴安岭的丛山密林中，长期过着游猎生活的鄂伦春人，现在已经开始实行定居。在从前满目荒凉的山野间，兴盖了一座座崭新的房屋。兴安岭里出现了鄂伦春人定居的新村。
    去年冬天，我从内蒙古的草原城市海拉尔出发，到鄂伦春自治旗访问。那时正是护林防火的紧张时节。看到猎民们昼夜巡山放哨守卫祖国森林的热情，看到他们打猎生产时的英勇机智，又看到他们搬到新村后的喜悦，我深深地感到鄂伦春人的生活正在起着深刻的变化。
    从海拉尔去鄂伦春自治旗，要绕道莫力达瓦旗。莫力达瓦旗到鄂伦春自治旗还有两百几十里的山路。我们乘坐着大轮马车赶路，一路上但见山峦相连，山顶上布满了密密丛丛的小树林。第三天下午，才到达了自治旗人民委员会的所在地小二沟。
    几年以前，这里还是一个荒草滩。自治旗建立以后，才逐渐改变了它的面貌。现在，诺敏河边的旷地上，已经盖起300多间整齐的平房。这里有供销合作社、人民银行、卫生院、鄂伦春小学和邮电机构。这个鄂伦春人的新集镇，现在已经成为自治旗的政治、经济和文化中心。
    每天早晨，合作社门前缚着猎人的马匹。来自附近高鲁（村）的猎人，拥挤在门市部里，选购他们需要的粮食、布匹，
  日用品和打猎用的火药、铅弹。这些货物来自祖国各地，住在深山密林中的鄂伦春人，得到了各族人民的支援。鄂伦春自治旗卫生院的医务人员们，经常巡回在兴安岭的山林中，日夜为狩猎的人服务。过去在这个地区危害人命的天花、伤寒等疫病已经被控制住了。鄂伦春小学里有一百几十名儿童在学习。定居生活使得长期游散在山野间的鄂伦春人的孩子们得到了更好的受教育的机会。儿童们都穿着整齐的新棉衣。全校已经有60多人带上红领巾，成为少年先锋队的队员了。
    沿着诺敏河，我们从小二沟北行，去访问不久以前才定居下来的鄂伦春人的诺敏新村。沿途遍山林木，没有村落，也没有人家。第一天，我们选择了一片柞树林住宿。傍晚，一个背枪的猎民，带着一只猎狗来到我们休息的地方。原来他就是诺敏新村的人，是一个护林员，正要赶回家去。于是我们成了同伴。这天晚上，围着篝火，他向我讲述了鄂伦春猎民在搬到新村后的喜悦。他说，新房子有玻璃窗、有火炉子，又明亮、又暖和，大家都很高兴，兴奋得睡不着觉。他还描画了这个新村的轮廓。我也怀着兴奋的心情，度过了山野的寒夜。以后两天，我们继续走过几个山林和草地，直到距离新村最近的一个小山头，终于看到了前面平坦的草地上，一排整齐的新屋，这就是诺敏新村。诺敏河环绕在村庄的南边，河水清澈，堤岸上长着落叶树。村北和村东都是起伏的山峦，山、村之间有一片广阔的平坝，猎民的马匹悠闲地啃嚼着牧草。连年来在这一带迁徙游猎的鄂伦春人，选定了这块依山傍水的平地定居下来了。
    我访问了几户鄂伦春人的新居。猎民们把他们的新屋收拾得很干净。屋子是按照他们的意愿设计的。外屋是厨房，里屋是宿舍，有暖炕也有木板床，还有烧茶用的火炉子。墙上挂着毛主席的像，此外便是猎枪和弹袋。炕上叠着各种花布棉被和绒线毯子。搪瓷和铝制用具代替了桦木用具。猎民们告诉我，在过去漫长的岁月里，他们终年穿不上一件棉布衣服，盖不到一床棉被。现在从新屋里的陈设，可以看出鄂伦春人的生活正在一天比一天上升。
    兴安岭的冬天变化很快，一夜寒风，诺敏河上便飘起亮晶的冰凌来了。那些天，中央人民广播电台每天都播送降温和大风预告。要是在过去，就是在比这更冷的天气，他们只得蜷缩在称作“歇仁柱”的帐棚里。那是用桦木搭盖起来的圆椎形棚架，上面覆盖着树皮或兽皮，棚里铺些干草、皮张、顶上还有一个通亮光的孔穴。在游猎迁移的时候，鄂伦春人就是在这样设备简陋的帐棚里，熬过一个又一个冬天的。现在，住在新村里的人，烧暖了他们的炕床，在温暖的屋子里已不再怕严寒的侵袭。劲风摇撼着兴安岭里的千年老树，而住在新村里的鄂伦春人却安静地在努图克（区）人民委员会的收音室里收听着音乐和戏曲。猎民们热爱他们的新生活。政府曾派了工作组来帮助他们安置家园。猎民们学会了许多以前从没有经历过的事。每天早晨，妇女们担着水桶到新掘的水井汲水，她们不必再冒着严寒去掘开河上的冰层打水了。白天，猎民们赶着马车，来回拉羊草，他们要在积雪前把马的饲草堆好。后来我才知道，对于长期游猎的鄂伦春人，就是打水、驾马车这些事情，也是新鲜的。
    冬天是猎民狩猎的旺季。在定居以后，每当猎民们结队到山林里巡山打猎的时候，老人、妇女和小孩不必跟着流动奔波了。我访问了有着40多年打猎经验的老猎手满青山。他家里大小八口人。在过去，不论是雨天和严冬，随着打猎生产，他常领着全家男女老小，在山林中游动，有时一年就要搬几次家。这几天，他的大儿子单布出去打猎去了，满青山和他的妻子、儿媳以及孙儿，一家人团聚在暖屋里，过着融融乐乐的生活。这天，他的儿媳正在赶制狍皮手套，孙儿熟睡在摇车里。他告诉我，他的小儿子和女儿都在鄂伦春小学读书。
    每天傍晚，当远处响起猎狗欢叫的声音，得得的马蹄传进村里，这就是出去巡山围猎的人们携带着猎获的胜利品快马归来了。这时，妇女们、儿童们都从屋子里出来迎接归来的猎人，安静的山村，响起一片欢腾的声音。
