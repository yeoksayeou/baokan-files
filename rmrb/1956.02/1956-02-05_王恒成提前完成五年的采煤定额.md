    Wang Hengcheng Completes Five-Year Coal Mining Quota Ahead of Schedule
    (Our newspaper, Benxi, 4th) Wang Hengcheng, a model worker in Liaoning Province and a coal miner at Benxi Coal Mine, had mined 13,683 tons of coking coal in 3 years and 22 days by January 22nd, completing the 5-year coal mining quota more than a year ahead of schedule. He is now carrying out the production tasks for 1958 and has proposed a new guarantee for completing the plan ahead of schedule.
    (Our newspaper, Benxi, 4th) After learning from the advanced experiences of Wang Hengcheng, a model worker in Liaoning Province, such as not wasting working hours, fully utilizing the efficiency of pneumatic picks, and performing regular cyclic operations, the workers of Benxi Coal Mine have improved labor efficiency. The entire mine has also saved 129 laborers, who have been sent to support units such as Caitun Coal Mine.
    After learning from Wang Hengcheng's advanced experience, the second coal mining district of Benxi Coal Mine shortened the auxiliary production time, and the average production efficiency of each worker increased from 4.8 tons per day to 6 tons. In the past, Zhao Yuming's team in the fifth coal mining district had 60 people and a daily output of 270 carts of raw coal. After learning from Wang Hengcheng's advanced experience, only 40 people were needed to complete the original task. The electromechanical department, which previously felt unable to complete its tasks, has not only been able to complete its tasks since learning from Wang Hengcheng's experience of fully utilizing working hours, but has also extracted more than 60 workers to support production in other departments.

    本报本溪4日电　辽宁省工业劳动模范、本溪煤矿采煤工人王恒成，到1月22日止，用3年零22天的时间，采出了13，683吨炼焦煤，提前1年多完成了5年的采煤定额。现在他正在执行着1958年的生产任务，并且提出了新的提前完成计划的保证。
    本报本溪4日电　本溪煤矿工人学习辽宁省工业劳动模范王恒成的不浪费工时、充分发挥风镐效率、正规循环作业等先进经验后，提高了劳动效率，全矿还节省出129个劳动力，去支援彩屯煤矿等单位。
    本溪煤矿第二采煤区学习了王恒成的先进经验后，缩短了辅助生产时间，平均每个工人的生产效率由日产量4.8吨提高到6吨。第五采煤区赵玉明班，过去60个人，日产量是270车原煤，学习了王恒成的先进经验后，只用40个人就能完成原来的任务。过去感到不能完成任务的机电部门，自从学习了王恒成的充分利用工时的经验后，不仅能够完成任务，而且还抽出了60多个工人，支援其它部门生产。
