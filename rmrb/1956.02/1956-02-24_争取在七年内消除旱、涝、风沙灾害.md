Strive to Eliminate Drought, Flood, and Sandstorm Disasters in Seven Years

Deng Quanlun, Head of the Agricultural Science Department of Yuanyang County, Henan Province

Yuanyang County, Henan Province, has a total cultivated land area of 1.31 million mu, of which 560,000 mu are sandy loam soil, accounting for 43% of the total cultivated land; 460,000 mu are sandy soil, accounting for 35% of the total cultivated land; and 290,000 mu are saline-alkali soil, accounting for 22% of the total cultivated land. The county experiences frequent winds in winter and spring, summer droughts, and autumn floods, resulting in extremely severe drought, flood, and sandstorm disasters. According to investigations, a 6 to 7 grade wind can blow away approximately 7.5 million cubic meters of fertile soil from the surface of 460,000 mu of sandy land within 24 hours. From 1951 to 1955, the county suffered from floods for four years, windstorms for two years, drought for one year, and frost for one year. In 1952, the annual rainfall was only 140 mm, and more than 1.2 million mu of autumn fields across the county suffered from widespread drought. In July and August 1954, rainfall reached 459 mm, inundating 590,000 mu of autumn fields, accounting for 52% of the autumn field area. Due to severe natural disasters and soil degradation, yields were extremely low. In 1949, the average yield per unit area of ​​grain crops was only 77 jin. In 1955, the average yield per unit area only reached 89 jin.

With the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the county began a mass tree planting and afforestation, water conservancy construction, and soil and water conservation movement in 1952. In the past four years, a total of 25,558 mu of forest have been planted, including 110 agricultural field protection forest belts, with 3.43 million trees planted. It is estimated that after the forest belts mature, they can protect 470,000 mu of farmland. The county has leveled land and built ridges and furrows on 150,000 mu; raised roadbeds for 218 kilometers; constructed 4 water storage projects with a capacity of 13.4 million cubic meters; and piloted terraced fields with ditches and furrows on 1,850 mu. These projects have played a certain role in reducing drought, flood, and sandstorm disasters and ensuring increased agricultural production. The wheat planting area in the county has expanded from 540,000 mu in 1949 to 690,000 mu in 1955, and the yield has increased from 54 jin per mu to 371 jin per mu. Comparing the rainfall from July to early September in previous years with the inundated area of ​​autumn crops also shows the effect of soil and water conservation: in 1951, rainfall was 105 mm, inundating 320,000 mu; in 1953, rainfall was 226 mm, inundating only 130,000 mu; in 1954, rainfall was 459 mm, with a total rainfall duration of 98 hours, inundating 590,000 mu; in 1955, rainfall was similar to 1954, but due to the comprehensive implementation of soil and water conservation work, only 360,000 mu were inundated. In Dicheng Township, 6,000 mu of land were inundated in 1951 when ridges were not made, but after ridges were built, only 200 mu were inundated in 1953, reducing inundation by 5,800 mu and increasing production by 65 jin per mu. In the Louguidui saline-alkali area, the average yield was 31 jin per mu before terraced fields with ditches and furrows were built, but increased to 71 jin after they were built.

What experiences have been gained in soil and water conservation work over the past few years?

First, Party and government leaders attach importance to it, establish organizational structures, and extensively mobilize the masses to carry out soil and water conservation work. Before the spring plowing in 1952, the county Party committee conducted systematic arrangements on soil and water conservation as the main content at the county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings. At the same time, soil and water conservation headquarters at all levels were established, and special personnel were assigned to be responsible. Relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, policies were publicized, disasters were recalled, accounts were compared, and the benefits of soil and water conservation were promoted. Districts and villages were organized to sign agreements, divide sections, and assign responsibility for specific areas. Regular soil and water conservation meetings were held to summarize experiences, train cadres, and impart technology. This enabled soil and water conservation work to be rapidly carried out throughout the county.

Second, adapting to local conditions, preventing disasters based on their specific nature, making overall plans, and proceeding comprehensively are effective ways to gradually eliminate drought, flood, and sandstorm disasters. Since liberation, although certain achievements have been made in tree planting and afforestation, water conservancy construction, and soil and water conservation, the effects were not significant because there was no unified planning and scientific design at the beginning, and unreasonable old habits of the masses were accommodated. It was not until 1954 that unified planning was made and soil and water conservation work was comprehensively carried out through learning from advanced Soviet experience and conducting investigations and research.

Beginning in 1954, in the county's 460,000 mu of sandy soil wind erosion area, in accordance with the spirit of "preventing wind and fixing sand, conserving soil and water" and "taking care of mechanized farming and reducing water disasters," agricultural field protection forest construction was carried out, and ridges were generally made on the cultivated land within the protection forest grid. At the same time, various forms of living sand barriers and planting pastures were used to fix all sand ridges.

At the same time, in the 560,000 mu of sandy loam soil, in conjunction with the construction of well and spring channels, land was vigorously leveled, ridges were made, and ditches were closed and soil was cultivated to ensure that "every piece of land has ridges" and horizontal plowing, horizontal sowing, and horizontal hoeing were implemented. It is guaranteed that soil erosion will be basically avoided in the event of continuous rainfall of 120 mm within three days.

In the 290,000 mu of low-lying saline-alkali land, soil improvement forests and a mass movement of terraced fields with ditches and furrows were generally carried out to lower the groundwater level and improve the soil.

In addition, sand depressions and bad lands are used to store floodwater, and drainage channels are repaired to prevent flooding.

In order to fundamentally change the natural appearance of the county and ensure increased agricultural production year after year, Yuanyang County plans to basically eliminate ordinary drought, flood, and sandstorm disasters by 1962. The plan requires that in the 910,000 mu of sandy loam and sandy land suitable for irrigation development, one well should be dug for every 60 mu, for a total of 15,200 wells, with 8,900 wells to be completed in 1956 and 6,300 wells to be completed in 1957. In addition to ensuring a harvest on 20 mu per well, each well can also resist drought and protect seeds and seedlings on 40 mu. By 1957, 410,000 mu of land can be guaranteed a harvest, and 610,000 mu of land can be protected from drought and seeds and seedlings, averaging 3 mu of guaranteed harvest land and drought-resistant seed and seedling protection land per person, so as to eliminate general drought disasters. The plan also requires that ordinary flood disasters be basically eliminated in 1956, the terraced field project with ditches and furrows on 290,000 mu of saline-alkali land be completed by 1962, and sandstorm disasters be basically eliminated. Coupled with other agricultural measures, by 1962, the county's grain sown area will increase from 1.78 million mu in 1955 to 2.41 million mu, the yield per mu will increase from 89 jin to 450 jin, and the grain per person will increase from 480 jin to 3,387 jin; the cotton sown area will increase from 130,000 mu to 150,000 mu, and the yield per mu will increase from 24 jin of lint cotton to 105 jin; the oil crop sown area will increase from 60,000 mu to 110,000 mu, and the yield per mu will increase from 100 jin to 380 jin. This will greatly improve the living standards of the people throughout the county.

    争取在七年内消除旱、涝、风沙灾害
    河南省原阳县农业科长　邓全伦
    河南省原阳县共有耕地面积131万亩，其中沙壤土地56万亩，占总耕地的43％；沙土地46万亩，占总耕地的35％；盐碱土地29万亩，占总耕地的22％。这个县冬春多风，夏旱秋涝，因而旱、涝、风沙灾害极为严重。据调查：一次6到7级的风，24小时内，在46万亩的沙土地面上，被风吹去的肥沃土壤约有750万公方。1951到1955年间，全县有四年受涝灾，二年受风灾，一年受旱灾，一年受霜灾。1952年全年降雨仅140公厘，全县120多万亩秋田普遍受旱。1954年7月和8月，降雨459公厘，淹秋田59万亩，占秋田面积的52％。由于自然灾害严重，土壤破坏，产量极低。1949年粮食作物平均单位面积产量仅77斤。1955年平均单位面积产量也只达到89斤。
    随着农业互助合作运动的发展，全县从1952年起，开展了群众性的植树造林、兴修水利和水土保持运动。四年来共造林25，558亩，其中有农田防护林带110道，植树343万株，预计林带长成后，可保护农田47万亩。全县整地打畦、墒沟变墒岗等15万亩；抬高路基218公里；兴修蓄水工程4处，能蓄水1，340万公方；试办沟洫台田1，850亩。这些工程对减轻旱、涝、风沙灾害，保障农业增产，起了一定的作用。全县小麦种植面积由1949年的54万亩，扩大到1955年的69万亩，产量由每亩54斤提高到371斤。拿历年7月到9月初旬降雨量同秋庄稼被淹面积比较，也看出了水土保持的作用：1951年降雨105公厘，淹地32万亩；1953年降雨226公厘，只淹地13万亩；1954年降雨459公厘，总共降雨历时98小时，淹59万亩；1955年降雨和1954年相近，由于全面地开展了水土保持工作，只淹地36万亩。地城乡1951年没有做畦田，淹地6，000亩，修做畦田后，1953年只淹200亩，减淹5，800亩，每亩增产65斤。娄谷堆盐碱地区，没有做沟洫台田前每亩平均收31斤，做了沟洫台田便提高到71斤。
    几年来在水土保持工作中取得那些经验呢？
    一、党政领导重视，建立组织机构，普遍发动群众，开展水土保持工作。1952年春耕前，县委以水土保持为主要内容，在县、区、乡三级干部会议上进行了系统布置。同时组成各级水土保持指挥部，确定专人负责。依靠互助合作组织，宣传政策，回忆灾害，对比算账，宣传水土保持的好处。组织区同区、村同村订立协议，划分地段，分片包干。定期召开水土保持会议，总结经验，训练干部，传授技术。这样就使水土保持工作，在全县范围内迅速开展起来。
    二、因地制宜，因害设防，通盘规划，全面进行，是逐步消灭旱、涝、风沙灾害的有效办法。解放以来，虽然在植树造林、兴修水利、水土保持方面，取得了一定的成绩，但是由于开始没有统一规划和科学设计，迁就群众不合理的旧习惯，效果不大，直到1954年通过学习苏联先进经验和调查研究，才做了统一规划，全面开展了水土保持工作。
    1954年开始在全县46万亩的沙土风蚀地内，本着“防风固沙、保持水土”和“照顾机耕、减少水患”的精神，开展了营造农田防护林工作，在防护林网格内的耕地上普遍做了畦田。同时采用各种形式的活沙障和种植牧草等方法，把所有沙岗全部固定下来。
    同时，在56万亩的沙壤土地内，结合井泉渠道建设，大力平整土地，扒格打畦，封沟培土，做到“地地有畦埂”，实行横耕、横播、横锄。保证在三天内连续降雨120公厘的情况下，基本上避免水土流失。
    在29万亩低洼盐碱地内，普遍开展营造土壤改良林和群众性的沟洫台田运动，以降低地下水位，改良土壤。
    此外，还利用沙洼坏地，滞洪蓄水，整修排水渠道，防止涝灾。
    为了从根本上改变全县的自然面貌，保证农业年年增产，原阳县计划在1962年内基本上消除普通的旱、涝、风沙灾害。计划要求在适宜发展灌溉的91万亩沙壤沙土地带，做到每60亩打井一眼，共打井15，200眼，1956年完成8，900眼，1957年完成6，300眼。每眼井除保收20亩外，还可抗旱保种、保苗40亩。到1957年可达到保收地41万亩，抗旱保种、保苗地61万亩，平均每人合保收地及抗旱保种、保苗地3亩，做到消灭一般旱灾。计划同时要求在1956年内基本上消灭普通涝灾，在1962年内完成29万亩盐碱地的沟洫台田工程和基本上消除风沙灾害。加上其他农业措施，到1962年全县粮食播种面积由1955年的178万亩增至241万亩，每亩产量由89斤提高到450斤，每人合粮由480斤提高到3，387斤；棉花播种面积由13万亩增至15万亩，每亩产量由皮棉24斤提高到105斤；油料播种面积由6万亩增至11万亩，每亩产量由100斤提高至380斤。这样就可以大大提高全县人民的生活水平。
