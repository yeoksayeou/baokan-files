Shanghai industrial enterprises showed new characteristics in production during the first month of this year.

In the metal smelting sector, the No. 143 copper smelting open-hearth furnace at the Shanghai Smelting Plant set 11 new records for rapid copper smelting in January. Copper that used to take a day and a half to produce now only takes one day. The steelmaking workers at the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant's converter broke the state plan of smelting 137 furnaces of steel per day, averaging nearly 4 more furnaces per day, and set new records of smelting 147, 151, and 153 furnaces per day. In January, the five major steel plants smelted more than 5,000 tons of steel and rolled more than 6,000 tons of steel products than in the same period last year. Steel rolling factories throughout the city also rushed to produce more than 12,000 tons of agricultural tool steel.

The new high-speed cutting record for Shanghai's machinery workers this month is 769 meters per minute. This was created by Chen Genrong, a lathe operator at the Xinzhong Power Machinery Plant. Previously, Fu Mingkun, a lathe operator at the Xinzhong Power Machinery Plant, had broken the 550-meter record of Sheng Li, a lathe operator at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, with a cutting speed of 582 meters per minute. Subsequently, Li Jinbiao, a lathe operator at the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, surpassed Fu Mingkun with a record of 667 meters. Now, Sheng Li is modifying his lathe to prepare to create a record of 1,000 meters.

In January, more than 50 cotton textile factories produced more than 2,600 more bales of cotton yarn and more than 1.04 million meters of cotton cloth than planned.

In the first month of participating in the national inter-factory competition among machine tool manufacturers, the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan for January. Four indicators, including total output value, commodity output value, main product output, and labor productivity, all reached the 1957 level. The plant's guarantee, put forward at the beginning of January when it joined the inter-factory competition—to reach the 1957 production level 20 months ahead of schedule in April this year—has now been achieved 3 months ahead of schedule.

    上海工业生产不断出现新纪录
    上海机床厂出色地完成一月份计划
    今年第一个月，上海工业企业生产中出现了新气象。
    在金属冶炼部门中，上海冶炼厂第143号炼铜平炉1月份出现了11次快速炼铜的新纪录。去年要花一天半时间生产的铜，现在只要一天就行了。上海第一钢厂转炉炼钢工人突破了每天炼137炉钢的国家计划，平均每天多炼近4炉钢，并且创造了日炼147炉、151炉、153炉的新纪录。5个主要钢厂1月份比去年同期多炼了5，000多吨钢，多轧了6，000多吨钢材。全市轧钢工厂还突击生产出12，000多吨农具钢材。
    这个月上海机械工人高速切削的新纪录是每分钟769公尺。这是新中动力机厂车工陈根荣创造的。在此以前，新中动力机厂车工傅明坤曾以每分钟切削582公尺打破了上海机床厂车工盛利的550公尺纪录。接着，上海机床厂车工李锦标又以667公尺的纪录超过了傅明坤。现在，盛利正在改装车床准备创造1，000公尺的纪录。
    50几个棉纺织厂1月份比计划多生产了2，600多件棉纱和104万多公尺棉布。
    国营上海机床厂参加全国机床制造厂厂际竞赛的第一个月，全面超额完成了1月份的国家计划。生产总值、商品产值、主要产品产量和劳动生产率等4项指标，都达到了1957年的水平。这个厂在1月初参加厂际竞赛的时候提出的保证：在今年4月份提前20个月达到1957年的生产水平，现在已经提前3个月实现了。　　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
