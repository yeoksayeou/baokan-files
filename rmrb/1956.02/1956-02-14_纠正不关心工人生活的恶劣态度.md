Correct the Bad Attitude of Not Caring About Workers' Lives
To the Editor:

　　The working conditions at the Jiangxi Pesticide Factory are very poor. In the powder workshop, dust often fills the air, making it impossible to see things more than a meter away, and the 60-watt light bulbs are as dim as stars in the sky. In this workshop, workers Pan Qingshan, Xiong Jinfeng, Jiang Heigou, and 8 others fainted one after another. Recently, workers underwent a physical examination, and a significant proportion were found to have tuberculosis or stomach ailments.

　　The problem is so serious, but the factory director is indifferent to the safety and health of the workers, adopting a bad attitude of concealing the truth from superiors and oppressing subordinates. Workers who fainted were made to resume production less than two hours after regaining consciousness; two workers who fainted more frequently were simply dismissed. This year, the responsible comrades from Jiangxi Province were scheduled to inspect the factory. Factory Director Yang Wenxue quickly issued orders to stop several of the powder machines and mixers that produced the most dust, leaving only two machines with the least dust to continue production. Later, the labor bureau and trade union units of Jiangxi Province and Nanchang City, following the instructions of the provincial responsible comrades, inspected the dust-filled problem in the factory workshop and proposed suggestions for sealing the machines to reduce dust. Now, the dust in the workshop has been significantly reduced. However, some leading staff members of the factory are ideologically resistant, believing that the trade union is simply engaging in "welfare."

　　This factory implements labor insurance. According to regulations, 50% of the ordinary medical expenses for workers' family members are to be borne by the public funds. However, the factory does not follow the regulations and still charges employees' family members the full amount of ordinary medical expenses. The workers are dissatisfied and say: The Party and the government care about us and issued the labor insurance regulations. Why doesn't the Jiangxi Pesticide Factory implement the provisions of the regulations?

　　The factory's enterprise bonus fund has only used 200 yuan from the establishment of the factory until last year, and only after repeated urging by higher-level leading organs; the remaining 15,418 yuan is still being held up to this day. However, the lives of individual workers in this factory are very difficult. The factory director turns a deaf ear to this and only cares about taking the bonus fund to subsidize himself. Based on the factory's completion of the state plan and continuous improvement of labor productivity, the higher-level leading organs, in accordance with the national wage growth rate, formulated an employee wage plan, with an increase of 2.5% in 1954 and 3.5% in 1955. However, the factory only implemented this plan in terms of the wages of administrative staff, and did not adjust or increase the wages of workers. The trade union staff in the province and city pointed out that it was wrong for the factory to do so. However, the leading staff of the factory believe that the trade union is engaging in "economism."

　　Indeed, economism should be opposed, but we must never allow bureaucrats to use it as a "shield" to refuse criticism and correct mistakes.

### 纠正不关心工人生活的恶劣态度

    纠正不关心工人生活的恶劣态度编辑同志：
    江西农药厂工人的劳动条件是非常恶劣的。像粉剂车间经常粉尘弥漫，在一公尺以外的东西人们就看不清，60支光的电灯暗淡得像天上的星星一样。在这个车间里，曾经发生工人潘青山、熊金凤、江黑苟等11人先后晕倒的事故。最近工人进行过一次身体检查，患肺结核病和患胃病的占相当大的比例。
  问题这样严重，但是这个厂的厂长却对工人安全健康漠不关心，而采取了对上掩饰，对下欺压的恶劣态度。晕倒了的工人，苏醒过来后还不到两小时，就让他继续从事生产；其中有两个晕倒次数较多的，甚至干脆被辞退了。今年，江西省负责同志要到这个厂来视察。厂长杨文学就赶紧下命令，把几部粉尘最大的打粉机和混合机停了车，只剩下两部粉尘最少的机器继续生产。以后，江西省和南昌市的劳动局、工会等单位，接受省里负责同志的指示，对这个厂车间里粉尘弥漫的问题作了检查，提出密闭机器减少尘土的建议。现在，车间尘土已经显著地减少了。但是这个厂的一些领导工作人员却思想不通，认为这是工会在单纯地搞“福利”。
    这个厂是实施劳动保险的。按规定，工人家属看病有50％的普通药费是由公家负担的。但是厂方不按条例办事，还是向职工家属要全部的普通药费。工人们不满意地说：党和政府关怀我们，颁发了劳动保险条例。为什么江西农药厂却不执行条例的规定呢？
    这个厂的企业奖励基金从建厂到去年才动用了200元，还是在上级领导机关的一再督促下才用的；其余的15，418元，到现在还积压着。但是这个厂的个别工人生活很困难。厂长对此不闻不问，甚至只顾把奖励基金拿去补助他自己。上级领导机关在这个厂完成国家计划和不断提高劳动生产率的基础上，按照国家的工资增长率，编制了职工工资计划，1954年增长2．5％，1955年增长3．5％。但是这个厂只在行政工作人员的工资方面执行了这个计划，对工人的工资却不予调整和增长。省和市的工会工作人员指出这个厂这样做是错误的。而工厂的领导工作人员却认为这是工会在搞“经济主义”。
    不错，经济主义是应该反对的，但是我们决不容许官僚主义者拿它作为“挡箭牌”，来拒绝批评、改正错误。
