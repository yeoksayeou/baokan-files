Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 7th (via TASS) – The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session in Paris on February 7th. General Secretary Maurice Thorez attended the meeting.

The Secretary of the French Communist Party, Laurent Casanova, delivered a report on strengthening the Party. Casanova emphasized that this issue is inextricably linked to the struggles of the working people to satisfy their demands, of the French people to implement social progress policies, to resolve the Algerian question through negotiations, and to strive for peace and disarmament, as well as to establish a European collective security system and ease international tensions. The desire of the working people for united action has been strengthened in these struggles, and the movement advocating the establishment of a Popular Front has expanded.

Casanova then pointed out that a large number of new members have joined the ranks of the French Communist Party recently. In the first few days of February alone, 82 local organizations of the Party recruited 20,900 new members. Casanova finally called on all Party members to further strengthen Party organizations in factories and rural areas.

After discussing Casanova's report, the Central Committee unanimously adopted a resolution calling on Party organizations at all levels and all Party members to redouble their efforts and achieve new successes in expanding the Party's ranks and establishing new Party organizations on this basis.

The plenary session also adopted a resolution on the current situation in Algeria. The resolution stated that a group of fascist bandits organized riots in Algeria and attempted to impose their will on the French government.

The Central Committee pointed out that this situation contains serious dangers. It pointed out that the only correct way to resolve the Algerian question is to hold ceasefire negotiations on the basis of recognizing the national rights of the Algerian people and to immediately stop the bloodshed.

The Central Committee plenary session called on Party organizations at all levels and all Party members to continue their efforts to strive for the establishment of a united front between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, as a necessary condition for uniting national democratic forces and ensuring the implementation of the changes desired by the nation.

The plenary session decided to convene the French Communist Party Congress in Le Havre from July 18th to 21st this year. The agenda of the Congress includes three issues: striving for social progress, for peace, and for the dignity of the French nation (reporter Maurice Thorez); the municipal council serves the broad working people (reporter Jacques Duclos); and the election of the Party's leading organs.

    法国共产党中央委员会举行全体会议
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎7日讯　法国共产党中央委员会7日在巴黎举行全体会议。总书记多列士出席了会议。
    法国共产党中央委员会书记赛尔文在会上做了关于加强党的问题的报告。赛尔文着重指出，这个问题是同劳动人民争取满足他们的要求、法国人民争取实行社会进步政策、争取以谈判解决阿尔及利亚问题、争取和平和裁军以及建立欧洲集体安全体系和和缓国际紧张局势的斗争密切不可分的。劳动人民要求一致行动的愿望，在这些斗争中加强了，主张建立人民阵线的运动扩大了。
    赛尔文接着指出，最近时期，有大批新党员加入了法国共产党的队伍。仅仅在2月份的最初几天中，党的82个地方组织就吸收了20，900个新党员。赛尔文最后要求全体党员进一步加强工厂和农村中的党组织。
    在讨论赛尔文的报告之后，中央委员会一致通过决议，号召党的各级组织和全体党员加倍努力，在扩大党的队伍和在这种基础上建立新的党组织方面取得新的成就。
    全会还通过了关于阿尔及利亚当前局势的决议。决议说，一批法西斯匪徒在阿尔及利亚组织骚乱，并且企图把他们的意志强加在法国政府身上。
    中央委员会指出，这种情况包含着严重的危险性。它指出，解决阿尔及利亚问题的唯一正确的方法是，在承认阿尔及利亚人民的民族权利的基础上举行停火谈判，立即停止流血。
    中央委员会全体会议号召各级党组织和全体党员继续努力争取建立共产党和社会党的统一战线，作为团结全国民主力量和保证实施全国所希望的改变的必要条件。
    全体会议决定今年7月18日到21日在哈佛尔召开法国共产党代表大会。大会议程包括3个问题：争取社会进步，争取和平和法国国家的尊严（报告人莫里斯·多列士）；市议会为广大劳动人民服务（报告人雅克·杜克洛）；选举党的领导机构。
