The letter also calls for cooperation between the German Trade Union Federation and the Free German Trade Union Federation.

The letter was signed by: Eberth, Mayor of Greater Berlin; Mückenberger, Member of the People's Chamber; Alte, Chairman of the Association for Foreign Cultural Relations; and Buchwitz, Member of the People's Chamber and veteran of the German workers' movement.

The letter points out that the serious situation in West Germany particularly requires the working class—Social Democrats, Communists, and non-party workers—to unite and form a combat alliance of the working class, and to formulate a unified and clear program.

The letter states: Such a path is the path to a peaceful and democratically unified Germany.
