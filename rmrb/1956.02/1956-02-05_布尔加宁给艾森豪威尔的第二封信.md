Eisenhower's Reply

Moscow
His Excellency Nikolai A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I wish to thank you for your letter of January 23rd, which was delivered to me through Ambassador Zarubin. I have carefully considered it.

Let me state at the outset that I do indeed believe that the current international situation requires all countries, particularly the great powers, to seek to ease international tensions and strengthen international trust and cooperation.

With the growth of destructive power, it is now imperative not only to seek to control and limit that power, but also to eliminate the animosity that might tempt people to use it. I can assure you that this is the view held without exception by the American people and their political leaders.

I believe that this is also the view of the peoples of all countries, and I believe that those entrusted with political power have a noble responsibility to satisfy the universal desire of the peoples for peace.

You will recall that I have pointed out more than once the very valuable asset we possess—the historic friendship between our two peoples. I deeply believe that on this foundation, better political relations can be built. I can assure you, Mr. Chairman, that there is no nation in the world more sincerely committed to establishing peace than the American people. Our entire nation yearns to end the tension and danger that exist in the current international situation. Indeed, there is no honorable thing we are unwilling to do if we believe it will promote a just peace in the world.

It is from this point of view that I have studied your proposal that a 20-year treaty of friendship and cooperation between our two countries would help the cause of peace.

I believe, first of all, that our two countries are already linked together in a solemn treaty—the Charter of the United Nations. The treaty you now propose would include three substantive provisions. I also believe that each of these provisions is already included in the explicit terms of this United Nations treaty between us.

The first article of your draft would obligate our two countries to develop friendly relations between our two peoples on the basis of equality of rights, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs. As member states of the United Nations, we have already undertaken under this organization the obligation to "develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples."

The second article of the treaty you propose would obligate us to resolve our international disputes only by peaceful means. Our two countries have already undertaken this obligation under Article 2, paragraph 3 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that "All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means."

The third article would obligate us to strengthen economic, cultural, and scientific cooperation. Chapter IX of the United Nations Charter on "International Economic and Social Co-operation" has already assured us that we must strive for the "solution of international economic, social, health, and related problems" and for "international cultural and educational co-operation."

The United Nations Charter is not only a solemn treaty between you and me—it is also a treaty between the many nations that are linked together with us and with each other and all concerned with world peace. The American people sincerely hope to work together to achieve these goals of the Charter.

But the words on the Charter have not prevented the current international tensions. How can we hope that merely repeating these words in a bilateral form can correct the current situation?

I do not know whether another treaty-drafting process, this time on a bilateral basis only, would actually be detrimental to the cause of peace by creating an illusion that the result can be achieved by waving a pen, when in fact it can only be achieved through a change of spirit.

Friendly cooperation between countries does not depend entirely on treaty guarantees, but on the spirit that inspires the governments concerned and on practical actions.

It was with the hope of promoting this spirit and this action that I went to Geneva last July, an event unprecedented in America's peacetime history. Although many doubted whether the trip would actually do any good, I thought at the time that the situation was so serious that any chance of improvement, however small, should not be missed. You expressed the same views and wishes in Geneva.

I sincerely hoped at the time that the meeting with you and the heads of government of France and the United Kingdom would lead to an improvement in international relations, especially between the four countries participating in the meeting and on the specific issues for which our four countries had specific responsibilities.

Unfortunately, the American people have sadly concluded that the events that have occurred since our meeting have not fulfilled their hopes.

Allow me to recount a brief record of recent events.

In Geneva, we instructed our foreign ministers to propose effective ways to resolve three specific issues.

The first of these issues was European security and the German question. We had clearly agreed that the resolution of the German question and the reunification of Germany through free elections should be carried out in accordance with the German people's national interests and the interests of European security. However, despite the numerous constructive suggestions made by the three Western powers for German reunification and European security, your government felt unable at this time to accept any suggestion for German reunification through free elections.

The second issue was disarmament. When we discussed this issue in Geneva, I put forward the "Open Skies" proposal in the hope that we might really do something to convince the world that we had no aggressive intentions towards each other. But your government rejected this proposal at the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

The third issue was the development of East-West contacts. The Western ministers put forward many concrete proposals that could promote closer relations and better understanding, but your government accepted none of them. Despite this fact, as Your Excellency pointed out, there has been some increase in contacts between the Soviet Union and the United States of America recently.

Further deterioration has occurred because, in our view, your government has seemed to be pursuing a policy in various parts of the world of exacerbating tensions by deepening hatred and animosity inherent in historic international disputes. I, like you, believe that an improvement in Soviet-American relations is urgently needed. But frankly, our people find it difficult to reconcile what appears to be the objective of your government in these areas with your words today, which very rightly emphasize the special responsibility of our two governments to ease international tensions and strengthen international trust and cooperation.

I have discussed the history of the past year solely so that we may be more likely to successfully plan our future. Our country extends a hand of friendship to all who are willing to genuinely accept it. I have often said before, and I repeat again, that there is nothing I am unwilling to do to promote a just peace throughout the world. But we know that what matters is action, not just words.

Think, Mr. Chairman, what a great change would occur not only in our relations but throughout the world if swift action were taken to reunify Germany under freedom within secure boundaries; if our wartime guarantee to respect the right of each people to choose the form of government that will govern them were fulfilled; if arrangements were made for mutual inspection of our two countries in order to eliminate the possibility of surprise attack; if disarmament became practically feasible so as to liberate productive forces to improve human life. Think, too, of how the mountains of distrust and misunderstanding would disappear if our two peoples freely exchanged news, information, visits, and ideas.

These are all issues that you and I discussed together in Geneva. They are goals to which our country remains dedicated, and we are prepared to move towards these goals at any time in a spirit of reconciliation. May I hope, on the basis of your letter, that you too are committed to these great goals?

I look forward to receiving your further expression of views.

Sincerely,
Dwight D. Eisenhower

Bulganin's Second Letter

To U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower

Your Excellency
Washington

Dear Mr. President:

The cordial tone of your letter of January 27 reminds me of the sincere and frank talks I had with you and our colleagues in Geneva six months ago. There may be different positions, there may be different points of view, but as long as there is sincerity and a desire for mutual understanding, such discussions will help to strengthen trust and foster friendly relations.

I am pleased that you agree that the current international situation requires all countries, especially the major powers that have a special responsibility for ensuring peace and the security of all peoples, to take measures that will further ease international tensions and strengthen international trust and cooperation.

I am also satisfied that you agree that the historical friendship between our two peoples provides us with a foundation on which good political relations between our two countries can be built.

It is precisely because we have such a foundation that my colleagues and I decided to propose to you, immediately after our people celebrated the New Year, that we jointly consider concrete measures that could greatly improve relations between our two countries. In doing so, we take into account that the fate of world peace depends to a great extent on the nature of relations between our two countries. We believe that the time has come for our two countries to conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation. The conclusion of such a treaty would be a major contribution to the development of Soviet-American relations and would also help to improve relations between your friends and our friends on the international stage. We can only express our regret that our proposal was not met with your approval.

As I understand it, what confuses you is that the draft treaty we have proposed repeats to some extent certain provisions of the United Nations Charter, which our two countries have signed. However, we believe that this not only does not hinder, but on the contrary, would promote the conclusion of the treaty. The existence of the United Nations Charter in no way precludes the possibility of member states of that organization from concluding bilateral agreements based on the principles of the Charter. The United Nations Charter clearly states that Members should "establish appropriate conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained."

The United States, like many other countries, has concluded many bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements since the establishment of the United Nations. And the undeniable right of sovereign states to conclude any treaties and agreements that adjust their relations with other countries for the sake of peace has never been questioned, nor will it be questioned.

Another point that must be considered is that the United Nations Charter itself will not be fully effective if relations between the two largest countries in the world, the Soviet Union and the United States, are not good. Only when our two countries cooperate and work together to achieve the purposes of the United Nations will the United Nations Charter be more effective. I think you will agree with this point.

As I understand it, what causes you some doubt is that since the United Nations Charter is a "treaty between many countries," why do we suggest that you conclude a "bilateral" treaty?

However, you will surely agree that the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two strongest countries in the world would greatly improve the international situation. On the other hand, we agree to conclude similar treaties with other countries, including Britain and France. Finally, the proposal to conclude a treaty between the two groups of countries, the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty, remains valid.

In your letter, you rightly point out that in order to establish world peace, it is important to have action, not just words. The conclusion of a Soviet-American treaty of friendship and cooperation would be one of the most important concrete actions in this regard, because if our two countries undertake the most important obligations stipulated in the draft treaty, this would strengthen trust and help to ease the entire international tension. This would show that our two countries are not limited to making verbal assurances of hope for friendship, but are beginning to implement our obligations in practice.

Incidentally, it can be pointed out that after the Geneva Conference, some important measures have already been taken to help ease international tensions, and therefore it is difficult to agree with the statement that the period after the Geneva Conference has disappointed the hopes of the peoples of all countries.

The Soviet government has implemented a number of measures aimed at easing international tensions and strengthening trust between countries. In this regard, I would like to mention the following points: In 1955, the Soviet Union reduced its armed forces by 640,000 men, the Soviet Union's military expenditure in 1956 was reduced by 9.6 billion rubles compared with 1955, the Soviet Union gave up the last military base on the territory of other countries, namely the Porkkala Peninsula military base in Finland, and the Soviet Union initiated the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, as a result of which all foreign troops withdrew from Austria and Austria undertook to pursue a policy of permanent neutrality.

Other efforts made by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions and improve relations between countries are also well known.

The Soviets believe that other countries can also confirm their words with practical actions. But, Mr. President, if I may speak frankly, it should be said that some major powers have not only failed to take similar action, but have instead spent a great deal of effort in exacerbating international tensions.

Although our meeting in Geneva produced some positive results, the military appropriations of some Western countries, including the United States, have not been reduced, but have increased. The United States has also increased its military bases in other countries, and these bases are mainly built in areas bordering the Soviet Union. You will agree that this cannot but cause the Soviet people to have understandable concerns about the intentions of the United States.

It cannot but be noted that some American leaders, disregarding the mutual guarantees of peace made between you and me, Mr. President, at the Geneva Conference, continue to make remarks that cannot be said to be in line with the "spirit of Geneva." Everyone knows, for example, that just recently, someone in the United States made remarks advocating a policy of keeping the country on the "brink of war." It cannot but be noted the warlike remarks of some military leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, who openly call for continued expansion of armaments and for the stockpiling of atomic weapons in the armies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and who do not hesitate to threaten to use atomic weapons.

Our proposal that our two countries conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation is based on the premise that the conclusion of this treaty and the improvement of relations between our two countries will help to achieve a large-scale reduction of armaments and armed forces. For example, everyone can reduce the armed forces of the five countries to the level that the United States and the Soviet Union have both agreed to. Reaching an agreement on the issue of atomic weapons, which the peoples of all countries are demanding to be banned, would also help this. The issue of establishing corresponding international supervision would then be easily resolved.

In your letter, you again drew attention to your proposal on "Open Skies," which calls for U.S. and Soviet aircraft to fly over the territory of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to conduct aerial photography, and to exchange military intelligence. My colleagues and I have already had the opportunity to express our attitude on this proposal. We believe that in the current international situation, especially under the conditions of unrestricted expansion of armaments, conducting such flights will not only fail to eliminate the fear of a new war among the peoples of all countries, but will instead deepen this fear and mutual suspicion. Mr. President, please judge for yourself: if your country's military leaders receive a report saying that aerial photography proves that your neighbors have more airports, what will they do? They will definitely order the immediate construction of more airports. Our military leaders would of course do the same in a similar situation. It is not difficult to understand that the result will be a further intensification of the expansion of armaments.

The situation will be different if we reach an agreement on the reduction of armaments and armed forces. At that time, conducting corresponding supervision (the methods of supervision can be agreed upon) will be correct and necessary.

It cannot but be seen that if the Soviet Union and the United States guarantee to resolve all disputes between the two countries only by peaceful means, that is, to renounce the use of force or the threat of force in relations between the two countries—including atomic and hydrogen weapons—, this will truly calm the international situation and will create more favorable conditions for reaching agreements on other outstanding international issues.

Therefore, the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union would mean, as you say in your letter, that we can take some practical actions "to convince the world that we have no aggressive intentions towards each other."

As for the specific international issues involved in your letter, I still believe that, apart from the issue of disarmament, the most important issue is the issue of ensuring European security. The Soviet government put forward some concrete proposals for resolving this issue at the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference in the autumn of 1955. The Soviet government, as before, believes that the most appropriate way to effectively ensure European security is to establish a unified, pan-European collective security system.

Our proposals also take into account the wishes of the three Western powers on many major issues, and also take into account the specific proposals made by the representatives of the Western countries on this aspect during the Geneva Conference. The Soviet government's proposals on ensuring European security also fully take into account the important role played by the United States in resolving European affairs.

However, the three governments did not agree with our proposals, and in response to our proposals, they put forward a plan that would re-implement militarization throughout Germany, while stipulating that the unified Germany should join the exclusive military group established by the Western countries.

It is not difficult to understand that such a plan cannot serve as the basis for resolving the issue of ensuring true security in Europe and resolving the German issue.

Since two Germanys have emerged in Europe after the war and they have been consolidated, they have different social and economic systems and are developing along different paths, then, it goes without saying that the issue of building Germany into a peaceful, democratic, and unified country cannot be resolved unless the Germans themselves, that is, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, have reached a corresponding agreement.

At the same time, I believe that the normalization of Soviet-American relations, especially the step of concluding a Soviet-American treaty of friendship and cooperation, also has a major positive significance in providing the necessary prerequisites for resolving the German issue.

As for the opinion you mentioned that the peoples of all countries have the right to choose the form of government according to their wishes, it must be pointed out that the Soviet Union has always consistently followed such a principle: the domestic system of any country is the internal affair of the people of that country. We hope that other countries will also follow this principle in their international relations.

In your letter, you also talked about the important issue of developing contacts between East and West. We fully agree with your view on the significance of such contacts. It is precisely because of this that the Soviet Union proposed at the Foreign Ministers Conference held last autumn to eliminate the obstacles hindering the development of normal trade and economic relations, and to expand contacts in culture, science, art, sports, and tourism. We are all satisfied that the Geneva Conference once had some consensus on this issue. However, the delegations of the United States and other Western countries ultimately put forward some demands that violated the instructions that I, you, Mr. Eden, and Mr. Faure gave to our foreign ministers. The Soviet government cannot accept these new demands because they mean direct interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states.

Unfortunately, even the practical measures taken by the Soviet government to develop contacts between our countries, including the exchange of delegations, have been severely obstructed by the United States.

I believe that we can use our joint efforts to eliminate the so-called "Iron Curtain" and create conditions for the extensive development of direct contact between citizens of our countries. I hope that you will agree with this opinion.

There is no doubt that the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between our two countries will also have a major positive significance on this issue.

These are the views that I would like to express to you, Mr. President, regarding the opinions raised in your letter. I very much hope that these opinions will help to explain why my colleagues and I attach importance to the conclusion of a Soviet-American treaty of friendship and cooperation.

We on our side are willing to study very carefully any opinions that you believe must be put forward on certain provisions of the draft treaty. I await your further expression of opinion on this issue.

Sincerely,
N. Bulganin

    布尔加宁给艾森豪威尔的第二封信
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日电：大家知道，1月25日苏联驻美国特命全权大使格·纳·查鲁宾拜会了美利坚合众国总统德怀特·戴·艾森豪威尔，并且向他递交了苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁1月23日的信。苏联报纸曾经发表过这封信的全文。
    2月2日格·纳·查鲁宾大使拜会了美国国务卿约翰·福·杜勒斯，并且将苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁致美国总统德怀特·戴·艾森豪威尔的又一封信交给他，这封信是在美国总统答复尼·亚·布尔加宁1月23日的信以后写的。美国总统对尼·亚·布尔加宁1月23日信的复信和2月1日尼·亚·布尔加宁再致美国总统的信公布如下：
    艾森豪威尔的复信
    莫斯科
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席尼古拉·亚·布尔加宁阁下：
    亲爱的主席先生：
    我愿感谢你通过查鲁宾大使交给我的1月23日的信件。我已经仔细地考虑过它。
    让我在一开头就说明，我的确认为，目前的国际局势需要各国、特别是大国来设法缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际信任和合作。
    随着摧毁力量的增长，现在必须做的事情不仅是设法控制和限制那种力量，而且要消除可能诱使人们使用那种力量的敌意。我可以向你保证，这是美国人民以及他们的政治领袖毫无例外地抱有的看法。
    我相信，这也是世界各国人民的看法，并且相信被委以政治权力的人们负有崇高的责任来满足各国人民对和平的普遍渴望。
    你一定记得，我曾经不止一次地指出我们拥有的非常可贵的财产——我们两国人民的历史性友谊。我深深相信，在这个基础上，可以建立起更好的政治关系。我可以向你保证，主席先生，全世界没有哪一个国家人民比美国人民更真心诚意地致力于建立和平了。我们全国都渴望停止目前国际局势中出现的紧张和危险。的确没有一件光荣的事情是我们不愿意做的，如果我们相信它会促进世界上正义的和平的话。
    正是从这一观点出发，我研究了你这次提出的意见：如果我们两国现在缔结一项为期20年的友好合作条约，就可以有助于和平事业。
    我首先认为，我们两国已经在一项庄严的条约——联合国宪章——中互相连结起来。你现在建议的那个条约将包括三个实质的条文。我也认为，这些条文的每一条都已经包括在我们之间的这个联合国条约的明确的条款中了。
    你的草案中的第一条将使我们两国承担义务在权利平等、互相尊重和互不干涉内政的基础上发展我们两国人民之间的友好关系。作为联合国的成员国，我们已经在这个组织下承担义务“发展国际间以尊重人民平等权利及自决原则为根据之友好关系”。
    你所建议的条约的第二条将使我们承担义务只采用和平方法来解决我们的国际争端。我们两国已经根据联合国宪章第二条第三项的规定承担了这一项义务，那项条款规定“各会员国应以和平方法解决其国际争端”。
    第三条将使我们承担义务加强经济、文化和科学的合作。联合国宪章关于“国际经济及社会合作”的第九章已经使我们保证必须为“国际间经济、社会、卫生及有关问题之解决”以及“国际间文化及教育合作”而努力。
    联合国宪章不仅是你我两国之间的庄严的条约——它还是同我们连结一起和彼此连结一起并且全都关心世界和平的许多国家之间的条约。美国人民真诚希望协力实现宪章的这些目标。
    但是宪章上的文字并没有防止目前的国际紧张局势。我们如何能够希望仅仅在一种双边的形式中重复这些文字就可以矫正目前的局势呢？
    我不知道，如果再进行一次拟定条约的过程，而这次仅仅在双边的基础上，是否会因为造成一种错觉，认为挥动一下笔杆就可以得到事实上只有通过精神的改变才能得到的结果，而实际上不利于和平事业。
    国与国之间的友好合作并不完全依靠条约保证，而依靠鼓舞有关国家的政府的精神和依靠实际的行动。
    我正是抱着促进这种精神和这种行动的希望在去年7月到日内瓦去的，这件事在美国和平时期的历史上是没有先例的。尽管有许多人怀疑那次的出行实际上会有什么好处，但是我当时认为，当前的局势是如此严重，以致任何可以得到改善的机会，不论多么微小，都不应当放过。你在日内瓦表示了同样的意见和愿望。
    我当时真诚地希望，同你和法国及联合王国的政府首脑举行的那次会议会导致国际关系的改善，特别是在参加那次会议的四国间和在我们四国负有具体责任的具体问题上。
    遗憾的是美国人民已经伤心地得出这样的结论：在我们的会议以后发生的事件并没有使他们的希望实现。
    请允许我向你追述一下最近的事件的简短纪录。
    在日内瓦，我们指示我们的外交部长们提出有效的办法以解决三个具体问题。
    这些问题中的第一个问题是欧洲安全和德国问题。我们曾经明确地商定，解决德国问题以及通过自由选举使德国重新统一的工作应当在符合德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益的情况下进行。但是，尽管西方三国为德国重新统一和欧洲安全提出了若干建设性建议，贵国政府认为不能在这个时候接受关于通过自由选举使德国重新统一的任何建议。
    第二个问题是裁军问题。当我们在日内瓦讨论这个问题的时候，我提出了“开放天空”的建议，以期我们可能真正做一些事来使世界相信我们彼此之间没有任何侵略意图。但是贵国政府在外长会议上拒绝了这个建议。
    第三个问题是发展东西方接触问题。西方国家部长们提出了许多可以促成更密切的关系和更好的谅解的具体建议，但是贵国政府一个都不接受。尽管有这个事实，诚如阁下所指出的，苏联和美利坚合众国之间的接触近来还是有了一些增进。
    已经发生进一步恶化的现象，因为在我们看来，似乎贵国政府曾经在世界各个地区执行这样一种方针，这种方针以加深隐含在历史性国际争执中的憎恨和仇视的办法来加剧紧张局势。我和你一样相信：改善苏美关系是迫切需要的。但是坦率地说，我们的人民觉得很难把似乎是贵国政府在这些地区的目标同你现在的话调和起来，你现在所说的话非常正确地强调了我们两国政府对缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际信任和合作的特别责任。
    我之所以谈过去这一年的历史，完全是为了使我们能够更可能成功地策划我们的未来。我国向一切愿意真诚接受的人伸出友谊之手。我以前常常说，现在再重说一遍，为了促进全世界的公正和平，没有什么事是我不愿意做的。但是我们知道，重要的是行动而不光是言词。
    想想看，主席先生，如果迅速采取措施来在安全的范围内重新统一德国于自由之下；如果履行我们的战时保证，尊重各国人民选择管理他们的政府的形式的权利；如果作出安排使我们两国相互受到视察以便消除突然进攻的可能性；如果裁军成为实际可行从而能够解放生产力来改善人类生活的话，这将不只在我们的关系中而且在整个世界上产生多么大的变化。还请想一想，如果我们两国人民自由地交换新闻、情报、访问和思想的话，不信任和误解的大山就会消失。
    这些全是你和我在日内瓦一起讨论过的问题。它们是我国仍然致力的目标，并且我们准备随时本着和解的精神向这些目标前进。我是否可以根据你的来信希望你也致力于这些伟大目标？
    我期望获得你进一步表示的意见。敬礼
    德怀特·戴·艾森豪威尔
        1956年1月28日于白宫
    布尔加宁的第二封信
    给美国总统德怀特·戴·艾森豪威尔
    阁下
    华盛顿
    尊敬的总统先生：
    你1月27日写来的信是如此的亲切，不禁使我回想到半年前我同你以及我们的同僚在日内瓦进行的诚恳和坦率的谈话。可以有不同的立场，可以有不同的观点，但是，只要同时表现有诚意和互相了解的愿望，那末这种商讨就会有助于加强信任和产生友好关系的。
    使我高兴的是你同意这点意见：目前的国际局势要求各国，首先是要求对保障和平和各国人民的安全负有特殊责任的大国采取能使国际紧张局势进一步缓和、使国际的信任和合作得到加强的措施。
    还使我满意的是你也同意，我们两国人民之间的历史友谊给我们提供了基础，我们两国良好的政治关系可以在这个基础上建立起来。
    正因为有着这样的基础，我和我的同僚们才决定在我国人民庆祝新年之后立刻向您提出共同考虑可以大大改善我们两国关系的具体措施的建议。这里我们考虑到，世界和平的命运在很大程度上取决于我们两国的关系如何。我们认为，我们两国缔结友好合作条约的时机已经来到了。缔结这一条约对发展苏美关系会是一个重大的贡献，同时也会有助于改善国际舞台上你们的朋友和我们的朋友之间的关系。我们的建议没有得到你的赞同，我们对这一点只能表示惋惜。
    据我的理解，你所感到困惑的是，我们所提议的条约草案在某种程度上重复了有我们两国签字的联合国宪章的某些条款。然而，我们认为，这种情况不但不妨碍，而且相反，会促进条约的缔结。联合国宪章的存在决不排斥这个组织的成员国之间缔结以宪章的原则为基础的双边协定的可能性。联合国宪章明白指出，联合国会员国应当“创造适当环境，俾克维持正义，尊重由条约与国际法及其他渊源而起之义务”。
    美国和其他许多国家一样，从联合国建立以来，缔结了许多双边和多边的条约和协定。而主权国家为和平的利益而缔结任何调整它们同其他国家的关系的条约和协定的无可争辩的权利，从来没有受到过怀疑，而且也不会受到怀疑。
    还有一点也是不能不考虑到的，即如果世界上两个最大的国家苏联和美国的关系没有搞好，联合国宪章本身就不会充分有效力。只有我们两国实行合作，为实现联合国的宗旨而共同努力，联合国宪章才会更加有效。我想你会同意这一点的。
    据我的理解，引起你某些怀疑的是这样一点：既然联合国宪章是“许多国家之间的条约”，我们为什么建议你缔结“双边”条约。
    不过，你一定会同意，世界上两个最强的国家之间缔结一项友好合作条约就会使国际局势大大地健康起来。另一方面，我们同意同其他国家，包括英国和法国也缔结同样的条约。最后，关于北大西洋公约组织成员国和华沙条约成员国这两个国家集团之间缔结条约的建议也仍然是有效的。
    你在自己的信中公正地指出，为了建立世界和平，重要的是行动，而不是言词。缔结苏美友好合作条约将是这方面最重要的具体行动之一，因为我们两国如果承担起条约草案所规定的最重要的义务，就会加强信任，使得整个国际紧张局势趋向缓和。这就表示我们两国并不限于在口头上作希望友好的保证，而是开始在实际上实现我们所承担的义务。
    顺便可以指出，在日内瓦会议以后，在这方面已经采取了一些有助于缓和国际紧张局势的重要措施，因而很难同意日内瓦会议以后的时期辜负了各国人民的希望这种说法。
    苏联政府方面已经实行了一些旨在缓和国际紧张局势和加强各国之间的信任的措施。在这方面我想提一提以下几点：苏联在1955年把自己的武装部队裁减了64万人，苏联1956年的军费比1955年减少了96亿卢布，苏联放弃了在其他国家领土上的最后一个军事基地，即在芬兰的军事基地波卡拉半岛，苏联倡议缔结奥地利国家条约，结果所有外国军队撤出了奥地利，奥地利承担了执行永久中立政策的义务。
    苏联在缓和国际紧张局势和改善各国关系方面所作的另外一些努力也是大家都知道的。
    苏联人认为，其他国家也可以用实际行动来证实自己所说的话。但是，总统先生，如果坦率地说一句，那就应该说，某些大国不仅没有采取类似行动，而且相反，化了不少的气力来加剧国际紧张局势。
    尽管我们在日内瓦的会见产生了一些积极的结果，可是某些西方国家、包括美国，它们的军事拨款不但没有减少，反而增加了。美国在别国领土上的军事基地也增加了，而且这些基地主要是建筑在同苏联边界毗邻的地区。你一定会同意，这不可能不使苏联人民对美国所抱的意图产生完全可以理解的担忧。
    还不能不注意到：某些美国领导人不顾我跟你，总统先生，在日内瓦会议上互相作出的和平保证，而继续发表绝不能说是符合“日内瓦精神”的言论。大家都知道，比如，就在不久以前，美国有人发表了宣扬使国家保持在“战争边缘”的政策的言论。也不能不注意到北大西洋公约组织某些军事领袖的好战言论，他们公开号召继续扩充军备和在北大西洋公约组织的军队中储备原子武器，并且不惜以使用原子武器进行威胁。
    我们建议我们两国缔结友好合作条约的出发点是，缔结这个条约和改善我们两国之间的关系将有助于达到大量裁减军备和武装部队。例如，大家可以把五国的武装部队减少到美国和苏联都曾经同意的水平。就各国人民要求禁止的原子武器的问题达成协议也会有助于这一点。关于建立相应的国际监督的问题也就容易解决了。
    你在来信中再次提起注意你所提出的关于规定美国和苏联飞机相互飞临苏美两国领土的上空进行空中摄影的“开放天空”的建议以及交换军事情报的建议。我和我的同事已经有机会就这个建议表明了我们的态度。我们认为，在目前的国际局势中，特别是在毫无限制地扩充军备的条件下，进行这种飞行不但不会消除各国人民对新战争的恐惧，而且反而会加深这种恐惧和相互的猜疑。总统先生，请你自己判断一下：如果贵国的军事领导人接到报告，说空中摄影证明你们的邻国有更多的飞机场，那么他们会怎么办呢？他们一定会命令马上增建飞机场。我们的军事领导人在类似的情况下当然也会这样做的。不难理解，结果将是进一步加紧扩充军备。
    如果我们就裁减军备和武装部队达成协议，情形就会两样了。那时候进行相应的监督（关于监督的方法可以达成协议）就会是正确的和必要的。
    还不能不看到，苏联和美国两国保证只用和平方法解决两国之间一切争执问题，就是说在两国关系中放弃使用武力或者以武力进行威胁，——其中包括原子武器和氢武器——，这样就将真正使国际局势平静，并且将为就其他悬而未决的国际问题达成协议创造比较有利的条件。
    因此，美国和苏联两国之间缔结友好合作条约就意味着，如你在信中所说的，我们可以采取一些实际行动，“使世界相信，我们彼此之间没有任何侵略意图”。
    至于谈到你的信件中所涉及的具体国际问题。我依然认为，除裁军问题外，最重要的是保障欧洲安全的问题。苏联政府1955年秋天在日内瓦外交部长会议上提出了一些解决这一问题的具体建议。苏联政府像以前一样认为，在建立单一的全欧集体安全体系的基础上可以最妥善地解决有效地保障欧洲安全的问题。
    我们在建议中同时也照顾到西方三国在许多重大问题上的愿望，并且也考虑到西方国家代表在日内瓦会议期间提出的关于这一方面的具体主张。苏联政府提出的关于保障欧洲安全的建议中还充分考虑到美国在解决欧洲事务方面所起的重要的作用。
    但是，三国政府不同意我们的建议，而且针对我们的建议提出了这样一种计划，这个计划就是要在全德国重新实行军国主义化，同时还规定统一了的德国要加入西方国家建立的排他的军事集团。
    不难理解，这样的计划不可能作为解决保障欧洲真正安全的问题和解决德国问题的基础。
    既然欧洲在战后出现了两个德国并且它们已经巩固了，它们具有不同的社会和经济制度，沿着不同的道路发展，那么，不言而喻，把德国建立成为一个和平民主的统一国家的问题，如果在德国人自己之间、即德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间没有达成相应的协议，是不可能获得解决的。
    同时我相信，苏美两国关系的正常化、特别是缔结苏美友好合作条约这个步骤，在为解决德国问题提供必要前提方面也具有重大的积极意义。
    至于谈到你说的各国人民有权按照他们的愿望选择政府形式这一意见，那么必须指出，苏联始终一贯地遵循着这样一个原则：任何国家的国内制度是这个国家人民的内部事情。我们希望，其他国家在它们的国际关系中也将遵循这个原则。
    你在信里还谈到发展东西方之间的接触这样一个重要问题。我们完全同意你对这种接触的意义的看法。正因为这样，苏联才在去年秋天举行的外交部长会议上提出消除阻碍着正常的贸易和经济关系的发展的障碍，扩大文化、科学、艺术、体育和旅行等方面的接触。我们都很满意，日内瓦会议就这个问题曾经有过某种一致的看法。但是，美国和其他西方国家的代表团在最后提出了一些违反我和你、艾登先生，还有富尔先生对我们的外交部长们所作的指示的要求。苏联政府不能接受这些新要求，因为它们意味着直接干涉主权国家的内政。
    遗憾的是，就连苏联政府在发展我们各国的接触，包括在交换代表团这方面所采取的实际措施，也遭到美国方面的严重阻挠。
    我相信，我们能够用共同的努力来消除所谓“铁幕”，并且为广泛发展我们国家公民之间的直接接触创造条件。我希望，你会同意这个意见。
    毫无疑问，我们两国之间缔结友好合作条约在这个问题上也会具有重大的积极意义。
    这就是我想对你，尊敬的总统先生，表示的关于你的信中所提出的那些意见的看法。我很希望，这些意见将有助于说明我和我的同事为什么重视缔结苏美友好合作条约。
    我们这方面愿意十分仔细地研究你认为必须对条约草案的某些条文提出的任何意见。我等待着你对这个问题表示进一步的意见。
