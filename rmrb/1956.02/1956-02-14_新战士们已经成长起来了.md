    New Soldiers Have Grown Up
    To the Editor:
    Now, various localities are enlisting eligible young people into the armed forces. At this time, I would like to report to their families on the situation of the new soldiers who came to our company last year.
    The new soldiers who came to our company last year have now initially mastered military skills. In the process of learning military skills, officers, sergeants, and veteran soldiers have put in a lot of effort, and they themselves have also put in arduous labor. For example, Wang Youliang, a new soldier in the first squad of our unit, could never figure out how to form a line of sight when learning to aim. Deputy squad leader Zhou Youyu came up with a method: when Wang Youliang was practicing aiming, he ran a long line from the notch of the gun sight through the tip of the front sight all the way to the aiming point. In this way, Wang Youliang understood the essentials, and used all available time to practice. As a result, he achieved a "good" score in his first shooting test.
    New soldiers have not only mastered many combat skills, but their cultural level has also greatly improved. Most of the new soldiers could not even write their own names when they first came; now they can generally recognize about 400 characters, and some have learned to write letters and read newspapers.
    Military life has also exercised their physical strength. Zhang Wenqi, a new soldier in the second platoon, was originally weak, but after 4 months of training, his weight has greatly increased, and he won the championship in the chin-up competition in the military region's sports review.
    Our troops also pay great attention to the cultivation of new soldiers' character. Ye Jiacai, a new soldier in the heavy machine gun platoon, is an excellent soldier with good performance in performing tasks and good academic performance, and is often praised by the company leaders. However, once when he was cleaning his weapon, he broke the trigger spring of a carbine and quietly put the gun in the armory, trying to deceive others. Later, after the matter was clarified, he received a warning because he did not have the courage to admit his mistake and told a lie. This punishment was a beneficial education for Ye Jiacai. Since then, he has not only maintained his weapons very well, but also been able to correctly treat his own shortcomings and mistakes. Now he has joined the Communist Youth League.
    Under the careful help and guidance of officers, sergeants, and veteran soldiers, the new soldiers who enlisted last year have grown up after a year of training. They are now very concerned about the news of new recruits enlisting, and are preparing to bravely shoulder the burdens of veteran soldiers, and do everything possible to lead and educate the new comrades who enlist this year!

### 新战士们已经成长起来了

    新战士们已经成长起来了编辑同志：
    现在各地正在征集适龄青年入伍服役。在这个时候，我把去年到我们连队来的新战士的情况向他们的亲人们汇报一下。
    去年到我们连队里来的新战士们，现在已经初步掌握了军事技术。在他们学习军事技术的过程中，军官们、军士们和老战士们花了不少心血，而他们自己也付出了艰巨的劳动。如我部一班新战士王有亮在学习瞄准的时候总是弄不清怎样构成一条瞄准线。副班长周有玉就想出了一个法子：他在王有亮练习瞄准的时候把一根长线从枪支标尺的缺口通过准星尖一直引到瞄准点上。这样，王有亮明白了这个要领，利用一切空隙时间来练习，结果第一次打靶就取得了“良好”的成绩。
    新战士们不仅掌握了很多作战的本领，他们的文化程度也有很大的提高。大部分新战士刚来的时候连自己的名字都不会写；现在一般都可以认400来字，有的人已经学会写信、看报了。
    军事生活也锻炼了他们的体力。二排新战士张文起，原来身体瘦弱，经过4个月的锻炼，他的体重大大增加了，并且在军区体育检阅中，获得了单杠引体向上这项比赛的冠军。
    我们的部队还十分关怀对新战士品德的培养。重机枪排新战士叶家才，是一个优秀的战士，执行任务好，学习成绩也好，经常受到连首长的表扬。但是，他有一次擦拭武器，把一支步骑枪的板机簧弄断了，就悄悄地把枪放在兵器室里，企图蒙蔽过去。后来事情查明白了，由于他没有勇气承认错误而说了谎话，因此受到了警告的处分。这次处分对叶家才是一个有益的教育。以后他不但把武器保养得很好，而且也能够正确地对待自己的缺点和错误。现在他已经加入了青年团。
    去年应征服役的新战士，在军官、军士和老战士们的尽心帮助和教导下，经过一年的锻炼，已经成长起来了。他们现在十分关心地听候着新兵入伍的消息，准备勇敢地担负起老战士的担子，尽一切努力，带领和教育好今年应征服役的新同志！
