Promoting Reinforced Concrete Utility Poles

To conserve steel, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry will build three new and expand two existing factories for prefabricating reinforced concrete utility poles this year. 80% of the new transmission lines constructed this year will use concrete poles.

Using concrete poles to erect power transmission lines is efficient, safe, and can reduce costs. For 110 kV transmission lines, using concrete poles saves 47% of the investment compared to using iron towers. Under normal circumstances, lines built with concrete poles save 30%-40% of the steel compared to lines built with iron towers. The service life of concrete poles is several times longer than that of wooden poles. According to calculations, the concrete pole lines to be erected by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry this year will save at least 24 million yuan in investment and 7,600 tons of steel compared to erecting iron towers.

The widespread adoption of concrete poles is of great significance for saving steel and wood. In addition to high-voltage transmission lines, concrete poles should also be used for low-voltage distribution lines and new transmission and distribution lines in cities.

    推广钢筋混凝土电杆
    电力工业部为了节约钢材，今年将新建三个和扩建两个预制钢筋 混凝土电杆的工厂，今年新建的输电线路将有80％采用水泥电杆。
    用水泥电杆架设输电线，运行好，使用安全，还可降低成本。在110千伏的输电线路上，用水泥电杆比用铁塔节省47％的投资。在一般情况下，用水泥电杆建设的线路比铁塔建设的线路节省30％—40％的钢材。水泥电杆的使用年限比木电杆要多几倍。据计算，今年电力工业部要架设的水泥电杆线路，比架铁塔至少可节省投资2，400万元，节省钢材7，600吨。
    广泛采用水泥电杆，对节省钢材和木材有重大的意义。除高压输电线路外，在低压配电线路上和城市中的新建输配电线路上都应该采用。
