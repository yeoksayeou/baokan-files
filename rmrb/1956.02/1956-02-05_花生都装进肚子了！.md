    "Peanuts All Gone Into Their Stomachs!"
    To the Editor:
    The state assigned a task to Shuanglong Township, Deyang County, Sichuan, last year to purchase 140,000 jin of peanuts, but by December, the township had only purchased 70,000 jin. It turned out that many farmers had eaten large quantities of peanuts. For example, the Huang Yunhai family in the sixth village, with eight people, had a large basket of peanuts under each person's bed; they ate them during the day, ate them at night, and even woke up in the middle of the night to eat them. Before long, they had eaten more than 100 jin. Farmer Li Changgui always carried peanuts in his pocket, eating them wherever he went. When the township wanted to purchase peanuts from him, he wiped his mouth and said, "The peanuts have all gone into my stomach." This phenomenon also existed to varying degrees in other townships in Deyang County.
    Why did this phenomenon occur? The main reason is that the local leading bodies did not conduct in-depth political education among the farmers, which led some farmers to mistakenly believe that "it's better to eat them ourselves since we can't buy oil even if we sell the oilseeds!" In fact, since the implementation of fixed-quantity supply of edible oil, the state has been continuously increasing the supply of edible oil to farmers. The amount of edible oil received by farmers in Deyang County is now twice as much as in the past. If we educate the farmers about the consistency of national and individual interests through these concrete examples, they will consciously cherish oilseeds and enthusiastically sell oilseeds to the state.

### “花生都装进肚子了！”

    “花生都装进肚子了！”
    编辑同志：
    国家去年分配给四川德阳县双龙乡收购花生14万斤的任务，但到12月份这个乡只收购了花生7万斤。原来，许多农民已经把大量的花生都吃掉了。例如六村的黄云海家有八口人，每个人床下都放着一大筐花生；白天吃，晚上吃，半夜醒了也吃，没有多久就吃掉100多斤。农民李昌贵的衣袋里总装着花生，走到那里吃到那里；当乡里要向他收购花生的时候，他擦擦嘴说：“花生都装进肚子了。”这种现象，在德阳县其他乡里也程度不同地存在着。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？主要原因是当地领导机关没有深入对农民进行政治教育，以致有些农民错误地认为：“卖了油料买不到油，还不如自己吃了好！”事实上，自从实行食油定量供应以后，国家对农民的食油供应量是不断地提高的，德阳县农民所得到的食油量，就比过去提高了一倍。如果通过这些具体事例来教育农民认识国家利益和个人利益的一致性，他们是会自觉地爱惜油料，并且踊跃向国家出售油料的。
