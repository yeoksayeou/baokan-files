Shaanxi Province will eliminate soil and water erosion hazards in the Yellow River Basin within the province by 1962, ahead of schedule, according to the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft).

The original 15-year soil and water conservation plan for Shaanxi Province stipulated that by 1967, the amount of sediment transported to the Yellow River would be reduced by 67%, and soil erosion would be controlled over an area of more than 70,000 square kilometers. Recently, at the provincial agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and soil and water conservation work conference, cadres at all levels, in accordance with the spirit of the 1956-1967 National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), deeply criticized right-leaning conservative thinking and revised the soil and water conservation plan. After careful calculations and brainstorming, they not only shortened the time to complete the task, but also improved various indicators. According to the revised plan, by 1962, more than 30 million mu of terraced fields and other field projects, more than 130,000 silt-retaining dams, and more than 2,000 large earth dams will be built in the Yellow River Basin within Shaanxi Province. These indicators are 50% to more than double the original plan. By that time, the more than 500 million metric tons of sediment that Shaanxi Province inputs into the Yellow River each year will be reduced by about 90%, and soil erosion will be controlled over an area of more than 100,000 square kilometers. Because of the soil and water conservation in these areas, grain production will increase by 7.1 billion jin.

Currently, leading organs and agricultural producers' cooperatives at all levels in mountainous areas and the Loess Plateau are beginning to plan for the rational use of land, conserve soil and water, and comprehensively develop the mountain economy to ensure the completion of the new provincial soil and water conservation plan.

    陕西省将提前消灭省内黄河流域的水土冲刷灾害
    根据全国农业发展纲要（草案）的要求，陕西省将提前在1962年基本消灭本省境内黄河流域的水土冲刷灾害。
    过去陕西省制定的15年水土保持计划规定，到1967年减少向黄河输沙量67％，控制水土流失面积7万多平方公里。最近在全省农、林、水利、水土保持工作会议上，各级干部按照1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）的精神，深入批判了右倾保守思想，修改了水土保持的计划。经过算细账、找窍门，不仅缩短了完成任务的时间，还提高了各项指标。按照修改后的计划，到1962年，陕西省境内黄河流域将修建3，000多万亩梯田等田间工程、13万多道淤地坝和2，000多座大型土坝。这几项指标比原计划扩大50％到两倍以上。到那个时候，陕西省每年输入黄河的5亿多公吨泥沙将减少90％左右，控制水土流失面积达10万多平方公里。这些地区因为保持了水土，粮食产量将增加71亿斤。
    现在，山区和黄土高原区的各级领导机关和农业生产合作社，正在着手规划合理利用土地，保持水土，全面发展山区经济，以保证完成新的全省水土保持计划。
