Comrades! I fully agree with the report of the Central Committee of the Party. Now I would like to speak about some aspects of the work of the Central Committee.

In the report of the Central Committee, some new circumstances and events in the modern history of mankind were studied. The Central Committee has illuminated these circumstances and events with the brilliant light of Marxism-Leninism and has drawn some important, theoretically bold and principled conclusions about the laws of social development and their utilization under modern conditions. Some fundamental problems of Marxism adapted to modern conditions have been raised. The conclusions drawn from these problems have not only theoretical value but also a programmatic character and have great practical significance for the correct communist policy in the future stages of development. This has greatly enriched Marxism-Leninism and made a valuable contribution to the Marxist-Leninist science of social development. (Applause)

The conclusions and arguments contained in Comrade Khrushchev's report show that our Central Committee is not simply repeating the well-known Marxist-Leninist arguments. As the most experienced communist party in historical experience, this is what should be done. The Central Committee, guided by the powerful Marxist method of understanding the laws of social development, understands modern social development events, explains these events from a Marxist standpoint, and arms the working class with such conclusions which now not only generalize and explain the facts and events of the times of Marx and Lenin, but also generalize and explain the events that have occurred subsequently, whether in capitalist countries or socialist countries. I would like to speak about some of the problems mentioned, because they have extremely great importance and relevance.

The main characteristic of the work of the Central Committee and its Presidium over the past three years is that collective leadership has been established in our party after a long interruption. (Applause)

Our party now has a strong and united leadership, the strength of which does not only lie in the fact that it is composed of comrades who have worked together for many years in the revolutionary struggle, which is of course important, but mainly in the fact that this collective, guided by Leninist thought, the principles of Leninist party building and party leadership, has in a short time restored the Leninist norms of party life from top to bottom. (Applause)

The principle of collective leadership is the fundamental principle of a proletarian, Leninist party, and therefore it is necessary to emphasize this truth which has always existed, because for about 20 years we actually did not have collective leadership, and the cult of personality, which was criticized by Marx and later by Lenin, prevailed. Of course, this could not but have an extremely harmful effect on the state of the party and the work of the party. And now, when in the last three years, collective leadership of the Communist Party has been restored on the basis of Leninist principles and Leninist unity, the beneficial effects of the Leninist method of leadership are felt. The main source of the new strength that has been given to our party in recent years is also here. This is the important premise of the achievements described in Comrade Khrushchev's report, and it is also a guarantee that the party will proceed with greater confidence and more victory along the path of building communism. (Applause)

In recent years, among other urgent and pressing issues, the Central Committee has paid particular attention to ensuring the rapid development of industry, primarily heavy industry, to the struggle for technological progress in industry, transport, agriculture, and trade, and to the struggle for high labor productivity and high-quality industrial products. This is also reflected in the summary report.

The main concern is to eliminate the backwardness of agriculture and to eliminate the imbalance in the development of industry and agriculture caused by it, which is extremely harmful to our country, and if it continues to exist, it will seriously hinder our development. This problem has been addressed through a series of measures, including increasing the material interests of collective farm members and the cultivation of virgin lands. In the past two years, 33 million hectares of new land have been cultivated. Could we have ever imagined such a thing before?

At the same time, what has happened in American agriculture? The American government proposed in January to the Congress a plan to stop cultivating 10 million hectares of land. This is a direct destruction of agricultural productivity, one of the most obvious manifestations of the decay of capitalism. It turns out that in America, the problem of virgin and fallow land is also raised, only in the opposite direction and in the American way. They do not cultivate land, but turn cultivated land into fallow and virgin land. (The hall is lively.) This is happening in a country that seeks to seize "world leadership," in a country where, according to official materials of the United Nations, there are more and more people without sufficient food in the capitalist world, reaching 59% of the total world population, while in 1939 it was 31%. It is at this time that in America they propose to destroy 10 million hectares of cultivated land.

Behind the delusion of "world leadership," one can understand what is hidden: in 1955, American and British oil monopolies extracted 150 million tons of oil in the Near East, spending a total of 240 million dollars, that is, unbelievably cheap. And the pure profit they gained from this oil was 1.9 billion dollars, they recouped their entire investment in this oil region in one year, and in Kuwait, they received a profit equal to the entire investment in this period in one quarter. In America, the oil industry needs at least six or seven years to recoup the investment.

If all the profits from oil belonged to its lawful owners—the Arab people and the people of other Near Eastern countries—then these countries could quickly overcome poverty and make up for the losses caused by the ruthless exploitation of foreign capital over many years in economic and cultural development.

This notorious "world leadership" is also manifested in the invention of various new forms of hidden exploitation. Many countries in Asia and Africa have already freed themselves from the status of colonial dependencies, but due to the control of American and British monopolies, in their foreign markets, they, as the people of backward countries themselves say, are forced to accept unjust prices, that is, a special "scissors" between export and import prices. Because of this, compared to the beginning of the century, these countries can now (according to UN materials) exchange for the same quantity of goods they exported only 40% less than what these countries could import at that time. This is what is called "concern" and "aid" for backward countries!

Now let us return to the problem of the development of our agriculture. It should be said that the correction of the situation in our agriculture is due to the following reasons: the most important crops have been rationally distributed, agricultural work has been fully mechanized, the organization and leadership of agriculture have been reorganized, and the arrangement of agricultural planning work has been changed. The harmful bureaucratic method of planning from the center has been abolished, and the planning of the area under cultivation and the yield per unit area, the number of livestock and the productivity of livestock products has been handed over to the collective farms themselves, while the center is only responsible for determining the quantities to be delivered and sold to the state.

All these measures ensure that agriculture can rise rapidly, the imbalance in our economy can be eliminated, and the alliance between the working class and the peasants can be greatly strengthened.

Now the productivity of agricultural products has increased, which has led to a significant increase in the production of food and industrial goods for civilian consumption.

The task has been set to increase the production of consumer goods by the end of the sixth five-year plan to nearly 3.5 times the pre-war level of 1940, including meat and fish by 3.2 times, canned goods by 5.6 times, animal fats by 3.9 times—almost four times, sugar by three times, silk fabrics by fourteen times, woolen fabrics by three times, sewing machines by twenty-two times, and clocks by twelve times. Therefore, to increase the production of today's most scarce daily necessities at such a high rate, it is because our Party Central Committee has paid attention to the fact that there are shortages and queues for certain goods in trade in some places. Sometimes people raise such questions: can individual shortages and queues for scarce goods in trade be avoided? Are these phenomena inevitable in socialist trade? Of course not. These phenomena occur when there is no correct balance between the available quantity of goods and the demand that residents can afford.

In a socialist society, goods must be in excess of demand. The growing demand drives the development of commodity production forward. The whole question is the degree of this excess. A serious imbalance between the available quantity of goods and the monetary income of residents will cause disharmony in the circulation sphere and become a bad phenomenon in Soviet trade, resulting in queues and shortages of certain goods, causing inconvenience to residents, reducing the quality of trade services, and making it difficult to improve the quality of goods.

Now we have sufficient possibilities to eliminate this imbalance. With the correct plan, it will be possible in the future not to have this imbalance in the circulation sphere, and it will be possible to eliminate the queues and shortages in trade that exist in some places in the first few years of the five-year plan. Achieving this will definitely create the necessary conditions for customers, improve the level of trade, improve service to customers, and ensure that the quality of a large number of goods is raised to the level of domestic and foreign first-class goods, and raise the entire trade and public catering industry to a new, higher level that meets the requirements of a socialist society. (Applause)

The correct relationship between supply and demand will be achieved by the following means: rapidly increasing the production of scarce goods, and in the future, implementing a price reduction policy that is based on the increase in the quantity of goods and the improvement of the purchasing power of residents.

It should be frankly admitted that the business of our shops and canteens is worse than that of good shops and canteens abroad. We must admit this in order to make greater efforts to raise the level of trade and public catering to a corresponding level. At the same time, it is necessary to expand the network of shops and canteens, because we do not have enough of them; it is necessary to re-equip them technically; it is necessary to improve the organization of business, and to implement the method of self-service in canteens and shops. As much as possible, use automatic machines, there are about 2 million automatic vending machines in the United States, while we have very few. With automatic vending machines, customers will be more convenient, the cost of circulation will be reduced, and the labor productivity of trade workers will be improved.

In order to fundamentally improve trade and public catering, it is necessary to complete the transfer of trade enterprises from local management to the local Soviets of Labor People's Deputies, widely attract the most active members of the staff and housewives to constantly supervise and improve trade and public catering. Who else will first notice all the shortcomings in trade, conduct inspections and strive to eliminate these shortcomings? The trade unions should play a decisive role in supervision, and the local Soviets are responsible for eliminating the shortcomings that have been exposed.

An important aspect of the activities of our Central Committee is: the relentless struggle against bureaucratic centralization, the full establishment of Leninist democratic centralism; the protection and strengthening of the alliance of the Soviet peoples and the sovereignty of the Union republics, the transfer to them of matters within their competence—these matters were previously centralized in the center, which was wrong, for example, now transferring a large number of industrial enterprises from the center to local authorities; strengthening the rights of local Soviets and enterprises, attracting the working masses to widely participate in the drafting and examination of economic plans, and more actively participating in the decision of production management issues; streamlining state institutions, fighting against the arrogance, pride, boastfulness, and bureaucratic style that have brought us so much harm, and fully developing criticism and self-criticism without regard to face.

Among other major measures, it is necessary to point out the division of the State Planning Commission into two State Planning Commissions—one for long-term planning and one for current planning, in order to establish a correct connection between future needs and today's needs, and to prevent the occurrence of imbalances in the economy under the mutual supervision of these two bodies.

We know how much Lenin cared about the planned nature of economic development, and we can believe that the decision of the Central Committee to reorganize the State Planning Commission under today's conditions is in line with the requirements that Lenin once made to the State Planning Commission.

In the capitalist world, economic proportions are established spontaneously through competition, the anarchy of production, and crises. The proportions of the socialist economy are different; they are established by the will of an organized society and by a scientific plan based on the requirements of the objective laws of economic development. Therefore, the planned nature of development in the economy and the inadmissibility of serious imbalances depend on the correct and scientifically based drafting of the plan.

Comrade Khrushchev's report is not just a report on what has been done. The report of the Central Committee submitted to the Congress for discussion and the draft directive on the sixth five-year plan propose a great and detailed program aimed at accelerating the march towards communism. This program discusses the paths of development of industry and the entire national economy, discusses what needs to be done to ensure a further significant improvement in the living standards of the people in accordance with the growing possibilities of the socialist system.

On the one hand, we put forward the task of catching up with and surpassing capitalist countries in terms of production per capita, and on the other hand, we also put forward the task of catching up with and surpassing the richest capitalist countries in terms of consumption per capita, and ensuring that our country has an extremely rich and abundant variety of consumer goods. (Applause)

There are also many other extremely important social measures, such as shortening the working day, raising the wages of low-paid workers and employees, providing more help and benefits in the education of children and the support of elderly parents, methods such as building houses for the elderly and setting up corresponding pensions, free education, universal establishment of kindergartens and nurseries, organizing dormitories for schoolchildren, providing school breakfasts, and widely establishing public canteens. Finally, there are measures to accelerate the solution of the housing problem and improve public health and national education.

Raising the wages of low-paid workers means eliminating a certain imbalance in our economy, eliminating the excessive disparity that has arisen between the wages of low-paid and high-paid workers. When we were still in the stage of a peasant country and were implementing industrialization, such a disparity was natural, because this was the only way to stimulate the rapid formation of highly skilled workers, which the state desperately needed at the time.

Now, when there is a highly skilled, highly educated working class, supplemented by people graduating from seven-year and ten-year schools every year, the difference should still be maintained, but it should be reduced. This is the requirement of our new level of development, this means a step forward on the road to communism.

All this is the budding of communism. They open the way to the communist way of life. All this makes us all feel elated. Let those Americans who boast of their wealth and their "American way of life" know this, let them compete with us in this regard, to make them believe: where more is done for the welfare of the people, where the way of life is better. Let everyone replace the arms race with such a competition. Such a competition is more to the liking of us Soviet people, and also to the liking of the American people! (Applause)

Some issues of foreign policy

The achievements of the Soviet Union's foreign policy are very significant, especially in the past year. The leadership of the party has brought new fresh air to this area, implementing a highly principled, active, flexible, calm and resolute foreign policy without insults. This policy is based on the unshakable Leninist legacy that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and its main goal is to eliminate the threat of war and defend peace throughout the world.

When our foreign policy made certain mistakes in the past, when in some cases relations were strained due to our fault, our government was not afraid to publicly explain international issues related to such facts. This has surprised many bourgeois individuals. The Soviet government is resolutely moving forward on the path of eliminating the shortcomings in its foreign policy work. The solution to the problem of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is a well-known and most obvious example. Of course, the steps taken by the Central Committee in the period between the 19th and 20th Party Congresses on the Yugoslav question could only be taken by a true Leninist. Now it is clear how correct these bold steps were, and how effective they were for the cause of peace and socialism. (Applause)

There are other measures: the withdrawal of our military bases in China and Finland, the abolition of joint-stock companies in people's democratic countries, the signing of a treaty with Austria, etc., all of which show the boldness of our policy, its principled nature, respect for the sovereignty of other countries, its activity, and the effectiveness that follows.

As Marxism-Leninism teaches us, when formulating foreign policy, we consider the specific features of the situation and the actual balance of forces, correctly assess the policies of various countries in a certain period, first of all in the main issue we consider—the issue of peace. Thus, the rigid methods of our foreign agencies, foreign trade agencies, and economic agencies in dealing with foreigners and foreign citizens have been abandoned, the phenomenon of isolation of Soviet social organizations and state institutions from the outside world has been eliminated, and contacts between Soviet and foreign government officials, party activists, and social organizations have been expanded.

In the destruction of international ties, the role of the American aggression group is well known. However, they try to shift the blame onto others, attributing the fault to the Soviet people, and they have come up with a set of familiar arguments, saying that the Soviet Union has raised the "Iron Curtain." They call this a sign of the "weakness of the Soviet system," a sign of our fear of all the consequences that may arise from contact between Soviet people and foreigners. They even say that such contact will shake our state system.

We quickly dispelled this myth and established extensive contacts with foreigners in state affairs and social affairs, in art, tourism, sports, etc.

Our contacts with some democratic countries have developed very well and have great prospects for further development. In relations with certain countries, such as the United States, things are not going smoothly due to the direct opposition of the State Department, despite the ardent hopes of the American people and many American social organizations.

There is also such a ridiculous example. Representatives of the American hotel industry came to Moscow as guests last year, visited famous sights, and visited all the enterprises they were interested in—hotels, canteens. We did not even raise the question of sending our people to visit the United States on a reciprocal basis. The American guests were satisfied with our hospitality and directly invited Moscow hotel industry specialists to visit their public catering enterprises. Thus, the arrangement of contacts in this area began. Soon, five workers from Moscow public catering enterprises planned to go to the United States, and the State Department suddenly announced that it considered their visit to the United States inappropriate. (The hall is lively, laughter.) Obviously, for some people in the State Department, even our cooks and chefs are dangerous. (Laughter, applause) Who supports contact and who opposes it, in this small matter anyone will understand.

We have exposed the lies spread by foreign hostile groups about the aggressive nature of Soviet policy and have thoroughly proven the peaceful nature of this policy. We have dispelled the foolish fabrication that we supposedly fear contact with foreigners.

Even the idea that communists fear contact with capitalist countries is laughable. Whose social system is better, the Soviet Union's or the capitalist countries'? Whose ideas are superior, ours of Marxism-Leninism or the capitalist world's? Indeed, the capitalist world had its own great ideals during the French Revolution, but in its twilight, it has no advanced ideas. The old ideals have become outdated, and the new ideals of striving for human progress, in the capitalist system now, there are none and cannot be, because it is an outdated system, it has already been on the historical cart. (The hall is lively, applause)

The West boasts of its freedom and democracy, which is really laughable. How can bourgeois democracy be compared with proletarian, socialist democracy, which gives people complete and true freedom, while bourgeois democracy establishes and maintains the exploitation of man by man under the guise of equality.

The report of the Central Committee correctly discussed Soviet socialist democracy, which is incomparably superior to any bourgeois democracy.

Only the working class, as the leading force of modern society, and the Communist Party, as the embodiment of the ideology of the working class, can have and can only have the only progressive ideal. There is no more progressive thought than Marxism-Leninism. (Applause)

The era of the isolation of Soviet socialist countries, when we were an oasis in the midst of capitalism, has passed. Now there is no such question. Now, in addition to the system of capitalist countries, there is a system of socialist countries united by eternal friendship, common historical fate, and the common desire to ensure world peace. Now, without considering the opinions of the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries, it is no longer possible to solve any major international issue, considering only the will of the Western powers. The great power of the socialist world lies not only in the fact that 13 countries with about 1 billion people in Europe and Asia have built socialism, but also in the fact that in many countries ruled by capitalism, socialist ideas have captured the vast majority of the working people and the majority of humanity. Most of the world's people are either under the banner of socialism, building socialism (the Soviet Union has already built socialism), or fighting for the right to build socialism.

100 years ago, Marx and Engels said: "A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of communism." Now, it is no longer a specter, but real communism, something tangible and close to millions of working people, communism is advancing with confident steps not only in Europe but in the whole world, its fame is resounding. (Applause) The influence of communist ideas on the life of modern human society is immeasurably growing.

From the point of view of the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, against war, against the threat of war, for international peace, for the freedom and independence of the peoples of the world, it can be boldly said that the absolute majority of mankind is on our side in the common struggle. This determines the fundamental change in the balance of forces of peace and war in the world, as well as the balance of forces of socialism and capitalism. Now it is no longer possible to say that capitalism is stronger than socialism just because many rich and well-armed countries remain capitalist. In the minds of all mankind, socialism is now incomparably stronger than capitalism.

This is why we are not afraid of the struggle between socialist and capitalist ideas, this is why our party and its representatives, Comrade Khrushchev and Comrade Bulganin, were so bold during their visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, to spit on colonialism and to openly say that we are against war, and we advocate a competition between the two social systems, advocating a struggle between the two ideologies under the conditions of peaceful coexistence.

When talking about coexistence, it is necessary to express an opinion on the issue of international trade. Americans are intoxicated with their illusions, thinking that if they restrict trade with socialist countries, they can somehow hinder the development of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries.

However, even in the West, few people believe this anymore, because everyone sees that now the socialist world economy almost produces everything it needs itself, and in the main commodities, it can meet the current needs of the socialist camp countries. To prove this, there is such an example: since the Western countries tied their own hands with the embargo on China, they have only been able to stare blankly at the important issue of China's industrialization, which could have made some of them reduce production in the inevitable crisis period.

We firmly believe that without trade, stable coexistence is unimaginable, because even after the formation of two world markets, trade is still a good basis for such coexistence. The existence of two world markets, the socialist market and the capitalist market, not only does not exclude the development of mutually beneficial trade between all countries of the world, but on the contrary, provides the basis for such trade. From the point of view of the coexistence of the two worlds, correctly understanding this issue has both principled and practical economic significance.

Our starting point is that trade with capitalist countries is beneficial to both sides and has objective prerequisites for further development of such trade. This is determined by the necessity of social division of labor, by such a well-known principle: not all countries produce all products equally advantageously. In this country, it is easier to produce this product, and in another country, it is easier to produce another product; the level of development of various sectors is different; the habits of the working class and production traditions, etc., all have an impact on this. In this sense, international trade in the past and now is a manifestation of rational international division of labor, and this role is even increasing.

On the possibility of the peaceful development of the socialist revolution in various countries

Comrades! Among the theoretical problems discussed in the report of the Central Committee, the most acute and principal is the question: is it necessary for the socialist revolution to be realized by armed uprising in any country, at any time, and under any conditions, or is it possible for the revolution to develop peacefully?

Is the widespread view that the socialist revolution is inevitably linked with bloody civil war correct?

The ideologists and propagandists of capitalism portray communists as bloodthirsty, as people who are always and everywhere ready to use violence, as people who strive to instigate civil war. Just from this point of view, the importance of the above question can be seen. Those ideologists and propagandists portray all this as the inevitable demand of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as the inevitable product of the struggle for communism. They have always tried and are still trying to use this to cause terror and panic among the people who spontaneously and consciously tend towards socialist ideas.

What is our view on these questions? Comrade Khrushchev's report has given a clear answer to these questions.

Everyone knows that before the First World War, the Bolsheviks considered armed uprising to be the path to the victory of the revolution in Russia. During the First World War, the Bolsheviks put forward the slogan of turning the imperialist war into a civil war. Our position at that time was correct and important. Because at that time, turning the imperialist war into a civil war was the only means to stop the great slaughter and for the peoples of the countries to achieve peace and freedom.

As a result of the February Revolution, the working people of Russia gained even more democratic freedoms than in the country then called the most democratic—America. Later, Lenin, considering the changed situation, put forward in the famous April Theses the slogan of the seizure of power by the working class and the completion of the socialist revolution by peaceful means, through gaining a majority in the Soviets.

Only after the July events, that is, after the temporary government shot peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Petrograd, was the slogan of peaceful development of the revolution abandoned, because the situation had changed. It was necessary to use force against the violence of the bourgeoisie preparing the Kornilov coup, and it was necessary to seize power through an uprising.

In fact, the October Revolution was almost completed peacefully, because before that, in the Congress of Soviets and in many Soviets, the majority had already become revolutionaries. This made it possible for the Soviets to seize power without serious bloodshed.

After the October Revolution, Lenin and the Bolsheviks did not call for a civil war and the use of violence. No. The party immediately drew up a plan for the peaceful development of Russia. In particular, Lenin also called for an agreement with Russian and foreign capitalists, with those willing to work under the supervision of the Soviet power in the economic sphere. He proposed to give foreign capitalists the right to lease and establish enterprises of the state capitalist type.

So, how did the civil war that brought so much suffering to our people begin?

The whole world knows that the instigators of the civil war were the imperialist countries, the bloody civil war was not started by the revolution, but by the counter-revolution, not by the Bolsheviks, but against their will.

Based on the above, what conclusions can we draw? When was Lenin correct, in what circumstances?

When he called for armed uprising and demanded the transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war before and during the First World War, was he correct? Or was he correct when he put forward the slogan of the peaceful development of the revolution in the first few months after the February Revolution? Or was he correct when he again put forward the slogan of armed uprising after the July events?

When and in what circumstances was he correct? The answer can only be one—Lenin was correct in all these circumstances.

Lenin never started from dogma, nor did he cling to out-of-date slogans. He started from the requirements of life, which cannot be constant. Lenin correctly considered the actual balance of class forces and deeply understood the tendency of their further development, and only then put forward the slogans of the time. Marxists should do this and only this, otherwise, the slogans will become dead dogmas that hinder the leadership of the proletarian party in the movement. Lenin was always uneasy about this, and he especially emphasized that "any slogan has the possibility of hardening itself." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 28, p. 203)

Our situation is like this. Marx, Engels, and Lenin had the same view on this issue for other countries, and they always stressed that everything depends on the period of development, the balance of class forces, and the specific circumstances.

Marx, in the 1870s, believed that the prerequisite for any true people's revolution in Europe was to "smash the bureaucratic-military state machine." He considered Britain and the countries across the Atlantic as exceptions, where the working class at that time could gain power by peaceful means, through winning a majority in parliament. In 1872, Marx said at a mass meeting in Amsterdam about the seizure of power:

"...We have never asserted that the method of achieving this goal must be exactly the same.
We know that in some countries, one must take into account the institutions, customs, and traditions there; at the same time, we do not deny that, like America, Britain, (if I knew better about your country's institutions, I might also include Holland in these countries), the working class in these places can achieve its goals by peaceful means.
However, even so, we must admit that in most countries on the continent, force should be our revolutionary tool; for the final establishment of the rule of labor, we must use force for a certain period." (Marx and Engels, Collected Works, Vol. 13, Part 2, p. 669)

This is how Marx understood the different paths of revolutionary development in different countries.

Lenin wrote in 1917 that in the new situation of monopoly capitalism, due to the development of the police-bureaucratic apparatus in Britain and the United States, the special situation that Marx spoke of no longer existed. Lenin sharply criticized Kautsky and other renegades who tried to cling to the words Marx said above, tried to put forward the "peaceful path" as a principle for all countries and all periods of development, but they understood the peaceful path in their own way, in a reformist way, and they tried to detach the proletariat from the revolutionary struggle for the seizure of power.

It can be seen that the methods of seizing power cannot be the same in different periods, in different international situations, for different countries. All this depends on the specific balance of class forces, on the degree of organization of the working class and its enemies, on the ability of the working class to win allies, first of all, the peasants. At the same time, one must also consider the institutions, customs, and traditions of each country.

Lenin drew attention to this: "As for the forms, methods, and means of transformation, Marx neither bound himself nor bound the future activists of the socialist revolution. He brilliantly understood that a large number of new problems would arise in the future, and how the environment would change in the process of transformation, how this environment would frequently and sharply change in the process of transformation." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 32, p. 316)

This is Lenin's understanding, this is the Leninist view on the strategic issues of the proletariat in the revolutionary struggle.

Marx and Lenin believed that the development of history made it so that for the vast majority of countries, armed uprising is the law and the main path for the proletariat to seize power, while they considered the peaceful path as a favorable exception for the working people. They never ignored the possibility of such a peaceful path. Lenin always emphasized that "of course, the working class would like to seize power peacefully." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 4, p. 254)

Title: On the Question of the Peaceful Transition to Socialism

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 25th.

    It is necessary to emphasize that Lenin believed that even when the proletariat has to resort to force, the main and constant feature of the revolution and the condition for its victory is organizational and constructive work, not destructive work.

    In his speech in memory of Sverdlov, Lenin said: "There is no doubt that without this feature—without revolutionary violence—the proletariat cannot be victorious. However, it is also impossible to doubt that revolutionary violence is necessary and natural only in a certain period of the revolution's development, only under certain and special conditions, while the deeper and more constant nature of the revolution and the condition for its victory has always been and still is the organization of the proletarian masses, the organization of the working people. To organize the masses of working people in this way is the best condition for the revolution and the deepest source of its victory" (Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 29, p. 70).

    From Lenin's time to the present, the world situation has fundamentally changed. This allows our Central Committee to propose, on the basis of the same Marxist-Leninist principles, the question of the forms of transition to socialism in various countries in a new way.

    The main factor in the fundamental change in the international situation is the emergence, strengthening, and consolidation of a powerful socialist camp. In the Soviet Union, a socialist society has been built. Great China and the people's democracies are rapidly advancing along the path of socialist construction. The world socialist system has been established, consolidated, and is continuously developing, while the world capitalist system is in a state of crisis, weakening, and continuously losing its positions.

    The colonial system is increasingly disintegrating, which was once a major reserve force of capitalism. The peoples of India, Burma, Indonesia, and Egypt have embarked on the path of free development; the peoples of all colonies and semi-colonies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are striving for freedom and complete independence.

    The organizational strength and class consciousness of the working class in capitalist countries have increased.

    When we talk about the question of the path of revolution in the present stage, as Marx and Lenin did in their time, we must correctly consider the balance of class forces within each country and on a global scale. Everyone understands that in our era, no country can develop in isolation without being influenced to some extent by other countries.

    Lenin long ago foresaw that under the conditions of the existence of many socialist countries, small bourgeois states could possibly transition to socialism through peaceful means. Lenin taught us that we should not only consider the balance of class forces within a single country but also take into account the fact that socialism has already triumphed in neighboring countries.

    Based on these circumstances, the Central Committee's summary report concludes that under the current conditions, there is the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism in individual countries. In other words, due to the balance of class forces within the country and the overall favorable situation mentioned above, the working class in some countries, after forming an alliance with the peasants, can unite the majority of the people under its leadership and seize power through peaceful means, that is, without armed uprising or civil war, but by utilizing existing parliamentary institutions. Of course, the development of the revolution can only take a peaceful path under the condition that the working class has the strength, organization, and class consciousness.

    In other cases, when the bourgeoisie controls a powerful military and police apparatus, it will inevitably force the proletariat into armed struggle to defend its rule. The proletariat must be prepared for this.

    The principles of revolutionary Marxism-Leninism, proven by life, convince us that the Central Committee's formulation of the question is correct. After Lenin's death, the socialist revolution has been victorious in more than ten countries. How did this happen?

    Let us take China as an example. In this great country, a civil war has been waged for several decades. There, the revolutionary army has long been engaged in a bloody struggle against foreign imperialists and the counter-revolutionary forces of the landlord-bourgeoisie compradors. The proletariat and its Communist Party took the lead in the armed struggle against feudalism and imperialism, and achieved victory in this struggle, ensuring the possibility of transitioning to socialist transformation through peaceful means.

    Leninism has deeply penetrated the minds and hearts of millions of outstanding people in China. Leninism has shown the Chinese people the reliable path to socialism, Leninism has blossomed and borne fruit on Chinese soil, and has enriched the great experience of the Chinese revolution. (Applause)

    We wish the Chinese Communist Party complete victory in the construction of socialism in this great Eastern country. (Applause)

    The process of the Yugoslav revolution is also unique. From the very beginning of the war launched by fascist Germany against the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Communist Party led the uprising against the fascist yoke; part of the Yugoslav bourgeoisie fled abroad, away from the struggle against fascism, while another part collaborated with the fascists and became accomplices of the occupation regime. Therefore, the Yugoslav anti-fascist guerrilla war merged with the domestic war against the Yugoslav bourgeois traitors and landlords.

    The victory of the Yugoslav revolution is the source of our ever-strengthening friendship and brotherly alliance with the Yugoslav Communist Party and the successful builders of socialism in Yugoslavia. (Applause)

    The method of the Czechoslovak revolution was different. Due to the favorable situation that formed after the war, the socialist revolution in Czechoslovakia was completed through peaceful means. The communists, who not only formed an alliance with the parties close to the working people but also with the bourgeois parties supporting the national unity front, seized power. The Czechoslovak people achieved victory on the path of peaceful revolutionary development.

    Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, and other people's democracies also achieved victory in the socialist revolution without going through a civil war, each in its own way.

    Thus, the course of history indisputably proves that the views of those Communist teachers who foresaw that the development of the revolution could take not only the path of armed uprising but also the path of peaceful means are correct.

    The brotherly Communist parties of the capitalist countries have an inexhaustible treasure trove of knowledge—the theory of Marxism-Leninism, a rich school of their own practical experience, and the lessons of historical victories of our country, China, and other people's democracies.

    There may be some poor theorists, pedants, and politically ignorant people who will ask: If the question is posed in this way, what is the difference between Marxists and reformists? Is this not a roll towards the path chosen by the Marxist revisionists?

    Reformists and revisionists, both past and present, have always tried to limit the struggle of the working class through minor reforms, minor concessions of capital to labor, to achieve only a slight improvement in the living conditions of workers under the capitalist system, but to maintain the unshakable rule of the capitalist system. They have always been and still are apologists for capitalism, not revolutionaries, but evolutionists, rejecting revolution, opposing the seizure of power by the working people, believing that if minor, minor "victories" are achieved, socialism can be reached after many years at some point. Perhaps some of them did not think so at all, but deceived the people in this way. (The hall is lively)

    Everyone knows that there have been cases where social parties have gained a majority in parliament, and there have been and still are social parties in government in some countries. But here, things are limited to individual concessions to workers, and no socialism has been built. The political leadership of society must pass into the hands of the working class, the working class must be prepared not only organizationally but also politically and economically to wage the struggle for socialism, the working class should not be satisfied with the leftovers from the capitalist table, but should seize the majority and take power into its own hands, abolish the private ownership of the basic means of production.

    Historical materialism teaches us that the replacement of capitalism by socialism, the replacement of a class society by a classless society, is a revolutionary leap. This transition essentially means the revolutionary replacement of one social system by another. Therefore, any transition from capitalism to socialism and any change in social relations is a revolution, with varying degrees of intensity, but all are revolutions of the peoples of various countries. The seizure of power by the people and the transformation of the ownership of the means of production from private to public is the greatest change in history.

    Therefore, the possibility of peaceful development of the revolution in individual countries should not be confused with reformism. It must be understood that the revolution, whether peaceful or non-peaceful, is always a revolution, while reformism is always ineffective and stagnant. Therefore, to achieve victory, the working class must relentlessly fight against reformism and the reformist illusions that arise within its ranks.

    Is war inevitable?

    The Central Committee's summary report on the inevitability of war and the question of the consolidation of two systems and peaceful coexistence is noteworthy.

    Everyone knows that Leninism proceeds from the following position:

    The essence of imperialism deeply contains the source of conflicts and wars between those countries that compete and struggle for markets, colonies. As long as imperialism exists, this tendency will exist, and the danger of war will exist.

    Under the current conditions, is it possible for a war to occur between imperialist countries or an imperialist country bloc? It is possible.

    The second question. Is there a danger of an attack by imperialist countries on socialist countries? Undoubtedly, there is. As long as socialism has not achieved a decisive advantage over capitalism on a global scale, this danger will continue to exist.

    Therefore, the question arises: Is a new war now predestined, in other words, is it possible to prevent war? The Central Committee's report clearly answers this question:

    Under the new conditions, Lenin's theory that as long as imperialism exists, the economic basis for war will also exist, remains valid. However, war is not predestined. This depends on certain historical conditions that characterize the current stage of development—the balance of forces in the world. These conditions arose and strengthened after the Second World War.

    Now, the countries that oppose war and advocate peace are the Soviet Union, People's China, and other people's democracies. They stand like mountains. This is an immense force that cannot be ignored. The peoples of Asia and Africa, who have freed themselves from colonial oppression, such as India, also oppose war and advocate peace. They have just freed themselves from foreign rule and naturally fear that a new war will bring back the shackles of colonialism. They hope to develop freely on their own, they do not need war, they need peace to ensure the path to prosperity. They are our allies in this cause, the cause of peace.

    In many European countries, such as France and Italy, there is a developed working class with immense influence among the people, advocating peace and opposing war.

    The workers, peasants, laboring people, a significant portion of the intelligentsia, and part of the bourgeoisie in all other countries do not want another war, they know the full destructive power of war, they have learned painful lessons from past wars. This is a serious and extremely important factor.

    However, there is also a huge imperialist monopoly capital in the United States, which has not suffered losses from war, but on the contrary, war has become a source of super-profits for them, they do not want to give up their war plans, although the American people are against war. In addition to public opinion and the powerful military force of socialist countries, there is another important new situation: atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs are not only possessed by Americans but also by the Soviet Union, and there are methods of transporting these bombs to any region of the world by air or rocket.

    In any war, there has not been a single foreign bomb, not a single foreign bullet falling on American soil, falling on American cities and factories, and it is also impossible, because there was no such technology and possibility. Now, however, this real possibility exists. When the United States launches an invasion, hydrogen bombs can also be dropped on American cities, and American imperialists cannot escape these bombs, their factories cannot escape either. For them, this time, war will certainly not be a source of wealth, from war they can only get destruction and annihilation.

    We believe that if anyone dares to throw hydrogen bombs or atomic bombs, then the best people in humanity will not allow civilization to be destroyed, they will immediately unite and tie up the aggressors, eliminate all wars, and at the same time eliminate capitalism. (Prolonged applause)

    The war of hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs can cause great destruction, but it cannot destroy humanity or human civilization, it can only destroy the decaying and harmful system—capitalism in its imperialist stage.

    The decisive means of ensuring lasting peace is disarmament, the elimination of hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs, and peaceful coexistence, which we are now and will continue to strive for.

    However, as long as the United States continues to oppose the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and as long as disarmament has not been achieved, we must maintain our armaments, including powerful, modern weapons based on the latest achievements of science and technology, at the proper level.

    The stronger the socialist camp, the greater the possibility of victory for the world peace movement and the impossibility of the aggressors daring to start a war.

    Therefore, in the Central Committee's summary report, it is said that war is not predestined. Now, history has entered such a stage that although the danger of war still exists, war may break out, but under the necessary conditions of the continuous struggle of the peoples of various countries against the danger of war and the vigilance against possible aggression, conditions and possibilities have arisen to prevent the outbreak of war and ensure not only lasting but also consolidated peace.

    Whenever the issue of long-term peace and long-term coexistence is raised, some people reasonably ask: How long will this long-term peace and long-term coexistence last?

    Our enemies interpret this as follows: we ultimately advocate war, as if we want to spread communism throughout the world through war, but, as they say, only because we are not yet prepared for this, we hope for peaceful coexistence for a certain period to be ready for the attack and to establish communism with weapons in hand. This is the "theory" used by our enemies to oppose us. This is a slander against our policy. Communism does not need war, it opposes war, does not wage war, the ideas of communism will also triumph. (Applause)

    The essence of our attitude towards war is not only the humanitarianism of the Soviet people and their friendly feelings towards the peoples of other countries. The interests of building communism and improving the living conditions of the people are directly at odds with the policy of expanding armaments and spending a huge amount of spiritual, human, and material resources on war purposes.

    The first decree issued by the Soviet government after the birth of the Soviet power was the peace decree. The leaders of the Soviet government, Lenin, tirelessly advocated peace and the establishment of diplomatic and trade relations with all countries.

    Lenin said: "Peace is the most precious to us..." (Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 32, p. 94) "The workers and peasants of Russia most value the interests of peace..." (Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 33, p. 125) "We strive without exception to form alliances with all countries." (Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 30, p. 341)

    Lenin said in February 1920: "Let the capitalists of America not disturb us, and we will not disturb them." (Lenin Collected Works, Vol. 30, p. 340)

    Lenin's words and testament about peace are sacred to us. We will repeat these words over and over again. (Applause) Our friends know these words. Let our enemies, those who obstruct the desire of the peoples of various countries to establish firm friendship with the Soviet people, also hear, estimate, and correctly understand these words.

    Peace is the guarantee of the shortest possible construction of communism in our country and in the countries that have already achieved victory in socialism. War can only delay the development of our economy, as happened during the Patriotic War. The ideas of communism will sooner or later open the way to the hearts of the peoples of various countries and will be established throughout the world.

    The correct Marxist-Leninist formulation of the question of war and peace in the Central Committee's summary report plays a historically significant role in further organizing the forces of society on a global scale to wage the struggle against war and for peace, and will greatly promote this noble cause of humanity. (Applause)

    Raising the level of ideological work

    I would also like to express some opinions on the issue of ideological work among our Communist Party members.

    Objectively speaking, the unsatisfactory situation in ideological work is partly due to the environment created for science and ideological work in the past few years. However, undoubtedly, the workers of the ideological front themselves must also bear some responsibility for our serious lag in this front.

    Unfortunately, in the past 15 to 20 years, we have done very little, extremely little, in using the treasure trove of Lenin's thoughts to understand and explain phenomena in domestic life and the international situation. This situation did not occur because Lenin's thoughts have become outdated or are no longer sufficient to explain the current situation.

    Leninism is the creative development of Marxism in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, and it retains and will continue to retain all its scientific theoretical and political power as well as practical significance.

    Lenin's brilliant statements about the laws of social development are a very valuable source for correctly understanding many phenomena today. Without Lenin, these phenomena cannot be understood, without Lenin, the current situation in the world cannot be understood, the laws of development of decaying capitalism in the era of imperialism cannot be understood, the fate and victory of the proletarian revolution and the path of building socialism and communism cannot be understood.

    Our party, its Central Committee, foreign Communist parties and workers' parties, relying on the eternally vital doctrine of Leninism, creatively apply this doctrine in analyzing specific events and phenomena of the current period of social development, thereby enriching Marxism-Leninism.

    In the summary report of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the current situation of capitalism is clearly analyzed. In the recent period, there has been a certain degree of increase in industrial production in capitalist countries. However, this increase has occurred under conditions of further sharpening of the contradictions of capitalist production and further aggravation of the instability of the capitalist economy. The capitalist economy is in a state of tension, it is pregnant with the outbreak of an economic crisis. The capitalist system is further weakening. In the world economy, the process of the decline in the share of capitalism and the increase in the share of socialism, which has global historical significance, is developing.

    We are all interested in the question of the current situation of capitalism: can capitalism in general still have development in the period of decay and general crisis? Is it possible for technological progress and increased production in capitalist countries today and tomorrow? The theory of absolute stagnation of capitalism is contrary to Marxism-Leninism. It cannot be assumed that the general crisis of capitalism will stop the growth of production and technological progress in capitalist countries.

    In "The Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Stalin analyzed the current situation of the capitalist economy, and there are some well-known points about the United States, Britain, and France, which may not be helpful to us, may not be correct. Stalin said that after the collapse of the world market, "the production volume of these countries will shrink." This point cannot explain the complex and contradictory phenomena of current capitalism and the fact of increased production in many countries after the war.

    As the Central Committee's report mentioned, Lenin, in his work on imperialism in 1916, brilliantly elucidated the laws of imperialism, pointing out: the decay of capitalism does not exclude the rapid increase of production, individual industrial sectors, individual countries in the era of imperialism, with varying degrees of intensity, sometimes manifesting one trend, sometimes another.

    All these facts show that it cannot be said that this part or that part of Lenin's principles has become outdated.

    At the same time, it must be noted that some other principles of "Economic Problems" need to be strictly studied so that our economists can deeply study and critically re-examine these principles from the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism.

    The historical process shows that all the principled principles of Marxism-Leninism have been confirmed unchanged in the current stage of imperialist development. However, there are few such common confirmations. We have the responsibility to specifically study: when, where, to what extent, and how this happened.

    We have seriously lagged behind in the study of contemporary capitalism, we have not deeply studied facts and figures, often limiting ourselves to: for propaganda and agitation, we extract some individual facts to illustrate the signs of the approaching crisis and the poverty of the working people, but we do not make a comprehensive and deep assessment of the phenomena that occur in foreign life. Our economists, when studying the economy of the Soviet Union and people's democracies, often remain superficial, do not delve to the bottom, do not conduct serious analysis and synthesis, avoid explaining the characteristics of the development of each country.

    Indeed, who among us seriously studies these issues? Before the war, we had a world economics and world politics research institute, but it has also been abolished, and in the system of the Academy of Sciences, the only economics research institute is not up to the task and cannot undertake the task of deeply studying the economies of socialist countries and capitalist countries. In the system of the Academy of Sciences, there is also an institute for the study of Eastern issues, but about this institute, it can only be said that the whole East has already awakened, while this institute is still sleeping today. (The hall is lively, laughter)

    Isn't it time to raise it to a level that meets the requirements of our times?

    It is difficult to understand why the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, which has existed for 139 years, was abolished, especially at a time when our contacts with the East are increasing and strengthening, when the interest of the Soviet public in Eastern countries and the need for personnel who understand the languages, economics, and culture of Eastern countries have increased immeasurably with the strengthening of economic, political, and cultural ties with them.

    It cannot be ignored that it is said that the United States has more than 15 scientific institutions studying the Soviet economy. I am not going to talk about what they study and how they conduct their research, but there is a fact that there are a large number of economists there collecting materials on the development of the Soviet economy and studying this development.

    It should be noted that the publication of the textbook on political economy and later the second revised edition of this textbook is a major achievement of our economists, but if we avoid talking about the need for further in-depth research and processing of the part about the current stage of the development of capitalism in the textbook, especially about the nature of cyclical crises and the issue of cycles, as well as the problems of socialist political economy, then it is not right.

    Everyone knows that Marx collected a large amount of statistical materials on the economies of various countries, including Russia, to make his brilliant conclusions. Everyone knows that Lenin spent enormous labor to find the then scarce but very important statistical materials on the economic development of countries to write the book on the development of Russian capitalism and to prepare to write the book on imperialism.

    If we do not carefully study all the statistical materials that we now have in abundance, more than at any other time and in any other country, do not systematize them, do not analyze and synthesize them, it is impossible to conduct any scientific economic work.

    Unfortunately, statistical materials are still waiting for Comrade Starovsky's Central Statistical Bureau to stamp seven seals. Economists have not yet been able to process these materials, and can only act as scholars, repeating old formulas and old materials. This is one of the reasons why we do not see the creative work of our economists. (Applause)

    We cannot ignore Lenin's statements about the significance of statistics. As early as the beginning of 1918, Lenin wrote:

    "Statistics in capitalist society is the work of 'officials' or a few experts—we must bring it to the masses, make it popular...".

    Unfortunately, now there is such an impression that even for some representatives of statisticians who still have remnants of the old society in their minds, Lenin's statement about "officials" is also fair. (The hall is lively)

    The Central Committee's report clearly talks about the unsatisfactory situation in our propaganda work. One of the main reasons is that we usually study Marxism-Leninism only according to the concise course of party history. Of course, this is wrong. The range of topics in our party history, especially the concise course, is limited and cannot include the rich thoughts of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, it is necessary to compile specialized theoretical textbooks for comrades of various levels. This is the first point. The second point, the existing concise course of party history, just in that it does not talk about almost all the events in the life of our party in the past 20 years, it already cannot meet our requirements. Is there any reason to defend ourselves for not compiling the history of the past 20 years?

    Another issue, the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is approaching, and we still do not have a simple or complete Marxist-Leninist textbook on the history of the October Revolution and the Soviet state, which reflects not only the positive aspects of the Soviet homeland but also the entire multifaceted life without embellishment. Can this be considered normal?

    A textbook that comprehensively expounds the birth and development of the first great socialist state in the world has immense theoretical and political significance. What great significance this has for our cadres and all progressive humanity! (Prolonged applause)

    The scientific work in the history of our party and Soviet society is probably the most backward link in our ideological work.

    Until recently, history books about large party organizations such as South Caucasus and Baku were still in use, and were even regarded as unquestionable models, which distorted facts, exaggerated the role of some people, while others were not mentioned at all. Minor events were elevated to an inappropriate height, while other more important events were not valued, reducing the leadership and command role of Lenin's Central Committee of the Bolsheviks before the revolution.

    So far, we do not have a truly Marxist work on the history of the Civil War period. Many published books have serious defects, have no scientific value, and some even have a counterproductive effect.

    Some historians, when explaining some complex and contradictory events of the Civil War from 1918 to 1920, do not explain them by the change in the balance of class forces in a specific period, but seem to be the result of the harmful activities of some individual leaders of the party at that time, who were wrongly regarded as enemies of the people many years after the events they wrote about.

    A historian from Moscow even said: if there were no Comrade Antonov-Ovseenko or Comrade Kosiore in the leadership of the Ukrainian party, there might not have been the Makhno gang and the Grigoriev gang, Petliura might not have succeeded in some periods, and might not have been infatuated with establishing communes (by the way, this was not only a phenomenon in Ukraine at that time, but a general phenomenon for the party), everyone sees, so Ukraine would immediately follow the path that the whole party and the whole country took after the implementation of the New Economic Policy.

    Such a historical record has nothing in common with Marxist history. This is more like the explanation of historical events by idealists and Social Revolutionaries. In my opinion, some Ukrainian historians write the history of the birth and development of the Ukrainian socialist state better than some Moscow historians, perhaps Moscow historians do not need to bother. (Laughter)

    A few words must also be said to our philosophers. And they themselves should understand that their situation is not good, they owe an even greater duty to the party than historians and economists.

    I would also like to say a few words about our jurists. It should be noted that Soviet jurisprudence, legislation, and judicial procedure in the early period of Soviet power, during Lenin's lifetime and for several years after his death, developed rapidly according to the Marxist-Leninist ideas, according to the foundations of proletarian socialist law correctly reflected in our party program. In the subsequent period, it was not the same, which caused the Central Committee of the CPSU to naturally worry and consider it necessary to urgently intervene in this matter to reverse the situation, starting from the necessity of implementing Lenin's socialist law. This was mentioned in the Central Committee's summary report.

    Our country has reached a very high level in the economy and politics. We are studying new, larger plans for economic upsurge.

    In our party, there are a large number of theoretically educated cadres, economists, historians, philosophers, jurists, and experts in the classics of Marxism-Leninism. However, these knowledge is rarely passed on, we do not feel the deep Marxist-Leninist creation here.

    Most of our theorists are only repeating and quoting old quotations, formulas, and arguments.

    What kind of science is it without creation? This is more like pedantry, doing exercises, rather than science, because science is first and foremost creation, the establishment of new things, not the repetition of old tunes. (Applause)

    Our scientific theorists must do their utmost to study the new facts in our reality, the new events and phenomena in the economic and social development of the Soviet Union and abroad, comprehensively study these facts and phenomena, explain them with Marxism-Leninism, and enrich the treasure trove of Marxist-Leninist thought.

    It should be expected that the 20th Congress of the Party will greatly promote the workers of the ideological front, they will truly undertake creative scientific work. The business here is endless, it is a business that is needed by the people, difficult, interesting, and glorious.

    Let the workers of the ideological front know that the party will not allow them to continue to lag behind life, economists, historians, philosophers, jurists should march in step with the party, with our life, they have the responsibility to eliminate the backwardness of scientific work, ensure the creative enrichment of Marxism-Leninism.

    Comrades! The summary report shows that in the period between the 19th Congress of the Party and the 20th Congress of the Party, the Central Committee, the entire Communist Party, and all the Soviet people have done a lot of work, fully demonstrating that we are on the correct path in the great cause of building communism.

    The Central Committee, relying on collective leadership and the unity of the Communist Party, boldly exposed the errors and shortcomings accumulated in the past years, and resolutely carried out the work of correcting and eliminating these errors and shortcomings in political activities, economic construction, cultural construction, and party building. The true Leninist feature of the work of our Central Committee lies in this.

    It is not an exaggeration to say that after Lenin's death, the 20th Congress of the Party is the most important congress in the history of our party. The spirit of Leninism and Leninism permeates all our work and all our resolutions, as if Lenin were alive and with us. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

    Everyone knows that before leaving us, Lenin was very concerned about the fate of our party and the revolution. He feared the split of the party and the split of the worker-peasant alliance. He sought ways to prevent the split of the party and the worker-peasant alliance. He was convinced that under the conditions of maintaining the unity of the party's ranks and the unity of the party's leadership, as well as in maintaining and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, the cause of communism is invincible.

    If now, 32 years later, Lenin could see the following scene, he would be very happy: now we have the organizational and political unity of the party's ranks and its leadership, the continuous development of Marxist-Leninist thought, the worker-peasant alliance is indestructible and consolidated, we not only swear by the name of Lenin, but also strive to realize the ideas of Leninism and sacredly execute his testament. (Stormy, prolonged applause)

    The 20th Congress of our Party, its resolutions, and the report of the Central Committee will receive a wide and enthusiastic response within the party, within the Soviet Union, and among all our friends abroad. The new grand tasks facing the party and the state will be realized. We have no doubt about this, our friends also believe this, let our enemies also give up their doubts.

    The guarantee of our advance to communism lies first of all in the fact that, as our immortal leader and teacher Lenin said: "We rely on the most wonderful force in the world—the force of workers and peasants." (Stormy, prolonged applause)

### 米高扬在苏共第二十次代表大会上的发言

第5版()
专栏：

    米高扬在苏共第二十次代表大会上的发言
    同志们！我完全同意党中央委员会的总结报告，现在我只想谈一下党中央委员会某些方面的工作。
    在中央委员会的报告中研究了人类现代历史上的一些新的情况和事件。中央委员会用马克思列宁主义的光辉阐明了这些情况和事件，对社会发展的规律以及它在现代条件下的利用作出了一些重要的、在理论上是大胆的和有深刻原则性的结论。适应现代情况的马克思主义理论的一些根本问题被提出来了。从这些问题中得出的结论不仅有理论价值，而且具有纲领的性质，对于在今后的发展阶段的正确的共产主义政策具有巨大的实际意义。这也就大大地丰富了马克思列宁主义，对马克思列宁主义关于社会发展的科学作出了宝贵的贡献。（掌声）
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中所包含的结论和论点说明，我们的中央委员会不是简单地重复大家都知道的那些马克思列宁主义的论点，作为历史经验最丰富的共产党的机构，这样做是应该的。中央委员会以强有力的马克思主义认识社会发展规律的方法为指南，来了解现代的社会发展事件，根据马克思主义解释这些事件，并且以这样一些结论来武装工人阶级，这些结论现在已经不只是概括和解释马克思和列宁生活和活动时期的事实和事件、而且还概括和解释随后无论在资本主义国家或者社会主义国家发生的事件。我想在下面谈谈所指出的问题中的某些问题，因为它们有极其巨大的重要性和现实性。
    标志着中央委员会及其主席团近三年来的工作的主要特征，是我们党内在一个长时期的间断之后建立了集体领导。（掌声）
    我们党现在有坚强团结的领导集体，它的力量不只在于它是由在革命斗争中多年协同工作的同志们所组成的，这当然很重要，但是主要的还在于，这个集体以列宁主义思想、列宁主义的党的建设和党的领导的原则为指南，在短期内使得从上到下恢复了党内生活的列宁主义准则。（掌声）
    集体领导的原则是无产阶级政党、列宁式的政党的根本原则，所以要强调这一本来就有的真理，是因为，大约在20年的时期内我们实际上没有集体领导，流行了曾经被马克思、后来又被列宁指责过的个人崇拜，当然，这一点不能够不对党内的状况和党的工作起极端不良的影响。而现在，当最近三年来在列宁式的原则性和列宁式的团结一致的基础上重新树立了共产党的集体领导的时候，就体会到列宁式的领导方法的一切有益的影响。最近几年来赋予我们党以新的力量的主要泉源也就在这里。这就是赫鲁晓夫同志报告中所叙述的那些成就的重要前提，也是党今后怀着更大的信心和更加胜利地沿着建设共产主义的道路前进的保证。（掌声）
    最近几年，在其他迫切紧要的问题中，中央委员会十分注意的是保证工业、首先是重工业的迅速发展，展开争取工业、运输业、农业，贸易各部门的技术进步的斗争和争取高度的劳动生产率和高质量的工业品的斗争。这一点在总结报告中也反映了出来。
    主要关怀的是消灭农业的落后现象和消除由此产生的工农业发展之间不均衡的现象，这种现象对我们国家有非常大的危害，如果它继续存在，那么就会十分严重地阻碍我们的发展。这个问题已经通过提高集体农庄庄员的物质利益和开垦荒地等一系列措施加以解决了。两年来已经开垦了3，300万公顷的新土地。难道我们以前什么时候能够幻想类似这样的事情吗？
    和这同时，在美国的农业中发生了什么事情呢？美国政府今年1月在总统的咨文中向国会提出了停止耕种播种面积达1，000万公顷的土地的计划。这是对农业生产力的直接破坏，是资本主义腐朽的新的极其明显的表现之一。原来，在美国也提出生荒地和熟荒地的问题，只不过是朝着相反的方向和按照美国的方式被提出来的。他们不开垦土地，反而把耕地变为熟荒地和生荒地（全场活跃）。这种事是发生在要攫取“世界领导权”的国家里，是发生在根据联合国的官方材料在资本主义世界有越来越多的人没有足够食品的时候，这批人达到了世界人口总数的59％，而在1939年还是31％。就在这个时候，在美国却提议破坏1，000万公顷的耕地。
    在对“世界领导权”的妄想的背后隐藏着什么东西，只要举这个例子就会明白：1955年美国和英国的石油垄断公司在近东开采了15，000万吨石油，总共耗费了24，000万美元，就是说难以置信的便宜。而他们依靠这批石油获得的纯利润达到了19亿美元，他们在一年内就捞回了在这一石油地区的整个投资，而在科威特，他们在一个季度内所得到的利润就等于整个时期在那里的投资数目。在美国，石油工业至少需要六、七年才能补偿投资。
    如果石油的全部收益都归它的合法主人——阿拉伯人和近东其他国家的人民所有的话，那么这些国家就能够迅速克服贫困，并且在经济和文化发展方面挽回由于外国资本多年来残酷无情的剥削而造成的损失。
    这个臭名昭彰的“世界领导权”还表现在发明种种新的隐蔽的剥削形式。亚洲和非洲很多国家已经摆脱了殖民地附属国地位，但是由于美国和英国的垄断资本的控制，在它们的对外市场上，它们，正如落后国家人民自己所说的那样，被迫接受不公正的价格，也就是一种特殊的出口价格和入口价格之间的“剪刀差”。由于这个缘故，比起本世纪开头那些年月来这些国家现在（根据联合国的材料）只能换回这些输出同等数量的货物，只能换回那个时候这些国家所能输入的货物的40％还要少。这就是所谓对落后国家的“关心”和“援助”！
    现在再回转来谈我们的农业发展的问题。应当说，我们农业状况的纠正，其次要原因在于下列几个方面：最重要的几种作物的播种面积作了合理的分配，农业工作全盘机械化，改组了农业的组织领导工作，改变了制定农业计划工作的安排。由中央制定计划的那种对事业有害的官僚主义的办法被取消了，把拟订播种面积和单位面积产量，牲畜头数和畜产品生产率的计划交给集体农庄自己去办，而留给中央管的只是规定缴纳和交售给国家的数量。
    所有这些措施保证了农业能够迅速高涨、我国经济中所发生的不平衡的现象能够消除，并且大大加强了工人阶级同农民的联盟。
    现在农业的产品生产率已经提高了，从而使食品和供居民消费的工业品的生产有显著的增加。
    已经提出任务要到第六个五年计划结束的时候使消费品的生产将近增加到战前1940年的三点五倍，其中肉和鱼增加到三点二倍，罐头增加到五点六倍，动物油增加到三点九倍——即将近四倍，糖增加到三倍，丝织品增加到十四倍，毛织品增加到三倍，缝纫机增加到二十二倍，钟表增加到十二倍。所以要用这样高的速度增加今天最感缺乏的日用必需品的生产，这是由于我们的党中央委员会注意到有些地方的贸易中存在着脱销和排队购买某些商品的现象。有时人们提出了这样的问题：贸易中的个别脱销现象和排队购买稀缺货物难道是不可以避免的吗？难道这些现象是伴随社会主义贸易而产生的吗？当然不是。当现有商品量和居民支付能力所及的需求量之间没有正确的平衡的时候，这些现象才会发生。
    在社会主义社会中，商品一定是求过于供的。日益增长的需求推动着商品生产的向前发展。整个问题就在于这个超过的程度。现有商品量和居民的货币收入之间的严重脱节会造成流通范围里的不协调，并且成为苏维埃贸易中的一种恶劣现象，结果就产生某些商品的排队和脱销现象，给居民造成不便，使贸易服务工作的质量变坏，给提高商品质量造成困难。
    现在我们有充分的可能来消除这种不平衡的现象。有了正确的计划，将来就可以在流通范围内不发生这种不平衡的现象，可以在五年计划的头几年内就消除在某些地方存在的、贸易中的排队和脱销现象。做到这一点，就一定可以为顾客创造必要的便利条件，可以提高贸易水平，可以改进对顾客的服务，可以保证把大量的商品的质量提高到国内外上等商品的水平，把整个贸易和公共饮食业提高到新的、符合于社会主义社会的要求的、更高的水平。（掌声）
    供求的正确关系将用下列办法求得：迅速提高稀缺货物的生产，今后要实行这样一种降低物价的政策，就是要根据增加商品量和提高居民购买力的情况来降低物价。
    应该坦率地承认，我们商店中和食堂中的营业情况比起外国的好的商店和食堂要差。必须承认这一点，为的是加紧努力，以便把贸易和公共饮食业的工作提高到相称的水平。同时，必须扩大商店和食堂网，因为我们的商店和食堂不够；必须在技术上重新装备它们；必须改进营业组织工作，在食堂中以及在商店中实行无人售货的办法。尽量使用自动机，现在美国约有200万部自动售货机在工作，而我们却很少。有了自动售货机，就可以使顾客方便，可以降低流通的费用，可以提高贸易工作人员的劳动生产率。
    为了根本改进商业和公共饮食业，必须完成使商业企业由地方分管的工作，把它们交给地方劳动人民代表苏维埃，广泛吸引职工中最积极的分子和家庭主妇来经常监督和改进贸易和公共饮食业。要不是他们，谁还会首先看到贸易中的全部缺点，进行检查和力求消除这些缺点呢。工会在监督方面应该起决定性作用，而地方苏维埃有责任消除已经揭露出来的缺点。
    我们中央委员会的活动的重要方面还在于：同官僚主义的集中化作无情的斗争，充分确立列宁主义的民主集中制；维护和加强苏维埃各民族的联盟和各加盟共和国的主权，把属于它们权限内的事务——这些事务早先集中在中央是不对的——交给它们处理，例如现在把中央所属的大量工业企业转交给地方机关管理；加强地方苏维埃和企业的权利，吸引工人群众广泛参加拟定和审查经济计划的工作、更加积极地参与决定生产管理的问题；精简国家机构，同给我们带来了许多害处的妄自尊大、高傲自得、浮夸不实、官样文章作斗争，不顾情面地充分开展批评和自我批评。
    在其他重大措施中应该指出把国家计划委员会分成为两个国家计划委员会——一个作远景计划，一个作当前的计划，目的是在将来的需要和今天的需要之间确立正确的联系，在这两个机构的互相监督之下好不让经济中出现不协调的现象。
    我们知道列宁是多么关心经济发展的计划性，可以相信，中央委员会在现今的条件下改组国家计划委员会的这一决定，是符合于列宁当时向国家计划委员会所提出的要求的。
    在资本主义世界里，经济的比例是通过竞争、生产的无政府状态和危机而自发地建立起来的。社会主义经济的比例和这不同，它是由有组织的社会的意志和以经济发展的客观规律的要求为基础的科学的计划建立起来的。因此，经济中发展的计划性和不容许有严重的不平衡的现象，取决于正确地和有科学根据地拟定计划的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告不仅仅是关于已经做过的事情的报告。提交代表大会讨论的中央委员会报告中和关于第六个五年计划的指示草案中，提出了一个伟大的和详尽的旨在加速向共产主义迈进的纲领。这个纲领谈到了工业和整个国民经济发展的途径，谈到了应该做什么事情，以便按照社会主义制度日益增长的可能性来保证进一步大大地提高人民的生活水平。
    我们一方面提出要使生产量在按照人口计算方面赶上和超过资本主义国家的任务，同时也提出要使消费量在按照人口计算方面赶上和超过最富裕的资本主义国家，以及使我国具有极其丰富的、应有尽有的各种消费品的任务。（掌声）
    还有许许多多极其重要的社会措施，例如，缩短工作日，提高收入低的工人和职员的工资，在教育子女和赡养年老的父母方面给予更多的帮助和优待，方法是：国家为老年人建立房屋和设置相应的养老金，免费教育，普遍设立托儿所和幼儿园，为学童组织寄宿生宿舍，办理学校的早点和广泛地建立公共食堂。最后，还有加速解决住宅问题和改善保健和国民教育事业的种种措施。
    提高低薪职工的工资意味着消灭我们经济中的某种不均衡现象，消灭我们在低薪职工和高薪职工工资中间所出现的过份悬殊的现象。当我们还是处在农民国家的时期，那时实行工业化，这种悬殊是很自然的，因为这样才能刺激迅速地形成高度熟练工人干部，国家当时极其需要这样的干部。
    现在，当有了高度熟练的、有高度文化水平的、每年都有从七年制学校和十年制学校毕业出来的人补充的工人阶级的时候，差别虽然还应该保持，但是将予以缩小，这是我们发展的新的水平的要求，这意味着在走向共产主义的道路上迈进一步。
    这一切都是共产主义的萌芽。它们打开了通向共产主义生活方式的道路。这一切使我们大家感到欢欣鼓舞。让那些以他们今天的财富、以他们的“美国生活方式”而夸耀，而自负的美国人也知道这一点，让他们来同我们在这一方面进行比赛吧，要叫他们相信：什么地方为人民的福利做的工作更多，什么地方的生活方式更好。让大家用这种比赛来代替军备竞赛。这种比赛是更合我们苏联人的心意的，也是更合美国人民的心意的！（掌声）
          外交政策的一些问题
    苏联的外交政策的成就是很显著的，特别是在最近一年中。党的领导集体在这方面也带来了新的清新的空气，实行了具有高度原则性的、积极的、灵活的、心平气和而不带谩骂的坚定的外交政策。这个政策是以各种社会制度不同的国家可以和平共处这个不可动摇的列宁遗训为出发点的，它的主要的目的是消除战争的威胁和保卫全世界的和平。
    当我们的外交政策过去犯了某种错误的时候，当在某种情形下由于我们的过错而使关系紧张起来的时候，我们的政府不怕对有关这样一些事实的国际问题公开加以说明，这使得很多资产阶级人士颇为吃惊。苏联政府坚决沿着消除我们在外交政策工作中的缺点的道路前进。解决苏联同南斯拉夫两国关系的问题就是人所共知的一个最明显的例子。当然，中央委员会在第十九次和第二十次两次党代表大会之间的时期内，在南斯拉夫问题上所采取的这种步骤，只有真正的列宁主义者才能够做得出的。现在可以清楚地看到，这些大胆的步骤是多么正确，这些步骤对于和平和社会主义事业的命运有多么大的成效。（掌声）
    还有其他一些措施：撤销我们在中国和芬兰的军事基地，取消在人民民主国家里的合营公司，同奥地利签订和约等等，这些都说明我们政策的大胆、它的原则性、尊重其他国家的主权，说明它的积极性以及随之而来的成效。
    正如马克思列宁主义所教导的，我们在拟定外交政策的时候，考虑到局势的具体的特征和实际的力量对比，正确地估计各个国家的政策在一定时期内，首先是在我们认为是主要的问题——争取和平的问题上带有的差别和色彩。这样，我们外交机关、对外贸易机关和经济机关对待外国和外国公民的一些生硬的工作方式就被抛弃了，苏联的社会团体和国家机关同外界隔绝的现象被消除了，苏联和外国的政府人士，政党的活动家以及社会团体之间的接触扩大了。
    在破坏国际联系这方面，大家都知道的美国侵略集团起了不良的作用。但是，他们企图嫁祸于人，把过错推卸在苏联人身上，他们编出了一套惯用的说法，说苏联挂起了“铁幕”。他们把这说成是“苏维埃制度的软弱”的标志，说成是我们惧怕在苏联人同外国人接触中可能产生的一切后果的标志。甚至还说成这样：这种接触会动摇我们的国家制度。
    我们很快就打破了这种神话，同外国在国家事务上和社会事务上，在艺术、旅行、运动等等方面展开了广泛的联系。
    我们同一些民主国家的这种接触发展得很好，而且有很大的进一步发展的前途。在同某些国家、譬如同美国，由于美国国务院不顾美国人民和美国许多社会团体的热烈希望而直接予以反对，事情是不顺利的。
    也可以举出这么一个可笑的例子。美国饭店业的代表去年来莫斯科作客，参观了名胜古迹，访问了他们所感兴趣的一切企业——饭店、食堂。我们甚至没有提出在互惠的条件下让我们的人访问美国的问题。美国客人很满意我们的好客，就直接邀请莫斯科饭店业的专家到他们那儿去，去参观美国公共饮食企业的工作。就这样开始了安排在这方面的接触。于是不久以前莫斯科公共饮食企业就有5个工作者打算到美国去，而国务院突然通知说，它认为他们的访问美国是不适宜的。（场内活跃，笑声）显然，对于国务院的有些人来说，甚至我们的炊事员和厨师也是危险的。（笑声，掌声）谁赞成接触，谁反对，在这件小事上任何人也都会明白。
    我们用自己的言论和事实来揭穿了国外敌对集团所散布的说苏联的政策有侵略性的谎言，并且彻底证实这一政策的爱好和平的性质。我们打破了说我们似乎害怕同外国人交往的愚蠢的臆造。
    甚至认为共产党人害怕同资本主义国家交往的这种想法也是可笑的。谁的社会制度好，是苏联的还是资本主义国家的呢？谁的思想高超，是我们的马克思列宁主义思想还是资本主义世界的思想呢？诚然，资本主义世界在法国革命时期有过自己伟大的理想，但是在自己日暮穷途的时候就没有先进思想了。旧理想过时了，而响往人类进步的新理想，在资本主义制度内现在没有、也不可能有，因为这是一个过时的制度，它已经在历史的辎重车上了。（场内活跃，掌声）
    西方自夸自己的自由和民主，这着实可笑。资产阶级民主怎么能够同无产阶级的、社会主义的民主比较，社会主义的民主是给人以完全和真正自由的全民的民主，而资产阶级民主却在表面的平等下确立和维护人对人的剥削。
    中央委员会的报告中完全正确地谈到了苏维埃社会主义的民主主义，它比任何的资产阶级民主主义都有无比的优越性。
    只有作为现代社会的主导力量的工人阶级，只有作为工人阶级的意识形态的体现者的共产党，才有而且才可能有唯一进步的理想。没有比马克思列宁主义更进步的思想了。（掌声）
    苏维埃社会主义国家孤立的时代，我们是资本主义包围中的一块绿洲的时代，已经过去了。现在根本没有这种问题了。现在，除了资本主义国家的体系以外，还有由永恒友谊的联系、共同的历史命运和保障世界和平的共同愿望联系起来的社会主义国家的体系。现在，如果不考虑苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家的意见，而仅仅考虑西方大国的意志，已经不能够解决任何一个重大的国际问题了。社会主义世界的伟大力量不仅在于，欧亚两洲拥有约10亿人口的13个国家已经建设社会主义，社会主义的力量还在于，在资本主义统治的许多国家里，社会主义思想已经掌握了广大的劳动人民群众以及人类的大多数。世界上的大部分人在社会主义的旗帜下，或者在建设社会主义（苏联已经建成社会主义），或者在争取建设社会主义的权利。
    100年前，马克思和恩格斯曾经说过：“一个怪影在欧洲游荡着——共产主义的怪影”。而现在，已经不是怪影，而是实在的共产主义，是千百万劳动人民可以具体地感觉到的亲切的东西，共产主义用坚定的步伐不仅在欧洲，而且在全世界势不可挡地大踏步前进，它的声名在震响着。（掌声）共产主义思想对现代整个人类社会生活的影响是不可估计地增长了。
    从对帝国主义和殖民主义作斗争、反对战争、反对战争威胁、争取国际和平、争取各国人民的自由和独立这一角度来看，可以大胆地说，全人类中的绝大多数是同我们站在一条战线上共同奋斗的。这就确定了全世界和平力量和战争力量的对比以及社会主义力量和资本主义力量的对比的根本变化。现在已经不能够仅仅因为许多富有的、军备优良的国家仍然是资本主义国家，而说资本主义强于社会主义了。在全人类的思想中，社会主义现在已经比资本主义强得不可比拟了。
    这就是为什么我们不怕社会主义思想和资本主义思想的斗争，这就是为什么我们党以及它的代表赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志在访问印度、缅甸、阿富汗期间，代表党如此大胆地唾弃殖民主义，并且公开地说，我们反对战争，而我们主张两种社会制度的竞赛，主张两种意识形态在和平共处的条件下进行斗争。
    在谈到共处问题的时候，有必要对国际贸易的问题表示一点意见。美国人醉心于自己的幻想，以为他们只要限制对社会主义国家的贸易，似乎就可以在某种程度上阻挠苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的发展。
    可是，现在甚至在西方也很少有人相信这一点了，因为大家看到，现在社会主义世界经济几乎在生产它本身需要的一切东西，而在主要商品方面，则可以满足社会主义阵营各国目前的需要。要证实这一点有这样一个例子：西方国家自从用对中国的禁运把自己的手脚捆了起来以后，就使得自己在中国的工业化这样一个重要问题上只好白瞪眼，而本来，这个问题是可能使它们中间的某些国家在不可避免的危机时期中不致于减缩生产的。
    我们坚定地认为，如果不进行贸易，巩固的和平共处是不可想像的，因为就是在两个世界市场形成以后，贸易也还是实行这种共处的良好基础。社会主义市场和资本主义市场这两个世界市场的存在不但不排斥世界各国之间发展互利的贸易，而且相反，为这种贸易提供了前提。从两个世界共处的角度看来，正确地理解这个问题既有原则性的意义，也有实际的经济意义。
    我们的出发点是，我们同资本主义国家进行贸易是对双方都有利的，并且有着进一步发展这种贸易的客观前提。这是社会分工的必要性决定的，是这样一个大家所知道的原理所决定的：并不是所有国家生产一切产品都同样有利的。在这个国家里生产这种产品更容易些，而在另外的国家中生产别的产品更容易些；各个部门的发展程度各有不同；工人阶级的习惯和生产传统等等对这都有影响。在这个意义上，国际贸易过去和现在都是合理的国际劳动分工的表现，这种作用甚至越来越增加了。
      关于社会主义革命在各个不同
        国家中和平发展的可能性
    同志们！在中央委员会的报告谈到的理论问题中，最尖锐和最主要的是这样一个问题：社会主义革命是不是不论在什么时候、在什么国家、在什么条件下，都必须通过武装起义的方式来实现呢，还是革命也有可能和平发展呢？
    认为社会主义革命永运同流血内战联系着这种流行的观点是不是正确呢？
    资本主义的思想家和宣传家把共产党员描绘成嗜血鬼，描绘成是一些随时随地都想使用暴力的人，是一些尽力要发动内战的人，单就这点来说，也可以看出上述问题的重要了。那些思想家和宣传家把这一切说成是无产阶级专政的必然主张，说成是为共产主义而斗争的不可避免的产儿。他们过去和现在一直企图根据这一点来对那些自发和自觉地倾向于社会主义思想的人民群众造成恐怖，引起人民的惊慌。
    我们对这些问题的观点是怎样的呢？赫鲁晓夫同志的报告对这些问题作了明确的答复。
    大家知道，在第一次世界大战以前，布尔什维克认为武装起
  义是革命在俄国取得胜利的道路。在第一次世界大战正炽烈的时候，布尔什维克提出了把帝国主义战争变为国内战争的口号。我们那时的立场是正确的，切身重要的。因为在当时，把帝国主义战争变为国内战争是制止世界大屠杀，是各国人民取得和平和自由的唯一手段。
    二月革命的结果，俄国的劳动人民获得了甚至在当时被称为最民主的国家——美国国内也不曾有过的民主自由。后来，列宁考虑已经变化了的局势，在著名的四月提纲中提出了工人阶级夺取政权，以及通过和平的方法、通过在苏维埃中争取多数的方法来完成社会主义革命的口号。
    直到1917年7月事件以后，即临时政府在彼得格勒大街上枪杀和平示威的工人的事件发生以后，和平发展革命的口号才取消了，因为局势起了变化。必须用暴力来对付准备发动科尔尼洛夫阴谋的资产阶级的暴力，必须通过起义来夺取政权。
    事实上，十月革命几乎是和平地完成的，因为在这以前，在苏维埃代表大会中和许多苏维埃中，大多数人已经是成为革命者了。这使得苏维埃不必通过严重的流血就能夺取到政权。
    十月革命以后，列宁和布尔什维克并没有号召进行国内战争和采用暴力。没有。党立刻拟定出和平发展俄国的道路。尤其是，列宁还号召同俄国和外国的资本家、同那些愿意在苏维埃政权监督下工作的人在经济方面达成协议。他建议给外国资本家承租权和设立国家资本主义型式的企业。
    那么，带给我们人民无穷苦难的国内战争是怎样开始的呢？
    全世界都知道，国内战争的发动者是帝国主义国家，流血的国内战争并不是革命发动的，而是反革命发动的，不是布尔什维克愿意进行的，而是违反我们的意志的。
    根据以上所谈到的，我们可以得出什么结论呢？列宁在什么时候、在什么情况下曾经是正确的呢？
    当他在第一次世界大战以前和战争时期号召进行武装起义和要求把帝国主义战争转变为国内战争的时候是正确的呢？还是当他在二月革命的最初几个月提出革命和平发展的口号的时候是正确的呢？还是当他在七月事件以后重新提出武装起义的口号的时候是正确的呢？
    他究竟在什么时候和在什么情况下是正确的呢？回答只能有一个——列宁在所有这些情况下都是正确的。
    列宁在任何情况下都不是以教条为出发点，也不是牢牢抓住失去了作用的口号，而是以不可能一成不变的生活要求为出发点。列宁正确地考虑到阶级力量实际的对比并且深刻地理解到这种对比的进一步发展的倾向，才提出当时的口号。马克思主义者应当这样做，而且只应当这样做，否则，口号就会变成妨碍无产阶级政党领导运动的死的教条。列宁对这种情况一直表现出不安，他曾经着重指出，“任何一个口号都有使自己过于硬化的可能。”（列宁全集第28卷第203页）
    我国的情况就是这样。马克思、恩格斯和列宁在这个问题上对其他国家的看法原则上也是这样的，他们一直强调，一切都取决于发展的时期、阶级力量的对比和具体环境。
    马克思在上一个世纪70年代的时候认为，欧洲任何真正人民革命的先决条件就是“粉碎官僚的军事的国家机器”。他把英国和大西洋彼岸的国家算作例外，那些国家的工人阶级当时有可能以和平方式、通过争得议会多数来获取政权。1872年马克思在阿姆斯特丹的群众大会上讲到夺取政权的问题，他说：
    “……我们从来没有断言说，达到这个目的方法一定得一模一样。
    我们知道，在有些国家里，不能不考虑到那里的制度、风俗和传统；同时我们也不否认，像美国、英国，（如果我更好地了解了你们国家的制度，那么我可能把荷兰也补充算在这些国家之内）这些地方的工人阶级可以用和平的方式达到自己的目的。
    不过即使这样，我们也必须承认，在大陆上大多数国家中，武力应该是我们革命的工具；为了最后建立劳动的统治，在一定时期我们要采取的就正是武力。”（马克思·恩格斯全集第1版第13卷第2部分第669页）
    马克思就是这样理解不同国家的革命的发展道路的。
    列宁在1917年写道，在垄断资本主义的新情况下，由于英国和美国的警察官僚机构的发展，马克思所说的这种特殊情况就不存在了。列宁尖锐地批评考茨基和其他叛徒，他们企图抓住马克思讲的上面那些话，企图提出“和平道路”作为一切国家和一切发展时期的原则，然而他们是按照自己的方式，按照改良主义的方式来理解和平道路的，他们并且企图使无产阶级脱离夺取政权的革命斗争。
    由此可见，夺取政权的方法在不同时期内，在不同的国际情况下，对不同的国家来说不可能是一模一样的。所有这一切都取决于阶级力量的具体对比，取决于工人阶级和它的敌人的组织程度，取决于工人阶级争取同盟者、首先是农民的能力。同时还应当考虑到各个国家的制度、风俗和传统。
    列宁在这方面曾经提请人们注意：“至于对变革底形式、方法和手段，马克思既没有束缚自己，也没有束缚社会主义革命将来的活动家，他极其卓越地了解到将来会有大批新的问题产生，在变革进程中整个环境会怎样发生变化，这种环境在变革进程中会怎样频繁而急剧地变动着。”（列宁全集第32卷第316页）
    这就是列宁的理解，这就是对无产阶级在革命斗争中的策略问题的列宁式的看法。
    马克思和列宁认为，历史的发展使事情成为这样：对绝大多数国家来说，武装起义是无产阶级夺取政权的规律和主要的道路，而他们认为，和平道路是一种对劳动人民有利的例外情况，他们从来没有忽视这种和平道路的可能性。列宁总是这样强调说“当然，工人阶级但愿和平地将政权夺到手中。”（列宁全集第4卷第254页）
    这里非常有必要指出，列宁认为，即使在无产阶级不得不采取武力的情况下，革命的主要的、经常的特点和革命胜利的条件仍然是组织和建设工作，而不是破坏工作。
    列宁在追悼斯维德洛夫的演说中说：“毫无疑问，没有这个特点——没有革命的暴力——无产阶级就不能胜利，但是也不能怀疑，革命的暴力只有在革命发展的一定时期，只有在一定的和特殊的条件下才是必要的和当然的革命方式，而这种革命的深刻得多的经常特性和革命取得胜利的条件，在过去一直是、现在仍旧是组织无产阶级群众，组织劳动人民。这样地把千百万劳动群众组织起来就是革命的最好的条件，就是革命胜利的最深的泉源”（列宁全集，第29卷70页）
    从列宁的时代到现在，世界局势发生了本质上的变化。这就使我们的中央委员会有可能根据同样的马克思列宁主义原则的立场以新的方式提出关于各国过渡到社会主义的形式的问题。
    国际局势发生根本变化的主要因素是，强大的社会主义阵营的产生、壮大和加强。在苏联已经建成了社会主义社会，伟大的中国和人民民主国家沿着社会主义建设的道路迅速迈进。世界社会主义体系建立了，巩固了，并且正在不断发展，而世界资本主义体系处在危机状态中，削弱了，不断地丧失着它的阵地。
    殖民主义制度在日益大规模地瓦解，在过去它是资本主义的重大后备力量。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和埃及的人民走上了自由发展的道路；亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的殖民地和附属国的所有人民正在竭力争取自由和完全的独立。
    资本主义国家工人阶级的组织性和阶级觉悟提高了。
    我们现在谈到现阶段中革命道路的问题的时候，正如马克思和列宁当年所作的那样，应当正确地考虑到每个国家内以及在全世界范围内阶级力量的对比。每个人都懂得，在我们这个时代里，没有一个国家能够孤立地发展而不受其他国家某种程度的影响。
    列宁早就预料到，在许多社会主义国家存在的情形下，小的资产阶级国家有可能通过和平的道路过渡到社会主义。列宁教导我们，不应当单单考虑某一个单独国家的阶级力量的对比，也应当考虑到社会主义已经在邻国获胜的事实。
    根据这些情况，中央委员会的总结报告得出结论说，在当前的条件下，个别国家存在着通过和平的道路过渡到社会主义的可能性。换句话说，由于国内阶级力量的对比和上面所讲的总的有利的形势，某些国家的工人阶级有可能在同农民结成联盟以后，把大多数人民团结在自己的领导下，通过和平的道路，即不通过武装起义，不通过国内战争，而利用现有的议会机关取得政权。当然，革命发展只有在工人阶级具有力量、具有组织性和阶级觉悟的条件下才有可能采取和平的道路。
    在另外的情形下，当资产阶级掌握着强大的军队和警察机器的时候，它为了保卫自己的统治，必然强迫无产阶级进行武装斗争。无产阶级对这种情况应当事前有所准备。
    为生活所证实的革命的马克思列宁主义的理论原理，令人确信中央委员会对问题的提法是正确的。列宁逝世后，社会主义革命已经在十多个国家取得了胜利。这是怎样发生的呢？
    举中国做例子。在这个伟大国家中，进行了几十年的国内战争。在那里，革命军队长期对外国帝国主义者和地主买办资产阶级反革命势力进行了艰苦的流血斗争。无产阶级和它的共产党在反封建和反帝国主义的革命的武装斗争中居领导地位，并且取得了这个斗争的胜利，保证了通过和平道路过渡到社会主义的改造可能性。
    列宁主义已经深入中国千千万万优秀人们的思想和心坎。列宁主义为中国人民指出走向社会主义的可靠的道路，列宁主义在中国土地上开花结果，并且为伟大的中国革命的经验丰富了。（掌声）
    我们祝中国共产党在这个伟大的东方国家中获得建设社会主义的完全胜利。（掌声）
    南斯拉夫革命的过程也是独特的。从法西斯德国向苏联发动战争的最初时刻起，南斯拉夫共产党就领导了反对法西斯枷锁的起义；南斯拉夫资产阶级的一部分流亡外国，远离同法西斯的斗争，另一部分同法西斯同流合污，成了占领制度的帮凶。因此，南斯拉夫反法西斯的游击战争同反对南斯拉夫卖国的资产阶级和地主的国内战争结合在一起了。
    南斯拉夫革命的胜利，是我们同南斯拉夫共产党和成功地建设社会主义的南斯拉夫人民的日益巩固的友谊和兄弟联盟的源泉。（掌声）
    捷克斯洛伐克进行革命的方式不同。由于在战后形成了有利的局势，捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义革命是通过和平方式完成的。不仅同和它接近的劳动人民的政党结成了联盟、而且同支持民族统一阵线的资产阶级政党结成了联盟的共产党人，掌握了政权。捷克斯洛伐克人民在革命和平发展的道路上取得了胜利。
    保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、波兰和其他人民民主国家也没有经过国内战争而各自以不同的方式取得了社会主义革命的胜利。
    可见，历史的进程确凿不移地证明了：曾经预见到革命的发展除了武装起义的道路以外也还有和平道路的那些共产主义导师的见解是正确的。
    资本主义国家的兄弟共产党有着取之不尽的知识宝库——马克思列宁主义的理论，有着自己丰富的实际经验的学校，还有着我国、中国和其他人民民主国家的历史胜利的教训。
    可能有那么一些可怜的理论家、书呆子和不懂政治的人，他们会问：既然这样提问题，马克思主义者和改良主义者有什么不同呢？这样是不是滚到马克思主义的修正主义者所选择的道路上去了呢？
    改良主义者和修正主义者过去和现在一直都力图用细枝末节的改革、用资本对劳动的细小让步来限制工人阶级的斗争，只要争取稍稍改善一下资本主义制度中工人的生活条件，然而要保持资本主义制度不可动摇的统治。他们过去和现在实质上都是资本主义的辩护者，他们不是革命家，而是进化论者，他们拒绝革命、反对劳动人民夺取政权，他们认为，只要能获得细小的、细枝末节的“胜利”，经过许多年后到某个时期就可以达到社会主义。可能，他们之中的某些人根本没有这样想，而是这样来欺骗人民。（全场活跃）
    大家都知道，有过某些社会党在议会中取得多数，有一些国家甚至有过而且现在还有社会党的政府。但是在这里，事情只限于个别的对工人的让步，而并没有建成任何社会主义。对社会的政治领导必须转入工人阶级的手里，工人阶级不仅要在组织上、而且要在政治上和经济上有进行争取社会主义的斗争的准备，工人阶级不应该满足于资本主义食桌上的残羹剩饭，而是要取得多数，把政权掌握在自己的手里，取消基本生产资料的私有制。
    历史唯物主义教导我们说，社会主义代替资本主义、没有阶级的社会代替阶级的社会是革命的跃进。这种过渡实质上就是一种社会制度革命式地代替另一种社会制度。因而，任何从资本主义到社会主义的过渡和社会关系的变革就是革命，激烈的程度有轻有重，然而都是各国人民进行的革命。人民夺取政权和生产资料所有制从私有制转变为公有制，就是历史上最大的变革。
    因而，不能够把个别国家的革命和平发展的可能性问题同改良主义混淆在一起。必须了解，革命不论是和平方式的或者是非和平方式的，终归是革命，而改良主义永远是没有效果的裹足不前。因而，为了获得胜利，工人阶级必须坚持不懈地同改良主义和在自己的队伍中所产生的改良主义幻想进行斗争。
        战争是不可避免的吗
    中央委员会的总结报告中关于战争不可避免性和关于两种制度的巩固的、和平共处问题的提法是值得注意的。
    大家知道，列宁主义是从这样一种立场出发的：
    帝国主义的实质中深深地包含着在那些进行竞争和争夺市场、争夺殖民地的国家之间发生冲突和战争的泉源。只要帝国主义存在，这种趋向将会存在，战争的危险性也将存在。
    在目前的条件下，帝国主义国家或者帝国主义国家集团之间的战争是否可能发生呢？可能的。
    第二个问题。帝国主义国家向社会主义国家发动进攻的危险性是否存在？毫无疑问，是存在的。只要社会主义还没有在世界范围内对资本主义取得压倒的优势，这种危险性将继续存在。
    于是就产生了这样的问题：现在，新战争是否是注定不可避免的呢，换句话说，是否能够防止战争呢？中央委员会的报告明确地回答了这个问题：
    在新的条件下，列宁认为只要帝国主义一天存在、引起战争的经济基础也将存在的理论，仍然是有效的。但是战争不是注定不可避免的。这取决于某些标志着当前发展阶段的世界上力量对比的历史条件。这种条件在第二次世界大战之后产生了，加强了。
    现在，反对战争、主张和平的有苏联、人民中国和其他人民民主国家。它们像高山一样地屹立着。这是不能不加以考虑的伟大力量。摆脱了殖民主义压迫的亚非两洲人民，像印度这样的国家也反对战争，主张和平。他们刚刚摆脱外国统治，理所当然地担心新战争会给它们把殖民主义的桎梏带回来。他们希望自力更生地自由发展，他们不需要战争，他们需要和平以保障走向繁荣的道路。他们是我们的这个事业上、即和平事业上的同盟者。
    在许多欧洲国家中，像法国和意大利，有着在人民当中有巨大影响的发达的工人阶级，它主张和平、反对战争。
    所有其他各国的工人、农民、劳动人民、很大一部分知识分子和一部分资产阶级不希望再有战争，他们知道战争的全部破坏力量，他们在过去的战争中领受过痛苦的经验教训。这是严重的和极其重要的因素。
    但是，还有像美国那样巨大的帝国主义垄断资本，战争没有使它们遭到损失，而相反地战争成了它们的超额利润的源泉，它们不愿意放弃战争的企图，虽然美国人民是反对战争的。使它们就范的除去舆论和社会主义国家强大的军事力量外，还有一种新的重要的情况，就是原子弹和氢弹不仅美国人有，而且苏联也有，还有用飞机或者火箭运输这些炸弹到世界任何一个地区的方法。
    在任何一次战争中，都没有一颗外国炸弹、没有一粒外国子弹落到美国土地上，落到美国的城市和工厂中，而且也是不可能的，因为没有这种技术和可能性。现在却有了这种现实的可能性。在美国发动侵略的时候，作为回击的氢弹也能够投掷到美国的城市上空，而美国帝国主义者也无法躲避这种炸弹，他们的工厂也同样无法躲避。对他们来讲，战争这次肯定地不是致富的源泉，从战争中他们只能得到毁坏和灭亡。
    我们认为，如果谁胆敢企图投掷氢弹或者原子弹，那么人类中的优秀分子将不让文明遭到毁灭，他们将立即团结起来，把侵略者捆起来，消灭各种战争，同时消灭资本主义。（经久不息的掌声）
    氢弹和原子弹的战争可以造成巨大的毁灭，但是，它不可能毁灭人类或者人类的文明，它只会毁灭腐朽的和有毒害的制度——发展到帝国主义阶段的资本主义。
    保障持久和平的决定性的办法就是裁军，消灭氢弹和原子弹以及和平共处，这是我们现在和将来都努力争取的。
    但是，只要美国还反对禁止原子武器和氢武器，只要裁军还没有能够实现，我们就不得不把自己的军备，包括以科学和技术的最新成就为基础的威力强大的、现代化的武器，保持在应有的水平上。
    社会主义阵营越强大，世界和平运动取得胜利和侵略者不敢发动战争的可能性就越大。
    所以在中央委员会的总结报告中说，战争并不是注定不可避免的。现在，历史进入了这样的阶段，虽然战争的危险性还继续存在，战争可能爆发，但是，在各国人民为争取和平、反对战争的危险性而不断斗争，在对可能发生的侵略保持警惕的必要条件下，已经产生了制止战争爆发和保证不仅是持久的和平、并且是巩固的和平的条件和可能性。
    每当讲到长期的和平和长期的共处的时候，有些人就会合理地提出这样的问题：这个长期的和平和长期的共处要延续到什么时候呢？
    我们的敌人这样来解释这一点，说我们归根到底是主张战争的，仿佛我们要通过战争把共产主义传播到全世界，但是，据他们说，只是因为我们暂时还没有为这个作好准备，才希望在一定时期内实行和平共处，以便一旦有了充分准备就实行进攻并且用手中的武器来建立共产主义。这就是敌人用来反对我们的“理论观念”。这是对我们的政策的一种诽谤。共产主义不需要战争，它反对战争，不进行战争，共产主义的思想也会胜利！（掌声）
    我们这种对待战争的态度的本质不仅仅是苏联人民的人道主义和他们对各国人民的友好感情。胜利地建设共产主义的利益和争取改善人民生活状况的利益，是同扩张军备政策和在精神上、人力和物力上耗费大量精力于战争目的这种做法直接矛盾的。
    苏维埃政权诞生后的第一个法令就是和平法令。苏维埃政府的领袖列宁不倦地倡议和平和同一切国家建立外交和贸易关系。
    列宁说过：“维护和平对我们来说是最珍贵的……”（列宁全集第32卷第94页）“俄国的工人和农民最珍视和平的利益……”（列宁全集第33卷第125页）“我们毫无例外地争取同一切国家结成联盟。”（列宁全集第30卷第341页）
    列宁在1920年2月曾经说过：“让美国的资本家不要打搅我们，我们也不打搅他们。”（列宁全集第30卷第340页）
    列宁所说的关于和平的话和遗训对于我们是神圣的。我们要一而再、再而三地重复这些话。（掌声）我们的朋友很清楚这些话。让我们的敌人，那些在阻挠各国人民实现同苏联人民建立巩固友谊的愿望的人们，也听到、估计到和正确地理解这些话。
    和平是我国和已经取得社会主义胜利的各国在最短期间内建成共产主义的保障。战争只能推迟我们经济的发展，就像卫国战争期间所发生的情况那样。共产主义的思想迟早会开辟出到达各国人民内心的道路，并且在全世界范围内树立起来。
    中央委员会的总结报告中就战争和和平问题所作的正确的马克思列宁主义的提法，对进一步组织社会力量在全世界范围内开展反对战争和争取和平的斗争方面起着具有历史意义的作用，将大大地促进这个人类崇高事业。（掌声）
    把思想方面的工作提高到新的水平
    我还想对我们共产党员的思想工作问题发表一些意见。
    客观地说，在思想工作方面不能令人满意的状况，一部分是由于以往若干年中对科学和思想工作所造成的环境。但是，毫无疑问，思想战线上的工作人员本身也应当对我们在这个战线上严重的落后状态负一定的责任。
    遗憾得很，在最近的15年到20年中，我们在运用列宁思想的宝库来理解和解释国内生活现象和国际局势现象方面的工作做得很少，非常少。这种情况的发生，自然不是因为列宁的思想已经过时了，或者是不足以说明当前的局势了。
    列宁主义是马克思主义在帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的创造性的发展，它保持着、并且将继续保持它的全部科学理论和政治力量以及实践的意义。
    列宁关于社会发展的规律的天才的说法，是正确理解当前许多现象的非常宝贵的泉源。如果没有列宁，就不能理解这些现象，如果没有列宁，就不能理解世界上当前的情况，不能理解腐朽的资本主义在帝国主义时代发展的规律性，不能理解无产阶级革命的命运和它的胜利以及社会主义和共产主义建设的道路。
    我们的党、它的中央委员会、外国共产党和工人党，依靠着永远充满活力的列宁主义学说，在分析当前社会发展时期的具体事件和现象方面创造性地应用着这种学说，从而丰富着马克思列宁主义。
    在苏联共产党中央委员会的总结报告中，明确地分析了资本主义当前的情况。在最近时期内，资本主义国家的工业生产有了某种程度的上升。但是，这种上升是在资本主义生产的矛盾进一步尖锐化和资本主义经济的不稳定进一步加剧的情况下产生的。资本主义经济处在紧张的状况中，它孕育着经济危机的爆发。资本主义制度正在进一步削弱。在世界经济中，资本主义的比重下降和社会主义比重上升这种具有全世界历史意义的过程正在发展。
    我们大家都不能不对资本主义当前的情况这个问题感到兴趣，这个问题就是：资本主义在腐朽和总危机的时期中一般说来是否还能有发展呢？在今天和明天，资本主义国家的技术进步和生产增加是否还有可能呢？资本主义绝对停滞的理论是同马克思列宁主义背道而驰的。不能够认为，资本主义的总危机就会使得资本主义国家的生产增长和技术进步停止下来。
    斯大林在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中分析当前的资本主义经济的情况的时候，有一些关于美国、英国和法国的大家知道的论点，这些论点未必能对我们有所帮助，未必是正确的。斯大林说，在世界市场瓦解以后，“这些国家的生产量将会缩小”。这种论点并不能解释当前的资本主义的复杂和矛盾的现象和战后许多国家的资本主义生产增加的事实。
    正如中央委员会的报告所讲到的，列宁1916年在他的论述帝国主义的著作中，天才地阐明了帝国主义的规律性，他指出：资本主义的腐朽并不排除生产的迅速增加，个别工业部门、个别国家在帝国主义时代，各以多少不一的强度，时而表现着这一种趋向，时而又表现着另一种趋向。
    所有这些事实说明，不能认为列宁这些原理的这一部分或者那一部分已经过时了。
    同时，不能不指出，“经济问题”的某些其他原理还有必要加以严格的研究，以便使我们的经济学家能够从马克思列宁主义的观点深刻地研究和批判式地重新考虑这些原理。
    历史过程说明，马克思列宁主义的所有原则性的原理在帝国主义发展的现阶段上也得到了不变的证实。但是，很少有这种共同的证实。我们有责任具体地研究：这是在什么时候，什么地方，什么程度上和怎样发生的。
    我们在研究现阶段的资本主义方面严重地落后了，我们没有深刻研究事实和数字，常常局限在：为了宣传鼓动而摘录一些个别事实来说明危机日益临近的迹象和劳动人民的贫困，但是，对外国生活中所发生的现象没有做全面和深刻的估计。我们的经济学家在研究苏联和人民民主国家的经济的时候常常浮于表面，没有深入到底，没有做到认真的分析和综合，避开阐明各个国家发展的特点。
    的确，实际上我们有谁在认真研究这些问题呢？战前，我们有一个世界经济和世界政治研究所，可是连它也已经被撤销了，而在科学院的系统中唯一的一个经济研究所是担负不起的而且也不可能担当起深刻地研究社会主义国家和资本国家经济的事情的。在科学院系统中还有一个研究东方问题的研究所，但是关于这个研究所只能够这样说，现在整个东方都已经觉醒了，而这个研究所到今天还在睡觉。（大厅中活跃，笑声）
    现在难道不是到了应当把它提高到符合我们时代要求的水平的时候了吗？
    很难理解为什么要取消存在了139年的莫斯科东方学研究所，特别恰恰是在我们同东方的联系日益增多和日益加强的时候，是在苏联公众对东方国家的兴趣和对懂得东方国家的语言、经济和文化的人材的需要随着同它们之间的经济、政治和文化联系的加强而无比地提高了的时候。
    不能不注意到这样一个事实：据说美国有15个以上的科学机关在研究苏联的经济。我不准备谈它们研究的是什么和怎样进行研究，但是，那里有大量的经济学家在收集苏联经济发展的材料和研究这种发展，这是一个事实。
    应当指出，政治经济学教科书的出版以及后来这本教科书的第二版增订本的出版，是我国经济学家的重大成就，但是，如果对教科书中关于资本主义发展的现阶段的部分，特别是关于周期性危机的性质和周期性的问题，以及社会主义政治经济学问题，还需要进一步更深入的研究和加工这一点避而不谈，那就不对了。
    大家知道，马克思为了作出自己天才的结论，曾经收集了许多关于世界各国、其中包括俄国的经济的统计材料。大家知道，列宁为了写作关于俄国资本主义的发展的书和准备写作关于帝国主义的书，曾经花了多么巨大的劳动来寻找当时是贫乏的然而是非常重要的有关国家经济发展的重要统计材料。
    如果不仔细研究我们现在所大量拥有的、比任何时候和任何国家都要丰富的全部统计材料，不使它们系统化，不加以分析和综合，就不可能进行任何科学的经济工作。
    遗憾得很，统计材料仍旧在等待斯塔罗夫斯基同志的中央统计局盖七个图章。经济学家还没有可能对这些材料进行加工，而只有充当学究，重复一些旧的公式、旧的材料。这是看不到我们的经济学家的创造性工作的原因之一。（掌声）
    不能忽视列宁关于统计的意义的说法。列宁早在1918年年初就写道：
    “统计在资本主义社会里是‘官方人士’或者少数专家们专门进行的工作，——我们应当把它带到群众中去，使它大众化……”。
    遗憾得很，现在使人有这样一种印象，就是在现在，列宁关于“官方人士”的说法对头脑中还有旧社会的这种残余的某些统计学家的代表人物来说也是公正的。（全场活跃）
    中央委员会的报告中，清楚地谈到我们的宣传工作中的不能令人满意的情况。其中主要原因之一是，我们照例只是根据党史简明教程来研究马克思列宁主义。这样做当然是不对的。我们的党史，特别是它的简明教程的论题的有限范围，是不能包括丰富的马克思列宁主义思想的。为此，就要求为各种水平的同志编纂专门的理论教科书。这是第一点。第二点，现有的党史简明教程，光就其中没有谈到差不多最近20年来的我们党的生活中的事件这点来说，就已经不能满足我们的要求了。难道有什么理由可以为我们没有编纂最近20年的历史这件事辩解吗？
    还有，如果我们的历史学家认真地，深刻地研究苏维埃时期我们党的历史中的事实和事件以及“简明教程”中谈论的问题，如果他们好好地找一找档案和历史文件，而不只是翻翻报纸合订本，那末他们现在就能够从列宁主义的立场更好地阐明“简明教程”中所叙述的许多事实和事件了。
    另一个问题，十月革命将近过去了40年，我们还没有一本简单的或者是完整的关于十月革命和苏维埃国家的历史的马克思列宁主义的教科书，不加粉饰地反映出不仅是苏维埃祖国的正面，而且是全部多方面的生活。这种情况能认为是正常的吗？
    一本全面阐述世界上第一个伟大的社会主义国家的产生和发展的教科书，在理论上和政治上该有多么巨大的意义。这对我国的干部和全世界的进步人类又有着怎样的意义啊！（经久不息的掌声）
    在我党的历史和苏维埃社会的历史方面的科学工作，大概是我们思想工作中最落后的一环。
    一直到不久以前，关于南高加索和巴库这些大的党组织的历史书还在通用，甚至还被当作无可争辩的范本，这些书歪曲了事实，有些人的作用被任意夸大，而另外一些人就根本没有提到。次要的事件被提到不应有的高度，而其他一些更重要的事件却没有被重视，降低了布尔什维克党革命前的列宁的中央委员会的领导作用和指挥作用。
    到目前为止，我们也没有关于内战时期的真正的马克思主义的著作。许多已经出版的书籍有很大的缺点，没有科学价值，而其中有的甚至会起反作用。
    某些历史学家在说明1918到1920年国内战争的一些复杂而矛盾的事件的时候，不是用特定的时期内阶级力量对比的变化来解释，而认为那似乎是当时党的一些个别领导人的有害的活动的结果，这些领导人在所写的事件过去了很多年之后仍然被错误地当作人民的敌人。
    莫斯科的一个历史学家甚至这样说：如果乌克兰党的领导人中没有安托诺夫—奥弗申科同志或是科西奥尔同志，可能就不会有马赫诺匪帮和格里戈里耶夫匪帮，彼特留拉就不会在某些时期中获得成功，就不会醉心于树立公社（顺便说一句，当时不仅乌克兰有这种现象，而且对党来说是一个普遍的现象），大家看，这样乌克兰马上就会走上全党和全国在执行新经济政策之后所转上的路线了。
    这种历史的记载同马克思主义的历史是毫无共同之处的。这倒像唯心主义者和社会革命党人对历史事件的解释。依我看，有的乌克兰历史学家写乌克兰社会主义国家的诞生和发展的历史，会比某些莫斯科的历史学家写得好，也许，莫斯科的历史学家是根本不必代劳的。（笑声）
    还得向我们的哲学家说两句话。而他们自己也应该明白，他们的情况并不好，比起历史学家和经济学家来，他们甚至对党负有更大的义务。
    我也想谈一下我们的法律学家。应该指出，苏联的法律学、立法和诉讼准则在苏维埃政权成立的初期，在列宁在世的时候和他逝世后的若干年代中，是按照马克思列宁主义的思想、按照在我们党纲中正确反映出来的无产阶级社会主义法制的基础得到了迅速发展的。在以后的时期就不是这样，这就引起了苏联共产党中央委员会的理所当然的担心，苏联共产党中央委员会认为必须刻不容缓地干预这件事以扭转局面，其出发点就是必须贯彻列宁的社会主义法制。在中央委员会的总结报告中提到了这一点。
    我们国家在经济上和政治上已经达到了很高的高度。我们正在研究新的、更大的经济高涨的计划。
    在我们党内，有着大量的有理论修养的干部、经济学家、历史学家、哲学家、法学家、精通马克思列宁主义经典著作的人。但是，这些知识极少传授，我们这里感觉不到有深刻的马克思列宁主义的创作。
    我们的大多数理论家都是重复和翻来复去地引用老的引语、公式和论点。
    缺乏创造的科学还成什么科学呢？这宁可说是学究气、作习题，而不是科学，因为科学首先是创造，是创立新的，而不是重弹老调。（掌声）
    我们的科学理论工作者必须尽全力来研究我们的现实情况中的新事实、苏联和国外经济和社会发展方面的新事件和现象，全面研究这些事实和现象，用马克思列宁主义来阐明它们，从而丰富马克思列宁主义的思想宝库。
    应该指望，党的第二十次代表大会将大大推动思想战线的工作者，他们将真正担当起创造性的科学工作。这里的事业是无穷尽的，是人民所需要的、困难的、有趣味的和光荣的事业。
    让思想战线上的工作者们知道，党不能容许他们继续落后于生活，经济学家、历史学家、哲学家、法学家应该同党、同我们的生活一起齐步前进，他们有责任消除科学工作的落后现象，保证创造性地丰富马克思列宁主义。
    同志们！总结报告说明，在党的第十九次代表大会和第二十次代表大会之间的时期中，中央委员会、整个共产党和我们全体苏联人民做了很多工作，充分说明我们在共产主义建设的伟大事业中走着正确的道路。
    中央委员会依靠集体领导和共产党的团结一致，大胆地揭露了在过去年代中累积的错误和缺点，在政治活动、经济建设、文化建设和党的建设的各个方面坚决地进行纠正和消除这些错误和缺点的工作。我们的中央委员会的工作的真正列宁主义的特点就在于此。
    不夸张地说，在列宁逝世以后，党的第二十次代表大会是我们党史上最重要的代表大会。列宁主义的精神和列宁主义贯穿到我们的一切工作和我们的一切决议中，好像列宁活着以及同我们在一起一样。（暴风雨般的，经久不息的掌声）
    大家知道，列宁在离开我们以前，十分关心我们的党和革命的命运。他最怕党的分裂和工农联盟的分裂。他努力寻求方法来防止党的分裂和工农联盟的分裂。他坚信，在保持党的队伍的团结和党的领导的团结以及在维护和加强工农联盟的情况下，共产主义的事业是不可战胜的。
    如果现在，在32年以后，列宁能够看到下面这种情景该是多么高兴啊：现在我们有党的队伍和它的领导的组织团结和政治团结，马克思列宁主义的思想不断发展，工人阶级和集体农民的联盟是牢不可破的和巩固的，我们不但以列宁的名字宣誓，而且在全力实现列宁主义的思想和神圣地执行他的遗训。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    我们党的第二十次代表大会、它的决议和中央委员会的报告，在党内、苏联国内以及在国外的所有我们的朋友中间，将得到广泛的和热烈的反应。党和国家面临的新的宏伟的任务将被实现。我们对这点没有丝毫的怀疑，我们的朋友也深信这一点，让我们的敌人也放弃他们的怀疑吧。
    我们向共产主义迈进的保证首先在于，正像我们不朽的领袖和导师列宁所说的：“我们依靠世界上最奇妙的力量——工人和农民的力量。”（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
