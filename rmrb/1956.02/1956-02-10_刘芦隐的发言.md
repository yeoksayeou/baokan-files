Chairman, fellow committee members:

I am participating in this plenary meeting with infinite joy and excitement. I wholeheartedly endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and fully agree with the reports made by Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, and Committee Member Chen Boda.

In Chairman Zhou's most policy-oriented and summarizing report, when mentioning the issue of intellectuals, he said: "Helping intellectuals to carry out self-transformation is of extremely significant importance for fully mobilizing and leveraging the strength of intellectuals." I will now give a brief speech on my personal experience and understanding gained in carrying out self-transformation under the cultivation and help of the Party in recent years.

I was a failed element who participated in the bourgeois democratic revolution, and a failed element who participated in the anti-Chiang movement and was imprisoned for 12 years by Chiang's secret agents, only to be released a year before liberation. However, shortly after the victory of the liberation struggle, I was attracted by the correct policy implemented by the Party for the unity, education, and transformation of intellectuals, and was able to go to the Southwest Revolutionary University in Chongqing for study. Through ten months of study, I initially recognized the truth of Marxism-Leninism and the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought, and thus used the weapons of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to dig out the roots of the theoretical errors of the bourgeois democratic revolution. I understood the reasons why the bourgeois revolution could not succeed in the past, examined my crimes of acting as a spokesman for Chiang Kai-shek in anti-communist and anti-people activities before the anti-Chiang movement, and realized the truth that anti-Chiang does not equal revolution, and deeply regretted that my past half-life of revolution had taken a detour. During the ten months of education, I not only personally experienced the Party's leniency towards me, but also deeply felt the warmth of the Party's revolutionary ranks.

After graduating from Southwest Revolutionary University, I returned to Chengdu. Soon, the Party again cared for me and trusted me, giving me a job at the Sichuan Research Institute of Culture and History, and allowing me to participate in leading the study of some researchers. Over the years, this has enabled me to continuously improve and progress in my ideological understanding and work. However, I have checked that I still have many shortcomings, such as not having a deep enough understanding of my colleagues, not providing enough care, and not providing timely assistance, thus hindering the development of my colleagues' potential strength to varying degrees. After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's report, I know that the Party and the government have a clear policy of overall planning and strengthening leadership for the issue of intellectuals. Under the illumination of this clear policy, I must redouble my efforts to improve my professional level, intensify my self-transformation, and constantly check myself, overcome all shortcomings in my work, so that every colleague can play their due role in the cause of socialist construction.

Because the Party was concerned that my revolutionary practice was insufficient, in May of last year, I was allowed to participate in assisting in expanding the joint state-private operation of the capitalist salt industry in Zigong City. By August, with the successful completion of the preparations for the joint state-private operation, I and my colleagues who worked together successfully completed our assistance tasks. I gained a lot from this three months of practical work. The main thing is: I realized the necessity and possibility of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, realized the correctness of the Party and government's policies and decrees, realized the meticulous and thorough implementation of policies and decrees by cadres, realized the noble qualities of the working masses with organization, discipline, and selflessness, and realized that the ideological transformation of capitalists is a complex, sharp, and long-term class struggle. In particular, I realized that the entire socialist transformation work must closely rely on the leadership of the Party and the opinions of the working masses in order to ensure the success of the work. However, I also made many mistakes in these few months of work, mainly sympathizing with the capitalists without realizing it. After the leadership's kind concern and pointing out, I was corrected in time. In order to prevent my colleagues from making the same mistakes, I took the initiative to convene a meeting and launched criticism and self-criticism. Through several months of work, I deeply received a socialist practical education, and I took a big step closer to the Party in my thinking and feelings.

The above shows how the Party fully helps intellectuals to transform themselves, and I am a living proof of this.

At present, the issue of transforming and cultivating intellectuals is not limited to a element like me, but involves intellectuals nationwide. The call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee is not only to make the strength of intellectuals across the country, in terms of quantity, professional ability, and political awareness, able to meet the needs of the rapid development of national construction, but also to be able to quickly catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels. In order to achieve this great goal, the Central Committee has made a decision to conduct overall planning and strengthen leadership. As Vice Chairman Guo Moruo said in his report: "The Party and the government have deep concern and expectations for intellectuals. After the Party and the government have successively brought the agricultural cooperation, handicraft cooperation, and the joint state-private operation of the entire private industrial and commercial sectors to a climax, conducting overall planning and strengthening leadership for scientific and cultural undertakings will have a significant role in promoting the rapid arrival of a climax in cultural construction as well." I hope that intellectuals across the country will increasingly closely unite around the Communist Party, strengthen their efforts, and do their best to promote the early arrival of this climax!

    刘芦隐的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我以无限愉快和兴奋的心情参加这次的全体会议。我衷心拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，并完全同意李济深副主席、郭沫若副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武副主席和陈伯达委员所作的各项报告。
    在周主席的最有政策性和总结性的报告中，提到知识分子问题时，曾这样说：“帮助知识分子进行自我改造，对于充分动员和发挥知识分子力量，具有极其重大的意义”。我现在就我个人这几年来在党的培养和帮助下，进行自我改造所得的经验和体会，来作一个简括的发言。
    我过去是参加资产阶级民主革命的失败分子，而且是参加反蒋而被蒋的特务监禁了12年的失败分子，直到解放前一年才被释放出来的。但在解放斗争胜利不久之后，我就为党所执行的对于知识分子团结、教育和改造的正确政策所吸引，能够到重庆的西南革命大学去进行学习。通过十个月的学习，我初步认识到马克思列宁主义的真理和毛泽东思想的正确性，从而以辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义这武器，挖出了资产阶级民主革命理论错误的根子，明白了过去资产阶级革命所以不能成功的原因，检讨了我自己在反蒋以前为蒋介石作了反共反人民的代言人的罪行，并且体会了反蒋不等于革命的道理，而深自痛悔我过去的半生革命都走了弯路。在十个月的教育当中，我不仅亲身体验到党的对我宽大，而且亲切感受到党的革命队伍里的温暖。
    我从西南革命大学结业后回到成都，不久，党又关怀我，信任我，给我在四川文史研究馆工作，并参加领导一部分研究员的学习；几年以来，使我在思想认识上和工作上不断地有所提高和进展。但是我检查自己的缺点还很多，如对于同学们的了解不够深入，照顾不够周到，帮助不够及时，因而在不同程度上妨碍了同学们的潜在力量的发挥。这次听了周恩来主席的报告，知道党和政府对于知识分子问题已有全面规划、加强领导的明确方针。在这一个明确方针照耀之下，我一定要加倍努力，提高我的业务水平，加紧我的自我改造，同时，还要不断地检查自己，克服工作上的一切缺点，使每一个同学都能发挥他对社会主义建设事业的应有作用。
    由于党关怀到我的革命实践过分不足，去年5月让我参加了协助扩展自贡市资本主义盐业公私合营工作，到8月间，随着公私合营筹备工作的胜利完成，而让我和共同工作的同志们顺利的完成了我们的协助任务。我在这3个月的实际工作中，收获很大。主要的是：认识了资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的必要性和可能性，认识了党和政府的政策法令的正确，认识了干部执行政策法令的细致彻底，认识了工人群众有组织、有纪律和大公无私的高贵品质，认识了资本家思想改造是一项复杂、尖锐和长期阶级斗争的工作，特别是认识了整个社会主义改造工作，必须紧密依靠党的领导和工人群众的意见，才是搞好工作的保证。但是我在这几个月工作中还犯了不少的错误，主要是同情资本家而不自知，经领导上亲切地关怀指出，及时得到了纠正。为了使共同工作的同志们不致犯同样的错误，我主动地召集会议，展开了批评和自我批评。通过了几个月的工作，使我深深受到了一次社会主义的实践教育，我在思想上和感情上更向党靠拢了一大步。
    以上就是说明党是如何充分帮助知识分子自我改造，而对我就是一个活生生的证明。
    目前，改造和培养知识分子的问题，不是限于像我这样一个分子，而是全国范围内的知识分子，毛主席和党中央的号召，不仅是要全国知识分子的力量，在数量上、业务能力上、政治觉悟上，都能适应国家建设急速发展的需要，而且要能迅速赶上世界科学先进的水平。为了达到这一伟大的目标，中央已经作出了决定，进行全面规划，加强领导。正如郭沫若副主席的报告中所说：“党和政府对于知识分子有着深切的关怀和期待。党和政府在促成了农业合作化、手工业合作化、私营工商业全行业公私合营连续地达到高潮之后，对于科学文化事业进行全面规划和加强领导，这在促使文化建设也迅速地达到高潮上，是有重大作用的。”我希望全国知识分子日益紧密地团结在共产党的周围，加强自己的努力，尽可能地促成这一个高潮早一天到来！
