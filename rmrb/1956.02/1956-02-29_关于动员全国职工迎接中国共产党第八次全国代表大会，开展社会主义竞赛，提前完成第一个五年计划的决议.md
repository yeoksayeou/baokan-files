Resolution on Mobilizing National Workers to Greet the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Launch a Socialist Emulation Drive, and Complete the First Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule

I

Since the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, a high tide of agricultural and handicraft cooperation and the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises has been launched throughout the country. The rapid development of the socialist economy has promoted the high tide of the socialist transformation movement in urban and rural areas. This high tide is now, in turn, exerting an extremely strong driving force on socialist industrial construction, demanding that socialist industrial construction advance more rapidly. In order to adapt to this new high tide situation, the Party Central Committee calls on us to do more, faster, better, and more economically, and strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions resolved to mobilize workers across the country to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, comprehensively launch a socialist emulation drive, strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and use such practical actions as a gift to the Eighth National Congress of the Party.

II

In recent years, there has been a high tide in socialist construction. After the announcement of the first Five-Year Plan, a new upsurge emerged. Whether in heavy industry, light industry, transportation, commerce, or capital construction departments, an unprecedented enthusiasm for socialist construction is evident. Many advanced producers, advanced production teams, and advanced enterprises have proposed guarantees to complete the first Five-Year Plan six months to a year ahead of schedule; some advanced workers have even completed the workload of the first Five-Year Plan and started work for 1958. In recent years, advanced workers, engineering technicians, and enterprise management personnel have tapped the potential of enterprises from various aspects, created advanced working methods, broken outdated quotas, and set an example for all workers to learn from. Moreover, the experience of these advanced producers is something that the broad masses of workers are willing to learn. Learning from the advanced has become the urgent requirement and common aspiration of the broad masses of workers. The socialist emulation drive is unfolding on an unprecedented scale and speed across the country. All of this shows that we have fully favorable conditions to mobilize and organize the broad masses of workers to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

However, it must be solemnly pointed out that there is still enormous potential within socialist enterprises that has not been fully utilized. In the same type of enterprise with the same equipment, there is still a considerable gap between advanced and backward units in completing various production targets; in the same type of work, there is also a considerable difference between advanced and backward workers in completing production targets. If we can quickly bring the backward up to the level of the advanced, we can increase enormous wealth for the country and greatly accelerate the process of socialist construction.

Therefore, one of the most effective ways to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule is to fully promote the experience of advanced producers, learn from advanced Soviet experience, carry out rationalization proposals, in order to continuously improve technology, raise technology, learn and master new technologies, improve operating methods, improve labor organization and production organization, strictly follow the requirements of product variety and product quality, mobilize the masses to break through existing quotas, reach the level of advanced producers, and strive to continuously achieve new achievements at the existing advanced level, to be fast, plentiful, good, and economical. To this end, the plenary session believes that a nationwide socialist emulation drive must be carried out in all sectors of the national economy—industry, construction, transportation, post and telecommunications, commerce, state-owned farms, pastures, and tractor stations; and the following basic measures should be adopted:

First, widely launch emulation drives among the same trades. It is required that the national committees of each industrial trade union, in conjunction with the administrative side, collect and summarize advanced experiences, establish advanced banners, and formulate specific plans for promoting advanced experiences, print and distribute pamphlets on advanced experiences (with Soviet experience attached), and activate mass activities for exchanging advanced experiences. Grassroots trade union organizations should widely adopt individual tutoring methods, mobilize workers to sign master-apprentice contracts, mutual teaching and learning contracts, universally hold "advanced experience schools," and invite advanced producers to impart advanced experience. Each industry and each locality can also hold conferences of advanced producers according to trade, hold advanced experience exhibitions, and organize observation performances, in order to implement the advanced experience of the same trade throughout the industry, mobilize the advanced to enthusiastically help the backward, and the backward to humbly learn from the experience of the advanced. It is required to raise the vast majority of workers, groups, and work teams to the level of existing advanced producers in the shortest possible time.

Second, organize national and local inter-factory emulation drives by industry or trade. This is an effective way to quickly improve the production level of enterprises. It is required that each industrial trade union and each local trade union, in conjunction with the administrative side, make comprehensive plans, formulate competition conditions and reward methods, regularly exchange experiences, evaluate and summarize, improve the leadership of intra-factory competition through inter-factory competition, and further carry out inter-factory competition on the basis of in-depth intra-factory competition; and it is required to raise backward enterprises to the existing advanced level in the shortest possible time.

Third, widely carry out excellent quality campaigns, educate workers to care about whether their products are popular in the market, strengthen quality awareness, strive to learn process technology regulations, strictly abide by technical discipline, summarize and promote advanced experience in improving product quality, establish a mass inspection system, and struggle against the phenomenon of producing defective products. At production meetings, quality issues should be frequently checked, quality exhibitions should be held, opinions on products should be collected from the sales market, and quality reward systems should be established and improved.

Fourth, strengthen trade union work in capital construction, promote advanced experience in capital construction, assist the administration in doing a good job of comprehensive planning, coordination and cooperation, and parallel operations, to ensure project quality, reduce costs, ensure safe production, accelerate progress, and strive to put into production as soon as possible.

Fifth, in conjunction with the administration, carry out rationalization proposals. Focusing on the key to enterprise production, convene mass production meetings to mobilize the masses to put forward rationalization proposals. Each industrial trade union and local trade union should generally check the situation of rationalization proposal work this year and establish a rationalization proposal inspection system. Units with good achievements in carrying out rationalization proposal work should be rewarded, and units that have not carried out well should be criticized.

Sixth, universally promote the experience of economic accounting by teams and groups. Through economic accounting by teams and groups, timely analyze weak links in production, discover advanced experience, and take various measures to save raw materials, improve quality, increase production, in order to continuously reduce costs and improve labor productivity.

Seventh, assist the administration in organizing workers to systematically study culture and technology, effectively guarantee workers' spare time for study, help workers solve difficulties in learning, and regularly supervise the quality of teaching. Special attention should be paid to helping workers master new technologies and complete the task of trial production of new national products.

Eighth, strengthen the work of trade unions among scientific workers, engineering technicians, and staff. Care about their political life and material and cultural life, continuously improve their enthusiasm and creativity, encourage them to carry out creative cooperation with production workers, organize them to actively participate in rationalization proposal work, comprehensively study and summarize the advanced experience of production workers. Sign lecture contracts with them, hold various scientific and technological lectures, and give them necessary rewards and remuneration.

Ninth, continue to conduct education on consolidating labor discipline, generally check the implementation of the enterprise's internal labor rules outline, carry out criticism and self-criticism among workers, and severely deal with individual workers who seriously violate labor discipline.

Tenth, strengthen the work of trade unions among female workers and their families. Actively solve the special difficulties of female workers, run nurseries (stations) well, do a good job of children's work, so that female workers can reduce the burden of heavy housework and engage in creative labor. Strengthen political and ideological education among workers' families, organize families to improve environmental sanitation, eliminate bedbugs, mosquitoes, flies, and fleas, prevent diseases, and ensure that workers get adequate rest.

Eleventh, require that the vast majority of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises sign collective contracts within two years, comprehensively plan the enterprise's internal production, life, and education, and other aspects of work. Regularly check the implementation of collective contracts, create favorable conditions for mobilizing the masses to carry out bottom-up criticism, in order to listen to the opinions of the masses in all aspects and comprehensively improve the work of enterprise administration and trade unions. Each industrial trade union should summarize the experience in this area this year and write a template for collective contracts, so that it can be universally promoted next year.

Twelfth, labor protection work must be strengthened, the policy of safe production must be implemented, and workers' working conditions must be actively improved. It is required that the vast majority of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises sign labor protection agreements within two years, strictly limit overtime, do a good job of equipment maintenance, conduct safety technical education, prevent liability accidents, and fight for disease prevention and injury prevention.

Thirteenth, wage and reward work must be done well, assist the government in carrying out wage reform, actively promote the piecework wage system, and establish a necessary bonus wage system (such as savings awards, quality awards, and new product trial production awards). The principles of competition rewards must also be clarified: those who help the backward reach the advanced level should be rewarded, those who strive to catch up with the advanced level should also be rewarded, and those who reach a more advanced level should be even more rewarded, correcting the so-called "survival of the fittest" thinking and practices. In the future, the quality of competition leadership should be mainly marked by how many backward units and backward workers are helped to reach the advanced level, thereby showing huge economic effects.

Fourteenth, in order to further mobilize workers across the country to greet the Eighth National Congress of the Party and strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the plenary session decided to hold a national conference of advanced producers in the capital Beijing on April 30, 1956. Before the meeting, each industrial trade union and each local trade union should widely collect, summarize, and exchange advanced experience, and elect representatives to attend the national conference of advanced producers.

III

Completing the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule is the glorious historical task of the working class across the country. This historical task is arduous and intense. To complete this historical task, trade union organizations at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party, strengthen ties with the masses, earnestly improve their leadership style, and require that all aspects of work be accelerated and efficiency be improved, opposing right-leaning conservatism. Trade union cadres must go deep among the masses, be familiar with the masses, understand the lives, thoughts, and feelings of the masses, and adopt methods that the masses like to see and hear to attract the masses to participate in various social activities, thereby educating the masses and improving the masses. Trade union organizations at all levels must highly develop the spirit of adhering to principles, strengthen mass supervision, and struggle against all bureaucratic phenomena that violate laws and discipline, harm the interests of the masses, and suppress the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, ensuring that the Party and the government's various policies and decrees can be correctly implemented, highly developing the labor enthusiasm of the masses, uniting all workers around the Party, and striving to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第四次全体会议在1956年1月13日通过的决议
    关于动员全国职工迎接中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，开展社会主义竞赛，提前完成第一个五年计划的决议
    一
    自从中国共产党七届六中全会以后，由于共产党和毛主席的英明领导，农业的、手工业的合作化运动和私营工商业的社会主义改造的高潮已经在全国范围内掀动起来了。社会主义经济的迅速发展，促进了城乡社会主义改造运动的高潮，但是这一高潮现在又反过来对社会主义工业建设形成一种极为强烈的推动力量，要求社会主义工业建设更加迅速前进。为了适应这种新的高潮形势，党中央号召我们，必须把工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省，争取提前完成第一个五年计划。中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会第四次全体会议决议：动员全国职工热烈响应党中央的号召，全面开展社会主义竞赛，争取提前完成第一个五年计划，而且以这样的实际行动，作为我们向党的第八次全国代表大会的献礼。
    二
    几年以来，社会主义建设方面是有过高潮的。在第一个五年计划公布以后，又出现了新的高涨，无论是在重工业、轻工业、交通运输业、商业或基本建设部门，都呈现着空前高涨的社会主义建设的热情。许多先进生产者、先进生产小组和先进企业，纷纷提出了提前半年到一年完成第一个五年计划的保证；甚至有的先进工人已经完成了第一个五年计划的工作量，开始了1958年的工作。几年来，先进的工人、工程技术人员和企业管理人员，从各个方面挖掘了企业的潜力，创造了先进工作方法，打破了陈旧的定额，为全体职工树立了学习的榜样。而且这种先进生产者的经验，是广大职工群众愿意学习的。向先进学习，已经成为广大职工群众的迫切要求和共同愿望。社会主义竞赛正在以空前未有的规模和速度在全国范围内展开。这一切都说明了我们是有充分有利条件来发动和组织全国职工群众提前完成第一个五年计划的。
    但是，必须郑重指出，在社会主义企业内部还有巨大的潜力没有被充分利用。在同样类型的、同样设备的企业中，先进单位和落后单位在完成各项生产指标方面还有相当大的距离；在同一工种中，先进工人和落后工人在完成生产指标方面也同样有相当大的差别。我们如果能够迅速地把落后者都提高到先进者的水平，就能够为国家增产巨大的财富，就能够大大加速社会主义建设的进程。
    因此，提前完成第一个五年计划的一个最有效的方法就是全力推广先进生产者的经验，学习苏联先进经验，开展合理化建议，以求不断改进技术、提高技术、学习和掌握新技术，改进操作方法，改善劳动组织和生产组织，严格按着产品品种和产品质量的要求，发动群众突破现有的定额，达到先进生产者的水平，并且力求在已有的先进水平上，不断地取得新的成就，做到快、多、好、省。为此目的，全会认为必须在国民经济各个部门——工业、建筑业、交通运输业、邮电业、商业、国营农场、牧场、拖拉机站开展全民性的社会主义竞赛；并且采取以下几项基本措施：
    第一、广泛开展同工种竞赛。要求各产业工会全国委员会会同行政方面，搜集和总结先进经验，树立起先进旗帜，并且拟出推广先进经验的具体计划，印发先进经验小册子（附录苏联经验），活跃交流先进经验的群众性的活动。工会基层组织应该广泛采用个别辅导的方式，发动职工群众签订师徒合同、互教互学合同，普遍举办“先进经验学校”，邀请先进生产者来传授先进经验。各产业、各地方还可按行按业召开先进生产者会议，举办先进经验展览会，组织观摩表演，以便贯彻全产业性的同工种的先进经验，发动先进者热情地帮助落后者，落后者虚心地学习先进者的经验。要求在最短时间内，将极大部分职工、小组和工作队都提高到现有的先进生产者的水平上来。
    第二、按产业或行业组织全国性的、地方性的厂际竞赛。这是迅速提高企业生产水平的有效方法。要求各产业工会和各地方工会会同行政方面作出全面规划，制订出竞赛条件和奖励办法，定期交流经验，评比总结，通过厂际竞赛改进厂内竞赛的领导，在厂内竞赛深入开展的基础上进一步开展厂际竞赛；并且要求在最短时间内，把落后企业提高到现有的先进水平上来。
    第三、广泛开展优良质量运动，教育职工群众关心自己的产品是否受到市场的欢迎，加强质量观点，努力学习工艺技术规程，严格遵守技术纪律，总结和推广提高产品质量方面的先进经验，建立群众性的检验制度，同出产废品的现象进行斗争。在生产会议上，应该经常检查质量问题，举办质量展览，收集销售市场关于产品的意见，建立和改进质量奖励制度。
    第四、加强基本建设方面的工会工作，推广基本建设方面的先进经验，协助行政做好综合规划、配合协作、平行作业，以保证工程质量，降低成本，安全生产，加速进度，争取早日投入生产。
    第五、会同行政开展合理化建议。针对企业生产关键，召开群众生产会议，发动群众提合理化建议。各产业工会和地方工会，今年要普遍检查一次合理化建议工作的情况，建立起合理化建议的检查制度。对那些开展合理化建议工作有良好成绩的单位应该给予奖励，对那些开展得不好的单位应该给予批评。
    第六、普遍推行班组经济核算的经验。通过班组经济核算，及时分析生产中的薄弱环节，发现先进经验，采取各种措施来节约原材料，提高质量，增加产量，以不断降低成本和提高劳动生产率。
    第七、协助行政组织职工系统地学习文化和技术，切实保证职工业余学习时间，帮助职工解决学习中的困难，经常监督教学的质量。特别要注意帮助职工掌握新技术，完成国家新产品试制的任务。
    第八、加强工会在科学工作者、工程技术人员和职员中的工作。关心他们的政治生活和物质文化生活，不断地提高他们的积极性和创造性，鼓励他们同生产工人进行创造性的合作，组织他们积极参加合理化建议工作，综合研究和总结生产工人的先进经验。同他们订立讲演合同，举办各种科学技术讲座，并且给予他们必要的奖励和报酬。
    第九、继续进行巩固劳动纪律的教育，普遍检查一次企业内部劳动规则纲要的执行情况，开展职工之间的批评和自我批评，对于那些严重违反劳动纪律的个别职工必须严肃处理。
    第十、加强工会的女工家属工作。主动解决女工的特殊困难，办好托儿所（站），做好儿童工作，使女工能够减轻繁重的家务负担，从事创造性的劳动。加强职工家属中的政治思想教育，组织家属搞好环境卫生，消灭臭虫、蚊子、苍蝇、跳蚤，预防疾病，保证职工得到充分的休息。
    第十一、要求两年内绝大部分工矿交通运输企业签订集体合同，全面规划企业内部的生产、生活和教育等方面的工作。定期检查集体合同的执行情况，为发动群众开展自下而上的批评创造有利条件，以便听取群众各方面的意见，全面改进企业行政和工会的工作。各产业工会应该在今年内总结这方面的经验，并且写出集体合同的范本，以便明年普遍推广。
    第十二、必须加强劳动保护工作，贯彻安全生产方针，积极改善职工的劳动条件。要求两年内绝大部分工矿交通运输企业签订劳动保护协议书，严格限制加班加点，做好设备维护工作，进行安全技术教育，防止责任事故，为防病防伤进行斗争。
    第十三、必须做好工资和奖励工作，协助政府进行工资改革，积极推行计件工资制，并且建立必要的奖励工资制度（如节约奖、质量奖和新产品试制奖）。还必须明确竞赛奖励原则：凡是先进者帮助落后者达到先进水平的应该奖励，落后者努力赶上先进水平的也应该奖励，先进者达到更先进水平的更加应该奖励，纠正所谓“优胜劣败”的思想和做法。今后竞赛领导的好坏，应该以帮助多少落后单位和落后工人达到先进水平，从而显示出巨大的经济效果为主要标志。
    第十四、为了进一步动员全国职工迎接党的第八次全国代表大会，争取提前完成第一个五年计划，全会决议在1956年四月三十日在首都北京召开全国先进生产者代表会议。会前，各产业工会和各地方工会应该广泛搜集、总结和交流先进经验，选出出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表。
    三
    提前完成第一个五年计划，是全国工人阶级的光荣的历史任务。这个历史任务是艰巨的、紧张的。要完成这一个历史任务，工会各级组织必须在党的领导下，加强同群众的联系，切实改进领导作风，要求各方面工作都要加快速度，提高效率，反对右倾保守。工会干部必须深入群众，熟悉群众，了解群众的生活、思想和感情，采用群众喜闻乐见的方式来吸引群众参加各种社会活动，从而教育群众，提高群众。工会各级组织必须高度发挥坚持原则的精神，加强群众监督，向一切违法乱纪、危害群众利益、压抑群众的积极性和创造性的官僚主义现象进行斗争，保证党和政府的各项政策和法令能够正确贯彻执行，高度发挥群众的劳动热忱，把全体职工团结在党的周围，为提前完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
