Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 27th. U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles delivered a foreign policy speech at a "Philadelphia Bulletin" forum on February 25th. He mainly talked about international trade and the so-called U.S. economic aid to other countries.

Dulles's speech revealed his extreme unease about the economic aspects of what he called the Soviet Union's "new attitude" in trading with Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian countries and its provision of technical assistance to these countries. Dulles said that the Soviet Union's policy "has already gained great prestige among the people of the less developed countries." He said: "In these countries, 'industrialization' is a magic word. It is a slogan that the people have already believed will solve all domestic economic and political problems. The people of these countries do not like to rely on the industrialized West for manufactured goods. Most of them have already achieved political independence, but they do not yet have what they consider to be sufficient economic independence. The people of Asian neighboring countries have seen the Soviet Union develop into a major industrial power within a generation."

However, Dulles attempted to give the impression that the Soviet Union's policy aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and insisted that "the intention behind the Soviet economic movement is to subvert the countries it targets and communize them."

Dulles said, "We (the United States - editor) do not need to 'panic'" because of the Soviet Union's economic policy. He called on American monopoly capitalists to increase the export of private capital to economically backward countries. At the same time, he praised the role of the U.S. government in trying to ensure the safety of American capital investment in economically backward countries.

Dulles insisted that the military strength of the United States must not be weakened in any case, and that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and other military alliances concluded by the United States with other countries must be strengthened.

    杜勒斯对苏联援助其他国家发展经济表示不安
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社华盛顿27日讯：美国国务卿杜勒斯2月25日在“费城公报”座谈会上发表外交政策演说。他所谈的主要是国际贸易和美国对其他国家的所谓经济援助问题。
    杜勒斯的演说透露了他对他所谓的苏联同中东和东南亚国家进行贸易和它正在给这些国家的技术援助的“新态度”的经济方面极为不安。杜勒斯说，苏联的这种政策“已经在较落后的国家的人民中获得了很大的威望”。他说：“在这些国家中，‘工业化’是一个具有魔力的字眼。它是人民已经相信将会解决一切国内经济和政治问题的一个口号。这些国家的人民不喜欢依赖工业化的西方来获得制成品。它们大部分已经获得政治独立，但是它们还没有它们认为是充分的经济独立。亚洲邻国人民已经看到苏联在一代之内发展成为一个重要的工业国。”
    但是杜勒斯企图给人以这种印象，仿佛苏联的政策目的在于干涉其他国家的内政，并且硬说“苏联经济运动后面的意图是颠覆成为它的目标的国家并且使之共产化”。
    杜勒斯说，“我们（美国——编者）不必”因为苏联的经济政策而“感到恐慌”，他要求美国垄断资本家增加对经济落后国家的私人资本的输出。同时，他赞扬美国政府在设法保证美国在经济落后国家进行资本投资的安全方面所起的作用。
    杜勒斯坚持，美国的军事力量无论如何不可削弱，北大西洋联盟、东南亚条约组织、巴格达条约以及美国同其他国家缔结的其他军事联盟必须加强。
