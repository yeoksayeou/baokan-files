    National Industry and Commerce Youth Activists Congress Continues
    Lai Ruoyu and Sha Qianli Deliver Speeches and Reports Respectively
    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a speech at the National Industry and Commerce Youth Activists Congress on the 24th. He first extended a warm welcome on behalf of the trade union organizations to the active and leading actions of the youth in industry and commerce in accepting socialist transformation. He said that the working class is very willing to help you study and transform yourselves in labor and work. If capitalists adopt a positive attitude towards socialist transformation, the working class will warmly welcome them. Your enterprises have already been jointly operated; you are not only capitalists, but also enterprise employees. When trade union organizations organize socialist competitions and various social activities, they will absorb you to participate. Your beneficial suggestions can be supported by the trade union. When you completely abandon exploitation and become self-reliant laborers, the masses of employees will warmly welcome you to join the ranks of the working class, and the trade union organization will also absorb you as members. By that time, the bourgeoisie will be eliminated, and the individual capitalist will become a glorious member of the working class. Since there is such a bright and splendid prospect before us, all young people in industry and commerce should abandon all concerns about personal gains and losses, actively implement the country's policies, and take the lead in the transformation of enterprises and individual self-transformation.
    Sha Qianli, Minister of the Ministry of Local Industry of the People's Republic of China, made a report at the meeting today.
    Finally, the conference read out a batch of congratulatory letters from young people in industry and commerce from various places. As of the 23rd, the conference had received a large number of congratulatory telegrams and letters from young people in industry and commerce in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, Jinan, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hohhot, Heilongjiang, Jilin and other provinces and cities.

    全国工商界青年积极分子大会继续举行
    赖若愚和沙千里分别致词和作报告
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚24日在全国工商界青年积极分子大会上致词。他首先代表工会组织对工商界青年在接受社会主义改造中的积极带头行动，表示热烈的欢迎。他说，工人阶级十分愿意在劳动中、工作中帮助你们学习，帮助你们进行改造。如果资本家对社会主义改造采取积极的态度，那末，工人阶级就一定会热烈地予以欢迎。你们的企业已经合营了，你们已经不仅是资本家，同时是企业职员了，工会组织在组织社会主义竞赛和各种社会活动的时候，将要吸收你们参加。工会的某些会议也可以请你们列席。你们一切有益的建议，都可以受到工会的支持。当你们彻底放弃了剥削，成为自食其力的劳动者的时候，职工群众也一定热烈地欢迎你们参加到工人阶级的队伍中来，工会组织也会吸收你们作会员。到那时候，资产阶级消灭了，而资本家个人却成为光荣的工人阶级的一分子了。既然有这样一个光辉灿烂的前景摆在面前，那末，所有的工商界青年就应抛弃一切个人得失的顾虑，积极地执行国家的各项政策，并且在企业的改造和个人自我改造方面起带头作用。
    中华人民共和国地方工业部部长沙千里今天到会作了报告。
    大会最后宣读了一批各地工商界青年写来的祝贺信。到23日止，大会已经收到了北京、上海、武汉、沈阳、济南、南京、苏州、呼和浩特、黑龙江、吉林等省市工商界青年的大批贺电和贺信。
