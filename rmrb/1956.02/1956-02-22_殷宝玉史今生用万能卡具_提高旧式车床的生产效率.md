    Yin Baoyu and Shi Jinsheng use universal chucks
    to improve the production efficiency of old lathes
    On the 18th, in the medium-voltage workshop of the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, veteran worker Yin Baoyu and technician Shi Jinsheng demonstrated the universal chuck they had successfully tested on an old belt-driven lathe. This type of chuck can process 11 kinds of parts, increasing production efficiency by up to thirty-four times, and at the very least by three times. Using this chuck to process parts also guarantees that no defective products will be produced.
    The medium-voltage workshop of this factory has a very large task this year. Utilizing this improved chuck by Yin Baoyu and Shi Jinsheng, the medium-voltage workshop can complete this year's task for 11 kinds of parts within two months; among them, one type of part can complete the entire year's task in just 9 days. It is estimated that it can create more than 10,000 yuan of wealth for the country throughout the year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    殷宝玉史今生用万能卡具
    提高旧式车床的生产效率
    18日，沈阳高压开关厂的中压车间里，老工人殷宝玉和技术员史今生在一台旧式皮带车床上表演了他俩试验成功的万能卡具。用这种卡具能加工11种部件，最高可以提高生产效率三十四倍，最低也能提高三倍。用这种卡具加工部件，还能保证不出废品。
    这个厂的中压车间今年任务很大。利用殷宝玉和史今生改进的这种卡具，中压车间有11种部件可以在两个月内完成今年任务；其中有一种部件只要9天就能完成全年任务。预计全年可以给国家创造1万多元的财富。　（新华社）
