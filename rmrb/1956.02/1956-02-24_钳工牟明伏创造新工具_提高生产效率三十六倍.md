Fitter Mou Mingfu Creates New Tool
    Increasing Production Efficiency by Thirty-Six Times

    Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant's gear workshop's young fitter, Mou Mingfu, has created a new tool for deburring gears, increasing production efficiency by thirty-six times.

    After gears are processed by machine tools, they are left with burrs as sharp as sewing needles. In the past, workers used files and wire brushes to remove the many burrs in the tooth gaps, resulting in very low production efficiency. With this newly created electric tool, Mou Mingfu can deburr a gear in 10 seconds that used to take 6 minutes, and the gear quality is very good.

    After nearly a week of testing, this new tool has proven to be suitable for deburring precision medium and small gears. (Xinhua News Agency)

    钳工牟明伏创造新工具
    提高生产效率三十六倍
    沈阳第一机床厂齿轮车间青年钳工牟明伏创造出一种整刷齿轮毛刺的新工具，提高生产效率三十六倍。
    齿轮经过机床加工以后，会留下来一根根像缝衣针一样尖利的毛刺。过去工人们拿锉刀和钢丝刷子来刷掉齿缝中的许多毛刺，生产效率很低。牟明伏用这种新创造的电动工具，把过去需要整刷6分钟的齿轮，在10秒钟内就可整刷好，齿轮质量很好。
    这种新工具经过将近一星期来的试验，证明适合于整刷精密的中、小齿轮。　　　　　（新华社）
