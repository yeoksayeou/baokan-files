    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 22nd Dispatch: The morning session of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on February 22 continued to discuss the CPSU Central Committee's directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The speakers included Kalchenko, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic; Pervukhin, Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee; Yefremov, Secretary of the Kuibyshev Oblast Party Committee; Chernyshev, Minister of the Soviet Coal Industry; Shvernik, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions; and Kunayev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic. During the morning session, representatives from the Syrian and Lebanese, Japanese, and Brazilian Communist Parties delivered congratulatory messages.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, via TASS: The afternoon session of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on February 21 began discussing the report made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin.
    
    The representatives who spoke during the discussion included Yasnov of the Russian Federation, Mazurov of Belarus, Yelyutin of Moscow, and Laptev and Belyayev of Chelyabinsk. They discussed the tasks and specific measures for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union and various regions in the next five years. Everyone agreed that the realization of the tasks stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan will guarantee the rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production in the Soviet Union and the further improvement of the people's material welfare.
    
    In his speech, Yasnov cited some materials to illustrate the development prospects of the national economy of the Russian Federation during the new Five-Year Plan. He pointed out that Siberia will become one of the largest bases for coal mining and electricity production in the country in the next 10 years. Yasnov also expressed his complete agreement with the proposal of Kirichenko, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukrainian Republic, to launch a socialist competition between the Russian Federation and the Ukrainian Republic, as well as between the various states of the two republics, in order to strive for the successful completion of the task of further developing agriculture put forward by the Party.
    
    In his speech, Belyayev focused on agricultural issues. He said that the Soviet Union has all the conditions to vigorously develop agricultural production. In the Soviet Union, the socialist agricultural economy is now in an absolutely dominant position, with a highly developed network of machine tractor stations and tens of thousands of skilled specialists. The capital invested in agriculture during the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be nearly twice as much as in the previous Five-Year Plan. All of this not only makes it possible to complete the agricultural production tasks for the next five years, but also to overfulfill them.
    
    In his speech, Yelyutin talked about higher education. He said that during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the number of experts graduating from universities and colleges in the Soviet Union will increase by one and a half times. Great importance will be attached to the development of universities and colleges in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. In 1960, universities and colleges across the country will train 71,200 engineers, which will be twice as many as in 1950.
    
    Those present warmly welcomed the speech of Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany. He extended congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the Communist Party of Germany and all progressive people in the Federal Republic of Germany.
    
    Reimann said that the Soviet Union's policy of peace and mutual understanding has enhanced its prestige. Hundreds of thousands of West German residents sincerely welcome the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany.
    
    However, there are forces in West Germany that attempt to hinder the establishment of good relations with the Soviet people and dream of revenge. We Communists will redouble our efforts to deliver a fatal blow to the attempts of German militarists to undermine peace, unite all workers and patriots into a solid front against militarism, and thus lead the residents of West Germany along the path of peace, democracy, and progress.
    
    Subsequently, Koplenig, representing the Communist Party of Austria, delivered a congratulatory message to the Congress. He said that due to the Soviet Union's peace policy, Austria concluded a state treaty last year, thereby gaining autonomy. However, forces attempting to undermine Austria's neutrality and place Austria under the control of aggressors for the benefit of imperialist aggressors are still active in Austria. The Austrian people desire peace, neutrality, and the independence of their country, and will do everything in their power to defend them. We Communists believe that it is our responsibility to lead this struggle and will strive to strengthen the friendship between the Austrian and Soviet peoples.
    
    Next, Congress Chairman Furtseva read out the congratulatory message from the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    
    The afternoon session of the 21st ended here.

    苏共代表大会讨论布尔加宁的报告
    本报莫斯科22日专电　苏联共产党第二十次代表大会22日上午会议继续讨论苏共中央对于第六个五年计划的指示。先后发言的有乌克兰共和国部长会议主席卡尔钦科，苏共中央主席团委员别尔乌辛，古比雪夫州党委书记叶甫列莫夫，苏联采煤工业部部长切尔尼切夫，全苏工会中央委员会主席什维尔尼克，哈萨克共和国部长会议主席库纳耶夫。在上午会议上，叙利亚和黎巴嫩、日本、巴西共产党代表先后致了贺词。
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯　苏联共产党第二十次代表大会2月21日下午会议，开始讨论苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁作的报告。
    在讨论中发言的代表有俄罗斯联邦的雅斯诺夫、白俄罗斯的马祖罗夫、莫斯科的叶留金、车里雅宾斯克的拉普捷夫和别利亚耶夫。他们谈到了今后5年中全苏联和各个地区在发展国民经济方面的任务和具体措施。大家认为，实现了第六个五年计划所规定的任务，将能够保证苏联工农业生产的迅速增长和人民物质福利的进一步提高。
    雅斯诺夫在发言中援引了一些材料说明俄罗斯联邦的国民经济在新五年计划期间的发展前景。他指出，西伯利亚在今后10年中将成为全国采煤和电力生产方面的一个最大的基地。雅斯诺夫并且表示完全同意乌克兰共和国共产党中央委员会第一书记基里钦科的提议，在俄罗斯联邦和乌克兰共和国之间，以及在两个共和国的各州之间展开社会主义竞赛，以便争取顺利地完成党所提出的进一步发展农业的任务。
    别利亚耶夫在发言中着重谈到了农业问题。他说，苏联有一切条件来大力发展农业生产。在苏联，社会主义农业经济现在处于绝对优势的地位，它有高度发展的机器拖拉机站网，有成千上万的熟练专门人材。在第六个五年计划期间投入农业的资金将近比上一个五年计划多一倍。所有这些不仅使今后五年的农业生产任务有可能完成，而且能够超额完成。
    叶留金在发言中谈的是高等教育问题。他说，在第六个五年计划期间，苏联从高等学校毕业的专家的人数将增加到一倍半。在苏联东部地区发展高等学校的问题将受到很大的重视。1960年，全国各高等学校将培养出71，200名工程师，即将增加到1950年的两倍。
    到会的人热烈欢迎德国共产党中央委员会第一书记马·雷曼的讲话。他代表德国共产党和德意志联邦共和国的所有进步人士向代表大会致贺。
    雷曼说，苏联执行的和平和互相谅解的政策提高了它的威信。成千上万的西德居民衷心地欢迎苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系。
    但是，在西德存在着企图阻碍同苏联人民建立良好关系和梦想实行报复的势力。我们共产党人将加倍努力，以便给德国军国主义分子破坏和平的企图以致命的回击，把所有工人和爱国者团结成一条巩固的反对军国主义的战线，从而引导西德居民沿着和平、民主、进步的道路前进。
    随后，柯普勒尼希代表奥地利共产党向大会致贺词。他说，由于苏联的和平政策，奥地利在去年缔结了国家条约，从而获得了自主。但是，为帝国主义侵略者的利益而企图破坏奥地利的中立和把奥地利归侵略者控制的势力，仍然在奥地利进行活动。奥地利人民希望和平、中立和自己国家的独立，并且将用全力来捍卫它们。我们共产党人认为，领导这个斗争是我们的责任，并且将努力争取加强奥地利人民同苏联人民之间的友谊。
    接着，大会主席福尔采娃宣读了美国共产党全国委员会致苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的贺词。
    21日下午会议到此结束。
