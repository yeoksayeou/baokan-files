N.M. Shvernik spoke at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on February 23rd. He talked about the tasks facing the Soviet trade unions.

Speaking of the great creative efforts of the Soviet people, Shvernik emphasized that all the work of the Communist Party since the 19th National Congress has been carried out under the slogan of strengthening the inseparable ties with the masses, and this work is filled with deep confidence in the people and their infinite creative power.

Shvernik said that at all stages of the construction of a new society, the trade unions have always been loyal supporters of the Party's policies.

Shvernik spoke about the role of Soviet trade unions in developing socialist competition and enhancing the creative initiative and enthusiasm of the working people. He pointed out that trade unions must pay more attention to the issues of production quotas and wages, and must be more concerned with satisfying the demands of workers and staff.

Shvernik said that Soviet workers, engineers, technicians, and staff will welcome the important measures planned by the Party: the transition to a seven-hour working day, the reduction of the working day for young workers and workers in some major industrial sectors to six hours, the implementation of a five-day work week with two days off in certain industrial sectors, and the increase of wages for low-income staff.

Shvernik continued: Under capitalism, more than half of each working day is used to produce profits and increase the wealth of capitalists. According to the far from precise estimates made by bourgeois economists, about 60% of the total time an American worker works for a capitalist is uncompensated.

Soviet workers are working for themselves and for their country. Every hour of a Soviet worker's working day contributes to the cause of communist construction and the improvement of people's welfare.

In the final part of his speech, Shvernik pointed out that Soviet trade unions are constantly strengthening and expanding their international ties with trade unions of various countries. In the past four years, nearly 500 trade union delegations and workers' delegations from 74 countries have visited the Soviet Union. This has greatly promoted and strengthened our contacts with foreign worker organizations. The trade union departments of the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom have recently advocated expanding contacts with Soviet trade unions and exchanging delegations for visits.

Shvernik said that we sincerely welcome this proposal and believe that it is beneficial to establish friendly contacts with all trade union organizations, regardless of their political and religious inclinations. However, not everyone shares our view. For example, the leaders of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions oppose joint actions with the World Federation of Trade Unions and the national trade unions that participate in the World Federation of Trade Unions, although trade unions must pursue common goals in the struggle for the immediate interests of the working people.

They do not like the Soviet trade unions working under the leadership of the Communist Party, and they do not like the fact that there are no strikes or work stoppages in the Soviet Union.

Shvernik said: Yes, Soviet trade unions do work under the leadership of the workers' class party, its vanguard Communist Party. Our Party has enhanced the role of trade unions in satisfying the ever-increasing material demands of workers and staff. Then, what is so surprising about the fact that the Party leads the Soviet trade unions in their efforts to strengthen the socialist country that is entirely run by the workers, peasants, and intellectuals themselves?

The rock-solid unity of the Party and the Soviet people is disliked by our enemies, although it is praised by all people with progressive ideas around the world. Well, what can we do? Similarly, we also dislike the conspicuous unity that the heads of the "free" trade unions have reached with the imperialists at the expense of the immediate interests of the working people.

Shvernik continued: What is incomprehensible and unwilling to be understood by the heads of the "free" trade unions is precisely what the workers thoroughly understand. In an American worker delegation that visited the Soviet Union was Mr. Hilliard Ellis, a compatriot of Mr. Meany, the president of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations. Hilliard Ellis studied the living conditions of Soviet workers and wrote a report on his visit to the Soviet Union. This report, published in the United States, explained in an easy-to-understand way why there are no and cannot be strikes in the Soviet Union.

In his report, he asked: Can it be imagined that a carpenter building a house for himself would go on strike to hinder the work of building housing for himself and his family? The Soviet worker is such a carpenter building a house for himself. It is difficult to put it better than this American worker's statement.

Mr. Meany hopes that the Soviet trade unions will organize strikes to hinder the construction of communism. But he himself opposes the strikes organized by workers in capitalist enterprises.

Not long ago, Mr. Meany spoke at a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers, saying that he had never gone on strike in his life, had never led a strike, had never ordered anyone to strike, and had never participated in picket lines. This is Mr. Meany's understanding of trade union freedom. Needless to say, American workers, like workers in other countries, disagree with this policy, disagree with this policy of "free" trade unions.

Shvernik added: Soviet trade unions are fighting for the unity of the labor movement and call on the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions to take joint action for the immediate interests of the working people and world peace.

Soviet trade unions have fought for and will continue to fight for trade union rights. The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, representing all trade unions, expressed its indignation at a police "judgment" issued by Austrian Interior Minister Helmer, according to which the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which unites more than 85 million workers and staff in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Black Africa, were banned. All progressive mankind condemns this crude act of tyranny, considering it a shameful atrocity against the dignity and conscience of the working people united in the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Shvernik said that Soviet trade unions will expand and deepen their fraternal ties with trade unions of all countries around the world and will strengthen the unity of the international labor movement.

    什维尔尼克在苏共代表大会上的发言（摘要）
    尼·米·什维尔尼克2月23日在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上发了言。他谈到了苏联工会所面临的任务。
    什维尔尼克在谈到苏联人民的伟大的创造性努力的时候着重指出：共产党在第十九次代表大会以后的全部工作，都是在加强同群众的不可分割的联系这样一个口号下进行的，在这种工作中充满了对人民和他们的无穷无尽的创造性力量的深刻的信心。
    什维尔尼克说：在建设新社会的一切阶段中，工会一直是党的政策的忠实的支持者。
    什维尔尼克谈到了苏联工会在发展社会主义竞赛和提高劳动人民的创造性的主动性和积极性方面所起的作用。他指出：工会必须更多地注意生产定额问题和工资问题，必须更多地关心满足职工的要求的问题。
    什维尔尼克说：苏联工人、工程师、技术人员和职员将欢迎党计划采取的重要措施：过渡到七小时工作制，少年工人和一些主要工业部门的工人的工作日缩短为六小时，在某些工业部门中实行每周工作五天、休息两天的制度，并且提高收入低的工作人员的工资。
    什维尔尼克接着说：在资本主义之下，每个劳动日的一半以上的时间是用来生产利润和增加资本家的财富的。根据资产阶级经济学家所作的绝非精确的估计，在一个美国工人为资本家劳动的全部时间中，约有60％是得不到报酬的。
    苏联工人在为他自己、为他的国家工作。苏联工人的工作日中的每一小时都有助于促进共产主义建设事业和提高人民福利。
    什维尔尼克在发言的最后部分指出，苏联工会正在不断加强和扩大同各国工会的国际联系。在过去四年中，有74个国家的将近500个工会代表团和工人代表团访问了苏联。这一来，就大大促进和加强了我们同外国工人组织的接触。美国、日本和英国的工会部门最近都主张扩大同苏联工会的接触，并且互派代表团进行访问。
    什维尔尼克说，我们衷心欢迎这种主张，并且认为，同一切工会组织，不管它们的政治和宗教倾向如何，建立友好接触是有益的。但是，并不是所有人都同我们抱着同样的看法。例如，国际自由工会联合会的领袖们反对同世界工会联合会和参加世界工会联合会的各国工会采取联合行动，虽然工会在争取劳动人民的切身利益的斗争中必须追求共同的目的。
    他们不喜欢在共产党的领导下进行工作的苏联工会，不喜欢在苏联没有罢工和停工的这种情况。
    什维尔尼克说：是的，苏联工会的确是在工人阶级的政党、它的先锋队共产党的领导下进行工作的。我们的党提高了工会在满足职工的不断提高的物质要求这一方面的作用。那末，党领导苏联工会为加强完全由工人、农民和知识分子自己当家作主的社会主义国家而进行努力，这件事又有什么可惊奇的呢？
    党和苏联人民的像磐石一样的团结是我们的敌人所不喜欢的，虽然这是全世界一切具有进步思想的人们所称赞的。嗯，我们怎么办呢，同样，我们也是不喜欢“自由”工会的首脑们在牺牲劳动人民切身利益的情况下同帝国主义者达成的那种引人注意的团结。
    什维尔尼克接着说：为“自由”工会的首脑们所不能理解而且也不愿意理解的，正是工人们彻底理解的。在一个访问了苏联的美国工人代表团中，有美国劳工联合会—产业工会联合会主席米尼先生的同胞希拉德·艾利斯。希拉德·艾利斯研究了苏联工人们的生活情况，写了一篇关于访问苏联的报告。这篇在美国出版了的报告用人们易于了解的方式说明了在苏联没有而且也不可能有罢工的原因。
    他在他的报告中问道：可以设想一个为自己建造房屋的木工举行罢工而妨碍为他自己和自己的家人建造住房的工作吗？苏联工人就是这样一个为自己建造房屋的木工。很难比这个美国工人的提法提得更好的了。
    米尼先生希望苏联工会组织罢工来妨碍共产主义的建设。可是他自己却反对资本主义企业中的工人们所组织的罢工。
    不久以前，米尼先生曾经在全国制造商协会会议上讲话，他说，他一生从来没有罢过工，从来没有领导过罢工，从来没有命令过任何人罢工，也从来没有参与罢工纠察队的活动。这就是米尼先生对于工会自由的理解。不用说，美国工人同其他国家的工人一样，是不同意这种政策，不同意这种“自由”工会的政策的。
    什维尔尼克又说：苏联工会为争取劳工运动的团结而斗争，并且号召国际自由工会联合会为了劳动人民的切身利益和全世界和平而采取共同的行动。
    苏联工会过去曾经为、将来还要为争取工会权利而斗争。全苏工会中央理事会代表所有工会，对于奥地利内政部长赫尔麦先生所下的一项警察“判决”表示愤慨，根据这项警察“判决”禁止了把欧洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲和黑非洲的8，500多万职工团结在自己的队伍里的世界工会联合会的活动。全体进步人类都斥责这种粗暴的专横行动，认为它是对团结在世界工会联合会里面的劳动人民的尊严和良心所采取的可耻的暴行。
    什维尔尼克说：苏联工会将扩大并且加深自己同全世界各国工会的兄弟般的联系，将加强国际劳工运动队伍的团结。
