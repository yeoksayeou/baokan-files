    The Vice-Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and Executive Committee Member and Council Member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Solovyov, published an article in "Pravda" on February 8, defending the rights of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Solovyov wrote that the World Federation of Trade Unions engages in activities honestly and openly, protecting the vital rights of working people. The World Federation of Trade Unions is an officially recognized organization, and it informs the Austrian public of its activities as widely as possible.
    Solovyov then pointed out that the "reasons" put forward by the Austrian Minister of the Interior for banning the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions are completely unfounded. He believes that the measures taken by the Austrian police authorities are a blatant violation of basic trade union rights.
    Solovyov wrote that, obviously, the problem is that certain imperialist groups, disregarding Austria's independence and neutrality, are taking measures to instigate a police action against the World Federation of Trade Unions. These groups have been trying every possible means to undermine and eliminate the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    Solovyov concluded by writing that the Austrian authorities' crude and arbitrary behavior towards the World Federation of Trade Unions has aroused the anger of not only the working class, but also of all honest people.
    The Chairman of the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions, František Zupka, sent a telegram to Austrian Chancellor Raab, on behalf of all members of the Czechoslovak Trade Unions, protesting the ban on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Austria and demanding that this unjust and discriminatory decision be revoked.
    The Central Council of Trade Unions of the Romanian People's Republic, on behalf of all its members, sent a telegram to Austrian Federal Chancellor Raab, protesting the Austrian government's ban on the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Austria. The telegram stated that this action constitutes an unimaginable interference by the Austrian authorities in the activities of an international workers' organization and demanded the revocation of this measure.

    抗议奥地利政府禁止世界工联活动
    全苏工会中央理事会副主席、世界工联执行委员和理事索洛维耶夫2月8日在“真理报”上发表文章，捍卫世界工联的权利。索洛维耶夫写道，世界工联诚实而公开地从事活动，保护着劳动人民的切身权利。世界工联是得到官方承认的组织，它尽可能广泛地把自己的活动告诉奥地利公众。
    索洛维耶夫接着指出，奥地利内政部长提出的禁止世界工联活动的“理由”是完全没有根据的，他认为奥地利警察当局的措施是公然破坏基本的工会权利。
    索洛维耶夫写道，显然，问题是某些帝国主义集团渺视奥地利的独立和中立，采取措施来策动一次反对世界工联的警察行动，这些集团一直在千方百计地想破坏和消灭世界工联。
    索洛维耶夫最后写道，奥地利当局对于世界工会联合会粗暴的专横行为引起了不仅是工人阶级、而且是所有正直人们的愤怒。
    捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会主席弗朗齐歇克·苏普卡打电报给奥地利总理拉布，代表捷克斯洛伐克工会全体会员对禁止世界工会联合会在奥地利活动一事表示抗议，并且要求撤销这种不公正的和歧视性的决定。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国工会中央理事会代表它全体会员打电报给奥地利联邦总理拉布，就奥政府禁止世界工会联合会在奥地利境内活动一事提出抗议。电报认为，这种行动构成了奥国当局对一个国际工人组织的活动的不可想像的干涉，并且要求撤销这种措施。
