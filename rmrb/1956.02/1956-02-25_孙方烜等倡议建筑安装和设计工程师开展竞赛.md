Sun Fangxuan and Others Advocate for a Competition Among Building Installation and Design Engineers

Engineers Sun Fangxuan, Bao Qiguo, and 15 others from the Southwest First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering proposed a socialist competition among engineers in national building installation enterprises and design units at the company's recent labor model conference.

Sun Fangxuan and others guaranteed that they, along with the employees of the Southwest First Engineering Company, would comprehensively and ahead of schedule complete the company's 1956 construction plan. The main competition conditions proposed by Sun Fangxuan and the other 16 included promoting various new technologies, reducing cement consumption, and increasing formwork turnover rate; popularizing the advanced experience of cold-drawing steel bars to save steel; promoting the use of *nanmu* bamboo scaffolding; ensuring that project quality meets design requirements and national standards; widely promoting the advanced construction management experience of mixed work teams to ensure that the building area managed by each technician is doubled compared to last year; and actively promoting integrated hoisting methods to increase construction speed by 35%, etc.

Currently, the engineers of the Southwest First Engineering Company have completed the design of the *nanmu* bamboo scaffolding ahead of schedule and have decided to promote its use in the second quarter, six months ahead of schedule. At the same time, they will also promote bamboo scaffolding boards. The technical problem of increasing the tensile strength of steel bars has also been resolved ahead of schedule. They are now working on resolving equipment issues. (Xinhua News Agency)

    孙方烜等倡议建筑安装和设计工程师开展竞赛
    建筑工程部西南第一工程公司工程师孙方烜、包其国等17人，在这个公司最近召开的劳动模范大会上提出全国建筑安装企业和设计单位的工程师之间开展社会主义竞赛的倡议。
    孙方烜等人保证和西南第一工程公司职工一起全面提前完成这个公司1956年的施工计划。孙方烜等17人提出的主要竞赛条件中，有推行各种新技术，降低水泥用量，提高模板周转率；推广钢筋冷拉先进经验，节约钢筋；推广使用楠竹里脚手架；保证工程质量合乎设计要求及国家规范；广泛推行混合工作队的先进施工管理经验，做到每个技术人员管理的建筑面积比去年增加一倍；积极推行综合吊装法，提高施工速度35％等。
    现在西南第一工程公司的工程师们已经提前完成了楠竹里脚手架的设计工作，并且决定提前6个月在第二季度推广使用，同时还要推广竹子跳板。提高钢筋拉力的技术问题也已经提前解决。现在正在着手解决设备问题。　（新华社）
