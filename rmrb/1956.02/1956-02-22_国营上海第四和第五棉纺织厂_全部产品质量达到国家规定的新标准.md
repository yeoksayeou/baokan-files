    State-owned Shanghai No. 4 and No. 5 Cotton Textile Factories
    All Product Quality Meets New National Standards

    The East China Textile Administration Bureau issued a circular on the 17th, commending the state-owned Shanghai No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory and No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory for their attention to improving product quality. These two factories, by fully mobilizing the masses of workers, were the first to bring the quality of all their products up to the new national standards. The cotton yarn contains no more than 90 to 95 neps and impurities per 10 grains (one-seventh of a pound) under light inspection.

    The No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory failed to complete its quality plan in the first and third quarters of last year, and the quality of its cotton yarn was once the worst among the state-owned textile factories in Shanghai. Starting from the fourth quarter, the factory director and chief engineer were determined to regularly lead technicians to advanced factories to learn production experience. In January of this year, they also established a regular mutual learning contact system with technicians from the No. 1, No. 5, and No. 14 Cotton Textile Factories. All the factory's technicians were organized according to different processes of spinning and weaving, and five technical research groups were established. From November last year to now, technicians and technical workers have jointly studied more than 120 specialized problems, of which 79 have been implemented in production. Workers throughout the factory have also successively launched socialist competitions to improve operating skills. In December of last year and January of this year, the factory completed 100% of its cotton yarn quality plan; in February, the quality of all cotton yarn reached the higher standards stipulated by the state. Recently, they have put forward specific measures to learn from advanced factories.

    The No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory established a special working group to study how to improve product quality. At a production meeting, workers throughout the factory put forward 165 rationalization proposals for improving production. The original plan to improve the small grid of the carding machine in half a year was completed in just over half a month after workers' discussion. Ding Huaibao, the winding worker in the cotton cleaning workshop who used to have the most waste, has now become an advanced worker with the least waste and has been repeatedly commended.

    国营上海第四和第五棉纺织厂
    全部产品质量达到国家规定的新标准
    华东纺织管理局17日发出通报，表扬注意提高产品质量的国营上海第四棉纺织厂和第五棉纺织厂。这两个厂因为充分发动职工群众，首先使全部产品质量达到国家规定的新标准，每10个格林（七百分之一磅）的棉纱，在灯光检验下所含的棉结杂质都不超过90粒到95粒。
    第四棉纺织厂去年第一、第三两个季度都没有完成质量计划，棉纱质量曾经是上海国营纺织厂中最差的厂。从第四季度起，厂长、总工程师下决心经常带领技术人员到先进厂去学习生产经验，今年1月，又同第一、第五、第十四等棉纺织厂的技术人员建立了定期相互学习的联系制度，全厂的技术人员都按纺纱、织布的不同工序组织起来，成立了5个技术研究组。去年11月到现在，技术人员和技术工人一起研究了120多项专门问题，其中79项已经贯彻到生产中去。全厂工人也先后开展了提高操作技术的社会主义竞赛。去年12月和今年1月，全厂棉纱质量百分之百完成了计划；2月份，全部棉纱质量又达到了国家规定的更高标准。最近，他们又提出了向先进厂学习的具体措施。
    第五棉纺织厂为了研究提高产品质量，成立了专门工作组。在一次生产会议上，全厂职工提了165条改进生产的合理化建议。原来准备半年时间内改进梳棉机小漏底的计划，经过工人讨论，结果半个多月就完成了。清棉车间过去退卷最多的挡车工丁怀宝，现在一跃而为退卷最少、一再受到表扬的先进工人。　（新华社）
