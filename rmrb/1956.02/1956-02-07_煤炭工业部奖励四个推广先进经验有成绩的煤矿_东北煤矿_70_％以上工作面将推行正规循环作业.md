The Ministry of Coal Industry Rewards Four Coal Mines with Achievements in Promoting Advanced Experience
Over 70% of Work Surfaces in Northeast China Coal Mines to Implement Regular Cyclic Operations

At the recent Northeast Coal Mines Advanced Experience Exchange Conference, four coal mines with achievements in promoting advanced experience were rewarded by the Ministry of Coal Industry. These four units are: Ping'an Mine of Fuxin Mining Bureau, Mashan Mine and Didao Mine of Jixi Mining Bureau, and Longfeng Mine of Fushun Mining Bureau.

Since 1954, Ping'an Mine has been learning from the advanced experience of grassroots management in Soviet coal mines, and has implemented regular cyclic operations in both coal mining and tunneling. Mashan Mine and Didao Mine have been promoting the advanced experience of Ping'an Mine's regular cyclic operation for coal mining and one-shift coal mining system since 1955. Longfeng Mine has also actively learned the production management methods of the Kirov Mine in the Soviet Union and promoted small-scale mechanization. All indicators of these four mines in 1955 exceeded the national planned targets.

This year, coal mines in Northeast China will promote the advanced experience of regular cyclic operation in the one-meter thick coal seam organization of Ping'an Mine of Fuxin Mining Bureau on more than 70% of the work surfaces. It is estimated that the output of the work surfaces implementing this experience this year will increase by more than 10% compared to the plan.

Regular cyclic operation is an advanced experience in organizing production in grassroots units of Soviet coal mine enterprises. The main content of this experience is to organize the coal mining work surface to carry out regular operations with one cycle per day and night, improve coal mining efficiency, and establish a normal production order in the mine by compiling and implementing accurate technical operating procedures and establishing and implementing a complete set of management systems. After this experience was promoted in the one-meter thick coal seam of Ping'an Mine of Fuxin Mining Bureau, a set of practical methods was created.

    煤炭工业部奖励四个推广先进经验有成绩的煤矿
    东北煤矿70％以上工作面将推行正规循环作业
    在最近举行的东北煤矿先进经验交流会议上，有4个推广先进经验有成绩的煤矿受到了煤炭工业部的奖励。这4个单位是：阜新矿务局平安矿、鸡西矿务局麻山矿、滴道矿和抚顺矿务局龙凤矿。
    平安矿从1954年起学习苏联煤矿基层管理的先进经验，在采煤和掘进方面都实行了循环图表正规作业。麻山矿和滴道矿，从1955年起推行平安矿采煤正规循环作业先进经验并且推行了一班采煤制等经验。龙凤矿也积极学习了苏联基洛夫矿井的生产管理方法，推行了小型机械化等。这4个矿井1955年的各项指标，都超过了国家规定的计划。

    东北地区的煤矿，今年将在70％以上的工作面推行阜新矿务局平安矿一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验。今年推行这一经验的工作面的产量，预计将比计划提高10％以上。
    正规循环作业是苏联煤矿企业基层单位组织生产的先进经验。这一经验的主要内容是，用编制和贯彻准确的技术作业规程，以及建立和执行一套完整的管理制度的办法，来组织采煤工作面进行一昼夜一次循环的正规作业，提高采煤效率，建立矿井的正常生产秩序。这一经验在阜新矿务局平安矿的一公尺层场子上推广以后，创造了一套切实可行的办法。
