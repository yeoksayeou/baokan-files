China's Scientific and Technological Cooperation with the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
Deputy Director of the Technology Cooperation Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China, Wang Dongnian

Scientific and technological cooperation is one of the main contents of friendly cooperation between countries in the socialist camp. It plays an important role in promoting the common economic prosperity and the development of science and technology in the socialist camp.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, China immediately began scientific and technological cooperation with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. At present, China has signed scientific and technological cooperation agreements with eight countries, namely the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania.

In the past few years, scientific and technological cooperation between China and its fraternal countries has developed significantly. The content and scale of cooperation have also become increasingly extensive. Currently, it not only involves the mutual supply of technical data, the dispatch of experts to provide technical assistance and introduce achievements in science and technology, but also design appraisal, technical consultation, commissioned technical research, mutual acceptance of researchers and interns to conduct research and internships in each other's countries, and mutual cooperation in conducting special research on science and technology, and so on.

In China's scientific and technological cooperation with fraternal countries, the Soviet Union's scientific and technological assistance to China occupies the most important position. In addition to helping China build a large number of modern industrial enterprises, sending a large number of experts to China to provide on-site assistance, and accepting a large number of Chinese interns to practice in the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union also provided China with huge technical assistance in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement. This mainly includes providing China with design data for the construction of smelting plants, ore dressing plants, petroleum factories, power stations, locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing and repair factories, and other construction projects; providing working drawings for the manufacture of rolling mills, water turbines, water pumps, mining cranes, ore loaders, drilling equipment, electric shovels, metal cutting machine tools, locomotives, and other various machines and electrical equipment; and providing process data for the production of high-quality steel, film equipment, vacuum instruments, paints, enamels, pigments, and other various industrial products.

European fraternal countries have also provided us with great assistance in coal industry, petroleum industry, metallurgical industry, machine manufacturing and transportation, post and telecommunications, construction, agriculture and other aspects, according to their scientific and technological cooperation agreements with China.

The above assistance has played a huge role when applied to China's economic construction. This is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

First, it has greatly accelerated the speed of China's socialist industrialization. China's first five-year plan stipulates that the total industrial output value will increase by an average of 14.7% per year. Such a rate of industrial development is very fast. Our ability to achieve such a fast rate of development is inseparable from the assistance of fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union. This assistance has helped us overcome the difficulty of lacking technical strength.

Secondly, it has improved the quality of projects and products, and saved manpower and material resources, and reduced costs. For example, the water pumps produced according to the technical data supplied by the Soviet Union reduced working hours by 56.7% compared with the old water pumps, saved tools by 50%, and reduced costs by 57.5%. The economic benefits generated by the use of these data are of great help to the further development of China's industrial production.

Thirdly, it has helped China train technical personnel. The fraternal countries accepting and training a large number of Chinese interns can generally train them into excellent technical talents in a short period of time. The experts sent to China to help with their work, while completing their own work tasks, unreservedly taught their technology to Chinese workers and engineering personnel. The technical data supplied to China by the fraternal countries, in addition to helping us overcome current difficulties, has also become a valuable material for China to train technical personnel, which has a profound impact on the improvement of China's scientific and technological level.

At the same time, China has also provided some technical data on textiles, light industry, handicrafts, agriculture, water conservancy, construction and medicine, as well as plant seeds and seedlings, etc., to fraternal countries. Since these are the experiences created and accumulated by the Chinese working people over many years, the fraternal countries are very interested in them. After they obtained these data and promoted their use, they also played a certain role in their production. In addition, we have also sent some technicians to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Mongolian People's Republic, and accepted their interns.

China's scientific and technological cooperation with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. It embodies the desire for sincere cooperation and mutual assistance to achieve common economic prosperity. The mutual supply of technical data between countries in the socialist camp is free of charge (except for the cost of design and drawings). This is fundamentally different from the situation in which technically advanced capitalist countries use this to earn high profits. For example, the price paid by West Germany for American patents reached a huge US$160 million in 1954 alone, a sum that accounted for more than a quarter of West Germany's total income from exports to the United States.

In China's scientific and technological cooperation with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, the fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union, always help us as much as possible. They not only unreservedly introduce us to the technical experience they have accumulated over a long period of time according to our requirements; but also help us carefully consider whether the requirements we have put forward have any omissions, and even actively introduce us to their own technological achievements so that we can choose from them. Although China's scientific and technological level is not high, it has also made great efforts to meet the requirements of the fraternal countries.

Now China's first five-year plan has entered its fourth year. In order to ensure the smooth and early overfulfillment of the national construction plan and promote the common economic prosperity of the socialist camp, in addition to our own efforts in all aspects, we must further strengthen China's scientific and technological cooperation with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, so as to more effectively learn from the experience of building socialism in the fraternal countries.

Our task in the future is, on the one hand, to make full use of the scientific and technological cooperation relations that China has already established with the fraternal countries, so that we can obtain timely technical assistance when we encounter difficult technical problems in the implementation of the national plan. On the other hand, we must also recognize that the technical experience provided to us by the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries is the result of many years of labor by the workers, scientists and engineers of their countries; and that their assistance to us is carried out by drawing strength from their tense communist and socialist construction. Therefore, we should cherish and make full use of the technical assistance they provide. At the same time, we must also realize that China's scientific and technological cooperation with fraternal countries is carried out on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Undertaking and fulfilling the requirements put forward by the other party is China's unshirkable international obligation. Therefore, we must proactively and systematically organize China's many excellent technical experiences in the same way as we strive for technical assistance from fraternal countries, so as to supply them to the fraternal countries in a timely manner.

    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家间的科学技术合作
    中华人民共和国对外贸易部技术合作局副局长　王东年
    科学技术合作是社会主义阵营各国友好合作的主要内容之一。它在促进社会主义阵营各国经济的共同高涨和科学技术的发展方面起着重要的作用。
    中华人民共和国成立之后，我国立即开始同苏联和各人民民主国家进行科学技术合作。现在，我国已经分别和苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚等8个国家签订了科学技术合作协定。
    过去几年来，我国和各兄弟国家间的科学技术合作有了显著的发展。合作的内容和规模也日益广泛。目前不仅相互供应技术资料，派遣专家以进行技术援助和介绍科学技术方面的成就，并且还进行设计鉴定、技术咨询、委托技术研究、互相接受研究员和实习人员在对方国家进行研究实习，以及相互合作从事科学技术的专题研究，等等。
    在我国同各兄弟国家的科学技术合作中，苏联对我国的科学技术援助占有最重要的地位。苏联除帮助我国建设大批近代化的工业企业，派遣大批专家来我国实地帮助、接受我国大批实习生到苏联实习外，还根据中苏科学技术合作协定，给了我国巨大的技术援助。主要是供给我国关于建设冶炼工厂、选矿工厂、石油工厂、发电站、机车车辆制造工厂和修理工厂以及其他建设工程的设计资料；供给制造压延机、水轮机、水泵、矿山起重机、矿石装载机、钻探装置、电铲、金属切削机床、机车以及其他各种机器和电器设备的工作图纸；供给生产优质钢材、电影设备、真空仪器、油漆、磁漆、颜料以及其他各种工业产品的工艺资料等。
    欧洲各兄弟国家也根据它们同我国的科学技术合作协定，在煤炭工业、石油工业、冶金工业、机器制造和交通、邮电、建筑、农业等方面给了我们很大帮助。
    以上援助，运用在我国的经济建设事业中，已发挥了巨大的作用。这主要表现以下几个方面：
    首先是大大地加快了我国社会主义工业化的速度。在我国第一个五年计划中规定，工业总产值将平均每年递增14.7％，这样的工业发展速度是很快的。我们能有这样快的发展速度，这是同兄弟国家首先是苏联的援助分不开的。这些援助帮助我们克服了技术力量缺乏的困难。
    其次是提高了工程和产品的质量，并节省了人力物力，降低了成本。例如依据苏联供给的技术资料而生产的水泵，比旧型水泵工时消耗降低56.7％，工具节省50％，成本降低了57.5％。使用这些资料所产生的经济效果，对于进一步发展我国的工业生产是有很大帮助的。
    再次是帮助我国培养了技术力量。各兄弟国家接受培养我国的大批实习生，一般都能在短期内训练成为优秀的技术人才。派来我国帮助工作的专家们，在完成自己工作任务的同时，并毫无保留地把他们的技术传授给我国的工人和工程人员。各兄弟国家供给我国的技术资料，除帮助我们克服了当前的困难外，还成了我国培养技术力量的宝贵材料，这对我国科学技术水平的提高有着深远的影响。
    与此同时我国也对各兄弟国家提供了一部分有关纺织、轻工业、手工业、农业、水利、建筑和医药等方面的技术资料以及植物种子，苗木等。由于这些都是我国劳动人民许多年来的创造和积累起来的经验，各兄弟国家对此都是很感兴趣的。在他们取得这些资料并推广使用之后，对他们的生产事业也起了一定的作用。此外，我们还向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和蒙古人民共和国派出了一部分技术人员和接受了他们的实习生。
    我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的科学技术合作，是建立在平等互惠的原则之上的，它体现了彼此真诚合作和互相帮助以达到经济共同高涨的愿望。社会主义阵营各国之间互相供应技术资料是不付代价的（除了收取设计和图纸的费用）。这同那些技术先进的资本主义国家借此赚取高额利润的情形有着根本的区别。例如，西德为美国的专利权而支付的代价，在1954年一年内就达到了16，000万美元之巨，这个数目占西德对美国输出所得的全部收入的四分之一以上。
    在我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的科学技术合作中，各兄弟国家，尤其是苏联，总是尽可能地帮助我们。它们不仅根据我们的要求，把长期积累起来的技术经验，毫无保留地介绍给我们；并且还帮助我们周密地考虑所提要求有无遗漏，甚至还主动向我们介绍自己的技术成就以便让我们从中选择。我国科学技术水平虽然不高，但也作了极大的努力来满足各兄弟国家的要求。
    现在我国第一个五年计划已经进入了第四年，为了保证顺利地和提前超额地完成国家建设计划并促进社会主义阵营各国经济的共同高涨，我们除了自己在各方面努力之外，还必须进一步加强我国同苏联和各人民民主国家间的科学技术合作，以便更有效地向各兄弟国家学习建设社会主义的经验。
    我们今后的任务是，一方面应当充分利用我国已经同各兄弟国家建立起来了的科学技术合作关系，以便在执行国家计划中遇到难以解决的技术问题时，及时取得技术援助。另一方面，我们也必须认识到：苏联和各人民民主国家提供给我们的技术经验，都是他们国家的工人、科学家和工程人员许多年来的劳动结晶；而他们对我们的援助，又是在他们正在紧张地进行共产主义和社会主义建设的情况下，抽出力量来进行的。因此，我们应当十分珍惜和充分利用他们所给予的技术援助。同时，我们还必须认识到我国同各兄弟国家间的科学技术合作是在平等互惠基础上进行的。承担和完成对方提出的要求，是我国义不容辞的国际义务。因此，我们必须和争取兄弟国家的技术援助那样，主动地有计划地把我国许多优良的技术经验进行系统的整理，以便及时供给各兄弟国家。
