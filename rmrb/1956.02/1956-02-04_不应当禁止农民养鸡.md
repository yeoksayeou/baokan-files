    Farmers Should Not Be Prohibited from Raising Chickens
    Recently, in rural areas of Jintan, Jiangdu, Huaiyin, Suqian and other counties in Jiangsu Province, a widespread phenomenon of prohibiting chicken raising and mass slaughtering of chickens has occurred.
    Some township cadres in these areas unilaterally believed that raising chickens was harmful to agricultural production increase, and they arbitrarily restricted farmers from raising chickens. Many agricultural cooperatives wrongly stipulated that each member household was only allowed to raise one or two chickens. The head of Liangdu Township in Lujin District, Jiangdu County, announced at a township residents' meeting: "From now on, each farm household is only allowed to raise three chickens, and the excess chickens must be slaughtered or sold off completely within three days." Afterwards, village cadres conducted inspections and arbitrarily went to farmers' homes to kill chickens. Many farmers had to reluctantly slaughter or sell large numbers of hens, or take them to relatives' homes to be raised.
    Prohibiting farmers from raising chickens is wrong. Party and government leading organs in these areas should conduct inspections on this matter and promptly stop the erroneous behavior of village cadres in restricting farmers from raising chickens.

    不应当禁止农民养鸡
    近来江苏省的金坛、江都、淮阴、宿迁等县农村中，普遍发生了禁止养鸡和大量杀鸡的现象。
    这些地区的一些乡干部片面地认为养鸡对农业增产有害，便擅自限制农民养鸡。许多农业合作社错误地规定：每户社员只准养一至二只鸡。江都县路筋区两渡乡乡长曾在乡民大会上宣布：“以后每户农家只准养三只鸡，多余的鸡限三天内全部杀光或卖掉。”事后乡村干部们进行了检查，随便到农民家里去打鸡杀鸡。许多农民不得不忍痛把大批母鸡杀掉、卖掉，或者拿到亲戚家去留养。
    禁止农民养鸡是错误的。这些地区的党政领导机关应该对这件事进行检查，迅速制止乡村干部限制农民养鸡的错误行为。
