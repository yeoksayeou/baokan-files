Why Not Boldly Promote Engineering and Technical Personnel
By Our Reporter Chen Ji

    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant plans to produce its first batch of automobiles before October 1st this year. To achieve this plan, it is necessary not only to prepare well for production, but also to cultivate and equip a sufficient number of engineering and technical personnel.

    According to preliminary statistics, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant still lacks more than 290 engineers before it can be fully put into production. What policy should be adopted to fill such a large number of engineers? Some people advocate asking the central government for them; others advocate relying on their own strength to solve the problem. Those who advocate asking the central government for them obviously do not consider how to give full play to the strength of existing engineering and technical personnel.

    Can the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant give full play to its existing strength to make up for the shortage of engineers? Absolutely. In the past few years, the Party and the government have transferred a large number of outstanding engineering and technical personnel from all over the country to work at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Now the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant already has more than 90 engineers and more than 1,300 technicians. Among the more than 1,300 technicians, there are 144 technicians above the third grade and 385 college graduates before 1953. The vast majority of technicians are energetic, hardworking, and rapidly progressing outstanding young people. Some of them have already undertaken the work of engineers, and some can undertake the work of engineers after training and practice. If these technicians are cultivated and promoted as soon as possible, they will not only be able to make up for the shortage of engineers, but also cultivate more engineers to support other factories. However, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has not promoted a single engineer from among the technicians in the two years since its establishment. And none of the more than 90 engineers have been promoted.

    Is it that these engineering and technical personnel are not progressing fast enough and do not yet meet the conditions for promotion and advancement? No. Some technicians who should have been promoted long ago have not been promoted; some engineers who should have been advanced long ago have not been advanced. For example, Lv Yanbin, a technician in the design department, graduated from university in 1948 and was already a first-grade technician as early as 1952. He once led the design of automobile bodies and achieved great success. Many people believe that Lv Yanbin should be promoted to a fourth-grade engineer; however, Lv Yanbin is still a first-grade technician. Li Longtian, who participated in the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism for Young People, not only works actively and studies hard, but also his technology has reached the level of a fourth-grade engineer, but he has not been promoted. As early as the first half of last year, some people advocated promoting more than 10 technicians who met the conditions, like Lv Yanbin, to engineers. But at that time, some people opposed it, saying that they would wait and see. These people who advocate waiting and seeing are the ones who are shouting today that there is still a shortage of more than 290 engineers and are reaching out to higher authorities to request more engineers.

    Some engineering and technical personnel, although they do not yet meet the conditions for promotion, will grow up quickly as long as they are planned and helped. However, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has long lacked specific plans and measures in the past, and its cultivation and assistance to them have been insufficient, which has hindered the faster growth of new forces among engineering and technical personnel.

    Why has the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant been slow to cultivate and promote engineering and technical personnel? The fundamental reason is that the Party organization and administrative departments of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have not fully recognized the role of engineering and technical personnel in China's industrial construction, have not clearly seen the great progress of China's engineering and technical personnel in the past few years, and have not launched a vigorous criticism and struggle against the right-leaning conservative ideas of some leading Party workers.

    People with right-leaning conservative ideas have a completely incorrect understanding of engineering and technical personnel, saying that they "progress very slowly." This is not in line with the general situation. The progress of the vast majority of engineering and technical personnel is relatively fast. Among the more than one thousand engineering and technical personnel, more than 80% are actively working, diligently studying advanced Soviet experience, and conscientiously implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. Many engineers feel that their technology cannot keep up with the needs of the country, and they are eagerly studying Russian and learning advanced Soviet science and technology; some people work hard during the day and study late into the night; some people immediately go everywhere to buy Soviet magazines as soon as they hear that important scientific papers have been published. Wu Jingye, director of the process department, said: "Our work should have been a relay race. The Soviet Stalin Automobile Factory has run the most difficult part of the road for us, sending us adjusted machine tools and complete sets of process data; we should take over and quickly run the entire section of the road to produce cars. But we don't know how to run, and we can't run fast. So we must learn and catch up." Wu Jingye is now not only leading the work of the process department well, but also diligently studying technology. Like Wu Jingye, many engineering and technical personnel are preparing to strive to catch up with the advanced level of modern industrial technology and produce domestic cars as early as possible in a relay race. Cao Cunchang, an engineer in the gearbox workshop, took the initiative to take on apprentices and launched a competition for engineering and technical personnel to complete the Five-Year Plan three quarters ahead of schedule. Engineering and technical personnel in various departments and workshops have successively formulated their personal two-year plans as goals for struggle. Some Party members were moved to say when they saw engineering and technical personnel working so hard: "Our study of business and technology is far inferior to that of engineering and technical personnel. We must learn from them." Faced with these vivid facts, how can we say that engineering and technical personnel are progressing slowly? However, people with right-leaning conservative ideas have drawn completely wrong conclusions from these vivid facts, saying: "This is a purely technical point of view." Is it not a noble manifestation of patriotism to work hard to learn technology in order for the motherland to be able to manufacture automobiles independently? Is it not the lofty political task of our engineering and technical personnel to strive to improve the level of industrial technology in our country and eliminate the backward state of our technology? Even if some engineering and technical personnel have a tendency not to care about politics, there have been significant changes in the past few years. Many engineering and technical personnel have deeply felt the greatness of the Party in their actual work and urgently demand to study Marxist-Leninist theory. Some engineers take the initiative to ask the Party for help and criticism and consciously study the Party's policies. There are also 13 engineers who have applied to join the Party but have not yet been admitted by the Party organization. Do all these facts indicate that the progress of engineering and technical personnel is slow? Or is it that the thinking of some of our Party organizations and administrative leaders is lagging behind reality? Isn't this very obvious?

    Precisely because of right-leaning conservative ideas, we are timid and not bold enough in the work of cultivating and promoting engineering and technical personnel. A director said: "A 1950 college graduate will be promoted to the head of the technical section, which is called forced growth." In fact, he does not see that although the technical member who was promoted to section chief does not have enough revolutionary experience, his professional ability, political awareness, and technical level are competent for the technical section chief. Since he is competent, how can it be called "forced growth"? The reason why this director said this is because he does not dare to use cadres out of line, for fear of breaking the rules. People who hold the same view as this director are not isolated cases in the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant must thoroughly criticize the conservative ideas about the use of technical talents, earnestly implement the plans that have been made, and boldly cultivate and promote engineering and technical personnel. Only by adopting such a policy can we solve the current difficulty of lacking engineering and technical personnel, and can we cultivate more new technical talents to meet the needs of this factory's production development and the needs of national socialist construction.

    为什么不大胆提拔工程技术人员
    本报记者　陈迹
    第一汽车制造厂计划在今年10月1日以前制造出第一批汽车来。要实现这个计划，不但要做好生产的准备工作，而且要培养和配备好足够数量的工程技术人员。
    根据现在初步统计，第一汽车制造厂在全面投入生产前，还缺少290多名工程师。要想配足这样多数量的工程师，应该采取什么方针呢？有的人主张向中央要；有的人主张依靠自己力量来解决。主张向中央要的人，显然没有考虑如何充分发挥现有工程技术人员力量的问题。
    第一汽车制造厂能不能充分发挥现有力量，来补足所缺少的工程师呢？完全能够。几年来，党和政府曾经从国内各地抽调大批优秀的工程技术人员，到第一汽车制造厂工作。现在第一汽车制造厂已经拥有90多名工程师和1，300多名技术员。在1，300多名技术员中，有144名三级以上的技术员和385名1953年以前毕业的大学生。绝大部分技术员都是朝气勃勃、努力学习、进步飞快的优秀青年。他们之中，有些已经担负了工程师的工作，有些经过培养和锻炼以后也能担负工程师的工作。如果及早地培养和提拔这些技术员，不但完全能够补足工程师的缺额，而且还可以培养出更多的工程师支援别的工厂。但是第一汽车制造厂建厂两年多来，却没有从技术员中间提拔一个工程师。而90多名工程师也没有一个晋级的。
    是不是这些工程技术人员进步不快，还不具备提拔和晋级的条件呢？不是的。有些早应该提升的技术员，未能提升；有些早应该晋级的工程师，也未晋级。例如设计处技术员吕彦斌是1948年毕业的大学生，早在1952年就是一级技术员，曾经领导过汽车车身的设计，获得很大的成功。许多人认为吕彦斌应该提拔为四级工程师；但是，吕彦斌至今还是一级技术员。参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的李龙天，不但积极工作，努力学习，而且他的技术也达到了四级工程师的水平，但他也没有得到提升。早在去年上半年，有人就主张提拔10多名像吕彦斌这样合乎条件的技术员为工程师。但是当时有人反对，说要等一等再说。这些主张等一等的人，就是今天叫喊还缺少290多名工程师，伸手向上级要求增加工程师的人。
    有些工程技术人员，现在虽然还不够提升的条件，但只要有计划地加以培养和帮助，也会很快地成长起来。但是第一汽车制造厂过去长期地缺乏具体的规划和措施，对他们的培养和帮助是很不够的，这就妨碍着工程技术人员中新生力量更快的成长。
    为什么第一汽车制造厂迟迟不培养和提拔工程技术人员呢？根本的原因，在于第一汽车制造厂党组织和行政部门没有充分地认识到我国工程技术人员在工业建设中的作用，没有清楚地看到我国工程技术人员几年来的巨大进步，对于党内一些领导工作人员的右倾保守思想，没有展开有力的批判和斗争。
    具有右倾保守思想的人对工程技术人员有一种完全不正确的认识，说他们：“进步得很慢。”这是不符合一般情况的。绝大部分工程技术人员的进步是比较快的。在一千多名工程技术人员中，有80％以上是积极工作，努力学习苏联先进经验，认真执行苏联专家建议的。不少工程师感到自己在技术上赶不上国家的需要，如饥如渴地学习俄文，学习苏联的先进科学技术；有的人白天紧张工作，深夜还在学习；有些人一听说苏联杂志上发表了重要的科学论文，就马上到处去购买。工艺处处长吴敬业说：“我们的工作，本来应该是接力赛跑。苏联斯大林汽车工厂为我们跑完一段最困难的路程，给我们送来调整好的机床和成套工艺资料；我们应该接上去，赶快跑完全段路程，制出汽车。但我们不会跑，跑不快。所以必须学习，追赶上去。”吴敬业现在不但很好地领导着工艺处的工作，而且刻苦地努力研究技术。许多工程技术人员和吴敬业一样，以接力赛跑的姿态，准备努力追上现代工业技术的先进水平，提早制造出国产汽车。变速箱车间工程师曹存昌主动要求带徒弟，并且发动工程技术人员开展竞赛，要提前三个季度完成五年计划。各处、各车间的工程技术人员，都纷纷制定个人的两年规划，作为奋斗的目标。有些党员同志看到工程技术人员这样努力学习，都感动地说：“我们学习业务，学习技术，远远不如工程技术人员。我们要向他们学习。”面对着这些活生生的事实，怎么能说工程技术人员进步的慢呢？但是，具有右倾保守思想的人却对这些活生生的事实作出了完全错误的结论，他们说：“这是单纯技术观点”。为了祖国能独立地制造汽车而努力学习技术，难道不是高尚的爱国主义的表现吗？努力提高我国工业技术水平，消灭我国技术上落后的状态，难道这不是我国工程技术人员崇高的政治任务吗？纵然有些工程技术人员有着不过问政治的倾向，但在这几年中也有了显著的变化。许多工程技术人员在实际工作中深深地感到党的伟大，迫切要求学习马克思列宁主义理论。有些工程师主动地要求党的帮助和批评，自觉地学习党的政策。还有13名工程师要求入党，至今没有被党组织吸收。所有这些事实，究竟是说明工程技术人员的进步慢呢？还是我们某些党组织和行政的领导人员的思想落后于实际呢？这不是十分明显吗？
    正因为有着右倾保守思想，所以在培养和提拔工程技术人员的工作中，就缩手缩脚，不够大胆。一位处长说：“1950年的大学毕业生，就要提升为技术科长，这叫做拔苗助长。”其实，他看不见这位被提拔为科长的技术员，虽然革命经历不够，但业务能力、政治觉悟和技术水平，是能够胜任技术科长的。既然能够胜任，怎么能说成是“拔苗助长”呢？这位处长所以要这样说，是因为他不敢破格使用干部，生怕打破了常规。同这位处长抱着一样看法的人，在第一汽车制造厂，还不是个别的。
    第一汽车制造厂必须彻底批判对于使用技术人才的保守思想，切实贯彻已做出的规划，大胆地培养和提拔工程技术人员。只有采取这样的方针，才能解决目前缺少工程技术人员的困难，才能培养出更多的新的技术人才来，以适应这个厂的生产发展的需要和国家社会主义建设的需要。
