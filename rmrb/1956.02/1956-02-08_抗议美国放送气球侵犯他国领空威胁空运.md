Xinhua News Agency, February 7th dispatch from Moscow: Soviet Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Mr. Zorin, paid a visit to Deputy Foreign Minister Hallstein of the Federal Republic of Germany on February 6th, delivering a note from the Soviet government regarding the issue of American military agencies using the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany to release balloons into Soviet airspace. The note pointed out: The Soviet government already brought this issue to the attention of Federal Chancellor Adenauer during talks with the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany in Moscow in September 1955. At that time, Chancellor Adenauer stated that the Federal government could take corresponding measures and also promised to consult with the American government on this issue. However, the activities of releasing balloons from the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany into Soviet airspace have not only not stopped, but have recently become more frequent.
    The Soviet government believes that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany should be held responsible for the illegal actions of American agencies using the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany to grossly violate Soviet airspace and clearly threaten the safety of air transport and human lives. The Soviet government firmly demands that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany take urgent and effective measures to stop such intolerable behavior of using the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany for similar activities.
    Bulgaria Protests US for Sending Balloons Threatening Airspace
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Sofia, February 4th: Recently, a large number of balloons moving from the northwest to the southeast were discovered over the territory of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. These balloons are made in the United States and are equipped with photographic and radio equipment, as well as slanderous leaflets. Judging from the direction of the balloons' movement and their technical equipment, they were released from West Germany and are intended for reconnaissance over the territory of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The large number of these balloons poses a serious threat to normal air transport in Bulgarian airspace.
    Therefore, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, entrusted by the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, has lodged a protest with the US government through the Swiss Legation in Sofia, and has written to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, pointing out that this behavior is incompatible with the principles of international cooperation and with the obligations assumed by the US government under the Charter of the United Nations.
    Balloons Blown to Britain Cause Unease
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from London, February 4th: According to newspaper reports, three balloons suspending a large number of leaflets landed in Lewisham in southern England, Pinner (Middlesex County), and Farnborough (Kent County). It is speculated that these three balloons were released in West Germany by the American organization "Crusade for Freedom" with the aim of spreading hostile leaflets to Eastern European countries. The balloons were blown to Britain by the wind.
    The appearance of balloons over Britain, which has a dense network of airports, has caused extreme unease among British air transport workers.
    Czechoslovakia Exhibits US-Made Balloons
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Prague: Parts of balloons from the "Radio Free Europe" broadcasting station were exhibited at an exhibition held in Prague on January 28th. The various parts of these balloons are made in the United States and bear American trademarks. In particular, the mechanical device that can distribute up to 150 kilograms of slanderous leaflets is also made in the United States.
    Since last week, a large number of "Radio Free Europe" broadcasting station's balloons of various shapes and sizes released from bases in West Germany have floated over Czechoslovakia. In the past week alone, more than 500 balloons landed in three states of Slovakia.
    These balloons, with diameters ranging from 12 meters to 15 meters, are filled with more than 1,700 cubic meters of hydrogen gas, which is harmful to the lives and property of Czechoslovak citizens. On January 26, one balloon that exploded in Slovakia injured six people.
    Due to these balloons, aircraft from some foreign airlines have had to suspend flights under certain dangerous circumstances.
    The people of Czechoslovakia expressed great indignation and condemned this criminal act instigated by the US ruling clique.

    抗议美国放送气球侵犯他国领空威胁空运
    苏联照会西德政府要求制止美国利用西德领土放送气球
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联驻德意志联邦共和国大使佐林2月6日拜会了德意志联邦共和国外交部副部长哈尔斯坦，交给他苏联政府照会一件，照会的内容是关于美国军事机构利用德意志联邦共和国的领土向苏联领空放出气球的问题。照会指出：苏联政府在1955年9月同德意志联邦共和国政府代表团在莫斯科会谈期间就已经提请联邦总理阿登纳注意这个问题。当时，阿登纳总理表示，联邦政府可以采取相应的措施，并且还答应将就这一问题同美国政府磋商。然而，从德意志联邦共和国领土放出气球到苏联领土上空的活动不仅没有停止，而且最近还越来越多了。
    苏联政府认为，德意志联邦共和国政府应对美国机关利用德意志联邦共和国领土进行粗暴的侵犯苏联领空和明显地威胁空运安全和人命的非法行为一事负责。苏联政府坚决要求德意志联邦共和国政府采取紧急的有效措施，以制止利用德意志联邦共和国领土进行类似的不可容忍的行为。
    保加利亚抗议美国放送气球威胁领空
    新华社讯　塔斯社索非亚4日电：最近在保加利亚人民共和国领土上空发现了自西北方向东南方运动的大量气球。这些气球是美国制造的，上面装有摄影和无线电设备，以及诬蔑性的传单。从气球运动的方向和它们的技术设备看来，它们是从西德发放的，并且是用来到保加利亚人民共和国领土上空进行侦察的。大量的这种气球对保加利亚领空的正常空运造成了严重威胁。
    为此，保加利亚外交部受保加利亚人民共和国政府委托，通过瑞士驻索非亚公使馆向美国政府提出了抗议，并且写信给联合国秘书长，指出这种行为是同国际合作的原则、同美国政府根据联合国宪章所承担的义务不相容的。
    气球吹到英国引起不安
    新华社讯　塔斯社伦敦4日电：据报纸消息，在英国南部路易斯海姆、皮涅尔（米德尔塞克斯郡）和法恩堡柔（肯特郡）降落了3个悬挂有大批传单的气球。据推测，这3个气球是美国组织“争取自由十字军”在西德放出的，目的是向东欧国家散布含有敌视的传单。气球被风吹到英国。
    气球出现在有着密布飞机场的英国上空引起了英国航空运输工作人员的极其不安。
    捷展出美制气球
    新华社布拉格讯　1月28日在布拉格举行的一个展览会上展出了“自由欧洲”广播台的气球的各个部分。这些气球的各个部分都是美国制造的，上面有美国商标，特别是可以散发重达150公斤的诬蔑性传单的机械装置也是美国制造的。
    上星期以来，从西德基地放出的形状和大小不同的大量的“自由欧洲”广播台的气球飘到了捷克斯洛伐克上空。单是在上星期就有500多个气球落在斯洛伐克的3个州内。
    直径从12公尺到15公尺的这些气球装有1，700多立方公尺的对捷克斯洛伐克公民的生命财产有危害的氢气。1月26日在斯洛伐克爆炸的1个气球炸伤了6个人。
    由于这些气球，一些外国航空公司的飞机不得不在某些危险的情况下停航。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民表示极大愤慨，斥责美国统治集团主使的这种罪恶行动。
