	Encourage Learning from Advanced Producers

	On January 31, the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions held a conference to congratulate Su Guangming, a milling worker at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and Zhang Zhigui, a fitter, on comprehensively completing the workload of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Party committee secretaries and factory directors of some state-owned and local state-owned factories in Harbin, as well as trade union chairmen, model workers, and advanced producers from various factories, attended the conference. At the meeting, Wu Tongfu, Director of the Industrial Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, read the congratulatory letter from the Municipal Committee to Su Guangming and Zhang Zhigui; the Harbin Municipal People's Committee awarded them the honorary title of "Labor Model."
	Su Guangming and Zhang Zhigui have many advanced deeds worth learning from. Su Guangming has not produced a single defective product in six years, has not had a single mechanical accident, and has not been absent from work once in five years. Zhang Zhigui has not produced a single defective product in the past three years, has not been absent from work once, and has not had a single accident. Although they are both veteran workers with rich practical experience of one or two decades, they are not complacent. In their work, they continue to actively learn and study new technologies, and constantly promote and learn advanced experience. In recent years, the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has successively learned and promoted advanced experiences from the Soviet Union, such as high-speed cutting, assembly line operations, multi-machine management, corn milling cutters, and Zhuang Minggeng's work method in China. Su Guangming and Zhang Zhigui are both people who take the lead in promoting and learning. In April 1955, Zhang Zhigui's team received a large number of production tasks for manufacturing cold steel wheel templates and several tools for wheel inspection. Among them, the work quota for manufacturing cold steel wheel templates had already been reduced from 6 hours in the past to 3.42 minutes. Many people were worried that they would not be able to complete the task on time. Zhang Zhigui found the applicable departmental operation and assembly line method from the Soviet operation experience promoted in other workshops of the factory. When these methods were vigorously promoted in the factory, their team was doing scattered work and was not promoted, but now that they are doing a lot of work, they can use it. After promotion, it only takes 2.10 minutes to manufacture a cold steel wheel template. In June 1955, Zhuang Minggeng, the "Glorious Railway Worker," came to the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory to promote advanced experience. Some fitters thought that the "needle-free alignment method" and "multi-knife multi-blade method" he introduced were not useful to them and were not interested. However, Zhang Zhigui, based on the characteristics of the fitter, learned from him the experience of shortening auxiliary working hours, and shortened the auxiliary working hours of various products by half.
	Like Su Guangming and Zhang Zhigui, there are workers in every region and every enterprise who humbly learn from advanced producers and strive to catch up with the advanced. In the upsurge of the socialist revolution, there will be more and more such workers. Party organizations, administrative leaders, and relevant leading organs of enterprises should pay close attention to discovering and rewarding those who actively learn advanced experience, advanced technology, and strive to catch up with advanced producers; and should not only pay attention to praising a few people who have achievements in inventions. In this way, we can further encourage employees and engineering and technical personnel to learn from advanced producers, expand the influence of advanced producers, and give full play to the effectiveness of advanced experience, advanced work methods, and advanced technologies. The situation in Harbin also illustrates this point. Less than 10 days after the conference celebrating Su Guangming and Zhang Zhigui's early completion of the Five-Year Plan, another team and two other workers at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory completed the workload of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule; 64 people guaranteed to complete the Five-Year Plan more than a year in advance. At the second representative conference of advanced workers and rationalization proposers held in this factory on February 5, another 27 advanced production teams and 168 advanced producers were rewarded. Six production teams in the Harbin Flax Textile Factory completed two days of work in one day. Song Shufang and Wei Shoufang, female workers in the wet spinning roving section of the weaving workshop, used to watch 25 spindles each, but now they watch 50 spindles. The joint carding machine workers have expanded from watching two machines per person to watching four machines per person. Expanding the number of machines watched has become a loud slogan in this factory. The factory originally planned to increase 1,200 workers in 1956, but now, due to the improvement of labor efficiency and the improvement of labor organization, only 380 people are needed. After the workers in the wet spinning section increased the number of machines watched, they can open another work shift without increasing the number of people. Zhang Wanren, a young turner at the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory, has completed the workload of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule due to continuous improvement of tools and technology. Recently, he has increased from mastering 8 knives to 12 knives, increasing cutting efficiency by 30%. Through the joint efforts of all employees, the Metal Structure Company of the Construction Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has doubled the production efficiency of steel frames.

    鼓励向先进生产者学习

    1月31日，哈尔滨市工会联合会召开大会，祝贺哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂铣工苏广铭、钳工张执贵全面地提前完成第一个五年计划的工作量。哈尔滨市部分国营、地方国营工厂的党委书记、厂长和各工厂的工会主席、劳动模范、先进生产者都参加了大会。在会上，中共哈尔滨市委工业部部长武通甫同志宣读了市委给苏广铭、张执贵的贺信；哈尔滨市人民委员会授予他们以“劳动模范”的光荣称号。
    苏广铭和张执贵有很多先进的事迹值得学习。苏广铭六年来没出过一件废品，没发生过一次机械事故，五年来没欠过一次勤。张执贵在过去三年中也没出过一件废品，没欠过一次勤，没发生过一次事故。他们虽然都是具有丰富实际经验的一、二十年工龄的老工人，但是并不自满，在劳动中还是不断地积极学习和钻研新技术，不断地推广和学习先进经验。几年来，哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂先后学习和推广了苏联的快速切削、流水作业、多机台管理、玉米铣刀和国内的庄铭耕工作法等先进经验，苏广铭、张执贵都是带头推广和学习的人。1955年4月，张执贵所在的小组接到大批制造冷钢轮样板和车轮检查器的几种工具的生产任务，其中制造冷钢轮样板的工时定额已经从过去的6小时降低到3点42分钟。许多人都担心不能按期完成任务。张执贵从厂里别的车间推广的苏联作业经验中找到了适用的分部作业、流水作业法。这些方法在厂里组织大力推广的时候，他们小组干的是零星活，没推广，现在做大批活，就用得着了。推广后，制造一只冷钢轮样板只用2点10分钟。1955年6月，“光荣的铁路工作者”庄铭耕到哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂推广先进经验，有些钳工认为他所介绍的“无针找正法”、“多刀多刃法”自己用不上而不感兴趣。张执贵却根据钳工特点，向他学习了缩短辅助工时的经验，把各种产品的辅助工时缩短了二分之一。
    像苏广铭和张执贵一样虚心向先进生产者学习，努力赶上先进的工人，每一个地区、每一个企业都是有的。在社会主义革命的高潮中，这样的工人将越来越多。企业的党组织、行政领导和有关的领导机关，应该十分注意发现和奖励积极学习先进经验、先进技术、努力赶上先进生产者的人；而不要只注意表扬少数在创造发明方面有成就的人。这样就可以进一步鼓励职工群众和工程技术人员向先进生产者学习，扩大先进生产者的影响，充分发挥先进经验、先进工作法、先进技术的效用。哈尔滨市的情况也说明了这一点。在庆祝苏广铭、张执贵提前完成五年计划大会后，不到10天时间，哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂又有一个小组和另外两个工人提前完成了五年计划的工作量；64人保证提前一年多完成五年计划。这个厂在2月5日召开的第二届先进工作者及合理化建议者代表大会上，又有27个先进生产小组、168名先进生产者受到奖励。哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂有6个生产小组一天完成两天工作量，织布场准备车间湿纺落纱工段女工宋淑芳、魏守芳过去每人看25个锭子，现在看50个锭子。联合梳麻机工人每人由看两台扩大到每人看4台。扩大看管机台，已经成为这个工厂的响亮口号。全厂原计划1956年增加1，200个工人，现在由于提高劳动效率，并且改进了劳动组织，只增加380个人就够了。湿纺工段工人增加看机台数量后，不增加人就可以多开一个工作班。哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂青年车工张万任，由于不断改进刀具提高技术，已经提前完成五年计划的工作量。最近，他又从掌握8把刀增加到12把，提高切削效率30％。重工业部建筑工程局金属结构公司，经全体职工共同钻研，提高钢架生产效率一倍。
