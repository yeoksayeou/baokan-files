Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 26th: More than 500 joint state-private factories in Shanghai have participated in inter-factory competitions. The number of participating employees exceeds 140,000, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the total number of employees in the city's joint factories.

The cotton spinning and wool spinning factories, which implemented full industry-wide joint state-private ownership last year, have all participated in the inter-factory competition. Among the newly established joint state-private factories with a scale of 25 people or more, about half of the employees participated in the inter-factory competition. An even greater number of new joint state-private factories have launched competitions within their own factories. In Jiangning District alone, there are more than 300 textile factories engaged in competitions. Among the earlier established joint state-private factories, 29 factories, including Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill, participated in the national inter-factory competition for cotton spinning mills, of which 17 factories proposed to catch up with the level of state-owned factories this year. Many new joint state-private factories have improved labor productivity and product quality in the course of carrying out socialist competitions. The Chenfeng Nib Factory implemented a suggestion put forward by five workers, including Jiang Weifu, which greatly accelerated the speed of the rolling machine. In the past, each person rolled 900 dozens of nib pieces per day, but now they can roll 1,000 dozens per hour. In the weaving industry, the new joint state-private factories participating in the inter-factory competition have recently broken through the quality indicators. Some products of Dagong, Gongtai, and other factories are all first-class products, eliminating defective products.

    上海市五百多个公私合营工厂参加厂际竞赛
    新华社上海26日电　上海市已有500多个公私合营工厂参加了厂际竞赛。参加厂际竞赛的职工共14万多人，约占全市合营工厂职工总数四分之一。
    去年就实行了全行业公私合营的棉纺、毛纺工厂都参加了厂际竞赛。规模在25人以上的新公私合营工厂中，有一半左右的职工参加了厂际竞赛。在本厂范围内开展竞赛的新公私合营厂为数更多，江宁区开展竞赛的纺织厂就有300多个。在公私合营较早的工厂中，申新第九棉纺织厂等29个厂参加了全国棉纺织厂的厂际竞赛，其中有17个厂提出要在今年赶上国营厂的水平。许多新公私合营厂在开展社会主义竞赛中，提高了劳动生产率和产品质量。成丰笔尖厂实行蒋味福等5个工人提出的一项建议，轧片车的车速大大加快，过去每人每天轧制笔尖片900打，现在1小时就轧1，000打。织布业中参加厂际竞赛的新公私合营厂最近都突破了质量指标，大公、公泰等工厂有些产品全部是正品，消灭了残次品。
