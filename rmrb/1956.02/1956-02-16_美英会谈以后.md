After the US-UK talks

Gao Ji

More than ten days have passed since the end of the US-UK talks, but apart from British Prime Minister Eden tirelessly promoting the "achievements" of the talks, the "spirit of US-UK unity," and the "alignment of common goals," even the US-UK bourgeois newspapers have shown no enthusiasm for it. It is particularly noteworthy that most British bourgeois newspapers almost unanimously felt "disappointed" with the outcome of the talks.

Why did the US-UK talks only elicit a negative response from the British bourgeois newspapers? It is known that the British ruling group originally hoped to obtain US support from these talks to escape or alleviate the difficulties Britain faces at home and abroad. However, the facts show that this expectation has been dashed. Labor MP Crossman pointed out in an article published in the "Daily Mirror" that the result of the talks for Britain was that "every issue requiring an immediate decision was carefully set aside." Crossman also pointed out in his article that Britain "remains where Dulles placed us – on the sidelines." This cannot but continue to harm British interests.

This outcome of the US-UK talks is not at all surprising. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his political report on January 30 that "the US aggressive bloc is precisely using this alliance" (the alliance of the US and its allies) "to seize their vested interests." Since the war, the US has consistently exploited the difficulties of its allies in its relations with them to make them submit to the US's arms race and expansionist policies, and has sought to encroach on their interests. The US employed the same tactics in the US-UK talks.

It should be pointed out that the difficulties Britain faces at home and abroad are largely due to its adherence to the US's arms race and expansionist policies. Because the US forced Britain to bear the obligation of expanding its military and preparing for war, Britain bears an unbearable military expenditure burden. British Prime Minister Eden admitted in his speech to the US House of Representatives that this is "the reason why Britain's balance of payments is constantly under pressure." At the same time, the adverse consequences of the "embargo" policy on the British economy are already very obvious. Eden emphasized at a press conference in Washington that this is "a serious problem" for the Commonwealth. The current situation proves that easing international tensions and improving relations between countries is the only way to escape Britain's current predicament and is also the universal desire of a wide range of people in Britain. In this context, Eden's remarks after the Washington talks, expressing his intention to "continue to make every effort" to improve relations with the Soviet Union and believing that the increase in contacts between Britain and the People's Republic of China "is beneficial," reflect to some extent the British authorities' realistic view of the situation.

However, the situation arising from the outcome of the US-UK talks, particularly the US aggressive bloc's efforts to use the outcome of the US-UK talks to exacerbate international tensions, is in clear contradiction with the aforementioned wishes expressed by the British authorities. People in Washington openly clamored that the US-UK joint declaration was a sign that "the Cold War has started again" and tried their best to promote that the US and Britain have "clearly and finally" abandoned the "Geneva spirit." At the same time, the US, on the one hand, instigated the countries of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc to hold a military exercise to show the US's "strong mobile strike force," and on the other hand, used its propaganda machine to clamor to "put more teeth" into this military bloc. In addition, the US Navy and Air Force recently held "the largest" landing exercise in the Ryukyu Islands in two years to "show the world the combat situation in the nuclear war era."

All of this shows that the US aggressive bloc is intensifying Dulles's policy of "brinkmanship" and atomic intimidation and is trying its best to drag its ally Britain along as its accomplice. This is what Eden called "something more dangerous than risk." It is clear what kind of situation following this US policy will bring Britain to, and it goes without saying.

Britain's greatest expectation for the Washington talks was to rely on US assistance to strengthen its increasingly shaky position in the Middle East. However, the US is trying its best to take advantage of Britain's shaky position to squeeze Britain out of the Middle East and completely replace Britain's colonial control over the region. In this profound contradiction, the US and Britain always hope to find their compromise by suppressing the struggle of Middle Eastern countries and Middle Eastern people to safeguard national independence and by organizing military aggressive blocs. US and British public opinion is using the so-called unrest in the Middle East as an excuse to promote sending troops to the territory of Middle Eastern countries. It is conceivable that the people of Arab countries will never allow US and British imperialism to realize this conspiracy. In fact, if this conspiracy is realized, it will inevitably lead to a situation in which the US further squeezes out Britain in the Middle East.

The US is fully engaged in a struggle for oil in the Middle East with Britain as its opponent. Since the war, the US has already gained the upper hand over its British rival in this struggle. Now the US controls a much larger share of oil in the Middle East than Britain, and the strengthening of the US's position has been achieved at the expense of Britain. However, the US is not satisfied with this. In the Washington talks, it refused to support Britain on the issue of the oil-rich Buraimi Oasis and tried to extend one more foot there, thus making the negotiations between the US and Britain on this issue "deadlocked." The British "Daily Mail" called this behind-the-scenes conflict a petroleum "war" between the US and Britain and complained that the Washington talks did not give Britain "many assurances" in this "war." At the same time, it stated that this "war" and its results "are of utmost importance to Britain's future." This shows how worried Britain is about the US's squeezing activities.

The US-UK talks also revealed profound differences on the issue of so-called relaxing the "embargo." This is prominently manifested in the diametrically opposed statements made by both sides regarding the relevant decisions in the meeting statement. The British side vigorously publicized that Eden had made the US agree to "reduce the number of controlled items on the embargo list," especially rubber, and tried its best to portray this as the most important gain of Eden's visit to the US. However, US officials, congressmen, and propaganda machines have repeatedly poured cold water on this British publicity, stating that the US has not given Britain "any promises" in this regard. US State Department officials said that there was no "any agreement" to change the "embargo" list in the US-UK agreement. Britain's request for so-called relaxation of the "embargo" in these talks shows that Britain has been unable to endure the damage inflicted on it by the "embargo" policy. However, after the Washington talks, the US still tried its best to obliterate and suppress this desire of Britain to improve its foreign trade situation. The sole purpose of this approach is to hinder the international trade on which Britain depends for its survival, make Britain's economy continue to depend on the US, and make its economic situation even worse. This is the real intention of the US to insist on the "embargo" policy.

The US has been painstakingly using the so-called alliance method to weaken its allies, seize their vested interests, and attempt to tie them to the US war chariot. These facts have been clearly proven by the US-UK talks and subsequent developments. In this deal, Britain not only did not get the support it expected but also suffered damage. This once again proves that the US has always pursued a selfish and aggressive policy in its foreign relations, and Britain's placing its destiny on the US-UK alliance can only lead to endless suffering for itself.

    美英会谈以后
    高集
    美英会谈结束已经十多天了，但是除了英国首相艾登不厌其烦地宣传这次会谈的“成绩”、美英“团结的精神”和“共同目的的一致性”之外，甚至连美英资产阶级报纸也没有对它表示任何热情。特别值得注意的是，大多数英国资产阶级报纸几乎是一致地对这次会谈的结果深深感到“失望”。
    为什么美英会谈只能引起英国资产阶级报纸的消极的反应呢？人们知道，英国统治集团原来期望从这次会谈中取得美国的支持，来摆脱或减轻英国在国内外所面临的困难。但是，事实显示，这种期望是落空了。英工党议员克罗斯曼在“每日镜报”上发表的文章中就指出，这次会谈的结果对英国来说，是“每一个需要马上作出决定的问题都小心地被撇开了”。克罗斯曼在他的文章中还指出，英国“仍然处在杜勒斯把我们（指英国）安置的地方——边缘上”。这不能不使英国的利益继续受到损害。
    美英会谈的这种结果是丝毫也不足奇怪的。周恩来总理1月30日的政治报告指出，“美国侵略集团正是利用这种同盟”（美国和它的同盟国的同盟，）“来夺取他们的既得利益。”战后以来，美国在和它的同盟国家的关系中，从来就是不断地利用这些国家的困难，来使它们屈从于美国的备战和扩张政策，并且设法侵占它们的利益。在这次美英会谈中，美国也同样地施展了这种做法。
    应当指出，英国在国内外所面临的困难，在很大程度上是由于它追随美国的备战和扩张政策所造成的。由于美国强使英国负担了扩军备战的义务，英国就承受着难以忍受的军费负担，英国首相艾登在美国众议院发表的演说中承认这是英国“支付平衡不断地遭受压力的原因”。同时，“禁运”政策在英国经济上所造成的恶劣后果，也已是十分明显的了。艾登在华盛顿的记者招待会上就强调说，这对于英联邦“是一个严重问题”。现实的这种情况证明，缓和国际紧张局势，改善国与国之间的关系是摆脱英国目前困难处境的唯一出路，并且也是英国广泛阶层人士的普遍愿望。在这种情况下，艾登在华盛顿会谈之后发表的谈话中表示要“继续尽一切努力”来改善同苏联的关系，并且认为英国同中华人民共和国之间接触的增加“是有益的”，这在一定的程度上反映了英国当局对局势采取了现实的看法。
    但是，美英会谈的结果所引起的局势，特别是美国侵略集团竭力利用美英会谈的结果来加剧国际紧张局势的做法，和上述英国当权人物所表示的愿望之间存在着明显的矛盾。华盛顿的人们公开叫嚷美英联合宣言是“冷战又开始了”的标志，并且竭力鼓吹美英已“明确地和最后地”放弃了“日内瓦精神”。同时，美国一面策动东南亚侵略集团的国家举行一次军事演习，以显示美国的“强大的机动打击力量”，一面又通过它的宣传机器叫嚷要为这个军事集团“装上更多的牙齿”。此外，美国海空军最近还要在琉黄岛举行两年来“最大的一次”登陆演习，以使“全世界看到核子战争时代的作战情况”。
    所有这一切表明，美国侵略集团在变本加厉地执行着杜勒斯的“战争边缘”的原子恫吓政策，并且竭力要把它的同盟国英国拉在一起作它的帮凶。这就是艾登所说的“一种比风险还要危险的东西”。很显然，追随美国的这种政策将会把英国带到什么样的境地，这已是不言自明的了。
    英国对华盛顿会谈所怀抱的最大期望，是企图依靠美国的帮助来加强它在中东日益动摇的地位。但是美国却竭力想利用英国的动摇地位把英国挤出中东，完全取代英国对这个地区的殖民控制。在这种深刻的矛盾中，美英两国总是希望用镇压中东国家和中东人民维护民族独立的斗争，用组织军事侵略集团来寻找它们的妥协。美英舆论正在借口所谓中东地区的不安，宣扬要派军队到中东国家的领土上去。可以想见，阿拉伯国家的人民决不会容许美英帝国主义实现这种阴谋。实际上，这种阴谋如果实现，将不可避免地导致美国在中东进一步排挤英国的情势。
    美国在中东所全力进行的是以英国作为对手的争夺石油的斗争。战后以来，美国在这场斗争中，早已使自己占了英国对手的上风。现在美国在中东所控制的石油的份额已远远地超过了英国，美国地位的加强是在排挤英国的情况下达到的。但是美国并不以此为满足。它在华盛顿会谈中，拒绝在富产石油的布赖米绿洲的问题上支持英国，并且力图在那里多伸一只脚，从而就使美英在这个问题上的谈判“陷于僵局”。英国“每日邮报”把这种幕后的折冲称作为美英之间的石油“战争”，并且抱怨华盛顿会谈没有使英国在这个“战争”中得到“很多保证”。同时，它又表示这个“战争”和它的结果“对英国的前途是至为重要的”。这表现了英国对美国的排挤活动是怎样担心。
    美英会谈在所谓放宽“禁运”的问题上，同样表现了深刻的分歧。这突出地表现在双方对于会谈声明中的有关决定持着截然不同的说法上。英国方面大肆宣传说，艾登已使美国同意“减少禁运货单中被管制的项目”，特别是橡胶，并且竭力把这个渲染成是艾登访美的最重要的收获。但是，美国的官员、议员和宣传机器却一再对英国的这种宣扬泼冷水，表示美国在这方面根本没有给英国以“任何许诺”。美国国务院的官员就说，在美英的协议中并没有要改变“禁运”货单的“任何协议”。英国在这次会谈中要求所谓放宽“禁运”，表明英国已不堪忍受“禁运”政策所加给它的损害。但是，在华盛顿会谈之后，美国还竭力想抹杀和压制英国要求改善它的对外贸易状况的这种愿望，这种做法的唯一目的，就是阻碍英国赖以为生的国际贸易，使英国的经济继续依赖美国，并使它的经济情况更加恶化。这就是美国坚持“禁运”政策的真正意图。
    美国处心积虑利用所谓的同盟方式来削弱它的同盟国，夺取他们的既得利益，并且企图把他们绑在美国的战车上，这些事实已经由美英会谈和这以后的发展清楚地证明了。英国在这场交易中，不但没有得到它所期望得到的支持，反而受到了损害。这再一次证明，美国在对外关系方面始终奉行着损人利己的侵略政策，而英国把它的命运寄托在美英同盟上，只能使它自己遭殃无穷。
