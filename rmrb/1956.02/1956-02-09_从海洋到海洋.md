    From Ocean to Ocean
    Soviet Union, Bao Boleweiyi
    The transatlantic liner "Île de France" approached New York Harbor. …We couldn't help but think: What will we Soviet journalists see here, on this continent where most of us have never been? How do Americans live in their own homes? How will America greet us?
    We were not uninvited guests. From January, we waited nine months for American visas, and finally received the U.S. State Department's invitation to visit the country and a plan for traveling in the United States.
    We made an interesting grand tour of the United States. We crossed the country twice along different routes—going back and forth from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Some cities and regions in the United States are closed to Soviet citizens. We did not request to go to these areas, but we looked at the cities we could enter quite carefully.
    We must admit that we never felt like Columbus discovering a new continent. We Soviets understand the United States and Americans far better than Americans understand us. We must thank American classic and modern writers for this, whose works we have published in large quantities in the past and will continue to publish in large quantities in the future. When we mentioned to American journalists the number of millions of copies of works by excellent American writers that were sold, even the most friendly and well-informed among them looked at us suspiciously: Come on, how is that possible, isn't there a "Cold War" going on?
    But nevertheless, what we saw was still unusual, fascinating, and very interesting. Although we knew the grand spirit of American engineers' technical ideas, it was still hard to imagine the 102-story "Empire State Building" without seeing it with our own eyes. The building is so tall that you feel it swaying gently in the wind when you stand on top. Of course, one can argue whether such a tall building is necessary, and one can logically prove whether it is worthwhile to build buildings so high for a modern city. But you can't help but marvel at the designers' boldness and the workers' skill. The Lincoln Tunnel—this giant pipeline paved under the Hudson River, through which a torrent of cars flows endlessly like grain from a large granary; and the multi-kilometer-long bridge that hangs like an iron ring over the bay, connecting San Francisco and Oakland; the large copper mine in the Steep Rock Mountains, where open-pit mining is being carried out, connecting three mountains into one large depression; the Ford experimental factory near Cleveland, where you can hardly see any workers in its eight-cylinder engine manufacturing workshop! Who else but we Soviets, from a country with the most daring technical ideas, from a country full of giant projects, from a country advancing rapidly on the road to technological progress, can seriously estimate the scale of these projects?
    We visited the most advanced farms and ranches in Arizona, and learned about the excellent experiences of American farming, cotton growing, vegetable growing, and animal husbandry. We had long and friendly conversations with them, which were very interesting conversations with kind and hospitable people, during which both sides came to the same conclusion many times: how great it would be if the successful exchange of experiences between agricultural delegations could become regular!
    In every city we went to, we visited museums, art galleries, and symphony concerts—if they were available. To the great surprise of the accompanying journalists, we even "wasted time" appreciating the precious works of Raphael, Rembrandt, and Van Gogh, the sculptures of Rodin and Bourdelle, and listening to the music of Bach, Beethoven, and Gershwin. We, from the country of Tchaikovsky, Repin, and Antokolsky, from the country of great musicians and advanced art, were very happy to see the unique art treasures of Washington, New York, and San Francisco, and to hear Bach concerts in Washington or wonderful organ performances in Salt Lake City.
    But what brought us the greatest satisfaction and joy was meeting the American people themselves. We had detailed conversations with hundreds of Americans of various social statuses and with different political and religious views.
    Some of these conversations took place in the manager's office of the largest brokerage firm in the heart of Wall Street, and some took place in the New York Stock Exchange manager's room, who himself introduced us to the most mysterious place of capitalism. There, we seemed to be trapped in another incomprehensible and bizarre world, and we saw clearly how the vast flow of wealth brought huge profits to some and bankruptcy to others.
    Everywhere we went, we were greeted warmly and enthusiastically.
    During our travels within the United States, we constantly felt the influence of two opposing currents—warm and cold. In editorial offices, museums, in the offices and reception rooms of mayors and governors, in various factories and in American homes, the reception was warm. But at the same time, we always felt that there was someone—certainly a very powerful person—who was unhappy with the warmth of these meetings, this mutual contact, this desire for cultural exchange and trade, and peaceful coexistence between the two countries, so he used every means to undermine the spirit of these conversations, weaken and perhaps even damage the impression that the three Soviet delegations visiting the United States left on the Americans.
    Our friendly initial acquaintance with American journalists on the ship's deck had not yet ended, and before we could get our suitcases through customs and onto the dock, we saw that among the Americans we had just met on the ship (who came to say goodbye to us), suddenly there appeared some grim-faced people who were stuffing leaflets into people's hands on the left and right. One leaflet was mistakenly stuffed into the hand of one of our delegation members. From this leaflet, we suddenly learned that we ourselves were not journalists or writers at all, but dangerous "spies of the State Political Security Bureau"...
    We all laughed, and then handed the leaflet to the people from the State Department who were accompanying us, and told them that this must be a silly joke or an attack by some madmen. But at the first press conference held in New York, a lady—representing the notorious "Radio Free Europe"—walked up to one of us and said that if any of us were willing to choose the "free world"—that is, to betray our country and stay in the United States—a powerful and highly respected American was prepared to give him an American passport and $1 million. This was no longer a joke, and I solemnly told Mr. E. Glenn, who was working with us from the State Department, about this.
    "Gentlemen, I hope you will understand that you are in a free country and we cannot take any measures against what private individuals want to do," Mr. Glenn shrugged and replied to us.
    Later, throughout our journey, we saw more than once the concrete manifestations of that pathetic thing that Mr. Glenn stubbornly called "American freedom." Somehow, drunkards and hooligans knew the travel route of our delegation even before we ourselves knew it, and they arranged ambushes for us in front of editorial offices, museums, and hotel doors. One Sunday, in Cleveland, the disruption, which was obviously tolerated by the onlookers of policemen, actually injured the head of the driver who was taking us to the car, and an American accompanying us was also lightly hit on the neck. We did not want to disrupt our trip, and in order not to damage the mutual understanding between the two peoples, we had to refuse to go to Chicago, because we were told that an even more "lively" scene had been prepared for us there. Our compatriots may not believe it, and it does seem absurd: when we returned to New York, we were greeted by a large group of policemen and three plainclothes officers, who casually introduced themselves to each of us.
    But if we only saw the unpromising weeds and not the deeply cultivated fields, then we would be bad journalists. In this article, I want to say directly that I think the Americans' view of American democracy and freedom is different from what Mr. Glenn constantly nagged us about. After each such provocation, we received dozens of letters, some of which were published in American newspapers. In these letters, ordinary Americans declared that they were outraged by the behavior of these saboteurs, that they did not regard these enemies of peace and friendship between peoples as their American compatriots, and that these people were as incompatible with America as they were with the Soviet Union. They also sent us flowers. Generous housewives sent us packages of food, even including mustard and soy sauce. Strangers on the street saw us, and while trying to recognize our faces, they stopped their cars, got out, and asked:
    "Are you those Russian youngsters traveling in the United States?"
    After receiving a positive answer, they shook our hands and wished us a safe journey.
    That is how America greeted us.

    从海洋到海洋
    苏联　鲍·波列沃伊
    横渡大西洋的客轮“法兰西之岛”号驶近了纽约港。……我们不禁想到：我们这些苏联新闻工作者会在这里，在我们大多数人从未来过的这块大陆上看到些什么东西，美国人在自己家里是怎样生活的呢，美洲将怎样迎接我们呢？
    我们并非是不速之客。从1月起，我们等美国签证等了9个月之久，最后才得到了美国国务院对访问这个国家的邀请和在美国旅行的计划。
    我们在美国作了一次有趣的大旅行。我们沿着不同的路线两度横越了这个国家——从大西洋到太平洋走了个来回。美国有些城市和地区，是禁止苏联人入境的。我们没有要求到这些地区去，但那些我们可以出入的城市，我们是看得相当仔细的。
    应该承认，我们没有一分钟感觉过自己是发现新大陆的哥仑布。我们苏联人之了解美国和美国人，远远超过美国人之了解我们。这一点，我们必须感谢美国的古典作家和现代作家，他们的作品，我们曾经大量印行，今后也仍然要大量印行。当我们对美国记者提起美国优秀作家作品销行千百万册这个数目的时候，甚至他们中间最友善、最熟悉情况的人也怀疑地看着我们：算了，这怎么可能呢，不是在进行“冷战”么？
    但尽管如此，我们所见到的仍然是不寻常的，引人入胜和十分有趣的。我们虽然知道美国工程师的技术思想的宏大的气魄，但不亲眼看看，仍然难以想像那102层高的“帝国大厦”。这座大厦是那么高，你站在上面竟会觉得它被风吹得轻轻摆动。自然，可以争论，是不是需要这么高的建筑物，也可以用逻辑方法去证实，对于现代化的城市说来，把楼房盖得那么高是否值得。但是你不能不为设计人员的大胆和工人的巧手而叫绝。林肯大隧道——这铺在胡松地下的巨型管道，汽车的洪流像大粮仓里的粮食一样源源不绝地从这里走过；还有那像一条铁环一样悬在海湾上头、把旧金山和奥克兰联结起来的好多公里长的大桥；陡岩山上的大铜矿，那里进行着露天采掘，把三个山联结成一个大洼地；克利夫兰附近的福特实验工厂，在它的制造八个汽缸的马达的车间里，几乎见不着工人！不是我们这些来自技术思想最大胆的国家、来自充满巨型工程的国家、来自在技术进步的道路上一日千里地前进着的国家的苏联人，还有谁能认真估计这些工程的气魄呢。
    我们到过最先进的农场和亚利桑那的养畜场，了解了美国农作、种棉、种菜、养畜的优秀经验。我们同他们作了长时间的友谊交谈，这是些十分有趣的交谈，谈话的对方是些善良的、好客的人们，在谈话中间，双方都多少次走向同一个结论，那就是：如果农业代表团之间的成功的经验交流能够变成经常的，那该多好！
    在我们所去的每个城市，我们都去过博物馆、画廊、交响乐演奏会——如果那里有这些东西的话。使伴随我们的同行记者们十分惊异的是，我们竟在欣赏拉斐尔、伦勃兰特、梵高的珍贵的遗作和罗丹、布合德尔的雕刻上，在听巴哈、贝多芬、葛许温的音乐上“浪费时间”。我们这些来自柴可夫斯基、列宾、安托可尔斯基的国家，来自伟大音乐家和先进艺术的国家的人，看见华盛顿、纽约、旧金山的唯一无二的艺术珍藏，和在华盛顿听巴哈的音乐会或在盐湖城听绝妙的风琴演奏，是十分高兴的事。
    但给我们带来最大满足和愉快的，还是跟美国人本身的会面。我们曾同几百名各种社会地位、具有不同政治与宗教观点的美国人详细交谈过。
    这些次谈话，有的是在华尔街中心的全国最大的经纪人公司的经理办公室里进行的，有的是在纽约交易所经理的房间里进行的，这位经理自己把我们引入了资本主义的最神秘的所在。在那里，我们如同陷入了不可解的、怪异的另一个世界里，了如指掌地看见了浩浩的财流如何给一些人带来暴利，给另一些人带来破产 。
    所到之处，人们都很好地、热情地迎接我们。
    在美国国内旅行的期间，我们始终感到两种相互对立的气流——暖流和寒流的影响。在编辑部、博物馆，在市长、州长的办公室和接待室里，在各个工厂和在美国人的家里，对我们的接待是温暖的。但同时我们却一直觉得，有那么一个人——一定是很有势力的人，他对于这些会面的温暖、这种相互接触、那种十分有力地表现出来的对于文化交往以及贸易、两国和平共处的向往是不痛快的，于是他就用一切办法来毁损这些谈话的精神，削弱也许还要损坏3个访问美国的苏联代表团给美国人所留下的印象。
    我们在轮船甲板上跟美国记者的亲切的初次相识还没完结，还没等我们把皮箱通过海关拿到码头上去，就看见我们在船上刚刚结交了的美国人（他们走来和我们道别）中间，忽然出现了一些面目狰狞的人，朝左右人们手里乱塞传单。有一张传单，他们错塞到我们代表团的一个人手里。从这张传单里，我们忽然知道原来我们自己根本不是新闻工作者，也不是文学家，而是危险的“国家政治保安局的间谍”……
    我们都笑了起来，接着就把这张传单交给了国务院派来陪我们的人，对他们说，这准是一个愚蠢的玩笑或是一些疯子的攻击。但是在纽约举行第一个记者招待会的时候，有一个太太——她是代表臭名远扬的“自由欧洲”电台的，走到我们的一个人旁边，说道，如果我们中间有谁肯选择“自由世界”——也就是肯背叛祖国、留在美国的话，有一个强有力的、威望甚高的美国人准备给他美国护照和100万美元。这可已经不是玩笑了，我郑重地把这件事告诉了埃·格伦先生——他是国务院派来跟我们工作的。
    “先生们，我希望你们会明白，你们是在一个自由国家，我们不能采取任何办法来反对私人要作的事。”格伦先生耸耸肩膀，回答我们说。
    以后，在我们整个旅途中，我们不止一次地看见格伦先生所执拗地称之为“美国自由”的那个可悲的东西的具体表现。醉鬼流氓们不知怎样竟在我们自己还不知道的时候就知道了我们代表团的旅行路线，他们在编辑部、博物馆、旅馆门前对我们安排下埋伏。一个星期天，在克利夫兰，显然是在袖手旁观的警察们纵容之下进行的捣乱，竟把让我们上汽车的汽车司机的头打伤了，一个陪同我们的美国人，脖子上也被轻轻打中了一下，我们不愿意破坏我们的旅行，而且为了不损害两国人民间的相互理解，不得不拒绝去芝加哥，因为有人告诉我们，那里已为我们预备了一个更“热闹”的场面。我们的同胞们可能不相信，而这确实也像是荒诞绝伦的：我们回到纽约的时候，迎接我们的已是一大群警察和3个便衣，这些人，竟若无其事地对我们每个人介绍了自己。
    但是如果我们只由于几棵不成样子的杂草而看不见深耕细作的田地，那我们就是坏记者了。在这篇文章里，我想直截了当地说，我觉得美国人对于美国民主和自由所持的看法，是跟格伦先生常对我们唠叨的决不一样的。每经过一次这样的挑衅行动，我们都接到几十封来信，其中有一部分是在美国报纸上发表了的。普通的美国人在这些信里宣称，他们为这些破坏分子的行为感到气愤，他们不把这些和平和各国人民友好的敌人当作自己的美国同胞，他们说这些人之同美国不相容，正如这些人同苏联不相容是一样的。他们还给我们送来鲜花。慷慨的家庭主妇给我们送来一包包食品，连芥末和酱油都一起包在里面。街上的陌生人见了我们，一面努力辨认着我们的面孔，同时就停下汽车，走出来问道：
    “你们就是那些在美国旅行的俄国小伙子么！”
    得到肯定的回答以后，他们就握住我们的手，祝我们一路平安。
    美国就是这样迎接我们的。
