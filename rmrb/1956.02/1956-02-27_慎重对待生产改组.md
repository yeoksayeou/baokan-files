    Treat Production Reorganization Cautiously
    After the high tide of socialist transformation arrived, the machinery and electrical industry in Wuhan City faced a new situation: on the one hand, the high tide of rural cooperativization created an urgent need for a large number of new-style farm implements, and on the other hand, the scattered production of many joint state-private factories made it difficult to undertake such large-scale batch production tasks. This required appropriate reorganization of some factories to meet these production demands. Therefore, the Wuhan City Machinery and Electrical Industry Bureau planned to conduct a major production reorganization throughout the city in the first quarter, reorganizing 148 factories into 29.
    We can see the consequences of such a hasty major reorganization from the example of the first reorganization they carried out in December. They concentrated five factories, including Xinmin, which produced sewing machines, and Minjian, which repaired ships, to produce only one product, sprayers, and cancelled their original businesses. As a result, the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Provincial Department Store wanted to order more than 1,000 sewing machines, but no factory in Wuhan City could accept this order. Individual parts for large tugboats on the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Shipping Administration's Hanyi line could not be repaired by any factory. Production and sales relationships were disrupted, and everyone had many opinions. If the Machinery and Electrical Bureau's original plan had been followed, with more than 100 factories undergoing production reorganization at the same time, it would inevitably have caused more serious disconnection between production and sales. After the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this problem in early February, it immediately sounded the alarm, and they modified the plan overnight, deciding to reorganize only 31 factories into 7 factories in the first quarter, and leave the rest for gradual adjustments later, in order to avoid chaos.
    Two problems can be seen from this process: one is that many of the existing joint state-private factories are engaged in repair work. On the surface, this seems unremarkable, but in fact, they often have certain specializations in general repair work that other factories do not have. These should be thoroughly understood and retained. The Machinery and Electrical Bureau originally thought that Minjian Factory was only engaged in general ship repair business, and this business could be replaced by other repair shops. Who knew that after the reorganization, it was discovered that only Minjian Factory in the city could repair the tension discs on large tugboats, so the Changjiang Shipping Administration was very dissatisfied with their no longer repairing ships. The Machinery and Electrical Bureau had to transfer the workers and equipment from Minjian Factory who repaired this part to another factory to continue this business. Later, the Machinery and Electrical Bureau re-examined the plan and found that Yu Lianji and other two repair shops, which were originally planned to be merged into the No. 2 Farm Implement Factory, were the only two factories in Wuhan that could repair automobile spring steel plates. If they were merged to produce farm implements, many automobile spring steel plates in the city would be broken and there would be no place to repair them in the city.
    The other is that a comprehensive consideration should be given to the relationship between supply, production, and sales, and current needs should be arranged together with long-term needs. In the fourth quarter of last year, the city's trade departments were unwilling to continue ordering sewing machines because of the backlog, which caused difficulties for Xinmin Factory in production. The Machinery and Electrical Bureau already knew at that time that sewing machines were industrial products frequently needed by the people, and that the national production of sewing machines was insufficient, but in order to solve the temporary difficulties of Xinmin Factory, they agreed with the opinion of the Jianghan District Committee of the Communist Party of China and moved Xinmin Factory to Minjian Factory to produce sprayers. As a result, the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Provincial Department Store were unable to solve the problem of ordering sewing machines in Wuhan City due to the needs of urban and rural areas. Although the Machinery and Electrical Bureau now emphasizes that Xinmin is not an all-round sewing machine factory, and they plan to invest 1 million yuan next year to build a new all-round sewing machine factory, such a large Wuhan City does not even have such a non-all-round sewing machine factory now! Moreover, not trying to develop from the business of the original factory, but relying on state investment to build a new factory is not the way to solve the problem.
    In short, this lesson tells us: do not easily change the existing production and management system of joint state-private factories. When reorganization is necessary, do not simply emphasize that these factories have small output value, poor equipment, and low technology, and only do some "odd jobs," and then act rashly, but should thoroughly and comprehensively understand the situation and treat it cautiously.

    慎重对待生产改组
    曹葆铭　张碨
    在社会主义改造高潮到来以后，武汉市的机电工业便面临着一个新的情况：一方面是农村合作化高潮到来后急需大量的新式农具，一方面是许多公私合营工厂生产分散，很难担负起这种大量成批生产的任务。这就需要将一些工厂加以适当改组，才能适应这种生产要求。于是，武汉市机电工业管理局便计划在第一季度内在全市范围进行生产大改组。将148个工厂改组成29个。
    可以从他们12月里最先改组的一个例子来看，这样急促地大改组会招致什么后果。他们将生产缝纫机的新民和修理船舶的民建等五家工厂集中起来，只生产喷粉器一种产品，把它们原有的业务取消了。这样一来，湖北省供销合作社和省百货公司要订购1，000多部缝纫机，而武汉市却没有工厂能接受这批订货。长江航运管理局的汉宜线上的大拖轮的个别部件，也没有工厂能为他们修理。产销关系打乱了，大家意见纷纷。如果按照机电局原来的计划，100多个工厂同时这样进行生产改组，势必引起更严重的产销脱节现象。中共武汉市委2月初发现这个问题后，立即向他们敲起警钟，他们才连夜修改计划，决定在第一季度只将31个工厂改组为7个工厂，其余的都留到以后逐步调整，以免混乱。
    从这段过程中可以看出两个问题：一个是现有公私合营工厂中有许多是作修理业务的，表面上看来这没有什么了不起，实际上他们往往在一般的修理业务中具有若干为别厂所没有的专长，应该加以深入了解，并把这种专长保留下来。机电局原来认为民建厂只是作一般修理船舶的业务，这种业务可以由别的修理厂代替。谁知改组以后，才发现大拖轮上的松紧盘，全市只有民建厂一家会修，所以长江航运局对他们不再修理船只很有意见。机电局只好将民建厂修理这个部件的工人和设备调到别的厂去，继续作这部分业务。后来，机电局重新检查计划，又发现原来准备并入农具二厂的余联记等两家修理厂，是武汉仅有的两家能修理汽车弹簧钢板的工厂。如果将它们并去生产农具后，全市的许多汽车的弹簧钢板坏了，就在市内找不到修理的地方了。
    另一个是应该从供产销关系上全面加以考虑，将目前的需要同长远的需要同时加以安排。去年第四季度，市里的贸易部门因为缝纫机有积压，就不愿继续订货，给新民厂在生产上造成困难。机电局当时已经知道缝纫机是人民生活中经常需要的工业品，并且全国缝纫机的生产不足，但是他们为了解决新民厂一时的困难问题，也就同意了中共江汉区委的意见，将新民工厂搬到民建厂生产喷粉器去了。这样一来，湖北省供销合作社和省百货公司因为城乡需要，要在武汉市订购缝纫机就没法解决。尽管机电局现在还强调新民不是一个全能的缝纫机厂，他们计划明年投资100万元再新建一个全能的缝纫机厂，但是这么大的武汉市现在就连这样一家不全能的缝纫机厂也没有了！何况这样不设法从原有工厂的业务来加以发展，而依赖国家投资另建新厂，并不是解决问题的办法。
    总之，这个教训告诉我们：不要轻易改变现有的公私合营工厂的生产和经营制度。在必须改组的时候，也不要单纯强调这些工厂产值小、设备差、技术不高，光作些“打杂活”，便轻率从事，而应当深入全面地了解情况，慎重对待。
