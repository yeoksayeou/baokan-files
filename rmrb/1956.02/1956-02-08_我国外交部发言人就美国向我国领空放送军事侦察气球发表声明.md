Xinhua News Agency, February 7th – A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today issued a statement on the provocative act of the United States openly sending military reconnaissance balloons into the airspace over Chinese territory, violating Chinese airspace.

The Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that recently, a large number of balloons have been discovered over Chinese territory. These balloons are made in the United States, with a diameter of 36 to 40 feet, and have parachutes and other suspended objects hanging below. The suspended objects include automatic cameras for aerial photography of terrain and radio transceiver equipment.

The spokesperson said that the equipment on the balloons proves that they are military reconnaissance balloons. The purpose is to photograph China's terrain for military use. The United States' open sending of military reconnaissance balloons into the airspace over Chinese territory is a serious provocative act that violates Chinese airspace. We express our serious protest against this and demand that the U.S. government immediately stop this provocative act.
