To the Editor:

    Tang Lianhua, a poor peasant from Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan, joined the Shaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the winter of 1954. On the afternoon of October 7, 1955, his thatched cottage unfortunately caught fire. The north wind carried the flames, and soon they rushed to the roof. Because his house was located in a remote mountain depression, only Mao Zaisui, the vice chairman of the Shaoshan Agricultural Cooperative who was working in the fields, and a few cooperative members were able to arrive in time and save more than 1,200 catties of rice. By the time the large group of farmers arrived, most of his belongings had been burned to ashes.
    That evening, the committee members of the Shaoshan Agricultural Cooperative held a meeting and decided to mobilize all cooperative members to help each other and rebuild the burned thatched cottage for Tang Lianhua. The next morning, Vice Chairman Mao Zaisui, along with more than 30 cooperative members with strong labor power or skills, volunteered to help Tang Lianhua. On the third day, a new five-room thatched cottage was built on the ruins, and it was even more spacious than the old house. Subsequently, many cooperative members brought bedding, quilts, wooden boxes, tables, benches, and other daily necessities to Tang Lianhua.
    Tang Lianhua's family was extremely moved. Tang's mother said, "If it weren't for the agricultural cooperative, we wouldn't have been able to recover from such a fire even in ten years, let alone build such a new house!"

    废墟上的新屋编辑同志：
    湘潭韶山乡贫农汤连华是1954年冬季加入韶山农业生产合作社的。1955年10月7日下午，他家的茅屋不幸起火了。北风卷着火苗，很快就冲上了屋顶。由于他家单独处在一个山坳里，只有正在田里耕作的韶山农业社副社长毛再遂同几个社员能够及时赶来，抢救了1，200多斤稻谷；大群农民赶到的时候，大部分东西都被火烧得精光了。
    当晚，韶山农业社的社务委员们就开了一个会，决定动员全体社员互助互济，帮汤连华把烧掉的茅屋重新盖起来。第二天早晨，副社长毛再遂就同30多个劳动力较强或有手艺的社员为汤连华义务帮工。第三天，一栋五间的新茅屋就在废墟上建立起来了，而且盖得比旧屋还要宽敞。接着，不少社员又为汤连华送来了床铺、棉絮、木箱、桌凳等日常用具。
    汤连华一家感动得不得了。汤二老娘说：“要不是农业社，遭着这样一场火，十年也翻不过身来，哪里还能盖起这样新屋来！”
