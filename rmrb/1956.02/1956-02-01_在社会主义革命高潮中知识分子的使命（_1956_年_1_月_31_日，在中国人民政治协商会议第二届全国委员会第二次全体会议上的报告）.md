The Mission of Intellectuals in the High Tide of Socialist Revolution
(Report at the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on January 31, 1956)
Guo Moruo

Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and suggest that a comprehensive discussion and in-depth study be carried out at this meeting to further strengthen our people's democratic united front and, under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, make greater achievements in national construction and international activities.

In his report, Chairman Zhou Enlai mentioned the issue of intellectuals, explaining that the strength of our current intellectuals, whether in terms of quantity, professional ability, or political awareness, is still not adapted to the needs of the rapidly developing national construction; and that some government departments still have certain unreasonable phenomena in the use and treatment of intellectuals, which hinder the full play of the strength of intellectuals to varying degrees. The CPC Central Committee recently held a meeting on the issue of intellectuals and decided to strengthen leadership with great efforts, to conduct comprehensive planning for scientific research, engineering technology, medicine and health, education, literature and art, and other aspects of work, and to solve the existing problems as quickly as possible, so that the strength of intellectuals can be fully developed and grown, and so that the most important and most needed knowledge departments, especially the most urgently needed scientific departments, can approach the advanced level of the world within 12 years.

This decision of the CPC Central Committee is very exciting, especially for intellectuals. As far as I know, with the exception of a very small number of backward elements, the vast majority of intellectuals support this decision with the greatest enthusiasm and sincerity. We feel that the Party and the government care for intellectuals meticulously, and at the same time, we feel that intellectuals bear a more significant responsibility in the cause of national construction. All responsible intellectuals are seriously considering how to live up to the expectations of the Party and the government and complete the glorious and arduous tasks given by the great motherland.

I myself am also an intellectual. The Standing Committee designated me to make a special report on the issue of intellectuals at this meeting. Now I am prepared to make some supplementary explanations on the issue of intellectuals from the following five perspectives.

I. Contributing Strength

Due to the long-term stagnation of the feudal system and the long-term aggression of colonialism over the past century, the intellectual circles of old China, like the entire nation, have been greatly hindered in their development. Precisely because of this, patriotic intellectuals have long combined their own destiny with the destiny of the nation and waged unyielding struggles to seek national liberation. For decades, patriotic intellectuals have often played a bridging role in the struggle for national liberation.

Chairman Mao said in "On Coalition Government" long ago: "In the people's liberation struggle of the past half century, especially in the struggle since the May Fourth Movement, and in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the broad revolutionary intellectuals have played a great role in the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people. They will play a greater role in the future struggle. Therefore, in the future, the people's government should plan to cultivate various types of intellectual cadres from the broad masses of the people, and pay attention to uniting and educating all existing useful intellectuals." This clearly tells us that Chairman Mao and the CPC Central Committee have always attached importance to intellectuals. During the period of the people's liberation struggle, a large number of intellectuals were absorbed and participated in the revolution; after the victory of the people's liberation struggle, the broad masses of intellectuals had the opportunity to actively participate in the great cause of national construction under the correct policy of unity, education, and transformation implemented by the Party.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in order to enable intellectuals to adapt to the cause of socialist construction and better contribute their strength, the Party and the government have given intellectuals various job opportunities, and have adopted various methods to allow intellectuals to carry out ideological education of self-transformation, to transform the backward ideas of the bourgeoisie and feudal landlord class cultivated in the old era into the progressive ideas of the working class. A large number of intellectuals participated in large-scale struggles such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance against America and aid to Korea, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements; visited the construction work of factories and rural areas; visited the Soviet Union, and participated in various international activities; in this way, intellectuals had the opportunity to accept progressive ideas through the practice and observation of social life. At the same time, through large-scale theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism, through systematic criticism of bourgeois idealism, and through the exposure of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, intellectuals were able to more clearly distinguish the ideological boundaries between the enemy and ourselves and improve their political sense. Furthermore, through business practice based on the principle of "theory linked with practice," learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and launching criticism and self-criticism, they improved their working methods and improved their professional level.

After several years of study, the political awareness and professional ability of intellectuals have been significantly improved. They have also done a lot of work and made many achievements in the cause of national construction. There is no need to list them one by one. But undeniably, even if we only talk about the strength of the existing intellectuals, our existing strength has not been fully and most effectively utilized.

In recent years, due to the needs of temporary work, some senior intellectuals have left their own professions and taken on administrative work. However, due to the mismatch of their learning, they have not been able to fully and effectively exert their strength in both administrative and professional aspects. Some people have even been affected by excessive concurrent jobs and excessive social activities. Too many meetings and too many temporary tasks have also made it impossible for some experts to concentrate their energy and time on professional activities. Some people's job positions are not assigned very appropriately. Some people have frequent job transfers. Some people have positions but no work. Even fewer people have never had a job position.

Undoubtedly, such unreasonable phenomena in the use of intellectuals are a loss to the cause of national construction. The Party and the government have decided to quickly change these unreasonable phenomena in order to fully mobilize intellectuals to give full play to their expertise. In particular, in response to the intellectuals' appeal for not being able to control their own time, the Party and the government have made the decision that senior intellectuals should have at least six-fifths of their working days in the future, that is, 40 hours per week, engaged in professional activities.

These timely decisions of the CPC Central Committee will undoubtedly increase the enthusiasm and work efficiency of intellectuals. It is completely understandable that intellectuals express their heartfelt welcome and support for the decision-making of the CPC Central Committee.

However, if the problem is to be completely solved, at least half of the responsibility still depends on the efforts of the intellectuals themselves. After six years of ideological education of self-transformation, there are still more than 10% of backward elements among senior intellectuals. The intermediate elements still account for about 40%, and the number cannot be considered small; they support socialism, and generally can complete their tasks in their work, but are not active enough politically. Today, the socialist revolution has reached a climax, and it can be basically completed throughout the country in about three years. Why can half of the senior intellectuals still hesitate on the road forward? We intellectuals must make the greatest self-efforts to quickly reduce this phenomenon, so that the government's measures to fully mobilize the strength of intellectuals can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

The drums of the socialist revolution are sounding so loudly, we believe that all our intellectuals will certainly not allow themselves to turn a deaf ear and remain indifferent. All intellectuals with patriotic enthusiasm, in such a great era of socialist revolution, must be willing to give full play to all their strength in the various construction undertakings of the motherland. The scientific and cultural level of Chinese intellectuals is generally not high, but if we can pool our efforts, honestly and wholeheartedly serve the people, then we will be able to make certain achievements.

The era is summoning intellectuals: contribute all your strength to socialism. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, our 3.84 million ordinary intellectuals and more than 100,000 senior intellectuals must not fail to live up to the mission of this era. Those engaged in scientific research should work hard in scientific research under the national science development plan, learn from the advanced experience of the world, make up for the shortest and most urgently needed scientific departments, train a large number of new scientific talents, and strive to rapidly improve China's scientific level. Those engaged in education should improve the quality of teaching, cultivate a large number of intellectuals for the motherland, and rapidly develop the ranks of intellectuals from several million to tens of millions. Those engaged in engineering technology should learn from advanced experience, improve their technical level, and respond to the call of the Party and the state in production and basic construction to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Those engaged in health work should, on the basis of strengthening unity and mutual learning between hundreds of thousands of Chinese medicine practitioners and tens of thousands of Western medicine practitioners, do a good job in urban factory and mine hygiene work and realize the requirements of the "National Agricultural Development Program": eliminate the four pests, eliminate the nine major diseases, and protect women and children. Those engaged in literary and artistic work should strive for various creations and artistic practices, to reflect the rich and vivid struggle of the people in the great socialist era, and to shape the image of advanced figures, so as to inspire the construction enthusiasm of the masses of the people. All intellectuals engaged in science, engineering, culture, education, health, and other work, we should be worthy of the title of intellectuals of New China, worthy of being a part of the working class, and contribute all our useful knowledge to our great motherland without reservation and without stinginess.

Zeng Shen, a great disciple of Confucius, a great intellectual more than two thousand years ago, had to reflect on himself every day with the same three questions. Today, we might as well learn from his example and often reflect on ourselves with the following three questions every day.

The first question: Are we not active enough in serving the people and serving socialist construction?

The second question: Have we really made contributions in expanding the team and uniting internal forces?

The third question: Do we have a high degree of consciousness in learning Marxism-Leninism and learning advanced experience, and are we not slack?

If we can give a positive answer to these three questions in the active aspect, and can resolutely deny them in the negative aspect, then we will definitely be able to give full play to our strength in our own work positions, improve our professional level, catch up with the needs of construction, and complete or overfulfill the glorious and arduous tasks given to us by the country.

II. Expanding the Team

To enable intellectuals to complete the arduous tasks given by the state, more active steps and more effective methods must be taken to expand the ranks of intellectuals.

The number of intellectuals left over from the old era is very limited, especially the more senior intellectuals. Among the more than 100,000 senior intellectuals in China, there are more than 31,000 educational personnel above the rank of lecturer, about 25,000 health personnel above the rank of attending physician, including both Chinese and Western medicine, about 3,000 scientific research personnel above the rank of assistant researcher, more than 31,000 engineering and technical personnel above the rank of engineer, more than 6,000 senior cultural and artistic personnel, and about 5,000 other experts. Among them, the newly increased strength since liberation accounts for 35%.

The growth rate of new strength in the past six years has been quite large. However, China is a large country with a population of 600 million, and the large-scale national construction cause expects more and more work from intellectuals. The number of just over 100,000 senior intellectuals is completely disproportionate to the needs of national construction.

In order to meet the needs of national construction and expand the ranks of intellectuals, especially the ranks of senior intellectuals, the central government is engaged in formulating a twelve-year plan for training senior intellectuals. According to preliminary calculations, at least more than 1 million senior intellectuals must be trained in the next twelve years to meet the needs of all aspects of the country. This is undoubtedly an extremely arduous task. This task mainly falls on the shoulders of most of the existing senior intellectuals. The training of graduates from institutions of higher learning depends on the teachers of the existing institutions of higher learning; the promotion of experts in service depends on the senior researchers of various research institutions and the older generation of experts in various fields.

Does this increase the burden on teaching workers, scientific research workers, and various experts? Yes. However, this is a glorious burden. Senior intellectuals, especially those engaged in scientific research, do not almost all have such a common requirement - to be equipped with necessary assistants and students? This requirement can be substantially satisfied in the future. We can contribute more of our strength to train more outstanding talents for the country.

"To gain the talents of the world and educate them," the great intellectuals of ancient times considered it a happy task. Today, we are educating talents in order to complete the noble task of socialist construction, and this kind of happiness should be increased countless times.

For more than six years, our educators and scientific research workers have contributed great strength and made remarkable achievements in cultivating new forces. From the perspective of the situation of institutions of higher learning, the number of teaching assistants in national universities and colleges increased from 5,796 in 1950 to 24,472 in 1955, which is 4.2 times that of 1950, accounting for 58.2% of all 42,066 teachers; the number of lecturers in 1950 was only 3,637, and it increased to 10,095 in 1955, which is 2.78 times that of 1950, accounting for less than 24% of all teachers. From the perspective of the situation of the Academy of Sciences, there are a total of 2,483 research personnel in the entire academy, including 1,634 intern researchers, accounting for 65.8%; and 421 assistant researchers, accounting for 17%. These young teachers and young scientific workers are full of vigor, have a strong desire for knowledge and a sense of responsibility, are very sensitive to new things, and are making rapid progress in politics and business. This is a congratulatory phenomenon. The reason why this congratulatory phenomenon has occurred is inseparable from the leadership of the Party and the government; it is also inseparable from the assistance of Soviet experts and the inspiration of advanced Soviet experience. However, we must never overlook another important factor, that is, the efforts of the older generation of teachers and scientists, and the spirit of the older generation of experts who are good at guiding and teaching tirelessly. Passing on their valuable knowledge and experience to young people is an indispensable factor in cultivating new forces. We hope that our older generation of teachers and experts can give full play to this spirit.

The way to train experts is different from the way to train students. To train experts, it is necessary to use the way of apprenticeship, that is, individual guidance. According to general experience, it is best for a mentor to only bring four or five apprentices, and it may not be possible to bring them well if there are more. This may be a conservative view. The success of apprenticeship depends on the mentor's high skill and the apprentice's eagerness to learn. If the apprentice is eager to learn, and the teacher is skillful and can lead, why not bring more? The government has decided to allocate the most outstanding graduates of institutions of higher learning to scientific research, and there will be no problem in terms of equipment, books, and materials. If a mentor can bring 10 apprentices, then the growth of new forces will be even faster.

For example, the Academy of Sciences' preliminary plan for cultivating new forces in the past was to train more than 10,500 graduate students in 12 years. This is the number obtained based on the assumption that one mentor trains five students, and one of the five is unsuccessful. If each mentor is increased to train 10, and it is estimated that two of the 10 are unsuccessful, can't the number of graduate students trained be doubled? This is worth our efforts to strive for.

It should be pointed out that increasing the burden on mentors to a certain extent is also beneficial to the mentors themselves. Because, in order to overcome difficulties, they have to use their brains more and find ways to complete the task, so they will improve their own ability more quickly.

Everyone has no small potential strength. Our advanced workers and peasants are almost always creating new records in production and construction. In the past six years, the Chinese people have linked one victory to a greater victory on all fronts, and one of the reasons is that they have exerted all their potential strength with the greatest tension. Therefore, we hope that all senior intellectuals will make the most tense efforts to expand the ranks of intellectuals and further exert their potential strength.

III. Improving the Level

We must admit that we lag behind the advanced level of the world in science and culture. But this does not mean that all our cultural departments are very backward. For example, our drama art, under the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," has been widely praised in performances in Asian and European countries recently after a short period of consolidation. For another example, our scientific research also has a few scholars who have a considerable status in the world. We must strive for perfection in what has been achieved; we must catch up in what is backward. Generally speaking, we are behind in many aspects. Especially in scientific research, we still have many blank spots and blank areas. There are two reasons for this, one is that scientific research was particularly neglected in the reactionary era; the other is that in the recent 20 years, world science and technology have made rapid progress, so the distance is getting farther and farther. Now please allow me to say a few more words about the development of world science.

We all know that we have now reached the era of atomic energy. The Soviet Union had already built the world's first atomic power station the year before last; this year, it will build a new atomic power station with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts and put it into production. In terms of equipment for atomic energy research, the Soviet Union had already built the world's largest synchrocyclotron in 1949, and this year it will also build a larger synchrophasotron that can accelerate protons to 10 billion electron volts. With the development of atomic energy research, radioactive isotopes have been widely used in the metallurgical industry, machine industry, chemical industry, petroleum industry, construction industry, instrument manufacturing industry, agriculture, and medical undertakings, solving many problems that could not be solved in the past; at the same time, they have also been widely used in the research work of many disciplines. The use of heavy hydrogen thermonuclear reactions in industry has also been put on the agenda of scientists.

With the development of electronics, automatic control and remote control have also made great progress. In the Soviet Union and other industrially advanced countries, highly automated factories, mines, and power stations have appeared one after another. It not only frees mankind from heavy physical labor, but also greatly increases labor productivity. The latest electronic computer can perform 15,000 calculations per second, and the accuracy reaches the possible error of only one in ten billion. It can quickly record and sort out various scientific data and literature, and classify and count them. It has a large-capacity "memory system" that can reproduce the materials recorded in the past. It has a high-speed "logical reasoning system" that can process materials according to a large number of instruction signals. It can carry out text translation work. This kind of computer can already conditionally partially replace mental labor.

Another very important department in physics is semiconductor physics. Using semiconductors, light energy and heat energy can be directly converted into electrical energy. For example, if a semiconductor photoelectric generator with a light-receiving area of one square meter is placed in the sunlight, it can emit 50 watts of electricity; if a semiconductor thermoelectric generator is placed on a kerosene lamp, it can generate the electricity needed by a radio. This kind of device is of great use in places lacking electricity. Semiconductor instruments can also be used to replace vacuum tubes, which are small in size, low in cost, and durable. The development of semiconductor research has led to innovations in radio electronics technology. Due to the large-scale use of semiconductors, the volume of radio electronics instruments has been greatly reduced, and the cost has also been greatly reduced.

Countries have also made great progress in metallurgical research. For example, the strength of titanium metal and its alloys is higher than that of ordinary steel. It is particularly light and is an excellent material for manufacturing aircraft, especially high-speed aircraft, and is very important in national defense.

In terms of power machinery, gas turbines have now appeared. This kind of machine is currently using gas formed by mixing liquid fuel or gas with air to drive the gas turbine, and in the future, it may directly use pulverized coal combustion to replace it. It does not need steam, so it does not need boilers and water; the equipment is simple and the efficiency is very high. The time and investment required to build a power plant using a gas turbine are less than half of that of a power plant using a steam engine. Needless to say, this kind of machine is especially suitable for areas lacking water.

The technology of high temperature, high pressure, and high speed, and the technology of ultra-high temperature, ultra-high pressure, and ultra-high speed are also developing rapidly, and are having an increasingly large impact on science and technology and industrial production. New production processes with extremely high labor productivity and various means of transportation with extremely high speed are constantly being produced.

These amazing achievements are only a part of the recent development of world science and technology. Compared with such developed science and technology, we are indeed far behind. In order to make our country's most urgently needed scientific departments approach the constantly developing advanced level of the world within 12 years, we must take various most effective and fastest methods and do our best to catch up.

Are there such methods?

Our answer is yes.

Here we want to especially thank our Party and Chairman Mao, and here we want to especially thank our ally the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. The Party and the government are already formulating a comprehensive plan for the development of scientific research, and with the selfless help of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, under the excellent socialist system, we can concentrate our efforts to carry out our work, which guarantees that our country's most urgently needed scientific departments will be able to approach the advanced level of the world within 12 years, and will be able to master various advanced equipment and technologies.

We know that the government has made a decision: to concentrate the most outstanding scientific personnel and the most outstanding university graduates in scientific research and march towards science; to prepare all the necessary working conditions for scientific research, such as books, materials, equipment, scientific intelligence, research assistants, and research institutions. All the most needed deficiencies or weak links will be quickly supplemented and strengthened. On the basis of establishing our country's scientific research work, we will obtain comprehensive assistance from the Soviet Union.

This is the new situation of scientific research that is unfolding in front of our scientific workers. Scientists are particularly excited, and the vast majority of people are fully mentally prepared to welcome the unfolding of this new situation.

In the past few years, we have taken some detours in scientific research. Without comprehensive planning, without scientific intelligence, and without appropriate contact and division of labor, we have had to start from scratch with many old problems that have already been solved in other countries, even in other departments in the country. This approach has wasted a lot of our energy. For example, "aluminum-nickel-cobalt" alloy, because the production department needs it, our scientific workers have spent a lot of effort to study its smelting method, but this research was already achieved by Japanese scholars 25 years ago, and the Soviet Union started production in 1936. China can obtain a complete set of equipment, data, and methods from the Soviet Union, and there is no need to start from scratch.

For example, if we want to create semiconductor instruments, we need a metal called germanium, and the refining of pure germanium is still a very difficult thing for us. If we want to start from refining germanium, it will take a long time before we can produce germanium-based semiconductor instruments. But if we import pure germanium while sending people abroad to study semiconductors, the production of semiconductor instruments can be advanced by several years.

Judging from these examples, with the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, many scientific research projects do not need to start from scratch. We can adopt the method of catching up or leaping forward. Therefore, even though the advanced level of the world is constantly advancing, we can still catch up with the advanced level of the world in a shorter period of time.

But such a speed of development can only be achieved today; it can only be achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.

IV. Self-Education

Since liberation, the ideological education work of intellectuals has achieved great success. Thanks to the strong leadership of the Party and the government, the vigorous assistance of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and the self-efforts of intellectuals, the face of Chinese intellectual circles has undergone fundamental changes in the past six years. Progressives and middle-of-the-roaders who support socialism each account for about 40%, and the number of backward elements has been reduced to more than 10%, but it cannot be ignored that there are still a few counter-revolutionaries and bad elements lurking in the ranks of intellectuals.

Having been immersed in the long-term influence of more than two thousand years of feudal society and more than a hundred years of semi-colonial experience, the concept of private ownership and individualism is deeply rooted. It is inconceivable that all intellectuals have been transformed after only six years. But it is also inconceivable that in today's high tide of socialist revolution, some intellectuals can still remain self-enclosed and hesitate.

We know that the Party and the government are going to strengthen leadership and vigorously promote the help of intellectuals in carrying out self-transformation. All the methods that have been effective in the past six years will be carried out more comprehensively and deeply in the future. For backward elements, we should strive to win over and educate them as much as possible, seriously criticize them, patiently educate them, wait for improvement, and let them gradually turn to socialism. For middle-of-the-roaders, we should help them as much as possible to get out of the middle state and transform into active progressives. We should also help progressives to continue to progress continuously. As for the current counter-revolutionaries lurking among intellectuals, they should be thoroughly purged, but this is no longer within the scope of the ideological transformation of general intellectuals, and I will not talk much about it here.

Under this clear guideline and policy, we hope that all democratic parties and people's organizations can further cooperate fully and jointly promote. Intellectuals generally have party or group affiliations. Collective education by parties and groups can achieve more, greater, and faster results than individual exploration. For more than six years, various democratic parties and people's organizations have made many contributions in assisting the Party and the government in promoting the ideological transformation of intellectuals. We hope that we can further provide strong assistance to this work in the future.

Of course, ideological transformation is a meticulous and long-term task, and its main key lies in the individual's consciousness and self-education. The work of self-education should be continuously strengthened among our intellectuals. Progressives are the backbone of self-education in intellectual circles and should play a leading and bridging role. If progressives do not continue to work hard and pursue continuous progress, they will not only fail to play such a role, but will become increasingly backward without realizing it. Progressives are prone to carrying the burden of "thinking they are progressive," which is something we should be vigilant about. The story of the hare and the tortoise is familiar to all of us. In the great march of the socialist revolution, we hope that no one will sleep on the roadside.

Today, the methods that should be adopted to strengthen the work of self-education in intellectual circles or every intellectual are still the various methods that have been effective in the past six years. Experience in real life, experience in professional work, study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries, criticize idealist thought and learn materialist thought, launch free discussions, launch criticism and self-criticism, these methods should be carried out more organized, more planned, and more comprehensively and deeply. In particular, the method of criticism and self-criticism is the key to self-education. Chairman Mao suggested at the closing of the Second Session of the First National Committee: to carry out self-education and self-transformation with the method of criticism and self-criticism, this is a valuable instruction that we must always remember. Although the work of ideological transformation of intellectuals is a specific historical task, the work of self-education of intellectuals is endless. Even in a communist society, everyone must carry out self-education. Criticism and self-criticism, like air, cannot be separated from people who are constantly pursuing progress. We must strive to create such a healthy atmosphere of criticism.

However, we should realize that the ideological transformation of intellectuals is actually a reflection of the serious class struggle in the socialist revolution period. To enable the vast number of intellectuals to transform the backward ideas of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, which have been cultivated for a long time in the old era, into the advanced ideas of the working class, to make their worldview, outlook on life, and work habits adapt to the requirements of socialism, it is unimaginable that it can be easily achieved without a considerable period of serious ideological struggle. No matter how gentle the breeze and drizzle, it will inevitably blow your hair and wet your clothes. If there are intellectuals who cannot accept even the criticism of the gentle breeze and drizzle, then it proves that he has not yet made the determination to carry out self-criticism. It is easy to talk about criticism and self-criticism; but it is very difficult to carry it out seriously. This requires many internal struggles before it can be done seriously. We intellectuals, seriously speaking, are not good at condoning ourselves at all. We must always make ourselves able to withstand thousands of trials and tribulations and be able to move forward in the storm. One-sided accommodation cannot solve the problem, and one-sided dependence cannot solve the problem. One cannot be arrogant, nor can one belittle oneself. Intellectuals must have the tenacity to dedicate their entire lives to the cause of justice. Without this tenacity, one cannot become an excellent scientist. Without this tenacity, one cannot become an excellent artist. Without this tenacity, we cannot improve the international status of our science and culture. Without this tenacity, we cannot complete the glorious and arduous tasks we undertake in national construction.

I recently read "My Opinions on the Issue of Intellectuals" written by Chen Yuan, the president of Beijing Normal University. There is such a sentence in the article: "Every revolutionary intellectual should strive to demand himself according to the standards of a Communist Party member." I admire this sentence very much. But I want to widen the boundaries he refers to. That is, "Every intellectual should demand himself according to the standards of a Communist Party member."

If every intellectual can agree with my statement and can demand himself according to the standards of a Communist Party member, then we will definitely be able to win a brilliant victory in the ideological struggle of self-transformation of intellectuals, and we will definitely be able to complete the great historical task of ideological transformation of intellectuals ahead of schedule.

We hope that that day can come as early as possible.

V. Strengthening Unity

"Our people should have a long-term plan to strive to change our country's backward economic, scientific, and cultural conditions in a few decades and quickly reach the advanced level of the world. In order to achieve this great goal, what determines everything is to have cadres, to have a sufficient number of excellent scientific and technical experts; at the same time, we must continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front and unite all possible forces. Our people must also unite with the people of all countries in the world and strive to safeguard world peace."

This is an extremely important instruction given by Chairman Mao at the recent (January 25) Supreme State Conference. Chairman Mao's words are aimed at the people of the whole country, but it goes without saying that they include the broad masses of intellectuals and place ardent expectations on intellectuals. The responsibilities of our intellectuals are indeed very significant. We have a responsibility to work hard to cultivate new forces, expand the team, and have a sufficient number of cadres; we must work hard to improve our professional level and ideological level in order to become or produce excellent experts; and under the creation of these conditions, "we must strive to change our country's backward economic, scientific, and cultural conditions in a few decades and quickly reach the advanced level of the world." Chairman Mao said "in a few decades," and we must not relax quickly. Because this instruction includes changing the backward economic conditions, and since it has been stated that we must strive to "quickly reach," then it cannot be interpreted as sixty or seventy years; if we only talk about science and culture, then it should be a shorter period, that is, twenty or thirty years.

Chairman Mao mentioned the issue of unity here, "to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front and unite all possible forces," and even more to "unite with the people of all countries in the world and strive to safeguard world peace." This is talking about unity on a large scale. But to do a good job of unity on a large scale, intellectuals must also do a good job of unity on a small scale at the same time. If there are even problems with unity on a small scale, then they cannot make contributions to "consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front," and even less can they "unite with the people of all countries in the world."

Are there still problems with unity on a small scale among intellectuals?

Yes, although the problems are not very big.

For the past six years, under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the unity of Chinese intellectuals themselves and the unity of intellectuals with relevant parties has been increasing day by day. Now, most intellectuals support socialism, support the policies of the Party and the government, are willing to accept the leadership of the Party, are willing to study Marxism-Leninism and learn from the Soviet Union, and recognize the great significance of strengthening the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. This is something to celebrate. However, on the other hand, there are also some phenomena that are not entirely satisfactory.

First of all, the current relationship between intellectuals and the leading comrades of their units is not close enough, and mutual understanding, mutual trust, and mutual assistance between them are not sufficient. Regarding this situation, the CPC Central Committee has conducted a comprehensive inspection and has made a decision to quickly change this situation. The State Council will soon establish the China Expert Bureau, which will be responsible for handling various administrative issues related to Chinese experts, and conduct unified leadership, unified adjustment, and unified inspection and supervision. Various departments and regions should also designate appropriate institutions to be responsible for handling and inspecting issues related to intellectuals.

The central government's decision is comprehensive, and the implementation will be rapid. However, the other side of the problem still lies with the intellectuals themselves. Some intellectuals' thoughts and positions are still not very correct, and some are even very incorrect. There are even a very few people who once held the erroneous view that the Party cannot lead science and technology. In fact, to develop China's science and technology and to raise backward science and technology to the international advanced level, only the Party can make comprehensive plans and provide specific leadership. The Party's leadership will not only not restrict the development of specialized businesses, but will also give these businesses the correct direction and planning, and appropriate arrangements, organization, division of labor, cooperation, inspection, and supervision. The erroneous views of these people should be criticized.

Undeniably, there are also some problems among intellectuals themselves. There are often large or small gaps between colleagues or between different lines of work, between different institutions or between different units of the same institution, and between peers or between different generations. The thoughts of individualism, sectarianism, and departmentalism still exist in the minds of many intellectuals. Therefore, in business, they cannot achieve full mutual respect, mutual consultation, and mutual assistance, and often act independently, without communication, without seeking division of labor, and without cooperation. People with considerable departmentalism even resist the overall planning of the leadership. These people only worry about the dispersion of their own manpower and do not consider the needs of national construction. Some people are accustomed to working alone and cannot engage in collective work; they appreciate themselves in solitude and are narrow-minded. The existence of these phenomena inevitably affects business and the cause of national construction. The key to overcoming these phenomena is still the issue of ideological education.

The relationship between intellectuals and workers and peasants also needs to be worked hard to improve. Strengthening and consolidating the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals is of great significance for completing the cause of socialist construction. Although some intellectuals have gained considerable understanding of the creative labor of workers and peasants and of their lives, demands, and struggles by participating in land reform and visiting rural factories, in general, intellectuals' understanding of workers and peasants is still very poor. Some people still despise labor, despise the working people, and despise cadres from working-class backgrounds, which is a reflection of the consciousness of the exploiting class. In serving socialism, we intellectuals must consciously become a part of the working class, we must take the initiative to approach the workers and peasants, to understand the demands of the workers and peasants, and to use our work and creation to meet their needs.

    在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命
    （1956年1月31日，在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上的报告）
    郭沫若
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，并建议在本次会议上展开全面的讨论和深入的学习，使我们的人民民主统一战线进一步加强，在中国共产党和毛主席的强有力的领导下，在国家建设和国际活动上作出更大的成绩。
    周恩来主席在他的报告中提到了关于知识分子的问题，说明了我们目前知识分子的力量，无论在数量上、业务能力上、政治觉悟上，都还不能适应国家建设急速发展的需要；而若干政府部门对于知识分子的使用和待遇，还有某些不合理的现象，又在不同程度上妨碍了知识分子力量的充分发挥。中共中央最近已经召开了一次关于知识分子问题的会议，决定要用大力来加强领导，对于科学研究、工程技术、医药卫生、教育、文学艺术等各方面的工作进行全面规划，务必使现在存在着的问题尽可能迅速地得到解决，使知识分子的力量得到充分的发挥和成长，使各种最重要、最必需的知识部门，特别是最急需的科学部门，能在12年内接近世界的先进水平。
    中共中央的这个决定是十分令人振奋的。对于知识分子更是这样。据我所知道，除掉极少数的落后分子以外，绝大多数的知识分子，都以最大的热情和诚意来拥护这个决定。我们感觉到党和政府对于知识分子的关怀无微不至，同时也感觉到知识分子在国家建设事业中所负的责任更加重大。凡是有责任心的知识分子，都在认真地考虑着：要怎样才能够不辜负党和政府的期待，来完成伟大祖国所给与的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    我自己也是一个知识分子。常务委员会指定我在这次会议上作一个关于知识分子问题的专题报告。现在我准备从下面五个角度来对于知识分子的问题作一些补充说明。
    一、贡献力量
    由于封建制度的长期停滞和殖民主义百年来的长期侵略，旧中国的知识界，和整个民族一样，在发展上受着很大的阻碍。正因为这样，知识分子中的爱国分子早就把自己的命运和民族的命运结合在一道，为求民族的解放而作了不屈不挠的斗争。爱国的知识分子几十年来在民族解放斗争中常常起着桥梁作用。
    毛主席在“论联合政府”中早就说过：“在过去半世纪的人民解放斗争，特别是五四运动以来的斗争中，在八年抗日战争中，广大革命知识分子对于中国人民解放事业所起的作用，是很大的。在今后的斗争中，他们将起更大的作用。因此，今后人民的政府应有计划地从广大人民中培养各类知识分子干部，并注意团结和教育现有一切有用的知识分子。”这就明白地告诉我们：毛主席和中共中央向来是重视知识分子的。在人民解放斗争时期，大量的知识分子曾经被吸收，参加了革命；在人民解放斗争胜利之后，广大知识分子又在党所执行的团结、教育和改造的正确政策之下，能够有机会积极参加了伟大的祖国的建设事业。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，为使知识分子适应于社会主义建设事业，更好地贡献出自己的力量，党和政府给了知识分子以各种工作机会，并且采取了种种的方法让知识分子进行自我改造的思想教育，把旧时代所培殖下来的资产阶级和封建地主阶级的落后思想，转变为工人阶级的进步思想。大批的知识分子参加了土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、“三反”“五反”等大规模的斗争；参观了工厂和农村的建设工作；访问了苏联，参加了各种国际活动；这样知识分子就有机会通过社会生活的实践和观察去接受进步思想。同时，通过大规模的马克思列宁主义的理论学习，通过对资产阶级唯心主义的有系统的批判，通过对胡风反革命集团的揭发，知识分子能够更加清楚地分清敌我思想界限，提高政治嗅觉。更通过根据“理论联系实际”原则的业务实践，学习苏联的先进经验，展开批评与自我批评，改进了工作方法，提高了业务水平。
    经过几年来的学习，知识分子的政治觉悟和业务能力有了显著的提高。他们在国家建设事业中也作了很多的工作，也有了不少的成就。这是用不着一一列举的。但是无可讳言，我们就单从现有的知识分子的力量来说，我们现有的力量也并没有得到充分的最有效的发挥。
    几年来，由于一时的工作的需要，有一些高级知识分子脱离了自己的专业，担任了行政工作。但是由于用非所学，在行政与业务两方面都没有充分有效地发挥出自己的力量。有的人更因兼职过多，社会活动过多，影响了工作。会议多，临时任务多，也使好些专家不能集中精力和时间从事专业活动。有些人的工作岗位分配得不很适当。有些人工作调动频繁。有些人有岗位而无工作。更有少数的人一直没有工作岗位。
    像这些在使用知识分子上的不合理现象，毫无疑问，对于国家建设事业是一项损失。党和政府已经决定：迅速地改变这些不合理的现象，以便充分动员知识分子发挥自己的专长。特别对于知识分子们不能掌握自己时间的呼吁，党和政府已经作出了这样的决定：要使高级知识分子们今后至少要有六分之五的工作日，即是每周40小时，从事专业活动。
    中共中央的这些及时的决定，毫无疑问，是会提高知识分子的积极性和工作效率的。知识分子对于中共中央的决策表示衷心的欢迎，衷心的拥护，这是完全可以理解的。
    然而，问题要想得到彻底的解决，责任的至少一半，还要依靠知识分子自己的努力。自我改造的思想教育经过了六年，但在高级知识分子中依然还有百分之十几的落后分子。中间分子目前也还占百分之四十左右，人数不能算少；他们是拥护社会主义的，在工作上一般也能完成任务，但是在政治上不够积极。今天社会主义革命已经达到了高潮，大约再有三年期间，便可以在全国范围内基本上完成，为什么占有半数的高级知识分子还能在前进的道路上踌蹰呢？我们知识分子必须作最大的自我努力，迅速减少这种现象，然后政府的充分动员知识分子力量的措施，才能够收到事半功倍的效果。
    社会主义革命锣鼓敲得这样响，我们相信，我们全体知识分子一定不会允许自己充耳不闻，无动于衷。凡是具有爱国热忱的知识分子，处在社会主义革命这样的大时代里，一定愿意在祖国各项建设事业中，发挥出自己的一切力量。中国知识分子的科学文化水平一般地不能算高，但是，我们如果能够群策群力，老老实实、全心全意地为人民服务，那么，我们就会做出一定的成绩出来。
    时代在向着知识分子召唤：为社会主义贡献出一切力量。我们384万的普通知识分子，十万多的高级知识分子，在中国共产党和政府的领导下，一定不要辜负这个时代的使命。从事科学研究的人，应该在国家的科学发展规划下，努力进行科学研究，学习世界先进经验，补足最短缺而又最急需的科学部门，大批地培养新的科学人材，争取迅速地提高中国的科学水平。从事教育工作的人，应该提高教学质量，为祖国培养出大批知识分子，使知识分子的队伍从几百万人迅速发展到上千万人。从事工程技术的人，应该学习先进经验，提高技术水平，在生产和基本建设中，响应党和国家的号召，做出又多、又快、又好、又省的成绩。从事卫生工作的人，应该在几十万中医和几万西医加强团结和相互学习的基础上，做好城市厂矿卫生工作，实现“全国农业发展纲要”的要求：清除四害，消灭九大疾病和保护妇婴。从事文学艺术工作的人，应该努力各种创作和艺术实践，为反映伟大的社会主义时代人民的丰富生动的斗争，塑造先进人物的形象，以鼓舞人民群众的建设热情。一切从事科学、工程、文化、教育、卫生等工作的知识分子们，我们应该无愧于新中国知识分子的称号，无愧于是工人阶级的一部分，把自己一切有用的知识，无保留地不吝惜地贡献给我们伟大的祖国。
    两千多年前的一位大知识分子——孔子的大门人曾参，每天要以同样的三个问题来反省自己。我们今天也不妨学他的榜样，每天也经常把下面这样三个问题来反省自己吧。
    第一问：我们为人民服务，为社会主义建设服务，是不是有不够积极的地方？
    第二问：我们在扩大队伍和团结内部力量上，是不是真正有所贡献？
    第三问：我们在学习马克思列宁主义、学习先进经验上，是不是有高度的自觉，是不是没有懈怠？
    假使对于这三个问题，在积极的方面能够作肯定的回答，在消极的方面能够坚决地否定，那我们就一定能够在自己的工作岗位上，充分发挥自己的力量，提高业务水平，赶上建设需要，完成或超额完成国家所给与我们的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    二、扩大队伍
    要使知识分子完成国家所给予的艰巨的任务，必须采取更积极的步骤和更有效的方法来扩大知识分子的队伍。
      旧时代所遗留下来的知识分子的人数是很有限的，特别是比较高级的知识分子。在全中国高级知识分子10万多人中，讲师以上的教育人员31，000多，主治医师以上的卫生人员包含着中西医在内约有25，000多，助理研究员以上的科学研究人员约有3，000多，工程师以上的工程技术人员31，000多，高级的文化艺术人员6，000多，其他专家们约有5，000。其中解放以后所增加的新生力量要占35％。
    六年来新生力量的增加速度是相当大的。然而，中国是六亿人口的大国，规模宏大的国家建设事业所期待于知识分子的工作，愈来愈繁重，仅仅10万多人的高级知识分子，同国家建设的需要是完全不相称的。
    为了适应国家建设的需要，扩大知识分子的队伍，尤其高级知识分子的队伍，中央正在从事拟定一个十二年培养高级知识分子的规划。根据初步计算，今后十二年内至少要培养出100多万高级知识分子，才能满足国家各方面的需要。这无疑是一个极其艰巨的任务。这项任务主要是要落在大部分现有的高级知识分子的肩头上的。高等学校毕业生的培养，要靠现有的高等学校的教师；在职专家的提升，要靠各研究机构的高级研究人员和各门类的老一辈的专家。
    这样是不是加重了教学工作者、科学研究工作者和各项专家的负担呢？是的。然而这是一项光荣的负担。高级知识分子，特别是从事科学研究的人员，不是差不多都有这样一个普遍的要求——配备必要的助手和学生吗？这个要求在今后正可以得到相当的满足。我们正可以多多贡献出自己的力量来，为国家多多培养出优秀的人才。
    “得天下英才而教育之”，在古代的大知识分子认为这是一项快乐的工作。在今天我们为了完成社会主义建设的崇高任务而教育英才，这种快乐应该是更要增加无数倍的。
    六年多来，我们的教育工作者和科学研究工作者在培养新生力量上，贡献了很大的力量，作出了很显著的成绩。从高等学校的情况来说，全国高等学校1950年只有助教5，796人，至1955年已增至24，472人，为1950年的四点二倍，占全部教师42，066人的58.2％；1950年讲师只有3，637人，至1955年增至10，095人，为1950年的二点七八倍，占全部教师的24％弱。从科学院的情况来说，全院共有研究人员2，483人，其中实习研究员1，634人，占65.8％；助理研究员421人，占17％。这些青年教师和青年科学工作者，朝气勃勃，有强烈的求知欲望和责任感，对于新鲜事物的感受非常锐敏，在政治上和业务上的进步都非常迅速。这是可庆贺的现象。这种可庆贺的现象之所以产生，同党和政府的领导是分不开的；同苏联专家的协助，苏联先进经验的启发，也是分不开的。但是，我们千切不要看脱还有一个重要的因素，那就是老一辈的教师们和科学家们的努力，老一辈专家们的善于诱导和教人不倦的精神。把自己宝贵的学识和经验传授给了青年，是培养新生力量不可缺少的因素。我们希望我们老一辈的教师们和专家们能够充分发挥这种精神。
    培养专家的方式和培养学生方式是有所不同的。培养专家要用带徒弟即个别指导的方式。据一般的经验，一位导师最好只带四、五位徒弟，多了就不一定能带好。这可能是一种保守的看法。带徒弟的成绩一方面要靠导师高明，另一方面也要靠徒弟好学。假使徒弟好学，而老师又高明会带，又何乐而不多带一些呢？政府已经决定，要把最优秀的高等学校毕业生分配到科学研究方面，仪器设备、图书、资料等方面也不成问题，假使一位导师能够带10位徒弟，那么，新生力量的增长，也就会更加快了。
    例如科学院培养新生力量，过去拟的初步计划是在12年内培养研究生10，500多名。这是以一位导师培养五名，而五名中有一名不成器为基数所得出来的数目。假如每位导师提高到培养10名，10名中就估计二名不成器，所培养的研究生人数不是就可以增加一倍吗？这是值得我们努力争取的。
    应该指出，在一定程度内增加导师的负担，对于导师本人也是有好处的。因为，为了克服困难就要多开动脑筋，想出办法来完成任务，因而会更快地提高教师自己的能力。
    每一个人都是具有不小的潜在力量的。我们的先进工人和农民，在生产建设中，差不多常常都在产生新的纪录。六年来中国人民在各个战线上都以一个胜利联结着一个更大的胜利，其原因之一也就在于以最大的紧张发挥了所有的潜在力量。因此，我们希望所有的高级知识分子，在扩大知识分子的队伍上，作到最紧张的努力，把潜在力量进一步发挥出来。
    三、提高水平
    我们在科学文化方面，无可讳言，是落后于世界的先进水平的。但这并不是说我们所有的文化部门一律都是非常落后的。例如，我们的戏剧艺术，在“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针之下，经过短时期的整理，最近在亚洲和欧洲各国的演出都获得了普遍崇高的声誉。又例如，我们的科学研究，也有少数学者在国际上是有相当地位的。有成就的，我们要精益求精；落后的，我们要加紧追赶。一般说来，我们在很多方面是落后的。特别在科学研究方面，我们还有不少的空白点和空白面。这里有两个原因，一个是由于科学研究在反动时代特别受到冷遇；另一个是在最近的20年间，世界科学和技术有了飞速的进展，这样距离就愈来愈远了。现在请允许我把世界科学的发展多说几句。
    我们大家都知道，目前已经到了原子能的时代。苏联在前年就已经建成了世界第一座原子能发电站；今年又将建成一座新的原子能发电站，有10万瓩的发电能力，并将投入生产。在原子能研究的设备方面，苏联在1949年已经建成了世界上最大的同步回旋加速器，今年还将建成可把质子加速到一百亿电子伏特的更大的同步稳相回旋加速器。随着原子能研究的发展，放射性同位素已经在冶金工业、机器工业、化学工业、石油工业、建筑工业、仪器制造业、农业、医疗事业中广泛应用，解决了以往所不能解决的许多问题；同时也已经在许多学科的研究工作中大量应用。在工业中利用重氢的热核子反应，也已经提到了科学家的工作日程。
    随着电子学的发展，自动控制与远程控制也有了极大的发展。在苏联和其他工业先进国家里，高度自动化的工厂、矿山和电站已经相继出现。它不但解除了人类繁重的体力劳动，也大大地提高了劳动生产率。最新的电子计算机每秒钟可进行15，000次的演算，准确度达到可能有的错误只有十万万分之一。它可以迅速地记录和整理各种科学资料和文献，并加以分类和统计。它有大容量的“记忆系统”，可以把过去记录下来的材料复制出来。它有高速度的“逻辑推理系统”，可以按照大量的指令信号来处理材料。它可以进行文字上的翻译工作。这种计算机已经可以有条件地部分地代替脑力劳动了。
    物理学中还有一个非常重要的部门是半导体物理学。利用半导体已经可以直接把光能和热能变成电能。例如把受光面积一平方米的半导体光电发生器放在太阳光下，它就可以发出50瓦的电；把一种半导体热电发生器放在煤油灯上，它就可以产生一个收音机所需要的电。这种装置在缺乏电力的地方有极大的用途。半导体仪器还可以用来代替真空管，它的体积小，成本低，并且耐用。半导体研究的发展，已经引起了无线电电子学技术上的革新。由于大量地使用半导体，无线电电子学仪器的体积大大地减小了，成本也大大地降低了。
    各国在冶金研究方面也有巨大的进展。例如钛这种金属和它的合金，强度比普通的钢还高。它特别轻，是制造飞机，特别是高速飞机的优良材料，在国防上是非常重要的。
    在动力机械方面，目前已经出现了燃气轮机。这种机器目前是用液体燃料或者瓦斯和空气混合燃烧所形成的气体来推动气轮，将来可能直接使用煤粉燃烧来代替。它不需要蒸气，因而也就不需要锅炉和水；设备简单，效率很高。修建一座使用燃气轮机的发电厂，所需要的时间和投资都不到使用蒸气机的发电厂的一半。这种机器不用说特别适用于缺水的地区。
    高温、高压、高速的技术和超高温、超高压、超高速的技术，也正在迅速地发展，并且在科学技术和工业生产上发生着愈来愈大的影响。劳动生产率极高的新生产过程，速度极大的各种运输工具，都正在不断地产生。
    这些惊人的成就只是世界科学和技术最近发展中的一部分。同这样发达的科学和技术相比，我们确是落后得太远。要想在12年内使我国最急需的科学部门接近正在不断发展中的世界先进水平，我们必须采取种种最有效、最迅速的方法，用尽全力来加紧追赶。
    这样的方法是不是有？
    我们的回答是肯定的。
    在这里我们要特别感谢我们的党和毛主席，在这里我们要特别感谢我们的盟邦苏联和其他兄弟国家。党和政府已经在拟制发展科学研究的全面规划，又有苏联和兄弟国家的无私的帮助，在优良的社会主义制度下，我们能够集中大力来进行工作，这就保证着我国最急需的科学部门在12年之内一定能够接近世界的先进水平，一定能够掌握各种先进的装备和技术。
    我们知道，政府已经作出了决定：要集中最优秀的科学人员和最优秀的大学毕业生到科学研究方面，向科学大进军；要为科学研究准备一切应有的工作条件，如图书、资料、仪器设备、科学情报、研究助手、研究机构等。凡是最需要的缺门或薄弱环节都将要迅速地加以补充和加强。在建立我国科学研究工作的基础上，我们将取得苏联全面的帮助。
    这就是展开在我们科学工作者面前的科学研究的新形势。科学家们是特别振奋的，绝大多数的人都有着充分的精神上的准备，来迎接这个新形势的展开。
    几年来，我们在科学研究上是走了一些弯路的。没有全面规划，没有科学情报，没有适当的联系和分工，有好些在世界其他国家，甚至在国内其他部门都已经解决了的老问题，还要从头做起。这种作法浪费了我们许多力气。例如“铝镍钴”这种合金，由于生产部门有需要，我们科学工作者曾经费了不少的力量来研究它的冶炼方法，然而这种研究早在25年前日本学者就已经获得成果，苏联在1936年并且已经进行生产，中国尽可以从苏联获得整套的设备、资料和方法，根本用不着自己从头做起。
    又例如我们要创造半导体的仪器，就需要有一种名叫锗的金属，而纯粹的锗的提炼，对我们说来还是一件很困难的事情。假如我们要从炼锗做起，要很久以后才可能生产用锗的半导体仪器。但假如我们在派人到国外去学习半导体的同时，就进口纯锗，半导体仪器的生产就可以提前好几年。
    就从这些例子上看来，我们有苏联和其他兄弟国家的帮助，有许多科学研究都用不着从头做起，我们尽可以采取迎头赶上或跃进的办法，因而尽管世界的先进水平在不断地进展，我们也尽可以用较短的时日来赶上世界先进水平。
    但这样的发展速度，是只有在今天才可以办到的；是只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的帮助之下，才可以办到的。
    四、自我教育
    解放以来，知识分子的思想教育工作是取得了很大的成就的。由于党和政府的坚强领导、各民主党派和各人民团体的大力协助，知识分子的自我努力，中国知识界的面貌六年来已经有了根本的改变。拥护社会主义的进步分子和中间分子已经各占40％左右，落后分子已经降低到百分之十几，但是不容忽视的仍然有百分之几的反革命分子和坏分子暗藏在知识分子的队伍里面。
    在经过了两千多年的封建社会和百多年半殖民地境遇的长期濡染中，私有观念和个人主义思想根深蒂固，仅仅经过六年多的期间，要想知识分子全部都已经转变过来，那是不能设想的。但是也不能设想，在今天社会主义革命的高潮中，一些知识分子还能够故步自封，踌蹰不进。
    我们知道，党和政府在帮助知识分子进行自我改造上，是要加强领导、大力推动的。凡是六年多来行之有效的方法，今后都要更全面、更深入地进行。对于落后分子，要尽可能地争取和教育他们，对于他们要严肃批评，耐心教育，等待改进，让他们逐渐转到社会主义方面来。对于中间分子，要尽可能帮助他们脱离中间状态，转变为积极的进步分子。对于进步分子也要帮助他们继续不断地进步。至于暗藏在知识分子中间的现行反革命分子，应该彻底肃清，但是这已经不属于一般知识分子思想改造的范围，我在这里不准备多讲。
    在这个明确的方针政策之下，我们希望各民主党派、各人民团体能够更进一步通力合作，共同推动。知识分子大体都是有党派关系或者团体关系的。党派和团体的集体教育，比个人摸索所能得到的效果，更多、更大、更快。六年多来，各民主党派、各人民团体，在协助党和政府推动知识分子的思想改造上是有了很多的贡献的，我们希望对于这项工作今后能够更进一步予以大力协助。
    当然，思想改造是一项细致的、长期性的工作，而它的主要关键还是在于本人的自觉和自我教育。自我教育的工作，在我们知识分子中，应该不断地加强。进步分子是知识界的自我教育中的骨干，应该起带头作用和桥梁作用。进步分子如果不继续努力，追求不断的进步，那就不仅不能发挥这样的作用，反而会在不知不觉之间日见落后。进步分子很容易背上“自以为进步”的包袱，这是值得我们警惕的。兔子和乌龟赛跑的故事，是我们大家所熟习的。在社会主义革命的大进军中，我们希望任何人都不要在路旁睡觉。
    在今天知识界或每一个知识分子要加强自我教育的工作所应该采用的方法，依然是六年多来所行之有效的各种方法。在实际生活中体验，在专门业务中体会，学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习苏联和其他国家的先进经验，批判唯心主义的思想和学习唯物主义的思想，展开自由讨论，展开批评和自我批评，这些方法都要更有组织、更有计划、更全面深入地进行。特别是批评和自我批评的方法是自我教育的关键。毛主席在第一届全国委员会第二次会议闭幕的时候曾经建议：以批评和自我批评方法进行自我教育和自我改造，这是我们必须永远记住的一个宝贵的指示。知识分子的思想改造的工作虽然是一个特定的历史任务，而知识分子的自我教育的工作是永远没有止境的。即使到了共产主义社会，任何人也必须进行自我教育。批评和自我批评，就和空气一样，对于不断追求进步的人来说，是一刻也不能离开的。我们一定要努力创造出这样一种健康的批评的风气。
    然而，我们应该认识到，知识分子的思想改造，实际上就是在社会主义革命时期中严肃的阶级斗争的反映。要使广大的知识分子，把旧时代所长期培殖下来的地主阶级和资产阶级的落后思想，转变为工人阶级的先进思想，要使自己的世界观、人生观和作风习惯都能适应于社会主义的要求，不经过相当时期的严肃的思想斗争便能轻易得到，那是不能想像的。无论怎样的微风细雨，总不免要吹动头发，打湿衣裳。如果有这样的知识分子，连微风细雨的批评都不能接受，那就证明他还没有进行自我批评的决心。空谈批评和自我批评，是很容易的事；但要认真地进行起来那就很不容易。这必须要进行多少次的内心斗争，然后才能认真地做到。我们知识分子，认真地说，一点也不好宽纵自己。我们总要使自己能够经受得起千捶百炼，能够在风暴中行进。片面的迁就不能解决问题，片面的依赖也不能解决问题。不能妄自尊大，也不能妄自菲薄。知识分子必须具有为了正义事业献出整个生命的顽强性。没有这种顽强性，不能成为优秀的科学家。没有这种顽强性，不能成为优秀的艺术家。没有这种顽强性，不能提高我们的科学文化的国际地位。没有这种顽强性，不能完成我们在国家建设中所担负的光荣而艰巨的任务。
    我最近读到北京师范大学陈垣校长写的“我对知识分子问题的意见”，文章里面有这样一句话：“每一个革命的知识分子都应当以共产党员的标准来努力要求自己”。我很欣赏他这一句话。但我想把他所指的界限再放宽一些。那就是“每一个知识分子都应当以共产党员的标准要求自己”。
    如果每一个知识分子都能够同意我这个说法，都能够以共产党员的标准来要求自己，那我们在知识分子的自我改造的思想斗争中就一定能够获得辉煌的胜利，就一定能够提前完成知识分子的思想改造这个伟大的历史任务。
    那样的日子，我们希望能够尽可能早一天到来。
    五、加强团结
    “我国人民应该有一个远大的规划，要在几十年内，努力改变我国在经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，迅速达到世界上的先进水平。为了实现这个伟大的目标，决定一切的是要有干部，要有数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家；同时，要继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量。我国人民还要同世界各国人民团结一起，为维护世界的和平而奋斗。”
    这是毛主席在最近（本月25日）召开的最高国务会议上的一项极重要的指示。毛主席的话是以全国人民为对象的，但不用说其中包含了广大的知识分子，而且对于知识分子有着殷切的期待。我们知识分子的责任的确非常重大。我们有责任，要努力培养新生力量，扩大队伍，才能有足够数量的干部；要努力提高业务水平和思想水平，才能成为或者产生优秀的专家；并且在创造这些条件之下，“要在几十年内，努力改变我国在经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，迅速达到世界上的先进水平”。毛主席说“要在几十年内”，我们不要赶快就松了气。因为在这个指示中是包含着改变经济上的落后状况的，而且既已说明要努力“迅速达到”，那就不能解释为六七十年；如果单从科学文化方面来说，那就应该是短得更多的期限，即二三十年了。
    毛主席在这里提到了团结的问题，“要继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量”，更“还要同世界各国人民团结一起，为维护世界的和平而奋斗”。这所说的是大范围内的团结。但要做好大范围内的团结，知识分子必须同时把小范围内的团结做好。如果连小范围内的团结都有问题，那在“巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线”上，就不能有所贡献，也就更不能“同世界各国人民团结一起”了。
    知识分子在小范围内的团结是不是还有问题呢？
    有，虽然问题不很大。
    六年来，我国知识分子在中国共产党和毛主席的领导和教育之下，知识分子本身的团结和知识分子与有关方面的团结是日益增进的。现在，大多数知识分子拥护社会主义，拥护党和政府的政策，愿意接受党的领导，愿意学习马克思列宁主义和学习苏联，认识了加强工农知识分子联盟的重大意义。这是值得庆贺的一方面。然而在另外一方面也有一些不能完全令人满意的现象。
    首先，目前知识分子同他们所属单位的领导同志之间关系不够密切，彼此间相互了解、相互信任、相互帮助，还不很够。对这种情况，中共中央已经作了全面的检查，并且已经作出决定要迅速改变这种状况。国务院不久将设立中国专家局，负责处理对待中国专家的各种行政上的问题，进行统一领导、统一调整、统一检查督促。各部门、各地区，也都要分别指定适当机构负责处理和检查有关知识分子的问题。
    中央的决定是全面的，执行是会迅速的。然而问题的另一面依然在于知识分子自己。知识分子的思想和立场，有些人依然不很端正，有些人甚至很不端正。还有极少数人曾经抱着党不能领导科学技术的错误见解。事实上要发展中国的科学技术，要把落后的科学技术提高到国际先进水平，只有党才能作全面规划，进行具体领导。党的领导不仅不会束缚专门业务的发展，而且会给这些业务以正确的方向和规划，以适当的安排、组织、分工、配合、检查和督促。这些人的错误见解是应该予以批评的。
    在知识分子本身之间，无可否认地也还存在着一些问题。在同行之间或不同行之间，在不同机关之间或同一机关的不同单位之间，在同辈之间或不同辈之间，都往往有或大或小的隔阂。个人主义、宗派主义、本位主义的思想，在不少知识分子的头脑中还存在着，因而在业务上不能做到充分的相互尊重，相互切磋，相互协助，而往往各自为政，不通声息，不求分工，不相配合。本位主义相当严重的人，甚至对于领导上的统筹规划也发生抵触，这些人只愁自己人手的分散，不考虑国家建设的需要。有的人习惯于单干，不能从事集体工作；孤芳自赏，坐井观天。这些现象的存在必然地影响业务，影响国家建设事业。克服这些现象的关键所在依然是思想教育问题。
    知识分子同工人农民之间的关系也需要努力增进。工人、农民、知识分子联盟的加强和巩固，对完成社会主义建设事业有很大的意义。一部分知识分子经过参加土地改革和参观农村工厂，对于工人和农民的创造性的劳动，对于他们的生活、要求和斗争，虽然有了相当认识，但一般说来，知识分子对工人和农民的了解还是很差的。有些人还轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民，轻视劳动人民出身的干部，这是剥削阶级意识的一种反映。我们知识分子在为社会主义服务当中、要自觉地成为工人阶级的一部分，就必须主动地接近工农群众，去了解工人和农民的要求，用自己的工作和创造去满足他们的需要。知识分子只要对于国家有所贡献，对于生产有所帮助，而且贡献和帮助得又多、又大、又好，工人和农民便会对知识分子认识得又深、又真、又亲。因此，加强同工人和农民的亲密团结，这是一切知识分子义不容辞的光荣的责任。
    各位委员，各位同志，我的补充报告就要结束了，请允许我再概括说几句。
    知识分子在国家建设与维护和平事业中所负的责任的确是非常重大的。党和政府对于知识分子有着深切的关怀和期待。党和政府在促成了农业合作化、手工业合作化、私营工商业全行业公私合营连续地达到高潮之后，对于科学文化事业进行全面规划和加强领导，这在促使文化建设也迅速地达到高潮上，是有重大作用的。绝大多数的知识分子衷心拥护党的政策。我们满怀信心地愿意以最紧张的努力，继续进行自我教育，发挥自己的潜在力量，扩大队伍，加强团结，提高业务能力，争取迅速改变我国科学文化的落后状态，在12年内使最急需的科学部门接近世界的先进水平。
    有了党和政府的强有力的领导，有了全国各民族，各民主阶级，各民主党派，各人民团体，海外华侨和一切爱国人士的共同努力，有了苏联和其他兄弟国家伟大无私的帮助，我们相信，这个任务是一定可以完成的。
