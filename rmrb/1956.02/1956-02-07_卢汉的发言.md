Lu Han's Speech
Chairman, fellow members, comrades:
    I fully agree with and warmly support Chairman Zhou Enlai's "Political Report" and the reports made by the four Vice-Chairmen and Comrade Chen Boda, and I am willing to work hard to implement the spirit of these reports!
    Our country's socialist revolution is at a high tide, especially with the nation's 120 million farming households facing an unprecedented agricultural collectivization and production increase movement. As agricultural collectivization progresses and yields increase, farmers' demands for cultural life will also grow. Physical exercise is an important foundation for strengthening the people's physique, modernizing production, and modernizing national defense, and it is also an indispensable part of the cultural life of the people. I would like to say a few words about carrying out physical education.
    Accompanying the high tide of the national socialist revolution and production movement, mass sports activities have developed rapidly throughout the country, and the level of sports technology has also greatly improved. Now, whether in factories, mines, schools, troops, government offices, or rural areas, there are thousands of young people actively engaged in physical activities, exercising to build and defend the motherland. In the past year, 402 sports associations have been established at all levels across the country, and grassroots sports activities are very active. The more than 1,700 athletes who participated in the National Workers' Games were selected from 1.25 million employees at the grassroots level in 17 industrial systems. 3,228 schools with 1,818,043 students participated in the preliminary-level training of the Labor Defense System; 870 schools with 523,799 students participated in the first-level training of the Labor Defense System, and approximately 80,000 people met the standards. Calisthenics during work breaks can no longer meet the needs of young people in government offices, and many people are requesting to participate in Labor Defense System training. With the arrival of the high tide of agricultural collectivization, rural sports activities have flourished. In Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province alone, there are more than 1,200 teams, and in Beizhen County, Liaoning Province, there are 2,059 young people regularly engaged in activities such as running, high jumping, long jumping, throwing, and weightlifting. In many areas, young people use voluntary labor to build venues. In Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, basically every village has basketball courts and equipment. Both the scale and frequency of competitive sports have greatly exceeded those of previous years. In 1955, a total of 17 national competitions were held. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,745 sports meets were held at the county level and above, with 1,555,627 athletes participating, of which the number of provincial and municipal sports meets increased by 8 times compared to 1954. In the past year, a total of 78 individual events, 16 teams, and 140 individuals broke the 1954 national records 384 times. Looking back at the 13 years from 1936 to 1948 before liberation, the national track and field records were changed a total of 7 times. Now, in one year, the track and field records have been changed 67 times, and the results of some events are close to international levels. During the Second International Youth Games held during the World Youth Festival, the Chinese sports team won three second places, three third places, two fourth places, four fifth places, and two sixth places, and the national flag of our country was raised 6 times on the sports field; at the 1955 International Friendship Shooting Competition, the Chinese shooting team, in addition to winning fourth place in the overall score, the men's military combat rifle won second place in the overall score, and Li Suping won the women's self-selected small-caliber sports rifle standing shooting championship, and the national flag of our country was raised 8 times on the shooting range.
    Due to the widespread development of sports activities, it has had a significant effect on improving the people's health, enhancing the people's physique, promoting production, improving work and study efficiency, and raising communist consciousness.
    However, under the new situation where the socialist enthusiasm of the people across the country is unprecedentedly high, and they are working together to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and striving to complete the socialist revolution throughout the country, the people are required to have stronger bodies, be able to undertake arduous and complex labor, and be able to defend the sacred task of the motherland. At present, although the health of our people has been greatly improved compared with before liberation, it still cannot meet the needs of the ever-developing economic construction and national defense construction. Last year, among the young people who enlisted in the army, a considerable number failed to join the army because their physical conditions were not up to standard. We have planned the production of industrial machines, agricultural machines, airplanes, tanks, etc., but if there are no strong and high-quality young people to drive them, the machines cannot turn and the tanks cannot move. Therefore, improving the people's health and enhancing the people's physique is an extremely important matter. To solve this problem, in addition to improving working conditions and improving health and medical care, the most active way is to start with the development of sports activities. In the 40-article National Agricultural Development Program, it is stipulated that "within seven or twelve years, basically every township should have a sports field and popularize rural sports activities," which is very necessary. I wholeheartedly support it and will guarantee its implementation. How can we effectively carry out rural sports activities and guarantee their implementation? We must establish sports associations within agricultural production cooperatives and establish organizations to support the army, navy, and air force. This is a good way to organize farmers, especially activists among young people, to lead the masses of farmers to carry out Labor Defense System training and carry out various activities in their spare time. This has long been proven by the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Collective Farm Sports Association had 62,700 grassroots organizations in 1953, and many farmers passed the Labor Defense System and trained 3,756,500 athletes. Collective farms also have their own sports fields, swimming pools and other equipment. Carrying out national defense sports activities in rural areas, such as shooting, ice sports, and gradually developing motorcycles, gliding, parachuting, etc., will enable rural youth to have not only healthy bodies but also preliminary military skills and knowledge before enlisting in the army. After enlisting, the training time can be greatly shortened and the training quality can be improved, which is of great significance for strengthening national defense modernization to defend the motherland.
    Although sports work is under the charge of the Sports Commission, it is a major event related to the daily vital interests of 600 million people and the long-term interests of future generations. It is a cause for the whole people. It cannot be done well by the Sports Commission alone. We must use broad social forces, mobilize all relevant parties, such as leading organs at all levels, relevant government departments, mass organizations such as trade unions and the Communist Youth League, and the vigorous support and cooperation of the People's Liberation Army and other parties. I believe that under the kind concern and vigorous advocacy of the Party and the government, and with the active support of all relevant departments and the efforts of sports workers, it will definitely promote the further development of sports in our country, so that it can play a greater role in the great cause of socialist construction and safeguarding world peace.
    Finally, I wish the conference a successful completion, and I wish all comrades good health!

    卢汉的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意和热烈拥护周恩来主席的“政治报告”和四位副主席及陈伯达委员分别所作的报告，并愿为贯彻这些报告的精神而努力！
    我们国家的社会主义革命正处高潮时期，特别是全国12，000万农户正面临着旷古未有的农业合作化和提高生产的运动。当农业集体化，产量提高以后，农民对文化生活的要求也就随着日益增长。体育运动乃是增强人民体质、现代化生产和现代化国防力量的重要基础工作，也是全国人民必不可少的文化生活的一部分。我现在就开展体育运动工作说几句话。
    伴随着全国社会主义革命运动和生产运动的高潮的到来，群众性体育运动在全国范围内有了迅速的发展，运动技术水平也有很大提高。现在，无论是工厂、矿山、学校、部队、机关和农村中，都有成千上万的青年，在那里积极进行体育活动，为建设祖国和保卫祖国锻炼身体。一年来，全国建立了各级体育协会402个，基层体育活动非常活跃，参加全国工人运动大会的1，700多名运动员，就是17个产业系统从基层125万职工中选拔出来的。有3，228所学校的1，818，043名学生参加了劳卫制预备级的锻炼；有870所学校的523，799名学生参加了劳卫制一级的锻炼，并约有8万人达到标准。工间操已经不能满足机关青年们的要求了，很多人要求参加劳卫制锻炼。随着农业合作化高潮的到来，农村体育活动有了蓬勃的发展。浙江省仅诸暨一县就有1，200多个球队，辽宁省北镇县就有2，059名青年经常进行跑步、跳高、跳远、掷远、举重等项活动。很多地区的青年，利用义务劳动修建场地。像黑龙江省双城县，已基本做到了村村有篮球，村村有场地设备。竞赛运动无论规模和次数都大大超过往年。1955年共举行全国性的比赛17次，仅据不完全统计，就召开县以上运动会2，745次，参加的运动员1，555，627人次，其中省、市级运动会就比1954年增加了8倍。一年来，共有78个单项、16个队、140个人打破1954年全国最高纪录384次。回顾解放前从1936年到1948年的13年间，田径全国纪录总共改变了7次，现在一年中，田径纪录就改变了67次，并且有些项目的成绩已经接近国际水平。中国体育队在世界青年联欢节期间举办的第二届国际青年运动会上，获得三个第二名，三个第三名，两个第四名，四个第五名，两个第六名，运动场6次升起我国国旗；中国射击队在1955年国际友谊射击竞赛大会上，除获得总分第四名外，男子军用战斗步枪获得总分第二名，李素萍获女子自选小口径运动步枪立射冠军，射击场上8次升起我国国旗。
    由于体育运动的广泛开展，对改善人民健康状况，增强人民体质，推动生产，提高工作、学习效率，提高共产主义觉悟都有显著成效。
    但是，在全国人民的社会主义积极性空前高涨、一致努力提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划、为在全国范围内完成社会主义革命而奋斗的新形势下，要求人民有更强壮的身体，能担负起繁重复杂的劳动和能保卫祖国的神圣任务，现在，我国人民的健康状况较之解放以前虽已大大改善，但仍不能适应日益发展的经济建设和国防建设的需要。去年应征入伍的青年当中，还有相当一部分因为身体条件不合格而未能参军。我们生产工业机器、农业机器、飞机、坦克等工作都规划好了，如果没有身强力壮、品质优良的青年去驾驶，机器就不能转，坦克就开不动。因此，改善人民健康状况，增强人民体质，是一件极关重要的大事。要解决这个问题，除了改善劳动条件，改善卫生、保健等项工作之外，最积极的办法还是从开展体育运动做起。在全国农业发展纲要40条中，规定了要在“七年或者十二年内基本上做到乡乡有体育场，普及农村的体育活动”，这是十分必要的。我衷心拥护，并要保证付诸实现，怎么样才能把农村体育运动切实地开展起来，保证实现呢？就必须在农业生产合作社内建立体育协会，并成立支援陆海空军协会的组织。这是组织农民，首先是青年中积极分子，利用业余时间，领导农民群众进行劳卫制锻炼和开展各项活动的好办法。这是早已为苏联先进经验证明了的。苏联集体农庄体育协会在1953年就有62，700个基层组织，很多农民通过了劳卫制并培养了3，756，500名运动员。集体农庄中也有自己的运动场、游泳池等设备。在农村中开展国防体育活动，像射击、冰上运动，逐步开展摩托、滑翔、跳伞等，使农村青年在入伍前，不仅有健康的身体，还有了初步的军事技术和知识，入伍后，就可以大大缩短训练时间，提高训练质量，对保卫祖国加强国防现代化具有重大的意义。
    体育工作虽是由体委主管，但这是关系于6亿人口日常切身利益和子孙后代长远利益的大事，是一项全民的事业。单靠体委是做不好的，必须运用广大的社会力量，动员各有关方面，如各级领导机关、各有关政府部门，工会、青年团等群众团体，和人民解放军等各方面的大力支持与合作。我相信在党和政府的亲切关怀和大力倡导下，在各有关部门的积极支持和体育工作者的努力下，一定会推动我国体育运动的进一步的发展，使之在伟大的社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的事业中发挥更大的作用。
    末了，敬祝大会胜利完成，并祝各位同志们的健康！
