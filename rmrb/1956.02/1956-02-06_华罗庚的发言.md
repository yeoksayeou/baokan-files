    Hua Luogeng's Speech
    Chairman, Esteemed Committee Members, Comrades:
    Premier Zhou Enlai's report and President Guo Moruo's report have filled me with strength, warmth, excitement, and encouragement. As a scientific worker, to be born in this Mao Zedong era is the ultimate happiness and glory. Because in this generation, we will personally witness China's scientific endeavors leap from a backward state to world-class levels. This is something we couldn't have dreamed of 10 years ago!
    First, please allow me to briefly introduce the situation of the young people I am responsible for training. Among the several young people I started training three years ago, due to their active efforts, more than half have already completed world-class work. This is not an isolated phenomenon. As far as I know, the same is true for those trained by other advanced scientists. These facts fill us with confidence that we will be able to meet the requirements put forward by the Premier: to approach world advanced levels within 12 years.
    Secondly, I would like to raise a hope that the leadership can allocate more young people to us for training. Personally, I can work with and guide more young people than I am currently doing. Until last summer, I was only leading a small number of young people in research work, which made me feel that I had not fulfilled the responsibilities that I should and could fulfill for the people. I can influence and help more young people and lead them onto the path of academic research. Of course, the situation has initially improved since last summer. In the Premier's report, we see this even more clearly. However, for a better exertion of strength, I still call attention to this matter here.
    Finally, I would like to make a specific guarantee here: I guarantee that within 12 years, I will establish three world-class branches in the field of mathematics for the motherland; and together with scientific workers across the country, I will strive to bring the most urgently needed scientific departments close to world advanced levels within 12 years. Under the leadership of the Party, the government, and Chairman Mao, we are full of confidence that we will be able to accomplish this great, glorious, and arduous task.

    华罗庚的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    周恩来总理的报告，郭沫若院长的报告，使我感觉到力量、温暖、兴奋和鼓舞。作为一个科学工作者能够生长在这毛泽东时代是无上的幸福，无上的光荣。因为就在这一代，我们将亲眼看到我国的科学事业将从落后的状态飞跃地进入世界水平。这是我们10年前所不能梦想到的！
    首先请允许我极简单地介绍一下，我所负责培养的青年们的情况。在3年前所开始培养的几个青年之中，由于他们的积极努力，已经有一大半完成了世界水平的工作。这并不是孤立的现象。据我所知道，在其他先进科学家培养下也有同样情况。这些事实使我们满怀信心，我们一定能够完成总理所提出的：在12年内接近世界先进水平的要求。
    其次，我再提一个希望，希望领导上能多分配给我们一些青年，让我们来负责培养。就我个人来说，还可以比现在多带些青年一同工作。一直到去年夏天之前，我仅仅领导了很少的青年们从事研究工作，使我感觉到我并未为人民尽了我所应负、也能负的责任。我可以影响和帮助更多青年，带领他们走上学术研究的途径。当然从去年夏天起，情况是初步改善了。在总理的报告里，我们更看到这一点。但是为了力量的更好发挥，我还是在此提请注意。
    最后，我在此提出具体的保证：我保证在12年内，在数学领域内为祖国建立起3个达到世界水平的分支；并和全国科学工作者们在一起为争取在12年内使最急需的科学部门接近世界先进水平而努力。在党和政府及毛主席的领导下，我们满怀信心，我们一定能够完成这一伟大、光荣而艰巨的任务的。
