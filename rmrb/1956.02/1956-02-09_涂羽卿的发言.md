Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

    Allow me, as an intellectual within the Christian community, to address the assembly. I fully agree with and sincerely endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the important reports of other leaders. There are quite a few intellectuals like me within the Christian community. What kind of intellectuals are we? Before liberation, and even in the early days after liberation, we were uniformly intellectuals who were nurtured by imperialism and served imperialism, particularly American imperialism, and who were pro-American, admiring of America, and fearful of America. Whether preachers, educators, scientists, or housewives, this was our common characteristic, the clear mark given to us by imperialism. The people's eyes are sharp and have long seen this mark. But we ourselves did not feel it at all. We even felt somewhat unconvinced when we heard that Chinese Christianity had been used by imperialism as a tool for aggression against China. Since liberation, thanks to the care, unity, and help of the Party and the People's Government, and thanks to the patriotic education we received in various central movements, especially the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, we have seen our own mark clearly, and our faces have changed to a certain extent. The national self-esteem and patriotic heart that we had lost in the past have begun to revive. The majority of intellectuals among us have realized that in the independent and autonomous New China after liberation, only by resolutely severing ties with imperialism, resolutely taking the anti-imperialist and patriotic road, and thoroughly realizing the self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation of Chinese Christianity can we control our own destiny, truly enjoy religious freedom, and truly live a rich religious life; we have realized that only by constantly studying hard, reforming ourselves, and resolutely eliminating the ideological influence of imperialism can we gain the trust of the people and truly contribute to the construction of the motherland. The initiation and promotion of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Chinese Christianity, and the patriotic practical actions we have taken under the banner of this movement, have greatly reduced the distance between us and the people, allowing us to return to the big family of the people and enjoy the warmth of the people.
    In recent years, we have seen how the strength of the socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has grown day by day, how the brotherly friendship between them has strengthened day by day, and how the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of resolving international disputes through consultation have gained the support of more and more people in the world; conversely, we have also clearly seen how the strength of the war and aggression group headed by American imperialism has weakened day by day, how internal contradictions have deepened day by day, and how the imperialist system is increasingly approaching its death knell. All this has greatly strengthened our confidence and determination to safeguard world peace, and at the same time, we have begun to realize that expanding our anti-imperialist and patriotic unity and doing our own work well are closely related to the great cause of safeguarding world peace.
    Recently, we have also faced the high tide of the socialist revolution, and the people of the whole country are running towards socialism. We feel unparalleled excitement in our hearts. The beautiful vision of socialism has appeared before us more and more clearly. We want to loudly cheer for Chairman Mao for leading us to do the extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done. Living in this great era, as the people of this era's People's Republic of China, is truly something to be proud of.
    But while we are happy, we also deeply feel that our transformation is still far behind the people's expectations of us. Although we have done some work and achieved some success in promoting the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Christianity, we have no reason to have any complacency. Facts have proven that American imperialism has not relaxed its conspiracy to use Christianity for sabotage in the slightest. Counter-revolutionary elements in religious garb, such as the Wang Mingdao group, have been exposed in many places. Therefore, the task before us is extremely urgent, and the struggle is extremely sharp. We must redouble our efforts to further raise our awareness, draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, and intensify the expansion of our unity. We must plug all loopholes and not allow the enemy any chance to exploit them. We must assist the government in eliminating all counter-revolutionary elements hidden among us. We firmly believe that as long as we further enhance our patriotic and religious zeal, the rapid development of agricultural cooperation and the victory of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce will provide us with extremely favorable conditions to complete our own historical tasks and advance towards socialism together with the people of the whole country.
    As for myself, I have been engaged in scientific teaching for many years. Looking back on the past, I am truly ashamed. I spent as long as 19 years at Shanghai University alone. Under the control of imperialism, they certainly didn't want us to concern ourselves with politics, and I myself considered it noble not to be involved in politics. Whether the courses I taught met actual needs was none of my business, and whether the students could truly absorb them was not my responsibility. Anyway, according to the methods prescribed by imperialist elements, regardless of the circumstances, about 10% of the students were always designated as failing, and no matter how good the actual performance was, only 10% could get excellent grades, while the vast majority of the remaining students were classified as average. The enthusiasm of young people was destroyed in this way. I myself occasionally did some small research work in the laboratory during my spare time or vacations, and I didn't know why I was doing it or for whom I was doing it. No one cared about success or failure.
    After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of the socialist revolution, I was greatly moved. For the needs of the socialist construction of the motherland, in order to strive to rapidly change the backward state of our country's science and culture and catch up with the advanced scientific level of the world, the Party and the government have deep concern and expectations for us intellectuals. The Party and the government value us, and the motherland is calling us. The responsibilities before us are great, arduous, and extremely glorious. Today we have a glorious goal to strive for, and we should arm ourselves with the most pleasant mood and the most tenacious fighting spirit. Learn from workers and peasants, learn from young people, work hard to transform ourselves, improve our political and scientific level, be responsible to the Party and the government, be responsible to the younger generation, and completely dedicate all that we now have and may obtain in the future to our great motherland.
    I want to assure the assembly: when our Party and government lead us to march towards science, and when making comprehensive plans and arrangements for intellectuals, I want to sincerely and unconditionally respond to the call of the motherland from the depths of my heart, and I will do my best to accept transformation, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, dedicate all my strength, and make a small contribution to this great and glorious task.

    涂羽卿的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    让我以基督教内的一个知识分子的身份向大会发言，我完全同意并衷心拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和其他各位首长的重要报告。像我这样的知识分子在基督教范围内是相当多的。我们是什么样的知识分子呢？解放前，一直到解放后的初期，我们是清一色的为帝国主义所培养，为帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义服务的亲美崇美恐美的知识分子。不管是传道人员、教育工作者、科学工作者或是家庭妇女，这是我们公有的特点，是帝国主义给我们的明显的标记。人民的眼睛是雪亮的，早已看出这个标记。但是我们自己却丝毫没有感觉到。在听到中国基督教曾经被帝国主义所利用作为侵略中国工具的时候还感到有些不服气。解放以来，由于党和人民政府对我们的关怀团结和帮助，由于在各项中心运动特别是抗美援朝运动中我们所受的爱国主义教育使我们看清了自己的标记，我们的面貌随着起了一定的变化。从前所丧失的民族自尊心和爱国的心肠开始复活起来了。我们之间多数的知识分子认识了在解放后独立自主的新中国里，只有坚决割断与帝国主义的关系，坚决走反帝爱国的道路，彻底实现中国基督教的自治自养自传，才能掌握自己的命运，才能真正享受宗教信仰的自由，才能真正过丰富的宗教生活；认识了只有不断的努力学习，自我改造，坚决肃清帝国主义的思想影响才能获得人民的信任，真正对祖国的建设有所贡献。中国基督教三自爱国运动的发起和推动，以及我们在这个运动的旗帜下所作的爱国的实际行动，大大地减缩了我们和人民之间的距离，使我们回到人民的大家庭，享受人民的温暖。
    近年来，眼看见以苏联为首的社会主义和平民主阵营的力量如何的日益壮大，彼此之间兄弟般的友谊如何日益加强，和平共处的五项原则，以协商方式解决国际纠纷的精神，如何得到世界上越来越多的人的支持；与此相反，也清楚地看见以美帝国主义为首的战争侵略集团的力量如何的日益衰弱，内部的矛盾如何日益加深，帝国主义体系的日益接近死亡末路。这都大大地增强了我们对保卫世界和平的信心和决心，同时我们也开始体会到扩大我们的反帝爱国的团结，搞好我们自己的工作，对保卫世界和平的伟大事业有密切的关系。
    最近又面临着社会主义革命的高潮，全国人民奔向社会主义，我们心中更感觉到无比的兴奋。社会主义美丽的远景已经出现在我们面前越来越清楚，我们要为毛主席领导我们作我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣的伟大事业而高声地欢呼，生活在这一个伟大的时代，作为这个时代的中华人民共和国的人民真是值得骄傲。
    但是在我们欢乐的同时，我们也深深地感觉到我们的改造方面还是远远地落后于人民对我们的期望。虽然我们在推动基督教三自爱国运动中作了一些工作，也取得了一些成就，但是我们毫无理由有任何自满的情绪。事实证明，美帝国主义丝毫没有放松它利用基督教进行破坏的阴谋诡计。披着宗教外衣的反革命分子，如王明道集团之类，在许多地方已经被揭露。因此摆在我们面前的任务是极其迫切的，斗争也是极其尖锐的。我们必须加倍努力进一步提高我们的觉悟，划清敌我界限，加紧扩大我们的团结，要堵塞一切的漏洞，不让敌人有任何钻空子的机会，要协助政府肃清一切暗藏在我们中间的反革命分子。我们完全相信只要我们进一步提高我们爱国爱教的热忱，农业合作化的突飞猛进的发展，私营工商业社会主义改造的胜利，都将给我们极有利的条件来完成我们自己的历史任务，与全国人民一道向社会主义前进。
    就我个人而论，我曾经多年从事于科学的教学工作。回想过去实在惭愧之至，单在前沪江大学就混了19年之久，在帝国主义的控制之下当然不要我们过问政治，我自己也以不问政治为清高。所授的课程是否符合实际的需要我不管，同学们是否能真正地吸收不是我的责任，反正按照帝国主义分子所规定的办法，不管三七二十一，同学中10％左右一定规定为不及格，不管实际成绩如何好，也只能有10％才能得优等的评分，其余绝大多数的同学都列入为普通成绩，青年的积极性就是这样的被摧残了。我自己就是在课余时间或假期内在实验室内偶然作些小小的研究工作，也不知道为什么做，为谁做，成功失败也无人过问。
    听了周恩来主席的政治报告和郭沫若副主席所作的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告以后，我受了极大的感动。为了祖国社会主义建设的需要，为了争取迅速改变我国科学文化落后的状态，迎头赶上世界的先进科学水平，党和政府对我们知识分子有深切的关怀和期待。党和政府在重视我们，祖国在召唤我们。摆在我们前面的责任是重大的、是艰巨的、是极其光荣的。我们今天有了光荣的奋斗目标，我们应该以最愉快的心情，最顽强的战斗精神来武装自己。向工人农民学习，向青年学习，努力自己改造，提高自己的政治水平与科学水平，向党和政府负责，向青年的一代负责，将我们现在一切所有的和将来可能得到的完完全全的奉献给我们伟大的祖国。
    我要向大会提出保证：在我们的党和政府领导我们向科学进军的时候，在对知识分子作全面规划安排的时候，我要从我心中的深处真诚地无条件地响应祖国的呼唤，要尽我最大的努力接受改造，学习苏联先进经验，奉献我一切力量，对这个伟大的光荣任务作出一点微小的贡献。
