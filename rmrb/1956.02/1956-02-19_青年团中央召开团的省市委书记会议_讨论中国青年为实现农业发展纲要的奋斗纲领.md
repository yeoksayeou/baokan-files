    The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League convened a meeting of secretaries of provincial and municipal committees of the Youth League from January 24 to February 6.
    The meeting focused on discussing the draft Program of Action for Chinese Youth to Realize the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967, proposed by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Youth League. This draft Program of Action was formulated based on the draft National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967, which the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to the people of the whole country. Article 38 of the draft National Agricultural Development Program stipulates: "Develop the enthusiasm of rural youth for labor and for learning culture and science and technology. Rural youth should become activists and shock forces in rural production and scientific and cultural undertakings." The comrades present unanimously agreed that this is a high degree of trust in the youth by our Party and also a great call to the youth. The Central Committee of the Youth League decided to publish the draft of this Program of Action after the meeting, and requested Youth League committees at all levels to organize the broad masses of young people to discuss it, gather opinions, and submit them to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the League for discussion and adoption. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Youth League requested Youth League committees at all levels to lead the broad masses of League members and young people to immediately take action and join the battle to strive for the realization of this Program of Action.
    The meeting also discussed the issues of leading young people to march towards science and culture, and of mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of young people to strive "more, faster, better, and more economically" for industrial construction, and exchanged views on the organizational construction of the League.
    At the meeting, the secretaries of the provincial and municipal committees of the League and some secretaries of prefectural committees and municipal committees directly under the province made speeches. In their speeches, they reported on the work of the past year, cited many vivid examples of young people in various places in industrial and agricultural production, in the movement to eliminate illiteracy, in the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and in other activities, and believed that the work of the Youth League in the past year, especially since the autumn, has undergone relatively significant changes. The meeting also conducted a review based on the spirit of the Party Central Committee's opposition to right-leaning conservative thinking in its work. They expressed that relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of young people, they have the determination and confidence to continue to develop the work of the League. The meeting requested Youth League organizations at all levels to lead the broad masses of young people with full enthusiasm, under the leadership of the local Party committees, to actively and systematically carry out various beneficial activities, and to make these activities a mass movement of the broad masses of young people.

    青年团中央召开团的省市委书记会议
    讨论中国青年为实现农业发展纲要的奋斗纲领
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会在1月24日到2月6日召开了青年团省、市委书记会议。
    会议着重讨论了青年团中央常务委员会提出的中国青年为实现1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要的奋斗纲领的草案。这个奋斗纲领草案是根据中共中央政治局向全国人民提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案制定的。全国农业发展纲要草案第三十八条规定：“发扬农村青年的劳动积极性和学习文化、学习科学技术的积极性。农村青年应当成为农村生产事业和科学文化事业中的活动分子和突击力量。”到会同志一致认为这是我们党对青年的高度信赖，也是对青年的伟大号召。青年团中央决定在会后公布这个奋斗纲领的草案，要求各级团委组织广大青年进行讨论，把意见汇集起来，以便提交团的二届五中全会讨论和通过。青年团中央同时要求各级团委带领广大团员和青年，立即行动起来，投入争取实现这个奋斗纲领的战斗中去。
    会议还讨论了带领青年向科学文化进军和发动、组织广大青年“又多、又快、又好、又省”地为工业建设而斗争的问题，并且对团的组织建设问题交换了意见。
    在会上团的各省、市委书记和一部分省辖市委、地委书记作了发言。他们在发言中汇报了过去一年的工作，举出了各地青年在工农业生产中，在扫除文盲运动中，在私营工商业的社会主义改造和其他活动中的许多生动事例，认为青年团的工作在过去一年中，特别是秋季以来，起了比较显著的变化。会议还根据党中央反对工作中的右倾保守思想的精神作了检查。他们表示依靠广大青年的积极性和创造性，有决心和信心使团的工作继续向前发展。会议要求各级团组织要满腔热情地带领广大青年，在各地党委的领导下，积极地有计划地开展各种有益的活动，并且使这些活动成为广大青年的群众性运动。（新华社）
