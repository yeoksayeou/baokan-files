    Tianjin Tractor Factory to Produce First Batch of Tractors Early Next Year
    The trial production schedule recently determined by the state-owned Tianjin Tractor Factory indicates that the first batch of tractors will be produced in early 1957. Currently, design personnel are starting to use physical surveying methods, dismantling several tractor samples, and first designing the part drawings that require the cooperation of other factories to ensure the timely completion of the trial production plan. After the foundry workers produce two parts, the cylinder liner and the flywheel body, they plan to produce six more parts in March. The main cadres of the factory are handling order contracts and establishing production cooperation relationships with other factories. The cadres responsible for material supply are also actively purchasing the equipment needed to manufacture tractors from various places.

    天津拖拉机制造厂
    将在明年初出产第一批拖拉机
    国营天津拖拉机制造厂最近确定的试制进度计划表明，第一批拖拉机将在1957年初生产出来。现在，设计人员开始采用实物测绘的办法，把几台拖拉机样品拆散，首先设计那些需要组织其他工厂协作生产的零件图纸，以保证按期完成试制计划。铸工们做出汽缸套筒和飞轮本体两个零件以后，计划在3月份内再做出6个零件。厂里的主要干部，正在办理订货合同，并且和其他工厂建立生产协作关系。负责材料供应工作的干部，也积极从各地采购制造拖拉机需要的器材。
