    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, February 28th – People throughout the Soviet Union are enthusiastically supporting the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. From Sakhalin Island to the Baltic Sea, from Central Asia to the Arctic Circle, rallies and symposiums celebrating the completion of the work of the 20th CPSU Congress are being held in a surge of political and labor enthusiasm. The workers of Soviet cities and villages are expressing their unanimous unity around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Party's Central Committee.

    In Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv, Minsk, Baku, Tashkent, Vilnius, Kishinev, Gorky, Irkutsk, Zaporozhye, Tula, and other cities, in the rural areas of Altai, and on the newly cultivated state farms of Kazakhstan, workers unanimously believe that the resolutions of the 20th CPSU Congress embody the Leninist policy of building communism in the Soviet Union, consolidating the friendship of the Soviet nationalities, and strengthening the socialist camp. Everywhere, the socialist competition to complete the 1956 plan ahead of schedule is being launched with renewed vigor.

    A 200,000-person parade was held in Chelyabinsk, and at a citywide mass rally, Ural workers expressed their boundless love for the Communist Party. Speakers at the rally emphasized that the resolutions of the 20th CPSU Congress inspire hundreds of millions of people in all countries to fight for lasting international peace, guaranteeing the further development of the strength of the peace-loving Soviet Union and the further improvement of the people's lives. The rally called on all workers in the southern Urals to intensify the competition to successfully complete the tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan period. At a mass rally at the "Armenian Electrical Machinery Factory" in Yerevan, workers said that they and all Soviet people are proud of the collective, wise, and time-tested leader of the Party – the Central Committee of the CPSU. At a mass rally in the village of Streletsk in the Kursk region, collective farmers said that the 20th CPSU Congress represents the thoughts and will of all Soviet people, and that collective farmers will spare no effort to implement the Party's instructions.
