Xinhua News Agency, January 1st - This year's national grain requisition and unified purchase work has basically concluded. According to statistics from the Ministry of Food, as of January 20th, the amount of grain requisitioned and purchased and put into storage nationwide accounted for 93.94% of the planned requisition and purchase figures. Currently, local grain departments are preparing to conduct a check and rectification of rural grain unified sales work in February based on local conditions, and are actively arranging to restore and strengthen the national grain market work.

This year's national grain requisition and unified purchase work was launched in the context of the vigorous development of the national agricultural cooperativization movement, last year's bumper harvest of grain, and the in-depth implementation of the rural grain "Three Fixes" policy to each household. Farmers across the country are highly motivated to sell surplus grain. From July 1, 1955 to January 20, 1956, the amount of grain requisitioned and purchased and put into storage increased by 1.66% compared with the same period last year. Furthermore, this work was completed about one and a half months earlier than last year. Reports received by the Ministry of Food from various regions indicate that farmers in many areas have an average of 50 to 100 jin, or even more than 200 jin, more grain left over per person than last year. Because the line between surplus and deficit grain households has been clearly drawn in rural areas, the "voucher-based, monthly, fixed-point, quantitative" supply method has been implemented for grain-deficient households, and the quantitative supply method has been implemented for urban and town residents, the country's grain sales volume has decreased by 8,762 million jin compared with the same period last year.

    本年度国家粮食征购工作基本结束
    据新华社1日讯　本年度的国家粮食征收和统购工作已经基本上结束。据粮食部的统计，到1月20日止，全国征收和统购粮食入库数字，已经占计划征、购数字的93.94％。目前，各地粮食部门正准备根据各地不同情况，在2月间对农村粮食统销工作进行一次检查和整顿，并且积极布置恢复和加强国家粮食市场工作。
    本年度的国家粮食征收和统购工作，是在全国农业合作化运动蓬勃开展、去年粮食获得丰收和农村粮食
  “三定”政策深入到户的情况下展开的，全国农民交售余粮的积极性都很高。从去年7月1日到今年1月20日，征收和统购入库的粮食比上年度同期增加1.66％。并且，比上年度提前约一个半月完成这些工作。粮食部收到的各地的汇报表明，许多地区的农民平均每人留下的粮食比去年多50斤到100多斤，甚至有多到200多斤的。由于农村中划清了粮食余缺界限，对缺粮户执行了“凭证、按月、定点、定量”的供应办法，和对市、镇居民进行了定量供应的办法，国家的粮食销售量比上年度同期减少了876，200万斤。
