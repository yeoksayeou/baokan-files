Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 21st: The New York "Daily Worker" of February 17th published a dispatch from Branchville, New Jersey, stating that Nobel Prize-winning writer Pearl Buck advocated restoring the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

In a speech delivered at the Beth Miriam Sisterhood in Branchville, Pearl Buck also said that she "can never consider China an aggressor if it goes to the area that belongs to it."

Pearl Buck criticized the "mistakes" of the United States in its policy towards China. In this regard, in addition to mentioning the issue of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, she once again spoke of "China one day recovering all the land that previously belonged to it." Pearl Buck said that the United States alone attacking the Chinese mainland could never defeat China, and such a practice would be equivalent to "falling into a bottomless pit."

Pearl Buck said that the United States had raised its own iron curtain because it had prohibited trade with China and cut off contact with China.

    赛珍珠批评美国对华政策
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：2月17日的纽约“工人日报”刊载了从新泽西州琅布兰什城发出的一则电讯说：获得诺贝尔奖金的作家赛珍珠主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位。
    赛珍珠在琅布兰什的蓓丝米里安姆姊妹会发表的演说里还说，她“永远也不能认为中国是一个侵略者，如果它到属于它的地区去的话。”
    赛珍珠批评美国在对中国政策上的“错误”。在这方面，她除了提到中国在联合国的合法权利问题外，并且再一次谈到“中国有一天会收回以前属于它的所有的土地”。赛珍珠说，美国独自进攻中国大陆是决不能打败中国的，这样一种做法将等于“陷入一个无底的泥坑”。
    赛珍珠说，美国升起了它自己的铁幕，因为它禁止了它同中国的贸易并且切断了同中国的接触。
