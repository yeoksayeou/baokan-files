    Xinhua News Agency, February 14th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Austrian Federal Government on February 14th, lodging a serious protest against the Austrian Ministry of the Interior's order to ban the World Federation of Trade Unions from operating in Austria, and the police raid and closure of the World Federation of Trade Unions' office in Vienna.
    The telegram stated that the constitution of the World Federation of Trade Unions and its consistent activities are fully in line with the United Nations Charter. The World Federation of Trade Unions is also a consultative body of the United Nations. It has gained the support of more and more workers around the world through its continuous efforts for the interests of workers and world peace. The actions taken by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior and the police authorities against the World Federation of Trade Unions not only undermine basic trade union rights, but also violate the United Nations Charter and run counter to the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world.

    我国总工会抗议奥地利政府的无理行动
    新华社14日讯　中华全国总工会14日打电报给奥地利联邦政府，对奥国政府内政部下令禁止世界工会联合会在奥地利活动，并且派警察袭击和封闭世界工会联合会在维也纳的办公处，提出严重的抗议。
    电报中说，世界工会联合会的会章和它一贯的活动，完全符合联合国宪章。世界工会联合会又是联合国的咨询团体。它由于不断地为工人的利益和世界的和平进行努力，获得了全世界越来越多的工人的拥护。奥地利内政部和警察当局对世界工会联合会所采取的行动不仅破坏了基本的工会权利，而且违反了联合国宪章，违背了全世界主张和平的人们的意愿。
