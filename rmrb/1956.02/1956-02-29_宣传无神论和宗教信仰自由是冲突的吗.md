Is Promoting Atheism in Conflict with Freedom of Religious Belief?
	Zeng Wenjing
    Some readers ask: In our country, since a policy of freedom of religious belief is implemented, is it permissible to promote atheism? Is promoting atheism in conflict with freedom of religious belief? This question needs to be explored.
    What is freedom of religious belief? This means that citizens are completely free to believe in any religion or not to believe in any religion, and the state provides full guarantees. In order to guarantee citizens' freedom of religious belief, the principles of separation of church and state, and separation of school and church, must be implemented; citizens must have the freedom to hold religious ceremonies, and at the same time, they also have the freedom to criticize a certain religion or all religions.
    If only some people are allowed to believe in religion, let them explain the scriptures, print scriptures and religious publications, but others are not allowed to disbelieve in religion, and they are prohibited from promoting atheism in writing and orally, then it is not freedom of religious belief, but the church possessing privileges. Conversely, if only some people are allowed to promote atheism, but others are not allowed to believe in and preach religion, then it is obviously contrary to the principle of freedom of religious belief.
    From this, it can be seen that people must be allowed to take a free choice attitude towards religion, and people must have the free right to express affirmative or negative opinions on religion. That is to say, if you are a believer, you can chant scriptures, worship Buddha, and worship God; if I am not a believer, I can also promote atheism, popularize scientific knowledge, and prove that God, heaven, etc. are all illusory. Only in this way is it called freedom of religious belief.
    Our country is a people's democratic country. On the issue of religion, the law allows citizens to have equal rights of belief, allowing atheists and people of various religions to have equal rights to express their opinions. If the state uses administrative means to force citizens to believe in religion or not to believe in religion, prohibits citizens from preaching religious doctrines or promoting atheism; if the state does not legally protect the equal rights of any religion or any atheism, but uses power to suppress any party, it conflicts with the principles of democracy and violates the nature of our country.
    Our country is building socialism. To build socialism, we must change social relations and change the natural appearance of the motherland. This requires the broad masses of people to master the laws of social development and the laws of nature, and to improve the level of scientific knowledge of the broad masses of people. To popularize scientific knowledge in order to rapidly advance the cause of socialism, it is necessary to carry out atheistic propaganda and criticize anti-scientific erroneous views.
    Of course, sometimes people feel that what they believe in is sacred and inviolable; when someone criticizes the religion they believe in, they easily become emotional. However, as long as you think about it calmly, things are easy to understand. Religious doctrines and atheism and materialism are inherently two opposing worldviews. Every time religious believers explain religious doctrines to people, they are actually spreading a worldview that is contrary to atheism and materialism, and they are opposing atheism and materialism. Since religious believers can oppose atheism and materialism in this way, why can't atheists and materialists criticize religious views? Furthermore, various religions have their own doctrines, and the contents of these doctrines often conflict with each other. If a certain religion has a feeling of "exclusivity" and requires other religions not to promote views that are different from its own doctrines, then the right of other religions to preach doctrines should also be deprived. This is obviously unreasonable! As the saying goes, "True gold is not afraid of fire." Truth is not afraid of argument, unless you have realized that what you believe in is not the truth and cannot withstand others' criticism. If this is the case, why do you still believe in it? If this is not the case, why are you afraid of others' criticism?
    Some people think that promoting atheism is a prelude to eliminating religion by administrative means. This is a huge misunderstanding! In fact, Marxist-Leninist materialists have never advocated using administrative force to eliminate religion. They believe that religion, like everything else in the world, has its own inevitability of birth, development, and demise. When people cannot understand nature and conquer nature, and cannot master the laws of social development, religion has its own territory. And in societies where the exploiting classes are in a dominant position, religion is also used as a tool to numb the people. Only after class society is eliminated, the means of production are completely owned by the public, and people's material and cultural needs are fully met, they can carry out planned and conscious management of social production in accordance with social and natural laws, and the fog of religion will disappear. From this, it can be seen that the demise of religion is only an inevitable result of social development to a certain stage. When religion still has objective reasons for existence, if people only rely on subjective wishes and attempt to eliminate religion by administrative force, they will inevitably suffer failure.
    In our country, freedom of religious belief has been clearly stipulated in the Constitution, and this is a firm and unshakeable policy. In the past few years, the purely religious activities of our citizens have not been interfered with in any way; our citizens are not subject to any restrictions in believing in any religion or abandoning any religion; the state treats all religions and denominations equally, neither giving special preference to any religion or denomination, nor discriminating against any religion or denomination; churches and believers can explain the scriptures, publish scriptures and religious publications, and atheists can also freely explain their scientific principles. ... Aren't these facts a full expression of freedom of religious belief? Freedom of religious belief has long been an integral part of our socialist democracy and is a true and full democratic right. This policy has not changed in any way from the founding of New China to the present, and it will not change in the future. Today, the Soviet Union is gradually transitioning to a communist society and still implements a policy of freedom of religious belief. The prospect of freedom of religious belief in our country is bound to be like this as well.
    Will carrying out atheistic propaganda affect people in religious circles from participating in the People's Democratic United Front? This concern is groundless. Because people in religious circles are not only believers, but also citizens of the People's Republic of China first and foremost, and they should love their motherland. Our motherland is now engaged in socialist construction, and socialism will bring infinite happiness to the broad masses of people (including believers of various religions). People of various religions should enthusiastically support socialist construction and strive to consolidate and expand the People's Democratic United Front like other people. In fact, this is indeed the case. The vast majority of people with religious beliefs are patriotic and support socialist construction and the People's Democratic United Front. They do not lower their patriotic enthusiasm and socialist activism because others hold different views from themselves on the worldview.
    Will carrying out atheistic propaganda create an excuse for imperialists to attack us? As mentioned above, our country has true and full freedom of religious belief. Facts speak louder than words, so are we still afraid of imperialists spreading rumors? Imperialists often distort the truth. They pretend to sympathize with religious circles and oppose our atheistic propaganda, but in reality, they deeply hate our socialist democracy. Their various rumors precisely illustrate the imperialists' jealousy of our country's policy of freedom of religious belief. Such rumors are not worth paying attention to. Look at the imperialist countries. Do they have full freedom of religious belief? In the United States, for example, Christianity and Catholicism are used as political tools; Islam is discriminated against; various religious groups set up education networks, and countless children and young people are forced to receive religious education; many state legislatures prohibit or secretly restrict the teaching of Darwin's scientific theory about the origin of mankind. ... Are these in line with the principle of freedom of religious belief? The freedom of religious belief they flaunt, like other capitalist democracies, is just a trick. In that case, what right do imperialists have to criticize our religious policy? Imperialism has always intended to use religion as a pawn in its hands and understands freedom of religious belief as freedom of religious aggression. If it is this kind of "freedom," then it has indeed disappeared in New China, replaced by true and full freedom of religious belief. Patriotic religious believers are of course opposed to the imperialists' freedom of religious aggression and support true and full freedom of religious belief. Why are the imperialists so frantically roaring and trying every means to sow discord between religious believers and atheists, and between various religions, in our country? The reason is that it has lost the freedom of religious aggression, and it attempts to restore this "freedom."
    In short, promoting atheism and freedom of religious belief are not in conflict and are completely compatible. Not only that, but the freedom to promote atheism should also be an important part of freedom of religious belief. It is absolutely necessary for those who still have questions about this issue to clarify this point.

    宣传无神论和宗教信仰自由是冲突的吗
    曾文经
    有些读者问：在我们国家里，既然实行宗教信仰自由政策，可以不可以宣传无神论呢？宣传无神论和宗教信仰自由是否冲突呢？对于这个问题，有加以探讨的必要。
      什么是宗教信仰自由？这就是说，公民信仰任何一种宗教，或不信仰任何宗教，是完全自由的，国家给予充分保证。为要保证公民的信教自由，必须实行教会和国家分离、学校和教会分离的原则；必须让公民有举行宗教仪式的自由，同时也有批判某一宗教或一切宗教的自由。
    假使只许某些人信教，让他们讲解经义，印行经典和宗教性刊物，却不许另外一些人不信教，并禁止他们在文字上和口头上宣传无神论，那就不是什么宗教信仰自由，而是教会拥有特权了。反过来说，如果只许一些人宣传无神论，却不许另一些人信教和传教，那显然也和宗教信仰自由的原则相违背。
    由此可见，必须让人们对宗教采取自由选择的态度，让人们对宗教有发表肯定或否定意见的自由权利。这就是说，你是一个教徒，你可以念经、拜佛、拜上帝；我不是教徒，我也可以宣传无神论，普及科学知识，证明上帝、天堂等等都是虚幻的。只有这样，才叫做宗教信仰自由。
    我国是一个人民民主的国度。在宗教这一问题上，法律允许公民有信仰的平等权利，让无神论者和各种宗教徒有发表自己言论的平等权利。如果国家用行政手段来强迫公民信仰宗教或不信仰宗教，禁止公民宣讲宗教教义或宣传无神论；如果国家对于任何一种宗教和任何一种无神论不在法律上保障他们的平等权利，而是用权利压制任何一方，那就和民主的原则相冲突，和我们国家的性质相违反了。
    我国正在建设社会主义。要建成社会主义，就必须改变社会关系，改变祖国的自然面貌。这就要求广大人民群众都来掌握社会发展规律和自然规律，要求提高广大人民群众的科学知识水平。而要普及科学知识，以便迅速地把社会主义事业向前推进，就有必要展开无神论宣传，批判反科学的错误观点。
      当然，有时人们会觉得，自己所信仰的，是神圣不可侵犯的；有人批判到自己所信仰的宗教，总容易动感情。可是，只要冷静地想一想，事情也很容易弄明白。宗教教义和无神论、唯物论本来就是两种针锋相对的世界观。宗教徒每一次向人们讲解宗教教义，实际上都是传播同无神论、唯物论相反的世界观，都是在反对无神论、唯物论。既然宗教徒可以这样地反对无神论、唯物论，为什么无神论者、唯物论者不可以批判宗教观点呢？再进一步说，各种宗教各有自己的教义，这些教义的内容颇多互相冲突的地方。如果某一种宗教有“唯我独尊”的感觉，要求其他宗教不宣传和自己教义不同的观点，那末，其他宗教的宣讲教义权利也应该被剥夺了。这显然是不合理的！俗语说得好：“真金不怕火来烧”，真理是不怕争论的，除非你已经认识到你所信奉的不是真理，经不起别人批判。如果是这样，你为什么还要信仰它呢？如果不是这样，你为什么害怕别人批判呢？
    有些人以为宣传无神论，就是用行政手段消灭宗教的先声，这是绝大的误解！其实，马克思列宁主义的唯物论者从来不主张使用行政力量消灭宗教。他们认为，宗教和世界上一切事物一样，有它的产生、发展和灭亡的必然性。当人们还不能理解自然和征服自然，不能掌握社会发展规律的时候，宗教就有它自己的地盘。而在剥削阶级居于统治地位的社会中，宗教还被利用作为麻醉人民的工具。只有在阶级社会消灭之后，生产资料完全公有，人们的物质和文化的需要得到最充分的满足，他们可以依据社会规律和自然规律来对社会生产实行有计划的、自觉的管理，宗教的迷雾才会消失。由此可见，宗教的灭亡，只是社会发展到一定阶段必然发生的结果。当宗教还在客观上有存在的理由的时候，人们如果只凭主观愿望，企图用行政力量去消灭宗教，他们就一定遭受失败。
    在我国，宗教信仰自由已经在宪法中有明文规定，这是确定不移的方针。这几年来，我国公民的纯粹宗教活动，并没有受到任何干涉；我国公民信仰任何一种宗教或放弃任何宗教，都不受到任何限制；国家对于各种宗教和教派，都一视同仁，既不特别优遇任何宗教或教派，也不对任何宗教或教派加以任何歧视；教会和教徒可以讲解经义，刊印经典和宗教性刊物，无神论者也可以自由地讲解自己的科学道理。……这些事实，难道不是宗教信仰自由的充分表现吗？宗教信仰自由，早已是我国社会主义民主的组成部分，是真正的、充分的民主权利。这种政策，不仅从新中国成立到现在，并没有任何改变，就是在将来也是不会改变的。今天苏联已在逐步过渡到共产主义社会，仍然实行宗教信仰自由政策。我国宗教信仰自由的远景也必然这样。
    进行无神论宣传，会不会影响到宗教界人士参加人民民主统一战线？这种担心是没有任何根据的。因为宗教界的人士不仅是一个教徒，而且首先是中华人民共和国的公民，他们应该热爱自己的祖国。我们的祖国现在正进行社会主义建设，社会主义会给广大人民（包括各种宗教的教徒）带来无限的幸福。各种宗教的教徒应该像其他人民群众一样热烈拥护社会主义建设，努力巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线。事实上，也确是这样。绝大多数有宗教信仰的人民群众是爱国的，拥护社会主义建设和人民民主统一战线的，他们并不因为别人在世界观上抱着和自己不同的见解而降低自己的爱国情绪和社会主义积极性。
    进行无神论宣传，会不会造成帝国主义者抨击我们的借口呢？像上面所说，我国是有真正的、充分的宗教信仰自由的。事实胜过雄辩，我们还害怕帝国主义者造谣吗？帝国主义者是经常颠倒黑白的，他们表面上假装同情宗教界，反对我们进行无神论宣传，实际上却是深恨我们的社会主义民主。他们放出各种流言蜚语，恰巧就说明帝国主义对于我国宗教信仰自由政策的嫉恨。对于这种造谣，是值不得理会的。且看一看帝国主义国家吧，难道它们有充分的宗教信仰自由吗？像在美国，基督教和天主教被利用作为政治工具；伊斯兰教受到歧视；各种宗教团体设立教育网，无数儿童青年被迫接受宗教教育；许多州立法禁止或暗中限制讲授达尔文关于人类起源的科学道理。……这些难道和信教自由原则相符合吗？他们所标榜的信教自由，正和其他资本主义民主一样，不过是一种骗术而已。既然这样，帝国主义者还有什么权利来批评我们的宗教政策呢？帝国主义向来打算把宗教当作自己手中的一个棋子，把宗教信仰自由了解为宗教侵略自由。如果是这种“自由”，那么，它在新中国确实是消失了，代之而起的是真正的、充分的宗教信仰自由。爱国的宗教徒当然是反对帝国主义的宗教侵略自由，赞成真正的、充分的宗教信仰自由的。帝国主义者为什么这样疯狂咆哮，想尽一切办法来挑拨离间我国宗教徒和无神论者之间、各宗教之间的关系呢？原因就在于它失去了宗教侵略自由，它妄图恢复这种“自由”。
    总之，宣传无神论和宗教信仰自由是不相冲突的，是完全相容的。不仅这样，宣传无神论的自由还应该是宗教信仰自由的一个重要内容。对于这个问题还有疑问的人，弄清楚这一点，是完全必要的。
