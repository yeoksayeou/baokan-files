We Want to Give the Ancient Plateau a Brand New Look
Zhong Chengliang, Director of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, Zunyi County, Guizhou

Whenever people mention our Guizhou, they think of the saying "No three days of sunshine, no three miles of flat land, and no three cents of silver for the people." This means that Guizhou Province has poor natural conditions, the people live a hard life, and it is a very poor and backward remote plateau. Yes, Guizhou Province did have such a situation, but that was in the old China. Now it is very different. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, Guizhou farmers have continuously improved their farming techniques and fought against natural disasters, which has brought about great changes in this plateau area: fertile crops have gradually grown in the uneven fields, and farmers who used to suffer from hunger and lack of clothing have gradually achieved a life of plenty. The province's grain production is not only enough for its own consumption, but it has also begun to have surplus grain to be transported to other places to support national construction. What a great change this is! The members of our Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, like our farmer brothers throughout the province, have contributed their share to this change. Now we are still working enthusiastically to build our hometown into a more beautiful and prosperous place.

The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative has grown and strengthened in the continuous struggle against natural disasters. In 1952, we started a mutual aid group of 7 households. In the first year of this organization, we underwent a severe test. As you know, most of our area is sloping terraced fields, which "can withstand ten days of flooding but cannot withstand ten days of drought." However, that summer, there was no rain for more than 60 days, and the disaster was very serious. However, this did not scare us. As soon as the drought appeared, the group members came out together, some carrying water in buckets and others using waterwheels to save the crops. As the drought lasted longer, the water volume became less and less, and the water level became lower and lower. What should we do? We connected the waterwheels together, one after another, until we had 13 waterwheels connected, and we still managed to get the water to the fields. After dozens of days of fighting like this, not a single mu of the group's 84 mu of land was affected by the disaster, and all of it yielded a bumper harvest, with a total output increase of 49% compared to the previous year. The individual farmers outside the group, whose fields were adjacent to ours, only had 30% to 40% of the harvest. This not only boosted the production enthusiasm of the members but also gave the farmers outside the group great inspiration. They began to believe in the power of organization and asked to join the mutual aid group. The following year, our mutual aid group more than doubled in size. Although there was no rain for more than 40 days again in 1953, the total income of our 22 member households still increased by more than 20% compared to 1952. After the autumn harvest, when the mutual aid group transformed into a cooperative, it already had 47 households. After the establishment of the cooperative, with more people and greater strength, things became easier to handle. In the two years of 1954 and 1955, drought and flood disasters continued to occur, and the proportion of new members gradually increased, but our output still increased year by year. In 1955, the 600+ mu of land of our 96 member households yielded an average of more than 700 jin of grain per mu, which was double the previous output.

After the development of the past few years, the members felt that the elementary cooperative was not strong enough, and some people wanted to establish an advanced cooperative. After the autumn harvest last year, the clamor for transferring to an advanced cooperative became louder and louder. The cooperative then discussed the issue of transferring to an advanced cooperative based on the opinions of the masses. I don’t know how the news spread so quickly, but as soon as we started discussing it, the masses outside the cooperative began to shout, saying: Are you led by Chairman Mao, and aren't we? You want to take the socialist road, why didn't you say a word? We want to take it too! Some directly made requests to join the cooperative, and some asked relatives and friends to intercede on their behalf and ask to be absorbed. I knew that absorbing this batch would bring in that batch, like waves in the river, one wave chasing another. Not only did the farmers in this township want to join the cooperative, but those in other townships also came. Not only did individual farmers want to join the cooperative, but some small cooperatives also wanted to merge. Our cooperative plan was broken again and again. Later, there was really no other way, so the township branch decided after research to merge all the individual farmers and agricultural cooperatives in the township to establish an advanced cooperative of 1,555 households. In this way, the problems in the township were solved. The 400+ households of farmers from other townships who wanted to join the cooperative had to be persuaded to return to their own townships to organize a cooperative.

When we reported our plan to the district committee, another problem arose. The district committee was afraid that our scale was too large to manage well and only approved us to establish a cooperative of 300 households. The higher authorities did not approve, but the masses still insisted on coming. What should we do? The cooperative cadres were really in a dilemma. After discussing it, everyone said, how can this work? So they sent representatives to the county and district committees to request. The county and district committees asked about the situation and said to the representatives: Okay, we will meet your requirements. If you think you can do it, then do it. After receiving this reply, the 11 representatives were so happy that they didn't sleep all night. After returning to convey the message, all the farmers in the township were so happy that they smiled.

At this time, Chairman Mao's preliminary 17 Articles on Agricultural Development were also conveyed to the township. The enthusiasm of the masses was even higher. We then held a meeting of more than 400 activists to discuss the transfer to a cooperative and formulated a seven-year development plan for our cooperative based on the 17 Articles. We plan to fully utilize more than 50,000 mu of land within the township in seven years. In addition to the 12,000 mu that are already cultivated, we will reclaim another 5,000 mu, and the rest will be divided into pastures, mulberry gardens, and various woodlands; we will merge the scattered households into 16 residential areas according to production teams, each equipped with electric lights, telephones, and broadcast loudspeakers, and establish a private school in each area, and a primary school with a middle school class in the township. In addition, we will build small reservoirs and power stations. In addition to being used for lighting, electricity will also be used to open rice mills, oil presses, and other processing plants; we will gradually turn dry land into paddy fields, and the yield of the main crop, rice, will be increased to 1,374 jin per mu. In addition to the income from cash crops, animal husbandry, and various side occupations, by 1962, each farmer will have an income of more than 2,500 jin of grain and nearly 400 yuan in cash, which is many times more than now, and of course, it cannot be compared with the time when "people had no three cents of silver."

Is this plan too aggressive? Are the targets too high? Some people have raised such questions. We firmly answered: It is not too aggressive, nor is it too high. We have full confidence and means to achieve this plan. Guizhou Province has great production potential. Although the terrain here is relatively high, most areas have an annual rainfall of more than 1,000 millimeters, and the climate is very warm, which is very suitable for rice growth. In the past, the reason why the people of Guizhou lived in poverty was mainly due to the exploitation and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government and the landlord class. The facts of the past few years have proved that as long as we can eliminate disasters, improve technology, and continuously enhance soil fertility, it is entirely possible to gradually increase grain production. We are now building 3 reservoirs, which will ensure 7,000 mu of paddy fields are free from drought and flooding this year. There is a phosphate mine not far from here that is being mined. This year, we plan to purchase 120 tons of phosphate fertilizer to be applied to the rice fields as a priority. Natural fertilizer will also be increased from 1,200 jin per mu last year to 3,000 jin. Coupled with other technological reforms, the yield of rice per mu will be increased to 729 jin this year. In 1957, we plan to raise 20,000 pigs and start raising some silkworms. Pig manure and silkworm excrement are all top-quality fertilizers. At that time, each mu of land can be fertilized with 5,000 jin, and the total amount of phosphate fertilizer used by the cooperative will also be increased to 20,000 tons. Some land can be cultivated with double-share plows, so the yield can be increased to 910 jin. In the future, we will continue to improve technology and eliminate disasters every year in this way. According to our plan, we can reach 1,374 jin by 1962.

Some members even think that this target is a bit low. They said: Didn't those 2 mu of high-yield land yield 1,020 jin per mu in 1953? At that time, only 1,500 jin of fertilizer was applied per mu, and other conditions were not as good as they are now. Member Liu Yinzhang even used a high-yield story from many years ago to illustrate that this target is not high. He said that he used to farm more than 20 mu of land for the landlord. One year, there was a severe drought, and he could not plant all the land, so he concentrated the labor and manure on 3 mu of land. As a result, these 3 mu of land yielded 3,600 jin. After he mentioned it, everyone said: There have been many examples of high-yield production in the past, but no one has studied and promoted them. Now, with the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as everyone works hard, we will generally exceed this target.

Indeed, since the plan was formulated, the enthusiasm of the members for production and construction has become even greater. In the past, there was a saying here called "Women go to the fields, and there will be a three-year drought." The three-year drought is false, but if any woman in the family goes to the fields, someone will say strange things behind her back, mocking her for showing her face. Now, regardless of men, women, old or young, they are all working together, and no one laughs anymore. Thanks to the enthusiastic labor of the members, we have already built two small reservoirs, and the power station will be able to generate electricity in April.

Our Red Star Cooperative is changing day by day, and the entire Guizhou Plateau is also changing day by day. In the near future, this ancient plateau will have a brand new look.

    我们要使古老的高原面貌全新
    贵州遵义县红星农业生产合作社主任　钟成亮
    提起我们贵州这个地方，大家就会想到“天无三日晴，地无三里平，人无三分银”这几句话，意思是说：贵州省自然条件很差、人民生活很苦，是一个非常贫困和落后的荒僻高原。是的，贵州省确实有过这样的情况，但那是旧中国时代的情况，现在已经大不相同了。解放以来，贵州农民在党和人民政府领导下，不断改进耕作技术，不断向自然灾害进行斗争，使得这个高原地带发生了很大的变化：高低不平的田地里，逐渐长满了丰盛的庄稼，少吃缺穿的农民们，逐渐有了丰衣足食的生活，全省出产的粮食不单是够吃够用，并且已经开始有余粮运到外地，支援国家建设。这是多大的变化啊！我们红星农业生产合作社的社员和全省农民兄弟一样，在促成这个变化中贡献了自己的一分力量。现在我们还正在热情地劳动着，要把自己的家乡建设得更加美丽，更加富裕。
    红星农业生产合作社是在同自然灾害不断斗争中成长壮大的。1952年，我们开始成立了一个包括7户人家的互助组，就在这组织起来的第一年，我们经受了一次严重的考验。大家知道，我们这里大部是坡地梯田，是“经得起十天涝，经不起十天旱”的地方，这年夏天却有60多天没有下雨，灾情很严重。但是，这并没有吓住我们，旱象一露头，组员们便一齐出动，有的用水桶担水，有的用水车车水，抢救庄稼。旱的时间长了，水量越来越少，水位越来越低，怎么办呢？我们便把水车接起来，一道、两道，一直接了13道水车，还是把水车到了田里。经过像这样的几十天战斗，全组84亩地不仅没有一亩受灾，并且全部获得丰收，总产量比前一年增加了49％。组外单干农民和我们地界相连的田地却只有三、四成收。这不单鼓舞了社员的生产情绪，也给了社外农民很大的启发。他们开始相信组织起来的力量，要求参加互助组。第二年，我们互助组便扩大了两倍多。1953年虽然又是40多天没下雨，我们22户社员的总收入还是比1952年增加了二成多。秋收以后，互助组转社的时候，已经是47户了。合作社成立后，人多力量大，事情就更好办了，在1954、1955两年中，旱涝灾害还是不断发生，新社员的比重也逐渐增大，而我们的产量也还是年年上升。1955年我们96户社员的600多亩土地，每亩收粮食平均700多斤，比过去产量增加一倍。
    经过以上几年的发展，社员们已经感觉到低级社有些不够劲，便有人想办高级社，去年秋收以后，转高级社的声浪越来越高，社里便根据群众意见讨论转高级社的问题。不知消息怎么这样灵通，我们刚开始讨论，社外群众便嚷起来了，他们说：你们是毛主席领导的，我们不是吗？你们要走社会主义道路，为什么不招呼一声呢，我们也要走！他们有的直接提出入社要求，有的托亲拜友请人说情要求吸收他们进来。那知吸收这批还有那批，就像江里的浪涛一样，一浪赶一浪。不光是本乡农民要入社，外乡的也来了，不光是个体农民要入社，有些小社也想并进来，我们的办社计划一次又一次地被打破。后来实在没有办法，乡支部研究后便决定把全乡所有个体农民和农业合作社全部合并起来，成立一个1，555户的高级社。这样一来，乡里的问题解决了，外乡要求入社的400多户农民只好劝他们回到自己乡里再组织一个社。
    当我们把自己的计划报告区委的时候，问题又出来了，区委怕我们摊子太大办不好，只批准我们办300户的社。上级不批准，群众还直是要来，怎么办呢，社干部真是左右为难。大家一商讨，这怎么能行呢？于是又派代表到县委、地委去请求，县委，地委问明情况后，对代表们说：好吧，满足你们的要求，你们认为能办就办吧。11个代表得到这个答复后，高兴得一夜也没睡觉，回来传达后，全乡农民个个都喜欢得眉笑眼开。
    就在这个时候，毛主席初步提出的关于农业发展的17条意见也传达到了乡里，群众情绪更高了，我们便召开了400多人的积极分子大会，讨论转社，并根据17条意见制定了我们社的今后7年发展规划。我们计划在7年里，把全乡范围内50，000多亩土地全部利用起来，除现在已经耕种的12，000亩外，再开荒5，000亩，其余分别划为牧场、桑园和各种林地；把东零西散的人家按生产队合并成16个居民点，每处都安上电灯、电话、广播筒，并设立一所民校，全乡办一所小学附设中学班，此外要修建小型水库和发电站，电力除用作照明外，并用来开设碾米、榨油等加工厂；把旱地逐渐变为水田，主要农作物——水稻的产量，提高到每亩1，374斤，再加上经济作物、畜牧业和各种副业收入，到了1962年，每个农民除收入2，500多斤粮食外，还可有近400元现款的收入，比现在又增加了好多倍，当然和“人无三分银”的时候更不能相比了。
    这个计划是不是冒进了呢，指标是不是太高了呢？也有人提出过这样的问题。我们肯定地回答说：不冒进，也不高。我们完全有信心有办法实现这个计划。贵州省生产潜力是很大的，这里地势虽然较高，但是大部地区全年雨量都在1，000公厘以上，气候也很温暖，很适合水稻生长。过去贵州人民生活所以贫苦，主要是在国民党反动政府和地主阶级的剥削压榨所造成的，几年来的事实证明，只要能够消除灾害，改进技术，不断增强地力，粮食产量的逐步提高是完全可能的。我们现在正在修建3座水库，今年就可保证7，000亩水田干滥无忧，离我们这里不远有个磷矿正在开采，我们今年准备购买120吨磷肥在稻田中重点施用，自然肥料也要从去年每亩1，200斤增加到3，000斤，再加上其他技术改革，今年每亩水稻的产量就将提高到729斤。1957年，我们计划养猪两万头，开始养一部分蚕，猪屎蚕粪，都是上等肥料，那时每亩地共可施肥5，000斤，全社施用的磷肥也要增加到两万吨，部分土地可以使用双铧犁耕种，这样便可把产量提高到910斤。以后每年都照这样不断改进技术，消除灾害，根据我们的计划，到1962年便可达到1，374斤。
    有些社员还嫌这个指标有些低了，他们说：1953年那2亩丰产地每亩不是收了1，020斤吗？那时每亩才施肥1，500斤，其他条件也都没有现在这样好呀。社员刘银章更拿他多少年前一个丰产故事来说明这个指标不算高。他说他过去种地主20多亩地，有一年遇到大旱，无法全种，便把人工和粪水都集中在3亩地里，结果这3亩地收了3，600斤。经他一提，大家都说：高额丰产的事例过去是有过不少的，不过没人去研究推广罢了，现在有共产党领导，只要大家努力，就会普遍的超过这个指标哩。
    真的，自从订了规划以后，社员生产建设的劲头更大了。过去这里有句俗话叫做“妇女下田、大旱三年”，大旱三年是假，如果谁家妇女下田，就有人背后说怪话，耻笑她抛头露面。现在不管男女老少都在一起做活，再也没有人耻笑了。由于社员们热情地劳动，我们的小水库已经修好了两个，发电站在4月份便可开始发电。
    我们红星社一天一个样子地在变化着，整个贵州高原也是一天一个样子地在变化着，不久的将来，这个古老的高原将变得面貌全新。
