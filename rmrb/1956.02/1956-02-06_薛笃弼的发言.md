Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I am participating in this Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference with boundless joy and excitement. I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's political report, and I fully agree with Vice-Chairman Li Jishen's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo's report on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of the socialist revolution, Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong's report on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, Vice-Chairman Dong Biwu's report on the issue of eliminating all counter-revolutionaries, and Committee Member Chen Boda's report on the socialist transformation of Chinese agriculture.

I would now like to say a few words about my personal feelings towards the motherland.

Since the Xinhai Revolution, the political situation has been chaotic. I often thought that we Chinese have such a vast land, such a large population, abundant manpower and resources, and such superior conditions. Why can't we stand on our own feet and become strong, but instead suffer the evils and hardships of imperialism? Sometimes I doubted whether I would be able to see our motherland independent, free, prosperous, and strong in my lifetime. I am very ashamed because I did not understand the materialistic worldview, nor did I understand the laws of social and historical development, nor did I recognize the power of the working class's leadership. I was muddleheaded, followed the tide, and floated in the dark officialdom, serving the reactionary rule and being a bureaucrat for half my life. My old superior, Mr. Feng Yuxiang, was a man who held a passionate and sincere love for the country. Although I followed him for many years, I deeply felt that I could not keep up with Mr. Feng's spirit of constantly pursuing progress. Looking back today, I am not only ashamed to the country and the people, but also ashamed to my old superior, Mr. Feng. Last year, the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference and this National People's Political Consultative Conference have both invited me to participate, showing such generosity to me, which makes me feel even more ashamed and grateful.

Since liberation six years ago, the new atmosphere of the motherland has been inspiring me every day, and new things have been enlightening me every day. Since participating in organizing collective study, the guidance of the leadership and the help of comrades have profoundly educated me, enabling me to deeply recognize the brilliance, correctness, and greatness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, step by step. If it were not for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our weak and declining China would never have achieved such independence and freedom today, nor would it have achieved such democratic unity today. Of course, there would not have been such rapid socialist construction and socialist transformation today, nor would there have been such an unprecedentedly improved international status today. For many years, the great patriotic ideals sought by countless people with lofty ideals, revolutionary martyrs, and even Mr. Sun Yat-sen have been fully realized today, exceeding any period in Chinese history many times over, and are still leaping forward at a rapid pace.

Premier Zhou said in his political report: "Regarding the current domestic situation in our country, its characteristic, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, is that it is 'in the high tide of the great socialist revolution'. The people of the whole country are running towards socialism, and everywhere there is a scene of joy and excitement." I came from Shanghai and saw with my own eyes the enthusiastic situation in which Shanghai and the rural areas on the outskirts of the city quickly entered socialist society. At the same time, in order to cooperate with the development of the overall situation, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee announced that all private primary and secondary schools in the city would be changed to public schools. One great happy event followed another, and everyone was beaming, dancing with joy, gongs and drums were shaking the sky, and firecrackers were shaking the ground. The entire city was immersed in an atmosphere of joy and happiness. Some housewives encouraged their children, saying, "You are already youths of socialist society. You must study hard and not be like you were in the past, not studying hard." Some said, "Chairman Mao is spending a lot of money from the country to subsidize your tuition in order to train you. You must listen to Chairman Mao, study well, be healthy, and work well in order to be worthy of Chairman Mao." Due to the peaceful socialist transformation, the political consciousness of the general masses of people has greatly improved, showing unprecedented patriotism, just as Chairman Mao said, "The political situation in our country has undergone fundamental changes." This is truly a cause for celebration!

However, the people of the whole country yearn to see the great motherland become more and more prosperous and strong every day, and to enjoy a more and more beautiful and happier life every day, while US imperialism protects the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which occupies Taiwan, ruthlessly oppresses our compatriots in Taiwan, and ferociously harasses our coast, and sends special agents and spies to lurk on the mainland, trying every possible means to sabotage our construction. When I heard about the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the US and Chiang in the past, even though I was ill, I couldn't help but feel heartbroken and filled with indignation. In order to protect the safety of the motherland, protect the happiness of the people, and ensure the victorious completion of the great socialist construction cause, and in order to defend the permanent peace of Asia and the world, we must eliminate all the hidden counter-revolutionaries in the country, and we must liberate Taiwan to achieve the complete unification of our country. Premier Zhou, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, called out: "All Kuomintang military and political personnel who have fled to Taiwan and overseas should no longer hesitate and should take the road of peaceful liberation of Taiwan as soon as possible!" This is the common wish of the people of the whole country. Among those who fled to Taiwan are my old friends and old colleagues. I plan to convey this great call of our people and our government, which is generous, kind, and righteous, to them, and advise them to make a decision early, abandon darkness and turn to the light, perform meritorious service to redeem their crimes, and quickly return to the embrace of the motherland.

I love the motherland today, and I love the motherland's tomorrow even more. With boundless enthusiasm, I want to see the arrival of our motherland's prosperous, happy, strong, and peaceful socialist society with my own eyes. I was born in a farming family and have been in the city for many years, but my heart is in the countryside. Recently, I saw the "National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967)" draft proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and heard Vice Premier Chen Yi's report on this program. Yesterday, I also heard Committee Member Chen Boda's report on "The Socialist Transformation of Chinese Agriculture," which made me feel extremely excited and made me even more eagerly hope to live a few more years and be able to see that the entire rural area is a beautiful garden, a happy paradise, a magnificent and ever-changing day as planned in the program draft.

Fellow committee members, comrades, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our great motherland has made brilliant and outstanding achievements in all aspects in the past six years. Today, the long-term plan has shown us a beautiful and bright future. This is what I think, and I think everyone else thinks the same. Whoever endangers our great and lovable motherland is our sworn enemy. For the rest of my life, I must, under the leadership of the organization, study hard, transform myself, and together with the people of the whole country, forever follow the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I must contribute all the strength I can to the liberation of Taiwan, the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, and the realization of the great socialist construction of the motherland.

    薛笃弼的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我以无限愉快和兴奋的心情，参加这次中国人民政治协商会议。我衷心拥护周恩来总理的政治报告，完全同意李济深副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，郭沫若副主席的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告，陈叔通副主席关于资本主义工商业社会主义改造问题的报告，董必武副主席关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告和陈伯达委员关于中国农业的社会主义改造的报告。
    我现在就我个人对于祖国的感想说几句话。
    辛亥以还，政局混沌。我常常想到，我们中国有这么广大的土地，有这么众多的人口，人力物力，蕴藏丰富，具备这么些优越条件，何以竟不能自立自强，反而受尽了帝国主义的恶气，吃尽了帝国主义的苦头，有时自己发生疑问道，我这一生，是不是还能够亲眼看到我们祖国有独立自由兴盛富强的那一天？我很惭愧，因为不懂得唯物主义世界观，不认识社会历史发展的规律，不认识工人阶级领导的力量，昏昏沉沉，随波逐流，浮沉在黑暗的宦海里，为反动统治服务，作了半辈子官僚。我的老长官冯玉祥先生是一个抱着满腔热血衷诚爱国的人，我虽追随多年，深感自己跟不上冯先生不断追求进步的精神，今天回想起来，我不但愧对国家，愧对人民，也愧对我的老长官冯先生。去年上海市政协会议，此次全国政协会议，都先后邀我参加，人民对我这样宽大，更使我惭感交集。
    解放六年以来，祖国新的气象，天天在鼓舞着我，新的事物，天天在启发着我，自从参加组织集体学习以后，领导上的指导，同志间的帮助，又深刻地教育着我，使我一步一步地深切认识了中国共产党和毛主席领导的英明正确和伟大。如果不是中国共产党和毛主席的领导，我们积弱不振的中国，决不会有今天这样的独立自由，决不会有今天这样的民主统一，当然也就决不会有今天这样突飞猛进的社会主义建设和社会主义改造，更不会有今天这样空前提高的国际地位。多少年来，许许多多仁人志士，革命先烈，以至孙中山先生奋斗以求的伟大救国的理想，今天已完全实现，超过了中国历史上任何时期多少倍，而且还在一日千里地飞跃前进。
    周总理在政治报告中说：“关于我国目前国内状况，它的特点正如毛泽东主席所说的，是‘处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中’。全国人民奔向社会主义，到处都出现一片欢欣鼓舞的景象。”我是从上海来的，亲眼看到了上海市和郊区农村很快地进入了社会主义社会的热烈情形，同时上海市人民委员会为了配合整个形势的发展，宣布所有全市私立中小学校一律改为公立，一个大喜事紧接着一个大喜事，人人眉飞色舞，手舞足蹈，锣鼓喧天，炮竹震地，全市整个沉浸在欢天喜地的气氛中。有的家庭妇女勉励她们的子女们说：“你们已经是社会主义社会的青年了，你们要好好学习，不能像过去那样不好好读书了。”有的说：“毛主席为培养你们，国家拿出许多钱贴补你们的学费，你们要好好听毛主席的话，学习好，身体好，工作好，才能对得起毛主席。”由于社会主义的和平改造，一般人民群众的政治觉悟，大大地向上提高了一步，表现了空前未有的爱国热忱，诚如毛主席所说，“目前我们国家的政治形势已经起了根本的变化。”这真是多么可庆幸的事情啊！
    可是全国人民渴望看到伟大祖国一天比一天兴盛富强，能够享受一天比一天更美好更幸福的生活，而美帝国主义庇护蒋介石卖国集团盘踞台湾，残酷无情地压迫我台胞，穷凶极恶地扰害我沿海，并且派遣特务间谍分子潜伏在大陆，千方百计地破坏我建设。前闻美蒋签订所谓“共同防御条约”那时我虽在病中，禁不住痛心疾首，愤恨填膺。我们为要保护祖国的安全，保护人民的幸福和保障伟大的社会主义建设事业的胜利完成，和为要保卫亚洲和世界的永久和平，就一定要肃清国内一切潜藏的反革命分子，一定要解放台湾，实现我国的完全统一。周总理代表中国人民和中国政府号召：“一切跑到台湾和海外的国民党军政人员，莫再迟疑，早日走和平解放台湾的道路！”这是全国人民的共同愿望。跑到台湾的，有我的旧朋友，旧同事，我打算向他们传达我们人民和我们政府这样宽宏大度仁至义尽的伟大号召，奉劝他们早下决心，弃暗投明，立功赎罪，快快地回到祖国怀抱来。
    我热爱祖国的今天，更热爱祖国的明天，我怀着无限的热情，要亲眼看见我们祖国的繁荣幸福富强康乐的社会主义社会的到来。我出生农家，多年身在城市，心在农村，日前看到了中共中央提出的“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”草案，并听到了陈毅副总理关于这个纲要的报告，昨天又听到陈伯达委员“中国农业的社会主义改造”的报告，感觉到万分兴奋，使我越发殷切地希望能够多活几年，能够看见全国农村到处都是明媚的花园，快乐的天堂，像纲要草案所规划的那样波澜壮阔气象万千的一天。
    各位委员们，同志们，我们伟大的祖国在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，过去六年来在各方面取得了辉煌卓越的成就，今天远景规划又给我们展示出来美丽灿烂的前途，我是这样想，我想各位也是这样想，谁来危害我们伟大可爱的祖国，谁就是我们誓不两立不共戴天的敌人。我有生之年，一定要在组织领导之下，努力学习，自我改造，同全国人民一起，永远跟着中国共产党和毛主席走，一定要为解放台湾，为肃清反革命分子，为实现祖国伟大的社会主义建设，贡献我所能尽到的力量。
