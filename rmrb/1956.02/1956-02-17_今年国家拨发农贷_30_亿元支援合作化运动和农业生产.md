    To vigorously support the agricultural cooperative movement and agricultural production, the state has newly increased the agricultural loan quota by 1,566 million yuan this year. Adding this to the agricultural loan quota already allocated by the state, the total agricultural loan quota for the country this year reaches 3 billion yuan.
    In addition to the newly increased loans, this year's agricultural loans that can be issued also include 440 million yuan of agricultural loans that matured and were recovered last year, plus approximately 500 million yuan in loans from credit cooperatives, totaling 2.5 billion yuan. This is a very significant credit force.
    This year's agricultural loans are mainly for the poor peasant cooperative fund, capital construction and production expenses loans for agricultural production cooperatives, followed by loans for state-owned farms and fisheries and animal husbandry. Active support will also be provided to members of agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers who are very poor, in terms of both production and livelihood.
    The agricultural loan quota for this year has been distributed by the head office of the Agricultural Bank of China to various provinces. Local agricultural banks are actively preparing for the work of issuing loans.

    今年国家拨发农贷30亿元支援合作化运动和农业生产
    本报讯　为了大力支援农业合作化运动和农业生产，今年国家新增加农业贷款指标156，600万元，加上国家原来已经拨给的农业贷款指标，今年全国的农业贷款总指标共达30亿元。
    今年全国能够发放的农业贷款，除新增加的贷款以外，还有去年已经收回的到期农业贷款4.4亿元，再加上信用合作社的放款约5亿元，总数达到25亿元。这是一个很大的信贷力量。
    今年的农业贷款主要是贫农合作基金、农业生产合作社的基本建设和生产费用贷款，其次是国营农场和渔业、牧业贷款。对于非常穷困的农业生产合作社社员、个体农民也积极在生产和生活上给以支持。
    今年的农业贷款指标已经由中国农业银行总行分配到各省。各地农业银行正在积极准备发放贷款的工作。
