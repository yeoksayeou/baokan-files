To the Editor:

From January 9th to January 30th, 1956, our Jinzhou Railway Transportation School received five telegrams in a row from the Railway Ministry Education Bureau. All five telegrams concerned the same matter: the Railway Ministry Education Bureau, the Political Department Propaganda Department, and the All-China Railway Workers' Union Propaganda Department were jointly holding a railway employee's spare-time education work conference.

The first telegram was sent on January 9th, with a total of 636 characters. This telegram notified that the railway employee's spare-time education work conference would be held on January 25th, requesting relevant departments of railways across the country to send people to participate.

On January 16th, a second telegram was sent, with a total of 191 characters. This telegram notified that the spare-time education work conference would be changed to a telephone conference and documents would be issued, and all units should first send the 12-year plan for spare-time education of employees and related materials. As for the time of the meeting, the telegram said "to be notified separately after a decision."

The third telegram, issued on January 25th, notified that the meeting would be held at 2 p.m. on January 27th; this telegram was also as long as 265 characters.

However, the next day, January 26th, the fourth telegram notified that the meeting was "postponed due to some reason."

Finally, on January 30th, the fifth telegram notified that the meeting would be held at 1 p.m. on January 30th. This time, the meeting was finally held on time.

The Railway Ministry Education Bureau, in order to hold such a meeting, sent a total of five telegrams with more than a thousand characters to railway departments across the country. This is clearly inappropriate. We hope they will seriously examine this issue.

    铁道部教育局滥发电报编辑同志：
    从1956年1月9日到1月30日，我们锦州铁路运输学校连续接到铁道部教育局发来的5封电报。这5封电报谈的都是一件事：铁道部教育局、政治部宣传部和中国铁路工会全国委员会宣传部要联合召开铁路职工业余教育工作会议。
    第一封电报是1月9日发出的，全文共636个字。这封电报通知说：1月25日将召开铁路职工业余教育工作会议，要求全国铁路有关部门派人参加。
    1月16日，又发出了第2封电报，全文共191个字。这封电报通知说：职工业余教育工作会议改用电话会议和文件下达的方式，各单位应先把有关职工业余教育的12年规划和有关资料寄去。至于开会时间，电报说是“决定后另行通知”。
    1月25日发出的第3封电报通知将在1月27日下午2时召开；而这封电报也长达265字。
    但是第2天，1月26日，第4封电报又通知说会议“因故改期举行”。
    直到了1月30日，第5封电报通知会议在1月30日下午1时召开，这一次，会议总算按时举行了。
    铁道部教育局为了开这样一个会，就向全国铁道部门连续发了电文总共在千字以上的5封电报。这显然是不应该的。希望他们对这个问题认真检查一下。
