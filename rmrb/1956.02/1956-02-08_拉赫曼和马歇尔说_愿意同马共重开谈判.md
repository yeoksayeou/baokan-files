    Rahman and Marshall Say
    Willing to Reopen Negotiations with the Malayan Communist Party
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from London: The Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Rahman, said that he is willing to reopen negotiations with the leaders of the Malayan Communist Party at any time. However, he also said: "They must surrender unconditionally." But this has already been firmly rejected by the Malayan Communist Party.
    Rahman made these remarks in an interview with Arthur Clegg, the international affairs editor of the London "Worker's Daily." The "Worker's Daily" published his conversation on February 6.
    Rahman also told Clegg: "My task is to build my country, not to eliminate communism."
    According to a report by United Press International, the Chief Minister of Singapore, Marshall, issued a statement on February 6 regarding Rahman's speech in London, saying that he is willing to meet with the leaders of the Malayan Communist Party again to find a way to end the war in Malaya.
