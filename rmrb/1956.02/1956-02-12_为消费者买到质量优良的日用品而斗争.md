    Striving to Ensure Consumers Can Purchase High-Quality Daily Necessities
    Huang Hongnian, Manager of China Department Store
    With the continuous improvement of industrial and agricultural production, the people's demand for daily consumer goods is increasing day by day. However, in the past year or two, the quality of certain daily consumer goods on the market has been very poor. For example, the soles of some canvas shoes are prone to blistering and the side strips are prone to falling off. The heels and arches of some all-rubber shoes are prone to breaking and cracking. The bladders of some bamboo-cased thermos bottles are extremely prone to explosion, and consumers call these commodities "time bombs"; some only keep warm for four or five hours, and some do not keep warm at all. The phenomenon of glass deterioration and mildew is very serious, and the breakage rate is very high. Consumers who bought bicycles from some factories reported: "After riding for three months, the bell that should ring doesn't ring, and the places that shouldn't ring ring." Some tires crack. Some toothpaste leaks. Some soaps lose their fragrance after a few days of use, and consumers call this soap "fragrant skin soap." Some enamel mugs have lids that don't fit, and the bottoms of the cups are rough and uneven, wobbling on the table, which consumers call "tumbler" mugs. The phenomena of deformation and discoloration are very serious in some knitwear. After wearing some flannelette shirts and undershirts a few times, the sleeves and trouser legs turn into bell bottoms. Some woolen yarn colors are not fast, and after being knitted into woolen clothes, they become mottled.
    Poor commodity quality not only causes consumer dissatisfaction, but also hinders commercial departments from expanding commodity circulation because inferior goods cannot be sold. For example, the sales volume of goods such as rubber shoes, soap, enamel basins, and glass in department stores in 1955 was lower than or only equal to that in 1954. The inventory of some commodities in department stores is almost 50% of the total national output in 1955. If commodities cannot be sold, national funds will be tied up, and commercial departments will bear huge interest losses. Moreover, if commodities are stockpiled for a long time, they are prone to deterioration, and department stores have to lower prices or even sell them at a loss. For example, after glass deteriorates and becomes moldy, no one wants it, so department stores have to sell it to factories that manufacture glass bottles as raw materials for remelting. In 1955, department stores lost more than 4 million yuan due to poor glass quality alone.
    The poor quality of daily consumer goods is mainly due to some production units prioritizing weight over quality and adopting an attitude of disavowing responsibility for products once they leave the factory. For example, regarding the problem of glass deterioration, commercial departments informed the Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of consumer opinions in the second half of 1954. The Building Materials Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the China Department Store jointly sent people to investigate key consumer areas across the country, proving that the glass quality was indeed caused by shortcomings in production. However, the four glass factories in Shenyang, Tianjin, Dalian, and Shanghai under the bureau have not seriously inspected and improved product quality, and have repeatedly emphasized that the poor quality of glass products is mainly due to poor storage by commercial departments. From the perspective of department stores, they have not paid enough attention to the poor quality of daily necessities, lack a strict acceptance system, and have not implemented the principle of pricing according to quality in processing orders and procurement, so that similar products with different qualities receive the same price, which has encouraged some factories to ignore product quality. Therefore, to improve the quality of daily necessities, in addition to production units taking active measures, we in the department store system must also do the following aspects of work and actively strive for the people to buy high-quality daily necessities.
    First, we should clearly recognize the important task of socialist commercial workers, which is to promote the development of industrial production, continuously improve commodity quality, and continuously increase new varieties in the expansion of commodity sales to meet the needs of the broad masses of consumers. To this end, it is necessary to establish and improve the contract system in processing and ordering work. In processing and ordering work, no matter what kind of commodity it is, the purchasing and supply station must sign a contract with the production unit based on consumer needs. The contract must specifically stipulate the specifications and quality of the commodities to be purchased. For some commodities for which a service life can be specified, the production unit should propose a commodity guarantee service life; if the guarantee service life is not reached, consumers should be allowed to return the goods to the store where they originally purchased them or have the store where they originally purchased them repair them, and the store's losses should be compensated by the production unit. In this way, we can urge factories to guarantee and improve product quality.
    Second, due to the continuous development of production, and the differences in machinery, equipment, technical conditions, and raw material supply in various production units, the phenomenon that commodity quality varies is inevitable. Daily consumer goods are different from means of production; poor quality or relatively poor quality goods, as long as they have a certain use value, have a certain consumer base. Therefore, for commodities using the same raw materials, but with different qualities, prices should be determined according to the degree of quality difference. This allows consumers to buy reasonably priced goods and also promotes production units to further improve product quality.
    Third, strengthening commodity acceptance work, especially strengthening commodity acceptance work in purchasing and supply stations, plays a great role in ensuring commodity quality. At present, there is a serious lack of professional leadership, acceptance equipment, and experience in commodity acceptance work. Purchasing and supply stations at all levels should quickly establish a commodity acceptance section directly led by the manager, specializing in commodity acceptance work. Commodity acceptance personnel must have sufficient commodity knowledge and inspection technology for the commodities they are responsible for inspecting. Those who do not have these conditions can hire engineers or technicians from production units to teach them. For some commodities that can be inspected with instruments, instruments should be gradually used to replace unscientific acceptance methods such as touching with hands, looking with eyes, and smelling with noses. During acceptance, strict acceptance should be carried out according to the provisions of the contract, and unqualified ones should be resolutely refused.

    为消费者买到质量优良的日用品而斗争
    中国百货公司经理　黄洪年
    随着工农业生产的不断提高，人民群众对日用消费品的需要，一天比一天增加了。但是，近一、二年来市场上的某些日用消费品的质量很不好。如有些布胶鞋底子容易起泡，边条容易脱落。有些全胶鞋的后跟和脚弯处容易折断和裂缝。有些竹壳水瓶的瓶胆极易爆炸，消费者把这种商品叫做“定时炸弹”；有的只保暖四、五小时，有的根本不能保暖。玻璃变质发霉现象十分严重，破碎率很大。有些工厂出的自行车，消费者买去后反映：“骑了三个月，该响的铃子不响了，不该响的地方倒响起来了”。有些轮胎裂缝。有些牙膏漏水。有些香皂使用几天后就没有香味了，消费者把这种香皂叫做“香皮皂”。有的搪瓷口杯盖子盖不上，杯底粗糙不平，放在桌上东摇西摆，被消费者称为“不倒翁”口杯。有些针织品变形、脱色的现象很严重。有些绒衣、汗衫穿上几回，袖子、裤筒就变成了喇叭筒。有的绒线颜色不牢，织成绒衣后变成了花的。
    商品质量不好，不仅引起消费者的不满，而且由于次货卖不出去，妨碍了商业部门扩大商品流转。如百货公司1955年胶鞋、香皂、搪瓷面盆，玻璃等五、六种商品的销售量都低于或仅等于1954年。百货公司有些商品库存量几乎达到1955年全国生产总量的50％。商品卖不出去，国家资金就被积压，商业部门就担负巨大的利息损失。而且商品积压久了就容易变质，百货公司不得不降低价格甚至赔钱出售。如玻璃发霉变质后，没人要，百货公司只好把它当作玻璃渣卖给制造玻璃瓶的工厂作回炉原料。1955年百货公司仅因玻璃质量不好就损失了400万元以上。
    日用消费品的质量不好，主要是由于一些生产单位重量不重质，对产品抱着出门不认货的态度。如玻璃变质问题，商业部门在1954年下半年就把消费者的意见告诉重工业部建筑材料工业管理局了，重工业部建筑材料工业管理局和中国百货公司并共同派人到全国重点消费地区调查，证明玻璃质量确实是因生产中的缺点所引起的。但是该局所属沈阳、天津、大连、上海四个玻璃厂一直不认真检查和改进产品质量，而且一再强调玻璃产品质量所以不好，主要是商业部门保管不善。从百货公司来说，对日用品质量不好的情况也没有足够的重视，缺乏严格的验收制度，在加工订货和收购工作中，又没有实行按质论价的原则，使质量不一样的同类产品都得到一样的价钱，这就助长了一些工厂忽视产品质量。因此，要改进日用品质量，除生产单位积极采取措施外，我们百货公司系统也要做好以下几个方面工作，积极地为人民群众买到质量优良的日用品而斗争。
    首先，应该明确认识社会主义商业工作者的重要任务，就是在扩大商品推销中，促进工业生产的发展，不断提高商品质量，不断增加新品种，满足广大消费者的需要。为此，就必须建立和健全加工、定货工作中的合同制度。在加工、定货工作中，不论是哪一种商品，采购供应站都必须根据消费者需要，和生产单位订立合同。在合同中必须具体规定需要收购的商品规格和质量。对有些可以规定使用期限的商品，应该由生产单位提出商品保证使用期限；如达不到保证使用期限，应该允许消费者向原来购买的商店退货或由原来购买的商店包修，商店的损失，应该由生产单位负责赔偿。这样，可以督促工厂保证和提高产品质量。
    其次，由于生产的不断发展，以及各生产单位的机器设备、技术条件、原料供应不一样，商品质量有高有低的现象是不可避免的。日用消费品不同于生产资料的产品，质量不好的或质量较差的，只要有一定的使用价值，就有一定的消费对象。因此，对于使用同样原料，但质量有差别的商品，应该根据质量差别程度，按质论价。这样可以使消费者买到价钱公道的东西，也可以促使生产单位进一步提高产品质量。
    第三，加强商品验收工作，特别是加强采购供应站的商品验收工作，这对保证商品质量有极大作用。目前在商品验收工作方面缺乏专业领导和缺乏验收设备和经验的现象很严重。各级采购供应站应该迅速成立由经理直接领导的商品验收科，专门负责商品验收工作。商品验收人员对自己负责检验的商品必须具有足够的商品知识和检验技术。不具备这个条件的，可以聘请生产单位的工程师或技术人员讲授。有些能够用仪器检验的商品，应该逐渐用仪器来代替手摸、眼看、鼻子嗅等不科学的验收方法。在验收时，应该根据合同规定严格验收，对不合格的坚决拒绝接收。
