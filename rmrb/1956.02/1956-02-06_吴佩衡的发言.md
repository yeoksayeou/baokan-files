Wu Peicheng's Speech

Chairman, fellow members, comrades:

I am a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. I feel infinitely honored and extremely excited to be able to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I listened to Premier Zhou's political report and the reports of various leaders, and I realized that the content was extremely rich. Issues such as the analysis of the international situation, the characteristics of the domestic situation, the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, intellectuals, the liberation of Taiwan, and the elimination of all counter-revolutionaries, have greatly inspired me in my studies and ideological understanding. I fully agree and express my heartfelt and warm support.

Since the first stage of the Chinese revolution achieved a great victory and the People's Republic of China was founded, our country has achieved great achievements in a series of social reform movements and economic construction, as well as in foreign policy. The unprecedented improvement of our international status has played a significant role in safeguarding lasting world peace. The lives of the people across the country have been continuously improved. Especially at the beginning of the fourth year of the National Five-Year Construction Plan, in the increasingly surging tide of the socialist revolution, and in the rising tide of the masses' socialist revolutionary enthusiasm, socialist agricultural cooperativization, handicraft cooperativization, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country have shown a brand-new situation and have entered the path of socialist society. This proves that the people's democratic united front of all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic人士 who participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, are united and becoming increasingly consolidated and strengthened.

We medical workers, under the care, education, and cultivation of the Party and Chairman Mao, have realized how to serve the people and the direction of our efforts. Especially under the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to correctly treat the policies on traditional Chinese medicine and promote the cultural heritage of the motherland, our Chinese and Western medicine practitioners have become more united, learning from each other and conducting joint research. As far as we Chinese medicine practitioners are concerned, we feel that our responsibility is even more arduous and our honor is infinite. I have been practicing traditional Chinese medicine for more than 40 years. Although I am nearly 70 years old, I will continue to study constantly on the original basis and contribute my strength to the health care of the people of the motherland. All our comrades in traditional Chinese medicine across the country should give full play to the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, play an active and positive role in the unity of Chinese and Western medicine, and constantly improve our political and technical levels to complete the unified work of our academic work in traditional Chinese medicine. We must earnestly summarize our knowledge and experience, resolutely oppose arrogance and complacency, oppose conservative thinking, and unreservedly exchange with our Western medicine comrades. Although our traditional Chinese medicine has more than 5,000 years of rich and valuable practical experience, it still lacks a modern scientific foundation. Therefore, our Chinese medicine practitioners must also humbly learn from our Western medicine comrades, exchange experience, and jointly explore the medical and cultural heritage of the motherland, and work hard for the socialist health care cause of the motherland and strive to build a socialist society in our motherland.

Now our motherland is advancing by leaps and bounds. Our more than 600 million people across the country should unite more firmly around the Party, constantly improve our socialist ideological awareness, raise our vigilance a hundredfold, consolidate our national defense, prevent the conspiracies and sabotage of all enemies at home and abroad, and with full confidence, with an active, positive, enthusiastic, and all-out selfless labor spirit, rapidly advance our socialist construction cause and strive to transition to socialist society ahead of schedule.

    吴佩衡的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我是一个中医医务工作者，此次得来参加中国人民政协第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议，使我感到无限的光荣，万分的兴奋。我听了周总理的政治报告和各位首长的报告，体会到内容极丰富，如国际形势的分析、国内情况的特点、农业手工业合作化、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造、关于知识分子、解放台湾、肃清一切反革命分子等问题，使我在学习上思想认识上，得到了很大的启发，我完全赞同，并衷心表示热烈的拥护。
    自从中国革命第一阶段取得了伟大的胜利，成立了中华人民共和国以后，我们的国家在一系列的社会改革运动和经济建设中，以及在外交政策上，都取到了伟大的成就。国际地位的空前提高，对保卫世界持久和平，已起了很大的作用，全国人民的生活得到了不断的改善，尤其在国家五年建设计划第四年度的开始，在日益澎湃沸腾的社会主义革命高潮里，在群众的社会主义革命积极性越来越高的浪潮中，我国社会主义农业合作化、手工业合作化和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，已出现了崭新的形势，而进入了社会主义社会的途径。这就证明参加中国人民政治协商会议的各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其他爱国民主人士的人民民主统一战线，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，团结一致，日愈巩固和加强了。
    我们医务工作者，在党和毛主席的关怀和教育培养下，认清了怎样为人民服务和努力的方向。尤其在党中央和毛主席正确对待中医政策，发扬祖国文化遗产的号召下，使我们中西医在团结上更加强了，互相学习，共同研究，作为我们中医来说，就更感到责任的艰巨和无限的光荣。我执行中医业务40余年，虽然年近70，但是我还要在原有的基础上不断的钻研，为祖国人民的保健事业贡献出自己的力量。我们全国中医同志都应该发挥高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神，在中西医的团结上要发挥主动性和积极性，不断地提高我们的政治水平和技术水平，完成我们中医学术上的统一工作，要很好总结自己的学识经验，坚决反对骄傲自满，反对保守思想，要毫无保留的与西医同志互相交流。我们中医虽然具有五千多年丰富宝贵的实践经验，但是还缺乏现代的科学基础，所以我们中医也要向西医同志虚心地学习、交流经验，共同发掘祖国医学文化遗产，为祖国社会主义保健事业而努力，为建设祖国社会主义社会而奋斗。
    现在我们祖国正在一日千里地前进着，我们全国6亿多人民，应当更坚强地团结在党的周围，不断提高社会主义的思想觉悟，提高百倍的警惕性，巩固国防，防止国内外一切敌人的阴谋破坏，满怀信心地，以主动的、积极的、热情的、全力以赴忘我劳动的精神，把我们的社会主义建设事业飞速向前推进，争取提前过渡到社会主义社会。
