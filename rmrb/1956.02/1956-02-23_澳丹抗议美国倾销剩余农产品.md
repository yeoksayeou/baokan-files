Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd, Washington dispatch: Australia has lodged a new strong protest with the United States, expressing opposition to the US dumping of surplus agricultural products. The protest states that the US government's policy on handling surplus agricultural products is harming Australia's international trade.

According to a Reuters report on February 22nd, the protest was delivered to the US State Department earlier this week by the Australian Ambassador to the United States, Spender. Prior to this, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries had already lodged a series of similar formal protests with the United States.

Reuters said that Australia's recent protest was due to the US International Cooperation Administration's proposal to handle surplus wheat and similar products in Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen dispatch: The Danish government announced that on February 15th, Danish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen protested to the US Ambassador to Denmark against the US dumping of surplus American butter in traditional Danish markets.

Hansen stated at the time that the US dumping of butter in Denmark's traditional foreign markets – France, West Germany, and Finland – has caused concern in Denmark. As a result of the US dumping of 3,200 tons of surplus butter in West Germany, it is estimated that Denmark's butter exports to West Germany will decrease by 3,000 tons in the first quarter of this year.

    澳丹抗议美国倾销剩余农产品
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：澳大利亚向美国提出了一项新的强硬抗议，表示反对美国倾销剩余农产品。抗议说，美国政府处理剩余农产品的政策正在损害澳大利亚的国际贸易。
    据路透社22日报道，这项抗议是由澳大利亚驻美国大使斯宾德在这个星期早些时候交给美国国务院的。在这以前，澳大利亚、新西兰以及其他国家已经向美国提出了一系列类似的正式抗议。
    路透社说，澳大利亚最近的抗议，是由于美国国际合作署提出了要在欧洲处理剩余的小麦和类似的产品的建议。
    新华社讯　哥本哈根消息：丹麦政府宣布，丹麦首相兼外交大臣汉森15日向美国驻丹麦大使抗议美国在丹麦传统市场上倾销美国剩余奶油。
    汉森当时表示，美国在丹麦奶油传统的国外市场——法国、西德和芬兰倾销奶油引起了丹麦的忧虑。由于美国在西德倾销3，200吨剩余奶油的结果，估计今年第一季度将使丹麦向西德的奶油输出减少3，000吨。
