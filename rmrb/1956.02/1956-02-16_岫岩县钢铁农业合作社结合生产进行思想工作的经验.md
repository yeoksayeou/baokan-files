    The Experience of the Xiuyan County Iron and Steel Agricultural Cooperative in Combining Production with Ideological Work
    Jin Yi
    Yangheyan Village in Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province, had only a small cooperative of 9 households before last autumn's harvest. Now, it has expanded into a large cooperative of 313 households. After the establishment of the large cooperative, the branch actively led the cooperative to transition to collective production and strengthened the political and ideological education of the members, closely integrating it with current production, further strengthening the members' confidence in running the cooperative and increasing their enthusiasm for production, which promoted spring plowing preparations.
    How does the village branch conduct political and ideological education among the members?
    I. Solidifying Members’ Confidence in Running the Cooperative through the “Three Searches” and “Four Calculations” Education. After the cooperative transitioned to collective production, most members actively participated in labor, determined to run the cooperative well. However, because the ideological mobilization work was not done sufficiently during the establishment of the cooperative, some members still had various ideological concerns. Poor and lower-middle peasant members with weak labor power were mainly afraid of low work attendance and low income, fearing they would not have money to buy grain and would face food shortages. For example, poor peasant Zhao Yongxi (suffering from lung disease) had nine family members, with only one and a half laborers. When farming independently, he cultivated 13 mu and 9 fen of land, barely making ends meet all year round. When the large cooperative was established last year, he was afraid of low income and hesitated to sign up. After patient education, he finally signed up. Some upper-middle peasants with strong labor power mainly had three fears after joining the cooperative: first, they feared that the income would not be as high as when they farmed independently; second, they feared that there would be too much work and too tiring work in the cooperative; third, they feared that pocket money would be inconvenient. For example, upper-middle peasant Chang Xisheng said, "Joining the cooperative will only get me the same amount of grain as when I farmed independently. If I don't join, I might get even more. Isn't joining the cooperative supposed to be voluntary? I'll see how it goes, and if it doesn't work out, I'll just leave." Another example is upper-middle peasant Liu Yushu, who had five or six hundred yuan in savings but claimed he had no pocket money and was unwilling to invest in the cooperative. He didn't work a single day in the cooperative for more than ten days after it transitioned to collective production.
    The branch repeatedly analyzed and studied this situation, believing that the reason why some members' thinking about joining the cooperative was not firm enough was mainly because they were not clear about this year's income. Therefore, the branch assisted the management committee in making a rough estimate of the annual income through the "Three Searches" (searching for potential for increased production, searching for ways to increase production, searching for experience in increasing production) and "Four Calculations" (calculating income, calculating expenses, calculating work points, calculating distribution). Then, the branch had the members conduct a general discussion on the results of the "Four Calculations" and also selected different typical households in each production team to conduct trial calculations separately. For example, the well-off household of Yang Xisheng, with 11 people, 28 mu of land, 1 cart, two cows, and 1 donkey, had a net income of 16 shi when farming independently. This year, his family has 4 male laborers and 1 female laborer, who can do 750 labor days and earn 47 shi and 6 dou. Plus 5 shi for land rent and 2 shi and 1 dou for cattle rent, the total income can reach 54 shi and 7 dou, which is 38 shi and 7 dou more than when he farmed independently. Zhao Yongxi, who was always worried about his weak labor power and low income, can do 200 labor days this year and earn 12 shi and 6 dou, plus 2 shi and 8 dou for land rent, for a total income of 15 shi and 4 dou, which is an increase of 7 shi and 4 dou of grain compared to when he farmed independently. After calculating the accounts, the vast majority of members could increase their income. They happily said: No more hesitation, we must work hard to the end.
    II. Strengthening Collectivist Ideological Education, Establishing the Idea of "Taking the Cooperative as Home" among Members. Some members do not have a sufficient understanding of the consistency between individual interests and collective interests. Their thinking is: The land has been entered into the cooperative, so I don't have to worry about it myself, just wait to work! Some things that have been valued and returned to the cooperative or rented have changed once they arrive. For example, when Li Kuiyuan's cart was valued, the front and rear brake ropes were new, but he replaced them with two broken ropes after they were in the cooperative. When Zhao Jingchun's rubber-wheeled cart entered the cooperative, everything was complete, but when it transitioned to collective production, the bearing sleeve broke as soon as the empty cart arrived at the cooperative. The ropes were also not enough, and the large whip handle was replaced with a "wax" wooden stick. Some are unwilling to invest in the cooperative and unwilling to sell grass to the cooperative. For example, upper-middle peasant Fang Shuxiang, knowing that the cooperative has a shortage of millet straw, sold more than 1,000 jin of millet straw to the supply and marketing cooperative. Others do not cherish public property. When a livestock shoulder frame broke in the Fifth Production Team, no one cared. In the First Production Team, three or four carts were exposed to the wind and sun all day long, and no one cared about them. In response to this situation, the branch organized cooperative cadres and Party and League members to further carry out love-the-cooperative education for all members, focusing on explaining the principle of the consistency of individual interests and collective interests through love-the-cooperative education, and commended good members who cherished public property, so that members understood that to run the cooperative well, they must rely on everyone's efforts, everyone must care about the cooperative, and everyone must cherish the cooperative. After education, many members initially recognized the relationship between themselves and the cooperative and established the idea of "taking the cooperative as home."
    When organizing teams and implementing the contract labor system, the arrangements for the elderly, weak, and disabled members were not adequate at the beginning, and there was a phenomenon of "picking the right ones, looking for opponents, and not wanting weak laborers" among members. The branch explained the importance of arranging for elderly and weak laborers to participate in production to the cooperative cadres, and mainly carried out "class friendship" and "united production" education among the general members; for the elderly, weak, and disabled members, they mainly carried out diligent production and accumulate-little-to-make-more education, overcoming their erroneous thinking of simply relying on relief within the cooperative. And according to the characteristics of current production, they found six tasks, such as picking manure, cutting wood, feeding livestock, driving carts to deliver manure, collecting fodder, and building livestock sheds, for the elderly, weak, and disabled laborers to do. After this education and arrangement, the phenomenon of excluding elderly and weak laborers from participating in production in the cooperative has disappeared.
    III. Educating Members on Labor Discipline and Continuously Improving Members' Enthusiasm for Production. Although the cooperative had also stipulated labor discipline, it was not well implemented, and violations of labor discipline often occurred. Some members were absent from work without reason, and some members picked light work and avoided heavy work. Chang Xiquan of the First Production Team thought that chopping firewood was too tiring and did not go to work for six or seven days without asking for leave. In the Second Production Team, nine people went up the mountain to chop firewood, and each person chopped only 20 bundles on average per day. In response to this situation, in addition to explaining the principle of "more work, more gain; less work, less gain" to the members, the branch and cooperative cadres further carried out education on labor discipline and also launched a major ideological inspection among cooperative cadres and members. Each production team commended good members who had always actively worked, which not only encouraged advanced members but also provided a good education for members who had always been passive and backward in production.
    IV. Giving Play to the Exemplary Leading Role of Party and League Members. There are 15 Party members and 37 League members in the whole village. After the completion of the large cooperative, the branch divided 4 Party groups and 5 League groups according to the distribution of Party and League members in the 7 production teams of the whole cooperative, and educated Party and League members to play a leading and exemplary role in production. For example, when mobilizing members to quarry stones to build a dam, some members initially thought the work was tiring and dirty and were unwilling to do it, so Party member Tang Fengwu (transferred soldier) took the lead in doing it. At this time, many members said: Tang Fengwu is not afraid of hardship for the cooperative, why don't we do it! Under his leading influence, 12 members of the Sixth Production Team who would not quarry stones in the past are now also going up the mountain to quarry stones. They expressed that they want to learn from Tang Fengwu and ensure the completion of the stone quarrying task.
    Because the village branch closely integrated production and strengthened the ideological education of the members and gave play to the exemplary leading role of Party and League members, it not only greatly improved the socialist ideological consciousness of the members and strengthened the members' confidence in running the cooperative but also effectively promoted the preparatory work for spring plowing. In just half a month, the whole cooperative has already chopped 15,400 bundles of firewood, cut 58,000 jin of wood, picked 19,200 jin of manure, collected 3,950 jin of saltpeter ash, earned more than 800 yuan from sideline occupations, and also used 6 carts to deliver manure. Women and elderly and weak laborers are also actively collecting fodder and seeds. All members are full of confidence in striving to complete the preparatory work for spring plowing before March 20 and transition to spring plowing and sowing.

    岫岩县钢铁农业合作社结合生产进行思想工作的经验
    金义
    辽宁省岫岩县洋河沿村，去年秋收以前只有一个9户的小社，现在已经扩大成一个313户的大社了。大社建成之后，支部就积极地领导合作社转入了集体生产，并且紧紧地结合当前生产加强了社员的政治思想教育工作，进一步坚定了社员的办社信心，提高了生产积极性，推动了春耕准备工作。
    这个村的支部是怎样向社员进行政治思想教育的呢？
    一、通过“三找”“四算”教育，坚定社员办社信心。这个社转入集体生产以后，大部分社员都积极参加劳动，决心要把合作社办好。但是，由于在建社中思想发动工作做得不够充分，还有些社员有各种不同的思想疑虑。劳力弱的贫农和下中农社员，主要怕出工少，收入少，怕无钱买粮，发生缺口粮的困难。如贫农赵永喜（患肺病）家九口人，只有一个半劳动力，单干的时候种了13亩9分地，除去公粮，一年到头紧巴巴的。去年建大社的时候，他就怕收入少不敢报名，经过耐心教育，才报了名，一部分人强马壮的上中农入社后主要有三怕：一怕收入不会有自己单干多；二怕社里活多、活累；三怕零花钱不方便。如上中农常喜升说：“入社也不过就打我单干的时候那些粮食，不入还可能多打一些，入社不是讲自愿吗？以后看看不行我再出去。”又如上中农刘玉书家存有五、六百元，还说没有零花钱，不愿向合作社投资。合作社转入集体生产十多天，他一天工也没出。
    支部对这种情况反复地进行了分析研究，认为一部分社员入社思想不够坚定的原因，主要是对今年收入不摸底。因此，支部便协助管委会通过“三找”（找增产潜力、找增产门路、找增产经验）“四算”（算收入、算开支、算工数、算分配），概算了全年的收入。然后支部就把“四算”的结果让社员普遍展开了讨论，还在各个生产队选择了不同的典型户，分别地进行了试算。如富裕户杨喜生11口人，28亩地，1台车，两头牛和1头驴，单干的时候全年净收入16石，今年全家4个男劳动力和1个女劳动力，可做750个劳动日，可收入47石6斗，再加地租5石，牛租2石1斗，总收入可达54石7斗，比他单干的时候多收入38石7斗。原来总担心自己劳力弱，收入少的赵永喜，今年可做200个劳动日，收入12石6斗，加地租2石8斗，共可收入15石4斗，比单干的时候增加7石4斗粮，经过算账，绝大多数社员都能增加收入。他们高兴地说：再不犹豫了，一定好好干到底。
    二、加强集体主义思想教育，树立社员“以社为家”的思想。有些社员对个人利益和集体利益的一致性认识不足，他们的想法是：地入社了，自己不用操心了，等着干活得啦！有些已经作价归社和租用的东西，拿到社里就变了样。如李奎元一台车作价的时候前后刹绳都是新的，拿到社里他就换了二条破绳子。赵景春一台胶轮车入社的时候什么都齐全，转入集体生产的时候空车刚赶到社里滚珠套就压坏了。绳子也不够了，大鞭杆换个“腊”木棍子。有的不愿向社投资，不愿把草料卖给社里。如上中农方树相，明知社里谷草不足，却把1，000多斤谷草卖给供销社了。也有的不爱护公共财产，第五生产队一个架辕的牲畜膀子打破了谁都不管。第一生产队有三、四台车成天在外边风吹日晒也没人过问。针对这种情况，支部就组织了社干部和党团员向全体社员进一步进行了爱社教育，着重通过爱社教育说明个人利益和集体利益一致性的道理，并在社员中表扬了爱护公共财产的好社员，使社员懂得了要把社办好，就得靠大家努力，人人关心社，人人爱护社。经过教育，不少社员初步认识到自己和社的关系，树立了“以社为家”的思想。
    在编组编队推行包工制的时候，开始对老弱残疾的社员安排活计不够，社员和社员之间出现了“挑对劲的，找对手的，不要软弱劳动力”的现象。支部就向社干部说明了安排老弱劳力参加生产的重要性，在一般社员中主要进行“阶级友爱”和“团结生产”的教育；对老弱残疾社员主要进行勤劳生产，积少成多的教育，克服他们单纯依赖社内救济的错误思想。并根据当前生产的特点，找出了拣粪、截木头、喂牲畜、赶车送粪、筹集草料、盖牲畜棚等六项活计，让老弱残疾劳力去做。经过这样教育和安排之后，现在社里排斥老弱劳力参加生产的现象不见了。
    三、向社员进行劳动纪律的教育，不断地提高社员的生产积极性。这个社虽然也曾规定了劳动纪律，但是贯彻执行得很不好，违犯劳动纪律的现象时常发生。有的社员无故旷工，有的社员挑轻活躲重活。第一生产队常喜全嫌打柴太累，有六、七天不请假也不上工，第二生产队九个人上山打柴，每人平均一天才打20捆。针对这种情况，支部和社干部除了向社员说明“多劳多得，少劳少得”的道理外，并且进一步进行了劳动纪律的教育，还发动社干部和社员进行了一次思想大检查。各个生产队都分别表扬了一贯积极劳动的好社员，这样不仅鼓舞了先进的社员，对生产一贯消极落后的社员也是一种很好的教育。
    四、发挥党团员的模范带头作用。全村党员15名，团员37名。大社建成以后，支部根据党员团员分布情况，按全社7个生产队划分了4个党小组，5个团小组，教育党员团员在生产中发挥带头和示范作用。如动员社员打石头修拦河坝的时候，开始有些社员嫌活累、活脏，不愿干，党员唐凤武（转业军人）就带头去干。这时许多社员都说：人家唐凤武为了社不怕辛苦，咱们为什么不干呢！在他的带头影响下，第六生产队过去不会打石头的12名社员，现在也上山去打石头了。他们表示要向唐凤武学习，保证完成打石头任务。
    这个村的支部由于紧紧地结合生产加强了对社员的思想教育，发挥了党团员的模范带头作用，不仅大大地提高了社员的社会主义思想觉悟，坚定了社员办社信心，同时也有效地推动了备耕生产。全社在短短的半月时间里，已经打了烧柴15，400捆，砍木头58，000斤，拣粪19，200斤，攒硝灰3，950斤，副业收入了800多元，还套了6台车送粪，妇女和老弱劳力也积极地在筹集草料和种籽。全体社员满怀信心地要争取在3月20日前完成备耕生产，转入春耕播种。
