    Preselling Bus Tickets on Trains
    Based on the suggestion of the temporary management office of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, the Jiuquan branch of Gansu Provincial Transportation Company began to presell bus tickets for the west-bound route on trains heading to Zhangye from the beginning of this year, emulating the Soviet Alagin ticket sales method. This has greatly facilitated passengers' travel.
    After the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway opened to Zhangye, many people who went to Xinjiang to support construction disembarked here every day, waiting to buy west-bound bus tickets. Often, many people had to wait one or two days, or even three days, to buy bus tickets. The state had to spend an extra travel expense, and passengers could not get to their new posts in time to work. Seeing this situation, the railway workers felt that it was necessary to improve the situation and suggested that the Jiuquan Transportation Branch imitate the Alagin ticket sales method and presell bus tickets on the train. They accepted this suggestion and sent a ticket seller to sell tickets on the train. After passengers get off the train in Zhangye, they can directly transfer to the bus, saving the trouble of queuing to buy bus tickets.
    This method is very good and convenient for passengers. In some places where railways and highways intersect, it can be promoted according to needs and possibilities.

    在火车上预售汽车票
    甘肃省运输公司酒泉分公司根据铁道部第一工程局临时管理处的建议，从今年元旦开始，仿照苏联阿拉金售票法，在开往张掖的火车上，预先售卖西去的汽车票，大大便利了乘客的旅行。
    兰新铁路通车张掖后，每天都有很多前去新疆支援建设的人员在这里下车，等候着买西去的汽车票。常常有许多人为了买汽车票等候一、两天，甚至于还有等到三天的。国家要多花销一笔旅费，旅客也不能及时赶到新的岗位工作。铁路职工看到这个情况，觉得有必要加以改进，建议酒泉运输分公司仿照阿拉金售票法，在火车上预售汽车票。他们接受这个建议，派出一名售票员在列车上售票。旅客在张掖下火车后，可以直接改乘汽车，免去再去排队买汽车票的麻烦。
    这个办法很好，对旅客很便利。在一些铁路和公路相交接的地方，可以根据需要和可能加以推行。
