Report on Inspection of Work in Yunnan Province
Song Qingling

Due to my overseas visits to India, Burma, and Pakistan, I only conducted six days of inspection work in Yunnan Province and Kunming City this time. From November 28th to December 3rd, after listening to the work reports from the leading comrades of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee, I continuously inspected 10 locations, including 3 granaries, the Li Neng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangsuan Township, Jinning County, the Ala Township of minority nationalities, the Yunnan Cigarette Factory, the street work in Zhuji Street of Kunming City, bamboo ware and hardware handicraft cooperatives, the Provincial People's Committee's nursery, and the Huangtupo Military Region nursery, among other units. Although the time was relatively short, this inspection work left me with a deep impression.

Yunnan, a province with a population of over 17.3 million and excellent natural conditions, is a good place. However, due to inconvenient transportation and backward industrial technology, its economic and cultural development has been greatly hindered. For example, near Burma, sugar is only 11 cents per kilogram. In some places, grain is only 3 cents per kilogram, and pork is only 20 cents per kilogram, while in other places, grain is 11 cents per kilogram, and pork is 70 cents per kilogram. Furthermore, Yunnan's flue-cured tobacco is used as flavoring in cigarettes in Shanghai, but here, using all Yunnan flue-cured tobacco to make cigarettes still doesn't produce good cigarettes. In addition, sugar production in Yunnan is not yet industrialized, but is entirely handmade.

Currently, in addition to developing grain production, Yunnan can also greatly develop cash crops such as flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, cotton, coffee, hemp, bananas, and silkworms. Therefore, how to implement the plan to develop Yunnan's transportation, especially completing the Kunming railway plan, and vigorously improving technology and developing industries suitable for agriculture are important conditions for developing Yunnan's economy.

In terms of the development of the agricultural collectivization movement, although Yunnan Province has many ethnic groups, its achievements are exciting. In the spring of 1953, there were only 9 cooperatives in the province. However, in the autumn of 1954, after the organized and planned leadership of the Party and the government, 900 cooperatives were developed in just one month. At the time of my inspection, there were 35,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province, accounting for 29% of the total number of farm households in areas where land reform had been implemented. It was planned to develop to 75% by the autumn of 1956 and achieve semi-socialist collectivization throughout the province by the end of the year. It is now said that semi-socialist collectivization can be basically completed before this year's spring plowing.

When I inspected the Li Neng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shangsuan Township, when the members answered my question about what demands they had of the government, they unanimously and firmly said: We only have one demand, which is to establish advanced cooperatives. They said that Chairman Mao said in his report on the question of agricultural cooperation that 60% to 70% of farmers nationwide should take the road of collectivization, but after listening to Chairman Mao's report here, 80% of farmers already want to collectivize. In the Unity Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ala Township, I also felt the farmers' enthusiastic support for the collectivization movement. Therefore, the nationwide upsurge of the collectivization movement predicted by Chairman Mao has indeed arrived.

Yunnan Province is a multi-ethnic area. According to last year's statistics, of the province's more than 17.3 million people, 5.7 million are ethnic minorities, accounting for about one-third of the total population. According to ethnic identification, there are about 20 ethnic groups in the province, and each ethnic group has many branches. Currently, there is no single-ethnic county in Yunnan; even Kunming City has 9 ethnic groups. Of the province's more than 9,000 townships, single Han townships account for 20%, single minority ethnic townships account for 30%, and townships with two or more ethnic groups account for 50%. One township even has 8 ethnic groups. Therefore, the implementation of ethnic policies has become an important task in Yunnan Province. Currently, ethnic work in Yunnan is being done relatively well, and there are no major problems, but the work situation is complex and arduous. Therefore, I believe that the central government should provide more assistance to Yunnan, which is located on our country's border, in this work.

In the entire inspection work, I have a deeper impression, which is that health work in Yunnan Province still needs to be strengthened. Although Yunnan has made great achievements in health work, and health expenditure accounts for a large amount in each year's budget, it is still far from meeting the needs of the people's lives, especially health work among women. Because women have suffered from long-term oppression and excessive labor before liberation, gynecological diseases are quite common, whether in rural areas or in factories. In addition, there are more eye diseases in rural areas, environmental sanitation is not done well enough, and the hygiene habits of general cadres are also poor. Therefore, how to strengthen health work and vigorously carry out health publicity and education is a problem that needs to be well resolved.

In connection with the aforementioned issue of improving technology, in several units I inspected, such as the Yunnan Cigarette Factory and two nurseries, I heard reflections from employees requesting to learn technology and culture. I think these are good phenomena. However, due to insufficient local conditions, these problems have not been well resolved. For example, the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee's nursery has fairly good conditions in terms of housing and equipment. However, among the 56 nursery staff and 40 administrative staff in the entire institution, only two nursery workers have studied in Beijing, and everyone lacks experience in both care and education. Therefore, I feel that it is necessary for our central government to provide appropriate assistance.

Because what I inspected this time was only a small part of the work in Yunnan Province, and my observation was not comprehensive enough, my feelings and opinions may be one-sided and not mature enough. This report is only for comrades' reference for further study.

    视察云南省工作的报告
    宋庆龄
    我由于出国访问印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦，这一次在云南省和昆明市只作了6天的视察工作。自11月28日开始至12月3日止，我在听取了中共云南省委和省人民委员会领导同志们汇报工作以后，连续视察了10个地方，包括3个粮仓、晋宁县上蒜乡的李能农业生产合作社、少数民族的阿拉乡、云南纸烟厂、昆明市珠玑街的街道工作、竹器和五金等手工业合作社、省人民委员会的保育院，以及黄土坡军区保育院等单位。虽然时间比较短促，但是这次的视察工作却给我留下了深刻的印象。
    云南这个有着1，730多万人口的、具有优良自然条件的省份是个好地方。可是由于交通不便，工业技术落后，它在经济上和文化上的发展受到了很大的阻碍。例如靠近缅甸的地方，糖只有一角一斤。有些地方粮食只有三分一斤，猪肉只有两角一斤，但在另一些地方，粮食是一角一分一斤，猪肉是七角一斤。又如云南的烤烟，在上海是用作纸烟中的香料，而这里全部用云南烤烟作纸烟，还作不出好烟。此外，制糖在云南还不是工业，而是完全用手工制造的。
    目前，云南除了可以发展粮食的生产以外，还可以大大地发展经济作物，如烤烟、甘蔗、木棉、咖啡、麻、香蕉、蚕桑等。因此，如何贯彻执行发展云南交通的计划，特别是修通昆明的铁路计划，和大力提高技术、发展与农业相适应的工业是发展云南经济的重要条件。
    在农业合作化运动的发展上，云南省的民族虽然很多，但是它的成绩是令人兴奋的。1953年春天的时候，全省只有9个合作社。但是在1954年秋天，经过党和政府有组织有计划的领导，仅在一个月内就发展了900个合作社。在我视察的时候，全省共有35，000个农业生产合作社，占已经实行土地改革地区农户总数的29％。准备1956年秋天发展到75％，年底做到全省半社会主义合作化。现在据说在今年春耕以前可以基本上完成半社会主义合作化。
    当我视察上蒜乡李能农业生产合作社的时候，社员们在回答我问他们对政府有什么要求的时候，他们一致坚决地说：我们只有一个要求，就是要办高级社。他们说，毛主席在关于农业合作化问题的报告中说全国60％至70％的农民要走合作化的路，但是我们这里听了毛主席的报告以后，已经有80％的农民要合作化。在阿拉乡团结农业生产合作社中，我也同样地感受到农民们对合作化运动的热烈拥护。因此，毛主席所预言的全国性的合作化运动的高潮确实是已经到来了。
    云南省是个多民族的地区，按去年的统计，全省1，730多万人口中，有570万人是少数民族，约占总人口的三分之一。根据民族鉴定，全省约有20几个民族，而一个民族里又有许多支系。目前在云南没有一个县是单一民族的县，即昆明市也有9种民族。在全省9，000多个乡中，单一的汉族乡占20％，单一的少数民族乡占30％，两个民族以上的乡占50％，多的一乡内竟有8个民族。因此，民族政策的贯彻执行也就成为云南省的一项重要工作。目前云南的民族工作做得是较好的，还没有什么大的问题，但是工作情况是复杂的艰巨的。为此，我觉得中央对于处在我国边疆的云南，在这项工作上应当予以更多的帮助。
    在整个视察工作中，我有一个较深的印象，就是感到云南省的卫生工作还需要加强。虽然云南在卫生工作上已经有很大的成绩，而且卫生经费的支出在每年的预算中也占很大的数目，但是还远赶不上人民生活的需要，特别是妇女中的卫生工作。由于妇女们在解放前受到长期压迫和过度劳动的损害，不论在农村中或是在工厂里，妇女病相当多。此外，农村中的眼病也较多，环境卫生还做得不够好，一般干部的卫生习惯也较差。因此，如何加强卫生工作和大力开展卫生宣传教育工作，是需要很好解决的一个问题。
    联系到前面所谈的提高技术的问题，在好几个我所视察的单位中，例如云南纸烟厂和两个保育院等，我都听到职工同志们要求学习技术，学习文化的反映。我认为这些都是好现象。但是由于当地条件不够，这些问题还未很好得到解决。比如云南省人民委员会的保育院，房屋设备方面的条件可以说是相当好。但是在全院56个保育人员和40个行政人员当中，只有两个保育员曾到北京学习过，大家在保和教的两方面都很缺乏经验。所以，我觉得我们中央予以适当的帮助是很必要的。
    由于我这次所视察的只是云南省的一小部分工作，观察也不够全面，因此我的感想和意见可能是片面的，不够成熟的，这个报告只供同志们进一步研究的参考。
