Xinhua News Agency Report: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held an award ceremony on January 28th, awarding bonuses of 8,000 yuan each to Wei Dawei, Liang Feng, and Zhai Xiaowu, who defected from Taiwan by plane. About 600 people attended the ceremony, including officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, staff members of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, representatives from all walks of life in Beijing, and Chinese and foreign journalists. Hu Hongyi, Liu Ruolong, and others who had previously defected also attended. Wei Dawei's sister, who works in Tianjin, made a special trip to Beijing to attend the conference. The people present congratulated them on their reunion.

The conference was presided over by Major General Zhang Zizhen, a representative of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. When he presented the bonuses to Wei Dawei and the other two, warm applause broke out in the hall. Zhang Zizhen said that most of the officers and soldiers of the Chiang army were deceived and forced to join the Chiang bandit army. As long as they lay down their weapons, they can receive lenient treatment from the people, and according to their wishes, they will be sent home to reunite with their families and assigned appropriate work. Defecting and performing meritorious service can be rewarded even more. Zhang Zizhen said that all Chiang army officers and soldiers should recognize that only by laying down their weapons or defecting and performing meritorious service can they have a bright future.

Zhang Yougu, a member of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who previously served as the Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang Nanjing Air Force Headquarters and the Commander of the Kuomintang Chengdu Air Force Third Route Command, called on his air force friends in Taiwan at the meeting to return as soon as possible, escape from the sea of ​​suffering, and return to the prosperous and happy motherland.

The people present welcomed Senior Colonel Liu Shanben, the Air Force Division Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with warm applause. He defected from Xinjin Airport in Sichuan to Yan'an by plane in 1946.

When Liu Shanben announced at the meeting that at the same time as Wei Dawei and others began holding a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing on the morning of the 27th, four more Chiang bandit planes were shot down and damaged by our army over Fujian, the hall immediately burst into thunderous applause. Liu Shanben said that the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery units will definitely annihilate and strike any Chiang bandit air force that dares to intrude into the mainland of the motherland; and the Chiang army air force who defect and return by plane will definitely be protected and warmly welcomed and rewarded at any time and anywhere. Liu Shanben called on the Chiang army air force personnel in Taiwan to take the bright road and defect to return as soon as possible.

Guan Shixiong, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Democratic Youth Federation, pointed out at the meeting that taking the path of Wei Dawei is the only correct path for the Chiang army air force youth and aviation personnel in Taiwan.

Ha Qingci, a teacher at Beijing No. 11 Girls' Middle School, said at the meeting that every time she saw news reports about the Chiang army air force defecting, she hoped that her relatives would return. She hopes that her brothers Ha Huwen and Ha Yuwen and her brother-in-law Wang Jianzhen, who are serving as Chiang bandit air force officers in Taiwan, can hear the joyful voices of welcoming Wei Dawei and others tonight, and know what to choose, and not continue to sink.

Wei Dawei delivered a speech on behalf of the three of them who had defected, expressing his infinite gratitude to the people of the motherland for their welcome and rewards, and recounted the process of their defection, condemning the heinous crimes of American imperialism's invasion of Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Wei Dawei finally said that the three of us returned to the mainland of the motherland after being separated for seven years, and we never expected it to have become so beautiful. We all yearn to take up our posts as soon as possible and dedicate ourselves to the socialist construction of the great motherland.

    解放军总政治部举行授奖大会
    授给起义人员韦大卫等三人奖金
    新华社讯　中国人民解放军总政治部在1月28日举行了授奖大会，授给从台湾驾飞机起义归来的韦大卫、梁枫、翟笑梧三人每人奖金8，000元。出席大会的有中国人民解放军官兵、中国民用航空局工作人员、北京市各界代表和中外记者共约600人。以前起义归来的胡弘一、刘若龙等也到了会。在天津工作的韦大卫的妹妹特地赶到北京参加大会，到会的人们纷纷祝贺他们兄妹重逢。
    大会由中国人民解放军总政治部代表张梓桢少将主持。当他把奖金发给韦大卫等三人的时候，会场上响起了热烈的掌声。张梓桢说，蒋军官兵大多数是受骗被迫参加蒋贼军的，他们只要放下武器，就可以得到人民的宽大待遇，并且根据他们的意愿，送他们回家和家人团聚和分配给他们适当的工作。起义立功更可以受奖。张梓桢说，所有蒋军官兵都应当认识，只有放下武器或起义立功，才有他们的光明前途。
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会委员张有谷，以前曾任国民党南京空军总指挥部参谋长、国民党成都空军第三路司令部司令等职务。他在会上号召在台湾的空军朋友们及早回来，脱离苦海，回到富强康乐的祖国大陆来。
    到会的人们以热烈的掌声欢迎中国人民解放军空军师长刘善本大校讲话，他是在1946年从四川新津机场驾机起义飞到延安的。
    当刘善本在会上宣告，与韦大卫等27日上午在北京开始举行中外记者招待会的同一时间，又有四架蒋贼飞机在福建上空被我军击落击伤，会场立刻震响了暴风雨般的掌声。刘善本说，强大的中国人民解放军空军和高射炮部队，对于胆敢窜犯祖国大陆的蒋贼空军，一定予以歼灭打击；而对于驾机起义归来的蒋军空军，在任何时候、任何地方，都一定会受到保护，受到热烈的欢迎和奖励。刘善本号召在台湾的蒋军空军人员早日走光明道路，起义归来。
    北京市民主青年联合会副主席关世雄在会上指出，走韦大卫的道路，是在台湾的蒋军空军青年和航空人员唯一正确的道路。
    北京市第十一女子中学教员哈庆慈在会上说，当她每次看到报上发表蒋军空军起义归来的消息，就希望回来的是她的亲属。她希望在台湾充当蒋贼空军军官的哥哥哈虎文、哈郁文和姐夫王健珍，都能听到今天晚上欢迎韦大卫等的欢乐声音，而知有所选择，不要再沉沦下去。
    韦大卫代表他们起义归来的三个人致词，他对祖国人民给予他们的欢迎和奖励表示无限的感激，并且叙述了他们起义归来的经过，控诉了美帝国主义侵略台湾和蒋介石卖国集团的万恶罪行。韦大卫最后说，我们三个人回到分别七年的祖国大陆，最初都没有想到它已变得这么美好，我们都渴望着早日走上工作岗位，献身於伟大祖国的社会主义建设。
