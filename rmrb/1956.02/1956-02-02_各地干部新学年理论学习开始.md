Xinhua News Agency, February 1st: From the fourth quarter of last year to January of this year, a large number of working cadres in government organs across the country successively began their new semester of theoretical study.

In this academic year, the number of participants in study has generally increased in various regions. In Liaoning Province, the number of participants reached more than 207,000, accounting for more than 60% of cadres in government organs, factories, and enterprises across the province. In Hubei Province, more than 160,000 cadres participated in the study, and in Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, Hunan, and other provinces, the number of participants all reached over 100,000. The participating cadres have been divided into advanced, intermediate, and elementary groups, and have begun to study courses such as "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism," "Political Economy," "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," and "History of the Communist Party of China." Students in the elementary groups in Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Heilongjiang, and other provinces also studied "Modern History of the Chinese Revolution," "Reader of Basic Knowledge of Economic Construction," "History of Social Development," and documents related to the First Five-Year Plan, agricultural collectivization, and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Government cadres mainly adopt the form of amateur self-study or participate in amateur political theory schools for study. In Shandong Province, some students in the advanced group focus on self-study. Beijing has already opened 32 amateur political theory schools. Guangxi Province has established 10 amateur political theory schools. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires the Party committees of provincial-level organs and the local and municipal Party committees to run a good amateur intermediate political theory school this year. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also plans to establish 26 amateur intermediate political theory schools and more than 200 amateur elementary political theory schools throughout the province this year. Party committees in various regions have cultivated and allocated full-time or part-time teachers for cadre theoretical education. Beijing, Shaanxi, and other provinces and cities have also established lecture groups to give lectures to cadres.

Currently, Party committees in various regions have formulated plans for cadre theoretical study and have stipulated the progress of each course and some necessary study systems.
