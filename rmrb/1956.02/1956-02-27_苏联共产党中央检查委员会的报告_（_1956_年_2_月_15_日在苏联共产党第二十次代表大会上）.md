    Report of the Central Auditing Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    (Delivered at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on February 15, 1956)
    Moskaltov
    I.
    Comrades! In the summary report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade N.S. Khrushchev made a profound analysis of the international environment and domestic life of our country, and comprehensively summarized the world-historical victories achieved by our party in the period before the 20th Congress.
    Guaranteeing these achievements is the heroic labor of the Soviet people and the tremendous organizational activities of our party.
    In accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, the Central Auditing Commission systematically inspected the Party's finances during the period covered by the report, and inspected the work of the various organs of the CPSU Central Committee and their handling of letters, statements and complaints. During this period, the quality of the financial budget work of the organs of the CPSU Central Committee and the party organs of the states, regions, and republics has been significantly improved. Budget discipline has been strengthened, and the collection of party membership dues by party organs has also been improved.
    In the period between the 19th and 20th National Congresses of the Party, some changes have taken place in the structure of the revenue part of the budget. In the revenue part of the 1952 budget, the proportion of party membership dues accounted for 85%, the income from publishing accounted for 12%, and other income accounted for 3%; while in the 1955 budget revenue, party membership dues accounted for 73%, and the income from publishing increased to 26.3%. Other income accounted for 0.7%.
    The reason for the decrease in income from party membership dues is that, in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution adopted by the 19th National Congress, the amount of monthly party membership dues paid by party members and alternate members has been greatly reduced. Therefore, the task of the party organization is to increase the revenue part of the budget by further improving the collection of party membership dues, by expanding the publishing business of party organs, and by reducing administrative expenses.
    The increase in income from publishing in the budget is due to the fact that the number of newspapers issued by the "Pravda" Publishing House has increased by half since the 19th National Congress of the Party, and the number of magazines has more than doubled during this period. In addition, according to the decision of the CPSU Central Committee, the "Pravda" Publishing House began publishing the "Party Life" magazine from 1954, with a circulation of 500,000 copies; in 1955, it also published the "Youth Generation" magazine, with a circulation of 150,000 copies. During this period, the number of newspapers in states, regions, and republics also increased significantly.
    During the period covered by the report, the income from the publishing business of party organs could have been even greater if the newspapers of all states had not been losing money. Taking the 102 types of state newspapers in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic as an example, 43 of them obtained subsidies from the central government to make up for their expenses. The Central Auditing Commission believes that it is necessary to urge the relevant party leading organs to pay attention to this matter.
    During the period covered by the report, the Central Auditing Commission affirmed that the party leading organs in various places regularly checked the payment of party membership dues and took necessary measures to eliminate the shortcomings existing in this work. The Auditing Commission provided a lot of help to the party organs. In addition to checking the financial situation, they also checked the payment of party membership dues in the primary party organizations.
    However, there are still many party organizations that do not pay attention to the correct arrangement of the work of collecting party membership dues and do not give enough attention to this part of the work.
    Some party organizations did not explain the instructions of the CPSU Central Committee on the payment of party membership dues to the communists. Therefore, this situation occurred: communists did not pay party membership dues in time, or paid less than the amount stipulated in the Party Constitution. Such facts are pointed out in the summary reports of the auditing committees of party organizations in Bryansk Oblast, Kalinin Oblast, Chkalov Oblast, Chuvash Oblast, and many other states.
    The failure of communists to pay party membership dues in time often leads to these party members being separated from the party, and even expelled from the party. For example, the Yaroslavl Oblast Auditing Commission pointed out in its summary report at the oblast party congress that in 1954 and the first 9 months of 1955, one-fifth of all expelled party members were expelled for frequently failing to pay party membership dues. This situation should be considered very abnormal and should attract the attention of our party organizations at all levels.
    Not all primary party organizations abide by the regulations on regularly remitting the party membership dues paid by party members and alternate members to the savings bureau. Many secretaries of primary party organizations do not remit the party membership dues to the savings bureau in accordance with the instructions of the CPSU Central Committee: remit them as they are received, at least once every ten days, and rural primary party organizations at least once a month, but delay the remittance of the collected party membership dues to the savings bureau for a long time. For example, in the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, individual secretaries of primary party organizations did not remit party membership dues to the savings bureau for as long as thirteen months. The summary reports of the auditing committees of the party organizations in Kaliningrad, Primorsky Krai, Pskov, Udmurt, and other states also raised the fact that the secretaries of primary party organizations did not remit party membership dues in time.
    Failure to comply with the system of remitting party membership dues to the savings bureau on schedule has had a bad impact on the revenue part of the party budget and has to some extent hindered the work of allocating funds to local party organs in accordance with the budget regulations. Sometimes this practice also causes the phenomenon of embezzling party membership dues.
    As the auditing committees in various places pointed out in their reports, embezzlement of party membership dues has occurred in some primary party organizations in Gorky Oblast, Omsk Oblast, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Smolensk Oblast, and other states. Party organizations at all levels must pay special attention to this and eliminate this phenomenon as soon as possible, and never allow this phenomenon to occur in the work of our primary party organizations in the future.
    Now let's talk about the expenditure part of the budget. I think it is necessary to report to the Congress that the funds allocated by the CPSU Central Committee to the party organs are generally used for legitimate purposes and are spent in accordance with the amounts stipulated in the budget. It should be pointed out that 94% of all appropriations in the 1956 party budget are used by local party organs, which is more than 3% more than what the Central Auditing Commission said in the summary report of the 19th Party Congress.
    During the period covered by the report, the finances of the central organs of the Soviet Union were greatly improved, and its expenditures were reduced. During the period from the 19th National Congress to the 20th National Congress, the staff of the organs of the CPSU Central Committee was reduced by 24.7%.
    In the total number of staff members of party organs, the vast majority work in the party municipal committees, district committees, and primary party organizations. If the personnel of all local party organs is 100%, the total number of personnel of the state committees, regional committees, and the Communist Party Central Committee of the union republics only accounts for 12.2%, while the personnel of the party municipal committees, urban and rural district committees, and the staff of primary party organizations account for 87.8%.
    As everyone knows, the main part of the party's budget is used for party propaganda work, for training party and Soviet leading cadres, and for building houses used by party organs. A large part of the funds stipulated for party propaganda work is used as the funds for the party libraries of the party municipal committees and district committees. If the total amount used for party propaganda work is 100%, then 58% is allocated to party libraries, and 23% is allocated to short-term training classes and study classes. Through the short-term training classes and study classes established by the state committees, regional committees, and the Communist Party Central Committee of the union republics, 50,000 propaganda workers can be trained every year.
    Marxist-Leninist night universities occupy a significant position in the party's education system. The night university network is constantly increasing. There are now 149,000 people studying in 288 Marxist-Leninist night universities, including 80,000 members of the CPSU, 33,000 members of the Communist Youth League, and 36,000 non-party members.
    The training of party and Soviet staff is carried out through three-year party schools in the republics, regions, and states, through one-year training classes of state committees, regional committees, and the Communist Party Central Committee of the union republics, and through the Advanced Party School and the Academy of Social Sciences of the CPSU Central Committee. During the period from the 19th Party Congress to the 20th Party Congress, more than 34,000 people were trained through the above-mentioned schools.
    As mentioned above, the appropriations of the CPSU Central Committee are used by local party organs for direct purposes. However, some party organizations often overspend on individual budget items, especially in terms of administrative expenses. During the period covered by the report, the Vladimir, Moldovan, and other party organizations caused such overspending, which should be considered a serious violation of financial budget discipline.
    The Party Central Committee has given great assistance to local party organizations in improving their working conditions. During the reporting period, a total of 756 new houses were built for party district committees, municipal committees, state committees, party schools, libraries, and residences, with a total expenditure of approximately 700 million rubles. Most of the state committees, regional committees, and the Communist Party Central Committee of the union republics completed the above-mentioned construction well in a short period of time in accordance with the approved budget.
    At the same time, it must be pointed out that many party organizations have many serious shortcomings and waste in design and construction work, and add unnecessary decorations to the houses, which greatly increases the cost of construction. Some party state committees have violated the stipulated time limit for building houses for local party organizations. Many such facts can be cited: the construction of houses for some district committees (especially in rural areas) has been going on for three years or more. For example, the party state committee of Kostroma Oblast has been building houses for the party district committees in Susanin, Bawinsbalkin, Pishug, etc. for the fourth year now, and has also greatly exceeded the budget expenditure. The construction work of the state committees of Astrakhan and Dagestan is also progressing very slowly. The Astrakhan state committee only used 69% of the construction appropriations in 1954, and only 57% in 1955. The Dagestan state committee only used 49% of the appropriations stipulated by the central government for the above-mentioned purposes in 1954, and only 38.3% in 1955.
    The party state committees, regional committees, and the Communist Party Central Committee of the union republics must give due attention to the shortcomings in the construction of houses for local party organs and take measures to eliminate these shortcomings.
    Secondly, I would like to talk about the supervision and inspection of the finances of party organs in various places. On this issue, it must be reported to the Congress that, in addition to the financial inspections conducted by the auditing committees and the state committees, regional committees, and the Communist Party Central Committee of the union republics in various places, the General Office of the CPSU Central Committee inspected the financial budgets and economic work and the payment of party membership dues of 111 party state committees, regional committees, and the Communist Party Central Committee of the union republics, 416 party municipal committees and district committees, and 907 primary party organizations in 1953, 1954, and 1955. At the same time, financial inspections were conducted in party schools and newspaper publishing organs in the states, regions, and republics.
    This is a brief analysis of the financial budget work of party organs during the period covered by the summary report. The task in the future is not to relax attention to the financial work of each party organ. It is necessary to eliminate the shortcomings that still exist in the collection of party membership dues, to pay party membership dues in a timely and correct manner, to improve the publishing work of each party organ, to save expenses, and to reduce unnecessary expenses. The auditing committee should continue to regularly check the financial work of each party organ in the future, and pay attention to the suggestions made to each party organ based on the results of the inspection.
    II.
    Comrades! During the reporting period, the Central Auditing Commission inspected the handling of letters and complaints from workers by various departments of the CPSU Central Committee. The inspection showed that the central departments have strengthened their attention to this part of the work and have more effectively handled the issues mentioned in the letters and complaints. Many letters pointed out the shortcomings in the work of certain organizations and enterprises, which has played a good role in improving the work of these organizations.
    The summary reports made by the auditing committees of the states, regions, and republics at the party congresses of the states and regions and the party congresses of the union republics have pointed out that the local party organizations have also greatly improved the work of handling letters, statements, and complaints from workers. The processing time has been shortened, and the registration and supervision of the handling situation have also been streamlined. The state committees, regional committees, and the Communist Party Central Committees of the union republics have begun to discuss issues related to the work of letters and complaints more often at secretariat meetings and standing committee meetings. However, by no means all organizations have given due attention to the work of handling letters, statements, and complaints from workers. Analyzing the letters, statements, and complaints received by the CPSU Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission, it can be seen that a large part of the issues involved can be handled by the relevant organizations and competent authorities in a timely manner. However, because individual staff members in these organizations and competent authorities often handle these letters, statements, and complaints very carelessly, do not reply in a timely manner, and cannot often solve the problems correctly, people have to appeal to higher-level organs, up to the CPSU Central Committee.
    Of all the letters, statements, and complaints received by the CPSU Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission in 1954 and 1955, 25% of the letters and complaints were about labor issues, that is, issues related to material assistance, medical treatment, and sanatoriums, issues related to social insurance, inventions, and rationalization proposals, that is, issues that should have been resolved by trade union organizations, economic organizations, and Soviet organizations in a timely and smooth manner. Another situation that can prove this is that in 1954 and 1955, government departments and competent authorities and many other organizations sent 145,000 replies to letters and complaints to the central government, asking the Party Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission for instructions. Among them, 94,000, or 65%, were approved.
    It can be seen that if the organizations that initially received the letters and complaints could pay more attention to and handle them in a more timely manner, and resolve them correctly, then it would no longer be necessary to spend a long time doing supplementary processing, and workers would not need to go to higher-level organizations on these issues.
    At the recently held state and regional party congresses and the party congresses of the union republics, many auditing committees cited many examples in their summary reports to illustrate that some party and Soviet organizations treat the work of handling letters and complaints from workers with a formalistic attitude. What is said here is first of all the party organizations of Ivanovo, Penza, Tambov, and some other party organizations.
    Workers said in letters, statements, and complaints sent to the CPSU Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission that the work of receiving visitors in many government departments and competent authorities is still very poorly done. The staff members who receive visitors often cannot independently solve the problems raised by the workers to him. If the appellant wants to see a leading worker, it takes a lot of time. In addition, the reception hours stipulated by many organs are the working hours of workers and staff, so they cannot come to solve the problems they are concerned about.
    For example, to see the director of the Complaints Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Transport, you need a special permit. In this department, you cannot go to the political department and the worker cadre office without a special permit, but there are many railway transport workers who go there every day. This situation of receiving visitors has existed in the Ministry of Transport until recently.
    It is obvious that now is the time to resolutely eliminate this incorrect practice, which is obviously a violation of our party's repeated instructions in this regard. Our task is to eliminate the existing shortcomings in the work of handling letters, statements, and complaints, and to implement a strict system of receiving visitors in all party organizations, Soviet organizations, economic organizations, and other organizations.
    In this regard, it is necessary to reiterate V.I. Lenin's instructions on how to treat letters, statements, and complaints from workers. V.I. Lenin pointed out more than once that the complaints made by workers about the shortcomings of the work of the Soviet organs are in essence supervision from below. He demanded that all Soviet organs care about satisfying the urgent needs of the workers, pay attention to the warnings they raised, quickly reflect them, and implement all of this in all their activities. V.I. Lenin often called on the party not to tolerate bureaucratic working methods, and often criticized individual leaders for being ignorant, arrogant, and putting on the airs of party members. He pointed out that bureaucratic, formalistic, and transactional leadership methods are incompatible with the essence of the Soviet regime, and it is necessary to constantly oppose procrastination, inertia, irresponsibility, and the phenomenon of not paying attention to the demands of workers.
    Comrades! In addition to receiving many letters and complaints from workers that justly pointed out the shortcomings in the work of individual party organizations, Soviet organizations, economic organizations, and other organizations or raised some issues that needed to be resolved immediately, the CPSU Central Committee, the Central Auditing Commission, and local party organs also received some letters, including anonymous letters, in which the writers, in order to achieve personal goals, attempted to slander staff members who had not committed any wrongdoing, fabricating all kinds of unwarranted charges, forcing many party and Soviet organization staff members to investigate these slanderous lies.
    We believe that it is not necessary to process all these letters. The attention of the party and other organizations should be focused on the letters, statements, and complaints of such citizens who justly criticize the shortcomings of any of our organizations and are willing to actively help the party and the state to eradicate certain shortcomings in the work of party organizations, Soviet organizations, economic organizations, and other organizations. (Applause)
    Unfortunately, there are still some communists here who complain to the Party Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission that the local party organs and Soviet organs do not arrange work for them. The results of the investigation showed that many of these party members were removed from leadership and responsible work because they were incompetent and had a bad reputation, but they still insisted on taking on their previous work and resolutely refused other work. Such people, who have been out of work for a long time due to their own faults, want to enjoy privileges and are waiting to be called to take on work that is no less in nature and size than the work they were removed from. Attention must be paid to such communists, and their incorrect behavior should be individually examined in the party organizations to which they belong.
    III.
    Comrades! The Central Auditing Commission inspected the handling of affairs by the Party Disciplinary Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and found that during the period after the 19th Party Congress, the Party Disciplinary Commission had handled more than 44,000 appeals and applications from party members and alternate members.
    However, it must be reported to the 20th Party Congress that after the 19th Party Congress of the Party, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union exposed the shortcomings in the organs of the Party Disciplinary Commission, that is, in many cases, the personal cases of party members were only processed through letters, or only by individuals rather than by the entire Party Disciplinary Commission.
    For two years, the Party Disciplinary Commission has greatly improved the work of reviewing applications and personal cases submitted to the commission, and corrected the mistakes made in the past.
    During the period covered by the report, our party carried out a huge task of replacing the party membership cards of party members and alternate members. The replacement of party membership cards was to make the party membership cards conform to the party name adopted by the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Another purpose of replacing party membership cards is to rectify the work of registering party members.
    During the preparation and implementation of the replacement of party membership cards, the state committees, regional committees, and the Communist Party Central Committees of the union republics inspected the state of party affairs, which enabled our party to carry out the work of replacing party membership cards in an organized manner everywhere, and to make this work conform to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. At the same time, it must be pointed out that the due order of party affairs has not been rectified in all party organizations. Some party organizations did not make the necessary demands on party members, and did not cultivate their love for party membership cards and alternate party membership cards. Therefore, many incidents of losing party membership cards and alternate party membership cards have occurred. For example, during the period from 1954 to 1955, party members lost about 30,000 party membership cards. Individual district committees and municipal committees did not draw the due conclusions based on the fact that party members lost their party membership cards, nor did they take measures to investigate them.
    The task of the party organization is to continue to strengthen attention to party affairs issues in the future, strictly abide by the party member registration system stipulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the system of issuing and preserving party membership cards, and regularly explain to party members and alternate members that they are responsible to the party, and to hold them accountable for cherishing party membership cards and alternate party membership cards.
    Comrades! When our party convenes the 20th National Congress, it has achieved new and outstanding achievements in fulfilling the historical tasks of our motherland's economic development and international relations.
    When our party convenes the 20th National Congress, it has become more united, and has been ideologically strengthened in the spirit of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. There is no doubt that the entire party, the working class, the collective farmers, and the intellectuals of the people will be able to actively and militantly implement the resolutions of the 20th National Congress of the Party in order to further prosper our great motherland and ensure lasting peace among the people of all countries (stormy applause).

    苏联共产党中央检查委员会的报告
    （1956年2月15日在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上）
    莫斯卡托夫
    一、
    同志们！在苏联共产党中央委员会的总结报告中，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志对我国的国际环境和国内生活作了深刻的分析，详尽地总结了我们党在第二十次代表大会召开前的时期中所取得的世界性和历史性的胜利。
    保证取得这些成就的，是苏联人民的英勇劳动和我们党的巨大的组织活动。
    中央检查委员会按照党章的规定，在报告所涉及的时期内有步骤地检查了党的财务，检查了苏共中央各机关的工作和它们处理来信、声明和申诉的情况。在这个时期中，苏共中央各机关以及州、边区和各共和国的党机关的财务预算工作的质量有了显著的提高。预算纪律加强了，党机关征收党费的工作也有了改进。
    在党的第十九次和第二十次代表大会之间的时期中，预算的收入部分的结构发生了一些变化。在1952年的预算的收入部分中，党费的比重占85％，出版事业的收入占12％，其他收入占3％；而在1955年的预算收入中，党费占73％，出版事业的收入则增加到26.3％。其他收入占0.7％。
    党费收入减少的原因是：按照第十九次代表大会所通过的党章的规定，党员和候补党员每月缴纳的党费的数额大大减少了。因此，党组织的任务就是：通过进一步改进征收党费的工作、通过扩展党机关的出版事业、以及通过缩减行政管理开支来增加预算的收入部分。
    预算中出版事业的收入增加是由于：“真理报”出版社发行的报纸份数，从党的第十九次代表大会以来增加了一半，杂志份数在这个时期增加了一倍多。此外，根据苏共中央的决定，“真理报”出版社从1954年起开始出版“党的生活”杂志，其发行份数为50万册；1955年又出版了“青年时代”杂志，其发行份数为15万册。在这个时期，州、边区和共和国的报纸的份数也大大增加了。
    在报告所涉及的时期内，如果所有州的报纸都不亏损，则党机关出版事业的收入还能更多些。单拿俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国的102种州的报纸来说，其中就有43种报纸从中央取得补助金来弥补自己的开支。中央检查委员认为有必要促使有关的党的领导机关注意这件事情。
    在报告所涉及的时期中，中央检查委员会肯定：各地党的领导机关经常检查了缴纳党费的情况，并且采取了必要措施来消除这项工作中存在的缺点。检查委员会对党机关给了不少帮助，它们除了检查了财政状况以外，还检查了基层党组织中缴纳党费的情况。
    但是还有不少的党组织，它们不重视正确的安排征收党费的工作，对这部分工作没有给以足够的注意。
    某些党组织没有向共产党员解释苏共中央关于缴纳党费的指示，因此发生这种情形：共产党员没有及时缴纳党费，或者缴纳的数目少于党章所规定的数目。在布利安斯克州、加里宁州、契卡洛夫州、楚瓦什州和许多其他州的党组织的检查委员会的总结报告中都指出了这样的事实。
    共产党员不及时缴纳党费，往往使这些党员脱离了党，甚至因此把他们开除出党。例如，雅罗斯拉夫尔州检查委员会在州的党代表会议上所做的总结报告中就指出，在1954年中和1955年的9个月中，在全部开除出党的党员中，有五分之一是由于经常不缴纳党费而被开除的。这种情况应该认为是十分不正常的，应该引起我们各级党组织的注意。
    并不是一切基层党组织都遵守把党员和候补党员所缴纳的党费定期汇交储金局的规定。许多基层党组织的书记不按照苏共中央的指示把党费按下列规定汇交储金局：随收随交，至少每十天一次，农村基层党组织至少每月一次，而把收来的党费拖得很迟才交储金局。例如在鞑靼苏维埃社会主义自治共和国，个别的基层党组织书记不向储金局汇交党费竟达十三个月之久。在加里宁格勒、滨海区、普斯科夫、乌德摩尔特和其他党组织的检查委员会的总结报告中也都提出了基层党组织书记不及时汇交党费的事实。
    不遵守按期向储金局汇交党费的制度，对党预算的收入部分起了不好的影响，并且在某种程度上妨碍了按预算规定拨款给地方党机关的工作。有时这种做法还造成盗用党费的现象。
    像各地检查委员会在自己报告中指出的，在高尔基州、鄂木斯克州、斯维尔德洛夫斯克州、斯摩棱斯克州和其他州的一些基层党组织中都曾发生过盗用党费的事情。各级党组织必须对此特别加以注意，并且尽快地消灭这种现象，今后决不容许在我们基层党组织的工作中发生这种现象。
    现在来讲预算的支出部分。我认为必须向代表大会报告，苏共中央拨给各党机关的经费，一般用途是正当的，并且是按预算规定的数额支出的。应该指出，按1956年党预算的全部拨款中有94％供给地方党机关使用，这个数字比中央检查委员会在第十九次党代表大会的总结报告中所讲的大3％多。
    在报告所涉及的时期内，苏联中央机关的财务大大改善了，它的经费开支减少了。在第十九次代表大会到第二十次代表大会这段时期内，苏共中央的机关人员缩减了24.7％。
    在党机关工作人员的总数中，绝大多数是在党的市委员会、区委员会和基层党组织中工作。如果以所有地方党机关的人员为100％，则州委员会、边区委员会和加盟共和国共产党中央的人员总共只占12.2％，而党的市委员会、城乡区委员会的人员和基层党组织的工作人员则占87.8％。
    大家知道，党的预算的主要部分是用于党的宣传鼓动工作，用于培养和训练党的领导干部和苏维埃的领导干部、用于修建党机关所使用的房屋。规定用于党的宣传工作的一大部分经费，是用来作为党的市委员会和区委员会的党图书馆的经费。如果以用于党的宣传工作的全部款项为100％，则拨作党的图书馆的费用为58％，拨给短期训练班和研究班的经费为23％。通过州委员会、边区委员会和加盟共和国共产党中央设立的短期训练班和研究班，每年可培养出五万个宣传工作人员。
    马克思列宁主义夜大学在党的教育系统中占有显著的地位。夜大学网不断增加着。现在在288所马克思列宁主义夜大学里学习的共有149，000人，其中有苏共党员8万人，共青团员33，000人，非党员36，000人。
    党和苏维埃的工作人员的培养和训练是通过各共和国、边区和州的三年制党校，通过各州委员会、边区委员会和各加盟共和国共产党中央的一年制训练班，通过苏共中央的高级党校和社会科学院。在第十九次党代表大会到第二十次党代表大会的期间，通过上述学校培养和训练了34，000多人。
    上面说过，苏共中央的拨款，地方党机关都用于直接的用途。但也有些党的组织在个别预算项目上经常超支，特别是在行政经费方面上。在报告所涉及的时期内，造成这种超支的有弗拉基米尔的、摩尔多夫的以及其他的党组织，应当认为这是严重地违反了财政预算纪律。
    在改善地方党组织的工作条件方面，党中央给了它们很大的帮助。在报告期内为党的区委员会、市委员会、州委员会、党校、图书馆、住宅等共建造了756所新房子，开支总数共约7亿卢布。大多数的州委员会、边区委员会和各加盟共和国共产党中央都在短期内按照批准的预算很好地完成了上述的建设。
    同时必须指出，许多党组织在设计和建筑工作中存在着许多严重缺点和浪费，在房屋内添设不必要的装饰，因而大大增加了建筑的造价。有些党的州委员会破坏了给地方党组织建筑房屋规定的期限。可以举出很多这样的事实：有些区委员会（特别是在农村地区）的房屋建筑进行了三年或更多的时间。例如，科斯特罗马州的党的州委员会给苏萨宁、巴温斯巴尔金、皮休格等地党的区委会建造房屋，现在已经是第四年了，同时还大大超过了预算的开支。阿斯特拉汗和达格斯坦的党的州委员会的建筑工作也进行得很慢。阿斯特拉汗的州委会在1954年只用了建筑拨款的69％，而在1955年，只用了57％。达格斯坦州委员会在1954年只用了中央规定用于上述目的的拨款49％，而在1955年，总共只用了38.3％。
    党的各州委员会、各边区委员会和各加盟共和国的共产党中央必须对各地方党机关房屋建筑工作中的缺点给以应有的注意，并且采取措施来消除这些缺点。
    其次，我想谈一下对各地党机关财务的监督检查工作。在这个问题上，必须向代表大会报告，除了检查委员会和各州委员会、各边区委员会和各加盟共和国共产党中央在各地进行了财务检查以外，苏共中央事务管理处在1953、1954、1955年内对111个党的州委员会、边区委员会和加盟共和国共产党中央，对416个党的市委员会和区委员会，以及907个党的基层组织的财务预算和经济工作和党费缴纳工作情况进行了检查。同时在州、边区和共和国的党校和报纸出版机关内进行了财务检查。
    这便是在总结报告所涉及的时期内党机关的财务预算工作的简略分析。今后的任务是不要放松对各个党机关财务工作的注意。必须消除征收党费工作中还存在着的缺点，做到及时正确地缴纳党费，改善各个党机关的出版工作，节约经费，缩减不必要的开支。检查委员会今后仍应经常检查各党机关的财务工作，注意根据检查结果向各个党机关提出的建议。
    二、
    同志们！在报告期间，中央检查委员会检查了苏共中央各部对劳动者的来信和申诉的处理情况。检查表明，中央各部对这部分工作加强了注意，更有成效地处理了来信和申诉中提到的问题。许多来信中指出某些组织和企业工作中的缺点，这对改善这些组织的工作起了良好的作用。
    州、边区、共和国的检查委员会在各该州、边区的党代表会议及加盟共和国共产党代表大会上所做的总结报告中已经指出，各地方党组织也已经大大改善了审理劳动者的来信、声明和申诉的工作。审理时间缩短了，登记和对处理情况的监督也都有了条理。州委员会、边区委员会和加盟共和国共产党中央委员会开始更多地在书记处会议和常委会上讨论有关来信和申诉的工作情况的问题。但远不是所有的组织对审理劳动者来信、声明和申诉的工作都已经给了应有的重视。分析苏共中央和中央检查委员会收到的来信、声明和申诉，可以看出，其中涉及的很大一部分问题，都可以由相当的组织和主管机关及时审理。但是因为这些组织和主管机关中个别工作人员审理这些来信、声明和申诉往往很草率，不及时给予答复，而且也不能经常正确地解决问题，所以人们不得不向上级机关，直至苏共中央，提出申诉。
    苏共中央及中央检查委员会在1954到1955年收到的全部来信、声明和申诉中，有25％的来信和申诉是关于劳动的问题，即有关物质帮助、医疗和疗养的问题，有关社会保险、发明创造、合理化建议的问题，就是说，照理可以由工会组织、经济组织、苏维埃组织及时顺利解决的问题。还有一个情况可以证明这一点，就是政府各部和各主管机关以及其他许多组织，在1954到1955年送交中央，向党中央委员会和中央检查委员会请示的对来信及申诉的答复，就有145，000件。其中有94，000件，即65％，都被批准了。
    可见，如果最初收到来信和申诉的组织能更注意更及时地加以审理，并予以正确的解决，那就不再需要花费很长时间来做补充审理，劳动者在这些问题上也就没有必要去找上级组织了。
    在最近举行的州、边区党代表会议及加盟共和国共产党代表大会上，许多检查委员会在总结报告中引了不少例子，说明某些党和苏维埃组织用形式主义的态度对待审理劳动者来信和申诉的工作。这里所说的首先是伊万诺夫、奔萨、唐波夫的党组织和其他一些党组织。
    劳动者在寄给苏共中央和中央检查委员会的信件、声明和申诉中说，在政府的许多部和主管机关中，接待来访者的工作还做得非常不好。接待来访者的工作人员往往不能独立解决劳动者向他提出的问题。申诉者如果想见见某一个领导工作者，那就要花很多时间。此外，许多机关规定的接待时间正是工人职员们工作的时间，所以他们也就不能来解决他们所关心的问题。
    例如，要见苏联交通部申诉局局长，就要有专门的许可证。在这个部里，没有专门的许可证就不能到政治部和工人干部处去，而到那里去的铁路运输工作人员，每天却有许多。这种接待来访者的情况在交通部中一直存在到最近。
    显而易见，现在已经是坚决消灭这种不正确的做法的时候了，这种做法显然是违反我们党在这方面的多次指示的。我们的任务就是要消除审理来信、声明和申诉的工作中现存的缺点，在一切党组织、苏维埃组织、经济组织和其他组织中实行严格的接待来访制度。
    在这方面，把弗·伊·列宁关于应如何对待劳动者来信、声明和申诉的指示重提一下是必要的。弗·伊·列宁不止一次地指出，劳动者对苏维埃机关工作的缺点提出的申诉，在实质上就是自下而上的监督。他要求一切苏维埃机关都关心满足劳动者的迫切需要，注意他们提出的警告，迅速地予以反映，把这一切都贯彻在自己的全部活动中。弗·伊·列宁经常号召党不要容忍官僚主义的工作方法，经常斥责个别领导者不学无术、自命不凡、摆党员架子的现象。他指出，官僚主义的、形式主义和事务主义的领导方法同苏维埃政权的本质是不能相容的，必须经常反对拖拉作风、因循怠惰、不负责任，反对不重视劳动者的要求的现象。
    同志们！党的机关除了收到许多劳动者的公正地指出了个别党组织、苏维埃组织、经济组织和其他组织的工作中的缺点或提出一些需要立即加以解决的问题的信件和申诉之外，苏共中央、中央检查委员会和地方党机关也收到了这样一些信件，其中包括匿名信，写信的人为了达到私人的目的，企图诽谤丝毫没有过错的工作人员，臆造出种种莫须有的罪状，使许多党和苏维埃的组织的工作人员不得不来调查这些诬蔑性的谎话。
    我们认为，没有必要对所有这些来信都加以审理。应当把党和其他组织的注意力集中在这样一些公民的来信、声明和申诉上，这些信件公正地批评我们任何一个组织的缺点，并愿意积极帮助党和国家来根除党组织、苏维埃组织、经济组织以及其他组织工作中的某些缺点。（掌声）
    可惜在我们这里还有这样一些共产党员，他们向党中央委员会及中央检查委员会提出申诉说，地方党机关和苏维埃机关不给他们安排工作。调查的结果表明，这些党员中有许多人因为不称职和声名不佳而被解除了领导和负责工作，但他们还一直强求担任以前的工作，对其他工作则断然拒绝。这种人因为自己的过错而长期不做工作的人，是想享受特权，是在等待把他们叫去担任性质、大小都不次于他们被解职前的工作。对这样的共产党员必须加以注意，关于他们不正确的行为应当在他们所在的党组织中个别加以审理。
    三、
    同志们！中央检查委员会检查了苏联共产党中央委员会党监察委员会处理事务的情况，并经查明：在十九次党代表大会后这一时期内，党监察委员会审理了党员和候补党员的44，000多份申诉书和申请书。
    但是，必须向第二十次党代表大会报告的是，在党的十九次代表大会后，苏联共产党中央委员会揭发了党监察委员会机关中的缺点，即在很多的情况下，对党员的个人案件只是通过信件进行审理，或只是由个人而不是由党的监察委员会全体审理。
    两年来，党监察委员会大大地改进了关于审查送交该委员会的申请书和个人案件的工作，纠正了以往所犯的错误。
    在报告所涉及的时期内，我们党进行了巨大的更换党员和候补党员的党证的工作。更换党证，是为了使党证符合于苏联共产党十九次代表大会所采用的党的名称。更换党证还有一个目的，就是整顿党员的登记工作。
    在准备和进行更换党证工作的期间，州委会、边区委员会和加盟共和国共产党中央委员会检查了党务的状况，这就使得我们党能够到处都是有组织地进行更换党证的工作，而使这一工作符合于苏联共产党中央委员会的指示。同时，必须指出：并不是在所有的党组织中都整顿了党务的应有秩序。某些党组织并没有对党员提出必要的要求，并没有养成他们爱护党证和候补党证。因此，就发生了不少遗失党证和候补党证的事件。例如，在1954至1955年期间，党员就遗失了约3万个党证。个别区委会和市委会不根据党员遗失党证的事实作出应有的结论，也不采取措施去加以追查。
    党组织的任务就是：今后仍要加强对党务问题的注意，严格地遵守苏联共产党中央委员会所规定的党员登记制度以及颁发和保存党证的制度，经常地向党员和候补党员说明，要他们对党负责，责成他们爱护党证和候补党证。
    同志们！我们党在召开第二十次代表大会的时候，在实现我们祖国经济方面和国际关系方面的历史任务上，都已获得了新的卓越的成就。
    我们党在召开第二十次代表大会的时候，已经更加团结，在思想上已为马克思列宁主义学说的精神锻炼得更加坚强。毫无疑问，全党、工人阶级、集体农民和人民的知识分子，为了进一步繁荣我们伟大的祖国和保障世界各国人民间的持久和平，一定能积极地以战斗的姿态来实现党的第二十次代表大会的决议（暴风雨般的掌声）。（原载2月16日苏联“真理报”）（新华社）
