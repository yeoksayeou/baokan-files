    Second Match
    Ke Lun
    On the afternoon of the 22nd, the "Gwardia" football team from Krakow, Poland (hereinafter referred to as the Polish team) played a friendly match with the joint team of the Central Institute of Physical Education and the First Machine Football Team of our country (hereinafter referred to as the Joint Team). The entire match ended in a 0-0 draw, which was tense from beginning to end.
    After the match began, the Joint Team adopted an offensive strategy. When the ball was passed to right winger Ding Fengzhang, he lacked the ability to cut in at high speed and couldn't pass the ball into open spaces in time. The ball was intercepted by the experienced Polish team right-back, Bierkürski. During the first half, despite the skillful coordination in attack by the Joint Team's left inside forward, Sun Fucheng, and center forward, Shi Wanchun, which allowed them to reach the Polish team's penalty area multiple times and shoot a total of 11 times, most of the shots went out of bounds due to slow and untimely shooting.
    In the 45 minutes of the first half, Poland organized 23 attacks—11 attacks were coordinated from the center, 5 attacks came from the right wing, and 7 attacks involved cutting in from the left wing—amounting to as many as 18 shots. However, because the Joint Team's defense was tight, none of these attacks were successful.
    After a 10-minute break, the match continued. The mood of the crowd was even more excited, as everyone was concerned about who would win or lose. Although the Polish team was playing against the wind in the second half, their morale was quite high, and their desire to win was even more urgent. In the 16th minute, the Joint Team's goal was in danger when Polish team right inside forward, Biatek, got a chance to shoot within the penalty area. Just when it seemed like a goal was imminent, the Joint Team's center back, Cong Anqing, rushed over to intercept and forcefully kicked the ball out of the right sideline. In the 38th minute, the Joint Team's goal was once again in a tense situation when Polish team left inside forward, Bozek, shot from five or six meters away from the goal. However, this shot hit the Joint Team's goalkeeper and bounced back out, where it was kicked away by the Joint Team's Wang Defa. Afterwards, the Polish team organized several more attacks, but failed to score. The Joint Team, benefiting from the wind in the second half, had 6 shooting opportunities. One ball veered to the right and went out of bounds, while the other 5 were saved by the Polish team's goalkeeper. The Polish team's goalkeeper, Stroniarz, showed particular composure and resourcefulness, saving several dangerous shots. The Joint Team's goalkeeper, Xu Fusheng, also delivered a very impressive performance.
    In this match, the Polish team's forwards were very active, organizing more attacks than they did in their first match against the Beijing Youth Team. Their passing coordination was very smooth, and their stopping and dribbling skills were also very skillful. The Joint Team's defenders and midfielders played very well in the match, displaying a strong fighting spirit. Their close-marking tactics around the penalty area were very successful, making it difficult for the opponent to get easy shots on goal. This was the main reason why the match ended in a draw. However, the Joint Team had several shortcomings in organizing their attacks, such as a lack of coordination, inaccurate passing, too many high balls, slow advancement speed, a lack of solutions when approaching the opponent's goal, and slow and weak shooting motions. These are areas where they should humbly learn from the Polish team.
    The two matches played by the Polish "Gwardia" football team in the capital have made us more aware of the shortcomings of our country's football teams. Our various football teams should humbly learn from the football teams of fraternal countries, diligently study and train hard, and rapidly improve the level of football in our country.

    第二场比赛
    柯轮
    22日下午，波兰克拉科夫市“格尔巴尼亚”足球队（以下简称波队）同我国中央体育学院和第一机械足球联队（以下简称联队）作了一场自始至终都非常紧张的友谊赛。全场比赛以○比○结束。
    比赛开始后，联队就采取了攻势，当球传至右翼丁凤章的时候，他缺乏高速度的切进能力，又不能及时传出空档球，球被波队有经验的右后卫比也库尔斯基截去。在上半时内联队左内锋孙福成、中锋史万春等在进攻中的巧妙配合，虽曾多次攻至波队禁区，共射门11次，但都由于射门动作缓慢，不及时，大多射出界外。
    在上半时的45分钟的比赛中，波兰共组织了23次进攻——从中间配合进攻的有11次，从右翼进攻的5次，从左翼切进的7次——射门的次数达18次之多，因为联队防守严密，都没有奏效。
    休息10分钟后，继续比赛。人们的心情更加激动，谁胜谁负，这是大家一致关心的问题。下半时波队虽然处在逆风的情况下，但士气相当高，争取胜利的心情也更为迫切。16分钟时，联队球门告紧，波队右内锋比亚特克在禁区内获得射门的机会。眼看就要进球了，这时，联队中卫丛安庆急忙赶上抢阻，将球猛踢出右边界外。38分钟时，联队球门又一度紧张，波队左内锋鲍泽克在离球门五、六公尺的地方射门，这一球却正好踢到联队守门员的身上反弹出去，被联队王德发一脚踢跑。以后，波队又曾几次组织进攻，都未能进球。联队下半场处在顺风的有利情况，有过6次射门机会，一球偏右踢出界外，其余5球都被波队守门员救出。波队守门员斯特罗尼亚尔兹表现特别沉着机智，曾多次救出险球，联队的守门员徐福生，也作了很漂亮的表演。
    在这一场球赛中，波队的前锋表现得很活跃，组织了比第一场同北京青年队比赛时更多的进攻。他们的传球配合得很默契，停球、带球等动作也都很巧妙。联队的后卫、前卫在比赛中踢得很出色，战斗意志顽强，他们在禁区前后的紧迫盯人战术很成功，使对方很难得到轻易举足射门的机会。这是这场比赛能够打成平局的主要原因。可是联队在组织进攻中却有不少缺点，如配合不默契，传球不准确，高球过多，推进速度很慢，球到对方球门跟前，缺少办法，射门动作也迟缓无力。这些地方都是应该虚心向波队学习的。
    经过波兰“格尔巴尼亚”足球队在首都的两次比赛，使我们更清楚地看到了我国足球队的缺点。我国各个足球队应该虚心向各兄弟国家足球队学习，勤学苦练，迅速提高足球运动的水平。（附图片）
