Comrades! The report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union provides a profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the domestic situation and international position of the Soviet Union, and summarizes the tremendous historical achievements of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party and its Leninist Central Committee.

The report of the Central Committee is full of profound theoretical content. This report contains scientific arguments on major issues of communist construction under modern historical conditions. It estimates the work of the Central Committee in a spirit of self-criticism, exposes shortcomings in our work, and points out ways to eliminate these shortcomings.

In the summary report of the CPSU Central Committee, Comrade Khrushchev discussed all the main aspects of the life and development of the Soviet state, and planned an extremely huge and magnificent program for further striving for the victory of communism in our country.

Studying the summary of our party's work, the Soviet people see and will always firmly believe that the Communist Party, under the leadership of the Central Committee, unremittingly guides our motherland forward along the Leninist road, and puts all its revolutionary energy, will and organizational ability into realizing the program of building communism.

The founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, V.I. Lenin, pointed out that the victory of Soviet economic construction ultimately determines the outcome of our struggle for the victory of communism. Ilyich said: "The struggle on a world scale has moved to this battlefield. Once we solve this task, we will definitely achieve final victory on an international scale. Therefore, the issue of economic construction is of great significance to us." (Lenin's Complete Works, Volume 32, page 413)

The period after the 19th National Congress, in terms of deploying and implementing huge economic tasks—the tasks of communist construction—was a fruitful period.

The important resolutions adopted by our Party Central Committee in the fields of industry, agriculture, construction, and other sectors of the national economy are of great significance in the victorious solution of these tasks.

The summary report pointed out the brilliant achievements our country has made in further developing the socialist economy and culture. Speaking of agriculture, it is worth mentioning that tens of millions of hectares of wasteland have for the first time begun to serve the people very beneficially, and in the past two or three years we have made great strides in increasing the production of grain, meat, milk, oil and other agricultural products.

A feature of the period summarized is the further improvement of our Party's ideological work. The Central Committee has been conducting and is conducting an unremitting struggle for the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory, for further strengthening the socialist ideological front, and tirelessly caring for the ideological education of Communist Party members and all working people.

In its work, the Central Committee relies on the great heritage of Marxism-Leninism, takes into account new materials of science and practice, new historical conditions, and the experience accumulated by our Party and fraternal communist parties of various countries, develops and enriches Marxist-Leninist theory, and boldly and firmly puts forward and solves some of the most complex domestic and international issues.

If the Central Committee's summary report is understood from this perspective, then the creative application of Marxism-Leninism is vividly reflected in the further in-depth theoretical elaboration of some urgent and important issues, such as: the peaceful coexistence of the two systems, the possibility of preventing war in the modern era, the forms of transition to socialism in various countries, and other issues that are of great importance to the world workers' movement and the communist movement.

The viewpoints of the Central Committee's summary report at the 20th Party Congress, the resolutions of the Congress, and the resolutions of the Central Committee's January, July, and other plenary sessions, will be included in the arsenal of creative Marxism-Leninism. These documents are profound examples of theoretically summarizing the practical problems of communist construction, and are programmatic documents with great theoretical and economic significance.

In the period between the 19th and 20th National Congresses of the CPSU, the unity of the Party and the people has become closer, the astonishingly huge force of the alliance between the working class and the peasantry of our country, the great friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union has been further strengthened, the socialist economic system has become more solid, and the material and cultural living standards of the people have improved.

Our Party constantly strengthens its ties with the masses, accurately reflecting the thoughts, desires and hopes of the Soviet people. The draft directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan once again reflect the will of the Soviet people, their fundamental interests and desires. This historically significant program guarantees a further rapid upsurge in the economy and culture of the Soviet state and all its national republics.

Comrades! We all see, and are very satisfied with, the fact that in recent years our Party has further consolidated the unity of the Party ranks and improved the Party's combat effectiveness in the struggle to realize the general line; we also see how resolutely and thoroughly it has implemented the principles of Party leadership formulated by Lenin.

The Central Committee has consistently implemented the principle of collective leadership in its multifaceted activities. This has enabled our Central Committee to correctly and promptly solve the most pressing and urgent tasks, and to concentrate the strength of the Party and the people on this aspect.

The organizational role of the Central Committee has been enhanced. The Central Committee has unswervingly consolidated the established political line through tenacious and meticulous organizational work. Comrades, it must be clearly stated that raising the level of organizational work of all departments of our Party, all Soviet and economic organs is one of the main levers in the Central Committee's activities to solve some basic problems.

The Central Committee has been very active and vigorous in struggling to implement Lenin's principles in foreign policy. Many very important foreign policy issues have been brilliantly resolved. I am referring to our elimination of the abnormal and unhealthy relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, as well as the resolution of other well-known issues.

The visit of representatives of the great Soviet people to India, Burma, and Afghanistan is a brilliant page in the cause of strengthening peace and international cooperation. Never in history have national leaders of any country, like Comrades Khrushchev and Bulganin in India, Burma, and Afghanistan, spoken frankly with tens of millions and millions of people about issues of great significance to the fate of progressive humanity. (Applause)

Under the complex conditions of the international situation, our Party and state have made significant contributions in a short period of time to the cause of strengthening peace and international cooperation, and to the cause of further consolidating the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

Communism has been placed on the agenda of all mankind. Socialism has successively achieved victory in many countries. Lenin's prediction is being realized: all countries will move towards socialism, and capitalism will perish, and no force can save it from extinction.

Comrades, the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian Communist Party more closely unite their ranks, which are loyal to Marxist-Leninist ideas, around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. With a high sense of patriotic pride in their motherland and with deep gratitude to the Communist Party for the great socialist reforms, they greet the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The working people of Soviet Ukraine offer new achievements in all sectors of economic and cultural construction as a gift to the Party Congress.

The achievements of the Ukrainian Communist Party and the Ukrainian people in recent years are well known, so I would like to talk about only some aspects of the economic and cultural development of the Ukrainian Republic.

Due to its vast industrial, raw material and energy resources, Ukraine occupies a very important position in the Soviet economy. Currently, Ukraine supplies 32% of the total coal production of the entire Union, almost half of the pig iron, 37% of the steel and steel products, almost 60% of the iron sand, and more than a quarter of the machine production of the entire Union.

Donbass miners now mine more than five times the amount of coal mined in 1913. During this period, the production of pig iron has almost increased sixfold, and the production of steel and steel products has increased more than sixfold. The republic's machine-building industry and metal-processing industry have been widely developed; the products of these two industrial sectors, generally speaking, have increased almost ninety-six times compared to before the revolution.

The Ukrainian Republic completed the industrial production level stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan in four years ahead of schedule.

During the last Five-Year Plan, 142 coal mines, 37 blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces, 18 rolling mills and pipe mills, 7 machine-building factories, and some large power stations and many other enterprises were put into production.

Ukraine has established a strong power base. The electricity produced by this republic is now 15 times the total electricity produced by all Tsarist Russia in 1913.

The achievements in the development of heavy industry have created conditions for the further upsurge of light industry and the food industry.

The scale of industrial construction, residential construction, and social and cultural construction in Ukraine is expanding more and more. The well-known resolutions passed down by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Council of Ministers have played a big role in improving the construction work. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev talked in the report about how construction must be frugal, not wasteful. I want to give an example in this regard. In our Ukraine, just by re-examining the design drawings of a part of the construction objects, the waste phenomena expressed in various volute decorations and other decorations were discovered and avoided, and a total of 1.6 billion rubles were saved. With this money, about 450 schools or residences with a construction area of more than 1 million square meters can be built according to standard designs.

The work of merging construction organizations has had great results.

After the collective farmers of Ukraine, the machine operators, and the staff of the state-owned farms executed the tasks prescribed by the January Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party and other well-known resolutions of the Party and the government, the output of some of the most important agricultural products has greatly increased. Last year, the Republic overfulfilled the production plans for grain, sunflowers, vegetables and other crops.

Everyone now knows the advantages of maize, and maize has become one of the main grains in Ukraine. Due to the great expansion of the maize sowing area, the total grain harvest of the republic and the feed reserves for animal husbandry have greatly increased.

The sugar beet production in the collective farms and state farms of Ukraine is better than ever. The average yield is 202 quintals per hectare. This means that 156 poods of sugar can be produced from the sugar beets produced per hectare. Last year, the sugar beet sowing area in the republic reached 1,092,000 hectares.

Ukraine also plans to further expand the maize and sugar beet sowing areas.

Increasing the total grain harvest enables the collective farms and state farms of Ukraine not only to complete, but also to greatly overfulfill the state's grain procurement plan. Ukraine sold more than 160 million poods of grain to the state above the plan, and sold 396 million poods of wheat alone to the state. The plans for selling sunflowers, flax, hemp, fruits, vegetables, volatile oil crops and other crops to the state were also greatly overfulfilled.

Preliminary and significant achievements have been made in overcoming the backwardness of animal husbandry and improving the productivity of livestock products. Collective farms and state farms overfulfilled the procurement and purchase plans for milk, meat, wool, and eggs in 1955. More of these products were sold to the state than in previous years.

The material and cash remuneration for the collective farmers' workdays has been increased.

Due to the rapid development of the republic's productive forces, the material welfare and cultural level of the entire Ukrainian people are constantly improving. The people's lives are getting better and better.

Approximately 7 million people are studying in the republic's universal education schools, secondary schools, specialized schools and institutions of higher learning. Now in Ukraine, for every 10,000 people, there are 180 people studying in institutions of higher learning and secondary technical schools alone, which is more than in any capitalist country.

Cultivating numerous cadres of people's intellectuals is a great victory of the cultural revolution. Soviet literature and art in Ukraine are developing victoriously.

The reason why Ukraine has become what it is now is due to the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, due to the establishment of a worker-peasant regime, due to the fact that it is a free and sovereign state, and that it has formed an alliance and friendship with the fraternal nationalities of all Soviet socialist republics, and due to the victory of the Leninist nationality policy implemented by the Communist Party in our country.

Comrade N.S. Khrushchev said in the summary report that our Party has always made every effort to improve and develop the national economy of each member republic, and to make the culture of each member republic, which is national in form and socialist in content, more prosperous.

The Ukrainian people constantly rely on the great help of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government in their constructive labor.

It can now be said with certainty that Lenin's prediction in his congratulatory message to the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets when he began to turn to peaceful construction in 1921 has been realized. This prediction is that the workers and working peasants of Ukraine will definitely consolidate "the Ukrainian Republic, eliminating all obstacles and conspiracies of the enemy." (Lenin's Complete Works, Volume 32, page 123)

The economic, political and cultural development of Ukraine reflects the greatness of the Party's idea of friendly relations between all nationalities. About 40 years ago, in a letter to the workers and peasants of Ukraine, Lenin instructed the Russian and Ukrainian communists and all working people to be in the closest friendly relations "...and set an example to the working people of the world of the truly consolidated worker-peasant alliance of different nationalities..." (Lenin's Complete Works, Volume 30, page 273). The communists of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and all working people, as well as the people of all nationalities in our country, sacredly abide by this behest of Lenin. The friendship between the nationalities of the Soviet Union is as solid as a rock, and this friendship is a model worthy of emulation by the working people of the world. (Applause)

Of course, the fraternal alliance and close friendship between the Ukrainian nation and all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and the vigorous development of the economy and culture of Soviet Ukraine, are not to everyone's taste. I am referring first of all to the foreign enemies of the Ukrainian people. They will never willingly watch as Soviet Ukraine has become Ukraine that cannot be plundered by the imperialist aggressors and their lackeys - the Ukrainian bourgeois nationalists, these Ukrainian bourgeois nationalists who are afraid of the people's anger and have found refuge in some capitalist countries.

Not long ago, a booklet full of lies, slanders and outlandish fabrications, "Ukraine in the 20th Century," was published in New York. This booklet says that Ukraine's industry in 1951 only reached the level of 1912, Ukraine only produces semi-finished products, and the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station is only a propaganda symbol for Ukraine, because the electricity produced by the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station is all transmitted to Moscow. (The audience is active)

The person who said these nonsense is Manning, an old American spy, an expert in slandering the Soviet Union, and a so-called professor at Columbia University. You see, he told such a big lie, fabricating out of thin air that a power transmission line was erected from the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station to Moscow. Of course, the fabricator himself is not worth caring about, we don't expect him to tell the truth. Pigs cannot sing like nightingales. (Laughter, applause) But why does he bark so fiercely at the Ukrainian people? It seems that he is carrying out the orders of his masters. At the end of this fabricated work, he asked the Western partners of the American imperialists to split Ukraine from the Soviet Union.

There is a good Ukrainian proverb that says, "No matter how the dog barks at the moon, the moon will not lose its brilliance." (Laughter) The Ukrainian people understand very well that only under the banner of Soviet power have they gained freedom and independence, and that in the big family of all Soviet republics they are invincible, and they are not afraid of any conspiracy of the enemy.

The Ukrainian working people also understand very well that in the near future the national economy, science and culture of Ukraine will be raised to a higher level. They clearly see this prospect from the Sixth Five-Year Plan and from the great plan to build a communist society in our country.

During this Five-Year Plan period, the productive forces of the Ukrainian Republic will be further rapidly developed. The output of coal, pig iron, steel, steel products, machinery and other products of heavy industry will be greatly increased. During the Five-Year Plan period, the republic will build many new large factories in heavy industry, light industry and the food industry, as well as new hydroelectric power stations. In 1960, the total grain harvest of Ukraine will reach 2.1 billion poods. The production of sugar beets, vegetables, potatoes and other agricultural products will also increase sharply.

Our republic faces particularly important tasks in increasing the production of meat and milk. Comrade Khrushchev emphasized in the summary report of the CPSU that the task of further developing animal husbandry and increasing the production and procurement of livestock products is one of the most arduous and urgent tasks facing our Party recently.

I would like to talk in more detail about how this problem is being solved in Ukraine now. When formulating measures to implement the resolutions of the January Plenary Session of the CPSU, the collective farms and state farms of the republic, under the leadership of the Party organizations, estimated their possibilities and potential, and decided to reach the amount of livestock products produced in 1960 prescribed by the plenary session for the republic two or three years ahead of schedule. That is to say, the task of producing milk and pork can be completed in 1957, and the task of producing other livestock products can be completed in 1958. We have included these tasks in the new Five-Year Plan. The following materials show how important these tasks are: In 1960, the meat production of Ukraine will account for about 25% of the total meat production of the entire Union, the pork production will account for about 30%, and the milk production will account for 23%.

If it is stipulated that the national meat production will be doubled by the end of the Five-Year Plan, then the collective farms and state farms of Ukraine will be able to double the meat production this year, 1956, compared with last year, and the pork production will be doubled. (Applause)

By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the meat production in the republic's collective farms and state farms will increase to 3.1 times that of 1955, and the pork production will increase to 4.4 times, of which the pork production in the collective farms will increase to about 6 times.

As Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in the summary report, as long as pig farming is developed, meat production can be increased greatly and quickly. This goal will definitely be achieved, because this sector of animal husbandry is the fastest growing sector.

In the past, the collective farms and state farms of the republic raised about 2 million pigs a year, while this year, 1956, the collective farms, state farms and other state-owned enterprises will raise about 8 million pigs.

However, we do not have enough of the necessary quantity in this regard. Therefore, in 1956, in addition to 1 million basic sows, at least 700,000 sows that have had one litter will be used, which will make it possible to obtain 14 million piglets. At the same time, the collective farms and state farms of the republic adopt the method of winter and spring rotation of sows, which will be able to obtain at least 70% of the piglets in the first half of the year, and these young animals will be fed with cheap summer feed, and fattened and handed over to the state after the autumn harvest.

Now, many collective farms and state farms feel that there are not enough pig houses for pig farming. Therefore, the republic has now widely launched the construction of semi-covered pig houses with fattening farms. This makes it possible to organize large-scale fattening and produce very cheap pork.

All collective farms, state farms and auxiliary enterprises have formulated various measures to ensure the unconditional completion of these plans, and have also formulated monthly plans for fattening and supplying pork to the state.

While increasing pork production, the replenishment, grazing and fattening of cattle and sheep will also be improved, as well as the raising of poultry for meat, including waterfowl. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates the construction of a large number of mechanized poultry farms using cages in collective farms and state farms. The construction of this kind of poultry farm has been widely launched; more than 200 such poultry farms will be built this year.

The Party organizations, the Soviet organs and agricultural organs in the collective farms, machine tractor stations and state farms of Ukraine are working hard to further greatly increase milk production. The milk production plan for 1955 was overfulfilled. The average milk yield per cow in the republic's collective farms increased by 217 kilograms compared with 1954, and the total milk production increased by 919,000 tons, an increase of 38%. It is planned to further increase milk production in 1956. The milk in the collective farms will increase to one and a half times that of last year. Preliminary results have been achieved in this regard. In the past four months of the new economic year, the total milk production value of the collective farms has doubled compared with the corresponding period of last year, and the average milk yield per cow has increased by 158 kilograms. During this period, the average milk yield of dairy cows per 100 hectares of agricultural land in the republic's collective farms was 22.5 quintals.

Everyone knows that feed is of decisive significance in increasing meat and milk production. Therefore, the collective farms and state farms of the republic plan to expand the maize sowing area by about 1 million hectares again in 1956, so that its sowing area will reach more than 7 million hectares. Other measures on feed production are also planned to be implemented.

The 19th Congress of the Ukrainian Communist Party, the congresses of all members of the collective farms, the meetings of all staff of machine tractor stations and state farms, the meetings of Party activists, and the meetings of agricultural advanced workers of the republic all expressed a unanimous desire - to complete the meat and milk production plans ahead of schedule.

To this end, the collective farms and state farms of the republic re-examined the previously formulated livestock product production plans, tapped potential, and re-signed socialist competition contracts. Our outstanding animal husbandry workers are enthusiastically engaged in the work of increasing meat and milk production. Everyone knows that, like other republics, we have launched a competition between various states, regions, collective farms, machine tractor stations and state farms to strive to increase the production of grain, meat, milk and other agricultural products.

I would also like to remind everyone in passing why our republics do not compete with each other, and if some republics do compete, it is also informal. Many collective farmers in Ukraine and staff of state farms and machine tractor stations have expressed their hope to organize a competition between republics.

Khrushchev: Who do you want to compete with?

Kirichenko: I said that the two largest republics, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, can compete. (Applause) How to compete? I think that we can first compete to produce the most livestock products, such as milk, per 100 hectares of agricultural land. Everyone knows that there are very good conditions in the states of the Russian Federation when it comes to greatly increasing milk production!

Khrushchev: Yes.

Kirichenko: In terms of meat production, it is difficult for the Russian Federation to compete with us, because we have a very good breeding base.

The competition between various states of different republics is also very good. I think the country will benefit from it. Other republics can also participate in the competition. This will greatly promote the smooth completion of the huge tasks stipulated in the new Five-Year Plan.

Khrushchev: Yes.

Comrades! The Communist Party and the Soviet state face huge tasks. In order to solve these tasks well, we must use all potential, mobilize all working people, all the people of our country, and launch a mass socialist competition. The significance of competition is inestimable. V.I. Lenin discovered in the competition a powerful driving force of Soviet society, this force creates "the possibility of truly large-scale, truly broad use of competition, attracting the vast majority of working masses to participate in this work that enables them to show their skills, to give play to their abilities, to express their talents. ..." (Lenin's Complete Works, Volume 26, page 367)

The Ukrainian Communist Party achieved certain achievements last year due to the conscientious launch of socialist competition to strive to improve the production of grain, livestock products and other agricultural products. Thousands of collective farms have greatly improved their work, and tens of thousands of new advanced workers have grown up on the collective farm production front.

While studying the issue of organizing socialist competition in agricultural production, we exposed many serious shortcomings in this huge mass movement. I want to talk about these shortcomings, because they probably exist elsewhere as well.

What are these shortcomings? In some cases, the competition is boring, and often there are many rigid and formalistic phenomena in organizing the competition, empty propaganda, unnecessary noise, frequent mass meetings, etc. I want to say that there are simply too many empty words. The competition conventions are often formalistic and do not consider the actual specific conditions and utilization of potential. Most importantly, the conventions are often set too high, so that no one believes that the conventions can be completed. And this situation has become very popular, this situation occurs because when formulating individual or collective conventions, especially when the formulated conventions are too high, the leaders of Party organizations, Soviet organs and newspapers, as Khrushchev pointed out in the report, praise those who assume very high obligations. This is of course beneficial and convenient for those who assume such obligations, because these people's reputation will be spread (even for a short time), and the Party and Soviet leaders will also benefit from it, and they can be calm and uneventful, and the "superior" will not particularly touch them, will not criticize them for low and insufficiently tense obligations, and on the contrary, these leaders will be praised from all sides. And some leaders of various regions and collective farms are very proud to receive this praise.

We once checked in our republic and found that some regions, collective farms, work teams and work groups have been assuming very high obligations for many years, but they have never completed these tasks, and no one has seriously asked about this matter.

As usual, the competition convention is signed for a whole year, which gives reason to wait until the end of the year instead of affecting the competition process every day, and only affirming their final achievements later.

We are also correcting this shortcoming. The annual conventions signed now are specific and divided into individual work processes and periods, divided into ten days, divided into weeks, etc., that is, they must be suitable for each form of work. For example, a milkmaid who signs a convention to milk a certain number of kilograms of milk per cow every year, specifying how much milk she will milk in January, how much she will milk in February, how much she will milk in May, and how much she will milk in each month later, and even stipulating how much she will milk every ten days, formulating these standards is to take into account the conditions and feed resources. In this way, not only is it possible for the masses to supervise the execution of tasks and correspondingly affect the results of plan execution, but also for the participants in the competition to pay attention to the competition process and eliminate shortcomings in a timely manner. This makes people accustomed to observing discipline and accustomed to unconditionally completing tasks.

Up to now, our competition is usually a competition between the strong and the strong, a competition between the weak and the weak, an advanced state competes with an advanced state, and an advanced region chooses a region with equal strength as a competition object. The situation is the same between collective farms. Some leaders of collective farms, regions, and even states are looking for weaker opponents, so-called "easier to win," to compete with, and when they sign contracts with them, they are already gearing up in advance and saying: "We will win him, surpass him." In fact, no one has won anything at all. Because this opponent has already laid down long ago, and is a poor thing that should be pulled up. (Laughter) These issues are being studied and mistakes are being corrected.

Up to now, the cost of product indicators is usually not in socialist competition conventions at all. There are indicators only in terms of the total output of products. This is completely wrong. The Ukrainian Party organization is now making efforts to ensure that each competition contract and convention states how many workdays it will take to produce a unit of product.

There are often wrong attitudes in evaluating the winners of the competition.

There are many such situations: two collective farms or two regions are competing, and at the end of the year, the results of both units are very bad, not only have they not completed the guarantee, but they have not even completed the plan, but one of them has achieved a better indicator, and is "crowned" as the winner of the competition. The result is that things have failed, and there is always a winner. (Laughter)

Now we have determined that only collective farms, state farms, or regions participating in the competition must complete or overfulfill the stipulated plan and achieve the best indicators in completing the socialist guarantee before they can be counted as the winners of the competition.

We are correcting the shortcomings in organizing the competition, and our method is to provide necessary help to the efforts of the competitors to complete the guarantee, and to criticize at meetings and in newspapers those leaders who are indifferent to the competition and the competition participants who have not completed the guarantee. Work is now being done vigorously to correct the shortcomings that exist in organizing socialist competition. If necessary, the conditions of the competition can be re-signed. The Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Party now requires ministers of various ministries, leaders of competent authorities, and secretaries of Party state committees, city committees and regional committees to personally take charge of the issue of organizing the competition, help the competitors to complete the guarantee, reward those who are at the forefront, promote the experience of advanced elements, and lead the backward.

In this mass, truly nationwide competition movement, bureaucracy, formalism, and other major shortcomings and distortions that reduce the effectiveness and great creativity of the competition are intolerable. We believe that more attention should be paid to competition now, because it will play a major role in completing the tasks we face.

Everyone knows the significance of adopting advanced experience in socialist construction. This is also talked about in the summary report. The working class, collective farmers, and all our people have widely used advanced experience in the process of realizing several Five-Year Plans.

In order to promote everything new and advanced, the state spends a lot of money in agriculture. You can see that books and pamphlets are published in millions of copies, hundreds of films are distributed, many lectures and reports are held, and the working methods of advanced figures are widely introduced in newspapers and magazines. Visits to advanced collective farms are organized one after another, lectures and seminars are held, and advanced figures are invited to introduce their advanced experience at the meetings. In order to promote advanced experience, we have held an excellent Soviet Agricultural Exhibition.

The large amount of expenses spent by the state on promoting advanced experience must be repaid. But is the situation in every place as it should be? Unfortunately, the situation is far from being so, and the leaders of many states and regions, collective farm chairmen, work team leaders and group leaders are often together with advanced figures, watch movies, listen to reports, visit agricultural exhibitions, but their situation remains unchanged, and advanced methods have not been adopted.

What is the situation we often have in practice? There are two or three commendable advanced collective farms in the region, while the collective farms around them lag behind and develop their economy slowly. In addition, in many collective farms, some work groups and work teams have been advanced for many years in a row, while the collective farms that are backward are still backward. Unfortunately, this situation has not made some leaders of the region feel uneasy. Year after year, they always mention a few advanced collective farms at various meetings, plenary sessions, and congresses, and they always repeat the names of those advanced figures.

For many leaders of Party, Soviet and economic organizations, the matter of adopting advanced experience in production has not yet become the most important Party and state responsibility. And if advanced experience is not adopted, we cannot develop our economy now.

It is necessary to make the atmosphere of studying model examples prevalent everywhere and become an internal matter, as Lenin required. It must indeed become an internal matter, not a voluntary matter. It is necessary to force those leaders who are indifferent to the implementation of advanced experience to adopt advanced working methods. The interests of the state require this.

There are also various shortcomings in our republic in implementing advanced experience, and we are now seriously overcoming these shortcomings.

The issue of promoting advanced experience in production was raised at the work of the 19th Congress of the Ukrainian Communist Party held not long ago. The Congress put forward a very important task to the republic's Party organizations, Soviet organs and economic organs - to make 1956 a year of massively promoting advanced experience in agricultural production. Specifically, if there is an advanced collective farm in a region (and each of our regions has an advanced collective farm), then the leaders of the region have the responsibility to promote the advanced working methods of these collective farms to all collective farms in the region. In each region, each machine tractor station, and each collective farm, there are advanced groups, tractor work teams, field work teams and livestock breeding farms. The primary responsibility of the leaders of the region, machine tractor station, and collective farm is to ensure the promotion of their working experience, and to raise all collective farms, machine tractor stations, work teams and groups to an advanced level.

Comrades! I want to talk a few words about the production cost of agricultural products. Everyone knows that the continuous technological progress of socialist society guarantees the rapid improvement of social labor productivity, which is the decisive condition for the gradual decline of product costs.

For the socialist economy, it is of great significance to produce the largest quantity of superior products under the condition of consuming the lowest labor force and materials. We must win in the economic competition with capitalism, and the victory in solving this task depends to a large extent on this. Everyone knows that lowering the cost of products is the main source of socialist accumulation, is objectively necessary, and is the law of socialist economic development.

However, many Party workers, Soviet workers, and economic workers have not paid enough attention to lowering product costs. The work of striving to reduce labor consumption and material consumption in agricultural product production is done particularly badly. Some leaders of collective farms do not lead the public economy from an economic point of view, but strive to achieve high unit area production indicators or livestock product indicators at any cost. They usually do not analyze the cost of products, nor do they consider the expenses of the state or the collective farm on these products and how to make the products cheaper. Statistics show that, for example, the collective farms in Poltava State, compared with the collective farms in neighboring Kharkiv State, although the soil and climatic conditions are the same, spent 39% more workdays on producing each quintal of grain in 1954, 20% more workdays on sugar beets, and 6% more workdays on meat.

In many collective farms, there are phenomena of uncontrolled expenditure of workdays and bloated administrative staff, which greatly increases the production costs of agricultural products.

In order to lower the cost of agricultural products, the collective farms and machine tractor stations of this republic are currently carrying out the following work: reducing the personnel of the administrative organs, revising various quotas, and implementing some other measures to improve labor organization.

How much funding each region and state saves due to the reduction of the personnel of the administrative organs, I cannot talk about in detail now, but I can say that the entire republic can save several hundred million rubles.

Greatly improving the level of mechanization of agricultural work, widely adopting achievements in agricultural science, and rationally using land create conditions for guaranteeing to obtain as many products as possible per hundred hectares of agricultural land while investing a minimum of labor force and funds. It is also not the case that everything is normal, even in our economics circle, in determining some issues of agricultural product costs, comrades, everyone knows that many of our economists deny the role of the law of value in collective farms, they believe that the category of value cannot be applied to the products produced by collective farms at all. In fact, the application of the law of value has very important significance for the economic management of collective farms, just as it does in industry. We have the right to issue a stern warning to our agronomists, economists, and the entire economics circle and the Soviet

    基里钦科在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！苏联共产党中央委员会的报告对苏联的国内情况和
  国际地位作了深刻的马克思列宁主义的分析，总结了苏联人民在共产党和它的列宁式的中央委员会的领导下所取得的巨大的历史性胜利。
      中央委员会的报告充满了深刻的理论内容，这一报告包含有在现代历史条件下的共产主义建设的重大问题的科学论证，用自我批评的精神估计了中央委员会的工作，揭露了我们工作中的缺点，指出了消灭这些缺点的途径。
    在苏共中央委员会的总结报告中，赫鲁晓夫同志论述了苏维埃国家的生活和发展的一切主要方面，规划了进一步争取在我们的国家获得共产主义胜利的极其巨大的和宏伟的纲领。
      苏联人民研究我们的党的工作总结，看到并且永远坚信，共产党在中央委员会的领导下坚持不懈地引导我们的祖国沿着列宁主义的道路向前迈进，把自己的所有革命精力、意志和组织能力投入实现建设共产主义的纲领中。
    共产党和苏维埃国家的奠基人弗·伊·列宁指出，苏联经济建设的胜利最终决定我们争取共产主义胜利的斗争的结局。伊里奇说：“世界规模的斗争已经转到这个战场上来了。我们一旦解决了这个任务，那我们就一定会最终地在国际范围内取得胜利。因此，经济建设问题对于我们有非常重大的意义。”（列宁全集第32卷第413页）
    在布置和贯彻执行巨大的经济任务——共产主义建设的任务方面，第十九次代表大会以后的时期是卓有成效的时期。
    在胜利地解决这些任务方面，我们的党中央委员会在工业、农业、建筑业和国民经济的其他部门方面采取的一些重要的决议，有很大的意义。
    总结报告指出了我们的国家在进一步发展社会主义经济和文化方面取得的辉煌成就。谈到农业方面，值得特别指出的是，几千万公顷的荒地第一次十分有益地开始为人民服务，近两三年来我们在增产谷物、肉类、牛奶，油类和其他农产品方面迈进了一大步。
    我们党的思想工作的进一步提高也是总结所谈到的时期的一个特点。中央委员会为马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性、为进一步加强社会主义的思想阵地进行了并且正在进行着坚持不懈的斗争，不倦地关怀共产党员和全体劳动人民的思想教育。
      中央委员会在自己的工作中依靠马克思列宁主义的伟大遗产，考虑到科学和实践的新材料、新的历史条件、我们党和各国兄弟共产党积累起来的经验，发展着和丰富着马克思列宁主义理论，大胆地、坚定地提出和解决一些最复杂的国内和国际问题。
    如果从这方面来理解中央的总结报告，那么对马克思列宁主义的创造性运用，鲜明地反映在对一些迫切重要问题的进一步深刻的从理论上的阐明中，这些问题是：两个制度的和平共处、现时代防止战争的可能性、关于各种不同国家过渡到社会主义的形式和其他一些对世界工人运动和共产主义运动有非常重要意义的问题。
    第二十次党代表大会上中央委员会的总结报告的论点、代表大会的决议、中央1月、7月等全会的决议，将列入在创造性的马克思列宁主义武库中，这些文件都是深刻地从理论上概括共产主义建设实践问题的范例，是有重大理论意义和经济意义的纲领性文件。
    在苏共第十九次和第二十次两次代表大会之间的时期中，党和人民的团结更加紧密了，我们祖国的工人阶级和农民的联盟、苏联各族人民的伟大友谊这种惊人的巨大的力量更加加强了，社会主义经济制度更加坚固了，人民的物质和文化生活水平提高了。
    我们的党经常加强自己同群众的联系，准确地反映出苏联人民的思想、愿望和希望。关于第六个五年计划的指示草案再次反映了苏联人民的意志、他们的根本利益和愿望。这一有历史意义的纲领保证苏维埃国家、它的一切民族共和国的经济和文化得到进一步的急剧高涨。
    同志们！我们大家都看到，而且感到非常满意的是，最近几年我们党更进一步地巩固了党的队伍的团结，提高了党为实现总路线而斗争的战斗力；我们也看到，它是多么坚决和多么彻底地实现着列宁所制定的党的领导原则。
    中央委员会在多方面的活动中一贯地执行了集体领导的原则。这样就使得我们的中央委员会有力量能够正确地和及时地解决最迫切的、紧急的任务，并且把党和人民的力量集中到这方面来。
    中央委员会的组织作用提高了。中央委员会以顽强的和细致的组织工作，坚定不移地巩固了已经制定的政治路线。同志们，必须明确地说，提高我们全党、所有苏维埃和经济机关各个环节的组织工作水平，是中央委员会解决一些基本问题的活动中主要杠杆之一。
    中央委员会曾经非常积极和大力地进行斗争，以便在外交政策方面能够实行列宁的原则。很多非常重要的外交政策问题得到了光辉的解决。我指的是我们消除了苏联同南斯拉夫两国之间的不正常和不健康的关系，以及解决了其他一些人所共知的问题。
    伟大的苏联人民的代表在印度、缅甸和阿富汗的访问，是加强和平和国际合作的事业中的光辉的一页。历史上从来没有哪个国家的国家领导人像赫鲁晓夫同志和布尔加宁同志在印度、缅甸和阿富汗那样。坦率地同几十万人和几千万人谈论过对进步人类的命运有重大意义的问题。（掌声）
    在国际局势的复杂条件下，我们的党和国家在不长的时期内对加强和平和国际合作的事业，对进一步巩固以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的社会主义阵营的威力的事业作了重大的贡献。
    共产主义已经提到全人类的日程上来了。社会主义接连在许多国家取得胜利。列宁的这个预言正在实现：各国将走向社会主义，而资本主义将要灭亡，没有任何力量能够使它免于灭亡。
    同志们，乌克兰人民和乌克兰共产党更紧密地把自己的忠于马克思列宁主义思想的队伍团结在苏联共产党中央委员会的周围，怀着对自己祖国的高度的爱国主义自豪感和怀着由于伟大的社会主义改革而对共产党产生的深刻的感谢的心情，来迎接苏共第二十次代表大会。苏维埃乌克兰的劳动人民以在经济和文化建设各个部门中新的成就作为对党代表大会的献礼。
    乌克兰共产党和乌克兰人民最近几年所获得的成就是人所共知的，因此，我想谈的只是乌克兰共和国经济和文化发展的某些方面。
    乌克兰由于拥有巨大的工业、原料和动力资源，在苏联的经济上占着很重要的地位。目前乌克兰供给的煤占全联盟煤产量32％，生铁差不多占一半，钢和钢材占37％，铁砂差不多占60％，机器产量占全联盟四分之一多。
    顿巴斯矿工目前开采的煤为1913年开采量的五倍多。在这个期间，生铁的产量差不多增加到六倍，而钢和钢材增加到六倍多。共和国的机器制造工业和金属加工工业获得了广泛的发展；这两个工业部门的产品，一般说来，差不多增加到革命前的九十六倍。
    第五个五年计划规定的工业生产水平，乌克兰共和国在四年中就提前完成了。
    在上一个五年计划期间投入生产的有：煤矿142个、高炉和平炉37座、轧钢机和轧管机18台、机器制造工厂7所，还有一些大型发电站和很多其他企业。
    乌克兰已经建立了强大的动力基地。目前这个共和国生产的电力为1913年全部沙皇俄国所生产的电力的15倍。
    重工业发展的成就为轻工业和食品工业的进一步高涨创造了条件。
    乌克兰的工业建设、住宅建设和社会文化建设的规模越来越扩大了。苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议通过的著名的决议，在改进建设工作方面起了很大的作用。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中谈到，建筑应该节省，不浪费。我想举个这方面的例子。在我们乌克兰，仅是重新审查了一部分建筑对象的设计图，就发现了和避免了表现在种种涡形装饰以及其他装饰上的浪费现象，结果共节省了16亿卢布。用这些钱按照标准设计可以建造大约450个学校或者建筑居住面积在100万平方公尺以上的住宅。
    合并建筑组织的工作已经有了很大的效果。
    乌克兰的集体农民、机器操使者、国营农场的工作人员执行了苏共中央委员会1月全会所规定的任务以及党和政府的其他著名的决议之后，一些最重要的农产品的产量已经大大增加了。共和国在去年超额完成了谷物、向日葵、蔬菜和其他作物的生产计划。
    玉蜀黍的优点现在大家都已经知道了，在乌克兰玉蜀黍已经成为主要的谷物之一。由于大大扩大了玉蜀黍的播种面积，共和国的谷物总收获量以及供畜牧业用的饲料储备都大大增加了。
    乌克兰集体农庄和国营农场中的甜菜生产比任何时候都好。平均每公顷收202公担。这就是说，用每公顷所生产的甜菜可以制造出156普特的食糖。去年，共和国中甜菜的播种面积达到1，092，000公顷。
    在乌克兰还计划进一步扩大玉蜀黍和甜菜的播种面积。
    增加谷物的总收获量使乌克兰的集体农庄和国营农场不仅可以完成、而且可以大大超额完成国家的粮食采购计划。乌克兰超计划交售给国家的粮食有16，000多万普特，单单小麦就交售给国家39，600万普特。向国家交售向日葵、亚麻、大麻、水果、蔬菜、挥发油作物以及其他的作物计划也大大地超额完成了。
      在克服畜牧业的落后现象和提高畜产品生产率方面已经取得了初步的显著的成就。集体农庄和国营农场在1955年超额完成了对牛奶、肉类、羊毛、鸡蛋的征购和收购计划。交售给国家的这些产品比往年要多。
    集体农民劳动日的实物报酬和现金报酬提高了。
    由于共和国生产力的迅速发展，全体乌克兰人民的物质福利和文化水平正在不断地提高。人民的生活越来越好。
    在共和国的普及教育学校、中等学校、专科学校和高等学校
  中学习的人数大约有700万人。现在在乌克兰，每1万个人中单单是在高等学校和中等技术学校学习的就有180人，即比任何一个资本主义国家都要多。
    培养出许许多多的人民知识分子干部，这是文化革命的巨大胜利。乌克兰的苏维埃文学和艺术正在胜利地发展中。
    乌克兰之所以成为现在这个样子，是由于伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，由于建立了工农政权，由于它是自由的主权国家，它同各苏维埃社会主义共和国的兄弟民族结成了联盟和友谊，由于共产党所执行的列宁的民族政策在我国的胜利。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在总结报告中说，我们党过去和现在始终是尽一切努力来提高和发展各加盟共和国的国民经济，来更加繁荣各加盟共和国的、民族形式和社会主义内容的文化。
    乌克兰人民在自己的建设性的劳动中经常地依靠着苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的巨大帮助。
    现在可以有把握地说，列宁在1921年开始转向和平建设的时候在致全乌克兰苏维埃代表大会的祝词中所作的预言已经实现了。这一预言就是，乌克兰的工人和劳动农民一定会巩固“乌克兰共和国，排除敌人的一切阻挠和阴谋”。（列宁全集第32卷第123页） 
    乌克兰在经济上、政治上和文化上的发展反映了党关于各民族友好的思想的伟大。大约在40年前，列宁在给乌克兰工人和农民的信中嘱咐俄罗斯和乌克兰的共产党员和全体劳动人民要最密切地友好相处“……并且向全世界的劳动人民树立不同民族的真正巩固的工农联盟的榜样……”（列宁全集第30卷第273页）乌克兰的、俄罗斯联邦的共产党员、全体劳动人民以及我国所有各民族人民都神圣地遵守着列宁的这一遗训。苏联各民族之间的友谊坚如磐石，这种友谊是全世界劳动人民值得仿效的榜样。（掌声）
    当然，乌克兰民族同苏联各民族的兄弟联盟和密切的友谊，苏维埃乌克兰的经济和文化的蓬勃发展并不合乎所有的人的口味。我首先指的是乌克兰人民的国外敌人。他们从来不会甘心地看着，苏维埃乌克兰已经成为帝国主义侵略者和他们的走狗——乌克兰资产阶级民族主义者所不能够掠夺的乌克兰，这些乌克兰
  资产阶级民族主义者害怕人民的愤怒，在某些资本主义国家中找到了避难所。
    不久以前，在纽约出版了一本充满谎言、诽谤和无奇不有的捏造的小册子“20世纪的乌克兰”。在这本小册子中说，乌克兰的工业在1951年只达到1912年的水平，乌克兰只出产半制成品，第聂伯水电站仿佛对于乌克兰仅只是一个宣传象征，因为第聂伯水电站生产的电力都是输往莫斯科。（全场活跃）
    说这些胡说八道的话的人就是美国老牌间谍、诽谤苏联的专家、一个哥伦比亚大学的什么教授曼宁。你们看，他撒下了这样的弥天大谎，竟无中生有地说从第聂伯水电站到莫斯科架设了一条输电线。当然，对这位捏造者本人是不值得介意的，我们不期待他会说真话。猪不可能像夜莺一样地歌唱。（笑声，掌声）但是，为什么他要向乌克兰人民这样穷凶恶极地狂吠呢？看来是为了执行他的主子的命令。他在自己这部捏造的著作的结尾中要求美国帝国主义者的西方伙伴把乌克兰从苏联分裂开来。
    乌克兰有一句谚语说得好，“听任狗怎么样向月亮狂吠，月亮也并不因此而减色。”（笑声）乌克兰人民十分明白，只是在苏维埃政权的旗帜下他们才获得了自由和独立，而且在各苏维埃共和国的大家庭中他们是不可战胜的，他们毫不害怕敌人的任何阴谋。
    乌克兰劳动人民还十分明白，在不久的将来乌克兰的国民经济、科学和文化将提高到更高的水平。他们从第六个五年计划中，从在我国建设共产主义社会的伟大计划中清楚地看到了这个前途。
    在这个五年计划时期，乌克兰共和国的生产力将得到进一步迅速的发展。煤、生铁、钢、钢材、机器和重工业的其他产品的产量将大大提高。在五年计划时期，共和国将增建重工业、轻工业和食品工业的许多新的大工厂以及新的水电站。1960年，乌克兰的谷物总收获量将达到21亿普特。甜菜、蔬菜、马铃薯和其他农产品的产量也将急剧增加。
    我们的共和国在增产肉类和牛奶方面面临着特别重大的任务。赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共中央委员会的总结报告中着重指出，进一步发展畜牧业以及增加畜产品的产量和征购量的任务，是我们党最近面临的最艰巨的、也是最迫切的任务之一。
    我想比较详细地谈谈现在在乌克兰怎样解决这个问题。共和国的集体农庄和国营农场在党组织的领导下，在制定关于完成苏共中央1月全会的决议的措施的时候，估计到了自己的可能性和潜力，并且决定提前两年或者三年达到全体会议为共和国规定的在1960年生产畜产品的数额，这就是说，生产牛奶和猪肉方面的任务在1957年就可以完成，生产其他畜产品方面的任务在1958年可以完成。我们已经把这些任务列入新的五年计划中。从下面的材料就可以知道这些任务是多么重大：1960年，乌克兰的肉类产量将占全联盟肉类总产量的25％左右，猪肉的产量约占30％，牛奶产量占23％。
    如果规定在五年计划结束时全国肉类增产一倍，那么乌克兰的集体农庄和国营农场在今年即1956年就能够比去年增产一倍的肉类，而猪肉的产量将增加两倍。（掌声）
    在五年计划结束的时候，共和国集体农庄和国营农场中肉类的产量将增加到1955年的三点一倍，猪肉的产量增加到四点四倍，其中集体农庄的猪肉的产量约增加到六倍。
    正像赫鲁晓夫同志在总结报告中所指出的一样，只要发展养猪业，就能够大量地和迅速地增产肉类。这个目的一定会达到，因为畜牧业中的这一个部门是成长最快的一个部门。
    过去，共和国集体农庄和国营农场一年饲养大约200万口猪，而今年，1956年集体农庄、国营农场和其他国营企业就将饲养约800万口猪。
    但是，在这方面我们没有足够的必要的数量。因此，1956年除去100万口基本的母猪外，还要利用至少70万只下过一次仔猪的母猪，这就可能获得1，400万只仔猪。同时，共和国集体农庄和国营农场采用母猪冬春季轮回产仔法，将可以在上半年获得至少70％的仔猪，这些仔畜将用夏季便宜的饲料来饲养，在秋收以后肥育交给国家。
    现在，许多集体农庄和国营农场感到养猪的房舍不够用。因此，现在共和国已经广泛展开建筑半掩盖式的、带有肥育场的猪舍。这就可以组织大规模的肥育，生产很便宜的猪肉。
    所有的集体农庄、国营农场和辅助企业都制定各种措施保证无条件完成这些计划，还制定肥育和供给国家猪肉的每月的计划。
    在增加猪肉产量的同时，还将改进牛羊的补养、牧放和肥育以及饲养供肉食的家禽，其中包括水禽。第六个五年计划规定在集体农庄和国营农场建设大量的机械化的用笼饲养家禽的养禽场。这种养禽场的建设已广泛展开了；今年就要建设200多个这样的养禽场。
    乌克兰的党组织，集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中的苏维埃机关和农业机关在大力进一步大大增加牛奶产量。1955年的挤奶量的计划超额完成了。共和国集体农庄中的每头牛的平均挤奶量比1954年增加了217公斤，而总的牛奶产量增加了919，000吨，即增加38％。1956年计划进一步增加牛奶产量。集体农庄中的牛奶将增加到去年的一倍半。在这方面已经取得了初步成绩。在新经济年度的过去四个月中，集体农庄的牛奶总产值同去年相应的时期比较，已经增加到二倍，而每头牛的平均挤奶量增加了158公斤。在这一时期中，共和国集体农庄中平均每100公顷的农业用地上奶牛的挤奶量为22公担半。
    大家知道，在增加肉类和牛奶生产方面，饲料有决定性的意义。因此，共和国的集体农庄和国营农场计划在1956年再扩大玉蜀黍的播种面积约100万公顷，以便使它的播种面积共达到700多万公顷。还计划实行其他一些关于饲料生产的措施。
    乌克兰共产党第十九次代表大会、集体农庄全体庄员大会、机器拖拉机站和国营农场全体工作人员会议、党积极分子会议以及共和国农业先进工作者会议在讨论指示草案时都表达了一致的愿望——提前完成肉类和牛奶的生产计划。
    为此，共和国的集体农庄和国营农场重新考虑了以前所拟定的畜产品生产计划，挖掘了潜力，重订了社会主义竞赛合同。我们优秀的畜牧业工作者热情地从事增加肉类和牛奶生产的工作。大家都知道，我们同其他共和国一样，在各州、区、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场之间展开了竞赛，争取增加粮食、肉类、牛奶和其他农产品的生产。
    我顺便还想提醒大家注意，为什么我们共和国之间不竞赛，如果说有一些共和国竞赛的话，那也是非正式的。乌克兰有许多集体农庄庄员以及国营农场和机器拖拉机站的工作人员表示，希望组织共和国与共和国的竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫：你们想同谁竞赛呢？
    基里钦科：我说，乌克兰和俄罗斯联邦这两个最大的共和国可以竞赛。（掌声）怎样竞赛呢？我认为，我们可以首先竞赛争取在每一百公顷农业用地上出产最多的畜产品，譬如说是牛奶。大家知道，谈到大大增加牛奶产量，在俄罗斯联邦各州中有很好的条件！
    赫鲁晓夫：对。
    基里钦科：在肉类生产方面，俄罗斯联邦就很难与我们竞赛，因为我们有很好的饲养基地。
    不同的共和国的各个州之间的竞赛也是很好的。我想，国家会因此而得到好处。其他共和国也可以参加竞赛。这在很大程度上会促进顺利完成新的五年计划所规定的巨大任务。
    赫鲁晓夫：对。
    基里钦科：同志们！共产党和苏维埃国家面临着巨大的任务。为了很好地解决这些任务，我们必须利用一切潜力，把全体劳动人民、我国全体人民动员起来，开展群众性的社会主义竞赛。竞赛的意义是难以估价的。弗·伊·列宁从竞赛中发现了苏维埃社会的强大动力，这种力量造成“真正大规模地，真正广阔地运用比赛的可能，吸引真正大多数劳动群众来参加这种使他们能显现自己身手，能发挥自己能力，能表露出自己才干的工作。……”
  （列宁全集第26卷第367页）
    乌克兰共产党在去年，由于认真地展开了社会主义竞赛以争取提高谷物、畜牧业产品及其他农产品的生产，获得了某些成绩。成千的集体农庄大力改进了工作，集体农庄生产战线上成千成万的新的先进工作者成长起来了。
    我们在研究组织农业生产中的社会主义竞赛的问题的同时，揭露了这个巨大的群众运动中的许多严重的缺点。我想谈谈这些缺点，因为其他地方大概也是存在着这些缺点的。
    这些缺点是什么呢？在某些情况下竞赛是枯燥乏味的，组织竞赛时往往有许多刻板的、形式主义的现象，空洞的宣传，不必要的喧嚷，动不动就举行群众大会等等，我要说，空话简直是太多太多了。竞赛公约往往是形式主义的、不考虑实际的具体条件和潜力利用的情况。最主要的是，公约规定得往往偏高，以致谁也不相信能够完成公约。而这种情形已经很流行了，这种情况之所以发生，是因为当在制定个人或集体公约的时候，特别是制定的公约偏高的时候，党组织、苏维埃机关和报纸的领导人正如赫鲁晓夫在报告中指出那样，对那些承担很高的义务的人备加赞扬。这对那些承担这样的义务的人当然是有利的和方便的，因为这些人的名声就会传出去了（即使是短时间的），而党和苏维埃的领导人也因此沾了光，可以平静无事，“上级”不会特别触动他们，不会批评他们义务偏低，不够紧张，而且相反，这些领导人会受到多方的赞扬。而各区和集体农庄的某些领导人就很得意地领受这种赞扬。
    我们曾经在我们那个共和国中检查过，发现了一些区、集体农庄、工作队和工作组许多年来一直是承担很高的义务的，可是它们从来没有完成这些任务，也没有人认真地过问这件事。
    照例，竞赛公约一订就是一整年，这一来就有理由一直等到年底，而不是每天去影响竞赛进程，到以后才来肯定他们的最后成绩。
    这个缺点我们也在纠正。现在所订的年度公约是具体的，分成个别的工作过程和时期，分成旬、分成周等等，也就是要适合每种形式的工作。譬如一个挤奶女工，她订出了每年每头奶牛要挤多少公斤牛奶的公约，注明她在1月份要挤多少奶，2月份要挤多少，5月份要挤多少，以后每个月要挤多少，甚至于规定每旬要挤多少，制定这些标准是要考虑到条件和饲料资源的。这样一来，不仅使群众有可能监督任务执行的情况和相应地影响计划执行的结果，而且使参加竞赛的人也可以注意竞赛的进程，及时地铲除缺点。这使人习惯于遵守纪律，习惯于无条件地完成任务。
    到目前为止，我们的竞赛通常是强的跟强的竞赛、弱的跟弱的竞赛，先进的州跟先进的州竞赛，先进的区挑选跟自己力量相等的区作为竞赛对象。集体农庄之间竞赛的情况也是这样。有些集体农庄、区、甚至州的领导人寻找较弱的、所谓“比较容易取胜的”对手进行竞赛，同他们订合同的时候就已经预先摩拳擦掌地说：“我们会赢他，胜过他。”其实，根本没有赢了什么人。因为这个对手老早就已经躺下，是个可怜虫，应该把他拉起来。（笑声）这些问题正在研究中，错误正在纠正中。
    到目前为止，在社会主义竞赛的公约中通常根本没有产品成本的指标。只有在产品的总产量方面才有指标。这是完全不对的。乌克兰党组织现在作出努力，使每一个竞赛合同和公约中说明，生产单位产品将花多少劳动日。
    在评定竞赛的胜利者方面经常存在着错误的态度。
    有不少这种情况：两个集体农庄或者两个区进行竞赛，年底一总结，两个单位的成绩都很坏，都是不但没有完成保证，而且甚至没有完成计划，不过其中总有一个所达到的指标比较好些，而“被封为”竞赛的胜利者。结果是事情失败了，而胜利者总有一个。（笑声）
    现在我们确定，参加竞赛的集体农庄、国营农场、或者区必须完成或者超额完成规定的计划并且在完成社会主义保证方面达到最好的指标，才能够算为竞赛的胜利者。
    我们在纠正组织竞赛中的缺点，我们的方法是对竞赛者完成保证的努力给予必要的帮助，在集会上和报纸上批评那些对竞赛漠不关心的领导者以及没有完成保证的竞赛参加者。现在在大力进行工作来纠正在组织社会主义竞赛中存在的缺点。在必要的情况下可以重订竞赛的条件。乌克兰共产党中央委员会现在要求各部部长、主管机关的领导者、党州委会、市委会和区委会的书记亲自掌握组织竞赛的问题，帮助竞赛者完成保证，奖励走在前头的人，推广先进分子的经验，带动落后的人。
    在这种群众性的，真正全民的竞赛运动中，官僚主义、形式主义以及降低竞赛的效能和伟大创造力的其他大的缺点和歪曲，都是令人不能容忍的。我们认为，现在应该更加注意竞赛的事情，因为它对完成我们面临的任务将起重大的作用。
    在社会主义建设中采用先进的经验的意义是大家都知道的。总结报告中也谈到了这一点。工人阶级、集体农民和我们全体人民在实现几个五年计划的过程中都广泛地利用了先进经验。
    为了宣传一切新鲜事物和先进的东西，国家在农业中花费很多钱。你们可看见，书籍和小册子在几百万几百万册地出版，影片发行了几百部，举办许多次演讲和报告，在报章杂志中广泛地介绍先进人物的工作方法。纷纷组织到先进集体农庄的参观，举办演讲会和座谈会，并且邀请先进人物在会上介绍自己的先进经验。为了宣传先进经验，我们已经举办了出色的苏联农业展览会。
    国家用在宣传先进经验的大批费用，一定可以得到偿还。但是是不是每一个地方的情况都是像应有那样呢？可惜，情况远远不是这样，许多州和区的领导者、集体农庄主席、工作队长和组长经常同先进人物在一起，看电影，听报告，参观农业展览会，而他们的情况还是不变，先进方法并没有被采用。
    我们在实践中经常有怎样的情况呢？在区里有两三个值得赞扬的先进集体农庄，而在它们周围的集体农庄落在后面，缓慢地发展经济。此外，许多集体农庄里有一些工作组和工作队一连多年都是先进的，而集体农庄落后的，还是落后。遗憾得很，这种情况并没有使区的一些领导者感到不安。他们年年在各种会议、全体会议、代表大会上老是提着几个先进集体农庄，老是翻来复去地提着那些先进人物的姓名。
    对党、苏维埃和经济组织的许多领导者来说，在生产中采用先进经验的事情至今还没有成为最重要的党和国家的责任。而如果不采用先进经验，我们现在就不能够发展我们的经济。
    必须要做到像列宁所要求的那样，学习模范事例的风气流行各处，并且成为一种分内的事情。的确要成为一种分内的事，而不是自愿的事。必须要强迫那些对实行先进经验漠不关心的领导人采取先进的工作方法。国家利益要求这样。
    我们共和国中在实行先进经验方面也有种种的缺点，现在已经认真地来克服这些缺点。
    在不久以前举行的乌克兰共产党第十九次代表大会的工作中就提出了在生产中推行先进经验的问题。代表大会向共和国的党组织、苏维埃机关和经济机关提出了一项十分重要的任务——使1956年成为在农业生产中大量推广先进经验的一年。具体的说就是这样，如果一个区中有先进的集体农庄（我们每个区都是有先进的集体农庄的），那末区的领导人就有责任把这些集体农庄的先进的工作方法推广到全区的集体农庄中去。在各区、各机器拖拉机站、集体农庄都有先进的小组、拖拉机工作队、田间工作队和牲畜饲养场。区、机器拖拉机站、集体农庄的领导者的首要的责任就是保证推广它们的工作经验，把所有的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、工作队和小组都提高到先进的水平。
    同志们！我想就农产品生产成本谈几句话。大家知道，社会主义社会不断的技术进步保证了社会劳动生产率的迅速提高，这就是产品成本节节下降的决定性条件。
    对社会主义经济来说，在消耗最低的劳动力和物资的情况下生产最大数量的上等产品，是有重要意义的。我们要在同资本主义的经济竞赛中取得胜利，在很大程度上要靠这一任务的胜利解决。大家知道，降低产品成本是社会主义积累的主要泉源，是客观必要的，是社会主义经济发展的规律。
    然而，许多党工作人员、苏维埃工作人员、经济工作人员没有对降低产品成本作足够的注意。争取降低农产品生产中的劳动消耗和物资消耗的工作做得特别糟糕。有些集体农庄的领导人不是从经济观点来领导公有经济，而是不惜用任何代价来争取达到高度的单位面积生产指标或是畜产品指标。他们通常不去分析产品的成本，也不考虑国家或是集体农庄在这些产品上面的花费和如何使产品更便宜。据统计证明，譬如波尔塔发州的集体农庄同邻州哈尔科夫州的集体农庄比较，虽然土壤和气候条件都一样，但1954年花在生产每一公担谷物上的劳动日要多39％，而甜菜的劳动日要多20％，肉类的劳动日要多6％。
    在许多集体农庄中都有无控制地支出劳动日和行政管理人员编制臃肿庞大的现象，这就使农产品的生产费用大大昂贵了。
    为了降低农产品的成本，这个共和国的集体农庄和机器拖拉机站目前正在进行下列工作：裁减行政管理机构的人员，修订各种定额，实行改善劳动组织的一些其他措施。
    各区和各州由于裁减行政管理机关的人员而节省的经费究竟有多少，我现在不能够详细地谈，但是可以这样说，整个共和国可以节省好几亿卢布。
    大大地提高农业工作的机械化水平，广泛地采用农业科学上的成就，合理地使用土地，这一切就为保障在投入最低限度的劳动力和资金的每百公顷的农业用地上获得尽可能多的产品创造了条件。也并不是一切都是正常的，就是在我们的经济学界，在确定农产品成本的一些问题上，同志们，大家知道，我们有许多经济学家否定价值规律在集体农庄中的作用，他们认为价值的范畴根本不能应用在集体农庄所生产的产品上的。其实，运用价值规律对集体农庄的经济管理，正如在工业中那样，具有非常重大的意义。我们有权向我们的农学家、经济学家、以及整个的经济学界和苏联科学院提出严正的警告：农业生产方面许多迫切的经济问题，首先是降低生产费用和农产品成本的问题直到目前还没有解决。
    在实现用最少的劳动力和物资而增加农产品生产的任务方面，机器拖拉机站起着决定性的作用。然而，机器拖拉机站，不管它们执行向国家交售实物农产品的计划的情况如何，它们的经费总是有保证的，这样，就使得许多机器拖拉机站的领导人不去注意经济问题，也不去考虑这些产品使国家花费了多么大的代价。
    很多机器拖拉机站的领导人所追求的是使每一公顷的土地成为标准耕地，而把主要的，即获得最大数量产品这件事忽略了，他们不去研究怎样使机器拖拉机站降低在总产量上每一公担的费用和在实物报酬上每一公担的费用的问题，也不去研究增加机器拖拉机站收入的问题。
    必须大大降低国家在作为实物报酬用的单位产品上的费用。这就要求根本上改善对技术的利用，扩大农业生产各个部门的机械化，首先是田间操作和畜牧业方面费力工作的机械化，保证使机器操使者能够完成和超额完成每班的工作定额。
    还必须在全年工作中更适当地和更合理地使用机器拖拉机站的固定干部，使机器修理费大大的减少，并且要节省使用燃料和其他物资。
    我认为，所有这些问题都值得党组织，特别是地方党组织严重的注意。
    把春播的准备工作做好和做得及时是当前最重要的事情，因为这件事情关系到今年的收成。乌克兰党组织对这个问题十分重视。这个共和国的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场在这方面作了很多工作，如准备种籽、拖拉机和其他机器，运送肥料以及为进行播种和翻耕播种地准备大量人力。但是，我应当说，集体农庄和国营农场今年在全部种植玉蜀黍的土地上第一次播种特号种籽这事件是很重要的，我们今年种植玉蜀黍的面积将达700多万公顷。
    同志们！乌克兰的共产党员一致拥护苏共中央委员会的路线和活动。乌克兰共产党不久以前召开的代表会议和代表大会表明了这一点，也证实了乌克兰共和国各级党组织是坚定不移地团结在苏共中央委员会的周围的。
    乌克兰全体人民也一致拥护我党中央委员会的路线和活动。在工人、集体农民和知识分子举行的大会上讨论第六个五年计划指示草案的时候特别明显地表明了这一点。
    苏维埃乌克兰的劳动人民深深理解他们面临着光荣的任务，他们将不吝惜自己的力量和精力为光荣的实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的具有历史意义的决议而努力工作。（经久不息的掌声）　（原载2月16日苏联“真理报”）
