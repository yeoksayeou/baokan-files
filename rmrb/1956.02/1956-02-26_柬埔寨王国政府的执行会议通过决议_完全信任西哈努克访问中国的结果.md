    新华社河内24日电　金边消息：据金边电台23日晚广播，柬埔寨王国政府的执行会议在2月22日通过了一项给西哈努克亲王的决议，表示愿意完全信任和共同来保卫西哈努克亲王访问中国的结果，并且对中国政府和全体中国人民给予亲王和代表团的热忱的接待表示欢迎。
    决议说，我们听取了柬埔寨王国访问中国代表团的团员桑·年关于西哈努克亲王访问中国的情况的报告，知道了代表团得到中国人民的隆重欢迎，以及西哈努克亲王和周恩来总理的会谈已经赞成五项原则，建立了友好关系和经济文化关系。
    决议说，这件事情是很重大的，只有五六百万人口的柬埔寨很荣幸地和有六亿人口的大国完全平等和自由的建立了友好关系，柬埔寨的国旗和中国的国旗平列地飘扬着。
    决议说，我们愿意接受这样的结果，以保卫和平和中立政策。
    新华社河内25日电　金边消息：从中国访问回来的柬埔寨王国会议副议长桑·年从2月21日到23日连续在金边电台报告了王国国家代表团访问中国的情况以后，2月24日，桑·年又应柬埔寨公众的要求继续作了访问报告。
    桑·年在报告中着重向公众解释了和平共处的五项原则。他说：“我所以敢作这样解释，是因为我深知人类的意愿是互不侵犯。”
    在谈到西哈努克亲王在北京曾把柬埔寨王国最高勋章赠给毛泽东主席和周恩来总理这件事的时候，桑·年说：“这些最有价值的礼品，显示了柬中两国的友谊和我们诚恳地在五项原则的基础上团结了起来。”他还说：“我们和中国建立友好关系，并不是我们已跟随中国的制度，我们是和中国一起实现我们已经赞成的五项原则。”
    桑·年在谈到他们在中国期间离开北京到上海参观访问所受到的热烈欢迎的时候说，这种热烈欢迎“是对全柬埔寨民族的友好表示”。
