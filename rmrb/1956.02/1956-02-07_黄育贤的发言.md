Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of the other vice-chairmen and government leaders. These reports have given me a deeper understanding of how our socialist transformation and socialist construction are advancing at an even greater speed and scale. Our country will likely emerge in a not-too-distant future as a fully modernized, highly cultured, prosperous, and powerful socialist industrialized nation in the world. We intellectuals in the engineering and technical fields should actively respond to the call of the Party and the government, work hard to transform our thinking, delve into our professional work, and improve our political and technical levels. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we should faithfully, actively, and wholeheartedly serve the socialist construction of our motherland, contributing all our strength.

Currently, our country is in the high tide of the great socialist revolution. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce is progressing rapidly and has achieved basic victory. Socialist industrial construction is also proceeding on a large scale. As an engineering and technical personnel in hydropower construction, I would like to talk about issues related to hydropower construction. The electric power industry is one of the leading industries in national industrialization and is the foundation of national economic development. Hydropower generation is an important component of the electric power industry, possessing many advantages such as low cost, flexible operation, fuel conservation, and benefits to national defense. At the same time as building hydropower stations, rivers can be comprehensively utilized, achieving enormous benefits in flood control, irrigation, and navigation. Giant hydropower stations and steel plants are crucial factors in determining industrial zones. Our country has numerous rivers and extremely rich hydropower resources, but floods and droughts also occur frequently, so developing hydropower resources is of particular importance.

The Soviet Union's 30-plus years of socialist construction have fully demonstrated that the rational development and full utilization of natural hydropower resources are only possible under the socialist economic system, and it has already achieved tremendous and brilliant successes. The recently announced draft of the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan points out that the total power generation capacity of hydropower stations will increase to 2.7 times the current level. The construction of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydropower stations will be completed, putting them fully into production. The construction of the largest hydropower stations will be carried out in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union, such as the first part of the Bratsk Hydropower Station (with a planned total power generation capacity of 3.2 million kilowatts), the Krasnoyarsk Hydropower Station on the Yenisei River (with a power generation capacity of 3.2 million kilowatts), and other large hydropower stations.

The Soviet Union's hydropower construction has been able to achieve such great and brilliant success because it is inseparable from the importance attached to it by the Soviet Communist Party and the government, as well as the vigorous development of hydropower resources. There is no doubt that we should learn from the Soviet Union in all aspects of our future hydropower construction.

In order to rapidly lay the foundation for the hydropower construction industry, we must first do a good job in the survey of hydropower resources in the next two years. Because this work is not only related to the construction of hydropower stations, but also prepares necessary data for the entire national economic construction, it is closely related to the central departments, especially the issues related to the water conservancy departments. Therefore, I hope that the relevant central and local departments can give strong support and cooperation, and work together to complete this arduous and glorious task.

While carrying out the survey of hydropower resources, we should make long-term and comprehensive plans for hydropower construction. The development speed of hydropower construction should be adapted to the development speed of all important industries in the country, and it needs to be even faster. When we are planning hydropower construction, we should pay special attention to the comprehensive utilization of rivers, that is, we must comprehensively consider the present and future, upstream and downstream, and the maximum interests of this department and that department in relation to rivers and the national economy. In the past, in the Guanting Reservoir, the Meishan and Foziling Reservoirs on the Huai River, we caused some defects because we did not give thorough consideration to the comprehensive utilization of rivers. Last year, with the help of Soviet experts, we completed the planning report for the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River, which is a model for our future comprehensive utilization and development of rivers. Now the comprehensive utilization and development of the Yangtze River is also collecting data. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, the comprehensive utilization plan for the Yangtze River will be completed soon.

At present, our country is in the high tide of agricultural cooperation, which will inevitably be followed by a high tide of agricultural production. Therefore, the construction of rural small hydropower stations is of particular importance. In addition to suggesting that the water conservancy and agricultural departments do a good job in planning, it is also suggested that the National Bank provide planned and focused long-term loans of 5 or 10 years to agricultural production cooperatives for investment in construction. Technically, it will be led by the central or local water conservancy departments. For the improvement of existing rural water conservancy machinery such as water mills, bucket elevators, and waterwheels, and for the design and manufacture of rural small hydropower station water turbine generators, it is recommended that relevant departments immediately start work.

According to the needs of the country's socialist construction, not only is the development speed of the hydropower construction industry very fast, but also the scale is very large. However, the foundation of hydropower is relatively weak. The existing technical strength cannot meet the increasingly heavy tasks. In particular, there is a shortage of personnel for geological survey and design and operation of construction mechanization. Therefore, the training of technical cadres and skilled workers is particularly important. Not only are many numbers needed, but also high technical levels are required. In addition to solving the problem by training and promoting from our own advanced skilled workers and young technical cadres, it is also hoped that the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Higher Education can train a large number of outstanding geological survey, design, and construction new forces for our country's hydropower construction industry.

At present, the engineering and technical personnel in our hydropower construction units, including myself, still have more or less various remnants of bourgeois ideology, which requires us to strengthen political study and strictly criticize non-proletarian ideas. There are also varying degrees of conservative thinking in technology. For example, the safety factor in design is too large, there is waste of building materials, the potential capabilities of equipment and the enthusiasm of workers have not been fully utilized, and the construction speed can be accelerated, etc. In order to overcome and criticize these conservative ideas, the only correct way is to step up the study of Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought, accelerate our ideological transformation, and learn the world's most advanced Soviet science and technology knowledge and achievements.

I solemnly guarantee to the motherland here: I myself and the technical personnel in the hydropower posts resolutely and conscientiously implement the instructions of Chairman Zhou Enlai and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo on intellectuals, step up self-transformation, expand the team, closely unite with other scientific and technical workers, and march towards modern science; under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will jointly serve the socialist economic construction of the motherland; strive to support the liberation of Taiwan; and strive to make the scientific and technological level of our great motherland catch up with the advanced world level in a short period of time.

    黄育贤的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告以及其他几位副主席和政府首长的报告。通过这些报告，使我更深切地体会到我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业正在以更大的速度和规模向前发展。我们的国家将有可能在一个不很长的时间内，以一个完全现代化的、有高度文化的、富强的、社会主义工业化大国出现于世界。我们工程技术界的知识分子，应该积极响应党和政府的号召，努力改造思想，钻研业务，提高政治和技术水平，在党和毛主席的领导下，忠实地积极地全心全意地为祖国的社会主义建设服务，贡献出我们的一切力量。
    目前我国正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中，对农业、手工业、以及资本主义工商业的社会主义改造正在突飞猛进，并且已经得到了基本的胜利。社会主义工业建设也正在大规模地进行。作为一个水电建设的工程技术人员，我愿就有关水电建设方面的问题谈一谈。电力工业是国家工业化的先行工业之一，是国民经济发展的基础。水力发电是电力工业中的一个重要组成部分，具有许多的优越条件，如成本低，运行灵活，节约燃料，利于国防等。在建设水电站的同时，又可以使河流得到综合利用，在防洪、灌溉、航运等方面都能获得巨大的效益。巨大水电站和钢铁厂是决定工业区的重要条件。我国河流众多，水力资源极为丰富，但是水灾旱灾也常有发生，因此开发水力资源就更有特殊重要意义。
    苏联30多年的社会主义建设，充分证明了自然界水力资源的合理开发和充分利用，只有在社会主义经济制度下才有可能，并且已经获得了巨大的辉煌的成就。最近公布的苏联第六个五年计划草案指出，水电站的总发电能力将增为现有的二点七倍。完成古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站的建筑工程，使它们全部投入生产。在苏联东部地区开展最大的水电站的建设工程，如布拉次克水电站的第一部分（全部计划发电能力为320万瓩），叶尼塞河上的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站（发电能力为320万瓩）及其他各个大型的水电站。
    苏联水电建设能够获得这样巨大的辉煌的成就，这与苏联共产党和政府的重视以及大力开发水力资源是分不开的。毫无疑问，今后我们的水电建设应该全面地向苏联学习。
    为了能迅速地给水电建设事业打下基础，在今明两年内我们首先必须做好水力资源的普查工作。因为这项工作不仅关系到水电站的建设，同时对整个国民经济建设准备必要的资料，与中央各部门关系甚为密切，特别是与水利部门牵联的问题更多。因此希望各有关的中央和地方部门能大力给予支持和协作，共同为完成这一艰巨和光荣的任务而努力。
    在开展水力资源普查的同时，应做好水电建设长远的和全面的规划。水电建设的发展速度应与国家所有重要工业的发展速度相适应，并且还需要快一些。我们在进行水电建设的规划时，应该特别注意河流的综合利用，即是要全面考虑河流和国民经济的现在和将来、上游和下游、这个部门和那个部门的最大利益。过去我们在官厅水库、淮河的梅山和佛子岭水库工程中，因为在河流综合利用的问题上考虑欠周，造成了一些缺陷。去年在苏联专家的帮助下，我们已经完成了黄河综合利用的规划报告，这是我们今后对河流综合利用开发的典范。现在长江的综合利用开发也正在搜集资料。我们相信在共产党的正确领导以及苏联专家的无私帮助之下，长江的综合利用规划不久就可完成。
    目前我国正处在农业合作化的高潮中，随之而来的必将是农业生产的高潮。因此建设农村小型水力发电站就具有特殊重要的意义。除建议水利和农业部门作好规划外，也建议国家银行有计划有重点地以5年或10年的长期贷款给农业生产合作社投资建设。在技术上由中央或地方的水利部门领导。对于现有农村水利机械如水磨、筒车、水车等的改良，农村小型水电站水轮发电机的设计和制造，建议有关部门立即着手进行。
    根据国家的社会主义建设的需要，不但水电建设事业发展的速度很快，而且规模也很大。可是水电的基础是较为薄弱的。现有的技术力量不能与日益繁重的任务相适应。特别是地质勘测和施工机械化的设计及运转人员不足，因此对于技术干部和技术工人的培养就显得特别重要，不仅数量需要很多，而且技术水平也要求较高。除了我们自己从先进的技术工人和青年技术干部中培养提拔来解决以外，也希望地质部和高教部能给我国的水电建设事业培养大批优秀的地质勘测以及设计和施工的新生力量。
    目前在我们水电建设单位里的工程技术人员，包括我自己在内，仍然存在着或多或少各种各样的资产阶级思想残余，需要我们加强政治学习，对非无产阶级的思想进行严格的批判。在技术上也存在着不同程度的保守思想，比如在设计的安全系数有的偏大、建筑材料的浪费、设备潜在能力和工人积极性没有充分发挥、建设速度可以加快等等问题上都反映了出来。为了克服和批判这些保守思想，唯一正确的办法就是加紧学习马克思列宁主义的理论和毛泽东思想，加速我们的思想改造，学习世界上最先进的苏联科学技术知识和成就。
    我在这里向祖国严肃地提出保证：我自己和水电岗位上的技术人员，坚决地、认真地贯彻周恩来主席和郭沫若副主席对于知识分子的指示，加紧自我改造，扩大队伍，紧密地团结其他科学技术工作者，向现代科学大进军；在共产党和毛主席英明的领导之下，共同为祖国的社会主义经济建设服务；为支援解放台湾而斗争；为使我们伟大祖国的科学技术水平在短期内赶上先进的世界水平而努力。
