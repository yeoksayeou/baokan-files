Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 11th: The Japan National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution held a plenary session of its Executive Committee in Tokyo on February 10th, formally deciding on its 1956 campaign plan. The plan stipulates that from February to June, a signature campaign against military bases will be conducted nationwide. At the same time, the Federation will establish branch organizations at the prefectural and municipal levels. During the Japanese House of Councillors election in June, the Federation will recommend candidates who support the Constitution; and after holding a national representative conference in August, it will launch a nationwide signature campaign against constitutional revision. The meeting passed a resolution opposing the Japanese government's establishment of a "Constitutional Investigation Committee" and the implementation of the single-seat constituency system.
