    Build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Ahead of Schedule
    Peng Min, Director of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau
    The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that the railway portion of the new railway-highway Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge should be open to traffic in 1958, and the highway portion in 1959. Can it be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule? Judging from the work of the past year, it can be completed ahead of schedule!
    Why can it be completed ahead of schedule? First of all, the situation has changed. Before 1954, the preliminary design proposed using the pneumatic caisson method to build the foundations. With this method, construction could only be carried out for three months a year, and a large amount of mechanical equipment was required. Especially working in high-pressure air, the health and lives of the workers were not guaranteed. Now, according to the suggestion of Soviet experts, the "pipe column drilling method" is used to build the foundations. Full-scale construction of the mid-river pier began officially last September. The construction proved that with the "pipe column drilling method," we are fully confident in constructing all eight bridge piers of the Yangtze River Bridge simultaneously at the beginning of this year. This situation fundamentally broke the old concept of only being able to build two or three bridge piers in a single dry season, and accelerated the construction process of the Yangtze River Bridge. Our steel beam installation and foundation engineering will also adopt some parallel operations. In this way, the construction time for the Yangtze River Bridge will not be 3 years and 4 months, but will be greatly shortened.
    Over the past two years, the technical strength of the bureau has grown rapidly, and labor productivity has increased rapidly. This change has occurred on the basis of the increasing socialist consciousness of employees and engineering technicians. In 1953, when we started building the Han River Railway Bridge, the first time we used the new method of water jetting to sink 40 cm diameter pipe piles, the whole bureau went all out, but only one and a half piles (30 meters) could be sunk in a day, which did not meet the quota (40 meters per shift). When the Han River Highway Bridge was built in 1954, one shift reached 284 meters, exceeding the quota by more than seven times. For the Yangtze River Bridge, the diameter of the pipe columns increased to 155 cm. Initially, it took 7 days to sink one column, but eventually it became 4 columns a day, an efficiency increase of 27 times, which is also 4 times higher than we expected. The production of pipe columns increased from one section per day to four sections. The production of steel rings increased from one in two months to two in one month. Young interns who graduated last year can now take charge of the construction leadership of a bridge pier. Electric welder Guan Yeliang trained 4 apprentices to reach the level of third-grade workers or above within a year. An ordinary young person becomes a special technical worker such as a third-grade diver after short-term training. These changes are an important guarantee for the early completion of the Yangtze River Bridge.
    In terms of machinery, various important machines have been successfully trial-produced for experimental work and foundation construction in the past year. We are now manufacturing large rotary drilling rigs and 45-ton derrick floating cranes as high as 49 meters. In particular, we have also successfully trial-produced and improved the latest Soviet-style vibration pile drivers. This machine is extremely powerful, solves the problem of the speed of sinking pipe columns in the Yangtze River, guarantees the construction of the bridge, and plays an important role in the early completion of the Yangtze River Bridge.
    Factories across the country have given us full support, especially the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory, which guarantees to start supplying the first span of steel beams in July this year. This way, we can start installing steel beams in the third quarter of this year.
    Under the influence of various changes, the leadership of our engineering bureau has gradually overcome conservative thinking. When we saw that it was possible to start the construction of 6 bridge piers last year, we began to consider accelerating the construction progress of the entire bridge and formulate a new schedule. However, at that time, we still euphemistically called this schedule an "advanced struggle goal," put it in a drawer, and dared not announce it to the masses, and dared not mobilize the masses to strive for the early completion of the Yangtze River Bridge. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's report gave us a deep inspiration, making us realize that the leadership's thinking was far behind the reality. The facts have already revised the conservative plan. If we don't put forward a reasonable schedule for building the Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule to fully promote practical work, it is essentially a right-leaning conservative thought of "leaving a hand for insurance."
    Studying the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session made us realize this. Minister Teng Daiyuan gave us clear instructions when inspecting the work, approved the plan for building the Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule, and announced this plan to the masses. All the employees of the bureau are enthusiastically striving to improve the planned indicators and overcome various difficulties in order to realize this plan. Last year, in November and December, many good news of completing the plan ahead of schedule came from various construction sites. In 1955, the bureau overfulfilled the annual construction and installation plan by 109%.
    Of course, this does not mean that there will be no difficulties in the future, or that there will be few difficulties. On the contrary, there are still many difficulties waiting for us to overcome.
    Technically speaking, to increase the speed of pipe column drilling, we still need to further seek more appropriate tools and more reasonable technical operation procedures. To ensure the quality of underwater concrete in the drilled holes, measures must also be taken. Suspended cantilever installation of steel beams is still a new and massive task for us.
    In terms of work: Because of the past conservative thinking, the training of cadres and the growth of technical strength are far from keeping up with the needs of the development of the situation. Simultaneous construction of 8 bridge piers in the middle of the river was something we had not estimated in the past, so we were not prepared enough. The quality and quantity of technicians and workers need to be increased, otherwise it will be difficult to cope with the situation of mastering this comprehensive day and night work.
    With the acceleration of progress and the increase of tasks, the work of machinery, materials, and transportation must also be advanced or increased accordingly, and the supply work must be strengthened in a planned and coordinated manner.
    Our organizational work and construction management work are still very backward from the requirements of practical development. We must further strengthen plan management, financial management, and technical management on the existing basis, promote piece-rate wages and strengthen the technical responsibility system.
    The task of political and ideological work is arduous. Conservative thinking cannot be completely reversed at once, especially right-leaning conservative thinking is not only manifested in the formulation and completion of plans, but permeates all aspects of work. Encouraging the advanced and supporting new things is a regular task. On the other hand, with the continuous progress of work and the continuous emergence of new achievements, complacency will also grow, which is also a major enemy of completing tasks ahead of schedule and must be prevented at any time.
    In order to realize the plan of building the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule, aiming at several major key issues, we will resolutely and quickly break the conservative thinking of the personnel department, and cultivate, promote, and equip enough cadres, technicians, and skilled workers for the situation of simultaneous construction of 8 bridge piers. We will quickly manufacture large rotary drilling rigs, train drillers, and strengthen drilling work to shorten the drilling time, ensure that 3 bridge piers are completed this year, and strive to complete 5 bridge piers, so as to complete all the bridge piers before the flood season this year. We will prepare for steel beam installation work in advance: train sufficient steel beam riveting workers in the early stage, prepare tools, manufacture double-acting boom cranes, study and learn cantilever installation methods technically as early as possible, and assist the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory and Shenyang Bridge Factory to complete the manufacture of steel beams on time and ahead of schedule, so as to ensure that the steel beam installation of the first span on the left bank will begin in the third quarter of this year, complete one and a half spans this year, and work on three construction points simultaneously next year to install all the steel beams at an average speed of 60 tons per day. We must also organize the parallel operation of highway pavement work and steel beam installation in order to strive for the highway to be open to traffic closely following the railway, and build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge one year ahead of schedule.

    提前建成武汉长江大桥
    武汉长江大桥工程局局长　彭敏
    第一个五年计划中规定，新建铁路公路两用的武汉长江大桥，铁路部分1958年通车，公路部分1959年通车。能否按期完成或提前完成呢？从去年一年工作的情况来看，可以提前建成！
    为什么能提前建成呢？首先是情况变了。1954年以前，初步设计提出用压气沉箱法修建基础。用这种方法，一年里只能施工三个月，还需要大量的机械设备，特别是在高压空气中工作，工人的健康和生命没有保证。现在，根据苏联专家建议，采用“管柱钻孔法”修建基础。去年9月正式展开了江心墩台的全面施工。在施工中证明，用“管柱钻孔法”，完全有把握在今年初将长江大桥全部八个桥墩同时施工。这个情况就根本打破了一个枯水季节只能修两个3个桥墩的旧观念，加速了长江大桥的建设进程。我们的钢梁安装和基础工程也将采取部分平行作业。这样一来，修建长江大桥的时间就不是3年零4个月，而是大大缩短了。
    两年来，全局的技术力量在迅速成长，劳动生产率在迅速提高。这是在职工和工程技术人员的社会主义觉悟日益提高的基础上所发生的变化。1953年，我们开始修汉水铁桥的时候，第一次用射水沉桩的新方法下40公分直径的管桩，全局上下全力以赴，一天只能下一根半（30公尺），未达到定额（每班40公尺），1954年修汉水公路桥的时候，一班达到284公尺，超过了定额七倍多。在长江大桥所下的管柱直径增到155公分，开始是7天1根，最后是1天4根，效率提高了27倍，也比我们预计的提高4倍。管柱的制造从每天1节提高到4节。钢围令从两个月制造1个提高到1个月制造2个。去年毕业的青年实习生，现在可以担当一个桥墩的施工领导。电焊工管业良在一年的时间内带出4个达到三级工以上水平的徒弟。一个普通的青年经过短期训练后就成为三级潜水工这样特种技术工人。这些变化就是提前建成长江大桥的重要保证。
    在机械方面，一年来为试验工作和基础施工试制成功了各种重要的机器。我们现在正在制造大型旋转式钻机，制造高达49公尺的45吨德立克水上大吊机。特别是我们还试制成功并且改进了苏联最新式的震动打桩机。这种机器的威力极大，解决了在长江下沉管柱的速度问题，保证了大桥的施工，对提前建成长江大桥起了重要的作用。
    全国各地的工厂给我们以充分的支援，特别是山海关桥梁工厂保证于今年7月开始供应第一联钢梁。这样我们就可以在今年第三季度开始安装钢梁。
    在各种情况变化的影响下，我们工程局的领导也逐渐克服了保守思想。当我们看出在去年有可能开始6个桥墩的施工的时候，才开始考虑加速全桥建设进度，制定新的进度表。但是，我们当时还把这个进度表美其名曰“先进的奋斗目标”，放在抽屉里，不敢向群众宣布，不敢动员群众为提前建成长江大桥而奋斗。党的七届六中全会的决议和毛主席的报告，给我们很深的启发，使我们认识到领导思想落后于实际很远了。事实已经给保守的计划作了修正，我们再不把提前建成长江大桥的合理进度提出来，以全面推动实际工作，实质上就是“留一手保险”的右倾保守思想。
    学习六中全会文件使我们认识到这一点，滕代远部长在检查工作的时候又给了我们明确的指示，批准了提前建成长江大桥的计划，并且向群众公布了这个计划。全局职工都热情奋发地设法提高计划指标，克服种种困难，为实现这个计划而努力。去年在11、12月里，各工地都传出了许多提前完成计划的捷报。1955年，全局超额完成全年建筑安装计划109％。
    这当然不是说，今后已经没有困难了，或困难很少。相反，还有很多困难待我们克服。
    从技术上说，要提高管柱钻孔的速度，还需要进一步寻求更适当的机具，更合理的技术作业过程。要保证钻孔内水下混凝土的质量，还要采取措施。钢梁悬臂安装法架设对我们还是一项新的和巨量的工作。
    从工作上说：因为过去保守思想作祟，干部的培养和技术力量的增长还远赶不上形势发展的需要。江心8个桥墩同时施工是我们过去没有估计到的，因而准备不足，技术人员和工人在质量上和数量上都需要增强，否则，面对掌握这全面日夜工作的局面是困难的。
    随着进度的加快，任务的增加，在机具、材料、运输工作方面也要相应地提前或增加，必须有计划地相适应地加强供应工作。
    我们的组织工作，施工管理工作还十分落后于实际发展的要求，必须在现有的基础上，进一步加强计划管理、财务管理、技术管理，推行计件工资和加强技术责任制。
    政治思想工作任务是艰巨的。保守思想不是一下子就能彻底反掉的，特别是右倾保守思想不仅表现在计划的订制和完成上，而是渗透在各方面的工作中。鼓励先进，支持新鲜事物是一个经常的工作。另一方面，随着工作不断的前进，不断有新的成就，骄傲自满情绪也会滋长，这也是提前完成任务的大敌，必须随时防止。
    为实现提前建成武汉长江大桥的计划，针对几个主要的关键问题，我们将坚决地迅速地打破人事部门的保守思想，为8个桥墩同时施工的局面培养提拔配备足够的干部、技术人员和技工。将迅速制造大型的旋转式钻机，培养钻工，加强钻孔工作以缩短钻岩的时间，保证今年完成3个桥墩，争取完成5个桥墩，以期今年洪水期前桥墩全部完成。将提前准备钢梁安装工作：早期训练充足的钢梁拚铆工人，准备工具，制造双动臂的吊机，从技术上及早研究学习悬臂安装法，并协助山海关桥梁厂、沈阳桥梁厂按时和提前完成钢梁的制造工作，保证在今年三季度即开始左岸第一联的钢梁安设，今年完成一孔半，明年分三个工点齐头并进，以平均每日60吨的速度安装完全部的钢梁。还要组织公路路面工作和钢梁安装的平行作业，以争取公路紧跟着铁路通车，提前一年建成武汉长江大桥。
