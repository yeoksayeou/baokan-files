Vienna People Rally to Protest the Decision of the Austrian Government
    The Austrian police authorities' decision to prohibit the World Federation of Trade Unions from operating within Austria has aroused the indignation of the Austrian working people. On the evening of February 9, a mass protest meeting was held in Vienna. G. Pöschl, one of the oldest leaders of the Austrian workers' movement, spoke at the meeting. He said that Interior Minister Helmer's order to ban the World Federation of Trade Unions from operating in Austria violated the feelings of the Austrian working people.
    Otto Horn, a member of the Standing Committee of the Austrian Trade Union Federation, emphasized in his speech that this police action against the World Federation of Trade Unions was a challenge to the Austrian working class.
    The Central Committee of the Korean Professional Trade Union League sent a telegram to Austrian Federal Chancellor Raab on February 11, stating: "The Austrian Ministry of the Interior's prohibition of the World Federation of Trade Unions' activities violates the principle of neutrality declared by the Austrian government. We demand the immediate cancellation of this decision."
    The Central Council of Polish Trade Unions issued a statement protesting the Austrian government's decision on behalf of the Polish working class. The statement emphasized that the World Federation of Trade Unions is the largest and most representative organization of the working class worldwide, officially recognized by the United Nations, and its activities are in line with the goals of the United Nations Charter and the aspirations of the working people of all countries for better living conditions, freedom, and peace.
    The Presidium of the Hungarian Trade Union Council, in a letter to World Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Vittorio, expressed its heartfelt support for the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The letter said that the Hungarian working people were very indignant at the decision made by the Austrian Minister of the Interior based on inaccurate accusations. This tyrannical measure trampled on trade union and democratic rights and hindered the work of an organization recognized by the international labor movement and the United Nations.
    The Finnish Construction Workers' Union, representing 35,000 Finnish construction workers, sent a letter to the Austrian government strongly protesting the ban on the World Federation of Trade Unions operating on Austrian territory.
