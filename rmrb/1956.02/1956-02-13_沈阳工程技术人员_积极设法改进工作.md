Shenyang Engineering Technicians Actively Seek Ways to Improve Work

    Many engineering technicians in Shenyang are actively improving their work.

    In the past, the design personnel of the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory had to go through three steps regardless of what product they were designing. This time, when surveying and mapping a type of automatic reclosing "hammer mechanism," they reduced one step through careful calculation; at the same time, they strengthened the preparation work before surveying and mapping, and relied on experienced veteran workers to help measure dimensions, so that the design task, which was originally planned to be completed by the end of August, could be completed by the end of March. Pang Hongquan, a technician at the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, improved the bracket and other parts of the K-type water pump, reducing the weight of the water pump by two-thirds. The improved part of the water pump this year alone can save the country 400,000 yuan in wealth.

    Engineering and technical personnel also take the initiative to help workers learn technology and solve difficulties in production. Kong Qingrong, a technician at Shenyang General Machinery Factory, worked with workers to study and promote the rapid steelmaking method, which increased the number of furnaces for steelmaking every day.

    沈阳工程技术人员
    积极设法改进工作
    沈阳市许多工程技术人员积极改进工作。
    沈阳高压开关厂的设计人员过去不论设计什么产品，都要经过3个步骤。这次他们在测绘一种自动重合闸“重锤机构”的时候，经过精打细算，减少了一个步骤；同时，又加强了测绘前的准备工作和依靠有经验的老工人帮助量尺寸，使这个原计划8月底完成的设计任务，在3月底就可以完成。沈阳水泵厂技术员庞鸿泉改进了K型水泵的托架等部分，使水泵的重量减轻了三分之二，仅今年改进部分水泵即可为国家节约40万元的财富。
    工程技术人员还在工作中主动帮助工人学习技术，解决生产中的困难。沈阳通用机械厂技术员孔庆荣和工人一起研究推行快速炼钢法，增加了每天炼钢的炉数。（据新华社讯）
