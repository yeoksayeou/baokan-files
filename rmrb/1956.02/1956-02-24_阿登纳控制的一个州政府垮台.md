Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 23rd: A government in North Rhine-Westphalia state controlled by Adenauer collapsed on February 20th, according to Dusseldorf sources. This event is considered a serious blow to the Adenauer government.

On that day, the North Rhine-Westphalia state parliament passed a motion of no confidence in State Premier Arnold, ousting him from power. Arnold was Adenauer's main deputy. For nine years, he had held the position of state premier in North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany's most populous and industrialized state. This position has now been succeeded by the Social Democrat Steinhoff.

The motion of no confidence was jointly put forward by the Free Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party. The leaders of these two parties do not conceal that they put forward this motion of no confidence because they are dissatisfied with Adenauer's attempt to implement one-party rule in West Germany and his inflexible pro-American foreign policy.

Western news agencies believe that Adenauer's loss of control over the North Rhine-Westphalia state government may cause him to lose the two-thirds majority in the Federal Senate composed of state representatives, which would hinder the passage of West German rearmament legislation in the Senate. In addition, some predict that the existing contradictions within the alliance between Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democratic Party within the Bonn government will intensify.

On the evening of the day of the vote in the Dusseldorf state parliament, Adenauer delivered a speech in Bonn stating that his Christian Democratic Union would study whether it could continue to cooperate with the Free Democrats in the federal government.

    阿登纳控制的一个州政府垮台
    新华社柏林23日电　杜塞尔多夫消息：阿登纳的基督教民主联盟所控制的北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州政府在2月20日宣告垮台。这件事情被认为是对阿登纳政府的严重打击。
    北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州议会在这一天通过了一项对州总理阿诺德的不信任动议，把他赶下了台。阿诺德是阿登纳的主要副手。9年来，他一直在西德这个人口最多、工业最集中的北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州据有州总理的职位。现在，这个职位已经由社会民主党人史丹霍夫继任。
    不信任的动议是由自由民主党和社会民主党联合提出的。这两个党的领袖们并不隐讳他们提出这项不信任动议是由于：他们不满阿登纳想在西德实行一党统治的企图和他的毫不变通的亲美外交政策。
    西方国家的通讯社认为，阿登纳丧失对北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州政府的控制以后，可能使他失去在由各州代表组成的联邦参议院中的三分之二多数，这样就会阻碍在参议院中通过西德重新武装的立法。此外，也有人预测，波恩政府内部阿登纳的基督教民主联盟和自由民主党之间的联盟内部已经存在的矛盾将更加尖锐化。
    在杜塞尔多夫州议会投票的当天晚上，阿登纳在波恩发表演讲说：他的基督教民主联盟将要研究是否能够继续在联邦政府中同自由民主党人合作的问题。
