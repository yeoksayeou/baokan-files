The bugle call for a great march towards science has sounded
By Our Correspondent Zhou Huizhi

"Our people, especially intellectuals, have reached the time for a great march towards modern science."

"Strive to enable our country's most urgently needed scientific departments to approach the world's advanced level by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan."

Premier Zhou, in his political report at the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, resoundingly put forward this glorious and great task to the people of the whole country, especially the intellectuals. This is the call to launch a great march towards science. This will cause a large-scale upsurge in scientific and cultural construction, arriving at the same time as the high tide of economic construction in our country. This will rapidly change the backward face of our country and accelerate the realization of Chairman Mao’s great call—"We will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture."

In recent days, the scientists attending the Political Consultative Conference have been discussing and talking about this issue with extremely excited moods at any time and any place, and expressed their willingness to contribute all their knowledge and strength to achieve this great task. Their mood is understandable. The fact is: only in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party, only today when economic construction is developing rapidly, can their knowledge play a role. Committee member Wang You is an organic chemistry expert who has been engaged in the research of antibiotics since 1944, but there was no "place for him to use his skills" in the old society. With lingering resentment, he recounted the twists and turns he encountered: "I once worked in a small pharmaceutical factory. Capitalists only knew how to seek profit and disregarded people's health. Research work could not be carried out, and I had to leave the pharmaceutical factory, which once led to a period of living in poverty. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the director of the Kuomintang reactionary government's military medical department suddenly became interested in the research of antibiotics and allocated a large amount of funds, but most of this funding disappeared, and the actual annual funding used for research was only enough to buy dozens of pounds of alcohol." He continued excitedly: "After liberation, with the support of the people's government, great progress has been made in antibiotic research. More than a dozen institutions have been established across the country, with more than 100 people engaged in research work, and great achievements have been made. How can people like me who have had a hard time not feel extremely happy and joyful in the current situation!"

Committee member Qian Xuesen, who recently returned from the United States, recently visited the industrial construction in Northeast China and other places. During the visit, he met many classmates who were in the United States in the past, and they were all working hard in their respective posts. One of them was specializing in automobile manufacturing. When he returned to China around 1948, in the old China that only had automobile repair shops, the skills he had learned were completely useless. Now this classmate has served as the chief engineer of the auxiliary workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The rapid development of the motherland's socialist construction and the need for scientific and technological talents deeply moved him. He expressed that he would work harder to enable Chinese students who are still in the United States to return as soon as possible and participate in the construction of the motherland together.

How to catch up with the world's advanced level is also one of the main topics for scientists. They cited many encouraging facts to illustrate the possibility of catching up with the advanced level. Taking antibiotic research as an example, in the recent short period of two or three years, a series of research work has been carried out. Among them, the chemical structure and analysis of chlortetracycline and streptomycin, the antibacterial effect of antibiotics, the physiology of chlortetracycline, and the stereochemistry research of citrinin have all caught up with the world's advanced level. The acquisition of dihydrostreptose separation shows that we are not lagging behind the United States in this regard. Agricultural science has generally achieved considerable achievements. The successful research of using oil cake to prevent crop diseases is a huge contribution of the Chinese scientific community to mankind. Furthermore, regarding the problem of alternate bearing in fruit production, which the United States still considers to be an unsolvable problem, we have found a way to maintain the yield of "off-years" above the average level with the help of Soviet experts. This method has been successfully tested and is beginning to be promoted. The committee members also realized that such achievements are still a minority after all and cannot be complacent. To comprehensively catch up with the advanced level, the scientists who are standing at the forefront of the struggle must also seriously carry out self-transformation, give play to the spirit of collective research, vigorously cultivate new forces, and launch a vigorous general offensive.

Committee member Hou Defeng, who is a geologist with more than 30 years of experience, said that the reason why scientific research work progressed slowly in the past, in addition to the limitations of objective conditions at the time, scientists themselves also had many problems. They all worked in isolation, without cooperating with each other, and the path was very narrow. Even if there were some achievements, they could not be applied. He cited an example: "For example, some geologists pick up a stone, appreciate it themselves, and write an article. There is some truth in it, but it is fragmented and certainly will not have much effect on the national economy and people's livelihood." He believes that this style of being detached from reality and appreciating oneself must be completely changed. Committee member Zhou Shilu, who is the deputy director of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute and the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, was previously hindered in his research work due to too many administrative affairs and social activities. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, he decided to get rid of some administrative affairs, help his colleagues in the institute solve problems, so that everyone can play his due role; he himself must also personally study a work and contribute more strength to the people.

The committee members also criticized the old views and old methods in the aspect of cultivating talents. Some people still cherish the idea of ​​cultivating one or two "favorite disciples" in ten or twenty years, or still adopt the old training methods of not actively helping with research and improvement, and letting them grow on their own, which cannot meet the needs of current work. They believe that it is possible to train a talent who can work independently in three to five years. As long as everyone works hard, it is no problem to train one million senior intellectuals in twelve years.

The central government proposed that scientific workers should have six-fifths of their time spent on business activities, and decided to assign outstanding college students to scientific departments, which is even greater support and encouragement for them. When talking about these issues, they all expressed with full confidence that they would contribute all their energy to the cause of the people.

### 响起了向科学大进军的号角

    响起了向科学大进军的号角
    本报记者　周慧之
    “我国人民，首先是知识分子已经到了向现代科学大进军的时候。”
    “争取在第三个五年计划期末使我国最急需的科学部门能够接近世界先进水平。”
    周总理在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上所作的政治报告中，响亮地向全国人民特别是知识分子提出了这个光荣伟大的任务。这就是发起向科学大进军的号角。这将使我国随着经济建设高潮到来的同时，出现一个规模宏大的科学文化建设高潮，将迅速地改变着我国的落后面貌，将加快实现毛主席的伟大号召——“我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”。
    连日以来，出席政治协商会议的科学家们，随时随地都以极其兴奋的心情讨论着、交谈着这个问题，并表示要为实现这一伟大任务而贡献出所有的知识和力量。他们这种心情是可以理解的。事实正是这样：只有在共产党领导下的新中国里，只有在经济建设飞快发展的今天，他们的学识才能发挥作用。汪猷委员是一个有机化学专家，从1944年起就开始从事于抗生素的研究工作，但是旧社会里没有他的“用武之地”。他余愤未平地讲述他所遭遇的周折说：“我曾一度在一家小药厂内工作，资本家只知牟利，不顾人民健康，研究工作无法进行，后来不得不离开这个药厂，因而曾经有一个时期弄得生活无着。抗日战争结束后，国民党反动政府的军医署长忽然对抗生素的研究工作发生了兴趣，并拨出一大笔经费，但是这笔经费的绝大部分都不知去向，实际用在研究上的全年经费只够买几十磅火酒。”他接着很兴奋地说：“解放后，在人民政府支持下，抗生素研究工作已有了很大进展，全国现在建立了十几个机构、有一百多人在进行研究工作，并且得到了很大的成就。像我这样有过一番苦难经历的人，处在今天这样情况下，怎能不感到无比的欢欣和愉快呢！”
    刚从美国回来不久的钱学森委员，最近曾参观了东北等地的工业建设。参观中遇到很多过去在美国的同学，他们都在自己的岗位上努力地工作着。其中有一个同学是专门学习汽车制造的，1948年左右回国时，在那个只有汽车修理厂的旧中国里，他所学的本领根本无处使用。现在这位同学已经担任了第一汽车制造厂辅助车间的总工程师。祖国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展和对于科学技术人材的需要，使他深受感动，他表示要更加努力使尚在美国的中国留学生早日回来，一同参加祖国建设。
    如何赶上世界先进水平也是科学家们主要话题之一，他们举出很多令人鼓舞的事实说明赶上先进水平的可能性。拿抗生素研究工作来说，在最近很短的两三年时间里，已经进行了一系列的研究工作，其中金霉素、链霉素的化学结构和分析，抗生素制菌作用，金霉菌生理，橘霉素立体化学研究等都已赶上世界先进水平，双氢链糖分离的获得表明在这方面我们已不落后于美国。农业科学方面更是普遍地获得了相当成就，用油粕防止农作物病害的研究成功，是我国科学界对人类的巨大贡献。再如果树生产中的大小年问题，美国现在还认为是没法解决的问题，我们在苏联专家帮助下，已经有办法使“小年”产量也能保持在平均水平以上，这个办法已经试验成功，并开始推广。委员们也认识到：像这样的成就毕竟还是少数，不能自满，要全面赶上先进水平，站在斗争最前列的科学家们，还必须认真地进行自我改造，发挥集体研究的精神，大力培养新生力量，发起一个声势浩大的总进攻。
    侯德封委员是一个三十多年的老地质工作者，他说过去科学研究工作进展很慢的原因，除当时客观条件限制外，科学工作者本身也有很多问题。他们都是孤立地搞，互相不配合，而且路子很窄，即使有点成绩也无法运用。他举例说：“比如有些地质工作者，抓起一块石头，自己欣赏一番，写了一篇文章，道理是有些，但是零零碎碎，对国计民生当然不会有多大作用。”他认为这种脱离实际、孤芳自赏的作风必须彻底改变。周拾禄委员是华东农业科学研究所副所长兼江苏农林厅厅长，过去因行政事务和社会活动太多，妨碍了研究工作的进行。他听了周总理报告以后，决心要摆脱一些行政事务，帮助所内同志解决问题，使每人都发挥他应有的作用；自己也要亲手研究一项工作，对人民多贡献一些力量。
    委员们对于培养人材方面的老观点和老办法也进行了批判。有些人还留恋于十年二十年培养出一两个“得意门生”的想法，或者仍旧采用不积极帮助研究提高，听其自生自长的旧的培养办法，都不能适应目前工作的需要。他们认为三、五年培养出一个能单独工作的人材是可能的，只要大家努力，十二年内培养一百万高级知识分子是不成问题的。
    中央提出要让科学工作者有六分之五的时间用在业务活动上，并决定把优秀的大学生分配给科学部门，这对他们更是莫大的支持和鼓舞，谈到这些问题时，他们都信心百倍地表示要把全部精力贡献给人民的事业。
