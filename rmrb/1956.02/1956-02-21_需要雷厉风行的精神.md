    Need the Spirit of Swift and Decisive Action
    Kong Sang
    To adapt to the requirements of completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and to adapt to the high tide of the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses, the work of promoting advanced experiences and carrying out rationalization proposals needs to be carried out swiftly and on a large scale with the spirit of swift and decisive action.
    The practice of the Chengdu Municipal Construction Trade Union demonstrates this momentum. Starting in mid-January, they conducted inspections of the past work of promoting advanced experiences and rationalization proposals at construction sites and processing plants. While inspecting, they improved their methods, immediately organizing the promotion of advanced experiences that should have been promoted but were not. They seriously cleaned up rationalization proposals, immediately handling those that needed to be addressed, awarding prizes to those who had not received them, and explaining to the masses suggestions that could not be adopted for the time being, while also establishing and improving relevant institutions and responsibility systems. They organized and appraised advanced experiences that had been promoted and rationalization proposals that had been adopted and had promotional value, learning from each other's strengths, overcoming weaknesses, and comprehensively improving them to form a complete set of experiences. Then, based on the identified advanced experiences and project needs, they proposed promotion plans for the city, company, and construction sites, launching a promotion month for advanced experiences and rationalization proposals from late February to mid-March, using technical performances, amateur technical seminars, advanced experience training courses, teaching contracts, and other forms to earnestly promote advanced experiences. For key problems that could not be solved at present, they proposed topics, convening various professional seminars for engineering technicians and workers to solicit rationalization proposals. During this month, they required each employee to learn and apply one or two advanced experiences, eliminate blank spots in the promotion of advanced experiences, and quickly overcome backward areas, striving to completely break through the unified labor quota of 1955 in the first quarter. Finally, on this basis, the work of promoting advanced experiences and rationalization proposals will be made regular.
    Such momentum and such spirit are urgently needed at present. The Chongqing Municipal Construction Administrative Department should cooperate with and support the trade union to thoroughly complete this task. Trade unions in other regions should also learn from them. Promoting advanced experiences and carrying out rationalization proposals is something that must be done regularly and at all times. However, with the current high tide of socialist construction approaching, it is entirely necessary to vigorously, centrally clean up, rectify, and launch such an effort. Doing so will further inspire the masses' enthusiasm for innovation and will clear a smooth path for the unleashing of this creative spirit.

    需要雷厉风行的精神
    孔桑
    适应提前完成第一个五年计划的要求，适应广大群众社会主义积极性的高涨，对推广先进经验和开展合理化建议的工作，需要用雷厉风行的精神，迅速地大规模地开展。
    成都市建筑工会的做法表现了这种劲头。从一月中旬开始，他们在工地和加工厂对过去推广先进经验和合理化建议工作进行了检查。他们一边检查，一边改进，对应推广而未推广的先进经验立即组织推广；对合理化建议认真进行清理，该处理的立即处理，未给奖者给奖，一时不能采纳的建议即向群众交代，并建立与健全有关的机构和责任制度。对已推广的先进经验和已采纳的有推广价值的合理化建议，进行整理和鉴定，取长补短，综合提高，使之成为一套完整的经验。然后，根据已鉴定的先进经验和工程需要，提出全市、公司和工地的推广计划，在2月下旬到3月中旬开展一个推广先进经验和合理化建议征集月，通过技术表演和业余技术座谈会、先进经验训练班、教学合同等形式认真推广先进经验；对目前不能解决的关键问题，提出课题，召集工程技术人员和工人开各种专业座谈会，征集合理化建议。在这个月里，要求每个职工都能学会和运用一件到两件先进经验，消灭推广先进经验中的空白点和迅速克服落后部分，争取在第一季度内全部突破1955年统一劳动定额。最后，在这个基础上，使推广先进经验和合理化建议的工作经常化起来。
    这样的劲头，这样的精神，是目前迫切需要的。重庆市建筑行政部门应该配合、支持工会，彻底做好这件事。其他地区的工会也应该向他们学习。推广先进经验，开展合理化建议，这是一件经常要做、时刻要做的事情。但是，在目前社会主义建设高潮来临的时候，大张旗鼓地、集中地清理、整顿、发动一次，是完全必要的。这样做，将会进一步鼓舞群众的积极创造精神，并且会给这种创造精神的发挥扫开一条平坦的大道。
