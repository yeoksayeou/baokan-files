Chu Tunan's Speech

    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    In his political report, Chairman Zhou Enlai mentioned that "the brilliant achievements of socialist countries in construction and their consistent adherence to the policy of peaceful coexistence have won widespread welcome and support from peace-loving people in all countries around the world. The friendly relations between our socialist countries and all countries willing to maintain peace are also developing day by day." Our country's friendly activities and cultural exchange work with capitalist countries over the past year serve this policy and embody this spirit. Over the past year, our country has conducted friendly contacts and cultural exchanges with capitalist countries through various forms such as art, science, medicine and health, sports, education, translation and publishing, film, exhibitions, and information exchange, and has achieved important achievements in all aspects. This has played a certain role in expanding the influence of our country's peaceful diplomacy, striving to unite international friends, and expanding international peace forces. Especially in terms of artistic performances, whether in terms of quantity or effect, it has been the most prominent in the work of the past year. Our art troupes were invited to visit India, Burma, Indonesia, and Northern and Western Europe. Among them, the art troupes that visited Western and Northern Europe, because of the long duration of their visits, the large number of countries visited, and the fact that they were mostly the first time to visit these countries, were welcomed by the broad masses of people and received by the governments of these countries, thus enhancing mutual understanding between our country and the people of these countries, and providing a very good start for friendly contacts and cultural exchanges between peoples. In particular, the art troupe that went to Western Europe, although it also visited fraternal countries in Eastern Europe, mainly visited capitalist countries in Western Europe, which enabled our country to have contact with many countries in Western Europe that had not yet established diplomatic relations and enhanced friendship with the people of various countries, playing a pioneering role in international activities, and its influence was huge and far-reaching.
    The art troupe to Western Europe spent more than 8 months visiting 31 cities in 9 countries. The art troupe to Northern Europe (namely the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Troupe) spent three and a half months visiting 17 cities in 5 countries. Through visits to these countries, not only did they introduce Chinese classical drama and dance art to the people of European countries, but they also brought the friendship of the Chinese people to the people of European countries. Therefore, all the cities where the art troupe arrived were warmly welcomed by the local people without exception. Our art troupes generally perform in national theaters with the highest status and widespread influence in these countries. The warm welcome they received, according to foreign friends, was rare. Before the performance, there was a rush to buy tickets. In some cases, tickets were sold out two or three days in advance. In others, people got up before dawn to queue up to buy tickets. Some people bought one ticket together, some held small flags to solicit tickets, some came by car or plane from other places, and some theaters made an exception to sell standing tickets. In Western Europe, some people even bought tickets at 15 times the original price. At the end of the performance, it was common for the audience to applaud warmly, stomp their feet, stomp on the floor or stand up and cheer, or present flowers and give speeches, resulting in encores as many as twenty or thirty times. In addition, the art troupe and artists, cultural circles, and educators from various countries also frequently held seminars, gatherings, etc. to exchange views on culture and art and exchange work experience with each other, thus enhancing mutual understanding and friendship. The governments of various countries also provided the art troupe with varying degrees of support, assistance, and even solemn reception. Therefore, some newspapers in some countries believed that the visit of the Chinese art troupe was a major event in the cultural life of these countries. In the Danish press, someone even created a new term "yellow fever" to describe people's love for Chinese art and the warm welcome to Chinese artists. Of course, we will not forget their sincere friendship. We also know that the honor they gave is given to the Chinese people, the great creators of a long and rich culture and art.
    The people of European countries, especially the art circles in Europe, generally have a high evaluation of Chinese drama art. In the visits to the Nordic countries alone, we collected more than 250,000 words of commentary. Apart from a very small number of newspapers and artists who have different opinions, they generally have the following understanding of Chinese drama art:
    1. Chinese drama art is rich in people's nature and vitality because of its connection with the people and its combination with reality. Its rich imagination, its meticulous performance methods, its healthy sense of humor, its highly precise sense of rhythm, and its excellent martial arts make it a complete and unique art. They believe that this is "the art of smiling in life," full of rich vitality and optimism. As the famous French poet Claude Roy said, "The magnificent, joyful, and witty performances of the art troupe of the People's Republic of China can be said to be a national performance. Here, the history of the nation is depicted, the emotions of the nation are displayed, the character of the nation is expressed, and the elite of the nation is contained." Some newspapers also said that "the characteristic of Chinese classical drama lies in its true social realism. Through drama, people express their common and personal thoughts and feelings." "French Observer". Regarding our performance methods, such as the boat without a boat, the door without a door, the needle and thread without needle and thread, their newspapers said: "Our overwhelming feeling is: how infinite is the possibility of performing only with the imitation and movements of the human body!" "National Newspaper" of Norway. Regarding our martial arts, they even said: "Technique is to them like wings to a bird, and there is no heavy feeling at all. Even flipping two somersaults in the air is as clean and neat as laughing." "Gothenburg Trade and Shipping Daily" of Sweden.
    2. The comprehensiveness of Chinese drama art is that it highly integrates singing, dancing, pantomime, dialogue, martial arts, music, and art in creation to become a complete and unified whole, with its own emphasis, flexible changes, which makes people feel infinitely rich and also makes people feel infinitely perfect. As the Finnish newspapers say, Chinese classical opera "organically combines singing, music, dance, pantomime, martial arts, and dramatic dialogue. For Western audiences, it opens up a very fresh and exciting world in terms of artistic expression." "Helsinki News". In Denmark, there are also such comments: "Chinese drama typically expresses the combination of the reality of life and artistic imagery, which is unbelievable to us. The secret lies in: expressing reality with artistic means that have nothing to do with reality. According to most modern drama theorists, Chinese drama should be an independent art. It is connected with the people, tradition, and reality, and is a drama that is completely out of naturalism. The form is strict but full of imagination, stable, vivid, imagination, and reality. An art that retains the connection of dramatic forms. It does not limit time, but is tightly melted in time." "Social Democrat".
    3. Regarding the preservation and development of classical culture and art by the new China, it is believed that this is the new China's cultural policy, "being responsible for the past as well as for the future." In various countries, many people have written articles comparing the old Chinese drama stage with the new face of Chinese drama to see the innovation and development of Chinese drama art in the new China. They believe that "the new China has given ancient literature and art a revival" "Land and People's Daily" of Denmark; and that "Peking Opera was sent to Western countries for the first time, allowing people to see the ancient China that produced this wonderful form of drama, and also allowing people to see the new China that takes good care of and develops it" "Daily News" of Sweden. And the great comedian Chaplin provided proof based on his personal experience. After he rushed to Paris to see the performance of the art troupe, he said: "I visited China 30 years ago. I saw performances of the same repertoire, but the plot was lengthy and the content was mixed with jewels and dross. Now that I have seen this brand new performance, I can't say anything else, I can only say that this is the new China!"
    Therefore, through the art troupe's visits to various countries, not only did they introduce Chinese art, but also made the people of various countries understand the face of the new China through art, thus enhancing mutual understanding and friendship, and promoting cultural exchanges between our country and various countries. This undoubtedly makes a certain contribution to the lofty cause of promoting human peace and progress. Of course, the achievements are obtained on the one hand because of the revolutionary victory of the Chinese people, the brilliant achievements of our socialist construction, and the unprecedented improvement of our international status; on the other hand, the correctness of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy has enabled traditional culture and art to be developed and achieve great victories internationally. In the past, our understanding of this situation was not enough, and our estimates were insufficient. Therefore, our subjective efforts could not meet or adapt to the needs of objective reality. From the wide and far-reaching influence gained by the art troupe's visit and performance and the training and education we received in this work, I think all of us comrades engaged in cultural, artistic work and friendly activities should first deeply understand that developing international cultural exchanges is in line with the wishes of the people of all countries and is conducive to international cooperation and the cause of world peace; Secondly, we should also have a correct estimate and full understanding of China's position and role in international affairs, the contribution of Chinese national culture and traditional art to the world, and the influence it can have; Third, especially the comrades who participated in the work of the art troupe, should not be complacent because of this, but should strengthen their studies, work hard, and continuously improve our art, create and rehearse more and better new repertoires to meet the growing needs at home and abroad. If we can do this, I believe that we will be able to continue to carry forward our culture and art with a hundredfold confidence and actively and proactively carry out foreign friendly and cultural exchange work. This is beneficial and necessary for striving to continue to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace, and for safeguarding the rapid development of our country's socialist industrial construction and cultural construction.

    楚图南的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    周恩来主席的政治报告中曾经提到，“社会主义阵营各国在建设中所获得的辉煌成就和一贯坚持的和平共处政策，赢得了世界各国爱好和平人民的广泛欢迎和支持。我们社会主义国家同一切愿意保持和平的国家之间的友好关系，也日益发展”。我国一年来对资本主义各国的友好活动和文化交流工作，正是服务于这一政策，也体现了这种精神。一年来，我国通过艺术、科学、医药卫生、体育、教育、翻译出版、电影、展览会及资料交换等多种多样形式与资本主义各国进行友好接触和文化交流，在各方面都取得了重要成就。这对于扩大我国的和平外交的影响、争取团结国际友人和扩大国际和平力量，都起了一定的作用。尤以在艺术表演方面，无论从分量上、从效果上看，在一年来的工作中都显得最为突出。我国的艺术团体应邀访问了印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、北欧和西欧各国。就中以访问西欧和北欧的艺术团，因为经历的时间长，访问的国家多，且多是第一次到这些国家，受到了这些国家中的广大人民的欢迎和政府方面的接待，因而增进了我国与各国人民间的互相了解，使人民与人民之间的友好联系和文化交流，有了极为良好的开端。特别是到西欧的艺术团，虽然也曾访问了东欧的兄弟国家，但主要是西欧的资本主义国家，使我国与西欧许多未建交的国家开始有了接触和增进了与各国人民的友谊，在国际活动中起了开路先锋的作用，其影响是巨大的也是深远的。
    到西欧的艺术团，经过8个多月的时间，访问了9个国家的31个城市。到北欧的艺术团（即中国古典歌舞剧团），经过了三个半月的时间，访问了5个国家的17个城市。通过对这些国家的访问，不仅把中国的古典戏剧和歌舞艺术介绍给欧洲各国人民，也把中国人民的友谊带给了欧洲各国人民。因此，凡是艺术团所到达的城市，都毫无例外地受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。我国艺术团一般都是在这些国家中有最高地位和广泛影响的国家剧院演出。所受到的热烈欢迎，据外国的朋友们说是很少见的。演出前买票拥挤，有的在两三天前，戏票即已卖完，有的天未明即起来排队买票，有的两人合购一票，有的打着小旗子征购戏票，有的从外地乘车、乘飞机赶来，有的在戏院里破例卖站票，在西欧且有人以原票价15倍的高价购买戏票。在演出闭幕时，群众热烈鼓掌、顿足、跺地板或起立欢呼，或献花致词，以至于谢幕达二三十次之多，更是常事。此外艺术团与各国的艺术家、文化界、教育界人士亦经常举行座谈会、联欢会等，交换关于文化艺术的见解和交流彼此的工作经验，因而增进了彼此的相互了解和友谊。各国的政府也给与艺术团以各种程度不同的支持、协助，乃至于郑重的接待。所以有些国家的报纸，都以为中国艺术团的访问是这些国家中文化生活中的一件大事。在丹麦的报刊上甚至有人制造出一个新的名词“黄热”，来形容人们对于中国艺术的爱好和对于中国艺术家的热烈欢迎。当然我们是不会忘记他们这种诚挚的友谊的。我们也知道他们所给的荣誉，乃是给与悠久而丰富的文化和艺术的伟大的创造者中国人民的。
    欧洲各国人民，特别是欧洲的艺术界，对中国的戏剧艺术一般地都评价得很高。仅在北欧各国的访问中，我们即搜集了约25万字以上的评论文字。除了极少数的报纸和艺术家们有不同的意见外，一般地对于中国戏剧艺术有着下列的认识：
    一、中国的戏剧艺术由于它和人民的联系与现实结合，富有人民性和生命力。它的丰富的想像力、它的细致入微的表现方法，以及它的健康的幽默感、高度精确的节奏感和卓越的武功，使它成为一种完整的独特的艺术。他们认为这是“在生活中微笑的艺术”，充满了饱满的生活力和乐观情绪。这正如法国名诗人克劳德·罗阿所说的，“中华人民共和国艺术团的华丽、喜悦和机智的演出，可以说是一种全民的演出。在这里描绘了民族的历史，显示了民族的感情，表现了民族的性格，蕴藏了民族的精英。”一些报纸也说“中国古典戏剧的特点在于它的真正的社会现实性，通过戏剧，人民表达着他们的共同的和个人的思想和感情。”“法兰西观察家报”。对于我们的表现方法，如没有船的船，没有门的门，没有针线的针线，他们的报纸是这样说的：“我们压倒一切的感觉是：仅只以人的身体的模仿与动作来表演的可能性是多么的无穷无尽啊！”挪威“民族报”。对于我们的武功，他们甚至于这样说：“技术之于他们，犹如双翼之于小鸟，根本没有那种沈重的感觉。连在空中翻两个筋斗，也如同大笑一场一样的干净利落。”瑞典“哥德堡贸易海运日报”。
    二、中国戏剧艺术的综合性，在创作上高度的融合了歌唱、舞蹈、哑剧、道白、武功、音乐、美术各方面成为一种完整的统一的整体而又各有重点，灵活变化，使人既感到无限丰富，也使人感的到无限完美。这正如芬兰的报纸所说的中国古典歌剧“把歌唱、音乐、舞蹈、哑剧、武功和戏剧道白有机地结合在一起，对于西方观众来说它在艺术的表现方面打开了一个十分新鲜和动人心魄的天地”“赫尔辛基新闻”。在丹麦、也有着这样的评论：“中国戏剧典型地表现了对于我们说来是令人难以置信的生活的现实与艺术形象化的结合。秘决就在于：以和现实毫无关连的艺术手段来表现现实。根据大多数现代戏剧理论家的意见，中国戏剧应该是一种独立的艺术。它和人民和传统和现实有着联系，而是一种完全脱出自然主义的戏剧。形式严格但充满了想像力，稳静、生动、想像和现实。一种艺术，它保留了戏剧形式的联系。它不限定时间，却紧密熔化在时间里。”“社会民主党人报”。
    三、对于新中国保存和发扬了古典文化艺术，认为这是新中国的文化政策，“对过去负责也如同对将来一样的负责”。各国都有不少的人，著文以中国旧时戏剧舞台情况和新中国戏剧的新面貌的对比来看新中国戏剧艺术的革新和发展。他们认为“新中国赋予古老的文艺以复兴”丹麦“国土与人民报”；认为“京剧第一次送到了西方的国家，使人们看到产生这种绝妙的戏剧形式的古老的中国，也使人们看到了很好的照顾并发展它的新中国”瑞典“每日新闻”。而以自己亲身的体验作为证明的则是伟大的喜剧家卓别麟。他赶来巴黎看了艺术团的表演后，他说：“30年前我曾经到过中国，我看过同样的剧目的演出，但是情节冗长，内容混杂着珠宝和糟粕。现在看见了这种全新的演出，我不能说什么别的，我只能说这就是新中国！”
    所以，通过艺术团对于各国的访问，不仅是介绍了中国艺术，也通过艺术使各国人民认识新中国的面貌，因而增进了彼此的了解和友谊，并促进了我国与各国的文化交流。这对于促进人类和平进步的崇高事业，无疑地是有着一定的贡献的。当然，这些成就的获得，一方面是我国人民的革命胜利、我国社会主义建设事业的光辉成就和我国国际地位的空前提高；一方面是毛主席文艺方针的正确，使传统的文化艺术得到发扬并在国际上获得了伟大的胜利。而过去我们对于这种情形认识不够，也估计不足，因此我们的工作主观的努力总不能满足或不能适应客观实际的需要。从这次艺术团的访问演出所获得的广泛而深远的影响和我们在这次工作中所受到的锻炼和教育，我想我们所有从事于文化、艺术工作和友好活动的同志们，首先应该深切地了解发展国际间的文化交流，是符合各国人民的愿望和有利于国际合作和世界的和平事业；其次也应对于中国在国际事务中的地位和作用，对于中国民族文化和传统艺术对于世界的贡献和所能发生的影响，有着正确的估计和充分的认识；第三、特别是参加艺术团工作的同志们，不要因此骄傲自满，而是更要加强学习，努力工作，不断提高我们的艺术，创作和排演更多、更好的新剧目，来满足国内外日益增长的需要。能够这样，我相信，我们必能怀着百倍信心，继续发扬光大我国的文化、艺术并主动积极地来开展对外友好和文化交流工作。这对于争取继续和缓国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平，对于保卫我国社会主义工业建设、文化建设的迅速发展都是有益的，是必要的。
