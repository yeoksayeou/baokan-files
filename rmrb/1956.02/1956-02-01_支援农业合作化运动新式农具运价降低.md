    Xinhua News Agency report: To support the agricultural cooperation movement, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications have, from January 17th of this year, reduced freight rates for 50 categories and more than 80 types of new-style farm implements and agricultural machinery (excluding tractor-drawn implements) such as various types of double-furrow plows, single-furrow plows, seeders, semi-stationary steam engines, gas engines, and water pumps.

    The Ministry of Railways has determined that when either the consignee or the consignor is a supply and marketing cooperative or provides proof from a supply and marketing cooperative, the freight rates will be reduced by more than 30% when shipping disassembled or non-disassembled gas engines, diesel engines, rice threshers, and 18 other types of new-style farm implements and agricultural machinery (including parts and accessories). The Ministry of Communications has determined that for highway transportation departments when supply and marketing cooperatives entrust the organization of motor vehicle and horse-drawn carriage transportation of new-style farm implements, agricultural machinery, and their parts and accessories, in areas where freight rates are already classified by grade, the freight will be calculated according to the lowest grade; in areas where grade-based pricing has not been implemented, proposals for price reductions should also be submitted to the Provincial People's Committee for determination and implementation, and empty return fees should be reduced as much as possible.
