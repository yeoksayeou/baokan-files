    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) has successfully concluded, having passed the resolution on the summary report of the Central Committee of the CPSU. This resolution outlines the specific path for the Soviet Union to move towards communism, strengthens the highest principle of party leadership—collective leadership, and, after a profound analysis of the current international situation, formulates the Soviet Union's foreign policy guidelines for the coming months and years. The 20th Congress of the CPSU is not only a major event in the political life of the Soviet people, but will also have a significant and far-reaching impact on the international situation.

    The Congress adopted the directives for the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. This directive is a document of great historical and political significance, a great program for Soviet communist construction, and a new symbol of Soviet peace policy.

    The scale of the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan far exceeds that of previous five-year plans. This plan is adapted to the new stage of Soviet economic development. At present, the Soviet Union not only possesses a strong and comprehensive socialist production, but also possesses abundant material resources and more skilled cadres than ever before. In particular, the strong development of heavy industry enables the Soviet Union to rapidly develop the production of consumer goods while rapidly developing the production of the means of production. This fact convincingly demonstrates that the superiority of the socialist planned economy will inevitably ensure that the Soviet Union, in the shortest historical period, will catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita production.

    The Sixth Five-Year Plan vividly reflects the Marxist-Leninist general line consistently adhered to by the Soviet Communist Party of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. With the extensive use of science and technology and the substantial increase in labor productivity, the Soviet Union's industrial output will increase by 65% in the next five years, of which the production of means of production will increase by approximately 70% and the production of consumer goods will increase by approximately 60%. The Sixth Five-Year Plan also sets out important tasks for the rapid development of Soviet agriculture and animal husbandry. In these five years, the Soviet Union's agricultural output will increase by approximately 70%, and the total grain harvest will reach an annual output of 11 billion poods. Harvesting 11 billion poods of grain annually means that the Soviet Union can fully meet the growing needs of residents for grain.

    The 20th Congress of the CPSU showcased a beautiful vision of the future for mankind to the people of the world. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union's national income will increase by 60%, the real wages of workers and staff will increase by 30%, and the income of collective farm members will increase by at least 40%. The Congress also put forward some extremely important measures to further improve the people's living standards and working conditions, such as raising the wages of lower-paid workers, transitioning to a seven-hour work system, and thoroughly improving the pension system. In addition, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will also train a large number of specialized talents and vigorously develop education, science, and culture. All these measures will greatly improve the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people.

    A significant feature of the Sixth Five-Year Plan is that the Soviet Union will develop its eastern regions on a large scale. In the next five years, the total basic investment in the eastern regions will account for half of the national basic investment of the Soviet Union. Only the Soviet state can engage in construction on such a scale with such great courage. The completion of the new five-year plan will enable the economies and cultures of the various republics to achieve further prosperity and development.

    The Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan is not only a program for the Soviet Union's overall economic and cultural construction in the coming period, but also has significant international significance. It is known that continuously strengthening the cooperation of the socialist camp is an important factor in promoting the common economic upsurge of the countries in this camp. During the new five-year plan, the Soviet Union will do everything possible to further expand cooperation with people's democratic countries in order to rationally utilize production resources and production capacity through adjusting the development of various sectors of the national economy, specialization and collaboration of production, and exchange of scientific and technological achievements and advanced production experience. Every achievement made by the countries of the socialist camp in cooperation will strengthen the forces of world peace.

    The 20th Congress of the CPSU, based on the current international situation and the Leninist principle that two systems can coexist peacefully, formulated the Soviet Union's foreign policy guidelines for the coming months and years. All the reports, speeches, and documents of the Congress convincingly demonstrate that the Soviet Union is willing to strengthen cooperation and establish good relations with all countries—including the United States. War and peace are the issues of greatest concern to hundreds of millions of people around the world. The resolution of the Congress provided a comprehensive analysis of the current international situation, emphasizing the Marxist-Leninist principle: "As long as imperialism exists, the economic basis for the outbreak of war remains." However, the resolution also pointed out: "War is not fatally inevitable." Because "there is now such a powerful social and political force, which possesses important means to prevent imperialism from launching a war, and if the imperialists attempt to launch a war, this force will inflict a devastating counterattack on the aggressors and shatter their adventurous plans." This profound analysis of the international situation by the Congress is a great source of encouragement for peace-loving people around the world. Because the economic basis for the outbreak of war still exists, and because the reactionary groups of imperialism are still plotting new wars, people of all countries must be even more vigilant and unswervingly struggle to win further relaxation and stability of the international situation and peace.

    The 20th Congress of the CPSU shows that the Soviet people are filled with unparalleled and firm confidence and possess powerful strength in the peaceful competition of two different systems and in defending world peace. The comments of the bourgeois press have shown immense panic about this. They once considered the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan to be a "utopia." Today, they can no longer deny that the CPSU Congress is overflowing with exuberant optimism and cannot deny that the balance of power between the two world systems of socialism and capitalism has undergone fundamental changes. The American bourgeois political commentator Lippmann wrote: The socialist camp has "caught up with the West" in "the basic means of development"; the speeches at the Congress "are permeated with an extraordinarily confident tone."

    The convening of the 20th Congress of the CPSU is a historical event of world significance. This Congress creatively applied Marxism-Leninism, will guide the Soviet people to victoriously move towards communism, and will promote peace-loving people around the world to make further struggles to stop new wars. The Chinese people, who are engaged in socialist construction, will unite with the Soviet people and the people of all countries to work together and make new contributions to the noble cause of world peace and human progress.

### 苏共第二十次代表大会胜利闭幕

    苏共第二十次代表大会胜利闭幕
    苏共第二十次代表大会已经通过了关于苏联共产党中央委员会总结报告的决议，胜利闭幕。这个决议规划了苏联走向共产主义的具体道路，加强了党的领导的最高原则——集体领导，并且在对当前的国际局势作了深刻的分析之后，制定了苏联在未来年月中的对外政策方针。苏共第二十次代表大会不仅是苏联人民政治生活中的重大事件，并且将对国际局势发生重大的深远的影响。
    代表大会通过了发展国民经济的第六个五年计划的指示。这个指示是一个具有重大的历史和政治意义的文件，是苏联共产主义建设的伟大纲领和苏联和平政策的新的标志。
    苏联第六个五年计划的规模，远远超过以往的几个五年计划。这个计划是同苏联经济发展的新阶段相适应的。目前，苏联不仅拥有强大的全面发展的社会主义生产，而且拥有丰富的物质资源和比以往任何时期都要多的熟练干部。特别是重工业的强大发展，使苏联在迅速发展生产资料生产的同时，还可以迅速发展消费品的生产。这一事实令人信服地说明：社会主义计划经济的优越性必然能保证苏联在最短的历史时期，使生产量在按人口平均计算方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    第六个五年计划鲜明地反映了苏联共产党一贯坚持的优先发展重工业的马克思列宁主义的总路线。在广泛利用科学技术和大大提高劳动生产率的情况下，今后五年中的苏联工业产量将增加65％，其中生产资料的生产约增加70％，消费资料的生产约增加60％。第六个五年计划还规定了迅速发展苏联农业和畜牧业的重要任务。在这五年内，苏联的农业产量将增加约70％，谷物总收获量将达到年产110亿普特。每年收获110亿普特的谷物，这意味着苏联完全可以满足居民对粮食的日益增长的需要。
    苏共第二十次代表大会向全世界人民展示了人类未来的美好远景。在第六个五年计划期间，苏联的国民收入将增加60％，职工的实际工资将增加30％，集体农庄庄员的收入至少增加40％。代表大会还提出了关于进一步提高人民生活水平和改善劳动条件方面的一些极其重要的措施，如提高工资较低的工作人员的工资，过渡到七小时工作制，彻底改善养老金制度等。此外，在第六个五年计划期间，苏联还将大批培养专门人才，大力发展教育、科学和文化。所有这些措施都将大大提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平。
    第六个五年计划的一个巨大特点，是苏联将大规模地开发东部地区。在未来的五年中，东部地区的基本投资总额，将占苏联全国的基本投资的一半。只有苏维埃国家，才能以如此巨大的魄力，来从事这样规模的建设。新的五年计划的完成，将使各加盟共和国经济和文化获得进一步的繁荣和发展。
    苏联第六个五年计划不仅是苏联今后一个时期整个经济和文化建设的纲领，而且具有重大的国际意义。人们知道，不断加强社会主义阵营的合作，是促进这个阵营各国经济共同高涨的重要因素。在新的五年计划期间，苏联将尽一切可能进一步扩大同人民民主国家的合作，以便通过调整国民经济各部门的发展、生产的专业化和协作、交换科学技术成就和先进生产经验等，来合理地利用生产资源和生产能力。社会主义阵营各国在合作中所获得的每一成就，都会加强世界和平力量。
    苏共第二十次代表大会根据当前的国际局势，根据两种制度可以和平共处的列宁主义的原理，制定了苏联在未来年月中的外交方针。大会所有的报告、发言和文件都令人信服地表明：苏联愿意同一切国家——包括美国在内——加强合作，建立良好关系。战争与和平是全世界千千万万的人民最为关心的问题。代表大会的决议对当前的国际形势作了全面的分析，强调了马克思列宁主义的原理：“只要存在着帝国主义，爆发战争的经济基础也就保持着。”但是，决议同时指出：“战争的注定的不可避免性是没有的。”因为“现在有着这样一种强大的社会力量和政治力量，这种力量拥有重要的手段来阻止帝国主义发动战争，而如果帝国主义者企图发动战争，这种力量就会给侵略者以歼灭性的反击，粉碎他们的冒险计划。”代表大会对于国际局势这种深刻的分析，对于全世界爱好和平的人士是巨大的鼓舞力量。由于爆发战争的经济基础仍然存在，由于帝国主义反动集团还正在策划新的战争，因此，各国人民必须加倍提高警惕，坚持不渝地为争取国际局势的进一步和缓和稳定的和平而斗争。
  苏共第二十次代表大会，表明苏联人民对于两个不同制度的和平竞赛和保卫世界和平，充满着无比坚定的信心，拥有着强大的力量。资产阶级报纸的评论对此表现无比的惊慌。他们曾经认为苏联的第一个五年计划是“乌托邦”。今天，他们已不能不承认在苏共代表大会上洋溢着充沛的乐观精神，不能不承认社会主义和资本主义两个世界体系的力量对比已经起了根本的变化。美国的资产阶级政论家李普曼写道：社会主义阵营已在“基本发展的手段方面”“赶上西方”；大会上的发言“贯穿着异常充满信心的语气。”
    苏共第二十次代表大会的召开，是具有世界意义的历史事件。这个大会创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，将引导苏联人民胜利地走向共产主义，并且推动全世界爱好和平的人士为制止新战争而作进一步的斗争。正在进行社会主义建设的中国人民，将同苏联人民和各国人民团结一致，共同努力，为世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业作出新的贡献。
