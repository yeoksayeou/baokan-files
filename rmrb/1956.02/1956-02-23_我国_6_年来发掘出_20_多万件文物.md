China's archaeological work is developing rapidly. In the past 6 years, a total of more than 219,200 cultural relics have been unearthed from ancient tombs and ancient cultural sites in various provinces and cities (more than 1 million scattered pottery shards, etc., are not included in the calculation, nor are those without investigation reports).

    In 1953, during the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, fossilized human skull remains from the Late Paleolithic period were discovered in Huangshan Creek, Ziyang County, Sichuan Province. This is an important material for studying the problem of the Chinese ape-man. In the spring of 1954, more than 2,000 chipped stone tools were collected from a Paleolithic site discovered in Dingcun Village, Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province. After preliminary investigation and research, it was confirmed that this site is a very important Paleolithic site outside of Zhoukoudian and the Ordos Loop.

    Even more Paleolithic sites have been discovered in large numbers. Sites from this era can be found almost everywhere in the Yellow River basin. What is known now is more than a hundred times the number before liberation.

    The Zhengzhou site is the largest and most important discovery among the Yin Dynasty sites since liberation. The excavation of this site further clarified the relationship between the Longshan culture and the Shang Dynasty culture. Here, the discovery of the remains of bone and bronze ware manufacturing workshops illustrates the rapid development of productivity in the Yin and Shang Dynasties.

    The Anshan Taoguantun Jin Yuan Village site, discovered relatively complete remains, making it the most meaningful material for studying the lives of northeastern farmers from the 12th to 14th centuries. The relics of a Han Dynasty female chieftain's tomb unearthed in Jinning County, Yunnan Province, the Neolithic relics unearthed in Pan County, Guizhou Province, and many discoveries in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region all prove that in very ancient times, the cultures of ethnic minorities, like the Han culture, also developed brilliantly.

    Through these discoveries, extremely important and rich materials have been provided for the study of the material and cultural history, history, art, and science of our country through the ages.

    我国6年来发掘出20多万件文物
    我国考古事业正迅速地发展着。6年以来从各省、市的古墓葬、古文化遗址里所获得的出土物，共计219，200多件（零星的陶片等100多万件没有计算在内，没有附调查报告的也未计算在内）。
    1953年在成渝铁路工程中，在四川资阳县黄鳝溪发现了旧石器时代晚期的人头骨化石，这是研究中国原人问题的重要材料。1954年春，在山西襄汾县丁村发现的一处旧石器时代遗址，采获打制石器2，000多件，经过初步调查研究，肯定这个遗址是周口店和河套以外的一个非常重要的旧石器遗址。
    新石器时代的遗址更有大量的发现。在黄河流域几乎到处都可以发现这个时代的遗址。现在所知道的，就已经超过解放以前的数字百倍以上。
    郑州遗址是解放以来殷代遗址中最大而且是最重要的发现。通过这个遗址的发掘，进一步明确了龙山文化同商代文化的关系。在这里，由于骨器、铜器等制作工场遗址的发现，说明殷商时代的生产力已突飞猛进地发展。
    鞍山陶官屯金元村落遗址，发现了比较完整的遗存，成为研究12世纪到14世纪东北农民生活最有意义的材料。在云南晋宁县出土的汉代一个女土司墓的遗物，贵州盘县等地出土的新石器时代的遗物，以及在新疆维吾尔自治区、内蒙古自治区的许多发现，都证明在很古老的时候，少数民族文化也像汉族文化一样光辉地发展着。
    通过这些发现，对我国历代的物质文化史和历史、艺术、科学的研究，提供了极为重要和丰富的材料。
