Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I fully agree with and support the political report made by Chairman Zhou Enlai at this meeting, and the reports made by Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Dong Biwu, and Committee Member Chen Boda at this meeting.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, starting from the summer of last year, the socialist revolution in our great motherland has unfolded on an extremely broad scale and with extreme depth. It will be basically completed nationwide in about three more years, and the method used is a peaceful one. This is unprecedented and of great international significance. In recent years, internationally, our country, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, has established and developed diplomatic relations with any country. It strives for the noble goals of world peace and human progress, further expanding the peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, encouraging the development of the national independence struggles of the oppressed countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, isolating and weakening the imperialist aggressive blocs, striving for a peaceful international environment needed for our country's construction, and safeguarding the socialist cause of the motherland. Currently, it is striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, the complete unification of the motherland, and for continuing to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace. This is also unprecedented and of great international significance. All of this fully proves that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao has correctly applied the principles of Marxism-Leninism in combination with China's actual conditions. As long as the people of the whole country follow the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, diligently exert their wisdom and labor, and strive to do their jobs well, they will certainly be able to build our great motherland into a modern, highly cultured, prosperous, and powerful socialist industrial power in a not-too-long period of time. For all these achieved and certain achievements, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have formulated a comprehensive plan for carrying out China's socialist revolution by peaceful means, and at the same time pointed out: "In order to achieve this great goal, what determines everything is to have cadres, to have a sufficient number of excellent scientific and technical experts; at the same time, it is necessary to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, and unite all forces that can be united." At this CPPCC meeting, we also listened to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and read his report "On the Question of Intellectuals" made at the meeting on the question of intellectuals convened by the Party Central Committee. It made an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the current Chinese intellectuals’ problem and made a series of effective measures to "strengthen leadership, overcome shortcomings, and give full play to the existing intellectuals’ strength, constantly improve their political consciousness, cultivate new forces on a large scale to expand their ranks, and improve their professional level as quickly as possible to meet the country's ever-growing needs for intellectuals." From these instructions and reports, we can see that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has given high evaluations of the contributions of Chinese intellectuals in the national construction cause and the progress in ideological remoulding in the past six years since the founding of the country, and made sufficient and even extremely high estimates of the continuous progress that intellectuals may have in the socialist revolution in the future and the increasingly important role that may be played in the revolutionary cause. It called on the whole Party to attach more importance to intellectuals in the future, giving them full preferential treatment in life and convenience in work. More importantly, it provides assistance in politics and business, so that they can gradually improve themselves according to the country’s ever-growing needs and contribute all their labor and wisdom to the motherland and the people. Such deep and comprehensive care has never been received by Chinese intellectuals throughout history, which is a great encouragement to intellectuals across the country today.

As everyone knows, Chinese intellectuals in history have generally been tools to help the "rulers" suppress the working people, but many have also made contributions to the country and the people. In the past hundred years, imperialist aggression has stimulated their patriotic ideas, and some intellectuals have made some unforgettable achievements. Intellectuals account for a certain number of the many unnamed heroes commemorated by the People's Heroes Monument to be completed in front of Tiananmen Square. Nurtured by the long history and fertile land, certain intellectuals of all generations have learned from the people and summarized the experience of people’s labor, accumulating Chinese culture, so that some aspects of Chinese culture can still enjoy a world status today. Even in the darkest days before liberation, when the country was reduced to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, in addition to a large number of intellectuals who dedicated themselves to the revolution, there were still many people who refused to go with the flow, and made some achievements in academics in an environment of hunger and cold. This shows that Chinese intellectuals have one side that is accustomed to being tools of the "rulers," but also have a glorious historical tradition.

After the liberation of the whole country, intellectuals changed from being tools that could only be "rulers" in the past to being masters of the country together with the people of the whole country. This earth-shaking change has placed demands on Chinese intellectuals in terms of thought and work, especially senior intellectuals, who were not able to adapt to it all at once. As a result, there are distinctions among intellectuals: advanced, intermediate, backward, anti-revolutionary, and other bad elements. In the past few years, with the help of the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, the vast majority of them have carried forward their excellent historical traditions and made progress to varying degrees. Take Comrade Jin Yuelin, a member of our China Democratic League, as an example. He was originally a professor of idealistic philosophy. In the past few years, through the leadership of the Party, the help of the League, and his own continuous transformation efforts, he has become a professor who can initially master the weapon of Marxism-Leninism and criticize Dewey and Hu Shi's idealistic philosophy. And he is still continuing to delve into Marxism-Leninism, and it can be foreseen that he will have further achievements. There are many similar comrades in the Democratic League organization. It is very clear that the face of Chinese intellectual circles is undergoing fundamental changes under the leadership of the Party.

Especially after the country entered a climax of socialist revolution recently, the changes in the socio-economic structure have more powerfully shaken the sensitive intellectuals. Seeing the Party’s meeting on the question of intellectuals and the decision to give them deep and comprehensive care, taking the senior intellectuals who participated in this CPPCC meeting as an example, it can be seen that many people have such determination: In order to adapt to the current new situation and meet the climax of cultural construction that will follow the surging socialist economic construction climax, we must step up our efforts to transform ourselves into completely socialist intellectuals and resolutely become red experts who fight for socialism.

Indeed, this generation of Chinese intellectuals is extremely fortunate to have encountered a great era that our predecessors could never have encountered! The great socialist construction cause led by the Party has given us an extremely broad development prospect. In addition to giving us deep care, the Party is also further strengthening its leadership over us. We should be jubilant and encouraged. At the same time, we should also make deep reflections on how to work hard in practice to meet the expectations of the Party and the people!

Before the Party convened the meeting on the question of intellectuals, in order to deeply understand the situation of senior intellectuals, the China Democratic League carried out a series of liaison work, reflecting to the Party the representative opinions and demands of the cultural and educational circles. In Chairman Zhou Enlai's report, we saw that all the correct opinions and reasonable demands were resolved. What moved us even more was that the report also contained inspections and criticisms of the Party's work on intellectuals. In response to the Party's call, and in order to improve our own thinking and work, can our intellectuals not seriously conduct self-examination and criticism? In the third paragraph of Chairman Zhou's report on the question of intellectuals, he pointed out the following various errors of intellectuals: (1) They do not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, between the Chinese people and imperialism; (2) They are not satisfied with the policies and measures of the Party and the People's Government, and are nostalgic for capitalism and even feudalism; (3) They oppose the Soviet Union and are unwilling to learn from the Soviet Union; (4) They refuse to study Marxism-Leninism and slander Marxism-Leninism; (5) They despise labor, despise the working people, despise cadres from the working people, and are unwilling to approach workers, peasants, and worker-peasant cadres; (6) They are unwilling to see the growth of new forces, and think that progressive elements are speculators; (7) They not only often create disputes and opposition between intellectuals and the Party, but also create disputes and opposition among intellectuals; (8) They are conceited and think that they are the best in the world, and cannot accept the leadership of anyone or the criticism of anyone; (9) They deny the interests of the people and the interests of society, and look at all issues from the perspective of personal interests, and agree with what is in their own interests and oppose what is not in their own interests. It also tells us that there are very few people who have all nine kinds of mistakes, but there are not few people who have one or several kinds of mistakes. There are still many progressive elements who commit the problems of narrow-mindedness, arrogance, and looking at problems from the perspective of personal interests. Naturally, I and many comrades are among them, so I think this paragraph is the best mirror for us to conduct self-examination and criticism. It can clearly show our problems and help us transform ourselves.

We should also realize that the contributions that the Party and the people currently expect intellectuals to make to the rapidly developing socialist construction, whether from the perspective of quantity or quality, cannot be completely satisfied by even the best efforts of our national intellectuals, because our country's intellectuals are originally small in number and weak in quality, and the tasks they face are such arduous tasks. We must immediately put down all ideological burdens and catch up quickly; cooperate with one heart and one mind, and tap all potential; at the same time, we must vigorously cultivate new forces, in order to make more, greater, and better achievements. Therefore, I think what we intellectuals need to test ourselves most at present is whether we can truly prove in our work practice that we are "everything for socialism." Although we now know that only in socialist construction can we have infinitely broad prospects, we have become a part of the working class, and we are also dedicating ourselves to the socialist revolution, but in actual struggle, when encountering difficulties, will the bourgeois idealism and even the feudalism of the landlord class that remain in us still take the opportunity to expand? If we cannot use the determination of a brave man to break his wrist to resolutely fight against all external and internal non-socialist factors and win victory, we cannot truly achieve the goal of "everything for socialism" that we have established, we cannot truly and firmly become working-class intellectuals, and we cannot truly and firmly consolidate the alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. From my personal experience, this is an acute class struggle. I am an intellectual who grew up in the old society, and I have taken many tortuous roads in politics and ideology. I deeply realize that it is easy to make demands on others, but it is not easy to make demands on oneself; it is not difficult to put forward subjective wishes, but it is very difficult to turn subjective wishes into practical actions.

From the perspective of the entire situation of the development of China's socialist revolution, intellectuals will be easier to pass the socialist test than capitalist industrialists and businessmen, but if we do not go through a arduous self-transformation struggle process and eliminate non-socialist ideas, the contribution to the country and the people will be greatly reduced. Of course, ideological transformation is a long-term task, and can only gradually advance under active leadership assistance, and patient waiting for self-awareness. I personally have the following three experiences about what to do for self-transformation, and I would like to ask everyone for correction:

(1) We intellectuals must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party in the future, and accept the leadership of the Party wholeheartedly. The Party is the core force leading the Chinese revolution. Not only in politics, but also in scientific and cultural construction work, without the leadership of the Party, it is easy to lose direction and lose the driving force. We should also put forward any opinions we have in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything. Relying on the Party is the only way to achieve victory.

(2) We intellectuals must more systematically study Marxism-Leninism in the future, and carry out free discussions and criticisms on academic ideas. This can gradually help us establish the revolutionary outlook on life of the working class and the scientific world outlook, so that we can gradually overcome the ideological style of individualism and liberalism in our practical work, and enable us to make greater contributions day by day on the socialist cultural revolution front.

(3) We intellectuals must go deep into the revolutionary practice in the future, and often go to factories and rural areas to learn from workers and peasants, and work and live with them. This makes it easier to achieve the effectiveness of improving ourselves and improving our work from practice, and overcome our intellectuals’ problems of being divorced from reality and the masses. At the same time, if we often work and live with workers and peasants, we will generate a common language, consciousness, and feelings, and we will gradually eliminate the old problems and old consciousness that history has brought us, such as "mental workers rule people," "scholars are the head of the four classes of people," and "being fond of being a teacher."

I know that these three points are all clichés, and they are three things that we often mention and hear, but I think they are necessary keys for us intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals who grew up in the old society, to carry out ideological transformation and play a major role in the socialist revolution. We sincerely hope that intellectuals across the country will regard these three things as the goals of their future efforts, and check and encourage each other!

The Party's plan for transforming intellectuals is to make the progressive elements who actively strive for socialism and accept the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism account for more than three-quarters of the senior intellectuals by 1962, and to reduce the backward elements to about 5%. This required numerical indicator is correct, which makes our democratic parties and people's organizations feel very excited and very difficult. The democratic parties are the assistants of the Party. The Party's program for transforming Chinese intellectuals is just as Chairman Zhou Enlai said in his report on the question of intellectuals: "In general, to thoroughly eliminate the anti-revolutionary elements hidden in the intellectual circles, to reduce the backward elements to the lowest limit, to make the intermediate elements become progressive elements as much as possible, and to make the progressive elements become completely socialist intellectuals - this is the program of our struggle to continue to transform intellectuals at the present stage." Therefore, our democratic parties and people's organizations will carry out historical work in accordance with this correct program in the future."

Vice Chairman Guo Moruo believes in his report at this meeting that the collective education of democratic parties and groups has more, greater, and faster effects than personal exploration. He called on all democratic parties and people's organizations to further cooperate and jointly promote the ideological transformation of intellectuals. Our China Democratic League expresses its complete agreement and is willing to make its greatest efforts together with the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and other brotherly democratic parties. At the same time, we believe that Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's analysis of the three parts of intellectuals, progressive, intermediate, and backward, is completely correct. The so-called progress, intermediate, and backward are only some differences in the proportion of progressive and backward factors in thinking, and there are progressive factors in all of them. Promoting progress, continuing to move forward, and encouraging intermediate and backward elements to work hard on self-transformation, so that progressive, intermediate, and backward elements advance together, is the task of our democratic parties and people's organizations. We must do everything in our power under the leadership of the Party to complete this glorious historical mission!

Finally, I want to shout:

Chinese intellectuals closely unite with workers and peasants and strive to complete the socialist revolution quickly under the leadership of the Party!

Long live the great Chinese Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!

    章伯钧的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    周恩来主席在这次会议上所作的政治报告和李济深副主席、郭沫若副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武副主席和陈伯达委员在这次会议上所作的报告，我完全同意和拥护。
    在中国共产党、毛主席领导下，从去年夏季开始，我们伟大祖国的社会主义革命就以极广阔的规模和极深刻的程度展开，大约再有三年就可以在全国范围内基本上完成，而且所使用的方法是和平的方法，这是史无前例的、具有重大国际意义的。几年来，在国际间，我国根据平等互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则，同任何国家建立和发展外交关系的政策，为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力，进一步扩大了以苏联为首的和平民主力量，鼓舞了亚、非、中近东被压迫国家人民争取民族独立斗争的发展，孤立、削弱了帝国主义侵略集团，争取了我们建设祖国所需要的和平国际环境，保卫了祖国的社会主义事业，目前并正在为争取和平解放台湾，实现祖国的完全统一和为继续缓和国际紧张局势、巩固世界和平而奋斗，这也是史无前例的，并具有重大国际意义的。这一切，充分地证明了中国共产党、毛主席的领导是正确地运用了马克思列宁主义原则结合了中国的实际。全国人民只要跟着中国共产党、毛主席，勤恳地发挥自己的智慧和劳动能力，努力作好岗位工作，就一定能够在不太长的时间内，把我们的伟大祖国建设成为一个现代化的、有高度文化的、富强的、社会主义的工业大国。为了这一切已取得的和一定将会取得的辉煌胜利，我们向中国共产党、毛主席致以衷心的感谢。
    中国共产党、毛主席制定了用和平方法进行中国社会主义革命的全面规划，同时指出：“为了实现这个伟大的目标，决定一切的是要有干部，要有数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家；同时，要继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量。”在这次政协会议里，我们又听了周恩来主席的政治报告，读了他在党中央召开的关于知识分子问题会议上所作的“关于知识分子问题”的报告，对于当前的中国知识分子问题作了深入、全面的分析，作出了对知识分子“加强领导，克服缺点，采取一系列有效的措施，最充分地动员和发挥现有的知识分子的力量，不断地提高他们的政治觉悟，大规模地培养新生力量来扩大他们的队伍，并且尽可能迅速地提高他们的业务水平，以适应国家对于知识分子的不断增长的需要”的指示。从这些指示和报告中我们可以看出来中国共产党中央对建国六年来中国知识分子在国家建设事业中的贡献和在思想改造上的进步都作了很高的评价，对今后知识分子在社会主义革命中所可能有的不断的进步和对革命事业可能起的日益重大的作用，也作了足够的甚至是极高的估计，并号召全党今后要更加重视知识分子，给他们以充分的生活上的优待和工作上的便利。更重要的是在政治上、业务上给以帮助，使他们能够依照国家不断增长的需要逐步提高自己，为祖国和人民贡献出他们的全部劳动和智慧。这样深切而全面的关怀，是中国历代知识分子从来没有得到过的，这对今日全国的知识分子是极大的鼓舞。
    大家都知道，中国的知识分子在历史上一般多是帮助“治人者”压制劳动人民的工具，但也有不少对国家人民是有过贡献的。近百年来，帝国主义的侵略激发了他们的爱国主义思想，若干知识分子曾作出过一些令人难忘的事业。天安门前行将落成的人民英雄纪念碑所纪念的许多无名英雄中，知识分子就占有一定的数量。在悠长的历史和丰沃的国土教养哺育下，历代的某些知识分子向人民学习并总结人民劳动的经验，积累了中国的文化，使中国文化的某些方面，在今天仍能享有世界地位，就是在解放前国家沦为半封建半殖民地的最黑暗日子里，在大批献身革命的知识分子外，仍有不少人不肯同流合污，并在饥寒交迫的环境中，在学术上作出了一些成绩。这说明中国知识分子有惯作“治人者”的工具的一面，但也具有优良的光荣的历史传统。
    全国解放之后，知识分子从历代只能是“治人者”的工具的地位和全国人民一道变成了国家的主人。这一翻天复地的改变，在思想上、工作上对中国知识分子所提出来的要求，他们，尤其是高级知识分
  子，一时并不是都能够适应的。因而知识分子中就产生了先进、中间、落后和反革命及其他坏分子的区别。几年来，在党的
  团结、教育、改造知识分子政策帮助下，他们中间的绝大部分都发扬了优良的历史传统，有了不同程度的进步。举我们中国民主同盟的成员金岳霖同志为例吧。他本是一个唯心主义的哲学教授，这几年来，经过党的领导、盟的帮助，和自我不断的改造努力，他已经成为初步能掌握马克思列宁主义武器，批判杜威、胡适的唯心主义哲学的教授了。并且他仍在继续深入钻研马克思列宁主义，可以预见到他还会有更进一步的成就。在民盟组织中，类似的同志还有很多。中国知识界的面貌在党的领导下，已在发生根本变化，这是很显然的事。
    尤其是，在最近国家进入社会主义革命高潮之后，社会经济结构的变革，更有力地震动了富于敏感的知识分子。再看到这次党召开的关于知识分子问题会议，对他们所作的深切而又全面的关怀的决定，以我们这次参加政协会议的高级知识分子为例，就可以看出来，有很多人就抱有这样的决心：为了适应当前的新形势，迎接将随着汹涌澎湃的社会主义经济建设高潮而来的文化建设高潮，要加紧把自己改造成为完全社会主义的知识分子和坚决成为社会主义奋斗的红色专家。
    的确，我们中国这一代的知识分子是极幸运地遇到了我们的先辈从无可能遇到的伟大时代！党领导的伟大社会主义建设事业，给了我们以极宏阔的发展前途，党还极周到地在给我们以深切的关怀外，进一步地对我们加强领导，我们应欢欣鼓舞，但是同时，我们更应当作深刻反省，怎样在工作实践中努力，才能满足党和人民对我们的期望！
    在党召开关于知识分子问题的会议之前，为了深入了解高级知识分子的情况，中国民主同盟作了一系列的串联工作，向党反映了文教界有代表性的意见和要求。在这次周恩来主席的报告中，我们看到所有的正确意见和合理要求都得到了解决，更叫我们感动的是报告中还有关于党对知识分子工作的检查、批评。为了响应党的号召，为了提高自己的思想和工作，我们知识分子还能不认真进行自我检查和批评吗？周主席关于知识分子问题的报告第三段中，指出了知识分子有如下的各种错误：（1）他们在共产党和国民党之间、中国人民和帝国主义之间不分敌我；（2）他们不满意党和人民政府的政策和措施，留恋资本主义甚至留恋封建主义；（3）他们反对苏联，不愿意学习苏联；（4）他们拒绝学习马克思列宁主义，并且诋毁马克思列宁主义；（5）他们轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民，轻视劳动人民出身的干部，不愿意同工人农民和工农干部接近；（6）他们不愿意看见新生力量的生长，认为进步分子是投机；（7）他们不但常常在知识分子和党之间制造纠纷和对立，而且也在知识分子中间制造纠纷和对立；（8）他们妄自尊大，自以为天下第一，不能够接受任何人的领导和任何人的批评；（9）他们否认人民的利益、社会的利益，看一切问题都从个人的利益出发，合乎自己利益的就赞成，不合乎自己利益的就反对。并且告诉我们9种错误一应俱全的人是很少数，但有一种或几种错误的就不是很少数。犯有胸怀狭窄，高傲自大看问题从个人利益出发毛病的，在进步分子中也还不少。这里面自然也有我和不少的同志在内，所以我想这一段话就是我们进行自我检查批评的一面最好的镜子，可以清晰地照出我们的毛病，帮助我们改造。
    我们还应当认识，党和人民目前期望知识分子对急速发展中的社会主义建设所作的贡献，不论是从数量或是质量来看，都是我们全国知识分子即使竭尽全力也不能完全满足的，因为我国知识分子本来就是数量少，质量弱，而面临的任务，又是这样艰巨的任务。我们必须立即放下一切思想包袱，急起直追；同心合作，发掘一切潜力；同时还要大力培养新生力量，才能做出来更多、更大、更好的建树。因此，我认为我们知识分子目前首先要考验自己的，就是我们是不是真能在工作实践中证明我们是“一切为了社会主义”。尽管我们现在已知道只有在社会主义建设中才有我们无限广阔的前途，我们已经成为工人阶级的一部分，而且也在献身社会主义革命，但在实际斗争中，遇到困难时，我们身上残存着的资产阶级的唯心主义甚至地主阶级的封建主义等等非社会主义思想，是不是还要趁隙扩张？如果我们不能用壮士断腕的决心坚决的与一切外在和内在的非社会主义因素进行战斗，并取得胜利，我们就不可能真正达成所树立的“一切为了社会主义”的目的，就不能真正牢固地变成工人阶级知识分子，就不能真正牢固地巩固工人、农民、知识分子联盟。就我个人亲身的体验来看，这就是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。我是一个在旧社会中生长起来的知识分子，在政治上、思想上走过不少弯曲的道路。我深切地体会到对人家提出要求很容易，对自己提出要求却不容易；提出主观的愿望并不难，要把主观愿望变成实际行动却很难。
    从中国社会主义革命发展的整个形势来看，知识分子过社会主义这一关比资本主义工商业者是会更容易的，但是我们如果不经过艰苦自我改造斗争过程，清除非社会主义思想，对国家人民的贡献，就要大打折扣。当然思想改造是长期的工作，也只能在积极的领导帮助下，和耐心地等待自觉下，逐步前进。我个人对自我改造要做的事有以下三点体会，谨提请大家指正：
    （一）我们知识分子今后一定要更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，全心全意接受党的领导。党是领导中国革命的核心力量，不只在政治上，就是科学文化建设工作上，没有党的领导，就容易迷失方向，失掉推动力量。我们有什么意见，也应本知无不言，言无不尽的精神和盘托出。一切倚靠党，才能取得胜利。
    （二）我们知识分子今后一定要更系统的学习马克思列宁主义，并展开学术思想上的自由讨论和批判。这样可以逐步地帮助我们确立工人阶级的革命人生观和科学的世界观，使我们在实际工作中逐渐地克服个人主义、自由主义的思想作风，使我们在社会主义文化革命战线上，能够一天比一天有更大的贡献。
    （三）我们知识分子今后一定要深入革命实际，经常到工厂、农村中向工人、农民学习，和他们在一起工作、一起生活，这样才易于收到提高自己和从实际中改进工作的成效，克服我们知识分子脱离实际和脱离群众的毛病。同时，如果经常地和工人、农民工作、生活在一起，那就会产生共同的语言、意识、感情，就会把历史上带给我们的所谓“劳心者治人”、“士为四民之首”和“好为人师”的老毛病、旧意识逐渐清洗掉。
    我知道，这三点都是老生常谈，是我们经常提到和听到的三件事，但我想它们却是我们知识分子，特别是在旧社会中生长起来的高级知识分子，进行思想改造和在社会主义革命事业中起重大作用所必需的钥匙。我们诚恳地希望全国知识分子把这三件事情当作今后努力的目标，互相检查、互相督励！
    党所订的改造知识分子计划是到1962年使积极为社会主义奋斗，并接受马克思列宁主义基本观点的进步分子在高级知识分子中占到四分之三以上，使落后分子降到5％左右。这个要求的数字指标是正确的，使我们民主党派和人民团体感到非常兴奋，非常艰巨。民主党派是党的助手，党对中国知识分子进行的改造纲领正如周恩来主席在关于知识分子问题报告中所说：“总起来说，彻底肃清暗藏在知识界中的反革命分子，使落后分子减少到最低限度，使中间分子尽可能地变为进步分子，使进步分子成为完全社会主义的知识分子——这就是我们在目前阶段继续改造知识分子的斗争纲领”。因此，我们民主党派和人民团体在今后就要依据这个正确的纲领去进行历史性的工作。”
    郭沫若副主席在这次会议上所作的报告中，认为民主党派和团体的集体教育比个人摸索的效果更多、更大、更快。号召各民主党派、各人民团体更进一步地通力合作，共同推动知识分子的思想改造。我们中国民主同盟表示完全同意并愿在中国共产党、毛主席领导下和其他兄弟民主党派一起作最大的努力。我们同时认为郭沫若副主席对知识分子中的进步、中间、落后三部分的分析是完全正确的。所谓进步、中间、落后也只是思想中的进步、落后因素比重上有些差别，都有进步的因素存在。推动进步，继续前进，鼓励中间、落后分子努力自我改造，使进步、中间、落后一齐前进，正是我们民主党派人民团体的任务。我们一定要在党的领导下竭尽一切力量来完成这个光荣的历史任务！
    最后我要高呼：
    中国知识分子与工人、农民密切结合，在党的领导下为迅速完成社会主义革命而奋斗！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
