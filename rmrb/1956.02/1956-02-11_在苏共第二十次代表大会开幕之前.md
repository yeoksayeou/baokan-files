    Before the Opening of the 20th Congress of the CPSU
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    The 20th Congress of the CPSU is almost here. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people have now completed the preparations for this historically significant congress.
    In recent months, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has held, from the bottom up, party congresses at the grassroots level, party conferences in districts, cities, states, and border regions, and congresses of the Communist Parties of various union republics. These meetings brought into play the high degree of activism of party members, conducted extensive criticism and self-criticism, summarized the work of the party, re-elected leading bodies of the party at all levels, and elected delegates to the Party Congress. These meetings reflected the democratic life within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the benefits it brings, the unprecedented unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the determination of all party members to mobilize the people with all their strength to realize the grand Sixth Five-Year Plan. The recent 8th Congress of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan unanimously endorsed the unprecedented speed of economic development for the Kazakh Republic stipulated in the draft of the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan. Kazakhstan's total industrial output in 1955 was already more than four times that of the pre-war period, and in 1960 it will be 2.2 times that of 1955, which is even higher than the national industrial development speed of the Soviet Union. The same is true for agricultural development. Grain production in Kazakhstan, which has become one of the Soviet Union's granaries, will be five times that of 1955 in 1960, and cotton will be 2.3 times. During discussions of the draft plan, the delegates put forward many specific suggestions for better utilizing the republic's resources and potential.
    Delegates elected from various regions to attend the Party Congress are successively departing for Moscow. The 12th Party Conference of the Moscow Oblast recently elected Comrades Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Saburov, Suslov, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Aristov, Belyaev, Pospelov, and Shepilov as delegates to the 20th Congress of the CPSU.
    The enthusiastic competition of Soviet workers to welcome the CPSU Congress has yielded brilliant results. Many factories in Leningrad completed their January plans one week to ten days ahead of schedule. The competition between the Molotov Automobile Plant in Gorky and the Stalin Automobile Plant in Moscow has been going on for four months. The Molotov Automobile Plant fulfilled the competition conditions ahead of schedule, and in four months overproduced products worth 144.4 million rubles; workers put forward 6,500 rationalization proposals, of which about 4,000 have been adopted.
    The movement to strive for great development in production, inspired by the new magnificent Five-Year Plan proposed by the CPSU, is reaching its peak with the arrival of the CPSU Congress. Workers in entire regions and entire sectors of the national economy are launching large-scale competitions across the country.
    The competition to complete the 1956 plan ahead of schedule, initiated by workers from a large number of industrial and transportation enterprises in Moscow and the Moscow Oblast, quickly received a response from workers in thousands of enterprises in Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, and other industrial centers in the Soviet Union. The great significance of the labor competition in these industrial centers can be seen from the guarantees made by the workers in Moscow and the Oblast. The 1956 production and product plan of this large industrial center is enormous; they want to complete it by December 20th and overproduce 100,000 tons of coal, 190,000 tons of peat, 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than 15,000 tons of steel and steel products, 1,800 cars, 200 buses, 500,000 ball bearings, 10,000 sewing machines, 24,000 tons of mineral fertilizers, 800 tons of dyes, 7.2 million meters of cotton fabrics, 750,000 meters of woolen fabrics, and 450,000 pairs of leather shoes. They want to save 950 million rubles from reducing costs and adopting rationalization proposals, and also save 9,000 tons of metal, 186,000 tons of fuel, and 300 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.
    The oil workers of the Bashkir Autonomous Republic launched a competition among oil workers throughout the Soviet Union to complete the 1956 plan ahead of schedule. They decided to complete the plans for oil and gas extraction, as well as drilling and refining, ahead of schedule, and to produce an additional 200,000 tons of oil this year. The initiative of the workers in this major oil-producing area is spreading to Baku, the "Second Baku," and other oil-producing areas in the Soviet Union.
    Agricultural workers have not lagged behind industrial workers. Collective farmers, machine tractor stations, and state farm workers in the Voronezh Oblast issued a resounding call to agricultural workers throughout the Soviet Union: strive to fulfill the five-year production increase targets in the shortest possible time. Agricultural workers in the Voronezh Oblast increased grain production by one time, sugar beets and sunflowers by about two times, and milk by about half a time in 1955 compared to 1954. They continued to explore potential strengths, and after mass discussions and detailed planning, decided to increase meat production by one time within one year, and milk production by one time within one and a half years, instead of five years. They raised 187,500 pigs last year and will increase that to 689,000 this year. Many regions immediately rose up to support this initiative. Many oblasts in the Soviet Union are now holding meetings of advanced agricultural workers to study all the possibilities for developing production. The Altai Krai Agricultural Advanced Workers Conference discussed this initiative and decided that the Altai would produce 140 million poods more grain in 1956 than in 1954, and produce 660,000 tons of milk, 120,000 tons of meat, 78,000 quintals of wool, and 100 million eggs. Agricultural workers in the Ryazan Oblast guaranteed that they would bring the production of livestock products to the level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1960 within one year.
    Cultural and artistic workers in Moscow are also dedicating their labor products—new books, new paintings, new sculptures, new songs, new theatrical programs—to the 20th Congress of the CPSU. During the Party Congress, 17 new dramas, operas, and ballet performances will be staged in various theaters in Moscow. Many new feature films and documentaries will be screened in cinemas. Gorky's masterpiece "Mother" will also appear on the screen.

    在苏共第二十次代表大会开幕之前
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    苏共第二十次代表大会转眼就到了。现在，苏联共产党和苏联人民已经完成了这次有历史意义的代表大会的准备工作。
    苏联共产党最近几个月来从下而上逐级举行了基层组织党员大会，区、市、州和边疆的党代表会议，各个加盟共和国共产党代表大会。这些会议发挥了党员的高度积极性，进行了广泛的批评和自我批评，总结了党的工作，改选了地方各级党的领导机构，选举了出席党代表大会的代表。这些会议反映了苏联共产党的党内民主生活和它带来的好处，反映了苏联共产党队伍的空前团结一致，反映了全体党员用一切力量带动人民实现宏伟的第六个五年计划的决心。最近举行的哈萨克斯坦共产党第八次代表大会一致拥护苏联第六个五年计划草案中规定的哈萨克共和国经济发展的空前速度。哈萨克斯坦在1955年工业总产值已经为战前的四倍多，在1960年将为1955年的二点二倍，这比苏联全国工业发展速度还要高。农业发展速度也是这样。成为苏联谷仓之一的哈萨克斯坦谷物产量在1960年将为1955年的五倍，棉花将为二点三倍。代表们在讨论计划草案时提出了许多更好地利用共和国资源和潜力的具体建议。
    各地选举出来的参加党代表大会的代表陆续向莫斯科出发。莫斯科州第十二次党代表会议日前选举了布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、阿里斯托夫、柏里雅耶夫、波斯伯洛夫、谢皮洛夫等同志为参加苏共第二十次代表大会的代表。
    苏联劳动者迎接苏共代表大会的热烈竞赛已经结出灿烂的果实。列宁格勒许多工厂提前一周到一旬完成了1月份计划。高尔基市莫洛托夫汽车制造厂和莫斯科市斯大林汽车制造厂之间的竞赛已经进行了4个月。莫洛托夫汽车制造厂先期实现了竞赛条件，在4个月中超额增产了相当于14，440万卢布价值的产品；职工们提出了6，500件合理化建议，其中约4，000件已被采用。
    为苏共提出的新的宏伟五年计划所鼓舞起来的争取生产大发展的运动，随着苏共代表大会的到来，正走向高峰。整个地区、整个国民经济部门的劳动者纷纷向全国发动声势浩大的竞赛。
    由莫斯科市和莫斯科州大批工业和运输企业的劳动者发起的争取提前完成1956年计划的竞赛，迅速地得到列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克和苏联其他工业中心的几千个企业劳动者的响应。这些工业中心的劳动竞赛的巨大意义，从莫斯科市和州劳动者所作的保证便可以知道。这个大工业中心的1956年产量和产品计划是巨大的，他们要在12月20日完成它，还要超计划多产10万吨煤、19万吨泥炭、1亿度电力、15，000多吨钢和钢材、1，800辆汽车、200辆公共汽车、50万件滚珠轴承、10，000台缝纫机、24，000吨矿质肥料、800吨染料、720万公尺棉织品、75万公尺毛织品、45万双皮鞋。他们要从降低成本和采用合理化建议两项上节约95，000万卢布，还要节约9千吨金属、18.6万吨燃料和3亿度电力。
    巴什基尔自治共和国的石油职工向全苏联石油职工发动争取提前完成1956年计划的竞赛。他们决定提前完成开采石油和煤气以及凿井和炼油的计划，要在今年多产20万吨石油。这个大石油产区劳动者的创议，向巴库、“第二巴库”和苏联其他石油产区传播着。
    农业劳动者没有落在工业劳动者后面。伏龙涅什州集体农庄庄员和机器拖拉机站、国营农场的职工向全苏联农业劳动者发出响亮的号召：争取在最短期间实现5年的增产任务。伏龙涅什州的农业劳动者在1955年曾比1954年增产谷物一倍，甜菜和向日葵约二倍，牛奶约半倍。他们继续发掘潜在力量，经过群众讨论和详细规划，决定不是在5年而是在1年以内把肉类产量提高一倍，在1年半以内把牛奶产量提高一倍。他们去年养的猪为187，500头，今年要增加到689，000头。许多地区立刻起来支持这个创举。现在苏联许多州都在举行农业先进工作人员会议，研究发展生产的一切可能性。阿尔泰边疆农业先进工作人员会议讨论了这个创举，决定阿尔泰在1956年要比1954年增产14，000万普特谷物，要产66万吨牛奶、12万吨肉类、78，000公担羊毛和1亿个鸡蛋。梁赞州农业劳动者保证在一年以内使畜产品的生产达到五年计划所规定的1960年的水平。
    莫斯科的文化艺术工作者也以自己的劳动产品——新书、新画、新塑像、新歌曲、新的戏剧节目——献给苏共第二十次代表大会。在党代表大会期间，将有17个新的话剧、歌剧、巴蕾剧在莫斯科各个戏院上演。在电影院将放映许多新的故事片和纪录片。高尔基的名作“母亲”也将出现在银幕上。
