Comrades! In these days of the 20th Party Congress, the hearts of all Soviet people are filled with pride for our great motherland, for the victorious completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and for our country's entry into a new period of strong development in all sectors of the national economy. Not only are our foreign friends convinced that the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be fulfilled and even overfulfilled, but even our most vile and arrogant enemies admit that we have the strength to shoulder the tasks set forth in this grand plan.

The feasibility of completing this plan is guaranteed not only by our country's growing and powerful material and technical base and our industrial might, but also by the unparalleled growth of the Soviet people in the political and cultural spheres. The people of our cities and villages have learned to master modern technology and are adept at applying scientific achievements. It should also be added that, thanks to the great concern of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, our country has cultivated a large number of Party and Soviet leading cadres, economic work cadres, and ideological front workers who are capable of solving tasks of unprecedented scale. Things that were technically impossible even a year ago can now be done very successfully.

By the time of the 20th Congress, the Party had become even more closely united around the Party Central Committee.

We warmly support the Central Committee's highly principled defense of Marxist-Leninist theory against all kinds of distortions. We unanimously agree to strengthen the Central Committee's strict requirements for the work of Party and Soviet organizations in the states, border regions, and republics. We are extremely pleased to note that thorough adherence to the principle of collective leadership, increased regular concern for local Party organs, and the Central Committee's study of the most important issues in the development of the national economy have all yielded positive results.

Thanks to the wise leadership of the Leninist Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, our country has achieved great success not only in domestic policy but also in foreign policy. The peace-loving policy has further enhanced the Soviet Union's international prestige and increased the love of all progressive humanity for our Party and the Soviet government. Under the leadership of the Leninist Central Committee, we will march towards new victories in communist construction. (Applause)

The excellent resolution of the nationalities question is one of the greatest achievements of our Party. The Soviet national republics and states, after completely and permanently eliminating their past economic and cultural backwardness, are now highly developed and increasingly prosperous republics and states. The Soviet national republics and states are republics and states with large-scale industries equipped with modern advanced technology, multi-sector collective farms and state farms, and vast networks of higher and secondary schools and scientific institutions. In these republics and states, the culture, literature, and art of national form and socialist content are constantly developing.

In recent years, the national pride and Soviet patriotism of the people of all nationalities in our vast motherland have grown even more. The people of all republics and states in the Soviet Union regard contributing daily to the common cause of communist construction in our country as their patriotic duty and national honor.

The great Russian people have played a huge role in the prosperity of the Soviet national republics and states.

All nationalities will forever be grateful to the great Russian people for their tremendous help in their economic and cultural development. (Applause) The implementation of the Communist Party's nationality policy has further consolidated the friendship between the nationalities of our country, uniting them in a unified and unbreakable great family.

The brilliant resolution of our country's nationalities question pleases all progressive humanity. The victory of the nationality policy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an inspiring example for the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries. At the same time, this victory has aroused frantic resentment and instinctive fear in the imperialist camp. The reactionary groups in imperialist countries are desperately trying to minimize the achievements of the Soviet national republics in economic and cultural development. They stop at nothing in this disreputable conspiracy, even to the point of distorting the truth and engaging in outright slander.

Two years ago, a blatant reactionary, Olaf Caroe, published a book in London with the eye-catching and provocative title: "Soviet Empire." The reactionary groups stirred up an unbelievable uproar around this book, almost touting it as the most detailed and reliable work on Soviet Central Asia. However, Olaf Caroe had never been to Central Asia. His "scientific research" was based on the vile lies of those traitors to the motherland who had previously fled the Soviet Union.

The historical part of the book is completely untenable nonsense. The author refers to the despicable bourgeois nationalists, the anti-revolutionary bandit leaders during the Central Asian civil war, and all sorts of bandits who served in the Hitler army as national heroes. Olaf Caroe even sheds crocodile tears for the fact that the patriarchal way of life has not been eliminated in the Central Asian and Kazakhstan republics.

The book is filled with slanderous fabrications against the Russian people, the people of all nationalities in Central Asia and Kazakhstan, and especially the Soviet national intellectuals. The author does not even spare the Russian women who married Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkmens, and Kyrgyz. He accuses Russian women of marrying representatives of other nationalities with the aim of oppressing and controlling them. (Laughter)

This slanderer is so reckless that he even says that many famous activists in the Central Asian and Kazakhstan republics were suppressed for some kind of "anti-Party activities." For example, he said that Comrade Satpayev, the President of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh Republic, was "missing." However, Comrade Satpayev is working safely in his original position and is a delegate to this congress. Caroe also said that Comrade Abdurakhmanov, the former Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Uzbekistan, had "disappeared." But everyone knows that Comrade Abdurakhmanov is still alive and well and has been serving in an important position in the Uzbek Republic after graduating from the Advanced Party School.

Obviously, these imperialist gentlemen are resorting to such clearly despicable and stupid slanders not because they are living well. What can be done? Let them bark! We have a proverb in the East: "Although bats don't like sunlight, the sun doesn't stop shining because of it." (Applause)

We Soviet people have long known that the imperialist gentlemen, especially the American and British gentlemen, are good at reversing black and white, or, as our Ukrainian brothers say, can "turn a piglet into a crucian carp." Therefore, I would like to mention the "Joint Declaration of the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom" published not long ago. Some of the statements in this document can only make people indignant and laugh. If we talk about tyranny and oppression, then the drafters of the declaration have completely gone to the wrong place. Tyranny and oppression are easy to find in the places ruled by the American and British imperialists and their accomplices.

Portugal is one of the countries in the so-called "free world." Not long ago, the bourgeois journalist John Hatch, who personally visited Africa, said about Portugal's actions in the Portuguese colonies in Africa: "There is not even a trace of development towards political freedom or self-determination... One of the worst phenomena in Portuguese Africa is forced labor. Every healthy adult male in Mozambique is forced to work for six months a year..." Hatch said: "This is not exactly, but it is close to a form of slavery."

As everyone knows, Northern Nigeria is a British colony with a population exceeding the total population of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. John Hatch said when talking about Northern Nigeria that the people here not only live in extreme poverty but are also exceptionally uncultured. In describing Cameroon and its French part, he pointed out that 75% of the indigenous people there suffer from syphilis, and there is only one doctor for every 70,000 people.

John Hatch, in summarizing his impressions of visiting the Union of South Africa, concluded: The rule of this country is based on terror, fanaticism, and bigotry. "The white minority refuses to grant the most basic rights to the representatives of other races numbering nearly 10 million."

This is not "red propaganda," this is the testimony of a bourgeois journalist. This is the result of the rule of imperialism.

Comrade Khrushchev was right to say at the mass meeting in Bombay: "We are living through the spring of mankind, at this time the colonial slave system is collapsing, the old situation is gone forever." Now no slander, no fabrication can help the imperialists to keep the people in colonial slavery.

No matter how the imperialist gentlemen slander, victory will belong to the people of all countries who sincerely hope to establish true peace and happiness on earth. The powerful socialist camp is invincible. There is no doubt that this camp will grow stronger day by day, and the people of all countries who are closely united in this great camp and give each other fraternal help and support will continue to advance along the road of communist construction.

The people of all countries in the world, including the people of Eastern countries, understand the actual situation in our country. The unprecedentedly warm reception given to Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev in India, Burma, and Afghanistan particularly illustrates this point. These receptions have turned into a magnificent demonstration of the friendship between the people of Eastern countries and the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. The enthusiastic speeches made by many foreign delegations who have visited the Soviet national republics in the past two or three years also illustrate this point.

Comrades! In the current international environment, interest abroad in our motherland, in the lives of the Soviet people, is greater than ever before, and every true word about our country and from our country is valued as never before. This obliges us to raise ideological work, especially newspaper propaganda and radio broadcasting, to a higher level.

Today, Comrades Suslov and Mikoyan are absolutely correct in their criticism of the shortcomings in ideological work. In fact, not to mention the newspapers of the republics and states, even in the central newspapers and magazines, propaganda articles are often written detached from life. Many of them are identical to each other. The authors often repeat generalized formulas, afraid to say anything new, and the level of our radio propaganda is also not high. I think this situation must be improved immediately.

I would also like to say a few words about our literature. Of course, it would be incorrect not to see the tremendous work that our Party has done in developing literature. However, it would also be wrong to turn a blind eye to the fact that the development of literature still lags behind the development of the economy and the growing spiritual needs of the Soviet people. Our literature has not fully revealed to the world the greatness of the cause of the Soviet people.

We are pleased that a young and talented team is participating in literary work. The representatives of the older generation of writers have written many excellent works. But the people are still puzzled by the passive attitude of some famous language artists in their creative work.

The Soviet people have universal love, respect, and concern for writers, and have created good creative conditions for them, but sometimes this love is not reciprocated. In recent years, some of our great writers have not written anything for the people, and some of them have been the tail of events. It is no wonder that some people say that our country is moving forward by plane, while some writers are chasing behind in carts.

Perhaps it is just me, but I always feel that the enthusiasm that workers in the industrial and agricultural sectors have is not yet felt in some workers on the cultural front.

Comrades! Not long ago, the 10th Congress of the Communist Party of Tajikistan was held. The congress noted with great satisfaction that our republic has made remarkable achievements in the development of industry and agriculture, and in the development of culture. At the same time, the 10th Congress of the Communist Party of Tajikistan pointed out that there are still many untapped reserves in improving the republic's industry and agriculture. For example, we are still far behind other republics in some sectors of agriculture, in animal husbandry. We also have some backward areas, enterprises, collective farms, and state farms.

The congress pointed out the great shortcomings in the organizational and ideological work of our Party organizations. The Party's leadership of industry and agriculture is too general in nature. Party and Soviet organs are too busy drafting resolutions and issuing a large number of instructions, but rarely help to implement these resolutions and instructions with direct organizational work among the working masses. Many workers do not delve into the economics of enterprises, collective farms, and state farms, are tired of hard work, and do not provide practical guidance on how to improve industrial and agricultural production. In addition, many workers are unwilling to carry out political work among the masses. The serious shortcoming of ideological work lies in its abstractness and lack of purpose.

The 10th Congress of the Communist Party of Tajikistan entrusted the delegates attending the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to guarantee that the Communist Party of Tajikistan will gloriously complete all the tasks entrusted by the Party and achieve further strong development of the economy and culture of the Tajik Republic in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The Party organization of Tajikistan will strive to ensure that the republic can give the motherland as much industrial products, cotton, grain, livestock products, as well as products from sericulture, orchards, and grape cultivation as possible.

A nationwide socialist competition has now been launched there to achieve an average yield of 4 tons of cotton per hectare throughout the republic by 1960. Collective farms and state farms have set themselves the task for 1956 of harvesting 3 tons of cotton per hectare, of which Soviet cotton varieties are 3.3 tons per hectare and Soviet fine-fiber cotton varieties are 2.6 tons per hectare. By 1960, we should expand the area of cotton fields by about 80% and bring the total output of cotton to 1 million tons.

Comrades! Comrade Khrushchev's report made a profound Marxist analysis of the activities of our Party Central Committee in the period covered by the report. The tasks put forward in the report are the combat program for all our Party organizations, including the Tajik Party organization.

The shortcomings in the work of Party organizations pointed out in Comrade Khrushchev's report also fully apply to the Tajik Party organization. We will eliminate these shortcomings in every way and further improve the combat effectiveness of our Party organization.

The Tajik Party organization is a loyal contingent of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. By the time of the Party's 20th Congress, it has become a Party organization that has been ideologically and politically trained, is organizationally increasingly consolidated, and is closely united around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Tajik Party organization will spare no effort to work in order to make its due contribution to strengthening the strength of the Soviet motherland, and will redouble its efforts to fight for the victory of communism in our country. (Applause)

    加佛罗夫在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！这些天，在第二十次党代表大会的日子里，全体苏联人的心都为自己伟大的祖国而充满自豪感，为第五个五年计划已经胜利完成，为我们国家进入国民经济一切部门强大发展的新时期而自豪。不仅是我们的外国朋友确信第六个五年计划定会完成并且超额完成，连那些最可恶、最狂妄的敌人也承认我们有力量担负起这个宏伟计划所规定的任务。
    完成这个计划的现实性不仅由我国日益增长的强大的物质技术基础和我国的工业威力获得保证。它也由苏联人民在政治和文化方面的无比的成长，我国城乡人民学会了掌握现代技术并且善于运用科学成就而得到保证。这里还应当补充一点，由于苏联共产党的巨大关怀，我国已经培养出大量能够解决规模空前的任务的党和苏维埃领导干部、经济工作干部和思想战线的工作者。那些甚至一年以前在技术方面还不能办到的事情，今天已经能够很成功地办到了。
    到第二十次代表大会的时候，党已经更加紧密地团结在党中央委员会的周围了。
    我们热烈拥护中央委员会保卫马克思列宁主义理论不受各种歪曲的高度原则性。我们一致赞成加强中央委员会对各州、边疆区和共和国的党和苏维埃组织的工作的严格要求。我们极其满意地注意到，彻底遵守集体领导原则，加强对地方党机关的经常关怀，中央委员会对发展国民经济的最重大问题的研究，都已经收到了成效。
    由于列宁式的苏联共产党中央委员会的英明领导，我国不仅在对内政策上，并且也在对外政策方面取得了巨大成就。爱好和平的政策更加提高了苏联的国际威望，提高了全体进步人类对我们的党和苏联政府的热爱。在列宁式的中央委员会的领导下，我们将走向共产主义建设的新的胜利。（掌声）
    民族问题的很好的解决是我们党的最伟大功绩之一。苏联各民族共和国和州在彻底而永远地消灭了它们过去的经济和文化落后状态以后，现在已经是高度发展和日益繁荣的共和国和州了。苏联的各民族共和国和州，是用现代先进技术装备起来的大工业，多部门的集体农庄和国营农场的共和国和州，是有广大的高等、中等学校和科学机关网的共和国和州。在这些共和国和州里面，民族形式和社会主义内容的文化、文学、艺术不断地发展着。
    近几年来，我们辽阔的祖国的各族人民的民族自豪感和苏维埃爱国主义更加增长了。苏联所有的共和国和州的人民都把逐日增加自己对我国共产主义建设共同事业的贡献当作自己的爱国职责和民族荣誉。
    伟大的俄罗斯人民在苏联各民族共和国和州的繁荣中起了巨大的作用。
    全国各族人民将永远感激伟大的俄罗斯人民对他们的经济和文化发展的巨大帮助。（掌声）共产党的民族政策的贯彻实施，更加巩固了我国各族人民的友谊，把他们团结在一个统一的牢不可破的大家庭里。
    我国民族问题的光辉的解决，使全体进步人类感到高兴。苏联共产党的民族政策的胜利，对于殖民地和半殖民地人民说来是一个令人鼓舞的范例。同时，这种胜利也在帝国主义阵营中引起了疯狂的忿恨和本能的恐惧。帝国主义国家的反动集团拼命要缩小苏联各民族共和国在经济和文化发展方面的成就。他们在这种不体面的勾当中简直是无所不为，甚至不惜颠倒是非和径直进行污蔑。
    两年以前，伦敦出版了露骨的反动分子奥拉弗·卡劳的一本书，书名是刺眼而具有挑拨性的：“苏维埃帝国”。反动集团围绕着这本书掀起了令人难以置信的喧嚣，几乎把它捧成关于苏维埃中亚细亚的一部最详尽、最可靠的著作。但是，奥拉弗·卡劳从来没有到过中亚细亚。他的“科学调查”是根据以前从苏联逃出的那些祖国叛徒的卑鄙的谎言。
    书中的历史部分完全是经不起任何驳斥的无稽之谈。作者把卑鄙的资产阶级民族主义者、中亚细亚内战时的反革命匪徒首领和在希特勒军队中服务的各种各样的强盗一概称作民族英雄。奥拉弗·卡劳甚至还为中亚细亚和哈萨克斯坦各共和国没有消灭宗法式的生活方式而流出了鳄鱼的眼泪。
    这本书充满了对俄罗斯人民、中亚细亚和哈萨克斯坦各族人民，特别是苏联的民族知识分子的污蔑性的捏造。书的作者连那些嫁给哈萨克人、乌兹别克人、塔吉克人、土库曼人、基尔吉斯人的俄罗斯妇女也不放过。他指责俄罗斯的妇女，说她们同其他民族的代表人物结婚，目的是要压迫他们和控制他们。（笑声）
    这个诽谤者信口开河到如此程度，竟然说中亚细亚和哈萨克斯坦各共和国的许多著名的活动家由于某种“反党活动”而被镇压。例如，他曾说哈萨克共和国科学院院长萨特帕耶夫同志好像是“下落不明”。但是，萨特帕耶夫同志却是平安无事地在原来的地方工作，而且是这次代表大会的代表。卡劳还说前任乌兹别克斯坦部长会议主席阿卜杜拉赫曼诺夫同志“失踪了”。可是大家都知道，阿卜杜拉赫曼诺夫同志还健在人世，而且在高级党校毕业后担任了乌兹别克共和国的重要职务。
    显然，这些帝国主义老爷们采取这种分明是卑劣而愚蠢的诽谤，并不是因为他们生活过得好。有什么办法，让他们去狂吠吧！我们东方有句谚语：“虽然蝙蝠不喜欢阳光，但是太阳并不因此而停止发光。”（掌声）
    我们苏联人早已晓得，帝国主义老爷们，特别是美国和英国的老爷们是善于颠倒黑白的，或者像我们的乌克兰兄弟所说的，能“把猪崽变成鲫鱼”。因此，我想提一下不久以前发表的“美国总统和联合王国首相的联合宣言”。这个文件中的一些说法只能令人愤慨和发笑。如果谈到暴政和压迫，那末宣言的起草人完全是搞错了地方。暴政和压迫在美英帝国主义者和它们的同伙们所统治的地方是很容易发现的。
    葡萄牙是所谓“自由世界”的国家之一。不久以前亲自访问过非洲的资产阶级记者约翰·海特谈到葡萄牙在葡属非洲殖民地的行动时说道：“这里连一点向政治自由或自决……的道路发展的迹象都看不到。在葡属非洲最恶劣的现象之一是强迫劳动。莫三鼻给的每个健康成年男子一年要被强迫作六个月的工……。”海特说：“这虽然不完全是，但也近乎是一种奴隶制形式。”
    大家知道，北尼日利亚是英属殖民地，它的人口超过挪威、瑞典和丹麦三国人口的总和。约翰·海特在谈到北尼日利亚时说道，这里的人不仅生活极端贫困而且异常不开化。他在描述喀麦隆和它的法属部分时指出，那里75％的土著居民患着梅毒，而且每7万人中才有一个医生。
    约翰·海特在归纳他访问南非联邦的印象时作了这样的结论：这个国家的统治是建立在恐怖、狂热和偏执的基础上的。“少数白种人拒绝把最基本的权利给予其他种族的为数几达1，000万人的代表。”
    这并不是“赤色宣传”，这是资产阶级记者的见证。帝国主义者的统治结果就是这样。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在孟买的群众大会上的讲话说得很对：“我们正在度着人类的春天，这时候殖民主义奴隶制度正在崩溃，旧日的情况已经一去不复返。”现在任何污蔑、任何捏造都不能帮助帝国主义者把人民羁留在殖民主义的奴役下。
    不管帝国主义老爷们怎样污蔑，胜利将属于真诚地希望在地球上建立真正和平和幸福的各国人民。强大的社会主义阵营是不可战胜的。毫无疑问，这个阵营将日益壮大，而在这个伟大阵营中紧密团结并互相给予兄弟般帮助和支持的各国人民将沿着共产主义建设的道路不断前进。
    世界各国人民、包括东方国家的人民，都了解我国的实际情况。在印度、缅甸和阿富汗对布尔加宁同志和赫鲁晓夫同志的空前热烈的接待，特别说明了这点。这些接待已变成了东方各国人民和苏联各族人民友好的声势浩壮的表现。近二、三年中访问过苏联各民族共和国的许多外国代表团所发表的热烈的演说也说明了这一点。
    同志们！在现时的国际环境下，国外对我们祖国的兴趣、对苏联人民生活的兴趣比任何时期都要大，关于我们国家的和由我们国家发出的每句真实的话都受到前所未有的重视。这就责成我们必须把思想工作，特别是报刊宣传和无线电广播提到更高的水平。
    今天苏斯洛夫同志和米高扬同志对思想工作缺点的批评完全正确。实际上，不必说共和国和州的报纸，就是在中央的报纸和杂志上，宣传文章也常常是写得脱离生活。它们中有许多都是彼此雷同。作者常是重复着一般化的公式，害怕说出新颖的话，我们的无线电广播宣传水平也不高。我觉得，必须立即改善这种情况。
    对于我国的文学我也想说几句话。当然，如果看不见我们党在发展文学方面所作的巨大工作，那是不正确的。但是，如果对文学的发展还落后于经济的发展、还落后于苏联人民日益增长的精神要求这一事实熟视无睹，也是不对的。我国的文学没有向全世界充分揭示苏联人事业的伟大。
    我们为年轻的有才能的队伍参加文学工作而高兴。老一代作家的代表已写了许多优秀的作品。但是人民仍然困惑地谈到某些著名的语言艺术家在创作方面的消极态度。
    苏联人民对文学家怀着普遍的热爱、敬重和关怀，为他们建立了良好的创作条件，但是有时候这种热爱却得不到回报。近几年来我们的一些大作家没有给人民写出任何东西，而他们之中个别的人则作了事件的尾巴。因此难怪有人这样说：我们国家是乘着飞机前进，而某些作家是坐着大车在后面追赶。
    也许是我个人这样觉得，我总感到工业和农业部门工作人员所具有的那种热情，在文化战线的某些工作人员身上还感觉不到。
    同志们！不久以前曾举行了塔吉克斯坦共产党第十次代表大会。这次代表大会非常满意地指出，我们共和国在发展工业和农业、发展文化方面取得了显著的成绩。同时塔吉克斯坦共产党第十次代表大会指出，在提高共和国工业和农业方面仍然有大量未加利用的后备力量。例如，我们在农业的某些部门、在畜牧业方面，还大大落后于其他共和国。我们还有一些落后的区、企业、集体农庄和国营农场。
    代表大会指出了在我们党组织的组织和思想工作中的巨大缺点。党对工业和农业的领导带有过于一般化的性质。党的和苏维埃的机关太多地忙于草拟决议，发出大量指示，但却很少以在劳动群众中直接进行组织工作来帮助实现这些决议和指示。许多工作人员不深入研究企业、集体农庄和国营农场的经济，厌烦艰苦的工作，不去实际指示怎样来提高工农业生产。此外，许多工作人员不愿在群众中进行政治工作。思想工作的严重缺点在于它的抽象性和缺乏目的性。
    塔吉克斯坦共产党第十次代表大会委托出席苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的代表提出保证：塔吉克斯坦共产党将光荣地完成党的一切委托，在第六个五年计划中使塔吉克共和国的经济和文化获得进一步的强大发展。塔吉克斯坦的党组织将努力争取使本共和国能给祖国尽可能多的工业品、棉花、粮食、畜产品、以及养蚕业、果园业和葡萄种植业的产品。
    现在我们那里已展开争取在1960年在全共和国平均从每公顷收获40公担棉花的全民社会主义竞赛。集体农庄和国营农场为自己确定的1956年的任务是从每公顷收30公担棉花，其中苏联棉种是每公顷收33公担，苏联的细纤维棉种是每公顷收26公担。到1960年，我们应该把棉田的面积扩大约80％，使棉花的总产量达到100万吨。
    同志们！赫鲁晓夫同志的报告对我党中央委员会在报告所涉及的时期中的活动作了深刻的马克思主义的分析。报告中所提出的任务，是我们所有党组织、其中包括塔吉克斯坦党组织的战斗纲领。
    赫鲁晓夫同志报告中指出的党组织工作中的缺点也完全适用于塔吉克的党组织。我们将以一切方法来消除这些缺点，并更加提高我们党组织的战斗能力。
    塔吉克党组织是苏联共产党的一支忠实队伍，到党的第二十次代表大会时，它已经成为一个在思想上和政治上受过锻炼、在组织上日益巩固，并且紧密地团结在苏共中央委员会周围的党组织了。塔吉克斯坦党组织将不遗余力地工作，以便在加强苏维埃祖国的实力方面作出自己应有的贡献，并加倍努力为争取共产主义在我国胜利而斗争。（鼓掌）
