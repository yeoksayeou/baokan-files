The National United Cooperative of Tala Mountain
By our reporter Chen Yongjin

In most areas of Yunnan Province, several or more than a dozen ethnic groups live together. They have significant differences in language, writing, and living conditions; however, they all aspire to a good socialist life. Under the leadership and assistance of local Party organizations, they have established many agricultural production cooperatives jointly run by various ethnic groups. The National United Cooperative of Tala Mountain is one of them.

Traveling south from Xinping County, crossing a large mountain, you arrive at Tala Mountain. In Yangnaige Village on this mountain, there are 21 Han households, 7 Yi households, and 10 Shansu (a branch of the Yi) households.

Before liberation, the Shansu farmers lived in the greatest poverty and suffered the most oppression. They lived on D磨盘 Mountain on the eastern side of Tala Mountain. They did not know how to farm. Every planting season, they would set fire to the mountain and then scatter some seeds. They didn't weed or hoe, relying on nature to grow the crops. Coupled with the harm from wild animals, they could only harvest a few dozen kilograms of grain each year, barely enough to eat for a month. Therefore, they had to rely on weaving baskets and hunting to exchange for grain from Han and Yi farmers. They also wore tattered clothes exchanged from Yi and Han farmers. None of the 10 Shansu households had quilts in the past. The 7 Yi farmers also worked for landlords and rich peasants in the past. Before liberation, they had only 3 quilts and 2 oxen in total, and children over ten years old had no clothes to wear.

Before liberation, most of the Han farmers also rented land from landlords or raised pigs and sold some woodenware. Among the 21 households, 12 did not have enough to eat.

During the land reform, the Han, Yi, and Shansu farmers living on Tala Mountain jointly struggled against the landlords and were allocated land. The Party guided the farmers to expose the conspiracy of the Kuomintang and landlords to create ethnic divisions, and educated them about the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. The Tala Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party also mobilized the farmers of Yangnaige Village to build houses for the Shansu farmers, allowing them to move from D磨盘 Mountain to Tala Mountain to live closer to the Han and Yi people, which could reduce some living difficulties.

After the land reform, the Party led them to organize production, first forming two mutual aid teams with a dozen Han, Yi, and Shansu households. However, because the Shansu people's farming was backward, some Han and Yi farmers complained that they could not transplant rice seedlings and did not have farm tools; at that time, the Shansu farmers had too few clothes and had to wait until the sun came out to go to the fields, and the Yi and Han farmers complained that they started work too late. Within half a year of organizing, all the Shansu people withdrew.

In the autumn of 1953, the Party branch again called on them to organize a national united cooperative. At this time, some Shansu farmers said that they could not keep up with the Han and Yi people in doing work, and asked them to try it for a year first; some Shansu farmers were afraid that they would not be free after joining the cooperative and would not be able to weave baskets, which would make life difficult. Some Yi farmers were also unwilling to have Shansu people join the cooperative. After a month of deliberation, the cooperative was finally established. Only 10 Han households and 6 Yi households joined the cooperative. None of the Shansu households joined.

In the first year of the Tala Mountain Cooperative, agricultural production increased by 26%, and sideline income was more than 300 yuan. The farmers who did not participate in the cooperative clearly saw the benefits of the cooperative: participating in the cooperative meant no more scrambling for water to transplant rice seedlings; those with less labor could still have their land cultivated; the cooperative could concentrate manpower to fight disasters, and the damage to crops by wild animals was reduced; members could also do work according to their strength. In August of that year, the Tala Township National United Cooperative expanded to 36 households, and all 10 Shansu households joined the cooperative.

When the Shansu people joined the cooperative, some Han and Yi members still said: The Shansu people will be a "burden" when they come in, and it is not worth it for us to farm for them. Party branch secretary Pu Xingshun (Yi ethnicity) repeatedly educated the Yi and Han members, making them realize that the Shansu people's backwardness in production was mainly due to the great oppression they suffered in the past, and that we have a responsibility to help them progress. Some criticism was also carried out within the Party members to overcome the Han and Yi members' contempt for the Shansu people. When production in the cooperative started, the management committee paid attention to strengthening ethnic unity in all aspects. Many Han farmers in Tala Mountain can speak the Yi language, and some Shansu people also understand the Yi language, so the cooperative often used the Yi language when holding meetings. In order to teach the Shansu people all kinds of farm work, the production teams were organized by mixing Shansu members with Han and Yi members. Soon, the Shansu women all learned to transplant rice seedlings, and many Shansu members also actively learned plowing, digging, planting flue-cured tobacco, and other techniques. Youth League branch secretary Qiu Yong'an also learned the Shansu language in order to help the Shansu people. The Han and Yi people here did not know how to burn charcoal or weave baskets. Since the Shansu people joined the cooperative, many people have learned these skills. When the Shansu members went to find medicinal materials, they also took the Han and Yi members with them. Sometimes they also gave the woven baskets to the Yi and Han members to use.

In the past, the Yi people had opinions about the Han people but dared not speak up, and the Shansu people dared not speak up about the Yi and Han people. Last year, before it was time to harvest sweet potatoes, Han members Qiu Zhibin and Li Guotai privately dug some sweet potatoes from the field; the Shansu members raised objections to them, pointing out that they should not take public property. The management committee commended the Shansu people who raised the objections, and Qiu Zhibin and Li Guotai also examined their mistakes. In this way, a spirit of mutual criticism among the members was established, and they no longer dared not speak up about their opinions as they did in the past. The members of each group truly showed brotherly care and help.

The Tala Mountain National United Cooperative fought against natural disasters with collective strength and achieved a bumper harvest. When planting summer crops last year, the weather was dry, and they used several waterwheels to draw water from the Tala River. As a result, the cooperative's crops not only did not decrease in production, but also increased by one-third. In the past, they did not plant flue-cured tobacco. After the cooperative was established, they tried planting flue-cured tobacco, which greatly increased their income. They carried out water conservancy construction, opening a ditch from "Jingguai Pool," which no one dared to go to in the past, and diverting the pool water from five miles away to their rice fields, changing the habit of relying on rainfall to transplant rice seedlings and ensuring water for the rice fields. In the past, during droughts, they watched the clear water flow down the mountain without being able to irrigate the crops; once the autumn floods came, no one dared to say that their crops would not be flooded. After the cooperative was established, they could divert river water to the mountain during droughts, and divert the floodwater back to the river when floods came, so they were no longer afraid of droughts or floods. In the past, when they worked individually, they could not watch out for wild animals well, and people had to "compete" with wild animals for grain. Last autumn, the cooperative drew two old hunters to build sheds in the mountains to specialize in hunting wild animals, so that the crops on the high mountains were also not harmed. There are many camphor trees here, which no one cared about in the past. Now the cooperative is sending people to learn how to boil camphor.

The cooperative has only been running for two years, but this multi-ethnic mountain village has changed its appearance. People have begun to get rid of poverty and are moving step by step towards a happy road. The grain distributed to each member household is enough to eat. Especially the 10 Shansu households have changed the situation of not having enough grain to eat for generations. The members almost all have fat pigs and flocks of chickens in their homes, and the bamboo granaries of each household are filled with rice. Last year, the whole cooperative sold 7,600 kilograms of surplus grain to the state for the first time, which had never happened on Tala Mountain before. What are people's feelings about their cooperative? Deputy Director Zhu Youlu introduced to me while holding his baby: This child is named "Cooperation," which is a name given to commemorate our participation in the cooperative. According to him, some babies are also named "Joining the Cooperative" and "Expanding the Cooperative." In order to build Tala Mountain more beautiful and prosperous, the cooperative has recently added waterwheels and plows, bought threshing machines, and built flue-cured tobacco houses. They will produce more grain and flue-cured tobacco this year, so that the lives of the members will be more prosperous and happier.

    他拉山的民族联合社
    本报记者　陈勇进
    在云南省的绝大部分地区，都是几个或十几个民族聚居在一起。他们在语言、文字和生活条件上有很大的差异；但是，他们一致向往美好的社会主义生活。在各地党组织的领导和帮助下，他们成立了很多各民族联合的农业生产合作社。他拉山的民族联合社就是其中的一个。
    从新平县向南走，翻过一座大山，便到了他拉山。在这个山上的羊奶革村，有21户汉族，7户彝族，10户山苏族（彝族的支系）。
    解放以前，山苏族农民的生活最为贫困，受的压迫也最大。他们住在他拉山东面的大磨盘山上，不会种田，每到播种季节，就放火烧山，然后撒下点种籽；不薅不锄，听天生长，加以野兽为害，每年只能收几十斤粮食，仅够一个月吃的。因此，他们不得不靠编箩、打猎去向汉族、彝族的农民换粮食吃。他们穿的，也是向彝、汉族农民换来的破衣服。这10户山苏族过去都没被子。7户彝族农民，过去也是给地主富农种地的，解放前总共才有3条被子两条牛，十来岁的孩子都穿不上衣服。
    汉族农民在解放前也大多是租种地主的土地或是养猪、做些木器卖，21户中就有12户不够吃的。
    土地改革的时候，居住在他拉山的汉族、彝族、山苏族农民，联合斗争了地主，分得了土地。党引导农民揭发了国民党和地主制造民族隔阂的阴谋，向他们进行了各民族共同富裕的教育。中共他拉乡支部还动员羊奶革村的农民给山苏族农民盖了房子，让他们从大磨盘山搬到他拉山上来住，靠近汉族和彝族，可以减少一些生活上的困难。
    土地改革以后，党又领导他们组织起来生产，先由十几户汉族、彝族和山苏族成立了两个互助组。可是由於山苏族的耕作落后，有些汉、彝族农民就嫌他们不会插秧、没有农具；当时山苏农民衣服太少要等到太阳出来才能下地，彝族汉族农民又嫌他们上工太晚。组织起来不到半年，山苏族都退出去了。
    1953年秋天，党支部又号召他们组织民族联合社。这时，有的山苏族农民就说干活赶不上汉、彝族，叫他们先干一年试试看；有的山苏族农民怕入了社不自由，没法编箩，生活会困难。有的彝族农民也不愿意要山苏人入社。前后酝酿了一个月，合作社总算成立起来了。入社的只有10户汉族和6户彝族，山苏族都没有入社。
    他拉山合作社组织起来的第一年，农业增产了26％，副业收入300多元。没参加社的农民，清楚地看到了合作社的好处：参加合作社就不用再抢水插秧了；劳力少的，土地同样得到加工；合作社可以集中人力抗灾，野兽毁坏庄稼的情形少了；社员们还可以根据自己的力量来干活。就在这年的8月，他拉乡的民族联合社扩大到36户，10户山苏族全都入了社。
    山苏族入社的时候，有一些汉族和彝族社员还是说：山苏人进来就得“背包袱”，我们给他们种田划不来。党支部书记普兴顺（彝族）就反复地向彝族汉族社员进行教育，使他们认识：山苏人生产上落后，主要是过去受的压迫大，我们有责任帮助他们进步。在党员内部也进行了一些批评，克服了汉族彝族社员瞧不起山苏人的思想。社里的生产开始了，管理委员会在各方面都注意到要加强民族团结。他拉山的汉族农民多会说彝话，山苏人有些也懂彝话，所以合作社在开会的时候，就多用彝话。为了要把各种农活教给山苏人，编生产队时就把山苏族社员和汉族彝族社员混合编在一起，很快山苏族妇女就都学会了插秧，很多山苏族社员还积极学习犁田、挖田、栽烤烟等技术。青年团支部书记邱永安，为了帮助山苏人，也学会了山苏话。这里的汉族和彝族人不会烧木炭，不会编箩，自从山苏人入社后，很多人也都学会了。山苏族社员去找药材时，也主动地带着汉彝族社员去找。有时他们还把自己编好的箩筐送给彝族汉族社员使用。
    过去，彝人对汉人有意见不敢讲，山苏人对彝人和汉人有意见更不敢讲。去年不到收红薯的时候，汉族社员邱志彬和李国太私自从地里挖了些红薯；山苏族的社员向他们提意见，指出不该拿公家的东西。管委会表扬了提意见的山苏人，邱志彬、李国太也检讨了自己的错误。这样，树立了社员之间相互批评的风气，再不像过去那样有意见不敢讲了。各组社员真正地做到了兄弟般的关怀和帮助。
    他拉山民族联合社用集体的力量向自然灾害进行了斗争，得到了丰收。去年夏种的时候，天气干旱，他们用几道水车从他拉河里把水绞上来。结果，社里的庄稼不但没有减产，还增产了三分之一。过去他们不种烤烟，成立合作社后试种了烤烟，增加了很大的收入。他们进行了水利建设，从过去没人敢去的“精怪潭”开了一条水沟，把潭水从五里外引到他们的稻田里，改变了靠天下雨插秧的习惯，保证了稻田的用水。过去天旱时眼看着清清的流水从山上流下去，浇不到庄稼；一遇到秋天发大水，谁也不敢说自己的庄稼能不受淹。成立合作社后，天旱时能把河水引上山，洪水下来又能把它引到河里去，再也不怕旱、不怕淹了。过去单干的时候，不能很好地看野兽，人要和野兽“抢”粮食吃。去年秋天，社里抽了两个老猎手在山地里搭了棚，专门打野兽，使高山上的庄稼也没受害。这里有很多樟脑树，过去从没人过问，现在合作社正派人学习熬樟脑。
    合作社才办了两年，这个多民族的山村已经变了样，人们开始摆脱了穷困，一步一步向着幸福的道路上走。各户社员分的粮食都够吃了。特别是10户山苏族农民，已经改变了世世代代粮食不够吃的情况。社员们几乎家家都有肥猪和鸡群，户户的竹囤里都堆放着稻子。去年全社第一次卖给国家7，600斤余粮，这是他拉山上从来没有过的事。人们对自己的合作社是什么情感呢？副社长祝有禄抱着他的娃娃向我介绍：这个孩子叫“合作”，这是为了纪念我们参加合作社而起的名字。据他说，还有的娃娃叫“入社”“扩社”。为了把他拉山建设得更美丽富饶，社里最近新添了水车、耕牛，买了打谷机，盖了烤烟房。他们要在今年生产更多的粮食和烤烟，让社员的生活过得更富裕，更幸福。
