    Chairman, esteemed leaders, and comrades:
    I am a member of the business community in Macau. It is a great honor and encouragement for me to be able to come to the capital to participate in the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and study alongside you advanced individuals!
    My understanding of the Communist Party in the past did not come from books, but from the influence of a Communist Party member. From 1941 onwards, I worked with this Party member in the Kiang Wu Hospital in Macau, a charitable institution, doing volunteer work. In nearly ten years, I witnessed firsthand that what he did was entirely for the service of the people, not for fame, and certainly not for profit. He served the Macau compatriots wholeheartedly for a long time. I was deeply moved by his selfless spirit and recognized the noble qualities of a Communist Party member. Over the years, various rumors outside said how terrible the Communist Party was. Based on my own experience, I determined that it was absolutely not the case, so I did not believe them at all. I usually read progressive publications regularly and pay attention to studying government measures, believing that to save the Chinese people from suffering, it would be impossible to succeed without the leadership of the Communist Party to complete the revolution. Therefore, over the years, I have supported and supported the patriotic movements of local compatriots, doing my best.
    In the past short six years, all undertakings in the motherland have progressed rapidly and prosperously. Due to work restrictions, I have not been able to spare a longer period of time to return for sightseeing in previous years, only able to make a hurried trip to Guangzhou at most each year. It was not until late last month that I invited friends from all walks of life in Macau to organize a tour group to visit major cities in the motherland, touring industrial and mining enterprises, water conservancy projects, and various emerging undertakings. Seeing is believing, and all the construction achievements are far more magnificent than reported in the newspapers. This time, we were also extremely fortunate to encounter the completion of the joint state-private ownership of all industries and trades in major cities across the country, entering a happy socialist society. I personally saw every industrialist and businessman with joy on their faces, celebrating with each other. This is an ironclad fact, and it is hard to believe if you don't see it with your own eyes!
    We also met with Premier Zhou in Beijing. In the two-hour conversation, we received great enlightenment and gained a further understanding of the country's efforts in socialist construction and the implementation of various national policies for peaceful diplomacy. In addition, we attended several meetings and were deeply impressed and moved by the truly democratic style of our leaders, especially the kind and approachable demeanor of Chairman Mao. The day before yesterday, I listened to Premier Zhou's political report, which was indeed a great lesson for me, making me more firmly believe that the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is entirely for the country and the people, and will surely enable the motherland to embark on the road of prosperity and strength. I am willing to guarantee that in the future, I will do my best to support all government facilities and work hard to learn, and strive to bring what I have seen and heard back to Macau and overseas, to introduce them in detail to my compatriots, so that the local compatriots can better understand the motherland and love the motherland more.
    As for how to further encourage overseas compatriots to recognize the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland, I believe that in addition to reporting through newspapers and periodicals, we should also organize more art troupes and tour groups to go overseas to introduce the construction situation of the motherland in the past six years, to influence those compatriots who are blinded by rumors, so that they can truly recognize the new face of the motherland, love the motherland, and jointly move towards a bright and happy socialist society. During my trip, I saw in the newspaper many articles written by friends in the industrial and commercial circles about accepting transformation and supporting transformation. I was very moved and realized that every word they said came from the bottom of their hearts. But if it is reported abroad in this way, under the slander and defamation of general reactionary newspapers and periodicals, many compatriots will still be skeptical. I think that domestic advanced patriotic people in the industrial and commercial circles should have more contact with overseas industrial and commercial circles. In addition to correspondence, they can also travel abroad to tell their relatives and friends living overseas in person. I believe it will be of great benefit to uniting and educating overseas compatriots. If anything is inappropriate, please give your opinions.

    何贤的发言
    主席、各位首长、各位同志：
    我是澳门工商界一分子，此次能够到首都参加人民政协第二届全国委员会第二次会议，追随各位先进一同学习，感觉得无上光荣，同时也受到莫大的鼓励！
    我过去对共产党的认识，并不是从书本上得来，而是得力于一位党员同志的感召。从1941年起，我在澳门一所慈善性质的镜湖医院和这位党员同志共同从事义务工作。在差不多十年的时间里，我亲眼看见他所做的事情，完全是为人民服务，不为名，更不为利，长时期地全心全意为澳门同胞服务，我深深受到他那种忘我精神的感动，认识到共产党员的高贵品质。若干年来，外面种种谣言，说共产党如何可怕，我凭自己的经验，断定绝无其事，因此一概不信。平时对于进步刊物，经常阅读，对于政府措施也注意学习，认定要拯救中国人民脱离痛苦，非由共产党领导完成革命，绝难成功。所以历年来对于当地同胞的爱国运动，拥护支持，稍尽棉薄。
    祖国在过去短短六年之中，一切事业无不突飞猛进，蒸蒸日上。本人因为工作上的限制，前几年始终未能抽出较长时间回来观光，每年至多只能匆匆到广州一行。直至上月下旬，才邀集了澳门各界的朋友，组织了一个观光团，回到祖国各大城市参观工矿、水利以及各项新兴事业。真是耳闻不如目睹，所有建设成就远比报纸所报道的还要辉煌得多。此次我们又万分幸运，刚好遇到全国各大都市的工商业完成全行业公私合营，进入幸福的社会主义社会，我亲眼见到每一个工商界同胞，都是喜形于色，额手相庆。这是铁一般的事实，如果不是亲眼看见，简直难于置信！
    我们又在京中谒见了周总理，在两小时的谈话中，得到了莫大的启示，对于国家努力社会主义建设以及推行和平外交的种种国策，有了进一步认识。此外又列席了几次会议，对于我各位首长的真正的民主作风，尤其是毛主席的和蔼可亲的风度，更使得我钦敬和感动。前天又听了周总理的政治报告，对于我来说，确实是上了无数次的大课，使我更坚定地相信中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，完全是为国为民，必定能够使得祖国走上繁荣富强的大道。我愿保证今后一定尽我所能，拥护政府一切设施，并努力学习，务将此次所见所闻，尽量带回澳门和海外，向同胞们详细介绍，使当地一般同胞更加了解祖国，更加热爱祖国。
    至于如何进一步争取海外同胞认识祖国的社会主义建设与社会主义改造事业，我以为除了通过报刊报道以外，还应该多组织各种艺术团及旅行团，到海外去介绍祖国六年来建设情况，来影响一般受谣言蒙蔽的同胞，使他们真正认识祖国的新面貌，热爱祖国，共同走向光明幸福的社会主义社会。我此次在旅行期中，曾在报上看到许多位工商界朋友所写的关于接受改造、拥护改造的文字，我非常受感动，认识到他们的一字一句，都是出诸肺腑。但如果就这样报道到国外，在一般反动报刊谣言诬蔑之下，许多同胞还是会将信将疑的。我想国内先进的工商界爱国人士，应当与海外的工商界多多联系，除通讯外，还可到国外旅行，向居住海外的亲友现身说法，相信对于团结和教育海外同胞，必定有很大好处。是否有当，请各位同志指教。
