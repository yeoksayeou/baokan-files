    Chinese Commodities Exhibition in Japan
    Cao Zhongshu, Head of the Chinese International Trade Promotion Committee's Commodities Exhibition Delegation to Japan
    According to the provisions of the Third China-Japan Trade Agreement, we held the Chinese Commodities Exhibition in Japan. Through this exhibition, the broad masses of the Japanese people gained a new understanding of the achievements of the new China's economic construction over the past few years, a clear understanding of the broad prospects for China-Japan trade, and enhanced the friendship between the two peoples.
    The Chinese Commodities Exhibition caused a sensation throughout Japan. Over 1.9 million people visited the exhibition in 32 days, with a maximum of 215,000 people in one day. Japanese friends have told me more than once: "This is an unprecedented event in Japan." In terms of the number of visitors per day, this is also the highest record among the 26 international expositions that our country has participated in before and after.
    The visitors came not only from Tokyo and Osaka, but also from Otaru City in Hokkaido, the northernmost part of Japan, and Nagasaki and Fukuoka City in the southernmost part, led by their mayors, who organized visiting groups and traveled long distances to visit, and held discussions with the heads of the exhibition delegation to express friendship and hope. The mayor of Nagoya, the governor of Oita Prefecture, the mayor of Beppu, and others sent delegations to request to exhibit in their areas or to visit and inspect. The visitors included people from all walks of life. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan notified its local grassroots trade unions to organize workers to visit. Japanese students regarded visiting the exhibition as part of their social science course. Some people came almost every day, and many people looked at it again and again with reluctance. An elementary school student wrote in the opinion book: "Although it is already 6 pm, I am still reluctant to leave here. How happy I am to be able to make friends with the Chinese people!" The famous Japanese female painter Toshiko Akamatsu said: "Seeing such a torrent, I couldn't help but shed tears." What was particularly touching was that students from schools for the blind and deaf in Tokyo and Osaka also visited the exhibition. Although they could not see or speak, they wanted to touch "New China" with their hands. There was also an elderly man with hemiplegia who asked someone to carry him to visit. After the visit, he said: "After the war, I suffered from this incurable disease for the sake of China-Japan friendship and the development of China-Japan trade. Today, I can see the new China with my own eyes, and I can die in peace." At that time, tears filled his eyes, and he was reluctant to leave.
    The cinema attached to the exhibition was very popular. During the exhibition in Tokyo, although it often rained, the cinema was still full. Many people held umbrellas in the rain and lined up in long queues, waiting to enter. More than 400,000 people in Tokyo and Osaka watched Chinese films. Many people envied the lives of the liberated Chinese people and were moved by that rich and healthy life. A young man said after watching "May Day": "Seeing this film, I have hope for tomorrow. It seems to have judged my future."
    The Japanese people's deep friendship with the new China was also specifically manifested in their concern and support for the Chinese Commodities Exhibition. In order to assist in the preparation and promotion of the exhibition, more than 40 friendly organizations in Tokyo and Osaka jointly organized cooperation associations. The Japanese worker brothers who directly participated in the exhibition work worked enthusiastically day and night with a serious and responsible attitude. The Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation specially opened a bus line for the exhibition and increased the number of buses and trams. The Osaka-Kobe and Osaka-Kyoto trams reduced fares to give preferential treatment to passengers, facilitating group visits. Japanese newspapers and magazines also attached great importance to the exhibition. Each newspaper sent reporters stationed at the venue, and published a large number of extensive news and pictures of the exhibition. Some newspapers also published editorials and special issues. Television and radio stations in Tokyo and Osaka broadcasted news from the venue.
    Overseas Chinese gave even more active support and assistance to the motherland's exhibition. The exhibition also gave them great encouragement and education. Someone said: "Now we see the machines of the motherland and are moved to tears. The rapid development of the motherland has made us overseas Chinese stand tall."
    The Chinese Commodities Exhibition Delegation spent 4 months in Japan in a tense, enthusiastic, and pleasant process. Japanese friends visited in an endless stream. In addition to congratulating the success of the exhibition and paying tribute to the Chinese people, Japanese friends unanimously expressed their desire to establish friendly relations with the Chinese people, and especially hoped that China and Japan would establish diplomatic relations, coexist peacefully, and have free exchanges as soon as possible. They generally felt regretful about the current abnormal relationship between China and Japan. Japanese State Minister Takasaki Tatsunosuke said at the opening ceremony in Tokyo: "Our country has been greatly influenced by China in all aspects, such as politics, economy, and culture, since 1,500 years ago. The blood, flesh, and heart of the Japanese people are connected with the Chinese people. These two countries, which have deep historical and geographical ties, have not yet been able to shake hands, and I feel regret from the bottom of my heart. We hope to restore the old intimate relationship as soon as possible. This is the responsibility of the Japanese people." Ikeda Masanosuke, Permanent Director of the League for Promoting Japan-China Trade of the Japanese Diet, said that this exhibition "has historical significance not only in the trade relations between China and Japan, but also in the friendly relations between the two countries." Professor Oyama Ikuo, a famous Japanese peace activist who recently passed away, said after the visit: "The Chinese Commodities Exhibition has made the Japanese people feel more and more that China and Japan must not only promote economic exchanges, but also join hands to restore diplomatic relations as soon as possible."
    The Chinese Commodities Exhibition gave the Japanese people a very deep impression. They were very surprised by the achievements of the new China in the short few years since its founding. They believed that it was a remarkable thing that China could manufacture machines on its own. The Japanese "Industrial Economic News" published an editorial saying: "Among the various exhibits at the Chinese Commodities Exhibition, machine tools, mining machinery, and electrical equipment have particularly attracted the attention of the audience." It pointed out: "China had almost no heavy industry in the past. Since the founding of the new China, it has developed to the point where it can manufacture these machines. This cannot be ignored." Many visitors wrote down their feelings. Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi said: "I think China's industry has already laid a solid foundation." Through the exhibition, the Japanese people deeply realized that only in an independent and autonomous country that pursues a peaceful policy can they build their own country, and only then can the people have a happy life. Someone wrote in the guestbook: "We found 'independence' in the Chinese Commodities Exhibition Hall. Only here can there be independence and peace."
    Developing economic exchanges and trade between China and Japan is the urgent demand and desire of the Japanese people. Through this exhibition, the Japanese people are even more convinced that China-Japan trade has broad prospects for development. The Japanese people generally reflected after the visit: "China has a really rich source of goods. Japan's main raw materials and food can be bought from China." With the continuous development of China's industrial and agricultural production, it is even more conducive to having a sufficient supply. For many products that Japan needs to export, the Japanese business community also has great expectations due to the needs of our economic construction and the vast market. There is no doubt that developing China-Japan trade is beneficial to the economies of both countries, but it is even more beneficial to Japan, which must rely on foreign markets for its main raw materials and most of its products. It is by no means accidental that the Japanese people so strongly demand the rapid restoration of normal trade relations between the two countries.
    The Japanese people also further realized from the exhibition that the United States' forcing Japan to "embargo" China is unreasonable. The Japanese people have seen with their own eyes that the US "embargo" has not hindered the rapid development of China's economic construction, but Japan has suffered many difficulties and irreparable losses as a result of implementing this policy. Therefore, the broad masses of the Japanese people expressed a deep-seated attitude of abhorrence towards the Japanese government's implementation of the US "embargo" measures against China, and resolutely demanded the rapid lifting of the "embargo" against China. Mr. Tajima Masao, head of the Japanese economic and industrial delegation to China last year, said to people after returning home: "We visited the Czechoslovak Industrial Exhibition in Shanghai and the Soviet Exhibition in Guangzhou, and saw many of the latest machines and other materials. These are exactly the materials that the United States is 'embargoing', but China can buy them from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. But Japan is still implementing the US 'embargo' policy, and even wooden ships are not allowed to be exported to China." Therefore, they passed a resolution against the "embargo" against China at the report meeting after returning home. Judging from the exhibition delegation's visits to Hiroshima, Oita, Beppu, Fukuoka and other cities, as well as the contacts with Japanese business people and some government officials in Tokyo and Osaka, they all expressed dissatisfaction with the abnormal status quo of China-Japan trade relations. Especially in the regions that have historically had the closest trade relations with China, such as Kansai and Kyushu, the atmosphere against the "embargo" is even stronger. Now opposing the "embargo" has become a strong and common demand of the Japanese people, especially business people. They have clearly realized that China-Japan trade has a future only if all man-made obstacles are eliminated.
    In our contacts with Japanese friends or in our speeches, we have told the Japanese people more than once: The Chinese government and people have always followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and are willing to establish friendly relations and develop trade with any country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We are even more willing to establish this relationship with our neighbor Japan. Developing economic and cultural exchanges based on the needs and possibilities of both sides is not only of great benefit to the economic development of China and Japan and the improvement of people's lives, but also helps the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    Over the past year, thanks to the joint efforts of the people and the vast business community of China and Japan, China-Japan trade has made new progress, but it is still far from the extent to which China and Japan can develop. In the future, we are willing to continue friendly cooperation with the Japanese people on the existing basis and work together to strive for the early establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and promote the normalization of China-Japan trade.

    中国商品展览会在日本
    中国国际贸易促进委员会赴日商品展览团团长　曹中枢
    根据第三次中日贸易协定的规定，我们在日本举办了中国商品展览会。通过这次展出，使日本广大人民对新中国几年来经济建设成就有了新的了解，对中日贸易的广阔前途有了明确认识，并且增进了两国人民的友谊。
    中国商品展览会轰动了整个日本。32天的展出就有190多万人参观，最多的一天达21.5万人。日本朋友们不止一次地告诉我：“这在日本是空前的盛况。”从每天的参观人数来说，这在我国前后参加国际博览会共26次中，也是最高纪录。
    参观的人们不只来自东京、大坂两地，日本最北部的北海道小樽市，最南端的长崎、福冈市，都由市长带头组织参观团，不辞跋涉地前来参观，并且和展览团负责人举行了座谈，表达了友谊和希望。名古屋市长，大分县知事，别府市长等都派了代表团来，要求到该地展出或去参观访问。参观的观众包括了各个阶层。日本工会总评议会曾通知所属各地基层工会，组织工人参观。日本学生把参观展览会作为社会科学课程之一。有些人几乎是每天来看，很多人恋恋不舍地看了一遍又一遍。一个小学生在意见簿上写道：“虽然已到下午6点，但是我仍舍不得离开这里，能和中国人交朋友是多么幸福啊！”日本著名女画家赤松俊子说：“看到这样的洪流，我忍不住掉下了眼泪。”尤其令人感动的是东京和大坂的盲哑学校学生也来参观了展览会，他们虽然目不能视，口不能言，但也要用手摸摸“新中国”。还有一位半身不遂的老人，要别人背着他来参观，参观后他说：“战后我曾为中日友好和开展中日贸易奔走而患此不治之症，今天我能亲眼看到新中国，就死也瞑目了。”当时泪水盈眶，依依不想离去。
    展览会附设的电影院受到很大的欢迎。在东京展出期间，虽然经常下雨，但是电影院仍是场场满座。很多人在雨天打着伞，排着很长的行列，等候入场。东京、大坂两地共有40多万人观看了中国电影。许多人羡慕解放了的中国人民的生活，并且被那种丰富健康的生活所感动。一个青年看了“五一劳动节”后说：“我看到这部影片，使我对明天抱有希望，它好像判定了我的未来。”
    日本人民对新中国的深厚友谊，还具体表现在对中国商品展览会的关怀和支持上。为了协助展览会的筹建和宣传，东京、大坂都有40多个友好团体统一组织了协力会。直接参与展览工作的日本工人兄弟，更以认真负责的态度热情地昼夜工作。东京都交通局特为展览会增辟了一条汽车专线，还增加了汽车电车的数量。大坂—神户和大坂—京都的电车，都减价优待乘客，便利了团体参观。日本的报纸杂志对展览会也很重视，各报派有驻会场记者，都大量地、广泛地刊登了展览会的消息和图片，有的报纸还发表了社论和专刊。东京、大坂的电视和广播都广播了会场新闻。
    华侨对祖国展览会，更是积极支持和协助的。展览会也给了他们极大的鼓舞和教育。有人说：“现在我们看到祖国的机器，感动得流泪。祖国的迅速发展，已经使我们华侨挺起胸膛来了。”
    中国商品展览团在日本的4个月，都是在紧张热烈愉快的过程中渡过的。来访的日本朋友络绎不绝。日本朋友们除祝贺展览会的成功和对中国人民致意外，都一致表达了和中国人民建立友好关系的愿望，特别希望中日两国早日建立邦交，和平共处，自由往来。对中日两国目前不正常的关系普遍感到遗憾。日本国务大臣高碕达之助在东京开幕式上说：“我国在政治、经济、文化等各方面，从1，500年前就受到中国极大的影响。日本人民的血、肉和心都是和中国人民相连的。在历史上地理上有着深切关系的这两个国家，现在还未能握起手来，从心里感到遗憾。我们希望能够更早一天恢复旧有的亲密关系，这是日本人民的责任。”日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟常任理事池田正之辅说：这次展览会“不仅在中日两国的贸易关系上，而且在两国友好的关系上都有着历史意义”。最近病故的日本著名和平人士大山郁夫教授在参观后说：“中国商品展览会已经使日本人民越发感到中日两国不但必须促进经济交流，而且必须携起手来早日恢复邦交。”
    中国商品展览会给予日本人民的印象是非常深刻的。他们对新中国成立后短短几年来的成就非常惊讶。认为中国能自己制造机器是件了不起的大事。日本“产业经济新闻”发表社论说：“在中国商品展览会的各种展品当中，工作母机、矿山机械、电气器材等特别引起观众的注意。”它指出：“中国在从前几乎没有重工业，新中国成立以来，竟发展到能制造这些机械的程度，这是不容忽视的。”很多参观的人写下了自己的感想。通商产业省大臣石桥湛山说：“我认为中国的工业已经打定了基础。”通过展览会，日本人民深刻体会到只有在独立自主、奉行和平政策的国家内，才能建设自己的国家，人民也才会有愉快的生活。有人在留言簿上写道：“我们在中国商品展览馆里发现了‘独立’，这里才有独立与和平”。
    发展中日两国的经济交流和贸易往来，是日本人民的迫切要求和愿望。通过这次展览会，日本人民更加深信中日贸易有着广阔发展的前途。日本人民在参观后普遍反映：“中国货源真丰富，日本所需要的主要原料和食粮都可从中国买到。”随着中国工农业生产的不断发展，更具备了充分供应的有利条件。对于日本需要输出的很多产品，由于我国经济建设的需要和幅员广阔的市场，日本工商界也抱有莫大的期望。毫无疑问，开展中日贸易对两国经济都有好处，但是对于主要原料和绝大部分产品都必须依靠国外市场的日本说来，是更为有利的。日本人民如此强烈地要求迅速恢复两国的正常贸易关系，就绝不是偶然的事。
    日本人民从展览会上还进一步认识到美国强迫日本对中国“禁运”是毫无道理的。日本人民亲眼看到了美国的“禁运”，并未能阻碍中国经济建设的迅速发展，但是日本却因执行这一政策遭到了不少困难和不可弥补的损失。因此，日本广大人民对日本政府执行美国对中国的“禁运”措施，表示了深恶痛绝的态度，并坚决要求迅速取消对中国的“禁运”。去年来中国的日本访华工商界代表团团长田岛正雄回国后对人说：“我们在上海参观了捷克斯洛伐克工业展览会，在广州参观了苏联展览会，看到了许多最新式机器和其它物资，这些正是美国‘禁运’的物资，而中国却可以从苏联及人民民主国家买到。但日本还在执行美国的‘禁运’政策，连木造船等等也不准向中国输出。”因此，他们在回国后的报告会上通过了反对对中国“禁运”的决议。从展览团访问广岛、大分、别府、福冈等城市以及在东京、大坂同日本工商界人士和一些政府官员的接触情况来看，他们一致对中日贸易关系的不正常现状表示不满，特别是在历史上同中国贸易往来最密切的地区，如关西和九州，反对“禁运”的空气更为浓厚。现在反对“禁运”已成为日本人民，特别是工商界人士的一种强大的普遍要求了。他们已明确地认识到，只有消除一切人为障碍，中日贸易才有前途。
    我们在和日本朋友们的接触中或在讲话中，都不止一次地告诉日本人民：中国政府和人民一贯遵循和平共处五项原则，并愿在平等互利的基础上同任何国家建立友好关系和开展贸易往来，更愿意和近邻的日本建立这种关系。根据双方的需要和可能发展经济和文化交流，这不仅对中日两国的经济发展和人民生活的改善有很大好处，而且有助于亚洲和世界的和平事业的发展。
    过去一年来，经过中日两国人民和广大工商界人士的共同努力，中日贸易有了新的发展，但是离开中日两国所能发展的程度还相差很远。今后我们愿意在现有的基础上和日本人民继续友好合作，为争取中日两国邦交早日建立和促进中日贸易正常化而共同努力。
