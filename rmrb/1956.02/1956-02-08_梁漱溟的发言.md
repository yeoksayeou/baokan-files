    I fully support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, and I also very much agree with the five reports successively made by Vice-Chairman Li, Vice-Chairman Guo, Vice-Chairman Chen, Vice-Chairman Dong, and Comrade Chen Boda. All these reports should be adopted by the Congress as resolutions and used as our guidelines. In the past two days, many comrades have made excellent speeches, which are moving and inspiring, demonstrating the unity of the people's hearts. I must also say a few words here.
    As everyone knows, before the high tide of the socialist revolution appeared across the country, representatives of the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) went to various parts of the country for inspections. I also went to Gansu Province with my CPPCC colleagues. There, for about 50 days, I personally saw how all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce were progressing on the road to socialism. I saw the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises and the cooperativization of handicrafts in Lanzhou City, and the agricultural cooperativization in Yuzhong County and Gaolan County. From what I saw, the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises and the cooperativization of handicrafts were advancing steadily—not slowly, but very steadily. In agriculture, the progress seemed too rapid, but at least it was basically healthy. All of you here are concerned about our socialist cause. If you ask me, having not been there to see it: what do you think after seeing it? I would say: I am very satisfied. Regarding all the inspection work in Gansu Province, the three of us who went to inspect together have already made a written report, tens of thousands of words long, which I will not repeat here. I will just say a few more words about the issue of agricultural cooperativization, so that what I said above is not too general. Why did I say that the progress of agricultural cooperativization seemed too rapid? Because in Yuzhong and Gansu, the number of peasant households originally participating in cooperative organizations was only about 20% of the total number of peasant households, but now it has increased to over 80%, approaching 90%. Wasn't that seemingly too rapid? But why did I say above that it was a healthy development? Because in our inspections in various places, we did not see any impression of crude and shoddy work; on the contrary, we saw some meticulous and conscientious work; throughout the entire inspection process, we did not find any problems. Perhaps my personal ability is too poor, and the time is limited, not enough to discover problems. But doesn't this mean that it is basically very healthy?
    Why do I say this? Because I thought of a passage in Premier Zhou's political report that day, and also thought of Chairman Mao's repeated instructions to me over the past few years. In the political report, in the section on the transformation of intellectuals, it was said that it should be done through three interconnected channels, namely, through observation and practice of social life, through the practice of one's own profession, and through the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism. Isn't going out for on-the-spot inspections the first of those? Observing and practicing social life is most effective in transforming the thinking of old intellectuals. Premier Zhou's report on intellectuals, made at the meeting convened by the Party Central Committee, explained it more fully and in more detail. It is clear if you refer to it. The leading Party and Chairman Mao have always emphasized this point. I myself estimate that from the spring of 1950, when I arrived in Beijing, until 1951 and 1952, Chairman Mao always instructed me to go out and contact reality more often. He gave me instructions personally on four separate occasions. Some of them I accepted and went out; some I accepted after a long delay; some I did not accept at all. In particular, in the summer of 1952, Chairman Mao wanted me to go out to do social investigation, but I did not accept it. After receiving the effect of contacting reality in this inspection, I realized Chairman Mao's intentions and deeply regretted that I had failed Chairman Mao's loving intentions in the past! Therefore, this inspection can play a great role for the majority of representatives and members, but I am afraid it is not worth mentioning. As long as I receive some self-transformation, I will have completed my task.
    Last year (1955), from January to December, various sectors launched a thought criticism movement against me. How did I feel and react in this movement? I should say something about it here. Because the CPPCC is a form of united front organization, it is essential to work hard for national unity. Whether it is one person's affair or something that everyone is concerned about, I should frankly tell the leaders and friends from all sides.
    In the past year, besides what was published in newspapers and magazines, there were also several symposiums held at the Academy of Sciences criticizing my thinking. In newspapers and magazines, I have not made any expression, only at one symposium, I expressed my support for this criticism movement. At that time, Mr. Guo Moruo said that he wanted to put a question mark on whether what I said was "sincere." His question was very good, and I will start from here.
    I expressed my welcome to all parties' criticism of me and supported this movement to criticize me. Mr. Guo Moruo wanted to put a question mark, that is to say: are you really like that in your heart? I am afraid not! That's right, my heart is not as simple and straightforward as my mouth says. There are contradictions and struggles in my heart. The words spoken are just a few words concluded after repeated thinking, so they seem simple and straightforward. The ancients had the saying "rejoice when you hear your faults." In the criticism articles I saw last year, I still could not be completely convinced and sincerely accept every article in every place. So, is there any resistance? Yes, but I finally overcame it. There are always new stimuli, and the resistance continues to rise and fall. But because the power to overcome it positively is also constantly rising and strengthening, in the final analysis, it cannot be overcome. Only by overcoming it, then, it will not be considered "insincere."
    Now I want to talk about how it was finally overcome.
    First, I asked myself whether I had been wrong in my thinking and actions in the past many years. I nodded to myself, it was wrong; since it was wrong, what else is there to say? Did I have to say: my mistake is not like what you said, not so serious? That's too boring! If you don't go to the root of your mistakes and take responsibility for yourself, but resist criticism, you are really incorrigible!
    Speaking of this, I want to talk about my own understanding of my mistakes.
    Where exactly am I wrong? I have pointed it out clearly several times in the past. It is only in one place, a most fundamental place, that is, on the issue of class. In the past, I excessively emphasized the particularity of China, consistently refused to look at Chinese society with a class perspective, and refused to solve Chinese problems through class struggle. I fully believed that I was above class, but in reality, I was standing in the nest of that reactionary class. In this way, for many years, I was actually doing counter-revolutionary things, but I thought I was revolutionary, and I even used this to call on people. This is very different from those who are not revolutionary, or simply counter-revolutionary. It is obstructing the revolution, hindering the revolution, and on the surface it does not seem reactionary enough, but in fact, the counter-revolutionary force is greater and stronger, and the problem is much more serious. Therefore, although many places in the articles criticizing me do not fully conform to the past facts, and sometimes I seem to be unconvinced, I have long since had no need to be unconvinced. Being unconvinced in my heart means that I am not enlightened, not promising!
    Overcoming is first of all overcoming in this way. There is also a second.
    Second, it is necessary to separate today's me from the past me. Today's me should not be entangled with the past me. This is also because I realize that the matter of class stand is real, and I understand that it is necessary to separate. In the past, I did not believe much in the so-called class stand. I did not distinguish people from different classes, but only distinguished them from their different beliefs and opinions. I looked at the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, myself, and even everyone else only from the differences in their opinions and tendencies, and never thought there was any class distinction. Today, we all understand that if we do not stand on the side of the people, we stand on the side of the anti-people, and we will be the enemy of the people. But I didn't understand this before, I didn't believe this. On the eve of liberation, when the Communist Party of China called for the convening of the New Political Consultative Conference, that is, the People's Political Consultative Conference, I actually wrote a letter to Chairman Mao saying, please forgive me for not participating. Even after the national liberation, in 1950, after I arrived in Beijing, the leaders invited me to be a specially invited representative, but my initial answer was still that it was best not to put me in it, and leave me outside! Leave me outside? Wasn't that leaving me outside the people? Isn't this a joke! However, what seems funny today is exactly what I did five years ago. Since understanding the principle of class stand and realizing my past mistakes, I have naturally turned to the people's stand and refused to stand on the side of the anti-people. I dare not say that today's stand has been firmly established, but in consciousness, I always want to separate today's me from the past me. In that case, why does today's me have resistance because the past me is being criticized? If today I stand up to defend the past, wouldn't I be turning back again? This is not possible.
    This is the second. Let's talk about the third.
    Third, I slowly understood that my past reactionary actions were hateful. When I first realized that the past was wrong, I just knew it, and there was only a difference in consciousness before and after. It is not so easy to change the position. This can be seen from my lack of regret and disgust for my past reactionary actions. If you say that what you did in the past was wrong, reactionary, and sinful, do you admit it? When I said it, I admitted it, but I didn't feel guilty and didn't hate it enough. If I really stood on the people's stand, how could I be like this? However, living in the people's country, I can be enlightened and educated everywhere and at any time, and the old position will slowly change. It can be said that the living process in the past few years after liberation is the process of my understanding of mistakes gradually deepening. There are two things last year that can be mentioned.
    One is accidentally seeing the book "Gorky on America." Fifty years ago—in 1906, when Gorky first arrived in America, many journalists and such people gathered to welcome him. He said a lot to them, but it was almost scolding them. He said that you intellectuals eat with capitalists and serve capitalists. It seems that you have not directly done anything wrong, but you are helping to maintain this sinful abyss—the situation of capitalist society. The general idea is like this, I can't remember the original words. From his words, we deeply realized his compassion and hatred for American capitalist society. It was precisely because of his full of compassion and hatred that he did not have any polite formalities towards them. I couldn't help but think of myself, wasn't I also helping to maintain a certain sinful situation in the past? In the eyes of people who truly demand revolution, how annoying and hateful I am! Realizing this, suddenly a feeling of shame and disgust appeared in my heart. At this time, all the psychological resistance to criticism disappeared, and there was no need to overcome it.
    Another time, I watched the movie "Song of the Storm." Just when I was watching it, the atmosphere of anti-exploitation and revolution seemed to infect me and correspond with it. At this time, I also realized how annoying it was for me to hinder the revolution before. At this time, where is the heart of resisting criticism?
    I said earlier that there are always new stimuli, and the resistance is constantly aroused, but the power to overcome it positively is also constantly rising and strengthening, which refers to these, and not just these, there is also the fourth.
    Fourth, since the Communist Party has led the country, our achievements have been too great. The domestic construction is progressing rapidly, the foreign diplomacy and military glory are victorious, and the international prestige is increasing day by day, all of which have never happened before, and even were not expected, which makes people excited and moved to tears. This is the attractive and inspiring power is too great. It makes your mind suddenly open, vigorous, forget all the trivial personal matters; makes you love the motherland, love the government, strengthen the feeling of unity, and forget each other. These things are always in front of you, and new plans (five-year construction, transforming the Yellow River, etc.), new harvests, new victories (on-the-spot experiences in Gansu, the great victory of national socialistization today, etc.), emerge one after another, and are cheering and inspiring you. Who doesn't want to join the ranks and move forward with everyone! Under this great call and encouragement, I cannot have other feelings, only willingly do my best to support all the movements advocated by the government—including the movement to criticize my thoughts, so that all undertakings can proceed more smoothly.
    All these words are to explain myself, knowing that there are still many shortcomings. I hope my CPPCC colleagues will not hesitate to give me advice!

专栏：

    梁漱溟的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，我亦非常同意李副主席、郭副主席、陈副主席、董副主席和陈伯达同志先后的5个报告。所有这些报告都应该由大会作出决议，把它作为我们的指针。这两天来，许多位同志都有很好的发言，使人感动，使人振奋，见出了人心的团结一致。我在这里亦必须说几句话。
    大家都知道，在全国出现了社会主义革命的高潮之前，全国人民代表大会代表和政协全国委员会委员都出去到全国各地视察，我亦曾随着政协同人去到了甘肃省。在那里约有50天，对于农工商各业都在向着社会主义前进的途程中怎样前进，是亲自看到一些的。我看到兰州市私营工商业的社会主义改造和手工业的合作化，看到榆中县、皋兰县各处的农业合作化。就我所看到的来说，私营工商业的改造和手工业的合作化是稳步前进的——前进的不慢，可是很稳。农业方面呢，进展的好像太猛，然而至少基本上是健康的。在座的大家同人都是关心我们的社会主义事业的，假如各位因为没有去那里看过而问我说：你看了觉得怎样？我将说：我很满意。关于甘肃省的一切视察工作，我们一同去视察的三个人已经做了书面报告，有几万字，不预备在这里说。我只把农业合作化问题再说两句，使我上面的话，不致太笼统。上面所说农业合作化的进展好像太猛的话是怎么来的呢？因为在榆中、在甘肃原来参加合作组织的农户只不过农户总数的20％左右，而现在提高到80％以上接近90％了；这不是好像太猛了吗？但为什么上面说它是健康的发展呢？因为我们在各处视察中，还没有粗制滥造的印象；相反的倒看见一些工作细致不苟的情形；在整个视察过程中，我们没有发现什么问题。也许个人能力太差，时间有限，不够来发现问题的。然而这难道不可以说它基本上是很健康的吗？
    何以这样说呢？因为我联想起来那天周总理政治报告中的一段话，亦联想起几年来毛主席迭次给我的指教。政治报告中讲到知识分子的改造一段话，曾说要通过三个互相联系的途径，这就是要通过社会生活的观察和实践，要通过自己业务的实践，要通过马克思列宁主义的理论学习。像出去作实地视察，不正是那头一层吗？通过社会生活的观察和实践，最能使旧知识分子思想转变。周总理在党中央召开的会议上所做关于知识分子的报告内说得更充分更详细，试取来参看就明白。领导党和毛主席一向是着重这一点的。我自己算计，从1950年春天到北京起，以至51、52这两三年内，主席总是指教我要出去多多接触实际，耳提面命先后共有四次之多。有的我接受而出去了；有的迟之又久而后接受；有的竟不接受。特别是52年夏天主席要我出去作社会调查，我竟没有接受。在这次视察收到接触实际的效果后，才体会到主席的用心，深深抱恨自己过去是太辜负主席爱厚之意了！所以这次视察，在多数代表和委员们是可以起很多作用的，在我怕谈不上，只要收到一些自我改造之功，亦就算完成任务。
    去年（1955年）一年从1月到12月各方面曾对我展开思想批判运动，我在这种运动中感受如何、反应如何，我应当在这里说一说。因为政协是统一战线的组织形式，它要紧就在作全国团结工夫。不论它是一个人的事情或者也正是大家所关心的，我应当向领导以及各方面朋友坦白地说出来。
    去年一年对我的思想批判除了见于报纸和杂志所刊载的而外，还曾在科学院开过几次座谈会。在报纸杂志上，我还没有作过任何表示，只在一次座谈会上，我曾表示我拥护这一批判运动。当时郭沫若先生说，他对我说的话是否“由衷之言”要打个问号。他这一问问得很好，现在我就从这里说起。
    我表示欢迎各方对我的批判，拥护这一次批判我的运动，郭沫若先生要打问号那就是说：你内心里真是这样吗？怕不见得！对的，我内心里并不像口里那样简单直捷。内心是有矛盾有斗争的。说出来的话，只是反复思索后归结下来的几句话，就显得简单直捷而已。古人有“闻过则喜”的话，我在去年看到的各篇批判文章，还不能每一篇的每一处都心悦诚服。那么，有没有抗拒心理呢？有的，不过终于克服了它。时时有新的刺激，抗拒心理亦不断下去又起来。可是因为正面克服它的力量亦不断起来而且增强，所以归根结柢还是没有不能克服的。唯其克服了它，那么，就不算“言不由衷”吧。
    现在就是要说一说，它是怎样终于被克服的。
    第一，就是自己问自己，在过去多年来从思想到行动是不是错了。自己点头，是错了；既然是错了，还有什么话说？难道要说：我错的还不是像你们说的那样子，还没有那样厉害？这个话说出来，太没意思了！不向自己错处去追根究源，自己对自己负责任；却抗拒批评，真是不堪造就！
    说到这里，要说出我对自己错误的认识。
    我自己究竟错在什么地方？过去有几次亦已经明白点出了。这要紧只在一个地方，一个最根本的地方，那就是在阶级问题上。过去我过分强调中国的特殊性，一贯地拒绝以阶级眼光看中国社会，以阶级斗争来解决中国问题，满相信自己超身在阶级外，原来恰是站在具有反动性的那种阶级窝臼中。这样，多少年来就实际在作着反革命的事，却自以为是革命，还以此号召于人。这比之于不革命的，或者简简单单反革命的，所起的作用大不相同。它在阻挠着革命，妨害着革命，表面上还好像不够反动而其实反动力更大更强，问题严重多多。因此，尽管有的文章对我批判的许多地方与过去事实不尽相符，心里有时似乎还不服气，而早已用不着什么不服气了。心里不服气，那就是没觉悟，没出息！
    克服首先就是这样克服的。还有第二。
    第二，就是要把今天的我和过去的我分开。今天的我不要纠缠到过去的我。这亦是在认识到阶级立场这回事是真有其事，才懂得要分开的。过去我不大信所谓阶级立场的话，不从阶级不同来分别人，只从各自信念主张的不同来分别他。把国民党同共产党同自己乃至其他一切人都只从其主张趋向不同那地方来看，绝不认为有什么阶级的区分。像今天我们都懂得不站在人民一边，就站在反人民一边，就会是人民的公敌。而我从前却不懂这个，不信这个。当解放前夕，中国共产党号召开新政协，亦即人民政协，我竟然写信给毛主席说，请恕我不来参加。甚至全国解放了，1950年我到京后，领导上又复邀我作特邀代表，而我最初回答仍然是说最好不必摆我在里面，把我留在外边吧！留在外边？不是留在人民外边了吗？这岂不是笑话！然而在今天看起来好笑的事情，正是五年前我所做的事。自从懂得阶级立场的道理，晓得自己过去错误之后，当然转归到人民立场上来，不肯站在反人民的那一边。说今天立场已经站稳是不敢的，但在意识上总要把今天的我与过去的我分开来。既然这样，那为什么今天的我又因过去的我受人批判而起抗拒心呢？假如今天为过去的事而起来分辩的话，不是又转回头去了吗？这不可以。
    这就是第二。再说到第三。
    第三，就是慢慢懂得过去自己的反动行径是可憎恨的。初初明白过去是错误的时候，亦不过晓得了就是了，亦不过意识上前后有分别罢了。要立场转变过来，真不那么容易。这从自己对过去的反动行径悔恨憎恶不够上来看就是一个证明。说你过去那样做法都错了，都是反动，都是罪恶，你承认不承认？说起来亦承认，只是麻麻木木不起罪恶之感，对它憎恨不够。果真站到人民立场上来，岂能如此。然而生活在人民的国家里随处随时都可能给我以启发教育，旧立场还是慢慢会变的。可以说解放后几年的生活过程，整个就是我认识错误逐渐深入的过程。去年有两件事可以拿来说一说。
    一是偶然看到“高尔基论美国”一书。在距今50年前——1906年高尔基初到美国去，许多新闻记者以及如此之类的人集会欢迎他。他对他们说了许多话，却几乎就是痛骂他们一顿。说你们这些知识分子靠资本家吃饭，为资本家服务，好像也没有直接为非作恶，但你们却帮助着维持这罪恶的渊?——资本主义社会的局面。大意如此吧，原词记不得。从他的话里让我们深深领会到他对美国资本主义社会的哀矜和痛恨。正由于他满腹的哀矜痛恨之情，使得他对他们就没有什么虚文客套。不禁让我联想到自己身上，自己过去不亦是帮助了某种罪恶局面的维持吗？在革命要求真切的人看我，多么讨厌，多么可恨！体会到此，猛然间一种愧耻憎恶感情映现到心上来。此时一切抗拒批判的心理就消逝不见，不待克服了。
    又一次，是看了“激流之歌”的电影。就在看的时候，它那种反剥削、要革命的感情气氛好像传染到自己身上来，与它相应和。这时亦就领悟到自己以前那种阻碍着革命，多么招人愤恨。到此时那里还有抗拒批判的心？
    前面说，时时有新刺激，抗拒心理不断地引起，可是正面克服它的力量亦不断起来增强，就是指这些，而不仅仅指这些，还有第四。
    第四，就是自从共产党领导建国以来，我们的成就是太大了。国内建设进步一日千里，国外外交军事光荣胜利，国际威望日隆，都是从来没有的事情，甚至是原来不敢期望的事情，令人兴奋感动的落泪。就是这个吸引人鼓舞人的力量太大了。它使你心胸顿然开阔、奋发、忘记一切琐琐碎碎支支节节的个人私事；使你热爱祖国，热爱政府，团结的感情加强，泯忘了彼此。这些事情既时时在你眼前，而新的规划（五年建设、改造黄河等等）、新的收获、新的胜利（甘肃的实地见闻，今天全国社会主义化的伟大胜利等等），继起迭出，又在欢欣鼓舞着你，谁不想投身在行列之中，随到大家一堆往前走！就在这种伟大的感召鼓舞之下，我不可能有别的心情，只有甘心情愿尽力拥护政府所倡导的一切运动——包含批判我的思想运动在内，让一切事业进行得更顺遂。
    以上这些话都是在说明我自己，深知自己不够之处还是很多的。希望政协同人不吝指教！
