    Fu Baoshi's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I am extremely honored and excited to attend this meeting, and I have listened to Chairman Zhou Enlai's "Political Report," Vice Chairman Li Jishen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's "The Mission of Intellectuals in the High Tide of Socialist Revolution," Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's "Report on the Socialist Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce," Vice Chairman Dong Biwu's "Report on the Elimination of All Counter-Revolutionary Elements," and Committee Member Chen Boda's "The Socialist Transformation of Chinese Agriculture." I sincerely endorse these reports, and I guarantee to study them well and deeply, and to do everything possible to transform myself through labor, improve myself, and in the great socialist construction, to serve the people more and better.
    I am an art educator and a fine art worker—a traditional Chinese painting worker. For a long time, I have had the most contact and closest association with friends in the art world, including friends who work in traditional Chinese painting. Therefore, it is very natural that I have a relatively close and familiar understanding of issues in fine arts, especially traditional Chinese painting and traditional Chinese painters. This time in Beijing, I have also had the opportunity to talk with many comrades about issues related to traditional Chinese painting and traditional Chinese painters, and to exchange some opinions. Now, I will simply reflect on the issues related to traditional Chinese painters that we have encountered.
    The care, respect, and encouragement that our Party and government have shown to traditional Chinese painters are unprecedented and unsurpassed. Mr. Qi Baishi, who enjoys world honors, is the glorious symbol of traditional Chinese painters in New China. Seven or eight of them are participating in this conference (including those in Beijing and those from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Chongqing, and Nanjing). A few days ago, Premier Zhou's "Report on the Question of Intellectuals," published in the People's Daily on January 30, also clearly instructed that we should find ways to solve the problem of the living conditions of traditional Chinese painters who are not within the scope of state employees. I believe that when traditional Chinese painters across the country read Premier's report, they will feel as infinitely inspired and infinitely moved as I do.
    We have roughly estimated that there are about eight or nine hundred traditional Chinese painting workers with a certain level of artistic skill across the country. The vast majority are concentrated in Beijing and Shanghai, with others scattered throughout the country. Among these people, some are engaged in teaching in schools, some are engaged in other work, and a considerable number do not have fixed jobs. Generally speaking, their lives are relatively difficult. Because of this, some have changed careers, more have laid down their brushes, and there is a widespread sense of pessimism. From the perspective of inheriting and developing the excellent traditions of national painting, although some individuals among them are not comprehensive masters of excellent traditional techniques, it is undeniable that if they were brought together to give full play to their strengths and constantly improve, they would form a strong foundation for the future development of traditional Chinese painting. From the perspective of fully mobilizing and leveraging the existing strength of intellectuals, they possess a considerable degree of professional knowledge and skills (many of whom have specialized research and expertise). We propose that some of them can engage in traditional Chinese painting teaching; some can engage in the sorting out and research of painting heritage (both visual and documentary); some can continue to engage in creation, constantly seeking transformation and improvement through practice; some can engage in the reproduction and processing of painting heritage; and some can engage in the decoration and processing of工艺 products. Because these aspects of work are already felt to be urgently needed.
    The first year or two after liberation was a period of uncertainty for most traditional Chinese painters. Traditional Chinese painting courses in national art colleges (except for the Fine Arts Department of Nanjing Normal College) were generally streamlined, and some local literary and art organizations and art activities did not consider widely exploring this strength to unite, educate, and transform it, thereby expanding the ranks of fine arts workers. Some of the arrangements and requirements for creative tasks often deviated from the characteristics and actual professional level of traditional Chinese painting and traditional Chinese painters. More prominently, the living problems of some traditional Chinese painters have not been adequately resolved, although the government has continuously taken many specific measures in this regard (especially in Beijing and Shanghai) in various ways.
    We believe that the main responsibility still lies with us traditional Chinese painters ourselves. Indeed, including myself, traditional Chinese painters are relatively old, and we have lived in the old society for a relatively long time. It is undeniable that many shortcomings of old intellectuals, especially the shortcomings of arrogance and sectarian tendencies, are more concentratedly and prominently manifested in the ideological consciousness and words and actions of these people. The ancients said, "Writers despise each other, it has always been the case," and I think "painters despise each other" (mainly traditional Chinese painters) is by no means inferior. For example, the older generation looks down on the younger generation, and peers do not necessarily look favorably on each other; those who paint flowers and birds rarely like landscapes, and it is difficult for those who paint meticulous paintings to be fond of freehand brushwork. As such, various unprincipled disputes have formed, coupled with "apprenticeship" and "fraternity," creating confusion, giving people a very unpleasant impression, hindering unity, and hindering the improvement and development of traditional Chinese painting. We must be determined to overcome these serious shortcomings resolutely and quickly.
    We should also mention that the enlightenment and education of traditional Chinese painters through the great and glorious construction achievements of the motherland in recent years, thereby making traditional Chinese painters consciously strive for transformation, is also a very significant fact. Although some traditional Chinese painters do not have fixed jobs and do not have regular learning opportunities, from the mass activities in recent years, they have actively responded to the government's call to varying degrees and expressed their determination to transform themselves. Reflected in the paintings, both the theme and the form have undergone gratifying changes (for example, the traditional Chinese paintings exhibited at the Second National Art Exhibition last year can prove this). We deeply know that the mastery of an artistic technique is the result of continuous accumulation through hard study and practice over a long period of time. For painters, this is the painter's so-called "capital." Once they have to discount it from their own hands, or even abandon some useless parts, it is really not an easy thing, and it requires great courage and determination. And many of our elderly and famous traditional Chinese painters have gladly done so in order to seek artistic transformation and better serve the people. For example, several famous landscape painters and flower-and-bird painters in Shanghai went to Zhenjiang in 1954 to depict the heroic struggle of the working people and floods, and many famous traditional Chinese painters in Beijing have gone to famous mountains and rivers or construction sites more than once to experience life and create, and have gained a lot. There is no doubt that everything in New China has supported and encouraged the creative enthusiasm of traditional Chinese painters. We believe that this enthusiasm of traditional Chinese painters is most precious. I clearly remember that in his inscription for the Shanghai Chinese Painting Exhibition in August 1953, Vice Premier Chen Yi first affirmed these transformations of traditional Chinese painters. Although it is still "half-baked," it is an important start. This extremely moving inscription not only gave great support and encouragement to traditional Chinese painters across the country. After the "Liberation Daily" in Shanghai published it, I heard that the price of traditional Chinese painting pigments at the "Lao Jiang Si Xu Tang" in Suzhou immediately rose.
    We have firm confidence that the problem of the living conditions of traditional Chinese painters who are not within the scope of state employees will certainly be appropriately resolved in the near future. Today, the remaining question is how we ourselves can accelerate our preparations, from ideological preparation to brush, ink, paper, and inkstone, how we can devote ourselves to courageous and diligent progress, strive to practice, accelerate transformation, and, as Vice Chairman Guo Moruo pointed out in his report, "contribute all our useful knowledge unreservedly and unsparingly to our great motherland," which is also to repay the Party and government's sincere expectations and deep concern for our traditional Chinese painting workers.
    In order to assist in the smooth resolution of the problems of traditional Chinese painters, I would like to suggest that fine arts workers, especially traditional Chinese painting workers, who are now working in various schools, units, and at all levels of literary and art organizations, quickly report the traditional Chinese painters they know and their situations in detail to the relevant parties. If conditions permit, they should take the initiative to visit the traditional Chinese painters they are familiar with and convey the kindness of the Party and government in gentle terms. According to my past superficial experience in my work, these bridge-building contact work is needed. Because some traditional Chinese painters have long changed careers, some traditional Chinese painters no longer play this tune, and their brushes and inkstones have been abandoned for a long time, and there are also very few traditional Chinese painters with some strange temperaments, and once or twice, they will be "speechless." This is something to pay attention to in the work, and it is also our responsibility. I guarantee to do it diligently and responsibly.
    The above are just a few immature views. Please correct me if they are not correct.
    Finally, I wish the conference a complete success, and wish all leaders, committee members, and comrades good health.

    傅抱石的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我万分光荣万分兴奋地出席了这次会议，听到了周恩来主席所作的“政治报告”李济深副主席所作的“中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”、郭沫若副主席所作的“在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命”的报告、陈叔通副主席所作的“关于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造问题的报告”、董必武副主席所作的“关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告”和陈伯达委员所作的“中国农业的社会主义改造”的报告。掬诚拥护这几个报告，保证好好地深入地学习这几个报告，并尽一切可能尽的力量，从劳动中改造自己，提高自己，在伟大的社会主义建设中，能更多更好地为人民服务。
    我是一个艺术教育工作者，又是一个美术工作——国画工作者。长期以来，接触最多的，过从最密的，是美术界的朋友，其中也包括国画工作的朋友。因此，就极其自然地对美术方面的问题，特别是对国画及国画家的问题体会的比较亲切，也比较熟悉。这次来京，又有机会和许多同志谈到有关国画及国画家的问题，交换过一些意见。现在只把我们接触到的有关国画家的问题，作一个简单的反映。
    我们的党和政府对国画家的关怀、尊重和鼓励，是史无前例、无以复加的。享受世界荣誉的齐白石老先生，就是新中国国画家们的光荣标志。参加这次大会的就有七、八位（包括在北京的和来自上海、杭州、重庆、南京的）。前几天，1月30日人民日报发表的周总理“关于知识分子问题的报告”中，还明确地指示了要设法解决不属于国家工作人员范围的国画家的生活待遇问题。相信全国的国画家们读到总理这个报告的时候，和我一样会感到无限的振奋和无限的感动。
    我们曾经粗粗地估计了一下，全国范围内掌握了一定的艺术水平的国画工作者，大约有八九百人。绝大部分集中在北京和上海，此外散处各地。这些人中，部分的担任了学校的教学工作，部分的担任了别的工作，相当多的一部分则没有固定的工作，一般说，生活是比较窘的。因此之故，部分的改了行，更多的搁了笔，普遍地存在一种消极的情绪。作为继承并发展民族绘画的优秀传统来看，他们之中的某些个人虽不是优秀传统技法的全面掌握者，不可否认，若他们集中起来各抒所长不断提高的话，必将形成将来国画发展的有力基础。作为充分地动员和发挥现有的知识分子的力量来看，他们在一定程度上具有相当的专业知识和技术（其中不少具有专门的研究和专长的技巧）。我们拟建议：他们之中有的可从事国画教学工作；有的可以从事绘画遗产（形象的和文献的）的整理、研究工作；有的可以继续从事创作，从实践中不断求得改造和提高；有的可以从事绘画遗产的复制、加工的工作；还有的可以从事工艺产品的装饰、加工的工作。因为这几方面的工作，已经感觉有迫切需要了。
    解放初期的一、二年，是多数国画家们感到彷徨的一段时期。全国艺术院校（除南京师范学院美术系）的国画课程，普遍精简了，有的地方文艺组织和美术活动没有考虑广泛地发掘这份力量，进行团结、教育和改造，从而扩大美术工作的队伍。有的某些创作任务的布置和要求，往往又脱离了国画和国画家们的特征和业务的实际水平。而较突出的，则是部分国画家们的生活问题没有得到适当的解决，虽然政府在这方面（特别在北京、在上海）曾经不断地采取各种方式进行过许多具体的措施。
    我们认为，主要的责任还在我们国画家们自己身上。诚然，包括我自己，国画家们的年纪都比较大些，生活在旧社会的时期也比较长久些，不可讳言，旧知识分子的许多缺点，尤其是自高自大和宗派倾向的缺点，更集中地、突出地表现在我们这些人的思想意识和言语行动上。古人说过：“文人相轻，自古皆然”，而“画人相轻”（主要是国画家）我看也决无逊色的。例如：老一辈的看年青的不起，同辈的也未必看得上眼；画花鸟的很少喜欢山水，画工笔的对写意却很难引起好感。既然如此，就形成了种种无原则的纠纷，加上“拜师”“同门”，搞个不清，给人以极不愉快的印象，妨碍了团结，也阻碍了国画的提高和发展。我们必须痛下决心，赶快把这些严重的缺点坚决予以克服。
    我们也应该提起：通过祖国几年来伟大的辉煌的建设成就对国画家们的启发和教育，从而使国画家们自觉地努力要求改造，也是很显著的事实。尽管部分的国画家还没有固定的工作，没有经常的学习机会，然从几年来群众性的活动来看，在不同程度上他们都积极响应了政府的号召，表示了自我改造的决心。反映在画面上，从主题到形式，都起着可喜的变化（例如去年二届全国美展的国画出品，可以证明）。我们深深知道：一种艺术技巧的掌握，是从漫长时期的创作实践中苦学苦炼不断累积的结果。对于画家们说来，这就是画家的所谓“本钱”。一旦要从自己的手里将它打个折扣，甚至还要抛弃没有用的一部分，这实在不是一件容易的事情，是需要极大的勇气和决心的。而我们竟有不少的高龄的著名国画家为了求得艺术上的改造更好地为人民服务，他们欣然地这样做了。例如上海几位著名的山水画家和花鸟画家，1954年到镇江一带描写过劳动人民和洪水的英勇斗争，北京许多著名的国画家，不只一次地去到名山大川或基建工地体验生活，进行创作，都得到很大的收获。毫无疑问，这是新中国的一切，支持和鼓励了国画家们的创作热情。我们认为国画家们的这种热情是最堪珍贵的。清楚记得陈毅副总理1953年8月参观了上海国画展览的题辞中，首先就肯定了国画家们的这些转变，虽然还不免是“夹生饭”，却是一个重要的开始。这篇极其动人的题辞，不但给全国国画家们以极大的支持和鼓励。上海“解放日报”发表之后，听说，苏州“老姜思序堂”的国画颜料就立刻涨价。
    我们有坚强的信心，相信在为期不远的时期内不属于国家工作人员范围的国画家的生活待遇问题一定能够得到适当的解决。今天剩下的问题，倒是我们自己怎样加紧的准备起来，从思想准备一直到笔墨纸砚，怎样殚精竭虑地勇猛精进，努力实践，加速改造，像郭沫若副主席报告中所指出的“把自己一切有用的知识，无保留地不吝惜地贡献给我们伟大的祖国”，也是报答党和政府对我们国画工作者殷切的期待和深厚的关怀。
    为了协助国画家问题的顺利解决，我想建议现在在各学校、各单位和在各级文艺组织工作的美术工作者同志们，特别是国画工作者同志们，赶快把所知道的国画家及其情况向有关方面作详尽的反映，如有条件，应该主动地去访问你所熟悉的国画家，把党和政府的厚意婉言转达。据我过去工作中一点点肤浅的体会，是需要这些桥梁性的联系工作的。因为有些国画家早改了行业，有些国画家此调不弹，笔墨久荒，还有极个别的国画家有些怪脾气，一次两次，会“相对无言”的。这是工作中值得注意的地方，也是我们应尽的责任。我保证努力的负责的去做。
    以上仅是几点不成熟的看法，是否正确，敬请指教。
    最后，敬祝大会胜利成功，各位首长，各位委员，各位同志身体健康。
