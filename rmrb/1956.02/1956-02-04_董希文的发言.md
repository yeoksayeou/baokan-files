Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report on "The Mission of Intellectuals in the High Tide of Socialist Revolution," I feel very excited and express my warm support here.

The current domestic situation has undergone a fundamental change. Everyone clearly sees the great future of their country, but at the same time, they immediately think about how their work can be coordinated with the tremendous development of the socialist cause.

The achievements of fine arts creation in the past six years have lagged far behind the needs of the overall national development. Both the quantity and quality of works cannot meet the growing and improving demands of the broad masses for new cultural life. The task before us painters is to strive to exert all the power of fine arts creation to catch up. Of course, this requires painters to work hard to improve their ideological and artistic level under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, master realistic creation methods, diligently observe life, and devote tenacious labor to their creation practice. In addition, I also believe that there are indeed many complex reasons that limit painters from fully exploiting their creative potential.

First, the number of painters with special talents in the country is small. Like other senior intellectuals, painters have a lot of administrative work, heavy teaching tasks, and excessive part-time jobs and social activities. These painters feel that they are always entangled in non-business work every day, so that the time for creation and preparation for creation is taken up. Some painters don't even have time to experience life for a short time; others, although they have experienced life and returned, have to put their creations aside because they are busy with other things, and what they feel in life will fade over time. Therefore, many painters simply do not engage in creation, but they are depressed, which affects their work. Creation requires a high degree of concentration and continuity of thinking, but in general, during the conception and production process, due to the dispersion of time and energy, it is often interrupted repeatedly. When you go back to do it again, you have to rethink and start all over again. This wastes time, and the effect of the work is poor.

Speaking of the particularity of professors at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, they are both professors and painters. We have two responsibilities to the people: teaching and creation. If we can't produce creations, we can't meet the needs of the people, and teaching will be difficult to improve. Creation is both a teaching demonstration and an important part of scientific research. We must take care of the interdependent development of these two aspects.

In order to ensure that painters with special talents have time to create, the Academy of Fine Arts must increase manpower, and the quota cannot be based on the general establishment regulations. I agree with the suggestion of some comrades that vice posts should be added to the positions held by some painters so that they can have creative vacations or regularly rotate off their posts to carry out creation and life practice. It is impossible to solve the problem if these painters only have ten hours a week to engage in business. They need a longer time to delve into life before they can create. Here, I would also like to emphasize that good painters in the society should teach part-time at art schools and jointly shoulder the responsibility of cultivating young people. In order to enable painters who hold teaching positions in art schools to expand their scope of life and exchange teaching experience, I think it is also a good way for various art schools to regularly exchange professors. In short, these issues require the leadership of the art world to make comprehensive plans in the future, adjust the rational allocation of these painters' work and creation time, so that painters with special talents can fully exert their strength in creation.

Painters should have appropriate studios. It is unreasonable to allocate houses only according to the population without considering the characteristics and needs of the work. I suggest that the Chinese Artists Association first build many studios. The supply of fine arts supplies should be strengthened accordingly. Other issues, such as the fact that the remuneration for fine arts works is lower than that of text, are also a problem.

Second, there is a lack of fine arts talents at present, which is far from being able to keep up with the needs of the widespread development of the fine arts industry. In the future, a large number of young painters will be trained and promoted, which has become a very urgent issue. Art schools should increase the number of enrollments, send more students to study in the Soviet Union, and strengthen the training of cadres' transfers. Many art workers across the country are eager to master technology, which is their legitimate demand, and they should not be simply labeled with the hat of "pure technical viewpoint." The tendency of art workers to ignore politics should be corrected, but it is also wrong for leaders to only pay attention to political leadership and not to professional leadership. Whether students can improve quickly depends on whether they can study seriously, but in the past, the teaching methods of the Academy of Fine Arts were accustomed to separating teaching from the creation of professors. The creation of professors was only their own business. In the future, if professors can choose some students to be his assistants in his creations under appropriate circumstances, not only will the creation efficiency increase, but also the experience will be directly passed on to the students from the professor's creation practice, which will be better than general guidance only in the classroom.

Third, we should pay attention to traditional Chinese painting. The ideological essence of discriminating against traditional Chinese painting is the lack of national self-esteem. The Party's policy of inheriting and carrying forward the excellent traditions of national heritage is affirmative, but we in the art world have not done enough in the past. At present, there are still more than 100 people in the traditional Chinese painting circles in Beijing who do not have a profession. Some are painting palace lanterns and bookmarks, but the wages are too low, and must be improved quickly. In the future, organizing traditional Chinese painters to study politics, improve artistic accomplishment, face life, often sketch, engage in creation, organize production, and improve treatment should be one of the central tasks of the Artists Association. In addition, traditional Chinese painters and oil painters should establish a more organized relationship of mutual learning in the future. The history of Chinese oil painting is still short, and we urgently need to learn from the Soviet Union, but on the other hand, we should also encourage oil painters to be active and creative in how to promote national style in oil painting.

Fine arts creation requires profound thoughts, deep immersion in life, expression through images, and tenacious labor. Since ancient times, no painter's success has been easily obtained. I firmly believe that under the Party's constant concern and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, our painters will strive to improve their cognitive and expressive abilities and tenaciously engage in creative practice, so that our fine arts creation career will be greatly prosperous and improved in socialist construction. Chinese painters will surely be able to catch up with the world's advanced level and release the brilliance of national painting!

    董希文的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听了周恩来主席的政治报告和郭沫若副主席的“在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命”的报告以后，感到非常的兴奋，在这里表示热烈的拥护。
    目前国内的情况已经起了一个根本性质的变化。每一个人都清楚地看到了自己国家的伟大前途，但同时也马上使自己想到所从事的工作又如何来配合社会主义事业巨大的发展。
    美术创作事业六年来的成就，到今天已经远远地落后于整个国家发展的需要，不论在作品的数量上质量上已不能满足广大人民群众对于新的文化生活日益增长和提高的要求。摆在我们画家们面前的任务是必须努力发挥美术创作中的一切力量去迎头赶上。当然，这首先需要画家在毛主席的文艺方针指导下努力提高自己的思想艺术水平，掌握现实主义创作方法，辛勤地观察生活，并付出顽强的劳动去从事自己的创作实践。另外，我也认为的确还有不少复杂的原因，是限制着画家充分地发挥创作中的潜力的。
    第一，全国有特长的画家人数少，同其他高级知识分子一样，画家的行政事务工作多，教学任务重，兼职与社会活动又过多，这些画家都感到每天总有被非业务性的工作纠缠着，以致创作和创作准备的时间被占去。有的画家连短时间体验生活的时间都没有；有的虽然体验了生活回来，但又因忙于别的，只好把创作搁起，而在生活中所感受的，日久也就冲淡了。因之不少画家干脆地不搞创作，但是心中苦闷，反而影响工作。创作需要精神的高度集中和思维的连续，但一般情况是在构思、制作过程中，由于时间精力分散，往往一再中断，回头再去搞时，又得重新想起做起，这样既浪费时间，作品效果又差。
    以中央美术学院教授的特殊性讲，又是教授，又是画家，我们对人民负教学与创作的两种责任。搞不出创作，不但不能满足人民的要求，而且教学亦难提高，创作既是教学示范，又是科学研究的一个重要部分，必须照顾这两方面互为因果的发展。
    为了保证有专长的画家有创作时间，美术学院必须增加人力，名额不能按照一般编制的规定。我同意有些同志建议，若干画家所担任的职务增添副职，使他们有创作的假期，或定期轮班离职去进行创作和生活实践。这些画家只有每周十几小时搞业务的时间是不能解决问题的，他们需要较长的时间深入生活，然后才能创作。这里我还要强调社会上好的画家应该在美术学校兼课，共同负担培养青年的责任。为了使美术学校担任教职的画家扩大他的生活范围和交流教学经验，我以为各个美术学校之间定期互换教授也是一个办法。总之，这些问题需要今后美术界领导上做出全面规划，调整这些画家工作与创作时间的合理分配，使具有专长的画家能充分地在创作中发挥力量。
    画家应有适当的画室，只按人口分配房屋而不顾工作特点和需要是不合理的。我建议中国美术家协会首先来建筑许多画室。美术用品的供应工作应当相应地加强。其他如美术作品的稿费低于文字，也是一个问题。
    第二，目前美术人才缺乏，远远地配合不上美术事业普遍发展的需要。今后大量地培养和提拔青年画家，已成为一个很迫切的问题。美术学校应增加招生名额，加派留苏学生，加强干部的调职训练。全国许多美术工作者迫切地要求掌握技术，是他们正当的要求，对他们不要简单地加上“纯技术观点”的帽子。美术工作者忽视政治的倾向应该纠正，但是领导上如果只注意政治的领导而不重业务领导的观点也是错误的。学生是否能很快地提高，需要看他们能否认真地学习，但过去美术学院的教学方法，习惯于把教学与教授的创作分开来进行，教授的创作只是自己的事。今后教授如能选择若干学生，在适当的情况下来做他创作中的助手，不单创作效率增加，而且从教授创作实践中把经验直接交给学生，会比只在教室中一般地指导要好。
    第三，国画应该引起我们的重视，歧视国画的思想实质是缺乏民族自尊心。党对于继承和发扬民族遗产的优良传统这个政策是肯定的，但过去我们美术界做得不够。目前北京的国画界还有100多人没有职业，有的在画宫灯、书签，而工资太低，必须迅速改善。今后组织国画家学习政治，提高艺术修养，面向生活，经常写生，从事创作，组织生产，改善待遇，应该做为美协中心工作之一。另外国画家和油画家今后应该更有组织的建立起互相学习的关系。中国的油画历史尚短，我们极需要努力向苏联学习，但另一方面，我们也应该鼓励油画家对于如何在油画上发扬民族风格的积极性和创造性。
    美术创作需要深刻的思想，深入生活，通过形象表现，顽强地去劳动。从古以来画家的成功，没有一个是轻而易得的。深信我们画家在党的时刻关心下，在毛主席的文艺方针指导下，努力提高自己的认识能力和表现能力，并顽强地从事创作实践，使我们的美术创作事业在社会主义建设中大大地繁荣和提高。中国的画家，一定能够赶上世界先进水平，放出民族绘画的光芒！
