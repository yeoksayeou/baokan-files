    All of Anhui Province has completed one round of rectification of the more than 62,000 newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives and the old cooperatives after expansion and merger. After this rectification, the quality of the cooperatives has generally improved. The number of poorly managed cooperatives has decreased from 12% of the total number of cooperatives to 5%.

    During the rectification process, Anhui focused on resolving issues such as establishing the leadership advantage of poor peasants within the cooperatives, implementing mutually beneficial policies, and strengthening production management. According to statistics from over 60,000 cooperatives, among the 810,000 cooperative cadres, 450,000 were poor peasants and 240,000 were lower-middle peasants, accounting for 83% in total. In the former 923 cooperatives of 7 counties including Chaoxian and Wuwei in the Wuhu area, the appraised prices for members' draught animals entering the cooperatives were slightly low, and appropriate adjustments were made during the rectification, which the members were relatively satisfied with. At the same time, all localities quickly helped the cooperatives establish production order, formulate production plans, and implement the contract work system during the rectification.

    During the rectification of agricultural cooperatives in Anhui Province, a total of more than 16,000 cadres were invested in the rectification work, and nearly 200,000 cooperative backbone members were trained. At present, all localities are continuing to carry out cooperative rectification in conjunction with spring plowing preparations. The focus of this rectification is to strengthen production management, implement the production responsibility system, and formulate production plans. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    安徽省全部农业合作社已经整顿一次
    安徽省已经全部整顿了一次62，000多个新建的农业生产合作社和扩大合并后的老社。经过这次整顿，社的质量普遍提高。办得较差的社，已经由占总社数12％下降为5％。
    安徽各地在整社过程中，着重解决了树立贫农在社内的领导优势、贯彻执行互利政策和加强生产管理等问题。据6万多个社的统计，在81万个社的干部中，有45万人是贫农，有24万人是下中农，二者共占83％。芜湖专区巢县、无为等7个县原有923个社，评定社员的耕畜入社价格稍低，在整社中都作了适当的调整，社员比较满意。同时各地在整社中都迅速地帮助合作社建立了生产秩序，制定了生产计划，并且推行了包工制。
    安徽省各地在整顿农业合作社期间，投入整社的干部共有16，000多人，并且训练了近20万名合作社的骨干分子。目前，各地又结合春耕准备工作继续开展整社。这次整社的重点是加强生产管理、推行生产责任制和订好生产计划。（据新华社讯）
