    A Brief Review of Two Philosophical Works by Cornforth

    "Science Versus Idealism" Translated by Chen Xiuzhai, Guan Qidong, and Qi Liangji, published by Sanlian Bookstore
    "In Defence of Philosophy" Translated by Qu Junong, Shu Yishang, Guo Congzhou, and Nan Xi, published by Sanlian Bookstore

    Maurice Cornforth is a famous British militant materialist. "Science Versus Idealism" and "In Defence of Philosophy" are his two powerful works criticizing bourgeois idealist philosophy, the latter being a sequel to the former. The Chinese translation of the first book was published in 1954, and the Chinese translation of the second book was published last year.

    The nature of these two books is the same, only the emphasis is slightly different. "Science Versus Idealism" mainly exposes the anti-scientific nature of subjective idealist logical positivism. Its focus is on defending science and establishing a Marxist-Leninist worldview. The first five chapters of this book describe the development of early bourgeois empiricism from materialism to idealism. Chapter Six criticizes idealist empiricism, and Chapters Seven to Thirteen criticize logical positivism. The order of criticism is from Russell to Carnap, with heavier emphasis on criticizing the latter. This school of philosophy is subjective idealism dressed in new clothes. After stripping off the new clothes, we can see that their ancestors are still Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and Mach. Russell began to put on the new clothes. This new outfit is the so-called "logical analysis." Dewey called his philosophy a "Copernican Revolution," and Russell called his philosophy a "Galilean Revolution." In the era of imperialism, bourgeois philosophers, like other merchants, were also "bragging about their own melons." In fact, their wares are all anti-scientific.

    "In Defence of Philosophy" focuses on criticizing the "philosophy" that distorts philosophy. Cornforth pays attention to propagating the correct worldview, so he expounds on dialectical materialism more positively. Chapter Two of this book explains dialectical materialism in its entirety. The title of Chapter One is "The Logic of Irrationalism"; in this chapter, the author puts forward six arguments to prove that logical positivism is not a scientific philosophy at all. This book criticizes semantics, criticizes the reactionary teachings of semantics in politics and society, criticizes pragmatism, and criticizes the confluence of logical positivism and pragmatism in "semiotics" and so-called "unified science." In the last chapter, the author summarizes the characteristics of reactionary philosophy, thereby establishing the only scientific philosophy—dialectical materialism.

    There are many advantages to these two books. The author's position is clear, his thinking is meticulous, and he hits the nail on the head in most of his criticisms of the objects he criticizes. The detailed and meticulous arguments in these two books leave a striking impression. The author is in a country where idealism dominates, and this kind of in-depth debate is especially needed.

    Our Chinese readers may pay special attention to Chapter Seven of "In Defence of Philosophy"—"Pragmatism." This chapter contains some errors, and the author has already made corrections in the New York edition preface. I think there is another point that should be discussed, that is, Cornforth did not arrange his criticism from Dewey's thorough subjective idealist empiricism. Without such an arrangement, without firmly grasping this point, the individual criticisms will waver. For example, the author feels difficulty with Dewey's so-called "crude existence" (i.e., "raw existence" in the translation). Cornforth is right to criticize Dewey's idealism from the point of view that Dewey regards knowledge as being able to create its own object, and such idealist fallacies themselves should be criticized. But how should "crude existence" be criticized? On this point, the author does not seem to have a firm opinion. Sometimes he regards "crude existence" as a Kantian thing-in-itself, and sometimes he regards it as an amorphous raw material. In fact, Dewey does not have the "crude existence" that Cornforth has in mind at all. Such existence is still within Dewey's subjective idealist experience. For those who are accustomed to English, this vocabulary does have the meaning of "there is no way to deal with it," and therefore indirectly gives people the meaning of "independent existence." The appearance of such vocabulary in Dewey's book makes his philosophy seem not so idealistic. In fact, in Dewey, "crude existence" is just an object that has not been processed by cognition and action. Such existence is already in experience. According to Dewey, what is not in experience does not exist at all. Existence is being experienced, but experience contains a great many items, and cognition is only one of them.

    Not grasping the central point mentioned above not only makes it impossible to make a thorough criticism of "crude existence," but also causes problems in other important aspects, such as Dewey's reactionary nature. Cornforth underestimates Dewey's reactionary nature, and in some issues, he lets Dewey slip away. In a review of "In Defence of Philosophy," the Soviet journal "Problems of Philosophy" stated the following regarding the statement—"Pragmatism, compared with any other bourgeois philosophy, is more free from sophistry and mysticism"—"On this point, of course, one cannot agree in any way." Dewey's sophistry is no less than that of other bourgeois philosophers, and his mysticism can only exceed them, never fall short. Dewey's opposition to science and his support of religion are two aspects of the same thing. His anti-rationalism is inseparable from his mysticism, and these are closely linked to his extremely reactionary position. Cornforth's underestimation of the reactionary nature of Dewey's philosophy also reveals a kind of incompleteness in his criticism.

    However, the advantages of this book are ultimately the main ones, and it is helpful to our current critical work, especially the guiding ideology of these two books. In addition to this, we would like to specifically point out the following two points: one is the complexity of bourgeois philosophy, and the other is its anti-rationalism.

    Cornforth has already pointed out the complexity of philosophy in Chapter Two. In addition to reflecting specific class views, imperialist philosophy is not simple either. It is a complex and indirect reflection process, mediated by the philosopher's personality, the pre-existing ideas they have received from their predecessors, the social, political, legal, and moral ideas, the progress of technological inventions and scientific discoveries, the characteristics of national development, and so on. We are currently engaged in an ideological struggle in philosophy. In order to strengthen our combat effectiveness, we must improve our scientific nature. Scientific nature is consistent with combat effectiveness. Empty criticism lacks scientific nature, so it will not have a strong combat effect; piecemeal criticism lacks combat effectiveness and also lacks true scientific value. Despite some shortcomings in these two books, some of which have already been pointed out by the author himself and in the preface to the Russian translation of the book, both of these books are worthy examples for us to learn from.

    One of the main characteristics of imperialist philosophy is anti-rationalism (I think it is not just irrationalism). Cornforth already pointed this out in Chapter One. This point is actually carried out throughout the chapters, although it is not mentioned everywhere in the text. We must pay attention, especially the old intellectuals in the philosophical circles, that open anti-rationalists such as Bergson have been criticized by Russell. In this way, Russell seems to be a rationalist, but in fact, Russell is also an anti-rationalist. We dialectical materialists want to use reason to understand the laws of the objective world, and transform the real environment according to the laws we have understood. Our actions are by no means based on instinctive impulses. However, modern bourgeois philosophers, whether they openly advocate impulses (Bergson), or openly advocate "intellect," but ultimately still rely on impulses (Russell), or use so-called "wit" to replace intellect, and openly advocate that "wit" should serve impulses (Dewey), are all defending the impulses of imperialism. Imperialists do act according to anti-rationalism, and they will inevitably run into brick walls.

    Just as Berkeley and Hume first distorted empiricism in the rising era of capitalism, and then used it to serve the bourgeoisie, in the era of imperialism, bourgeois philosophers distorted scientific theories, and then used the distorted scientific theories to serve imperialism. In the rising era of capitalism, the bourgeoisie needed science to develop production and improve productivity, but also needed idealism, obscurantism, and religious superstition to maintain its rule. Therefore, the science it needed was a science that could coexist peacefully with religious superstition. But science is materialist, and the more developed science is, the more materialism is confirmed. How can bourgeois philosophers make science and religious superstition coexist peacefully? The method of bourgeois philosophers is to replace the materialism in scientific theories with idealism. In this way, science can still be carried out (of course, it will be greatly restricted, as Cornforth has elaborated), but scientific theories can coexist with all kinds of fideism, and science and religious superstition can coexist peacefully.

    Cornforth spent five chapters in the first book describing the history of empiricism. Empiricism was originally the theory of scientific practice during the emergence and upward development of the bourgeoisie. It was originally opposed to the obscurantism of medieval scholastic philosophy, and was materialist. Bacon and Hobbes are good representatives. By the time of Locke, the objective situation had changed. The British bourgeoisie wanted to compromise with the aristocratic landlords to establish a bourgeois dictatorship, and the revolution of 1688 was brought about by this compromise. Locke's philosophy is a coexistence of materialism and idealism. But this still could not meet the later needs of the bourgeoisie. By the time of Berkeley and Hume, the materialist foundation of empiricism was removed. Empiricism was the scientific theory at the time, and removing its materialism meant removing the materialism of the scientific theory at the time. In this way, science and religion could coexist more peacefully.

    The central content of Cornforth's two books that he criticized is the history of the philosophy of bourgeois idealist philosophers in the era of imperialism who distorted scientific theories and used the distorted scientific theories. Understanding pragmatism and logical positivism from this perspective, we realize that the mainstream of imperialist idealist philosophy is the continuation of Berkeley, Hume, Kant, and Mach. The imperialist monopoly bourgeoisie increasingly needs to increase its maximum profits, needs militarism, and therefore also needs some science, but it needs even more to strengthen its oppression and deepen its exploitation, so it needs idealism and religious superstition even more. Therefore, it makes science subordinate to religion. The task of idealist philosophers who serve imperialism is the same as that of Berkeley and others, which is to distort scientific theories and make them idealistic. Science is constantly developing, and it constantly raises new questions. Therefore, idealism has to put on new clothes, and use new terms and more complicated methods to distort scientific theories. Cornforth's first book clearly describes this process. From Russell to Carnap, the materialism in scientific theories was increasingly excluded. What method did they use to exclude materialism? Berkeley used the name of empiricism to cancel its materialism, and modern idealist philosophers also use the name of science to exclude the materialism in scientific theories. In capitalist society, idealist philosophers have already distorted and utilized scientific theories to a certain extent.

    Since the May Fourth Movement, our science has also been corrupted by idealism. Older people still remember the "science" and metaphysics debate 30 years ago. On the one hand, it was a struggle within the ruling class. The metaphysics faction represented the feudal landlords, and the "science" faction represented the comprador bourgeoisie. On the other hand, they all served imperialism, opposed revolution, and opposed Marxism-Leninism. However, the "science" faction was more deceptive, first, because the "science" faction was opposing science in the guise of science. Second, the "science" faction won in that debate. The philosophy of the "science" faction is the philosophy that Cornforth criticized. It has achieved nearly 30 years of rule before liberation. In order to make our science develop and be able to shoulder the task of construction, on the one hand, we must study the Soviet Union well, and on the other hand, we must thoroughly criticize the subjective idealist philosophy of Berkeley, Mach, Russell, Dewey, and even Carnap, who are conducting anti-science in the guise of science. We must do this work quickly, work hard to do this work, establish our Marxist-Leninist worldview, and catch up with the needs of national socialist construction.

    略评康福斯的两本哲学著作
    金岳霖
    科学与唯心主义的对立　陈修斋　关其侗　齐良骥译　三联书店出版
    保卫哲学　瞿菊农　舒贻上　郭从周　南铣译　三联书店出版
    康福斯是英国著名的战斗唯物主义者。“科学与唯心主义的对立”和“保卫哲学”是他的批判资产阶级唯心哲学的两本力作，后者是前者的续篇。前一书已在1954年出版了中译本，后一书的中译本也在去年出版了。
    这两本书的性质是一样的，只是重点稍微不同而已。“科学与唯心主义的对立”主要地是揭露主观唯心论的逻辑实证论底反科学性，它的重点在于保卫科学，树立马克思列宁主义的世界观。这本书的头五章叙述了早期资产阶级的经验主义由唯物到唯心的发展，第六章批判了唯心主义的经验主义，第七章到第十三章都是批判逻辑实证论的。批判的秩序是从罗素到卡尔纳普，批判后者的分量要重些。这一派的哲学是穿上新衣服的主观唯心论，把新衣服剥掉之后，我们可以看出他们的老祖宗依然是巴克莱、休谟、康德、马赫。新衣服是罗素开始披上的。这件新衣服就是所谓“逻辑的分析”。杜威把他的哲学称为“哥伯尼的革命”，罗素把他的哲学叫作“伽利略革命”。在帝国主义时代，资产阶级的哲学家和别的商人一样，也在那里“老王卖瓜，自卖自夸”。其实，他们的货色都是反科学的。
    “保卫哲学”一书着重地批判了歪曲哲学的“哲学”。康福斯注重宣传正确的世界观，因此他正面地阐述辩证唯物论的地方要多些。本书第二章整章解释了辩证唯物论。第一章的题目是“非理性主义底逻辑”；在这一章里作者提出了六个论点来论证逻辑实证论根本不是科学的哲学。这本书批判了语义学，批判了语义学在政治和社会方面的反动说教，批判了实用主义，批判了逻辑实证论和实用主义的合流的“记号学”和所谓“统一的科学”。在最后一章作者概括了反动哲学的特征，从而树立唯一科学的哲学——辩证唯物论。
    这两本书的优点很多。作者立场鲜明，思想细致，对所批判的对象，大都打中了要害。这两本书的论证的详尽和细致，给人以突出的印象。作者处在唯心论占统治地位的国家，这种深入的辩论尤其合乎需要。
    我们中国的读者也许会特别注意“保卫哲学”第七章——“实用主义”。这一章是有些错误的，作者在纽约版序文中已经作了更正。我觉得还有一点应该提出讨论，就是康福斯没有从杜威的彻头彻尾的主观唯心论的经验论去安排他的批判。没有这样的安排，没有紧紧地抓住这一点，个别地方的批判就会摇摆不定。例如对于杜威的所谓“赤裸裸的存在”（即译本所说的“粗糙的存在”），作者就感觉到困难。康福斯是从杜威把认识看作能够制造它自己的对象这一点来批判杜威的唯心论的，这是对的，这样的唯心论的谬论本身就要加以批判。但是对“赤裸裸的存在”究竟应该如何批判呢？在这一点上作者似乎没有坚决的意见。他有时把“赤裸裸的存在”看作康德式的物自体，有时又看作无定形的原料。其实杜威根本没有康福斯心目中的“赤裸裸的存在”，这样的存在依然是在杜威的主观唯心论的经验之中的。对习惯于英文的人说，这个词汇确有“对它没有办法”的含义，因此间接地也给人以“独立存在”的含义。这样的词汇在杜威的书中出现就使他的哲学显得好像不那么唯心似的。其实，在杜威“赤裸裸的存在”只是没有经过认识和行动上的加工制作的对象而已。这样的存在已经在经验中。按照杜威的说法，不在经验中的根本就不存在，存在就是被经验，不过经验所包含的项目非常之多，认识只是经验之一而已。
    上面所说的中心点没有抓住，不仅对“赤裸裸的存在”不能作彻底的批判，别的重要的方面也发生问题，例如杜威的反动性。康福斯对杜威的反动性估计不够，在有些问题上，他就让杜威滑过去了。在评论“保卫哲学”的书评中，苏联“哲学问题”杂志针对下面的说法——“实用主义与任何其他的资产阶级哲学相比较是较多地摆脱了烦琐哲学和神秘主义的”——说道：“对于这一点，当然，无论如何也不能同意”。杜威的烦琐不亚于其他的资产阶级哲学家，他的神秘主义只有超过他们，决不能不及。杜威反对科学和他拥护宗教是一件事的两个方面，他的反理性主义是和他的神秘主义分不开的，而这些又是和他的极端的反动立场密切地结合着的。康福斯对杜威哲学的反动性估计不足，在批判中也就流露出一种不彻底性。
    但是本书的优点究竟是主要的，对于我们当前的批判工作是有帮助的，尤其是这两本书的主导思想。除此之外我们特别提出以下两点：一是资产阶级哲学的复杂性，二是它的反理性主义。
    康福斯在第二章里已经提出了哲学的复杂性。除了反映特定的阶级观点外，帝国主义哲学也不是简单的。它是复杂而间接的反映过程，居间媒介的是哲学家的个性，他们从其先行者所得到的早已存在的观念，社会的政治、法律及道德观念，技术发明和科学发现底进步，民族发展底特点等等。我们正在进行哲学上的思想斗争。为了加强我们的战斗性，我们要提高我们的科学性。科学性是和战斗性一致的。空疏的批判缺乏科学性，因此也不会有很强的战斗效果；支离琐碎的批判没有战斗性，也缺乏真正的科学价值。尽管这两本书有些毛病，作者本人和本书俄译本序言也已经指出了一些，然而这两本书都是值得我们学习的榜样。
    帝国主义哲学的主要特征之一是反理性主义（我觉得不只是非理性主义而已）。康福斯在第一章就已经提出。这一点实际上是贯彻到各章中去的，虽然在文字上没有到处都提到它。我们要注意，尤其是哲学界中的旧知识分子要注意，公开的反理性主义者例如柏格森是曾经受到罗素的批评的。这样一来，罗素就好像是理性主义者了，其实罗素也是反理性主义者。我们辩证唯物论者是要凭理性去认识客观世界的规律，并且按照所认识的规律去变革现实的环境，我们的行动决不是靠本能的冲动的。可是现代资产阶级的哲学家，无论是公开地主张冲动的也好（柏格森），或公开地主张“理智”，但是到了最后依然依靠冲动的也好（罗素），或者用所谓“机智”代替理智，公开地主张要“机智”去为冲动服务的也好（杜威），都是为帝国主义的冲动作辩护的。帝国主义者确实也是按照反理性主义去行动的，他们必然会碰得头破血流。
    正如巴克莱、休谟在资本主义上升时代先歪曲经验主义，然后利用它来为资产阶级服务，在帝国主义时代资产阶级哲学家又歪曲科学理论，然后又利用歪曲了的科学理论来为帝国主义服务。在资本主义上升时代，资产阶级需要科学来发展生产提高生产力，但是也需要唯心论，蒙昧主义，宗教迷信来维持它的统治。因此它所需要的科学是和宗教迷信相安无事的科学。但是科学是唯物论的，科学愈发达，唯物论愈得到证实。资产阶级哲学家怎样可以使科学和宗教迷信相安无事呢？资产阶级哲学家的办法是把科学理论中的唯物主义偷换成为唯心主义。这样一来，科学仍然可以进行（当然会受很大的限制，康福斯发挥了这一点），但是科学的理论就可以和各色各样的信仰主义并存，而科学和宗教迷信就可能相安无事了。
    康福斯在第一本书中花了五章的篇幅来叙述经验主义的历史。经验主义本是资产阶级发生和向上发展时期科学实践底理论。它本是反对中世纪经院哲学的蒙昧主义的，是唯物论的。培根和霍布斯都是很好的代表。到了洛克，客观情况变了。英国的资产阶级要和贵族地主妥协来建立资产阶级专政，1688年的革命就是这种妥协促成的。洛克的哲学是唯物论和唯心论并存的。可是这还不能满足资产阶级后来的需要。到巴克莱和休谟，就把经验主义的唯物的基础抽掉。经验主义当时是科学的理论，把它的唯物主义抽去，就是把当时科学理论的唯物主义抽去。这样一来科学和宗教也就比较地相安无事了。
    康福斯这两本书所批判的中心内容是在帝国主义时代资产阶级唯心论的哲学家歪曲科学理论和利用歪曲了的科学理论的哲学史。从这一角度去了解实用主义和逻辑实证论，我们就认识到帝国主义的唯心哲学的主流是巴克莱、休谟、康德、马赫的继续。帝国主义垄断资产阶级日益需要增加它的最大的利润，需要军国主义，所以也需要某种科学，但是，它更加需要加强它的压迫，加深它的剥削，所以它更需要唯心论和宗教迷信。因此它使科学服从于宗教。为帝国主义服务的唯心哲学家和巴克莱等的任务一样，这就是歪曲科学理论，使它成为唯心论的。科学是不断发展的，它不断地提出了新问题。因此唯心论不得不穿上新衣服，用新的名词和更烦琐的方法来歪曲科学理论。康福斯的第一本书很清楚地叙述了这一过程。从罗素到卡尔纳普，科学理论中的唯物主义日甚一日地被排除出去了。他们排除唯物主义用什么方法呢？巴克莱用经验主义的名义来取消它的唯物主义，现代的唯心哲学家也用科学的名义来排除科学理论中的唯物主义。在资本主义社会里唯心哲学家在一定的程度上已经把科学底理论歪曲利用了。
    “五四”以来我们的科学也是受了唯心论的腐蚀的。年纪大一点的人们还记得30年前的“科学”和玄学底论战。它一方面是统治阶级内部的斗争，玄学派代表封建地主，“科学”派代表买办资产阶级。另一方面，他们都为帝国主义服务，都反对革命，都反对马克思列宁主义。但是“科学”派具有更大的欺骗性，首先，因为“科学”派是披着科学外衣来反对科学的。其次，在那一论战中“科学”派战胜了。“科学”派底哲学就是康福斯所批判的哲学。它在解放前取得近30年的统治。要使我们的科学发展起来，能负得起建设的任务，一方面要好好地学习苏联，另一方面要彻底地批判披着科学外衣来进行反科学的巴克莱、马赫、罗素、杜威，一直到卡尔纳普的主观唯心论的哲学。我们要赶快做这一工作，努力做这一工作，树立我们的马克思列宁主义的世界观，赶上国家社会主义建设的需要。
