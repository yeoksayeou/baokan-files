Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, February 9th: The Thai newspaper "Sathienraphap Daily" recently pointed out that Thai residents are requesting the government to establish diplomatic and trade relations with the People's Republic of China. The newspaper stated that the United States' prohibition on selling rubber to China has caused significant losses to the Thai economy.

Another Thai newspaper, "Siam Rat Daily," stated in an editorial that because the United States has implemented an "embargo" policy against China, many countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, have lost substantial profits and good markets. The newspaper said that this policy only benefits the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, February 8th: The Thai bi-monthly magazine "Pitupoom" recently published an editorial calling for the Thai government to implement an independent and autonomous foreign policy.

The editorial pointed out that most of the Thai public hopes that the Thai government, starting from the long-term interests of the country and the majority of the public, will bravely and decisively implement an independent foreign policy. The editorial said that if anyone thinks that it is impossible for the Thai people to demand that the government implement an independent foreign policy free from American control, it would be a seriously unintelligent idea. Because in the past seven or eight years, the Thai people have been able to truly understand the United States.

The editorial said, "Thailand can only solve the current chaotic political and economic problems by implementing an independent foreign policy."

    泰国报纸主张同我国建立正常关系
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社曼谷9日讯：泰国报纸“萨堤恩拉帕布报”最近指出，泰国居民要求政府同中华人民共和国建立外交关系和贸易关系。这家报纸说，美国禁止把橡胶卖给中国，这使泰国的经济遭到了很大的损失。
    泰国另一家报纸“暹罗群众报”在社论中指出，由于美国推行了对中国“禁运”的政策，使许多国家，特别是东南亚国家，失去了大笔的利润和良好的市场。这家报纸说，这种政策只是对美国有好处。
    新华社8日讯　曼谷消息：泰文“比都奔”半月刊最近发表社论，要求泰国政府实行独立自主的外交政策。
    社论指出，泰国大部分公众希望泰国政府以国家和大部分公众的长远利益为出发点，勇敢果断地执行独立的外交政策。社论说，要是有人以为，泰国人民要求政府执行不受美国控制的独立外交政策是一件不可能的事，那将是一种严重的不聪明的想法。因为这七八年来泰国人民已经能够真正认识美国了。
    社论说，“泰国只有执行独立的外交政策，才能解决目前混乱的政治和经济问题”。
