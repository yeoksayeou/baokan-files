    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I am very excited after listening to the reports of the leading comrades, and I express my heartfelt support.
    In Premier Zhou's report, he said: "Our intellectuals will further unite around the Chinese Communist Party and strive to improve our country's scientific and cultural level. The alliance between our workers, peasants, and intellectuals in the socialist cause will become stronger day by day. Relying on the strength of this alliance, we will surely overfulfill our country's industrial development plan and accelerate the technological transformation of the national economy." This points out the direction of our efforts for intellectuals. From Premier Zhou's "Report on the Question of Intellectuals," we feel the Party and government's meticulous care for intellectuals. At the same time, we also feel that intellectuals bear an even greater responsibility in the national construction cause. How can we live up to the expectations of the Party and government and complete the glorious and arduous tasks given by the great motherland? Just as Dean Guo Moruo called for in his report, I would like to briefly report on my past experience in popularizing science and express my opinion on adapting to the new requirements and striving to improve the scientific and technological level of workers in addition to doing a good job in teaching. Please correct me if I am wrong.
    In order to improve production, workers generally demand to learn technology, and mechanical workers are even more eager to learn to read mechanical drawings. However, reading drawings is a skill that has not been taught well in the past few years. Workers have tight production tasks and do not have much time to learn, which requires quick learning. For the past two years, under the leadership of the Party, the organization of the Science Popularization Association, and based on learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, I have created a quick-learning method for mechanical workers to read drawings. Using popular language to explain the principles of projection and fully utilizing summarizing rhymes makes it easy for workers to understand and remember. After only 10 hours of lectures and 10 hours of practice, second- and third-grade workers who originally did not understand drawings can understand the working drawings of general parts and simple assembly drawings, and can carry out construction according to the drawings, eliminating or reducing the rework and defective products caused by not understanding the drawings in the past. Since this teaching method has been piloted in cities such as Wuhan, Lushun-Dalian, Xinxiang, Harbin, and Shenyang, it has been valued by various factories and welcomed by workers. The problem of mechanical workers reading drawings can be considered to have been initially resolved. However, the workers then asked me to continue writing a "Quick-Learning Method for Mechanical Workers to Draw Drawings." Because they can only read drawings but cannot draw them, their inventions and rationalization proposals cannot be expressed, which hinders them from doing more, faster, better, and more economically. I know the principle that science should serve production, and I have also initially considered the content of the quick-learning drawing method. However, my own teaching work is becoming heavier and heavier, and the requirements are getting higher and higher. When time is tight, I put it down. However, the workers keep writing to me requesting it, and I feel very uneasy. Even when I participated in the Wuhan Municipal Advanced Producers Representatives Conference at the end of last year, I only made a guarantee to prepare an outline for the quick-learning drawing method during this year's summer vacation. As for when the entire book would be written, I had not made specific arrangements. After arriving in Beijing and hearing the report of the leaders of the Science Popularization Association, I had a greater understanding of the importance of popularizing science to the masses. After repeated consideration, after eliminating some unnecessary concerns and thinking about all possible conditions, I made a plan to complete the entire book ahead of schedule in June of this year. After obtaining the consent of relevant leaders in Beijing, I have solemnly made a guarantee to our beloved Chairman Mao as a gift for my participation in this conference.
    Why was I able to create a quick-learning method for mechanical workers to read drawings in the past? Simply put, it is due to the correct leadership of the Party. I spent 50 years in the old society and had no opportunity to do anything beneficial for the people. After liberation, I personally saw the Chinese people stand up under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and the country become rich and strong. I have been very excited. Through learning, I realized that I should contribute my scientific knowledge combined with the needs of the workers to them. The support and care of the Party and the enthusiastic learning of the workers encouraged me, making me tirelessly squeeze out my spare time to compile and revise teaching materials, and personally go to factories to give lectures and participate in tutoring, thus achieving effects that I myself did not expect. Why did I delay the work of writing a quick-learning drawing method until now? The main reason is that conservative thinking is at play, and secondly, I have insufficient understanding of the importance of popularizing science, so I did not combine science popularization work with teaching work. On the other hand, it is also because I did not fully estimate the favorable conditions, make plans and arrangements. In recent years, I have received too much praise and awards from the Party and government, and I only wanted to do more and better teaching work, which produced the idea of doing science popularization work after I had enough energy. In fact, teaching work is endless, and science popularization work will never be completed with an idea like mine. But the problem lies in the fact that if the teaching of workers' drawing is delayed, it is extremely detrimental to production. After recognizing these things, some unnecessary concerns were eliminated, and a solution was found. That is to properly arrange the work of the teaching and research office, regard writing a quick-learning drawing method as scientific research work, appropriately use a part of the collective force to do it, and then separate out some things that do not necessarily need me to do and let others do them, so I will have time to preside over this work. In particular, the support of the Party Committee of our school has strengthened my confidence, so the quick-learning drawing method for mechanical workers can be completed ahead of schedule.
    The above shows that as long as conservative thinking is overcome, the potential of scientific workers can be brought into play. I sincerely express here that I will certainly follow the instructions of the leaders, strengthen theoretical study, improve my ideological and professional level; strive to conduct self-remolding, overcome all incorrect thoughts, so that in addition to doing a good job in teaching, I can continue to contribute all my strength to the glorious work of helping workers improve their scientific and technological level.

    赵学田的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    听了各位领导同志的报告以后，我很兴奋，我表示衷心的拥护。
    在周总理的报告中，他曾说：“我国知识分子将进一步团结在中国共产党的周围，为提高我国的科学文化水平而奋斗。我国工人、农民和知识分子在社会主义事业中的联盟将一天比一天巩固。我们依靠这个联盟的力量，一定可以超额完成我国的工业发展计划和加速进行国民经济的技术改造。”给我们知识分子指出了努力的方向，又从周总理“关于知识分子问题的报告”中，我们感觉到党和政府对于知识分子的关怀无微不至，同时也感到知识分子在国家建设事业中所负责任更加重大，要怎样才能够不辜负党和政府的期待，来完成伟大祖国所给与光荣而艰巨的任务。正如郭沫若院长在他的报告中所号召的一样，因此我想简单地报告我过去做科学普及工作的一点体会并表示今后适应新的要求，于搞好教学工作之外为提高工人的科学技术水平而努力的意见，请各位指正。
    为了提高生产，工人同志普遍要求学习技术，机械工人更迫切要求学会看机械图。但看图是过去几年都教不好的一种技术，工人生产任务紧，没有很多的时间来学习，这就要求速成。两年以来我在党的领导下，在科普协会的组织下，在学习苏联先进经验的基础上，创造了机械工人速成看图法。应用通俗的语言讲解投影的原理，并充分利用总结性的歌诀，使工人容易理解便于记忆。工人只要经过10小时的听课和10小时的练习就使得原来不懂图的二三级工人能够看懂一般机件的工作图和简单的装配图，并做到按图施工，消灭或减少了过去因看不懂图而造成的返工和出废品的现象。这个教学法在武汉、旅大、新乡、哈尔滨、沈阳等城市试教以来，受到各工厂的重视和工人同志的欢迎。机械工人看图的问题算是初步得到了解决。但是随之而来的是工人同志又纷纷要求我继续编写“机械工人速成画图法”。因为只会看图而不会画图，他们的创造发明和合理化建议就表达不出来，对于要做得又多又快又好又省，是有妨碍的。我知道科学应为生产服务的道理，我也初步考虑过速成画图法的内容。但是本身的教学工作越来越重，要求越来越高，时间一紧就把它压下来了。但是工人同志不断来信提出要求，我心中非常不安。一直到去年年底参加武汉市先进生产者代表会议的时候我还只是提出今年暑假编好速成画图法提纲的保证。至于何时将全书写成，我还没有作出具体的安排。到京后听到科普协会领导同志的报告，我对于科学必须普及于大众的重要性有了更多的体会。我经过反复考虑，在消除了某些不应有的顾虑和想到了各项可能的条件之后，我作出了提前于今年六月就编出全书的计划。经征得在京的有关领导方面同意之后，我已郑重地向我们敬爱的毛主席提出了保证，作为我这次参加会议的献礼。
    我为什么过去能创造出机械工人速成看图法呢？简单地说，是由于党的正确领导。我在旧社会过了50年，没有机会对人民作出什么有益的事情。解放后亲自看到中国人民在毛主席的领导下站起来了，国家富强起来了，我一直很兴奋。通过学习，我认识到我应该把我学得的一点科学知识结合工人的需要贡献给他们。党的支持与关怀，工人同志的热情学习鼓舞着我，使我不知疲倦地挤出业余的时间来编写和修订教材，并亲自到工厂讲课，参加辅导，因此取得了我自己也预料不到的效果。我为什么把编写速成画图法的工作拖到现在呢？主要的是保守思想在作怪，其次还由于对于科学大众化的重要性认识不足，因而没有把科普工作和教学工作结合起来。另一方面还由于没有将有利的条件加以充分的估计，作出规划和安排。我近年来受了党和政府过多的表扬和奖励，只想把教学工作做得更多更好，产生一种行有余力再作科普工作的想法也阻碍了我。事实上教学工作是无止境的，像我那样的想法科普工作便永远做不成了。但问题正是在于如果推迟了工人画图的教学，对生产是极不利的。在认识了这些之后，某些不应有的顾虑便消除了，办法也就想出来了。就是将教研室的工作加以妥善的安排，把编写速成画图法作为科学研究工作，适当运用一部分集体力量来做，再分出些不一定要我作的事让别人做，我就有时间主持这一工作了。特别是我校党委的支持加强了我的信心，因此机械工人速成画图法就可以提前完成了。
    以上可以说明，只要克服了保守思想，科学工作者的潜力便可以发挥出来。我在此诚恳地表示，我一定遵照各首长的指示，加强理论学习，提高思想和业务水平；努力进行自我改造，克服一切不正确的思想，使我除在搞好教学工作之外，还能够为帮助工人同志提高科学技术水平这一光荣的工作继续不断地贡献我所有的力量。
