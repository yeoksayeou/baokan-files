    Xinhua News Agency, Amritsar, February 11th. The Proposals Committee of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress continued its session on February 10th. The meeting passed proposals on economic policy and the Five-Year Plan, on provincial zoning, and on the "Call to Savings."

    The proposal on economic policy and the Five-Year Plan stated that the decision made by the National Congress at its annual meeting in Awadhi last year regarding a "socialist pattern of society" has been widely welcomed, because this decision points out a new direction for the country's planned development program.

    The proposal stated that the aims and objectives of the First Five-Year Plan have been largely achieved, with national income increasing by 18%, compared to the original target of 11%. The transformation of the Imperial Bank of India into a publicly owned and operated National Bank and the nationalization of life insurance companies are important steps on the road to evolving into a "socialist structure."

    The proposal pointed out that the rapid development of industrialization has become a necessity, and special emphasis should be placed on the development of industries of fundamental importance such as the steel industry, heavy machinery manufacturing, heavy chemical industry, and petroleum industry. The power industry and transportation equipment should be coordinated with developments in other areas. The proposal went on to say that family industries, rural industries, and small-scale industries play an important role in maintaining large-scale employment and supplying certain necessary consumer goods. Therefore, decentralized local industries, as an integral part of the economic structure, must improve their efficiency and effectively complete their tasks. To this end, rural electrification should be universally developed.

    The proposal also stated that the public sector should develop rapidly, but the private sector should also play an important role within the scope of the plan. The organization of industry and agriculture should be increasingly based on cooperatives. The proposal emphasized the necessity of establishing industrial and agricultural cooperatives. The proposal also stated that land reform plans should be vigorously promoted.

    The proposal also stated that rural engineering and national development undertakings should be popularized throughout the entire rural area of the country.

    The proposal stated that the Second Five-Year Plan stipulates an increase of 25% in national income and recommends laying the foundation for the manufacture of heavy machinery. It is estimated that another ten million people can be employed during this period, including two million in agriculture. The implementation of this plan requires not only the efforts of the central government and the provincial (state) governments and official organs, but also, in particular, the enthusiastic support and participation of the people at every step.

    While presenting this proposal, Plan and Development Minister Nanda said that the greatest achievement of the First Five-Year Plan was the solution of the food problem. The time has come when India should be self-sufficient in all aspects. He said that only when India manufactures all the heavy machinery it needs can India be said to be free in the true sense of the word "freedom."

    印度国大党年会通过五年计划提案
    新华社阿姆利则11日电　印度国大党第六十一届年会提案委员会2月10日继续举行会议。会议通过了关于经济政策和五年计划、关于省区划分和“号召储蓄”的提案。
    关于经济政策和五年计划的提案说，国大党去年在阿瓦迪举行的年会上作出的关于“社会主义式样的社会”的决定，受到广泛的欢迎，因为这个决定为国家按计划发展的纲领指出了新的方向。
    提案说，第一个五年计划的宗旨和目标已大体实现，国民收入增加了18％，而原来的目标是11％。印度帝国银行变为公有和公营的国家银行以及人寿保险企业的国有化是演变为“社会主义结构”的道路上的重要步骤。
    提案指出，工业化的迅速发展已经成为必要的事情，并且应当特别着重发展钢铁工业、重型机器制造业、重型化学工业和石油工业等具有基本重要性的工业。电力工业和运输设备应当和其他方面的发展互相配合。提案接着说，家庭工业、农村工业和小规模工业在维持大量就业和供应某些必要的消费品方面起着重要作用。因此，分散的地方工业作为经济结构中不可分割的一部分，必须提高它的效率和使它有效地完成任务。为此，应当普遍发展农村电气化。
    提案又说，公营部分应当迅速发展，但是私营部分也应当在计划的范围内起重要作用。工业和农业的组织应当越来越多地放在合作社的基础上。提案强调必须办工业和农业合作社。提案还说，应当大力推行土地改革计划。
    提案又说，乡村工程和全国发展事业应当普及到全国整个农村地区。
    提案说，第二个五年计划规定使国民收入增加25％，并且建议为重型机器的制造打下基础。估计这一时期内将又有一千万人可以就业，其中包括农业方面的两百万人。执行这个计划不仅需要中央政府和各省（邦）政府以及官方机关的努力，而且特别需要得到人民在每一步骤上的热烈支持和参加。
    计划和开发部长南达在提出这个提案的时候说，第一个五年计划的最大的成就是粮食问题的解决。印度在各方面都应该自给自足的时候已经来到。他说，只有当印度制造了它所需要的全部重型机器的时候，印度才可以在自由这个字眼的真正意义上说是自由了。
