    Xinhua News Agency Report: This year, China's flue-cured tobacco planting area will reach 4.94 million mu, an increase of 1.2 million mu compared to last year. The unit area yield will reach 171.2 jin, and the total output will reach 8.45 million dan. The above production targets were proposed at the recent National Tobacco Professional Conference. After these targets are achieved, they will exceed the originally planned 1957 production targets by 8.4%.
    This professional conference was jointly convened in Beijing by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement. After exchanging advanced production experiences from various regions, the conference believed that it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill this year's production plan.
    The conference conducted detailed discussions on actively promoting improved varieties, cultivating robust seedlings and ratoon tobacco, as well as increasing base fertilizer application, preventing and controlling pests and diseases, and promoting advanced production experiences. In order to implement these yield-increasing measures, it was decided to carry out high-yield campaigns on a large area of 320,000 mu of tobacco fields in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Liaoning, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, with the aim of striving for a yield of over 300 jin per mu. To strengthen technical guidance on flue-cured tobacco production, this year, the focus will be on flue-cured tobacco cultivation, curing, grading, and other technologies. More than 79,000 tobacco technicians will be trained for cooperatives in tobacco-growing areas. It is also planned to organize more than 1,500 flue-cured tobacco experts to impart curing techniques to newly developed tobacco areas to ensure curing quality. The conference also determined that tobacco experimental stations in various regions should combine with the technical strength of agricultural colleges to actively research hybridization techniques, breed hybrid seeds, collect local varieties, select disease-resistant varieties, and strengthen research on issues such as the technical process of flue-cured tobacco production.

    全国烟草专业会议计划
    今年烤烟产量将达到845万担
    据新华社讯　我国今年烤烟的种植面积将要达到494万亩，比去年扩大120万亩；单位面积产量将达到171.2斤，总产量达到845万担。以上的生产指标是最近举行的全国烟草专业会议上提出来的。这个指标实现以后，将超过原订1957年生产指标的8.4％。
    这个专业会议是由农业部和农产品采购部在北京联合召开的。会议在交流了各地先进生产经验以后，认为完全有条件完成和超额完成今年的生产计划。
    会议对积极推广良种、培养壮苗和再生烟、以及增施基肥、防治病虫患害和推广先进生产经验等问题都作了详细讨论。为了贯彻这些增产措施，决定在山东、河南、安徽、辽宁、云南、贵州6省的32万亩烟田的大面积上，开展丰产运动，每亩产量要求争取达到300斤以上。在加强对烤烟生产的技术指导方面，今年要以烤烟栽培、烘烤、分级等技术为中心，为烟区合作社训练79，000多名烟草技术员，并且计划组织1，500多名烤烟能手到新发展的烟区传授烘烤技术，以保证烘烤质量。会议还确定各地的烟草试验站要结合农业院校的技术力量，积极研究杂交技术，繁育杂交种子、收集农家品种，选育抗病品种和加强对烤烟生产技术过程等问题的研究。
