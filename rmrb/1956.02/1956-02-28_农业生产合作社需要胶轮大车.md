    Agricultural Production Cooperatives Need Rubber-Tired Carts
    Jiang Weishen
    With the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the volume of transportation in agricultural production has greatly increased. Old transportation tools that are strenuous and have low carrying capacity, such as iron-wheeled carts, four-wheeled carts, wooden-wheeled carts, and handcarts, are no longer able to meet the needs of agricultural production development, especially during the spring fertilization and autumn harvest seasons. A lack of transportation tools will affect agricultural production increases. Last year, the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tong County, Hebei Province, originally planned to apply 4,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, but due to a lack of transportation tools, they could only apply 3,430 jin. The Zhenxiguan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linyi County, Shanxi Province, accumulated 4,000 cartloads of fertilizer last winter, but due to insufficient vehicles, only 2,000 cartloads were delivered to the fields in time, which prevented the completion of the cotton production increase plan. Some agricultural production cooperatives in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, due to insufficient vehicles, were only able to transport the grain and other crops produced last autumn by February of this year, making it impossible to complete the state's procurement plan and agricultural tax revenue plan in a timely manner. Therefore, farmers are now urgently demanding an increase in transportation tools with a large carrying capacity.
    Based on this situation, the Ministry of Commerce, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and the Agricultural Bank began experimenting with supplying rubber-tired carts to agricultural production cooperatives through loans in 12 provinces, including Hebei, Henan, and Heilongjiang, starting in the fourth quarter of last year. In just one quarter, 20,000 sets of tires were loaned out, with Heilongjiang alone borrowing 8,487 sets. Some agricultural production cooperatives that did not receive rubber-tired carts wrote letters to the provincial supply and marketing cooperatives, commercial departments, and agricultural banks, requesting continued loans.
    However, some people underestimate the need for rubber-tired carts in rural areas, believing that what rural areas urgently need now are double-wheeled double-furrow plows, fertilizers, etc., and that the need for rubber-tired carts is not urgent. Others believe that rubber-tired carts are expensive, and farmers may not be able to afford them, so they do not actively support it. For example, the Zhaidian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, raised 50% of the funds themselves and requested that the Farmers Bank lend them 50% to purchase rubber-tired carts. The bank also had the conditions to provide the loan, but was unwilling to lend it.
    Facts have proven that this kind of ideological understanding is conservative. The agricultural cooperativization movement is being widely carried out, and purchasing rubber-tired carts has become a common demand of farmers. Many provinces and counties have included the required number of rubber-tired carts in the overall rural plan based on the needs of farmers. For example, Shandong Province plans to need 20,000 rubber-tired carts this year; Henan Province plans to need 15,000 this year and 20,000 next year; Linyi County, Shanxi Province, plans to increase the number of rubber-tired carts by 130 in the first half of this year and increase to 500 to 600 in 1957, so that every cooperative has rubber-tired carts.
    Do agricultural production cooperatives have the ability to purchase them? Yes. Many agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei, Henan, Shandong and other provinces can generally raise 30% of the funds themselves when purchasing rubber-tired carts, and some can raise 50% of the funds themselves. The Yinzhuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luan County, Hebei Province, purchased a rubber-tired cart, and the annual repayment of the loan only accounted for 15.7% of last year's public accumulation fund, in addition to the funds they raised themselves.
    This year, the state has decided to supply agricultural production cooperatives with rubber-tired carts in accordance with last year's agricultural loan method. Based on the current production situation of rubber-tired carts, there is no major problem in meeting the supply this year. Therefore, relevant units must overcome conservative ideas, organize forces, and ensure that this work is done well.

    农业生产合作社需要胶轮大车
    姜渭莘
    随着农业合作化运动的发展，农业生产中的运输量大大增加。旧有的费力大、载重量小的运输工具，如铁轮车、四轮车、木轮车、手推车等，已经不能适应农业生产发展的需要，特别在春季施肥、秋季收获的时候更感缺少。运输工具不够就会影响农业增产。河北省通县前进农业生产合作社去年原计划每亩施肥4，000斤，由于运输工具缺乏，只能施肥3，430斤。山西省临猗县镇西关农业生产合作社，去年冬季积肥4，000车，因为车辆不足，只有2，000车及时送到地里，使棉花增产计划完不成。黑龙江省肇东县有的农业生产合作社因车辆不足，去年秋季生产的粮食和其他农作物，到今年2月才能运完，使国家的收购计划和农业税收计划也不能及时完成。因此，现在农民迫切要求增加载重量大的运输工具。
    商业部、全国供销合作总社和农业银行根据这一情况，从去年第四季度开始，在河北、河南、黑龙江等12个省，试验以贷款办法供应农业生产合作社胶轮大车。在短短的一个季度中，就贷出2万套轮胎，仅黑龙江一个省就贷去8，487套。有些没有贷到胶轮车的农业生产合作社纷纷给省供销合作社、商业厅、农业银行写信，要求继续贷给。
    然而有人对农村需要胶轮车的情况估计不足，认为农村现在迫切需要的是双轮双铧犁、肥料等，对胶轮大车的需要并不迫切。也有人认为胶轮大车价钱高，恐怕农民买不起，因此不积极支持。如山西省稷山县翟店农业生产合作社自筹资金50％，要求农民银行贷给50％购买胶轮大车，银行也有条件贷款，但是不肯贷给。
    事实证明，这种思想认识是保守的。农业合作化运动正在广泛开展，购买胶轮大车已成为农民的普遍要求，很多省、县已根据农民的要求，把胶轮大车的需要数量列入农村全面规划中。如山东省今年计划需要胶轮大车2万辆；河南省今年计划需要15，000辆，明年计划需要2万辆；山西省临猗县计划在今年上半年增加胶轮大车130辆，1957年计划增加到500辆到600辆，做到社社都有胶轮大车。
    农业生产合作社有没有力量购买呢？有。河北、河南、山东等省的很多农业生产合作社在购买胶轮大车的时候，一般都能自筹资金30％，其中有的可以自筹资金50％。河北省栾县尹琢农业生产合作社购买胶轮大车一辆，除自筹资金外，每年偿还贷款数仅占去年公积金的15.7％。
    今年国家决定按着去年农业贷款的办法，供应农业生产合作社胶轮大车，而根据目前胶轮大车的生产情况，今年在满足供应上还没有太大问题，因此，有关单位必须克服保守思想，组织力量，保证做好这一工作。
