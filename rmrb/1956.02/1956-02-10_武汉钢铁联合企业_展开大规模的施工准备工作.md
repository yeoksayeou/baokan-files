Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 9th - The site leveling project for the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise has commenced. From this point on, construction preparations for this iron and steel complex will unfold on a large scale.

The workers responsible for the site leveling project have pledged to complete the entire year's engineering tasks within 11 months and significantly reduce costs.

By August of last year, the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise had essentially completed its construction preparations and began preparing for construction. During the construction preparation phase, the site will be leveled, a large number of employee residences, engineering auxiliary enterprises, auxiliary repair facilities, and warehouses will be built. In addition, railways, highways, docks, and water and power supply equipment will be built to serve the construction.

Currently, many red-brick and red-tile bungalows have been built near the plant area. These are the first batch of completed employee residences. The main factory building of the concrete mixing plant, which is part of the engineering auxiliary enterprises, has been completed. The factory buildings for the timber processing plant, the steel bar processing plant, and the vehicle base have all been completed. Several other engineering auxiliary enterprises are also excavating foundation trenches. Several kilometers of power transmission lines, water supply pipelines, and highway projects have either been completed or are still under construction. A newly built railway branch line has also been extended to the edge of the plant area.

    武汉钢铁联合企业
    展开大规模的施工准备工作
    新华社武汉9日电　武汉钢铁联合企业的厂基平整工程已经动工。从此，建设这个钢铁联合企业的施工准备工作就大规模地展开了。
    担任厂基平整工程的职工提出保证，要在11个月内完成今年全年的工程任务，并且把成本大量降低。
    武汉钢铁联合企业到去年8月份基本上完成了建厂筹备工作，开始施工准备。在施工准备阶段要平整厂基，兴建大批职工住宅、工程附属企业、辅助修理设施、仓库，并且修建为施工服务的铁路、公路、码头和给水、供电设备。
    现在，厂区附近已经建成了很多红砖红瓦的平房，这是刚刚完工的第一批职工住宅。工程附属企业中的混凝土搅拌厂的主厂房已经建成。木材加工厂、钢筋加工厂、汽车基地的厂房建筑都已经完工。另外几个工程附属企业也正在挖掘地槽。若干公里的输电线路、供水管道和公路工程，有的已经完成，有的还在施工。一条新修的铁路支线，也延伸到厂区边沿了。
