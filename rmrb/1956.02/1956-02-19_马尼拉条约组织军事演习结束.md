Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's joint land, sea, and air military exercises in Thailand concluded on February 17th.

Western news agencies make no secret of the fact that the purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate that this military group, engineered by the United States, has "teeth" in order to intimidate Asian countries and create tension in Asia. The United States used so-called "Honest John" rockets and jet aircraft capable of carrying atomic bombs in the exercise. Reuters' Washington correspondent quoted "a leading Western diplomat" on February 15 as saying that "it looks more like a demonstration than a real exercise." The "Washington Post and Times Herald" editorial on February 16 said that the exercise "exudes an atmosphere of heating up the Cold War" and is an "unnecessary provocation."

At the same time, the United States also conducted a "large-scale exercise of atomic age amphibious warfare" on Iwo Jima, with exercises involving the dropping of dummy atomic bombs and landing operations. The "New York Times" admitted that some of the countries participating in the exercise "came to prop up the scene after receiving hasty notice," and that it was not "a demonstration of unity." United Press International reported that a British person called the exercise "99 percent an American show."

    马尼拉条约组织军事演习结束
    据新华社18日讯　马尼拉条约组织在泰国举行的陆、海、空军联合军事演习已经在2月17日结束。
    西方通讯社的消息毫不掩饰这次演习的目的是要显示这个由美国策划建立的军事集团是有“牙齿”的，以便对亚洲国家进行恫吓，在亚洲制造紧张局势。美国在演习中使用了所谓“诚实的约翰”火箭和能够载运原子弹的喷气式飞机。路透社驻华盛顿记者2月15日援引“一位主要的西方外交界人士”的话说，“看起来它像一次示威而不像一次真正的演习。”“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”2月16日的社论说，这次演习“散发出了热化冷战的气氛”，它是一种“不必要的挑衅”。
    与此同时，美国还在硫黄岛进行了“原子时代两栖战的大规模演习”，演习投掷假原子弹和登陆战。“纽约时报”承认，参加演习的某些国家是“在接到仓促的通知后前来支撑场面的”，它不是“一次团结的表现”。合众社报道，一位英国人士把这次演习叫作“99％的美国的表演”。
