    This Year, More Than a Thousand Small Hydropower Stations to be Built Across the Country

    (Our Newspaper News) This year, the state will assist farmers in building more than 1,000 small hydropower stations, with a planned total power generation of over 30,000 kilowatts, which can supply electricity for the production and daily life of more than 500,000 farming households.

    Various provinces are currently training cadres and technicians in large numbers, and carrying out survey and design work in preparation for the construction of small hydropower stations. From late February to early April, the Ministry of Water Resources will assist local water conservancy departments in Shanxi, Fujian, and Sichuan provinces to train 400 intermediate technical cadres, respectively, as the basic force for these provinces to carry out rural hydropower work.

    These small hydropower stations will all be built in accordance with the principle of "run by the people with government assistance," with the state providing assistance in terms of technology and loans. In order to save funds, these hydropower stations will make as much use as possible of existing water conservancy engineering structures, and some will also use wooden propeller-type water turbines that can be manufactured locally, and adopt the method of high-voltage power transmission using two iron wires.

    今年全国将兴建一千多座小型水电站
    本报讯　今年国家将帮助农民兴建小型水力发电站1，000多座，总发电量计划达到30，000多瓩，约可供应50多万户农民的生产和生活用电。
    各省目前正在大量训练干部、技工，进行勘查设计工作，为兴建小型水电站作准备。水利部将在2月下旬到4月上旬，分别在山西、福建、四川3省帮助当地水利部门训练中等技术干部400人，作为这些省开展农村水力发电工作的基本力量。
    这些小型水电站都将按照“民办公助”的方针兴建，国家在技术方面、贷款方面加以帮助。为了节省资金，这些水电站都将尽可能利用原有的水利工程建筑物，一部分还将采用可以就地制造的木质螺旋桨式水轮机，采用两根铁导线高压输电的办法。
