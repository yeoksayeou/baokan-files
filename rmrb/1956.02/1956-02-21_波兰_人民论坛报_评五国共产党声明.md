Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 20th - The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial on February 19th entitled "A Historic Document," commenting on the declaration of the five Communist and Workers' Parties.

The editorial said: The broadest working masses of our country will view the declaration of the five parties with deep satisfaction. Under the leadership of the Polish Communist Party, they have waged many great class struggles. For them, the achievements of the Polish Communist Party were, are, and will be their own class achievements.

The declaration states that there was no reason to dissolve the Polish Communist Party. This declaration historically affirms the Polish Communist Party and its heroic struggle for the social liberation of the people and for Poland's lasting and genuine independence, and affirms the selflessness and courage of the members and leaders of the party.

In 1938, the Communist International passed a resolution to dissolve the Polish Communist Party. The resolution was based on the accusation that hostile elements had extensively infiltrated the leadership of the Polish Communist Party. This accusation was based on materials fabricated by a group of bad elements, secret agents, and provocateurs, whose true mission was only revealed after the exposure of Beria. The fabricated nature of the accusations made at the time against many selfless and highly respected comrades in the leadership of the Polish Communist Party is today undeniably confirmed. Their party honor has been fully restored, and their personal reputations have been fully restored. The declaration we are publishing proves that the accusations made at the time were unfounded.

Of course, we must never forget that the bourgeois governments of many countries have long used, and continue to this day to use, despicable weapons of provocation in their opposition to the revolutionary workers' movement, with the aim of undermining workers' organizations from within.

The Pilsudski regime meticulously attempted to use such vile and treacherous methods to oppose the Polish Communist Party.

The "People's Tribune" continued: The declaration regarding the Polish Communist Party is evidence of the great moral strength of the international communist movement. The truth about the Polish Communist Party has come to light, thanks primarily to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which exposed Beria's criminal activities.

This is a manifestation of the unwavering determination to correct the mistakes caused by the Beria gang to the workers' movement, and proof of a deep concern for historical truth—a concern that inspires the entire international revolutionary movement. This concern prompted the representatives of the fraternal parties of the Soviet Union, Italy, Bulgaria, and Finland—parties that were members of the Communist International's "Polish Commission" in 1938—to decide to reinvestigate the Polish Communist Party issue based on the initiative of our party. After a thorough investigation of the facts, the historical truth about the Polish Communist Party and its leading and heroic role as the revolutionary vanguard of the Polish workers' movement has been proven. The declaration of the five parties makes clear the history of the Polish workers' struggle against the fascist dictatorship in Poland.

In this struggle, the Polish Communist Party played a decisive role as an experienced and unyielding leader, a strong organizer, infinitely loyal to socialist ideas, and extremely closely connected with the masses of the people.

In the struggle and work of building socialism in Poland, our party—the Polish United Workers' Party—is realizing the ideas that guided the soldiers of the Polish Communist Party in the most difficult days and gave them courage and inspiration in their arduous struggles. Our party, formed by the unification of the Polish Workers' Party and the Polish Socialist Party under the banner of a united front, is the heir to the heroic struggles of the Polish Communist Party.

This declaration clearly announces the true historical facts about the Polish Communist Party, and it will inspire our party to more actively consolidate international solidarity, further promote selfless spirit and raise the ideological level of its ranks, and further strengthen its ties with the broadest masses of the working people. It will inspire our party to strengthen its uncompromising attitude towards class enemies and any form of bourgeois ideology, and it will inspire our party to be faithful to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and to creatively apply Marxism-Leninism in life and under constantly changing real conditions. In our current struggle, in the cause of building socialism in Poland, it will be of great help to us.

### 波兰“人民论坛报”评五国共产党声明

    波兰“人民论坛报”评五国共产党声明
    新华社华沙20日电　波兰“人民论坛报”2月19日发表题为“历史性文件”的社论，评论五国共产党和工人党的声明。
    社论说：我国最广泛的劳动群众将怀着深为满意的心情看待五个党的声明，他们在波兰共产党领导下曾经进行过许多次伟大的阶级斗争，对他们来说，波兰共产党取得的成就过去曾是、将来还是他们自己的阶级成就。
    声明说，解散波兰共产党是没有理由的。这个声明在历史上肯定了波兰共产党和它为人民群众的社会解放和为波兰持久的、真正的独立进行的英勇斗争，肯定了党员们和党的领袖们的无私和勇敢。
    1938年，共产国际通过了一项解散波兰共产党的决议。决议所根据的是这样一个指责：敌对分子已经广泛地渗入了波兰共产党的领导机构。这个指责是根据一批坏分子、特务分子和挑衅分子伪造的材料，他们的真正任务是在揭露了贝利亚以后才知道的。当时对波兰共产党的领导机构的许多非常无私和受到党的非常重视的同志提出的指责的虚构性质今天不可争辩地得到了肯定。他们的党的荣誉已经完全恢复，他们个人的名誉也已经完全恢复。我们所刊载的声明正说明了当时提出的指责是没有根据的。
    当然，我们绝不能忘记，许多国家的资产阶级政府在反对革命工人运动的时候曾经长期使用、而且到今天还在使用卑鄙的挑衅武器，他们的目的在于从内部破坏工人组织。
    毕尔苏斯基政权曾处心积虑企图利用这种卑鄙奸诈的方法来反对波兰共产党。
      “人民论坛报”接着说：对于波兰共产党的声明是证明国际共产主义运动具有伟大道义力量的证据。波兰共产党的真相已经大白，这首先应当归功于苏联共产党，因为它揭露了贝利亚的罪恶活动。
    这是决心把贝利亚匪帮对工人运动所造成的错误纠正过来不屈不挠的意志的表现，这是对历史真实情况的深切关怀——一种鼓舞着整个国际革命运动的关怀——的证明。这种关怀促使苏联、意大利、保加利亚和芬兰的兄弟党——这些政党在1938年是共产国际“波兰委员会”的委员——的代表决心根据我们的党的倡议重新调查波兰共产党问题。由于在对事实进行彻底调查以后，对波兰共产党、对它作为波兰工人运动的革命先锋队所起的领导的英勇的作用的历史真相提供了证明。五个党的声明使人们清楚了解波兰工人群众反对波兰的法西斯独裁的斗争的历史。
    在这个斗争中，波兰共产党起了富有经验的不屈不挠的领导者、坚强的组织者的决定性作用，它对社会主义思想无限忠诚，它极其紧密地同人民群众联系。
    在波兰建设社会主义的斗争和工作中，我们的党——波兰统一工人党——正在实现那种在最困难的日子里指导着波兰共产党的战士并且在他们的艰苦斗争中给予他们以勇气和鼓舞的思想。我们的党是波兰工人党和波兰社会党在统一战线的旗帜下统一起来而组成的，它是波兰共产党英勇斗争的继承者。
    这个声明清楚地宣布了关于波兰共产党的真实历史情况，它将激励我们的党更加积极地巩固国际团结，进一步发扬忘我的精神和提高它的队伍的思想水平，并且进一步加强同最广大的劳动群众的联系。它将激励我们的党加强它对阶级敌人对任何形式的资产阶级思想的不妥协态度，它将激励我们的党忠于马克思列宁主义的原则，并且在生活中、在不断改变的现实条件下创造性地运用马克思列宁主义。在我们今天的斗争中，在波兰建设社会主义的事业中，它对我们将是极大的帮助。
