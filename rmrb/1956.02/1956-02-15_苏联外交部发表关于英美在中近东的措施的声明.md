Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 13th: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement regarding Anglo-American measures in the Near and Middle East.

The statement said that the joint statement issued by US President Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Eden on February 1 concerning the Anglo-American Washington talks stipulated certain joint measures, but the nature of these measures was not fully explained in the statement. Nevertheless, it is now clear that these unilateral measures, stipulated without the knowledge of the United Nations and without the participation of the countries of the Near and Middle East, will certainly endanger the peace and security of the Near and Middle East, and will certainly undermine the independence and sovereignty of the countries in this region, which is a violation of the principles and purposes of the United Nations.

The statement said that the participants of the Washington Conference insisted that the measures they planned to take towards the countries of the Near and Middle East were due to the "tense relationship between Israel and its Arab neighbors." In doing so they were trying to create the impression that the Tripartite Declaration of May 25, 1950, by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France entitled them to take arbitrary actions outside the United Nations.

The statement pointed out that the Arab countries have correctly stated that the Tripartite Declaration is essentially an attempt to divide the Near and Middle East into spheres of influence for certain countries and is an infringement on the independence and sovereignty of the Arab countries.

The statement further pointed out that it was precisely to carry out the above-mentioned military plan that the infamous Baghdad Pact was concluded, and the Arabs themselves are entirely correct in calling this treaty a prison for the peoples of various countries.

The statement said that in order to justify their actions, which appear to be the establishment of new military blocs, they are attempting to make it appear as if it is not these actions but the actions of the "Soviet bloc" that have deepened the tensions and increased the danger of war in the region. However, fewer and fewer people are willing to believe this absurd claim.

The statement also said that recent news reports have stated that certain countries intend to send their troops to the Near and Middle East region, and these reports have not been denied. Sending troops to the territory of the Near and Middle Eastern countries will constitute an action that is clearly contrary to strengthening peace, and will create a place of dangerous friction and tension in the above-mentioned region, which will make it more difficult to resolve the disputed issues between the countries of this region.

In its statement, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated that any actions that could cause disputes in the Near and Middle East and worsen the tense situation in this region cannot but arouse the legitimate concern of the Soviet Union.

The statement said that actions of sending troops to the territory of the Near and Middle Eastern countries without obtaining the consent of the countries concerned and without the permission of the United Nations Security Council, the body primarily responsible for maintaining peace, will be a serious violation of the United Nations Charter and an infringement on the national sovereignty of these countries.

The statement said that the Soviet government hopes that its attitude will be fully understood and supported by all peace-loving countries concerned with maintaining the peace, security, and territorial integrity of the countries of the Near and Middle East.

The statement said that as for the Soviet government, it will adhere to the principles of its peaceful foreign policy, and will continue to support the cause of peace, defend the freedom and independence of the Near and Middle Eastern countries and non-interference in their internal affairs, and will work with other relevant countries to consolidate the security of this region. The statement concluded by saying that the United Nations cannot ignore this type of action concerning the countries of the Near and Middle East.

    苏联外交部发表关于英美在中近东的措施的声明
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联外交部发表了关于英美在中近东的措施的声明。
    声明说，美国总统艾森豪威尔和英国首相艾登2月1日就英美华盛顿会谈发表的联合声明规定了某些联合措施，不过声明中并没有充分说明这些措施的性质。尽管如此，现在已经明显，在联合国没有知情和中近东国家没有参加的情况下规定的这些片面措施肯定地会危害中近东的和平和安全，并且肯定地会破坏这个地区的国家的独立和主权，而这是违反联合国的原则和宗旨的。
    声明说，华盛顿会议的参加者硬说他们对中近东国家计划采取的措施是由于“以色列和它的阿拉伯邻国关系上的紧张状态”，他们这样做是试图制造一种印象，好像1950年5月25日的美国、联合王国和法国的三国宣言使它们有资格在联合国之外采取专断的行动似的。
    声明指出，阿拉伯国家已经正确地说过，三国宣言实质上是要把中近东划分为某些国家的势力范围的图谋，并且是侵犯阿拉伯国家的独立和主权的。
    声明进一步指出，正是为了执行上述军事计划才缔结了臭名远扬的巴格达条约，而阿拉伯人自己把这个条约称为各国人民的监狱是完全正确的。
    声明说，为了替它们的表现为建立新军事集团的行动辩护，它们企图把事情说成似乎不是这些行动而是“苏联集团”的一些行动加深了这个地区的紧张局势和增加了战争的危险。不过，愿意相信这种荒谬说法的人是愈来愈少了。
    声明又说，近来报纸上的消息说某些国家打算派它们的军队到中近东地区去，而这些消息并没有遭到否认。把军队派到中近东国家领土上去将构成一种显然与加强和平背道而驰的行动，而且将在上述地区构成一个可以引起危险的摩擦和紧张的场所，这就会使得这个地区的国家之间的引起争执的问题更难获得解决。
    苏联外交部在声明中重申：任何足以在中近东引起纠纷以及使这个地区的紧张局势恶化的行动将不能不引起苏联的正当的关切。
    声明说，没有得到有关国家的同意以及没有得到对维持和平负主要责任的机构联合国安全理事会的许可而把军队派到中近东国家的领土上去的行动，将是严重违反联合国宪章以及侵犯这些国家的国家主权的行动。
    声明说，苏联政府希望它的态度将获得所有关心维持中近东国家的和平、安全和领土完整的爱好和平国家的充分谅解和支持。
    声明说，至于苏联政府，它将坚守它的和平外交政策的原则，今后将继续支持和平事业，保卫中近东国家的自由独立和内政不受干涉，同时将同其它有关国家一起来努力使这个地区的安全获得巩固。声明最后还说，联合国不能无视有关中近东国家的这种行动。
