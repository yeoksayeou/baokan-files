    Establishing Friendly Ties Between Chinese and Japanese Youth

    Editor's Note: On December 11th of last year, this newspaper's "Reader's Letter Special" published a letter from Japanese youth Seiko Hayase, in which she expressed her hope to establish friendly ties with Chinese youth. This friendly wish of Seiko Hayase has aroused enthusiastic responses among young people in both China and Japan. Many young people from all over our country wrote friendly letters to Seiko Hayase, and some even sent photos, art pictures, stamps, and books. The Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" reported on January 6th: "Letters from Chinese friends are flooding in." On the same day, the "Mainichi Shimbun" wrote: "A young girl's wish to be friends with Chinese friends has come true, and young Chinese men and women have sent her more than 200 letters at once." The "Sankei Jiji" newspaper believed that these letters expressing the young people's willingness to "join hands and get along well" "caused a pleasant topic in international friendship relations." On January 7th, the Japanese "Taiyo Shashin Shimbun" published photos of the correspondence between Seiko Hayase and her young Chinese friends on the entire first page. Seiko Hayase also received letters of encouragement from many young people across Japan. More and more Japanese young people hope to establish friendly correspondence with Chinese young friends.

    Now, we publish below excerpts from a letter from Seiko Hayase's mother introducing the situation of Seiko Hayase receiving replies, and letters from several other Japanese youths to the editor of this newspaper. In addition, Yoko Shiraishi (1773, Kozakura-cho, Takahagi City, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan), Kazuo Takeda (Kuriyama Junior High School, Kuriyama-cho, Yubari-gun, Hokkaido), Koji Kikuchi (27 Uehara-cho, Nakano-ku, Tokyo) and others have also written to express their hope to correspond with Chinese students. These letters could not be published due to space limitations.

    Letter from Seiko Hayase's mother
    People's Daily:

    Seiko has recently gone to the mountains to practice in order to participate in the Japan National Skiing Tournament. She is concentrating her efforts to win the championship in this year's national tournament.

    I (Seiko's mother) would like to thank you on behalf of Seiko and report on the reaction in Japan after Seiko's letter was published.

    Around December 20th of last year, Seiko began to receive letters full of sincere friendship, and she wrote back in reply. Then, the number of letters each day reached thirty or forty, and now it has exceeded 200. We cannot finish writing replies, so our whole family is helping her to reply. Although the replies are inevitably delayed, we will try our best to repay the kindness of the letter writers.

    We are moved by the sincere friendship of your country's youth. We do not regard people who use the same language and have the same blood as people from a distant foreign country, and sincerely hope that everyone will join hands and move forward in friendship.

    In the New Year, newspapers and radio stations (NHK) reported our situation to the whole of Japan, so letters of encouragement and letters from good friends and comrades from all over the country piled up like mountains. We want to ensure that the hopes of these people are fulfilled.

    This time, the sincere friendship of Chinese youth has set off a huge wave in Japan, which will form a great movement. I believe that the day when young people in Japan and China can make friends will not be far away.

    Letters from Shoji Risaki, Eiro Sato,
    Takumi Koyama, etc.

    Letter from Shoji Risaki, Inoue Post Office Area, Namerigata County, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan: I am writing this letter to you out of a sincere desire: to use the pen to deepen the friendship between us and the people of your country.

    Our country is a small country with an average of 240 people living per square kilometer. Now we feel isolated on the edge of the eastern part of the earth. As you know, Japan is the only country in the world that has entered the atomic age and suffered the bombing of the demonic atomic bomb, sacrificing hundreds of thousands of people. Therefore, we know more deeply how important peace and friendship are on this earth.

    Recently, I realized that no matter who, when, or where, strengthening close ties with friends from all over the world through friendly correspondence is conducive to peace. I think that if the hands of friendship are woven into a net, one day the world will be free of war.

    The ancestors of us Japanese have been in close contact with the people of your country since a long time ago. We have the same eyes, the same hair, and the same skin. We are the same race. Since this is the case, why can't we interact with each other now?

    Chinese friends, for the sake of peace, let us exchange letters of friendship! Even if you send tens of thousands of letters, I will definitely write back. If I don't have enough time to write alone, the young people of Japan will definitely write to you.

    Letter from Eiro Sato, Sendai Municipal Goko Bridge Junior High School, Japan: I am a second-year student at Goko Bridge Junior High School in Sendai City. Goko Bridge Junior High School won the championship in the national choir competition. I am about to become a third-year student and preparing for the high school entrance exam, so I am busy.

    There are 6 people in my family. My father was laid off from the Tohoku Electric Power Company in 1950. Recently, 50 people who were laid off from the electric power company in Kyushu, which is currently in the midst of a struggle, have been reinstated. My father said that those who were laid off from the electric power company in Sendai may also be reinstated one day. My mother is too fat and her health is not very good. My older brother is a second-year high school student. I also have two younger brothers.

    I would like to know more about China in detail, but this is very difficult. I would like to communicate with Chinese friends. (Please write in English or Japanese)

    Letter from Takumi Koyama, 829 Higashimachi, Yonezawa City, Yamagata Prefecture, Japan: I am a student studying electrical engineering at a technical high school. In 1953, I returned to Japan on the first repatriation ship "Takasago Maru." When I was in China, I studied in a Chinese elementary school for four years and got along very well with my Chinese friends. I still have memories of those friends in my mind. Yao Jianguo and Zhang Jianzhong are my best friends, and Tong Xiaohui, Wang Lanfeng, and Ye Lanxiang are all my friends. They were all my classmates at Tianshui Railway Elementary School in Gansu Province. Moreover, I am deeply grateful to the many teachers for taking care of me, but I don't know where they are now. I hope to communicate with Chinese friends and take this opportunity to make friends with Chinese people. I think this is the spirit of "People of the world are one family" that I learned in China. Let us strive towards it as our goal!

    Letter from Teruhiko Zawayama, 97 4-chome Tamagawa-cho, Fukushima-ku, Osaka City, Japan: I am a 16-year-old boy and am currently studying in high school. I enjoy collecting stamps. However, until today, I do not even have a single stamp from your country. Although local stamp dealers also sell your country's beautiful large stamps, they are all unused and sold in sets of 4 or 5, which are very expensive.

    There are 8 people in my family. My brother, sister, and I are in school. The family gives me 1,000 yen per month for tuition, and not much else. My older sister gives me a little bit of her earnings each month (200 yen), which I save to buy stamps as a pleasure. However, stamps from your country generally cost 150 to 200 yen per set here. The daily wage of a temporary worker in our country is generally around 250 to 300 yen, so in comparison, the price of stamps from your country is quite high.

    I think there may be people in your country who are willing to exchange used stamps with my stamps. I also think that while exchanging stamps, we can also exchange opinions on life and other aspects, thereby forming a deep friendship between the people of the two countries and promoting mutual understanding.

### 建立中日两国青年的友谊联系

    建立中日两国青年的友谊联系
    编者按：去年12月11日本报“读者来信专页”发表了日本青年早濑笙子的来信，她希望同中国的青年建立友谊的联系。早濑笙子这一友好的愿望，在中日两国青年中都引起了热烈的反响。我国各地许多青年给早濑笙子写去了友好的信，有的还寄去了照片、美术图片、邮票和书刊等。日本“朝日新闻”在1月6日报道说：“中国朋友的信蜂涌而来。”同日，“每日新闻”写道：“一个少女要和中国朋友友好的愿望实现了，中国青年男女一下子就给她寄来了200多封信”。“产经时事”报认为：这些年轻人们之间表示愿意“携手相好”的信，“引起了国际友好关系问题上一个愉快的话题”。日本“太阳写真新闻”在1月7日以整个第一版的篇幅，刊登了早濑笙子和中国青年朋友们互相通信情况的照片。早濑笙子并收到日本全国各地许多青年的鼓励信。希望同中国青年朋友们建立友好的通信联系的日本青年也越来越多了。
    现在把早濑笙子的母亲写来的介绍早濑笙子接到回信的情况的来信和另几位日本青年给本报编者来信的译文，摘要发表在下面。另外，还有白石阳子（日本茨城县高萩市小櫻町1773）、武田和夫（北海道夕张郡栗山町立栗山中学）、菊池孝次（东京中野区上原町27番地）等也来信希望同中国青年学生通讯。这些来信因篇幅关系未能刊出。
    早濑笙子的母亲的来信人民日报社：
    笙子最近因为要参加日本全国滑雪大会，到山中练习去了。她正在专心努力，争取在今年的全国大会上取得优胜。
    我（笙子的母亲）代表笙子向你们致谢意，并报告笙子的信发表后在日本的反应。
    去年12月20日前后起，笙子就开始收到充满真诚友谊的来信，她也就写出复信。接着，每天的来信多达三、四十封，现在已经超过200封了。复信写不完，我们一家都帮着她复信。虽然免不了要复迟了，但我们将努力答谢来信者的厚意。
    贵国青年的真诚友谊感动了我们。我们不把使用同样文字、流着同样血液的人当作距离遥远的异国人看待，真心希望大家友好地相互携手前进。
    新年，报纸和电台（日本广播协会）就把我们的情况向日本全国报道了，因而来自全国各地的鼓励信和好朋友们的、同志们的信堆积如山，我们想一定要使这些人们的希望得到满足。
    这次中国青年的真诚友谊，在日本全国掀起了巨浪，这将会形成一个大运动。我相信，日中两国青年达到能交友的日子，也一定不会远。
                  早濑安子（译音）
    理崎昭治、佐藤瑛郎、
    小山卓弥等的来信
    日本茨城县行方郡井上局区内理崎昭治的来信：我给您写这封信，是出于这样一个衷心愿望：想用笔来加深我们和贵国人民的友情。
    我们的国家是平均每一平方公里住着240人的小国。现在我们感到是在地球东方的边涯上孤立着。正如您所知道的，日本是世界进入原子能时代之后，遭受恶魔一样的原子弹的轰炸、牺牲了几十万人的唯一的国家，因而我们更加深切地知道，和平与友谊在这个地球上是多么重要的东西。
    最近，我意识到，不管是谁、什么时候、在什么地方，用友谊的通信和世界各国的朋友加强亲密的联系，是有助于和平的。我想，友谊的手编成网，总有一天会使世界不再有战争。
    我们日本人的祖先，很早以来就和贵国人民亲密地来往。我们生着同样的眼睛、同样的头发、同样的皮肤，是同样的人种。既然如此，为什么现在我们不能互相交往呢？
    中国的朋友们，为了和平，我们交换友谊的信件吧！即便你们寄来几万封信，我也一定写回信。如果我一个人来不及写，日本的青少年们也一定会给你们写的。
    日本仙台市市立五桥中学佐藤瑛郎的来信：我是仙台市五桥中学的二年级学生。五桥中学在全国合唱比赛中获得了优胜。我就要升为三年级生，准备高等学校的入学考试，因而忙起来。
    我的家庭共6人。我父亲在1950年为东北配电公司解雇，最近正在斗争中的九州地方曾被配电公司解雇的人，已有50名复职。我父亲说，仙台的被配电公司解雇的人，说不定那天也要复职的。我母亲太胖，身体不很好。我哥哥是高等学校二年级生。我还有两个弟弟。
    我很想详细地知道中国的情况，可是这非常困难。我想同中国的朋友通信。（写信请用英文或日文）
    日本山形县米沢市东町829番地小山卓弥的来信：我是在工业高等学校学电气的学生。我在1953年乘第一次日侨回国船“高砂丸”回到日本。我在中国的时候，在中国小学读过四年书，和中国的朋友们相处很好。到现在我的脑子中仍然留着我对那些朋友们的回忆。姚建国、张建中是我最好的朋友，佟小惠、王兰凤、叶兰香都是我的朋友，他们都是我在甘肃省天水市铁路小学时的同学。而且，我深深地感谢那许多老师对我的照顾，但是我不知道他们现在在那里。我希望和中国的朋友们通信，通过这个机会和中国人交朋友。我认为这就是我在中国学习的“全世界人民是一家”的精神。让我们把它作为目标而奋斗吧！
    日本大坂市福岛区玉川町四丁目97番
  地泽山辉彦的来信：我是一个16岁的男孩子，现在高等学校读书。我爱好收集邮票。可是，直到今天，我却连一张贵国的邮票都没有。虽然本地的邮票商人也出售贵国的美丽的大邮票，但都是没有用过的，而且4张或5张一套一套地卖，价钱很贵。
    我家中8口人，我和我哥哥、妹妹在校读书。家中每月给我学费1，000日圆，此外不再给多少钱了。我姊姊把她的劳动所得每月给我一点（200日圆），我把它节省下来买邮票作为乐事。可是，贵国的邮票在这里大抵要150到200日圆才能买一套。我国的临时雇工，每日工资一般是250到300日圆上下，比较起来，贵国的邮票价格就相当高了。
    我想，贵国也许有愿意以用过的邮票和我的邮票交换的人吧。我还想，在交换邮票的同时，我们也可以互相交换关于生活方面等的意见，从而结成两国人民深厚的友谊，促进相互之间的了解。
