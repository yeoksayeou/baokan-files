Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: The Manila Treaty Organization will hold large-scale military exercises near Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, from February 15th to 18th. The exercises will include joint land, sea, and air exercises, military equipment exhibitions, and troop reviews.

    The United States has decided to send its largest force to the region since the end of the war to participate in the exercises, including aircraft carriers, destroyers, a squadron of jet fighter-bombers, and Marines. The United Press said that the United States is doing this as the "most dramatic step" in providing support to the Manila Treaty Organization.

    Western news agency reports indicate that the United States chose to hold large-scale military exercises at this time to cheer up certain Manila Treaty Organization countries, showing that the Manila Treaty Organization has "teeth." The United Press revealed that the exercises were chosen to be held near Bangkok "because some people are worried that the country (Thailand) is turning from its anti-communist stance to a more independent foreign policy."

    威胁泰国的军事演习
    新华社讯　曼谷消息：马尼拉条约组织将在2月15日到18日在泰国首都曼谷附近举行大规模的军事演习。这次演习将包括陆、海、空军的联合演习、军事装备的展览和军队的检阅。
    美国已经决定派遣战后以来派到这个地区的最大的一支部队参加演习，其中包括航空母舰、驱逐舰、喷气式战斗轰炸机大队和海军陆战队。合众社说，美国这样做是作为给予马尼拉条约组织支持的一个“最具有戏剧性的步骤”。
    西方通讯社的消息表明，美国选择在这个时机举行大规模军事演习是为了给某些马尼拉条约组织国家打气，以表示马尼拉条约组织是有“牙齿”的。合众社透露，这次演习选择在曼谷附近举行，是“因为某方面人士担心那个国家（泰国）正从它反共的立场上转向比较独立的外交政策”。
