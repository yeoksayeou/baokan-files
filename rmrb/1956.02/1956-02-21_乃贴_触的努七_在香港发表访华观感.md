Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th - The 12-member Thai People's Promotion of Friendship to China Delegation arrived in Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 19th, after a month-long visit to China via Guangzhou.

The head of the delegation, Nai Tih-Touch Indranoochi, told Hong Kong reporters that he believed that China is sincerely peace-loving. He said that for the sake of the people's livelihood, China is working hard to build its own country. They believe that all countries in the world can coexist peacefully. Nai Tih said, "China is vast and rich in resources, they do not need to invade other countries. To say that China wants to invade other countries is a rumor made by the other side, and it is groundless."

Nai Tih said that China has made considerable progress compared to the past, and many new factories and buildings are under construction. The lives of the Chinese people are good.

Nai Tih pointed out that there has been a long-standing friendship between the Chinese and Thai people, and he hopes that various delegations can continue to be sent to visit China in the future to strengthen exchanges between the two sides.

He said that this visit by the Thai People's Promotion of Friendship to China Delegation has promoted mutual understanding between the Chinese and Thai people. He said that the policy of his party, the Economist Party, is to hope to live in friendship with all countries, and the people of Asian countries should have close exchanges.

When talking about Sino-Thai trade and the "embargo" issue, Nai Tih said, "The embargo is unjust." The "embargo" has resulted in difficulties in exporting Thai goods and lower prices for goods. He said that trade relations between China and Thailand should be gradually strengthened, which is the wish of the vast majority of Thai people. This is beneficial to the Thai people.
