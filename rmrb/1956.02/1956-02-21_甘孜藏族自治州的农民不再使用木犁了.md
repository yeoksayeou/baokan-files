    Farmers in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture No Longer Use Wooden Ploughs
    Wu Wei
    Just a few years ago, Tibetan farmers in the eastern part of the Kangzang Plateau still used wooden farm tools and primitive "slash-and-burn" methods for cultivation. People scattered seeds on the ground and covered them with a layer of soil using crude wooden ploughs, considering the sowing complete. Because there were no hoes, the land could not be processed. Weeding hoes were made from forked branches, and even sickles were made of wood. Relying on such primitive production tools and methods, the harvest was generally only three to four times the amount of seeds sown.
    After liberation, the state provided them with huge financial assistance in order to help the Tibetan people change their backward economic conditions. In the second year of the establishment of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (now part of Sichuan Province) – 1951 – a comprehensive plan was drafted, deciding to completely change the "slash-and-burn" method within a few years. Now, this plan is being gradually implemented. Over the past few years, the state has distributed more than 350,000 pieces of iron farm tools to farmers free of charge, with each household receiving an average of 5 pieces. At the same time, 42 agricultural technology extension stations have been established in the eastern 6 counties to gradually promote new animal-powered farm tools such as walking ploughs, seeders, and harvesters, and to provide agricultural production technical guidance. Now, in most parts of the autonomous prefecture, wooden ploughs and wooden hoes have become relics of history. In some places, new animal-powered farm tools have already appeared.
    At first, Tibetan farmers were not used to using iron farm tools. Han Chinese cadres went deep into the fields to teach them. In Ganzi, Daocheng and other counties, the hoes were pre-assembled with wooden handles before being distributed to the farmers. In addition, short-term training classes were held in various places to train new farm tool operators. In this way, Tibetan farmers became more and more skilled in mastering various new farm tools. Recently, I went to Muya District, Kangding County, the largest agricultural area in the autonomous prefecture, where more than 2,000 farmers are using iron farm tools. In Zhongxia Village, half of the land is sown using horse-drawn seeders. People told me that they have not used the wooden ploughs left by their ancestors for several years, and they no longer spend all day busy going up the mountain to cut oak trees to make ploughshares.
    From using wooden ploughs to using iron farm tools and animal-powered farm tools, it is a leap forward in agricultural production for the Tibetan people. With the development of technology promotion work, the production appearance of the autonomous prefecture has changed rapidly. In the past, people used wooden ploughs to cultivate the land, and could only dig up a thin layer of soil on the surface; after changing to iron ploughshares for ploughing, the depth was twice that of wooden ploughs; and using new animal-powered farm tools, not only is the ploughing deeper and the sowing more even, but the work efficiency is much higher than manual labor. In this way, farmers have the strength to carry out more detailed cultivation. Now Tibetan farmers have changed their habit of not doing autumn ploughing. In 1955, many places also carried out one shallow ploughing and one deep ploughing, because this can eliminate weeds and kill pests by freezing. In the past, Tibetan farmers never weeded or fertilized, but now, in some areas, Tibetan people have put forward the slogan of "not leaving a single weed," and Tibetan people can be seen everywhere digging hairy pits for composting. With the help of agricultural technology extension stations, farmers in some areas have also learned how to make compost and bone ash. The improved varieties of "Nanda 2419" wheat and six-rowed qingke promoted by state-owned farms are gradually replacing the old varieties. In the summer of 1955, I saw farmers in Batang County using new iron hoes to repair irrigation ditches. Now there are more than 260 irrigation ditches built throughout the state, and many drylands have been irrigated.
    The Kangzang Plateau has fertile black soil and abundant rainfall. After improving the farm tools, the production potential of the land has been further utilized. The average yield of Dalaxi Village, Kangding County, in 1954 was double that of 1952. Daiwa Rangbu, a county labor model, created a record of 600 jin of wheat per mu in 1955. The qingke yield in Daofu County generally exceeded the Xikang Province's high-yield reward standard. Angwang Cilie, a member of the Communist Youth League, produced more than 530 jin of qingke per mu. In the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, it is not uncommon to produce more than 3,000 jin of potatoes per mu. The radishes and Chinese cabbage here weigh more than 20 jin each. The autonomous prefecture increased its grain production by more than 45.2 million jin in 1955 compared to 1951, which means that the total output increased by more than 35%. Over the past few years, more than 10,000 households of landless and land-poor farmers in the state have also reclaimed nearly 100,000 mu of wasteland. Zhaqu Heba in Ganzi County used to be a desolate grassland, but now, more than 20 farmers from nearby counties have reclaimed it, built houses, and established their own homes. There are many new villages like this in many places. When we walk on the plateau, what we see is no longer a desolate scene.
    The lives of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture are improving year by year. In Batang County, known as the "Jiangnan outside the Pass," before liberation, many people picked a poisonous wild grass called "huoma" as food in late spring and early summer. Now, Batang County has surplus grain every year to support neighboring counties. The purchasing power of farmers in Muya District, Kangding County, has doubled compared to 1953. At the same time, because of the development of agricultural production, the phenomenon of livestock areas relying on milk residue and wild ginseng fruit for food all year round is gone forever. The Tibetan people sing about their lives today like this:
    The sun rises from the east
    As if Chairman Mao asked us how we are doing
    We don't know how to answer
    We can only ask him
    Look at the redness on our faces!

    甘孜藏族自治州的农民不再使用木犁了
    吴畏
    仅仅在几年以前，康藏高原东部的藏族农民还是用木质农具和“刀耕火种”的原始方式来从事耕作的。人们把种籽撒在地上，用粗劣的木犁盖上一层土，就算完成了播种。因为没有锄头，土地不能进行加工。锄草用的薅锄是用一种有叉的树枝做成的，甚至镰刀也是木头做的。依靠这样原始的生产工具和生产方法，收获量一般只有种籽的三、四倍。
    解放以后，国家为了帮助藏族人民改变经济落后状态，在财政上给了他们以巨大的援助。甘孜藏族自治州（现属四川省）成立的第二年——1951年，就拟订了全面的计划，决定在几年内完全改变“刀耕火种”的方法。现在，这个计划正在逐步实现中。几年来，国家已经把35万多件铁质农具无偿地发到了农民手里，每个农户平均得到了5件铁质农具。同时，在东部6县建立了42个农业技术推广站，逐步推广步犁、播种机、收割机等新式畜力农具，并且进行农业生产技术指导。现在，在自治州的绝大部分地区，木犁、木锄已经成为历史上的遗迹。有些地方，已经出现了新式畜力农具。
    起初，藏族农民都不习惯使用铁质农具。外来的汉族干部就深入到田间去教他们。在甘孜、稻城等县，还事先把锄头装好了木柄，再发给农民。另外，各地开办了短期训练班来培养新式农具手。这样，藏族农民越来越熟练地掌握了各种新农具。最近，我曾到自治州最大的一个农业区——康定县木雅区去，那里，两千多户农民都使用着铁质农具。在仲霞村，有一半土地是使用马拉播种机播种的。人们告诉我，他们已经几年没有使用祖辈留下来的木犁，也不再成天忙着上山去砍青杠树来做铧口了。
    从使用木犁到使用铁质农具和畜力农具，对藏族人民的农业生产来说是一个飞跃的进步。加上技术推广工作的展开，自治州的生产面貌有了迅速的改变。过去，人们用木犁耕地，只能掘起地面一层薄薄的土；改用铁铧翻土以后，比木犁就要深耕一倍；而使用新式畜力农具，不仅耕得更深，播种得均匀，工作效率比起人力来要高得多。这样，农民们就有力量来进行更精细的耕作。现在藏族农民都已改变了不进行秋耕的习惯。1955 年，许多地方还进行了一次浅耕，一次深耕，因为这样可以消灭杂草和冻杀害虫。过去藏族农民从来不锄草，不施肥，现在，有些地区的藏民提出了“不留一根杂草”的口号，各处都可以看见藏民在挖毛坑沤肥。一些地方的农民在技术推广站的帮助下，还学会了制造堆肥和骨灰的办法。由国营农场推广的良种“南大二四一九”小麦和六棱青稞，正在逐渐代替旧的品种。1955年夏天，我在巴塘县看见农民们正在用新的铁锄修水渠。现在全州兴修的水渠有260多条，许多旱地都得到了灌溉。
    康藏高原有肥沃的黑土，充沛的雨量。在改进了农具以后，土地的生产潜力就更大地发挥出来了。康定县达拉西村1954年的平均产量比1952年增加一倍。县劳动模范戴瓦让布在1955年创造了每亩小麦产600斤的纪录。道孚县的青稞产量普遍超过了原西康省丰产奖励标准。青年团员昂汪次烈的青稞每亩产530多斤。在甘孜藏族自治州，每亩洋芋产3，000斤以上的并不算稀罕。这里的萝卜和莲花白每个有20多斤重。自治州1955年比1951年增产了4，520多万斤粮食，就是说，总产量增加了35％强。全州1万多户无地和少地的农民，几年来还开垦了近10万亩荒地。甘孜县札区河坝，过去是一片荒无人迹的草地，现在，由附近几县来的20多户农民在这里开垦，修筑了房屋，建立了自己的家园。像这样的新村许多地方都有。当我们在高原上行走的时候，看到的再不是一片荒凉的景象了。
    自治州各族人民的生活正在一年年地上升。在号称为“关外江南”的巴塘县，解放前每逢春末夏初的时候，许多人都采摘一种有毒的野草“活麻”来当粮食吃。现在，巴塘县每年都有余粮支援邻近的县份。康定县木雅区农民的购买力比1953年提高了两倍。同时，因为农业生产的发展，畜牧地区终年用奶渣子和野生的人参果充饥的现象也一去不返了。藏族人民这样歌唱着他们今天的生活：
    太阳从东方升起
    好像毛主席问我们日子过得怎样
    我们不知道怎样回答
    只有请他老人家
    看看我们脸上的红光！（附图片）
