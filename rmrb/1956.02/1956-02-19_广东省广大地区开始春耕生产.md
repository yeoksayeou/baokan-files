In Guangdong Province, at the southern end of the motherland's mainland, the first swallows have returned from the distant ocean, and farmers have begun spring ploughing from the Han River Plain in the east to the Leizhou Peninsula in the west.

Many agricultural production cooperatives in Chao'an, Chenghai, Xuwen and other counties have sown their first batch of seeds earlier than in previous years, and have generally adopted advanced cultivation methods such as cold soaking to promote germination and the "He" style of seedling raising. The Yunguang Agricultural Production Cooperative, led by Lin Yancheng, who set a national record of 2,020 jin of rice per mu, also implemented dry sowing to cultivate strong seedlings, in order to focus on promoting single-plant close planting and strive to increase production by 50 to 100 jin per mu compared with small-plant close planting. In Hainan Island, where the season starts earliest, more than 1 million mu of rice fields have already been planted with seedlings.

This year, broad areas of Guangdong Province have earnestly carried out preparatory work for spring ploughing at an early stage. Seven counties in the province have already achieved "10,000 jin of fertilizer accumulated per mu," including Chenghai County, which averaged 37,800 jin of fertilizer accumulated per mu of rice field.

In order to promote a province-wide upsurge in spring ploughing production, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China organized eight inspection teams with more than 60 people, including Provincial Party Secretary Tao Zhu, and set off from the 15th to inspect work in various places.

While the north of the motherland is still covered in ice and snow, Guangzhou is already in full bloom. On the eve of the Spring Festival, Guangzhou held its annual grand flower market. People flocked to the flower market like a tide to admire and buy their favorite flowers. Our reporter, Na Yi, took this picture.

    广东省广大地区开始春耕生产
    第一群燕子已经从遥远的海洋那边回到祖国大陆南端的广东省，东起韩江平原，西至雷州半岛，广大农民开始了春耕生产。
    潮安和澄海、徐闻等县的许多农业生产合作社，都比往年提早播下了第一批种子，并且普遍采用了冷浸催芽、合式秧田等先进耕作方法。以每亩水稻产量2，020斤创造全国最高纪录的林炎城领导的云光农业生产合作社，还实行了旱播培育壮秧，以便重点推广单株密植，争取每亩比小株密植增产50斤到100斤。季节最早的海南岛，插下秧的稻田已经有100多万亩。
    今年广东省广大地区及早认真地进行了备耕工作。全省已经出现了7个“每亩积肥万斤县”，其中澄海县平均每亩稻田积肥37，800斤。
    为了推动全省掀起春耕生产热潮，中共广东省委员会组织了有省委书记陶铸等60多个人参加的8个检查组，从15日起分别出发到各地检查工作。（附图片）
    祖国的北方还是一片冰雪，而广州已是百花怒放了。春节前夕，广州市举行了一年一度的盛大的花市。人们像潮水一样涌到花市欣赏和选购心爱的花卉。本报记者　纳一摄
