I listened to Premier Zhou's political report and the reports of various leaders, and I wholeheartedly endorse them with great excitement. Although this is my first time attending the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I do not feel unfamiliar with this meeting. Because I often "get close" to the central leaders through newspapers, repeatedly studying the country's guidelines and policies; I also often read the speeches made by the members, which gradually improved my understanding of socialist thought. Especially Chairman Mao's instructions at the symposium held in late October last year when he invited the members of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce to teach us to understand the laws of social development and grasp our own destiny, which made me more clearly recognize the path forward.

I have been running Yuhua, Daxing, and Dahua Textile Companies and Lihua Coal Mine in Wuhan for more than 30 years, and I am a thoroughbred bourgeois element. Before liberation, I did not understand the principles of revolution, nor had I studied Marxism-Leninism, and I had no understanding of communism. Moreover, at that time, secret agents made many distorted and slanderous propaganda against the Party, which made me even more suspicious and fearful. In particular, Shi Fengxiang, the general manager of Yuhua, Dahua, and Daxing Companies, was a stumbling block for me, and almost led me to make the big mistake of setting up a factory in Taiwan. He was a relative of the reactionary boss Chiang Kai-shek. Before liberation, he wanted to set up a factory in Taiwan and transported 11,000 dan of cotton from the Dahua Yarn Factory in Xi'an, and prepared to ship the spinning machines ordered in England. At that time, I also had the idea of ​​"watching the wind and steering the rudder and a rabbit having three burrows," so I agreed to his method, wanting to transfer these properties to Taiwan to seek the protection of the reactionary government and retreat for myself. Fortunately, Tianjin and Beiping were liberated soon after, and I learned about the Communist Party's industrial and commercial policies; and heard that the Jinan Yarn Factory was still in normal production, my thinking changed drastically, and I was unwilling to disperse the property in Taiwan. I decided not to set up a factory in Taiwan, resolutely broke up with Shi Fengxiang, and still shipped 36,000 spindles of British spinning machines back to the country for production.

Although I refused to set up a factory in Taiwan, my suspicion and fear of the Communist Party had not disappeared. The relocation of Yuhua, Dahua, and Daxing Companies from Hankou to Chongqing before the liberation of 1949 was caused by this suspicion and fear. In the autumn of that year, I was in Chongqing and learned that the People's Government had returned the Daxing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang after trusteeship, which moved me greatly. At that time, Chen Zhongbi, the supervisor of Daxing, asked me to apply for joint state-private ownership of Daxing and introduced me to Comrade Liao Chengzhi of the Central Party Committee in Beijing. But because my company had three factories in Sichuan, and Chongqing had not yet been liberated at that time, I had concerns and did not dare to have a deeper connection with the Party, so I only sent Deputy General Manager Su Xianqin to Beijing to handle the takeover. If I could have put aside my personal interests at that time and had the determination to believe in the Party, Daxing would have been jointly owned long ago, and Yuhua and Dahua would not have been delayed until 1951 to enter joint state-private ownership. Now looking back, the failure to take a step forward in the transformation of enterprises and individuals caused irreparable losses to the country and the people.

In the early days of liberation, due to the difficulties brought about by the old society, the production of various factories was not good, and the system was chaotic. At that time, I suspected that the Party could only lead military and political revolutions, and could destroy the three-thousand-year-old feudal system and defeat the 6 million American-equipped reactionaries, but could not lead production. But in the past few years, facts have proved that since my company entered joint state-private ownership in 1951, under the direct leadership of socialist economic components, relying on all employees, and after a series of production reforms, the production of each factory has greatly developed. Every year, the national production tasks are overfulfilled, labor productivity is gradually increased, employee welfare is correspondingly improved, product costs are continuously reduced, enterprise profits are gradually increased, and the factory's production equipment has also been improved and expanded. The capitalists also receive considerable dividends every year. I will only present two factories and compare the production situation before the joint venture in 1951 with that in 1955: the total output value of Yuhua E Factory increased by 350%, and Dahua Qin Factory increased by 173%; the profit increase of E Factory was 1,314%, and Qin Factory was 143%; the hourly output of cotton yarn per thousand spindles increased by 25% in E Factory and 38% in Qin Factory; the average unit cotton consumption decreased by 6% in E Factory and 9% in Qin Factory; labor productivity increased by 37% in E Factory and 81% in Qin Factory; the unit labor cost decreased by 33% in E Factory and 39% in Qin Factory. At the same time, in joint ventures, under the direct leadership and education of the public side and the help of employees, the ideological transformation of capitalists and capitalist agents in daily work has made continuous progress, and their business and political levels have also improved to a certain extent. The benefits of joint ventures are endless, and I deeply realize that the achievement of these results is inseparable from the leadership of the Party and the government. As long as we honestly accept the path indicated by the Party and the government and move forward, our future will be bright.

The personal transformation of the bourgeoisie must go through arduous ideological struggles, is gradual, and is gradually improved. I remember when the Resist America and Aid Korea movement began in 1950, when my second son, Huang Liyan, wanted to join the Chinese People's Volunteers, although I did not refuse, I did not express my agreement either. At that time, I had serious fear of America. Later, seeing the continuous victories of the Volunteers and the step-by-step failure of the American imperialism, I realized that with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are no longer afraid of imperialist aggression. After the Korean War achieved a peaceful victory, my son was demobilized and employed, and took up a job. Now his kindness to his younger siblings, his enthusiasm for labor, and his love for the motherland are completely different before and after joining the army. The life of the People's Army is not only a revolutionary school but also a melting pot of excellent qualities. Now the Conscription Law gives everyone's children the opportunity to serve in the military, not only fulfilling their due responsibilities to defend the motherland, but also, after training, becoming citizens of excellent quality. When my third son reaches the age, I will definitely encourage him to register for service.

I have lived an exploitative life for more than 30 years without understanding the meaning of exploitation. I thought that running factories and opening coal mines to support thousands upon thousands of workers, and "saving the country through industry" was not a bad thing, and I was always unconvinced when I heard that I was an exploiting class. After a long period of learning and experience, and seeing with my own eyes the contrast between the lives of workers before and after liberation: in the past, they could not get enough to eat or wear warm clothes, and could never escape poverty; now they produce for the people, their lives are improving day by day, and they live happily. Only then did I realize the sins of the exploiting class. The state's transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, implementing peaceful transformation and redemption policies, can be said to be caring for the capitalists in every possible way. Shouldn't we accept the transformation consciously with gratitude, learn from the working class, and strive to join their glorious ranks as soon as possible? What else is there to be nostalgic about regarding the ownership of the means of production?

Our country's socialist transformation is developing forward at a greater speed. With the unprecedented development of agricultural collectivization, the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry and commerce of capitalism has also reached a climax. But after the joint state-private ownership, this is only the beginning of further in-depth transformation. There is still a series of work such as asset inventory and verification, economic reorganization, enterprise transformation, production arrangements, and personnel arrangements that must be done seriously. I must not only transform myself so that I can change from today's exploiter to tomorrow's laborer; but also, under the leadership of the Party and the government, participate in the movement, and give full play to the active role of core members in the joint transformation. Combining my own personal experience, I will conduct extensive publicity and in-depth assistance among industrialists and businessmen, so that everyone has a clear understanding and firm confidence in the cause of socialist transformation and their own bright future, and together, under the glorious light of the Party, bravely move forward on the socialist path.

    黄师让的发言
    我听了周总理的政治报告和各首长的报告，我以极兴奋的心情完全拥护。我今天虽然首次列席中国人民政治协商会议，但我对这次大会并不感觉陌生。因我在报纸上常和中央首长接近，一次一次的学习国家的方针政策；也常读到各位委员发表的言论，使我对社会主义思想认识逐步提高。尤其是去年10月底毛主席在邀请中华全国工商业联合会执行委员会委员们举行的座谈会上的指示，教导我们认识社会发展规律，掌握自己的命运，使我更明确认清了前进的道路。
    我在武汉经营裕华、大兴、大华纺织公司和利华煤矿，30多年，是一个道地的资产阶级分子。解放前我不懂得革命的道理，更没有学习过马克思列宁主义，对于共产主义毫无认识。并且当时特务分子对党作了许多歪曲和诬蔑的宣传，更使我怀疑和恐惧。尤其裕华、大华、大兴三公司总经理石凤翔，是我的绊脚石，几乎使我铸成台湾设厂的大错。他是反动头子蒋介石的亲家，解放前夕，他想在台湾办厂，把西安大华纱厂的棉花运走了11，000担，并且准备起运在英国所订的纱机。我当时也有看风使舵狡兔三窟的思想，就同意他的办法，想把这些财产移转台湾，求得反动政府的保护，作个人的退步。所幸不久平津解放，知道了共产党的工商政策；又听见济南纱厂照常生产，我的思想才有急骤的转变，才不愿意将财产分散在台湾，决定不在台湾设厂，毅然和石凤翔分手，仍将英国纱机36，000锭运回国内生产。
    虽然我拒绝在台湾设厂，但我对共产党的怀疑和恐惧还未消失，裕华、大华、大兴总公司于1949年解放前夕，由汉口移迁重庆，就是这种怀疑和恐惧在作怪。这年秋天，我在重庆，得悉人民政府有将石家庄大兴纱厂由代管而发还的消息，我甚感动。当时大兴的监察人陈仲璧要我申请大兴公私合营，介绍我去北京会中央党委廖承志同志。但因为我公司有三个厂在四川，当时重庆尚未解放，我有顾虑，还不敢与党发生较深的联系，仅派副总经理苏先勤赴京办理接收。要是我当时能撇开个人的利害，有相信党的决心，大兴早就合营了，裕华、大华也就不会推迟到1951年才进入公私合营，现在回想起来，企业和个人的改造，未能跨前一步，这对国家和人民所受的损失，是无法补偿的。
    在解放初期，因旧社会带来的困难，各厂生产不好，制度紊乱。我当时怀疑党只会领导军事政治革命，能摧毁三千年的封建制度，能打垮美式装备的反动派600万军队，而不会领导生产。但几年来，事实证明：我公司自1951年进入公私合营之后，在社会主义经济成分直接领导下，依靠全体职工，经过一系列的生产改革，各厂生产均有很大发展，每年均超额完成国家生产任务，劳动生产率逐步增长，职工福利相应提高，产品成本不断降低，企业利润逐步增加，厂的生产设备也有改进与扩充，资方每年也分到相当的股息。我仅提出两个厂，把1951年合营前，和1955年的生产情况作个对比：裕华鄂厂总产值的增长为350％，大华秦厂为173％；利润的增加鄂厂为1，314％，秦厂为143％；棉纱千锭时产量鄂厂增加25％，秦厂增加38％；平均单位用棉量鄂厂降低6％，秦厂降低9％；劳动生产率鄂厂提高37％，秦厂提高81％；单位工费成本鄂厂降低33％，秦厂降低39％。同时在合营企业里，资方和资方代理人在日常工作中，在公方直接的领导教育和职工的帮助下，思想改造有不断的进步，业务和政治水平也有一定的提高。合营的好处是一时说不尽的，我深深体会到这些成绩的获得，是与党和政府的领导分不开的。只要我们老老实实接受党和政府所指示的路线前进，我们的前途是光芒万丈的。
    资产阶级的个人改造，必须要经过艰苦的思想斗争，是渐进的，是逐步提高的。我记得1950年抗美援朝运动开始，我的次子黄立言要去参加中国人民志愿军的时候，我虽没有拒绝，但也未表示同意。我当时恐美思想严重。后来看见志愿军的节节胜利，美帝的步步失败，才认识到中国人民有了中国共产党的领导，再不怕帝国主义的侵略了。朝鲜战争取得和平胜利之后，我的儿子复员就业，走上工作岗位。他现在对弟妹的亲切，劳动的积极，和对祖国的热爱，参军前后，判若两人。人民军队的生活，不独是革命的学校，也是优良品质的熔炉。现在兵役法给每个人的子弟都有服役的机会，不独为保卫祖国尽了应尽的责任，而且经过锻炼，更可成为优良品质的公民。我的三子及龄我一定要鼓励他报名服役。
    我过了30多年的剥削生活，而不懂得剥削的意义，以为我办工厂开煤矿，养活上千上万的工人，“实业救国”并不是坏事，听说我是剥削阶级总不服气。经过长期学习、体会，并亲眼看到工人们解放前后生活的对比：以前他们吃不饱穿不暖，永远不能摆脱贫困；现在他们为人民生产，生活一天一天的提高，过着快乐日子，我才认识剥削阶级的罪恶。国家对资本主义工商业的改造，实行和平改造，赎买政策，可说是对资本家的照顾，无微不至。难道我们还不以感激的心情，自觉地接受改造，向工人阶级学习，争取早日走进他们的光荣行列么？对生产资料所有制，还有什么留恋么。
    我国社会主义改造，正在以更大的速度向前发展。随着农业合作化的空前发展，资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营，也跟着进到了高潮。但在公私合营后，这仅是进一步深入改造的开始。还有清产核资，经济改组，企业改造，生产安排，人事安排等一系列的工作，要认真去做。我不但要实行改造自己，以便由今天的剥削者，变成明天的劳动者；还要在党和政府的领导下，投入运动，在合营改造中，充分发挥核心分子的积极作用。结合自己亲身的体会，在工商业者中进行广泛宣传，深入帮助，要大家对于社会主义改造事业，和自己的光明前途，有明确认识，坚定信心，共同在党的光辉照耀下，奋勇向着社会主义途程前进。
