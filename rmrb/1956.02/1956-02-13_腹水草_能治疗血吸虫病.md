"Ascites Grass" Can Treat Schistosomiasis
    Liu Fan Zheng Feng

    "Ascites Grass" has a very good effect on treating schistosomiasis patients in the ascites stage. Over the past six months, according to clinical experiments conducted by the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Medical College and Changshan County Health Center on 61 cases, and follow-up reports three months after the patients were discharged (follow-up checks were performed on 52 cases), 37 cases experienced complete disappearance or reduction of abdominal distension, accounting for 71.1% of the total number of cases checked; 33 cases experienced increased appetite, accounting for 63.5%; 39 cases experienced mental recovery or improvement, accounting for 75%; 34 cases experienced a significant increase or improvement in labor capacity, accounting for 65.4%; and 39 cases experienced spleen shrinkage, accounting for 75%. In addition, 9 cases no longer had parasite eggs found in their stool (of which 4 cases were still positive by rectal biopsy). So far, although no evidence has been found that "Ascites Grass" can kill adult worms in the body, its effects on alleviating symptoms, increasing appetite, and restoring health in schistosomiasis patients in the ascites stage are very significant. For example, Wei Jichang, a schistosomiasis patient in the ascites stage from Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, who had been bedridden for a long time, was treated with "Ascites Grass" by the Changshan County Health Center in August 1955. After resting at home for three months, he was able to go to the fields to work and carry a load of 70 jin (35kg). Last November, he walked 60 li (30km) of mountain road from Yushan County, Jiangxi to Changshan County Health Center for a check-up and did not feel tired. Another example is patient Hua Zenggan, whose spleen was originally enlarged to 10.5 cm. After treatment with "Ascites Grass," it gradually shrunk to 2 cm. Now his appetite and spirit have returned to normal, and he can carry a load of 120 jin (60kg) up the mountain. Many patients have been able to participate in labor production after being treated with "Ascites Grass," and their physical strength is stronger than before treatment. Generally, they can carry heavy loads of 50 to 150 jin (25kg to 75kg).

    The use of "Ascites Grass" to treat schistosomiasis is said to have originated nearly a hundred years ago when a famine refugee from Fengyang County, Anhui Province, came to Zhejiang and made a living by selling medicinal herbs to treat diseases, and thus it spread in Changshan County, Zhejiang. According to the identification of medicinal plant specimens by the medicinal plant group of the Zhejiang Provincial "Ascites Grass" Schistosomiasis Treatment Research and Promotion Committee, this medicinal herb is "Aphanostemma sessiliflorum," also called "Tiger Tail Sundew." In Changshan County, in addition to the name "Ascites Grass," the masses also named it "Two-Headed Snake," "Two-Headed Bud," "Three-Section Two Stems," and "Fairy Bridge Grass" according to the shape of the grass. "Ascites Grass" is widely produced. The mountainous areas and coastal areas of Zhejiang, as well as Jiangxi, Anhui, Sichuan and other provinces, all grow "Ascites Grass." According to a production survey in 14 counties and cities including Changshan, Jiande, Hang County, and the suburbs of Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the yield is estimated to be over 150,000 jin (75,000kg). The cultivation method of Ascites Grass is very simple. Whether using artificial root division and transplanting or stem layering, its survival rate is very high; and it can be harvested and dried in mid-October to November each year and stored for future use. The roots, stems, and leaves can all be used as medicine, but the roots and stems are the main part, and the leaves are secondary. The method of preparing the medicine is: one liang (50g) of dried "Ascites Grass" is added to one jin (500ml) of water; first bring to a boil over high heat, then simmer over low heat. The decocted medicinal juice is concentrated to half, and then it can be taken. During medication and recuperation, patients must avoid eating foods with high water content and foods that are not easily digestible, and eat less salt.

    Last July, more than 20 representatives of Chinese and Western medicine from Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces visited Zhejiang to learn from the experience of using "Ascites Grass" to treat schistosomiasis. At present, the Zhejiang Provincial "Ascites Grass" Schistosomiasis Treatment Research and Promotion Committee has decided to comprehensively promote the use of "Ascites Grass" to treat schistosomiasis throughout the province, and will hold training courses on the treatment of schistosomiasis with "Ascites Grass" in schistosomiasis-endemic areas. In order to further study the therapeutic effect of "Ascites Grass," the committee is, on the one hand, planning to combine clinical experiments to improve the dosage form of the "Ascites Grass" decoction and reduce side effects; on the other hand, it is actively conducting follow-up observations of patients after discharge, further analyzing the therapeutic effect of "Ascites Grass" on schistosomiasis, and formulating standard treatment plans.

    “腹水草”能治疗血吸虫病
    刘凡  正峰
    “腹水草”治疗血吸虫病腹水期病人，效果很好。半年来，根据浙江医学院附属第一医院和常山县卫生院61个病例的临床实验，和病人出院后三个月的追踪检查报告来看（追踪检查了52个病例），病人腹部饱胀感已完全消失或减轻的有37例，占检查总病例数的71.1％；食量增加的有33例，占63.5％；精神恢复或好转的有39例，占75％；劳动力显著提高或有进步的有34例，占65.4％；脾脏缩小的有39例，占75％。此外，还有9个病例在大便中已没有找到虫卵（其中曾有4例用直肠活体组织检查仍属阳性）。观察到目前止，虽然还没有找出“腹水草”有杀灭体内成虫的证据，但它在减轻血吸虫病腹水期病人的症状、增加食欲、恢复健康等方面的效果是非常显著的。例如，江西省玉山县有一个长期不能起床的血吸虫病腹水期病人魏吉昌，1955年8月经常山县卫生院用“腹水草”治疗后，在家休养了三个月，就能下田工作，并且能挑70斤重的担子。去年11月他从江西玉山县步行60里的山路到常山县卫生院复查，也没有感到疲劳。又如病人华增干，脾脏原来肿大到10.5公分，经用“腹水草”治疗后，渐渐缩小到2公分，现在食量和精神都恢复了正常，上山也可挑120斤重的担子。许多病人经用“腹水草”治疗以后，都能参加劳动生产，体力比治疗前增强，一般都能挑50至150斤的重担。
    “腹水草”治疗血吸虫病，据传说是早年安徽凤阳县一个逃荒的灾民，到浙江以卖药草治病糊口而流传在浙江常山县的，到现在已有近百年的历史。据浙江省“腹水草”治疗血吸虫病研究推广委员会生药组根据生药标本的鉴定，这种药草就是“光叶爬崖红”，也叫“虎尾悬铃草”。在常山县除“腹水草”的名称之外，群众还按这种草的形状起名“两头蛇”、“两头芽”、“三节两梗”和“仙桥草”等名。“腹水草”的产地很广，浙江山区和沿海一带以及江西、安徽、四川等省，都生长有“腹水草”。根据浙江常山、建德、杭县、杭州市郊等14个县市的产量调查，约在15万斤以上。腹水草的培殖方法很简单，无论用人工分根移栽或用茎压条栽培法，它的成活率都很高；而且每年10月中旬至11月采掘晒干后，就可贮藏待用。其根、茎、叶全部均可作药，但以根、茎为主，叶为次。药物的配制方法是：干“腹水草”一两加水一斤；先用大火烧，后用小火煎，煎煮的药汁浓缩到一半，就可以服用。病人在服药和休养期间必须禁忌吃水分多和不容易消化的食物，少吃盐。
    去年7月，江苏、安徽、江西、湖北、湖南、广东、广西和云南等省曾派中西医代表20多人前往浙江访问，学习了用“腹水草”治疗血吸虫病的经验。目前，浙江省“腹水草”治疗血吸虫病研究推广委员会决定在全省全面推广用“腹水草”治疗血吸虫病，并且在血吸虫病流行的地区举办“腹水草”治疗血吸虫病训练班。该委员会为了进一步研究“腹水草”的治疗效果，一面有计划地结合临床实验，改良“腹水草”煎剂的剂型，减少副作用；一面积极进行病人出院后的追踪观察，进一步分析“腹水草”治疗血吸虫病的效果，定出标准的治疗方案。
