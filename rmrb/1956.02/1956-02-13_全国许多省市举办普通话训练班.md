Many provinces and cities across the country are holding Mandarin training classes.

The education administrative departments in many provinces across the country are holding teacher training classes to train primary and secondary school teachers to teach in Mandarin.

Jiangsu Province has already held three Mandarin teacher training classes. Counties and cities have also successively launched Mandarin training programs for primary school teachers, with plans to complete the training of all first-grade Chinese language teachers in the province before the summer vacation this year. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has also compiled a comparison table of dialects and Mandarin for 4 special districts, which has been distributed to various locations for reference. After training, first-grade Chinese language teachers in primary schools in Hebei Province have all learned phonetic symbols and are lecturing according to standard pronunciation. After the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Education organized a Mandarin training class for primary school principals and Chinese language teachers, it also held Mandarin training classes for primary school teachers in various counties and cities. The first phase of Mandarin training classes in Fujian, Henan, Hubei and other provinces have ended one after another. After the Mandarin training class organized by the Fujian Provincial Department of Education ended, more than 170 trainees went to various counties to serve in Mandarin training classes for primary school teachers. Some primary and secondary schools in Guizhou Province have adopted methods such as weekend evening parties or poetry recitation competitions to promote Mandarin.

Xinhua News Agency: The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau held a Mandarin training class for middle and primary school teachers from January 20 to February 9. More than 600 teachers who participated in the study learned to pronounce, spell, and read texts in Beijing pronunciation in 20 days.
