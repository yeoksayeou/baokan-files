    Builders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge
    Master the Latest Bridge Construction Methods
    The builders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have mastered the complex technology of the world's most advanced bridge construction method - the caisson drilling method. When the workers manufactured the first steel cofferdam for the bridge pier, it took them two months. However, recently, manufacturing the last two steel cofferdams for the bridge piers only took a total of 40 days. The large caissons required by the new construction method are several times thicker than the pipe piles used for the Han River Railway Bridge and the Han River Highway Bridge. The efficiency of the loading and unloading workers in sinking the caissons has increased by nearly two-thirds compared to their efficiency when driving piles for the Han River Highway Bridge a year ago. In early January, after China's first large-scale vibratory pile driver was used at the bridge construction site, the speed of sinking the caissons was more than doubled.
    Not long ago, the workers successively poured underwater concrete sealing for the No. 1 and No. 8 bridge piers of the Yangtze River Bridge. The speed of concrete mixing and pouring was also much faster than when building the Han River Railway Bridge and the Han River Highway Bridge. (Xinhua News Agency)

    武汉长江大桥的建设者
    掌握了最新的桥梁施工法
    武汉长江大桥的建设者掌握了世界上最新的桥梁施工方法——管柱钻孔法的复杂技术。职工们制造最初一个桥墩钢围囹的时候，曾花了两个月的时间，而最近制造大桥最后两个桥墩的钢围囹，一共只用了40天。新施工方法需要的大型管柱，比汉水铁桥、汉水公路桥所用的管桩粗好几倍。装吊工人下沉管柱的效率，比一年前他们在汉水公路桥打桩时候的效率提高了近三分之二。1月上旬，我国第一台大型震动打桩机在大桥工地使用以后，下沉管柱的速度又加快了一倍以上。
    不久以前，工人们先后在长江大桥一号和八号桥墩灌完了水下封底混凝土，混凝土的搅拌和灌注的速度，也比修建汉水铁桥和汉水公路桥的时候加快了很多。　（新华社）
