    Every Locomotive Exceeds Its Axle Load Limit
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    In the last two or three months, the Changchun Locomotive Depot has been changing almost daily. Things that were difficult to do in the past are now easy; things that were once considered impossible are now being accomplished.

    Two months ago, some people said that the Changchun Locomotive Depot had bad lines, steep slopes, and cold weather, making it impossible to handle more trains exceeding their axle load limits. Now, under the same conditions, every locomotive is able to exceed its axle load limit. Some are pulling six or seven hundred tons of goods more than the traction quota, while others are pulling two or three hundred tons more.

    A month ago, some people worried that this year's traction quota had been raised too much. Last year's traction quota was 2,250 tons, and this year it is 2,450 tons. It would not be easy to reach 2,450 tons; if more goods were pulled on top of that level, it would be completely impossible. However, as of February 7th, drivers who can pull more than 2,700 tons of goods account for more than 80% of the total number of drivers in the depot. Some even pulled 3,000 tons.

    This rapid change proves that the potential of railway transportation is surprisingly great. In the five years from 1951 to 1955, the traction quota of the Changchun Locomotive Depot increased by 300 tons. However, this year it has increased by 450 tons. That is, the increase in a couple of months is 150 tons more than the total increase in the past 5 years. In the past, some people used various reasons to explain that China's railway transportation capacity could not be improved quickly. Now, the Changchun Locomotive Depot, a relatively difficult place that has never been able to exceed its axle load limit by much, can also exceed it significantly. Why can't those less difficult places exceed it even more?

    The process of discovering this huge potential is a process of struggling against right-leaning conservative thinking.

    As early as last winter, Li Shaoqiang, a driver in the Changchun Locomotive Depot, was not satisfied with the status quo and broke the quota, pulling 550 tons more than the traction quota. Ma Yunsheng, the deputy director of the Changchun Locomotive Depot, did not like this innovation, saying that it "disrupted the axle load exceeding ability table." In his opinion, the "axle load exceeding ability table" was an advanced standard jointly formulated by advanced drivers; if this "standard" was disrupted again, there would be problems. However, he did not understand that since people can create an advanced quota, they can also overturn this quota under new circumstances. Why did Ma Yunsheng advocate that the "axle load exceeding ability table" was immutable? Because he was afraid that this change would make it impossible for him to do leadership work comfortably. As a leader of an enterprise, he should walk in front of the masses, absorb strength from the masses to improve the backward state of leadership, and should not be afraid of reform and prevent the masses from advancing because the leadership work cannot keep up.

    The Party organization and the trade union of the Changchun Locomotive Depot criticized Ma Yunsheng's conservative thinking and supported Li Shaoqiang's innovation. In December of last year, the four chartered train groups led by Li Shaoqiang, Cao Junjie, Xu Baosen, and Sheng Liande, with the help of the Party organization and the trade union, tapped potential, decided to complete the Five-Year Plan 7-10 months ahead of schedule, and save the country more than 320,000 yuan. After Li Shaoqiang and others put forward this plan, it immediately received a response from railway workers across the country and workers throughout Jilin Province. The Changchun Locomotive Depot also quickly launched a movement to exceed the axle load limit. Every driver automatically requested to pull more goods. A famous locomotive that used to pull little also pulled 3,000 tons. Many model locomotives have also repeatedly broken the original targets and repeatedly revised their plans. Li Shaoqiang originally planned to haul 21 million ton-kilometers per month, but now he hauls an average of more than 26 million ton-kilometers per month. With the development of the axle load exceeding movement, the car, engineering, and telecommunications departments have also launched labor competitions to ensure more axle load exceeding.

    In the face of this seething new axle load exceeding movement, some people came out shouting and screaming again, demanding to stop exceeding the axle load limit. These people dared not openly oppose exceeding the axle load limit, but looked for beautiful excuses to stop it.

    One excuse is that "if everyone exceeds the axle load limit, there will be accidents." In fact, many of the locomotives with the most axle load exceeding in the Changchun Locomotive Depot have never had accidents. The chartered train group led by Li Shaoqiang often exceeds the axle load limit, and has traveled more than 380,000 kilometers from 1953 to the present without an accident. Why do some locomotives have accidents when exceeding the axle load limit? Taking the Changchun Locomotive Depot as an example, 13 accidents occurred in January this year. The occurrence of these accidents was not because of excessive axle load exceeding, but because of poor locomotive quality and poor methods of operating locomotives and burning boilers by drivers and stokers. Some people will say that, in any case, exceeding the axle load limit will damage the locomotive. In fact, drivers who know how to exceed the axle load limit not only do not damage the locomotive, but also improve the quality of the locomotive. The question is how to improve locomotive quality through advanced methods of exceeding the axle load limit. Drivers Li Shaoqiang and Cao Junjie both said: "If you want to exceed the axle load limit, the first thing is to improve the quality of the locomotive and maintain the locomotive well." In order to exceed the axle load limit more, they also learned the technology of fitters, constantly checking the locomotive and carefully maintaining it. Because the locomotives hauled by Li Shaoqiang and others are well maintained, they are also prepared to postpone the overhaul time by one year.

    Some people also say: "We support the locomotive department in exceeding the axle load limit, but our department's conditions are not good and cannot fully guarantee the axle load exceeding work." This is also wrong. The axle load exceeding work must rely on the strong guarantee of other departments. If the station does not actively organize trains exceeding the axle load limit, it will be difficult for the locomotive department to exceed the axle load limit; if the engineering department does not maintain the line well, the axle load exceeding work will also encounter difficulties. High-quality axle load exceeding should be a common undertaking of all departments of the railway. Exceeding the axle load limit can drive other departments to advance together and improve the entire railway work. If the conditions in other departments are indeed not good, they should seize the positive factor of exceeding the axle load limit to overcome backward factors and create conditions. It is never possible to not work hard to guarantee the exceeding of the axle load limit because of poor conditions. The reason why the Changchun Locomotive Depot can exceed the axle load limit so well is because other departments promote the spirit of mutual cooperation and work hard to improve their work to ensure more exceeding of the axle load limit. Other departments have also eliminated backward phenomena in their work because they guarantee the exceeding of the axle load limit. This fact shows that we must oppose departmentalism and oppose the local view that regards exceeding the axle load limit as only the business of the locomotive department. The station, which specifically controls transportation organization work, has a great responsibility for the quality of exceeding the axle load limit. In the past, the main reason why the axle load limit could not be exceeded well was that the technical operation level of the station was low. Because the technical operations of the station were not good, on the one hand, the axle load limit was exceeded, and on the other hand, it was under-loaded; on the one hand, more vehicles were pulled, and on the other hand, more single locomotives were run. Various hub stations should strive to improve technical operations in the exceeding of the axle load limit to ensure high-quality exceeding of the axle load limit.

    台台机车都超轴
    本报记者　陈迹
    最近两三个月，长春机务段差不多一天一个变化。过去不好办的事，现在好办了；过去认为不可能办到的事，现在能办到了。
    两个月以前，有人曾经说：长春机务段的线路不好，坡度大，天气冷，不能多搞超轴的列车。现在在同样的条件下，台台机车都能够超轴了。有的比牵引定数多拉了六、七百吨货物，有的多拉了二、三百吨货物。
    一个月以前，有人耽忧今年牵引定数提高得很多。去年牵引定数是2，250吨，今年是2，450吨。要想达到2，450吨，就不容易；如果在这个水平上，再多拉货物，那根本不可能。可是，到2月7日止，能拉2，700吨以上货物的司机已经占全段司机总数80％以上。有的甚至拉了3，000吨。
    这种飞快的变化，证明铁路运输潜力是大得惊人的。从1951—1955年的五年内，长春机务段的牵引定数增加了300吨。但是，今年以来增加了450吨。即个把月的时间增加的数字比过去5年时间增加的总数还要多150吨。过去有些人用种种理由说明我国铁路运输能力是不能很快提高的。现在长春机务段这个一向不能多超轴的比较困难的地方，也能够多超轴，那些比较不困难的地方又为什么不能更多地超轴呢？
    这种巨大的潜在能力的发现过程，是反对右倾保守思想的斗争过程。
    早在去年冬天，长春机务段司机长李绍强就不满足于现状，打破了定额，比牵引定数多拉了550吨。长春机务段副段长马云升不喜欢这种创举，说是“破坏了超轴能力表”。在他看来，“超轴能力表”是先进司机们共同制定的先进标准；如果再破坏了这个“标准”，就会出乱子。但是，他不了解，既然人们能创造一种先进定额，人们也能在新的情况下推翻这种定额。为什么马云升主张“超轴能力表”是一成不变的呢？因为他害怕这一变，就使他不能安逸地做领导工作。作为企业的领导人，应该走在群众前面，从群众中吸取力量，来改进领导的落后状态，不应该因为领导工作赶不上，而害怕改革，阻止群众前进。
    长春机务段党组织和工会批判了马云升这种保守思想，支持了李绍强的创举。去年12月，李绍强和曹俊杰、徐宝森、盛连德等领导的四个包车组，又在党组织和工会的帮助下，挖掘潜在能力，决定提前7—10个月完成五年计划，并且为国家节省资金32万多元。李绍强等提出这个计划后，立即得到全国铁路职工和吉林全省职工的响应。长春机务段也很快地掀起了超轴的运动。每个司机都自动要求多拉货物。一台有名的拉得少的机车，也拉了3，000吨。许多模范的机车，也一再突破原定指标，一再修改计划。李绍强原来计划每个月牵引2，100万吨公里，现在每月平均牵引2，600多万吨公里。随着超轴运动的开展，车务、工务和电务等部门，为了保证多超轴，也都发起了劳动竞赛。
    在这个如火如荼的新的超轴运动面前，又有些人出来大喊大叫，要停止超轴。这些人不敢公开反对超轴，却寻找漂亮的借口来阻止超轴。
    一种借口是“大家都超轴，就要出事故”。事实上长春机务段许多超轴最多的机车，都是从来不发生事故的。李绍强领导的包车组经常超轴，从1953年到现在走行了38万多公里，没有发生事故。为什么有些机车在超轴中发生事故呢？拿长春机务段来说，今年1月发生13件事故。这些事故的发生，不是因为超轴过多，而是因为机车质量不好，司机、司炉操纵机车和焚烧锅炉的方法不善。有人会说，不管怎样，超轴会损坏机车。其实，会超轴的司机不但不损坏机车，而且能提高机车的质量。问题是如何通过超轴的先进方法，来提高机车质量。司机李绍强和曹俊杰都说：“要想超轴，头一件事就是要提高机车质量，把机车保养好。”他们为了多超轴，还学会了钳工的技术，时刻检查机车，细心保养机车。李绍强等牵引的机车因为保养得好，还准备把大修时间推后一年。
    还有些人说：“我们拥护机务部门超轴，但是我们这个部门条件不好，不能完全保证超轴工作。”这也是不对的。超轴工作一定要依靠其他部门有力的保证，如果车站不积极组织超轴的列车，机务部门就不好超轴；如果工务部门不很好保养线路，超轴工作也要遇到困难。质量良好的超轴，应该是铁路各个部门共同的事业。超轴可以带动别的部门共同前进，把整个铁路工作提高一步。如果别的部门条件确实不好，就应该抓住超轴这个积极因素，来克服落后的因素，创造条件。决不能因为条件差而不努力保证超轴。长春机务段所以能很好地超轴，就是因为别的部门发扬互相协作的精神，努力改进工作，保证多超轴。别的部门也因为保证超轴而消除工作中落后的现象。这个事实说明必须反对本位主义，反对把超轴看成只是机务部门的事的局部观点。具体掌握运输组织工作的车站，对于超轴的质量，有极大责任。过去不能很好超轴，一个重要原因就是车站技术作业水平低。因为车站技术作业不善，所以一方面超轴，另方面欠轴；一方面多拉了车辆，另方面又多跑了单机。各个枢纽车站应该在超轴中努力改善技术作业，保证质量良好的超轴。
