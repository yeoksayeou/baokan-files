    Lhasa River Embankment Project Begins Construction

    The Lhasa River embankment project in the southern suburbs of Lhasa City commenced construction on February 1st. On that day, more than 300 Tibetan and Han workers entered the construction site to excavate the embankment foundation and built part of the motor vehicle access road for transporting stone.
    The Lhasa River embankment project is being built according to the decision of the State Council. The main part of this project is to renovate and newly build a stone embankment, more than 3 meters high, 2.5 meters wide at the top, and 13 li long on the Lhasa River bank south of the urban area. The entire project will be carried out in two phases, and is expected to be completed before the flood season this year and in November, respectively. After this stone embankment is completed, it can guarantee that Lhasa City will not suffer from floods.

    拉萨河堤防工程动工
    拉萨市南郊的拉萨河堤防工程2月1日动工。当天有300多名藏族和汉族工人进入工地挖堤基，并且修好了部分供运送石料用的汽车便道。
    拉萨河堤防工程是根据国务院的决定修筑的。这个工程的主要部分是在市区以南的拉萨河岸上整修、新修一条高3公尺以上、顶宽2.5公尺、长达13里的石堤。全部工程分两期进行，预计在今年汛期以前和11月间分别完工。这条石堤修好后，可以保证拉萨市不遭受水灾。
