Molotov's Speech at the 20th Congress of the CPSU
Comrades!
    In his summary report of the Central Committee, Comrade N.S. Khrushchev presented a vivid and grand picture of some of the events in which we have actively participated since the 19th Congress. This report summarizes the experience of our Party's struggle in the current period, provides a profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the current international situation, and puts forward new and important tasks facing our Party and the Soviet people.
    Our people have traveled a glorious road. As early as the pre-war period, our people had basically built a socialist society, and at present, are gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. There have been many difficulties along this road, and overcoming these difficulties required extraordinary concentration of effort, and sometimes even huge sacrifices, especially during the war.
    We know that we still have major unresolved tasks. However, our country is moving forward with firm steps, victoriously solving one increasingly complex task after another on the road to the victory of communism under the leadership of its Communist Party.
    The Soviet people victoriously completed the Fifth Five-Year Plan, greatly overfulfilling the important tasks in the plan regarding the high tide of the national economy. Now, the new great tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan have been put forward, and we all believe that these tasks will be victoriously solved.
    The foundation of the strength and vitality of our great country is the worker-peasant alliance established by our Leninist Party. (Applause) The growing and unbreakable alliance of the working class and collective farmers is today the foundation of the spiritual and political solidarity of our socialist society, and the foundation of the fraternal friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union.
    Since the 19th Congress, our Party has done much work to further consolidate the alliance of the working class and collective farmers. The issue of raising agriculture has justifiably become the focus of the Party's attention. This is out of special necessity, because agriculture is clearly lagging behind the overall development of the national economy, lagging behind the rapid rise of industry.
    In order to ensure the most rapid satisfaction of the growing needs of residents for food and the growing needs of the food industry and light industry for agricultural raw materials, the Party and the Soviet government have adopted a series of major new measures. Among them, first and foremost: strengthening the material incentives obtained by collective farms and collective farmers, machine tractor stations and state farms in increasing the production of agricultural products, appropriately adjusting product prices, launching work to strengthen agricultural mechanization and increase mineral fertilizer production, taking measures to strengthen collective farms, machine tractor stations and state farms in organization, especially sending skilled personnel to collective farms to take on leadership work, sending agronomists and mechanics, etc., and further strengthening the Party organizations in the countryside. The victorious implementation of the bold plan to reclaim virgin and fallow land is of particularly great significance. This has increased the sown area, mainly grain sown area, by 33 million hectares. The issue of vigorously increasing the corn sown area has been raised from a new perspective, which is of particularly great significance for the rapid rise of animal husbandry. These measures and a series of other measures have opened up new prospects for the rise of agriculture in our country, and have been unanimously supported by collective farmers.
    It must be pointed out that the Party and the Soviet government pay special attention to improving the welfare of collective farmers. In accordance with the task of building communism, the national plan stipulates that the living standards of the countryside should be closer to the living standards of the cities. As everyone knows, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the actual income of collective farmers increased by 50%, while the actual wages of employees increased by 39%. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates a further increase in the income of collective farmers - an average of at least 40%, while the actual wages of employees will increase by an average of about 30%. This policy direction of the Party is in line with the interests of further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and will guarantee the further consolidation of our country.
    Our Party has always been concerned with the comprehensive development and improvement of industry and transportation. At the same time, the Party has persistently emphasized the priority significance of developing heavy industry, because the development of agriculture and other sectors of the national economy, the consolidation of the national defense strength of our socialist motherland, and the further improvement of the people's welfare all depend on heavy industry.
    In the past period, the Party has particularly concentrated its efforts on improving the technical level of industry. At the same time, it has been found that we still have many untapped potentials in increasing labor productivity and increasing the production of industrial products. To this end, we must first make our industry produce the necessary quantity of truly modern and most advanced equipment, so that the old equipment of various enterprises can be replaced with new equipment in a timely manner. All of this is also associated with making every effort to improve the organization of production. At the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and at many meetings with the participation of leaders of various enterprises and with the broader participation of scientific and technical forces, many shortcomings in this regard have been exposed, and methods for obtaining new and more significant achievements in industry have been formulated. The work done under the leadership of the Central Committee must be able to advance the cause of developing industry and construction in many ways.
    It is also necessary to ensure the proper rhythm in the work of enterprises, otherwise it will not be possible to eliminate many economic losses, and it will not be possible to further strengthen the planning principle in industry accordingly.
    As everyone knows from Comrade Khrushchev's report, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, our industrial departments and agencies will transition to a 7-hour work system. In this regard, as well as in further greatly increasing the actual wages of employees and many other measures, the Party's consistent special concern for improving the lives of the working people is demonstrated.
    The Party openly and boldly exposes major shortcomings in various departments of economic and cultural construction. At the same time, the Party is also striving to improve and streamline state organs and ensure the strictest compliance with the legal system. In all these aspects, the Party relies on the support and active assistance of workers, collective farmers and intellectuals.
        I. Fundamental Changes in the International Situation
          and the Possibility of Preventing a New War
    World War II was the most severe test of the socialist social system and state system of the Soviet Union. And this test showed that a socialist country, relying on the full support of the people, possesses an inexhaustible source of spiritual and material strength.
    Although the Soviet Union was one of the countries that bore the main burden of the war in World War II, our country returned to the road of rapid rise in national economic and cultural construction in the short period after the war. As everyone knows, the people's democratic countries that are building socialism are also victoriously solving their own tasks.
    The relations between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other socialist countries are developing day by day on the basis of consolidated friendship and consistent basic goals. The long-tested leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties guarantees the continuous advancement of the socialist countries. In all the events of recent times, one cannot fail to point out the achievements of socialist construction in China, these great achievements obtained by the Chinese people make them worthy of the great Chinese people (long and continuous applause). All of this has made it possible to form a powerful camp of peaceful, democratic and socialist countries.
      The formation of this camp has very important international significance. The experience of the countries that make up this camp demonstrates various different paths in building socialism, unprecedentedly expands the possibility and scope of socialist influence. At the same time, this camp is a reliable pillar for the working class and all working people in capitalist countries in their struggle to win their rights and improve their lives. The people of colonies and dependent countries understand that the strength and further consolidation of this camp is of great significance for winning and consolidating their freedom and national independence. (Applause)
    Now, coexisting with the world capitalist system is the world socialist system. History has put the issue of peaceful coexistence of these two systems on the agenda. Of course, it must be estimated that differences of opinion and disputes between these two systems are inevitable. Therefore, the following question must be clearly answered: how should the various disputes that already exist and are occurring in the course of events be resolved?
    There are only two ways to resolve disputes: one way is negotiation and peaceful mediation of differences of opinion; the other way is war. There is no other way. The Soviet Union and all other socialist countries resolutely oppose the path of war. We will do our best to make the supporters of the two opposing systems recognize the principle of peaceful coexistence of the two systems, and we will do our best to resolve mature and occurring international issues through negotiations, in order to safeguard and consolidate the peace and security of the people of all countries. (Long and continuous applause)
    Therefore, it must be particularly emphasized that Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's report timely raised a series of principled questions regarding the current international development, especially the question of the possibility of preventing war in the current era. Millions upon millions of people have personally experienced the two world wars and deeply know the bloody results, countless disasters and sacrifices caused by war. In these two wars, the number of deaths and injuries was over 80 million. Under modern conditions, a new world war will bring even greater and incalculable destruction and danger. There is only one conclusion: for the benefit of all mankind, we must do everything in our power, not let go of any opportunity to defend peace, expose conspiracies against peace, and unite the people of all countries to oppose the aggressive forces of imperialism, to safeguard peace, friendship and friendly cooperation between the people of all countries. (Applause)
    We all remember Lenin's famous point: as long as imperialism exists, war is inevitable. Under the conditions of imperialism's dominance, countries have no way to resolve their contradictions except by force and finally by war.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that, on the one hand, under imperialism, there exists an economic basis for generating war, and on the other hand, imperialism itself also generates social forces that demand the elimination of imperialist war and imperialism itself. Under certain conditions, this social force will become a force sufficient to prevent war and eliminate imperialist war. Therefore, the view that war is destined to be inevitable is incorrect.
    Of course, under current conditions, since imperialism exists, the danger of a new world war still exists, not to mention other military conflicts.
    However, in the past, there was a danger of war but no ability to prevent it, at least there was no truly great force to prevent it. And now this force - and it is not a small force - has become a reality, and its emergence has created a real possibility of preventing war. (Applause)
    Of course, it cannot be ignored that some of the most aggressive imperialist groups are painstakingly devising various plans in an attempt to reverse the course of history. The "deterrence" plan that everyone knows, especially the "liberation plan" which is full of the smell of aggression against socialist countries, is a concrete manifestation of this attempt. However, formulating such a plan - a plan that delusionally uses violence to restore capitalism in socialist countries - is one thing, and whether such a plan can be realized under current conditions is quite another, because the entire history of the existence and development of the Soviet Union has brilliantly proved that such a plan is impossible to realize. (Long and continuous applause)
    Everyone can see very clearly how profound the changes in the international situation have been since the First World War, especially since the Second World War. Now every rational person can see that the contrast between class forces and political forces has changed, the position of imperialism has been greatly weakened, and the position of socialism has been greatly strengthened; at the same time, many other anti-war forces have also been greatly strengthened. All of this enables us to draw the conclusion that the situation on the question of whether war will occur is now completely different from the situation before the Second World War, and even more different from the situation before the Great War of 1914-1918.
    At that time, that is, before the First World War, the various socialist parties of the working class had put forward the task of stopping the war. Early at that time, the slogan "use war to stop war" had already taken root in the hearts of the people, and it grasped the broad strata of the working class in many countries. However, at the decisive juncture when the First World War of imperialism occurred, the international proletariat was still politically weak and divided by the betrayal of the leaders of the parties of the Second International. Only our Bolshevik, Leninist Party thoroughly adhered to the position of resolutely opposing imperialism and imperialist war, and only individual socialists in other countries maintained loyalty to proletarian internationalism. Everyone also knows that this position of our Party played an extremely important role not only in the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, but also in accelerating the end of the First World War.
    In the period before the Second World War, the Soviet Union persistently defended peace and called on other countries to unite against launching a new world war. Although it was already obvious that German fascists and their aggressive allies were preparing for the Second World War, other countries did not accept the Soviet Union's proposal to stop the war. They even attempted to guide the aggressive forces of German fascists to oppose the Soviet Union. Everyone knows that they formulated the plan of "killing with a borrowed knife".
    At that time, the Soviet Union was the only socialist country, and it and other peace-loving people in various countries who sympathized with it did not have enough strength to crush the war plans of the most reactionary imperialist countries. Under these circumstances, the Second World War began.
    The result of this war proved that Lenin was completely correct. As early as the middle of 1915, he wrote:
    "The experience of war, like the experience of all crises in history and the experience of all great disasters and all changes in human life, brutalizes and impairs some people, but at the same time it enlightens and tempers others, and generally speaking, in the history of the world, the number and strength of the latter will be greater than the former, except for the individual cases of the decline and demise of a certain country." (Complete Works of Lenin, Vol. 21, pp. 191-192)
    Compared with the First World War, the Second World War enlightened and tempered millions of people to a greater extent.
    In the course of the Second World War and after the end of the Second World War, in many countries, new social forces and political forces were produced, invigorated, and united. The appearance of these forces on the historical stage fundamentally changed the world political situation, greatly encouraged the strength of the people of various countries, and at the same time, the war also brought about tremendous changes in political life, especially in some countries in Europe and Asia.
    Now there are two camps of world countries with fundamentally different social systems and state systems. In addition to the world imperialist camp, the world socialist camp has been established, which includes more than 900 million people in Europe and Asia, that is, more than one-third of the world's population. If in the imperialist countries camp, those classes and groups that strive to maintain their dominant position and privileged position or even strive to launch a new war still play a decisive role, then in the socialist camp countries, the situation is completely different.
    Now, while the most aggressive groups of certain imperialist countries are engaged in preparing for a new war, the socialist camp countries are taking the maintenance of peace and the consolidation of peace, and the struggle for peace, friendship and cooperation between the people of all countries as their main tasks. Therefore, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries are not only representatives of the most profound and vital interests of the people of their own countries, but also of all other countries (here refers to the real masses of the people).
    On the issue of peace, the interests of the people of all countries (regardless of the social system and state system of these countries) are consistent with the interests of the socialist camp countries, because the socialist camp persistently maintains universal peace, friendship and cooperation between the people of all countries.
    We should not underestimate the danger of war, and we should not be intoxicated by the illusion that it seems that we can obtain peace and live a peaceful life under any conditions. We should always be vigilant and vigilantly watch the aggressive plans of the imperialists. We should not rest easy, thinking that it seems that we can persuade the imperialists with good words and peace-loving plans. All of this is only meaningful under the following conditions: we also implement correct domestic and foreign policies at the same time; the working people in each socialist country are more and more closely united into a friendly big family; the fraternal alliance of friendship and mutual assistance between the people of these countries is consolidated; the people of other countries will increasingly sympathize with our policy of peace and international cooperation; we will be more concerned about the growth of people's welfare and all those necessary conditions that conform to ensuring the true security of all socialist countries. (Applause)
    We should not underestimate our strength and many potentials in the cause of maintaining and safeguarding peace. Underestimating in this regard will prevent us from using all those forces that have emerged and are constantly growing everywhere in the world after the Second World War to maintain and consolidate peace. On the other hand, we have a proper understanding of the new situation after the war, and we have a recognition of the vigorous development of the material and spiritual strength of the people of all countries who strive to prevent new wars and maintain the cause of peace, we will assume great responsibilities, that is, to earnestly prepare and organize these forces, consolidate and develop these forces, for the benefit of peace, friendship and cooperation between the people of all countries, and for the benefit of preventing new wars.
    Now, even those in the camp that is hostile to socialism clearly know that we possess great material strength and high technological achievements, including the most powerful and various types of the latest weapons, which we can use to implement necessary self-defense if necessary. (Stormy and continuous applause) It should be thought that in this regard, our enemies have now abandoned many illusions that they still had not long ago. We must strive to make ourselves more powerful, more organized and stronger in terms of material and technical strength, and possess all the most complete means necessary to ensure security and repel aggression. (Long and continuous applause) Our potential in this regard is no less than that of the other camp. Our material resources, the latest technological achievements, the large number of manpower, the consolidated friendship of our various ethnic groups, and their spiritual and political unity make us firmly believe that the socialist camp is invincible. (Stormy and continuous applause)
    Now the facts are so obvious that they will definitely affect the groups that have hopes for their war plans to dominate the world, because these plans have lost any practical significance under modern international conditions, and are first of all very dangerous for those who attempt to launch a new world war. In addition, there are many people in the industrial and commercial circles of capitalist countries who oppose political adventurism and reckless behavior. They would rather develop practical economic ties between countries, regardless of the differences in the social systems of these countries; and the development of economic ties has very broad possibilities.
    At the same time, do not forget that in historical tests, the decisive role is played by the people, their unity and their belief in their just cause. In the heroic years of the civil war, in the great patriotic war, at the moment when the question of the life and death of the Soviet state was decided, in those years when our people not only defended their socialist motherland, but also guaranteed the greatest achievements that promoted the further development of socialist forces, our people particularly convincingly proved this point.
    Now we have every reason to say that the spiritual and political unity of the people of all countries in the entire socialist camp is constantly strengthening. The people of various socialist countries have united, and their friendship is strengthening and consolidating. This is a close and comprehensive brotherly cooperation between various independent and autonomous countries. This situation greatly strengthens the strength and potential of these countries. Aggressors must take all of the above circumstances into consideration, even if they dare to attack a certain socialist country. (Applause)
    On the issue of defending peace, an international environment has now formed that we could only regard as an ideal 10 or 15 years ago.
    The problem is not only that the period when the Soviet Union was the only socialist country surrounded by hostile capitalism has become a thing of the past, but also that a strong fortress of peace - the socialist camp composed of European and Asian countries - has now formed. On the issue of defending peace, our allies are also increasing more and more outside this camp.
    Under the current conditions, not only the people of all countries united under the banner of socialism are defending peace, but also the people of many other countries, especially those who were completely subordinate to imperialism yesterday and are now embarking on the road of independent national life, are currently openly expressing their opposition to aggressive plans. The people and governments of these countries understand that the policy of preparing for war and establishing military blocs that the aggressive groups are pursuing is a danger to the independence they have already won.
    Therefore, it is necessary to talk about the world-historical significance of the current disintegration of the colonial system. The establishment of independent countries in Asia and Africa has promoted the consolidation of peace and international cooperation. It should be mentioned that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which were announced by India and the People's Republic of China for the cause of safeguarding the freedom, independence and peaceful coexistence of the people of all countries, later received a positive and huge response around the world. Here, it is necessary to mention the Bandung Conference attended by 29 Asian and African countries. This conference showed how the role of the people of Asian and African countries who have been freed from - although not completely freed from everywhere - the oppression of colonialism has increased in international affairs.
    The developing anti-colonial movement includes the broadest masses in Asia, and is also beginning to unfold increasingly in Africa. These masses strive to improve their situation, and they are making every effort to use the various favorable conditions that have just arisen for this purpose. They are not only not interested in new wars, but are also fully opposing imperialism and imperialist wars.
    As everyone knows, in capitalist countries, the masses of the people have also launched a broad anti-war movement, that is, the movement to defend peace. Participating in this movement are not only all conscious workers, a large part of the peasants and intellectuals, but also more and more people from bourgeois origins. There are many other people who, although they have not participated in the movement to defend peace, have realized the extreme danger of a new world war; their voices are also converging with the movement to defend peace.
    Aggressors have never encountered such great difficulties in realizing their plans as before, because they can no longer expect all ethnic groups to willingly and submissively accept their policies when they implement their policies. But we cannot be complacent and let things take their course because of this.
    We know how many and how complicated the means used by the imperialists are in order to continue the arms race, incite war mania, and use this atmosphere to formulate new aggressive war plans. We know how widely they have used the bourgeois press, radio, film and all other propaganda tools to achieve these goals. We should not underestimate all of this, so that the resistance and counterattack of the people of all countries against any new plans to prepare for war will not be weakened, but greatly strengthened. We should do more work than before, so that the social progressive forces and the enthusiasm and unity of the broad masses in all countries will continue to grow, in order to achieve the goal of stopping the war.
    We can never conclude that we seem to have done everything necessary to make a new war impossible. We are often still held captive by those habits and conventions that were formed in the past, before the Second World War. These habits and conventions are now hindering us from using new, broader and more active forms of struggle against war. We often still underestimate the new possibilities that have emerged in the post-war period. This shortcoming is also reflected in the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Central Committee of our Party has timely pointed this out. We should eliminate this situation, and eliminate the underestimation of those huge possibilities we have in the cause of safeguarding the peace and security of the people of all countries. The basis of this huge possibility is the formation of the world socialist camp and the constant growth of its strength, the unprecedented high tide of the liberation struggle of the people of colonies and dependent countries, the militant workers' movement and the internationalist unity of the working class in various capitalist countries, the widely unfolded democratic movement to defend peace, the activities of women and youth democratic organizations, and various other mass struggle forms to defend peace and oppose war. (Applause)
    The starting point of our Party in formulating its foreign policy is that we must seriously consider the specific conditions, and we must understand the current situation and the prospects of historical development. The combination of principle and flexibility in implementing the foreign policy direction in the Leninist way is the guarantee of our Party's success in solving international problems.
    Our desire to defend peace and prevent a new world war relies on the invincibility of the cooperation of socialist countries, and relies on the increasing support of such non-socialist countries that oppose military blocs that conflict with the interests of peace, and support the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and state systems. Everyone clearly knows how great a role the positions of countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, Egypt, etc. play in consolidating peace.
    In our struggle to crush the plans of war instigators, we should consider the following situations in accordance with Leninist principles, that is, there are economic contradictions and political contradictions between the member states of various aggressive groups that exist and grow. These contradictions are inevitable, because the strongest member states in such groups strive to strengthen their imperialist position at the expense of their partners. These contradictions weaken the aggressive forces, and at the same time increase the possibility of defending peace.
    The interests of peace and the interests of opposing the danger of a new war require that the issue of establishing unity in the working class should become the focus of attention of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. The division in the ranks of the working class has been used by the aggressive forces twice to prepare for and launch a world war, and the working class cannot but learn a lesson from this fact. This division can never be explained by the reason that the Communists and Socialists have different opinions on the ways and methods of striving for socialism and on the extremely important issue of freeing the people of all countries from the threat of a new war. If the working class guarantees the unity of its ranks, the unity of the international proletariat will become an insurmountable obstacle to the war forces. If the working class unites its strength in action and thoroughly demonstrates its determination to defend peace, war will not occur. (Stormy and continuous applause)
      II. The Soviet Union's Struggle for Peace and International Security
    Comrade Khrushchev's report has made a detailed analysis of the international situation, so there is no need to discuss here the facts and measures that reflect the Soviet government's peace initiatives in the past period. It is only necessary to emphasize the major international significance of several events last year and our general diplomatic policy of easing international tensions.
    Here refers to the restoration of friendly relations with the fraternal Yugoslav people. These relations are now developing more and more smoothly, which is not only beneficial to our two countries, but also beneficial to strengthening peace and international security. If the abnormal relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia had continued for several years, it would only have been beneficial to those who are hostile to peace.
    Here also refers to the conclusion of the treaty on Austria, agreeing to Austria's policy of permanent neutrality. The countries that so resolutely establish one new military aggressive group after another in Europe and other parts of the world should also agree to this; while the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are further developing, the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany also helps to consolidate the cause of European peace. The Soviet Union's proposal on establishing a European collective security system has received a wide response. The Soviet government fully supports the People's Republic of China's proposal on Asian collective security. The Soviet Union continues to consistently struggle for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.
    The Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference in July last year occupies a special position. It clearly showed the real possibility of easing international tensions and improving relations between the Soviet Union and the major countries in the other camp. But the further development of events showed that there are still many obstacles on the road to improving relations with these countries. These obstacles are caused by the supporters of the short-sighted "position of strength" policy. However, treating the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with this policy will inevitably fail.
    It is well known to everyone that the plotters of a series of aggressive groups in Europe, the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and a series of other events, are mainly certain Americans. It is also well known to everyone that a military group led by the United States and the United Kingdom, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, plays a special role in this regard. It is precisely because certain people in the United States have intensified their pressure that the governments of a series of countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other aggressive groups are rushing to expand their armaments and expand their military budgets, tightening the screws of the tax squeeze, deliberately inciting war hysteria among residents, and spreading slanderous remarks to the whole world about the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries having aggressive intentions.
    After the collapse of Hitler's rule and the establishment of the peace-loving German Democratic Republic, there is now no such aggressive country on the European continent that, under the current circumstances, would dare to launch a new world war and violate the Soviet Union or the people's democratic countries. In the pre-war years, Hitler's Germany was launching the Second World War step by step. Now it is different in Europe from what it was then. However, we cannot fail to notice the plan to re-militarize West Germany, which has been pulled into some aggressive military groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Military Alliance. There is no doubt that the re-militarization of West Germany will deepen contradictions and increase the possibility of conflict, including contradictions and conflicts between the imperialist countries themselves.
    In the East, a new era has also begun. After the defeat of militarist Japan and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, there is now no aggressive country in Asia that dares to launch a third world war. Because the People's Republic of China has fully proved that it can defend its national interests, and it unswervingly implements a policy of peace. Now, if we leave out South Korea, then in Asia, mainly because the island of Taiwan has become a military base of the United States, there is still a danger of aggression. It is not necessary to establish such a military base if there is no plan to invade great China.
    Facts have proved that there are still many obstacles on the road to further easing international tensions. But, despite the fact that there are obstacles on this road and they are constantly being created, the Soviet Union expressed in the past and expresses now the same firm determination to further improve its relations with other countries.
    We believe that all countries, especially the great powers - despite the fact that there are still differences of opinion between them - should unite for the common interests of maintaining peace.
    Everyone knows that in ensuring universal peace, it largely depends on the fundamental improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. We believe that this is what the Soviet people and also the American people, as well as the people of other countries, are concerned about. Therefore, in the letter from N.A. Bulganin to U.S. President D. Eisenhower, which everyone knows, the Soviet government proposed to conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. The attitude of the U.S. government toward the Soviet proposal shows that there are now very powerful groups in the United States that advocate solving outstanding issues by war rather than negotiation, and they have a certain influence on the president and the government. But it must be known that the interests of the American people and the interests of other countries require more concern for peace. Under these circumstances, it is conceivable that our efforts to improve Soviet-U.S. relations will be properly understood in the United States.
    The Soviet government proposed to the United States to conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation, thereby once again demonstrating the sincere desire to have friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States for the benefit of peace and universal security. This is in line with the spirit and purpose of the United Nations and the desire to expand cooperation between countries.
    Our desire to strive to improve relations with the United Kingdom remains unchanged. The visit to the United Kingdom to be conducted by the leaders of our country provides new opportunities to achieve better mutual understanding and make joint efforts in further easing international tensions.
    The Soviet Union also hopes to establish friendly relations with France, and the current French government has expressed a certain desire to improve Franco-Soviet relations. Since the French government has expressed particular interest in the issue of disarmament, we will try to seek common progress with France in solving this problem. It should be considered that the strengthening of the position of democratic forces in the recent parliamentary elections will help to achieve this goal.
    Our country, both in the past and now, advocates developing friendly relations with all countries, large and small. It particularly hopes that it can also establish such relations with Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and Japan. It would not be inconsistent with their own vital interests for these countries to establish good relations with the Soviet Union.
    In order to expand the front of the struggle for peace as much as possible, our Party and the Soviet government have unfolded this struggle under the banner of easing international tensions. This policy of easing international tensions is a special manifestation of the struggle for peace under the current conditions. The policy of easing international tensions is the most popular and most flexible means of the struggle for peace, and under the current conditions provides the broadest possibilities to attract broad social strata with various different political views into this cause. This policy expands the struggle for peace beyond its usual scope, including the scope of economic and cultural interests, and is related not only to state organs and social organizations, but also to private individuals.
    Not only diplomats and politicians can promote the easing of international tensions, but also economic workers, cultural workers, state official representatives, and all others who promote the development of friendly relations and cooperation between countries in all aspects of state activities, social activities and private activities can promote the easing of international tensions. It is not accidental that aggressive groups are now taking numerous steps to hinder the development of trade relations between countries. It is certainly not accidental that certain countries set up various obstacles on the road to the development of the most ordinary scientific, technological and purely cultural ties.
    Comrades! Our Party and the Soviet government have always defended the interests of peace. The foreign policy of our country is implemented under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Party. It is precisely because of this that we are first and foremost guaranteed to achieve success in strengthening the international position of the Soviet Union and defending world peace. (Applause)
    Our major achievements in domestic life and major achievements in foreign policy are related to the fact that the Central Committee has implemented the Leninist principle of collective leadership since the 19th Congress. (Applause) The Central Committee, supported by the entire Party, resolutely opposed the personality cult that is incompatible with Marxism-Leninism and that had a negative impact for a certain period of time. It can be believed that this congress will fully agree with this principled direction. (Applause)
    In order to ease international tensions and strengthen the position of the Soviet state, the Party leadership showed a truly bold spirit of initiative and took a series of important steps.
    The Central Committee of our Party and its Presidium have perhaps never dealt with foreign policy issues as actively as they have in the recent period. Everyone still remembers such things: for example, the visit of the government delegation led by Comrade Khrushchev, Comrade Bulganin and Comrade Mikoyan to Yugoslavia, which made a fundamental change in Soviet-Yugoslav relations; and the visit of Comrade Bulganin and Comrade Khrushchev to India, Burma and Afghanistan. This visit achieved great success in developing friendly relations between the Soviet Union and these countries and their governments and people. It is also necessary to point out the Moscow negotiations with the Federal Republic of Germany and then with the German Democratic Republic, and the negotiations with Finland, Norway and other countries conducted last autumn. The meetings between Soviet leaders and foreign people, foreign delegations and journalists have greatly increased. All of this proves the enthusiasm shown by the state and Party leaders of the Soviet Union in foreign policy in the recent period. It is precisely because of all this that we have achieved positive results, made some easing of international tensions, and created certain possibilities for achieving further success in this regard. (Applause) The Party and the Soviet government have achieved certain successes in ensuring peace. The continuous growth of the material and spiritual strength of our people and the entire socialist camp is the foundation of these achievements.
    That is to say, every Soviet person and every citizen of the socialist camp, with his victorious labor and the achievements he has made in industrial enterprises and collective farms, has contributed to the cause of consolidating his country and consolidating the entire socialist camp in both large and small jobs, thereby also contributing to the cause of maintaining and consolidating peace and international security. (Applause) When we are constantly striving to improve labor productivity in factories, when we can guarantee new achievements in improving the yield per unit area of land and the productivity of livestock products in collective farms and state farms, we have every right to be proud of these achievements in communist construction. At the same time, these achievements are also the foundation for strengthening the strength and positions of the entire socialist camp, thereby creating decisive conditions for ensuring that the people of all countries live a peaceful and tranquil life. (Applause)
    Our achievements in economic and cultural construction encourage the people of all countries in the world. They are very satisfied with this, and

### 莫洛托夫在苏共第二十次代表大会上的发言

专栏：

    莫洛托夫在苏共第二十次代表大会上的发言同志们！
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在他作的中央委员会总结报告中，展示出在第十九次代表大会以后我们曾经积极参加的一些事件的鲜明的巨幅图景。这个报告总结了我们党在当前时期中的斗争经验，对于当前的国际局势作了马克思列宁主义的深刻分析，并且提出了摆在我们党和苏联人民面前的新的重大任务。
    我国人民走过了一条光荣的道路。早在战前时期，我国人民就基本上建成了社会主义社会，而在目前，正从社会主义逐步地向共产主义过渡。在这条道路上曾经存在过不少的困难，克服这些困难要求异乎寻常地集中精力，有时甚至要求巨大的牺牲，特别是在战争时期。
    我们知道，我们还有重大的没有解决的任务。但是，我们的国家以坚定的步伐向前迈进，在自己的共产党的领导下胜利地解决在走向共产主义胜利的道路上遇到的一个又一个日益复杂的任务。
    苏联人民胜利地完成了第五个五年计划，大大地超额完成了计划中关于国民经济高涨的重要任务。现在，第六个五年计划的新的伟大的任务提出来了，我们大家都相信，这些任务将能胜利地解决。
    我们伟大的国家的力量和活力的基础就是我们列宁党所建立的工农联盟。（掌声）工人阶级和集体农民的壮大的和牢不可破的联盟在今天是我们社会主义社会的精神上和政治上的显著团结的基础，是苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟各民族的兄弟友爱的基础。
    从第十九次代表大会以来，我们党作了许多工作，来使工人阶级和集体农民的联盟更为巩固。提高农业的问题有理由成为党的注意的中心。这是出于特别的必要，因为农业明显地落后于国民经济的整个发展，落后于工业的迅速高涨。
    为了保证最迅速地满足居民对食品的日益增长的需要以及食品工业和轻工业对农业原料的日益增长的需要，党和苏联政府采取了一系列重大的新措施。其中首先是：加强集体农庄和集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场在增加农产品生产方面所获得的物质鼓励，适当地调整产品价格，展开加强农业机械化和增加矿质肥料生产的工作，采取在组织上加强集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的措施，特别是派遣业务熟练的工作人员前往集体农庄担任领导工作，派遣农艺师和机械师等，以及进一步加强农村里的党组织。胜利地执行开垦生荒地和熟荒地的大胆计划，具有特别重大的意义。这使得播种面积、主要是谷物播种面积增加了3，300万公顷。大力增加玉蜀黍播种面积的问题，从新的角度提了出来，这对畜牧业的迅速高涨具有特别重大的意义。这些措施和其他一系列的措施为我国农业的高涨开辟了新的前景，并且得到了集体农民的一致拥护。
    必须指出，党和苏维埃政府特别重视集体农民福利的提高。根据建设共产主义的任务，在国家计划中规定农村的生活水平应更加接近城市的生活水平。大家知道，在第五个五年计划期间，集体农民的实际收入增加了50％，而职工的实际工资增加了39％。第六个五年计划规定进一步提高集体农民的收入——平均至少提高40％，而职工的实际工资平均大约提高30％。党的这种政策方针符合进一步巩固工农联盟的利益，将保证我们国家的更加巩固。
    我们党一向关心工业和运输业的全面发展和提高。同时，党坚持不懈地着重指出发展重工业的优先意义，因为农业和国民经济其他部门的发展、我们社会主义祖国国防力量的巩固、人民福利的进一步改善都取决于重工业。
    在已经过去的这段时期中，党特别集中力量提高工业的技术水平。同时，发现我们在提高劳动生产率和增加工业产品的生产方面还有许多未被利用的潜力。为此，首先必须使我们工业生产出必要数量的真正现代化的最完善的设备，以便使各企业的旧的设备能够及时地换上新的设备。所有这一切还同尽一切可能来改进生产组织有关联。在中央委员会全体会议上和有各企业领导人员参加的并且更广泛地吸引科学技术力量参加的许多会议上，曾经揭露了这方面的许多缺点，并且拟定了在工业方面获得新的、更加重大的成就的办法。在中央委员会领导下所做的工作一定可以在许多方面把发展工业和建设的事业推向前进。
    还必须保证企业工作中的应有的节奏性，否则就不能够做到消除许多经济方面的损失，就不能够相应地进一步加强工业中的计划原则。
    从赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中大家知道了，在第六个五年计划期间，在我们工业部门和机关中将过渡到7小时工作制。在这方面以及进一步大大提高职工的实际工资方面和许多其他措施中，都表现了党对改善劳动人民生活的一贯的特别关怀。
    党公开地大胆地揭露在经济和文化建设各个部门中存在的重大缺点。同时，党还在争取尽力改进和精简国家机关以及保证最严格地遵守法制。在所有这些方面，党依靠工人、集体农民和知识分子的支持和积极的协助。
        一、国际形势的根本变化
          和防止新战争的可能性
    第二次世界大战是对苏联的社会主义社会制度和国家制度最严重的考验。而这次考验表明，依靠人民的全力支持的社会主义国家，拥有取之不尽的精神力量和物质力量的源泉。
    尽管苏联在第二次世界大战中是担负主要的战争重担的国家之一，但是我们的国家在战后的短短的时期内就重新走上了国民经济和文化建设急剧高涨的道路。大家知道，正在建设社会主义的各人民民主国家也在胜利地解决着自己的任务。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家之间的关系，正在巩固的友好基础上和基本目标一致的情况下日益发展。共产党和工人党的久经考验的领导，保证了各个社会主义国家的不断前进。在最近时期的所有事变中，不能不指出中国的社会主义建设的成就，中国人民获得的这些巨大成就，使他们不愧为伟大的中国人民（经久不息的掌声）。所有这一切就得以形成强大的和平、民主和社会主义国家阵营。
      这个阵营的形成，具有非常重大的国际意义。组成这个阵营
  的各国的经验，表明了建设社会主义事业方面的各种不同途径，空前地扩大了社会主义影响的可能性和范围。同时，这个阵营是各资本主义国家的工人阶级和全体劳动人民在他们争取自己的权利和争取改善生活的斗争中的可靠支柱。殖民地和附属国的人民懂得，这个阵营的强大和进一步巩固，对争取和巩固他们的自由和民族独立具有重大的意义。（掌声）
    现在，和世界资本主义体系并存的有世界社会主义体系。历史已经把这两个体系和平共处的问题提到日程上来了。当然，必须估计到这两个体系之间的意见分歧和争论是不可避免的。因此，必须明确地回答下面的问题：应该怎样解决已经有的和事变进程中正在发生的各种争执问题。
    解决争执只有两条道路：一条道路是谈判和和平调解意见分歧；另一条道路是战争。其他道路是没有的。苏联和所有其他社会主义国家坚决反对战争的道路。我们将尽力使两个对立体系的拥护者都承认两个体系和平共处的原则，我们并且将竭尽全力通过谈判来解决业已成熟的和正在发生的国际问题，以维护和巩固各国人民的和平和安全。（经久不息的掌声）
    因此，必须特别强调指出，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中及时提出了一系列关于目前国际发展的原则问题，特别是关于在目前时代防止战争的可能性的问题。千千万万的人们都亲身经历过两次世界大战，深深知道战争所造成的流血的结果、无数的灾难和牺牲。在这两次战争中，死伤人数在8，000万以上。在现代的条件下，新的世界大战将会带来更大得不可估计的破坏和危险。结论只有一个：为了全人类的利益，我们必须竭尽一切力量，不放过任何机会来保卫和平，揭露反对和平的阴谋，团结各国人民来反对帝国主义的侵略势力，来保卫各国人民之间的和平、友谊和友好合作。（掌声）
    我们大家都记得列宁的著名论点：只要帝国主义存在，战争便不可避免。在帝国主义占统治的条件下，各国除了用武力而最后用战争以外，是无法解决自己的矛盾的。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们说，一方面，在帝国主义条件下，存在着产生战争的经济基础，另一方面，帝国主义本身也产生着要求消灭帝国主义战争和帝国主义本身的社会力量。这种社会力量在一定条件下，会成为足以能够制止战争和消灭帝国主义战争的力量。因此，认为战争注定不可避免的看法是不正确的。
    当然，在目前条件下，既然存在着帝国主义，新的世界大战的危险性也就仍然存在，至于其他的军事冲突就更不用说了。
    但是，过去是存在着战争危险而无力防止，至少是没有真正巨大的力量来加以防止。而现在这种力量——并且是不小的力量——已经成为事实，由于它的出现，已经造成了防止战争的真正可能性。（掌声）
    当然，不能够不考虑到，一些带有最大的侵略性的帝国主义集团正在处心积虑地制造各种计划，企图扭转历史的发展。大家知道的“威慑”计划，特别是充满着对社会主义国家进行侵略的气味的“解放计划”，就是这种企图的具体表现。但是，制定这种计划——妄想用暴力在社会主义国家恢复资本主义的计划——是一回事，而在现在条件下是否能够实现这种计划，就完全是另外一回事了，因为苏联的存在和发展的全部历史已经光辉地证明了这种计划是不可能实现的。（经久不息的掌声）
    大家都看得很清楚，自从第一次、特别是第二次世界大战以来，国际局势发生了多么深刻的变化。现在每一个有理智的人都看得见，阶级力量、政治力量的对比已经发生了变化，帝国主义的地位已经大大削弱，社会主义的地位已经大大加强；和这同时，许多其他反对战争的力量也大大加强了。所有这一切使我们能够得出这样一个结论：在战争是否会发生这个问题上，现在情况已经完全不同于第二次世界大战以前的情况，更不同于1914—1918年大战以前的情况。
    当时，即在第一次世界大战以前，工人阶级的各个社会主义政党曾经提出制止战争的任务。早在那时，“用战争制止战争”的口号就已经深入人心，它掌握了许多国家的工人阶级广大阶层。然而在帝国主义第一次世界大战发生的决定关头，国际无产阶级在政治上还是软弱的，而且被第二国际各党的首领们的背叛行为所分裂。只有我们布尔什维克的、列宁的党，才彻底地坚持了坚决反对帝国主义和帝国主义战争的立场，在其他国家中则只有个别的社会主义者才保持了对无产阶级国际主义的忠诚。大家也都知道，我们党的这种立场，不但对伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，而且对加速结束第一次世界大战，都起了极其重要的作用。
    在第二次世界大战以前的时期，苏联坚持不懈地捍卫和平，并且号召其他国家联合起来反对发动新的世界大战。虽然德国法西斯及其侵略同盟者准备第二次世界大战已经是有目共睹，但是其他国家并没有接受苏联的建议，来阻止战争。他们甚至企图引导德国法西斯的侵略力量来反对苏联，大家都知道，他们拟定了“借刀杀人”的计划。
    当时苏联是唯一的社会主义国家，它和同情它的其他各国爱好和平的人们，还没有足够的力量来粉碎各个最反动的帝国主义国家的战争计划。在这种情况之下开始了第二次世界大战。
    这次大战的结果证明，列宁是完全正确的，他早在1915年年中就已经写道：
    战争的经验，也像历史上一切危机的经验以及人类生活中一切大灾难和一切转变的经验一样，愚化和损伤一部分人，但同时却开导和锻炼另一部分人，而且一般地讲来，在全世界的历史上，后一部分人的数量和力量会多于前一部分人，某一国家的衰落和灭亡的个别情形，则不在此例。”（列宁全集第21卷第191—192页）
    第二次世界大战同第一次世界大战比较起来，在更大程度上开导和锻炼了千百万人。
    在第二次世界大战的进程中和在第二次世界大战结束以后，在很多国家中，新的社会力量和政治力量产生了，振奋起来了，并且团结起来了，这些力量在历史舞台上的出现，根本改变了世界政治状况，大大地鼓舞了各国人民的力量，同时，战争也使政治生活发生了巨大的变化，特别是在欧洲和亚洲的一些国家里。
    现在存在着社会制度和国家制度根本不同的两个世界国家阵营。除了世界帝国主义阵营之外，世界社会主义阵营建立起来了，它包括了欧洲和亚洲的九亿多人口，即全世界三分之一以上的人口，如果说在帝国主义国家阵营中，那些力图保持自己的统治地位和特权地位甚至力图发动新的战争的阶级和集团还仍然起着决定性作用，那末，在社会主义阵营的国家中，情况却完全不同。
    现在，和某些帝国主义国家的最富有侵略性的集团正在从事准备新战争的同时，社会主义阵营的国家却把维护和平和巩固和平、争取各国人民之间的和平、友好和合作当作自己的主要任务。因此，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家，不仅是自己国家的人民、而且也是所有其他各国人民（这里是指真正的人民群众）的最深刻的、最切身的利益的代表者。
    在和平问题上，一切国家的人民的利益（不管这些国家的社会制度和国家制度如何）都是和社会主义阵营各国的利益一致的，因为社会主义阵营坚持不懈地维护各国人民之间的普遍和平、友谊和合作。
    我们不应该过低估计战争的危险，不应该醉心于这样的幻想：认为对我们说来在任何条件下，都可以得到和平，都可以过安宁的生活。我们应该时时刻刻提高警惕，机警地注视帝国主义者的侵略计划。我们不应该高枕无忧，认为似乎可以用好话和爱好和平的计划说服帝国主义者。这一切只有在下列情况下才有意义：我们同时还执行正确的国内政策和对外政策；每一个社会主义国家中的劳动人民愈来愈紧密地团结成一个友好的大家庭；这些国家的人民之间的友好和互助的兄弟同盟得到巩固；其他国家的人民将越来越同情我们的和平和国际合作的政策；我们将更加关心人民福利的增长，关心所有那些符合于保障各社会主义国家的真正安全的利益的必要条件。（掌声）
    我们也不应该过低估计我们在维护和保障和平的事业中的力量和许多潜力。在这方面估计不足，会妨碍我们利用所有那些在第二次世界大战后在世界各处出现、并且不断成长起来的力量，来维护和巩固和平。另一方面，我们对战后的新的形势有了应有的理解，对力求防止新战争和维护和平事业的各国人民的物质力量和精神力量的蓬勃发展有了认识，我们就会担负起极大的责任，即切实地准备和组织这些力量，巩固和发展这些力量，以利于各国人民之间的和平、友好和合作，以利于防止新战争。
    现在，就是同社会主义敌对的阵营中的那些人也清楚地知道，我们拥有极大的物质力量和高度的技术成就，其中包括最强有力的和各种各样的最新式的武器，一旦需要的话，我们可以用它们来实行必要的自卫。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）应该想到，在这方面，我们的敌人现在已经放弃了他们不久以前还存在过的很多幻想。我们要努力做到使自己在物质技术力量方面变得更有力量、更有组织和更加强大，并且拥有一切为保证安全和击退侵略所必需的最完备的手段。（经久不息的掌声）我们在这方面的潜力并不比另一个阵营小。我们的物质资源、最新的技术成就、众多的人力、我们各族人民的巩固友谊以及他们在精神上和政治上的团结一致，使我们深信，社会主义阵营是不可战胜的。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    现在事实已经如此明显，它一定会影响到那些对自己统治世界的战争计划抱有希望的集团，因为这些计划在现代国际条件下，已经失去任何实际意义，而且首先对于那些企图发动新世界战争的人来说，是很危险的。除此以外，资本主义国家的实业界也有不少的人反对政治上的冒险主义和胡作乱为，他们宁愿发展各国之间的实际经济联系，不管这些国家的社会制度有何区别；而发展经济联系是具有非常广泛的可能性的。
    同时，不要忘记，在历史考验中，起决定作用的是人民，是他们的团结和对自己正义事业的信念。在国内战争的英雄年代里，在伟大的卫国战争中，在决定着苏维埃国家生死存亡的问题的时刻，在我国人民不仅保卫了自己的社会主义祖国、而且也保障了促使社会主义力量进一步发展的最伟大成就的那些年代里，我国人民特别令人信服地证明了这一点。
    现在，我们有充分的理由说，整个社会主义阵营各国人民在精神上和政治上的团结一致正在不断地加强。各个社会主义国家的人民已经团结起来，他们的友谊正在加强和巩固，这是各个独立自主国家之间的亲密的全面的兄弟合作。这种情况大大加强了这些国家的力量和潜力。侵略者即使敢于进攻某个社会主义国家，也不得不考虑到上述这一切情况。（掌声）
    在保卫和平的问题上，现在已经形成了一种我们在10年或15年以前只能当作一种理想的国际环境。
    问题不仅在于苏联作为一个受敌对的资本主义包围的唯一社会主义国家的时期已经成为过去，而且在于现在已经形成了一个强大的和平堡垒——欧洲和亚洲国家所组成的社会主义阵营。在保卫和平的问题上，我们的同盟者在这个阵营以外也愈来愈多。
    在现在的条件下，保卫和平的不仅有团结在社会主义旗帜下的各国人民，而且还有不少其他国家的人民，特别是那些昨天还完全附属帝国主义而现在则走上了独立的民族生活道路的国家的人民，他们目前公开表示反对侵略计划。这些国家的人民和政府懂得，侵略集团正在推行的准备战争和建立军事集团的政策，对于他们已经争取到的独立是一种危险。
    因此，必须谈谈目前殖民体系瓦解的世界历史意义。亚非独立国家的建立，促进了和平和国际合作的巩固。应当提到的是五项和平原则，这五项原则是由印度和中华人民共和国为了维护各国人民的自由、独立和和平共处的事业而宣布的，后来，这五项原则又在全世界得到了积极和巨大的响应。这里必须提到有29个亚非国家参加的万隆会议，这个会议表明，摆脱了——虽然还不是到处都完全摆脱了——殖民主义压迫的亚非各国人民在国际事务中的作用是如何地增大了。
    正在发展起来的反殖民主义运动包括了亚洲最广大的群众，并且也开始在非洲日益展开。这些群众力求改善自己的状况，他们为此正在尽量利用刚刚产生的各种有利条件。他们不但对新战争不感兴趣，而且正在全力反对帝国主义、反对帝国主义战争。
    大家知道，在资本主义国家里，人民群众也展开了广泛的反战运动，即保卫和平的运动。参加这一运动的不仅有全部觉悟的工人、很大一部分农民和知识分子，而且还有愈来愈多的资产阶级出身的人士。还有其他许多人，虽然没有参加保卫和平的运动，但是已经意识到新的世界大战的极端危险性；他们的呼声也同保卫和平的运动汇合在一起了。
    侵略者以前在实现自己的计划的时候，从来没有碰到过这样大的困难，因为他们在执行自己的政策的时候，已经不能够指望各族人民还会甘心情愿、逆来顺受。但是我们不能够因此而自安自慰，任其自流。
    我们知道，帝国主义者为了继续进行军备竞赛，煽动战争狂热，并且利用这种气氛来制定新的侵略战争计划，他们使用的手段是多么多、多么复杂。我们知道，他们为了达到这些目的，是怎样广泛地利用了资产阶级报刊、无线电、电影和其他一切宣传工具。我们不应该低估这一切，这样才能够使各国人民对任何新的准备战争的计划的反抗和回击不但不削弱，而且大大加强。我们应当比以前做更多的工作，这样才能使一切国家中的社会进步力量和广大群众的积极性、团结性不断增长，以达到制止战争的目的。
    我们决不能断定说，我们似乎已经做了一切必要的事情使新战争不可能发生了。我们往往还做了那些在过去、在第二次世界大战以前形成的习惯和陈规的俘虏，这些习惯和陈规现在正阻碍着我们去利用新的、更广泛和更积极的反对战争的斗争形式。我们往往还过低估计战后时期出现的新的可能性。这种缺点在外交部的工作中也有所表现。我们党的中央委员会及时地指出了这一点。我们应当消除这种情况，消除对我们在保卫各国人民的和平和安全的事业中所具有的那些巨大可能性估计不足的情况。这种巨大可能性的基础就是世界社会主义阵营的形成和它的力量的不断增长，殖民地和附属国人民解放斗争的空前高涨，各资本主义国家中战斗的工人运动和工人阶级的国际主义团结，广泛展开的保卫和平的民主运动，妇女和青年民主组织的活动，以及其他各种保卫和平、反对战争的群众性斗争形式。（掌声）
    我们党在拟定外交政策时的出发点是：必须十分认真地考虑具体条件，必须了解当前的情况和历史发展的前景。对实行外交政策方针上的原则性和灵活性作列宁主义的结合，这就是我们党在解决国际问题上获得成功的保证。
    我们保卫和平和不让新的世界大战发生的愿望，依靠着社会主义国家合作的不可战胜性，依靠着这样一些非社会主义国家越来越大的支持，这些国家反对与和平的利益相抵触的军事集团，拥护社会制度和国家制度不同的国家和平共处的原则。大家都清楚，像印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、埃及等等这样一些国家的立场在巩固和平方面起着多么大的作用。
    我们在为粉碎战争鼓吹者的计划而进行的斗争中，应当对下列情况根据列宁主义原则加以考虑，即在各个侵略集团的成员国之间存在着而且滋长着经济矛盾和政治矛盾，这种矛盾是不可避免的，因为这类集团中的最强的成员国力图靠牺牲自己伙伴来加强自己的帝国主义地位。这种矛盾削弱了侵略势力，同时增加了保卫和平的可能性。
    和平的利益和反对新战争危险的利益要求：在工人阶级中建立团结的问题，应当成为共产党和社会党注意的中心。工人阶级队伍中的分裂已经两次被侵略势力利用来准备和发动世界大战，工人阶级不能不从这个事实中吸取教训。这种分裂决不能用这种理由来解释：说共产党人和社会党人对争取社会主义的途径和方法的理解以及在使各国人民免除新战争威胁这一极其重要的问题上有不同的意见。如果工人阶级保证自己队伍的团结，国际无产阶级的团结将成为战争势力的不可克服的阻碍。如果工人阶级在行动中团结自己的力量，并且彻底表现出捍卫和平的决心，战争就不会发生。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
      二、苏联争取和平和国际安全
    赫鲁晓夫同志的报告中已经对国际局势作了详尽的分析，所以这里没有必要论述反映出苏联政府在过去一个时期中的和平倡议的事实和措施。只需要着重指出去年的若干事件和我们的缓和国际紧张局势的总的外交方针的重大的国际意义就可以了。
    这里是指同兄弟的南斯拉夫人民的友好关系的恢复，这种关系现在发展得越来越顺利，它不单是有利于我们两国，而且有利于加强和平和国际安全。如果苏联和南斯拉夫之间存在了几年的不正常的关系继续拖延下去，只会对敌视和平的人有利。
    这里也是指缔结关于奥地利的条约，同意奥地利实行永久中立的政策，在欧洲和世界其他地区如此坚决地建立一个又一个新的军事侵略集团的国家也应该同意这一点；与苏联和德意志民主共和国的友好关系进一步发展的同时，苏联和德意志联邦共和国外交关系的建立，也有助于巩固欧洲和平的事业。苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议得到了广泛的响应。苏联政府完全支持中华人民共和国的关于亚洲集体安全的建议。苏联继续始终如一地为裁减军备和禁止原子武器而斗争。
    去年7月的日内瓦四国政府首脑会议占有特殊的地位。它明显地表明了缓和国际紧张局势、改善苏联同另一个阵营各主要国家的关系的现实可能性。但是事态的进一步的演变表明，在改善同这些国家的关系的道路上还有不少障碍，这些障碍是眼光短浅的“实力地位”政策的拥护者所造成的，然而拿这种政策来对待苏联和其他社会主义国家，不可避免地会遭到失败。
    欧洲、美洲、东南亚、中近东的一系列的侵略集团以及一系列其他事件的策动者，主要是某些美国人士，这是大家都知道的。像北大西洋集团这样一个由美国和英国所领导的军事集团在这方面起着特殊的作用，这也是大家知道的。正是由于美国某些人士加紧施加压力，参加北大西洋集团和其他侵略集团的一系列国家的政府才急急忙忙地扩充军备和扩大军事预算，拧紧税收压榨机的螺丝，在居民中故意地鼓吹战争歇斯底里，向全世界散播关于苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家有侵略意图的诬蔑言论。
    当希特勒统治崩溃之后和爱好和平的德意志民主共和国成立之后，现在在欧洲大陆上已经没有这样一个侵略国家，它在目前情况下还敢于发动新的世界大战，侵犯苏联或者人民民主国家。在战前的一些年代里，希特勒德国是一步一步地在发动第二次世界大战，现在在欧洲已经和当时不同了。然而，我们不能不注意到西德重新军国主义化的计划，西德已被拉进了像北大西洋集团和西欧军事联盟这样一些侵略性的军事集团。毫无疑问，西德的重新军国主义化会加深矛盾和增加冲突的可能性，其中包括帝国主义国家本身之间的矛盾和冲突。
    在东方，也已经开始了新的时代。在军国主义的日本失败和中华人民共和国成立以后，现在在亚洲已经没有敢于发动第三次世界大战的侵略国家了。因为中华人民共和国已经充分证明它能够捍卫自己的民族利益，并且它坚持不渝地执行着和平政策。现在，如果撇开南朝鲜不谈，那末在亚洲，主要地就是由于台湾岛变成了美国的军事基地，因而还存在着侵略的危险。如果不是计划侵略伟大的中国，那么建立这种军事基地是不必要的。
    事实证明，在进一步缓和国际紧张局势的道路上，还有不少障碍。但是，尽管在这个道路上存在着、而且还在不断地产生着障碍，苏联过去表示，现在也同样表示愿意进一步改善自己和其他国家的关系的坚定决心。
    我们认为，各个国家，首先是各个大国——尽管它们之间还存在着意见分歧，——应该为了维护和平的共同利益而联合起来。
    每个人都知道，在保证普遍和平方面，在很大程度上要取决于苏联和美国关系的根本改善。我们认为，这是苏联人民而且也是美国人民，以及其他各国人民所关心的事情。因此，苏联政府在由尼·亚·布尔加宁写给美国总统德·艾森豪威尔的大家都知道的信中，提出了签订苏美友好合作条约的建议。美国政府对待苏联建议的态度，说明现在在美国主张用战争而不用谈判方法解决悬而未决的问题的集团是很有势力的，他们对总统和政府起着一定的影响。但是要知道，美国人民的利益和其他各国人民的利益要求更加关心和平。在这种情况下，可以想像我们对改善苏美关系的努力，在美国将会得到应有的了解。
    苏联政府向美国提出了签订友好合作条约的建议，从而再次表现了希望苏美两国友好合作以有利于和平和普遍安全的真诚愿望。这符合联合国的精神和宗旨以及扩大各国之间的合作的愿望。
    我们争取改善同英国的关系的愿望仍旧不变。我们国家的领导人物将到英国去进行的访问，提供新的机会来取得更好的相互谅解和在进一步缓和国际紧张局势方面进行共同的努力。
    苏联也希望同法国建立友好的关系，法国现任政府已经表示了一定的愿望要改善法苏两国的关系。既然法国政府对裁军问题表示了特别的兴趣，我们将设法同法国共同谋求在解决这个问题方面取得一定的进展。应该认为，在最近议会选举中民主力量的地位的加强，将有助于达到这个目的。
    我们的国家无论过去和现在都主张同一切大小国家发展友好的关系。它特别希望也能够同土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦和日本建立起这种关系。这些国家同苏联建立起良好的关系不会不符合它们自己的切身利益的。
    为了尽可能的扩大争取和平的斗争的战线，我们的党和苏维埃政府在缓和国际紧张局势的旗帜下展开了这个斗争。这个缓和国际紧张局势的政策，是在当前的条件下争取和平的斗争的一种特殊表现。缓和国际紧张局势的政策是争取和平的斗争的最得人心的和最灵活的手段，并且在当前的条件下提供了最广泛的可能性来把具有各种不同的政治见解的广大社会阶层吸引到这个事业中来。这个政策把争取和平的斗争扩大到它的通常范围以外了，包括了经济和文化利益的范围，不仅同国家机构和社会机构发生关系，也同私人发生关系。
    不仅外交家和政治家能够促进国际紧张局势的缓和，而且经济工作者、文化工作者、国家的官方代表以及在国务活动、社会活动和私人活动的各个方面促成发展各国之间的友好关系和合作的所有其他的人，都能够促进国际紧张局势的缓和。现在侵略集团采取许许多多的步骤来阻碍各国之间贸易关系的发展，这并不是偶然的。某些国家在最平常的科学联系、技术联系和纯粹的文化联系的发展的道路上设置种种障碍，这当然也不是偶然的。
    同志们！我们的党和苏维埃政府一向捍卫和平的利益。我们国家的外交政策是在共产党和党中央委员会的领导下执行的。正是由于这一点首先使我们有保证在加强苏联的国际地位和保卫世界和平方面取得成就。（掌声）
    我们在国内生活方面的重大成就和在外交政策方面的重大成就，是同中央委员会在第十九次代表大会以后实行列宁主义的集体领导原则这一点有关系的。（掌声）得到全党支持的中央委员会坚决地反对了同马克思列宁主义毫不相容的、而在一定时期内起了不良影响的个人崇拜。可以相信，这一次代表大会将完全赞同这一原则性方针。（掌声）
    为了缓和国际紧张局势和加强苏维埃国家的地位，党的领导表现了真正大胆的倡导精神，采取了一系列重要的步骤。
    我们党的中央委员会及其主席团在过去也许从来还没有像最近一段时期这样积极地处理外交政策问题。大家都还记得这样一些事情：例如，以赫鲁晓夫同志、布尔加宁同志和米高扬同志为首的政府代表团的访问南斯拉夫，代表团使得苏南关系有了根本转变；又如，布尔加宁同志和赫鲁晓夫同志的访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗，这次访问在发展苏联同这些国家及其政府和人民的友好关系方面取得了重大成就。还必须指出同德意志联邦共和国以及随后的同德意志民主共和国的莫斯科谈判、去年秋天进行的同芬兰、挪威等国的谈判。苏联领导人同外国人士、外国代表团和报界人士的会晤大大增多了。所有这些都证明了苏联的国家和党的领导人物最近时期在外交政策方面表现出的积极性。正是由于这一切，我们才取得了积极的结果，使得国际紧张局势有了某些缓和，并且为在这方面取得进一步的成就创造了一定的可能性。（掌声）党和苏维埃政府在保障和平方面取得了一定的成就。我国人民和整个社会主义阵营的物质力量和精神力量的不断增长是这些成就的基础。
    这就是说，每一个苏联人以及社会主义阵营各国的每一个公民，以自己的胜利的劳动和在工业企业和集体农庄中取得的成绩，在大大小小的工作上都为巩固自己的国家和巩固整个社会主义阵营的事业作出了贡献，从而也就为维护和巩固和平和国际安全的事业作出了贡献。（掌声）当我们在不断争取提高工厂中的劳动生产率的时候，当我们能够保证在提高集体农庄和国营农场的田地单位面积产量和畜产品生产率方面取得新的成就的时候，我们就有充分的权利为共产主义建设中的这些成就而骄傲。同时，这些成就也是加强整个社会主义阵营的力量和阵地的基础，从而为保障各国人民过和平和安宁的生活创造了决定性的条件。（掌声）
    我们在经济和文化建设中的成就鼓舞着全世界各国人民。他们对这一点很满意，并且从而深信自己有了一条由千百万人走过的、把人们引向新的、幸福生活的可靠道路。在世界各国，我们的朋友和同盟者的队伍正在不断扩大，他们同我们共产党人一样，要维护和平，要消灭帝国主义战争，他们愈来愈相信，要制止新战争，今天在很大程度上要靠人民的觉悟和积极性。
    苏联同社会主义阵营其他国家一起，站在为和平及共产主义的胜利而斗争的前哨，我们的队伍空前团结了，对最后胜利的信心空前提高了！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    过去和现在指导我们获得胜利的旗帜是马克思列宁主义的旗帜。在这个旗帜下我们向前迈进，我们深信自己将获得新的成就，深信共产主义的胜利。
    我们的伟大建设和我们争取和平的一贯斗争，是符合各国人民的利益的，是符合全人类的利益的！（暴风雨般的经久不歇的掌声）　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科20日电）
