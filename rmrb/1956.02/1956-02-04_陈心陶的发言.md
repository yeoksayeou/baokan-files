Comrade Chairman, fellow members:

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the Central People's Government, China has made unprecedented progress in all aspects. In just six years, we have completed the third year of the First Five-Year Plan and are facing a high tide of national agricultural cooperativization. I am extremely happy to be able to participate in the plenary session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at this time. I would like to express my warm support for the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai and other leading comrades.

The "Draft National Agricultural Development Program Outline from 1956 to 1967" proposed by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee points out a vision for us. At the same time, it can be seen that this beautiful vision must be realized through the joint efforts of scientists in all fields. Scientists who shoulder such an important task must have a high level of Marxist-Leninist knowledge, constantly transform themselves, keep up with the times, and contribute all their strength to accelerate the completion of the socialist construction cause. As a scientific worker, I must work hard in this direction.

In the National Agricultural Development Program Outline, what excites me most is the goal of eliminating diseases that are most harmful to the people within a certain period. In history, no country has had the魄力 (po4 li4 - boldness) and courage to propose eliminating a series of difficult-to-eliminate diseases. Taking schistosomiasis as an example, the epidemic area of ​​this disease covers 12 provinces (excluding Guizhou) in the Yangtze River and south of the Yangtze River. Approximately more than 10 million people suffer from this disease, and 100 million people are directly threatened. The majority of patients are young people in rural areas, which not only greatly affects the labor force, but also causes many deaths due to this disease. Although countries such as Japan and Egypt have been carrying out prevention and control work for more than half a century, they have not achieved much. We now have sufficient conditions to propose to eliminate schistosomiasis within seven years. I am confident that we will be able to eliminate them within this time frame.

The work of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis does have certain difficulties. In the life history of schistosomes, we do not yet have a perfect method to completely break any link in it. For example, fecal management cannot guarantee the complete elimination of the source of parasite eggs; water source management cannot guarantee the elimination of opportunities for water pollution; various methods of killing the intermediate host of schistosomes, Oncomelania hupensis snails, cannot guarantee their complete elimination; and there is no 100% effective drug for treating patients. What is even more difficult is that in addition to humans, cattle, dogs, rats, and other animals are also infected with schistosomiasis. Because of the above-mentioned difficulties, the prevention and control of schistosomiasis must take comprehensive measures and attack all links in the life history of schistosomes at the same time, so that there is hope of achieving the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis.

In Guangdong Province, we have explored some experiences based on the living rules of Oncomelania hupensis snails and in combination with agricultural production conditions. In most parts of Qujiang and other counties, Oncomelania hupensis snails live in the irrigation ditches beside the paddy fields. Before sowing, farmers must first do a good job of repairing the ditches. The farmers' own method of repairing the ditches cannot eliminate the Oncomelania hupensis snails, and because they have always dumped the shoveled-out soil into the paddy fields, the paddy fields, which originally had only a very small number of Oncomelania hupensis snails, have a large number of Oncomelania hupensis snails, thereby increasing the chances of farmers getting infected. From the point of view of prevention and control work, if the method of farmers digging ditches can be improved, most of the Oncomelania hupensis snails can be eliminated. Therefore, we have carried out publicity and education to require farmers to achieve no weeds, no loose soil, and no mud holes (temporarily called advanced ditch digging method) when repairing ditches, so that Oncomelania hupensis snails have nowhere to hide and eventually die. In addition, bury the shoveled-out soil underground so that the Oncomelania hupensis snails cannot turn over. According to this method of digging ditches, most of the Oncomelania hupensis snails die quickly because the living environment changes. Farmers are happy to accept this improved method of digging ditches, because this practice is in line with their production methods and is beneficial to them without harm.

However, in some areas of Guangdong, the ditch digging method will not work. Because Oncomelania hupensis snails do not live in ditches. In Sanshui, Sihui, and Qingyuan counties, the main growing area of Oncomelania hupensis snails is the swamp area. When the spring water rises, it is a vast ocean; in autumn and winter, it is a dry land full of weeds. Except for farmers catching fish and shrimp after the water recedes, there is no other production in this area. According to the living rules of Oncomelania hupensis snails, if this wasteland can be changed into cultivated land, their elimination is destined. Therefore, we have proposed building dikes to reclaim land, so that water cannot enter, and the swamp will become dry land. In order to accelerate the death of Oncomelania hupensis snails, cut down the original weeds, dry them in the sun, and burn them with fire. This not only kills many Oncomelania hupensis snails, but also plays a fertilizing role. Finally, tractors can be used to turn the soil, so that the remaining Oncomelania hupensis snails are buried in the soil. At this stage, not only have most of the Oncomelania hupensis snails been eliminated, but a large-scale farm is also gradually taking shape. A swamp area at the junction of Sanshui and Sihui counties in Guangdong has an area of ​​80,000 mu. After this originally useless wasteland is disposed of, not only can schistosomiasis be basically eliminated, but it can also be turned into a useful cultivated land.

The construction of farmland water conservancy is an important link indispensable for increasing production in rural areas. If this work can be combined with the elimination of schistosomiasis, the results will be great. At a time when the national agricultural cooperativization is reaching a climax, combining agricultural production to eliminate schistosomiasis is a method worth considering.

    陈心陶的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我国自从解放后，在党和中央人民政府领导下，各方面都有空前的进步。在短短的6年中，我们已经完成了第一个五年计划的第三年计划，而且正面临着全国农业合作化的高潮之中。我能够在这个时候参加中国人民政协全国委员会全体会议，是一件最高兴的事情。我在这里表示热烈拥护总理和其他领导同志的报告。
    中共中央政治局提出的“1956到1967年全国农业发展纲要”草案，给我们指出了一个远景，同时也可以看出这个美好的远景，必须由各方面的科学家共同努力才能实现。负起这样的一个重要任务的科学家，必须有高度马列主义的知识，不断地改造自己，要跟上时代，并且要为加速完成社会主义建设事业而贡献出自己的一切力量。作为一个科学工作者，我一定要努力朝着这个方向走。
    在全国农业发展纲要中，我最感兴奋的是，要在一定的期限中，消灭危害人民最严重的疾病。在历史上还没有一个国家有这样的魄力和胆量，敢于提出要消灭一连串难于消灭的疾病。就以血吸虫病来说，这种病的流行区遍及长江以及长江以南的12省（贵州除外），大约有1，000余万人患这种病，并有1亿人直接受到威胁。患者以农村中的青年人占多数，不但劳动力受到莫大的影响，而且很多因为这种病而至死亡。在日本、埃及等国家虽然已经做了半世纪以上的防治工作，但并没有什么成就。我们现在提出要在7年内消灭血吸虫病是有足够的条件的。我有信心一定能够在这个期限内把它们消灭。
    防治血吸虫病的工作，是存在着一定的困难的。在血吸虫的生活史中，我们还没有一个完善方法能够彻底击破其任何一个环节。例如：粪便管理不能保证根绝虫卵的来源；水源管理不能保证消除水被污染的机会；各种杀灭血吸虫中间寄主——丁螺的方法也不能保证彻底消灭它们；治疗病人，也没有一种百分之百有效的药物。更困难的是除了人以外，牛、狗、鼠以及其他动物也有血吸虫的感染。因为上述的种种困难，所以防治血吸虫病必须采取综合措施，向血吸虫生活史的各环节同时进攻，然后才有希望达到消灭血吸虫病的目的。
    在广东省，我们根据丁螺生活的规律，并结合农业生产的情况，曾经摸索了一些经验。在曲江等县极大部分的丁螺是生活在稻田旁边的灌溉沟渠内。农民在播种前必须先做好修沟工作，农民自己的修沟方法，不但不能消灭丁螺，而且因为他们一向都是把铲出的泥土倒入稻田，使本来只有极少数丁螺的稻田，而出现了大批的丁螺，因而增加了农民得到感染的机会。从防治工作的观点来看，如果能够把农民铲沟的方法加以改善，就可以消灭绝大部分的丁螺。因此，我们就通过宣传教育，要农民在修沟时，做到无杂草、无松泥、无泥洞（暂称为高级铲沟法），使丁螺无处藏身，而终至死亡。另外，把铲出的泥土埋入地下，使丁螺无法翻身。依照这样的铲沟法，绝大部分的丁螺，因为生活的环境的改变，都很快死亡。农民对这个改善铲沟方法都乐于接受，因为这样做法，正是符合他们的生产方式，对于他们是有利而无害的。
    但是，在广东的有些地区，铲沟法就行不通。因为丁螺不生活在沟渠内。在三水、四会及清远三县，丁螺的主要生长地为沼泽地带。春水涨时，一片汪洋；秋冬二季，一片干地，满生杂草。除了在水退后，农民捕捉鱼虾之外，这种地区并无其他生产。根据丁螺的生活规律，如果能够把这种荒地改为耕地，则它们的消灭是注定的。因此，我们曾经提出筑堤开垦，使水不能进去，而沼泽就会变为干地。为了加速丁螺的死亡，再把原来的杂草割下晒干，并以火烧之，这不但烧死了许多丁螺，烧余下来的草灰还起了施肥的作用。最后，还可以用拖拉机翻土，使余下的丁螺埋入土中。到了这个阶段，不但绝大部分的丁螺都已消灭，一个规模很大的农场也在逐渐形成中。广东三水与四会二县交界的一个沼泽区，就有8万亩的面积，这个本来无用的荒地，经过处置之后，不但血吸虫病可以基本消灭，而且还可以变为一块有用的耕地。
    兴修农田水利，为农村增产不可缺的一个重要环节。如果能够把这种工作和消灭血吸虫病结合起来，则收效必大。在全国农业合作化正达到高潮的时候，结合农业生产来消灭血吸虫病，是值得考虑的一个方法。
