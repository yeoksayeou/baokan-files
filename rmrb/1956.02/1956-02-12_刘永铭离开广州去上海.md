Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th: Liu Yongming, a former Chinese student in the United States, left Guangzhou for Shanghai this afternoon. Accompanying him were his wife, Gui Qionghua, his daughter, Meimei, and his younger brother, Liu Yongchang. He will pass through Shanghai to go to Beijing, and after arriving in Beijing, he will go to a sanatorium for treatment.

Liu Yongming had been imprisoned in a mental hospital in the United States for six years. He only returned to the embrace of the motherland from Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 7th. Huang Zhaokai, the Vice President of the Second Hospital of South China Medical College and a specialist in mental illness, who was one of the four doctors who conducted a physical examination for Liu Yongming on the 8th, told Xinhua News Agency today: "The results of the diagnosis prove that Liu Yongming is mentally unsound after being detained in the United States for six years. He suffers from schizophrenia and malnutrition, and his condition is still serious. However, with proper treatment and care, his health will gradually recover." The doctor said that he had made the most detailed possible study of the development and root causes of Liu Yongming's condition based on the existing materials. He said: "There is no doubt that if the American mental hospital authorities had sent Liu Yongming back to China in 1951 when they believed that his health condition had allowed him to return, it would have been of great benefit to his health. Because he had been treated to a certain extent, after that he should have gone home and lived a normal life under the care of his family." Dr. Huang Zhaokai said: "Unfortunately, the American authorities did not allow Liu Yongming to leave the United States at that time and imprisoned him in a mental hospital, causing him to spend five years of painful life. This undoubtedly made his illness even more serious."

    刘永铭离开广州去上海
    新华社广州11日电　中国前留美学生刘永铭今天下午离开广州去上海。和他同行的有他的妻子桂琼华和女儿美美、弟弟刘永錩。他将经过上海去北京，到北京之后，他将去疗养院疗养。
    刘永铭曾在美国的一所神经病院里被禁锢了6年之久。7日下午，他才从香港回到祖国的怀抱。在8日为刘永铭进行体格检查的4位医师之一、华南医学院第二医院副院长、精神病专家黄兆开今天对新华社记者说：“诊断的结果证明：刘永铭在美国被拘禁6年之后，在精神上是不健全的。他患有精神分裂症和营养不良，并且病情仍然严重。但是，只要有适当的治疗和护理，他的健康就会逐渐恢复起来。”这位医师说，他已经根据现有的材料对刘永铭的病情的发展经过和根由作了尽可能详尽的研究。他说：“毫无疑问，如果1951年美国精神病院方面认为刘永铭的健康状况已经容许他回国的时候就把他送回来，那末对他的健康是会大有补益的。因为他已经治疗到一定程度，在这之后就应该回家，在家人的照料下过正常的生活。”黄兆开医师说：“非常不幸的是，美国当局当时不准许刘永铭离开美国，并且把他禁锢在精神病院里，使他度过了5年的痛苦生活。这无疑使他的病越加严重了。”
