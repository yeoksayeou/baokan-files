State-owned and joint state-private coal mines under central administration
    Overproduce More Than 60,000 Tons of Raw Coal in January

The national state-owned and joint state-private coal mines under central administration overproduced more than 66,400 tons of raw coal in January compared to the state plan. The average daily coal production in January increased by more than 39% compared to the average daily output in January of last year. Fushun, Kailuan and other mines have overfulfilled their January production tasks.

In the past, the national coal mines' January plans were not completed satisfactorily. This year, the enthusiasm of coal miners in various regions is very high. They created and adopted many advanced coal mining methods, changing the past situation. Since worker Pang Guanxiang and technician Zhou Guangrui jointly created a new coal mining method in the Fushun Laohutai Mine, many workers have tried to improve production, and several advanced operating methods have emerged continuously. Mines under the Kailuan Mining Bureau launched inter-mine competitions among the same types of work. By the end of January, 24 working faces in mines under this mining bureau had implemented the advanced experience of one-shift coal mining, and production efficiency had been greatly improved, with the highest increasing from an average of 6.82 tons of coal per work shift to 12.89 tons. After the workers of the 6898 face of Zhao Ge Zhuang Mine participated in the competition, the production efficiency reached more than 11 tons of coal per work shift, an increase of 22% compared to the past. After the Li Baoshu tunneling team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau proposed to launch a competition of the same type of work to coal miners across the country, the January production plan was completed ahead of schedule on the 22nd, and a lot of explosives and detonators were saved.

    国营和中央管理的公私合营煤矿
    一月份多生产六万多吨原煤
    全国国营和中央管理的公私合营煤矿，1月份比国家计划多生产了66，400多吨原煤。1月份平均每天生产的煤炭，比去年1月份平均日产量增加39％以上。抚顺、开滦等矿都超额完成了1月份生产任务。
    全国煤矿历年来1月份计划完成得不够好。今年各地煤矿工人的劳动热情很高，创造和采用了许多先进的采煤方法，改变了过去的情况。抚顺老虎台矿自从工人庞观祥和技术员周广瑞共同创造一种新采煤方法以后，许多工人都设法改进了生产，连续出现了好几种先进的操作方法。开滦矿务局所属各矿开展了同工种矿际竞赛。到1月底止，这个矿务局所属各矿已经有24个工作面推行了一班采煤的先进经验，生产效率都大大提高，最高的已经从平均每工采煤6.82吨提高到12.89吨。赵各庄矿6898回采工作面职工参加竞赛以后，生产效率达到每工采煤11吨多，比过去提高22％。阜新矿务局李宝书掘进队向全国煤矿工人提出开展同工种竞赛的倡议以后，1月份的生产计划在22日就提前完成了，并且节省了许多火药和雷管。
