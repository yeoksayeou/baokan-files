Several Questions Regarding the Establishment of Rural Clubs
By Su Lingqi, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Lushan County Committee

The rapid development of the agricultural cooperation movement is changing customs and transforming the face of the countryside. The broad masses of peasants are eagerly seeking to learn culture, agricultural science and technology, to carry out sanitation campaigns, and to engage in cultural and recreational activities. They are demanding the establishment of clubs. In Lushan County, Henan Province, on January 3 alone, five agricultural production cooperatives went to the Cultural Center to request the purchase of radios. Chen Zhenhua Agricultural Production Cooperative of Erlangmiao Township, 5th District, spent 600 yuan to send someone to Xi'an to buy a three-purpose radio. Xin Futang’s wife said, "With the establishment of the cooperative, it won't do not to establish a club. With a club, socialist life will be even happier." An agricultural production cooperative club in Xuying Township, after everything was arranged, only then did they notify the staff of the Cultural Center: "Come and give us a speech, and hang up the sign!"

The masses’ enthusiasm for culture has prompted the leadership to pay attention to cultural work. The County Party Committee first planned cultural work in its overall plan, and all relevant departments have also made specific plans for cultural work. The District Party Committees and Township Branches have also included cultural life as an important component in their overall work plans. After the completion of the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Malou Township, the club was moved to a newly built five-room building and its facilities were improved. Three agricultural production cooperatives in Laozhuang Township are preparing to establish a joint club, and the building has long been found. More than 20 clubs have been established in Lushan County, and more than 50 are under construction. It is estimated that the number of clubs in the county will reach about 300 by February.

The primary problem in establishing clubs is that cultural departments and cadres have serious right-leaning conservative thinking. Their understanding lags behind reality, and their leadership lags behind the masses. For example, the original plan was to develop 500 clubs throughout the county by 1957, and some comrades disagreed. The plan was finally revised to 400, but after discussions in the districts and townships, it was found that this plan could be completed by spring. Now, the county has basically achieved semi-socialist cooperativization, but the club work is still based on key pilot projects. They are afraid of doing too much and causing chaos, and they worry about insufficient cadres and lack of experience, fearing that too many clubs cannot be consolidated. This kind of fear of moving forward and backward makes cultural work stagnate, falling far behind the situation. Some agricultural production cooperatives have requested the establishment of clubs several times but have not been approved. The members criticized us, saying, "The higher-level authorities approved the establishment of advanced cooperatives, but why not approve the establishment of clubs? If you don't approve it, we will do it ourselves!" The lagging of the leadership is a prominent problem. For example, in Dongcun Central Township, the original plan was to establish 4 clubs at the beginning of the year, but after a few days, the masses demanded the establishment of 13.

Secondly, the establishment of clubs in large numbers requires a rapid increase in the supply of materials, but the current supply departments are far from meeting the needs. For example, agricultural production cooperatives everywhere are calling, writing, and sending people to the county to request the purchase of radios, but the department store does not have a single one. Therefore, many agricultural production cooperatives have no choice but to send people to Xuchang, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, and Hankou to buy them, wasting manpower and resources. For example, many agricultural production cooperatives take tens or even hundreds of yuan to buy books and pictures, but the Xinhua Bookstore cannot meet the needs of the masses. Popular reading materials suitable for rural areas are often sold out immediately, and the shortage of books has become more serious in the past two months. Many books and periodicals in the past are no longer welcomed by the majority of readers. The majority of members demand books and periodicals that teach agricultural science and technology and reflect the socialist reality and prospects, and they also demand that they be popular, easy to understand, and diverse. This not only poses a huge task for bookstores but also a difficult task for authors and publishing departments. Due to the small number of bookstore staff and conservatism in their work, books and periodicals cannot penetrate every corner of the countryside, and many agricultural production cooperatives and readers cannot buy books. This phenomenon must also be eliminated.

Finally, the establishment of clubs in large numbers requires more representative meetings to be held to exchange experiences in a timely manner. It cannot be done well by relying solely on a few cultural department cadres. The strength of all parties must be used to work together. Nowadays, rural cadres and activists are asking us for experience, but we are helpless. This is because the leadership's theoretical level is not high, and it is not fully prepared mentally, so it is in a passive position in the face of the high tide.

Based on the experiences and lessons of Lushan County and the current new situation, I feel that the following issues must be paid attention to in establishing agricultural production cooperative clubs:

1.  All cultural leaders and cadres must thoroughly and repeatedly study Chairman Mao's report on "The Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) proposed by the Party Central Committee, and understand the spiritual essence of the Party Central Committee's documents from the perspective of cultural work, analyze the new situation and new tasks of the rural socialist revolution, constantly overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, revise the original plan, and formulate a practical work plan.
2.  The development of clubs should generally first establish clubs in advanced cooperatives or joint cooperatives to meet the new situation and practical needs. At present, many small cooperatives have merged into large cooperatives, and many places are already building advanced cooperatives. Establishing clubs with advanced cooperatives or joint cooperatives makes it easier to solve the problems of economic strength and key personnel, and at the same time can gradually cultivate more grassroots cultural activities backbones and activists. In the future, according to specific circumstances and needs, clubs (or branches) can also be established in production teams.
3.  A mass line leadership method should be adopted. A leadership style that is hesitant and timid cannot solve the current problem of having too few cadres and too many clubs. The County Party Committee Propaganda Department, the County Cultural Section, and the Cultural Center should work together to strengthen the leadership of the establishment of clubs, summarize and disseminate local experiences in a timely manner, guide overall work, and the cadres responsible for establishing clubs should adopt a work method that uses key points to lead the way, using work groups or representative meetings to guide the work of several surrounding townships. At the same time, we must pay close attention to relying on the leadership of the Party branch in order to mobilize greater strength to establish clubs under the unified leadership of the Party branch.
4.  The steps to establish a club should be closely combined with the current establishment of advanced cooperatives, consolidation of cooperatives, and merging of large cooperatives. The first step is to do a good job in publicizing the establishment of clubs, explaining to members the new situation of cooperation, the nature, role, and organization of clubs. The second step is to establish a preparatory committee and do all the preparatory work in conjunction with handling the specific problems of establishing advanced cooperatives and consolidating and merging large cooperatives. The third step is to formally establish a club and elect leading cadres, formulate a work plan, establish various organizations and systems, and carry out activities in conjunction with the election of agricultural production cooperatives. In this way, the establishment of a club should only take about 10 days.
5.  Various organizations within the club should be established according to the specific situation. Generally, a club management committee is established, with storage, publicity, writing, and inspection sections (or groups), drama troupes, and libraries under it. Party propagandists are absorbed to participate, and each section is staffed with several people so that they can be assigned responsibilities, frequently go deep into production teams and groups to carry out publicity activities, and use the club's premises to carry out regular mass amateur cultural activities.

    关于建立农村俱乐部的几个问题
    中共鲁山县委宣传部副部长　粟凌岐
    农业合作化运动的迅速发展，正在移风易俗，改变着农村面貌。广大农民迫切要求学习文化，迫切要求学习农业科学技术，迫切要求开展卫生运动，迫切要求开展文化娱乐活动，要求建立俱乐部。河南省鲁山县仅是1月3日那一天中，就有五个农业生产合作社到文化馆请求买收音机。5区二郎庙乡陈振华农业生产合作社拿出600元托人到西安去买回了一部三用收音机。辛福堂的妻子说：“建立了合作社，不建俱乐部，就不行，有了俱乐部，社会主义生活，就更幸福了”。徐营乡一个农业生产合作社俱乐部，到一切都安排妥当了，才通知文化馆的工作人员：“你去给俺讲讲话，挂起牌子吧！”
    群众要求文化的积极性，促使了领导对文化工作的重视。县委首先在全面规划中规划了文化工作，各有关部门也都作出了文化工作的具体规划，各区委和各乡支部也在全面工作规划中把文化生活列为重要的组成部分。马楼乡幸福农业生产合作社建成后，把俱乐部迁移到新建的五间大楼房内，充实了设备。老庄乡三个农业生产合作社准备建立联社俱乐部，房子早就找好了。鲁山县目前已建成了20多个俱乐部，还有50多个正在建立，预计到2月份全县俱乐部将发展到300个左右。
    当前在建立俱乐部工作中的首要问题是：文化主管部门和干部中存在着严重的右倾保守思想，认识落后于实际，领导落后于群众。例如原来计划全县到1957年发展500个俱乐部，有些同志还不同意，最后修改为400个，但是经过区、乡讨论结果，这一计划到春天就可以完成。现在，全县已经基本上实现了半社会主义合作化了，可是俱乐部工作还停留在重点试办的基础上，怕多、怕乱，干部不足，经验缺乏，建多了不能巩固，这种怕前顾后的结果，使文化工作停足不前，大大落在形势后面。有些农业生产合作社几次要求建立俱乐部都没被批准，社员们批评我们说：“建立高级社上级却批准了，为什么不批准建立俱乐部？不批准我们就自己搞啦！”领导落后是一个突出问题。例如在董村中心乡原来计划年初建立4个俱乐部，过了不几天，群众就要求建立13个。
    其次，俱乐部大批大批建立就要求物资供应迅速跟上去，但是当前物资供应部门远远不能满足需要。例如各地农业生产合作社纷纷向县里打电话、写信、派人要求买收音机，而百货公司却连一部也没有，因此有许多农业生产合作社就只好派人到许昌、郑州、西安和汉口去买，浪费了人力和物力。又如许多农业生产合作社拿几十元甚至百元去买书籍和图画，但是新华书店不能满足群众的需要。适合农村的通俗读物往往一下子就卖光了，近两月来书籍脱销现象更为严重。过去许多书刊已不为广大读者所欢迎；广大社员要求学习农业科学技术和反映社会主义现实和远景生活的书刊，而且要求通俗易懂，多种多样。这不仅给书店提出了巨大任务，也给作者和出版部门提出了艰巨任务。由于书店人员少和工作上的保守，使书刊不能深入到农村各个角落，许多农业生产合作社和读者买不到书，这种现象也必须消除。
    最后，俱乐部大批大批的建立，就必须多开代表会议，及时交流经验，单凭少数文化部门干部是作不好的，必须运用各方面的力量来一起搞。如今，农村干部、积极分子纷纷向我们要经验，而我们却束手无策。这是因为领导上理论水平不高，在精神上没有充分准备，所以在高潮面前就处于被动地位。
    根据鲁山县的经验教训和目前的新形势，我感觉建立农业生产合作社俱乐部必须注意以下几个问题：
    一、所有文化领导部门和干部，都必须深入反复地认真学习毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党中央提出的全国农业发展纲要（草案），从文化工作的角度来领会党中央文件的精神实质，分析农村社会主义革命的新形势和新任务，不断克服右倾保守思想，修改原来规划，订出切合实际的工作计划。
    二、俱乐部的发展，一般地应该首先在高级社或联社中建立俱乐部，以适应新情况和实际需要。目前许多小社已合并了大社，许多地方已经在建高级社，以高级社或联社建立俱乐部，经济力量和骨干分子的问题也容易解决，同时还能逐渐培养更多的群众文化活动骨干和积极分子。今后根据具体情况和需要，还可以在生产队建立俱乐部（或分部）。
    三，应当采取群众路线的领导方法。缩脚缩手的领导作风是不能解决当前干部少、俱乐部多的问题的。县委宣传部、县文化科和文化馆应该通力合作，加强对建立俱乐部工作的领导，及时地总结和传播各地经验，指导全面工作，负责建立俱乐部的干部，采取以点带面的工作方法，以工作组或代表会议的形式来指导周围几个乡的工作，同时还必须注意紧紧依靠党支部的领导，以便在党支部的统一领导下动员更大力量来建立俱乐部。
    四，建立一个俱乐部的步骤，应当同当前建立高级社、整社和并大社密切结合起来。第一步是做好建立俱乐部的宣传工作，向社员讲解合作化新形势，俱乐部的性质、作用和组织等问题。第二步是结合处理建立高级社和整社、并大社的具体问题而建立筹备委员会和作好各项筹备工作。第三步结合农业生产合作社的选举等工作，正式建立俱乐部和选举领导干部，订出工作计划，建立各种组织和制度，开展活动。这样，一个俱乐部的建立，大约只需10天左右就可以了。
    五，俱乐部内的各种组织应该根据具体情况设立。一般是建立俱乐部管理委员会，下设保管、宣传、编写和检查等股（或组）及剧团和图书室等，吸收党的宣传员参加，每股设若干人，以便分工负责，经常深入生产队和小组开展宣传活动，并利用俱乐部的场所开展经常的群众业余文化活动。
