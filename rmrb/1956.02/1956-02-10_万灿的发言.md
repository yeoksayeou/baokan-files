    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I fully agree with and resolutely support Premier Zhou's report and the reports of all the leading comrades.
    I am a social science researcher and educator. I studied in Germany from 1922 to 1929. I studied a set of economic theories from the Historical School, the New Historical School, and the Vienna School. In my political activities in China over the past 30 years, my guiding ideology has been the Three Principles of the People, the revolutionary Three Principles of the People. In the past, I deeply felt that the theories and professional skills I had learned were contradictory to my political ideas; at the same time, I felt that my political ideas were very distant from Marxism-Leninism. For many years, I felt lost and pained on this contradictory foundation.
    We all know that the theories of the Historical School, the New Historical School, and the Vienna School were produced in Germany and Austria, where capitalism had not yet been established but people were talking emptily about political economy, and where capitalism had been established but people dared not truly study political economy. It is a thorough and utter defense of capitalist economic theories. However, in old China, capitalism had not yet been truly established, and amidst the national liberation upsurge against imperialism and feudalism, and with the emergence of the working class on the Chinese political stage, it had no place to be used at all. Therefore, what I learned had nothing in common with my past political views. I felt pain.
    My past political thought was Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the Three Principles of the People as developed by Deng Yanda. But we all know that the Three Principles of the People is not Marxism; it can only be compatible with the minimum program of a Marxist party. When I discovered that Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries betrayed the revolution, causing the Chinese revolution to fail, and that China's national liberation struggle could only be completed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese working class, and that only Marxism-Leninism was the correct theory of the Chinese revolution, my old political ideas clashed extremely sharply with my new political ideas. I felt even more pain.
    These two kinds of pain entangled me for decades, making me feel lost and pained, pained and frustrated.
    In January 1949, with a cannon shot, the Chinese working class, following the victory of the Soviet working class's October Revolution, finally led the Chinese people to achieve the final revolutionary victory, and recovered our capital, Beijing, which shines brightly and illuminates the whole world today. Subsequently, the whole country was liberated, and the Chinese people stood up. This cannon shot swept away my confusion, pain and frustration along with the people's many heavy burdens. My contradictions were finally resolved.
    Since 1949, I have abandoned the set of useless things I learned in the past, and I no longer teach those things from the garbage heap. I began to teach Marx's political economy. Later, I felt that it was not enough, so I decided to start from scratch, accepting thorough ideological and professional transformation. From 1951 to 1953, I was a student at the Renmin University of China, and I even graduated. Therefore, I was able to basically teach political economy from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism. From then on, I finally abandoned my former standpoint, viewpoint, and method of the Three Principles of the People, and even the revolutionary Three Principles of the People. Today, I want to work with everyone to strive to be a true Marxist, a true red professor, not a professor who is red on the outside but white on the inside, who hangs a sheep's head but sells dog meat, who smuggles in capitalist idealism, but a professor who is consistent in theory, profession, and political ideology.
    Marx said long ago that the economists of the capitalist world, since the death of Adam Smith and Ricardo, no longer dared to explore the truth of political economy, but only made some vulgar and boring defense of platitudes. Now the vulgar economic theories of Germany and Austria are spreading rapidly in the capitalist world. Now scholars in Britain and the United States have cut off the lifeline of the classical school and turned to the "marginal utility theory" for a living. The so-called theories of great scholars such as Keynes are nothing more than subspecies of this theory. The capitalist economists of the whole world have followed the inevitable demise of capitalism and embarked on a dead end.
    In the past, our country has always been a student of Europe and the United States in social sciences, especially in economics. Because there was no real development of capitalism in China, not only was there nothing to talk about in the air, but also nothing to defend. In the past, Chinese intellectuals in this regard, including myself, can be said to have been mediocre throughout their lives and gained nothing. This is not only a shame for Chinese intellectuals, but also a sorrow for Chinese intellectuals. However, this cannot be said for the Chinese working class. Only the Chinese working class can correctly and accurately criticize and oppose the economic theories of the bourgeoisie, and accept Marx's economic theories completely and sincerely. Have we not seen that under the leadership of the Chinese working class, in the past 20 years, especially in recent years, the dissemination of Marxist political economy in China has not only taken root, sprouted, grown, and become increasingly strong and lush? We have now seen that the science of political economy has radiated a strange and colorful light in China today. I can assert that the scientific achievements of China in the future, the first to approach the world level will inevitably be this science.
    Today, researchers of social sciences in China, especially economists, have boundless space for development under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese working class. We will learn to master the laws of development, so that the country's natural scientists and technicians can develop high technology, to seek the increasing growth and improvement of social production, to complete the socialist transformation and socialist construction. Those who, like me in the past, have felt confused and painful, don't you say that you are not yet sober to reflect on your mistakes?
    Since abandoning Adam Smith's and Ricardo's labor theory of value, the bourgeois economists of the whole world have attempted to obliterate and conceal the historical category of "value," and directly interpret "value" as "use value" under the capitalist system, as if the capitalist world is an eternal and immortal human "paradise," as if "full employment" can be expected under the constant crisis. In fact, the bourgeois economists of Europe and the United States, for not producing butter and bread but producing airplanes, cannons, and atomic bombs and other murderous weapons, even if the butter and bread produced are not used as "use value" to supply the people, but rather thrown into the sea when the people cannot afford to buy them, these facts also prove their lies without being attacked and declare their bankruptcy.
    In the past nearly 7 years, under the patient education of the Party, our social scientists and economists have made considerable progress in their professional and political-ideological levels through many movements. Our past social scientists and economists should thoroughly abandon the old and decayed things, because the newborn revolutionary is irresistible. We should unite with intellectuals across the country, march in formation towards the great advance of science! We should respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and guarantee the completion and over-completion of reaching the world's scientific level in less than 12 years!
    I personally express my heartfelt support for the Chinese Communist Party's policy towards intellectuals. As an intellectual like me, although I am already past my middle age, I am willing to sincerely express that I will advance together with the intellectuals of the whole country, contribute all my strength to overcome the fortress of science, and devote my share of strength to complete the socialist construction of our country.

    万灿的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意和坚决拥护周总理的报告和各位首长的报告。
    我是一个社会科学研究者和教育工作者。我过去曾于1922年到1929年在德国留学。我学的是一套历史学派、新历史学派和维也纳学派的经济学说。我过去30年在中国政治的活动中，我的指导思想是三民主义，革命的三民主义。我过去曾深深感到我所学的理论和业务是与我的政治思想有矛盾的；同时也感到我的政治思想是与马克思列宁主义有很大距离的。我长年地在这种矛盾基础上感觉到彷徨和痛苦。
    我们大家都知道历史学派、新历史学派和维也纳学派的学说是在资本主义尚未建立而空谈政治经济学和资本主义既已建立而又不敢真正研究政治经济学的德、奥产生出来的，它是彻首彻尾十足的资本主义辩护经济学说。可是过去在旧中国资本主义既未能真正建立起来，而在整个民族要求反帝、反封建的民族解放怒潮之下，同时在工人阶级业已出现于中国政治舞台之下，它是丝毫没有用武之地的。因此，我所学的与我过去的政治主张没有丝毫共同之点。我感觉到痛苦。
    我过去的政治思想是孙中山先生的三民主义，是邓演达先生发展了的三民主义。但是我们大家都知道三民主义不是马克思主义；它只能与马克思主义政党的最低纲领相适合。当我发见蒋介石反动派叛变革命，使中国革命遭到失败的时候，中国的民族解放斗争只有在中国共产党和中国工人阶级的领导之下才能完成，而只有马克思列宁主义才是中国革命的正确理论的时候，我的旧政治思想又与我的新政治思想发生了极端尖锐的冲突。我更感觉到非常的痛苦。
    以上这两种痛苦纠缠了我几十年，使我彷徨而痛苦，痛苦而懊丧。
    1949年1月，一声炮响，中国工人阶级继苏联工人阶级十月革命胜利之后，而最后地领导了中国人民获得了最后的革命胜利，光复了我们今日光芒万丈照耀了全世界的首都——北京。随之而全国解放，中国人民站了起来了。这一声炮响就使我的彷徨和痛苦懊丧都随着全国人民的重重苦难一扫而光。我的矛盾也终于解决了。
    我自1949年起，即抛弃了我旧日所学的那一套废物，再也不讲授那些垃圾堆里的东西。我开始讲授马克思的政治经济学了。我后来觉得不够，就决心从头学起，接受彻底的思想改造和业务改造。我于1951年到1953年在中国人民大学做了学生，竟也毕了业。我于是就能够基本地以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法来讲授政治经济学了。从此，我也就终于抛弃了我从前三民主义乃至革命三民主义的立场、观点和方法。今日，我得与大家一道争取做个真正的马克思主义者，做个真正的红色教授而不是什么红皮白心、挂羊头卖狗肉的、偷运资本主义唯心主义的教授，要做个在理论上、业务上和政治思想上表里如一的教授。
    马克思早已说过，资本主义世界的经济学者们，自从亚当斯密和李嘉图死后，就再也没有人敢于探讨政治经济的真相，只是作了些庸俗的无聊的辩护滥调而已。现在德奥的庸俗经济学说在资本主义世界得以不胫而走。现在英美的学者竟自斩断了古典学派的龙脉，反转过来向“边际效用学说”讨生活。所谓大学者们如凯因期之流的所谓学说，都不过是这个学说的亚种。全世界的资本主义经济学者们已经随着资本主义不可避免的灭亡而走上了死路一条。
    我国过去在社会科学方面，尤其是在经济学方面，始终是欧美的学生。因为在中国没有资本主义的真正发展，不独所谈空中无物，抑且辩护无物。过去中国知识分子在这方面，包括我个人在内，可以说碌碌终生，毫无所得。这不独是中国知识分子的耻辱，也是中国知识分子的悲哀。然而，对于中国工人阶级来说，却不能这样说。唯有中国工人阶级才能正确无误地批判地反对资产阶级的经济理论，完全诚心诚意地接受马克思的经济理论。我们难道还不曾看见在中国工人阶级领导之下，近20年来，尤其是近几年来，马克思主义的政治经济学在中国的传播，不独生根、发芽、成长并且日益壮大、茂盛吗？我们现在已经看见了政治经济学这门科学在中国今日已经放了奇光异彩。我可以断言未来的中国科学的成就，最先接近于世界水平的将必然是这门科学。
    今日中国社会科学的研究者，尤其是经济学者，在中国共产党和中国工人阶级的领导之下，有无穷发展的场所。我们将学会掌握发展规律，使全国的自然科学者、技术人员发展高度的技术，来求社会生产的日益增长与完善，来完成社会主义的改造和社会主义的建设。与我过去一样曾经彷徨感觉到痛苦的人们，难道说现在还不清醒反省自己的错误吗？
    全世界的资产阶级经济学者，自从抛弃了亚当斯密和李嘉图的劳动价值学说之后，企图抹煞和掩蔽历史范畴的“价值”，竟在资本主义制度下直接解释“价值”为“使用价值”，似乎资本主义世界是永恒不朽的人类“天堂”，似乎在危机不绝之下，竟可望于“全面就业”。其实，欧美的资产阶级的经济学者先生们，对于不生产牛油面包而生产飞机大炮原子弹等杀人利器，即令是所生产的牛油面包也不是当作“使用价值”来供给人民使用，而当人民买不起的时候，宁可投于海中的这些事实，也就不攻自破地证明了自己的谎言，宣布了自己的破产。
    我国的社会科学者、经济学者，将近7年来在党的耐心教育下，通过许多运动，业已在业务和政治思想水平上有了相当的提高。我们过去的社会科学者和经济学者们应该彻底抛弃过去的陈腐东西，因为新生的革命的是不可抗拒的。我们应该与全国知识分子团结在一起，步伐整齐地向科学大进军！我们应该响应毛主席和中国共产党的号召，保证完成和超额完成不到12年就要达到世界上的科学水平！
    我个人特别衷心地表示拥护中国共产党对待知识分子的政策。像我这样一个知识分子，虽然年已早过半百，但是我愿意诚心诚意地表示我将同全国知识分子一道前进，贡献我的一切力量来克服科学的堡垒，来致力我一分子的力量，完成我国的社会主义的建设。
