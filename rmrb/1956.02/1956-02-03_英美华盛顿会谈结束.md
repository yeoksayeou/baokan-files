Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd, Washington dispatch: The talks between British Prime Minister Eden and U.S. President Eisenhower, which began on January 30, concluded on February 1. The two sides issued a communiqué and a joint declaration on the talks.

In the "Joint Declaration," the heads of government of the United States and Britain reiterated their "common goal" of continuing to pursue a "policy of strength" and piecing together aggressive military blocs. In view of the unfavorable reactions caused by this policy in Asian and African countries, the declaration proposes to help "backward countries" through economic "aid" programs, and openly intimidates those countries that are prepared to cooperate economically with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Considering the pressure of world opinion, the "Joint Declaration" also expressed its willingness to promote "negotiations and reconciliation" instead of "resolving" differences between East and West "by force."

According to Western newspapers, this "Joint Declaration," which emphasizes Anglo-American "unity," cannot conceal the actual situation of the talks. The outcome of the talks confirmed the Western press's prediction that the United States and Britain could not make specific decisions on substantive issues of mutual interest. New York newspapers said that during the talks, Britain attempted to obtain concessions from the United States on several issues, but the United States tried its best to exert pressure on Britain, urging it to "more strongly" support current U.S. policies.

Reuters reported on February 1 that after the talks, the United States and Britain "did not announce policy decisions on critical Middle East and Far East issues." American newspapers pointed out that the United States and Britain encountered the sharpest differences when discussing Middle East issues. "New York Times" reporter Baldwin said that the root of these differences was Anglo-American competition in oil. Many Western newspaper commentators mentioned that the joint communiqué only vaguely mentioned the hope of resolving the disputes between Israel and the Arabs without proposing any solutions. Regarding the Baghdad Pact, which Britain attaches great importance to, the United States only stated that it would "continue to support the purpose and objectives of this treaty." On the issue of the dispute between Britain and Saudi Arabia over the Buraimi Oasis, Agence France-Presse reported that discussions "reached a stalemate" because the United States refused to support Britain.

On the Far East situation, the Anglo-American joint communiqué stated that the two countries' objective is to "deter and prevent aggressive expansion through force and subversive activities, and to assist the free countries in the region to implement self-defense and maintain domestic stability and welfare." The communiqué attempts to use this statement to conceal the aggressive activities carried out by the United States in the Asian region and the measures taken by the United States and Britain to suppress the national liberation movements in Asia. However, after explaining this "common purpose," the communiqué added: "After frank discussions, some differences remain in our judgments regarding the most effective ways to achieve these goals."

The communiqué said that "trade controls (i.e., the illegal trade 'embargo' against China) should continue." It also said: These "controls" "should be reviewed in scope now and periodically in accordance with changing circumstances."

According to American newspaper reports, when discussing policy toward China, Britain, under pressure from the United States, abandoned its demand to discuss the issue of restoring the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

The Anglo-American joint communiqué also stated that it would continue to give the Manila Treaty Organization "full support." A "New York Herald Tribune" reporter pointed out that during the discussion of this issue, differences were also expressed between the United States and Britain, with the United States wanting Britain to more actively support this aggressive military bloc.

Some newspapers in Paris pointed out that Bulganin's proposal to Eisenhower to conclude a Soviet-American treaty of friendship and cooperation, as well as Premier Zhou Enlai's recent concrete proposals on easing tensions in the Far East, had a great impact on the Anglo-American talks. Paris' "Croix" believes that they "dominated the talks between Eisenhower and Eden."

    英美华盛顿会谈结束
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：1月30日开始的英国首相艾登同美国总统艾森豪威尔之间的会谈已经在2月1日结束。双方在会谈后发表了关于会谈情况的公报和一项联合宣言。
    美英两国政府首脑在“联合宣言”中重申他们的“共同目标”是继续奉行“实力政策”和拼凑侵略性的军事集团。鉴于这种政策在亚非国家中引起的不利反响，宣言提出要通过经济“援助”计划来帮助“落后国家”，并且对那些准备同苏联和人民民主国家在经济上进行合作的国家公然施以恫吓。考虑到世界舆论的压力，“联合宣言”还表示愿意促进“谈判和和解”，而不“用武力来解决”东西方之间的分歧。
    据西方报纸指出：这个强调英美“一致”的“联合宣言”并不能掩饰会谈的实际情况。这次会谈的结果证实了西方报界的预测：美英两国在它们利害相关的实质问题上不能作出具体决定。纽约的报纸说，在会谈过程中，英国企图在若干问题上取得美国的让步，但是美国却竭力对英国施加压力，要它“更有力地”支持美国现行的政策。
    路透社1日消息说，会谈结束后，美英双方“没有宣布对紧要的中东和远东问题作出政策决定”。美国报纸指出，美英两国在讨论中东问题时碰到最尖锐的分歧。“纽约时报”记者鲍德温说，这些分歧的根源是英美在石油方面的竞争。许多西方报纸的评论员都提到，在会谈公报中，仅仅空洞地谈到希望解决以色列和阿拉伯之间的纠纷，没有提出任何解决方案；对于英国极其重视的巴格达条约，美国仅仅表示将“继续对这个条约的宗旨和目标”给以支持。在英国和沙特阿拉伯关于布赖米绿洲的争执问题上，据法新社消息说，由于美国拒绝支持英国而使讨论“陷于僵局”。
    在远东局势问题上，英美联合公报说：两国的目的是“阻遏和防止通过武力和颠复活动进行的侵略性扩张，协助这个地区的自由国家实行自卫和维持国内稳定和福利”。公报企图用这种说法来掩饰美国在亚洲地区所进行的侵略活动和美英两国镇压亚洲民族解放运动的措施。但是公报在说明这种“共同目的”以后又说：“经过坦白的讨论以后，在实现这些目的的最有效的办法方面，我们的判断还存在一些分歧。”
    公报说，“贸易管制（即对中国实行的非法的贸易‘禁运’）应该继续”。它又说：这种“管制”“应该在现在和定期地按照不断变化的局势就其范围加以审查”。
    据美国报纸消息，在讨论对中国的政策时，英国在美国的压力下放弃了讨论关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位的问题的要求。
    英美联合公报还表示将继续给马尼拉条约集团“以充分支持”。“纽约先驱论坛报”记者指出，在讨论这个问题时，美英之间也表现了分歧，美国要英国更积极地支持这个侵略性的军事集团。
    巴黎的一些报纸指出，布尔加宁向艾森豪威尔提出的缔结苏美友好合作条约的建议以及周恩来总理最近提出的关于和缓远东紧张局势的具体建议对美英两国会谈产生很大的影响。巴黎“十字架晚报”认为，它们“支配着艾森豪威尔和艾登的会谈”。
