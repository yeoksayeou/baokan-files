    Conserving Steel
    The Ministry of Heavy Industry has already begun producing ribbed steel bars this year. Using this type of steel bar in construction can save 20% to 30% of steel compared to using round steel. The Ministry of Heavy Industry is also accelerating the trial production of new types of cement, such as No. 700 cement, to meet the needs of using high-efficiency steel bars. The Building Engineering Department's Research Institute has also successfully trial-produced cold-drawn steel bars. After key trials at construction sites such as the North China Datong General Company, it has been proven that steel can be saved by 20% to 30%. The Railway Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways is experimenting with pre-stressed steel, which can reduce the use of steel by 20% to 80%.
    Given the current shortage of steel in our country, it is very important to strive to adopt new technologies and save steel in capital construction. All capital construction departments and scientific departments should extensively study, learn, and promote advanced experiences in this area.

    节约钢材
    重工业部今年已经开始生产螺纹钢筋，用这种钢筋进行建筑，比用圆钢可以节约钢材20％到30％。重工业部还正在加速试制700号水泥等新品种水泥，以适应使用高效能钢筋的需要。建筑工程部技术研究所对钢筋冷拉也已经试制成功，经过华北大同总公司等工地重点试用，证明可以节约钢材20％到30％。铁道部铁道研究所正在试验研究钢材预加应力，这样可以少用20％到80％的钢材。
    在我国目前钢材不充足的情况下，努力采用新技术，在基本建设中节约钢材，是非常重要的。各个基本建设部门和科学部门应该广泛地研究、学习和推广这方面的先进经验。
