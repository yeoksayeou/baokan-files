    The Future "Thousand Catty Province"
    ——A Sideline Account of the Anhui Province Socialist Construction Activists Conference——
    By Our Reporter Yu Ming
    The disaster-prone Anhui Province is about to become the granary of the motherland! Recently, more than 4,000 socialist construction activists from Anhui Province gathered to discuss the draft Program for Agricultural Development proposed by the Party Central Committee, and the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's provincial agricultural development plan based on this draft program. Everyone saw a bright future.

    According to the requirements of Anhui Province's agricultural development plan, in 12 years, the average yield of grain per mu in the province will be increased from the current 200 catties to 600 catties in the Huaibei Plain, from the current 280 catties to 800 catties in the Huainan hilly area, from the current 600 catties to 1,400 catties on both sides of the Yangtze River, and to 900 catties in the mountainous area of southern Anhui. The grain produced by farmers in one year will be enough to eat for two years. Ordinary floods, droughts, and local diseases will also be eliminated throughout the province. Illiteracy will be completely eliminated, and some people can also receive secondary education. 2,000 power stations will be established throughout the province, the countryside will be initially electrified, every township will have electric lights, and every cooperative will have telephones. Agricultural cooperatives will have clubs and sports fields. The people of Anhui will live a happy and prosperous life.

    When discussing this plan, all socialist construction activists in the province believed that it would gradually become a reality. Because they remember how many things the Communist Party has led the farmers to do since liberation that predecessors could not do! In 1955, the province's grain output had increased to two and a half times that of the early days of liberation, exceeding the output stipulated in the country's first five-year plan for the final year. This was achieved even in the face of continuous disasters. And the average yield required to be achieved in the next 12 years is only two to three times the current yield, but the conditions are very different. Now, the vast majority of farmers in the province have joined agricultural production cooperatives; the "three reforms" measures adapted to Anhui's characteristics have played a significant role in disaster avoidance and yield preservation; coupled with the support of the national industry, can we not create greater achievements? After discussing these conditions, the confidence of each socialist construction activist in realizing this plan was even greater.

    Many socialist construction activists introduced their experiences in obtaining increased production, which powerfully proved that the current plan can definitely be broken through. Elderly farmer Zhang Huiting is the director of the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yingshang County, along the Huai River. The land of the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative is low-lying and often suffers from floods. It is so-called "dog-shit" land. In the early days of liberation, the average yield per mu was 80 to 90 catties. In 1953, after Zhang Huiting led the farmers to organize the agricultural production cooperative, they only did more processing and more fertilization on the land to achieve the purpose of increasing production, with an average yield of 216 catties per mu. In 1955, the Xinmin Cooperative implemented various planting methods according to the nature of the land. 180 mu of land implemented four crops and three harvests. The first crop of wheat implemented two ridges close together, intercropping sorghum (or corn) in the wheat field. After pulling up the wheat, sufficient fertilizer was applied, and sesame (or indigo) was sown in the sorghum field. When the sesame grew taller, buckwheat was plowed in. Wheat, sorghum, and buckwheat yielded a total of 350 catties per mu, and a season of green manure fertilized the field. Another 160 mu of land implemented intercropping of wheat, sorghum, soybeans, and corn, four crops and four harvests, resulting in an average yield of 410 catties per mu. Another 80 mu of land was the first to implement dry land converted to paddy fields. In the complete absence of experience, rice and wheat were grown in rotation, with an average yield of 550 catties of grain per mu. Another type of land implemented sweet potato and turnip rotation, with sweet potatoes alone yielding more than 1,000 catties per mu. In 1955, the land of this cooperative yielded an average of more than 330 catties of grain per mu, four times the average yield per mu in the early days of liberation.

    After the Xinmin Cooperative obtained a good harvest, the vast majority of members reflected, "There is grain to be distributed all year round." However, some members worried about the depletion of soil fertility and that crops would not grow next year. But someone immediately disagreed, saying, "Don't be afraid of soil depletion, as long as you plow more, harrow more, and apply more manure, you will definitely be able to increase soil fertility and grow more grain." The Xinmin Cooperative did this, and fully utilized the other favorable conditions after the transition to a higher-level cooperative. This year's wheat is also growing very well, and the cooperative's grain output this year will be increased to an average of 600 catties per mu, reaching the province's planned grain output target for the Huaibei region in 1967.

    The grain output of this agricultural cooperative is not the highest output in the Huaibei region, and many are higher than them. Some have reached seven or eight hundred catties per mu, and some have reached more than 1,000 catties. For example, the rice replanted last year by the Sha Huai First Agricultural Cooperative in Yingshang County averaged more than 1,100 catties per mu. However, the current average grain output in Huaibei is only 200 catties per mu. Everyone believes that these agricultural cooperatives, as long as they improve farming techniques and tap production potential like the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative, will definitely make agricultural production in the Huaibei region increase faster.

    Socialist construction activists from both sides of the Yangtze River also introduced many experiences of changing single-season rice to double-season rice, changing two crops a year to three consecutive crops, changing dry land to paddy fields, and changing low-yield crops to high-yield crops. These experiences were also gained in the continuous opposition to right-leaning conservative thought. For example, some people once believed that double-season rice could not be replanted in Anhui Province. Even after someone successfully replanted double-season rice in the south of the Yangtze River and obtained increased production, some people still said, "The south can do it, but the north can't!" However, the facts of 1955 broke the conservative thinking of these people: not only did the double-season rice replanted in the south and north of the Yangtze River obtain increased production, but also the double-season rice replanted in Xujiagang, Huaibei, harvested a total of seven or eight hundred catties of early and late rice per mu. This year, the province had more than 800,000 mu of double-season rice, with an average yield of about 250 catties more per mu than single-season rice. At this socialist construction activists conference, everyone was very enthusiastic about expanding the planting area of double-season rice and other "three reforms" measures this year. After Wuhu County mastered the experience of planting double-season rice and three consecutive crops in 1955, the county's land utilization area this year will reach more than twice the cultivated area, and the average grain output will be increased from 690 catties per mu in 1955 to more than 1,000 catties.

    After exchanging experiences, all the activists found that the potential for agricultural production increase is very large. In the Huaibei region, if the current single-season wheat is changed to two seasons of wheat and rice, and the low-yield crop sorghum is changed to the high-yield crop corn, the average grain output per mu can be increased by one to two or three times. In the Huainan hilly area, as long as water conservancy conditions are improved, not only can a single-season rice crop be guaranteed, but the farming system can also be changed to two dry crops and one water crop (rapeseed, rice, corn), and the output per unit area will be greatly increased. On both sides of the Yangtze River, tens of millions of mu of land now only have a few areas planted with double-season rice. If all are replanted with double-season rice in the future, the output per unit area there will be the highest. In addition, Anhui's experience in implementing the "three reforms" in the past three years has also proved that replanting Victory Hundred Sweet Potatoes yields twice as much as replanting local sweet potatoes, but the area of land replanted is still less than one-third; if all are replanted, grain output can also be greatly increased.

    After exchanging experiences and discussing methods of increasing production, the activists all expressed that they would lead the broad masses to continue to overcome conservative thinking, first break through this year's grain production targets, and then strive to break through the provincial party committee's planned production targets for 1967. At that time, Anhui Province will become a "Thousand Catty Province."

    未来的“千斤省”
    ——安徽省社会主义建设积极分子大会旁听记——
    本报记者　于明
    多灾的安徽省，快要变成祖国的粮仓了！最近，安徽省4，000多个社会主义建设积极分子，集会讨论了党中央提出的农业发展纲要草案，和中共安徽省委根据这一纲要草案提出的全省农业发展规划，每个人都看清了未来的美好的前途。
    按照安徽省的农业发展规划要求，12年后，全省粮食每亩平均产量，在淮北平原地区，将由现在的200斤提高到600斤，淮南丘陵地区将由现在的280斤提高到800斤，长江两岸将由现在的600斤提高到1，400斤，皖南山区将提高到900斤。农民一年生产的粮食够两年吃。全省普通的水旱灾害和地方疾病也都消灭。文盲完全扫除，一部分人还可以受到中等教育。全省建立起2，000个发电站，农村初步电气化，乡乡有电灯，社社都通电话。农业合作社都有俱乐部、运动场。安徽人民将过着幸福富裕的生活。
    全省社会主义建设积极分子，在讨论这一规划时，都相信它会逐步变成现实。因为他们记得，解放后，共产党领导农民已经作出了多少前人所不能作的事情啊！1955年，全省的粮食产量已提高到刚解放时的二倍半，超过了国家第一个五年计划规定的最后一年的产量。这而且是在连年遭灾的情况下获得的。而在今后的12年内要求达到的平均产量，仅仅是现在产量的二倍到三倍，但是条件却已大大地不同。现在全省绝大多数农民参加了农业生产合作社；适应安徽特点的“三改”办法，已经对避灾保收发生了重大作用；再加上国家工业的支援，难道不能创造更大的成绩吗？在讨论这些条件以后，每个社会主义建设积极分子对实现这一规划的信心就更大了。
    许多社会主义建设积极分子，介绍了他们获得增产的经验，有力地证明了现在的规划是一定能够突破的。老年农民张会亭，是淮河沿岸颍上县新民农业生产合作社的社长。新民农业合作社的土地地势低洼，常遭涝灾，是所谓“狗不拉屎”的土地，解放初期，每亩产量平均八、九十斤。1953年，张会亭领导农民组织农业生产合作社后，只在土地上多加工、多施肥，就达到了增产的目的，每亩平均产量216斤。1955年，新民合作社按照土地性质，实行了各种不同的种植方法。有180亩地实行四种三收，第一季麦子实行二垅靠，在麦地里套种高粱（或玉米），拔麦后施足肥，又在高粱地里撒种芝麻（或蓝靛），等到芝麻长高了的时候，就犁掉种荞麦。麦子、高粱、荞麦每亩合共收了350斤，还有一季绿肥肥了田。还有160亩地，实行麦子、高粱、黄豆、玉米套种，四种四收，结果每亩平均收410斤。还有80亩地是第一次实行旱田改水田，在完全没有经验的情况下，实行稻、麦连作，每亩还平均收550斤粮食。另一种地实行红芋、葫萝卜连作，光是红芋每亩收1，000多斤。1955年，这个合作社的土地每亩平均收粮食330多斤，为刚解放时每亩平均产量的四倍。
    在新民合作社得到好收成后，绝大多数社员反映：“一年到头都有粮食分。”也有部分社员却顾虑地力耗尽，来年不长庄稼。但马上有人不同意，说：“不怕地力耗尽，只要多犁多耙多上粪，就一定能够增加地力，多打粮食。”新民合作社照这样办了，并且充分利用了转高级社后的其他有利条件，今年的麦子又长得很好，全社今年的粮食产量将提高到每亩平均600斤，达到全省规划的1967年的淮北地区的粮食产量指标。
    这个农业合作社的粮食产量，并不是淮北地区的最高产量，比他们高的还很多。有的每亩产量已经达到七、八百斤，有的达到了1，000斤以上。如颍上县沙淮第一农业合作社去年改种的水稻，有一部分每亩平均收了1，100多斤。可是，现在淮北的粮食平均产量每亩才200斤。大家认为，这些地方的农业合作社，只要像新民农业合作社那样，改进耕作技术，挖掘生产潜力，就一定会使淮北地区的农业生产提高得更快。
    来自长江两岸的社会主义建设积极分子，还介绍了许多一季稻改双季稻，一年两季改三季连作，旱田改水田，低产作物改种高产作物的经验。这些经验也是在不断地反对右倾保守思想中获得的。例如，曾经有人认为安徽省就不能改种双季稻。甚至有人在长江以南试种双季稻成功，获得增产以后，也还有人说：“江南可以，江北可是不行！”可是1955年的事实打破了这些人的保守思想：不但江南、江北改种的双季稻得到增产，就是在淮北徐家港试种的双季稻，每亩早、晚稻合计收了七、八百斤。这一年，全省有80多万亩双季稻，每亩平均比单季稻多收250斤左右。在这次社会主义建设积极分子大会上，大家对今年扩大双季稻种植面积等“三改”措施的积极性很高。芜湖县在1955年掌握了种双季稻和三季连作等经验后，今年全县的土地利用面积将达到耕地面积的二倍多，粮食平均产量将由1955年的每亩690斤提高到1，000多斤。
    全体积极分子在交流经验后，发现农业增产的潜力是很大的。淮北地区，如果把现在种一季小麦改为麦、稻两季，把低产作物高粱改种高产作物玉米，每亩地的粮食平均产量就可以提高一倍到两三倍。淮南丘陵地区，只要改进水利条件，不但能使一季水稻保收，还可以把耕作制度改为两旱一水（油菜、水稻、玉米），单位面积产量将大大提高。长江两岸的上千万亩土地，现在只有少数地区种了双季稻，如果以后都改种双季稻，那里的单位面积产量将是最高的。此外，安徽最近3年来实行“三改”的经验还证明，改种胜利百号山芋比种土山芋能增产一倍，可是现在改种的土地还不到三分之一；如果全部改种，也可以使粮食产量大大提高。
    积极分子们在交流经验和讨论了增产办法以后，都表示要带动广大群众继续克服保守思想，首先突破今年的粮食生产指标，然后再争取突破省委规划的1967年的生产指标，那时，安徽全省将成为“千斤省”。
