    The handicraft sector will produce 200,000 double-wheel double-share plows for farmers this year for the first time. The national handicraft sector's double-wheel double-share plow production professional conference, which closed in Beijing on February 1, specifically studied and deployed the production of double-wheel double-share plows with the help of relevant central industrial departments. The conference decided that seven cities—Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Weifang, and Qingdao—should each organize a relatively large handicraft production cooperative with relatively complete equipment to undertake the production of this batch of double-wheel double-share plows. These cooperatives have a total of more than 2,100 craftsmen. After preparations and small-batch trial production in February, March, and April, each cooperative will successively start mass production in the upper and middle ten days of May.
