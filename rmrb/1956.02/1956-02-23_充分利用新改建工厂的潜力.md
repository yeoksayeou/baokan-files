    Fully Utilize the Potential of Newly Rebuilt and Expanded Factories
    By our correspondent Jin Yukun
    The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory is a modern factory rebuilt with comprehensive assistance from the Soviet Union. It mass-produces various pneumatic tools used for developing mines, constructing water conservancy projects, opening mountains and building roads, and constructing railway bridges and factories. After the factory was officially put into production in January 1955, it basically mastered new equipment and technologies in just one year, reaching and exceeding the production level planned for 1957. Originally, it planned to produce 13 new products, but now it has successfully trial-produced and mass-produced 15 new products. The factory's output this year will be more than 50% higher than the level originally planned for 1957. Recently, the factory decided to complete the total output value target set by the first Five-Year Plan 15 months ahead of schedule.
    There are many favorable objective conditions for the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory to quickly master new technologies: the factory was designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union; 80% of the equipment was supplied by the Soviet Union, some of which is even better than that of existing pneumatic tool factories in the Soviet Union; and from the beginning of the factory's construction, Soviet experts have been stationed in the factory for a long time to guide and train technical management cadres.
    Subjectively speaking, the factory's leaders have given play to their initiative. At the beginning of 1955, the higher authorities, based on the ordering needs of other departments, set relatively low planned targets for the factory. However, when the factory's leaders formulated the plan for the third quarter of 1955, they studied the production situation in the second quarter and found that production efficiency had greatly improved due to the increased proficiency in technology and technological improvements. For example, it took 55 working hours to manufacture a heavy rock drill in the first quarter, but only 39 working hours in the second quarter. If the task is not increased, one-third of the production capacity would be wasted. At the same time, other departments also increased the number of orders placed. Therefore, based on this situation, the factory requested the higher leading authorities to increase the task by 94% compared with the plan at the beginning of the year. After the higher authorities agreed, they increased the planned targets every month and every quarter.
    The factory's leading staff constantly measured and spurred themselves on with advanced Soviet indicators. They believe that the indicators must be advanced, the tasks must be fully loaded, and only by doing so can they be motivated to push the enterprise forward continuously and keep workers and cadres in high spirits. For example, when the manufacturing time of a heavy rock drill was reduced from 55 working hours to 46 working hours, the workshop leaders became complacent, which hindered the continued reduction of working hours. The factory leaders compared it with the indicators of the Leningrad Pneumatic Tool Factory, which only took 17 working hours to manufacture the same product. This helped the workshop leaders to soberly view their achievements and shortcomings, and thus actively look for the potential of the enterprise, gradually reducing the working hours from 46 hours to 27 hours, which is closer to the Soviet indicators. Because the factory has always insisted on using advanced indicators, it has comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan every month since April last year.
    The factory also actively learned the latest Soviet technological achievements to accelerate the speed of production development. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, they learned the assembly line production method recently adopted by the Leningrad Pneumatic Tool Factory, and started to organize two assembly lines, and prepared to organize a third assembly line. After the first assembly line was organized, the monthly output of medium-sized hand-held rock drills increased from 500 to more than 1,000. After the second assembly line was organized, the average daily output of pistons (the main parts of pneumatic tools) increased from 165 to 270. In addition, they also learned more than a dozen Soviet high-speed cutting experiences, which increased the efficiency of machine tools by more than two times.
    The work of trial-producing new products directly affects the speed of production development. The entire factory invested two-thirds of its technical strength in this work, and dedicated technical personnel were responsible for the trial production of each new product. The deputy director of technology led them to conduct research in the trial production section every day, held inspection meetings every week, discovered problems in time, and overcame weaknesses in time. The factory established a production preparation room for new product trial production to strengthen preparation work and timely dispatch and organize labor. Coupled with the specific help of Soviet experts, the original plan to trial-produce 3 new products in 1955 was actually completed with 7 types. While the factory was being rebuilt, it began to trial-produce new products, and successfully trial-produced 9 new products before officially putting them into production. This also played a certain role in accelerating the mastery of new technologies.
    One of the decisive factors in quickly mastering new technologies is to improve the technical level of employees. In order to improve the technical level of employees, under the instructions of the higher-level economic leading organs, the factory strived to organize employees to study technology in quality remedial lessons. For example, a special technical study committee was established, and two hours were set aside every day in the first half of 1955 for formal technical study. The first stage mainly studied the basic knowledge of machine tool performance, maintenance, and adjustment, and the second stage studied cutting principles, process regulations, and process equipment. In the past, workers were not proficient in the automatic feed of Soviet-style milling machines, and could only rotate 950 revolutions per minute. After learning, they could increase to 1,500 revolutions. Many special equipment that workers could not use before have also been put into operation. The scrap rate also dropped from 10% to 1%. Within a year, the average technical level of workers increased from level 2.4 to level 3.3.
    Of course, the factory's current variety of products still needs to be expanded, the trial production cycle of new varieties still needs to be accelerated, and some varieties still need to be further improved to meet the needs of users. However, the experience of this factory tells us that for factories newly built or rebuilt with the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, although we have little experience and a low technical level, as long as we make full use of all favorable conditions and strengthen our subjective efforts, it is entirely possible for us to master new technologies at a faster speed and quickly reach and exceed the production level originally planned.

    充分利用新改建工厂的潜力
    本报记者　金雨困
    沈阳风动工具厂是在苏联全面帮助下改建成功的一座现代化工厂。它大量制造用来开发矿山、兴修水利、开山筑路、建设铁路桥梁和厂房的各种风动工具。这个厂在1955年1月正式投入生产后，只一年的时间就基本上掌握了新设备新技术，达到并且超过了计划在1957年才达到的产量水平。原计划生产新产品13种，现在试制成功并且大量生产的新产品已经有15种。这个工厂今年的产量将较原来计划在1957年所达到的水平还高50％以上。最近，这个厂决定提早15个月完成第一个五年计划规定的总产值任务。
    沈阳风动工具厂所以能够很快地掌握新技术，有很多有利的客观条件：工厂是苏联帮助设计的；有80％的设备是苏联供应的，其中有的设备甚至比苏联现有的风动工具厂的还要好；从建厂开始，就有苏联专家长期驻厂指导和培养技术管理干部。
    从主观方面来说，这个工厂的领导人员发挥了主动性。1955年年初，上级机关根据其他部门的订货需要，给这个厂规定的计划指标是比较低的。但是，工厂的领导人员在制定1955年第三季度计划的时候，研究了第二季度生产情况，发现由于技术熟练程度提高和技术的改进，生产效率已经大大提高。如制造一台重型凿岩机，第一季度需55台时，第二季度只要39台时。如果不增加任务，三分之一的生产能力就会浪费掉。同时，其他部门这时提出的订货数量也增加了。于是，工厂就根据这个情况向上级领导机关要求较年初计划增加94％的任务。上级同意以后，他们就每月每季都提高了计划指标。
    工厂的领导工作人员不断地以苏联先进指标来衡量和鞭策自己。他们认为指标一定要先进，任务压得满满的，干起来才有劲头，才能推动企业不断前进，使工人和干部保持饱满的情绪。如制造一部重型凿岩机由55台时降到46台时的时候，车间领导人员就自满起来，阻碍了工时的继续降低。工厂领导就以列宁格勒风动工具厂的指标来比较，人家制造同样的产品只需17台时。这就帮助车间领导人员清醒地看待自己的成绩和缺点，因而积极去寻找企业的潜力，逐步地使台时由46小时降到27小时，更加接近了苏联的指标。由于工厂始终坚持采用先进的指标，从去年4月以来月月全面超额完成了国家计划。
    这个工厂还主动地学习苏联最新的技术成就来加快生产发展的速度。在苏联专家的指导下，他们学习了不久前列宁格勒风动工具厂采用的流水线生产方法，着手组织了两条流水线，并且准备组织第三条流水线。组织了第一条流水线生产以后，中型手提凿岩机的月产量就由500台提高到1，000多台。组织了第二条流水线生产以后，活塞（风动工具中的主要部件）的平均日产量由165个提高到270个。此外，他们又学习了苏联十多种高速切削经验，使机床的效率提高二倍以上。
    直接影响提高工厂生产发展速度的是新产品试制工作。全厂以三分之二的技术力量投入了这个工作，每种新产品的试制都有专责的技术人员负责，技术副厂长每天领导他们深入到试制工段进行研究，每周召开检查会议，及时发现问题，及时克服薄弱环节。工厂建立了新产品试制的生产准备室，加强准备工作，及时调度和组织劳动力。再加上苏联专家的具体帮助，1955年原计划试制3种新产品，实际完成7种。这个工厂在改建的同时，就着手试制新产品，在正式投入生产前就试制成功9种新产品。这对加速掌握新技术也有一定作用。
    迅速掌握新技术的决定因素之一是提高职工的技术水平。为了提高职工的技术水平，工厂在上级经济领导机关的指示下，在质量补课中努力组织职工学习技术。如建立了专门的技术学习委员会，在1955年上半年每天抽出两小时进行正规的技术学习。第一阶段主要学习机床性能、保养和调整的基本知识，第二阶段学习切削原理、工艺规程和工艺装备。苏式铣床的自动走刀，过去工人不熟练，每分钟只能转950转，学习后可提高到1，500转。许多原来不会使用的特殊设备，工人也都开动起来了。废品率也由10％降到1％。在一年内，工人的平均技术等级由2.4级提高到3.3级。
    当然，这个厂目前的品种还需要扩大，新品种试制周期还需要加快，有些品种还需要进一步改进，才能满足用户的需要。但是，这个厂的经验告诉我们，苏联全面帮助我们新建或改建的工厂，虽然我们的经验很少，技术水平很低，但是，只要我们充分利用一切有利的条件，加强我们的主观努力，就完全有可能以更快的速度来掌握新技术，迅速地达到和超过原来计划达到的生产水平。
