Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

	I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and agree with the important reports of Vice-Chairman Li Jishen, Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman Dong Biwu, and Committee Member Chen Boda. I am also willing to implement them with my greatest effort.

	In the more than six years since liberation, under the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have achieved a series of victories in various social reforms and socialist construction undertakings. In just six short years, we have greatly changed the backward face left over from old China. At present, the upsurge of socialist transformation of agriculture is flourishing throughout the country, and the upsurge of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicraft cooperation has followed in large, medium, and small cities across the country. The people's living standards are constantly improving, and the people across the country are jubilant everywhere, singing the praises of the superiority of the people's regime. This is truly a series of happy events, making everyone feel proud to live in the new China of the Mao Zedong era.

	Regarding the issue of intellectuals, Chairman Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report that in order to complete the task of socialist transformation as soon as possible, "we must not only rely on the creative labor of the working class and the broad masses of peasants, but also fully mobilize and give play to the strength of the intellectuals in our country." Although intellectuals in our country have made significant contributions to the country in past work, the fact proves that the enthusiasm and socialist consciousness of the working class and peasants have already run ahead, while the level of awareness and professional level of intellectuals are far behind the objective reality. Therefore, further improving the existing intellectuals and cultivating a large number of new forces has become an urgent task.

	I participate in the leadership work of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. In the practice of these years of work, I deeply realize the correctness of the three paths of transformation of intellectuals pointed out by Chairman Zhou Enlai in his report, especially the effect of "observing and practicing social life" is the greatest. Not long ago, when I participated in the opening ceremony of the Guangyuan-Lueyang section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, I saw the workers overcome the Bashan and Qinling Mountains in the excavation and embankment areas, making the Shu Road, which the ancients called "harder than ascending to heaven," safely passable by train today. The workers' brave spirit of selfless labor for the cause of socialist construction greatly moved me, and I felt that my personal strength was too small and that I had done too little. Last autumn, when I inspected agricultural cooperation in the Shangluo Mountainous Area of Shaanxi, I saw the mountainous area peasants responding to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, enthusiastically participating in agricultural production cooperatives, and surging forward towards the socialist road of common prosperity and happiness, which greatly encouraged me and gave me a profound education. Therefore, I believe that going deep into the worker-peasant masses and learning from the masses is the most effective method for the ideological transformation of intellectuals.

	In the future, I will continue to further study Marxism-Leninism, combine it with ideological reality and work reality, vigorously carry out self-education and self-transformation, and help and learn from the masses I am connected with, and contribute all my strength to the socialist construction cause under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

	Regarding the issue of liberating Taiwan, Chairman Zhou Enlai has solemnly pointed out in his report: "In addition to liberating Taiwan by war, there is also the possibility of liberating Taiwan by peaceful means. In this way, the people of our mainland and the people of Taiwan have a common patriotic responsibility, which is to actively prepare to liberate Taiwan by war when necessary, and to strive to liberate Taiwan by peaceful means." Chairman Zhou Enlai's report clearly pointed out the two ways for us to liberate Taiwan. Here, I sincerely advise some of my acquaintances who have fled to Taiwan that you should wake up. Now is the time to choose your correct path. If you continue to follow American imperialism, you will only end up in a dead end. If you can come to your senses and liberate Taiwan through peaceful means, so that the compatriots in Taiwan can return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, you will surely be forgiven by the people of the motherland. This is the only correct and bright path you should take.

	In addition to sincerely supporting Chairman Zhou's correct and timely report, I am willing to contribute all my strength to the struggle to liberate Taiwan and strive to complete the sacred task of liberating all of China.

    孙蔚如的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，并同意李济深副主席、郭沫若副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武副主席、陈伯达委员的各项重要报告，同时愿以最大努力，贯彻执行。
    解放6年多以来，我国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在各项社会改革和社会主义建设事业中取得了一连串的胜利。在短短的6年中我们已经把旧中国遗留下来的落后面貌大大的改变了。目前，农业社会主义改造的高潮在全国范围内蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来，资本主义工商业的社会主义改造和手工业合作化的高潮在全国大中小城市中也随之而来，人民的生活水平正在不断地改善和提高，全国人民到处欢欣鼓舞，歌颂人民政权的优越性，这真是喜事重重，使每个人都感觉到生活在毛泽东时代的新中国而自豪。
    关于知识分子的问题，周恩来主席在报告中指出：为提早完成社会主义改造的任务，“不仅要依靠工人阶级和广大农民的创造性的劳动，而且要充分动员和发挥我国知识分子的力量。”我国知识分子虽然在过去各项工作中对国家也作出了重大的贡献，但事实证明工农群众建设社会主义的积极性和社会主义的觉悟已经跑到前边去了，而知识分子的觉悟水平、业务水平等却远远落在客观现实的后面。因此，进一步地提高现有知识分子和大批地培养新生力量便成为当前的急务。
    我参与政协陕西省委员会和民革陕西省委员会的领导工作，在这几年工作的实践中，深深体会到周恩来主席在报告中指出的知识分子的改造，通常经过三条道路的正确性，尤其是“经过社会生活的观察和实践”的效果为最大。我不久以前参加宝成铁路广元至略阳段通车典礼时，看见工人们在堑山堙谷地战胜了巴山、秦岭，使古人所谓“难于上青天”的蜀道，今天已经安全地通过了火车。工人们那种为社会主义建设事业进行着忘我劳动的勇敢精神，使我受到极大的感动，觉得自己个人的力量太渺小了，自己做的事情太少了。去年秋季我在陕西商?山区视察农业合作化的时候，看见山区农民响应党和毛主席的召号，热烈地参加农业生产合作社，汹涌澎湃地向着共同富裕和繁荣幸福的社会主义道路前进，使我受到很大的鼓舞和深刻的教育。因此，我认为深入工农群众、向群众学习是知识分子思想改造最有效的方法。
    今后我要继续进一步地学习马克思列宁主义，结合思想实际、工作实际，大力进行自我教育和自我改造，并向我所联系的群众互相帮助，互相学习，在党和毛主席的正确领导下为社会主义建设事业贡献出一切力量。
    关于解放台湾问题，周恩来主席在报告中已经庄严地指出：“除了用战争方式解放台湾以外，还存在着用和平方式解放台湾的可能性。这样，我国大陆人民和台湾人民就有一种共同的爱国的责任，这就是除了积极准备在必要的时候用战争方式解放台湾以外，努力争取用和平方式解放台湾。”周恩来主席的报告明确地指出了我们解放台湾的两种方式。我在这里忠告逃到台湾去的一些我相识的朋友们，你们应该猛醒过来，现在是选择自己正确生路的时候了，你们继续追随着美国帝国主义，最后只有绝路一条，如能幡然悔悟，通过和平途径解放台湾，使台湾同胞早日回到祖国的怀抱，你们定会得到祖国人民的宽恕，这是你们应当走的唯一的正确的光明大道。
    我对周主席这个正确适时的报告，除竭诚拥护外，更愿在解放台湾的斗争中，贡献出自己的一切力量，为完成解放全中国的神圣任务而奋斗。
