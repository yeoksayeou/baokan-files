    Reclamation of 750,000 Hectares of Wasteland
    Heilongjiang Province is stepping up preparations for reclaiming 750,000 hectares of wasteland this year. Among the wasteland to be reclaimed, 400,000 hectares are planned to be cultivated by 150,000 immigrant households and youth reclamation teams who will be moved from within the customs area (关内) and urban areas of the province to the countryside. The remaining land will be used to expand and establish 30 state-owned grain farms and increase the cultivated land area of agricultural production cooperatives.
    In reclaiming these 750,000 hectares of wasteland this year, Heilongjiang Province will promote the wasteland reclamation experience of the state-owned Friendship Farm last year, so that 230,000 hectares of newly reclaimed land can be sown in the same year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    开垦75万公顷荒地
    黑龙江省今年开垦75万公顷荒地的准备工作正在加紧进行。在将要开垦的荒地中，有40万公顷准备给即将从关内和本省城镇移到农村的15万户移民和青年垦荒队耕种。其余将用来扩建和新建30处国营谷物农场和扩大农业生产合作社的耕地面积。
