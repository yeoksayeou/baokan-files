To adapt to the new situation of the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement, agricultural technology extension stations in various regions will greatly develop this year. According to preliminary plans from various provinces, more than 8,000 new agricultural technology extension stations will be established nationwide this year. Together with the existing stations, there will be more than 16,000 agricultural technology extension stations nationwide, and about 90% of districts in rural areas will have stations. In order for the large number of agricultural technology extension stations to play a role in spring plowing, provinces such as Hebei and Jilin have decided to complete the task of establishing stations before the spring plowing season.

The existing agricultural technology extension stations in various regions will also expand the scope of technical guidance. Shanxi Province this year requires each station in the plains to be responsible for guiding the cultivation of 30,000 mu of cultivated land, and each station in mountainous areas and concentrated paddy field areas to be responsible for guiding the cultivation of more than 20,000 mu of cultivated land. Agricultural technology extension stations in Hebei, Henan, and Guangdong provinces plan to train more than 2.4 million technicians for agricultural production cooperatives this year. Shanxi Province also requires each station to be responsible for establishing two technical night schools and to organize trained technicians and rural cadres to return to the villages to impart technology, so that 3 million to 5 million people in the province will receive scientific agricultural production technology education this year.

    全国将新建八千多农业技术推广站
    适应农业合作化运动大发展的新形势，今年各地农业技术推广站将有很大的发展。根据各省的初步计划，今年全国将新建立8，000多个农业技术推广站，连同原有的站，全国将一共有农业技术推广站16，000多个，农村中约90％的区都将有站。为了使大批农业技术推广站在春耕中发挥作用，河北、吉林等省已经决定提前在春耕以前完成建站任务。
    各地原有的农业技术推广站也将扩大技术指导范围。山西省今年要求平原地区每站负责指导三万亩耕地的耕作，山区和水田集中地区每站负责指导两万亩以上耕地的耕作。河北、河南、广东三省的农业技术推广站，今年计划为农业生产合作社训练各种技术员240多万名。山西省还要求每个站负责建立两所技术夜校，并且要组织经过训练的技术员、农村干部等回村传授技术，使全省在今年内有300万到500万人受到科学的农业生产技术教育。
