Anhui Province is building its first rural small-scale hydropower station. This hydropower station is being built next to the waterfall of the West Main Canal of the Tonggong Dam in Xuancheng County.

　　After the hydropower station is completed, it can generate 30 kilowatts of electricity. After the Spring Festival this year, it will be able to transmit electricity to the nearby Shuangqiao Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative, for the cooperative to use for drainage, irrigation, develop sideline production, and provide lighting at night.

    安徽兴建第一座小型水电站
    安徽省正在兴建第一座农村小型水力发电站。这座水力发电站建筑在宣城县佟公坝西干渠的跌水旁边。
    这座水电站建成以后，可以发电30瓩。今年春节以后，它就可以把电流输送到附近的双桥高级农业生产合作社，供这个社用来排水，灌溉，发展副业生产和在晚间照明。
