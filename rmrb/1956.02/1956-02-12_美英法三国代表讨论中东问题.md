Xinhua News Agency, Washington dispatch: The United States, Britain, and France began a conference in Washington on February 8 regarding the Middle East issue.

This meeting was arranged during the recent talks between Eisenhower and Eden in Washington.

A communique issued after the meeting that day stated that the meeting was to discuss the so-called "responsibility" that the United States, Britain, and France assumed under the declaration issued by these three countries in 1950 regarding intervention in Middle Eastern affairs.

News from Cairo said that Egyptian newspapers protested this new intervention in the affairs of Arab countries by Western countries. An editorial in "Al-Gomhuria" asked: "Who authorized the representatives of Western countries to discuss Middle East issues? Not the people of the Arab countries."

    美英法三国代表讨论中东问题
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美、英、法三国关于中东问题的会议2月8日开始在华盛顿举行。
    这次会议是艾森豪威尔和艾登最近在华盛顿会谈时安排的。
    当天会后发表的公报说，会议是讨论美、英、法三国根据这三个国家在1950年发表的干涉中东事务的宣言所承担的所谓“责任”。
    从开罗来的消息说，埃及各报抗议西方国家这个对阿拉伯国家事务的新的干涉。“共和国报”的社论问道：“是谁授权给西方国家代表讨论中东问题的？不是阿拉伯各国人民。”
