Resolution on Strengthening Trade Union Work in the Socialist Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce

I.

Currently, a high tide of turning capitalist industry and commerce into joint state-private enterprises by entire trades has been set off across the country. Following the rapid realization of the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce into joint state-private enterprises by entire trades in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce into joint state-private enterprises by entire trades will be successively realized in cities across the country. Rapidly strengthening trade union work in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and greatly developing the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff, and actively assisting state organs in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and capitalists, is an extremely important, urgent, and glorious historical task in the current work of trade unions nationwide.

II.

In order to victoriously assist state organs in completing the task of transforming capitalist industry and commerce and capitalists, trade union organizations at all levels must first vigorously strengthen the political and ideological education of the broad masses of workers and staff in capitalist enterprises and joint state-private enterprises. At present, in addition to explaining the basic content and great significance of the peaceful transformation policy and the "redemption" policy to the broad masses of workers and staff more extensively and deeply, it is also necessary to focus on strengthening the unity education of the working class. After enterprises become joint state-private, especially after mergers of factories and shops, workers and staff should be educated to respect each other, learn from each other, have the part submit to the whole, and the advanced help the backward, to give full play to their initiative and creativity to complete the tasks of production and operation. When educating the workers and staff, special attention should be paid to strengthening the political and ideological education of office staff and technicians.

At the same time, trade unions should also mobilize workers and staff to educate capitalists on unity and transformation. Before the joint operation, trade unions should organize workers and capitalists to conduct good consultations, help capitalists and their families recognize the Party's guidelines and policies for the transformation of capitalist enterprises, recognize their bright future, and break through ideological concerns. After the joint operation, although the capitalists have not changed their class status, many capitalists have taken on substantive jobs and become employees of joint state-private enterprises. On the one hand, trade unions should educate workers and staff to respect their administrative powers so that they can fulfill their duties and responsibilities; on the other hand, they should also strengthen their ideological education and strive for the vast majority of them to be transformed from exploiters into self-reliant laborers. Trade unions should absorb them to participate in general meetings of all workers and staff and welcome them to participate in socialist emulation. Their inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals should be seriously handled and given due praise and rewards. Appropriate criticism and education must also be given for their shortcomings and errors in their work. Vigilance should be maintained at all times against the illegal acts of a few capitalists who withdraw funds before or during the inventory of assets, as well as other acts of resisting socialist transformation, and these acts should be exposed and struggled against. Trade unions should educate the workers and staff that the working class's position must be clear and firm, and the boundary between the working class and the bourgeoisie must be clearly defined, but this should never lead to fear of approaching capitalists, let alone abandonment of the working class's responsibility to unite, educate, and transform the capitalists.

III.

The fundamental purpose of carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is to eliminate the capitalist system of exploitation, liberate and develop social productive forces, and continuously improve the material and cultural lives of the working masses on this basis.

The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has developed rapidly, and capitalist industry and commerce nationwide have basically implemented joint state-private operation by trade. This is a great victory. However, after the joint operation, there are still many problems to be solved. In addition to carrying out the above-mentioned ideological education work, trade union organizations must also actively assist the government in asset inventory, capital verification, personnel arrangements, economic reorganization, institutional adjustments, and system reforms to ensure the correct implementation of the Party and government's various policies. The solution of these problems requires in-depth investigation, specific analysis, formulation of plans, and step-by-step implementation.

After enterprises become joint state-private, all workers and staff should be mobilized to consolidate labor discipline, correct service attitudes, carry out socialist emulation, improve technology, and improve business management, greatly increase labor productivity, and further improve quality, increase variety, reduce costs on the original basis, and ensure the early and comprehensive completion of the first Five-Year Plan to demonstrate the superiority of joint state-private enterprises over capitalist enterprises. Existing experience has proven that establishing a democratic management committee after the implementation of joint state-private operation has a great effect on giving play to the enthusiasm of the workers and staff, assisting state representatives in the transformation of enterprises, and transforming the work of capitalists. In general joint state-private enterprises (excluding old joint enterprises), such organizations can be established.

After enterprises become joint state-private, the jobs of workers and staff should be guaranteed. Before the government promulgates unified methods, the wages and benefits of workers and staff should be basically maintained as they were and should not be lower than before the joint operation. This issue concerns the vital interests of the broad masses and should never be rushed or acted recklessly upon.

IV.

Under the new situation of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, many new problems have also arisen in the work of trade union organizations, and the following measures should be taken:

First, in the case of implementing joint state-private operation by entire trades, the original trade union organizations in capitalist enterprises should establish trade union organizations according to the administrative management system of the merged industries (such as the administrative management system of specialized companies). These trade union organizations should be subordinate to the relevant industrial trade unions. Trade union organizations in joint state-private enterprises that do not belong to existing industrial trade unions are still led by local trade union federations. Trade union organizations at all levels of industrial trade unions should actively strengthen their work in this area.

Second, the current trade union organizations in private enterprises and trade union organizations in joint state-private enterprises should vigorously improve their own organizations, widely absorb activists to participate in various trade union activities, equip more deputy positions, and prepare to transport cadres to the Party and the administration so that the trade union organization can still operate normally after the existing trade union cadres are transferred to do other work.

Third, in order to make trade unions truly widespread mass combat organizations, give full play to the role of trade unions in uniting and educating the broad masses of workers and staff, and victoriously complete the arduous task of transforming capitalist enterprises, trade union organizations in joint state-private enterprises should attach great importance to the work of developing membership. Those workers and staff who have not yet joined the trade union must be actively absorbed into the trade union organization. For capitalists who were originally workers or other laborers, if they actually no longer have shares and their livelihood is entirely or mainly based on their wage income, their applications to join the trade union should also be accepted and admitted in accordance with the trade union constitution. Regarding the issue of capitalists who have given up exploitation and joined the work force joining the trade union after the enterprise becomes joint state-private, the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is responsible for making a special decision.

V.

After capitalist industry and commerce are approved for joint state-private operation by entire trades, they must also undergo necessary economic reorganization and production reorganization under the overall planning and unified arrangement of state organs and according to the needs of the planned development of the national economy. This task is very arduous and very complex. Therefore, during and after the implementation of joint state-private operation by entire trades, the responsibility of trade union organizations has not been reduced, but has been greatly increased. Trade union organizations at all levels must strengthen trade union work in joint state-private enterprises, promptly summarize and exchange experiences in their work, discover and solve new problems in their work, and, under the leadership of the Party, closely connect with the masses, organize and educate the masses, and assist state organs in victoriously completing the historical task of implementing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

### 关于加强资本主义工商业社会主义改造中工会工作的决议

    关于加强资本主义工商业社会主义改造中工会工作的决议
    一
    目前，在全国范围内已经掀起了一个资本主义工商业按行业全部实行公私合营的高潮。在北京、上海、天津等城市的资本主义工商业迅速地实现了全行业的公私合营之后，全国各城市资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营也将先后实现。迅速地加强对资本主义工商业社会主义改造中的工会工作，大大地发扬广大职工群众的社会主义积极性，积极地协助国家机关进行对资本主义工商业和对资本家的改造工作，是当前全国工会工作中的一项极其重大、紧迫而光荣的历史任务。
    二
    为了胜利地协助国家机关完成对资本主义工商业和对资本家的改造任务，工会各级组织首先必须大力加强对资本主义企业和公私合营企业中广大职工群众的政治思想教育。目前，除掉要更加广泛而深入地向广大职工群众说明和平改造的方针和“赎买”政策的基本内容及其重大意义而外，还要着重加强工人阶级的团结教育。在企业公私合营以后，特别是并厂、并店以后，应该教育职工群众互相尊重，互相学习，局部服从全体，先进帮助落后，充分地发挥积极性和创造性来完成生产和营业的任务。在对职工群众进行教育的时候，要特别注意加强对职员和技术人员的政治思想教育。
    同时，工会还应该发动职工群众对资本家进行团结和改造的教育。在合营以前，工会应该组织职工同资本家很好地进行协商，帮助资本家及其家属认清党对资本主义企业改造的方针和政策，认清自己的光明前途，打破思想顾虑。在合营以后，虽然资本家还没有改变成分，但是不少资本家都担任了实职工作，成为公私合营企业的工作人员，工会一方面要教育职工尊重他们的行政职权，使他们能够尽职尽责；另一方面，还要加强对他们的思想教育，争取他们中的绝大多数人，由剥削者改造成为自食其力的劳动者。工会召开全体职工大会，应该吸收他们参加，并且欢迎他们参加社会主义竞赛。对于他们的创造发明、技术改进、合理化建议，要认真地处理，并且给予应得的表扬和奖励。对于他们在工作中所发生的缺点和错误，也必须给以适当的批评教育。对于少数资本家在清产核资前或在清产核资过程中抽逃资金、以及其它抗拒社会主义改造的不法行为，都应该随时提高警惕，进行揭露和斗争。工会应该教育职工群众：工人阶级的立场必须明确坚定，工人阶级和资产阶级的界限必须划清，但是，绝不能因此而害怕同资本家接近，更不能因此而放弃工人阶级对资本家团结、教育和改造的责任。
    三
    对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的根本目的，就是消灭资本主义的剥削制度，解放和发展社会生产力，并且在这个基础上来不断地改善劳动群众的物质生活和文化生活。
    资本主义工商业的社会主义改造发展得很快，全国资本主义工商业基本上已经按行按业实行了公私合营，这是一个很大的胜利。但是合营以后，还有许多问题需要解决。工会组织除了进行上述思想教育工作外，还必须积极地协助政府进行清理资产、核定资金、安排人事、实行经济改组、调整机构、改革制度等工作，来保证党和政府的各种政策的正确实施。这些问题的解决，都需要经过深入地调查，具体地分析，做出方案，有步骤地进行。
    在企业公私合营以后，应该发动全体职工群众巩固劳动纪律，端正服务态度，开展社会主义竞赛，改进技术和改善经营管理，大大地提高劳动生产率，在原有的基础上进一步提高质量，增加品种，降低成本，保证提早和全面完成第一个五年计划，以显示公私合营企业较资本主义企业具有的优越性。已有的经验证明：在实行公私合营以后，成立民主管理委员会，对于发挥职工群众的积极性、协助国家代表改造企业以及改造资本家的工作，都有很大的作用，在一般公私合营企业中（老合营企业除外），都可以建立这种组织。
    在企业公私合营以后，职工的工作应予保证。职工的工资福利待遇在政府没有颁布统一的办法以前，基本上维持原状，不能比合营前降低。这个问题关系着广大群众的切身利益，绝不可以操之过急，鲁莽从事。
    四
    在资本主义工商业社会主义改造的新形势下，在工会组织工作方面也发生了许多新问题，应该采取如下措施：
    第一、在实行全行业公私合营的情况下，原来资本主义企业中的工会组织，应该按照各行业合营后的行政管理系统（如专业公司的行政管理系统）建立工会组织。这些工会组织应该隶属于有关的产业工会。不属于现有产业工会的公私合营企业中的工会组织，仍然由当地工会联合会领导。产业工会的各级组织，都应该积极地加强在这方面的工作。
    第二、现在私营企业中的工会组织和公私合营企业中的工会组织，应该大力地健全自己的组织，广泛地吸收积极分子参加工会的各种活动，多配备一些副职，有准备地向党和行政输送干部，以便在现有的工会干部被调去做其他工作以后，工会组织仍然能够正常地进行工作。
    第三、为了使工会真正成为广泛的群众性的战斗组织，充分发挥工会团结和教育广大职工群众的作用，胜利地完成对资本主义企业改造的艰巨任务，公私合营企业中的工会组织，应该十分重视发展会员的工作。对于那些还没有参加工会的职工，必须积极地吸收他们参加到工会组织中来。对于原来是工人或者是其他劳动者出身的资本家，如果他们现在实际上已经没有股金、而是以自己工资收入为生活资料的全部或主要来源，也应该接受他们加入工会的申请，按照工会章程吸收入会。关于在企业公私合营后，放弃剥削、参加工作的资本家加入工会的问题，责成中华全国总工会书记处做一个专门决定。五
    资本主义工商业在被批准全行业公私合营以后，还必须在国家机关的全面规划、统筹安排下，根据国民经济有计划发展的需要进行必要的经济改组和生产改组，这项任务是十分艰巨和十分复杂的。因此，在实行全行业公私合营的过程中和合营以后，工会组织的责任不是减轻了，而是大大地加重了。工会各级组织必须加强公私合营企业中的工会工作，及时地总结和交流工作中的经验，发现和解决工作中的新问题，在党的领导下，紧密地联系群众，组织和教育群众，协助国家机关胜利地完成对资本家工商业实行社会主义改造的历史任务。
