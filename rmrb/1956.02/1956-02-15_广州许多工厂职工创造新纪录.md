Guangzhou City factory and enterprise workers are setting new production records one after another.

In the state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill, each workshop has continuously set new production records since the factory's opening in the past half month. The cooking time for each pot of chemical wood pulp in the pulping workshop has been shortened by about 1.5 hours compared to the newly revised quota. In some processes of manufacturing double-wheeled double-shared plows at the local state-owned Guangdong Farm Implement Factory, labor productivity has been increased by one to five times, enabling the factory to overfulfill its production plan for the first ten days of this month by the 5th. The product qualification rate of the joint state-private Yifeng Enamel Factory recently reached a maximum of 99.85%, and the output increased by 11.4% compared to the quota.

Now, workers in factories such as the state-owned Guangzhou General Machinery Factory, Guangzhou Shipyard of the China Ocean Shipping Company, the joint state-private Huanan Sewing Machine Factory, and the Huajian Ramie Textile Factory have all set targets and measures to complete the First Five-Year Plan more than one year ahead of schedule. The leadership of the local state-owned Guangdong Ramie Factory proposed the requirement to complete the First Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. After discussion among the workers, the production target was increased by another 15%.

    广州市工厂企业职工纷纷创造生产新纪录。
    国营广州造纸厂各车间最近半个月来连续创造开厂以来的生产新纪录，制浆车间每锅化学木浆蒸煮的时间比新修订的定额又缩短了1小时半左右。地方国营广东农具厂在制造双轮双铧犁的一些工序中把劳动生产率提高了一倍到五倍，使本月上旬的生产计划在5日就超额完成了。公私合营益丰搪瓷厂最近的产品正品率最高达到99.85％，产量比定额提高11.4％。
    现在国营广州通用机器厂、海运总局广州船舶修造厂、公私合营华南缝纫机制造厂和华建麻纺织厂等厂的职工都订出提早一年多完成第一个五年计划的指标和措施。地方国营广东苎麻厂领导上提出提早一年完成第一个五年计划的要求，经过职工的讨论，又将生产指标提高了15％。
