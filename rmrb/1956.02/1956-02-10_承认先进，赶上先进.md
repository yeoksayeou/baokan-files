    Acknowledge the Advanced, Catch Up with the Advanced
    By Our Correspondent Gu Ye
    The Zhang Fugui tunneling team of the Datong Coal Mine completed its January tunneling plan more than ten days ahead of schedule.
    In 1955, the workers of this tunneling team fought unyieldingly against numerous difficulties. In the tunneling roadways with thinner coal seams, they drilled holes lying on their sides, loaded coal sitting down, and pushed coal carts crawling. Finally, they comprehensively overfulfilled the annual tunneling task. At the end of last year, when the workers discussed the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, they learned that the team should tunnel more than 23,300 meters by 1957. In the first three years, they had cumulatively completed more than 15,500 meters. If they tunneled more than 7,800 meters in 1956, they could complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. In 1955, the team only tunneled more than 6,000 meters. Was it possible to tunnel more than 7,800 meters in 1956? The workers compared themselves with the Zhang Wanfu rapid tunneling team and said: We are in a thin coal seam, and they are also in a thin coal seam. We always hear that the Zhang Wanfu team is very united, and we are also quite united. But why were they able to tunnel more than 8,200 meters in 1955? They must have some tricks. If we find these tricks, it will be no problem to complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.
    At this time, because the Zhang Wanfu team created a new national record of 1,076 meters of tunneling per month, the leadership organized Zhang Fugui, Zhang Chenglai, and other tunneling team leaders to visit and learn from the Zhang Wanfu tunneling team's roadways. Zhang Fugui was extremely excited. Although some conditions in his own roadways were different from those of the Zhang Wanfu team, he listened carefully to their introductions and focused on finding the areas where they were more advanced than himself. After the visit, he said: The "snake shedding its skin" shift handover system and segmented cyclical transport of the Zhang Wanfu team are really good, and we must learn them well. After he conveyed this to the workers, the workers unanimously expressed: We are determined to learn from the advanced.
    From then on, the situation in the roadways changed. They seriously implemented the "snake shedding its skin" shift handover system, eliminating wasted labor. In the past, during shift handovers, the workers often wasted an hour each shift because the division of labor was not clear, and the workers did not know whose work to take over when they arrived at their work positions. Now, the previous shift prepares empty roadways, stored coal, blasting materials, etc. for the next shift, and uses the telephone to tell the cadres at the wellhead what materials the next shift needs, how much explosives to collect, and which roadway to go to for the shift handover. The next shift, based on the information reported by the previous shift by telephone, clearly divides the labor, prepares separately, and then goes down the well to implement the handover of work types from work type to work type, and individual to individual. After the drilling workers complete the inspection, they immediately go to the empty roadways to drill holes; the coal loading workers pick up their shovels and load coal; and the cart pushing workers pick up the carts and push the coal out. In the past, the workers going on shift walked empty-handed to the work face, and the workers going off shift walked empty-handed out of the roadways; now, the workers going on shift push empty carts in when they see them, and the workers going off shift push coal carts out when they see them, so that the coal transport work is not interrupted by the shift handover. In this way, each shift pushes out more than 20 more carts of coal than before.
    After the transport workers implemented the segmented cyclical transport experience, each shift pushed two more rounds of blasted coal than before, thereby allowing each shift to tunnel a few more meters.
    The workers also learned the spirit of close collaboration from the Zhang Wanfu team. During the operation, the transport workers helped the drilling workers deliver explosives and blasting materials, so that the drilling workers were not delayed in tunneling because of fetching explosives and blasting materials. Because the roof was poor, every time a round of blasting was done, a layer of stone more than 20 centimeters thick would collapse along with the coal. Before the transport workers shoveled coal into carts, they had to spend a lot of time picking up stones, so the drilling workers and security workers volunteered to pick up the stones.
    By implementing the advanced experience of the Zhang Wanfu team, the tunneling progress of the Zhang Fugui team was greatly accelerated. At the end of the month, statistics showed that the tunneling progress completed 192.61% of the plan, the output exceeded the plan by more than double, the efficiency exceeded the plan by more than half, and the cost was also greatly reduced, with an average daily tunneling of more than 24 meters, exceeding the required daily progress of 23.4 meters for completing the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.
    At the activist conference held by the Mining Bureau in mid-January, this team and the Zhang Wanfu tunneling team jointly launched a competition to tunnel 10,000 meters for the whole year across the entire mine.
    The situation of the Zhang Chenglai tunneling team was just the opposite. When Zhang Chenglai went to visit and learn from the Zhang Wanfu rapid tunneling team's roadways, he adopted a completely opposite attitude to Zhang Fugui, always believing that he had many difficulties and that there was nothing to learn from the Zhang Wanfu team's experience. As a result, none of the indicators for January were completed.
    This fact proves that to catch up with the advanced, we must first acknowledge the advanced. As long as we humbly learn from the advanced experience of others, we can become advanced. If we close our eyes and do not see the strengths of others, or only emphasize our own difficulties and refuse to learn from the experience of others, we will definitely not do a good job and will definitely fall behind.

    承认先进，赶上先进
    本报记者　顾页
    大同煤矿张富贵掘进组，提前十几天完成了1月份的掘进计划。
    这个掘进组的工人们，在1955年曾经和重重困难进行过不屈不挠的战斗，在煤层较薄的掘进巷道里，他们斜躺着打眼，坐着装煤，爬着推煤车，最后终于全面地超额完成了全年的掘进任务。去年年底，工人们讨论执行五年计划的情况的时候，知道了全组到1957年应该掘进23，300多公尺，前三年累计已经完成15，500多公尺，如果在1956年还掘进7，800多公尺，那末就可以提前一年完成五年计划。1955年全组只掘进6，000多公尺，1956年掘进7，800多公尺行吗？工人们拿自己跟张万福快速掘进组比较，都说：我们在薄煤层，他们也在薄煤层，平日听说张万福组团结得好，我们也团结得不坏，可是，为什么他们在1955年能掘进8，200多公尺？他们一定有什么窍门，要是找到这个窍门，提前一年完成五年计划就没问题了。
    这时候，因为张万福组创造了月进1，076公尺的全国新纪录，领导上组织张富贵、张成来等掘进组长到张万福掘进组的巷道去参观学习。张富贵兴奋极了，虽然自己所在的巷道，有某些条件跟张万福组的不一样，但是，他仔细地听人家介绍，专心去寻找那些比自己先进的地方。参观完了，他说：张万福组的“蛇退皮”交接班制度和分段循环运搬确实好，我们一定把它学好。他向工人们传达以后，工人们一致表示：坚决向先进看齐。
    从此，巷道里的情形变了。他们认真地推行了“蛇退皮”交接班制度，消灭了窝工浪费。过去，交接班的时候，往往因为分工不明确，工人到了工作岗位还不知道接谁的工作，每班就浪费了一个小时。现在上一班都为下一班准备好空巷、存煤、炮土等等，并利用电话告诉井口干部：下一班还需要些什么材料，领多少炮药，到哪一条巷去接班。下一班在井上根据上一班电话汇报的情况，明确分工，分头准备，然后下井实行工种同工种、个人同个人的交接。打眼工人验收完了，立即到空巷去打眼；装车工人接过铁锹就装煤；推车工人接了车就往外推煤。过去，上班的人空着手走到工作面，下班的人空着手走出巷道；现在上班的人遇到空车，顺便把它推进去了，下班的人遇到煤车，也顺便把它推出来，使运煤工作不致为交接班而中断。这样，每班都比过去多推出20多车煤。
    运搬工人推行了分段循环运搬经验以后，每班比过去多推两茬炮的煤，从而使每班多掘进了几公尺。
    工人们也学习了张万福组密切协作的精神，在操作过程中，运搬工人帮助打眼工人送炮药和炮土，使打眼工人不因为取炮药炮土耽误掘进。因为顶板不好，每放一茬炮，就有一层20多公分厚的石头随着煤坍落下来，运搬工人在铲煤装车之前，还得用很多时间拣石头，打眼工人和保安工人就主动拣石头。
    推行张万福组的先进经验，张富贵组的掘进进度便大大加快了。到月底统计，掘进进度完成计划192.61％，产量超过计划一倍以上，效率超过计划半倍多，成本也大大降低，平均每天掘进24公尺以上，超过了提前一年完成五年计划所规定的日进23.4公尺的要求。
    这个组在矿务局1月中旬召开的积极分子大会上和张万福掘进组一起向全矿发起全年掘进一万公尺的竞赛。
    张成来掘进组的情形恰恰相反。张成来在去张万福快速掘进组巷道参观学习的时候，采取了和张富贵完全相反的态度，总认为自己的困难很多，张万福组的经验没有什么可学的，结果，1月份的各项指标都没有完成。
    这一事实证明：要赶上先进，必须首先承认先进，只要虚心学习别人的先进经验，自己就能成为先进。如果闭着眼睛不看别人的长处，或者只强调自己的困难，拒绝学习别人的经验，就一定搞不好工作，就一定落后。
