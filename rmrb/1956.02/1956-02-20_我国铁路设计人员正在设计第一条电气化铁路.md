    China's first group of technicians designing electrified railways has rapidly matured under the tutelage of Soviet experts. Currently, these personnel are undertaking the technical design for the first railway to run electric locomotives – the Baoji to Fengxian section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.
    In the past, China lacked the talent to design electrified railways. With the help and guidance of Soviet electrification experts, the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways gathered a group of engineers and young technicians to learn while simultaneously designing electrified railways. Now, these personnel have preliminarily mastered the design work for a complete set of electrification systems, including traction substations, catenary networks, and electric locomotive depots. The portion of the design drawings for the Baoji-Fengxian section of the electrified railway that they have completed has been assessed and found to be up to standard. It is expected that the design of the Baoji-Fengxian section of the electrified railway by these personnel can be completed more than a month ahead of schedule, in May of this year.

    我国铁路设计人员正在设计第一条电气化铁路
    中国第一批设计电气化铁路的技术人员，已经在苏联专家的培养下迅速成长起来。现在，这批人员正在进行第一条行驶电气机车的铁路——宝成铁路宝鸡至凤县段的技术设计。
    过去，中国没有设计电气化铁路的人才。在苏联电气化专家的帮助指导下，铁道部第一设计院集中了一批工程师和青年技术人员，一边学习，一边进行电气化铁路的设计。现在，这些人员已经初步学会了牵引变电所、接触线网、电气机车库等整套电气化的设计工作。他们所完成的宝鸡—凤县段电气化铁路的一部分设计图，经过鉴定，质量都合乎标准。这批人员设计的宝鸡—凤县段电气化铁路，预计可提前一个多月在今年5月间完成。　（新华社）
