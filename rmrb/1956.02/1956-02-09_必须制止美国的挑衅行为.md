Observer Commentary:

    The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement yesterday, expressing a serious protest against the provocative acts of the United States in blatantly releasing a large number of military reconnaissance balloons into China's airspace recently. Recent news shows that these provocations are planned and organized, because large numbers of balloons released by American agencies have also been discovered over the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, and Albania.

    As early as last September, the Soviet government had requested the U.S. government to take necessary measures to stop American agencies from releasing such balloons. At the same time, the Czechoslovak government had repeatedly urged the United States to pay attention to the balloon issue. However, the American authorities completely disregarded these protests and have recently intensified the simultaneous release of more and more balloons over Eastern Europe and the Far East to peaceful democratic countries, and have repeatedly and publicly stated that they are not prepared to stop these provocative acts.

    The American authorities attempt to justify their provocative behavior with pretexts such as "collecting weather materials" and "for scientific research." But the facts have long refuted the American claims. These balloons are not ordinary balloons, but large balloons with a diameter of nearly 40 feet, which are easily explosive. They carry not ordinary weather instruments, but automatic cameras that can photograph the terrain below from the air, radio transceivers, and a large number of propaganda materials that slander peaceful democratic countries. Everyone knows that such equipment is fundamentally impossible to associate with "scientific research."

    In order to deny the crime of conducting reconnaissance and harassment activities against peaceful democratic countries, a U.S. State Department spokesman recently claimed that these balloons were released by the so-called "Crusade for Freedom" and "Radio Free Europe," which operate in West Germany. But it is no longer a secret that these reactionary organizations of Eastern European exiled politicians, who are spurned by the people, receive American subsidies and conduct subversive and destructive activities against peace-loving countries under the direct guidance of the United States, and the facts prove that the United States itself is the releaser of the balloons. According to foreign news agencies, on February 6, the very same day that the U.S. State Department spokesman tried to declare that the United States had not released balloons to peaceful democratic countries, an American official in West Germany publicly admitted that despite protests from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, "balloons carrying meteorological equipment (?) or propaganda leaflets will continue to be released on a 'normal basis.'"

    The American act of arbitrarily releasing military reconnaissance balloons seriously violates the airspace of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries, and violates the universally recognized principles of international law. People see once again that, in order to increase international tension, the American ruling clique does not hesitate to use any despicable means as a tool of the "Cold War." This behavior runs counter to the desire of the people of all countries to promote international cooperation. Everyone clearly remembers that just a few days ago, Eisenhower said in his reply to Bulganin's letter: "What is important is action, not just words." People have reason to ask this question: Is this action of the United States intended to strengthen international cooperation or to exacerbate international tensions?

    The provocative behavior of the United States has not only been resolutely protested by the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, but has also aroused the unease and opposition of other countries. Because these balloons have also floated over the United Kingdom and Austria, threatening the aviation safety of these countries. The people of all countries demand that the United States immediately stop this intolerable criminal activity.

### 必须制止美国的挑衅行为

    必须制止美国的挑衅行为
    中华人民共和国外交部发言人昨天发表声明，对美国最近期间公然向我国领空放送大量军事侦察气球的挑衅行为表示严重抗议。从最近的消息中可以看出，这种挑衅行为是有计划有组织地进行的，因为在苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的上空，也发现了由美国机构施放的大量气球。
    早在去年9月，苏联政府就已要求美国政府采取必要的措施，使美国机构停止放送这种气球。同时捷克斯洛伐克政府也曾就气球事屡次促请美国注意。但是美国当局完全不顾这种抗议，最近更是变本加厉地在东欧和远东同时向和平民主国家放送愈来愈多的气球，并且还一再公然表示不准备停止这种挑衅行为。
    美国当局企图以什么“收集气候材料的”和“供科学研究用的”的借口来为它的挑衅行为进行辩解。但是事实早已驳倒了美国的说法。这种气球并不是普通的气球，而是直径几达40英尺、容易爆炸的大气球。它们携带的也不是什么普通的测候仪器，而是可以从空中拍摄下面地形的自动摄影机、无线电收发报机以及对和平民主国家进行诽谤的大量宣传品。谁都知道，这种设备根本不可能同“科学研究”扯在一起。
    为了抵赖这种对和平民主国家进行侦察和骚扰活动的罪行，美国国务院发言人最近声称，这种气球是在西德活动的所谓“争取自由十字军”和“自由欧洲广播台”放送的。但是这早已不是一个秘密：这些遭到人民唾弃的东欧流亡政客的反动组织，是接受美国津贴并在美国直接指导下对爱好和平国家进行颠复破坏活动的，而且事实证明美国自己就是气球的施放者。据外国通讯社透露，就在2月6日美国国务院发言人竭力声明美国并没有向和平民主国家放送气球的同一天，在西德的一个美国官员却公开承认，尽管苏联和人民民主国家提出抗议，“携带气象设备（？）或宣传传单的气球将继续在‘正常的基础’上放出。”
    美国任意施放军事侦察气球的行为，严重地侵犯了苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的领空，并违背了公认的国际法原则。人们再一次看到，为了增加国际间的紧张气氛，美国统治集团甚至不惜利用任何卑劣的手段来作为“冷战”的工具。这种行为同各国人民要求增进国际合作的愿望是背道而驰的。大家还清楚地记得，就在几天以前，艾森豪威尔在答复布尔加宁的信里曾经这样说过：“重要的是行动而不光是言词”。人们有理由这样提出问题：美国的这种行动，究竟是为了加强国际合作呢，还是想加剧国际紧张局势？
    美国的挑衅行为不但遭到苏联、中国和人民民主国家人民的坚决抗议，而且也引起了其他国家的不安和反对。因为这种气球也飘到了英国和奥地利的上空，威胁到这些国家的航空安全。各国人民要求美国立即停止这种不可容忍的罪恶活动。
