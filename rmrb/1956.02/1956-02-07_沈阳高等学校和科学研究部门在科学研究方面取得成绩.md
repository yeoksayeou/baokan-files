In 1955, universities and scientific research departments in Shenyang initially achieved some results in scientific research work.

In Northeast Institute of Technology, four departments including mining and metallurgy completed 63 scientific research projects in the past year. Under the guidance of Professor Ma Yuhang, Ma Boling, an assistant teacher in the Tunneling Teaching and Research Group of the Mining Department, successfully researched and experimentally improved the "change of air inlet" of the rock drill in December 1955, increasing the efficiency of the OM506 rock drill for mines by 26%. Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory is now preparing to formally put this improved rock drill into production. Teachers from Shenyang Agricultural College have selected and bred excellent varieties of wheat and soybeans suitable for planting in the Liaoning area. Small-scale experiments of the good wheat varieties selected and bred by Gong Jidao, a professor in the Agronomy Department, etc., resulted in a yield increase of more than 50% compared to local varieties. Professor Qin Yaoting, etc., of the Parasitology Teaching and Research Group of China Medical University, went to Jilin Province for in-depth investigation and research to prevent and control "forest encephalitis" among loggers, and found preventive methods. This method can basically eliminate this infectious disease. The Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has conducted mineral processing tests and quality and technical evaluation tests on refractory raw materials for Daye and Baotou new iron and steel bases; and cooperated with Anshan Iron and Steel to successfully trial-produce new products such as "blast furnace clay bricks," while also helping some steel plants establish hydrogen fixing equipment. The Institute of Forestry and Soil Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has also achieved good results in researching "sand fixation afforestation" and "alkali soil improvement."

    沈阳高等学校和科学研究部门在科学研究方面取得成绩
    在沈阳的高等学校和科学研究部门，1955年一年中在科学研究工作方面，初步获得一些成绩。
    东北工学院采矿、冶金等4个学系去年一年已完成了63项科学研究工作。采矿系井巷教研组助教马柏龄在教授马宇航的指导下，1955年12月研究和试验改进凿岩机的“进气口的改变”获得成功，使矿山用OM506凿岩机提高效率26％。现在沈阳风动工具厂正准备把这种改进后的凿岩机正式投入生产。沈阳农学院教师选育出适合辽宁地区种植的小麦和大豆等优良品种。农学系教授龚畿道等选育的小麦良种在小面积试验结果，比本地品种增产50％以上。中国医科大学寄生虫教研组教授秦耀庭等，为防治伐木工人的“森林脑炎”病，曾到吉林省深入调查研究，找出了预防方法，用这种方法基本上可以消灭这种传染病。中国科学院金属研究所曾为大冶、包头新钢铁基地做选矿试验和耐火材料原料的质量评价及技术评价试验；并配合鞍钢试制成功“高炉粘土砖”等新产品，同时帮助一些钢铁厂建立了定氢设备。中国科学院林业土壤研究所研究“定砂造林”“碱土改良”等工作也获得了良好的成果。
