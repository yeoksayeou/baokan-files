Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 31st: Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, arrived in Warsaw by special train from Prague on the morning of January 30th, at the invitation of Aleksander Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish Council of State, and Józef Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers. Accompanying him on the visit were Marshal Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council of the People's Republic of China, and Liu Lantao, member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

At 10:30 AM, Vice Chairman Zhu De's special train entered the Central Station. Upon disembarking, Vice Chairman Zhu De shook hands with Polish United Workers' Party and government leaders such as Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, and Rokossovsky, who were there to welcome him.

Thousands of representatives from the masses of Warsaw gathered in the square in front of the station. A grand welcoming rally was held in the square.

Aleksander Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish Council of State, delivered a welcoming speech, first expressing, in the name of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Council of State, the Council of Ministers, and the entire Polish people, the most heartfelt welcome to Vice Chairman Zhu De and his entourage. He then said that as we welcome Comrade Zhu De and his companions, news from his great motherland is spreading around the world, earning the admiration and praise of all working people. This news concerns the great achievements of the People's Republic of China in its economy and culture, as well as the enormous scale of the revolutionary socialist transformation being carried out in cities and villages. We are confident that, despite the insidious schemes of the imperialists, the Chinese people's struggle to recover Taiwan, an island that has been Chinese since ancient times, and to restore the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, will soon achieve complete victory.

Vice Chairman Zhu De then spoke. In his speech, he first conveyed his sincere respect, on behalf of the Chinese people, to the heroic people of Warsaw and the entire Polish people. Zhu De said that the People's Republic of Poland's outstanding contributions to the struggle to safeguard peace in Europe and establish an all-European collective security system, and to maintaining peace in the Far East, particularly in supervising the implementation of the armistice agreements in Korea and Indochina, have been warmly praised by peace-loving people around the world. Recently, the "Declaration of the Warsaw Treaty Member States," signed by Poland together with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Europe, and firmly supported by the People's Republic of China, is a great contribution to the cause of peace in Europe and the world.

Zhu De finally emphasized that although China and Poland are geographically far apart, there has always been a deep friendship between the peoples of the two countries. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between the peoples of the two countries has been comprehensively developed. I hope that this visit will help enhance the fraternal friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

    波兰国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基致欢迎词，他首先代表波兰统一工人党中央委员会、国务委员会、部长会议和波兰全体人民，向朱德副主席等表示最衷心的欢迎。他接着说，正当我们欢迎朱德同志和他们同行人员的时候，来自他的伟大祖国的一些消息正在传遍全世界，博得了全体劳动人民的称羡和赞许，这些消息就是中华人民共和国的经济和文化的重大成就以及在城市和乡村中实行的革命的社会主义转变的巨大规模的事实。我们确信，尽管帝国主义者有着阴险的计谋，中国人民为了收复自古以来就是中国的岛屿台湾和恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位的斗争，将很快取得完全的胜利。
    朱德副主席接着讲话。他在讲话中首先代表中国人民向英雄的华沙人民和全体波兰人民致衷心的敬意。朱德说，人民波兰在为保障欧洲和平和建立全欧集体安全体系的斗争中、在维护远东和平、特别是监督实施朝鲜和印度支那的停战协定的工作中所作的卓越贡献，得到了世界爱好和平人民的热烈赞扬。最近，波兰同伟大的苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家一起签订并获得中华人民共和国的坚决支持的“华沙条约缔约国宣言”，是对欧洲和世界和平事业的巨大贡献。
    朱德最后强调说，中波两国在地理上虽然距离很远，但两国人民间一向存在着深厚的友谊。中华人民共和国成立后，两国人民的友谊得到了全面的发展。我希望我这次访问，能有助于增进两国人民的兄弟友谊。
