Comrades! Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, in the summary report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, made a comprehensive and profound analysis of our Party’s foreign and domestic policies, and reported to the 20th Congress of the CPSU the tremendous work carried out by the Party under the leadership of the Central Committee since the 19th Congress. The summary report clarified the fighting program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for striving for the victory of communism in our country. It can be confidently said that the Soviet people, who are infinitely loyal to the cause of our great Party, warmly approve and support this program, and will undoubtedly realize it.
	
The Party is organizing a new and powerful upsurge in all sectors of socialist industry and agriculture, and is implementing concrete measures aimed at further improving the material well-being and cultural level of the Soviet people.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government steadfastly implement a policy of maintaining and consolidating peace, a policy of international cooperation and developing relations with all countries. This policy demonstrates the fundamental interests of the Soviet people and meets the expectations of all peace-loving people.

From the summary report of the Central Committee, from the entire practice of socialist construction (of which we are participants), a conclusion can be drawn that during the period covered in the report, our Party has achieved new historically significant victories in both domestic and foreign policies. All Soviet people, Communists and non-Party members, workers and scientists, wholeheartedly approve and actively support the Communist Party’s wise policy with their labor, and firmly believe that our Central Committee will wisely, boldly, firmly, and confidently lead the Soviet people to successfully realize our country’s program of communist construction. (Applause)

Comrades! The decision to convene the 20th Congress of the Party aroused tremendous political and labor enthusiasm among the people of Georgia. The working people of the Republic extensively launched socialist emulation to greet the 20th Congress of the Party, and achieved new labor achievements. This is a clear sign of the great prestige of our Party and the Soviet people’s infinite loyalty to it.

The working people of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic warmly approve the draft directives of the 20th Congress of the CPSU on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, regarding it as a new and vivid manifestation of the Party and its Central Committee’s infinite concern for the further prosperity of the economy and culture of all the national republics of our great Soviet Union.

The Georgian people are working fruitfully in the fraternal family of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union. The achievements of the Georgian working people in economic and cultural construction are truly great. Thanks to the constant care of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, Georgia has become a prosperous republic. Socialist industry and multi-sectoral agriculture have developed smoothly year after year, equipped with advanced domestic machinery. Georgia’s rich culture flourishes and develops year after year. A large number of national scientific and cultural cadres capable of successfully solving the tasks of communist construction have been trained in the Republic.

The Georgian people, like all the nationalities of the Soviet Union, are deeply convinced in their many years of experience that the Communist Party has no interests other than the interests of the people, and that the goals of our Party are great and noble.

The Georgian people clearly understand that outstanding achievements in political, economic, and cultural life are only possible under the Soviet system and due to the unbreakable friendship of all nationalities. The unbreakable friendship of all nationalities is the reliable foundation for their prosperity and happiness.

The Party organization of Georgia steadfastly implements the directives of the 19th Congress of the Party on the Fifth Five-Year Plan and the resolutions of the July Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and has achieved certain successes in developing socialist industry, especially heavy industry. The industrial enterprises of the Republic basically completed the state tasks stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In five years, the total volume of products increased by 73%, and more than 100 enterprises were put into production. Compared with 1950, the mining of manganese increased by 61%, the mining of coal increased by 57%, electricity production increased by 61%, the production of metal-cutting machine tools increased by 56%, and the production of consumer goods for the people increased greatly.

In the recent two years, two blast furnaces, two coke ovens, a small rolling mill, and a plate rolling mill of the South Caucasus Stalin Metallurgical Plant have started operation. The Rustavi Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory has been put into production, and the first batch of construction projects of the Gori Cotton Textile Combine has been completed. Some new linkages and workshops have been put into operation in the Zestafoni Ferroalloy Factory, including a manganese refining and electrolysis workshop. The Shaorsk Hydropower Station has supplied electricity. The Kutaisi Automobile Factory has designed some new types of automobiles.

The Party organization of the Republic, following the historic resolutions of the Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on agricultural issues, has done some work in eliminating the shortcomings in collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. The machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms, strengthened with experienced and skilled cadres, have improved the Party’s political work in the countryside and strengthened the organizational activities of the Party’s rural district committees.

All these measures have promoted the organizational and economic consolidation of collective farms and the further growth of agricultural production. The cash income and public accumulation funds of collective farms have increased.

In 1955, collective farms achieved better results. For example, more than 117,000 tons of high-quality tea were sold to the state. In 1960, by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, we should harvest 160,000 tons of high-quality tea. The sales plan for grapes was completed by 100.3%, and the grain procurement plan was completed by 121%. Compared with 1954, more meat, milk, eggs, and wool were procured in 1955.

The Party organization of the Republic, implementing the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and subsequent meetings, has guided the staff members of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms to strive to improve animal husbandry.

Last year, collective farms achieved preliminary successes in improving the productivity of animal husbandry and increasing the production of animal husbandry products. In the past fiscal year, the total output of milk in collective farms increased by 50%. Certain work has also been carried out in the construction of silage buildings and strengthening the feed base of animal husbandry.

It should be pointed out that in this year, sheep overwintered well on winter pastures, and the overwintering of all livestock was completely satisfactory.

The Georgian people’s various achievements in economic and cultural construction should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. But we must never be satisfied with the achievements we have already obtained. The Party has taught us this. We should boldly expose the shortcomings and negligence in our work, resolutely oppose all manifestations of complacency and arrogance, constantly explore and utilize the potential in all sectors of the national economy, more extensively carry out socialist emulation, and deeply study and adopt the scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union and foreign countries in production.

In addition to the achievements, there are still significant shortcomings in the industry and agriculture of the Republic. Individual enterprises have not completed the 1955 product production plan. The resolution of the July Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on continuously striving for technological progress in industry has also not been well implemented.

There are still some collective farms, and even entire districts, in the Republic that have not satisfactorily completed the work of this agricultural year. Animal husbandry has still not become a highly productive and highly commercialized agricultural sector. The connection between the scientific research institutions of the Republic and industrial enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms is still weak.

All these shortcomings and negligence are mainly because: the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia, the Council of Ministers of the Republic, and the local Party and Soviet organs do not provide specific and effective leadership to industrial enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, have not resolutely carried out the struggle to explore untapped potential and improve labor productivity, and have not deeply studied the long-term problems of further improving the Republic’s economy.

Comrades! Comrade Khrushchev, in the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, justly criticized the Party organs, pointing out serious shortcomings in ideological work, pointing out that ideological work lags behind the tasks completed by our Party and is divorced from the reality of communist construction. This criticism is also completely suitable for the Party organization of Georgia.

The Party organization of the Republic has taken all measures to strengthen organizational and political work among the masses, directly in enterprises, collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations. They will improve the Party’s leadership of industry and agriculture, resolutely improve all ideological work, and closely link ideological work with the specific tasks of economic and cultural construction. The Party organization uses all its practical activities to solve the tasks of further improving the national economy, improving the material well-being and cultural level of the working people.

The draft directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union put forward new and huge tasks for the industry and agriculture of Georgia.

The total industrial output of the Republic should increase by approximately 1.6 times in five years. It is also stipulated that electricity production, pig iron smelting, and coal mining should be greatly increased. The Communists of Georgia and all the working people recognize the full complexity of the tasks facing our Republic and are filled with the absolute determination to successfully complete these tasks. We have every possibility to do this. The task lies in: improving the leadership of the Party and Soviet organs in economic and cultural construction, and organizing the implementation of the Congress’s directives.

Comrades! The Communist Party’s national policy is for the purpose of further strengthening the cooperation of socialist nations and for the prosperity of the economy, culture, and science of all fraternal republics. Comrade Khrushchev spoke extremely clearly about this in the summary report of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

The Party requires us to fully strengthen the solidarity and unbreakable friendship of all nationalities of the socialist motherland, because this is the foundation of the strength and power of our great country.

We should resolutely eliminate various manifestations of bourgeois nationalism hiding under any banner in the bud, and ruthlessly eradicate everything that opposes the friendship, unity, and affection of our nationalities.

The vile Beria gang attempted to undermine the unity and friendship of all nationalities in our great motherland. They attempted to undermine our internationalist close ties with the people’s democratic countries; they attempted to use terror, illegal acts, and intimidation to spread distrust among the people of all countries. They also dreamed of more, but fortunately, they were not able to realize it.

Comrades! It is difficult to say, and it is impossible to say clearly, how much pain and misfortune the vile Beria gang brought to the Georgian people. Dozens, hundreds of honest and extremely loyal Party and Soviet workers, science, culture, and art workers became victims of the treacherous conspiracies of this vile gang, who used intimidation, surveillance, and terror to achieve their evil goals. All these hindered normal work, produced flattering and fawning elements, and brought great losses to the work of the Party and Soviet organs.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union timely and resolutely stopped the evil activities of the conspirators and greatly helped us to eliminate the consequences of the hostile activities of this vile gang.

We should frankly announce to the Congress that after the famous measures of the Party and the government, the situation has greatly changed. A truly working and Party atmosphere has been established in all links of the Party, Soviet, and economic organs.

In this situation, everyone has the full possibility to loyally work for the welfare of his great motherland, and firmly believes that his honest labor and his title of Soviet citizen are protected by Soviet law, and at the same time, he firmly believes that all the strength of our beloved Communist Party is used to further improve the national economy, further consolidate the strength and power of our motherland, and improve the welfare and happiness of our people. (Applause)

Comrades! Before the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Party organization of Georgia held report and summary conferences, representative meetings, and the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of the Republic. These meetings were carried out very actively under the sign of mobilizing all forces to solve the national economic tasks facing the Republic.

At the 17th Congress of the Communist Party of Georgia, some major shortcomings in the work of the Central Committee of the Party of Georgia and the state, city, and district committees, Soviet and economic organs of the Republic were exposed. The Congress pointed out that the Party organization of Georgia will be able to eliminate these shortcomings in the near future and raise the Party’s organizational work and the Party’s mass work to the level of modern requirements.

Comrades! By the time of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Communist Party of Georgia was unprecedentedly united around the Leninist Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Communists of Georgia, all the working people, are prepared to unconditionally complete all the tasks of our beloved Communist Party and contribute all their strength, knowledge, and energy to the struggle for the complete victory of communism in our country!

Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party created by the talented and immortal Lenin, our people are confidently and irresistibly advancing towards the peak of communism! (Applause)

    姆扎瓦纳泽在苏共代表大会上的发言
    同志们！尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党中央委员会的总结报告中对我党的对外和对内政策作了全面而深刻的分析，向苏共第二十次代表大会报告了党在第十九次代表大会以后在中央委员会领导下所进行了的巨大工作。在总结报告中阐明了苏联共产党为争取共产主义在我国胜利而斗争的战斗纲领。可以有把握地说，无限忠诚于我们伟大的党的事业的苏联人民热烈赞成和拥护这个纲领，并且无疑地，一定会使它实现。
    党正在组织社会主义工业和农业的一切部门新的强大的高涨，正在实行着以进一步提高苏联人民物质福利和文化水平为目的的具体措施。
    共产党和苏联政府坚持不渝地实行着维护和巩固和平的政策，实行着国际合作和同一切国家发展事务联系的政策。这种政策表明苏联人民的根本利益，符合一切爱好和平的人民的期望。
    从中央委员会的总结报告中，从社会主义建设的全部实践中（我们是这些建设的参加者），可以得出一个结论，就是在报告所涉及的时期内，我们的党在对内和对外政策方面都达到了新的历史意义的胜利。全体苏联人民、共产党员和非党人士、劳动者和科学工作者都全心全意地赞同并且用自己的劳动事业积极支持共产党的英明政策，坚决地相信我们的中央委员会一定会英明、大胆、坚定和有把握地领导苏联人民成功地实现我国的共产主义建设纲领。（掌声）
    同志们！召开党的第二十次代表大会的决定引起了格鲁吉亚人民的巨大的政治和劳动热情。共和国的劳动人民广泛地开展了社会主义竞赛迎接党的第二十次代表大会，并且达到了新的劳动成就。这是我们党的巨大威望和苏联人民对它的无限忠诚的显明标志。
    格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的劳动人民热烈地赞同苏共第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案，把它看作是党和它的中央委员会无限关怀我们伟大苏联所有的民族共和国的经济和文化的进一步繁荣的新的鲜明表现。
    格鲁吉亚人民在苏联各族人民的友爱大家庭中富有成效地劳动着。格鲁吉亚劳动人民在经济和文化建设中的成就真正是巨大的。由于共产党和苏联政府的经常关怀，格鲁吉亚变成了一个繁荣的共和国。社会主义工业和多部门的农业一年一年顺利地发展起来，这些工业和农业用先进的本国机器装备起来。格鲁吉亚丰富的文化一年一年地繁荣和发展着。在共和国内培养了大批能够顺利解决共产主义建设任务的民族的科学和文化干部。
    格鲁吉亚人民，也像苏联各族人民一样，在自己的多年经验中深信共产党除了人民的利益以外没有其他的利益，深信我们党的目的是伟大和崇高的。
    格鲁吉亚人民清楚地了解，政治、经济和文化生活方面的卓越成绩，只有在苏维埃制度的条件下和由于各族人民的牢不可破的友谊才成为可能。各族人民的牢不可破的友谊是他们繁荣和幸福的可靠基础。
    格鲁吉亚的党组织坚定地实现党的第十九次代表大会对第五个五年计划的指示和苏联共产党中央委员会七月全会的决议，在发展社会主义工业，首先是重工业方面达到了某些成就。共和国的工业企业基本上提前完成了第五个五年计划规定的国家的任务。在5年当中，产品总量增加了73％，有100个以上的企业投入生产。1955年同1950年相比，锰的开采量增加了61％，煤的开采量增加了57％，电力生产增加了61％，金属加工机床的产量增加了56％，人民消费品的生产大大地增加了。
    在最近两年中，南高加索斯大林冶金工厂的两座高炉，两座炼焦炉、一台小型轧钢机和一台轧板机开工了。鲁斯塔维氮肥工厂投入了生产，哥里棉织联合工厂的第一批建筑工程完工了。泽斯塔弗尼铁合金工厂中一些新的联动机和车间开工了，其中有锰的精炼和电解车间。绍尔斯克水力发电站供电了。库塔伊锡汽车工厂设计了一些新型的汽车。
    共和国的党组织遵循着苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议关于农业问题的历史性的决议，在消灭集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中的缺点方面作了一些工作。用被有经验的、熟练的干部加强了的机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄改善了农村中的党的政治工作，加强了党的农村区委会的组织活动。
    所有这些措施都促进了集体农庄的组织上和经济上的巩固和农产品生产的进一步增长。集体农庄的现金收入和公积金增加了。
    1955年，集体农庄得到了较好的成绩。例如，交售给国家117，000吨以上的上等茶叶。在1960年，即到第六个五年计划结束的时候，我们应当采16万吨上等茶叶。葡萄的交售计划完成了100.3％，粮食采购计划完成了121％。1955年同1954年相比，采购了更多的肉类、牛奶、鸡蛋和羊毛。
    共和国的党组织实现苏联共产党中央委员会九月全会和以后几次会议的决议，引导集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员努力提高畜牧业。
    去年，集体农庄在提高畜牧业产品率和增加畜牧业产品的生产方面达到了初步成就。在过去的一个业务年度里，集体农庄牛奶的总产量整个增加了50％。在建设青贮饲料建筑物和加强畜牧业的饲料基地方面也进行了一定的工作。
    应当指出，在这一年里，绵羊很好地在冬季牧场上过冬，全部牲畜的过冬情况都是完全令人满意的。
    格鲁吉亚人民之所以在经济和文化建设方面获得各种成绩，应当归功于苏联共产党中央委员会的英明领导。但是我们决不能满足已经得到的成绩。党教导了我们这一点。应当大胆地揭露工作中的缺点和疏忽，坚决地反对沾沾自喜和自高自大的各种表现，不断地发掘和运用国民经济各部门中的潜力，更广泛地开展社会主义竞赛，深刻地研究和在生产中采用苏联和外国的科学和技术成就。
    共和国的工业和农业除去获得的成绩以外，依然存在着重大的缺点。个别企业没有完成1955年的产品生产计划。苏联共产党中央7月全会关于不断地争取工业的技术进步的决议也执行得不好。
    共和国仍然有一些集体农庄、甚至整个区没有令人满意地完成这一农业年度的工作。畜牧业仍然没有成为产品率高的和商品率高的农业部门。共和国的科学研究机关同工业企业、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的联系仍然薄弱。
    所有这些缺点和疏忽主要是因为：格鲁吉亚共产党中央委员会、共和国部长会议、地方党的和苏维埃机关对工业企业、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导不够具体和有效，没有坚决地进行争取发掘未加利用的潜力和提高劳动生产率的斗争，没有深刻地研究进一步提高共和国经济的远景问题。
    同志们！赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党中央委员会的报告中公正地批评了党的机关，他指出了思想工作中的严重缺点，指出了思想工作落后于我党所完成的任务，脱离了共产主义建设的实际。这一批评对格鲁吉亚的党组织也是完全适合的。
    共和国的党组织采取了一切措施来加强在群众中、直接在企业、集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的组织工作和政治工作，它们将改善党对工农业的领导，坚决地改善全部思想工作，并把思想工作和经济文化建设的具体任务紧密地联系起来。党组织把自己的全部实际活动都用来解决进一步提高国民经济、提高劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平的任务。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于苏联的发展国民经济第六个五年计划的指示草案为格鲁吉亚的工业和农业提出了新的巨大的任务。
    共和国的全部工业产品总额在五年之中大约应当增加到一点六倍。也规定了大大提高电力生产、生铁熔铸量和煤的开采量。格鲁吉亚的共产党员和全体劳动人民都认识到摆在我们共和国面前的任务的全部复杂性，并充满了绝对保证胜利完成这些任务的决心。我们是有一切可能作到这一点的。任务在于：改善党和苏维埃机关对经济和文化建设的领导，组织实现代表大会的指示。
    同志们！共产党的民族政策是为了进一步加强社会主义各民族的合作，为了各兄弟共和国的经济、文化和科学的繁荣。赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共中央委员会的总结报告中极明确地谈到了这一点。
    党要求全力加强社会主义祖国各民族的团结一致和牢不可破的友谊，因为这是我们伟大国家的力量和威力的基础。
    应当在萌芽的时候就坚决地消除那些掩藏在任何旗帜之下的资产阶级民族主义的各种表现，应当无情地铲除那些反对我们各民族的友谊、团结和亲爱的一切东西。
    卑鄙的贝利亚匪帮曾企图破坏我们伟大祖国各民族的团结和友谊。他们曾企图破坏我们同各人民民主国家的国际主义的亲密联系；他们曾企图用恐怖、非法行为、恫吓的手段在各国人民之间散布不信任。他们也曾幻想过更多的，但是，幸而他们没有能够实现。
    同志们！很难说，而且也无法说清卑鄙的贝利亚匪帮使格鲁吉亚人民遭到了多少痛苦和不幸。几十个、几百个诚实的和极其忠实于党和人民的党和苏维埃的工作人员、科学、文化和艺术工作人员成了这个卑鄙的匪帮的狡诈阴谋的牺牲者，这个卑鄙的匪帮为了达到自己的罪恶目的，曾使用恫吓、监视和恐怖的方法。所有这些都妨害了正常的工作，产生了阿谀和谄媚的分子，给党和苏维埃机关的工作带来了巨大的损失。
    苏联共产党中央委员会适时地和坚决地阻止住了阴谋家的罪恶活动，并且大力帮助我们铲除这个卑鄙匪帮的敌对活动的后果。
    应当坦白地向代表大会宣布，在党和政府的有名的措施以后，情况已经大大地改变了。在党、苏维埃和经济机关的一切环节里建立起了真正的工作的和党的环境。
    在这种情况下，每一个人有充分的可能为自己的伟大祖国的福利而忠诚地劳动，并且坚信他的正直劳动、他的苏联公民的称号受到苏联法律的保护，同时并且坚信我们亲爱的共产党的全部力量都是用来进一步提高国民经济，进一步巩固我们祖国的力量和威力，提高我们的人民的福利和幸福。（掌声）
    同志们！在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以前，格鲁吉亚的党组织举行了报告总结大会、代表会议和共和国共产党第十七次代表大会。这些会议是在动员一切力量解决摆在共和国面前的国民经济任务的标志下非常积极地进行的。
    在格鲁吉亚共产党第十七次代表大会上揭露了格鲁吉亚党中央委员会和共和国的州委会、市委会、区委会、苏维埃和经济机关工作中的一些重大缺点。代表大会指出，格鲁吉亚党组织能够在最近时期内消除这些缺点，并且把党的组织工作和党的群众工作提高到现代要求的水平。
    同志们！到苏共第二十次代表大会的时候，格鲁吉亚共产党是空前地团结在苏联共产党列宁式的中央委员会的周围的。格鲁吉亚的共产党员、全体劳动人民准备无条件地完成我们亲爱的共产党的全部任务，并且把全部力量、知识和精力贡献给争取共产主义在我国完全胜利的斗争！
    在天才的、不朽的列宁所创造的布尔什维克党的领导下，我国人民正满怀信心地和势不可挡地向共产主义的高峰前进！（掌声）　（原载2月18日苏联“真理报”）（新华社）
