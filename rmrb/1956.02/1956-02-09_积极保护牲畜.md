    Actively Protect Livestock
    Ru Gao County, Jiangsu Province, organized social veterinarians, cattle market traders, district and township food purchasing personnel, agricultural cooperative livestock veterinary technicians, and livestock veterinary station staff to go deep into the households of farmers, inspect and promote winter livestock protection work. They conducted a general inspection of the health and wintering conditions of cattle, pigs, and goats throughout the county. They helped and urged farmers to repair livestock sheds, prepare fodder, improve feeding management methods, and provide treatment for sick livestock. In the Matang and Chengxi districts, the first inspection alone led farmers to repair 7,886 cattle sheds and prepare sufficient winter and spring fodder for 3,350 head of cattle. Ru Gao County also plans to organize all the veterinarians in the county, divide them into regions to take charge, and do a good job in livestock disease prevention and control.
    In the past, Ru Gao County had also issued notices, posted announcements, and held meetings for livestock protection work, but the effect was not significant. This time, by mobilizing forces from all sides and conducting in-depth work, many problems were solved, and livestock protection work was promoted.

    积极保护牲畜
    江苏省如皋县组织了社会兽医、牛市场交易员、区乡食品收购人员、农业合作社的畜牧兽医技术员和畜牧兽医站的工作人员，深入各农户，检查并推动冬季保护牲畜工作，对全县的牛、猪、山羊的健康状况和过冬情况进行了普遍的检查。他们帮助和推动农民修理畜舍、筹备草料、改善饲养管理方法，替有病的牲畜进行治疗。马塘和城西两个区，通过第一次检查，就带动农民修好了7，886座牛舍，筹足了3，350头耕牛的冬春草料。如皋县还准备把全县的兽医组织起来，按地区划片包干，做好牲畜疾病防治工作。
    过去，如皋县为了保畜工作，也发过通知，贴过布告，开过会，但是效果不大；这次发动了各方面的力量，深入地进行工作，就解决了不少问题，推动了保畜工作。
