Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 18th: Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Kunio Morishita stated on February 18th in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that the Japanese government had submitted the resolutions on banning atomic weapons tests, unanimously passed by both houses of the Japanese Diet, to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom respectively, and had received responses.

    Morishita said that when the Japanese government submitted the Diet's resolution to Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Sobolev, requesting him to forward it to the Soviet government, Sobolev immediately stated: "The Soviet Union has consistently and enthusiastically advocated for the prohibition of such tests, and we express our sympathy for this resolution. The Soviet government will undoubtedly be pleased to welcome (this resolution)."
    Morishita spoke of the U.S. government’s reaction to the Japanese Diet’s resolution, saying that Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy stated that while the United States was willing to "carefully study" Japan's proposal to ban atomic weapons tests, the United States considered it a "difficult problem." At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's response to the Japanese proposal was merely: "We are well aware of this request."

    苏联支持日本国会关于禁止原子武器试验的决议
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本外务省次官森下国雄2月18日在众议院外务委员会上说，日本政府已经把日本国会参众两院一致通过的关于禁止原子武器试验的决议分别送交苏联、美国和英国政府，并且得到了反应。
    森下说，当日本政府把国会的决议送交苏联驻美国大使索波列夫请他转交苏联政府时，索波列夫当场表示：“苏联是一贯热心地主张禁止这种试验，我们对这个决议表示同情。苏联政府（对这个决议）无疑会高兴地表示欢迎。”
    森下谈到美国政府对日本国会的决议的反应时说，美国副国务卿帮办墨菲表示，美国虽然愿意“慎重研究”日本的禁止试验原子武器的建议，但是美国认为这是一个“困难问题”。同时，英国外相劳埃德对日本的建议的回答仅仅是：“我们很了解这个要求”。
