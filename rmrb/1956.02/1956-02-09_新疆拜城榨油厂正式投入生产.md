The production process of this oil mill, from feeding to oil extraction, is all operated by machinery, so the oil extraction rate is very high. Every hundred catties of oilseeds can produce 6 more catties of oil than using traditional methods.

    新疆拜城榨油厂正式投入生产
    新疆省地方国营拜城榨油厂已经建成并正式投入生产。这个榨油厂的生产过程，从进料到出油全部都是用机器操作的，因此出油率很高，每百斤油籽比用土法榨制可多出6斤油。
