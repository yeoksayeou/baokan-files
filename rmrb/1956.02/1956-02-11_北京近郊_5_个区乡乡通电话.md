    Telephone service has been extended to all townships in the 5 suburban districts of Beijing as of the 9th. Among them, the Shijingshan District has also installed conference call facilities. The telephone installation project in the Jingxi Mining Area is also underway. By the end of March, the telephone network between all districts and townships in the entire suburbs will be fully established. In the future, wired broadcasting can also be installed using the same poles and lines.
    The workers involved in the telephone installation worked in spite of the severe cold. Suburban farmers actively helped the engineering teams transport equipment and dig holes for planting telephone poles. The Beijing Municipal Telephone Engineering Team of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing also dispatched a large number of personnel to help with the telephone installation.

    北京近郊5个区乡乡通电话
    9日，北京市近郊的5个区已经乡乡通电话，其中石景山区还安装好了会议电话。京西矿区安装电话工程也正在进行。到3月底，全郊区区乡之间的电话网就可以全部建立起来。将来还可以利用同杆同线安装有线广播。
    参加安装电话的工人，冒着严寒进行安装。郊区农民都主动为工程队运器材，挖栽电线杆的坑。邮电部市话工程总队和中国人民解放军驻京部队也曾抽出大批人力帮助安装电话。
