Where does Britain stand in the current world situation? What are the prospects for the British people in the coming year?

Undoubtedly, at the Geneva Four-Power Summit last summer, Britain had a golden opportunity to advocate a policy of peace, one that would reduce dependence on the United States, lessen the burden of armaments, and open up new avenues of trade with the non-dollar world.

But in the months since the Geneva Summit last summer, the British Conservative government, with the support of the right-wing Labour leaders, has let these opportunities slip through its fingers, choosing instead a different and disastrous path. Macmillan played the role of the most reactionary mouthpiece of Conservative policy at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, deliberately undermining the favorable possibilities offered by the Geneva Summit. Following Prime Minister Eden's beneficial initiative in inviting Chairman Bulganin and First Secretary Khrushchev to visit Britain this spring, came the decision to hold unilateral talks with Eisenhower in Washington, seeking to coordinate US-British policies in all areas before the Soviet leaders' visit. In the Middle East, Britain has pursued an aggressive strategy of establishing the Baghdad Military Pact, an action that has aroused the just anger and resentment of all Arab peoples, as is particularly evident in Egypt's attitude and the wave of indignation in Jordan. The Conservative government, also with the support of the Labour Party's powerful faction, is expanding the colonial war in Malaya, ignoring the Malayan people's demands for a peaceful settlement through negotiation; the same is true in Kenya, while in Cyprus, a terrifying military regime has been established. The Conservative government is committed to manufacturing and testing its first hydrogen bomb, rejecting all proposals to ban nuclear weapons or even to ban further testing of nuclear weapons.

The disastrous consequences of this policy are already evident in the economic sphere. The deficit in the balance of payments reappeared in 1955. The trade deficit for that year increased by £265 million over the previous year, reaching £864 million. Gold and dollar reserves decreased by £279 million, leaving only £757 million. Inflation and rising prices have severely affected the people's living standards. Butler's emergency budget last autumn already increased taxes on daily consumer goods. Rents are rising. There is a risk that the budget to be presented in April will implement further attacks on the people's living standards.

Discontent with this situation has been expressed among people of all strata. Within the Conservative Party, the most reactionary factions have launched noisy campaigns against Eden's leadership. Bankers and big industrialists have demanded a more aggressive policy towards trade unions and living standards, and openly clamored for an end to full employment and the establishment of a "reservoir of unemployment." The reshuffling of the Eden government has not quelled the dissatisfaction within the Conservative Party.

Within the working class, the fighting spirit of the vast majority of workers continues to strengthen. At the beginning of this year, 9 million workers have put forward demands for wage increases. The strength and fighting spirit of organized workers have made the Eden government hesitate in the face of demands from bankers and big industrialists for a complete showdown with the organized working class, preferring to adopt a more gradual policy of progressive attack.

The policy struggle within the Labour movement has reached new heights, reflecting the current crisis in the Labour Party since its election defeat last spring. At the Labour Party's Margate conference last year, the widespread demands of grassroots members for a more militant policy in peace and social affairs were stifled by the right-wing leadership. The appointment of Gaitskell as leader of the Labour Party at the end of last year, succeeding Attlee, was an offensive by the Labour Party's right-wing leadership group, aimed at opposing the growing left-wing movement among ordinary Labour Party members. Major Conservative newspapers, such as the "Daily Mirror" and the "Daily Telegraph," have openly praised Gaitskell as a "Conservative socialist," a "liberal Conservative," or a formidable enemy of socialism. Other official newspapers, such as "The Times" and "The Economist," expressed concern that Gaitskell's lack of a foundation in the Labour movement might make it difficult to suppress the left-wing rebellion.

Although it is widely believed that the similarity between the official policies of the Conservative and Labour parties was the main reason for the Labour Party's defeat in the last election, the Labour Party's official policy continues to support all the main policies of the Conservative government, while putting on a show of heavy criticism and "opposition" on some unimportant secondary issues. (Fiercely criticizing the sale of a little outdated military equipment to Egypt, which refused to join the Baghdad Military Pact, while remaining silent on the Baghdad Military Pact and the delivery of large quantities of weapons to the Baghdad Treaty member countries.) During this period, the Bevan group mostly remained silent. Bevan himself ran against Gaitskell for the leadership of the Labour Party, receiving 70 votes from Labour MPs, while Gaitskell received 156 votes. But he did not fight against the powerful right wing on some important policy issues.

The left-wing struggle continues to develop in the main aspects of the following movements, especially in factories and trade unions, as well as in local Labour Party organizations, in the tenants' movement against rent increases, and in the peace movement. The Communist Party has taken a leading role in expanding the united struggle to defend the people's living standards and fight for peace. Bourgeois newspapers have expressed great concern about the Communist Party's growing influence in trade unions and factories.

The current situation in Britain cannot but lead to sharp conflicts and shifts in policy, as well as a deepening of the Labour Party's crisis. The Washington talks between Eden and Eisenhower, under the guise of a joint declaration hostile to the Soviet Union and the peace camp, still reflect sharp contradictions between the US and Britain on the Middle East, atomic energy, relations with China, and other issues. The reaction of all Asian peoples to the Soviet leaders' visit to India and South Asia, and the sweeping actions of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the European People's Democracies in assisting the development of the economies of countries previously oppressed and made backward by imperialism, have made a deep impression on British officials, leading more people to recognize that if Britain's policies are to adapt to the new world situation, new shifts must be implemented. Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev have scheduled a visit to Britain in April this year, and unless prevented by the pressure of US and British reactionaries, this visit will undoubtedly provide an opportunity for very important consultations.

The key to Britain's future progress lies first and foremost in the development of progressive forces in the Labour movement, in uniting the masses of the people around the leadership of the Communist Party, and in striving for a united struggle against the Conservative Party's offensive and war policies, so as to replace this policy with a peaceful policy that conforms to the main interests of the people. The forthcoming 24th Congress of the Communist Party will have the important task of promoting the entire struggle to achieve the above goals, to defend the living standards and interests of the British people, and to fight for peace, independence, and socialism.

### 英国何处去

    英国何处去
    英国共产党副主席　杜德
    英国在目前的世界局势中扮演着什么样的角色呢？英国人民未来一年的前景怎么样呢？
    毫无疑问，在去年夏天举行的日内瓦四国政府首脑会议中，英国的面前是有着倡导采取和平政策的大好机会的，这种政策就是减少对美国的依赖，减轻军备负担以及同非美元世界打开贸易的新道路。
    但是在去年夏天日内瓦会议结束后的几个月以来，英国保守党政府在工党右翼领袖的支持下，白白放过了这些机会，而选择了另外一条不同的、灾难性的途径。麦克米伦在外长会议上扮演了保守党政策最反动的喉舌的角色，而故意破坏了日内瓦政府首脑会议所提供的有利的可能性。在艾登首相邀请布尔加宁主席和赫鲁晓夫第一书记在今年春天访问英国的有益倡议之后，却紧接着是决定同艾森豪威尔在华盛顿举行片面会谈，以图在苏联领袖访问之前，首先就美英在各方面的政策协调一致。在中东，英国推行了建立巴格达军事条约的侵略性策略，这种行径已引起了一切阿拉伯的人民的正当愤怒和痛恨，这特别明显地表现在埃及的态度和约旦的怒潮中。保守党政府同样是在工党当权派的支持下，在马来亚扩大殖民战争，玩忽马来亚人民主张通过协商谋求和平的要求；在怯尼亚也是如此，而在塞浦路斯则设立了一个恐怖的军事政权。保守党政府致力于制造和试验第一个氢弹，而拒绝了一切禁止核子武器和甚至禁止继续试验核子武器的建议。
    这种政策的灾难性结果已在经济领域中显露出来。国际收支的赤字在1955年又重新出现。这一年的贸易逆差比前一年增加了26，500万镑，而达到了86，400万镑。黄金和美元储备减少了27，900万镑，而只剩下了75，700万镑。通货膨胀和货物上涨严重地影响到人民的生活水平。巴特勒去年秋天拿出来的紧急预算已经给日用消费品加重了捐税。房租正在提高。将在4月份提出的预算中并有对人民生活水平实行进一步的进攻之虞。
    在各阶层人民中间都已表现出对这种局面的不满情绪。在保守党内部，最反动的派别曾发动了大吵大闹的运动来反对艾登的领导。银行家和大工业家要求对工会组织和生活水平采取一种更富于进攻性的政策，并且公开嚷叫要求停止充分就业而建立一个“失业的蓄水池”。艾登政府的改组并没有平息保守党内部的不满。
    在工人阶级内部，极大部分工人的战斗意志继续增强。今年年初900万工人已提出增加工资的要求。有组织的工人的力量和斗志已使得艾登政府目前面对着银行家和大工业家要求同有组织的工人阶级进行一场完全属于摊牌性质的战斗而犹豫不决，宁愿采取一种比较渐进的逐步进攻的政策。
    在工党运动内部的政策斗争达到了新的高峰，这反映在工党自从去年春天选举失败以来而发生的目前的危机中。在工党的马尔加特年会上，基层党员主张在和平和社会事业中采取更富于战斗性的政策的普遍要求，竟被右翼领导所窒息。去年年底，盖茨克尔被任命继艾德礼为工党领袖一举，是工党右翼领导集团的一个进攻，其目的，是要反对在工党普通党员中所日益增长的左翼运动。主要的保守党机关报，像“每日镜报”和“每日电讯报”都曾公开赞誉盖茨克尔为“保守党的社会主义者”、“自由的保守党员”或者社会主义的劲敌。像“泰晤士报”和“经济学家”等其他的官方的机关报则表示担心盖茨克尔在工党运动中没有根基是否能够压制得了左翼的反叛。
    虽然人们普遍认为保守党和工党官方政策的酷似是工党在上届选举中败北的主要原因，但是工党的官方政策还继续在推行，以支持保守党政府所有的主要政策，而在一些无关重要的次等问题上则装出了大加批评和“反对派”的在野党的样子。（激烈批评输给拒绝参加巴格达军事条约的埃及一点陈旧的军火，而对巴格达军事条约和输送大批武器给巴格达条约缔约国的事情则默不作声。）在这个期间比万集团大半是保持沉默。比万自己出来同盖茨克尔竞选工党领袖，得到了70个工党议员的票，而盖茨克尔得到了156票。但是他在一些重要的政策问题上并没有同有势力的右翼进行斗争。
    左翼的战斗在下列几个运动的主要方面继续发展，特别是在工厂和工会中，同时也在工党的地方组织中，在房客反对增加房租的运动中，以及在和平运动中。共产党在扩展为保卫人民生活水平和争取和平的统一斗争中担任了领导的角色。资产阶级报纸已对共产党在工会中和在工厂中日益增加的影响表示十分关心。
    英国当前的局势，不能不引起在政策上的尖锐冲突和转变，同时也引起工党危机的加深。艾登和艾森豪威尔的华盛顿会谈，在敌视苏联和和平阵营的联合宣言的掩盖底下，还是反映出了美英之间在中东问题、原子能问题和对中国的关系问题以及其他问题上的尖锐矛盾。一切亚洲人民对苏联领袖访问印度和南亚的反应以及苏联、中华人民共和国和欧洲人民民主国家在援助过去被帝国主义压迫和造成落后的国家发展经济方面的大刀阔斧的做法，已在英国官方人士中产生了深刻的印象，而使得更多人承认如果英国的政策要适应新的世界局势就必需实行新的转变。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫同志已拟定在今年4月访问英国，只要不是为美国和英国反动派的压力所阻，这次访问无疑将会提供举行十分重要的协商的机会。
    英国的未来的进展的关键，首先在于工党运动中的进步力量的发展，在于把人民群众团结在共产党领导的周围，争取进行反对保守党的攻势和战争政策的联合斗争，以便用一种符合人民的主要利益的和平政策来代替这种政策。未来的共产党第二十四届大会将负有推动整个斗争的重要任务，这个斗争是为了实现上述的目标，为了保卫英国人民群众的生活水平和利益，以及为了争取和平、独立和社会主义。
