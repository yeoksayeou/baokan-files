    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and fully agree with the reports made by Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, and Committee Member Chen Boda. Now, I would like to make some remarks on the socialist transformation of handicrafts.
    Currently, the cooperative transformation of handicrafts has become an integral part of the overall socialist transformation upsurge, forming a magnificent and powerful mass movement. More than sixty cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, have fully realized the cooperative transformation of handicrafts simultaneously with the complete implementation of joint state-private ownership in private industrial and commercial enterprises and the complete realization of agricultural cooperation in suburban areas. This is a great victory of decisive significance for the Chinese people in the socialist revolution.
    As Chairman Zhou Enlai said, China's handicrafts "are very developed and occupy an important position in the national economy. They are a powerful assistant to modern industry and play an active role in serving the needs of the country and the people." However, under the long-term dark rule of the old society, the vast number of handicraft laborers had no guarantee of production, and their lives were in extreme hardship.
    The great victory of the people's revolution in 1949 brought a bright and splendid future to the development of China's national economy and also to the development of handicraft production. The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao had long put forward the brilliant policy of individual economy taking the road of cooperation. With the promulgation of the general task for the transition period, the enthusiasm of the vast number of handicraft laborers across the country to take the socialist road was greatly encouraged. By the end of 1955, more than 2 million people across the country had organized more than 70,000 handicraft production cooperatives, supply and marketing production cooperatives, and production teams, accounting for more than 25% of the total number of individual handicraft practitioners nationwide; the total annual output value was 2 billion yuan, accounting for about 27% of the total output value of individual handicrafts. Among them, there were more than 20,000 production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature, with members accounting for more than 40% of the total number of people organized, and the output value accounting for 63%. More than 80% of these cooperatives (teams) are good and solid, and the rest can also stand on their own feet. In particular, after the general rectification in 1955, the socialist consciousness of the members was generally improved, democratic management was strengthened, production was increased, product quality was improved, product costs were reduced, public accumulation was expanded, and the lives of the members were improved. Some cooperatives, relying on the accumulation of their own funds and state assistance, have carried out preliminary technological transformations, becoming semi-mechanized or mechanized cooperative factories. These facts clearly show the superiority of being organized, not only making the existing cooperatives continue to be consolidated and developed, but also a huge force and living example attracting individual handicraft laborers to actively take the socialist road.
    The direction of handicraft production is to face the countryside, serve agricultural production, and at the same time serve the needs of urban and rural people's lives, national industrial construction, and export needs. According to statistics from 21 provinces and cities in 1955, handicraft cooperatives (teams) supplied farmers with more than 100.8 million pieces of various agricultural tools. Incomplete statistics from four provinces, including Hebei and Henan, show that handicraft cooperatives (teams) established more than 3,000 agricultural tool repair stations and repair teams, repairing more than 2 million pieces of various agricultural tools for farmers. Among the total output value of handicrafts, means of production account for 18%, and means of livelihood account for 82%. About 60%-70% of the daily industrial products needed by the vast number of farmers are handicraft products. Since liberation, China's highly skilled and richly diverse special crafts have also been greatly developed and improved.
    Since the publication of Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, the enthusiasm of the vast majority of handicraft laborers to take the socialist road has been unprecedentedly high, old cooperatives are constantly expanding, new cooperatives are being established in batches, cooperatives lead teams, teams transform into cooperatives, industries connect industries, old cooperatives lead new cooperatives, organization leads individuals, and all conditions have reached the point of "ripe melon falling off the vine" and "water flowing into a canal." According to preliminary statistics at the end of January, handicrafts in most cities and many counties across the country have fully realized cooperation, and the number of people organized has reached more than 50% of the total number of individual handicraft workers nationwide. The speed of socialist transformation of handicrafts has been greatly accelerated compared with the original planned targets. On the basis of the cooperative upsurge, some areas have also set off a production upsurge. For example, many newly built handicraft cooperatives in Beijing have started labor competitions. Many handicraft laborers with specialized skills in Anyang City, Henan Province, have taught their skills, which they had refused to disclose for many years, to the members.
    Because China's handicrafts have a large number of people, complex industries, wide distribution, and different social and economic natures, they have close ties with industry, agriculture, commerce, and other aspects. Therefore, the socialist transformation and technological transformation of handicrafts must fully utilize the existing possible conditions under the principle of "overall planning and strengthened leadership," continue to overcome conservative and backward thinking, formulate positive and reliable overall plans, and take effective measures so that this transformation can develop forward in accordance with the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.
    The current central task is to continue to complete the organizational task of handicraft cooperation. For handicraft laborers who have not yet been organized, it is necessary to conduct in-depth socialist education and articles of association education. Under the principle of voluntariness, either organize them all by industry, or organize them in stages and batches, so as to be fast without chaos. For certain repair industries, service industries, and special handicrafts that are not easy to organize into cooperatives for the time being, do not force them to organize, let them continue to work independently, but should help them solve difficulties in supply and marketing and help them improve technically. For the cooperatives that have already been organized, all industries that are not suitable for centralized production should maintain the form of decentralized production. Even for industries that are suitable for centralized production, preparations should be made before centralized production is carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. After the establishment of the cooperative, the original supply and marketing relationship cannot be broken, but should be expanded; the original product quality cannot be reduced, but should be improved; the original product variety cannot be reduced, but should be increased. The original stores and service points cannot be easily abolished. A small number of unreasonable ones should be gradually adjusted after investigation and research. For scattered and sporadic repair industries and service industries, not only should they not be reduced, but they should also give full play to their advantages of going from street to street and providing on-site production to better serve the residents. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of the members, do a good job in unity, establish a leading core, properly handle specific issues such as tool depreciation and share payment, gradually change production relations, establish necessary and feasible management systems, carry out consolidation and improvement work in a timely manner, and constantly overcome the capitalist management ideas and styles brought about by small-scale production.
    The purpose of the socialist transformation of handicrafts is to liberate the productive forces. From individual to organized, from decentralized production to centralized production (referring to industries suitable for centralized production), from handicraft operation to the gradual realization of semi-mechanized and mechanized production (referring to industries that can be mechanized), there is great potential to be tapped. Chairman Zhou Enlai's instruction to "incorporate the supply, production, and sales plans of handicrafts into the national, especially local, industrial plans as much as possible" is very correct. Only on the basis of national balance and local balance, can we fully utilize local raw materials, adapt to local needs, develop production, improve technology, and manufacture products with better quality, more varieties, newer designs, and cheaper prices, so as to better meet the growing needs of urban and rural people in production and life, and actively play the role of handicraft cooperatives as an assistant to state-owned industries.
    Many of China's handicraft products are special crafts, such as carving, embroidery, lace, brocade, carpets, cloisonné enamelware, bodiless lacquerware, etc., which enjoy a high reputation at home and abroad. This is the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese working people and the pride of the nation. These special crafts must be preserved, developed, and improved; the old artists who produce special crafts must be strengthened in unity and education, and given care in life, so as to give full play to their wisdom and expertise, encourage them to pass on their skills, train young artists, and create new works of art, but this is not enough, we also need to actively and greatly cultivate high-level arts and crafts talents to meet the needs of the development and improvement of arts and crafts.
    Handicraft cooperatives are a socialist collective ownership economy. On the premise of improving labor productivity, we must gradually improve the material and cultural life of the members, improve working conditions, and run labor insurance, cultural schools, clinics, sanatoriums, nurseries, reading rooms, clubs, and sports teams to gradually get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity together with the people of the whole country.
    The socialist transformation of handicrafts is a great change. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the help of state-owned industries and other relevant departments, we will surely be able to victoriously complete this glorious task ahead of schedule.

    白如冰的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，完全同意李济深副主席、郭沫若副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武副主席和陈伯达委员所做的报告。现在，我想对手工业社会主义改造工作，作一些发言。
    当前，手工业合作化已经成为整个社会主义改造高潮中的一个组成部分，已经形成一个规模壮阔、声势浩大的群众运动。北京、天津、上海等六十多个城市，在私营工商业全部实行公私合营和郊区农业全部实现合作化的同时，手工业也全部实现了合作化。这是我国人民在社会主义革命中具有决定意义的伟大胜利。
    我国手工业，正如周恩来主席所说，“是很发达的，在国民经济中占有重要地位。它们是现代工业的有力助手，在为国家和人民的需要服务方面起着积极的作用。”但在旧社会的长期黑暗统治下，广大手工业劳动者，生产毫无保障，生活处于极端困苦的境地。
    1949年人民革命的伟大胜利，给我国国民经济的发展，也给手工业生产的发展带来了光辉灿烂的前程。中国共产党和毛主席早就提出了个体经济走合作化道路的英明政策，随着国家过渡时期总任务的公布，大大地鼓舞了全国广大手工业劳动者走社会主义道路的积极性。截至1955年底，全国已经有200多万人组织了7万多个手工业生产合作社、供销生产社和生产小组，约占全国个体手工业从业人员的25％以上；全年生产总值20亿元，约占个体手工业总产值的27％。其中完全社会主义性质的生产合作社2万多个，社员占组织起来总人数的40％强，产值占63％。这些合作社（组）80％以上是好的、巩固的，其余的也都能站住脚。特别是经过1955年的普遍整顿以后，一般都提高了社员的社会主义觉悟，加强了民主管理，增加了生产，提高了产品质量，降低了产品成本，扩大了公共积累，改善了社员生活。有些合作社并依靠自有资金的积累和国家援助，进行了初步的技术改造，成为半机械化或机械化的合作工厂。这些事实清楚地显示了组织起来的优越性，不仅使现有的合作社不断得到巩固和发展，而且也是吸引个体手工业劳动者积极走向社会主义道路的巨大力量和活的榜样。
    手工业生产的方向是面向农村，为农业生产服务，同时为城乡人民生活需要、国家工业建设和出口需要服务。据1955年21个省、市的统计，手工业合作社（组）供应农民的各式农具，即达10，080多万件。河北、河南等四个省不完全统计，手工业合作社（组）共建立了3，000多个农具修配站和修配小组，为农民修配各式农具达200多万件。手工业总产值中，生产资料占18％，生活资料占82％。广大农民所需要的日用工业品约有60％—70％是手工业产品。解放以来，我国技艺高超、丰富多采的特种工艺品，也有了很大的发展和提高。
    从毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中共七届六中全会（扩大）决议发表以后，绝大多数手工业劳动者走社会主义道路的积极性空前提高，老社正在不断地扩大，新社正在成批地建立，社带组、组转社、行业串行业、老社带新社、组织起来带个体，一切条件均已达到“瓜熟蒂落”、“水到渠成”的境地。据一月底的初步统计，全国大部分城市和许多县的手工业全部实现了合作化，组织起来的人数已达全国个体手工业总人数50％以上。手工业社会主义改造的速度比原规划指标大大加快了。在合作化高潮的基础上，有些地区并掀起了生产高潮。如北京市许多新建的手工业合作社已开始劳动竞赛。河南省安阳市许多有专门技术的手工业劳动者，把多年不肯公开的技术传授给社员们。
    由于我国手工业人数众多，行业复杂，分布面广，社会经济性质不同，同工业、农业、商业等方面都有密切联系。因此，手工业的社会主义改造和技术改造工作，必须在“全面规划，加强领导”的方针下，充分运用已有的可能条件，继续克服保守落后思想，制定积极可靠的全面规划，采取有效措施，以便使这一改造工作按照又多、又快、又好、又省的要求向前发展。
    当前的中心工作是继续完成手工业合作化的组织任务，对于尚未组织起来的手工业劳动者，要深入地进行社会主义教育和社章教育，在自愿的原则下，或者按行业全部组织起来，或者分期、分批地进行组织，做到快而不乱。对于一时不易组织合作社的某些修理业、服务业及特殊的手工艺业，不要勉强去组织他们，让他们继续单干，但应在供销上帮助他们解决困难，技术上帮助他们提高。对于已经组织起来的合作社，凡不适宜于集中生产的行业，就应该保持分散生产的形式，就是适宜于集中生产的行业，也要作一番准备工作，然后有计划、有步骤地再集中生产。建社以后，原有的供销关系不能打断，而且应当扩大；原有的产品质量不能降低，而且应当提高；原有的产品品种不能减少，而且应当增加。对于原有的门市部、服务点不能轻易撤销，少数不合理的，要经过调查研究，逐步进行调整。对于分散零星的修理业、服务业，不仅不能减少，而且应当充分发挥他们串街游乡、生产上门的优点，更好地为居民服务。同时还必须加强对社员的政治思想教育，搞好团结，树立领导核心，妥善处理工具折价、股金缴纳等具体问题，逐步改变生产关系，建立必要与可行的管理制度，适时地进行巩固与提高工作，不断克服由小生产带来的资本主义经营思想和作风。
    手工业社会主义改造的目的，是为了解放生产力。由个体到组织起来，由分散生产到集中生产（指适宜于集中生产的行业），由手工业操作到逐步实现半机械化、机械化生产（指能够实行机械化的行业），有很大的潜力可以发挥。周恩来主席关于“把手工业的供产销计划尽可能地纳入国家的首先是地方的工业计划之内”的指示是非常正确的。只有在国家平衡和地方平衡的基础上，充分利用地方原料，适应地方需求，发展生产，提高技术，制造质量更好、品种更多、花色更新，价钱更加便宜的产品，才能更好地适应城乡人民生产上、生活上日益增长的需要，积极发挥手工业合作社对国营工业的助手作用。
    我国手工业的产品中有不少特种工艺品，如雕刻、刺绣、花边、织锦、地毯、景泰蓝、脱胎漆器等等，在国内外享有盛名。这是我国劳动人民智慧的结晶和民族的骄傲。对这些特种工艺，必须加以保存、发展和提高；对于生产特种工艺品的老艺人，必须加强团结和教育，并在生活上予以照顾，以充分发挥他们的智慧和特长，鼓励他们传授技艺，培养青年艺人，创造新的艺术品，但这还不够，还需要积极地、大量地培养高级工艺美术人材，以适应工艺美术的发展和提高的需要。
    手工业合作社是社会主义集体所有制经济，必须在提高劳动生产率的前提下，逐步提高社员物质、文化生活，改善劳动条件，举办劳动保险、文化学校、诊疗所、休养院、托儿所、阅览室、俱乐部、球队等文化福利设施，使手工业劳动者和全国人民一道，逐步摆脱贫困，走向富裕。
    手工业社会主义改造是一项伟大的变革。我们相信，在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，在国营工业和其他有关部门的帮助下，一定可以胜利的提前完成这一光荣任务。
