Chairman, esteemed committee members, comrades:

I fully agree with and support the reports by Premier Zhou and the vice-premiers, as well as Minister Chen Boda. These reports fill me with great excitement and encouragement.

Premier Zhou’s report repeatedly emphasized the need to further consolidate the alliance between workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and stated that intellectuals have become a part of the working class. In Premier Zhou’s report on the issue of intellectuals, he proposed that attention be paid to the work, life, and political treatment of intellectuals. This fully demonstrates the Party's concern and care for intellectuals. Given this series of glorious titles and treatments, and seeing workers, peasants, and industrialists and businesspeople reporting good news to Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, and other responsible comrades at this meeting, I truly feel ashamed in comparison. As a medical educator and medical scientist, what specific actions should I take to report good news? How should I respond to the Party and government’s care for us intellectuals? In this high tide of the socialist revolution, can we just waltz into a happy socialist society empty-handed? Certainly not, and it's even more inappropriate.

Chairman Mao pointed out: “…strive to change our country's backward state in economy, science, and culture, and quickly reach the advanced levels of the world.” Premier Zhou pointed out: “…strive to enable our country's most urgently needed scientific departments to approach the advanced levels of the world by the end of the third five-year plan.” This is the glorious task of our senior intellectuals. We must consider how to shoulder this glorious burden, complete and over fulfill this glorious task, and enter socialist society.

As a medical educator and medical scientist, in order to complete and over fulfill this glorious task, and bring some gifts into a completely modernized, highly cultured, prosperous, and strong socialist country, we must first do a good job in cultivating the next generation. However, "educators must first educate themselves." Premier Zhou also pointed out: "Helping intellectuals to carry out self-reform is of utmost significance for fully mobilizing and giving play to the strength of intellectuals." This is entirely correct and necessary. Let's use the teaching reform being carried out at the Northwest Medical College as an example to illustrate this point. For example, when using Soviet textbooks and teaching syllabuses, some teachers neglected the principle of student accessibility and neglected to improve teaching methods, thus causing students to feel overburdened, while the teachers still felt they were correct. Isn't this a typical idealistic teaching method? Others, starting from personal considerations, teach at a deeper level to show off their own abilities. Isn't this typical individualism? Some comrades, and myself even more seriously, become proud and complacent with ourselves when we achieve some success in our work, looking down on everything, and even forgetting the correct leadership of the Party. This not only hinders the progress of our work, but if it develops further, it can also lead to very serious mistakes. Moreover, the teacher's every word and deed should be a model for the students. If these ugly bourgeois ideas are not self-reformed in life, study, and work, how can we complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the Party and the people?

Improving the quality of teachers and cultivating teachers is the key issue in improving teaching quality and doing a good job in cultivating the next generation. The improvement of political and ideological level has already been discussed above. We must also pay attention to the improvement of professional level. By the end of the third five-year plan, we should cultivate teachers into red experts who are close to or catch up with the world level. This requires the widespread development of scientific research work in universities. In the Soviet Union, a person who does not do scientific research cannot be a university teacher. Moreover, the scientific research work of universities must be gradually raised to the world level. Furthermore, young lecturers and teaching assistants must be cultivated and raised to the world level, so that they can learn to work independently and then lead research work. Incidentally, I would like to mention that the education of students must also pay attention to improving their ability to work independently. At the same time, I fully agree with the method proposed by Vice-Chairman Guo that a mentor can lead 10 apprentices, which can be done in medical scientific research. I remember when I was studying in Japan, I saw many professors leading more than 10 researchers.

In order to complete this glorious task, I am determined to constantly improve my political and ideological level and professional level. Responding to Vice-Chairman Guo's call, I will reflect on myself every day with three questions. I will learn from advanced Communist Party members, demand myself according to the standards of Communist Party members, faithfully accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and advance victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong. I will dedicate all my knowledge and strength to cultivating and improving the next generation to become red experts with world-class levels, and to completing and over fulfilling the five-year plan.

    侯宗濂的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理和各位副主席及陈伯达部长的报告，这些报告给我很大的兴奋和鼓舞。
    周总理的报告中，屡次指出要更加巩固工农和知识分子的联盟，并且说知识分子已经成为工人阶级的一部分。在周总理关于知识分子问题的报告中，提出要照顾到知识分子的工作生活政治待遇等问题。这充分说明党如何地关怀和照顾知识分子。既然有了这一系列的光荣称号和待遇，在会上又看到工人农民和工商业者向毛主席、刘委员长、周总理以及各位负责同志报喜，对比一下，真是感到非常惭愧。作为一个医学教育工作者医学科学工作者的我，要用什么具体行动来报喜？来回答党和政府对我们知识分子这样的关怀？在这个社会主义革命高潮中，难道两肩担一嘴，赤手空拳，溜进幸福的社会主义社会么？肯定的不能，也更不应该。
    毛主席指出：“……努力改变我国在经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，迅速达到世界上的先进水平。”周总理指出“……争取在第三个五年计划期末使我国最急需的科学部门能够接近世界先进水平。”这就是我们高级知识分子的光荣任务。必须考虑如何担起这个光荣担子，完成和超额完成这个光荣任务，走进社会主义社会。
    作为一个医学教育工作者医学科学工作者，为了完成和超额完成这个光荣任务，而带些礼物进入一个完全现代化的、有高度文化的、富强的社会主义大国，首先就必须作好培养下一代的工作。可是“教育者必先教育自己”。周总理也指出：“帮助知识分子进行自我改造，对于充分动员和发挥知识分子力量，具有极其重大的意义。”这是完全正确而必要的。试用在西北医学院进行教学改革为例来说明一下这个问题。例如使用苏联教材，使用教学大纲的时候，有的老师忽视了学生的可接受性原则，忽视了改进教学方法，因而使学生感到负担过重，而教师还认为自己是正确的。这不是典型的唯心主义的教学方法么？还有的从个人出发，教的高深一些来显显自己本领，这不是典型的个人主义么？有些同志，我自己更严重，工作中稍微有些成就，自己就骄傲自满，目空一切，甚而忘记了党的正确领导，不只使工作进步受到了阻碍，发展下去，还会犯很严重的错误。而且老师的一言一行都应该是学生的榜样。这些丑恶的资产阶级思想若不在生活中学习中工作中加以自我改造，如何能完成党和人民交给的光荣任务呢？
    提高师资培养师资是提高教学质量作好培养下一代工作的关键问题。政治思想水平的提高以上已经说过了，还必须注意到业务水平的提高，应该在第三个五年计划的期末把教师们培养成接近世界水平或赶上世界水平的红色专家，这就必须在高等学校普遍地开展科学研究工作。在苏联不作科学研究的人不成其为高等学校教师。而且必须把高等学校的科学研究工作逐步地提高到世界水平。更必须把青年讲师助教培养和提高到世界水平，要使他们学会独立，进而可以领导研究工作。附带我想提一下，对学生的教育也必须注意提高他们的独立工作能力。同时我完全同意郭副主席所提出的，一个导师能带10个徒弟的办法，在医学科学研究上是可以作到的。我记得在日本留学的时候看到有许多教授是领导10个以上的研究人员的。
    为了完成这个光荣任务，我决心不断地提高自己的政治思想水平，业务水平。响应郭副主席的号召，每天要以三问来反省自己。向先进的共产党员学习，以共产党员的标准来要求自己，忠诚地接受共产党的领导，在毛泽东的旗帜下胜利前进。为培养和提高下一代成为具有世界水平的红色专家，为了完成和超额完成五年计划而贡献出自己的一切知识和力量。
