The Advanced Cooperative Takes Care of the Elderly, Weak, Widowed and Orphans
	Er Jin
	In the spring of 1955, when the Changqing Vegetable Production Cooperative (an advanced cooperative) in the suburbs of Hefei, Anhui Province, was established, eight elderly, weak, widowed, orphaned and disabled people had great concerns about joining the cooperative. For example, Yu Shaoqing, who was over 70 years old, could not work and had no children to support her, was facing great difficulties in both production and life. Seeing that others had joined the advanced cooperative, she also wanted to participate. However, when she heard that the cooperative distributed income entirely according to labor, she was so anxious that she cried.
	The cooperative's management committee held a special meeting to study this issue. They believed that they must help these people with difficult lives, and that the advanced cooperative had greater advantages and should be able to take care of their lives.
	They came up with many good ideas.
	They tried their best to make use of the strengths of the elderly, weak, widowed and orphaned, and assigned them appropriate light work. For example, the old woman Wang Kezhi was asked to take care of the children of women participating in the cooperative's labor, and she could earn two and a half work points every day. The blind man Zhang Xingbin was asked to make ropes and draw water, and he could earn 7 to 8 work points every day. The old man Hu Keshu and the disabled man Wang Ting'an, among others, were asked to watch the fields and warehouses, and they could also earn 2 to 5 work points every day. Wang Ting'an earned 700 work points from February to October 1955, earning more than 60 yuan in RMB; plus the income from November and December, it was enough for his food and expenses. Some people could not maintain their lives even with light work, so a portion of the cooperative's public welfare fund was allocated to take care of them.
	Those who were completely unable to work were also taken care of by the cooperative. For example, the old woman Yu Shaoqing, her land was given to the cooperative to cultivate, and the cooperative gave her a fixed amount of 450 catties of grain, 12 bundles of straw, and some pocket money every year, ensuring that she had enough to eat, burn, and use.
	At the beginning, some cooperative members also believed that absorbing the elderly, weak, widowed and orphaned would increase the burden on the cooperative, and they were not very willing. Now, they have realized that if the elderly, weak, widowed and orphaned are outside the cooperative, their production and lives will be difficult, and they will be exploited and go bankrupt, which is only beneficial to the development of capitalism. Some cooperative members said: "We cannot let them be poor when we are all rich."
	The elderly, weak and disabled people felt the warmth of the cooperative even more deeply. Wang Ting'an invested all his savings of dozens of yuan in the cooperative. He said: "I feel more at ease depositing money in the cooperative than keeping it with my own nephew." Yu Shaoqing smiled whenever she saw someone and said: "Walking the socialist road, an old woman like me who has no children to rely on now has a support!"

    高级社把老弱孤寡户都包下来了
    尔晋
    1955年春天，安徽省合肥市郊区长青蔬菜生产合作社（高级社）建社的时候，8家老弱孤寡残废的人，对入社有很大顾虑。如俞少清70多岁，不能劳动，无儿无女，生产、生活都很困难。眼看别人都加入高级社了，她也想参加。可是当她听说合作社是完全按劳分红的时候，急得直哭。
    社里的管理委员会专门开会研究了这个问题。他们认为：一定要帮助这些生活困难的人们，高级社有更大的优越性，应该而且可能把他们的生活包下来。
    他们想了许多好办法。
    他们尽量发挥老弱孤寡户的长处，分给他们适当的轻活。让老太婆王克芝给参加社里劳动的妇女带孩子，每天能得到两分半工分。让瞎子张兴宾搓绳、车水，每天能得到7分到8分工分。让老头胡克树和残废人王廷安等看场、看仓库，每天也可以得到2分到5分。王廷安1955年2月到10月，就得到700个工分，分得人民币60多元；再加上11、12两个月收入，足够他吃用。有些人做轻活仍然不能维持生活，就从社里的公益金中拨出一部分来照顾。
    完全不能劳动的也由社里包下来。例如老太婆俞少清，她的地交给社里种，社里每年固定给她450斤粮食，12担草，一些零用钱，保证她够吃够烧够用。
    开头，也有一些社员认为吸收老弱孤寡户会增加社内负担，不大愿意。现在，他们已经认识到：如果让老弱孤寡户在社外，他们的生产和生活没有办法，就会因此受人剥削而破产，这样只是对发展资本主义有利。有的社员说：“我们大家富裕了，决不能让他们受穷。”
    老弱残废的人们更深深感到合作社的温暖。王廷安把积存的几十块钱都投到社里。他说：“我把钱存到社里，比存在亲侄子手里要放心得多。”俞少清见人就笑嘻嘻地说：“走社会主义的路，我这无儿无女的老妈子也有了靠山啦！”
