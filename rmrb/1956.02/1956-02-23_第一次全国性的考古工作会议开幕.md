    The first national archaeological work conference in China's history opened in Beijing on the 21st. This conference was jointly convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Culture.

    Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out in his opening speech that the main tasks of this conference are to initially summarize the achievements of archaeological work in the six years since the founding of the country, exchange experiences to improve academic standards and work methods, and discuss the 12-year long-range plan for archaeological work.

    Guo Moruo said that Chinese archaeology, like other sciences, must approach the advanced scientific levels of the world within 12 years. To this end, it is necessary to greatly expand the ranks of archaeological workers and improve the ideological and professional level of archaeological workers. Guo Moruo pointed out that Chinese archaeological work has a long history since the Northern Song Dynasty, but it has not been well developed for a long time after the Northern Song Dynasty. Since liberation, a large number of ancient tombs and cultural sites have been excavated, and archaeological work has achieved unprecedented achievements, but there are only more than 500 archaeological workers, and their professional level is not high, so very little整理 research work has been done; to cope with the large number of archaeological work that has suddenly increased since liberation, it is necessary to make great efforts.

    Zheng Zhenduo, Vice Minister of Culture and Director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported on the achievements of archaeological work in the past six years and put forward the direction of future efforts. On the first day of the conference, reports were also heard from Jian Bozan, Director of the Department of History of Peking University, on the training of archaeological cadres, Yang Zhongjian, Director of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, on "Archaeological Work and Human Bones, Animal Bones and Other Remains," and Fei Xiaotong, Vice President of the Central Institute for Nationalities, on the relationship between archaeology and ethnology.

    More than 180 archaeologists and other archaeological workers in Beijing and from 21 provinces and cities participated in the conference.

    第一次全国性的考古工作会议开幕
    中国有史以来第一次全国性的考古工作会议21日起在北京举行。这个会议是由中国科学院和文化部联合召开的。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若在致开幕词的时候指出：这次会议的主要任务是初步总结建国六年来考古工作的成就，交流经验，以提高学术水平和改进工作方法，并且讨论考古工作的12年远景规划。
    郭沫若说，中国的考古学必须和其他科学一样，在12年内接近世界先进科学水平。为此，必须大大扩充考古工作人员的队伍，提高考古工作人员的思想水平和业务水平。郭沫若指出，中国的考古工作自北宋开始已经有长远的历史，但是北宋以后的很长时期内并没有得到很好的发展。解放以来，发掘了大量的古代墓葬和文化遗址，考古工作获得了空前的成就，但是考古工作者只有500多人，业务水平又不高，所以整理研究工作还做得极少；要应付解放以来突然增加的大量考古工作，还需要付出很大的努力。
    文化部副部长兼中国科学院考古研究所所长郑振铎在会上报告了六年来考古工作的成就，并且提出了今后的努力方向。会议的第一天还听了北京大学历史系主任翦伯赞关于培养考古干部问题的报告、中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室主任杨锺健的“考古工作和人骨兽骨等遗存问题”的报告，以及中央民族学院副院长费孝通关于考古学同民族学关系问题的报告。
    参加这次会议的有在北京的和来自21个省市的考古学家和其他考古工作人员180多人。
