　　The Fairy Tale Play "Malanhua" and its Performance
　　Jiang Dong
　　Playwright: Ren Deyao; Director: Lu Ya'nong; Performed by the China Children's Art Theater affiliated with the China Youth Art Theater.

　　At a time when writers and artists are actively creating children's literature, and when children's drama creation is not yet flourishing, the fairy tale play "Malanhua," adapted from a folk tale, brings us new gains and provides children with great pleasure and inspiration. The China Children's Art Theater, affiliated with the China Youth Art Theater, has received a warm welcome from young audiences for its creative, beautiful, and moving performance with a national style.

　　In many folk tales, stories like "Malanhua" tend to focus on love stories, but the author of the fairy tale play "Malanhua" does not take love as the main object of the drama's depiction. Instead, the author takes labor as the theme and main object of the drama’s depiction, which is very important for child audiences. Of course, this is not to say that there should be no love stories in children's dramas, but rather that the depiction of love should arouse in the depths of young audiences' minds a yearning for noble moral qualities and beautiful things. Overly highlighting the depiction of love should not be promoted. The author made a very meaningful choice and creation in using this type of legend to create children's drama.

　　In "Malanhua," the author creates positive characters loved by young audiences and negative characters they hate, highlighting the struggle between good and evil. These characters and this conflict attract all the young audiences, making them quickly fall in love with the hardworking and kind Malanhua, Xiaolan, and Wang Laodie, and envy Malanhua and his friends—the little monkey, the little horse, the morning glory, the foxtail grass…, and hate the insidious and cunning Old Cat, and despise the lazy Dalan.

　　The author created characters in the script that young audiences can understand. Malanhua selflessly jumps off a cliff to save Wang Laodie. He asks his friends to help the old man with his labor. He is so affectionate and considerate to the little animals and plants, and his love for Xiaolan is so pure and faithful. From the description of these specific behaviors, children receive a good education and fall in love with this diligent young man. As soon as the heroine Xiaolan and her sister Dalan appear in the script, the author vividly shows the two sisters' very different personalities. Starting with Dalan snatching the watering ladle from Xiaolan's hand and telling her to dig wild vegetables, the hardworking Xiaolan and the lazy Dalan form a contrasting portrayal throughout the play. As the Old Cat appears, the dramatic conflict unfolds layer by layer, and these two opposing images increasingly and clearly move towards their respective paths. The author also gives various personalities to the little animals and plants in nature: the playful little monkey, the clever little bird, the lively rabbit sisters, the kind deer mother and the innocent deer cub, the exquisite squirrel, the delicate morning glory and the honest foxtail grass, and the amiable pine tree grandpa. These characters are all so kind, hardworking, fair, and closely united. They are as close to Malanhua and Xiaolan as family. These little animals and plants that children are familiar with and love are personified by the author. This group of personified animals and plants is consistent with their characteristics and with children's living habits and rich imagination. It is very necessary for fairy tale creation to give life to natural creatures and let them live with humans. This can help children understand life, love life, broaden their horizons, develop their imagination, fill their spiritual world with many interesting things and beautiful images, and cultivate their excellent character. The character descriptions of the little animals and plants in "Malanhua" are vivid, especially the descriptions of their friendship with the male and female protagonists, which enrich Malanhua and Xiaolan's kind character. The fate of the male and female protagonists is linked to their fate. Whether it is Malanhua or the little bird, whether it is Xiaolan or the little monkey, they have become characters that children commonly love and care about. Therefore, when good overcomes evil, and Xiaolan and the little bird return to this strange and interesting world, the children cheer, smile, and applaud. And when the vicious Old Cat and the lazy Dalan escape towards the audience, the children tell the kind people on the stage in unison: "The Old Cat is here!" The children stand up and stare at them intently, chase after them, and even chase them backstage.

　　Like adult literary works, children's dramas also require the creation of distinct characters and the interesting unfolding of profound dramatic conflicts. Although some of the characters in the fairy tale play "Malanhua" are not clearly characterized, as the main images of the whole play, Malanhua and Xiaolan lack profound and moving depictions of their spiritual world and beautiful qualities. Apart from showing his brave behavior in saving Wang Laodie and fighting the vicious Old Cat, and showing his kindness in his love life with Xiaolan and his friendship with little animals and plants, Malanhua has very few actions in the whole play. Xiaolan's description is even more thin. At the beginning of the play, she is very hardworking in contrast to Dalan, but once she marries Malanhua and moves into the picturesque forest, she just plays with the little animals and plants and dresses up. What about labor? The little animals and plants do it for her. Because Xiaolan's character is not distinct enough, because the spiritual world of the male and female protagonists is not rich enough, and because the description of labor is not vivid enough, this pair of main images seems thin. In this way, the theme of labor and the theme of the struggle between good and evil cannot be more sharp and prominent. If the spiritual world of the male and female protagonists is expressed more fully, and the description of labor is more vivid, then the magical "Malanhua" will be even more attractive, because it is itself the crystallization of labor and the spirit of kind wisdom. The struggle between good and evil surrounding this flower would be much sharper than it is now. Now, it seems that the little animals and plants each have their own distinct characters, but the characters of Malanhua, Xiaolan, and Wang Laodie are not as distinct as theirs, which is a major shortcoming.

　　The two negative characters in "Malanhua": Dalan and Old Cat, also have some shortcomings in characterization. Dalan is a lazy girl who covets pleasure. She is seduced by the Old Cat—an evil demon—and pushes her younger sister Xiaolan into the river. As a girl growing up in a woodcutter's family, she develops from a lazy character into a murderer. The script's description of this development is jumpy, and the line of character development is not clear enough, which weakens the authenticity of this character image to a certain extent. The description of the Old Cat is better. His purpose of trying to seize the magical Malanhua is clear and specific; the Old Cat's ugly and fierce character is also relatively clear. However, if his spiritual world can be described more deeply, as a representative of evil forces, he can achieve a greater educational effect.

　　The performance of the China Children's Art Theater affiliated with the China Youth Art Theater is very beautiful and moving. The performers created a stage design with national characteristics and a wonderfully interesting mythical atmosphere for the young audiences, such as the light signaling of flowers, plants, and trees, the little birds flying in the air, and the sudden growth of apple trees… The use of some national etiquette in the wedding scene of Malanhua and Xiaolan is also very appropriate, and a festive atmosphere envelops the entire stage. Some places also use events that are common in children's lives very naturally, such as the little animals looking in the mirror at Malanhua's home. These interesting stage creations are closely combined with the theme, character, and conflict of the drama, rather than simply creating national characteristics and a fairy tale atmosphere. These careful creations that are adapted to children's living habits and psychological characteristics make the play more acceptable to young audiences, and they feel more intimate and interesting about the events that occur on the stage. The music throughout the performance is also very harmonious, and the appearance of the theme musical phrases makes it easier for young audiences to understand everything as the plot develops. The actors' performances, music playing, the appearance of wonderful things on the stage, and beautiful dances form a whole, and the entire performance is full of fairy tale poetry.

    童话剧“马兰花”和它的演出
    江东
    作剧：任德耀　导演：鲁亚农　中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团演出
    在作家、艺术家积极创作儿童文学作品的时际，在儿童戏剧创作还不够繁荣的今天，根据民间传说改写的童话剧“马兰花”，给我们带来了新的收获，给孩子们带来了极大的愉快和启示。中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团富有创造性的、优美动人的民族风格的演出，受到小观众的热烈的欢迎。
    许多民间传说中，马兰花这样的故事是比较偏重爱情描写的，但是童话剧“马兰花”的作者，却没有把爱情作为戏剧描写的主要对象，而是把劳动作为戏剧的主题和主要描写对象的，对儿童观众来说这是很重要的。当然，这不是说儿童戏剧中不应该有爱情描写，而是说：爱情的描写应该在小观众的心灵深处引起他对崇高道德品质和美好事物的向往，过份地突出爱情描写是不应该提倡的。“马兰花”的作者运用这类传说创作儿童戏剧，作了很有意义的选择和创造。
    作者在“马兰花”中，创造了为小观众所喜爱的正面人物和他们所憎恶的反面人物，突出地揭示了善良同邪恶的斗争。这些人物和这场冲突，吸引着所有的小观众，使他们很快地就爱上了劳动善良的马兰花、小兰和王老爹，羡慕着马兰花和他的朋友——小猴、小马、喇叭花、狗尾巴草……，而去憎恨阴险狡猾的老猫，唾弃懒惰的大兰。
    作者在剧本中创造了为小观众能够理解的人物。马兰花奋不顾身地跳下悬崖去拯救王老爹，他要朋友们帮助老人劳动，他对小动物和小植物是那样亲昵体贴，他对小兰的爱情是那样纯真忠实。就从这些具体行为的描写中，孩子们受到了好的教育，爱上了这个勤恳的年轻人。剧本中的女主人公小兰和她的姐姐大兰刚一出现，作者就鲜明地表现了姐妹两人迥然不同的性格，从大兰抢过小兰手里浇花的瓢叫她去挖野菜，开始，勤劳的小兰和懒惰的大兰就在全剧中形成了一个对比的写照。随着老猫的出现，戏剧冲突一层层展开，这两个对立形象越来越明显地走向各自的道路。自然界的小动物和小植物，作者也赋予了他们各种不同的性格：顽皮的小猴，机灵的小鸟，活泼的兔姐兔妹，慈祥的鹿妈妈和天真的鹿娃子，玲珑的松鼠，娇羞的喇叭花和憨直的狗尾巴草，和蔼的松树公公。这些人物，都是那样善良、勤劳、公正，那样亲密的团结，他们和马兰花、小兰亲如家人。这些孩子们熟悉的、喜爱的小动物和小植物，在作者笔下人格化了。这群人格化的动物、植物，是和它们的特性一致的，也是和孩子们生活的习惯、丰富的想像一致的。把自然界的生物赋予生命，让他们和人类生活在一起，这对童话创作来说是十分必要的，这样可以帮助孩子们认识生活，热爱生活，扩大他们的眼界，发展他们的想像力，使他们的精神世界充满许多有趣的事物和美好的形象，培养他们优美性格。“马兰花”里的小动物和小植物的性格描写是生动的，特别是对他们和男女主人公的友谊的描写，又丰富了马兰花和小兰的善良性格；男女主人公的命运和他们的命运是联结在一起的，不论是马兰花还是小鸟，不论是小兰还是小猴，都成为孩子们共同喜爱、共同关怀的人物。所以，当善良战胜了邪恶，小兰、小鸟重新回到这个奇异有趣的人间来的时际，孩子们欢叫起来了，笑开来了，鼓起掌来。而当恶毒的老猫和懒惰的大兰向观众席逃走的时候，孩子们异口同声地告诉舞台上善良的人们：“老猫在这儿！”孩子们站起来眈眈地注视着他们，追上去，抓住他们，甚至追到后台。
    和成人的文艺作品一样，儿童戏剧中也要求塑造出性格鲜明的人物，有趣地展开深刻的戏剧冲突。童话剧“马兰花”里虽有些人物性格的刻划还不鲜明。作为全剧的主要形象马兰花和小兰，他们的精神世界和优美的品德缺少深刻动人的描绘。马兰花除了在救王老爹和跟狠毒的老猫斗争等场面中显示了他的勇敢行为，在他和小兰的爱情生活以及和小动物、小植物的友谊相处中显示了他的善良之外，他在全剧中的动作就很少了。小兰的描写更是单薄了一些。戏刚开始的时候，她和大兰对比之下是很勤恳的，但她一和马兰花结了婚，搬进了风光如画的树林里之后，她只不过和小动物小植物玩玩，梳梳妆罢了，劳动呢？小动物小植物都替她作了。由于小兰的性格不够鲜明，由于男女主人公的精神世界不够丰满，以及对劳动的描写不够生动，这一对主要形象就显得单薄了。这样，劳动的主题、善与恶的斗争的主题，也就不能更尖锐更突出。如果男女主人公的精神世界表现得更丰满，对劳动的描写更生动，那么那枝神奇的“马兰花”就更能吸引人了，因为它本身是劳动的结晶、善良的智慧的精灵；环绕这枝花所展开的善与恶的斗争，就会比现在尖锐的多了。现在看来，小动物小植物是各自有他们的鲜明性格的，但马兰花、小兰、王老爹这些“人”的性格就不如他们那样鲜明了，这是一个主要缺点。
    “马兰花”中的两个反面人物：大兰和老猫，在性格刻划上也存在一些缺点。大兰是一个懒惰的、贪图享乐的女孩子，她被老猫——邪恶的魔鬼引诱而把自己的亲妹妹小兰推下河去。作为一个生长在砍樵人家的少女，她从一个性格懒惰发展成杀人者。剧本对她这种发展的描写是跳跃的，性格的发展线索是不够鲜明的，因而就在一定程度上减弱了这个人物形象的真实性。而对老猫的描写就比较好，他图谋夺取神奇的马兰花的目的，是鲜明具体的；老猫的丑恶的、凶狠的性格，也比较清楚；但是，如果能对他的精神世界描写得更深刻些，那么，作为一个邪恶势力的代表，他就可以收到更大的教育效果了。
    中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团的演出是很优美动人的，演出者为小观众们创造了具有民族色彩的舞台设计和奇妙有趣的神话气氛，例如花草树木和马兰花轻盈地示意，小鸟凌空飞来，苹果树突然长出……。在马兰花和小兰结婚一场运用一些民族礼节也很恰当，喜庆的气氛笼罩着整个舞台；有些地方运用儿童生活中常有的事件也很自然，例如在马兰花家里小动物们照镜子等等。这些有趣的舞台创造，都是和戏剧的主题、人物性格、冲突紧紧相结合的，而不是单纯为制造民族色彩、童话气氛。这些和儿童生活习惯、心理特征相适应的精心创造使这个戏更为小观众们所能接受，对舞台上所发生的事件更感到亲切有趣。整个演出的音乐也是很谐和的，主题乐句的出现使小观众们更容易地随着剧情发展而理解了一切。演员表演、音乐演奏、舞台上奇妙事物的出现、优美的舞蹈，构成了一个整体，整个演出充满了童话的诗意。（附图片）
