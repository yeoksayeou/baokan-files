Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's report on intellectuals, and the other four important reports. These reports summarize the great achievements our country has made in international activities and the struggle to defend peace, as well as in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. At the same time, they point out the glorious tasks of our people in continuing the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, continuing to deepen the socialist revolution, and intensifying the construction of the motherland. These reports are inspiring, giving people a profound ideological strength and encouraging them to study harder, work creatively, and fight tenaciously for the socialist cause.

Chairman Zhou Enlai pointed out in his political report with righteous indignation: "In any case, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and Taiwan will eventually return to the motherland." At the same time, he appealed to the Taiwan compatriots and all Kuomintang military and government personnel who fled from the mainland to Taiwan, urging them to stand under the banner of patriotism and work with the people of the motherland to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the realization of the complete unification of the motherland. This is a great encouragement to the Taiwan compatriots who have a revolutionary tradition. It is also another convincing proof of the Chinese Communist Party's consistent advocacy of national unity, unanimous opposition to foreign aggression, and opposition to imperialism. Regarding this proposition of the Chinese Communist Party, I myself have a personal and profound feeling and experience. On this solemn platform, I would like to offer a sincere piece of advice to the Kuomintang military and government personnel who have fled to Taiwan, hoping that they will recognize the general trend, understand that continuing to act as tools of American imperialism will inevitably lead to a very bad outcome, and thus arouse their patriotic conscience, stand on the side of the Chinese people, and strive to perform meritorious service in the action of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, so that Taiwan compatriots can return to the embrace of the motherland and they themselves can be forgiven by the people of the motherland.

Our meeting this time is convened under a new situation. A clear sign of this new situation is that the cause of world peace and human progress has made great achievements. Our country's agricultural cooperation movement has achieved a great victory. In the rural areas across the country, 500 million farmers have launched a socialist revolutionary upsurge, surging forward towards the socialist road of common prosperity and happiness. Semi-socialist agricultural cooperation can be realized nationwide this year, and complete socialist agricultural cooperation can be realized in another two years. The Chinese Communist Party has also put forward a draft of the "National Agricultural Development Program Outline from 1956 to 1967." This draft outlines the bright prospects for agricultural production and rural work in our country, and points out active and reliable goals for 500 million farmers to strive for. The upsurge of socialist transformation of our country's handicrafts has already begun, and the transformation of handicrafts can be basically completed by next year. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country has also entered a new stage. At the beginning of this year, large and medium-sized cities across the country have launched an upsurge of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. The third annual plan of our country's first five-year plan has been successfully completed. With effort, we are fully confident of completing the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. Our country's contingent of intellectuals is expanding day by day, their political consciousness has been significantly improved, and they are investing themselves in the country's construction work with full enthusiasm. This series of great victories has brought about a fundamental change in the political situation in our country. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Our country is currently in a great upsurge of socialist revolution," and "In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed throughout the country."

The upsurge of socialist revolution and the comprehensive upsurge of socialist construction in our country have put forward new tasks for our country's intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals. To carry out socialist construction at a flying speed and on a huge scale, in additional to relying on the active labor of the working class and the broad masses of farmers, it is also necessary to rely on the active labor of intellectuals, rely on the rapid improvement of science and technology, and rely on the close combination of manual labor and mental labor. Chairman Mao Zedong called on the people of the whole country, first of all the intellectuals, to march towards science and strive to catch up with the world's advanced level of science. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a meeting on the issue of intellectuals, and decided to strengthen leadership with great efforts and carry out overall planning, with the greatest determination to solve the problems of intellectuals in terms of quantity, professional level, and political awareness, so as to give full play to and grow the strength of intellectuals. We believe that the intellectual circles across the country will be a hundred times more excited and sincerely grateful for the concern and support of the Chinese Communist Party, and will quickly improve their political awareness and professional level, strengthen unity, expand the ranks, and engage in faithful and tireless labor for the country's economic construction, national defense construction, and cultural construction, and contribute their intelligence and talent without reservation.

The upsurge of socialist revolution and the comprehensive upsurge of socialist construction in our country have also put forward new tasks for the old Kuomintang and the middle and upper-level military and government personnel who have historical relations with the old Kuomintang, including the middle and upper-level figures in the military and political circles of the late Qing Dynasty and the Northern Warlord government era. It should be said that over the past six years, the above-mentioned people have made progress to varying degrees in various social reform movements and in the practice of national economic recovery and construction, and have contributed a certain amount of strength to varying degrees. However, it should also be admitted that our own ideological level and the strength we have contributed are still far from the requirements of the situation. We now all feel that the situation is developing fast and we cannot keep up, and we need to study hard. In 1949, we had such a feeling; now, we have a similar feeling again. I think such a feeling is not surprising. Lenin said: "After every profound political revolution, the people need a long time to understand this revolution." Chairman Mao also said: "Events are developing so fast that many people feel sudden and feel the need to relearn." However, it is not enough to just feel that one's ideological understanding and working ability are lagging behind the development of the situation and objective requirements. One must deeply recognize the seriousness of the lag, catch up, and pursue urgently. It is necessary to constantly urge oneself to study hard, transform one's thinking, and improve one's awareness of patriotism and internationalism, and serve the cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. To transform one's selfish and arrogant individualism brought from the old society, to abandon the decadent bourgeois viewpoints and styles, and to carry out a thorough self-transformation, one must, on a conscious basis, through observation and practice of social life, tempering in actual work, and constant and painstaking theoretical study, constantly self-exhort and self-encourage, conduct self-criticism, and at the same time, with the help of external forces, humbly accept criticism. We firmly believe that the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, will be closely united, actively work hard, and will definitely be able to complete the political tasks assigned in the people's democratic united front, and will definitely be able to carry out the work of self-transformation and self-education among the middle and upper-level figures in the old military and political circles, leading them to devote themselves to the socialist cause, and enter socialist society together with the people of the whole country.

    程潜的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告、郭沫若副主席关于知识分子问题的报告和其它四个重要报告。这些报告总结了我们国家在国际活动和保卫和平的斗争中、在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业中所取得的伟大成就，同时也指出了我国人民在继续反对国内外敌人的斗争、继续深入社会主义革命和加紧建设祖国的光荣任务。这些报告是振奋人心的，它给人们一种深厚的思想力量，鼓舞着人们加倍努力地学习，创造性地进行工作，为社会主义事业顽强奋斗。
    周恩来主席在政治报告中义正词严地指出：“无论如何，中国人民一定要解放台湾，台湾最后亦必然归还祖国。”同时又向台湾同胞和一切从大陆跑到台湾的国民党军政人员发出号召，要他们站到爱国主义旗帜下来，同祖国人民一起，争取和平解放台湾，实现祖国的完全统一。这是对具有革命传统的台湾同胞的莫大鼓励。这也是中国共产党一贯主张全民族团结、一致对外、反对帝国主义的令人信服的又一次明证。对于中国共产党的这个主张，我自己有着亲切的、深刻的感受和体验，在这个庄严的讲台上，我愿意向跑到台湾的国民党军政人员进一忠言，希望他们认清大势，明白继续充当美帝国主义的工具必定要得到很坏的结局，因而激发起爱国天良，站到中国人的立场上来，争取在和平解放台湾的行动中立功，使台湾同胞回到祖国的怀抱，使自己获得祖国人民的宽恕。
    我们这次会议是在新形势之下召开的。作为这个新形势的鲜明标志是：世界和平和人类进步事业获得了很大成就；我国农业合作化运动取得了伟大胜利，在全国农村中，五万万农民掀起了一个社会主义革命的高潮，汹涌澎湃地向着共同富裕和繁荣幸福的社会主义道路前进，在全国范围内，今年就可以实现半社会主义的农业合作化，再以两年的时间，就可以实现完全社会主义的农业合作化，中国共产党还提出了“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”草案，这个草案描绘了我国农业生产和农村工作的光辉远景，给五万万农民指出了积极可靠的奋斗目标；我国手工业的社会主义改造的高潮已经开始到来，到明年就可以基本上完成手工业的改造工作；我国资本主义工商业的社会主义改造也进入了一个新的阶段，今年年初，全国大中城市就都掀起了资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的高潮；我国第一个五年计划的第三个年度计划已经胜利完成，经过努力，我们就完全有把握提早和超额完成第一个五年计划；我国的知识分子队伍正在日益扩大，他们的政治觉悟有了显著的提高，并正在以满腔热情投入祖国的建设工作当中。这一系列的伟大胜利，使我们国家的政治形势发生了根本的变化，正如毛泽东主席所说：“目前我国正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中”，“大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成”。
    我国社会主义革命高潮和社会主义建设事业全面高涨的形势，给我国的知识分子特别是高级知识分子提出了新的任务。我们要以飞跃的速度和巨大的规模来进行社会主义建设，除了必需依靠工人阶级和广大农民的积极劳动以外，还必需依靠知识分子的积极劳动，依靠科学技术的迅速提高，依靠体力劳动和脑力劳动的密切结合。毛泽东主席号召全国人民，首先是知识分子向科学进军，为迅速赶上世界科学先进水平而奋斗。中共中央最近召开了一次关于知识分子问题的会议，决定要用大力来加强领导，全面规划，以最大的决心来解决知识分子在数量方面、业务水平方面、政治觉悟方面的问题，使知识分子的力量得到充分的发挥和成长。我们相信，全国知识界一定会百倍兴奋，由衷地感激中国共产党的关切和支持，迅速地提高自己的政治觉悟和业务水平，加强团结，扩大队伍，为国家的经济建设、国防建设和文化建设事业而从事忠实的、不倦的劳动，毫不吝惜地、毫无保留地贡献出自己的聪明才智。
    全国社会主义革命高潮和社会主义建设事业全面高涨的形势，给旧国民党及与旧国民党有历史关系的中上层军政人员，包括清末、北洋政府时代的军政界中上层人士，同样提出了新的任务。应该说，六年多来，上面提到的这些人士经过各项社会改革运动以及在国民经济恢复和建设工作的实践中，都有不同程度的进步，并在不同程度上贡献出一定的力量。但是，也应该承认，我们自己的思想水平和贡献出来的力量，和形势对我们的要求还相差很远。我们现在都感到，形势发展得快，自己赶不上去，需要好好学习。1949年，我们曾经有过这样的感觉；现在，我们又有类似的感觉。我想，这样的感觉是不足为怪的。列宁说过：“在每一次深刻的政治革命之后，人民都需要很长的时间去理解这种革命。”毛主席也说过：“事变是发展得这样快，以致使很多人感到突然，感到要重新学习。”但是，对自己的思想认识和工作能力落后于形势的发展和客观的要求这个问题，仅仅感觉到了是不够的，必须深切地认识到落后的严重性，迎头赶上，急起直追。必须不断地鞭策自己努力学习，改造思想，提高爱国主义与国际主义的觉悟，在中国共产党领导下，为社会主义建设事业服务。要改造自己从旧社会带来的自私自利、自高自大的个人主义思想，要摒弃腐朽的资产阶级观点和作风，进行脱胎换骨的自我改造，就要在自觉的基础上，通过对社会生活的观察和实践、实际工作的锻炼和不断刻苦的理论学习，时时刻刻自策自励，进行自我批评，同时借助于外力，虚心地接受批评。我们坚信，中国国民党革命委员会，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，紧密团结，积极努力，一定能够完成在人民民主统一战线分工中的政治任务，一定能够在旧军政界的中上层人士中进行自我改造和自我教育的工作，带动他们投身于社会主义事业，和全国人民一道进入社会主义社会。
