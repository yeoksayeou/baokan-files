　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union met on February 17th to continue discussing the reports of the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission of the CPSU.

　　The representatives who spoke during the morning session included: ? Smirnov and Surkov from Moscow, V. Suslov from Krasnodar Krai, S. Chikus from Lithuania, Titov from Ivanovo, Struyev from Molotov Oblast, Denisov from Saratov, and Organov from Krasnoyarsk Krai, among others.

They unanimously supported the report of the Central Committee of the CPSU and expressed their determination to strive for the further high tide of the national economy.

　　Maurice Thorez, head of the delegation of the French Communist Party, and Palmiro Togliatti, head of the delegation of the Italian Communist Party, delivered congratulatory messages at the morning session.

　　Thorez said that the working people of the world and all progressive mankind warmly welcome the draft directives of the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan. They see that the Soviet people, under the leadership of their Communist Party, are moving towards a better future, towards a society of prosperity and happiness for all. The brilliant example of the Soviet Union proves that the planned and steady development of national productivity, as well as the fundamental improvement of the conditions of the working people and the satisfaction of their material and cultural needs—all this depends on transferring power into the hands of the working class.

　　Speaking of the Soviet Union’s active struggle for peace, Thorez said that the French people's gratitude and sympathy for the Soviet Union have never been so profound. Thanks to the increasing strength of the socialist camp and the countries fighting for peace, the French people have never been so firmly convinced that avoiding war is possible as they are today.

　　Thorez emphasized that the French Communists are making persistent efforts in their struggle for peace and the bright future of their country to establish the united action of the working class and the united action of the Socialists and the Communists. It is precisely in the struggle for the united action of the working class that the French Communist Party has increased its influence among the masses, thus achieving a great victory in the parliamentary elections on January 2nd. The French Communist Party will always care for the happiness of its people, and they will fight to ensure that the French people have a future worthy of their revolutionary tradition.

　　Togliatti said that in Italy, as in other parts of the world, not only Communists but also millions of non-Communist workers are watching this congress. Your achievements fill their hearts with hope and confidence. They know that your decisions are new and huge contributions from your great party to the final victory of the cause of the liberation of the working people and to the victory of democracy and peace.

　　Togliatti said that we are always striving to be loyal to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and to maintain close ties with all strata of the working people. It is precisely because of this that the Italian Communist Party has been able to become a powerful party deeply rooted among the workers, peasants, and the Italian people.

　　Togliatti pointed out that the Italian working class has already made great gains in building its unity. This is first reflected in the fraternal cooperation between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. He said that at this congress, we are more confident in the invincibility of the cause of socialism. We will bring this confidence to all ordinary people who hope to live in a better world. We will lead them to fight for this better world.

　　The speeches of Thorez and Togliatti were warmly welcomed by the participants.

　　Academician ? Smirnov spoke about the problems currently facing Soviet science. He said that a vivid achievement of Soviet science is its progress in the research of nuclear energy and the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. The main task of the Soviet Academy of Sciences is to discover and study new phenomena in nature and society. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to vigorously develop theoretical research, mainly in the physical, mathematical, chemical, and biological departments of science. They must illuminate the future path into new technologies and production.

　　Surkov spoke specifically about the development of Soviet literature. He said that our literature and art must be perfect not only in content but also in artistic power and skill. Soviet writers must write more about the people and must have the ability to deeply observe the lives of the people. With the help of the Central Committee of the Party, we will make our works worthy of the builders of communism.

　　Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, also delivered a congratulatory message at the morning session. He said that the conclusions in the report of the Central Committee of the CPSU regarding the possibility of avoiding war in the current era, the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, and the forms of transition to socialism in different countries are of extremely great significance for the struggle to defend peace and strive for social progress. The people of the socialist countries see in the great victories achieved by the Soviet Union in its domestic and foreign policies the decisive factors for strengthening the economic potential of the entire socialist camp and further developing the fraternal cooperation between the countries of this camp. The Romanian Workers' Party believes that the friendship between the Romanian people and the Soviet people, and between the Romanian people and the people of all socialist camp countries, is an invaluable wealth of the people.

　　When Gheorghiu-Dej finished speaking, the participants applauded him warmly.

　　G. M. Malenkov spoke at the afternoon session.

　　Razakov from Kyrgyzstan and Ignatov from Gorky Oblast also spoke at the afternoon session.

　　The delegates warmly welcomed Vulko Chervenkov, head of the delegation of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and Mátyás Rákosi, head of the delegation of the Hungarian Working People's Party, who delivered congratulatory messages to the congress.

　　Chervenkov said that the Bulgarian people, together with the working people of the world, are pleased with the epoch-making achievements made by the Soviet Union in its foreign and domestic policies in recent years. We Bulgarian Communists, inspired by the Leninist spirit embodied in this congress, and inspired by the estimates and conclusions made by this congress after analyzing the Soviet Union's international environment and internal conditions, will do everything possible to continuously improve our work, creatively apply the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and abide by the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, so as to better lead socialist construction.

　　Rákosi said: The progressive mankind of the world is watching the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This congress brilliantly demonstrates the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as the vibrant ideas of proletarian internationalism and the fraternal friendship of all ethnic groups. This congress will give new strength to the working people of the world and will enrich with great experience the people who are building a new life and fighting for freedom.

    多列士说，全世界劳动人民和全体进步人类热烈地欢迎苏联第六个五年计划的指示草案，他们看到，苏联人民在他们的共产党的领导下，正在向一个更美好的将来，向一个大家繁荣幸福的社会迈进。苏联的光辉范例证明了，国家生产力的有计划的和稳步的发展，以及劳动人民的状况的根本改善、他们的物质和文化需要的满足——这一切决定于把政权转移到工人阶级的手中。
    多列士在谈到苏联为争取和平而进行的积极斗争时说，法国人民对苏联的感激和同情从来没有这样深厚，由于社会主义阵营和为和平而斗争的国家日益强大，法国人民从来没有像今天这样坚定地相信避免战争是可能的。
    多列士强调说，法国共产党人在他们争取和平和他们国家的光明的未来的斗争中，正在进行坚持不懈的努力，以求建立工人阶级的统一行动和社会党人同共产党人的统一行动。法国共产党正是在争取工人阶级的统一行动的斗争中才增加了它在群众中的影响，从而在1月2日的议会选举中取得了巨大的胜利。法国共产党将永远关心他们的人民的幸福，他们将为保证法国人民有一个同他们的革命传统相称的未来而斗争。

    陶里亚蒂说，我们始终是在努力忠于马克思列宁主义的教导，同劳动人民中的各个阶层保持密切的联系。正是因为这样，意大利共产党才能够成为一个在工人、农民和意大利人民中间深深扎下根的强大的党。
    陶里亚蒂指出，意大利工人阶级已经在建立它的团结方面有了很大的收获。这首先反映在共产党和社会党之间兄弟般的合作方面。他说，在这次代表大会上，我们对社会主义的事业的不可战胜，更有信心了。我们将把这种信心带给一切希望在一个美好的世界中生活的普通人民。我们将领导他们为争取这个美好的世界而斗争。
    多列士和陶里亚蒂的讲话受到了与会者的热烈欢迎。
    ?斯米扬诺夫院士在发言中谈到了目前苏维埃科学所面临的问题。他说，苏维埃科学的一个生动的成就，是它在研究核子能与和平利用核子能方面的进展。苏联科学院的主要工作是发现和研究自然和社会的新现象。在第六个五年计划期间，必须开始大力发展理论研究，主要是在科学的物理数学、化学和生物学部门。它们必须照亮进入新技术和生产的未来的道路。
    苏尔科夫在发言中专门谈到了发展苏联文学的问题。他说，我们的文学和艺术必须不但在内容方面是完善的，而且在艺术力量和技巧方面也是完善的。苏联作家必须写出更多关于人民的作品，并且必须具有深入观察人民生活的能力。在党中央的帮助下，我们将使我们的作品无愧于共产主义的建设者。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治也在上午会议上致了贺词。他说，苏共中央的报告中关于现时代避免战争的可能性、具有不同社会制度的国家的和平共处，以及不同国家过渡到社会主义的形式等问题的结论，对于保卫和平和争取社会进步的斗争是有极其巨大的意义的。各社会主义国家的人民在苏联对内和对外政策方面取得的伟大胜利中，看到了加强整个社会主义阵营的经济潜力和进一步发展这个阵营各国间的兄弟合作的决定性因素。罗马尼亚工人党认为，罗马尼亚人民同苏联人民之间、罗马尼亚人民同所有社会主义阵营国家人民间的友谊，是人民的无可估量的财富。
    乔治乌—德治讲话结束时与会者热烈向他鼓掌。

    契尔文科夫说，保加利亚人民同全世界劳动人民一道对于苏联近年来在外交和国内政策方面所取得的划时代的成就感到高兴。我们保加利亚共产党人，在这次代表大会所体现的列宁主义精神的鼓舞下，在这次代表大会在分析了苏联的国际环境和内部状况以后所作出的估计和结论的鼓舞下，将尽一切力量不断改进我们的工作，创造性地应用苏联共产党的经验，遵守马克思列宁主义的教导，从而更好地领导社会主义建设。
    拉科西说：全世界进步人类都在注视苏联共产党第二十次代表大会。这次代表大会光辉地表明了苏联共产党的牢不可破的团结，同时也表明了无产阶级国际主义的生气蓬勃的思想，以及各族人民的兄弟般的友谊。这次大会将给全世界劳动人民以新的力量，并且将以伟大的经验来丰富正在建设新生活的人民和为自由而斗争的人。
