    The meeting passed a resolution on the specific work of the Vietnam Fatherland Front in 1956, and also passed a message of respect to President Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as a letter to the people of South Vietnam.

He pointed out that the struggle for the peace, unification, independence, democracy, and prosperity of Vietnam is a long-term and arduous one. The current task of the Vietnam Fatherland Front is to mobilize the people to realize the program of the Fatherland Front, and to do everything possible to consolidate North Vietnam in all aspects, complete land reform, and fulfill the "1956 National Plan." Truong Chinh said that the Vietnamese people resolutely demand the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords, unify the country peacefully on the basis of independence and democracy, and resolutely oppose the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem's unilateral "elections" and war preparation schemes.

In his report, Hoang Quoc Viet put forward three work tasks for the Vietnam Fatherland Front in 1956: First, to mobilize the people to vigorously consolidate North Vietnam in all aspects, and to persist in and develop the patriotic movement of the people of South Vietnam. Second, to promote the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords and mobilize the people to strengthen political struggle, in order to urge the Southern regime and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to conduct consultations and unify the country through general elections. Third, to consolidate and expand the national united front, and strive for the sympathy and support of peace-loving people around the world for the Vietnamese people's struggle to unify their motherland.
