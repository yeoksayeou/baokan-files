Prince Sihanouk's Speech at Beijing Airport

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I am greatly honored and fortunate to have the opportunity to visit your great country, China, the capital of this friendly nation, at the gracious invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai. As the head of the Cambodian national delegation, I would like to take this opportunity to express brotherly affection to China.

Indeed, this is the first time that Cambodians have come to your country for a formal visit. However, as early as the Angkor Dynasty, there were contacts between the Chinese and Cambodian people, which means that the ancient relationship between our two peoples dates back approximately 1,000 years. But for the last 100 years, Cambodia was a protectorate of another powerful nation, and so it remained silent and unknown.

After the Second World War, I was fortunate enough to unite and strengthen the vital forces of the Cambodian people. Our united strength enabled us Cambodians to win complete independence for our motherland in 1953, just as our nation enjoyed in ancient times.

Because we have achieved complete independence, today we have the superior conditions to come and rebuild friendly relations with Cambodia's oldest friend, China.

As a representative of the Cambodian people (who voted in favor of the party I preside over), and as the head of the Cambodian government, I am most gratified to be in contact with the Chinese government headed by His Excellency Zhou Enlai. During the Bandung Conference, I already had the opportunity to admire the wisdom, acumen, and perfect integrity of this statesman.

Although China and Cambodia have different political systems, the policies and ideas of the Chinese government and state are the same as those of the Cambodian government and state. The goal of our domestic policy is prosperity and raising the living standards of the people. Our foreign policy is characterized by neutrality, contributing to peace and friendship with all countries, respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence of other countries, non-aggression, and non-interference in the affairs and forms of government of other countries.

Precisely because China and Cambodia share the same ideas and adopt the same policies, our two peoples and governments now maintain a completely trustworthy and very close friendly relationship.

I firmly hope that the friendship that exists between our two peoples, as well as our peaceful coexistence and mutual respect for sovereignty, will provide an example and a way for the world to live in friendship, freedom, and peace.

### 西哈努克首相在北京机场的讲话

    西哈努克首相在北京机场的讲话阁下，各位女士，各位先生：
    我应周恩来总理的盛情邀请，有机会来访问你们伟大的国家——中国，访问这个友好的国家的首都，感到极大的光荣，同时也十分幸运。作为柬埔寨国家代表团团长，我愿借此向中国表示兄弟般的亲切的情谊。
    诚然，柬埔寨人来到你们国家作正式访问还是第一次。可是，远在安可王朝时代，中国人民和柬埔寨人民之间就有了联系，这就是说，我们两国人民之间的古老的关系已经有了大约1，000年的历史。但最近100年来，由于柬埔寨沦为另一个强国的保护国，它才默默无闻了。
    第二次世界大战以后，我幸而能够团结了柬埔寨人民的有生力量，并且加强了这种力量。我们团结的力量使我们柬埔寨人在1953年给祖国获得了如像我们民族在古代所享有的完全独立。
    由于我们取得了完全的独立，今天我们才有这优越的条件前来同柬埔寨最老的朋友——中国重建友好关系。
    我作为柬埔寨人民的代表（柬埔寨人民投票拥护我主持的政党），作为柬埔寨政府首脑，前来同以周恩来阁下为首的中国政府接触，我感到最大的满意。在万隆会议期间，我已经有机会景仰这位政治家的智慧、精明和完美的正直。
    尽管中国和柬埔寨的政治制度是不同的，但是中国政府和国家同柬埔寨政府和国家的政策和思想是同样的。我们的对内政策的目标是：繁荣和提高人民的生活水平。我们的外交政策的特点是：中立、对和平和各国的友好作出贡献，尊重别国的主权、领土完整和独立，互不侵犯，互不干涉别国的事务和别国政府的形式。
    正因为中国和柬埔寨具有同样的思想，采取同样的政策，所以，现在我们两国人民和两国政府之间保持着完全可以信赖的、十分密切的友好关系。
    我确定地希望：我们两国人民之间存在的友谊，以及我们的和平相处、互相尊重主权，将对于使世界能在友好、自由、和平中生存提供一个榜样和办法。
