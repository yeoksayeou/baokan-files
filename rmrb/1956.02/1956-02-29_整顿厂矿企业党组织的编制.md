Streamlining the Organization of Party Committees in Factories and Mines
Xu Fa

In light of the development of production in enterprises and the continuous increase in the number of employees and Party members, it is necessary to appropriately expand the institutions and staffing of Party organizations in factories and mines. However, many Party organizations want to rely solely on full-time Party workers to carry out their work. Coupled with serious bureaucratism and preoccupation with administrative matters from top to bottom, this has made these Party organizations bloated and top-heavy. In the First Engineering Division of the First Engineering Bureau of the Northeast Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, full-time Party workers who are detached from production account for 1.1% of the total number of employees in the division and 14.7% of the number of Party members. Among them, the staff of the general branch committee accounts for about one-third of all full-time Party workers. Full-time staff of the Party Committee of the Northeast First Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry account for slightly less than 10% of the number of Party members. The staff of the Party Committee accounts for 41% of all full-time staff. Although the proportion of Party members to the total number of employees in the capital construction sector is smaller than that in factories and mines, on average, there is one full-time Party worker for every ten or even fewer Party members, which is too many in any case. Moreover, most of these workers are concentrated in the Party Committee and the General Branch Committee; the staff of the workshop and section branches are few and weak. The organization and staffing of Party organizations in factories and mines also have the same unreasonable situation. In a large factory in Shenyang, the Party organization has more than 140 full-time staff, accounting for 1.1% of the total number of employees, and about 40% of them are concentrated in the Party Committee. Many Party Committees have established organization departments, propaganda departments, and general offices, and some even have groups or sections under the departments. The Party organization is already so large, and yet many people are still clamoring that there are too few people and that they cannot take care of their work, and they hope to increase the number of people. It seems that only when the Party organization has a large number of full-time staff can the Party's work be strengthened.

Is it true that more people and a large organization can do things well? The fact is not so. The Party organization of the Muling Coal Mine in Heilongjiang used to have only 9 full-time staff, and the work of the Party organization was done well. Now, the number of full-time staff of the Party organization has increased to 23, but the work is not as good as before. The Party Committee of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory originally had only 13 full-time staff, and the Party Committee Secretary could often go deep into the workshops; now, the number of full-time staff has increased to more than 30, but the responsible persons of the Party Committee cannot go deep into the workshops. This shows that relying on more people does not necessarily make things work. In 1953, the staffing of the Party organizations in many large factories and mines in Shenyang, except for the 53 Factory, exceeded the regulations of the former Northeast Bureau. However, the work of the Party organization of the 53 Factory was the best among these units. It can be seen that simply relying on expanding staffing and increasing personnel cannot do the Party's work well. On the contrary, the bloated organization of the Party organization has a very bad impact on the work of the Party organization.

One of the major evils of the Party organization relying solely on a small number of full-time staff to carry out its work is that a few people monopolize the Party's work, without giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all Party members, and without educating, organizing, and mobilizing the masses through all Party members. There is a huge potential force for improving and strengthening the Party's work in all Party members, but because the Party organization has become large, the Party's leaders can only see the full-time staff of the Party Committee and not the strength of more Party members and activists. Tightening the staffing of the Party organization can prompt the Party's leaders to see the strength of Party members and activists and resolve to change the tendency of a few people to monopolize the Party's work.

When there are many people in the Party Committee, the leaders can rely on the staff to go to the workshops to understand the situation. They can spend a lot of time sitting in the room to hold meetings, engage in various plans and summaries, and also have the workshop branch staff accompany them to hold meetings and spend a lot of time writing materials. This is a major problem for the workshop Party organization staff. In this way, they cannot have enough time to carry out various activities among the masses. At the same time, because there are many levels of the Party organization and the organization is large, it is difficult to reflect the situation below in a timely manner, and sometimes it is even stranded in the middle. When the staff of the branch, especially the Party members and the masses, have something to talk to the Party Committee Secretary about and hope to get some specific help from the Party Committee Secretary, they are often "blocked" by the staff of the Party Committee Office, so that the Party Committee Secretary is divorced from the masses.

The fact is very clear that in general organizations, more people do not necessarily do things well; in Party organizations in factories and mines, too many full-time cadres are more harmful, which not only cannot strengthen the Party's work, but also hinders the close connection between the Party organization and the masses. Therefore, Party organizations in factories and mines should quickly, resolutely, and vigorously compress the existing staffing to meet the needs of the current situation.

    整顿厂矿企业党组织的编制
    许法
    根据企业生产的发展、职工人数和党员数目不断增多的情况，厂矿党组织的机构和编制适当地扩大是必要的。但是，有许多党组织却想单纯依靠专职的党的工作人员进行工作，加上从上到下的官僚主义和事务主义作风很严重，就使这些党组织机构臃肿、头重脚轻。建筑工程部东北工程管理总局第一工程公司第一工程处党组织，脱离生产的专职党工作人员占这个处职工总数的1.1％，占党员人数的14.7％，其中总支委员会的工作人员又占全部专职党工作人员的三分之一左右。重工业部建筑局东北第一工程公司党组织的专职工作人员占党员人数的10％弱。党委会的工作人员又占全部专职工作人员的41％。虽然，基本建设部门中党员占职工总数的比例比厂矿要小，但是，平均十个甚至不到十个党员就有一个专职的党的工作人员，无论如何也是太多了。而且，这些工作人员又大部集中在党委会和总支委员会；车间和科室支部的工作人员既少又弱。厂矿党组织的机构和编制存在着同样的不合理情况。沈阳市有一个较大的工厂，这个厂的党组织的专职工作人员竟有140多人，占职工总数的1.1％，而且，其中有40％左右集中在党委会中。许多党委会下面都设有组织部、宣传部、办公室，有的甚至部下面还有组或科。党组织的机构已经这样庞大，而有不少人还在吵嚷着人手太少，工作照顾不过来，希望再增加人员。好像只有党组织拥有大批的专职工作人员，党的工作才能加强。
    真是人多机构大就好办事吗？事实并不是这样。黑龙江穆稜煤矿党组织过去只有9个专职人员，党组织的工作作得较好；现在，党组织的专职工作人员增加到23人，工作反而不如以前。哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂党委会原来只有专职工作人员13人，党委书记还能经常深入车间；现在，专职人员增加到30多人，党委会的负责人员反而深入不下去。这说明了靠人多并不一定能够把事情办好。1953年，沈阳市除五三工厂外，许多较大厂矿的党组织的编制都超过了前东北局的规定。但是，五三工厂党组织的工作在这些单位中却是最好的。由此可见，单纯依靠扩大编制增加人员是作不好党的工作的。相反的，党组织的机构臃肿，却给党组织的工作带来很不好的影响。
    党组织单纯依靠少数专职工作人员进行工作有一个很大的恶果，就是使少数人包办了党的工作，而不去充分发挥全体党员的积极性创造性，不去通过全体党员去教育群众组织群众。在全体党员中蕴藏着改进和加强党的工作的巨大的潜在力量，但是因为党组织的机构庞大以后，党的领导人员的眼睛就只能看到党委会的专职工作人员，而看不到更多的党员和积极分子的力量。紧缩党组织的编制，就可以促使党组织的领导人员看到党员和积极分子的力量，而决心改变少数人包办党的工作的偏向。
    党委会的人多，领导人员就可以依靠办事人员下车间了解情况，自己可以用很多的时间坐在屋子里开会、搞各种计划总结，并且还得车间支部的工作人员也来陪着开会，也来花很多时间写材料。这是车间党组织工作人员的一大苦恼。这样他们不能有充分的时间在群众中进行各种活动。同时由于党组织的层次多，机关大，下边的情况很难及时反映上来，有时甚至中间搁浅。支部的工作人员特别是党员和群众有事想找党委书记谈谈，希望得到党委书记的一些具体帮助，常常被党委会办公室的工作人员“挡驾”，使党委书记脱离群众。
    事实是很清楚的，在一般的机关里，人多不一定能把事办好；在厂矿党组织中，专职干部过多，危害性就更大，不仅不能加强党的工作，反而阻碍了党组织和群众的紧密联系。因此，厂矿党组织应该迅速地坚决地大力压缩现有的编制，以适应目前形势的需要。
