Comrades Chairman and Committee Members:

    We support Premier Zhou's "Political Report" and Vice Chairman Li's "Work Report," and agree with all other thematic reports.

    Now, please allow me to express some opinions on the adoption and promotion of new technologies in the steel industry. This opinion was put forward after consultation and discussion by eight of us who are engaged in scientific and technological work in the steel industry, and they appointed me to speak at the conference.

    Fellow committee members: We are now in the high tide of China's agricultural cooperative movement, and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and the handicraft cooperative movement have also reached a high tide throughout the country. This new upsurge in socialist transformation not only creates extremely favorable conditions for industrial development, but also inevitably requires industry to adapt and accelerate, because only in this way can it meet their technological transformation and production needs. In particular, the steel industry is the foundation of all industrial development. This glorious and arduous task requires not only rapid development of the steel industry, but also a high level of technology. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "Catch up with the world's advanced scientific, cultural and technological levels in a not too long period of time." In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, our working class has demonstrated great enthusiasm and creativity, enabling China's blast furnace and open hearth furnace utilization coefficients to reach the level of the Soviet Union in 1952. However, in general, our steel industry is still far behind the world level, and the speed of development is far from compatible with the domestic socialist transformation. In order to accelerate and catch up, the adoption and promotion of new technologies in the steel industry has become one of the important measures.

    Now we will only talk about the oxygen converter steelmaking method, which has been effective in the world in recent years. It is fully in line with Chairman Mao's call for "more, faster, better, and more economical." The construction investment of an oxygen converter steelmaking plant is about 50% compared with the same scale open hearth steelmaking plant, and the production cost per ton of steel is about 80% of that of open hearth steel. Obviously, this shows that it is "faster" and "more economical." So what about "more"? The general calculation of the output of oxygen converter steelmaking is that the annual output of a 35-ton converter is roughly equivalent to the annual output of two 225-ton open hearth furnaces. Since the use of cheap oxygen blowing in converter steelmaking, the quality of steel has been greatly improved, at least the same as that of open hearth furnaces, and it has also reached the requirement of "better." Not only that, it can also solve the problem of insufficient scrap steel supply in China for a considerable period in the future; converter oxygen steelmaking does not require fuel, and can save gas for urban and power use; converter steelmaking is not as strict on raw materials as open hearth furnaces, etc. All of these are in line with China's actual situation in the process of industrialization.

    So, what about the reality of China adopting oxygen converter steelmaking? First of all, it is proved from scientific theory and the practice of various countries in the world that this method is developing rapidly and the scope of application is expanding. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, in 1956, a new type of converter steelmaking plant with an annual output of 2.5 million tons was put into production. In recent years, there have also been quite a few small converter steelmaking plants in Northwest, Southwest, North China, and East China, and their output accounted for about one-quarter of the country's total steel output in 1955. Some experience has been accumulated and some technicians and technical cadres have been trained. It should be pointed out here that China has made new progress in the small alkaline side-blown converter steelmaking method. In addition, the technical assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries has created favorable conditions for our large-scale construction and production in the future. Academician Balkin, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Comrade Samarin, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, suggested during their visits to China that converter steelmaking should be the direction of China's steelmaking development. The suggestions of these world scientific authorities are well-founded and are based on China's actual conditions.

    Therefore, we suggest that the large-scale production of oxygen converter steelmaking be considered in the steel industry plan in order to accelerate the speed of China's industrialization; at the same time, scientific research institutions should strengthen research and experiments in converter steelmaking to cooperate with the development of converter steelmaking.

    However, our suggestion does not mean that the adoption of converter steelmaking is the only way out for steelmaking in the future. Other steelmaking methods such as electric furnaces and open hearth furnaces still have important significance for their development in meeting the needs of high-quality steel supply.

    In order not to fail the concern and expectation of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for intellectuals, we engineering and technical workers will never "sleep by the roadside" as the socialist revolution reaches its climax. We will strive to transform our thinking, learn from the Soviet Union to improve our professional ability, strengthen unity to train new forces, and strive to complete the five-year steel industry production plan in four years and strive to catch up with the international advanced technical level in a short period of time.

    Finally, in order to rapidly develop China's steel industry, we hope that relevant scientific and technological experts such as geology, coal, mechanical and electrical manufacturing scientific research, etc., will give us strong and timely cooperation and collaboration to jointly complete Chairman Mao's glorious task of "more, faster, better, and more economical"!

    杨树棠的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我们拥护周总理所作的“政治报告”和李副主席的“工作报告”，并同意其他各项专题报告。
    现在请允许我就钢铁工业中采用和推广新技术的问题发表些意见。这个意见是经过我们8位从事钢铁工业科学技术工作的同志协商讨论后提出来的，他们指定我在大会上发言。
    各位委员：我们现在正处在我国农业合作化运动的高潮中，资本主义工商业的改造、手工业合作化运动又在全国范围内达到了高潮的历史时期。这个社会主义改造事业的新高潮，不仅给工业发展创造了极其有利的条件，而且也必然要求工业相适应，要求工业加快速度，因为只有这样才能够满足它们的技术改造和生产需要。特别是，钢铁工业是一切工业发展的基础。这个光荣而又艰巨的任务，不但要求钢铁工业发展速度快，而且要求它技术水平高。正如周总理报告中所指出：“在不太长的时间内赶上世界的先进的科学文化技术水平。”我国钢铁工业，几年来，在党和政府的正确领导下，在苏联和各人民民主国家的无私帮助下，我们工人阶级发挥了伟大的积极性和创造性，使我国的高炉及平炉的有效利用系数达到了苏联1952年的水平。但是，总的来讲，我们钢铁工业仍然大大地落后于世界水平，而发展的速度又与国内社会主义改造事业远远地不相适应。为了加快速度迎头赶上，在钢铁工业中采用和推广新技术，就成了重要措施之一。
    现在我们只就转炉氧气炼钢这个在世界上近几年来行之有效的炼钢方法来谈一下。它是完全符合毛主席“又多、又快、又好、又省”的号召的。转炉氧气炼钢厂的建设投资与同样规模的平炉炼钢厂相比约当50％，而每吨钢的生产成本相当于平炉钢的约80％。很显然，这说明它是“又快”、“又省”。那末“多”呢？转炉氧气炼钢的产量一般的计算：一座35吨转炉的年产量大约相当于二座225吨平炉的年产量。转炉钢自从利用了价值便宜的氧气吹炼后，钢的质量大大提高，起码与平炉相同，也达到了“好”的要求。不但如此，它还可以解决我国在今后相当期间内废钢供应不足的问题；转炉氧气炼钢不用燃料，可以节省出煤气供应城市和动力之用；转炉炼钢对原料的限制不像平炉那样严格等。所有这些都与我国在工业化过程中实际情况相符合的。
    那末，我国采用转炉氧气炼钢的现实性又怎样呢？首先从科学理论和世界各国实践当中证明，这个方法正在迅速地向前发展，采用范围日益扩大，拿苏联来说，1956年就有年产250万吨的新型的转炉炼钢厂投入生产。几年来，我国西北、西南、华北、华东等地的小型转炉炼钢为数也不少，它们的产量在1955年约占全国钢的总产量四分之一。已经积累了些经验，培养了些技术工人和技术干部。这里应该指出：我国对小型碱性侧吹的转炉炼钢方法更有了新的发展。再加上苏联和各人民民主国家的技术援助等等，这都给我们今后大规模的建设和生产创造了有利的条件。苏联科学院副院长巴尔金和苏联科学院通讯院士萨马林同志来我国访问时，曾先后建议：转炉炼钢应该作为我国炼钢发展的方向。这些世界上科学权威人士的建议，是有充分根据的，是从我国实际条件出发的。
    因此，我们建议：在钢铁工业规划中考虑采用转炉氧气炼钢大规模地生产，以加快我国工业化的速度；同时在科学研究机关加强转炉炼钢方面的研究试验工作，以配合转炉炼钢的发展。
    但是，我们这个建议，不是说今后炼钢方向采用转炉炼钢是唯一的出路，其他炼钢方法如电炉、平炉在供应高质量钢的需要方面仍然有它们的发展的重要意义。
    我们工程技术工作者，为了不辜负党中央和毛主席对于知识分子的关怀和期待，我们将随着社会主义革命高潮，决不在“路旁睡觉”。努力思想改造，学习苏联提高业务能力，加强团结培养新生力量，努力做到五年钢铁工业生产计划四年完成和争取短期内赶上国际先进技术水平。
    最后，为了我国钢铁工业迅速地发展，希望有关的科学技术专家们如地质、煤炭、机电制造科学研究等等，给我们大力地及时地配合协作，为共同完成毛主席指示我们“又多、又快、又好、又省”的光荣任务而奋斗！
