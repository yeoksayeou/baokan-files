    By the 10th, the workers of over one hundred state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines in Beijing had proposed to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Among them, more than 20 enterprises have successively proposed to brother enterprises across the country to launch a socialist emulation campaign to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    The workers' enthusiasm for labor is very high. Since January 1, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has overfulfilled its pig iron production plan every day. Young machinists in machine manufacturing factories such as Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant have generally launched a competition to become "youth machinist shock workers." Zhi Guangqian, a worker in the foundry workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, and Shen Qunwang, a worker in the processing workshop, have completed this year's workload. Zhi Guangqian is already working on the second quarter of 1957.
    The leadership departments of many factories and mines are actively leading the socialist emulation campaign of the masses of workers. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has already made a plan to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. The engineering and technical personnel of this factory also held a representative meeting in late January to discuss and formulate measures and plans for scientific research, promotion of advanced experience, and other measures to ensure the completion of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In order to help workers achieve the conditions for the competition, the technical personnel of the Beijing Paper Mill worked in three shifts like the workers. The Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant held an exchange meeting on 10 advanced experiences on February 3, and organized competitions for planners, dispatchers, statisticians, inspectors, and other personnel.

    北京一百多个厂矿积极争取提前完成五年计划
    到10日止，北京已经有一百多个国营、地方国营厂矿企业的职工提出要提前完成第一个五年计划。其中有20多个企业先后向全国兄弟企业倡议开展提前完成五年计划的社会主义竞赛。
    职工们的劳动热情十分高涨。石景山钢铁厂从1月1日以来，每天都超额完成生产生铁的计划。北京第一机床厂等机器制造工厂的青年机工，普遍开展了争取作一个“青年机工突击手”的竞赛。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂翻砂车间工人支广谦和加工车间工人沈群旺，已经完成了今年的工作量，其中支广谦已经在做1957年第二季度的工作了。
    很多厂矿企业的领导部门都积极领导职工群众的社会主义竞赛。石景山钢铁厂已经作出四年完成五年计划的规划。这个厂的工程技术人员也在1月下旬举行了代表会议，讨论和制定了保证提前完成五年计划的科学研究、推广先进经验等措施计划。北京造纸厂的技术人员为了帮助工人实现竞赛条件，和工人一样分成3班工作。北京第一机床厂在2月3日举行了10种先进经验的交流会，并且组织了计划员、调度员、统计员、检查员等人员的竞赛。
