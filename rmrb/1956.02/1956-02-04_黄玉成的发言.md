Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

In Premier Zhou's political report, the issue of intellectuals was mentioned, and yesterday, Dean Guo also gave a detailed supplementary report on this issue. The reason why intellectuals have become an issue today is because we are in the midst of a great socialist revolution, and our current intellectual strength, whether in terms of quantity, professional skills, or political awareness, is still insufficient to meet the needs of the rapidly developing socialist cause. As an engineering technician, I deeply feel the seriousness of this problem in the process of textile industrial construction. In order to adapt to this urgent need, the issue of intellectuals must be quickly and correctly resolved. Regarding effective methods to solve this problem, Premier Zhou pointed out how to most fully mobilize and utilize the existing strength of intellectuals, how to continue to help intellectuals carry out self-reform, and how to expand the ranks of intellectuals and improve their professional level. The Central Committee will also take a series of measures to accomplish this task. In my opinion, the Central Committee's guiding principles and policies on the issue of intellectuals are completely correct. The remaining question now is how we intellectuals ourselves should understand and treat this issue.

Undoubtedly, among our intellectuals, after several years of education by the Party, the majority have already stood on the side of socialism. However, due to the long-term influence of the old society, there are inevitably varying degrees of bourgeois viewpoints and styles. Therefore, leaning towards the Party is still not enough, and some intellectuals even have a certain disconnect with the Party, and serving the people is not entirely wholehearted. This not only hinders their own progress but also reduces the role that intellectuals should play in the cause of socialist construction. This is definitely wrong and must be thoroughly corrected. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, we all realized how earnest the Central Committee's expectations and demands of intellectuals are. Whether in terms of unity and education, or in terms of living and political treatment, everything is carefully considered for the sake of intellectuals, and the utmost is done. This cannot help but deeply move us. In order to live up to the expectations of the Central Committee and to accelerate the great cause of socialist construction, we should quickly, actively, and thoroughly carry out self-reform. Relying on the leadership and help of the Party, through the observation and practice of social life, the practice of our professions, and the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, these three interconnected paths, we must ensure that we transform from unmindful or half-hearted intellectuals to intellectuals who serve socialism wholeheartedly.

In the process of self-reform, we must ideologically anticipate two possible mistakes and thoroughly correct them. The first is the "I am the best in the world" mentality, being arrogant and self-important, and oblivious to others. Therefore, we will not rely on the masses, refuse to accept new things, and refuse to absorb new advanced experiences. If this mistake is not corrected, it will surely become an obstacle to self-reform. The other is a feeling of discouragement. We are excessively humble and underestimate the role we can play in the cause of socialist construction, believing that it is not easy to catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels in a country with relatively backward science. Therefore, we lack confidence, are not active, and lack energy. This erroneous thinking will also affect the speed of our self-reform. In fact, with the wisdom of our great Chinese nation and the cultivation of the Party, it is possible for us to stride forward and reach the world's advanced scientific levels. In the past, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party of China, we have won countless glorious and unprecedented great victories on the military, political, and economic fronts. In the future, on the scientific and cultural front, with the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, there is no doubt that we will achieve another great victory and catch up with the world's most advanced scientific and cultural levels. This is also a great and glorious combat mission for us intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals. Comrades, let us, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, thoroughly carry out self-reform and strive for the great cause of socialist construction!

    黄玉成的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    在周总理的政治报告中，曾经提到了知识分子问题，昨天郭院长对这个问题也作了详细的补充报告。知识分子今天之所以成为问题，这是因为我们处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中，我们知识分子现有力量，无论在数量方面、业务方面、政治觉悟方面，都还不能适应社会主义事业急速发展的需要。我是一个工程技术人员，在纺织工业基本建设工作过程中，也深深感到这一个问题的严重性，为了适应这个迫切的需要，知识分子问题就必需迅速地正确地加以解决。关于解决这个问题的有效方法，周总理指出了如何最充分地动员和发挥知识分子现有的力量，如何继续帮助知识分子进行自我改造，如何扩大知识分子的队伍和提高其业务水平，中央并将采取一系列的措施来完成这个任务。据我看来，中央对知识分子问题的方针政策是完全正确的，现在剩下的问题是我们知识分子本身应如何来认识这个问题，如何来对待这个问题。
    毫无疑问地，在我们知识分子中，通过党的数年教育以后，大多数都已经站到社会主义方面了。可是由于过去受到旧社会长久的熏陶，不可避免地还存在着不同程度的资产阶级观点和作风。因此向党靠拢还嫌不够，部分知识分子与党之间甚至还存在着某种隔膜，为人民服务不尽是全心全意。这样不仅阻碍了自己的进步，而且也减低了知识分子在社会主义建设事业中应有的作用，这个肯定是错误的，也是必需彻底加以纠正的。我们听了周总理报告之后，大家体会到中央对知识分子的期待和要求，是如何的恳切，无论在团结教育方面，在生活政治待遇方面，处处都是为知识分子考虑周详，仁至义尽，这就不能不使我们深深地有所感动。为了不辜负中央的期望，为了加速伟大的社会主义建设事业，我们就应该赶快地、积极地、彻头彻尾地进行自我改造。我们依靠党的领导和帮助，通过社会生活的观察和实践，业务的实践和马列主义理论的学习，这样三个互相联系的途径，我们一定要保证，由无心无意或是半心半意转变为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子。
    在自我改造过程中，我们思想上估计到可能有两种错误，必须彻底改正。头一种是老子天下第一，自高自大，旁若无人。因此我们不会依靠群众，不肯接收新的事物，不肯吸收新的先进经验。这种错误若不加纠正，就一定会成为自我改造的障碍；另一种是自馁情绪，我们过分谦虚，低估了自己在社会主义建设事业中所能起到的作用，认为在一个科学比较落后的国家里，要赶上世界先进科学的水平是不容易的。因此就没有信心，就不积极，就没有劲头。这种错误思想也会影响到我们自我改造的速度。其实，我们有了伟大的中华民族的智慧，有了党的培养，就有可能大踏步地向前迈进，走上世界先进科学的水平。我们过去在中国共产党毛主席英明领导之下，在军事、政治、经济各个战线上无数次地获得了辉煌的，史无前例的伟大胜利，今后在科学文化战线上，我们有了党中央毛主席的英明领导，毫无疑问地我们定将获得再一次的伟大的胜利，迎头赶上世界最先进的科学文化水平，这也就是我们知识分子，特别是高级知识分子的一个伟大的光荣的战斗任务。同志们，让我们在党中央毛主席英明领导下，彻底进行自我改造，为伟大的社会主义建设事业而奋斗吧！
