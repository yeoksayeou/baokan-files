In the CPPCC meeting, after listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of the vice-chairmen, as well as the speeches of everyone, I express my complete support and agreement with extremely excited feelings.

In recent months, our cities and villages have appeared particularly prosperous and beautiful. Everywhere we see the double happiness symbol and hear the sounds of gongs, drums, and firecrackers. People in the cities and villages are enthusiastically celebrating the beginning of entering socialist society. Recently, the CPC Central Committee put forward the National Agricultural Development Program, and Chairman Mao called on the people of the whole country to march toward science. The further prosperity and strength of our country is already visible to the eye.

This CPPCC meeting is a general mobilization meeting to accelerate the building of our socialist society. I fully support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. I fully support the 40-article program for agricultural development put forward by the CPC Central Committee. I am willing to make my greatest efforts to realize it.

In the 40 articles of the agricultural development plan, the most glorious and great tasks are pointed out for health work. The Ministry of Health is holding a national health work conference, and is discussing and studying specific measures to achieve these tasks. I can guarantee here to our Chairman Mao and to everyone: we will make every effort to complete this great and glorious task, so that the workers, peasants, and all laborers' descendants will live healthier and happier lives generation after generation.

I should not hide the shortcomings and mistakes in our work even more. Due to the main responsible comrades of the Ministry of Health and myself neglecting the Party's leadership in health science, and deviating from Chairman Mao's guiding instructions on uniting Chinese and Western medicine and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, serious losses have been brought about in health work. Today I can tell everyone: under the leadership of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, we have already had a change, and in the future we must actively catch up. In five years, seven years, and at most no more than 12 years, we will completely improve the national health outlook. By that time, schistosomiasis, filariasis, hookworm disease, kala-azar, encephalitis, plague, malaria, smallpox, and venereal diseases will be basically eliminated. Rats, flies, mosquitoes, as well as lice, fleas, and bedbugs will no longer be harmful. Comrades, these are things our ancestors dared not imagine. Today, we have already arranged and planned them.

Some of the diseases mentioned above may not have been heard of by some members. For example, schistosomiasis is prevalent in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and areas south of the Yangtze River in our country. Rice-producing areas are precisely the areas where this disease is severely prevalent. The peasants there have to go into the water to plant rice; women use river water to wash clothes and vegetables; children play by the lakes and ponds, and graze water buffaloes; these are labors that cannot be avoided. It is precisely in carrying out these labors that they are infected by a kind of cercaria growing in the water that enters human skin, and from then on they get sick, developing fever, diarrhea, and slowly their bellies become enlarged, and they can no longer work. If children get this disease, their development will be severely damaged; if women get this disease, they cannot give birth; and many young and middle-aged people get this disease. Currently, more than 10 million peasants in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces are suffering from it, and at the same time 100 million people are threatened by schistosomiasis. If this disease is not eliminated, then it is very incompatible with our socialist country. The other diseases are also the most harmful diseases to people's health. In short, the purpose of health work is to relieve the people's suffering from diseases, protect and improve the people's health, so as to promote the development of productive forces. The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government are very concerned about the health of the people, and have recently instructed the health departments to basically eliminate these diseases within a time limit, which proves this fully.

When the bourgeoisie was in power in old China, how could they have thought of these things? Peasants had no land, and how could they fight against diseases in a life of poverty?

What is the guarantee for basically eliminating these diseases today? The most fundamental guarantee is that the superior socialist system provides favorable conditions for the high development of science, and advanced science can be used to overcome these diseases. At present, the vast rural areas are beginning to enter socialist society, and the peasants are urgently demanding the elimination of these diseases. They have extremely high enthusiasm to participate in this movement. Therefore, we can smoothly carry out this work under the leadership of the Party. The Party gives us instructions and organizes our forces. Under the education of the Party, the vast number of Chinese and Western doctors have greatly improved. Medical scientists are actively carrying out scientific research work. We already have preventive measures and therapeutic drugs. We prevent and treat at the same time. The people and medical personnel work together, and after a period of time, we can basically eliminate them. Now, after research, some areas have stipulated that they can be eliminated in six years, some in five years, and some can be eliminated in two years.

Here, I would like to make a request to everyone: please help health work more, and publicize health knowledge to the people more, so that the ignorance, superstition, and unhygienic conditions left over from the old society can be quickly changed, and our country can be built into a country with a high degree of culture, civilization, and hygiene!

    李德全的发言
    我在政协会议上听了周恩来主席的政治报告和各位副主席的报告并各位的发言后，我以极兴奋的心情，表示完全拥护和同意。
    近几个月来，我们的城市和乡村显得特别兴旺，特别美丽，到处见到的是双喜字，听到的是锣鼓鞭炮声。城市的人，乡村的人都在热烈庆祝着开始进入社会主义社会。最近中共中央又提出了全国农业发展纲要，毛主席号召全国人民向科学大进军。我们国家的进一步繁荣富强，已经是眼睛可以看见的了。
    这次的政协会议就是加紧建设我国的社会主义社会的总动员大会。我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告。我完全拥护中共中央提出的发展农业40条纲要。我愿意为实现它尽我最大的努力。
    关于发展农业的规划40条里，给卫生工作指出了最光荣的伟大任务。卫生部正在召开着全国卫生工作会议，正在讨论研究实现这些任务的具体措施。我可以在这里向我们的毛主席，向大家提出保证：我们要以全力完成这个伟大光荣的任务，使工人们、农民们及一切劳动者们的子子孙孙一代比一代生活的更健康，更幸福。
    我更不应当隐讳我们工作中的缺点和错误。由于卫生部的主要负责同志和我自己忽视了党在卫生科学方面的领导，脱离了毛主席对团结中西医、发扬祖国医学遗产方针性的指示，以致在卫生工作中带来了严重的损失。今天我可以告慰大家：在党、毛主席和国务院的领导下，我们已经有了转变，今后更要积极地迎头赶上去。在五年、七年、最远不超过12年，我们要彻底改进全国的卫生面貌。到那时候，血吸虫病、血丝虫病、钩虫病、黑热病、脑炎病、鼠疫病、疟疾、天花和性病等基本上就消灭了。老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子还有虱子、跳蚤、臭虫也再不能为害了。各位同志，这些都是我们先人所不敢想像的，在今天我们已经安排计划了。
    上面说的几种病，也许是有些委员们不曾听过的。像血吸虫病，流行在我国的长江中下游和长江以南地区。出产水稻地区，正是这种病流行严重的地区。那里的农民要下水种田；妇女们用河水洗衣服，洗菜；小孩子在湖沼边打湖草，放水牛；这是不能不做的劳动。恰恰就在进行这些劳动中，被水里生长着的一种尾幼虫钻进人的皮肤，从此就得了病，发热，拉痢，慢慢地肚子大起来，人就不能劳动了。小孩子得了这个病，发育就会受到严重破坏；妇女得了这个病，就不能生育；青壮年得了这个病的是很多。目前在江、浙、两湖、皖、赣等省有1，000多万农民受其害，同时有一亿人口受着血吸虫病的威胁。这个病不消灭，那就与我们社会主义的国家很不相称了。其他的几种病也是危害人民健康最厉害的病。总而言之，卫生工作的目的，就是要解除人民的疾病痛苦，保障和增进人民的健康，从而才可以促进生产力的发展。中国共产党和人民政府是十分关心人民的健康的，最近曾指示卫生部门限期把这些疾病基本消灭，更可充分证明了。
    旧中国资产阶级当权的时候，他们怎么会想到这些事情？农民没有土地，在贫困的生活下怎么能与疾病作斗争？
    今天要基本消灭这些疾病的保证是什么？最根本的保证：就是社会主义优越的制度为科学的高度发展提供了有利的条件，利用先进的科学是可以战胜这些疾病的。目前广大农村开始进入社会主义社会，农民迫切地要求消灭这些病，他们有参加这个运动的极高的热情。所以我们能在党的领导下顺利地进行这一工作。党给我们指示方针，给我们组织力量，广大的中医、西医在党的教育下，已大大进步了。医学科学家们积极地进行科学研究工作。我们已经有了预防的法办，有治疗的药品，一面防，一面治，人民群众、医务人员一齐下手，经过一段时间，一定可以基本消灭。现在有的地区，经过研究之后，有的规定六年可以消灭，五年可以消灭，而有的在两年内就可消灭。
    在这里，我向各位提出一个要求：多多帮助卫生工作，多多向人民群众宣传卫生知识，使旧社会留下来的那些无知识、迷信、不卫生的情况，迅速改变过来，把我们的国家建设成一个具有高度文化、文明、卫生的国家！
