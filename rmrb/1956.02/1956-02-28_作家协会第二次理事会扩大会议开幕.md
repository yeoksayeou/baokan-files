    Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writer's Association, said in his opening remarks that since the first council meeting held in October 1953, our country has undergone earth-shaking changes, and our literary cause has also developed.

    At this morning's meeting, Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the Writer's Association, delivered a report entitled "The Task of Building Socialist Literature." This report summarized the ideological struggles and creative achievements made on the literary and artistic front since the first council meeting of the Writer's Association, as well as the main problems that exist, and put forward opinions on future work.

    At this afternoon's meeting, Mao Dun, Chairman of the Writer's Association, delivered a report entitled "Cultivating New Forces, Expanding the Literary Ranks," and Lao She, Vice Chairman of the Writer's Association, delivered a report on the literary work of fraternal ethnic groups.

    The meeting is scheduled to last for 7 days and will discuss relevant reports and make corresponding resolutions.
