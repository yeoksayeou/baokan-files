Soviet Experts Serving China's Health Cause
Liu Ying

In recent years, with the rapid advance of socialist construction, the national health care system has continuously achieved new successes. These achievements are inseparable from the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts. For the happiness of the Chinese people, Soviet experts have made great efforts, putting forward hundreds of suggestions for China's health cause. These suggestions demonstrate the high scientific level of the Soviet experts, but what is especially touching is their high degree of enthusiasm for the Chinese people. The Soviet experts of the Ministry of Health, led by Professor Polderev, put forward more than 30 suggestions for China's health care cause in one year and ten months. Professor Polderev, the head of the expert group, is an old man over 50 years old and often suffers from illness. However, in order to help us eliminate schistosomiasis in the Yangtze River basin, he concealed his back pain and arm pain last winter and spent 29 days conducting investigations and research in cities and villages in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Qingpu, Gaoyou, and other places. His observations in every place were meticulous. He wanted to thoroughly understand even a small problem. The old expert cherished every minute of time for the health of the Chinese people and wrote a suggestion of more than 20,000 words - Comprehensive Measures to Eliminate Schistosomiasis.

Utai is a Soviet female expert. Once, in order to solve a hygiene problem in urban planning, she had to go to the remote mountains hundreds of miles away to conduct on-the-spot inspections of water sources. Utai rode a donkey prepared by the local government, which was a first for her in her life. The mountain road became more and more difficult to walk. Finally, at the edge of the mountain, the donkey could not go any further, and she had to climb the mountain on foot. Everyone advised her not to go. But Utai solemnly asked everyone, "What did I come here for?" "Without personally going to the site for investigation and research, no opinion can be put forward." After careful investigation, she finally solved the water source problem for the city, improved the city's sanitary environment, and turned those barren lands into fertile fields. After Akimochkina, an ophthalmology expert from the Beijing Red Cross Hospital, came to China, she took on all the clinical work of ophthalmology in the hospital and the task of training Chinese doctors. Her daily working hours exceeded more than twice that in her own country. However, when she discovered in her clinical work that trachoma seriously endangered the health of the Chinese people and affected production, she took time out of her busy schedule to lead Chinese doctors to go deep into kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, universities, and rural areas for detailed investigation and analysis and put forward specific suggestions for the prevention and treatment of trachoma to the Ministry of Health and the Chinese Ophthalmological Society. Miloserdova, an industrial hygiene expert of the Ministry of Health, is an enthusiastic and outgoing young woman. In order to help us carry out hygiene work in factories and mines, she traveled all over the important factories and mines in Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, and other places in Northeast China, went deep into the workers to understand the workers' working environment and health conditions, and understood the relationship between local health institutions and factories and mines. After such in-depth investigation, she put forward a plan for our industrial hygiene.

Soviet experts often say: "You can't treat me as a guest. The Soviet Union and China are in the same socialist family. Building this family is everyone's business." Soviet comrades spare no effort for our work. Professor Kosche, a Soviet oral expert from Beijing Medical College, worked more than 15 hours a day after coming to China, and sometimes he had to work 12 hours on Sundays. The Chinese comrades tried every means to let him rest more, but he always refused. He said, "When I see that my work can bring benefits to China, I feel the greatest happiness and joy." Professor Alexandrov, a pediatric expert who came to China, worked in three units in Beijing. In order to save time, she sometimes didn't go to the cafeteria to eat, but ate bread at home while working. Comrade Lezusshkina, a Soviet maternal and child health expert in her 50s from the Ministry of Health, went west to the Inner Mongolia grasslands and east to the Bohai Plain to investigate maternal and child health work for the sake of the happiness of mothers and children in our country.

Soviet experts in hospitals have not only solved many complex technical problems for us but also set a brilliant example of revolutionary humanitarianism for us. Many Soviet doctors in the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital always personally take care of critically ill patients who have not yet been out of danger, sometimes sitting beside critically ill patients and guarding them all night long. In order to help some seriously ill patients recover quickly, Soviet doctors personally helped patients practice walking in the ward. Yermagova, an obstetrics and gynecology expert from Harbin Central Hospital, transfused 200 cc of her own blood to a woman with dystocia who was sent from afar to save her life. Comrade Chelinil, a Soviet female doctor from Dalian Alkali Plant, heard that a woman who was 6 months pregnant was seriously ill on a stormy noon, so she immediately rushed to the patient's home in the rain. After her careful examination, it was determined to be "bone tuberculosis" and must be sent to the hospital for treatment. The next day, as soon as it dawned, she personally escorted the patient to the hospital by car. In the hospital, Comrade Chelinil personally helped the patient from the internal medicine, surgery, laboratory to the X-ray room for blood tests, urine tests, fluoroscopy, until finally arranging the patient in the ward. Under her care, the patient quickly turned from danger to safety.

The Soviet experts mentioned above are only a part of the many Soviet experts in the health department, and their contributions to China's health care cause are not limited to the above. However, just this part of the deeds can give us profound and vivid internationalist education, so that we deeply understand the preciousness of Sino-Soviet friendship. This precious friendship will emit brilliant light in the cause of human peace through the increasingly close relationship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    为我国卫生事业服务的苏联专家
    刘瑛
    几年来，全国卫生保健事业随着社会主义建设的突飞猛进，不断地出现着新的成就。这些成就是和苏联专家对我们的热情帮助分不开的。苏联专家为了中国人民的幸福，付出了巨大的劳动，他们为我国的卫生事业提出了数以百计的建议，这些建议显示了苏联专家们高度的科学水平，但尤其感人的是他们对中国人民的高度的热情。以波尔德列夫教授为首的卫生部的苏联专家们，在一年零十个月的时间内，为我国的卫生保健事业提出了30多项建议。专家组长波尔德列夫教授是一个年过50的老人，身体还常带着病，可是他为了帮助我们消灭长江流域的血吸虫病，在去年冬天，隐瞒着自己的腰疼和胳膊痛病，花了29天的时间，在南京、上海、杭州、扬州、镇江、无锡、青浦、高邮等地的城市和乡村进行了调查研究。他在每一个地方的观察都是细致入微的，那怕是一个微小的问题，他都要彻底弄清。老专家为了我国人民的健康，珍惜着每一分钟的时间。为我们写成了20，000多字的建议书——消灭血吸虫病综合措施。
    乌泰是一位苏联女专家，有一次她为了解决一个城市规划中的卫生问题，要到百里之外的深山中去实地勘察水源。乌泰骑上了当地政府准备的毛驴，这对她来说还是生平第一次。山路越来越难走，最后到了山的边缘，毛驴也不能走了，必须徒步向山上爬。大家劝她不要去了。可是乌泰严肃地反问大家：“我干什么来了呢？”“不亲自到实地去调查研究，是不能提出任何意见的。”经过她仔细勘察，最后为我们解决了那个城市的水源问题，使城市的卫生环境为之改观，并且可使那些荒芜了的土地变为良田。北京红十字医院眼科专家阿基莫奇金娜来到中国以后，担负了医院中眼科的全部临床工作及培养中国医生的任务，每日的工作时间超过了她在国内的两倍以上，可是当她在临床工作中发现了沙眼严重危害着中国人民的健康、影响着生产的时候，她就从百忙中抽出时间来领导中国医生深入到幼儿园、小学、中学、大学里，深入到农村里，进行了细致的调查分析。并向卫生部、中华眼科学会提出了防治沙眼的具体建议。卫生部工业卫生专家米洛谢尔陀娃是一个热情奔放的青年女同志，她为了帮助我们开展工矿中的卫生工作，跑遍了东北的沈阳、鞍山、抚顺等地的重要厂矿，深入到工人中去了解工人的作业环境和健康情况，了解地方卫生机构和厂矿的关系。经过她这样的深入考察，她为我们的工业卫生提出了规划。
    苏联专家经常这样说：“你们不能把我当作客人，苏联、中国同在一个社会主义大家庭里，建设这个大家庭是我们大家的事。”苏联同志们为了我们的工作是不遗余力的。北京医学院苏联口腔专家科斯赫教授来到中国以后，每天的工作达15小时以上，有时在星期天也要工作12小时。中国的同志想尽一切办法让他多休息一下，但他总是拒绝。他说：“当我看到我的工作能给中国带来好处的时候，我就感觉到最大的幸福和快乐。”到中国来的小儿科专家亚历山大洛娃教授，她在北京兼着3个单位的工作。为了节省时间，她有时就不到食堂里去吃饭，而在家里一面啃着面包，一面还在工作。卫生部50多岁的苏联妇幼专家列兹乌施基娜同志，为了我国的母亲和孩子们的幸福，她西到内蒙古草原，东到渤海平原去考察妇幼卫生工作。
      医院中的苏联专家们，不仅为我们解决了许多复杂的技术问题，而且为我们树立了革命人道主义的光辉榜样。北京苏联红十字医院的许多苏联医生对未脱离危险期的重患者，总是亲自护理，有时坐在重症患者的身旁守一整夜。为了让一些重病患者很快恢复行走，苏联医生亲自扶着病人在病房里锻炼走路。哈尔滨中央医院的妇产科专家耶尔马果娃为了挽救从远道送来的一个难产妇女，就把自己身上的血给她输了200西西，拯救了她的生命。大连碱厂的苏联女医生车里尼尔同志，在一个狂风暴雨的中午，听说一个怀孕6个月的妇女得了重病，她就立即冒雨赶到患病者的家里。经过她的仔细检查，断定是“骨结核”，必须送医院进行治疗。第二天，天刚刚发亮，她就亲自用汽车护送病人到了医院。在医院里，车里尼尔同志又亲自扶着病人从内科、外科、化验室到爱克斯光室、进行验血、验大小便、透视，直到最后把病人安置到病房里。病人在她的关怀照料下很快就转危为安了。
    以上提到的这些苏联专家，只不过是卫生部门许多苏联专家中的一部分专家，他们为我国卫生保健事业所作的贡献也不仅仅是上面说的这一点。但是，仅仅是这一部分事迹，就可以使我们获得深刻而生动的国际主义教育，使我们深深地懂得中苏友谊的珍贵，这种珍贵的友谊将通过中苏两国人民的日益亲密的关系而在人类的和平事业中发出灿烂的光辉。
