    Liu Qiong's Speech
    (1) The ideological situation of technical personnel:
    Regardless of those retained from before liberation or those who graduated from universities or specialized colleges after liberation, with the exception of reactionary elements, all love the motherland and have a sense of purpose.
    They do not slacken in their study of their own business, but they do not pay enough attention to political study, and rarely read political books in their spare time.
    Older technical personnel are generally afraid of becoming leaders, for no more than the following two reasons:
    (1) They are not in the organization themselves, and they fear that if they become leaders, they will have the title but no real power, making it difficult to advance their work.
    (2) They are afraid of being excessively punished if they make a mistake.
    New technical personnel have a strong desire for knowledge. They are willing to intern in various departments, and unwilling to engage in purely professional work. They are most willing to engage in hyper-deterministic structures, believing that they cannot learn anything from old-fashioned stereotypes.
    (2) The relationship between technical personnel and Party workers:
    Older technical personnel rarely approach Party workers except for business matters. There is an invisible gap between them, and neither side understands the other.
    Most of the new technical personnel are members of the Communist Youth League and are led by the League branch, so they are quite close to Party workers.
    (3) Work aspects:
    Older technical personnel are mostly in a passive position in their work, their enthusiasm is not high, and they generally lack the fighting spirit to uphold the truth.
    Most new technical personnel are highly enthusiastic in their work, but their consideration of problems is not thorough enough, they lack comprehensiveness, their enthusiasm is high, and a few have the fighting spirit to uphold the truth.
    (4) General feelings:
    Both old and new technical personnel feel that their spare time is spent either in meetings or studying politics, and they do not have enough time or a sufficiently quiet environment to study the Soviet technical sciences published in large numbers and to read the suggestions from Soviet experts sent by various fraternal design institutes to improve their own technical level.
    (5) The views of Party workers on older technical personnel are divided into two types:
    (1) Overestimating them, believing that older technical personnel are omnipotent. In this way, it is easy to become the tail of the technical personnel in their work. For example, if a technical person says that bridge pier foundations cannot be built during floods, he forgets the often-said phrase "do not bow to difficulties" and agrees to the technical person's opinion without principle.
    (2) Underestimating them, believing that technical personnel are nothing great, holding a contemptuous attitude, and distrusting them. No matter how big or small the matter is, they must ask Soviet experts. In this case, the experts spend most of their time busy with trivial matters, and major issues are delayed. In this way, it is easy to cause huge losses in work.
    (6) Shortcomings of technical personnel:
    (1) More or less remaining bourgeois ideological remnants, especially among older technical personnel.
    (2) The purely technical viewpoint is still strong.
    (3) Rarely self-criticism, and also unwilling to criticize others face-to-face.
    (4) Remaining petty-bourgeois weakness, wanting to say something in their hearts but not having the courage to say it at meetings, or even saying one thing but meaning another.
    (7) Recommendations:
    In combination with the above points, the following recommendations are made:
    (1) In employing people, we must adhere to the principle of "if you trust people, use them; if you distrust people, do not use them." If you recognize that someone is both talented and virtuous and employ them, you should authorize them.
    (2) In strengthening the leadership of technical personnel in raising their political level, Party workers should often discuss relatively large issues (not necessarily technical) with technical personnel in one place, listen to their opinions, adopt correct ones, and help correct incorrect ones.
    (3) Understand the difficulties in the lives of technical personnel and help solve them within the possible range (for example, if a technical person has 80-year-old parents and a wife in her 50s, and they are assigned to a three-story building without an elevator, they will not be able to live in it), so that they feel warmth.
    (4) In spare time, provide enough time and a sufficiently quiet environment for them to concentrate on studying their business and improve their technical level.
    (5) For political study, on the basis of the existing political knowledge of technical personnel, designate several types of political books and reference books, allowing them to choose the better ones themselves. In this way, the study of politics is still systematic, and the effect is greater under the principle of self-selection and willingness.
    (6) Technical personnel themselves should take the initiative to enrich their political knowledge, eliminate the remaining bourgeois ideology, learn from the selfless workers, attach the same importance to raising their political level as to raising their technical level, so as to be a good people's engineer and be respected by the people; otherwise, if they do not advance, they will retreat, and their situation will deteriorate day by day, and the result will be elimination, which is detrimental to both public and private interests.

    刘琼的发言
    （一）技术人员思想情况：
    无论留用的与解放后大学或专科毕业的技术人员，除反动分子外，无不热爱祖国，都是有事业心的。
    对本身业务的钻研都不放松，然对政治学习是不够重视的，暇时很少看政治书籍。
    旧有技术人员普遍的怕当领导，原因不外下列二种：
    （1）本身不在组织，怕当了领导有职无权，推进工作困难。
    （2）万一犯了错误怕受到过分的处罚。
    新的技术人员求知欲颇强。愿到各部门实习，不愿搞单纯的专业工作，最愿搞超定性结构，认为老套定型图学不到什么。
    （二）技术人员与党的工作者的关系：
    旧的技术人员除业务外，很少与党的工作者接近，其中无形有一条鸿沟，双方互不了解。
    新的技术人员大多数是青年团员，受团总支的领导，故与党的工作者颇接近。
    （三）工作方面：
    旧有技术人员工作多处于被动地位，积极性不高，多缺乏坚持真理的斗争心。
    新的技术人员工作热情大部分是高的，惟考虑问题不够周详，缺乏综合性，积极性高，少数的坚持真理有斗争心。
    （四）一般的感觉：
    无论新旧都感觉到业余时间不是开会就是学习政治，无适当时间及适当清静环境研究源源出版的苏联技术科学与阅读各兄弟设计院寄来的苏联专家的建议，来提高本身技术水平。
    （五）党的工作者对旧有技术人员的看法，分两种类型：
    （1）估计过高，认为旧有技术人员是万能的，如此，工作中很容易形成为技术人员的尾巴，如技术人员说洪水时不能修桥墩基础，他忘记了经常说的“不向困难低头”这句话，无原则的同意了技术人员的意见。
    （2）估计过低，认为技术人员没有什么了不起，抱着轻视态度，信任不专，事不分巨细都要问苏联专家，则专家大部分时间忙于琐细问题，重大问题反拖延下去了，如此工作中易造成巨大损失。
    （六）技术人员的缺点：
    （1）多少存有资产阶级残余的思想，其中以旧的技术人员为甚。
    （2）单纯技术观点仍是浓厚。
    （3）很少自我批评，也不愿当面批评旁人。
    （4）存有小资产阶级的软弱性，心里想说的开会时没有勇气讲，甚至于口是心非的讲一套。
    （七）建议：
    结合上列各点建议如下：
    （1）用人要抱定用人不疑，疑人不用，如果认其人才德兼备而用时就应授权与他。
    （2）在加强技术人员提高政治水平领导中，党的工作者遇有比较大的问题（不一定属于技术性的）与技术人员经常在一处讨论，听取他们意见，正确的采纳，不正确的加以帮助纠正。
    （3）了解技术人员生活中的困难问题，在可能范围以内代为解决（如技术人员有80岁的父母，50余岁的妻子，在分配房子时将其分到无电梯的三层楼，这样他是无法住在其内的），使其感觉温暖。
    （4）业余时间，与以足够的时间及适当清静的环境，使其能专心钻研业务，提高其技术水平。
    （5）政治学习，以在技术人员现有的政治知识基础上，指定若干种政治书籍及参考书，令其自择较佳，如此，则学习政治仍是有系统的，而是在自选自愿的原则下，收效较大。
    （6）技术人员本身应主动的充实自己政治知识的修养，清除残余的资产阶级思想，向忘我劳动的工人看齐，把提高政治水平与提高技术水平一样重视，方能作一个良好的人民工程师，受到人民的尊重，否则不进则退，江河日下，结果必受淘汰，公私两方皆属不利。
