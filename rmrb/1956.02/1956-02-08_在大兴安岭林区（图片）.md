    In the Great Khingan Mountains Forest Area
    Mechanization is gradually being implemented in the Great Khingan Mountains forest area. To facilitate tractor transport of timber, forestry workers in the Inner Mongolia Great Khingan Mountains forest area have poured artificial ice roads from the forest to the timber yard. The upper picture shows a tractor pulling a train of ice sleds fully loaded with timber, traveling on the ice road.
    In the Inner Mongolia Great Khingan Mountains forest area, many activists in socialist construction have emerged. Weng En, a Mongolian youth, Communist Party member, and timber truck driver, has consistently overfulfilled his tasks since the winter transport season began. The right picture shows Weng En and his truck adorned with a "Glory Flower."

    在大兴安岭林区
    大兴安岭林区作业逐步走向机械化。为了便利拖拉机运输木材，林业工人在内蒙古大兴安岭林区由森林到贮木场浇筑了人造冰道。上图是拖拉机拖着一列满载木材的冰橇行驶在冰道上。
    在内蒙古大兴安岭林区里，涌现出不少社会主义建设积极分子。运材汽车司机、蒙古族青年、共产党员悟恩，自冬运以来经常超额完成任务。右图是悟恩和他所驾驶的挂着光荣花的汽车。
