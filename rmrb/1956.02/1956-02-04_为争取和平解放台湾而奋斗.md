    In the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai called on the Taiwan compatriots and all Kuomintang military and government personnel who fled from the mainland to Taiwan to stand on the banner of patriotism and join the people of the motherland in striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the complete unification of the motherland. Premier Zhou Enlai also announced on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government: All Kuomintang military and government personnel who have fled to Taiwan and overseas can return to the mainland to visit relatives and friends if they wish. Those who wish to come to the mainland for visits and study are also welcome. All those who are willing to take the path of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, no matter who they are, no matter how great their past crimes, the Chinese people will treat them with leniency and will not hold them accountable for their past actions. All those who have performed meritorious service in the action of peaceful liberation of Taiwan will be rewarded according to the magnitude of their merits by the Chinese people. All those who come over to the motherland through peaceful means will be given appropriate employment by the Chinese people.
    This call and declaration fully demonstrate the heartfelt concern of the Chinese people and the Chinese government for the fate of the 8 million Taiwan compatriots under foreign military rule, and point out a bright path for all Kuomintang military and government personnel who have fled to Taiwan and overseas.
    For the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan and overseas, the only way out is to liberate Taiwan through peaceful means and return the Taiwan compatriots to the embrace of the motherland. Their situation of relying on the United States to eke out a precarious existence cannot last long. In the end, they will either fail with the United States or be sacrificed.
    As Premier Zhou Enlai said, the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, and Taiwan will inevitably return to the motherland. This is an inevitable trend. First, Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and the people of Taiwan are an inseparable part of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are determined to carry the struggle to liberate Taiwan through to the end, so that Taiwan will return to the motherland and achieve the complete unification of the motherland. We will never stop until we reach our goal. Second, the Chinese people have full confidence in their own strength. With the development of our socialist construction, our economic and defense capabilities are constantly growing. Everyone can see: how can 150 kilometers of sea become an impassable barrier for the People's Liberation Army, and what strength does the Chiang Kai-shek clique have to stop the People's Liberation Army's attack? Third, the main reason why Taiwan has not yet been liberated is that the United States occupies this place. However, the United States' occupation of Taiwan has created a tense situation in the Taiwan region and an international dispute between China and the United States. The United States has therefore placed itself in a very isolated position, and has been criticized by all fair-minded public opinion in the world and opposed by all peace-loving people. This policy of the United States is doomed to failure. Therefore, as Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out, there are only two paths before the Kuomintang military and government personnel: one is to continue to follow the United States, so that the Taiwan compatriots will continue to suffer foreign enslavement, and at the same time put themselves on a dead end with no hope of survival; the other is to awaken to the truth, arouse their patriotic conscience, liberate Taiwan through peaceful means, so that the Taiwan compatriots can return to the embrace of the motherland, and also give themselves the opportunity to perform meritorious service for the motherland and be forgiven by the people of the motherland. All Kuomintang military and government personnel who care about their future must choose one of these two paths sooner or later. Now is the time for them to make a firm decision.
    Among the Kuomintang military and government personnel, anyone who still has a patriotic conscience should know that the liberation of Taiwan, no matter what method is adopted, is an internal affair of our country. In addition to using war, the Chinese people are fully capable of resolving this internal affair of China by peaceful means, just as Beijing, Suiyuan, Hunan, Xinjiang, and Tibet were liberated by peaceful means during the liberation of the mainland. And the people of the whole country, including the people of the mainland and the people of Taiwan, unite to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, so that the Chinese people can solve this internal affair of China themselves, and no third party is allowed to interfere. This is a common and lofty patriotic task of all Chinese people. The Kuomintang military and government personnel should arouse their conscience, stand on the banner of patriotism, liberate Taiwan through peaceful means, and help the people of the motherland eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan region. Doing so, as Premier Zhou Enlai said, will not only perform meritorious service for the motherland, but also contribute to peace in Asia and the world.
    Among the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan, there are many who once had ambitions and ideals for the future of their motherland. These ideals and ambitions have never been realized in the past, nor can they be realized. And now in mainland China, the Chinese people are engaged in a world-shaking socialist construction cause under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. China's international status has undergone fundamental changes compared to before the liberation of the mainland, and it has become one of the major countries in the world. The prosperous and happy life that the Chinese people have long dreamed of is gradually being realized in China today. As long as the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan can awaken to the truth and return to the motherland, they can contribute their share to the great construction cause of the motherland, not only to find a place to settle down, but also to be worthy of the motherland and the people of the motherland, and worthy of their ancestors and descendants. All Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan must now think deeply: do they want to become sinners of the nation, to be唾骂 by future generations and even their own descendants, or to return to the embrace of the motherland, to receive the motherland's forgiveness and warmth, and to become a member of the motherland's big family?
    Taiwan compatriots! The motherland has issued a warm call to you, asking you to work for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and for the return of Taiwan to the motherland. The motherland is very concerned about your current difficult situation and is working to liberate you as soon as possible. The motherland is waiting for you to participate in the great socialist construction, to participate in the extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done.
    All Kuomintang military and government personnel who have fled from the mainland to Taiwan and overseas! The motherland has opened its broad heart to you, welcoming you to return to the embrace of the motherland through peaceful means. The roads to the motherland are open to you, and you should no longer have any hesitation or doubt.
    Let us unite under the banner of patriotism and strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, for the completion of the unification cause of the motherland, and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world!

    为争取和平解放台湾而奋斗
    在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次会议上，周恩来总理号召台湾同胞和一切从大陆上跑到台湾的国民党军政人员，站到爱国主义的旗帜下来，同祖国人民一起，为争取和平解放台湾、实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗。周恩来总理并且代表中国人民和中国政府宣布：一切跑到台湾和海外的国民党军政人员，凡是愿意回到大陆省亲会友的，都可以回到大陆上来。凡是愿意到大陆来参观和学习的，也都可以到大陆上来。凡是愿意走和平解放台湾道路的，不管任何人，也不管过去犯有多大罪过，中国人民都将宽大对待，不究既往。凡是在和平解放台湾这个行动中立了功的，中国人民都将按照立功大小给以应得的奖励。凡是通过和平途径投向祖国的，中国人民都将在工作上给以适当的安置。
    这个号召和宣告，充分表现了中国人民和中国政府对于处在外国武力统治下的800万台湾同胞的命运的衷心关怀，并且给一切跑到台湾和海外的国民党军政人员指出了一条光明大道。
    对于在台湾和海外的国民党军政人员来说，通过和平途径解放台湾，使台湾同胞回到祖国的怀抱，是他们唯一的出路。他们依靠美国苟延残喘的局面是不能持久的。到头来他们不是跟着美国失败，就是被人牺牲。
    正如周恩来总理所说，中国人民一定要解放台湾，台湾必然要归还祖国，这是势所必至。第一，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，台湾人民是中国人民不可分离的一部分，中国人民有决心把解放台湾的斗争进行到底，以便使台湾归还祖国，实现祖国的完全统一。不达目的，决不休止。第二，中国人民对自己的力量有充分的信心。随着我国社会主义建设事业的发展，我国经济实力和国防实力正在不断增长。人人都可以看到：150公里海面如何能够成为人民解放军不能跨越的天堑，蒋介石集团又有什么力量能够阻挡得住人民解放军的进攻。第三，台湾至今不能获得解放的主要原因是美国霸占了这块地方。但是，美国霸占了台湾，这就造成了台湾地区的紧张局势和中美两国之间的国际争端。美国已因此而使自己陷于十分孤立的地位，受到全世界一切公正舆论的指责和一切爱好和平的人民的反对。美国这种政策是注定了要失败的。因此，正如周恩来总理所指出的，在国民党军政人员面前只有两条路：一条是继续追随美国，使台湾同胞继续遭受外国的奴役，同时也使自己走上死亡无日的绝路；一条是幡然悔悟，激发爱国良心，通过和平途径解放台湾，使台湾同胞回到祖国怀抱，也使自己获得为祖国立功、得到祖国人民宽恕的机会。一切关心自己前途的国民党军政人员，迟早必须在这两条道路中选择一条。现在是他们痛下决心的时候了。
    国民党军政人员中，任何还有爱国良心的人，应当知道：台湾的解放不论采用什么方式都是我国内部的事务。中国人民除了用战争方式以外，也完全有可能用和平的方式自己来解决这个属于中国内部的事务，就像在大陆解放的时候北京、绥远、湖南、新疆、西藏等地方用和平方式得到解放一样。而全国人民，包括大陆人民和台湾人民，团结起来，争取用和平方式解放台湾，由中国人民自己来解决这个中国内部的事务，不许第三者加以干涉，这是全中国人民的一种共同的崇高的爱国主义的任务。国民党军政人员应当激发良心，站到这个爱国主义的旗帜下来，通过和平方式解放台湾，帮助祖国人民消除台湾地区紧张局势。这样做，正如周恩来总理所说，就不但对祖国立了功勋，而且对亚洲和世界和平作了贡献。
    在台湾的国民党军政人员中，有不少人对于自己的祖国的前途曾经是有抱负、有理想的。他们这种理想和抱负过去从来没有实现过，也不可能实现。而现在在中国大陆上，中国人民正在中国共产党领导之下从事着惊天动地的社会主义的建设事业。中国的国际地位比之解放大陆以前已经发生了根本改变，成了世界上的大国之一。中国人民长期以来梦想的繁荣幸福生活，今天正在中国的土地上逐步实现。在台湾的国民党军政人员只要能幡然悔悟，回到祖国，就能在祖国的伟大建设事业中尽他们的一分力量，不但使自己得到安身立命之所，也可以不愧对祖国和祖国人民，不愧对自己的祖先和后代。在台湾的一切国民党军政人员现在必须深思猛省：他们愿意使自己成为民族的罪人，遭到后世甚至他们自己的子孙的唾骂呢，还是回到祖国的怀抱里来，获得祖国的宽恕和温暖，成为祖国大家庭中的一员？
    台湾的同胞们！祖国已经向你们发出了热情的召唤，要求你们为台湾的和平解放、为使台湾归还祖国而努力。祖国十分关怀你们目前的痛苦处境，并且正在为使你们早日得到解放而努力。祖国在等待着你们参加伟大的社会主义建设，参加我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。
    一切从大陆上跑到台湾和海外的国民党军政人员们！祖国已经向你们敞开了宽大的胸怀，欢迎你们通过和平途径回到祖国的怀抱里来。在你们面前，通向祖国的条条大路都是打开着的，你们再也不应该有任何犹豫和怀疑了。
    让我们在爱国主义的旗帜下，团结一致，为台湾的和平解放，为完成祖国的统一事业和保卫亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗吧！
