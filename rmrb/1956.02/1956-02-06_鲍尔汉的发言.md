    Bawerhan's Speech
    Chairman, fellow members, comrades:
    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the various reports made by Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Dong Biwu, and Committee Member Chen Boda.
    In his political report, Chairman Zhou Enlai sincerely expressed to peace-loving people around the world the Chinese people's continued position of striving for the relaxation of the international situation and the consolidation of world peace. At the same time, he solemnly expressed the Chinese people's determination to resolutely strike a heavy blow to the American aggressive bloc that dares to engage in war adventures. The Chinese people, who had long been in colonial and semi-colonial disasters, finally, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, were liberated from the struggle against colonial rule and took control of their own destiny. The emergence of New China in Asia has further consolidated and strengthened the forces of the socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the Chinese people have played a particularly important role in all international affairs. This makes us deeply realize that being a citizen of New China is an infinite honor and pride. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, initiated by our Premier Zhou together with the Prime Ministers of India and Burma, and supported by the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and many other countries, have become the准则 (zhǔnzé - norm) for handling international affairs and are further embodied in the "Bandung Spirit." All this fully demonstrates the Chinese people's love of peace and their desire for a long-term international peaceful environment to build their own happy lives.
    The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang after liberation also urgently need a peaceful environment to carry out socialist construction together with the people of the whole country. Therefore, on behalf of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the CPPCC, I express my firm support for Chairman Zhou Enlai's report, actively support the world's people's peace movement, and wage a resolute struggle against American aggressive and war policies.
    We were very excited after discussing the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" for 1956 to 1967 proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It outlines the goals that the people of the whole country, especially the 500 million farmers, should strive for on the road to socialism, and accelerates the process of the great motherland moving towards socialism.
    Although Xinjiang is a remote multi-ethnic region of the motherland, it borders the great Soviet Union. More than 20 years ago, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao sent many outstanding Communist Party members to work in order to help the ethnic minorities. Since then, the Party has sown the seeds of revolution among the people of all ethnic groups. In the six years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, due to the influence and promotion of advanced examples such as the increasing production and bumper harvests of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang over the years, and the selfless assistance of the great friendly country of the Soviet Union, the people of all ethnic groups have further recognized their great future. Like the farmers of all ethnic groups, especially the Han farmers, they enthusiastically demanded agricultural cooperation and vigorous development of production. According to the statistical data of 19 agricultural cooperatives in Kucha, Baicheng, Xinhe, and Awat counties in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the wheat yield in 1955 was 27% higher than that of mutual aid groups and 48% higher than that of individual farming. According to the national first five-year plan, the agricultural production of the entire autonomous region will complete the 1957 target in 1956. The total grain output in 1956 will exceed the 14 million jin stipulated in the National Planning Commission's 1957 opinion, and cotton will exceed 880,000 jin. When Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was first published, a high tide of socialist revolution was immediately set off in the rural areas of Xinjiang. The enthusiasm of farmers to automatically apply to join or establish cooperatives was even higher than during the land reform. Twelve farmers in Heizi Township, Baicheng County, who automatically applied to establish a cooperative but were not approved, complained, "The farmers who have already established cooperatives are Chairman Mao's own sons, are we Chairman Mao's step-sons?"
    Before the spring plowing this year, there were 8,500 new and old cooperatives in the entire region, and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives reached about 45% of the total number of farmers. After another wave of cooperative construction this autumn and winter, there may be 14,000 new and old cooperatives in the entire region, reaching 70% of the total number of farmers, and strive to reach 85%, basically completing the primary form of cooperation. By 1958 or at the latest 1959, the advanced form of cooperation can be basically completed.
    Xinjiang has strong potential for agricultural production and livestock development. There are currently 24.65 million mu of cultivated land, and about 120 million mu of wasteland. There are 84 large and small rivers and canals with an average flow of 1,920 cubic meters per second. According to preliminary surveys, the total amount of river water and groundwater is 82.5 billion cubic meters, which can irrigate approximately 110 million mu. Especially under the new situation of vigorously developing industry and agriculture after the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, this requires a large number of immigrants from various parts of the country to Xinjiang to carry out various production and construction activities. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang warmly welcome the great assistance of the Han elder brother.
    Xinjiang has land, water, vast grasslands, and abundant underground resources. Based on these objective favorable conditions, it is certain that we can complete the production targets stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program."
    Early on, scholars from capitalist countries went to Xinjiang for investigation and believed that the snow water of the Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains would gradually decrease year by year, predicting that Xinjiang might completely become a desert after a few years. This is a subjective idealist viewpoint with no scientific basis. According to the experience of Soviet construction and the development of science, any desert can be turned into an oasis.
    Intellectuals are extremely valuable and extremely lacking talents in Xinjiang. In the six years since liberation, with the development of the political, economic, and cultural aspects of all ethnic groups, the number of intellectuals has increased year by year, and they have played a great role in various construction undertakings. In the future, in addition to resolutely implementing the three instructions on intellectuals in Chairman Zhou Enlai's report and vigorously training young experts, especially training young experts from ethnic minorities, we request that the central government provide strong support and necessary care in this regard, so that the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will strive to take a step forward in socialist construction and achieve a uniform pace with the people of the whole country.
    In the high tide of the socialist revolution of the great motherland, the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, who have gained the right to be masters of their own affairs, have taken great strides into socialism together with the people of the whole country. They will strive with even greater confidence to complete the various production targets stipulated by the central government in the Xinjiang region ahead of schedule and beyond quotas. At the same time, the people of all ethnic groups and all circles in Xinjiang will never forget the compatriots in Taiwan who are still suffering under the iron heel of American imperialism. The people of Xinjiang, with infinite loyalty, resolutely support the lenient policy solemnly announced by Chairman Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government towards the KMT military and political personnel who fled to Taiwan. People of some ethnic minorities who were lured and used or deceived by imperialism to flee abroad in the past should also quickly repent, inspire their patriotic conscience, and return to the embrace of the motherland.
    The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will unite more closely and further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, consolidate the alliance of workers, farmers, and intellectuals, and consolidate the people's democratic united front together with the people of the whole country. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will fight against enemies at home and abroad; fight for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the complete reunification of the motherland; and fight for the continued relaxation of the international situation and the consolidation of world peace.

    鲍尔汉的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和李济深副主席、郭沫若副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武副主席以及陈伯达委员所做的各项报告。
    周恩来主席在他的政治报告中向全世界爱好和平的人民诚挚地表明了中国人民继续争取国际局势和缓和巩固世界和平的立场，同时也严正地表示了中国人民随时给予敢于进行战争冒险的美国侵略集团以沉重打击的决心。长期处于殖民地和半殖民地灾难深重的中国人民，经过了一百多年的流血牺牲，终于在中国共产党毛主席领导下，从反殖民统治的斗争中获得了解放，自己掌握了命运。新中国在亚洲的出现，进一步巩固和壮大了以苏联为首的社会主义和平民主阵营的力量，中国人民在一切国际事务中已起着特别重要的作用。这使我们深刻地意味到做一个新中国的公民有着无限的光荣和骄傲。我国周总理同印度和缅甸总理倡议并为苏联、南斯拉夫等许多国家所支持的和平共处的五项原则，已成了处理国际事务的准则，并进而在，“万隆精神”中体现出来。所有这一切都充分表明了中国人民热爱和平，需要长期的国际和平环境来建设自己幸福生活的心愿。
    解放后的新疆各族人民，他们也更为迫切需要和平环境同全国人民一道进行社会主义建设事业。因此，我代表政协新疆维吾尔自治区委员会，表示坚决拥护周恩来主席的报告，积极支持世界人民的和平运动，同美国侵略政策和战争政策进行坚决地斗争。
    我们讨论了中共中央政治局提出的“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”（草案）之后感到非常兴奋。它为全国人民特别是5亿农民规划出迈往社会主义应努力的目标，加速了伟大祖国走向社会主义的进程。
    新疆虽是祖国边远的多民族地区，但它与伟大苏联毗联。20多年前党中央毛主席为了帮助少数民族，即派往许多优秀共产党员进行工作。从那时起，党已在各族人民中撒下革命的种子。解放后六年多来，各族农民在党的领导下，由于驻新人民解放军历年增产丰收等先进事例的影响与推动，以及伟大友邦苏联无私的帮助，使各族人民进一步认识了自己的伟大前途。他们和各族农民特别是汉族农民一样，热情地要求农业合作化和大力发展生产。根据新疆维吾尔自治区库车、拜城、新和、阿瓦提四县19个农业社的统计材料，1955年小麦产量比互助组高27％，比单干高48％。全自治区农业生产按照国家第一个五年计划1956年即可完成1957年的指标。1956年粮食总产量将超过国家计划委员会规定1957年意见数的1，400多万斤，棉花将超过88万多斤。当毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”报告刚一发表时，新疆农村立即掀起了社会主义革命的高潮。农民自动申请入社或建社的情绪比土地改革时还高。拜城县黑子乡12户农民自动申请建社未被批准便抱怨地说：“已经建社的农民是毛主席的亲儿子，难道我们是毛主席的后儿子么？”
    今年春耕以前全区已有新、老社8，500 个，入社农户达总农户的45％左右。再经过今年秋、冬一个建社浪潮，全区可有新、老社14，000个，达总农户的70％，并争取达到85％，基本上完成初级形式的合作化。到1958年至迟到1959年即可基本上完成高级形式的合作化。
    新疆的农业生产和发展畜牧业有着雄厚的潜力，现有耕地2，465万亩，并有荒地约12，000万亩，共有大小河渠84条，平均流量1，920秒公方。根据初步调查，河水与地下水共825亿公方，可灌溉大约11，000多万亩。特别在兰新铁路通车后大力发展工业和农业的新形势下，这就需要从关内各地大量移民到新疆去进行各项生产建设。新疆各族人民是满腔热情地欢迎汉族老大哥的伟大帮助的。
    新疆有地，有水，有广阔的草原和丰富的地下蕴藏，根据这些客观上的有利条件，完成“全国农业发展纲要”所规定的生产指标是有把握的。
    早年曾有资本主义国家的学者去新疆考察，认为天山和昆仑山雪水将逐年减少，预言新疆在若干年后可能完全变为沙漠。这是毫无科学根据的主观唯心论的观点。根据苏联建设的经验和科学的发展，任何沙漠都可能变为绿洲。
    知识分子在新疆是极为可贵和极其缺乏的人材。解放六年多来，随着各族人民政治、经济、文化的发展，知识分子已逐年增加，他们在各项建设事业中发挥了很大的作用。我们今后除坚决贯彻周恩来主席报告中有关知识分子问题三项指示并大力培养青年专家，特别是培养少数民族的青年专家而外，要求中央在这方面给予大力支持和必要的照顾，使新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民在社会主义建设事业中极力赶前一步，与全国人民取得齐一的步调。
    在伟大祖国的社会主义革命高潮中，取得了当家作主权利的新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民，已与全国人民一道大踏步地迈进了社会主义。他们更将信心百倍地争取提早和超额完成中央规定在新疆地区的各项生产指标。与此同时，新疆各族各界人民也决不会忘记仍处在美帝国主义铁蹄蹂躏下长期深受灾难的台湾同胞。新疆人民以无限的忠诚，坚决拥护周恩来主席代表中国人民和中国政府庄重宣布对跑到台湾去的国民党军政人员的宽大政策。已往少数民族中某些被帝国主义引诱利用或受骗而逃亡国外的人们，也应迅速悔悟，激发爱国良心，重归祖国怀抱。
    新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民将更加亲密团结，与全国人民一道进一步巩固人民民主专政，巩固工人、农民、知识分子的联盟，巩固人民民主统一战线。在中国共产党毛主席的领导下，为反对内外敌人而奋斗；为争取和平解放台湾、完成祖国的完全统一而奋斗；为继续和缓国际局势和巩固世界和平而奋斗。
