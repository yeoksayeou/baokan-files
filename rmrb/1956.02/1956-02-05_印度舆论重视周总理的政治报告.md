Xinhua News Agency dispatch: "Free Press" stated in an editorial on February 2nd, regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal for a new Geneva conference to discuss the Indochina issue: "The necessity of holding such a conference is very obvious. From the day the Geneva Accords were signed, Premier Ngo Dinh Diem has been doing everything possible to make the terms of the Geneva Accords meaningless. He has been able to do this bad thing because he has received the active support of the US State Department and the tacit consent of the British Foreign Office."

Regarding the issue of nationwide general elections stipulated in the Geneva Accords, the editorial said: "Ngo Dinh Diem has no intention of holding nationwide general elections. The reason is simple: he fears the disaster he would encounter at the ballot box."

The editorial also said: "It is for the same reason that the Western bloc is not interested in the implementation of the agreement."

    印度舆论重视周总理的政治报告
    据新华社讯　“自由新闻”2月2日在社论中谈到周恩来总理提出的关于举行新的日内瓦会议以讨论印度支那问题的建议说：“举行这种会议的必要性是很明显的。从签订日内瓦协定的那一天起，吴庭艳总理一直在尽一切力量使日内瓦协定的条款失去意义。他所以能做成这种坏事，是因为他得到美国国务院的积极支持和英国外交部的默许。”
    在谈到日内瓦协定条文规定举行的全国范围的普选问题时，社论说：“吴庭艳无意举行全国范围的普选，原因很简单，就是他害怕在投票箱面前所遇到的灾祸。”
    社论又说：“正是由于同样的原因，西方集团对于协定的执行也不感到兴趣。”
