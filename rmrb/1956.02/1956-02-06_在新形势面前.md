Facing the New Situation
By our correspondent Gao Changren

In early January, the number of peasant households in Hunan Province that had joined cooperatives reached more than 64% of the total number of peasant households; 18 counties had already achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperation. With the great development of the cooperative movement, a new production upsurge emerged throughout the province. The organized peasants are all working enthusiastically to repair water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, formulate production plans, and purchase production materials. A large number of townships and cooperatives in each county have decided to complete the production increase targets of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and to formulate "Seven-Year Long-Range Plans". While building a large number of cooperatives in various places, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China began to investigate and research, make overall plans, and welcome the production upsurge. From January 5th to 13th, the Provincial Party Committee held an agricultural production conference. The conference was attended by the secretaries of local and county party committees and the persons in charge of relevant departments. At the meeting, the Provincial Party Committee analyzed the new situation in the countryside after the great development of cooperation. In addition to emphasizing that making every effort to consolidate existing agricultural production cooperatives is the key to achieving semi-socialist agricultural cooperation and increasing agricultural production throughout the province this year, it also proposed specific measures to complete the production targets of the Five-Year Plan in four years, and called on local party committees to conduct in-depth inspections of right-leaning conservative ideas and welcome the production upsurge.

At this meeting, after inspection, many party committee secretaries found that their guiding ideology could not keep up with the demands of the masses. For example, Gaoling District of Changsha County originally planned to repair more than 70,000 cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy, but when the masses took action, they completed more than 180,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Yong'an Township in Rucheng County established a large cooperative with more than 300 households. The masses demanded that they jointly build several large reservoirs to fight drought and requested to remove the field ridges to increase production; however, the county party secretary said that the masses were "dreaming." Under such circumstances, the phenomenon of "production enthusiasm with the county party committee not as good as the district party committee, the district party committee not as good as the township cadres, and the township cadres not as good as the masses" appeared.

After criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, the party committee secretaries in various places carefully analyzed the actual situation and production potential of their localities, and unanimously believed that the target of increasing grain production by 10% throughout the province this year (agricultural production cooperatives should increase production by 20% to 30%) proposed by the Provincial Party Committee could be achieved, and it was entirely justified to complete the agricultural production targets of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in four years. The county party committee secretaries of Nanxian, Huarong, Anxiang, Yuanjiang and other counties in the Dongting Lake area analyzed the favorable conditions for increasing production: (1) 80% of the farmers have joined the cooperatives, and labor efficiency can be increased by 30% to 50%. (2) The water conservancy in the lake area has been well repaired, and past water conservancy disputes have also been resolved. (3) Fertilizer has already been prepared. With these three conditions, a foundation has been laid for expanding double-cropping rice; expanding double-cropping rice can increase production, which has been proven by many years of experience. The original production plan of the Liling County Party Committee was to produce 770 catties of rice per mu; later it was increased to 800 catties. At this meeting, the county party committee analyzed the specific situation again and decided to strive for 200 dan of mixed fertilizer per mu, universally promote improved varieties, and adopt new technologies to basically eliminate insect pests, so that 90% of the fields can resist drought for 60 days, and then change 90% of the double-cropping rice from intercropping to continuous cropping. In this way, the county can reach 1,000 catties per mu this year.

Due to the changes in the rural situation, how to organize and lead large-scale collective production, give full play to the superiority of collective production, and give play to the potential of land and labor is the most important issue currently facing party committees at all levels. However, party committees at all levels lack specific experience in this area. In the new situation, many new problems will inevitably arise in the work; after repeated discussions, everyone is determined to go deep among the masses, investigate and research, cultivate typical examples, promote advanced experiences, rely on the enthusiasm of poor and lower-middle peasants, give play to the wisdom of the masses, discover problems, and solve problems.

At the meeting, party committees in various places revised and formulated their local overall plans with agricultural production increase as the main focus. The meeting decided that the province should produce more than 25 billion catties of grain this year; reach 800 catties per mu in 1962; and reach 1,000 catties per mu in 1967. This year, the province should create two 1,000-catty counties in Liling and Yuanjiang; each special zone should create a 1,000-catty district; each county should create a 1,000-catty township; each district should create a 1,000-catty cooperative; and each cooperative should create a 1,000-catty high-yield plot.

    在新形势面前
    本报记者　高长任
    一月上旬，湖南省入社农户已经达到总农户的64％以上；有18个县已经实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。随着合作化运动的大发展，全省范围内出现了一个新的生产高潮。组织起来的农民，都在热火朝天地修水利，积肥料，订生产计划，买生产资料。每个县都有大批的乡和社决定提前完成五年计划的增产指标，和制定“七年远景规划”。中共湖南省委在各地大批建社的同时，就着手调查研究，全面规划，迎接生产高潮。省委在1月5日到13日召开了农业生产会议。参加会议的有各地、县委书记和有关的各部门负责人。会上，省委分析了合作化大发展以后农村的新形势，除着重指出全力巩固现有的农业生产合作社是今年全省实现半社会主义农业合作化和农业增产的关键以外，还提出了四年完成五年计划各项生产指标的具体措施，号召各地党委深入检查右倾保守思想，迎接生产高潮。
    在这次会议上，经过检查，许多党委书记都发现自己的领导思想赶不上群众的要求。如长沙县高岭区原来计划修水利7万多土方，但是群众一行动起来，就完成了18万多土方。汝城县永安乡办了一个300多户的大社，群众要求联合修几个大型水库抗旱，并且要求挖掉田埂、增加生产；而县委书记却说群众是在“做梦”。在这种情况下，就出现了“生产积极性县委不如区委，区委不如乡干部，乡干部不如群众”的现象。
    经过批判右倾保守思想以后，各地党委书记认真分析了本地实际情况和增产潜力，一致认为省委提出的今年全省粮食增产一成（农业生产合作社要增产二成到三成）的指标是可以做到的，在四年内提前完成五年计划的农业生产指标也完全是有根据的。洞庭湖滨的南县、华容、安乡、沅江等县县委书记分析增产的有利条件：（一）已有80％的农户入了社，劳动效率可提高30％到50％。（二）湖区水利修的好，过去的水利纠纷也都解决了。（三）肥料已经做了准备。有了这三个条件，就为扩大双季稻打下了基础；扩大双季稻就可以增产，这是多年的经验早已证明了的。醴陵县委原来订的生产计划是每亩田产水稻770斤；后来增加到800斤。在这次会上，县委又分析了具体情况，决定争取每亩田上200担混合肥料，普遍推广良种和采用新技术，基本上消灭虫害，使90％的田能抗旱60天，再把90％的双季稻由间作改为连作。这样，今年就可以达到全县每亩千斤。
    由于农村形势的变化，如何组织、领导大规模的集体生产，充分发挥集体生产的优越性，发挥土地、劳动力的潜在力量，是当前摆在各级党委面前的头等重要的问题。而各级党委在这方面还缺乏具体经验。在新情况下，工作中必然会发生许多新问题；经过反复讨论以后，大家都决心深入群众，调查研究，培养典型，推广先进经验，依靠贫农和下中农的积极性，发挥群众智慧，发现问题，解决问题。
    会上，各地党委都修改和制定了本地以农业增产为主的全面规划。会议决定：今年全省要达到产粮250亿斤以上；1962年达到每亩800斤；1967年达到每亩千斤。全省今年要在醴陵、沅江创造两个千斤县；每个专区要创造一个千斤区；每个县要创造一个千斤乡；每个区要创造一个千斤社；每个社都要创造千斤丰产丘。
