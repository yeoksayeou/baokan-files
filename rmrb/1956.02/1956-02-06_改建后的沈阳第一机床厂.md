    Rebuilt Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant
    Zhang Xiuwen
    The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, rebuilt with Soviet assistance, has officially commenced production.

    Before the reconstruction, the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant could only produce general belt lathes, boxcar lathes, and shapers. With the progress of the reconstruction project, it has begun to produce the latest types of medium and large lathes such as 1A62, 1Д63A, and 1Д65. This year, it will continue to trial produce new products such as 1A64, 9Г153, and deep hole drilling machines. According to its designed capacity, it will also produce multi-tool lathes, six-axis semi-automatic lathes, vertical lathes, and special machine tools for processing automobile crankshafts in the future. Once it fully reaches its designed level, its production capacity will be 6 times higher than the 1952 level before the reconstruction. The machine tools it produces each year can equip five machine manufacturing plants of the same scale.

    The No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is the first successfully rebuilt machine tool manufacturing plant since the beginning of our country's Five-Year Plan, marking a tremendous leap forward in China's machinery industry.

    The factory's production organization was designed by Soviet experts according to the Moscow Red Proletarian Machine Tool Plant. Parts processing and assembly are carried out with a high degree of assembly line operation. The various modern machinery and equipment on the assembly lines were specially manufactured for our country by Soviet workers. With such advanced production organization and modern equipment, the round-trip transportation of work-in-progress parts can be completely avoided, greatly speeding up the production speed.

    In the 1A62 workshop, there are 7 assembly lines, each processing various parts. The processes are closely linked, and after the raw materials enter the workshop, they go through a series of processing steps, and finally are assembled into 1A62 lathes. In this workshop, there is a multi-spindle drill that can drill 40 holes at a time. It only takes 30 minutes to process a headstock box with various distances and multiple holes. In the past, using ordinary drills took at least 30 hours, and the headstock box was often scrapped because the distance between the holes was not accurate.

    To produce precision machine tools, highly precise tools are needed. In the factory's tool workshop, an optical grinder manufactured in the Soviet Union is installed. To ensure the precision of the tools, when workers operate the optical grinder, they can magnify the projection of the workpiece by 50 times on a black glass screen, like showing a movie. The workers then watch this magnified projection to process it. In this workshop, the latest coordinate drills and screw grinders are also installed. The thousands of sets of tool fixtures needed by the entire factory are supplied by this workshop.

    The most difficult thing for the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant in the past was the quenching of parts. When quenching the largest machine tool spindle, workers had to use gas to burn it. To avoid danger, fire trucks were often driven into the workshop. Now high-frequency induction furnaces have been installed, which can heat the parts in a few seconds and quickly cool them down (slow cooling will deform the parts).

    In the past, the factory's casting was entirely manual operation. The workshop was full of smoke, stuffy, and without sunlight. Workers squatted on the ground, using shovels to fill sand into sandboxes, and then used iron rods to compact the sand little by little. After making the sand mold, they had to manually pour the boiling molten iron into the sand mold. After the casting was poured, they had to hammer the casting out of the sand mold one hammer at a time at a high temperature of 200°C. Now, molding, pouring, sand removal, and other production processes are all operated by machines. Workers simply sit or stand next to spacious and clean machines or control consoles, moving levers and pressing buttons.

    The No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has a central metrology room, which specializes in checking the precision of measuring tools. Without highly accurate measuring tools, it is impossible to guarantee the accuracy of the size of the workpiece. Many precision instruments are installed in this central metrology room. Some are checked by light waves, and extremely fine differences such as one five-thousandth of the thickness of a newspaper can be checked. The indoor temperature is regulated by an automated device, completely unaffected by natural climate.

    In the rebuilt No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, working conditions have been significantly improved. In the factory, the transportation of materials and semi-finished products is replaced by mechanized transportation equipment such as conveyor belts, roller belts, cranes, and battery cars instead of manual labor. In addition to ventilation, heating, and dust removal equipment, many workshops also have locker rooms, washrooms, and shower rooms. After going to work, workers can take off their clothes in the locker room and put on work clothes. After get off work, they can take a shower in the shower room and then change their clothes to go home. The green area in the factory is about 10,000 square meters, and a variety of trees have been planted.

    改建后的沈阳第一机床厂
    张修文
    苏联帮助我国改建的沈阳第一机床厂，已经正式投入生产了。
    第一机床厂改建前是个只能生产一般皮带车床、闷罐车床和牛头刨床的工厂。随着改建工程的进行，它已开始生产1 A62、1Д63A、1Д65等最新式的中型、大型车床了。今年它将继续试制1 A64、9Г153以及深孔钻床等新产品。根据设计能力，将来还要生产联动摚床、六轴半自动车床、落地车床以及加工汽车曲轴的特殊机床。全部达到设计水平之后，生产能力将比改建前1952年的水平高6倍。它每年所生产的机床，可以装备5个跟它一般规模的机器制造厂。
    第一机床厂是我国开始五年计划以来第一个改建成功的工作母机制造厂，它标志着我国机械工业的巨大跃进。
    这个工厂的生产组织是苏联专家按照莫斯科红色无产者机床制造厂设计的，零件加工和装配实行高度的流水作业。在流水作业线上的各种现代化机器设备大都是苏联工人特为我国制造的。有了这样的先进生产组织和现代化设备，便可完全避免在制部件的往返运输，大大加快生产速度。
    在1A62车间里，有7条流水作业线，分别加工各种部件。工序和工序之间紧密衔接，荒料进车间后，经过一系列的加工过程，到最后就装配成一台一台的1A62车床了。在这个车间里有一次可以摚40来个眼的联动摚床，它只要30分钟就能把一个有着各种距离的、多眼的床头箱加工出来；过去用普通摚床来摚，最少要30多个小时，而且还时常因为眼和眼之间的距离找不准而把床头箱做废。
    要生产精密机床，就需要非常精密的工具。在这个工厂的工具车间里，安装着一台苏联制造的光学磨床。为了保证工具的精密度，工人操纵光学磨床的时候，可以在乌玻璃屏板上，把工作物的投影放大50倍，像放映电影一样，工人就看着这个放大了的投影来加工。在这个车间里，还安装着最新式的座标摚床、螺丝磨床。全厂需要的数千套工具卡具都靠这个车间供应。
    第一机床厂过去最感困难的是部件淬火。最大的机床主轴淬火的时候，要靠工人用瓦斯烧。为了不出危险，经常把消防车开进车间里来。现在已安设了高周波电炉，几秒钟就能把部件加热好，而且很快就能使它冷却（冷却慢了部件会变形）。
    从前这个工厂的铸造完全是手工操作。车间里烟雾腾腾，闷热而又没有阳光。工人们蹲在地上，用铁锹把砂子填到砂箱里，然后再用铁棍一点一点地把砂子捣实。做好砂型后，还要自己动手把沸腾的铁水灌注到砂型里。铸件浇好以后，他们还要在摄氏200°的高温下，一锤一锤地把铸件从砂型里打落下来。现在，造型、浇铸、落砂等生产过程都使用机器操作。工人只是坐在或站在宽敞而干净的机器或操纵台旁，搬动闸把，揿动电钮就可以了。
    第一机床厂有一个中心计量室，它是专门检查量具的精密程度的。没有高度精确的量具就不可能保证工作物尺码的精确。在这个中心计量室里安着许许多多的精密仪器。有的是靠光波来检查的，像一张报纸厚的五千分之一那样极微细的差度也能检查出来。室内的温度是靠自动化装置调节的，完全不受自然气候的影响。
    在改建后的第一机床厂，劳动条件有显著改善。厂内搬运材料和半成品都有传送带、滚轴带、吊车、电瓶车等机械化运输设备来代替工人的体力劳动。许多车间除设有通风、采暖和吸尘装置外，还有更衣室、洗脸室、淋浴室。工人上班后，可以在更衣室里把自己的衣服脱下来，换上工作服。下班后可以到淋浴室洗个澡，再换衣服回家。厂内的绿化区约有一万多平方公尺，已经栽植了多种多样的树木。
