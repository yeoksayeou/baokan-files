Xinhua News Agency, February 10th—Japanese major newspapers published editorials on February 9th and 10th, supporting the resolutions passed by both houses of the Japanese Diet demanding a ban on atomic and hydrogen bomb testing, and unanimously agreeing that the resolution fully reflects the demands of the Japanese people.

　　"Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that this resolution is more specific and takes a further step than the resolution passed by both houses of the Japanese Diet in the spring of 1954 after the United States tested a hydrogen bomb and killed Japanese fishermen, demanding that the United Nations promptly take steps to ban atomic weapons. It specifically demands that the United States and Britain stop the nuclear weapons tests that are about to be conducted in the Pacific.

　　"Mainichi Shimbun" believes that the storage, use, and manufacturing of atomic and hydrogen bombs must also be prohibited. Both newspapers unanimously demanded that the Diet not merely pass a resolution and be done with it, but should continue to strive to achieve the purpose of implementing this resolution. Both newspapers criticized the Japanese government for adopting a very passive and perfunctory attitude towards this issue.

    日本报纸支持国会要求禁止试验核子武器的决议
    据新华社10日讯　日本各大报在2月9日和10日先后发表社论，支持日本国会两院通过要求禁止试验原子弹和氢弹决议，并且一致认为这个决议完全反映日本国民的要求。
    “朝日新闻”指出，这个决议比起1954年春天由于美国试验氢弹、杀害日本渔民以后，日本国会两院要求联合国从速采取步骤禁止原子武器的决议更具体、更进一步地提出了禁止试验一切核子武器的要求，并且特别要求美国和英国停止即将在太平洋进行的核子武器试验。
    “每日新闻”认为原子弹和氢弹的储存、使用和制造也必须加以禁止。这两家报纸一致要求国会，不要仅仅通过决议就了事，还应该为贯彻这一决议的目的而继续努力。这两家报纸指责日本政府对于这个问题采取非常消极和敷衍了事的态度。
