Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 13th. The "Statesman" reported that on the 10th, when the Pakistani government requested the Constituent Assembly to approve all foreign treaties and agreements Pakistan had participated in, calls of protest against Pakistan's participation in military blocs were raised in the Assembly.

    Opposition member Rehman said: "We have no friends, and because of joining the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, we have offended some major powers. We should not join any national blocs. We should remain neutral."

    Foreign Minister Chaudhri, in his reply, assured the opposition that all conventions and treaties would be submitted to the Assembly for debate, so that the Assembly would have ample opportunity to approve or reject them.

    巴基斯坦反对党议员抗议参加军事集团的政策
    新华社新德里13日电　“政治家报”报道，10日，当巴基斯坦政府要求制宪议会批准巴基斯坦所参与的一切对外条约和协定的时候，议会中发出了抗议巴基斯坦参加军事集团的呼声。
    反对党议员雷赫曼说：“我们没有朋友，而由于参加巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织，我们又触犯了某些大国。我们不应该参加任何国家集团。我们应该保持中立。”
    外交部长乔德里在答辩时对反对党保证说：一切公约和条约都将提交议会辩论，这样议会就有充分机会予以批准或拒绝。
