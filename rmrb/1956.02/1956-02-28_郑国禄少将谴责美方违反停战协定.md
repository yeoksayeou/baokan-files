Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, a meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission was held on February 25th at the request of the Korean-Chinese side.

At the meeting, Major General Zheng Guolu, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, exposed and condemned the various sabotage activities carried out by the U.S. side, both in the past and at present, aimed at abolishing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, based on the established facts and relevant records since the armistice.

Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out that since the armistice, the U.S. side has been violating Article 13 of the Armistice Agreement, illegally transporting large quantities of war materials to continue arming the Syngman Rhee group, and intends to continue doing so in the future. Zheng Guolu said that the U.S. side should submit revised reports on the illegally imported war materials to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; at the same time, it should immediately stop the act of transporting war materials into Korea in violation of the Armistice Agreement; and it should immediately transport all war materials illegally imported into Korea from July 27, 1953, to the present. Zheng Guolu demanded that the U.S. side provide a responsible explanation for this.

At the meeting, Zheng Guolu also raised the fact that the U.S. side forcibly detained a large number of captured personnel from the Korean-Chinese side, and once again demanded that the U.S. side provide a thorough account of the whereabouts of these captured personnel. Major General Zheng Guolu then pointed out that the Korean-Chinese side had conducted a thorough investigation into the list of persons whose whereabouts the U.S. side requested information about on November 26, 1955, and had compared it with the materials at hand on the Korean-Chinese side, proving that the list provided by the U.S. side was crude and poorly made, with many names repeated; many others had already been repatriated to the U.S. side in accordance with the "Agreement on the Exchange of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War" and the provisions of subparagraph of Article 51 of the Armistice Agreement; and some were names of people that the Korean-Chinese side had notified the U.S. side had died, escaped, or been released at the front. Major General Zheng Guolu handed over to the U.S. side a document containing the results of the Korean-Chinese side's investigation into each name on the list provided by the U.S. side.

    郑国禄少将谴责美方违反停战协定
    新华社平壤26日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会2月25日在朝中方面要求下举行了会议。
    朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将在会上根据停战以来已经确立的各种事实和有关的记录，揭露和谴责了美方过去和目前所进行的目的在于废除中立国监察委员会的种种破坏行动。
    郑国禄少将指出，自从停战以来，美方一直在违反停战协定的第13款，非法运入大批作战物资来继续武装李承晚集团，并且打算在以后继续这样做。郑国禄说，美方应该就非法运入的作战物资向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会提出修正报告；同时应该立即停止把作战物资运入朝鲜的这种违反停战协定的行动；并且应该立即把从1953年7月27日到现在这段时期内所非法运入的全部作战物资运出朝鲜。郑国禄要求美方对此作出负责的说明。
    郑国禄在会上还提出美方强迫扣留大量朝中方面被俘人员的事实，再一次要求美方对这些被俘人员的下落作出彻底的交代。郑国禄少将随即指出，朝中方面已经就美方在1955年11月26日向朝中方面提出要求说明下落的名单进行了彻底的调查，并且同朝中方面手头的材料进行了核对，证明美方所提出的名单是粗制滥造的，其中有许多名字是重复的；还有许多人是已经根据“关于交换病伤被俘人员协定”和停战协定第51款子项的规定遣返给美方了的；其中还有一些是朝中方面曾经通知过美方已经死亡、逃走或者在前线被释放的人的名字。郑国禄少将交给美方一份朝中方面对美方所提出的名单上的每一个名字进行调查的结果的材料。
