Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 7th: In the near future, the Soviet Union will have several atomic power stations with a generating capacity of at least 100,000 kilowatts built and put into operation. By the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the total generating capacity of atomic power stations started in the Soviet Union will reach 2 million to 2.5 million kilowatts. This was stated by Corresponding Academician Krzhizhanovsky of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in an article recently published in "Moscow News".

He said that the Soviet Union attaches great importance to atomic power engineering. The Soviet Union has vast areas rich in mineral resources and timber, but these areas are far from fuel sources. Atomic power plants will bring rapid changes to the economy of these remote areas. These power plants use uranium as fuel, and one cubic centimeter of uranium releases energy equivalent to 3 tons of coal. A few tons of uranium can guarantee a power plant to work for a whole year, so even airplanes can be used to transport the necessary amount of uranium to any location in the country.

The world's first atomic power station has been working smoothly since it generated electricity in the Soviet Union in 1954. However, this type of reactor is by no means the only method of atomic power generation. The Soviet Union and other countries are creating more efficient methods, especially using other types of reactors.

Krzhizhanovsky said that the reserves of uranium in the world are very large. It is estimated that the generating capacity of uranium deposits on earth is almost 20 times that of organic fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. It is conceivable that after a few years these organic fuels will only be used for metallurgy, the chemical industry, and personal consumption. As for power engineering, the future belongs to atomic power plants.

    苏联不久将建成几座十万瓩的原子能电力站
    新华社莫斯科7日电　在不久的将来，苏联将有几座发电能力至少是10万瓦的原子能电力站建成并且开始发电。到第六个五年计划结束时，苏联开工的原子能电力站的总发电能力将达到200万瓩到250万瓩。这是苏联科学院通讯院士克鲁日林最近在“莫斯科新闻”上发表的文章中说的。
    他说，苏联对原子动力工程非常重视。苏联有大片地区拥有丰富的矿产资源和木材，但是这些地区离燃料来源很远。原子能电力厂将能给这些边远地区的经济带来迅速的变化。这些电力厂使用铀作燃料，一公分铀所释放的能量等于3吨煤。几吨铀就可以保证一座电力厂工作一整年，因此甚至用飞机也可以把必要数量的铀运到国内任何地点。
    世界上第一个原子能电力站自从1954年在苏联发电以来，一直在顺利地工作。但是，这种类型的反应堆决不是原子能发电的唯一方法。苏联和其他国家正在创造效率更高的方法，特别是使用其他类型的反应堆。
    克鲁日林说，世界上铀的埋藏量是很大的。据估计，地球上蕴藏的铀矿的发电能力，差不多有地球上蕴藏的煤、石油和天然煤气等有机燃料的20倍。可以设想，若干年以后这些有机燃料将只用于冶金、化学工业和个人生活的消耗。至于动力工程，未来是属于原子能电力厂的。
