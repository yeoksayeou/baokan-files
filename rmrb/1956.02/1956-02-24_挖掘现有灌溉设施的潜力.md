    Tap the Potential of Existing Irrigation Facilities
    Dong Qilin
    Currently, the country has water conservancy facilities capable of irrigating approximately 400 million mu of land. If management is further strengthened, these facilities can expand the irrigated area significantly. For example, in the Dandong Irrigation Area in Henan Province, due to the strengthening of irrigation management in recent years, the irrigated area has gradually expanded from 30,000 mu in 1948 to 129,341 mu now, an increase of more than three times. As another example, in the Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi Province, one cubic meter per second of water can irrigate 40,000 mu of land, and in the Yaqiaojiang Irrigation Area in Guangxi Province, 1.2 cubic meters per second of water can irrigate 47,000 mu of paddy fields. However, in many irrigation areas, one cubic meter per second of water can irrigate less than 10,000 mu of land. In the well-irrigated areas of North China, on average, one well and one waterwheel irrigate only about 20 mu; however, in Lixian County, Hebei Province, Du Erzeng's one well and one waterwheel, due to proper management, irrigate more than 100 mu. This all shows that the potential of existing irrigation facilities is significant.
    According to the experience of various regions, improving irrigation techniques and preventing water waste are effective ways to tap irrigation potential. At present, many areas, due to the use of outdated irrigation methods (such as flood irrigation and deep serial irrigation), use excessive and deep watering, which not only wastes water and washes away fertilizer, but also causes a large amount of water leakage, leading to a sharp rise in the groundwater level, resulting in soil salinization and swamping. The result is that the land becomes increasingly barren and yields gradually decline, turning water conservancy into a "water disaster." This should be vigorously improved.
    Practice has proven that changing backward irrigation methods and implementing furrow irrigation and raised bed irrigation can save water, expand the irrigated area, and increase yield per unit area. In Jiuquan Prefecture, Gansu Province, changing serial flood irrigation to small raised bed irrigation has greatly increased yields, and the irrigated area expanded by saving water accounts for 20% of the original area. Cotton furrow irrigation in the Huoquan Canal in Shanxi Province and corn furrow irrigation in the Weihui Canal in Shaanxi Province have both achieved high yields. Well-irrigated areas in our country all use raised bed irrigation or furrow irrigation, and the yields in well-irrigated areas are generally higher and more stable. Last year, key irrigation areas implementing planned water use also increased production. The Luohui Canal in Shaanxi Province increased production by 50 jin per mu, and the Erling Irrigation Area in Jiangsu Province increased production by 20 jin per mu.
    Secondly, improving old canal projects, merging unnecessary channels, increasing water diversion, expanding water sources where conditions permit for old wells with insufficient water sources, and paying attention to repairing leaks in mountain ponds and reservoirs are also effective ways to tap irrigation potential. The Fanglaizhuo Canal system in Hebei Province was chaotic, the engineering was rudimentary, and water leakage was very serious. In the past, more than 20 cubic meters per second of water could only irrigate 79,000 mu of land, but after several years of improving irrigation methods and gradually improving the project, it can now irrigate 229,996 mu of land. The Zamuhe Canal in Gansu Province is also an ancient and rudimentary irrigation project. In the past, there were many and disordered channels, and a lot of water seeped away because the channels passed through gravelly areas. After two years of merging channel entrances, cutting branches and merging trunks, and lining the channels with pebbles, it can now guarantee the irrigation of 300,000 mu of land. The water well of the agricultural production cooperative led by Qiao Zhizhong in Luan County, Shanxi Province, expanded the irrigated area by 25 mu per well after drilling for underground springs. The Yaqiaojiang Irrigation Area in Guangxi Province adopted the method of "long vines bearing melons," drawing water from the canal into the ponds as much as possible when the river water was abundant, and filling all the ponds. Therefore, in the spring drought of 1955, when the river water was only 0.4 cubic meters per second, it also guaranteed the water use of more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields.
    Again, in areas where conditions permit, promoting water storage irrigation and winter irrigation in a way that suits local conditions, at the appropriate time and in appropriate amounts, and making full use of water sources is also an important method of tapping irrigation potential. Using the relatively abundant autumn and winter seasons to carry out water storage irrigation is the valuable experience accumulated by our farmers in their long-term struggle against drought. Drawing water to irrigate fallow land (winter fallow land), combined with agricultural technical measures, can conserve the water poured into the soil, ensuring timely sowing of crops and meeting the water needed for crop development during the seedling stage. It can also reduce the number of irrigations and the irrigation quota during the crop growth period, so that the saved water can be used to expand the irrigated area. In the Hetao area of ​​Inner Mongolia and the various irrigation areas of the Yellow River in Gansu Province, as well as some irrigation areas in Xinjiang, the area of ​​water storage irrigation has reached more than 90%. According to investigations in some areas of Gansu Province, in general drought years, under the same agricultural conditions, the yield in water storage irrigation areas is generally 25-40 jin per mu higher than that in areas without water storage irrigation, and some are 50-100 jin higher. Winter irrigation of winter wheat has a long history in Guanzhong in Shaanxi Province, central Shanxi Province, Henan Province and southwestern Shandong Province, and the well-irrigated areas of the Hebei Plain, and has accumulated a lot of experience. Winter irrigation has a significant effect on increasing wheat production. According to the farmers' field trials and irrigation area trials in the Jinghui Canal, Luohui Canal, Weihui Canal, and Meihui Canal and other 4 irrigation areas in Guanzhong area of ​​Shaanxi Province, the average yield of winter irrigated land was 403.9 jin per mu, while that of non-winter irrigated land was 306 jin.
    In short, strengthening irrigation management can tap huge production potential. At present, most areas of the country have realized semi-socialist agricultural cooperation. This provides extremely favorable conditions for improving engineering facilities, popularizing advanced irrigation technologies, strengthening irrigation management, and expanding the irrigated area. Party and government leading organs and agricultural and water conservancy departments at all levels should strengthen leadership and guidance on irrigation management, tap the potential of existing irrigation facilities, expand the irrigated area, and increase the yield per unit area in irrigated areas.

    挖掘现有灌溉设施的潜力
    董其林
    目前全国有能够灌溉约4亿市亩的水利设施。如果进一步加强管理，这些设施还可以扩大很多灌溉面积。例如河南省丹东灌区几年来由于加强灌溉管理，灌溉面积逐年扩大，由1948年的3万亩发展到现在的129，341亩，增加三倍以上。又如陕西省泾惠渠一秒公方水可以浇到4万亩地，广西省雅桥江灌区1.2秒公方水也能浇到47，000亩稻田；可是有很多灌区一秒公方水却还浇不到1万亩地。华北地区的井灌区，一般的一眼井一架水车平均只浇到20亩左右；可是河北省蠡县杜二增的一井一车，由于管理得当，却浇到100多亩地。这都说明了现有的灌溉设施的潜力是很大的。
    根据各地经验，改进灌溉技术，防止水量浪费，是挖掘灌溉潜力的有效办法之一。目前许多地区由于沿用落后的灌溉方法（如大水漫灌、深浇串灌），浇水过多过深，不仅浪费水量，冲失肥料，并且造成大量水量的渗漏，引起地下水位急遽上升，招致土地盐碱化和沼泽化，结果是土地日益瘠薄，产量逐渐下降，把水利变成了“水害”。这是应该大力改进的。
    实践证明改变落后的灌溉方法，实行沟灌畦灌，就能节约水量，扩大灌溉面积，提高单位面积产量。甘肃省酒泉专区改变串水漫灌为小畦灌，产量大大提高，节约水量所扩大的灌溉面积为原来的20％。山西省霍泉渠推行棉花沟灌，陕西渭惠渠实行玉米沟灌都获得了丰产。我国井灌区都是采用畦灌或沟灌，井灌区的产量一般都较高而又稳定。去年在实行计划用水的重点灌区也都增了产，陕西省洛惠渠每亩增产50斤，江苏省珥陵灌区每亩增产20斤。
    其次，对旧渠工程进行改善，合并那些不必要的渠道，增加引水量，对水源不旺的旧井有条件扩大水源的应该扩大水源，对山塘水库注意维修搪漏等，也是挖掘灌溉潜力的有效办法。河北省房徕涿渠渠系紊乱，工程简陋，跑水漏水现象十分严重，过去引进20多秒公方水，只能浇79，000亩地，但是经过几年来的改进灌溉方法和逐步改善工程，现在已经能浇到229，996亩地。甘肃省杂木河渠也是一个古老的简陋的灌溉工程，过去渠道多而乱，并且渠道经过砂砾地带，水量渗漏很多，经过两年来的合并渠口、裁支并干和用卵石衬砌渠道以后，现在可以保证30万亩土地的灌溉。山西省潞安县乔志忠领导的农业生产合作社的水井，经过锥井下泉以后，一眼井就扩大了25亩灌溉面积。广西省雅桥江灌区采用了“长藤结瓜”的办法，在河水充足的时候，尽量从渠道引水入塘，把所有的塘都蓄满，因此在1955年春旱河水只有0.4秒公方水的时候，也保证了4万多亩稻田的用水。
    再次，在有条件的地区，因地制宜、适时适量地推行储水灌溉及冬灌，充分利用水源，也是挖掘灌溉潜力的重要方法之一。利用水源比较充沛的秋冬季节进行储水灌溉，是我国农民长期同干旱作斗争积累的宝贵经验。引水浇白地（冬闲地），结合农业技术措施，使灌入土壤中的水量保蓄起来，可以保证作物适时播种，满足作物在幼苗期发育所需要的水分，同时也可以减少作物生长期的灌水次数和灌水定额，这样就有可能把节省的水量用来扩大灌溉面积。内蒙古河套地区和甘肃省黄河各灌区以及新疆的一些灌区，进行储水灌溉的面积已经达90％以上。根据甘肃省境内一些地区的调查，在一般干旱年份，在相同的农业条件下，储水灌溉地区的产量比没有实行储水灌溉地区的产量每亩一般高25—40斤，有的高出50—100斤。冬小麦的冬灌在陕西省的关中、山西省的中部、河南省和山东省的西南部以及河北平原的井水灌区，都有很长的历史，并积累了不少的经验。冬灌对小麦的增产有显著的作用，根据陕西关中地区泾惠渠、洛惠渠、渭惠渠、梅惠渠等4个灌区的农民大田试验及灌区试验场的试验，冬灌地平均每亩产小麦403.9斤，不冬灌地则为306斤。
    总之，加强灌溉管理，就可以挖掘出巨大的生产潜力。目前全国大部分地区已经实现半社会主义性质的农业合作化。这就给改善工程设施，推广先进的灌水技术和加强灌溉管理，扩大灌溉面积提供了极为有利的条件。各地党政领导机关和农业水利部门应该加强对灌溉管理的领导和指导工作，挖掘现有灌溉设施的潜力，扩大灌溉面积，提高灌溉地区的单位面积产量。
