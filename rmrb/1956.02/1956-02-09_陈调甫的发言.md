Comrade Chairman, esteemed committee members, comrades:

I have listened to Premier Zhou's report and the reports of the other leading comrades. I completely agree and wholeheartedly support them.

In the recent short period, our motherland has seen new atmospheres and new outlooks. All capitalist industrialists and businessmen in the cities have accepted socialist transformation, with gongs and drums resounding and good news pouring in. Workers and capitalists shake hands in joyful celebration, as close as brothers. Such a complete liberation of productive forces has greatly advanced our motherland's socialist industrialization. In the countryside, people are also abandoning the small-scale individual economy one after another, joining cooperatives. Those who have already established elementary cooperatives wish to transform into advanced cooperatives. The high tide of agricultural cooperation has also reached its peak.

These two high tides are unprecedented grand events in the history of our country, milestones on our path towards socialism, marking that our motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise and great leader Chairman Mao, is advancing towards the road of prosperity and happiness with unparalleled speed.

I am a technician. Born in such a glorious era, after reading Premier Zhou’s report on the question of intellectuals, which takes care of all aspects of intellectuals, such as their use, arrangement, and living standards, meticulously and comprehensively, I am filled with gratitude and excitement. I have decided to do the following things well:

(1) I am the technical director of Tianjin Yongming Paint Industry Company. At present, various construction projects need high-grade paints, and it is urgent to improve quality to meet the pressing requirements. I am willing to do my best. On the one hand, I will conduct more research myself and run the laboratory of our factory well. On the other hand, I will absorb more advanced Soviet experience, consult more with Soviet experts, and learn more from Chinese experts in various universities and scientific research institutes, combining practice with theory to solve the important basic technical problems existing in China's paint industry. Because manufacturing paint is an important industry, its products have thousands upon thousands of uses, from airplanes, tanks, trains, and ships to buttons, toys, hats, and leather shoes, all of which need paint. It can have a significant impact on national defense, industrial construction, and people's daily lives. Therefore, during this period of great construction, the products of paint factories must be raised to the level required by all aspects in a short period.

(2) Our company became a joint state-private enterprise in 1953, and it has been three years since then. Production has increased sixfold, and the number of employees has increased from 150 to 420. There has also been significant progress in other areas. In just three short years, the development of the enterprise has exceeded the records of the previous 25 years, which is truly a miracle. All of this should be attributed to the enthusiasm and selfless labor of the employee comrades, and even more so to the correct leadership of the Party, the government, and the public share representatives. In the future, I have decided to further accept the leadership of the public share representatives, accept the leadership of the working class, and make closer connections. When encountering technical problems, I will fully, repeatedly, and tirelessly explain them, and prove them with facts, stepping up my connection work.

(3) The paint industry is a highly technical and comprehensive industry. In the past twenty or thirty years, it has made rapid progress, like other industries, and its achievements are amazing. Although China's paint industry has a history of more than 40 years, our technology is still far from world standards, and we must catch up quickly. Shanghai has the most paint factories, many technical talents, and its products are also very good. I very much hope that all parties will join hands, exchange experiences, and learn from each other. I myself am willing to follow the lead of my colleagues across the country and contribute all my strength to a grand gathering of paint technology troops from all aspects in the near future. If everyone works together, I believe that within twelve years, China's paint technology can reach the level of advanced countries, and I also believe that it can surpass the world's level, because China has a national treasure that European and American countries do not have—the natural lacquer secreted from the lacquer tree.

(4) Translation work is one of the important tasks that technicians should do. I have decided to review and consolidate the Soviet language that I learned 20 years ago but have now mostly forgotten, translate more Soviet books and newspapers, and promote scientific knowledge, fully providing the knowledge food needed by the technical army. I heard someone say that manuscripts translated by 50-year-olds will not be satisfactory. Although I am nearly 70 years old, I still want to do my best and compete with the young ones.

(5) During this period of great construction, the country lacks technical cadres the most. Our company has a technical training class, and in the future, we will expand and improve it to cultivate more cadres for the country.

(6) Strive to create new varieties, search for substitutes, save raw materials, reduce costs, improve quality, accumulate funds for the country, indirectly support heavy industry, and strive to overfulfill and complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule.

(7) Strive to promote the many scientific organizations in Tianjin, especially the Tianjin branch of the Chinese Chemical Engineering Society, for which I am directly responsible. Because I believe that uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals through scientific organizations is the most appropriate way. I believe that the technical personnel in major cities sitting here also feel the same way as I do and are willing to accelerate the activities of academic organizations so that they become as active as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

(8) The last item, and also the most important item, is that I have decided to strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to arm my mind and combine politics with technology. At the same time, I will heighten my vigilance, sharpen my eyes, and join the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Because hidden bad people are everywhere, and small and medium-sized factories and mines are also good places for them to hide.

Finally, I have a small suggestion. There are many female comrades in China's scientific and technical circles, and I hope that they will be given special care. Many jobs are particularly meticulous and precise when done by female comrades (such as analytical chemistry), and many jobs are not suitable for female comrades to do for a long time (such as mine surveying). If appropriate adjustments can be made, their contributions will be even greater. They are the stars of the scientific community. Not only can they radiate light themselves, but they can also cultivate the next generation of young scientists for the motherland!

    陈调甫的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听了周总理和各位首长的报告，我完全同意，并衷心地拥护。
    在最近的短时期内，我们的祖国，出现了新气象和新面貌，城市中全部资本主义工商业者接受了社会主义的改造，锣鼓喧天，喜报不绝。职工与资本家握手联欢，亲如兄弟。这样的全部生产力的解放，对于祖国的社会主义工业化，大大推进了一步。农村中亦纷纷放弃了小农个体经济，加入合作社，已办低级社的愿变为高级社，农业合作化的高潮，也到了最高峰。
    这两个高潮，是我国历史上无前例的盛举，是我国走向社会主义道路的里程碑、标志着我们的祖国在中国共产党和英明伟大的领袖毛主席领导之下，正以无比的速度，向富强康乐的道路迈进。
    我是一个技术人员，生在这样的光荣时代，读了周总理关于知识分子问题的报告，对于知识分子使用安排生活待遇等面面顾到，无微不至。感激兴奋之余，决定做好以下几件事：
    （1）我是天津永明油漆工业公司的技术负责人，现在各种建设方面，需要高级油漆，急需提高质量，以应迫切的要求。我愿意尽我全力，一方面自己多作研究，办好本厂的化验室，一方面多吸收苏联先进经验，多向苏联专家请教，多向各高等学校各科学研究所中国专家学习，把实际与理论相结合，以解决我国油漆业所存在的重要的基本技术问题。因为制造油漆是重要工业之一种，它的产品，有千千万万的用途，大至飞机、坦克、火车、轮船，小至钮扣、玩具、帽子、皮鞋，无不需要油漆。它对于国防、对于工业建设、对于民生日常生活，均能发生重大的作用。所以在此大建设时期，必须把油漆厂的产品，在短期内提高到各方面所要求的水平。
    （2）我公司于1953年公私合营，至今已三年，产量增加了六倍，职工由150人增至420人，其他各方面，也有巨大的进步。在短短的三年中，事业的发展超过了以往25年的纪录，真是一个奇迹。凡此种种，应归功于职工同志的积极性和忘我劳动，更应归功于党和政府及公股代表的正确领导。今后我决定更进一步接受公股代表的领导，接受工人阶级的领导，作更密切的联系。遇到技术问题，必充分地反复地不厌不倦地加以说明，并以事实证明，加紧一步，做好联系工作。
    （3）油漆工业，是高度技术化的综合性工业，二三十年，同别种工业一样，突飞猛进，成绩惊人。我国油漆工业虽有40多年的历史，但我们的技术离世界标准尚远，必须急起直追，迎头赶上。油漆工厂上海最多，技术人材很多，出品也很好，我很希望各方面携起手来，交流经验，互相学习。我本人愿意追随全国各同业之后，贡献一切力量，不久来一个各方面油漆技术军队的大会师。如果大家一同努力，我相信不到十二年，我国的油漆技术可以达到先进各国的水平，我亦相信，可以超过世界的水平，因为我国有欧美各国所没有的国宝——就是漆树上分泌出来的天然漆。
    （4）翻译工作，是技术人员应做的重要工作之一。我决定把我20年前学过而现在大半忘记的苏联文字，温习起来，巩固起来，多译苏联书报，推广科学知识，充分供给技术大军所需的知识食粮。听见有人说，50岁的人译的稿件，不会令人满意的，我虽年近70，还要勉为其难，同老头儿争气。
    （5）在此大建设时期，国家最缺乏的是技术干部。我公司设有技术训练班，今后还要扩充改良，多多为国家培养干部。
    （6）努力创造新品种，搜寻代用品，节约原材料，降低成本，提高质量，为国家积累资金，间接支援重工业，为超额完成并提前完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。
    （7）努力推动天津市的许多科学团体，尤其是我直接负责的中国化学工程学会天津市分会。因为我相信通过科学团体，去团结教育改造知识分子，是最适当的办法。我相信各大城市在座的技术人员，亦与我有同感，愿意加速推动学术团体的活动，使它们同工商联一样地活跃起来。
    （8）最后的一项，亦是最重要一项。我决定努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，以武装自己的头脑，把政治与技术结合起来。同时提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，投入肃清反革命分子运动中去。因为暗藏的坏人，到处皆有，中小型的厂矿亦是他们藏身的好地方。
    最后我有一个小小建议，我国科学界技术界有不少的女同志，希望加以特别的照顾。有许多工作，女同志做起来，特别细致精密（例如分析化学），有许多工作，女同志不宜长期做的（例如矿山测量），如能加以适当的调整，她们的贡献将更大些。她们是科学界的明星、非但本身能放射出光芒来，还能为祖国培养下一代的小科学家呢！
