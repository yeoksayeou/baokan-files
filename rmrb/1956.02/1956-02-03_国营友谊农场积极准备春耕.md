State-owned Friendship Farm is actively preparing for spring plowing. In gale-force winds, blizzards, and temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius, workers are persevering in overhauling agricultural machinery and cleaning seeds. As of January 15, all of the farm's tractors, except for the 5 that are undergoing maintenance, have been serviced; more than 2,000 pieces of agricultural machinery have also been basically overhauled. In terms of seeds, other grain seeds have been fully prepared except for corn and potato seeds.

This year is the first year of large-scale production for the State-owned Friendship Farm after land reclamation. The farm's planting area will reach 375,000 mu, and the entire farm plans to produce 37,000 tons of grain, handing over 1.5 million to 2 million yuan in profits to the state.

    国营友谊农场积极准备春耕
    国营友谊农场正在积极进行春耕生产的准备工作。在狂风暴雪和零下30度的日子里，职工们坚持检修农业机具和清选种子。到1月15日止，全场的拖拉机除5台正在保养外，其余的94台都已经保养好了；2，000多件农业机具也已经基本上检修完毕。在种子方面，除玉米、马铃薯种外，其他谷物种子都已经准备齐全。
    今年是国营友谊农场开荒后进行大规模生产的第一年。农场的播种面积将达375，000亩，全场计划产粮37，000吨，向国家上缴利润150万到200万元。
