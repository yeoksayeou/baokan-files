    Oil Exploration Teams Active in the Jiuquan Basin
    By Our Correspondent Kang Weizhong

    The beautiful and fertile Jiuquan Basin in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province holds abundant reserves of natural petroleum.

    To develop these petroleum resources, the Yumen Mining Bureau's Geological Survey Office has organized 30 exploration teams, comprising over 1,000 petroleum industry pioneers, including specialists in geology, seismology, gravity and magnetics, surveying, shallow drilling, surface electrical prospecting, hydrogeology, hydrogeological drilling, and rock property research. They are conducting geological reconnaissance, detailed surveys, and precise measurements across a vast area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers centered on the Jiuquan Basin.

    In April of last year, this exploration force braved the biting winds of the frontier, crossed snow-capped mountains and icy rivers, and arrived at their work sites. In a short span of eight months, they completed over 70,000 square kilometers of surface surveys, over 2,000 square kilometers of topographic surveying, over 1,000 kilometers of seismic profiles, over 10,000 kilometers of gravity and magnetic survey route profiles, surface electrical prospecting at over 400 points, specialized rock physics research involving over 4,000 numbered specimens, and 10,000 meters of shallow geological drilling. By the end of November, they had exceeded their annual plan by 33.8%. The achievements of 1955 surpassed those of any previous year. In the western part of the Jiuquan Basin and near the Yumen Oilfield, they discovered uplifted subsurface petroleum structures. Comprehensive research in coordination with the Chinese Academy of Sciences has proven that the extensive areas of Baiyang River, Dahongquan, and Qingcaowan are zones where oil-bearing strata are distributed. Through detailed surveys, a thorough understanding of the geological extent and structure of the area east of the Jiuquan Basin was gained, and structures with potential for oil storage were discovered. A thorough understanding of the geological structure and lithofacies of the Heli Mountain area was also achieved. The exploration team also found abundant mineral resources such as copper, lead, zinc, magnetite, hematite, and coal in the Mazongshan area, providing clues for further exploration by relevant departments.

    During the work, Soviet experts helped them establish teams for geophysical exploration such as surface electrical prospecting, hydrogeological teams, and hydrogeological drilling teams, cultivating the independent working ability of geological exploration personnel and improving their technical level. In geological work, they have learned the drawing and study of geological structure maps, and can analyze the formation history of various geological structures based on the completed structure maps. The hydrogeological and hydrogeological drilling teams found good water sources in places like Petroleum Gully, solving the water needs for industrial construction. The gravity and magnetic team widely adopted the working method of "general survey first, then detailed survey" last year, greatly improving the quality of geological investigation. The successful application of the "comparative refraction method" by the seismic team has also created favorable conditions for finding subsurface structures in the future in the geologically complex Jiuquan Basin.

    In the Jiuquan Basin, seasonal climate changes are unpredictable. In July, the daytime temperature on the Gobi Desert can reach 40 degrees Celsius, while at night it can drop below zero. The exploration team members endured the extreme heat at noon to persist in their work. During the hot season, water is indispensable at all times. However, water is very scarce here. When the 303rd Gravity and Magnetic Team went to Mazongshan to work, they loaded eight large barrels of water onto their trucks. From the day of departure, everyone stopped washing their faces and brushing their teeth, and water consumption was strictly rationed every day. Once, the team crossed a steep mountain, and the heavy trucks had difficulty climbing. Everyone poured the water from the large barrels into smaller buckets and carried them bucket by bucket from the bottom of the mountain to the top. Mobile homes and tents were often blown down by winds of force seven or eight. At such times, they would quickly cover the instruments and drawing boards with cotton-padded coats and oilcloth to prevent damage. These difficulties imposed by nature did not dampen the exploration team members' enthusiasm for work. The members of the 102nd Reconnaissance Team traveled 800 kilometers during their reconnaissance from Anxi in Gansu to Hami in Xinjiang, working in high mountains, sand dunes, and the vast Gobi Desert for more than four months. One day, in the mountains north of Xingxing Gorge, technician Zhang Fushun and intern Jie Yongchang accidentally came across a place where Cretaceous strata were exposed. They were very happy and, to measure its thickness and lithological changes, worked tirelessly until the sun went down. The main team had moved far away, and the moving camels had taken all the supplies. That night, they had to spend the night in the wilderness, enduring hunger, thirst, and the biting cold. The next day, people sent by the team headquarters found them. In order to complete the profile map of the Qilian Mountains, the 301st Gravity and Magnetic Team crossed the steep Qilian Mountains to Ebo in Qinghai in two vehicles. Snow melted on the mountains, and snowmelt flowed down along the mountain gullies. The mountains were high and the roads were slippery, and the vehicles could not move. The team members all worked together, pulling from the front and pushing from the back, using stones to pad the wheels, helping the vehicles climb the layers of high mountains. When they reached the top of the mountain, the tripod of the gravity and magnetic instruments could not be placed level, so they used hoes to level the ground, ensuring the accuracy of the instruments and completing the task on schedule.

    The lives of the exploration team members are rich and colorful. Wherever they go, there are loud songs. Every Saturday, they would light a bonfire, and everyone would dance and sing around it. If there was no fresh meat to eat, they would hunt wild animals to stew. If there were no green vegetables, they would pick sand onions in the desert.

    The geological exploration workers have received strong support from all over the country. Workers in machinery factories in Northeast China, Shanghai, and other places have manufactured four-cylinder diesel engines and generators for them; excellent exploration teams sent by the Ministry of Geology have assisted them in reconnaissance; senior scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have enthusiastically guided their research work. Wherever they go, they receive warm receptions from people of all ethnic groups, who provide their own grain and vegetables for the team members to eat, and use their own horses, donkeys, and camels to help transport instruments and equipment, and personally lead the way to find water sources. Thousands of letters sent by people from all over the country also inspire them.

    In the course of practical work, the team members have all grown up. Most of the new university and junior college students who came last year have mastered general field work methods, can draw columnar profile maps, survey and draw cross-sectional maps, and some can skillfully draw lithofacies paleogeographic maps. The original technicians, after short-term training, can generally master the description of geological points, measuring and drawing columnar profile maps, and determining the changes in rock physical properties. In 1955, 98 people were promoted from interns to technicians, and 118 apprentices became technicians. Zhi Linde, who came from a peasant background, mastered not only the operation of instruments in less than a year as an apprentice, but also led a group to work independently, creating a new record for measuring points in complex conglomerate areas and becoming an excellent technician.

    活跃在酒泉盆地的石油勘探队
    本报记者  康伟中
    在美丽、富饶的甘肃河西走廊酒泉盆地，蕴藏着丰富的天然石油。
    为着开发这些石油资源，玉门矿务局地质调查处组织了包括地质、地震、重磁力、测量、浅钻、地面电测、水文地质、水文钻井和岩石物性研究的30个勘探队，共有1，000多名石油工业尖兵，正在以酒泉盆地为中心的周围约30万平方公里的辽阔土地上，展开了地质普查、详查和细测工作。
    去年4月，这支勘探队伍迎着塞外刺骨的寒风，越过雪山和冰河，来到了工作现场。在短短的8个月中，他们完成了7万多平方公里的地面调查，2，000多平方公里的地形测量，1，000多公里长的地震剖面，1万多公里长的重磁力测量路线剖面，400多个点的地面电测，4，000多块标号的岩石物理专题研究，1万公尺的地质浅钻。截至11月底，他们已经超额完成了全年计划33.8％。1955年的成绩比已往任何一年都大。在酒泉盆地西部和玉门油矿附近，发现隆起的石油潜伏构造。经过和中国科学院配合的综合研究结果证明，在白杨河、大红圈和青草湾的广大地区内，是储油层分布地区。经过详查，对酒泉盆地以东地区的地质范围和结构有了充分了解，并发现有储油可能的构造，对合黎山地区的地质构造和岩相也有了充分的认识。勘探队还在马鬃山一带找到了铜、铅、锌、磁铁、赤铁和煤等丰富的矿产资料，给有关部门作进一步勘探提供了线索。
    在工作中，苏联专家帮助他们建立了地面电测等地球物理勘探队、水文地质队和水文钻井队等队伍，培养了地质勘探人员的独立工作能力，提高了他们的技术水平。在地质工作方面，他们已学会地质构造图的绘制和研究，可以根据完成的构造图来分析各地质构造的形成历史。水文地质队和水文钻井队，在石油沟等地方找到了良好的水源，解决了工业建设的用水问题。重磁力队去年普遍采用了“先普查，后详查”的工作方法，大大提高了地质调查的质量。地震队采用“对比折射法”成功后，也给今后在地质构造复杂的酒泉盆地找寻潜伏构造创造了有利条件。
    在酒泉盆地，四季气候变化无常。七月间，在戈壁滩上，白天要热到摄氏40度，晚间则冷到零度以下。勘探队员们忍受着中午的奇热坚持工作。在酷热的季节里，水是每时每刻都不可缺少的。但是，这里水很缺乏。当三零三重磁力队去马鬃山工作的时候，在大卡车上装载了8大桶水。从出发那天起，大家都不洗脸，不刷牙，每天喝水也实行定量供应。有一次，队伍翻过一个陡峭的山头，载重汽车上山有困难，大家就把大桶里的水倒到小桶内，从山下一桶一桶地背上山去。行军房和帐篷经常被七级、八级风吹倒。在这种时候，他们就急忙用棉袄和油布盖好仪器和图板，免受损伤。这些大自然所给予的困难并不能挫折勘探队员们的工作积极性。一零二普查队的队员们在由甘肃的安西到新疆的哈密一带进行普查的时候，整整走了800公里，在高山、沙丘和大戈壁滩里整整工作了四个多月。有一天，在猩猩峡以北的群山中，技术员张福顺和实习生借永昌偶然走到一个露出白垩纪地层的地方。他俩非常高兴，为了测量它的厚度和岩性变化，不知疲倦地一直工作到太阳下山。大队走远了，搬家的骆驼也把东西全部带走了。这一夜他俩就只好露宿在山野里，忍受着饥渴和刺骨的寒冷。第二天，队部派来的人才找到了他们。三○一重磁力队为了完成祁连山的剖面图，乘两辆汽车越过陡峻的祁连山到青海的俄博去。山上积雪融化，雪水沿着山沟奔流而下。山高路滑，汽车走不动，队员们就一齐动手，前边拉后边推，用石头垫车轮，帮助汽车爬上了层层高山。到了山上，重磁力仪器的三角架放不平，他们就用镢头刨平地面，保证了仪表的准确性，如期完成了任务。
    勘探队员们的生活是丰富多采的。他们到哪里，哪里便洋溢着嘹亮的歌声。每到星期六，就烧起一堆野火，大家围着跳舞唱歌。没有鲜肉吃，就打野兽来炖。没有青菜，就动手拔沙漠上的沙葱。
    地质勘探工作人员得到了全国各地的大力支援。东北、上海等地机械厂的工人们为他们制造了四缸柴油机、发电机；地质部派来的优秀的勘探队，协助他们普查；科学院年长的科学家热心地指导他们进行研究工作。每到一地，更得到各族人民热情的接待，他们把自己的粮食、蔬菜拿来供队员食用，用自己的马、驴、骆驼来帮助载运仪器设备，并亲自带路，寻找水源。全国各地人民寄来的成千上万封的书信，也鼓舞着他们。
    在实际工作的锻炼中，队员们都成长起来了。去年新来的大学生和专科学生，大部分都掌握了野外一般的工作方法，能够绘制柱状的剖面图，测绘横剖面图，有的还能够熟练地绘制岩相古地理图。原有的技工经过短期的培养，一般都能掌握地质点的描述，丈量和绘制柱状剖面图，测定岩石物理性质的变化等工作。1955年，由实习员升为技术员的就有98人，学徒，为技工的就有118人。农民出身的职麟德当学徒不到一年，不但掌握了仪器操作，还能领导一个组单独工作，在复杂的砾岩地区，创造了测点新纪录，成为一个优良的技工。（附图片）
