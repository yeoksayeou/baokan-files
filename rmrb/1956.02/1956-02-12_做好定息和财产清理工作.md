The State Council's "Provisions on Implementing Fixed Interest Rates in Joint State-Private Enterprises" and "Provisions on Several Major Issues Concerning Asset Inventory and Valuation When Private Enterprises Implement Joint State-Private Ownership" are significant measures for the state to further strengthen socialist transformation.

The implementation of fixed interest rates, although it still means that a portion of the value created by workers is distributed to capitalists, is a big step forward compared to the "four-horse division" method. Because with fixed interest, capitalists are guaranteed to obtain profits from the enterprise, but not without restrictions. The greatest significance of fixed interest lies in its ability to promote the production and operation of enterprises in accordance with socialist principles. This will not only greatly increase the production enthusiasm of workers, but also create favorable conditions for the future transformation of joint state-private enterprises into enterprises under ownership by the whole people. After the implementation of fixed interest rates, private shareholders of joint state-private enterprises can receive stable dividends quarterly regardless of the enterprise's profit or loss, which is also a great convenience and consideration for investors. Private industrialists and businessmen should correctly understand the intention of this policy, more actively accept socialist transformation, and strive to ultimately transform themselves into self-reliant laborers.

The fixed interest rate range of 1 to 6 percent set nationwide is suitable for the specific conditions of private industry and commerce in China. The original profit and loss situations of private industry and commerce in China were different. A minimum of 1 percent is set for fixed interest in order to take care of industrial and commercial households that had profits below 1 percent or even losses in the past; a maximum of 6 percent is set in order to take care of high-profit industrial and commercial households that play a greater role in the national economy and people's livelihood or have special skills and contributions. In order to take care of the specific situations of various regions, industries, and enterprises, it is stipulated that the interest rates between various regions and industries can be the same or different; the same industry within the same region can stipulate the same interest rate, but it can also stipulate several different interest rates. The above-mentioned regulations are relatively flexible. By earnestly implementing these regulations, we will be able to do a good job of setting interest rates in a practical and realistic manner, and appropriately balance the interest rates between various regions and industries.

For overseas Chinese who remit money back to China to invest in investment companies run by the state after liberation, the interest on their investments is stipulated in principle to be different from that of domestic private industry and commerce. The investment of overseas Chinese in investment companies operated by the state should still be paid dividends in accordance with the regulations of 8 percent annual interest, without any changes.

The work of setting interest rates is a rather detailed task. We must conduct investigations and research and consult with the private sector. If the private sector of some joint state-private enterprises still has concerns or cannot immediately implement the fixed interest rate method for other reasons, they can temporarily not fix the interest rate and continue to distribute the enterprise's profits according to the principle of "four-horse division." Many enterprises that implemented joint state-private ownership during the high tide of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce are relatively small in scale. If these enterprises still adopt the method of distribution and sales on commission, then fixed interest should not be implemented, and the enterprise's profits can be distributed according to past practice. In the process of public-private consultation, activists in the industrial and commercial sectors should earnestly study the situation of their own industry and enterprise, put forward opinions, and assist the government in doing a good job in this work. The various trade associations should also play an active role in this work.

The inventory and valuation of enterprise property is an important link in the implementation of joint state-private ownership by private enterprises. The property relations of the numerous large, medium, and small enterprises in our country are very complicated. When dealing with these complicated property relations, uniform regulations must be made on the main issues of the means of production and property of private enterprises, and the remaining issues should be handled fairly, reasonably, and realistically according to the different situations in various regions and in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's handling of the main issues.

In order to enable bourgeois elements to accept transformation with peace of mind and actively do a good job in production management after the enterprise has implemented joint state-private ownership, the state has adopted the policy of "lenient treatment" and "settling as much as possible" in the property handling of private enterprises when implementing joint state-private ownership. The so-called "lenient" means that for issues related to public-private relations in property inventory and valuation, such as the valuation of machinery, equipment, houses, and land, the handling of private enterprise public welfare funds, the handling of living materials for enterprises that do not distinguish between the family and the store (factory), and the property valuation of small enterprises that may be merged or relocated, lenient treatment should be given whenever possible. The so-called "settling" means that all kinds of debts and property relations of the enterprise, including the enterprise's original debts, stagnant materials, and other property relations, etc., should be settled as much as possible when implementing joint state-private ownership. This practice not only conforms to the wishes of capitalists and other industrialists and businessmen at present, but also conforms to the interests of the broad masses of the people throughout the country. Therefore, party and government leading organs in various places must deeply explain the spirit of this policy of the party and the state to cadres and workers so that they can grasp this spirit in the work of property inventory and valuation.

### 做好定息和财产清理工作

    做好定息和财产清理工作
    国务院“关于在公私合营企业中推行定息办法的规定”和“关于私营企业实行公私合营的时候对财产清理估价几项主要问题的规定”是国家进一步加强社会主义改造的一项重大措施。
    实行定息办法，虽然还意味着要从工人所创造出来的价值中分一部分给资本家，但是，这比起“四马分肥”的办法又前进了一大步。因为定了息，资本家取得企业的利润既有了保证，又不至于没有限制。而定息的最大意义，还在于它可以促进企业按照社会主义的原则进行生产经营。这不仅会使工人的生产积极性大大提高，也为将来公私合营企业改变为全民所有制的企业创造了有利的条件。实行定息办法以后，公私合营企业的私股股东不论企业盈亏都能够按季得到稳定的股息，这也是对投资人很大的方便和照顾。私营工商业者应当正确地体会这种政策的用意，更加积极地接受社会主义改造，努力使自己最后改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    定息办法规定全国息率的幅度为1厘至6厘，这是适合我国私营工商业的具体情况的。我国私营工商业原来的盈亏情况不一样，定息起码1厘，为的是照顾过去获利在1厘以下的甚至经营有亏损的工商户；最高为6厘，为的是照顾对国计民生作用较大或有特殊技艺和贡献的利润高的工商户。为了照顾各地区、各行业、各企业的具体情况，规定各地区、各行业之间的息率可以相同，也可以不同；同一地区的行业内部可以规定同一的息率，但也可以规定几个不同的息率。上述的规定都是比较灵活的。认真地执行这些规定，我们就能够实事求是地作好定息工作，并且使各地区各行业间的息率适当平衡。
    对于在解放以后汇款回国投资于国家经营的投资公司的华侨，规定他们投资的利息原则上不同于国内私营工商业。华侨原来在国家经营的投资公司中的投资，仍然应当按照年息8厘的规定发给股息，不作变更。
    定息工作是一项相当细致的工作，我们必须进行调查研究，必须同私方进行协商。某些公私合营企业的私方如果还有顾虑或者由于其他原因不能立即实行定息的办法，也可以暂不定息，仍然按照“四马分肥”的原则分配企业利润。在私营工商业的社会主义改造的高潮中实行公私合营的企业，有不少是规模较小的，对于这种企业，如果仍然采用经销代销的办法，那就不应实行定息，可以按照过去的惯例分配企业的利润。在公私协商过程中，工商界的积极分子应当认真研究本行业、本企业的情况，提出意见，协助政府做好这项工作。各同业公会在这项工作中也要发挥积极作用。
    对企业财产的清理估价，是私营企业实行公私合营的一个重要环节。我国为数众多的大、中、小企业，它们的财产关系是十分复杂的，处理这些复杂的财产关系的时候，对私营企业的生产资料和财产方面的主要问题必须作统一的规定，对其余的问题应该根据各个地区不同的情况，按照国务院处理主要问题的精神公平合理、实事求是地加以处理。
    为了使资产阶级分子在企业已经实行公私合营以后，能够安心地接受改造和积极地做好生产管理工作，国家对私营企业实行公私合营时的财产处理，采取了“从宽处理”和“尽量了结”的方针。所谓“宽”，就是对财产清理估价有关公私关系方面的问题，如关于机器、设备、房屋、土地的估价和对私营企业公积金的处理，如对于家店（厂）不分的企业的生活资料的处理，和对于可能被合并或被迁移的小企业的财产估价等问题的处理，凡是可以从宽的就都从宽处理。所谓“了”，就是对企业原来的各种债务和财产关系，包括企业原有的债务、呆滞物资和其他财产关系等等，能够在公私合营的时候了结的，都尽量了结。这种做法不但符合目前资本家和其他工商业者的愿望，同时也符合于全国广大人民的利益。因此，各地党政领导机关必须在干部和工人群众中，深入解释党和国家的这个政策的精神，使他们在清产估价的工作中，能够掌握这种精神。
