    The Old Man Who Cultivates Forests for the Motherland
    To the Editor:
    In Dongye Village, Lin County, Henan Province, lives an old man who wholeheartedly cultivates forests for the motherland. This old man is Shi Yudian, a Communist Party member and tree-planting expert who attended the National Model Worker Representatives Conference of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers in 1950.
    Shi Yudian is 62 years old this year. To green the land of the motherland, he still works tirelessly like a young man. Shi Yudian has cultivated more than three million saplings in the more than four mu of nurseries he has opened on his own land and on barren mountains. These saplings are distributed to various villages for afforestation free of charge. He has also put a lot of hard work into grafting fruit trees. The mountains and fields near Dongye Village are full of persimmon trees, peach trees, and apricot trees, of which more than 30,000 were grafted by Shi Yudian. In the past two years, he has also carried out many meaningful experiments, grafting Yantai pear branches onto mulberry trees, grapevines onto persimmon trees, and peach branches onto willow trees... In a few years, many fruit trees will bear new fruits under his cultivation.
    Shi Yudian also paid attention to leveraging the power of the masses in his tree planting and afforestation work. Dongye Village has more than 5,000 mu of bare barren hills. When Shi Yudian began to propose planting trees on the barren hills, most of the villagers had no confidence. Some people said, "We are already too busy with the work in the fields, why waste effort planting trees on rocks!" With the support of the Party organization, Shi Yudian went everywhere to publicize the benefits and methods of tree planting and afforestation to the masses. After the masses accepted his advocacy, a surge of enthusiasm for tree planting and afforestation appeared locally. Now, 4,000 mu of barren hills in Dongye Village are covered with vigorous locust trees, oak trees, and various fruit trees. A 13-li-long belt of trees has also appeared on both sides of the small river leading from Rencun District to Dongye Village.

### 为祖国培育森林的老人

    为祖国培育森林的老人
    编辑同志：
    在河南省林县东冶村，住着一位一心一意为祖国培育森林的老人。这位老人就是曾经出席1950年全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的植树能手——共产党员石玉殿。
    石玉殿今年62岁了，为了绿化祖国的大地，他仍像年青人一样不知疲倦地工作着。石玉殿在自己的土地上和在荒山上开辟的四亩多地的苗圃，几年来培育出三百多万株树苗，这些树苗都无代价地分送给各村造林。他对嫁接果树的工作也付出了很多辛勤的劳动。在东冶村附近满山遍野是柿树、桃树和杏树，其中有三万多株是石玉殿接活的。近二年来，他又进行了许多有意义的试验，在桑树上嫁接烟台梨树的枝梢，在柿树上嫁接葡萄藤，在柳树上嫁接桃枝……；几年以后，许多果树在他的培育下，将会结出新的果实来。
    石玉殿在植树造林的工作中还注意了发挥群众的力量。东冶村有五千多亩光秃秃的荒山。当石玉殿开始提出要在荒山上造林的意见的时候，村里大部分人都没有信心。有人说：“地里活还忙不过来，还到石头板上栽树去白费工！”石玉殿在党组织的支持下，就到处向群众宣传植树造林的好处和办法。在群众接受他的宣传以后，当地就出现了植树造林的热潮。现在，东冶村已经有四千亩荒山上长满了茁壮的洋槐、橡树和各种果树。从任村区通向东冶村去的小河两岸，也出现了一行长达13里的林带。
