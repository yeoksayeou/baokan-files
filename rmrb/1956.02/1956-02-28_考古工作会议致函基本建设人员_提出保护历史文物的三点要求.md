The archaeological work conference, which closed on the 27th, wrote a letter to the youth shock brigades in basic construction, presenting them with three requirements for protecting historical relics:

    First, all ancient relics buried underground, such as bronzes, jade artifacts, porcelain bowls, gold and silver jewelry, as well as ancient temples and historical sites scattered in remote villages, are state property and must not be occupied or destroyed.

    Second, when ancient tombs and ancient cultural sites are discovered, contact the cultural departments at all levels in a timely manner and report to the cultural departments.

    Third, scattered thread-bound ancient books and bronze and iron cast Buddhist statues, large bells, incense burners, etc. found in ancient temples should not be treated as scrap copper and scrap iron, but should be immediately reported to the cultural departments at all levels for handling.

    考古工作会议致函基本建设人员
    提出保护历史文物的三点要求
    27日闭幕的考古工作会议写信给基本建设中的青年突击队员，向他们提出了关于保护历史文物的三点要求：
    第一，凡是埋藏在地下的古代文物，像铜器、玉器、磁碗、金银首饰等以及散在偏僻村落的古庙和名胜古迹，都是国家财产，不要侵占或破坏；
    第二，发现古墓葬和古文化遗址的时候要及时同各级文化部门取得联系，向文化部门报告；
    第三，散在的线装古书以及从古庙里发现的铜铁铸的佛像，大钟、香炉等等，不要作为废铜废铁处理，要立即报告各级文化部门处理。　（新华社）
