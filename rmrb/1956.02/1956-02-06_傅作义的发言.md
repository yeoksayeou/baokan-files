Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou’s political report and am immensely excited.

This Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference is being convened amidst the high tide of the nationwide agricultural cooperation movement, the high tide of the handicraft industry cooperation movement, and the high tide of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Under the influence and impetus of these high tides, the speed of our country's socialist construction will be greatly accelerated. Now, all production fronts are proposing to complete and overfulfill the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan in four years or a little more. Various aspects of industry, agriculture, culture, and education are calculating time, speed, and various advanced production targets. The realization of these advanced and entirely reliable production targets presents a picture of happiness and prosperity right before our eyes.

When people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life across the country are closely united around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and are confidently engaged in the great cause of socialist construction, we must not forget for a moment that our territory of Taiwan is still under the occupation of American imperialists, and the Taiwan compatriots cannot enjoy the happiness they should enjoy like the people of the whole country. Therefore, liberating Taiwan is a common sacred task for all the people of our country, including the people of the mainland and the people of Taiwan. Premier Zhou has pointed out that the main reason why Taiwan has not been liberated to this day is that the United States is using force to occupy Taiwan and interfere in China's internal affairs. But Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Taiwan compatriots are part of the Chinese people. Liberating Taiwan is our country's internal affair, and no third party has the right to interfere. While actively preparing to liberate Taiwan by war, we are still striving to liberate Taiwan by peaceful means, calling on the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan to recognize the general trend, take the initiative to get rid of the shackles of American imperialism, and return to the embrace of the motherland.

Premier Zhou's call is very great and very sincere. It shows our deep concern for the Taiwan compatriots, and at the same time, points out a clear path for the current Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan. I believe that among the military and political personnel in Taiwan, some have participated in the resistance against foreign aggression, still have patriotism, have the intention to do good, and hope that the country will be better, and they should also understand the international situation. On the one hand, they have personally seen and suffered the contempt and manipulation of American imperialism, and at the same time, they have heard Premier Zhou's great call, which will surely deeply move them and arouse their patriotic conscience.

In order to make them make up their minds as soon as possible, I think the following issues should be explained to them.

First, don't harbor illusions. The current situation in Taiwan cannot last in any way. Because if you cannot attack, you cannot defend; if you cannot fight back to the mainland, you cannot continue to maintain the current situation. This is a simple strategic principle that everyone knows. But some people in Taiwan still pin their future on illusions, fantasizing about the outbreak of a third world war and relying on the help of American imperialism to fight back to the mainland; and fantasizing that there are still some forces in the motherland who oppose the Communist Party and can cooperate with them. Chairman Mao's great policy of unity has shattered their illusions. They think that we want to build socialism, and building socialism is in conflict with the interests of capitalists, as if this is a loophole they can exploit. However, according to Chairman Mao's policy of implementing joint state-private ownership and fixed interest rates, capitalists can peacefully transition to socialist society, their work has been properly arranged, their family life has not only not been reduced, but will continue to improve; and from then on, they will gain the honor of workers and an infinitely bright future. Therefore, capitalists beat gongs and drums, hung lanterns and colored streamers, like celebrating a happy event, to welcome socialism. Some people in Taiwan also believe that a large number of people who remained on the mainland and participated in military and political work in the old society will be discriminated against in the new society and therefore feel dissatisfied, as if this is another loophole they can exploit. However, according to Chairman Mao's policy, these people have not been discriminated against and have been properly arranged and cared for. Everyone has found their place, and their lives are much better than in the old society; more importantly, they have personally witnessed the rapid development of the country's various construction undertakings, the improvement of its international status, and the improvement of people's lives. The Chinese people have truly stood up. The wishes they have been seeking for many years have been realized today. Everyone feels excited and encouraged, and therefore loves this country and loves this society. They have already gained light and will never want to return to darkness. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, many of them have become the backbone of their work. Some people in Taiwan estimate that the vast rural areas of the New China are still the same as the rural areas during the Kuomintang's rule, with large gaps where counter-revolutionary activities can be hidden. In fact, their estimates are completely wrong. Under the high tide of agricultural cooperation, 500 million farmers have been organized. Their current lives are already well-fed and warmly clothed, and on the basis of the collective economy, they have further seen the prospects for agricultural mechanization and rural electrification. Therefore, every agricultural production cooperative is a powerful stronghold that supports the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and every farmer is a strong sentinel who defends the motherland and defends socialism. The spies dropped by Taiwan on the mainland are like falling into a dragnet, unable to move, unable to break free.

The current general international situation is trending towards relaxation. Under the unanimous demand for peace from the people of the world, a new world war can be prevented. Even if the imperialists dare to provoke a war, according to the experience of the two world wars, the imperialists themselves will inevitably suffer defeat. Because what determines the outcome of a war is the will of the people and the strength of the people. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are united like steel. This power can move mountains and seas, and this power is invincible. In order to defend the fruits of victory that have already been achieved, in order to defend the current good life, and in order to create greater happiness in the future, everyone is an iron hero in the face of difficulties, and everyone is a strong fighter in the face of aggressors. Anyone who still attempts to shake this country or shake this people's democratic regime is an illusion that can never be realized.

Second, don't be unconvinced. For a political party or a politician, the most important thing is to admit the facts. The Chinese people did not fail to give the Kuomintang the opportunity to govern, but it did nothing for more than 20 years of governance, impoverishing a large country with vast territory and population and turning it into a colony of imperialism. On the other hand, the Chinese Communist Party has only liberated the mainland for a short few years, and many good things that were previously desired but could not be done have been done. In the past, we had no industry, but now we have begun to build our own heavy industry, and various light industries related to people's lives have achieved unprecedented development. In the past, we only had a few colonial-type industrial cities in the coastal areas. Now, many regions across the country have planned to build large-scale new industrial bases and industrial cities. Agricultural production has also been increasing year by year. In 1955, the two major crops of grain and cotton exceeded the highest annual output in Chinese history by a large margin. Railways and highways are not only accessible in the inland, but also cross deserts and high mountains and ridges, leading to Xinjiang and Tibet. The Yellow River flood has been a problem that has not been solved since Yu the Great controlled the floods. In the Mao Zedong era, we must completely control it and make it serve the people. We are also actively planning and designing the large-scale Yangtze River water conservancy hub. These great socialist construction undertakings have powerfully attracted the enthusiasm and energy of the people across the country. The elderly have become younger, the youth have seen their far-reaching future, and scientific and technical experts feel that only in the New China can they fully display their talents. The construction undertaking of the New China is not only a great encouragement to the people across the country, but also a glorious example for the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries all over the world.

Sun Yat-sen proposed "The world is for all," but the Kuomintang was in power for more than 20 years, but it was everywhere for private interests. Because it was for private interests, it not only failed to unite the people across the country, but the Kuomintang itself was also divided and shrinking day by day, leaving only a few so-called confidants, who were still excluding me and attacking you. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, it is truly for public interests everywhere and for public affairs in everything. What the Communist Party wants to do is what the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and all patriotic people across the country want to do, so the scope of unity is getting larger and larger. It is not only the unity within the Communist Party, the unity of various democratic parties, the unity of various democratic classes, and the unity of various ethnic groups, but also people who used to doubt the Communist Party, oppose the Communist Party, and have directly hostile actions with the Communist Party are also closely united around the Chinese Communist Party. These iron facts prove that the old Kuomintang government has failed, and the people's revolutionary cause led by the Chinese Communist Party has been victorious and continues to create greater victories. The people have drawn conclusions about this great historical change, and history has drawn conclusions. It is useless to be unconvinced. Because the Communists believe in Marxism-Leninism and understand the laws of social development, they have seen and firmly believed in the victory of the socialist cause even when the revolutionary forces were very small. I joined the revolution relatively late, but in the past few years, I have seen countless vivid facts, comparing the past situation of old China with the current situation, which has made me sincerely admire Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. People in Taiwan, although they do not have the opportunity to see the real situation of the mainland, can also see in international activities that in all parts of the world, every citizen of the New China can stand up straight and be proud of being a citizen of the New China, and at the same time receive the due respect of the people of all countries. The improvement of the international prestige of the New China is a reflection of the improvement of domestic affairs, so they should also be convinced.

Third, everyone has a share in the revolutionary cause. The door of revolution is open to anyone at any time. Chairman Mao's policy is to unite all patriotic people and unite all possible forces. In the past, during the Liberation War, this policy was implemented, and now this policy is still being implemented on the Taiwan issue. The Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, as long as they are willing to return to the big family of the motherland, the people welcome them. As far as I am concerned, before the peaceful liberation of Beijing, I had no contact with the Communist Party and resolutely fought against the Communist Party. During the peaceful liberation of Beijing, I was also prepared to accept the punishment of the people, because I had done wrong in the past, I should admit my mistakes, and I should bear the responsibility for this mistake, but the people did not punish me, and the Communist Party treated me as a comrade, and Chairman Mao gave me full trust. After the peaceful liberation of Beijing, some people in Taiwan said that I was opportunistic, selling my body for glory, surrendering, and betraying, as if it was very shameful. But the people do not see the problem in this way. The people believe that betraying the people is betrayal and a crime. Abandoning a reactionary stand and returning to the people is a glorious uprising and a courageous revolutionary action. I am now proud and proud to be a citizen of the New China. You also have the same opportunity, but because Taiwan has not yet been liberated, the military and political personnel in Taiwan cannot enjoy the honor of the motherland, and they are ashamed and cannot hold their heads up. In fact, it is only one step away. As long as you get rid of the shackles of American imperialism and return to the embrace of the motherland, not only can you enjoy this honor, but also make the motherland achieve complete unification, the international prestige will be further improved, and the people of the whole country can concentrate their efforts on the great cause of socialist construction. Perhaps some people in Taiwan still think that what I say is insincere and that the Communist Party instructed me to say it. In fact, everything said above is absolutely true. I not only say this at the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, but I say this everywhere. It is not just me who says this, but the people of the whole country say this. As the saying goes, seeing is believing. If there are still people in Taiwan who cannot fully believe my words, and still have any doubts or concerns, as Premier Zhou said, they can come to the mainland to visit and study. We can also suggest that the government organize a delegation to visit all parts of the country, meet with their relatives and family members, and after the visit, if they are willing to return to Taiwan, the government can guarantee that they will be safely sent back.

The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and the 8 million compatriots in Taiwan, who have revolutionary traditions, are also eagerly looking forward to returning to the embrace of the motherland. This force cannot be stopped by anyone. The Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan should be aware of their responsibilities, respond to the call of the motherland, follow the wishes of the Taiwan compatriots, take the initiative to get rid of the shackles of American imperialism, and strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Participating in revolutionary work does not depend on the timing, but only on whether it contributes to the people and the revolution. The peaceful liberation of Taiwan is the final completion of the unification of the great motherland, and it also helps to eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan region. This is not only a contribution to the motherland, but also a contribution to Asian and world peace. I hope that the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan will not miss this opportunity.

    傅作义的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政治报告，并且感到无比的兴奋。
    我们这次政治协商会议正是在全国农业合作化高潮、手工业合作化高潮、对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的高潮中召开的。在这几个高潮的影响和推动之下，我国社会主义建设的速度将大大地加快，现在各个生产战线上都提出要在四年或四年多一点的时间内完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的任务。工业、农业、文化教育各个方面都在计算着时间、速度和各项先进的生产指标，实现这些先进的又是完全可靠的生产指标，就在我们眼前展现出一幅幸福美好的图景。
    当全国各族各界人民，紧紧地团结在中国共产党和毛主席周围，满怀信心地进行伟大的社会主义建设的时候，我们一刻也不能忘怀我国领土台湾还在美国帝国主义者的霸占之下，台湾同胞还不能和全国人民一样享受他们应该享受的幸福。因此解放台湾是我们全国人民，包括大陆人民和台湾人民一项共同的神圣的任务。周总理已经指出，台湾直到今天还不能获得解放的主要原因，是美国使用武力侵占台湾，干涉中国内政。但是台湾是中国的领土，台湾同胞是中国人民的一部分，解放台湾是我国的内政问题，任何第三者都无权干涉。我们在积极准备用战争方式解放台湾的同时，仍努力争取用和平方式解放台湾，号召在台湾的国民党军政人员，认清大势，主动地摆脱美国帝国主义的束缚，回到祖国的怀抱。
    周总理这个号召，是十分伟大十分恳切的。它表明了我们对台湾同胞的深切关怀，同时，也对现在在台湾的国民党军政人员指出了光明的道路。我相信现在在台湾的军政人员中，有些人是曾经参加过反抗外国的侵略的，还是有爱国心的，是有心为善的，是希望国家好的，也应该是了解国际大势的。他们一方面亲眼看到亲身受到美帝国主义的轻侮和摆布，同时听到周总理这个伟大的号召，一定会深深地受到感动，激发起自己的爱国良心。
    为了使他们早日下定决心，我觉得应当向他们说明以下几个问题。
    一、不要存幻想。台湾目前的局面，无论如何是不能持久的。因为不能攻，就不能守，不能打回大陆，就不能继续维持目前的局面。这是人人都知道的一个简单的战略上的道理。但是台湾有些人还把自己的前途寄托在幻想上，幻想第三次世界大战起来，依靠美国帝国主义的帮助，打回大陆；并且幻想在祖国内地还有一些反对共产党的力量可以和他们互相配合。毛主席伟大的团结政策，粉碎了他们这种幻想。他们认为：我们要建设社会主义，而建设社会主义是和资本家的利益相矛盾的，好像这是他们可以钻的一个空子。可是依照毛主席的政策，实行公私合营，定股定息的办法，资本家都可以和平地过渡到社会主义社会，他们的工作得到了妥善的安排，家庭生活不但没有降低，而且还要继续提高；并且从此得到劳动者的荣誉和无比光明的前途。因此，资本家们敲锣打鼓，张灯结彩，像办喜事一样，欢迎社会主义。台湾有些人还认为：留在大陆的、大量的、在旧社会参加过军政工作的人员，在新社会一定会受到歧视，因而心怀不满，这好像是他们可以钻的另一个空子。可是依照毛主席的政策，这些人没有受到歧视，并且受到了妥善的安排和照顾，人人各得其所，他们的生活比在旧社会好的多；更重要的是他们亲眼看到国家各项建设事业的飞跃发展，国际地位提高了，人民生活改善了，中国人民真正站起来了，多少年求之不得的愿望，今天实现了，人人感到兴奋鼓舞，因而热爱这个国家，热爱这个社会，他们已经得到了光明，就再也不愿退回到黑暗，在中国共产党的领导下，他们之中的很多人已经成为工作中的骨干。台湾方面有些人估计，新中国的广大农村，还和过去国民党统治时期的农村一样，空隙很大，可以隐藏反革命分子的活动。其实，他们的估计完全错了。在农业合作化的高潮下，五亿农民已经组织起来了，他们现在的生活已经是饱食暖衣，并且在集体经济的基础上，进一步看见了农业机械化、农村电气化的前途，因此每一个农业生产合作社就是一个拥护共产党、拥护毛主席的有力的据点，每一个农民都是保卫祖国、保卫社会主义的坚强的哨兵。台湾掉在大陆上的特务，就像是掉进了天罗地网一样，无法活动，无法挣脱。
    现在国际总的局势是趋向缓和的，在全世界人民一致要求和平的声势下，新的世界大战是可以被制止的，即便帝国主义者胆敢挑起战火，根据两次世界大战的经验，遭受失败的必然是帝国主义自己。因为决定战争胜负的，是人民的意志，人民的力量。在毛主席的领导下，全国人民像钢铁一样地团结起来了，这个力量可以移山倒海，这个力量是无坚不摧。中国人民为了保卫已经得到的胜利果实，为了保卫现在的美好生活，为了创造将来更大的幸福，在困难面前，每个人都是铁打的英雄，在侵略者面前，每个人都是坚强的战士，任何人如果还企图动摇这个国家，动摇这个人民民主政权，那将是一种永远不能实现的幻想。
    二、不要不服气。作为一个政党，或者是作为一个政治家来说，最重要的是要承认事实。中国人民对于国民党，不是没有给他执政的机会，但它执政20多年，一无建树，把一个广土众民的大国，弄的民穷财尽，成为帝国主义的殖民地；另一方面，中国共产党解放全国大陆，才不过短短的几年，许多过去想办而不能办到的好事，都办起来了。我们过去没有工业，现在已经开始建立起自己的重工业，有关人民生活的各种轻工业，得到空前的发展；过去，我们只是在沿海地区有少数殖民地类型的工业城市，现在，全国许多地区，有计划地建设起规模巨大的新的工业基地和工业城市。农业生产也是逐年提高，1955年粮食和棉花两类主要的农作物，比中国历史上的最高年产量都超过了很多。铁路、公路，不但在内地是四通八达，而且越过沙漠，越过高山峻岭，通向新疆，通向西藏。黄河水灾是自大禹治水以来没有解决的问题，在毛泽东时代，我们要把它完全控制起来，要它给人民服务。规模巨大的长江水利枢纽，我们也在积极进行规划设计。这些伟大的社会主义建设事业，有力地吸引了全国人民的热情和精力，老年人变得年轻了，青年人看见了自己远大的前途，科学技术专家们感觉到只有在新中国，才能充分发挥他们的才能。新中国的建设事业，不仅仅对全国人民是巨大的鼓舞力量，就是对全世界殖民地半殖民地的人民，也是一个光辉的榜样。
    孙中山先生提出“天下为公”，但国民党执政20多年，却是处处为私，因为是为私，所以不只是不能团结全国人民，就是国民党内部也是一天天分化，一天天缩小，只剩下少数几个所谓亲信人物，也还是你排挤我，我打击你。在共产党领导下，才真正是处处为公，事事为公。共产党所要办的事，就是工人、农民、知识分子和全国所有爱国人士心里所想办的事，所以团结的范围越来越大，不但是共产党党内团结，各民主党派团结，各民主阶级团结，各民族团结，而且就是过去对共产党怀疑的人，反对的人，直接和共产党有过敌对行动的人，也都在中国共产党周围紧紧地团结起来了。这些铁的事实证明，旧的国民党的政府是失败了，中国共产党所领导的人民革命事业是胜利了，并且在继续创造更大的胜利。对于这一伟大的历史变革，人民已经作了结论，历史已经作了结论，不服气是没有用的。共产党人因为信仰马克思列宁主义，懂得社会发展的规律，所以他们在革命力量很小的时候，已经看到并且坚决相信社会主义事业的胜利。我参加革命比较晚，但是几年来看到无数生动的事实，把过去旧中国的情况和现在的情况加以比较，使我对毛主席、对中国共产党心服口服，五体投地。在台湾的人们，虽然没有机会看到祖国大陆的真实情况，但是在国际活动中，也可看到在世界各地，新中国每一个人都可以挺起腰板，以自己是一个新中国的公民而感到自豪，同时受到各国人民应有的尊重。新中国国际威望的提高，正是内政修明的反映，所以他们也是应该服气的。
    三、革命事业，人人有份。革命大门在任何时候对任何人都是敞开着的。毛主席的政策是团结一切爱国的人，团结一切可能团结的力量。过去，在解放战争期间执行的是这个政策，现在在对台湾的问题上执行的还是这个政策，在台湾的国民党军政人员，只要他们愿意回到祖国大家庭中来，人民都是欢迎的。就我个人来说，北京和平解放以前，我和共产党没有任何联系，是坚决和共产党斗争的，北京和平解放时，我也准备接受人民的惩罚，因为我过去做错了，我就应该承认错误，并且应该承担这个错误的责任，但是人民没有惩罚我，共产党把我当同志般看待，毛主席给了我充分的信任。在北京和平解放以后，台湾有些人曾经说我是投机取巧，是卖身求荣，是投降，是叛变，好像是很丢人的。但人民不是这样看问题，人民认为背叛人民才是叛逆，是罪恶，放弃反动立场，回到人民中间来，是光荣的起义，是勇敢的革命行动。我现在是作为一个新中国的公民而感到自豪，感到骄傲。你们也同样有这个机会，但是，由于台湾还没有得到解放，所以在台湾的军政人员就不能享受祖国的荣誉，而且是处处自惭形秽，抬不起头来。其实，这只是一步之差，只要你摆脱美国帝国主义的束缚，回到祖国怀抱中来，不但你们可以同样享受到这个光荣，而且使祖国实现了完全的统一，国际威望更加提高，全国人民更可集中力量进行伟大的社会主义建设。可能台湾还有些人认为我说这些话是言不由衷，是共产党授意我来说的。其实上面说的都是千真万确的事实，我不仅在全国政治协商会议的大会上是这样讲，我在任何地方都是这样讲，不只是我一个人是这样讲，而是全国人民都是这样讲。俗话说：百闻不如一见，如果台湾还有人不能完全相信我的话，还有什么怀疑顾虑，正如周总理所说的，他们可以到祖国大陆来参观、学习，我们还可建议政府，让他们组织代表团，到全国各地来参观访问，和自己的亲人家属会见，参观访问完毕后，如果愿意返回台湾，政府可以保证把他们安全地送回去。
    中国人民一定要解放台湾，具有革命传统的台湾800万同胞，也迫切地期待着回到祖国的怀抱，这种力量是任何人都阻挡不住的。在台湾的国民党军政人员，应该意识到自己的责任，响应祖国的号召，遵从台湾同胞的意愿，主动摆脱美国帝国主义的束缚，争取台湾的和平解放。参加革命工作并不分时间早晚，只看对人民、对革命有没有贡献。和平解放台湾，是最后地完成伟大祖国的统一，并且有助于消除台湾地区的紧张局势，这不仅是对祖国立了功勋，而且对亚洲和世界和平也作了贡献。我希望在台湾的国民党军政人员们，不要错过这个机会。
