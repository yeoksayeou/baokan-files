Penny-Pinching Leads to Big Losses
    Li Qian
    Recently, in the construction sites of the Third and Fourth Work Areas of the Northwest Engineering Bureau Second Engineering Company (hereinafter referred to as Northwest Second Company), several buildings have appeared that have been grounded, with pillars erected and a small part of the bricks laid, and then construction stopped. This phenomenon, occurring at a time when all corners of the country are striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, is very strange. After I visited the people in charge of these two construction sites, I learned that houses started after October last year have suffered the same fate. This is the result of the relevant units penny-pinching and wrangling with each other.
    According to the design specifications, the roof panels and beams of these houses are prefabricated components. Because the Northwest Engineering Bureau did not sufficiently recognize the importance of building construction bases, it did not build a prefabrication yard early on. It was not until September last year, when the project was about to start, that it decided to let the Second Company prepare to build a large prefabrication yard. This already harbored the crisis of insufficient supply of prefabricated components. What is particularly serious is that the relevant parties did not cooperate well in the preparation process of the prefabrication yard. After receiving instructions to prepare for the construction of the prefabrication yard, the Northwest Second Company selected a site that was about the same distance from each work area and designed it without the approval of the Xi'an Municipal Construction Bureau. When the design drawings were completed, the Construction Bureau did not approve it. The Northwest Second Company had to find another location, but the Construction Bureau did not approve the second location either. The reason why the Construction Bureau did not approve was mainly because it believed that the two sites were not in line with the urban construction plan. In fact, it did not hinder the urban construction plan. Although the third location was approved by the Construction Bureau, the construction units of the Third and Fourth Work Areas disagreed, because the new prefabrication yard site was relatively far away from them, and the freight they would bear in the future would be relatively large. At the same time, they felt that the construction of this factory was relatively late, and it was not worthwhile to invest a lot of money in such a semi-permanent project for only a few months. They actively prepared to build small temporary prefabrication yards near the work area for about half a year of use. Because the site and construction costs of the large prefabrication yard were not resolved for a long time, the Northwest Engineering Bureau agreed to build small prefabrication yards in each work area. As a result, the small prefabrication yards began production, but the funding problem of the large prefabrication yard was not resolved. It was not until December that the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened relevant parties to hold a meeting and decided that Party A would hand over 300,000 yuan of base construction funds to Party B. The construction of the large prefabrication yard was delayed until the end of December, and it only began production in February this year. Before the large prefabrication yard started construction, prefabricated components had to be supplied by temporary prefabrication yards. If one small yard cannot supply enough, another one is built. Up to now, four small prefabrication yards have been built. Not to mention the waste of manpower and funds, but also due to the simple equipment and poor management of the small prefabrication yards, prefabricated components are still not supplied adequately. The construction plan of the construction site has been disrupted. The construction site urges the prefabrication yard all day long, and the prefabrication yard has to send a little to the construction site as soon as it is done; the construction site also installs a little component as it comes, "three days of fishing, two days of drying nets." The large cranes for hoisting prefabricated components also have to move around all day long because of this. In order to avoid the danger of large machinery passing through high-voltage power lines, the general power switch is often turned off, so the utilization rate of machinery and labor productivity are very low, and the progress of the project cannot be guaranteed. For example, the main structure of Building No. 19 in the Third Work Area was originally planned to be completed in December last year, but it has not been completed until now because the supply of prefabricated components is not adequate. The main structures of Buildings No. 7, 15, and 25 in the Fourth Work Area were also originally planned to be completed in December last year, but they have been delayed until now because there are no prefabricated components.
    Basic construction work is an extremely complex task, involving a wide range, and all departments must overcome departmentalism and handle problems from the overall interests. Penny-pinching will cause great losses to the country. The problem of the architectural prefabrication yard mentioned above is a good lesson for basic construction units.

    打小算盘，吃了大亏
    李茜
    最近，在西北工程管理局第二工程公司（以下简称西北二公司）三工区和四工区的工地上，出现了几幢已经打好地坪，竖起柱子，砌了一小部分砖就停工的房子。这种现象发生在全国各个角落都在争取提前完成五年计划的今天，令人非常奇怪。当我访问了这两个工地的负责人以后，才知道去年10月份以后开工的房子，差不多都遭到同样的命运。这是有关单位打小算盘，相互扯皮的结果。
    按照设计规定，这些房子的屋面板和大梁都是预制构件。由于西北工程管理局对建筑基地的建设的重要性认识不足，没有及早建设预制场，直到去年9月份工程即将开工的时候，才决定让二公司筹建大型预制场。这已经潜伏了预制构件供应不及时的危机。尤其严重的是，在预制场的筹建过程中，各有关方面又没有很好配合协作。西北二公司接到筹建预制场的指示后，就在距离各工区远近都差不多的地方选择了一个场址，在没有经西安市建设局批准前就进行了设计。等设计图都已经画好了，建设局不批准。西北二公司只好另找地点，第二次选的地点建设局也不批准。建设局所以不批准，主要是认为这两个场地不合于城市建设规划。实际上并没有妨碍城市建设规划。第三次选择的地点虽然获得建设局批准了，但是，三工区和四工区的建设单位又不同意，因为新的预制场场址距离他们比较远，将来担负的运费比较大，同时他们感到这个厂建设得比较晚了，拿出很多钱来向这样一个半永久性的工程投资，自己的工程只用几个月，太不合算。他们各自积极筹备在工区旁边建设使用半年左右的小型临时预制场。西北工程管理局因为大型预制场的场址和建筑费用迟迟没有解决，也就同意在各工区搞小型预制场。结果是小型预制场开始生产了，大型预制场的资金问题还没有解决，一直拖到12月份才由中共西安市委召集有关方面开会，决定甲方把30万元的基地建设资金交给乙方。大型预制场就这样一直拖到12月底才开工建设，今年2月份才开始投入生产。在大型预制场没开工以前，预制构件只好由临时预制场供应。一个小场供应不了再建一个，到现在已经搞了四个小预制场。人力和资金的浪费不必说，而且由于小型预制场的设备简单和管理不善，直到现在预制构件还是供应不上。工地的施工计划被打乱了。工地整天催预制场，预制场只好作好一点就向工地送一点；工地也是来一点构件就安一点，“三天打鱼，两天晒网。”装吊预制构件的大型起重机也不得不因此而整天移动。为了避免大型机械经过高压电线时发生危险，关总电门的事情也经常发生，所以，机械利用率和劳动生产率都很低，工程进度更无法保证。如三工区19号房子原计划去年12月份完成主体结构，因为预制构件供应不上，直到现在还没完成。四工区7号、15号、25号房子原计划去年12月份完成主体结构，也因为没有预制构件而拖到现在。
    基本建设工作是一项极其复杂的工作，牵涉的范围很广，各部门必需克服本位主义思想，从整体利益出发处理问题。自己打小算盘就会使国家吃大亏。前面所谈的建筑预制场的问题对基本建设单位就是一个很好的教训。
