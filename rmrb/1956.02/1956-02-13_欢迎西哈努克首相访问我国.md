    Welcoming Prime Minister Sihanouk's Visit to Our Country

    Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, is scheduled to arrive in our country today for a friendly visit at our invitation. The Chinese people warmly welcome the distinguished guest from our neighboring country and believe that this marks a new beginning in the restoration of friendly relations between China and Cambodia and an important development in the growing solidarity and cooperation among Asian countries.

    The Chinese and Cambodian peoples have a long history of friendly relations. According to Chinese historical records, friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples began as early as 1,700 years ago. During this long-standing friendly exchange between the two peoples, Chinese people gradually migrated to Cambodia. They have worked diligently in Cambodia, passing down their traditions through generations, and have become an integral part of Cambodia's economic life. Our overseas Chinese have lived with the Cambodian people for a long time and have established deep friendships. These historical facts fully demonstrate that the Chinese and Cambodian peoples are capable of living together in harmony.

    However, the historical friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples has been artificially obstructed in modern times and has not been able to develop. This is because both our countries have suffered from colonialist oppression, and this shared oppression has hindered the free exchanges between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples. Only today, when the Chinese people have completely shaken off the shackles of colonialism and the Cambodian people have embarked on the road of independent and autonomous development, is friendly exchange between our two countries possible again.

    Our government and people have always pursued a foreign policy of peace, and especially hope to maintain sincere good-neighborly and friendly relations with our neighbors. The Chinese people believe that all countries, regardless of size, should be treated as equals, and that the political and economic systems and ways of life chosen by the people of each country should be respected, while opposing interference in other countries' internal affairs and the policy of organizing military blocs. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by our Premier and the Indian Prime Minister have become the guideline for friendly relations between countries. The friendly relations between our country and India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan are based on these famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Our country and these countries are making joint efforts to safeguard peace in Asia and the world and to promote the cause of friendly cooperation among countries. Friendly exchanges between our people and the peoples of Pakistan, Ceylon, and Japan are developing rapidly. Exchanges between our people and the Thai people have also begun to resume. Our people are willing to maintain friendly relations with any country, as long as there is a mutual desire for peace and friendship.

    The restoration and development of friendly and cooperative relations between our country and the Kingdom of Cambodia are based on a common foundation. Both the Kingdom of Cambodia and our country participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference and the 1955 Bandung Conference. At the Geneva Conference, both of our countries contributed to the restoration of peace in Indochina. Especially at the Bandung Conference, Prime Minister Sihanouk and our Premier Zhou Enlai had friendly contacts, which enhanced understanding between the two countries. Both of our countries agree with the principles in the Asian-African Conference Communiqué, namely, opposing colonialism, promoting world peace, and strengthening friendly cooperation among countries. After the Asian-African Conference, Prime Minister Sihanouk repeatedly expressed his acceptance of the principles of peaceful coexistence, his determination to pursue a policy of neutrality, not to allow any country to establish military bases in Cambodia, not to participate in military blocs, and not to allow any country to use Cambodia as a military transit station. On February 6, after returning to Phnom Penh from a visit to the Philippines, Prime Minister Sihanouk clearly pointed out: "We must adhere to neutrality and not participate in any bloc. The first thing we must do is redouble our efforts to irrigate our rice fields. Let us rely on ourselves and not depend on foreign countries." These views and propositions of Prime Minister Sihanouk reflect the will of the Cambodian people to safeguard national independence and peace.

    Although there are differences in the political and economic systems between our country and the Kingdom of Cambodia, there are indeed many common interests and aspirations between our two countries. Therefore, the restoration and development of friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries are not only possible, but also very necessary. This necessity is not only manifested in the issue of safeguarding peace in Asia and Indochina, but also exists in the interests of economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries. The strengthening of friendly relations between our two countries will promote the development of equal and mutually beneficial trade relations, learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, so as to accelerate the common development and prosperity of the two countries' economic construction and improve the living standards of the people of each country.

    The Chinese people warmly welcome Prime Minister Sihanouk's friendly visit to our country and sincerely hope for the normalization of relations between China and Cambodia. The Chinese people believe that through Prime Minister Sihanouk's friendly visit, and through the joint efforts of the two governments and peoples, adhering to the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences as demonstrated at the Asian-African Conference, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will surely be restored and developed. The restoration and development of friendly relations between our two countries will be a great contribution to strengthening solidarity and cooperation among Asian countries and strengthening peace in Asia.

### 欢迎西哈努克首相访问我国

    欢迎西哈努克首相访问我国
    应邀到我国作友好访问的柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王，定于今天前来我国。中国人民热烈欢迎邻国的贵宾的远道来访，并认为这是中柬两国恢复友好关系的新的开端，也是亚洲各国日益团结合作中的一个重要发展。
    中国人民和柬埔寨人民之间有着悠久的友好关系。据中国的史书记载，早在1，700年前，中柬两国人民就开始了友好往来。在两国人民这种历史悠久的友好往来中，我国人民陆续移居到柬埔寨。他们在柬埔寨辛勤劳动，世代相传，已经成为柬埔寨经济生活中的一个组成部分。我国侨民同柬埔寨人民长期生活在一起，建立了深厚的友情。这些历史上的事实，充分表明中柬两国人民是能够友好相处的。
    但是，中柬两国人民间的历史友谊，近代以来却遭到人为的阻碍，不能得到发展。这是由于我们两国都曾经受到殖民主义的压迫，我们两国人民所受过的这种共同压迫一直阻挠中柬两国人民的自由交往。只有在今天中国人民已经彻底摆脱了殖民主义的束缚，柬埔寨人民也走上了独立自主发展的道路的时候，我们两国才又有了友好往来的可能。
    我国政府和人民一向执行和平外交政策，尤其是希望同自己的邻国保持真诚的睦邻友好关系。中国人民认为，一切国家不分大小都应该平等相待，应当尊重各国人民自己选择的政治、经济制度和生活方式，而反对干涉别国的内政和组织军事集团的政策。我国总理和印度总理共同倡导的和平共处的五项原则，已经成为各国友好相处的准绳。我国同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、阿富汗之间所存在的友好关系，就是建立在这个著名的和平共处五项原则的基础上的。我国和这些国家为了维护亚洲和世界的和平，促进各国友好合作的事业，进行着共同努力。我国人民和巴基斯坦、锡兰、日本人民之间的友好往来在迅速发展中。我国和泰国人民之间也开始恢复往来。我国人民愿意和任何国家保持友好关系，只要彼此都有着和平和友好的愿望。
    我国同柬埔寨王国恢复和发展友好合作关系，是有着共同的基础的。柬埔寨王国和我国都是1954年日内瓦会议和1955年万隆会议的参加者。在日内瓦会议上，我们两国为恢复印度支那和平，都作了贡献。特别是在万隆会议上，西哈努克首相和我国总理周恩来有过友好的接触，增进了两国的了解。我们两国都赞同亚非会议公报中的各项原则，即反对殖民主义，促进世界和平，加强各国间的友好合作。在亚非会议以后，西哈努克首相曾一再表示接受和平共处的各项原则，决心奉行中立政策，不容许任何国家在柬埔寨建立军事基地，不参加军事集团，也不让任何国家把柬埔寨作为军事转运站。西哈努克首相2月6日在访问菲律宾回到金边以后就曾明确地指出：“我们一定要遵守中立，不参加任何集团。我们要做的事情首先是加倍努力，来灌溉我们的稻田。让我们依靠我们自己，不要依赖外国。”西哈努克首相的这些见解和主张，反映了柬埔寨人民维护民族独立与和平的意志。
    尽管我国和柬埔寨王国存在政治制度和经济制度的不同，但是我们两国之间的确有着许多共同的利益和愿望。因此，我们两国之间友好合作关系的恢复和发展，不仅是可能的，而且是十分必要的。这种必要性，不仅表现在维护亚洲和印度支那和平的问题上，也存在于两国的经济和文化交流的利益方面。我们两国友好关系的加强，将会促进两国之间平等互利的贸易关系的发展，取长补短，互通有无，以加速两国经济建设的共同发展和繁荣，提高各自国家人民的生活水平。
    中国人民十分欢迎西哈努克首相到我国进行友好访问，并衷心愿望着中柬两国关系的正常化。中国人民相信，经过西哈努克首相这次友好访问，经过两国政府和人民的共同努力，互相本着在亚非会议上所表现出来的求同存异的精神，两国之间的友好合作关系一定能够得到恢复和发展。我们两国友好关系恢复和发展，对于加强亚洲各国间团结合作和加强亚洲的和平将是巨大的贡献。
