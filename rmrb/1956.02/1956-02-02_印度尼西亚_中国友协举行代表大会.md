Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 31st: The Indonesia-China Friendship Association held a reception on the evening of January 29th to celebrate the conclusion of its congress. Huang Zhen, the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, and his wife, along with Zhao Zhongshi, the Chinese Consul General in Jakarta, were invited to attend the reception.

    Mengadas Nasution, Chairman of the Presidium of the Congress, read out the declaration of the Congress, which stated that one of the most important ways to achieve world peace is to establish the broadest solidarity between countries, including between Indonesia and China, on the basis of mutual understanding and cultural exchange. Friendly relations between Indonesia and China were established as early as the fourth century, and were only interrupted by foreign interference. The declaration stated: However, now that both countries have achieved independence, there is no longer anything to prevent them from continuing their friendly relations with each other in a new belief in consolidating world peace and security.

    The Congress decided to entrust the Jakarta Indonesia-China Friendship Association with the responsibility of liaison between Indonesia-China Friendship Associations throughout the country, while the local associations will continue to maintain independence from each other.

    Ambassador Huang Zhen made a brief speech at the meeting. He congratulated the success of the Congress and expressed his belief that after this Congress, greater achievements will be made in consolidating friendly cooperation and promoting economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries.

    Former Indonesian Ambassador to China, Mononutu, also spoke at the meeting. He spoke of the rapid progress of construction in New China and praised the Chinese government's achievements in promoting traditional culture.
