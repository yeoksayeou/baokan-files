    Xinhua News Agency, February 3rd: The Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China convened the Fifth National Supervisory Work Conference from January 20th to February 3rd. The conference summarized the supervisory work of 1955, discussed the supervisory work plan for 1956 and 1957, and the long-term plan for national supervisory work from 1956 to 1967.
    The conference determined that in 1956 and 1957, national supervisory organs should concentrate their efforts on opposing right-leaning conservative ideology in various economic construction projects, especially in industrial construction, fully tap potential strength, supervise and promote the correct implementation of the State Council's resolutions and orders by various administrative organs and enterprise departments, to ensure the comprehensive, over-fulfilled and early completion of the country's first five-year plan. In agriculture, supervisory organs should focus on inspecting the implementation of agricultural cooperativization guidelines and policies and basic measures for increasing agricultural production by relevant administrative organs and personnel, to ensure the active and healthy development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the over-fulfillment of agricultural production plans. Inspection tasks were also stipulated in transportation, commerce, culture, education, health, and other fields.
    The conference criticized the right-leaning conservative ideology in supervisory work, which lacked strong principles, ideology, and combativeness, and lagged behind reality and the masses, as well as shortcomings such as a lack of comprehensive planning, a procrastinating work style, and serious formalism.
    During the conference, Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture, was invited to the meeting to explain the Draft National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967). Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Luo Ruiqing, Director of the First Office of the State Council, attended the meeting and gave important instructions.
