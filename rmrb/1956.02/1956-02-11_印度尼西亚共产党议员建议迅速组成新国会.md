Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 10th: The Indonesian Parliament began discussing a government-proposed bill to amend the election law on the evening of February 9th. According to the government's announcement, the purpose of this bill is to accelerate the establishment of a new parliament.

    The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported on February 9th that the parliamentary groups of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, and some other parties in the parliament do not oppose this bill. The newspaper said that Sakirman, the leader of the Indonesian Communist Party's parliamentary group, suggested that the bill stipulate that elected members of parliament must report within 10 days after the Central Election Committee issues a notification, and submit their credentials within the subsequent 5 days. Sakirman pointed out that if his suggestion is adopted, the new parliament could be formed by March 20th.

    Sakirman said that the Credentials Examination Committee should have no fewer than five members. Last November, the Indonesian Communist Party protested to the cabinet against the establishment of a Credentials Examination Committee that did not include representatives from the Indonesian Communist Party.

    印度尼西亚共产党议员建议迅速组成新国会
    新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚国会在2月9日晚上开始讨论政府提出的一项修改选举法的法案。据政府宣布，这项法案的目的是为了加速成立新国会。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”2月9日报道，在国会中的印度尼西亚国民党、印度尼西亚共产党和其他一些党派的国会党团不反对这个法案。这家报纸说，印度尼西亚共产党国会党团领袖萨基尔曼建议法案规定当选的议员必须在中央选举委员会发出通知电以后10天之内报到，并且在以后的5天之内递交他们的证书。萨基尔曼指出，如果采纳他的建议，新国会到3月20日就可以组成。
    萨基尔曼说，议员当选证书审查委员会的委员名额不应该少于5个。印度尼西亚共产党在去年11月曾经向内阁提出抗议，反对成立不包括印度尼西亚共产党代表的证书审查委员会。
