    Such "Autonomous Trends"
    For more than three years, British colonialists in Kenya, East Africa, have been cruelly suppressing and massacring the local people. 60,000 innocent Kenyans have been imprisoned in concentration camps. However, while washing their hands with the blood of Kenyans, the British colonialists have not forgotten to create a facade of so-called "autonomous trends." They spent nearly a year "studying" how to "use the best methods for local Africans to elect members of the Legislative Council." This is because in the original "Legislative Council" with 54 members, Africans, who account for more than 90% of the Kenyan population, had only 6 members, and they were appointed by the British Governor. This was hardly "autonomous."
    Now, the "best methods" have been "studied" and are ready to be applied in March 1957. According to a report from Nairobi by a "Times" reporter on January 10th, the British colonial authorities have stipulated 10 qualifications for the "voters" of this "election." A voter must possess at least some of these "10 qualifications" to cast a vote, and if they possess one more qualification, they can cast another vote.
    These "10 qualifications" are indeed, as praised by the "Times" editorial, a "carefully crafted document." In addition to being 21 years old and having a certain level of education, "voters" must also have the following "qualifications": "Serving in the army, police, or tribal police for 5 years; having a guaranteed income of £120 from a business, profession, or agriculture, or property worth £500; reaching the status or age equivalent to a tribal chief or chieftainess, or being 45 years old; being awarded a civil or military medal in addition to a military medal; serving for five years in a town district council, local council, African advisory council, or in an African court; holding a responsible position in a farm, business, government or local government, or private enterprise for 10 years; being awarded a medal or certificate for 20 years of continuous loyal service; and finally, having a women's club membership badge."
    If he is from the largest tribe in Africa, that is, the tribe that resists British colonial oppression the most strongly, such as the Gikuyu, Embu, or Meru people, even if he possesses these "qualifications," he still cannot cast a vote. He must also pass the final "loyalty test." The "Times" reporter reported that "the loyalty test will include proof of having actively supported the Crown during the emergency." Only when it is finally proven that an African is truly loyal to the British colonialists and has participated with them in massacring their own African people's anti-colonial patriotic armed forces, can he be fortunate enough to obtain the "voter" qualification bestowed by the British colonialists.
    Thus, on a day in March 1957, the "voters" who go to the polls according to this "best method" formulated by the British colonialists will only be of one kind: those who have succumbed to or are loyal to the British colonialists. This is the truth of the British Commonwealth's "great pioneering in self-government" in "many territories," as mentioned by British Prime Minister Eden in his speech to the US Senate on February 2nd.

### 如此“自治的趋势”

    如此“自治的趋势”
    英国殖民地者在东非的怯尼亚残酷地镇压和屠杀当地人民已经三年多了。6万无辜的怯尼亚人被囚禁在集中营里。然而英国殖民者在用怯尼亚人的血洗他们的手的时候，并没有忘记制造一种粉饰门面的所谓“自治的趋势”。他们用了将近一年的时间，“研究”了怎样“使用最好的方法以便当地非洲人选举立法议会议员”。这是因为在原来的有54名议员的“立法议会”中，占怯尼亚人口90％以上的非洲人只有6名议员，而且还是英国总督指派的。这未免太不像“自治”了。
    现在，“最好的方法”已经“研究”出来了，并且准备在1957年3月应用。据英国“泰晤士报”记者1月10日自内罗毕报道，英国殖民当局为这次“选举”的“选民”规定了10项资格，最少必须具有这“10项资格”中的若干项才能投一票，如果再多具备一项资格，就可以多投一票。
    这“10项资格”的规定，确实像“泰晤士报”社论所赞美的是“精心制作的文件”。“选民”除了要有年龄为21岁和一定的教育程度两项资格以外，还要有这样的“资格”：“在军队、警察或部落警察中任职5年者；自一种商业、职业或农业中有保证的收入达120镑者，或财产达500镑者；达到相当于部落族长或女族长的地位或年龄达45岁者；除军功章之外获有民事或军事勋章者；在城镇的区议会、地方议会或非洲人的咨询议会中，或在非洲人的法院中任职五年者；在农庄、商业、政府或地方政府，或私人企业中任负责职位达10年者；由于20年来连续忠诚服务而获有奖章或证明书者；最后，具有妇女俱乐部会员徽章者。”
    如果他是一个非洲人中最大的部落，也就是反抗英国的殖民压迫最强烈的部落，像吉古宇、艾摩或梅鲁人的话，即使具备了这些“资格”，还是不能去投一票。他还必须通过最后一道“忠诚考查”的关口。“泰晤士报”记者报道说，“忠诚考查将包括要有在紧急状态期间曾经积极支持过皇家的证明”。只有在最后证明一个非洲人确确实实效忠于英国殖民者，并同他们一起屠杀过非洲人民自己的反殖民主义的爱国武装的时候，他才可能有幸取得英国殖民者所赏赐的“选民”的资格。
    这样，到1957年3月里的一天，根据英国殖民者制定的这个“最好的方法”而找到的走到投票箱前的“选民”只有一种：屈服于或者是效忠于英国殖民者的人。这就是英国首相艾登2月2日在美国参议院发表的演说中所说的英联邦“许多领土内”的“在自治方面的伟大进取事业”的真相。　（田）
