The First Five-Year Plan project for harnessing the Huai River will be completed ahead of schedule. By the end of 1955, 88.5% of the total project workload had been completed.

The person in charge of the Huai River Harnessing Committee said that the design and construction levels of the project have improved significantly. In the past, it took more than a year to design a reservoir, but now it only takes a few months for some reservoirs. In construction, due to the accumulation of rich experience in planning and management, and the increase in mechanized construction forces, work efficiency has generally increased by one to two times. In addition, the upsurge of agricultural cooperation has inspired the vast number of workers in harnessing the Huai River. As long as we tap the potential strength, we are fully confident of completing the First Five-Year Plan project for harnessing the Huai River ahead of schedule, and start the Second Five-Year Plan project early.

The completion of the First Five-Year Plan project for harnessing the Huai River will bring great benefits to the economic development of the Huai River basin. In terms of flood control, the Huai River main embankment can ensure that it is not affected by floods of the 1954 type. In terms of waterlogging elimination, 9,000 square kilometers of land will avoid the disaster of internal waterlogging once every five years, basically guaranteeing the wheat harvest in the Huai River basin. At the same time, hydropower generation, irrigation, and shipping have also begun. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    治淮第一个五年计划工程可提前完成
    治淮第一个五年计划工程将提前完成。到1955年底，工程总工作量已经完成88.5％。
    治淮委员会负责人说，现在工程的设计、施工水平已有显著提高，过去设计一个水库要一年多时间，现在有些水库只要几个月时间就可以了；在施工中由于积累了丰富的计划管理经验，增加了机械化施工力量，工作效率也普遍提高一倍至两倍；再加上农业合作化高潮给治淮广大职工的鼓舞，只要我们挖掘潜在力量，就完全有把握提前完成治淮第一个五年计划工程，提早做第二个五年计划工程。
    治淮第一个五年计划工程完成后，对淮河流域的经济发展将带来很大好处。在防洪方面，淮河干堤可确保1954年型洪水不受灾，在除涝方面，将有9，000平方公里的土地，避免了五年一遇的内涝灾害，基本上保证了淮河流域的麦收。同时还开始了水力发电、灌溉和航运事业。　（据新华社讯）
