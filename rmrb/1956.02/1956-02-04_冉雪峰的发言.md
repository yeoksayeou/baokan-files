Chairman, fellow committee members: As an aging and senile traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, I am deeply honored to be invited to attend this meeting and gather with all of you to discuss national affairs. Under the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our country's socialist revolution has entered a high tide. Recently, the draft National Agricultural Development Program Outline from 1956 to 1967, proposed by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, has been embraced by the broad masses of the people, giving farmers, agricultural workers, and all work departments related to agriculture a clearer goal to strive for. With the socialist construction of agriculture, the lives of farmers will gradually improve, and prosperous and affluent production will inevitably lead to reasonable and legitimate demands. Medical and health work is also an important part of this. Therefore, the agricultural development outline instructs the elimination of various diseases that are most harmful to the people, such as smallpox, cholera, plague, malaria, and human parasites. I am a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, and I would like to talk about some of my personal feelings regarding the work of traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine has a long history of thousands of years. In the long-term struggle against diseases, it has accumulated rich experience and made important contributions to the health of the people throughout the ages. Even today, traditional Chinese medicine is still an indispensable part of the entire medical and health care undertaking. The number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners is the largest, widely spread, deeply integrated with the vast number of farmers, and there is no rural corner without traditional Chinese medicine. In this agricultural development, the mission and responsibility borne by health care, prevention and treatment, and the elimination of diseases are considerable. All my rural medical comrades must do this work well, so as to provide a strong supplement to the entire agricultural development.

In the old society, under the autocratic and bad government, and under the abusive government of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, traditional Chinese medicine was discriminated against, restricted, and destroyed, almost to the point of extinction. After liberation, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government treated the issue of traditional Chinese medicine with an essential difference. The Party has always valued the cultural heritage of the motherland and regarded the unity and cooperation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine as an important policy for traditional Chinese medicine. In recent years, the health administration departments have achieved many successes due to following this policy. In my personal practice, I have deeply experienced that traditional Chinese medicine has its own unique methods for treating diseases. Now, with academic exchanges between Chinese and Western medicine, in the future, convergence, integration, and development will create a special Chinese medicine, which is not only a major event for the health of the Chinese people, but also a great contribution to the people of the world. However, people with bourgeois mentality believe that traditional Chinese medicine is not scientific. My personal opinion: Effectiveness is the expression of truth. Through practice, if it can cure diseases and remain effective permanently, it has scientific reasoning. It can be seen that the rude rejection and discrimination against traditional Chinese medicine ideas and sayings are completely wrong.

The socialist construction of our country is rising day by day, and all aspects of the cause must cooperate with the general trend of development. Inheriting and developing the medical heritage of the motherland is also to serve socialist construction. We must unite Chinese and Western medicine, each doing our best in terms of facts and each knowing our best in terms of theory, and jointly strive to undertake this historic, arduous, and glorious task. The rise of Soviet medicine is based on the culture of the motherland. We are following the advanced path paved by the Soviet Union and moving forward, and we will surely succeed quickly and become a new type of medicine, but there is still much practical work to be done. Medical comrades! Strive harder!

Currently, according to Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation, traditional Chinese medicine work should also be comprehensively planned. We must strengthen leadership, improve the political and technical level of existing traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, so that they can evolve with the evolution of the times; vigorously carry out research on traditional Chinese medicine; universally promote traditional Chinese medicine learning from Western medicine and Western medicine learning from traditional Chinese medicine, with the focus especially on Western medicine learning from traditional Chinese medicine; increase the number of traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, promote clinical experiments, open traditional Chinese medicine schools, cultivate reserve forces, and fully utilize the potential of traditional Chinese medicine in order to better serve the development of industrial and agricultural production. Although I am old, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I feel deeply happy and excited, and my ambition has not waned. I will not slack off in this ambition. I am willing to follow the comrades of the national medical work team, pool our wisdom and efforts, contribute the due strength, strive to inherit and develop the medicine of the motherland, and do my part for the socialist construction of our country. Finally, I wish all leaders and members good health.

    冉雪峰的发言
    主席、各位委员：一个年已迟暮衰老中医的我，能够应邀出席这个会议，与各位委员济济一堂，协商国家大事，曷胜荣幸。我们的国家，在中国共产党和毛主席正确英明领导下，社会主义革命已进入了高潮。近来中共中央政治局所提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案，受到广大人民的拥护，使全国农民、农业工作者及与农业有关的各个工作部门均有了更明确的奋斗目标。随着农业的社会主义建设，农民的生活逐渐提高，必将由繁荣富裕的生产，提出相需正当要求。医药卫生工作，也是其中一个重要部分。所以农业发展纲要中，指示消灭危害人民最大的各项病症，如天花、霍乱、鼠疫、疟疾、人体寄生虫等。我是一个中医，现就中医工作，谈谈个人的一些感觉。祖国医学，有数千年悠久历史，在长期与疾病斗争中，积累了丰富的经验，对于历代人民的健康，作过重要的贡献，直到现今，中医仍为整个医疗保健事业中不可缺少的部分。中医人数最多，广遍深入，与广大农民结合亲密，无一处农村角落里没有中医。在这个农业发展当中，卫生保健、预防治疗、消灭疾病，所肩的使命，所负的责任，是相当大的。凡我农村医务同志，务必要将这个工作搞好，以为整个农业发展强有力的补助。
    中医前在旧社会里，在专制不良政府里，在蒋匪帮滥权政府里，遭到歧视钳制摧残，几至消灭。解放后，中国共产党和人民政府对待中医的问题，则有了本质的不同。党向来重视祖国文化遗产，把中西医的团结合作列为重要的中医政策。几年来，卫生行政部门由于遵循了这一政策，因而取得不少的成绩。个人在实践中，深刻的体验到中医治疗疾病，确有其独到的地方。现中西学术交流，将来汇通化合，光大发扬，蔚为中国特殊医学，不仅是中国人民保健的一件大事，对于世界人民也有很大的贡献。而具有资产阶级心理的人，认为中医不科学。个人意见：有效为真理的表现。经过实践，能治好病，永久有效，即有科学道理，可见那种粗暴的排斥歧视中医思想和说法是完全不对的。
    我们国家的社会主义建设，日益高涨，各方面事业，都要配合总的发展趋势。继承和发扬祖国医学遗产，也是为社会主义建设服务。一定要中西医团结，对事实各尽所能，对学理各尽所知，共奋发担负起这一有历史性艰巨光荣的任务。苏联医学勃兴，是筑基在祖国文化长起来的。我们循着苏联先进铺平了的道路前进，一定成功快，会成为一个新型的医学，但还要做许多实际工作。医务同志们！努力努力。
    目前根据毛主席对农业合作化的提示，中医工作也要作全面的规划。要加强领导，提高现有中医的政治与技术水平，俾能随时代的进化而进化；大力作好中医药研究工作，普遍展开中医向西医学习、西医向中医学习，重心尤放在西医向中医学习上；增设中医医院，推广临床实验，开办中医学校，培养后备力量，充分发挥中医潜力，以便为工农业生产发展更好的服务。个人年虽衰老，但在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席领导下，深深感到快愉和兴奋，壮心未已，此志不懈，愿随全国医务工作同志后，群策群力，贡献出应有的力量，为继承和发扬祖国医学而奋斗，为我国的社会主义建设尽到我一分责任。最后祝各位首长和各位委员身体健康。
