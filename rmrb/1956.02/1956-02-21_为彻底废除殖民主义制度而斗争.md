    Today, as we commemorate the Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System, it carries particularly important significance. Currently, people who are resolutely struggling for and safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty are uniting unprecedentedly, using an irresistible force to impact the colonial system; the imperialist colonial system is disintegrating. Just as Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his report to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: The complete abolition of the shameful colonial system has now been put on the agenda as the most acute and pressing issue.
    The colonial system is a serious obstacle hindering the development of human history, causing the people of many countries to be in a long-term state of powerlessness, poverty, and backwardness. The people of these countries have been engaged in heroic and unyielding struggles to win freedom and independence and to break free from the shackles of colonial enslavement. However, only under the influence of the great October Revolution did the national liberation movements of colonial and semi-colonial peoples develop particularly powerfully, causing a profound crisis for the entire imperialist colonial system. The great victory of the Chinese people's revolution once again dealt a heavy blow to the colonial system, greatly inspiring the confidence and courage of the world's oppressed nations to fight for freedom and independence.
    Currently, the oppressed peoples of the world are undergoing a great process of national renaissance. The historical face of Asia has undergone fundamental changes. The Republic of India has emerged as a major power on the world's political stage. Burma, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Syria, Nepal, and other former colonial countries have embarked on the path of independent development. Many other Asian countries are resolutely fighting for freedom and independence. In what was once considered "dark Africa," the peoples of Egypt and Sudan have also achieved independence, and the peoples of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Kenya, Rhodesia, and many other African countries have awakened, and their heroic struggles against colonial oppression have shaken the world. In Latin America, in Brazil, Chile, and other countries, the national liberation movement is also developing, so much so that colonialists have to frequently resort to tyrannical means such as instigating coups and armed interventions to suppress the people of these countries.
    The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955 demonstrated the determination of Asian and African countries to completely abolish the colonial system and resolutely safeguard national independence and state sovereignty. The Bandung spirit generated by the convening of the Asian-African Conference was also vividly reflected in the 10th United Nations General Assembly. At this conference, representatives of Asian and African countries sharply condemned colonialism.
    However, the colonial countries are not reconciled to their defeat. They are struggling in every possible way to maintain the remaining colonies and to put those countries that have embarked on the path of independent development back under their dark rule. In the face of the unprecedented upsurge of the people's movements for independence, the American aggressive bloc, in addition to continuing to use the tricks of sowing discord and bloody violence, is also adopting new forms such as so-called "aid" to backward countries and the organization of military blocs, attempting to restore and maintain its colonial rule. The so-called military and economic "aid" proposals put forward by the United States to some Asian and African countries are attached with mandatory political conditions, which are to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, forcing them to provide military bases and participate in aggressive military blocs. Military blocs such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact were established as new ways to implement colonial enslavement of the people of Asian and African countries. The so-called economic "aid" of the United States to backward countries is to obstruct the industrialization of these countries, turning them into sources of raw materials and markets for product sales for the United States. Many Asian and African countries oppose and refuse to participate in military blocs and oppose American "aid" in order to defend their national independence and oppose the enslavement of colonialism.
    The facts are becoming increasingly clear that the American aggressive bloc is not only the main supporter of the collapsing colonial system, but also the largest colonialist in the world today. The United States openly calls India's Goa and China's Macau "provinces" of Portugal, the United States supports Britain's suppression of the people of Cyprus and Kenya, and supports France's barbaric massacres in North Africa. While the United States is doing its best to support the colonial system, it is also doing everything possible to seize the colonies of other colonial countries and expand its own colonial rule. The United States has seized control of South Vietnam from France; grabbed part of the oil interests in the Middle East from Britain, and is further squeezing out these old colonial countries. The United States is also attempting to replace France, Belgium, and Portugal's colonial rule in Africa. It is obvious that the American colonialists are the most ferocious enemies of all oppressed peoples today.
    However, this struggling action of the colonial countries cannot save the fate of the colonial system, which is on the verge of collapse. The old forms of colonial enslavement such as using violent suppression have not only failed to frighten the people of the oppressed countries who have awakened and are fighting for independence, but have aroused even greater indignation among the people of these countries, who have risen up more resolutely and bravely to fight for national independence and freedom. The new forms of colonial enslavement, such as adopting "aid" to backward countries, are also doomed to failure. Many Asian and African countries now clearly realize that they must develop their own independent economies. For this purpose, they do not need to accept enslaving conditions and beg their former oppressors for enslaving "aid," they can obtain modern equipment from the Soviet Union and the people's democracies on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In the past two years, the trade relations between many Asian and African countries and the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democracies have developed unprecedentedly, and they have received economic and technical assistance without any political conditions attached, and have sent technicians to the Soviet Union to study advanced experience in industrial construction. This shows that backward countries are completely able to find ways to seek real assistance to industrialize their countries.
    The historical process of the 20th century shows that the disintegration of the imperialist colonial system is accelerating. All people who wish to safeguard national independence and oppressed people should further unite, repel the colonialists' frantic struggle, and fight for the complete abolition of the ugly colonial system!

### 为彻底废除殖民主义制度而斗争

    为彻底废除殖民主义制度而斗争
    今天我们来纪念反对殖民制度斗争日，有着特别重要的意义。现在，坚决地为争取和维护民族独立和国家主权而进行斗争的人民，正在空前地团结起来，用不可阻挡的力量冲击着殖民主义制度；帝国主义殖民体系正在解体。正像赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上的报告中所指出的：可耻的殖民主义制度的彻底废除现在已经作为一个最尖锐、最迫切的问题被提到议事日程上来了。
    殖民主义制度是阻挡人类历史发展的一个严重障碍，它使许多国家人民长期陷于无权和贫穷落后的境地。这些国家的人民为争取自由独立，摆脱殖民奴役的枷锁，一直进行着英勇不屈的斗争。但是，只有在伟大的十月革命的影响下，殖民地和半殖民地人民的民族解放运动才特别强有力地发展起来，使整个帝国主义殖民体系遭遇深刻的危机。中国人民革命的伟大胜利，再一次给予殖民主义制度以沉重打击，大大地鼓舞了世界各被压迫国家人民为争取自由独立而斗争的胜利信心和勇气。
    现在，世界各被压迫国家人民正在经历一个伟大的民族复兴的过程。亚洲的历史面貌已经发生了根本的变化。印度共和国已经作为一个大国而出现在世界的政治舞台上。缅甸、印度尼西亚、阿富汗、叙利亚、尼泊尔和其他一些以前的殖民地国家，都已经走上了独立发展的道路。还有许多亚洲国家的人民正在为争取自由独立而坚决斗争。在一向被看成“黑暗的非洲”，埃及和苏丹人民也取得了独立，阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯、怯尼亚、罗得西亚和非洲其他许多国家的人民已经觉醒，他们反抗殖民主义压迫的英勇斗争震动了全世界。在拉丁美洲，巴西、智利和其他国家，民族解放运动也正在发展，以致殖民主义者不得不经常采取策动政变和武装干涉的横暴手段来压制这些国家的人民。
    1955年4月在万隆举行的亚非会议，表示了亚非国家要求彻底废除殖民制度以及坚决维护民族独立和国家主权的决心。由于亚非会议的召开而产生的万隆精神，在第十届联合国大会上也有了鲜明的反映。在这个大会上，亚非国家的代表尖锐地谴责了殖民主义。
    但是，殖民国家不甘心于自己的失败。它们正在百般挣扎，力图保持残存的殖民地，并且把那些已经走上独立发展道路的国家重新放在它们的黑暗统治之下。美国侵略集团在各国人民争取独立运动空前高涨的情况下，除了继续使用挑拨离间的伎俩和血腥的暴力手段以外，还在采用所谓对落后国家的“援助”和组织军事集团等新的形式，企图恢复和保持它的殖民统治。美国向一些亚非国家提出的所谓军事和经济“援助”的建议，都附有强制性的政治条件，这就是干涉这些国家的内政，强迫它们提供军事基地和参加侵略性的军事集团。东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约等军事集团，就是作为对亚非国家人民实行殖民奴役的新方式而建立起来的。美国对落后国家的所谓经济“援助”就是要阻挠这些国家的工业化，把它们变成美国的原料供应地和产品销售市场。许多亚非国家反对和拒绝参加军事集团，反对美“援”，就是为了保卫自己民族独立和反对殖民主义的奴役。
    事实愈来愈清楚地说明，美国侵略集团不但是正在崩溃的殖民制度的主要支持者，而且也是目前世界上最大的殖民主义者。美国把印度的果阿和中国的澳门公开说成是葡萄牙的“省”，美国支持英国镇压塞浦路斯和怯尼亚的人民，支持法国在北非的野蛮屠杀。美国在竭力支持殖民制度的同时，又千方百计地夺取其他殖民国家的殖民地，扩大它自己的殖民统治。美国已经从法国手里夺取了对南越的控制权；从英国手里攫取了中近东的石油利益的一部分，并且正在进一步地排挤这些老牌的殖民国家。美国还企图取代法国、比利时、葡萄牙在非洲的殖民地统治权。显而易见，美国殖民者是今天一切被压迫国家人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    但是，殖民国家的这种挣扎行动，是挽救不了濒于溃崩的殖民制度的命运的。使用暴力镇压等殖民主义奴役的旧形式，不但没有吓倒被压迫国家已经觉醒并正在进行独立斗争的人民，反而激起了这些国家人民的更大的义愤，更坚决和更勇敢地起来为民族独立和自由进行斗争。采取对落后国家“援助”的殖民主义奴役的新形式，也注定非失败不可。现在许多亚非国家清楚地认识到，它们一定要发展自己的独立经济。为了这个目的，它们用不着接受奴役性条件向它们以前的压迫者乞求奴役性的“援助”，它们可以在平等互利基础上从苏联和各人民民主国家得到现代化设备。这两年来，许多亚非国家同苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的贸易关系空前发展，得到了不附任何政治条件的经济和技术援助，派遣了技术人员到苏联学习进行工业建设的先进经验。这说明落后国家在寻求真正的援助来使国家工业化方面是完全有路可走的。
    二十世纪的历史进程表明，帝国主义殖民体系的瓦解正在加速发展中。一切愿望维护民族独立的人民和被压迫人民进一步团结起来，打退殖民主义的疯狂挣扎，为彻底废除丑恶的殖民主义制度而斗争！
