    Japanese People Join Hands with Asian and African People
    By Japanese Writer, De Yongzhi
    In our homeland, Japan, the people's desire and movement to break free from the control of American imperialism, strive for independence, and maintain peace are growing day by day. In fact, it cannot be otherwise. American long-range atomic rockets are creating craters on Mount Fuji. To accommodate jet bombers carrying atomic bombs, American military bases across the country are expanding airports, and towns and villages are being leveled. In Hiroshima and Nagasaki, even after 10 years, people are still dying from atomic diseases; even in 1956, two people have already died, and no one knows how many more will die in the future.
    On January 30th, in the Japanese Diet, Socialist Party member Jotaro Kawakami's interpellation speech to the Hatoyama Cabinet was the voice of the Japanese people. Kawakami pointed out in his speech that the Hatoyama Cabinet's attempt to revise the constitution to revive the emperor system, intensify rearmament, and obstruct the normalization of relations between Japan and China and Japan and the Soviet Union is acting as an agent for American war policies. The Japanese people are suffering because military expenditures account for the majority of the 1956 budget. The working people are suffering from heavy tax burdens, wage freezes, and layoffs due to the American "speed-up system," facing multiple disasters. Reductions in forest protection and water management expenses have led to barren mountains and neglected water conservancy; reductions in social insurance expenses have even thrown patients lying in hospitals out into the streets.
    However, the Japanese people will never act according to the intentions of the American warmongers to "use Asians to fight Asians." The song "March of the Independence Action Squad of the Japanese Nation" (note) written by national railway workers is not only sung by Communists; today, millions of people across the country have joined the "singing" movement, and farmers, students, and children are singing.
    The year before last, in December, I went to the Soviet Union to attend the Second All-Union Congress of Writers. I crossed the sea for the first time by plane and saw the continents of Asia and Africa, and I was moved. We Japanese people, living on an island nation, and under the rule of a rare feudal system, have had little contact with other ethnic groups. Unfortunately, when the poor Japanese people crossed the sea, they carried guns for the Japanese imperialists' war of aggression. Now, when our homeland is in crisis, there are many things we Japanese people should reflect on, but we first understand that it is the war forces headed by American imperialism that have plunged Japan into suffering, and also plunged the countries and nations of Asia and Africa into suffering. We Japanese people extend our hands to the people of all ethnic groups in Asia and Africa. If we, the people of all ethnic groups in Asia and Africa, join hands and act in unison to strive for peace and independence, then we will surely be able to defeat our common enemy.
    (Note) In 1949, when the Japanese National Railway Workers' Union conducted a strike struggle against the American occupiers and the Japanese traitorous government, a worker from the National Railway Engine Factory between Tokyo and Yokohama climbed onto a tall chimney, defending their raised red flag for a week. This song was written by him while defending the red flag.

    日本人民同亚非人民携起手来
    日本作家　德永直
    在我们的祖国日本，人民群众要求摆脱美帝国主义的控制、争取独立维护和平的愿望和运动正在一天天地高涨。事实上也不能不是这样。美国的长距离原子火箭炮，正在富士山上炸出弹坑。为了装载原子弹喷气轰炸机的需要，全国的美军基地正在扩充机场，市镇村庄正在遭到平毁。广岛长崎的人们，在已经过了10年的今天，仍然有人因为原子病症而在死亡；就是1956年，也已有两人死去了，至于今后还要有多少人死掉，那是谁也不知道的。
    1月30日，在日本国会，社会党议员河上丈太郎向鸠山内阁提出的质问演说，就是日本人民的声音。河上在演说中指出：鸠山内阁企图修改宪法以复活天皇制、加紧进行重整军备，阻挠日中、日苏邦交的正常化，是代行美国的战争政策。日本人民由于1956年度的预算中军事费用占了大部分而遭受着涂炭。劳动人民一方面苦于重税的盘剥，一方面又由于冻结工资，实行美国的“赶快制度”而遭到解雇，灾难重重。护林治水费用的削减，使得山林荒芜、水利失修；社会保险费用的削减，使得躺在医院中的病人也被抛到街头。
    但是，日本人民决不会照着美国战争贩子“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的意图去作的。高唱国营铁道工人所作“日本民族独立行动队之歌”（注），不仅是共产党人；今天，全国已经有好几百万人参加“歌声”运动，农民们、学生们、孩子们都在歌唱。
    前年12月我去苏联参加全苏作家第二次代表大会，坐着飞机头一次越过了大海，看到亚洲非洲的大陆，我感动了。我们日本人民，处于海中的岛国，而且处于世界上少有的封建制度的统治下，所以很少同其他民族接触。不幸的是，贫穷的日本人民越过大海的时候，是为日本帝国主义者的侵略战争而扛着枪去的。现在，当祖国处在危机之中，我们日本人民应该反省的事情固然很多，可是我们首先懂得了把我们日本陷于苦难中的，也就是把亚非各国、各民族陷于苦难中的以美帝国主义为首的战争势力。我们日本人民向亚非各族人民伸出手。我们亚非各族人民携起手来，为争取和平和独立而一致行动，那我们就一定能够打倒我们的共同敌人。
    （注）1949年，日本国营铁道工人工会向美国占领者和日本卖国政府进行罢工斗争的时候，东京横滨之间的国营铁道工机工厂的一个工人，爬到高高的大烟囱上，保卫着他们升起的红旗达一星期之久。这首歌就是他在保卫红旗的时候作成的。
