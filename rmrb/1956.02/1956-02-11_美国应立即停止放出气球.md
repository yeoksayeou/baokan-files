Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch via TASS: On February 9th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a press conference regarding the issue of American military organizations releasing balloons into Soviet airspace.

Before the start of the press conference, approximately 100 Soviet and foreign journalists gathered in the hall and courtyard of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to view the dozens of intercepted American balloon casings and various pieces of equipment on display there. The equipment all bore the names of American companies.

Ilyichev, Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pointed out at the press conference that the Soviet government had sent several notes to the U.S. government regarding the issue of American military agencies releasing balloons into Soviet airspace. However, American military organizations are increasingly releasing balloons from West Germany and American military bases located in countries bordering the Soviet Union.

According to American newspaper reports, the U.S. Air Force Command admitted to releasing 500 balloons equipped with special instruments in the past month. Each of these balloons intercepted within Soviet territory did not contain meteorological observation instruments, but only instruments for aerial photographic reconnaissance. Furthermore, American military organizations have also been continuously releasing balloons carrying anti-Soviet leaflets and propaganda books into Soviet airspace.

Ilyichev continued by saying that these actions by American military organizations can only be seen as an attempt to implement the "brink of war" policy, which has already been condemned by world public opinion. These actions are a violation of the inviolability of Soviet territory. They also violate universally recognized norms of international law.

Colonel Dalantsev, a Soviet technical expert, then spoke. He stated that each intercepted balloon consists of the following parts: a balloon filled with hydrogen; a camera with two objective lenses for aerial photography, attached to the balloon; and a radio technology device to ensure the balloon's flight path can be controlled from the ground, to maintain a certain flight altitude by dropping sandbags, to automatically operate the camera, and to drop instruments with parachutes upon reaching the end of the flight. The instrument's power reserves can ensure application during a flight of 7 to 10 days.

Dalantsev continued by saying that a cardboard with the word "Secret" written in English was found on the balloon camera container, and the cardboard contained installation materials explaining the radio equipment. This proves that the preparations for releasing the balloons were carried out secretly. Releasing the balloons and ensuring their flight requires the organization of extensive specialized agencies, which cannot be achieved by individuals or organizations alone.

Ilyichev and Dalantsev then answered many questions from reporters. In response to questions about the danger of the balloons, they pointed out that the balloons' flight poses a risk of collision with transport aircraft and passenger planes, which threatens the safety of human lives. The balloons may explode on landing. The heavy instruments may damage houses, telephone lines, and power lines, causing fires and endangering human lives. They also pointed out that the Soviet Union fully provides meteorological information to all countries in the world in accordance with international agreements. Therefore, the purpose of the U.S. releasing balloons is by no means for meteorological observation. In response to a question, Colonel Dalantsev also opened a long, wide piece of film found on a balloon. The film showed several sections of Soviet territory.

In response to reporters' questions about whether the Soviet Union could also release such balloons towards the United States or Western Europe, Ilyichev replied that current technology and climatic conditions would allow it.

Hungarian Government's Protest

On February 9th, Hungarian newspapers published a note of protest from the Hungarian government to the U.S. government, protesting the increasingly frequent and numerous balloons containing American-made instruments flying into Hungarian territory from West Germany.

The note pointed out that these balloons have caused a series of unfortunate accidents. Last year, a U.S. hydrogen-filled balloon caused a Hungarian plane to crash and the death of a pilot. On January 21st, due to balloons, two planes collided near the border of the Republic of Austria, killing a pilot. These balloons hinder air traffic and endanger the lives of Hungarian and foreign citizens on airplanes.

The Hungarian government demands that the U.S. government immediately take measures to stop releasing balloons, and the Hungarian government reserves the right to demand compensation for the losses caused by the release of balloons.

Romanian Government's Protest

The government of the Romanian People's Republic has lodged a protest note with the U.S. government. The note states that the balloons released by U.S. military agencies pose a serious threat to Romanian air transport, to the lives of passengers and pilots flying on domestic and international routes. At the same time, many unfortunate accidents have occurred due to the landing and explosion of balloons. Many people, including children, have been injured and burned.

The note emphasizes that the actions of the U.S. military agencies violate the sovereignty of the Romanian People's Republic and undermine the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, which the United States has signed. The Romanian government demands an immediate end to the release of balloons.

    美国应立即停止放出气球
    苏联外交部招待记者
    新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯：2月9日，苏联外交部就美国军事机构向苏联领空放气球一事举行了记者招待会。
    在招待会开始以前，大约100名苏联和其他国家的记者就聚集在外交部大厅和院子里参观那里展出的被截获的几十个美国气球的外壳和各种装备。装备上都有美国公司的名称。
    苏联外交部新闻司长伊利切夫在记者招待会上指出，苏联政府曾几次就美国军事机关向苏联领空放气球事照会美国政府。而美国军事机构却越来越多地从西德以及分布在与苏联接壤的一些国家境内的美国军事基地上放出气球。
    据美国报纸报道，美国空军司令部承认，在最近一个月中放出了装有特殊仪器的500只气球。在苏联境内截获的每一只这种气球上，都没有气象观察用的仪器，而只有用于空中摄影侦察的仪器。此外，美国军事机构还陆续向苏联领空放出装有敌视苏联的传单和宣传书籍的气球。
    伊利切夫接着说，美国军事机构的这种行动不能被看成是别的，而只能被看成是执行已经受到世界舆论谴责的“战争边缘”政策的企图。这种行动是对苏联领土不可侵犯性的破坏。它还违反了举世公认的国际法准则。
    苏联技术专家答兰操夫上校随后发言。他说，每只被截获的气球是由下列部分组成的：一只装有氢气的气球；气球上有一架有两个对物镜的空中摄影照像机，还有一部无线电技术装置，可以保证从地面上控制气球的飞行线路，保证用扔掉沙囊的办法维持一定的飞行高度，保证自动操纵照像机和到达飞行终点时投下带有降落伞的仪器。仪器的电源储量可以保证在7昼夜到10昼夜的飞行中应用。
    答兰操夫接着说，在气球照像机容器上发现有用英文字写着“秘密”字样的纸板，在纸板上写着说明无线电设备的安装材料。这就证明了：放送气球的准备工作是秘密地进行的。而放送气球和保证气球的飞行，需要组织广泛的专门机构，个别的人或者组织是不可能实现这种事情的。
    伊利切夫和答兰操夫接着回答了记者提出的许多问题。在回答气球的危险性时，他们指出，这种气球的飞行使得运输机和客机有同它们相撞的危险，这就威胁着人命的安全；气球降落，可能在地面上爆炸；沉重的仪器可能破坏房屋、电话线和电线，引起火灾和危害人命。他们还指出，苏联按照国际协定向世界各国充分提供苏联的气象情报，因此美国放送气球的目的决不是为了进行气象观察。答兰操夫上校在答复问题时还打开在一个气球上发现的又长又宽的胶片。在胶片上拍着苏联领土的若干地段。
    在回答记者问苏联是否也能向美国或西欧放出这种气球时，伊利切夫回答说，现有的技术和气候条件是容许这样做的。
    匈牙利政府的抗议
    2月9日，匈牙利报纸刊载了匈牙利政府向美国政府提出抗议的照会，抗议装有美国制造的仪器的气球越来越频繁、越来越多的从西德飞入匈牙利境内。
    照会指出，这些气球已经引起了一系列的不幸事故。去年一只装有氢气的美国气球曾引起一架匈牙利飞机的失事和一名飞行员的死亡。1月21日，由于气球的缘故，有两架飞机在靠近奥地利共和国边境的地方相撞，使一名飞行员死亡。这些气球妨碍了空中交通，并且使乘飞机的匈牙利公民和外国公民遭到生命危险。
    匈牙利政府要求美国政府立即采取措施停止放送气球，匈牙利政府保留要求赔偿因放送气球而遭到的损失的权利。
    罗马尼亚政府的抗议
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府向美国政府提出了一份抗议照会。照会说，美国军事机关放送的气球对罗马尼亚的空运、对在国内航线和国际航线上飞行的旅客和驾驶员的生命是一种严重威胁。同时，由于气球的降落和爆炸，发生了许多不幸的事故。很多人，包括小孩在内，已经被炸伤和烫伤。
    照会强调说，美国军事机关的行为侵犯了罗马尼亚人民共和国的主权，破坏了有美国签字的联合国宪章的基本原则。罗马尼亚政府要求立即停止放出气球。
