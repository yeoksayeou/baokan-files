Editorial: Improve Methods of Preferential Treatment for Military Families

    With the rapid development of socialist transformation in our country, especially the agricultural cooperation movement, the methods of preferential treatment for military families, especially in rural areas, must be changed to adapt to the changed objective situation.
    Land cultivation on behalf of military families is the most important method of preferential treatment work in rural areas, and it is the main form of assistance from the masses to the impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel who lack labor to overcome difficulties. Although the land cultivation system implemented in the past had some differences in various regions and periods, there was a common basic method, that is, the number of land cultivation labor days was determined according to the amount of labor and animal power required for land cultivation, and then labor was assigned for cultivation, or a portion of people contracted for cultivation. This method generally guaranteed the lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in the past. However, with the development of the cooperative movement, the objective conditions in rural areas have changed. The land cultivation method built on the basis of the individual agricultural economy can no longer meet the needs of the work.
    Since the vast majority of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel participate in agricultural production cooperatives, their land is now managed uniformly by the cooperative instead of being managed separately, and the land cultivation labor is no longer individual labor but collective labor. Therefore, it is no longer possible to continue using the old land cultivation methods of assigning labor for cultivation and contracting for land. Families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel should not participate in cooperatives on the one hand and keep their land outside the cooperative for cultivation on the other, and cooperatives should not individually extract people to manage small plots of land for families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. Some technical problems cannot be solved by the old land cultivation methods either. For example, after families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel participate in cooperatives, if the preferential treatment method of assessing land cultivation labor days according to the land and converting land cultivation labor days into work-points continues to be implemented, the inevitable result will be: the land of some families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel is farther and worse, and because it requires more labor, they are assessed more work-points, earn more income, and their living standards improve; the land of some families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel is closer and better, and because it requires less labor, they are assessed fewer work-points, earn less income, and their living standards decrease. This is obviously unreasonable. If the land cultivation labor days are converted into cash, there are often many difficulties in calculation because the conversion rate cannot be consistent with the cooperative's work-points.
    During the period of individual agricultural management, auxiliary labor could not undertake the task of land cultivation, and the land cultivation work had to be borne by a portion of people. After the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, the members engaged in collective labor within the cooperative, which made it possible to jointly undertake the task of land cultivation. Therefore, the practice in the past of having a portion of male labor bear the task of land cultivation should be changed.
    The masses have created new land cultivation methods. In 1955, Nanfeng Village Township in Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, abolished the old method of land cultivation and adopted a new method of preferential treatment for work-points by agricultural production cooperatives. The main content of this method is that families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel participating in cooperatives, according to the different circumstances of each person, assess the number of standard labor days they should work in a year in the spring (if the actual labor exceeds this number, they can earn more; if they do not work enough, the cooperative will not make up for it); if the income from the standard labor days plus their other fixed income and land dividend income (of course, advanced cooperatives do not have land dividend income) cannot reach the average income of cooperative members, the cooperative will use the method of subsidizing labor days to ensure that they reach the average income of general cooperative members. Due to the implementation of this method, not only were the above-mentioned series of practical problems solved, but also the enthusiasm of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel for production was enhanced, their living standards were improved, and the burden on the masses and the country was reduced. In the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative of this township, the number of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel enjoying land cultivation was 6 households and 11 people in both 1954 and 1955. Compared with 1954, the number of preferential treatment labor days decreased from 622 to 490 in 1955; the labor days of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel increased from 20 to 189; and the government's land cultivation subsidy for this township decreased from 301 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen to 198 yuan 4 jiao. The actual income of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel increased by about 5%. This method in Nanfeng Village Township has also been implemented in other places and has achieved the same results. Facts have proven that this is an advanced method that is adapted to the new situation and is worth promoting in areas where agricultural cooperation has been basically realized.
    Rural preferential treatment work also includes the work of distributing state subsidies to families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. In the past, subsidies were generally provided to the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel themselves; after families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel participate in cooperatives and become members of the cooperative collective, their difficulties in production no longer exist, and the cooperative understands and solves their difficulties in life most clearly and conveniently. Therefore, the issuance and use of subsidies can and should rely on and pass through agricultural production cooperatives in the future, and be concentratedly used to solve the difficulties of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in joining the cooperative share fund and their actual difficulties in life.
    The new tasks put forward by the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement to the work of preferential treatment in rural areas have not been clearly recognized by every cadre of the civil affairs department, and conservative ideas still exist seriously in many cadres of the civil affairs department. They regard some methods that can no longer adapt to the new situation and have been negated by actual life as unchangeable. The actual work is advancing by leaps and bounds, but these comrades do not promptly summarize the advanced working methods and advanced experiences generated under the new situation to promote the continuous advancement of the work. The method of preferential treatment for work-points has long been created and implemented by the masses and grassroots cadres in some areas, but it has not attracted the attention of the local civil affairs departments and has not been promoted and developed in a timely manner. The Zhongsu Friendship Collective Farm in Guancun Township, Lu'an County, decided to implement the method of preferential treatment for work-points for families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel in 1955, but it could not be implemented because it was opposed by some cadres. Isn't this conservatism at work?
    The conservative ideas of some people are also manifested in overestimating the masses' consciousness. Some places are preparing to abolish the method of having a few people bear the burden of land cultivation and change it to the common burden of all cooperative members in townships that have basically realized cooperation this year, which has been opposed by some cadres. They are afraid of causing dissatisfaction among those who were previously exempt from land cultivation service and are afraid of "damaging their enthusiasm for production." In fact, the masses have long understood the principle that "everyone is responsible for the work of preferential treatment." The masses, whose socialist consciousness has been greatly improved and whose living standards have been greatly improved, do not care about taking out a very small amount of their own interests to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel solve their difficulties. On the contrary, they regard these as their due obligations. Therefore, civil affairs departments in various places should go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, study the advanced methods of preferential treatment created by the masses, and promote them according to local conditions.
    Now, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has formulated the "Implementation Plan on the Army's Participation in and Support of the Agricultural Cooperative Movement and Agricultural Production," which will have a positive effect on the development of China's agricultural cooperative movement and agricultural production. In order to effectively implement this plan, the party organizations at all levels in the army should formulate specific implementation plans, and all soldiers should give full play to their socialist enthusiasm and resolutely implement it; at the same time, the party and government leading organs in various places should also use it to educate all farmers, especially all members of agricultural production cooperatives, so that everyone will love their army more and support and help their army in all aspects. In general areas, whether urban or rural, various measures should be taken seriously to do a good job in the work of preferential treatment, so that the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel and demobilized soldiers can smoothly solve various difficult problems in life and production, and give full play to their strength in the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of agricultural production. This is of great significance to China's socialist transformation and construction, and at the same time, it is also of great significance to consolidating the army and consolidating national defense.

    改善优抚工作方法
    随着我国社会主义改造特别是农业合作化运动的迅速发展，优抚工作特别是农村优抚工作的方法必须加以改变，才能适应变化了的客观情况。
    土地代耕是农村优抚工作的最重要方法，是群众帮助缺乏劳动力的贫困烈属、军属克服困难的主要形式。过去实行的代耕制度，尽管各个地区各个时期有些出入，但有一个基本方式是共同的，这就是按照代耕土地所需要的人工和畜工的数量，来确定代耕工的数量，然后派工耕种，或者由一部分人包耕。这种办法在过去曾一般地保证了烈属、军属的生活。但是，随着合作化运动的发展，农村客观条件发生了变化。建筑在个体农业经济基础上的代耕方式，现在已经不能适应工作的需要了。
    由于绝大多数烈属、军属参加农业生产合作社，他们的土地已经由合作社统一经营而不是单独经营，代耕的人已经不是单独劳动而是集体劳动，因此，沿用过去那种派工耕种和包耕土地的代耕办法已经不可能了。烈属、军属既不应该一面参加合作社，一面把自己的土地留在社外享受代耕，合作社也不应该单独抽出人去分散经营烈属、军属的小片土地。有一些技术性问题，用旧的代耕方式也已经不能解决。例如，烈属、军属参加合作社以后，如果继续实行按照土地评代耕工、又以代耕工折合劳动日的优待办法，必然产生这样的结果：一部分烈属、军属的土地较远较坏，因为需要的劳动力多，因而评工多，收入多，生活有所提高；一部分烈属、军属的土地较近较好，因为需要的劳动力少，评工少，收入少，生活水平降低。这显然是不合理的。如果把代耕工折价，又常常因为同合作社劳动日折价不能一致，在计算上发生许多困难。
    在农业个体经营的时候，辅助劳动力不可能担负土地代耕任务，代耕工作只得由一部分人负担。农业生产合作社成立以后，社员在社内进行集体劳动，这就有了共同担负代耕任务的可能。因此，过去由一部分男劳动力担负代耕任务的作法，应该有所改变。
    群众已经创造了新的代耕办法。山西省潞安县南冯村乡在1955年取消了代耕的旧办法，而采取了由农业生产合作社优待劳动日的新办法。这个办法的主要内容是，参加合作社的烈属、军属，按照每个人的不同情况，在春季评定一年内应作的标准劳动日数字（实际劳动超过这个数字的，可以多得；没有做够这个数字的，合作社也不补）；标准劳动日收入加上他们的其他固定收入以及土地分红收入（高级社当然没有土地分红），如果不能达到社员的平均收入，就由合作社用补助劳动日的办法，保证他们达到一般社员群众的平均收入。由于实行这种办法，不但解决了上述一系列实际问题，而且烈属、军属的生产积极性提高了，生活改善了，群众和国家的负担也减轻了。这个乡的曙光农业生产合作社在1954年和1955年享受代耕的烈属、军属都是6户11人。1955年同1954年比较，优待工由622个减少到490个；烈属、军属的劳动日由20个增加到189个；政府给这个乡的代耕补助费由301元7角5分减少到198元4角。烈属、军属实际收入增加5％左右。南冯村乡这种办法在其他地方也有实行的，收到同样的效果。事实证明，这是和新情况相适应的先进的方法，值得在基本上实现农业合作化的地区推广施行。
    农村优抚工作还包括发放国家对烈属、军属补助费的工作。补助费过去一般都是对烈属、军属本人进行补助；烈属、军属参加合作社以后，成为合作社集体中的一员，他们在生产上的困难已不存在，生活上的困难也是合作社了解得最清楚，解决最方便，因此，补助费的发放和使用，今后就可以而且应该依靠和通过农业生产合作社，集中地用来解决烈属、军属入社股份基金的困难和生活中的实际困难。
    农业合作化运动的迅速发展给农村优抚工作提出的新任务，并不是每一个民政部门的干部都已经有了清楚的认识，保守主义思想在民政部门的不少干部中还严重存在。他们把已经不能适应新情况的、被实际生活所否定了的一些办法看作不可改变的。实际工作在大踏步前进，这些同志却不去及时总结在新的情况之下产生的先进的工作方法和先进经验，以推动工作不断前进。优待劳动日的办法在某些地区早已由群众和基层干部创造实行，但是一直没有引起当地民政部门的重视和及早发扬。潞安县关村乡中苏友谊集体农庄在1955年曾决定实行对烈属、军属优待劳动日的办法，但是因为受到某些干部的反对竟然不能实行。这难道不是保守思想在作怪吗？
    有些人的保守思想还表现在过低估计群众觉悟上面。有些地方今年准备在已经基本上实现合作化的乡取消少数人负担代耕勤务，改由全体社员共同负担的办法，曾遭到某些干部的反对。他们唯恐引起过去免服代耕勤务的人的不满，害怕“损害他们的生产积极性”。其实，“优抚工作人人有责”的道理，群众是早就懂得的。社会主义觉悟已经大大提高、生活水平也已经大大提高的群众，并不计较拿出自己为数极少的一点利益去帮助烈属、军属解决困难，相反的，他们倒是把这些看成自己应尽的义务。因此，各地民政部门都应该深入实际，深入群众，研究群众已经创造的先进的优抚方法，因地制宜地加以推行。
    现在，中国人民解放军总政治部已经制定了“关于军队参加和支援农业合作化运动及农业生产的实施方案”，这对于我国农业合作化运动和农业生产的发展都将发生积极的作用。为了有效地贯彻实施这个方案，军队中各级党的组织应该订出具体执行的规划，全体军人都应当高度发挥社会主义的热情，坚决执行；同时各地党政领导机关也应当用它来教育全体农民，特别是全体农业生产合作社社员，使大家更加热爱自己的军队，从各方面支援和帮助自己的军队。在一般地区，无论城市或农村都应该认真地采取各种措施把优抚工作作好，使烈属、军属和复员军人都能顺利地解决生活上和生产上的各种困难问题，并且在农业社会主义改造和发展农业生产中发挥他们的全部力量。这对于我国社会主义改造和建设事业有重要意义，同时对于巩固部队和巩固国防也有重大的意义。
