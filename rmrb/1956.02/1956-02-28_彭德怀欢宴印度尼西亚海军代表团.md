Xinhua News Agency, February 27th—Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 27th to welcome Rear Admiral Subyakto, Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Navy, and his wife, as well as the Indonesian Naval Delegation visiting China.

Prior to the banquet, Marshal Peng Dehuai received Rear Admiral Subyakto and all members of the delegation.

Anwar Sani, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Indonesian Embassy in China, and military attachés and acting military attachés from various countries in China were also invited to the banquet.

At the beginning of the banquet, Marshal Peng Dehuai delivered a speech. He extended a warm welcome to the guests on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He spoke about the long-standing friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia, which has been further consolidated and developed in recent times. He then said that the people of our two countries deeply understand that the efforts to strive for peace are inseparable from the struggle to safeguard our national independence and unity. Our territory of Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and Indonesia's West Irian has not yet been recovered. The national sovereignty and territory of our two countries are still being infringed upon by colonialists, and the peace and security of our two countries are still being threatened. The people of our two countries are also continuing to wage unremitting struggles against colonialist aggression. This naturally deepens the mutual sympathy and concern between the people of our two countries.

Marshal Peng Dehuai added that we firmly believe that the visit of the Indonesian Naval Delegation to China will enhance mutual understanding between the armed forces of our two countries, thereby also contributing to further developing the traditional and profound friendship between the people of our two countries.

Rear Admiral Subyakto then spoke. He expressed his gratitude on behalf of all members of the delegation for the warm hospitality of the hosts. He said that the friendship between our two countries has a long history, and the series of friendly activities conducted between our two countries recently have promoted and deepened this friendship. He hoped that the delegation's visit to China "can further promote and deepen the friendship between the armed forces of our two countries."

Attending tonight's banquet were Fu Zuoyi and Long Yun, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council; Admiral Xiao Jingguang, Deputy Minister of National Defense and Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy; General Li Da, Deputy Minister of National Defense; Senior Generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Su Yu, General Li Kenong, General Gan Siqi, General Su Zhenhua, Air Force General Liu Yalou, Navy General Wang Hongkun, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Navy Lieutenant General Luo Shunchu, Navy Lieutenant General Zhou Xihan, Air Force Lieutenant General Wang Bingzhang, Lieutenant General Zheng Weishan, and other generals.
