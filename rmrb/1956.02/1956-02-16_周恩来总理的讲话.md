Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Your Royal Highness, Prince, Friends, Comrades!

Today, at this grand banquet, we warmly welcome His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanoukon, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the National Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, who have come to our country for a friendly visit. I would also like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and its people, to express our great respect to Prince Sihanouk, all members of the National Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and, through you, to the people of Cambodia.

As early as the 1954 Geneva Conference, the Chinese delegation had friendly contacts with the representatives of the Kingdom of Cambodia. In April 1955, during the Asian-African Conference, I had the honor of having cordial contact and friendly exchanges with Prince Sihanouk himself. These contacts and exchanges not only established personal friendships between our two delegations, but also laid the foundation for restoring and enhancing the friendly relations between China and Cambodia. We are particularly pleased and honored to be able to receive His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk in our capital, Beijing.

The peoples of China and Cambodia have a long history of friendship. As early as over a thousand years ago, we had already established close economic and cultural ties. The Chinese people have always regarded the Cambodian people as brothers and Cambodia as a close neighbor. It was only due to the invasion of Western colonialists in the last hundred years that the friendly exchanges and kinship between our two peoples were artificially obstructed. However, our similar circumstances under colonial oppression and our struggles for national independence have further deepened the mutual sympathy and care between our two peoples. Now that both our peoples have embarked on the road of independent development, our desire to restore and enhance close exchanges and friendly relations has become even more urgent.

Over the past two years, the relations between China and Cambodia have been newly developed on the basis of old friendship. The Chinese people have always sympathized with the Cambodian people's struggle for independence. The Chinese people fully respect the policy of peace and neutrality adopted by Cambodia in international relations. During the 1954 Geneva Conference, the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia declared its determination to maintain peace and neutrality. During the 1955 Asian-African Conference, the delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, led by Prince Sihanouk himself, clearly stated that Cambodia would always maintain neutrality and would not be used as a base for launching aggression.

In my contacts with Prince Sihanouk, I was deeply impressed by His Royal Highness's determination to safeguard Cambodia's independence and the peace of Indochina. After the national election in Cambodia in September 1955, Prince Sihanouk once again declared that no country would be allowed to establish military bases in Cambodia and that no military treaties would be signed. During his visit to Japan, His Royal Highness also stated that Cambodia would adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, would not participate in any military blocs, and would not accept any protection offered by the Manila Treaty Organization. Recently, during his visit to the Philippines, His Royal Highness reiterated the policy of adhering to neutrality and not participating in military blocs. Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality has won the respect of the vast majority of people and many countries in the world, and has enabled the Kingdom of Cambodia to play an increasingly important role in Asian affairs. This policy not only conforms to the interests of Cambodian national independence, but also benefits the peace of Indochina and Asia.

The Chinese people congratulate the Cambodian people on the achievements they have made on the road to independent development. The Chinese people are especially pleased to see that China and Cambodia are gradually developing friendly relations with each other. China has consistently adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in Sino-Cambodian relations and has faithfully abided by the provisions of the Geneva Accords. We are pleased to note that His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, representing the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, has repeatedly emphasized that China's attitude towards Cambodia is completely correct. We also welcome a cordial remark made by His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, namely, that Cambodia, with a population of 5 million, cannot reject the friendship of the 600 million Chinese people. As far as we are concerned, we have always believed that countries, regardless of their size, should treat each other as equals and respect each other. Therefore, we respect all countries that are willing to treat us as equals, and we always extend the hand of friendship to them first. We have always believed that no country should demand any privileges in its relations with other countries. China firmly opposes the policy of aggression and interference against other countries, and firmly believes that countries pursuing such policies are bound to fail.

There is no doubt that this friendly visit by the National Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia, headed by His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, will enhance the friendly relations between our two countries and strengthen our cooperation in the economic and cultural fields. We firmly believe that the ever-developing friendly and cooperative relations between China and Cambodia, based on the Bandung spirit, will not only become another example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, but will also help expand the area of peace in Asia and create conditions for the peaceful development of the countries concerned.

I propose,

For the friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia,

For the peace of Asia and the world,

For the health of His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit of the Kingdom of Cambodia,

Cheers!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的亲王殿下，朋友们，同志们！
    今天在这个盛大的宴会上，我们热烈地欢迎前来我国进行友好访问的柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国国家代表团。我愿趁这个机会，代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，向西哈努克亲王，柬埔寨王国国家代表团的全体团员，并且通过你们向柬埔寨人民表示极大的敬意。
    早在1954年的日内瓦会议上，中国代表团就曾经同柬埔寨王国的代表们进行了友好的接触。1955年4月，在亚非会议期间，我很荣幸地同西哈努克亲王本人作了亲切的接触和友好的来往。这些接触和来往不但建立了我们两国代表团之间的个人友谊，而且也为恢复和增进中柬两国之间的友好关系奠定了基础。我们现在能够在我国首都北京接待西哈努克亲王殿下，我们感到格外的愉快和荣幸。
    中柬两国人民有着悠久的友谊。还在一千多年以前，我们之间就已经建立了密切的经济和文化联系。中国人民一直把柬埔寨人民当作弟兄一般地看待，把柬埔寨看为亲密的邻邦。只是由于近百年来西方殖民主义者的侵入，我们两国人民间的友好来往和亲戚关系才遭到了人为的阻碍。但是，我们在殖民主义压迫下的类似处境和我们为争取和维护各自民族独立而进行的斗争，却更加加深了我们两国人民间的互相同情和关怀。现在，当我们两国人民都已经走上独立发展道路的时候，我们要求恢复和增进亲密来往和友好关系的愿望，就更加迫切。
    两年来，中柬两国的关系在旧日友谊的基础上已经获得了新的开展。中国人民一直同情柬埔寨人民争取独立的斗争。中国人民十分尊重柬埔寨在国际关系中所采取的和平中立政策。1954年日内瓦会议期间，柬埔寨王国政府就曾经声明，决心维护和平和中立。1955年亚非会议期间，由西哈努克亲王亲自率领的柬埔寨王国代表团更明确表示，柬埔寨将始终保持中立并且不被利用为发动侵略的基地。
    在我同西哈努克亲王的接触中，亲王殿下维护柬埔寨的独立和印度支那和平的决心给予我以深刻的印象。1955年9月，柬埔寨全国选举以后，西哈努克亲王又一次声明，不许任何一国在柬埔寨建立军事基地，不签订任何军事条约。亲王殿下在访问日本期间还表示，柬埔寨将恪守和平共处的五项原则，不参加任何军事集团，不接受马尼拉条约组织所提供的任何保护。最近，亲王殿下在访问菲律宾的时候，又重申遵守中立和不参加军事集团的政策。柬埔寨和平中立的政策获得了世界广大人民和许多国家的尊重，使柬埔寨王国在亚洲事务中起着越来越大的作用。这个政策不仅符合于柬埔寨民族独立的利益，而且是有利于印度支那和亚洲的和平的。
    中国人民庆贺柬埔寨人民在争取独立发展的道路上所取得的成就。中国人民尤其高兴地看到，中柬两国正在逐步发展彼此之间的友好联系。中国在中柬两国关系中一贯遵守着和平共处的五项原则，并且忠实地遵守日内瓦协议的各项规定。我们高兴地注意到，西哈努克亲王殿下代表柬埔寨王国政府一再地强调指出，中国对柬埔寨所采取的态度是完全正确的。我们也非常欢迎西哈努克亲王殿下说过的一句令人感到亲切的话，那就是，拥有500万人口的柬埔寨不能拒绝6万万中国人民的友谊。就我们来说，我们一贯认为，国家不分大小都应该平等相处，都应该互相尊重，因此，我们尊重一切愿意同我们平等相处的国家，并且总是首先向他们伸出友谊之手。我们一贯认为任何国家在对待其他国家的关系中都不应该要求任何特权，中国坚决反对对别的国家进行侵略和干涉的政策，而且深信，执行这种政策的国家是一定要失败的。
    毫无疑问，这次以西哈努克亲王殿下为首的柬埔寨王国国家代表团的友好访问，将会增进我们两国之间的友好关系，并且加强我们两国在经济和文化方面的合作。我们深信，中柬两国根据万隆精神而不断发展的友好合作关系，将不仅成为不同社会制度的国家和平共处的又一个范例，而且将有助于扩大亚洲的和平地区，为有关国家的和平发展创造条件。
    我建议，
    为中柬两国人民的友谊，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    为柬埔寨王国国王诺罗敦·苏拉玛里特陛下的健康，
    干杯！
