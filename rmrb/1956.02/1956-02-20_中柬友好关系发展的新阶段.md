    Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Cambodian Royal National Delegation he led have left Beijing for friendly visits to various parts of our country. Our Premier Zhou Enlai and Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk issued a joint statement on February 18 regarding the results of their talks. This definitively marks a new historical stage in the friendly relations between China and Cambodia.
    During Prince Sihanouk's visit to our country, he received a sincere and warm welcome from our government and people. Chairman Mao Zedong received Prince Sihanouk and other members of the Cambodian Royal National Delegation. Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai accepted the Grand Cross, the highest order of the Kingdom of Cambodia, presented by Cambodian King Norodom Suramarit. These profoundly demonstrate the close friendship between the people of China and Cambodia. In the future, the friendship and ties between the governments and peoples of China and Cambodia will surely develop and deepen under the guidance of the correct principles affirmed in the joint statement of the two governments.
    In the joint statement, the two governments affirmed that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should serve as an unwavering guideline for Sino-Cambodian relations, and that contacts and economic and cultural ties between the two countries should continue to be strengthened; both countries are determined to work together to promote peace and international cooperation in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions and declarations of the Asian-African Conference.
    The enhancement of friendly relations between China and Cambodia, and the consensus between the two countries on many issues of common concern, are very natural. Our two countries not only have a long history of brotherly friendship and cooperation, but also the people of both countries have sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle for their respective national independence. Both of our countries are peace-loving countries, and the people of both countries are peace-loving people who strive to consolidate peace. Prince Sihanouk said: "In the struggle for the freedom of all peoples and for international friendship and peace, the strength of a nation is not measured by its material resources, but by its moral qualities." The efforts of the Chinese and Cambodian peoples for peace and independence and freedom mark a new page in the history of our close friendship.
    Facts have proven that friendly relations built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are the most solid international relations and are beneficial to both parties. Our friendly relations with India, Burma, Indonesia, Egypt, Afghanistan, Nepal, and many other countries are based on such a reliable foundation. In particular, the strengthening of economic and cultural exchanges between each other has brought great benefits to all countries. For example, our trade relations with India and Burma have greatly developed. From January to October 1955, the total value of our exports to India increased by two and a half times compared to the same period in 1954, and the total value of imports from India increased by more than nine times. During the same period, the total value of our exports to Burma increased by twenty-two times, and the total value of imports increased by more than twenty-seven times. Our country purchased more than 90,000 bales of cotton from Egypt, while Egypt imported 60,000 tons of steel from China, which it needed for economic construction. These facts clearly show that the establishment and development of equal and mutually beneficial trade relations have had a positive impact on the economic life of all countries. The mutual visits of various cultural delegations and art troupes between our countries have played a very important role in promoting friendship between peoples and strengthening mutual understanding and trust between the people of all countries. The friendly and cooperative relationship between the Chinese people and the people of the Kingdom of Cambodia also has broad prospects. The principles stipulated in the joint statement of the Chinese and Cambodian governments lay the foundation for our two peoples to enhance friendly cooperation and strengthen economic and cultural ties.
    The joint statement of the Chinese and Cambodian governments and the strengthening of friendly cooperation between the two countries are important contributions to the cause of maintaining peace in Asia. It not only serves as another example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, but also powerfully demonstrates that the power of Asian countries and peoples demanding peace and strengthening international cooperation is irresistible. Now, the countries and peoples of Asia are increasingly determined to demand peace and oppose war, because they increasingly clearly see that peace is beneficial to everyone, and war is detrimental to everyone. The Chinese people cherish the friendly relations with the Cambodian people and will do their utmost to enhance friendly exchanges between the two countries and strengthen the unity and cooperation between the two peoples, so as to jointly make new contributions to expanding and consolidating peace in Asia.

    中柬友好关系发展的新阶段
    柬埔寨王国首相诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和他所率领的柬埔寨王国国家代表团，已经离开北京赴我国各地进行友好访问。我国总理周恩来和柬埔寨王国首相西哈努克亲王，在2月18日就会谈结果发表了联合声明。这肯定地标志着中柬两国之间的友好关系已经发展到一个新的历史阶段。
    西哈努克亲王在访问我国的过程中，受到我国政府和人民真诚的、热烈欢迎。毛泽东主席接见了西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国国家代表团的其他成员。毛泽东主席和周恩来总理接受了柬埔寨王国国王诺罗敦·苏拉玛里特赠予的柬埔寨王国最高勋章——大十字勋章。这些都十分深刻地表现了中柬两国人民之间的亲切友谊。今后中柬两国政府和人民之间的友谊和联系，在两国政府的联合声明中所肯定的正确原则的指导下，必将日益发展和加深。
    两国政府在联合声明中确认，和平共处五项原则应该作为指导中柬两国关系的坚定不移的方针，两国之间的接触和经济、文化方面的联系应该继续增进；两国并决心根据亚非会议决议和宣言的精神，为促进和平和国际间的合作而共同努力。
    中柬两国友好关系的增进以及两国在许多共同有关的问题上具有一致的见解，是非常自然的。我们两国不仅在历史上有着悠久的兄弟一样的友谊和合作，而且两国人民在争取各自的民族独立的斗争中也曾互相同情和支持。我们两国都是爱好和平的国家，两国人民都是爱好和平、努力为巩固和平而奋斗的人民。西哈努克亲王说：“在争取各国人民自由和国际友谊与和平的斗争中，国家的力量不是用它们的物质资源，而是用它们的道义品质来衡量的。”中柬两国人民为和平和独立自由而进行的努力，标志着我们的亲切友谊在历史上的新的一页。
    事实证明，建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的友好关系，是最巩固的国际关系，并且是对双方都有利的。我国同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、埃及、阿富汗、尼泊尔和其他许多国家的友好关系，就是建立在这样可靠的基础上。特别是互相之间经济和文化交流的加强，给各国带来了莫大的好处。例如我国同印度、缅甸的贸易关系，就有了很大的开展。1955年1月至10月，我国对印度的出口总值比1954年同一时期增加了两倍半，自印度的进口总值增加了九倍多。在同一个时期里，我国对缅甸的出口总值增加了二十二倍，进口总值增加了二十七倍多。我国购买了埃及9万多包棉花，而埃及则从中国输入了它进行经济建设所需要的6万吨钢材。这些事实清楚地表明，平等互利的贸易关系的建立和发展，对于各国的经济生活都产生了有利的影响。而我们各国之间各种文化代表团和艺术团体的互相访问，对于促进人民之间的友谊，加强各国人民之间的互相了解和信任，都起了非常重要的作用。中国人民和柬埔寨王国人民之间的友好合作关系，同样有着广阔的前途。中柬两国政府的联合声明中所规定的各项原则，奠定了我们两国人民增进友好合作和加强经济、文化方面联系的基础。
    中柬两国政府的联合声明和两国之间友好合作的加强，是对维护亚洲和平事业的重要贡献。它不仅成为不同社会制度的国家和平共处的又一个范例，而且有力地表示了亚洲国家人民要求和平和加强国际合作的力量是不可阻挡的。现在，亚洲的国家和人民越来越坚决地要求和平而反对战争，因为他们日益清楚地看到，和平对大家有利，战争对大家都不利。中国人民十分珍视同柬埔寨人民的友好关系，并将尽最大的努力来增进两国之间的友好往来，加强两国人民之间的团结合作，以便共同对扩大和巩固亚洲的和平作出新的贡献。
