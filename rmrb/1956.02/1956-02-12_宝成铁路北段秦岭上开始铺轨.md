Track laying on the northern section of the Baocheng Railway began south of Qingjiang River on the afternoon of February 8th. The railway climbs the steep Qinling Mountains at a gradient of 30 per mille. Here, the railway forms "double horseshoe", "light bulb" and "figure 8" shapes, and then passes through the Qinling Tunnel, which is more than 2,300 meters long, heading due south to connect with the southern section.

In January of this year, the workers and technicians fighting in the Qinling Mountains proposed that trains should pass through the Qinling Mountains by the "May 1st" Labor Day, completing the opening of the northern section of the Baocheng Railway. They braved the severe cold and actively carried out track laying preparations. Huang Li'an, an engineer in the Mechanical Section of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, created a simple track laying machine based on the characteristics of the Qinling mountainous area project, which increased work efficiency by more than double compared with manual track laying.

    宝成铁路北段秦岭上开始铺轨
    2月8日下午，宝成路北段从清姜河向南开始了铺轨工作。铁路以千分之三十的坡度爬上险峻的秦岭，在这里，铁路形成“双马蹄”形、“电灯泡”形和“8字”形，然后穿过2，300多公尺长的秦岭隧道，通向正南，和南段接轨。
    在今年1月份，战斗在秦岭的工人们和技术人员们，就提出在“五一”节让火车通过秦岭，完成宝成铁路北段的通车任务。他们冒着严寒，积极地进行铺轨准备工作。铁道部第六工程局机械科工程师黄栗庵根据秦岭山区工程的特点，创造了一架简易铺轨机，比用人工铺轨，提高工作效率一倍多。　　　（本报驻西安记者）
