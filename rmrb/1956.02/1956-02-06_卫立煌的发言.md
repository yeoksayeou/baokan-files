    Wei Lihuang's Speech
    Chairman, esteemed committee members, esteemed delegates:
    Today, I feel supremely honored, immeasurably delighted, and endlessly excited to speak from the platform of the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
    Since I distinguished right from wrong, pursued truth, and returned to the embrace of the motherland, Chairman Mao and all the leaders have shown me great kindness and concern, making me feel the warmth of a returning traveler. Now, the people of the motherland have given me profound trust, allowing me to participate in the Political Consultative Conference, which makes me even more grateful! Many earth-shattering reforms in the motherland over the past five or six years, such as the "Land Reform," the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, etc., unfortunately, I returned a bit late and could not participate to contribute my meager strength, which I regret. I can only study hard in theory and practice, but the more I learn, the more I realize my inadequacy. In the future, I will continue to strengthen my study of Marxist-Leninist theory, combined with various practical activities, so as not to betray the glorious trust and hope of the people of the motherland.
    I fully agree with and enthusiastically support the political report of Chairman Zhou Enlai and the reports of Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Dong Biwu, and Committee Member Chen Boda. Now, I would like to offer my understanding on the issue of liberating Taiwan. While the people of the motherland are enthusiastically building a socialist society and moving towards a prosperous and happy future, only the eight million compatriots in Taiwan are still living in dire straits, enduring poverty and servitude. The new China has long achieved true unification, unprecedented in history, yet only Taiwan is still occupied by American aggressive forces. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. Liberating Taiwan is a matter of course. Why has Taiwan not been liberated yet? On the one hand, it is because the American forces forcibly occupy Taiwan, using it as a military base. On the other hand, it is because the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan do not understand the policies of the Chinese government, harbor doubts and fears, and do not know what to do, so they can only rely on foreign forces to prolong their lives.
    Chairman Zhou, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, once again solemnly announces the lenient policy towards the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan, calling on the people on the mainland and the people in Taiwan to unite under the banner of patriotism and jointly resolve this issue that belongs to our internal affairs. The Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan can return to the mainland to visit relatives and friends, and can visit and study. As long as they are willing to take the path of peaceful liberation, no matter who they are or how many crimes they have committed in the past, the Chinese people will treat them leniently and not hold their past deeds against them. That is to say, anyone who suddenly becomes aware is allowed to return to the motherland, without being held accountable for past wrongdoings. What a great, benevolent, sincere, and clear call this is. This shows that China's internal affairs should be resolved peacefully by the Chinese people themselves, and no third party needs to or will be allowed to interfere. I deeply know that the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan also have patriotic hearts, and they are definitely unwilling to endure the rule of foreign forces. I think, being Chinese and compatriots, would anyone really abandon the bright road and betray their motherland and compatriots, clinging to foreign forces to the end and embarking on a dead end? This is unimaginable. Moreover, the current motherland is a strong and prosperous motherland, occupying a leading position in the international community. Every Chinese person is proud to be born in modern China. Don't the military and government personnel in Taiwan have the same feeling?
    Chairman Zhou pointed out that the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang have had two cooperative relationships. I personally participated in both of these. Most of the Kuomintang members in Taiwan also participated in them, and almost all of them participated in the second time, fighting side by side against imperialism. History has proven that the Communist Party members and Kuomintang members can cooperate on both domestic and foreign relations. The living reality of the motherland today further proves that all the enlightened Kuomintang members on the mainland, some participating in state secrets, some holding leading positions, and others holding other important positions, have all been properly arranged. The Communist Party of China means what it says, and the Kuomintang members in Taiwan can dispel their worries, ignite their patriotic enthusiasm, step forward as soon as possible, accept the great call of the people of the motherland, strive to embark on the path of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, establish meritorious service for the people of the motherland, return to the embrace of the motherland, and jointly strive for the cause of socialist construction. As Chairman Zhou pointed out, by doing so, they will not only make contributions to the motherland, but also contribute to the peace of Asia and the world. This is the bright new path that the military and government personnel in Taiwan should take today.
    I sincerely support the call for peaceful liberation of Taiwan put forward by Chairman Zhou. I am willing, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the education of the great and wise Chairman Mao, to dedicate all my remaining strength to the great cause of socialist construction of the motherland, and to contribute to the cause of liberating Taiwan in any way and completing the complete unification of China. I warmly hope that my old friends and old colleagues in Taiwan, who have shared hardships with me for decades, will change their minds as soon as possible, return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, return home as soon as possible to reunite with their families and friends, to enjoy the joy of family, let us unite under the banner of Mao Zedong, bury ourselves in building our ideal new country. Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!

    卫立煌的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位代表：
    今天我在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议的议席上发言，感到无上的光荣，无比的愉快和无穷的兴奋。
    我自辨明是非，追求真理，回到祖国怀抱，毛主席和各位首长对我十分亲切关怀，使我感到有如游子回家的温暖。现在祖国人民又给我深厚的信任，让我参加政治协商会议，更使我感激万分！祖国五、六年以来许多惊天动地的改革，如“土地改革”、“三反”“五反”运动等等，因为我回来晚了一些，未得参加贡献我些微力量，引为遗憾。我只有在理论和实践方面努力学习，可是越学习越觉着自己的不够。今后我更要不断加强学习马克思列宁主义理论，结合各种实践活动，以期不负祖国人民的光荣委托和希望。
    周恩来主席的政治报告和李济深、郭沫若、陈叔通、董必武各位副主席以及陈伯达委员的报告，我完全同意，并且热烈地拥护。现在只就解放台湾的问题提出我的一点领会。祖国人民正在热火朝天地建设社会主义社会，走向繁荣幸福的前途，只有台湾800万同胞还在水深火热之中，过着贫困奴役的生活。新中国早就实现了历史上从来未有的真正的统一，只有台湾还被美国侵略势力所盘踞。台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾，解放台湾是天经地义的。台湾为什么还没有解放，一方面是美国势力强占台湾，把它当作军事基地，另一方面是台湾国民党军政人员不了解中国政府的政策，心怀疑惧，莫知所从，只有依附外力，苟延残喘。
    周主席现在代表中国人民和中国政府，再一次地郑重宣布对待台湾国民党军政人员的宽大政策，号召大陆人民和台湾人民在爱国主义旗帜下团结起来，共同解决这个属于我国内部的事务。台湾的国民党军政人员可以回到大陆省亲访友，可以参观学习，只要愿走和平解放道路，不管任何人也不管过去犯过多大罪过，中国人民都将宽大对待，不咎既往。这就是说，任何人只要他幡然觉悟，就允许他回转祖国，不咎既往。这是多么伟大，多么仁厚，多么恳切，多么明确的号召。这说明了中国的内部事务，应由中国人民自己争取和平解决，用不着也决不允许任何第三者干涉。我深深知道，台湾的国民党军政人员也有爱国之心，他们决不甘心忍受外国势力的统治。我想同是中国人，同为中国同胞，当真有人放着光明大路不走，而竟背弃自己的祖国，背弃自己的同胞，依附外国势力到底，走上绝路吗？这是不可想像的。何况现在的祖国，是一个强大兴盛的祖国，在国际间处于头等的地位。每一个中国人正以生在现代的中国而自豪。台湾军政人员们难道没有同样的感觉吗？
    周主席指出，中国共产党和国民党有过两次合作的关系。这两次我都亲身参加过的。在台湾的国民党员也大都是参加过的，而且在第二次并肩作战共同反对帝国主义的斗争中，几乎是全都参加的。历史证明，共产党员和国民党员是可以在对内和对外的关系上合作的。目前祖国活生生的现实，更是证明凡在大陆上有觉悟的国民党员，有的参加国家机要，有的担任领导工作和其他重要工作，都得着适当的安排。中国共产党说一是一，说二是二，台湾的国民党员大可消除顾虑，激发爱国热忱，及早挺身而起，接受祖国人民的伟大号召，争取走上和平解放台湾的途径，为祖国人民建立功勋，回到祖国怀抱，共同为社会主义建设事业而奋斗。正如周主席所指出的，他们这样做，不仅对祖国立了功勋，而且对亚洲和世界的和平也作了贡献。这就是台湾军政人员今天应当走的光明新生的道路。
    我衷诚拥护周主席提出的和平解放台湾的号召，我愿在中国共产党的领导下和伟大英明毛主席的教育下，尽我余生的一切力量，贡献于祖国社会主义建设的伟大事业，贡献于用任何方式解放台湾完成中国完全统一的事业。我热望在台湾曾与我共过患难数十年的旧朋友们旧同僚们，早日回心转意，早日回到祖国怀抱来，早回家园与家人亲友早日团聚，以叙天伦之乐，让我们在毛泽东旗帜之下团结起来，埋头建设我们理想的新国家，中华人民共和国万岁！中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
