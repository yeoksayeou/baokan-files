Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors Treat Epidemic Japanese Encephalitis

Epidemic Japanese encephalitis is a highly infectious disease with a mortality rate of approximately 35% to 50%. Currently, Western medicine has no specific treatments or drugs for it, mainly focusing on active prevention. In the past two years, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Shijiazhuang have been treating epidemic Japanese encephalitis based on the medical heritage of the motherland, with a cure rate of over 90% and no sequelae. The health leadership department attaches great importance to this valuable experience, organizing Chinese and Western medicine doctors from various places to learn and vigorously promote it. Hospitals that have implemented the treatment of epidemic Japanese encephalitis by traditional Chinese medicine doctors have achieved extremely high efficacy. Under the unity of Chinese and Western medicine doctors, this experience is currently being promoted in depth.
