Guangdong Province Re-Revises Grain Production Increase Plan
Wu Erxiang

The Guangdong Provincial Grain Production Conference, held in early January, re-revised the original 1956 grain production plan based on the new situation of basically achieving semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization in Guangdong Province before this year's spring plowing. The province's total grain output for 1956 is required to increase by another 18.5% on the basis of more than 22 billion jin in 1955, that is, an increase of 4 billion jin. This is 1.2 billion jin higher than the original increase plan. Completing this plan will allow the province to achieve the grain production increase target for the last year of the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. The representatives attending from various regions believed that even more production could be achieved. Therefore, they also set increasing production by 5.6 billion jin as a goal to strive for.

The process of revising this plan was also a process of struggling against right-leaning conservative thought. Judging from the situation examined by representatives from various regions, right-leaning conservative thought is quite widespread among cadres in the agricultural sector. At this conference, many representatives believed that it would be very difficult to increase production by 2.8 billion jin this year, and that increasing production by 5.6 billion jin was completely impossible. When formulating plans, they tried their best to lower the targets. In fact, the masses in their localities had already solved many of the difficult problems they raised. However, they turned a blind eye to these advanced things.

In 1955, Guangdong's rural areas suffered from a drought and insect pests unseen in a century. However, not only did production not decrease that year, but it also increased slightly compared to 1954. At the same time, the province also saw the emergence of two "thousand-jin counties," 21 "thousand-jin districts," and 488 "thousand-jin townships." In the spring of 1955, only about 7% of farm households in the province participated in agricultural production cooperatives. Before this year's spring plowing, the province can basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization. However, many people do not see this biggest change. The masses have already achieved results in many things, but some leaders are still shouting "impossible." The province originally planned to dig 370,000 wells before the spring plowing in 1956. Now, the Yuexi area alone will dig 420,000. Henglan District in Zhongshan County originally planned to accumulate 1,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Within two months, the masses have accumulated an average of 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Zhuhai County was originally worried that it would be difficult to complete the winter plowing plan of 1,000 mu. Now, the winter plowing area has exceeded 10,000 mu. Farmers in Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula, which have always had extensive cultivation and relatively low yields, have also proposed striving to achieve a rice yield of 1,000 jin per mu this year. These facts show that the current leadership of agricultural production is far behind the development of the situation.

This conference, based on criticizing right-leaning conservative thought, tapped into the potential for increased production and found the key to increased production. The representatives further realized that it is entirely possible for Guangdong Province to complete the Five-Year Plan's grain production increase target one year ahead of schedule. Guangdong Province has many superior conditions, but the potential of the land has not been fully utilized, and many favorable conditions have not been fully utilized. Taking rice as an example, the yield per mu in high-yield areas has reached more than 1,000 jin, and even more than 2,000 jin, while the yield in low-yield areas is only about 200 jin, and the provincial average is only about 400 jin. The province currently has more than 56 million mu of cultivated land, of which at least 30 million mu can be used for winter planting. However, in 1955, only more than 14 million mu had been planted in winter. If the province fully utilizes 30 million mu of three-crop land, transforms 70% of low-yield land into high-yield land, converts seven to eight million mu of single-crop land into double-crop land, and converts 2.6 million mu of double-season intercropping land into double-season continuous cropping, the output can greatly exceed the original target. Guangdong also has a lot of wasteland. In the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island alone, more than 10 million mu of wasteland has been surveyed, which is also an important way to increase grain production.

In terms of cultivation techniques, many places practice extensive cultivation. In Yuexi, Hainan and other places, many places still use primitive methods of sowing and mixed sowing. Sowing means scattering seeds in uneven fields, without weeding or topdressing, and letting them grow naturally. Mixed sowing is to mix the seeds of the early and late crops for sowing and planting. At the summer harvest, the seedlings of the late crop are cut off together, and then they grow again to harvest the late rice. If sowing is changed to strip sowing or transplanting, each mu can increase production by at least 100 jin. If mixed sowing is changed to separate planting, each mu can increase production by 170 jin. At present, most areas of Guangdong are still using old-fashioned farm tools, the area for promoting improved varieties is very small, and the prevention and control of natural disasters is still very weak in many areas. There is still much to be done in these areas.

Guangdong Province has great potential for agricultural production, and there are many ways to increase production. Completing the task of increasing production is guaranteed. The question is whether the comrades in agricultural departments at all levels in the province can go deep into reality, rely on the masses, grasp the main keys to increasing production according to the agricultural season and characteristics of their region, summarize the advanced experience of the masses, provide specific leadership, and earnestly implement it.

### 广东省重新修改了粮食增产计划

    广东省重新修改了粮食增产计划
    吴尔祥
    1月初旬召开的广东省粮食生产会议，根据广东省今年春耕前基本实现半社会主义农业合作化的新形势，重新修改了原定的1956年粮食生产计划。全省1956年的粮食总产量，要求在1955年的220多亿斤的基础上再增产18.5％，即增产40亿斤。这比原订的增产计划提高了12亿斤。完成了这个计划，就可以提前一年达到第一个五年计划最后一年的粮食增产指标。各地到会的代表认为还可以再多增产一些。因此，又把增产56亿斤做为争取实现的目标。
    这次修订计划的过程，也就是同右倾保守思想作斗争的过程。从各地代表检查出来的情况看，在农业部门的干部中，右倾保守思想是相当普遍的。在这次会议上，有不少代表认为：今年增产28亿斤就很困难，增产56亿斤是根本办不到的。他们在制定计划的时候，尽量压低指标。实际上，他们所提出的许多困难问题，当地群众已经解决了。可是，他们对这些先进事物熟视无睹。
    1955年，广东农村遭受到百年少见的旱灾虫害，但是这一年不但没有减产，而且比1954年略有增产；同时，全省还出现了两个“千斤县”，21个“千斤区”，488个“千斤乡”。1955年春，全省参加农业生产合作社的农户只占7％左右；在今年春耕前，全省就可以基本上实现半社会主义农业合作化。可是，许多人看不到这个最大的变化。许多事情，群众已经做出了成绩，有些领导人员还在嚷“办不到”。全省原计划1956年春耕前打井37万个；现在，只是粤西区就要打42万个。中山县横栏区原订计划每亩积肥1，000斤；在两个月内，群众积肥平均每亩已经达到10，000斤。珠海县原来担心完成冬耕1，000亩的计划有困难；到现在冬耕面积已经超过了10，000亩。一向耕作粗放、产量比较低的海南岛和雷州半岛，农民也纷纷提出争取今年每亩水稻产量达到1，000斤。这些事实说明，目前农业生产的领导远远落后于形势的发展。
    这次会议，在批判了右倾保守思想的基础上，挖掘了增产潜力，寻找了增产关键。代表们进一步认识到，广东省提早一年完成五年计划的粮食增产指标是完全可能的。广东省有不少优越条件，但是现在土地潜力并没有充分发挥，许多有利条件也没有充分利用。以水稻来说，高产地区每亩产量已经达到千斤以上，甚至有达到2，000斤以上的，低产地区却只有200来斤，全省总平均也不过400来斤。全省现有耕地5，600多万亩，可以进行冬种的土地至少有3，000万亩；但是1955年已经实行冬种的不过1，400多万亩。全省如果把3，000万亩三造田加以充分利用，把70％的低产田改变成高产田，把七、八百万亩单造田变成双造，把260万亩双季间作田改为双季连作，产量就可以大大突破原定的指标。广东的荒地还很多，仅雷州半岛和海南岛上已经勘察了的荒地就有1，000多万亩，这也是增产粮食的重要门路。
    在耕作技术方面，许多地方耕作粗放。粤西、海南等地还有不少地方采用原始状态的撒种和混种的方法。撒种是把种籽撒在高低不平的田里，不除草，不追肥，让它自生自长。混种是把早晚两造种籽混合起来播种插植，夏收的时候连晚造的秧苗一起割掉，然后再长起来收晚稻。如果把撒种改为条播或插秧，每亩至少增产100斤，混种改为分植，每亩可以增产170斤。现在，广东大部地区还在使用旧式农具，良种推广的面积很小，不少地区对自然灾害的防治工作还很薄弱，这些方面都还大有可为。
    广东省的农业生产潜力很大，增产门路也很多，完成增产任务是有保证的。问题就在于全省各级农业部门的同志们，能不能深入实际，依靠群众，根据本地区的农业季节和特点，抓住增产的主要关键，总结群众的先进经验，具体领导，切实贯彻实行。
