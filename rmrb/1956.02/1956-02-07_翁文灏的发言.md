    Weng Wenhao's Speech
    I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. As an intellectual who transitioned from the old China to the new era, I felt encouraged and uplifted upon reading Chairman Zhou's report on intellectuals and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's supplementary report, and considering the earnest concern and care from the Party and the government. However, having personally suffered from the direct poisoning of the reactionary politics of old China, I feel unusually vigilant in examining whether I myself am still stagnating in the phase of a middle-of-the-road element.

    Someone like me, even if unable to immediately become a communist or socialist, should at least strive to be a progressive element. If one only knows to support the Communist Party and the People's Government while remaining politically and ideologically vague, passive, and unprogressive, that is very inappropriate and even carries the danger of further falling behind.

    In this great socialist upsurge where the working class, peasants, and laboring people have already entered, the fact that statistics show the number of middle-of-the-road elements is still equal to the number of progressive elements is shocking.

    I imagine that middle-of-the-road elements have several reasons for being politically passive. First, there's the purely technical viewpoint, especially prevalent among those engaged in natural sciences and engineering technology. They mistakenly believe that science and technology have no class character, so there's no need for political study to strengthen their work. In fact, simply recalling how science, culture, and production technology stagnated and deteriorated during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and comparing it with how they have been systematically and massively developed and prospered since liberation, it becomes clear the necessity of the Communist Party's leadership and the brightness of the socialist road. Those of us who personally suffered painful experiences in the old era should feel this difference even more deeply and thus strive to learn more diligently the political thought of the new era to correct our past mistakes. Second, they fail to deeply understand the policies of overthrowing the exploiting classes, liberating productive forces, and opposing colonialism to strive for national independence and therefore adopt a bystander attitude towards the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the world. They mistakenly believe that this battle between the two forces has nothing to do with them, regardless of who wins. This view is, of course, extremely absurd. There is absolutely no room for neutrality between socialism and imperialism, which is developed from capitalism. All of us Chinese people must sincerely oppose imperialism to embark on the great road of socialism; there is absolutely no room for hesitation.

    Last winter, when I inspected Shanxi Province, I personally witnessed the workers in factories striving to make progress. Not only did labor models achieve remarkable results, but the workers in a medium-sized factory proposed as many as several thousand rationalization proposals. I also personally witnessed the peasants in the countryside enthusiastically joining cooperatives, abandoning private land ownership, and developing collective thinking to work together and greatly increase production to respond to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Upon returning to Beijing, I also personally witnessed the entire industrial and commercial sectors implementing joint public-private ownership with joy and excitement to enter socialist society. Undoubtedly, the whole country is surging forward in such a high tide. Intellectuals, seeing the entire country actively prospering in this way, should reflect on themselves and immediately recognize their own responsibilities; there is absolutely no possibility of stagnation.

    To break free from the stage of stagnation and lack of progress in our thinking, we must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, raise our ideological awareness, and use dialectical materialism to eliminate subjective idealism. In addition to this, I would like to specifically propose several points that should be strengthened: First, we must overcome the prejudice of individual arrogance and respect collective work and a life of united progress. Individualism was excessively developed in the old Chinese literati ideology. Even the so-called "achieve success and benefit all under heaven, remain poor and cultivate one's own virtue" is also an expression of individualistic thought. We must contribute to society; there is no possibility of escaping society and cultivating one's own virtue alone. Second, we must overcome the psychology of underestimating politics and observing passively, and rouse ourselves to a spirit of responsibility and progress. Third, we must overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and enhance our determination to realize socialism as soon as possible. In this unprecedented era of great construction, to rapidly advance our great country of 600 million people from a state ravaged by imperialism and scattered and backward to an independent, prosperous, and strong socialist society, not only must the working class and peasants exert full effort, but intellectuals also bear particularly significant responsibilities. It is truly imperative to catch up quickly and strive for progress.

    Now I want to say a few words to the many former colleagues who remain in Taiwan. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, and Taiwan will surely be liberated. Premier Zhou Enlai loudly calls on you to arouse your patriotic conscience, suddenly realize your errors, and quickly return to the embrace of the motherland. "The past cannot be overtaken, but the future can still be pursued." To break away from the pseudo-small court under the wings of imperialism and liberate the territory of Taiwan through peaceful means is to perform meritorious service for the motherland and will surely be welcomed and rewarded by the motherland. You have no reason to hesitate and wait any longer; quickly rise up and perform meritorious service!

    翁文灏的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告。我自己是一个从旧中国进到新时代的知识分子，我看了周主席关于知识分子问题的报告和郭沫若副主席的补充报告，想到党和政府的殷切关怀和照顾，我感觉鼓舞和振奋。但我因曾亲受旧中国反动政治的直接毒害，返省自身是否还停滞在中间分子的阶段，我又感觉超于寻常的警惕。
    像我这样一个人，即使不能立即成为共产主义或者社会主义分子，至少应勉为一个进步分子。如果只知道拥护共产党和人民政府而在政治思想上还是模糊不清，消极不进，那是很不应该，而且还有更为落后的危险的。
    在这个工农劳动人民已经进入如此伟大的社会主义高潮中，而统计表明，中间分子的数量竟还多到同进步分子数量相等，这是一个惊人的事实。
    我推想中间分子对政治消极的理由是有好几种的。首先是纯粹技术观点，尤其是从事自然科学和工程技术的人容易抱有这种误解。他们以为科学技术是没有阶级性的，所以用不着政治学习以加强他们的工作力量。其实，只要追忆国民党反动政权时代的科学文化和生产技术是如何停滞破败，和解放以后如何有计划有步骤和有规模的发扬兴盛，两相比较，便显见共产党领导的必要和社会主义道路的光明。这种差别，我们曾在旧时代亲受痛苦经验的人应该更能深切感觉，因而向新时代的政治思想更为努力学习，以改正从前的错误。其次是因对打倒剥削阶级，解放生产能力和反对殖民主义以争取民族独立的政策，不能深切了解而引为自身的责任，因而对世界上社会主义和资本主义的斗争采取了旁观态度。他们误认为这两种力量龙争虎斗，不管鹿死谁手，与自身没有关系。这种见解当然是极端荒谬的。在社会主义和资本主义发展所成的帝国主义之间，丝毫没有中立的余地。我们全体中国人必须真诚反对帝国主义才能走上社会主义的大路，绝对不可徘徊观望。
    我在去年冬间往山西省内视察，亲见工厂内的劳工奋发有为。不但劳动模范卓有成绩，而且一个中型工厂的工人所提合理化建议能有几千件之多。又亲见乡村农民踊跃加入合作社，放弃土地私有权，发挥集体思想，要共同劳动，大量增加生产，以响应党和毛主席的领导。回到北京又亲见工商业全行业实行公私合营，欢欣鼓舞，以进入社会主义社会。无疑的，全国各地都正在如此澎湃前进的高潮中。知识分子眼见整个国家这样的积极奋兴，返躬自省，应当立刻见到自身所有的责任，绝对没有停滞不动的可能。
    我们要在思想上跳出停滞不进的阶段，自然要认真学习马克思列宁主义，提高思想觉悟，和用辩证唯物主义来消灭主观唯心观点。除此之外，我愿特为提出应当加强用力的几点：一是要克服个人自大的偏见，而尊重集体工作和团结进行的生活。旧中国士大夫思想中个人主义过分发达。就是所谓“达则兼善天下，穷则独善其身”，也是个人思想的表现。我们必须有贡献于社会，没有跳出社会独善其身的可能。二是要克服轻视政治和旁观消极的心理，而振起负责向前的精神。三是要克服右倾保守思想，而提高赶紧实现社会主义的决心。在这个空前盛大的建设时代，要把我们六亿人口的大国，从原受帝国主义摧残而涣散落后的状态，迅速推进到独立自主富强繁荣的社会主义社会，不但劳动工农必须充分用力，知识分子也负有特别重大的责任。急起直追，力求上进，真是刻不容缓的。
    现在我要对留在台湾的许多旧同事说几句话。中国人民决心要解放台湾，台湾是一定要得到解放的。周恩来总理大声呼唤你们激发爱国良心，幡然悔悟，快速回到祖国抱怀里来。“往者不可及，来者犹可追”。脱离帝国主义卵翼下的伪小朝廷，通过和平途径以解放台湾领土，就是对祖国立功，一定会受到祖国的欢迎和奖励。你们没有再为迟疑观望的理由，快些奋起立功吧！
