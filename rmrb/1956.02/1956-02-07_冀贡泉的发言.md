Comrade Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:

I wholeheartedly support Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, and I also wholeheartedly support the various reports of other comrades.

I am a person who was transformed from an old intellectual, and I am already 75 years old. The older a person gets, the more years they have lived in the old society, and the heavier the burden they carry. Take me for example, I studied in school during the Qing Dynasty and was influenced by feudal education. I studied in Japan and absorbed some incomplete and patched-up old democratic ideas. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I directly came into contact with some misleading Western false democratic ideas in Europe and the United States. I studied law and my mind was filled with the bourgeois legal system predicated on private property as the major premise. I also spent more than a decade in the muck of the education circles and officialdom during the Kuomintang period, and I was stained with a lot of filth. Everyone knows that these heavy burdens are all stumbling blocks to progress. If it were not for Marxism-Leninism, this "bone-changing elixir," people like me would have been terminally ill and beyond salvation long ago. On this point alone, we should also kowtow to Chairman Mao, who called on us to study Marxism-Leninism well, saved us old intellectuals, and gave us the opportunity to start anew and work for the people.

So, have I studied Marxism-Leninism well? Has my thinking been transformed? Speaking of which, I am very ashamed. I am working hard to study Marxism-Leninism, but I cannot say that I have studied it well, so my thinking cannot be said to have been transformed well either, and therefore, my potential strength has not been fully utilized.

I really came into contact with Marxism-Leninism during the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the overseas Chinese community. I compiled daily newspapers related to democracy, resistance against Japan, and anti-fascism for many years. I first took a liking to the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman Mao's articles. At the same time, I also had professional and life-related relationships with some progressive comrades. At that time, according to the three interconnected paths mentioned by Chairman Zhou Enlai, everything was available, and it seemed that I could study hard and transform myself well once. But I, with my heavy burden, and with the sense of superiority of an old intellectual, only learned some superficial knowledge and was not able to go deep, and I ended up carrying a new burden, thinking I was progressive. In my work at the China University of Political Science and Law, and in the drafting of the Marriage Law, I had considerable opportunities to study in conjunction with my work, but when it came to self-education, I always felt it was still vague.

During the discussion of the draft Constitution, while working part-time in cultural and educational administration in Shanxi, I wrote a book to publicize and explain this great and glorious first people's constitution of the motherland to intellectuals of middle age and older. I thought that law was my major and profession, I had taught it for more than 30 years, and I had also written many lectures on law and ethics. I had also participated in several so-called constitutional drafts before liberation. Today, with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in the motherland, and with this people's constitution, the first effective constitution of China, it was my inescapable duty to write a book explaining and promoting it. After writing the first draft, I revised it again and again, but I always felt dissatisfied. The more I exchanged opinions with young comrades and experts, the more deeply I considered various revisions, and the more deeply I felt that my self-education was insufficient, and the more I regretted that I had not worked hard enough on ideological remolding. It is true, as a friend once said to me, that the more old things there are in one's mind, the less Marxism-Leninism can enter. There are too many old things in my ideology, so the new things feel insufficient. Some people say that I am old and do not need to work so hard. I do not accept that I am old. I believe that old age is not a disease. Many people who are older than me do more and better work than I do. Old age is also a kind of potential strength. One has more experience in life and work, and at least one has more targets for criticism in one's mind. The key issue is not old age, but whether one's self-education is good or not, and whether the depth of self-transformation is sufficient. When truly working, if the depth of transformation is not enough, one will encounter stumbling blocks, and one's potential strength will not be fully utilized.

The vast majority of intellectuals (including myself) have received great care, close attention, and love from the Party and the government in the past six years. After this conference, the working and living conditions that the Party and the government will give us will be even better than in the past six years. The tasks before us today are also very glorious and great. Who can not be invigorated, who can not be grateful and want to repay? Unless they are counter-revolutionaries, animals with not a drop of hot blood left. But how to repay? First of all, we must work harder on self-education and self-ideological remolding, and quickly liberate ourselves from old ideas! Give it special attention (I did not give it special attention in the past), this is the major premise for us to exert our potential strength.

I often say to my friends that the Communist Party is a collective sage, far greater than the solitary sage who "exercises caution when alone." But because of those residual burdens, I often find myself not progressive enough, and I feel that I am willing but not able, and I am afraid that I will be like the rabbit that Comrade Guo Moruo mentioned, falling asleep on the side of the road during the great march! Now I recall that if I had valued self-education earlier when I was working at the overseas Chinese newspaper, I would be one of the collective sages now! As for being old or not old, it really has no connection with self-education. Did the ancients not say, "If I hear the Dao in the morning, I can die in the evening"? Does Guo Moruo not say, "The work of self-education for intellectuals is endless"? He also said, "Intellectuals must have the tenacity to dedicate their entire lives to the cause of justice."

Living in an era of great socialist advancement, we should look forward, not backward. We should confidently shoulder the glorious tasks of this great era. Agricultural cooperativization, handicraft industrial cooperativization, and the overall joint operation of private industrial and commercial enterprises have all reached a climax, and we intellectuals should also have a climax of contributions to socialism. This is "not giving way when it comes to benevolence."

    冀贡泉的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我衷心拥护周恩来主席的政治报告，并衷心拥护其他各位的各项报告。
    我是由旧知识分子改造来的，已经75岁。人愈老，在旧社会生活的年代愈多，那就背的包袱愈重。像我吧，在清朝进过学，受过封建教育的影响；在日本留过学，吸收了些残缺不完、改梁换柱的旧民主思想；抗战期间，在欧美直接接触到些惑乱视听的西洋的假民主思想。我学的是法学，脑筋中装满了以私有财产为大前提的资产阶级法律制度。在国民党时期的教育界及官场的污泥中，也过了十几年，染上了不少的肮脏。这些沉重负担，大家知道，无一不是阻碍进步的绊脚石。假如不是有马克思列宁主义这付“换骨金丹”的话，像我这种人，早已病入膏肓，不可救药了。就这一点，我们也应当顶礼膜拜毛主席，他号召了我们好好地学习马克思列宁主义，拯救了我们旧知识分子，给了我们重新做人、为人民做事的机会。
    那么，我学习好马克思列宁主义了没有？我的思想改造了没有？说起来我很惭愧。马克思列宁主义，我是努力学习着，可是还不能说学好，因而我的思想也就不能说已经改造好，因而我的这点儿潜在力量，也还没有尽量的发挥。
    我真正接触马克思列宁主义，是在抗日期间，在海外华侨社会里边。我编写过好几年有关民主、抗日和反法西斯的日报。我初次看上了联共党史和毛主席的文章。同时也和些前进同志，有了业务、生活上的关系。那时候照周恩来主席所说的三个相互联系的途径，已经件件俱有，似乎可以好好学习，好好改造一次。但是包袱沉重的我，又加上旧知识分子的自我优越感，只学了些皮毛，没有能够深入，自己反而因此又背上一个新的、自命为进步的包袱。在中国政法大学的工作中，和在婚姻法的起草工作中，我结合业务，学习的机会相当有，但说到自我教育，总觉着仍是模糊。
    讨论宪法草案的时候，我在山西文教行政工作的业余，写了一本对中年以上的知识分子宣传讲解这部伟大辉煌的祖国第一部人民宪法的书。我以为法学是我的本行专业，我教授了30来年，还写了多少法律和论理学的讲义，解放前的所谓宪法起草，也参加过几次。今天好容易祖国有共产党、毛主席的领导，有了这部人民宪法，中国第一部生了效的宪法，我写一本解释宣传的书是责无旁贷的。写完初稿后，自己修改来修改去，总是觉得不满意。愈和青年同志专家交换意见，愈深入地考虑各种修改的意见，愈深刻地感觉到自己自我教育的不够，愈后悔我对思想改造的工作努力不够。诚然如一位朋友对我说过，脑筋中多一分旧东西，马克思列宁主义就少进一分。我思想意识中旧的太多了，因此新的就感到不够用了。有人说我老了，不必如此努力了。我不服老。我认为老不是病。很多年龄比我老的人，做的工作比我又多又好。老也是一种潜在力。生活和业务的经验都多些，至少脑筋中对批判的对象多些。关键问题不在老，而是在于自我教育的好不好，自我改造的深度够不够。真正工作的时候，如果改造的深度不够，就会遇上绊脚石，自己的潜在力就会得不到应有的发挥。
    绝大多数的知识分子（包括我在内）在过去六年中，受到了党和政府的伟大关怀和亲切照顾和爱护。经过这次会议后，党和政府给我们的工作和生活条件，比过去六年更要好。今天提在我们面前的任务，又是非常光荣伟大的。谁能不振奋，谁能不感激图报？除非是反革命分子，没有一点儿热血了的动物。但是如何报效呢？首先是要更加努力地自我教育，自我思想改造，赶快从旧思想中解放出来！把它特别予以重视（我过去就是因为没有把它特别重视），这是我们发挥潜在力的大前提。
    我常对朋友们说，共产党是集体圣贤，比“君子慎独”的单干圣贤伟大得多。但因为有那些残余包袱作祟，使我常发觉自己的不够进步，心有余而力不足，怕像了郭沫若副主席所说的兔子，在大进军的路旁睡了觉！我现在回忆我要早在侨报工作的时候，就重视了自我教育，现在也是集体圣贤中的一个！至于老与不老，确是与自我教育毫无联系之处的。古人不也说“朝闻道，夕死可矣”吗？郭沫若不说“知识分子的自我教育的工作是永远没有止境的”吗？他并且说，“知识分子必须具有为了正义事业献出整个生命的顽强性。”
    我们生活在社会主义大踏步前进的时代，更应当向前看，不要向后看。我们应当很有信心地担负起这伟大时代的光荣任务。农业合作化、手工业合作化、私营工商业全行合营等都到达了高潮，我们知识分子也应当有对于社会主义贡献的高潮。这是“当仁不让”的。
