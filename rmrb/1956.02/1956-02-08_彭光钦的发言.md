    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:
    I fully endorse the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders at the conference. I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the development of tropical resources in our country.
    In our socialist construction work, the development of tropical resources in South China is a major task.
    There are no fewer than 50 kinds of major tropical agricultural and forestry products, including rubber, one of the four major resources of modern industry, as well as sisal, Manila hemp, coconut, oil palm, hard gum, and shellac, which are raw materials for national defense and industry. There are also medicinal raw materials such as cinchona, cardamom, coca, and ipecac; tannin raw materials such as mangrove and catechu; popular beverages such as coffee and cocoa; and major spices such as pepper, citronella, rue, sandalwood, and so on. We already have seedlings for most of these major agricultural and forestry crops, and we can introduce the ones we don't have. These crops are all valuable, not only needed for our socialist construction, but also able to supply the needs of our fraternal countries in the peace and democracy camp. Therefore, the work of developing tropical resources has not only significant economic significance, but also significant political significance.
    The southern parts of Taiwan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces in our country, located south of the Tropic of Cancer, all belong to the tropics. In addition, the Yangtze River valley in southwestern Sichuan, due to its special topography, also has a subtropical climate. It is estimated that the developable area is about 100 million mu, of which about one-third can be used to develop tropical crops, about one-third can be used to develop tropical economic forest crops, and the remaining one-third can be used for general afforestation.
    We hope to fully develop all 50 major tropical crops within the next 12 years, and fully develop all 100 million mu of land. This will play a huge role in our socialist construction.
    However, the work of developing tropical resources is a new task, and we have very little foundation and experience. Therefore, it requires more coordination from scientific research work than other tasks. It requires concentrating scientific and technical personnel from geography, meteorology, soil, botany, ecology, physiology, pathology, entomology, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, chemical industry, and machinery to carry out professional and comprehensive research and production work.
    Many of our tropical areas are inhabited by minority ethnic groups, so it is particularly important for ethnic minorities to participate in this work.
    Many of our overseas Chinese in Nanyang have experience in managing tropical crops, so it is particularly important for overseas Chinese compatriots to participate in this work as well.
    Developing tropical resources is a new, great, and arduous task. We ask all relevant parties to pay attention to this work and give strong support and assistance so that we can quickly and well complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the Party and the state!

    彭光钦的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理和其他首长在大会上所作的报告。我想借这个机会来谈一谈关于开发我国热带资源的问题。
    在我们的社会主义建设工作中，开发华南热带资源是一项重大的工作。
    主要的热带农林产品不下50种，其中包括现代工业四大主要资源之一的橡胶，国防和工业原料的剑麻、蕉麻、椰子、油棕、硬胶、虫胶，医药原料的金鸡纳、玉豆蔲、古柯、吐根，鞣革原料的红树、儿茶，常用饮料的咖啡、可可，主要香料的胡椒、香茅、芸香、檀香等等。这些主要的农林作物，绝大部分我们都已经有了种苗，没有的我们也可能引种。这些作物都是贵重的作物，不但为我们的社会主义建设所需要，并且还可以供应我们和平民主阵营的兄弟国家的需要。所以开发热带资源的工作，不但具有重大的经济意义，同时也具有重大的政治意义。
    我国台湾、福建、广东、广西、云南五省的南部在北回归线以南的地区都属于热带，另外四川西南部的长江河谷地带，由于特殊地形的关系也有亚热带气候，估计可以开发的面积约有1万万亩，其中可以利用来发展热带农作物的约占三分之一，可以利用来发展热带经济林作物约占三分之一，其余三分之一可以进行一般的造林。
    我们希望在今后12年内把50种主要的热带作物全部发展起来，把这1万万亩的土地都全部开发起来。这样就会对于我们的社会主义建设起着巨大的作用。
    不过，关于开发热带资源的工作是一项新的工作，我们的基础和经验都很少，因此就比别的工作更需要科学研究工作的配合，需要集中地理、气象、土壤、植物、生态、生理、病理、昆虫、农业、林业、畜牧、水利、化工、机械各方面的科学技术人员来进行专业性的和综合性的研究工作和生产工作。
    我们的热带地区，很多是少数兄弟民族居住地区，因此就特别需要兄弟民族来参加这一项工作。
    我们在南洋各地的华侨，有不少是对于经营热带作物有经验的，因此也特别需要华侨同胞来参加这一项工作。
    开发热带资源是一项新的、伟大的、艰巨的工作，我们要求各有关方面重视这一项工作，予以大力的支持和援助，让我们能够很快地、很好地完成党和国家交付我们的光荣的任务！
