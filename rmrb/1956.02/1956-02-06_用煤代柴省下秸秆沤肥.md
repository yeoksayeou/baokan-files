Using coal instead of firewood saves straw for composting fertilizer.

The peasants of Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, will universally begin burning coal before the spring plowing this year, saving the crop stalks that were previously burned as firewood to make fertilizer.

Jieyu County is a cotton-producing area. With the gradual expansion of cotton fields and wheat replanting areas, the shortage of fertilizer has become prominent. Now that the agricultural cooperation movement in Jieyu County has greatly developed, and the living standards of the peasants have also improved, they have the conditions to change the habit of burning firewood. Therefore, the Jieyu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched a fuel reform movement for farm households in the county. After all the peasants in the county change from burning firewood to burning coal, they can save 80 million jin of cotton stalks and other crop stalks every year, and compost 1.5 million cartloads of fertilizer, increasing the average fertilizer application rate per mu of land in the county by more than double.

    用煤代柴省下秸秆沤肥
    山西省解虞县的农民，今年春耕以前将普遍开始烧煤，把过去当柴烧的庄稼的秆省下来做肥料。
    解虞县是个产棉区。随着棉田和小麦复种面积的逐渐扩大，就突出地感到肥料不够用了。现在解虞县的农业合作化运动有了很大的发展，农民的生活水平也提高了，有条件改变烧柴的习惯。这样，中共解虞县委会就在县里发动了一个农家燃料的改革运动。全县农民把烧柴改成烧煤以后，每年就可节省8，000万斤棉秸和其他的庄稼的秆，沤肥150万车，使全县每亩土地的平均施肥量增加一倍多。
