    A-re-cang's Speech
    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    This is my first time coming to the capital of the great motherland—Beijing—to participate in this meeting. At the meeting, I saw Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of all ethnic groups, and listened respectfully to Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of various leading comrades. I felt infinitely honored and excited.
    I am a Living Buddha of the Lamaist faith, wearing a yellow kasaya. In the years since liberation, my followers and I have deeply felt that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's policies of ethnic equality and unity, and freedom of religious belief, are like "Buddha's light shining everywhere" on the earth. They have enabled our ethnic minorities to stand up and have the guarantee of freedom of religious belief, which is truly indescribable in its gratitude. Now our country is carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation, so that people of all ethnic groups can live a more fulfilling life. Therefore, I very much agree with the statement of President Xiraojiacuo of the Buddhist Association of China, who compared socialism to the Western Paradise pursued by our Buddhism.
    The herdsmen and religious believers in our pastoral areas of Qinghai were deeply deceived and oppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, so they generally accept policies more slowly, and the consciousness of a few people is still not very high. Therefore, they have some doubts and concerns about taking the socialist road, more or less. The main concerns are: worrying that under socialism, "will religious belief still be as free as it is now?" "Will almsgiving be allowed, and will the lamas have food to eat?" Some people are also afraid that "if we take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, the property will no longer be our own," etc. Regarding their doubts and concerns, please allow me to say a few words in my religious capacity.
    As everyone knows, the Communist Party never tells lies or does false things. In particular, Chairman Mao once said to the Tibetan delegation that religious belief will always be free. The state has also provided legal guarantees for the policy of freedom of religious belief in the Constitution. What freedom is there not in religious belief and almsgiving! The Soviet Union is now a socialist society, and there are still many people who believe in religion. The state still respects religious believers and those who believe in religion, and protects all their legitimate rights. This is a powerful proof.
    Furthermore, socialism is like the Western Paradise. Everyone wants to live a more fulfilling and happy life. As long as we patriotic and law-abiding religious believers love socialism, love our own nation, and do more things in religion that are beneficial to our nation, we will gain greater faith from the people, and our personal lives will improve even more than they are now, along with the improvement of the people's lives.
    As for mutual aid and cooperation, I think this is a road to prosperity for everyone. Only by gradually taking this road can the herdsmen develop their cattle and sheep livestock faster, and our nation's poverty and backwardness can be completely changed. This sunny road must be taken. As for how to take it, we must study it carefully ourselves, and handle the problems in accordance with the country's policies and the principles of voluntary participation, as well as the specific conditions of our region. That is to say, you are free to join the cooperative, and you are also free not to join the cooperative, and you are still free to withdraw from the cooperative after joining. So, please don't worry about the issue of property rights.
    The above are my views. Please criticize and correct me if there are any inaccuracies. Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of all ethnic groups! Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups!

    阿热仓的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我首次来到伟大祖国的首都——北京，参加这次会议，会上我看到了各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席，敬听了周恩来主席的政治报告和各位首长的报告，使我感到无限的光荣和兴奋。
    我是一个穿黄袈裟的喇嘛教活佛，解放几年来，我和我的信徒，深深感到共产党和毛主席民族平等团结政策和宗教信仰自由政策，犹如“佛光普照”大地，使我们少数民族翻了身，有了宗教信仰自由的保障，真叫人有说不出的感激。现在我们的国家，又正在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，使各族人民过更美满的生活。因而，我很同意中国佛教协会喜饶嘉错会长把社会主义比作我们佛教所追求的极乐世界的说法。
    我们青海牧业地区的牧民和宗教信徒，由于过去受国民党反动派的欺骗压迫很深，一般接受政策较慢，有少数人的觉悟还很不高，因而对走社会主义道路，或多或少还有一些怀疑和顾虑。其中主要是：顾虑到了社会主义，“宗教是否还像现在一样有信仰自由”，“是否准化布施，喇嘛有无饭吃”，也有的人怕“走互助合作的路，财产不由自己了”等。对他们的这些怀疑顾虑，请让我以我的宗教身份说几句话。
    大家知道，共产党从来不说假话，不做假事。特别是毛主席曾经给西藏致敬团说过，宗教信仰，永远是自由的。国家在宪法中，又对宗教信仰自由政策，作了法律保障，宗教信仰和化布施还有什么不自由呢！苏联现在是社会主义社会，仍有许多人信仰宗教，国家对宗教信徒和信仰宗教的人，仍很尊重，并保护他们的一切合法权利，就是一个有力的证明。
    再说，社会主义犹如极乐世界，人人要过更加美满幸福的生活，我们爱国守法的宗教信徒，只要热爱社会主义，热爱自己的民族，在宗教上多作对自己民族有益的事，将会取得人民更大的信仰，个人的生活也就会跟着人民生活的提高，而比现在更好起来的。
    至于互助合作，我想这是一条大家富裕的道路，牧民群众也只有逐渐的走这条道路，牛羊牲畜才能更快的发展，我们的民族贫困落后状态，也才能够彻底的改变过来。这条阳光大道是要走的，至于如何走法，要我们自己很好研究，遵循国家的政策和自觉自愿的原则以及我们地区的具体情况来处理问题。这也就是说，你入社也有自由，不入社也有自由，入社后退社还有自由，那么也就请不要担心有无产权的问题了。
    以上是我的看法，不对的地方请大家批评指正。各民族人民的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！各民族大团结万万岁！
