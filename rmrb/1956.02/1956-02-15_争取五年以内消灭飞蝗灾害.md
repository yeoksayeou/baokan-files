    Strive to Eliminate Locust Plagues Within Five Years
    Ma Shijun, Associate Researcher, Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    The migratory locust is a historically significant pest worldwide, and many countries have suffered from locust plagues to varying degrees. In China, locust plagues have been recorded more than 800 times since the time of King Ping of Zhou, an average of once every two to three years. In the past, locust plagues were mentioned alongside floods and droughts as the three major disasters in Chinese history. In 1942, the area affected by migratory locusts in Henan Province alone was one and a half times the area affected in the year with the most migratory locusts after liberation.
    Since the national liberation, especially since 1951, the Communist Party and the People's Government have systematically led the broad masses to launch a comprehensive struggle to eliminate locust plagues. Over the past five years, we have progressed from fighting with "one old shoe sole in each hand" to widely using machinery such as automobiles and airplanes. Over the past five years, we have controlled locust plagues and fundamentally changed the living conditions of the people in areas affected by locusts in the past. The following figures and facts show the achievements of China's locust control in the past five years:
      (1) Area of incidence in previous years: Taking Hongze Lake, one of the bases of migratory locust outbreaks, as an example, if 1951 is set as 100, then 1952 is 82.96; 1953 is 70.25; 1954 is 31.64; 1955 saw a larger area of incidence than 1952 due to insufficient knowledge of locust conditions and the impact of the 1954 floods.
      (2) Density of incidence (this is the main standard determining the degree of damage to crops per unit area): If the density of migratory locusts in 1951 is set as 100, then 1952 is 65.38; 1953 is 2.31; 1954 is 0.46; 1955 is 0.038.
      (3) Type of migratory locust incidence (international entomologists use this as a sign to measure the prosperity or decline of migratory locust populations): In 1951, all migratory locusts occurring in the country were gregarious; in 1952, summer locusts were gregarious, and most autumn locusts were solitary; since 1953, most areas have been solitary, and only a few gregarious locusts have been found in individual areas.
      (4) Locust control costs and effectiveness: If the cost of locust control per mu in 1951 is set as 100, then 1952 is 31; 1953 is 10; after that, with the use of aircraft for locust control, it was reduced to 5.5 per mu. Before 1953, the mortality rate after aircraft control was about 80%; since 1954, it has reached 98% to 100%.
    There are three methods for controlling migratory locusts: chemical control, biological control, and transforming the outbreak bases. Using insecticides to control migratory locusts is the fastest way to achieve results after an outbreak. Biological control is the use of beneficial birds, beneficial insects, and bacteria to control migratory locusts. This method currently lacks the conditions for widespread application. Transforming the outbreak areas is a comprehensive measure to fundamentally eliminate locust plagues. Eliminating locust plagues cannot rely solely on one method and must be carried out in coordination in many ways.
    Regarding the general technical problems in the current locust control work, I would like to offer the following suggestions:
      (1) The issue of tools used in chemical control – the type of tool that is economical and effective should be determined by the geographical environment and economic conditions of the locust area. Airplanes are suitable for large grasslands and vast swamps; although some farmland and wasteland edges are not migratory locust outbreak bases, the ground is vast and there are few villages nearby, so airplanes should also be the main method. Power dusters and bait-spreading vehicles can be used in flat areas. For small areas of migratory locusts occurring in farmland or near farmland, hand-cranked dusters and sedan-style cloth bag dusters should be used to eliminate them on the spot in a timely manner. The highest standard for any insect control method should be "economical and effective." Therefore, future locust control should use all possible methods and tools under the principle of adapting to local conditions. Do not forget that our rural areas have huge labor potential, and do not ignore the new favorable conditions that rural cooperativization has added to insect control.
    (2) The issue of prevention and control density standards - high-density prevention and control, low-density no prevention and control, is the viewpoint of economic entomology. The reason is: after the pest density per unit area is reduced to a certain sparse number, it is not enough to cause economically significant damage, and the control effect is not significant after the number of insects is sparse. In the past, based on this point of view, a series of locust control standards were stipulated. Five years of locust control results have proved that this standard has indeed played a considerable role. With the standard, locust control work has changed from a chaotic situation to a planned and standardized control, thus saving a lot of manpower and material resources. However, it must be known that the reason why migratory locusts have become historically significant pests in the world, in addition to their strong adaptability and high fertility, is also because they have the habit of gathering and long-distance migration. Even though the density of residual locusts remaining after control is very small, they are likely to migrate together and cause disasters again in the next season. Therefore, the standard required for future locust control should be improved, requiring the locusts to be eliminated at the young age stage, so that they have no possibility of migration, and each area should be thoroughly eliminated. Achievements should be measured by the degree of eradication, and not only by the size of the area controlled.
    (3) Preventing and controlling migratory locusts requires farmers to cooperate and carry out overall planning for agricultural production. There are only two leading causes for the formation of locust areas in China: (1) disrepair of water conservancy; (2) unreasonable land use. As long as the natural features suitable for the occurrence of migratory locusts exist for one day, the threat of migratory locusts cannot be eradicated for one day. Reclaiming wasteland and building water conservancy projects in accordance with overall plans have a significant effect on eliminating locust plagues.
    (4) Fully grasping locust conditions is the key to successful locust control; therefore, establishing a reconnaissance system and conducting a series of locust condition reconnaissance is a regular task of locust control. The Soviet Union has not experienced migratory locust plagues since the end of World War II, but the locust control teams in Almaty and other places still conduct periodic locust area monitoring. In 1955, the area of migratory locusts occurring in China almost recovered to the scope of the year with the most migratory locusts after liberation, and individual areas even exceeded it. The main reason is that reconnaissance was neglected and locust conditions were not grasped.
    (5) Mechanical locust control is a highly technical task, and relevant departments should pay attention to the timely training and cultivation of locust control technicians. The use of power machinery for locust control and even its expansion to the entire agricultural production measures will be a direction for future agricultural development. Therefore, the cultivation of skilled mechanical technicians is not only for the present but also for the future. Scientific research is the basis for improving locust control technology. Now, provinces with locust areas across the country have generally set up locust control professional institutions - locust control stations. In order to improve locust control technology and solve general technical problems found in locust control in a timely manner, locust control stations should consider drawing a part of their strength to carry out some observations and research work closely related to locust control with the help of agricultural colleges or provincial agricultural science research institutes.
    Eliminating migratory locusts requires a comprehensive measure that combines politics and technology. Technically, highly scientific locust control machinery and pesticides can stop the occurrence of migratory locusts; overall planned water conservancy and agricultural measures can eradicate migratory locust outbreak bases. Politically, the gradual realization of agricultural cooperativization and the promotion of socialist education have greatly improved the production enthusiasm of farmers; the strong organizations at all levels established by the party and government’s emphasis also ensure the realization of effective technical measures. On the existing foundation, coupled with new industrial support and scientific research results that further grasp the laws of migratory locust outbreaks, we have the confidence to eliminate migratory locust plagues within five years.

    争取五年以内消灭飞蝗灾害
    中国科学院昆虫研究所副研究员　马世骏
    飞蝗是世界上有历史性的害虫，许多国家都曾在不同程度上遭受过飞蝗灾害。我国蝗虫灾害，自周平王时代有记载以来，两千多年间曾发生过800多次，平均每二至三年一次。在过去，蝗灾一直是和水灾、旱灾并提，成为我国历史上的三大灾害。1942年，只河南省一省发生飞蝗的面积就相当于解放后全国发生飞蝗最多的一年发生面积的一倍半。
    全国解放以后，特别是从1951年起，共产党和人民政府就有计划地领导广大群众全面地展开消灭蝗灾的斗争。五年来，我们从“一手一个旧鞋底”打起，发展到广泛使用汽车、飞机等机械。五年来，我们控制住了蝗灾，也根本改变了过去蝗虫为害地区群众的生活情况。从以下的数字和事实，可以看出五年来我国的治蝗成果：
      （1）历年发生面积：以飞蝗发生基地之一的洪泽湖为例，若定1951年为100，则1952年为82.96；1953年为70.25，1954年为31.64；1955年因掌握蝗情不够，并且受1954年大水影响，发生面积较1952年大。
      （2）发生密度（这是决定单位面积内农作物受害程度的主要标准）：若定1951 年飞蝗发生密度为100，则1952年为65.38；1953年为2.31；1954年为0.46；1955年为0.038。
      （3）飞蝗发生类型（国际昆虫学者把这作为衡量飞蝗种群盛衰程度的标志）：1951年全国发生的飞蝗都是群居型；1952年夏蝗是群居型，秋蝗多数是散居型；1953年以后绝大多数地区都是散居型，只在个别地区发现有少数群居型。
      （4）治蝗费用和效果：若定1951年每亩治蝗费用为100，则1952年为31；1953年为10；其后使用飞机治蝗，每亩降低到5.5。1953年以前，飞机防治后的死亡率是80％左右；1954年起，就达到了98％至100％。
    防治飞蝗的方法，有化学防治、生物防治和改造发生基地三种。利用杀虫药剂防治飞蝗，是在飞蝗发生后收效最快的一种方法。生物防治是利用益鸟、益虫和病菌防治飞蝗，这种方法在当前还缺少推广应用的条件。改造发生地是根本消灭飞蝗灾害的一种综合措施。消灭飞蝗灾害不能单独依靠一种办法，必须多方面配合进行。
    对于当前治蝗工作中一般性的技术问题，我提出以下几点意见：
      （一）进行化学防治的时候所使用的工具问题——使用哪种工具经济而有效，应以蝗区所在地的地理环境和经济条件为转移。大面积草滩和广阔沼泽地带宜使用飞机；有些农田和荒地的边缘地带虽不是飞蝗发生基地，但是地面辽阔，附近村庄稀少，也应该以使用飞机为主。地面平坦地区可使用动力喷粉器和撒饵汽车。对于发生在农田或农田附近地带的小面积飞蝗，则应该使用手摇喷粉器和轿式布袋撒粉器，及时就地消灭。采用任何治虫方法都要以“经济而有效”为最高的标准。因此，今后治蝗应该在因地制宜的原则下，使用一切我们可能使用的方法和工具，不要忘记我们农村中蕴藏着巨大的劳动潜力，不要忽视农村合作化后对治虫增加了新的有利条件。
    （二）防治密度标准问题——高密度进行防治，低密度勿须防治，这是经济昆虫学的观点。理由是：单位面积内害虫密度降低到一定的稀少数量后，不足造成有经济意义的损害，并且虫数稀少后防治效果不显著。过去，根据这个观点，规定了一系列的治蝗标准。五年来的治蝗结果证明，这项标准确实发挥了相当大的作用。有了标准以后，治蝗工作从乱打的局面变成有计划有标准的防治，因而少费了许多人力和物力。但是，要知道，飞蝗所以成为世界上具有历史性的害虫，除了它的适应力强和生殖力较大以外，还由于它具有聚集和远距迁飞的习性。尽管在防治后剩余的残蝗密度很小，但是它很可能迁聚在一起，为下一季再度造成灾害。因此，今后治蝗所要求的标准应当提高，要求把蝗虫消灭在幼龄阶段，不让它有迁移可能，并且要治一片就彻底消灭一片，要从肃清的程度上去衡量成绩，而不应只追求防治面积的大小。
    （三）防治飞蝗需要农民合作起来在农业生产的整体规划下进行。我国蝗区形成的主导原因只有两个：（1）水利失修；（2）不合理的土地利用。只要适合飞蝗发生的自然面貌存在一天，飞蝗的威胁就一天不能根除。按照整体规划开垦荒地和兴修水利，对于消灭蝗灾有重大的作用。
    （四）充分掌握蝗情是治蝗成功的关键；因此建立侦查制度，进行一系列的蝗情侦查，是治蝗的一项经常性的工作。苏联自第二次世界大战结束后一直没有闹过飞蝗灾害，但是阿拉木图等处的治蝗团依然按期进行蝗区监视工作。1955年我国飞蝗发生面积差不多恢复到解放后发生飞蝗最多的一年的范围，个别地区甚至还超过了，最主要的原因，就是忽视侦查，没有掌握住蝗情。
    （五）机械治蝗是一项需要高度技术的工作，有关部门应该注意治蝗技术人员的及时训练和培养。使用动力机械治蝗乃至扩大到整个农业生产措施上，将是今后农业发展的一个方向。因此，对熟练机械技术人员的培养不只是为了当前，也是为了将来。科学研究是提高治蝗技术的基础。现在全国有蝗区的省份已经普遍设有治蝗专业机构——蝗虫防治站。为了提高治蝗技术和及时地解决治蝗中所发现的一般性技术问题，蝗虫防治站应该考虑抽出一部分力量在农业院校或省农业科学研究所的帮助下进行一些同治蝗密切相关的观察和研究工作。
    消灭飞蝗要依靠政治和技术相结合的综合措施。在技术上，高度科学化的治蝗药械可以制止住飞蝗发生；整体规划的水利和农业措施，可以根除飞蝗发生基地。在政治上，农业合作化的逐步实现和社会主义教育的推行，大大提高了农民的生产积极性；由于各级党政重视所建立的层层负责的坚强组织，也保证了技术上的有效措施的实现。在已有的基础上，加上工业的新的支援，和进一步掌握飞蝗发生规律的科学研究成果，我们有信心在五年内消灭飞蝗灾害。
