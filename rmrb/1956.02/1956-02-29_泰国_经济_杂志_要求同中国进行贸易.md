Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, Bangkok: Thailand's "Economic" bi-monthly magazine published a statement on February 16th by parliamentarian Sai Marankan. He said, "I believe there are ample conditions for conducting trade with China. Our economic situation will improve as a result of trading with them."

The "Economic" bi-monthly also published an editorial titled "Trade with China is Thailand's Way Out." The editorial pointed out that the way to solve Thailand's economic crisis is to develop trade with Eastern countries, especially with China, on the basis of mutual benefit. At the same time, the result of Thailand's one-sided connection with Western markets clearly shows that Thailand's foreign trade will inevitably be at a disadvantage, and Thailand's various important commodities will inevitably be subject to unfair monopoly in terms of market and prices. The editorial said that the idea that Thailand's economy should only be linked to one side is no longer in line with the current situation. The editorial pointed out that therefore, the people of Thailand believe that developing trade with China is beneficial to the country. The editorial called on the Thai government not to ignore this demand of the Thai people.

    要求同中国进行贸易
    新华社27日讯　曼谷消息：泰国“经济”半月刊2月16日发表了议员沙茵·玛兰军的谈话。他说，我认为有各种充分条件可以同中国进行贸易。我们的经济状况将因同他们进行贸易而获得好转。
    “经济”半月刊还发表了题为“同中国贸易是泰国的出路”的社论。社论指出，解决泰国经济危机的途径是在互利基础上开展和东方国家，特别是和中国的贸易。同时，泰国片面同西方国家市场联系的结果也清楚地表明，泰国对外贸易一定会处于吃亏地位，泰国各种重要商品一定会在市场和价格上受到不公正的垄断。社论说，泰国经济只同单方面联系的想法已经不符合目前情况了。社论指出，因此泰国人民认为开展对中国的贸易是有利于国家的。社论要求泰国政府不要忽视泰国人民的这种要求。
