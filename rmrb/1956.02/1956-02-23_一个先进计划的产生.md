The emergence of any advanced thing will encounter some difficulties. The reason why advanced things are advanced lies in their courage to fight against various difficulties. The emergence of advanced plans is also the same. Advanced plans are not built on a foundation where everything is ready and there are no difficulties, but on a foundation of arduous work that ensures difficulties can be overcome. Therefore, the key to whether a plan is conservative or advanced lies in the attitude taken towards difficulties: are we intimidated by difficulties and shrink back, or do we face difficulties squarely and find ways to overcome them? The process of the Tianjin Power Machinery Factory formulating its production plan for this year demonstrates the struggle between this advanced thinking and conservative thinking. The same difficulties, viewed by the factory's Party organization and the masses of workers, were merely a matter of how to find ways to overcome them. However, viewed by the factory director, they became the basis for the production plan being impossible to improve. Because the Party organization resolutely fought against this conservative thinking and mobilized the broad masses of workers, it finally helped the factory director gradually overcome his conservative thinking and formulate a relatively advanced production plan, which increased the factory's planned output this year by one time compared to last year, and by 53% compared to the plan originally proposed by the factory.

In December 1955, when the 1956 national plan began to be formulated, the production plan proposed by the administrative leadership of the Power Machinery Factory was an increase of 30% over the 1955 output. The Party General Branch of the factory analyzed the plan from the following three aspects. First, the Power Machinery Factory is an expanding factory with great production potential and rapid production development. The output in 1953 and 1954 increased by more than one time each year, and the output in 1955 also increased by 72%. Why can't the output in 1956 be increased more, but only by 30%? Second, the increased production and thrift movement in the last five months of 1955 proved that there is great potential for increased production among the broad masses of workers. At that time, although a task equivalent to 20% of the annual plan was added, because the production enthusiasm of the workers was brought into full play, the rationalization proposals of the workers were adopted, and technical measures were improved, not only was the added task completed three days ahead of schedule, but the task was also overfulfilled. Why does the plan estimate this major factor of increased production to be only 2%? Third, the piece-rate wage system is an important measure to inspire workers' labor enthusiasm and increase labor productivity. According to the experience of other factories and the estimates in the plan, the implementation of the piece-rate wage system can increase production by more than 30%. Since the Power Machinery Factory decided to implement the piece-rate wage system in 1956, why should the implementation time be postponed to the second half of the year instead of being brought forward? Based on the above analysis, the Party General Branch believed that the production plan proposed by the factory was a conservative plan and must be revised. On the one hand, the factory director admitted that the plan's estimate of positive factors was conservative, but on the other hand, he emphasized that the factory had weak links and the plan could not be improved. Where are the weak links? It is the boring machine in the Second Machine Industry Department. This boring machine has indeed been used for a long time, its efficiency is very low, and its potential is very small, which cannot keep up with the need to produce more machines. The Party General Branch pointed out that the method of strengthening weak links must be used to improve the factory's production plan, and the entire factory must not be allowed to accommodate the weak links and lower the production plan. How to strengthen this weak link? The only way is to request the state to add a boring machine. At this time, the factory director raised two major difficulties: one is that the state may not approve the increase in equipment; and two, even if it is approved, it is difficult to buy this domestically rare machine. The Party General Branch believes that the state's requirements for enterprises are not only to increase production without increasing equipment. Since production cannot be increased without increasing the equipment of boring machines, and as long as two more machines are produced, a boring machine can be bought, how can the state not approve it? As for saying that even if it is approved, it may not be possible to buy it, it cannot be a reason not to improve the plan. Facts have proved that the state not only quickly approved the addition of a boring machine, but also quickly bought the machine.

How much should the plan be improved to not be conservative? The administrative leadership has no idea, and the Party General Branch has no idea either. Therefore, the Party General Branch, through the production capacity assessment work being carried out in the factory, assigned tasks to each branch, requiring each branch to go deep into the workshops, mobilize the masses, and do a good job in the production capacity assessment, so as to truly understand the potential strength of the production equipment as a basis for proposing the 1956 production plan. The results of the assessment showed that the production capacity of most workshops could be increased by more than 50% compared to last year, and the production capacity of some workshops could even exceed 75% of last year. At this time, the state proposed to the Power Machinery Factory that the output in 1956 should be increased by 55% compared to 1955. Based on the requirements put forward by the state, the results of the production capacity assessment, and other favorable factors, the Party General Branch, in coordination with the factory's administrative leadership, proposed a preliminary plan to increase production by 70% in 1956 compared to 1955, and conveyed the central government's instructions on completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it at the factory's worker's congress, and announced this plan to mobilize workers to discuss it. In order to ensure that this plan could be accepted by the masses, the Party General Branch launched extensive and in-depth ideological education work among all workers, inspiring and encouraging the masses to tap potential, find tricks, and formulate advanced production increase plans. At this time, the factory director emphasized new difficulties, believing that the foundry department is a difficult weak link to strengthen. The sand molds of this department are few and the furnaces are small. If they are not improved, it is indeed impossible to supply the blanks needed for the machines according to the plan. The Party organization especially strengthened the ideological education work of this workshop. The masses quickly put forward two measures to strengthen the weak link of the foundry department. One measure is to change sand molds to copper molds and change one mold one casting to one mold multiple castings, increasing efficiency by three to four times. The other measure is to use the method of crushing material blocks and adding oxygen to the furnace to speed up the melting speed of the furnace, from the original two and a half tons per hour to three and a half tons. In this way, not only can the supply of machine blanks in this plan be guaranteed, but it can also be greatly exceeded. In this discussion of the national plan, in just seven days, the factory's workers put forward more than 600 technical measures and rationalization proposals. Many measures and rationalization proposals can increase efficiency by one time, two times, or even three or four times. The original advanced individuals and groups put forward more advanced plans, and the original backward workers and groups also caught up. The socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers quickly threw the plan proposed by the leadership behind. Faced with this unprecedented upsurge of mass production enthusiasm, the administrative leadership and the Party organization showed completely different attitudes. The administrative leadership believed that although the political enthusiasm of the masses is valuable, it is not reliable and cannot be used solely as a basis for improving the plan; at the same time, it believed that if the plan is to be improved again, it will encounter insurmountable difficulties, because the Second Machine Industry Department has again appeared as a difficult weak link to strengthen. The Party organization believes that the political enthusiasm of the masses is not only valuable, but also reliable for ensuring the completion of the plan as long as the leadership is good at organizing and leading. As for the weak link of the Second Machine Industry Department, as long as the leadership is strengthened, it can still be overcome and cannot be used as an excuse not to improve the plan. The Party General Branch immediately concentrated its efforts to help and encourage this workshop to continue to tap its potential. Cha Yuhong, the director of the workshop, after a night of hard thinking, finally came up with a technical measure to improve the operation method of the gantry milling machine, increasing efficiency by one to two times. In addition, with the other technical measures and rationalization proposals of the workshop's workers, the guaranteed number of machine body processing in this workshop can be increased by one time compared to 1955.

Therefore, the Party General Branch proposed the requirement to increase the factory's total output in 1956 by one time compared to 1955.

This showed the factory director's conservative thinking again on the issue of technological transformation. The factory director believed that in order to complete the production task, which increased by one time compared to last year, it is necessary to postpone the trial production of new products and the make-up work of old products, because the factory director encountered new and huge difficulties, that is, the technical force could not keep up. The factory director even asked the Party General Branch to make a resolution to postpone the trial production of new products and the make-up work of old products, otherwise, he could not guarantee the completion of the production task that had increased by one time. The Party General Branch again criticized this erroneous thinking of trying to complete the production plan by postponing technological transformation. It pointed out that the country's socialist construction requires the Power Machinery Factory to trial-produce a 450-horsepower high-speed diesel engine this year, and at the same time, it also requires the Power Machinery Factory to improve the manufacturing of existing diesel engines and air compressors this year, so that costs can be further reduced and efficiency can be further improved. Therefore, the trial production of new products and the make-up work of old products are the country's urgent requirements for the Power Machinery Factory, and must be started immediately, and cannot be postponed under any circumstances. If the Party General Branch is to make a resolution, it can only make a resolution that both the completion of the production task that has increased by one time compared to last year must be guaranteed, and the trial production of new products and the make-up work of old products must be guaranteed to be realized on schedule, and not other resolutions. Is it difficult for the technical force to keep up? The Party organization analyzed it and affirmed that difficulties not only exist, but are also great. The difficulties occur in the construction section. The technical force of this section was originally insufficient, and the tasks have always been relatively heavy. It is already unable to complete the technical work of increasing output by one time, and the technical work tasks of trial production of new products and make-up work of old products are also very heavy. The trial production of new products requires the construction section to produce 500 sets of drawings, and the make-up work of old products requires the construction section to produce 2,000 sets of drawings. It is impossible to complete the task relying solely on the strength of this section itself. What to do? The Party organization is assisting the factory to find ways to solve this difficulty. First of all, technical personnel are being transferred from other sections to support the construction section. This month, five technical personnel have been transferred from the design section to help the construction section rush to draw drawings. Secondly, the factory's technical force is being rationally allocated. Some workshops have less technical work, but have too much technical force. Some technicians are actually doing the work of technicians. A part of these technicians and technicians can be transferred to strengthen the construction section. Furthermore, some workers above level 6 are transferred from the workshop to the construction section to serve as technicians, because there is not much work that requires workers above level 6 in the workshop. Taking out a part of them will not affect the production of the workshop, and can also train technical cadres and strengthen the technical force. Finally, selecting a part of the young apprentices and staff members with junior high school education from the factory for training can quickly become technicians. The person who is currently the leader of the tracing team in the construction section was a junior high school student 10 months ago. In this way, the problem of insufficient technical force can be completely solved.

Through this series of work by the Party organization, the conservative thinking of the factory's administrative leaders is gradually being overcome, the understanding is gradually being improved, and the confidence is also gradually being increased. After this plan was announced at the workers' congress on the 7th of this month, the factory's workers are carrying out socialist competition and working hard to complete this plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. However, the struggle between advanced thinking and conservative thinking in this factory cannot be considered to have ended. Can the factory's administrative leaders stand in front of the upsurge of mass production enthusiasm and boldly lead the masses forward? Can they no longer shrink back in the face of new difficulties? This depends on their actual actions.

    一个先进计划的产生
    黎言　启民
    任何先进事物的出现，都会碰到一些困难，先进事物之所以先进，就表现在它敢于同各种困难作斗争。先进计划的产生也是如此，先进计划不是建立在万事具备毫无困难的基础之上，而是建立在进行艰苦工作保证能够克服困难的基础之上。因此，计划究竟定得保守还是先进的关键就在于对待困难采取什么态度，是被困难所吓倒畏缩不前呢？还是正视困难并想办法战胜它呢？天津动力机器厂制定今年生产计划的过程，正表现了这种先进思想和保守思想的斗争。同样的困难，要让这个厂的党组织和职工群众来看，只是如何想办法去克服的问题，可是，要让这个厂的厂长来看，就成了生产计划无法提高的根据了。由于党组织坚决地同这种保守思想进行了斗争，发动了广大职工群众，终于帮助厂长逐步克服了保守思想，制定了比较先进的生产计划，使这个厂今年的计划产量较去年提高一倍，较厂方原来提出的计划提高53％。
    1955年12月间，当开始制定1956年国家计划的时候，动力机器厂行政领导上提出的生产计划是较1955年的产量提高30％。这个厂的党总支从以下三个方面对计划作了分析。第一，动力机器厂是个扩建中的工厂，生产潜力很大，生产发展很快。1953年和1954年的产量每年都要提高一倍以上，1955年的产量也提高了72％，为什么1956年的产量就不能提高得多一点，而只能提高30％呢？第二，1955年后五个月的增产节约运动证明，广大职工群众中有着很大的增产潜力，当时虽然追加了相当于全年计划的20％的任务，但是由于比较充分地发挥了职工的生产积极性，采纳了职工的合理化建议，改进了技术措施，不但提前三天完成了追加任务，还超额完成了任务。为什么计划方案中把这一增产的重大因素只估计可增产2％呢？第三，计件工资制是启发职工的劳动积极性提高劳动生产率的重要措施，根据其他工厂的经验和计划方案中的估计，实行计件工资制后，可以提高生产30％以上。动力机器厂既然决定在1956年实行计件工资制，为什么计划方案中要把实行的时间推迟到后半年而不提早一些呢？根据以上分析，党总支认为厂方提出的生产计划是一个保守的计划，必须加以修改。厂长一方面承认这个计划对积极因素的估计是保守的，但另一方面又强调厂里有薄弱环节，计划还是无法提高。薄弱环节在那里呢？就是第二机工部的镗床。这部镗床的确使用了很久，效率很低，潜力很小，赶不上生产更多机器的需要。党总支指出必须用加强薄弱环节的办法去提高全厂的生产计划，决不能让全厂去迁就薄弱环节而压低生产计划。如何加强这个薄弱环节呢？唯一办法是请求国家增加一部镗床的设备。这时厂长又提出了两大困难，一是国家不一定会批准增加设备；二是即使批准了也很难买到这种国内稀有的机器。党总支认为国家对企业的要求并不是只要求增加生产，不给增加设备。既然不增加镗床的设备就不能提高生产，而只要多生产两台机器就可以买一部镗床，国家怎么能不批准呢？至于说即使批准也可能买不到，更不能成为不去提高计划的理由。事实证明，增加一部镗床设备，国家不但很快批准了，而且机器也很快就买到了。
      究竟把计划提高到多少才不是保守的呢？行政领导上心中无数，党总支也心中无数。于是党总支就通过厂里正在进行的生产能力查定工作，向各个分支部布置了任务，要各个分支部深入车间，发动群众，做好生产能力查定工作，确实了解生产设备的潜在力量，作为提出1956年生产计划的一个根据。查定的结果表明，绝大部分车间的生产能力可以比去年提高50％以上，有的车间的生产能力甚至可以超过去年的75％。这时，国家向动力机器厂提出1956年要较1955年提高产量55％的要求。党总支根据国家提出的要求，根据生产能力查定的结果，以及根据其他有利因素，协同厂的行政领导上提出1956年较1955年增产70％的初步计划，并在全厂的职工群众大会上，传达了中央关于提前和超额完成五年计划的指示，宣布了这一计划，发动职工讨论。党总支为了保证这一计划能被群众接受，就在全体职工中展开了广泛深入的思想教育工作，启发和鼓励群众挖潜力，找窍门，制定先进的增产计划。这时，厂长又强调新的困难了，认为铸工部是一个很难加强的薄弱环节，这个部的沙型少，熔炉小，如果不加以改进，的确无法按照计划供应机器需要的毛坯。党组织就特别加强了对这个车间的思想教育工作。群众很快就提出了两项措施，加强了铸工部这个薄弱环节。一项措施是改沙模为铜模并改一模一铸为一模多铸，提高效率三倍到四倍。另一项措施是采用打碎料块和炉内加氧的办法，加快熔炉的熔炼速度，由原来每小时熔炼两吨半提高到三吨半。这样，不但可以保证这一计划中机器毛坯的供应，还可以大大超过。在这次讨论国家计划中，仅仅七天的时间全厂职工就提出了600多项技术措施和合理化建议，很多措施和合理化建议都可以提高效率一倍两倍以至三倍四倍。原来先进的个人和小组提出了更加先进的计划，原来落后的工人和小组也赶上来了。绝大部分车间的计划都超过了厂里的计划，绝大部分小组的计划又超过了车间的计划。广大职工的社会主义积极性很快就把领导上提出的计划抛到后面了。面对着这种空前高涨的群众性的生产热情，行政领导上和党组织又表现了截然不同的态度。行政领导上认为群众的政治热情虽然可贵，但并不可靠，不能仅仅根据这种热情去提高计划；同时认为如果再要提高计划，就要碰到无法克服的困难，因为第二机工部又出现了很难加强的薄弱环节。党组织则认为群众的政治热情不仅是可贵的，只要领导上善于组织和领导，对保证完成计划也是可靠的。至于第二机工部的薄弱环节，只要加强领导，仍然是可以克服的，不能作为不去提高计划的借口。党总支就立即集中力量帮助和鼓励这个车间继续挖掘潜力。车间主任查玉泓经过一夜苦思，终于想出了改进龙门铣操作方法的技术措施，提高效率一倍到两倍，加上车间群众的其他技术措施和合理化建议，这个车间加工机身的保证数字可以比1955年提高一倍。
    于是，党总支就提出1956年的全厂总产量比1955年提高一倍的要求。
    这对厂长的保守思想又在技术改革问题上表现出来了。厂长认为既要完成较去年增加一倍的生产任务，就必须推迟新产品试制和老产品的补课工作，因为，厂长又碰到了新的巨大困难，这就是技术力量赶不上去。厂长甚至要求党总支作出推迟新产品试制和老产品补课工作的决议，否则，他就不能保证增加了一倍的生产任务的完成。党总支又批判了这种企图用推迟技术改革来完成生产计划的错误思想。指出国家的社会主义建设要求动力机器厂今年一定要试制出450马力的高速柴油机，同时，也要求动力机器厂今年一定要改进原有柴油机和空气压缩机的制造，使成本进一步降低，效率进一步提高。因此，新产品试制和老产品补课是国家对动力机器厂的迫切要求，必须马上着手进行，无论如何不能推后。如果要党总支作决议的话，只能作出既要保证较去年增加一倍的生产任务的完成，又要保证新产品试制和老产品补课如期实现的决议，而不是其他决议。技术力量要赶上去是不是有困难呢？党组织作了分析，肯定困难不仅有，而且很大，困难就发生在施工科。这个科的技术力量本来不足，任务一向比较繁重，要完成产量提高一倍的技术工作已经力不胜任，而新产品试制和老产品补课的技术工作任务又很繁重，新产品试制需要施工科出500套图纸，老产品补课又需要施工科出2，000套图纸。仅仅靠这个科本身的力量是无论如何也完不成任务的。怎么办呢？党组织正在协助厂方设法解决这个困难。首先，是从其他科室中抽调技术人员支援施工科。本月已经从设计科抽调了五个技术人员帮助施工科赶绘图纸。其次，合理地调配厂里的技术力量。有的车间技术工作较少，但技术力量过多，有的技师实际上在作技术员的工作。从这些技师和技术员中间可以抽调一部分人去加强施工科。再其次，从车间抽调部分6级以上的工人到施工科担任技术员，因为车间需要6级工以上的工人干的活不多，把他们之中的一部分人抽出来，既不会影响车间的生产，又可以培养技术干部，加强技术力量。最后，从厂里具有初中文化程度的青年徒工和工作人员中选拔一部分人加以训练，可以很快成为技术员的。现在施工科担任描图小组长的就是10个月以前的一个初中学生。这样技术力量不足的问题就可以完全解决。
    经过党组织这样一系列的工作，厂的行政领导者的保守思想在逐步克服，认识在逐步提高，信心也在逐步增加。本月7日，这一计划在职工大会上宣布以后，全厂职工正在开展社会主义竞赛为提前和超额完成这一计划而紧张劳动。但是，这个厂的先进思想和保守思想的斗争并不能认为已经结束，这个厂的行政领导者是不是能够站在群众增产热潮的前面大胆领导群众前进呢？是不是能够在新的困难面前不再缩手缩脚呢？这就要看他们的实际行动了。
