Xinhua News Agency, January 1st. Chen Rongjun, a lieutenant navigation officer of the Chiang Kai-shek Navy warship "Zhonghai," returned safely to Guangzhou City last December because he was dissatisfied with the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek army, and arrived in Beijing in late January this year.

After Chen Rongjun arrived in Beijing, he was warmly received by relevant departments. Chen Rongjun also met Li Wei, a former Chiang Kai-shek navy personnel who had returned after defecting, and who was also his old classmate. Chen Rongjun talked about his feelings after returning to the motherland mainland and said: "I deeply realize that all Chiang Kai-shek military personnel in Taiwan will have a bright future only if they return to the motherland."
