    Nanjing Long-Distance Telephone Bureau Opens "Conference Call" Service

    The "conference call" service launched by the Nanjing Long-Distance Telephone Bureau of Jiangsu Province officially opened on February 1st.

    Before the official opening of the "conference call" service, an experiment was conducted with 73 cities and counties throughout the province. A meeting organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Handicraft Industry Bureau, which would have required 5 days in the past, was completed in a very short time using the "conference call" service. Participants in the meeting did not need to rush by train or boat to the meeting location; they only needed to go to the telephone. If amplification equipment is installed, the number of participants can be increased.

    The Nanjing Long-Distance Telephone Bureau has also established a "telephone conference room" equipped with amplifiers and security equipment.

    南京长途报话局开放“会议电话”
    江苏省南京长途报话局举办的“会议电话”，在2月1日正式开放。
    “会议电话”正式开放以前，曾经组织全省73个市、县进行了试验。江苏省手工业管理局所召开的一个需要5天时间的会议，用“会议电话”只用很短的时间就开完了。参加会议的人，不需要赶车赶船赶到集会地点，只需要走到电话机跟前就行了。假如再装上扩音设备，参加的人数还可以增多。
    南京长途报话局还设立了“电话会议室”，装有扩音机和保密设备。
