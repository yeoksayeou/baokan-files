Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper: Since the publication of the draft of the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan, one of the issues that has received the most attention from the American, British, French, and Western bourgeois press is the robust and rapid growth of Soviet specialists. This is because the imperialist ruling groups also know that the state of specialists who possess modern scientific and technological knowledge is the most crucial of all the necessary conditions for determining the outcome of peaceful competition.

The British "News Chronicle" once wrote: "The West is hopelessly behind in technical education." Not long ago, the London Broadcasting Station broadcast Professor Zuckerman of Birmingham University's commentary on the Soviet Union's expansion of training scientific and technological cadres. This professor compared the state of specialist training in the Soviet Union and Britain, saying that the number of people in Britain who have received higher education and obtained degrees is one-tenth of that in the Soviet Union; and that people graduating from universities and colleges in the Soviet Union are more knowledgeable than those in Britain and the United States.

Currently, more than 5.5 million specialists with higher and secondary education are working in various sectors of the Soviet national economy. There are currently 1,865,000 students studying in Soviet universities and colleges, not including correspondence students. More than 100,000 professors and lecturers are training young cadres.

In 1955, Soviet universities and colleges enrolled more than 250,000 students, about half of whom will be trained as specialists in heavy industry and about a quarter as specialists in agriculture. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, more than 1.1 million specialists graduated from Soviet universities and colleges. In 1955 alone, about 640,000 specialists graduated from higher and secondary schools in the Soviet Union; whereas before the war, only 100,000 to 110,000 people graduated from Soviet universities and colleges annually, and before the October Revolution, the number was only 10,000 per year.

The current number of university students in the Soviet Union is greater than the total number of university students in Britain, France, Italy, and other Western European capitalist countries combined. The Soviet Union currently has more engineering and technical intellectuals than any capitalist country.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, the number of specialists in the Soviet Union with higher and secondary education will increase by about half compared to the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, with the number of personnel trained for the heavy industry sector doubling.

    “西方是绝望地落后”
    本报莫斯科专电　苏联第六个五年计划草案公布以后，美、英、法和西方资产阶级报刊最为注意的问题之一，是苏联专门人材的雄厚和迅速增长，因为帝国主义统治集团也知道，掌握现代科学和技术知识的专门人材的状况是决定和平竞赛胜负的一切必要条件中最主要的条件。
    英国“新闻纪事报”曾经写道：“在技术教育方面西方是绝望地落后了”。伦敦广播台不久以前广播了伯明罕大学教授楚克曼对于苏联扩大培养科学技术干部的评论。这位教授把苏联和英国培养专门人材的状况作了比较说，英国受过高等教育和得到学位的人们为苏联的十分之一；而且在苏联比在英国、美国高等学校毕业的人们知识广博。
    在苏联国民经济各部门现在工作着550多万受过高等和中等教育的专门人材。现在苏联高等学校学习的有1，865，000人，这还不包括高等学校函授班的学生。有10万以上教授和讲师培养着年轻的干部。
    在1955年，苏联高等学校招收了25万多学生，其中约一半将培养成重工业的专门人材，约四分之一将培养成农业的专门人材。在第五个五年计划时期，从苏联高等学校毕业了110万人以上专门人材，在1955年苏联的高等和中等学校中就毕业了约64万专门人材；而在战前从苏联高等学校一年只毕业10万到11万人，在十月革命前每年毕业的不过1万人。
    现在苏联的大学生数目比英国、法国、意大利和其他西欧资本主义国家的大学生总和还要多。苏联现有的工程、技师知识分子比任何资本主义国家都要多。
    在第六个五年计划时期，苏联受过高等和中等教育的专门人材的数目将比第五个五年计划时期增加约半倍，其中为重工业部门培养的人材将增加一倍。
