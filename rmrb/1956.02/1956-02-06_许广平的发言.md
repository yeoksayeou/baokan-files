    Xu Guangping's Speech

    Chairman, Comrades:

    I express my heartfelt support for Premier Zhou's political report and the supplementary reports from the leading comrades. The scene on the opening day of the conference, where the reporting teams from industry, agriculture, handicrafts, and industrialists and businessmen reported their achievements to Chairman Mao and the leading comrades, vividly illustrates that our country has entered a high tide of socialist revolution. The rapid progress of our socialist construction undoubtedly greatly increases the sense of responsibility of intellectuals. Therefore, Premier Zhou and Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo's reports on the issue of intellectuals deeply moved me. As a female intellectual, I naturally think about the role of us female intellectuals in socialist construction. Our country's female scientists, female professors, female teachers, female engineers, female technicians, female doctors, female literary artists, and female intellectuals on other fronts have made many contributions to the various undertakings of the motherland in the past. Now, they are striving for the cause of socialist construction. These are undeniable facts. However, among our female intellectuals, because most of them grew up in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial environment, each person's acquisition of knowledge almost always involved struggling against the dark resistance of the old society and breaking through family obstacles. In that environment, it was undoubtedly something to be affirmed. But, unfortunately, some female intellectuals carry this burden, which they believe is worthy of pride, look down on others, and are not modest in learning from others; or they emphasize others' shortcomings and ignore their advantages, exhibiting "scholarly disdain for each other," and are unwilling to discard this burden, carrying it into the new society, becoming a burden on the road to socialism. Occasionally, they suffer some setbacks, become disappointed and negative, and develop feelings of inferiority. These twin sisters of arrogance and inferiority appear contradictory, but they are essentially consistent.

    Secondly, we female intellectuals sometimes still have narrow-minded ideas, and become hung up on small setbacks, like to compare, haggle over details, and even become jealous of others' strengths and defend their own weaknesses. Especially, some of our female intellectuals have a weak interest in politics, hold purely professional viewpoints, and neglect how to integrate their work with politics. The above shortcomings are left to us by the old society, and these will inevitably hinder us from better serving socialist construction. We must abandon them as we abandoned the old society.

    Comrades, intellectuals living in the Mao Zedong era are fortunate. We, unlike the previous generation of intellectuals, no longer have to struggle to find a path. Now, the broad socialist road is displayed before us, and the motherland is eagerly awaiting our efforts and dedication. Now, everything is ready, except for the east wind—the east wind is our subjective effort. We must follow Premier Zhou's report and "adopt the method of self-education, and gradually grow into intellectuals who wholeheartedly serve socialism through the three interrelated paths of observing and practicing social life, practicing our profession, and studying Marxist-Leninist theory." We female intellectuals must assure the motherland: We will certainly transform ourselves, improve ourselves, and strive to cultivate the next generation in a short period of time, so as to undertake the new historical task of building a socialist motherland together with all the working people.

    On the other hand, we should not ignore the special difficulties of female intellectuals in serving the socialist construction of the motherland. Because transitioning from the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old Chinese society to the socialist society of New China, female intellectuals face some obstacles in both their thinking and their actual lives. This requires all relevant work areas (including women's work) to vigorously cultivate, promote, and conduct ideological work on female intellectuals and solve special problems related to women. In the several years since liberation, the relevant parties have done some work, but there is still a considerable gap compared to the objective needs. For example, some departments have not done enough in cultivating, promoting, and educating female intellectuals; at the same time, today the contradiction between being a female intellectual and a wife and mother has not been completely resolved. The solution to these problems certainly depends first on the female intellectuals themselves to handle them well, but more importantly, relevant authorities should give them appropriate time to handle housework and educate their children, and vigorously establish nurseries and other necessary measures. This is a special issue concerning female intellectuals in transforming existing intellectuals and cultivating new intellectuals, and it is also an issue of allowing female intellectuals to better educate the next generation. I specifically raise this to you, hoping that everyone will pay attention to solving these problems.

    许广平的发言
    主席、各位同志：
    对周总理的政治报告和各位首长的各项补充报告，我表示衷心的拥护。会议开幕的那一天，工业、农业、手工业和工商业者的报喜队向毛主席和首长们报喜的景象，集中地说明了我国已进入了社会主义革命的高潮。我国社会主义建设事业的突飞猛进，无疑地，大大地加重了知识分子的责任感，因而周总理和郭沫若副主席报告知识分子的问题时，深深地打动了我。我作为一个女知识分子，自然就会想到我们女知识分子在社会主义建设中的作用问题。我国的女科学家、女教授、女教师、女工程师、女技术人员、女医生和女文学艺术家和其他战线上的女知识分子，她们在过去曾经在祖国的各种事业中作了不少的贡献；现在，又正在为社会主义建设事业而奋斗着，这都是无可否认的事实。但是在我们女知识分子中，由于大多数都是从半封建半殖民地的环境下成长的，每个人获得知识，差不多都要经过和旧社会的黑暗阻力作斗争，冲破家庭的阻挠，这在当时的环境来说，毫无疑问是应该肯定的。但可惜的是有些女知识分子背了这个以为值得自傲的包袱，看不起别人，不虚心向别人学习；或强调别人的缺点，忽视别人的优点，表现为“文人相轻”，舍不得丢开这个包袱，一直把它背到新社会来，成为走向社会主义程途中的累赘。她们偶尔受了些锉折，就失望消极，产生自卑情绪。这个自傲与自卑的孪生姊妹看来是矛盾的，但实质是一致的。
    其次，我们女知识分子有时还存在着狭隘思想，碰到一点小曲折就放不开，好评比，斤斤计较，甚至嫉妒别人的长处，维护自己的短处。尤其是我们有些女知识分子政治兴趣淡薄，存在着单纯业务观点，忽视如何使业务与政治相结合。以上这些缺点是旧社会遗留给我们的，这些必然妨碍我们更好地为社会主义建设服务。我们要像唾弃旧社会一样唾弃它们。
    同志们，生活在毛泽东时代的知识分子是幸福的。我们不像前一代的知识分子那样，还苦于去寻找道路。现在康庄的社会主义大路展现在我们面前，祖国又那么迫切等待我们的努力和献身。现在真是万事俱备，只欠东风——东风就是我们的主观努力了。我们要遵从周总理的报告，“采取自我教育的方法，通过社会生活的观察和实践、业务的实践和马克思列宁主义理论的学习这样三个互相联系的途径，逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子。”我们女知识分子要向祖国保证：我们一定在短时期内改造自己，提高自己，并努力培养后一代，以便与全体劳动人民一起来承担建设社会主义祖国的新的历史任务。
    在另方面，我们也不要忽视女知识分子在为祖国社会主义建设服务中的特殊困难。因为从半封建、半殖民地的旧中国社会过渡到新中国的社会主义社会，女知识分子不论在思想上在实际生活上都存在着一些障碍，这就必须从各个有关工作方面（包括妇女工作）对女知识分子大力培养、提拔、进行思想工作并解决有关妇女的特殊问题。解放几年来，各有关方面已做了一些工作，但与客观需要还有相当距离，例如还有些部门对于女知识分子的培养、提拔和思想教育工作做得很不够；同时，在今天做为一个女知识分子和妻职、母职的矛盾也还未完全得到妥善地解决，这些问题的解决固然首先要依靠女知识分子本身的善自处理，然而更重要的是有关机关给予她们以适当的时间处理家务和教育子女，并且大力建立托儿所等必要的措施。这是我们在改造现有的知识分子培养新的知识分子中有关女知识分子的一个特殊问题，同时也是让女知识分子更好地教育后一代的问题，我特向诸位提出，希望大家重视解决这些问题。
