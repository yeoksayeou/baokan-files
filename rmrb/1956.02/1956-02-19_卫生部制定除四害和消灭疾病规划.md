The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China has recently formulated a plan for eliminating the "Four Pests" and eradicating diseases.

The plan requires that by 1957, urban and industrial-mining areas should be basically rat-free. In rural areas, model rat-free villages should be created first, and within four years, a basic rat-free environment should be achieved within a ten-kilometer radius of each village. In grassland pastoral areas, the goal is to basically eliminate rats within seven years. Regarding sparrow elimination, the plan calls for achieving a one-kilometer sparrow-free zone in urban and rural areas by 1956. Within two years, the area around cities and villages within three or four kilometers should be basically sparrow-free, and within three to four years, sparrows should be basically eliminated. The plan also sets forth specific requirements for mosquito and fly extermination.

The plan specifies the types and quantities of medicines and equipment needed to eliminate the "Four Pests." It points out that health departments should strive to achieve the above requirements, and makes specific demands on relevant grain departments, agricultural and forestry water conservancy departments, construction engineering departments, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the First Ministry of Machine Building.

The disease eradication plan focuses primarily on schistosomiasis. Based on a working approach of one year for preparation, four years for combat, and two years for cleanup, and depending on the extent of the epidemic, the plan requires basic elimination within three to seven years. For malaria, which is severely prevalent in Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and other places, the plan requires widespread publicity and education in conjunction with the elimination of the "Four Pests," mobilizing the masses to prevent and exterminate mosquitoes, training non-detached malaria prevention personnel, administering preventative medication to 40 million people, and actively treating patients, with the goal of basic elimination within seven years. For epidemic encephalitis B, the plan calls for widespread vaccination of children under the age of ten nationwide, promoting traditional Chinese medicine methods for treating encephalitis B, and achieving basic elimination within seven years. Plans have also been made for the elimination of other diseases such as infantile tetanus.

The plan points out that eliminating the above diseases is the central task of all health agencies nationwide in the coming years. Regions without the above diseases can select several diseases that pose the greatest threat to the health of the local people and plan their elimination independently.

    中华人民共和国卫生部最近制定了关于除“四害”和消灭疾病的规划。
    规划要求，在1957年内城市和工矿地区做到基本无鼠，农村先创造无鼠典型村，四年内达到每村十公里范围内基本无鼠；草原牧区七年内也达到基本消灭老鼠。1956年内，做到城市和农村一公里内无雀；二年内城市和农村周围三、四公里以内做到基本无雀；三、四年内基本消灭麻雀。灭蚊和灭蝇，规划也提出了具体要求。
    除“四害”需要的药品、器械，规划提出了种类和具体数量。规划指出卫生部门应该努力实现上述要求，并对有关的粮食部门、农林水利部门、建筑工程部门、轻工业部和第一机械工业部等，提出了具体要求。
    消灭疾病的规划，首先是关于血吸虫病，根据一年准备、四年战斗、二年扫尾的工作步骤，依其流行程度，分别要求在三到七年内达到基本消灭。在云南、贵州、广东、广西、湖南、湖北等地严重流行的疟疾，要求结合除“四害”，广泛进行宣传教育，发动群众防蚊、灭蚊，训练不脱产的防疟员，进行预防性服药4，000万人，并积极治疗病人，七年内达到基本消灭。流行性乙型脑炎，要求为全国十岁以下儿童广泛进行疫苗注射，推广中医治疗乙型脑炎的方法，在七年内达到基本消灭。其他如小儿破伤风等疾病的消灭，也作了规划。
    规划指出，消灭上述疾病，是全国所有卫生机关今后几年内的中心任务。没有上述疾病的地区，可以选择几种危害当地人民健康最大的疾病，自行规划消灭。
