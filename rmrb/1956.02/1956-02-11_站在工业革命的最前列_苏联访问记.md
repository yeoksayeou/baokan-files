Standing at the Forefront of the Industrial Revolution
A Visit to the Soviet Union
Wang Yi

I.
In Moscow and Leningrad, in Minsk and Kiev, we saw large banners hanging in many of the factories we visited, proclaiming: "To struggle for our country's technological progress is to struggle for the construction of a communist society!"

This slogan was put forward at the July Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee last year. At this meeting, Comrade Bulganin pointed out in his report that due to the discovery of atomic energy, we are now facing the eve of a new scientific, technological, and industrial revolution, the significance of which far exceeds the industrial revolution brought about by the advent of steam and electricity. He called on all sectors of the Soviet national economy to take advantage of the superiority of the socialist system and surpass the achievements of foreign science and technology.

The Soviet people enthusiastically responded to this call and quickly turned it into their practice. Every Soviet comrade in the scientific and technological fields with whom we spoke could expound endlessly on their technological achievements: "The Soviet Union has built the world's first atomic power station, and more atomic power stations with greater generating capacity are now under construction"; "Speaking of the performance of jet engines, the Soviet Union occupies the highest level in the world in many respects"; "The Soviet Union's electronic computer is the fastest in Europe, performing an average of 8,000 calculations per second; a few hours of work is equivalent to the labor of tens of thousands of people"...

Of course, these are only some of the latest and greatest scientific achievements. The broader field of technological progress lies in the technical domains of various industrial enterprises: At the Molotov Steel Rolling and Wire Factory, the enthusiastic factory director, Safoyants, would personally accompany you to the rolling mill to see the new method of using radioactive radiation to measure steel strip thickness and identify steel grades; at the famous Kirov Power Plant, every designer could tell you about the miracles they have created: After using hydrogen cooling, the original design specification of 150,000 kilowatt generators can immediately increase the generating capacity by 50,000 kilowatts; and at the Belarusian Tractor Factory, the old factory director, who participated in the construction of the first batch of Soviet tractor factories—the Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory—will predict to you: In 1956, they will further increase the power of the tractors and enable them to work in various crop fields...

It should be pointed out that the new technologies adopted by the Soviet Union in 1955 also include various automatic machines, remote-controlled machines, and new radio technologies, etc. The achievements in technological progress have greatly improved the industrial production level in 1955 and laid a reliable foundation for the future development of the national economy. When we visited the Chairman of the Ukrainian State Planning Commission, we asked him this question: What important role does the new technology play in further promoting industrial production?

"Speaking of the situation in Ukraine," he said, "in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 34% of pig iron production will be achieved by improving production technology, 46.8% for steel, 36.3% for steel products, 31% for coal mining, and 40% to 90% for daily necessities." This is the glorious prospect of technological progress.

II.
In the Smolny Institute, the headquarters of the October Revolution uprising, now the office of the Leningrad City Party Committee, Comrade Samchevsky, the secretary of the City Party Committee, received us. With the desire to know not only what has been achieved, but also how it was achieved, we asked him: "What is the key to implementing the spirit of the July meeting and improving the level of industrial technology?"

He promptly interrupted the introduction of the general situation in Leningrad and turned the topic around. He said: The tasks put forward at the July meeting are multifaceted, and striving for technological progress is the most important part of it. The main task assigned to Leningrad by the Party Central Committee at present is to manufacture powerful electrical equipment and produce various automated control instruments. How to accomplish this task? He said, "Our first consideration is to raise design standards and improve process procedures. After the July meeting, every design bureau in Leningrad reconsidered their plans, demanding that all standards reach the highest standards in the world."

Unfortunately, due to the short time, we did not have time to visit the design institutions in Leningrad. But in many factories, we could see their efforts to improve design work. We visited the Minsk Heavy-Duty Automobile Factory, which was newly built after the war. Until now, the factory headquarters is still located in a row of temporary wooden bungalows outside the factory, but their output has reached the level of one car every 12 to 18 minutes. Comrade Gekazhikov, the secretary of the factory's Party committee, and Abukhov, the chief engineer, told us that in order to strengthen design work, the factory doubled the number of designers in a short period of time after the July meeting. Some of these people were transferred from universities, and some were selected from outstanding workers. They took out a stack of the latest photos of transport trucks, which were recently started to be manufactured for the forestry industry. Without increasing the horsepower of the car, they increased the capacity of the car from 8 cubic meters to 20 cubic meters, and timber with a length of less than 30 meters can be transported. Recently, they are studying how to change the original 7-ton car to a 12-ton car, while actively reducing the weight of the internal combustion engine and the diesel consumption rate.

Of course, there are many technical problems that factory designers cannot solve, which is the responsibility of scientific research institutions. A comrade in Leningrad also told us: "The close connection between scientific research institutions and production is an important link in improving the level of industrial technology. In the past, we had shortcomings in this area, but we must correct this phenomenon in the future." He said, "We must defend Marxism-Leninism, but this is by no means just explaining the A, B, C's of Marxism-Leninism, but closely linking it with production, that is, constantly improving scientific and technological research and promoting the improvement of production levels. Learning that is divorced from the reality of production is dogmatism, and propaganda work should correct this sentiment that harms our cause."

Comrades from many factories we visited told us that in addition to their own research institutions, they also frequently raised various difficult problems to scientific institutions and signed research contracts. At the Kirov Power Plant in Leningrad—this factory has received two Lenin Medals and one Red Flag Medal—we met Fu Cenhui, an intern engineer sent by the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory. "What problems do you think Chinese factories should pay attention to in improving technology?" We asked him to talk about his learning experience. "I think the connection between Chinese factories and scientific institutions is not good." He answered our question without hesitation and told us about the situation of the Kirov factory: "The Kirov factory has scientific advisors, mostly university professors and academicians. They come to the factory regularly to give reports or help solve technical problems. Especially in the process of designing new products, they can often get help and guidance from university professors."

III.
In order to improve the level of industrial technology, two aspects of experience cannot be ignored. These are the advanced experiences of the broad masses of workers in various enterprises and the experiences of various countries in the world—including capitalist countries.

In 1955 alone, approximately 1 million inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals were adopted in Soviet industry, construction, and transportation. Just mentioning this number is enough to imagine the enormous work they have done in promoting advanced experiences.

In almost every enterprise, the inventions and creations of the working masses have become the main content of the briefings made to us: Kudkevich, a fitter in Minsk, invented an automated machine for forging small parts, increasing production efficiency by 3,000%; according to the suggestions of workers in the hot rolling workshop of the Molotov Steel and Wire Factory, without changing the area of the workshop, by adding new machines and reducing workers, the production volume can be increased from 73,000 tons to 120,000 tons; the Minsk Automobile Factory implemented 1,000 rationalization proposals in 1955, saving 4 million rubles, and the production volume at the end of the year increased by 20% compared with the beginning of the year. Comrades in Leningrad also told us: "Generally speaking, after the July meeting, if all the workers' rationalization proposals are implemented, without changing equipment, and without increasing workers and sites, the city's industrial output can be increased by one to one and a half times."

In terms of learning from the experiences of capitalist countries, the Soviet scientific and technological circles have also done a lot of work. The Academy of Sciences has established an organization to provide technical and economic information, and various enterprises frequently translate relevant foreign technical magazines. The chief engineer of the Kirov Power Plant was also very interested in telling us one thing: In 1955, their factory director and some comrades went to West Germany, Austria, and Finland to visit their electrical industry; and the Central Electrical Equipment Industry Department also sent people to France, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia to visit. He said, "Although the technical level of these countries is not higher than that of the Soviet Union, there are still many merits in their machine design, operating methods, and enterprise management."

"The reason why we want to absorb the technical experience of capitalist countries is not difficult to understand." Comrade Pustavanov, director of the Industry and Transportation Department of the Pravda, said to me when talking about learning from the experiences of capitalist countries: "Capitalist countries' industries have developed for nearly a hundred years, while the Soviet Union's industry before the revolution was very backward, and even after the revolution it has only been 38 years. During this period, 20 years were either war or recovery work, and peaceful construction was only 15 to 18 years. In such a short period of time, establishing a powerful industry, of course, cannot solve all the problems, so it is very important to study and learn from foreign technical experiences. Learning from their experiences is just to use these experiences to catch up with them faster."

IV.
In the struggle to strive for the progress of industrial technology, Party committees at all levels have done tremendous organizational and educational work.

One night, we visited Comrade Konstantinovich, Minister of the Industrial Department of the Minsk Municipal Party Committee. All the working comrades of the Municipal Party Committee had already left work, and we had a long conversation in a spacious and very quiet conference room.

"After the July meeting, the work of the Municipal Party Committee has become more in-depth and more specific." After he started his conversation like this, he went on to introduce to us how to organize technical discussions, how to check the implementation of enterprises' technical organizational measures, and the large-scale educational work for the grassroots cadres of enterprises. He said: "In order to strive for technological progress, we must first do a lot of work in the Party's grassroots organizations, telling them how to solve the problem of improving technology. Recently, the Minsk Municipal Party Committee held a short-term training class, each session lasting five days, and rotated the training of branch secretaries and group leaders in the factories. We think this method is better."

He gave us a copy of the training class schedule, which contains a total of 11 lectures, most of which are about the work content and working methods of Party organizations, and some of which are about the situation of new technologies. These 11 lectures include: the technological progress of the Soviet Union, the role of the Party organizations in enterprises in the struggle to strive for technological progress, the ways to improve labor productivity in socialist enterprises, the experience of the factory Party committee in leading the workshop Party organizations, the role of the Party organization in improving the level of engineering technology, and so on.

The Municipal Party Committee also holds training classes for workshop directors, each session lasting one to two days. These training classes mainly exchange experiences, and its content varies according to the training object. For example, the training class for workshop directors in the machine factory processing workshop introduces such experiences: the process experience of metal cutting, the automation devices on metal cutting machine tools, the production organization of metal processing workshops, and so on. Sometimes there are not only reports, but also classroom performances, and everyone is organized to discuss.

The great role played by the city Party committee in the struggle to strive for technological progress is equally remarkable in other places. From July to December 1955, in 6 months, the secretary of the Leningrad Municipal Party Committee made 15 reports in enterprises. And through the propaganda network, the spirit of the July meeting was universally conveyed to the workers, mobilizing everyone to fight for the continuous improvement of labor productivity.

After visiting Soviet industrial enterprises, we were left with a deep impression: the Soviet working class, who stood at the forefront of the socialist revolution 38 years ago, is now standing at the forefront of the new industrial revolution. The victory of this revolution will bring more prosperity and a better life to mankind.

    站在工业革命的最前列
    苏联访问记
    王揖
    一
    在莫斯科和列宁格勒，在明斯克和基辅，我们访问的许多工厂里都悬挂着这样的大字标语：“为我国技术进步而斗争就是为建成共产主义社会而斗争！”
    这句口号是在去年苏共中央七月全会上提出的。在这个会上，布尔加宁同志在他的报告中指出：由于原子能的发现，目前正面临着新的科学技术和工业革命的前夕，这个革命的意义远远超过蒸气和电的出现而产生的工业革命。他号召苏联国民经济各部门必须利用社会主义制度的优越性，超过外国科学和技术的成就。
    苏联人民热烈地响应了这一个号召，并使它迅速地成为自己的实践。和我们交谈的每一位苏联科学技术界的同志，都可以用无尽的谈话来解说他们在技术方面已得的成就：“苏联已经建立了世界上第一个原子能发电站，而现在正在建设更多的和发电能力更大的原子能发电站”；“谈到喷气发动机的性能，苏联在很多方面都占居世界的最高水平。”“苏联的电子计算器，是欧洲最快的一部计算器，它平均每秒钟可做8，000次演算动作；几小时的工作，顶得上几万人的劳动”……。
    当然，这些还只是科学上最新的最巨大的成就的一部分。而技术进步的更广阔的园地，还在各个工业企业的技术领域中：在莫洛托夫轧钢和线材工厂里，热情的萨弗扬茨厂长会亲自陪同你走到轧钢机旁，参观利用放射性辐射线测量钢带厚度和辨别钢种牌号的新方法；在闻名的基洛夫电力工厂里，每一个设计人员都能向你说出他们创造的奇迹：使用氢气冷却法以后，原来设计规格为15万瓩的发电机，立即可以增加5万瓩的发电能力；而在白俄罗斯拖拉机工厂，那位曾经参加过苏联第一批拖拉机厂——车里雅宾斯克拖拉机厂建厂工程的老厂长则会向你预告：1956年内，他们将进一步增加拖拉机的威力，并使它能在各种农作物耕地中工作……。
    应当指出的是，1955年苏联采用的新技术，还包括各种自动机器、远距操纵机器和无线电的新技术等等方面。技术进步方面的成就，大大提高了1955年的工业生产水平，并对今后国民经济的发展奠定了可靠的基础。我们在访问乌克兰国家计划委员会主席的时候，曾经向他提出了这样的问题：新的技术在进一步促进工业生产方面究竟占着怎样重要的地位呢？
    “就乌克兰的情况来谈，”他说：“在第六个五年计划中，生铁的产量将有34％是依靠改进生产技术而得到的，钢为46.8％，钢材为36.3％，采煤为31％，日用必需品为40％到90％。”——这就是技术进步的辉煌的远景。
    二
    在十月革命起义的总部——斯摩尔雷大厦，现在列宁格勒市委的办公之处，市委书记萨姆且夫斯基同志接见了我们。我们怀着不仅要知道已经有了什么，而且要知道是怎样有了的欲望向他问道：“为了贯彻七月会议的精神，提高工业技术水平的关键是什么呢？”
    他及时地中断了关于列宁格勒市的一般情况的介绍，把话题转了过来。他说：七月会议提出的任务是多方面的，争取技术进步是其中最重要的一部分。党中央交给列宁格勒市当前的主要任务是制造强有力的电力设备，生产各种自动化的操纵仪器。如何完成这个任务呢？他说：“我们首先注意的是提高设计标准和改进工艺过程。七月会议以后，列宁格勒的每个设计局都重新考虑了他们的计划，要求在各项标准上都达到世界最高的标准。”
    非常可惜，因为时间太短，我们来不及访问列宁格勒的设计机关。但是在很多工厂里，都可以看到他们在改进设计工作方面的努力。我们访问过明斯克载重汽车工厂，这个工厂是战后新建的。直到目前为止，工厂的厂部还设在厂外的一排木质的临时平房中，但是他们的产量却已经达到了每12分钟到18分钟出一辆汽车的水平。工厂的党委书记格卡日科夫和总工程师阿布霍夫告诉我们，为了加强设计工作，在七月会议以后的短短时间内，工厂里增加了一倍的设计人员，这些人有的是从大学里调来的，有的是从优秀的工人中选拔的。他们拿出一叠最新的运输卡车的照片，这是不久前开始为森林工业制造的。在不增加汽车的马力的条件下，他们使汽车的容量由8立方公尺增至20立方公尺，长短在30公尺以内的木材都可装运。最近，他们正在研究使原载重7吨的汽车能变为载重12吨，同时积极减轻内燃机的重量和柴油消耗率。
    当然，也有很多技术问题，是工厂设计人员不能解决的，那就是科学研究机关的责任了。也是列宁格勒的一位同志告诉我们：“科学研究机关同生产的密切联系，是提高工业技术水平的重要环节。过去我们在这方面的工作还有缺点，但是今后要改正这种现象。”他说：“我们要保卫马克思列宁主义，但这决不只是说明马克思列宁主义的A、B、C，而是要同生产密切联系起来，也就是要不断改进科学技术的研究工作，促使生产水平的提高。脱离生产实际的学习是教条主义者，宣传工作应该纠正这种危害我们事业的情绪。”
    我们访问的很多工厂的同志们都告诉我们说，他们除了本厂的研究机构外，还经常向科学机关提出各种疑难问题，签订研究合同。在列宁格勒基洛夫电力厂——这个工厂曾得到两次列宁勋章和一次红旗勋章，我们和哈尔滨电机厂派去的实习工程师傅岑晖见面了。“你觉得中国的工厂在提高技术方面应该注意一些什么问题？”我们请他谈谈学习心得。“我认为中国的工厂和科学机关联系的还不好。”——他毫不迟疑的回答了我们的问题，并把基洛夫工厂的情况告诉我们：“基洛夫工厂有科学顾问，多是大学教授和科学院士。他们定期到工厂来作报告或帮助解决技术上的疑难问题。特别是在新产品设计过程中，经常可以得到大学教授们的帮助和指导。”
    三
    为了提高工业的技术水平，有两方面的经验是不容忽视的。这就是各企业广大工人群众的先进经验和世界各国——包括资本主义国家的经验。
    1955年一年内，苏联工业、建筑业和运输业中一共采取了约100万项发明、技术改良和合理化建议。只要举出这个数字，就可以想像到他们在推广先进经验方面所作的巨大的工作。
    差不多在每个企业里，工人群众的发明创造都成了向我们所作的情况介绍的主要内容：明斯克的一位钳工库德克维奇，发明了一种煅压小型零件的自动化机器，生产效率提高了3，000％；根据莫洛托夫钢材和线材工厂热轧车间工人的建议，在不改变车间面积的条件下，用增加新的机器和减少工人的办法，可以使生产量由73，000吨提高到12万吨；明斯克汽车工厂1955年推行了1，000件合理化建议，节约了400万卢布，年底比年初生产量提高了20％。列宁格勒的同志们也告诉我们：“总的讲来，七月会议以后，工人的合理化建议如果都执行了，不用改变设备，也不增加工人和场地，就可以把全市的工业产量提高一倍到一倍半。”
    在学习资本主义国家的经验方面，苏联科学技术界也同样作了很多工作。科学院设立了一个供给技术经济情况的机构，各个企业也经常翻译有关的外国技术杂志。基洛夫电力工厂的总工程师还很有兴趣地告诉我们一件事：1955年，他们的厂长和一部分同志，曾到西德、奥地利和芬兰参观他们的电气工业；而中央电工器材工业部也曾派人去法国、瑞典和捷克斯洛伐克参观。他说：“虽然这些国家的技术水平不比苏联高，但是他们的机器设计、操作方法和企业管理方面，仍有很多可取之处。”
    “我们要吸收资本主义国家技术经验的原因是不难了解的”。真理报工业和交通运输业部主任普斯塔瓦诺夫同志和我谈到学习资本主义国家的经验的时候说：“资本主义国家的工业经过了近百年的发展，而苏联革命以前的工业很落后，革命后也只38年。在这个期间，有20年不是战争就是恢复工作，和平建设仅仅15年至18年。这样短短的时间内，建立了强有力的工业，当然不能解决所有问题，因此研究和学习外国在技术方面的经验就很重要了。学习他们的经验，只不过是利用这些经验更快地赶过他们。”
    四
    在争取工业技术进步的斗争中，各级党委作了巨大的组织和教育工作。
    一个夜间，我们访问了明斯克市委工业部部长康斯坦丁诺维奇同志。市委所有的工作同志都已经下班了，我们在一间宽大的十分安静的会议室里进行了长时间的谈话。
    “七月会议以后，市委的工作深入的多了，也具体的多了。”他这样开始了他的谈话以后，接着就向我们介绍了如何组织技术讨论、如何检查企业技术组织措施的执行情况，以及对企业的基层干部的规模极大的教育工作。他说：“为了争取技术的进步，我们首先必须在党的基层组织进行很多工作，告诉他们如何解决提高技术的问题。最近明斯克市委举办了一种短期训练班，每期五天，轮训工厂里的支部书记和小组长。这种办法我们认为是比较好的。”
    他送给我们一份训练班的课程表，其中共有11个讲题，大部分是讲述党组织的工作内容和工作方法，也有一些是介绍新技术的情况的。这11个讲题中有：苏联的技术进步，企业党组织在为争取技术进步而斗争中的作用，提高社会主义企业中劳动生产率的道路，工厂党委领导车间党组织的经验，党组织在提高工程技术水平方面的作用等等。
    市委工业部同时也为车间主任举办训练班，每期一天到两天。在这种训练班上主要是交换经验，它的内容根据训练对象而有所不同。例如在机器工厂加工车间的车间主任训练班上，就介绍这样的经验：金属切削的工艺经验，金属切削机床上的自动化装置，金属加工车间的生产组织等等。有时不仅作报告，还有课堂表演，并组织大家讨论。
    城市党委在争取技术进步的斗争中所起的巨大作用，在其它地方也同样是很显著的。1955年7月到12月，6个月中列宁格勒市委书记就在企业中作了15次报告。并通过宣传员网在工人中普遍传达了七月会议的精神，动员大家为不断地提高劳动生产率而斗争。
                  ×××
    访问苏联工业企业以后，给我们留下了一个深深的印象：38年前站在社会主义革命最前列的苏联工人阶级，今天又正站在新的工业革命的最前列，这个革命的胜利，将给人类带来更其繁荣和美好的生活。
