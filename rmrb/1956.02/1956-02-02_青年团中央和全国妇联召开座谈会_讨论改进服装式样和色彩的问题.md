    Communist Youth League Central Committee and All-China Women's Federation Hold Symposium to Discuss Improving Clothing Styles and Colors

    How to improve the style, cut, and color of clothing was the central topic of a symposium held on February 1st by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Women's Federation.

    At the symposium, speakers generally believed that current clothing styles and colors are too monotonous and cannot reflect the increasingly beautiful and happy lives of the Chinese people today. They advocated improving clothing styles and increasing clothing colors based on the principles of economy, practicality, and aesthetics. Many speakers also pointed out that to change the current monotonous clothing styles and colors, it is first necessary to break down some erroneous understandings that hinder the improvement of clothing, and to strictly distinguish the people's love of beauty from the bourgeoisie's extravagance and corruption. Luo Yi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, said at the meeting that clothing is a manifestation of social and cultural life, and as the lives of the Chinese people get better and better, people's clothing must also become more and more beautiful. He especially hoped that young men and women would take the lead in beautifying themselves.

    The symposium also discussed the preparations for an exhibition on clothing styles and printed fabric varieties to be held in Beijing in March this year, as well as the future promotion of the issue of improving clothing through newspapers and periodicals.

    Representatives from relevant departments such as the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Commerce, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese Artists Association, the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation, and the China National General Merchandise Company attended the symposium on February 1st.

    青年团中央和全国妇联召开座谈会
    讨论改进服装式样和色彩的问题
    如何改进服装的式样、剪裁和色彩，是中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华全国民主妇女联合会1日召开的一个座谈会上讨论的中心。
    在座谈会上，发言的人都认为，目前的服装式样和色彩太单调，不能反映今天中国人民日益美好、幸福的生活。他们主张根据经济、实用和美观的原则，来改进服装式样，增加服装的色彩。许多人在发言中还指出，要改变现在的单调的服装式样和色彩，首先必须打破阻碍改进服装问题的一些错误认识，要把人民群众的爱美同资产阶级的奢侈腐化严格地加以区分。青年团中央书记处书记罗毅在会上说，服装是社会文化生活的一种表现，今天中国人民的生活正在越过越好，人民的服装也必须越来越美丽。他特别希望男女青年带头把自己美化起来。
    这个座谈会还讨论了今年3月间在北京举行有关服装式样、花布品种的展览会的准备工作，以及今后通过报刊开展关于改进服装问题的宣传问题。
    参加1日座谈会的有文化部、商业部、中华全国总工会、中国美术家协会、中国花纱布公司和中国百货公司等有关部门的代表。
