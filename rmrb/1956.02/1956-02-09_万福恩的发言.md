Chairman, fellow committee members, esteemed colleagues:

I am a medical worker engaged in health administration in Tianjin. I fully support Premier Zhou's "Political Report," Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo's report on "The Mission of Intellectuals in the High Tide of the Socialist Revolution," and the reports of Vice-Chairmen Chen Shutong and Dong Biwu. Now, I would like to say a few words on behalf of the intellectuals in the medical community of Tianjin.

At the end of last year, we in Tianjin participated in a symposium of intellectuals convened by representatives of the National People's Congress and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the meeting, the representatives, on behalf of the government, sought our opinions individually. A few days ago, we read Premier Zhou's report of January 14, "On the Question of Intellectuals," which made us feel both a great sense of responsibility and boundless comfort and inspiration. In recent years, the things we hoped for, the government has done for us. For example, we hoped to have more time to read and conduct research, and the Party has made clear provisions and specific instructions in this regard. We hoped to adjust inappropriate arrangements in our work positions, and the Party has made decisions in this regard. We hoped to reduce unnecessary meetings and concurrent posts, and the Party has made arrangements in this regard. We hoped to have planned and systematic learning, and the Party has created the conditions for us in this regard. In addition, the Party has also decided to strengthen its ideological and political leadership over us, to trust us, support us, teach us how to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and take care of our lives. All this has made us more deeply appreciate the Party's meticulous concern for us; and more deeply appreciate the sincere efforts of the People's Government towards intellectuals: "deep love, high expectations."

Intellectuals in the Tianjin medical community, like intellectuals throughout the country, have, in the years since liberation, under the education of the Party and the People's Government, and through the study of theory, the practice of their own professions, and the observation and practice of social life, made certain progress in their thinking. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work, and our professional level and political awareness are still not able to adapt to the needs of the rapidly developing socialist cause. In the medical community, there is still a strong bourgeois individualism, specifically manifested in the continuous occurrence of accidents of responsibility. In the second half of 1955, we launched an ideological remolding movement in the Tianjin medical community to "eliminate accidents of responsibility," and on the basis of conscious voluntarism, combined with specific work, launched a criticism of bourgeois individualistic thought. This movement brought us the following preliminary gains:

(1) The bourgeois individualistic thought (manifested in irresponsibility, carelessness, violation of operating procedures, disunity, and lack of peace of mind in one's work) was severely criticized among intellectuals, and criticism and self-criticism were profoundly unfolded.

(2) It was deeply realized that senior intellectuals can and are willing to accept criticism. In the past, some leading comrades had concerns about criticizing senior intellectuals, and therefore did not dare to use the weapon of criticism among senior intellectuals. This is a wrong understanding, a manifestation of leadership lagging behind the masses, and a right-leaning conservative ideology.

(3) Serious accidents of responsibility have been greatly reduced. In the first three quarters of 1955 (before and at the beginning of the movement), an average of 44 serious accidents occurred per quarter; in the fourth quarter (at the end of the movement), only 12 serious accidents occurred.

The above facts show that criticism and self-criticism can be carried out among senior intellectuals. Moreover, we believe that an effective way to conduct ideological remolding in the medical community is through the inspection and criticism of accidents of responsibility, thereby achieving the goals of improving quality, exerting strength, strengthening unity, and establishing the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly.

However, we will never be complacent because of this. We are "responsible intellectuals" and "are all seriously considering: how can we live up to the expectations of the Party and the government and complete the glorious and arduous tasks given by the motherland?"

I now, on behalf of the intellectuals in the medical community of Tianjin, make the following guarantees here:

(1) On the existing basis, further strengthen political study and ideological remolding, unite more closely around the Party, and strive to consolidate the great alliance of workers, peasants and intellectuals in our country in the socialist cause.

(2) Conscientiously implement the policy of traditional Chinese medicine, strengthen the unity of Chinese and Western medicine, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, do a good job in urban factory and mining hygiene work, and realize the requirements for medical work in the "National Agricultural Development Program."

(3) Contribute our strength unreservedly in teaching, training talents and scientific research.

(4) In this "high tide of the great socialist revolution," we are determined to overcome all difficulties, heighten our vigilance, and be medical workers who wholeheartedly serve the socialist cause.

    万福恩的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    我是一个医务工作者，在天津市做卫生行政工作。我完全拥护周总理的“政治报告”，郭沫若副主席的“在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命”的报告和陈叔通及董必武副主席的报告。现在我代表天津市医务界的知识分子说几句话。
    去年年底，我们在天津市参加了由全国人民代表大会代表和政协委员召开的知识分子座谈会。在会中代表们代表政府向我们每个人征求了意见。前几天在报纸上我们看到周总理在1月14日“关于知识分子问题”的报告，使我们一方面感到责任之重大，一方面感到无限地安慰和振奋。几年来，我们所希望的事，政府都替我们办到了。例如，我们希望多有些时间来看书，来进行研究工作，党在这方面做了明确的规定和具体的指示；我们希望调整在工作岗位上存在的不适当的安排，党在这方面作了决定；我们希望减少不必要的会议和兼职，党在这方面有了布置；我们希望有计划有系统地学习，党在这方面为我们创造了条件。除此之外，党还决定加强对于我们的思想和政治领导，信任我们，支持我们，教导我们怎样展开批评和自我批评，照顾我们的生活。这一切，都使我们更深刻地体会到党对于我们无微不至的关怀；更深刻地体会到人民政府对知识分子“爱之深，望之切”的苦心。
    天津市医务界的知识分子，同全国的知识分子一样，自解放后的几年来，在党和人民政府的教育下，通过理论学习、自己业务的实践和社会生活的观察和实践，在思想上有了一定的提高。但是，在我们的工作之中还有不少缺点，在业务水平方面和政治觉悟方面还不能适应社会主义事业急速发展的需要。在医务界中还存在着浓厚的资产阶级个人主义思想，具体表现在责任事故的不断发生。1955年下半年，我们在天津市医务界中展开了“消灭责任事故”的思想改造运动，在自觉自愿的基础上，结合具体业务展开了对于资产阶级个人主义思想的批判。这一个运动给我们带来了以下的初步收获：
    （1）在知识分子中严重地批判了资产阶级个人主义思想（表现在不负责、粗枝大叶、违反操作规程、不团结、不安心于本位工作等），深刻地展开了批评和自我批评。
    （2）深刻地体会到高级知识分子是可以而且乐意接受批评的。过去有些领导同志对于批评高级知识分子有顾虑，因此不敢在高级知识分子中使用批评的武器。这是错误的认识，是领导落后于群众的表现，是右倾保守思想。
    （3）严重的责任事故大大地减少了。在1955年前3个季度中（运动未开始和开始初期），平均每季度中有44件严重事故发生；在第四季度中（运动末期），只有12件严重事故发生。
    以上事实说明，在高级知识分子之间是可以展开批评和自我批评的。而且我们认为，在医务界进行思想改造的有效方法是通过责任事故的检查和批判，由此而达到提高质量、发挥力量、加强团结和树立全心全意为人民服务的目的。
    但是，我们决不因此而自满。我们是“有责任心的知识分子”，也“都在认真地考虑着：要怎样才能够不辜负党和政府的期待，来完成祖国所给与的光荣而艰巨的任务”。
    我现在代表天津市医务界的知识分子，在这里做以下的保证：
    （1）在现有的基础上，进一步加强政治学习和思想改造，更紧密地团结在党的周围，为巩固我国工人、农民和知识分子在社会主义事业中的伟大联盟而奋斗。
    （2）认真地贯彻中医政策，加强中西医的团结，学习苏联先进经验，做好城市厂矿卫生工作，实现“全国农业发展纲要”中对医务工作的要求。
    （3）在教学、培养人才和科学研究方面，毫无吝惜地贡献出自己的力量。
    （4）在这“伟大社会主义革命的高潮中”，决心克服一切困难，提高警惕，作一个全心全意为社会主义事业服务的医务工作者。
