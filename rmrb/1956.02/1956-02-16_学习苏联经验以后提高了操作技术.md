In October 1955, Feodorov, an outstanding Soviet lathe operator, gave a demonstration of rapid cutting technology at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory. He used four cuts to create a 3mm thread and completed the quota, which was set at 4 hours and 50 minutes, in just 1 minute and 18 seconds.

Feodorov's demonstration greatly encouraged the workers of Taiyuan to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. On the first day after his demonstration, some advanced workers automatically improved their operating techniques. Liu Xinghe, the leader of the Youth Advanced Production Group at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, completed 34 hours' worth of work in just 9 hours.

To better organize workers to learn Feodorov's advanced operating methods, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory organized a training class of 50 outstanding young lathe operators in early November 1955. The class started at 10:30 PM, but workers on the day shift, such as Lin Qidai and Zhang Huishan from the repair shop, preferred to sleep late and get up early to attend the classes on time. Some people who were not trainees also came to listen voluntarily.

Feodorov's demonstration and the excellent results achieved by some workers in the factory in learning and promoting the experience profoundly educated those who doubted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. However, some people still believed that "more than 60% of our factory's machine tools are old, no matter how good the experience is, it can't be applied to our old belt-driven lathes that are like ox carts." To overcome this conservative thinking, the factory organized another demonstration on November 23, in which young worker Cheng Jinyue demonstrated Feodorov's cutting experience on an 8-foot belt-driven lathe.

Cheng Jinyue is a seventh-grade lathe operator. After watching Feodorov's demonstration, he admired Feodorov from the bottom of his heart. However, he was also worried about whether this experience could be promoted on old belt-driven lathes. Later, he participated in the advanced experience promotion training class with the attitude of "trying it out." In the training class, after he gained a more comprehensive understanding of this advanced experience from a technical point of view, he became bolder. The first time, he used Markov's offset tool to turn a small shaft, reducing the quota by 5 hours. Then, he used Feodorov's advanced experience to break the quota again and again. Now, when the organization asked him to perform, he was both excited and nervous. The quota for the workpiece in this demonstration was 2 hours and 40 minutes, but in reality, many workers would take 5 hours to complete it. However, Cheng Jinyue carefully prepared the tool fixtures, adjusted the machine load, and maximized the machine's efficiency, increasing the cutting speed to 400 revolutions per minute and the depth of cut to 5 mm, completing the task in just 39 minutes.

People couldn't help but express their excitement and discussed, "People who couldn't complete the task before always said that the quota was high, but now they realize that it's not that the quota is high, but that our technology is low and our thinking is conservative."

Currently, at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, 62 machine tools and 29 lathe operators have initially promoted Feodorov's advanced experience. The factory plans to conduct a general round of training for lathe operators before the first quarter of this year. It is expected that after this work is completed, the production capacity of the factory's old lathes will increase by 25% compared to now, and the new lathes can increase by 50%. If all the lathe operators in the factory can save half the time used by Feodorov in terms of auxiliary work hours, production efficiency can be further increased by 13%.

    学习苏联经验以后提高了操作技术
    李谦生　李文禄
    1955年10月，苏联优秀旋工费奥多洛夫在太原矿山机器厂作了一次快速切削技术表演。他用4刀挑成了3公厘的丝扣，用1点18分钟的时间完成了太原矿山机器厂4点50分钟的定额。
    费奥多洛夫的表演大大鼓舞了太原市工人学习苏联先进经验的热情。在他表演后的第一天，一些先进工人都自动改进操作技术。太原矿山机器厂青年先进生产小组组长刘兴合就用9个小时完成了34小时的定额。
    为了更好地组织工人学习费奥多洛夫的先进操作法，太原矿山机器厂在1955年11月上旬组织了一个包括50名优秀青年车工的训练班。这个班是晚上10点半上课，但是，那些上白班的工人，如修理车间青年工人林七贷、张怀善等，宁可迟睡早起，也要按时来学习。有的人不是学员也自动来听课。
    费奥多洛夫的表演和厂里一些工人在学习推广中取得的优异成绩，使那些怀疑苏联先进经验的人受到了深刻的教育。但是，还有人认为“咱们厂有60％以上是旧机床，经验再好，咱那老牛车般的旧皮带车床也用不上。”为了克服这种保守思想，工厂又在11月23日组织了一次表演，由青年工人程金岳在一部8呎皮带车床上表演费奥多洛夫的切削经验。
    程金岳是个七级车工。他看了费奥多洛夫的表演以后，从心眼里敬佩费奥多洛夫。但是也曾为能否在旧皮带车床上推广这个经验耽心过。后来，他抱着“试一试看”的态度参加了推广先进经验训练班。在训练班里，他从技术原理上比较全面地理解这项先进经验以后，胆子才大起来。第一次，他用马尔科夫偏刀车小轴，降低定额5小时。接着，他又运用费奥多洛夫的先进经验一次又一次地突破了定额。现在，当组织上让他表演的时候，他兴奋而又紧张。这次表演的工作物的定额工时是2点40分钟，实际上许多工人要用5点钟才能完成。但是，程金岳周密地作好了刀卡具的准备工作，调整了机床负荷，发挥了机床的最大效能，使车速每分钟达到了400转，吃刀量加大到5公厘，只用39分钟就完成了任务。
    人们抑制不住内心的激动、纷纷议论道：“以前完不成任务的人老说定额高，现在才认识到并不是定额高，而是咱们的技术低，思想保守。”
    现在，在太原矿山机器厂里，已经有62部机床、29个车工初步推广了费奥多洛夫的先进经验。这个厂计划在今年第一季度以前，对车工普遍进行一次轮训。预计在这一工作完成后，全厂的旧式车床的生产能力，将比现在提高25％，新式车床可以提高50％。如果全厂车工在节省辅助工时方面也能达到费奥多洛夫所用时间一半的水平，生产效率还可以再提高13％。
