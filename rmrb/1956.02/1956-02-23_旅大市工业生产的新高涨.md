	New Upsurge in Industrial Production in Lüda City
	Lüda Daily reporter
	A new upsurge has appeared in industrial production in Lüda City. The excellent completion of the national plan in January is unprecedented in past years. Among state-owned factories, 16 factories are expected to have completed their output value plans (only 6 last year), and 11 factories have comprehensively completed their output value, total commodity value, labor productivity, cost, and profit delivery plans (only 3 last year). Among the 28 local state-owned factories, 21 factories completed their output value plans. (Other indicators have not been calculated.) The long-standing phenomenon of "slack at the beginning of the year and tight at the end, slack at the beginning of the quarter and tight at the end" in industrial production has undergone a fundamental change. To date, over 90% of factories and enterprises have proposed plans to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. After these plans were submitted to workers for discussion, the original targets were repeatedly surpassed by the workers. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory reached the 1957 production level in November last year. In January this year, the factory proposed to complete the total output value plan stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan six months ahead of schedule. After discussion by the workers, this plan was surpassed again, with locomotive production increasing by 11.1% compared to the original target, gondola cars by 9.6%, and tank cars for viscous oil by 96.2%. Therefore, the factory revised the plan and decided to complete the output value plan stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan seven and a half months ahead of schedule. The Dalian Chemical Plant's plan to reach the 1957 production level 13 months ahead of schedule was also surpassed by the workers. The ammonium sulfate output of the Eighth Workshop can guarantee reaching the 1957 production level 14 months ahead of schedule. This factory increased production of ammonium sulfate by 505 tons for farmers in January. The Dalian Steel Plant had failed to complete the national plan at the beginning of the year for the past two years, but completed it ahead of schedule in January this year, and the quality of the steel exceeded the 1957 target. Now, this factory has decided to reach the 1957 production level 14 months ahead of schedule. Employees of the Dalian Railway Sub-bureau have also launched a surge to complete the five-year transportation tasks ahead of schedule. By January 31, 9 stations and sections and 261 production teams had proposed guarantees to complete the five-year plan ahead of schedule.
	The Lüda City Industrial Bureau requires local industries to reach the 1957 production level one year ahead of schedule. Many factories have already surpassed this target. The Lüda Potassium Chlorate Factory decided to reach the 1957 production level one year and five months ahead of schedule. The Lüda Machinery Hardware General Factory initially determined that it could reach the 1957 production level 14 months ahead of schedule. Many factories are increasing production, expanding varieties, and ensuring early delivery. The Lüda City Industrial Bureau decided to add more than 1,300 new varieties and specifications in 1956 and 1957, including products for supporting agricultural production such as fruit tree loosening plows, fruit tree fertilization plows, portable steam engines, and gas engines.
	In terms of supporting key projects, many factories have shown valuable enthusiasm. In the past, some factories emphasized difficulties when accepting orders, but now they are actively accepting orders and taking the initiative to propose early delivery. The Dalian General Machinery Factory completed the three types of equipment ordered by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant ahead of schedule in January. The Dalian Crane Factory also guaranteed to deliver the 5 cranes urgently needed by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant half a month to three months ahead of schedule. The Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory actively overcame the difficulties of trial-producing new products and took the initiative to advance the delivery dates of the 4 types of special vehicles ordered by Benxi Iron and Steel Company and Anshan Iron and Steel Company by one month to three months. The Lüda Kiln and Mine General Factory also decided to deliver the refractory bricks ordered by Anshan Iron and Steel Company one month ahead of schedule. In order to accelerate the construction of the Dahuofang Reservoir, workers at the Dalian Shipyard delivered a batch of sand dredgers ahead of schedule.
	The initial industrial production upsurge in Lüda City not only has profound awareness but also has a mass foundation from the bottom up. Many workers broke with conventions, boldly reformed technology, and multiplied production efficiency. The Dalian Motor Factory produced one and a half times more AC motors this year than last year, and the manual operation of the take-off team could not complete this task. However, the technicians of the AC Locomotive Workshop's process team collectively created a jig, which increased production efficiency by fourteen times and met the production task requirements. Workers in the Gao Dunquan team at the Dalian Electrical Appliance Factory learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, changed the raw material composition for making "arc chutes," and increased production efficiency by more than twenty-three times, completing the task that would have taken two and a half years in one month. Meng Xianyuan, the head of the welding rod section of the Dalian Crane Factory, in cooperation with technicians and workers, improved the batching composition and operation method, reducing the scrap rate from 18.1% to 7.8%, which can increase production and save more than 140,000 yuan for the country in one year and complete the annual work plan in 8 months. Ma Wenxin, a young worker at this factory, created a pre-deformation method, which initially solved the key problem of large beam deformation that had not been resolved for many years. Workers in the calcination workshop of the Dalian Alkali Plant proposed an improved production method that can increase the production of soda ash by more than 30,000 tons per year.

    旅大市工业生产的新高涨
    旅大日报记者
    旅大市工业生产出现了新的高涨。1月份完成国家计划的良好情况是历年来所没有的。在国营工厂中，预计完成了产值计划的有16个工厂（去年只6个），全面完成了产值、商品总值、劳动生产率、成本、上缴利润计划的有11个工厂（去年只有3个）。在28个地方国营工厂中，有21个工厂完成了产值计划。（其它指标没计算出来）。长期以来工业生产上年初松、年末紧，季初松、季末紧的现象有了根本的改变。到目前为止，已经有90％以上的工厂企业提出了提前完成第一个五年计划的规划。这些规划交给工人讨论以后，原订指标被工人一再突破。大连机车车辆制造工厂在去年11月份就达到了1957年的生产水平。今年1月，厂里提出的提前半年完成第一个五年计划规定的总产值计划，经过工人讨论以后又被突破，机车的产量比原订指标提高11.1％，棚车提高9.6％，粘油槽车提高96.2％。于是工厂重新修订了规划，决定提前七个半月完成第一个五年计划规定的产值计划。大连化学厂提出的提前13个月达到1957年生产水平的计划也被工人突破了。第八车间的硫酸铵产量可以保证提前14个月达到1957年的生产水平。这个厂在1月份就为农民增产了505吨硫酸铵。大连钢厂过去两年年初都没有完成国家计划，今年1月份却提前完成了，而且钢的质量超过了1957年的指标，现在这个厂决定提前14个月达到1957年的生产水平。大连铁路分局的职工也掀起了提前完成五年运输任务的热潮。到1月31日，有9个站段和261个生产班组提出了提前完成五年计划的保证。
    旅大市工业局要求地方工业提前1年达到1957年的生产水平。现在很多工厂已经突破了这一指标。旅大氯酸钾厂决定提前1年5个月达到1957年的生产水平。旅大机械五金总厂初步确定可提前14个月达到1957年生产水平。很多工厂纷纷增加生产，扩大品种，保证提前交货。旅大市工业局决定在1956年和1957年内增加新品种、新规格1，300多种。其中包括支援农业生产用的果树松土犁、果树施肥犁、锅驼机、煤气机等产品。
    在支援重点工程方面，许多工厂更表现了可贵的热情。过去有些工厂接受订货时强调困难，现在却主动接受订货，并主动提出要提前交货。大连通用机器厂在1月份已经提前完成了第一汽车制造厂订制的三种设备。大连起重机器厂也保证把第一汽车制造厂急需的5台起重机提前半个月到3个月交货。大连工矿车辆厂积极克服试造新产品的困难，主动把本溪钢铁公司和鞍山钢铁公司订制的4种特殊车辆的交货日期，提前了1个月到3个月。旅大窑矿总厂也决定把鞍山钢铁公司订制的耐火砖提前1个月交货。为了加速大伙房水库的建设，大连造船公司工人提前交出了一批挖砂船。
    旅大市初步形成的工业生产高潮不但具有深刻的自觉性，而且具有从下而上的群众基础。许多工人打破了陈规惯例，大胆改革技术，使生产效率成倍地提高。大连电机厂今年交流电动机的生产比去年多了一倍半，下线小组的手工操作无法完成这一任务。但是交流机车间工艺组的技术人员集体创造了一种胎具，使生产效率提高了十四倍，满足了生产任务的要求。大连电工器材厂高顿全小组工人学习苏联先进经验，改变了制作“消弧罩”的原料成分，提高了生产效率二十三倍多，使过去两年半才能完成的任务一个月就完成了。大连起重机器厂焊条工段工段长孟宪元在技术人员和工人的配合下，改进了配料成分和操作方法，使废品率从18.1％减少到7.8％，一年可给国家增产节约14万多元的财富，8个月就可以完成全年的工作计划。这个厂的青年工人马文鑫创造了预先变形的方法，初步解决了历年来一直没有得到解决的大梁变形的关键问题。大连碱厂煅烧车间的工人提出了一项改进生产的方法，可以使纯碱的产量每年增加3万多吨。
