Chairman, fellow committee members:

I am engaged in agricultural education and experimental research work in Henan Province. I feel very honored to be able to attend the CPPCC meeting. After listening to Premier Zhou's and other leaders' reports, I have a clearer understanding of the direction of my future work. I wholeheartedly support it and will implement it in my own work. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity to speak at the conference, I would like to offer some of my personal opinions for the consideration and correction of the committee members and comrades.

1. The 40-article National Agricultural Development Program has given me great encouragement, and we are determined to complete the task.

The 40-article National Agricultural Development Program proposed by the Party Central Committee this time was formulated under the personal guidance and analysis and research of Chairman Mao. It has the material basis to guarantee the completion of the task. Because after agricultural cooperativization transitioned from the elementary to the advanced stage, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has become even greater, which is the most powerful guarantee for completing the tasks proposed in the 40-article program. In addition, with measures such as water conservancy and agricultural technology reform, the guarantee is even more practical. Taking Henan as an example, since liberation, great achievements have been made on the agricultural production front. Last year, the central government issued a call to develop high-yield crops, which has also achieved great results in Henan. In addition, in terms of cotton production increase, since Xinjiang sent model workers and lecturers to Henan Province last winter to impart the cotton planting technology of Titov experts, Henan's cotton farmers and scientific and technological workers have learned a new set of cotton production increase technological measures. Therefore, after the meeting, some cotton-producing areas' production cooperatives formulated a thousand-mu thousand-jin cotton bumper harvest plan. Now, under the leadership of the local Party and government and technical guidance, the farmers of Henan Province are vigorously turning winter leisure into winter busy, engaging in various preparations to welcome this year's large-scale production. Last year, Henan Province had already overfulfilled the 1957 grain production target. The provincial agricultural labor model conference held in January this year shows that many large-area bumper harvest events emerged in last year's agricultural production. These are all brilliant achievements due to the farmers' display of production enthusiasm under the leadership of the Party and the government. Naturally, this is also inseparable from the contribution of intellectuals and agricultural scientific and technological personnel in technical guidance. Therefore, I believe that these forty articles can not only be completed, but also be overfulfilled. I am also willing to work with other agricultural scientific and technological workers to engage in this great cause.

2. Strengthen agricultural scientific research to meet the arrival of the production upsurge.

The arrival of the production upsurge follows closely on the heels of the cooperativization upsurge. At this year's Henan Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference, the farmers' desire for science and technology was very prominent. Our scientific level is not high, and the number of scientific and technological talents is also limited, making it difficult to cope with the demands of agricultural production in this booming development. I firmly believe that only under the unified leadership of the Party can we form a force to march towards science and solve production problems; at the same time, the results of scientific research can truly play a role in the national economy.

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, many young agricultural scientific workers have been trained. They have played a certain role in agricultural production, agricultural education and scientific research. This is a new force, very lovely and precious, and should be continuously cultivated and improved in their work. On the other hand, the current older generation of teachers and agricultural scientific workers should also be given more and broader opportunities to provide them with good working environmental conditions, and when necessary, they can go to the places they need to conduct investigations, research, visits or studies. Because, as long as they are old teachers and old technicians who strive for progress, they can learn modestly. After learning, their professional level will be improved, and they will play a greater role in their work. Moreover, the effect of learning is easy to expand through them. In the past, I did not do enough in this regard in my work, and I will work hard to improve it in the future.

Secondly, in terms of carrying out scientific research work, at present, national higher agricultural colleges and universities have a relatively large force of manpower. I believe that the reason why manpower cannot be fully liberated to engage in scientific research work is because teachers who are opening new courses and opening new courses spend too much effort in compiling teaching materials. In fact, each school compiles teaching materials for the same course, and the manpower is scattered, and it is not necessarily possible to write them completely and wonderfully. Now the Higher Education Department has begun to invite teachers to compile textbooks for each course separately. If the compilation and publication of these textbooks can be completed earlier, more manpower can be freed up earlier to do scientific research work.

In addition, in terms of assistants, business departments also need to solve the problem. I think it is best for schools and business departments to sign long-term cooperation and funding and manpower subsidy contracts for a certain scientific research topic. The assistants equipped by the business departments may adopt a few years of rotation. This can not only train cadres for the business departments and improve their cadre quality, but also increase the number of intermediate and junior assistants in scientific research work for the schools. This is a good way to tap the potential power of teachers in colleges and universities to engage in scientific research work.

3. We must learn to use the materialist dialectical method, with a creative spirit, to engage in agricultural scientific research and improve agricultural production.

In the past, we received semi-colonial scientific education, and in agricultural scientific research work, we were highly dependent and lacked creativity. We only did what capitalist countries had done. At the beginning of liberation, we did not learn enough from the Soviet Union's agricultural scientific research, and for a time, we dared not let go of our original research work before we figured out the Soviet approach.

For example, the utilization of maize inbred lines was already beginning to be applied in production in the Soviet Union at that time. However, because we learned Darwinism, Darwin cited the degradation phenomenon after self-fertilization of organisms, so we also believed that maize inbred lines were not enough to increase production through subsequent hybridization. As a result, in some places, the inbred line work that had been done with hope was stopped.

For another example, before liberation, some scientific research institutions imitated the methods of Britain and the United States, using chemical agents to treat plant seeds to induce variation. After liberation, because of the ideological concerns of scientific researchers! And stopped doing it. In some individual locations, where this material was continued to be propagated in small quantities to preserve seeds, incidents of shoveling out seedlings also occurred. This kind of rude behavior in academia has been stopped by higher-level governments at any time. In fact, this research is still being published in Soviet biological science journals, which shows that this work has not been abolished in the Soviet Union.

At the end of last year, the Soviet scientists' delegation to China conveyed the report of the Geneva International Conference on the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy. Professor Kuzin cited the example of barley and wheat that had been formed into economically valuable varieties by irradiation with radioactive substances. Professor Kuzin said in the group discussion: This kind of variation can only be produced after irradiation with radioactive substances, and cannot be obtained by general selection and hybridization methods. However, we also did work on irradiating plant seeds with X-rays and radium to induce variation before liberation. However, after liberation, we also gave up this type of research.

From the above three examples, although we also often talk about using the materialist dialectical method in scientific research work, when faced with practical problems, we often form a situation of only caring about the present, shrinking back, and failing to creatively adhere to scientific research, so that it can play a role in production. This requires our scientific workers to thoroughly break this ideological barrier, adhere to scientific research work with a creative spirit, and rapidly reach the world's advanced level in more than ten years to realize Chairman Mao's great call.

In order to be able to do a good job in agricultural science and technology in the future, I will strengthen the study of political theory. In accordance with the instructions of Vice Chairman Guo Moruo: we must regularly reflect on ourselves in terms of service attitude, unity and learning. We must also use the standards of Communist Party members to demand ourselves, so that we can better complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the government, so as to be worthy of the glorious title of intellectuals in New China!

    吴绍騤的发言
    主席，各位委员：
    我在河南省从事农业教育和试验研究工作，这次能列席政协会议，感到非常光荣！听了周总理和各位首长的报告，更明确了今后工作的方向。我衷心拥护，并在自己的工作岗位中加以贯彻执行。现在乘大会发言的机会，提供我个人的一些意见，请各位委员及同志们加以指正。
    1、全国农业发展纲要40条给我以莫大鼓舞，我们有决心完成任务。
    这次党中央所提出的全国农业发展纲要40条，是经毛主席亲自指导和分析研究之后拟定出来的。它是具有保证完成任务的物质基础。因为农业合作化从初级转到高级之后，农民们生产的劲头更大了，这就是完成40条纲要上所提出的任务最有力的保证。此外，再加上水利化、农业技术改革等等的措施，于是保证更切实了。以河南为例，解放以来，在农业生产战线上已取得很大的成绩。去年中央提出发展高产作物的号召，在河南也收到很大的效果。另外如棉花增产方面，自从去冬新疆派出劳模及讲师到河南省来传授提托夫专家的植棉技术之后，使河南省的棉农和科技工作人员学得了一套新的棉花增产技术措施，从而在会后有些棉区的生产合作社订出了千亩千斤的棉花丰产计划。现在河南全省农民在当地的党政领导和技术指导下，正在轰轰烈烈地变冬闲为冬忙，从事各种迎接今年大生产的准备工作。去年河南省已经超额完成了1957年的粮食生产指标。今年1月召开的省农业劳模会上，可以看出在去年的农业生产中涌现出了许多大面积丰产的事迹。这都是由于在党和政府的领导下，农民们发挥了生产积极性的光辉成就。自然，这也是与知识分子的农业科技人员在技术指导上贡献出力量分不开的。所以，我相信这四十条纲要不但能完成，而且能超额完成的。我也愿意和其他的农业科技工作者一道，从事这个伟大的事业。
    2、加强农业科学研究工作，以迎接生产高潮的来临。
    紧接着合作化高潮而来的便是生产高潮的到来。今年河南省的农业劳模会上，很突出地表现农民们要科学，要技术。我们的科学水平不高，而科技人材的数量也有限，很难以应付这种澎湃发展中的农业生产上的要求的。我十分相信只有在党的统一领导下，才能形成力量，以向科学进军，解决生产上的问题；同时，科学研究的成果，才能真正地在国民经济上发挥作用。
    解放以来，在党和政府的领导下已经培养出来不少的青年农业科学工作者。他们在农业生产、农业教育和科学研究工作中起到一定的作用。这是新生的力量，非常可爱和珍贵，应当对他们在工作中继续加以培养提高。另一方面，对于当前的老一辈教师和农业科学工作者，也要同样给予他们以更多的和更广泛的机会，以使他们有好的工作环境条件，并在必要时能到所需要到的地方，以进行调查研究、访问或学习。因为，只要是力求进步的老教师、老技术人员，他们是能够虚心学习的。经过了学习之后，他们的业务水平提高，在工作岗位上将发生很大的作用。而且学习的效果，也易于通过他们扩大影响。以往在我的工作岗位上，对于这点做的是很不够的，今后要加以努力。
    其次在开展科学研究工作方面，目前全国高等农业院校是拥有比较大的一股人力的。人力不能充分地解放出来以从事科研工作的原因，我以为是由于新开课和开新课的教师在编写讲义上花费了太多的功夫之故。其实各校都编写同一课程的讲义，人力分散，也未必都能写的完备精采。现在高等教育部已在着手约请教师分别编写各课程的课本，如能提早完成这些课本的编写印行，就可以及早地腾出较多的人力来做科学研究工作。
    另外，在助手方面，也需要业务部门加以解决。我以为最好由学校和业务部门订立对某项科研题目的长期合作和经费人力补助的合同，由业务部门配备的助手，不妨采用几年轮调的办法。这样既能为业务部门培养干部，提高他们的干部质量，又为学校增加了科研工作中的中下级助手。这是发挥高等学校教师从事科研工作潜在力量的一个好办法。
    3、要学会运用唯物辩证方法，以创造性的精神，来从事农业科学研究，提高农业生产。
    以往我们受了半殖民地的科学教育，在农业科学研究工作上，依赖性大，创造性少。凡是资本主义国家做过的，我们才照着做。解放之初，对于苏联的农业科学研究学习的不够，一时形成为在没有摸清苏联的做法之前，我们原有的研究工作不敢放手做去。
    譬如，玉米自交系的利用问题，当时在苏联已经开始在生产上应用。而我们因为学习了达尔文主义，达尔文举出了生物自交后的退化现象，于是我们也认为玉米自交系不足以通过后来的杂交而增产。以至，在有些地方，把已经做有希望的自交系工作停止下来。
    又如，解放之前，有些科学研究机关，曾仿效英美的办法，用药剂处理植物种子，以引起变异。解放之后，因为科研工作者的思想顾虑！而停止不做。其中个别地点对这种材料继续少量繁殖，以保存种子的，也曾发生铲除幼苗的事件。此种对学术上的粗暴行为，已经上级政府随时予以制止。其实这种研究，在苏联的生物科学杂志上仍有文章发表，可见在苏联并不是对这种工作废止不做的。
    去年年底苏联科学家访华代表团来我国传达日内瓦和平利用原子能国际会议的报告中，库津教授举出因用放射性物质照射而形成了有经济利用价值的大麦和小麦的事例。库津教授在小组讨论时曾说：这种变异只有经过放射性物质照射之后才可产生，不是一般的选种和杂交方法所能获得的。但是我们也有在解放前曾做过用X光及镭照射植物种子引起变异的工作的。可是在解放之后也放弃此类研究工作不做了。
    从以上的三个事例看来，虽然我们也经常谈到在科学研究工作上要运用唯物辩证方法，但是面临到实际问题的时候，常常是形成只顾眼前，缩手缩脚，而不能创造性地坚持科学研究，使在生产上起到作用。这就要求我们科学工作者必须彻底打破这种思想障碍，以创造性的精神，坚持科学研究工作，才能在十几年内迅速达到世界的先进水平，以实现毛主席的伟大号召。
    为使能够做好今后的农业科学技术工作，我要加强政治理论学习。遵照郭沫若副主席所指示的：要经常就服务态度、团结和学习三方面，对自己加以反省。更要用共产党员的标准来要求自己，使自己更好地完成党和政府所交给的任务，以无愧于新中国知识分子的光荣称号！
