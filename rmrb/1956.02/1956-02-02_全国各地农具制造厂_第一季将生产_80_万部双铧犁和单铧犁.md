    Farm Implement Factories Across the Country
    To Produce 800,000 Double-Share and Single-Share Plows in the First Quarter
    (Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch) Farm implement factories across the country will produce 800,000 double-wheeled double-share plows and double-wheeled single-share plows in the first quarter of this year to meet the needs of farmers for spring plowing and production. This figure is an increase of 500,000 units compared to the number of double-wheeled double-share plows and double-wheeled single-share plows assigned to farm implement factories across the country for production at the National Farm Implement Professional Conference convened by the Third Ministry of Machine Building last year.
    These 800,000 double-wheeled double-share plows and double-wheeled single-share plows will be produced before the end of March. After this batch of farm implements is put into spring plowing, it can enable more than 100 million mu of land to be deeply plowed.
    In order to ensure the completion of production tasks with quality and quantity, the Party and government leaders of the relevant provinces and cities have given full attention to this task, personally taking action to organize production and supervise inspections. Steel mills under the Ministry of Heavy Industry are intensifying the production of steel for farm implements; the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications have also notified railway and transportation departments across the country to give priority and convenience to the transportation of farm implements and materials for farm implements, transporting them as soon as they arrive. The First Ministry of Machine Building, the Third Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Committee of the First National Machinery Industry Trade Union of China, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives have dispatched three working groups to Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin and other places to supervise and inspect the production of double-wheeled double-share plows and double-wheeled single-share plows.

    全国各地农具制造厂
    第一季将生产80万部双铧犁和单铧犁
    据新华社1日讯　全国各地农具制造厂今年第一季度将生产80万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁，供应农民春耕生产需用。这一数字，比去年第三机械工业部召开的全国农具专业会议上布置各地农具制造厂生产双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁的数字，增加了50万部。
    这80万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁将在3月底前生产出来。这批农具投入春耕以后，可以使1亿多亩土地达到深耕。
    为保证按质、按量完成生产任务，各有关省市党政领导方面都予以充分重视，亲自动手，组织生产和督促检查。重工业部所属各钢厂正突击增产农具用的钢材；铁道部、交通部也已通知全国铁路交通部门，对农具和农具用材料的运输，随到随运，给以优先便利。第一机械工业部、第三机械工业部、农业部、中国第一机械工会全国委员会和全国供销合作总社等单位，已经派出3个工作组分头到上海、天津、江苏、安徽、山东、河南、湖北、河北、山西、辽宁、吉林等地督促检查双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁的生产。
