    Should Produce High-Quality Newsprint
    (I)
    Editor:
    Since the "Anhui Daily" switched to horizontal typesetting, the font size has been increased, and more pictures have been added. Readers welcome these improvements to the newspaper, but they have also raised a concern: Why are the pictures in the newspaper always printed blurry, like a "blackboard newspaper"?
    Initially, we thought this was a problem with plate-making and printing, and we made efforts to improve in these areas. However, it has been proven that our copper plates are not bad, and the printing conditions are also good; the problem lies in the poor quality of the paper. Under the same printing conditions, the pictures in magazines printed with Soviet newsprint are very clear, but the pictures printed with some domestically produced paper are blurry. Indeed, the quality of some domestically produced paper is relatively poor. For example, the newsprint produced by the Jiaxing "Liyong Factory" that we use in our printing plant is too thin and has poor ink absorption; the newsprint produced by the Guangdong Paper Mill has a rough and lackluster surface, and the thickness is uneven. We have examined the "Xinhua Daily" of Jiangsu, the "Dazhong Daily" of Shandong, the "Zhejiang Daily," and the "Fujian Daily," and their newspapers have the same problem with their pictures.
    In order to change this phenomenon, in addition to further improving printing technology, we also request that the staff of all state-owned, jointly state-private owned paper mills strive to improve papermaking technology, improve product quality, and produce more, better, and cheaper newsprint to supply to the newspaper offices. Let the newspaper offices print more clearly printed, innovative in content, and lively in form newspapers to meet the needs of the broad masses of readers.

    Editor:
    We are staff members of the "Yunnan Youth Daily" newspaper. We want to expose the serious situation of the Yunfeng Paper Mill's low product quality.
    According to state regulations, in order to avoid long-distance transportation and coordinate production, newspapers in Yunnan Province should use "Yunfeng newsprint" produced by the Yunfeng Paper Mill. However, newspapers printed with "Yunfeng newsprint" have blurry fonts that are difficult to read. There are many reader complaints. Therefore, our newspaper usually does not dare to use photographs, even though Xinhua News Agency often sends us many very good photographs; whenever we need to publish picture magazines for festivals, we have to reluctantly spend twice as much money to buy Chongqing newsprint on the market.
    Recently, the "Yunnan Daily" switched to rotary press printing. Because the Yunfeng Paper Mill cannot produce roll paper, it has switched to using roll paper from the Sichuan 602 Paper Mill. The quality of the Sichuan 602 Paper Mill's products used to be very poor, almost the same as "Yunfeng newsprint," but has recently improved greatly, and the printing quality of the "Yunnan Daily" is now very good. Why has the Yunfeng Paper Mill consistently failed to improve its product quality?

    应该生产质量优良的新闻纸
    （一）
    编辑同志：
    “安徽日报”在改为横排以后，字体放大了，图片增多了。读者对报纸这种改进表示欢迎，但是他们又提出了一个意见：为什么报上的图片总是印得模糊不清，成了“黑板报”呢？
    起先，我们以为这是制版、印刷上的问题，曾经在这些方面努力加以改进。但是事实证明，我们制出的铜版并不坏，印刷条件也不错；问题在于纸张质量不好。在同样的印刷条件下，用苏联的新闻用纸印的画刊画面就很清楚，但是用某些国产纸印的图片就模糊不清。的确，有一部分国产纸的质量是比较差的，像我们印刷厂里用的嘉兴“利用厂”出产的新闻用纸就太薄，而且吸墨性能差；广东造纸厂出产的新闻用纸纸面粗糙而欠光彩，厚薄又不均匀。我们查看了江苏“新华日报”、山东“大众日报”、“浙江日报”和“福建日报”，它们报纸上的图片也有同样的毛病。
    为了改变这种现象，我们除了进一步改进印刷技术以外，还要求各国营、公私合营造纸厂的职工，努力改进造纸技术，提高产品质量，生产更多、更好、更便宜的新闻用纸供给报社。让报社印出更多的印刷清晰、内容新颖、形式活泼的报纸，满足广大读者的需要。

    我们是“云南青年报”社的工作人员。我们要揭发云丰造纸厂产品质量低劣的严重情形。
    按照国家的规定，为了避免长途运输，统筹生产，云南省的报纸都应该用云丰造纸厂出产的“云丰新闻纸”。但是，用“云丰新闻纸”印出来的报纸，字体模糊，看不清楚。读者意见很多。因此，我们的报纸平常不大敢用照片，虽然新华社经常寄给我们很多很好的照片；每逢节日要出画刊，就不得不忍痛拿出双倍的钱到市场上去买重庆的新闻纸。
    最近“云南日报”改用轮转机印刷，由于云丰造纸厂造不出卷筒纸，因此就改用四川六○二造纸厂的卷筒纸。四川六○二造纸厂的产品过去质量也很坏，同“云丰新闻纸”差不多，但是近来改进很大，“云南日报”的印刷质量就很好。为什么云丰造纸厂对产品质量却一直不加改进呢？
