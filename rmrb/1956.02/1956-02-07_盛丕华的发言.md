Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

	I fully agree with and support the political report by Chairman Zhou Enlai, the reports by Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, and Dong Biwu, and the report by Committee Member Chen Boda.

	Under the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and influenced by the high tide of agricultural cooperation nationwide, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved tremendous success at a leaping pace across the country. This is a great victory for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's peaceful transformation policy.

	The implementation of full public-private partnership by industry is a decisive step in the process of socialist transformation for us industrialists and businessmen. We have taken this historically significant step with incomparable excitement and joy. We thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their education, the working class for their supervision, and all sectors of society for their help. Our national industrialists and businessmen generally possess a patriotic tradition. Facing the leaping progress of socialist construction in the motherland, every patriotic industrialist and businessman is eager to contribute to the great construction cause of the motherland. We must translate the high enthusiasm for public-private partnership into our future work, and specifically implement and earnestly fulfill our guarantee to Chairman Mao in practical actions: We will definitely obey leadership, be dutiful and responsible, and manage production and operation well; we will definitely strengthen our study and better transform our thinking; we will definitely strive to learn skills, learn socialist management methods, and transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers.

	The implementation of full public-private partnership by industry is only a beginning for further in-depth transformation. Although, under the leadership and education of the Party and the government, our industrialists and businessmen have made significant progress in their ideological understanding over the past few years; especially recently, after studying Chairman Mao's instructions on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, more and more people have begun to understand the principle of mastering their own destiny, recognize the shamefulness of exploitation, and greatly strengthened their confidence and determination to strive for transformation. However, due to the deep-rooted nature of our capitalist ideology and the arduous nature of ideological transformation, we are still lagging behind the development of the objective situation to varying degrees. In this high tide of public-private partnership, everyone has shown high enthusiasm for accepting transformation, but this does not mean that their thinking has been completely transformed. With the full implementation of public-private partnership and the fixed interest rate system for capitalist industry and commerce, the capitalist relations of production have undergone fundamental changes. We are now half public people, and to further become public people is an arduous process of self-transformation. Chairman Zhou's instructions on the transformation of intellectuals said: "We hope that intellectuals in our country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, can adopt self-education methods and gradually grow into intellectuals who serve socialism wholeheartedly through three interconnected paths: observation and practice of social life, practice of their profession, and study of Marxist-Leninist theory." This is also fully applicable in essence to us industrialists and businessmen, especially to the backbone members of the business community. We industrialists and businessmen, especially backbone members, must, after the enterprises are incorporated into public-private partnership, learn from the public representatives and outstanding workers in the enterprise through these three paths indicated by Chairman Zhou, and gradually transform ourselves into working people of socialist society.

	The great plan of the National Agricultural Development Program points out a bright and splendid future for the development of agricultural production and rural work in our country. Chairman Mao instructed us: All work other than agriculture must also catch up quickly to adapt to the new situation of the high tide of the socialist revolution. We industrialists and businessmen must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and, together with the people of the whole country, go all out and catch up quickly. We firmly believe that as long as we rely closely on the leadership of the Party, we will definitely be able to basically and victoriously complete the great cause of the socialist revolution in the next three years.

	When we have now won the great victory of socialist construction and socialist transformation and have happily entered socialist society together with the people of the whole country, on the one hand, we must always be vigilant to prevent the conspiracies and sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries; on the other hand, we cannot but miss the industrial and commercial circles and all the compatriots in Taiwan who are still in deep waters. Taiwan is a part of our country's territory, Taiwan must be liberated, and it will surely be liberated. In the past, some members of the industrial and commercial circles were influenced by the enemy's malicious propaganda, left the mainland, and ran to Taiwan, suffering today's dark and hopeless situation. We fully believe that the industrial and commercial circles and all compatriots in Taiwan love the motherland and hope that the motherland will become prosperous and strong. The brilliant achievements of socialist construction in the motherland and the unprecedented improvement of its international status have become undeniable facts. We industrialists and businessmen on the mainland deeply feel the glory and happiness of being a people of the new China. Chairman Zhou, in his political report, represented the entire people of the motherland in expressing his cordial concern for the compatriots in Taiwan. We earnestly hope that the compatriots in Taiwan, who have a long revolutionary tradition, can return to the embrace of the motherland's family as soon as possible. All those who have been poisoned by reactionary propaganda and have fled from the mainland to Taiwan, hope to eliminate their concerns and, together with us, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strive for the liberation of Taiwan, the complete unification of the motherland, and a common journey to the bright future of a prosperous and happy socialism.

	I wish the conference a complete success! I wish you all good health!

    盛丕华的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来主席的政治报告、李济深副主席、郭沫若副主席、陈叔通副主席、董必武副主席和陈伯达委员的各项报告。
    在党中央和毛主席的关怀之下，和在全国农业合作化高潮的影响之下，资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，以飞跃的速度，在全国范围内获得巨大的成就，这是中国共产党和毛主席和平改造政策的伟大胜利。
    在一切私营企业中实行按行业的全部公私合营，这是我们工商业者接受社会主义改造过程中具有决定意义的一个步骤。我们在无比兴奋愉快的心情下跨过了这具有伟大历史意义的一步。我们感谢党和毛主席对我们的教育，感谢工人阶级对我们的督促，感谢各方面的社会力量对我们的帮助。我们民族工商业者一般都具有热爱祖国的传统精神，面对着祖国社会主义建设的飞跃前进，每一个爱国的工商业者都是热望能为祖国的伟大建设事业尽一份力量。我们一定要把争取公私合营的高度热情贯彻到今后工作中去，在实际行动中具体贯彻和切实做到我们向毛主席提出的保证：一定服从领导，守职尽责，搞好生产经营；一定加强学习，更好地改造我们的思想；一定努力学会本领，学会社会主义经营管理方法，改造自己成为自食其力的劳动者。
    在一切私营企业中实行按行业的全部公私合营，对于进一步深入改造，还只是一个开始。虽然，几年来，在党和政府的领导教育下，我们工商业者的思想认识有了显著的进步；特别是最近在学习了毛主席关于资本主义工商业社会主义改造的指示以后，越来越多的人开始懂得了掌握自己命运的道理，认识到剥削的可耻，大大地加强了争取改造的信心和决心。但是由于我们资本主义思想意识的根深蒂固，而思想改造又是一个艰巨的斗争，因此，在各种不同程度上，还是跟不上客观形势的发展。在这次公私合营的高潮中，大家表现了接受改造的高度热情，但这并不等于思想已经完全得到改造。随着资本主义工商业全部实行公私合营和定息办法的推行，资本主义生产关系已经起了根本性质的变化。我们现在是半公家人，要进一步成为公家人，这是一个艰巨的自我改造的过程。周主席对知识分子的改造指示说：“我们希望，我国知识分子能够在中国共产党的领导下，采取自我教育的方法，通过社会生活的观察和实践、业务的实践和马克思列宁主义理论的学习这样三个互相联系的途径，逐步地成长为全心全意地为社会主义服务的知识分子”。这对于我们工商业者特别是对于工商界中的骨干分子来说，在实质上也是完全适用的。我们工商业者特别是骨干分子必须在企业纳入公私合营后，通过周主席所指示的这样三个途径向企业中的公方代表和职工群众中优秀工作者看齐，逐步地把自己改造成为社会主义社会的劳动人民。
    全国农业发展纲要的伟大规划给我国农业生产和农村工作的发展指出了一个光明灿烂的远景。毛主席指示我们：农业以外的各项工作，也都必须迅速赶上，以适应社会主义革命高潮的新形势。我们工商业者一定要遵照毛主席的指示，和全国人民一道，全力以赴，迅速赶上。我们坚决相信：只要紧紧依靠党的领导，一定能够在今后三年的时间内，基本上胜利完成社会主义革命的伟大事业。
    当我们现在获得了社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的伟大胜利和全国人民一道，幸福地进入社会主义社会的时候，一方面我们还要经常提高警惕，防止反革命分子的阴谋破坏活动，另一方面，我们不能不怀念至今还处在水深火热中的台湾工商界和全体台湾同胞。台湾是我国领土的一部分，台湾必须解放，也一定会得到解放。过去一部分工商界受了敌人恶意宣传的影响，离开了大陆，跑到了台湾，遭到今天的暗无天日的处境。我们完全相信台湾的工商界和全体同胞都是热爱祖国、期望祖国兴盛富强的，祖国社会主义建设的辉煌成就，国际地位的空前提高已成为无可置辩的事实。我们大陆上的工商业者深深感到作为一个新中国人民的光荣和幸福。周主席在政治报告中代表祖国全体人民表示对台湾同胞亲切关怀，我们殷切地希望具有悠久革命传统的台湾同胞能够早日回到祖国大家庭的怀抱中来。一切过去受到反动派恶毒宣传以致从大陆上跑到台湾去的人们，希望消除顾虑，和我们一道，在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为解放台湾、实现祖国的完全统一、共同奔赴繁荣幸福的社会主义的光明前途而努力。
    祝会议胜利成功！各位身体健康！
