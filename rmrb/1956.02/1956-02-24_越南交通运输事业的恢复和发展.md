    The Restoration and Development of Vietnam's Transportation Industry
    By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam
    "Look, our airplane!" On the morning of January 9, 1956, the first airplane painted with the golden star red flag emblem appeared over Hanoi. The Vietnamese people enthusiastically celebrated the birth of their country's civil aviation industry.
    From then on, on the map marking the transportation network radiating in all directions from Hanoi, in addition to the red road lines, black railway lines, and blue waterway transportation lines, there would be a new line of a different color – the air transportation line.
    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attaches great importance to the transportation industry. Although conditions were very difficult due to long-term war damage, thanks to the active leadership of the democratic government and the enthusiastic support of the people, the transportation industry in North Vietnam has made significant progress in restoration and development over the past short year and a half.
    According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport and Post and Telecommunications of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, by the end of last year, a total of 443 kilometers of railways had been repaired and opened to traffic, accounting for more than one-third of the original 1,150 kilometers before the war; a total of 6,330 kilometers of highways had been repaired and expanded, most of which were paved with various road surfaces, an increase of 7.5% compared with before the war; most of the original inland waterways in the North had resumed navigation; coastal routes nearly a thousand kilometers long are being actively restored, and seaports such as Haiphong and Ben Thuy have also undergone preliminary dredging and expansion; the restoration of postal and telecommunications services has also progressed rapidly, and equipment has been greatly improved compared with before the war.
    The rapid restoration of the transportation industry has not only strongly supported the arduous tasks of restoring the national economy in North Vietnam after the war, but has also greatly enlivened the people's economic life. In 1955 alone, railways in North Vietnam transported more than 400,000 tons of goods, over 41 million ton-kilometers, and transported more than 3 million passengers, over 140 million passenger-kilometers; in the North, hundreds of long-distance buses and trucks run on dozens of highways every day, and a total of more than 460,000 tons of goods were transported by automobiles to various places last year; waterway transportation is also very busy, and from the ceasefire to September last year, various ships on inland rivers transported about 500,000 tons of goods, and the port of Haiphong handled 160,000 tons of goods in the six months after liberation. Among the huge amounts of goods transported by various means of transportation, in addition to various construction materials, raw materials, fuels, agricultural tools, seeds, chemical fertilizers, and draught cattle for the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production, there are also various bulk goods for the needs of people's daily life and for export.
    With the restoration and development of the transportation industry, the state of division caused by the long-term war has gradually disappeared, and urban-rural and internal-external exchanges are becoming increasingly frequent, which makes it easier for state-owned trade to regulate surpluses and shortages in a timely manner and effectively balance prices. The Hanoi market, which plays the role of an exchange center, clearly reflects this situation. Comparing the third quarter of 1955 with the previous quarter alone, the amount of cloth transported from Hanoi to various places increased threefold, kerosene increased twofold, and paper increased sixfold, while the amount of live pigs and chickens and ducks transported to Hanoi from various places increased threefold and fivefold, respectively. In 1955, the amount of tea exported from Hanoi to foreign countries increased by 30% compared with 1954, timber increased by 200%, coffee increased by 300%, beans increased by 650%, peanuts increased by 720%, and handicrafts increased by 15 times. Imported from socialist and people's democratic countries are various hardware construction materials, fuel oil, cloth, and general merchandise for restoring production and daily use. Due to the rapid development of urban-rural and internal-external exchanges, since the liberation of Hanoi, the prices of goods in North Vietnam, especially the prices of daily necessities for the people, have remained stable, except for a few French goods and goods from the South blockaded by Ngo Dinh Diem. At the time of Hanoi's liberation, rice was 380 yuan (Vietnamese currency) per kilogram, and now it is 400 yuan, with basically no change.
    Just like blood vessels in the human body, wherever transportation lines extend, various production undertakings that have been devastated by the war are immediately revitalized and develop vigorously. New villages and towns have appeared along the transportation lines. By the end of 1955, the number of small industrial and handicraft production units in North Vietnam had developed to more than 50,000, and the fishing and salt industries in the 12 coastal provinces had also been largely restored, while the restoration and development of the forestry and local products industries were particularly significant. In 1955, the income of the people of the Northwest Thai-Miao Autonomous Region from forestry and local products alone was nearly 600 million Vietnamese currency.
    In order to meet the needs of rapidly restoring and developing agricultural and industrial production and improving people's lives, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has decided to further vigorously restore and develop transportation, postal and telecommunications services in 1956, and the state's investment in this area will account for 23% of the total construction investment. According to the provisions of the "1956 National Plan," in addition to the need to vigorously restore, consolidate, and expand railways, highways, and river transportation, coastal shipping will also be restored and civil aviation transportation will be opened this year.

    越南交通运输事业的恢复和发展
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    “看，我们的飞机！”1956年1月9日上午，河内上空出现了第一架涂漆着金星红旗徽号的飞机，越南人民热烈欢呼自己祖国民用航空事业的诞生。
    从此，标志着以河内为中心、向四面八方幅射的交通运输网的地图上，除了红色的公路线、黑色的铁路线、蓝色的水路运输线以外，还要增加一条别的颜色的新线——航空运输线。
    越南民主共和国政府十分重视交通运输事业。虽然经过长期战争的破坏，条件非常困难，但是由于民主政府积极的领导和人民群众热情的支援，在过去短短一年多的时间里，越南北方的交通运输事业已经得到了长足的恢复和发展。
    据越南民主共和国交通邮电部的统计，到去年年底为止，已经修复通车的铁路共有443公里，占战前原有1，150多公里铁路的三分之一以上；已经修复和扩建通车的公路共有6，330多公里，大部都铺设了各种路面，比战前增加了7.5％；北方原有内河航线已经大部恢复了航运；沿海近千公里长的航线正积极恢复中，海防、边水等海港也都作了初步的疏浚和扩建；邮电的恢复工作也进展得很快，设备比战前有了很大的改善。
    交通运输业的迅速恢复，不仅有力地支持了越南北方战后恢复国民经济的各项繁重的任务，而且也大大地活跃了人民的经济生活。在1955年一年里，越南北方经过铁路载运的货物共40多万吨、4，100多万吨公里，载运的旅客共300多万人、1亿4千多万人公里；在北方，每天都有成百辆长途客车和货车在几十条公路上行驶，去年由汽车载运到各地的货物共有46万多吨；水路运输也很繁忙，自停战到去年9月，经过内河各种船只载运的货物约有50多万吨，海防港口解放后半年间就吞吐了16万吨货物。在这些经过各种交通工具载运的巨量货物里面，除了供应恢复和发展工业、农业生产的各种建设器材、原料、燃料、农具、种籽、化学肥料和耕牛等外，还有供应人民日常生活需要以及供应出口需要的各种大宗物品。
    随着交通运输业的恢复和发展，过去长期战争所造成的分割状态逐渐消失了，城乡交流和内外交流日益频繁，这样使得国营贸易便于及时地调节有无和有效地平衡物价。起着交流中心作用的河内市场明显地反映了这种情况。仅以1955年第三季度同前一季度比较，自河内输往各地的布匹就增加了三倍、煤油增加了两倍、纸张增加了六倍，而自各地运到河内的生猪增加了三倍、鸡鸭增加了五倍。1955年经由河内向国外输出的茶叶比1954年增加了30％、木材增加了200％、咖啡增加了300％、豆类增加了650％、花生增加了720％、手工艺品增加了15倍。自社会主义和人民民主国家运进来的是各种供恢复生产和人民日用的五金建设器材、燃料油、布匹和百货等。由于城乡交流和内外交流的迅速开展，自河内解放后一年多来，除少数几种法国货和受吴庭艳封锁的南方货物以外，越南北方的物价、特别是人民日用必需品的价格，始终都很平稳。河内解放时，大米1公斤380元（越币），现在400元，基本上没有什么变动。
    就像是人身上的血管似的，交通运输线伸展到那里，那里遭受战争摧残的各种生产事业立即恢复了生机，蓬勃地发展起来了。沿着交通运输线出现了一座座新的村庄和市镇。到1955年年底为止，越南北方的小型工业和手工业生产单位已经发展到5万多个，沿海12省的渔业和盬业也都大部恢复了，而林土产业的恢复和发展尤其显著。1955年西北泰族苗族自治区人民仅林土产一项的收入就将近越币6亿元。
    为了适应迅速恢复和发展农、工业生产和改善人民生活的需要，越南民主共和国政府决定在1956年更进一步大力恢复和发展交通邮电事业，国家用在这方面的资金将占全部建设投资的23％。按照“1956年国家计划”的规定，除了铁路、公路、河运需要大力恢复、加固和扩展外，今年还要恢复沿海航运和开辟民用航空运输事业。
