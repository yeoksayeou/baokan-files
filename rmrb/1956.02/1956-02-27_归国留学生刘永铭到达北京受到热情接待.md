Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Liu Yongming, a former Chinese student who was detained in an American mental hospital for six years before returning to the motherland, arrived in Beijing this morning with his wife and brother. He was welcomed at the Qianmen Railway Station by Ai Dayan, Director of the Student Management Department of the Ministry of Higher Education, and Ji Feng, a representative of the Chinese Red Cross Society.

After arriving in Beijing, Liu Yongming and his party immediately traveled by car to the Ministry of Higher Education's student guesthouse, where a comfortable suite of rooms had been prepared for them. As soon as Liu Yongming and his wife arrived at the guesthouse, they were surrounded by other returned students, who warmly congratulated Liu Yongming and his relatives on their reunion after a long separation.

A representative of the Ministry of Higher Education told Liu Yongming's wife, Gui Qionghua, that the Ministry of Higher Education had invited medical experts from the capital to conduct a thorough examination of his health and to make appropriate arrangements for his further recuperation. Liu Yongming's brother, Dr. Liu Yongchang, said that Liu Yongming's mental condition had greatly improved since returning to the motherland.

In the afternoon of the same day, other students who had recently broken through the numerous obstacles imposed by the American authorities to return to the motherland held a tea party to welcome Liu Yongming and his wife.

Liu Yongming returned to the motherland in early February after Wang Bingnan, China's ambassador, and the Chinese Red Cross Society demanded that the United States release him.

For the past three weeks, Liu Yongming has toured Guangzhou and Shanghai and spent the Spring Festival with his family in Shanghai.

    刘永铭等一行抵达北京后，随即乘车赴高等教育部留学生招待所，那里已经为他们准备好一套舒适的房间。刘永铭和他的妻子一到招待所，就被其他归国的留学生包围起来，他们为刘永铭和他的亲人的久别重逢表示热烈的祝贺。
    高等教育部的一位代表对刘永铭的妻子桂琼华说，高等教育部已经邀请得首都的医学专家来对他的健康状况作一次彻底的检查，并为他的进一步疗养加以适当的安排。刘永铭的弟弟刘永錩医师说，自从回到祖国以后，刘永铭的精神状况已经大有改进。
