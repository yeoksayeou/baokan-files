Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 4th (TASS dispatch)　American newspapers are commenting on the letters exchanged between Bulganin and Eisenhower. The newspapers point out that Washington is carefully studying the second letter and is preparing a reply.

It is noteworthy that while the American authorities have not yet expressed their opinion on Bulganin's letter, some American newspapers have proposed rejecting the suggestions made in the letter, but they cannot offer any reason for doing so.

At the same time, many newspapers and observers believe that an unfavorable response to Bulganin's letter would damage the position of the United States and its allies. "New York Times" correspondent in Washington, Ebel, is concerned that if the United States gives a negative reply, it will bear the responsibility for "no progress" in resolving the disputes between East and West. Ebel wrote that, according to some American officials, it is now time for the United States to show initiative in disarmament. He wrote that if it merely insists on the "open skies" plan, then "the government is very likely to be accused of only wanting to inspect and not wanting to disarm."

    美报评布尔加宁第二封信
    新华社据塔斯社纽约4日讯　美国报纸评论布尔加宁和艾森豪威尔交换的信件。报纸指出，华盛顿正在仔细地研究第二封来信，并且准备答复。
    值得注意的是，在美国官方还没有对布尔加宁的信件表示意见的时候，美国某些报纸却提议拒绝信中所提出的建议，但是它们又提不出任何理由。
    同时，有很多报纸和观察家认为，如果对布尔加宁的信件作不赞成的答复，会给美国和它的盟国的地位造成损失。“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者艾伯尔耽心，如果美国给以否定的答复，它就要负在解决东西方之间的纠纷上“没有进展”的责任。艾伯尔写道，根据美国一些官方人士的意见，现在已经到美国必须在裁军方面表示主动精神的时候了。他写道，如果单单坚持“开放天空”的计划，那么“政府就完全可能受到这样的指责，说它只想视察而不想裁军”。
