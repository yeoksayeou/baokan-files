    Beijing Held Victory Cup City Race Yesterday
    On the morning of February 15th, 1,450 male long-distance runners from factories, schools, government offices, and other work posts, wearing various styles and colors of sportswear, were jumping around in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. They were waiting for the start of the "1956 Beijing Victory Cup City Race" jointly organized by People's Daily, Guangming Daily, Workers' Daily, China Youth Daily, New Sports Magazine, Beijing Daily, and Beijing Youth.
    As the starting gun fired, the athletes, led by 3 motorcycles, dashed west from Tiananmen Square. They followed the circular tram tracks, passed through Xidan, Xisi, Pinganli, and then headed east past the back gate of Beihai Park and Tieshizi Hutong, before heading south through Dongsi and Dongdan, and returning to the original starting point at Tiananmen. Pedestrians along the route stopped to watch and applauded the athletes. Many grandmothers also watched from their doorsteps with their children. There were also cheering stations and cheering vehicles along the route, beating gongs and drums to "cheer" the athletes on and congratulate them on completing the race and achieving victory.
    After 46 minutes and 34.6 seconds, the first runner reached the finish line. His name is Zhang Wei, a teacher at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Technical School, who has only been practicing long-distance running for a year. He was the first-place winner of the 1956 Beijing Workers' Cross-Country Race. Dong Yaolu, a student from the Beijing University of Mining and Technology, closely followed and reached the finish line. He used to be a worker at the Yangquan Coal Mine, with 12 years of work experience. He won the second place in the 5,000-meter race at the First National Coal Mine Workers' Sports Games in 1955. Less than 2 minutes later, the third runner, Sun Keyi, arrived. He is a student at the Central Institute of Physical Education. The fourth runner, Han Zaiyao, and the fifth runner, Peng Tiequan, arrived shortly after; Han Zaiyao is a staff member of the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, and Peng Tiequan is a "Three Goods" student in the third grade of senior high school at Beijing No. 4 Boys' Middle School.
    The race was approximately 12,000 meters long. The participating athletes demonstrated great perseverance. Except for 3 people who stopped halfway due to physical exhaustion, the rest persisted and ran to the finish line. The top 5 athletes received the "Victory Cup"; the 6th to 20th place finishers, and the 21st to 50th place finishers also received prizes; and all athletes who completed the entire race after 50th place each received a commemorative medal.

    北京市昨天举行胜利杯环城赛跑
    2月15日上午，来自工厂、学校、机关等不同工作岗位的1，450名穿着各式各样不同颜色运动服的男子长跑运动员在北京天安门广场跳跃着。他们等待着人民日报、光明日报、工人日报、中国青年报、新体育杂志、北京日报、北京青年等报刊联合举办的“1956年北京市胜利杯环城赛跑”的开始。
    信号枪响，运动员们由3辆摩托车引导，从天安门前向西奔去。他们沿着环行电车道，经西单、西四、平安里，向东经北海后门、铁狮子胡同，再向南经东四、东单，折返天安门原起跑点。沿途行人住足观看，并鼓掌向运动员们祝贺。许多老奶奶也领着孩子们在各自家门口观看。沿途还有鼓动站和鼓动车，敲锣打鼓为运动员们“加油”，祝贺他们跑完全程取得胜利。
    过了46分34秒6的时间，第1名跑到终点。他叫张威，长辛店机车车辆修理工厂技工学校的教师，练习长跑还只一年。他是1956年北京市工人越野赛跑第1名的获得者。北京矿冶学院学生董耀禄紧接着跑到终点，他曾经是阳泉煤矿的工人，工龄12年，1955年全国煤矿第一届职工体育运动大会上他获得过5，000公尺赛跑第2名。相隔不到2分钟，第3名孙克宜到达，他是中央体育学院学生。第四名韩载尧和第五名蓬铁权紧接着到达；韩载尧是北京市建筑工程局工作人员，蓬铁权是北京市男子第四中学高中三年级的“三好”学生。
    赛跑全程约12，000公尺，参加比赛的运动员表现了极大的毅力，除3人因身体不支中途停止以外，其余都坚持跑到终点。获得前5名的运动员分别得到“胜利杯”；第6名到第20名，第21名到第50名，也分别获得奖品；50名以后凡跑完全程的运动员，也各得纪念章一枚。（附图片）
