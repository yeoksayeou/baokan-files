Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: A special exhibition displaying and introducing famous commodities opened in the Qianmen District of Beijing today.

　　The 750-plus commodities on display are mostly varieties with a long history, special flavors, and a high reputation in the city or across the country. The Moon Sheng Zhai’s spiced beef and spiced mutton, famous for their aroma and crispness, have a history of over 200 years and are made using a set of special production techniques passed down through generations. The Peking duck roasted in the hanging oven with fruit wood at Bian Yi Fang, the oldest Peking duck restaurant in the city, is deliciously fatty, with crispy skin and tender meat, and is welcomed by Chinese and foreigners alike. The shaomai and fried triangular dumplings displayed by the Du Yi Chu restaurant aroused great interest among the audience. The shaomai filling is made with sea cucumber, shrimp, and pork, and has a delicious flavor. Also on display were Tong San Yi Food Store's specialty autumn pear paste and pine nut honey dates, Tian Sheng's Qing sauce meat, Dou Zhi Zhang's (a famous store) douzhi (fermented mung bean milk), Liu Bi Ju Pickles' preserved eight-treasure melon, pickled black vegetables, and various other pickles, Wang Zhi He's five-spice stinky tofu, Jin Gao Zhang's (Tai Xing Store) osmanthus hawthorn cake, Ma Ju Yuan Hat Store's ethnic minority hats, Nei Lian Sheng Shoe Store's thousand-layer soft-soled cloth shoes, Dai Yue Xuan's calligraphy brushes, and Tong Ren Tang's tiger bone medicinal wine. These varieties all received praise from the audience.

　　Beijing’s state-owned commercial departments recently conducted a survey and research work to rank famous products by industry. State-owned commercial departments have provided financial assistance to stores with insufficient funds or state-owned banks have provided loans, and have also helped solve difficulties in raw material supply. Consequently, many famous varieties that had been interrupted for a long time, such as Bian Yi Fang's tubuzi chicken and crispy fish, Tong San Yi's autumn pear paste, Xiang Ju Gong Food Store's honey three-knife pastry, and Du Yi Chu's malian meat, have been or are being restored to production and supply.

    北京著名商品展览会开幕
    据新华社19日讯　一个专门陈列和介绍著名商品的展览会今天在北京市前门区开幕了。
    这里陈列的750多种商品，大都是历史悠久，有特殊风味，在全市或全国有较高信誉的品种。以香、酥出名的月盛斋酱牛肉、酱羊肉，有200多年历史，是用几代传下来的一套特殊制作技艺作成的。全市最古老的烤鸭店便意坊吊炉用果木烤的填鸭，焦肥味美，皮脆肉嫩，受到中外人士欢迎。展出的都一处便饭馆的烧麦和炸三角，引起观众很大兴趣，烧麦饀是用海参、虾仁、猪肉制作的，味道鲜美。展出的通三益食品店的特产秋梨膏、松仁蜜枣，天盛的清酱肉，豆汁张（名远店）的豆汁，六必居酱园的八宝瓜、酱黑菜等各种酱菜，王致和的五香臭豆腐，金糕张（泰兴店）的桂花金糕，马聚源帽店的少数民族帽子，内联升鞋店的千层软底布鞋，戴月轩的毛笔，同仁堂的虎骨药酒等品种，都受到观众的称赞。
    北京市国营商业部门最近曾按行业进行了名品排队的调查研究工作，对资金不足的商店都由国营商业部门给予资金帮助或由国家银行给予贷款，并且帮助解决原料供应上的困难。便意坊中断已久的桶子鸡、酥鱼，通三益的秋梨膏，祥聚公食品店的蜜三刀和都一处的马连肉等许多著名品种因而得以恢复或正在恢复制作供应。
