    Accelerating Design Progress is Entirely Possible
    Ren Bishi, Director of the Design Management Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry
    The design institutions of the coal mine system undertake arduous design tasks. During the First Five-Year Plan, over 80% of new mine shafts were designed domestically, and all major reconstruction and restoration projects in the coal mine system during the First Five-Year Plan were also designed domestically. Over the past few years, relying on the continuous improvement of the political and technical levels of design personnel, and with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, learning by doing, we have basically completed our tasks. By the end of 1955, more than 60 pairs of new mine shafts designed domestically had started construction, of which the Xiaohanshan vertical shaft in Jixi and the Lingxi vertical shaft in Shuangyashan had been put into production, and the large-scale, modern Xieji集 mine will also be put into production this year.
    Coal mine design work has always been in a contradiction between large tasks and small forces. Taking the design workload in 1953 as 100, it was 375 in 1954 and 571.2 in 1955; while the increase in design technical personnel, taking 1953 as 100, only increased to 120 in 1954, and only 150 in 1955. The increase in design technical personnel is difficult to adapt to the rapid increase in design tasks, and this situation is difficult to change in the future. Taking this year's design tasks as an example, it has increased by about 75% compared to last year, more than 785 of 1953, while the increase in design technical strength this year is limited. In order to solve this contradiction, we have taken some measures in the past few years, and only by tapping potential in these areas in the future and accelerating the design progress can we meet the growing needs of coal mine construction.
    The first measure taken is to carry out cross-operations and advance design where possible. In mining areas with stable coal seams and simple geological structures, when the geological drilling work is completed and the basic data required for design is available, we begin to study the well field development plan and prepare preliminary designs, and then make appropriate revisions after the formal geological report is submitted. This can advance the design time by more than one to two months. Moreover, due to the stability of the coal seams, and especially due to the gradual improvement of the quality of geological work, the amount of revised design work is also decreasing year by year. After the design plan is determined, the mine capacity, well depth, section, coordinates, main equipment specifications, and industrial square layout have been determined, the layout sketch and equipment specifications can be handed over to the construction department to prepare in advance, which greatly saves time. Within the design institution, cross-operations are also carried out between the main business sections and between the design groups within the section, which saves a lot of time; due to the strengthening of the mutual connection of each link, the design quality is not affected.
    In 1953 and 1954, when various coal mine design institutes prepared preliminary designs, they often disagreed on the development plan and could not quickly determine it; sometimes it was changed repeatedly, delaying it for several months. In the third quarter of 1955, we learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and organized more than 20 designers from six design institutes and three mining bureaus to conduct batch classified design plan planning based on the geological data that had been collected. Under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, 42 pairs of new mine design plans were prepared at one time, with a design capacity of more than 18 million tons, of which 26 pairs of mines are projects that will start construction this year. In the design plans of these mines, the well type and design capacity were determined, and the development plan and the specifications of main equipment such as lifting were proposed. This practice has changed the handicraft management method of the Design Management Bureau, which is difficult to adapt to the large-scale construction of the national coal industry. It is estimated that it can save more than 20% of the preliminary design time, and save the time for various coal mine design institutes to review the design plans back and forth, exchange experience in comparing design plans, improve technical level, and also provide a reliable basis for planning work to prepare plans, and construction units and equipment supply departments can also prepare for construction and order equipment in advance. This year we also plan to adopt this method: to prepare design plans for well construction projects in 1957 and during the Second Five-Year Plan.
    In addition, according to the different geological conditions and engineering properties of the mines, we have also simplified some design procedures. For example, for mines with an annual output of less than 300,000 tons, we combine technical design and construction drawings, or combine preliminary design and technical design, or adopt a simple preliminary design and construction drawing two-stage design method, depending on the specific conditions. When designing the same type of mine in the same coal field, we generally adopt the method of mutual application, only making local modifications, and not conducting separate design. For restored mines, we generally start construction only after a restoration plan is made. These can shorten the design time by one to three months.
    The above measures are mainly adopted in the preliminary design and technical design stages, but the workload of these two design stages only accounts for 10%-30% of the complete set of design workload, and the most arduous workload is the construction drawing design, and the work of this design stage is directly related to whether the construction progress can be accelerated and whether the construction force can be brought into play smoothly. In this regard, we emphasized the use of standard designs and the repeated use of drawings. Since 1953, standard design organizations have been established in the three coal mine design institutes in Beijing, Shenyang, and Shanghai. In addition to the survey and design plan, standard design plans are also issued in the annual plans over the years. In the spring of 1953, a civil building design drawing exchange meeting was held, focusing on solving the problem of drawings for civil building projects. In 1954, a drawing exchange meeting for tunnel engineering and some electromechanical designs was held, which partially solved the problem of drawings in this regard. However, due to the fact that coal mine construction has just begun, engineering construction has not yet been carried out on a large scale, the design work time is not long, there are not many finished products, and the accumulation of data is not enough, and more importantly, due to our insufficient understanding, the standard drawings used and the drawings reused in these two years only accounted for 4%-5% of the construction drawing workload. By the second half of 1954, the situation that the construction project was carried out on a large scale and the design could not keep up with the construction became increasingly serious, and the understanding gradually became clear, and the conservative ideas of not wanting to use standard drawings and reuse drawings were criticized. In 1955, the total standard design and reuse drawings used by the design institutes throughout the year were estimated to reach 15% of the total construction drawing workload, of which Beijing and Hankou institutes could reach 22%-25%. By the end of last year, coal mine design institutes in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Hankou, etc. can generally deliver construction drawings three months before construction. In order to prepare for this year's construction projects in advance, we held a national coal mine design system drawing exchange conference in early December last year, and found that 4,687 of the 6,560 projects under construction this year can use standard drawings or have drawings that can be reused. It is estimated that except for some drawings that need to be slightly modified, more than 100,000 workdays can be saved, which is equivalent to the workload of more than 500 designers for one year. In addition, we are preparing construction drawings for various industrial buildings in the industrial square of various types of mines except for the production system on the basis of the approved standard preliminary designs, and it is estimated that all of them can be submitted before February this year, so that the drawing problem of the ground buildings of new mines can be fundamentally solved. In order to consolidate this measure, we also stipulated at the end of last year that each coal mine design institute should prepare plans for the use of standard designs and reused drawings on a quarterly basis, and stipulated that new designs are not allowed where there are standard designs or drawings that can be reused. The problems in this regard are that the quality of some drawings is not high, the drawings of the ground production system of the mines cannot meet the needs, and the equipment selection, non-standard equipment specifications, and building modules are still quite chaotic, which need to be solved step by step.
    The road to solving the contradiction between the large task and small force of coal mine design work and accelerating the design progress is extremely broad. We have the confidence to step up our efforts in all aspects, complete the design tasks for coal mine construction in 1956, and meet the growing needs of national construction.

    加快设计进度是完全可能的
    煤炭工业部设计管理总局局长　任弼绍
    煤矿系统的设计机构担负着繁重的设计任务。第一个五年计划期间，有占设计能力80％以上的新建矿井是由国内设计的，第一个五年计划期间煤矿系统的全部改建和恢复的重大工程的设计任务也是由国内担负的。几年来，依靠设计人员不断的提高政治思想水平和技术水平，依靠苏联专家的热诚帮助，边做边学，我们基本上完成了任务。到1955年止，已经有60对以上国内设计的新建矿井开工，其中鸡西小恒山竖井和双鸭山岭西竖井已经投入生产，大型的近代化的谢家集矿井，也将在今年投入生产。
    煤矿设计工作始终处在任务大、力量小的矛盾中。设计工作量以1953年为100，则1954年为375，1955年为571.2；而设计技术人员的增长以1953年为100，1954年只增为120，1955年也只增为150。设计技术人员的增长很难同设计任务急剧加大的情况相适应，这个情况在今后一个时期内还是难以改变的。拿今年的设计任务来说，又比去年增加约75％，为1953年的785以上，而今年设计技术力量的增长则是有限的。为了解决这个矛盾，几年来我们采取了一些措施，今后也只有从这些方面发掘潜力，加快设计进度，才能满足煤矿建设日益增长的需要。
    首先采取的措施是在可能条件下实行交叉作业，提前设计。我们在煤层稳定，地质构造简单的矿区，当地质钻探工作完毕，设计所需的基本资料具备的时候，就开始研究井田开拓方案，编制初步设计，待正式地质报告提出后，再加以适当修改。这样做就可以将设计时间提前一个月到两个月以上。而且，由于煤层稳定，特别是由于地质工作的质量逐年提高，修改的设计工作量也是逐年减少的。当设计方案决定以后，矿井能力，井筒深度、断面、座标、主要设备规格及工业广场布置已经确定了，就可以把布置草图和设备规格交给施工部门，提前进行准备，大大争取了时间。在设计机构内部，各主要业务科之间，科内各设计组之间也进行交叉作业，争取了很多时间；由于加强了各个环节的相互联系，并不影响设计质量。
    1953年和1954年，各个煤矿设计院编制初步设计的时候，常常在开拓方案上意见分歧，不能很快确定下来；有时再三变更，拖延几个月之久。1955年第三季度，我们学习苏联先进经验，组织六个设计院和三个矿务局20多位设计人员，根据已经搜集到的地质资料，进行成批分类设计方案规划。在苏联专家具体指导下，一次编制了42对新建矿井的设计方案，设计能力达1，800万吨以上，其中有26对矿井是今年开工的项目。在这些矿井的设计方案里，都确定了井型、设计能力、提出了开拓方案和提升等主要设备的规格。这种做法改变了设计管理总局难以和国家煤炭工业大规模建设相适应的手工业管理方法，估计可节约初步设计时间20％以上，并且节省了各个煤矿设计院往返审核设计方案的时间，互相交流了设计方案比较的经验，提高了技术水平，还给计划工作提供了编制计划的可靠的基础，施工单位和设备供应部门也可以提前进行施工准备和订购设备。今年我们还准备采用这个办法：编制1957年和第二个五年计划期间建井项目的设计方案。
    另外，根据矿井地质情况和工程性质的不同，我们还分别简化了一些设计程序。例如年产30万吨以下的矿井，我们根据具体条件，或者把技术设计和施工图合并进行，或者把初步设计和技术设计合并进行，或者采取简易初步设计及施工图两段设计方法。在进行同煤田同类型矿井设计时，一般采取互相套用方式，只作局部修改，不另外进行设计。恢复矿井，一般是只做恢复方案就开工。这些，都可以将设计时间缩短一个月到三个月。
    以上几项措施，主要是在初步设计和技术设计阶段采用的，但是这两个设计阶段的工作量仅占成套设计工作量的10％—30％，最繁重的工作量还是施工图设计，而且这个设计阶段的工作直接关系施工进度能否加快，施工力量能否顺利的发挥作用。我们在这方面强调了采用标准设计和重复使用图纸。1953年起，北京、沈阳、上海3个煤矿设计院都设立了标准设计组织。在历年年度计划中，除勘查设计计划外，并且颁发标准设计计划。1953年春召开一次民用建筑设计图纸交流会议，着重解决了民用建筑工程的图纸问题。1954年召开一次井巷工程及部分机电设计图纸交流会议，部分解决了这方面的图纸问题。但是由于煤矿建设刚刚开始，工程施工还没有大量展开，设计工作时间不久，成品不多，资料积累还不足，更主要的是由于我们的认识不足，因之这两年里采用的标准图纸和重复使用的图纸仅占施工图工作量的4％—5％。到1954年下半年，施工工程大量展开，设计赶不上施工的情况日趋严重，认识上才逐渐明确起来，批判了不愿采用标准图纸及重复使用图纸的保守思想，1955年各设计院年度总计使用的标准设计及重复使用图纸，估计可达施工图总工作量的15％，其中北京、汉口两院可达22％到25％。到去年年底，北京、沈阳、上海、汉口等煤矿设计院一般都可以做到施工前三个月交出施工图纸。为了给今年的建设工程提前做好准备，我们在去年12月初召开了全国煤矿设计系统图纸交流大会，发现今年施工的6，560项工程中有4，687项可以采用标准图纸或有图纸可以重复使用。估计除部分图纸需稍加修改外，可节约10万以上的工日，约等于500多个设计人员一年的工作量。此外，我们正在已经批准的标准初步设计的基础上，编制各型矿井工业广场内除生产系统外的各项工业建筑的施工图纸，估计在今年二月以前可以全部提出，这样，新建矿井地面建筑的图纸问题可以根本解决。为了巩固这项措施，我们在去年年底还规定了各个煤矿设计院要按季度编制使用标准设计及重复使用图纸的计划，规定了有标准设计或有图纸可以重复使用的不允许新设计的制度。在这方面的问题是部分图纸质量不高，矿井地面生产系统图纸还不能满足需要，设备选型、非标准设备规格和建筑模数还相当混乱，需要逐步解决。
    解决煤矿设计工作任务大、力量小的矛盾，加快设计进度的道路是极其广阔的。我们有信心加紧各方面的努力，完成1956年煤矿建设的设计任务，满足国家建设日益增长的需要。
