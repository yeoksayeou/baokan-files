Among the poets of the Five Dynasties period, Li Yu, the last ruler of the Southern Tang, left behind a small body of work, but it has been extremely praised by traditional critics throughout history. It is worth noting that this adulation from many critics has not diminished with the death of the old era. However, it is clear that Li Yu's works lack the profound sympathy for the suffering of the people found in great poets of the preceding era, such as Du Fu and Bai Juyi, and also the fervent concern for the fate of the motherland found in important poets of the subsequent era, such as Xin Qiji and Lu You. Li Yu only sings of his own imperial life and his life as a prisoner. Many of his works are sentimental, unhealthy, and some are decadent. Therefore, from the perspective of the people, how should Li Yu's poetry be evaluated? This is a question worthy of study. This issue involves our fundamental attitude towards the literary heritage.

From August of last year to January of this year, the "Literary Heritage" supplement of Guangming Daily successively published many articles debating Li Yu's poetry. Both sides of the debate paid great attention to the era of Li Yu, Li Yu himself, the political measures of Li Yu's father, Li Jing, and Li Yu's grandfather, Li Bian. A prominent example is Comrade Wu Ying's "Several Questions on the Evaluation of Li Yu's Poetry" ("Literary Heritage," issue 75). Comrade Wu Ying believes that "critics, when commenting on Li Yu and his poetry, share a common problem, which is a great lack of understanding of the specific historical circumstances of the 'Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms' and the Southern Tang." Thus, he examines the political and economic life of the Southern Tang over several decades, the good political measures of Li Bian, Li Jing, and Li Yu, affirming that Li Yu was a "patriot" and "ultimately unyielding," thereby proving and affirming that Li Yu's poetry has "patriotism" or "patriotic sentiments," and a further developed "popular character." The other side of the debate also used the same method, citing some opposing facts to prove their own opposing arguments. It seems that if this continues, there will be a lot of "textual research" to be done. It cannot be said that this textual research is not beneficial to the study of Li Yu's poetry, nor can it be said that the two sides of the debate only engaged in textual research. The question is what position should the study of the author and his era hold in the analysis of works. Marxists should study the historical background of writers and literary works. Literature is a form of social ideology and a reflection of real life. Any writer or work is produced in a specific era and is constrained by specific social and historical conditions. Without studying the era and the author, it is impossible to correctly interpret the history of literature, and the analysis and evaluation of works will be difficult. However, in any case, such research cannot replace the specific analysis of the work itself, and cannot mechanically and simply use the rise and fall of the era and the life of the author to judge the value of the work. Analyzing literary works should primarily start from the work itself, and evaluate it based on the work itself and its influence. Any in-depth study of the author's personal life, political thoughts, and era can only explain why the author wrote such works, the significance of such works at the time, and their impact on later generations, thereby helping to understand the work, but cannot depart from the actual content of the work and decide or change the value of the work itself based solely on these factors. Clearly, Li Yu's political actions, whether he did more good deeds or more bad deeds, cannot change the objective meaning of Li Yu's poetry, which already exists and cannot be modified. The political actions of Li Yu's father and grandfather have even less to do with the evaluation of Li Yu's poetry. Originally, this issue was discussed by many people when criticizing Yu Pingbo's erroneous views on "Dream of the Red Chamber" research. Today, discussing Li Yu's poetry and having to raise this issue again shows that some people's "textual research addiction" is too deep and not easily changed in a short time.

Below, let's take a look at how the articles in "Literary Heritage" discuss the patriotism and popular character of Li Yu's poetry.

Many authors affirm and praise the poetry written by Li Yu after his capture for containing patriotic feelings. Comrade Wu Ying even said: "The question of whether Li Yu's poetry in this period contains patriotic thoughts and feelings is actually not worth debating." Indeed, Li Yu's poetry after his capture does mention "old country" and "rivers and mountains" in a few places. However, what lies behind these words is actually not the patriotic thought and feeling of the people. Patriotism is love for the motherland, not love for the homeland, let alone love for the dynasty and the throne. Patriotism is the product of the common interests formed by the people and their motherland over a long period of history, especially in the struggle against foreign aggression. Lenin said: Patriotism is "the deepest feeling of attachment to one's own unique motherland, consolidated over hundreds and thousands of years." In China, since the Qin and Han dynasties (different from the situation before the Qin and Han dynasties when a unified great power had not been formed for a long time), the patriotism of the Han people has been inseparable from a unified China dominated by the Han people. During the Three Kingdoms period, the rulers and ministers of Wei, Shu, and Wu did not and could not make the people in the temporarily divided territories believe that they should separately love the three "motherlands" and should regard each other as "foreigners." During the extended period of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, which lasted for about 300 years, the Han people maintained a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm for the invading foreign tribes, and their common desire was to restore the Central Plains. However, they did not believe that being loyal to any one of the royal families or warlords of Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen was loving the motherland. Then, for the Southern Tang, which was "established" for only 40 years, with a territory covering only a corner of the southeast, and whose ruler Li Jing had already become a vassal of the Zhou dynasty, and whose ruler Li Yu had already become a vassal of the Song dynasty, what basis is there to say that its people had developed a feeling that could be called loving the motherland for the Li dynasty? If so, during the short period of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, which lasted only fifty years, how many different "motherlands" should there have been among the Chinese people, and how many conflicting "patriotisms" should have arisen! Everyone knows that this is simply not the case. However, some critics, because of their infatuation with Li Yu's poetry, do not hesitate to distort basic historical facts, insisting that the people in the southeast supported the division of the motherland and opposed the unification of the motherland, insisting that Li Yu's "loss of his country" was the Chinese people's "loss of their country"!

Some critics, in order to further defend themselves and Li Yu, insist that Li Yu's "love of country" is a manifestation of "love of the people." Comrade Wu Zuxiang even believes that it is a "tragic" manifestation of the progressive forces being swallowed up by the backward forces and being helpless. They say that after China was unified in the Song dynasty, it regressed compared to the Five Dynasties period. Therefore, the people in the southeast at that time missed Li Yu in such and such ways. Due to the limitations of the topic, let's put aside this "theory" of supporting division for the time being. However, if the southeast was relatively prosperous during the Five Dynasties period, can it be said that it was due to Li Yu's "love of the people," who only ascended the throne after the end of the Five Dynasties period? Moreover, what basis is there to prove that Li Yu's poetry is about missing the people in the southeast? Not only can't this be found in Li Yu's early poetry, but even in his later poetry, people can only find: "Once turned into a captive, my slender waist and temples grew gray. The most hurried day was when I bid farewell to the temple; the musicians still played the parting song. Tears were shed before the palace maids." "Rouge tears, enticing revelers, when will they return?" "The carved railings and jade steps should still be there, only the rosy cheeks have changed." "It's still like the old days when I roamed the imperial garden; carriages flowed like water, horses like dragons." "I imagine the jade towers and palace halls, shining empty on the Qinhuai River." And so on. Can these be called missing the people and representing progress? On the contrary, these poems prove that what Li Yu missed was not the people, but his own honor and disgrace; what he longed for was not progress, but the life of the court. If these can prove that he loved the country and the people, then every emperor who lamented the loss of the throne, every aristocrat who lamented the destruction of a luxurious life, would be figures who loved the country and the people!

Some critics simply assert that Li Yu's poetry has always possessed popular character. For example, Comrade Chu Zi said in "Li Houzhu and the Evaluation of His Works" ("Literary Heritage," issue 74): Many poems written by Li Yu in his early years that depict sincere love life are beyond the emotions of the ruling class. Comrade Wu Ying also believes that the "common ideological and emotional characteristics" of Li Yu's early poetry are seriousness, sincerity, and deep affection. "Such thoughts and feelings, on the one hand, are different from the decadent thoughts and feelings of the ruling class, and on the other hand, lead to the thoughts and feelings of the people." Whether singing about "sincere love life" necessarily transcends the emotions of the ruling class, we will also set aside for now. However, how can Li Yu's behavior and works prove his "sincere love life"? Li Yu's "fondness for sensuality" is historically famous. And the phrases in his early works such as "makeup just finished, bright skin like snow," "golden sparrow hairpin, rosy face," "the beauty dances, golden hairpins slip," "waking from a spring nap, makeup faded, who will fix her emerald hair," "chewing on red floss, laughing and spitting at my darling," "it's hard for this slave to come out, let you indulge as you please," can indeed be confirmed by the judgment of "fondness for sensuality." It is difficult to understand why people can see any "sincere love life" and "serious" "popular character" in these phrases.

There are even more people who believe that Li Yu's works after his capture possess popular character, and many believe that the popular character of Li Yu's works reached a further height from then on. Comrade Chu Zi said: The content of these poems, "filled with loneliness, loneliness, regret, and desolation," "has objectively broken through his own life experience"; those verses do not completely match Li Yu's experiences and deeds, but are "similar and connected" to the unfortunate people under the dark feudal social rule, and to "the warriors who broke with the dark reality." Comrade Chu Zi even believes that due to the unprecedented sharpening of social contradictions and the feudal society going downhill, people had to "look back and cherish" the past in disappointment. Comrade You Guoen also said that what Li Yu felt at that time was "also what the people at that time felt in common." Comrade Wu Ying said that Li Yu, after being captured, used the feeling and understanding of a prisoner to think about problems, and thus "understood some new truths of life" and "felt the loveliness of the old country more deeply"; Li Yu "not only could experience the pain of the country's demise in his experience as a prisoner, but also could deeply appreciate the pain of prisoners who lost their freedom. From the pain of the country's demise to the pain of losing freedom, it means that the popular character of Li Yu's poetry has reached a further height." Although these opinions are adorned with a series of new modern terms, their essence is nothing more than repeating Wang Guowei's "Words in the Human World." Wang Guowei believed that Li Yu's works after surrendering to the Song dynasty "seem to have the meaning of Sakyamuni Christ bearing the sins of mankind." But is this really the case?

The extant poetry of Li Yu, including those that may have been written by others, totals only 40-odd pieces. It can be roughly determined that only a little over ten pieces were written after his capture. As already mentioned above, these poems are mostly about his longing for his old imperial life of splendor, mourning the loss of these happy lives, and sorrow for his life as a prisoner. What relationship do these have with "popular character"? The basic content of the so-called popular character of literary works should be reflecting the thoughts, feelings, wishes, and demands of the broad masses of the people at the time, and reflecting their interests. However, does Li Yu's poetry reflect the people's thoughts and feelings? Did the people feel that their country and family were destroyed because of the unification of the motherland? Are the people reminiscing about their imperial gardens, palace maids, and the rouge tears of prostitutes? Under feudal rule, the people were oppressed and demanded freedom. However, which of Li Yu's poems expresses this desire of the people for freedom? Where does he show his break with the dark reality, and his "communication" with anti-feudal warriors? If it is said that he is repenting, in which poem did he repent for his licentious life in Nanjing? What he hates, mainly, is that his "moment of pleasure" was too fleeting, like flowing water and falling flowers, gone and never to return!

All of this is originally very clear. The problem is: why has Li Yu's poetry been loved by many readers for nearly a thousand years?

The reason why Li Yu's poetry is loved is first of all because of the sorrow revealed in his works after his capture. Although in substance it is different from the sorrow of the people, it has some similarities in certain aspects. Li Yu's readers often do not see him as a captured emperor, and do not even understand that he is a captured emperor. They pay neither attention to the jade towers and palace halls of yesterday that he mourns, nor to the pearl tears and silk quilts of today that he is saddened by, as these are not things that ordinary readers can have. They are only moved by the sighs about life such as "Alone I lean on the west tower, the moon is like a hook. In the deep courtyard, the lonely parasol tree locks in the desolate autumn." and "How much sorrow can there be? It's just like a river of spring water flowing eastward!" The various unfortunate, declining, people far from their hometowns, and people who temporarily lost their motherland in the old era could find their spiritual companions in these sentimental verses of Li Yu. There are a few poems by Li Yu that do not involve the special sorrow of those who have lost their thrones, and these poems can more easily arouse widespread resonance. For example:

Speechless, I climb the west tower alone, the moon like a hook, a lonely paulownia tree locks the desolate autumn in the deep courtyard. Cutting it won't sever it, sorting it won't untangle it. It is the sorrow of separation, a different kind of feeling in my heart. (Joy of Reunion)

Idle dream far away, the South is in clear autumn: thousands of miles of rivers and mountains are cold and dark, a lonely boat is moored in the depths of the reed flowers. A flute plays in the moonlit tower. (Remembering Jiangnan)

As long as the meaning of these works is not unduly exaggerated, then people's love for these works is originally easy to understand. Although the realm of "lonely parasol tree in the deep courtyard" and "lonely boat in the depths of the reed flowers" will not evoke the same associations in any era and maintain the same appeal, as long as people feel longing and pain when leaving their loved ones and familiar land, they will thank Li Yu for delicately writing out their feelings. Here, we neither need to assume that Li Yu was writing for the people, nor should we deny that in his entire work, his feelings and the feelings of the people, his sorrow and the sorrow of the people, are fundamentally two different things.

It must be pointed out that Li Yu's later works have a pessimistic atmosphere. This is very natural for him; and the fact that this pessimistic atmosphere infected many readers in the old era is also very natural. Of course, in any era, the people need optimistic strivers; but in the past, it was easy for the unfortunate to appreciate and accept the philosophy of "life is long and sorrow flows east." Some people are not unfortunate, but their wishes are often not fulfilled, and their happiness is often not long-lasting, so they are also willing to convert to this cheap pessimism. However, times have changed. The vast number of young people in the new era are creating their own happiness with labor with full confidence. For them, the world is not worse than before, but better than before. Therefore, it will not be so easy to sell this "profound" formula of "life is long and sorrow flows east" to today's youth. Those who are enthusiastic about selling this set cannot but be subject to the legitimate suspicion and blame of public opinion...

The reason why Li Yu's poetry is loved is also because these works have high artistic skills. In the history of ci, this lyrical short poem, Li Yu's achievement should be recognized as outstanding. In many of Li Yu's poems, all the descriptions are natural, without any traces of carving. Li Yu's language, especially in his later works, is generally simple, fresh, refined, and accurate, with few cliches and affectations. In this respect, he is clearly different from Wen Tingyun and others. In the trend of many poets in the late Tang and Five Dynasties being accustomed to piling up ornate phrases, this tendency cannot but be said to be valuable. Li Yu is good at grasping the characteristics of things that allow people to clearly feel and imagine, and is good at choosing precise and vivid images as metaphors, so he can use very few words to depict vivid and moving situations. Li Yu's artistic skills are an important heritage in the history of Chinese poetry, and have not lost their significance for Chinese poetry art today.

However, it should be pointed out that Li Yu's artistic achievements also have great limitations. Li Yu's interest and understanding of real life are very narrow and superficial. As Wang Guowei said: He "was born in the depths of the palace, raised by the hands of women." Therefore, his early works wrote almost entirely about women in the court and brothels. Even in his later works, the objects of his memories and emotions are still very simple, to the point of often repeating each other. People see many dreams, tears, and sorrows from him, but it is not easy to see a richer expression of life (including the author's own spiritual life). Wang Guowei said: "Objective poets must have seen a lot of the world. The deeper they have seen the world, the richer and more varied the materials will be. The authors of Water Margin and Dream of the Red Chamber are examples of this. Subjective poets do not need to see much of the world. The shallower they have seen the world, the truer their temperament will be. Li Houzhu is an example of this." This idealistic praise, on the contrary, constitutes the correct disparagement. Li Yu's weakness is also the common weakness of most "lyric poets" throughout the ages.

Why do people have so much discussion about Li Yu's poetry, and why is it difficult to reach a solution? One of the reasons is that people feel that since something is to be accepted as a literary heritage, it must have patriotism and popular character. However, Marxism has not established such a formula. In recent years, people's interest in Chinese classical literature has increased, and many people attempt to use new perspectives and methods in their research on Chinese classical literature. These are all encouraging phenomena. However, there is still a serious situation in the treatment of classical literature, which is to simply put forward a few concepts, such as popular character, national thought, patriotism, humanitarianism, etc., to examine works. Works that meet these requirements are good works, and those that do not are bad works; or to arbitrarily use these concepts to affirm and interpret works, regardless of whether they conform to the actual situation of the works. This approach is wrong, because literature that reflects life is as complex and diverse as life, and cannot be encompassed by a few simple concepts. Not to mention the differences in form and content between a long novel and a short poem, even with poems that are completely the same in form, metrical pattern, and even number of words, such as five-character regulated verses, there can be Du Fu's "The country is broken, mountains and rivers remain; in the spring city, grass and trees grow lush." and there can also be Wang Wei's "Rivers flow beyond heaven and earth, mountain colors are sometimes visible, sometimes not." Du Fu's fervent patriotic feelings are naturally good, but it cannot be said that Wang Wei's beautiful depiction of natural scenery has no value. Everyone admits that great works full of popular character are the main body of our literary heritage. However, this certainly does not mean that works other than these are all reactionary; nor does it mean that if a work has merit, it must be forcibly labeled with popular character through far-fetched interpretations. Li Yu's poetry is one of the many examples that have encountered such far-fetched interpretations. Li Yu's poetry has artistic value and does not particularly promote any reactionary views, but it should not be taken to another extreme and said that they are works of patriotism and popular character. Similarly, Li Yu was not a cruel and evil emperor, but it should not be said that he was a patriot, an unyielding person, and a representative of progressive forces. Judging from the discussion about Li Yu, there is a serious phenomenon of simplification and dogmatism in our literary research, especially in the research on our literary heritage. This is simplifying complex literary phenomena and simplifying Marxism. As a result, what replaces arduous and difficult labor is the application of a few formulas and a few terms, which distorts literature and, even more so, distorts Marxism. Some people, such as Comrades Wu Ying, Chu Zi, You Guoen, and Wu Zuxiang mentioned in this article, also subjectively want to use Marxism, but due to a lack of a realistic attitude, or also due to a preference for old sentimental tones, and unconditionally sympathizing with the unfortunate, they cannot but violate Marxism as a result. This tendency of simplification and far-fetched interpretations in literary criticism, because it uses a set of seemingly correct but actually wrong Marxist terms, is even more harmful. For the healthy development of our literary research, especially the research on classical literature, this tendency should be overcome.

    评关于李煜的词的讨论
    毛星
    五代词人中，南唐后主李煜留下的作品很少，但是，历来受到传统的批评家的极度的推崇。值得注意的是，许多批评家的这种推崇并没有因为旧时代的死亡而有所减弱。可是，很显然，李煜所歌咏的，既缺乏在他前一个时代的伟大诗人如杜甫、白居易等的对人民疾苦的深刻同情，也缺乏在他后一个时代的重要诗人如辛弃疾、陆游等的对祖国命运的热切关怀。李煜只歌唱自己的帝王生活和囚徒生活，而且许多作品是感伤的，不健康的，也有些是颓废的。那么，从人民的观点看来，李煜的词究竟应该怎样评价，就很值得研究了。这个问题牵涉到我们对文学遗产的基本态度。
    从去年8月到今年1月，光明日报周刊“文学遗产”上陆续发表了很多篇关于李煜的词的争论文字。争论的双方，都对于李煜的时代和李煜本人、李煜的父亲李璟、李煜的祖父李昪的政治措施，给予了很大注意。比较显著的例子，可以提出吴颖同志的“关于李煜词评价的几个问题”（“文学遗产”75期）。吴颖同志认为：“评论家们在对李煜和他的词进行评论的时候，存在着一种共同的情况，那就是对‘五代十国’和南唐的具体历史情况很不了解。”于是他考证了南唐几十年的政治经济生活，李昪的、李璟的、李煜的好的政治措施，肯定李煜是“爱国者”，“最后是不屈服者”，并因而证明和肯定李煜的词有“爱国主义”或“爱国的思想感情”，有一步进一步地发展的“人民性”。争论的另一方也用相同的方法引证了一些相反的事实，来证明自己所持的相反的论点。看来，这样争执下去，就有很多“考证”待作了。不能说这些考证对于研究李煜的词没有益处，更不能说争论的双方就只是考证了这些。问题是，考证作者及其时代对于分析作品究应摆在什么地位。马克思主义者是应该研究作家和文学作品的时代背景的。文学是社会意识形态之一，是现实生活的反映。任何作家或作品，都产生在一定的时代，并被一定的社会历史条件所制约。不研究时代，不研究作者，就不能正确地解释文学的历史，分析和评价作品就会发生困难。但是，无论如何，这样的研究不能代替作品本身的具体分析，不能机械地简单地拿时代的兴衰和作者的生平去判定作品的价值。分析文艺作品，主要地应该从作品本身出发，就作品本身及其影响给予评价。任何对于作者个人生活、政治思想及其时代的精深研究，只能说明作者为什么会写出那样的作品，那样的作品在当时的意义和对后来的影响，从而有助于对作品的了解，而不能离开作品的实际内容，仅仅根据这些去决定或改变作品本身的价值。很显然，李煜政治上的行事如何，好事多几条或坏事多几条，都不能改变已经存在的、不能再加修改的李煜的词的客观意义。李煜的父亲和祖父政治上如何，对于李煜的词的评价就更没有什么瓜葛了。本来，这个问题在批判俞平伯关于“红楼梦”研究的错误观点的时候，已经有不少人谈到了。今天讨论李煜的词，还要提出这个问题，可见有些人的“考据癖”是太深了，不是一时容易改变的。
    下面我们来看一看“文学遗产”上的论文是怎样议论李煜词的爱国主义和人民性的。
    许多作者肯定并赞扬李煜被俘后所写的词具有爱国主义的感情。吴颖同志甚至说：“这一时期李煜词有没有爱国的思想感情的问题，其实是不必争论的。”不错，李煜被俘后所写的词中，曾有几处提到“故国”、“江山”等字样。但是，在这些字样背后的，究竟是不是人民的爱国主义的思想和感情呢？爱国是爱祖国，并不是爱乡土，更不是爱王朝、爱王位。爱国主义是人民同他们的祖国在长时期历史中特别是在抵抗外族侵略的斗争中形成一定的共同利害的产物。列宁说：爱国主义是“千百年来巩固起来的对自己独有的祖国的一种最深厚的感情”。在我国，从秦汉以来（同秦汉以前长时期没有形成统一的大国的情况相异），汉族人民的爱国主义是同以汉族人民为主体的统一的中国分不开的。在三国时期，魏、蜀、吴的君臣并没有也不可能使暂时被分裂的国土上的人民认为他们应该分别地爱三个“祖国”，并且应该互相看作“外国人”。在延长约300年之久的南北朝时期，汉族人民对于入侵的外族保有高度的爱国热情，他们的共同的愿望是恢复中原，但是，他们并不认为忠于宋、齐、梁、陈的任何一个王室或军阀就是爱祖  国。那么，对于“立国”不过40年、领域不过东南一隅、而且李璟晚年已经称臣于周、李煜即位已经称臣于宋的南唐，有什么根据说它的人民对于李氏王朝就产生了一种可以称为爱祖国的感情呢？如果是这样，在短短的五十几年的五代十国时期，中国人民
  中间该有了多少个不同的“祖国”，该产生多少种互相冲突的“爱国主义”！谁都知道，这根本不是事实。可是，有些评论家因为迷恋于李煜的词，竟不惜歪曲基本的历史事实，硬说东南的人民同李煜一样拥护祖国的分裂而反对祖国的统一，硬说李煜的“亡国”就是中国人民的“亡国”！
    有些评论家为了进一步替自己和李煜辩护，硬说李煜的“爱国”乃是“爱人民”的表现，吴组缃同志甚至认为是进步势力要被落后势力吞并而又无可奈何的“悲剧性”的表现。他们说中国在宋朝统一以后，比五代时期是倒退了，因此当时东南的人民曾经如何如何地想念李煜。本文限于题旨，姑且把这种拥护分裂的“理论”放在一边。但是，五代时期东南比较繁荣，难道能说是在五代时期结束以后才即位的李煜“爱人民”的功劳吗？而且，究竟有什么根据证明李煜的词是想念东南的人民呢？不但在李煜的前期的词中，找不到这种影子，就在他的后期的词中，人们也只能找到：“一旦归为臣虏，沈腰潘鬓销磨。最是仓皇辞庙日，教坊犹奏别离歌。挥泪对宫娥。”“胭脂泪，留人醉，几时重？”“雕阑玉砌应犹在，只是朱颜改。”“还似旧时游上苑，车如流水马如龙。”“想得玉楼瑶殿影，空照秦淮。”等等。难道这些就叫做想念人民、代表进步吗？恰恰相反，这些词证明李煜所想念的不是人民，而是自身的荣辱；所留恋的不是进步，而是宫廷生活。如果这些就可以证明他是爱祖国、爱人民，那末，每一个悲叹王位丧失的皇帝，每一个悲叹豪华生活破灭的贵族，就都是爱祖国、爱人民的人物了！
    有些评论家索性断定李煜的词始终具有人民性。比如楚子同志在“李后主及其作品评价”（“文学遗产”74期）中说：李煜早期写出的许多描写真挚爱情生活的诗篇，是超乎统治阶级情感的。吴颖同志也认为李煜前期的词，“共同的思想感情的特点是认真严肃、一往情深”。“这样的思想感情，一方面和统治阶级的没落颓废的思想感情有所区别，另一方面，却是通向人民的思想感情的”。歌唱了“真挚爱情生活”，是否一定就超乎统治阶级情感，我们也姑置不论。但是，李煜的行为和作品，又怎样能证明他的“真挚爱情生活”呢？李煜的“好声色”是历史上著名的。而他早期的作品中的“晚妆初了明肌雪”，“金雀钗，红粉面”，“佳人舞点金钗溜”，“春睡觉，晚妆残，凭谁整翠鬟”，“烂嚼红茸，笑向檀郎唾”，“奴为出来难，教君恣意怜”一类词句，确实是可以同“好声色”的断语互相印证的。很难了解，人们为什么可以从这些词句里，看出什么“真挚爱情生活”和“认真严肃”的“人民性”。
    认为李煜被俘后的作品具有人民性的人更多了，而且不少人认为李煜作品的人民性从此是达到了进一步的高度。楚子同志说：它们的“充满着孤独、寂寞、悔恨和凄凉的情调”的内容，“在客观上已经突破了自己的身世和经历”；那些诗句并不与李煜的经历、事迹完全吻合，而是与黑暗的封建社会统治下不幸的人民，“与黑暗现实决裂的战士们”，“相类似相沟通”。楚子同志甚至还认为，由于社会矛盾空前尖锐，封建社会走入下坡路，人们在失望中就不得不“回顾、眷恋”过去。游国恩同志也说，李煜当时所感受到的东西，“也正是当时人民所共同感到的东西”。吴颖同志说，被俘后的李煜是用囚徒的感觉和理解去思考问题，因而“懂得了一些新的生活真理”，“更深刻地感到故国的可爱”；李煜“在作囚徒的经历中不但能体会到国亡的悲痛，而且能够深刻地体味到丧失自由的囚徒的悲痛。从亡国的悲痛到丧失自由的悲痛，意味着李煜词的人民性达到进一步的高度”。这些意见里虽然安上了一连串新的现代的术语，实质上却无非重复了王国维的“人间词话”的论断。王国维认为李煜降宋以后的作品，“俨有释迦基督担荷人类罪恶之意”。但是事实真的是如此吗？
    现存的李煜的词，包括可能是别人作的在内，总共只有40多首，大致可以确定是被俘后所写的不过十多首。这些词像上面所已经说过的，大都是对于自己旧日宫廷的繁华生活的眷恋，是对于这些欢乐生活的失去的哀悼，是对于囚徒生活的悲愁。这些同“人民性”有什么关系呢？所谓文学作品的人民性，基本的内容应该是反映当时广大人民的思想、感情、愿望和要求，反映他们的利益。但是，李煜的词是不是反映了人民的思想感情等等呢？人民是不是因为祖国的统一反而觉得国破家亡？人民是不是在追想着自己的上苑、宫娥和妓女的胭脂泪？人民在封建统治下是被压迫的，是要求自由的，但是，李煜的哪一首词表达了人民的这种求自由的愿望？他在什么地方表现了他同黑暗现实的决裂，同反封建的战士们的“沟通”？如果说他是在忏悔，他又在哪一首词里忏悔了他在南京的淫靡的生活？他恨，他主要地是恨他“一晌贪欢”的生活太匆匆，像流水落花一样地去而不复返罢了！
    这一切本来都是很清楚的。问题是在：为什么李煜的词却在近千年间受到许多读者的爱好？
    李煜的词的所以受人爱好，首先是因为在他被俘后的作品中所流露的哀愁，尽管在实质上同人民的哀愁不一样，在某些方面却有一种类似。李煜的读者往往并不把他看作一个被俘的皇帝，甚至并不了解他是一个被俘的皇帝。他们既不注意他所悼惜的昨日的玉楼瑶殿，也不注意他所感伤的今日的珠泪罗衾，这些都不是一般读者所能有的。他们只是被“独自莫凭栏，无限江山，别时容易见时难。”“问君能有几多愁？恰似一江春水向东流！”这种对于人生的咏叹所感动。旧时代的各种不幸者、没落者、远离故乡的人们以及暂时丧失祖国的人们，可以从李煜的这些感伤的词句中找到自己的精神上的同伴。李煜的有几首词并没有涉及丧失王位者的特殊的悲哀，这些词也就更能引起广泛的共鸣。例如：
    无言独上西楼，月如钩，寂寞梧桐深院锁清秋。剪不断，理还乱。是离愁，别是一般滋味在心头。（相见欢）
    闲梦远，南国正清秋：千里江山寒色暮，芦花深处泊孤舟。笛在月明楼。（忆江南）
    只要不对这些作品的意义作不应有的夸大，那么，人们对于这些作品的爱好本来是容易理解的。尽管“寂寞梧桐深院”和“芦花深处孤舟”的境界不会在任何时代都能引起同样的联想，都保有同等的吸引力。但是，只要人们在离开所爱者和熟悉的土地的时候感觉眷恋和痛苦，他们就会感谢李煜精细地写出了他们的这种心情。在这里，我们既不需要假定李煜是为人民而写作，也不应该否认在他的整个作品中，他的感情同人民的感情、他的哀愁同人民的哀愁，在实质上完全是两回事。
    必须指出，李煜的后期作品中有着悲观的气氛。这对于他是很自然的；而这种悲观气氛在旧时代曾经感染了许多读者的事实，也是很自然的。当然，在任何时代，人民都需要乐观的奋斗者；但是在过去，欣赏和接受“人生长恨水长东”的哲学，对于不幸者究竟是很容易的。有些人并非不幸者，但是，他们的愿望也常常不能满足，他们的快乐也常常不能久留，所以他们也愿意皈依这种廉价的悲观主义。可是，时代是变化了。新时代的广大的青年正在满怀信心地用劳动创造着自己的幸福，对于他们，世界不是今不如昔，而是昔不如今。因此，向今天的青年推销这种“人生长恨水长东”的“深刻”的公式，就不会那么容易了。热心于推销这一套的人们，也就不能不受到舆论的正当的怀疑和责备……
    李煜的词的所以受人爱好，还因为这些作品具有高度的艺术技巧。在词这种抒情短诗的历史上，应该承认李煜的成就是卓越的。在李煜的许多词中，一切的描写都很自然，没有雕琢的痕迹。李煜的语言，特别是在后期的作品中，一般地是朴素、清新、洗练和准确的，很少陈词滥调和矫揉捏作。在这一点上，他同温庭筠等人有显然的区别。在晚唐、五代许多词人惯于堆砌绮词丽句的风气中，这种倾向不能不说是可贵的。李煜善于抓住那些使人们能清晰地感受和想像的事物特征，善于选取确切生动的形象作比喻，因而能运用很少的词句描画出鲜明动人的情境。李煜的这种艺术技巧是我国的诗史上的重要遗产，在现在对于我国的诗歌艺术仍然没有失去它的意义。
    但是应该指出，李煜的艺术成就也有很大的局限性。李煜对于现实生活的兴味和了解是非常狭窄和浮浅的。诚如王国维所说：他“生于深宫之中，长于妇人之手”，因此，他的初期的作品所写的固然几乎全部是宫廷和妓院中的女人，就是在他的后期的作品中，他所回忆的和感慨的对象也仍然非常单纯，以至经常互相重复。人们从他那里看到许多的梦、泪、愁，而不容易看到生活（包括作者自己的精神生活）的更丰富的表现。王国维说：“客观之诗人不可不多阅世，阅世愈深则材料愈丰富愈变化；水浒传红楼梦之作者是也。主观之诗人不必多阅世，阅世愈浅则性情愈真；李后主是也。”这个唯心主义的赞词，反过来恰好构成了正确的贬词。李煜的这个弱点，也是历代多数“词人”的共同的弱点。
    人们为什么会对于李煜的词进行这样多的讨论，并且难于得到解决呢？原因之一，是人们觉得，既然是要当作文学遗产来接受的东西，必然是具有爱国主义和人民性的东西。但是，马克思主义并没有立过这样一个公式。近几年来，人们对于我国古典文学的兴趣增高了，对于我国古典文学的研究，不少的人都企图运用新的观点和方法，这都是令人鼓舞的现象。可是对待古典文学，至今还有这样一种严重情况，即是简单提出几个概念，比如人民性、民族思想、爱国主义、人道主义等等，去审查作品，合乎这些要求就是好作品，否则就是坏作品；或者任意用这几个概念去肯定、解释作品，而不管是否合乎作品的实际。这种作法是错误的。因为反映生活的文学，和生活同样地复杂多样，不是几个简单的概念所能包括得了的。且不说一部长篇小说和一首小诗在形式和内容上有怎样的不同，即以形式格律以至字数也完全一样的诗，比如五言律诗而论吧，可以有杜甫的“国破山河在，城春草木深”，也可以有王维的“江流天地外，山色有无中”。杜甫的热烈的爱国主义的情感自然是好的，但是，王维对自然景物的优美描写也不能说就没有存在的价值。谁都承认，富有人民性的伟大作品是我们的文学遗产的主体。但是，这决不是说，除了这些作品以外的作品就都是反动的；也不是说，一种作品既有可取，就必须牵强附会，给它硬戴上人民性的帽子。李煜的词就是遭遇着这种牵强附会的许多例子之一。李煜的词是有艺术价值的，并没有特别宣传什么反动的观点，但是，也不应该因此就走到另一个极端，说它们是爱国主义和人民性的作品；同样，李煜并不是一个残暴凶恶的皇帝，但是，也不应该因此就说他是爱国者、不屈服者、进步势力的代表。从关于李煜的讨论看来，在我们的文学研究工作中，特别是在对我国文学遗产的研究工作中，存在着严重的简单化和公式主义的现象，这就是把复杂的文学现象简单化，把马克思主义简单化。结果，代替艰苦繁难的劳动的是几条公式几个术语的套用，既歪曲了文学，更歪曲了马克思主义。有一些人，比如本文所指的吴颖、楚子、游国恩、吴组缃等同志，主观上也是想运用马克思主义的，但是，由于缺乏实事求是的态度，或者还由于偏爱旧的感伤的情调，无分析地同情不幸者，结果不能不违反马克思主义。文学批评中这种简单化和牵强附会的倾向，由于用了一套似是而非的马克思主义的术语，它的为害，也就更大。为了我国的文学研究特别是古典文学的研究的健康发展，这种倾向是应该加以克服的。
