Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st. The Japanese public is worried about the government and ruling party's plans to revise the constitution. Socialist Party member Chiba Shin expressed his suspicion during a question and answer session at the plenary session of the House of Councillors on February 20th, stating that the Japanese government's aim in preparing to revise the current constitution is to pave the way for Japan to participate in the Northeast Asia aggressive alliance, orchestrated by the United States, that includes Japan, South Korea and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama tried his best to conceal the rearmament intentions behind the constitutional revision in his response. He also stated that the Japanese government has absolutely no intention of participating in organizations like the Northeast Asia alliance.

    日本公众担心政府修改宪法
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本公众对政府和执政党修改宪法的计划感到忧虑。社会党议员千叶信2月20日在参议院全体会议上质询时表示，他怀疑日本政府准备修改现行宪法的目的是：为日本参加美国策划的包括日本、南朝鲜和蒋介石集团在内的东北亚侵略联盟铺平道路。
    日本首相鸠山一郎在答辩中竭力掩饰修改宪法的重整军备的目的。他并且说，日本政府丝毫没有参加像东北亚联盟那样的组织的打算。
