Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 15th: 80% to 90% of workers in state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Shenyang are enthusiastically participating in socialist emulation drives.

　　In the competition, state-owned and locally state-owned workers have put forward rationalization proposals and tapped potentials around the weak links and major problems in production. Of the 6,795 rationalization proposals put forward by workers in 19 factories including Shenyang Chemical Plant in January, the vast majority have been adopted and implemented. Nine of the ten key production problems in the first quarter of the 514 workshop of Shenyang Paint Factory have been broken through by the workers.

　　Many engineering and technical personnel have also further exerted their initiative in the competition. The technical personnel of Shenyang Electrical Machinery Plant have improved the design method, and the three vacuum tanks that have been designed can save 60 tons of steel plates.

　　In the competition, more than one-third of the workers in some joint state-private factories have created new records, generally increasing work efficiency by one or two times; some have increased it by more than ten times.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 16th: The Guangzhou Municipal Tap Water Company, a locally state-owned enterprise, and the Huanan Sewing Machine Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, and two other factories have respectively proposed launching inter-factory emulation drives to their counterparts across the country.

　　Guangzhou Tap Water Company proposed completing the first five-year plan seven months ahead of schedule as the condition for initiating the emulation drive, and guaranteed that the labor productivity and total profit in December this year will exceed the 1957 targets by 31.8% and 55.49% respectively; the quality of tap water will gradually meet Soviet standards.

　　Huanan Sewing Machine Factory proposed that the conditions for the competition are: to overfulfill the original plan for two years (1956-1957) within this year, the total production volume, labor productivity will increase by 50% compared with the highest month last year, and the cost will be reduced by another 15% compared with the lowest month last year; in terms of quality, more main parts will be changed to malleable cast iron, and reach secondary precision (difference less than one-tenth of a hair).

　　In addition, Guangdong Gunny Sack Factory, a locally state-owned enterprise, proposed that labor productivity should be increased by 79% compared with last year, and more than 2.5 million gunny sacks should be produced by the end of 1957. Yifeng Enamel Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, proposed to complete this year's production plan two months ahead of schedule, the average pass rate of products should reach 100%, and the cost should be reduced by another 7.98% on the basis of the 14% reduction last year.

    广州四个工厂向全国同行业提出开展厂际竞赛的倡议
    新华社沈阳15日电　沈阳市国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂有80％到90％的职工热烈地参加了社会主义竞赛。
    在竞赛中，国营和地方国营的职工都围绕着生产中的薄弱环节和主要问题提出合理化建议，挖掘潜力。沈阳化工厂等19个工厂的职工在1月份提出的6，795件合理化建议，绝大部分被采纳执行了。沈阳油漆厂五一四车间第一季度生产上的10个关键问题，已被职工突破了9个。
    许多工程技术人员在竞赛中，也进一步发挥了积极性。沈阳电工机械厂的技术人员改进了设计方法，已设计出来的3个真空罐就可节约60吨钢板。
    在竞赛中，有些公私合营工厂有三分之一以上的工人创造了新纪录，一般提高工作效率一倍二倍；有的提高十倍以上。
    新华社广州16日讯　地方国营广州市自来水公司、公私合营华南缝纫机制造厂等4个厂分别向全国同行业提出展开厂际竞赛的倡议。
    广州市自来水公司以提早7个月全面完成第一个五年计划为倡议竞赛的条件，并且保证今年12月份的劳动生产率和利润总额分别超过1957年指标的31.8％和55.49％；自来水质量逐步达到苏联标准。
    华南缝纫机制造厂倡议竞赛的条件是：在今年内超额完成原定计划两年（1956—1957年）的生产总量，劳动生产率比去年最高月份提高50％，成本比去年最低月份再降低15％；在质量方面，主要零件更多改用可锻铸铁，并且达到二级精度（相差不及一根头发的十分之一）。
    此外，地方国营广东麻袋厂提出劳动生产率要比去年提高79％，到1957年底增产麻袋250万条以上。公私合营益丰搪瓷厂提出提早两个月完成今年度生产计划，产品正品率平均达到100％，成本在去年已降低14％的基础上再降低7.98％。
