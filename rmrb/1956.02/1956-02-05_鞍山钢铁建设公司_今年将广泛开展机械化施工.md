Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company

This Year to Widely Implement Mechanized Construction

In order to accelerate the construction speed of Anshan Iron and Steel and complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company will, on the principle of making full use of existing equipment, further expand mechanized construction this year.

According to the Anshan Iron and Steel 1956 Engineering Mechanization Plan, the mechanization level in earthwork engineering will reach 67% this year, an increase of 31% over last year. Concrete mixing work and the installation of metal structures, prefabricated components, and mechanical equipment will be basically mechanized. The mechanization level of concrete tamping will reach 90%. The mechanization level of plastering, painting, and whitewashing will also reach 50% to 70% respectively. In addition, vigorous efforts will be made to develop small-scale construction mechanization. Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company has formulated a production plan for 31 types of small machinery and equipment and a plan for 12 measures to improve mechanical efficiency.

In order to ensure the early completion of this year's Anshan Iron and Steel construction tasks, various newly ordered construction machinery have arrived one after another. China's first domestically made 25-ton tower crane has begun installation. A 40-ton tower crane manufactured in the German Democratic Republic has also been transported to Anshan. A small excavator has begun operation, solving the mechanization problem of small-scale earth excavation. (Feng Shiming)

    鞍山钢铁建设公司
    今年将广泛开展机械化施工
    鞍山钢铁建设公司为了加快鞍钢的建设速度，提前完成五年计划，今年将在充分利用现有设备的原则下，更进一步广泛地开展机械化施工。
    根据鞍钢1956年工程机械化规划规定，今年在土方工程方面的机械化水平，将达到67％，比去年提高31％。混凝土搅拌工作和金属结构、预制构件、机械设备的安装工作等，将基本上实现机械化。混凝土捣固工作的机械化水平将达到90％。抹灰、油漆、粉刷等工程的机械化水平也将分别达到50％到70％。此外还将大力开展施工小型机械化。鞍山钢铁建设公司已经制定了31种小型机具的制作计划和12种提高机械效率的措施计划。
    为了保证提前完成今年鞍钢建设任务，各种新订建筑机械已经纷纷到货。我国自制的第一台25吨塔式起重机已经开始安装。德意志民主共和国制造的起重40吨的塔式起重机也已经运到鞍山。一种小型挖土机已经开始工作，它解决了少量土方挖掘的机械化问题。　　　　（冯世明）
