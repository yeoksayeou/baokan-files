    Over 12,000 people from more than 5,000 households in Shanghai have volunteered to reclaim wasteland in Jiangxi Province from mid-October of last year to the present. Currently, these land reclamation personnel have been settled in six counties in Jiangxi Province, including Fuliang, De'an, Fengxin, and Anfu. The majority have joined local agricultural producers' cooperatives, while a small number have established 20 agricultural producers' cooperatives themselves. Local Party and government officials and farmers have warmly accommodated and assisted these land reclamation personnel.
    Currently, these land reclamation personnel are working with local farmers to actively engage in winter plowing, manure accumulation, and water conservancy projects. (Our Shanghai Correspondent)

    上海市一万多人到江西省垦荒
    从去年10月中旬到现在，上海市有5，000多户12，000多人到江西省志愿垦荒。目前，这些垦荒人员已经被分别安置在江西省的浮梁、德安、奉新、安福等6个县，大部分都加入了当地的农业生产合作社，一小部分自办了20个农业生产合作社。当地党、政负责干部和农民们都热情地安置和帮助这些垦荒人员。
    现在，这些垦荒人员正在同当地农民一道，积极冬耕、积肥和兴修水利工程。　（本报驻上海记者）
