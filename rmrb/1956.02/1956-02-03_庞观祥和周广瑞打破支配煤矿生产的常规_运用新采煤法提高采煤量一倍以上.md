    Pang Guanxiang and Zhou Guangrui Break Conventions Governing Coal Mine Production, Employing New Coal Mining Method to Increase Coal Production by More Than Double

    (Our report) Fushun Tiger Terrace Mine's Sixth Mining District workers Pang Guanxiang and technician Zhou Guangrui broke the conventions that have long governed coal mine production and created a new coal mining method. The result of coal miners trying this new coal mining method is that each shift increased from the original 400 tons of coal to 987 tons. According to the calculations of engineering and technical personnel, if coal is mined under normal coal seam geological conditions, the output of coal per shift can reach at least 1,300 tons.
    This new coal mining method reformed the technical standards and labor organization in several basic aspects of coal mining, increasing the original drilling depth of the coal seam from 1.8 meters to 2.2 meters, increasing the original mining height limited to 2.2 meters to 2.5 meters, and also increasing the amount of gunpowder used. In this way, the volume of the coal seam blasted each time is greatly increased compared to the past. In the past, coal mining was done by mixed trade mining teams going down the well together and working at the same time. Now they organize specialized work teams to go down the well in batches to implement cross-flow operations and expand the 80-meter coal mining face to 160 meters. In this way, coal miners can more fully utilize their working time. After more than 10 days of testing, it has been proven that if this method is vigorously promoted, the coal seam originally planned to be mined in two and a half years in the entire mining area can be mined one year ahead of schedule. Maintenance costs for roadways alone can be saved by 240,000 yuan. At the same time, due to changes in the pillar method, the safety of coal mining is more guaranteed. Currently, this new coal mining method is being studied and summarized.

    庞观祥和周广瑞打破支配煤矿生产的常规
    运用新采煤法提高采煤量一倍以上
    本报讯　抚顺老虎台矿第六采煤区工人庞观祥和技术员周广瑞打破长久以来支配煤矿生产的常规，创造出一种新的采煤方法。采煤工人试用这种新采煤法的结果，每班由原来采煤400吨提高到987吨。根据工程技术人员的推算，如果在煤层地质正常的条件下采煤，每班煤的产量至少可以达到1，300吨。
    这种新的采煤方法是在采煤的几个基本环节上改革了技术标准和劳动组织，把原来煤层的打眼深度由1.8公尺提高到2.2公尺，把原来局限在2.2公尺内的采高提高到2.5公尺，火药用量也加大了。这样，每爆破一次的煤层体积，比过去大大增加了。过去采煤时，是由混合工种采煤队一齐下井，同时作业，现在他们组织专业工作队，分批下井实行交叉流水作业，并把80公尺的采煤掌子面扩大到160公尺。这样，就使采煤工人能更充分利用作业时间。经过10多天的试验，证明这种方法如果大力推广，全采煤区原计划两年半采完的煤层可以提前一年采完。仅巷道维修费就可以节省24万元。同时由于改变了支柱办法，采煤的安全就更有了保证。现在，这种新的采煤方法正在研究和总结中。
