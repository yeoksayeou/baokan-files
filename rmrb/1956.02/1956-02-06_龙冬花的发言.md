Chairman, fellow committee members:

I am overjoyed to be here in Beijing to attend this conference. I express my warm support for Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and Vice Chairman Li Jishen's work report.

My name is Long Donghua, and I am the head of the Xingfu (Happiness) Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liucun Township, Guichi County, Anhui Province. I am also the family member of a revolutionary soldier. In the old society, I suffered countless hardships. After liberation, I was emancipated. In the six years since, I have witnessed the daily changes in the countryside: the overthrow of the reactionaries, the implementation of land reform, and the development of mutual aid and cooperation. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have led us step by step onto the happy road of socialism. Recalling the pain of the past and seeing the care, cultivation, and education that the Party and the government have given me today, I am filled with gratitude and am constantly responding to the Party's call, willing to dedicate all my strength to building socialism.

Since liberation, I have actively participated in the struggle of land reform. After being emancipated through land reform, I immediately responded to Chairman Mao's call and took the lead in organizing mutual aid teams. In the spring of 1954, we organized an agricultural production cooperative. That summer, our area suffered the worst flood in a century. I organized the young and strong members of the cooperative to lead the young and strong members of the surrounding mutual aid teams to reclaim wasteland in the mountains, while actively participating in rescuing and resettling disaster victims. I rode a wooden boat deep into the center of the dike, amid the raging wind, rain, and towering waves, rescuing seven households, comprising 22 elderly people, women, and children, who were stranded on rooftops. I also saved 1,000 jin of wheat and two pigs. With the vigorous rescue efforts of the Party and the government, no one was swept away. The rescued disaster victims were given relief and resettlement, and after the water receded, the government helped the farmers rebuild their homes. In the winter, there was unprecedented heavy snow, and the government promptly provided relief in the form of clothing, blankets, and grain, ensuring that no one froze or starved to death. The farmers' gratitude to the Party and the government is indescribable. Everyone experienced in the flood that only under the leadership of the Party and the government, and only by organizing, can we overcome disasters. Everyone actively demanded to join mutual aid and cooperative organizations. By winter, our township had established more than 30 mutual aid teams and two cooperatives and actively participated in repairing dikes and embankments. I also led the women of the cooperative and the mutual aid teams onto the dikes. Under the leadership of the Party, I continuously studied and improved labor methods with everyone, helped the workers solve difficulties, and improved labor efficiency. At the end of the work, I was rated as a special-class labor model.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, we overcame the great flood, rebuilt the dikes, installed pumping stations in the low-lying areas, and developed mutual aid and cooperation. In 1955, tens of thousands of mu of low-lying land were planted with rice, yielding 700-800 jin per mu. Our township's 900 mu of cotton also generally yielded a bumper harvest, averaging 200 jin of unginned cotton per mu, with our cooperative reaching 230 jin.

Last autumn, after Chairman Mao's instructions on the question of agricultural cooperation were disseminated, the farmers poured into the cooperatives like a tide, like a great storm, who doesn't want to move towards socialism early! Our Xingfu (Happiness) cooperative expanded from 12 households to 40 households, and quickly expanded to 200 households, and later merged into a large cooperative of 405 households, and is now transforming into an advanced cooperative. The masses' confidence in transitioning to advanced cooperatives is even higher than when they were establishing elementary cooperatives.

Last year, when I came to Beijing to participate in the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction of Youth, I challenged my husband, who is in the Air Force, to run the cooperative well, improve production, improve my cultural level, and continue to maintain my title of labor model. Recently, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956 to 1967," which has given us a guiding light. This time I go back, I am determined to work with all the members of the cooperative, and we must guarantee the early realization of this great program (draft) and strive to build a happy and fulfilling socialist society!

    龙冬花的发言
    主席、各位委员：
    我能到北京来参加这次会议，心里有说不出的高兴。听了周恩来主席的政治报告和李济深副主席的工作报告，表示热烈的拥护。
   我叫龙冬花，是安徽省贵池县柳村乡幸福农业生产合作社的社长，又是一个革命军人家属。在旧社会里我受了不知多少的苦难。解放了，翻了身。六年多来，我亲眼看到，农村中天天在变化：打倒了反动派，实行了土地改革，发展了互助合作，共产党和毛主席把我们一步一步地领导上了社会主义的幸福道路。想起了过去的痛苦，看到今天党和政府对我的爱护、培养和教育，我怀着万分感激的心情，时时刻刻都在响应党的号召，愿为建设社会主义，献出我的一切力量。
    解放以来，我积极参加了土地改革的斗争。土改翻身后，立即响应毛主席的号召带头组织了互助组。1954年春天我们又组织了一个农业生产合作社。这年夏天，我们那里遭到了百年来未有的大水灾。我一面组织社里的青壮年带动周围互助组的青壮年到山地去开荒，一面积极参加抢救和安置灾民。我乘着一只木船，在大风大雨白浪滔天里，深入到圩中心，抢救出七户爬在屋顶上的22个老人、妇女和小孩。还有1，000斤小麦和两口猪。在党和政府的大力抢救下，没有漂走一个人。对抢出的灾民，进行了救济和安置，水退后，政府又帮助农民重建了家园。冬天下了从来未有过的大雪，政府又及时救济了衣服、被子和粮款，没有冻死、饿死一个人。农民们对党和政府的感谢是难以形容的。大家都在水灾中体验到只有在党和政府的领导下，只有组织起来，才能战胜灾荒，都积极要求参加互助合作组织。到冬季我们一个乡就办起了30多个互助组，两个合作社。并积极参加了修圩筑堤。我也带领社里和互助组的妇女上了堤。在党的领导下，我不断和大家研究改进劳动办法，帮助民工解决困难，提高了劳动效率。收工时我被评为特等劳动模范。
    在党和政府领导下战胜了大水灾，重新修了堤圩，洼地上安上了抽水机站，发展了互助合作。1955年，几万亩洼地都种上了水稻，每亩收了7、8百斤。我乡900亩棉花，也都普遍得到丰收，每亩平均收籽棉200斤，我们合作社达到230斤。
    去年秋天，毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”指示传下以后，农民们就像潮水一样拥进合作社里来，真像一个大风暴，那个不想早走到社会主义！我们幸福社，由12户扩大到40户，很快又扩大到200户，后来又合并成为一个405户的大社，现在正向高级社转变。群众对转高级社的信心，比办初级社时还高。
    去年我到北京来参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会时，就和我在空军的丈夫挑了战，我要办好社、搞好生产、提高文化，继续保持我的劳动模范称号。最近中共中央政治局提出了“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”，又给我们点了一盏指路的明灯。我这次回去，决心和全体社员在一起，一定要保证提早实现这个伟大的纲要草案，为建成美满的社会主义社会而奋斗！
