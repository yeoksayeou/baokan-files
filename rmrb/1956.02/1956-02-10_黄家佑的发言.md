Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

    After listening to Premier Zhou's political report and the reports of the leading comrades, I feel very encouraged and express my warm support.

    I am a primary school educator and one of the younger people attending this conference, being 19 years old this year. This time, I came from the remote southwestern frontier of the motherland to the capital of the motherland—Beijing—to participate in the National Political Consultative Conference. At the meeting, I once again saw our beloved leader Chairman Mao, and I feel incredibly excited and infinitely honored. I think that only under the leadership of the Party do we minority nationalities have the opportunity to come to the capital of the motherland to discuss national affairs. This was something unimaginable before liberation, and it makes me deeply feel the greatness and warmth of the Party. I am proud to be growing up in this Mao Zedong era, and my heart is filled with unspeakable gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao.

    In the old society, primary school teachers had no political status in society, were looked down upon, and had no future or promise. It is completely different after liberation. The Party has always shown meticulous care and continuous education to primary school teachers, regarding us as one of the state cadres, giving us the political treatment we deserve, and entrusting us with the flowers of mankind and the future generations of the motherland—smart and lively children. This time, I also participated in the National Political Consultative Conference. How much trust the Party and the people have in us! All of this has made me further realize the importance and glory of the task.

    Our country is undergoing rapid and earth-shattering changes, entering socialist society at an incredible pace, just as Chairman Mao said, "is in the midst of a great socialist revolution." Agricultural cooperativization, the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and handicraft cooperativization follow one high tide after another, one victory after another, followed by the soon-to-arrive cultural high tide. Socialism is advancing in such big strides, but we intellectuals, both in quantity and quality, are still unable to meet the needs of the socialist cause. In order to adapt to the rapidly developing needs of socialism, the self-remolding of us intellectuals is indeed an extremely urgent issue. We should adopt an active attitude of being masters of our own affairs to carry out self-remolding, overcome shortcomings, transform the bourgeois thinking cultivated in the old era into the progressive thinking of the working class, demand ourselves according to the standards of a Communist Party member, and contribute all useful knowledge without reservation to the great motherland, so as to realize a socialist society as soon as possible.

    My political and cultural level are quite low, but after this study, I have clearly seen the bright future and beautiful prospects of the motherland. I have the confidence and determination to improve my political and cultural level in a short period of time to complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the people. Now let me make the following guarantees:

    (1) After returning, I will definitely strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, humbly learn from the older generation, learn from people with experience and knowledge, and learn from the masses; guard against arrogance and rashness to improve my political and cultural level.

    (2) I am now a member of the Communist Youth League, and I will actively create conditions to strive to join the Party as soon as possible, to make myself stronger and worthy of the glorious title of people's teacher.

    (3) We must unite the fraternal nationalities in the border areas, raise revolutionary vigilance, and jointly guard the gates of the border, and never allow any enemies to undermine our happy life.

    Finally, I wish the comrades good health and the conference a complete success.

    黄家佑的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听了周总理的政治报告和各位首长的报告后，感到非常振奋，并且表示热烈拥护。
    我是一个小学教育工作者，是参加这次大会年纪较小的人，今年19岁。这次从祖国遥远的西南边疆，来到祖国的首都——北京参加全国政治协商会议。在会上，又一次的见到了敬爱的领袖毛主席，我感到无比的兴奋，无限的光荣。我想也只有在党的领导下，我们少数民族才有机会到祖国的首都商量国家大事。这是解放前所梦想不到的，使我深深感到党的伟大、党的温暖。我正以生长在这毛泽东时代而感到自豪，我的内心，对党对毛主席有说不出的感激。
    在旧社会里，小学教师在社会上是没有政治地位的，是被人看不起的，也是无前途无出息的。解放后完全不同了，党对小学教师一直是无微不至的关怀，不断的教育，把我们看作国家干部之一，给予我们应有的政治待遇，并且把人类的花朵、祖国的后代——聪明活泼的儿童交给我们。这次又参加了全国政治协商会议，党和人民是多么的信任我们啊！这一切使我进一步的认识到任务的重大和光荣。
    我们的国家正日新月异地以一日千里的速度进入社会主义社会，正如毛主席所说的“正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中”。农业合作化、私营工商业的社会主义改造、手工业合作化一个高潮紧接一个高潮，一个胜利紧接一个胜利，接着快要到来的就是文化高潮。社会主义是这样大踏步的前进着，但是我们知识分子，无论在数量上质量上都还不能适应社会主义事业的需要。为了能够适应社会主义急速发展的需要，我们知识分子的自我改造，的确是一个极其迫切的问题。我们应该抱着积极的主人翁的态度，来进行自我改造，克服缺点，把旧时代培植下来的资产阶级思想转变为工人阶级的进步思想，以共产党员的条件来要求自己，把一切有用的知识丝毫不保留地贡献给伟大的祖国，早日实现社会主义社会。
    我的政治水平、文化水平都相当低，但是经过了这次的学习，看清楚了祖国光明的前途和美丽的远景。我有信心有决心在短期内提高自己的政治和文化水平，来完成党和人民交给的任务。现在让我提出以下保证：
    （1）回去以后，一定加强马克思列宁主义的学习，虚心的向老一辈学习，向有经验有学问的人学习，向群众学习；戒骄戒躁，来提高自己的政治和文化水平。
    （2）我现在是个青年团员，我要积极创造条件，争取早日入党，把自己锻炼得更坚强，无愧于光荣的人民教师。
    （3）要团结边疆的兄弟民族，提高革命警惕性，共同看守边疆的大门，决不允许任何敌人来破坏我们的幸福生活。
    最后，祝同志们身体健康，祝大会胜利成功。
