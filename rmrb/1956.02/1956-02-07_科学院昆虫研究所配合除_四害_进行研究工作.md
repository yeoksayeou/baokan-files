The Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in order to cooperate with the work of eliminating flies and mosquitoes in the "Four Pests" campaign, will conduct research on the drug resistance of houseflies, the classification of flies, and research on mosquitoes this year.

After repeated use of certain drugs on a particular pest, the pest often develops resistance to the drugs used. This problem has already occurred in China's use of 666 to control mosquitoes and flies. In response to this problem, the Institute of Entomology has formulated a plan titled "Research on the Resistance of Houseflies to DDT and 666." They will gradually study how this resistance is formed and the changes in the physiology and morphology of houseflies when resistance is formed. The research results will serve as an important basis for the control of such resistant houseflies.

In the work of eliminating flies, the investigation of various types of flies is very necessary. However, due to a lack of understanding of the classification and distribution of common disease-carrying flies, the investigation work has been affected. Now, the Institute of Entomology has determined a plan titled "Classification Research on Common Flies in Shanghai and Other Regions of China." They will classify existing specimens and specimens that may be collected in Shanghai and other regions of China, and summarize them in conjunction with relevant literature for reference when identifying flies in various parts of the country.

One species of mosquito, *Anopheles sinensis*, is widely distributed in China and is closely related to the spread of diseases. However, its breeding habits vary from place to place, and different types of the same species are of great significance to disease transmission and prevention work. The Institute of Entomology has already done some work on this issue in the past and now plans to further study the types of *Anopheles sinensis* in Hangzhou and nearby representative areas, to clarify the different breeding habits of these types and their relationship to disease transmission.

    科学院昆虫研究所配合除“四害”进行研究工作
    中国科学院昆虫研究所，为了配合除“四害”中灭蝇、灭蚊的工作，今年将进行家蝇对药剂抗性的研究、蝇类的分类研究以及关于蚊类的研究等工作。
    多次对某种害虫使用一定的药剂，这种害虫常常会对所用药剂发生抵抗力量。目前我国使用666防治蚊子、苍蝇的过程中，已经发生这个问题。昆虫研究所针对这个问题，拟定了以“家蝇对滴滴涕、666抗性的研究”为题的计划。他们将逐步研究这种抗性是怎样形成的，以及抗性形成时家蝇在生理、形态等方面的改变情况。研究结果将作为防治这类有抗性的家蝇的重要根据。
    在灭蝇工作中，对各项蝇类的调查工作很必需，但由于对常见病媒性蝇类的分类、分布情况缺乏了解，影响了调查工作。现在昆虫研究所确定了以“上海和国内其他地区常见蝇类的分类研究”为题的计划。他们将把上海和国内其他地区常见蝇类的现有标本以及可能采到的标本，进行分类，结合有关文献加以总结，以供国内各地鉴别蝇类的时候参考。
    蚊子的一个种类“中华按蚊”在国内分布很广，和传播疾病很有关系，但是它的孳生习性，各地情况不相同，而且同种的不同类型和传染疾病以及防治工作有很大关系。昆虫研究所过去已经就这个问题做了一些工作，现在计划进一步研究杭州和附近有代表性地区的“中华按蚊”的类型，弄清楚这些类型的不同孳生习性，以及疾病的传染关系。
