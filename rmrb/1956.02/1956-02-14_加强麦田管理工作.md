    Strengthen Wheat Field Management
    Wang Zhimin
    Last year, there was excessive rainfall in the north and drought in the south during the wheat sowing season. Generally, sowing was not timely, fertilizer application in wheat fields was insufficient, and the quality of sowing was also poor, resulting in uneven emergence of seedlings. According to a survey of six villages in the Gu Zhao Township, Li Jian District, Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, out of 967 mu of wheat fields, 419 mu had wheat seedlings with some yellow tips and roots that were not robust enough. A total of 93 mu had sparse and weak roots, yellow and red wheat seedlings, and some even had withered plants. In more than 40 new and old agricultural cooperatives in Gao Zheng Township, Feidong County, Anhui Province, the wheat seedlings planted urgently to combat drought did not emerge well. In the Qigan cooperative, one-third of the 561 mu of wheat fields had no seedlings. In particular, last winter, there was little rain and snow in various places, which was very unfavorable for the growth and overwintering of wheat seedlings. According to meteorological station records, Shangqiu Prefecture in Henan Province only had 4.4 mm of rainfall in October last year and 2 mm of rainfall in November. In the northern sandy loam areas of the province, the soil moisture content was only 8%-9% at a depth of 3 to 6 inches below the surface. The drought was even more severe in the southern clay areas, with red wheat leaves and scorched leaf tips. Due to the drought, wheat seedlings had very few tillers. In the Jinghui Canal irrigation area of Shaanxi Province, the number of tillers by late November last year was 41% less than in the same period of the previous year. In the Meihui Canal irrigation area, wheat had fully tillered by late October the year before, while last year, tillering at the same time only reached 48.7% of the previous year. Therefore, strengthening wheat field management and leading agricultural production cooperatives and the vast number of farmers to effectively carry out topdressing, irrigation, hoeing, and harrowing work is of great significance for ensuring the completion of this year's wheat production increase task.
    In areas with irrigation conditions, wheat fields that have not been watered in winter should be irrigated in the spring. In areas with relatively dry soil, spring irrigation can be brought forward to the time when wheat turns green. This will not only meet the water requirements for wheat growth but also prevent and reduce frost damage. In dryland wheat fields, attention should be paid to preserving soil moisture. Harrowing should be carried out in early spring when the soil has just thawed to maintain soil moisture and reduce weed growth. Topdressing is also an important measure. Especially since basal fertilizer application in wheat fields last year was generally insufficient, this work should be stepped up. Applying some quick-acting fertilizers in early spring has a great effect on increasing wheat production. In the north, the utilization of human urine should be emphasized. 1,000 jin of human urine contains about five jin of nitrogen, which is roughly equivalent to the fertilizer effect of 25 jin of ammonium sulfate. It decomposes quickly in the soil and is easily absorbed by wheat seedlings, so it should be vigorously promoted.

    加强麦田管理工作
    王志民
    去年播种小麦的时候，北方雨水多，南方干旱，一般播种都不及时，麦田施肥不多，播种质量也较差，因而出苗不整齐。根据在江苏省兴化县李健区顾赵乡6个村的调查，967亩麦田中，麦苗带有少数黄尖，根棵不够肥壮的就有419亩；根棵既稀且瘦，麦苗发黄发红，个别还有枯死现象的共有93亩。安徽省肥东县高郑乡40多个新老农业合作社，抗旱抢种的小麦出苗都不好，旗杆社561亩麦田就有三分之一的麦田没有出苗。特别是去年冬天，各地雨雪稀少，对麦苗生长和越冬很不利。据气象站记载，河南省商丘专区去年10月份仅降雨4.4公厘，11月份降雨2公厘。这个省的北部沙壤地区麦田地表3寸以下到6寸深仅含水8％—9％；南部粘土地区干旱更加严重，麦叶发红，叶尖枯焦。因为干旱，麦苗分蘖很少，陕西省泾惠渠灌溉区的小麦截至去年11月下旬，分蘖株数比前年同期少41％；梅惠渠灌溉区的小麦在前年10月下旬已全部分蘖，而去年同时期分蘖仅达前年的48.7％。因此，加强麦田管理，领导农业生产合作社和广大农民切实做好追肥、灌溉、锄耙等工作，对保证完成今年小麦增产任务有很重要的意义。
    在有灌溉条件的地区，没有浇冬水的麦田应该灌春水，土壤比较干燥的可将春水提早到小麦返青时浇，这不但能满足小麦生长所需的水分，还可以防止和减轻冻害。干旱地区的麦田应该注意保墒，在早春土壤刚化冻时就要进行耙地，以保持土壤水分和减少杂草生长。追肥也是一项重要措施。特别在去年麦田基肥一般都不充足的情况下，更应该抓紧做好这个工作。早春追施一些速效性肥料，对小麦增产作用很大。在北方，要强调对人尿的利用，1，000斤人尿含氮五斤左右，差不多相当于25斤硫铵的肥效，浇在地里分解很快，容易被麦苗吸收，应该大力提倡。
