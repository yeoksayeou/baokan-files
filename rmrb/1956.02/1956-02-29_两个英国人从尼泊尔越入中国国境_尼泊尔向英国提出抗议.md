Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 27th - According to a Press Trust of India report from Kathmandu on the 26th: The Nepalese Foreign Ministry has sent a note to the British Embassy in Nepal, lodging a “strong protest” against the “erroneous behavior” of two Britons who illegally crossed into Chinese territory from Nepal.

    A spokesman for the Nepalese Foreign Ministry said that we demand an unconditional apology from the "Welsh Expedition."

    The spokesman also said: "We cannot allow anyone to gain a commanding observation post to spy on our friendly neighbors who don't like people peeking through their windows."

    The two Britons illegally crossed into Chinese territory in October 1955 and were detained by Chinese border troops. After they admitted their mistake, China released them and sent them out of the country in December of the same year.

    尼泊尔向英国提出抗议
    新华社新德里27日电　据印度报业托辣斯加德满都26日消息：尼泊尔外交部已经通过英国驻尼泊尔大使馆向英国提出照会，“强硬抗议”从尼泊尔非法越入中国国境的两名英国人的“错误行为”。
    尼泊尔外交部发言人说，我们要求“威尔士探险队”无保留地道歉。
    这位发言人还说：“我们不能让任何人获得居高临下的观察站来侦察不喜欢人家从窗口窥视的我们的友邻。”
