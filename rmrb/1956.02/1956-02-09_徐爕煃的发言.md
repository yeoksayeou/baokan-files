    Xu Xiechong's Speech

    Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

    After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's report and the reports from other leading comrades, I not only completely agree but am also greatly encouraged in many respects. I am a mechanical engineer who dreamed of "saving the country through technology" for many years before liberation and did not contribute much to the arduous revolutionary struggle before 1949. Now, seeing that a socialist life is about to arrive, and I will enjoy the fruits of others risking their lives, I feel uneasy and want to contribute more to the construction effort to make up for it. Therefore, I wanted to create new machines and took practical action. Although it is now successful, it took more than five years from design to trial production, progressing very slowly. The main reason for this, of course, is a lack of subjective effort, but environmental conditions also played a considerable role. Just as I was anxiously worried about the slow speed and low effectiveness, I heard Premier Zhou say that our country's long-range plan for science and technology is exactly what people like us have wanted to do for decades, and I felt so happy. Regarding the statement in the plan that we will approach the advanced world level in 12 years, at first glance, I felt that the benchmark was too low, fearing that it would not raise everyone's efforts high enough. Thinking about it carefully, this is just a minimum requirement. And the so-called advanced world level is the advanced world level 12 years from now. We are now aiming to surpass the current world level in our efforts. By that time, others will also have made progress, and we will only be close to it. So, it is not too low. However, it is not too high either. For example, in the department of advanced automatic cutting machine tools, I now have sufficient grounds to guarantee its successful completion. I think other departments are the same. So, all in all, this requirement is neither too high nor too low. I think there must be many engineering and technical personnel like me. So, I would like to make the following statement on behalf of engineering and technical personnel like me:

    We will never stand idly by, but will repeatedly make suggestions;

    We will never walk away, but will fear missing the opportunity again;

    We will never be discouraged, but will be欢欣鼓舞(lit. joyfully encouraged, ie. excited and uplifted).

    徐爕煃的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我听了周恩来主席及各首长报告之后，不只是完全同意，且有很多地方欢欣鼓舞。我是一个机械工程师，解放前曾做过多年“技术救国”的梦，在1949年以前的坚苦革命斗争中没有出过一些力。眼看社会主义生活就要到来，将坐享他人冒了生命危险得来的成果，心中有所不安，很想在建设事业中多出一些力，以补救一些回来。所以就想创造一些新式机器，并且亦实际行动起来，虽然现在是成功了，但从设计起至试成为止共经了五年多的时间，进行得非常之慢。其中主要的原因当然是主观上的不够努力，但环境的条件亦有相当关系。正处在速度太慢、效果太低的焦急之际，今听到周总理说的我们国家的科学技术的远景计划正是我们这一类人数十年心目中想办的事，心中何等的快乐。对计划中12年后接近世界先进水平一语，初看起来，觉得竖标太低，怕对大家努力方向提得不够高。细想一想，这只是一个最低要求。且所谓先进世界水平是12年后的世界先进水平。我们现在对准了超过目前世界水平去努力。到那时候人家也进步了，得到的只不过接近而已。所以提得不低。惟亦不高，如在高级自动削切机床这部门，我现在就有充分的根据敢保证其胜利完成。我想其他部门亦是这样的。所以总起来说，这个要求既不过高，亦不过低。我想，像我这一类型的工程技术人员一定是很多的。所以我就代替我这一类型工程的技术人员作以下表示：
    我们决不冷眼旁观，而是一再建议；
    决不是拂袖而去，而是惟恐再失机会；
    决不是垂头丧气，而是欢欣鼓舞。
