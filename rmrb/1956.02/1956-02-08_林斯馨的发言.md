    Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:
    I represent the nurses of the entire nation in fully supporting Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of the various leaders.
    I am a nurse with 30 years of experience. In the old society, nurses were discriminated against and oppressed, and had no political standing whatsoever. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, nurses can participate in national affairs, and I am extremely excited about this. I wholeheartedly thank the Communist Party, and thank Chairman Mao.
    Listening to Premier Zhou's political report has given us a more comprehensive and complete understanding of the international and domestic situation. The socialist camp is growing stronger day by day, and the demise of imperialism is an inevitable law. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the continuous improvement of the socialist consciousness of the people throughout the country, our country is rapidly and smoothly moving towards socialism. And in this great construction undertaking, the nurses of New China can also play the role of a screw, which makes me feel infinitely honored, excited, and encouraged.
    From the day I chose nursing as my lifelong career, I have never had the idea of changing professions. I have always loved my profession, and I especially love clinical work. I deeply understand that when a patient is groaning in pain in bed, he needs not only medicine and injections, but also physical and mental care, comfort, and protection. Every time I see a patient recover to health, I feel infinite joy. At the same time, under the call of the policy of "prevention first," nurses can play a certain role by conducting health education to patients and their families. Nurses are not only the patient's closest friends, but also the doctor's strong assistants and the masses' health propagandists.
    In the past, when I had not been exposed to new ideas, the service goal of nurses was unclear, and nurses only served a small number of bourgeois people. After liberation, under the education of the Communist Party, we have clarified that the object of our service is the broad masses of working people. Doing a good job in people's health care is an important link in ensuring socialist construction, and we must join other medical workers in undertaking the glorious task of safeguarding the people's health.
    The medical and health plan calls for increasing the number of hospital beds to 837,000 in 12 years, eliminating the "Four Pests," eliminating the nine major diseases, and strengthening the protection of women and children. Undoubtedly, a corresponding increase in the number of nurses is needed to cooperate with the needs of the entire medical prevention and research efforts. At present, nurses are not keeping up with the development of medical and health undertakings, both in terms of quantity and quality. At the same time, due to certain ideological problems among nurses, low work quality, and a lack of necessary systems, accidents and errors continue to occur, and they have not played the role they should. Many patients have prolonged their illness due to not receiving appropriate care; throughout the country, tens of thousands of children suffering from measles die each year due to not receiving proper care. This is a painful fact that deserves our attention!
    Nurses themselves have many shortcomings, and some people still have very serious ideological problems—they are not at ease with their work: some people do not understand the importance of nursing work in medical treatment, and believe that the quality of nursing has little to do with the effect of medical treatment; some people estimate the labor of nurses with the consciousness of the exploiting classes; some people believe that nurses have no future. Therefore, some nurses fundamentally do not love their work, and others become emotionally unstable when they encounter setbacks. These are all remnants of bourgeois ideology, and must not be allowed to exist. Over the years, through the Party's education and training, the phenomenon of not being at ease with work has been reversed, but it still exists relatively seriously. We should also strengthen political study, pay attention to ideological leadership, remove ideological obstacles, and better exert the power of a screw.
    Secondly, the level of professional skill is low. In addition to a lack of subjective effort, family and children's problems also prevent nurses from having enough time to study and improve their skills. Therefore, nursing work is becoming increasingly lagging behind the development of medical science, causing certain difficulties in coordination.
    There are also a series of problems in the training of nurses that may affect the quality of nurses. For example, enrollment is difficult, junior high school graduates are unwilling to study nursing, parents prevent their children from entering nursing schools, and teachers also feel that it is a pity for good students to enter nursing schools. Schools also do have their shortcomings, and many nursing schools do not even have basic equipment. And the teacher problem is even more difficult to solve. Cultural teachers are assigned to nursing schools and become emotional, doctors who teach part-time have no time to prepare lessons, let alone tutor, and believe that giving lectures to nurses is an extra burden, and some classes are taught by intermediate medical officers, which makes students even more dissatisfied. The quality of nursing teachers is low, the teaching plans and teaching methods are poor, and internship locations and internship guidance cannot be properly arranged, etc. In addition, there is relatively little material obtained in learning from the advanced experience of Soviet nursing. In order to improve the quality of nursing, in addition to strengthening subjective efforts, we also hope that leaders and senior medical workers will give more help to nursing work and strengthen leadership and training. In the past, the leaders of the health department did not pay enough attention to nurses, whether in terms of work, treatment, or training. Some doctors look down on nursing work and even undermine the work morale of nurses. Because doctors have not universally established the concept of integrated medical care, and do not regard nursing work as an important part of medical and preventive work, the department director responsibility system is nominal and ineffective, and the quality of nursing work cannot keep up with objective requirements. And nurse comrades with low political consciousness feel that the future of nurses is hopeless, so that they are not at ease with their work, and unconsciously do not love their profession. In the end, patients do not receive appropriate care, and in severe cases, medical errors and accidents occur.
    In recent years, thanks to the concern of the Party and the government for the people's health care cause, the number of nurses has been continuously increasing, and nursing schools in various places have also experienced unprecedented development, but we demand that it develop faster and better. Regarding the quality and quantity of nurses, we hope that the leaders will put forward requirements according to the needs of the 12-year health plan, as the direction of our efforts. Under the strong leadership of the Party and the government, we have the confidence to complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the higher authorities. I am determined to use practical actions in my nursing work to welcome the arrival of the cultural and health upsurge!

    林斯馨的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我代表全国护士完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和各位首长的报告。
    我是有30年工龄的护士。护士在旧社会里是被歧视、被压制的，更没有政治地位。今天，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，护士能参与国家大事，我感到十分兴奋。我衷心感谢共产党，感谢毛主席。
    听了周总理的政治报告，使我们对于国际和国内形势有了更全面而完整的概念。社会主义阵营日益壮大，帝国主义日趋灭亡，这是必然的规律。在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在全国人民社会主义觉悟的不断提高下，我国已在迅速地、顺利地走向社会主义。而在这伟大的建设事业里，新中国的护士也能够起一个螺丝钉的作用，使我更感到无限的光荣、兴奋和鼓舞。
    从我选择护士作为我终身职业的那一日起，我从来没有动过改行的念头。我始终热爱我的职业，我更喜欢临床工作。我深深体会到一个病人在床上呻吟痛苦时，他所需要的不仅是吃药打针，他还需要身体和精神上的照顾、安慰和保护。每见到病人恢复健康时，我就感到无限的快乐，同时在以预防为主的方针号召下，通过护士向患者及其家属进行卫生教育，护士能起到一定的作用。护士不但是病人最亲切的朋友，他还是医师的有力助手和群众的卫生宣传员。
    过去没有接触到新思想时，护士的服务目的是不明确的，护士只是为少数资产阶级服务。解放后，在共产党的教育下，我们已明确了服务的对象是广大的劳动人民。做好人民的卫生保健工作是保证社会主义建设的重要一环，我们要和其他医务工作者一同担当起保卫人民健康的光荣任务。
    医药卫生方面计划在12年里增加病床到837，000张，清除四害，消灭九大疾病和加强对妇婴的保护。无疑的，护士队伍也需要相应的培养来配合整个医疗预防和研究上的需要。目前护士无论在数量或质量上都跟不上医药卫生事业的发展。同时由于护士在思想上还有一定的问题，工作质量低，并缺少应有的制度，因此事故差错不断发生，也没有发挥他应有的作用。不少患者因得不到适当的护理而延长了患病日期；在全国，每年有数以万计的患麻疹的儿童因得不到妥善的护理而死亡。这是惨痛的事实，是值得我们重视的！
    护士本身的缺点很多，有一部分人还存在着很严重的思想问题——不安心工作：有的人不了解护理工作在医疗上的重要性，认为护理质量与医疗效果关系不大；有的人以剥削阶级的意识来估计护士的劳动；有的人认为护士没有前途。因此护士中有根本不热爱自己的工作的，也有遇到不顺利就情绪波动的。这些都是资产阶级的残余思想，绝不能让它存在。数年来经过党的教育和培养，不安心工作的现象已有扭转，但还比较严重的存在着。我们还应当加强政治学习，重视思想领导，除去思想障碍，更好的发挥一个螺丝钉的力量。
    其次就是业务水平低。除了主观不努力外，家庭和孩子的问题也使护士不能有充分的时间来钻研和提高业务。因此护理工作愈来愈落后于医学科学的发展，使工作在配合上发生一定的困难。
    在培养护士方面也存在着一系列的、可能影响护士质量的问题。例如招生困难，初中毕业生不愿意学护士，家长阻碍子女入护士学校，教员也觉得好学生考护士学校是可惜。学校里也确有它的缺点，很多护士学校连基本的设备都没有。而教师问题则更难解决，文化教员被分派到护士学校就闹情绪，医师兼课无暇备课，更无暇辅导，认为给护士讲课是额外的负担，有的课由中级医士来教，学生就更不满意。护理教员的质量低，教学计划和教学方法都较差，实习场所和实习指导不能有妥善的安排等。此外，在学习苏联护理先进经验方面所得的材料也比较少。我们为了提高护理质量，除了应加强主观努力外，更希望领导和高级医务工作者们对护理工作多予帮助，加强领导和培养。过去卫生部门领导上对护士是不够重视的，不论是在工作方面、待遇方面和培养方面。部分医师看不起护理工作，甚至打击护士的工作情绪。由于医师中未能普遍建立起整体医疗的观念，不把护士工作看成医疗预防工作一个重要部分，因此科主任负责制有名无实，护理工作质量跟不上客观要求。而政治觉悟低的护士同志们就感到护士的前途是没有希望的，以致他们在工作上不安心，无形中也就不热爱自己的职业。至终是病人得不到适当的护理，严重的甚至发生医疗差错和事故。
    近几年来，由于党和政府对于人民保健事业的关怀，护士人数已在不断的增加，各地护校也有了空前的发展，但我们要求它发展得更快、更好。对护士的质量和数量，希望领导根据12年卫生规划的需要提出要求，作为我们努力的方向。在党和政府强有力的领导下，我们有信心完成党和上级交给我们的任务。我有决心在护士工作岗位上用实际行动来迎接文化卫生高潮的来到！
