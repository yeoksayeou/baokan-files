Widely Disseminating Agricultural Bumper Harvest Experience

    Nearly 300 agricultural labor models and farmer technicians from Xincheng County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have personally introduced their bumper harvest experiences with corn, rice, and peanuts to Zhuang farmers throughout the county, powerfully promoting spring plowing and production.

    In 29 reporting stations, they gave dozens of lectures, broadcasts, and seminars to the masses in 105 townships across the county. After listening to the report on Pan Yecheng's spring corn bumper harvest experience, members of the Changliu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Masizhuang Township revised their production plan. They decided that all the cooperative's corn would be planted using single-plant close planting, increasing the annual yield from the original 400 jin to 700 jin. After hearing the "How to Grow Double-Cropping Rice" report by a technician from the Linghao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gufang Township, the farmers of Xijiang Township mobilized thousands of people the next day to dig tens of thousands of dan of pond mud, and also expanded the area for planting double-cropping rice from 1,000 mu to 3,000 mu.

    Currently, the entire county's more than 200,000 mu of spring corn is about to be sown. Based on the specific situation, the Xincheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has increased the original grain production increase target for the entire county by approximately one time.

    广泛传播农业丰产经验
    广西省桂西僮族自治区忻城县近300名农业劳动模范和农民技术员，把自己的玉米、水稻和花生的丰产经验，亲自介绍给全县僮族农民，有力地推动了春耕生产。
    他们在29个报告站里，向全县105个乡的群众作了几十次讲演、广播和座谈。马泗乡长流农业生产合作社社员们听了潘也成春玉米丰产经验报告以后，修改了生产计划。决定社里的玉米全部实行单株密植，年产量由原定400斤提高到700斤。西江乡农民听了古房乡凌好农业生产合作社技术员的“怎样种植双季稻”报告，第二天全乡就出动几千人挖了几万担塘泥，还把播种双季稻的面积从1，000亩扩大到3，000亩。
    目前，全县20多万亩春玉米就要播种完毕。中共忻城县委员会根据具体情况，已经把原定全县粮食增产指标提高了大约一倍。（据新华社讯）
