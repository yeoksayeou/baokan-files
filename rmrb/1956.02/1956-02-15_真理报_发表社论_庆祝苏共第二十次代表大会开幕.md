Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 14th: TASS reports that "Pravda," "Izvestia," "Red Star," and "Trud" all published editorials on February 14th celebrating the opening of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

	The "Pravda" editorial stated that the Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded by the great Lenin, is a major event in the life of the Party and the Soviet people. This Congress is a particularly important milestone on the Soviet society's path towards communism.

	"Pravda" continued, saying that Communists and the entire Soviet people warmly agree with and actively support the Leninist foreign policy implemented under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Consistent adherence to this policy has further strengthened the great socialist camp and consolidated world peace. The forces of peace, with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all People's Democratic countries as their strongholds, have greatly grown and achieved tremendous success in the past few years. Lenin's policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems has led to a certain degree of detente in international relations.

	Speaking about economic construction, "Pravda" pointed out that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has consistently implemented Lenin's plan to turn the Soviet Union into a powerful socialist country. In an unprecedentedly short period of time, the Soviet Union has transformed from an economically backward country into a great country with increasingly prosperous socialist industry and the world's largest socialist agriculture. The Soviet people look with patriotic pride at one of the most important programs in the draft directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, which emphasizes that the Soviet Union now possesses all the necessary conditions to reach its fundamental economic goal in the shortest historical period on the path of peaceful economic competition: to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output. The Sixth Five-Year Plan period will be a decisive stage in solving this enormous task. The realization of this great plan will once again powerfully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of socialism over the capitalist system in the Soviet Union. This will be a new victory in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism, a victory for the increasingly powerful international socialist camp, and a new victory for the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.

	"Pravda" said that the Soviet people are deeply convinced that the comprehensive tasks facing our country at the current stage of its development will be victoriously completed.

	"Pravda" concluded by writing that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union welcomes the 20th Party Congress with vigorous strength and exuberant creativity. The Party is loved by tens of millions of Soviet people, the working people of the People's Democratic countries, and all progressive humanity. Its unwavering internationalist policy and tireless struggle to strengthen friendship between all peoples are warmly supported by all who advocate peace, democracy, and socialism. Fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties regard the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as an inspiring example in the struggle for communism, the happiness of the people, and world peace.

    “真理报”发表社论
    庆祝苏共第二十次代表大会开幕
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”、“消息报”、“红星报”和“劳动报”都在2月14日发表社论，庆祝苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的开幕。
    “真理报”的社论说，伟大的列宁所缔造的苏联共产党的代表大会，是党和苏联人民生活中的一个重大事件。这次代表大会是在苏维埃社会向共产主义前进途中的一个特别重要的里程碑。
    “真理报”接着说，共产党员和全体苏联人民一样热烈赞同并且积极支持在苏联共产党中央委员会领导下执行的列宁的外交政策。一贯遵循这种政策已经进一步加强了伟大的社会主义阵营并且巩固了世界和平。以苏联、中华人民共和国和所有人民民主国家为其强大堡垒的和平力量，在过去几年中已经大大地增长并且取得了巨大的成就。列宁倡导的具有不同社会制度的国家之间和平共处的政策，已经使国际关系得到某种和解。
    “真理报”在谈到经济建设的问题时指出，苏联共产党一贯执行列宁的把苏联变成一个强大的社会主义国家的计划。在空前短的时间内，苏联已经从一个经济落后的国家变成一个具有日益兴盛的社会主义工业和世界上最大的社会主义农业的伟大国家。苏联人民抱着一种热爱祖国的自豪感，来看待第六个五年计划指示草案里的最重要的纲领之一，这项纲领强调现在苏联拥有一切必要条件，在和平经济竞赛的道路上，在最短的历史时期内，达到它的基本的经济目标：在按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上并且超过最发达的资本主义国家。而第六个五年计划时期将是解决这项巨大任务的决定性阶段。实现这个伟大的计划将再次有力地表明在苏联已经取得胜利的社会主义比资本主义制度有无比的优越性。这将是社会主义同资本主义进行和平经济竞赛中的一个新的胜利，是日益强大的国际社会主义阵营的一个胜利，是苏联和平外交政策的一个新胜利。
    “真理报”说，苏联人民深信，我们国家在它的发展的现阶段中所面临的全面任务，都将胜利完成。
    “真理报”最后写道，苏联共产党以蓬勃的力量和旺盛的创造力来迎接第二十次党代表大会。党受到千千万万的苏联人民以及人民民主国家的劳动人民和全体进步人类的敬爱。它的始终不渝的国际主义政策和不倦地争取加强各国人民之间的友谊的斗争，受到所有主张和平、民主和社会主义的人的热烈支持。兄弟的共产党和工人党认为，苏联共产党是为共产主义、人民的幸福和世界和平而奋斗的令人鼓舞的榜样。
