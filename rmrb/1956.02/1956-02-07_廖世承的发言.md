Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades:

I fully endorse Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the reports of all the leading comrades. I am an old intellectual who has been influenced by bourgeois ideology and feudal remnants. I have never left school in my life, and I have been engaged in school administration and teaching for nearly 37 years. I initially taught at Nanjing Higher Normal School and National Southeastern University, while also managing the affiliated middle school. Later, I served as the vice president of Shanghai Private Guanghua University, while also managing the affiliated middle school. During the Anti-Japanese War, I founded Lantian Teachers College in Hunan. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I left Hunan and returned to Shanghai. Some friends advised me at the time: "You should not abandon the career you have painstakingly built up over the years." I replied: "I have never regarded the school as my personal territory or personal career. I am a pioneer in the field of education and have never stayed in a school for a long time. If my energy permits, perhaps I can cultivate another piece of land in my life."

After returning to Shanghai, I continued to serve at Guanghua. In 1951, Guanghua and Daxia merged to form East China Normal University, and I served as the Second Vice President. During the first semester, when Presidents Meng and Sun had not yet arrived at the school, I was solely responsible for school affairs. In the spring of 1952, Vice President Sun arrived at the school, and he and Party Secretary Zhou Kang presided over the "Three-Anti" and ideological remolding work within the school. Vice President Sun and I had offices in the same room, with two small rooms at either end for briefings. During the briefings, both doors were closed, and I sat alone in the office, feeling bewildered for two or three months. My first report at the general assembly was not approved. Someone pointed out to me: "The affiliated middle school of Southeastern University is also a banner in the education field, and this banner must be torn down." Therefore, when I made my second report at the general assembly, I deeply criticized my work during my time at the affiliated middle school of Southeastern University. I couldn't help but burst into tears during the criticism, because some friends had told me before: "Your time at the affiliated middle school of Southeastern University is the most glorious page in your history of education." Now, the glorious page had become an ugly side, which pained my heart. At that time, I couldn't deeply understand that unless bourgeois idealist ideas were criticized, the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint could not be established.

After the second report at the general assembly was approved, the Party Secretary told me: "We can unite more closely together in the future." Once, during a collective office meeting discussing the investigation of the teaching performance of a certain department, the Party Secretary proposed twice that I preside over the investigation, but the chairman did not speak, and finally, the Party Secretary withdrew his suggestion voluntarily. At that time, I had just criticized the old ideas, and I hadn't yet been able to grasp the new ones. I already had some feelings of inferiority, and this further shook my confidence in myself. At that time, President Meng had already arrived at the school, and the three presidents did not have a clear division of labor. Generally, President Meng took overall charge, Vice President Sun presided over all important teaching work, and I was mostly responsible for general affairs, finance, construction, sports, and health work. Although there were no major mistakes in my work over the years, there were also no significant achievements. I always felt that my enthusiasm for work was not enough, and I had not been able to fully utilize my old experience to contribute to the new socialist cause, so I often felt depressed.

In order to get rid of my depression, I often thought about how to unleash my potential. The first answer I got was that my level of Marxism-Leninism was too low. As long as I seriously studied political theory, I could improve myself. Therefore, I was very serious about systematically studying political theory. I attended every report and took detailed notes every time. Of course, my theoretical level would not improve much in a short year or two. But after a year or two of study, I learned some theories and understood some theories. However, these theories did not help me much when it came to specific problems. Therefore, I thought again: to improve myself, I must do a good job in my profession. As long as I can improve work efficiency, other problems will be solved easily. But how to improve work efficiency, I still had no idea, and this one-sided and unrealistic pursuit of work efficiency did not truly unleash my enthusiasm and creativity. Therefore, I thought again: more observation and more participation in social activities would definitely help me, because intellectuals are sensitive to new things. Every time I participated in social activities, it did enlighten me, but after a while, I was still the same. My enthusiasm for work was always far behind that of the workers and peasants.

But there have been many examples in the past six years that have indeed enlightened me. Let me give a few examples: One was: in the summer of 1954, a food poisoning incident occurred at East China Normal University, and at that time, three or four hundred students were ill. At that time, Chang Xiping, the Third Vice President and Party Secretary, had not been at the school for long. He organized forces day and night to take care of the patients. But I, as the director of the Health Committee, did not do much. I excused myself, saying that I was old and could not stay up all night. But Vice President Chang, although not yet forty years old, had suffered damage to his health during the revolutionary period, and his physique was not strong. His concern for the masses, his love for the masses, and his selfless spirit of labor deeply moved me. Another thing was that the Soviet expert, Deplitskaya, was a female comrade. At East China Normal University, she taught classes, led research classes, and served as a consultant to the president. At the same time, she assisted the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau in guiding the principals of various middle schools and also conducted experiments at the affiliated middle school of the normal university. Her daily work was full. Sometimes she had a stomach ache, but she still worked regardless of everything. Her persevering, selfless labor spirit and internationalism greatly enlightened me. Another earth-shattering event was: in recent months, I have seen the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement all over the country, and I have also seen the high tide of socialist transformation in the cities. As an intellectual, I am both excited and ashamed. In these and other practical examples, and in the education and enlightenment that the Party has given me over the years since liberation, I have gradually seen the root cause of my illness. What is this root cause? It is the "I" cultivated by bourgeois ideological education and feudal remnants that is causing trouble. In the old society, I thought I could be loyal and responsible for education, but who was I responsible for? Was I serving the broad masses of working people? No. I was serving the ruling class and serving my own reputation and status. In the past, I thought I did not regard the school as my personal territory or personal career, but in fact my pursuit of fame and gain was even stronger than those who regarded the school as their personal territory and personal career. The more I thought I was superior to others, the more I showed my arrogance. Because of my arrogance, I felt a sting to my self-esteem during ideological remolding and shed tears. Because of my arrogance, I lost my reliance and became an inferiority complex. All of this is because the deep-rooted "I" is constantly lingering in my mind. I thought I had more than 30 years of experience in running schools, but in fact, these experiences were just bits and pieces. What was there to be proud of? I am so insignificant in the great revolutionary torrent. What is there to praise?

We know that the peasants' burden is private land, and the national industrialists and businessmen's burden is private capital. As long as they get rid of these burdens, they can wholeheartedly devote themselves to socialist construction. But what about me? As an intellectual, my burden is deeply hidden in my mind and cannot be easily discarded. It is like Sun Wukong's golden hoop. No matter how great your magical powers are, as long as the incantation is recited, you can be forced to submit. It can make you suddenly complacent, suddenly hesitant and passive, suddenly excited, and suddenly depressed. I am trapped by my own cocoon, and there are many problems. Because it occupies the main position in my mind, the Marxist-Leninist theories that I have learned cannot play their due role, my enthusiasm for work is limited, and visits, practice, and other social activities cannot help me much. Chairman Mao taught us: "The purpose of the socialist revolution is to liberate the productive forces." I can boldly say that the most basic thing in my personal socialist transformation is to constantly fight against the "I" in thought, study, work, lifestyle, and dealing with people, constantly reflect on myself, compress the "I's" ideological position to a secondary position, so that the Marxist-Leninist ideological position can occupy a dominant position, and gradually establish a communist worldview and outlook on life, and liberate my power from the short-sighted "I" and the narrow-minded "I". This is a long and arduous struggle. Only in this way can my political theory level and professional level improve day by day, will my work be active, will unity be strengthened, and will I be able to participate wholeheartedly in the construction of socialism.

I dare not say that I have already begun to transform. I can only say that I have just touched the root cause of my illness and have a direction for self-transformation. I must resolutely fight against it and guarantee the realization of the following goals:

(1) Closely rely on the Party and unconditionally accept all the leadership of the Party.

(2) Continue to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, constantly criticize bourgeois idealist ideas, and gradually establish a communist worldview and outlook on life.

(3) Further study my profession, critically apply my old experience, unleash my potential, and complete the glorious and arduous tasks assigned to us cultural and educational workers by the motherland more quickly and better, and march towards science together with intellectuals across the country.

(4) As a member of the China Democratic League, strengthen unity, connect with the masses, and do a good job in the League's grassroots work under the leadership of the Party. That is to say, I want to do my part to do a good job in helping each other, improving each other, and having the advanced lead the backward.

I firmly believe that in this great Mao Zedong era, it is a great honor in life to liberate all personal strength and serve the noble and great construction cause of the motherland. Although I am old, before my heart stops beating, I must strive forward for socialist construction.

    廖世承的发言
    主席、诸位委员、诸位同志：
    我完全拥护周恩来主席的政治报告和各位首长的报告。我是一个旧知识分子，一方面受了资产阶级思想教育的影响，另一方面也受了封建残余思想教育的影响。我一生没有离开过学校，担任学校行政和教学工作快37年了。我初在南高东大教书，兼办附属中学；后又担任上海私立光华大学副校长，兼办附属中学；抗日战争时期又在湖南创办蓝田师范学院。抗战胜利后，我离开湖南，回到上海。当时有的朋友劝我说：“你不应放弃多年来惨淡经营的事业。”我回答说：“我一向不把学校当作个人的地盘，个人的事业。我是教育园地上一个垦荒者，从没有在一所学校内留得很长久的。倘使精力容许我的话，或许我今生再能开垦一片园地。”
    我回到上海后，仍在光华服务。1951年光华、大夏合并成立华东师范大学，我担任第二副校长。第一学期，孟、孙两校长未到校，校务由我一人负责。1952年春孙副校长到校，他和党委书记周康同志主持校内“三反”及思想改造工作。我和孙副校长本在同一办公室，办公室的两头有两间小房，各方汇报即在小房内听取。汇报进行时，两头的门都关上，我孤零零的一个人枯坐在办公室内，如是者有两三个月之久，甚感仿徨。我第一次在大会报告，没有通过。有人指点我说：“东大附中在教育界也是一面旗帜，这面旗帜一定要扯下来。”因此，我第二次在大会作报告时，对在东大附中这一阶段的工作，深深地批判了。批判时不觉声泪俱下，因为以前有的朋友曾同我说：“你在东大附中这一时期，是你办教育的历史中最光荣的一页”，现在光荣的一页，变成丑恶的一面，刺痛了我的心。自己当时还不能深切体会到，资产阶级唯心主义思想不批判掉，马列主义的观点就无法建立起来。
    第二次在大会的报告通过后，党委书记告诉我：“我们今后可更亲密的团结在一起。”有一次集体办公在讨论调查某系教学成绩时，党委书记两次提议由我主持调查工作，但主席没有作声，最后党委书记自动的撤回他的建议。我在那时旧的刚批判掉，新的还没有能掌握，自己已有些自卑感，再加上这么一来，自己对自己的信心更动摇了。那时孟校长已来校，三位校长也没有明确分工。大体上，孟校长总其成，孙副校长主持一切重要的教学工作，我对于总务、财务、基建、体育卫生工作多负些责任。数年来，工作上虽没有什么大错误，但也没有显著成绩。自己总觉得劳动积极性不够，没有能充分利用旧经验，对新社会事业有所贡献，因而时感苦闷。
    为了摆脱苦闷，自己经常在想：怎样才能发挥自己的力量。首先得到的答案是我的马列主义的水平太低。只要认真学习政治理论，就能提高自己。因此，我对于系统的政治理论学习很认真，听报告每次都到，而且每次都做有详尽的笔记。当然在短短的一两年内理论水平是不会怎样提高的。但是经过一两年的学习，多少总学到了一些理论，懂得了一些理论。可是这一些理论，一到具体问题上，就对我没有什么帮助。因此，我又想：要提高自己，必须把业务搞好。只要能提高工作效能，其他问题就迎刃而解了。但怎样提高工作效能，依然心中无数，并且这种片面的空想的追求工作效能，并没有真正能发挥自己的积极性和创造性。因此，我又想：多观察，多参加社会活动，一定对我有帮助，因为知识分子对于新事物是敏感的。每次参加社会活动确实对我有启发，但事过境迁，依然故我，自己的劳动积极性总是远远的落在工农分子后面。
    但六年来有不少事例确实启发了我。举几个例子：一件是：1954年夏季华东师大发生了食物中毒事故，当时患病学生有三四百人。那时第三副校长兼党委书记常溪萍同志到校不久，他夜以继日的组织力量，照顾病人。而我身为保健委员会主任委员，反没有尽多大力量。我自己宽恕自己，年龄大了，熬不得夜。可是常副校长虽然年龄不到四十，他在革命时期，身体受到亏损，体格也并不壮健。他的关心群众，爱护群众，忘我的劳动精神深深地感动了我。另一件事是：苏联专家杰普莉茨卡娅是一位女同志，她在华东师大一方面担任教课，领导研究班，另一方面担任校长顾问；同时又协助上海市教育局指导各中学校长，又在师大附中进行实验。她每天的工作都是排得满满的。有时她胃病发了，仍不顾一切的工作着。她的经久不懈的忘我劳动精神和国际主义精神大大的启发了我。另一件惊天动地的大事就是：最近数月来看到了全国各地农业合作化运动的高潮，又看到了都市中社会主义改造的高潮，我，作为一个知识分子，又是兴奋，又是惭愧。在这些以及其他的实际事例中，在解放数年来党给我的教育与启发中，我渐渐地看到了自己的受病根源。这根源是什么？就是资产阶级思想教育和封建残余思想教育所孕育着的“我”在作怪。在旧社会中，我自以为对教育事业能忠诚负责，试问为谁负责？为广大劳动人民服务吗？不是的。是为统治阶级服务，为自己的名誉地位服务。过去，我自以为不把学校当作个人的地盘，个人的事业，实则我的名利观念比把学校当作个人地盘，个人事业的人还要浓重。自以为超人一等，就愈表示自己的自高自大。因为自高自大，所以在思想改造时，刺痛了自尊心，会掉眼泪。因为自高自大，所以失去了凭依，就变成了自卑感。这都是根深蒂固的“我”在脑中缠绕不休。自以为有30多年的办学经验，实则这些经验都是点点滴滴，有什么值得骄傲？自己在伟大的革命洪流中是这样的渺小，有什么值得称许？
    我们知道农民的包袱是私有的土地，民族工商业者的包袱是私人资本，他们只要把包袱丢了，就能诚心诚意的投入社会主义建设。而我呢，作为一个知识分子，包袱是深藏在脑中，不是轻易丢得掉的。它像孙悟空的紧箍帽一样，凭你有多大神通，只要念动紧箍咒，就可使你俯首就范。它可以使你忽尔沾沾自喜，忽尔仿徨消极，忽尔兴奋，忽尔苦闷。作茧自缚，问题重重。由于它盘踞了我脑中的主要阵地，所以我学到的一些马克思列宁主义理论就不能发挥它应有的作用，工作的积极性就受到了局限，参观、实践以及其他社会活动就不能对我有很大的帮助。毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义革命的目的是为了解放生产力。”我可以大胆的说，我个人的社会主义改造最基本的是要在思想上、学习上、工作上、生活方式上、待人接物上，不断地与“我”作斗争，不断地反省自身，把“我”的思想阵地压缩到次要地位，使马克思列宁主义的思想阵地能够占优势地位，逐渐地建立起共产主义世界观和人生观，把我的力量从鼠目寸光的“我”，范围狭隘的“我”中解放出来。这是一个长期的艰苦的斗争。只有这样，自己的政治理论水平和业务水平才会一天一天的提高，工作才会积极，团结才会加强，对社会主义的建设才能全心全意的参加。
    我不敢说我现在已经开始有了转变，我只能说现在刚刚摸到了自己的受病根源，有了自我改造的斗争方向。我要坚决向它作斗争，并保证实现下列奋斗目标：
    （一）紧密地靠拢党，无条件地接受党的一切领导。
    （二）继续加强学习马克思列宁主义，学习苏联先进经验，不断地批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，逐步地树立共产主义世界观和人生观。
    （三）进一步钻研业务，批判地运用旧经验，发挥潜在力量，更快更好地完成祖国交给我们文教工作者光荣而艰巨的任务，并与全国知识分子一道，向科学进军。
    （四）作为一个民盟成员，加强团结，联系群众，在党的领导下，做好盟的基层工作。这也就是，我要尽我的一分力量，做好互相帮助，互相提高，先进带动落后的工作。
    我坚决相信，在这伟大的毛泽东时代，能把个人的一切力量解放出来，为祖国崇高而伟大的建设事业服务，是一生莫大的光荣。我虽年迈，在我的心脏没有停止跳动以前，我一定要为社会主义建设而奋斗前进。
