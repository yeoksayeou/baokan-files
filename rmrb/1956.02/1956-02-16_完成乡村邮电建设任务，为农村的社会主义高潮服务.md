Complete Rural Postal and Telecommunications Construction Tasks to Serve the Socialist Upsurge in the Countryside
Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Wang Zigang

    According to Chairman Mao's instructions and the principle of "overall planning and strengthened leadership," the National Rural Postal and Telecommunications Work Conference put forward a preliminary plan for rural postal and telecommunications construction. The recently announced "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956-1967" further clarifies the task of rural postal and telecommunications construction, requiring that "starting in 1956, according to local conditions, telephone networks should be completed for townships and large cooperatives within 7 or 12 years. Where necessary, radio telephones should be installed. Within 7 years, the rural postal network should be popularized, and postal delivery and newspaper distribution should be improved." Rural postal and telecommunications construction is of great significance to agricultural development and promoting the socialist upsurge in the countryside. Based on the rapid development of agricultural cooperation and possible conditions, we should complete the telephone networks for townships and large agricultural cooperatives within the next 7 years, establish postal and telecommunications service institutions in rural market towns and necessary townships, extend postal routes to all townships, ensure that newspapers and periodicals are widely subscribed to by agricultural cooperatives, and distribute newspapers and periodicals to production teams and groups. Agricultural cooperatives should universally implement a postal delivery system, with various mail items and newspapers delivered to households by cooperative postmen. This scale and speed of construction are unprecedented in our country's history. To conscientiously and responsibly ensure the completion of the task on schedule or ahead of schedule, and to manage them well, is the glorious task of all our postal and telecommunications workers in rural socialist construction.

    To accomplish this task, the first step is to do a good job of planning. The county postal and telecommunications bureau is the basic unit for rural postal and telecommunications construction, and each county postal and telecommunications bureau must make a plan for the construction of rural postal and telecommunications in the entire county, which is an important link in ensuring the realization of the plan. The plan must implement the principles of economy, applicability, and consideration of future development, as well as fully utilizing the enthusiasm of local areas and the masses. It must be based on local needs and the possibilities of manpower, materials, financial resources, and other conditions, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies, and proposing appropriate construction plans and progress requirements. Due to the large scale of rural postal and telecommunications construction, we must fully estimate all aspects of the conditions. We must resolutely overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and ensure that things that can be done with effort are done; at the same time, we must prevent blind planning that disregards objective conditions and reluctantly doing things that cannot be done. We know that the socialist upsurge in the countryside is rapidly changing the face of the countryside, administrative divisions will be more rationally adjusted, local transportation is developing, agricultural water conservancy construction is underway, and agricultural production will greatly develop. These changes are closely related to the layout of the rural postal and telecommunications network. For example, the selection of service institutions and telephone exchange locations, the routes of lines and postal routes, and construction specifications need to be adapted to the changes and development of rural conditions. Failure to grasp these situations will easily make the planning unrealistic, causing rework and waste in construction. Rural telephone construction must also be planned according to the minimum required standard specifications. For example, the height of wooden poles and the thickness of wires for rural telephone lines must be based on the principle of sharing poles and lines with wired broadcasting, and appropriate standards must be proposed based on terrain, load, and other conditions. It must be able to both communicate and broadcast, ensure the safety of machines, lines, and personnel, and be economical and conserve resources. Standards should not be raised or inappropriately lowered, as this will not guarantee communication and broadcasting quality and will make them unusable after completion; raising standards will increase investment and affect construction speed. Both of these potential biases should be prevented. The planning for the establishment of postal institutions should calculate the service population, area, and volume of business to ensure reasonable distribution. The most needed areas should be addressed first, and great attention should be paid to saving personnel. When planning, the potential that postal and telecommunications enterprises may tap must be calculated, and people should be drawn from existing personnel to set up some service institutions. The maintenance and management of existing equipment must be considered when planning and included in the overall plan. Only considering new construction without considering the maintenance and management of existing equipment may result in the newly built being completed while the original equipment is dilapidated, causing losses to the state.

    Secondly, it is necessary to ensure the high-quality completion of new construction tasks, so as to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. For rural telephone construction, necessary exploration and design should be carried out to build rural telephone networks in the shortest, least transited, and most economical way. Manpower should be properly organized. A group of personnel with certain technical capabilities should be drawn from existing personnel, and some newly recruited personnel should be trained using accelerated methods to form the basic team for telephone construction in the entire province, and construction should be carried out by region and county. The work of transporting materials and digging pits can mobilize the necessary local labor for construction. In construction, it is necessary to ensure timely supply of materials, rational transportation, and avoid the disconnection of material supply and reverse transportation. The key to ensuring construction quality lies in strict technical requirements, operating in accordance with technical procedures, strengthening technical management, and establishing an engineering inspection and acceptance system. Rural telephone construction specifies the minimum standards, and if the construction quality is not good, it will not guarantee communication and broadcasting. Due to the fast speed and large scale of telephone construction, quality problems are easily overlooked; postal and telecommunications cadres at all levels must fully attach importance to this point, establish necessary systems, conduct extensive and in-depth education for employees, ensure that poles are firmly planted, wires are tightly tied, insulation is good, eliminate the impact of natural conditions, etc., and prevent and correct perfunctory and rough phenomena. For rural postal construction, on the one hand, the establishment of service institutions and postal routes should be economical and reasonable, so as to serve more people, prevent indiscriminate establishment regardless of priorities, and prevent duplication of postal routes and reverse flow of mail; on the other hand, when setting up institutions, postal routes, and implementing the cooperative postal delivery system, it is also necessary to prevent excessive demands, such as purchasing too much furniture, raising the standards of various utensils, or excessively demanding the quality and treatment of cooperative postmen. The establishment of rural postal institutions and telephone exchanges should be combined as much as possible, so that reasonable part-time jobs can be implemented in terms of personnel use, and telephone and postal personnel can assist each other in their work to save manpower.

    Finally, how to strengthen the management of such postal and telecommunications work all over the country and give full play to their role is a problem that our postal and telecommunications departments should pay great attention to and be responsible for. The county postal and telecommunications bureau is the basic management unit of rural postal and telecommunications, and it must strengthen management, improve operations, and ensure communication and service quality. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration must also assume full leadership responsibilities, establish and improve rural postal and telecommunications management institutions, and ensure that rural postal and telecommunications work is well managed from top to bottom. In order to strengthen the management of rural postal and telecommunications, postal and telecommunications bureaus at all levels must, on the one hand, strengthen and improve the relevant institutions, increase the necessary cadres under the principle of economy, and clarify their responsibilities, while at the same time enabling the county postal and telecommunications bureaus and branches set up in rural areas to undertake the management tasks of rural postal and telecommunications in their respective regions. On the other hand, there must be a certain management system and ensure that it is implemented. Postal and telecommunications authorities at all levels must put the construction and management of rural postal and telecommunications on the regular agenda, discuss them regularly, clarify the division of labor, improve their work style, go deep into the grassroots, strengthen supervision and inspection, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, summarize and exchange experiences, and commend and reward good units and individuals, so as to continuously improve the management level of rural postal and telecommunications. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the business and technical education of employees in a planned way, improve the business and technical level of employees, so as to continuously improve and improve communication and service quality. Rural telephones should gradually implement enterprise-oriented operations, strive to be self-sufficient, and ensure the expenditure of maintenance and management costs. Rural telephones and broadcasting adopt the method of sharing poles and lines, and necessary systems should be stipulated to open broadcasting regularly. Each postal and telecommunications bureau must manage the lines outside the broadcasting station with a positive and responsible attitude, and guide users to maintain the equipment they use.

    Postal and telecommunications bureaus at all levels should report the situation, difficulties, problems, and measures and methods to be taken in the construction and management of rural postal and telecommunications to the local party committees and governments in a timely and regular manner to obtain instructions and assistance. This is the guarantee for the successful completion of the task. Problems related to the broad masses of the people must be publicized and explained, and explained clearly to the masses in order to gain the support and supervision of the masses.

    完成乡村邮电建设任务，为农村的社会主义高潮服务
    邮电部副部长　王子纲
    根据毛主席的指示和“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，全国乡村邮电工作会议提出了乡村邮电建设的初步规划。在最近公布的“1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要”（草案）里更明确提出了乡村邮电建设任务，要求“从1956年开始，按照各地情况，分别在7年或者12年内，完成乡和大型合作社的电话网。在必要的地方，设置无线报话器。在7年内普及农村邮政网，做好邮电传递和报刊发行工作。”乡村邮电建设对农业的发展和推动乡村的社会主义高潮具有重要意义。根据农业合作化的迅速发展和可能条件，我们应该在今后7年内完成乡和大型农业社的电话网，在农村的集镇和必要的乡都设立邮电服务机构，邮路普遍到乡，农业社普遍订报刊，并向生产队、组发行报刊，农业合作社普遍实行邮递员制度，各种邮件报刊经过合作社邮递员投递到户。这个建设规模和速度，在我国历史上是空前的。认真负责地保证任务的如期完成和提前完成，并把它们管理好，是我们全体邮电职工在农村社会主义建设中的光荣任务。
    为了完成这个任务，首先必须做好规划。县邮电局是乡村邮电建设的基本单位，每个县邮电局做好全县乡村邮电建设的规划是保证计划实现的重要一环。规划中必须贯彻经济、适用并照顾将来发展的方针和充分发挥地方和群众积极性的原则，要根据当地的需要和人力、物力、财力的可能，以及其他条件，分别轻重缓急，提出适当的建设规划和进度要求。由于乡村邮电建设的规模大，必须充分估计到各方面的条件。既要坚决克服右倾保守思想，把经过努力可以做到的事情，一定做到；同时也必须防止不顾客观条件的盲目规划，勉强地去做那些办不到的事情。我们知道，农村的社会主义高潮，在迅速改变着农村的面貌，行政区划将更合理地加以调整，地方交通在发展，农业水利建设在进行，农业生产将大大发展，这些情况的变化都密切关系着乡村邮电通信网的布局。如服务机构和电话交换所地点的选择，线路和邮路的路由，建设规格等，都需要同农村情况的变化和发展相适应。不掌握这些情况，就容易使规划不切实际，造成建设中的返工浪费。乡村电话建设还必须按照最低应该有的标准规格进行规划。如乡村电话线路的木杆高度、线条粗细，都要根据同有线广播同杆同线的原则，根据地形、负荷等情况，提出适当的标准。既要作到能够通话和广播，又要保证机线和人员的安全，还要作到经济节约。不要标准或不适当地降低标准，将不能保证通信和广播质量，建成后也不能使用；提高标准，就会增加投资和影响建设速度。这两种可能产生的偏向都应防止。邮政机构的设置规划，要计算服务人口、面积和业务量的多少，做到分布合理。首先解决最需要的地方，并且要十分注意节省人员。在规划时就要计算邮电企业可能挖掘的潜力，从现有人员中抽出人来，设置一些服务机构。对原有设备的维修和管理，必须在规划时加以考虑，并列在全面规划之中。只考虑新建，不考虑原有设备的维修管理，就可能形成新建的建成后，原有的已破烂不堪，给国家造成损失。
    其次，必须保证质量良好地完成新建任务，作到既要多，要快，又要好，要省。乡村电话的建设，要进行必要的勘查设计，使电话线路最短，转接最少，最经济地建成乡村电话网。要妥善地组织人力，从现有人员中抽出一批有一定技术能力的人员，再用速成办法训练一些招考来的人员，组成全省电话建设的基本队伍，分区、分县地进行建设。运料、挖坑等工作可以就地动员必要的民工建勤。建设中要作到及时供应材料，合理运输，避免材料供应的脱节和倒运现象。保证建设质量的关键在于严格的技术要求，按照技术规程操作，加强技术管理，建立工程检查和验收制度。乡村电话建设规定的是最低的标准，如果建设质量不好，将不能保证通话和广播。由于电话建设的速度快，规模大，质量问题是很容易被忽略的；各级邮电干部必须充分重视这一点，建立必要的制度，对职工进行广泛深入的教育，保证杆子栽牢，线扎紧，绝缘要良好，排除自然条件的影响等，防止和纠正草率、粗糙现象。乡村邮政的建设，一方面要使服务机构和邮路的设置经济合理，能为更多的群众服务，防止不分轻重缓急，随便设置，防止邮路的重复和邮件倒流现象；另一方面在设置机构、邮路和实行合作社邮递员制度的时候，也要防止要求过高，如过多的购置家具，提高各种用具标准，或过高要求合作社邮递员的质量和待遇等。乡村邮政机构和电话交换所的设置应该尽可能地结合起来，这样就可以在人员使用方面实行合理兼职，电话和邮政人员互相协助工作，以节省人力。
    最后，对这样遍布全国乡村的邮电通信工作，如何加强管理，充分发挥它们的作用，是我们邮电部门应该十分重视和负责的问题。县邮电局是乡村邮电的基本管理单位，必须加强管理，改进经营，保证通信和服务质量。邮电部和省邮电管理局也要负起全面的领导责任，建立和健全乡村邮电管理机构，自上而下地保证把乡村邮电工作管好。各级邮电局为了加强乡村邮电的管理，一方面要加强和健全有关的机构，在节约原则下增加必要的干部，并明确他们的职责，同时使县邮电局和设在乡村的分支局，担当起各该地区的乡村邮电的管理任务。另一方面必须有一定的管理制度，并保证贯彻下去。各级邮电机关必须把乡村邮电的建设和管理，提到经常的议事日程上来，定期讨论，明确分工，改进工作作风，深入下层，加强督促和检查，及时发现问题解决问题，总结交流经验，表扬和奖励好的单位和个人，以便不断提高乡村邮电的管理水平。同时还必须有计划地加强职工的业务技术教育，提高职工的业务技术水平，以不断提高和改善通信和服务质量。乡村电话应该逐步实行企业化的经营，争取做到自给自足，保证维护和管理费用的开支。乡村电话和广播采用同杆同线的办法，应规定必要的制度，定时开放广播。各邮电局必须以积极负责的态度，管好广播站以外的线路，指导用户维护自己使用的设备。
    各级邮电局要把乡村邮电建设和管理工作的情况、困难、问题和应采取的措施、办法等，及时地经常地向当地党委和政府作报告，取得指示和帮助。这是顺利完成任务的保证。同广大群众有关的问题，必须进行宣传和解释，向群众交代清楚，以取得群众的支持和监督。
