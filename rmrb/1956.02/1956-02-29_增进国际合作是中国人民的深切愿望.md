Promoting international cooperation and strengthening friendly exchanges and economic and cultural exchanges between our country and the people of all countries are the deep desires and goals of the Chinese government and people. In recent years, while stepping up socialist construction, the Chinese people have also been committed to enhancing friendly relations with the people of all countries in the world. The two diagrams above illustrate the tremendous development of China's foreign relations in 1955. In this year, a total of 4,760 foreign people came to China to visit, lecture, study, perform, compete, hold exhibitions, and participate in other activities. This number is 64% higher than in 1954. They came from 63 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Australia, representing different political and religious beliefs and having different professions. At the same time, a total of 5,833 people from all walks of life in our country (including duplicate figures for a few representatives or delegations who visited more than two countries) also visited 33 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas for friendly visits and other economic and cultural exchange activities. This number is two-thirds higher than in 1954.

The extensive contact and friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the people of all countries have played a significant role in strengthening international cooperation and enhancing mutual understanding and trust. Facts have proved that this kind of friendly exchange and cultural exchange is one of the important factors in promoting international cooperation and safeguarding world peace.

However, it should also be stated that, as can be seen from the first diagram, the exchanges between the Chinese people and some capitalist countries, especially the people of the Americas, are still very few. In the past year, only a few people from our country have visited countries in the Americas, and not many people from the Americas have been able to come to our country for visits. This abnormal situation is inseparable from the restrictions and obstacles imposed by the US authorities on friendly exchanges between people of all countries. In order to realize the wishes of the people of all countries and the interests of international cooperation, this artificial obstacle must be eliminated.

In 1955, the Chinese people made active efforts to expand foreign relations and achieved great success. We hope to further develop friendly exchanges with the people of all countries in the future, strengthen economic and cultural exchanges with all countries, and unite with the people of all countries to strive for the cause of safeguarding world peace.

    增进国际合作是中国人民的深切愿望
    增进国际合作，加强我国同各国人民之间的友好往来和经济、文化交流，是我国政府和人民的深切愿望和努力目标。近年来，在加紧建设社会主义的同时，我国人民也致力于增进同世界各国人民的友好关系。上面的这两幅图解，说明了1955年我国对外联系巨大发展的情形。在这一年内，总共有4，760名外国人士来到我国进行参观、访问、讲学、学习、表演、比赛、举办展览会以及其他各种活动。这个数目比1954年增加了64％。他们来自亚洲、欧洲、非洲、美洲和澳洲的63个国家，代表着不同的政治和宗教信仰，具有不同的职业。与此同时，我国各方面的人士共5，833人（包括少数代表或代表团先后去两个以上国家的重复数字在内），也曾到过亚洲、欧洲、非洲和美洲地区的33个国家进行友好访问以及其他各种经济和文化交流活动。这个数目比1954年增加了三分之二。
    我国人民同各国人民之间的广泛接触和友好往来，对于加强国际合作增进相互的了解和信任，起了很大的作用。事实证明，这种友好往来和文化交流是促进国际合作与维护世界和平的重要因素之一。
    但同时也应该说明，从第一幅图解中可以看出，我国人民同某些资本主义国家，特别是同美洲国家人民之间的往来，还是很少的。在过去一年内，我国只有很少几个人访问过美洲国家，而美洲国家人民能够前来我国访问的也不多。这种不正常的情况，同美国当局对于各国人民友好往来的限制和阻碍是分不开的。为了实现各国人民的愿望和国际合作的利益，必须消除这种人为的障碍。
    我国人民在1955年内已经在扩大对外联系方面作了积极的努力，并获得了很大的成就。我们希望今后进一步发展和各国人民的友好往来，加强与各国的经济和文化交流，同各国人民团结一起，为维护世界和平的事业而奋斗。（附图片）
