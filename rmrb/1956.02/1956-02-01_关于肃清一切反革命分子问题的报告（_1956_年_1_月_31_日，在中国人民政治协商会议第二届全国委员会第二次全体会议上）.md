    Report on the Question of Eliminating All Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    (January 31, 1956, at the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference)
    Dong Biwu

    I fully agree with the political report made by Chairman Zhou Enlai of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at this meeting. I also fully agree with the report made by Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo on the mission of intellectuals in the high tide of the socialist revolution, and the report made by Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    The current political situation in our country is, as pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong in his speech at the Supreme State Conference on January 25: "Our country is currently in the high tide of the great socialist revolution."

    Starting in the summer of 1955, a high tide of agricultural cooperation was first set off among the 500 million peasants, and is now causing a high tide of agricultural production throughout the country. With the socialist transformation movements of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce also rapidly developing nationwide. It is precisely because socialist transformation and socialist construction are unfolding on such a scale and at such a speed, that it has in turn promoted a new upsurge in the entire national economy and in science, culture, education, health and other undertakings. Before the summer of 1955, many people were worried about whether the unified purchase and sale of grain would work, whether agricultural cooperatives could develop on a large scale, and whether agricultural production could keep up with the needs of industrial development. Now it seems that these problems have been basically solved. The Chinese socialist revolution has now achieved a victory of decisive significance. This victory is great and of world significance. The people of the whole country are rejoicing over this victory. It can be clearly seen that in the face of such a new situation, our country's first five-year plan for the development of the national economy will certainly be completed ahead of schedule and beyond the target, and the overall task of the country during the transition period will certainly be victoriously realized.

    This great victory is the result of a series of struggles waged by the people of the whole country against right-leaning conservative ideas under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and is the result of the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the people of the whole country and the concerted efforts of unity.

    Now, I would like to make the following report to you on the issue of the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements that is currently being carried out throughout the country.

    As you know, we carried out a great suppression of counter-revolutionaries from 1951 to 1953, eliminating a large number of relatively exposed counter-revolutionary elements, severely cracking down on enemies at home and abroad who were plotting to undermine our people's democratic cause, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and raising the political consciousness of the people throughout the country. However, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements were not reconciled to their defeat. On the contrary, they were carrying out various conspiracies and sabotage activities in a more concealed and cunning manner.

    At the Second Session of the First National People's Congress in July 1955, many representatives put forward proposals to continue to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. Everyone agreed that: to tolerate the existence and activities of counter-revolutionary elements would prevent the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation; to smoothly carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is necessary to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements and suppress the activities of counter-revolutionary elements. Item 4 of the "Resolution on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" adopted at that meeting clearly pointed out: "State organs at all levels and the people of the whole country must fully raise their revolutionary vigilance, eliminate all open and hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and smash the sabotage activities of domestic and foreign enemies against our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation." Now, judging from the situation of the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements that has been carried out in various parts of the country during this period, the above-mentioned resolution is entirely correct.

    In order to thoroughly smash the activities of the remaining counter-revolutionary elements and ensure the smooth progress of our country's socialist revolution, we began to launch a struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements throughout the country, starting with the exposure of the criminal activities of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique in the summer of 1955. In this struggle, the counter-revolutionary elements arrested by law in various places included not only the counter-revolutionary elements with serious blood debts and extreme popular resentment left over from the past, but also many hidden counter-revolutionary elements who were carrying out current sabotage activities. Some of them were also special agent spies sent in by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. These counter-revolutionary elements used various cunning and vicious methods to carry out evil activities such as collecting intelligence, sabotaging production, arson and poisoning, and murdering cadres and the masses. In August 1955, the Xia Pu County, Fujian Province, cracked a lurking special agent organization dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Ministry of National Defense Second Bureau" to Yindou Village, Jinguan Township, in the county. The principal offender, Lin Tiezhou, carried a radio station and sneaked into the village from Matsu Island on April 13, 1955, using methods such as winning over, bribing, and intimidation to develop "underground Kuomintang members" to collect intelligence on our army and carry out many sabotage activities. The counter-revolutionary elements Zhu Sanjiu and An Shiguang, who were arrested in Jixian County, Hebei Province, disguised themselves as our public security personnel in December 1955 and killed four peasant activists. Zhao Xuecai, a counter-revolutionary element arrested in Wudu County, Gansu Province, on December 7, 1955, used a knife to kill Zhao Xuelin, the leader of the militia group, Li Xiu'er (female), a peasant, and the son of Zhao Tingfu, a peasant, and set fire to 15 houses. He not only burned to death Li Xiu'er's three-year-old child, but also, in an attempt to frame others, went so far as to burn his own mother to death after tying her up in advance.

    Some counter-revolutionary elements are hidden very deeply and disguised very skillfully. For example, Bai Luochuan, a counter-revolutionary element who had served as the deputy county magistrate of the Kuomintang government in Huade County, Inner Mongolia, had committed great crimes in the past and owed blood debts. After liberation, he absconded in fear of punishment, scalded his face with fried soybeans to make it pockmarked, and hid in the Liu Youfang Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shangyi County, Hebei Province, as an accountant. He was only investigated in this movement. Han Shouwu, a big bully in Taomutun Village, Shenyang City, who had served as the county magistrate of the puppet Manchukuo Changbai County, had killed many cadres of our Anti-Japanese Allied Army before the liberation of Northeast China. After liberation, this counter-revolutionary element fled to Shenyang City and hid in the flower shed of his brother-in-law Zhang Zhongheng's house, and also dug a special hiding cellar in Zhang's kitchen, and also prepared a hidden wooden box and prepared various passwords; it can be said that he had three burrows for a cunning rabbit. This bully had been hiding for more than four years, and also kept land deeds, preparing to settle accounts with the peasants one day when they were restored. But on August 21, 1955, he was finally arrested by the government according to law.

    Counter-revolutionary elements not only hide in some corners of society, but also use various methods to disguise themselves and infiltrate our revolutionary ranks, using two-faced tactics to carry out sabotage activities. There was a counter-revolutionary element named Tang Xianbin, who used to be the captain of the pseudo-self-defense of Dong'an County, Hunan Province, and the director of the pseudo-Five Township Joint Office. He had massacred 12 of our anti-Japanese veterans and killed 13 people. In 1948, he also buried alive an eight-year-old son of a poor peasant. After liberation, he also served as a senior staff officer in the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Anti-Communist Rapid Column". This counter-revolutionary element actually infiltrated Beijing Agricultural University as an associate professor in 1953, and had been hiding for three years before being investigated this time. Recently, we uncovered a counter-revolutionary group case in the coal mining sector. The principal offender, Guo Xiangyu, used to be a senior Kuomintang secret agent and the head of the Kuomintang secret agent organization in the Fuxin Coal Mine, and had carried out many anti-communist and anti-people activities, committing great crimes. Before the liberation, they hid files, burned evidence, and planned to disperse and hide the members of this secret agent group. Guo Xiangyu himself had served as the deputy director of our Pingxiang Mining Bureau and a professor at the Beijing Institute of Geology. Another principal offender, Wang Xuechen, infiltrated Fujian Normal College as a professor. Another principal offender was Geng Bingzhang, who infiltrated Pingxiang Coal Mine as the deputy chief engineer. The remaining counter-revolutionary elements of this group infiltrated the Fuxin, Pingxiang, and Jiaozuo coal mines respectively and hid. They created sabotage accidents in various coal mines and carried out counter-revolutionary activities. However, no matter how cleverly they hid, they were exposed this time.

    Some counter-revolutionary elements also put on the cloak of religion, using religious organizations as a cover to carry out various counter-revolutionary activities. The counter-revolutionary group headed by Gong Pinmei, which was cracked in Shanghai on September 8, 1955, as everyone knows, was a special agent spy group hidden in the Catholic Church that was systematically trained and organized by imperialists.

    In addition, many secret organizations of reactionary sects have been cracked down on in various places.

    The above facts show that the activities of the remaining counter-revolutionary elements are still quite rampant. Obviously, we must not be negligent and must not have any right-leaning tendencies. If we do not severely crack down on these counter-revolutionary elements who are determined to be enemies of the people to the end, then our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation cannot be carried out smoothly.

    Only by eliminating all hidden counter-revolutionary elements can we ensure the smooth progress of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. The people of the whole country are becoming increasingly aware of this truth. In the struggle to realize the country's first five-year plan, the people of the whole country have clearly seen that our country and people's lives are getting better and better day by day, and have seen their bright future. They love their motherland more and more, love the socialist cause more and more, and thus further aroused their infinite hatred for the remaining counter-revolutionary elements. They warmly support and endorse the resolutions of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, and respond to Chairman Mao's call to "raise vigilance and defend the motherland" with positive actions.

    In this struggle, the broad masses of the people exposed and reported many counter-revolutionary elements. Some heinous counter-revolutionary elements who were hidden very deeply were also reported by the masses. Wang Cheng, the murderer who arrested Comrade Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, and the major general security captain during Zhang Zuolin's time, had been hiding in Shenyang City for many years and was recently reported by the masses. Yang Jinxing, the murderer who killed General Yang Hucheng and Comrade Luo Shiwen, the head of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and a military commander of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, changed his name and disguised himself as a poor peasant, hiding in Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, for five years, and was also reported by the masses this time.

    The masses' struggle against counter-revolutionary elements is resolute, decisive, brave, and resourceful. They not only exposed and reported counter-revolutionary elements one after another, but also often directly escorted counter-revolutionary elements to the state's judicial organs after discovering current counter-revolutionary elements; some masses also took the initiative to help the government hunt down fugitive counter-revolutionary elements and actively assisted the government in investigating and cracking down on counter-revolutionary cases. Yu Qinpeng, a worker in Harbin City, not only reported three counter-revolutionary elements with bloody debts, but also did not rest for five days and five nights in order to find the whereabouts of the counter-revolutionary elements; later, he personally led public security personnel to Muling County to arrest a counter-revolutionary element with bloody debts and popular resentment who had been hiding for nine years. From July to November 1955, the masses assisted the government in investigating and cracking down on 379 cases in 24 counties and cities in Heilongjiang Province, including some long-unsolved cases. For example, the case of the special agent organization of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, "Jiamusi Branch of the Northeast Station of the Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense," was cracked with the assistance of Wang Guihua, a housewife in Jiamusi City. In 1955, Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, investigated clearly by the township security and defense committee and the masses, and reported to the government for investigation and verification, and cracked 42 counter-revolutionary cases.

    The fact that the people of the whole country consciously, actively support and participate in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements fully shows that the socialist consciousness and revolutionary vigilance of the masses have been greatly improved, their eyes are brighter, and they have further accumulated experience in distinguishing counter-revolutionary elements and fighting against counter-revolutionary elements. This is the basis for the implementation of our policy of eliminating counter-revolutionary elements, and this is the source of our strength to defeat all enemies.

    Now the political consciousness of the people of the whole country is increasing day by day, and the socialist revolution is advancing rapidly. We are engaged in an extremely glorious and great cause that our ancestors have never done before. People have become increasingly aware that the beautiful and happy life that the Chinese people have dreamed of for thousands of years will be gradually realized by us and the younger generation. It is not difficult to understand that anyone with a little reason will be proud of the increasing prosperity of our motherland, and will feel honored that they can serve the cause of socialist construction. It is also not difficult to understand that under this situation, except for a few counter-revolutionary elements who are truly loyal to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, many counter-revolutionary elements cannot but have some remorse. They feel more and more isolated and have no way out. Only by abandoning the dark and turning to the light and starting anew can they have a bright future. In this struggle, a large number of counter-revolutionary elements, including some major criminals with serious counter-revolutionary crimes, have surrendered to the government one after another, which is a concrete reflection of this situation.

    Here I will only give a few examples of counter-revolutionary elements who surrendered themselves and were tried by the Tianjin Higher People's Court on December 26, 1955. One counter-revolutionary element named Yuan Defu was a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "North China Special Station of the Bureau of Secrecy." He committed great crimes before liberation, and after liberation, he blew up one of our wooden military transport boats and injured six people. Later, he also colluded with other special agents to prepare to organize underground armed forces and manufacture detonators to continue sabotage activities. But not long ago, he chose the path of surrendering himself and starting anew, automatically surrendering himself to the people's government, thoroughly confessing his crimes, handing over the hidden evidence, and also reporting eight accomplices, expressing his sincere repentance. Another counter-revolutionary element named Wang Peihai was the squad leader of the Shandong Linqing County Waterway Police Team during the Japanese puppet period, and later served as the branch station chief of the Railway Police Section of Cangxian County, Hebei Province, under the Kuomintang government. He had killed an innocent woman and used his power to bully and extort the people, committing many crimes. After liberation, he ran to Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, and infiltrated the Beiguan District Wu Lanzhi Mutual Aid Group as an accountant, attempting to hide for a long time. This time, he was afraid of being exposed and attempted to flee again. However, when he saw the report of Minister Luo Ruiqing of the Ministry of Public Security at the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference in the newspaper on the train from Jinzhou to Tianjin, and read the report about the prospects of socialist construction, he felt very excited, but also felt that he had no part in it. When he continued to read the section on thoroughly eliminating counter-revolutionary elements, he put down the newspaper and dared not read any further. While he was feeling uneasy, he suddenly discovered that the report also pointed out a bright path for counter-revolutionary elements, that is, the path of leniency for confession. He finally finished reading the report. He thought back and forth about the fact that Wang Huimin, a counter-revolutionary element with two blood debts in Tianjin City, had been treated leniently due to his thorough confession, as mentioned in the report. Finally, he thought that surrendering himself was his only way out. So he took the newspaper and surrendered himself to the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, thoroughly confessing his crimes. There were also two counter-revolutionary elements named Gao Mingren and Bai Xianglu. Before liberation, Gao Mingren was a special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Bureau of Secrecy and carried out many anti-communist and anti-people crimes. After liberation, he forged his history and infiltrated Tianjin Gegu Middle School as a teacher, continuing to carry out sabotage activities. Bai Xianglu was the puppet baozhang of Baodi County, Hebei Province, during the Japanese puppet period, and later participated in the return-to-village corps, carrying out counter-settlements with the masses. These two counter-revolutionary elements also chose the path of surrendering themselves and starting anew because they had some remorse. The people's courts have leniently or exempted the above-mentioned counter-revolutionary elements from punishment according to law. There are many such examples all over the country. Some counter-revolutionary elements said when they surrendered themselves: "I am willing to become a clean person and enter socialism." There is no doubt that the people welcome their repentance and reform, and the state treats them leniently.

    Our policy toward counter-revolutionary elements has always been a policy that combines suppression and leniency, that is, the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, meritorious service to offset crimes, and rewards for great meritorious service." All counter-revolutionary elements who refuse to confess, adhere to their counter-revolutionary stance, and continue to be enemies of the people will be severely punished by the law. But as long as they can sincerely confess and repent, even if they have committed serious crimes, they will certainly be treated leniently by the state. As long as they confess thoroughly and make contributions, they can not only get a commutation of sentence or exemption from punishment, but also be given the opportunity to participate in production or work.

    We strictly distinguish between those who only have reactionary ideas but no counter-revolutionary activities and those who are counter-revolutionary elements. Ideological problems are problems of education and transformation, and we can only use criticism and education to help them correct their mistakes. We strictly distinguish between people with general counter-revolutionary problems in the past and current counter-revolutionary elements in handling them. For those who have general counter-revolutionary problems in the past but have no current sabotage activities, as long as they thoroughly explain the problems, they can be exempted from punishment or treated leniently. We strictly distinguish between those religious believers who are deceived and used by counter-revolutionary elements to do some bad things and those counter-revolutionary elements who systematically carry out sabotage activities under the guise of religion in the policy of treating them. The former mainly educate them, raise their awareness, and be vigilant against counter-revolutionary elements using our country's freedom of religious belief to undermine religious organizations and carry out counter-revolutionary activities. We strictly distinguish between those general backward small organizations and small groups with truly counter-revolutionary nature in the policy of treating them. Of course, those feudal, rogue, and especially small organizations used by counter-revolutionary elements must be opposed. Those with bad circumstances must also be given the punishment they deserve. But it is mainly a matter of criticism and education. We strictly distinguish between responsibility accidents in production and work and sabotage accidents carried out by counter-revolutionary elements in handling them. Of course, responsibility accidents that cause significant losses to the interests of the state and the people will also be subject to due punishment and even legal sanctions. But this is also different from the handling of sabotage accidents by counter-revolutionary elements. In addition, there are some specific principles of differentiated treatment in other aspects. In short, the handling should be completely in line with the actual situation, completely in line with the country's policies, seek truth from facts, in order to achieve the purpose of punishing crimes and protecting the good.

    Recently, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967." Article 5 of which specially stipulates the handling of counter-revolutionary elements in rural areas: "(1) Those who carry out sabotage activities and those who have serious crimes in history and are deeply resented by the people should be arrested and dealt with according to law. (2) Those who only have general historical crimes, have no current sabotage activities and are not deeply resented by the people should be handed over by the township people's committee to the cooperative to control production and reform through labor. (3) Those who only have minor crimes, have now repented, those who have been released after serving their sentences and have performed well, and those who have made significant contributions to suppressing counter-revolutionaries, may be allowed to join the society, and depending on the extent of their repentance and the size of their contributions, some are regarded as members, remove the counter-revolutionary hat, and are called peasants; some are regarded as probationary members and are not given the title of peasant for the time being. However, regardless of whether they have obtained the title of member, they are not allowed to hold any important positions in the society for a certain period of time after joining the society. (4) For counter-revolutionary elements who are handed over to the cooperative to control production, the cooperative should adopt the principle of equal pay for equal work and give them the labor income they deserve. (5) For the families of counter-revolutionary elements, as long as they have not participated in criminal activities, they should be allowed to join the society and should be treated the same as ordinary members without discrimination." I believe that these new regulations are completely suitable for the current new situation in rural areas, and are precisely the specific development of our consistent policy of combining suppression and leniency.

    For those counter-revolutionary elements who have been arrested according to law, except for a very small number who have committed heinous crimes, are incorrigible, seriously endanger the interests of the state and the people, and are deeply resented by the people, they should be sentenced to death according to law. The rest are sentenced to imprisonment according to law and reformed through labor, so that they have the opportunity to start anew in the process of reform through labor. After reform through labor, the vast majority of them have developed labor habits, learned production technology, and changed into new people who support themselves. For example, more than 60% of counter-revolutionary elements and other criminals in Zhejiang Province who participate in industrial labor have learned production technology, and some have been able to manufacture new agricultural tools such as water pumps, threshers, and grain seeders. The vast majority of those who participate in agricultural production have learned production skills. After serving their sentences and being released after reform through labor, some have returned home to participate in production, some have been introduced to jobs by labor reform organs, and some have requested to stay in labor reform organs or places as employees to participate in production, and have brought their families to settle down and establish a career. Some prisoners have been praised for their good labor production after being released, and some have been elected as labor models. Therefore, our policy of reforming criminals through labor has not only won the support of the broad masses of the people, but also been sincerely supported and appreciated by repentant criminals and their families. Some prisoners said: "The Communist Party has transformed me, and the Communist Party is my reborn parent." This policy can not only transform counter-revolutionary elements and other criminals into new people, but also gradually eliminate crime from the root, and it embodies the principle of great revolutionary humanitarianism.

    Undoubtedly, our struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements this time has achieved great victories under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the active support of the broad masses of the people, and with the close cooperation of the people's courts, people's procuratorates, and people's public security organs. After this struggle, the people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been further weakened, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements have been further reduced, our experience in fighting with the people and the masses has been further enriched, and the activities of the remaining counter-revolutionary elements have become more difficult.

    But can we conclude from this that counter-revolutionary elements will disappear from now on, and their activities are not worth worrying about? Obviously, we cannot. We must see that although the remaining counter-revolutionary elements have been further reduced, they have not been completely eliminated. Now imperialism is still surrounding us, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan has not been eliminated. They are still increasingly stepping up their efforts to send special agent spies to our country. At the same time, in the future, a very small number of people who adhere to the position of the exploiting class may carry out counter-revolutionary activities under the exploitation of the enemy. All counter-revolutionary elements and special agent spies at home and abroad who are determined to be enemies of the people will never be reconciled to failure because of the victory of our socialist construction and socialist transformation. Although the road for counter-revolutionary elements is getting narrower and narrower, they will inevitably make a dying struggle and carry out more hidden and vicious sabotage activities. Therefore, we must never breed right-leaning paralysis because we have achieved victory; we must never only see the people and the masses everywhere in the high tide of the socialist revolution, with gongs and drums, lanterns and colorful decorations, celebrating the victory of socialist transformation, and forget that there are still enemies, and relax our vigilance against the remaining counter-revolutionary elements.

    Our state organs at all levels and the people of the whole country must continue to implement the "Resolution on the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" of the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, fully raise revolutionary vigilance, and carry out the struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements to the end. Our National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should continue to implement this resolution together with the people of the whole country. This is also a better implementation of the provisions of the general program of the "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference": "Strengthening the work of unity among the people of all ethnic groups in the country, carrying forward the spirit of patriotism, raising revolutionary vigilance, defending national construction, and adhering to the struggle against enemies at home and abroad."

    I fully believe that we will certainly strengthen our work more effectively in the future, so that all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations in our country will be more closely united, and in accordance with the correct policy of "raising vigilance, eliminating all special agents; preventing deviations, and not wronging a good person" as instructed by Chairman Mao, continue to resolutely and deeply carry out the struggle to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements, so as to ensure that our country's great socialist construction and socialist transformation cause wins even more brilliant victories.

    关于肃清一切反革命分子问题的报告
    （1956年1月31日，在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第二次全体会议上）
    董必武
    我完全同意中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会周恩来主席在这次会议上所作的政治报告。我也完全同意郭沫若副主席所作的在社会主义革命高潮中知识分子的使命的报告和陈叔通副主席所作的关于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的报告。
    现在我们国家的政治形势，正如毛泽东主席在1月25日召开的最高国务会议上的讲话中所指出的：“目前我国正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中。”
    从1955年夏季开始在五万万农民中首先掀起了一个农业合作化的高潮，并且正在引起全国农业生产的高潮，随着手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造运动在全国范围内也迅速地开展起来。正由于社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业是以这样的规模和速度展开着，因此，也就转而促进整个国民经济和科学、文化、教育、卫生等项事业的新高涨。1955年夏季以前，曾经有许多人耽心的粮食统购统销是否行得通、农业合作社是否能够大量发展、农业生产是否赶得上工业发展的需要等问题，现在看来，这些问题已经基本上解决了。中国的社会主义革命现在已经获得了具有决定意义的胜利。这个胜利是伟大的，是具有世界意义的。全国人民正在为这个胜利而欢欣鼓舞。这就明显地可以看出，在这样新形势的前面，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，一定能够提前和超额完成，国家在过渡时期的总任务，一定能够胜利实现。
    这个伟大的胜利，是全国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，进行了反对右倾保守思想的一系列斗争的结果，是全国人民的社会主义觉悟的提高和团结一致共同努力的结果。
    现在，我想就目前全国正在开展着的肃清一切反革命分子斗争的这个问题，向大家作如下的报告。
    大家知道，我们在1951年到1953年进行过伟大的镇压反革命运动，扫除了一大批比较暴露的反革命分子，狠狠地打击了国内外阴谋破坏我国人民民主事业的敌人，巩固了人民民主专政，提高了全国人民的政治觉悟。但是残余的反革命分子并没有甘心于他们的失败，相反地，他们却更加隐蔽更加狡猾地在进行各种阴谋破坏活动。
    1955年7月第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上，曾有不少代表提出了继续肃清反革命分子的提案。大家一致认为：要容忍反革命分子存在和活动，就不能顺利地进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造；要顺利地进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，就必须肃清一切反革命分子和镇压反革命分子的活动。在那次会议上通过的“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的决议”中，第四项就明确地指出：“各级国家机关和全国人民必须充分地提高革命的警惕性，肃清一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子，粉碎国内国外敌人对我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的破坏活动。”现在，从这一时期全国各地开展的肃清反革命分子斗争的情况来看，上述这一项决议是完全正确的。
    为了彻底粉碎残余反革命分子的活动，保障我国社会主义革命的顺利进行，我们从1955年夏揭露胡风反革命集团的罪恶活动开始，在全国范围内开展了肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争。在这次斗争中，各地依法逮捕的反革命分子，不仅有过去残留下来的有严重血债和民愤极大的反革命分子，而且有许多是进行现行破坏活动的暗藏反革命分子。其中一部分还是帝国主义、蒋介石集团派遣进来的特务间谍分子。这些反革命分子用各种狡猾毒辣手段，进行搜集情报、破坏生产、纵火放毒、凶杀干部和群众等罪恶活动。福建霞浦县1955年8月破获了蒋介石集团“国防部二厅”派遣在这个县金官乡印斗村的潜伏特务组织。主犯林铁舟携带电台，于1955年4月13日由马祖岛潜入该村，用拉拢收买恐吓等办法，发展“地下国民党员”，进行搜集我军情报等许多破坏活动。河北冀县逮捕的反革命分子朱三九和安世广，在1955年12月化装冒充我公安人员，先后杀死农民积极分子4人。甘肃武都县逮捕的一个反革命分子赵学才，在1955年12月7日，用刀砍死民兵组长赵学林、农民李秀儿（女）和农民赵廷福的儿子，并且纵火烧毁房屋15间。他不仅把李秀儿的一个3岁的小孩烧死在内，而且他为了企图嫁祸于人，竟至绝灭人性到这样地步：把自己的母亲事先绑起来一同烧死。
    有些反革命分子隐藏得很深，伪装得很巧妙。例如曾在内蒙化德县当过国民党政府副县长的反革命分子白洛川，过去罪恶很大，负有血债。解放后他畏罪潜逃，用炒豆子把自己的面孔烫成麻子，潜藏到河北尚义县刘油房村供销合作社里当了会计。在这次运动中才被清查出来。曾经当过日伪长白县长的沈阳市桃木屯村的大恶霸韩守武，在东北解放前杀害过我抗日联军的干部多人。解放后这个反革命分子逃到沈阳市内，躲藏在他姐夫张中衡家的天花棚里，而且还在张家厨房里又挖了一个专门躲藏的地洞，另外还准备了一个隐蔽的木箱，预备了各种暗号；真可以说是狡兔三窟。这个恶霸一直暗藏了4年多的时间，还保存着地契，准备有朝一日他们复辟的时候，向农民进行倒算。但是在1955年8月21日，终于被政府依法逮捕了。
    反革命分子不仅在社会上某些角落里暗藏起来，而且用各种办法伪装起来，钻入我们革命队伍内部，用两面手法，进行破坏活动。有一个反革命分子叫唐宪斌，他过去是湖南省东安县伪自卫大队长和伪五乡联合办事处主任，曾经屠杀我抗日退伍军人12人，杀死群众13人，1948年还把一个贫农的8岁的儿子活埋了。解放以后，他又在蒋介石集团“反共快速纵队”当过高级参谋。这个反革命分子，在1953年竟然混入北京农业大学当了副教授，一直暗藏了3年，这次才被清查出来。最近，我们在煤矿部门中破获了一个反革命集团案件。主犯郭象豫，过去是国民党高级特务，是阜新煤矿国民党特务组织的负责人，进行过许多反共反人民的活动，罪恶很大。在临解放前，他们隐藏档案，烧毁罪证，有计划地把这个特务集团中的分子分散潜伏起来。郭象豫本人就曾经当过我们萍乡矿务局的副局长和北京地质学院的教授。另一个主犯王学忱，混入到福建师范学院当了教授。还有一个主犯叫耿秉璋，混入萍乡煤矿当了副总工程师。这个集团的其余的反革命分子，分别混入到阜新、萍乡、焦作煤矿里，暗藏起来。他们在各个煤矿中制造破坏事故，进行反革命活动。但是，无论他们暗藏得多么巧妙，这次也被揭露了出来。
    还有些反革命分子披着宗教的外衣，以宗教团体为掩护，进行各种反革命活动。大家知道的1955年9月8日上海市破获的以龚品梅为首的反革命集团，就是帝国主义者有计划地训练和组织起来的暗藏在天主教内的特务间谍集团。
    此外，各地还破获了不少反动会道门的秘密组织。
    以上这些事实，说明残余的反革命分子的活动还是相当猖獗的。显然，我们对此绝不能够麻痹大意，绝不能有任何右倾的倾向。如果不对这些决心与人民为敌的顽抗到底的反革命分子给以严厉地打击，那么，我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，就不可能顺利地进行。
    肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子，才能保障我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。这样一个道理，全国人民群众一天比一天认识得清楚了。全国人民群众在实现国家的第一个五年计划的奋斗中，已经清楚地看到了我们的国家和人民生活一天比一天更好，看到了自己美好的未来。他们更加热爱祖国，更加热爱社会主义事业，因而进一步激起了对于残余反革命分子的无比愤恨。他们热烈地支持和拥护第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议的决议，并且以积极的行动来响应毛主席所提出的：“提高警惕，保卫祖国”的号召。
    在这次斗争中，广大群众揭发、检举出许多反革命分子。有些隐藏得很深的罪大恶极的反革命分子，也被群众检举出来了。曾经捕害中国共产党创始人之一李大钊同志的凶犯、张作霖时代的少将保安队长王澄，在沈阳市隐藏了多年，最近被群众检举出来。曾经杀害杨虎成将军和中国共产党四川省委负责人罗世文同志的凶犯、蒋介石集团的军统特务分子杨进兴，改名换姓，伪装贫农，在四川南充县隐藏了5年之久，这次也被群众检举了出来。
    群众对于反革命分子的斗争，是坚决果敢的，英勇机智的。他们不仅纷纷对反革命分子进行揭发、检举，而且常常在发现现行反革命分子之后，就把反革命分子直接扭送到国家的司法机关；有些群众还主动地帮助政府追捕逃亡的反革命分子和积极地协助政府侦察破获反革命案件。哈尔滨市工人于钦朋，不但检举了3个血债累累的反革命分子，而且为了寻找反革命分子的下落，曾经有5天5夜没有休息；以后又亲自带引公安人员到穆棱县去，把一个隐藏了9年的有血债民愤的反革命分子逮捕归案。黑龙江省24个县、市，1955年7月到11月，群众协助政府侦察破获的案件就有379起，其中还有一些是长期未破的悬案。如像蒋介石集团特务组织“国防部二厅东北站佳木斯支站”一案，就是佳木斯市的一个家庭妇女王桂华协助政府破获的。山西省解虞县在1955年由乡治安保卫委员会和群众调查清楚以后，报请政府侦察属实而破获的反革命案件，就有42起。
    全国人民群众这样自觉地积极地支持和参加肃清反革命分子斗争的事实，充分说明，群众的社会主义觉悟和革命警惕性大大地提高了，眼睛更亮了，并且进一步积累了辨别反革命分子和同反革命分子作斗争的经验。这就是我们肃清反革命分子的政策能够贯彻执行的基础，这就是我们战胜一切敌人的力量的源泉。
    现在全国人民群众的政治觉悟正日益提高，社会主义革命事业正迅速地前进，我们正在进行着我们的先人从未作过的极其光荣伟大的事业。人们已经越来越清楚地看到，中国人民几千年来梦想不到的美好幸福的生活，将要由我们和年青的一代来逐步地实现。不难了解，一切稍有理智的人，都会因我们的祖国日益富强而感到骄傲，都会因自己能够为社会主义建设事业服务而感到光荣。也不难了解，在此形势下，除少数真正死心塌地效忠于帝国主义和蒋介石集团的反革命分子而外，许多反革命分子，也不能不有所悔悟，他们感到越来越孤立，越来越走头无路，只有弃暗投明，重作新人，才是自己唯一的光明前途。在这次斗争中，大批的反革命分子，甚至包括一部分有严重反革命罪行的要犯，纷纷向政府投案自首，正是这种情势的具体反映。
    这里我仅举天津市高级人民法院，在1955年12月26日一起审判的几个投案自首的反革命分子的例子。有一个反革命分子叫袁德福，原是蒋介石集团“保密局华北特别站”的特务，解放前罪恶很大，解放后曾炸坏我们的军运木船一只，炸伤6人，后来还纠合其他特务分子，准备组织地下武装，制造雷管，继续进行破坏活动。但是不久以前他选择了投案自新的道路，自动地向人民政府自首，彻底坦白了他的罪行，交出了隐藏的罪证，并且还检举了同案主从犯8名，表示了真诚悔过。另有一个反革命分子叫汪培海，在日伪时期是山东临清县水路警备队小队长，后来又当过国民党政府河北沧县铁路警务段分驻所长，曾经杀死一个无辜妇女，仗势欺负勒索人民，罪恶很多。解放后，他跑到黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市，混进北关区武兰芝互助组里当了会计，企图长期隐藏下来。这次他害怕被人揭露出来，又企图潜逃。但是，当他在从锦州到天津的火车上，看见报上登载的公安部罗瑞卿部长在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上的报告，读到报告中所说的社会主义建设的远景，他感到非常兴奋，可是又觉得自己没份。当他继续读到彻底肃清反革命分子的一段，就放下报纸不敢再看下去了。正在心绪不安的时候，忽然发现报告中的对于反革命分子还指出了一条光明的道路，即坦白从宽的道路，他终于读完了这个报告。他反来复去想报告中所说的天津市一个有两条血债的反革命分子王惠民由于彻底坦白受到了宽大处理的事实，最后，他想到自己只有投案自首，才是唯一的出路，于是拿着那张报纸向天津市人民政府自首，彻底交代了自己的罪行。还有两名反革命分子叫高明仁和白向禄。高明仁在解放前是蒋介石集团保密局的特务，进行了许多反共反人民的罪恶活动，解放后伪造历史，混入天津葛沽中学当了教员，继续进行破坏活动。白向禄在日伪时期是河北省宝坻县伪保长，后来又参加还乡团，向群众进行过倒算。这两名反革命分子，也因为有所悔悟，选择了投案自新的道路。上述这几个反革命分子，人民法院都依法从轻或免予处刑。这样的事例，在全国各地是很多的。有的反革命分子在投案自首的时候说：“我愿成为一个干干净净的人，进入社会主义”。毫无疑问的，人民对他们的这种悔过自新的行为是欢迎的，国家对他们的处理是宽大的。
    我们对反革命分子的政策，从来就是镇压与宽大相结合的政策，这就是“坦白从宽，抗拒从严，立功折罪，立大功受奖”的政策。一切反革命分子，如果拒不坦白，坚持反革命立场，继续与人民为敌，一定要受到国法的严厉惩处。但是只要能够真诚坦白，悔过自新，那怕就是罪恶严重的，也一定会得到国家的宽大处理，并且只要坦白得彻底，立有功劳，不仅可以获得减刑或者免予处刑，而且还给以参加生产或工作的机会。
    我们对于只有反动思想而没有反革命活动的分子，同对待反革命分子是有严格区别的。思想问题是教育改造的问题，只能采用批评教育的办法，帮助他们改正错误。我们对于历史上有一般反革命问题的人，同现行的反革命分子在处理上是有严格区别的。对于那些历史上有一般反革命问题而没有现行破坏活动的分子，只要他们彻底交代了问题，就可以免予处刑或者从宽处理。我们对于那些被反革命分子蒙蔽、利用作了一些坏事的宗教信徒，同披着宗教外衣有计划地进行破坏活动的反革命分子，在对待的政策上是有严格区别的。对于前者主要是教育他们，提高认识，警惕反革命分子利用我国宗教信仰的自由，来破坏宗教团体和进行反革命活动。我们对于那些一般落后的小组织，同真正反革命性质的小集团在对待的政策上是有严格区别的。当然，对于那些封建的、流氓性质的、特别为反革命分子利用的小组织，都是必须反对的。对于那些情节恶劣的还必须给以应得的惩处。但主要是进行批评教育的问题。我们对于生产和工作中的责任事故，同反革命分子进行的破坏事故，在处理上是有严格区别的。当然，造成国家和人民利益重大损失的责任事故，也要受到应得的处罚甚至法律的制裁。但是这也同对于反革命分子破坏事故的处理是有区别的。此外，在其他方面，还有一些区别对待的具体原则。总之，要使处理完全符合于实际情况，完全符合于国家的政策，实事求是，以达到惩罚罪恶，保护善良的目的。
    最近，中国共产党中央提出了“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”。其中的第五条，对于农村中的反革命分子的处理，特别规定了：“（1）进行破坏活动的分子和在历史上有严重罪行民愤很大的分子，逮捕法办。（2）只有一般的历史罪行，没有现行破坏活动民愤不大的分子，由乡人民委员会交合作社管制生产，劳动改造。（3）只有轻微罪行，现在已经悔改的分子，刑满释放表现好的分子，以及虽有罪行，但是对于镇压反革命立有显著功劳的分子，可以允许他们入社，并且根据他悔改的程度和功劳的大小，有的做为社员，摘掉反革命帽子，称为农民；有的做为候补社员，暂不给以农民的称号。但是，无论是否已经取得社员的称号，在入社以后的一定时期内，都不许担任社内任何重要的职务。（4）对于交合作社管制生产的反革命分子，合作社应当采取同工同酬的原则，给他们以应有的劳动所得。（5）对于反革命分子的家属，只要他们没有参与犯罪行为，应当允许他们入社，并且应当同一般社员同等待遇，不要歧视他们。”我认为这些新的规定，完全适合当前农村的新情况的，也正是我们所一贯实行的镇压与宽大相结合的政策的具体发展。
    我们对于已经依法逮捕起来的反革命分子，除其中极少数罪大恶极，怙恶不悛，严重危害国家、人民利益和民愤很大的分子，应当依法判处死刑外，其余的是依法判处徒刑，实行劳动改造，让他们在劳动改造的过程中有重新作人的机会。经过劳动改造，他们中的绝大多数人都养成了劳动习惯，学会了生产技术，改变成为自食其力的新人。例如浙江省参加工业劳动的反革命分子和其他罪犯，有60％以上都学会了生产技术，有的已经能够制造抽水机、脱粒机、谷物播种机等新式农具。参加农业生产的，绝大多数学会了生产技能。经过劳动改造刑满以后，有的回家参加了生产，有的由劳改机关介绍了职业，有的请求留在劳动改造机关或场所当员工，参加生产，并且接来家眷，安家立业。有些犯人在刑满释放后，由于劳动生产很好，还受到了表扬，也有被选为劳动模范的。因此，我们对罪犯实行劳动改造的政策，不仅取得了广大群众的拥护，就是悔过自新的犯人和他们的家属，也真诚地拥护和感激政府。有的犯人说：“共产党改造了我，共产党是我再生的父母”。这个政策不仅可以把反革命分子和其他犯罪分子改造成为新人，并且可以逐步从根本上消灭犯罪，它体现了伟大的革命人道主义的原则。
    毫无疑义，我们这次肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争，在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在广大人民群众的积极支持下，并在人民法院、人民检察院和人民公安机关密切配合下，已经取得了很大的胜利。经过这次斗争，人民民主专政更加巩固了，反革命残余势力更加削弱了，残余的反革命分子更加减少了，我们和人民群众的斗争经验也更加丰富了，残余反革命分子的活动更加困难了。
    但是，我们能不能由此得出结论说：反革命分子将从此消声敛迹，他们的活动就不足为患了呢？显然是不能够的。我们必须看到残余反革命分子虽然更加减少了，但是，它们还没有被彻底肃清。现在帝国主义还在包围着我们，盘踞在台湾的蒋介石集团还未消灭，他们还在日益加紧地向我们国内派遣特务间谍分子，同时，在今后，极少数坚持剥削阶级立场的分子，还可能在敌人的利用之下进行反革命活动。所有国内外的坚决与人民为敌的反革命分子和特务间谍分子，决不会因为我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利而甘心失败。虽然反革命分子的道路是越走越狭了，但是，他们必然还会作垂死的挣扎，进行更隐蔽更毒辣的破坏活动。因此，我们绝不可以因为已经取得了胜利，而滋生右倾麻痹的思想；绝不可以只看到在社会主义革命的高潮中，人民群众到处锣鼓喧天，张灯结彩，庆祝社会主义改造的胜利，而忘记了还有敌人存在，放松了对残余反革命分子的警惕。
    我们各级国家机关和全国人民，必须继续贯彻执行第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议“关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的决议”，充分地提高革命的警惕性，把肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争进行到底。我们人民政治协商会议全国委员会，更应当同全国人民一道继续贯彻执行这一决议。这样也就是更好地执行了“中国人民政治协商会议章程”总纲中的规定：“在全国各族人民中加强团结工作，发扬爱国主义精神，提高革命警惕性，保卫国家建设，坚持对国内外敌人的斗争。”
    我完全相信，我们今后一定会更有成效地加强我们的工作，使我们全国各民族，各民主阶级，各民主党派和各人民团体更加密切地团结起来，按照毛主席所指示的：“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”的正确方针，继续坚决地、深入地进行肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的斗争，以保障我国伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业获得更加辉煌的胜利。
