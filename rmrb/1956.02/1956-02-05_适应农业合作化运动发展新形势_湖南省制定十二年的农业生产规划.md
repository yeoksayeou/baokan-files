    To Adapt to the New Situation in the Development of the Agricultural Cooperative Movement
    Hunan Province Formulates a Twelve-Year Agricultural Production Plan
    To adapt to the new situation of the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement, Hunan Province has initially formulated a production plan centered on the development of the agricultural cooperative movement from 1956 to 1967. According to this plan, from now until the spring plowing this year, Hunan Province will establish more than 3,000 advanced agricultural production cooperatives. The number of farmers joining advanced cooperatives will account for about 8% of the total number of farmers in the province. By the second half of this year, it will be developed to about 30%. It is estimated that by the winter of 1958, the province can basically realize the all-socialist agricultural cooperation.
    In terms of agricultural production, the plan stipulates that grain production should be the main focus, and the agricultural economy should be developed in an all-round way. By 1962, the average grain yield per mu of cultivated land in the province is required to reach 800 jin, and by 1967, the average per mu should reach 1,000 jin, so that the total grain output of the province will reach 60 billion jin. By then, calculated according to the current agricultural population of Hunan Province, each person will have an average of 2,000 jin of grain. In terms of forestry production, starting this year, barren mountains will be eliminated and the entire province will be greened within 10 years.
    Hunan has a mild climate, abundant grass resources, and rivers, lakes, and mountain ponds are as dense as spider webs. Therefore, the plan also stipulates that animal husbandry, aquatic products, and various agricultural and sideline industries should also be developed in a planned and proportionate manner. To this end, it is required to basically eliminate ordinary floods and droughts within three to five years. In the Dongting Lake area, one of the granaries of the motherland, in conjunction with the fundamental cure of the Yangtze River, embankments and streams will be gradually merged to reorganize the drainage and irrigation system; in hilly areas, medium-sized and small reservoirs will be vigorously built, and mechanical drainage and irrigation projects will be constructed; in mountainous areas where the land is high and water is difficult to obtain, pumping stations will be established. In the next two years, the cultivated land area irrigated by pumps is required to increase to more than 16 million mu. In addition, dams will be built across rivers to block and store mountain torrents, and rich water resources will be used to build small hydropower stations to supply electricity needed for rural lighting and irrigation.
    The plan also requires basically eliminating crop diseases, insect pests, birds, and animal damage within 7 years. In addition, corresponding plans have also been made for rural culture, education, health, transportation, and other aspects. (Xinhua News Agency)

    适应农业合作化运动发展新形势
    湖南省制定十二年的农业生产规划
    为适应农业合作化运动迅速发展的新形势，湖南省已经初步制定了1956年到1967年以发展农业合作化运动为中心的生产规划。根据这个规划，湖南省从现在开始到今年春耕以前，要建立3，000多个高级农业生产合作社，加入高级社的农户约占全省农户总数的8％，到今年下半年再发展到30％左右，这样，预计到1958年冬全省就可基本上实现全社会主义的农业合作化。
    这个规划，在农业生产方面，规定以增产粮食为主全面地发展农业经济，到1962年，要求全省每亩耕地粮食产量平均达到800斤，到1967年，平均每亩达到1，000斤，使全省粮食总产量达到600亿斤。到那时，按湖南省现有农业人口计算，每人平均将有2，000斤粮食。在林业生产方面，从今年开始，要在10年内消灭荒山，绿化全省。
    湖南气候温和、草源丰富，内河湖泊、山塘密如蛛网，因此，规划中还规定畜牧、水产和各种农副业也要有计划地按比例发展。为此，要求在三、五年内基本上消灭普通的水灾、旱灾。在祖国粮仓之一的洞庭湖区，要结合根治长江，逐步实行并垸并流，整理排水灌溉系统；丘陵区将要大力兴修中、小型水库，建设机械排水灌溉工程；在田地高亢取水不便的山区，将建立抽水机站，在今后两年内，用抽水机引水灌溉的耕地面积要求增加到1，600多万亩。此外，还要拦河筑坝，堵蓄山洪，利用丰富的水源，建设小型水力发电站，以供应农村照明和灌溉所需要的电力。
    规划还要求在7年内基本上消灭农作物的病虫鸟兽害。此外，对农村的文化、教育、卫生和交通运输等方面也作了相应的规划。（新华社）
