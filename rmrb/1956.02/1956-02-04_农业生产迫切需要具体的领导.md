In the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, a new production upsurge has emerged with the development of the agricultural cooperation movement. Formulating production plans, tapping production potential, and actively carrying out winter production have become the main activities of farmers in various places.

Many places regard building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects and expanding cultivated land area as the key to increasing agricultural production. Farmers in Keshan County have reclaimed 4,500 hectares of wasteland by the end of last year, and plan to reclaim another 3,500 hectares. The masses have found 47 ponds, 8 ditches, and 59 springs, and plan to use these natural water flows to plant 2,200 hectares of paddy fields. In Binhe District of this county, six villages jointly built a relatively large reservoir next to the Wuyuer River, which can irrigate 600 hectares of rice. Farmers in Huanan County have built more than 100,000 meters of drainage ditches themselves, including one project in the 9th District that is 12 meters wide and 30 *li* long, with preliminary plans to plant more than 2,000 hectares of paddy fields. Among the 43 small-scale water conservancy projects that have been completed in Shangzhi County, some have also established small-scale hydroelectric power stations. In Huilong District of Huachuan County, 40 agricultural production cooperatives have organized year-round wasteland reclamation teams and wasteland survey groups. Many agricultural production cooperatives in Zhaodong County are actively organizing the pulling of sand to improve the soil.

In the past, farmers added carts, bought horses, and prepared for spring plowing mostly in the spring, but now they have moved it up a quarter. The 342 rubber-tired carts and 477 iron carts that had been backlogged for several years in Baiquan and Zhaozhou counties have all been sold out since last autumn. Many agricultural production cooperatives, especially old cooperatives and newly established advanced cooperatives, have also bought cattle, sheep, and pigs to develop animal husbandry and formulate production plans for developing diversified economies. Agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province have already begun to select seeds, haul manure, and deliver manure, actively preparing for spring plowing and production.

In the face of such a mass, large-scale new production upsurge, the leadership in many regions still does not have a clear understanding of the development trend of the new production upsurge, and their thinking and actions are still lagging behind reality. This is specifically manifested in: narrow plans, low targets, lack of thorough planning and unified arrangements, specific organizational leadership failing to keep up, insufficient supply of means of production, and so on. Huachuan County originally planned to reclaim 7,000 *qing*, but by the end of last year, it had already exceeded 1,000 *qing*; the original plan for 1956 was to increase paddy fields by 400 hectares, but after mobilizing the masses, it increased to 3,500 hectares; the original plan was to promote 50 sets of new-style animal-powered farm implements, but as a result, 150 sets were promoted and were still not enough, and farmers still wanted to buy 200 double-wheeled, double-bottom plows; the original plan was to buy 350 draft horses, but as a result, 400 were bought, and they were all sold out in five days, and the cooperatives still wanted to buy 700; the original plan was to need 600,000 *jin* of superphosphate of lime, but as a result, the Second District alone bought 300,000 *jin*; the original plan was to afforest 330 *qing* in the whole county, but one district planned to afforest 100 *qing*... These situations show that the leadership's plans are far from the demands of the masses. This situation is not isolated, but rather universal. Some rural leaders even treat the enthusiasm of the masses for developing production with a skeptical, perfunctory, and negative attitude, regardless of the circumstances and without investigation. These erroneous ideas and practices have already caused some losses to the newly emerging production upsurge. Rural workers should quickly overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and lead this huge-scale production movement with the revolutionary spirit of socialism and a concrete and meticulous working style.

    农业生产迫切需要具体的领导
    金浪白　于喜滨
    在黑龙江省的农村里，随着农业合作化运动的发展，已经出现了一个新的生产高潮。制定生产规划，挖掘生产潜力，积极进行冬季生产，已经成为各地农民的主要活动。
    许多地方都把兴修小型农田水利和扩大耕地面积作为农业增产的关键。克山县农民在去年年底已经开荒4，500公顷；还计划开垦3，500公顷。群众已经找到泡子47处、水沟子8处、泉眼59处，计划利用这些自然水流种2，200公顷水田。这个县的滨河区，6个村在乌裕尔河水旁边联合修建了一个比较大的储水库，可以灌溉600公顷水稻。桦南县农民自己修的排水沟达10万多公尺，其中9区一个工程就有12公尺宽，30华里长，初步规划能种2，000多公顷水田。尚志县已经修成的43处小型水利工程中，有几处还建立了小型水力发电站。桦川县会龙区有40个农业生产合作社组织了常年开荒队和荒源测量组。肇东县很多农业生产合作社正在积极组织拉沙子改良土壤。
    过去农民添车买马、准备春耕多在春季，现在提前了一个季度。拜泉、肇州两县积压了几年的342台胶皮车和477台铁车，去年秋季以来，已经全部卖光了。还有很多农业生产合作社，特别是老社和新建的高级社，纷纷买牛买羊买猪发展畜牧业，制定发展多种经济的生产计划。全省各地有许多农业生产合作社已经开始选种、倒粪、送粪，积极准备春耕生产。
    在这样一个群众性的、规模宏大的新的生产高潮面前，不少地区的领导方面对新的生产高潮的发展趋势仍然认识不清，思想和行动仍然落后于实际。具体表现在：计划狭小，指标偏低，缺乏周密计划和统一安排，具体的组织领导工作跟不上，生产资料供应不足……。桦川县原计划开荒7，000垧，到去年年底已经超过1，000多垧；原来计划1956年水田可以增加400公顷，把群众发动起来以后增加到3，500公顷；原计划推广新式畜力农具50套，结果推广了150套还不足用，农民还要买200台双轮双铧犁；原计划买进350匹耕马，结果买进来400匹，五天就全部卖光了，各社还要买700匹；原计划需要60万斤过磷酸石灰，结果只是第二区就买了30万斤；原计划全县造林330垧，可是一个区就计划造林100垧……这些情况说明，领导方面的计划和群众的要求相差太远。这种情况并不是个别的，而是带有普遍性的。有些农村领导人员，甚至不分情况，不作调查，盲目地一律以怀疑、应付、否定的态度来对待群众发展生产的热情。这些错误的思想和做法，已经使刚刚出现的生产高潮受到一些损失了。农村工作人员应当迅速克服右倾保守思想，以社会主义的革命精神和具体细致的工作作风来领导这个规模巨大的大生产运动。
