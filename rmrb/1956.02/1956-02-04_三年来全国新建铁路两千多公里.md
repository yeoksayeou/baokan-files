Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: By the end of last year, construction departments of the Ministry of Railways had successively handed over approximately two thousand kilometers of newly built railways for formal transportation operations and temporary business.

The commissioning of new railways has powerfully supported the country's economic construction and the agricultural cooperative movement. The section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway already in transport operation transported tens of thousands of tons of double-wheeled double-shared plows, walking plows, seeders, harvesters, tractors, and chemical fertilizers through Lanzhou Station in the first half of last year alone, supporting agricultural production. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway transported more than 10,000 tons of mechanical equipment and chemical industry products to stations between Mianyang and Guangyuan in the first half of last year. Due to the opening of the railway, the price of coal in the Mianyang area was reduced by half, significantly reducing the cost of iron farm tools. In the past, farmers could only exchange 100 jin of chemical fertilizer for more than 300 jin of rice, but as soon as the railway opened, they could exchange it for more than 120 jin.

The country has already completed the construction of nearly 2,700 kilometers of new railways in the three years from 1953 to 1955. Therefore, of the 4,084 kilometers of new railways planned to be built within 5 years under the state's First Five-Year Plan, only more than 1,400 kilometers remain. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway can have its tracks laid to Yumen more than a year ahead of schedule this year. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway can be completed and opened to traffic ahead of schedule this year.

    三年来全国新建铁路两千多公里
    据新华社3日讯　到去年底，铁道部新建铁路施工部门先后交付正式运输营业和办理临时营业的新铁路已经有两千公里左右。
    新铁路交付营业，有力地支援了国家经济建设和农业合作化运动。兰新铁路已经办理运输营业的一段，仅在去年上半年就经由兰州站运输了上万吨的双轮双铧犁、步犁、播种机、收割机、拖拉机和化学肥料，支援农业生产。宝成铁路，去年上半年运到绵阳、广元间各站的机械器材和化学工业产品也有一万多吨。由于通了火车，绵阳地区的煤价降低了一半，使铁制农具的成本显著降低。从前农民用300多斤米才换到100斤化学肥料，刚一通火车就换到120斤以上。
    全国从1953年到1955年3年中已经完成了近2，700公里新铁路的建设任务。因此，国家第一个五年计划规定5年内修建的4，084公里的新铁路，只剩下1，400多公里了。兰新铁路可以提前一年多在今年铺轨到玉门。宝成铁路今年就可提前完成全线通车。
