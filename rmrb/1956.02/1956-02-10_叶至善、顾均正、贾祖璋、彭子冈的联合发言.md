Chairman, fellow committee members, fellow comrades:

We fully agree with Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and the four supplementary reports by other leaders. We are editors and also youth workers, working at the China Youth Publishing House under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. We would like to report to you on the needs of youth publications and make requests to the respected writers, experts, and comrades working in various positions.

Chairman Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report that "by the end of December 1955, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide had increased to more than 1.9 million, with over 70 million households joining, accounting for more than 60% of the total number of households in the country." The high tide of the national agricultural cooperation movement has arrived, and a high tide of rural culture will inevitably follow. The demand for popular reading materials in the vast countryside is becoming more urgent and higher day by day. Agricultural production cooperatives in various provinces are preparing to establish rural libraries. Shanxi Province alone plans to establish 32,000 rural libraries, initially requesting a supply of 20,000 sets of popular reading materials, each set containing 200 books, totaling 4 million books. To supply cultural nourishment to farmers, more than 27,000 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives across the country will sell books and periodicals, estimating a need for over 20 million copies of popular reading materials. Recently, Xinhua Bookstore requested that publishers supply a large number of popular reading materials before and after the Spring Festival. For China Youth Publishing House alone, the request was to supply 8.3 million copies before the Spring Festival and another 7.26 million copies from after the Spring Festival to the end of February. Such a large supply is truly unprecedented in the history of publishing in our country.

It is estimated that there are currently more than 30 million rural youth who have emerged from illiteracy. The leadership has long urged us to quickly publish more and better popular reading materials for rural youth. Rural youth are also increasingly urgently making such requests to us. With the organization of cooperatives, they demand reading materials that introduce the experience of running cooperatives. They hold various positions in the cooperatives, so they demand reading materials to guide their work. They are also eager to improve their political understanding, learn culture, learn scientific knowledge, and learn production technology. In all these areas, there must be a large number of popular reading materials to meet their needs. This task is arduous, but it makes us very excited. We are willing to do everything in our power to accomplish this task. At the same time, we request the respected writers, experts, and comrades working in various positions to give us more assistance and write more books for rural youth.

Rural youth are very strict in their selection of reading materials. They not only demand that they can understand what they read, but also that it has flavor; not only that it has flavor, but also that it is useful. To meet their requirements is not a very difficult task for the respected writers, experts, and comrades working in various positions. We know that most writers live in rural areas, and experts and working comrades often go to the countryside to solve various specific problems. Everyone is very clear about the situation in the countryside today. Everyone understands how rural youth live, what their thoughts and feelings are, what they like, what they need, and what their political and cultural level is. Therefore, we believe that as long as everyone is willing to write books for rural youth, they will definitely be able to write many good books that they can understand, like to read, and find useful.

Chairman Zhou Enlai also pointed out in his report that "the current strength of intellectuals in our country, whether in terms of quantity, professional level, or political awareness, is still not adapted to the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction." Therefore, it is necessary to "take a series of effective measures to most fully mobilize and utilize the strength of existing intellectuals," and at the same time, "massively cultivate new forces to expand their ranks to meet the country's growing demand for intellectuals." Vice Chairman Guo Moruo also pointed out in his report that "more active steps and more effective methods must be taken to expand the ranks of intellectuals." Youth in factories, troops, government offices, and schools have responded to the call to "march toward science." They have set off a high tide of learning, striving to make their political awareness, professional skills, and cultural and scientific level adapted to the needs of national construction and development. Graduates of senior primary schools and junior middle schools who have not gone on to higher education also demand to continue learning politics and learning culture and science. Publishing intermediate-level popular reading materials for the vast number of young people to help them learn is also one of the main tasks of the China Youth Publishing House. We also request writers, experts, and comrades working in various positions to give us more help. We believe that with your strong support, the China Youth Publishing House will be able to publish more and better popular reading materials for the youth of the country, especially rural youth, year after year.

    叶至善、顾均正、贾祖璋、彭子冈的联合发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我们完全同意周恩来主席的政治报告和其他首长的四个补充报告。我们是编辑工作者，也是青年工作者，在文化部和团中央领导的中国青年出版社工作。我们想就青年读物的要求方面，向各位报告一些情况；同时对敬爱的作家、专家和在各个岗位上做具体工作的同志，提出我们的请求。
    周恩来主席的报告中指出，“到1955年12月底为止，全国农业生产合作社已经增加到190多万个，入社农户达到7，000多万户，已经占全国农户总数的60％以上。”全国农业合作化运动的高潮已经来到了，农村文化的高潮必然地跟着就要出现。广大农村对于通俗读物的要求已经一天比一天迫切，一天比一天高涨。现在各省的农业生产合作社都准备成立农村图书室。其中山西一省，就要成立农村图书室32，000个，初步要求供应通俗读物2万套，每套200册，总数是400万册。为了向农民供应文化食粮，全国农村的27，000多个基层供销合作社将要经售书刊，估计需要通俗读物2，000万册以上。最近新华书店要求各出版社在春节前后供应大量通俗读物，单就中国青年出版社来说，要求在春节以前供应830万册，春节后到2月底止，再供应726万册。这样大的供应量，真是我国出版史上从来没有过的。
    农村青年已经脱离文盲状态的，目前估计有3，000多万。领导上早就督促我们，必须赶快为农村青年出版更多更好的通俗读物。农村青年也愈来愈迫切地向我们提出这样的要求。合作社组织起来了，他们要求有读物给他们介绍办社的经验。他们在合作社里担任了各种职务，因此要求有读物来指导他们工作。他们还迫切地要求提高政治认识，要求学习文化，学习科学知识，学习生产技术，无论哪一方面，都必须有大量的通俗读物来满足他们的要求。这个任务是艰巨的，但是使我们非常兴奋。我们愿意尽一切力量来完成这个任务。同时请求敬爱的作家、专家和在各个岗位上做具体工作的同志，多多给我们协助，多多为农村青年写书。
    农村青年对读物的选择是很严格的。他们不但要求读了能懂，还要求有味道；不但要求有味道，还要求有用处。要满足他们的要求，对敬爱的作家、专家和各个岗位上做具体工作的同志来说，并不是件十分困难的事。我们知道，大多数作家都常住在农村里，各位专家和工作同志为了解决各种具体问题，也经常要下乡。今天农村里的情况，大家都很清楚。农村青年在怎样生活，他们的思想感情是怎样的，他们爱好什么，需要什么，他们的政治文化水平怎样，大家都很了解。所以我们相信，只要大家肯为农村青年写书，一定能够写出许多他们读得懂，喜欢读，并且读了有用的好书来。
    周恩来主席的报告中还指出：“我国知识分子的现有力量，无论在数量方面、在业务水平方面、在政治觉悟方面，都还不能适应社会主义事业急速发展的需要”。因此要“采取一系列有效的措施，最充分地动员和发挥现有知识分子的力量”，同时还要“大规模地培养新生力量来扩大他们的队伍，以适应国家对于知识分子的不断增长的要求。”郭沫若副主席的报告中也指出：“必须采取更积极的步骤和更有效的方法来扩大知识分子的队伍。”工厂、部队、机关和学校里的青年都响应了“向科学进军”的号召。他们掀起了学习的高潮，努力要求自己的政治认识、业务技术和文化科学水平能适应国家建设发展的需要。没有升学的高小毕业生和初中毕业生也都要求继续学习政治，学习文化科学。为广大的青年出版中级通俗读物，帮助他们学习，也是中国青年出版社的主要任务之一。我们同样地请求作家、专家和在各个岗位上做具体工作的同志多多给我们帮助。我们相信，在你们的大力支援下，中国青年出版社一定能一年比一年为全国青年、尤其是农村青年，出版更多更好的通俗读物。
