To produce automobiles ahead of schedule, the employees of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are actively engaged in a labor competition. More than 90% of the plant's employees are now participating in the competition.

Workshops, departments, and trades are issuing challenges to each other. The gearbox workshop challenged 13 basic production workshops in the plant, guaranteeing to complete the tasks stipulated in the Five-Year Plan nine months ahead of schedule. The vast majority of engineering and technical personnel and administrative management personnel have also joined the competition.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 10th: Workers at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are continuously breaking quotas in socialist competition.

Li Guangda's team in the non-ferrous casting workshop improved the steelmaking method, and now the time for smelting a furnace of steel has been shortened to 3 hours and 5 minutes, which is 40 minutes less than before. In late January, Pan Wenrong, a fitter in the tool workshop, created a kind of blanking scissors, and the production of samples increased by 42.5 times compared with the quota. Zhou Kongzhao and Jiu Huan, technicians at the Metallurgical Department's laboratory, recently improved the analysis method of kerosene cracking gas in the gas carburizing furnace of the heat treatment workshop after more than 20 repeated experiments, which improved efficiency, and the time for one analysis was shortened from one and a half hours to 45 minutes.
