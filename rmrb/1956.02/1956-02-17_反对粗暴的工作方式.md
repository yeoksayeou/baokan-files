Oppose Brutal Working Methods

The leaders of the Heshan Coal Mine in Guangxi Province treat workers who are late for meetings and study sessions with punitive measures. When workers are a few minutes late for meetings and study sessions, the leaders make them stand aside without asking the reason, and only ask about the reason after the meeting. In Shaanxi Province, some factories and mines also force workers to participate in mass activities. Some factories stipulate that if workers are a few minutes late for meetings, they will be made to stand for a few minutes as punishment. Some coal mines stipulate that if workers are 10 minutes late for study sessions, they will not be allowed to go down the mine.

This brutal working method is obviously wrong. The masses are willing to attend meetings and are willing to study. However, they are only willing to participate in meetings that are substantial and can solve problems, and are only willing to participate in study activities that can truly improve themselves and other interesting extracurricular activities. We should enlighten and educate the masses to voluntarily participate in extracurricular activities, rather than forcing them to participate. We should help those who force the masses to attend meetings and study sessions to recognize the shortcomings in their work, and promote them to make all extracurricular activities truly interesting and substantial, so that they can attract the masses to participate voluntarily.

    反对粗暴的工作方式
    广西合山煤矿的领导人员，用惩罚的办法对待开会和学习迟到的工人。开会和学习的时候，工人迟到几分钟，领导人员就不问情由，让他站在一边，会后才问原因。陕西省也有些厂矿强迫工人参加群众活动。有的厂规定开会迟到几分钟，就罚站几分钟。有的煤矿规定学习迟到10分钟，就不准下井。
    这种粗暴的工作方式显然是错误的。群众是愿意开会，愿意学习的。但是，他们只愿意参加内容充实、能解决问题的会，只愿意参加真正能够提高自己的学习活动和有兴趣的其它业余活动。我们应该启发教育群众自愿参加业余活动而不应当强迫参加，应当帮助那些强迫群众开会和学习的人认识自己工作的缺点，推动他们把所有的业余活动办得真正有趣味、有内容，能够吸引群众自动参加。
