    Organize Inter-Factory Technical Cooperation and Exchange Advanced Experiences
    Luo Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry
    In January of this year, under the leadership of the Ministry of Local Industries, six local state-owned knitted underwear factories from three provinces in Northeast China held a technical experience exchange meeting in Lüda City. This meeting, in the form of inter-factory technical cooperation, exchanged experiences, which played a significant role in overcoming the shortcomings of low product quality, high costs, large waste, and few varieties that existed in various factories in Northeast China. According to the statistics of the six local state-owned knitted underwear factories that participated in the meeting, it is estimated that after the implementation of the nine technical experiences exchanged at the meeting, the first-class rate of绒衣裤 (flannelette/fleece shirts and trousers) will increase from about 52% last year to 84% this year, and the春秋衣裤 (spring and autumn shirts and trousers) will also increase from 60% to 87.8%. The annual savings in cotton yarn and fabric can reach 243,000 kilograms, and the total value of savings will account for 10% of the total cost.
    The knitted underwear industry in Northeast China is a new industry. Before 1952, there was only one knitting factory in the entire region. In recent years, with the growth of people's living needs, the number of factories has increased to six, and the total output value has also increased three times. For these reasons, some factory leaders have become complacent with the status quo, excessively emphasizing the small size of their factories and the lack of technical and management personnel, and are unwilling to actively and comprehensively learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other fraternal factories. Therefore, the product quality of various factories has been poor for a long time. In terms of product specifications, some 绒衣 (flannelette/fleece shirts) and 春秋衣 (spring and autumn shirts) have short sleeves, long bodies, large crotches, and short trouser legs. The dyed colors are not bright and not durable. In weaving and sewing, there are also defects such as broken fabric holes, reverse ribs, missed stitches, and pinhole breaks. The waste between various processes is relatively large, and the cost of products is also very high. Taking the open-front 绒衣 (flannelette/fleece shirt) produced by Liaoning Knitting Factory No. 2 as an example, excluding the difference in cotton yarn prices, it is 5.05% higher than that of Tianjin Knitting Factory.
    In order to change these situations in the knitted underwear industry in Northeast China, in the fourth quarter of last year, under the leadership of the Ministry of Local Industries, a group of technicians were transferred from various factories and concentrated in Yingkou, Lüda, and Songjiang knitting factories according to their specialties to test and promote the advanced knitting experience of North China. After two months of promotion pilot projects and demonstration performances, the technical experience exchange meeting was held in Lüda City from January 3 to 10. Through this meeting, first, experiences were exchanged. The six knitted underwear factories that participated in the experience exchange had little contact with each other in the past. Some technical problems that had been solved in one factory were still being studied in another factory, which was struggling to find a solution. This meeting conducted pilot studies and held discussions, which brought together the experiences of various factories, brought into play the collective strength, and solved the common problems of various factories in a relatively short period of time, strengthened the relationship between the factories, and achieved the goal of common improvement. For example, Liaoning Knitting Factory No. 2 installed a serger baffle on the serger in the sewing workshop, which reduced the scraps (loss) from 3.5% to about 1%. This experience has been promoted for more than eight months, but other factories did not know about this experience and were still studying and trying to find a solution. This exchange meeting shared this experience. Another example is the vulcanized blue flannel fabric dyed by Liaoning Knitting Factory No. 2. Due to the poor dyeing method, the quality of about 5% of the fabric was poor on average. Last year, the factory treated this problem as a key issue, but it could not be solved due to insufficient technical strength. At this technical experience exchange meeting, it was learned that Songjiang Knitting Factory had overcome this shortcoming as early as 1954.
    Second, the technical level was improved, and the quality problems that were common in various factories were solved. For example, weaving defects were a common and serious problem in various factories in Northeast China. Because of the poor installation of the cotton毛机 (cotton interlock machine) in Liaoning Knitting Factory No. 2, there were many defects in the cotton毛布 (cotton interlock fabric). In the spot check of 12 pieces of cotton毛布 (cotton interlock fabric) before the pilot project, the average number of missed stitches and broken holes was about 30, and the serious ones reached as many as 219; the average number of horizontal stripe fabrics was also about 18, and the most was 143; the total average per piece of fabric was 49.32, which was 2.6 times that of North China factories (average 18.62). Due to the serious defects and many accidents, factories had to increase repair workers and machine repair workers, and the workers' ability to manage the machines was also reduced. After learning the North China cotton毛机 (cotton interlock machine) machine operating regulations, these problems have been basically overcome. The 37 pieces of fabric woven by the 4 cotton毛机 (cotton interlock machine) machines installed in the pilot project had a total of only 93 defects, which was only one-tenth of the past. According to preliminary calculations, if it is widely promoted in the six factories in Northeast China, it can save 69,850 yuan per year. In terms of dyeing and finishing, sewing and other processes, the technical level has also been improved.
    Third, the meeting can also improve ideological understanding and overcome conservative thinking and complacency. Several old technicians reviewed their conservative thinking in mutual assistance and mutual learning. At the beginning of the pilot project, an old technician in the "Tompkin" group believed that the experience in North China "is nothing special," and "it was all passed down by one master." After the pilot project, he believed that the experience in North China was indeed advanced and understood the truth of "live and learn." After learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the comrades in the sewing group felt that this time "the completion of the task is guaranteed." Many technicians in the dyeing and finishing group wrote letters back to the factory during the pilot project and requested production according to the improved formula in the pilot project. Some comrades in the Tompkin group reflected: "The days of the pilot project are not many, but it has already caught up with learning for two years as an apprentice." The leaders of some factories also reviewed the shortcomings of simply adhering to some inappropriate systems and rules and neglecting inter-factory technical cooperation in the past. In this way, a wave of learning advanced experience and mastering new technologies has been preliminarily formed in various factories.

    组织厂际技术合作，交流先进经验
    辽宁省工业厅副厅长　罗剑华
    今年1月，在地方工业部的领导下，东北地区3个省的6个地方国营针织内衣工厂在旅大市举行了一次技术经验交流会议。这次会议，以厂际技术合作的形式，交流了经验，对于克服东北各厂所存在的产品质量低，成本高、浪费大和品种少等缺点有很大的作用。根据参加会议的6个地方国营针织内衣厂的统计，预计推行了会议中交流的9项技术经验以后，在今年内，绒衣裤的一等品将会由去年的52％左右提高到84％，春秋衣裤也将由60％提高到87.8％，全年可以节约的棉纱和布料量可达243，000公斤，节约总值将可以占到总成本的10％。
    针织内衣业在东北是一门新兴的工业。1952年以前，全区只有1个针织工厂。这几年，随着人民生活需要的增长，厂数已经增加到6个，生产总值也增加了3倍。由于这些原因，一些厂的领导干部便满足现状，过分强调自己厂子小，技术和管理力量不足，不肯积极地、全面地学习苏联和各兄弟工厂的先进经验。所以，各厂的产品质量长久以来都很低劣。在产品规格方面，有些绒衣和春秋衣的袖子短，身子长，裤裆大，裤腿短。漂染的色泽不鲜艳，不牢固。在织布方面和缝纫方面也都分别存在着坏布洞眼、反罗纹、漏针和针眼破洞等等缺点。各工序间的浪费现象较大，产品的成本也很高，以辽宁针织二厂所出的开襟绒衣为例，扣除棉纱差价外，比天津针织厂要高出5.05％。
    为了改变东北地区针织内衣业中的这些情况，去年第四季度，在地方工业部的领导下，从各厂抽调了一部分技术人员，按照专业分别集中在营口、旅大和松江3个针织厂，试验推广华北地区的针织先进经验。经过两个月的推广试点、示范表演之后，又于1月3—10日在旅大市召开了这次技术经验交流会议。通过这个会议，第一，交流了经验。这次参加交流经验的6个针织内衣工厂，过去相互联系少，有些技术问题，在这一个厂里早已解决，但是在另一个厂里，还在埋头研究，苦于找不到窍门。这次会议，进行了试点研究，又进行了会议讨论，这样，就汇集了各厂的经验，发挥了集体的力量，在较短的时间内解决了各厂普遍存在的问题，密切了各厂的关系，达到了共同提高的目的。例如辽宁针织二厂，在缝纫车间的拷克机上装置拷克挡板，使拷下的边子（损耗）由3.5％降到1％左右。这一经验已推广了8个多月，其它各厂都不知道这个经验，还在埋头钻研想办法。这一次交流会才交流了这一经验。又如辽宁针织二厂染的硫化青绒布，由于染色的方法不好，平均有5％左右的布的质量不好。去年这个厂曾把这个问题作为关键问题来处理，但是，因为技术力量不足而解决不了。在这一次技术经验交流会上，才知道松江针织厂早在1954年就克服了这个缺点。
    第二，提高了技术水平，解决了各厂所普遍存在的质量问题。例如，织布的疵病曾是东北各厂中普遍而严重存在的一个问题。辽宁针织二厂因为棉毛机安装的不良，棉毛布疵病很多。在试点前抽查的12匹棉毛布中，漏针破洞的疵病平均都在30个左右，严重的则达219个之多；横条布平均也在18个左右，最多的则达143个；总平均每匹布为49.32个，为华北各厂（平均18.62个）的二点六倍。由于疵病严重和事故多，各厂不得不增加修布工人和机修工人，工人的看台能力也降低。这一次学习了华北区棉毛机机器使用规程后，已经基本上克服了这些毛病。在试点中安装的4台棉毛机所织出的37匹布，总共才出了93个病疵，仅为过去的十分之一。据初步计算，如果在东北6个工厂中普遍推广以后，每年可以节约达69，850元。在染整、缝纫等工序方面，技术水平也有提高。
    第三，通过会议还可以提高思想认识，克服保守思想和骄傲自满情绪。有几位老的技术人员在互助互学中，都检讨了自己的保守思想。在起初进行试点的时候，“汤姆金”组曾有一位老技术人员认为华北地区的经验“没有啥”，“都是一个师傅传下来的”。经过试点以后，他认为华北的经验的确是先进的，懂得了“干到老、学到老”的道理。缝纫组的同志在学习了苏联的先进经验以后，觉得这回“完成任务有保证了”。漂染组许多技术员还在试点中就写信回厂要求根据试点中改进的配方进行生产。汤姆金组有的同志反映：“试点的日子不多，可是已经赶上学二年徒了”。一些工厂的领导人员，也检查了过去单纯拘泥于某些不合适的制度、规则和忽视厂际技术合作等缺点。这样，在各厂就初步形成了学习先进经验和掌握新技术的热潮。
