    Xinhua News Agency, 25th. The spring afforestation campaign in the southern provinces is expanding in scale. So far, according to preliminary statistics from eight provinces including Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guizhou, more than 2 million mu have been afforested, and more than 10 million trees have been planted sporadically. In Guangxi Province, the afforestation area in more than 40 counties in the Pingluo, Rongxian, Guilin, Yishan and other regions in the past week is more than the total afforestation area of the entire province last year. In Liexi Township, Guzhang County, Hunan Province, the two-year forestry task of greening the entire township was completed in three days. Zhejiang Province will start a greening movement month of the Party, government, military, and people from today, and Sichuan Province's along the Yangtze River region has also started the Yangtze River Greening Week campaign.
    The trees planted in the southern provinces are primarily timber forests, special economic forests, and water conservation forests, which are of great economic significance.
    This year's spring afforestation campaign in the southern provinces is being carried out in an organized, prepared, and planned manner. The agricultural and forestry departments and agricultural and forestry production cooperatives in each province, under the leadership of the local CCP committees, have formulated or revised greening plans based on the different natural conditions and the requirement in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) to green all barren hills and wastelands in 12 years. In order to give play to the positive leading role of young people, women's federations, Communist Youth League committees, and forestry departments in many provinces such as Guangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Sichuan have jointly convened conferences of young activists to organize and mobilize them for the task of greening the motherland. In order to strengthen the organization and leadership of the spring afforestation, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Forestry has also organized 9 groups to go to various regions to supervise and inspect. In addition, the provinces have generally trained forestry technicians before the start of the movement, and at the same time collected a large number of tree seeds to meet the needs of afforestation and seedling cultivation.

    南方各省展开大规模春季造林运动
    新华社25日讯　南方各省的春季造林运动规模越来越大。到目前为止，根据广东、广西、浙江、安徽、四川、湖南、湖北、贵州等8个省的初步统计，已经造林200多万亩，零星植树1，000多万株。广西省平乐、容县、桂林、宜山等专区的40多个县最近一个星期的造林面积，比去年全省的造林总面积还多。湖南省古丈县列溪乡在三天内完成了绿化全乡的两年营林任务。浙江省从今天起开始党、政、军、民的绿化运动月，四川省沿江地区也开始了长江绿化周运动。
    南方各省营造的林木都是用材林、特种经济林和水源林，经济意义很大。
    今年南方各省的春季造林运动，是有组织有准备、有计划地开展起来的。各省的农、林部门和农业、农林业生产合作社，都在当地中共党委的领导下，根据不同的自然条件和全国农业发展纲要（草案）中12年绿化一切荒山荒地的要求，制订或修订了绿化规划。为了发挥青年的积极带头作用，广西、浙江、湖南、四川等许多省的妇联、青年团委和林业部门都先后联合召开了青年积极分子大会，对绿化祖国的任务进行了组织动员。浙江省林业厅为加强对春季造林的组织领导，还组织了9个小组到各专区进行督促检查。此外，各省在运动开始前普遍训练林业技术员，同时大量采集树种，以满足造林育苗的需要。
