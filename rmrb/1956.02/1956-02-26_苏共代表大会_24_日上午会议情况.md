Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch from TASS: The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union continued its session on the morning of February 24th. The meeting concluded the discussion of the report on the directives for the Sixth Five-Year Plan made by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, to this Congress, and also passed some resolutions.

In the past four days, a total of 34 people spoke during the discussion of Bulganin's report. The representatives who spoke at the morning session on the 24th were: Rajabov from Azerbaijan, Kamalov from Uzbekistan, Kovrigina from Moscow, Minister of Tractor and Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing of the USSR Khlamov, Minister of State Farms Benediktov, Minister of Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Lomako, Minister of Petroleum Industry Yevseyenko, and Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences and non-Party member Lysenko. In their speeches, they unanimously supported Bulganin's report and made some supplementary suggestions to the draft directives.

After the representatives spoke, the chairman of the meeting, Pervukhin, announced that the presidium had received a proposal to end the discussion. Subsequently, the meeting accepted this proposal.

Pervukhin then announced that Comrade Bulganin did not intend to make a concluding speech on the discussion because the comrades who spoke agreed with the basic content of his report and the draft directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan put forward by the Central Committee of the Party.

Subsequently, the Congress unanimously adopted the resolution on Bulganin's report:

	1. Approve the draft directives of the 20th Congress of the CPSU on the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union as a basis proposed by the Central Committee of the CPSU.
	2. Elect a Congress committee to review the proposed amendments and supplements to the draft directives.

Subsequently, the Congress determined the members of this review committee.

The meeting also unanimously adopted a detailed resolution on the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, drafted by a committee chaired by Khrushchev. The Congress also passed a resolution to make partial amendments to the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Then representatives of fraternal parties delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress. They were warmly welcomed by all those present.

The representative of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, Groot, said that after the Geneva Conference, the broad strata of people in our country increasingly believe in the lofty goals of the international policy of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp. At the same time, more and more Dutch people are beginning to realize the need to cooperate with the Soviet Union and establish a European collective security system, which will be able to prevent threats to our independence. We are fully convinced that the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU will further promote peaceful coexistence and cooperation among countries, and will open up new prospects in this regard.

The representative of the Communist Party of Luxembourg, Urbany, said: Our people are increasingly clear that the victory of the Soviet people and its consistent peaceful foreign policy are also the most solid guarantee for the continued survival and free development of our small country.

The representative of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, Buck, said that the achievements of the Soviet people illuminate the path for all mankind towards peace and social progress. The Congress's directives on the Sixth Five-Year Plan have inspired the peace-loving people in capitalist countries. The democratic forces in capitalist countries believe that this directive is an example of people using their country's resources to create a prosperous and cultured life.

The representative of the Moroccan Communist Party, Ali Yata, expressed the feelings of friendship of the Moroccan people towards the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. He went on to say that Morocco hopes to establish relations with peace-loving countries, especially with the Soviet Union, on the basis of friendship, mutual respect for independence, and mutually beneficial economic and cultural cooperation.

Hill, representing the Communist Party of Australia, delivered a congratulatory message saying that the Soviet Union's peace initiatives have aroused great interest among the Australian people. Australia's interests require the establishment of friendly relations and a collective security treaty between the countries of Asia and the Pacific region, a proposal already put forward by the People's Republic of China in July 1955.

The representative of the Icelandic United Socialist Party, Bjarnason, said in his congratulatory message that the Icelandic people are watching with great interest the rapid development of the Soviet economy and the improvement of the welfare of the Soviet people. We know that the new Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union not only guarantees the further improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people but also creates new possibilities for the peaceful coexistence of all other nations.

The representative of the Tunisian Communist Party, Ennafaa, read out the Tunisian Communist Party's congratulatory message to the Congress.

At the Congress, congratulatory messages from the People's Vanguard Party of Costa Rica, the Guatemalan Labor Party, and the Communist Parties of Bolivia, Paraguay, Greece, Ecuador, and Trieste were also read out.

Finally, the chairman of the meeting, Pervukhin, said at the meeting that at this Congress, representatives of many countries' communist and workers' parties have delivered congratulatory messages. In addition, the Congress has also received many congratulatory letters from foreign communist organizations, trade union organizations, and other social organizations, as well as many congratulatory messages from organizations and social groups of the Soviet working people. Pervukhin expressed his deep gratitude on behalf of the 20th Congress and, on behalf of this Congress, assured all guests and all those who cherish the cause of the working class, peace, and the progress of all mankind that the Soviet Communists will do their utmost to gloriously fulfill the tasks put forward by the Party Congress and will spare no effort to consolidate world peace.

The meeting adjourned.
