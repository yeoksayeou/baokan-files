Chairman, fellow committee members, comrades!

	Before I begin, I would like to express my complete agreement with and sincere support for the six reports made to the conference by Chairman Zhou Enlai and the other five comrades.

	Our CPPCC Second National Committee's Second Session is being held in a situation where the socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, and the people of the whole country, with joyful and excited hearts, are entering socialist society one region after another. What we formerly dreamed of is now gradually becoming a directly perceptible reality, and our excitement and gratitude are entirely understandable. I deeply realize that without the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, such a rapid victory would have been unimaginable. Our idea of building a socialist society through peaceful transformation has creatively developed new factors in Marxist-Leninist principles. These factors will play an important guiding role in the liberation struggles of the world's proletariat and colonized peoples.

	Now, I would like to briefly express my personal opinions on the following points:

	First, the victorious development of our socialist cause will inevitably further strengthen the power of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and will be more conducive to easing international tensions and safeguarding the peaceful labor of the people of the world. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different systems that we advocate, and the proposition of resolving all international disputes through peaceful consultation, have been increasingly supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. Especially since the Asian-African Conference, the universal opposition to war and colonialism has become an irresistible force, causing the "position of strength" policy to fail, and international tensions have been somewhat eased and consolidated by the "Geneva spirit." However, the imperialist aggressive bloc regards peace as a disaster. According to them, it seems that the world would not be the world without tensions, colonial enslavement, and capitalist exploitation. Dulles of the United States clamors for a "brink of war" intimidation policy, which is to create new tensions and provoke an arms race, plunging the vast majority of people into poverty and bankruptcy for the sake of the excessive profits of a few monopoly capitalists. We must further expose all the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive bloc, raise the vigilance of the peace-loving people, and make unremitting efforts to continue to ease international tensions.

	Second, the arrival of the high tide of socialist transformation in our country is a lawful arrival based on mass practice. However, when the high tide arrived, it was so unexpected. Inevitably following the high tide of socialist transformation is a high tide of production, and other high tides in economic and cultural undertakings will certainly arrive. How can we avoid being dizzy with victory in the face of these surging high tides? I would like to use Chairman Mao's words to explain this issue. He said: "People's thinking must adapt to the changed situation. Of course, no one can engage in unfounded speculation, or plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, or force themselves to do things that are really impossible. But the current problem is that right-leaning conservative thinking is causing trouble in many areas, making the work in many areas unable to adapt to the development of objective circumstances. The current problem is that there are many people who believe that things that could have been done with effort cannot be done. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to constantly criticize the right-leaning conservative ideas that do exist." Only by strengthening the study of Marxist theory, effectively transforming our thinking, and cultivating sensitivity to new things, so as to proceed from objective reality in a down-to-earth manner and look at problems from a developmental perspective, can we overcome conservative thinking and avoid being dizzy with victory.

	Chairman Mao instructed us to have a long-term plan to change our country's backwardness in economy, science, and culture, and rapidly reach the advanced levels in the world, and pointed out that "in order to achieve this great goal, the decisive factor is to have cadres, to have a sufficient number of excellent scientific and technical experts; at the same time, it is necessary to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, and unite all forces that can be united." Premier Zhou specially put forward a comprehensive planning policy on uniting and transforming intellectuals and improving the level of science and technology. This shows how much our intellectuals, especially scientific and technical experts, are valued and cared for by the Party and the state. Various intellectuals can only have such a broad and promising future by combining with workers and peasants and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. It also shows that the responsibilities of our intellectuals are becoming greater and greater. If we do not first overcome our own shortcomings, it will be difficult to shoulder this huge task. Our members of democratic parties are generally mostly intellectuals and have the glorious task of uniting, educating, and transforming the masses they are connected with in the united front. Only by first strengthening the study of Marxist-Leninist theory and national policies and laws, and thoroughly transforming our thinking, criticizing subjective conservative thinking, can we do a good job in our posts and drive the masses we are connected with to move forward together in the division of labor in the united front.

	Third, I would like to say a few words from the standpoint of a judicial worker: The state's legal system and laws are mainly determined by the economic base of a certain society, and serve to further consolidate this economic base. It reflects the interests of a certain class. The economic base that determines our country's legal system is mainly socialist ownership, and we affirm in the Constitution that public property is sacred and inviolable. Loving the socialist motherland and abiding by the socialist legal system are the basic contents of our patriotism and law-abiding today. Our socialist cause is developing victoriously, but the imperialist encirclement still exists, and Taiwan has not yet been liberated. All counter-revolutionaries, urban and rural illegal capitalists, and corrupt and thieving elements will never willingly give up and offer no resistance. We cannot imagine that it will be peaceful and uneventful without serious struggle. Our judicial workers must first raise their vigilance, criticize any idea of complacency and paralysis, thoroughly exert the active role of judicial work as one of the superstructures of the economic base, resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely fight against all illegal acts that resist socialist transformation, steal state public property, and undermine national economic construction, in order to protect and consolidate the victorious achievements of socialism.

	Fourth, regarding the issue of liberating Taiwan: Here, I mainly want to say a few words to the people who fled to Taiwan. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's sacred territory, and the people of Taiwan are an inseparable part of the Chinese people. The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair and brooks no interference from any external forces. The armed aggression by the American aggressive bloc has created tensions between China and the United States, seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world. This is unanimously condemned by all peace-loving countries and people. There is no doubt that aggressive forces will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the forces of peace. Sooner or later, Taiwan will be liberated. The people of the motherland are very concerned about the tragic situation of the compatriots in Taiwan. Premier Zhou Enlai especially pointed out two ways to liberate Taiwan, one of which is to liberate Taiwan peacefully, giving the people in Taiwan, especially the military and political personnel of the Kuomintang, a glorious opportunity to serve the motherland. All those who have fled to Taiwan must distinguish between internal affairs and diplomacy in the relationship between China and the United States, firmly stand on the position of loving the motherland, draw a clear line with the American aggressors, sever ties, and quickly return to the warm family of the motherland. Only in this way can you control your own destiny and strive for a bright future. The people of the motherland have always been concerned about and taken care of all those who dare to abandon the dark and turn to the light and correct their mistakes, without dwelling on the past. Now Premier Zhou has pointed out specific methods. If you don't believe it, anyone can come back and see for themselves. Isn't this a benevolent and exhaustive idea? All those who have fled to Taiwan! Is it better to be obsessed and become a traitor who is bound to fail and has no place to be buried? Or is it better to resolutely abandon the dark and turn to the light and return to the embrace of the motherland and become a new Chinese person who can hold their head high? Where to go is the time for you to make a decisive decision to be reborn.

	Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to work with all the committee members to step up our ideological understanding, strive to catch up with the ever-developing situation, closely rely on the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and, in the struggle to realize the general task of the country in the transition period ahead of schedule and against enemies at home and abroad, do our best to play the role that a member of a democratic party should play in the united front. To fight for the complete completion of the socialist cause.

	I wish the conference a victory and all the committee members good health.

    方鼎英的发言
    主席、各位委员、各位同志！
    在发言之先，我首先对周恩来主席等六位同志向大会所作的六个报告，表示完全同意并竭诚拥护。
    我们政协第二届第二次会议，是在社会主义改造取得了决定胜利、全国人民正以欢欣鼓舞的心情、一个地区紧接一个地区地开始走进社会主义社会的情况下召开的。从前所理想的将来，现在已经逐步地成为可以直接感觉到的现实，我们心情的兴奋和感激，是完全可以理解的。我深切地体会到：如果不是中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，这样迅速到来的胜利，将是不可想像的。我们通过和平改造建成社会主义社会的思想，在马克思列宁主义原理中，创造地发展了新的因素，这些因素对世界无产阶级和殖民地人民的解放斗争，将起着重要的指导意义。
    现在，我想简单地就下面几点表示我个人的意见：
    第一，我国社会主义事业的胜利发展，必然进一步加强以苏联为首的世界和平民主社会主义阵营的力量，而更有利于缓和国际紧张局势，维护全世界人民的和平劳动。我们所倡导的不同制度国家和平共处的五项原则，用和平协商解决国际间一切争端的主张，已越来越得到全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的普遍支持，特别自亚非会议以来，普遍反对战争、反对殖民主义已成为不可抗拒的力量，使“实力地位”政策遭到了破产，国际紧张局势有了某些缓和，并为“日内瓦精神”所巩固。可是，帝国主义侵略集团，却把和平看成灾难，据他们的说法，似乎世界上没有紧张局势，没有殖民奴役，没有资本剥削就会不成其为世界。美国的杜勒斯叫嚷着“战争边缘”的恐吓政策，就是要重新制造紧张局势，挑起军备竞赛，为少数垄断资本家的超额利润，把广大人民投入贫困破产的深渊。我们必须进一步揭露帝国主义侵略集团的一切阴谋，提高和平人民的警惕，为继续缓和国际紧张局势，作坚持不懈的斗争。
    第二，我国社会主义改造高潮的到来，是在群众实践的基础上合乎规律地到来的。可是，当高潮到来时，却如此地出乎我们意料之外，继社会主义改造高潮之后，必不可免的是生产高潮，以及其他经济事业文化事业的高潮也一定到来。我们如何能在这些风起云涌的高潮面前，不致为胜利吓昏头脑呢？我想用毛主席的话来说明这个问题。他说：“人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况。当然，任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。但是现在的问题，还是右倾保守思想在许多方面作怪，使许多方面的工作不能适应客观情况的发展。现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到。因此，不断地批判那些确实存在的右倾保守思想，就有完全的必要了。”我们只有加强马克思主义理论学习，切实改造思想，培养对新事物的敏感性，达到实事求是地从客观实际出发，从发展的观点看问题，才能克服保守思想，不致在胜利面前吓昏头脑。
    毛主席指示我们要有一个远大的规划，来改变我国在经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，迅速达到世界上的先进水平，并指出“为了实现这个伟大的目标，决定一切的是要有干部，要有数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家；同时，要继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量”。周总理特别提出了关于团结和改造知识分子，提高科学技术水平的全面规划方针。说明我们各种知识分子，特别是科学技术专家，是如何地受到党和国家的重视和关怀。各种知识分子也只有与工农结合，只有在中国共产党领导下，才有今天这样广阔发展的远大前途，也说明我们知识分子的责任越来越大，如果不首先克服本身存在的缺点，是很难担负起这桩巨大的任务的。我们民主党派成员，一般是知识分子占绝大多数，在统一战线中负有团结、教育和改造所联系的群众的光荣任务。我们只有首先加强马克思列宁主义理论和国家政策法令的学习，首先彻底改造思想，批判主观主义的保守思想，才能作好岗位工作，才能在统一战线分工中带动所联系的群众共同前进。
    第三，我想就我作为一个司法工作者的立场说几句话：国家的法制和法律，主要是由一定社会的经济基础所决定，并为进一步巩固这个经济基础而服务的，它表现着一定阶级的利益。决定我们国家法制的经济基础，主要是社会主义所有制，我们在宪法中肯定了公共财产神圣不可侵犯。爱社会主义祖国和守社会主义法制，是我们今天爱国守法的基本的内容。我国社会主义事业，正在胜利发展，但帝国主义包围还存在，台湾还没有解放，一切反革命分子、城乡不法资本家和贪污盗窃分子，决不会就此甘心情愿的毫无抵抗，决不能想像不经过严重的斗争就太平无事。我们司法工作者，必须首先提高警惕，批判任何太平麻痹思想，彻底发挥司法工作作为经济基础的上层建筑之一的能动作用，坚决镇压一切反革命分子，和一切抗拒社会主义改造、盗窃国家公共财产、破坏国家经济建设的非法行为作坚决的斗争，才能保护和巩固社会主义胜利的成果。
    第四，关于解放台湾的问题：在这里，主要是向逃往台湾的人们说几句话。台湾是中国神圣不可分割的领土，台湾人民是中国人民不可分离的一部分，解放台湾是中国的内政，决不容许任何外力的干涉。由于美国侵略集团的武装侵略，造成了中美两国之间的紧张局势，严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平。这是一切爱好和平的国家和人民所一致谴责的。侵略势力必然在和平力量面前遭到可耻的失败，是完全没有问题的。台湾迟早是一定要解放的。祖国人民对台湾同胞目前所处的悲惨景况，是十分关怀的。周恩来总理特别指出了解放台湾的两条途径，其中一条是用和平的方式解放台湾，给在台湾的人们、特别是国民党的军政人员一个报效祖国的光荣机会。凡属逃在台湾的人们，必须在中美两国的关系中，分清内政和外交的界限，坚决地站在爱护祖国的立场，和美国侵略分子划清界限，割断联系，迅速回到祖国温暖的大家庭来。只有这样，才能掌握你们自己的命运，争取光明的前途。祖国人民对一切勇于弃暗投明改正错误的人，素来是关怀照顾不究既往的，现在周总理又指出了具体的办法，如果你们不信，任何人都可以亲自回来看看，难道这还不是仁至义尽的设想吗？一切逃在台湾的人们！到底是执迷不悟，作一个一定失败的死无葬身之地的卖国罪人好呢？还是坚决弃暗投明回到祖国怀抱，作一个扬眉吐气的新中国人民好呢？何去何从，是你们起死回生当机立断的时候了。
    末了，我愿意通过这次大会，和各位委员一道，加紧提高思想认识，争取赶上不断发展的情况，紧紧依靠共产党和毛主席的领导，在提前实现国家在过渡时期的总任务和反对国内外敌人的斗争中，尽量发挥一个民主党派的成员在统一战线中所应起的作用。为彻底完成社会主义事业而斗争。
    谨祝大会胜利，诸位委员健康。
