    A Closely Contested Football Match
    Wei Kun
    In the capital, many international-level friendly matches with foreign football teams have already been held. Each time, football enthusiasts in the capital have watched these matches with the simple intention of appreciating the skills of the foreign teams. However, yesterday's match between the "Garbarnia" football team from Krakow, Polish People's Republic, and the Beijing Youth Football Team of China at the Xiannongtan Stadium brought a new feeling to football enthusiasts. In addition to admiring the excellent skills of the "Garbarnia" team, they also expressed appreciation for the outstanding skills of the Beijing Youth Team.

    Before the match, the Beijing Youth Team analyzed the "Garbarnia" team's strengths: experienced in international competitions, good physical fitness, and good speed, especially their final sprint towards the goal. The Beijing Youth Team made arrangements based on the characteristics of their own team and proposed a strategy of "full attack, tight defense."

    On the afternoon of the 19th, the audience braved the strong wind and crowded the stands around the Xiannongtan Stadium very early. At 2:30, the unforgettable game began. The lineup of the Polish "Garbarnia" football team was: Stroynialdz, Filius, Konopolski, Baumba, Lesniak, Pilnyak, Kukharski, Byatek, Brovarski, Bauzek, and Glaitzel. The lineup of the Beijing Youth Team was: Zhang Junxiu, Piao Wanfu, Xie Hongjun, Wang Kebin, Chen Chengda, Zhang Jingtian, Cong Ziyu, Zhang Honggen, Fang Renqiu, Nian Weisi, and Wang Lu.

    After the kick-off, the "Garbarnia" team launched three consecutive attacks, trying to overwhelm the opponent with a fierce offensive. They adopted the "cross-passing" tactic, attempting to create openings to create favorable situations for scoring. The five forwards shuttled back and forth in the Beijing Youth Team's territory, constantly interweaving, and the ball gradually approached the goal. At this time, the ball was at the feet of Kukharski on the right wing. He lobbed the ball into the penalty area, and right inside forward Byatek suddenly cut in, dribbling the ball a few steps, and shot fiercely a few meters from the goal. Just as the audience shouted "Goal!", the ball was caught by Zhang Junxiu, the goalkeeper of the Beijing Youth Team.

    The Beijing Youth Team broke through the encirclement and constantly pounced on the opponent's territory. "Garbarnia" team's center back Konopolski, with the cooperation of the defenders and midfielders, appeared very brave. He blocked left and right, preventing the opponent's forwards from succeeding. After 36 minutes, the Beijing Youth Team launched another offensive. The forwards took the ball into the penalty area, waiting for an opportunity to shoot. "Garbarnia" team's right midfielder Lesniak hurriedly returned to block, accidentally touching the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty of 11 meters. Chen Chengda of the Beijing Youth Team scored the penalty kick. After losing a point, the "Garbarnia" team tried to counterattack, but because the first half time was up, they did not succeed.

    In the 45 minutes of the second half, the audience's emotions did not calm down for a minute. After more than ten minutes of fierce fighting between the two teams, "Garbarnia" team forwards Byatek, Bauzek, and Glaitzel passed the ball back and forth outside the opponent's penalty area. Center forward Brovarski took advantage of the chaos in front of the goal to sneak into the center, get the ball, and shoot. The goalkeeper of the Beijing Youth Team hurriedly turned around to save, but the ball had already entered the net. The Beijing Youth Team immediately launched an attack from the left. Left winger Wang Lu crossed the ball from the sideline, center forward Fang Renqiu received the ball and passed it to the right front about 7 meters from the goal. Nian Weisi was waiting right there, and without waiting for the opponent to block, he immediately kicked the ball, which flew straight into the net. After the Beijing Youth Team won, their morale was greatly boosted, and they launched a series of offensives. The "Garbarnia" team calmly responded, firmly defending their position. After 20 minutes of stalemate, a tense situation appeared again in front of the "Garbarnia" team's goal. The Beijing Youth Team attacked the goal twice in a row, but were bravely blocked by the opponent's defenders. After the "Garbarnia" team seized the ball, they quickly advanced the ball into the opponent's territory, taking advantage of the opponent's lack of defensive manpower. The center forward and two inside forwards contained the opponent's defenders, and Glaitzel dribbled the ball from the sideline and cut in, catching the goalkeeper off guard with a long shot. The ball rushed into the net amidst applause. The score on the field was 2 to 2.

    At this time, there were only seven or eight minutes left until the end of the game, and "Who will win?" was the audience's most anxious question. In less than a minute, Chen Chengda, Nian Weisi, and Zhang Honggen of the Beijing Youth Team advanced with the ball. After several passes, they reached the front of the goal. Center forward Fang Renqiu gave the opponent a surprise close-range shot. The ball happened to hit the goalkeeper and bounced out. Fang Renqiu hurriedly kicked it again. The goalkeeper tried to turn around and save, but the ball had already been shot into the empty net. The score of 3 to 2 was maintained until the end of the game.

    The players of the "Garbarnia" football team are all first-class athletes in Poland. Among the 11 players who played today, 8 are members of the Polish national mixed football team. Some of them have already participated in 15 international competitions. After the Beijing Youth Football Team participated in the 5th World Youth Festival in Warsaw, Poland last August, they lost 2 to 3 to the "Garbarnia" football team in a friendly match during their visit to Krakow. After watching this friendly match, Yo. Mokelinski, the deputy leader of the "Garbarnia" football team, said: "The Beijing Youth Football Team has made progress in its technique compared to last year. Their attacking power has been strengthened, and their defense is also more tight." (Attached picture)

    一场势均力敌的足球赛
    韦琨
    在首都，已举行过许多次具有国际水平的国外足球队的访问比赛。每一次访问比赛，首都足球爱好者总是怀着一种单纯欣赏国外球队技术的心情去观看。可是，昨天在先农坛体育场举行的波兰人民共和国克拉科夫市“格尔巴尼亚”足球队和我国北京青年足球队的比赛，给足球爱好者带来一种新的感情。他们除了赞叹“格尔巴尼亚”队的技术卓越外，对北京青年队的优秀技术也同样地表示赞赏。
    比赛前，北京青年队分析了“格尔巴尼亚”队的情况：队员富有国际比赛经验，体力很好，速度也不错，特别是临门的冲刺十分厉害。北京青年队根据本队的特点作了部署，并提出“全力进攻、严密防守”的战略。
    19日下午，观众冒着大风很早就挤满了先农坛体育场四周看台。两点半钟，令人难忘的球赛开始了。波兰“格尔巴尼亚”足球队阵容是：斯特罗亚尼尔兹、费虑斯、柯诺波尔斯基、鲍姆拔、列斯尼亚克、弼因尼也克、库哈尔斯基、比亚特克、勃罗瓦尔斯基、鲍泽克、格拉依擦尔。北京青年队阵容是：张俊秀、朴万福、谢鸿钧、王克斌、陈成达、张京天、从者余、张宏根、方纫秋、年维泗、王陆。
    开球后，“格尔巴尼亚”队就连续发动三次进攻，想以猛烈的攻势压住对方。他们采用“交义传球”的战术，企图打出缺口，给攻门造成有利形势。5个前锋在北京青年队的阵地上一来一往，穿插不休，球渐渐向大门逼近。这时，球在右翼库哈尔斯基的脚下。他将球一挑传入禁区，右内锋比亚特克猛地切进，将球带上几步，在门前几公尺处猛射。观众才喊出“进了”，球已被北京青年队守门员张俊秀接住。
    北京青年队突破围困，不断向对方阵地猛扑。“格尔巴尼亚”队中卫柯诺波尔斯基，在后卫和前卫的配合下，显得十分勇猛。只见他左挡右拦，使对方前锋不能得逞。时间过了36分钟，北京青年队再度发动攻势，前锋将球带进禁区，待机射门。“格尔巴尼亚”队右前卫列斯尼亚克急忙赶回堵截，不慎手触球犯规，罚11公尺球。北京青年队陈成达罚球得分。“格尔巴尼亚”队失去一分后，力图反攻，但因上半场时间已到，没有建功。
    在下半场的45分钟比赛里，观众的情绪没有平静过一分钟。两队激战10几分钟后，“格尔巴尼亚”队前锋比亚特克、鲍泽克和格拉依擦尔三人在对方禁区外围来回传球，中锋勃罗瓦尔斯基乘门前混乱时窜入腹地，得球乘虚射门。北京青年队守门员急忙转身扑救，球已进入网内。北京青年队立刻从左边发动进攻。左翼王陆将球边线传中，中锋方纫秋接球拨到离门约7公尺的右前方，年维泗候个正着，不等对方阻截立刻举脚一蹴，球直飞进网内。北京青年队得胜后，士气大振，连连发动攻势。“格尔巴尼亚”队沉着应战，坚守阵地。相持20分钟后，“格尔巴尼亚”队门前又呈现紧张状态。北京青年队连攻两次大门，都被对方后卫奋勇挡出。“格尔巴尼亚”队夺住球后，乘对方后防人力不足，迅速将球推进对方阵地。中锋和两个内锋牵制住对方后卫，格拉依擦尔带球从边线切入，乘守门员防备不及来个远射，球在一片掌声中窜入网内。场上纪录2比2。
    这时离终场还有七、八分钟，“谁胜谁负”这是观众最焦急的问题。不到一分钟，北京青年队陈成达、年维泗、张宏根带球前进，经过几个传递，到了门前。中锋方纫秋给对方来个措手不及的近射，球恰好打在守门员身上弹出，方纫秋急忙又补踢一脚。守门员想转身抢救，球已射进空门。3比2的比分一直保持到终场。
    “格尔巴尼亚”足球队的队员都是波兰的一级运动员。他们今天出场的11名队员中，有8名是波兰国家足球混合队的队员。其中有的队员已经参加过15次国际比赛。北京青年足球队去年8月在波兰华沙参加了第五届世界青年联欢节以后，在访问克拉科夫市的一次友谊比赛中，曾经以2比3败给“格尔巴尼亚”足球队。“格尔巴尼亚”足球队副领队约·莫克尔净斯基在观看了这场友谊比赛以后说：“北京青年足球队的技术比去年有了进步，他们的进攻力量加强了，防守得也比较严密。”（附图片）
