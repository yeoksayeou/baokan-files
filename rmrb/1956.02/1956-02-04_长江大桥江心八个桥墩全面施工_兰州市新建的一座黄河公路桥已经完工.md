Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 3rd: On the afternoon of January 31st, construction workers on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge floated the last steel caisson from the manufacturing site to the pier site of the No. 6 bridge pier in the center of the Yangtze River, preparing for its sinking. With this, all eight bridge piers in the heart of the Yangtze River Bridge have entered full-scale construction.

Currently, construction workers at the bridge site are intensifying construction during the dry season of the Yangtze River. The No. 1 bridge pier, which started construction earliest, has completed the underwater sealing concrete and the filling of concrete inside the large tubular columns, and is preparing to continue pouring pier concrete upwards. Other piers are either about to pour underwater concrete, or are drilling rocks or inserting steel sheet pile cofferdams, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 3rd: A new Yellow River highway bridge in Lanzhou has been completed on January 30th. This bridge spans the Yellow River between Lanzhou's new industrial zone and the building materials production site. A large amount of building materials needed by construction units such as the Lanzhou Oil Refinery and the Petroleum Machinery Factory will be transported through this bridge.
