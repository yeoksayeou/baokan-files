    Make Dong Lai Shun's Mutton Hot Pot Even Better
    By our reporters Wang Huiping and Fan Rongkang

    Anyone who comes to Beijing wants to try Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot.

    Every year after the beginning of autumn, when the weather turns cold, Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot goes on sale. Three or five friends eat a meal, each chipping in eight jiao to one yuan, which is a fair price. "Old Beijingers" regard eating mutton hot pot at Dong Lai Shun after autumn as a kind of pleasant enjoyment. Grab a seat, set up a steaming hot pot, mix various seasonings such as chili oil, shrimp oil, sesame paste, and fermented bean curd, order a few plates of mutton at will, and eat slowly, it's very flavorful. Those who like fatty meat order a plate of "Da Sancha," the meat is white at one end and red at the other; those who like lean meat order a plate of "Huang Gua Tiao," the meat is all red; if you want to eat half fat and half lean, ordering a plate of "Xiao Sancha" is just right, and the meat color of "Xiao Sancha" is another way: red at both ends and white in the middle. Each plate of meat slices is neatly arranged, thinly sliced, rolled into a small roll, looks comfortable, and tastes fine and tender. Even people who never eat mutton can't help but say when they enter Dong Lai Shun: "This mutton is different, it doesn't have any muttony smell."

    Dong Lai Shun Restaurant's mutton hot pot has a history of more than 40 years in Beijing. Beijingers like it, outsiders like it, and international friends often come here admiring its reputation. On holidays, Dong Lai Shun cannot cope without 1,000 jin of mutton. At noon and in the evening, people waiting to eat mutton hot pot fill the aisles of Dong Lai Shun, and after waiting for half an hour for a seat, they still say: "It's not too crowded today."

    However, recently, Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot has not tasted good. The meat plates come up with the meat slices in clumps, and when put into the pot, they are not strips, but chunks, which are not easy to chew or swallow. The seasonings are also bad. The soy sauce is not sweet, the sesame paste sticks to the tongue, and the chili oil is sometimes replaced with chili powder mixed with plain water. The side dishes are also poor. The old sugar garlic was peeled by hand, and the fingers were sticky, as if沾沾 with a hand of honey, and the taste was fragrant and sweet; the current sugar garlic seems to be scooped up from the water tank, light and tasteless, both spicy and bitter. Customers have many opinions. Experienced old customers don't occupy seats first when they come in, but first ask: "Is the meat good today?" The waiters in the store clean the restaurant and see piles of unchewed meat scraps on the tables and floors, and they also feel uncomfortable.

    Why did Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot taste bad for a while?

    It's a long story. Whether mutton hot pot tastes good or not can really be regarded as a science. First, it depends on what kind of meat it is. Is it mutton or goat meat, fresh or frozen? Mutton is fine and delicious, while goat meat is coarse and not delicious. Fresh mutton is tender and delicious; frozen mutton is old and not delicious. Second, it depends on whether it is a big sheep or a small sheep. Small sheep weighing twenty or thirty jin have not yet grown plump meat, and it is tasteless to eat; large sheep weighing fifty or sixty jin are old, and it is not tasty to eat; only sheep weighing around 40 jin are called "delicate and fat," which is just right. Third, it depends on which part of the sheep's body the meat comes from. Huang Gua Tiao, Da Sancha, Xiao Sancha, and Shang Nao are tender and delicious; the meat from the front legs, waist sockets, and neck is old, with many tendons, and not delicious. Fourth, it depends on the knife skills. Fine knife skills, the skin, tendons, and bone fragments are removed cleanly, and the meat is sliced thinly, it tastes good; rough knife skills, the meat is full of tendons and bone fragments, it doesn't taste good. Fifth, it depends on the series of "timing" from slicing the meat to blanching it, slicing and blanching it immediately, it's cooked as soon as it's blanched, it tastes good; slicing it and letting it cool for an hour or two, it won't cook immediately when blanched, it doesn't taste good. Sixth, it depends on the quality of the seasonings and whether the seasoning is good. In addition, if you want to delve into it carefully, there is a lot of attention to be paid to it. These are all cooking arts extracted from decades of practical experience by the Chinese people, and are a creation of the Chinese people.

    For decades, Dong Lai Shun has been operating its business according to the special requirements of this cooking art. They are very careful in selecting mutton, only buying "delicate and fat" sheep, and only buying Huang Gua Tiao, Da Sancha, Xiao Sancha, and Shang Nao. The meat slicing workers they hire all have relatively good skills. The hot pot is also unique, the chimney is a section higher, the fire is strong and the water boils, it changes color as soon as it is blanched. The seasonings are all specially made by themselves, and the soy sauce is made with rock sugar. They also have their own set of methods for pickling sugar garlic. In this way, for decades, Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot has always been the best in Beijing.

    After liberation, especially after planned supply, some comrades in state-owned commercial departments did not supply Dong Lai Shun with various raw materials according to the special needs of mutton hot pot. In particular, the Dongdan Sixth Store of the Beijing Retail Company (hereinafter referred to as the Sixth Store), which was responsible for supplying them with mutton, not only sent mutton such as front legs that did not meet the requirements of mutton hot pot to Dong Lai Shun, but also sometimes sent goat meat, and the meat that could not be put into the pot had to be served. We went to Dong Lai Shun to visit the meat slicing. Two of the four workers were slicing front legs. As soon as the left hand pressed down, the meat slid. The knife couldn't go down, and when it did, it was a thick piece. The workers complained while slicing.

    Why can't Dong Lai Shun be fully guaranteed to get the mutton that meets the requirements? We also visited Zhao Shiguang, the person in charge of the Sixth Store. This person is very straightforward and stubbornly stubborn. The following is our conversation record:

    "Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot doesn't taste good anymore, is it related to the bad meat you supply?

    "We can't say that the meat we supply is bad. Before the Sixth Store started supplying mutton to Dong Lai Shun, the Beijing Retail Company had a principled instruction, saying that it should be completed as a political task, not only to ensure a sufficient quantity, but also to ensure quality..."

    "Are you doing things according to this instruction?"

    "Not entirely. I can't understand it. What kind of political task is this! There are so many mutton hot pot restaurants in Beijing. Small shops blanch front legs and waist sockets in the same way. Why is Dong Lai Shun so picky? If he picks like this, how much mutton will he need?!"

    "If you give the meat according to Dong Lai Shun's requirements, can the rest be sold?"

    "It can be sold. The rest is also good meat, and it's necessary to use this kind of meat for making dumplings. It's just that if our Sixth Store sells it alone, we're afraid we won't be able to sell it all."

    "Do other retail stores help sell it?"

    "That's fine. We sometimes do this too."

    "Why can't you do this often?"

    Zhao Shiguang couldn't answer, and then said: "Anyway, I can't figure it out. Why is it called a political task?"

    Guaranteeing the quality of Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot can indeed be said to be the Sixth Store's political task. Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot is the crystallization of the creative labor of the Chinese working people. Protecting this cooking art and inheriting and developing this precious national heritage, how is this not a political task? Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot doesn't taste good anymore, people will not only criticize Dong Lai Shun, criticize the unit of the commercial department, but also criticize the Party and the government, and criticize the socialist system. How is this not a political task? Zhao Shiguang and the Sixth Store's mistake lies in their failure to understand that this is a political task, and they have adopted an extremely rude attitude to treat this food production that is loved by the broad masses of people.

    We also talked with the public-private partnership representative of Dong Lai Shun for a long time. He told us that the "fixed quality and quantity" regulations proposed by the Beijing Third Commercial Bureau and the Beijing Catering Industry Association also forced Dong Lai Shun to reduce quality.

    In the past, Dong Lai Shun sold one jin of mutton for 1.28 yuan. After the public-private partnership, the price was reduced, and one jin of mutton was sold for 1.2 yuan. However, the Beijing Third Commercial Bureau believed that many restaurants sold mutton hot pot for only 1.08 yuan per jin, and forced Dong Lai Shun to also sell it for 1.08 yuan. This violated the principle of high quality and high price, and the quality of the mutton hot pot could not be guaranteed, and the quality of the dumplings was also poor. In the past, Dong Lai Shun's dumplings were more expensive than ordinary restaurants, but they had four major characteristics: thin skin, large filling, a lot of meat, and heavy oil. People said: "After eating dumplings at Dong Lai Shun, the vinegar bowl becomes an oil bowl." Now that we want to fix quality and price, the quality of the dumplings can only be reduced.

    "Of course, the fact that Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot doesn't taste good cannot only be blamed on the state-owned commercial department," the public-private partnership representative said to us: "There are also problems with Dong Lai Shun's work. Take me for example! When I arrived at Dong Lai Shun, I didn't grasp the characteristics of Dong Lai Shun well enough, and I didn't have a very clear idea of preserving these characteristics. Take meat slicing, seeing that the guests upstairs and downstairs were waiting anxiously, I urged the meat slicing workers to hurry up, but I didn't raise the issue of guaranteeing quality. For example, in the past, Dong Lai Shun's mutton was nominally half a jin per plate, but it was not weighed, and it all depended on the pair of eyes of the meat slicing worker to estimate, and it was inevitable that there would be more or less. After the public-private partnership, we wanted to guarantee the quantity. We thought that if we didn't weigh it, the enterprise would suffer, and the customers would suffer, so we implemented weighing, but the weighing method was not well-studied. The hot hands grabbed and tossed, and it had some impact on the quality and appearance of the meat."

    The problem that Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot doesn't taste good has already attracted the attention of the commercial department. Recently, some improvements have been made in the mutton supply work, and most of the sheep currently supplied are mutton sheep weighing around 40 jin. Dong Lai Shun's operations have also improved in some ways since the public-private partnership. Dong Lai Shun used to only have 53 tables, and the guests waiting for numbers downstairs were crowded into a pile, and the tables and benches upstairs were piled up to the ceiling with their feet facing the sky. Why didn't they do business? It turned out that the labor organization was unreasonable. At that time, waiters were running up and down to serve pots, meat, vegetables, and sesame cakes. The guests upstairs shouted and no one answered, and dozens of waiters downstairs were waiting impatiently in front of the pot and the meat counter. One waiter couldn't handle three tables. Now the labor organization has been changed. A supply station has been set up on each floor, and a waiter can handle six tables. The tables covered in dust have been taken out, and 52 tables have been added at once, and the business has doubled. Recently, due to the concern of all parties and its own efforts, the quality of Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot has been significantly improved.

    But up to now, there are still some problems with the quality of Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot that have not been solved or have not been completely solved: the mutton supply still cannot fully meet the requirements, the unreasonable selling price has not been changed, the wage system should be gradually made to conform to the principle of distribution according to work, and when the meat slicing workers are short of manpower and cannot cope, temporary workers should be hired to ensure the quality of operation.

    Dong Lai Shun's mutton hot pot can and should be even better. The people have the right to demand this. "Old Beijingers" still cannot help but sigh when they recall Dong Lai Shun. According to them, in the past one or two decades, Dong Lai Shun has lost many valuable characteristics. In the past, after eating mutton hot pot, they could make a pot of oily soup and add a string of mixed noodles. It was very delicious. Dong Lai Shun used to have hanging oven sesame cakes and cylinder oven sesame cakes, which were crispy and fragrant. They all hope that the lost characteristics can be restored. The workers at Dong Lai Shun told us that they are also preparing to do so, and the mixed noodles can be supplied in just three or five days.

    让东来顺的涮羊肉更好吃
    本报记者　王惠平　范荣康
    到北京来的人，都想尝尝东来顺的涮羊肉。
    每年立秋过后，天气转寒，东来顺的涮羊肉就上市了。三朋四友吃一餐，每人摊上八角一元的，价钱也算公道。“老北京”都把秋后上东来顺吃涮羊肉当着一种惬意的享受。占一个座，摆一只热气腾腾的火锅，调上辣椒油、虾油、芝麻酱和腐卤等各味作料，随意叫几盘羊肉，慢慢吃来，很有味道。爱吃肥的，叫一盘大三岔，肉色是一头白一头红；爱吃瘦的，叫一盘黄瓜条，肉色是一片红；要是愿吃半肥半瘦的，叫一盘小三岔正合适，这小三岔肉色又是一个样：两头红中间白。一盘一盘肉片端上来都是齐齐整整，切得薄薄的，卷成个小筒，看着舒适，吃起来又细又嫩。那怕是生平不吃羊肉的人，进了东来顺，也免不了说一声：“这羊肉就是不一样，没一点疝味。”
    东来顺饭馆的涮羊肉，在北京已经有40多年的历史了。北京人喜欢它，外地人喜欢它，国际友人也常慕名而至。一到假日，东来顺没有1，000斤羊肉就应付不了。中午和晚间，等着吃涮羊肉的人把东来顺的走道都站满了，候上半个钟点等到个座，还说是：“今儿不算挤。”
    可是，最近有一个时期，东来顺的涮羊肉竟不好吃了。肉盘子端上来，肉片一团一团的，放到锅里不是一条条，是一块块的，送进嘴里嚼不烂，咽不下。作料也差了。酱油不甜，芝麻酱粘舌头，辣椒油有时竟换成白水拌的辣椒末。佐食品也差了。从前的糖蒜，用手去皮，指上粘糊糊的，像是沾了一手蜜，味道又香又甜；现在的糖蒜好像从水缸里掏上来，清清淡淡的，又辣又苦。顾客们意见纷纷，有经验的老主顾进门来不是先占座，而是先打听：“今儿肉好不好。”店里的服务员打扫饭店，只见桌上地上尽是一堆堆嚼不烂的肉渣，心里也难受。
    为什么东来顺的涮羊肉一度不好吃了呢？
    说来话长。涮羊肉好吃不好吃，真可以算是一门学问。一要看是什么肉。是绵羊肉、山羊肉、是鲜羊肉，还是冻羊肉？绵羊肉细，好吃，山羊肉粗，不好吃。鲜羊肉嫩，好吃；冻羊肉老、不好吃。二要看是大羊，还是小羊。二三十斤的小羊，肉还没有长丰满，吃来无味；五六十斤的大羊，肉都老了，吃来也不是味；只有40斤上下的羊叫着“秀气肥”，正可口。三要看是羊身上那一部分的肉。黄瓜条，大三岔，小三岔，上脑嫩，好吃；前腿、腰窝、脖子等部分的肉老，筋多，不好吃。四要看刀功。刀功细，皮、筋、骨沫剔得干净，切得薄，好吃；刀功粗，肉里又是筋又是骨渣，不好吃。五要看从切肉到涮肉的一系列的“火候”，现涮现切，一涮就熟，好吃；切好了凉一二个钟头，涮下去一下熟不了，不好吃。六要看作料的质量怎么样，调味好不好。此外，要细细推敲起来，还有一大堆讲究。这些都是我国人民从几十年来的实际经验中提炼出来的烹调艺术，是我国人民的一项创造。
    几十年来，东来顺就是根据这种烹调艺术的特殊要求来经营企业的。他们挑羊肉很精细，光买“秀气肥”，而且还光买黄瓜条、大三岔、小三岔、上脑。他们请的切肉工人手艺都比较好。火锅也与众不同，烟囱高一截，火旺水沸，一涮就变色。作料也都是自己特制的，酱油是搁冰糖制的。泡糖蒜也有自己的一套方法。这样，几十年来，东来顺的涮羊肉在北京市一直独占鳌头。
    解放之后，特别是计划供应之后，国营商业部门的有些同志没有按照涮羊肉的特殊需要，供应东来顺各种原料，特别是负责供应他们羊肉的北京市零售公司东单第六店（以下简称六店），”不仅把前腿等不适合涮羊肉要求的羊肉送到东来顺，而且有的时候还把山羊肉送来了，上不得锅的肉也只好端了上去。我们到东来顺去参观切肉。四个工人中有两个切的是前腿。左手一按，肉就滑动。刀下不去，切下去也是厚厚的一块。工人们一边切一边怨。
    为什么不能完全保证东来顺得到适合要求的羊肉呢？我们又去访问六店的负责人赵世光。这人很直率，也固执得出奇。下面就是我们的谈话记录：
    “东来顺涮羊肉不好吃了，和你们供应的肉不好有没有关系？
    “不能说我们供应的肉不好。六店开始供应东来顺羊肉以前，北京市零售公司就有原则指示，说是要把它当政治任务来完成，不但要保证足够的数量，而且要保证质量……”
    “你们是按照这个指示办事的吗？”
    “没有完全做到。我思想不通。这算啥政治任务啊！北京市涮羊肉多的是，小铺子里前腿、腰窝一样涮，东来顺为啥挑剔这么苛刻。任他这么挑，要多少羊呵？！”
    “如果根据东来顺的要求给肉，剩下的能不能卖掉呢？”
    “卖倒是能卖。剩下的也是好肉，包饺子还非要这类肉不行。只是我们六店一家卖，怕卖不完。”
    “别的零售店帮着卖呢？”
    “那行。我们有时也是这么办的。”
    “为什么不能经常这么办呢？”
    赵世光答不上来了，后来才说：“反正我思想搞不通。为什么说是政治任务呢？”
    保证东来顺涮羊肉的质量，确实可以说是六店的政治任务。东来顺涮羊肉是我国劳动人民创造性劳动的结晶，爱护这种烹调艺术，继承和发扬这份宝贵的民族遗产，这怎么不是一件政治任务呢？东来顺的涮羊肉不好吃了，人们不只批评东来顺，批评商业部门的那一个单位，而且会批评党和政府，会批评社会主义制度。这怎么不是一件政治任务呢？赵世光和六店的错误，就在于他们不了解这是一个政治任务，采取了极其粗暴的态度来对待这一项广大人民所喜爱的食品生产。
    我们同东来顺的公股代表也谈了很久。他告诉我们，北京市第三商业局和北京市饮食业同业公会所提出“定质定量”的规定，也迫使东来顺降低质量。
    过去东来顺一斤羊肉卖1.28元。公私合营之后，价格降低了，一斤羊肉卖1.2元。但北京市第三商业局认为有许多饭馆的涮羊肉每斤只卖1.08元，硬让东来顺也卖1.08元。这就违反了优质优价的原则，涮羊肉的质量就不能保证，水饺的质量也差了。过去东来顺的水饺比一般饭馆贵，但它有四大特点：皮薄、馅大、肉多、油重。人们说：“到东来顺吃完水饺，醋碗变油碗。”现在要定质定价，水饺质量只能降低了。
    “当然，东来顺涮羊肉不好吃了，也不能只怪国营商业部门。”公股代表向我们说：“东来顺的工作也有问题。拿我来说吧！到了东来顺，对东来顺的特点是掌握得不够的，保存这种特点的思想也是不怎么明确的。拿切肉来说，看楼上楼下客人等得着急，我就催切肉工人快赶，却没有提出保证质量的问题。又比如过去东来顺的羊肉名义上每盘半斤，实际上不过秤，全凭切肉工人的一双眼估，免不了多点少点。公私合营后要保证数量，我们想不过秤，企业吃亏不好，顾客吃亏也不好，就实行过秤，可是过秤的方法没有研究好，热手抓来抓去，三两下折腾，对肉的质量、美观都有一些影响。”
    东来顺的涮羊肉不好吃了，这个问题已经引起商业部门的注意。最近，羊肉供应工作已有一些改进，现在供应的羊已经大部分是40斤上下的绵羊了。东来顺从公私合营后经营也有一些改善的地方。东来顺过去只摆53张桌子，楼下等着叫号的客人挤成一堆，楼上桌子板凳四脚朝天堆上天花板，为什么有生意不做呢？原来是劳动组织不合理。那时候服务员端锅、端肉、端菜、端烧饼都是楼上楼下乱跑，上面客人叫喊没人应，下面几十个服务员围在锅前，肉案子前，也是等得不耐烦。一个服务员管三张桌面也管不过来。现在改变了劳动组织，每层楼上置了一个供应站，一个服务员可以管六张桌面，满藏着灰尘的桌子给抬出来，一下子就添了52张，营业扩大了一倍。最近，东来顺的涮羊肉，由于各方面的关怀，和自己的努力，质量有了显著的提高。
    但是一直到现在为止，东来顺涮羊肉的质量还有一些问题没有解决或没有彻底解决：羊肉供应还不能完全合乎要求，不合理的售价还没有改变，工资制度应该逐步做到符合按劳付酬的原则，切肉工人力量不足忙不过来的时候，应当雇用临时工，以保证操作质量。
    东来顺的涮羊肉完全可以而且应该更好吃。人民有权利这样要求。“老北京”们回忆起东来顺来，至今仍是不堪感慨。据他们说，近一二十年来，东来顺已经失去了许多宝贵的特点。以前吃完涮羊肉，凑一锅油汤，可以下一挂杂面条。非常可口。东来顺从前还有吊炉烧饼，缸炉烧饼，又酥又香。他们都希望失掉的特点能重新恢复起来。东来顺的工人告诉我们，他们也正准备这么做，杂面条只隔三、五天就可以供应了。
