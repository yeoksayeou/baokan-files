    Mass Breeding of Piglets
    Jiang Huilong
    With the great development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, more and more farmers are requesting to raise pigs, and a phenomenon of insufficient supply of piglets has appeared in rural areas. In the production plan of Gao'an County, Jiangxi Province, it was decided to raise 131,051 pigs in 1956; with 91,086 households in the county, if each household raises one pig, plus the collectively owned pigs raised by agricultural producers' cooperatives, this target is not difficult to achieve. The current problem is mainly the lack of pig sources. Some farmers have gone to the market fairs many times but cannot buy a single piglet. The lack of pig sources has stimulated the rise in piglet prices. In the past, piglets cost only 3 jiao per jin, but now they have risen to 5 jiao 4 fen. Many farmers worry and say, "We must find a way to solve this! Otherwise, the pig raising plan will fall through." Gao'an County currently has a total of 43,068 pigs. To reach the 1956 target, it needs to breed another 87,983. However, the county has only 2,521 sows. Calculating at 25 piglets per sow per year, there will only be 63,025 by the end of 1956, a shortfall of 24,958. Similar situations exist in other counties as well.
    In order to massively breed piglets, the first thing to do is to increase the number of sows. However, many places have not paid enough attention to this issue. Gonghe Township in Gao'an County will increase 449 pigs this year, but the whole township currently has only two sows. Such a situation is by no means isolated. We must take good care of the existing sows and supply them with sufficient feed in order to breed a large number of piglets.

    大量繁殖小猪
    姜惠龙
    随着农业生产合作社的大发展，农民要求养猪的越来越多，农村中就出现了小猪供不应求的现象。江西省高安县的生产规划中，决定在1956年养猪131，051只；全县91，086户，如果每户养一只，再加上农业生产合作社养的公有猪，这个指标是不难达到的。目前的问题主要是猪源缺乏，有的农民多次跑到圩场，也买不到一头小猪。猪源缺乏刺激了小猪价格上涨。过去小猪每斤只要3角，现在涨到5角4分。许多农民发愁地说：“要想办法解决呀！不然，养猪的计划要落空了”。高安县现在共计有猪43，068只，要达到1956年的指标，需要再繁殖87，983只。但是全县只有母猪2，521只，以每只每年繁殖25只计算，到1956年底只有63，025只，还差24，958只。类似这样的情况，在别的县也是有的。
    为了大量繁殖小猪，首先要增加一定数量的母猪。可是，很多地方并没有重视这个问题。高安县共和乡今年要增加449只猪，但是全乡目前只有两只母猪。这样的情况绝不是个别的。一定要把现有的母猪养好，给它供应充足的饲料，以便大量繁殖小猪。
