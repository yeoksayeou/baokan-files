    The Ministry of Supervision Instructs All Regions to Strengthen Supervision and Inspection of Agricultural Leadership Work

    The Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China issued instructions to the supervisory organs of all provinces (autonomous regions) on the 24th, requiring them to continue to strengthen the supervision and inspection of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production.

    The instructions stated that in order to ensure the rapid and healthy development of agricultural cooperation and the over-fulfillment of agricultural production increase plans, supervisory organs at all levels below the provincial and autonomous region level must, under the unified leadership of the Party committees and People's Committees at all levels, actively supervise and inspect the implementation of the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party by administrative organs and their staff at all levels, the correct implementation of the State Council's resolutions, orders, instructions and various measures related to agricultural production increase. Oppose conservative thinking, oppose bureaucracy, commandism, and acts of violating laws and regulations.

    The instructions pointed out that the supervisory organs in all regions must focus on agricultural (animal husbandry) production increase, formulate comprehensive plans based on the specific conditions of each region and different seasons, and appropriately arrange the agricultural supervision work for 1956. They should use their main strength to select several specific issues in several regions or units and conduct systematic and in-depth inspections. For example, during the spring plowing season, inspect seed regulation, the supply of agricultural tools and fertilizers, and agricultural loans and spring planting plans; in summer and autumn, inspect summer planting and autumn planting plans, flood prevention, and flood control work; in winter, inspect winter planting plans, forest protection and fire prevention, the protection of draught animals, and the construction of farmland water conservancy projects; and during each production season, focus on inspecting the work of agricultural technology promotion.

    The instructions concluded by pointing out that the focus of inspection work should be on the county level, but in order to understand the situation at the lower levels and to go deep among the masses, some key districts and townships should also be selected for comprehensive inspection, and if necessary, the agricultural departments of provinces and special districts should also be inspected.

    监察部指示各地加强对农业领导工作的监督检查
    中华人民共和国监察部24日向各省（自治区）监察机关发布指示，要求继续加强对农业合作化和农业生产的监督和检查。
    指示说，为了保证农业合作化迅速健康地发展、农业增产计划超额完成，各省、自治区以下各级监察机关必须在各级党委和人民委员会统一领导下，积极地监督和检查各级行政机关及其工作人员贯彻党的七届六中全会决议、正确地执行国务院有关农业方面的决议、命令、指示和有关农业增产的各项措施。反对保守思想，反对官僚主义、强迫命令、违法乱纪的行为。
    指示指出，各地监察机关必须以农业（畜牧业）增产为中心，根据各地具体情况和不同的季节，制定全面的规划，恰当地安排1956年农业监察工作。要以主要力量在若干地区或单位选择若干专门问题，系统地深入地进行检查。例如，春耕时期检查种籽调剂、农具肥料供应和农业贷款、春种计划等；夏秋季检查夏种和秋种计划、防汛、防洪工作等；冬季检查冬种计划、护林防火、耕畜保护工作和兴修农田水利工作等；各个生产季节都应有重点的检查农业技术推广工作。
    指示最后指出：检查工作的重点应该放在县，但为了了解下面情况和深入群众，也应该选择若干重点区、乡进行全面检查，必要时对省、专区农业部门也应该检查。（据新华社讯）
