Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 28th — Damascus dispatch: Syrian Interior Minister Ali Bouzo told a "Flag Newspaper" reporter on February 27th that Syria refused to buy arms from the United States because the United States insisted on concluding a "common security treaty" with Syria.
    Bouzo said that Syria's "arms negotiations with the United States had been delayed for a long time, and finally, when we learned in December last year that the United States wanted to make the sale of (arms) conditional on concluding a common security treaty with Syria, the negotiations stopped."

    叙利亚拒绝购买美国军火
    新华社28日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚内政部长阿里·波佐2月27日对“旗帜报”记者说，叙利亚拒绝从美国购买军火，因为美国坚持要同叙利亚缔结一项“共同安全条约”。
    波佐说，叙利亚同美国的“军火谈判拖延了很久，最后当去年12月我们知道了美国要以同叙利亚缔结一项共同安全条约为出售（军火）的条件的时候，谈判就停止了”。
