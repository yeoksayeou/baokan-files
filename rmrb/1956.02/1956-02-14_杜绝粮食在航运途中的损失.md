To the Editor:

From January to September 1955, grain-carrying vessels in Sichuan Province experienced 188 maritime accidents, resulting in the sinking or water damage of grain, and the cost of salvage, amounting to a loss of over 150,000 yuan. The primary reason for the frequent maritime accidents is the irresponsible work of some employees in the shipping department. More than 90% of the accidents last year were man-made, caused by violating navigation regulations, taking wrong routes, dereliction of duty, and sailing in fog. For example, although the Yangtze River channel has clear markers, the "Kuixia" vessel of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau ran aground near Yangduxi in Zhongxian County on September 1, 1955, due to the pilot taking the wrong route, causing water damage to a batch of grain. On June 17, 1955, the "Jiangfeng" vessel rushed to make a voyage and sped through the fog in Chongqing Port, leading to an accident. Inland River Navigation Bureau Tugboat No. 401 violated navigation rules and operated improperly, causing the two barges carrying grain it was towing to run aground and leak. On October 17, 1955, a steamship of the Chongqing Port Authority insisted on towing a wooden boat without a captain present in Xiaoxin River, Chongqing. As a result, the towing rope slipped after the anchor was raised, and the wooden boat collided with a barge and broke apart and sank, resulting in the total loss of 238 packages of grain.

Some ships also failed to promptly salvage grain after maritime accidents occurred. For example, after the "Jiangfeng" vessel had an accident, it failed to promptly remove the dry grain. It was delayed until night, and another compartment of the ship took on water, resulting in more than 600 additional packages of grain being water damaged. When the "Minxian" vessel had a maritime accident on November 27, 1955, and the grain was water damaged, they also failed to promptly transport the wet grain to the designated pier for the grain management department to sort out and salvage, thereby expanding the losses.

What is strange is that the shipping department is always unwilling to be held responsible for compensating for the losses caused by these maritime accidents. For example, the "Yingshan" vessel of the Chongqing Shipping Branch ran aground near Wagangyao in Changshou County on August 2, 1955, resulting in damage to a batch of grain being transported for the Dazhu County Grain Bureau. Since the weather was calm and the location was not a dangerous rapid, the Dazhu County Grain Bureau requested compensation for the losses. Although the Chongqing Shipping Branch admitted that the accident was caused by the crew's negligence, they believed that they should not be held responsible for compensation and even wanted the cargo owner to bear the cost of salvaging the goods.

None of the maritime accidents that occurred in Sichuan Province from January to October 1955 have been settled. Because there has been no serious handling and no compensation, this has fostered the shipping department's irresponsible attitude, and therefore, they cannot truly learn from the accidents to improve their work, and maritime accidents have increased rather than decreased. In just 11 days from November 17 to 27, 1955, six maritime accidents occurred consecutively to grain-carrying vessels on the Yangtze River line.

In order to ensure that the grain in Sichuan Province is not lost during outward transfer, we request the Ministry of Communications to conduct an in-depth inspection of the frequent maritime accidents, handle them seriously, and urge the shipping department to earnestly improve its work. At the same time, after a maritime accident occurs, the shipping department should actively salvage the goods, and for man-made losses, the responsibility should be investigated and dealt with.

### 杜绝粮食在航运途中的损失

    杜绝粮食在航运途中的损失编辑同志：
    从1955年1月到9月，四川省的运粮船只共发生海损事故188次，沉没的粮食和被水打湿的粮食，加上抢救费用，损失在人民币15万元以上。海损事故不断发生的主要原因，是航运部门的一部分职工工作不负责任。去年发生的事故，有90％以上都是由于违犯航章、错走航线、玩忽职守、冒雾航行而造成的人为事故。例如，长江航道已有明显标志，但是长江航务局“奎峡”号轮船在1955年9月1日行驶到忠县羊肚溪的时候，却因为引水错走航线，触礁进水，使一批粮食受到损失。1955年6月17日，“江酆”号轮船为了赶航次，就在重庆港内冒雾快车行驶，以致发生事故。内河航务局401号拖轮违章航行，操作不当，以致拖带的两只载运粮食的驳船都触礁撞漏。1955年10月17日，重庆港务局的火轮在重庆小河心硬要拖走一只驾长不在的木船，结果起锚后拖绳滑钩，木船碰在一只驳船上而折断沉没了，船上装运的238包粮食全部损失了。
    有些船只在发生海损事故以后，还不及时抢救粮食。例如，“江酆”轮在发生事故以后，没有及时把干的粮食提取出来，一直拖延到夜里，轮船的另一个舱也进了水，以致又打湿粮食600多包。“民宪”轮在1955年11月27日发生海损事故，粮食被打湿了，他们也不及时把湿粮运到指定的码头，让粮食管理部门整理抢救，因而扩大了损失。
    令人奇怪的是，航运部门对这些海损事故所造成的损失，总是不肯负责赔偿。例如，重庆航运分局“营山”号轮1955年8月2日在长寿县附近瓦罐窑触礁，承运的大竹县粮食局的一批粮食受到了损失。由于当时风平浪静，出事地点又不是险滩急流，因此大竹县粮食局要求赔偿损失。重庆航运分局虽然承认事故是船员的过失所造成的，但是却认为他们不应该负赔偿的责任，并且还要货主负担抢救物资的费用。
  1955年1月到10月四川省所发生的海损事故，没有一件是清理结案的。就因为没有严肃处理，没有赔偿，就助长了航运部门不负责任的恶劣思想，因而就不能切实地从事故中接受教训来改进工作，海损事故也就有增无减。光是1955年11月17日到27日的11天中，长江线内运粮轮船就连续发生海损事故6起。
    为了保证四川省粮食在外调途中不受损失，我们要求交通部对海损事故频繁的情况进行深入的检查，严肃的处理，督促航运部门认真改进工作；同时，在海损事故发生以后，航运部门应该积极抢救，对于人为的损失，还应该查明责任，进行处理。
