Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa: British Prime Minister Eden and Foreign Secretary Lloyd left Ottawa by plane on February 8th to return to London. After arriving in Ottawa on February 3rd, they held several talks with Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent and Foreign Minister Pearson.

On February 7th, Eden and Lloyd held a press conference in Ottawa. Eden said at the press conference: "We must continue to make every effort" to ease tensions with the Soviet Union.

A reporter asked Eden at the meeting: "Bulganin and Khrushchev have delivered speeches like that in India, Burma and Afghanistan. Is the invitation to invite them to visit Britain still valid?" Eden replied: "Still valid."

When answering questions about the recognition of the People's Republic of China, Eden said, "Our recognition of China does not mean approving or disapproving of its government. It is recognizing a fact." Eden said that since the 1954 Geneva Conference, contact between British representatives and the Chinese authorities in Beijing has increased, "which is undoubtedly beneficial."

When Lloyd spoke about the Indochina issue at the press conference, he said that Britain's policy was to maintain the armistice agreement signed in Geneva in 1954. As everyone knows, this agreement requires general elections to be held throughout Vietnam this summer.

    艾登和劳埃德在加拿大
    谈英国同中苏的关系
    据新华社讯　渥太华消息：英国首相艾登和外交大臣劳埃德已经在2月8日乘飞机离渥太华回伦敦。他们在2月3日到达渥太华后，曾经同加拿大总理圣劳伦和外交部长皮尔逊举行了多次会谈。
    2月7日，艾登和劳埃德在渥太华举行了记者招待会。艾登在招待会上说：“我们必须继续尽一切努力”来缓和同苏联之间的紧张局势。
    有一个记者在会上问艾登：“布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在印度、缅甸和阿富汗发表了那样一些演说，请他们访问英国的邀请还有效吗？”艾登回答说：“仍然有效。”
    艾登在回答关于承认中华人民共和国的问题的时候说，“我们承认中国并不意味赞同或者不赞同它的政府。这是承认事实。”艾登说，自从1954年日内瓦会议以来，英国代表同北京的中国当局之间的接触已经有了增加，“这无疑是有益的”。
    劳埃德在记者招待会上谈到印度支那问题的时候说，英国的政策是维持1954年在日内瓦签订的停战协定。大家知道，这个协定要求在今年夏天举行全越选举。
