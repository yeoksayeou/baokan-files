    To Chinese Listeners:
    Dear Comrades! Dear Friends! Six years ago, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed in Moscow. This treaty vividly reflects the fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries, demonstrating their desire to assist each other, to expand and consolidate the economic and cultural ties between the two countries, and to strengthen the cause of world peace. This historically significant document received enthusiastic responses from hundreds of millions of Soviet and Chinese people. The signing date of the treaty has become a grand festival that is widely celebrated in our two countries every year.
    Today, I am happy to extend my heartfelt greetings to you on behalf of the millions of residents of the Soviet capital.
    The Soviet people closely watch your creative labor and your rapid progress on the road to building a new and powerful China. Not long ago, we were pleased to learn that the citizens of Beijing were the first to complete the socialist transformation of industry and commerce ahead of schedule during the First Five-Year Plan. We Soviet people express our joy at your achievements in agricultural cooperation. Millions of laborers in the countryside have responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party to join cooperatives and have steadily embarked on the socialist road. We congratulate you on this great victory on the socialist road.
    We are also happy to share our achievements with you. Enterprises in Moscow completed the plan for the last year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan two weeks ahead of schedule. Our capital is becoming more and more beautiful every day! Its construction is constantly improving. Last year alone, more than 1 million square meters of residential housing were built in Moscow, along with 40 schools, 19 hospitals, 90 kindergartens and nurseries, and 115 new stores were opened. A month ago, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union published a draft directive on the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union. This plan stipulates vigorous development of all sectors of the national economy and a significant improvement in the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. The people of Moscow, like all the people of the Soviet Union, warmly support the draft directive on the new Five-Year Plan. Employees of 20 advanced enterprises in Moscow and the Moscow region are preparing to gloriously greet the 20th Congress of the Party. They have issued a call to launch a socialist competition to complete the 1956 plan—the first year plan of the Sixth Five-Year Plan—ahead of schedule. The patriotic call of the Muscovites has been warmly responded to by workers all over the Soviet Union.
    The friendly ties between the capitals of our two countries are expanding year by year. Last year, the people of Moscow hosted their most respected guests, numerous delegations of Chinese workers, scientists, teachers, doctors, legal workers, and journalists. The people of Moscow admired the outstanding art of the remarkable Chinese craftsmen at the Chinese Applied Arts Exhibition. They enthusiastically cheered the wonderful performances of the Yue Opera actors, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, and the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe. The residents of Moscow treat the Chinese workers and engineers who are currently interning in Moscow factories, as well as the Chinese students studying in the capital's universities, as if they were their own brothers. Muscovites who have visited your beautiful capital speak excitedly about your love and care for the representatives of the Soviet people.
    Finally, let me shout:
    Long live the great fraternal alliance of the people of the Soviet Union and China!

    苏联共产党莫斯科市委员会第一书记福尔采娃
    对中国听众的广播讲话
    亲爱的同志们！亲爱的朋友们！六年以前，在莫斯科签订了苏中友好同盟互助条约。这个条约鲜明地反映出我们两国人民之间的兄弟般的情谊，表现出他们力求互相援助，力求扩大和巩固两国的经济和文化联系以及巩固世界和平事业的意愿。这个具有历史意义的文件，得到了成万万苏联人和中国人的热烈响应。条约的签订日成了我们两国每年广泛庆祝的盛大的节日。
    我今天高兴地代表苏联首都的几百万居民向你们致衷心的敬礼。
    苏联人密切地注视着你们创造性的劳动，注视着你们在建设新的强大的中国的道路上的飞跃前进。不久以前，我们高兴地知道了北京市民首先提前完成了第一个五年计划期间对工商业的社会主义改造的任务。我们苏联人对你们在农业合作化方面获得的成就表示欢欣。农村的成千百万的劳动者响应中国共产党的号召参加了合作社，稳定地走上了社会主义的道路。我们祝贺你们在社会主义道路上获得的这一巨大胜利。
    我们也高兴地愿意把自己的成就告诉你们。莫斯科的企业提前两个星期完成了第五个五年计划的最后一年的计划。我们的首都一天天越来越美丽！它的建设不断的改进。光是去年，在莫斯科就建筑了100多万平方公尺面积的居住房屋，40所学校、19个医院、90个幼儿园和托儿所，开办了115个新商店。一个月以前，公布了苏联共产党关于发展苏联国民经济第六个五年计划的指示草案。这个计划规定大力发展国民经济的一切部门，大大提高苏联人民的物质和文化水平。莫斯科人也和全苏联人一样热烈地拥护关于新的五年计划的指示草案。莫斯科市和莫斯科州的20个先进企业的员工，准备光荣地迎接党的第二十次代表大会。他们发出了号召，为提前完成1956年计划——第六个五年计划的第一年计划，展开社会主义竞赛。莫斯科人的爱国号召得到全苏联工人们的热烈响应。
    我们两国首都的友谊联系一年年的扩大。去年，莫斯科人招待了自己的最尊重的客人，许许多多的中国工人、科学家、教师、医生、法律工作者和新闻记者代表团。莫斯科人曾经在中国实用美术展览会上欣赏卓越的中国匠人的出色的艺术。他们曾向越剧演员的精采表演、中国人民解放军歌舞团、中国杂技团热烈地喝采。莫斯科居民像招待自己的亲兄弟那样招待目前在莫斯科各工厂实习的中国工人和工程师，以及在首都高等学校学习的中国学生。到过你们美好首都的莫斯科人，都激动地谈论你们对苏联人民的代表的热爱和关怀。
    最后，让我高呼：
    苏中两国人民的伟大兄弟联盟万岁！
