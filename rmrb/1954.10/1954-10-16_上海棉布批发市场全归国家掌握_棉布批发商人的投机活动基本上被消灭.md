The Shanghai cotton fabric wholesale market has now been completely replaced by the state-organized market, and the speculative activities of cotton fabric wholesalers have been basically eliminated. All private cotton fabric retailers in the city have been brought into the orbit of state planning. Four hundred and fifty-three private cotton fabric retail stores and nine homespun cloth retail stores have been converted into distribution stores of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. Seven hundred and forty-five cotton fabric stallholders have established distribution relationships with the Shanghai Municipal Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. The city's two hundred and seventy-four private cotton fabric wholesalers have also been basically settled. Among them, fifty-seven have changed professions, twelve have switched to retail businesses, distributing cotton fabric from the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and the rest have been approved by the government to cease operations. The funds of those who have ceased operations will be invested in undertakings beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood under the guidance of the government. The inventory will be purchased by state-owned companies at a price. More than 800 employees have been assigned to work or participate in training courses opened by the Shanghai Municipal Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. Capital agents and capitalists are also being dealt with appropriately according to the specific circumstances. All cotton fabric distribution stores report their purchasing and sales plans to the Shanghai Municipal Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company every month, purchase goods from the nine state-owned cotton fabric wholesale departments distributed in appropriate areas of the city according to the plan, and sell them at the retail prices set by the state-owned companies.

Before liberation, cotton yarn and cloth were one of the main "speculative chips" alongside gold and rice in Shanghai's speculative market. In the years after liberation, many cotton fabric wholesalers in Shanghai still disregarded the interests of the people and adopted various illegal means to speculate and profiteer with cotton fabric. The People's Government has continuously taken various measures to combat the speculative activities of cotton fabric wholesalers in order to protect the interests of consumers. In the early days of Shanghai's liberation, Shanghai's cotton fabric speculators took advantage of the unstable foothold of state-owned commerce and made waves, repeatedly causing national price "surge" led by cotton yarn and cloth. In one "surge" from late June to late July 1949, the price of each roll of Longtou fine cloth quadrupled. Another "surge" occurred three months later, and the cloth price quadrupled again in more than 30 days. During this period, the People's Government sold large quantities of cotton yarn and cloth on the market, which suppressed the "surge." By March 1950, with the unification of national finance and economy, prices began to stabilize, and Shanghai's cotton fabric speculators suffered a fatal blow. At that time, cotton fabric speculators rushed to sell cotton fabric, including Longtou fine cloth produced in 1937, which had been stockpiled for 13 years.

With the stabilization of prices and the increase in people's demand for cotton fabric, cotton fabric wholesalers from almost all over the country came to Shanghai to purchase cotton fabric. Shanghai's cotton fabric speculators colluded with some speculators from other places to carry out illegal activities. In order to bring cotton fabric transactions into line and eliminate speculation, the Shanghai Cotton Fabric Exchange was established in September 1951 under the guidance of the People's Government. The exchange stipulated that various fabrics should be sold at listed prices and given priority to retailers in the city. At this time, cotton fabric speculators from other places and local areas turned to black market transactions, drove up cloth prices, and snapped up best-selling cotton fabrics. The industrial and commercial administrative departments stipulated that cotton fabric sales of more than 20 rolls must be conducted on the exchange, so speculators broke up the sales into smaller quantities and conducted black market transactions. At that time, the amount of black market transactions was more than six times higher than the amount of exchange transactions.

In order to combat yarn and cloth speculation in the market and ensure the normal supply of people's needs, the People's Government implemented unified purchase of cotton yarn in January 1951. Later, state-owned commerce gradually expanded the processing and sales of private dyeing and weaving industries. By the end of 1952, the amount of cotton fabric flowing into the Shanghai wholesale market had been reduced to 23% of the total cotton fabric production of private factories in the city. At this time, although the "Five-Anti Campaign" had passed and the "five evils" of illegal capitalists had been dealt a head-on blow by the people of the whole country, some cotton fabric speculators still carried out speculative activities and competed with state-owned commerce for sources of goods. In the first half of 1953, cotton fabric speculators generally used methods such as paying deposits in advance, ordering goods at high prices, and selling on credit with promissory notes to snap up cotton fabric. At that time, thread and woven products were selling well, and some speculators used prices that were more than 50% higher than the processing fees of state-owned commerce to process thread and woven products from cloth factories, disrupting the processing plans of state-owned commerce. Cotton fabric wholesalers from other places also rushed to purchase from Shanghai's private cotton fabric dyeing and weaving factories and wholesalers. In June 1953, the Juyixing Cloth Store in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, bought cotton fabric in Shanghai using "forward checks," exceeding the amount that its actual funds could buy by more than 18 times. At that time, more than 90% of the transactions between Shanghai's private cotton fabric dyeing and weaving factories and private merchants were in the form of such forward checks, with payment times ranging from 40 days from the date of issue. Later, through the government's strengthening of market and financial management, this kind of speculative behavior of buying short and selling short was gradually stopped.

In the second half of 1953, state-owned commerce strengthened the internal allocation of best-selling fabrics and planned to supply the needs of people in various places. However, Shanghai's cotton fabric speculators colluded with speculators from other places to engage in speculation, blindly trafficking and transporting, and disrupting the state's supply plans. Some private merchants sold to foreign merchants on the same day they purchased from state-owned commerce, making a 20% profit in one turnover. At that time, many best-selling cotton fabrics were controlled by state-owned commercial departments, and some cotton fabric merchants used other brands of cotton fabric to impersonate best-selling fabrics, and even sold inferior fabrics and brittle fabrics that could not be used to make clothes as good fabrics. By October 1953, all cotton fabrics produced by private factories in Shanghai were processed and sold by state-owned commerce. Speculators turned to handicraft weaving factories where the source of goods was not controlled by state-owned commerce and engaged in speculative activities for products such as corduroy. Not only did they raise prices, but some also sold all-yarn corduroy as blended yarn products.

After the implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton fabric, the city's cotton fabric production was controlled by state-owned commerce, cotton fabric wholesalers were banned, and cotton fabric retailers established distribution relationships with state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies. Black market transactions were eliminated, and the people of Shanghai would no longer be harmed by the speculative activities of cotton fabric wholesalers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海棉布批发市场全归国家掌握
    棉布批发商人的投机活动基本上被消灭
    上海市棉布批发市场现在已经完全为国家有组织的市场所代替，棉布批发商人的投机活动已基本被消灭。全市私营棉布零售商已全部纳入国家计划轨道。四百五十三家私营棉布零售店和九家土布零售店已改为国家花纱布公司经销店，七百四十五户棉布摊贩和中国花纱布公司上海市公司建立了经销关系。全市二百七十四户私营棉布批发商也基本上安排完毕。其中有五十七户转业，十二户改营零售业务，经销国营花纱布公司的棉布，其余的都已由政府批准歇业。歇业户的资金将在政府指导下投入有利于国计民生的事业，存货都由国营公司作价收购，职工八百多人已分别安置工作或参加中国花纱布公司上海市公司开设的训练班学习；资方代理人和资本家也按照具体情况作适当处理。所有棉布经销店每月向中国花纱布公司上海市公司报告进货和销售的计划，按计划向分布在全市适当地区的九个国营棉布批发部进货，并按照国营公司的零售牌价出售。
    解放以前，纱布是上海投机市场上和黄金、大米并列的主要“投机筹码”之一。解放以后几年来，上海很多棉布批发商人仍旧丝毫不顾人民的利益，采取各种各样的不法手段，拿棉布来投机倒把获取暴利。人民政府为了保障消费者的利益，曾不断地采取各种措施，打击棉布批发商人的投机活动。上海解放初期，上海市的棉布投机商人乘国营商业立脚未稳，大肆兴风作浪，几度以纱布领头引起全国性的物价“涨风”。在一九四九年六月下旬到七月底的一次“涨风”中，每匹龙头细布的价格上涨四倍；三个月以后又发生一次“涨风”，三十多天中布价又上涨四倍。在这期间，人民政府在市场抛售大量棉纱和布匹，才把“涨风”抑平下来。到一九五零年三月，全国财经统一，物价开始稳定，上海的棉布投机商遭到了致命的打击。那时棉布投机商纷纷抛出棉布，抛出的棉布中竟有囤积了十三年的一九三七年出厂的龙头细布。
    随着物价平稳和人民对棉布需要的增加，几乎全国各地都有棉布批发商人到上海来采买棉布。上海的棉布投机商就和外地商人中一部分投机商联结在一起，进行非法活动。为了使棉布交易纳入正轨，取缔投机，一九五一年九月，上海市棉布交易所在人民政府辅导下成立。交易所内规定各种布匹按牌价出卖，并且优先卖给本市的零售商。这时外地和本地的棉布投机商人就转入黑市交易，哄抬布价，抢购畅销棉布。工商行政管理部门规定二十匹以上的棉布买卖必须在交易所进行，投机商人就化整为零，进行黑市交易。当时黑市交易的数量，比交易所交易数量高出六倍多。
    人民政府为了打击市场上的纱布投机，保证对人民需要的正常供应，曾在一九五一年一月实行棉纱统购。以后，国营商业又逐步扩大对私营染织业的加工、包销。到一九五二年年底，流入上海批发市场上的棉布，已经减少到占全市私营工厂棉布生产总量的百分之二十三。这时虽已经过“五反”，不法资本家的“五毒”行为遭受了全国人民的迎头痛击，但是部分棉布投机商人仍然进行投机活动，和国营商业抢夺货源。一九五三年上半年，棉布投机商普遍地用预付定金、高价定货、期票赊销等办法，抢购棉布。当时线织品畅销，有些投机商人就用比国营商业的工缴费高一半以上的价格，向布厂加工线织品，破坏国营商业的加工计划。外地的棉布批发商人也大量向上海的私营棉布染织厂和批发商抢购。一九五三年六月，山西省太原市的聚义兴布号在上海用“远期支票”的办法买去的棉布，超过它的实际资金所能买得的数量十八倍多。当时上海私营棉布染织工厂和私商的交易中，百分之九十以上是这种远期支票，有的支票从开出到付款时间长达四十天。后来经过人民政府加强对市场和金融的管理，这种买空卖空的投机行为才逐渐被制止。
    一九五三年下半年，国营商业加强畅销布的内部调拨，有计划地供应各地人民需要。但是上海的棉布投机商人又和外地的投机商人结合在一起，进行套购，盲目贩运，破坏国家的供应计划。有些私商向国营商业买进后，当天就转卖给外来商人，一转手之间获取暴利百分之二十。当时许多畅销的棉布已由国营商业部门掌握，有些棉布商就用其他牌号的棉布冒充畅销布，甚至把次布和不能做衣服的脆布冒充好布出卖。到一九五三年十月，上海市所有私营工厂生产的棉布全部由国营商业加工、包销，投机商人又转到货源没有为国营商业掌握的手工织布工场中去，对灯芯绒等产品从事投机活动。他们不但抬高价格，有的还以全纱灯芯绒冒充纱线交织品出卖。
    实行棉布计划收购计划供应以后，全市的棉布生产由国营商业掌握，棉布批发商被取缔，棉布零售商都和国营花纱布公司建立了经销关系，黑市交易被消灭，上海市人民再不会受棉布批发商人投机活动的危害了。　（新华社）
