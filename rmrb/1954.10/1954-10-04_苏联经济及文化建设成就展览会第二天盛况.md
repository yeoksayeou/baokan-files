The Grand Occasion of the Second Day of the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction
October 3rd marked the second day of the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction. Over 80,000 people visited today, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

The weather was clear today. The flags of China and the Soviet Union, along with the flags of the sixteen Soviet republics, fluttered in the breeze from the silvery-white flagpoles on both sides of the Soviet Exhibition Center square. The gilded iron tower and the golden inscription of "Soviet Exhibition Hall" written by Chairman Mao above the main entrance of the central hall shone brilliantly in the sunlight. Inside and outside the exhibition hall, flowers bloomed in profusion, and the fountains sprayed water, further enhancing the beauty and grandeur of the entire building.

At nine o'clock in the morning, crowds began to pour into the Soviet Exhibition Hall and into the various exhibition halls from all directions. Among them were workers from factories and mines in Jiamusi, Baotou, Tangshan, and Beijing, farmers from agricultural producers' cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing, students from Taiyuan, Jinan, and Tianjin, soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army participating in the Beijing National Day parade and the first conference of artillery heroes, cadres from Yan'an, Wuhan, and Tongxian, as well as ethnic minorities from the border regions and returned overseas Chinese. They all visited the exhibition with great interest.

In the Industrial Hall, crowds of visitors gathered around the latest Soviet machines, listening to explanations from the guides and watching demonstrations by the operating workers. A planing machine measuring 7.5 meters in length and weighing over 20,000 kilograms attracted many viewers. Although the operating workers demonstrated it many times, the audience was reluctant to leave. When Soviet staff members demonstrated the coordinate boring machine, the audience all stopped to watch. One worker said: "This lathe is really amazing, it can rotate 2,800 revolutions per minute. Our lathe can only rotate a little over 1,000 revolutions at its fastest." After visiting, many workers from the Beijing People's Printing Factory held a small forum in the resting area to share their impressions and expressed their determination to further learn from the Soviet Union to build our country.

On the square east of the Industrial Hall, various machines were in operation, and the rumbling sounds invigorated the visitors. The "Donbas" coal mining combine, the 25-ton automatic unloading truck, and the huge excavator were surrounded by crowds. Next to the machinery displaying the construction of communist projects, Soviet staff members operated a single-bucket excavator, demonstrating excavation, turning, and unloading, exciting the construction workers who were watching. One construction worker said, "If we had these machines, it would save us so much effort!" Next to the electric locomotive and two all-metal passenger cars, there was a long queue, and visitors took turns to board and visit, all feeling very novel about the electric locomotive. In the agricultural machinery square, when the motors of the "Stalin No. 4" automatic grain combine harvester, the "Stalin No. 6" grain combine harvester, tractors, and cotton pickers were started, the audience surrounded them. Some farmers bent over to see how the cotton picking machine picked and sucked up cotton. Soviet staff and guides were on hand to answer the questions raised by the farmers one by one.

In the Cultural Hall, thousands of teachers and students were particularly interested in the model of Moscow University, which was thirty-two stories high. A student from the Department of Education of Beijing Normal University said: "The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. We must study hard to build a socialist motherland."

In the Agricultural Hall and the Food Industry Hall, the audience was attracted by the abundant grains, fruits, and foods of the Soviet Union. The more than 14 million hectares of wasteland that the Soviet Union had cultivated by the spring of 1954 produced many varieties of spring and winter wheat; among them, the No. 451 Southern Red Grain Winter Wheat, with its bright color and large grains, was praised by the audience. The apples cultivated by Michurin and his successors were of many varieties, including the "Gallevey Anise" apple, a hybrid of apple and pear, and the "Aport Algin" apple, weighing half a kilogram, with its bright color and fragrant aroma. One viewer said: "We must also produce such good and large apples on the land of our motherland."

Many viewers left their opinions in the guestbook after the visit. A viewer named Wang wrote: "I saw in the exhibition the happiness gained by the Soviet people through hard struggle and diligent work under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, which further increased my firm confidence in striving for a happy life." A visitor from Anshan wrote a poem after seeing the Industrial Hall, he wrote: "I am determined to contribute all my strength to build factory buildings one by one, and install machines piece by piece; let steel nourish the industrial flower of the motherland, and let the motherland be built as brilliantly as the Soviet Union." A soldier of the People's Liberation Army wrote: "Build it, my motherland! I will always defend you!"

The "Moscow" Restaurant belonging to the exhibition officially opened today, receiving guests with rich Moscow-style dishes; the cinema showed four shows today, including documentaries such as "Science and Technology", "Agricultural News", and "Selfless Labor of Caspian Oil Workers".

At six o'clock in the afternoon, the lights of the Soviet Exhibition Hall were all on, and the audience was still reluctant to leave.

    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会第二天盛况
    三日，这是苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会开幕的第二天。今天的参观者共八万多人，情况非常热烈。
    这一天，天气晴朗，苏联展览馆广场两侧银白色的旗杆上，中苏两国国旗和苏联十六个加盟共和国国旗随风飘扬。镏金铁塔和中央大厅正门上端毛主席的“苏联展览馆”金色题字，在阳光照耀下灿烂辉煌。展览馆内外，百花盛开，喷水池里，水注齐放，把整个建筑物陪衬得更加优美观壮。
    上午九时，人流开始从各条道路上涌向苏联展览馆，涌向各个展览厅。这里有来自佳木斯、包头、唐山、北京各厂矿的工人和京郊农业生产合作社的农民，有太原、济南和天津市的学生，有来自朝鲜的中国人民志愿军战士，有参加北京国庆节阅兵和中国人民解放军炮兵首届功臣代表大会的中国人民解放军指挥员战斗员，有来自延安、武汉和通县的机关干部，也有来自边疆的少数民族和来自海外的归国华侨。他们都以极大的兴趣，参观了展览会。
    在工业馆里，参观的人群都拥在苏联最新出品各种机器旁边，听说明员讲解和看操作的工人表演。一部长达七点五公尺和重有两万多斤的拉床，吸引着许多观众。操作的工人虽表演了许多次，观众们还迟迟不肯离去。当苏联工作人员在坐标镗床上表演时，观众们都站住了，有一个工人说：这台车床真了不起，一分钟能转二千八百转。咱们的车床最快才能转一千多转。北京人民印刷厂不少工人参观后，还在休息的地方开了小型座谈会，互相发表参观的感想，并表示要进一步学习苏联，来建设我们的国家。
    在工业馆东面的广场上，各种机器都动起来了，轰隆轰隆的响声振奋着参观者的心情。参观者把“顿巴斯”采煤联合机、载重量二十五吨的自动卸货汽车和巨大的掘土机围得水泄不通。在陈列建设共产主义工程的机器旁边，苏联工作人员操纵单斗掘土机，表演掘土、转向、卸土等操作，参观的建筑工人们兴奋异常。一位建筑工人说：“假如我们有了这些机器，可多省力啊！”在电气机车和两辆全金属客车旁边，排着一列很长的队伍，参观者依着次序上车参观，大家对电气机车都感到很新鲜。在农业机械广场，当“斯大林四号”自动谷物联合收割机、“斯大林六号”谷物联合收割机、拖拉机和采棉机的马达开动的时候，观众们都在四周围满了。一些农民弯着腰看采棉机器怎样采棉、吸棉。苏联工作人员和讲解人员在旁一一回答农民们所提出的问题。
    文化馆里，数千名教师和学生对三十二层高的莫斯科大学模型特别感到兴趣。北京师范大学教育系一位学生说：“苏联的今天就是我们的明天。我们要努力学习，来建设社会主义的祖国。”
    在农业馆和食品工业馆里，观众们被苏联丰富的谷物、水果和食品吸引住了。苏联到一九五四年春季止，已开垦的一千四百多万公顷荒地，出产了很多种类的春、冬小麦；其中四百五十一号南方红粒冬小麦，色泽粒大，观众们纷纷赞美。米丘林和他的后继者们所培育的苹果，种类很多，其中苹果和梨杂交的“加勒维·茴香”苹果，一斤重的“阿波尔特·阿尔金”苹果，颜色鲜艳，香味芬芳。一位观众说：我们也要在祖国的土地上生产出这样好、这样大的苹果来。
    许多观众参观后都在感想录上留下了自己的意见。一个姓王的观众写道：我在展览会上看到了苏联人民在苏联共产党领导下艰苦斗争和辛勤劳动所获得的幸福，更增加了我为幸福生活而奋斗的坚强信心。”一个来自鞍山的参观者在看了工业馆后，写下了一首诗，他写道：“我决心贡献出全付力量，去把厂房一座座兴建，把机器一件件安装；让钢铁把祖国的工业之花养育，让祖国建设得也像苏联那样辉煌。”一个人民解放军战士写道：建设吧，我的祖国！我将永远保卫着您！
    展览会所属的“莫斯科”餐厅，今天正式营业，它以莫斯科风味的丰盛菜肴接待客人；电影馆今天放映了四场，包括“科学与技术”、“农业新闻”、“里海石油工人的忘我劳动”等纪录片。
    下午六时，苏联展览馆灯光齐放，观众还恋恋不舍的不愿离去。
