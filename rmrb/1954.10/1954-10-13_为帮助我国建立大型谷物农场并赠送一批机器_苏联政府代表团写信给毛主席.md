To Chairman Mao, dear Comrade Mao Zedong:
Currently, in order to greatly increase grain production and, on this basis, develop all agricultural production sectors, the Soviet Union is implementing a massive plan to reclaim virgin and fallow land. As the experience of large-scale reclamation of virgin land has shown, the most suitable way to carry out this work is to organize state-owned grain farms.
In view of the fact that the People's Republic of China is beginning to carry out the work of reclaiming virgin and fallow land, and in order to show the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are willing to present to the Chinese people, on behalf of the Soviet people, the machines and equipment necessary to organize a state-owned grain farm with a sown area of 20,000 hectares.
To equip such a state-owned grain farm, we are allocating: 30 C-80 crawler tractors, 64 ДТ-54 crawler tractors, 4 Belarus tillage tractors, 100 grain combine harvesters, 30 trucks, 4 gasoline trucks, 4 refueling trucks, 2 mobile repair trucks, 9 light vehicles, 10 motorcycles with sidecars, 6 single-axle trailers, 8 double-axle trailers, 128 mechanical plows, 120 mechanical grain drills, 100 cultivators and heavy harrows, 1,600 harrows, 16 grain cleaning machines, 16 mowers, 14 various machine tools for equipment repair shops, 2 sets of electric welding equipment, equipment for a 220-kilowatt power station, 13 radio stations of various brands, a 100-number telephone switchboard, and one mobile film projection unit.

During the period of organizing the state-owned grain farm and familiarizing ourselves with farm production in the first year, in order to provide organizational and technical assistance in the construction and management of the state-owned grain farm, we are prepared to send a group of Soviet experts (one state farm manager, one chief agronomist of the state-owned grain farm, one chief mechanical engineer, one director of the repair shop, several agronomists and mechanics from various departments, and one chief accountant) to the People's Republic of China as advisors, so that the Chinese staff leading this state-owned grain farm and the Soviet experts can, together, master the technology and management methods of large-scale grain farms in the shortest possible time.

The living expenses of the above-mentioned experts will be borne by the Soviet Union.

We hope that the establishment of this state-owned grain farm will help China's agriculture, apply the Soviet experience in reclaiming virgin and fallow land in the People's Republic of China, and contribute to the further consolidation of the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples.

    苏联政府代表团写信给毛主席亲爱的毛泽东同志：
    目前在苏联为了大量增加谷物生产和在这一基础上发展所有的农业生产部门，正实现着开垦生荒地和熟荒地的巨大计划。正如大规模开垦生荒地的经验所表明，进行这一工作最适宜的方式是组织国营谷物农场。
    我们鉴于中华人民共和国正开始进行开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作，并且愿意把苏联在这一方面积累的经验介绍出来，以表示中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊和纪念中华人民共和国成立五周年，特请你们接受苏联人民赠给中国人民的、为组织拥有两万公顷播种面积的国营谷物农场所必需的机器和设备。
    为装备这样一个国营谷物农场，现拨出：C—八○履带式拖拉机三十架，ДТ—五四履带式拖拉机六十四架，“别洛露西”耕耘拖拉机四架，谷物联合收割机一百架，载重汽车三十辆，汽油车四辆，加油车四辆，流动修理车两辆，轻便汽车九辆，带侧座的摩托车十辆，单轴拖车六辆，双轴拖车八辆，机力犁一百二十八个，机力谷物播种机一百二十架，耕耘机和粗耕机一百架，耙一千六百个，净谷机十六架，割草机十六架，设备修理厂的各种机床十四台，电焊设备两套，二百二十瓩发电站的设备，各种牌子的无线电台十三个，拥有一百号码的电话总机一个，流动电影放映设备一部。　　在组织国营谷物农场时期和熟悉农场生产的第一年，我们为了在建设和管理国营谷物农场方面给以组织上和技术上的帮助，准备派遣一批苏联专家（国营农场经理一人、国营谷物农场的农艺总技师一人、机械总工程师一人、修理厂主任一人、各部门的农艺技师和机械师若干人、及总会计师一人）到中华人民共和国充任顾问，使领导这个国营谷物农场的中国工作人员和苏联专家一起在最短期间内掌握技术和大型谷物农场的管理方法。　　上述专家的生活费由苏联负担。 　　我们希望这个国营谷物农场的建立能帮助中国的农业，把苏联开垦生荒地和熟荒地的经验在中华人民共和国应用，并有助于苏中两国人民友谊的进一步巩固。 　　　　　　　      苏联政府代表团　一九五四年十月十二日中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志：
    苏联政府代表团很荣幸地通知您：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府为了表示友好，决定将现在北京苏联展览馆内展览的机床和农业机器赠送给中华人民共和国政府。附清单一份。
