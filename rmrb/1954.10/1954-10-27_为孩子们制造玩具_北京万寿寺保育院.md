Making Toys for Children
Beijing Wanshou Temple Nursery

Games occupy an extremely important position in early childhood education. A child's character is mainly formed through games. Toys are indispensable companions in children's games. They not only help develop children's imagination and creativity and spark their interest in games, but are also excellent tools for ideological education and imparting knowledge. Soviet early childhood education experts have told us this time and again. However, our understanding of these advanced experiences and their application in our practical work are poor. Because we don't pay enough attention to children's outdoor activities and don't lead them well in games, nor provide appropriate toys, children often run around randomly, picking up scraps and rummaging through trash cans. With even a little lack of attention, children will take away anything they can carry. Almost every child's pocket is often filled with things they've picked up. When teachers try to return these items to the trash can for the sake of the children's cleanliness or safety, it often leads to crying or even opposition from the children against the teachers.

Of course, these phenomena are related to the insufficient role of teachers' guidance. But the lack of toys is also an important reason. How much children crave all kinds of fun things that suit their interests in their lives! We have also felt the need for toys in our practical work. However, we have never taken a positive attitude to solve this problem. We always feel that there is not enough funding to buy many toys, and it is impossible to meet the needs of the children.

In April of this year, several leaders of the nursery listened to the report "Leadership Methods for Various Games in Kindergarten" by Soviet expert Manuyilenko at Beijing Normal University. This report gave us great inspiration and encouragement, making us further understand the importance of toys in the lives of preschool children and their educational significance. We decided to call on all staff in the nursery to make toys themselves and work together to create excellent conditions for educating children.

All comrades in the nursery enthusiastically plunged into the upsurge of making toys for children. Everyone should make one item, anything is fine, and try to work collectively. Considering that some comrades do not know what kind of toys are good to make, or do not know where to start, or the toys made are not suitable for children's interests, we also called on nursery workers and teachers to cooperate with comrades from other units, with nursery workers and teachers mainly responsible for design and fine work, and other comrades doing more rough work and labor-intensive work. The materials used for making toys this time should make full use of all existing things and waste materials, mostly things that the public has available but does not use, and some are things that the comrades themselves do not use. For example, making dolls requires a lot of cotton, so we used sawdust instead. The sawdust was obtained from a factory and cost nothing. Thanks to the high degree of enthusiasm and collective wisdom of all the comrades in the nursery, we successfully completed this work in two weeks.

We made a total of 710 toys of 41 kinds for the children this time, including dolls of various sizes, imitations of Czechoslovakian-style building blocks, toys for playing with sand and water, small hospital supplies, including doctor and nurse clothing, hats, masks, ward furniture, stethoscopes, thermometers, tongue depressors, microscopes, as well as various medicines, medicine bottles, and medicine racks, wooden vehicles including jeeps, cars, carriages, airplanes, boats, geometric shapes and beads such as circles, triangles, squares, farm tools, kitchen utensils, various cloth animals, sports toys, and so on. When the children saw these toys for the first time, they exclaimed with joy and surprise: "Wow! So many toys! The teachers and uncles made such good toys for us!" How encouraging were the cheers of excitement and joy from the children! We held an exhibition of these homemade toys and invited parents to visit. The parents expressed their support for this work. During the "June 1st International Children's Day," the parents also sent many toys. Thus, combining the toys made by all our comrades, the toys sent by parents, and the large number of purchased toys, we had a large "fortune." Each class received many toys.

After the children had toys, their lives changed. They lived more happily and energetically. The children's bad habits also began to change. They are no longer interested in trash cans, and no longer fight over a small stick. The phenomenon of running around outside and picking up things randomly has also been greatly reduced. For example, in the Senior Class 2, among the 22 children (11 boys and 11 girls), fights, scratches, and bites often occurred before the toys were distributed. The children's activity level was high, the order was chaotic, and under the indoor cabinets and in the gaps of the heating pipes, there were sticks, ropes, and other things hidden everywhere. It would be cleaned up today, but there would be more tomorrow. The teachers felt very distressed. Since the distribution of the two batches of toys, the situation has gradually changed. In the past few months, the children's lives have been stable and happy, and the content of the games has become much richer. A child named Sun Tie (male, six years and ten months old), who used to love leading other children to fight or run around, became a "dad" after having dolls and doll furniture, and could take care of others thoughtfully at "home." Another example is the 22 children in Senior Class 1 (15 boys and 7 girls). Before the toys were distributed, they often ran around everywhere to find toys. One child made a bow out of bamboo skin and used a thin bamboo pole as an arrow, shooting the arrow onto another child's eyelid, nearly blinding his eye. In March and April, this class had three serious falling and collision accidents in a row. The phenomenon of the 25 children in Middle Class 3 running around was even more serious. Sometimes, in order to prevent the children from running around, the teachers would organize them to play games, but those who were unwilling to participate were forced to join, and as a result, the children found more ways to run around. The children's purpose of running around was to find toys and fun places. After having toys, the phenomenon of running around was reduced, and it was easier for the teachers to organize games, and the children participated in various games with great interest. In practice, we have further realized how important toys are for preschool children, and we have a deeper understanding of the meaning of "toys are the material center of games" as pointed out by the advanced Soviet educational theory. We have also seen that children can develop an all-round personality when they use toys in games.

Our work proves that it is entirely possible to learn the advanced Soviet pre-school education theory and practical experience, and combine it with our specific circumstances and apply it to practical work. The idea that we cannot apply the educational theory we have learned to practical work because we do not have the same material conditions or educational level as the Soviet Union is wrong. In this self-made toy process, all of our comrades also took a vivid labor education class. Our collective labor has yielded rich harvests. Facts prove that as long as we work, we can change the material conditions in our work. Of course, having toys does not solve all problems. This is only a small point of the Soviet pre-school education work experience, and we should learn from the advanced Soviet experience in an all-round way. Under the leadership of the Party and superiors, and relying on the efforts of all comrades, we must constantly create excellent environments and conditions for the children and do a good job in the glorious and arduous task of cultivating the new generation.

    为孩子们制造玩具
    北京万寿寺保育院
    游戏在幼儿教育中，占着极重要的地位。幼儿的品格，主要是在游戏中形成的。而玩具是幼儿游戏中不可缺少的伴侣，它不仅能帮助发展幼儿的想像力和创造力，引起幼儿对游戏的兴趣，同时也是对幼儿进行思想教育和传授知识的良好工具。这是苏联幼儿教育专家曾不止一次地告诉过我们的。可是，我们对这些先进经验的体会，和在实际工作中的运用都很差。由于我们不够重视孩子们的户外活动，没有很好地领导他们进行游戏并给予适当的玩具，因此孩子们常常乱跑，到处拣破烂东西，翻垃圾箱。稍微注意得不周到一点，孩子们就会把拿得动的东西都拿着走。几乎每个孩子的口袋里常常是装满了拣来的东西。教养员为了孩子们的干净或安全，要把这些东西送回垃圾箱去，便会发生孩子哭闹甚至同阿姨对立的现象。
    当然，这些现象同教养员的主导作用发挥得不够是有关系的。但缺乏玩具也是一个重要原因。孩子们在生活中是多么渴望着有合乎自己兴趣的各种各样好玩的东西啊！我们在实际工作中也感觉到了玩具的需要。可是，我们始终没有采取积极的态度来解决这个问题。总觉得经费少，不能买很多玩具，要满足孩子们的需要是办不到的。
    今年四月间，保育院的几位领导同志到北京师范大学旁听了苏联专家玛弩依连柯的“幼儿园各种游戏的领导方法”的报告。这个报告给予我们极大的启发和鼓舞，使我们进一步懂得了玩具在学龄前儿童生活中的重要性和它的教育意义。我们决定号召全院工作人员，自己制造玩具，共同来为创造教育孩子们的优良条件而努力。
    保育院全体同志都热情地卷入了为孩子制造玩具的热潮中。每个人作一件，作什么都可以，尽可能集体地来作。考虑到有些同志不懂得作什么玩具好，无从下手，或作出来的玩具不适合幼儿的兴趣，我们还号召保育员和教养员同其他单位的同志分工合作，保育员和教养员主要担任设计工作和细活，另外一些同志则多做一些粗活和出力多的工作。这次制造玩具所用的材料，尽量利用一切现有的东西和废物，大多是公家现有不用的东西，部分是同志们自己不用的东西。例如，作娃娃要用很多棉花，我们便改用锯末来代替，锯末是向工厂要的，一个钱也没花。由于全院同志高度地发挥了积极性和集体智慧，我们在两个星期中顺利地完成了这一工作。
    我们这次一共为孩子们制造了四十一种共计七百一十件玩具，其中有各种大小不同的娃娃，有仿制捷克斯洛伐克式积木，有玩沙土和水的玩具，有小医院用品，包括大夫、护士的服装、帽子、口罩、病房家具、听诊器、体温表、压舌板、显微镜以及各种药品、药瓶和药架，有木制交通工具包括吉普车、大小汽车、马车、飞机、小船等，有几何形体和串珠如圆形、三角形、正方形，有农具，有厨房用具，有各种布制的小动物，有体育运动玩具，等等。孩子们第一次看见这些玩具时，都喜悦而惊奇地叫嚷起来：“啊呀！这么多玩具！阿姨、叔叔给我们作的玩具真好呀！”孩子们这种兴奋愉快的欢呼声，是如何地鼓舞了我们！我们曾将这些自制玩具举行了一次展览会，邀请家长来参观。家长们对于这个工作都表示赞助和支持。“六一国际儿童节”的时候，家长们也送来了许多玩具。这样，把我们全体同志制造的玩具，家长送来的玩具，以及大批购买的玩具合在一起，我们就有了一笔很大的“财产”。每个班都分到了不少玩具。
    孩子们有了玩具以后，生活中起了变化。他们生活得更愉快、更有生气了。孩子们那些不好的习惯，也开始有了改变。他们对垃圾箱已不感兴趣，也不再因争夺一个小棍打起架来，到外面乱跑、胡拣东西的现象也大大减少。例如大二班的二十二个孩子（男孩子十一人，女孩子十一人），在没有发玩具前，打架、抓伤、咬伤的现象经常发生，孩子们的活动量很大，秩序很乱，室内柜子底下，暖气管的缝里，到处都藏的是木棒、绳子之类的东西，今天清理了明天还会有。教养员感到很苦恼。自从发下两批玩具后，情况就逐渐改变过来。这几个月来，孩子们的生活是稳定而愉快的，游戏的内容丰富多了。有个小朋友叫孙铁（男、六岁零十个月），原先最爱领导其他小朋友打架或乱跑，有了娃娃和娃娃家具以后，他当起“爸爸”来，在“家”里能周到地照顾别人。又如大一班的二十二个孩子（男孩子十五人，女孩子七人），在没有发玩具以前，常常到处乱跑，自己找玩具，曾有一个小朋友用竹皮作了一个弓，用细竹竿作箭，把箭射到另一个小朋友的眼皮上，险些把眼睛射坏了。三四月份这个班曾连续发生三次严重的跌伤碰伤事故。中三班的二十五个孩子乱跑的现象更是严重。有时教养员为了不让孩子们乱跑，组织他们游戏，那些不愿意参加的，也强迫他们参加，结果，孩子们乱跑的方法更多了。孩子们乱跑的目的是在找玩具，找好玩的地方，有了玩具以后，乱跑的现象减少了，教养员也就比较容易地把游戏组织起来，孩子们也很有兴味地来参加各种游戏了。我们在实践中进一步地体会到了玩具对于学龄前的儿童是如何重要，更深刻地体会到了苏联先进教育理论所指出的“玩具是游戏的物质中心”的意义。我们也看到了，孩子们在游戏中使用玩具，就能培养他们全面发展的性格。
    我们的工作证明了，学习苏联先进的学前教育的理论知识和实际经验，结合我们的具体情况，把它运用到实际工作中去是完全可能的。那种强调没有苏联那样的物质条件或教育水平，因此就不能将学到的教育理论知识运用到实际中去的说法是错误的。在这一次自制玩具的过程中，我们全体同志也上了一堂生动的劳动教育课，我们集体的劳动，得到了丰富的收获，事实证明，只要劳动就能改变我们工作中的物质条件。自然，有了玩具并不是就解决了一切问题，这仅仅是苏联学前教育工作经验当中的一点，而我们应当全面地学习苏联先进经验。在党和上级的领导下，依靠全体同志们的努力，我们要不断地为孩子们创造优良的环境和条件，作好培养新生一代的光荣而艰巨的工作。
