    Wuhan People Overcame the Greatest Flood in History
    The Party Led the People of Wuhan to Overcome the Flood
  　Shi Rong
    This summer, many areas were threatened by extraordinary floods. Wuhan, located at the confluence of the waters of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, faced a particularly tense struggle. The Party organization and the people of Wuhan lacked experience in fighting such a large flood; and the tragic situation of the 1931 flood, when Wuhan was submerged for more than four months under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, was still fresh in the minds of some citizens. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recognized the severity of the threat posed by the flood to the national construction and the lives and property of the people in the Wuhan area, the complexity and arduousness of the struggle, and that this struggle was an extremely serious test for the Party organization and the people of Wuhan. Only by relying on the unity of the entire Party, resolutely implementing the instructions of the higher Party committee, deeply mobilizing the masses, and developing the revolutionary initiative of the masses, could they overcome numerous difficulties and finally defeat the flood, ensuring the safety of Wuhan.
    In the process of the battle, the Party carried out a series of mobilization and organizational tasks.
    In the early stage of flood prevention, when the situation was not yet very serious, some cadres and masses had a paralyzing and侥幸 (jiaoxing - "luckily") mentality; while some older people showed panic and lacked confidence that the Party could lead the people to overcome the flood. At this time, according to the instructions of the higher authorities, the Municipal Party Committee, based on the scientific analysis of water conditions and rainfall, and referring to historical experience, focused on pointing out the seriousness of the flood situation, pointing out that paralysis and a侥幸 mentality were harmful, and that preparations must be made from the most serious situation to ensure preparedness; at the same time, it also conducted education on "two systems, two situations" for cadres and the masses, pointing out the basic conditions for victory, and explaining the basic principle that "man can conquer nature."
    When the thinking of cadres and the masses had already changed and the flood was approaching or even exceeding the highest water level in 1931, the main danger was the panic and pessimistic emotions that some cadres and masses might have and had already developed in the face of the serious threat of the flood. According to the development of the objective and subjective situation, the Party, on the one hand, explained the severity of the situation, pointing out that the struggle had entered a critical stage of the decisive battle; at the same time, it explained that the basic favorable conditions for the struggle, especially the subjective conditions, had significantly increased, and that it was possible to defeat the flood; it called on the people of the city to further mobilize urgently, make persistent efforts, fight bravely, and strive for victory. Subsequently, the Party and the People's Government, according to the instructions of the higher authorities, mobilized the people of the city to make the necessary preparations under unified planning and unified command, so that even in the event of an accident, losses could be avoided or reduced. The Party's timely and clear explanation of the situation of the struggle and the conditions for victory to cadres and the masses, as well as the spirit of the Party and the People's Government being responsible to the people and sharing life and death with the people, greatly inspired the morale of the people, especially the flood prevention army.
    When the flood's rising trend weakened, especially when the flood began to recede from its highest level, the Party, according to the laws of past struggles and the ideological conditions of cadres and the masses, timely sounded the alarm to the entire Party, especially the responsible cadres of the Party, pointing out the severity of the threat of floods and wind and waves during the receding period, pointing out that the greatest danger in the new situation of struggle was the complacency and slackness that might occur among some cadres and the masses, and that it was necessary to carry forward the fighting spirit of "never withdraw troops without complete victory," and oppose the ideological style of complacency and hasty withdrawal. At the same time, it instructed Party organizations at all levels to guide the masses to fully carry out the merit campaign, do a good job in Party and League building, and do a good job in safety and hygiene, so as to ensure that the fighting force could always maintain a full and tense mood from all aspects of ideology, organization, and life, achieve a complete victory in flood prevention, and make ideological preparations for the new combat tasks of carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the next step.
    In the course of the flood prevention struggle, the people more deeply, specifically, and intimately realized that the interests of the Party and the interests of the people are consistent, and that the Party and the People's Government are connected to the people by flesh and blood. The people have received direction, encouragement, and strength from the leadership of the Party. The close unity and fighting of the Party and the people ensured that any dangers and difficulties could be overcome in the flood prevention struggle, and that victory could be achieved from victory. Yang Mingcong, a construction worker and a first-class flood prevention hero, once said the following moving passage. He said: "Before the water flooded, the Party proposed that flood prevention override everything. Before the water rose, the dikes were built. I thought it was a bit superfluous; but the Party seemed to know how much the water was going to rise, and when the water rose, the dikes had already been built and heightened. After building the dikes, a rescue team was set up, and I didn't understand it at first. Later I understood, if there was no rescue, it would be terrible. ... In the end, the Party proposed to overcome pride, complacency, and slackness. Without the Party, everything would have been over long ago!"
    The victory of the flood prevention struggle proved that the unity of the Party and the unity of the Party and the people can withstand any severe test. Unlimited loyalty to the revolutionary cause, safeguarding the socialist construction of the country, and protecting the lives and property of the people have become a great force for mobilizing the entire Party and the masses to establish heroic feats. The lofty qualities of patriotism, collectivism, and revolutionary heroism of the people have been greatly developed, and the creative wisdom and advanced science and technology of the masses have been widely adopted and applied; the heroes, meritorious people, and their advanced ideas and deeds that emerged in the struggle have been widely disseminated and become models for the masses to learn from.
    In the flood prevention struggle, Communist Party members, whether on the front line of the levee or in the rear, persistently stood at the forefront of the struggle, uniting the masses, working hard, being brave and calm, and showing the noble qualities and combat style of not fearing hardships and dangers, leading the masses and creating countless moving deeds. Among them, there are first-class meritorious people like Wang Wancang, Luo Guangtian, Wang Maoshan, Yang Mingcong, Le Jinyuan, and Lu Youzhi from the People's Liberation Army, workers, farmers, and women; meritorious martyrs like Yan Zhongliang and Yi Jinyuan, who sacrificed themselves to protect the masses and comrades-in-arms, and Jia Mingwu, who sacrificed himself to rescue a major sewer leak; and heroes and heroines like Yuan Xiuzhen and Han Youmei, who were nurtured and educated by the Party after liberation. In the flood prevention struggle, more than 8,000 people in the city gloriously joined the Communist Party of China; and more than 15,000 people gloriously joined the Communist Youth League.
    The improvement of the socialist ideological consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and people, the consolidation and expansion of Party and League organizations and fighting forces, and the growth of advanced figures and outstanding cadres among the masses have greatly promoted the victory of the flood prevention struggle, and have far-reaching significance for the cause of national socialist construction in the Wuhan area.
    In the flood prevention struggle, the Party organization of Wuhan City was tested and tempered, and the leadership level of the Party organization of Wuhan City was also improved. The Party organization of Wuhan City drew inexhaustible strength from the unity of the Party, the unity of the working class, the unity of the working people, and the unity of the people of the whole country.
    Based on Marxist-Leninist theory, based on the knowledge of the laws of social development and the understanding of the laws of nature, the Party clearly recognized the environment, understood the process and trend of the development of events, scientifically predicted the occurrence of events, and thus formulated correct guidelines and policies, put forward clear combat slogans for each different period, to guide and lead the masses, concentrate forces, and achieve the victory of the flood prevention struggle. During this period, the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the instructions and support of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPC at several critical moments of the struggle, the strong support of the whole country in terms of materials and manpower, and the powerful coordination of flood diversion in several rural areas of Hubei, fully guaranteed the materials and manpower needed for flood prevention in Wuhan, guaranteed that the dikes of Wuhan won time in the face of the rapid rise of the flood, so that the Party organization and the people of Wuhan City could win successive victories in the fight against the flood, and did not lose confidence even in the most serious and dangerous situation.
    In the struggle, the Party resolutely relied on the masses, trusted the masses, and concentrated the wisdom and strength of the masses. The Party drew rich knowledge and infinite strength from the continuous improvement of the ideological consciousness and work level of the masses, from the continuous development of the enthusiasm and creative wisdom of the masses in the struggle, from the masses' trust in the Party and the close unity of dependence on each other, and from the practical actions of the masses in resolutely implementing the Party's policies. Therefore, although the flood rose higher and higher, exceeding the initial estimates, although there was a lack of experience in flood prevention struggle in the early stage, and although the struggle encountered numerous dangers and difficulties, the Party's determination to struggle and confidence in victory were constantly improved and enhanced, and powerfully led the people to win a complete victory in flood prevention.
    In the course of the flood prevention struggle, the leading cadres at all levels of the Party and other leading cadres gained rich experience in all aspects of political and ideological work, administrative and business leadership, scientific and technological guidance, and mass life management from the extremely tense, arduous, and complex combat environment, from the urgent demands of the people, from the needs of the struggle, and from the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, especially in maintaining and developing the combat ideological style, in linking with reality, linking with the masses, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, have made great improvements. These have greatly strengthened the Party's leadership, strengthened the unity between the Party and the People's Government and the masses, and enhanced the prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the masses.
    The flood prevention struggle in Wuhan has been completely and finally victorious. From the joy and encouragement of victory, the Party organization and the people of Wuhan City have more deeply realized that the unity of the Party and the united struggle of the Party and the masses is a great force that is invincible. The people of the city are consolidating and developing the achievements of the flood prevention struggle with redoubled determination, confidence, and strength, responding to the call of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, fully complete the national plan, and support the disaster areas, the rural areas, and the liberation of Taiwan, and are moving from the victory of the flood prevention struggle to the new victory of increasing production and practicing economy and fully completing the national plan.

    武汉人民战胜了历史上的最大洪水
    党领导着武汉人民战胜了洪水
  　石容
    今年夏天，很多地区遭受着特大洪水的威胁。武汉地当长江中游诸水总汇，斗争更是特别紧张。武汉市的党组织和人民，都缺乏和这样大的洪水作斗争的经验；而一九三一年国民党反动统治时期洪水淹没武汉四个多月的惨状，在有些市民心中印象犹新。中共武汉市委认识到洪水对武汉地区国家建设和人民生命财产威胁的严重性，认识到斗争的复杂性和艰巨性，认识到这一场斗争对武汉市的党组织和全市人民，都是一次极其严重的考验，只有依靠全党的团结一致，坚决贯彻上级党委的指示，深入发动群众和发扬群众的革命积极性，才能够克服重重困难，最后战胜洪水，确保武汉安全。
    党在战斗过程中，进行了一系列的动员组织工作。
    防汛初期，情况还不十分严重，一部分干部和群众有麻痹侥幸心理；而有些老年人则表现恐慌，对党能够领导人民战胜洪水，缺乏信心。这时，市委根据上级指示，以对水情、雨情的科学分析，参照历史经验，着重指出汛情的严重性，指出麻痹侥幸心理是有害的，必须从最严重情况出发，作好准备，做到有备无患；同时也向干部和群众进行“两种制度，两种情况”的教育，指出胜利的基本条件，说明“人定可以胜天”的基本道理。
    在干部群众思想已有转变、洪水接近以至超过一九三一年最高水位的时候，主要危险就是在洪水严重威胁面前某些干部和群众可能产生并且已经发生的惊慌失措和消极悲观情绪。党根据主客观形势的发展，一方面说明形势严重，指出斗争已进入决战关键；同时说明斗争的基本有利条件特别是主观方面的条件，已经有了显著的增长，战胜洪水是可能的；号召全市人民进一步紧急动员起来，再接再厉，英勇战斗，争取胜利。接着，党和人民政府根据上级指示，动员全市人民，在统一计划和统一指挥下，作好必要的准备，以便即使万一出险，也可以避免或减少损失。党这样及时、清楚地将斗争形势和胜利的条件向干部和群众交代清楚，以及党和人民政府这种对人民负责到底和与人民同生死共患难的精神，更大大激励了人民群众特别是防汛大军的斗志。
    当洪水涨势转弱，特别是洪水自最高水位开始回落的时候，党根据历来斗争规律和干部、群众思想状况，又及时向全党特别是党的负责干部敲起了警钟，指出退水时期洪水和风浪威胁的严重性，指出在新的斗争形势下的最大的危险，是某些干部和群众中可能发生的骄气和松气，必须发扬“不获全胜、决不收兵”的战斗精神，反对骄傲自满、草率收兵的思想作风。同时指示各级党的组织，引导群众，全面开展立功运动，作好建党建团工作，以及作好安全卫生工作等，从思想上、组织上、生活上各个方面，保证战斗队伍能够始终保持饱满紧张情绪，取得防汛全胜，并为下一步开展增产节约运动的新的战斗任务，作好思想准备。
    在防汛斗争的历程中，人民更深刻、具体、亲切地认识到：党的利益和人民利益是一致的，党和人民政府与人民群众是血肉相联、息息相关的。人民从党的领导，得到了方向，得到了鼓舞，得到了力量。党与人民群众的亲密无间、团结战斗，就保证了在防汛斗争中能够克服任何艰险和困难，从胜利走向胜利。防汛特等功臣、建筑工人杨明聪，曾经感动地讲过下面一段话。他说：“水还没有淹到，党就提出了防汛压倒一切。水还没有涨到，就修起来了堤。我还想着有些多余；但是党就好像晓得水要涨多少一样，水涨来了，堤早就修好修高了。修了堤还搞起抢险队，我开头也不明白。后来明白了，不抢险那还得了。……末了，党又提出要克服骄傲自满、麻痹松劲。要没有党，什么都早完了！”
    防汛斗争的胜利，证明了党的团结，党和人民群众的团结，是经得住任何严重考验的。对革命事业的无限忠诚，保卫国家社会主义建设，保护人民生命财产安全，成为了动员全党和人民群众树立英勇功绩的伟大力量。人民群众的爱国主义、集体主义和革命英雄主义的崇高品质，大大地发扬起来了，群众的创造智慧和先进的科学技术，得到了广泛的采纳和运用；斗争中涌现出来的英雄、功臣和他们的先进思想、先进事迹，得到了普遍传布并成为群众学习的榜样。
    在防汛斗争中，共产党员无论在堤防前线或后方，都坚持地站在斗争前列，以团结群众，艰苦奋斗、英勇沉着，不畏艰险的高贵品质和战斗作风，带动群众，创造出无数可歌可泣的事迹。在他们中间，有像王万仓、罗光田、王茂山、杨明聪、乐金元、卢幼芝这样的来自人民解放军、工人、农民、妇女当中的特等功臣；有舍身救护群众和战友的严中良、易金元和舍身抢护下水道漏水大险的贾明武等功臣烈士；还有像袁秀珍、韩友梅这样的在解放后党抚养和教育出来的英雄儿女。在防汛斗争中、全市有八千多人光荣地参加了中国共产党；有一万五千多人光荣地参加了青年团。
    广大干部和人民群众社会主义思想觉悟的提高，党、团组织和战斗队伍的巩固和扩大，群众中先进人物和优秀干部的成长，这些都大大推动了防汛斗争的胜利，对于武汉地区国家社会主义建设事业，更有深远的意义。
    在防汛斗争中，考验了锻炼了武汉市的党组织，同时也提高了武汉市党组织的领导水平。武汉市党的组织，从党的团结，工人阶级的团结，劳动人民的团结，全国人民的团结中，汲取了无穷尽的力量。
    党依据马克思列宁主义学说，依据对社会发展规律的知识和对自然法则的认识，认清环境，了解事变发展的进程和动向，科学地预见到事变的发生，从而规定正确的方针、政策，提出各个不同时期的明确的战斗口号，用以指导和引导群众，集中力量，取得防汛斗争的胜利。这其间，党中央、中央人民政府和毛主席的指示，中共中央中南局、中共湖北省委在几次斗争关头的指示和支持，全国在物资、人力上的大力支援，和湖北若干农村分洪的有力配合，充分保证了武汉防汛所需物资及人力，保证了武汉堤防在洪水猛涨中赢得时间，使武汉市的党组织和全市人民，在和洪水搏斗中，能够获得节节胜利，即使在最严重最危急的情况下，也没有丧失信心。
    在斗争中，党坚决地依靠群众，相信群众，集中了群众的智慧和力量。党从群众思想觉悟和工作水平的不断提高中，从群众斗争积极性和创造智慧不断发扬中，从群众对党的信赖和相依为命的亲密团结中，从群众坚决贯彻党的方针的实际行动中，汲取了丰富的知识和无穷的力量。所以，虽然洪水节节上涨，超过了最初的估计，虽然初期缺乏防汛斗争经验，虽然斗争中遭遇着重重艰险和种种困难，党的斗争决心和胜利信心，却能够不断地提高和增强，并且有力地领导人民获得了防汛的完全胜利。
    在防汛斗争的历程中，党的各级领导干部以及其他领导干部，从极其紧张、艰巨而复杂的战斗环境中，从人民群众的迫切要求和斗争的需要中，从人民解放军的优良传统中，得到了政治思想工作、行政业务领导、科学技术指导以及群众生活管理等各个方面的丰富经验，特别是保持和发扬了战斗的思想作风，在联系实际、联系群众、开展批评与自我批评等方面，都有了很大的改进。这些就大大加强了党的领导力量，加强了党和人民政府同人民群众的团结，提高了党和人民政府在人民群众中的威信。
    武汉防汛斗争完全地最后地胜利了。武汉市的党的组织和全市人民，从胜利的欢欣、鼓舞中，更加深刻地认识到党的团结和党与人民群众的团结战斗，就是战无不胜的伟大力量。全市人民正以加倍的决心、信心和力量，巩固和发扬防汛斗争的成绩，响应中共武汉市委所提出的开展增产节约运动，全面完成国家计划，以支援灾区、支援农村、支援解放台湾的号召，从防汛斗争的胜利，走向新的增产节约，全面完成国家计划的胜利。
