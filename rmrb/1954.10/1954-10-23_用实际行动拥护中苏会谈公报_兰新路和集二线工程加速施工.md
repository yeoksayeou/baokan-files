    Using Practical Actions to Support the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué
    Lanxin Railway and Jier Line Projects Speed Up Construction
    The workers constructing the Lanxin Railway and the Ji (Ning) Er (Lian) line warmly support the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué. Upon hearing the news of the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué, the workers on the Lanxin Railway said, "Great! Great!" and worked diligently, determined to use the practical action of laying seventeen kilometers more of steel rails than the planned target for this year to strive to meet with the Soviet workers on the Sino-Soviet border as soon as possible. After hearing this good news, the workers of the Third Engineering Section, who are working in the Gobi Desert, held a full-section telephone conference on the 15th to study how to accelerate the construction of the Lanxin Railway. The workers at the Huangjiaquan Prefabricated Products Factory, who are rushing to produce prefabricated bridge and culvert components, became even more enthusiastic after hearing the news of the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué, and they broke their quotas one after another. Carpenter Fu Zhongmu created a new record of exceeding the quota by more than three times.
    On October 12, when the workers and cadres of the Jier Line in the Inner Mongolian grasslands heard the news of the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué from the radio, they were very excited, singing, dancing, and applauding, feeling indescribably happy. Ding Wanchen, a national railway labor model and recipient of the "Glorious Railway Worker" medal, convened a meeting of cadres above the group leader level after hearing the communiqué to study how to improve construction methods. They re-arranged the winter construction plan, put forward new measures, and expressed their determination to build the Jier line well. After the meeting, Ding Wanchen also took the initiative to urge the leading authorities to issue design documents, and went deep into the work site to inspect the work and visit the workers' living conditions, which encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for work. When the communiqué reached the workers who were laying rails towards Erenhot, they immediately proposed to increase the original speed of laying 2.8 kilometers of rail per day to 3.2 kilometers. The transportation section and the materials factory workers also made a guarantee to the rail-laying workers: "Wherever you lay the rails, we will supply them!"
    Currently, the Lanxin Railway's project west of the Wushao Ridge is proceeding intensely. In order to lay an additional seventeen kilometers of rails, the workers are actively building large and small bridges, culverts, and roadbeds. A new roadbed, both flat and solid, is constantly extending towards Xinjiang. The workers spreading ballast are also working hard to spread it quickly and well. The well-tested nailing and bridge-building team has laid the rails 245 kilometers out of Lanzhou. The workers building the Jier Line in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are overcoming difficulties and advancing rapidly. On October 21, the workers of the nailing team had laid the rails 212 kilometers out of Jining!

    用实际行动拥护中苏会谈公报
    兰新路和集二线工程加速施工
    修建兰新路和集（宁）二（连）线的职工，热烈拥护中苏会谈公报。兰新路的工人知道了中苏会谈公报的消息后，一边说：“好啊！好啊！”一边努力工作，他们决定用比今年预定计划多铺十七公里钢轨的实际行动，来争取尽快地和苏联工人在中苏国境会师。正在戈壁滩上施工的第三工程段职工听到这一喜讯后，在十五日举行了全段电话会议，研究如何加速兰新路的建设。黄家泉成品厂正在赶制桥涵成品的工人听到中苏会谈公报消息后，生产热情更加高涨，纷纷突破了定额，木工符仲木创造了超过定额三倍多的新纪录。
    十月十二日，当内蒙草原上的集二线工人、干部从广播机里听到中苏会谈的公报消息后，他们非常激动，唱呀，跳呀，鼓掌呀，真有说不出来的愉快。全国铁路劳动模范、“光荣的铁路工作者”奖章获得者、第二工程段长丁万臣听到公报后，召开了小组长以上的干部会，研究如何改进施工的办法。他们重新安排了冬季施工计划，提出了新的措施，表示坚决修好集二线。会后，丁万臣还主动到领导机关催领设计文件，并深入现场检查工作，访问工人生活情况，鼓舞了工人们的劳动热情。公报传到正向二连方面铺轨的工人那里，他们立即提出要把原来每天铺轨二点八公里的速度提高到三点二公里。运输科、材料厂职工也向铺轨工人提出保证：“你们铺到哪里，我们就供应到哪里！”
    现在，兰新路乌鞘岭以西的工程正在紧张进行。工人们为了多铺轨十七公里，正积极修筑大小桥梁、涵洞和路基。一条又平坦、又结实的新路基，正向新疆方面不断延伸过去。撒道床石碴的工人们也在努力地工作，争取撒得又快又好。久经考验的钉道架桥队的职工，已把钢轨铺出兰州二百四十五公里。在内蒙古自治区修建集二线的职工们正战胜困难飞跃地前进。十月二十一日，钉道队的工人已把钢轨铺出集宁二百一十二公里！
