    On the Shores of the Azov Sea
    ——Notes from a Visit to Ukraine, Part 12
    By Our Correspondent　Lǐ Hé
    From the Donbas to the Azov Sea in the south, there are many roads. The most convenient is from Stalino to Zhdanov. A railway of about one hundred kilometers connects these two cities. We took a car on the flat asphalt road at a speed of sixty kilometers per hour, arriving in Zhdanov from Stalino in the early morning; and returning to Stalino from Zhdanov at night.

    Zhdanov is located on the coast of the Azov Sea. It is the birthplace of Comrade Zhdanov. Originally named Mariupol, it was renamed in 1948 to commemorate this outstanding activist of the Soviet Communist Party. It is another steel industrial center in southern Soviet Union. Among the many factories built along the coast, the "Azov Steel" plant is one of the largest steel plants in the Soviet Union. As soon as we arrived in Zhdanov, we stepped into the gate of this factory.

    "Azov Steel" plant was established on the north shore of the Azov Sea during the First Five-Year Plan in 1931. This was not accidental. This factory uses coal from the Donbas, which arrives by rail from the north, to smelt iron ore from Kerch, which arrives by sea from the south. Therefore, simultaneously with the construction of the steel plant, the Kames-Burun Iron Ore Joint Enterprise was built on the Kerch Peninsula. It carries out mining, beneficiation, and sintering operations.

    Before the war, the steel plant had built a total of four blast furnaces, two of which were the largest in Ukraine; six huge tilting open-hearth furnaces, each capable of producing five hundred tons of steel per day and night; and was building one of the largest rolling mills in Europe. The factory suffered severe damage from the Hitler bandits during the war. After the war, the Soviet Union rapidly restored and developed the factory using bold methods and the latest technology. For example, after the foundation of the No. 4 blast furnace was destroyed, the furnace body sank three and a half meters, deviated from the axis by one point three meters, and tilted to twenty degrees. During the repair, a two-hundred-ton hydraulic crane was used to level the one-thousand-two-hundred-ton blast furnace without dismantling it, then placed it on the track, moved, lifted, and restored to its original position. It was completed in less than six days and nights. According to the usual method of dismantling and reassembling, this would have taken more than half a year. The engineers who proposed this method won the Stalin Prize because this method made a significant contribution to the recovery of the southern steel industry. The existing blast furnaces in the steel plant are the largest in Europe.

    The tilting open-hearth furnace is a characteristic of the "Azov Steel" plant. In the open-hearth furnace workshop, seeing a row of open-hearth furnaces, taller than usual, it didn't seem anything special. After a while, the steelworkers operated the switch on the console, and the entire open-hearth furnace slowly tilted towards the steel ladle, pouring out some of the slag, and then slowly straightened up. Previously, I had heard that the "Azov Steel" plant had such a unique open-hearth furnace, its advantages are: convenient slag removal and steel pouring; it can discharge steel in sections, so its volume can be as large as five or six hundred tons. According to the workshop engineer Yarkhangelsky: Kerch iron ore contains a lot of phosphorus. Before refining them into steel, a lot of phosphorus-containing slag must be removed (this phosphorus slag can be used as fertilizer for farmland), so such a tilting open-hearth furnace is needed. The open-hearth furnace can swing forward and backward.

    In the steel plant, we saw one of the largest rail rolling workshops in the Soviet Union. The workshop is one point one kilometers long, spacious, bright, and well-ventilated. Steel ingots are rolled into long rails on mechanized rail rolling machines, and then cut into two sections. The workshop is highly mechanized, with only a few people operating the machines.

    The workers of the steel plant are actively producing and living a good life. In the first half of the year, the workers of the No. 3 blast furnace overproduced four thousand seven hundred and sixty-five tons of pig iron; the workers of the No. 3 and No. 10 open-hearth furnaces overproduced two thousand five hundred tons of steel. When we visited, the entire factory was working hard to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule, better use equipment, improve product quality and reduce product costs. In the first half of the year, the steel plant built seven thousand eight hundred square meters of housing, the second section of the trolleybus, a maternity room, a clinic, a night secondary technical school, a sports field, three stores and two canteens. About two hundred employees have personal cars and motorcycles. In the first half of the year, more than seven hundred people had been to sanatoriums and rest homes.

    Not far from the steel plant is a wharf. It is used by the steel plant to transport iron ore, sinter, and products. There is also a large wharf on the coast. There are many ships and busy cranes. Zhdanov is an important port in southern Ukraine. Coal, steel, grain, and salt are transported from the Donbas through this port to various ports in the Azov Sea and the Black Sea. The manganese ore of Chiatura (in the Georgian Republic) and the cement of Novorossiysk (in the Krasnodar Krai) needed by the Donbas and the steel industry in southern Ukraine are imported through this port.

    The year before last, I saw the southeastern Azov Sea from the Kuban agricultural area, and now I see the northern Azov Sea from the Donbas industrial area. The Azov Sea is a large bay of the Black Sea, connected to the Black Sea through the Kerch Strait. After the Volga-Don Canal was opened, it added new routes. The Azov Sea water is not deep, and it receives water from the Don River and the Kuban River, so its water is not very salty. It produces a lot of fish. It is said that eighty kilograms of fish can be caught from one hectare (ten thousand square meters) of sea surface, and the area of ​​the Azov Sea is thirty-seven to thirty-eight thousand square kilometers.

    We cruised in a boat on the light blue Azov Sea. From the sea, you can see the coast of Zhdanov: one side is developing factories, and the other side is developing sanatoriums. In front of a row of beautiful sanatorium buildings, crossing the road, are continuous bathing beaches. Many workers and their families swim, boat, sunbathe, and rest on the beach. The Soviets do not let go of the coast to build sanatoriums. There are sanatoriums for metallurgical workers and sanatoriums for coal miners.

    We went to a sanatorium run by the Central Committee of the Soviet Coal Miners' Union. The Soviet Coal Miners' Union runs four hundred sanatoriums and rest homes across the country. Some Soviet sanatorium areas such as Sochi and Kislovodsk have miners' sanatoriums. The sanatorium we saw has two hundred and thirty-five beds. Workers can rest and receive medical treatment here for twenty-eight days. The infirmary is equipped with various new medical devices, which can effectively treat people suffering from arthritis, neurasthenia and other chronic diseases with mud therapy, hydrotherapy, and electrotherapy. Two buildings, one for men and one for women. The rooms lead to the terrace, and when you open the door, you can see the vast sea. The sanatorium has its own seawater bathing beach. The food is plentiful and nutritious. According to the director of the medical center, the workers gained an average of three point one kilograms of weight after recuperation, sixty percent gained more than three kilograms, and some gained up to eight kilograms. In the garden of the medical center, when the miners were just waking up from their nap, we met several sun-tanned workers playing dominoes. They came from the Moscow Oblast coal mines, the Molotov Oblast coal mines, the northern Pechora coal mines, and the nearby Makeyevka coal mines. Some gained three kilograms, and some gained five kilograms. They are very satisfied with their recuperation results. They said:
  After a good rest once a year, work efficiency is greatly improved.

    In the conversation with these healthy and happy miners, I couldn't help but recall the models and pictures of the inhuman working conditions and tragic lives of the Donbas miners before the revolution seen in the Zhdanov City Museum. At that time, Donbas miners used pickaxes and claw bars to dig coal in low, stuffy, dark pits supported by a few wooden pillars, which could collapse at any time. The coal baskets were tied to the miner's waist with ropes, and he crawled to transport them. The miners lived in dilapidated small houses. And now, Donbas miners use machines to excavate tunnels, mine coal, and transport coal. There is a special miner
  Work Safety Research Institute, and there are comfortable miner sanatoriums. The mining life under that exploitative system has been forever buried in the historical museum in socialist Soviet Union.

    在亚速夫海滨
    ——乌克兰访问记之十二
    本报记者　李　何
    从顿巴斯通达南面的亚速夫海，有许多条道路。其中最近便的，是由斯大林诺市到日丹诺夫市。大约一百公里的铁路把这两个城市联接起来。我们乘着汽车，在平坦的柏油公路上，以每小时六十公里的速度，清晨从斯大林诺市赶到了日丹诺夫市；黑夜又从日丹诺夫市回到了斯大林诺市。
    日丹诺夫市就在亚速夫海海滨。它是日丹诺夫同志出生的地方，原名为马留乌波尔，一九四八年为纪念这位苏联共产党杰出的活动家才改了名。它是苏联南方又一个钢铁工业中心。在沿着海滨建立的许多工厂中，“亚速夫钢铁”厂是苏联最大的钢铁厂之一。我们一到日丹诺夫市，就跨进了这个工厂的大门。
    “亚速夫钢铁”厂在一九三一年五年计划时期，建立在亚速夫海北岸。这不是偶然的。这个工厂使用着从北面铁路来的顿巴斯的煤，冶炼从南面海路来的刻赤的铁矿。所以与建设钢铁厂同时，在刻赤半岛建设了卡梅石·布伦铁矿联合企业。它进行采矿、选矿和烧结工作。
    在战前，钢铁厂总共建设了四个高炉，其中两个是乌克兰最大的；建设了六个巨大的能够摆动的平炉，每个炉一昼夜能炼五百吨钢；并且建设着欧洲最大的轧钢车间之一。工厂在战时受到了希特勒匪徒的严重破坏。战后，苏联运用勇敢的方法和最新技术迅速恢复和发展了这个工厂。例如，第四号高炉的基础被破坏后，炉身下沉三公尺半，离开轴心一点三公尺，倾斜到二十度。在修复时候，用二百吨的水压起重机，把一千二百吨的高炉没有经过拆装就挪平了，然后放在轨道上，移动，举起，恢复到原位置。不到六昼夜就完工。而按照平常拆开再安装的方法，这需要半年以上时间。提出这个方法的工程师们，因为这个方法对于恢复南方钢铁工业有重大贡献，获得了斯大林奖金。钢铁厂现有的几个高炉，是欧洲最大的。
    能够摆动的平炉，是“亚速夫钢铁”厂的特色。在平炉车间，看到一列平炉，比平常的高大，似乎没有什么特别。一会儿，炼钢工人在操纵台开动了电门，一座平炉全身向盛钢桶那一面缓缓地倾斜，倒出了一部分渣，又缓缓地摆正了。以前，就听说“亚速夫钢铁”厂有这样与众不同的平炉，它的长处是：排渣和倒钢方便；可以一部分一部分地出钢，所以它的容积可以大到五、六百吨。据车间工程师亚尔汉格尔斯基谈：刻赤铁矿矿石含磷很多。把它们炼成钢之前，要排出很多含磷的渣（这些磷渣可以用作农田肥料），所以需要这样能摆动的平炉。平炉可以往前和往后摆动。
    在钢铁厂，我们看到了一个苏联最大的轧轨车间。车间长到一点一公里，宽敞、明亮、空气流通。钢锭在机械化的轧轨机上轧成长轨，然后切成两段。车间高度地机械化，只有几个人在操纵机器。
    钢铁厂的工人积极地生产着，美好地生活着。在上半年，第三号高炉工人超额多炼了四千七百六十五吨生铁；第三号和第十号平炉工人超额多炼了二千五百吨钢。我们访问的时候，全厂职工正在努力提前完成今年生产计划，更好地使用设备，提高产品质量和减低产品成本。在上半年，钢铁厂建筑了七千八百平方公尺住宅、第二部分无轨电车、产房、诊疗所、夜间中等技术学校、运动场、三个商店和两个食堂。约二百个职工有个人的小汽车和摩托车。在上半年，已经有七百多人到过疗养所和休养所。
    离钢铁厂不远有一座码头。它是钢铁厂运进铁矿、烧结矿和运出产品用的。在海滨还有很大的码头。那里麇集着船只和忙碌着的起重机。日丹诺夫市是乌克兰南部的重要港口。煤、钢铁、谷物和盐，从顿巴斯经过这个港口运到亚速夫海和黑海各港口去。顿巴斯和乌克兰南部钢铁工业所需要的齐亚土提（在格鲁吉亚共和国）的锰矿，诺沃露西斯克（在克提斯诺达尔边疆）的水泥，经过这个港口输进来。
    前年从库班农业区看到东南部的亚速夫海，而现在从顿巴斯的工业区看到北部的亚速夫海。亚速夫海是黑海的大海湾，经过刻赤海峡通到黑海。伏尔加河和顿河之间的运河开辟之后，它增加了新航线。亚速夫海海水不深，又接受着顿河和库班河等河水，所以它的水也不怎么咸。它出产很多的鱼。据说，从一公顷（一万平方米）海面可以捕到八十公斤鱼，而亚速夫海的面积有三万七、八千平方公里。
    我们乘艇在浅蓝色的亚速夫海海面游览。从海面可以看到日丹诺夫市的海滨：一边发展着工厂，另一边发展着疗养所。在一排漂亮的疗养所建筑物前面，越过公路，是连绵不绝的浴场。许多劳动者和他们的家属在海边游泳、划船，在沙滩上晒太阳、休息。苏联人是不放过海滨来建立疗养所的。这里有冶金工人的疗养所，也有煤矿工人的疗养所。
    我们到了一座苏联煤矿工会中央委员会办的疗养所。苏联煤矿工会在全国办有四百个疗养所和休养所。像索琪、基斯洛沃德斯克一些苏联疗养区都有矿工疗养所。我们看的疗养所，有二百三十五个床位。工人可以在这里休息和医疗二十八天。医务室里摆着各种新式的医疗器械，能对患关节炎、神经衰弱和其他慢性疾病的人进行有效的泥疗、水疗、电疗。两座楼，一座住男的，一座住女的。房间通到露台，打开门就见到广阔的海。疗养所有自己的海水浴场。伙食量多又有营养。据医疗所所长说，工人休养后体重平均增加了三点一公斤，百分之六十在三公斤以上，有的增加到八公斤。在矿工午睡初醒的时候，在医疗所的花园里，我们遇见几位晒得黝黑的工人在玩骨牌。他们来自莫斯科州煤矿、莫洛托夫州煤矿、北方彼楚拉煤矿和不远的马克耶夫卡煤矿。有的体重增加了三公斤，有的增加了五公斤。他们很满意自己的休养成绩。他们说：
  一年一次很好地休养以后，工作效率大大提高。
    和这些健康的愉快的矿工们的谈话当中，我不禁想起在日丹诺夫市博物馆所见的革命以前顿巴斯矿工那种非人劳动条件和悲惨生活的模型和图片。当时顿巴斯矿工在几根木柱支撑的、低矮、闷人、黑暗、随时都会坍塌的掌子里，用鹤嘴锄、丁字铁镐凿煤。把煤筐用绳子系在矿工的腰上，由他爬行拉运。矿工们住的是破烂的小房。而现在，顿巴斯矿工用机器开凿巷道、采煤和运煤，有专门的矿工
  工作安全研究院，有舒适的矿工疗养所。那种剥削制度下的矿工生涯，在社会主义苏联，是永远被埋葬在历史博物馆中去了。
