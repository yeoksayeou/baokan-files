To Comrade Otto Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic:

Respected Premier,

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, I would like to extend warm congratulations from the government of the People's Republic of China to the government of the German Democratic Republic and the German people. I wish the German people even greater achievements in their just cause of striving for the unification, peace, democracy, and independence of their motherland, and in their efforts to continuously improve the material and cultural life of the working people. I wish that the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Germany will be increasingly consolidated and developed in the common struggle to defend world peace and further ease international tensions.

Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
October 5, 1954
