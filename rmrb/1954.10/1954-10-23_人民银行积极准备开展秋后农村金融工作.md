Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: To cooperate with the autumn grain and cotton procurement and the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, the People's Bank of China system is preparing to carry out autumn rural financial work.

This autumn, rural credit cooperative organizations will develop greatly. In recent months, the People's Bank of China in major regions and provinces have held professional credit cooperation conferences to summarize work and formulate autumn and winter development guidelines and plans based on local conditions. The provinces in East China plan to train more than 105,000 cadres and develop more than 22,700 to 24,700 credit cooperatives (departments) by the end of the year. The Shaanxi Branch proposed in September to develop more than 2,700 new cooperatives by the end of the year. The Northeast District Bank proposed in August to double the number of credit cooperatives this year on the basis of the original number. Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei and other provinces, because they developed more new cooperatives in the first half of the year, have adopted the policy of "consolidating on one hand and developing on the other" in the second half of the year. All provinces are now training cadres. Zhejiang, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Xikang, Heilongjiang and other provinces have trained more than 40,000 cadres. Shanxi Province is preparing to train the directors and accountants of the existing credit cooperatives once.

Last winter, the "Preferential Grain Sales Savings" held by the People's Bank of China played a significant role in helping farmers accumulate funds for spring plowing production. Therefore, this year, the People's Bank of China in various regions will continue to hold "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" during grain and cotton procurement. The interest rate of "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" has been specifically stipulated by the head office of the People's Bank of China and is more favorable than the interest rate of general savings, and the procedures for deposit and payment have been improved compared with last year. Party committees and government departments in various provinces have arranged this work together with grain and cotton procurement. The People's Bank of China branches in more than ten provinces including Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Zhejiang have formulated deposit plans and specific measures. Many People's Bank of China business offices in Gansu Province have carried out savings reservation work for farmers. The People's Bank of China in Jin County and other places in Liaoning Province has also trained cadres to carry out "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" work.

In addition, plans and methods for recovering agricultural loans that are due have also been prepared in most areas.

    人民银行积极准备开展秋后农村金融工作
    【新华社二十二日讯】为配合秋后粮棉收购和农业生产互助合作运动的发展，中国人民银行系统正在为开展秋后农村金融工作作准备。
    今年秋后，农村信用合作组织将有很大发展。近几月来，各大区和省的人民银行大都召开了信用合作专业会议，总结工作，并根据本地区情况制订了秋冬季发展方针和发展计划。华东区各省计划在年底前训练干部十万五千多人，发展信用合作社
  （部）二万二千七百多个到二万四千七百多个。陕西分行九月份提出年底前发展新社二千七百多个，东北区行在八月份提出今年在原有基础上再发展信用合作社一倍。湖南、湖北、河南、河北等省因上半年发展新社较多，下半年都采取“一面巩固、一面发展”的方针。现在各省正在训练干部。浙江、广西、云南、贵州、河南、山东、四川、西康、黑龙江等省已训练了干部四万多人。山西省准备把现有信用合作社的主任和会计普遍训练一次。
    去年冬季，人民银行举办的“优待售粮储蓄”对帮助农民聚积春耕生产资金起了很大的作用，因此，今年各地人民银行在粮棉收购中，将继续举办
  “粮棉优待储蓄”。“粮棉优待储蓄”的利息已由人民银行总行作了具体规定，比一般储蓄的利息优厚，收储和兑付手续也比去年作了不少改进。各省党委和政府部门已把这个工作和粮食、棉花收购等工作一道作了布置。人民银行湖北、江西、河南、陕西、山东、浙江等十多省的分行已经订出收储计划和具体办法。甘肃省许多人民银行的营业所向农民进行了储蓄预约工作。辽宁省金县等地人民银行还训练了开展“粮棉优待储蓄”工作的干部。
    此外，收回到期农业贷款的计划和办法，各地也大都作了准备。
