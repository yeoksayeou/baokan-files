Leaders of various people's organizations have issued statements in support of the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué.

The responsible person of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stated: The governments of China and the Soviet Union solemnly announced that the two countries are in complete agreement on all aspects of the ever-developing comprehensive cooperation between the two countries and on various issues of the international situation. China and the Soviet Union have once again expressed their determination to resolutely safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. This is the happiness of the people in the Far East and the world. The peace fortress formed by 800 million people cannot be breached. Our great ally has once again expressed its unparalleled and profound friendship towards our country. With the generous and thoughtful assistance of our great ally, our country's socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. However, we must not be the slightest bit boastful or arrogant. With the progress of national construction, the responsibility of the Chinese working class is becoming increasingly important. The Chinese working class must better learn the patriotism and internationalism of the Soviet working class, better learn from the Soviet experience in socialist industrialization, and better learn from the Soviet Union's advanced technology and methods of managing enterprises. Trade union workers must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, learn from the experience of Soviet trade unions, master their own business, conscientiously organize labor competitions, conscientiously help workers raise their awareness, improve their culture and technology, and earnestly care for the lives of workers, thereby cultivating more cadres for the country and truly giving play to the role of trade unions as communist schools. The Chinese working class must take practical actions to support the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué and must respond to the deep affection of our great ally with labor achievements.

The responsible person of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation stated: The Sino-Soviet talks communiqué fully reflects the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union; it clearly marks the further development and consolidation of the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union; and it powerfully demonstrates the will and great strength of the two countries to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. The comprehensive, enormous, selfless assistance and unparalleled profound friendship of the Soviet government and people to our country constantly inspire Chinese women's belief and enthusiasm in building the motherland and defending world peace. Chinese women will always take the glorious Soviet women as their role models, and are determined to advance along the path taken by the great Soviet people, together with the people of the whole country, to build a prosperous, happy, and strong socialist motherland, to continuously improve the material and cultural life of our people, to create a better future for our children, and to continue to struggle for the defense of peace in the Far East and the world.

The responsible person of the All-China Youth Federation stated: The Soviet government and people provided comprehensive and selfless assistance to our country during the difficult period of restoring the national economy. This meeting has decided to grant loans to our country, expand the projects to help our country build new industrial enterprises, donate machines, and help establish large-scale grain farms. This once again embodies the comprehensive and selfless nature of the Soviet Union's assistance to our socialist construction; it once again embodies the unparalleled and profound friendship of the Soviet government and people to our government and people. We know that through these assistances, our country's socialist construction will be greatly promoted. The Chinese people and youth deeply know that the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is the greatest interest of the Chinese people. The Chinese youth are determined to, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, heighten vigilance, strictly guard against the imperialists' conspiracy to provoke the solidarity between China and the Soviet Union, and in their own positions, strive to learn the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in socialist construction, and build our motherland into a great socialist republic to thank the Soviet Union's assistance and consolidate the eternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

The responsible person of the All-China Students' Federation stated: Chinese students, with unparalleled excitement and joy, warmly welcome the joint declarations and joint communiqué of the Sino-Soviet talks. The close cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union is the greatest interest of the Chinese people and the greatest happiness of the Chinese students. The joint declarations and joint communiqué of the Sino-Soviet talks will encourage Chinese students to study even harder from the Soviet Union, master cultural and scientific knowledge, establish the idea of serving the people, exercise, and cultivate themselves into builders and defenders of the comprehensively developed socialist motherland. Chinese students are determined to, together with the people of the whole country, struggle for the consolidation and development of the great Sino-Soviet friendship and for the defense of peace in the Far East and the world.

Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, stated: The result of the Sino-Soviet talks marks the further consolidation and development of the unbreakable fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The friendly relations between China and the Soviet are based on the principles that are equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The brilliant achievements in various constructions over the past five years since the founding of our country cannot be separated from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The Chinese people are very grateful to the Soviet people for this brotherly and selfless help. This meeting also signed an agreement on the Soviet government providing a long-term loan of 520 million rubles to our government, and an agreement on the Soviet government helping our government to build 15 new industrial enterprises and expand the scope of supply for the 141 enterprises originally stipulated in the agreement. In this way, it will further promote the development of our country's socialist industrialization, and our socialist construction will obtain more material assistance. This precious friendship will be forever remembered in the hearts of the Chinese people.

The responsible person of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies stated: The completely selfless assistance given to us by the great Soviet government and people is what our national scientific workers are most moved by. In recent years, whether in factories, farms, schools, hospitals, scientific research, and enterprise institutions, we have continuously learned from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology and used the latest and most advanced equipment. In particular, under the meticulous guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, many large projects and enterprises have been built, and our scientific technology and production level have been improved. This has rapidly begun to change the backward face of production technology in old China. Our national scientific workers must cherish the Soviet Union's assistance to our science and technology, respond to Chairman Mao's call, and be honest and diligent; and set off a high tide of conscientiously studying the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must cherish all Soviet scientific and technological materials, conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, criticize all erroneous ideas that do not actively learn from the Soviet Union and do not use our brains, do not combine with China's reality, and simply rely on Soviet experts. We must give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of national scientific workers, and make a hundred times effort to build our country into a socialist country with a high degree of culture.

Liang Xi, Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, stated: We wholeheartedly support the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué! The cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity. This meeting shows that the economic and cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has been further developed. The Chinese people, who are engaged in socialist construction, express unlimited gratitude for the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union! The signing of an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is a great encouragement to Chinese scientific workers. Chinese scientific workers will, with the cooperation and help of the Soviet scientific and technological circles, strive to learn and disseminate the advanced science of the Soviet Union, improve the scientific and technological level of our working people, and build our country into a great socialist country with an industrialized and highly modern cultural level.

    中华全国民主妇女联合会负责人发表谈话说：中苏会谈公报充分地反映了中苏两国人民的共同愿望和根本利益；鲜明地标志着中苏两国牢不可破的友谊进一步的发展和巩固；有力地表现了两国为维护远东和世界和平的意志和伟大的力量。苏联政府和人民对我国的全面的、巨大的、无私的援助和无比深厚的友谊，时刻鼓舞着中国妇女建设祖国和保卫世界和平的信念和热情。中国妇女永远以光荣的苏联妇女作为自己学习的榜样，决心和全国人民一道，遵循着伟大的苏联人民所走过的道路前进，为建设繁荣、幸福、富强的社会主义的祖国，为不断增进我国人民的物质和文化生活，为替孩子们创造更美好的前途，为保卫远东和世界和平而继续奋斗。
    中华全国民主青年联合会负责人发表谈话说：苏联政府和人民曾经在我国恢复国民经济的艰难时期给予我国全面无私的援助。这次会谈又决定给我国贷款、扩大帮助我国新建工业企业的项目，赠送机器和帮助建立大型谷物农场等。这又一次体现了苏联对我国社会主义建设的援助是全面的、无私的；又一次体现了苏联政府和人民对我国政府和人民无比深厚的友谊。我们知道，通过这些援助，将大大推进我国的社会主义建设。中国人民和青年深深地知道，中苏两国的友好合作是中国人民的最大利益。中国青年决心和全国人民一起，在毛泽东主席领导下，提高警惕，严防帝国主义挑拨中苏团结的阴谋活动，在自己的岗位上，努力学习苏联的社会主义建设的先进经验，把我们祖国建成一个伟大的社会主义共和国，来感谢苏联的帮助，巩固中苏两国人民永恒友谊。

    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会负责人发表谈话说：伟大苏联政府和人民所给予我们的完全无私的帮助是我们全国科学工作者最感动的。几年来无论在工厂、农场、学校、医院和科学研究及企业机关中，我们都不断地学习了苏联的先进科学技术，使用了最新式的最先进的装备。特别是在苏联专家无微不至的指导和帮助之下，建设起了很多的巨大的工程和企业，提高了我们的科学技术和生产水平。这样就迅速地开始改变了旧中国生产技术落后的面貌。我们全国科学工作者一定要珍重苏联对我国的科学技术的帮助，响应毛主席的号召，老老实实，勤勤恳恳；掀起一个认真学习苏联先进科学技术的高潮。我们要珍爱一切苏联的科学技术资料，认真贯彻苏联专家的建议，批判一切不积极学习苏联和不开动脑筋、不结合中国实际、单纯地依赖苏联专家的错误思想。我们要发挥全国科学工作者的积极性和创造性，以百倍的努力把我国建设成为一个有高度文化的社会主义国家。
