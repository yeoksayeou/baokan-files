Under the superior socialist system, Soviet agricultural science is progressing day by day. Currently, in the Soviet Union, new and brilliant achievements have been made in the research on plant soil nutrition (i.e., root nutrition) and fertilization. This is the biological viewpoint of plant soil nutrition advocated by Academician Lysenko, President of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the Soviet Union, and the fertilization theory based on this viewpoint to create favorable conditions for the life activities of beneficial soil microorganisms. This fertilization theory is based on the advanced Michurin agricultural biology and Williams soil science of the Soviet Union, and is summarized from rich practical experience. This biological viewpoint of fertilization theory is essentially different from the previous purely chemical viewpoint of fertilization theory.

Academician Lysenko, according to the biological viewpoint of plant soil nutrition, created a scientific mixed fertilization method, that is, the mixed fertilization method of organic fertilizer (humus, decomposed manure, peat watered with manure juice, etc.), lime fertilizer (limestone powder and other lime fertilizers), and phosphate fertilizer (superphosphate, apatite powder, etc.). This fertilization method can fully exert the effectiveness of fertilizer and achieve the purpose of economical use of fertilizer.

This mixed fertilization method is to mix one and a half to three tons of organic fertilizer, three to five quintals of lime fertilizer (based on limestone), and two to three quintals of phosphate fertilizer (two to three quintals of superphosphate or three to four quintals of apatite powder, preferably half a quintal to one quintal of superphosphate plus two to three quintals of apatite powder) per hectare within one week before crop sowing (preferably one or two days), and then apply it into the soil according to the seed sowing depth. The preparation method of mixed fertilizer is to first mix the decomposed organic fertilizer and phosphate fertilizer evenly with a shovel, then add the pulverized lime and mix it carefully, and then apply it without composting. The prepared mixed fertilizer can be evenly spread on the ground, loosened with a disc harrow and covered with soil. It can also be applied in strips in the sowing ditch or in holes in the sowing hole. Vegetable crops (cucumber, tomato, etc.) are applied to the sowing hole or transplanting hole, and each hole needs at least 200 to 300 cubic centimeters of this mixed fertilizer. Fruit trees can be applied during soil loosening in spring, and each citrus tree and fruit tree needs 5 to 10 kilograms of mixed fertilizer. It is best to dig three to five small holes of 20 cm depth under each tree and apply it centrally, or dig a circular ditch under the crown and spread the fertilizer evenly in the ditch.

As for the application method in paddy fields, there is still a lack of practical experience. Theoretically speaking, when rice seedlings are transplanted, the mixed fertilizer can be applied to the field surface, or the mixed fertilizer can be mixed with water to form a paste, dipped in the roots of the seedlings, and then transplanted.

Academician Lysenko pointed out that in non-black soil areas (most of the soils are strongly acidic and lack organic matter and nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients), the use of this mixed fertilization method can obtain a grain yield equivalent to applying 30 to 40 tons of manure per hectare. For example, on fallow land (acidic podzolic soil) preparing to sow winter wheat or winter rye, 30 to 40 tons of manure used to be applied. Now it has been confirmed that if two to three tons of organic fertilizer, plus three to five quintals of lime and two to three quintals of apatite powder mixed fertilizer per hectare are applied into the soil according to the seed sowing depth within one week before sowing, the winter wheat yield obtained by this fertilization is the same as the yield obtained by applying 30 to 40 tons of manure. That is to say, using this mixed fertilization method can expand the fertilization area of the same amount of organic fertilizer to ten times the original. According to the results of large-scale production experiments on tens of thousands of hectares of land in the Soviet Union in recent years, this mixed fertilization method has proven to be effective not only on podzolic soil, but also on chernozem, degraded chernozem, or leached saline-alkali chernozem. At the same time, this mixed fertilization method is not only very effective in increasing the yield of winter cereal crops, but also has the same effect on intercropping crops, industrial raw material crops, horticultural crops (vegetables and fruit trees), etc. Therefore, today, when fertilizer is generally insufficient in our country, actively experimenting with and adopting this mixed fertilization method is of great significance.

Why is the effectiveness of this mixed fertilization method so great?

Regarding this issue, we must first talk about the relationship between soil microorganisms and plant nutrition. We know that the soil contains a large number of various microorganisms that are invisible to the naked eye. One cubic centimeter (equivalent to 3.2 cent) of fertile soil often contains millions to hundreds of billions of microorganisms. These microorganisms have a great effect on plant soil nutrition. It must be understood that the plant soil nutrition process is the same as the animal nutrition process. It is a biological process. In the animal nutrition process, the function of the digestive system of the animal organism is to transform food that is originally unsuitable for direct absorption by the organs and tissues of the animal organism into substances that can be absorbed and utilized after digestion. There are similar situations in plant soil nutrition, and the soil microorganisms perform a similar function to the digestive system of animal organisms. The soil may usually store a large number of plant nutrients, but these substances are in a compound state that is difficult to be absorbed, and plants cannot directly use them. However, when appropriate conditions are available, as a result of the life activities of the soil microbial community, these substances are transformed by microorganisms into nutrients suitable for plant absorption. For example, iron bacteria can separate iron from minerals and accumulate it in the soil; silicate bacteria can decompose potassium from aluminum silicates and accumulate it in the soil; microorganisms that decompose complex polysaccharides (cellulose) and microorganisms that decompose complex organic nitrogen compounds can decompose animal and plant organic remains (plant green groups, straw stalks, animal bones, etc.) in the soil into inorganic substances for plant utilization. In the process of transforming nutrients in the soil that plants cannot use, soil microorganisms simultaneously carry out another process, which is to use inorganic compounds in the soil, or use nitrogen and carbon dioxide in the air to synthesize new organic compounds as a source of plant nutrition. For example, nitrogen-fixing bacteria can fix free nitrogen in the air and accumulate it in the soil. In this way, as a result of microbial activity, the soil has nitrogen and ash elements (phosphorus, potassium, iron, etc.) that can be absorbed and utilized by plants, which creates material conditions for soil fertility and plant nutrition. Therefore, the plant soil nutrition process is carried out with the help of the life activities of beneficial soil microorganisms that are adapted to it.

Each plant has a soil microbial community living in the range distributed by its roots that is adapted to it. The life of each plant and the life of soil microorganisms suitable for this plant are interconnected. When the life activities of beneficial soil microbial communities are better and more vigorous, more nutrients that plants can absorb are formed in the soil, and plants can grow and develop better, thereby increasing the yield of crops. At the same time, the better the plant grows, the more secretions from the plant roots, and these secretions can promote the good development of microorganisms that are beneficial to this plant. This is the mutual connection between plants and the soil microorganisms that suit them. Conversely, when the life activities of beneficial soil microorganisms are not vigorous, there will be fewer nutrients that plants can absorb in the soil, plant nutrition will be affected, thereby inhibiting plant growth and development, and of course it is impossible to obtain high yields. It can be seen that soil microorganisms are very important to plant soil nutrition, and their effect on improving soil fertility and increasing crop yields is huge. Therefore, to improve soil fertility and increase crop yields, we must first create living conditions that are conducive to the activities of beneficial soil microorganisms to promote their vigorous life activities.

Creating favorable conditions for the normal life activities of soil microbial communities can ensure the improvement of soil fertility. The soil often lacks a small portion of substances necessary for the normal life of beneficial soil microorganisms, which affects the normal life activities of soil microorganisms, resulting in low soil fertility, lack of nutrients for crops, and low yields. As long as some necessary substances (fertilizers) are applied to the soil to make up for the conditions lacking in the normal life activities of beneficial soil microbial communities, the soil will become fertile and can significantly increase crop yields. As a result of the life activities of beneficial soil microbial groups, the plant nutrients in the soil are enriched, so that although the amount of mixed fertilizer applied is relatively small, crops can also obtain high yields. This is the reason why the mixed fertilization effect is good.

Why must mixed fertilizer be applied within one week before sowing, according to the seed sowing depth?

The microorganisms living in the soil around the roots (rhizosphere) and on the root surface are particularly dense. The number of microorganisms in the same soil without living plant roots outside the rhizosphere is tens to hundreds of times more. For example, in podzolic soil in Moscow, Soviet Union, the number of microorganisms in one cubic centimeter of soil in the wheat rhizosphere is 1.75 billion, while the number of microorganisms in one cubic centimeter of soil outside the rhizosphere is only 2.5 million; the number of microorganisms in one cubic centimeter of soil in the clover rhizosphere is 2.5 billion, while the number of microorganisms in one cubic centimeter of soil outside the rhizosphere is only 1.2 million. Many kinds of soil microorganisms show strong life activities in the rhizosphere, while outside the rhizosphere, these kinds of microorganisms do not exist, or their life activities are severely inhibited. These facts show that some organic substances (sugar and organic acids) secreted by plant roots are favorable conditions for microbial reproduction. Many products of microbial life activities living in the rhizosphere are essential substances for plant root nutrition, and are also nutrients needed by some microorganisms outside the rhizosphere. The life activities of these microorganisms living outside the rhizosphere can transform substances in the soil that plants cannot absorb into substances that can be absorbed. Therefore, it is particularly important to promote the vigorous development of the life activities of beneficial soil microorganisms in the plant rhizosphere. Since plant root nutrition is carried out with the help of adapted and beneficial soil microorganisms, it is necessary to ensure that these microorganisms have normal conditions for life activities. Therefore, sufficient nutrients should and must be given to the beneficial soil microorganisms near or on the roots of plants, especially to the beneficial soil microorganisms in the range of plant young roots. As Academician Lysenko pointed out: "The products of the life activities of these microorganisms living in the range of young roots are necessary for normal plant nutrition. The mixed fertilizer of organic matter, mineral phosphorus, and lime that we recommend is the necessary nutrient for microorganisms living in the range of young roots of crops." Therefore, mixed fertilizer must not be applied too early before sowing, but should be applied within one week before sowing (preferably one or two days); and the application should not be too deep, but should be applied according to the seed sowing depth. The purpose of this application is to: just when the seeds of crops germinate and the young roots begin to grow, supply the beneficial soil microorganisms in the range of crop young roots with the necessary nutrients neither early nor late, nor too deep nor too shallow, so that they can get good living conditions, promote their life activities, so that crops can obtain sufficient nutrition and increase crop yields.

The correctness and scientific nature of the biological viewpoint of plant soil nutrition advocated by Academician Lysenko, and the fertilization theory based on this viewpoint to create favorable conditions for the life activities of beneficial soil microorganisms, has been completely proven by extensive production practice in the Soviet Union. The creation of this major scientific theory not only clarified in theory that the real process of plant soil nutrition is a biological process, not a simple chemical process; but also opened up infinitely broad prospects in agricultural practice for improving soil fertility, improving plant nutrition conditions, and increasing crop yields.

This scientific fertilization theory and method has extremely important practical significance for improving agricultural production in our country. At present, our country lacks organic fertilizer and insufficient fertilization of farmland, which affects agricultural production. Learning to use this advanced fertilization method can greatly improve this situation, rapidly expand the fertilization area, create favorable conditions for the massive increase in production of various crops, and enhance the support of agriculture for the country's socialist industrialization. Therefore, agricultural science research institutes, agricultural experiment stations, state-owned farms, and agricultural workers in various places must actively and conscientiously learn this scientific fertilization theory and technology, correctly grasp the principles and essence of this theory, combine the conditions of different soils and crops in various places, conduct experimental research, create and accumulate practical experience in specific applications in various places, and find out fertilization measures that suit the specific conditions of the local area, to prepare for future promotion work.

    有机质肥料、石灰物质和磷肥的混合施肥法
    邓锡鎏
    在优越的社会主义制度下，苏联的农业科学正日益进步。目前在苏联，关于植物土壤营养（即根部营养）问题和施肥问题的研究，又取得了新的辉煌的成就。这便是苏联全苏列宁农业科学院院长李森科院士所提倡的植物土壤营养的生物学观点，以及依据这种观点而创立的为有益的土壤微生物的生命活动创造有利条件的施肥理论。这种施肥理论，是根据苏联先进的米丘林农业生物学说和威廉斯土壤学说，从丰富的实践经验中总结出来的。这种生物学观点的施肥理论同过去的单纯化学观点的施肥理论，有着本质上的不同。
    李森科院士根据植物土壤营养的生物学观点所创立的施肥理论，提出了一种科学的混合施肥方法，即有机质肥料（腐植质、腐熟的厩肥、浇有粪汁的泥炭等）、石灰质肥料（石灰石粉和其他石灰肥料）和磷素肥料（过磷酸钙、磷灰石粉等）的混合施肥方法。这种施肥方法能够充分发挥肥料效用，达到经济利用肥料的目的。
    这种混合施肥方法，是在作物播种前一星期内
  （最好是一、两天内），每公顷以一吨半到三吨有机质肥料，三公担到五公担石灰质肥料（以石灰石为标准）和二公担到三公担磷素肥料（可用二公担到三公担过磷酸钙或三公担到四公担磷灰石粉，最好是用半公担到一公担过磷酸钙加上二公担到三公担磷灰石粉），把三者混合以后，按照种子播种深度施入土中。混合肥料的调制方法是，先将腐熟的有机质肥料和磷素肥料用锹翻拌均匀，然后加入粉碎的石灰，同样仔细地混拌均匀后，即可施用，不须经过堆沤。调制好的混合肥料，可以均匀撒布在地里，用圆盘耙耙耕松土加以覆盖。也可以条施于播种沟内，或穴施于播种穴中。蔬菜作物（黄瓜、蕃茄等）施用于播种穴或定植穴中，每一穴至少需施用这种混合肥料二百到三百公分。果树则可在春季进行松土时施用，每一棵柑桔树和果树需施用五到十公斤的混合肥料，最好在每棵树下挖三到五个二十公分深度的小穴集中施用，或在树冠范围下挖圆沟，把肥料平均施布在沟内。
      至于水稻田的施用方法，目前还缺乏实际经验。理论上来说，可以在水稻秧苗移植时，把混合肥料施于田面，或者把混合肥料加上水调制成糊状，把它蘸在秧苗根部，然后插植。
      李森科院士指出：在非黑土地带（大部分的土壤酸性强，土壤中缺少有机质和氮、磷养分），采用这种混合施肥方法，谷物产量可以获得相当于每公顷施用三十吨到四十吨厩肥的收获量。例如，在准备播种冬小麦或冬黑麦的休闲地上（酸性灰化土），过去要施用三十吨到四十吨厩肥。现在证实如果在播种前一星期内，每公顷用二吨到三吨有机质肥料，加上三公担到五公担石灰和二公担到三公担磷灰石粉的混合肥料，按照种子播种深度施入土中，这样施肥所收获的冬小麦产量，和施用三十吨到四十吨厩肥所获得的产量是一样的。这就是说，采用这种混合施肥方法，可以把同样一份有机质肥料的施肥面积扩大到原来的十倍。这种混合施肥方法，根据苏联近几年来在几万公顷土地上大规模生产试验的结果证明，不但应用在灰化土上，而且应用在黑钙土、退化黑钙土或脱硷黑硷土上，它的效果也都不错。同时，这种混合施肥方法，不仅对提高冬季禾谷类作物的产量有很好的效果，就是对中耕作物，工业原料作物，园艺作物（蔬菜和果树）等也都有同样的效果。因此，今天在我国肥料普遍不足的情况下，积极试验和采用这种混合施肥方法，就有十分重要的意义。
    这种混合施肥方法的效用为什么这样大？
    关于这个问题，首先要谈一谈土壤微生物和植物营养的关系。我们知道，土壤中含有极大数量的肉眼看不见的各种微生物，一公分（合三点二市分）重量的肥沃土壤中，往往含有几百万到几十万万个微生物。这些微生物对于植物土壤营养有很大的作用。必须了解，植物的土壤营养过程和动物的营养过程是一样的，它是一种生物学过程。在动物营养过程中，动物有机体消化系统的功能，在于把原来不适于动物有机体器官和组织直接吸收状态的食物，经过消化作用后，转化成为能被吸收利用状态的物质。在植物土壤营养中也有类似的情况存在，而执行着和动物有机体消化系统的机能相似作用的，就是土壤微生物。土壤中通常可能储藏着大量的植物营养物质，但是这些物质是处于难被吸收的化合物状态下，植物不能直接利用它们。然而，在具备适当条件时，通过土壤微生物群生命活动的结果，这些物质就被微生物转化成适于植物吸收状态的养料。例如，铁细菌可把矿物中的铁分离出来并积累在土壤中；矽酸盐细菌能把铝矽酸盐中的钾分解出来并积累在土壤中；分解复杂多醣类（纤维素）的微生物群和分解复杂有机氮化合物的微生物群能够把土壤中动植物有机遗体（植物绿色群体，藁杆，动物骨骼等）分解成为无机物质，供给植物的利用。在改造土壤里植物不能利用的营养物质的过程中，土壤微生物同时进行着另外一种过程，这就是利用土壤里的无机化合物，或者利用空气中的氮素和二氧化碳进行合成新的有机化合物，作为植物营养的来源。例如，固氮细菌可以把空气中的游离氮素固定起来并积累在土壤中。这样，由于微生物活动的结果，土壤中就具有可供植物吸收利用的氮素和灰分原素（磷、钾、铁等），就为土壤肥力和植物营养创造了物质条件。所以，植物土壤营养过程是借助于和它相适应的有益的土壤微生物底生命活动来进行的。
    每一种植物在它的根部所分布的范围内，都有和它相适应的土壤微生物群生活着。每一种植物的生活和适合于这种植物的土壤微生物的生活是相互联系着的。当有益的土壤微生物群的生命活动越良好，越旺盛，土壤中植物所能吸收的养料就形成得越多，植物也就能够生长和发育得越良好，从而提高农作物的产量。同时，植物生长得越良好，植物根部的分泌物就愈多，这些分泌物能促进有益于这种植物的微生物底发育良好。这就是植物和适合它的土壤微生物的相互联系。相反地，当有益的土壤微生物底生命活动不旺盛，土壤中植物所能吸收的养料就会少些，植物的营养就受影响，从而抑制了植物的生长和发育，这样当然不可能获得丰产。由此可见，土壤微生物对于植物土壤营养的关系是非常重要的，它对提高土壤肥力，增加农作物产量的作用是巨大的。所以，要提高土壤肥力，增加农作物产量，首先必须创造有利于有益的土壤微生物活动的生活条件，以促进它们旺盛的生命活动。
    为土壤微生物群正常的生命活动创造有利的条件，就能够保证土壤肥力的提高。土壤里往往由于缺少对有益的土壤微生物正常生活所必需的一小部分物质，影响了土壤微生物正常的生命活动，以致土壤肥力低，农作物缺乏养料，产量少。只要在土壤中施用一些必需的物质（肥料），补足有益的土壤微生物群正常生命活动所缺少的条件，土壤就会变得肥沃，并能显著地提高农作物的产量。由于有益的土壤微生物集团生命活动的结果，使土壤中的植物营养物质丰富起来，这样，混合肥料的施用量虽然相当少，农作物也能获得高额的产量，混合施肥效用良好的道理就在这里。
    为什么混合肥料必须在播种前一星期内，按照种子播种深度来施用？
    在植物根系周围（根圈）和根表面的土壤中，栖居的微生物特别稠密，它比根圈外边没有植物活根的同样土壤中，微生物的数量要多几十到几百倍。例如在苏联莫斯科的灰化土中，小麦根圈内一公分重量的土壤中，微生物的数目为十七亿五千万，而根圈外一公分重量的土壤中，微生物的数目仅为二百五十万；三叶草根圈内一公分重量的土壤中，微生物的数目为二十五亿，而根圈外一公分重量的土壤中，微生物的数目只有一百二十万。许多种土壤微生物在根圈内现出强烈的生命活动，而在根圈外，没有这些种微生物的存在，或者它们的生命活动受到严重的抑制。这些事实说明了植物根部所分泌出来的
  一些有机物质（糖和有机酸）是微生物繁殖的有利条件。而生活在根圈中的微生物生命活动的许多产物，是植物根部营养的必需物质，并且也是根圈外边某些微生物所需的养料。而这些生活在根圈外的微生物底生命活动，能够把土壤中植物不能吸收的物质转化成可吸收状态的物质。因此，促使植物根圈范围中有益的土壤微生物生命活动的旺盛发展，就显得特别重要。由于植物根部的营养既然是借助于相适应的、有益的土壤微生物的活动，这就必须保证这些微生物的生命活动具有正常的条件。所以，对于植物根部附近或根上的有益的土壤微生物，特别是对于植物幼根范围内有益的土壤微生物，应当而且必须给予充足的养料。正如李森科院士所指出：“这些生活在幼根范围的微生物生命活动的产物，是植物正常营养所必需的。我们推荐的有机质、矿物质磷和石灰的混合肥料，是在农作物幼根范围内生活的微生物必需的养分。”因此，混合肥料必定不要在播种前过早地施用，而应在播种前一星期内（最好是一、两天内）施用；并且施用不要过深，而应按照种子播种的深度来施用。这样施用的目的就在于：正当农作物的种子发芽幼根开始生长的时候，既不早不晚，也不深不浅地供给作物幼根范围内有益的土壤微生物以必需的养料，使它们得到良好的生活条件，促进它们的生命活动，从而就可以使得农作物能够获得充分的营养，提高农作物的收获量。
    李森科院士所提倡的植物土壤营养的生物学观点，以及依据这种观点而创立的为有益的土壤微生物的生命活动创造有利条件的施肥理论，其正确性和科学性在苏联已完全为广泛的生产实践所证明。这一重大的科学理论的创立，不但在学术上，明确了植物土壤营养的真实过程，是一种生物学过程，不是单纯的化学过程；而且在农业实践上，对于提高土壤肥力，改善植物营养条件，以增加农作物产量的问题，开辟了无限广阔的前途。
    这种科学的施肥理论和方法，对于提高我国农业生产有着极重大的现实意义。目前，我国有机质肥料缺乏，农田施肥不足，影响农业增产，学习运用这一先进的施肥方法，将可以大大地改善这种情况，迅速地扩大施肥面积，为各种农作物的大量增产创造有利条件，增强农业对国家社会主义工业化的支援力量。所以，各地农业科学研究所、农事试验场和国营农场，以及农业工作者，必须积极地并且认真地学习这种科学的施肥理论和技术，正确地掌握这一理论的原理和实质，结合各地不同的土壤作物等条件，进行试验研究，创造并积累各地具体应用上的实际经验，找出切合当地具体情况的施肥措施，为今后推广工作做好准备。
