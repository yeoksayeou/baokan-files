Xinhua News Agency, New York, 17th Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee continued its discussion on disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction from the 13th to the 15th.

The Canadian representative, Martin, stated that the possibility of reaching an agreement on disarmament is much greater now than before, given the current circumstances. He expressed disagreement with a portion of the Soviet proposal regarding the supervisory committee. He also stated his agreement with the Soviet representative Vyshinsky's point that there are no insurmountable differences preventing an agreement on the issues under discussion. Martin advocated that the Disarmament Commission should convene its sub-committee to continue efforts to coordinate the proposals made by the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries after the Political Committee has conducted a broad and unrestricted discussion on the issue. Martin put forward a proposal stipulating the holding of the aforementioned sub-committee.

The Belgian representative pointed out in his speech that indications of convergence in various attitudes have emerged on certain issues of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. He gave a favorable evaluation of the Soviet proposals. At the same time, he pointed out that serious differences still exist in many respects, especially on the scope of disarmament, as well as the functions and powers of the supervisory body. He then said that, given the good conditions that have emerged, it is timely to continue discussing this issue in the Disarmament Commission.

The Yugoslav representative pointed out that the Soviet proposals make it possible to resolve the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. He said that in order to ensure the resolution of the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons, and the smooth implementation of international agreements, the spirit of mutual cooperation and trust between the two sides must be restored. He emphasized that every achievement in disarmament will directly improve international relations.

The British representative, Lloyd, delivered a lengthy speech, stating the Western countries' attitude towards the nature, functions, and powers of the supervisory body, while attempting to create the impression that the Soviet proposal was by no means based on the proposals of the United Kingdom and France. The French representative, Moch, expressed complete agreement with the British representative's opinion.

The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, in his speech, once again explained the Soviet government's attitude as expressed in the Soviet proposal, and said that a principled agreement should be reached on the issues currently under discussion, before seriously considering the details and methods of implementing this agreement. He pointed out that the British representative's argument that the Soviet proposal was not based on the proposals of the United Kingdom and France was completely unreasonable. He convincingly demonstrated that the main provisions of the Soviet proposal and the proposals of the United Kingdom and France either correspond to each other or are very close to each other. The differences between the Soviet proposal and the proposals of the United Kingdom and France lie in the views and solutions to certain fundamental issues of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

    联大政委会继续讨论裁减军备问题
    维辛斯基主张就裁军问题先达成原则协议
     【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十三日至十五日继续讨论裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题。
    加拿大代表马丁发言说，在目前的情况下，在裁军问题上达成协议的可能性比以前大得多了。他表示不同意苏联提案中关于监督委员会的一部分。他又说，他同意苏联代表维辛斯基的这个观点：没有什么不可消除的分歧，阻碍着就讨论中的问题达成协议。马丁主张在政治委员会对这个问题进行广泛的、不受限制的讨论之后，裁减军备委员会才应召集它的小组委员会继续努力把苏联、法国、英国、美国和其他国家提出的建议协调起来。马丁提出了一个提案，规定举行上述小组委员会。
    比利时代表在发言中指出，在裁减军备和禁止原子武器的某些问题上，已出现了各种态度趋于接近的迹象。他对苏联的建议给予了好评。他同时指出，在许多方面还存在着严重的分歧，尤其是在裁减军备的范围问题上，以及监督机构的职能和权限问题上。他接着说，在已出现的良好条件下，在裁减军备委员会中继续讨论这一问题是适合时宜的。
    南斯拉夫代表指出，苏联的建议使裁减军备和禁止使用核子武器的问题有可能获得解决。他说，为了保证裁减军备和禁止使用核子武器问题的解决，以及顺利地实现国际协定，必须恢复双方相互合作与信任的精神。他着重指出，裁减军备的每一成就都会直接改善国际关系。
    英国代表劳埃德发表了一篇冗长的演说，表明西方国家对监督机构的性质、职能和权力的态度，同时他力图造成一种印象，仿佛苏联建议决不是以英、法两国的建议为基础的。法国代表莫克表示完全同意英国代表的意见。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言再一次解释了苏联提案中表明的苏联政府的态度，他并说，目前应该就正在讨论中的问题达成原则上的协议，然后再认真地考虑履行这个协议的细节和方法。他指出，英国代表所谓苏联建议不是以英、法两国建议为基础的论点是完全不合理的。他令人信服地说明，苏联建议和英、法两国建议的主要规定不是彼此符合，就是彼此很接近的。苏联建议和英、法两国建议之间的分歧是在对裁减军备和禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的某些基本问题的看法和解决办法上。
