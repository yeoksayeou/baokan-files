    China Medical Association Headquarters Issues Instructions on Strengthening Traditional Chinese Medicine Work
    The China Medical Association Headquarters issued instructions to all branches emphasizing the need to strengthen Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) work, calling for strengthening the unity between TCM and Western medicine, promoting academic exchange between TCM and Western medicine, and carrying forward the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine.
    The instructions pointed out: The China Medical Association Headquarters and its branches have not given enough importance to TCM work. Although since April 1953, the comprehensive topic academic seminars organized by the China Medical Association Headquarters have paid attention to inviting TCM practitioners to participate and have invited TCM practitioners to give special reports, such as "TCM's Understanding and Treatment of Hypertension," "Records and Contributions of Diabetes in Chinese History," "TCM's Understanding and Treatment of Diabetes," and "China's History of Tuberculosis," etc. After the establishment of the China Medical Association Headquarters' Committee for Academic Exchange between TCM and Western Medicine in November 1953, it successively held six large-scale seminars and two small-scale seminars to study Chinese medicines such as rhubarb, coptis, and pinellia. At the same time, it also held reports such as "The History of the Development of Chinese Medicine." Publications such as the Chinese Medical Journal, edited and published by the Headquarters, also selected and published materials on TCM diagnosis and Chinese medicine research. Local branches in Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Beijing have also done some work. But generally speaking, the work done is very insufficient, mostly staying on the surface, and the effect is not great. At the same time, some branches still do not pay enough attention to this work, and this situation must be changed immediately.
    In order to strengthen the unity between TCM and Western medicine and the academic exchange between TCM and Western medicine, the instructions put forward the following specific measures:
    First, members should be educated to change and correct their wrong views on TCM and Chinese medicine ideologically, and correctly understand and value the medical heritage of the motherland. Secondly, institutions leading this work should be established or strengthened quickly to examine and summarize the previous work and enrich the content of this work. Third, strengthen the unity and academic exchange between TCM and Western medicine, such as organizing seminars on TCM and Chinese medicine issues, organizing TCM lectures, and inviting TCM practitioners to participate in academic reports of various disciplines. Fourth, mobilize members to study TCM, learn from experienced TCM practitioners, follow them in clinical outpatient services and treatment, select and read TCM books such as Materia Medica, Inner Canon, Treatise on Febrile Diseases, Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber, etc., and systematically study and research TCM and Chinese medicine academics.
    The instructions finally emphasized that TCM is an important part of the national heritage, and the treatment of diseases for the vast majority of the people in our country is in the hands of TCM practitioners. Therefore, strengthening the work on TCM is a major issue related to the health of the people of our country.

    中华医学会总会发出加强中医工作的指示
    中华医学会总会对各分会发出了必须加强中医工作的指示，号召加强中西医的团结和中西医的学术交流工作，发扬祖国医学遗产。
    指示指出：中华医学会总会和各分会对中医工作的重视是不够的。虽然从一九五三年四月起，中华医学会总会组织的综合选题学术座谈会，都注意邀请中医参加，并请中医做了专题报告：如“中医对高血压的认识和治疗”、“中国历代糖尿病的记载和贡献”、“中医对糖尿病的认识和治疗”、“我国结核病疾病史”等。一九五三年十一月中华医学会总会中西医学术交流委员会成立后，先后开过六次大型座谈会和两次小型座谈会，研究了大黄、黄连、半夏等国药。同时还举办了“中国医学发展史”等的报告会。总会编辑出版的中华医学杂志等刊物，也选登了中医诊断及中药研究方面的材料。各地分会中重庆、杭州、北京分会等也都作了一些工作。但总的来讲工作做得是很不够的，多是停留在表面上，起的效果也不大，同时还有一些分会对这项工作还很不重视，这种情况必须立即转变。
    为了加强中西医的团结和中西医的学术交流工作，指示提出了以下一些具体措施：
    首先应教育会员从思想上转变和纠正对中医中药的错误观点，正确认识和重视祖国的医学遗产。其次应迅速成立或加强领导这一工作的机构，检查总结前一段的工作，充实这一工作的内容。第三是加强中西医团结和学术交流工作，如组织中医中药问题的座谈会，组织中医讲座等，并邀请中医参加各科学术报告会。第四要发动会员学习中医，向有经验的中医学习，跟着作临床门诊和治疗，选读中医书籍如本草、内经、伤寒论、金匮要略等，有系统地学习研究中医中药学术等。
    指示最后着重指出，中医是祖国遗产中重要部分，我国绝大多数人民的疾病治疗是掌握在中医手里。因此，加强对中医的工作，是一个关系我国人民的健康的重大问题。
