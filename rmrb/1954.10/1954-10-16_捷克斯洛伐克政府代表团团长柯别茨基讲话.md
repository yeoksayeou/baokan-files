Dear Chinese friends, respected comrades:

    At this moment of parting, please allow me to express my warmest gratitude for the unforgettable and beautiful days that the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic experienced during the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    We will never forget the impression left on us by the National Day celebrations on October 1st. We saw how joyfully the Chinese people were celebrating their liberated new life, how much they loved their heroic Chinese Communist Party, and how much they revered their victorious leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. We saw the ardent and profound feelings of the Chinese people towards the Soviet Union, and their sincere friendship towards the various people's democratic countries.

    Our visits to several cities in China have made it possible for us to personally recognize how successfully the Chinese people are continuing their construction cause and how the great China is heading towards strength and prosperity.

    We sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on achieving the greatest achievements on the road to socialist society. We can only respond to the friendly care and hospitality we received during our stay in the People's Republic of China with this promise: we will more enthusiastically introduce the new China to the people, and we will work harder to consolidate the friendship between the Czech and Chinese people for the benefit of our two peoples.

    Long live the People's Republic of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China!
    
    Long live the Hero

    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团团长柯别茨基讲话亲爱的中国朋友们，尊敬的同志们：
    在这离别的时刻，请允许我对捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团在中华人民共和国庆祝五周年国庆时所经历到的、不能忘记的、美丽的日子表示最热烈的感谢。
    十月一日国庆典礼所留给我们的印象是我们永远也不会忘记的。我们看见了中国人民是在如何愉快地欢庆自己解放了的新生活，我们看见了中国人民是多么地爱戴自己英勇的中国共产党，是多么地敬爱自己的胜利的领袖毛泽东同志。我们看见了中国人民对苏联是怀着多么热烈和深厚的感情，对于各人民民主国家又是怀着如何诚挚的友谊。
    我们在中国几个城市的访问使我们有可能亲身认识到中国人民是在怎样成功地继续着自己的建设事业以及伟大的中国是在如何地走向强盛和繁荣。
    我们衷心地祝贺中国人民在向社会主义社会迈进的道路上取得最伟大的成就。对于我们在中华人民共和国逗留期间所受到的友谊的关怀和款待，我们只有用这样的诺言来回答：我们将更加热情地介绍人民的新中国，为了我们两国人民的利益我们将更加努力地巩固捷中两国的友谊。
    中华人民共和国和中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    英勇的中国共产党万岁！
    祝捷中友谊日益发展和巩固！
    我们共同的盟邦，伟大的苏联万岁！
    中国人民敬爱的领袖，中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志万岁！
