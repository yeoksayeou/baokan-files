    Former Government Administration Council's People's Supervision Committee
    Inspection Report on the Problem of Overstocked Steel Materials (More Than 4,000 Tons)
    On March 28th of this year, this newspaper published a letter from Qian Yige and Tian Chunlin of the Finance and Accounting Department of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building, exposing that the former Central Ministry of Heavy Industry had over 4,000 tons of steel materials overstocked for more than three years, stored outdoors, causing huge losses to the country.

    Regarding this incident, the former Government Administration Council's People's Supervision Committee, together with the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the State Bureau of Material Reserves, formed a team to conduct an inspection, analyzing the reasons for the overstocking of steel materials and the responsibilities of the relevant departments and personnel. At the same time, the Ministry of Heavy Industry also formed a disposal team with the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, the State Bureau of Material Allocation, the State Bureau of Material Reserves, and other units to test and dispose of this batch of steel materials. The following is a summary of the inspection report of the former Government Administration Council's People's Supervision Committee:

    In October 1950, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry received a batch of steel materials from the East China Warehouse Material Clearing and Transfer Branch. In addition to the part that was distributed successively, more than 4,000 tons were stored in Taiyuan and Yuci, Shanxi. This batch of steel materials was overstocked for a long time and poorly managed, causing great losses to the country.

    According to the results of the testing and preliminary analysis by the disposal team, most of these 4,500 tons of steel materials are of specifications commonly used in production, and if actively disposed of, they could be utilized as soon as possible. The reason for the long-term overstocking and corrosion is mainly that the relevant departments did not pay enough attention to state materials, and some even adopted an indifferent attitude, in addition to some objective difficulties.

    First of all, the former Ministry of Heavy Industry's Business Bureau did not actively handle and distribute this batch of steel materials, but repeatedly requested to return the goods; in addition, the specific handover was not carried out when the Ministry of Heavy Industry was divided in 1952, resulting in unclear responsibilities later. The Ministry of Heavy Industry had some blindness when claiming this batch of steel materials in Shanghai at the end of 1950. However, from the time of receipt to February 1952, the composition of the steel materials had not been tested, and the more than 2,000 tons of steel materials stored in Yuci had not been distributed, so it requested the former Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee to return the materials. In April of the same year, the Central Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of relevant units to discuss and decide: "The materials that have been taken away will not be returned. The Ministry of Heavy Industry should try its best to distribute and use them; the parts that are indeed not suitable for use shall be managed by the Ministry of Heavy Industry on its behalf. The Ministry of Heavy Industry shall immediately sort out and identify the undistributed materials, calculate the price according to the domestic transfer price, and pay separately according to the year of use." However, the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Business Bureau did not implement this resolution, but only estimated the price of the steel materials and handed it over to the Finance Department to handle the accounting procedures. In August, before the division of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, it again requested the Central Ministry of Finance to hand it over. At the end of August, when the Ministry of Heavy Industry was reorganized, it was not determined which ministry would be responsible for handling this batch of steel materials. Since then, this batch of steel materials has been in a state of no one being responsible for it.

    Secondly, the relevant departments did not earnestly implement the instructions of the higher authorities and various agreements, and shirked their responsibilities to each other. At the end of September 1952, the former Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee replied to the Ministry of Heavy Industry, disagreeing with the return of materials, and asked the Ministry of Heavy Industry to find ways to utilize them and investigate the responsibility for improper storage. This official document was pushed back and forth between the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Business Bureau and the Supply Bureau and Finance Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building; at that time, these units were still working in the same place, and they did not contact each other for consultation, so that there was still no result after more than half a month. Under the supervision of the General Administration of Materials Management, although relevant personnel had a joint meeting in October to study and propose that the Ministry of Heavy Industry be responsible for the testing and distribution of this batch of steel materials, the storage units be responsible for the storage, and the Finance Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building be responsible for the financial work. However, after the meeting, the relevant departments still shirked their responsibilities to each other, and no one was responsible for handling the steel materials.

    Finally, the management and maintenance of steel materials were neglected. The steel materials were transported to Shanxi at the beginning of 1951, but until the division of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in 1952, the Ministry of Heavy Industry did not give specific instructions on the storage problem. Later, although it was determined that the storage units were responsible for the storage and maintenance, the First Ministry of Machine Building and other units did not take specific measures or convey it to the storage units. The steel materials stored in the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory were piled up in the open air because the factory had no warehouse, and many fell into the soil. The workers and masses put forward their opinions many times, but the factory initially did not pay attention to it and only urged the higher authorities to transfer it away quickly; until August 1953, the factory proposed to build temporary sheds, but the State Bureau of Material Reserves disagreed with the construction of sheds (until February of this year was it approved). Therefore, the steel materials were generally rusty, and most of them had peeling and pitting. The steel materials stored in Yuci, except for more than 700 tons of large square steel, which were stacked in the open air in cement stacks layer by layer because the warehouse was crowded at that time, the rest were placed in the warehouse, and the loss was relatively small. According to the estimation of the disposal team, the loss caused by corrosion of the steel materials stored in the two places (including the corrosion during storage in East China) is worth more than 2.4 billion yuan at the transfer price.

    The above situation shows that in handling this batch of steel materials, the relevant units and personnel all showed varying degrees of irresponsibility for state property. Among the relevant units, the former Ministry of Heavy Industry's Business Bureau, the current Ministry of Heavy Industry's Sales Bureau, and the current Ministry of Heavy Industry's Business Bureau are more responsible; among the relevant personnel, Cao Gang, Director of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Sales Bureau, Cheng Qixing, Director of the former Ministry of Heavy Industry's Business Bureau, Zhang Dadian, Chief of the Supply Department, and Zhao Shuyang, Director of the current Ministry of Heavy Industry's Business Bureau, are more responsible; the leading organs are mainly responsible for the storage problem, but the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory also bears considerable responsibility. They should conduct inspections and make profound self-criticisms to learn lessons and improve their work. This batch of steel materials has now been tested and distributed with the cooperation and assistance of various parties. However, according to our understanding, the situation that some departments and factories and mining enterprises do not pay enough attention to the utilization and storage of valuable state materials is still not an isolated case. In order to safeguard state property, all departments should learn lessons from this incident and conduct an inspection of the maintenance and disposal of state materials.

### 前政务院人民监察委员会  关于四千余吨钢材积压问题的检查报告

    前政务院人民监察委员会
    关于四千余吨钢材积压问题的检查报告
    今年三月二十八日，本报发表了中央第一机械工业部财务会计司钱义格、田椿生的来信，揭发 中央重工业部有四千余吨钢材积压三年多，露天存放，给国家造成巨大损失的情况。
    对于这个事件，前政务院人民监察委员会已会同重工业部、国家物资储备局组成小组进行检查，分析了钢材积压的原因以及有关部门、有关人员应负的责任。同时，重工业部也会同第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部、国家物资分配局、国家物资储备局等单位成立处理小组，对这批钢材进行了化验和处理。现将前政务院人民监察委员会的检查报告摘要发表如下：
    一九五○年十月，中央重工业部向华东仓库物资清调分会领用了一批钢材，除陆续分配了一部分外，尚有四千多吨存放在山西太原、榆次两地。这批钢材长期积压，保管不善，给国家造成很大损失。
    根据这次处理小组化验鉴定和初步分析的结果，这四千五百余吨钢材，大部分都属于生产上通常使用的规格，如果积极处理，就能够及早被利用。其所以长期积压，锈蚀腐损，除客观上的一些困难外，主要是有关部门对国家物资不够重视，有的甚至采取了漠不关心的态度。
    首先，原重工业部经理司对这批钢材没有积极进行处理和分配，只是一再要求退货；加上一九五二年重工业部分部时没有具体移交，以致造成以后职责不明的情况。一九五○年底重工业部在上海请领这批钢材时是有着一些盲目性的。但是领取以后到一九五二年二月还没有对这批钢材进行化验、弄清成份，其中存放在榆次的二千余吨钢材亦未进行分配，就向前政务院财政经济委员会要求退料。同年四月，中央财政部召集有关单位开会，讨论议定：“已提走的物资不再退回，重工业部应尽力设法分配使用；其确实不能适用的部分由重工业部负责代管。尚未分配使用的由重工业部立即清理鉴定，按国内调拨价格计算，按使用的年度分别付款。”但是，重工业部经理司并没有执行这个决议，只是把钢材估价后交财务司处理账务手续。八月，重工业部在分部前又向中央财政部提出要求上缴。八月底重工业部改组时，没有确定这批钢材由那一个部负责处理。此后，这批钢材就处在无人负责的情况下。
    其次，有关部门对上级指示和各种协议不认真执行，互相推诿。一九五二年九月底前政务院财政经济委员会批复重工业部不同意退料，要重工业部设法利用并追究保管不当的责任。这个公文就在重工业部经理司和第一机械工业部供应局、财务司之间推来推去；当时这几个单位还在同一地点办公，也不互相联系协商，以致半个多月仍然没有结果。在物资管理总局督促下，虽然有关人员曾在十月份共同开会研究，提出这批钢材的化验分配工作由重工业部负责，保管工作由存放单位负责，财务工作由第一机械工业部财务司负责。但在会后各有关部门仍然互相推诿，钢材还是无人负责处理。
    最后，忽视对钢材的保管护养工作。一九五一年初钢材运到山西，但直到一九五二年重工业部分部前，重工业部并未对保管问题作具体指示。后来虽然确定了保管护养工作由物资存放单位负责，但第一机械工业部等都没有采取具体措施或向存放单位传达。在太原重型机器厂存放的钢材，因为工厂没有仓库，露天堆置，有不少陷入土中。职工群众多次提出意见，厂方起初并没有重视，只催上级赶快调走；到一九五三年八月，厂方提出要修盖临时库棚，国家物资储备局又不同意搭棚（直至今年二月才批准）。因此，钢材已普遍红锈，大部分有脱皮麻斑现象。存放在榆次的钢材，除大型方钢七百余吨因当时库房挤而曾作水泥垛逐层架空堆放露天外，其余都放在库中，损失较轻。根据处理小组估算，存放在两地的钢材因腐损（包括在华东存放时期的腐损）而受到的损失，按调拨价格计算约值二十四亿余元。
    以上情况说明，在处理这批钢材时，各有关单位及有关人员都程度不同地表现了对国家资财不负责任的错误。在有关单位中，原重工业部经理司、现重工业部销售局、现重工业部经理司责任较大；在有关人员中，重工业部销售局局长曹刚，原重工业部经理司司长程其兴、供应处处长张大巅，现重工业部经理司司长赵书扬责任较大；保管问题主要由领导机关负责，但太原重型机器厂亦有相当责任。他们应该进行检查和作深刻检讨，以吸取教训，改进工作。这批钢材现在已经化验，并在各方面配合协助下进行了分配。但是据我们了解，目前有些部门和厂矿企业对国家贵重物资的利用以及保管不够重视的情况，还不是个别的。为了维护国家资财，各部门应该从这次事件中接受教训，对国家物资的维护和处理工作进行一次检查。
