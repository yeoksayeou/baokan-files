    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 18th: On the 17th, elections for the People's Chamber, district people's congresses, and the Greater Berlin People's Assembly were held in a festive atmosphere throughout the German Democratic Republic.
    On this joyous election day, the streets of Berlin were adorned with the national flags of the German Democratic Republic and portraits of government and Socialist Unity Party of Germany leaders. At eight o'clock in the morning, more than eight hundred polling stations in Berlin began voting. However, before eight o'clock, the polling stations were already crowded with voters dressed in festive attire. The broad and magnificent Stalin Avenue was particularly lively. People living in the high-rise buildings on this street went to vote in groups, singing songs. Young people enjoying the right to vote for the first time walked joyfully at the head of the crowds.
    In the 33rd polling station in Berlin's Niederschönhausen district, President Wilhelm Pieck was the first to cast his vote at eight o'clock in the morning. Within minutes of President Pieck's vote, Prime Minister Grotewohl and Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht also cast their votes. At the polling station where President Pieck voted, 80 percent of the voters had completed their voting by 9:30 a.m.
    Throughout the Republic, voters participated just as enthusiastically. In Stalinstadt, the new city on the Oder-Neisse River, people began voting as early as 4:30 in the morning. Steel mill workers rushed to cast their votes before going to work. The first to vote were 25-year-old young steelworker Heinz Kietzing and his wife. He said to the polling station staff: "As a steelworker, I hope that the steel we produce serves the cause of peace, so I will elect the candidates of the National Front who lead us on the path of peace."
    In Zittau, the famous textile worker and labor hero, Frau Horkauf, was the first to cast her vote. In cities such as Leipzig, Halle, and Dresden, most voters had already cast their votes by noon. On the Baltic Sea, small motorboats with mobile ballot boxes sailed out of the harbor at dawn on the 17th to ensure that voters on the small islands at sea had the opportunity to vote.
    Members of agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers in various places also voted enthusiastically. In the German Democratic Republic, all the voters in 246 townships had completed their voting by 11 a.m.

    德意志民主共和国各地人民热烈进行选举
    【新华社柏林十八日电】十七日，德意志民主共和国全国各地在节日气氛中进行了人民议院、区人民代表大会和大柏林市人民代表会议的选举。
    在这个欢乐的选举日，柏林的大街上到处悬挂了德意志民主共和国的国旗及政府和德国统一社会党领袖的肖像。早晨八点钟，柏林市八百多个投票站开始投票。但是在八点钟以前，各投票站早就挤满了穿着节日服装的选民。宽广雄伟的斯大林大街特别热闹。住在这条街的高楼里的人们成群结队地唱着歌去投票。初次享有选举权的青年们兴高采烈地走在人群的前头。
    在柏林尼得森豪森区第三十三投票站里，威廉·皮克总统在早上八点钟第一个投了票。在皮克总统投票后的几分钟里，总理格罗提渥和副总理乌布利希也投了票。在皮克总统投票的投票站，上午九时半就有百分之八十的选民投完了票。
    在共和国各地，选民们参加投票的情形也一样踊跃。在奥得—尼斯河畔新建的斯大林斯塔特，早晨四时三十分就有人开始投票。钢铁厂的工人们赶着先投完票才去上班。第一个去投票的是二十五岁的青年炼铁工人海因斯·基青和他的妻子。他对投票站的工作人员说：“作为一个炼铁工人，我希望我们炼出来的铁为和平事业服务，所以我要选举领导我们走上和平道路的全国阵线的候选人。”
    在齐涛市，著名的纺织女工、劳动英雄霍考夫第一个投了票。在来比锡、哈雷和德累斯顿等城市，到中午大部分选民都已经投了票。在波罗的海上，放着流动投票箱的小汽艇十七日黎明就驶出了海岸，以保证海上各小岛的选民获得选举机会。
    各地的农业生产合作社社员和个体劳动农民也很踊跃地投票。德意志民主共和国各地有二百四十六个乡镇的全部选民在上午十一点就已经投完了票。
