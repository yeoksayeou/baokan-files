Farmers of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are enthusiastically selling oil crops to the state. By October 20th, the region had purchased over 20,000 tons of oil crops. In the eastern region, where oil crops mature later, over 1,000 tons of castor beans were purchased in twenty days. The Hetao Administrative Region exceeded its monthly plan by 3,900 tons in the first half of October. In the Ulanqab League, where rapeseed production is relatively high, the planned purchase for this year is 8,300 tons, and 78.3% of the plan had been completed by October 20th.

When selling oil crops, farmers of all nationalities are acting in accordance with the provisions of the pre-purchase contracts. Many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers are selling oil crops to the state in excess of their quotas. Zhang Ziyong, a farmer from Shuangshengmei Township in the Urat Middle and Rear United Banner, harvested a bumper crop of rapeseed on his 70 mu of land this year. In addition to selling 2,000 jin of oil to the state according to the original pre-purchase contract, he sold an additional 6,000 jin. (Xinhua News Agency)

Shandong Province, the largest peanut producer in China, has seen new peanuts enter the market one after another. Currently, in the Jiaozhou and Linyi Special Districts, where peanut harvesting and digging began earlier, the daily market volume of peanuts reaches over 500,000 jin in each area. Laiyang, Wendeng, and other places have also begun to enter the market.

The Shandong Provincial Company of China National Oils and Fats Corporation has made extensive preparations for the large-scale purchase of peanuts and the processing of peanut oil. State-owned oil and fat organizations have been established in all counties throughout the province. At the same time, peanut purchase contracts have been signed with grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in peanut-producing areas. The Shandong Provincial Oil and Fat Company's prepared 150,000 mats and 8 million burlap sacks and other packaging materials have begun to be allocated to various regions in batches. Currently, 50,000 mats and 2 million burlap sacks have been transported to grassroots peanut purchasing stations. Various oil and fat processing plants are about to vigorously process peanut oil. The first batch of 20,000 large oil drums has been transported to various oil and fat processing plants. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古自治区各族农民踊跃卖油料给国家
    产花生最多的山东省开始收购新花生
    内蒙古自治区各族农民正踊跃卖油料给国家。到十月二十日止，全区已收购油料二万多吨。油料作物成熟期较晚的东部地区，二十天内就收购了一千多吨蓖麻籽。河套行政区十月上半个月收购的数字，超额三千九百吨，完成全月计划。菜籽产量比较多的乌兰察布盟，今年计划收购八千三百吨，到十月二十日止已完成计划的百分之七十八点三。
    各族农民在出售油料时，都按照预购合同的规定办事。很多农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民都超额卖油料给国家。乌拉特中后联合旗双盛美乡农民张子永今年种七十亩油菜，获得了丰收。他除按原订预购合同卖给国家二千斤油料外，又卖了六千斤。（新华社）
    我国产花生最多的山东省，新花生已陆续登市。目前花生收刨较早的胶州、临沂专区，每天上市花生各达五十万斤以上。莱阳、文登等地也已开始上市。
    现在中国油脂公司山东省公司，已做好了大量收购花生和加工花生油的准备工作。全省各县普遍设立了国营油脂机构。同时和花生产区的各基层供销合作社签订了花生代购合同。山东省油脂公司准备的十五万张席子和八百万条麻袋等大批包装器材，已开始分批向各地调拨。现在已有五万张席子和二百万条麻袋运到花生基层收购站。各油脂加工厂快要大力加工花生油。第一批两万只大型盛油筒已运到各油脂加工厂。（新华社）
