    Kharkov Tractor Factory
    —Notes on a Visit to Ukraine, No. 13
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    In the fields of Ukraine, machines are working, plowing and harvesting; in the coal mines, machines are mining and transporting coal; on the railways, diesel locomotives are running; and in the power stations, turbine generators are spinning. In Kharkov, we saw factories capable of manufacturing these machines, as well as those needed by many sectors of the national economy.
    Kharkov, like Moscow and Leningrad, is a center of machine manufacturing in the Soviet Union. It supplies not only Ukraine but also various parts of the Soviet Union with all kinds of machines. Its machine manufacturing industry developed during the pre-war Five-Year Plans. The Kharkov Tractor Factory was built in 1931, the Kirov Turbine Generator Factory in 1932, and the Molotov Machine Tool Factory in 1935. The oldest, the Kharkov Locomotive Factory, was renovated and expanded. The output of the Stalin Electrical Machinery Factory and the Kirov Turbine Generator Factory alone in 1940 exceeded that of all industrial enterprises in the city in 1913. The output of the Molotov Machine Tool Factory alone in 1939-40 exceeded that of all machine tool factories in Russia in 1913. The industrialization of Kharkov was at the forefront of the country. During the war, the fascist aggressors destroyed this industrial city. After liberation, Kharkov was immediately restored from the ruins. In the first year, 1944, 247 factories were restored. The following year, 600 factories were operating. After the war, industrial enterprises were rebuilt and developed with newer technologies. Their diesel locomotives, tractors, machine tools, electric motors, steam turbines, and coal mining and transportation machines have surpassed pre-war levels in terms of quantity, variety, and quality. The machine manufacturing workers of Kharkov are striving to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    In the workshops of the Kirov Turbine Generator Factory, rows of vertical turret lathes and other machine tools are manufacturing turbine components. The factory manufactured two 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators for our country and sent engineers to China to help with installation. It is manufacturing two more of the same this year. According to factory director Pavel Georgievich Deyev, "The workers understand that it is an honor to manufacture machines for fraternal New China. They are wholeheartedly willing to fulfill China's orders. Many workers have asked the workshop directors to be assigned to this work." The factory is manufacturing hydraulic turbine generators for the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station. To support the consumer goods industry, the factory also manufactures bicycles as a sideline. The factory workers overfulfill their production plans. One worker used high-speed cutting methods to complete his quota up to 1968. The director said with a smile: He has already stepped into communist society.
    The Stalin Electrical Machinery Factory is also manufacturing many electrical equipment for our country. Here, we also encountered interns from Anshan, China. According to factory director Alexei Ivanovich Yakunin, "Not long ago, the factory sent two people to China to inspect the working conditions of our factory's products. They have already returned. The machines are working normally." The Stalin Electrical Machinery Factory manufactures electrical machinery for various industries. There are explosion-proof electrical equipment for coal mines, switchboards and control panels for power plants, and specialized electric motors for the steel and petroleum industries. To increase the production of consumer goods, the factory produces 4,000 electric fans, 10,000 electric stoves, and 30,000 electric irons every month.
    What made us feel the strength of machine manufacturing the most was the Kharkov Tractor Factory.
    The numerous workshops and buildings of the Kharkov Tractor Factory occupy a large part of the city of Kharkov. The factory buildings and the area where the workers live (workers from several other machine manufacturing factories also live there) have become a town. In this town, there are many multi-story residential buildings, twelve middle schools, five workers' night schools, a secondary technical school for machine manufacturing, a secondary technical school for agricultural mechanization (newly added after the September Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee), and a branch of the industrial college. In the residential area, there is a large workers' cultural palace and club, and more cultural palaces and Young Pioneer palaces are to be built. Between the factory buildings and the residential area, there lies a large park. The factory has its own clinic, and each workshop has a medical station. In addition, there is a well-equipped electrotherapy clinic in the factory, where two doctors and four nurses serve. It is open to workers for ten hours a day.
    The Kharkov Tractor Factory is one of the largest tractor factories in the Soviet Union. It arose and developed in response to the needs of agricultural collectivization and mechanization in Ukraine. During the First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union established tractor factories in Stalingrad, Kharkov, and Chelyabinsk, and agricultural machinery factories in Rostov and other places. The establishment of these iron bastions of agricultural collectivization illustrates the enormous role of heavy industry in agricultural collectivization. After the Kharkov Tractor Factory started operations on October 1, 1931, workers, administrative, and technical personnel quickly mastered the production technology, and by May 1932, it was able to produce 100 tractors per day. In the ten years from 1931 to 1941, it alone supplied socialist agriculture with 217,000 tractors.
    Before 1937, the Kharkov Tractor Factory produced wheeled tractors; from 1937, it took a step forward and switched to producing crawler tractors, initially using kerosene engines, and later gas generator sets. During the war, part of the factory's personnel went to Altai and established a new tractor factory. After the war, the destroyed Kharkov Tractor Factory was rebuilt according to the requirements of large-scale production. All basic and auxiliary workshops were equipped with new equipment. Among them, the casting conveyor belts, molding machines, many specialized machine tools, more than 500 casting and lifting transportation equipment, and thousands of instruments and tools were designed and manufactured by the factory's employees themselves. By July 1948, it had produced 15,000 post-war tractors, and its average daily output had exceeded the pre-war level by 26.5 percent.
    From 1949, the Kharkov Tractor Factory switched to producing the new "DT-54" crawler tractor with a diesel engine. In order to switch to the production of new machines without interrupting production, all employees, encouraged by the Party organization, mastered more than 5,000 operations, manufactured more than 10,000 kinds of molds, instruments, cutting and measuring tools, and manufactured more than 1,000 kinds of new parts. The "DT-54" tractors produced in large quantities by the factory save fuel much more than the original kerosene tractors. To plow one hectare of land, a kerosene tractor burns 23 or 24 kilograms of kerosene, while a diesel tractor burns only 16 kilograms of diesel, and diesel is cheaper than kerosene. This highly efficient, medium-sized "DT-54" tractor is the most widely used in Soviet rural areas today, and is praised by agricultural workers. Many tractor factories are manufacturing this tractor.
    In the assembly workshop of the Kharkov Tractor Factory, a series of manufactured "DT-54" tractors are continuously transported out from the automatic conveyor device. These all-purpose "steel oxen," resembling small tanks that we often encounter on the lands of Ukraine and the Volga River Basin, are lined up in groups on the square outside the workshop. The factory has a separate workshop producing the highly efficient "XT3-7" tire tractors in large quantities for vegetable gardens and orchards. Huge pictures of these two types of tractors are hung on the front wall of the factory building, and their models are placed on the desk in the director's office. The "XT3-12" electric tractor used by the Soviet electric tractor station is also manufactured by this factory. The factory also produces tractor parts in large quantities. XT3 is the abbreviation for Kharkov Tractor Factory, and its reputation is known far and wide.
    Large-scale production on highly efficient machine tools, combined with active labor by the employees, are the three major characteristics of the Kharkov Tractor Factory. According to Alexei Semyonovich Vanyushin, deputy secretary of the factory's Party committee, after the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee last year were announced, a high tide of increasing tractor production to strengthen support for agriculture was launched within the factory. Everyone put forward beneficial opinions and voluntarily undertook increased quotas. During the spring plowing season this year, the factory received the task of increasing the production of tractor parts by 60 percent. This task exceeded the factory's existing capacity, but under the tense efforts of the workers, who worked as if supporting the front line, it was finally fully completed. Factory director Pavel Yefimovich Shabliev told us that the factory increased its output by 23 percent and improved labor productivity by 18.6 percent in the first half of this year compared with the first half of last year. This is a large increase and improvement. In response to the Party's call, more than 100 workers from the factory went to the countryside, and many of them went to reclaim wasteland. The factory regularly provides voluntary assistance to two tractor stations and twelve collective farms.
    Among the diligent workers, many advanced workers who overfulfill their production tasks every year have emerged and are emerging. Vasily Pavlovich Dikan is one of the outstanding ones. We met him at his home. His wife was packing. Their whole family is preparing to go to Crimea for vacation in their own "Victory" car. Forty-nine-year-old Dikan, who is already a grandfather, looks very strong. Dikan has been working as a turner at the Kharkov Tractor Factory since the first day it opened. In 1931, he was a shock worker. In 1935, he was a Stakhanovite worker. During the war, he worked as hard as a frontline soldier. In 1949, he became a high-speed cutting worker. In the four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, he has already completed about nine years' worth of quotas. He imparts the high-speed cutting methods he has mastered to workers in his workshop and other workshops. He often goes to workers in other workshops and other factories to exchange experiences. Dikan is a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He responds to the trust of the workers with selfless labor and by handling the demands of his constituents well. Therefore, he was re-elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union this year. He said, "We, the Soviet people, look to the future with confidence, because we are creating the future ourselves."

    哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂
    ——乌克兰访问记之十三
    本报记者　李　何
    在乌克兰的田野上，活动着耕作和收割的机器，煤矿中工作着采煤和运煤的机器，铁道上行走着柴油机车，电力站内转动着透平发电机，我们在哈尔科夫看到了能够制造这些以及国民经济许多部门所需要的机器的工厂。
    哈尔科夫同莫斯科、列宁格勒一样，是苏联机器制造业中心。它不但供给乌克兰，而且供给苏联各地以各种机器。它的机器制造业是在战前五年计划时期发展起来的。哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂在一九三一年，基洛夫透平发电机制造厂在一九三二年，莫洛托夫车床制造厂在一九三五年建成。最老的哈尔科夫机车制造厂改造和扩大了。仅仅斯大林电气机械制造厂和基洛夫透平发电机制造厂在一九四○年的产量，就超过全市在一九一三年的工业企业。仅仅莫洛托夫车床制造厂在一九三九—四○年的产量，就超过俄国在一九一三年的所有车床制造厂。哈尔科夫的工业化速度，占居全国的前列。战时，法西斯侵略者毁坏了这座工业城市。在解放后，哈尔科夫立即从废墟中恢复起来。头一年，一九四四年，就恢复了二百四十七座工厂。第二年已有六百座工厂开工。战后，工业企业用更新式的技术重建和发展了。它们的柴油机车、拖拉机、车床、电动机、蒸汽透平、采煤运煤机器，不论在数量、品种和质量方面，都超过了战前。哈尔科夫机器制造业劳动者正在争取提前完成第五个五年计划。
    在基洛夫透平发电机制造厂的车间，成行的立式转塔车床和其他车床在制造透平机件。工厂替我国制造了两部发电力各五万瓩的蒸汽透平发电机，派了工程师到我国帮助安装。今年又制造两部同样的。据厂长巴维尔·格奥尔盖维奇·杰也夫说：“工人们了解为兄弟的新中国制造机器是光荣的。他们打从心坎愿意完成中国的订货。不少工人向车间主任要求做这项工作。”工厂为卡霍夫卡水电站制造着水力透平发电机。为了支援日用品工业，工厂附带制造自行车。工厂工人们超额地完成生产计划。有一位工人用高速切削方法，完成到一九六八年的定额。厂长含笑说：他已经走到共产主义社会。
    斯大林电气机械制造厂同样替我国制造着许多电气设备。在这里也碰到从鞍山来的我国实习生。据厂长亚列克塞·伊凡诺维奇·雅库宁说：“不久前，工厂派了两个人到中国察看本厂出品工作情形。他们已经回来。机器工作正常。”斯大林电气机械制造厂制造着各门工业用的电气机械。有供给煤矿用的能防爆炸的电气设备，有供给电力厂用的电盘和操纵台，有供给钢铁、石油工业用的专门的电动机。为了增加日用品的生产，工厂每月出产着四千个电风扇，一万个电炉和三万个电熨斗。
    最使我们感觉到机器制造业的力量的，是哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂。
    哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂众多的车间和厂内建筑物，占了哈尔科夫市的一大片地方。工厂厂房和工人们居住的地区（也有其他几个机器制造厂的工人住在那里）成了一座城镇。在这个城镇中，矗立着许多多层楼的住宅，设立着十二所中学，五所工人夜校，一所机器制造中等技术学校，一所农业机械化中等技术学校（苏共中央九月全会以后增设的），还有工业学院的分院。在住宅区有很大的工人文化宫和俱乐部，还要添造文化宫和少先宫。在工厂厂房和住宅区之间，横卧着很大的公园。工厂有自己的诊疗所，各车间有诊疗站。此外，厂内还有设备齐全的电疗所，两个医生和四个护士在那里服务。每天向工人开放十小时。
    哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂是苏联最大的拖拉机制造厂之一。它是应乌克兰农业集体化和机械化的需要而产生和发展的。在第一个五年计划中，苏联先后在斯大林格勒、哈尔科夫、车里雅宾斯克建立了拖拉机制造厂，在罗斯托夫和其他地方建立了农业机器制造厂。这些农业集体化的钢铁堡垒的建立，说明了重工业对农业集体化的巨大作用。哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂在一九三一年十月一日开工后，由于工人和行政与技术人员迅速地掌握了生产技术，在一九三二年五月已经能每天出产一百台拖拉机。从一九三一年到一九四一年的十年间，仅仅它一个厂就供给了社会主义的农业二十一万七千台拖拉机。
    在一九三七年以前，哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂出产车轮拖拉机；一九三七年起进了一步，改变为出产履带拖拉机，开始时用煤油发动机，后来用煤气发生装置。战时，工厂的一部分人到阿尔泰建立了新的拖拉机厂。战后，被破坏的哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂根据大规模生产的要求重建了。所有基本车间和辅助车间都装设新式设备。其中，铸造用的输送带、制模的机器、很多专门的车床、五百多件铸造和起重运输设备、几千件仪器和工具，是由工厂职工自己设计和制造的。到一九四八年七月，它出产了一万五千台战后的拖拉机，它的每昼夜平均产量已超过战前水平百分之二十六点五。
    从一九四九年起，哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂改变为出产新式的用柴油发动机的履带拖拉机“DT—五十四”。为了不停顿生产地转到生产新式机器，全体职工在党的组织的鼓励之下，掌握了五千多种操作，制造了一万多种模、仪器、切削和测量工具，制造了一千多种新机件。工厂大批生产着的“DT—五十四”拖拉机，比原来的煤油拖拉机大大节省燃料。耕一公顷土地，煤油拖拉机要烧二十三、四公斤煤油，而柴油拖拉机只烧十六公斤柴油，而且柴油比煤油便宜。这种高效率的中型的“DT—五十四”式拖拉机，在今天苏联农村使用最广，最受农业劳动者称赞，许多拖拉机制造厂都在制造这种拖拉机。
    在哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂的装配车间，一连串制造好的“DT—五十四”拖拉机川流不息地从自动输送装置上运出去。这些我们在乌克兰和伏尔加河流域的土地上常遇见的小坦克车似的万能“钢牛”，成群结队地排列在车间外面广场上。工厂有单独的车间大批出产效率极高的“XT3—七”式轮胎拖拉机，供给菜地和果园用。这两种拖拉机的巨幅图画挂在工厂建筑物的正面墙上，它们的模型摆在厂长办公室的桌上。苏联电气拖拉机站所使用的“XT3—十二”式电气拖拉机，也是由这个工厂制造。工厂也大批生产拖拉机的零件。XT3是哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂的简称，它的名气是远近知道的。
    规模宏大，在高效率的车床上进行大量流水作业的生产，职工积极地劳动，这是哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂的三大特色。据工厂党委员会副书记亚列克塞·谢明诺维奇·瓦纽新谈：去年苏共中央九月全会的决议公布以后，在厂内掀起了一个增产拖拉机以加强支援农业的高潮。人人都提出了有益的意见，自动担承了提高的定额。今年春耕时候，工厂接到了把拖拉机零件的生产提高百分之六十的任务。这个任务超过工厂现有的能力，但在工人如同支援前线工作一样紧张的努力下，终于完全完成了。厂长巴维尔·叶菲莫维奇·沙布列夫告诉我们：工厂在今年上半年与去年上半年比较，增加了产量百分之二十三，提高了劳动生产率百分之十八点六。这是很大的增加和提高。在响应党的号召的时候，工厂有一百多个工人下乡去，其中不少人去开垦荒地。工厂经常义务帮助两个拖拉机站和十二个集体农庄。
    在勤勤恳恳劳动的工人中，涌现了和涌现着许许多多每年超额完成生产任务的先进工人。瓦西里·巴甫洛维奇·狄干便是其中出色的一个。我们在他的家里会见了他。他的妻子正在收拾行装。他们全家准备乘着自备的“胜利”牌小汽车到克里木休养去。已经抱孙子的四十九岁的狄干显得还很强壮。从哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂开工的第一天起，狄干就在那里当镟工。他在一九三一年是突击队员。在一九三五年是斯塔哈诺夫式工作者。战时像前线战士一样紧张地劳动。一九四九年成为高速切削工人。在第五个五年计划的四年中，已经完成约九年定额。他把自己掌握的高速切削方法，传授给本车间和其他车间的工人。他常到别的车间和别的工厂的工人那里交谈经验。狄干是苏联最高苏维埃代表。他以舍己的劳动和很好地处理选民的要求，来答复劳动者的信托。所以他今年被连选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。他说：“我们，苏联人，满怀信心地看到未来，因为我们自己创造着未来。”
