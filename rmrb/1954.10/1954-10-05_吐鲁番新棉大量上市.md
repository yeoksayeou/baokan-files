	New Cotton from Turpan Enters the Market in Large Quantities
	The new cotton from the Turpan Basin in Xinjiang Province has entered the market in large quantities. This year, with the help of Soviet agronomists and local cotton technical guidance stations, people of all ethnic groups in the Turpan area have generally improved their cotton planting techniques, resulting in a very good cotton harvest. According to preliminary typical survey measurements, the average yield of lint cotton per mu is about 100 jin, and some cotton fields have an average yield of 450 jin of seed cotton per mu. The Xinjiang Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation has now signed a new cotton purchasing agreement with the Xinjiang Provincial Cooperative Bureau, and the cooperatives have begun purchasing.
	The Xinjiang Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and the Cooperative Bureau have made full preparations for the cotton purchasing work. In order to properly arrange the cotton ginning equipment in southern Xinjiang, the Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation studied the installation of hundreds of cotton ginning machines with relevant units in mid-August and equipped them with full-time cadres. After the new cotton entered the market, the provincial industrial and commercial administrative departments have strengthened market management to ensure that the state controls cotton and stabilizes cotton prices.
	While purchasing cotton, the Xinjiang Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation has also strengthened the supply of wadding cotton to people of all ethnic groups. At present, wadding cotton has been underwritten by cooperatives in various places, and the cooperatives have strengthened the processing of wadding cotton to ensure that urban and rural people in various places can buy the wadding cotton they need in a timely manner. The Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and cooperatives have long been prepared for the cotton cloth needed by people of all ethnic groups. In addition to importing various autumn and winter fabrics from East China, they have also actively organized local sources of goods. (Zhang Baolin)

    吐鲁番新棉大量上市
    新疆省吐鲁番盆地的新棉已经大量上市。今年吐鲁番地区的各族人民在苏联农学专家和当地棉花技术指导站的帮助下，普遍改进了种棉技术，棉花收成很好。据初步典型调查测定，该地区平均每亩可产皮棉一百斤左右，有一部分棉田平均每亩可产籽棉四百五十斤。现在中国花纱布公司新疆省公司已经和新疆省合作局签订了新棉代购协议，合作社已展开收购工作。
    新疆省花纱布公司和合作局对收购棉花工作作了充分准备。为了妥善安排南疆轧花设备，该省花纱布公司在八月中旬曾和有关单位研究安装轧花机数百部，并配备了专职干部。该省工商行政部门在新棉上市以后，为了保证国家掌握棉花和稳定棉价，已经加强了市场管理。
    在收购棉花的同时，新疆省花纱布公司还加强了对各族人民的絮棉供应工作。目前，絮棉已由各地合作社包销，合作社并加强了絮棉加工工作，以保证各地城乡人民能及时买到需要的絮棉。对于各族人民需要的棉布，该省花纱布公司及合作社都早已作了准备，除从华东地区调进各种秋冬季布匹外，还积极组织了地方货源。（张宝林）
