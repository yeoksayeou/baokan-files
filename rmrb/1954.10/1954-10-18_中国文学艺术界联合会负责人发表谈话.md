The responsible person of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued a statement regarding the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué, saying: The national literary and art workers welcome and support the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué with extreme excitement. The further comprehensive cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and the principles put forward by the two governments for developing international cooperation and safeguarding world peace, not only fully conform to the unanimous wishes and common interests of the 800 million people of the two countries, but also conform to the fundamental interests of the people of Asia and the people of all countries in the world. For world peace, this is a further guarantee; and for the enemies of peace, it is another heavy blow. Now, as we are striving to build a socialist society in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people are giving us even further meticulous and large-scale comprehensive assistance. Our gratitude cannot be expressed in words. We literary and art workers can only respond to our great ally with action, with redoubled efforts, and with solid creative labor results.

    中国文学艺术界联合会负责人发表谈话
    中国文学艺术界联合会负责人就中苏会谈公报发表谈话说：全国文学艺术工作者以极度兴奋的心情欢迎、拥护中苏会谈的公报。中苏两国进一步的全面合作，两国政府所提出的发展国际合作和维护世界和平的原则，不仅完全符合两国八万万人民的一致愿望和共同利益，同时也是符合亚洲人民和世界各国人民的根本利益的。对世界和平来说，这是进一步的保证；而对和平的敌人，则是又一次沉重的打击。现在，当我们正按照宪法的规定，努力建设社会主义社会的时候，苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民又更进一步给我们以无微不至的巨大规模的全面援助，我们的感激的心情真不是言词所能表达的。我们文学艺术工作者只有以行动，以加倍的努力，以结实的创造性的劳动成果，来回答我们伟大的盟友。　　　　　（新华社）
