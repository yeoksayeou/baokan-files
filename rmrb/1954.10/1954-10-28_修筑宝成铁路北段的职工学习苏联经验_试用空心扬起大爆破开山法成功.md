Workers of the First Engineering Section of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, learning from advanced Soviet experience, recently conducted four large-scale blasts on three mountains in succession, blasting away more than 16,000 cubic meters of stone, saving over 100 million yuan in construction costs, and shortening the construction period by one month.

The workers of the First Engineering Section were constructing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in the Qinling Mountains, where they had to blast away many hard rocky mountains, fill in countless deep gullies, and move millions of cubic meters of stone and soil to smoothly build the railway. In the past, they used the old method of manual drilling and blasting to open mountains and remove rocks, which was very inefficient; one person working hard all day could not even remove one cubic meter of stone. Especially because the mountains were high, the roads were narrow, and the work surface was small, it could not accommodate many workers, so many earthwork and stonework projects in the first half of the year were not completed according to the stipulated construction period. In order to accelerate the progress of the project, the leadership proposed learning from advanced Soviet experience and implementing large-scale mountain blasting. The workers enthusiastically responded to this call and firmly guaranteed to the Party: "We will not come down from the mountain until we successfully detonate the large blast!"

In the process of implementing large-scale mountain blasting, the workers continuously improved their working methods and increased work efficiency and blasting effectiveness. In September, they further studied advanced Soviet experience and tried a more advanced method of blasting and mountain opening—the hollow uplift large-scale blasting method. The results of the experiment proved that this blasting method has many advantages: it is not only powerful, but also, according to people's will, it can use the power of the explosion to throw the blasted and crushed stones to nearby places that need filling, and even leave no stone where filling is not needed. There are many places like this on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway that require both excavation and filling. The successful trial of this blasting method will play a huge role in accelerating the progress of the project and saving construction costs for the country.

The workers of the First Engineering Section are now actively planning another larger-scale blasting and mountain opening operation. This time, they plan to load fifty or sixty tons of explosives, blasting away more than 100,000 cubic meters of stone in one go, and throwing the blasted stones to places where a large amount of filling is needed.

### 修筑宝成铁路北段的职工学习苏联经验  试用空心扬起大爆破开山法成功

    修筑宝成铁路北段的职工学习苏联经验
    试用空心扬起大爆破开山法成功
    铁道部第六工程局第一工程段职工学习苏联先进经验，最近在三个山头连续进行了四次大爆破，共炸掉一万六千多方石头，节约工程费用一亿多元，并使工期缩短一个月。
    第一工程段职工在宝成铁路秦岭地段施工，在那里必须炸掉许多坚硬的石山，填平无数条深沟，移动千百万方石头和沙土，才能把铁路顺利地修通。他们在过去采用人工打眼放炮开山去石的旧方法，工作效率很低，一个人努力的干一天还搞不掉一方石头。特别是由于山高路窄工作面小，不能容纳很多的工人，所以上半年许多土石方工程都没有按规定工期完成。为了加速工程进度，领导上提出学习苏联先进经验，实行大爆破开山，职工们热烈地响应这一号召，向党坚决保证：“放不响大炮，决不下山！”
    在实行大爆破开山的过程中，工人们不断改进工作方法，提高了工作效率和爆破效力。九月份，他们又进一步学习了苏联先进经验，试用了更先进的爆破开山方法——空心扬起大爆破法。试验的效果证明：这种爆破法的好处很多，它不仅威力大，同时还能根据人们的意志，借着爆炸的威力，把炸开、炸碎的石头，抛到就近需要填土石方的地方，而不需要填方的地方甚至可以不落一块石头。宝成铁路北段像这样既要挖方又要填方的地方很多，这一爆破方法的试验成功，对加快工程进度，为国家节省工程费用将会起巨大的作用。
    第一工程段职工现正积极筹划另一次更大的爆破开山工作。这次爆破准备装进五六十吨炸药，一次就要炸掉十万方以上的石头，并要把炸开的石头抛到需要大量填方的地方去。
