    State-Owned Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory Establishes Comrades' Court
    With the help of the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Court, the State-Owned Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, after more than a month of preparation, established a comrades' court for production enterprises in mid-July.
    Since the State-Owned Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory implemented planned management in January of this year, although the production situation has gradually improved, due to lax labor discipline within the workforce, there have been continuous occurrences of responsibility accidents and violations of operating procedures, which have affected the improvement of labor productivity.
    In mid-June, the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Court sent cadres to the factory and jointly with the factory's Party Committee, administration, and trade union departments, organized a preparatory committee for the comrades' court for production enterprises, and launched publicity work among the workers and masses in various forms. Initially, because the workers did not understand the nature and role of the comrades' court, some people had various ideological concerns and some incorrect understandings. Some people thought it was "rectifying the workers" and were fearful; others thought they usually followed the rules and would not be subject to the court, and were indifferent to the establishment of the comrades' court. After detailed explanations of the nature, tasks, role, and scope of authority of the comrades' court, these incorrect understandings were gradually corrected. In this way, the comrades' court was successfully established.
    After the comrades' court was established, it began to work. They first selected typical events with representative significance, did a good job of investigation and research, and individually conducted ideological education for the employees who made mistakes to dispel their concerns, and then convened a meeting of the comrades' court to discuss the handling opinions. On the basis of education and consciousness, a trial meeting was finally held. Through the trial meeting, the vast number of workers were educated on abiding by labor discipline and cherishing state property with vivid facts. In this way, not only were those who made mistakes able to correct them quickly, but also the ideological awareness of all employees was improved, which promoted production. Wei Baizhi, a worker who used to be passive and lazy in his work, also underwent a significant change under the educational influence of the comrades' court. Xiu Jiang, a fine yarn maintenance worker, reflected: "It is really good to have a comrades' court in the factory. It can solve problems in a timely manner, not only educating those who make mistakes, but also educating everyone."
    At present, the comrades' court has formulated a work plan for the future based on the factory's central work, focusing on reducing cotton consumption, implementing the responsibility system, and further strengthening labor discipline.

    国营郑州第二棉纺织厂建立同志审判会
    国营郑州第二棉纺织厂在郑州市人民法院的帮助下，经过一个多月的筹备工作，于七月中旬成立了生产企业同志审判会。
    国营郑州第二棉纺织厂从今年一月开始实行计划管理后，生产情况虽然逐渐好转，但在工人内部，由于劳动纪律松懈，不断地发生责任事故和违犯操作规程等现象，因而影响了劳动生产效率的提高。
    六月中旬，郑州市人民法院派干部来厂，和该厂党委会、行政、工会等部门共同组织了生产企业同志审判会筹备委员会，采用各种形式在职工群众中展开了宣传工作。开始，因为职工们不了解同志审判会的性质和作用，一部分人曾产生了各种思想顾虑及一些不正确的认识。有的人认为是“整工人的”，心存畏惧；有的则认为自己平常就守规矩，审判不到头上来，对建立同志审判会的事漠不关心。经过详细地说明了同志审判会的性质、任务、作用以及职权范围，这些不正确的认识才逐渐得到了纠正。这样，同志审判会便顺利地成立了。
    同志审判会成立后，便着手进行工作。他们先选择了具有代表性的典型事件，做好调查研究工作，并对犯错误的职工个别地进行思想教育，解除顾虑，再召开同志审判委员会讨论出处理的意见。在教育和自觉的基础上，最后召开审判大会。通过审判大会，用生动的事实向广大的职工群众进行遵守劳动纪律和爱护国家财产的教育。这样，不但使犯了错误的人能够很快地改正过来，并且提高了全体职工们的思想觉悟，推动了生产。过去经常消极怠工的工人魏柏枝在同志审判会的教育影响下，也有了显著的转变。细纱保养工段秀江反映说：“厂里有了同志审判会真好，能及时解决问题，不仅教育了犯错误的人，也教育了大家。”
    目前，同志审判会已根据厂里的中心工作，围绕着降低用棉量、贯彻责任制和进一步加强劳动纪律等工作，制订了今后的工作计划。
