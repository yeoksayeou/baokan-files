    The joint declaration by the democratic parties and people's organizations of the People's Republic of China for the liberation of Taiwan represents the common will and firm determination of 600 million people. After the publication of this great and just declaration, it was immediately warmly embraced and resolutely supported by the people of the whole country. People from all over the country, including workers, peasants, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, cadres of government organs, cultural and educational workers, and young students, have enthusiastically written to this newspaper, solemnly expressing their unwavering will to fight for the liberation of Taiwan.

    The letters from people across the country prominently demonstrate the Chinese people's profound love for their motherland and their strong determination to defend it. From these letters, it can be seen that the great Chinese people, who have achieved freedom and independence through long and heroic struggles, cherish their revolutionary achievements and love their national system and new life. The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never allow American imperialism to occupy our territory and undermine our sovereignty, nor will they allow the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to continue to harm the country and the people. Even more, they cannot tolerate the U.S. war-mongering group directing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to wage harassing and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas, and the conspiratorial crimes that threaten peace in the Far East and the world. The people correctly point out that only by liberating Taiwan can the sacred cause of liberation of the Chinese people be finally completed. Hui Wen, a reader from Shapingba, Chongqing, wrote: "The will of the liberated Chinese people to love every inch of the motherland's land is harder than steel." Zhu Wencai, the mutual aid team leader of the Ninth Village, Shima Township, Mianyang County, Sichuan, said: "Taiwan is our Chinese territory, and not an inch of it can be allowed to be sold to the United States by the Chiang Kai-shek traitor." These simple and powerful voices represent the sincere aspirations of every Chinese person.

    The letters from people across the country point out that they clearly know that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique continues to occupy Taiwan and, under the direction of the United States, intensifies its harassing and destructive wars against our mainland and coastal areas. This not only directly endangers the security of the motherland and hinders our socialist construction, but also increases the danger of a new war in the Far East and threatens world peace. As Li Dongliang and other comrades from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army said: "As long as Taiwan is not liberated for a day, the socialist construction of the motherland will not be safe for a day; as long as the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not eliminated for a day, peace in the Far East will still be threatened." Ye Qingquan of Beijing Geological College wrote: "Chiang Kai-shek is the root of the Chinese people's troubles. If we don't eliminate him for a day, our lives will not be peaceful for a day." The people in the southeastern coastal areas have written many letters to denounce the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's bloody crimes of invading the motherland's territory and slaughtering the motherland's people. The letter from all the people of Dongmen Island, Xiangshan County, Zhejiang, stated: "The Chiang bandits constantly send bandit planes to harass our Xiangshan area, directly threatening our production and safety. In July of this year, the Chiang bandit planes shamelessly bombed our islands. These blood debts must be repaid." A letter of complaint from all the maritime workers of Haimen Port, Zhejiang, said: "The Chiang bandit army often shells and intercepts our ships, killing and persecuting our maritime workers. We have reached the point of unbearable tolerance for the crimes of the Chiang bandit army." Countless letters have shown that without liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the Chinese people cannot enjoy a peaceful life. The struggle for the liberation of Taiwan carried out by the Chinese people, who are engaged in peaceful and constructive labor, is a struggle to defend the security of the motherland and to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    The liberated Chinese people express their deep sympathy and concern for the Taiwan compatriots who are under the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique; they express their extreme anger at the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in cruelly suppressing and persecuting Taiwan compatriots. Many readers' letters earnestly express their sincere feelings for the Taiwan compatriots. Chen Zhenwei of a certain armored unit of the Northeast Military Region said: "Whenever I think of the disasters suffered by the Taiwan compatriots, my heart aches like a knife." Chen Kunfu of the Wenzhou Administration Office of the Zhejiang Shipping Administration Bureau wrote: "For five years, we have been concerned about the tragic situation of our dear eight million Taiwan compatriots, just as the Taiwan compatriots look forward to liberation day and night." Readers' letters suggest that in order to rescue the Taiwan compatriots in dire straits as soon as possible, we must wage a resolute struggle for the liberation of Taiwan. Zhu Wencai from Shima Township, Mianyang County, Sichuan, said: "Taiwan compatriots are our own brothers and sisters, and we are determined to help them liberate themselves from the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!" This is a deep love for the people of the motherland and a lofty sense of responsibility, and it is also the common wish of the Chinese people.

    The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a great patriotic movement. This struggle has greatly inspired the people of the whole country, sparked the surging political and labor enthusiasm of the masses, and become a new and powerful driving force for promoting various tasks. In their letters, people from all over the country have proposed to support the struggle for the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions of increasing production, practicing thrift, strengthening unity, and heightening vigilance. The letter from all the workers of the Kang Yongxiang rapid tunneling team of the Nanguan Pit of the Shanxi Fujiatan Coal Mine stated: "We unanimously believe that producing more coal and using less materials is to support the struggle for the liberation of Taiwan. We hope to quickly send the coal we mined to steel factories, the steel to ordnance factories, and the weapons and ammunition to the front lines, so that every bullet hits the chest of the Chiang bandit army." The letter from all the employees of the Xijiufu State-owned Farm in Zhangwu County, Liaoning Province, proposed: to increase the yield by another five dou of rice per hectare on the basis of the original output, produce more rice, support the country's industrial construction, and support the struggle for the liberation of Taiwan. They excitedly said: "We want to make our dearest people - the People's Liberation Army - eat well, be strong, and continue to win victories." Readers from all over the country have put forward many specific methods for increasing production and practicing thrift to support the liberation of Taiwan in their letters. The young comrades have all proposed guarantees in their letters, to intensify physical exercise, study hard, and prepare to respond to the call of the motherland at any time.

    The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a just cause, and a just cause is bound to win. People from all over the country have expressed in their letters with full confidence that they are convinced that the Chinese people will be able to accomplish the sacred task of liberating Taiwan. The letter from the People's Liberation Army soldiers Chen Junying and Lin Bing stated: "With the support of the people, we have the determination, courage, and confidence to liberate Taiwan."

    The people's letters also stated that they are clearly aware that the liberation of Taiwan is a complex and serious struggle. The people of the whole country must strengthen unity, strengthen work in all aspects, overcome all difficulties, strive for the victory of every combat mission, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan and the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!

    解放台湾是中国人民的不可动摇的意志——读者来信综述
    中华人民共和国各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言，代表着六万万人民的共同意志和坚定决心。这个伟大的正义宣言发表后，立即受到全国人民的热烈拥护和坚决支持。全国各地人民，包括工人、农民、解放军指战员、机关干部、文化教育工作者、青年学生等，纷纷热情地写信给本报，郑重地表达他们为解放台湾而奋斗的不可动摇的意志。
    各地人民的来信，突出地表现了中国人民热爱祖国的丰富感情和保卫祖国的坚强决心。从这些来信中可以看到，经过长期的英勇斗争而取得了自由和独立的伟大的中国人民，十分珍视自己的革命果实，热爱自己的国家制度和新的生活。站起来了的中国人民，决不容许美帝国主义侵占我国的领土和破坏我国的主权，决不容许蒋介石卖国集团继续祸国殃民，更加不能容忍美国好战集团指使蒋介石卖国集团对中国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争、威胁远东和世界和平的阴谋罪行。人民群众正确地指出：只有解放台湾，才能最后完成中国人民神圣的解放事业。重庆沙坪坝读者惠文来信说：“解放了的中国人民热爱祖国每一寸土地的意志比钢还硬。”四川绵阳县石马乡第九村互助组长朱文才说：“台湾是我们中国的领土，一尺一寸都不能让蒋介石卖国贼出卖给美国。”这些朴实而有力的声音，代表着每一个中国人民的真切愿望。
    各地人民的信中指出：他们清楚地知道，蒋介石卖国集团继续盘踞台湾并在美国指使下加紧对我国大陆和沿海地区进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，这不仅直接危害祖国的安全，妨碍我国的社会主义建设事业，而且增加了远东新战争的危险，威胁世界的和平。正如解放军某部李栋樑等同志所说：“台湾一天不解放，祖国的社会主义建设就一天不安全；蒋介石卖国集团一天不消灭，远东的和平就一天仍受着威胁。”北京地质学院叶庆全来信说：“蒋介石是中国人民的祸根，一天不把他消灭，我们的生活就一天不能安宁。”东南沿海地区的人民，更纷纷来信控诉蒋介石卖国集团侵扰祖国领土和屠杀祖国人民的血腥罪行。浙江象山县东门岛全体人民的来信说：“蒋贼不时派遣匪机来骚扰我们象山地区，直接威胁我们的生产和安全。今年七月间，蒋贼飞机就曾无耻地对我们岛屿进行轰炸。这些血债必须偿还。”浙江海门港全体海员工人来信控诉：“蒋贼军经常炮轰和拦劫我们的船只，残杀和迫害我们海员工人。我们对于蒋贼军的这种罪行，已到了忍无可忍的地步。”无数的来信都说明：不解放台湾，不消灭蒋介石卖国集团，中国人民便不能安享和平的生活。而正在从事和平的建设性劳动的中国人民所进行的解放台湾的斗争，就是保卫祖国安全和保卫远东与世界和平的斗争。
    解放了的中国人民，对于处在蒋介石卖国集团血腥统治下的台湾同胞，表示深切的同情和关怀；对于蒋介石卖国集团残酷镇压和迫害台湾同胞的罪行，则表示极端愤怒。许多读者的来信都恳切地表达了他们对于台湾同胞的真挚感情。东北军区装甲兵某部陈振威说：“一想起台湾同胞所遭受的灾难，我的心里就像刀绞一样地难过。”浙江航运管理局温州管理处陈堃甫来信说：“五年来，我们时刻关怀亲爱的八百万台湾同胞的悲惨处境，正如台湾同胞日日夜夜盼望解放一样。”读者来信提出，为了早日拯救水深火热中的台湾同胞，我们一定要为解放台湾而进行坚决的斗争。四川绵阳县石马乡朱文才说：“台湾同胞是我们的亲兄弟，我们决心要帮助他们从蒋介石卖国集团的黑暗统治下解放出来！”这是对于祖国人民的亲密感情和崇高责任观念，也是中国人民的共同的心愿。
    中国人民解放台湾的斗争，是一项伟大的爱国主义运动。这一斗争已经大大地鼓舞了全国人民，掀起了人民群众高涨的政治和劳动热情，并成为推动各项工作的新的强大动力。各地人民的来信中，纷纷提出要以增加生产、厉行节约、加强团结、提高警惕的实际行动，来支援解放台湾的斗争。山西富家滩煤矿南关坑康永祥快速掘进一大队全体工人的来信说：“我们一致认为：多出煤、少用料，就是支援了解放台湾的斗争。我们希望很快地把自己掘下的煤送到钢铁厂，把钢送到兵工厂，把武器和弹药送到前方，让每颗子弹都打中蒋贼军的胸膛。”辽宁省彰武县西旧府国营农场全体职工来信提出：要在原有产量的基础上，每垧再增产五斗稻，多产大米，支援国家工业建设，支援解放台湾的斗争。他们兴奋地说：“我们要使最亲爱的人——人民解放军吃得好、力气壮，不断地打胜仗。”各地读者在来信中提出了许多增产节约、支援解放台湾的具体办法。青年同志们在来信中都纷纷提出保证，要加紧锻炼身体，努力学习，准备随时响应祖国的号召。
    中国人民解放台湾的斗争，是正义的事业，而正义的事业是必定要胜利的。各地人民都满怀信心地来信表示，他们确信：中国人民一定能够完成解放台湾的神圣任务。解放军战士陈俊英、蔺冰的信说：“在人民的支持下，我们有决心、有勇气、有把握解放台湾。”
    人民群众的来信中也同时表示，他们清楚地知道：解放台湾是一场复杂的严重斗争。全国人民必须加强团结，从各方面加强工作，克服一切困难，争取每一个战斗任务的胜利完成，为解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗！
