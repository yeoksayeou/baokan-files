Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, October 29th: The Xinjiang Branch of the CCP Central Committee and the Xinjiang Military Region Committee of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently jointly issued a decision on strengthening the assistance of the agricultural production and construction troops stationed in Xinjiang to all ethnic groups of farmers in carrying out an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation.

The decision pointed out: In the past, the agricultural production and construction troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, in addition to maintaining social order and consolidating the border defenses of the motherland, under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, vigorously assisted farmers of all ethnic groups in successfully completing tasks such as rent reduction and land reform, and were sincerely loved and grateful by farmers of all ethnic groups. In the future, the agricultural production and construction troops stationed in Xinjiang, in addition to striving to do a good job in the agricultural and animal husbandry production of the troops, striving to achieve regularized state-owned farms as soon as possible, and actively creating and preparing favorable conditions for large-scale industrial construction after the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, should also undertake the glorious task of vigorously assisting farmers of all ethnic groups in carrying out an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation, and systematically assist local party committees and governments in running mutual aid and cooperation organizations, improving production technology, and increasing yields. This is of great political and economic significance for supporting the industrial construction of the motherland, promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture, realizing the national economic plan, gradually improving the living standards of all ethnic groups, further strengthening military-civilian relations, and strengthening national unity.

The decision stipulates that assistance should be given to farmers of all ethnic groups in carrying out the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in the following aspects: (1) Divide regions and conduct technical guidance. The targets of guidance are mainly cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and individual farmers should also be appropriately taken care of. (2) Assist in training technical personnel. (3) Transfer a group of cadres to establish technical guidance stations and assist in the work of establishing cooperatives.

The decision also stipulates that all agricultural production and construction troops, on the premise of continuing to do a good job in their own animal husbandry operations, should actively assist farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in improving livestock feeding management, improving livestock breeds, and developing animal husbandry production. And under the unified leadership of the local party committee, promote the steady development of animal husbandry mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

The decision pointed out: In the work, it is necessary to implement the party's ethnic policies, strictly abide by the customs and habits of all ethnic groups, vigorously train local ethnic technical personnel, and strictly prohibit any behavior that violates ethnic policies and ethnic customs and habits.

    决定中还规定，各农业生产建设部队在继续办好自己经营的畜牧业的前提下，要积极援助各族农牧民改进牲畜饲养管理，改良牲畜品种，发展畜牧业生产。并在当地党委统一领导下，促进畜牧业互助合作组织的稳步发展。
    决定中指出：在工作中要贯彻执行党的民族政策，严格遵守各民族的风俗习惯，大力培养本地民族技术人员，严禁任何违反民族政策和民族风俗习惯的行为。
