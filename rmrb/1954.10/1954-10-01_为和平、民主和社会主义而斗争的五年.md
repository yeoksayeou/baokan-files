    Five Years of Struggle for Peace, Democracy, and Socialism

    All the Chinese people are immersed in jubilation today, celebrating the glorious and great fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. These are five years of heroic struggle and brilliant victories for the Chinese people for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    China has undergone more profound and richer changes in the past five years than in the previous hundred years of history.

    The imperialist ruling position in China has been completely overthrown. The Chinese people have used their iron broom to sweep away the political, economic, and cultural forces of imperialism in China. Except for Taiwan, the Chinese people have become masters on all their land.

    The feudal land system that existed in China for two to three thousand years collapsed in the storm-like land reform movement. More than 300 million landless and land-poor peasants received approximately 700 million mu of land and other large amounts of means of production. Agricultural production exceeded the highest pre-liberation level in 1952 and has been growing year by year. Farmers have established 100,000 production cooperatives and are preparing to expand this type of cooperative to 500,000 next spring.

    The People's Government confiscated the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital that colluded with imperialism and feudalism, while establishing and developing socialist state-owned enterprises. Modern industry has developed rapidly. New industrial construction is being carried out on a large scale. The socialist economy has a significant advantage in both industry and commerce. The proportion of output value of state-owned, cooperative-operated, and joint state-private industrial enterprises in the total national industrial output value will reach 71 percent this year.

    The people's lives have been significantly improved in the past five years. The long-term continuous rise in prices has stabilized. Unemployment has been greatly reduced. The income of workers and peasants has increased significantly. The people's cultural and health conditions are improving year by year.

    For the first time in history, the Chinese people have achieved true unity and established a democratic country. The government belongs to the people and is no longer opposed to the people. Equal and friendly relations have been established between all nationalities, and ethnic minorities enjoy broad regional autonomy in their places of habitation.

    On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the First National People's Congress held its first session. The constitution formulated at this meeting summarized the victories of the Chinese people in the past five years, determined the path for China to build a socialist society, stipulated the people's democratic political system at the central and local levels, and stipulated the people's basic rights and their guarantees.

    All of this explains why the people across the country are celebrating the fifth anniversary of the People's Republic of China so enthusiastically. The people can clearly see that the People's Republic of China has brought them a happy life that is changing with each passing day. The people can clearly see that since we have already obtained such great happiness in the few years of transition to a socialist society, then after the successful establishment of a socialist society, after the complete elimination of exploitation and poverty, how happy our lives should be, and how strong and progressive our country should be.

    All of this also explains why the people across the country have shown such surging enthusiasm in their labor, why the representatives of the people have shown such a high degree of unity at the recent congress meeting, and why the people's representatives and the people themselves have shown such sincere trust, love, and respect for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    A people united to struggle for their own happiness is invincible. The history of the People's Republic of China in the past five years has once again proven this universal truth. Today, five years later, even many imperialist fortune-tellers who determined in 1949 that the cause of the Chinese people was bound to fail admit that the People's Republic of China is consolidated, and admit that those adventurers who still want to deny this fact are foolish.

    Six hundred million people overthrew the rule of imperialism and established their own country, embarking on the path of peace, democracy, and socialism, which of course cannot but change the face of the world. The balance of power between the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism and the camp of aggression, reaction, and imperialism has undergone significant changes.

    The People's Republic of China has established an unbreakable friendship with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The fundamental interests of the people of all countries are inherently consistent, and they inherently need to be friendly and support each other. However, the ruling classes of various countries in the imperialist world, for their own selfish interests, set up various obstacles and created discord among the people of various countries. These obstacles and seeds of discord no longer exist within the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The people of all countries in the socialist camp have common interests and common goals. This is the solid foundation of the great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. This foundation is completely natural and can be understood by any normal person. In the past five years, the Soviet Union has given the People's Republic of China huge and generous selfless assistance in all aspects, especially in economic construction, helping the Chinese people overcome many difficulties and accelerating China's progress. We must never forget this brotherly friendship. The friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and all other people's democratic countries are also constantly developing. The friendship between the People's Republic of China and these countries serves the interests of world peace and has made well-known contributions to the cause of world peace.

    The victory of the Chinese people has received widespread attention among the oppressed nations in Asia and elsewhere, which is completely natural and inevitable. It is not difficult for any oppressed nation to see its own way out from the Chinese example. Therefore, they want to understand China and develop friendly relations with the Chinese people. Indeed, it is very difficult to convince people that being oppressed by imperialism is more "free" and "safe" than not being oppressed; it is equally difficult to convince people that those who send their ferocious military forces to the ends of the earth are not aggressors and "infiltrators," but rather the most gentle nannies of the oppressed nations. The Chinese people have never and will never learn from these "nannies," but no one has the power to prohibit the oppressed nations from sympathizing with China. "Peach and plum trees do not speak, yet a path is formed beneath them." This ancient Chinese saying is not wrong.

    The People's Republic of China is willing to coexist peacefully with all countries in the world and is willing to establish diplomatic relations with any country, including the United States, on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. However, China's liberation, China's standing on the side of peace, democracy, and socialism, and the spread of China's influence among the oppressed nations have all extremely angered the actual rulers of Kuomintang China before 1949 and the main enemy of world peace, US imperialism. In order to oppose the Chinese people, the US government organized a large-scale war of aggression in Korea and prevented the liberation of the Vietnamese people and the peaceful settlement of the Vietnamese question. These have been defeated due to the resolute resistance of the Chinese people, the Korean people, the Vietnamese people, and the peace-loving people of all countries in the world, led by the Soviet people. However, the frantic US imperialists not only continue to implement policies hostile to the People's Republic of China, such as arming Japan, organizing the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty Organization," refusing a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, imposing an embargo on China, and depriving China of its position in the United Nations, but also intensified their support for the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan to attack the Chinese mainland, attempting to subvert the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people resolutely oppose these imperialist policies and acts of aggression by the US government and are determined to fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of peace in the Far East.

    When the Chinese people cheer for the fifth anniversary of the founding of their country, they have not forgotten that our work is only beginning, that our achievements are insignificant compared to the tasks we need to accomplish, that we are still very backward economically and culturally, and that we face the tasks of completing socialist construction and socialist transformation, and the tasks of liberating Taiwan and resisting US imperialist aggression. The Chinese people cannot forget Comrade Mao Zedong's following instructions:

    "Our general task is: to unite the people of the whole country, to strive for the support of all international friends, to struggle for the building of a great socialist country, and to struggle for the defense of international peace and the development of human progress.

    Our people should work hard, diligently study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, be honest and conscientious, encourage and help each other, avoid any boasting and pride, and prepare to build our current economically and culturally backward country into a great industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture within a few five-year plans." Uniting as one and carrying out a tenacious struggle to implement this instruction—this is our best commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of our country.

### 为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的五年

    为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的五年
    全中国人民在今天都浸入了狂欢，庆祝光荣伟大的中华人民共和国成立五周年。这是中国人民为和平、民主和社会主义而英勇斗争并取得了辉煌胜利的五年。
    中国在过去五年内经历了比以前历史上一百年还更深刻更丰富的变化。
    帝国主义在中国的统治地位被彻底地推翻了。中国人民用自己的铁扫帚扫除了帝国主义在中国的政治势力、经济势力和文化势力。除了台湾以外，中国人民已经在自己的全部土地上做了主人。
    在中国存在了两三千年的封建土地制度在暴风骤雨般的土地改革运动中覆亡了。三亿以上的无地少地的农民分得了约七亿亩土地和其他大量的生产资料。农业生产在一九五二年就超过了解放前的最高水平，并且在逐年增长着。农民已经建立起十万个生产合作社，并且准备在明年春季把这种合作社发展到五十万个。
    人民政府没收了同帝国主义、封建主义狼狈为奸的国民党官僚资本，同时建立和发展了社会主义的国营企业。现代工业有了迅速的发展。新的工业建设正在大量地进行着。社会主义的经济在工业和商业中都已占有显著的优势。国营、合作社营和公私合营工业的产值在全国工业总产值中所占的比重在今年将达到百分之七十一。
    人民的生活在过去五年中得到了重要的改善。长期不断上涨的物价稳定了。失业现象极大地减少了。工人和农民的收入都有很大的增加。人民的文化状况和卫生状况一年比一年进步。
    中国人民在历史上第一次完成了真正的统一，建立起一个民主的国家。政府属于人民而不再同人民相对立了。各民族之间建立了平等友爱的关系，各少数民族在聚居的地方享受广泛的区域自治权。
    在中华人民共和国成立的五周年纪念前夜，第一届全国人民代表大会举行了第一次会议，在这个会议上制定的宪法总结了中国人民过去五年的胜利，确定了中国建立社会主义社会的道路，规定了中央和地方的人民民主的政治制度，规定了人民的基本权利和它们的保证。
    所有这些，都说明了全国人民为什么这样热烈地庆祝中华人民共和国的五周年。人民看得清楚，中华人民共和国给自己带来了日新月异的幸福生活。人民看得清楚，既然我们在开始向社会主义社会过渡的几年中间就已经得到这样大的幸福，那么，在社会主义社会建立成功以后，在完全消灭了剥削和贫困以后，我们的生活该是怎样美满，我们的国家该是怎样强盛和进步。
    所有这些，也就说明了全国人民为什么在自己的劳动中表现出这样奔腾澎湃的热情，说明了全国人民的代表为什么在最近的代表大会会议上表现出这样高度的团结一致，说明了人民的代表和人民本身为什么对于中国共产党的领导表现了这样真诚的信任和爱戴。
    团结起来为创造自己的幸福而奋斗的人民是不可战胜的。中华人民共和国过去五年的历史又一次证明了这个普遍的真理。在五年以后的今天，甚至有许多在一九四九年断定中国人民的事业必然失败的帝国主义算命先生们也承认中华人民共和国是巩固的，承认那些还想否认这个事实的冒险分子是愚不可及的了。
    六亿人民推翻了帝国主义的统治而建立起自己的国家，而走上和平、民主和社会主义的道路，当然不能不改变世界的面貌。和平、民主、社会主义的阵营和侵略、反动、帝国主义的阵营的力量对比发生了显著的变化。
    中华人民共和国同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家建立了牢不可破的友谊。各国人民的根本利益本来是一致的，他们本来需要互相友好和互相支援，但是帝国主义世界里的各国统治阶级却为着自己的私利，在各国人民中间设置各种障碍，制造各种不和。这些障碍和不和的种子在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营中间是不再存在了。社会主义阵营各国人民有共同的利益和共同的目标。这就是中华人民共和国同苏联和各人民民主国家之间的伟大友谊的巩固基础，这个基础是完全自然的，是任何正常的人都能够理解的。过去五年中苏联在各方面特别是经济建设方面给了中华人民共和国巨大的慷慨无私的援助，帮助中国人民克服了许多困难，加速了中国的进步，这种兄弟般的友谊我们永远不能忘记。中华人民共和国同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和其他一切人民民主国家的友好关系，也都在不断地发展着。中华人民共和国同这些国家的友谊，都服从于世界和平的利益，并且对世界和平事业作了举世周知的贡献。
    中国人民的胜利在亚洲和其他地方的被压迫民族中受到了广泛的注意，这也是完全自然的，不可避免的。凡是被压迫的民族都不难从中国的例子里看到自己的出路，因此他们要求了解中国，要求同中国人民发展友好的关系。真的，要使人们相信受帝国主义的压迫比不受帝国主义的压迫更为“自由”和“安全”是十分困难的；要使人们相信把自己的穷凶极恶的武力派到天涯海角的人不是侵略者和“渗透”者，反而是被压迫民族的最温柔的保姆，也是同样地困难。中国人民从来不曾也永远不会向这些“保姆”学习，但是谁也没有力量禁止被压迫民族对中国的同情。“桃李无言，下自成蹊”，这句中国的古话并没有说错啊。
    中华人民共和国愿意同世界上一切国家和平共处，并且愿意在平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则下同任何国家，包括美国在内，建立外交关系。但是中国得到了解放，中国站在和平、民主、社会主义方面，中国的影响在被压迫民族中间的传布，这些都极端地激怒了一九四九年以前的国民党中国的实际统治者和全世界和平的主要敌人美帝国主义。为了反对中国人民，美国政府在朝鲜组织了大规模的侵略战争，并且阻止越南人民的解放和越南问题的和平解决。这些都由于中国人民、朝鲜人民、越南人民和以苏联人民为首的世界各国爱好和平的人民的坚决反抗而失败了。但是发了狂的美帝国主义者不但仍然执行着武装日本、组织所谓“东南亚防务集团”、拒绝朝鲜问题的和平解决、对中国实行禁运和剥夺中国在联合国地位等等敌视中华人民共和国的政策，而且变本加厉地支持着台湾的蒋介石卖国集团向我国大陆进攻，企图颠覆中华人民共和国。中国人民坚决反对美国政府的这些帝国主义政策和侵略行为，决心为解放台湾和保卫远东和平而奋斗到底。
    中国人民在欢呼自己的国家成立五周年的时候决没有忘记，我们的工作只是在开始，我们的成就比起我们需要完成的任务来说还是微乎其微的，我们在经济上和文化上还很落后，我们面对着完成社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务，面对着解放台湾、抵抗美帝国主义侵略的任务。中国人民不能忘记毛泽东同志的下列指示：
    “我们的总任务是：团结全国人民，争取一切国际朋友的支援，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗，为了保卫国际和平和发展人类进步事业而奋斗。
    我国人民应当努力工作，努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，准备在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家。”团结一致，为执行这个指示而进行顽强的斗争——这就是我们对于我国成立五周年的最好的纪念。
