Creating More and Better Movies
National People's Congress Representative
Stalin Prize Winner Xu Xiaobing

    Being elected as a representative to the National People's Congress is the greatest excitement and pleasure of my life, and also the highest honor. I know that this honor should belong to all of us people's film workers.
    From the day I was elected as a people's representative, I have been very apprehensive and ashamed. Because, although I have been serving the people's film cause, and although I love this cause as much as I love my own life, the role I can play is insignificant. If in my creative activities over the years, there is some positive significance and practical influence, it is mainly due to the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, the party's continuous cultivation, and the help and joint labor of other comrades.
    In the vigorous War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, we film workers have always stood in the most glorious positions. For five years, we have strived to follow the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have produced relatively excellent films such as "Daughter of China," "Zhao Yiman," "Million-Strong Army Crosses the Yangtze River," "The White-Haired Girl," "Iron Warrior," "New Children's Heroes," "People's Warrior," "Red Flag on Cui Gang," "Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia," "Taking Huashan Mountain Intelligently," "The Butterfly Lovers," "Red Flag Waves Westward," "Triumphant Song of the Great Southwest," "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities," "The First Film of Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea," and "Vietnam in the War of Resistance." These films have inspired hundreds of millions of viewers, enabling them to receive collectivist education, as well as patriotic and internationalist education, from the screen. The masters of our country—the workers, peasants, and soldiers—have begun to become the masters on the screen. The heroic images of the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Communists—and their noble qualities of dedicating their loyalty to the cause of people's liberation have become role models for hundreds of millions of people in their lives and work. Since the advent of Chinese cinema, it has never played such a huge role and exerted such great power as it does now.
    At the same time, we have also exported films to the world, strengthening cultural exchanges between our country and other countries, allowing audiences around the world to vividly understand the heroic spirit of the 600 million Chinese people in building their motherland and defending peace. Most of the films mentioned above have won various awards at previous international film festivals. In particular, "The Victory of the Chinese People" and "Liberated China," co-produced with the Soviet Union, were honored with the Stalin Prize.
    According to the general line and general tasks put forward by the Party, the country has fully launched an unprecedentedly grand socialist construction. Whether in factories, mines, farms, or schools; whether in remote border areas or any corner; almost every day countless mythical heroes emerge, and amazing miracles are created at any time; everything means: changing the face of the motherland, which is really changing with each passing day. For us film workers, these are our creative objects. We are truly fortunate to face such a broad, rich, and profound creative world.
    However, we must admit that our political level and artistic accomplishment are really poor, and we still cannot accurately apply the creative principles of socialist realism. Some films show a lack of Party spirit and mass viewpoint; a lack of combat atmosphere and life atmosphere; and a lack of natural and beautiful charm. This is why some films do not get a strong resonance or response from the audience. All cold treatment is not accidental. The audience's demands on us are strict, but also reasonable. Obviously, the key lies in ourselves, in the fact that our political and artistic cultivation is far from adequate.
    I know that creating more and better movies is a difficult task. It is not easy to make our films satisfying to the audience. This is the responsibility of us film workers, and as a film worker, I have such a responsibility.

    创造更多更好的电影
    全国人民代表大会代表
    斯大林奖金获得者  徐肖冰
    我能当选为全国人民代表大会代表，这是我一生中最大的兴奋和愉快，也是无上的荣誉。我知道，这荣誉应该属于我们全体人民电影工作者。
    我自己从被选为人民代表那一天起，一直是非常地惶恐和惭愧。因为，尽管我一直为人民电影事业服务，尽管我像热爱自己的生命一样热爱这一事业，然而我所能起到的作用，那是微不足道的。这些年来如果在我的创作活动中，还包含一些积极的意义和实际影响，最主要的就是由于得到毛主席的文艺思想的指导、党的不断培养、其他同志的帮助和共同劳动所得到的。
    在轰轰烈烈的抗日战争、解放战争和抗美援朝运动中，在祖国各项事业的建设中，我们电影工作者一直站在最光荣的岗位上。五年以来，我们努力遵循为工农兵服务的方向，制作了像“中华女儿”、“赵一曼”、“百万雄师下江南”、“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”、“新儿女英雄传”、“人民的战士”、“翠岗红旗”、“内蒙人民的胜利”、
  “智取华山”、“梁山伯与祝英台”、“红旗漫卷西风”、“大西南凯歌”、“中国民族大团结”、
  “抗美援朝第一部”、“抗战的越南”比较优秀的影片，激励了上亿的观众，使他们从银幕上得到集体主义教育，得到爱国主义和国际主义教育。我们国家的主人——工农兵开始成为银幕上的主人翁。中国人民最优秀的儿女——共产党员们的英雄形象和他们的赤胆忠心献身给人民解放事业的高贵品质，已经成为亿万人民在生活中和工作中的榜样。中国有电影以来，从来没有像现在这样地起如此巨大的作用，发挥如此巨大的威力。
    同时，我们也把影片输送到全世界，加强了我国和各国的文化交流，让全世界观众形象地认识中国六亿人民在建设祖国保卫和平的事业中的英雄气概。上面所提到的那些影片中，大部分都在历届国际电影节中得到各种奖。特别是与苏联联合摄制的“中国人民的胜利”、“解放了的中国”并且光荣地获得斯大林奖金。
      国家根据党所提出的总路线和总任务，已经全面地展开了空前浩大的社会主义建设，无论在工厂、矿山、农庄和学校；无论在遥远的边疆和任何一个角落；几乎每天都要涌现无数像神话一样的英雄人物，随时都在创造惊人的奇迹；一切都意味着：改变祖国的面貌，真是日新月异的。对我们电影工作者来说，这些都是我们的创作对象。我们面对着这样广阔的、丰富而深刻的创作世界，真是我们的幸运。
    可是，我们必须承认自己的政治水平和艺术修养实在很差，我们还不会准确地运用社会主义现实主义的创作原则。有些影片，表现出缺乏党性和群众观点；缺乏战斗气息和生活气息；缺乏自然和美的魅力。这就是为什么有的影片在观众面前得不到强烈的共鸣或反应的原因。一切冷淡的待遇都不是偶然的。观众对于我们的要求，是严格的，也是合情合理的。显然，关键在于我们自己，在于我们的政治修养和艺术修养还差得很远。
    我知道，创作更多更好的电影，是一件繁难的事情。使我们的电影，让观众感到满足，是很不容易的。这就是我们电影工作者的责任，我作为一个电影工作者，就负有一份这样的责任。
