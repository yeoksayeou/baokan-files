Column: Wuhan People Overcome the Greatest Flood in History

    Nineteen Thirty-One and Nineteen Fifty-Four
  　By our reporter Cao Baoming
    In the past century, the people of Wuhan have suffered two particularly severe floods: one in 1931 and one in 1954.
    In the summer and autumn of 1931, all three towns of Wuhan were submerged in the floodwaters. At the end of July, the Yangtze River floodwaters, breaking through the single-arch railway bridge opposite Zhongshan Park, surged directly into the city of Hankou. Unprepared citizens climbed to the upper floors of buildings if they had them, or onto rooftops if they didn’t, and those with low houses climbed up trees; children cried and mothers wailed, and the entire city was plunged into chaos. At that time, the water depth at the single-arch gate was fourteen or fifteen feet, and the water on Zhongshan Avenue and at the Jianghan Customs House was also four or five feet deep, turning the bustling city into a water town. Boats, doors, and wooden basins replaced vehicles, and the windows of buildings became docks for boarding and disembarking. Dead bodies floated down the streets from time to time. In the three or four days after the flood entered the city, more than a thousand floating corpses were recovered.
    In 1954, the people of Wuhan created a historical miracle. Floodwaters, one to two stories higher than the ground, were consistently blocked outside the solid dikes, and the power of the violent winds and waves was also halved by the wave-resistant wooden rafts known as the "water Great Wall." Many factories along the river, such as the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, had flood levels higher than their factory windows, but the workers continued production. The drilling ship of the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau continued to drill for rock cores from the riverbed in the turbulent river. Shops remained open as usual. Loudspeakers at street corners broadcast heroic songs from time to time. On Sundays, Zhongshan Park was full of tourists. On the Mid-Autumn Festival evening, the people of Wuhan still prepared mooncakes and fruits, and families gathered together to enjoy the moon.
    Two floods, two results. Why is this? Was this year's flood smaller? No. This year's flood was a flood unseen in a century, 1.45 meters higher than the highest water level in 1931 (28.28 meters). Did this year's flood come later? No. This year's flood exceeded the Wuhan warning water level in late June, more than a month earlier than in 1931. Did this year's flood recede faster? No. The flood in 1931 only reached 28.28 meters for one day, while this year it exceeded this water level from July 18 and continued at the highest historical water level for 58 days. What exactly is the reason? An old woman named Zhao Guangcai, who experienced both floods, explained the problem in one sentence. She said:
  "These are two different societies! Our country is now run by our people, run by Chairman Mao. With a good leader, everything is different from before!"
    Since Wuhan built dikes during the Qing Dynasty, a "dike work donation" specifically for repairing dikes was added to the customs duties, collecting nearly one million silver dollars a year. Initially, a very small portion of this money was used on the dikes, but later none of it was used. Where did the silver dollars go? The bankruptcy case of the Hankou "Chuanjianglong" opium den revealed the truth: it was given by He Chengjun, the puppet governor of Hubei Province, to merchants to sell opium to poison the people. Later, it was openly transferred by the bandit Chiang Kai-shek to be used as military expenses for the civil war to slaughter the people. On July 15, 1931, the Jinlulu breach occurred, and the reactionary rulers ignored it. When the Danshuichi breach of 260 meters occurred on July 30, causing panic throughout the city, He Chengjun, Liu Wendao, Xia Douyin, and several other reactionary ringleaders were gambling at the home of the general manager of the "Jiji Hydroelectric Company." When their subordinates reported to them, they thought there was still a railway embankment blocking it and that it didn't matter, so they continued gambling. Soon, the floodwaters from Danshuichi broke through the single-arch railway bridge and submerged the entire city of Hankou. Only then did they set up a nominal Wuhan Disaster Prevention Office, and ordered their subordinates to use the only ten manpower waterwheels and three temporary ten-horsepower water pumps to "drain the city's floodwaters into the river within three days." How absurd!
    During the flood in 1931, the puppet government itself claimed that the mobilized force was only several hundred workers, ten waterwheels, three water pumps, five thousand hemp bags, and twenty thousand catties of reeds. Much of these materials were embezzled by them. When the Danshuichi breach of 26 meters occurred at 5:30 a.m. on July 30, only two or three hundred workers went to the rescue in a scattered manner, and there were no materials available; whatever was needed was lacking. By 10:00 a.m., the flood had broken through the second gap, 260 meters wide, and the floodwaters, several feet above the ground, poured straight into the inside of the dike. Three wooden boats that had passed the outer river were also sucked into the breach and sank. It was this flood that swept away the lives and property of millions of people in the entire city of Hankou.
    After the birth of New China, all kinds of dike donations were abolished, but an unprecedented water conservancy project was launched across the country: harnessing the Huai River, Guanting Reservoir, and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project are all world-famous large-scale projects. The people of Wuhan also witnessed the People's Government spending great efforts every year to repair the long-dilapidated Da and Xiao Zhanggong dikes. Since June 27 this year, Wuhan has launched a comprehensive flood prevention effort. Two hundred and thirty thousand workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, students, and cadres, under the call of the Party, went to the dikes. In the office of Wuhan Acting Mayor Wang Renzhong, there were long-distance telephone calls from Beijing every day, and the responsible comrades of the Central Committee kept abreast of the flood prevention situation in Wuhan and gave instructions. Wuhan Municipal Party Secretary Zhang Pinghua, who fell ill from fatigue during flood prevention, continued to insist on working in the hot weather. He and many deputy flood prevention commanders worked from 8:00 p.m. to 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. every night, and as soon as it dawned, they were busy setting off to inspect the dikes.
    During the flood prevention period, when the Wuhan Flood Prevention Headquarters sent telegrams to any place, the local Party committees and people's governments tried their best to meet Wuhan's requirements overnight. More than 2.7 million cubic meters of mud and stones were transported from Shekou, Qijiawan, and other places dozens of miles away; if all of them were loaded onto trains, they could stretch from Hankou all the way to Beijing. There were 392 water pumps supported by the whole country, with 12,000 horsepower; the amount of water they discharged in two months and five days averaged four loads per person for the nation's 600 million people, allowing all the farmland submerged by accumulated water to be exposed. In addition, there were 6 million hemp bags, 4 million grass bags, 4 million catties of reeds, and 160,000 pieces of timber, as well as more than 1,000 cars, 55 ships, 30 locomotives, and 640 railcars. Navy divers transported by Air Force aircraft, a train power station transferred from North China, and levee workers from the Yellow River also participated in Wuhan's flood prevention. Relying on this strong manpower and material resources, the people of Wuhan comprehensively thickened and strengthened more than 100 kilometers of dikes, and universally raised them to more than 30.5 meters; and built wave-resistant wooden rafts extending more than 90 li outside the dikes.
    In those days of constantly rising floods and violent storms, in order to ensure the security of Wuhan, an important town in the middle of our country, the farmers in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area and Honghu voluntarily requested flood diversion to weaken the flood. More than 200,000 flood prevention and rescue personnel were on guard on the dikes day and night, and hundreds and thousands of cars, trains, and ships were rushing to transport flood prevention materials non-stop. At 11:00 a.m. on July 29, huge waves caused the collapse of more than 20 meters of the Danshuichi dike surface, but due to adequate preparation, more than 1,000 rescue team members went to the dangerous area within five minutes. More than 70 people immediately jumped into the water to form a "human dike" and used their bodies to block the wind and waves, while the people behind them braved the storm to move stones and transport sacks, and the breach was blocked in 40 minutes.
      During the flood disaster in 1931, the puppet Hankou Mayor Liu Wendao and others colluded with large merchants to hoard grain, cloth, and many daily necessities, and even collected all the effective medicines for treating dysentery. Prices soared. Rice rose from one dime to two dimes and two cents per liter, and it was difficult to buy even with money. The puppet government took the opportunity to implement "cuts, reductions, and mergers," dismissing many public and educational personnel who depended on salaries for a living. The salaries of those who remained were also discounted by 30 to 40 percent, and they were in arrears for six months. Under the guise of "maintaining治安" (zhì ān, public order), the puppet garrison commander Xia Douyin and Chief of Staff Ye Peng "requisitioned" boats as soon as they saw them. Those who could bribe them with money could be released, and those who couldn't were requisitioned and then rented to large merchants for high prices. Finally, they extorted 20,000 silver dollars from the people for "boat patrol fees."
    In 1931, the people suffered from natural disasters and were also subjected to heavy exploitation and oppression by the reactionary rulers. According to the puppet government, there were "more than 500,000" disaster victims in Wuhan who were in urgent need of relief. These victims gathered on the railway embankment and in the wilderness of Heishan and Hongshan. The sun was scorching above and water vapor was steaming below. They had escaped with their lives in a panic, and the little clothing they had at home was washed away by the floods. At this time, there was nothing to eat and nothing to drink, and many people relied on salvaging aquatic plants for food. Many pregnant women gave birth to children in the wilderness or in dilapidated thatched sheds, and were even forced to flee everywhere by the puppet police who considered them "obstructing order." At that time, the city's feces and dirty water had nowhere to be disposed of and were dumped into the nearby water, causing mosquitoes and flies to gather and the stench to fill the air; and the victims still drew water from this dead water to drink. As a result, cholera, typhoid, dysentery and other epidemics spread, and dead people could be seen everywhere. In the disaster areas of Heishan and Hongshan, the disaster victims who died of hunger and disease could not be buried in time, so several mass graves were dug, layer upon layer. According to statistics from the puppet Hubei Flood Relief Committee and others from August to the following April, they buried 32,605 disaster victims. The actual number of deaths was much higher than this.
    During the Wuhan flood prevention period in 1954, the state carried out planned allocation and fully supplied Wuhan with grain, oil, salt, coal, meat, cloth, and daily necessities. The vegetables, which had once been in short supply, were also supported by the whole country. Cabbage from Taiyuan, winter melon from Jiangxi, potatoes from Inner Mongolia and Northeast China, pickled mustard tuber from Sichuan, and pickled mustard greens from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, as well as many bean products and egg products, were continuously transported here, and the vegetables on the market every day were about the same as on weekdays. In order to deliver these necessities to the people in a timely manner, and at the same time as the busy transportation of flood prevention equipment, trucks continuously transported rice and flour to the city's 180 supply stations. Workers in rice and flour processing plants milled rice and flour day and night. In the waterlogged areas in the suburbs and on the dikes, more than 300 workers from state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives personally carried peddler's loads, pushed handcarts and tricycles, and steered small boats to deliver grain, oil, salt, and vegetables to mobile supply stations. Prices in Wuhan remained stable and people's lives remained normal.
    In order to prevent and eliminate the epidemic diseases caused by the flood in a timely manner, the People's Government carried out large-scale drinking water disinfection, sewage disposal, fly and mosquito eradication, and vaccination, and organized 1,800 medical personnel (including 341 doctors) to provide free treatment for flood prevention personnel and people affected by waterlogging. Most of the medical teams not only treated during the day, but also went to the work sheds at night to cover the workers with quilts, arrange mosquito nets, and established close friendships with everyone. Doctors Gao Guangshu and Wen Yiqi also researched and developed an effective method to treat acute high fever caused by excessive sweating, which was widely promoted throughout the city.
    Zhao Jiancai, an old woman who had lived in the Juxiang (street name) near Wuhan Customs for more than 30 years, took her five-year-old daughter and three-year-old son to her grandmother's house in Hanyang in 1931 to escape the flood; as a result, the dike in front of her grandmother's house also broke, and they fled to the wilderness and lived there for two days and two nights. During this year's flood, her daughter and son and daughter-in-law were all working in factories and went to work as usual every day. Only she and her old partner were left at home to take care of their four grandchildren, and their lives were very stable. Huang Shiting, a resident near Danshuichi, had his entire family submerged in the flood in 1931, and he only managed to save a broken mosquito net; this year, his family still lived in the same old place and celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival peacefully. According to Hubei folk customs, his family ate glutinous rice balls in the morning, drank wine at noon, and ate mooncakes in the evening, and the whole family enjoyed a happy reunion life.
    The families in a small number of waterlogged areas and those submerged by water outside the dikes were all resettled by the People's Government one by one. Those who had difficulties in life were also given relief by the government; the government helped them drain the accumulated water, organized them to produce for self-rescue, and rebuild their homes. The Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau also established 38 delivery rooms in these affected families, and welcomed a total of 597 new little citizens to the motherland. Deng Fengying, a resident of Xima Street whose home was flooded twice, recalled the situation when she gave birth to a child in a dilapidated thatched shed by the railway in 1931: she hadn't eaten or drunk for a few days, and once, her family managed to grab two black buns, but they fell into the water... She was so hungry that she couldn't bear it. This year, when her daughter-in-law gave birth, the Union Hospital took her away by ambulance before delivery, and after delivery, there was sugar water and hot noodles... The things supplied by the government could not be eaten and drunk. She excitedly asked someone to write a letter to her son, instructing him to "guard the dikes well, protect Wuhan, and thank Chairman Mao." Zuo Fenglin, a third-grade student at Shuren Elementary School, had her home flooded, and the People's Government placed her family in the Municipal No. 8 Girls' Middle School, and she continued to do her summer homework as usual. When doing the "...not only...but also..." connection sentence, she wrote: "The People's Government is so good, not only did it help us move out of the flooded place, but it also took care of our lives and sent doctors to treat us."

专栏：武汉人民战胜了历史上的最大洪水

    一九三一年和一九五四年
  　本报记者　曹葆铭
    近百年来，武汉人民遭到两次特大的洪水袭击：一次在一九三一年，一次在一九五四年。
    在一九三一年夏天到秋天，武汉三镇都被淹没在大水里。七月末，冲破了中山公园对面铁路单孔的长江洪水，直向汉口市内汹涌奔来。毫无准备的市民有楼的上楼，无楼的上屋顶，房矮的爬上树梢；儿哭娘嚎，全市陷入一片混乱。那时候，单洞门水深一丈四、五，中山大道和江汉关的水也有四、五尺深，繁华的市区变成了一座水城。划子和门板、木盆代替了车辆，楼房的窗口成了上下船只的码头，街道上时有死尸漂过。在洪水进市的三、四天中，捞起的浮尸便有一千多具。
    在一九五四年，武汉人民创造了历史的奇迹。高出平地一丈至两丈的洪水始终被挡在坚固的堤防之外，狂风巨浪的威力也被那称为“水上长城”的防浪木排削减了一半。国营武汉第一棉纺织厂和江岸机车车辆修理工厂等许多沿江沿河的工厂，洪水位比厂房的窗户还高，而工人们依然坚持着生产。长江大桥工程局的钻探船，一直在波涛滚滚的大江中钻取江底的岩心。商店照常营业。街口的扩音器不时播出雄壮的歌声。星期日，中山公园里充满了游人。中秋节的晚上，武汉人民依然备办了月饼和水果，家人们团聚在一块赏月。
    两次洪水，两种结果。这是为什么呢？是今年的洪水小些吗？不是的。今年的洪水是百年未有的洪水，它比一九三一年的最高水位（二八点二八公尺）还高一点四五公尺。是今年的洪水来得迟些吗？不是的。今年的洪水六月下旬便超过了武汉警戒水位，比一九三一年早一个多月。是今年的洪水退得快些吗？也不是的。一九三一年的洪水只有一天达到了二八点二八公尺，而今年从七月十八日起就超过了这个水位，一直在历史最高水位上持续了五十八天。究竟是什么原因呢？经历了两次洪水的老太婆赵光才用一句话说明了这个问题。她说：
  “这是两个不同的社会呀！我们国家如今是我们人民当家，是毛主席当家，有了好当家的，什么事都跟从前不一样啦！”
    武汉从满清修筑堤防以来，便在海关附加了专门用来培修堤防的“堤工捐”，一年要收近百万的银元。这笔钱最初还有很小一部分用到堤上，过后就一点也没用上。银元到哪里去了呢？汉口“川江隆”烟膏店破产的案件泄露出了真相，原来被伪湖北省主席何成浚交给商人贩卖毒害人民的鸦片去了。后来又被蒋贼介石公开调去充作屠杀人民的内战军费。一九三一年七月十五日分金炉决口，反动统治者并不理会。当七月三十日丹水池决口二百六十公尺，全市人心惶惶的时候，何成浚、刘文岛、夏斗寅等几个反动头子正在“既济水电公司”总经理家里赌钱。他们的部下去向他们作报告，他们认为还有铁路埂挡住，不要紧，仍旧赌下去。不久由丹水池进来的洪水冲破了铁路单孔，淹没了汉口全市，他们才成立起有名无实的武汉防险处，并且限令他们的部下用那仅有的十部人力水车和三部临时租来的十匹马力的抽水机，“在三天之内，将全市洪水排入江中”。这是多么荒诞的事啊！
    在一九三一年洪水期间，据伪政府自己宣称，所动员的力量，只是数百名工人、十部水车、三部抽水机与五千条麻袋、两万斤芦柴。其中许多物资还被他们贪污中饱了。当七月三十日早晨五点半钟丹水池溃口二十六公尺时，只有两三百名工人零零落落地前去抢救，并且没有材料，要什么缺什么。挨到十点钟，洪水又冲开了第二个口子，二百六十公尺宽，高出平地数尺的洪水往堤内直涌，经过外江的三只木船也被吸进缺口沉没了。也就是这股洪水席卷了汉口全市千千万万人民的生命财产。
    新中国诞生以后，各种堤防捐都取消了，但全国兴起了空前未有的水利工程：根治淮河，官厅水库和荆江分洪都是世界著名的大工程。武汉人民也亲眼看见人民政府每年花大力量来培修年久失修的大小张公堤。从今年六月二十七日起，武汉便展开了全面的防汛工作。工人、农民、解放军、学生和干部，一共二十三万人，在党的号召下，走上了堤防。武汉市代市长王任重的办公室里，每天都有北京的长途电话，中央的负责同志随时了解着武汉防汛情况，并给予指示。在防汛中累病了的武汉市委书记张平化，大热天里继续坚持工作。他和许多防汛副指挥每天从晚上八点工作到次晨两三点钟，天一明，又忙着出发巡视堤防去。
    在防汛期中，武汉防汛指挥部向任何地方发出电报，当地的党委和人民政府便连夜设法满足武汉的要求。单是从数十里外的滠口、祁家湾等地运来的泥土和石头，便有二百七十多万方，如全部装上火车，可从汉口一直排到北京。全国支援的抽水机有三百九十二台，一万二千匹马力；它们在两月零五天中所排除的水量，全国六亿人每人平均得挑四担，使渍水所淹的农田全部露出了水面。另外还有六百万条麻袋、四百万个草包、四百万斤芦柴和十六万根木料，还有一千多辆汽车、五十五艘轮船、三十个火车头和六百四十个车皮。由空军飞机载送来的海军潜水员、由华北调来的列车发电站和来自黄河的埽坝工人，也都参加了武汉防汛。就靠着这雄厚的人力、物力，武汉人民把一百多公里长的堤防全面加厚加固，同时普遍加高到三十点五公尺以上；在堤外修建了长达九十多里的防浪木排。
    在那洪水不断上涨和狂风暴雨的日子里，为了确保我国中部的重镇——武汉，荆江分洪区和洪湖的农民都主动要求分洪，减弱水势。二十多万防汛抢险人员日夜警戒在堤防上，成百上千的汽车、火车和轮船一刻不停地抢运着防汛器材。七月二十九日中午十一点钟，巨大的风浪使丹水池的堤面崩塌了二十多公尺，但由于事前准备充分，在五分钟之内，一千多名抢险队员都上了险地。七十多人立即跳下水去结成“人堤”，用身体挡住风浪，后面的人便冒着狂风暴雨搬石头，运麻包，四十分钟便堵住了缺口。
      一九三一年水灾期间，伪汉口市长刘文岛等勾结大商家将粮食、布匹和许多生活必需品囤积起来，连治痢疾的特效药也搜罗一空，物价暴涨，大米每升由一角涨到二角二，而且拿着钱也很难买到。伪政府借此实行“裁、减、并”，革除了许多靠薪资过活的公教人员。留职人员的薪资也被他们七折八扣，并且拖欠了六个月没发。伪警备司令夏斗寅和参谋长叶蓬在“维持治安”的招牌下，见了船只就“拉差”，能出钱贿赂他们的还可以放走，出不起钱的便被他们拉去，再用高价租给大商家使唤。他们最后还向人民勒索了两万块银元的“划子巡查费”。
    在一九三一年里，人民受到天灾，又受到反动统治者重重盘剥和压榨，据伪政府记载，当时武汉急待赈济的灾民“已逾五十万人”。这些灾民都聚集在铁路埂上和黑山、洪山的荒地上，上面太阳晒，下面水气蒸。他们都是在仓惶中逃出一条性命来的，家里很少的一点衣物都被洪水冲光了，这时要吃没吃的，要喝没喝的，许多人就靠捞水草为食。许多孕妇都在荒地或破茅棚里生小孩，还被伪警察认为“有碍秩序”，四处逼赶。那时候，全市的粪便和脏水无处消纳，都倒在附近的水里，弄得蚊蝇群聚，臭气薰天；而灾民们还从这死水里打水喝。结果，霍乱、伤寒、痢疾等疫病蔓延，四处都看得见死人。在黑山、洪山等灾民区，饿死、病死的灾民都来不及掩埋，便挖几个千人坑，一层一层往里堆。据伪湖北水灾急赈委员会等从八月到次年四月的统计，他们掩埋的灾民便有三万二千六百零五人。实际死亡的人数比这还多得多。
    在一九五四年武汉防汛期间，国家进行了有计划的调拨，充分供应了武汉市粮、油、盐、煤、肉、布匹和日用百货。一度发生困难的菜蔬，也由全国各地支援。太原的包菜、江西的冬瓜、内蒙古和东北的马铃薯、四川的榨菜、江苏浙江的雪里红，另外还有许多豆制品和蛋品，源源不断地运来，每日上市的菜蔬跟平日相差不多。为了及时把这些生活品送到人民手里，和繁忙的防汛器材运输的同时，载重汽车川流不息地把大米和面粉运到全市一百八十个供应站上。米面加工厂的工人们，日夜碾制大米和面粉。在郊区渍水地带和堤防线上，三百多个国营商业和合作社的工作者，亲自挑着货郎担，推着手车和三轮车，驾着小船，把粮食、油盐和菜蔬送到流动供应站去。武汉物价始终稳定，人民生活一直正常。
    为了及时防预和消除因洪水而发生的疫病，人民政府进行了大规模的饮水消毒、污物处理、灭蝇灭蚊、预防注射等工作，同时组织了一千八百名医务人员（其中有三百四十一名医生）给防汛人员和受渍水淹的人家进行免费治疗。大多数医疗组不仅白天进行治疗，而且晚上也到工棚去，给工人盖被子，弄好蚊帐，同大家建立了亲密的友谊。医生高光述和闻亦齐还研究出医治因出汗过多而产生急性高烧病症的特效办法，在全市普遍推广。
    在武汉关附近的居巷（街名）住了三十多年的老太婆赵尖才，一九三一年带着五岁的女儿、三岁的儿子，逃到汉阳姥姥家去躲大水；结果姥姥家门前的堤防也冲破了，又逃到荒地里去住了两天两宿。而今年洪水期间，她的女儿和儿子、媳妇都在工厂里作工，每天照常上班，家里只留下她和她的老伴照顾四个孙儿女，生活很安定。丹水池附近的居民黄世庭，一九三一年发大水时全家被淹，只抢出了一顶破蚊帐；而今年他家还住在这个老地方，安然地欢度着中秋节。他家按照湖北民间的习惯，早上吃了汤元，中午喝了酒，晚上吃了月饼，一家老小过着幸福团圆的生活。
    少数渍水区和堤外被水淹的人家，都由人民政府逐一加以安置。生活困难的，也由政府加以救济；政府并帮助他们排除渍水，组织他们生产自救，重建家园。武汉市卫生局还在这些受灾的人家设立了三十八个分娩室，总共为祖国接待了五百九十七位新来的小公民。两次家里都被水淹的西马街居民邓凤英，回忆起一九三一年她在铁路边上破茅棚里生小孩的情形：几天没吃没喝，家里的人有一次抢到两个黑馍也掉到水里去了；……实在饿得不行。今年又遇上她媳妇生小孩，产前由协和医院用救护车接去，产后又是糖水，又是热面，……公家供应的东西吃喝不完。她激动地托人写了封信给她儿子，嘱咐他“好生守住堤防，保住武汉，感谢毛主席”。树人小学三年级学生左凤林小姑娘的家被淹了，人民政府把她家安置在市立第八女中，她仍然照常做她的暑期作业。在做“…不但…还…”的联句时，她写道：“人民政府这样好，不但帮助我们从水淹的地方搬出来，还照顾我们的生活，派医生给我们治病。”
