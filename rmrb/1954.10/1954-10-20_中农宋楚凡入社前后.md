The moon had already risen, but cooperative member Song Chufan was still carrying two large bundles of grass towards the threshing ground. He handed a few ears of grain to the person in charge of the threshing ground, and said with a smile: "This is the cooperative's property. If you're not careful with the small things, you won't even notice when the big things are lost!" After carrying the grass, he took the carrying pole back to the house, and then led the ox out. His wife, Li Xuemei, chased him to the door, calling him to wash and eat, but he said: "The moon waits for no one. I'll eat when I come back after plowing the field!" He drove the ox back to the field, where large chunks of mud turned over with his hand. The moon set, and the sky was especially dark. This field wasn't finished plowing yet, so he went back to the house and woke up his wife to hold the mirror lamp until it was finished. By then, it was already past 1:00 AM.

Everyone said that Old Song used to be "his person joined the cooperative, but his heart didn't," but now he has truly changed. This transformation is a long story.

In January of this year, the Songjiatan Agricultural Production Cooperative was going to expand, which was a big deal in Quanzhou (this area is alluvial soil along the river). Many people in the neighborhood applied to join the cooperative. Song Chufan's younger brother, Song Chuxiang, was young and enthusiastic, and his heart had long been attracted to the new things in the cooperative: he saw that last year, the agricultural cooperative planted 40 mu of double-cropping rice out of more than 70 mu of land, and the income of the cooperative members increased year by year; even young cooperative member Liao Xiguang, who had only studied for half a year, could explain so many principles.... As soon as he heard that the cooperative was going to expand, he wanted to apply to join, so he discussed it with his brother. Song Chufan firmly refused to join. Later, he even ignored his brother's questions. One evening, when the north wind was blowing and it was snowing heavily, the old Song family sat around the stove, talking warmly. Without knowing when, Chuxiang brought up the matter of joining the cooperative again. As soon as Song Chufan heard it, he flared up, threw his chair away, and shouted: "You keep yelling 'Join the cooperative! Join the cooperative!' Can't you live well with food in your stomach?"

Despite this, his brother kept persuading him to join the cooperative, saying how good it was, and Old Song was a little embarrassed. At night, he tossed and turned in bed, thinking: There are many poor peasants in the cooperative, and the foundation is weak. What benefits can I get from joining? I have no shortage of cattle and farm tools, and 20 mu of land for two people to work and four people to eat is enough to get by no matter what. Besides, I'm more free when I'm in charge, so why should I join the cooperative and be managed by others? It won't hurt to join in two years. Song Chufan thought about it over and over again, and always thought he was right, even arguing with his younger brother in his dreams!

Seeing that he couldn't persuade him, Chuxiang signed up to join the cooperative on his own; his father, out of love for his youngest son, also signed up. Chufan's wife saw that her father and younger brother had both joined the cooperative and came to persuade him to join as well, and Old Song was really worried: the family was living so peacefully, with enough to eat and wear, and now, because of joining the cooperative, everyone's hearts were scattered. Should he join the cooperative? Should he separate from the family? The knot just wouldn't untie. At this time, Wang Guohua, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, was afraid that there would be trouble in their family, so he personally went to his house, explained the policies and methods of the agricultural production cooperative, and also explained that joining the cooperative was voluntary and leaving was free. He couldn't resist the wishes of the three members of his family, so he reluctantly joined the cooperative.

After joining the cooperative, Old Song thought to himself: I have to leave a way out. When evaluating his property and investing in shares, he insisted on keeping that plot of land with good soil and a fertile foundation, the "brand name plot," as his private plot. He also kept a portion of the good fertilizer. He thought to himself: "I'll try it and see."

The spring plowing began. When Song Chufan started working, he was always lazy. When the cooperative assigned him to plow the fields, he always took a break after breakfast before going out. In the afternoon, he would stop working and go home when the sun was still more than ten feet high. After returning home, he would throw the plow in the yard and ignore it. Later, the cooperative chose him to watch the water. When the water flooded the ridges and submerged the seedling tips, he was nowhere to be seen. The cooperative held a meeting to criticize him, and he glared and said: "I can't stand this kind of treatment." From then on, he avoided the people from the cooperative from afar.

Several months passed, and a few things in the cooperative touched Old Song's heart.

It was a moonlit night in March, and the weather was unusually mild. Many people gathered in Song Chufan's yard, surrounding Old Song's yellow ox to evaluate its price. Everyone looked at its legs, pinched its horns, and discussed it among themselves. Song Chufan sat on the steps behind the crowd, not looking at the ox, not saying a word, but thinking to himself: Let's see if you're fair. If the price is too low, I won't join the cooperative. The director asked him: "Old Song, how much do you want for this ox?" Song Chufan said slowly: "You decide! I've already joined the cooperative, and I'm not relying on this ox!" The director said with a smile: "Then let's have a meeting of cooperative members to discuss it!"

Men and women, old and young, all arrived, bustling like a warm big family. Because people were sitting close together, the director's voice seemed even louder: "Song Chufan's ox is young and strong, and easy to use. Let's make a price!" The meeting, which had just quieted down, became lively again. Someone shouted in a high-pitched voice: "When livestock are invested in shares, it must be mutually beneficial. The cooperative can't suffer losses, and the owner of the ox can't suffer losses either." Everyone said a word, and I said a word, and they discussed it for an hour or two. Finally, the director summarized: "This ox was bought for 720,000 yuan, and at that time it was skin and bones. Now it's been fed so well that its buttocks are trimmed, so let's make it 920,000 yuan...." Everyone agreed, and decided to let the owner continue to feed it, with the cooperative supplying the feed and paying a daily wage of 800 yuan. Everyone also asked Old Song for his opinion. At this time, Old Song's face showed a smile that he had never had since joining the cooperative. He didn't say anything, but he was secretly happy: "The people in the cooperative are fair after all!"

Before transplanting rice seedlings, it rained continuously for more than ten days, and many people's seedlings were flooded to death. Old Song's beloved "brand name plot" was only half planted before he ran out of seedlings. Old Song was in trouble. He wanted to go to the cooperative to ask for some seedlings, but he remembered that when he joined the cooperative, everyone advised him to keep less private land, so how could he have the nerve to ask for seedlings now? If he didn't ask, there would be no way to plant that half-field. Finally, he bit the bullet and went to ask for seedlings, his face flushed. He turned back halfway. As he was hesitating, he saw Chuxiang carrying a load of seedlings, followed by several cooperative members. Before they could get close, Old Song quickly hid in his house. The sound of mountain songs outside reached his ears in waves. He couldn't bear it any longer, and went out to take a look. The cooperative members were busily transplanting seedlings in his "brand name plot." He silently followed behind and began to transplant seedlings as well.

After these few things, Song Chufan had a new view of the cooperative. But he was still a little worried. How much grain could he get?

The early rice was harvested. The cooperative had more people and more methods, and they overcame the flood, harvesting an average of 418 jin per mu, which was more than the mutual aid groups and individual households. During the pre-distribution, Old Song's family received 2,100 jin just from the early rice. Soon, the cooperative made a trial calculation and formulated an autumn harvest distribution plan. Although it suffered a flood this year, the total output still increased significantly compared to last year due to the large-scale planting of double-cropping rice and the expansion of late autumn crop area. It was estimated that the total amount of grain Old Song's family would receive would be more than 1,000 jin more than before joining the cooperative. During this time, when he passed by that big field that he had joined the cooperative with, he often thought: If it weren't for the agricultural cooperative, I wouldn't have been able to plant so much double-cropping rice! If it weren't for the agricultural cooperative, and the flood was so severe, how could I have had such a harvest? From then on, Song Chufan became enthusiastic about the affairs of the cooperative.

One night, it suddenly started raining heavily. It was pitch black, and you couldn't see your fingers. The road was slippery, and you had to take a step back for every step you took forward. At this time, there was a red light on the ridge of the field, rolling here and rolling there. It was Song Chufan watching the water. He carried a hoe on his back, carried a mirror lamp, dug open the moon mouth of this field, and then dug open another field. The water in the late rice field flowed out with a crash. When he finished everything and returned home, he was soaked all over, but he felt especially comfortable in his heart.

Recently, he also took the initiative to propose to the cooperative: "The cooperative is my home. Why should I keep any private land? Let me put those 2.5 mu of 'brand name plot' into the cooperative as well!"

The agricultural cooperative is attracting the vast number of peasants to take the road of collectivization. People are continuously visiting the Songjiatan Agricultural Production Cooperative. Once, several of Song Chufan's relatives also came to visit the cooperative. He led them around to visit with great enthusiasm, and when they came to his "iron tip field," facing the green late rice seedlings, he gesticulated and told a vivid story:

"In mid-July, it rained heavily for several days, and the river water rose sharply, overflowing the river embankment. The river embankment collapsed, and the flood poured into the rice fields, instantly turning them into a vast expanse of water. Later, it was finally hoped that the water would recede. This iron tip field was covered with a layer of sand and stones, two feet deep in some places and seven or eight inches shallow in others. It was really worrying! It looked like the early rice that was about to be harvested was buried in the sand. But the cooperative had more people and more strength. More than 20 laborers dug and carried! Even several teenagers organized groups, carrying bowls of sand to the outside of the river. The women, with scissors, cut off the ears of grain buried in the sand, one by one. The power was really great! In less than seven days, the sand pile slowly disappeared, and green seedlings were planted again. The women also cut 56 dou of grain in this field. If a single farmer suffered such a disaster, he could only cry; even a mutual aid group would have to wait until next year to transplant seedlings! If I hadn't joined the cooperative this year and encountered this disaster, my family's two laborers would have had to carry the sand and stones from more than five mu of land for half a year!"

This autumn, the Songjiatan Agricultural Production Cooperative is going to expand again. The people around, especially those with relatively wealthy families, often find Song Chufan to ask questions. Song Chufan has also become a person who loves to talk and laugh, and he is also very happy to tell others about his experiences and thoughts before and after joining the cooperative.

    中农宋楚凡入社前后
    繁勤　达才　和光
    月亮已经出来了，社员宋楚凡还担着两大捆草，向着晒谷场走去，他顺手交给晒谷员几根禾穗，笑眯眯地说：“这是社里的财产。不留心小的，大的丢了也看不见哩！”担完草，他把扁担送到屋里，牵着牛往外就走。他妻子李雪枚追到门口，喊他洗澡吃饭，他说：“月亮不等人，犁完田，回来吃吧！”他赶着牛又回到田里，大块大块的泥土，随着他的手翻转过来。月亮落了，天格外黑，这丘田还没犁完，他又到屋里喊醒妻子提着镜灯一直到犁完才回来。这时，已是午夜一点多了。
    大家都说老宋过去是“人入社，心没入社”，现在是真正转变了。这个转变，说来话长。
    今年元月间，宋家潭农业生产合作社要扩大，这在全洲（这一带是沿江的洲土）上可是件大事情。左邻右舍，不少人申请入社了。宋楚凡的弟弟宋楚湘，年轻、热情，他的心早被社的新事物吸引住了：他看见，去年农业社七十多亩田种上了四十亩双季稻，入了社的社员，年年收入增加；仅仅读了半年书的青年社员廖希光，便能讲出那么多道理来……。他一听说社要扩大就想申请入社，他就和他哥哥商量，宋楚凡坚决不入。后来，就连他弟弟的问话也不理了。在一个刮北风、下大雪的晚上，老宋一家人围着炉火温暖地谈天。不知什么时候，楚湘又谈到了入社的事，宋楚凡一听就冒了火，摔开椅子，大声叱着：“天天嚷着‘入社呀！入社呀！’肚里装着饭不好过吧！”
    尽管如此，弟弟还是不断地劝他入社，说社这样好那样好，老宋真有点为难了。夜里，他睡在床上翻来覆去地寻思：社里贫农多，底子薄，我入社有什么便宜占？自己耕牛、农具都不缺，二十亩田，两个人做，四个人吃，不管怎样也过得去。再说自己当家多自由，为什么要入社受人家管，等两年再入也不妨事。宋楚凡想来想去，一直认为自己想的对，在梦里还和老弟吵嘴哩！
    楚湘看劝不动他，独自报名入社了；父亲爱幼子心切，也跟着报了名。楚凡的妻子看见父亲弟弟都入了社也来劝他入社，老宋可真发了愁：一家子过得多太平，有吃有穿，现在为了入社，心都散啦。入社呢？分家呢？疙瘩老是解不开。这时，农业生产合作社社长王国华怕他们家里闹出事来，便亲自到他家里，讲清农业生产合作社的政策、办法，又说明入社自愿，退社自由。他拗不过一家三口人的主意，只好勉强入了社。
    入社了，老宋心里想：可得留个后路。他在评产入股时，坚持留下了那丘土壤好、底子肥的“牌子丘”，作为自留田。好的肥料也留下了一部分。他暗自思量：“试试看。”
    春耕开始了。宋楚凡干起活来，总是懒洋洋的。社里分配他去犁田，他吃了早饭，总要歇一会才出去。下午，太阳还有丈多高便收工回家。回来后，把犁向院子里一丢，就不管了。后来，社里选他看水，水漫过了田塍，淹没了秧尖，还看不到他的人影。社里开会批评他，他瞪着眼说：“我可受不了这份气。”从此，他老远见到社里的人便躲开了。
    几个月过去了，社里有几件事情打动了老宋的心。
    是一个有月亮的晚上，三月里的天气，异常温和。宋楚凡的院子里集合着许多人，围住了老宋的那头黄牛来评牛价，大家看看腿，捏捏角，你言我语地议论着。在人群背后的台阶上坐着宋楚凡，他也不看牛，也不说话，可是他心里却在想着：看看你们公道不公道，作价低了，我不入社。社长问他：“老宋，你这头牛要作多少钱？”宋楚凡慢吞吞地说：“你们看着作吧！人都入了社，还靠这头牛！”社长笑着说：“那我们开个社员大会商量吧！”
    男的女的，老的少的都到了，熙熙攘攘地像个温暖的大家庭。因为人坐得密，社长说话的声音更显得响亮：“宋楚凡的牛，又嫩又壮，又好使，大家作个价！”才静下去的会场又热闹起来了。不知谁尖着嗓子嚷着：“耕牛入股，可要互利呀，社不吃亏，牛主也不能吃亏。”你一句，我一句，讨论了个把钟头。最后，社长总结说：“这头牛是七十二万元买进来的，那时是皮包骨头，现在喂得屁股斩齐的，作九十二万元……。”大家同意了，并决定仍让牛主喂，饲料由社供给，每天八百元工资。大家又征求老宋的意见，这时老宋脸上泛起入社以来从未有过的微笑，嘴里没说什么，心里暗自欢喜：
  “社里的人到底公道！”
    插秧以前，连续落了十多天雨，许多人的秧苗被浸死了。老宋那块心爱的“牌子丘”，只插上一半便没秧了。老宋为了难，有心到社里去要些秧苗，他想起入社时，大家劝他少留自留田，现在怎么好意思去要苗；不要吧，那半丘田就没办法。最后他硬着头皮去要苗，脸上一阵热，走到半路又打了转。正在进退两难的时候，远远地看见楚湘担着一担秧走过来，后面跟着几个社员，不等他们走近，老宋赶忙躲在自己屋里。外面山歌的声音，阵阵传到耳里，他实在耐不下去了，走出门口一看，社员们正紧张地在他的“牌子丘”插秧，他也不声不响地随在后面插起秧来。
    从这几宗事以后，宋楚凡对社里有了新的看法。但他还有点不放心，究竟能分得多少谷呢？
    早稻收割了。社里人手多，办法多，战胜了水灾，每亩平均收了四百一十八斤，比互助组、单干户收的都多。预分时，光早稻，老宋家就分了二千一百斤。不久，社里试算和制订了秋收分配方案，虽然今年遭受水灾，因大量种植了双季稻，和晚秋作物面积的扩大，总产量仍较去年大为增加。预计老宋全家分得的粮食，将会比入社前增加一千多斤。这些时，他从自己入了社的那个大丘旁走过的时候，常想：不是农业社，可插不上这许多双季稻啊！不是农业社，水灾这样重，那能有这样的收成。从此以后，宋楚凡对社的事情便热心起来了。
    有一天的半夜里，突然落起大雨，天漆黑，伸手看不见五指，路滑，走一步要退半步。这时，田塍上有一盏红灯，一会滚到这里，一会又滚到那里。这是宋楚凡在看水。他背着锄头，提着镜灯，挖开了这丘田的月口，又挖开了另外的一丘，晚稻田里的水，哗哗地流了出来。当他把一切搞妥，回到屋里时，混身全都湿透了，他心里却特别舒坦。
    最近，他又主动地向社里提出来：“社就是我的家，还留什么自留田，让我把那二亩五分牌子丘，也入到社里吧！”
    农业社吸引着广大农民走合作化的道路，到宋家潭农业生产合作社参观的人陆续不断。有一次宋楚凡的几家亲戚也来社里参观。他兴致勃勃地领着他们到处参观，走到了他那块“铁尖丘”，面对着绿油油的晚稻禾，他指手划脚地讲出了一段生动的故事：
      “七月中旬，一连几天大雨，河水陡涨，漫过河堤，河堤垮了，大水向稻田里倾泻着，刹时一片汪洋。后来，好容易盼着水退了。这铁尖丘却盖上了一层沙石，深处有二尺，浅的也有七、八寸，真急人！眼看快要到口的早稻被压在沙堆里了。可是社里人手多，力量大，二十多个劳动力，挖呀！担呀！连几个十多岁的小孩也组织了小组，一碗碗地将沙子搬到河外去。妇女们带着剪子，把埋在沙堆里的穗头，一棵棵地剪下来。力量真大啦！不到七天，沙堆慢慢没有了，又插上了青绿的禾苗，妇女们还在这块田里剪了五石六斗谷。要是单干农民受了这样灾，只有哭脸；互助组也要明年才能插上秧！我今年要不入社，碰上这场灾，五亩多田的沙石，我家两个劳动力，可要担半年啦！”
    今秋，宋家潭农业生产合作社又要扩大了。周围的人们，特别是那些家底子比较富裕的人，常找宋楚凡问东问西。宋楚凡也变成个爱说爱笑的人了，他也很乐意把自己入社前后的经历和思想告诉别人。
