Short Commentary:

    The inspection report by the former Government Administration Council's People's Supervision Committee on the issue of over 4,000 tons of stockpiled steel analyzed the reasons for the steel backlog and recommended that all departments learn from this incident and conduct a review of the maintenance and handling of state materials. This is absolutely necessary.

    National materials are not only an important material foundation for realizing national construction plans, but also a fundamental guarantee for improving the material and cultural life of the broad masses of people. Therefore, rationally and thriftily using state materials and maximizing their effectiveness in the cause of national construction is a regular and important task for all national industrial departments and enterprises. In recent years, with the development of national construction, many units have made some improvements in handling stockpiled materials and material storage. However, the problems in this area are still very serious, the phenomenon of material backlog is still quite common, and cases of material damage due to poor storage are not isolated. According to statistics from some central departments, in 1953, stockpiled building materials in basic construction accounted for 30% of the annual material budget; the production reserves of many departments far exceeded normal reserve levels. This situation not only hinders the normal turnover of funds but also causes many materials to suffer serious losses due to poor storage. The reports from the supervisory offices of various departments to the former Government Administration Council's People's Supervision Committee also frequently reflected the situation of material backlogs and waste.

    Some people believe: "Under the current circumstances of frequent plan changes, lagging design, and insufficient warehouse facilities, the phenomenon of material backlog and loss is difficult to avoid." It should be admitted that these situations exist today and do create many difficulties for our work; however, this cannot be used as a reason to tolerate the phenomenon of material backlog and waste. In reality, the main reason why many units are causing the current material backlog and waste is that some staff members do not sufficiently understand the serious significance of cherishing state property and saving state materials. Some even adopt an indifferent and irresponsible attitude towards state materials. Some enterprise leaders only pursue product quantity or project progress and do not pay attention to the rational utilization and storage of materials and equipment; many staff members one-sidedly emphasize guaranteeing supply, neglect planned management, and blindly apply for the purchase of materials. When the materials stored by their units greatly exceed their needs, they neither actively adjust and dispose of them nor actively improve storage, leaving them exposed to the elements, corroding and deteriorating. For example, at the beginning of this year, the Dalian Chemical Plant had enough kraft paper in stock for packaging ammonium nitrate for one year, but blindly ordered kraft paper equivalent to about two and a half times the amount in stock, resulting in a serious backlog. Hundreds of pounds of grease at the Shanghai China Soap Company melted due to poor storage and flowed from the sewer into the Huangpu River. The value of seven items of materials, such as wood, stockpiled by the North China Directly Subordinate Third Construction Engineering Company reached 450 million yuan, most of which had been stockpiled for three years without being disposed of, and the loss due to material decay and deterioration caused by poor storage and other reasons has reached 190 million yuan. These are all intolerable phenomena.

    The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates that it is the duty of every citizen to cherish and protect public property. Leading cadres of all relevant departments must educate all employees to establish the concept of cherishing state property, improve material management, and overcome the phenomenon of backlog and waste. At present, the amount of stockpiled materials in various departments is still very large, and especially due to frequent rainfall in the second and third quarters of this year, the phenomenon of material damage due to poor storage is even more serious. All departments should immediately combine the work of material supply for next year, organize forces to clear inventory materials, and vigorously find ways to allocate and dispose of stockpiled materials. If the materials can be allocated and disposed of within the department or region, they should be resolved within the department or region immediately; if they cannot be resolved within the department or region, they should be reported to higher authorities for allocation and resolution. In the work of clearing inventory materials, it is also necessary to pay attention to preventing hasty disposal or causing other unwarranted losses. At the same time, we should also strengthen the storage of stored materials, prevent the corrosion, deterioration, and loss of state materials, and especially quickly find ways to rescue materials that are about to be damaged.

    People's supervisory organs at all levels should strengthen supervision and inspection of material technical supply work and resolutely fight against acts of not cherishing state materials.

### 克服积压和浪费国家物资的现象

    克服积压和浪费国家物资的现象
    前政务院人民监察委员会关于四千余吨钢材积压问题的检查报告，分析了四千余吨钢材积压的原因，并建议各部门从这个事件中接受教训，对国家物资的维护和处理工作进行一次检查。这是十分必要的。
    国家物资不仅是实现国家建设计划的重要物质基础，而且也是改善广大人民物质和文化生活的根本保证。因而合理地、节约地使用国家物资，使它在国家建设事业中发挥最大的效能，这是所有国家工业部门和企业单位的一项经常而重要的任务。几年来，随着国家建设事业的发展，有不少单位在处理积压物资和物资保管工作方面有了一些改善。但是，在这方面存在的问题仍然是很严重的，物资积压现象还相当普遍，物资因保管不善而受到损失的情况也不是个别的。根据中央一些部门的统计，一九五三年基本建设中积压的建筑材料占全年材料预算的百分之三十；不少部门的生产储备大大超过正常的储备量。这种情况不但妨碍了资金的正常周转，而且还使很多物资因保管不善而受到严重损失。在各部门监察室给前政务院人民监察委员会的报告中，也经常反映了物资积压和浪费的情况。
    有人认为：“在目前计划变动多、设计跟不上、仓库设备不足的情况下，物资积压而受到损失的现象是难于避免的。”应该承认，这些情况在今天是存在的，也确实使我们的工作增加了不少困难；但是决不能以此为理由，而容忍物资积压和浪费的现象。实际上，很多单位造成目前物资积压浪费现象的主要原因是：某些工作人员对爱护国家资财、节约国家物资的严重意义认识不足，有的甚至对国家物资采取了漠不关心和不负责任的态度。有些企业领导人员只追求产品数量或工程进度，不重视材料、设备的合理利用和保管；不少工作人员片面强调保证供应，忽视了计划管理，盲目地申请采购物资；当本单位贮备的物资大大地超过了需要的时候，他们既不积极调剂处理，又不积极改善保管，任凭风吹雨淋，腐蚀变质。如大连化学厂今年年初库存包装硝酸錏的牛皮纸已够一年使用，但又盲目订购了相当于库存约两倍半的牛皮纸，造成了严重的积压。上海中国肥皂公司几百斤油脂因保管不善而融化了，从阴沟流进了黄浦江。华北直属第三建筑工程公司积压的木材等七项材料价值就达四亿五千余万元，大部分是积压了三年没有处理，其中因保管不善等原因，而使材料腐损变质的损失已达一亿九千余万元。这些都是令人不能容忍的现象。
    中华人民共和国宪法规定，爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务。各有关部门的领导干部必须教育所有职工树立爱护国家资财的观念，改进物资管理工作，克服积压和浪费现象。目前各部门物资积压的数量仍然很多，特别由于今年二、三季度雨水频繁，物资因保管不善而受到损失的现象更为严重。各部门应即结合明年度的物资供应工作，组织力量清理库存物资，对积压的物资大力设法加以调拨处理。本部门、本地区能够调拨处理的，应即在本部门、本地区设法解决；在本部门、本地区内解决不了的，应即报请上级机关调拨解决。在清理库存物资的工作中，也必须注意防止草率处理或造成其他不应有的损失。同时，还应加强对所存物资的保管工作，防止国家物资的腐蚀变质和丢失现象，特别对即将受到损失的物资应该迅速设法抢救。
    各级人民监察机关应加强对物资技术供应工作的监督检查，坚决向不爱护国家物资的行为进行斗争。
