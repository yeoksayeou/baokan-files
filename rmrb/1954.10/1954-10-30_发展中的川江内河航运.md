Developing Inland Waterway Transportation on the Sichuan River
Wang Changjun

Sichuan is a province with many mountains and abundant water resources. It has the Yangtze River running through the entire province, as well as the four major inland river trunk lines of the Min River, Tuo River, Jialing River, and Wu River, and seventy-two tributaries such as the Qu River and Dadu River. The navigable mileage is more than 11,000 kilometers, passing through ninety-two counties and cities. Except for the Yangtze River, where transportation mainly relies on steamers, other rivers mainly rely on wooden sailboats. The province has more than 40,000 wooden sailboats, with a carrying capacity of more than 400,000 tons, which is a very important mass transportation force.

In recent years, in order to expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, the government has vigorously carried out rectification and reform work on the inland rivers of Sichuan: new routes have been opened and rectified, including the Lueyang River from Guangyuan to Lueyang in the upper reaches of the Jialing River, the Hou River from Wanyuan to Xuanhan, the Xiaojiang River from Wanxian to Kaixian, the Baitiao River from Chengdu to Guanxian, the Tongjiang River in the old revolutionary base area of northern Sichuan, and the Mabian River leading to minority areas; 385 dangerous shoals have been eliminated, and 565 kilometers of towpaths have been repaired.

The newly opened routes have played a significant role in developing industrial and agricultural production and supporting Sichuan's construction. More than 800 wooden sailboats of more than 10 tons often travel on the Lueyang River, supplying construction materials needed by four tunnel companies, five bridge construction offices, and other engineering sites of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. In the past, the iron produced by more than 40 small iron mines in Wanyuan relied entirely on manual labor, which was costly and slow. After the opening of the Hou River route from Wanyuan to Xuanhan, the freight rate was greatly reduced, and the transportation capacity increased threefold. The Tongjiang River in the old revolutionary base area, from Tongjiang to Pingchang, is 171 kilometers long. There are many shoals, shallow water, and rapid currents along the river. Some shoals are like pouring water from the roof. A three-ton boat can only carry one ton of cargo, and the cargo must be unloaded and the boat carried over the shoal, making transportation difficult and freight rates high. The grain produced by farmers became "dead corner grain," and local specialties were difficult to sell outside. Daily necessities, salt, and cloth were expensive due to transportation difficulties, with twelve catties of rice exchanged for one catty of salt. After the rectification of the Tongjiang River route, a four-ton boat can navigate from Pingchang to Tongjiang, taking only six to seven days for a round trip. The freight rate has been reduced by 75%, and four catties of rice can be exchanged for one catty of salt. The prices of other daily necessities have also been greatly reduced. The people of Tongjiang said, "Land reform and democratic reform have eliminated the feudal landlords and bullies on land and water. This year, the dangerous shoals on the water have been eliminated. These are all the benefits that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have given us!" The famous Wu River has rapid currents and many shoals, known as a natural barrier, with nine weirs, thirteen gorges, and the 60-kilometer-long Longmen Gorge. After vigorous rectification, dangerous shoals were blasted, channels were opened, and towpaths were repaired. Not only were wooden sailboats unimpeded, but steamers with a draft of three meters could also navigate year-round, implementing single-row towing, transporting grain and local specialties such as tung oil, lacquer, and ramie from more than ten counties along the river, such as Pengshui and Fuling, and ensuring the supply of salt and cotton cloth to more than a dozen counties along the river and the Tongren Prefecture of Guizhou, and the border counties of Hunan and Hubei. After the Jialing River, Fujiang River, Qu River, Jinsha River, and Mabian River leading to minority areas were rectified, the famous Mabian tea, with an annual output of more than 8,800 dan, was transported out in a timely manner, enabling the fraternal ethnic groups to receive nearly 3 billion yuan in revenue each year. After the opening of the steamer route from Chongqing to Nanchong, the resource-rich northern Sichuan area was closely linked with the industrially developed Chongqing.

The organization and management of inland river transportation have also been vigorously rectified, business management has been improved, transportation efficiency has been increased, and freight rates have been reduced. The freight rate in 1952 was 8.45% lower than in 1951, and in 1953 it was 6% lower than in 1952 on average. This year, it is 22.47% lower than in 1953 on average. Due to the reduction of freight rates and the improvement of production, the sources of goods have also continued to increase, and the transportation turnover has also increased significantly. Taking the cargo volume in 1952 as 100, it was 130 in 1953, and the first and second quarters of 1954 increased by 110% compared with the same period in 1953. With the increase in the source of goods and the improvement of ship turnover, the income of boatmen and boat people has also been constantly increasing. In terms of the welfare of boatmen and boat people, four boatmen dormitories were built in 1953 in the four major wharves of Chongqing, Hechuan, Fuling, and Luzhou, which can accommodate 2,660 people. In medium-sized wharves, the local government also allocated some houses as simple dormitories. Rest sheds and tea stations are set up at large and medium-sized wharves; some also have dining rooms and reading rooms. Thirty-three boatmen clinics have been opened. When traveling in groups, a hygiene kit is carried with the boat. In addition, two floating primary schools and dozens of literacy classes and night schools for boatmen have been opened, and the cultural level of boatmen and boat people has gradually improved. The transportation department also pays attention to improving the skills of boatmen. At present, more than a dozen wooden boat captains have been trained as river pilots on steamers, and more than 200 boatmen have been promoted to sailors on single-row towed barges.

    发展中的川江内河航运
    王长军
    四川是一个多山多水的省份，有贯穿全省的长江，有岷江、沱江、嘉陵江、乌江四大内河干线，有渠江、大渡河等七十二条支流，通航里程一万一千多公里，流经九十二个县、市，除长江运输主要依靠轮船外，其他河流主要依靠木帆船。全省有木帆船四万多只，载重量四十多万吨，是一支极重要的群众性的运输大军。
    几年来，政府为了扩大城乡物资交流，适应工农业生产和人民生活的需要，对川江内河大力进行了整治改革工作：开辟和整治了嘉陵江上游广元至略阳的略阳河、万源至宣汉的后河、万县通往开县的小江、成都到灌县的柏条河、川北革命老根据地的通江河及通往少数民族地区的马边河等新的航线；消灭了三百八十五个险滩，整修了纤道五百六十五公里。
    新开辟的航线对发展工农业生产和支援四川的建设事业，都起了很大的作用。略阳河上经常行驶着八百多只十吨以上的木帆船，供应宝成铁路四个隧道公司、五个桥公所和其他工程所需要的建筑器材。过去万源四十多家小铁矿生产的铁全靠人力背，成本高，运得又慢，万源至宣汉的后河航线开辟后，运价大为降低，运输力提高三倍。革命老根据地的通江河，自通江至平昌长一百七十一公里，沿线滩多、水浅、水流湍急，有的滩如同从屋顶上往下倒水一样，三吨船只能载一吨货，过滩还要把货搬下，把船抬过去，运输困难，运价高，农民生产的粮食成为“死角粮”，土特产难以外销，所需的日用品、食盐、布匹等因运输困难，价格昂贵，十二斤大米才换一斤食盐。通江河航线整治后，平昌到通江可以航行四吨的载船，往返一次，只用六天至七天的时间，运价降低了百分之七十五，四斤大米可换回一斤食盐，其他日用品的价格也大有降低。通江人民说：“土地改革、民主改革肃清了陆上水上的封建地主恶霸，今年又消灭了水上滩险，这都是共产党毛主席给我们的好处啊！”著名的乌江水急滩多，号称天险，有九堰十三峡和长达六十公里的龙门峡，经过大力整修后，炸掉了险滩，开辟了槽口，整修了纤道，不仅使木帆船畅通无阻，并可常年航行吃水三公尺的轮船，实行一列式拖带，把沿江两岸彭水、涪陵等十多县的粮食和土产特产如桐油、漆、麻等运出，并保证了沿江两岸十几个县和贵州铜仁专区、湖南、湖北边沿县食盐、花纱布的供应。嘉陵江、涪江、渠江、金沙江和通往少数民族地区的马边河经过整修后，把年产八千八百余担著名的马边茶及时运出，使兄弟民族每年得到将近三十亿元的收益。重庆到南充的轮船航线开辟后，把物产丰富的川北地区与工业发达的重庆紧密地联系起来了。
    内河运输的组织管理工作也进行了大力整顿，改进了业务管理，提高了运输效率，降低了运价。一九五二年运价比一九五一年降低了百分之八点四五，一九五三年又比一九五二年平均降低了百分之六，今年又比一九五三年平均降低百分之二十二点四七。由于运价的降低，生产的改进，货源也不断增多，运输周转量也有显著的提高。以一九五二年货运量为一百，一九五三年即为一百三十，一九五四年的一、二季度又比一九五三年同期增加百分之
  一百一十，随着货源增加，船舶运转率提高，船工船民的收入也相对的不断增长。在船工船民的福利方面，一九五三年在重庆、合川、涪陵、泸州四个大码头盖了四幢船工宿舍，可容纳二千六百六十人。在中等的码头上也由当地政府拨给一些房子作简单宿舍。在大、中码头上，都设有休息棚、茶水站；有的还有饭厅、图书阅览室。开辟了三十三处船工医疗所。集体航行时，随船带有卫生包。此外，还开办了两处水上小学和几十个船工识字班及夜校，船工船民也逐步提高了文化水平。运输部门还注意提高船工技术，目前已有十多个木船船长被培养成轮船上的领江，二百多个船工提拔为一列式拖驳上的水手。
