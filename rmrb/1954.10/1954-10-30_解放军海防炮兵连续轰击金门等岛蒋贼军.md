Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, October 29th: The People's Liberation Army's coastal artillery on the Fujian Front has continuously bombarded Chiang Kai-shek's troops on Kinmen, Dadan, and other islands. From September 26th to October 22nd, they shelled Chiang Kai-shek's military positions on Dadan Island, Erdan Island, and Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands a total of 23 times, destroying four warehouses at the Shuitou Wharf of Chiang Kai-shek's forces, killing and wounding some of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The attacks have already forced Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the islands to avoid easily operating in front of their positions.

On the morning of October 5th, nearly one hundred soldiers and nine vehicles of Chiang Kai-shek's army secretly gathered at the Shuitou Wharf on Greater Kinmen and Height 114 on Lesser Kinmen Island to move supplies. Our People's Liberation Army artillery immediately opened fire, hitting four warehouses of Chiang Kai-shek's army at the Shuitou Wharf, which burst into flames. The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and vehicles that were moving supplies were bombarded by our artillery shells and fled in a panic from the smoke. Chiang Kai-shek's troops entrenched on Dadan Island, Erdan Island, and Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands have several times dispatched troops in batches, attempting to conduct military exercises and reinforce fortifications, but each time they have been subjected to fierce bombardment by our army's artillery fire.

During this period, the Chiang Kai-shek army artillery entrenched on Kinmen Island fired more than 400 shells at our Xiamen Island and Greater Deng Island and Lesser Deng Island a total of thirteen times. Chiang Kai-shek's troops were met with fierce counterattacks from our People's Liberation Army artillery every time they shelled.

    解放军海防炮兵连续轰击金门等岛蒋贼军
    【新华社福建前线二十九日电】福建前线中国人民解放军海防炮兵连续炮击金门、大担等岛上的蒋贼军。自九月二十六日到十月二十二日，先后共炮击大担岛、二担岛和大、小金门岛上的蒋贼军阵地二十三次，击毁蒋贼军水头码头仓库四座，打死打伤蒋贼军一部，已迫使岛上蒋贼军不敢轻易地在阵地前沿活动。
    十月五日上午，有近百名蒋贼军士兵和九辆汽车偷偷地集合到大金门的水头码头和小金门岛一一四高地搬运物资，我人民解放军炮兵立即开炮轰击，水头码头上的四座蒋贼军仓库被打中燃起大火。正在搬运物资的蒋贼军士兵和汽车受到我军炮弹的轰击后，从硝烟中狼狈四散逃跑。盘踞大担岛、二担岛和大、小金门岛上的蒋贼军，曾几次分批出动，企图进行军事演习和加修工事，但每次都遭受到我军炮火的猛烈轰击。
    在这一时期中，盘踞金门岛上的蒋贼军炮兵曾先后向我厦门岛和大登岛、小登岛等岛上打炮十三次，发射炮弹四百多发。蒋贼军在每次炮击时，都受到我人民解放军炮火的猛烈还击。
