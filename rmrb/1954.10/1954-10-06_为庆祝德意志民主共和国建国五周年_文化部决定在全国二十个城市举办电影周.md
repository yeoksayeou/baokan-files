Xinhua News Agency, 5th. To celebrate the 5th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic and to further strengthen the profound friendship and cultural exchange between China and the German Democratic Republic, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China has decided to hold a "German Democratic Republic Film Week" throughout the country.

The Film Week will begin on October 7th, the National Day of the German Democratic Republic, and will be held successively in twenty cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Lushun-Dalian, Anshan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jinan, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanning, Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, Xi'an, and Lanzhou. At that time, six films produced by the DEFA film studio of the German Democratic Republic will be screened.

These include: "The Invincible People," a film based on the history of the German workers' movement. The film illustrates the truth that the working class is invincible.

"Secret Files," a film based on a real case from 1950 in which the German Democratic Republic cracked a spy organization that had infiltrated a sodium carbonate factory to sabotage production. The film narrates the entire process of this crime, praising the heroic qualities of the working class of Democratic Germany and exposing the crimes of imperialism in plotting to undermine the economic construction of Democratic Germany.

"A Young Couple," which tells the story of a young actor and actress who, in real life and artistic practice, correctly understand reality and choose the path of serving the cause of peace through art. The film illustrates that art cannot but serve politics, and that true love is also built on a common ideological foundation.

"Men and Women Advance Side by Side," which depicts the production competition that took place in metallurgical and steel plants throughout Democratic Germany at the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan. The film demonstrates the excellent qualities of the working class of Democratic Germany in loving their country, loving labor, and loving their work.

"Soviet Puppet Show," which introduces several wonderful programs performed in Democratic Germany by Soviet puppet artists led by Obraztsov, including a satirical drama "Bewitched by Your Eyes" exposing the dark secrets of Hollywood film companies. "The Magic Lamp," which will be screened at the same time, is also a puppet show adapted from an Arabian fairy tale by the Soviet State Puppet Theatre. These two films demonstrate the outstanding achievements of Soviet puppetry.

"Blue Flags Flutter in the Summer Breeze" records the happy and joyful lives of young pioneers in Democratic Germany during their summer vacations. The film illustrates the concern of the party and government of Democratic Germany for the health and intellectual development of children.

    【新华社五日讯】为庆祝德意志民主共和国建国五周年，进一步加强中国和德意志民主共和国间的深厚友谊和文化交流，中华人民共和国文化部决定在全国各地举办“德意志民主共和国电影周”。
    电影周将从十月七日德意志民主共和国国庆这天起，先后在北京、天津、太原、沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、旅大、鞍山、上海、南京、杭州、济南、武汉、广州、南宁、重庆、昆明、成都、西安、兰州等二十个城市举行。届时将放映德意志民主共和国德发电影制片厂摄制的六部影片。
    其中包括：“不可战胜的人们”，这是一部取材自德国工人运动历史的影片。影片说明了这样一个真理：工人阶级是不可战胜的。

      “一对青年夫妇”，这是写一对青年演员在现实生活与艺术实践中，正确的认识了现实，选择了艺术为和平事业服务的道路。影片说明：艺术不能不为政治服务；真正的爱情，也是建筑在共同的思想基础上。
    “男女并肩前进”，这是写民主德国在第一个五年计划开始的时期，全国冶金、炼钢工厂展开了生产竞赛。影片表现了民主德国的工人阶级热爱祖国、热爱劳动和热爱自己工作的优秀品质。
