Dear friends,

Today we are about to leave your beautiful and hospitable country. Participating in the celebrations for the fifth anniversary of the People's Republic of China has left us with a deep impression. We will never forget how resolutely the great Chinese people support their government and the government's policy of freedom, independence, peace, and friendship with the people of all countries. We saw this very clearly during the October 1st celebrations.

The Chinese people's love and respect for their great leader Mao Zedong demonstrate their determination to continue advancing on the path of happiness and prosperity indicated by the Chinese Communist Party.

The October 1st parade demonstrated that the Chinese people have the strength and ability to defend the sovereignty of their young People's Republic and resist all attacks on the unity, independence, and territorial integrity of their motherland.

The unbreakable friendship between the German people and the great Chinese people, and the shining example of the Chinese people's struggle and victory, inspire the German people to carry out the struggle for the peaceful and democratic reunification of their motherland. Our two peoples and governments share a common desire to contribute to the collective guarantee of peace in Europe and Asia.

As we bid farewell to the government and people of the People's Republic of China, we sincerely thank them for their hospitality.

Long live the Chinese people and their great leader Mao Zedong!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the German and Chinese people!

Long live the common great friend of the Chinese and German people, the strong fortress of world peace - the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    博尔茨团长在机场上的讲话亲爱的朋友们：
    今天我们就要离开你们的美好和好客的国家。这次参加中华人民共和国五周年国庆典礼给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们永远不会忘记，伟大的中国人民是如何坚决地拥护自己的政府，拥护政府所奉行的自由、独立、和平以及与各国人民友好的政策。这一点我们在十月一日观礼的时候，看得非常清楚。
    中国人民对伟大的领袖毛泽东的热爱和尊敬，表现了他们在中国共产党所指出的、幸福和繁荣的道路上继续前进的决心。
    十月一日的检阅，表现了中国人民有力量而且有能力保卫自己年轻人民共和国的主权，抵抗对他们祖国统一、独立和领土完整的一切进攻。
    德国人民和伟大的中国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，以及中国人民的斗争和胜利的光辉榜样，鼓舞着德国人民进行恢复祖国和平与民主的统一的斗争。我们两国人民和政府有着为集体保障欧洲和亚洲和平而作出贡献的共同愿望。
    在我们向中华人民共和国政府和人民告别的时候，我们衷心地感谢他们的盛情款待。
    中国人民及其伟大的领袖毛泽东万岁！
    德国人民和中国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国人民和德国人民共同的伟大朋友、全世界和平的坚强堡垒——苏联万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
