Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 21st: According to TASS, on the afternoon of October 19th, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting to discuss the inclusion of the following proposals on the agenda of the General Assembly: the Czechoslovak delegation's proposal on "Prohibition of Propaganda for a New War" and the Soviet delegation's proposals on "Acts of Aggression Against the People's Republic of China and the Responsibility of the US Navy for These Acts" and "Violation of Freedom of Navigation in the China Seas."

The Czechoslovak representative, I. Nosek, spoke about the need to stop propaganda for a new war. He pointed out that the adoption of a proposal on this issue by the United Nations General Assembly would further ease the international tensions that had already eased somewhat. He suggested that the Political Committee discuss this issue.

US Representative Lodge did not object to including this issue on the agenda of the General Assembly, but he made a statement that was at least very strange, saying that discussing the prohibition of propaganda for a new war would not help consolidate peace. Colombian representative Urrutia also expressed the same unfounded opinion. Soviet representative Vyshinsky supported the Czechoslovak delegation's proposal.

The General Committee passed a resolution to include this issue on the agenda of the General Assembly. The only person to oppose this suggestion was the Kuomintang element during the vote. The General Committee decided that the Special Political Committee would review this issue.

Next, the General Committee discussed the inclusion of the proposal on "Acts of Aggression Against the People's Republic of China and the Responsibility of the US Navy for These Acts" on the agenda of the General Assembly.

British representative Lloyd did not fundamentally object to including this issue on the agenda, but he proposed that the General Committee review this issue two weeks later. The representatives of France, Iceland, and Burma supported his proposal.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky pointed out in his speech that the sole purpose of the Soviet delegation in submitting this issue for discussion was to end the situation in the Taiwan and China Sea area that threatened peace. Vyshinsky said that the actions directly carried out by the United States or under its direction have turned the Taiwan and China Sea area into a hotbed of war in the Far East, which may cause serious consequences and naturally cannot but cause great anxiety to everyone. It is equally undeniable that the US aggressive bloc should bear direct responsibility for the formation of this situation. We believe that this situation requires the attention of the General Assembly, so we suggest including this issue as a new important item on the agenda.

The representatives of Western countries believed that discussing this issue might exacerbate international tensions. Vyshinsky emphasized that it was the act of aggression itself that exacerbated international tensions, not the discussion of the act of aggression. On the contrary, the purpose of such a discussion is to eliminate such actions.

US Representative Lodge, who spoke next, attempted to slander the Soviet Union, insisting that it wanted to use the discussion of the Taiwan issue to wage "cold war" against the United States.

The General Committee passed the motion to postpone the discussion on including the motion "Acts of Aggression Against the People's Republic of China and the Responsibility of the US Navy for These Acts" on the agenda of the General Assembly by twelve votes to two (the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia).

In this way, the US representative and those delegations that supported his position dared not directly oppose the discussion of this issue, but achieved the goal of temporarily postponing the discussion of this issue.

Then, the General Committee began to review the Soviet proposal to include the proposal on "Violation of Freedom of Navigation in the China Seas" on the agenda. The Kuomintang element, with the support of US representative Lodge, moved to postpone the review of this issue indefinitely.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky proposed that there should be no further delay in including this proposal on the agenda of the General Assembly. He reminded the committee that this issue was being reviewed for the second time. During the first review, the General Assembly decided to delay the inclusion of this proposal on the agenda for a few days. About two weeks have passed since the General Assembly adopted this decision, and the General Committee should implement the decision of the General Assembly. The Soviet representative reminded the committee that the French government had mediated at the request of the Soviet government to help resolve the issue of the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" and its crew, but this mediation could not solve the entire problem of violating freedom of navigation in the China Seas. The General Assembly should take measures to end the piratical acts of the Kuomintang elements that threaten navigation in this area. The Soviet representative cited new facts proving that the Kuomintang elements are continuing such piratical acts, and this time they intercepted the British ship "Jida" bound for Shanghai. Vyshinsky said, we believe that it is time to include this proposal on the agenda of the General Assembly.

After a brief debate, the General Committee passed the French representative's amendment to the Kuomintang element's proposal by a majority vote. The French representative's amendment advocated postponing the decision on including this proposal on the agenda for another two weeks.

    关于把苏联提出的美国侵略我国提案列入联大议程的问题
    联大总务委员会竟无理决定延期两周讨论
   【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十日讯：十月十九日下午，联合国大会总务委员会举行会议，讨论关于把下列议案列入大会议程的问题，这些问题就是：捷克斯洛伐克代表团提出的“禁止新的战争的宣传”和苏联代表团提出的“侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”和“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表伊·诺西克谈到必须制止新的战争的宣传。他指出，联合国大会通过关于这一问题的提案，就可以使已经有了一些缓和的国际紧张局势获得进一步的缓和。他建议政治委员会讨论这一问题。
    美国代表洛奇对把这一问题列入大会议程没有异议，但他发表一种至少可以说是很奇怪的说法，据他说讨论禁止新的战争的宣传问题无助于巩固和平。哥伦比亚代表乌鲁蒂亚也发表了同样的毫无根据的意见。苏联代表维辛斯基支持捷克斯洛伐克代表团的建议。
    总务委员会通过决议把这一问题列入大会议程。表决的时候反对这一建议的只有国民党分子。总务委员会并决定由特别政治委员会来审查这一问题。
    接着总务委员会讨论把“侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”的提案列入大会议程的问题。
    英国代表劳埃德并不在实质上反对把这一问题列入议程，但是他提议总务委员会在两个星期以后再审查这一问题。法国、冰岛和缅甸的代表都支持他的建议。
    苏联代表维辛斯基在发言中指出，苏联代表团把这一问题提出讨论的唯一目的就是要结束在台湾和中国海区域内造成的威胁和平的局面。维辛斯基说，美国所直接进行的或者在它指使下进行的行为把台湾和中国海区域变成了远东的战争温床，这可能引起种种严重后果，自然不能不引起大家很大的不安。同样不能否认，美国侵略集团应当对这种局势的形成负直接责任。我们认为，这种局势需要大会加以注意，因此我们建议把这个问题作为新的重要项目列入议程。
    西方国家的代表认为，讨论这个问题可能加剧国际紧张局势，维辛斯基对这点着重指出：加剧国际紧张局势的是侵略行动本身，而不是对侵略行动的讨论。而且相反，这种讨论的目的就是要消除这类行动。
    接着发言的美国代表洛奇企图诬蔑苏联，硬说它想利用台湾问题的讨论来对美国进行“冷战”。
    总务委员会以十二票对两票（苏联和捷克斯洛伐克）通过了延期两星期再讨论关于把“侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”这个议案列入大会议程的建议。
    美国代表和支持他的立场的那些代表团就是这样不敢直接反对讨论这个问题，而达到了使这个问题的讨论暂时延期的目的。
    然后，总务委员会开始审查苏联的关于把“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”这个议案列入议程的建议，国民党分子在美国代表洛奇的支持下动议无限期延期审查这一问题。
    苏联代表维辛斯基提议不再拖延把这个议案列入大会议程。他提醒委员会说，这个问题已经是第二次审查了，在第一次审查的时候，大会决定延迟几天再把这个议案列入议程。自从大会通过这个决定后已经过了约两个星期，总务委员会应当执行大会的决定了。苏联代表提醒委员会说，法国政府根据苏联政府的请求进行斡旋，帮助解决苏联油船“图阿普斯号”以及它的船员的问题，但是这种斡旋并不能解决侵犯在中国海面的航行自由的整个问题，大会应当采取措施来结束使这个区域的航行受到威胁的国民党分子的海盗行为。苏联代表举出了新的事实，证明国民党分子在继续进行这种海盗行为，他们这一次拦截了驶往上海的英国船只“吉达号”。维辛斯基说，我们认为，已经是把这个议案列入大会议程的时候了。
    经过了为时不久的辩论后，总务委员会以多数票通过了法国代表对国民党分子的建议的修正案。法国代表的修正案主张再延期两星期决定关于把这个议案列入议程的问题。
