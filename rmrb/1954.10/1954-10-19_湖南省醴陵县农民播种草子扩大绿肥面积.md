Farmers in Liling County, Hunan Province, a high-yield rice area, are actively sowing grass seeds to expand the green manure area. Many farmers in Liling have the habit of planting grass seeds. According to their experience, 1,000 kilograms of grass seeds are equivalent to ten loads of manure or more than 100 kilograms of vegetable cakes in terms of fertilizer effect, which has a great effect on rice field yield. In order to expand the planting area of grass seeds, as early as the beginning of September, the County Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy printed small booklets on the cultivation methods and management techniques of "red clover seeds" and distributed them to various districts and townships. Agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups in various districts successively held forums for experienced farmers to study the cultivation and management techniques of red clover seeds in light of local conditions. Some farmers in areas without the habit of planting grass seeds had concerns, so district and township cadres publicized the benefits of planting more grass seeds. Shi Jiquan, the leader of a mutual aid group in the Sixth District, used his own experience of increased production to mobilize the group members. As a result, the entire group increased planting from the original plan of three mu to more than nine mu of grass seeds. Most of the rice fields in Liling County are planted with double-cropping rice. Now that the late rice has not yet matured, the farmers have adopted the method of mixed planting of late rice and grass seeds. Driven by cooperatives and mutual aid groups, the area planted with grass seeds in various districts has greatly increased compared with last year. For example, Xiangtang Township in the Sixth District planted more than 400 mu last year, and this year it has planted 1,200 mu. Up to now, the county has planted more than 430,000 mu of grass seeds, accounting for more than 60 percent of the county's cultivated land area.

    湖南省醴陵县农民播种草子扩大绿肥面积
    湖南省水稻高产量区的醴陵县农民正积极赶种草子，扩大绿肥面积。醴陵的许多农民有种草子的习惯，根据他们的经验：一千斤草子抵得上十担大粪或百多斤菜饼的肥效，对稻田丰产的作用很大。为了扩大草子种植面积，早在九月上旬，县农林水利局就印出了“红花草子”的栽培方法和管理技术等小册子分发到各区、乡，各区的农业社、互助组都先后召开了老农座谈会，结合本地情况，研究学习了红花草子的栽培管理技术。部分地区没有种草子习惯的农民有顾虑，区、乡干部就宣传多种草子的好处。六区史纪权互助组组长以自己得到增产的事迹动员组员，于是，全组由原计划种三亩增种到九亩多草子。醴陵县的大部分稻田种的是双季稻，现在晚稻还未成熟，农民们就采用了晚稻、草子混种的办法。在合作社、互助组带动下，各区种植草子的面积较去年大为增加。如六区乡塘乡去年种四百多亩，今年已种一千二百亩。到现在为止，全县已种草子四十三万多亩，达全县耕地面积百分之六十以上。　（本报湖南记者站）
