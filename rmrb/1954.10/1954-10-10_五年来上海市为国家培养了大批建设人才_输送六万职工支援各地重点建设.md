In the construction sites of the motherland's key projects and in the newly built factories, workers from Shanghai are working diligently everywhere. In the past five years, Shanghai has transferred more than 63,000 employees to support national construction, including not only workers, but also factory directors, engineers, experts, and technicians. In last year alone, Shanghai sent more than 20,000 workers, 1,000 engineering and technical personnel, and more than 3,200 management and political work cadres to various places to participate in construction. Not long ago, workers from the remote Northeast of the motherland, from Shanxi, from Hebei, sent letters from their respective construction sites to Shanghai, reporting on their production achievements. Chen Yongde and Ying Wenhua, two comrades who participated in industrial construction in a certain place in Northeast China, wrote in their letter: "Half a year ago, we had just arrived here from Shanghai. At that time, we lived in mud houses and used candles for lighting. Now, on the vast grassland of Fularji, new workers' residences and tall factory buildings have been built, with electric lights, running water, and warm heating. These were all built by the hands of our worker brothers, and Shanghai workers have also contributed to them." Shen Peizhong, a construction worker who participated in the construction of the Shanxi Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, wrote in his letter: "When I first arrived at the construction site, I saw pits everywhere. Not only were there no foundry tools, but we didn't even know where to find sand. After everyone used their brains and came up with solutions, we cast beautiful tools. In just three years, we built a large factory on the flat ground." Four workers who went with him were ordinary workers at the time, but now, under the training and education of the Party and the trade union, one has become a workshop director, two have become work section leaders, and he himself has become the chairman of the workshop trade union. Three of the four have honorably joined the Communist Party of China. He wrote in his letter: "The motherland is advancing, and we are also progressing!"

Shanghai not only sends a large number of technical talents to support key construction projects in various places, but also cultivates batches of new technical talents for the country. The various technical training courses held in Shanghai, from the first half of 1951 to the end of May this year, have already trained more than 34,000 ordinary workers to become fitters, planers, milling machine operators, welders, and other skilled workers. Shanghai factories also frequently undertake the task of training workers on behalf of newly built factories in various places.

    五年来上海市为国家培养了大批建设人才
    输送六万职工支援各地重点建设
    在祖国重点建设的工地上和新建成的工厂中，到处都有从上海去的工人辛勤地劳动着。五年来，上海输送了六万三千多名职工去支援国家建设，这里面除了工人外，还有厂长、工程师、专家和技术人员等。仅去年一年中，上海就有两万多工人、一千个工程技术人员、三千二百多个管理干部和政治工作干部到各地去参加建设。不久前，工人们从祖国遥远的东北、从山西、从河北，从他们所在的各个工地上寄信到上海，报告了他们生产上的成绩。参加东北某地工业建设的上海工人陈咏德、应文华两同志的信上说：“半年前，我们刚从上海来到这里，那时住的是土房子，用腊烛点灯，如今在这富拉尔基的大草原上，建造起了新的工人住宅、高大的厂房，里面有电灯、自来水和那热烘烘的暖气，这都是我们工人兄弟双手造起来的，这里面也有我们上海工人的一分力量哩。”参加山西省经纬纺织机械厂的建厂工人沈培忠的信上说：“刚到工地一看，东一个坑，西一个坑，不但没有翻砂工具，就连砂子也不知道去哪里找。经过大家动脑筋，想办法，铸出了漂亮的工具，不过三年光景，我们就在平地上建造起了一座大工厂。”和他一同去的四个工人，当时还是普通工，如今在党和工会的培养教育下，一个当了车间主任，两个当了工段长，他自己也做了车间工会主席，四个人中，已有三个光荣地参加了中国共产党。他信上说：“祖国在前进，我们也进步啦！”
    上海不但派大量的技术人材支援各地的重点建设，同时还替国家培养了一批批新的技术人材。上海举办的各种技术训练班，从一九五一年上半年开始到今年五月底，已经把三万四千多个普通工人培养成为钳工、刨工、铣工、电焊工和其他技术工人。上海的工厂还经常接受各地新建工厂委托的代训工人的任务。
