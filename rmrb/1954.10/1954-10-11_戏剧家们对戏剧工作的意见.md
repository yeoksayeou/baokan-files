Playwrights' Opinions on Drama Work
By our reporter Zi Gang

Before the opening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, our reporter interviewed some playwright representatives: Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Mei Lanfang, Hong Shen, Cao Yu, Ma Yanxiang, Cheng Yanqiu, Zhou Xinfang, Huang Zuolin, Zhao Dan, Yuan Xuefen, and Chang Xiangyu. They expressed their opinions on the achievements of the past five years in drama work and several major current issues.

    Develop Creation, Enrich Repertoire
The representatives all attached great importance to the issue of script creation. There have been considerable gains in this area. In terms of drama creation, there have appeared plays such as "Dragon Beard Ditch," "In Front of New Things," "Forty Years of Aspirations," "The Battlefront Shifts South," "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," "Gate No. 6," "Spring Blossoms and Autumn Fruits," and "Women Representatives," which are relatively popular with the masses. In the past five years, we have also reorganized some traditional repertoires of various opera genres, retaining their popular artistic essence and removing the feudal dross mixed within them. After the First National Opera Performance and Observation Conference, the drama community more generally recognized the richness of the opera heritage and the realistic traditions contained in many traditional repertoires.

The achievements in script creation show that playwrights have made progress in learning and immersing themselves in life. As Ouyang Yuqian pointed out, "In the past five years, both new and old drama playwrights have worked hard to learn and have a deeper and broader understanding of the new life of the people. Some playwrights have shifted from slogans to depicting the reality of life; some playwrights have paid attention to choosing forms and using techniques for content, and they have gradually planned to study history and classical works from China and abroad. All of this will improve the quality of the works." In order to write "Bright Sky," Cao Yu repeatedly went to the hospital to experience life. He said: "A good painter must be good at depicting characters and things from all angles. Knowing only one side is not enough. The same is true for writing scripts. The writer has a responsibility to see things more deeply, more comprehensively, more concisely, and more sharply. Therefore, in addition to trying to understand people's lives and inner activities as much as possible, we also need to have independent thinking ability to truly apply Marxism-Leninism to creation. I understand this principle, but I can't do it yet, so this play is not well written. I am continuing to revise it now." Cao Yu repeatedly mentioned that in his creative process, he personally experienced the Party's infinite concern for literary and art work. The doors of any place were open to him, giving him ample opportunity to contact various characters and ideas. When he encountered difficulties in his creation, it was always the Party's strong hand that supported him, allowing him to finish writing this play.

However, some of our scripts have not completely escaped the shortcomings of formulaic conceptualization. The thoughts and feelings of the characters are not deeply written, the plot is simple, and the composition and resolution of the contradictions are very easy. Hong Shen believes that these plays are due to the author's incomplete experience of life. He says that only knowing workers and trade unions, and not knowing the hard work and problems encountered by the administrative, Party, and League leadership, one cannot write a good play about industrial construction; only knowing the characters' activities in the office, but not knowing their activities, complex thoughts, feelings, and various preferences in every corner of life will make the characters dry and one-sided. He said: "If you want to write a thousand words for a factory director in a script, it is best to understand the three thousand words he said. Now, the average playwright has only heard fifty words spoken by a character, but writes three hundred words for him. How can this not be formulaic and conceptual?"

Tian Han also had the same feeling about the issue of immersing oneself in life. After returning from a visit to North Korea to comfort the troops, he wrote a multi-act play based on the heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Because he only went to the leadership organs of the troops far from the front line, and had little opportunity to visit the frontline tunnels, his understanding of the life of the soldiers was shallow, so the script was not published after it was written.

Speaking of repertoires, Mei Lanfang said that excellent opera scripts always focus on very refined and concentrated descriptions of themes. This is because they have been revised by playwrights and artists of all dynasties, so it is difficult to demand that new opera scripts be masterpieces in one go. New playwrights often understand less about opera or find it difficult to understand whether it is suitable for artists to sing, and they still have to rely on artists to modify and process it. He believes that the publication of the "Beijing Opera Series" and the "Ping Opera Series" is very effective for recommending good repertoires.

Zhou Xinfang pointed out: "The spirit of seeking truth from facts is needed in writing opera scripts. Small materials should be written into small-scale plays, and large materials should be written into large-scale plays." He believes that some playwrights have made small play materials large, so the plays appear loose, protracted, and not concentrated.

    Improve Spoken Drama Stage Art
Drama audiences demand good repertoires and also require improvements in stage art to vividly embody the play in front of the audience; this requires actors to implement realistic performance art, and improvements in music and art are also very important links. In recent years, many new atmospheres have also appeared on our drama stage. Hong Shen said: "Through immersing themselves in life and learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, drama actors have gained something in performing the ideological qualities of new heroic characters in recent years. Naturally, as a literary and art cadre, one should strictly demand oneself, study hard, and systematically study Marxist-Leninist and socialist realistic art theories, keenly observe social life and various characters. It is not enough to rely on petty cleverness." He believes that the typical ability, emphasis on exaggeration, detailed and concise expression ability, sense of stability and sculpture of movements, and ability to grasp language and audience emotions of excellent opera actors are all worth learning from drama actors.

Huang Zuolin talked about the experience of the Shanghai People's Art Theater in cultivating actors and improving artistic accomplishment. He said: In the past, actors studied performance theory before going on stage. The actors studied "Actor's Self-Cultivation," but they didn't understand it very well. Moreover, this book is one of the eight books of Stanislavsky's performance system. Sometimes, actors who have never been on stage read one book and become constrained, afraid to act. Now, it has been changed to actors first practicing on stage and then reading art theory books, which is easier to understand. However, a director or drama teacher must be proficient in Stanislavsky's theory and implement it into practical work in rehearsal or teaching. When rehearsing "Test" recently, they went to the motor factory to experience life. The director did not announce the list of role-playing in advance, so that the actors did not only focus on the characters and things related to the roles they played. They could broaden their horizons, pay attention to many problems in the factory's production and life, and also pay attention to observing more characters. It is easier to enter the play and make the characters they will create in the future fuller.

Zhao Dan realized that drama art has always had a realistic tradition, and now the path of socialist realism has been clarified. He pointed out that in the old society, the audience's worship of actors was somewhat abnormal and contaminated with the commercialized style of capitalist society. Today's art is a collectivist undertaking based on in-depth experience of life and combining individual creation with collective creation. It is impossible to perform a play well by relying only on famous actors. He said: "The talent of an actor requires hard work and cannot rely on genius. Often, the same play, performed by different actors, has a very different impact on the audience. The degree of difference is directly proportional to the labor spent on their cultivation in various aspects."

    Reform of Opera Stage
In the past five years, there has also been progress in the reform of opera stage art, as Ouyang Yuqian pointed out: Due to the education of ideological transformation, the artistic views of the artists have also changed. Vulgar stage images have been gradually eliminated, and performance art and music have been newly improved. The reform of opera music is only a preliminary attempt, but it is a good start.

The artists' humble and unremitting efforts in performance art are one of the important factors promoting the advancement of stage art. Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Zhou Xinfang, Yuan Xuefen, Chang Xiangyu, and other accomplished opera actors have set a good example for drama workers in their artistic and arduous research in recent years. Mei Lanfang is still constantly researching and improving his performances, constantly modifying the lyrics based on audience feedback and his own experience, and also pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of others' skills as much as possible. He visited North Korea to comfort the troops and performed in Anshan, performing a total of twenty-nine performances of "Drunken Concubine" (and other plays). People wondered why he always chose this play. He said, "I like this repertoire, so I am constantly improving the performance methods. There are still two movements to be studied." He has always paid attention to the purification of the stage, the improvement of music, and ensuring that every actor has a role to play and avoiding the problem of extras watching the play. He hopes that actors will have a collectivist spirit, because drama art is a difficult collective creation.

Based on her stage experience, Cheng Yanqiu emphasized that the most important thing to pay attention to in the artistic reform of opera is the unity of content and form. It is good if the scenery and props can render the plot and help the performance of the characters, but one should not focus solely on the scenery, causing the audience's attention to be shifted to the scenery. One should avoid the scenery overshadowing the actors and avoid the actors neglecting to improve their singing skills because of this. The charm of opera often lies in the fact that the singing of one or two actors on the stage can occupy the entire stage and tightly grasp the audience's emotions. She also said: "As a good actor, one should not only learn the character's personality and movements from the script, study the background of the repertoire, create and train singing, but also learn from life anytime and anywhere." In Sichuan, Cheng Yanqiu noticed another way of rowing a boat. This action is easy for Sichuan opera actors to understand, and actors of other genres can also refer to it.

Zhou Xinfang believes that if Peking Opera is reformed in music and appropriate actors are trained, it can perform modern plays. The problem is that actors need to have a wide range of interests and accomplishments in modern art departments, be good at studying new things, and not fall into the stylized set of Peking Opera performances. Reform is creation, and creation can lead to development. He said: "Beards, facial makeup, etc. can be gradually reformed. The main problem is the actor's performance art. Different acting skills should be used for people with different identities." "Our predecessor Huang San performed Cao Cao, performing Cao Cao with different personalities and temperaments according to his period. This is a valuable realistic tradition."

Some local opera genres have adopted a positive and forward-looking attitude in improving stage art, learning from fraternal opera genres, and developing their own genres more rapidly. For example, in order to enrich Yue opera singing, repertoires, and improve performance art, the East China Yue Opera Experimental Troupe has investigated and recorded singing from Sheng County, Shaoxing, and other places where Yue opera originated, and also unreservedly absorbed repertoires and performance art from other opera genres. They rehearsed "Reed Flower Record" from the Shaoxing class and also rehearsed "Judging Snow and Distinguishing Traces" and "Zhou Ren Offers His Sister-in-law" from Sichuan opera. Yuan Xuefen said: "We must strive to make Yue opera perform a variety of plays and not be limited to plays that express love. Naturally, boldness must be combined with seriousness, otherwise it will be uncoordinated. The same is true for performance art. Every actor in our troupe carefully studies the character of the role they play and tries to express this character in various ways." Chang Xiangyu also said: "My feeling in recent years is that art must be combined with life. Every action on the stage must not violate the truth of life, but it is not purely imitating life. For example, twisting thread and weaving cloth, it must not fail to conform to the actions of twisting thread and weaving cloth in life, but it cannot make the audience feel that it is better to visit twisting thread and weaving cloth."

Regarding the forms of opera performances, the strict adherence to and breakthroughs in rules, and the unity of performance styles, Ouyang Yuqian pointed out: "The improvement of opera stage art must be unified in style. Since content determines form, there is no need for the new content to cater to the traditional form 100%. In fact, the makeup on the stage and the makeup of the older generation of artists are already very different. The method of pulling apart the second curtain and the round field was not originally there. We must value the heritage and establish new opera art on the basis of tradition, but the newly established things will definitely not be the same as in the past and should be completely new things."

The playwright Ma Yanxiang, who has been participating in opera reform work for several years, emphasized the importance of cultivating various talents when further implementing opera reform work. We not only lack script writing talents, but also lack directors, music, and stage art talents. This year, we will successively open training courses and training classes to cultivate these talents. In order to improve the political and artistic accomplishment of senior actors of various opera genres, the Central Ministry of Culture will hold senior actor training sessions starting next year, and provinces and cities with conditions can also hold training sessions for general actors. State-owned troupes should regularly provide guidance to private professional troupes. Ma Yanxiang said: "In order to adapt to the level of socialist culture, we must improve the quality of art. The preservation and development of the life of opera art relies on active and meticulous reforms. Naturally, this still needs to be carried out based on the conditions of the artists and local new literary and art workers."

    戏剧家们对戏剧工作的意见
    本报记者  子冈
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕之前，记者访问了代表中的一部分戏剧家田汉、欧阳予倩、梅兰芳、洪深、曹禺、马彦祥、程砚秋、周信芳、黄佐临、赵丹、袁雪芬、常香玉。他们对五年来戏剧工作上的成绩和当前几个主要问题，发表了意见。
      发展创作，丰富剧目
    代表们都非常重视剧本创作问题。这一方面有了不少的收获。话剧创作方面出现了“龙须沟”、
  “在新事物的面前”、“四十年的愿望”、“战线南移”、“春风吹到诺敏河”、“六号门”、“春华秋实”、“妇女代表”等比较为群众所喜爱的剧本。最近曹禺写了“明朗的天”，夏衍写了“考验”，陈其通写了“万水千山”。五年来我们也整理了一些各种戏曲剧种的传统剧目，保留了其中的人民性的艺术精华，剔除了夹杂在其中的封建糟粕的杂质。经过了全国第一届戏曲观摩演出大会之后，戏剧界更普遍认识了戏曲遗产的丰富，以及包含在许多传统剧目中的现实主义传统。
    剧本创作上的成就，说明了剧作家们在学习和深入生活方面都有进步。正如欧阳予倩所指出的，
  “五年来无论新老话剧剧作家都努力学习，对于人民新的生活，有了更深刻而广泛的认识，有些剧作家已经由标语口号转到描写生活的真实；有些剧作家已经注意到为内容而选择形式和运用技巧，他们逐渐有计划地研读历史和中外的古典作品。这一切会使作品的质量得到提高。”曹禺为了写“明朗的天”，曾再三地到医院去体验生活。他说：“一个好画家写生，必须善于从人物事物各个角度去描画，只知一面是不够的，写剧本也是如此。写戏的人有责任把事物看得深刻一些，全面一些，写得精炼一些，尖锐一些。因此，除了尽量理解人的生活和人的内心活动以外，还需要有独立的思考能力，真能把马克思列宁主义运用到创作里。这个道理我懂，但我还做不到，所以这个戏没有写好。我现在正继续修改。”曹禺一再提起在他的创作过程里，他亲身体会到的党对文艺事业的无限关怀。任何地方的门对他都是开着的，使他有充分的机会接触各种各样的人物和思想。在他的创作遇到困难的时候，总是党的有力的手支持了他，使他才写完了这个戏。
    但是，我们还是有些剧本没有完全脱出公式化概念化的缺点，人物的思想感情写得不深厚，故事情节简单，其中矛盾的构成及解决都极平易。对这些剧作，洪深认为是由于：作者体验生活不全面。只知工人、工会，不知道行政、党、团等领导上所花的心血、所碰到的问题，是写不好一个有关工业建设的剧本的；只知道人物在办公室中的活动，而不知道他在生活各个角落的活动，复杂的思想感情和各种喜好，也是会把人物写得干枯、片面的。他说：“如果要在一个剧本中写厂长一千句话，最好要了解他所说的三万句话，而现在的一般剧作者，往往只听过一个人物所说的五十句话，却给他写了三百句话，这怎么能够不公式化概念化呢？”
    田汉对深入生活问题也有同样感受。他赴朝慰问归来后曾写成一个以人民志愿军英勇事迹为题材的多幕剧。因为他只到了离前线较远的部队领导机关，很少可能访问第一线坑道，对战士生活体会较浅，所以剧本写成以后也没有发表。
    梅兰芳谈到剧目时说：优秀的戏曲剧本总是非常洗炼、集中描写主题，这是因为经过了历代编剧家和艺人的修改，因此很难要求新的戏曲剧目一编就是个杰作。新的编剧者往往懂戏较少，或难以揣摩艺人演唱时合适不合适，还是要依靠艺人修改加工。京剧丛刊和评剧丛刊的出版，他认为对推荐好剧目的工作很有效。
    周信芳指出：“实事求是的精神是写作戏曲剧本所需要的，小材料写成小路子戏，大材料写成大路子戏。”他认为有些剧作者把小戏材料铺排大了，因此戏显得松懈、拖沓、不集中。
      提高话剧舞台艺术
    戏剧观众要求好的剧目，还要求改进舞台艺术，把剧作形象地体现在观众面前；这就要求演员贯彻现实主义表演艺术，而音乐、美术的改进也是很重要的环节。近年来，我们的戏剧舞台上也出现了不少新的气象。洪深说：“话剧演员们这些年来通过深入生活、向工农兵学习，在表演新的英雄人物的思想品质上是有收获的。自然，作为一个文艺干部，更应该严格地要求自己，刻苦学习，必须系统地学习马克思列宁主义和社会主义现实主义的艺术理论，敏锐地观察社会生活和各式各样人物，只凭小聪明是不行的。”他认为优秀戏曲演员的典型化的能力，强调夸张的能力，细致而简练的表现能力，动作的稳定感雕塑感，掌握语言和观众情绪的能力，都是值得话剧演员学习的。
    黄佐临谈到上海人民艺术剧院培养演员提高艺术修养的经验。他说：过去是未上舞台就先学演剧理论，演员们研读“演员自我修养”，其实也不甚理解，何况这本书是史坦尼斯拉夫斯基演剧体系著作八本中的一本，有时没上过台的演员读了一本，反而束手束脚，弄得不敢演戏了。如今改为演员先在舞台实践中锻炼，演了一些戏以后再读艺术理论书籍，就容易体会得多了。但是一个导演或戏剧教师必定要精通史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的理论，并且在排演或教学中贯彻到实践工作中去。最近排“考验”时，到电机厂去体验生活，导演不预先宣告角色扮演的名单，这样就使得演员们不只着眼于与自己扮演的角色有关的人物事物，可以放大眼界，注意工厂的生产、生活中的许多问题，也留心观察较多的人物，就比较容易进入到戏里去，也容易使自己将来创造的角色比较丰满。
    赵丹体会到话剧艺术一直有现实主义传统，现在更加明确了社会主义现实主义的道路。他指出，在旧社会里观众对演员的崇拜是有些不正常的，有些沾染了资本主义社会商业化的作风，而今天的艺术事业是以深入体验生活为基础的、以个人的创作与集体创作相结合的集体主义的事业，只依靠名演员是演不好一台戏的。他说：“演员的才能是需要下苦功的，不能依恃天才，往往同样一个戏，被不同的演员演起来，给观众的感染力就大不相同。而其不同的程度，是和他们在各方面的修养所花的劳动成正比例的。”
    戏曲舞台上的改革
    五年以来，在戏曲舞台艺术的改革方面也有进步，正如欧阳予倩所指出的：由于思想改造的教育，艺人们的艺术观点也有所改变。庸俗的舞台形象逐渐被肃清，表演艺术和音乐都有新的改进。戏曲音乐的改革虽不过是初步的尝试，却是好的开始。
    艺术家们在表演艺术上的虚心的、不懈的努力，是促使舞台艺术向前发展的重要因素之一。梅兰芳、程砚秋、周信芳、袁雪芬、常香玉和其他有成就的戏曲演员们近年来在艺术上的刻苦钻研，为戏剧工作者们树立了良好的榜样。梅兰芳至今仍时时刻刻在研究改进自己的表演，还根据观众反应和自己的体会不断修改剧词，也尽可能指出别人的技艺短长。他赴朝慰问及在鞍山演出，一共演了二十九场“贵妃醉酒”（也演了别的戏）。人家奇怪他为什么总选这出。他说，“我喜欢这个剧目，所以不断地在改进表演方法，至今有两个身段还待研究。”他对于舞台的净化、音乐的改进以及使每个演员都有戏可演、避免龙套看戏的问题，是一向注意的。他希望演员们具备集体主义精神，因为戏剧艺术是一项艰难的集体创作。
    程砚秋根据自己的舞台经验，强调戏曲的艺术改革最应注意内容与形式的统一，布景道具如能渲染剧情、帮助角色的表演是好的，但不能专在布景上用心，致使观众的注意力转移到布景上去。应该避免布景的喧宾夺主，避免因此使得演员不注意提高自己的演唱技艺。戏曲的魅力就往往在于台上一两个演员的演唱能够占有了整个舞台，紧紧地掌握住观众的情绪。他又说：“作为一个好演员，不只应从剧本学习人物性格和动作，研究剧目背景，创造并锻炼唱腔，而且应该随时随地在生活中学习。”在四川，程砚秋就注意到另一种摇船法，这种动作川剧演员容易体会，其他剧种的演员也可以参考。
    周信芳相信京剧如果在音乐方面加以改革，再培养适当演员，是可以演现代剧的，问题是演员需要有对现代新艺术部门多方面的兴趣和修养，善于钻研新事物，表演上不落京剧表演中程式化的一套。改革就是创造，创造才能有发展。他说：“胡子、脸谱等等都可以逐步改革，主要是演员的表演艺术问题，对各种身份不同的人有不同的演技。”
  “我们的前辈黄三演曹操，按着他的时期演出不同性格气度的曹操来，这就是可贵的现实主义传统。”
    有一些地方剧种在改进舞台艺术方面采取了积极向前、勇于改革的态度，向兄弟剧种学习，使本剧种发展得更迅速。例如华东越剧实验剧团为了要丰富越剧唱腔、剧目，并且改进表演艺术，曾多方从产生越剧的老家嵊县、绍兴等地调查记录唱腔，也毫不保守地向其他剧种吸取剧目和表演艺术。他们排演了绍兴大班的“芦花记”，也排演了川剧的
  “评雪辨踪”和“周仁献嫂”。袁雪芬说：“我们要努力使得越剧演多种多样的戏，也不局限于表现爱情的戏。自然，大胆要和认真相结合，不然就不谐调了。在表演艺术上也是如此，我们剧团每一个演员认真揣摩自己所扮演的角色性格，多方来表现这种性格。”常香玉也说：“这几年我的感受是艺术一定要结合生活，舞台上每一个动作要不违背生活的真实，但又不是纯粹摹仿生活。例如搓线织布，既不能不符合生活中搓线织布的动作，又不能叫观众觉得还不如去参观搓线织布。”
    关于戏曲演出的形式、格律的谨守与突破和演出风格统一等问题，欧阳予倩指出：“戏曲舞台艺术的改进，在风格上必须统一。既是内容决定形式，新的内容也就没有必要百分之百的迁就传统的形式，事实上现在舞台上的化妆和老辈艺人的化妆早已有很多不同，二道幕、圆场拉开的搞法也不是原来就有的。我们必须重视遗产，在传统的基础上建立新的戏曲艺术，但是新建立起来的东西，绝对不会和过去一样，应当会是完全新的东西。”
    几年来一直参加戏曲改革工作的戏剧家马彦祥说到进一步贯彻戏曲改革工作时，强调指出培养各种人材的重要性。我们不仅缺乏编剧人材，尤其缺乏导演、音乐和舞台美术人材，今年将陆续开办讲习班和训练班，以培养这些人材。为了提高各剧种高级演员的政治、艺术修养，明年起中央文化部将举办高级演员讲习会，有条件的省市也可以举办一般演员的讲习会。国营剧团应经常给民间职业剧团作辅导工作。马彦祥说：“为了适应社会主义文化的水平，我们必须提高艺术质量。戏曲艺术生命的保持与发展，就依靠积极细致的改革，自然，这依然要在依靠艺人与当地新文艺工作者的条件下来进行。”
