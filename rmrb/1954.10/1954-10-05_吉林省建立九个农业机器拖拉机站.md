    Jilin Province Establishes Nine Agricultural Tractor Stations

    This autumn, Jilin Province has established four more agricultural tractor stations in Dehui, Fuyu, Yanji, and Jiaohe counties. Adding to the original five stations, the province now has a total of nine agricultural tractor stations. These nine stations possess a total of forty-nine tractors of various types (more than 1,100 horsepower), and a large number of other agricultural machines. This autumn, these nine stations will provide contract plowing services for two local state-owned farms, four collective farms, fifty-six agricultural producers' cooperatives, and some mutual aid teams. According to incomplete statistics from eight stations, the planned autumn plowing area totals more than 3,500 hectares, of which the Yushu station alone will plow 1,200 hectares. Currently, all stations are conducting autumn plowing and sowing for their contract service recipients.

    The crops grown using tractors by the original stations generally have higher yields than those grown using old farm tools. The more than eighteen hectares of wheat planted by the Yushu station using tractors, despite suffering three windstorms, still yielded an average of more than 800 kilograms per mu (approximately 1,600 kilograms per hectare). After seeing the benefits of using machines for farming with their own eyes, the peasants have been actively requesting to organize agricultural producers' cooperatives in order to use machines for farming on large areas of land. Guchengzi Village in Yushu County, which originally did not have a single agricultural producers' cooperative, has now organized three agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    吉林省建立九个农业机器拖拉机站
    吉林省今秋又在德惠、扶馀、延吉、蛟河四县建立四处农业机器拖拉机站。加上原有的五处，全省共有九处农业机器拖拉机站。这九个站共拥有各种不同类型的拖拉机四十九部（一千一百多马力），和大批其他农业机器。这九个站今秋要给两个地方国营农场，四个集体农庄、五十六个农业生产合作社及一部分互助组代耕。据八个站不完全统计，计划今年秋翻面积共三千五百多垧，其中榆树一个站即代耕一千二百垧。目前各站正在给各代耕对象进行秋耕秋种。
    原有各站使用拖拉机耕种的庄稼，普遍比旧农具耕种的产量高。榆树站用拖拉机种的十八垧多小麦，连遭三次风灾，平均每垧还打一千六百多斤。农民们亲眼看到了使用机器耕种的好处后，纷纷要求组织农业生产合作社，以便在大面积的土地上使用机器耕种。榆树县古城子屯原来没有一个农业生产合作社，现在也组织起三个农业生产合作社。
