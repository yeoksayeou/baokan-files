Glimpses of Donbass (Part 2)
— Notes from a Visit to Ukraine, No. 11
By Our Correspondent Li He

The day after descending into the "Chelyuskin Type" mine, we went down to the No. 13 mine of the "Soviet Coal Mine" Trust in Makeyevka (adjacent to Stalino). It was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1949 because of its rapid recovery after the war. The large-scale use of the "Donbass" coal mining combine in Donbass began in 1949 in this mine. Its workers overproduced 5,000 tons of coal for the country in the first half of the year.

The working face (heading) where the "Donbass" coal mining combine was located was far from the shaft. After descending to 163 meters below the horizontal level, we walked through transportation tunnels, crossed ventilation tunnels, and turned left and right, walking about four kilometers to reach our destination. On the double-track tunnel, a trolley pulled a string of coal cars away, and then loaded a string of timber for shoring. Fluorescent lights hung horizontally on the arched roof of the tunnel. Ventilation fans continuously pumped in fresh air.

The coal seam had a slight dip of six degrees. The coal seam being mined was half a person thick and 150 meters long. The coal mining combine had already moved uphill. We put on gloves, hung our miner's lamps on our collars, and crawled forward in the gaps of the newly mined coal seam. After crawling uphill for only a dozen meters, we sat up. In the dim light of the miner's lamp battery, we saw that the top was shiny black, the bottom was a pile of crushed coal, and the middle was supported by many half-person-high wooden pillars. After a short rest, we began to move forward using our palms, elbows, knees, and toes. When resting again, we saw a pneumatic drill placed next to the coal wall. This used to be the main tool for coal mining, but now it is only used to trim the corners that the coal mining combine cannot reach. I picked up the pneumatic drill and chiseled the coal wall a few times, and the shiny black coal chunks fell off with a crackling sound. All of them were good coal. After several rests, we crawled to a place one hundred twenty or thirty meters away and saw the "Donbass" coal mining combine working and the mining team.

The "Donbass" coal mining combine crawled in the middle of the coal seam. The machine body was slightly thinner than the coal seam. Its front chain drilling part used a string of cutters on the chain to cut the entire coal strip from the coal wall. Its middle rotor crushing part – using a row of toothed discs on the rod, then cut the coal strip into several pieces, and used the rod to crush the coal into small pieces easy to transport. Its rear chain coal loading part used chains and scrapers to load the rolling small coal chunks onto the automatic conveyor belt next to the coal mining combine. Sometimes there were pillars between the coal loading and mining parts of the machine, but the coal loading work was not affected. The coal mining and cutting parts were driven by one motor, and the coal loading parts were driven by another motor. The "Donbass" coal mining combine can mine, crush, and load 20,000 tons of coal per month in a coal seam one to 1.2 meters thick. On average, each worker can produce eight, nine, or ten tons of coal in one shift using it. When the machine was boilingly mining coal, special sprinklers sprayed water, so there was not much coal dust. Next to the coal seam, a rock hole was opened where one could stretch one's waist, and fresh air was sent in from there by a ventilation fan. The air circulated so well that the workers said that when they stopped working to rest, they even felt a little cool.

A mixed team worked around the coal mining combine, including the shift foreman, the main and deputy drivers, the pillar workers, the female worker in charge of the conveyor belt, and the female worker who checked the gas and ventilation conditions (because mechanization reduced labor, women were also used for lighter labor in coal mines, such as trolley drivers), a total of twelve people. Workers in the team all knew several jobs, which ensured the smooth progress of production. The driver was the decisive figure in production. The 29-year-old driver, Smolyakov, was originally a member of a collective farm, had six years of schooling, and had been working here since he studied at a coal mine training class nine years ago. He received a monthly salary and a bonus for overfulfilling the plan of 2,800 or 900 rubles. The four young workers had all attended factory-run schools attached to coal mines.

When the miners in this team saw that the visitors were Chinese comrades, they warmly chatted with us. They talked about production and life, and also talked about their desire for peace. They all said in unison: "China and the Soviet Union are one family." "If the friendship between China and the Soviet Union becomes more consolidated, the American war instigators will not dare to act recklessly."

In this working face where longwall mining was carried out with the "Donbass" coal mining combine, a one-day-one-cycle operation method was also implemented. The cycle started with the second shift. The workers of the second and third shifts used the coal mining machine to mine a row of coal seams 150 meters long and erected the pillars. The workers of the first shift pulled the coal mining machine back downhill, moved the conveyor belt, and prepared all the machine repairs, installations, and production. According to the chief engineer of the mine, Kvernel, if one cycle was completed in one day, the foreman could get a bonus of 100% to 150% of the base salary, and the workers could get a bonus of 50% to 100% of the base salary.

The scene of the "Donbass" coal mining combine working was deeply imprinted in our minds. In Stalino, we visited Alexander Davidovich Sukats, the chief designer of this machine and the winner of the Stalin Prize. According to him, the "Donbass" coal mining combine was invented in 1944 and began to be produced in 1949. It concentrated not only the wisdom of many designers but also the wisdom of many workers. Now it is difficult to find a mine that does not use this machine. After adopting many rationalization suggestions from technical personnel and workers from coal mines in various places, there are currently many types of "Donbass" coal mining combines produced, which are suitable for mining coal seams of different thicknesses and hardness in Kuzbass, Karaganda, Moscow, and Donbass. A type used to mine particularly thin coal seams is still being tested. The "Donbass" coal mining combine is not only widely used in the Soviet Union but also supplied to People's Democratic countries. China now has five and has ordered fifty more. Sukats said: Chinese comrades are enthusiastically learning to use this machine and plan to manufacture it themselves. The Soviet Union is giving all possible assistance.

In the coal mines, we saw that with the improvement of the level of mechanization, the workers all possessed a considerable amount of technical knowledge. Before participating in work, they all went through short-term training classes at the coal mine. Many people were learning at mine-run secondary technical schools in their spare time. The administrative leaders of the mines also understood technology. At the Donetsk Industrial Institute in Stalino, named after Khrushchev, we learned about the training of mining cadres. The Donetsk Industrial Institute was opened in 1921 at the request of workers and miners. At that time, the students, workers, and miners built the school buildings. Comrade Khrushchev once studied at this institute. Before the war, the industrial institute was divided into three departments: mining, metallurgy, and chemistry, with 2,700 students studying. Now it is divided into six departments and sixteen majors: mining, mining machinery, mine surveying, metallurgy, chemistry, and construction, and the number of students has doubled. The institute graduates 1,000 students every year. According to the president, Chaiher Antonovich Bogomolov, 90 percent of the cadres in Donbass coal mines graduated from here. Many employees of Donbass mines and factories study at the institute's branch and correspondence classes without leaving their production posts. The institute often sends people to mines and factories to give lectures and help production innovators summarize their experiences. The institute has cooperation contracts with many mines and factories.

Everywhere in the Donbass coal mines, the safety equipment that can be seen shows the Soviet state's concern for the labor protection of miners. We saw this concern more clearly at the National Makeyevka Mining Work Safety Scientific Research Institute. This research institute was established specifically for the safety of miners and has been around for 26 years. The fluorescent lights used in various mines were proposed by it. It covers an area of ​​30 hectares, has ten main experimental stations, and more than 600 staff members, ten of whom have won the Stalin Prize. According to the vice president, Abram Markovich Kotlyarevsky, the scale of the research institute ranks first in the world. It is directly under the Soviet Coal Mine Industry Department and is not only a research institution but also a national agency that inspects the safety of coal mine equipment. The machinery and equipment required by coal mines throughout the Soviet Union cannot be used without passing the safety inspection and permission of this research institute.

This research institute studies coal mine transportation, electrical equipment, mine air composition, and blasting phenomena, etc. In the transportation materials laboratory, large and small testing machines are arranged. They test the tensile strength of various steel cables used in coal mines. The laboratory also displays a safety equipment model of a cable car carrying people on a slope. When the cable breaks, the car will automatically stop relying on the safety equipment, and will not be greatly shaken. In the laboratory for preventing explosions caused by electrical equipment, researchers are inspecting electrical equipment and conducting explosion tests. Because the sparks emitted by electrical equipment can cause explosions of flammable gases in the mine. In the laboratory for mine air composition, researchers use physical instruments and chemical methods to measure the content of flammable gases in the mine air, so as to provide reference when designing ventilation equipment.

The achievements of the Makeyevka Mining Work Safety Scientific Research Institute are enormous. But the vice president told us before leaving: "We are not complacent about our achievements. Scientific work must be done without complacency. We must look forward."

    顿巴斯见闻（下）
    ——乌克兰访问记之十一
    本报记者　李何
    下了“契留斯金式的人”矿井的第二天，我们又下了马克耶夫卡市（与斯大林诺市毗邻）的“苏维埃煤矿”托拉斯的第十三号矿井。它在战后因为恢复很快，在一九四九年荣获列宁勋章。顿巴斯大量使用“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机就是在一九四九年从这个矿井开始的。它的工人在上半年为国家超额生产了五千吨煤。
    “顿巴斯”式联合采煤机所在的工作面（掌子）离井筒很远。我们下到水平面下一百六十三公尺以后，走过运输巷道、插过通风巷道，左转右折，步行了约四公里才到达目的地。在双轨的巷道上，一会儿电车头拉走一列煤车，一会儿又载来一列搭支柱用的木材。巷道的拱顶横挂着日光灯。通风机不断送进新鲜的空气。
    煤层有六度的少许坡斜。正被开采的煤层有半个人厚，一百五十公尺长。联合采煤机已经进到上坡去了。我们戴上手套，把矿灯挂在领子上，在才开采了的煤层缝隙间匍匐前进。向上坡爬不到十几公尺就坐起来了。借着矿灯蓄电池的微光，看到头顶是黑亮亮的，坐下是一片碎煤，中间支架着许多半人高的木柱。少许休息后，又开始用掌、肘、膝盖和脚尖行进。再休息时，看到煤壁旁边放着一架风镐。这在以前曾经是采煤的主要工具，现在只是用来修整联合采煤机达不到的角落了。我拿起风镐向煤壁凿了几下，黑亮的煤块毕剥地落下。尽是好煤。几番休息，爬到一百二三十公尺地方，见到了在工作中的“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机和矿工组。
    “顿巴斯”式联合采煤机在煤层中间爬动。机体比煤层稍薄。它的前头连环钻凿部分，用链子上的一串切刀，从煤壁切下整条煤。它的中间旋杆切碎部分——用杆上的一列齿盘，接着把煤条切成几块，并且用杆把煤打碎成便于装运的小块。它的后面连环装煤部分，用链子和刮具把滚滚的小煤块装到联合采煤机旁边的自动输送带上去。在机器的装煤和采煤部分之间有时隔着支柱，装煤工作不受影响。采煤、切煤机件由一个电动机发动，装煤机件由另一个电动机发动。“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机在一公尺到一点二公尺厚的煤层中每月能采、碎、装煤二万吨。平均每个工人在一个工作班时间用它能生产八、九、十吨煤。在机器沸腾地采煤时，有专门的喷射器洒水，所以不起什么煤尘。煤层旁边开辟一个可以伸腰的岩穴，从那里通风机送进新鲜的空气。空气流通得这样好，工人们说，把工作停下来休息的时候，甚至觉得有点凉快。
    围绕联合采煤机工作着一个混合组，包括值班工长、正副司机、支柱工人、照料输送带的女工、检查煤气和通风情形的女工（因为机械化减轻了劳动，煤井里像电车头司机等等较轻劳动也使用女工）等十二个人。组内工人都会几种工作，这保证生产顺利的进行。司机是生产中的决定性人物。二十九岁的司机斯摩里雅科夫原来是集体农庄庄员，念过六年书，九年前在煤矿训练班学习后来这里工作。他每月得到工资和超额完成计划的报酬二千八、九百卢布。四个年青工人都念过煤矿附设的厂矿学校。
    这一个组矿工们看见来的是中国同志，亲热地和我们攀谈起来。他们谈了生产和生活，也谈了对和平的愿望。他们异口同声地说：“中国和苏联是一家人。”“中苏友谊更加巩固，美国战争挑拨者就不敢乱动。”
    在这以“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机进行长壁采煤的工作面，也实行一昼夜一循环作业法。循环以第二班为起点。第二、三两班工人，用采煤机采完一百五十公尺长的一行煤层，架好支柱。第一班工人把采煤机拉回下坡，移动输送带，做好一切机器修理安装和生产准备工作。如果一昼完成了一循环，据矿井主任工程师克维尔那则说，工长可得到工资基数的百分之百到一百五十的奖金，工人可得到工资基数的百分之五十到一百的奖金。
      “顿巴斯”式联合采煤机工作的情景，深深印在我们脑子里。我们在斯大林诺访问了这个机器的总设计师、斯大林奖金获得者亚列克山得尔·达维多维奇·苏卡茨。据他谈：“顿巴斯”式联合采煤机是在一九四四年发明，一九四九年开始出产的。它不但集中了许多设计师而且许多工人的智慧。现在很难找到一个矿不用这个机器。采纳了各地煤矿技术人员和工人的许多合理化建议，目前出产有许多种“顿巴斯”联合采煤机，它们适用在开采库兹巴斯、卡拉甘达、莫斯科、顿巴斯各地厚薄和硬软不同的煤层。现在还在试验一种用在开采特别薄的煤层。“顿巴斯”联合采煤机不但在苏联广泛使用而且也供给人民民主国家。中国现在有五部，还订了五十部。苏卡茨说：中国同志热心学习使用这个机器，并且计划自己制造它。苏联方面在给予一切帮助。
    在煤矿，我们看到随着机械化水平的提高，工人们都具备相当高的技术知识。他们在参加工作之前，都经过煤矿的短期训练班。很多人在业余进矿业中等技术学校学习。矿井的行政领导干部，也都懂得技术。在斯大林诺以赫鲁晓夫为名的顿内茨工业学院，我们了解了一下矿业干部培养的情形。顿内茨工业学院是一九二一年根据工人和矿工的要求开办的。当时由学生、工人和矿工建造了校舍。赫鲁晓夫同志曾经在这个学院学习过。工业学院在战前分矿、冶金、化学三系，有二千七百名学生学习。现在分矿、矿机械、矿测量、冶金、化学、建筑六系十六个专业，学生增加一倍。学院每年有一千名学生毕业。据院长采海尔·安东诺维奇·鲍格莫洛夫说：顿巴斯煤矿百分之九十的干部是从这里毕业出去的。顿巴斯的很多矿厂职工不脱离生产地在学院的分院和函授班学习。学院经常派人到矿厂去做讲演和帮助生产革新者总结经验。学院和许多矿厂订有合作合同。
    在顿巴斯煤矿中处处可见的安全设备，表现着苏维埃国家对矿工劳动保护的关怀。这种关怀，我们在国立马克耶夫卡矿业工作安全科学研究院看的更清楚。这个研究院是专门为矿工的安全设立的，已经有二十六年历史。各处矿井中采用的日光灯，就是由它提议的。它占地三十公顷，有十个主要的实验站，六百多个工作人员，其中十人得过斯大林奖金。据副院长阿布拉木·马尔科维奇·科特里雅列夫斯基谈：研究院的规模占世界第一位。它直属于苏联煤矿工业部，不仅是研究机关而且是国家检查煤矿设备安全的机关。全苏联煤矿所需的机器设备，如果没有经过这个研究院的安全检查和许可，不能采用。
    这个研究院研究煤矿运输、电气设备、矿内空气成份以及爆破现象等等。在运输材料实验室，排列着大小测力机。它们试验煤矿用的各种钢缆的拉力。实验室还陈列一个斜坡载人的缆车的安全设备模型。缆断时，车子靠安全设备会自动停下，而且不受很大震动。在预防电气设备引起爆炸的实验室，研究人员在检查电气设备和进行爆炸试验。因为电气设备发出的火花，会引起矿中可燃气体的爆炸。在矿内空气成份实验室，研究人员用物理仪器和化学方法，在测定矿内空气中所含的可燃气体的情况，以便设计通风设备时参考。
    马克耶夫卡矿业工作安全科学研究院的成绩是巨大的。但副院长临别告诉我们说：“我们不自满于自己的成绩。做科学工作必须这样不自满。要向前看。”
