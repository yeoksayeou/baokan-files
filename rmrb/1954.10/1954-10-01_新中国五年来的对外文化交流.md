Five Years of Foreign Cultural Exchange in New China
Hong Shen

The Chinese people not only love their own country's culture, which has a long historical tradition, but also respect the ancient and modern cultures of other countries, hoping to enhance mutual understanding and trust through cultural exchanges. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China five years ago, the Chinese people have been carrying out cultural exchanges with various countries with such noble aspirations.

In the past five years, China's cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union have greatly developed, and the upsurge of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country has vigorously promoted China's various construction undertakings; cultural exchanges with many other countries have also been vigorously developing and have achieved great results.

The epoch-making Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance explicitly stipulates the development and consolidation of cultural relations between China and the Soviet Union; China has also signed cultural cooperation agreements and scientific and technological cooperation agreements with many people's democratic countries. This uses the form of a treaty to plan for constantly developing cultural exchange activities between each other.

In the past five years, the people of our country and the people of various countries have sent a large number of cultural delegations to visit each other, and the number has been increasing year by year. As of the end of August 1954, a total of more than 700 people from our country's science, literature, art, and sports delegations had visited more than 20 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. They were not only widely welcomed in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, but also warmly received by the people of many other countries. The scientific delegation composed of 42 Chinese scientists visited the Soviet Academy of Sciences and went deep into various scientific research institutions to conduct visits, which greatly inspired the development of scientific research in China. In 1952, the Chinese Cultural and Educational Observation Group conducted inspections in six fraternal countries in Eastern Europe, exchanging information and experience on cultural and educational construction. At the end of 1953, the delegation of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association to India appreciated the beautiful cultural arts of the Indian people in Delhi and many other places, and met directly with approximately 250,000 Indian people, receiving more than 3,000 garlands that they enthusiastically presented.

During the same period, the Chinese people warmly received more than 550 cultural representatives from approximately 20 countries. In October 1949, our great friend, the Soviet Union, sent a delegation of 43 cultural, artistic, and scientific workers to participate in our country's founding ceremony and conduct visits. Five cultural delegations from Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania visited our country in the autumn of 1953, with a total of 55 people, divided into more than 10 majors. They conducted in-depth exchanges of experience with relevant Chinese experts in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang and other places through visits, interviews, and symposiums. The Indian cultural delegation headed by Mrs. Pandit, the Burmese cultural delegation headed by U Tun Hpa, Indonesian composers and reporters, Pakistani and Ceylonese religious leaders, Japanese actors and painters, British scientists, famous French writers, Italian philosophy professors, and famous American poets also visited our country. They not only visited scenic spots and historical sites that reflect China's long and rich cultural heritage, and witnessed the achievements of China's cultural construction, but also widely contacted the real life of people from all walks of life in China, visited the Guanting Reservoir construction site, factory nurseries, and worshiped in churches. After returning to their countries, they all issued statements, gave speeches, or published books to publicize their personal experiences, making important contributions to promoting the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of various countries.

Mutual visits by art performance groups play a great role in communicating thoughts and feelings between people and developing cultural exchanges. As of August this year, our country has sent a total of seven groups, more than 1,350 people; and 16 groups from various countries have come to China, more than 1,900 people. The Chinese Youth Art Troupe performed successively in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe, and participated in the World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival, receiving a warm welcome from hundreds of thousands of audiences. The China Acrobatic Troupe visited Finland, Denmark, and Sweden in Northern Europe in 1952, and toured 67 cities, receiving unanimous praise from more than 100,000 audiences.

During the Sino-Soviet Friendship Month in 1952, the Soviet Art Troupe and the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble traveled to 20 cities in our country, performing more than 140 shows, with 900,000 audience members, and broadcasting or rebroadcasting the performances 22 times, with 25.5 million organized listeners. Song and dance troupes, acrobatics troupes, and music teams from North Korea, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Mongolia, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and Bulgaria have also come to our country one after another. Their wonderful programs, which showed the excellent national traditions and the happy life of the working people after liberation, were warmly welcomed by the vast audience in our country. The Chinese people also appreciated with great interest the artistic performances that demonstrated the excellent cultural traditions of the Indian people; recently, the Indonesian art troupe performed in many cities in our country, receiving unanimous praise.

Art performance groups from many countries learn programs from each other with China's art circles, which plays a profound role in cultural exchanges between the people. Just as Hungarian bottle dances can be seen on the stage in Beijing, and people skillfully sing the Polish song "Little Cuckoo", our Peking Opera "San Cha Kou" has also been performed by Soviet comrades in Moscow, and the song "The East is Red" is being sung by people in many parts of the world.

The Chinese people love the literary works and scientific treatises of progressive writers from all over the world. As of the end of June this year, we have translated and published more than 7,000 kinds of books from various countries. The classic works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and other revolutionary leaders are being systematically introduced to the Chinese people. The Chinese version of the Complete Works of Stalin has also begun to be published. The Chinese people not only show unparalleled love for famous works such as "How Steel Was Tempered", "The Story of Zoya and Shura", and "An Ordinary Soldier" which describe the socialist moral character of the Soviet people, drawing spiritual strength from them to build their own motherland, but also greatly appreciate many other countries' classical and modern literary works, such as Aristophanes' comedies and Aldrich's "The Diplomat". These works are popular among a wide readership. Not long ago, the Chinese literary translation community held a meeting in Beijing under the leadership of the Chinese Writers Association to discuss how to more systematically translate a large number of world-famous works in order to meet the growing demands of the Chinese people in this regard.

Organizing exhibitions is also an important way of cultural exchange. As of the end of August 1954, our country had organized a total of 164 exhibitions to be exhibited around the world, and at the same time assisted the people of various countries in holding 60 exhibitions in China. From 1952 to 1953, the "Exhibition of the Hungarian People's Republic" exhibited in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou attracted 2.25 million visitors. The Soviet Exhibition Hall, with a total construction volume of more than 310,000 cubic meters, has been completed in Beijing, and it will introduce the great achievements of the Soviet Union in various aspects such as economy and culture to the Chinese people starting from October this year.

Exchanging films and radio programs is a cultural exchange activity that affects a wide range of people. Our country has signed radio cooperation agreements and film exchange contracts with various people's democratic countries, and has also held film weeks with each other. Our films have met audiences in about 60 countries and participated in various international film festivals. "The White-Haired Girl", "Steel Warrior", "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" and many other films have been unanimously praised by the people of various countries. Films from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries have become valuable spiritual food for the Chinese people. Japanese progressive films "No, We Want to Live" have met with a wide audience in China; progressive films from many other countries are also being translated and dubbed, preparing for release.

China's largest national library - the Beijing Library - has established book exchange relations with 60 cultural and educational units in 21 countries, including the Soviet Union. As of June 1954, China had sent out approximately 700,000 books and periodicals to foreign countries, and received more than 300,000 books and periodicals from various countries.

In May of this year, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries was established in Beijing under the initiative of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and other 10 people's organizations. It will make great contributions to developing the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world, and promoting cultural exchanges.

After the Geneva Conference, the voices of the people of all countries calling for improving international relations and enhancing economic and cultural exchanges between countries are rising day by day; China's international status has also been unprecedentedly improved. We firmly believe that those who promote cosmopolitanism and attempt to use human power to hinder cultural exchanges and mutual trust between people, a small group of dregs of humanity, cannot withstand the impact of the tide of the times.

The preamble of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The policy of our country to establish and develop diplomatic ties with any country on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity has achieved success and will continue to be implemented in the future. In international affairs, our country's unwavering policy is to strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress." This is not only a summary of the work of the People's Republic of China in international affairs in the five years since its founding, but it will also guide the further development of our people's foreign cultural exchange work to meet the growing demands of the people at home and abroad in this regard.

    新中国五年来的对外文化交流
    洪深
    中国人民不但热爱自己祖国有着悠久历史传统的文化，而且也尊重其他国家古代的和现代的文化，希望通过相互间的文化交流，以增进相互的了解和信任。中华人民共和国成立五年以来，中国人民就以这样崇高的意愿，开展了和各国的文化交流。
    五年来，我国和苏联的文化交流有了很大的开展，在全国范围内掀起的学习苏联的热潮，有力地推动了我国的各项建设事业；和其他许多国家的文化交流也在蓬勃地发展着，并且获得了巨大的成绩。
    划时代的中苏友好同盟互助条约中明确地规定了发展和巩固中苏两国之间的文化关系；我国和许多人民民主国家也签订了文化合作协定和科学技术合作协定。这是用条约的形式，规划了彼此之间不断发展的文化交流活动。
    五年来，我国人民和各国人民互相派遣了大量的文化代表团互相访问，而且其数量在逐年增长着。截至一九五四年八月底为止，我国的科学、文学、艺术、体育的代表团共约七百余人，曾到亚洲、欧洲、美洲的二十余个国家进行访问。他们不仅在苏联和各人民民主国家受到广泛的欢迎，而且也受到其他许多国家的人民的热情款待。由我国四十二位科学工作者组成的科学代表团访问了苏联科学院，并深入各科学研究机构进行参观，这对我国科学界开展研究工作有巨大的启发作用。一九五二年我国文化教育考察团在东欧六个兄弟国家进行考察，交流了双方文教建设的情况和经验。一九五三年底赴印度的中印友好协会代表团在德里及其他许多地方欣赏了印度人民优美的文化艺术，并和约二十五万印度人民直接见面，接受了他们热情赠送的三千个以上的花环。
    同一时期，我国人民热情地接待了来自约二十个国家的文化代表共五百五十余人。一九四九年十月，我们的伟大友邦苏联派来了为数达四十三人的文化艺术科学工作者代表团参加我国开国典礼，并进行访问。波兰、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚五个文化代表团于一九五三年秋天来我国访问，总共五十五人，分十多个专业，他们在北京、上海、广州、武汉、沈阳等地通过参观、访问、座谈分别和我国有关专家进行了深入的经验交流。来我国访问的还有以潘迪特夫人为首的印度文化代表团，有以宇吞帕为首的缅甸文化代表团，有印度尼西亚的作曲家和记者，有巴基斯坦和锡兰的宗教界领袖，有日本的演员和画家，也有英国的科学家、法国的著名作家、意大利的哲学教授，和美洲的著名诗人等。他们不但游览了表现我国悠久而丰富的文化遗产的名胜古迹，亲眼看到了我国文化建设的成就，而且广泛地接触了我国各阶层人民的现实生活，参观了官厅水库工地、工厂托儿所，并在教堂里做了礼拜。他们回国后都曾发表声明、演说或出版著作等来宣传自己亲身的经历，对促进中国人民和各国人民的友谊作了重要的贡献。
    艺术表演团体的相互访问，在沟通人民之间的思想情感、开展文化交流方面有着莫大的作用。截至今年八月，我国共派出了七个团，一千三百五十余人；各国来华的，达十六个团，一千九百余人。我国青年文艺工作团先后在苏联及东欧各人民民主国家演出，并参加了世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节，受到数十万观众的热烈欢迎。中国人民杂技团于一九五二年访问了北欧的芬兰、丹麦、瑞典三国，在六十七个城市中巡回演出，受到十余万观众的一致赞赏。
    一九五二年中苏友好月时，苏联艺术工作团和红旗歌舞团在我国旅行了二十个城市，演出一百四十余场，观众九十万人，演出的广播或转播大会二十二次，有组织的听众达两千五百万人。先后来我国的还有朝鲜、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、蒙古、波兰、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚的歌舞团或杂技团、音乐队等。他们那些表现了优良的民族传统和解放后劳动人民幸福生活的精采节目，无不受到我国广大观众的热烈欢迎。我国人民还以极大的兴趣欣赏了表现印度人民优良文化传统的艺术表演；最近印度尼西亚艺术工作团在我国许多城市演出，获得了一致的赞扬。
    许多国家的艺术表演团都和我国艺术界互相学习彼此的节目，这对人民之间的文化交流起着深远的作用。正如在北京的舞台可以看到匈牙利的瓶舞，人们熟练地唱着波兰的歌曲“小杜鹃”一样，我们的京剧“三岔口”也已由苏联同志在莫斯科演出，“东方红”的歌声在世界许多地方为人们颂唱着。
    我国人民热爱世界各国进步作家的文学作品和科学论著。截至今年六月底止，我们共翻译出版了各国的书籍七千余种。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林及其他革命领袖的经典著作正在被有系统的介绍给中国人民。斯大林全集中文版也已开始出版了。中国人民不仅对于像“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“卓娅和舒拉的故事”、“普通一兵”等描写苏维埃人社会主义道德品质的名著表现了无比的热爱，从中吸取着建设自己祖国的精神力量，并且对于阿里斯多芬的喜剧，阿尔德里奇的“外交家”等许多其他国家的古典的和现代的文学作品也都极为欣赏。这些作品在广大读者中流行着。不久以前，我国文学翻译界在中国作家协会的领导下在北京举行了会议，讨论如何更有计划地大量翻译世界名著，以满足我国人民在这方面日益增长的要求。
    组织展览会也是文化交流的重要方式之一。截至一九五四年八月底为止，我国共组织了一百六十四个展览会到世界各地展出，同时协助各国人民在中国举办了六十个展览会。一九五二年至一九五三年，在北京、上海、广州展出的“匈牙利人民共和国展览会”，观众达二百二十五万人。总建筑体积达三十一万多立方公尺的苏联展览馆，已在北京建成，它将自今年十月起向中国人民介绍苏联经济、文化等各方面的伟大成就。
    交换影片和广播节目是影响广泛群众的文化交流活动之一。我国和各人民民主国家大都订立了广播合作协定和影片交换合同，并曾互相举办电影周。我国影片和约六十个国家的观众见了面，并参加了各种国际电影节。“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”、
  “梁山伯与祝英台”及其他许多影片都受到各国人民一致的赞许。苏联和各人民民主国家的电影，已经成为中国人民珍贵的精神食粮。日本进步影片
  “不，我们要活下去”等已和中国广大观众见面；其他许多国家的进步影片也正在进行翻译配音，准备上映。
    中国最大的国家图书馆——北京图书馆和苏联等二十一个国家的六十个文化教育单位建立了交换图书的关系。至一九五四年六月为止，中国向国外送出了约七十余万册书刊，收到各国书刊三十余万册。
    今年五月，在中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国文学艺术界联合会等十个人民团体的发起下，在北京成立了中国人民对外文化协会。它将为发展中国人民和世界各国人民的友好关系、促进文化交流作出巨大的贡献。
    日内瓦会议以后，各国人民要求改善国际关系、增进各国间的经济和文化交流的呼声日益高涨；中国的国际地位也空前提高。我们深信，那些宣传世界主义，企图以人为的力量阻碍人民间的文化交流和互相信任的一小撮人类的败类是经不起时代潮流的冲击的。
    中华人民共和国宪法的序言中规定：“我国根据平等、互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系的政策，已经获得成就，今后将继续贯彻。在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”这不但是对中华人民共和国成立五年来在国际事务方面工作的一个总结，同时它也将指导我国人民的对外文化交流工作获得更进一步的发展，以满足国内外人民在这方面日益增长的要求。
