Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing are actively participating in the work of establishing and expanding agricultural production cooperatives. As of now, 104 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the suburbs. More than 30,000 households have joined or requested to join the cooperatives, a three-fold increase compared to the number of households in the original agricultural cooperatives. Including the households in the original agricultural cooperatives, the number of participating households in the suburbs has reached 33% of the total number of farm households. In the Shijingshan District, the number of households participating in agricultural cooperatives has reached 66% of the total number of farm households in the district. It is expected that the number of farm households joining cooperatives in the entire suburbs of Beijing this winter and next spring will reach 45% of the total number of farm households.

The Rural Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China began studying the plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs this winter and next spring as early as July this year. From mid-August, the district committees began to hold training classes for cadres building cooperatives, training more than 7,600 people, including party members, activists, directors of agricultural cooperatives, and mutual aid team leaders. The districts also transferred more than 300 cadres to the countryside to carry out propaganda, deliberation, and preparatory work for building cooperatives. Because the preparatory work was relatively good, the work of building and expanding cooperatives has also progressed relatively smoothly.

The characteristics shown by farmers in the suburbs of Beijing in building and expanding cooperatives this year are that the idea of cooperativization has taken root in the hearts of the people, the enthusiasm of farmers to run cooperatives is generally high, and the proportion of old and middle peasants joining cooperatives has increased significantly. For example, in Fengtai District, after only one round of propaganda and deliberation, nearly half of the middle peasants signed up to join the cooperatives. Farmers in vegetable-growing areas and disaster areas are even more enthusiastic about participating in cooperatives. In the past, most of the activists in running cooperatives were young people. This year, many elderly farmers have also become activists in running cooperatives. An elderly farmer in Wuligou Township in the eastern suburbs said at an activist training class: "There is strength in numbers. The crops of the cooperatives are better than anyone else's. If we don't take the socialist road, what road should we take?"

    北京郊区农民积极参加农业生产合作社
    北京郊区农村已展开建立和扩大农业生产合作社的工作。截至目前为止，郊区已新建立起一百零四个农业生产合作社。已经入社和要求入社的农民有三万多户，比原有农业合作社的户数增加三倍；加上原有农业合作社的户数，郊区参加社的已达总农户数的百分之三十三。石景山区参加农业合作社的已占该区农户总数的百分之六十六。北京全郊区今冬明春入社的农户可望达到总农户数的百分之四十五。
    中共北京市委农村工作委员会，早在今年七月就已经开始研究郊区今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的计划。从八月中旬起，各区区委开始举办建社干部训练班，训练党员、积极分子、农业合作社主任、互助组长等共七千六百余人，各区并抽调三百多干部下乡进行宣传、酝酿和预备建社的工作。因为准备工作比较好，所以建社、扩社工作开展的也比较顺利。
    北京郊区农民今年在建社、扩社中所表现的特点是，合作化的思想深入人心，农民办社的情绪普遍高涨，老中农入社比重显著增加，如丰台区，只经过一次宣传酝酿，报名入社的中农即将近中农户数的一半，在菜区、灾区的农民参加合作社的积极性更高。往年办社时，积极分子中绝大多数是青年，今年很多的老年农民也成了办社的积极分子，东郊区五里沟乡一个老年农民在积极分子训练班上说：“人多力量大，合作社的庄稼谁都比不了，我们不走社会主义的路，还走什么路呢？”
