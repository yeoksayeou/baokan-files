A staff officer of a naval fleet of the East China People's Navy, beaming with a smile, excitedly delivered a congratulatory telegram from the naval fleet commander to the captain's room. The telegram read:
"You fought very resolutely and tenaciously today, with fast and fierce firepower. We hope you will increase your vigilance a hundredfold, intensify training, continue your efforts, make all preparations, resolutely crush the harassing activities of the Chiang bandit army, and strive for greater victories!"
It was at dawn one summer this year when this warship, along with the command ship, was patrolling the sea off a certain area in eastern Zhejiang. It was drizzling at the time. After working all night, the sailors were a little tired, but they knew that the Chiang bandit navy, which had suffered heavy blows from our army, might take advantage of the rainy weather to launch a surprise attack on our ship. Therefore, everyone kept their eyes wide open, closely monitoring the sea.
The warship advanced along the scheduled patrol route, with islands quickly moving backward on both sides of the warship. As expected, the lookout suddenly sent an urgent shout from the bow of the ship:
"Report to the command, five enemy warships sighted at 15 degrees to port, approaching us!"
"Prepare for battle! Advance according to the original course!" The detachment commander gave the order while raising his binoculars to carefully observe the movements of the Chiang bandit warships.
The warship and the command ship quickly changed from patrol formation to combat formation, and the sailors immediately entered their respective combat positions. At this time, five Chiang bandit warships formed a single column and approached us at high speed. The distance between the enemy and us quickly shortened. Before long, the flashes of cannon fire appeared on the Chiang bandit warships.
Our warships emerged from the water columns stirred up by the enemy's shells and continued to advance. The Chiang bandits thought that our ship was avoiding battle and became even more frantic. They abandoned the two slower ships behind, and while firing, continued to approach us at high speed. Our resourceful and calm sailors suppressed the excitement in their hearts and thought secretly, "Pigs, fools, you're hooked!"
The captain on the command platform and the detachment commander on the command ship, while directing the battle, observed the activities of the Chiang bandit warships and the distribution of the shells exploding around our ship. From countless naval battles, the sailors had become familiar with the commander's temperament: in every naval battle, the detachment commander always actively looked for any opportunity to strike the enemy. Especially when outnumbered, he showed even more his resourcefulness, flexibility, calmness, and decisiveness in command. So whenever they talked about the detachment commander, the sailors always proudly and approvingly said: "With a detachment commander who can command himself and command the enemy, victory will always belong to us!"
The Chiang bandit warships frantically fired shells and rapidly approached our warships. Main gun aimer Yan Baofu and his comrades aimed all the gun muzzles at the enemy ships, waiting for the order to fire.
"Full rudder to port, heading 45 degrees, prepare to fire!" As soon as the captain's order was given, Yan Baofu and his gunners quickly rotated the guns, the muzzles following the enemy ships like magnets. At this time, all five Chiang bandit warships appeared in Yan Baofu's sights, only ×× chains away (one chain equals ten nautical miles). The sailors were extremely happy: what a good distance for a decisive battle! The Chiang bandit warships happened to be in a single column diagonally facing our ship, and about half of the enemy's firepower was ineffective. If its rear main guns fired, it would be smashing its own brains. On the right side of the enemy ships, there were many reefs restricting their maneuverability.
Just as the sailors were secretly admiring the good combat position chosen by the captain, the captain suddenly issued a loud command:
"Target, enemy ship number one, ready—fire!"
Yan Baofu "swished" and quickly moved the aiming point to the command platform of the Chiang bandit's number one warship, and countless tongues of fire spewed out from the ship's guns at the same time. At this time, the fierce firepower of our command ship also shot towards the enemy's number one ship from another angle. Instantly, countless water columns rose around the Chiang bandit's number one ship. Immediately afterward, our ship's second salvo hit again. The Chiang bandit's number one ship was surrounded by our shells.
"Fire quickly!" Before the captain's loud command disappeared, groups of shells continuously flew to the cross-section of the Chiang bandit's number one ship and exploded, and a plume of thick smoke immediately rose near the enemy ship's bridge.
"Hit the enemy ship!" Yan Baofu almost laughed out loud, but he knew that at this crucial moment, firing one more shell would bring one more point of victory, and the faster he fired, the less the enemy could fight back. So, he tried his best to hold his breath, and the aiming point did not leave the Chiang bandit's number one ship for a second. The firepower became even fiercer, and the gun barrels of every cannon on our warship were constantly and rapidly extending and retracting. The continuous shells flew from two angles to the Chiang bandit's number one ship like fiery red iron balls. The Chiang bandit's number one ship's artillery fire was all silenced. Yan Baofu saw from the sight that the Chiang bandit's number one ship was tilting to the left and constantly making 360-degree turns. He said with both anger and amusement: "The enemy ship is going to act like a bear again!" Just as the enemy ship was trying to turn around and escape, the artillery fire from our warships continuously hit it again.
The naval battle was proceeding fiercely, and the sailors all wanted to see the miserable state of the enemy ships being hit. The soldiers in the engine room all thought: How great it would be to go out and see now! The helmsman could see everything through the window with just a turn of his head. But this was impossible, as it would affect the stability of the heading angle and hinder the firing of the artillery. In this situation, if anyone was slightly negligent, the artillery fire would lose its accuracy, and the entire battle could be brought to failure by one person. Therefore, the sailors suppressed that strong desire and continued to carefully and skillfully operate the machinery under their control. The more fiercely the artillery fired, the more thoroughly they checked their machinery, thus ensuring that all the complex machinery of the ship achieved a high degree of coordination and unity, ensuring that the artillery fire continuously and accurately struck the enemy.
In order to cover the escape of the number one ship that was hit by our army, the Chiang bandit army put the number two ship up. Following the gunnery officer's order, our ship's gunners quickly locked the Chiang bandit's number two ship in the sight, and after a "fire quickly," flames flashed on the deck of the Chiang bandit's number two ship, and plumes of black smoke rose. The shells fired from our warships continued to explode on the enemy ships.
While our warships were expanding their victory, it suddenly started to rain heavily. Under the cover of thick fog, the Chiang bandit warships turned their rudders in panic and fled. As soon as the battle alarm was lifted, the sailors on our warships talked, laughed, sang, and danced excitedly, congratulating each other on the victory of this naval battle.
The naval battle ended victoriously. Our heroic People's Navy warship and command ship continued to advance according to the original patrol line, vigilantly guarding the beloved ocean of the motherland.

    海洋上的英勇战斗
    陆其明、顾勇
    华东人民海军某舰机要员，面带笑容，兴冲冲地把海军编队司令员发来的一份贺电送到舰长室里。电报上写着：
    “你们今天打得很坚决，很顽强，炮火又快又猛，希望你们百倍提高警惕，加紧训练，再接再厉，做好一切准备，坚决粉碎蒋贼军的骚扰活动，争取更大的胜利！”
    那是今年夏天的一个拂晓，这艘军舰同指挥舰巡逻在浙东某地的海面上。当时降着濛濛细雨。水兵们经过了一整夜的工作，已经有些疲劳，但是他们知道：屡遭我军沉重打击的蒋贼海军，很可能利用下雨天气，来向我舰进行偷袭。因此，每个人都睁大了眼睛，严密地监视着海面。
    军舰沿着原定巡逻航线前进，一个个岛屿从军舰两侧迅速地向后移动。果然不出所料，瞭望员突然从舰首上传来了急促的喊声：
    “报告指挥台，左舷十五度发现敌舰五艘，向我接近！”
      “准备战斗！按原定航向前进！”分队指挥员一面下达命令，一面举起望远镜仔细地观察蒋贼军舰的动向。
    军舰同指挥舰迅速由巡逻队形变成战斗队形，水兵们立即进入了各自的战斗岗位。这时五艘蒋贼军舰编成单纵队以高速度向我接近。敌我距离很快地缩短了。不一会，蒋贼军舰上便闪出了炮弹出口的火光。
    我军军舰从敌人炮弹所激起的水柱中驶出来，继续前进。蒋贼军以为我舰避战，越加疯狂起来，它们丢掉后面的两艘低速舰，一面射击、一面继续以高速度向我接近。我军机智、沉着的水兵们，抑制着心坎里的兴奋，暗暗地想道：“猪猡，笨蛋，上钩啦！”
    指挥台上的舰长和指挥舰上的分队指挥员，一面指挥战斗，一面观察蒋贼军舰的活动和在我舰周围爆炸的炮弹的散布状况。从无数次的海战中，水兵们已经熟悉了指挥员的脾气：在每次海战中，分队指挥员总是积极寻找一切可能打击敌人的战机。特别是在敌众我寡的情况下，更加显示出他的机智、灵活、沉着、果断的指挥才能。所以每当谈起分队指挥员时，水兵们总是自豪而赞许地说：“我们有了能指挥自己、又能指挥敌人的分队指挥员，胜利永远是属于我们的！”
    蒋贼军舰疯狂地发射着炮弹、迅速地靠近我军的军舰了。主炮瞄准手严保福和他的战友们，把所有的炮口都瞄准了敌舰，等待着开炮的命令。
      “左满舵，航向四十五度，准备射击！”舰长的命令刚一下达，严保福和他的炮手们便飞快地将炮旋转过来，炮口像磁铁一样紧跟着敌舰转动。这时，五艘蒋贼军舰全部出现在严保福的瞄准镜里，距离只不过××链（一链等于十浬）。水兵们高兴极了：这是多好的决战距离呀！蒋贼军舰恰好成一路纵队斜对着我舰，敌人约有一半炮火失去作用，如果它的后主炮开炮，那就要自己敲碎自己的脑瓜。在敌舰的右面，则有许多礁石限制着它们的机动范围。
    正当水兵们在暗暗钦佩舰长所选择的良好战斗位置时，忽然舰长发出了宏亮的口令：
    “目标，敌一号舰，预备——放！”
    严保福“唰”的一声，将瞄准点迅速移向蒋贼一号军舰指挥台，全舰炮火在同一时间内吐出了无数条火舌。这时，我指挥舰的猛烈炮火也从另一个角度射向敌人的一号舰。顿时，蒋贼一号舰周围升起了无数水柱。紧接着，我舰第二个齐放又打了过去。蒋贼一号舰被我炮弹包围住了。
    “快放！”舰长宏亮的口令还没消失，一群群的炮弹连续飞到蒋贼一号舰的横断面爆炸了，敌舰驾驶台附近立即冒起一股股浓烟。
    “命中敌舰啦！”严保福差点笑出声来，但是，他知道在这决定的时刻，多打一发炮弹，就多一分胜利，打的越快，敌人越还不了手。于是，他竭力屏住呼吸，瞄准点一秒钟也不离开蒋贼一号舰。炮火更猛了，只见我军舰上每门大炮的炮身都一刻不停地急促地伸缩着，连珠般的炮弹像火红的铁球，从两个角度飞向蒋贼一号舰。蒋贼一号舰的炮火全被打成哑巴了。严保福从瞄准镜里看到蒋贼一号舰向左倾斜过来，不断地做着三百六十度的转向，他又好气又好笑地说：“敌舰又要狗熊啦！”正当敌舰企图转向逃走时，我军军舰上的炮火又接连不断地打了过去。
    海战激烈地进行着，水兵们都想要看一看敌舰挨打的熊相。机舱内的战士都这样想：现在要是出去看看多好呀！操舵员只要转一转头就可透过窗户看到一切。但这不能，这会影响航角的稳定，这会妨碍炮火的射击。在这种情况下，只要有一个人稍一疏忽，炮火就会失去准确性，全盘战斗就可能被他一人带来失败。所以，水兵们压制住那种强烈的欲望，继续谨慎而又熟练地操纵着自己掌管的机械，炮打的越猛，对自己的机械检查的越周密，这样保证了全舰各种复杂的机械达到了高度的协同和统一，保证了炮火不间断地准确地打击敌人。
    蒋贼军为了掩护被我军击伤的一号舰逃走，又把二号舰开了上来。随着枪炮长的命令，我舰炮手们又迅速地将蒋贼二号舰扣在瞄准镜里，一个“快放”后，蒋贼二号舰的甲板上烈火一闪，升起了一股股的黑烟。我军军舰上发射的炮弹，继续飞向敌舰上爆炸着。
    我军军舰正在扩大战果的时候，突然下起大雨。在浓雾笼罩之下，蒋贼军舰慌张地转舵逃窜了。战斗警报一解除，我军军舰上的水兵们都兴奋地谈着、笑着、唱着、跳着，互相祝贺着这次海战的胜利。
    海战胜利地结束了。我人民海军英勇的某舰和指挥舰继续按照原定的巡逻线航进，警惕地保卫着祖国可爱的海洋。
