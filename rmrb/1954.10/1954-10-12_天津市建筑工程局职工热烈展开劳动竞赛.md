The broad masses of workers in various companies under the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, after completing flood prevention work, continued to launch labor competitions starting in September. More than eighty construction site worker groups participating in the competition have formulated or revised their group plans, and are engaged in challenging and responding to challenges. They are working hard to complete all of this year's engineering tasks.

In the competition, the workers' enthusiasm for production has soared, and labor productivity has increased. Many worker groups actively use advanced tools, promote advanced experience, and improve labor organization and operating methods, breaking through new labor quotas. Currently, in a dozen or so types of work, the work efficiency of bricklayers, steelworkers, concrete workers, and seven or eight other types of work can frequently reach or exceed the new quotas. Due to the increase in labor productivity, the progress of projects has accelerated compared to the past. For example, the Third Engineering Team of the Tanggu Construction Company was affected by flood prevention work in August and only completed 93 percent of the monthly plan. In September, the team's workers not only made up for the shortfall in August during the competition, but also completed the entire month's plan four and a half days ahead of schedule. The No. 225 construction site of the Second Construction Company completed 73 percent of the entire month's task in the first half of September.

In the competition, many groups stipulated specific methods for ensuring quality in their plans. The leadership of many construction sites also provided technical briefings to workers and implemented operating procedures. In September, the bureau's companies did not experience any major quality accidents, and rework waste was relatively reduced. During the competition, most construction sites were able to handle the rationalization proposals put forward by workers in a relatively timely manner, and some have been studied and adopted. At the same time, functional groups at each construction site paid attention to coordination. Some material personnel took the initiative to contact relevant departments to ensure timely supply of materials.

    天津市建筑工程局职工热烈展开劳动竞赛
      天津市建筑工程局所属各公司广大职工，在结束了防汛工作之后，从九月份开始继续展开劳动竞赛。参加竞赛的八十多个工地的工人小组都制订或修订了小组计划，展开挑战和应战。他们正努力完成今年全部的工程任务。
    在竞赛中，工人的生产热情高涨，劳动生产率提高。许多工人小组积极使用先进工具，推广先进经验，改进劳动组织和操作方法，突破了新的劳动定额。目前在十几个工种中，已有瓦工、钢筋工、混凝土工等七、八个工种的工作效率能经常达到或超过新定额。由于劳动生产率的提高，工程进度已较前加快。如塘沽建筑公司第三工程队八月份因受防汛工作影响，只完成当月计划的百分之九十三，九月份该工程队职工在竞赛中不仅补上了八月份的差额，而且提前四天半完成了全月计划。第二建筑公司二二五工地九月上半月就完成了全月任务的百分之七十三。
    在竞赛中，许多小组在计划中规定了保证质量的具体办法。不少工地的领导方面并对工人进行了技术交底，贯彻了操作规程。该局各公司在九月份未发生重大质量事故，返工浪费现象也相对减少。竞赛中，大部工地能够比较及时地处理职工所提出的合理化建议，有些已研究采纳。同时，各工地职能组之间注意配合，有些材料人员主动与有关部门联系，保证及时供料。
