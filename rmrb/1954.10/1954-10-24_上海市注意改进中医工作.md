    Shanghai Pays Attention to Improving Traditional Chinese Medicine Work
    Shanghai's more than 2,600 traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners have made considerable contributions to medical and health work in the past five years. Their unity and cooperation with Western medicine have also gradually strengthened. By the end of August this year, more than 600 TCM practitioners had participated in the work of 69 joint Chinese-Western medicine clinics and TCM joint clinics. Many TCM practitioners have also participated in factory healthcare and TCM clinics for publicly funded medical care. Since August this year, Shanghai has established the first TCM clinical research institution - the Municipal No. 11 People's Hospital and a Municipal TCM Outpatient Department. Huadong Hospital and Guangci Hospital have also established TCM departments one after another, and many TCM practitioners have actively participated.
    The political awareness and professional level of TCM practitioners have also improved significantly. After the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Shanghai Municipal Association of Health Workers in 1952, TCM practitioners in the city carried out political and professional studies in a guided and organized manner. Through the aforementioned organizations, they enhanced the unity between Chinese and Western medicine, initially exchanged Chinese and Western medical theories, and compiled some TCM experience. 70% of the city's TCM practitioners have undergone refresher courses, 500-600 TCM practitioners have attended various academic lectures, and more than 300 people have participated in TCM medical review courses, studying courses such as materia medica, diagnostics, Treatise on Febrile Diseases, Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber, acupuncture, and TCM internal medicine and surgery. In 1952, the TCM and Chinese medicine circles spent half a year studying and compiling the inherent formulas of Chinese medicine. This year, more than 100 people in the TCM and Chinese medicine circles studied the first draft of the Chinese medicine empirical formulas compiled by the Ministry of Health and provided many opinions.
    However, due to the lack of deep understanding of the policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine by the health departments and the lack of attention to TCM, the potential power of the vast number of TCM practitioners in Shanghai has not been fully brought into play. In the TCM refresher courses, the focus was solely on teaching modern medical courses, neglecting the improvement of TCM academics. Recently, Shanghai held a representative conference of TCM practitioners, and the relevant leaders conducted self-criticism at the meeting. Through the meeting, they unified their thinking and clarified the direction of future work, which prepared important conditions for improving TCM work. (Zhang Chao)

    上海市注意改进中医工作
    上海市二千六百多名中医师，在五年来的医疗卫生工作中有不少贡献。他们同西医的团结合作也逐步增强，到今年八月底止，已有六百多名中医师参加了六十九所中西医联合诊所和中医联合诊所的工作，并有不少中医师参加了工厂医疗保健和公费医疗中医门诊所的工作。今年八月以来，上海市成立了第一个中医临床研究机构——市立第十一人民医院和一个市立中医门诊部。华东医院及广慈医院亦先后设立了中医科，许多中医师都踊跃参加。
    中医师的政治觉悟和业务水平也有显著提高。一九五二年成立上海市中医学会和上海市卫生工作者协会后，全市中医师即有领导、有组织地展开了政治和业务学习，并通过前述各种组织，增强了中西医之间的团结，初步交流了中西医学理，整理了一些中医中药经验。全市百分之七十的中医师经过了进修班的学习，有五、六百名中医师听过各种学术讲座，有三百多人参加了中医医学温课班，学习了药物、诊断、伤寒论、金匮要略、针灸学及中医内科、外科等课程。一九五二年，中医中药界曾经过半年时间研究整理了国药固有成方，今年又有中医中药界一百多人研究了卫生部辑成的中药经验方初稿，提供了许多意见。
    但是，由于卫生部门对团结中西医政策体会不深，对中医中药重视不够，上海广大中医的潜在力量还没有充分发挥出来。在中医进修班中，单纯讲授现代医学课程，忽视了中医学术的提高。最近上海市召开了中医代表会议，有关领导方面在会上进行了自我批评。通过会议统一了思想认识，明确了今后工作的努力方向，为改进中医工作准备了重要条件。　（张　潮）
