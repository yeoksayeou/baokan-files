When talking about her visit to the prayer halls of Buddhist students, she said, "They have full freedom of religious belief." In her speech, Mrs. Nehru also pointed out the important role of the Chinese and Indian people in safeguarding Asian peace.

Sha Ku. Mukherjee, a member of the Legislative Assembly of West Bengal, India, said that the mass parade on National Day showed the Chinese people's determination to demand peace. The 500,000-strong contingent, with people from all walks of life participating, was enthusiastic, joyful, and colorful.
