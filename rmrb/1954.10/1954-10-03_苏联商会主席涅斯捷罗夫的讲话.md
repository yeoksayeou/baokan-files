Dear friends, comrades!

    As the Chinese people celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with extremely high political and labor enthusiasm, the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction opens.

    The Soviet people, linked with the Chinese people by an unbreakable, fraternal, and profound friendship, feel extremely happy about the tremendous achievements that the People's Republic of China has made in political, economic, and cultural construction over the past five years.

    The great friendship and increasingly extensive cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, which are becoming more and more consolidated, are fully expressed in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance concluded on February 14, 1950. This treaty is the unshakable foundation for all-round political, economic and cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

    In accordance with this treaty, and in order to develop it, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have signed various economic agreements guaranteeing the great development of trade between the two countries.

    The trade relations between our two countries are established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, with the aim of providing each other with comprehensive fraternal assistance in economic construction. Our two countries supply each other with large quantities of various goods. In order to realize the economic construction plan of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union supplies China with the latest machinery and other equipment.

    At this exhibition, everyone can see various machines, measuring tools, various industrial products and agricultural products, as well as literary and artistic works. We want to introduce, through this exhibition, the achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology, in industry and socialist agriculture. At the same time, the exhibition will also introduce the achievements of the Soviet Union in national education and health.

    We hope that this exhibition will help the Chinese people understand the experience of the Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction, and help the Chinese people use this experience to successfully realize the economic construction tasks of the People's Republic of China for the happiness of the motherland.

    Today, at the opening of the exhibition, we would like to express our gratitude to the Chinese government and the leading figures of various Chinese organizations and groups directly involved in the construction of the exhibition hall, for their help and assistance in this great undertaking. At the same time, we must also express our heartfelt gratitude to the outstanding Chinese working class, because their representatives, with the help of Soviet and Chinese architects and engineers, built this building.

    I wish the all-round cooperation between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China will become more and more consolidated and developed.

    Now please allow me to declare the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction officially open.

    苏联商会主席涅斯捷罗夫的讲话亲爱的朋友们，同志们！
    当中国人民以极为高涨的政治和劳动热情来庆祝中华人民共和国国庆五周年的时候，苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会开幕了。
    以牢不可破的兄弟般的深厚友谊同中国人民联结在一起的苏联人民，对于中华人民共和国五年来在政治、经济及文化建设中所获得的巨大成就，感到极大的愉快。
    中苏两国人民间日益巩固的伟大友谊和日益广泛发展的合作，在一九五○年二月十四日缔结的中苏友好同盟互助条约中得到了充分的表现。这一条约是苏联与中华人民共和国之间全面的政治、经济、文化合作的不可动摇的基础。
    根据这一条约，并为了发展这一条约，苏联与中华人民共和国签订了保证中苏两国贸易大大发展的各项经济协定。
    我们两国之间的贸易关系是在平等互利的基础上建立起来的，其目的在于在经济建设事业中互相给予全面的兄弟般的援助。我们两国互相大量供给各种货物。为了实现中华人民共和国经济建设的计划，苏联供给中国以最新的机器设备和其他机械。
    在这个展览会上，大家可以看到各种机器、量具、各种工业产品和农业产品以及文学艺术作品等。我们想通过这个展览会来介绍苏联在科学和技术方面、在工业和社会主义农业方面的成就。同时，展览会上也要介绍苏联在国民教育和卫生方面的成就。
    我们希望，这个展览会将会有助于中国人民了解苏联在经济和文化建设上的经验，并帮助中国人民利用这些经验来为祖国的幸福而顺利地实现中华人民共和国的经济建设任务。
    今天，在展览会开幕的时候，我们谨向中国政府和直接参加建筑展览馆的中国各机关团体的领导方面表示感谢，感谢他们对于这一巨大事业所给予的帮助和协助。同时，我们也不能不对中国的卓越的工人阶级表示衷心的感谢，因为他们的代表者们在苏联和中国建筑师与工程师的帮助下，修建成了这一建筑物。
    祝苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟与中华人民共和国之间全面的合作日益巩固和发展。
    现在请允许我宣布苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会正式开幕。
