    Improve the Utilization of Urban Feces
    Recently, many readers have written letters suggesting improvements in the utilization of urban feces. Reader Chen Shujun wrote that farmers in the suburbs of Beijing have the habit of sun-drying feces for fertilizer. Some sun-drying yards are set up along roads in urban and rural areas, which not only affects urban environmental sanitation but also reduces the effectiveness of the fertilizer. This must be improved.
    According to our understanding, the practice of sun-drying feces for fertilizer is a bad method. According to the analysis results of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, after human feces are sun-dried into dried manure, the fertilizer content (mainly nitrogen) is lost by about 40% to 60%. According to the results of the dried manure produced by the Beijing Analysis and Hygiene Engineering Bureau, it is also proved that the fertilizer content is lost by about 50%, which is very unfavorable for agricultural production. As for setting up sun-drying yards by the roadside, it will inevitably cause flies to breed, foul odors to spread, and hinder urban environmental sanitation. Therefore, it is indeed very necessary to educate farmers to change this habit.
    In recent years, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry has continuously promoted the rational application and storage methods of human excrement to farmers in conjunction with the improvement of cultivation techniques, and has achieved some results. However, farmers have not completely changed their habit of sun-drying feces. In order to change the habits of farmers in the suburbs and use manure scientifically, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry has decided that in addition to continuing to mobilize farmers to directly use diluted manure, use fresh manure mixed with soil for their own use, or compost, it also proposes to mix human urine with straw or garbage, and adopt the high-temperature rapid composting method introduced by the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute to make compost for utilization, in order to give full play to the effectiveness of fertilizer and kill pests and diseases in the fertilizer (for specific methods, see "Agricultural Science Newsletter" Issue 12, 1953). In addition, according to the increasing use of diluted manure by farmers (especially vegetable farmers) in the suburbs of Beijing, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry suggested that the Sanitation Engineering Bureau consider signing contracts with agricultural production cooperatives, so that diluted manure in the city will no longer pass through the manure yard but will be directly sent to the agricultural production cooperatives. The Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry has also notified relevant units to find ways to relocate or take effective measures to improve sanitation for individual manure yards set up on the side of the city roads. These practices of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry are correct, and places with similar situations should follow the methods of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry to make reasonable improvements.

### 改善对城市粪便的利用情况

专栏：读者来信摘要

    改善对城市粪便的利用情况
    近来，有不少读者来信建议改善对城市粪便的利用情况。读者陈淑筠来信中说，北京市郊区农民有晒制粪干作肥料的习惯，个别晒粪场设置在城厢沿马路的地方，不但影响城市环境卫生，而且还会使肥料效果受到损失，必须加以改进。
    据我们了解，晒制粪干作肥料的做法，是一种不好的办法。根据华北农业科学研究所化验结果，人粪晒制成粪干后，肥分（主要是氮素）损失约百分之四十至六十。另据北京市分析卫生工程局晒制的粪干结果，也证明肥分损失在百分之五十左右，对于农业生产大为不利。至于在路旁设置晒粪场，势必引起苍蝇繁殖，臭气四散，妨碍城市环境卫生。因此，教育农民改变这种习惯，确是十分必要的。
    近年来北京市农林局曾结合耕作技术的改进，不断向农民宣传有关人粪尿的合理施用和贮存方法，已经取得了一些成效。但是农民对于晒制粪干的这一习惯还没有完全改变。为了改变市郊农民的习惯，科学地使用粪便，北京市农林局决定除了继续动员农民直接使用粪稀、自用鲜粪拌土调制或沤制堆肥外，并提倡以人粪尿掺入藁杆或垃圾，采取华北农业科学研究所介绍的高温速成堆肥的方法制成堆肥来利用，以充分发挥肥料效能和杀灭肥料中的病虫（具体办法见“农业科学通讯”一九五三年十二期）。此外，根据北京市郊区农民（尤其是菜农）使用粪稀的已逐渐增多的情况，北京市农林局建议卫生工程局考虑和农业生产合作社订立合同，城内粪稀不再经过粪场而就直接送到农业生产合作社。对个别设置在城厢路旁的粪场，农林局也已通知有关单位设法迁移或采取有效办法来改善卫生情况。 北京市农林局这些做法是正确的，凡有类似情况的地方，应该仿效北京市农林局的办法，作出合理的改进。
