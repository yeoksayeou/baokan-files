    Looking at Higher Education in the Soviet Union from the Soviet Exhibition
    Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of Higher Education

    Anyone who has visited the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction will not forget the magnificent architecture of the new Moscow University building. Upon entering the Higher Education Hall, one immediately sees the model of the main buildings of Moscow University placed in the center of the hall, which is so fascinating. This largest and most well-equipped university in the world has over a thousand classrooms and laboratories for teaching and research, far exceeding any university in capitalist countries. These laboratories are equipped with the latest scientific equipment, allowing students to learn in the best environment.

    From the perspective of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we should not stop at admiring the attractive new architecture of Moscow University, but should further understand the grand scale of Soviet higher education and its development process, using it as a mirror for our own country. On the front wall of the Higher Education Hall, there are a few simple but meaningful statistics. From these figures, we know that in 1913 before the revolution, Tsarist Russia had only ninety-six institutions of higher learning in nineteen cities. At that time, there were only six thousand seven hundred university professors and teachers, and one hundred and twenty-two thousand students. In 1953, the Soviet Union had eight hundred and twenty-seven institutions of higher learning in two hundred and seventy cities. The number of university professors and teachers increased to eighty-two thousand, and the number of students reached one million five hundred and thirty thousand, about twelve times more than in 1913. What is particularly noteworthy here is that the Soviet Union is much more economical in its use of teaching staff than we are; while the number of teachers has certainly increased rapidly, fully utilizing the potential of each teacher is an important factor in the rapid growth of higher education. The wide distribution of schools and the special attention given to minority areas are also important aspects that we must strive to learn. Below the statistics on the wall is a large map of the Soviet Union, dotted with dazzling red stars like a chessboard, indicating that two hundred and seventy cities have institutions of higher learning. While these are mainly concentrated in the European part, they also include cities in the Far East and Central Asia. National minorities also have their own universities, and the standards are quite high. This is a great success of the Soviet Communist Party's ethnic policy, which embodies the selfless assistance of the Russian nation to the domestic minority nationalities.

    What is particularly commendable is that Soviet higher education has developed greatly compared to 1940. Another line of figures on the wall points out that in 1954, the Soviet Union's state budget allocated a total of 67.1 billion rubles for popularizing education, training cadres, developing science and art, and other educational measures, about three times the amount used for the same purpose in 1940. During the same period, the number of students in institutions of higher learning almost doubled (it was 812,000 in 1940). During this period, the Soviet Union went through the Patriotic War, and the national economy was greatly damaged, but the strength of the socialist country and the speed of its recovery were truly unexpected. At the same time, this situation is enough to prove that the Soviet people are carrying out peaceful construction with all their strength. From these figures, people can also see that before 1940, Soviet higher education was developing steadily; afterwards, with the surge of the economy, Soviet higher education has developed more rapidly. We must grasp this point in order to avoid the tendency of impetuosity and rash advance that may occur in the construction of higher education.

    In the process of the Soviet Union building communism, undoubtedly more new buildings like Moscow University will be built; but at present, most institutions of higher learning are not like this. In the higher education of the Soviet Union, a spirit of thrift is running through. Because only through increasing production and practicing economy in all aspects can we accumulate funds to rapidly industrialize the country, which creates the preconditions for building new buildings like Moscow University. This is different from the idea of some of our comrades who want to build many houses when they talk about running schools, which is a mentality of being fond of greatness and eager for success. But the Soviet Union's thrift is different from the general understanding of making do with whatever is available. They strive to spend less money, do more things, and do things well; they save as much money as they can, but they do not save money where it should not be saved. This is exactly what we should strive to learn. Soviet experts working in our education departments also often remind us of this, but we still do not pay enough attention to this aspect. For example, our institutions of higher learning have built a large number of school buildings since liberation, but many of them are either poorly designed or poorly built. In contrast, the school buildings of some famous Soviet institutions of higher learning (Leningrad University, Kiev University, Kazan University, and some engineering and medical colleges, etc.) in the pictures, although they do not appear too large, are mostly artistically constructed, becoming a beautiful learning environment. What is particularly noteworthy is that many pictures fully show that the scientific experimental equipment in Soviet institutions of higher learning and secondary technical schools is very abundant; the equipment in the laboratories and practice factories is placed very compactly to save space, and it is kept very clean, with all necessary safety measures. These are all things that we must step up our learning of.

    The use of models to improve teaching effectiveness is valued in the Soviet Union. In the Leningrad Veterinary College's cattle breeding experiment, small models of cattle are placed on the students' desks, so that students can study them while listening to the teacher's lectures. In the rolling mill technician school attached to the Kuznetsk Stalin Metallurgical Combine, students observe around the rolling mill equipment model during class. In the harbor laboratory of the Leningrad Water Transport Engineering College, there is a model of a ship. Production practice occupies an extremely important position in Soviet higher education. From the pictures, we can see that students of the Kiev Engineering College operate on lathes like workers when they practice in the Leningrad Stalin Factory; we can also see agricultural college students driving combine harvesters to harvest grain in the fields.

    Soviet students not only study well, but also live well. From the pictures, we can see them skiing, strolling along the Moscow River, performing opera and dance dramas, and a group of female students doing physical exercises.

    The Higher Education Hall in the Soviet Exhibition, although not very large in scale, is very rich in content, and there are many things worth learning from.

    从苏联展览会看苏联的高等教育
    高等教育部副部长　曾昭抡
    参观过苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的人，都忘不了莫斯科大学新校舍的宏伟建筑。一进高等教育馆，马上就看到在馆的中心摆着的莫斯科大学主要建筑物的模型，它是那样地引人入胜。这个全世界规模最大、设备最完善的大学，单单教室和作教学及研究用的实验室就有一千多间，远远超过任何资本主义国家的大学。在这些实验室里，装有各种最新式的科学设备，使学生能在最好的环境里学习。
    从学习苏联先进经验的角度来看，我们不应停止在景仰莫斯科大学那吸引人的新建筑，而应进一步了解苏联高等教育的宏大规模及其发展过程，以之作为我国的借镜。在高等教育馆的正面墙上，有几行简单的、但富有意义的统计数字。由这些数字，我们知道，在革命前的一九一三年，沙皇俄国在十九个城市只设立九十六所高等学校，当时大学教授和教员总数不过六千七百人，学生十二万二千人；一九五三年，苏联在二百七十个城市共设立了八百二十七所高等学校，大学教授及教员增至八万二千人，学生人数达到一百五十三万人，比一九一三年时约增加了十二倍。这里特别值得注意的，是苏联对于教学人员的使用，比我们要经济得多；教师的数目固然增加得很快，但是充分发挥每个教师的潜力，乃是高等教育得以迅速增长的一个重要因素。学校分布地区之广、以及特别照顾少数民族地区，也是我们所必须努力学习的一个重要方面。墙上统计数字下面，有一幅很大的苏联地图，上面像布棋一般地缀着耀眼的红星，表明二百七十个城市设有高等学校。这些虽然主要地密集在欧洲部分，但也包括一些远东和中亚细亚地方的城市。少数民族也有了自己的大学，而且水准都相当高。这是苏联共产党民族政策的伟大成功，它体现了俄罗斯民族对国内少数民族的无私帮助。
    难能可贵的是，同一九四○年相比，苏联的高等教育有了很大的发展。墙上的另一行数字指出，一九五四年苏联国家预算为普及教育、培养干部、发展科学和艺术以及其他教育措施所拨出的经费共达六百七十一亿卢布，约三倍于一九四○年用于同一目的的经费。在同一时期，高等学校的学生人数几乎增加了一倍（在一九四○年时为八十一万二千人）。在这期间，苏联经过卫国战争，国民经济一度受到很大的破坏，而社会主义国家力量之伟大，恢复之迅速，真是出人意料之外。同时这种情形，也足以证明苏联人民是在以全力进行和平建设。从这些数字，人们还可以看到，一九四○年以前苏联高等教育是以稳步前进的姿态发展的；以后随着经济的高涨，苏联高等教育有了更迅速的发展。我们必须掌握这点，方能避免高等教育事业建设中可能发生的急躁冒进的偏向。
    在苏联建设共产主义事业的进程中，无疑地将有更多的类似莫斯科大学的新建筑建立起来；但在目前，一般高等学校还不是这样。在苏联的高等教育事业中，贯穿着一种节约的精神。因为只有通过各方面的增产节约，才能积累资金，使国家迅速地工业化起来，这样也就为盖起莫斯科大学这样的新建筑创造先决条件。这和我们有些同志一讲到办学校就要盖许多房子那种好大喜功的想法是不同的。但是苏联的节约，同一般人所了解的因陋就简，又有所不同。他们是争取少用钱、多办事、办好事；当省的钱尽量省，不当省的钱则不省。这正是我们应当努力学习的地方。在我国教育部门工作的苏联专家也经常提醒我们这件事，而我们则至今在这方面注意得还不够。比方说，我国的高等学校，在解放后修建了大量的校舍，但其中许多不是设计不好，就是盖得不好。与此相对比，图片中一些有名的苏联高等学校（列宁格勒大学、基辅大学、喀山大学和一些工学院、医学院等）的校舍，虽然并不显得太大，但是建筑大都是艺术化的，成为一个优美的学习环境。特别值得注意的，是许多图片充分表现出苏联高等学校及中等技术学校的科学实验设备非常充实；实验室和实习工厂里设备摆得很紧凑，以节省地方，同时保持得很清洁，并有一切必要的安全措施。这些都是我们所必须加紧学习的。
    利用模型来提高教学效果，在苏联受到重视。在列宁格勒兽医学院的牛种实验里，一条条牛的小模型，放在学生面前的书桌上，学生们可以一面听教师讲课、一面研究。在库兹湼茨斯大林冶金联合工厂附设的轧钢技师学校，上课时学生围着轧钢设备模型进行观察。在列宁格勒水运工程学院的港湾研究室，有一只船的模型。生产实习，在苏联高等教育中占有极重要的地位。从图片可以看到基辅工学院的学生在列宁格勒斯大林工厂实习的时候，像工人一般在车床上操作；也看到农学院的学生驾着联合收割机在田中收割谷物。
    苏联学生不但学习好，生活得也很好。从图片中，我们可以看到他们在滑雪，在莫斯科河畔散步，在演出歌舞剧，还看到一班女同学在进行体育锻炼。
    苏联展览会中的高等教育馆，规模虽然并不很大，内容却非常丰富，有很多东西值得我们学习。
