    German Experts Helping Our Country Build Sugar Refineries
    On the construction site of the North China Sugar Refinery, there is a group of experts from the German Democratic Republic. Led by Comrade Wolff, the four experts, carrying the friendship of the German people, traveled across thousands of mountains and rivers from the banks of the Elbe to the shores of the Yellow River in our country, helping the Chinese people build a happy new life. The North China Sugar Refinery is a factory equipped with the latest technology, and all the machines are made by our fraternal workers in the German Democratic Republic. From factory design and construction to machine installation, it has all been carried out with the enthusiastic help of German friends. Five months ago, when construction had not yet started, the government of the German Democratic Republic sent experts Wolff and Kretschmer to our country to assist in the deployment of the construction. Later, the German Democratic Republic sent boiler expert Comrade Müller and electrical expert Comrade Tschumuski. In their work, the experts impart advanced technology to our technicians and workers. Their serious and responsible spirit in their work has deeply moved our employees. They take everything into consideration to ensure that the factory is built well and economically. The experts suggested adding waste silk drying equipment so that a large amount of waste silk can be used as high-quality livestock feed and reduce the cost of sugar. On the issue of heating during winter construction, the experts put forward a more economical method based on the actual situation. The experts said: We should think of saving on everything and use the valuable property of the Chinese people where it is more needed and more valuable. The experts are all honored to be personally helping the Chinese people carry out industrial construction and enhance the strength to defend peace. Expert Comrade Kretschmer said: "China has abundant products and a large population, and such good people—hardworking, intelligent, and unafraid of difficulties. The people of China and Germany are working hard to build their own countries. The people of the two countries help each other, so that we can better defend world peace and live a happier life."

    帮助我国建设糖厂的德国专家
    在华北糖厂工地上，有一个德意志民主共和国的专家组。以沃尔夫同志为首的四位专家，带着德国人民的友谊，从易北河畔越过千山万水来到我国黄河之滨，帮助中国人民建设幸福的新生活。华北糖厂是一座以最新技术装备起来的工厂，全部机器都是民主德国工人兄弟制造的。从工厂设计、施工到机器安装，也都是在德国友人热忱帮助下进行的。在五个月以前，当工地还没有开工的时候，德意志民主共和国政府就派专家沃尔夫和克雷希莫同志来我国协助部署施工，以后，德意志民主共和国又派来了锅炉专家缪勒同志和电气专家邱木斯基同志。在工作中，专家把先进技术传授给我国技术人员和工人。他们对工作认真负责的精神，使我国职工深受感动。他们处处考虑到工厂要建筑得好，还要节约。专家曾建议增加废丝干燥设备，这样就可以利用大量废丝作为上等的牲畜饲料，还可减低糖的成本。在冬季施工采暖问题上，专家根据实际情况，提出了比较节省的办法。专家说：我们应该在每件事上想法节省一些，把中国人民珍贵的财产用在更需要、更有价值的地方。专家们都为自己亲身帮助中国人民进行工业建设、增强保卫和平力量而感到光荣。专家克雷希莫同志说：“中国有丰富的物产，众多的人民，而且是这样好的人民——勤劳、智慧、不怕困难。中德两国人民都在努力建设自己的祖国，两国的人民互相帮助，这样，我们就能更好地保卫世界和平，过更幸福的生活。”
