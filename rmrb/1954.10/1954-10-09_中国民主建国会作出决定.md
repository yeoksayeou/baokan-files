Xinhua News Agency, October 7th:

    The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on October 4th to discuss how to organize ACFIC members to study the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the important reports of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, and to implement them in conjunction with the members' own businesses. The meeting was chaired by Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Standing Committee. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including members of the Standing Committee, members of the General Committee in Beijing, and ACFIC members who were delegates to the First National People's Congress.

    In their speeches at the meeting, some participants explained the education they had received at the National People's Congress, especially after studying Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution and Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government. They had a clearer understanding of the state's current policy towards the national bourgeoisie and the future prospects of the national bourgeoisie. Many also mentioned that they should take the lead in guiding the industrial and commercial sectors to love the country and abide by the law, and actively accept socialist transformation. The meeting finally decided that the General Office would issue a circular to local organizations, requiring them to organize members to study the Constitution and the important reports of the First Session of the National People's Congress, and to strive to implement them in action.

    After the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee, the attendees were divided into five groups to hold seminars on October 5th to discuss how to further strengthen patriotic and law-abiding education among members, how to further assist the government in promoting state capitalism, how to strengthen the cultivation and improvement of the ACFIC's industrial and commercial members, and how to give play to their backbone role in the industrial and commercial sectors, and how to strengthen the organizational work of the ACFIC accordingly in order to actively abide by the Constitution and implement the resolutions of the First Session of the First National People's Congress. The speakers in each group were very enthusiastic in their discussions, and most were able to analyze the situation in light of reality, or conduct self-examination in conjunction with their own understanding. The seminars also put forward some useful criticisms and suggestions for the work of the ACFIC. The ACFIC General Office has decided to compile the opinions put forward by each group in the seminars and submit them to the Standing Committee for study and handling.

    中国民主建国会作出决定
   【新华社七日讯】中国民主建国会总会在十月四日举行常务委员会扩大会议，讨论如何组织民主建国会会员学习中华人民共和国宪法及第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的重要报告，并结合会员自己的业务加以贯彻。会议由常务委员会主任委员黄炎培主持。出席这次会议的有常务委员会委员、在京的总会委员会委员和第一届全国人民代表大会代表中的民主建国会会员，共一百多人。
    会议发言中，有的说明了自己在这次全国人民代表大会会议中所受到的教育，特别是学习了刘少奇委员长关于宪法草案的报告和周恩来总理关于政府工作报告，对于国家现在对民族资产阶级的政策和民族资产阶级将来的前途有了更明确的认识。不少人还提到自己要以身作则地带动工商界爱国守法，积极接受社会主义改造。会议最后决定由总会发出通函给各地方组织，要求组织会员学习宪法和全国人民代表大会第一次会议的重要报告，并在行动中努力贯彻。
    常务委员会扩大会议结束后，到会人员又分为五个小组在十月五日举行座谈会，讨论了为积极遵守宪法，贯彻第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的各项决议，应如何在会员中进一步加强爱国守法教育工作，以及如何进一步协助政府推进国家资本主义工作，如何加强培养和提高民主建国会的工商业者会员，发挥他们在工商界中的骨干作用，和如何相应地加强民主建国会的组织工作。各小组在座谈中发言非常踊跃，大部分并能联系实际进行分析，或者结合自己的认识，进行检讨。座谈会对民主建国会的工作也提出了一些有益的批评和建议。民主建国会总会已决定把各小组在座谈中提出的意见加以整理后交由常务委员会研究处理。
