    At a conference of trade union cadres from state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Beijing on the 18th, the chairmen of the trade unions of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Beijing People's Printing Plant, on behalf of all workers in the three factories, jointly presented a letter of suggestion to all factories and mines in the city, proposing to launch an inter-factory labor competition citywide in the fourth quarter to fully complete and strive to over fulfill this year's industrial and capital construction plans for the capital, and to prepare conditions for the implementation of the 1955 plan.

    The letter of suggestion proposed that total output value, output and quality of major products, cost, and labor productivity be used as common conditions for the competition. The competition conditions and indicators announced by the three factories are: Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant guarantees to complete the planned total output value and pig iron production in the fourth quarter, and strives to exceed both by 3%; Shijingshan Power Plant strives to exceed the planned total output value by 1.52% and the planned power generation by 1.2%; Beijing People's Printing Plant strives to exceed the planned total output value by 2.23%.

    Prior to this, the workers of the three factories had inspected the production situation in the first three quarters and carried out preparations for further developing the competition. From October 14th to 17th, the three factories separately convened worker congresses, worker representative meetings, factory-wide production meetings, and meetings of production activists to discuss the key issues in current production and formulate measures to guarantee the realization of the competition conditions. The key to completing the production plan at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is to avoid equipment accidents. The technical innovation group led by Hou Decheng, blast furnace shift foreman and labor model, is studying seven technical improvement tasks for equipment to ensure smooth furnace operation, increase output, and reduce costs. The workers of the boiler workshop of Shijingshan Power Plant held a technical meeting on the 16th to specifically study how to ensure safe operation.

    The suggestion of the workers of the three factories has attracted the attention of various leading organs in Beijing. Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, read out at the meeting the appeal issued by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions based on this letter of suggestion, calling for the launch of a labor competition throughout the city. Jia Tingsan, Minister of the Industry Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, stated in his speech that the inter-factory labor competition is of great significance for comprehensively over fulfilling the production plan for the fourth quarter and this year and for preparing for next year's production. He encouraged workers throughout the city to improve various production tasks in the competition to ensure the speed of national industrialization.

    Based on the suggestions of the workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Beijing People's Printing Plant, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions issued an appeal on the 18th to launch an inter-factory labor competition throughout the city.

    The appeal of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions stated that we fully agree with and support the suggestion of all workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Beijing People's Printing Plant to launch an inter-factory labor competition in the fourth quarter for all state-owned and local state-owned factory and mine workers in the city. We call on workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines throughout the city to actively participate in this competition, and to do the following work in the competition:

    First, formulate concise and specific competition conditions according to the requirements of the national plan, and check and revise them regularly to ensure their realization.

    Second, correctly carry out the technical innovation movement, learn and promote advanced experience, and put forward rationalization proposals around key production issues. Veteran skilled workers and technical personnel should play a backbone role in this work, and should lead and help young workers learn technology and rapidly improve their technical level.

    Third, actively participate in production meetings, carry out criticism and self-criticism, consolidate labor discipline, conscientiously study and implement technical operating procedures and safety procedures, make suggestions for improving administrative work, and play a supervisory and guaranteeing role in enterprise management.

    The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions also called on functional departments and management personnel to further strengthen the inspection of plan completion, strengthen technical leadership and planning work, scientifically organize labor, propose topics on a monthly basis, organize rationalization proposals in a guided manner, improve the management level of enterprises, and ensure the in-depth development of the labor competition. It called on labor models and advanced producers to play a backbone, leading, and bridging role, actively and rapidly mobilizing all workers to study and formulate competition conditions and participate in inter-factory competition.

    The appeal of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions stated that as long as all workers in the city unite, encourage and help each other, and give full play to the infinite creative talent of the working class, the inter-factory competition in the fourth quarter will surely achieve significant results, and the national plan will surely be successfully completed.

    北京市总工会接受石景山钢铁厂等三厂职工建议
    号召全市职工开展厂际劳动竞赛
    石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂和北京人民印刷厂的工会主席，十八日在北京市国营和地方国营厂矿企业工会干部会议上，代表三个厂全体职工联合向全市厂矿提出了一封建议书，建议第四季度在全市范围内展开厂际劳动竞赛，以全面完成并争取超额完成今年首都的工业和基本建设计划，并为执行一九五五年的计划准备条件。
    建议书中提出以总产值、主要产品的产量和质量、成本和劳动生产率作为竞赛的共同条件。这三个厂宣布的竞赛条件和各项指标是：石景山钢铁厂保证在第四季度完成生产总值和生铁产量的计划，并争取都超额百分之三；石景山发电厂争取生产总值计划超额百分之一点五二，发电量计划超额百分之一点二；北京人民印刷厂争取生产总值计划超额百分之二点二三。
    在此以前，三个厂的职工都检查了前三季的生产情况，进行了进一步开展竞赛的准备工作。十月十四日到十七日，三个工厂分别召开了职工大会、职工代表会议、全厂生产会议和生产积极分子会议，讨论目前生产中的关键问题，制订出保证竞赛条件实现的措施计划。石景山钢铁厂完成生产计划的关键是不出设备事故，高炉值班工长、劳动模范侯德成领导的技术革新小组为了保证炉况顺行，提高产量，降低成本，正在研究七项改进设备的技术工作。石景山发电厂锅炉车间职工在十六日召开的技术会上，专门研究了如何保证安全运行的问题。
    三个厂职工的这一建议引起了北京市各领导机关的重视。北京市总工会副主席刘莱夫在会议上宣读了北京市总工会根据这一建议书发出的关于在全市范围内开展劳动竞赛的号召。中共北京市委员会工业部部长贾庭三在讲话中，说明厂际劳动竞赛对于全面超额完成第四季度和今年的生产计划并为明年生产作好准备工作有很大意义，他鼓励全市职工在竞赛中改进各项生产工作，保证国家工业化的速度。
