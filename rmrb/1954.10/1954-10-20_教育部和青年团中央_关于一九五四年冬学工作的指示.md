This winter, rural areas across the country need to carry out many urgent tasks, such as conducting widespread publicity and education on the Constitution of the People's Republic of China among the broad masses of peasants, further developing the agricultural production increase campaign centered on mutual assistance and cooperation, and continuing to do a good job in the state purchase and supply of grain, oil, and cotton cloth, and the state purchase of cotton. This year's winter school must first closely integrate with these work tasks and carry out political education among farmers, focusing on doing a good job in this area. On the other hand, in order to meet the needs of the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, we should also actively organize farmers to learn culture. All localities should follow this spirit and do a good job in this year's winter school work. For this purpose, the following instructions are given:

    I. Winter schools must earnestly conduct political education. Its main contents should be: First, carry out the publicity and education of the Constitution, which is to further carry out the education of the general task of the state in the transition period, so that farmers understand the great significance and main contents of the Constitution, and encourage and educate the peasant masses to abide by the Constitution and strive to ensure the implementation of the Constitution. Second, study the policy of agricultural mutual assistance and cooperation, and improve farmers' understanding of agricultural cooperation, so as to promote the development of the rural cooperative movement; study the policy of developing agricultural production on the basis of mutual assistance and cooperation, so that farmers understand the importance of increasing the production of grain, cotton, oil and other agricultural products, so as to ensure the increase of agricultural production. Third, study the policy of unified purchase and sales, so that farmers understand the principle of incorporating rural production and consumption into the national plan, obey the national plan, and sell surplus grain and other products to the state to support the industrial construction of the motherland. In addition, it is also necessary to carry out current affairs education and national defense education, publicize the need to liberate Taiwan, mobilize the replenishment of soldiers, oppose the US policy of aggression and war, and actively defend world peace, so as to improve the patriotism and internationalism of the peasant masses. All provinces (cities) should be responsible for compiling the above-mentioned political education materials in close combination with the actual local conditions and supply them in a timely manner.

    II. For the cultural education of this year's winter school, all localities should appropriately put forward the teaching requirements for one winter, such as learning a book or recognizing a certain number of characters in one winter, according to the length of the winter slack time and other conditions, in order to effectively achieve the purpose of gradually eliminating illiteracy. The literacy textbook can adopt the "Peasant Literacy Textbook" published by the People's Education Press in 1954. For the original peasant literacy textbooks, they can be added or deleted and used in accordance with the regulations of the Central Committee for Eliminating Illiteracy. Regarding literacy teaching, winter schools in various places should adopt different teaching methods according to the conditions of teachers and students. Many areas have tried the method of teaching in segments and units, and have achieved results. All localities can appropriately promote it according to specific conditions.

    The cultural learning of farmers who have reached the standard of literacy elimination should mainly continue to learn language to improve their reading ability. The textbook can be the "Peasant Language Textbook" of the People's Education Press; if conditions permit, they should also learn arithmetic (abacus, written calculation) to improve their calculation ability.

    III. Strengthen the organization of winter schools, and organize the peasant masses to study in a planned way according to different objects.

    In addition to winter school students, the political education of winter schools should also widely organize the general public to participate. Political instructors are uniformly equipped by counties and districts. In order to ensure the normal progress of political classes, all localities should appropriately stipulate the time for political classes and cultural classes.

    Winter schools and year-round farmer's cultural education should focus on absorbing village cadres and activists to participate in learning. All localities should vigorously improve their determination and confidence in learning, and help them overcome the difficulties in learning. First of all, they should arrange their work and study time well. In terms of learning organization, they can be separately compiled into classes or groups, or compiled together with the masses, according to their work situation and teacher conditions. If they are absent from class due to busy work, the teacher should give individual guidance to enable them to catch up with the progress. When work permits, the main township-level cadres can be rotated to the county or special area for off-the-job study, and concentrated to carry out teaching with the speed literacy method, so as to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy more quickly. The required funds can be solved by the following methods: food expenses are prepared by the students themselves (appropriate subsidies can be given to a few cadres with special difficulties); office expenses can be paid from the local illiteracy elimination funds. Teachers can be full-time cadres for literacy elimination in the local area or be drawn from other cadres and teachers, and their wages will be paid by the original unit.

    Attention should also be paid to the study of graduates from literacy classes to consolidate their learning results and continuously improve their cultural level. They should be organized into classes and groups to study separately according to their different levels. In places where there are no teachers or where classes (groups) cannot be formed due to the small number of people, they should also be organized to carry out self-study with leadership. In addition, they should also be actively organized to participate in various cultural and educational activities in rural areas, such as reading popular books and newspapers, running blackboard newspapers, and serving as literacy tutors.

    For high school graduates who participate in agricultural production, we should actively take appropriate measures to organize them to study on their own and participate in various cultural and educational activities in rural areas. Local Communist Youth League organizations should do more leadership work in this regard.

    IV. Conscientiously do a good job in the training and training of amateur teachers for farmers. Before the start of the winter school, amateur teachers should be given short-term training with the county as a unit. The main contents of the training are to thoroughly explain the guiding principles and policies of farmers' spare-time education, study farmers' literacy textbooks and teaching methods, and conduct certain current affairs policy education. In addition, during the winter school, they should be regularly organized to study teaching business. The methods are mainly to organize teaching research groups, study difficult problems in teaching, exchange teaching experience, hold observation teaching and regular teaching. Primary school teachers should assist and guide the professional study of amateur teachers for farmers. At the same time, it is necessary to call on the masses to respect amateur teachers and help them solve practical difficulties in order to enhance their sense of honor in serving the people. Teachers with excellent grades should be given honorary or material rewards.

    V. The quality of this year's winter school work has a great impact on completing the central work in rural areas this winter and further developing farmers' spare-time cultural and educational work. All localities must formulate winter school plans in accordance with the above requirements and in combination with local conditions, and start classes in a timely manner; during the winter school, they should conduct in-depth inspections, discover problems in a timely manner, and correct shortcomings. In addition to the fact that education administrative departments and literacy elimination work committees at all levels should closely cooperate with relevant departments under the leadership of the Party and the government to carry out this work, the Communist Youth League should mobilize League members and young people to actively participate in winter school learning or serve as teachers, and appoint special personnel to assist the government education departments in managing and guiding this work.

    It is hoped that the above instructions will be earnestly implemented in various places. The arrangements and development of winter schools should be reported to us in a timely manner. And submit a summary of winter school work by the end of June 1955.

    教育部和青年团中央
    关于一九五四年冬学工作的指示
    今年冬季全国农村需要做许多紧要的工作，如向广大农民普遍地进行中华人民共和国宪法的宣传教育，进一步开展以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，继续做好粮食、油料、棉布的统购统销和棉花的统购工作等。今年冬学首先必须紧密地结合这些工作任务，向农民进行政治教育。并以做好这一方面的工作为重点。另一方面，为了适应农业互助合作运动发展的需要，也应当积极组织农民学习文化。各地应根据这个精神，办好今年的冬学工作。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、冬学必须认真进行政治教育。它的主要内容应该是：第一，进行宪法的宣传教育，也就是进一步进行过渡时期国家总任务的教育，使农民明白宪法的重大意义和主要内容，鼓励和教育农民群众遵守宪法，为保证宪法的实施而努力。第二，学习农业互助合作政策，提高农民对农业合作化的认识，以促进农村合作运动的发展；学习在互助合作的基础上发展农业生产的政策，使农民认识增产粮食、棉花、油料和其他农产品的重要意义，以保证农业的增产。第三，学习统购统销的政策，使农民明白把农村的生产和消费纳入国家计划的道理，服从国家计划，把余粮和其他产品卖给国家，以支援祖国的工业建设。此外，还要进行时事教育和国防教育，宣传一定要解放台湾、动员补充兵员、反对美国的侵略政策和战争政策，积极保卫世界和平，以提高农民群众的爱国主义和国际主义思想。各省（市）应当密切结合当地实际情况负责编写上述政治教育教材并及时供应。
    二、今年冬学的文化教育，各地应根据冬闲时间的长短及其他条件，适当地提出一冬的教学要求，如一冬学完一册课本或识多少字等，以期切实达到逐步扫除文盲的目的。识字课教材可采用人民教育出版社一九五四年出版的“农民识字课本”。对原有的农民识字课本，可根据中央扫除文盲工作委员会的规定，加以增删使用。关于识字教学，各地冬学应根据教师和学员的条件，采取不同的教法。不少地区试用分段、分单元教学法，已获得成效，各地可根据具体条件适当推行。
    已达扫盲标准的农民的文化学习，主要应继续学习语文，以提高他们的阅读能力。教材可用人民教育出版社的“农民语文课本”；如有条件，还应当学习算术（珠算、笔算），以提高他们的计算能力。
    三、加强冬学的组织工作，根据不同对象，分别地有计划地组织农民群众学习。
    冬学的政治教育，除冬学学员外，还要广泛地组织一般群众参加。政治教员，由县、区负责统一配备。为使政治课正常进行，各地应适当规定政治课与文化课的时间。
    冬学和常年的农民文化教育，应当着重吸收乡村干部和积极分子参加学习。各地应大力提高他们学习的决心和信心，帮助他们克服学习中的困难，首先是应当很好地安排他们工作与学习的时间。在学习组织上，可以根据他们的工作情况和教师条件，或把他们单独编班编组，或同群众编在一起。他们中如有因工作忙而缺课时，教师应个别加以辅导，使他们能够赶上进度。对主要乡级干部，在工作允许时，可以轮流抽调他们到县或专区离职学习，集中起来用速成识字法进行教学，较快地完成扫盲任务。所需经费，可用以下办法解决：伙食费，由学员自备（对少数特殊困难的干部可以酌情补助）；办公费，可以从当地扫盲经费中开支。教师可由当地扫盲专职干部或抽调其他干部教师担任，他们的工资由原单位发给。
    对于扫盲班毕业学员，也应当注意他们的学习问题，以巩固他们的学习成果并不断提高他们的文化水平。应当根据他们的不同程度分别编班编组学习，在没有教师或因人数少不能编班（组）的地方，也要把他们组织起来，实行有领导的自学。此外，还要积极地组织他们参加农村中的各项文化教育活动，如阅读通俗书报、办黑板报、当扫盲辅导员等。
    对于参加农业生产的高小毕业生，应当积极地采取适当办法组织他们自学，并参加农村中的各项文化教育活动。各地青年团组织应该多进行这方面的领导工作。
    四、切实做好农民业余教师的培养和训练的工作。冬学开学前，对业余教师应当以县为单位进行短期训练。训练的主要内容，是深入地讲解农民业余教育的方针政策，研究农民识字课本和教学方法，并进行一定的时事政策教育。此外，应当在冬学期间，经常地组织他们学习教学业务。其办法，主要是组织教学研究小组，研究教学中的疑难问题，交流教学经验，举行观摩教学和定期传授等。小学教师对农民业余教师的业务学习，应当加以协助和辅导。同时要号召群众尊敬业余教师，并帮助他们解决实际困难，以增强他们为人民服务的光荣感。对成绩优良的教师，应当给以荣誉或物质的奖励。
    五、今年冬学工作的好坏，对完成今冬农村中心工作和进一步开展农民业余文化教育工作有很大的影响。各地必须根据上述要求，结合当地情况，制订冬学计划，及时开课；在冬学期间，应当深入检查，及时发现问题，纠正缺点。除各级教育行政部门和扫除文盲工作委员会应当在党和政府的领导下，协同有关部门密切配合进行这一工作外，青年团应当动员团员和青年群众，积极参加冬学学习或担任教学，并指定专人协助政府教育部门管理和指导这一工作。
    以上指示，希各地认真贯彻执行。对冬学布置及开展情况，要及时报告我们。并于一九五五年六月底报送冬学工作总结。
