Xinhua News Agency, October 1st, Rangoon dispatch: Following his visit to India, Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo traveled to Rangoon on September 26th and held talks with Burmese Prime Minister U Nu. After the talks concluded on September 28th, the two Prime Ministers issued a joint statement saying: The two Prime Ministers focused their discussions on "taking joint steps to ease international tensions, especially tensions in Southeast Asia." The statement said, "They have reached a general agreement on their attitudes towards these issues." The statement also indicated that the two Prime Ministers agreed that holding a conference of representatives from Asian and African countries would be beneficial to promoting world peace and that the conference should be held as soon as possible.
   Sastroamidjojo returned to Jakarta from Rangoon on September 29th.
   Xinhua News Agency, October 1st, TASS Jakarta, September 29th dispatch: Indonesian newspapers have discussed in detail the issue of the safety of the people of Southeast Asian countries. "Merdeka," "Indonesia Raya," "Harian Rakjat," and other newspapers believe that the talks between Nehru and Sastroamidjojo, and between U Nu and Sastroamidjojo, played a significant role in building the unity of the Asian people and in extending the Five Principles outlined in the Joint Statement by Zhou Enlai and Nehru to other Asian countries.
   These newspapers published a statement by Sidik Djojosukarto, Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party. He said that as long as "the government is led by the Nationalist Party (of Indonesia), Indonesia will not participate in any group that leads to war. Indonesia will continue to pursue its independent and active policy for the sake of peace." Sidik Djojosukarto fiercely criticized the Manila Treaty for creating a military bloc in Southeast Asia that "seriously endangers peace."
   D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, issued a statement emphasizing that the Five Principles stipulated in the Joint Statement by Zhou Enlai and Nehru are receiving increasing support "because these principles promote peace." Aidit pointed out the importance of Sastroamidjojo's visits to Delhi and Rangoon.
   Xinhua News Agency, TASS Moscow, September 29th dispatch: "Izvestia," commenting on Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo's recent visit to Delhi, pointed out that the attention of world public opinion, especially that of Asian countries, is focused on this visit and his talks with Prime Minister Nehru. What explains this is primarily that this meeting took place during an important period in the lives of the Asian people, a period in which, on the one hand, aggressive blocs are striving to drag many Asian countries into a military bloc aimed at the Asian national liberation movement; on the other hand, peace-loving people in Asia are trying to establish lasting peace and friendly coexistence among Asian countries.
   "Izvestia" published some of the words spoken by the two Prime Ministers in the statements they made during the talks and said that these words show that the conspiracy of the American ruling clique, which is trying to pursue the infamous "position of strength" policy in this part of the world, is meeting with increasingly resolute resistance in Asia.

    印度尼西亚和缅甸两国总理会谈结束
    两国将采取共同步骤缓和东南亚紧张局势
   【新华社一日讯】仰光消息：印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约在访问印度以后，在九月二十六日前往仰光，和缅甸总理吴努举行会谈。两国总理在二十八日会谈结束后发表联合声明说：两国总理曾着重讨论了关于“采取共同步骤来缓和国际紧张局势，特别是东南亚紧张局势”的问题。声明说：“他们已就对待这些问题的态度达成一般协议”。声明还表示，两国总理同意：举行一次亚洲和非洲国家代表的会议对促进世界和平是有益的，会议应尽早举行。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约已在九月二十九日由仰光返抵雅加达。
   【新华社一日讯】塔斯社雅加达九月二十九日讯：印度尼西亚各报详细讨论了东南亚各国人民的安全问题。“独立报”、“印度尼西亚新闻”、
  “人民日报”以及其他报纸认为，尼赫鲁和沙斯特罗阿米佐约之间的会谈以及吴努和沙斯特罗阿米佐约之间的会谈，在建立亚洲人民的团结以及把周恩来尼赫鲁联合声明中所说明的五项原则扩大到其他亚洲国家方面起了重大的作用。
    这些报纸刊载了印度尼西亚国民党主席西迪克·约约苏卡托的一篇声明。他说，只要是“政府由（印度尼西亚）国民党来领导，印度尼西亚就不会参加任何导向战争的集团。印度尼西亚将继续为了和平的利益执行它的独立的、积极的政策”。西迪克·约约苏卡托激烈抨击马尼拉条约在东南亚创立了一个“严重危及和平的”军事集团。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地发表一项声明，着重指出了周恩来和尼赫鲁的联合声明中所规定的五项原则正得到越来越大的支持，“因为这些原则促进着和平”。艾地指出了沙斯特罗阿米佐约到德里和仰光访问的重要意义。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科九月二十九日讯：“消息报”评论印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约最近访问德里时指出，世界公众，尤其是亚洲国家的公众的注意力都集中在他这次的访问以及他跟尼赫鲁总理进行的会谈上。足以解释这一点的首先是：这次会谈是在亚洲人民生活中的一个重要时期举行的，在这个时期，一方面，侵略集团正在竭力想把许多亚洲国家拖进一个针对着亚洲民族解放运动的军事集团；另一方面，亚洲爱好和平的人民正在设法建立亚洲国家间的巩固和平和友好共处。
    “消息报”刊载了两位总理在会谈中发表的声明中的一些话，并说，这些言论表明，正在试图在世界上这一部分地区奉行声名狼藉的“实力地位”政策的美国统治集团的阴谋，在亚洲受到了愈来愈坚决的抵抗。
