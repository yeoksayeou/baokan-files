    To Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army:
    We have received your telegram of October 25, 1954. We express our boundless excitement and heartfelt gratitude for the congratulations and thanks extended by you and the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which you represent.
    We, the entire commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, responding to the call of the joint declaration of the democratic parties and groups of the motherland, came to Korea to carry out the sacred mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and fought alongside the Korean People's Army and the Korean people against the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops and the Syngman Rhee clique, driving them back from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, forcing them to accept the proposal for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, and signing the armistice agreement. This is in the interests of the people of China and Korea, and also in the interests of the peace-loving people of the world.
    After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, we followed your orders and the orders of the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, implemented a complete ceasefire, and withdrew two kilometers from the military demarcation line. For more than a year, we have consistently and resolutely fulfilled the provisions of the armistice agreement, not entering the demilitarized zone a single step, while at the same time remaining highly vigilant, and striving to ensure the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement.
    During the days of the war, the friendship between us and the Korean people became even stronger and more consolidated. We all feel that we and the Korean people are like brothers in one big family. When the Korean people were restoring and rebuilding their homes destroyed by the war, we immediately drew a group of manpower and materials from our own positions to help the Korean people. We believe this is the responsibility that should be taken for this kind of brotherly friendship.
    In the future, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will continue, with the support of the people of the motherland and the support of the peace-loving people of the world, and on the basis of further consolidating cooperation with the Korean People's Army and the Korean people, to strive for the peaceful reunification and independence and freedom of Korea, to strive to smash the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice and all the provocative activities of the Syngman Rhee clique, to strive to accelerate the restoration and development of the Korean people's economy destroyed by the war, and to strive to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.
        The entire commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
                    October 25, 1954

    中国人民志愿军给金日成元帅的复电
    朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅：
    一九五四年十月二十五日的来电收到了，我们对于您和您所代表的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所给予的祝贺和感谢，表示无限的兴奋和衷心的感谢。
    我们，中国人民志愿军的全体指挥员和战斗员，响应祖国各民主党派联合宣言的号召，为执行抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务，开到朝鲜，协同朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，同美帝国主义侵略军和李承晚集团作战，并把他们从鸭绿江边打回到三八线附近，迫使他们不得不接受和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，签订了停战协定。这是符合于中朝两国人民利益，也是符合于全世界爱好和平人民利益的。
    朝鲜停战协定签订后，我们遵照着您和中国人民志愿军司令员的命令，实行完全停火并从军事分界线后撤二公里。一年多以来，我们始终坚决履行着停战协定的规定，不进入非军事区一步，同时，并时刻提高警惕，为保障停战协定的彻底实现而奋斗。
    在战争的日子里，我们和朝鲜人民的友谊更加增强和巩固起来。我们都有这样的感觉，我们和朝鲜人民是在一个大家庭里的兄弟一样。在朝鲜人民为恢复和重建被战争破坏了的家园的时候，我们便立即从自己的岗位上抽出一批人力、物力来帮助朝鲜人民。我们认为这是对待这种兄弟友谊应有的责任。
    今后，中国人民志愿军将继续在祖国人民的支持下，在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，在更进一步地巩固同朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民的合作的基础上，为争取朝鲜的和平统一和独立自由而奋斗，为粉碎美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋和李承晚集团的一切挑衅活动而奋斗，为加速恢复和发展被战争破坏的朝鲜人民经济而奋斗，为维护亚洲和世界的和平事业而奋斗。
        中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员
                    一九五四年十月二十五日
