    The Southeast Asia military alliance, painstakingly pieced together by the United States, is a tool for the US to continue pursuing its aggressive policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries and to prepare for new wars in Asia. Peace-loving people and public opinion in all countries unanimously condemn and resolutely oppose the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc established by the United States, believing that this US practice seriously endangers peace in Asia, causing concern and unease among Asian countries.
    However, the US ruling clique, which single-handedly planned the Southeast Asia military alliance, and their followers, are trying to portray this military bloc as a regional organization that seems to conform to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, in order to conceal its aggressive nature. The preamble to the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" signed in Manila hypocritically states that the contracting countries
  "reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations"; US Secretary of State Dulles said in his speech on September 14 that the Manila Treaty is "a regional convention". The US aggressive bloc always uses the name of the United Nations and the flag of this organization as a cover to conceal their crimes whenever they engage in aggression and undermine peace, and this is the case again. However, as in the past, this attempt by the US aggressive bloc is futile.
    The Southeast Asia military alliance is not a regional organization at all. On the contrary, it violates the wishes of the people of Southeast Asia and is a military bloc organized behind the backs of the majority of countries in the region. Of the eight member states of the Southeast Asia military alliance, five—the United States, Britain, France, Australia, and New Zealand—are Western colonial countries far from Southeast Asia or countries dependent on colonial countries, and they dominate the military bloc. The majority of Southeast Asian countries, such as India, Indonesia, Burma, and Ceylon, have refused to join the Southeast Asia military alliance, with India, Indonesia, and Burma firmly opposing the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." These countries account for more than four-fifths of the population of Southeast Asian countries, and it is obviously ridiculous to call a military bloc that has been rejected and opposed by these countries a regional organization in Southeast Asia.
    As for the three Asian countries that have been roped into the Southeast Asia military alliance by the United States—Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines—they are all countries whose hands and feet are tied by US military and economic "aid." The ruling groups of these countries are forced to participate in the military bloc pieced together by the United States to oppose other Asian countries, which violates the interests of their own countries and the interests of universal peace in Asia, and is therefore unanimously condemned and opposed by the people of their countries and the people of other Asian countries.
    Article 52 of the United Nations Charter regarding regional arrangements stipulates that regional arrangements or regional agencies must conform to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations, that is, the lofty goals of maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations, and promoting international cooperation. However, the Southeast Asia military alliance is completely contrary to this. India, Indonesia, and other countries believe that the Southeast Asia military alliance is in conflict with their foreign policies of advocating peaceful cooperation and establishing and expanding peace zones. This view is entirely correct.
    Dulles has also admitted in numerous statements that this military bloc is the product of the US aggressive policy of "united action" in Southeast Asia, which he and Eisenhower have long clamored for. People will certainly not forget that the so-called "united action" that Dulles and Eisenhower clamored for was to expand the Indochina war and carry out military adventures against China. Now, after the Geneva Conference has reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, the United States is actively establishing this military bloc and including Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai Vietnam within the scope of this military bloc, which is clearly to undermine the Indochina armistice and prepare to provoke a new war.
    It is precisely because of this that the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" manufactured by the United States cannot but directly contradict the provisions of Article 53 of the United Nations Charter. Article 53 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that, except for special measures stipulated for former enemy states, no action may be taken under regional arrangements or by regional agencies without the authorization of the Security Council. However, the various clauses of Article 4 of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" allow the contracting countries of this military bloc to use force against any country in Asia at will under any pretext. This once again shows how unfounded all the statements regarding the Southeast Asia military alliance recognizing the purposes and principles of the United Nations are.
    The Southeast Asia military alliance is actually a military bloc organized in the style of the North Atlantic Treaty. People only need to compare the clauses of the two treaties to see how similar they are. The North Atlantic Treaty also hypocritically declared the contracting countries' "belief in the objectives and principles of the Charter of the United Nations", but Articles 3, 4, and 5 of this treaty clearly stipulate the obligations undertaken by the contracting countries to expand armaments and prepare for war, all of which are attempts to undermine peace and violate the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Articles 2 and 4 of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" also stipulate the same military and war obligations for the contracting countries. The only difference is that the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" is even more blatant in its bellicose appearance than the North Atlantic Treaty. According to the provisions of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, the contracting countries can provoke war under the pretext of so-called "self-defense", while Article 4, paragraph 2 of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" even stipulates that as long as any contracting country considers it to be a "threat in any way other than armed attack" and "the impact or threat of any fact or situation that may endanger peace in the region", they shall "immediately consult" "the measures that should be taken". This means that the United States can drag other contracting countries into the flames of war it provokes at any time. It is obvious that the Southeast Asia military alliance poses a very serious threat to peace.
    The US aggressive bloc, the planners of the North Atlantic Treaty, also once promoted that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was a regional organization that conformed to the purposes of the United Nations, but this absurd statement has long been quickly bankrupt. Even Taft, the reactionary leader of the US aggressive bloc and the deceased US Senator, admitted in a speech on May 26, 1953, that the North Atlantic Treaty "is completely contrary to the (United Nations) Charter itself" and pointed out that "it is undoubtedly replacing the United Nations with a military alliance" as a tool to oppose Soviet aggression. Therefore, it is obviously even more difficult to believe that the US aggressive bloc is now attempting to conceal the aggressive nature of the Southeast Asia military alliance by the same means.
    The Southeast Asia military alliance is not only a military bloc that threatens peace, but the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" also openly allows the colonial countries of this bloc to obtain a so-called excuse to "prevent" "subversive activities", interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and suppress national liberation movements. American commentator Lippmann, who is familiar with the "secrets" of American foreign policy, pointed out in an article published in the "New York Herald Tribune" on September 17 that the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" gives the United States the possibility of "legally and permissibly interfering" in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries. US Secretary of State Dulles said even more triumphantly in his speech on September 14 that the Manila regulations on the so-called "prevention" of "subversive activities" "are clearer than any other security treaty that has been concluded" and "are a major step forward." This arrogant attitude of the US aggressive bloc nakedly exposes the ambitions of the US neo-colonialists.
    The US aggressive bloc's attempt to use this military alliance to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and create disputes between countries is also a violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Article 2, paragraph 4 of the Charter stipulates that "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations." Paragraph 7 of the same article also stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The so-called prevention of "subversive activities" by the Southeast Asia military alliance is obviously in conflict with these provisions. Regional organizations must not violate the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, from the point of view of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, the Southeast Asia military alliance cannot be regarded as a regional organization that conforms to the United Nations Charter. Isn't this obvious?
    Therefore, the US aggressive bloc's act of piecing together the Southeast Asia military alliance is another serious violation of the United Nations Charter. It is extremely shameful for them to attempt to conceal this fact and insist that it conforms to the United Nations Charter.
    This adventurous policy of the US aggressive bloc cannot but arouse serious vigilance among peace-loving people and countries in Asia. Asian countries, including Southeast Asian countries, firmly advocate friendly cooperation among themselves to safeguard collective peace in Asia. Although the US aggressive bloc is doing its utmost to provoke new wars in Asia and contain the increasingly developing national liberation movement in Asia, the united strength of the people of Asian countries will surely enable Asia to move forward along the path of guaranteeing collective peace and national independence.

    东南亚军事联盟是美国准备新战争的工具
    高集
    美国努力拼凑起来的东南亚军事联盟，是美国在亚洲继续推行其敌视中国人民和亚洲各国人民的侵略政策、准备新战争的工具。各国爱好和平人民和公众舆论一致谴责并坚决反对美国建立的东南亚侵略集团，认为美国的这种做法严重地危害了亚洲和平，引起了亚洲国家的忧虑和不安。
    但是，一手策划东南亚军事联盟的美国统治集团和他们的追随者，却力图把这个军事集团说成似乎是符合于联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的区域组织，以掩饰它的侵略性质。在马尼拉签订的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”的序言中就伪善地写道：缔约国家
  “重申它们对于联合国宪章所规定的宗旨和原则的信念”；美国国务卿杜勒斯在九月十四日的演说中更说：马尼拉条约是“一个区域性公约”。美国侵略集团每当他们进行侵略和破坏和平的勾当的时候，总是要利用联合国的名字和这个组织的旗帜作为幌子，来遮盖他们的罪恶，这次又是这样。但是，正如以往的情形一样，美国侵略集团的这种企图是徒劳的。
    东南亚军事联盟根本不是什么区域性组织，恰恰相反，它是违反东南亚各国人民的愿望的，并且是背着这个区域的大多数国家组织的一个军事集团。在东南亚军事联盟的八个成员国家中，有五个——美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚和新西兰——是远离东南亚的西方殖民国家或者是依附于殖民国家的国家，它们在这个军事集团中居于支配的地位。而东南亚的大多数国家，像印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和锡兰，都拒绝参加东南亚军事联盟，其中印度和印度尼西亚以及缅甸都坚决反对这个“东南亚集体防务条约”。这些国家的人口在东南亚国家中占了五分之四以上，遭到这些国家拒绝和反对的军事集团而妄称为东南亚的区域组织，显然是十分可笑的。
    至于被美国网罗到东南亚军事联盟中的三个亚洲国家—巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾，都是被美国的军事和经济“援助”绑住了手脚的国家。这些国家的统治集团被迫参加美国拼凑的军事集团，来反对其他的亚洲国家，是违反他们自己国家的利益和亚洲普遍和平的利益的，因而遭到他们国内人民和亚洲其他国家人民的一致谴责和反对。
    联合国宪章关于区域办法的第五十二条规定，区域办法或区域机关必须符合联合国的宗旨和目的，即维持国际和平和安全、发展国际间的友好关系和促进国际合作的崇高目的。但是，东南亚军事联盟却与此完全背道而驰。印度、印度尼西亚等国都认为，东南亚军事联盟是同它们主张和平合作、建立和扩大和平地区的外交政策相冲突的。这种看法是完全正确的。
    杜勒斯在屡次声明中也承认，这个军事集团是他自己和艾森豪威尔久已叫嚷过的在东南亚采取
  “联合行动”的美国侵略政策的产物。人们当然不会忘记，杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔所叫嚷过的所谓“联合行动”，就是要扩大印度支那战争，并对中国进行军事冒险。现在，在日内瓦会议已经取得关于恢复印度支那的和平的协议之后，美国又积极建立起这个军事集团，并把老挝、柬埔寨和保大越南划在这个军事集团范围之内，这显然是为了破坏印度支那停战，准备挑动新的战争。
    正是因为这样，所以美国一手制造的“东南亚集体防务条约”就不能不和联合国宪章第五十三条的规定直接相抵触。联合国宪章第五十三条规定，除对以前敌国所规定的特别措施外，如果没有安全理事会的授权就不能按照区域办法或由区域机关采取任何行动。但是，“东南亚集体防务条约”的第四条各款，却使这个军事集团的缔约国家可以随便以任何借口对亚洲的任何国家使用武力。这就再度说明了，关于东南亚军事联盟承认联合国宗旨和原则的一切说法，是多么毫无根据。
    东南亚军事联盟实际上是按照北大西洋公约的样式组织起来的军事集团。人们只要把两个条约的条文对照一下，就可以看出两者之间是如何地相似。北大西洋公约也同样伪善地申明了缔约国家“对于联合国宪章目标与原则所具之信念”，但是这个公约的第三条、第四条和第五条，却明确地规定了缔约国家所承担的扩军备战和进行战争的义务，而这些都是企图破坏和平和违反联合国宪章的规定的。“东南亚集体防务条约”的第二条和第四条也为缔约国家规定了同样的军事和战争义务。所不同的是“东南亚集体防务条约”比北大西洋公约的好战面目更为露骨。按照北大西洋公约第五条的规定，缔约国家可以用所谓“自卫”的借口挑动战争，而“东南亚集体防务条约”的第四条的第二款甚至规定了只要任何缔约国家认为是属于“武装进攻以外的任何方式的威胁”以及“可能危及本区域和平的任何事实或情势的影响或威胁”，都要“立即磋商”“应当采取的措施”。这就是说，这可以使美国随时把其他的缔约国家拖入它所挑起的战火之中。显而易见，东南亚军事联盟对和平的危害性是十分严重的。
    北大西洋公约的策划者美国侵略集团也曾经宣传说，北大西洋公约组织是什么符合于联合国宗旨的区域组织，但是这种荒谬的说法，早就迅速地破产了。甚至美国侵略集团中的反动头子、已死的美国参议员塔夫脱在一九五三年五月二十六日发表的演说中，也承认北大西洋公约“与（联合国）宪章本身是完全矛盾的”，并指出“它无疑是以一种军事同盟代替联合国”，来作为反对苏联的侵略工具。因此，现在美国侵略集团还企图以同样的手法来掩饰东南亚军事联盟的侵略性质，显然是更难令人相信了。
    东南亚军事联盟不但是一个威胁和平的军事集团，而且“东南亚集体防务条约”还公然允许这个集团的殖民国家得到一个所谓“防止”“颠覆活动”的借口，干涉他国内政，镇压民族解放运动。熟悉美国外交政策“秘密”的美国评论家李普曼在九月十七日美国“纽约先驱论坛报”上发表的文章中指出：“东南亚集体防务条约”使美国取得了对东南亚国家的内政“进行合法的和得到许可的干涉的可能性”。美国国务卿杜勒斯在九月十四日的演说中更得意洋洋地表示，马尼拉关于所谓“防止”“颠覆活动”的规定“比已经缔结的任何其他安全条约都要明确”，“是向前进了一大步”。美国侵略集团的这种狂妄的态度，赤裸裸地暴露了美国新殖民主义者的野心。
    美国侵略集团利用这种军事联盟干涉他国内政，制造各国争端的企图，也是违反联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的。宪章第二条第四款规定“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他办法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立。”同条第七款又规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件。”而东南亚军事联盟的所谓防止
  “颠覆活动”，显然是同这些规定相冲突的。区域组织不得违反联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，因而，从干涉别国内政一点来说，东南亚军事联盟也是不能看成符合联合国宪章的区域组织。这不是十分明显的吗？
    所以，美国侵略集团拼凑东南亚军事联盟的行为，是对联合国宪章的又一严重的破坏。它们企图掩盖这个事实，硬说符合联合国宪章，这是十分可耻的。
    美国侵略集团的这种冒险政策，不能不引起亚洲各国爱好和平的人民和国家的严重警惕。亚洲各国包括东南亚国家在内，坚决主张相互之间进行友好合作，以维护亚洲的集体和平。尽管美国侵略集团竭力企图在亚洲挑动新的战争，并遏制在亚洲日益发展的民族解放运动，但是亚洲各国人民团结的力量，必将使亚洲沿着保障集体和平和民族独立的道路上前进。
