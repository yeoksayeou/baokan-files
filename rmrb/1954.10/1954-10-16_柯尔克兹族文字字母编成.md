The Kyrgyz Language Research Committee of the Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Region in Xinjiang Province, based on the language conditions of the people in various parts of the autonomous region and with reference to the writing system of the Kyrgyz people in the Soviet Union, has researched and compiled twenty-seven Kyrgyz alphabet letters and written the first material on the Kyrgyz language. This material has now been printed and distributed to various places to widely solicit the opinions of the Kyrgyz people, and then the Kyrgyz language will be officially formulated.

The Kyrgyz people originally had their own writing system, but before liberation, under the long-term oppression of reactionary rule, they had no right or opportunity to use their own national language. The vast majority of the Kyrgyz people forgot their own national language and had to use Russian and Uyghur alphabets for transliteration. After the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government in July of this year, in order to realize the nationalization of the autonomous organs and the development of cultural and educational undertakings in the autonomous region, the Kyrgyz Language Research Committee was immediately established, with more than 30 people engaged in research work.

    柯尔克兹族文字字母编成
    新疆省克兹勒苏柯尔克兹族自治区柯族文字研究委员会，根据自治区各地人民的语言情况，并参考苏联吉尔吉斯族的文字，已研究编成了二十七个柯尔克兹族文字字母，写成了第一本关于柯尔克兹文字的材料。这个材料现已印发各地，广泛征求柯尔克兹族人民群众的意见，然后再正式制定柯尔克兹族的文字。
    柯尔克兹族人民原来有自己的文字，但在解放前，他们在反动统治的长期压迫下，没有使用本民族文字的权利和机会，广大的柯尔克兹族人民都忘记了本民族的文字，不得不用俄文字母和维吾尔文字母拼音。今年七月间自治区人民政府成立后，为了实现自治机关的民族化和发展自治区的文化教育事业，随即成立了柯族文字研究委员会，由三十多人从事研究工作。　（新华社）
