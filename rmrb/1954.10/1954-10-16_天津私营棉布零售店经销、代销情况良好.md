    Tianjin's 166 private cotton cloth retail stores have been operating well and their turnover has been steadily increasing since the state implemented planned cotton cloth supply and executed distribution and sales tasks. According to a survey and statistics conducted by the state-owned textile company on 131 private cotton cloth retail stores in the city, the total turnover in September increased by more than half compared to August.

    Many employees of cloth stores actively assist capitalists in improving business management. Xinlongxiang Silk and Cloth Store used to lack planning in purchasing goods and the variety was incomplete, often failing to meet customer needs. After this store distributed cotton cloth for the state, the employees negotiated with the capitalists to increase the purchase quantity of white cloth and added a variety of new printed cotton fabrics. Employees of Hongxiang Silk and Cloth Store suggested that capitalists establish an employee duty system to be responsible for timely tidying up of the display windows, displaying new patterns of fabrics in them to facilitate customer selection. Employees of Qianxiangyi Chenji Cloth Store suggested that capitalists eliminate nine unreasonable expenses, and the employees also supervised the illegal activities of the capitalists. Hongxiang Silk and Cloth Store used to mix first-class and second-class goods of fabrics such as valitin and khaki together and sell them at first-class prices, deceiving customers. Now, the employees have pointed out to the capitalists that the good and inferior goods should be separated and sold to customers at the prices stipulated by the state. Employees of Wenzhu Silk and Cloth Store negotiated with the capitalists to implement a damaged goods registration system, stipulating that in the event of damaged fabrics, they should be marked in a timely manner so that customers do not suffer losses. Many employees of private cotton cloth retail stores also assisted and supervised capitalists in checking and reducing unreasonable prices of wool and silk materials.

    In order to take care of the business of these private cotton cloth distribution stores, the state-owned textile company appropriately increased the purchase of fast-selling goods during wholesale. It was decided that some of the cloth for equipment used by government agencies and enterprises, cloth for weddings and funerals of citizens, and small amounts of cloth used by small handicraftsmen should be supplied by private cotton cloth retail stores. The state-owned cotton cloth wholesale departments in each district also planned to allocate some offcut and remnant pieces of cloth outside the planned supply to small distribution stores to facilitate their business.

    天津私营棉布零售店经销、代销情况良好
    天津市一百六十六户私营棉布零售店，在国家实行棉布计划供应执行经销、代销任务以来，营业情况良好，营业额稳步上升。据国营花纱布公司对全市一百三十一户私营棉布零售店的调查统计，九月份的营业总额比八月份增加一半以上。
    许多布店的职工都积极协助资方改善经营管理。信隆祥绸布店过去进货缺乏计划，品种不全，常常不能满足顾客需要。这家店为国家经销棉布后，职工就和资方协商，扩大白布的进货数量，并增加了多种多样的新花布。鸿翔绸布店职工建议资方建立职工值班制度，负责及时整理橱窗，把新花样的布匹陈列在里面，便利顾客挑选。谦祥益辰记布店的职工建议资方取消了九项不合理的开支，对资方的违法行为，职工也进行了监督。鸿翔绸布店过去把华达呢、卡其布等布匹的头等货和二等货混在一起，都按头等货价格出售欺骗顾客。现在职工已向资方指出：应该把好次货分开，按照国家规定的价格卖给顾客。文竹绸布店职工和资方协商，实行残货登记制度，规定遇有残损的布匹，及时标明不让顾客受到损失。不少私营棉布零售店职工还协助和监督资方检查并降低了呢绒和绸料等的不合理价格。
    国营花纱布公司为照顾这些私营棉布经销店的营业，批购时适当增加畅销货。凡机关企业设备用布、市民婚丧用布和小手工业者零星用布，决定一部分由私营棉布零售店供应。各区国营棉布批发部门并有计划地分配了一些计划供应以外的轴头布和刀口布等品种给小的经销店，便于他们维持营业。
