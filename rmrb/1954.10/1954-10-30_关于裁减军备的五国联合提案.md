The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee concluded its discussion on the issue of arms reduction on October 27th. The result of the discussion was that the committee unanimously adopted a joint proposal put forward by the delegations of Canada, France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

The five-nation joint proposal stipulates that the Soviet Union's new proposal on arms reduction and the report of the United Nations Disarmament Commission should serve as the basis for further discussion in order to find a solution that is acceptable to all. The submission of the five-nation joint proposal is the first unanimous action taken by the four major powers in the United Nations since 1946. Therefore, its significance far exceeds procedural matters. It not only makes it possible to break the deadlock that the disarmament issue has been in for many years, but also has significant implications for further easing international tensions.

The United Nations General Assembly's discussion on disarmament this time was conducted under new circumstances that differed from the past. The bankruptcy of the US monopoly on atomic and hydrogen weapons has increasingly encouraged the confidence of people of all countries in striving for arms reduction and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, the success of the Geneva Conference proves that even on issues where the two sides have great differences, reaching an agreement is not impossible. The pessimistic tone deliberately spread by the United States that it is impossible to reach an agreement on the disarmament issue is becoming increasingly difficult to believe.

The major progress made by the United Nations General Assembly is due to the initiative of the Soviet delegation. In its new proposal on disarmament submitted on September 30th, the Soviet Union adopted the suggestions made by the United Kingdom and France on June 11th as its basis. The Soviet proposal adopted the UK and French proposals on phased reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces, thereby greatly narrowing the differences between the two sides on the important issue of the stages of disarmament. The Soviet proposal also stipulates that armaments and armed forces should be reduced according to mutually agreed quotas, and adopted the UK and French suggestion that the number of armaments and armed forces of each country on December 31, 1953, should be taken as the starting point for the reduction. The Soviet delegation continues to believe that it is extremely important for countries to reach an agreement on the unconditional renunciation of the use of atomic weapons, but it does not insist that conventional armaments and armed forces be reduced and international supervision be established only after such an agreement has been reached. In this way, the Soviet proposal deprives Western countries of the excuse they have used for many years to refuse to reach an agreement on the disarmament issue.

The Soviet proposal opened up the prospect of making real progress on the issue of disarmament, and therefore received widespread welcome both inside and outside the United Nations. Representatives of many small and medium-sized countries praised the initiative of the Soviet delegation at the meeting and asked Western countries to seriously consider the Soviet Union's views. A reporter for the British "Observer" called the impact of the Soviet proposal in the United Nations an "unstoppable tide of optimism." It is the great moral force of this tide that has played a decisive role in the attitude of Western countries.

Of course, the United States and some other Western countries, headed by the United States, did not fail to express panic about the great impact of the Soviet proposal. They feared that if the Soviet proposal were implemented, it would bring insurmountable difficulties to the policy of arms expansion and war preparations they were pursuing. For example, some American news agencies have reflected the mood of the American officials, saying that if arms reduction is really possible, then people will be more convinced that rearming West Germany is "unnecessary." It is for this reason that the representatives of the United States and some other Western countries tried their best to minimize the significance of the Soviet proposal and emphasized the differences of opinion between the two sides at the meeting. In his speech, the US representative even openly violated the facts by saying that the differences between the Soviet Union and Western countries were "almost as great as in the past." In fact, the US representative's speech was not only against the Soviet proposal, but also against the British and French suggestions.

However, under the strong pressure of public opinion from all parties, the United States finally had to agree to submit a five-nation joint proposal together with the Soviet Union and other countries.

If the five-nation joint proposal passed by the Political Committee is approved at the plenary session of the General Assembly, the issue of arms reduction will be handed over to the Disarmament Commission and its sub-committees to continue to seek a solution. These committees will be responsible for reaching an agreement on the differences that still exist between the Soviet proposal and the British and French suggestions, especially regarding the functions and powers of the international supervisory body.

There are signs that the United States intends to continue to create difficulties in reaching an agreement in future discussions. The United States is currently insisting on its long-discredited claim that the power to sanction countries that violate international disarmament conventions should be given to the aforementioned international supervisory body. As everyone knows, according to the United Nations Charter, this power of sanction should belong to the United Nations Security Council.

### 关于裁减军备的五国联合提案

    关于裁减军备的五国联合提案
    联合国大会政治委员会关于裁减军备问题的讨论，已经在十月二十七日结束。讨论的结果是：委员会一致通过了加拿大、法国、苏联、美国和英国五国代表团提出的联合提案。
    五国联合提案规定以苏联关于裁减军备的新提案和联合国裁军委员会报告书作为进一步讨论的基础，以便找出可以为大家接受的解决办法。五国联合提案的提出，是自从一九四六年以来，四大国在联合国内第一次采取的一致行动。因此，它的意义远远超过程序性质。它不仅使裁军问题有可能摆脱多年来所处的僵持局面，而且在进一步缓和国际局势方面，有着重大的意义。
    联合国大会关于裁军问题的这次讨论，是在和过去不同的新形势之下进行的。美国对于原子武器和氢武器垄断的破产，日益鼓舞着各国人民争取裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器的信心。同时，日内瓦会议的成就证明，即使在双方分歧很大的问题上，达成协议也并不是不可能的。美国所故意散布的裁军问题无法达成协议的悲观论调，是越来越难以令人相信了。
    联合国大会之所以能取得的这一重大进展，是由于苏联代表团的主动。苏联在九月三十日提出的裁军新提案中，采纳了英法两国六月十一日的建议作为其基础。苏联提案采纳了英法两国关于分阶段裁减常规军备和武装部队的主张，从而使得双方关于裁军的阶段这一重要问题上的意见，大大接近了。苏联提案还规定根据一致同意的定额来裁减军备和武装部队，并且采纳了英法建议，规定以各国一九五三年十二月三十一日的军备和武装部队数量作为裁减的起算点。苏联代表团继续认为，各国达成无条件放弃使用原子武器的协议是极其重要的，但是它并不坚持必须在达成这一协议以后才能实行裁减常规军备和武装部队以及建立国际监督等措施。这样，苏联提案就剥夺了西方国家多年来拒绝在裁军问题上达成协议的借口。
    苏联建议打开了在裁军问题上取得真正进展的前景，因而在联合国内外受到了普遍的欢迎。许多中小国家的代表都在会上赞扬苏联代表团的主动，并要求西方国家认真考虑苏联的意见。英国“观察家报”的一个记者把苏联建议在联合国中的影响称为一种“势不可当的乐观潮流”。正是这种潮流的巨大道义力量，对西方国家的态度发生了决定性的作用。
    当然，以美国为首的某些西方国家对苏联建议的巨大影响不是没有表示恐慌。他们害怕，苏联建议一旦实现了，就会给他们奉行的扩军备战政策带来难以克服的困难。例如某些美国通讯社就曾反映美国官方的情绪说，如果裁减军备真正有可能实现，那么人们就会更加相信，重新武装西德是“没有必要了”。正是由于这个缘故，美国和某些其他西方国家的代表们，在会上竭力缩小苏联建议的意义，并强调双方意见的分歧。美国代表在发言中甚至公然违反事实说，苏联同西方国家的分歧“差不多和过去一样大”。事实上，美国代表的发言，不仅是在反对苏联的提案，而且也在反对英法的建议。
    但是，在各方舆论的强大压力下，美国终于不得不同意和苏联及其他国家一道提出五国联合提案。
    政治委员会通过的五国联合提案如果在大会全体会议上得到批准，裁减军备问题就将交给裁军委员会及其小组委员会去继续求得解决。这些委员会将负责把苏联提案和英法建议间尚存在的分歧，特别是在关于国际监督机构的职能和权力方面，取得协议。
    迹象显示，美国正打算在未来的讨论中继续对达成协议制造困难。美国目前正在坚持它早已被驳倒了的主张，要求把制裁违反国际裁军公约的国家的权力，交给上述国际监督机构。大家知道，根据联合国宪章，这种制裁权力是应该属于联合国安全理事会的。
