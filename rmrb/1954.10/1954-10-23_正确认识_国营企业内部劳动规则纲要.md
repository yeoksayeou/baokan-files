    Correctly Understand "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises"
    Hai Quan
    Our country has entered a period of planned economic construction. The tasks of realizing national industrialization and gradually transitioning to a socialist society require us to resolutely oppose all behaviors that undermine labor discipline and further consolidate labor discipline. After the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, various regions conducted education on consolidating labor discipline among the broad masses of workers, greatly enhancing the awareness and organization of the workers. In order to consolidate the achievements of labor discipline education, in addition to continuing political and ideological education for workers, it is also necessary to formulate a more complete set of systems. Therefore, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, based on the proposal of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, formulated and promulgated the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises." This measure is of great significance for guaranteeing and consolidating labor discipline within state-owned enterprises.
      After the promulgation of the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises," it was warmly supported by the vast majority of workers across the country. However, some workers and cadres had an unclear understanding of the spirit and essence of the outline, leading to some confused thoughts. In order to correctly implement the provisions of the outline and enable it to fully play its role in maintaining labor discipline, it is necessary to clarify some of the current misunderstandings among workers.
    A common situation among workers is insufficient attention to the issuance of the outline, thinking that the publication of the outline "has nothing to do with me" or "is meaningless." "Let them publish it; as long as I don't break the law, it has nothing to do with me." This statement is incorrect. Internal labor rules are very closely related to every worker. We know that as the country's economic construction expands, national plans become more detailed and complete, product quality requirements become higher, and production technology becomes more complex and rigorous. Therefore, in order for each worker to correctly perform labor and complete their production quota, it is necessary to strengthen labor organization and discipline and clarify their basic responsibilities. The formulation of the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises" is to meet this objective requirement. It clearly defines the scope of labor discipline, telling workers what labor discipline is, what it includes, what constitutes compliance with labor discipline, and what constitutes violation or disruption of labor discipline. With such clear regulations, workers can better comply with labor discipline and help others comply with labor discipline. The implementation of internal labor rules depends on the collective strength of the broad masses of workers. Only by correctly carrying out criticism and self-criticism among the masses, establishing a new moral atmosphere of "labor is glorious, evading labor is shameful," and making consolidating labor discipline the opinion of the masses can labor discipline be truly consolidated and internal labor rules thoroughly implemented. If we all adopt an attitude of "it has nothing to do with me," we will inevitably condone those who undermine labor discipline to continue their misdeeds, inevitably weaken the organization and discipline of the working class, and seriously harm the common interests of the working class.
    A small number of workers mistakenly believe that internal labor rules are "something to discipline us," feeling that "labor rules are too strict and too harsh." The reason for this error is mainly due to confusing our internal labor rules with the factory rules of capitalist countries. Yes, the factory rules of capitalist countries are indeed tools used to "discipline" workers. Capitalists use factory rules to force workers to create more wealth for them and maximize their profits, while workers become poorer day by day. This kind of factory rule, which aims to intensify the exploitation of laborers, relies on the terror of unemployment, poverty, and the threat of hunger to maintain it. It uses sticks, insults, and the means of torturing laborers to force them to obey. However, our internal labor rules are completely different because we are a new China led by the working class. Our labor discipline relies on the conscious spirit of the broad masses of workers to maintain it, and the foundation of this conscious spirit is the complete unity of national interests and the individual interests of workers. Our fundamental method of consolidating labor discipline is persuasion and education, so that workers can ideologically recognize the importance of observing labor discipline. Of course, our labor discipline also has its limitations and constraints, but what it limits and constrains are only the few behaviors that endanger production and do not comply with labor discipline. This is beneficial to the country and the vast majority of workers. Even if those who violate labor discipline are punished, it is to achieve the purpose of educating them and all workers. As for saying that the regulations are too strict, this is not in line with the facts. The various provisions of the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises" are not excessive. They are things that enterprise administration and all workers should and can do. In fact, the vast majority of workers have already done so in the past. Only a small number of workers still exhibit behaviors that violate and undermine labor discipline, such as absenteeism, taking leave on false pretenses, evading labor, working passively, disobeying commands and assignments, and failing to comply with operating procedures and safety regulations. It is absolutely necessary to be stricter with these people.
    Some workers also believe that the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises" should not stipulate compensation for damage to machinery and equipment, fearing that they will not be able to afford it. This concern is unnecessary because Article 21 of the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises" stipulates that those who are liable for compensation are those who do not comply with operating procedures or are irresponsible and produce defective products or damage tools and equipment in their work. As long as we earnestly abide by operating procedures and work conscientiously, we will not be materially liable for compensation. Earnestly complying with operating procedures and working conscientiously are things that every worker should and can do. The purpose of stipulating compensation in the outline is to attract the attention and vigilance of all workers, to promote all workers to earnestly abide by operating procedures and work conscientiously, and to reduce losses to state property. This provision is absolutely necessary for those who ignore disciplinary action. In terms of reason and sentiment, since they have caused losses to state property, it is completely reasonable to stipulate that they bear material compensation liability. At the same time, in order to distinguish the severity of the circumstances, the outline also stipulates "responsibility for full or partial compensation in terms of material." In order to take care of the workers' lives, it is stipulated that "the amount of compensation deducted each time shall not exceed 30% of the worker's actual monthly wage." In order to encourage workers to work hard, quickly correct mistakes, it is also stipulated that "if they quickly correct mistakes and perform well, the amount of compensation may be reduced or exempted as appropriate." This can be said to be very reasonable and completely justified.
    Some enterprise cadres also have some misunderstandings about the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises." Some comrades feel that the outline is too strict, and our current enterprise work level is still low, and the masses are not accustomed to it, fearing that it will be impossible to do it all at once. Some people even confuse strictly enforcing discipline with militaristic coercion, and therefore dare not resolutely implement the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises." One of the reasons for this erroneous thinking is that these comrades have underestimated the degree of awareness of the masses and exaggerated the difficulties. In fact, under the education of the Party over the years, most of the broad masses of workers can consciously abide by labor discipline and fight against various phenomena that undermine labor discipline. Consolidating labor discipline is precisely their common requirement and wish. Therefore, the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises" has a broad mass base. It is unfounded to mistakenly believe that the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises" is too strict and fear that workers will not accept it. If we accommodate a small number of backward workers and dare not resolutely implement internal labor rules, we will inevitably become divorced from the broad masses of workers; even those few backward workers, once they become aware, will also think that this approach is wrong. Of course, we must also estimate that the implementation of internal labor rules will inevitably encounter some difficulties and resistance, but as long as we correctly carry out a series of work, these difficulties and resistance can be overcome. As for the question of whether we will commit compulsory command errors, it mainly lies in whether our way of thinking and working methods are correct. As long as we conscientiously understand and study the actual situation, carry out work according to the actual situation, and are good at raising the level of awareness of the masses, educate the masses to abide by it, rather than using a rude attitude and simple methods to order the masses to abide by it, we will not commit compulsory command errors.
    Some comrades also believe that after the promulgation of the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises," the daily work of consolidating labor discipline can be ended. In the future, just act according to the rules. This statement is incorrect. It should be known that to make all workers consciously establish a communist labor attitude, consolidate labor discipline, and eliminate all non-working-class ideological influences within the working class is by no means a matter of overnight, but a long-term and arduous process of ideological struggle. Comrade Lenin said: "To create new labor discipline, to create new forms of social connection between people, to create new forms and methods of attracting people to labor—this requires many years, decades of work." Therefore, it must not be thought that after the promulgation of the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises," it can be a one-time solution and everything will be fine. We not only cannot end the daily work of consolidating labor discipline, but should also carry out more work regularly and persistently, especially political and ideological work. Only in this way can the outline be implemented and labor discipline be further consolidated and strengthened.
    As for thinking that after the promulgation of the outline, the method of persuasion and education can be used less or not at all. In the future, labor discipline can be consolidated simply by strengthening punishment. This is even more completely wrong. It is absolutely necessary to give appropriate punishment to a small number of elements who undermine labor discipline and refuse to correct their mistakes after repeated education, but the purpose of our punishment of workers is not simply for punishment, but to learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones and to cure the disease to save the patient. It is to educate the punished person himself and to educate all workers. The fundamental method of consolidating labor discipline is education. Only by carrying out political and ideological education deeply and regularly, especially communist education, can labor discipline become the discipline that the broad masses of workers consciously abide by. Of course, we do not deny the necessary coercive measures. It is absolutely necessary to give appropriate punishment to workers who violate labor discipline in a timely manner, depending on the severity of the circumstances, especially for a small number of elements who seriously undermine labor discipline and refuse to correct their mistakes after repeated education. They should be dealt with appropriately in a timely manner according to the severity of their circumstances. However, coercive measures are not simply punishing the masses of workers. Comrade Lenin said: "Only when we can create a persuasive basis for coercive measures in advance can we use coercive measures correctly and victoriously." If the principle of persuasion and education is not adopted in the work of consolidating labor discipline, but all mistakes, large and small, are sent to the court or dismissed, thinking that simply punishing a batch and dismissing a batch can complete the task of consolidating labor discipline, this will instead prompt some workers to sympathize with the punished, separate us from the masses, and fail to achieve the purpose of consolidating labor discipline.
    Strictly abiding by internal labor rules is the sacred duty of all workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff members of the People's Republic of China. We should resolutely implement the "Outline of Internal Labor Rules for State-Owned Enterprises," conscientiously study this document, understand its spirit and essence, thoroughly correct various erroneous thoughts and understandings, consciously abide by labor discipline, and strive to fulfill and over fulfill the state's production plan.

    正确认识“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”
    海泉
    我国已经进入了有计划的经济建设时期，实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会的任务，要求我们必须坚决反对破坏劳动纪律的各种行为，进
  一步巩固劳动纪律。中国工会第七次全国代表大会以后，各地在广大职工群众中曾经进行了关于巩固劳动纪律的教育，大大地提高了职工群众的觉悟程度和组织程度。为了巩固劳动纪律教育的成果，除了继续对职工进行政治思想教育以外，还必须制订一套比较完善的制度。因此，中央人民政府政务院根据中华全国总工会的建议，制订并颁布了“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”，这个措施，对于保证和巩固国营企业内部的劳动纪律，是有很大意义的。
      “国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”颁布以后，得到了全国绝大多数职工的热烈拥护，但也有一部分职工和干部对纲要的精神和实质认识不清，产生了一些混乱的思想。为了正确贯彻纲要的规定，使它能够充分地发挥维护劳动纪律的作用，就须要对目前职工中的一些错误的认识加以澄清。
    职工中比较多的情况是对纲要的发布重视不够，认为纲要的公布“与我无关”、“没有什么意思”。“公布只管公布，我只要不犯法，与我无关”。这种说法是不正确的。内部劳动规则与每个职工都有极密切的关系。我们知道，随着国家经济建设的日益扩大，国家计划日益周密和完备了，产品质量的要求更高了，生产技术也更加复杂和严格了，因此每个职工要能正确地进行劳动，完成自己的生产定额，就必须加强劳动的组织性和纪律性，明确自己的基本职责，“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”的制订就是为了满足这个客观的要求。它明确地规定了劳动纪律的范围，告诉职工什么是劳动纪律，它包括那些内容，怎样才算遵守劳动纪律，怎样就是违反或破坏劳动纪律，有了这样明确的规定以后，就使职工们能更好地遵守劳动纪律和帮助别人遵守劳动纪律。内部劳动规则的贯彻有赖于广大职工群众的集体力量，只有在群众中正确地开展批评与自我批评，树立起“劳动光荣，逃避劳动可耻”的新道德风气，使巩固劳动纪律成为群众的舆论以后，劳动纪律才能真正巩固，内部劳动规则才能彻底贯彻。如果我们都抱着“与我无关”的态度，势必纵容了那些破坏劳动纪律的人继续作恶，势必涣散工人阶级的组织性和纪律性，使工人阶级的共同利益受到严重的危害。
    有少数职工错误地认为内部劳动规则是“整我们的东西”，感到“劳动规则太严、太厉害”。产生这种错误看法的原因，主要是由于把我们的内部劳动规则与资本主义国家的工厂规则混同了起来。是的，资本主义国家的工厂规则的确是用来“整”工人的工具，资本家通过工厂规则强迫工人为他们创造更多的财富，使他们获得最大限度的利润，而工人们却一天天的贫困下去。这种以加紧剥削劳动者为目的的工厂规则，是依靠失业的恐怖、贫困和饥饿的威胁来维持的，是用棍棒、凌辱和摧残劳动者的手段来强迫劳动者遵守的。但是，我们的内部劳动规则却与此完全不同，因为我们是以工人阶级为领导阶级的新中国，我们的劳动纪律是依靠广大职工群众的自觉精神来维持的，这种自觉精神的基础就是国家利益和职工个人利益的完全一致性。我们巩固劳动纪律的根本方法是说服教育，使职工在思想上认识遵守劳动纪律的重要性。当然我们的劳动纪律也有它的限制和约束作用，但是它所限制和约束的仅仅是那些危害生产的少数不遵守劳动纪律的行为。这对国家和广大职工都是有利的。即使对违反劳动纪律的人给予处分，也是为了达到教育其本人和全体职工的目的。至于说规定太严，这是不符合事实的。“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”的各项规定并不过份，它是企业行政和全体职工应该作到而且也能够作到的事情。事实上绝大多数职工过去也已经做到了的，只有一小部分职工中仍存在着旷工、借故请假、逃避劳动、消极怠工、不服从指挥调度、不遵守操作规程和保安规程等违反和破坏劳动纪律的行为。对这些人严格一些是完全必要的。
    还有些职工认为“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”不应该规定破坏机器设备等要赔偿，害怕自己赔不起。这种顾虑是不必要的，因为“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”第二十一条规定要负赔偿责任的是指那些不遵守操作规程或不负责任而在工作中产生废品或损坏工具和设备的职工，只要我们切实遵守操作规程并认真负责地工作，就不会发生在物质上负赔偿责任的问题。切实遵守操作规程和认真负责地工作是我们每个职工应该作到而且也能够作到的事情。在纲要中规定赔偿的目的是为了引起全体职工的注意和警惕，是为了促使全体职工切实遵守操作规程并认真负责地工作，使国家财产少受损失。这个规定对于那些忽视纪律处分的人是完全必要的。在情理上来讲，他们既然使国家财产遭受损失，规定他们负物质上的赔偿责任也是完全合理的。同时为了分别情节的轻重，纲要中还规定“负物质上的全部或部分赔偿之责。”为了照顾职工的生活，规定“每次扣除之赔偿数目最多不得超过该职工一个月的实际工资的百分之三十。”为了鼓励职工努力工作，迅速改正错误，还规定“如其迅速改正错误，表现良好，赔偿金额可酌情予以减免。”这可以说是非常合理完全应该的了。
    也有少数企业干部，对“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”存在着一些误解。有一些同志觉得纲要规定得太严格，我们现有企业的工作水平还低，群众还不习惯，害怕一下做起来办不到。有的人甚至把严格地执行纪律和军阀主义强迫命令混同起来，因而不敢坚决地把“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”贯彻下去。产生这种错误思想的原因之一，是这些同志过低地估计了群众的觉悟程度，夸大了困难。事实上，几年来广大职工群众在党的教育下，大部分都能自觉地遵守劳动纪律，并对各种破坏劳动纪律的现象进行斗争。巩固劳动纪律正是他们的共同要求和愿望。因此，“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”是有着广泛的群众基础的，错误地认为“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”规定得太严，害怕职工不能接受，这是毫无根据的。假如我们迁就少数落后职工，不敢坚决执行内部劳动规则，必然脱离广大的职工群众；甚至那些少数落后的职工一旦觉悟以后，也会认为这种做法是错误的。当然，我们也必须估计到贯彻内部劳动规则一定会遇到一些困难和阻力，但是只要我们正确地进行一系列的工作，这些困难和阻力是能够克服的。至于是否会犯强迫命令错误的问题，主要在于我们的思想方法和工作方法是否正确。只要我们认真地了解和研究实际情况，根据实际情况去进行工作，并善于提高群众的觉悟程度，教育群众遵守，而不是用粗暴的态度和简单的方式来命令群众遵守，就不会犯强迫命令的错误。
    还有一些同志认为“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”颁布以后，巩固劳动纪律的日常工作就可以结束了。以后只要照章办事就行了，这种说法是不对的。应当知道：要使全体职工自觉地树立共产主义的劳动态度，巩固劳动纪律，在工人阶级内部肃清一切非工人阶级思想影响，绝不是一朝一夕的事情，而是一个长期的艰巨的思想斗争过程。列宁同志说过：“创立新的劳动纪律，创立人与人之间新的社会联系形式，创立吸引人们从事劳动的新形式和新方法，——这是需要有多年的，几十年的工作。”因此绝不能认为“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”颁布以后，便可一劳永逸，万事大吉。我们不仅不能结束巩固劳动纪律的日常工作，而且应该经常地、持久地进行更多的工作，尤其是政治思想工作，只有这样，才能使纲要贯彻执行，使劳动纪律进一步地巩固和加强。
    至于认为纲要颁布以后，说服教育的方法就可以不用或少用了。今后只要加强惩办就可以巩固劳动纪律了。这更是完全错误的。对于少数破坏劳动纪律屡教不改的分子给予适当的处分，是完全必要的，但我们处分职工的目的，不是单纯为了惩办，而是为了惩前毖后，治病救人。是为了教育受处分者本人，为了教育全体职工。巩固劳动纪律的根本方法是教育，只有深入地经常地进行政治思想教育，特别是共产主义教育，才能使劳动纪律成为广大职工群众自觉遵守的纪律。当然，我们并不否定必要的强制手段，对于违反劳动纪律的职工，分别情节的轻重，及时给予适当的处分是完全必要的，尤其对于少数严重破坏劳动纪律屡教不改的分子更应该按其情节的轻重及时地加以适当的处理。但强制手段并非简单地对职工群众实行惩办。列宁同志说过：“就是只有当我们事先能够为强制手段造成说服的基础时，才能正确地和胜利地运用强制手段”。如果在巩固劳动纪律的工作中不是采取说服教育的方针，而是不管大小错误，一律送法院或开除完事，以为简单地处罚一批，开除一批，就可以完成巩固劳动纪律的任务了。这样反而促使部分职工同情被处分者，使我们脱离群众，达不到巩固劳动纪律的目的。
    严格遵守内部劳动规则是中华人民共和国全体工人、工程技术人员和职员的神圣义务。我们应该坚决贯彻“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”，认真学习这个文件，了解其精神实质，彻底纠正各种错误的思想和认识，自觉地遵守劳动纪律，为完成与超额完成国家的生产计划而奋斗。
