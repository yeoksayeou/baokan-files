To inherit and promote this cultural heritage, conscientiously study and research its theories and practical experience, use scientific methods to sort it out and summarize it, and gradually improve its academic and medical level so that it can serve the people more effectively is a glorious and arduous task for China's medical community. Doing this work well will not only greatly help the development and improvement of China's people's health care, but also enrich the content of world medicine.

The Communist Party of China and the People's Government have always attached importance to their motherland's cultural heritage; the Party and the People's Government's policy towards Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has always been clear. The Party has consistently called for unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, to help and encourage each other under the general goal of improving modern medicine and medical standards and better serving the people, and to jointly study and research the motherland's medical heritage so that it can be continuously developed and play a greater role. However, for several years, the leading departments of health administration have not earnestly implemented the Party and the People's Government's policy, nor have they effectively implemented the correct policy of uniting TCM and Western medicine. Although some work has been done and some achievements have been made in mobilizing and organizing TCM practitioners to participate in health and epidemic prevention work and organizing TCM or joint TCM and Western medicine clinics, these works have not fundamentally solved the problem of giving play to the role of TCM, and even less have they taken effective measures in mobilizing and organizing TCM and Western medicine to jointly study and promote the motherland's medical heritage and enrich the content of modern medicine. The leading departments of health administration have even often violated the Party and the People's Government's policy and adopted an attitude of neglecting, discriminating against, and excluding TCM, and adopted various restrictive measures, which has dampened the enthusiasm of TCM practitioners and fostered the wrong mentality among health workers and Western medicine practitioners of neglecting TCM and herbal medicine, seriously affecting the development and improvement of TCM business. Other relevant work departments and public opinion have also not paid enough attention to and cared enough about TCM. These mistakes must be corrected.

The reason why leading health administration cadres cannot implement the Party and the People's Government's policy towards TCM is that they have been poisoned by the remnants of bourgeois ideology and look down on the motherland's medical heritage. They do not understand the importance of inheriting and developing the motherland's cultural heritage for building a new culture, nor do they understand the importance of promoting the motherland's medical heritage for improving modern medicine and medical standards and developing the people's health care, and therefore they do not understand the importance of uniting and improving TCM so that it can fully play its role. They ignore the actual needs of the broad masses of people for TCM and herbal medicine, ignore the rich experience and remarkable curative effects of TCM, and without seriously studying and researching or carefully analyzing and summarizing, they summarily say that TCM is "backward" and "unscientific," and negate it completely. This attitude of not recognizing facts and not valuing practical experience is an extremely "unscientific" arbitrary judgment. The erroneous attitude of leading health administration cadres towards TCM and herbal medicine is a concrete manifestation of serious sectarianism. The fact that this ideological sentiment of neglecting TCM and herbal medicine has not been fundamentally reversed for a long time has made the serious backwardness of TCM work not significantly changed.

Therefore, to effectively improve TCM work, we must first resolutely correct the serious mistake of the leading departments of health administration and other relevant parties in neglecting the motherland's medical heritage and ignoring the health care role of TCM and herbal medicine for the people of our country, and actively call on and organize Western medicine practitioners to study and research TCM. This is the key to solving the problem at present.

The necessity of calling on and organizing Western medicine practitioners to study and research TCM is beyond doubt. Because the arduous task of promoting the motherland's medical heritage can only be gradually completed through long-term cooperation between TCM and Western medicine. The undeniable curative effects of TCM and herbal medicine prove that TCM has reasonable and useful practical content, and its biggest weakness is the lack of systematic scientific theory and the failure to master reliable methods of laboratory tests and scientific examinations, which greatly limits its development and improvement. Therefore, the basic problem of promoting the motherland's medical heritage is how to gradually combine it with modern scientific theory through serious study, research, and practice, that is, to use modern scientific theory and scientific methods to sort out the theory of TCM and summarize its clinical experience, absorb its essence, remove its dross, and gradually merge it with modern medical science to become an important part of modern medical science. We should gradually create such a modernized medicine, which should reflect the characteristics of China's geography and climate, the characteristics of the application of Chinese specialty medicinal materials, and the characteristics of the life and labor of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. This is our long-term goal of promoting the motherland's medical heritage. In order to achieve this goal, TCM practitioners naturally have to make long-term arduous efforts, and Western medicine practitioners with richer scientific knowledge also have a special and glorious responsibility. In today's world where the motherland's medical heritage is not valued and understood by general Western medicine, emphasizing the importance of Western medicine practitioners studying and researching TCM is of particularly great practical significance. Only through the study and research of the motherland's medical heritage can Western medicine practitioners give play to the role of modern medical science knowledge in sorting out and promoting this heritage.

The unity of promoting the motherland's medical heritage and developing modern medical science is completely understandable. Under the joint efforts of TCM and Western medicine, constantly discovering scientific truths from this precious cultural heritage will inevitably enrich the treasure house of modern medical science. In recent years, some Western medicine practitioners have achieved success in studying and researching TCM. For example, the achievements of studying TCM acupuncture therapy based on the scientific theory of neuropathology can illustrate this point. General Western medicine practitioners are only willing to apply those treatments, preventions, and other methods that have a scientific basis in theory and practice, which is correct in one aspect; but they discard the thousands of years of practical experience of TCM and do not discover new knowledge, drugs, and methods from the experience of TCM, which is very wrong. This limits the development of modern medicine itself to a certain extent. For example, in-depth research on acupuncture therapy may write a new page in modern medical theory, and may even require a re-examination of existing theories about the activities of healthy and sick organisms and neural regulation. As long as the research work on TCM and herbal medicine is carried out in a planned, organized, and led manner, it will definitely make a great contribution to modern medical science and people's health care. For individual Western medicine practitioners, using scientific methods to study and research TCM not only does not damage their original medical knowledge and medical skills, but also enriches and improves this knowledge and skills.

Emphasizing the importance of Western medicine practitioners studying and researching TCM does not diminish the great responsibility of the broad masses of TCM practitioners for promoting the motherland's medical heritage. In the past, some TCM practitioners used relatively new perspectives and methods to carry out some sorting out and research work on TCM academics, and achieved many results. But for most TCM practitioners, research work was neglected. This situation should be changed now. In order to strengthen research work with the cooperation of Western medicine, TCM practitioners should not only constantly study TCM theory and master clinical experience, but also learn the necessary basic scientific knowledge in order to play a greater role in sorting out and summarizing TCM theory and practical experience.

In order to effectively unite TCM and Western medicine practitioners to jointly do a good job in promoting the motherland's medical heritage, the leading health administration organs should, in accordance with the spirit indicated by Premier Zhou Enlai in the "Government Work Report," deeply examine the implementation of the Party and the People's Government's policy towards TCM in the past, and effectively correct the wrong attitude towards TCM and herbal medicine. At the same time, they should conduct meticulous ideological work and policy education among Western medicine practitioners, eliminate their ideological obstacles, and on the basis of their conscious and voluntary thinking, stimulate their enthusiasm for studying and researching the motherland's medical heritage. A series of organizational measures should also be taken in a planned and step-by-step manner, and the improvement of TCM work should be guaranteed with the necessary systems and institutions.

Doing this work well is of course a rather complicated matter. The therapies of TCM and Western medicine are different, and to achieve the mutual complementation and convergence of the two, strong ideological and organizational leadership is needed to ensure that they always maintain a high degree of initiative and enthusiasm and strive for a common goal. The principle of linking theory and practice must be implemented, and research work must be carried out from the actual situation and to solve practical problems. The characteristics of TCM and Western medicine, especially the characteristics of TCM, must be taken into account; the initial experience of some medical units in implementing joint TCM and Western medicine consultations must be summarized; and new experiences must be created in a planned and focused manner to guide general work. Reasonable arrangements should be made for their cooperation based on the actual situation of TCM and Western medicine in various places in a realistic manner, so that they can fully play their respective strengths without any concerns in an atmosphere of close cooperation. Only such cooperation can continuously enhance the unity of TCM and Western medicine and effectively carry out the arduous work of promoting the motherland's medical heritage.

TCM work involves a wide range of aspects, and requires not only the active efforts of health administration departments, but also the close cooperation of other relevant departments and the firm support of public opinion, especially the unified leadership of the Party, which is the greatest guarantee for doing this work well. Party committees at all levels must earnestly assume responsibility, constantly guide and supervise all relevant parties to implement the Party's policy towards TCM, and actively improve this important work related to the birth, aging, illness, and death of the people.

### 贯彻对待中医的正确政策

    贯彻对待中医的正确政策
    我国医学有数千年的历史，有丰富的内容和宝贵的临床经验，在我国历代人民对疾病的斗争中发挥了巨大的作用。继承和发扬这份文化遗产，认真学习和研究它的学理和实践经验，用科学方法加以整理和总结，逐步提高它的学术水平和医疗水平，使它更有效地为人民服务，这是我国医学界的一项十分光荣的艰巨任务。做好这一工作，不仅大大有助于我国人民的保健医疗事业的发展和提高，而且能使世界医学的内容更加丰富起来。
    中国共产党和人民政府向来是重视自己祖国的文化遗产的；党和人民政府对中医的政策向来是明确的。党一贯号召中、西医团结合作，在提高现代医学和医疗水平、更好地为人民服务的总目标下互助互勉，共同学习和研究祖国的医学遗产，使它不断地发扬光大，发挥更大的作用。可是几年以来，卫生行政领导部门一直没有认真执行党和人民政府的这一政策，没有切实贯彻团结中、西医的正确方针。固然在动员和组织中医参加卫生防疫工作、组织中医或中、西医联合诊所等方面做了一些工作，取得一些成绩，但这些工作并没有从根本上解决发挥中医的作用的问题，更没有在发动和组织中、西医共同研究和发扬祖国医学遗产、丰富现代医学内容方面采取有效的办法。卫生行政领导部门甚至往往违反党和人民政府的政策，对中医采取轻视、歧视和排斥的态度，采取种种限制的办法，这就打击了中医的工作积极性，助长了卫生工作干部和西医轻视中医中药的错误心理，严重地影响了中医业务的发展和提高。其他有关的工作部门和社会舆论方面对中医也重视不够，关心不够。这些错误必须加以纠正。
    卫生行政领导干部所以不能贯彻执行党和人民政府对中医的政策，就是因为他们中了资产阶级思想的遗毒，看不起祖国的医学遗产的缘故。他们不懂得继承和发展祖国的文化遗产对建设新文化的重要性，不懂得发扬祖国医学遗产对提高现代医学和医疗水平、发展人民保健医疗事业的重要性，因此也不懂得团结和提高中医，使它充分发挥作用的重要性。他们忽视广大人民对中医中药的实际需要，忽视中医的丰富经验和显著疗效，不去认真学习研究，不加仔细分析总结，就笼统地说中医“落后”、
  “不科学”，全盘加以否定。这种不承认事实、不重视实践经验的态度，是极端“不科学”的武断。卫生行政领导干部对待中医中药的这种错误的态度，是严重的宗派主义思想情绪的具体表现。这种轻视中医中药的思想情绪，在长时期内一直没有根本扭转过来，就使中医工作的严重落后情况一直没有显著的改变。
    因此，要切实改进中医工作，首先必须坚决纠正卫生行政领导部门和其他有关方面轻视祖国医学遗产、忽视中医中药对我国人民的保健作用的严重错误，积极号召和组织西医学习研究中医学。这是当前解决问题的关键所在。
    号召和组织西医学习研究中医学的必要性是无庸置疑的。因为发扬祖国医学遗产的艰巨任务，只有通过中、西医的长期合作，才能逐步完成。中医中药的不可否认的疗效，证明了中医学有合理的和有用的实际内容，而它的最大弱点就是缺乏系统的科学理论，还没有掌握化验和科学检查的可靠方法，这就大大限制了它的发展和提高。所以发扬祖国医学遗产的基本问题，就是如何通过认真的学习、研究和实践，逐渐使它和现代科学理论相结合的问题，就是要根据现代科学的理论，用科学方法来整理中医学的学理和总结它的临床经验，吸取它的精华，去掉它的糟粕，使它逐渐和现代医学科学合流，成为现代医学科学的重要组成部分。我们应该逐渐创立这样的现代化医学，它应该反映出中国的地理、气候的特点，反映出中国特产的药材的应用特点，反映出中国各族人民的生活和劳动的特点。这便是我们发扬祖国医学遗产的远大目标。为了达到这个目标，中医自然要作长期的艰苦的努力，而有较丰富的科学知识的西医，也有特殊的光荣责任。在祖国医学遗产不被一般西医所重视和理解的今天，强调西医学习和研究中医学的重要性，更有特别重大的实际意义。西医只有通过对祖国医学遗产的学习和研究，才能发挥现代医学科学知识对整理和发扬这份遗产的作用。
    发扬祖国医学遗产和发展现代医学科学的统一性，是完全可以理解的。在中、西医共同努力之下，不断地从这份宝贵的文化遗产中发掘出科学的真理，必然会使现代医学科学的宝库日益丰富起来。几年来某些西医学习和研究中医学是有成绩的。例如根据神经病理学的科学理论研究中医的针灸疗法的成绩，就可以说明这一点。一般西医只愿意应用那些在理论上和实际上都有科学根据的治疗、预防等方法，这从一方面说来是对的；但他们丢弃了中医学的几千年实际经验，不从中医学的经验中发掘新的知识、药物和方法，那就非常不对了。这样便在一定程度上限制了现代医学本身的发展。例如深入研究针灸疗法，便有可能在现代医学理论上写出新的一页，甚至可能因此要重新审查关于健康人和病人机体活动和神经调节的已有的理论。只要有计划、有组织、有领导地展开对中医中药的研究工作，就一定能够对现代医学科学和人民保健事业作出巨大的贡献。就西医个人来说，用科学方法学习和研究中医学，不仅无损于自己原有的医学知识和医疗技能，而且能使这种知识和技能更加丰富和提高。
    强调西医学习和研究中医学的重要性，并没有减轻广大中医对发扬祖国医学遗产的重大责任。在过去，有些中医用比较新的观点和方法，对中医学术进行了一些整理和研究工作，取得了不少成绩。但对大多数中医来说，研究工作是被忽视的。现在应该改变这种情况。为了在西医的合作下加强研究工作，中医不但要经常钻研中医学理，掌握临床经验，而且要学习必要的基础科学知识，以便在整理和总结中医学理和实践经验中发挥更大的作用。
    为了有效地团结中、西医共同做好发扬祖国医学遗产的工作，卫生行政领导机关应该根据周恩来总理在“政府工作报告”中所指示的精神，深入地检查本部门过去执行党和人民政府对中医的政策的情况，切实纠正对待中医中药的错误态度。同时要在西医中进行细致的思想工作和政策教育，消除他们的思想障碍，在他们的自觉自愿的思想基础上，激发他们学习和研究祖国医学遗产的热情。还要有计划、有步骤地采取一系列的组织措施，用必要的制度和必要的机构来保证中医工作的改进。
    要做好这个工作当然是一件相当复杂的事情。中、西医的疗法不同，要做到二者相辅相成，殊途同归，就需要强有力的思想领导和组织领导，保证他们经常保持高度的主动性和积极性，为共同目标而奋斗。理论和实践联系的原则必须加以贯彻，处处要从实际出发，为解决实际问题而进行研究工作。中、西医的特点，尤其是中医的特点，必须加以照顾；某些医疗单位实行中、西医会诊的初步经验，必须加以总结；并要有计划有重点地创造新的经验，据以指导一般工作。要根据各地中、西医的各方面实际情况，实事求是地为他们的合作做好合理的安排，使他们在亲密合作的气氛中无所顾虑，充分发挥各自的特长。只有这样的合作，才能不断增强中、西医的团结，有效地进行发扬祖国医学遗产的艰巨工作。
    中医工作牵涉面很广，不但需要卫生行政部门的积极努力，而且需要其他各有关部门的紧密配合和社会舆论的坚决支持，特别需要党的统一领导，这是做好这一工作的最大保证。各地党委必须切实负起责任，经常指导和督促各有关方面贯彻执行党对中医的政策，积极改进这个有关人民生老病死的重大工作。
