Xinhua News Agency, 3rd October: H. Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, congratulating China on its National Day. The telegram reads as follows: To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:

	On the occasion of the National Day of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Chairman, please allow me, on behalf of the Albanian people and the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and in my own name, to extend my most heartfelt congratulations to you and, through you, to the fraternal Chinese people.

	In the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the comprehensive assistance of the glorious Soviet Union, the great Chinese people have made tremendous achievements in building a new life and have made significant contributions to consolidating international relations, safeguarding peace, and ensuring international security in the spirit of friendly cooperation among all nations. The constitution adopted by the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has forever affirmed these victories and opened up bright and splendid prospects for consolidating the people's regime and the cause of peaceful national construction.

	The Albanian people are following the astonishingly great achievements made by the Chinese people with great concern and wish the Chinese people even greater achievements in the cause of building their great motherland in the future.

	The common friendship between our two peoples and the great Soviet Union guarantees us new victories in the construction of our motherland and in the struggle for friendship and peace among all nations.

	May the friendship and solidarity existing between our two friendly, fraternal peoples be increasingly consolidated.
