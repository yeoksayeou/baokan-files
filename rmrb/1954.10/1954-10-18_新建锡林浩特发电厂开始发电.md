The first thermal power plant built on the Xilin Gol Grassland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region—the Xilinhot Power Plant—began generating electricity on October 1st. On that day, more than 1,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Xilin Gol League braved the wind and rain to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the power plant. At the meeting, the People's Government of Xilin Gol League presented the power plant with a large silk banner with the words: "The Light of Socialism Illuminates the Xilin Gol Grassland." Representatives of the herdsmen presented the power plant's workers with hadas, milk products, milk wine, felt, lambskins, and fox skins as gifts. Herdsman Bo Alam brought twenty catties of milk wine and ten catties of milk products, traveling more than two hundred li to get there. He filled a silver bowl with milk wine and respectfully offered it to the veteran worker brothers, saying, "Although these gifts are meager, they represent my heart." As early as July, when Bo Alam saw the power plant under construction in Xilinhot, he was reminded of the life of slavery he had lived in this area more than twenty years ago. He thought of the great happiness the power plant would bring to the herdsmen, and when he returned home, he milked his three dairy cows and thirty-odd ewes, accumulating the milk day by day, making milk products and milk wine, preparing to give them to the veteran worker brothers.

At night, the power plant began to generate electricity. Under the bright lights, people sang and danced to their hearts' content until late at night. (Attached picture)

    新建锡林浩特发电厂开始发电
    内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒草原新建的第一座火力发电厂——锡林浩特发电厂在十月一日开始发电。那天锡林郭勒盟各族各界一千多人，冒着风雨赶来参加发电厂的剪彩典礼。会上，锡林郭勒盟人民政府送给发电厂一面大锦旗，上面写着：“社会主义的光芒照亮了锡林郭勒草原”。牧民代表们向建设电厂的职工敬献哈达、奶食、奶酒、毛毡、羔皮、狐皮等礼品。牧民波阿拉木带了二十斤奶酒，十来斤奶食，从二百多里路外赶来，他用银碗盛满奶酒双手敬给工人老大哥说：“东西虽少，这是我的心意。”早在七月波阿拉木到锡林浩特看到正在建筑的发电厂，就记起了二十多年前他在这一带所过的奴隶生活。他想到发电厂将带给牧民很大的幸福，回家就把自己三头乳牛和三十多只母羊的奶挤下来，一天一天积攒着，做出奶食和奶酒，准备送给工人老大哥。
    入夜，发电厂开始发电了，在亮晶晶的灯光下，人们尽情歌舞，直到深夜。（附图片）
