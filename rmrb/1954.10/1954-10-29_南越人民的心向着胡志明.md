    The Hearts of the Southern Vietnamese People are with Ho Chi Minh

    I. The First Gold Star Red Flag Flying Over the Puppet Army Bunker

    In Cao Lanh, Sa Dec Province, southwest of Saigon, there was a bunker held by the Fourth Company of the Bao Dai puppet army. The puppet army company commander was a cruel man who often slaughtered residents around the bunker and hunted down cadres of the democratic government operating nearby. Not long before the ceasefire, this puppet army company commander captured and killed a female cadre of the democratic government and ordered her body to be placed under a pile of stones in front of the bunker. The martyr's blood stained the stones and the ground beneath. The puppet company commander believed that this bloody means would frighten the people and alienate them from the cadres of the democratic government.

    After the ceasefire, this area was designated as a temporary staging area for the Vietnamese People's Army, and the puppet army was to withdraw from there. However, in the days before the puppet army's withdrawal, an unexpected visitor arrived – a middle-aged woman. Dressed in ordinary peasant clothing and carrying a small bundle, she stubbornly asked the puppet soldiers when they would be leaving as soon as she arrived at the bunker. The puppet army company commander asked her why she was inquiring about these things. The woman calmly and composedly told him, "In the first minute after you leave, I will hang the flag of the Democratic Republic here – it is our own flag."

    This simple answer stunned the puppet army company commander. The bloodstains of the martyr he had brutally murdered in front of the bunker had not yet dried. He pointed to the bloodstains and asked in a stern voice, "Aren't you afraid?" But the woman replied in the same calm voice, "If I were afraid, I wouldn't have come." Her composed attitude disconcerted the ruthless bandit. He merely grumbled, "Wait, it's still early!"

    From then on, the woman waited near the bunker, eating the dry food she had brought in her bundle when she was hungry. On the third day, the puppet army in the bunker finally withdrew from the area. The puppet army company commander walked in the front, and not far from the bunker, he turned his head and saw a bright gold star red flag flying over the bunker – it was clearly handmade by the peasant woman. This flag fluttered in the August sky, symbolizing the unwavering determination of the people of southern Vietnam.

    II. "Support the One on the Ground! Oppose the One on the Wall!"

    De Hoa, only a dozen kilometers west of Saigon, had been garrisoned by many French and Bao Dai puppet troops during the war. On the first day of the ceasefire in South Vietnam – August 11th, the people of De Hoa organized a demonstration. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Support Peace" and "Support President Ho Chi Minh." Many blind people who had not left their homes for many years also had their children or grandchildren lead them to participate in the march. The procession marched from the urban area to the suburbs. Many elderly people working in the fields ran to the front of the procession and asked, "Who do you support?" The demonstrators replied, "We support Ho Chi Minh." Upon hearing this, these elderly people excitedly said, "Great, support Ho Chi Minh, we must join in!" They didn't even have time to put down their farm tools before running into the procession. The procession grew larger and larger, quickly gathering several thousand people.

    The people's love for President Ho Chi Minh greatly surprised the puppet regime in De Hoa. Soon, they arranged another "demonstration" in an attempt to get people to "support" the puppet emperor Bao Dai.

    On that day, the puppet police and soldiers forcibly gathered people in a square. The puppet army personnel had prepared portraits in advance, intentionally placing President Ho Chi Minh's portrait on the ground and hanging Bao Dai's portrait on the wall. After the people were forcibly gathered, a puppet army personnel began to lead the chant: "Support Emperor Bao Dai! Oppose Ho Chi Minh!" But the crowd remained silent, and no one followed the chant.

    The surrounding puppet army personnel became enraged. They shouted and yelled, forcing people to chant along. Suddenly, someone in the crowd shouted, "Support the one on the ground! Oppose the one on the wall!" A burst of laughter erupted from the silent crowd, and they repeatedly shouted, "Support the one on the ground! Oppose the one on the wall!" This voice rose higher and higher like the spring tide, drowning out the shouts and curses of the puppet army personnel.

    南越人民的心向着胡志明
    新华社记者　张结
    一、飘扬在伪军碉堡上的第一面金星
        红旗
    在西贡西南的沙沥省高岭，有一个由保大伪军第四连据守的碉堡。伪军连长是一个凶狠成性的人，他经常屠杀碉堡周围的居民和捕杀在附近活动的民主政权的干部。停战以前不久，这个伪军连长捕杀了一个民主政权的女干部，并且命令把尸体压在碉堡前面的石头堆下面，烈士的鲜血染红了石块和下面的土地，伪连长自以为用这种血腥的手段，就可使人民害怕并且和民主政权的干部疏远了。
    停战后，这个地区被划为越南人民军的临时驻扎区，伪军要从那里撤退。但在伪军撤离的前几天，却意外地来了一位中年妇女。她穿着平常的农家妇女的服装，带着一个小包袱。一到碉堡跟前，她便固执地问伪军什么时候离开那里。伪军连长问她为什么要打听这些事。这个妇女安详镇静地告诉他说：“在你们离开后的第一分钟，我要在这里挂上民主共和国的国旗——那是我们自己的国旗。”
    这简单的答话把伪军连长惊呆了。在碉堡前面被他惨杀的烈士的血迹还没有干，他指着血迹厉声地问道：“你不怕吗？”但那位妇女却用同样安详的声音回答：“怕，我就不来了。”她的镇静的态度使这个杀人不眨眼的匪徒慌乱了。他只是咕哝着：“你等着吧，还早呢！”
    从此这位妇女便一直守候在碉堡跟前，饿了就拿出包袱里的干粮来吃。第三天，碉堡的伪军终于撤出这个地区。伪军连长在最前面走着，离开碉堡不远，他一回头却发现碉堡上出现了一面鲜艳的金星红旗——它显然是农家妇女手制的，这面旗在八月的天空里迎风飘扬，象征着越南南部人民永不动摇的决心。
    二、“拥护地上的！反对墙上的！”
    西贡以西不过十几公里的德和，在战争期间一直驻有很多法军和保大伪军。南越停战的第一天——八月十一日，德和人民组织了一次示威游行。游行的人们高呼着“拥护和平”“拥护胡志明主席”的口号。许多好多年不出门的瞎了眼睛的人，也让他们的孩子或孙子牵着手参加游行。游行的队伍从城区走到城郊。很多在田地里工作的老年人跑到队伍跟前问：“你们拥护谁？”游行的人们回答：“我们拥护胡志明。”这些老年人一听就兴高采烈地说：“好啊，拥护胡志明，我们一定要参加。”他们来不及放下农具，便跑进队伍里去了。游行队伍越来越大，很快便汇合了好几千人。
    人民热爱胡志明主席的情绪，使德和的伪政权大吃一惊。不久，他们便布置了另一次“游行”，企图让人们“拥护”傀儡皇帝保大。
    那一天，伪军警把人们强迫集中到一个广场上。伪军人员事先并准备了画像。有意把胡志明主席的像放在地上，把保大的像挂在墙上。当人们被强迫集中以后，一个伪军人员便开始带头喊口号：“拥护保大皇帝！反对胡志明！”但人群沉默着，没有一个人跟着喊。
    周围的伪军人员恼羞成怒了。他们乱吵乱叫，强迫人们跟着叫喊。突然人丛中有人高呼一声：“拥护地上的！反对墙上的！”沉默的人群中立刻爆发出一阵欢笑声，他们一次又一次地喊着：“拥护地上的！反对墙上的！”这声音像春潮一样愈来愈高昂，它淹没了伪军人员的叫骂声。
