    Yonggong Township United Agricultural Production Cooperative in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, rarely planted rapeseed in the past, and mostly relied on the state for its oil supply. This year, in response to the government's call to strive for self-sufficiency and surplus in edible oil, the cooperative has expanded its rapeseed planting area more than ninefold compared to last year.

    Last year, the entire cooperative, with twenty-one households, only planted 0.99 mu of rapeseed, harvesting 103 jin. The rapeseed oil extracted was only enough to eat for two and a half months, and the produced oil cake only accounted for 4% of the required amount. This year, the cooperative members responded to the government's call and formulated a plan to expand the rapeseed field to 10.9 mu.

    After the plan was formulated, the entire cooperative actively carried out preparatory work for rapeseed and other winter crop planting. They are already prepared. Seventeen of the cooperative's twenty-one manure ponds are full. They have also accumulated 40,000 jin of green manure, 60,000 jin of foot manure, and more than 3,000 jin of plant ash. In addition, they plan to adopt advanced intensive cultivation methods for all 5.4 mu of rapeseed planted in the two-season fields, and intercrop the rest with broad beans and peas, achieving deep plowing and appropriate close planting.

    内江县永共乡联合农业合作社扩大油菜种植面积九倍多
    四川省内江县永共乡联合农业生产合作社往年很少种菜籽，吃油大部靠国家供应，今年响应政府号召，争取食油自给和有余，比去年扩大菜籽播种面积九倍多。
    去年全社二十一户人只种了九分九厘菜籽，收了一百零三斤。榨出来的菜油只够吃两个半月，生产出来的枯只占需要量的百分之四。今年，社员们响应政府号召，订出扩大菜籽田至十亩九分的计划。
    计划订出后，全社都在积极进行菜籽和其它小春作物播种前的准备工作。已经准备够了。全社的二十一个粪池有十七个装满。还积了四万斤青草肥、六万斤脚肥、三千多斤草木灰。此外，他们并计划在两季田里种的五亩四分菜籽，全部采用密植先进耕作方法，其余的准备和胡豆、豌豆间种在一起，作到深耕和适当密植。
