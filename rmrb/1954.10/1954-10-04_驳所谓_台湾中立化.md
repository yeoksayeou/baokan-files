Refuting the So-Called "Neutralization of Taiwan"
Wu Quan

Recently, the American aggressive bloc has been clamoring to use force to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, intensifying its support and supply to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out even more rampant harassing and destructive warfare, and plotting to expand the aggressive scope of the Seventh Fleet, posing an even more serious threat to peace and security in the Far East. Public opinion in various countries is increasingly expressing its unease about this and condemning it.

The public opinion of many countries in Asia widely reflects the sympathy and support of the Asian people for the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, which cannot be ignored. Even in countries closely related to the Far Eastern situation, such as Britain, some bourgeois newspapers and social and political figures are able to adopt a sober and independent stance.

However, it cannot be ignored that some fallacies that poison international public opinion are constantly spreading in some countries, especially in Britain. The fallacy of advocating "neutralization of Taiwan" is a deliberate attempt to confuse the public.

Among the proponents of the "neutralization of Taiwan" fallacy, some also verbally admit that Taiwan is Chinese territory. However, acknowledging this indisputable fact is one thing; being willing to act on this fact is another. If one believes that China's sacred territory of Taiwan can be "neutralized," then it cannot be said that he truly respects China's sovereignty over Taiwan. This is a very simple principle, as obvious as the fact that advocating the "neutralization" of Wales in Britain would never be considered respecting British territorial sovereignty.

Therefore, some newspapers, such as the British "Times," have successively published articles attempting to tamper with the historical fact that Taiwan belongs to Chinese territory and openly deny that the "Cairo Declaration" has binding force in international law, in order to create arguments for fallacies such as "neutralization."

Of course, the "Times's" attempt to deceive is very clumsy. Its attempt to postpone the years recorded in history when Taiwan belonged to the Chinese territory to the seventeenth century cannot withstand the verification of historical records, and even so, it still cannot erase the fact that Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. Even Robert Feld's article published in the American "World Telegram and Sun" on September 27 admitted that "Taiwanese are Chinese, and the island is considered part of China, just as Florida is to the United States." The "Times" also wants to erase the "Cairo Declaration," which is even more futile. The "Times" said that "London has never regarded the Cairo Declaration as something binding in international law"; while a spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated on August 25 that "The Cairo Declaration said that Taiwan should be returned to the Chinese government - this has been done," which shows that the British government does not consider the "Cairo Declaration" to be non-binding. Therefore, any attempt to erase China's sacred sovereignty over Taiwan, evade the international obligations of relevant countries, and defend the US occupation of Taiwan is doomed to failure.

The proponents of "Taiwan neutralization" are openly stating that their "Taiwan neutralization" proposition is actually the "neutral policy" of former US President Truman in occupying our Taiwan.

The editorial of the British "News Chronicle" on August 28 expressed its approval of Truman's "neutralization policy," saying that "the US Seventh Fleet is a tool to neutralize Taiwan," and even went so far as to demand such a deal with the United States: "We, together with Australia and New Zealand, should propose to share the task of maintaining order in the Taiwan Strait; as a quid pro quo, we ask for the restoration of Mr. Truman's neutralization policy."

The "News Chronicle" pretends to be serious in saying that President Eisenhower's order issued in February 1953 to continue the occupation of Taiwan was "a fundamental change in the US policy toward Taiwan." The newspaper insists that it is not the continued implementation of the US policy of occupying Taiwan and interfering in China's internal affairs, but rather the "fundamental change" of this policy, that "has created the current danger."

Everyone knows that this "fundamental change" does not exist. Eisenhower and Truman both pursued a policy of preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and occupying Taiwan. The Truman administration had also been supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in carrying out the conspiracy of "counterattacking the mainland" and undermining peace in the Far East under the guise of "neutralization." This has long been no secret. The harassing and destructive warfare of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique against the Chinese mainland has never stopped, which is a powerful proof. US Senator Sparkman admitted in Congress in February 1953 when commenting on Eisenhower's instruction: "As far as I know, the Kuomintang has been conducting attacks all along. Truman's original order in June 1950 was to keep the Kuomintang army neutral on the island of Taiwan itself, but it did not seek to prevent, nor did it prevent Chiang Kai-shek's army from conducting pinprick attacks from the Penghu Islands and Kinmen Island, which are closer to the mainland than Taiwan."

Therefore, it is extremely obvious that the "News Chronicle's" request to "restore Mr. Truman's neutral policy" is to support the US policy of occupying Taiwan and interfering in China's internal affairs. According to a report by reporter Hashi of the American "Christian Science Monitor" on September 15, US "government insiders have little doubt about this: the method of re-neutralizing Taiwan is not only the best way to ensure the continued survival of Nationalist China, but also the only possible way to maintain Chiang (Kai-shek)'s fortress in the current situation." It is no accident that the US aggressive bloc is interested in advocating "Taiwan neutralization" and believes that it will be conducive to its continued occupation of Taiwan and the implementation of its intervention policy to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. Originally, these British "Taiwan neutralization" advocates were offering advice to their American allies. The British "Yorkshire Post" urged the United States, saying that if Taiwan is "neutralized," "world public opinion will turn to their side." Isn't it clear that the "Taiwan neutralization" advocates are trying to deceive the world with the guise of "neutralization," but are actually supporting the US occupation of China's territory of Taiwan?

However, the "Taiwan neutralization" advocates are making every effort to argue that "neutralization" is the only (!) peaceful (!) way to solve the Taiwan issue. They propagate: "For the sake of peace, Taiwan should be neutralized."

So, who is threatening peace? Can Taiwan's "neutralization" achieve peace?

Everyone knows that the United States has consistently instigated the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out harassing warfare against our coastal areas and the mainland. After the Geneva Accords were reached, especially recently, these war activities have intensified. The threat to peace comes from the United States, which is admitted by many people. In some countries, especially in Britain, because they are still following the United States' war policy in many aspects, and they are able to estimate the consequences of following this policy, they cannot but feel particularly uneasy about the adventurous activities of the US war instigators, which is understandable. Even the "Taiwan neutralization" advocates deeply feel that the US policy on the Taiwan issue is increasingly seriously threatening peace in the Far East and the world.

In that case, for the sake of peace, it is necessary to oppose the US occupation of Taiwan and oppose US interference in China's internal affairs. This is the conclusion that anyone who truly wants peace will come to. However, the "Taiwan neutralization" advocates are not like this. They have their own "logic." They advocate taking Taiwan's "neutralization" as a cover, with the United States continuing to occupy Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique continuing to occupy Taiwan, that is, preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, in exchange for "peace." Of course, this argument cannot be recognized by the UN Charter, international law, or even world history. Maintaining the state of one country occupying the territory of another country is to continue to endanger peace. The Taiwan "neutralization" theorists know that their claims are untenable, and therefore, they do not hesitate to spread such threatening rhetoric, saying that the US intervention policy of using force to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan is unchangeable, and if the Chinese people liberate Taiwan, it will cause war. The British "News Chronicle" even openly reversed right and wrong, saying that "today's threat mainly comes from the Communist side," advocating that "the British government can reach an agreement with Washington to make this neutralization an effective international policy" to "strive to explain to the Chinese Communists" not to liberate Taiwan. This makes it clear that these British "neutralization" theorists, "for the sake of peace," are trying to treat the great People's Republic of China in the same way as they used to divide the territory of old China. They are trying to sacrifice China's territorial sovereignty to satisfy the US aggressive desires; and in order to achieve this goal, they even attempt to stand on the US side to put pressure on the Chinese people.

To what extent have these British commentators gone? Don't they understand what kind of ending it will lead to if they encourage the aggressor and try to collude with it?

Obviously, the "Taiwan neutralization" advocates are not pursuing peace, but are encouraging aggression, encouraging war instigators, and causing greater damage to the cause of peace. These advocates play a particularly poisonous role, that is, they want to use the beautiful words of "peace" to divert people's attention, mislead people with good peace wishes, and allow the intervention behavior of the US aggressive bloc to escape the condemnation of world public opinion.

However, everyone knows that after the US aggressive bloc occupied Taiwan, it also appeared with a "peaceful" face, concealing its long-term conspiracy to annex Taiwan and use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to attack our country. The British ruling group and some newspapers at that time supported this so-called "neutral policy." However, the result proved that supporting this so-called "neutral policy" was to encourage the United States to promote a policy of undermining peace in the Far East step by step in Taiwan, which was contrary to consolidating peace in the Far East. Eisenhower's belief in February 1953 that it was no longer necessary to put on this "neutralization" fig leaf was the logical development of this so-called "neutral policy." From the aggressors, when he thinks that it is no longer necessary to pretend to be "peaceful," or when this disguise can no longer deceive anyone, he will show his true colors. Now, the British "Taiwan neutralization" theorists insist that it would be conducive to peace if the United States re-clad this "neutralization" fig leaf, isn't it a great mockery!

There is no doubt that the "peace" words of the "Taiwan neutralization" advocates are not at all attractive, and this fallacy is completely untenable. British public opinion and far-sighted politicians can recognize from countless historical lessons that this "neutralization" proposition is not only not conducive to peace, but also does not conform to British interests.

As for some people saying that Taiwan is not forever "neutralized," but "neutralized for a period of time," is this okay? Of course not. Because, no matter how long or short the "neutralization" period is, it is disrespectful to China's territorial sovereignty and an encouragement to the aggressor. The person who advocates "neutralization for a period of time" absurdly believes that whether Taiwan "re-merges with the mainland" is "freely decided by the people on this island." However, who doesn't know that Taiwan is under the control of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and the people of Taiwan have no freedom at all. Isn't the result to let the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique decide Taiwan's fate? Isn't this using "neutralization for a period of time" to legalize the US occupation of Taiwan? It is a well-known fact that Taiwan compatriots have made unremitting struggles to oppose aggression and return to the embrace of the motherland; however, it is also a well-known fact that they are still ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and enslaved by the US aggressors. Why do those who pretend to value the "free decision" of the Taiwanese people deliberately pretend not to see these facts that are seen by everyone?

Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The United States is not allowed to interfere, and the United States is not allowed to occupy Taiwan. This is a matter of course. Any ideas and practices that obstruct this just cause will only benefit the enemies of peace, and therefore are very harmful. "Taiwan neutralization" is such a harmful fallacy. It attempts to separate China's territory and legalize the US occupation of Taiwan, so it must be refuted and resolutely opposed to the end.

    驳所谓“台湾中立化”
    吴全
    最近，美国侵略集团扬言要以武力阻挠中国人民解放台湾，加紧支持和供应蒋介石卖国集团进行更加猖獗的骚扰性和破坏性战争，并阴谋扩大第七舰队的侵略范围，使远东和平和安全受到更加严重的威胁。各国舆论越来越强烈地对此表示不安，并纷纷加以谴责。
    亚洲许多国家的舆论，广泛地反映了亚洲人民对中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争的同情和支持，这是不容漠视的。就是在与远东局势有着密切关系的国家里，如在英国，有些资产阶级报刊和社会政界人士也能够采取清醒的和独立的立场。
    但是，人们也不能不注意到，一些毒害国际舆论的谬论，正在若干国家里，特别是在英国，不断地传播开来。主张“台湾中立化”的谬论，就是一种别有用心的力图混淆视听的谬论。
      “台湾中立化”的谬论的鼓吹者中，有人也在口头上承认台湾是中国的领土。但是，承认这一无可辩驳的事实是一回事；是否愿意从这一事实出发行事，又是一回事。如果认为中国的神圣领土台湾可以“中立化”，那就不能说他真正尊重中国对台湾的主权。这个道理是十分浅显的，正如主张英国的威尔士“中立化”决不会被人认为是尊重英国领土主权一样的明显。
    因此，有些像英国“泰晤士报”那样的报纸，就接连发表文章，企图篡改台湾属于中国领土的历史事实，并公然否认“开罗宣言”在国际法上具有约束力，以便替“中立化”之类的谬论创立论据。
    当然，“泰晤士报”的遮眼法是十分拙劣的。它要把史册记载的台湾属于中国版图的年代，推迟到十七世纪，是经不起历史记录的对证的，而且即使这样，也还是无法抹煞台湾自古是中国的领土。甚至九月二十七日美国“世界电讯与太阳报”登载的罗伯特·费尔德一文，也承认“台湾人是中国人，而且该岛之被人认为是中国之一部，正如弗罗里达州之于美国一样。”“泰晤士报”又想把“开罗宣言”一笔勾销，更是枉费力气。“泰晤士报”说，
  “伦敦从未把开罗宣言当作在国际法上具有约束力的东西”；而英国外交部发言人却在八月二十五日表示，“开罗宣言说，台湾应归还中国政府——这一点已经做到了”，可见英国政府并不认为“开罗宣言”没有约束力。所以，任何人企图抹煞中国对台湾的神圣主权，推卸有关国家的国际义务，替美国侵占台湾的行为作辩护，都是要失败的。
      “台湾中立化”的鼓吹者正在公开地表明，他们的“台湾中立化”主张，实际上就是美国前总统杜鲁门侵占我国台湾的“中立政策”。
    八月二十八日的英国“新闻纪事报”社论，就表示赞同杜鲁门的“中立化政策”，说什么“美国第七舰队是一个使台湾中立化的工具”，甚至不惜要求和美国进行这样一笔交易：“我们和澳大利亚、新西兰一起，应该提议分担维持台湾海峡的秩序的任务；作为一种国报，我们要求的是，恢复杜鲁门先生的中立化政策”。
      “新闻纪事报”像煞有介事地说什么美国总统艾森豪威尔在一九五三年二月颁布的继续侵占台湾的命令，是“在美国对台湾的政策上作了根本性的改变”。这个报纸硬说，不是美国侵占台湾、干涉中国内政的政策的继续执行，而是这个政策的“根本性改变”，“产生了当前的危险”。
    谁都知道，这个“根本性的改变”是不存在的。艾森豪威尔和杜鲁门都是执行阻止中国人民解放台湾和侵占台湾的政策。杜鲁门政府也一直就在
  “中立化”的幌子下，支持蒋介石卖国集团进行“反攻大陆”、破坏远东和平的阴谋计划。这早已不是什么秘密。蒋介石卖国集团对中国大陆的骚扰性和破坏性战争，从来也没有停止过，这就是有力的证明。美国参议员斯派克曼在一九五三年二月的国会上评论艾森豪威尔的训令时就承认：“据我所知，国民党已经一直在进行袭击了。一九五○年六月杜鲁门原来的命令是要国民党军队在台湾岛本身保持中立，但它并不求得阻止、也没有阻止住蒋介石军队从比台湾更近大陆的澎湖列岛以及金门岛进行针刺式的袭击。”
    所以，极为显然，“新闻纪事报”要求“恢复杜鲁门先生的中立政策”，也就是支持美国侵占台湾、干涉中国内政的政策。据九月十五日美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者哈希的报道，美国“政府内部人士不大怀疑这件事：再度使台湾中立化的办法不仅是保证国民党中国继续生存下去的最好的办法，而且也是在目前实际情况下保持蒋（介石）这一要塞的唯一可能的办法”。美国侵略集团对“台湾中立化”的鼓吹会感到兴趣，并认为会有利于它继续侵占台湾，并执行阻止中国人民解放台湾的干涉政策，这完全不是偶然的事。原来，英国的这些“台湾中立化”鼓吹者就是在向他们的美国盟友献策。英国“约克郡邮报”就敦促美国说，如把台湾“中立化”，“将使世界舆论转向他们那一边”。“台湾中立化”的鼓吹者居心要用“中立化”的幌子来欺骗世人，实际上却支持美国侵占中国的领土台湾，不是明明白白的事吗？
    但是，“台湾中立化”的鼓吹者们却竭力辩解说，“中立化”是解决台湾问题的唯一的（！）和平（！）途径。他们宣传：“为了和平，应当把台湾中立化。”
    那么，究竟是谁在威胁着和平？台湾“中立化”又能否取得和平呢？
    人人知道，美国一贯指使蒋介石卖国集团对我国沿海和大陆进行骚扰战争。日内瓦协议达成以后，特别是最近，这些战争活动更为加紧。对和平的威胁来自美国，这是许多人都承认的。在一些国家里，特别是在英国，由于它们在许多方面仍旧追随着美国的战争政策，而它们又是能够估计到追随这个政策的后果的，因此，它们对美国战争挑拨者的冒险活动，不能不特别感到不安，这是可以理解的。就是“台湾中立化”的鼓吹者也是深切地感到，美国关于台湾问题的政策，正在日益严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平。
    既然如此，为了和平，那么，就必须反对美国侵占台湾，反对美国干涉中国内政。这是任何真正为了和平的人，都会得出来的结论。可是，“台湾中立化”的鼓吹者们却不是这样。他们有自己的
  “逻辑”。他们主张以台湾“中立化”为掩护，由美国继续侵占台湾，蒋介石卖国集团继续盘踞台湾，也就是阻止中国人民解放台湾，来换取“和平”。当然，这种论调不能为联合国宪章、国际公法甚至世界历史所承认。保持一个国家侵占另一国家的领土的状态就是继续危害和平。台湾“中立化”论者深知自己的主张站不住脚，因此，不惜散布这样的威胁论调，说什么美国以武力阻挠中国人民解放台湾的干涉政策是不可改变的，如果中国人民解放台湾，就会引起战争。英国“新闻纪事报”甚至公然颠倒是非，说什么“今天的威胁主要来自共产党方面”，主张“英国政府可以和华盛顿取得一致使这种中立化成为一个有效的国际政策，”来“努力向中国共产党说明”不要解放台湾。这就再清楚不过，英国的这些“为了和平”的“中立化”论者，是妄想用过去分割旧中国领土的办法来对待伟大的中华人民共和国。他们妄想牺牲中国的领土主权，来满足美国的侵略欲望；而且为了达到这一目的，竟企图站在美国一边对中国人民施加压力。
    英国的这些评论家到了什么地步了呢？难道他们还不明白怂恿侵略者，并想和它勾结在一起，会导向怎样的结局吗？
    很显然，“台湾中立化”的鼓吹者不是在追求和平，而是在鼓励侵略，鼓励战争挑拨者，使和平事业受到更大的损害。这些鼓吹者起着特殊有毒的作用，就是他们想用“和平”的动听词句，来转移人们的注意力，使怀抱善良的和平愿望的人们误入歧途，使美国侵略集团的干涉行为逃脱世界公众舆论的指责。
    但是，谁都知道，美国侵略集团侵占台湾后，也是以“和平”的面目出现，掩藏其长期并吞台湾和利用蒋介石卖国集团进攻我国的阴谋活动。英国的统治集团和一些报刊，当时是支持这个所谓“中立政策”的。但是，结果证明支持这个所谓“中立政策”，就是鼓励美国一步紧一步地在台湾推行破坏远东和平的政策，就是与巩固远东和平背道而驰。一九五三年二月艾森豪威尔认为不需要再披上这块“中立化”的遮羞布，就是这个所谓“中立政策”的逻辑的发展。从来的侵略者，当他认为到了不必伪装“和平”面目的时候，或是这种伪装已经骗不了什么人的时候，就会显露原形。现在，英国的
  “台湾中立化”论者却硬说美国如果重新披上这块
  “中立化”的遮羞布那就会有利于和平，岂不是莫大的嘲讽么！
    毫无疑问，“台湾中立化”的鼓吹者的“和平”词句，是没有半点吸引力的，这种谬论是完全站不住脚的。英国公众舆论和有远见的政治家，都能够从无数的历史教训中认识到：这种“中立化”的主张，不仅不利于和平，而且也不符合英国的利益。
    至于有人说，台湾并不永远“中立化”，而是“中立化一个时期”，这是不是行呢？当然，也不行。因为，“中立化”的时期不管长短，都是不尊重中国的领土主权，都是对侵略者的鼓励。主张“中立化一个时期”的人，就荒谬地认为台湾是否“重新和大陆合并”，由“这个岛上的人民自由决定”。可是，谁不知道台湾是在蒋介石卖国集团的控制下，台湾人民没有任何自由可言，结果难道不是叫美国和蒋介石卖国集团来决定台湾的命运吗？难道这不是用“中立化一个时期”来使美国侵占台湾成为合法化吗？台湾同胞曾为反对侵略、重回祖国怀抱，作了不懈的斗争，这是谁都知道的事实；但是，他们现在依然受到蒋介石卖国集团的统治和美国侵略者的奴役，也是谁都知道的事实。那些装作重视台湾人民的“自由决定”的人，为什么却故意对这些人所共见的事实当作不看见呢？
    台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾，不容许美国干涉，不容许美国侵占台湾。这是天经地义的事。任何阻挠这个正义事业的想法和做法，都只有利于和平的敌人，因而是十分有害的。
  “台湾中立化”就是这样一个有害的谬论，它企图割裂中国的领土，使美国侵占台湾的行为合法化，所以，必须驳斥它，必须坚决反对它到底。
