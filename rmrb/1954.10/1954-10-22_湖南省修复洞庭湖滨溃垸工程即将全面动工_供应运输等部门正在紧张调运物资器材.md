The massive project to repair breached dikes along the banks of Dongting Lake in Hunan Province will fully commence in early November. The province's supply, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and health departments are actively and tensely transferring materials and equipment in preparation for the start of this project.

As of October 7th, the province had organized and allocated 150,000 tons of sailboats and over 50 ships exclusively for the transportation of lake management materials and equipment. Over 70,000 tons of construction materials like rice straw, bark, and nan bamboo, over 230,000 tons of staple and non-staple foods like rice, cooking oil, vegetables, salt, and soybeans, over 117,000 tons of engineering materials like baskets, shoulder poles, and stone rollers, and over 200,000 tons of steel, wire, cement, and other gate construction materials are being rushed to the construction sites from various locations.

To support the people in the lake area, many supply and marketing cooperatives in the mountainous and hilly regions of the province had already begun processing and purchasing lake management materials and equipment around September 10th. The Taoyuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office transferred over 300 full-time cadres across the county to form a strong purchasing team for lake management equipment. Lake management equipment purchasing offices were established from the county to the districts. The county established a total of 74 purchasing stations. Starting in late September, they planned to purchase over 42 million catties of rice straw, vegetables, etc., and over 1.7 million pieces of baskets and nan bamboo. The first batch of purchased equipment has already been transported to the lake area construction sites. Supply and marketing cooperatives in the Dongting Lake area are also actively processing and purchasing materials and equipment needed for the project. The Anxiang County Cooperative General Office is organizing the processing of 60,000 loads of baskets. As of October 1st, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Nan County had organized more than 830 professional and sideline basket weavers to produce more than 18,000 loads of baskets. The county guarantees that it will complete the task of 300,000 loads of baskets before the end of October.

The province's grain departments are also transporting large quantities of rice to the lake area construction sites. Of the 25 million catties of rice being processed and milled in Changsha City, 17 million catties had already been transported to the lake area construction sites by October 15th. In the work of processing and milling rice, the workers of the Changsha City rice mills demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary camaraderie. In addition to working seven hours at night, they also worked overtime for two hours at noon during the day.

The Hunan Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration has also organized personnel to install telecommunications equipment for the construction sites. According to the plan requirements, 1,000 kilometers of new telephone lines need to be erected at the construction sites within October, 24 telephone switchboards and 120 telephone extensions need to be installed, as well as three radio stations. Engineering, surveying, reporting, and supply personnel have been transferred from the postal and telecommunications organizations and basic construction sites in Changsha, Hengyang, Xiangtan, and other cities to participate in this work. These employees are heading to Changsha City to report with great enthusiasm.

Health departments at all levels have transferred and organized more than 1,500 medical personnel to support the lake management project for the people along the lake. More than 250 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have also actively participated in this work. The Provincial Health Department has purchased a large quantity of traditional Chinese medicine and prepared medicines for the prevention and treatment of colds, dysentery, frostbite, and other ailments from the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation in Changsha City. It also plans to transport 200 steel beds, two small X-ray machines, and a large quantity of medical equipment for internal medicine, surgery, and orthopedics from Changsha City to the lake area construction sites. Eight hospitals have been established at the construction sites in Caowei in Yuanjiang County and Xiaojiawan in Nan County, and medical personnel have been properly assigned. Medical equipment and pharmaceuticals have begun to be transported from Changsha City to the construction sites.
