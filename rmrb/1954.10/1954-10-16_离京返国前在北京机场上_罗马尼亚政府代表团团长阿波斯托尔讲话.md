    Romanian Government Delegation Head Apostol's Speech at Beijing Airport Before Leaving for Home
    Dear Comrades and Friends:
    It is a great honor for our delegation to be able to represent the Romanian people, the government of the Romanian People's Republic, and the Romanian Workers' Party in participating in the great national celebration of the Chinese people—the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    The delegation would like to express its heartfelt and sincere gratitude to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government, for the warm welcome and brotherly and friendly treatment we received in the cities, factories, rural areas, and arts and cultural institutions we visited.
    We were thrilled to see the great achievements of the creative labor of the hardworking and wise Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its beloved leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, during our visits to the glorious capital of the People's Republic of China and throughout China.
    The review of the people's power held in Beijing and various cities across the country on October 1st showed us that the Chinese people, led by the heroic working class, are firmly united with boundless enthusiasm and conviction in the people's democratic front. In the cause of building a new socialist life, in the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world, they are following the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government in realizing the nation's lofty aspiration—achieving the liberation of all Chinese territory!
    The great friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and the fraternal cooperation among all the people in the entire peace, democracy, and socialism camp, constitute an invincible force for safeguarding the cause of peace and the progress of mankind.
    We were deeply moved everywhere by the Chinese people's profound friendship towards the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.
    As we are about to return to our homeland, we sincerely wish the great Chinese people complete victory in fulfilling the tasks of its first great five-year plan, in the construction of the new China, and in its struggle to defend the cause of peace.
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the great Chinese people and the Romanian people!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great Chinese people!
    Long live the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, led by the Soviet Union!
