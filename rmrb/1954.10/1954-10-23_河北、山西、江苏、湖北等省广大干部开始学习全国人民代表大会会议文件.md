    Broad Cadres in Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei and Other Provinces
    Begin to Study the Documents of the National People's Congress
    The broad cadres of Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Hubei provinces have begun to study the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong's opening speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, and other documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress.

    Before starting the study, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on conveying, studying, and publicizing the documents to state organ personnel at all levels in Hebei Province. On the afternoon of October 16th, Lin Tie, representative to the National People's Congress and Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report on the achievements of the First Session of the First National People's Congress at an enlarged cadre meeting of all counties and above in the province and a meeting attended by responsible cadres from provincial departments convened by the Provincial Party Committee. The province will also organize Party reporters and cadres going down to factories and villages to conduct reports to the broad cadres, party members, and people at the grassroots level by factories and mines, by streets, and by villages.

    In Shanxi Province, in addition to the cadres at all levels who have been studying theory and culture in the past, teachers and students of secondary schools and above, and primary school teachers are also participating in this study. While reading the documents and discussing them, the participants in various places, in accordance with the spirit of the documents, closely combined the actual situation of the local area and the main problems in the cadres' thinking, and conducted appropriate analysis and criticism to improve the cadres' socialist consciousness and strengthen the concept of abiding by the constitution, laws, and discipline, and establish a correct working attitude and working style.

    In Jiangsu Province, after the cadres of provincial-level organs began to study on the 11th, they are now discussing Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Cadres of Nanjing municipal organs, various factories and enterprises, state-owned trading units, and hospital staff have read Chairman Mao's opening speech and Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution, and have begun discussions.

    Cadres of organs directly under the Hubei provincial government and cadres at and above the county level in various parts of the province began to read the documents successively from the 16th. In its instructions on this study, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requested that all localities closely integrate the study with the current central tasks. The cadres of the Wuhan Municipal Intermediate Study Group, while studying Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, focused on studying the parts of the report related to the work of their departments, in order to clarify the policies and guidelines of their departments' work and future tasks, so as to improve current work and promote increased production and economy.
