Southern Sichuan Basin Proven Rich in Natural Gas

The southern part of the Sichuan Basin has been preliminarily confirmed as a rich natural gas field. Natural gas, also known as gaseous petroleum, can be used to manufacture carbon black, an important raw material for the rubber industry, and can also be used to manufacture synthetic gasoline.

With the assistance of Soviet experts, oil drilling work in the southern Sichuan Basin has been underway for more than a year, and two oil exploration wells have been drilled. After the first exploration well was completed in mid-May this year, preliminary oil testing confirmed that it contained abundant, high-quality natural gas. When oil testing began on the second exploration well after it was completed at the end of July, natural gas gushed out of the well in large quantities. Currently, in addition to the second exploration well which is still undergoing oil testing, the first exploration well has been supplying a carbon black factory for carbon black production since September. The natural gas gushing from this well has very little sulfur content, which can reduce the difficulty of desulfurization in the carbon black manufacturing process, resulting in high-quality carbon black while also saving costs.

    四川盆地南部天然气含量丰富
    四川盆地南部已初步证实是一个含量丰富的天然气田。天然气又名气体石油，它可以制造橡胶工业的重要原料——碳黑，也可以制造合成汽油。
    四川盆地南部的石油钻探工作一年多来在苏联专家帮助下，已钻好了两口石油探井。第一口探井在今年五月中旬钻探完毕后，经过初步试油测定，证实含有丰富的质量好的天然气。第二口探井在七月底钻探完毕后开始试油时，天然气就从井内大量喷出。目前，除第二口探井还在继续试油外，第一口探井从九月起已开始供应碳黑厂制造碳黑。这口井喷出的天然气，含硫量很少，可以减少制造碳黑过程中脱硫的困难，制出的碳黑质量既好又节约成本。　　　　（新华社）
