    The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party held a meeting on the 5th and decided to issue instructions to local organizations of the China Zhi Gong Party at all levels, calling on all members to study the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress.
    The instructions stated: The First Session of the First National People's Congress solemnly adopted and promulgated the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. In addition to rejoicing and being encouraged by this, we must take concrete actions to implement the Constitution and express our heartfelt support for it.
    The instructions require organizations at all levels to immediately organize members to study the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao's opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress, Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report.
    The instructions stated: We must faithfully abide by the Constitution and strive to complete the country's socialist construction. In our studies, we must closely link theory with practice, combining it with the current political task of liberating Taiwan and other construction tasks, as well as the further development of socialist transformation of members and the masses they are connected with, and overseas Chinese affairs work. At the same time, we must also publicize the Constitution to the broad masses of the people so that they can all deeply understand, support, and implement it. In this study, we must more deeply recognize that the Chinese Communist Party is the victorious leader and organizer, resolutely follow the Communist Party, and resolutely take the socialist road.
