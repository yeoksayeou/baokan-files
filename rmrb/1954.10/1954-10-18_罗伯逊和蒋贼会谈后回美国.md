Xinhua News Agency, 15th: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Walter Robertson has returned to Washington on the 14th after holding three secret meetings in Taiwan with the head of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Robertson's statement upon leaving Taiwan shows that his activities in Taiwan were to implement the U.S. policy of continuing to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as a tool for aggression against China and disruption of peace in the Far East. He said in his statement that the meetings examined the military and economic situation of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and discussed "various issues related to the nature and scope of the aid program for the current and future fiscal years." He also revealed that the meetings also "studied the situation in the entire Far East region and exchanged views on how to deal with various problems in the region."

According to Western news agencies, in the talks between Robertson and the Chiang Kai-shek traitor, the United States "has promised to accelerate the delivery of aid to the Kuomintang" and assured that the United States "has an obligation" to protect Taiwan and other coastal islands occupied by the Chiang bandits. Agence France-Presse revealed that this U.S. "guarantee" is related to the long-planned U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique "bilateral common security treaty."

    罗伯逊和蒋贼会谈后回美国
    【新华社十五日讯】美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在台湾和蒋介石卖国集团的头目进行了三次秘密会谈以后，已在十四日离台湾回华盛顿。罗伯逊在离台湾时发表的声明表明，他到台湾活动是为了执行美国继续支援蒋介石卖国集团作为侵略中国和破坏远东和平的工具的政策。他在声明中说，会谈中研究了蒋介石卖国集团军事和经济方面的情况，并且讨论了“目前和未来财政年度的援助计划的性质和范围有关的各项问题”。他又透露，会谈中也“研究了整个远东地区的局势，并对应付这个地区的各项问题的方法交换了意见”。
    据西方通讯社透露，在罗伯逊和蒋介石卖国贼会谈中，美国“已答应加速把援助运给国民党”，并保证美国“有义务”来庇护台湾及其他蒋贼盘据的沿海岛屿。法新社透露，这一项美国“保证”和策划已久的美国—蒋介石卖国集团“共同安全双边条约”有关。
