Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 30th: The Thin Plate Department of the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which comprehensively completed this year's annual production plan three months and seven days ahead of schedule, exceeded its original October production plan by 17.5% as of October 27th. To date, the Thin Plate Department has exceeded this year's national production plan by more than 14%. According to the figures already calculated, the department's costs from January to September were 5.6% lower than the national planned target, the product qualification rate was 4.46% higher than planned, and labor productivity also exceeded the national plan by 10.89%.

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Thin Plate Department's excellent completion of this year's production plan is the result of the entire workforce conscientiously implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts over the past ten months. In the past, the Thin Plate Department suffered from poor maintenance of rolling stock, resulting in low utilization rates, which greatly affected product quality and output. This March, Soviet experts Karlov and others came to the plant and successively offered the department's workers a series of suggestions for improving technical operations, such as correctly mastering the temperature of the heating furnace, brushing iron scale, and using picking devices. The department's technical leadership then taught these suggestions to workers through the existing five spare-time technical learning classes and incorporated some recurring suggestions into the operating procedures for rolling thin plates, ensuring the thorough implementation of 55 suggestions from Soviet experts. The utilization rate of rolling stock increased by 2.9 times compared to the past. The implementation of several technical measures for maintaining rolling stock ensured the normal curve of the rolling stock, improving product quality. The average proportion of first-class products for various specifications of thin plates increased from over 30% in the past to over 94%.

In October, the Thin Plate Department conducted a comprehensive review of the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions since the beginning of the year. Now, the workers are further implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, working intensely to exceed the annual production plan by 25.67% by the end of the year, and to increase production and savings for the country by 22 billion yuan for the whole year.

    认真贯彻苏联专家的建议
    太原钢铁厂薄板部提前完成全年生产计划
    【新华社太原三十日电】　提前三个月另七天全面完成今年全年生产计划的国营太原钢铁厂薄板部，到十月二十七日又超额百分之十七点五完成了原订十月份生产计划。至此，薄板部执行今年全年国家生产计划已超过百分之十四。据已经核算出来的数字，这个部一至九月的成本比国家计划指标降低百分之五点六，产品合格率比计划提高百分之四点四六，劳动生产率也超过国家计划百分之十点八九。
    太原钢铁厂薄板部今年的生产计划完成得这样好，是全体职工在过去十个月中认真贯彻苏联专家建议的结果。过去，薄板部因为轧辊维护不好，使用率很低，产品的质量和产量受到很大影响。今年三月，苏联专家卡尔洛夫等来厂，先后向这个部的职工提出了正确掌握加热炉温度、刷铁鳞、采用挑齐器等一系列改进技术操作的建议。这个部的技术领导部门就把这些建议通过已有的五个业余技术学习班教给工人，并把一些经常性的建议订入轧制薄板的操作规程中去，使五十五项苏联专家的建议得到彻底执行。轧辊使用率就比过去提高了二点九倍。若干维护轧辊的技术措施的推行，保证了轧辊的曲线正常，使产品质量提高。各种规格薄板的一级品所占的比率，平均由过去的百分之三十多提高到百分之九十四以上。
    十月份，薄板部对今年以来贯彻苏联专家建议工作又进行了一次全面的检查。现在，职工们正进一步贯彻苏联专家的建议，为争取到年终超过全年生产计划百分之二十五点六七，为全年给国家增产节约二百二十亿元而紧张地劳动着。
