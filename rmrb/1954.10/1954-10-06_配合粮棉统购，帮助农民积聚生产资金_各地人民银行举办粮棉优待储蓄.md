   In Coordination with the Unified Purchase of Grain and Cotton, Helping Farmers Accumulate Production Funds
   People's Banks in Various Regions Organize Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings
    [From Our Newspaper] The unified purchase of autumn grain and cotton is about to be launched in various regions. In order to help the broad masses of farmers properly manage the remaining funds after selling grain and cotton, and to systematically accumulate funds for production, People's Banks in various regions are preparing to launch "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings."
    Last winter and this spring, the "Preferential Grain Sales Savings" organized by the People's Bank was welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. In three months, the total amount of savings reached more than 4.2 trillion yuan. During this year's spring plowing production, People's Banks in various regions generally strengthened redemption work, and promptly delivered the savings and generous interest to the farmers, strongly supporting farmers' production. At that time, many farmers expressed their intention to deposit their remaining funds in the state bank after selling grain and cotton this year. This year's "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" still stipulates generous interest rates: for deposits of one to three months, the monthly interest rate is 1.2%; for four to six months, the monthly interest rate is 1.5%. In order to facilitate farmers' deposits and withdrawals, there will be many improvements in the deposit and redemption procedures this year. For example, the "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" deposit slips generally adopt the "fixed-term, fixed-amount" method, with various installment and amount deposit slips pre-printed, eliminating the need for temporary filling during deposits. This year, in addition to trying to increase the number of deposit stations, People's Banks in various regions will also widely entrust credit cooperatives and grain purchasing stations to handle deposit and redemption services.
    At present, People's Banks in various regions have generally actively carried out preparations for "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings." Branches of the People's Bank of China in Jiangxi, Sichuan, Shandong, Shaanxi, and more than ten other provinces and cities have formulated specific measures for organizing "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings." In many areas of Gansu Province, People's Banks have carried out savings reservation work, and many farmers have planned to deposit more than 50% of their grain sales proceeds into the bank. In Jin County, Liaoning Province, and other places, many People's Banks have trained cadres to carry out "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" work.

   配合粮棉统购，帮助农民积聚生产资金
   各地人民银行举办粮棉优待储蓄
    【本报讯】今年秋粮和棉花的统购工作即将在各地普遍展开。为了帮助广大农民妥善安排出售粮食、棉花后的余款，有计划地积聚资金投入生产，各地人民银行正着手举办“粮棉优待储蓄”。
    去冬今春，人民银行举办的“优待售粮储蓄”受到广大农民的欢迎，三个月的时间，收储总数达到四万二千多亿元。今年春耕生产期间，各地人民银行普遍加强了兑付工作，及时把储蓄款及优厚的利息送到农民手中，有力地支持了农民的生产。当时许多农民表示在今年出售粮食、棉花以后，一定要把余款存入国家银行。今年的“粮棉优待储蓄”仍然规定有优厚的利息：存款一个月到三个月，月息一分二厘；四个月到六个月，月息一分五厘。为了便利农民存款和取款，收储和兑付的手续今年将有不少改进。如“粮棉优待储蓄”的存单普遍采用“定期定额”的办法，事先印好各种分期、分款额的存单，存款时便不要临时填写。今年各地人民银行除尽量增设收储站外，还要广泛委托信用合作社和粮食收购站等办理收储及兑付业务。
    目前，各地人民银行一般都积极进行了“粮棉优待储蓄”的准备工作。中国人民银行江西、四川、山东、陕西等十多个省、市分行已经制定了举办“粮棉优待储蓄”的具体办法。甘肃省许多地区的人民银行进行了储蓄预约工作，不少农民预定要将百分之五十以上的售粮款存入银行。辽宁省金县等地不少人民银行都已训练了开展“粮棉优待储蓄”工作的干部。
