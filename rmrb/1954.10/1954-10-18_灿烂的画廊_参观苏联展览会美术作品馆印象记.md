    A Splendid Gallery
    — Impressions of Visiting the Art Works Hall of the Soviet Exhibition
    Xu Xingzhi

    We entered the Art Works Hall and felt as though we were in a rich and splendid palace of art. On display were creations by Soviet People's Artists, Honored Artists, and masters who had won the Stalin Prize many times, as well as works by young and talented painters. Because they possess a high degree of ideological and artistic level, profound content and beautiful forms of expression, diverse styles and sublime aesthetics, each work deeply attracts the audience and leaves an unforgettable impression in people's minds.

    In those oil paintings, the various aspects of the lives of the Soviet people are truly reflected. Whether in historical paintings, genre paintings, landscapes, or portraits, the happiness and freedom of the Soviet people are expressed everywhere, as well as the beauty of nature being constantly transformed, and the features of the Soviet motherland marching towards communism.

    Soviet historical paintings not only depict the long and distant past, but also modern historical events. The enormous painting "All Power to the Soviets, Peace to the People!" created by D. A. Nalbandyan and his team is a monumental modern historical painting: It depicts the moment on November 8, 1917, at the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets held in the Smolny Palace, when Lenin announced that all power had been transferred to the Soviets and passed the Decree on Peace. The painters here arranged the composition with the great Lenin in the center, with his close comrades Stalin, Sverdlov, Dzerzhinsky, etc. standing behind him. Under the red felt-covered podium, representatives from all over the country tightly surround him, listening to the leader's speech with full confidence. Outside the window is a dark blue night sky, and the room is filled with warm light. From the picture, we seem to hear Lenin's steel-like, loud voice echoing among the light-reflecting marble beams and pillars. At that very moment, a new era in human history was opened up, and the world's first new country with the proletariat in power appeared.

    However, the declining classes were not willing to die, and reactionary forces at home and abroad colluded with each other to carry out armed intervention against the Soviet regime and launched a civil war. The Party then declared the whole country a military camp, calling on the Red Army of workers and peasants to resist enemies both inside and outside the country. Two masterpieces by the great military painter M. B. Grekov, "Machine Gun Carriage" and "In the Cossack Village," are historical depictions of the Soviet domestic revolutionary war. As Voroshilov said: "Grekov's oil paintings will forever be precious and vivid records of the arduous and great era of class war."

    After three Five-Year Plans, just as the Soviet regime was gradually consolidated and the people began to live prosperous lives, the Hitler bandit gang frantically attacked the Soviet Union, and the entire Soviet people, under the wise leadership of Stalin, carried out the heroic and great Patriotic War. "Tanya" created by Kukryniksy fully reflects the history of the Soviet people's unyielding anti-fascist struggle. After five years of hard work, the three painters finally created such a moving masterpiece. The painters arranged two opposing camps in the picture: on one side, the residents of the Soviet countryside with anger in their eyes and hatred for the enemy, and on the other side, the inhumane Hitler bandit army that regarded human life as grass. From the characteristics of each person's appearance and expression, an unusually clear contrast can be seen. The painters made a prominent description of Tanya. Tanya's face is not covered with dark colors, but is bright and cheerful. Her heroic posture standing under the gallows shows a resolute and unyielding heroic image, expressing her inner confidence in the victory of the motherland and her noble qualities. From the painting, the painters encourage the Soviet people to defeat the inhumane fascist bandits and arouse the heroic enthusiasm to defend the Soviet motherland.

    Among the historical paintings reflecting the Great Patriotic War, there are also F. S. Bogorodsky's "Glory to the Fallen Heroes" with the theme of heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country, V. G. Puzirkov's "Black Sea Sailors" with the theme of heroic naval landings, P. A. Krivonogov's "Defenders of the Brest Fortress" with the theme of defending fortresses, and the same painter's "Victory" with the theme of capturing Berlin, etc., all of which are outstanding works.

    D. A. Nalbandyan's "Great Friendship" depicts the meeting between the great leaders of China and the Soviet Union in 1950. In the quiet lamplight, Stalin and Chairman Mao are having a heart-to-heart talk. It was precisely because of such a historical meeting that a brotherly alliance was formed between China and the Soviet Union, consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

    Soviet genre paintings often make us feel close, and their characteristics lie not in depicting the external world, but in elucidating the essence of people and life, and expressing rich thoughts and feelings.

    S. A. Grigoriev's "Admitting a Komsomol Member" vividly depicts the Komsomol members kindly but also strictly admitting a young woman to the organization. The painter depicts the young woman applying to join the organization as the center, with the young committee members in front, asking the applicant's wishes with a kind and serious expression. Behind her, on the sofa, sit two figures, such as the party branch secretary or the Communist Youth League branch secretary. Although the girl is a little embarrassed, her reason and the training of daily life are enough to calm her throbbing heart, so from the outside, she is still calm. This painting truly shows the most exciting and solemn moment in the lives of Soviet youth. The painter profoundly portrays the amiable image of young people in the Stalin era.

    A. I. Laktionov's "Letter from the Front," which once aroused fierce debate in the Soviet art world but was welcomed by the broad masses of people, is a genre painting reflecting the Patriotic War from the daily life of the people in the rear far away from the front line. The painter cleverly processes a group of relatives reading a letter from the front in the sunlight on the balcony of an ordinary resident. The mother leans against the door frame, happily listening to the young pioneer sitting on the stool reading the letter. Next to him, a young girl - an air defense duty officer - is listening with great interest, with one hand resting on the railing. The injured soldier who delivered the letter is listening to the language of his familiar partner with close concern. The painter expresses the optimism and patriotism of the Soviet people in extremely simple and clear artistic language. From the picture, it is felt that personal life and social life are inseparable, and the individual and the motherland are integrated into a whole. The painter intimately portrays the typical people in the rear during the Patriotic War, and even more embodies the close connection between the Soviet front and the rear in the war.

    F. P. Reshetnikov's "Another Two" is a work welcomed by the broad masses of the Soviet people and familiar to the Chinese people. The painter depicts a playful, lazy student who brought a bad report card home, and everyone blamed him for his bad grades. The mother's face showed a worried and complaining mood, the sister stared at him with a stern face, the younger brother smiled innocently, and only a dog rushed at him to show affection. The little protagonist of "Another Two" lowered his head, with an embarrassed expression on his face. His beloved skates were exposed from his schoolbag, which was clearly the evidence of his bad grades. From this painting, the painter shows a keen observation of life and is a master at portraying psychological characteristics. This is the best textbook on Soviet family life and children's education.

    The same painter's "Striving for Peace" depicts a group of French children risking danger to write peace slogans on the walls of a street corner. In the distant alley, police can be vaguely seen using force to disperse a group of demonstrators. From the broken ruins of the building, we can see that the wounds of the imperialist war have not yet recovered, and the people live in the abyss of extreme poverty and suffering. Therefore, when the warmongers try to launch a third world war, the only central task of the working people is to strive for "peace!" The painter excellently depicts the courage, determination, and wit of the young heroes. From the different personalities, movements, and characteristics of each child, people can appreciate the exploitation of the people by the ruling class in capitalist countries, as well as the heroic behavior of patriots fighting for peace.

    Another lovely children's genre painting is S. A. Grigoriev's "Goalkeeper." This painting depicts a group of children who have just returned from school and are engaged in a small ball game on a narrow roadside. The painting does not show the full view of both sides of the game, but highlights one side's "goalkeeper," who is bending over and watching the direction of the serve with sharp attention; all the children's eyes are nervously watching the other side outside the painting, expressing the children's vigilant and responsible spirit of guarding. The painter not only fully grasps the children's psychology, but also grasps the psychology of the viewers, causing the viewers to emit excited and tense resonance, and evokes people to pursue the association of actions outside the painting.

    In Soviet landscape paintings, not only is the beauty of nature expressed, but also people can perceive the changes in the natural world that have occurred in Stalin's "Plan to Transform Nature." Painters also express the features of the motherland marching towards communism in landscape paintings. For example, female painter L. I. Brodskaia's "Evening in the Suburbs of Moscow," U. Stonkbaev's "Evening on Lake Issyk-Kul," A. M. Gritsai's "On the Volga River," V. F. Chagonnek's "Spring Day," N. M. Romadin's "Autumn," V. N. Bakshaev's "Birch Forest," M. V. Kupriyanov's "After the Rain," etc., all paint the richness, magnificence, and prosperity of the Soviet land.

    In Soviet portrait paintings, painters are not satisfied with creating the images of ordinary people, but must express the active builders of communism and the representatives of the new type of people cultivated by Soviet reality.

    The Soviet people like painters to create the images of their beloved leaders, because they can embody the noble qualities of the best representatives from the images of the great leaders—Lenin and Stalin—as examples to learn from. F. S. Shurpin's "The Morning of Our Motherland" is a Stalin portrait created under such a requirement. The painter uses the morning as the background, the sun has just risen, shining on the vast and boundless land, shining on large and small factories and collective farms. In the fields lined with high-voltage power poles, tractors move one after another. In such a lovely morning of the motherland, Stalin, who casually comes to the fields for a walk, stands calmly and steadily, looking into the distance. The painter uses an extremely ordinary composition to express the great image of an extremely extraordinary person—the creator of a happy communist life.

    S. B. Viktorov's "Mayakovsky in the Studio" allows us to see how the poet and painter Mayakovsky, in the difficult years of the early revolution when there was a lack of fuel and bread, worked tirelessly with his companions in the simple "ROSTA Window" studio, using his powerful verses and sharp satirical paintings to ruthlessly attack the domestic and foreign enemies who were attacking the Soviets. The painter not only grasped the poet's appearance and demeanor, but also fully portrayed the poet's character.

    Among the portraits on display is also the "Group Portrait of Painters" painted by A. M. Gerasimov, the head of the Soviet art delegation currently visiting our country and the president of the Soviet Academy of Arts. The four old painters painted in this picture are art masters who were respected by the people even before the revolution. Gerasimov himself is also an old painter with high moral standing, but he still has the respect of a young man for these four old painters when he engages in creation. He used very mature techniques to express the sincere friendship of the four old painters. They are discussing probably art-related issues in a sunny guest room, sincerely exchanging opinions. The brushstrokes on the picture are natural and mellow, and the colors are faithful to the object, without the slightest trace of exaggeration. The details are simple and concise, which shows that the painter's skills have reached the point of perfection.

    Seeing these elaborate masterpieces of Soviet painters, one cannot help but think of the care and help given by the Soviet Party, the government, and the great leaders, the supervision and encouragement given by the entire Soviet people, and even more so the hard creative work, profound cultivation, and long-term struggle of the artists. Their content is solid and rich, and their forms of expression, under the guiding principles of socialist realism, have also given play to the different talents and personalities of each person, creating diverse expressions and creative styles. They came to our country for exhibition, giving our people great education and encouragement, and are even more worthy of learning from for our country's artists.

    灿烂的画廊
    ——参观苏联展览会美术作品馆印象记
    许幸之
    我们走进美术作品馆，仿佛身处在丰富灿烂的艺术宫殿中。陈列在那里的有苏联人民艺术家、功勋艺术家、并多次荣膺斯大林奖金的大师们的创作，也有年轻的天才画家们的作品。由于它们具备着高度的思想性和艺术水平、深刻的内容和优美的表现形式、多种多样的风格和崇高的美感，每一件作品都深深地吸引着观众，在人们的脑海里烙印下难忘的印象。
    在那些油画作品里，真实地反映了苏联人民各方面的生活情景。无论从历史画、风俗画、风景画以及肖像画中，处处都表现了苏联人民生活的幸福和自由，并表现了在不断被改造中的大自然的美，和走向共产主义的苏维埃祖国的风貌。
    苏联的历史画，不仅表现悠久的过去的历史，而且也表现现代的历史事件。德·阿·纳尔班殿及其工作组创作的那幅巨大的“政权归于苏维埃、和平归于各族人民！”便是具有纪念碑性的现代历史画：这是一九一七年十一月八日在斯莫尔尼宫举行第二次全俄苏维埃代表大会，列宁宣布，全部政权已归苏维埃掌握，并通过和平法令的一刹那的情景。画家们在这里安排了以伟大列宁为中心的构图位置，背后站立着他的亲密的战友斯大林、斯维尔德洛夫、捷尔任斯基等。在红毡铺着的讲台下面紧紧地围绕着从各地来的代表们，他们满怀信心地倾听着领袖的演讲。窗外呈现着蔚蓝的夜空，室内充满了温暖的光亮。从画面上我们仿佛听到列宁的如钢铁般的宏亮的声音，在反映着灯光的大理石的梁柱间回绕着反响。就在这一刹那，开辟了人类历史的新纪元，出现了世界上第一个无产阶级掌握政权的新国家。
    然而，没落阶级是不甘心死亡的，国内外反动派互相勾结起来，对苏维埃政权进行武装干涉并掀起国内战争。党于是宣布全国为军营，号召工农红军对内外敌人进行抗战。伟大的军事画家米·波·格列科夫的两幅杰作：“机关枪二轮车”和“在哥萨克人的田庄里”，便是苏联国内革命战争中的历史写照。正如伏罗希洛夫所说：“格列科夫的油画永远成为艰苦伟大阶级战争时代的珍贵而生动的纪录”。
    经过了三个五年计划，正当苏维埃政权逐渐巩固而人民开始过着富裕生活的时候，希特勒匪帮却疯狂地进攻苏联，于是全苏联人民在斯大林的英明领导下进行了英勇伟大的卫国战争。库克雷尼克塞所创作的“丹娘”，就是充分反映了苏联人民不屈不挠地反法西斯斗争的历史画之一。三位画家经过了五年的艰苦劳动，终于创造了这样一幅感人肺腑的杰作。画家们在画面上布置了两个敌对形势的阵营：一边是眼光里含着怒火，并仇视着敌人的苏维埃乡村的居民，另一边则是灭绝人性、视人命如草芥的希特勒匪军。从每个人的外形和表情的特征上，看出了异常鲜明的对比。画家们对于丹娘作了突出的描写。丹娘的脸上没有敷上灰暗的色彩，反而是明朗和愉快。她伫立在死刑架下的英姿，显现出坚决顽强、至死不屈的英雄形象，表现了她内心对祖国胜利的信心，表现了她那种崇高的品质。画家们从画幅上鼓舞着苏联人民，必须战胜惨无人道的法西斯匪帮，而唤起保卫苏维埃祖国的英雄主义的热情。
    反映伟大卫国战争的历史画中，还有以为国牺牲的英雄为题材的费·谢·波戈罗德斯基的“光荣属于阵亡的英雄们”，以英勇的海军登陆为题材的维·格·普兹尔科夫的“黑海水兵”，以保卫要塞为题材的彼·亚·克里沃诺果夫的“布列斯特要塞的保卫者”，以及同一画家以攻克柏林为题材的
  “胜利”等等，都是杰出的作品。
    德·阿·纳尔班殿的“伟大的友谊”，描写了一九五○年中苏两国伟大领袖的会见。画着安静的灯光下，斯大林和毛主席在那儿促膝谈心。正是由于这样一个历史性的会见，结成了中苏两国之间兄弟般地友好同盟，巩固了亚洲和世界的和平。
    苏联的风俗画，往往使我们感到亲切，它们的特点不在于描写外在的境界，而在于阐明人物与生活的本质，表现丰富的思想和感情。
    谢·阿·格里哥里也夫的“接收共青团员”，这幅画生动地描写了共青团员们善意地同时也是严格地接收一个女青年的入团式。画家描写了以申请入团的少女为中心，前面是年青的委员们，带着和颜悦色而又是严肃的表情，在询问入团者的志愿。在她背后的沙发上坐着党支部书记或者是团支部书记这样两个人物。少女虽然有些窘，但她的理智和日常生活的锻炼，足以镇定她跳动着的心房，所以从外表看来她还是镇定的。这幅画真实地显示了苏联青年在生活中最激动和最庄严的一刹那。画家深刻地刻划了斯大林时代年青人们可亲的形象。
    曾经引起苏联美术界激烈争论，但为广大人民所欢迎的亚·伊·拉克提昂诺夫的“前线来信”，是从远离前线的后方人民日常生活中，反映卫国战争的风俗画。画家聪明地从一个普通居民的阳台上，在阳光照耀下，处理一群亲人们在朗读从前方来信的情景。母亲依着门框，愉快地倾听着坐在凳子上的少先队员念信。在他旁边的一个少女——防空值日员，一手支在栏杆上很有兴趣地听着。而递信来的受伤的战士，带着亲密的关怀听他所熟悉的伙伴的语言。画家用极其平易、清晰的艺术语言，表达了苏联人民乐观主义精神和爱国主义的热忱。从画面上令人感到个人生活和社会生活的不可分，把个人和祖国融成了一个整体。画家亲切地刻划了卫国战争时代后方人民的典型，更体现了在战争中苏维埃前线和后方的紧密的联系。
    费·巴·列舍特尼科夫的“又是一个两分”，是受到苏联广大人民所欢迎并且为中国人民所熟悉的作品。画家描写了一个贪玩、不用功读书的小学生，带了不好的记分册回到家里，所有的人都对他的坏成绩表示了责备。妈妈脸上露出发愁而埋怨的心情，姐姐绷着脸注视着他，小弟弟带着天真的讥笑，只有一条狗扑在他身上表示亲热。“又是一个两分”的小主人公低着头，脸上现出尴尬的表情，自己所心爱的溜冰鞋从书包里露出来，这显然是他造成坏成绩的物证。从这幅画里显出画家对生活富有敏锐的观察力，并且是刻划心理特征的能手。这是有关苏联家庭生活和儿童教育的最好的教科书。
    同一画家所画的“争取和平”，描写一群法国孩子们不顾危险地在街角的墙壁上写和平标语，远处的深巷里隐约可以看见警察们正在用武力驱散一批示威的人群。从破碎了的大厦的残壁中，我们看到帝国主义大战的创伤还没有恢复，人民生活在极端贫穷和苦难的深渊里。因此，当战争贩子们企图掀起第三次大战的时候，劳动人民唯一的中心任务就是争取“和平！”画家卓越地描写了年青的英雄们的勇敢、决心和机智，从每个孩子的不同的个性、动作和特征上，人们可以体会到资本主义国家统治阶级对人民的压榨，以及爱国者为和平而斗争的英勇行为。
    另一张可爱的儿童风俗画是谢·阿·格里哥里也夫的“球门手”，这幅画描写了刚刚放学归来的一群儿童，在一个狭窄的路边展开了一场小小的球赛。画上并没有画出球赛的双方全景，而突出地表现了一方的“球门手”，他弯着腰，用尖锐的注意力注视着发球的方向；所有孩子们的目光，都紧张地看着画外的另一方，表达了孩子们警惕地守卫的负责精神。画家不仅充分掌握了孩子们的心理，而且也掌握了观赏者的心理，使观者发出兴奋而紧张的共鸣，并唤起人们追究画外动作的联想。
    在苏联的风景画中，不仅表现大自然的美，而且可以令人觉察到斯大林“改造自然计划”所发生的自然界的变化。画家在风景画里同样表现了向共产主义迈进的祖国的风貌。例如女画家丽·依·布罗茨卡娅的“莫斯科近郊的傍晚”，乌·司汤克巴也夫的“依絮克库里湖的傍晚”，阿·米·格里才依的“窝尔加河上”，维·费·查果涅克的“春日”，尼·米·罗玛金的“秋天”，华·尼·巴克舍也夫的“白桦林”，米·华·库普里扬诺夫的“雨后”等等，都画出了苏维埃国土的富饶、壮丽和欣欣向荣的景象。
    苏联的肖像画，画家们不以创造普通人的形象为满足，而必须表现共产主义的积极的建设者，苏维埃现实所培养出来的新型人物的代表。
    苏联人民喜欢画家们创造他们所敬爱的领袖们的形象，因为他们可以从伟大领袖——列宁、斯大林的形象中，体现最优秀的代表人物崇高的品质，作为学习的榜样。费·萨·叔尔宾的“我们祖国的早晨”就是在这样一种要求下创作出来的斯大林像。画家以早晨为背景，太阳刚刚升起，照耀着广阔无边的大地，照耀着大小工厂和集体农庄。在排列着高压电线杆的田野里，拖拉机一个跟着一个地移动着。就在这样一个可爱的祖国的早晨，随便到田野间来散步的斯大林，平静而稳定地站着，眺望着远方。画家用极其平凡的构图，表现了极不平凡的人物——共产主义幸福生活的缔造者的伟大形象。
    谢·巴·维克托罗夫的“马耶可夫斯基在画室内”使我们看到诗人兼画家的马耶可夫斯基，在革命初期，缺乏燃料和面包的艰苦的年代里，如何在那设备简陋的“罗斯塔之窗”的画室里，跟他的伙伴们不知疲倦地工作着，用他有力的诗句和锋利的讽刺画，无情地打击着向苏维埃进攻的内外敌人。画家不仅掌握了诗人的外表和风度，并充分刻划了诗人的性格。
    在展出的肖像画里，还有正在我国访问的苏联文化代表团团员、苏联艺术研究院院长亚·米·格拉西莫夫所画的“画家群像”。这幅画所画的四位老画家是从革命以前就已经为人民所尊敬的艺术大师。格拉西莫夫本人也是年高德重的老画家了，但他对于这四位老画家仍旧怀着年青人的尊敬的心情来从事创作的。他用非常成熟的技巧，表达四个老画家的真诚的友爱。他们在充满阳光的客室里商谈着大概有关美术上的问题，诚恳地交换着意见。画面的笔触自然浑厚，色彩忠诚于对象，没有丝毫浮夸的痕迹。细节描写朴素而简练，这说明画家的技巧已经到达炉火纯青的境地。
    看到苏联画家们的这些精心杰作，不能不想起苏联党、政府和伟大领袖们所给予的关怀和帮助，全苏联人民所给予的监督和鼓舞，更不能不是由于艺术家们经过艰苦的创造性的劳动，深刻的修养和长期奋斗的收获。它们的内容是坚实而丰富的，它们的表现形式，在社会主义现实主义的指导原则下，也发挥了各人不同的天才和个性，创造了多种多样的表现方法和创作风格。它们来到我国展览，给予我国人民以莫大的教育和鼓舞，对我国的艺术家说来更是值得学习的榜样。
