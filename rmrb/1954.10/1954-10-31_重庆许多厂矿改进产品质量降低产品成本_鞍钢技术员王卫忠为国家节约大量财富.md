Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing—Many factories and mines in Chongqing have improved product quality and reduced costs in carrying out labor competitions. After the workers of the joint state-private Donglin Coal Mine Washing Plant launched a labor competition of the same type of work, they improved the coal washing machine equipment and operating technology, and promoted advanced experience such as closed-fire coking. The qualified rate of metallurgical coke products in September has been increased to 100%. The qualified rate of metallurgical coke of the state-owned Nantong Coal Mine Washing Plant has also reached 100% since October. The quality of seven major products of the 101 Steel Plant in September improved compared with August, among which the qualified rate of small and medium-sized steel and rails increased by 11% to 20%. The quality of 20-count cotton yarn from the joint state-private No. 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory, Yuxin Textile Factory, and private Shashi Yarn Factory generally improved by one grade in September compared with August.

Many factory and mine workers saved and reasonably used raw materials, which played a significant role in reducing production costs and fulfilling profit delivery. Since September, the firing workshop of the state-owned Sichuan Cement Plant has saved more than 370 tons of coal in two working sections, and the cost of raw material transportation has been reduced by more than 820 million yuan. This factory has already completed the annual profit delivery plan for the whole factory ahead of schedule on October 15. Recently, it has put forward an ambitious goal of increasing the profit delivery to the state by another 6.1 billion yuan in the fourth quarter. Since the third quarter, the workers of the 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory have made saving cotton an important part of the labor competition, so that the amount of cotton used per yarn has been reduced below the national standard, saving more than 17,000 kilograms of raw cotton throughout the season. In September, the coal consumption of the 501 Power Plant and the newly built Chongqing Power Plant decreased by 5% to 9.7% compared with the plan, and the production cost also decreased accordingly.

Since August and September, many factories and mines in Chongqing have criticized the tendency to neglect cost reduction and quality improvement in the labor competition before August, and further mobilized workers to implement operation plans and launch a labor competition with technological innovation as the main content. Therefore, product quality has rapidly improved, and costs have been reduced.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th—Wang Weizhong, a young technician from the Anshan Iron and Steel Metal Structure Installation Engineering Company, went deep into the construction site and closely integrated with workers in the reconstruction project of the first and second ore screening plants of the Dagushan Concentrator of Anshan Iron and Steel. He carefully checked the design drawings and corrected many errors in the design drawings that did not match the actual situation, saving the state a wealth of more than 200 million yuan.

The reconstruction of the first and second ore screening plants of the Dagushan Concentrator of Anshan Iron and Steel is an important project, which requires a large number of steel structures. After Wang Weizhong, a young technician, and other workers accepted the construction task of metal structure installation for this construction site, he carefully reviewed more than 60 design drawings again, and found that there were many errors in the design drawings that did not match the actual situation. In addition, he closely integrated with the workers, and after careful research, found many unreasonable phenomena in construction and material application. After more than 20 days of hard work, Wang Weizhong put forward many rationalization proposals based on the omissions and shortcomings in the design work, which were welcomed and supported by the design department and the workers. After these shortcomings were corrected, a total of 42.554 tons of steel were saved for the country, saving more than 500 man-days, with a total savings of about 200 million yuan.

    重庆许多厂矿改进产品质量降低产品成本
    鞍钢技术员王卫忠为国家节约大量财富
    【新华社重庆讯】　重庆市许多厂矿在开展劳动竞赛中改进了产品质量，降低了成本。公私合营东林煤矿洗炼厂职工开展同工种劳动竞赛后，改进了洗煤机设备和操作技术，推广了闭火炼焦等先进经验，九月份冶金焦产品合格率已提高到百分之百。国营南桐煤矿洗炼厂的冶金焦，十月份以来合格率也达到了百分之百。一零一钢铁厂九月份七种主要产品的质量都比八月份提高了，其中中小型钢材、钢轨等的合格率提高了百分之十一到二十。公私合营六一零纺织染厂、渝新纺织厂、私营沙市纱厂二十支纱的棉纱质量九月份普遍比八月提高了一级。
    许多厂矿职工节约和合理使用原材料，对降低生产成本，完成上缴利润起了很大作用。九月以来，国营四川水泥厂烧成车间两个工段节省了三百七十多吨煤，原料运输成本降低了八亿二千多万元。这个厂在十月十五日已提前完成全厂的全年上缴利润计划，最近又提出了在第四季度再为国家增加上缴利润六十一亿元的努力目标。六一零纺织染厂职工第三季度以来把节约用棉作为劳动竞赛重要内容之一，使每件纱的用棉量降到国家规定标准以下，全季节约了一万七千多公斤原棉。九月份五零一电力厂、新建重庆电力厂煤的消耗量，都比计划降低百分之五到百分之九点七，生产成本也随之下降。
    八、九月份以来，重庆市许多厂矿批判了八月以前在劳动竞赛中忽视降低成本和提高质量的偏向，进一步发动职工贯彻作业计划，展开以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛，因此产品质量迅速提高，成本降低了。
    【新华社三十日讯】　鞍钢金属结构安装工程公司青年技术员王卫忠，在鞍山钢铁公司大孤山选矿厂第一、二筛矿分厂的改建工程中，深入工地和工人密切结合，仔细检查设计图纸，改正了许多设计图纸和实际情况不符的错误，为国家节约价值两亿多元财富。
    鞍山钢铁公司大孤山选矿厂第一、二筛矿分厂的改建是一项重要的工程，它需要大量的钢材结构。青年技术员王卫忠，在和其他职工接受了这个工地金属结构安装的施工任务以后，仔细地重新审查了六十多张设计图纸，结果发现设计图纸和实际情况有许多不符的错误。另外他还和工人密切结合，经过仔细研究，发现了许多在施工上和运用材料上不合理的现象。经过二十多天的艰苦劳动，王卫忠根据设计工作中的遗漏和缺点，提出了许多合理化建议，受到设计部门和工人们的欢迎和支持。这些缺点被改正以后，共给国家节省钢材四十二吨五百五十四公斤，节省五百多个人工，总计节约价值约二亿多元。
