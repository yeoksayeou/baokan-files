In the past, the working people in the coastal areas of southern China, due to long-term oppression and exploitation by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, were unable to make a living. Many had no choice but to leave their homes and seek a living abroad, leaving their families behind in China. There are 12 million overseas Chinese, and about 11 million dependents in China. Among the domestic dependents of overseas Chinese, there are more than 6.4 million in Guangdong Province (accounting for one-fifth of the province's population), more than 2 million in Fujian Province (accounting for one-sixth of the province's population), and the rest are distributed in Guangxi, Yunnan, Shandong, Zhejiang, and other places.

The vast majority of dependents of overseas Chinese are farmers. As a result of the long-term exploitation by the landlord class, they generally lacked land. Some overseas Chinese who were forced to go abroad sent back remittances, earned through their hard work, to support their parents, wives, and children. However, during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to inflation and high prices, the lives of the dependents of overseas Chinese were completely insecure. Therefore, before liberation, there were frequent incidents of starvation among the dependents of overseas Chinese in Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces.

After liberation, in the land reform movement, the dependents of overseas Chinese, along with all farmers, obtained land, houses, and farming tools, and turned over politically and economically.

According to a survey of 261 townships in four counties of Guangdong Province, Taishan, Zhongshan, Chaoyang, and Chenghai, before the land reform, the average land ownership per capita for dependents of overseas Chinese farmers (including poor, hired, and middle peasants) was only 0.44 mu. After the land reform, it increased to 1.07 mu. In Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, 231 overseas Chinese townships saw land ownership among dependents of overseas Chinese poor and hired peasants increase twofold after the land reform.

After the domestic dependents of overseas Chinese were allocated land and other means of production, they owned what they earned, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. Many model figures emerged. For example, Zhang Hao, the deputy township head of Kunlun Township in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, whose husband had been in Indonesia for more than 20 years, was allocated 2.9 mu of land during the land reform. Because she actively learned from the farming experiences of others and improved her techniques, in 1953, she harvested more than four dan of grain per mu, an increase of 50 percent compared to 1952. Under her leadership, farmers throughout the township attached great importance to advanced methods such as seed selection. Last year, the township increased production by more than 12,000 baskets of grain, and more than 60 high-yield households emerged. At the same time, people's governments at all levels in the overseas Chinese areas attached great importance to leading and organizing dependents of overseas Chinese to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After vigorously publicizing the general task of the state during the transition period, the broad masses of dependents of overseas Chinese raised their socialist consciousness, and more and more people participated in mutual aid and cooperative production. According to statistics from twelve townships in five counties of Taishan, Kaiping, Zhongshan, Chao'an, and Chaoyang in Guangdong Province at the end of 1953, the number of dependents of overseas Chinese participating in mutual aid and cooperation accounted for 32 percent of the total number of households of dependents of overseas Chinese. In mountainous, semi-mountainous areas, and overseas Chinese townships in Hainan, because the vast majority of dependents of overseas Chinese have always been engaged in agricultural production, the organized rate has generally reached 50 to 60 percent. In 33 overseas Chinese townships in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, there are 154 permanent mutual aid teams and 456 temporary mutual aid teams, with the number of organized households accounting for 57 percent of the total number of households.

Some dependents of overseas Chinese (mainly families of overseas Chinese workers and small land leasers) originally did not participate in labor production. After education on the general line and "labor is glorious," many people have begun to participate in agricultural production and actively work; some have joined mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives. For example, in twelve key townships in Taishan, Zhongshan, and other places in Guangdong Province, there are 778 households of dependents of overseas Chinese who are families of overseas Chinese workers and small land leasers, of which 641 households have engaged in labor production, and 116 households have joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In Sanwu Township, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, many dependents of overseas Chinese originally did not engage in labor production, but now 70 percent have participated in production.

With the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives have also developed considerably. In some areas, more than 50 percent of the dependents of overseas Chinese (counted by household) have joined credit cooperatives, and 80 percent have joined supply and marketing cooperatives.

Handicraft production in the overseas Chinese areas has also gradually embarked on the road of mutual aid and cooperation. By the end of 1953, Guangdong Province had organized five handicraft cooperatives for dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese, four handicraft factories with cooperative characteristics, and six production groups and sideline production mutual aid teams, with 735 participants. In Fujian Province, there are approximately 40 organized handicraft workshops and factories throughout the province, with more than 1,000 dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese participating.

Due to the state's support and assistance for agricultural production and the development of mutual aid and cooperation, the dependents of overseas Chinese, like farmers across the country, have achieved bumper harvests year after year, and their incomes have increased year by year. For example, the Liang Xiuzhen mutual aid team of dependents of overseas Chinese in Meixian County, Guangdong Province, had an average yield of 1,061 jin per mu in 1953, an increase of 67 percent compared to 1952. Her mutual aid team was rated as a first-class agricultural production increase mutual aid team in the Yue-East district of Guangdong Province. In March of this year, this mutual aid team merged with two other mutual aid teams in the township to form the Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative, with Liang Xiuzhen as the chairman. The Qiu Shuileng mutual aid team of dependents of overseas Chinese in Xinyan Township, Haicheng County, Fujian Province, has won the model title four times. Team member Lin Shiqing harvested 1,500 jin of grain from his 3.5 mu of land this year, an increase of 50 percent compared to last year. Team member Chen Shuihua (a dependent of overseas Chinese) harvested a total of 1,160 jin of grain in the early season from her 2.93 mu of paddy fields; she also harvested a total of 210 jin of peanuts and soybeans from her 3.96 mu of dry land. In addition to public grain and the family's rations, there is still a surplus of about 200 jin of grain. The family also raises six large and small pigs, 33 chickens, and 15 ducks.

After the land reform, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and other movements, the political awareness of the dependents of overseas Chinese has greatly increased. Among the 15 members of the Farmers' Association in Zhonglan Township, Dama District, Dapu County, Guangdong Province, seven are dependents of overseas Chinese. In the grassroots election movement in the overseas Chinese areas, the dependents of overseas Chinese actively participated in the democratic elections. In the townships where dependents of overseas Chinese are concentrated, such as Jishan, Shangdun, Xinqiao, and Tonglin in Yong'an County, Fujian Province, more than 95 percent of the voters participated in the election. In the national grassroots elections, many dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese were honorably elected as people's representatives. For example, in three townships in Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, 20 returned overseas Chinese and dependents of overseas Chinese were elected as people's representatives. Liang Xiuzhen, a dependent of overseas Chinese in Meixian County, Guangdong Province, was elected as a representative to the Provincial People's Congress.

In the era when the people are the masters of their own affairs, with the development of production, the purchasing power of the people in the overseas Chinese areas continues to grow. In Jinjiang Town, a famous overseas Chinese township in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, on New Year's Eve this year, the supply and marketing cooperative alone slaughtered 100 pigs, selling nearly 10,000 jin of net meat. 120 dan of granulated sugar were sold, and 20,000 jin of glutinous rice were also supplied, with the average supply quantity increasing by 50 percent compared to the same period last year.

While improving their material lives, the dependents of overseas Chinese who have turned over are eager to improve their culture and actively participate in winter school and folk school studies. In the Jinjiang area of Fujian Province, there were 2,850 folk schools in early 1953, eight times the number before the land reform. Shishi Town, Jinjiang County, in the area, currently has two theaters that can accommodate more than 1,000 people, a cultural station, and a workers' club; there are also five amateur theater troupes and more than ten mass cultural and entertainment organizations, with more than 500 members. Many of them are dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese. For example, in the Dalun Amateur Theater Troupe, dependents of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese account for more than 90 percent.

Currently, the social atmosphere in the overseas Chinese areas has also undergone great changes. Incidents of alcoholism, gambling, and theft rarely occur, social order is unprecedentedly peaceful, and environmental sanitation has also been greatly improved. The contradictions of the past between township boundaries, surname boundaries, and clan boundaries have also gradually disappeared. People live in unity and friendship.

    华侨的家乡
    李望
    过去，祖国南方沿海一带的劳动人民，由于长期遭受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削，无法生活，许多人不得不离乡背井，漂流到国外去谋生，而把眷属留在国内。我国在外侨胞有一千二百万人，留在国内的眷属约一千一百万人。国内华侨眷属，广东省内约六百四十多万人（占全省人口的五分之一），福建省内约二百多万人（占全省人口的六分之一），其他则分布在广西、云南、山东、浙江等地。
    侨眷绝大多数是农民。由于地主阶级长期剥削的结果，他们普遍缺乏土地。有一些被迫出国的侨胞，以自己的辛勤所得寄回国来的侨汇，作为赡养父母及妻儿之用。但是在国民党反动统治时期，由于通货膨胀、物价高涨，侨眷的生活完全没有保障。所以在解放以前，广东、福建等省时常有侨眷饿死的事件发生。
    解放以后，在土地改革运动中，侨眷和全体农民一道，获得了土地、房屋和耕具，在政治上和经济上都翻了身。
    根据广东省台山、中山、潮阳、澄海四个县二百六十一个乡的调查，土地改革以前，侨眷农民（包括贫、雇、中农）平均每人占有土地仅四分四厘。经过土地改革，增加到一亩零七厘。广东省潮阳县二百三十一个侨乡的侨眷贫雇农，经过土地改革，土地增加了两倍。
    国内华侨眷属分到了土地和其他生产资料之后，劳动所得归自己所有，生产积极性大大提高，并涌现出很多模范人物。例如广东省新会县崑崙乡副乡长张好，丈夫去印度尼西亚二十多年，土地改革时，分了二亩九分地。由于她积极学习别人的耕作经验，改进技术，一九五三年，每亩田割了四担多谷，比一九五二年增产百分之五十。在她的带动下，全乡农民都很重视选种等先进方法。去年全乡增产一万二千多箩谷，出现了六十多个丰产户。同时，侨区各级人民政府都十分重视领导和组织侨眷参加互助合作运动。在大张旗鼓宣传国家过渡时期总任务以后，广大侨眷提高了社会主义觉悟，参加互助合作生产的日益增多。据一九五三年底广东省台山、开平、中山、潮安、潮阳五个县十二个乡统计，参加互助合作的侨眷占侨眷总户数的百分之三十二。在山区、半山区和海南侨乡，因侨眷中向来从事农业生产的占绝大多数，所以组织起来的一般已达百分之五十至六十。福建省海澄县三十三个侨乡，有长年互助组一百五十四个，临时互助组四百五十六个，组织起来的户数占总户数的百分之五十七。
    侨眷中有一部分人（主要是侨工家属和小土地出租者）原来不参加劳动生产。经过总路线和“劳动光荣”的教育，有不少人已经开始参加农业生产，积极劳动；有的已参加了互助组或农业生产合作社。如广东省台山、中山等地十二个重点乡，侨工家属和小土地出租者成份的侨眷共七百七十八户，已从事劳动生产的有六百四十一户，其中参加了互助合作组织的有一百一十六户。福建省晋江县三吴乡，侨眷原来多不从事劳动生产，现在参加生产的已达百分之七十。
    随着农业互助合作运动的开展，信用合作社和供销合作社也有了相当的发展。有的地区，华侨眷属参加信用合作社的（以户为单位）已达百分之五十以上，参加供销合作社的达到百分之八十。
    侨区中的手工业生产也逐步走上了互助合作的道路。到一九五三年底，广东省已经组织起来的侨眷、归国华侨手工业合作社有五个，合作社性质的手工业工厂有四个，生产小组、副业生产互助组有六个，参加人数七百三十五名。在福建省，组织起来的手工业工场、作坊，全省约有四十个单位，参加的侨眷、归国华侨有一千多名。
    由于国家对于农业生产的支持和帮助及互助合作的发展，侨眷和全国农民一样，连年获得丰收，收入逐年增加。如广东省梅县侨眷梁秀珍互助组，一九五三年平均每亩产量一千零六十一斤，比一九五二年增加了百分之六十七。她的互助组被评为广东省粤东区甲等农业增产互助组。今年三月，这个互助组和乡里另外两个互助组合并，成立了红旗农业生产合作社，梁秀珍任社长。福建海澄县新垵乡侨眷邱水冷的互助组已四次荣获模范称号。组员林时庆今年三亩半田收了一千五百斤粮食，比去年增产五成。组员陈水花（侨眷）今年二亩九分三水田，早季共收粮食一千一百六十斤；还有三亩九分六旱地，共收花生、黄豆二百一十斤。除了公粮及一家口粮外，尚余粮二百来斤。家里还养着大小毛猪六头、鸡三十三只、鸭十五只。
    经过了土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命等运动，侨眷的政治觉悟大大提高。广东省大埔县大麻区中兰乡十五个农民协会委员中，有七个是侨眷。在侨区基层选举运动中，侨眷都积极参加了民主选举。福建省永安县吉山、上墩、新侨、桐林等侨眷集中的乡，参加选举的选民，都达百分之九十五以上。在全国基层选举中，有不少侨眷和归国华侨光荣地当选为人民代表。如云南省腾冲县三个乡中，有归国华侨、侨眷二十人当选为人民代表。广东省梅县侨眷梁秀珍，更当选为省人民代表大会代表。
    在人民当家作主的年代里，随着生产的发展，侨区人民的购买力不断地增长。在福建著名侨乡晋江县金井镇，今年夏历除夕那天，光供销社就杀了一百头毛猪，卖出净肉近一万斤，砂糖销售一百二十担，糯米也供应了二万斤，比去年同期的供应数量平均增加了百分之五十。
    翻了身的侨眷在物质生活提高的同时，迫切要求提高文化，积极参加冬学和民校学习。福建省晋江专区的民校，在一九五三年初已有二千八百五十所，学员为土地改革前的八倍。该区晋江县石狮镇，目前已有两个可以容纳一千多人的戏院，有一个文化站和一个职工俱乐部；还有五个业余剧团及十多个群众性的文娱组织，拥有五百多人。其中有不少是侨眷和归国华侨。如大崙业余剧团内，侨眷和归国华侨占百分之九十以上。
    目前在侨区，社会风气也有很大改变。酗酒、赌博和偷窃的事件已很少发生，社会秩序空前安宁，环境卫生也大大改善。过去乡界、姓界、房界的矛盾，也逐渐消除了。人们团结友爱地生活着。
