    Hubei Province plans to build 15,000 new agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province this winter and next spring. Before the autumn harvest, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had instructed Party committees at all levels to make all preparations for the establishment of cooperatives, in order to welcome the high tide of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In connection with the work of increasing grain production and disaster relief, the counties have trained a large number of key personnel for establishing cooperatives before and after the autumn harvest. They have also educated mutual aid teams preparing to transfer to cooperatives on various policies. Some areas have officially launched cooperative establishment work. By the end of September, a total of 1,700 agricultural production cooperatives had been established in the province. These newly established cooperatives have begun production and entered a consolidation phase.
    In disaster areas, in order to meet the masses' demands for organizing to overcome difficulties in production, various localities have also developed a number of mutual aid and cooperation organizations that mainly engage in collective sideline production. This type of mutual aid and cooperation organization has indeed played a significant role in production and disaster relief. However, since most of them do not have land as shares and do not meet the conditions of agricultural cooperatives, most of them will be converted into year-round mutual aid teams after the flood recedes, and then gradually converted into agricultural production cooperatives according to the conditions.
    In order to summarize the experience of establishing cooperatives in the autumn and to deploy the specific steps and methods for developing agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a mutual aid and cooperation conference. In addition to analyzing the current situation and affirming the achievements, the conference also criticized the impatient thinking of pursuing quantity and scale in establishing cooperatives.

    Hunan Province will establish 300 forestry production cooperatives in mountainous and hilly areas this winter and next spring.
    Most of Hunan Province is mountainous and hilly. Forestry accounts for a proportion of the province's national economy second only to agriculture and is one of the country's important timber supply bases. However, because private forests account for a very large proportion, scattered individual management has limited the development of production. In order to further develop forestry production and gradually realize the socialist transformation of forestry, as early as the end of August, the Rural Work Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial Forestry Department jointly convened the province's first forestry work conference, deciding to actively strengthen the leadership of forestry work and vigorously carry out the forestry production movement with mutual aid and cooperation as the central link. Subsequently, various special districts also convened forestry work conferences one after another, planning forestry counties, forestry districts, and forestry townships. Various localities have decided to establish 300 forestry production cooperatives (including some agricultural and forestry cooperatives) this winter and next spring.
    At present, various localities are actively carrying out preparatory work for establishing cooperatives. The Provincial Forestry Department started a training class for cadres running forestry cooperatives on October 5th. The Changde Special District decided to transfer a group of cadres from Party, government, and forestry industrial departments, assigning three people to each cooperative. The Qianyang Special District completed the training of seventy cadres for running cooperatives in late September and has now assigned them to townships preparing to establish cooperatives to cultivate cooperative establishment targets. Huitong, Jianghua, and other counties also conducted key pilot projects for forestry cooperatives around August, which greatly helped guide the work of establishing cooperatives after the autumn harvest. In addition, the Rural Work Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party dispatched a working group on October 13th to focus on penetrating forestry areas to assist in the work of establishing cooperatives.

    湖北省将新建一万五千个农业生产合作社
    湖南省将建立三百个林业生产合作社
    湖北省计划今冬明春在全省新建一万五千个农业生产合作社，秋收前，中共湖北省委已指示各级党委做好建社的一切准备工作，以迎接互助合作运动高潮的到来。各县在秋收前后，结合增产粮食与生产救灾等工作，已训练了大批建社骨干；对准备转社的互助组，也进行了各项政策的教育，部分地区并正式展开建社工作。到九月下旬止，全省共已建立了一千七百个农业生产合作社，这些新建社已开始进行生产，进入巩固阶段。
    在灾区，为了满足群众组织起来克服生产上困难的要求，各地还发展了一批以集体经营副业生产为主要内容的互助合作组织，这种互助合作组织在生产救灾中确实发挥了很大作用。但由于它们大部分是土地没有入股，不合乎农业社的条件，水退之后，大部分将转为常年互助组，经过培养提高，然后再分别按条件转成农业生产合作社。
    为了总结秋季建社的经验，部署今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的具体步骤和方法，中共湖北省委最近又召开了互助合作会议，会上除了分析当前情况、肯定已有成绩外，还批判了在建社中贪多贪大的急躁思想。　（本报湖北记者站）
    湖南省山区、丘陵地带，将在今冬明春建立三百个林业生产合作社。
    湖南省大部分都是山区、丘陵区，林业在全省国民经济中所占比重仅次于农业，是全国木材的重要供应基地之一。但由于私有林所占比重极大，分散的个体经营，限制了生产的发展。为了进一步发展林业生产，逐步实现对林业的社会主义改造，早在八月底，中共湖南省委农村工作部和省府林业厅就联合召开了全省第一次林区工作会议，决定积极加强林业工作的领导，大力开展以互助合作为中心环节的林业生产运动。接着，各专区也先后召开了林业工作会议，规划了林业县、林业区、林业乡。各地决定今冬明春建立三百个林业生产合作社（包括一部分农林社）。
    目前各地正在积极进行建社的准备工作。省林业厅在十月五日开办了林业社办社干部训练班。常德专区决定从党、政、林业工业部门抽调一批办社干部，每社配备三人；黔阳专区已在九月下旬完成了七十个办社干部的训练工作，现已分赴准备建社的乡培养建社对象。会同、江华等县并在八月前后进行了林业社的重点试办工作，对指导秋后建社工作有很大帮助。此外，中共湖南省委农村工作部已于十月十三日派出工作组，重点深入林区，协助建社工作。
