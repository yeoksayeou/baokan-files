    The Cooperation Between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union is an Important Factor in Maintaining World Peace
        ——Foreign Public Opinion Comments on the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué
    Soviet Union
    "Izvestia", "Trud", and "Krasnaya Zvezda" published editorials on the 13th commenting on the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué.
    "Izvestia", in its editorial titled "A Major Contribution to the Cause of International Peace and Friendship," stated: "These Sino-Soviet talks are of utmost importance for further consolidating the alliance and friendship between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and China, and for the struggle to consolidate peace in the Far East. This is clearly evident from all the documents mentioned in the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué. The published documents on Sino-Soviet relations demonstrate the further consolidation of the alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, which is in the interests of both countries and the cause of peace in the Far East and the world. These documents are new outstanding contributions to the struggle for friendship and international cooperation among all peoples, and are themselves a victory for the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. They prove once again that the alliance and friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a powerful factor for peace in the Far East and the world."
    "Trud" wrote in its editorial: "The peoples of the Soviet Union and China welcome these documents, which embody sincere friendship and fraternal alliance, with great satisfaction. The friendship between the peoples of these two great countries in the powerful socialist and democratic camp is lasting and unbreakable. Experience has proven that the Sino-Soviet alliance has great vitality, and this alliance is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, as well as the peoples of all countries in the world. It has a tremendous positive impact not only on the economic development of China and the Soviet Union, but also on the entire course of world history. The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the great Asian power, the People's Republic of China, are the foundation for further close cooperation between them, based on the principle of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity."
    "Krasnaya Zvezda" wrote in its editorial: "The Sino-Soviet talks, conducted in an atmosphere of sincere friendship and mutual understanding, show that the two countries have completely identical views on the comprehensive cooperation that is constantly developing between them and on various issues of the international situation. The results of the Sino-Soviet talks are of great significance for the further development of economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. The peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, closely united by unbreakable friendship, are advancing shoulder to shoulder, selflessly helping each other, and their friendship has become a tremendous force for safeguarding and consolidating world peace, unprecedented in human history."
    German Democratic Republic
    Berlin's democratic newspapers have prominently published the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué, as well as the joint declarations and joint communiqués of the Sino-Soviet governments, over the past two days. "Daily Review" published the full texts of the joint declaration and various joint communiqués of the Sino-Soviet governments on the 13th, under the banner headline "Further Consolidation of Sino-Soviet Relations," occupying an entire page.
    An article titled "The Alliance Between the Soviet Union and People's China is Growing Stronger," published in "Neues Deutschland," stated: "The Sino-Soviet talks demonstrate the close, unbreakable friendship between the world's two great countries, and their determination to defend peace. The new and enormous assistance that the Soviet Union is giving to the construction of People's China demonstrates its selfless friendship to 600 million people."
    "Neue Zeit" emphasized that the Sino-Soviet governments have completely identical views on the development of comprehensive cooperation and on various issues of the international situation.
    Romania
    Romania's "Scînteia," "Romînia Liberă," "Munca," and "Scînteia Tineretului" prominently published the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué on the 13th, and published editorials commenting on the great significance of the Sino-Soviet talks.
    The editorial in "Scînteia" pointed out: "The Sino-Soviet talks communiqué is another brilliant manifestation of the great friendship and peaceful will of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. The joint declaration of the Sino-Soviet governments on relations with Japan is a brilliant example of the policy advocated by the two governments of handling relations with Asian countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." When talking about the Soviet Union's transfer of Lushunkou and its facilities jointly used by China and the Soviet Union, the transfer of Soviet shares in Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies to China, and the strengthening of Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation, "Scînteia" emphasized: "Such equal and fraternal mutual assistance relationships aimed at promoting common economic upsurge are the characteristics of the relations between the countries of the socialist and democratic camp." The editorial concluded: "The Romanian people welcome the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué with great pleasure and regard it as a new and important contribution to strengthening the socialist and democratic camp, easing international tensions, and strengthening peace throughout the world."
    The editorial in "Romînia Liberă," when talking about the suggestions on the Korean issue in the joint declaration of the Sino-Soviet governments, stated: "In order to solve one of the most pressing problems in Asia today, the Korean issue, the Sino-Soviet governments have put forward new and important suggestions to give the Korean issue hope of being resolved again from its state of stagnation."
    Hungary
    Hungary's "Szabad Nép" published the full text of the communiqué on the Sino-Soviet talks and the various joint declarations and joint communiqués of the Sino-Soviet governments on the first page on the 12th. Other major newspapers also published excerpts from these documents. All central-level newspapers in Hungary published editorials commenting on the results of the Sino-Soviet talks.
    "Szabad Nép" published an editorial on the 13th stating: "The Soviet Union's assistance to China's economic construction is a continuation of the 300 million US dollar loan in 1950. The significance of this generous and comprehensive assistance to the People's Republic of China, which is entering a period of large-scale socialist industrialization, is self-evident. Every word and sentence in the joint declarations of the Sino-Soviet governments proves the consistency between the two countries. These documents first show that the two countries are completely united in dealing with the aggressive attempts of imperialism. Secondly, the Soviet Union fully supports the legitimate and reasonable demands of People's China for the Chinese territory of Taiwan. Thirdly, these documents also show that the Sino-Soviet governments will do their best to promote the final and reasonable resolution of unresolved issues in Asia. The Five Principles, first put forward by China in resolving Sino-Indian relations, have been affirmed in this Sino-Soviet joint declaration, and these principles are universally valid in relations with all countries. Recently, the United States organized a group in Southeast Asia to encircle and threaten new China. The Sino-Soviet joint declaration and agreement are a response to this attempt." The editorial emphasized: "The international situation is changing, and China's defense capabilities have been strengthened. It would be madness for the imperialists to think that they could interfere in China's internal affairs by force without suffering defeat. The Sino-Soviet alliance has become a force and attraction in Asia and the world that has never been seen before. For the happiness of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and the benefit of world peace, may this alliance prosper!"
    "Magyar Nemzet" wrote on the 12th: "The Sino-Soviet talks communiqué has great international significance. The joint declaration, which shows that the Soviet Union and China have completely identical views on all international issues, as well as the agreement in which the Soviet government provides the government of the People's Republic of China with huge long-term loans and provides new and enormous assistance to the construction of Chinese enterprises, proves that Sino-Soviet friendship is profound and that this friendship will always be a strong pillar of world peace."
    Indonesia
    Jakarta newspapers prominently published the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué and the various joint declarations and joint communiqués of the two governments on the 13th.
    "Harian Rakjat" published this news under the headline: "Friendly Assistance." "Merdeka" had the headline: "China and the Soviet Union Want to Establish Relations with Asian Countries Based on the Five Principles." "Indonesia Raya" published the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué and the various joint declarations and joint communiqués on the front page.
    Japan
    Japanese public opinion warmly commented on the results of the Sino-Soviet talks. The joint declaration of the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China on relations with Japan has become the focus of Japanese public opinion. "Hokkaido Shimbun" pointed out that the joint declaration of the Sino-Soviet governments on relations with Japan has aroused many reactions in Japanese business circles. Most business people expressed great interest in this declaration. This newspaper pointed out that although many business people have adopted a cautious attitude towards this declaration, they hope that this declaration will be used to resolve the issue of diplomatic relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. This newspaper said: "The calls for changing the US policy towards Japan are becoming louder and louder."
    The left-wing Socialist Party welcomed the joint declaration of the Sino-Soviet governments on relations with Japan, and pointed out that this declaration provides a good opportunity for Japan to restore normal relations with "Soviet Russia and Communist China." The left-wing Socialist Party called on the Japanese people to clear the obstacles on the road to restoring normal relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
    France

"L'Humanité" reported the contents of the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué in detail, and emphasized: "The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have completely identical views on all international issues related to guaranteeing the peace and security of the peoples of Asia and Europe." "Libération" particularly highlighted the passage in the news that the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China believe that it is necessary to convene a meeting to discuss the Korean issue in the near future.

    "Le Monde," after pointing out the diplomatic victory won by the democratic camp at the Geneva Conference, wrote: "The attitude towards the 'Southeast Asia Defense Treaty' expressed in the Sino-Soviet joint communiqué will not only be approved by India, but also by most of the Southeast Asian countries that refuse to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The call for 'Asian self-awareness' may arouse the desire of some Japanese political figures to play a certain role in the new relations that have emerged on the Asian continent."
    The Catholic newspaper "La Croix" believes that the Sino-Soviet communiqué is an "event of great significance."
    United Kingdom

    中华人民共和国和苏联的合作是维护世界和平事业的重要因素
        ——各国舆论评中苏两国会谈公报
    苏联
    “消息报”、“劳动报”和“红星报”在十三日发表社论评论苏中会谈公报。
    “消息报”在题为“对国际和平和友好事业的重大贡献”的社论中说：这次苏中会谈对于进一步巩固苏中两国伟大人民之间的同盟和友谊，对于争取巩固远东和平的斗争，都具有极其重要的意义。这从苏中会谈公报中所提到的全部文件中可以明显地看出。已经发表的关于苏中关系的各项文件，证明了苏联和中华人民共和国之间的同盟和友谊得到了进一步的巩固，这是符合于苏中两国的利益，同时也是符合于远东和世界和平事业的利益的。这些文件对于争取各国人民之间的友谊和国际合作的斗争，是新的杰出的贡献，它们本身就是平等、互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整等原则的胜利。它们又一次证明了，苏联和中华人民共和国之间的同盟和友谊是远东和世界和平的强大因素。
      “劳动报”的社论写道：苏中两国人民极为满意地欢迎这些体现真诚友谊和兄弟联盟的文件。强大的和平民主社会主义阵营中这两个伟大国家的人民的友谊是持久的、牢不可破的。经验证明，苏中联盟具有巨大的生命力，这个联盟是符合苏中两国人民以及世界各国人民的根本利益的。它不仅对中国和苏联的经济发展有巨大的良好的影响，而且对整个世界历史的进程也产生这种影响。苏联和中华人民共和国这个亚洲大国之间的友好关系，是两国根据平等互利、互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的原则实行进一步密切合作的基础。
      “红星报”的社论写道：在真诚友好和互相谅解的空气中进行的苏中会谈表明，在两国日益发展的全面合作方面和对于国际形势的各项问题上，两国的观点是完全一致的。苏中会谈的结果对两国之间的经济和文化合作的进一步发展具有重大的意义。被牢不可破的友谊紧密地团结在一起的苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民正在并肩前进，无私地互相帮助，他们之间的友谊已变成了人类历史上从来没有过的维护和巩固世界和平的巨大力量。
    德意志民主共和国
    柏林民主区各报这两天都以显著地位刊载了中苏会谈公报，以及中苏两国政府的各项联合宣言和联合公报。“每日评论报”十三日在“苏中两国关系进一步巩固”的通栏标题下，以整版篇幅刊载了中苏两国政府的联合宣言和各项联合公报的全文。
  “新德意志报”刊载的题为“苏联和人民中国的联盟日益加强”的文章说：中苏会谈表明世界上两大国家的紧密的、牢不可破的友谊，表明它们竭力保卫和平的决心。苏联对人民中国的建设给予新的巨大的帮助，表明了它对六亿人民的无私的友谊。
  “新时报”着重指出了中苏两国政府在发展全面的合作方面和对于国际形势的各项问题上的意见完全一致。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚的“火花报”、“自由罗马尼亚报”、
  “劳动报”和“青年火花报”十三日都以显著地位登载了中苏会谈公报，并发表社论评论中苏会谈的重大意义。
      “火花报”的社论指出：中苏会谈公报是苏中两国人民伟大友谊与和平意志的再一次光辉的表现。苏中两国政府关于对日本关系问题的联合宣言，是两国政府所主张的根据和平共处的五项原则处理与亚洲各国关系的政策的光辉范例。在谈到苏联将中苏共同使用的旅顺口及其设备、将中苏各股份公司中的苏联股份移交给中国，以及中苏加强科学技术合作等问题时，“火花报”着重说：像这样目的在于促进共同经济高涨的平等及兄弟的互助关系，是民主社会主义阵营各国间的关系的特点。社论最后说：罗马尼亚人民以极大愉快的心情欢迎中苏会谈公报，并把它看作是对加强民主社会主义阵营、缓和国际紧张局势和加强全世界和平的新的重要贡献。
      “自由罗马尼亚报”的社论在谈到中苏两国政府联合宣言中关于朝鲜问题的建议时说：为了解决当前亚洲最迫切问题之一的朝鲜问题，苏中两国政府又提出了新的重要的建议，以使朝鲜问题从停顿状态中有重新获得解决的希望。
      匈牙利
    匈牙利“自由人民报”十二日在第一版刊载了关于中苏举行会谈的公报和中苏两国政府的各项联合宣言与联合公报全文。其他各主要报纸也摘要刊载了这些文件。匈牙利各中央一级报纸都发表了评论中苏会谈结果的社论。
      “自由人民报”在十三日发表社论说：苏联对中国经济建设的援助是一九五零年三亿美元贷款的继续。这种慷慨、全面的援助对于进入大规模社会主义工业化时期的中华人民共和国的意义是不言而喻的。苏中两国政府的联合宣言的每字每句，都证明了两国之间的一致。这些文件首先表明，两国在对付帝国主义的侵略企图上是完全团结一致的。其次，苏联完全支持人民中国对中国领土台湾的合理合法的要求。再次，这些文件还表明，中苏两国政府将尽力促进亚洲未决问题的最后合理的解决。中国在解决中印关系时首先提出的五项原则，在这次苏中联合宣言中已经肯定了下来，这些原则在与一切国家的关系中是普遍有效的。最近美国在东南亚组织了包围和威胁新中国的集团。苏中联合宣言和协定是对这种企图的一个答复。社论强调说：国际形势在发生变化，中国的防御力量加强了。如果帝国主义者认为以暴力干涉中国内政而不会遭到失败，那简直是发疯。苏中同盟已经变成一种亚洲和全世界从未见过的力量和吸引力。为了苏中两国人民的幸福和世界和平的利益，祝这个同盟日益繁荣！
      “匈牙利民族报”在十二日写道：苏中会谈公报具有重大的国际意义。表明苏中两国在一切国际问题上观点完全一致的联合宣言，以及苏联政府给予中华人民共和国政府巨额长期贷款和对中国的企业建设给予新的巨大帮助的协议，证明了苏中友谊是深厚的，这种友谊永远是世界和平的坚强的支柱。
    印度尼西亚
    雅加达报纸十三日以显著地位刊载了中苏会谈的公报以及两国政府的各项联合宣言和联合公报。
  “人民日报”刊载这个消息的标题是：“友好的援助”。“独立报”的标题是：“中国和苏联要以五项原则为基础和亚洲国家建立关系”。“印度尼西亚新闻”用头版头条的地位刊出中苏会谈的公报和各项联合宣言与联合公报。
      日本
    日本舆论热烈评论中苏会谈的结果。苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言，成了日本舆论注意的中心。“北海道新闻”指出，苏中两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言引起了日本商界的许多反应。大多数的商界人士对这个宣言表示了极大的兴趣。这家报纸指出，虽然有许多商界人士对这个宣言采取谨慎的态度，但是他们希望：这个宣言会被用来解决日本和中华人民共和国及苏联的外交关系的问题。这家报纸说：要求改变美国对日政策的呼声日益响亮了。
    左派社会党欢迎苏中两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言，并指出，这个宣言为日本和“苏俄及共产党中国”恢复正常关系提供了一个很好的机会。左派社会党号召日本人民扫除恢复和苏联及中华人民共和国正常关系的道路上的障碍。
      法国
    十二日，巴黎所有的日报都根据莫斯科电台的广播，刊载了苏联和中华人民共和国最近在北京举行会谈的结果。“人道报”详细地报道了中苏会谈公报的内容，并着重指出：苏联和中华人民共和国在一切有关保障亚洲和欧洲各国人民的和平和安全的国际问题上，观点是完全一致的。“解放报”特别醒目地标出了消息中讲到苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府认为有必要在最近的将来召开讨论朝鲜问题的会议那一段。“战斗报”把苏联和中华人民共和国对日本的态度称为“欢迎和好”的政策。
    中苏会谈的消息也成了巴黎各晚报注意的中心。各报指出，这次会谈中所作出的决定具有特别重大的意义。
      “世界报”在指出民主阵营在日内瓦会议上所获得的外交上的胜利之后写道：苏中联合公报中所表明的对“东南亚防务条约”的态度，不仅将得到印度的赞同，而且也将得到拒绝参加东南亚条约组织的大部分东南亚国家的赞同。“亚洲自觉”的呼声可能引起日本某些政界人士对于在亚洲大陆上所出现的新关系中担当某种角色的愿望。
    天主教报纸“十字架晚报”认为，苏中公报是“具有十分重大意义的事件”。
    英国
    十二日英国报纸以大量篇幅报道了中苏会谈公报的内容。大多数报纸都在第一版用大字标题登载了有关中苏两国政府的联合宣言和联合公报的消息。许多报纸还发表了社论，认为中苏两国的新协议很重要。
    意大利
    许多意大利报纸都着重指出了苏中会谈结果的重大意义。
    “团结报”指出，苏中两国会谈所达成的协议，反映了“国际力量对比的根本变化”，这就是：“中国革命的胜利彻底巩固了，年青的中华人民共和国近来获得了国际威望，中苏两国建立了牢不可破的友谊并进行着表现这种友谊的新的合作，最后，目前亚洲形势中这些极重要的因素在国际关系的各方面起着决定性作用。”（据新华社讯）
