    The founding and increasing strength and prosperity of the People's Republic of China have brought boundless joy to the overseas Chinese, who were once called "orphans abroad." They love the motherland, yearn for the motherland, and have returned to the motherland one after another to participate in various constructions and continue their studies. Over the past five years, according to incomplete statistics, a total of approximately 178,000 people have returned from various places, including overseas Chinese of all circles, overseas Chinese youths returning to study, as well as displaced overseas Chinese who were expelled from Malaya, Thailand, and other places, and displaced overseas Chinese who returned due to the disasters of the American war of aggression against Korea.

    The Central People's Government and local people's governments at all levels have given warm reception and care to the returned overseas Chinese, and according to practical and possible conditions, in accordance with the construction spirit of "increasing production, practicing strict economy" and the principle of "self-reliance through production," have organized overseas Chinese to participate in production or have made other appropriate arrangements. Over the past five years, more than 72,100 of the returned overseas Chinese have actively responded to the state's call for "self-reliance through production," relying on their own efforts and the mutual assistance of relatives and fellow villagers to return home for production, engage in industrial and commercial undertakings, or participate in work; approximately 45,000 students have been assigned to study in schools at various levels in various places, or are attending make-up classes at overseas Chinese secondary schools in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Fujian; and 60,876 people who are indeed in difficulty and need government assistance have also been appropriately resettled by the overseas Chinese affairs agencies of the people's governments at all levels. To this end, the state has drawn a group of staff and allocated considerable funds to establish special institutions such as overseas Chinese service stations in Guangzhou, Shantou, Hainan, Fujian, Andong, Tianjin, and other places to solve the practical difficulties of overseas Chinese and mobilize the people in the overseas Chinese areas to help them settle down and start their businesses.

    Among the more than 60,000 returned overseas Chinese who needed government assistance, there are now more than 25,000 people who have a home to return to and have sent funds back to their hometowns to participate in production. Under the care and consideration of the people's government, they have all settled down and are actively engaged in labor and production. According to investigations in Jieyang, Puning, Fengshun, Bao'an, and other counties in Guangdong Province, after the overseas Chinese returned to their hometowns, with the assistance of the county people's government in life and production, the vast majority of them were able to unite and help each other with the local farmers and actively engage in labor and production. The Bao'an County People's Government of Guangdong Province often sends cadres to the countryside to visit returned overseas Chinese and help them develop production. The early returned overseas Chinese actively participated in the land reform movement and carried out the great struggle against the feudal land system together with the peasants, and obtained land in the land reform. The returned overseas Chinese who originally did not know how to farm have gradually learned farming techniques through several years of training, and have solved the difficulties in production and increased production through mutual assistance and cooperation, and their lives have gradually become prosperous. For example, Lin Mingzuo, a returned overseas Chinese from Gulou Village, Haicheng County, Fujian Province, had been abroad for fourteen or fifteen years and only returned to China in October last year. Soon after, he joined a mutual aid team. At first, because he did not know how to farm, the mutual aid team often helped him at the team's production technology exchange meetings or in the fields. He himself also studied diligently and quickly learned techniques such as planting beans and transplanting rice seedlings, and cultivated with precision and care. With the increase in production investment, his family's early rice production increased by 50% this year. After the harvest, he sold a total of 1,416 catties of surplus grain, 230 catties of peanuts, and 166 catties of soybeans to the state; bought a large castrated bull and a horse, built a pigsty, and raised four pigs. He also plans to build a new house after the late rice harvest is over. With the assistance of the people's government, the lives of returned overseas Chinese engaged in handicrafts and freelance occupations have also been guaranteed. For example, the Guangzhou No. 1 Candy Production Group, which started construction in mid-February this year, was organized by returned overseas Chinese and their families, relying on the shares raised by the members themselves and the loans provided by the people's government. The group has a total of twenty-nine people, including eighteen returned overseas Chinese and eleven family members of overseas Chinese. Except for six people who knew the technology, the rest of the group members were all laymen in candy production. However, after a short period of training before starting work, these people have also mastered the necessary production techniques and knowledge. Female group members who have been trained can now pack 50 catties of candy per person per day, and the entire group can produce 600 catties of various candies such as milk candy, fruit juice candy, and coconut candy per day.

    After returning to China, the people's government, in order to enable the homeless overseas Chinese to produce for self-reliance, settle down and start their businesses, in addition to resettling more than 10,000 overseas Chinese who returned from Korea in Tangyuan, Mishan, Linkou, Keshan, Fuyu, and other counties in Heilongjiang Province to engage in agricultural production, also successively established four overseas Chinese farms in Wanqingsha, Dongguan County, Lufeng County, Xinglong Town, Wanning County, Hainan Island, and Changshan, Yunxiao County, Fujian Province, resettling more than 4,100 people. At the beginning of this year, Wanqingsha Overseas Chinese Farm was merged with the Zhuhai County State-owned Farm to become a state-owned mechanized farm. The Xinglong Farm on Hainan Island has now cultivated more than 8,000 mu of land, with 2,448 farm members. Thanks to the active leadership of the Party and the government and the efforts of all farm members and cadres, the farm is basically close to self-sufficiency. Among the more than 4,000 overseas Chinese who participated in the farm, the vast majority of them originally did not know how to farm. After more than two years of study, they are now able to master agricultural production techniques, and labor models have emerged. In February this year, Xinglong Farm spent 20 days reclaiming 346 mu of wasteland. Several members of the "Farm Commando Team," which overfulfilled its task, had never participated in agricultural labor abroad in the past, but after several years of training, they are now production experts. For example, the eight people in the third team of the commando team dug more than 50 zhang of ditches in five days. The female commando team members from the group's family backgrounds worked the same as the men and received equal pay. Chen Qing, an overseas Chinese who returned from Malaya after being abroad for more than 20 years and is now over 50 years old, voluntarily signed up to be a cook in the team. Sometimes, he carried a lunch basket and walked three or four miles to deliver meals to the construction site. He often said to people, "In order to build a collective prosperous life, any difficulty can be overcome." This year, the early rice of Xinglong Farm yielded 530 catties per mu, exceeding the output of ordinary local farmers by 230 catties.

    In the past few years, about 15,000 returned overseas Chinese have been introduced to work in government agencies, enterprises, factories, schools, and other departments. The vast majority of them are working with peace of mind, studying hard, and some have received rewards and commendations from their units. For example, Gan Buzhen, a returned overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia, returned to China in December 1950, and in the spring of the following year, he was introduced by the people's government to participate in basic construction at the 101 construction site in Fuzhou. Because he was willing to work actively and study hard, he changed the old "squint drilling method" to the "straight drilling method," creating a new record of drilling two meters and six inches with one row of artillery, which increased work efficiency by nearly one time. He has transformed from an ordinary worker with no expertise to an advanced worker engaged in creative labor. He is also willing to study hard and take care of public property, and is universally admired by the workers at the construction site. For the few elderly people who are sick and homeless, and children who are homeless, especially orphans who tragically lost their parents in the crazy bombing by the American aggressors in Korea, the people's governments at all levels have made proper arrangements for their resettlement and care. There are now more than 200 children and elderly and sick overseas Chinese in production and education centers, nursing homes, and orphanages.

    The work of receiving, resettling, and handling returned overseas Chinese in the past few years has been carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government and with the assistance of the masses of the people, and thus has achieved certain results and gradually corrected the chaotic phenomenon and other shortcomings in the early stages of the work. In the future, the overseas Chinese affairs agencies in various places, according to the people's government's policy of caring for overseas Chinese and organizing returned overseas Chinese to actively participate in production for "self-reliance through production," will achieve more achievements in their work. At the same time, the overseas Chinese affairs agencies in various places will further strengthen the education and assistance to returned overseas Chinese, so that they can fully understand the country's general task in the transitional period, work harder in production, study, and work, and play a greater role in the country's socialist construction cause.

    祖国对归国侨胞的安置
    高启源
    中华人民共和国的成立和日益强大繁荣，给过去被称为“海外孤儿”的华侨带来无限的喜悦。他们热爱祖国，向往祖国，纷纷回到祖国参加各种建设和继续升学。五年来，由各地归国的各界华侨和归国求学的华侨青年，以及由马来亚、泰国等地被驱逐回国的难侨和因受美国侵朝战争灾害而归国的难侨，据不完全的统计，共约十七万八千多人。
    中央人民政府及地方各级人民政府，对回到祖国的侨胞，都给予热情的接待和关怀，并根据实际可能的条件，按照“增加生产、厉行节约”的建设精神和“生产自救”的方针，组织侨胞参加生产，或作了其他适当的安置。五年来，归国侨胞中的七万二千一百多人，积极响应国家“生产自救”的号召，依靠自力和亲朋乡里的互助互济，回家生产，或经营工商各业，或参加工作；四万五千人左右的学生，都经分配在各地各级学校学习，或正在北京、广州、福建的华侨中等补习学校补习功课；确有困难、必需政府协助的六万零八百七十六人，也经人民政府各级侨务机关作了适当的安置。国家为此曾抽出一批工作人员，拨出相当的经费，在广州、汕头、海南、福建、安东、天津等地，先后设立了华侨服务站等专门机构，解决侨胞的实际困难，并动员侨区人民帮助他们安家立业。
    必须政府协助的六万多名归国华侨中，有家可归、经资送回乡参加生产的，现在已有二万五千多人。他们在人民政府的关怀和照顾下，都安居下来，积极劳动生产。根据广东省揭阳、普宁、丰顺、宝安等县的调查，侨胞回乡后，经县人民政府给予生活上和生产上的协助，绝大多数都能和当地农民团结互助，积极劳动生产。广东省宝安县人民政府，经常派干部下乡访问归国侨胞，帮助他们发展生产。早期归国的侨胞曾积极参加了土地改革运动，和农民一起进行了伟大的反对封建土地制度的斗争，在土地改革中分得了土地。原来不会耕种的归国侨胞，经过几年的锻炼，也逐渐学会了耕作技术，并通过互助合作的道路，解决了生产上的困难，增加了生产，生活逐渐富裕起来。例如：福建省海澄县古楼村的归侨林明座，出国十四、五年，去年十月间才归国。不久他就参加了互助组，开初因为不会耕种，互助组就经常在组的生产技术交流会上或田间帮助他，他自己也勤学苦练，很快地学会了种豆、插秧等技术，耕作得又精又细。再加上生产投资的增加，因此他家今年的早稻增产了五成，收成后共卖了余粮一千四百一十六斤谷、二百三十斤花生、一百六十六斤黄豆给国家；买进了一头大犍牛和一匹马，盖了一座猪舍，养了四头猪，等晚稻大忙过后还要建新屋。从事手工业、自由职业的归国侨胞，在人民政府的协助下，生活也有了保障。例如：依靠组员自己筹集的股金和人民政府给予的贷款，在今年二月中旬开工的广州市第一糖果生产小组，就是由归侨和侨眷组织的。全组二十九人，其中归侨十八人，侨眷十一人。组内除了六个人会技术外，其余的组员对于糖果生产都是外行。但是，这些人在开工前经过短期训练，也都掌握了必要的生产技术和知识。经过训练的女组员每日每人已能包装糖果五十斤，全组每日可生产牛奶糖、果汁糖、椰子糖等各种糖果六百斤。
    无家可归的侨胞，在回国后，人民政府为了使他们能够生产自救，安家立业，除在黑龙江省的汤原、密山、林口、克山、富裕等县安置了一万多名从朝鲜归来的侨胞从事农业生产以外，又先后在广东省东莞县万顷沙、陆丰县、海南岛万宁县兴隆镇和福建省云霄县的常山，创办了四个华侨农场，安置了四千一百多人。万顷沙华侨农场，今年初已和珠海县国营农场合并为国营机械农场。海南岛兴隆农场，目前已垦殖土地八千多亩，场员有二千四百四十八人；由于党和政府的积极领导和全体场员和干部的努力，这个农场已基本上接近自给自足。在参加农场的四千多名侨胞中，绝大部分原是不会耕种的，经过两年多来的学习，现在都能掌握农业生产技术，并出现了劳动模范。兴隆农场今年二月间用二十天时间开荒三百四十六亩，在超额完成任务的“农场突击队”中，就有几个队员过去在国外从来没有参加过农业劳动，但经过几年的锻炼，现在都已是生产能手。例如突击队第三组八个人五天就挖了五十多丈长的沟，组内家庭妇女出身的女突击队员和男子同样工作，领同等的报酬。出国二十多年的现在已五十多岁的从马来亚归国的华侨陈晴，自愿报名来队里当炊事员，有时，他挑着饭篮走三、四里路把饭菜送到工地去。他常对人说：“为了建设集体富裕的生活，什么困难都克服得了。”今年，兴隆农场的早稻，每亩产五百三十斤，超过当地一般农民产量二百三十斤。
    几年来，归国侨胞被介绍到机关、企业、工厂、学校等部门就业的约有一万五千多人。他们绝大多数都安心工作，努力学习，并有一些人得到本单位的奖励和表扬，如南洋归侨甘步真，一九五○年十二月回国，第二年春天由人民政府介绍到福州市一○一工地参加基本建设。由于他肯积极工作、苦心钻研，把老旧的“斜眼钻进法”改为“直眼钻进法”，创造了一排炮打钻二公尺六寸的新纪录，工作效率提高了近一倍，从原来毫无专长的普通工人，锻炼成为从事着创造性劳动的先进工人。他又肯努力学习，爱护公共财物，受到工地工人的普遍钦佩。对于少数有病无家可归的老人，无家可归的儿童，特别是在朝鲜惨遭美国侵略者疯狂滥炸而失掉了爹娘的孤儿，各地人民政府都作了妥善的安置  和抚养。现在在生产教养院、养老院、孤儿院的儿童和年老有病的侨胞，共有二百多人。
    几年来接待、安置和处理归国侨胞的工作，是在共产党和人民政府的领导下和人民群众的协助下进行的，因而取得了一定的成绩，逐步纠正了工作初期的忙乱现象和其他缺点。今后，各地侨务机构根据人民政府关怀侨胞、组织归国侨胞积极参加生产进行“生产自救”的方针，将会在工作中获得更多的成就。同时，各地侨务机构也将会进一步加强对归国侨胞的教育和帮助，使他们充分了解国家在过渡时期的总任务，更加努力生产、学习和工作，在国家社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用。
