Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 19th: Viet Nam News Agency reported on the 19th that Chai Song, the representative of the General Headquarters of the Khmer Resistance Forces participating in the Cambodian Joint Armistice Committee, stated in response to a question from a Viet Nam News Agency reporter regarding the participation of Cambodian citizens in national public life: On September 15th, the General Headquarters of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces issued a communique stating that "the Royal Government does not recognize anyone claiming to belong to the Khmer Resistance Forces."

Chai Song said: We believe that this communique seriously violates the agreements reached by both parties. It denies the agreement solemnly concluded in Geneva by the representatives of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and the representatives of the General Headquarters of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Command of the Vietnamese Volunteer Forces.

Chai Song continued: This communique has spread unrest among the Khmer fighters who have already been demobilized. Just as the Khmer fighters were conscientiously and correctly implementing the armistice agreement, laying down their weapons, and returning to their hometowns, preparing to fulfill the duties of citizens of a free country, they felt that the Royal Government did not want them to participate in national public life due to the Royal Government's policy towards the resistance personnel.

Chai Song pointed out: In accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords, participation in Cambodian national public life is not only the task of the Khmer Resistance Forces, but also the common task of the entire Cambodian people, including the Royal Government, former Khmer resistance personnel, and all other citizens regardless of religious belief, social class, or political affiliation.

Chai Song said: In order to accomplish this task, we suggest that the Royal Government solve the following urgent problems:

	(1) Guarantee that all citizens enjoy the freedom of speech and freedom to participate in general elections as stipulated by the Royal Government's constitution; immediately stop all propaganda aimed at denying the Khmer Resistance Forces and excluding these forces and other patriots from the government's laws; severely punish those who have committed acts of arresting, torturing, and mistreating demobilized Khmer fighters and their families, which violate the armistice agreement.
	(2) Issue citizen certificates to all residents regardless of religious belief, political party, social class, ethnicity, or political affiliation, so that all citizens can live in a peaceful and safe environment.
	(3) Continue to release all prisoners of war and detained civilians, including the 300,000 civilians who were forcibly concentrated near military strongholds and bunkers.

Chai Song concluded: As for us Khmer resistance personnel, we have fought armed struggles for peace and national independence in the past. Today, we are very willing to respect the spirit of peace in the Geneva Accords, implement the provisions for the participation of all citizens in national public life, and build a peaceful, independent, and prosperous Cambodia.

    高棉抗战部队代表发表谈话
    提出柬埔寨公民参加国家生活的三点建议
    【新华社二十一日讯】越南通讯社十九日讯：参加柬埔寨联合停战委员会的高棉抗战部队总司令部代表柴松，在答复越南通讯社记者关于柬埔寨公民参加国家公共生活问题时发表谈话说：九月十五日，柬埔寨王国军队总司令部发表一项公报，其中说到“王国政府对于任何自称属于高棉抗战部队的人都不予以承认。”
    柴松说：我们认为这项公报严重地破坏了双方所达成的协议。它否认了柬埔寨王国部队的代表在日内瓦和高棉抗战部队总司令部及越南志愿人员司令部的代表所庄严缔结的协定。
    柴松接着说：这项公报在已经复员了的高棉战士中间散播了不安。正当高棉战士们认真地和正确地履行停战协定，放下武器，回到他们故乡，准备尽到一个自由国家的公民的职责时，由于王国政府对抗战人员的政策，他们感到王国政府想不让他们参加国家公共生活。
    柴松指出：依照日内瓦协定的精神，参加柬埔寨国家公共生活不单是高棉抗战部队的任务，而是整个柬埔寨人民，包括王国政府、前高棉抗战人员以及其他不分宗教信仰、社会阶级和政治关系的全体公民的共同任务。
    柴松说：为了完成这项任务，我们建议王国政府解决下面的几个迫切的问题：
    （一）保证全体公民享有王国政府宪法所规定的言论自由和参加普选的自由；立即制止旨在否认高棉抗战部队和排斥这些部队和其他爱国人士于政府法律之外的各项宣传；严厉惩办那些犯有逮捕、拷打和虐待已经复员的高棉战士及他们的家属这种违反停战协定行为的人。
      （二）不分宗教信仰、政党、社会阶层、民族或政治关系，发给全体居民以公民证，以使全体公民可以生活在和平与安全的环境里。
      （三）继续释放全部战俘和被拘平民，包括三十万被强迫集中在军事据点和碉堡附近的平民。
    柴松最后说：在我们高棉抗战人员方面，我们过去曾为和平和民族独立而进行过武装斗争。今天，我们十分愿意尊重日内瓦协定的和平精神，实现全体公民参加国家公共生活的规定，并且建设一个和平、独立和繁荣的柬埔寨。
