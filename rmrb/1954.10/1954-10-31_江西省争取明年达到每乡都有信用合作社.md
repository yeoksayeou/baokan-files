Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, October 29th: The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held the first provincial credit cooperation work conference from October 11th to 22nd. The CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee proposed to the conference a plan to basically achieve credit cooperatives in every township throughout the province in 1955. By the end of 1955, the province will have developed to 9,500 credit cooperatives, and the share capital and deposits are required to reach more than three times the current level. It is required to organize 75% of the total number of farmer households into credit cooperatives.

Jiangxi Province now has 4,365 credit cooperatives and 5,584 credit mutual aid groups. There are more than 2.68 million credit cooperative members, and approximately 1.55 million farmer households have joined credit cooperatives, accounting for 38% of the total number of farmer households in the province. These credit cooperative organizations have been warmly supported by the broad masses of farmers due to their credit business.

The meeting believed that: since credit cooperatives have a considerable foundation and experience in running cooperatives in the province, and credit cooperatives have had a good impact in the vast rural areas, and a large number of cadres have been trained over the past year, vigorously developing credit cooperatives is not only necessary but also possible. In order to make the development of credit cooperatives work better, the meeting specifically determined the practice of "training a batch, developing a batch, and consolidating a batch," and put forward different requirements for different regions. The meeting also carefully studied many specific issues in future work.

    江西省争取明年达到每乡都有信用合作社
    【新华社南昌二十九日电】　中国共产党江西省委员会在十月十一日到二十二日召开全省第一次信用合作工作会议。中共江西省委向会议提出了一九五五年在全省范围内基本上作到乡乡有信用合作社的计划。到一九五五年年底全省将发展到九千五百个信用合作社，股金和存款要求达到等于现在的三倍以上，要求把占农民总户数百分之七十五的农户组织到信用合作社里来。
    江西全省现在已有信用合作社四千三百六十五个，信用互助组五千五百八十四个，信用合作社社
  （组）员达二百六十八万多人，参加信用合作社的农户约有一百五十五万农户，占全省农民总户数的百分之三十八。这些信用合作组织由于开展了信贷业务，受到了广大农民的热烈拥护。
    会议认为：由于信用合作社在全省已有了相当基础和办社经验，信用合作社在广大农村中已产生了良好影响，以及一年来训练了大批干部等，因此大力发展信用合作社不仅是需要，而且是可能的。为了使发展信用合作社的工作作得更好，会议具体确定了“训练一批、发展一批、巩固一批”的作法，并对不同地区提出了不同的要求。会议对今后工作中许多具体问题也作了仔细的研究。
