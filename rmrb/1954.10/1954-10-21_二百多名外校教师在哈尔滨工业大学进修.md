    This semester, more than two hundred teachers from other schools are studying at Harbin Institute of Technology. They are lecturers and teaching assistants from more than a dozen universities and colleges, such as Tsinghua University, Jiaotong University, and Northeast Institute of Technology, and more than a dozen secondary vocational schools, such as the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School of the First Ministry of Machine Building. These teachers will spend a year studying the courses they teach at their original schools. Some will study new courses they have not taught before, and some will do course design or graduation design during their studies, so that they can guide students to do this work after returning to their original schools.
    These teachers are very enthusiastic about learning. In order to help them quickly improve their professional skills, the departments and related teaching and research sections of Harbin Institute of Technology have appointed assistant department directors and deputy directors of teaching and research sections to be specifically responsible for guiding their further studies. The teaching and research sections have also formulated further study plans based on the teachers' professional level and the requirements of their original schools. Classes have now been organized according to the courses they are studying, with some attending classes with fourth- and fifth-year undergraduates, and others having classes opened separately for them.
    Harbin Institute of Technology began running teacher training courses last year, and more than forty teachers have now completed their training plans.

    二百多名外校教师在哈尔滨工业大学进修
    这学期，在哈尔滨工业大学进修的外校教师有二百多名。他们是清华大学、交通大学、东北工学院等十几个高等学校和第一机械工业部北京机器制造学校等十几个中等专业学校的讲师、助教。这些教师将在一年内进修他们在原校讲授的课程，有的要进修一门过去没有教过的新的课程，有的还要在进修期间做课程设计或毕业设计，以便进修后回原校指导学生做这些工作。
    这些教师的学习情绪都很高。为了帮助他们迅速地提高业务水平，哈尔滨工业大学各系和有关的教研室都指定了助理系主任、教研室副主任专门负责指导他们的进修，教研室还根据这些教师的业务水平和原校对他们的要求，拟定了进修计划。现在已按他们所学的课程编好班，有的和本科四、五年级学生一起听课，有的给他们单独开课。
    哈尔滨工业大学从去年开始举办师资进修班，到现在已有四十多名教师完成了进修计划。
