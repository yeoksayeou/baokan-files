    The Significance of Strengthening Ideological Work as Seen from the Planned Supply of Cotton Cloth
    By our reporter An Gang
    Throughout the country, the people are implementing the order of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, and planned supply of cotton cloth was implemented on September 15th. The people of Shenyang, like people in other parts of the country, warmly support this important measure. The work of planned supply has been carried out smoothly, the market is stable, and good results have been achieved.
    From the process of implementing planned cotton cloth supply in Shenyang, two different approaches can be seen. One is to correctly combine the central government's policies with the actual conditions of the region and unit, strengthen ideological work within and outside the Party, and further establish socialist thought among the masses and raise the socialist political consciousness of the broad masses through the specific measures of implementing planned cotton cloth supply. Units that have done this have achieved good results.
    The other is that individual regions and departments have adopted a relaxed leadership or a generalized approach. In the work of planned supply of cotton cloth, they have neglected or weakened the Party's ideological work among the people. In these places, ideological confusion among the masses has been created to varying degrees.
    We must put strengthening the Party's ideological work in the first place. We can draw this conclusion from the problems reflected in this planned cotton cloth supply.
    First, we must establish the leading ideology of socialism. We must fully estimate that the implementation of the planned supply policy will inevitably launch a struggle between socialist ideology and capitalist ideology to varying degrees. Only when the Party's policies and socialist ideology are grasped by the masses and become a material force can the work be done well. At the beginning of the implementation of planned cotton cloth supply, some people were not clear about the question of "Is planned supply good, or is free trade good?" They did not draw a clear line between socialism and capitalism on this issue. They did not understand that only by having the state make a planned distribution of important materials related to the people's economic life can it be guaranteed that it will not be manipulated by speculators, that the needs of the people will be guaranteed, and that socialist construction can be carried out normally. When the order for planned cotton cloth supply in Shenyang City was transmitted to the factories, two factories immediately sent people to the manager's office of the Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company to request to buy cloth. The Mining Machinery Factory sent people to the Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company on the 12th to request a wholesale of 300 bolts of cloth, believing that this was to take care of the interests of the workers. After the person who came returned, the secretary of the factory's general branch said to the comrades of the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company on the phone: "It is best to sell it to us, we must take care of the workers." The Screw Factory signed a contract with the Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company on August 23 to buy 700 bolts of cloth, but had not paid for and picked up the goods; when they heard about the planned supply of cotton cloth, they sent people to the company to pick up the goods. At that time, it had been decided to stop wholesale supply to consumers. The Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company explained the reasons why they could not pick up the goods. The person who came said that the goods should be given if the contract was signed. The company comrade said: You did not pay and pick up the goods in the past, why are you so anxious now? The contract must also obey the laws of the country. Some factories (such as Machine Factory No. 2) wrote to the Municipal Finance and Economics Commission after receiving the notice of planned cotton cloth supply, requesting to buy cloth for the workers.
    Of course, the above-mentioned people are not resisting the implementation of the Party and government policies, but this shows that their views on planned supply are confused. For example, they want to "take care of the workers," but they have forgotten that only by earnestly implementing the Party and the state's policy of planned supply of cotton cloth can the workers truly be taken care of, because leaving the Party's policy and talking about "taking care of the workers" and "free trade" can only violate the current and long-term interests of the working class. The broad masses of the people deeply realize from their personal experience that only reasonable planned supply by the government and exclusion of speculators' manipulation are in line with the true interests of the people in the current situation. This can be understood by looking at the market situation after the implementation of planned supply. The market in Shenyang has been very stable from the day the planned supply of cotton cloth was implemented on the 15th until now. People said: "We have suffered losses from unscrupulous merchants for a long time. The cloth becomes more and more expensive when the season changes. After liberation, the People's Government stabilized prices, and we were relieved, but we were always worried about unscrupulous merchants taking advantage of loopholes. It is good to implement planned supply. We have cloth purchase tickets in our hands. Whenever we need cloth, we will buy it. The government has insured us." This is the enthusiastic response of the Party's correct policy among the masses, and it is also the simple thinking in people's lives. The task of the Party's ideological work is to use socialist thought to explain our economic life, promote the positive factors in the people's thinking, overcome the negative factors, and lead the masses forward. All tailism thinking will cause inestimable losses to the work.
    Second, from this planned cotton cloth supply work, it is once again proved that the ideological style of burying oneself in economic business, not asking about politics, or not being able to correctly combine politics with economics is wrong. We must do economic work under the guidance of socialist thought and the Party's policies. When the Shenyang Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company made its first mobilization report on the planned supply of cotton cloth, most of the talk was about business issues. After listening to it, everyone only studied some procedures and methods for selling goods, and discussed it for half a month and held more than ten meetings, but did not really touch on ideological issues; later, after mobilizing from a political perspective, everyone realized that state-owned commercial departments are socialist fortresses in the country's social life, and everyone should understand and consciously implement the policies. Some salespersons in the Municipal Department Store did not understand their political responsibilities and only lowered their heads to measure cloth. They did not care when they saw that some of the masses buying cloth had ideological doubts. Later, they changed this method and sold cloth while answering questions from the masses, which was welcomed by the masses. This fact shows that the staff of socialist enterprises should also cultivate themselves to become political workers at the same time. The idea of simply doing technical business work, and even seeing oneself as just a "business person," is wrong.
    Some economic work leaders also have a view of neglecting political work. For example, some people only look at the problem from the perspective of supply and demand, while ignoring the perspective of political leadership. In this planned cotton cloth supply, some economic work leaders believed that "taking out tens of thousands of bolts of cloth" could solve the problem. Under the dominance of this idea, they simply opposed the idea of hoarding and being reluctant to sell. This is actually abandoning the point of view of leadership, and is a one-sided implementation of the Party's policies. As a result, it is bound to be a lack of mass viewpoint. Individual stores belonging to the Shenyang Municipal Department Store once stopped selling sweets and other retail outlets to be used as places to sell cloth, and increased the number of salespeople and ticket writers to sell cloth. This practice of neglecting political work resulted in ideological confusion among some of the masses and fueled speculation in other commodities. After the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee discovered this situation, it immediately stopped it, and quickly restored the market to normal order. It can be seen from this that all economic work must reflect the Party's leading role, otherwise it can only cause great difficulties for the work.
    The third issue is that propaganda work plays a major role in ensuring the implementation of the Party's policies. Propaganda work should achieve a unity of principle and flexibility, and should not be satisfied with general calls, nor should it be thought that it can be done with just one transmission. Some organs and units only read out the propaganda points issued by the higher authorities to the masses, which is far from enough. The power of propaganda work lies in closely combining the thoughts and lives of the people, otherwise it will be impossible to move people's hearts. For example, there is no serious situation of supply falling short of demand in the Shenyang market at present, but some comrades have excessively publicized the situation of supply falling short of demand, resulting in the misconception of some people. We should explain the national situation and the general development trend to the masses, but at the same time, we must combine it with the actual local situation and solve the most pressing problems in real life: such as putting forward some correct views by combining the political and economic significance of planned supply with the people's lives; such as putting forward the role and actions of party members and the working class in the implementation of planned supply based on the ideological situation inside and outside the party; such as the explanation of some supply methods that the local masses are particularly concerned about, etc. The Party organization should grasp the new situations and new problems that arise in the movement to organize propaganda. In this planned cotton cloth supply work, some places only put forward "contracting propaganda", and rarely guided and supervised the propaganda plans and contents of grassroots organizations, and did not well check the propaganda quality of grassroots organizations. The Party's policies became only two or three sentences when they were passed down. This resulted in one-sidedness and simplification in propaganda.
    Why do some places neglect propaganda work? This is mainly because some comrades have adopted a rough and careless attitude towards this major economic and political measure of planned cotton cloth supply. Some people feel that the planned supply of grain and edible oil has been carried out very smoothly, and this planned cotton cloth supply is not a big problem. They have forgotten that the work of planned supply is not a simple administrative work. It embodies the basic policy thinking of the Party and the government. The task of the Party organization is to combine it with the people's lives and become the power of action. This is serious ideological work. Some comrades in the factory have a narrow view of ideological work, thinking that only those issues related to production can be said to be engaged in ideological work, and other work has nothing to do with ideological work. This view is not comprehensive. The Party's ideological work should be combined with the people's economic and political life in any case. The implementation of planned cotton cloth supply will inevitably cause some new changes in people's daily lives. This is a progressive and upward development change, but it is impossible for people to recognize and get used to it all at once. The task of ideological work is to improve people's national concept, so that they can correctly understand the changes in their lives, consciously support the measures of the Party and the government, and this will inevitably promote the people's production enthusiasm and creativity.
    From this planned cotton cloth supply work, we can fully see the serious significance of ideological work. Many grassroots Party organizations are not familiar with or do not know how to do ideological work. This is the root cause of the failure to fully exert the role of ideological leadership. Some grassroots Party organizations regard the Party's leadership only as general calls and empty guarantees, thinking that there will be no problem if the discipline is announced and some measures are taken from the organizational point of view. This view is one-sided and harmful. It leads people to be fascinated by the simplified use of administrative methods to do the Party's work and neglects the detailed and in-depth ideological work.

    从棉布计划供应看加强思想工作的意义
    本报记者　安岗
    全国各地执行中央人民政府政务院的命令，在九月十五日实行了棉布的计划供应。沈阳市人民像全国其他地方的人民一样，热烈拥护这一重要措施。计划供应的工作进行得很顺利，市场稳定，收到了良好的效果。
    从沈阳市实行棉布计划供应的过程中，可以看到两种不同的作法。一种是正确地把中央的政策同本地区、本单位的实际情况结合起来，在党内外加强思想工作，通过实行棉布计划供应的具体措施，进一步在群众中树立社会主义思想，提高广大群众的社会主义政治觉悟，凡是这样作的单位，都取得了良好的成绩。
    另一种是在个别地区、部门采取了放松领导或是一般化的作法。他们在棉布计划供应工作中忽视或减弱了党在人民群众中的思想工作。这些地方都曾在不同程度上，造成了群众的思想混乱。
    必须把加强党的思想工作放在第一位。我们从这次棉布计划供应所反映的问题中可以得出这个结论。
    第一、必须树立社会主义的领导思想。要充分估计到：执行计划供应的政策，必然会在不同程度上展开社会主义思想同资本主义思想的斗争。只有党的政策和社会主义思想掌握了群众，成为物质力量，才能把工作搞好。开始实行棉布计划供应时，有些人对“计划供应好，还是自由买卖好”这样一个问题认识不清楚。他们在这个问题上没有划清社会主义与资本主义的界限。他们不了解：只有把有关人民经济生活的重要物资由国家作有计划的分配，才能保障它不受投机分子的操纵，才能保障人民的需要，才能正常地进行社会主义建设。沈阳市棉布计划供应的命令传到工厂时，马上就有两个工厂派人到市花纱布公司经理室要求买布，矿山机器厂在十二日派人来市花纱布公司要求批发给三百匹布，他们认为这样作是为了照顾工人利益。来人回去后，厂总支书记在电话中向花纱布公司同志表示：“最好还是卖给我们，咱们要照顾工人”。螺丝钉厂在八月二十三日向市花纱布公司订了买七百匹布的合同，但一直没有交钱取货；及至听到计划供应棉布时，他们派人到公司取货，当时已决定停止对消费者按批发供应，市花纱布公司说明不能提货的理由，来人说，订了合同就应给货，公司同志说：你们过去不交款不取货，为什么现在这样着急，合同也要服从国家的法律。有的工厂（如机器二厂）在得到棉布计划供应通知后，就写信给市财政经济委员会，要求给工人买布。
    当然以上这些人并不是抵抗党和政府政策的实施，但，这却表明他们对计划供应的看法是混乱的。譬如他们要“照顾工人”，可是忘记了只有切实执行党和国家棉布计划供应的政策，才能真正地照顾工人，因为离开了党的政策，空谈什么“照顾工人”“自由买卖”，就只能违反工人阶级目前的和长远的利益。广大人民从切身体验中深切地认识到：在目前情况下只有由政府合理地计划供应，排斥投机分子的操纵，才是符合人民的真正利益。这只要看一看实行计划供应后的市场情况就明白了。沈阳市从十五日实行棉布计划供应那天起一直到现在，市场很平稳。人们说：“我们过去长期吃奸商的亏，越到换季的时候布就越贵。解放后人民政府平稳了物价，我们是安心了，可是总还耽心奸商钻空子。实行计划供应就好了。我们手里有了购布票，什么时候用布，就什么时候去买，政府替我们保了险。”这是党的正确政策在群众中所获得的热烈反应，也是人民生活中朴素的思想。党的思想工作任务就是要用社会主义思想去阐明我们的经济生活，发扬人民思想中的积极因素，克服消极因素，领导群众前进。一切尾巴主义的思想都会给工作造成不可估计的损失。
    第二、从这次棉布计划供应工作中，再次证明，那种埋首经济业务，不问政治，或是不能把政治同经济正确结合的思想作风都是不对的。必须在社会主义思想和党的政策指导下来作经济工作。沈阳市花纱布公司第一次作棉布计划供应的动员报告时，谈的大部是业务问题，大家听了后只是研究一些卖货的手续和方法，讨论了半个月，开了十几次会，并没有真正接触到思想问题；后来从政治上作动员，大家才认识到国营商业部门是国家社会生活中的社会主义堡垒，每个人都应当懂得和自觉地执行政策。市百货公司有的营业员由于不了解自己的政治责任，只是低着头量布，看到某些买布的群众思想上有疑问也没有去管，后来改变了这个办法，
  一面卖布，一面解答群众的问题，受到群众的欢迎。这一事实说明，社会主义性质企业的工作人员都应当同时培养自己成为政治工作人员，那种单纯作技术业务工作，甚至把自己只是看成“作买卖的人”的思想是错误的。
    有些经济工作领导人员也有一种忽视政治工作的看法，如有人单纯从供求关系上看问题，而忽略了从政治领导的观点去看问题。在这次棉布计划供应中，有的经济工作领导人员认为：“拿出几万匹布”就可以解决问题。在这种思想支配下，他们单纯反对惜售思想。这实际上是放弃领导的观点，是片面地执行党的政策，结果，必然是缺乏群众观点。沈阳市百货公司所属的个别商店曾经停止糖果等门市改作卖布的地方，增加了很多营业员和写票员去卖布。这种忽视政治工作的做法，结果引起了某些群众的思想混乱，助长了对其他商品的投机。沈阳市委发现这种情况后立即予以制止，很快使市场恢复正常秩序。由此可见，一切经济工作都必须体现党的领导作用，否则便只能使工作遭受很大的困难。
    第三个问题是：宣传工作对于保证贯彻执行党的政策有着重大的作用。宣传工作应该作到原则性同灵活性的统一，不能只满足于一般性的号召，也不能认为传达一次就可了事。有些机关单位只是按照上级发的宣传要点向群众宣读，这是非常不够的。宣传工作的力量就在于紧密地结合人民群众的思想和生活，否则就不可能打动人心。譬如沈阳市市场目前并没有出现供不应求的严重情况，有些同志却过多地宣传了供不应求，结果造成一些人的错觉。我们应当把全国的情况和总的发展趋势向群众作交代，但同时还必须结合当地实际情况，解决现实生活中最迫切的问题：如把计划供应的政治经济意义同人民生活结合起来提出一些正确的看法；如根据党内外思想情况提出党员和工人阶级在实行计划供应中的作用和行动；如对当地群众特别关心的一些供应方法的解释等。党的组织要把握运动中发生的新情况、新问题来组织宣传。有些地方在这次棉布计划供应工作中只提出了“包干宣传”，很少指导和监督基层组织的宣传计划和内容，没有很好地检查基层组织的宣传质量，党的政策传到下面就只变成了二、三句话。以致造成宣传上的片面性和简单化。
    为什么有些地方忽视宣传工作呢？这主要是因为若干同志对于棉布计划供应这一重大的经济政治措施采取了粗枝大叶疏忽大意的态度。有人觉得粮食食油计划供应工作都搞得很顺利，这次棉布计划供应问题不大。他们忘记了计划供应的工作并不是什么简单的行政工作，它体现了党和政府的基本政策思想。党组织的任务就是要把它同人民的生活结合起来，成为行动的力量，这是严重的思想工作。有些工厂同志对思想工作有一种狭隘的看法，以为只有那些有关生产的问题才谈得上搞思想工作，其他工作都与思想工作无关，这种看法是不全面的。党的思想工作在任何情况下都应当同人民的经济政治生活相结合。实行棉布计划供应一定会引起人们日常生活的某些新变化，这是前进的向上发展的变化，但它并不可能一下子就为人们所认识和习惯。思想工作的任务就是要提高人民的国家观念，使他们正确地认识生活中的变化，自觉地拥护党和政府的措施，这样也就必然会促进人民的生产积极性和创造性。
    从这次棉布计划供应工作中可以充分地看到思想工作的严重意义，有不少党的基层组织不熟悉或是不会做思想工作。这是没有能够充分发挥思想领导作用的根本原因。有些基层党组织，把党的领导只看作是一般的号召和空洞的保证，以为宣布了纪律，从组织上采取一些措施，就不会有问题了。这种观点是片面的和有害的。它引导人们迷恋于简单化的用行政方法去作党的工作而忽视了细致深入的思想工作。
