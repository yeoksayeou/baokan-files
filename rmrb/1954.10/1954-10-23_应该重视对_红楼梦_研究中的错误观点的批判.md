    Emphasis Should Be Placed on Critiquing Erroneous Viewpoints in "Dream of the Red Chamber" Studies
    Zhong Luo
    As an enthusiast of "Dream of the Red Chamber," I have carefully read Mr. Yu Pingbo's "Dream of the Red Chamber Studies," an enlarged and revised edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination." Since then, I have successively read his other articles about "Dream of the Red Chamber," including "'Dream of the Red Chamber': A Brief Introduction" (December 19, 1953, Ta Kung Pao), "How Should We Read 'Dream of the Red Chamber'?" (January 25, 1954, Wenhui Bao), "The Ideological and Artistic Nature of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" (Northeast Literature, 1954, No. 2), "A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" (New Construction, 1954, No. 3), as well as articles published in Guangming Daily, Xinmin Evening News, and other newspapers and periodicals. Judging from all these articles, Mr. Yu Pingbo has indeed put a lot of effort into "Dream of the Red Chamber" over the past thirty years. However, I believe some of the arguments in these articles are very wrong. Recently, I saw two articles written by Li Xifan and Lan Ling, "On 'A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and Others'" and "Critique of 'Dream of the Red Chamber Studies'" in the 1954 No. 9 issue of Wen Shi Zhe and the October 10 issue of Literary Heritage No. 24 of Guangming Daily, which made a preliminary criticism of Mr. Yu Pingbo's position, viewpoints, and methods in studying "Dream of the Red Chamber." I believe this criticism is correct and necessary.
    "Dream of the Red Chamber" is one of the most widely circulated and influential literary works in China in the past three hundred years. During the Qing Dynasty, there was a saying among the literati: "If you don't talk about 'Dream of the Red Chamber', you've wasted your time reading poetry and books," which is enough to illustrate its huge influence. For a long time, the research and textual work related to "Dream of the Red Chamber" actually became a discipline, called "Redology," and a group of people who were known for their mastery of "Redology" were called "Redologists." There were quite a few "Redologists" before the "May Fourth Movement"; after the "May Fourth Movement," some self-proclaimed "New Redologists" emerged, among whom the bourgeois "New Redologists" represented by Hu Shih occupied a dominant position for more than thirty years. Even today, we can still see the continuation of Hu Shih's school of bourgeois reactionary experimentalism in Mr. Yu Pingbo's works on "Dream of the Red Chamber."
    From "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination," published in 1923, to "A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'," published in March of this year, Mr. Yu Pingbo's position, viewpoints, and methods in studying "Dream of the Red Chamber" do not seem to have changed much due to the drastic changes in China's political and economic situation and the profound changes they reflect in ideology and consciousness over the past thirty years. Mr. Yu Pingbo's basic arguments about "Dream of the Red Chamber" can be roughly summarized as follows:
    First, Mr. Yu Pingbo believes that "Dream of the Red Chamber" only writes about the real events of Cao Xueqin's own family from prosperity to decline; he believes that Cao Xueqin wrote "Dream of the Red Chamber" for no more than three reasons: one is to lament his own life experience, the second is to repent of his love affairs, and the third is to write biographies for the twelve women around him (from "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination" in 1923 to the third edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber Studies" in 1953, this is how it is said). In some articles, Mr. Yu Pingbo also mentioned that "Dream of the Red Chamber" describes the evils of feudal families, but what attitude did Cao Xueqin hold towards this feudal family? Approve or oppose? Mr. Yu Pingbo said: "The meaning of support and praise is originally very little, and the exposure and criticism are not enough. ... So there is a little bit on both sides of the answer." ("A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'") This is the so-called "resentment without anger" that Mr. Yu Pingbo greatly praises, that is, the author did not expose anything, lash out at anything, or attack anything, but only some so-called "lingering and affectionate" things. In contrast to this "style" of "resentment without anger," Mr. Yu Pingbo believes that "Water Margin," a classic masterpiece with a strong anti-feudal tendency, is "a bit excessive" and "too sharp."
    Second, in his article "A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'," Mr. Yu Pingbo also talks a lot about his views on the "traditional nature" of "Dream of the Red Chamber," but he does not start from the people's nature and realism of the work, but according to the "clich√©s of Bao and Dai's love" and fragments of certain plot or environmental descriptions, as well as some other coincidences, he "can easily see how it has accepted, integrated, and developed... the ancient tradition of novels," thus determining that the origin of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is "taking 'talented scholars and beautiful ladies' as the protagonists of the book, and is deeply influenced by The Romance of the West Chamber," "some of the boundary descriptions in the book are actually secretly transformed from The Romance of the West Chamber," "the main concept of 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' 'lust' and 'emptiness,' clearly come from Jin Ping Mei," "what he (Jia Yucun) calls 'a sliver of a thread is mistakenly escaped' is the 'a cloud of black gas rolling out' of Water Margin," "the true and false Jia Baoyu are probably associated with the true and false Wukong of Journey to the West," "such vast and unrestrained writing, and the fantastic and ever-changing chapter layout, are clearly derived from Zhuangzi," ..., and so on. This kind of formalistic far-fetchedness has nothing to do with the "traditional nature" of literature.
    Third, since it is believed that "Dream of the Red Chamber" is writing about real events, how to explain many plots that the author has not experienced? Therefore, Mr. Yu Pingbo divides the content of "Dream of the Red Chamber" into three components: "realistic," "critical," and "ideal," and "these components are intertwined with each other, but unified under the basic concept." ("A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'") What is this "basic concept"? Mr. Yu Pingbo seized a few words from the author in the first chapter and affirmed that "The Story of the Stone takes dreams as its main purpose,... originally evolves from lust and emptiness; said by the people in the dream, lust is the positive, emptiness is the negative, said by the people in the dream, emptiness is the positive, lust is the negative. ..." ("Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination," page 86) This idealistic viewpoint has not changed in Mr. Yu Pingbo's recent articles. For example, he said: "Its truth and falsehood, reality and emptiness, lightness and heaviness, concealment and obviousness, change in a myriad of ways, making it difficult for us to grasp; and if we are a little careless, we will go astray and misunderstand the opposite of the author's original intention." "What is clearly written is false; on the contrary, what is implicit and not revealed is true, the main purpose of the book." ("How Should We Read 'Dream of the Red Chamber'?", January 25, 1954, Wenhui Bao) Mr. Yu Pingbo believes that it is this secretive and mysterious concept that constitutes the basis of the entire ideological content of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and he scolds many people for "not understanding at all that what the author emphasizes as 'positive' is 'false' and 'negative' is 'true,' and they are always looking at the 'fengyue baojian' with a positive view."
    Fourth, starting from this basic concept of "lust" and "emptiness," Mr. Yu Pingbo believes that there are no affirmative or negative characters in "Dream of the Red Chamber." For example, as for Daiyu and Baochai, the author's attitude towards these two characters is very obvious, but Mr. Yu Pingbo tries to prove that the author has no preference, "two peaks face each other and two streams flow, each is extremely wonderful and cannot be compared with each other, it must be so to the extreme of the love scene, it must be so to the end of the wonderfulness of the article." ("Dream of the Red Chamber Studies," page 112) In Mr. Yu Pingbo's view, the characteristics of "Dream of the Red Chamber" lie in the "grandeur of the love scene" and the "wonderfulness of the article," while the social and historical content reflected in this great work is lightly discarded. Therefore, when coming into contact with the characters in the book, Mr. Yu Pingbo is most interested not in their social significance and character characteristics, but in whether they represent the author Cao Xueqin, saying that "under certain circumstances, they can all represent a part of the author, but no one can, and no one has ever represented his whole." "To say that they do not represent the author, even Jia Baoyu cannot represent him." In fact, the question is not whether the characters in the book represent the author, nor whether they represent the "part" or "whole" of the author, but the author's attitude towards the characters, and his love and hatred for the characters. However, Mr. Yu Pingbo just refuses to admit this question, insisting that Cao Xueqin has no preference for the characters in his works, and is "resentful but not angry" towards reality, insisting on reducing this great realistic masterpiece to a naturalistic vulgar work. In Mr. Yu Pingbo's mind, the characters in "Dream of the Red Chamber" are not vivid and typical images extracted from the real society at that time, but "sheng, dan, jing, mo, chou" pieced together in order to "perform this whole play called 'Dream of the Red Chamber'." What is the theme of this play? Of course, it is the "basic concept" of "lust and emptiness"! Mr. Yu Pingbo forcibly pulled the great realist Cao Xueqin to start from the "basic concept" of "lust and emptiness," bypassing the naturalistic path of having no preference for the characters and being "resentful but not angry" towards reality, and then came back to watch the "sheng, dan, jing, mo, chou" perform the play with the "basic concept" of "lust and emptiness"! This is precisely the expression of Hu Shih's school of bourgeois experimentalism. But what does this have to do with "Dream of the Red Chamber" and Cao Xueqin!
    Is "Dream of the Red Chamber" just a record of the real events of the author Cao Xueqin and his family? Regardless of whether the beginning of the whole book, "The author himself said that he had experienced a dream..." and so on, is a disclaimer by the author, judging from the effect of "Dream of the Red Chamber" among the people, and from the realistic spirit of the work itself, "Dream of the Red Chamber" reflects the corruption and ugliness of the feudal ruling class in the eighteenth century. In this huge picture, we see the exploitation, bullying, hypocrisy, treachery, licentiousness, shamelessness, and depravity of the spiritual life of the feudal class. Although Cao Xueqin still maintained a certain degree of nostalgia and pity for the decline of the class to which he belonged, and therefore shed tears when whipping the characters he hated; his realistic creative methods and high artistic skills convincingly illustrate the inevitability of the collapse and death of a feudal aristocratic family, and also foreshadow the collapse and death of the entire feudal system. However, Mr. Yu Pingbo isolated the Jia family from the entire social and economic situation and background of the mid-Qing Dynasty to see its decline, to see the love tragedy of Baoyu and Daiyu and the life phenomena of various characters; he drew out the rich social content of this work, thus obliterating the high ideological nature and typicality of the artistic image, believing that "the characters and events in the book all have prototypes, so the greatest means of the author of Dream of the Red Chamber is sketching. ... Fiction and realism both rely on experience, but the arrangement of the context in the middle is a little different." ("Dream of the Red Chamber Studies," page 116)
    This naturalistic view is in the same vein as Hu Shih's view. As early as two years before the publication of "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination," Hu Shih said that "the true value of Dream of the Red Chamber lies in this plain and unremarkable naturalism" (Asia East Edition of Dream of the Red Chamber, Volume 1, page 52). Hu Shih's touted experimentalist textual research method of "only recognizing facts and only following evidence" is consistent with his reactionary thought of "talking less about doctrines and more about problems" in politics. Just as in politics he tried to lure the people away from class struggle, in the study of classical literature such as Dream of the Red Chamber, Hu Shih tried to deny the social and political significance of Dream of the Red Chamber, and as a result, he fundamentally depreciated the historical and literary value of this great realistic masterpiece. Mr. Yu Pingbo's "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination" repeatedly mentioned how "Mr. Hu Shih" was, citing it as being of the same mind. By 1952, when "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination" was renamed "Dream of the Red Chamber Studies" and published, except for the replacement of a small number of articles and the deletion of the date noted at the end of each article, most of it was not changed. Sometimes, even only the words "Mr. Hu Shih" and so on were deleted in the text, while Hu Shih's viewpoint was entirely retained as Mr. Yu Pingbo's own viewpoint.
    Mr. Yu Pingbo's method of studying Dream of the Red Chamber is also an idealistic and subjective method. He once openly declared:
      "For literature and art, in addition to appreciation, it is okay to do some research; but this research should not be called historical or scientific, but only a study of taste. ... It is only a temporary amusement to attach a little research when appreciating literature and art. If you take a scalpel to cut it up, I am afraid that you will gain nothing after cutting it up. This is not to blame your poor surgery, or your precious knife is not fast enough, but it is just 'why use a bull's knife to kill a chicken'. ... This kind of (tasteful) research, its object and method are not fixed. If you interpret research as fixed knowledge, then it may not become research at all, that is to say, it is okay to play around there." ("Revision of Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination," March 7, 1925, "Modern Review")
    Judging from Mr. Yu Pingbo's practice of studying "Dream of the Red Chamber" for the past thirty years, he has been spending a lot of effort on this "tasteful research" based on his personal preferences. Some of his research results have been useful in sorting out materials and distinguishing between true and false. However, our affirmation of this part of the function does not mean that we agree with or tolerate Mr. Yu Pingbo's bourgeois position, viewpoints, and methods in studying "Dream of the Red Chamber." He denies the realistic spirit of "Dream of the Red Chamber" and denies the typical characters of "Dream of the Red Chamber" in the typical environment. This kind of position and viewpoint, as well as the subjective and cumbersome research methods, will inevitably lead readers astray, guiding them to divide the unified and organic life in "Dream of the Red Chamber" into one-sided and isolated phenomena, thus getting to the bottom of things, verifying the seating arrangement of the "Shou Yihong Qunfang Night Banquet," pursuing the ambiguous relationship between Qin Keqing and Jia Baoyu, and studying "why Jia Baoyu only eats porridge," and so on. This kind of research that abandons the fundamentals and pursues the trivial, "it is a pity that it is useless to waste energy," Mr. Yu Pingbo himself is "playing around," which is naturally "okay," but it is of no benefit to the vast number of readers, especially young readers, who urgently need to draw nourishment from classical literary works.
    However, the ideological and cognitive level and discernment of readers are constantly improving, and progressive young people can no longer tolerate the bourgeois position, viewpoints, and methods arbitrarily damaging and distorting our great national excellent literary heritage. The two articles written by Li Xifan and Lan Ling refuted Mr. Yu Pingbo's distortion of "Dream of the Red Chamber."
    Starting from the viewpoint of historical materialism, the two articles written by Li Xifan and Lan Ling pointed out that "'Dream of the Red Chamber' appeared in the Qianlong prosperous age of the Qing Empire, which was not an accidental phenomenon. The Qianlong era was the prelude to the impending decline of the Qing Dynasty. In this huge change, the inevitable fate of the feudal bureaucratic landlord class was doomed." "The decline of the Jia family ... is a sign that the entire feudal bureaucratic landlord class is inevitably heading for collapse under the gradually forming new historical conditions. There may be many reasons for the decline of the Jia family, but the most fundamental one is the social and economic reasons." If this viewpoint is compared with the viewpoints of Hu Shih and others, it is not difficult to see what position the "authority of textual research" of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is standing on. Hu Shih said in "Textual Research on Dream of the Red Chamber" that "Dream of the Red Chamber" is Cao Xueqin's "description of the situation of his family from being rich to becoming poor. We see the history of Cao Yin's life, which is definitely not like a corrupt official; the reason why his family later declined, and his son went bankrupt due to losses, is probably because his family all loved to squander money and put on a show; they paid attention to eating and drinking, paid attention to the scene; collected exquisite books, carved exquisite books; associated with literati and famous scholars, associated with noble officials, entertained the emperor, up to four or five times; they also did not know how to manage money, and were unwilling to save money; they were used to squandering money, and they could not shrink back, resulting in losses, resulting in bankruptcy and confiscation of the family." Isn't this a vivid sigh of grief for one's own kind?
    The articles by Li Xifan and Lan Ling focused on criticizing Mr. Yu Pingbo's idealistic and subjective viewpoints in his work on studying "Dream of the Red Chamber." They pointed out that Mr. Yu Pingbo, because he did not explore the clear anti-feudal tendency of "Dream of the Red Chamber" from the principle of realism, but started from the abstract artistic viewpoint and was confused by the so-called "style of resentment without anger," "in essence, he was trying to reduce the realistic significance of "Dream of the Red Chamber" against feudalism." They also criticized Mr. Yu Pingbo's fallacy of confirming that "the main concept of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is lust and emptiness," and pointed out that "Dream of the Red Chamber" is by no means a concretization of the "concept of lust and emptiness," but a tragedy of living and realistic life. "The education that people get through the tragic fate of the protagonists under the author's pen is not to fall into the abyss of determinism, but to arouse deep hatred for the feudal rulers and their entire system, and warm sympathy for the affirmative characters Baoyu and Daiyu."
    Secondly, these two articles criticized Mr. Yu Pingbo's formalistic assertion when discussing the traditional nature of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and believed that the traditional nature of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is manifested in the inheritance and promotion of the people's nature of classical literary works; the creation and enthusiastic praise of positive models; and the loyalty to realistic creative methods, and is by no means as Mr. Yu Pingbo analyzed and quoted, only piecing together, copying previous texts, and saying what is "traditional nature."
    These two articles also pointed out that Mr. Yu Pingbo's literary criticism principle is anti-realism. He tried to deny that "Dream of the Red Chamber" is a great realistic tragedy, thus distorting "Dream of the Red Chamber" into a naturalistic work of sketching.
    Although these two articles may have some small shortcomings, these small shortcomings do not detract from the overall tendency and fighting spirit of these two articles. It should be said that these two articles are the first shot in the past thirty years to counter the bourgeois position, viewpoints, and methods of Hu Shih's school of "New Redologists" in the work of classical literature research, a valuable first shot!
    The reason why this shot is valuable is that our literary and art circles have turned a blind eye to the dangerous fact that the bourgeois position, viewpoints, and methods of Hu Shih's school of "New Redologists" still occupy a dominant position in the work of classical literature research after the liberation of the whole country. It seems that these two articles did not attract due attention in the literary and art circles before and after their publication. Yes, we have called for learning all the excellent national literary and artistic heritage, and the national publishing house has also sorted out and published "Dream of the Red Chamber" and some other classical literary masterpieces. This is necessary, but it cannot be regarded as having accepted and carried forward the literary heritage. Only by studying classical literary works with the Marxist position, viewpoints, and methods, and truly achieving the goal of taking its democratic essence and discarding its feudal dross, can these heritages become a valuable part of the art wealth of the whole people and a necessary foundation for the development of socialist realist literature and art. However, our research work on the excellent literary heritage‚Äîsuch as "Dream of the Red Chamber"‚Äîhas not yet been detached from the influence of bourgeois idealism, subjectivism, and anti-realism. If this continues to develop, it will be impossible for the people to understand the true history from classical literary works, it will be impossible for the people to understand the political significance of literary works as tools of social struggle, and it will be impossible to truly understand the value of excellent classical literary works, thereby loving our nation's precious literary heritage.
    Now, the question has been raised to people's faces, and this question should be discussed. In terms of its ideological essence, this question is another serious struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie on the ideological front. The purpose of this struggle should be to distinguish between right and wrong, and to eliminate the bourgeois idealistic and subjective position, viewpoints, and methods in the field of classical literature research; and to correctly learn and use the Marxist materialistic and scientific position, viewpoints, and methods. Every literary and art worker, regardless of whether he or she is specifically engaged in the work of classical literature research, must attach importance to this ideological struggle. This is not a question of any individual person. Any more or less useful contribution to the work of research and textual research should be respected. However, we should resolutely oppose all bourgeois positions, viewpoints, and methods, regardless of what name they appear under.
