    Emphasis Should Be Placed on Critiquing Erroneous Viewpoints in "Dream of the Red Chamber" Studies
    Zhong Luo
    As an enthusiast of "Dream of the Red Chamber," I have carefully read Mr. Yu Pingbo's "Dream of the Red Chamber Studies," an enlarged and revised edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination." Since then, I have successively read his other articles about "Dream of the Red Chamber," including "'Dream of the Red Chamber': A Brief Introduction" (December 19, 1953, Ta Kung Pao), "How Should We Read 'Dream of the Red Chamber'?" (January 25, 1954, Wenhui Bao), "The Ideological and Artistic Nature of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" (Northeast Literature, 1954, No. 2), "A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" (New Construction, 1954, No. 3), as well as articles published in Guangming Daily, Xinmin Evening News, and other newspapers and periodicals. Judging from all these articles, Mr. Yu Pingbo has indeed put a lot of effort into "Dream of the Red Chamber" over the past thirty years. However, I believe some of the arguments in these articles are very wrong. Recently, I saw two articles written by Li Xifan and Lan Ling, "On 'A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and Others'" and "Critique of 'Dream of the Red Chamber Studies'" in the 1954 No. 9 issue of Wen Shi Zhe and the October 10 issue of Literary Heritage No. 24 of Guangming Daily, which made a preliminary criticism of Mr. Yu Pingbo's position, viewpoints, and methods in studying "Dream of the Red Chamber." I believe this criticism is correct and necessary.
    "Dream of the Red Chamber" is one of the most widely circulated and influential literary works in China in the past three hundred years. During the Qing Dynasty, there was a saying among the literati: "If you don't talk about 'Dream of the Red Chamber', you've wasted your time reading poetry and books," which is enough to illustrate its huge influence. For a long time, the research and textual work related to "Dream of the Red Chamber" actually became a discipline, called "Redology," and a group of people who were known for their mastery of "Redology" were called "Redologists." There were quite a few "Redologists" before the "May Fourth Movement"; after the "May Fourth Movement," some self-proclaimed "New Redologists" emerged, among whom the bourgeois "New Redologists" represented by Hu Shih occupied a dominant position for more than thirty years. Even today, we can still see the continuation of Hu Shih's school of bourgeois reactionary experimentalism in Mr. Yu Pingbo's works on "Dream of the Red Chamber."
    From "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination," published in 1923, to "A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'," published in March of this year, Mr. Yu Pingbo's position, viewpoints, and methods in studying "Dream of the Red Chamber" do not seem to have changed much due to the drastic changes in China's political and economic situation and the profound changes they reflect in ideology and consciousness over the past thirty years. Mr. Yu Pingbo's basic arguments about "Dream of the Red Chamber" can be roughly summarized as follows:
    First, Mr. Yu Pingbo believes that "Dream of the Red Chamber" only writes about the real events of Cao Xueqin's own family from prosperity to decline; he believes that Cao Xueqin wrote "Dream of the Red Chamber" for no more than three reasons: one is to lament his own life experience, the second is to repent of his love affairs, and the third is to write biographies for the twelve women around him (from "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination" in 1923 to the third edition of "Dream of the Red Chamber Studies" in 1953, this is how it is said). In some articles, Mr. Yu Pingbo also mentioned that "Dream of the Red Chamber" describes the evils of feudal families, but what attitude did Cao Xueqin hold towards this feudal family? Approve or oppose? Mr. Yu Pingbo said: "The meaning of support and praise is originally very little, and the exposure and criticism are not enough. ... So there is a little bit on both sides of the answer." ("A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'") This is the so-called "resentment without anger" that Mr. Yu Pingbo greatly praises, that is, the author did not expose anything, lash out at anything, or attack anything, but only some so-called "lingering and affectionate" things. In contrast to this "style" of "resentment without anger," Mr. Yu Pingbo believes that "Water Margin," a classic masterpiece with a strong anti-feudal tendency, is "a bit excessive" and "too sharp."
    Second, in his article "A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'," Mr. Yu Pingbo also talks a lot about his views on the "traditional nature" of "Dream of the Red Chamber," but he does not start from the people's nature and realism of the work, but according to the "clichés of Bao and Dai's love" and fragments of certain plot or environmental descriptions, as well as some other coincidences, he "can easily see how it has accepted, integrated, and developed... the ancient tradition of novels," thus determining that the origin of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is "taking 'talented scholars and beautiful ladies' as the protagonists of the book, and is deeply influenced by The Romance of the West Chamber," "some of the boundary descriptions in the book are actually secretly transformed from The Romance of the West Chamber," "the main concept of 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' 'lust' and 'emptiness,' clearly come from Jin Ping Mei," "what he (Jia Yucun) calls 'a sliver of a thread is mistakenly escaped' is the 'a cloud of black gas rolling out' of Water Margin," "the true and false Jia Baoyu are probably associated with the true and false Wukong of Journey to the West," "such vast and unrestrained writing, and the fantastic and ever-changing chapter layout, are clearly derived from Zhuangzi," ..., and so on. This kind of formalistic far-fetchedness has nothing to do with the "traditional nature" of literature.
    Third, since it is believed that "Dream of the Red Chamber" is writing about real events, how to explain many plots that the author has not experienced? Therefore, Mr. Yu Pingbo divides the content of "Dream of the Red Chamber" into three components: "realistic," "critical," and "ideal," and "these components are intertwined with each other, but unified under the basic concept." ("A Brief Discussion of 'Dream of the Red Chamber'") What is this "basic concept"? Mr. Yu Pingbo seized a few words from the author in the first chapter and affirmed that "The Story of the Stone takes dreams as its main purpose,... originally evolves from lust and emptiness; said by the people in the dream, lust is the positive, emptiness is the negative, said by the people in the dream, emptiness is the positive, lust is the negative. ..." ("Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination," page 86) This idealistic viewpoint has not changed in Mr. Yu Pingbo's recent articles. For example, he said: "Its truth and falsehood, reality and emptiness, lightness and heaviness, concealment and obviousness, change in a myriad of ways, making it difficult for us to grasp; and if we are a little careless, we will go astray and misunderstand the opposite of the author's original intention." "What is clearly written is false; on the contrary, what is implicit and not revealed is true, the main purpose of the book." ("How Should We Read 'Dream of the Red Chamber'?", January 25, 1954, Wenhui Bao) Mr. Yu Pingbo believes that it is this secretive and mysterious concept that constitutes the basis of the entire ideological content of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and he scolds many people for "not understanding at all that what the author emphasizes as 'positive' is 'false' and 'negative' is 'true,' and they are always looking at the 'fengyue baojian' with a positive view."
    Fourth, starting from this basic concept of "lust" and "emptiness," Mr. Yu Pingbo believes that there are no affirmative or negative characters in "Dream of the Red Chamber." For example, as for Daiyu and Baochai, the author's attitude towards these two characters is very obvious, but Mr. Yu Pingbo tries to prove that the author has no preference, "two peaks face each other and two streams flow, each is extremely wonderful and cannot be compared with each other, it must be so to the extreme of the love scene, it must be so to the end of the wonderfulness of the article." ("Dream of the Red Chamber Studies," page 112) In Mr. Yu Pingbo's view, the characteristics of "Dream of the Red Chamber" lie in the "grandeur of the love scene" and the "wonderfulness of the article," while the social and historical content reflected in this great work is lightly discarded. Therefore, when coming into contact with the characters in the book, Mr. Yu Pingbo is most interested not in their social significance and character characteristics, but in whether they represent the author Cao Xueqin, saying that "under certain circumstances, they can all represent a part of the author, but no one can, and no one has ever represented his whole." "To say that they do not represent the author, even Jia Baoyu cannot represent him." In fact, the question is not whether the characters in the book represent the author, nor whether they represent the "part" or "whole" of the author, but the author's attitude towards the characters, and his love and hatred for the characters. However, Mr. Yu Pingbo just refuses to admit this question, insisting that Cao Xueqin has no preference for the characters in his works, and is "resentful but not angry" towards reality, insisting on reducing this great realistic masterpiece to a naturalistic vulgar work. In Mr. Yu Pingbo's mind, the characters in "Dream of the Red Chamber" are not vivid and typical images extracted from the real society at that time, but "sheng, dan, jing, mo, chou" pieced together in order to "perform this whole play called 'Dream of the Red Chamber'." What is the theme of this play? Of course, it is the "basic concept" of "lust and emptiness"! Mr. Yu Pingbo forcibly pulled the great realist Cao Xueqin to start from the "basic concept" of "lust and emptiness," bypassing the naturalistic path of having no preference for the characters and being "resentful but not angry" towards reality, and then came back to watch the "sheng, dan, jing, mo, chou" perform the play with the "basic concept" of "lust and emptiness"! This is precisely the expression of Hu Shih's school of bourgeois experimentalism. But what does this have to do with "Dream of the Red Chamber" and Cao Xueqin!
    Is "Dream of the Red Chamber" just a record of the real events of the author Cao Xueqin and his family? Regardless of whether the beginning of the whole book, "The author himself said that he had experienced a dream..." and so on, is a disclaimer by the author, judging from the effect of "Dream of the Red Chamber" among the people, and from the realistic spirit of the work itself, "Dream of the Red Chamber" reflects the corruption and ugliness of the feudal ruling class in the eighteenth century. In this huge picture, we see the exploitation, bullying, hypocrisy, treachery, licentiousness, shamelessness, and depravity of the spiritual life of the feudal class. Although Cao Xueqin still maintained a certain degree of nostalgia and pity for the decline of the class to which he belonged, and therefore shed tears when whipping the characters he hated; his realistic creative methods and high artistic skills convincingly illustrate the inevitability of the collapse and death of a feudal aristocratic family, and also foreshadow the collapse and death of the entire feudal system. However, Mr. Yu Pingbo isolated the Jia family from the entire social and economic situation and background of the mid-Qing Dynasty to see its decline, to see the love tragedy of Baoyu and Daiyu and the life phenomena of various characters; he drew out the rich social content of this work, thus obliterating the high ideological nature and typicality of the artistic image, believing that "the characters and events in the book all have prototypes, so the greatest means of the author of Dream of the Red Chamber is sketching. ... Fiction and realism both rely on experience, but the arrangement of the context in the middle is a little different." ("Dream of the Red Chamber Studies," page 116)
    This naturalistic view is in the same vein as Hu Shih's view. As early as two years before the publication of "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination," Hu Shih said that "the true value of Dream of the Red Chamber lies in this plain and unremarkable naturalism" (Asia East Edition of Dream of the Red Chamber, Volume 1, page 52). Hu Shih's touted experimentalist textual research method of "only recognizing facts and only following evidence" is consistent with his reactionary thought of "talking less about doctrines and more about problems" in politics. Just as in politics he tried to lure the people away from class struggle, in the study of classical literature such as Dream of the Red Chamber, Hu Shih tried to deny the social and political significance of Dream of the Red Chamber, and as a result, he fundamentally depreciated the historical and literary value of this great realistic masterpiece. Mr. Yu Pingbo's "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination" repeatedly mentioned how "Mr. Hu Shih" was, citing it as being of the same mind. By 1952, when "Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination" was renamed "Dream of the Red Chamber Studies" and published, except for the replacement of a small number of articles and the deletion of the date noted at the end of each article, most of it was not changed. Sometimes, even only the words "Mr. Hu Shih" and so on were deleted in the text, while Hu Shih's viewpoint was entirely retained as Mr. Yu Pingbo's own viewpoint.
    Mr. Yu Pingbo's method of studying Dream of the Red Chamber is also an idealistic and subjective method. He once openly declared:
      "For literature and art, in addition to appreciation, it is okay to do some research; but this research should not be called historical or scientific, but only a study of taste. ... It is only a temporary amusement to attach a little research when appreciating literature and art. If you take a scalpel to cut it up, I am afraid that you will gain nothing after cutting it up. This is not to blame your poor surgery, or your precious knife is not fast enough, but it is just 'why use a bull's knife to kill a chicken'. ... This kind of (tasteful) research, its object and method are not fixed. If you interpret research as fixed knowledge, then it may not become research at all, that is to say, it is okay to play around there." ("Revision of Dream of the Red Chamber Discrimination," March 7, 1925, "Modern Review")
    Judging from Mr. Yu Pingbo's practice of studying "Dream of the Red Chamber" for the past thirty years, he has been spending a lot of effort on this "tasteful research" based on his personal preferences. Some of his research results have been useful in sorting out materials and distinguishing between true and false. However, our affirmation of this part of the function does not mean that we agree with or tolerate Mr. Yu Pingbo's bourgeois position, viewpoints, and methods in studying "Dream of the Red Chamber." He denies the realistic spirit of "Dream of the Red Chamber" and denies the typical characters of "Dream of the Red Chamber" in the typical environment. This kind of position and viewpoint, as well as the subjective and cumbersome research methods, will inevitably lead readers astray, guiding them to divide the unified and organic life in "Dream of the Red Chamber" into one-sided and isolated phenomena, thus getting to the bottom of things, verifying the seating arrangement of the "Shou Yihong Qunfang Night Banquet," pursuing the ambiguous relationship between Qin Keqing and Jia Baoyu, and studying "why Jia Baoyu only eats porridge," and so on. This kind of research that abandons the fundamentals and pursues the trivial, "it is a pity that it is useless to waste energy," Mr. Yu Pingbo himself is "playing around," which is naturally "okay," but it is of no benefit to the vast number of readers, especially young readers, who urgently need to draw nourishment from classical literary works.
    However, the ideological and cognitive level and discernment of readers are constantly improving, and progressive young people can no longer tolerate the bourgeois position, viewpoints, and methods arbitrarily damaging and distorting our great national excellent literary heritage. The two articles written by Li Xifan and Lan Ling refuted Mr. Yu Pingbo's distortion of "Dream of the Red Chamber."
    Starting from the viewpoint of historical materialism, the two articles written by Li Xifan and Lan Ling pointed out that "'Dream of the Red Chamber' appeared in the Qianlong prosperous age of the Qing Empire, which was not an accidental phenomenon. The Qianlong era was the prelude to the impending decline of the Qing Dynasty. In this huge change, the inevitable fate of the feudal bureaucratic landlord class was doomed." "The decline of the Jia family ... is a sign that the entire feudal bureaucratic landlord class is inevitably heading for collapse under the gradually forming new historical conditions. There may be many reasons for the decline of the Jia family, but the most fundamental one is the social and economic reasons." If this viewpoint is compared with the viewpoints of Hu Shih and others, it is not difficult to see what position the "authority of textual research" of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is standing on. Hu Shih said in "Textual Research on Dream of the Red Chamber" that "Dream of the Red Chamber" is Cao Xueqin's "description of the situation of his family from being rich to becoming poor. We see the history of Cao Yin's life, which is definitely not like a corrupt official; the reason why his family later declined, and his son went bankrupt due to losses, is probably because his family all loved to squander money and put on a show; they paid attention to eating and drinking, paid attention to the scene; collected exquisite books, carved exquisite books; associated with literati and famous scholars, associated with noble officials, entertained the emperor, up to four or five times; they also did not know how to manage money, and were unwilling to save money; they were used to squandering money, and they could not shrink back, resulting in losses, resulting in bankruptcy and confiscation of the family." Isn't this a vivid sigh of grief for one's own kind?
    The articles by Li Xifan and Lan Ling focused on criticizing Mr. Yu Pingbo's idealistic and subjective viewpoints in his work on studying "Dream of the Red Chamber." They pointed out that Mr. Yu Pingbo, because he did not explore the clear anti-feudal tendency of "Dream of the Red Chamber" from the principle of realism, but started from the abstract artistic viewpoint and was confused by the so-called "style of resentment without anger," "in essence, he was trying to reduce the realistic significance of "Dream of the Red Chamber" against feudalism." They also criticized Mr. Yu Pingbo's fallacy of confirming that "the main concept of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is lust and emptiness," and pointed out that "Dream of the Red Chamber" is by no means a concretization of the "concept of lust and emptiness," but a tragedy of living and realistic life. "The education that people get through the tragic fate of the protagonists under the author's pen is not to fall into the abyss of determinism, but to arouse deep hatred for the feudal rulers and their entire system, and warm sympathy for the affirmative characters Baoyu and Daiyu."
    Secondly, these two articles criticized Mr. Yu Pingbo's formalistic assertion when discussing the traditional nature of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and believed that the traditional nature of "Dream of the Red Chamber" is manifested in the inheritance and promotion of the people's nature of classical literary works; the creation and enthusiastic praise of positive models; and the loyalty to realistic creative methods, and is by no means as Mr. Yu Pingbo analyzed and quoted, only piecing together, copying previous texts, and saying what is "traditional nature."
    These two articles also pointed out that Mr. Yu Pingbo's literary criticism principle is anti-realism. He tried to deny that "Dream of the Red Chamber" is a great realistic tragedy, thus distorting "Dream of the Red Chamber" into a naturalistic work of sketching.
    Although these two articles may have some small shortcomings, these small shortcomings do not detract from the overall tendency and fighting spirit of these two articles. It should be said that these two articles are the first shot in the past thirty years to counter the bourgeois position, viewpoints, and methods of Hu Shih's school of "New Redologists" in the work of classical literature research, a valuable first shot!
    The reason why this shot is valuable is that our literary and art circles have turned a blind eye to the dangerous fact that the bourgeois position, viewpoints, and methods of Hu Shih's school of "New Redologists" still occupy a dominant position in the work of classical literature research after the liberation of the whole country. It seems that these two articles did not attract due attention in the literary and art circles before and after their publication. Yes, we have called for learning all the excellent national literary and artistic heritage, and the national publishing house has also sorted out and published "Dream of the Red Chamber" and some other classical literary masterpieces. This is necessary, but it cannot be regarded as having accepted and carried forward the literary heritage. Only by studying classical literary works with the Marxist position, viewpoints, and methods, and truly achieving the goal of taking its democratic essence and discarding its feudal dross, can these heritages become a valuable part of the art wealth of the whole people and a necessary foundation for the development of socialist realist literature and art. However, our research work on the excellent literary heritage—such as "Dream of the Red Chamber"—has not yet been detached from the influence of bourgeois idealism, subjectivism, and anti-realism. If this continues to develop, it will be impossible for the people to understand the true history from classical literary works, it will be impossible for the people to understand the political significance of literary works as tools of social struggle, and it will be impossible to truly understand the value of excellent classical literary works, thereby loving our nation's precious literary heritage.
    Now, the question has been raised to people's faces, and this question should be discussed. In terms of its ideological essence, this question is another serious struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie on the ideological front. The purpose of this struggle should be to distinguish between right and wrong, and to eliminate the bourgeois idealistic and subjective position, viewpoints, and methods in the field of classical literature research; and to correctly learn and use the Marxist materialistic and scientific position, viewpoints, and methods. Every literary and art worker, regardless of whether he or she is specifically engaged in the work of classical literature research, must attach importance to this ideological struggle. This is not a question of any individual person. Any more or less useful contribution to the work of research and textual research should be respected. However, we should resolutely oppose all bourgeois positions, viewpoints, and methods, regardless of what name they appear under.

    应该重视对“红楼梦”研究中的错误观点的批判
    钟洛
    作为红楼梦的一个爱好者，我曾认真地读了俞平伯先生的由“红楼梦辨”增订重版的“红楼梦研究”；此后，陆续地读了他的关于红楼梦的其他文章，其中包括“‘红楼梦’简说”（一九五三年十二月十九日大公报）、“我们怎样读‘红楼梦’？”（一九五四年一月二十五日文汇报）、“红楼梦的思想性与艺术性”（东北文学一九五四年第二期）、“红楼梦简论”（新建设一九五四年第三期）以及在光明日报、新民报等报刊上发表的文章。从所有这些文章看，俞平伯先生三十年来对红楼梦确实下了不少工夫。但是，其中有些文章的论点，我认为是很错误的。最近，在文史哲一九五四年第九期和十月十日光明日报的文学遗产第二十四期上看到李希凡、蓝翎两位写的“关于‘红楼梦简论’及其他”和“评‘红楼梦研究’”两文，对俞平伯先生研究红楼梦的立场、观点、方法作了初步的批判。这个批判，我认为是正确的，也是必要的。
    红楼梦是中国近三百年来流传最广、影响最大的文学著作之一。满清时代的文人们有所谓
  “开谈不讲红楼梦，纵读诗书也枉然”的口头语，这就足以说明它的影响是多么巨大了。在长久的时期中，有关红楼梦的研究和考证的工作，居然成为一门学问，被叫做“红学”，有一班因长于“红学”而知名的人，被称为“红学家”。“五四”以前的
  “红学家”们就很不少；“五四”以后又出现了一些自命为“新红学家”的，其中以胡适之为代表的一派资产阶级的“新红学家”占据了支配地位，达三十余年。直到今天，我们仍然可以从俞平伯先生关于红楼梦的论著中看到胡适之派的资产阶级反动的实验主义对待古典文学作品的观点和方法的继续。
    从一九二三年出版的“红楼梦辨”起，到今年三月发表的“红楼梦简论”为止，俞平伯先生研究红楼梦的立场、观点和方法，似乎并未因三十年来中国政治经济的急剧变化和它反映在思想意识上的深刻变化而有多大改变。俞平伯先生对红楼梦的基本论点大致可以归纳如下：
    一、俞平伯先生认为红楼梦只是写曹雪芹自己的家庭由兴盛到衰败的实事；认为曹雪芹之所以写红楼梦，不外三个原因：一是感叹自己的身世，二是情场忏悔，三是为他周围的十二个女子作本传（从一九二三年的“红楼梦辨”到一九五三年“红楼梦研究”第三版，都是这样说的）。在一部分文章里，俞平伯先生也提到红楼梦是描写封建大家庭的罪恶，但曹雪芹对这个封建大家庭到底抱着什么态度呢？赞成还是反对？俞平伯先生说：“拥护赞美的意思原很少，暴露批判又觉不够。……所以对这答案的正反两面可以说都有一点。”（“红楼梦简论”）这就是俞平伯先生所大大赞赏的所谓“怨而不怒”，就是说作者并没有暴露什么，鞭挞什么，打击什么，有的只是一种所谓“缠绵悱恻”的东西。在这种“怨而不怒”的“风格”的对比之下，俞平伯先生认为具有强烈的反封建倾向性的古典名著“水浒”就“有些过火”和“锋芒毕露”了。
    二、俞平伯先生在他的“红楼梦简论”一文中还大讲他对“红楼梦”的传统性的看法，但他不是从作品里的人民性和现实主义精神出发，而是根据
  “宝黛言情的口头语”和某些情节或环境描写的片断以及其他一些巧合，就“很容易看出它如何接受了、综合了、发展了……古代的小说传统”，从而断定红楼梦的渊源是“以‘才子佳人’做书中的主角，受西厢记的影响很深”，“书中有些境界描写，实暗从西厢脱胎换骨的”，“红楼梦的主要观念‘色’
  ‘空’明从金瓶梅来”，“其（贾雨村）所谓‘一丝半缕误而逸出’者，即水浒的‘一道黑气滚将出来’也”，“真假宝玉恐怕也从西游记的真假悟空联想得来的”，“像这样汪洋恣肆的笔墨，奇幻变换的章法，从庄子脱胎，非常显明”，……，等等。这种形式主义的牵强附会，实际上和文学的“传统性”毫不相干。
    三、既然认为红楼梦是写实事，又如何解释许多作者未曾经历过的情节呢？于是俞平伯先生就把红楼梦的内容分作“现实的”、“批判的”、“理想的”三种成分，而“这些成分每互相纠缠着，却在基本的观念下统一起来的。”（“红楼梦简论”）这个“基本的观念”是什么？俞平伯先生抓住第一回内作者的几句话，便肯定“石头记以梦幻为本旨，……本演色空；由梦中人说，色是正，空是反，由梦中人说，空是正，色是反。……”（“红楼梦辨”第八十六页）这种唯心的观点，在俞平伯先生近年来的一些文章中仍然没有改变。例如说：“它的真假虚实，轻重隐显，变化百端，使我们不容易抓住；而且稍一疏忽，就会走入迷途，误解到作者原意的反面去。”“明显地写出来的是假的；相反的，含而不露的才是真的，书的本旨。”（“我们怎样读‘红楼梦’？”，一九五四年一月二十五日文汇报）俞平伯先生认为正是这种诡秘玄虚的观念构成红楼梦全部思想内容的基础，他并斥许多人“对作者强调的‘正’为‘假’，‘反’为‘真’完全不了解，始终是在正照‘风月宝鉴’”。
    四、从这个“色”“空”的基本观念出发，俞平伯先生认为红楼梦里就无所谓肯定的或否定的人物。例如黛玉和宝钗吧，作者对于这两个人物的态度是非常明显的，但俞平伯先生却力图证明作者并无所偏爱，“两峰对峙双水分流，各极其妙莫能相下，必如此方极情场之盛，必如此方尽文章之妙。”
  （“红楼梦研究”第一一二页）在俞平伯先生看来，红楼梦的特色就在于“情场之盛”和“文章之妙”，而这一伟大作品所反映的社会历史内容，却被轻轻丢开了。所以在接触到书中的人物时，俞平伯先生最感兴趣的不是他们的社会意义和性格特征，而是他们是否代表作者曹雪芹的问题，说“在某种情况下都可以代表作者的一部分，却谁也不能，谁也不曾代表他的全体。”“要说不代表作者，即贾宝玉也不能代表他。”其实，问题不在于书中人物是否代表作者，也不在于代表作者的“一部分”或“全体”，而在于作者对人物的态度，对人物的爱憎。而俞平伯先生却偏偏不承认这个问题，硬说曹雪芹对自己作品中的人物无所偏爱，对现实“怨而不怒”，硬要把这部伟大的现实主义杰作降低为自然主义的庸俗作品。在俞平伯先生的心目中，红楼梦中的人物不是从当时现实社会中提炼出来的活生生的典型形象，而是为了“表演这整出的戏叫‘红楼梦’”，而拼凑起来的“生旦净末丑”。这出戏的主题是什么呢？当然是“色、空”的“基本观念”！俞平伯先生硬拉着伟大的现实主义者曹雪芹从“色、空”的“基本观念”出发，绕过对人物无所偏爱、对现实“怨而不怒”的自然主义的道路，又回来看“生旦净末丑”表演有“色、空”“基本观念”的戏！这正是胡适之派的资产阶级实验主义思想的表现。然而这同红楼梦和曹雪芹何干！
    红楼梦只是记载了作者曹雪芹和他的一家的实事吗？姑不论全书的开端“作者自云曾历过一番梦幻之后……”等等是否为作者的托词，从红楼梦在人民群众中产生的效果来看，从作品本身的现实主义精神来看，红楼梦反映了十八世纪封建统治阶层的腐朽和丑恶，在这幅巨大的图卷里，我们看见封建阶级的剥削、欺凌、虚伪、奸诈、荒淫无耻和精神生活的糜烂。尽管曹雪芹对他自己所属阶级的衰败，还保持一定程度的眷恋和怜悯，因而在鞭挞他所憎恨的人物的时候，还噙着眼泪；但是他的现实主义的创作方法和高度的艺术手腕，却使人信服地说明一个封建贵族大家庭崩溃和死亡的必然性，也预告了整个封建制度的崩溃和死亡。而俞平伯先生却把贾家从满清中叶整个社会经济状况和时代背景孤立开来去看它的衰败，去看宝玉和黛玉的恋爱悲剧和各种人物的生活现象；抽掉这部作品的丰富的社会内容，因而抹杀了作品的高度思想性和艺术形象的典型性，认为“书中底人物事情都有蓝本，所以红楼梦作者底最大手段是写生。……虚构和写实都靠着经验，不过中间的那些上下文底排列，有些不同罢了。”（“红楼梦研究”第一一六页）
      这种自然主义的观点，是和胡适之的观点一脉相传的。胡适之在“红楼梦辨”出版的更早两年，就说“红楼梦的真正价值正在这平淡无奇的自然主义上面”（亚东版红楼梦第一册第五十二页），胡适之所标榜的“只认识事实，只跟着证据走”的实验主义考据方法，是和他在政治上的“少谈些主义，多谈些问题”的反动思想相一致的。正如在政治上企图诱骗人民离开阶级斗争一样，在对待古典文学如红楼梦的研究上，胡适之力图否认红楼梦的社会政治意义，结果就从根本上贬低了这部伟大的现实主义巨著的历史的和文学的价值。俞平伯先生的
  “红楼梦辨”，数次提到“胡适之先生”如何如何，引为同调。到一九五二年，“红楼梦辨”换了“红楼梦研究”的书名出版时，除了更换一小部分文章和删去每篇篇末注的年月日以外，绝大部分并未改动，有时甚至仅仅删去了文中“胡适之先生”等字样，而把胡适之的观点却全部作为俞平伯先生自己的观点保留下来。
    俞平伯先生研究红楼梦的方法，也是唯心主义、主观主义的方法。他曾公开宣称：
      “对于文艺，除掉赏鉴以外，不妨作一种
  研究；但这研究，不当称为历史的或科学的，
  只是趣味的研究。……欣赏文艺时附带一点研
  究，亦只是逢场作戏而已。若拿了一把解剖刀
  来大割，恐怕割来割去了无所得。这不怪你的
  手术欠佳，或你的宝刀欠快，只是‘割鸡焉用
  牛刀’耳。……这种（趣味的）研究，其对象
  和方法都不是固定的。如果你把研究释为固定

  闹着顽亦可。”（“红楼梦辨的修正”，一九二
  五年三月七日“现代评论”）
    从俞平伯先生三十年来研究红楼梦的实践来看，他正是本着这个宗旨，凭着个人的爱好，在这种“趣味的研究”上，费了不少心血。他的一部分研究成果在整理材料、辨伪存真上是有作用的。但是，我们肯定这部分作用，并不意味着我们赞同或者容忍俞平伯先生研究红楼梦的资产阶级立场、观点和方法。他否认红楼梦的现实主义精神，否认红楼梦人物在典型环境中的典型性格。这种立场观点以及主观和繁琐的研究方法，对读者来说，必然会把他们引到歧路上去，引导他们把红楼梦中统一的、有机的生活，分割为片面的、孤立的现象，从而寻根究底，考证“寿怡红群芳开夜宴”的座次，追寻秦可卿和贾宝玉的暧昧关系，研究“贾宝玉为什么尽吃稀的”等等。这种舍本逐末、“可怜无补费精神”的研究，俞平伯先生自己“闹着顽”，自然“亦可”，对于广大的迫切需要从古典文学作品中吸取滋养的读者特别是青年读者，是没有什么好处的。
    但是，读者的思想认识水平和鉴别力是不断在提高的，进步的青年人再不能容忍资产阶级的立场、观点、方法任意损害和歪曲我们伟大民族的优秀文学遗产。李希凡、蓝翎两位所写的两篇文章就驳斥了俞平伯先生对红楼梦的这种曲解。
    李希凡和蓝翎两位所写的两篇文章，从历史唯物主义观点出发，指出“红楼梦出现在满清帝国的乾隆盛世，并不是偶然的现象。乾隆时代正是满清皇朝行将衰败的前奏曲。在这一巨变中注定了封建官僚地主阶级不可避免的死亡命运。”“贾氏的衰败……是整个封建官僚地主阶级在逐渐形成的新的历史条件下必然走向崩溃的征兆。贾氏的衰败可能有很多原因，但最基本的是社会的经济的原因。”如果将这个观点和胡适之们的观点相对照，就不难看出红楼梦“考证的权威”是站在什么立场上的了。胡适之在“红楼梦考证”中说红楼梦是曹雪芹“描写他家由富贵变成贫穷的情形。我们看曹寅一生的历史，决不像一个贪官污吏；他家所以后来衰败，他的儿子所以亏空破产，大概都是由于他一家都爱挥霍，爱摆阔架子；讲究吃喝，讲究场面；收藏精本的书，刻行精刻的书；交结文人名士，交结贵族大官，招待皇帝，至于四次五次；他们又不会理财，又不肯节省；讲究挥霍惯了，收缩不回来，以致于亏空，以致于破产抄家。”这岂不是活脱脱的物伤其类的叹息口吻？
    李希凡和蓝翎两位的文章，着重批评了俞平伯先生在研究红楼梦的工作中的唯心主义、主观主义的观点。指出俞平伯先生由于没有从现实主义的原则去探讨红楼梦的鲜明的反封建倾向，从抽象的艺术观点出发，迷惑于所谓“怨而不怒的风格”，“实质上是企图减低红楼梦反封建的现实意义”。也批评了俞平伯先生确认“红楼梦的主要观念是色空”的反现实主义的谬论，指出红楼梦决不是“色空观念”的具体化，而是活生生的现实人生的悲剧，“人们通过作者笔下的主人公的悲剧命运所得的教育不是堕入命定论的深渊，而是激发起对于封建统治者及其全部制度的深刻的憎恨，对于肯定人物宝玉黛玉的热烈同情。”
    其次，这两篇文章批评了俞平伯先生在论及红楼梦的传统性时的形式主义的断语，认为红楼梦的传统性是表现在对古典文学作品人民性的继承和发扬；对正面典型的创造和热烈歌颂；和对现实主义创作方法的忠实，而决不是如俞平伯先生所分析和引用的，仅是东拼西凑，抄袭前文，说是什么“传统性”。
    这两篇文章还指出俞平伯先生的文学批评原则是反现实主义的，他企图否定红楼梦是一部伟大的现实主义悲剧，从而把红楼梦歪曲成为一部自然主义的写生的作品。
    尽管这两篇文章可能有一些小缺点，但这些小缺点，是无损于这两篇文章的总的倾向和战斗精神的。应该说，这两篇文章，是三十多年来向古典文学研究工作中胡适之派的资产阶级立场、观点、方法进行反击的第一枪，可贵的第一枪！
    这一枪之所以可贵，就是因为我们的文艺界，对胡适之派的“新红学家”们的资产阶级立场、观点、方法在全国解放后仍然在古典文学研究工作中占统治地位这一危险的事实，视若无睹。这两篇文章发表前后在文艺界似乎并没有引起应有的重视。是的，我们曾经号召学习一切优秀的民族文学艺术遗产，国家出版社也整理出版了红楼梦和其他一些古典文学名著，这样做是必要的，但这决不能算是已经接受和发扬文学遗产了。只有以马克思主义的立场、观点、方法，来研究古典文学作品，真正做到取其民主性的精华，去其封建性的糟粕，才能使这些遗产成为全民的艺术财富的宝贵的一部分，成为发展社会主义现实主义文学艺术的必要基础。但是，我们对于优秀的文学遗产——如红楼梦的研究工作，迄今为止，仍未脱离资产阶级的唯心主义、主观主义、反现实主义的影响。这样发展下去，就不可能使人民从古典文学作品中认识真实的历史，不可能使人民认识文学作品作为社会斗争的工具的政治意义，不可能真正地认识优秀的古典文学作品的价值，从而热爱我们民族的珍贵的文学遗产。
    现在，问题已经提到人们的面前了，对这问题应该展开讨论。这个问题，按其思想实质来说，是工人阶级对资产阶级在思想战线上的又一次严重的斗争。这个斗争的目的，应该是辨清是非黑白，在古典文学研究工作的领域里清除资产阶级的唯心主义的、主观主义的立场、观点和方法；正确地学习运用马克思主义的唯物主义的、科学的立场、观点和方法。每个文艺工作者，不管它是不是专门从事古典文学研究工作的，都必须重视这个思想斗争。这不是对哪一个个别的人的问题。对任何人在研究和考证工作上的或多或少有益的贡献，都是应该尊重的。但是应该坚决反对一切资产阶级的立场、观点和方法，不管它以什么名目出现。
