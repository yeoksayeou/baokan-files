Liaoning Province Agricultural Machinery and Tractor Stations Dispatch Over One Hundred Tractors to Cultivate Land for State-Owned Farms and Agricultural Production Cooperatives

The twelve agricultural machinery and tractor stations in Liaoning Province have dispatched one hundred and nine tractors to begin autumn plowing for nineteen state-owned farms, two collective farms, and more than two hundred and thirty agricultural production cooperatives, with a preliminary plan to plow six thousand hectares of land in the autumn.

Well before the autumn plowing began, the tractor stations in various locations undertook a great deal of preparatory work, creating many favorable conditions for the autumn plowing. After the cessation of hoeing, the Yixian Tractor Station organized cadres in the service base village—Hejiatun Village, Third District—to conduct land surveys and preliminary regionalization work, greatly facilitating the mechanized autumn plowing operations. The Haicheng Tractor Station began mobilizing and organizing agricultural production cooperatives preparing to use tractors for autumn plowing from August, promoting early ripening of crops, timely harvesting, and early delivery of manure, striving to advance the autumn plowing schedule. Before the autumn plowing, the Gaiping Tractor Station repeatedly tested the tractors and adjusted and connected the machinery, and also trained twelve strong and hardworking high school graduates from the agricultural production cooperatives to assist the farm implement operators and drivers. Tractor stations in Changtu, Tieling, Suizhong, and Beizhen also carried out a series of preparatory work such as land surveys, preliminary regionalization, and machinery adjustment, connection, and inspection.

Currently, each tractor station has begun autumn plowing for its service recipients according to the contract. The Xinjin Tractor Station signed a land cultivation contract with the Hongxing and other nine agricultural production cooperatives, and began operations on October 17. In the operations, the station implemented a zoned land responsibility system and formulated short-term small-segment plans to ensure the quality of autumn plowing operations.

    辽宁省农业机器拖拉机站出动一百多台拖拉机
    替国营农场和农业生产合作社耕地
    辽宁省十二处农业机器拖拉机站，出动一百零九台拖拉机开始为十九处国营农场、两个集体农庄和二百三十多个农业生产合作社进行秋翻地，初步计划秋翻六千垧地。
    早在开始秋翻前，各地拖拉机站都做了很多准备工作，给秋翻创造了很多有利条件。义县拖拉机站在挂锄后组织干部在服务的基点村——三区贺家屯村进行了土地调查和初步区划的工作，大大便利了秋翻机耕作业。海城拖拉机站从八月份就开始动员和组织准备用拖拉机秋翻的农业生产合作社促进作物早熟，及时收割拉打和提早送粪，争取提前秋翻。盖平拖拉机站在秋翻前反复地进行了拖拉机的试车和机具的调整和连结工作，同时还训练了十二名农业生产合作社内的身体强壮、劳动好的高小毕业生，协助农具手和驾驶员工作。昌图、铁岭、绥中、北镇等拖拉机站也都进行了土地调查勘测、初步区划和机具调整连结、检修等一系列的准备工作。
    目前，各拖拉机站都按代耕合同开始为服务对象进行秋翻。新金拖拉机站和红星等九个农业生产合作社签定了代耕合同，已在十月十七日开始作业，在作业中站内实行了分区包地责任制和制订了短期小段计划，以保证秋翻作业质量。
