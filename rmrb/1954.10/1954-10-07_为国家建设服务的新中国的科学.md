New China's Science Serving National Construction
National People's Congress Representative
Director of the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences Qian Sanqiang

Although China's science itself has a long and glorious history, academic development stagnated due to the long-term stagnation of feudal society. Modern scientific research was introduced with the aggression of capitalist countries, so it was initially marked with a semi-colonial character. It was deeply influenced by Europe and the United States, advocated personal interests, pursued trivial issues, and was divorced from production practice.

With the establishment and growth of New China, China's scientific undertakings have also entered a new historical period. In the past five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have carried out various social reform movements, which have brought profound changes to all aspects of Chinese society; in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, they repelled the aggression of U.S. imperialism, defended the security of the motherland, and raised China's international status; at the same time, they completed the economic recovery work and victoriously entered a new period of planned national economic construction. In these years, the thinking of the vast majority of scientific workers has also been significantly improved, and scientific work has been linked to national construction on a broad basis. New China's science has become an indispensable part of the people's cause. Its central goal is to serve the people and serve national construction; it takes dialectical materialism and historical materialism as its guiding ideology, and it takes the advanced science of the Soviet Union as its example to learn from.

Since 1953, national scientific research institutions have begun to formulate plans, and planned research work has become an integral part of national economic development. Taking the Chinese Academy of Sciences as an example, approximately 60 percent of the research topics are proposed by various ministries of the government or production departments, and the remaining 40 percent are exploratory questions in basic science and social science. From a long-term perspective, most of these works are still combined with practice. In short, the combination of science and life, the connection between theory and practice, and the creative cooperation between scientific institutions and production departments have become a huge force driving China's scientific progress. In the past five years, China's scientific work has made many contributions to the country.

The following briefly lists several aspects to illustrate the new look of science in our country.

In order to cooperate with the establishment of industrial bases and the construction of huge projects, scientific workers and staff of economic construction departments have conducted a large number of surveys, investigations, and research work on the development and utilization of power and resources. The focus of the investigation of underground resources is on the exploration of iron, copper, tungsten, tin, manganese, coal, and oil. Through the joint efforts of geologists, geophysical prospectors, and drilling workers, a large number of new mineral deposits have been discovered, such as the copper mine in Gansu and the manganese mine in Guangxi; the old mining areas have also been greatly expanded, such as the iron mine in Hebei and the coal mine in Heilongjiang, which have expanded more than tenfold; several kinds of non-ferrous metals and rare elements have also been found to be abundant in our country. In addition, with the progress of large-scale exploration work, geologists and paleontologists have also studied the genesis of certain ore deposits and clarified the stratigraphic division of certain areas. A large number of young people have poured into the glorious vanguard of the motherland's industrial construction. Speaking only of geophysical workers, the current team has expanded dozens of times compared with before liberation.

Due to the needs of basic construction design, earthquake work has also developed. At present, more than a dozen seismic stations have been established, and seismic intensities of dozens of new and old industrial cities or regions have been determined to support basic construction. In this work, in addition to the certain role played by seismologists, historians systematically sorted out historical earthquake data in a short period of time, and architects and mechanics made important contributions to the identification of seismic intensity by inferring the seismic resistance properties of ancient buildings, and established a good foundation for comprehensive research.

Meteorological research has also achieved significant results. Many meteorological stations have now been added in China. Based on a large amount of observation, advanced Soviet meteorological theories have been studied, which has improved the accuracy of short-term weather forecasts, and medium-term weather forecasts have also begun. The prediction of disastrous weather such as typhoons, cold waves, and rainfall has also played a significant role in the struggle to overcome natural disasters. At the same time, the improvement of the efficiency of meteorological undertakings has favorably supported national defense construction. The key to the major achievements of meteorological undertakings since liberation lies in the creative cooperation between research departments and business departments and the study of advanced Soviet science in combination with China's actual situation.

In 1951, with the peaceful liberation of Tibet, a Tibet working team was organized. After more than two years of work, the team discovered rich mineral deposits such as iron, coal, and non-ferrous metals, as well as hydropower resources, providing scientific data for the Tibetan people to develop Tibet's rich resources. They also planted many crops, such as winter wheat, winter rye, millet, various vegetables, melons, and beans, proving that the Tibetan plateau can expand the planting area and increase agricultural output.

In the process of industrial recovery and development, scientific work has also made beneficial contributions. The imitation and improvement of ductile iron has been successful and widely promoted, saving steel and saving the country a lot of funds; now, creative research is being further conducted on the rolling processing of ductile iron in order to expand its scope of use. In line with the needs of metallurgical enterprises, the beneficiation of lean iron ore and lean manganese ore has been completed, expanding the scope of resource utilization. In order to cooperate with the establishment of new iron and steel bases, metallurgists, chemists, geologists, physicists, etc. have launched comprehensive research. In addition, new research has also been launched on non-ferrous metals and rare elements.

In cooperation with the fuel industry, a series of research work such as analysis, identification, refining, and processing of natural petroleum and shale oil has been carried out; new achievements have been made in the research of molten iron catalysts for synthetic petroleum, and fluidization engineering technology has been mastered, creating favorable conditions for the development of the synthetic petroleum industry.

The manufacture of optical glass has begun to establish a good foundation, actively supporting the national defense industry and the manufacture of measuring instruments. The research and design of optical instruments have successfully trial-produced high-magnification oil immersion microscopes, and the performance of the finished products exceeds that of some capitalist countries. The successful trial production of hard alloy and corundum ceramic knives helps to promote the high-speed cutting method in the machinery industry.

In order to open up new power sources, use new materials, and establish new research methods, meaningful work has also been carried out in nuclear physics and electronics. In solid-state physics, a series of studies have been conducted on magnetic materials, metals, and crystals, proving that the oscillation of discolored colored crystal is as effective as colorless crystal. Mechanics and mathematics workers have also begun to conduct research in combination with the needs of engineering and physics.

The research on synthetic rubber, plexiglass, and phenolic aldehyde resins has been successful, thereby powerfully supporting national defense construction and heavy industry construction. On the other hand, research on various dyes, sulfonamides, antimalarials, and antibiotics has also been gradually carried out, and several research results have been adopted by production departments.

The investigation and research of biology and soil play a major role in increasing agricultural production and forestry construction. The Bima No. 1 wheat variety selected and bred in Shaanxi has the advantages of rust resistance and lodging resistance, and the yield exceeds the local original variety by 20% to 30%. It is currently being promoted on 6.3 million mu of land; the research results of soybean rhizobia have been promoted on 20 million mu of land, which can increase soybean production by about 10%; the research results of peanut rhizobia have been promoted on 2 million mu of land, which can increase peanut production by about 20%. In terms of soil improvement and utilization, it also provides scientific data for the rational fertilization and expansion of cultivated land area of ​​the large area of ​​abandoned red soil in Jiangxi.

The research on insects mainly focuses on agricultural pests. The research on cotton aphids has put forward prevention and control methods, which have been adopted on 110,000 mu of cotton fields, which can increase cotton production. The locust plague can basically be controlled, and the fundamental method of eliminating locusts will be further found from the research on the life history and habits of locusts. On the other hand, preliminary results have also been obtained in the research on crop diseases, such as apple rot and wheat smut. In addition, the historical rinderpest has been controlled, and the antisera and vaccines for hog cholera and anthrax have also been widely used.

For the problem of freshwater fish farming, we have conducted investigation work in the 8 million mu of lake area in Hubei and put forward stocking suggestions; there are also methods for fish disease prevention and control. The research on the migration patterns and marine environment of chub mackerel and Spanish mackerel groups in the Bohai Bay provides a scientific basis for the rational setting of fishing grounds and rational fishing.

In terms of medicine and health, what should be mentioned first is that bacteriologists, pathologists, entomologists, etc. actively participated in the struggle against the U.S. imperialist germ warfare, scientifically exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialism, and won the victory against germ warfare together with the broad masses of the people. In addition, prevention and treatment methods have been obtained for Japanese encephalitis B, kala-azar, and malaria, which have reduced the incidence of the disease and protected the health of the people.

While conducting resource surveys and cooperating with production and construction tasks, the work of several theoretical departments has also established a foundation. In physics, there is research on nuclear force and atomic dislocation phenomena in metals, and cosmic ray observation work is also being carried out; in mathematics, research is being conducted on mathematical analysis, geometry and topology, algebra, number theory, and probability theory, and "The Theory of Accumulation Prime Numbers," "The Theory of Projective Space Curves," and "The Sum of Orthogonal Function Series" and other works have been compiled and published. In combination with the work of synthetic rubber, synthetic petroleum, and antibiotics, the research on polymer structure, catalyst, and stereochemistry of citrinin has been developed. In biology, the research on biogenic stimulators clarifies the metabolic response of tissue extracts to red blood cells and can regenerate rotifers; the results of hybrid hybridization of silkworms affirm the process of polyspermy participating in biological fertilization, refuting the futility of chromosome inheritance theory; the research of physiology and biochemistry has also established a good foundation. Physiologists, biochemists, and psychologists universally conducted systematic learning of Pavlov's theory in 1953. The work on cytology, anatomy, histology, etc. is also gradually established on the basis of learning the theory of living matter. Agricultural and biological science workers are also absorbing Michurin's advanced theory, combining it with the rich experience of the working people, and conducting theoretical research to increase yield per unit area and improve varieties.

In social sciences, the focus of historical research is modern history, especially the study of the history of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the revolutionary struggle over the past 30 years. Many specialized works have been published, among which Chen Boda's "Mao Zedong on the Chinese Revolution" and Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Chinese Communist Party" are important contributions. Much work has also been done in the collection and整理 (zhěnglǐ, tidying, sorting, organizing) of historical materials. The study of ancient history published Guo Moruo's "The Age of Slavery" and Fan Wenlan's first compilation of "A Brief History of China." Due to large-scale basic construction in various places, the cultural relics unearthed in the past five years have exceeded the total of excavations in the past few decades, providing rich new materials for the study of Chinese archaeology and ancient history. The work of linguistics focuses on the formulation of writing systems for ethnic minorities that have no writing systems and the investigation and research of Chinese grammar. Economics is conducting the collection of economic historical materials and the investigation and research of handicrafts in the past hundred years.

From the above briefly listed aspects, it can be seen that the scientific achievements of New China in the past five years are multi-faceted. Due to following the correct direction of combining with national construction, science in our country has achieved unprecedented development. However, facing the construction of our country today and in the future, the work in the past five years is still far from enough, and we should make further efforts. Especially when our planned economic construction has just taken the first step, we must bear in mind the instructions given to us by Chairman Mao Zedong in his opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress, "The people of our country should work hard, work hard to learn the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, be honest and diligent, encourage and help each other, avoid any boasting and pride, and prepare to build our current economically and culturally backward country into a industrialized great country with a high degree of modern culture within a few five-year plans," learn with humility and prudence, work diligently, combine our own business, work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, overcome our various bourgeois individualistic thoughts, and establish the collectivist thoughts of the working class; cultivate young people in large quantities and strive to improve our professional level. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, under the encouragement and supervision of the people of the country, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, as long as we continue to work hard, we can change the current backward state of science in the near future, proportionally organize various sciences into an organic whole, comprehensively but with emphasis on promoting various sciences according to national needs and the laws of scientific development, and effectively contribute our own strength to our country's gradual transition to socialism.

    为国家建设服务的新中国的科学
    全国人民代表大会代表
    中国科学院物理研究所所长  钱三强
    我国科学本身虽然有长远的光荣的历史，但是由于封建社会的长期停滞，学术的发展也因而停滞下来。近代的科学研究，是伴随着资本主义国家的侵略而输入的，因此一开始它便带上了半殖民地性的烙印，它深受欧美的影响，崇尚个人兴趣，追求枝节问题，脱离生产实际。
    随着新中国的建立和成长，中国的科学事业也进入了一个新的历史时期。五年来，中国人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的领导下，进行了各种社会改革运动，使中国社会各方面都起了深刻的变化；在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，打退了美帝国主义的侵略，保卫了祖国的安全，提高了我国的国际地位；同时，完成了经济恢复工作，并胜利地进入有计划的国民经济建设的新时期。在这几年当中，绝大部分科学工作者的思想也有了显著的提高，科学工作已在广泛的基础上和国家建设联系起来。新中国的科学已成为人民事业的不可缺少的一部分，它的中心目标是服务于人民，服务于国家建设；它以辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义作为指导思想，它以苏联先进科学作为自己学习的榜样。
    从一九五三年起，全国的科学研究机构开始制定计划，有计划的研究工作成为国民经济发展的组成部分。以中国科学院而论，大约有百分之六十的研究题目是由政府各部或生产部门提出来的，其余的百分之四十则是属于基础科学方面的和社会科学方面的探索性的问题，从长远角度来看，这些工作大部分仍是结合实际的。总之，科学和生活结合、理论和实际联系、科学机关和生产部门的创造性合作已成为推动我国科学前进的巨大力量，五年来我国的科学工作已为国家作出了不少的贡献。
    在下面略举几方面的情况来说明我国科学的新面貌。
    为了配合工业基地的建立，巨大工程的设施，科学工作者们和经济建设部门的工作人员一起，对动力和资源的开发和利用，进行了大量的调查考察和研究工作。对地下资源的调查，重点是放在铁、铜、钨、锡、锰、煤和石油的勘探方面，经过地质学家、物理探矿学家和钻探工作者的协同努力，新的矿藏已大量被发现，如甘肃的铜矿、广西的锰矿等；旧的矿区也在极大的程度上扩大了，如河北的铁矿、黑龙江的煤矿都扩大到十倍以上；若干种有色金属和稀有原素，在我国也都找到了丰富的藏量。此外，随着大规模勘探工作的进展，地质学家和古生物学家们还研究了某些矿床的成因，弄清了若干地区的地层划分。大量的青年涌入了光荣的祖国工业建设先遣队，单就地球物理工作者讲，现在的队伍比解放前便扩大了几十倍。
    由于基本建设设计的需要，地震工作也有了发展，目前，已建立了十几处地震台，作出数十个新旧工业城市或地区的地震裂度，支援了基本建设。在这个工作中，除了地震学家起了一定的作用，历史学家在短期内系统地整理出历史上的地震资料，建筑学家和力学家对于古建筑进行的抗震性质的推断，都对地震裂度的鉴定作了重要的贡献，并且为综合性的研究建立了良好的基础。
    气象的研究也有显著的成绩。现在国内已增设了许多气象台站，在大量观测的基础上，学习苏联先进的气象理论，使短期天气预告的准确度提高了，中期天气预告也已开始。对于灾害性天气如台风、寒潮及降雨量的预告，在战胜自然灾害的斗争中也起了显著的作用。同时气象事业效率的提高有利地支援了国防建设。解放以来，气象事业获得重大成就的关键在于研究部门和业务部门创造性的合作和结合我国的实际情况学习苏联先进科学。
    一九五一年，随着和平解放西藏，组织了西藏工作队。该队经过两年多的工作，发现了铁、煤、有色金属等丰富矿藏和水力资源，为藏族人民开发西藏富源提供了科学资料。他们还种植了许多作物，如冬小麦、冬黑麦、小米、各种蔬菜、瓜、豆等，证明西藏高原可以扩大种植面积和提高农业产量。
    在工业的恢复和发展的过程中，科学工作也作出了有益的贡献。球墨铸铁的仿制和改进已获得成功，并大量推广，节约了钢材，为国家节省了大量资金；现在并进一步对于球墨铸铁的压延加工进行了创造性的研究，以求推广它的使用范围。配合冶金企业的需要，完成了贫铁矿、贫锰矿的选矿工作，扩大了资源利用的范围。为了配合新的钢铁基地的建立，冶金学家、化学家、地质学家、物理学家等展开了综合性的研究。此外对于有色金属和稀有原素也展开了新的研究。
    配合燃料工业，对天然石油、页岩油进行了分析鉴定、炼制加工等一系列的研究工作；对于合成石油的熔铁催化剂的研究有了新的成就，并掌握了流体化工程技术，为人造石油工业的发展创造了有利的条件。
    光学玻璃的制造已开始建立了良好的基础，积极地支持了国防工业和测量仪器的制造。光学仪器的研究和设计已成功地试制出高倍率油浸显微镜，成品性能超过某些资本主义国家的出品。硬质合金和钢玉质瓷刀试制成功，有助于机械工业高速切削法的推广。
    为了新的动力的开辟、新的材料的使用和新的研究方法的树立，在原子核物理和电子学方面也进行了有意义的工作。在固体物理方面作了关于磁性物质、金属、结晶体等一系列的研究，证明了有色水晶去色后其振荡性和无色水晶同等有效。力学和数学工作者也开始结合着工程和物理的需要进行研究。
    人造橡胶、有机玻璃和酚酫树脂等塑料的研究已成功，从而有力地支持了国防建设和重工业建设。另一方面，对各种染料、磺胺剂、抗疟剂及抗生素的研究也已逐渐开展，并有若干研究结果已为生产部门所采用。
    生物和土壤的调查和研究，对农业增产及林业建设起着重大的作用。在陕西选育的碧玛一号小麦品种具有抗锈和不倒伏的优点，收获量超过当地原有品种百分之二十到三十，目前已在六百三十万亩土地上推广；大豆根瘤菌的研究结果已在二千万亩土地上推广，可使大豆增产百分之十左右；花生根瘤菌的研究结果已在二百万亩土地上推广，可使花生增产百分之二十左右。在土壤的改良和利用方面，对江西大面积的荒弃的红壤合理施肥和扩大耕地面积也提供了科学资料。
    昆虫的研究以农业害虫为主要研究对象。对棉花蚜虫的研究提出了防治的办法，已在十一万亩棉田上采用，可使棉花增产。蝗虫的灾害基本上已能控制，并将进一步从对蝗虫生活史和习性方面的研究找出根本消灭蝗虫的办法。另一方面，在作物病害的研究上，对苹果腐烂和小麦黑穗病等的研究也获得了初步结果。此外，历史性的牛瘟已能控制，猪瘟及炭疽病的防治血清和疫苗，也已大量使用。
    对于淡水鱼的养殖问题我们已在湖北八百万亩的湖泊区域进行了调查工作，并提出了放养建议；鱼病防治也有了办法。对渤海湾的鲐鱼、鲅鱼鱼群回游规律和海洋环境的研究，为合理设置渔场和合理捕鱼提供了科学根据。
    在医药卫生方面，首先应该提出的是细菌学家、病理学家、昆虫学家等踊跃地参加了反对美帝国主义细菌战的斗争，从科学上揭发了美帝国主义的罪行，并和广大人民在一起取得了反细菌战的胜利。此外对于乙型大脑炎、黑热病和疟疾都获得了防治的办法，减少了发病率，保护了人民的健康。
    在和资源调查、配合生产建设任务的同时，若干理论部门的工作也建立了基础。在物理方面有关于原子核力、金属中原子脱节现象的研究，同时对宇宙线也进行了观测工作；在数学方面进行了数学分析、几何与柘扑、代数、数论和概率论等方面的研究，整理和出版了“堆垒素数论”、“射影空间曲线论”和“直交函数级数的和”等著作。结合着人造橡胶、人造石油、抗生素等的工作，发展了高分子结构、催化剂和桔霉素的立体化学的研究。在生物学方面，关于生物原刺激素的研究，阐明了组织浸出液对红色细胞的代谢感应，并能使轮虫再生；家蚕混精杂交的结果肯定了多精子参加生物受精的过程，驳斥了染色体遗传理论的虚妄；生理学和生物化学的研究也建立了良好的基础。生理学家、生物化学家、心理学家在一九五三年内普遍地进行了巴甫洛夫学说的系统学习。关于细胞学、解剖学、组织学等方面的工作也在学习生活物质学说的基础上逐步建立起来。农业、生物科学工作者也正在吸收米丘林先进理论，结合着劳动人民的丰富经验，为增加单位面积产量和改良品种而进行着理论的研究。
    社会科学方面，史学研究的重点是近代史，特别是对三十年来中国共产党领导革命斗争的历史的研究，出版了不少专门著作，其中陈伯达的“毛泽东论中国革命”和胡乔木的“中国共产党的三十年”是重要的贡献。在史料的搜集和整理方面也作了不少工作。对古代史的研究出版了郭沫若的“奴隶制时代”和范文澜的“中国通史简编”第一编。由于各地大规模的基本建设，五年来出土文物超过了过去数十年发掘的总和，为中国考古学及上古史的研究提供了丰富的新的资料。语言学的工作着重为尚无文字的少数民族制订文字和汉语语法的调查研究。经济学则进行近百年来经济史料的搜集和手工业的调查和研究。
    由上面略举的几方面情况，可以看出新中国五年来的科学成就是多方面的，由于遵循着结合国家建设的正确方向，我国科学获得了空前的发展。但是，面对着我国今天和将来的建设，这五年来的工作还是十分不够的，我们还应该作进一步的努力。特别在我们有计划的经济建设刚迈第一步的时候，我们必须切记毛泽东主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕词中给我们的指示，“我国人民应当努力工作，努力学习苏联和各兄弟国家的先进经验，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，互勉互助，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲，准备在几个五年计划之内，将我们现在这样一个经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的国家”，谦虚谨慎地学习，兢兢业业地工作，结合自己的业务，努力学习马克思列宁主义，克服我们形形色色的资产阶级的个人主义的思想，树立起工人阶级的集体主义的思想；大量地培养青年，努力提高业务水平。我们深信，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的领导下，在全国人民的鼓励和督促下，在苏联的无私的帮助下，只要我们不断努力，就可以在不久的将来改变今天科学还落后的状态，按比例地将各门科学组成为有机整体，依据国家需要和科学发展规律，全面地、但有重点地推动各门科学，为我国逐步地过渡到社会主义有效地贡献出自己的力量。
