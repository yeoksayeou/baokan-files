　　The People's Power to Move Mountains and Overturn Seas
　　Li Rui
    On the eve of National Day, the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters issued an order to revoke the alarm signals stipulated for "just in case" and the special telephone numbers set up for warnings. On October 5, the "Changjiang Daily" announced the final release of the Jianghan Pass water level. It has been a full hundred days and nights from the frenzied invasion of the flood to the docile return of the river. Every moment of these hundred days was a struggle for life and death. However, the people finally won, and the Yangtze River obediently succumbed to the people's feet again. This victory added a new page to the history of the people of Wuhan, and also added a glorious touch to the overall picture of China's victory in 1954.
    This struggle was a great test for the 1.5 million people of Wuhan. Like a mirror, it clearly showed that under the leadership of the Party, thousands upon thousands of ordinary people united together are giants who can hold up the sky. The ancient saying, "If you point to the sea, the sea will boil; if you point to the mountain, the mountain will shake," is a true reflection of the heroic people of the Mao Zedong era.
    This year's Yangtze River flood, as everyone already knows, was the largest flood in nearly a century. The magnitude of the water was equivalent to the sum of the 1931 Hankou flood and the 1949 flood. However, the opponent it encountered was also a huge force rarely seen in history. As soon as the Party's mobilization order was issued, thousands upon thousands of workers, farmers, PLA soldiers, shop assistants and residents, cadres and students poured onto the dike front like a tide. As the water continued to rise, our flood control team continued to expand; initially, it was a 100,000-strong flood control army, then it became 140,000, and later it became 200,000. On stormy nights, every street and every organization had reserve commando teams "ready for battle." At the slightest command, they immediately rushed to the front. Thousands of cars sped day and night; hundreds of barges shuttled back and forth on the river. At the most tense moments, airplanes from thousands of miles away sent divers dispatched by the Central Government, and trains traveled on flooded tracks, carrying tens of thousands of tons of yellow earth and rocks. On and off the dike, front and rear, the sky and the river were all supporting this battle.
    Workers mining earth and stone formed teams of hundreds and thousands to mine stone and dig earth in Baijia Mountain, Qijiawan, Fengshi Mountain, Chenjia Mountain and other places dozens of miles away from the city, supplying the urgent needs of the front. Due to the urgency of the task, they did not have time to build sheds in advance, and immediately worked in the barren mountains in the rainstorm without waiting for a moment; when there was no place to sleep at night, they used carrying poles to prop up the rain cloth, and spent the night in the rain back to back; the wind blew out the lighting torches, and they used songs and slogans to connect with each other, continuing to dig and carry in the dark night. The rainstorm and mud made it impossible for them to see the road and get on the boat boards, so many people took off their clothes and laid them on the boat boards. In this way, many barren mountains were leveled, and tens of thousands of tons of yellow earth and giant rocks were moved to the dike front. In more than three months, more than 2.7 million cubic meters of earth and stone were excavated. If these earth and stones were placed to form a dike one meter high and one meter wide, it could extend from Wuhan all the way to Qiqihar in the Northeast.
    From the beginning of the battle, it was a "race against the flood." "The dike rises as the water rises" was everyone's slogan. However, "running ahead of the flood" was not easy. Raising a sub-dike by one burlap sack meant 500,000 sacks across the entire line. Especially when the flood level broke 29 meters, every minute and every second was precious. Chen Guoxue, a first-class meritorious worker, broke two carrying poles in a few days and became ill from exhaustion in order to carry more soil and save time, but he still insisted on going to the dike to work. Tong Haiyin, a second-class meritorious worker, saw that the滔滔 flood was about to rise above the dike, so in order to save time, he often carried two loads at a time with two carrying poles and ran quickly. The principal of the Rongjun School was a third-class disabled soldier, and his injury was on his foot, but he still insisted on not resting. Wang Xiangyu, a woman in her sixties with white hair and a disabled arm, also voluntarily joined the team of soil carriers. The ramming workers accelerated from a speed of 30 strokes per minute to 50 strokes and 60 strokes per minute in order to save time. In this way, they turned the myth of "the dike rises as the water rises" into reality. In many sections, the work of raising the dike had just been completed when the surging flood peak arrived.
    The three-month-long emergency rescue struggle was extremely tense work. Due to the prolonged submersion by the high water level, there were major and minor dangers almost every day in every section. "A thousand-mile dike can be destroyed by an anthill." If any section, any moment, or any patrol team was slightly negligent, the entire dike could be ruined. The members of the patrol team, like mothers caring for sick babies, guarded and observed day and night, from the top of the dike to the bottom, from the outer slope to the inner slope, not willing to let go of an inch of land. In the dark night, when the lights were blown out by the wind, they used their ears to listen to the water sound; in places where they could not distinguish between rainwater and seepage, they jumped down and used their feet to test the cold and warmth of the water to distinguish. Zhang Yunchang, a patrolling soldier, patrolled for dangers at night, kneeling on the dike, inch by inch, extending his hand into the water to touch carefully. His pants were worn through, and his knees were worn bloody, but he did not know it at all. PLA soldiers He Youhu, Deng Guansheng, and Li Yanlin, etc., in order to find dangerous situations, used ropes to tie themselves and fell into the deep water that submerged their necks, finding more than a hundred cracks in one night. Once a major pipe leak was discovered in the stinky mud pond at the bottom of the dike, patrolling soldiers jumped down without even taking off their new clothes and insisted on working in the stinky water and sludge for several hours, finally eliminating the hidden danger in time. When the sound of gongs signaling a major danger rang, the rescue team rushed into battle like soldiers charging with bayonets. When a crack was found in the underground ditch under the dike on Zhengluokou Main Street and the flood surged in, Han Youmei, an eighteen-year-old young woman, disregarded the rapid flow of water and jumped into the water without hesitation. On the night of July 29, when a dangerous situation occurred in a section of Zhanggong Dike, soldier Luo Guangtian disregarded everything and blocked the hole with his own body. The immortal martyr Comrade Jia Mingwu was a model for thousands upon thousands of such fearless soldiers. He was already exhausted after rescuing a major dangerous project and coming out of the water; but when he discovered another dangerous project, he forgot everything and jumped back into the water with a burlap sack, contributing his precious life to this heroic city.
    "Yu the Great controlled the floods and passed his home three times without entering," which has been passed down as a beautiful story for thousands of years. Today, Mao Zedong's excellent sons and daughters have universally inherited this noble quality of our ancestors. Yuan Xiuzhen, the female head of Cooperation Township, led hundreds of farmers from the entire township to fight the flood on the dike. Her own home was submerged by stagnant water; although it was close at hand, she had not even returned to see it once. She said: "The dike is the lifeline of 1.5 million people, and the lifeline is important." Wan Renhe, an old raftsman of thirty years, had his home submerged by stagnant water. He was sent a letter asking him to go back, but he said: "The rear has people to take care of my family. If I leave, it won't work. If everyone only takes care of their own home first, no one's home will be protected." He worked day and night, putting all his experience and wisdom into the fight against the waves, transforming a large number of scrap iron anchors into useful iron anchors. It was precisely because there were thousands upon thousands of warriors like Wan Renhe that they exerted the power of the collective and created a wave-breaking wooden raft stretching more than ninety miles - the most powerful "underwater Great Wall" to protect the dike body.
    The drainage project was also a miracle. More than 300 pumping machines, like dozens of green dragons, pumped the stagnant water from a vast expanse under Daijia Mountain up the high slopes and into the Yangtze River. In three months, more than 108.888 million cubic meters of stagnant water were drained. According to an old engineer, in the old society, it would take at least six to eight months to design and install these more than 300 pumping machines. However, today, with the collective efforts of all the technicians, electricians, and porters, they completed the work completely in just eight days. In their work, they displayed amazing perseverance and creativity. In order to remove the weeds from the "showerhead" of the water intake pipe, technician Di Shangde disregarded the cold weather and the cold water, braved the rain and worked in the water, persisting for as long as sixteen hours. They finally realized the slogan of "Let the stagnant water roll into the Yangtze River and let the peasant brothers return to their homes early."
    In mid-August, when the flood reached its peak (29.73 meters), railway transportation was cut off by the flood. The situation at the time was extremely critical. In order to support the earth and stone and flood control equipment for the dike front, the brave railway workers raised the rails again and again, raising them six times. Later, the water rose higher and higher, and there was no way to raise the rails any further, so workers Liu Shanyu and others risked their lives to create the eternal miracle of trains running in the water, finally transporting tens of thousands of tons of yellow earth and stone to the dike.
    On the hundred-kilometer-long dike, the touching and praiseworthy deeds, the heroes among the ordinary people, are like stars in the sky, too numerous to count. The people of Wuhan will never forget that 108 martyrs gave their precious lives for this heroic city.
    Every factory in the city, every rural area in the suburbs, street residents, young students, government officials... continuously supported the front. The Fifth Power Plant was located outside the dike on Hanzheng Street. While the workers were "independently fighting" the flood, they ensured industrial and lighting electricity and sent electricity to Zhanggong Dike. The workers at the waterworks raised the water pipes in preparation for "just in case" situations, ensuring that people could drink clean tap water under any circumstances. Hundreds and thousands of women in the streets joined the flood control service team, carrying tens of thousands of loads of tea to the dike; when it was cold and rainy, they sent ginger and brown sugar water, and when it was sunny and hot, they sent licorice and chrysanthemum tea. Countless women shortened their own sleeves when mending clothes for flood control soldiers and tore off the buttons of their loved ones to sew on the clothes of the flood control soldiers who lacked buttons. When a major pipe leak occurred on Hanzheng Street and the flood surged in, many women took out the cotton quilts from their beds and took off their clothes to fill the holes. The wave-breaking wooden rafts on the dike front needed a large number of iron anchors. Nie Xiuzhen, the eighteen-year-old daughter of a boatman, knew that some iron anchors were submerged in the water along the Hanshui River during the flood, so she and several female companions of about the same age drove a fishing boat to salvage them, braving the wind and rain, and persisted in the rapids along the Hanshui River for four days and nights. During the period of the most dangerous situations in early August, a vigorous movement to donate waste bricks and stones was launched in every street. Old Mrs. Shu Xiang, a family member of a dock worker, was already in her sixties. In addition to washing clothes and delivering water every day, she also led her ten-year-old grandson through the mud to pick up stones by the pond, picking up more than 200 kilograms a day. An old man surnamed Gao in Jiang'an District said excitedly: "This year's flood is the largest flood in a century, and the current government is a government that cannot be encountered in a thousand years. I want to live a few more years and take a good look." Saying this, he also donated the stone material that his son had prepared for him to erect a monument. Many old ladies automatically moved out the bricks that had been used to pad chests and cabinets for decades and personally loaded them onto the trucks. In this way, tons of bricks and stones flew out from every street, solving the urgent needs of the front line in time.
    The people in the rear took care of the families of the flood control soldiers and the families of the disaster victims as if they were their own relatives. The grand auditoriums of many government agencies and almost all the classrooms of schools became reception centers for disaster victims. Pan Xiaosuo, a street woman in Baoqing Street, had two sons who died in the flood in the 1931 flood. At that time, there was water everywhere, and there was not even a place to bury the corpses of her sons, so she had to leave them on the roof to be exposed to the wind and sun. Now, she is the women's committee member of the street. She ran around day and night, sending six or seventy pregnant women from the families of flood control workers and disaster victims to the maternal and child health center. She washed more than a thousand pieces of clothing for the flood control workers by herself. She gritted her teeth and said: "The past days can never be allowed to come back!" Her voice is also the voice of the residents of the entire city.
    The students of universities and middle schools bravely joined the struggle from the beginning. The boys participated in the work of digging and carrying soil, and the girls formed groups to participate in the service team on the dike. They quickly linked up with the worker-peasant-soldier brothers and became close brothers and sisters. The girls of the service team made "shoulder pads," made "hand palms," washed and mended clothes, wrote letters to their families and established meritorious service plans for the flood control soldiers.... Someone once counted that their work had 67 kinds; in fact, they did whatever needed to be done. In stormy weather, they did not want the fishy smell of the lake water to get on the workers' clothes, so they tied ropes around their waists and washed in the river water; to mend the soldiers' clothes, many people's long sleeves became short sleeves. They sang "The Glorious Flood Control Army" on behalf of the people in the rear in the morning, but in the afternoon they represented the soldiers on the front and entertained the people's representatives in the rear; so that it was difficult to decide whether they belonged to the front or the rear when evaluating their merits before and after. And this exactly represents their characteristics. They integrated the emotions of the people in the front and rear into one.
    The members of the trade service team and the cooperative service team excellently completed the work of supplying the front. They set up sales sheds on the dike, pushed mobile carts, and carefully and patiently delivered food, clothing, and supplies to every construction site and every shed. The trading company had never sold fried dough sticks; but the soldiers needed them, so they sold fried dough sticks; the cooperative had never sold raw eggs, but the soldiers needed them, so they sold raw eggs. In order to avoid getting the food wet, the service staff of the mobile carts took off their shirts and covered the carts with their clothes when it rained heavily. When bread could not be supplied for a while, they set up a fire on the dike to bake it. They turned the hundred-mile-long dike and many uninhabited barren mountains into bustling markets.
    Batches of cultural troops poured into the front line, and the entire sub-dike was decorated with colorful wall newspapers. Actors of various well-known opera genres in the city went to the dike three or four times to perform in the rain. When a dangerous situation occurred, some actors, still with makeup on their faces, joined the workers in the rescue work.
    Such examples are endless. Thousands of blood vessels in the rear are transfusing blood to the front, supporting the dike front; coupled with the support of the Central Government and the people all over the country, this force is even more powerful, giving the dike front a huge support. Although the floods of the three rivers were fierce, they finally had to succumb to the people.
    Now, the Yangtze River is obediently curled up at the feet of the people. The 200,000-strong flood control army is holding high the red flag of victory, leaving the front line, passing through the streets, and rushing back to their respective posts. Basic construction sites have begun to boil again; the farmers under Daijia Mountain are leading their cattle in groups back to their homes, and planting vegetables again on the land where the stagnant water has been drained; the People's Liberation Army wiped the mud off their bayonets, waiting for the order to advance to liberate Taiwan; the school has already started, and the teachers and students have added a new and vivid socialist teaching material. The three-month-long tense struggle has not only defended the important city of Wuhan, but more valuable, has further tempered the people of Wuhan. Thousands of outstanding people in the flood control army gloriously joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. Everyone who has sweated and worried about the flood control struggle understands more about loving the motherland, loving Wuhan, and loving their work. The people of Wuhan have the determination and confidence to build Wuhan into a beautiful socialist industrialized city.

专栏：武汉人民战胜了历史上的最大洪水

    移山倒海的人民力量
  　李蕤
    国庆节前夕，武汉市防汛指挥部发布命令，撤销为准备“万一”而规定的警报信号和为告警而特设的电话号码。十月五日，“长江日报”宣布最后一次发布江汉关水位的消息。从洪水疯狂的进犯到江水驯顺地归槽，整整经历了一百个日日夜夜。这一百天的每一个时刻，都是生死的斗争。但是，人民终于胜利了，长江又伏伏贴贴地屈服在人们的脚下。这胜利给武汉人民的历史上增加了新的一页，也给整个祖国一九五四年胜利的大图案上添了光彩的一笔。
    这个斗争对于武汉一百五十万人民是一个巨大的考验，它像一面镜子一样使人们清楚地看到：在党的领导下，千千万万的普通人民团结在一起，就是顶天立地的巨人。古语说的“指海海沸腾，指山山动摇”，就是毛泽东时代英雄人民的写照。
    今年长江的洪水，如大家已经知道的，是近百年历史上从没有的大洪水；水势之大，相当于一九三一年汉口大水灾时和一九四九年涨水时的总和。但是，它所逢到的敌手，也是历史上稀见的巨大的队伍。党的动员令一下，千千万万的工人、农民、解放军战士、店员和居民、机关干部和学生就像潮水一样涌上堤防前线。水不断地上涨，我们的防汛队伍也不断在扩大；最初是十万防汛大军，后来成为十四万，以后又成为二十万。在暴风雨的夜晚，每一条街道，每一个机关，都有后备突击队在“枕戈待命”；一声令下，立刻就奔赴前方。成千辆的汽车，日夜不息地风驰电掣般奔驶着；千百只驳船穿梭般在江上来来去去。在最紧张的时候，飞机从几千里外送来中央派来的潜水员，火车在水淹没的轨道上行驶着，载来成万吨的黄土和石块。堤上堤下，前方后方，天空里和江水里都在支援着这个战斗。
    采土采石的工人们，成千成百的结成队伍，到远离市区几十里的栢家山、祁家湾、丰示山、陈家山等地去采石掘土，供应前方的急需。由于任务急迫，他们没有时间预先搭好工棚，就一刻也不等待地冒着暴雨在荒山中工作；夜里没有睡觉的地方，就用扁担撑起雨布，背靠着背在雨中过夜；大风吹熄了照明的火炬，他们就用歌声和口号联系在一起，在黑漆漆的夜色中继续挖，继续挑。暴雨和泥泞使他们看不到路，上不了船板，许多人就脱下自己的衣服垫在船板上。就这样，把许多荒山铲为平地，把成万吨的黄土和巨石，移上堤防前线。在三个多月中，挖土采石达二百七十多万立方公尺。这些土石，如果把它摆成一公尺高一公尺宽的堤，可以从武汉一直延伸到东北的齐齐哈尔。
    从战斗一开始，就是“和洪水赛跑”。“水涨堤高”，是每一个人的口号。但是，“跑在洪水前面”不是容易的事。子堤加高一条麻袋，全线便是五十万条。特别是洪水位突破二九公尺的时候，一分一秒钟的时间都是宝贵的。一等功臣陈国学，为了每次多担一些土，赢得时间，几天里压断了两条扁担，累病了，还坚持上堤防去工作；二等功臣童海银看到滔滔的洪水眼看要涨出堤，为了争取时间，经常用两条扁担一次挑两担飞跑，荣军学校的校长是三等残废，伤又在脚上，仍坚持着不肯休息。妇女王香余，六十多岁了，满头白发，而且一条臂膀残废，也自动参加了挑土的队伍。打夯的工人们，为了赢得时间，从一分钟三十下的速度，加速到一分钟五十下、六十下。就这样，他们把“水涨堤高”的神话变成了现实。有许多工段，刚刚完成了加高工程，汹涌的洪峰就接踵而至。
    三个多月的抢险斗争，是万分紧张的工作。由于高水位浸淹的时间过久，几乎每一天，每一个工段，都有大大小小的险情。“千里堤防，溃于蚁穴。”任何一个工段，任何一个时刻，任何一个巡逻队稍一疏忽，整个堤防就不可收拾。巡逻队的队员们，像母亲护理病中的婴儿一样，不分日夜地守候着、观察着，从堤上到堤下，从外坡到内坡，一寸土地也不肯放松。黑夜里，灯被风吹熄了，就用耳朵从水声中来听；在分不清是雨水还是浸漏的地方，就跳下去用脚试水的寒暖来辨别。巡逻战士张云昌夜里巡查险情，跪在堤上，一寸寸地膝行着，把手探伸到水里仔细地摸。他的裤子被磨破了，膝盖被磨得出了血，他一点也不知道。解放军战士何友瑚、邓官生、李彦林等，为了寻查险情，用绳子系着，坠在淹到脖子的深水里，一夜寻找到裂缝一百多处。有一次堤底的臭泥塘里发现大管漏现象，巡逻战士连新衣服也没顾得脱就跳下去，在臭水污泥中坚持了好几个钟头，终于及时消灭了隐患。当发生重大险情的鸣锣声响起的时候，抢险队员就像白刃冲锋的战士一样投入战斗。当舵落口正街发现堤下阴沟破裂，洪水汹涌流入的时候，十八岁的女青年韩友梅不顾水流湍急，毫不犹豫地跳下水去；七月二十九夜晚张公堤某段发生险情的时候，战士罗光田就不顾一切，用自己的身体堵住漏洞。不朽的烈士贾明武同志，是千千万万这样无畏战士的典范。他在抢救一个大险工后从水里出来的时候，本来已经筋疲力尽；但他发现了另一个险工，就忘记
  一切抱着麻袋又跳下水去，为这个英雄城市贡献出他宝贵的生命。
      “大禹治水，三过家门而不入”，传为千古美谈。今天，毛泽东的优秀儿女们，普遍地继承了我们祖先的这种高贵的品质。合作乡的女乡长袁秀珍，领着全乡几百农民在堤上和洪水战斗。她自己的家，被渍水淹没了；虽然近在咫尺，她自己连一次也没有回去看过。她说：“堤防是一百五十万人的大命根子，大命根子要紧。”三十年的老木排工万仁和家被渍水淹了，捎信让他回去，他说：“家里后方有人管，离了我能行，前边可不能离开我。人人要是都先顾自己的家，谁的家也保不住。”他不论日夜地工作着，把经验和智慧全部投到防浪斗争上，把大批的废铁锚改造成有用的铁锚。正因为有成千成百的万仁和这样的战士，他们发挥了集体的力量，创造了长达九十多华里的防浪木排——保护堤身最有力的“水上长城”。
    排水工程，同样是一个奇迹，三百多架抽水机，像几十条青龙一样，把岱家山下一片汪洋的积水，抽上高坡，倾入长江；三个月中，排出的积水达
  一亿零八百八十八万多立方公尺。据一个老工程师说，如果在旧社会，这三百多架抽水机，从工程设计到安装，至少得六个月到八个月。但是，今天，在全体技工、电工、搬运工的集体努力下，他们只用了八天时间便完全竣工。在工作中，他们发挥了惊人的坚韧性和创造力。为了清除吸水管“莲蓬头”的杂草，技工狄尚德不顾天冷水寒，冒着大雨，跳在水里工作，坚持了十六个小时之久。他们终于实现了“让渍水滚进长江，让农民弟兄早日回返家园”的口号。
    在八月中旬洪水涨到最高峰（二九·七三公尺）的时候，铁路的运输被洪水切断了。当时的情势是千钧一发。为了支援堤防前线的土方石块和防汛器材，勇敢的铁道工人们一次再次地抬高路轨，抬高了六次；后来，水越涨越大，没有办法再抬高路轨，工人刘善裕等就冒着生命的危险，创造了火车在水中行驶的千古奇迹，终于把千万吨的黄土石块运上堤防。
    在一百多公里的长堤上，可泣可歌的事迹，普通人民群众中的英雄，像满天的繁星一样，是数也数不尽的。武汉人民将永远不会忘记，有一百○八位烈士，为这英雄的城市献出了他们宝贵的生命。
    全市的每一个工厂，郊区的每一个农村，街道居民、青年学生，机关干部……源源不断地支援着前方。第五发电厂在汉正街的大堤外面，工人们一面和洪水“独立作战”，一面保证着工业用电和照明用电，并把电力送到张公堤上。自来水厂的工人们，在准备“万一”的情况加高了水管，保证在任何情况下人民都能喝到干净的自来水。街道的妇女，成百成千的投入防汛服务队，把成万挑的茶水挑到堤上；天冷下雨，就送姜糖水，天晴炎热，就送甘草菊花茶。无数妇女在替防汛战士补衣服的时候剪短了自己的袖子，把自己爱人的钮扣拆下来钉在防汛战士的缺少钮扣的衣服上。汉正街发生大管漏洪水涌入的时候，不少妇女抱出自己床上的棉被，脱下自己的衣服填到漏洞里。堤防前线防浪木排上需用大量的铁锚；十八岁的船工女儿聂秀珍知道汉水沿岸涨水时有些铁锚淹在水里，就和几个年纪差不多的女伴，驾着渔船去打捞，冒着风雨，在汉水沿岸的急流里坚持了四个昼夜。在八月初险情最多的时候，每一条街道上都掀起热火朝天的捐献废砖废石的运动。码头工人家属舒香老大娘，已经六十多岁了，除了每天洗衣送水以外，还携着十来岁的小孙孙踏着烂泥在池塘边捡石头，一天捡到二百多斤。江岸区一位姓高的老大爷，激动地说：
  “今年的大水是百年没有的大水，现在的政府是千年不遇的政府。我要多活几年，好好看看。”说着，就把儿子为他准备立碑的石材也献出来。许多老太太自动地把几十年垫箱柜的砖都搬了出来，亲自往车上装。就这样，成吨的砖石从每一条街道飞奔出来，及时解决了前方抢险的急需。
    后方人民，像对待自己的亲人一样，照料着防汛战士的家属和被灾难民的家属。许多机关的大礼堂，几乎全部学校的教室，都成为灾民的招待所。宝庆街的街道妇女潘小锁，一九三一年大水灾的时候，她的两个儿子都在水灾里死掉了。当时四面是水，连埋葬儿子死尸的地方也没有，只好放在房顶让风吹日晒。如今，她是街道的妇女委员。她日夜奔走着，把六七十个防汛家属和灾民的孕妇都送到妇婴保健所。她一个人就替防汛工人洗了一千多件衣服。她咬着牙说：“过去的日子无论如何也不能让它再回来！”她的声音，也正是全市居民的声音。
    大学中学的学生们，在斗争一开始就奋勇地投
  入斗争。男生们参加了挖土挑土的工作，女孩子们成群结队参加了堤上的服务队。他们很快地和工农兵弟兄联结在一起，成为亲密的弟兄姊妹。服务队的女孩子们，替防汛的战士们做“垫肩”，做“手掌”，洗补衣服，写家信和立功计划……。有人曾经统计过，说她们的工作有六十七种；实际上，她们是有什么事就做什么事。在暴风雨的天气里，她们不愿让湖水的腥味沾上工人的衣服，就用绳子系着腰在江水里洗；为补战士们的衣服，许多人的长袖变成短袖。她们上午还在代表后方人民歌唱“光荣的防汛大军”，下午却又代表前方的战士招待后方的人民代表；以致前后方评功的时候很难决定她们究竟是属于前方或者后方。而这正代表她们的特色，她们把前后方人民的情感融合成为一片。
    贸易服务队、合作社服务队的队员们，出色地完成了供应前方的工作。他们在堤上搭起售货棚，推着流动货车、细致耐心地把吃的、穿的、用的送到每一个工地，每一个工棚。贸易公司从来没有卖过油条；但战士们需要，他们就卖油条；合作社从来不卖生鸡蛋，但战士们需要，他们就卖生鸡蛋。为了怕把食品淋湿，下大雨的时候流动货车的服务员们，就自己光着膀子，把衣服盖在货车上，面包一时供应不上，他们就在堤边架起火来烤制。他们把一百多里的长堤和许多没人烟的荒山，变为热闹的市场。
  一批批的文化大军，川流不息地开上前线，整个的子堤，被装饰成五色缤纷的大墙报。全市知名的各种剧种的演员，三番五次冒着大雨上堤演出。在发生险情的时候，有些演员脸上还带着油彩，就和工人们一道投入抢险的工作。
    像这样的事例，是写不完说不尽的。后方千万条血管都在为前方输血，支援着堤防前线；更加上中央和全国各地人民的支援，这力量就更加声势浩大，给堤防前线以巨大的支援。三江的洪水虽然凶猛，最后不得不屈服在人民面前。
    现在，长江已驯驯顺顺地蜷伏在人民的脚下。二十万防汛大军，正高擎着胜利的红旗，离开前线，穿过大街，奔回各自的岗位。基本建设工地上，又开始沸腾起来；岱家山下的农民，成群结队牵着牛重返家园，在积水排干的土地上又种上菜蔬；解放军擦干刺刀上的泥土，等待着解放台湾的进军号令；学校已经开学，老师和学生们都添了一课新的生动的社会主义教材。三个月的紧张斗争，不仅保卫了武汉这座重要城市，更可贵的是更进一步锻炼了武汉人民。防汛大军中数以千计的优秀人物，光荣地参加了共产党和青年团。每一个为防洪斗争流过汗忧过心的人，都更懂得热爱祖国，热爱武汉，热爱自己的工作。武汉人民有决心也有信心，把武汉建设成为一个美丽的社会主义工业化的城市。
