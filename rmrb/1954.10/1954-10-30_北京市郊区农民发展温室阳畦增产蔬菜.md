Suburban Beijing Farmers Develop Greenhouses and Sunken Greenhouses to Increase Vegetable Production

This winter, the output of greenhouse and sunken greenhouse vegetables in the suburbs of Beijing will increase by one-third compared to last year. Currently, most of the greenhouse vegetable seedlings have been transplanted, and in some areas, the first batch of greenhouse cucumbers will be available on the market in just over twenty days. The work of raising seedlings in sunken greenhouses has been mostly completed.

This year, the number of greenhouses in the suburbs has increased from more than 4,600 last year to more than 7,700, and the number of sunken greenhouses has increased from more than 30,000 last year to more than 48,000. The Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative in Haidian District, led by the famous greenhouse production expert Li Molin, has increased its greenhouses by more than 400 and its sunken greenhouses by more than 300 compared to last year. This year, the cooperative's greenhouse vegetable production alone will increase from more than 30,000 jin last year to 116,000 jin.

    北京市郊区农民发展温室阳畦增产蔬菜
    今年冬季，北京市郊温室、阳畦蔬菜产量将比去年增加三分之一。目前温室菜苗大部定植，有些地区第一茬温室黄瓜二十多天后就可上市。阳畦育苗工作已大多完成。
    今年郊区温室由去年的四千六百多间发展到七千七百多间，阳畦由去年的三万多畦发展到四万八千多畦。著名的温室生产能手李墨林领导的海淀区四季青蔬菜生产合作社温室比去年增加四百多间、阳畦增加三百多畦。全社今年仅温室蔬菜产量就将由去年的三万多斤增加到十一万六千斤。
