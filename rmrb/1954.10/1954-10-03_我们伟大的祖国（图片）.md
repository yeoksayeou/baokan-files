    Our Great Motherland
    Over the past five years, farmers in the nation's cotton-producing areas have worked hard to increase cotton production, support national economic construction, and supply the people's needs. Farmers in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, planted 410,000 mu of cotton this year, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. The "Peace" agricultural production cooperative in Xiwai Village in the county can produce an average of 260 jin of seed cotton per mu. This is a picture of members of the cooperative picking cotton.
