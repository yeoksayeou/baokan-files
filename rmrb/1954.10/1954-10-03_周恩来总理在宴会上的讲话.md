Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet

Dear Guests, Comrades, and Friends:

    As the Chinese people celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government delegation and the government delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the German Democractic Republic, the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, at the invitation of our government, have traveled a long distance to our capital to participate in our National Day celebrations. We are deeply honored. On behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, I extend a heartfelt welcome and sincere gratitude to our distinguished guests.

    Over the past five years, the Chinese people have made many achievements in building their motherland and defending world peace. These achievements are inseparable from the support of all international friends and the growing strength of the world's peace forces.

    The fraternal alliance between the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has laid a solid foundation for comprehensive cooperation in politics, economy, and culture between our two countries. Our alliance is demonstrating an increasing influence in safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. The sincere, enormous, and long-term assistance given to our country by the Soviet government and people is of great significance in accelerating China's socialist industrialization. The solidarity and mutual assistance between our country and the various people's democratic countries are also important factors enabling our country to achieve many successes.

    In carrying out our various undertakings, our country also attaches great importance to peaceful cooperation between our country and Southeast Asian countries and other countries willing to coexist peacefully, as well as the concern and support of peace-loving people all over the world.

    Today, the Chinese people are advancing along the road of building a socialist society. Your presence is a great encouragement to the Chinese people. It indicates that in the course of the Chinese people's struggle to build socialism, they will continue to receive further concern and support from the great Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and progressive humanity around the world.

    Your presence also shows that the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the hundreds of millions of great Soviet people, the people of the people's democratic countries, and the Chinese people will be further consolidated and developed for the glorious cause of world peace and human progress. This close friendship and unity is an invincible and strong guarantee for the world's peace and democratic forces.

    Dear Comrades and Friends! Let us unite, full of confidence, and march toward the victory of the cause of peace!

    Please allow me to propose a toast to the solidarity and cooperation of the peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, to peace in the Far East and the world, and to the health of all distinguished guests!
