    Sichuan Province Holds Symposium on Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine

    The Health Department of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government and the Health Bureau of the Chengdu Municipal People's Government jointly convened a symposium of traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in Sichuan Province and Chengdu City from the 24th to the 26th. The symposium discussed issues such as systematically developing the work of traditional Chinese medicine, further strengthening the unity of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, jointly studying Chinese medicine, and promoting the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. More than 70 well-known traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors and responsible cadres from health administrative departments across the province participated in the symposium. The symposium fully demonstrated the spirit of unity and cooperation, and mutual learning. Attendees all recognized the great significance of unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in jointly studying and researching the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. Many responsible cadres from health administrative departments and Western medicine doctors criticized the bourgeois sectarianism of the past that looked down on traditional Chinese medicine; they respectfully referred to traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as "senior experts" and sincerely expressed their desire to humbly learn from them, closely unite with them, and jointly explore the treasure of traditional Chinese medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners deeply appreciated the concern of the Party and the government for the work of traditional Chinese medicine and recognized the bright future of their work; they criticized the shortcomings of health administrative departments and Western medicine doctors in their past treatment of traditional Chinese medicine and also examined their own erroneous thinking, expressing that they themselves must also learn modern scientific knowledge with a humble attitude and jointly conduct systematic research and consolidation of the medical legacy of the motherland with Western medicine doctors.

    At the meeting, the Health Department of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government and the Health Bureau of the Chengdu Municipal People's Government studied the opinions provided by the attendees and the actual situation of the province and proposed specific measures for carrying out traditional Chinese medicine work in the future: preparing to conduct a study on policies related to traditional Chinese medicine work among health institutions at all levels and all health workers in the province; and designating the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital and the Affiliated Hospital of Sichuan Medical College to focus on increasing traditional Chinese medicine services and organizing a certain number of Western medicine doctors to study Chinese medicine; adding traditional Chinese medicine courses to secondary medical schools throughout the province and strengthening the correspondence work of traditional Chinese medicine refresher schools; calling on and assisting the Chongqing and Chengdu branches of the Chinese Medical Association and the Sichuan Provincial Health Workers Association to systematically exchange traditional Chinese and Western medical knowledge, especially traditional Chinese medical knowledge and experience. The Chengdu Municipal Health Bureau also plans to add a traditional Chinese medicine department, add or enrich traditional Chinese medicine services in most of its affiliated medical institutions; strengthen the leadership of joint traditional Chinese and Western medicine clinics; and establish a traditional Chinese and Western medicine academic research committee as the leading core for the city's research on Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical science.
