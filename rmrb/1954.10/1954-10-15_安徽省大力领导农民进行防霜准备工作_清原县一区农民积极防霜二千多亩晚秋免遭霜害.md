    Anhui Province Vigorously Leads Farmers in Frost Prevention Preparations
    Farmers in the First District of Qingyuan County Actively Prevent Frost, Saving More Than 2,000 Mu of Late Autumn Crops from Frost Damage

    Party and government organizations at all levels in Anhui Province are vigorously leading farmers in frost prevention preparations. In twelve counties, including Huaining, Taihu, and Tongcheng, more than 2,400 cadres have been organized to go to the countryside to mobilize the masses to prepare for frost prevention. Frost prevention intelligence organizations have been established in various places, and a large number of frost prevention materials have been prepared. Currently, in areas with water sources, farmers are irrigating rice paddies and buckwheat fields to keep them warm. Farmers in areas without water sources are actively using methods such as covering with grass, hilling roots, and earthing up to prevent frost. In Taihu County's Huangzheng District, 2,100 people were mobilized in three days and nights to cover more than 7,000 mu of crops such as buckwheat and sweet potatoes with rice straw. In Zhangji Township, Yuji District, Funan County, more than 2,200 piles of firewood for smoke fumigation have also been prepared on the edges of the fields. Farmers are actively harvesting mature late autumn crops in various places. In one night, eight townships in Tongcheng's Fangang District harvested more than 100 mu of late rice and also carried out irrigation and frost prevention work in more than 280 mu of buckwheat fields.

    On September 25, after receiving an urgent frost prevention instruction from the county, the First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Qingyuan County, Liaoning Province, sent all district cadres to key frost prevention villages and settlements overnight to mobilize the masses to use firewood, artemisia, and green grass to create smoke for frost prevention. That night, more than 2,000 smoke fires were lit in twenty villages for frost prevention. Although the frost was severe on the nights of the 25th and 26th, thanks to the active protection of the masses, more than 2,200 mu of late-maturing crops in the district were protected from frost damage, and it is estimated that more than 90,000 jin of grain losses were avoided.

    安徽省大力领导农民进行防霜准备工作
    清原县一区农民积极防霜二千多亩晚秋免遭霜害
    安徽省各级党政组织，大力领导农民进行防霜准备工作。怀宁、太湖、桐城等十二县，共组织了二千四百多名干部，下乡发动群众准备防霜，各地还建立了防霜情报组织，并准备了大批防霜器材。目前，有水源的地方，农民正向稻田和荞麦田灌水保温；无水源地方的农民积极用盖草、壅根、培土等办法防霜，太湖县黄政区在三日一夜就发动了二千一百多群众，用稻草盖好荞麦、红芋等庄稼七千余亩，阜南县于集区张集乡还在地头上准备好了熏烟防霜柴草二千二百多堆。各地已成熟的晚秋作物，农民正在积极抢收。桐城范岗区八个乡一夜就抢收了一百多亩晚稻，还在二百八十多亩荞麦田里做了灌水防霜工作。
    九月二十五日，中共辽宁省清原县第一区区委会接到县里防霜紧急指示后，全区干部星夜奔赴各重点防霜村、屯，发动群众用烧柴、青蒿、青草等熏烟防霜。当天夜晚，就有二十个村点起了两千多堆熏烟火堆防霜。二十五、二十六日两夜虽然降霜严重，但由于群众积极防护，全区二千二百多亩晚熟作物减免了霜害的侵袭，估计约避免了九万多斤粮食的损失。（韩文洲）
