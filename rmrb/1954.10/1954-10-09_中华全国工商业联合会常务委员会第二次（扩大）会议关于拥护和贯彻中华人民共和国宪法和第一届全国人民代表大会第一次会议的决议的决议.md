    The Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce warmly celebrates the great achievements of the First Session of the First National People's Congress. It unanimously expresses its heartfelt support for the formulation and promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, for Chairman Mao's opening speech and all the resolutions of the meeting, and for the election of the state leading staff headed by Chairman Mao. We unanimously recognize that the transition from a new democratic society to a socialist society is the only correct path our country should take; this path must be taken, and there is no other path to take; under the leadership of the working class, the national bourgeoisie, following this correct path forward, can still play an important role in the national economy during the transition period, can still make certain contributions to the country, and also have a certain position politically. We in the industrial and commercial circles resolutely respond to all the calls of the National People's Congress and Chairman Mao, unite closely with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, resolutely take the socialist road, and strive to build a great socialist country, and strive to defend international peace and develop the cause of human progress. To this end, the following resolutions are unanimously adopted:

    1. We in the industrial and commercial circles must extensively and deeply study the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao's opening speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution, and Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report. We must profoundly understand the spirit and essence of our country's constitution and these important reports, use them as a guide for our actions and as a basis for our ideological remolding, launch criticism and self-criticism, completely break away from the influence of internal and external reactionaries, further enhance our patriotic ideology, and wholeheartedly strive to implement the constitution and for the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland.

    2. Obeying the constitution and laws is an obligation that every citizen must fulfill without exception. We in the industrial and commercial circles should strengthen our concept of patriotism and law-abidingness and enhance our sense of solemn responsibility to our great motherland. We must be vigilant at all times and prevent ourselves from using private property to endanger public interests, disrupt social economic order, and undermine national economic plans. Taking patriotism and law-abidingness as the most basic condition for accepting socialist transformation, we must faithfully fulfill our responsibilities and obligations to the country and society, and under the leadership of the government, resolutely struggle against any behavior that violates the interests of the country and the people.

    3. Carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is an important part of the general task of our country's transition period. We in the industrial and commercial circles must actively accept socialist transformation, accept the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses. We must actively operate, overcome all difficulties, actively improve business management, and under the leadership of the government, gradually transform enterprises into various forms of state capitalist economy. Enterprises that have not been incorporated into state capitalism should actively create conditions to prepare for embarking on state capitalism. At the same time, we must consciously and voluntarily work hard to learn, strive to learn new ideas and new things, overcome old habits and old styles, so as to closely combine enterprise transformation and personal transformation, so that enterprises and individuals can play an active and beneficial role in socialist transformation and national economic construction, and so that they can have a bright future.

    4. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the sacred responsibility of the people of the whole country. We in the industrial and commercial circles must contribute our strength to respond to and implement the resolution of the Central People's Government Committee and the call issued in the joint declaration of the democratic parties and people's organizations, and fight to the end to support the liberation of Taiwan.

    The achievements of the First Session of the First National People's Congress are great, and the tasks entrusted to us are arduous. Trade and industry associations at all levels should strengthen the unity of private industrialists and businessmen, vigorously cultivate more progressive backbones, and actively play a leading role and a bridging role; they should strengthen propaganda and education work; strengthen investigation and research and specific business guidance work; correctly use trade associations and all organizational forces that can be used, and under the local party and government leadership, actively guide industrialists and businessmen to advance towards socialist society along the road prescribed by the constitution.

    中华全国工商业联合会常务委员会第二次（扩大）会议
    关于拥护和贯彻中华人民共和国宪法和第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的决议的决议
    中华全国工商业联合会常务委员会第二次（扩大）会议热烈庆祝第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的伟大成就，对于中华人民共和国宪法的制定和颁布，对于毛主席的开幕词及会议的一切决议，对于选出以毛主席为首的国家领导工作人员，一致表示衷心的拥护。我们一致认识到：由新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会，是我国应当走的唯一正确的道路；这条道路必须走，而且不能不走，此外别无其他道路可走；民族资产阶级在工人阶级领导下，遵循着这条正确的道路前进，在国家过渡时期，对国民经济还可以起重要的作用，对国家还可以作出一定的贡献，而且在政治上也有一定的地位。我们工商界坚决响应全国人民代表大会和毛主席的一切号召，在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，和全国人民紧密地团结在一起，坚决走社会主义道路，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗，为了保卫国际和平和发展人类进步事业而奋斗。为此，一致决议如下：
    一、我们工商界必须广泛地、深入地学习中华人民共和国宪法、毛主席的开幕词、刘少奇委员长关于宪法草案的报告和周恩来总理的政府工作报告。要深刻地体会我们国家的宪法和这些重要报告的精神和实质，作为我们行动的指针，作为我们思想改造的依据，展开批评与自我批评，使自己完全脱离内外反动派的影响，进一步提高爱国主义思想，全心全意为贯彻宪法的执行、为祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造而奋斗。
    二、遵守宪法和法律是每一个公民无例外地必须履行的义务。我们工商界更应该加强爱国守法观念，提高自己对于我们伟大祖国的庄严的责任感。必须随时警惕并防止自己利用私有财产危害公共利益，扰乱社会经济秩序和破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为的发生，以爱国守法作为自己接受社会主义改造的最起码的条件；必须忠诚地履行自己对国家对社会的责任和义务，并在政府领导下，与任何违反国家和人民利益的行为作坚决的斗争。
    三、对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，是我国过渡时期总任务的一个重要组成部分。我们工商界必须积极接受社会主义改造，必须接受国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，积极经营，克服一切困难，积极改善经营管理，在政府的领导下，逐步把企业改变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济。未纳入国家资本主义的企业，应积极创造条件，为走上国家资本主义作好准备。同时，必须自觉自愿地努力学习，努力学习新思想新事物，克服旧习惯旧作风，以改造自己，使企业改造和个人改造密切结合起来，使企业和个人在社会主义改造和国家经济建设中发挥积极有益的作用，使自己获得光明的前途。
    四、解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是全国人民的神圣责任。我们工商界必须贡献自己的力量来响应和贯彻中央人民政府委员会的决议和各民主党派各人民团体联合宣言中所发出的号召，为支援解放台湾而奋斗到底。
    第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的成就是伟大的，交给我们的任务是艰巨的。各级工商业联合会应该加强团结私营工商业者，大力培养更多的进步骨干，积极发挥带头作用和桥梁作用；应该加强宣传教育工作；加强调查研究和具体的业务辅导工作；正确运用同业公会和一切能够运用的组织力量，在当地党政领导下，积极地引导工商业者按照宪法所规定的道路，向着社会主义社会前进。
                   一九五四年十月四日
