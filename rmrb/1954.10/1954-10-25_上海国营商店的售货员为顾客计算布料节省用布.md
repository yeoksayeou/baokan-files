Shanghai State-owned store salespeople calculate fabric savings for customers

    Recently, salespeople in 23 state-owned retail cotton fabric stores in Shanghai have learned various clothing cutting methods. Salespeople help customers accurately calculate how much fabric is needed based on the customer's different body types and the style of clothing being made.

    Since the beginning of this year, the State-owned Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company and department stores have successively held cutting business training classes, inviting experienced tailors to teach more than 200 cotton fabric salespeople the specifications, varieties, and shrinkage rates of various cotton fabrics. They also compiled teaching materials, categorizing various clothes that people commonly wear and calculating material dimensions according to different ages and body types. Salespeople who participated in the training have now mastered the cutting principles of dozens of types of clothing and fabric-saving cutting methods. According to the experience gained, each sale of fabric for a single layer of clothing can generally save five inches compared to the past, and a cotton-padded coat can save two to three feet.

    上海国营商店的售货员为顾客计算布料节省用布
    上海市二十三家零售棉布的国营商店售货员，最近学会了各种服装的裁剪方法。售货员根据顾客不同的身材和缝制服装的式样，帮助顾客正确地计算需用多少布料。
    今年以来，国营花纱布公司和百货公司先后举办了裁剪业务训练班，邀请富有经验的裁剪师，向参加学习的二百多名棉布售货员讲授各种棉布的规格、品种、缩水度等，并编了教材，把人们常穿的各种衣服分门别类，按照不同的年龄、身材计算用料尺寸。参加学习的售货员现在已懂得了数十种服装裁剪原理和节约布料的剪裁方法。根据已取得的经验，每出售一套单衣的布料，一般可比过去节省五寸，一件棉大衣，可节省二、三尺。　（新华社）
