Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The British Conservative Party held its 74th annual conference in Blackpool on the 7th. Attending the meeting were 4,100 representatives from local party organizations.
    The various local party organizations submitted 252 proposals to the conference concerning domestic and foreign policy issues. However, as in the past, the meeting will only discuss those proposals that will not create difficulties for the Conservative Party leadership; the Conservative Party leadership only selected fourteen proposals for discussion.
    Among the proposals not to be discussed was one submitted by the Conservative Party's Yardley (Warwickshire) organization, which called for "new contact with Russia at a high level." A "Reynolds News" reporter pointed out that this proposal "may greatly embarrass Eden, who is trying to make people forget that Churchill also made such a proposal about a year and a half ago."
    When discussing foreign policy issues, Eden spoke on issues such as Indochina, Iran, Egypt, Trieste, and Germany.
    Eden particularly emphasized the German question. According to the full text of Eden's speech issued by Reuters, in order to prevent Germany from breaking away from the West, Eden advocated abandoning the "discriminatory policy" against Germany, and "not turning our backs on Germany." Eden believes that the London Conference's decision on arming West Germany and bringing West Germany into the Western military bloc is the most favorable policy towards Germany for Britain. However, as everyone knows, this policy only serves the interests of West German militarists and revanchists, and does not serve the interests of the German people.
    Eden said: If the parliaments of Western European countries reject the London Agreement, the consequences would be "unthinkable." He emphasized that, apart from incorporating West Germany into the North Atlantic Group and the Brussels Group, "there is no other way to establish a system that can include Germany." Eden threatened that, without this, the United States "would have an excuse to seek other ways of self-preservation."
    Eden did not dare to completely avoid the suggestions on the German question made by Molotov in his speech in Berlin on October 6. However, he evaded the essence of this suggestion, which advocated a fundamental solution to the German question. Eden falsely claimed that the Soviet Union's purpose in making this suggestion was to give "the German Communist Party the power to rule the whole country."
    At the morning session on the 7th, two resolutions were passed, giving the government the right to act freely in foreign policy.
    The afternoon session on the 7th debated trade between Commonwealth countries and world trade. This debate clearly reflected the concerns of British capitalists that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) created by the United States would have a fatal impact on imperial trade. The debate focused on a proposal that required the government to revise GATT when necessary to maintain the "traditional trade" ties between Commonwealth countries. Member of Parliament V. Raikes proposed an amendment to this proposal, calling for "revising GATT to regain freedom of action in terms of imperial preference." Former Secretary of State for India, L. Amery, and a considerable number of representatives supported this amendment, but Trade Minister Thorneycroft requested the annual conference to reject the amendment and pass the original proposal. He said that if Britain opposed this agreement at the upcoming meeting of GATT member states, it would not get the support of the Commonwealth countries. Thorneycroft's speech illustrated the profound influence and pressure that the United States has on the member states of the Commonwealth. As a result, the annual conference passed the original proposal and rejected the amendment.
    The meeting on the 8th discussed financial and economic policy issues. The annual conference passed a resolution in favor of the government's financial and economic policies. In order to win votes for the Conservative Party in the next parliamentary election, the resolution also pretended to call for reducing the "heavy burden of taxation." However, Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler's speech at the end of the debate showed that if the government's military spending is maintained at its current level, tax cuts are unlikely.
    Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech at the closing meeting. He boasted that his government had restored Britain's ability to pay. He said: "We are now once again living within our means without borrowing." He said that in order to improve Britain's economic situation, Britain "needs a breather." He said he cherished "the hope of peaceful coexistence with Russia" and that he "will take an unwavering stance in this regard." However, Churchill emphasized that Britain's policy is so-called "peace through strength," and the "peaceful coexistence" in his mind does not mean changing the policy of arms expansion and war preparation that has brought such great disasters to the British people. Therefore, he even described the recent agreement reached at the London Nine-Power Conference on the revival of German militarism as "very likely to become a monument and milestone for our move towards peaceful coexistence." Churchill spent a lot of words to slander the Soviet Union and flattered the United States. He openly rebuked the calls in British public opinion for getting rid of American influence and tried his best to advocate maintaining the war alliance with the United States. Churchill expressed his gratitude for the "help and protection" of the United States. He even said that "an increasingly close relationship with the United States is the most important factor in our journey forward."

### 英国保守党举行第七十四届年会

    英国保守党举行第七十四届年会
    据新华社讯：英国保守党第七十四届年会七日在布拉克浦开幕，出席会议的有四千一百个地方党组织的代表。
    各地方党组织向大会提出了二百五十二项有关对内、对外政策问题的提案。但是，和以往一样，会议将只讨论那些不会使保守党领导机构棘手的提案，保守党领导只挑出了十四个提案进行讨论。
    在那些不讨论的提案中，有一个是保守党雅德莱（沃里克夏尔）地方组织提出的提案，这个提案要求“在高级水平上和俄国进行新的接触”。“雷诺新闻”的记者指出，这一提案“可能使艾登十分为难，艾登企图使人忘掉，约一年半前邱吉尔也提出过这样的建议”。
    在讨论外交政策问题时，艾登发言谈到印度支那、伊朗、埃及、的里雅斯特和德国等问题。
    艾登特别着重谈到德国问题。根据路透社播发的艾登发言全文来看，为了不让德国脱离西方，艾登主张放弃对德国采取的“歧视政策”，“不要用背向着德国”。艾登认为，伦敦会议关于武装西德和把西德拉入西方国家的军事集团的决定，对英国说来是最有利的对德政策。但是，大家知道，这种政策只符合于西德军国主义和复仇主义分子的利益，决不符合德国人民的利益。
    艾登说：如果西欧各国的议会拒绝伦敦协议，其后果是“不堪设想的”。他强调指出，除了把西德吸收入北大西洋集团和布鲁塞尔集团外，“再也没有任何可能来建立一个能把德国包括进去的体系了”。艾登威胁说，不这样，美国“就有了借口寻找其他自救的出路”。
    艾登不敢完全回避莫洛托夫十月六日在柏林演说时提出的关于德国问题的建议。但是他回避了这一建议主张根本解决德国问题的实质。艾登胡说，苏联提出这一建议的目的是要给“德国共产党统治全国的权力”。
    七日上午会议上通过了两项决议，给予政府在对外政策方面有自由行动的权利。
    七日下午会议辩论了英联邦各国之间的贸易和世界贸易问题。这次辩论明显地反映了英国资本家担心美国所制造的关税及贸易总协定对帝国贸易有致命的影响。辩论集中在一个提案上，这个提案要求政府必要时可以修订关税及贸易总协定，以保持英联邦各国间“传统的贸易”联系。议员维·瑞克斯对这个提案提出了一个修正案，要求“修订关税及贸易总协定，以便在帝国优惠制方面可以重新有行动的自由”。前印度事务大臣利·埃麦里以及相当多的代表都赞成这个修正案，但是贸易大臣桑尼克罗夫特要求年会否决修正案，而通过原提案。他说，英国如果在快要举行的关税及贸易总协定成员国会议上反对这个协定，那就会得不到英联邦各国的支持。桑尼克罗夫特的发言说明了美国对英联邦各成员国有如何深刻的影响和压力。结果，年会通过了原先的提案，而否决了修正案。
    八日会议讨论了财政经济政策问题。年会通过了一个决议，赞成政府的财政、经济政策。为了要为保守党博得在下届议会选举中的选票，决议又假意要求减轻“赋税的沉重负担”。但是，财政大臣巴特勒在辩论结束时的发言却表明：政府的扩军费用保持现有水平，减税就很少可能。
    首相邱吉尔在闭幕会议上发表演说。他吹嘘他的政府已经恢复了英国的支付能力。他说：“我们现在又再度不靠借债过日子了”。他说为了改善英国的经济情况，英国“需要一个喘息时期”。他说他怀着“同俄国和平共处的希望”，并且说他“将在这方面采取坚定不移的态度”。但是邱吉尔强调说明英国的政策是所谓“以实力求和平”，而他心目中的“和平共处”并不意味着要改变已经给英国人民带来如此重大灾害的扩军备战政策。因此，他竟然把伦敦九国会议最近就复活德国军国主义所达成的协议说成是“很可能成为我们走向和平共处的纪念碑和里程碑”。邱吉尔化费了大量言辞来对苏联大肆诽谤，而对美国则竭力谄媚。他公开斥责英国舆论界要求摆脱美国影响的呼声而竭力鼓吹保持和美国的战争联盟。邱吉尔表示感谢美国的“帮助和保护”。他甚至说“和美国越来越密切的联系是我们前途中最重大的因素”。
