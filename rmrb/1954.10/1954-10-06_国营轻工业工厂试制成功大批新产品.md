State-owned light industrial factories have successfully trial-produced a large number of new products.

Since the beginning of this year, factories under the Ministry of Light Industry, such as rubber, paper, and pharmaceutical factories, the Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute, and some local state-owned paper mills, have successfully trial-produced a large number of new products to meet the needs of national construction and people's lives.

The new products successfully trial-produced by state-owned rubber factories include two types of large-sized automobile tires and hydrogen balloons. The large-sized tires were trial-produced to meet the needs of trucks and large automobiles transporting crude oil and will be officially put into production in October. In the past, hydrogen balloons were completely dependent on imports. In order to fully meet the needs of meteorological observation departments, domestic production has now begun on a large scale. In addition, more than 80 kinds of rubber products for automobile assembly and carriage tires for horse-drawn carts are being trial-produced or are being prepared for trial production.

The state-owned Shenyang Paper Mill Copper Mesh Factory successfully trial-produced 200-mesh precision copper mesh in May of this year. This kind of copper mesh is used for filtering machine oil in machinery and chemical industries. There are 40,000 small holes per square inch of this copper mesh, and the copper wire is half as thin as a human hair. In the past, it was always dependent on imports, but now domestic production has begun. The local state-owned Mudanjiang Paper Mill has also successfully trial-produced industrial steel paper and began production in June. This product has the characteristics of anti-expansion, insulation, oil resistance, and flame resistance. It is suitable for oil tanks, ignition tubes, and cylinder gaskets in the transportation industry, as well as insulating materials in the electrical industry, spindles and bearings in the textile industry, and safety helmets for miners and protective masks for welders.

The Aureomycin trial-produced by the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory has been successful and has begun production. Aureomycin is a valuable medicine for treating peritonitis, paratyphoid, typhus, trachoma, and other diseases, and can also treat mixed-infection pneumonia that penicillin cannot cure. The Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute has successfully researched and developed the manufacturing of calcium gluconate by fermentation. This medicine is for chronic patients, pregnant women, and children who lack calcium; it is also the main raw material for sodium stibogluconate (an effective drug for treating schistosomiasis). In the past, the cost of manufacturing calcium gluconate by electrolysis in China was very high, and it could not be produced on a large scale, so it needed to be imported from foreign countries; now, using fermentation to manufacture calcium gluconate is low in cost, excellent in quality, and suitable for large-scale production. The state-owned Qiqihar Medical Device Factory learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and successfully trial-produced a square high-pressure sterilization cabinet in May of this year. This product is being manufactured for the first time in China. Its parts are very precise, and the sterilization power reaches six atmospheres.

    国营轻工业工厂试制成功大批新产品
    中央轻工业部所属橡胶、造纸、医药等厂，上海工业试验所及部分地方国营纸厂，今年以来已试制成功大批新产品，供给国家建设及人民生活需要。
    国营橡胶厂试制成功的新产品有两种大规格汽车轮胎和氢气球等。大规格轮胎是为了供应运输原油的卡车及大型汽车的需要而试制的，将于十月份正式生产。氢气球过去完全依赖进口，为了充分供应气象测候部门需要，现国内已开始大量生产。此外，还正在试制或准备试制的有八十余种汽车装配用的橡胶制品及马车使用的马车轮胎。
    国营沈阳造纸厂铜网厂试制二百目精密铜网已于今年五月成功。这种铜网是供机械工业、化学工业过滤机器油用的。这种铜网每平方吋内有四万个小孔、铜线比头发丝还细二分之一，过去一向依赖进口，现国内已开始生产。地方国营牡丹江造纸厂试制工业用钢纸亦已成功，并于六月份开始生产。这种产品具有抗涨、绝缘、抗油、耐燃等特点，适于做运输工业上的油箱、引火管、汽缸垫和电器工业方面的绝缘器材，纺织工业用的线轴、轴承，以及矿工用的安全帽，电焊工用的防护面具等。
    国营上海第三制药厂试制的金霉素已经成功，并已开始生产。金霉素是医治腹膜炎、副伤寒、斑疹伤寒、砂眼等疾病的珍贵药品，并能治疗青霉素不能医治的混合感染肺炎。上海工业试验所研究用发酵法制造葡萄糖酸钙已成功。这种药供缺乏钙质的慢性病人及孕妇、幼儿服用；同时是葡萄糖酸锑钠（治血吸虫病特效药）的主要原料。过去，我国用电解法制造葡萄糖酸钙成本很高，不能大量生产，因而需要从国外进口；现在用发酵法来制造葡萄糖酸钙，成本低廉、品质优良、适于大量生产。国营齐齐哈尔医疗器械厂学习苏联先进经验，于今年五月份试制成功方型高压灭菌柜。这种产品在我国还是第一次制造，它的部件很精密，灭菌效力达六个气压。
