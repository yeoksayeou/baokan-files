Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 23rd: The Soviet government's note to the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States is as follows:

On October 23rd, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, V.M. Molotov, received the French Ambassador, Mr. Louis Joxe, the British Ambassador, Mr. William Hayter, and the American Ambassador, Mr. Charles Bohlen, and delivered to them the Soviet government's reply to the notes from the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States dated September 10th, 1954.

The French government's note of September 10th, 1954, and the Soviet government's note of October 23rd, 1954, are as follows:

    The French Government's Note of September 10th, 1954

The French Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and has the honor to make the following statement:

(1) The French government, after consulting with the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, with the governments of other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and with the governments of Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany, has carefully studied the Soviet government's note of July 24th and its statement of August 4th.

  (2) In these notes, the Soviet government repeated the proposals it had made, which were already fully discussed at the Berlin Conference. The French government attaches great importance to European security, but a beneficial discussion of this issue cannot be held unless the fundamental interests of all parties concerned are guaranteed. European security cannot be achieved by a general treaty as proposed by the Soviet government. The only way to achieve European security is to resolve specific issues, the most pressing of which are the German and Austrian questions.

  (3) The French government notes that the Soviet government has once again insisted that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an "aggressive military bloc." The purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is purely defensive and is fully in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. This organization was established to enable Western democracies to defend themselves against the threat created since 1945 by the establishment of a heavily armed Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe. It is now a free association of like-minded countries with ties beyond purely military connections. Any modification or abandonment of this concept is out of the question.

  (4) The participation of the Federal Republic of Germany, together with other peace-loving countries of Western Europe, in a defense system long after East Germany's rearmament will not constitute a threat to European security but is the best guarantee against any country threatening or using force alone. This is the best guarantee for the security of all of Germany's neighbors, for the security of Germany itself, and for the security of all of Europe.

  (5) The Soviet government has not put forward any new proposals for resolving the German question in its note of July 24th and its statement of August 4th. According to the security treaty proposed by the Soviet Union, the current state of division in Germany would continue, which is contrary to the deep desire of the German people. On the other hand, the French government believes that Germany must be reunified in freedom as soon as possible. The only way to do this is to hold free elections throughout Germany under international supervision. The French government remains willing to negotiate based on the practical and feasible plan for holding elections at an early date, as proposed by the three Western powers at the Berlin Conference.

  (6) However, the simplest step towards enhancing European security remains the early resolution of the Austrian question. Regarding this point, the French government must once again express the view that the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty should not, as the Soviet government suggests, depend on the resolution of issues of a pan-European scope, on a German peace treaty, or on anything else unrelated to the Austrian peace treaty. At the Berlin Conference, the French government suggested accepting the Soviet proposals regarding all previously unresolved clauses of the Austrian peace treaty, if the Soviet Union would quickly accept this treaty.

The French government is now willing to resubmit that proposal. If the Soviet government is willing to sign a treaty with these clauses, an agreement on the restoration of Austria's freedom and independence, which has been promised to Austria since 1943, could be reached immediately.

  (7) An agreement on disarmament would undoubtedly help create an atmosphere necessary for a beneficial discussion of European security issues. The French government hopes to eliminate the use, possession, and manufacture of all atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction within a system that includes a simultaneous and substantial reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces to agreed-upon levels, with the entire plan implemented under effective supervision and control according to an agreed-upon timetable. The French government presented proposals in the recent discussions of the United Nations Subcommittee that could have led to progress. Although the Soviet government was unwilling to consider these proposals at the time, the French government is willing to continue seeking an acceptable and effective agreement and hopes that the Soviet government will contribute to this goal.

  (8) If Europe is to achieve genuine security, practical and consensual solutions must be found for these issues. Further international discussions on these issues will only be useful if the prospects for finding solutions are better than those indicated by the detailed discussions at the Berlin Conference or by the Soviet Union's recent notes. The French government remains determined to do everything possible to enable progress to be made on these issues. It hopes that the Soviet government will take the following steps to contribute to such progress:

  (A) Sign an Austrian peace treaty containing the previously unresolved clauses proposed by the Soviet Union, as suggested by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Austria at the Berlin Conference, a suggestion which the French government now reiterates;

  (B) Agree to free elections on the basis suggested by the French government in Berlin, as the first important step towards the restoration of Germany's unification in freedom. If progress can be made in this area, the French government would agree to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to complete the actions taken on these issues and then consider the remaining aspects of European security. The French government also sincerely hopes that the United Nations disarmament discussions will be successful.

    The Soviet Government's Note of October 23rd, 1954

Regarding the French government's note of September 10th, 1954, the Soviet government deems it necessary to make the following statement:

The Soviet government, in its note of July 24th, suggested to the French government, as well as to the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, that a pan-European conference be held to study the issue of establishing a system of collective security in Europe. On August 4th, the Soviet government suggested to the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four major powers be held to initially discuss this issue and to continue studying the German question at that meeting.

To facilitate the resolution of the European security issue, the Soviet government put forward a draft of a "Pan-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe," while expressing its willingness to study other suggestions regarding this issue.

This draft proposes the establishment in Europe of a system of collective security capable of ensuring the maintenance of peace through the collective efforts of all relevant European countries, regardless of their social and political systems.

The basis of the pan-European treaty draft proposed by the Soviet Union is the principle that its member states will take collective action against any threat or armed attack against any signatory to the treaty, as well as the principle of economic cooperation. This means that any attempt at aggression by any country will immediately require collective sanctions against the aggressor.

Therefore, the pan-European treaty draft proposed by the Soviet Union contains genuine guarantees for the security of France and Poland, for the security of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, and for the security of all European countries, large and small. At the same time, it creates the most favorable conditions for the re-establishment of Germany's national unity and for Germany's free and peaceful development.

No country that truly hopes to consolidate peace in Europe can refuse to cooperate with other European countries to establish an effective pan-European security system. As far as the Soviet government is concerned, its starting point has always been this premise: only the joint efforts of European countries can guarantee European security.

The French government has objected to the Soviet draft, but it has not put forward any of its own proposals for guaranteeing collective security in Europe. Instead of contributing to the collective security of Europe, the French government, as recent events have shown, continues to pursue a policy of piecing together military alliances in Europe.

The French government has also taken the lead in defending the North Atlantic military bloc, insisting that this bloc is for defensive purposes, even though there is ample evidence that this alliance, in its current form, is aggressive. The military leaders of the North Atlantic bloc do not deny that this military alliance is primarily aimed at the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The note of September 10th mentions the existence of a "Soviet bloc with strong armed forces" in Eastern Europe, attempting to use this as an excuse to justify the establishment of this alliance. This effort is completely untenable because, in fact, no such bloc exists. Now, preparations are underway to implement plans to rearm West Germany and incorporate it into the North Atlantic Alliance, which can only confirm that this is a further increase in the aggressive schemes of this alliance.

In this situation, the Soviet government again deems it necessary to draw the French government's attention to the fact that the establishment of military alliances cannot contribute to the consolidation of peace and security in Europe. The creation of such alliances, which pit some European countries against others, will inevitably lead to a further aggravation of international tensions, and this is directly contrary to the interests of consolidating peace in Europe. The French government must bear the responsibility for the consequences of such a policy, which is incompatible with the interests of European security, by taking this path and refusing to participate in the organization of a European collective security system.

The resolution of the German question is of decisive importance for ensuring European security. This means that the most important and urgent task is to restore Germany's unity, to make it a peaceful and democratic country, and to conclude a peace treaty with it.

The issue of German reunification, which remains unresolved and divided into two mutually hostile parts, can no longer be delayed. The interests of the national security of European countries and the interests of the German people themselves demand a solution to the issue of German reunification, so that the people of Europe can be reassured that a unified Germany will not fall into the hands of the deadly enemies of peace, German militarists, and revanchists, but will steadfastly embark on the path of peaceful development and the establishment of good-neighborly relations with other countries.

As before, the Soviet government believes that in order to restore Germany's unity, it is necessary to hold free all-German elections. In conducting these elections, the German people must have the opportunity to express their free will to restore Germany as a peace-loving, democratic, and unified country.

At the Berlin Four-Power Conference, no agreement was reached on the issue of holding all-German elections to restore Germany's unity. The obstacle to reaching an agreement was primarily the plan to establish a "European Defense Community," which would remilitarize West Germany and incorporate it into a military alliance.

The rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty by the French National Assembly provides the possibility for approaching the positions of the four powers on the issue of German reunification and holding all-German elections for this purpose.

The Soviet government expresses its willingness to re-examine the proposals for holding all-German elections, which were submitted by the United Kingdom and supported by France and the United States at the Berlin Conference, while fully taking into account the aforementioned new circumstances. The Soviet government does so based on the premise that the corresponding proposals put forward by the Soviet Union will be studied at the same time.

The Soviet government believes that it is now possible for countries to reach an agreement on this issue. If this undeniable argument is acknowledged, then unifying Germany according to peaceful and democratic guidelines is the primary task.

Regarding this point, the Soviet government deems it necessary to pay particular attention to the new plans that remilitarize West Germany and incorporate it into the military alliances of certain Western countries. These new plans were revealed after the Nine-Power London Conference, which ended on October 3rd this year. The meetings currently being held separately in Paris are also related to these new plans.

Completely contrary to the obligations undertaken by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, together with the Soviet Union, to prevent the revival of German militarism, the separate agreements in London and Paris stipulate the establishment in the near future of a West German army of 500,000 men, as well as its own large air force, tank units, and its own military general staff.

West Germany's heavy industry, primarily the heavy industry of the Ruhr, is now once again massively producing armaments. Leading the West German armed forces will still be those generals who once built Hitler's army and, together with Hitler, carried out aggression against Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and many other European countries.

In this situation, it is difficult to believe that the Bonn government, despite its formal guarantees to limit the size of the West German army and its armaments, will actually do so. Not too distant experience has proven that once German militarists and revanchists begin to build their own army, they will not hesitate to use all means to expand the number of troops and armaments.

The London decisions open the road to the revival of German militarism. After this, West German militarists and revanchists can freely carry out their aggressive policies in Europe.

It is evident that West Germany is turning into a dangerous hotbed for a new war in Europe. The London decisions stipulate that a remilitarized West Germany will join a military bloc composed of certain Western European countries, which is in opposition to other European countries. This time, the military bloc to be established is not the military bloc of the former six Western European countries—France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—but a military bloc composed of these six countries plus the United Kingdom. It is deceiving public opinion to believe that the London plan to establish a new military bloc is more in line with the interests of the security of the peoples of Europe than the bankrupt plan to establish a "European Defense Community."

The London plan also stipulates that West Germany will be drawn into the North Atlantic bloc, which allows German militarists to have a direct influence on the North Atlantic bloc—further strengthening its aggressiveness. Just recently, the French National Assembly considered West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic bloc unacceptable because it was incompatible with the interests of French security. Allowing a remilitarized West Germany to join the North Atlantic bloc in accordance with the London agreements is especially incompatible with the interests of European security.

The instigators of these resolutions, which indulge German militarists, are the aggressive groups of countries that are trying to achieve world domination by notorious "power politics."

The London agreements are also incompatible with the restoration of the German people's sovereignty. In fact, this agreement, contrary to what some people say, will not lead to the termination of the occupation regime, but will allow the occupying forces to remain stationed in West Germany until 1998, that is, until the end of this century. West Germany will still be bound by the enslaving provisions of the "Bonn Treaty."

All this shows that the London agreements, which lead to the restoration of German militarism and the incorporation of West Germany into an aggressive military bloc, are fundamentally contrary to the interests of maintaining peace, and this agreement will deepen the threat of a new war in Europe.

Once these resolutions are implemented, West Germany cannot be regarded as a peace-loving country, which will make the restoration of Germany's unity impossible for a long time.

The Soviet government believes it must state that the French government's agreement to accept and implement the London agreements is a clear violation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in 1944. This treaty obliges both parties to "take jointly all necessary measures to eliminate any new threat arising from Germany and to prevent actions that could make any new attempts at aggression on the part of Germany possible." The London agreements, however, openly aim at reviving German militarism, which would create a threat to the security of the peoples of Europe.

The Franco-Soviet treaty obliges the two countries "not to conclude any alliance aimed against one of the contracting parties, nor to participate in any such alliance." The implementation of the London agreements, however, means that France will join a military bloc against the Soviet Union together with a revived German militarism.

Since the French government has taken such actions that violate the basic principles of the Franco-Soviet treaty, then France, by implementing this policy, is to blame if it once again finds itself face to face with its old enemy—German militarism. The responsibility also lies with France for putting itself in opposition to the Soviet Union, disregarding the fact that the security of both France and the Soviet Union requires joint efforts to prevent the revival of German militarism.

The measures against West Germany drafted in London and Paris also directly violate the proposals of the French and British governments, which were supported by the U.S. government this June, regarding universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Currently, the United Nations is reviewing the proposals of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. At the same time, the Soviet government suggests that the above-mentioned proposals of France and Britain be used as the basis for an international convention on this issue.

Therefore, the views of both sides on this important issue are clearly somewhat close. The French government expressed its hope in the note of September 10th to promote the resolution of the disarmament issue. However, it is impossible to suggest universal disarmament on the one hand and implement the remilitarization of West Germany on the other. These two actions are incompatible.

It is well known that there has been a certain degree of easing of international tensions recently. The Soviet government's starting point is that the peace-loving peoples of all countries are concerned and hope that international tensions will be further eased. However, the London resolutions not only fail to help in this regard but will instead contribute to the deterioration of the international situation.

The current situation is such that:

Either the four countries that bear special responsibility for resolving the German question do everything possible to begin reviewing and resolving the most pressing issue—the issue of restoring German unity, which is not only of concern to the German people but also to all peace-loving people in European countries.

Or things will develop to the point where German militarism is revived and West Germany joins an aggressive military bloc, so that Germany will be divided for a long time, and a remilitarized West Germany will become a direct threat to peace in Europe.

In order to promote the resolution of the German question, the Soviet government proposed at the Berlin Conference to withdraw all occupying forces from the eastern and western parts of Germany, leaving only a small number of troops subject to strict limitations. This proposal was linked to the proposals for concluding a peace treaty with Germany and holding all-German elections. No agreement was reached on this issue at the time.

In order to provide favorable conditions for the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany and to promote the resolution of the task of German national unification, the Soviet government suggests discussing the issue of withdrawing occupying forces from the eastern and western parts of Germany with the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, and suggests withdrawing the occupying forces now without delay. Such a decision would help to further ease international tensions and consolidate peace in Europe.

At the same time as resolving this issue, the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States must, with the participation of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, reach an agreement on the number, deployment, and equipment of various German police forces in the eastern and western parts of Germany. This would eliminate all concerns about the rearmament of East and West Germany. It is well known that East Germany does not object to this suggestion, nor does it object to investigating the real situation on the ground now. If West Germany avoids accepting this suggestion, then there is no other reason to explain this other than the desire to accelerate the implementation of the rearmament plan.

Based on the above, the Soviet government suggests to the French government, as well as to the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, that a meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries—France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union—be convened in November this year to discuss the following issues:

(1) Restoring Germany's unity on a peaceful and democratic basis, holding free all-German elections;

  (2) The withdrawal of the four countries' occupying forces from the territories of East and West Germany;

  (3) Convening a pan-European conference to discuss the issue of establishing a European collective security system. As for the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Austria, it is well known that the Soviet government suggested as early as August 12th this year in its note to the Austrian government that a meeting of the ambassadors of the four countries—France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union—be convened in Vienna in order to jointly discuss the issues that are still in dispute in the draft Austrian peace treaty, as well as other issues related to the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty, with representatives of the Austrian government.

In its reply of October 12th, the Austrian government has expressed its willingness to participate in the aforementioned meeting. However, the Soviet government still does not know the views of the French government and the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States on this issue. The Soviet government would like to know whether the governments of the three countries agree that their ambassadors participate in the Vienna meeting to discuss issues related to the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty.

The Soviet government is also sending the same notes to the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States separately.

    就恢复德国统一、举行全德自由选举等问题
    苏联政府复照法英美三国政府
   【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日电：苏联政府致法国、英国和美国政府的照会如下：
    苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫十月二十三日接见法国大使路·约克斯先生、英国大使威·海特尔先生和美国大使查·波伦先生，交给他们苏联政府对法国、英国和美国政府一九五四年九月十日的照会的复照。
    法国政府一九五四年九月十日的照会和苏联政府一九五四年十月二十三日的照会如下：
    法国政府一九五四年九月十日的照会
    法国大使馆向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部致意，并有幸发表下列声明：
    （一）法国政府在同美国和英国政府、同北大西洋公约组织的其他国家政府以及奥地利和德意志联邦共和国政府磋商之下，仔细研究了苏联政府七月二十四日的照会和八月四日的声明。
      （二）在这些照会中，苏联政府重复了它所提出的、在柏林会议上已经充分讨论过的建议。法国政府很重视欧洲安全，但是除非一切有关方面的基本利益都得到保障，否则是不能对这个问题进行有益的讨论的。欧洲安全是不能靠苏联政府所提议的那样一种一般性条约来实现的。实现欧洲安全的唯一办法是解决具体问题，其中最迫切的是德国和奥地利问题。
    （三）法国政府注意到，苏联政府又一次硬说北大西洋公约组织是一个“侵略性的军事集团”。北大西洋公约组织的目的纯粹是防御性的，并且是完全符合于联合国宪章的。建立这个组织是为了使西方民主国家能够自卫，以对付自从一九四五年以来因为在东欧建立了一个拥有雄厚武装力量的苏联集团而造成的威胁。它现在是意见一致的国家的自由结合，具有除纯粹军事联系以外的联系。修改或放弃这个观念是根本谈不到的。
    （四）德意志联邦共和国在东德重新武装以后很久同西欧爱好和平的其他国家一起参加一个防务体系，绝不会构成对欧洲安全的威胁，而是为了防止任何国家单独以武力相威胁或使用武力。这是德国所有的邻国的安全、德国本身的安全以及整个欧洲的安全的最好保证。
    （五）苏联政府在七月二十四日的照会和八月四日的声明中都没有提出解决德国问题的任何新建议。根据苏联提议的安全条约，德国目前的分裂状态将继续保持下去，这是和德国人民的深切愿望背道而驰的。另外一方面，法国政府认为德国必须尽早在自由中恢复统一。要做到这一点，唯一的办法是在国际监督下在德国全国举行自由选举。法国政府仍然愿意根据西方三国在柏林会议上所提出的早日举行选举的切实可行的计划来进行谈判。
    （六）然而导向增进欧洲安全的最简单的步骤仍然是早日解决奥地利问题。关于这一点，法国政府必须再一次表示这样的意见：对奥和约的缔结不应像苏联政府建议的那样取决于全欧范围的问题的解决，取决于对德和约或其他任何同对奥和约无关的事情。在柏林会议上，法国政府建议接受苏联提出的关于对奥和约中一切先前未达成协议的条款，如果苏联迅速接受这个和约的话。
    法国政府现在愿意重新提出那个建议。假如苏联政府愿意签署具有这些条款的条约，那就可以立即就恢复奥地利的自由和独立问题达成协议，这种自由和独立是从一九四三年以来就答应给奥地利的。
    （七）就裁减军备问题达成协议无疑会有助于创造一种有益地讨论欧洲安全问题所必需的气氛。法国政府希望能在一个包括同时大量削减常规军备和武装部队到一致同意的水平的制度以内取消一切原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的使用、保有和制造，整个这个计划将依照一致同意的时间表在有效的监督和管制下实行。法国政府在联合国小组委员会最近进行的讨论中，提出了本来可以导致进展的建议。虽然苏联政府当时不愿考虑这些建议，但法国政府愿继续寻求一个可以接受的和有效的协议，并希望苏联政府对这个目标作出贡献。
      （八）如果要欧洲得到真正的安全，就必须为这些问题找到切实可行的一致同意的解决方法。只有在寻找解决方法的前景比柏林会议的详尽讨论所表明的、或比苏联最近提出照会时所表明的来得好的情况下，对这些问题进行进一步的国际讨论才会有用。法国政府仍然决心尽一切力量使得能够在这些问题上获得进展。它希望苏联政府采取下列步骤来对这种进展作出贡献：
      （甲）签订包含苏联提出的先前没有取得协议的条款的对奥和约，美国、联合王国、法国和奥地利曾在柏林会议上提过这样的建议，现在法国政府重申这个建议；
      （乙）同意在法国政府在柏林所建议的基础上进行自由选举，作为走向德国在自由中恢复统一的第一个重要步骤，如果能在这方面取得进展，那么法国政府就同意召开美国、法国、联合王国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外长会议来完成在这些问题上采取的行动，然后考虑欧洲安全其余方面的问题。法国政府还诚恳地希望联合国的裁军讨论能够成功。
    苏联政府一九五四年十月二十三日的照会
    关于法国政府一九五四年九月十日的照会，苏联政府认为有必要发表如下的声明：
      苏联政府在七月二十四日所提出的照会中向法国政府以及英国和美国政府建议举行一个全欧会议，以研究建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。八月四日，苏联政府向法国、英国和美国政府建议由四大国外长举行会议初步讨论这个问题，并在这个会议上继续研究德国问题。
    为了便利解决欧洲安全问题起见，苏联政府曾提出“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案，同时表示愿意研究有关这个问题的其他建议。
    这个草案建议在欧洲建立一个能够通过各有关欧洲国家——不问其社会和政治制度如何——的集体努力使和平的维护得到保障的集体安全体系。
    苏联提出的全欧条约草案的基础，是它的成员国采取集体行动反对对这个条约的任何签字国的威胁和武装攻击的原则以及在经济方面合作的原则。这意味着任何国家进行侵略的尝试将立即要求对侵略者实行集体制裁。
    因此苏联提出的全欧条约草案，包含着对法国和波兰、对英国和苏联以及对一切欧洲大小国家的安全的真正保证。同时它为重新建立德国的国家统一、为德国的自由和平发展创造了最有利的条件。
    没有一个真正希望巩固欧洲和平的国家能够拒绝同其他欧洲国家合作以建立一个有效的全欧安全体系。就苏联政府来说，它的出发点一直是这个前提：只有欧洲国家的共同努力才能够保障欧洲的安全。
    法国政府对苏联的草案提出反对的意见，可是它并没有提出它自己的保障欧洲集体安全的任何建议。法国政府不但没有对保障欧洲的集体安全作出贡献，反而像最近的事态所显示的，继续执行拼凑欧洲的军事联盟的方针。
    法国政府又出头为北大西洋军事集团辩护，硬说这个集团是为了防御的目的，虽然有许多事情证明目前形式的这个联盟是侵略性的。北大西洋集团的军事领导人物并不讳言这个军事联盟首先是对付苏联和人民民主国家的。九月十日的照会提到在东欧存在着一个“拥有雄厚武装力量的苏联集团”，企图以此为借口来为建立这个联盟辩护。这种努力是完全站不住脚的，因为事实上这种集团是不存在的。现在，为了实现重新武装西德并把它并入北大西洋联盟的计划，准备工作正在进行中，这只能证实这是进一步增加这个联盟的侵略性的勾当。
    在这种情况下，苏联政府再度认为有必要提请法国政府注意这个事实：建立军事联盟不能有助于巩固欧洲的和平和安全。创立这种使一些欧洲国家和另一些欧洲国家作对的联盟，就必然会导致国际紧张局势的进一步严重化，而且这是直接违背巩固欧洲和平的利益的。法国政府走这条路，而拒绝参与组织一个欧洲集体安全体系，法国政府对于这样一种同欧洲安全的利益不相容的政策的后果，必须承担责任。
    德国问题的解决对保障欧洲安全是具有决定性重要意义的。这就是说，最重要和最紧迫的任务是恢复德国的统一，使它成为一个和平的和民主的国家，并且同它缔结和约。
    再不能延不解决仍然被分裂成互相敌对的两个部分的德国统一问题了。欧洲国家民族安全的利益和德国人民本身的利益要求解决德国重新统一的问题，好使欧洲各国人民可以放心，相信一个统一的德国不会落入和平的死敌、德国军国主义分子和复仇分子手中，而会坚定不移地走上和平发展和同其他国家建立睦邻关系的道路。
    像以前一样，苏联政府认为，为了恢复德国的统一，有必要举行全德自由选举。在进行这种选举时，德国人民必须有机会表达他们要把德国恢复为
  一个爱好和平的、民主的、统一的国家的自由意志。
    在柏林四国会议上，关于举行全德选举以恢复德国的统一的问题没有达成协议。阻挠协议达成的首先是建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划，这个计划要使西德重新军国主义化，并且要把它并入军事联盟。
    法国国民议会拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约这件事，提供了四国在德国重新统一和举行为此目的的全德选举问题上的主张可以接近的可能性。
    苏联政府表示愿意在充分考虑到上述新的情况的同时，再度研究在柏林会议上经英国提出并经法国和美国支持的关于举行全德选举的建议。苏联政府这样做是从下列前提出发的：苏联提出的相应的建议将同时予以研究。
    苏联政府认为现在各国对这个问题有可能达成协议。如果承认这个无可置辩的论点，那么，按照和平和民主的方针来统一德国就是主要的任务。
    关于这一点，苏联政府认为有必要特别提请注意那些使西德重新军国主义化并把它并入某些西方国家的军事联盟的新计划。在今年十月三日结束的九国伦敦会议之后，这些新计划就透露出来了。目前在巴黎分别举行的会议也是和这些新计划有关的。
    和法国、英国、美国同苏联在一起承担的防止德国军国主义复活的义务完全相反，伦敦和巴黎的单独协定规定在最近将来建立一支拥有五十万人的西德陆军，还有它自己的庞大的空军、坦克部队和它自己的军事参谋本部。
    西德的重工业，首先是鲁尔的重工业，现在又重新大规模地生产军火。领导西德武装部队的，仍将是那些曾经建立希特勒军队并和希特勒一起对捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、法国、苏联、英国和其他许多欧洲国家进行侵略的将领们。
    在这种情况下，波恩政府虽然在形式上保证限制西德军队的数量和它的军备，但这是难以令人置信的。不算太久的经验证明：德国军国主义者和复仇主义者一旦开始建立自己的军队，就会不惜用一切手段来扩充军队的名额和军备。
    伦敦决议打开了德国军国主义复活的道路。此后，西德的军国主义者和复仇主义者就可以放手来执行他们在欧洲的侵略政策了。
    由此可见，西德在变为欧洲新战争的危险的温床。伦敦决议规定重新军国主义化的西德加入由某些西欧国家组成的、和其他欧洲国家对立的军事集团。这一次要建立的不是以前曾经计划要建立的西欧六国——法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡——的军事集团，而是这六个国家再加上一个英国所组成的军事集团。如果认为建立新军事集团的伦敦计划会比已经破产了的、建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划更符合欧洲各国人民安全的利益，那就是欺骗舆论。
    伦敦计划还规定把西德拉入北大西洋集团，这就使德国军国主义者有可能对北大西洋集团产生直接影响——进一步加强它的侵略性。就在不久以前，法国国民议会就曾经认为西德参加北大西洋集团是不能容许的，因为这是和法国安全的利益不相容的。按照伦敦协定的规定让重新军国主义化的西德加入北大西洋集团，尤其是和欧洲安全利益不相容。
    放纵德国军国主义者的这种决议的主使者，就是竭力想借臭名远扬的“实力政策”来取得世界统治地位的国家的侵略集团。
    伦敦协定和恢复德国人民的主权也是不相容的。事实上，这项协定并不像有些人所说的那样，会导致占领制度的终止，而是要使占领军在西德一直驻扎到一九九八年，那就是到本世纪末。西德仍然要受奴役性的“波恩条约”条款的束缚。
    这一切说明：导致恢复德国军国主义和使西德加入军事性侵略集团的伦敦协定，是根本违反维护和平的利益的，这个协定并且会加深欧洲新战争的威胁。
    一旦实现这些决议，西德就不能被看成是爱好和平的国家，而这就会使恢复德国的统一在长时期内成为不可能。
    苏联政府认为必须声明：法国政府同意接受和实现伦敦协定，是明显地违反一九四四年签订的法苏同盟互助条约的。这个条约责成双方“共同采取
  一切必要措施以消除从德国方面产生的任何新威胁，并制止足以使德国方面的任何新的侵略企图成为可能的行动”。而伦敦协定却公开以复活德国军国主义为目的，这就会造成对欧洲各国人民的安全的威胁。
    法苏条约责成两国“不得缔结旨在反对缔约国
  一方的任何联盟，也不得参加任何这样的联盟”。而实现伦敦协定却意味着法国将和复活中的德国军国主义一起加入反对苏联的军事集团。
    法国政府既然采取这种违反法苏条约基本原则的行动，那么，法国因执行这种政策而使它再次同它的世仇——德国军国主义——面面相对，就是咎由自取。法国不顾法苏两国的安全都要求共同努力防止德国军国主义复活的事实，而使自己和苏联对立起来，这个责任也在它自己身上。
      在伦敦和巴黎拟定的对西德的措施，也直接违反法国和英国政府在今年六月提出并且受到美国政
  府支持的、关于普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题
  的建议。
      目前，联合国正在审查法、英两国和苏联就裁
  减军备和禁止原子武器问题提出的建议，同时，苏
  联政府建议把法国和英国的上述建议作为关于这个
  问题的国际公约的基础。
      因此，双方对这个重要问题的看法显然已经有
  所接近。法国政府在九月十日的照会中表示希望促
  进裁军问题的解决。但是，不可能一面建议普遍裁
  减军备，一面实行西德重新军国主义化。这两个行动是不能相容的。
    大家知道，最近国际紧张局势有了一定程度的缓和。苏联政府的出发点是：爱好和平的各国人民关切地希望国际紧张局势进一步缓和。但是，伦敦的决议不仅不能在这方面有所帮助，反而会促成国际局势的恶化。
    目前形成了这种情况：
    要么就是对解决德国问题负有特别责任的四个国家竭尽一切努力，以着手审查和解决最迫切的问题——恢复德国统一的问题，这个问题不仅是德国人民关心的，同时也是欧洲各国一切爱好和平的人民关心的。
    要么就是事情发展到德国军国主义复活和西德加入侵略性的军事集团，那样德国就会长久分裂下去，而重新军国主义化的西德就会成为对欧洲和平的直接威胁。
    苏联政府为了促进德国问题的解决，曾经在柏林会议上提出从德国东西两部撤退所有占领军而只留下受到严格限制的少数部队的建议。这个建议是和缔结对德和约及举行全德选举的建议联系在一起的。当时在这个问题上没有达成协议。
    为了替德国两个部分的接近提供有利条件和促进德意志民族统一任务的解决，苏联政府建议和英国、法国及美国三国政府讨论从德国东西两部撤退占领军的问题，并建议现在就毫不拖延地撤退占领军。这种决定会有助于国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，并且会巩固欧洲的和平。
    和解决这个问题同时，苏联、法国、英国和美国还必须在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的参加下，就德国东西两部各种德国警察的员额、配置和装备达成协议。这就可以消除对德国东部和西部的重新武装的各种挂虑。大家知道，东德方面不反对这个建议，也不反对现在就就地调查真实情况。西德方面如果避不接受这个建议，那么，除了因为要竭力加速实行重新武装的计划以外，就再没有其他理由可以解释了。
    根据上述，苏联政府向法国政府以及英国、美国政府建议：在今年十一月召开法、英、美、苏四国外交部长的会议，来讨论以下问题：
    （一）在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，举行全德自由选举；
      （二）四国占领军撤出东西德的领土；
    （三）召开全欧会议，以讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。至于缔结对奥和约的问题，大家都知道，苏联政府早在今年八月十二日就在它的致奥地利政府的照会中建议在维也纳召开法、英、美、苏四国大使会议，以便和奥地利政府的代表共同讨论对奥和约草案中仍然争持不下的问题以及有关缔结对奥和约的其他问题。
    奥地利政府在十月十二日的复照中，已经表示愿意参加上述会议。然而，苏联政府还不知道法国政府以及英、美两国政府在这个问题上的看法如何。苏联政府愿意知道三国政府是否同意它们的大使参加维也纳会议，以讨论有关缔结对奥和约的问题。
    苏联政府同时把同样的照会分别送达英国和美国政府。
