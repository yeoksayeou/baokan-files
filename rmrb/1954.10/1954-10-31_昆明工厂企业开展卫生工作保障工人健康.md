Since the summer and autumn seasons, under the leadership of the relevant Party committees, factories and enterprises in Kunming City have established or improved factory and enterprise health work committees, and have gradually carried out preventive health care work, which has played a certain role in ensuring the health of workers. Some factories and enterprises have gradually made health work a regular practice.

The Shilongba Power Plant, Yunnan Textile Factory, Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory, and other units have used movies, slides, pictures, wall newspapers, and discussion meetings to publicize health knowledge to employees, cultivate healthy habits such as not drinking raw water, and help employees establish workshop, environmental, and personal hygiene systems. The catering staff of most factories and enterprises in Kunming City have received hygiene training, and many catering staff have formulated hygiene covenants for kitchens and individuals, developing habits of frequent bathing, frequent washing of clothes, and frequent trimming of fingernails. Factories and enterprises with more than two hundred people in Kunming City have all carried out preventive vaccinations against typhoid fever, cholera, and other diseases. Administrative departments and trade unions of sixteen units, such as the Yunnan Brick and Tile Factory, regularly distribute malaria prevention drugs for employees to take. Factories and enterprises in Kunming City with more female workers have successively established or are preparing to establish workshop hygiene rooms and nurseries. In addition, factories and enterprises in Kunming City have continued to carry out the patriotic health campaign in depth, and environmental sanitation has improved compared to the past. General health personnel have also adopted the method of going to workshops for rounds to treat illnesses.

Labor protection equipment in some factories in Kunming City has also been improved. For example, after some high-temperature workshops at the Shilongba Power Plant increased the number of skylights, the room temperature dropped; the plant's high-temperature workshops also added soybean milk, licorice water, salt water and other health drinks for workers to drink.

Since Kunming City's factories and enterprises launched summer and autumn health work, the total morbidity rate of each factory has decreased significantly, the physical fitness of workers has improved, and the attendance rate of workers has also increased.

    昆明工厂企业开展卫生工作保障工人健康
    夏、秋季以来，昆明市各工厂企业单位在有关党委领导下，纷纷成立或健全了工厂企业卫生工作委员会，逐步开展预防保健工作，对保障工人身体健康起了一定作用。有的工厂企业单位已使卫生工作逐步走向经常化。
    石龙坝发电厂、云南纺织厂、云南砖瓦厂等单位，利用电影、幻灯、图片、壁报、座谈会等方式向职工宣传卫生常识，培养职工不喝生水等卫生习惯，并帮助职工建立了车间、环境、个人等卫生制度。昆明市绝大部分工厂企业单位的炊事人员都受到了卫生训练，许多炊事人员制定了厨房和个人的卫生公约，养成勤洗澡、勤洗衣、勤剪指甲的习惯。昆明市两百人以上的工厂企业单位，都进行了伤寒、霍乱等疫苗的预防注射；云南砖瓦厂等十六个单位的行政和工会，定期配发预防疟疾的药品给职工服用。昆明市女工较多的工厂企业单位，都已先后设立或准备设立车间卫生室、托儿所。此外，昆明市各工厂企业单位，继续深入开展了爱国卫生运动，环境卫生比过去有了改善；一般卫生人员也采用了下车间巡回治病的办法。
    昆明市部分工厂的劳动保护的设备，也有了改善。如石龙坝发电厂的某些高温车间经过增开天窗以后，室温下降；该厂高温车间并增设豆浆、甘草水、盐开水等保健饮食供给工人饮用。
    昆明市工厂企业单位自开展夏、秋季卫生工作以来，各工厂的总发病率显著下降，工人的体质增强，工人的出勤率也提高了。
