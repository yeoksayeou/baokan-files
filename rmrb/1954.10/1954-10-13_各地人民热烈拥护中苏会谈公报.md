People Across the Country Enthusiastically Support the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué

Beijing

Around 10 a.m. on the 12th, Beijing Post Office trucks, adorned with large banners proclaiming "Celebrating the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué," delivered newspapers to various streets, bringing the good news to the city's residents. Many government offices, factories, and schools held discussion sessions and celebrations for this joyous event. Some leaders of these organizations and schools delivered speeches.

Factory Celebration Evening Parties

Many workshops in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and factories like the Beijing Automotive Transportation Company held celebration evening parties. Beijing model worker and foreman of the No. 2 blast furnace at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Hou Decheng, said, "During our country's recovery period, the Soviet Union helped us; during our country's construction period, the Soviet Union is helping us again. The Soviet Union's help to us is sincere and selfless. This Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué stipulates that the Soviet Union will help us in economic, scientific, and cultural aspects, which will enable our country to complete the general task of the transitional period more smoothly and realize socialist industrialization at an early date." Li Congzhi, a young worker in the power department of the factory, who had visited the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, said, "The seamless steel tube plant, automated blast furnace, and so on at Angang were all built with the help of the Soviet Union. With the selfless help of the Soviet Union, the construction of our country's socialist industrialization will be accelerated." Pan Yansheng, assistant technician of the turbine workshop at the Shijingshan Power Plant, read the newspaper to several veteran workers during his spare time after receiving it. Beijing model worker and stoker of the boiler workshop at the plant, Liang Zengxi, said, "The Soviet Union's concern for us is meticulous. To thank the Soviet government and people, I must work harder in production."

Civil Aviation Company's Discussion Session

Upon hearing the news about the Sino-Soviet talks, the staff of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint-Stock Company felt extremely excited.

At 2 p.m. on the 12th, comrades from the company's management department held a discussion session. They unanimously stated that when the People's Republic of China was about to be established, the Soviet government signed an agreement with our country to establish the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company to assist our country in developing its aviation industry and strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries. Over the past four years, with the help of Soviet experts, the company has overfulfilled its production targets year after year. Now that the staff of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company have made progress in all aspects and have accumulated the necessary experience, the Soviet government is transferring its shares to our country. From their own experience, they feel that the Soviet Union's assistance to the Chinese people is selfless and great. Apprentice aircraft maintenance engineer Li Yiqu, with the help of Soviet experts, has been trained from a mechanic to an apprentice engineer. He said: "Over the past four years, whenever we have had problems, the Soviet comrades have always answered them so specifically." Apprentice ground construction engineer Qian Renjie said: "When experts go out to inspect work, they often inspect every corner, so that there is no waste in our expenditure." Wang Kongxiu, head of the business section, said: "The head of the Soviet management office goes to the airport very early every day to watch the planes take off. This high sense of responsibility is worth learning from." Han Tianling said: "Our civil aviation aircraft have not had any accidents in the past four years. Recently, Soviet experts also proposed to extend the maintenance time of the machines and save gasoline, so that our costs will be further reduced." Fan Buyi, head of the equipment supply department, said: "Soviet experts carefully consider the use of every Renminbi, and the equipment plan is formulated very correctly, which can ensure supply and prevent backlog." He also cited many examples to illustrate the selfless working spirit of Soviet working comrades in helping us develop the civil aviation industry. Everyone unanimously believes that now is the time to seize the opportunity, better summarize work experience in the next two months, learn from Soviet advanced experience, to shoulder this arduous task.

Petroleum Workers Elated

At noon, the newspaper arrived at the Petroleum Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department, and the trade union there immediately broadcast the news of the Sino-Soviet talks to all staff members repeatedly. In the office and in the dining hall, there were groups of people reading the newspaper. Zhi Ruoyu, director of the geological department, said, "I read the news in today's newspaper with great excitement. There are too many facts about the Soviet Union's assistance to us, and I have increasingly deeply realized the Soviet Union's selfless assistance and cordial care for us. Today's communiqué embodies the Soviet Union's sincere and selfless friendship once again. I came from the army, and I especially feel that it is very difficult to master advanced technology and learn to manage modern enterprises. When young China was facing the period of economic recovery, it had no experience in running modern petroleum enterprises at all. The Soviet Union immediately established a joint-stock company with us in Xinjiang Province to extract and refine petroleum based on the principle of equality and mutual assistance. It is a well-equipped, modern enterprise. Over the past few years, Soviet experts have helped us train cadres and accumulate experience. Now, the Soviet Union has transferred the Soviet shares in this enterprise to us. This kind of friendship is incomparable and is a great encouragement to our petroleum workers. We feel that the task in the future is more important. We must further seriously learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and manage this enterprise diligently." Liu Yongsheng, chairman of the bureau's trade union and deputy director of the office, said: "During the Kuomintang rule, petroleum was extracted manually in Xinjiang. After liberation, the Soviet Union helped us establish a modern large enterprise for extracting and refining petroleum in Xinjiang. Now, this contract has not yet expired, and the Soviet Union has transferred the Soviet shares in the company to us. We are so moved by the Soviet Union's profound friendship to our country. We must more actively learn management experience from Soviet comrades, actively prepare our forces, and welcome the arrival of new tasks."

Scientists' Joy

Our country's famous scientists read the "Joint Communiqué on the Signing of the Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement between China and the Soviet Union" with excitement. Qian Chongshu, director of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and biologist, said in his written opinion to this newspaper: Since liberation, China's major achievements in all aspects have been inseparable from the selfless assistance given to us by the Soviet Union, and this is also true in science. For example, the Michurin theory and the Pavlov theory have begun to become a guiding ideology in today's Chinese biological circles, which has guided our country's biological research work to achieve new achievements in the short few years since liberation. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement will make the scientific and technological exchanges between the two countries more regular in the future; this will promote our country's scientific and technological work to achieve more achievements. Liu Xianzhu, vice president of Tsinghua University, China's famous industrial university, wrote in his contribution to this newspaper: "The signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement has a historical and great significance not only for the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also for all mankind. Because the further cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in science and technology will surely promote the vigorous development of the scientific and technological undertakings of the two countries, and any new achievements in the scientific and technological fields of the two countries will further strengthen the world's peace forces." Mao Yisheng, director of the Railway Research Institute, also expressed his heartfelt joy at the signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement. He said: During the period when our country is implementing socialist transformation, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement is a great encouragement to our country; such a deep friendship has never existed in human history.

Zhao Jiuzhang, director of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: I have been engaged in scientific research for many years, and this is the first time I have seen such a selfless, sincere, and mutually respectful exchange of scientific and technological achievements. Before liberation, the earthquake research work of the Institute of Geophysics had only one station and four cadres in the whole country for twenty years. After liberation, with the large-scale development of the national economy, earthquake scientific work has developed greatly. A large number of young people have poured into this scientific field, but what follows is that many complex theoretical and technical problems that are difficult to solve in actual work are encountered. Under such circumstances, the Soviet Union further gave us such selfless assistance, and I felt an uncontrollable excitement from the bottom of my heart. The famous physicist Wang Ganchang said: China's physical research work has not been able to develop due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' various destructions. In recent years, with the care of the Party and the government, the work has made new achievements, but those of us who are engaged in physical research work always feel that the current level of work is far behind the needs of the country. Undoubtedly, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement will greatly improve our country's physical research work. As a Chinese scientific worker, I want to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science more humbly.

Good News Reaches the Classroom

All the teachers and students of Beijing Normal University were extremely excited about the communiqué of the talks between the governments of China and the Soviet Union. Chen Yuan, representative of the National People's Congress and president of Beijing Normal University, issued a written statement on this matter. He said: "The communiqué of the Sino-Soviet talks is really exciting and grateful. Sixty years ago, our Lushunkou was forcibly occupied by imperialists, and it was not until the victory of the great Anti-Japanese War that it returned to the hands of the working people. We thank the Soviet government for accepting the proposal of our government in 1952 to extend the period of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Lushunkou, and for deciding today to withdraw Soviet troops and transfer the equipment in the area to our government free of charge when our national defense forces are consolidated. Such sincere and selfless friendship is something that our Chinese people will never forget. We are convinced that the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union is a great wall to defend the Far East and world peace, and any aggressive conspiracies of the imperialists will be shattered. We will surely achieve greater and more brilliant victories."

As soon as the teachers and students of the Renmin University of China saw the People's Daily, everyone rushed to read the communiqué on the Sino-Soviet talks published on the front page. Many teachers and students excitedly expressed their thoughts and opinions. The first-year students of the Law Department held a discussion session after reading the newspaper at noon. The students expressed unlimited joy at this communiqué, which embodies the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Everyone unanimously believed that the joint declaration of China and the Soviet Union shows the consistent peaceful diplomatic policy of China and the Soviet Union. The various joint communiqués of China and the Soviet Union deeply express the Soviet Union's great selfless assistance and care for China. Wang Jinding, associate professor of the Chinese Language Teaching and Research Section of the Renmin University of China, and others said excitedly: This communiqué not only shows the further development of the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, but also shows the increasing consolidation and growth of our country's defense forces.

Two classes of the Department of Politics of the Central University for Nationalities held a discussion session. Some of them came from Heilongjiang, and some came from the Kangzang Plateau. Everyone's heart was deeply touched by this deep friendship. They unanimously stated that the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué once again demonstrated the Soviet Union's assistance to our country, which is incomparably sincere. Wang Zhongqing, a Hui student, not only carefully read the communiqué on this day, but also specially reviewed Chairman Mao's work "The Greatest Friendship." He said: The Soviet Union's assistance to our country has once again encouraged the confidence of all ethnic groups in our country to build socialism.

Railway Workers Increased Confidence

Railway workers warmly support the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué. More than 30 employees of Beijing West Station held a discussion session. Engineering and technical personnel from the Design Bureau and the Capital Construction Bureau of the New Line Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways also discussed their feelings. Workers at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory scrambled to buy the newspaper on the same day. Tens of thousands of employees building the Jining-Ulan Bator Railway on the Inner Mongolia grassland collectively listened to the broadcast about the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué at the construction site along the line. Chen Wude, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" strike at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, said: "With such a good friend as the Soviet Union, any difficulty can be overcome. The Soviet Union's comprehensive and selfless assistance to our country will surely promote the early arrival of our country's socialist society."

Many engineering and technical personnel know that it is very difficult to build the Lanzhou-Almaty and Jining-Ulan Bator railways. From Lanzhou to the Xinjiang border, it is necessary to pass through the vast Gobi Desert, frost-heave areas, and uninhabited grasslands. The climate is very special. In summer, it is necessary to wear leather clothes at night, and there is also a severe lack of water along the line. The Jining to the Mongolian People's Republic border is all desert and grassland, the climate is very dry, and water is also scarce. It was unimaginable to build railways in these places in the past. Zhang Dayong, an engineer of the New Line Engineering Bureau, saw that the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué said that the Soviet government would provide the Chinese government with comprehensive technical assistance, and his confidence increased a hundredfold. He said: "After I visited the Soviet Exhibition Hall's electric locomotive, I increased my confidence in building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the Jining-Erenhot Railway. After seeing the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué, my confidence was even stronger. We must build these two railways on schedule in accordance with the national plan." In order to ensure the quality of these two railways, many engineers said that they must strengthen the study of advanced Soviet experience.

The workers building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway expressed that they would open the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway as soon as possible. Model worker Zhang Songnian is designing a track-laying machine. He said that he will design the track-laying machine as soon as possible and hand it over to the track-nailing team for use, and strive to promote small-scale mechanized construction methods and strive to lay the steel rails to Urumqi as soon as possible. Zhang Tongshun, a senior engineer from the Northwest Design Branch, is more than sixty years old. He was very excited after seeing the communiqué. He said: "This railway bears the important responsibility of international transportation and is of great significance to our country's economic construction. Now the machines that the Soviet Union is helping us with are all transported from Manchuria in the Northeast; in the future, they can be transported directly to the Northwest via Urumqi." He said that in the survey and design work, he must seriously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, conduct more investigation and research, and ensure the good design quality of this railway. The technical personnel who participated in the survey of the Wuwei-Yumen section said that they would ensure that the information is supplied on time. The workers at the Gulang Gorge project site, after hearing the communiqué of the Sino-Soviet talks, unanimously expressed: to better promote the Soviet experience of large blasting, blow up a flat avenue in Gulang Gorge, and let the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway quickly lay over it.

Luda City

The people of Luda enthusiastically support the communiqué on the Sino-Soviet talks with unparalleled excitement and gratitude.

The employees of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company and the Soviet experts who spend all day with them cheered for the further development and consolidation of the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Liu Xianguan, who became the director of the shipyard with the help of Soviet experts, said with emotion after seeing the communiqué: "The Soviet Union's help to us is endless. Thanks to the help of Soviet experts, the workers of our company have learned to build ships from not knowing how to build ships, and have learned to manage enterprises from not knowing how to manage enterprises. After the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company is managed by our country alone in the future, our responsibility will be even greater. We must seize the time and strive to learn advanced experience from Soviet experts." Tang Liyan, representative of the National People's Congress and foreman of the steel casting workshop of the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, said: "For several years, the Soviet army has been stationed in Lushunkou, protecting peace in the Far East; the Soviet Union has also sent a large number of experts to help our country with industrial construction; this Sino-Soviet talks has further consolidated and expanded the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. I work in the Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company and, like other Chinese workers, have received the cordial help of Soviet experts. They taught us new methods of steelmaking, which has increased the quality and output of steel in our workshop year by year. Now we must work harder to learn from the Soviet Union, improve our cultural and scientific and technological level, and meet new work tasks." The workers of Liu Lifu's advanced production team at the Lushun Factory held a discussion session on the same day. They talked about the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country, the consolidation of the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and the strength of the peace and democratic forces. The workers expressed their determination to step up learning from advanced Soviet production experience and contribute to the consolidation of the Lushunkou naval base with practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy.

After the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué was announced, many soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Luda immediately wrote letters to the Luda People's Daily, expressing their heartfelt support for the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué and expressing their determination to defend peace in the Far East. Li Tiefan, a soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Luda, said in his letter:

"The friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful guarantee for peace and security in the Far East and an important factor in maintaining world peace. In recent years, with the help of the Soviet Union, our country's economic construction and national defense construction have been rapidly developed. In order to continue to consolidate the Lushunkou naval base and defend the safety of the motherland and peace in Asia and the world, I must make unremitting efforts to learn advanced Soviet military science and technology, improve vigilance, and strengthen unity."

Farmers and fishermen were also elated and supported the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué. Sun Yongzhu, a member of the Xinlong Fishery Production Cooperative in Longwangtang Village, Sixth District, Lushun, said: "The Soviet army and we live together like friends. They not only defended peace in the Far East, but also helped the nearby residents. Like Kong Xianren in our cooperative, he encountered a storm while fishing at sea once and was about to fall into the water, but was rescued by the Soviet army. We will never forget the kindness of the Soviet army. Now the Soviet Union has expanded its assistance to our country. With this assistance, our country will build a socialist society faster!" Guo Wanfu, a member of the cooperative, said: "The people of Luda, who have lived under the oppression of Japanese imperialism for more than 40 years, expressed their strong support for the joint declaration of the governments of China and the Soviet Union on relations with Japan. The Japanese people should establish their own independent and free country. We resolutely oppose American imperialism oppressing the Japanese people and oppose the United States rearming Japan."

Shenyang City

The people of Shenyang City warmly support the communiqué on the Sino-Soviet talks. The employees of the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory construction site, which belongs to the 141 projects, are equipping the 1Д62 workshop with first-class technology and equipment. Wang Wenshan, representative of the National People's Congress and captain of the installation team of the workshop, is leading the installation work in the workshop. After hearing the good news, he said happily and gratefully: The Soviet Union's help to us is meticulous. This Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué has further encouraged our enthusiasm for building socialism. With the help of Soviet experts, we will surely overcome all difficulties, ensure quality, and complete the installation task ahead of schedule, and strive to start production as soon as possible. The tool workshop of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, one of the 141 projects, has been renovated and put into production with the help of Soviet experts. After listening to the broadcast, the workers of the sample group immediately held a discussion session. The old worker Zhang Zhongfu said: We thank the Soviet Union for giving us new and greater assistance. I must study the advanced Soviet experience well in the future and conscientiously implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. The farmers in the suburbs, who are in the midst of the tense autumn harvest, were elated when they heard the news of the Sino-Soviet talks. After receiving the newspaper on the same day, the members of the Nantaba Vegetable Production Cooperative gathered in the cafeteria to read it. As soon as the reading of the newspaper ended, the members said that the Soviet Union is really our elder brother, caring for us and helping us with our construction in every way. The staff of various government agencies, organizations, and schools in the city enthusiastically studied the communiqué on the Sino-Soviet talks. Wu Jingren, associate professor of the Pharmacology Teaching and Research Section of the China Medical University, said: In recent years, Soviet experts have often given us reports on medical academic, imparting the achievements of Soviet science and technology to us without reservation; after China and the Soviet Union signed the scientific and technological cooperation agreement, the Soviet Union will give us more help. He said that he will better study Soviet textbooks and teach the students well.

Chongqing City

The vast number of workers in Chongqing warmly support the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué. When the good news reached the 507 Power Plant, the workers cheered. Li Shaoqing, an old worker in the boiler workshop, said: "Our factory, from design and installation to power generation, was all completed under the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. Now the Soviet government is helping our country build 15 new industrial enterprises and expand the supply scope of the 141 enterprises stipulated in the original agreement. This is a powerful help for us to realize national industrialization. We must complete the production task with new achievements to thank the Soviet Union for its support. The Xia Haiqing group of the smelting team of the 101 Factory implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts better and improved the smelting quality. In order to express their gratitude to the Soviet Union, they ensured that the last furnace of steel on the same day would be tapped 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The workers of the weaving factory of the 601 Factory read and discussed the communiqué on the Sino-Soviet talks. They said: The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable, which proves that the Soviet Union's assistance to us is selfless. We must carry out labor emulation, save raw cotton, improve product quality, and use new achievements to thank the Soviet Union for its assistance.

When the students of a certain naval industrial university were eating breakfast, the loudspeaker broadcast the news of the upcoming announcement of the communiqué on the Sino-Soviet talks. The dining hall was immediately silent, and no one moved their bowls and chopsticks. When the communiqué was broadcast, the dining hall immediately cheered, and there were cheers and hugs everywhere. Zhang Guanwu, director of the Electrical Transmission Teaching and Research Section, immediately picked up his pen to write an article for the newspaper, and the first sentence said: "I celebrate the publication of the communiqué on the Sino-Soviet talks with tears of gratitude in my eyes and feelings of infinite excitement in my heart." The students spontaneously gathered to hold a discussion session. Li Ming, a student of the Civil Engineering Department who lives in Luda City, has personally seen the Soviet Union helping us with economic construction and has also seen the strength of the Soviet naval forces. He said: The fact that China and the Soviet Union agreed that the Soviet troops should withdraw from the jointly used Lushunkou naval base and that the base should be handed over to China for complete control fully proves the consolidation of our national defense forces. We must study harder and strive to liberate Taiwan and defend peace in the Far East.

专栏：

    各地人民热烈拥护中苏会谈公报
    北京市
    十二日上午十时左右，北京邮局汽车挂上写着庆祝中苏会谈公报字样的大幅标语，到各街道零售报纸，向全市人民报告喜讯。很多机关、工厂、学校都为这件喜事举行了座谈会、庆祝会。有些机关、学校的负责人发表了谈话。
      工厂的庆祝晚会
    石景山钢铁厂许多车间、石景山发电厂和北京市汽车运输公司等工厂举行了庆祝晚会。北京市劳动模范、石景山钢铁厂炼铁部二高炉值班工长侯德成说：“在我们国家恢复时期，苏联帮助了我们；在我们国家建设时期，苏联又帮助了我们。苏联对我们的帮助是真诚无私的。这次中苏会谈公报规定了苏联从经济、科学文化等方面帮助我们，将使我国更加顺利地完成国家过渡时期的总任务，早日实现社会主义工业化。”该厂动力部青年工人李聪智曾参观过鞍山钢铁公司，他说：“鞍钢的无缝钢管厂、自动化高炉等等，没有一个不是在苏联的帮助下建立起来的。有了苏联的无私帮助，将更加速我国社会主义工业化的建设。”石景山发电厂汽机车间助理技术员潘燕生拿到报纸后，就在工余时间给几个老工人念报。北京市劳动模范、该厂锅炉车间司炉梁增喜说：“苏联对咱们的关怀是无微不至的。为了感谢苏联政府和人民，我在生产上一定要更加努力。”
    民航公司的座谈会
    听到了关于中苏举行会谈的消息，中苏民用航空股份公司的工作人员，感到无限兴奋。
    十二日下午二时，公司经理部同志们举行了座谈会。他们一致表示：当中华人民共和国将成立时，苏联政府就和我国签订了创办中苏民用航空公司的协定，协助我国发展航空事业，加强中苏两国间的经济合作。四年来，在苏联专家的帮助下，公司年年超额完成生产指标。现在，当中苏民用航空公司的工作人员在各方面都有了进步，并已积累了必要的经验后，苏联政府就把苏联股份移交给我国。他们从亲身的体验中，感到苏联对中国人民的援助是无私的、是伟大的。见习机务工程师李贻渠在苏联专家的帮助下，已由机械员锻炼成为见习工程师。他说：四年来，只要我们有问题，苏联同志总是回答得那么具体。见习地面建筑工程师钱仁杰说：专家们出去检查工作，常常检查到每一个角落，使我们的经费支出没有一点浪费。商务科科长王孔修说：苏方管理处长每天很早去机场，看飞机起航。这种高度的责任心，是值得我们学习的。韩天凌说：我们的民航机四年来没有发生过事故。最近苏联专家又提出要延长机器检修的时间，节省汽油，使我们的成本更加降低。器材供应处处长范卜一说：苏联专家细心考虑每一块人民币的使用，器材计划制订得十分正确，既能保证供应，又能不积压。他还列举了许多例子，说明苏联工作同志们帮助我们发展民航事业的忘我的工作精神。大家一致认为现在更要抓紧时机，在两个多月内更好地总结工作经验，学习苏联先进经验，以担负起这一繁重的任务。
    石油工作者欢欣鼓舞
    中午，报纸到了中央燃料工业部石油管理总局，那里的工会立刻把中苏举行会谈的消息一次又一次地向全体工作人员进行了广播。在办公室、在饭厅，都有一群一群的人在围着读报。地质处处长职若愚说：“我非常兴奋地阅读了今天报纸上的消息。苏联援助我们的事实太多了，我越来越深刻地体会到苏联对我们的无私援助和亲切的关怀。今天报上发表的公报，又一次体现了苏联真诚的无私的友谊。我是从部队里来的，我特别感到掌握先进技术、学会管理现代化的企业，困难是很多的。当年青的我国面临着恢复国民经济时期，举办现代化的石油企业根本没有经验，苏联即根据平等互助的原则与我们合股创办了在新疆省开采和提炼石油的公司。它是一个设备完善的、现代化的企业。几年来苏联专家帮助我们培养了干部，积累了经验，现在又把这个企业中的苏联股份移交给我们了，这种友谊是无法比拟的，对我们石油工作者是一个很大的鼓舞。我们感到今后任务更加重大了，我们必须进一步认真地学习苏联先进经验，兢兢业业把这个企业管理好。”该局工会主席、办公室副主任柳永生说：“国民党统治时期，在新疆是用手工开采石油，解放后，苏联帮助我们在新疆创办了开采和提炼石油的近代化大企业，现在，这个合同还没有满期，苏联就把公司的苏联股份移交给我们了。苏联对我国这种深厚友谊实在太感动人了。我们一定要更积极地向苏联同志学习管理经验，积极准备力量，迎接新任务的到来。”
      科学家的喜悦
    我国著名的科学家怀着兴奋的心情阅读了“中苏关于签订科学技术合作协定的联合公报”。中国科学院植物研究所所长、生物学家钱崇澍在给本报的书面意见中说：解放以来，中国各方面的重大成就是和苏联给我们无私的援助分不开的，在科学方面也是如此。如米丘林学说、巴甫洛夫学说在今日中国生物学界中已开始成为一种指导思想，这种思想引导我国的生物研究工作在解放短短几年内得到了新的成就。中苏科学技术合作协定的签订，将使今后两国之间的科学技术交流更加经常化；这将促使我国的科学技术工作获得更多的成就，我国著名的工业大学清华大学副校长刘仙洲在给本报的来稿中写道：“中苏科学技术合作协定的签订不但对中苏两国人民，而且对全人类，都具有历史性的重大意义。因为，中苏两国科学技术的进一步合作一定会促进两国科学技术事业的蓬勃发展，而两国科学技术方面的任何新的成就，都将使世界和平力量得到进一步的加强。”铁道研究所所长茅以昇也对中苏科学技术合作协定的签订表示由衷的高兴，他说：在我国实行社会主义改造时期中，中苏科学技术合作协定的签订对我国是一项极大的鼓舞的力量；这样深厚的友谊是人类历史上从来没有过的。
  　中国科学院地球物理研究所所长赵九章说：我从事科学研究工作已经多年，看到这样无私的、真诚的、互相尊重的交换科学技术的成就还是第一次。地球物理研究所的地震研究工作在解放前的二十年中，在全国范围内只有一个台站四个干部，解放后，随着国家经济大规模的开展，地震科学工作有了极大的发展，大批的青年涌进这一科学领域，但随之而来的，在实际工作中碰到许多复杂的一时难以解决的理论和技术问题。在这样的情况下，苏联进一步的给我们这样无私的援助，我从内心感到无法抑止的兴奋。著名的物理学家王淦昌说：中国的物理研究工作，过去由于国民党反动派的百般摧残，一直没有能够得到发展，近年来，在党和政府的关怀下，工作有了新的成就，但我们从事物理研究工作的人时刻感到：目前的工作水平还远远跟不上国家的需要。无疑的，中苏科学技术合作协定的签订，将使我国物理研究工作大大向前提高一步，作为一个中国科学工作者，我要更好地向苏联的先进的科学虚心地学习。
    喜讯传到课堂
    北京师范大学的全体师生，对中苏两国政府的会谈公报极感兴奋。全国人民代表大会代表、北京师范大学校长陈垣，对这件事发表书面谈话。他说：“中苏举行会谈的公报，实在令人兴奋，令人感激。六十年前，我们的旅顺口就为帝国主义者强占，一直到伟大的抗日战争胜利，才回到劳动人民手里。我们感谢苏联政府在一九五二年接受了我国政府的提议，延长苏军从旅顺口撤退的期限，又在我国国防力量巩固的今天，议定苏军撤退并将该地区的设备无偿地移交我国政府。这样真诚无私的友谊，是我们中国人民永远难忘的。我们确信中苏两国人民的深切友谊是保卫远东及世界和平的万里长城，帝国主义者任何侵略阴谋，必将粉碎，我们一定能够获得更伟大的光辉的胜利。”
    中国人民大学的师生们一看到人民日报，大家就抢着阅读头版登载的关于中苏举行会谈的公报。许多师生都兴奋地发表了自己的感想和意见。法律系一年级同学中午看过报纸后，举行了座谈会。同学们对这个体现中苏伟大友谊的公报表现了无限的欢欣。大家一致认为，中苏两国的联合宣言说明了中苏两国一贯的和平外交政策。中苏两国的各项联合公报，都深深地表现了苏联对中国的伟大无私的帮助和关怀。中国人民大学国文教研室副教授汪金丁等兴奋地说：这公报不仅说明了中苏两国友谊关系的进一步发展，同时也说明了我国国防力量的日益巩固和增长。
    中央民族学院政治系的两个班举行了座谈会。他们有的来自黑龙江，有的来自康藏高原，他们每个人的心都深深地为这深厚的友谊打动了，他们一致表示：中苏会谈公报又一次表现了苏联对我国的援助，无比的真诚。回族学生王仲卿在这天不仅仔细地阅读了公报，而且特别重温了毛主席的著作“最伟大的友谊”，他说：苏联对我国的援助，又一次鼓舞了我国各族人民建设社会主义的信心。
    铁路职工提高了信心
    铁路职工热烈拥护中苏会谈公报。北京西站三十多名职工举行了座谈会。铁道部新线工程总局设计总局基本建设局的工程技术人员也座谈了他们的感想。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的工人们，争着买当天的报纸。在内蒙草原上修筑集宁到乌兰巴托铁路的数万职工，在沿线工地集体收听关于中苏会谈公报的广播。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂“二七”老工人陈伍德说：“中国有苏联这样的好朋友，什么困难也挡得住。苏联对我国这样全面的无私的援助必然会促使我国社会主义社会早日到来。”
    许多工程技术人员都知道：修建兰州到阿拉木图和集宁到乌兰巴托这两条铁路是非常艰巨的。从兰州到新疆边境要通过大戈壁沙漠、翻浆地带和无人烟的大草原，气候很特殊，夏天夜晚还要穿皮衣，沿线水源也非常缺乏。集宁到蒙古人民共和国边界都是沙漠地带和草原地带，气候很干燥，水也缺乏。在这些地方修筑铁路，过去是不可想像的。新线工程总局工程师张大镛看到中苏会谈公报上说的苏联政府将给予我国政府全面的技术援助后，信心增加了百倍。他说：“我参观了苏联展览馆的电气机车以后，就提高了对于修建兰新路和集二线的信心，看到中苏会谈公报以后，信心更加强了，我们一定按照国家计划按期修好这两条铁路。”为了保证这两条铁路的质量，许多工程师表示一定要加强学习苏联先进经验。
    修筑兰新路的职工们纷纷表示，要早日修通兰新铁路。劳动模范张松年正在设计铺轨机，他表示尽快地把铺轨机设计好，交给钉道队使用，并努力推广小型机械化施工方法，争取早日把钢轨铺到乌鲁木齐。西北设计分局老工程师张同顺，今年六十多岁了，他看到公报以后非常兴奋，他说：“这条铁路担负着国际运输的重要责任，对我国经济建设有重大意义。现在苏联援助我们的机器，都是从东北的满洲里运来的；将来就可以直接经由乌鲁木齐运到西北来。”他表示在勘测设计工作中要认真贯彻苏联专家建议，多调查研究，保证这条铁路设计质量良好。参加武威、玉门段勘测工作的技术人员表示，保证按时供给资料。在古浪峡工程现场的工人们，听到中苏会谈的公报以后，一致表示：更好地推行苏联大爆破的经验，把古浪峡炸开一条平坦大道，让兰新铁路迅速铺过去。
    旅大市
    旅大人民以无比兴奋和感激的心情拥护关于中苏举行会谈的公报。
    中苏造船公司的职工和整日相处的苏联专家一起，欢呼中苏两国人民的友谊进一步发展和巩固。在苏联专家帮助下，由工人成为造船厂厂长的刘宪官看到公报后感动地说：“苏联对我们的帮助是说不完的。由于苏联专家的帮助，我们公司的工人从不会造船学会了造船，从不会管理企业学会了管理企业。中苏造船公司将来由我国单独管理以后，我们的责任就更加重大，我们一定要抓紧时间，努力向苏联专家学习先进经验。”全国人民代表大会代表、中苏造船公司铸钢厂工段长唐立言说：“几年来，苏联驻军旅顺口，保卫了远东的和平；苏联并派大批专家帮助我国进行工业建设；这次中苏会谈，更进一步巩固和扩大了中苏两国人民的友谊。我在中苏造船公司工作，和其他中国工人一样，得到了苏联专家的亲切帮助。他们教给我们新的熔钢方法，使我们工段的钢水的质量和产量逐年提高。现在我们要更加努力向苏联学习，提高文化和科学技术水平，迎接新的工作任务。”旅顺工厂刘立富先进生产小组的工人们当天举行了座谈会，他们谈到苏联对我国无私的援助，谈到中苏两国人民友谊的巩固与和平民主力量的强大。工人们纷纷表示决心，要加紧学习苏联先进生产经验，用增产节约的实际行动，为巩固旅顺口海军根据地而贡献力量。
    中苏会谈公报公布以后，旅大市内不少解放军战士立即写信给旅大人民日报社，表示衷心拥护中苏会谈公报，并表示了他们捍卫远东和平的决心。中国人民解放军驻旅大某部战士李铁凡的信中说：
  “中苏两国的友好合作是远东和平和安全的有力保证，是维护世界和平的重要因素。几年来，在苏联的帮助下，我国的经济建设和国防建设得到了迅速的发展。为了继续巩固旅顺口海军根据地，捍卫祖国安全和亚洲及世界和平，我要不懈地努力学习苏联先进军事科学技术，提高警惕，加强团结。”
    农民和渔民们也都欢欣鼓舞，拥护中苏会谈公报。旅顺第六区龙王塘村新龙渔业生产合作社社员孙永珠说：“苏军和我们像朋友一样生活在一起。他们不仅保卫了远东的和平，同时也帮助了附近的居民。像我们合作社里的孔宪仁，有一次他在海里捕鱼遇上了风暴，眼看就要落水，幸而被苏军救出来。我们永远忘不了苏军的恩情。现在苏联又扩大了对我国的帮助，有了这些帮助，我国建设社会主义社会就更快了！”该社社员郭万富说：“曾经在日本帝国主义压迫下生活了四十多年的旅大人民，对中苏两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言表示非常拥护。日本人民应该建立起自己的独立自由的国家，我们坚决反对美国帝国主义压迫日本人民，反对美国重新武装日本。”
