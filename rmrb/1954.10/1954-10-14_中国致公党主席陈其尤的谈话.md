Recently, the government delegations of China and the Soviet Union held talks in Beijing on Sino-Soviet relations and the international situation. Afterwards, a communique on the Sino-Soviet talks was issued on the 12th of this month, which once again made us deeply appreciate the greatness of the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The brotherly and selfless assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people to our country is an important factor in the great achievements our country has made in economic recovery, socialist construction, and socialist transformation over the past five years, as has been proven by facts. Today, the Soviet Union has further demonstrated its lofty friendship to us. We express our heartfelt gratitude and infinite excitement for this selfless assistance from the Soviet government and the Soviet people! The help we have received from the Soviet government is truly immense. The Soviet government will withdraw Soviet troops from the jointly used Sino-Soviet naval base in Lushunkou before May 31st next year, and transfer all the equipment of the Lushunkou military port to our country free of charge; the Soviet government will transfer the Soviet shares of the four Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies to our country; the Soviet government will assist our country with new scientific and technological knowledge and provide our country with a long-term loan of 520 million rubles; and will provide practical assistance to our country in the construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway. All of this assistance is of inestimable value to our country's socialist construction.

The Joint Declaration of China and the Soviet Union and the Joint Declaration on Relations with Japan once again demonstrate the firm and consistent peaceful diplomatic policies of China and the Soviet Union, making a great appeal to the cause of international peace and opening up a broad path; at the same time, they express deep concern for the national interests and peaceful and democratic life of the Japanese people. Only peace-loving countries like China and the Soviet Union can have such a frank and magnanimous attitude.

From the communique of the Sino-Soviet talks, we more clearly realize that the responsibility we bear for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world will become increasingly important in the future. The people of our country should unite more closely around the great Chinese Communist Party and strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the construction of our great socialist motherland!

    中国致公党主席陈其尤的谈话
    最近中苏两国政府代表团在北京就中苏关系和国际形势的问题举行了会谈，会后并于本月十二日发表了关于中苏举行会谈的公报，使我们又一次深切地体会到中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊的伟大。苏联政府和苏联人民对我国兄弟般的无私的援助，是我国五年来在经济恢复工作及社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中取得伟大成就的一个重要因素，这已为事实所证明。今天，苏联更进一步对我们表现了崇高的友谊。我们对苏联政府和苏联人民这种无私的援助表示衷心的感谢和无限的兴奋！我们从苏联政府得到的帮助真是太大了。苏联政府将于明年五月三十一日以前从中苏共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地撤退苏军，并将旅顺口军港的一切设备无偿地移交我国；苏联政府将以四个中苏合办的股份公司的苏联股份移交给我国；苏联政府将以新科学技术知识协助我国，和给予我国五亿二千万卢布的长期贷款；并将在修建兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路上给予我国以实际帮助。所有这一切帮助，对于我国社会主义建设事业是具有不可估计的价值的。
    中苏两国联合宣言和关于对日本关系的联合宣言，再一次说明了中苏两国坚定的一贯的和平外交政策，对国际和平事业作了巨大的号召和开辟了广阔的道路；同时表示了对日本人民民族利益和和平民主生活深切的关怀。这种光明磊落的态度，只有像中苏这样爱好和平的国家才可能有的。
    我们从中苏这次会谈的公报中，更清楚地认识到我们今后对保卫亚洲及世界和平所担负的责任将越来越重大，我们全国人民应该更紧密地团结在伟大的中国共产党的周围，为解放台湾和建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国而奋斗！
