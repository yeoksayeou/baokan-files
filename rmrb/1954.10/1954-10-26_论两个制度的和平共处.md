    On the Peaceful Coexistence of Two Systems
    Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, E. Varga
    The most important characteristic of the present era is the existence in the world of two different social systems – the socialist system and the capitalist system, each with its inherent internal laws of development. The great October Socialist Revolution in Russia in 1917 created a new system of social relations – the socialist system. After World War II, some countries in Central and Southeastern Europe embarked on the path of socialist development, and in 1949, the state of the great Chinese people also embarked on the path of socialist development.
    An economic, scientific, technological, literary, and artistic competition is taking place between the two systems – the socialist system and the capitalist system; an ideological struggle is being waged to sway people's views and human beliefs. The most important task for all who cherish human life and human culture is not to allow the peaceful competition and ideological struggle to turn into an armed struggle. This task can undoubtedly be solved, because only a negligible minority desires and benefits from war. Even in the capitalist world, the vast majority of residents do not want war and understand the dangerous consequences of a new world war in light of modern military technology and the possession of weapons of mass destruction. The question of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between the two systems is one of the fundamental questions of our time.
    Rich historical experience proves that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully for a long time.
    Throughout human history, two different social systems have coexisted for long periods: the feudal system coexisted with the slave society, and the capitalist system coexisted with feudalism. In most cases, wars occurred between countries with the same or similar social systems. Wars that occurred to change the social system of a certain country were relatively rare, and such attempts mostly came from the side of the declining social system, often resulting in disastrous defeats. The war of the European monarchical alliance against the French bourgeois republic at the end of the 18th century – a war aimed at restoring the monarchical feudal order – was of this nature; the armed intervention of imperialism against the Soviet Republic in the first years of its existence was also of this nature.
    Of course, the difference between the capitalist system and the socialist system is much greater than the difference between the various systems before socialism. Slave systems, feudal systems, and capitalist systems are of the same type in this respect: under these social forms, the means of production are privately owned. At the same time, on this basis, the majority of the labor products of the direct producers – slaves, serfs, hired workers – are seized by the ruling class, the owners of the means of production. This commonality allows different modes of production to even coexist within the same country. Capitalist enterprises developed within feudal society; in the United States, serfdom legally existed within the capitalist system until 1865. Remnants of feudalism – and occasionally remnants of slavery – are still preserved in many bourgeois countries today.
    Capitalism and socialism are social forms of different types. Under the capitalist system, the means of production are private property; under the socialist system, the means of production are public property. The capitalist system means the exploitation of the working masses by capitalists and landlords; the socialist system means the elimination of all forms of exploitation of man by man. Under the capitalist system, the purpose of production is to obtain maximum profit. Under the socialist system, the purpose of production is to fully meet the needs of the entire society. The capitalist system is inseparable from anarchy of production and economic crises. The economy under the socialist system develops according to plan and without crises.
    The capitalist system has developed productive forces to a considerable extent. However, the capitalist social system has long been unable to adapt to the level of development that productive forces have reached. Periodic crises of overproduction, frequent underutilization of enterprises, massive unemployment, and forced contraction of production all vividly demonstrate this point. For example, in the United States, the government forces farmers to greatly reduce the area of wheat fields and many other crops. At the same time, millions upon millions of people on earth are starving.
    Under the capitalist system, the purchasing power of the masses is increasingly lagging behind productive capacity. Under the socialist system, the increase in social purchasing power proceeds simultaneously with the increase in production.
    Therefore, the internal laws of development of the capitalist system and the socialist system are completely different.
    Despite their different internal laws, however, there is no reason to believe that the two systems cannot coexist peacefully for a long time.
    Both the capitalist and socialist parts of the world are equally concerned with the development of international trade. Since the end of World War II, the development of this trade, based on mutual benefit, has been hampered by the discriminatory policies of the United States. The United States not only does not trade with the countries of the socialist camp itself, but also influences the trade policies of other capitalist countries in this regard, causing them significant losses.
    Some say that the proportion of foreign trade of Russia and China in world trade has always been small. But this statement is unfounded. It is well known that the more developed a country's economy is, the more multifaceted its production will be, and the more extensive its foreign economic ties will be. Highly developed industrial countries, such as Britain and Germany, have always been the best customers for each other's goods. Therefore, one must never infer the possible amount of foreign trade that can be achieved now or in the future based on the past situation of Russia and China. The rapid economic development and industrialization process of socialist countries creates the most favorable opportunities for expanding their trade with capitalist countries, as long as the artificial barriers hindering normal trade between the two world markets can be removed.
    Providing practical economic assistance to backward countries provides a wide scope for international economic cooperation. However, capitalist countries are only concerned with keeping backward countries economically backward forever, maintaining colonial exploitation of these countries to use them as sources of cheap raw materials and markets where they can sell products at high prices. As for the Soviet Union, it is concerned with the comprehensive economic development of backward countries. The Soviet Union is prepared to promote this development in various ways – technical assistance, supply of means of production (including complete sets of equipment for entire factories), granting favorable payment terms, and concluding long-term agreements to purchase goods from backward countries at fixed prices. Therefore, making every effort to develop trade ties with the countries of the socialist camp is of great benefit to backward countries.
    The development of international trade has historically been an important factor in promoting international peace.
    Peaceful coexistence also opens up broad scope for the development of cultural exchanges between countries with different social systems. The cultures of these countries, despite having significant differences due to the different social systems, still have commonalities, because they all utilize the cultural heritage of all mankind. Young people everywhere are studying the same laws of nature. The names of Newton, Darwin, Einstein, and Curie are as respected in our country as the names of Lobachevsky, Mendeleev, Pavlov, and Michurin are respected among the people in capitalist countries. In the Soviet Union, familiarity with Homer and Dante, Shakespeare and Goethe, Balzac and France is as much a sign of a person's high culture as familiarity with Pushkin and Gogol, Tolstoy and Gorky is in capitalist countries. In socialist countries, hearing the music of Bach and Beethoven, Verdi and Bizet is as satisfying as hearing the music of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, and Shostakovich is in capitalist countries. Cultured people all over the world should understand that a third world war is a threat to the continued existence of thousands of years of culture. In order to safeguard everything valuable created by mankind, peaceful coexistence is necessary.
    Those who oppose the peaceful coexistence of the two systems insist that it seems that the Soviet Union intends to overthrow the capitalist system in other countries by means of war. This is simply a sinister and malicious lie.
    We Marxists certainly know that the capitalist system, the capitalist mode of production, like the slave system and the feudal system before it, is a transitional form in the social historical development. We know that the internal laws of capitalism will inevitably lead it to its demise. The history of the last hundred years has vividly proved the correctness of Marxist doctrine. Today, the socialist camp already has nine hundred million people, exceeding more than one-third of the world's population.
    But Marxists have never forgotten that in any country, the socialist transformation of society can only be realized when all the necessary objective and subjective conditions have matured within that country, and only the people themselves can decide their own destiny. Lenin said that the theory of "inciting revolution" in other countries is contrary to Marxism, and Marxism always denies the theory of "inciting" revolution, because revolution develops with the intensification of class contradictions that produce revolution. Stalin succinctly pointed out: "Exporting revolution – that's nonsense."
    Some facts from the post-war years have proven this point. For example, the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the failure of American imperialism are certainly the result of the action of internal forces within this great country. Even the mortal enemies of socialism, the enemies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, admit this. For example, former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson wrote in the preface to the collection of American documents (White Paper) on China:
    "Our military observers in China have reported that the Nationalist army (referring to the Kuomintang bandit army)... has not suffered a single battle failure due to a lack of weapons and ammunition. ... Its troops have lost their fighting spirit, and its government has lost the support of the people."
                ×　×　×
    Representatives of narrow, yet powerful, groups within capitalist countries who are keen on exacerbating international tensions – large monopoly capitalists, arms manufacturers, generals greedy for military merit, etc. – arbitrarily say that it is the socialist camp, first and foremost the Soviet Union, that threatens peace.
    This statement is purely a lie.
    The leaders of the Soviet Union have always advocated the peaceful coexistence of the two systems – this has been the foundation of Soviet foreign policy since the founding of the country. In the nearly forty years of the Soviet Union's existence, it has had to repeatedly fight back against foreign aggressors who invaded its territory, but the great Soviet state has never attacked any country.
    There is no such group of people in the Soviet Union who can gain any economic benefits from war hysteria and war. War propaganda is subject to legal sanctions in the Soviet Union.
    The leaders of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc have reluctantly admitted the fact that the Soviet Union's foreign policy follows a policy of peace. In the year that this bloc was established – 1949 – they said that Western Europe must quickly arm itself, because it supposedly did not have any strength at that time to prevent an attack from the Soviet Union. But five years later, the Supreme Commander of the armed forces of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc in Europe, U.S. General Gruenther, boasted in mid-1954 that the military strength of Western Europe has now grown to the point where it no longer needs to fear an invasion by the Soviet army. One cannot help but ask: If the Soviet Union really had aggressive intentions towards Western Europe, then why did it not start a war when Western Europe had no defense capabilities at all – this is according to the enemy's claim?
    The Soviet Union has provided irrefutable evidence of its peaceful intentions: it has put forward proposals on establishing a collective security system, reducing armaments, and banning weapons of mass destruction. At the same time, the West is continuing the arms race and pursuing the dangerous policy of remilitarizing West Germany, to arm the forces of German imperialism that have twice provoked world wars in the first half of this century.
    Obviously, this is not for "defending Europe," but for preparing for a war of aggression.
    The Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp, by the nature of their social systems, are fundamentally incompatible with intentions of foreign expansion and aggression. Those economic factors that prompt capitalist countries to invade other countries are not at play in the countries of the socialist camp. These countries do not need to seize foreign lands in order to ensure sales markets for their products, nor do they need to forcibly occupy foreign sources of raw materials. They are able to meet all their growing needs by developing their own abundant internal resources. And in order to fully develop their resources, they need lasting peace.
    The reason why the Soviet Union and the various countries of the socialist camp advocate peace is not because they are weak, nor because they are afraid of the power of the United States. World War II has clearly demonstrated the power of the Soviet Union. This power is built on advanced technology, the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet peoples, and Soviet patriotism. Now, the Soviet Union possesses all kinds of the most modern weapons, has the other countries of the socialist camp as loyal allies, and enjoys the support of millions upon millions of working people in the capitalist world – especially in colonial and semi-colonial countries. The Soviet Union has the strength to inflict a devastating blow on any aggressor.
    The Soviet Union has consistently implemented and is implementing a policy of peace in the international arena. Now, considering the detrimental impact of a new world war on all of humanity – especially today, when new types of weapons of mass destruction already exist – the leaders and people of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies advocate resolving outstanding international political issues peacefully.
    It is not the Soviet Union or China that threatens the peaceful coexistence of the two systems, but powerful groups in capitalist countries – especially the United States – which actually deny the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the two systems. There are some powerful groups in the United States who not only advocate a "policy of strength," but also advocate an immediate "preventive" war against the countries of the socialist camp. An example of this can be found in the statement made by U.S. Navy Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Carney on May 27, 1954. He said:
    "The question is this: Do we want to take the smooth (compromising) road and enter a dead end, or do we take the more rugged road that can lead us in the right direction – if we have the strength and courage?"
    It may be considered that this is Admiral Carney's personal opinion. But according to the "New York Times" of May 28, the full text of his speech had been agreed to in advance by the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense.
    Admiral Carney's call for a "preventive" war is not an isolated phenomenon. There are many powerful figures in the United States who openly advocate such a criminal approach, such as Senators McCarthy and Nolan, Admiral Radford, General MacArthur, Prelite, and others. As is well known, American officials opposed the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue, advocated "internationalizing" this war, suggested dropping atomic bombs on the army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that was then surrounding Dien Bien Phu, and advocated expanding the Indochina war and turning it into a world war.
    The military authorities of the United States and Britain often make estimates of the armed forces of the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp, attempting to prove the aggressive intentions of this camp by revealing the fact that this camp possesses these armed forces. But this propaganda trick cannot conceal the truth. People have seen that the United States is establishing naval and air military bases, batch after batch, around the countries of the socialist camp, thousands of kilometers away from its own country. Some countries bordering the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, in violation of the wishes of their own people, have been dragged into military alliances, armed, and turned into military offensive bases for the United States. In this situation, can the countries of the socialist camp not build up their own armed forces to prevent the threat of foreign invasion?
    For the sake of peaceful coexistence, the Soviet Union has more than once proposed greatly reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons, but until now, its proposals have been rejected by capitalist powers. The Soviet Union's proposal on establishing a system to ensure peace and collective security – a system in which all countries with different social systems can participate – has also been strongly opposed.
    Therefore, it is not the Soviet Union that threatens peaceful coexistence, but the aggressive policy of the United States, a policy that is not for the benefit of the peace-loving American people, but for the benefit of a small group of monopoly capitalists. At the same time, for American imperialism, establishing military alliances and establishing military bases in other capitalist countries is also a means of strengthening the position of the United States in the entire capitalist world. Under the guise of "common defense against communism," American imperialism attempts to deprive all other capitalist countries of their sovereignty and independence, in order to subordinate them to itself.
                ×　×　×
    Despite all the tricks played by American imperialism, the idea of peaceful coexistence of the two systems is becoming increasingly popular within the capitalist world. The aggressive foreign policy of the United States is suffering setbacks time and time again.
    America's European allies rejected the American government's proposal to "internationalize" the Vietnam War (according to the Korean model). The infamous "European Defense Community" also suffered a disastrous defeat. Southeast Asian countries such as India, Ceylon, Indonesia, and Burma (which have nearly half a billion people) refused to participate in the military alliance of the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty" cobbled together by the United States. This aggressive alliance has been firmly condemned by the six hundred million Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries.
    Level-headed politicians in Western European countries are increasingly firmly opposed to the American policy of establishing aggressive blocs, and in favor of peaceful coexistence between the two systems. The people of Asia are particularly strongly in favor of peaceful coexistence. In the talks between the Premier of the People's Republic of China and the Prime Minister of India, as well as with the Prime Minister of Burma, five principles were stipulated – mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These countries believe that these principles are necessary as the basis for establishing mutual relations between them. These principles can also serve as the basis for the peaceful coexistence of all countries – regardless of their social systems.
                ×　×　×
    The peaceful coexistence of the two systems is entirely possible, because the vast majority of people in the world yearn for peace. Only a very small minority – the warmongers – want to drag the whole world into the flames of a new world war that threatens the survival of humanity itself. Peaceful coexistence is not only possible, but also absolutely necessary for the benefit of all mankind.

    论两个制度的和平共处
    苏联科学院院士  埃·瓦尔加
    当代最主要的特点，是世界上存在着两种不同的社会制度——各有其固有的内部发展法则的社会主义制度和资本主义制度。一九一七年俄国的伟大的十月社会主义革命创立了新的社会关系的制度——社会主义制度。在第二次世界大战以后，中欧和东南欧的一些国家走上了社会主义发展的道路，而在一九四九年，伟大的中国人民的国家也走上了社会主义发展的道路。
    在两种制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度之间，进行着经济、科学、技术、文学和艺术各方面的竞赛；进行着左右人们的观点和人类信仰的思想斗争。所有珍视人类生活和人类文化的人的最重要任务，就是不容许把和平的竞赛和思想斗争变成为武装的斗争。这种任务无疑是可以解决的，因为希望战争和与战争有利害关系的人只是微不足道的少数。即使在资本主义世界，绝大多数居民也不愿意战争，而且了解到，在现代的军事技术的情况下，在拥有大规模的杀人武器的情况下，新的世界大战会带来怎样危险的后果。两个制度之间的和平共处和合作的问题，是当代的基本问题之一。
    丰富的历史经验证明，不同社会制度的国家是可以长期和平共处的。
    在人类历史上，很长时期内都是同时存在着两种不同的社会制度：和奴隶社会同时存在的有封建制度，和封建主义同时存在的有资本主义制度。在绝大多数的情况下，战争是发生在具有同样或类似的社会制度的国家之间的。为了改变某一国家的社会制度而发生的战争是比较稀少的，而且这种企图多半是来自衰颓着的社会制度这一方面，其结果也往往是惨败的。十八世纪末的欧洲君主国同盟反对法国资产阶级共和国的战争——这次战争的目的是使得君主封建秩序复辟——就具有这种性质；在苏维埃共和国存在的最初几年内帝国主义对它进行的武装干涉也具有这种性质。
    当然，资本主义制度和社会主义制度之间的差别比社会主义以前各种制度之间的差别要大的多。奴隶制度、封建制度和资本主义制度在这个方面是同一类型的：在这些社会形态下，生产资料是属于私人所有的。同时在这种基础上直接生产者——奴隶、农奴、雇佣工人——的大部分劳动产品被统治阶级、生产资料所有者攫为己有。这种共同性使不同的生产方式甚至共存在同一个国家之内。资本主义的企业是在封建社会内部发展起来的；在美国，直到一八六五年农奴制还合法地存在于资本主义制度之内。封建制度的残余——间或也有奴隶制度的残余——至今还在许多资产阶级国家保存着。
    资本主义和社会主义是不同类型的社会形态。在资本主义制度下生产资料是私人的财产，在社会主义制度下生产资料是公共财产。资本主义制度意味着资本家和地主对劳动大众的剥削；社会主义制度则是消灭人对人的各种剥削。在资本主义制度下，生产的目的是获取最高利润。而在社会主义制度下的生产目的是最充分地满足整个社会的需要。资本主义制度与生产的无政府状态和经济危机是分不开的。社会主义制度下的经济是按照计划并且是没有危机地发展着的。
    资本主义制度在颇大程度上发展了生产力。但是资本主义社会制度早已不能适合生产力所已达到的发展水平。周期性的生产过剩危机、企业的经常开工不足、大量的失业、生产的强制减缩，都鲜明地证明了这点。例如在美国，政府就强制农民大大减缩麦田和其他许多农作物的面积。与此同时，地球上却有千千万万的人在挨饿。
    在资本主义制度下，人民大众的购买力越来越落在生产能力之后。在社会主义制度下社会购买力的提高是和生产的提高同时并进的。
    因此，资本主义制度和社会主义制度的内部发展法则是截然不同的。
    尽管它们的内部法则不同，然而，没有任何理由可以认为这两种制度不能长期和平共处。
    世界上的资本主义部分和社会主义部分同样都关心国际贸易的发展。自从第二次世界大战结束以来，以互利为基础的这种贸易的发展，遭到了美国歧视政策的阻碍。美国不仅自己不和社会主义阵营的国家进行贸易，而且在这方面还影响着其他资本主义国家的贸易政策，使它们受到了重大损失。
    有人说，俄国和中国的对外贸易在世界贸易中所占的比重一直是不大的。但是这种说法是没有根据的。大家都知道，一个国家的经济越是发达，它的生产就越具有更加多方面的性质，它的对外经济联系也就会更加扩大。高度发展的工业国家，例如英国和德国，彼此一直都是商品的最好的顾客。因此决不能根据过去的俄国和中国的情况来推断现在或将来的可能达到的对外贸易量。社会主义国家的经济的迅速发展和工业化过程，为扩大它们同资本主义国家的贸易创造了最有利的机会，只要阻碍这两个世界市场之间的正常贸易的人为障碍能够消除的话。
    对落后国家进行实际的经济援助，为国际经济合作提供了广泛的范围。但资本主义国家所关心的，只是使落后国家永远保持经济的落后性，保持对这些国家的殖民地剥削以使它们作为廉价原料的来源和能够以高价推销产品的市场。至于苏联，它所关心的是落后国家的经济的全面发展。苏联准备以各种方法——技术援助、供给生产资料（包括整个工厂的全套装备）、给予优厚的支付条件和缔结按照固定的价格购买落后国家的货物的长期协定来促进这种发展。因此，尽力发展和社会主义阵营各国的贸易联系，对于落后国家是有巨大好处的。
    国际贸易的发展在历史上一向就是促进国际和平的一个重要因素。
    和平共处也为发展各种不同社会制度的国家之间的文化交流打开了广阔的范围。这些国家的文化，尽管由于社会制度的不同而有着重大的区别，可是仍有其共同之点，因为它们都利用着全人类的文化遗产。各处的青年们都在研究着同样的自然法则。牛顿、达尔文、爱因斯坦和居里的名字，在我国所受到的尊敬，也就像洛巴契夫斯基、门得列也夫、巴甫洛夫和米邱林的名字在资本主义国家的人民那里所受到的尊敬一样。在苏联，熟悉荷马和但丁、莎士比亚和歌德、巴尔扎克和法朗士，也就像在资本主义各国熟悉普希金和果戈理、托尔斯泰和高尔基一样，都是人们具有高度文化的标志。在社会主义国家，听到巴哈和贝多芬、浮第和比才的音乐，也就像在资本主义国家里听到柴柯夫斯基、拉赫马尼诺夫和萧斯塔科维奇的音乐是一样满意的。全世界有文化的人都应当理解到，第三次世界大战是对数千来年所创造的文化的继续存在的威胁。为了维护人类所创造的一切有价值的东西，必需和平共处。
    反对两种制度和平共处的人们硬说，好像苏联打算用战争的方法来推翻其他国家的资本主义制度。这简直是心怀叵测的和恶毒的谎言。
    我们马克思主义者当然知道，资本主义制度、资本主义的生产方式像在它以前的奴隶制度和封建制度一样，是社会历史发展中的一个过渡形式。我们知道，资本主义的内部法则将不可避免地把它导向灭亡。近一百年来的历史鲜明地证明了马克思主义学说的正确性。今天社会主义阵营已经拥有九亿人民，超过了全世界人口的三分之一以上。
    但是马克思主义者从来没有忘记：在任何一个国家中，社会的社会主义改造只能在一切必要的客观条件和主观条件都已在这个国家内部成熟的时候才能实现，只有人民自己才能决定自己的命运。列宁说过，在其他国家“煽动革命”的理论是与马克思主义背道而驰的，马克思主义永远是否认“煽动”革命的理论，因为革命是随着产生革命的阶级矛盾的尖锐化程度而发展的。斯大林扼要地指出了：“输出革命—这是胡说。”
    战后年代的一些事实已证明了这一点。例如，中国人民革命的胜利和美国帝国主义的失败，当然是这个伟大国家内部力量作用的结果。即使社会主义的死敌、苏联和中华人民共和国的敌人也都承认这点。例如，美国前任国务卿艾奇逊在有关中国的美国文件集（白皮书）的序言中曾写道：
    “我们在中国的军事观察家曾报告说，国军（指国民党匪军）……没有一次战役的失败是由于缺乏武器和弹药。……它的部队已经丧失了斗志，它的政府已经失去了人民的支持。”
                ×　×　×
    资本主义国家内热中于加剧国际紧张局势的狭隘的、然而很有势力的集团的代表——大垄断资本家、军火制造商、贪图战功的将军等人，武断说威胁和平的是社会主义阵营，首先是苏联。
    这种说法纯粹是谎言。
    苏联的领袖们一向主张两种制度的和平共处——这是苏联从立国以来的外交政策的基础。在苏联存在的将近四十年的历史中，它曾不得不一再地反击侵犯它的领土的外国侵略者，但是伟大的苏维埃国家从来也没有进攻过任何国家。
    在苏联没有这样一部分人：他们可以在战争歇斯底里和战争中得到什么经济上的好处。战争宣传在苏联是要受到法律制裁的。
    北大西洋侵略集团的领导者们，曾经心不由衷地承认了苏联的对外政策遵循和平方针的事实。在这个集团成立的那一年——一九四九年，他们说西欧必须赶快武装起来，因为据说那时它没有防止来自苏联方面的进攻的任何力量。而在五年以后，北大西洋侵略集团在欧洲的武装部队的最高统帅、美国将军格伦瑟却在一九五四年年中吹嘘说，西欧的军事力量现在已经成长到毋须再害怕苏联军队侵犯的程度了。不禁要问一下：如果苏联对西欧真的怀有侵略意图，那么为什么它不在西欧还没有任何防御能力的时候——这是照敌人的说法——就开始战争呢？
    苏联提供了它具有和平意愿的无可辩驳的证据：它曾提出了关于建立集体安全体系、裁减军备、禁止大规模杀人的武器的建议。而与此同时，西方却在继续进行军备竞赛，奉行使西德重新军国主义化的危险政策，去武装那曾经在本世纪上半叶内两度挑起世界大战的德国帝国主义的力量。
    显然，这不是为了“保卫欧洲”，而是为了准备侵略战争。
    苏联和社会主义阵营的其他国家一样，按其社会制度的性质本身来说，和对外扩张与侵略的意图是根本水火不相容的。那些促使资本主义国家去侵略别国的经济上的因素，在社会主义阵营国家中是不起作用的。这些国家，没有必要为了保证自己产品的销售市场而去侵占外国的土地，也没有必要去强占外国的原料产地。它们能够通过发展内部丰富资源的途径来满足自己不断增长的一切需要。而为了充分发展自己的资源，它们就需要持久的和平。
    苏联和社会主义阵营各个国家之所以拥护和平，并不是因为它们软弱，也不是因为它们害怕美国的力量。第二次世界大战已经清楚地证明了苏联的威力。这种威力是建立在先进的技术、苏联各族人民在精神上和政治上的一致和苏维埃爱国主义的基础上的。现在，苏联已拥有各种最现代化的武器，有社会主义阵营的其他各国作为忠实的盟国，并且得到资本主义世界——特别是殖民地与半殖民地国家——千千万万劳动人民的支持。苏联是有力量给予任何侵略者以歼灭性的打击的。
    苏联在国际间始终如一地执行了与执行着和平政策。现在，考虑到新的世界大战对于全体人类会有何等有害的影响——特别是在已经有了大规模毁灭性的新型武器的今天——苏联与人民民主国家的领袖们和人民，都主张以和平方式来解决悬而未决的国际政治问题。
    威胁着两个制度和平共处的并不是苏联或中国，而是资本主义国家——特别是美国的有势力集团，这些集团实际上否认两个制度和平共处的可能性。在美国有一些有势力的集团，它们不仅主张“实力政策”，而且主张对社会主义阵营国家立即进行“预防性”的战争。这可以用美国海军作战部长卡涅海军上将在一九五四年五月二十七日的声明作为例子。他说：
      “问题是这样的：我们是希望走平坦的（妥协的）道路因而进入死巷呢，还是走比较崎岖的然而能够引导我们到正确方向去——如果我们有力量和勇气的话——的道路呢？”
    不妨认为这是海军上将卡涅个人的意见。但是据五月二十八日的“纽约时报”透露说，他的演说全文在事先是被美国国务院和国防部所同意的。
    卡涅海军上将号召进行“预防性”战争，这并不是孤立的现象。在美国有不少有势力的人物也公开提倡这样的罪恶方式，如参议员麦卡锡与诺兰，海军上将雷德福，麦克阿瑟将军，普立特及其他等人。如所周知，美国执政人士反对印度支那问题的和平解决，主张把这个战争“国际化”，建议对当时包围着奠边府的越南民主共和国军队投掷原子弹，主张扩大印度支那战争，使它变为世界大战。
    美国和英国的军事主管机关常常对苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的武装力量作出估计，企图以泄露这个阵营拥有这些武装力量的事实，来证明这个阵营的侵略意图。但是这种宣传伎俩是不能掩盖事实真相的。人们都看到，美国在远离本国数千公里以外的社会主义阵营各国周围，一批又一批地建立着海空军事基地。某些与苏联和中华人民共和国为邻的国家，违反了本国人民的愿望，被拖进了军事联盟，被武装起来并被变为美国的军事进攻基地。华盛顿的有势力集团根本拒绝和平共处而主张“预防性”战争。在这种情形之下，社会主义阵营的国家还能够不建立自己的武装力量以防止外来的进攻威胁吗？
    为了和平共处，苏联曾不止一次地提议大大裁减军备与禁止原子武器，但是直到现在为止，它的建议一直被资本主义强国所拒绝。苏联关于建立保证和平与集体安全的体系——所有不同社会制度的国家都可以参加这一体系——的建议也同样遭到了强烈的反对。
    因而，威胁和平共处的不是苏联而是美国的侵略政策，这种政策不是为了希望和平的美国人民的利益，而是为了一小撮垄断资本家集团的利益。同时，对于美帝国主义来说，建立军事联盟和在其他资本主义国家中建立军事基地，也是加强美国在整个资本主义世界中的地位的一种手段。在“共同防御共产主义”的幌子下，美帝国主义企图剥夺所有其他资本主义国家的主权与独立，以使他们从属于自己。
                ×　×　×
    尽管美帝国主义施展一切诡计，两种制度和平共处的思想却在资本主义世界内愈来愈得人心了。美国的侵略外交政策正在一次又一次地遭受着挫败。
    美国的欧洲同盟者拒绝了美国政府关于使越南战争“国际化”（按照朝鲜的榜样）的建议。臭名昭著的“欧洲防务集团”也遭到了惨败。东南亚的国家如印度、锡兰、印度尼西亚和缅甸（这些国家拥有近五亿人口）拒绝参加美国所拼凑的“东南亚防务条约”的军事联盟。这个侵略性的联盟遭到了六亿中国人民和亚洲其他各国人民的坚决谴责。
    西欧各国头脑清醒的政界人士愈来愈坚决地反对美国建立侵略集团的政策，而赞成两个制度的和平共处。特别有力地赞成和平共处的是亚洲人民。在中华人民共和国总理同印度总理以及和缅甸总理的会谈中规定了五项原则——互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处。这些国家认为这些原则是它们之间建立相互关系的基础所必需的。这些原则也可以作为所有国家——不论其社会制度如何——和平共处的基础。

    两种制度的和平共处是完全可能的，因为全世界极大多数人民都渴望和平。只有极少数人——战争贩子才想把全世界卷进威胁到人类本身生存的新世界大战的战火中去。和平共处不仅是可能的，而且也是为了全人类的利益所绝对必要的。
