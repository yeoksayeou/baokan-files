    National People's Congress Deputies and Speakers in Beijing
    Convey the Achievements of the National People's Congress Meeting to People from All Walks of Life
    Deputies from Inner Mongolia, Hunan, and other places extensively deliver reports to cadres and the masses
    In Beijing, some National People's Congress deputies and many speakers are actively conveying the proceedings and achievements of the First Session of the First National People's Congress to people from all walks of life, including workers, shop assistants, farmers, students, and grassroots activists.
    In recent days, various units have been holding report meetings. Xuanwu, East Suburb, Dongsi, Dongdan and other districts began conveying the information on the 23rd, with more than 30,000 people listening to the speakers' reports. More than 7,000 workers from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, People's Printing Factory, Xinhua Printing Factory, Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, and Qinghe Woolen Mill listened to the reports. Most of the farmers in the eastern suburbs also heard the reports. The masses who heard the reports also enthusiastically participated in discussions. Workers at the Beijing Instrument Factory, who had already overfulfilled their production plans for the first three quarters, said at group discussion meetings: We must overfulfill the production plan for the fourth quarter and implement the spirit of the National People's Congress meeting.
    Some National People's Congress deputies reported on the situation of the National People's Congress meeting and their own feelings about participating in the meeting at mass rallies. National People's Congress deputies Huang Runping (Beijing Municipal Industrial Labor Model), Tian Hua (actress), Li Yong (former driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive), Liu Shimei (female worker from Qinghe Woolen Mill), and Li Shusen (deputy chief engineer of Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory) delivered reports to the city's industrial labor models, advanced producers, worker-artists, the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, and other units.
    The city plans to spend more than a month conveying the proceedings, achievements, and spirit of the Congress, Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution, and Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government.

    National People's Congress deputies who have returned to their home areas have actively launched activities, extensively reporting to cadres and the masses, promoting study and production in various places.
    National People's Congress deputies from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have already delivered reports to cadres of various organizations directly under the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, cadres of various organizations directly under the Eastern Inner Mongolia Region, and some herdsmen. Wang Dianxing (National Forestry Labor Model and National People's Congress deputy from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), after returning to the Greater Khingan Range forest area, in addition to giving a report to the staff of the Arxan Forest Industry Bureau, also went deep into the workshops of various trades scattered in the vast forest area to convey the information. Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, held a radio broadcast rally, where National People's Congress deputies broadcast the proceedings and achievements of the National People's Congress meeting to cadres, workers, students, and people from all walks of life in the city, briefly introducing Chairman Mao's opening speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, and Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, and emphasized that the people of the city should set an example in abiding by the constitution and laws, and strive to fulfill the 1954 national plan ahead of schedule and support the liberation of Taiwan.
    National People's Congress deputies from Hunan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and other provinces have already delivered or are about to deliver reports to government cadres. Some areas have also organized a large number of speakers to convey information to cadres and the masses at all levels. At present, cadres at all levels are combining the reports of the National People's Congress deputies to study the various documents of the National People's Congress meeting in depth.
    The conveyance of the situation and resolutions of the National People's Congress meeting has powerfully promoted the production enthusiasm of the people in various places. After hearing the report from National People's Congress deputy Huheletai, the members of the Huheletai Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region conducted discussions in conjunction with their production work, deciding to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan and the construction of the motherland by doing a good job in wintering and spring work and increasing the number of livestock. Now, the members are continuing to build sheds and pens for livestock to prevent the severe cold and snowstorms this winter and next spring. Chen Yongkang (National People's Congress deputy from Jiangsu Province) delivered reports at the general meeting of the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative, the general meeting of the Youth League branch, and other mass meetings in the vicinity. After the reports, he helped the members formulate a covenant for careful harvesting, striving to harvest two more jin of rice per mu. After hearing the report, the members strengthened their concept of obeying the national plan and changed their past habit of not planting summer-ripening crops; they turned one-crop fields into two-crop fields, using idle fields to plant 1,100 mu of wheat, rapeseed, and other crops after the autumn harvest.
