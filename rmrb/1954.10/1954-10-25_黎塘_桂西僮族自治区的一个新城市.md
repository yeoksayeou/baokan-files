Litang - A New City in the Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region
廖哲煌 (Liào Zhéhuáng)

    From Liuzhou, a four-hour train ride south brings you to Litang Station. Litang is a new city growing on the eastern edge of the Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region. To Litang's left lies the agriculturally rich area along the Yu River, and to its right are the towns of Yulin and Luxu, known for their developed handicrafts. The Xiang-Gui Railway, running north-south, and the main highway traversing southwest Guangxi Province converge here. Consequently, it has become a hub for the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in central Guangxi Province. A large quantity of agricultural products are transported from here to various locations within and outside the province; also, a large quantity of industrial products from the interior are transferred here for distribution to the Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region and remote towns and mountain villages in the south. Litang exports products such as Guixian white sugar, the famous Luxu porcelain, as well as dried lychees, dried longans, wooden potato flour, peanut oil, and other local products; the textile industry in Yulin needs cotton from Henan, and the vast number of farmers need large quantities of shirting, printed cloth, cigarettes, and cultural supplies from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, etc., all of which are transported in and out in large quantities every day.

    The development of Litang is rapid. In 1950, the area was still very desolate, with traces of the Kuomintang bandit regime everywhere. Banditry was rampant, and commercial vehicles traveling on the highway were often robbed, requiring armed escorts. The people's lives were hard. A small street had a dozen or so shops, all of which were deserted. Even everyday items like soap were hard to come by.

    More than three years later, Litang has completely changed. With the establishment of the railway station, the urban area has rapidly expanded southward, and several new streets have appeared. Inside and outside the station are piles of goods waiting to be transported. The barren hills in front have been filled with rows of workers' dormitories. Comfortable and spacious clinics and workers' clubs have been built. Loading and unloading workers live in newly built houses with green windows and red walls. Emerging from the station is the new and wide street, with beautiful new buildings standing on both sides. The People's Bank of China, cooperatives, post offices, and state-owned trading companies have all established branches here. Now, the population of Litang has increased from a few hundred in the past to nearly ten thousand. Mobile film projection teams frequently come here to show movies to the People's Liberation Army, workers, farmers of all ethnic groups, and city residents. This city is still developing, and a large bus station is about to be built to meet the needs of urban and rural economic development. People here can no longer see the dilapidated scenes of more than three years ago. (Xinhua News Agency)

    黎塘——桂西僮族自治区的一个新城市
    廖哲煌
    从柳州搭火车南下，四个多钟头便到了黎塘车站。黎塘是桂西僮族自治区东边的一个正在成长起来的新城市。黎塘左边是农产品富饶的郁江两岸，右边是手工业发达的郁林和芦墟镇。贯穿南北的湘桂铁路和横亘广西省西南的公路干线都汇集在这里。因此，它成了广西省中部城乡物资交流的枢纽。有大批农产品从这里运到本省及省外各地；也有大批内地运来的工业品从这里转运到桂西僮族自治区和南部遥远的城镇和山村。从黎塘输出去的物品有贵县白糖，有全省著名的芦墟瓷器，还有荔枝干、桂元肉、木茹粉、花生油等土产；郁林的纺织业需要河南的棉花、广大农民需要上海、广州、汉口的大批士林布、花布、香烟、文化用品等，每天都大批大批地运进运出。
    黎塘的发展是很快的。一九五零年的时候，这里还很萧条，到处残留着国民党匪帮统治时期的痕迹，匪患很严重，公路上行驶的商车时常被抢劫，交通要靠武装护运。人民生活很苦，一条小街上十几家店铺都是冷冷落落的，连日常用的肥皂也不容易买到。
    三年多后的今天，黎塘完全变样了。随着火车站的建立，市区迅速向南伸展，出现了好几条大街。车站内外到处堆积着待运的货物。前面的荒山已盖满了一排排的职工宿舍。舒适宽敞的卫生所和工人俱乐部都已建立起来了。装卸工人住上了新建的绿窗红墙的房子。走出车站就是那新建的宽阔的大街，街道两旁矗立着漂亮的新楼房，中国人民银行、合作社、邮政局和国营贸易公司都在这里设立了分支机构。现在，黎塘市的人口已由过去的几百人增加到近万人了。流动电影放映队经常来这里，给人民解放军、工人、各族农民和市民放映电影。这个城市还在发展，随着城乡经济发展的需要，一个大型的汽车站即将开始修建。人们在这里再也看不到三年多以前的破落景象了。　（新华社）
