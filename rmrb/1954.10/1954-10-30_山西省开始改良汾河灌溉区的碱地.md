Shanxi Province Begins to Improve Alkaline Land in the Fen River Irrigation Area

The Fen River irrigation area in central Shanxi Province has a total of more than 178,000 mu of alkaline land, accounting for 14 percent of the cultivated land area of the entire irrigation area. The soil near the alkaline land also has a tendency to gradually become alkaline. After the land becomes alkaline, the yield per mu is reduced by about 90 to 150 jin; at the same time, the wheat planting area is also greatly reduced. In order to solve this problem, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources organized an investigation team for the Fen River Irrigation Area to conduct on-the-spot research in cooperation with Soviet experts to find out the causes of soil alkalization and determine the principles and measures for preventing alkalization and improving alkaline land. According to the instructions from higher authorities and the suggestions of Soviet experts, Shanxi Province has also formulated a plan for alkaline land improvement and established the Fen River Irrigation Area Alkaline Land Improvement Research Working Group to conduct experiments at two base points in Xiejiazhai, Wenshui, and Beiying Village, Pingyao. Xiejiazhai has completed the detailed soil survey of 300 mu of land, and the first leaching began on October 12, with a total of three leaching sessions before freezing. After leaching, these alkaline wasteland areas that have not grown crops for a long time will grow lush crops next year. More than 1,000 mu of severely alkaline land in Beiying Village, where seedlings do not grow, have had good crops this year after mobilizing the masses to fight against alkalinity, and cotton has begun to be harvested.

The leaching experiment in Xiejiazhai will set an example for more than 170,000 mu of alkaline land in the Fen River Irrigation Area. With the development of alkaline land improvement work in the Fen River Irrigation Area, the two million mu of saline-alkali wasteland in Shanxi Province will gradually be transformed into fertile farmland.

    山西省开始改良汾河灌溉区的碱地
    山西省中部的汾河灌溉区，共有十七万八千多亩碱地，占全灌溉区耕地面积的百分之十四，临近碱地的土壤也有逐渐碱化的趋势。土地碱化后，每亩约降低产量九十斤到一百五十斤；同时，小麦播种面积也大大减少。为了解决这一问题，农业部和水利部曾组织汾河灌溉区考察组，协同苏联专家进行实地研究，找出土壤碱化原因，确定防止碱化和改良碱地的方针和措施。山西省根据上级指示和苏联专家的建议，也作出了碱地改良方案，并成立了汾河灌溉区碱地改良研究工作组，分别在文水谢家寨、平遥北营村两个基点进行试验。谢家寨已完成三百亩土地的土壤详测工作，并在十月十二日开始第一次洗碱，结冻前共可洗三次。经过洗碱后，这些长期不长庄稼的碱盐荒地，明年将生长出繁茂的庄稼。北营村一千多亩不长苗的重碱地，经过发动群众进行抗碱斗争，今年的庄稼长得很好，棉花已开始收摘。
    谢家寨的洗碱实验，将给汾河灌溉区十七万多亩碱地做出榜样。随着汾河灌溉区碱地改良工作的开展，山西全省二百万亩盐碱荒滩，都将逐渐变为肥沃的良田。　（阎明祥）
