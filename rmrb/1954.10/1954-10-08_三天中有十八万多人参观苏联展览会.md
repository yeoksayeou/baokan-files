    Over 180,000 People Visit Soviet Exhibition in Three Days
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] From the 5th to the 7th, a total of more than 180,000 visitors visited the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction.
    On the 5th, it rained lightly all day. Visitors were still very enthusiastic. Many people waited for the opening of the museum in the square opposite the exhibition hall very early. Inside the exhibition hall, the continuous stream of people was as crowded as ever. On the plazas on both sides of the industrial hall, when the operators braved the rain to demonstrate the "Donbass" coal mining combine, dump trucks, and grain combine harvesters, the audience watched, wearing raincoats and holding umbrellas. There were more than 60,000 visitors that day.
    Workers and technicians in the capital visited the industrial hall particularly carefully. Maintenance workers from the State-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory surrounded a small double-sided textile machine and took notes on the explanations of the commentators. Workers from the Beijing Universal Machinery Factory, who were studying high-speed cutting methods in the factory, immediately recorded the dimensions and angles of the cutting tools when they saw the operators demonstrating high-speed cutting on a screw lathe this time, preparing to promote them upon their return.
    In these three days, teachers, students, and staff from fifteen universities and colleges in the capital visited the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction. Students from the Beijing Railway Institute studied and researched in the area displaying railway electrical equipment exhibits. On the afternoon of the 7th, teachers from the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute explained to more than 1,000 students in front of tractors and various agricultural machines on the west square. They believed this was the best classroom. The film hall screened a total of twelve films in three days, with more than 10,000 viewers.

    三天中有十八万多人参观苏联展览会
    【新华社七日讯】从五日到七日，共有十八万多观众参观了苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会。
    五日，整天下着细雨。观众依然很踊跃。许多人很早就在展览馆对面的广场上等候开馆。展览馆里面，川流不息的人群像往日一样拥挤。在工业馆两侧的广场上，当操作人员冒雨表演“顿巴斯”采煤联合机、自卸汽车和谷物联合收割机的时候，观众穿着雨衣、撑着雨伞围看。这天的观众有六万多人。
    首都的工人和技术人员，对工业馆参观得特别仔细。国营北京第一棉纺织厂的保全工们，围住一部小型双面纺织机，用笔记下了说明员的解说。正在厂里学习高速切削法的北京市通用机器厂的工人们，这次看到操作人员在螺丝车床上表演高速切削时，连忙记下了车刀的尺寸和角度，准备回去推广。
    这三天内，首都有十五个高等学校的师生员工参观了苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会。北京铁道学院的学生们，在陈列铁路电气设备展览品的地方，一面看一面在研究。七日下午，北京农业机械化学院的教师们在西广场上的拖拉机和各种农业机器面前向一千多位学生讲解。他们认为这是一个最好的课堂。电影馆在三天内，一共放映了十二场电影，观众一万多人。
