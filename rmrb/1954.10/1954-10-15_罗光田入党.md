Luo Guangtian Joins the Party
By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming

July 29th, on the third morning of continuous wind and rain in Wuhan, the Xiaozhang Gongdi embankment, already facing flooding internally and externally, was further pressured by a Force 7 gale. Waves taller than a person crashed against this weak embankment, some sweeping over the top, others washing away the embankment's mud and sandbags. Danger arose everywhere along the sixteen-li embankment. The section responsible for rescue by the Fifth Company of the Third Detachment of a certain engineering unit had thirteen large holes breached in a forty-meter stretch, with some sections of the embankment hollowed out by two-thirds. People threw sandbags to block the holes, but with a swirl of the waves, these 350-jin sandbags were dragged away by the floodwaters. The reserves of sandbags were running out, and the breaches were still widening, threatening a breach. At this moment, the flood prevention section chief issued an emergency mobilization order: "Comrades, we must spare no effort to protect this section of the embankment, to protect the lives and property of the people of Hankou!"

At this critical juncture, people saw Luo Guangtian—a dark, tall young soldier—speak a few words to the platoon leader, wrap a rope around his waist, and shout loudly: "Now is the time when the Party and the motherland need us!" He plunged into the water at the place where the waves were fiercest and the hole was largest. People quickly tightened the ropes, helping him struggle to stand up in the water; he used his shoulders and back to block the most dangerous breach, stopping the waves. This courageous act inspired everyone, and He Jinxian, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, and more than thirty soldiers jumped into the water, using their bodies to block all the breaches. The Force 7 gale, strong enough to halt Yangtze River ferries, rushed forward, pushing them against the embankment; then retreated, pulling them into the deep water. The waves crashing over their heads blinded them, and the floodwater rushing into their noses choked them. Dazed by the impact, Luo Guangtian and his comrades thought of nothing else; the idea of protecting the embankment sustained them, and they clung tightly to anything they could grasp, enduring the waves.

Around ten o'clock, trucks and boats arrived from afar, carrying sacks and mud. People were preparing to first block the large hole that Luo Guangtian was blocking, but he asked everyone to first block the easier-to-rescue holes, and then concentrate their efforts on rescuing the big one. Some comrades wanted to get into the water to replace him, but he firmly refused, fearing that a replacement would endanger the embankment. He persevered from eight o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock, finally using seven large sandbags to completely block the large hole.

When the rescue team took a break to eat, Luo Guangtian was still worried. He rushed back to the embankment after eating only half a bowl of rice. At this time, the flood was fiercely pounding the embankment again. The seven large sandbags that had just been filled were all washed away. Earlier in the morning, one person could block a breach in the embankment, but now the breach had more than doubled in size and was growing larger and larger. Luo Guangtian, in a moment of quick thinking, tied one end of the rope around his waist to a telephone pole, picked up a bundle of reeds, jumped into the water, used the reeds to block the breach, and pressed himself firmly against the reeds, preventing the waves from washing them away. At this time, the reeds and wooden stakes thrown into the water for wave protection surged towards him with the waves, piercing his skin and bruising his ribs. When people returned to the embankment, they found that other places were also in danger. Everyone was busy preparing bricks and tiles to block the breaches and couldn't spare anyone to replace him. He gritted his teeth and persisted in the waves. When his back was sore, he turned over to use his chest to resist. When his chest was sore, he turned over again. Luo Guangtian persisted until four o'clock in the afternoon, until bricks and stones were transported and the embankment breach was blocked.

At dusk, a new rescue team came to replace them, and the troops returned to rest. Luo Guangtian and other wounded were left behind to be escorted by the deputy instructor. Luo Guangtian had been soaked in the water all day, and at this time he was completely exhausted. However, seeing that the deputy instructor was very busy, he struggled to walk back. Halfway there, he blacked out and fell off the narrow embankment into the lake. Fortunately, a nearby worker saw him and quickly rescued him, carrying him to the headquarters for emergency treatment. At this time, his face was pale and his lips were blue, and he was unconscious.

Luo Guangtian, a native of Xianning, Hubei, came from a poor peasant family. He was twenty-five years old this year and joined the army in 1950. Under the education of the Party in recent years, his awareness has been rapidly raised, and his work has always been positive. He has made contributions in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and many national defense projects, and has been awarded the title of "Excellent League Member" three times. He attended the first congress of model heroes of the People's Liberation Army participating in construction engineering units. After returning to the unit from the meeting in Beijing, he immediately applied to the Party branch for membership, determined to dedicate everything he had to the Party and to the cause of communism. The branch committee discussed the issue of Luo Guangtian's application for Party membership and unanimously agreed that he had a clear history, a high level of ideological awareness, and could be considered as a candidate for development. Subsequently, the branch sent him to a Party training class to further strengthen Party education. After the troops arrived in Wuhan, he kept in mind the instructions of his superiors and was eager to quickly learn the techniques and work hard to build a modern national defense force. However, just as the course came to an end, an unprecedented flood began to threaten Wuhan. As the son of a farmer who had grown up in Hubei, he deeply understood the harm that floods could cause to the people. When he returned from rescuing disaster victims in the suburbs, he excitedly gave a report to the Party branch: "I am determined to overcome difficulties, not be afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, respond to all the calls of the Party, defeat the floods, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland and the 1.5 million people of Wuhan!"

He participated in the work of repairing the embankment. On the muddy road, more than 1,200 meters long, it usually took fifteen or sixteen minutes for people to carry a load of soil, but Luo Guangtian only took thirteen minutes. He carried more than 5,400 jin of soil by himself in one day. During breaks, everyone was very tired. This young man, who usually didn't like to talk much because he stuttered a bit, repeatedly encouraged everyone: "Commander-in-Chief Zhu instructed us: Go wherever it is most difficult!" "We are members of the Youth League, we must be good assistants to the Party and strive to join the Party."

On the day Luo Guangtian fainted, his bones ached all over, and he didn't sleep all night. The next morning, the troops were going to rescue again. He was struggling to get out of bed when the instructor came in and said to him, "You can rest at home today." When he woke up after a hazy sleep, his comrades had all left, and the room was quiet. At this time, he remembered the scene when he and several young people from the same village shouted the slogan "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home and the Country" and joined the army, and the villagers warmly sent them off; he remembered the speeches of the leaders at the congress of model heroes: "Our task is to protect the people and protect the construction of the motherland..." He remembered the heroic deeds of Huang Jiguang and Luo Shengjiao told by the instructor; he remembered that one of the eight conditions of the Communist Party member standard he learned in the training class was that the personal interests of a Party member must unconditionally obey the interests of the Party... A force encouraged him, and he thought: "Huang Jiguang blocked the enemy's machine gun hole with his body for the victory of one battle; Luo Shengjiao sacrificed his life to save a Korean boy. I am protecting 1.5 million people in Wuhan, and I want to follow them!"

At this time, he could no longer feel the pain in his bones, and he quickly put on his clothes and ran towards the embankment. He went to report to the instructor: "Other comrades were also tired all day yesterday, they are not resting, a young man like me cannot bow his head in the face of difficulties." The instructor had no choice but to agree to his request, and he jumped into the water and worked all day.

The continuous hard work made Luo Guangtian sick, and he could only eat two eggs a day. The instructor asked him to rest again, but he refused, saying: "This is the Party caring for me. However, the flood will not stop attacking Wuhan because I am sick, and a young man like me has no difficulties that cannot be overcome!" He still insisted on rescue work. During the days when the troops were resting, he continued to work, finding the broken dustpans and ropes used by his comrades and slowly repairing them while sitting on the ground.

Luo Guangtian's heroic deeds quickly spread throughout the Third Detachment and the embankment they were guarding. The slogan "Learn from Comrade Luo Guangtian" resounded throughout the detachment, and the workers and peasants on the embankment also said: "Learn from Black Tall Guy (referring to Luo Guangtian)!"

In mid-August, the Luo Jiawan embankment subsided by three centimeters in one hour, and the situation was very critical. Under the encouragement of the slogan "Learn from Luo Guangtian," the soldiers participating in the rescue were all carrying sandbags weighing more than 350 jin each. Young soldier Jiang Zuxiao fell down and was knocked unconscious by the heavy sandbag, but after being rescued and waking up, he immediately wanted to carry the sandbag again. The instructor wouldn't let him go, and he said: "I am a young man, I cannot fall behind, I want to follow Luo Guangtian's example!" Later, the instructor gave an order, and he stopped. Yang Dezhi, a member of the Youth League who competed with Luo Guangtian, slipped into the water from the springboard when carrying sandbags to the boat. The sharp stone pierced his foot, and the wound was more than an inch deep, but he didn't care and persisted until the danger was eliminated. Forty soldiers who participated in this rescue transported 350 large sandbags in one hour. The workers on the embankment, who originally carried one sandbag together by four people, saw the soldiers so heroic and automatically changed to carrying one sandbag by two people.

Under the encouragement of the slogan "Learn from Luo Guangtian," the entire detachment quickly launched a merit-making campaign. During the rescue of the major danger at E'touwan, three comrades made meritorious deeds on the spot. During the rescue of the Luo Jiawan danger, the Fifth Company, where Luo Guangtian was located, made a collective meritorious deed on the spot.

On the day the Wuhan Municipal Flood Control Headquarters held an award ceremony, Luo Guangtian took a car to the city to attend the conference. Along the way, he saw chimneys smoking and production continuing as normal at many factories directly protected by the Xiaozhang Gongdi embankment, such as power plants, water plants, cotton mills, automobile factories, and flour mills. The steel beams on the bridge piers of the Hanshui Railway Bridge had been extended by another section. There were still so many pedestrians at the Jianghan Road intersection—men, women, old people, and children. Huge posters announced the dramas and films being shown in theaters. The buses were still full of passengers... The construction of the country was proceeding as usual, and the people in the city were still living peacefully. His common ideal with all the people who participated in flood control had been realized. What could be more exciting and inspiring to this soldier who had been fighting day and night on the embankment than these scenes? He felt an unspeakable joy in his heart.

Luo Guangtian was approved to join the Party by the Party Committee of the Third Detachment on August 17th—the day the flood threatened Wuhan most severely. In his application for Party membership, he wrote: "I am determined to dedicate all my strength and life to fighting for the cause of communism to the end!" In various works, especially in the flood control struggle, this young soldier cultivated by the Party has faithfully fulfilled his oath.

    罗光田入党
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    七月二十九日，武汉市连日风雨的第三个早晨，外临洪水内有渍水的小张公堤，又遭到了七级风的压迫。一人多高的巨浪冲击着这段薄弱的堤防，有的扑过了堤顶，有的卷走了堤身的泥土和麻包。长达十六里的堤防，到处发生了险情。某工程部队三支队第五连负责抢救的一段，有四十公尺长的堤防，被冲开了十三个大洞，有的堤身被淘空了三分之二。人们投下麻包去堵洞，但只见浪花一卷，这三百五十多斤重一个的麻包便被洪水拖走了。储备的麻包快要用光了，而堤洞还在扩大，眼看有决口的危险。这时候，防汛段长发出了紧急动员令：“同志们，我们要不惜一切保住这段堤防，保卫汉口人民的生命财产！”
    就在这紧急关头，人们看见罗光田——一个黑黑的大个子青年战士同排长说了几句话，用绳子往腰间一缠，高声喊道：“现在正是党和祖国需要我们的时候！”就在浪最猛洞最大的地方扑下水去了。人们连忙拉紧绳索，帮助他挣扎着从水中站起来；他便用肩背堵住最危险的洞口，挡住风浪。这样勇敢的行为激励了大家，青年团支部书记何津先和三十多个战士都跳下水去，用身体堵住了所有的洞口。足以使长江轮渡停航的七级风浪，一阵子往前涌来，就把他们冲向堤壁；一阵子往后退去，又把他们卷向深水中。扑过头顶的浪头打得他们睁不开眼，灌进鼻子的洪水呛得他们喘不过气。被冲得昏沉沉的罗光田和他的伙伴们什么也顾不得想了，保住堤防的念头支持着他们，他们死死抓紧可以攀住的任何东西，任凭风浪冲打。
    十点多钟，从远处用汽车和船只运来了麻袋和泥土。人们正准备先堵罗光田堵着的那个大洞，但他叫大家先堵那些容易抢救的洞，最后再集中力量抢救这个大的。有的同志要下水去替换他，但他坚决不肯，他怕堤防在替换时发生危险。他一直由上午八时坚持到十二时，最后用七个大麻包将大洞完全堵塞起来。
    抢险队员们抽空吃饭的时候，罗光田放不下心，刚吃了半碗饭又跑上堤去。这时，洪水又在凶猛地冲击堤防，刚刚填上的七个大麻包全给冲走了，上午堤上的洞口一人还能堵住，现在洞口扩大了一倍多，而且越冲越大。罗光田这时急中生智，把捆在腰上的绳索的一端缠在电线杆上，便抱起一捆芦柴跳下水去，用芦柴将洞口堵住，自己紧紧伏在芦柴上，不让风浪将它冲走。这时候，抛在水中防浪用的芦柴和木桩，随着风浪的起伏向他冲来，刺破了他的皮，撞痛了他的肋骨。当人们回到堤上时，发现别的地方也出了险情，大家忙着准备砖瓦来堵塞洞口，没法抽出人来替换他。他咬紧牙关坚持在风浪里，背撞痛了，便翻过身用胸口抵挡，胸撞痛了，又再翻一个身。罗光田一直坚持到下午四时，直到运来了砖石，把堤洞堵塞起来。
    黄昏，新的抢险队来替换他们，部队开回去休整。罗光田和其他的伤员被留下由副指导员护送。罗光田在水里泡了一天，这时候已经周身无力，但是，他看见副指导员很忙，自己便挣扎着步行回去。走到半路，他眼前一黑，便从狭窄的堤上栽进湖里去了。幸亏旁边的民工看见，连忙将他抢救起来，抬到指挥部进行急救。这时，他已嘴青面黑，昏迷不省人事了。
    罗光田，湖北咸宁人，贫农出身，今年二十五岁，一九五○年参军。几年来在党的教育下，他的觉悟迅速提高，工作一贯积极。他在荆江分洪工程和许多国防工程中都立过功，三次获得“优秀团员”的称号，出席过中国人民解放军参加建筑工程部队举行的首届功臣模范代表大会。由北京开会回到部队后，他立即向党支部申请入党，决心把自己的一切献给党，献给共产主义事业。支部委员会讨论了罗光田申请入党的问题，一致认为他历史清楚，思想觉悟较高，可以作为发展的对象。接着，支部送他到党训班学习，进一步对他加强党的教育。部队来到武汉后，他牢记着上级的指示，一心想赶快学好技术，为建设现代化的国防军而努力。但是课程刚告一段落，百年未有的洪水开始威胁武汉。这个从小生长在湖北的农民的儿子，是深刻了解洪水对人民的危害的。当他抢救郊区灾民回来，便激动地向党的支部打了个报告：“我决心不避艰苦，不怕流血牺牲，响应党的一切号召，战胜洪水，保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫武汉一百五十万人民！”
    他参加了抢修堤防的工作。在往返一千二百多公尺长的泥泞道上，挑一担土，一般人需要十五六分钟，罗光田却只要十三分钟。他一人一天挑了五千四百多斤土。一休息下来，人们都很疲劳，这个因为有些结巴而平日不大爱讲话的青年，这时一再地鼓励大家：“朱总司令指示过我们：哪里最艰苦就到哪里去！”“我们是青年团员，一定要作好党的助手，争取入党。”
    罗光田晕倒的那天，周身骨头疼痛，一夜没有合眼。第二天早晨，部队又要去抢险。他正挣扎着要起床，指导员走来对他说：“你今天就在家里休息。”当他模模糊糊地睡了一阵醒来时，同志们都走了，房里静悄悄的。这时他想起和同村的几个青年高呼着“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的口号参军，老乡们热烈欢送他们的情形；想起首长们在功臣模范代表大会上的讲话：“我们的任务是保卫人民，保卫祖国的建设，……”他想起指导员所讲的黄继光、罗盛教的英雄事迹；想起在训练班里学习的共产党员标准的八项条件中有一条是党员个人利益必须无条件地服从党的利益……一股力量鼓舞着他，他想道：“黄继光为了一次战斗的胜利，就用身体将敌人的机枪眼子堵住；罗盛教为了抢救一个朝鲜少年，牺牲了自己的生命，我这是保卫武汉市一百五十万人，我要跟上去！”
    这时，他已经感觉不到骨头疼，连忙穿上衣服，便往堤上跑。他去报告指导员：“其他同志昨天也累了一天，他们都不休息，我一个年青人不能在困难面前低头。”指导员只得答应他的要求，他便跳下水去，干了一整天。
    连日的劳累使罗光田病了，他每天只能吃两个鸡蛋。指导员又叫他休息，他还不肯，他说：“这是党关怀我。但是，洪水不会因为我生病就不进攻武汉，我一个青年人没有克服不了的困难！”他仍然坚持抢险工作。在部队休整的日子里，他继续劳动着，把同志们用坏了的畚箕、绳索找出来，坐在地上慢慢地修理。
    罗光田的英雄事迹很快地传遍了三支队和他们守卫的堤防。支队里响起了热烈的“向罗光田同志学习”的口号，堤上的工人和农民也说：“要向黑大个子（指罗光田）学习！”
    八月中旬，罗家湾堤防在一小时内下挫三公分，情况很危急。参加抢险的战士们，在“向罗光田学习”的口号鼓舞下，都是一人扛一个三百五十多斤重的麻包。青年战士江祖孝跌倒了，被沉重的麻包压得晕过去，但经过急救醒过来时，立即又要去扛麻包。指导员不让他去，他说：“我是个青年，不能落后，我要向罗光田看齐！”后来指导员下了命令，他才停下来。和罗光田竞赛的青年团员杨德芝，扛麻包下船时，从跳板上滑到水里，石头尖把脚刺破了，伤口有一寸多深，他也不管，一直坚持到消灭了险情。参加这次抢险的四十名战士，在一小时内，便搬运了三百五十个大麻包。堤上的民工原来是四人合抬一个麻包，看见战士们这样英勇，也自动改为两人扛一个。
    在“向罗光田学习”的口号鼓舞下，全支队迅速展开了立功运动。在抢救鄂头湾的重大险情时，有三个同志现场立功。抢救罗家湾险情时，罗光田所在的五连，在现场上立了集体功。
    武汉市防汛指挥部召开奖励大会那天，罗光田坐汽车进城去参加大会。沿途，他望见由小张公堤直接保卫着的电厂、水厂、纱厂、汽车厂、面粉厂……许多工厂的烟囱都冒着烟，照常生产着。汉水铁桥桥台上的钢梁又伸长了一节。江汉路口的行人，男的女的，老人小孩，还是那么多。巨幅的海报公布着戏院正在上演的戏剧和放映的影片。公共汽车上依然挤满了乘客……。国家的建设照常在进行，市内的人民依然安静地生活。他和所有参加防汛的人们的共同理想实现了，还有什么能比这些景象让这个日日夜夜战斗在堤防上的战士更兴奋、更激动呢？他心里感到有一种说不出的愉快。
    罗光田在八月十七日——洪水危胁武汉最严重的日子里，由三支队党委会批准入党了。他在申请入党的志愿书中曾这样写道：“我决心献出自己的一切力量和生命，终身为共产主义事业奋斗到底！”在各种工作中，特别是在防汛斗争中，这个由党培养出来的青年战士，已经忠实地履行了他的誓言。
