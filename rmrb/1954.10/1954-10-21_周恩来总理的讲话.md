Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respectable Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen,

We are deeply honored that Prime Minister Nehru, at the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, has come to our country on behalf of the Government of the Republic of India for a visit. On behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, I extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guest, the representative of our great neighbor, the outstanding Indian statesman Prime Minister Nehru, and through Prime Minister Nehru, I convey our heartfelt respect to the Government and people of the Republic of India.

Mr. Nehru's arduous struggle alongside Gandhi for Indian independence is no stranger to the Chinese people. Mr. Nehru showed sympathy for the cause of independence and liberation of the Chinese people very early on. During the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Nehru was very concerned about China's unity against Japan. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of Prime Minister Nehru, India quickly established diplomatic relations with our country. India, together with other peace-loving countries, promoted and assisted in the armistice in Korea. Not long ago, India, together with the countries concerned of the Colombo Conference, made important contributions to the restoration of peace in Indochina. Now, India, together with Poland and Canada, is still undertaking the task of supervising the ceasefire in Indochina. India has consistently supported the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in international affairs. The Chinese people are very happy to have India as such a friendly neighbor and Prime Minister Nehru as such an outstanding friend in the common cause of maintaining peace.

India and China are both major countries in Asia. We are two ancient countries in the world, and also two young countries. For more than two thousand years in the past, India and China have had close cultural and economic ties. There has never been a record of war between our two countries in history. In modern times, the people of our two countries have also been subjected to colonial oppression and have carried out anti-colonial struggles. This shared experience has made the people of our two countries sympathize with and care for each other since very early on. Now the people of our two countries both have the desire to strive for a peaceful international environment and build their own countries. The people of our two countries are also struggling to continue to oppose foreign interference, get rid of economic backwardness, and realize the complete independence of the country. This not only lays the foundation for the friendly cooperation between the people of our two countries, but also strengthens the profound friendship that has already been established between the people of our two countries. The warm welcome expressed by the Chinese people for the visit of Prime Minister Nehru, who represents our great neighbor, proves this point. This profound friendship shows that the friendly cooperation between our two countries has broad prospects for future development.

In June of this year, I visited the Republic of India on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China. Thanks to the sincere cooperation of the Government and people of the Republic of India, and especially thanks to the sincere cooperation of Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Prime Minister Nehru and I issued a joint statement, jointly proposing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basic principles guiding Sino-Indian relations. There is no doubt that the publication of this statement is of historical significance. China and India are the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Our two countries have the obligation to implement these principles in our mutual relations and use facts to prove that these principles are mutually beneficial and not mutually harmful. We have already done so, and we will continue to do so. We believe that the peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between China and India will surely help promote the gradual realization of peaceful coexistence in Asia and other countries in the world.

At present, the majority of people in the world welcome peaceful coexistence and are willing to see the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence realized. However, there are also a few people who do not welcome peaceful coexistence and take the opposite action. The Southeast Asia Defense Group is a clear example of this opposite action. In his speech to the Indian Parliament on September 29 this year, Prime Minister Nehru, when talking about the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," pointed out that "the entire approach of the Manila Treaty is not only a wrong approach, but also a dangerous approach." This wrong and dangerous approach has not only not stopped, but also has the danger of expanding beyond the Southeast Asian region. We believe that this situation is the root cause of unrest in Asia.

The results of the Geneva Conference have made possible the initiative proposed by Prime Minister Nehru to establish a peace zone in Southeast Asia. However, the practice of concluding the Manila Treaty runs counter to this initiative. Prime Minister Nehru said in his speech to the Indian Parliament on September 16 this year: "India's policy is to establish a peace zone in Asia, and also to establish a peace zone in other places, if possible." Obviously, this policy of establishing and expanding peace zones is in line with the interests of the people of India and Asian countries. We welcome Prime Minister Nehru's proposal and are willing to work together with India to overcome difficulties and establish and expand peace zones in Asia.

The Chinese government and people highly value the friendly cooperation with the Indian government and people. I would like to mention the recent trade agreement signed between China and India, which will greatly strengthen the economic cooperation between our two countries. Cultural exchanges between our two countries have already had considerable development. We believe that the economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between our two countries will continue to be strengthened. The friendly cooperation between the 960 million people of China and India is an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world. We hope that the Sino-Indian friendship that has been established can be further consolidated and developed, so that the relationship between China and India will become an example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and ideologies in the world.

Respectable Prime Minister, I firmly believe that your visit can deepen the understanding between our two countries, strengthen the friendly cooperation between our two countries, and promote peace between Asia and the world.

Long live Sino-Indian friendship!
Long live Asian peace!
Long live world peace!
Let us raise our glasses to the health of President Prasad of the Republic of India!

    周恩来总理的讲话
    尊敬的总理先生各位女士、各位先生：
    尼赫鲁总理阁下应中华人民共和国政府的邀请代表印度共和国政府前来我国访问，我们感到十分荣幸。我谨代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向我们的贵宾、我们伟大邻邦的代表、印度杰出的政治家尼赫鲁总理阁下表示热忱的欢迎，并通过尼赫鲁总理阁下向印度共和国政府和人民表示衷心的敬意。
    尼赫鲁先生同甘地一起为印度独立所进行的艰苦斗争，对中国人民说来不是生疏的。尼赫鲁先生很早就对中国人民的独立解放事业抱有同情。在中国人民进行抗日战争时期，尼赫鲁先生对中国的团结抗日非常关切。中华人民共和国成立后，在尼赫鲁总理领导之下，印度迅速地同我国建立了邦交。印度同其他爱好和平的国家一起推动并协助了朝鲜的停战。不久以前，印度又同科伦坡会议有关国家一起对印度支那和平的恢复作了重要的贡献。现在，印度还在印度支那同波兰和加拿大一起担任监督停战的任务。印度在国际事务中不断支持中华人民共和国的合法地位。中国人民很高兴在维护和平的共同事业中有印度这样一个友好的邻邦和尼赫鲁总理这样一位卓越的朋友。
    印度和中国都是亚洲的大国。我们是世界上两个古老的国家，同时又是两个年青的国家。过去两千多年来，印度和中国有着密切的文化和经济联系，在我们两国之间，历史上从来没有留下过战争的记录。近代以来，我们两国人民又同样受过殖民主义的压迫和进行过反殖民主义的斗争。这种共同的经历使我们两国人民从很早以来就互相同情，互相关怀。现在我们两国人民都同样抱有争取和平的国际环境和建设自己国家的愿望。我们两国人民又都在为继续反对外来干涉、摆脱经济落后、实现国家的完全独立而斗争。这就不仅使我们两国人民的友好合作具备了基础，而且更加加强了我们两国人民早已结成的深厚友谊。中国人民对于代表我们伟大邻邦的尼赫鲁总理的访问所表示的热烈欢迎证明了这一点。这种深厚友谊显示着我们两国的友好合作是有广阔的发展前途的。
    本年六月我曾代表中华人民共和国政府访问了印度共和国。感谢印度共和国政府和人民的热诚合作，特别感谢印度总理尼赫鲁先生的热诚合作，我和印度总理发表了联合声明，共同提出和平共处的五项原则作为指导中印两国关系的基本原则。毫无疑义，这个声明的发表是有历史意义的。中印两国是和平共处五项原则的倡议者，我们两国负有义务在我们的相互关系中贯彻这些原则，用事实来证明这些原则是互利的，而不是互相损害的。我们已经这样做了，我们还将继续这样做。我们相信中印两国的和平共处和友好合作必将有助于促进亚洲和世界其他国家和平共处的逐步实现。
    目前世界上大多数的人是欢迎和平共处的，并且愿意使和平共处的五项原则得到实现。但是，也还有少数人对和平共处不表欢迎，而采取相反的行动。东南亚防务集团就是这种相反行动的显明例证。尼赫鲁总理今年九月二十九日在印度国会的演说中在谈到“东南亚集体防务条约”时就曾指出：“马尼拉条约整个做法不但是一个错误的做法，而且是一个危险的做法。”这个错误的危险的做法，不仅没有停止，而且还有扩大到东南亚地区以外的危险。我们认为这种情况是造成亚洲不安的根源。
    日内瓦会议的结果使尼赫鲁总理所提出的在东南亚建立一个和平地区的创议成为可能。但是缔结马尼拉条约的做法是同这一创议背道而驰的。尼赫鲁总理今年九月十六日在印度国会的发言中曾经说：“印度的政策是要在亚洲建立一个和平地区，假若可能的话，也在其他地方建立一个和平地区。”显然，这个建立和扩大和平地区的政策是符合印度和亚洲各国人民的利益的。我们欢迎尼赫鲁总理的这个主张，并愿意同印度一道，共同努力，克服困难，建立和扩大亚洲的和平地区。
    中国政府和人民非常珍视同印度政府和人民的友好合作。我想提出最近中印间签订的一次贸易协定，它将大大加强我们两国间的经济合作。我们两国间的文化交流已经有了相当的发展。我们相信，我们两国间的经济合作和文化交流是会不断加强的。中印两国九亿六千万人民的友好合作是维护亚洲和世界和平的一个重要因素。我们希望已经建立起来了的中印友谊，能够更加巩固，更加发展，使中印两国的关系成为世界上不同社会制度和思想体系的国家间和平共处的范例。
    尊敬的总理先生，我深信您的访问，一定能加深我们两国的互相了解，一定能加强我们两国的友好合作，一定能促进亚洲和世界的和平。
    中印友好万岁！
    亚洲和平万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    让我们举杯祝印度共和国普拉沙德总统健康！
