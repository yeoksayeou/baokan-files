    Overseas Chinese Students Returning to China for School This Year
    Receive Care and Assistance from the People's Government and Various Schools
    Overseas Chinese students returning to China for school this year have received warm reception and care from local people's government education departments and various schools. When more than 70 overseas Chinese students arriving in Changsha to attend school, the Changsha Municipal People's Government Education Bureau, the Changsha Student Union, and various schools organized welcoming teams to welcome them to schools in Changsha. Teachers and students from schools such as Wuhan No. 1 Girls' Middle School and No. 3 Girls' Middle School, and Nanjing No. 4 Girls' Middle School warmly welcomed overseas Chinese students to these schools. Cultural and educational organizations in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and other places also specially organized overseas Chinese student work groups to be responsible for receiving overseas Chinese students.
    Schools in various places are very concerned about the study and life of overseas Chinese students returning to China. Nanjing No. 1 Middle School organized 14 outstanding students to help overseas Chinese students with relatively poor academic performance to make up their lessons. The principal of the No. 1 Middle School also introduced the heroic deeds of the Chinese people's struggle against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War to the overseas Chinese students to encourage them to study hard and love their motherland. Some schools in Tianjin, Hankou, Nanjing and other places have also expanded and built new bathhouses to take care of the living habits of overseas Chinese students. The cooks of Nanjing No. 3 Girls' Middle School took the initiative to solicit the opinions of overseas Chinese students on their diet. Many overseas Chinese students returning to China have received care and assistance from the people's government and schools, and are working harder to study and determined to serve the motherland after completing their studies.

    今年回国升学的华侨学生
    受到人民政府和各学校的照顾和帮助
    今年回国升学的华侨学生，受到各地人民政府教育机关和各学校热情的接待和照顾。到长沙市入学的七十多名华侨学生抵达长沙时，长沙市人民政府教育局、长沙市学生联合会和各学校曾组织欢迎队欢迎他们到长沙各学校入学。武汉市第一女子中学和第三女子中学，南京市第四女子中学等校的师生都热烈欢迎华侨学生到这些学校入学。上海、南京和杭州等地的文教机关还专门组织了华侨学生工作组负责接待华侨学生。
    各地学校对回国华侨学生的学习和生活都很关心。南京市第一中学组织了十四名优秀学生帮助程度较差的华侨学生补习功课。第一中学校长还给华侨学生介绍抗日战争时期祖国人民对敌斗争的英勇事迹，以鼓舞他们积极学习，热爱祖国。天津、汉口和南京等地的一些学校，为照顾华侨学生生活习惯，还扩建和新建了洗澡房。南京市第三女子中学的炊事员主动地征求华侨学生对饮食的意见。许多回国华侨学生受到人民政府和学校的照顾和帮助，更加努力学习，决心学好了为祖国服务。
