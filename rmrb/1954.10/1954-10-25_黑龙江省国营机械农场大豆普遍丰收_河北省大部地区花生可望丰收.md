    Heilongjiang State-Operated Mechanical Farms Achieve Widespread Soybean Harvest; Hebei Province Expects a Good Peanut Harvest in Most Areas
    The twenty state-operated mechanical farms in Heilongjiang Province have harvested over 21,400 hectares of soybeans, achieving a bumper crop. According to preliminary statistics, the average yield is over 2,200 jin per hectare, exceeding the yield of local farmers by 200-300 jin per hectare. The average yield of soybeans at farms like Shuguang and Jixian reached 2,800 jin per hectare.
    In order to quickly complete the soybean harvest and reduce losses, the farms deployed over 130 combine harvesters this year. During the harvest, the drivers launched a production increase and conservation campaign, working continuously day and night to accelerate the autumn harvest progress. The tractor teams at Ning'an and Shuguang farms achieved excellent results, harvesting over 15 hectares of soybeans per day; the "No. 176" tractor team at Erlongshan Farm also set a record of harvesting 12 hectares of soybeans in six and a half hours. To reduce losses, farms like Tongbei and Jiusan adopted the method of cross-cutting; at Baoquanling Farm, most employees went to the fields with cloth bags to pick up fallen pods, each person collecting 30 jin of soybeans per day. As a result, the harvest loss at each farm this year did not exceed 3 percent, increasing the yield by 40 jin per hectare compared to last year. Currently, all farms have completed harvesting and are busily engaged in threshing, drying, and winnowing, preparing to hand over 42.4 million jin of the best soybeans to the state. (Gong Wanzhong)
    Hebei Province, one of the major peanut-producing areas in China, planted over 4.19 million mu of peanuts this year, an increase of over one million mu compared to last year. Although peanuts in some areas suffered from waterlogging due to excessive rain, thanks to the efforts of the masses to quickly drain water and strengthen the later-stage management of the crops, over 3.53 million mu of peanuts in the province are growing well. The average yield per mu is expected to reach over 220 jin, more than 30 percent higher than the average yield last year. Among them, the over one million mu of peanuts in the Tangshan Special District are growing particularly well, with an average yield of over 260 jin per mu. The peanuts produced in many areas such as Jiucheng in Shulu County, Shijiazhuang Special District, are full, bright white in color, and of very good quality.
    Before and after the peanut harvest began, propagandists in various places explained the significance of selling peanuts to the state to the broad masses of farmers. Many farmers proposed to "dig every last one and collect them all," and enthusiastically sold the dried peanuts to the state. Currently, the supply of new peanuts on the market in the province is gradually increasing. Miyun County in Tongxian Special District was able to purchase about 200,000 jin of peanut kernels per day around October 10; Funing County in Tangshan Special District was receiving 50,000 to 60,000 jin of small peanuts per day.

### 黑龙江省国营机械农场大豆普遍丰收  河北省大部地区花生可望丰收

    黑龙江省国营机械农场大豆普遍丰收河北省大部地区花生可望丰收
    黑龙江省二十个国营机械农场的二万一千四百多垧大豆丰收。据初步统计，平均每垧产大豆二千二百多斤，比当地农民每垧多收二、三百斤。曙光、集贤等农场的大豆平均每垧产量达二千八百斤。
    为了迅速收完大豆，减少损失，各农场今年共出动了一百三十多台联合收割机。在收割中驾驶手们展开了增产保收竞赛，昼夜连续作业，加快了秋收进度。宁安、曙光等农场的机车组创造了日收割十五垧多大豆的优良成绩；二龙山农场“一七六号”机车组也创造了六个半小时收割十二垧大豆的纪录。通北、九三等农场为了减少损失还采用了横割的办法；宝泉岭农场在收割时，大部职工都带着布袋下地捡拾掉落的豆荚，每人一天可捡三十斤大豆。因此，今年各农场收割损失不超过百分之三，每垧大豆可比去年增产四十斤。目前各农场都已收割完毕，正紧张进行脱壳、晒干、扬净工作，准备将四千二百四十万斤最好的大豆上缴给国家。　（宫万钟）
    我国花生主要产区之一的河北省，今年共种花生四百一十九万多亩，比去年增加一百多万亩。部分地区的花生曾因雨多受涝，由于广大群众抓紧排水，并加强作物的后期管理，全省仍有三百五十三万多亩花生生长良好，每亩平均产量预计可达二百二十多斤，比去年的平均产量高百分之三十以上。其中唐山专区的一百多万亩花生生长得特别好，平均每亩可产二百六十多斤。石家庄专区束鹿县旧城一带等许多地区产的花生，都颗粒饱满，色泽鲜白，质量很好。
    开始收刨花生的前后，各地宣传员向广大农民说明了把花生卖给国家的意义。许多农民提出要“刨光，收净”，并把花生晒干后踊跃卖给国家。目前，该省新花生上市量正日渐增加。通县专区密云县在十月十日前后已能每天收购花生米二十万斤左右；唐山专区抚宁县日收小花生果五、六万斤。
