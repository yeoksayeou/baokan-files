Henan Province Tobacco Region Farmers
Strive to Exceed Tobacco Leaf Production Quota

    Farmers in major tobacco-producing areas of Henan Province, such as Xuchang, Anyang, Shangqiu, and Xinyang, have proposed to exceed the tobacco leaf production quota by 500,000 jin to support the country's socialist industrialization. Driven by mutual aid and cooperation organizations, farmers in various tobacco-producing areas, in addition to baking or drying all the bottom and top leaves of early and late tobacco, have also researched and promoted the cultivation of second-crop tobacco (leaving one bud on each plant before and after harvesting the early tobacco and strengthening management can grow some leaves). According to incomplete statistics from five counties including Xuchang and Xiangcheng, 72,568 mu of second-crop tobacco have been cultivated. It is estimated that more than 200,000 mu of second-crop tobacco are cultivated in various tobacco-producing areas. At present, the second-crop tobacco is growing vigorously, generally with four or five leaves per plant. The second-crop tobacco with earlier bud retention is already one to two chi high, with fourteen or fifteen leaves, almost catching up with the growth of local late tobacco. More than 1,000 mu of second-crop tobacco in Shuangmiao Township, Xiangcheng County, has begun to be harvested and baked, yielding about 70 jin of tobacco leaves per mu. Currently, farmers in various tobacco-producing areas are carrying out timely topping and budding, shallow hoeing to preserve moisture, preventing and controlling green worms, and removing weeds from the ground according to the soil fertility and the growth of second-crop tobacco, so as to promote the early maturity and increased production of second-crop tobacco.

    河南省产烟区农民
    努力争取超额增产烟叶
    河南省许昌、安阳、商邱、信阳等主要产烟区农民，提出要超额增产五十万斤烟叶，支援国家社会主义工业化。在互助合作组织带动下，各产烟区农民除把早烟和晚烟的脚叶、顶叶全部烘烤或晒制外，又研究和推广了培育二茬烟（早烟采收前后每株留一个?子，再加强管理可长出一些叶）。据许昌、襄城等五个县不完全统计，培育二茬烟七万二千五百六十八亩。估计各产烟区培育二茬烟有二十多万亩。目前二茬烟生长旺盛，一般每株有四、五个叶。留?较早的二茬烟已有一尺到二尺高，有十四、五个叶，差不多赶上了当地晚烟的生长情况。襄城县双庙乡的一千多亩二茬烟，已开始采收烘烤，每亩收烟叶七十斤左右。现在各产烟区农民正根据地力和二茬烟的生长情况，进行适时打顶打?、浅锄保墒、防治青虫和拔除地内青草，促使二茬烟早熟、增产。　（新华社）
