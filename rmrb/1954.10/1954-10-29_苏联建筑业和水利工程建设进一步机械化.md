Further Mechanization of Soviet Construction and Water Conservancy Projects
New Methods for Building High-Rise Buildings
A new seven-story building is now being built in a new sand area in Moscow using new methods. This building has no frame, but is built with large prefabricated reinforced concrete panels. It only takes three installation workers, one crane operator, one welder, and a few workers specializing in painting and decoration to complete all the construction work.

A TASS reporter, after visiting the construction site, reported that the construction site of this house has an unusual scene. There are no bricks or wood, only neatly stacked large prefabricated reinforced concrete panels, which are ready-made structures. Whether it is the outer and inner walls, floors and partitions, they are transported from a nearby construction site for installation. A five-ton crane lifts the prefabricated panel with a window and places it on the foundation. After the installation workers install it, a welder welds it firmly to the adjacent prefabricated panel. Thus, the outer wall of a room is completed. Its exterior is brushed with a layer of decorative concrete. Its interior does not need to be plastered, just painted.

With another move of the crane, the inner wall of the room is quickly installed. The floor is also installed with a crane. The ceiling of the room on the lower floor is also the floor of the room on the upper floor.

This method of building houses with large prefabricated panels completely mechanizes the entire construction process and turns the construction site into a conveyor device. This greatly reduces the time required for construction and reduces the physical labor of workers. This method was first applied in Magnitogorsk in the Urals. There, a four-story house with thirty-two rooms was built by only ten people working in two shifts, averaging twenty-eight to thirty working days.

Giants More Powerful Than "Prairie Giants"
The Soviet Union continues to create various new construction machines to further mechanize the construction of water conservancy projects. The automatic mobile excavator currently manufactured in the Soviet Union, with a bucket of twenty cubic meters, is 30% larger than the existing automatic mobile excavator known as the "Prairie Giant." The new Kramatorsk Machine Factory recently designed an electric track-type earth excavator with a bucket of fifteen cubic meters, which can excavate 13,000 to 15,000 cubic meters of soil per day and night. Dump trucks are also being further improved. In the past, dump trucks unloaded goods to the rear. Now, a dump truck is being designed that not only unloads goods to the rear, but also unloads goods to both sides at the same time, which can make unloading work simpler and faster. In order to further improve the level of mechanization of laborious concrete engineering operations, the Soviet Union is designing a new device to mechanize the unloading of cement from trains and barges.

Due to the development of the production of various construction machines, the level of mechanization of construction work in Soviet water conservancy projects is increasing day by day. At present, in the construction of major hydropower stations in the Soviet Union, 97.5% of earthwork and 98.8% of the manufacture and pouring of concrete have been mechanized. Thousands of excavators, bulldozers, scrapers, and 25-ton dump trucks are working on the construction sites. In concrete engineering, the entire production process, from the unloading of cement, gravel, and sand to the loading of concrete into buckets, is mechanized. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 苏联建筑业和水利工程建设进一步机械化

    苏联建筑业和水利工程建设进一步机械化
    建筑高楼大厦的新方法
    莫斯科市的新砂区现在正用新方法建筑一幢七层楼的新大厦。这座建筑物没有构架而是用大块钢筋混凝土预制板建筑。完成全部建筑工作只需要三个安装工人、一个起重机操使者、一个焊接工人和几个专作粉刷修饰的工人就够了。
    塔斯社记者在访问了这个工地以后报道说：这座房屋的建筑工地有着不平常的景象。那里看不到砖头或木料，只看得到堆放得很整齐的大块钢筋混凝土预制板，这些预制板本身就是现成的结构。不论外墙和里墙、地板和隔墙，都是从一个附近的建筑场运来安装的。一部五吨重的起重机把有一扇窗户的预制板举起，放在墙基上。安装工人把它安装好之后，一个焊接工人就把它牢牢地同旁边的预制板焊接起来。于是，一个房间的外墙就完成了。它的外表刷上一层装饰用的混凝土。它的里面不需要涂灰泥只要油漆一下就行了。
    起重机再动一动，这个房间的内墙也就迅速地安装起来。地板也是用起重机安装的。下面一层楼的房间的天花板，同时也就是上面一层楼的房间的地板。
    这种用大块预制板建造房屋的方法使整个建筑过程完全机械化，并把建筑工地变成一个输送装置。这样就大大地减少了建筑所需要的时间，减轻了工人的体力劳动。这种方法第一次是在乌拉尔的马格尼托哥尔斯克应用的。在那里，一幢有三十二个房间的四层楼房屋，只要十个人分两个班工作，平均用二十八到三十个劳动日就建成了。
    比“草原巨人”更有力的巨人
    苏联继续创制各种新式建筑机器，使水利工程的建设进一步机械化。苏联现在制造的一种掘斗为二十公方的自动移动挖掘机，比号称“草原巨人”的现有的自动移动挖掘机的掘斗还大百分之三十。新克拉马托尔斯克机器工厂最近设计的一种电动炼轨式掘土机，掘斗有十五立方公尺，一昼夜能掘土一万三千到一万五千公方泥土。自卸卡车也在进一步改善。过去自卸卡车是向后面卸货的。而现在正在设计的一种自卸卡车，不仅向后面卸货，而且还同时向两边卸货，这可使卸货工作简便和迅速得多。为了进一步提高混凝土工程费力操作的机械化水平，苏联正在设计一种使水泥从火车和驳船上卸下的工作机械化的新装置。
    由于各种建筑机器的生产的发展，苏联水利工程中建设工作机械化水平日益提高。目前苏联各大水电站建设工程中，土方工作百分之九十七点五，制造和浇灌混凝土的工作百分之九十八点八已机械化，有成千成万台挖掘机、推土机、铲土机、载重二十五吨的自卸卡车在工地上工作。在混凝土工程中，从启卸水泥、石子、砂子一直到混凝土装桶，整个生产过程都机械化了。　（据新华社讯）
