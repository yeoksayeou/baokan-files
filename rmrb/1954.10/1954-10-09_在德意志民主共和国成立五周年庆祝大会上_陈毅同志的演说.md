Comrades and Friends:
    On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, I extend my heartfelt congratulations on the grand festival of the 5th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, and take this opportunity to extend warm respect to the German people!
    In 1945, after the heroic Soviet army crushed the rule of Hitlerite fascism, the people of East Germany, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, confiscated the property of monopoly capitalists and war criminals in their territory and returned the land of Junkers and nobles to the laboring peasants. The people of East Germany seized the political power in urban and rural areas, gradually eliminated the remnants and influence of fascism, and thus laid the foundation for an anti-fascist democratic regime. On October 7, 1949, the people of East Germany established their own German Democratic Republic. The progressive people of the world welcome this path of peaceful development opened up by the German people for themselves. They believe that this is not only a great event in the lives of the German people, but also a major event of decisive significance in European history.
    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic has laid a solid foundation for the great movement of the German people to strive for unification, peace, democracy, and independence. Over the past five years, the people of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and President Wilhelm Pieck, and with the sincere and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, have been victoriously implementing the first five-year construction plan towards prosperity and happiness. The industrious and creative people of the German Democratic Republic have worked selflessly to build their motherland and have achieved great successes in economic construction and the development of cultural undertakings.
    In the industrial sector, the foundation of the metallurgical industry has been laid, the production capacity of the machine-building industry has been significantly increased, and many important tasks stipulated in the first five-year plan have been completed ahead of schedule. At the end of 1953, the total industrial output exceeded the target set in the five-year plan by 7 percent. The total output of state-owned industries increased by 74.8 percent, instead of 61.6 percent as stipulated in the plan compared to 1950. The people of the German Democratic Republic are steadily building the foundation for their own prosperous and happy life. In the construction cause, the working class has played a huge leading role.
    The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic distributed more than three million hectares of land formerly occupied by landlords and nobles to landless or land-poor peasants, greatly increasing the production enthusiasm of the peasants. The achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in industrial development have created conditions for further upsurges in agriculture. In the past few years, the first batch of agricultural production cooperatives has been established in accordance with the principle of voluntariness. The number of machine tractor stations serving cooperatives and individual farmers has been increasing, and the technical equipment has been continuously strengthened. All this has resulted in remarkable achievements in agricultural production. This year, grain production, horses, sheep, pigs, and poultry will reach the 1955 levels set in the five-year plan. Farmers' incomes have more than doubled. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the working class has thus established and consolidated the worker-peasant alliance of the German Democratic Republic.
    The German people have a glorious and brilliant great cultural tradition. Germany is the homeland of the founders of scientific socialism and the great teachers of the international working class, Marx and Engels. The German people have given the world great writers and musicians such as Goethe and Beethoven. The German people's achievements in science and technology are also universally recognized. However, before the German people were liberated from Hitler's fascist rule, it was never easy for them to enjoy the fruits of their own creation of culture, art, science and technology. Now, for the first time, the German Democratic Republic has returned the achievements of culture, art, science and technology to the people. It is carrying out extensive cultural activities to bring forth new ideas in culture and art and serve the people.
    The Chinese people are rejoiced and encouraged by all the significant achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in improving the material and cultural life of the people.
    The German Democratic Republic is peace-loving, and it has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany leads the people of the German Democratic Republic and unites the democratic and patriotic forces of the whole of Germany, resolutely striving for the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty, for the peaceful reunification of Germany on a democratic basis, and for the relaxation of international tensions. It resolutely opposes US imperialism's splitting of Germany, reviving German militarism, and turning Germany into a new hotbed of aggression and war. The German Democratic Republic has made great contributions to the great cause of striving for German reunification, striving for European collective security, and safeguarding world peace. Recent facts have proved that the conspiracy of the aggressive forces headed by the US bellicose clique to rearm West Germany, expand hostile military blocs, and create tensions in Europe is increasingly despised; the Soviet Union's proposals for establishing European collective security and guaranteeing world peace have been increasingly supported by the peace-loving German people, the European people, and the people of the world. However, the Western countries headed by the United States have not abandoned the conspiracy to split Germany and revive German militarism because of the bankruptcy of the "European Defense Community." At the recent nine-nation conference in London, they decided to rearm West Germany and attempted to drag West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty military bloc under another guise. This action, which violates the interests of the German people and endangers European and world peace, will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the peace-loving German people, the European people, and the people of the world. The Chinese people will continue to fully support the German people in their great struggle for the unification, peace, democracy, and independence of their motherland. The German people's desire for unification, peace, democracy, and independence will surely be realized.
    There is a deep friendship between the Chinese and German people. The establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic has opened a new era of friendly cooperation between our two peoples. Over the past five years, trade between our two countries has expanded year by year, technical cooperation is underway, and cultural exchanges are becoming increasingly broad and deep. The talks between the premiers of our two countries in July this year further consolidated and developed the friendly and cooperative relations between the two peoples. The friendly cooperation between our two peoples not only conforms to the interests of the peaceful construction of the two peoples, but also will greatly help to strengthen the peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union and safeguard the cause of world peace.
    Long live the German Democratic Republic!
    Long live the fraternal friendship between the people of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic!
    Long live the unity of the world's peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic!

    在德意志民主共和国成立五周年庆祝大会上
    陈毅同志的演说亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，衷心地祝贺德意志民主共和国建国五周年的盛大节日，并借此机会向德意志人民致以热烈的敬意！
    一九四五年英雄的苏联军队粉碎了希特勒法西斯统治以后，东德人民在德国统一社会党的领导下在自己的领土上没收了垄断资本家和战犯的财产，把容克地主和贵族的土地归还给劳动农民。东德人民掌握了城乡政权，逐渐肃清了法西斯的残余和影响，从而奠定了反法西斯的民主政权基础。一九四九年十月七日，东德人民建立了自己的德意志民主共和国。全世界进步人类欢迎德意志人民为自己开辟的这一和平发展的道路。他们认为这不仅是德意志人民生活上的伟大事件，并且是欧洲历史上有着决定意义的重大事件。
    德意志民主共和国的成立为德意志人民争取统
  一、和平、民主、独立的伟大运动建立了坚固的基础。五年来德意志民主共和国人民在德国统一社会党和威廉·皮克总统的领导下，在伟大苏联真诚无私的援助下，正在胜利地实现着走向繁荣和幸福的第一个五年建设计划。勤劳而富于创造性的德意志民主共和国人民为了建设自己的祖国，进行了忘我的劳动，在经济建设和发展文化事业各方面获得了巨大的成就。
    在工业方面，冶金工业基础奠定了，机器制造工业的生产能力显著地增加了，第一个五年计划中规定的许多重要任务已经提前完成了。一九五三年年底工业总产量比五年计划中所规定的目标超过了百分之七，国营工业的生产总量，不是像计划规定的比一九五○年增加百分之六十一点六，而是增加了百分之七十四点八。德意志民主共和国人民正在稳步地建立自己繁荣幸福生活的基础。在建设事业中，工人阶级发挥了巨大的带头作用。
    德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府把过去为地主贵族所占有的三百万公顷以上的土地分配给无地或少地的农民，大大地提高了农民的生产热情。德意志民主共和国在工业发展方面所获得的成就又为农业的进一步高涨创造了条件。在过去几年里，第一批农业生产合作社已经根据自愿的原则建立起来。替合作社和个体农民服务的机器拖拉机站的数量不断增加，技术设备不断加强。这一切就使农业生产获得了显著的成绩。今年谷物生产、马匹、羊、猪和家禽的头数将达到五年计划中的一九五五年的水平。农民的收入增加了两倍多。在德国统一社会党的领导下，工人阶级就这样同农民建立并巩固了德意志民主共和国的工农联盟。
    德意志人民是有着光辉灿烂的伟大文化传统的。德国是科学的社会主义创始人和国际工人阶级伟大导师马克思和恩格斯的祖国。德意志人民给了世界像哥德和贝多芬这样伟大的作家和音乐家。德意志人民在科学技术上的成就也是举世公认的。但是德意志人民在从希特勒的法西斯统治下解放出来以前，从来是不容易享受他们自己所创造的文化艺术和科学技术的成果的。现在，德意志民主共和国第一次把文化艺术和科学技术的成果还给人民，它正在开展着广泛的文化活动，使文化艺术推陈出新，为人民服务。
    中国人民对于德意志民主共和国在提高人民的物质和文化生活方面所取得的这一切重大成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    德意志民主共和国是爱好和平的，它一贯地奉行和平的外交政策。德国统一社会党领导着德意志民主共和国人民并团结着全德意志的民主爱国力量，坚决争取尽速缔结和约，争取德国在民主基础上的和平统一和争取缓和国际紧张局势。它坚决反对美帝国主义分裂德国，复活德国军国主义，变德国为侵略和战争的新的温床。在争取德国统一，争取欧洲集体安全和维护世界和平的伟大事业中，德意志民主共和国作了很大的贡献。最近许多事实证明：以美国好战集团为首的侵略势力企图在欧洲重新武装西德、扩大敌对的军事集团以制造紧张局势的阴谋日益受人唾弃；苏联主张建立欧洲集体安全和保障世界和平的各项建议，已经越来越受到爱好和平的德意志人民、欧洲人民和世界人民广泛的支持。但是，以美国为首的西方国家，并没有因为“欧洲防务集团”的破产而放弃分裂德国和复活德国军国主义的阴谋。它们最近在伦敦九国会议上又决定重新武装西德并企图用另外一个幌子把西德拖入北大西洋公约军事集团。这种违背德意志人民的利益、危害欧洲和世界和平的行动，必然将会遭到爱好和平的德意志人民、欧洲人民和全世界人民的坚决反对。中国人民将继续全力支持德意志人民为争取自己祖国的统一、和平、民主、独立的伟大斗争，德意志人民为争取统一、和平、民主、独立的愿望是一定要实现的。
    中国人民同德意志人民之间有着深厚的友谊。中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的成立为我们两国人民开辟了友好合作的新纪元。五年来，我们两国的贸易一年比一年扩大，技术方面的合作正在开展，文化交流也日益广泛深入。今年七月间我们两国总理的会谈进一步巩固和发展了两国人民的友好合作关系。我们两国人民的友好合作不仅符合两国人民和平建设的利益，而且也将大大有助于加强以苏联为首的和平民主力量和保卫世界和平的事业。
    德意志民主共和国万岁！
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国两国人民的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的团结万岁！
    德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克同志万岁！
