Farmers in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces are enthusiastically selling cotton
Farmers in cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province warmly support the policy of state monopoly purchase of cotton and are selling cotton to the state. The agricultural production cooperatives of Qu Yaoli and Wu Chun'an, both nationally famous cotton production models, have already drawn up plans to sell cotton in accordance with state regulations. The agricultural production cooperative where Wu Chun'an is located decided, after discussion by all members, to sell 150,000 jin of cotton to the state. Members of the agricultural production cooperative where Qu Yaoli is located expressed warm support for the state monopoly purchase policy based on their personal experiences. Member Du Fajia said, "Only when the state controls cotton can speculation by private merchants be stopped. In the past, as soon as our cotton was harvested, private merchants would lower the price. When we farmers needed cotton, they would raise the price again. They really exploited us inside and out." Member Qu Defu said, "Letting private merchants manipulate cotton will affect our country's industrial construction. We must ensure that we don't sell a single jin of cotton to private merchants." The cooperative has now sold more than 30,000 jin of cotton to the state. This spring, the Luo Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jieyu County received a state pre-purchase payment of 6 million yuan, borrowed 800,000 yuan from the credit cooperative, and after the wheat harvest, borrowed another 1.07 million yuan from the state to buy fine fertilizer for the cotton fields. As a result, the cooperative's more than 60 mu of cotton achieved a bumper harvest, with an estimated yield of more than 18,900 jin of seed cotton. When discussing the cotton monopoly purchase policy, the members said: Thanks to the state's support, we have achieved a bumper harvest. Now that the state needs cotton, how can we not sell it! They decided to sell all the surplus cotton to the state, except for the necessary cotton for their own use. The agricultural production cooperatives in eighteen villages, including Dayang, Jiaobei, and Quandu in Linyi County, have successively held member symposiums to discuss the cotton monopoly purchase policy and ensure that they will obey the state plan and enthusiastically sell cotton. By October 10, they had sold more than 547,200 jin of seed cotton to the state.
    Individual farmers who have not yet joined agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams also actively support the state's policy of cotton monopoly purchase. Gao Jiqing, a cotton farmer in Beiguan, Yicheng County, said, "Last year, the state did not implement cotton monopoly purchase, and my family only kept seven jin of cotton. This year, according to state regulations, we are keeping even more than last year, which is enough. I will ensure that I use cotton sparingly and strive to sell more cotton to the state." Many farmers in various regions believe that the state's implementation of cotton monopoly purchase has four major benefits: it can stabilize prices; the price is fair and reasonable, and no longer subject to exploitation by speculators; regardless of how much is harvested, there is no worry about not being able to sell it; and it can save on cotton use and avoid waste.
    Due to the active sale of cotton by farmers in various places in accordance with state plans, the provincial supply and marketing cooperatives had purchased more than 8,322,000 jin of ginned cotton by October 5.

    Farmers in the Guanzhong cotton-producing area of Shaanxi Province are enthusiastically selling cotton to the state. The average daily cotton collection in the main cotton-producing areas such as Jingyang, Sanyuan, and Gaoling is now one to two times higher than in mid-September. According to incomplete statistics from Sanyuan County, the county's supply and marketing cooperative collected a total of more than 2,110,000 jin of cotton in the thirty-five days from the beginning of September to October 5.
    Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places have played a model leading role in selling cotton. Many agricultural production cooperatives immediately organized discussions and formulated cotton sales plans after hearing the news of the implementation of cotton monopoly purchase. The Beichangjia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chang'an County has now sold to the state 48 percent of the cooperative's expected cotton production. The Kong Zongqing mutual aid team in Beiliang Village, Xinzhuang Township, Gaoling County, has sold more than 3,000 jin of ginned cotton to the state from mid-September to early October. Under the leadership of the Kong Zongqing mutual aid team, the entire village has sold more than 14,000 jin of cotton. Farmers in Xixu Village, Xinnong Township, Sanqiao District, Chang'an County, collectively sent 2,500 jin of pre-purchased cotton to the Sanqiao District Supply and Marketing Cooperative on September 28. Gao Junfu, a sixty-four-year-old farmer, personally carried one hundred and thirty jin of cotton with his son and handed it over to the supply and marketing cooperative. He said, "When I was short of money in the spring, the government came forward to help me solve the problems of production and life. Now, I am quickly sending the pre-sold cotton, and I feel worthy of Chairman Mao in my heart."
    After selling cotton to the state, farmers in various places are actively investing the money earned from selling cotton to expand production. After selling cotton, farmers in Beiliang Village, Gaoling County, have bought more than 2,600 jin of chemical fertilizer and 600 jin of bone meal. The Beichangjia Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chang'an County has bought back 5,000 jin of chemical fertilizer and 1,500 jin of bone meal and is now preparing to purchase and exchange good livestock.

    山西陕西两省农民踊跃出卖棉花
    山西省各产棉区的农民热烈拥护棉花统购政策，纷纷把棉花卖给国家。全国著名的棉花丰产模范曲耀离和吴春安所在的农业生产合作社，都已经订出按照国家规定出卖棉花的计划。吴春安所在的农业生产合作社经全体社员讨论，决定要卖给国家十五万斤棉花。曲耀离所在的农业生产合作社的社员们，根据自己的切身经历，对棉花统购政策表示热烈拥护。社员杜发家说：“只有国家掌握了棉花，才能制止私商投机。过去，咱们的棉花刚收下来，私商就压低棉价。到咱农民需用棉花的时候，他们又抬高价钱。真是里里外外剥削咱们。”社员曲德甫说：“让私商捣弄棉花，就会影响咱们国家的工业建设，咱们要保证不卖给私商一斤棉花。”现在该社已经卖给国家三万多斤棉花。解虞县罗村农业生产合作社今年春天得到国家预购款六百万元，从信用合作社贷款八十万元，麦收以后，又向国家贷款一百零七万元，买了细肥，上在棉田里。因此，全社六十多亩棉花普遍丰收，预计可产籽棉一万八千九百多斤。在讨论棉花统购政策的时候，社员们说：由于国家的扶助，咱们才得到丰收，现在国家需要棉花，咱们哪能不卖！他们决定除留下必要的自用棉外，要把多余的棉花全部卖给国家。临猗县大阳、角杯、泉杜等十八个村的农业生产合作社，都先后召开社员座谈会，讨论了棉花统购政策，并保证服从国家计划，踊跃出卖棉花。到十月十日，他们已卖给国家籽棉五十四万七千二百多斤。
    现在还没有参加农业生产合作社和互助组的单干农民，对国家实行棉花统购的政策也积极拥护。翼城县北关棉农高及庆说：“去年，国家没有实行棉花统购，我家才留了七斤棉花，今年按照国家规定，比去年留的还多，怎么样也够用。我要保证节约用棉，争取把更多的棉花卖给国家。”很多地区的农民认为国家实行棉花统购有四大好处：可以稳定物价；价格公平合理，不再受投机商人的剥削；收多收少，不愁卖不了；能节约用棉，避免浪费。
    由于各地农民积极按照国家计划出售棉花，全省供销合作社到十月五日止，已收购皮棉八百三十二万二千多斤。

    陕西省关中棉产区农民正踊跃卖棉花给国家。泾阳、三原、高陵等主要产棉区现在每天平均收棉数量，都比九月中旬时增加一倍到两倍。据三原县不完全统计，从九月初到十月五日三十五天中，全县供销合作社共收进棉花二百一十一万多斤。
    各地农业生产合作社和互助组在卖棉花当中起了模范带头作用。许多农业生产合作社在听到实行棉花统购的消息以后，立即组织讨论，订出卖棉计划。长安县北常家庄农业生产合作社现在已经卖给国家的棉花，占该社棉花预计产量的百分之四十八。高陵县新庄乡北梁村孔宗清互助组，从九月中旬到十月初已经卖给国家三千多斤皮棉。在孔宗清互助组的带动下，全村已经卖出一万四千多斤棉花。长安县三桥区新农乡西许村的农民，在九月二十八日集体到三桥区供销合作社送缴了两千五百斤预购棉。六十四岁的老农高俊福亲自和他的儿子挑送一百三十斤棉花缴给供销合作社。他说：“春上我缺钱使用的时候，政府先拿出钱来帮我解决了生产、生活上的问题，现在，我赶快把预售的棉花送来，心里才觉得对得起毛主席。”
    各地农民把棉花卖给国家以后，积极把卖棉所得的钱投资扩大生产。高陵县北梁村农民卖棉花以后，已经买了化学肥料两千六百多斤、骨粉六百斤。长安县北常家庄农业生产合作社已经买回化学肥料五千斤和骨粉一千五百斤，现在正准备购换好牲口。
