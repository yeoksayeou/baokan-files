    The Soviet delegation attending the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly submitted a proposal to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on October 15 requesting a discussion of "Acts of Aggression against the People's Republic of China and the Responsibility of the United States Navy for These Acts." At the same time, the Soviet delegation submitted a related memorandum pointing out that the American aggression group is turning Taiwan and the China Sea area into a new hotbed of war. This situation, which seriously threatens peace and security in the Far East, proves the necessity of including this urgent and important issue on the General Assembly's agenda.
    The Chinese people unanimously support this proposal from the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, on October 10, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai telegraphed the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, re-lodging the accusation of armed aggression by the United States against China's territory of Taiwan, stating that the Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly should bear the unshirkable responsibility of urging the Security Council to stop the US government's aggression to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and ordering the US government to completely withdraw all US armed forces and all military personnel from Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other islands belonging to China.
    The American acts of aggression accused by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and the Soviet delegation are based on conclusive evidence and cannot be denied. The fact that the United States' aggressive actions are increasingly seriously threatening peace and security in the Far East is also a fact that is obvious to all. Faced with this situation, the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly should include Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's accusation and the Soviet proposal on the agenda, conduct discussions, and condemn and stop the US aggression.
    The US government is clearly attempting to obstruct the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly from seriously addressing the Chinese government's accusation and the Soviet proposal with an attitude of barbarism and unreasonableness. The US delegation has even put pressure on the United Nations, unreasonably demanding that the United Nations Secretary-General not distribute Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's accusing telegram. When the United Nations Secretary-General did not accept this unreasonable demand from the United States, the US delegation even refused to accept the telegram from Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai that the United Nations Secretary-General had distributed to it. After the Soviet delegation's proposal was put forward, the American representative Lodge also wanted to deceive the world, making shameless denials. He even arrogantly said that "the claim that the United States is engaged in acts of aggression in the Taiwan area or anywhere else is completely false." However, the likes of Lodge are simply unable to provide any defense against the undeniable facts of US aggression listed in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's accusing telegram and the Soviet proposal and memorandum.
    As early as August 24, 1950, the accusation submitted by the Government of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations Security Council, and the opinions presented by Wu Xiuquan, the special representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China, who attended the Security Council on November 28 of the same year, had already confirmed, based on various undeniable facts, the crime of the US government's armed aggression against Taiwan. The "Complaint against US Aggression against China" submitted by the Soviet government to the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 20, 1950, and the opinions presented by Soviet representative Vyshinsky at the meeting of the Political and Security Committee of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on November 27 of the same year regarding this complaint, also confirmed the crime of US armed aggression against China. At that time, the US delegation was already in a position of complete moral bankruptcy and was unable to defend the fact that US armed forces were violating China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and violating relevant international agreements.
    As a result of the United Nations failing to take action in accordance with the United Nations Charter in a timely manner, allowing the situation of US aggression against China to continue and develop, the increasingly aggravated aggressive actions of the US aggressors have reached a serious point that is causing widespread unease among all countries that do not want peace in the Far East to be undermined. Now, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has even adopted delaying tactics, deciding to postpone a decision on the Soviet delegation's proposal. This behavior of the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly can only continue to encourage the United States' policy of aggression. We believe that the Soviet proposal must be quickly placed on the agenda and discussed as a matter of priority in order to stop the US aggressive actions that endanger peace in the Far East in a timely manner and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.
    The US government has long admitted that not interfering in the Taiwan situation with armed forces is the unshakable obligation of the United States or any other foreign or international organization, and that violating this obligation is interfering in China's internal affairs and undermining China's territorial integrity, and is violating the basic principles of the United Nations. The "Policy Propaganda Instructions on Taiwan" issued by the US State Department on December 23, 1949, wrote: "We should make it clear when necessary that the United States acquiring bases in Taiwan, sending troops there, supplying weapons, sending naval ships there, or taking any similar actions, will involve the United States in a long-term adventure, which, if handled well, will create a new stalemate area; if handled poorly, it may lead to open war. It also exposes the United States to a fierce propaganda offensive, especially the Chinese people will oppose our militarism, imperialism, and interference." On January 5 and 9, 1950, the US government successively issued statements guaranteeing respect for China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and not interfering in the Taiwan situation with armed forces or political means. However, in recent years, the United States has gone back on its word and broken its promises, carrying out increasingly rampant armed aggression and interference against China's territory of Taiwan. These aggressive activities of the US government have aroused widespread condemnation from world opinion. Can the likes of Lodge say that this is "completely false"?
    Recently, the adventurous aggressive activities intensified by the US aggression group have become even more blatant. A report by Neil Stanford, a reporter for the US "Christian Science Monitor" on October 8, admitted that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group's "continued existence in Taiwan and all its hopes of regaining the mainland depend on US support and assistance." "There is a military mission in Washington stationed in Taiwan to train and help the Kuomintang army use US-supplied equipment. Protecting Taiwan from invasion (!) is the responsibility of the US Seventh Fleet, and therefore also the responsibility of the US Navy." At the same time, this reporter also acknowledged the well-known fact that the harassment and destructive war recently carried out by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group against our cities and coastal areas "is with the consent of the US government"; "The fact that he (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group) must rely almost entirely on the United States for Taiwan's security and to obtain large amounts of ammunition makes any requirements or suggestions made by the United States almost have the force of an order." Are these facts reported in the US prestigious bourgeois newspapers also what the likes of Lodge call "completely false"?
    It must be pointed out that it is precisely the US aggression group itself that urgently needs to beg for the despicable means of spreading rumors and slanders in order to confuse public opinion and conceal US crimes. US Ambassador to the United Nations Lodge fabricated and distorted facts on a large scale on September 19, maliciously slandering the People's Republic of China for "attacking" foreign ships and planes, attempting to use this to cover up the US aggression group's acts of violating China's territorial sovereignty, air-dropping special agents to China for espionage activities, and assisting and instigating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to intercept and attack merchant ships on the high seas. However, this trick of the likes of Lodge is also very clumsy and will definitely not achieve its goal. Among the thirty-nine incidents listed by Lodge in which he slandered our country for "attacking" foreign merchant ships, twenty-two were purely fabricated; the actual circumstances of another twelve were also completely different from what Lodge said. Lodge even included incidents in which US planes and ships openly invaded China's airspace and territorial waters to carry out armed provocations against the Chinese people. For example, on March 21, 1953, the US yacht "Cutter" was detained by us for invading our Guangdong territorial waters for reconnaissance activities. The people on board confessed to illegal activities and were expelled from the country in September 1954. Only five cases have been identified as being of a misunderstanding nature, most of which have been resolved by our government and relevant parties through consultation; and these misunderstanding incidents were entirely caused by the US aggression group illegally creating a tense situation in the Chinese coastal areas. Facts have proved that the unbridled piracy carried out by the United States in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group is a criminal step in the United States' aggression against the People's Republic of China, which the likes of Lodge can absolutely not conceal.
    The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate all these acts of aggression by the United States. All peace-loving countries and far-sighted people believe that US aggression against China must be stopped. However, what deserves people's heightened vigilance is that the US aggression group is making every effort to spread an atmosphere, pretending to want to "reduce" some aggressive activities, in order to ease and escape the condemnation of world opinion. Those who succumb to the United States' policy of aggression and the United States' increasing pressure are also advocating absurd propositions such as "neutralizing" Taiwan, and even do not hesitate to threaten the Chinese people who are carrying out the just struggle to liberate Taiwan. On the surface, they want the public to place their hopes on the "self-restraint" of the US aggressors and the so-called "restraint" on the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, but in reality they are supporting and encouraging the United States' policy of aggression against Taiwan. There is no doubt that the absurd proposition of so-called "Taiwan neutralization" can only benefit the expansion of US aggression and is not conducive to maintaining peace. The Chinese people express their firm opposition to this absurd proposition. Sober public opinion must expose the conspiracies and tricks of the United States and its followers.
    The United Nations must stop these acts of aggression by the United States in order to uphold the sacred principle of the United Nations Charter of defending international peace and security. The Chinese people resolutely oppose US aggression and interference, and will liberate Taiwan, never ceasing until the goal is achieved.

### 联合国必须追究美国侵略的责任

    联合国必须追究美国侵略的责任
    出席联合国大会第九届会议的苏联代表团，在十月十五日向联合国大会主席提出了要求讨论“关于侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”的问题的提案。同时，苏联代表团提出了有关的备忘录，指出美国侵略集团正在把台湾和中国海区域变成一个新的战争温床，这一严重威胁远东和平和安全的局势，证明有必要把这个紧急而重要的问题列入大会议程。
    中国人民一致支持苏联的这个提案。大家知道，我国外交部长周恩来已在十月十日致电联合国大会第九届会议，重新提出了对美国武装侵略中国领土台湾的控诉，表示中华人民共和国政府认为联合国大会第九届会议应该负起义不容辞的责任，促使安全理事会制止美国政府为了干涉中国人民解放台湾而进行的侵略行为，并责令美国政府自台湾、澎湖列岛和其他属于中国的岛屿完全撤走美国的各种武装力量和一切军事人员。
    周恩来外长和苏联代表团所指责的美国侵略行为，都是证据确凿，不能辩解的。美国的侵略行为日益严重地威胁到远东的和平和安全，也是有目共睹的事实。面对这一局势，联合国大会第九届会议应将周恩来外长的控诉和苏联的提案列入大会议程，进行讨论，并谴责和制止美国的侵略行为。
    美国政府显然企图以横蛮无理的态度，阻挠联合国大会第九届会议认真对待中国政府的控诉和苏联的提案。美国代表团居然对联合国施加压力，无理要求联合国秘书长不要分发周恩来外长的控诉电文。当联合国秘书长没有接受美国的这个无理要求时，美国代表团竟拒绝接受联合国秘书长分发给它的周恩来外长的电文。当苏联代表团的提案提出后，美国代表洛奇还想一手遮尽天下耳目，进行无耻的抵赖。他竟狂妄地说“说美国在台湾地区或在任何其他地方从事侵略行动的说法，完全是谎话。”但是，洛奇之流却根本无法对周恩来外长的控诉电文和苏联的提案和备忘录中列举的无可否认的美国进行侵略的种种事实，作任何的辩解。
    中华人民共和国政府早在一九五○年八月二十四日向联合国安全理事会提出的控诉，和中华人民共和国政府特派代表伍修权在同年十一月二十八日出席安理会陈述的意见，就已经根据各种无可否认的事实，证实了美国政府武装侵略台湾的罪行。苏联政府在一九五○年九月二十日向联合国大会第五届会议提出的“关于美国侵略中国的控诉案”和苏联代表维辛斯基在同年十一月二十七日联合国大会第五届会议政治和安全委员会会议上就这一控诉案陈述的意见，也同样证实了美国武装侵略中国的罪行。当时，美国代表团就已经完全处于道义上彻底破产的地位，丝毫无法辩解美国武装部队侵犯中国主权和领土完整、违反有关的国际协议的事实。
    由于联合国未能及早采取符合于联合国宪章的行动，听任美国侵略中国的局势继续存在和发展的结果，美国侵略者变本加厉的侵略行为，已到了任何不愿远东和平遭到破坏的国家所普遍感到不安的严重地步。现在联合国大会总务委员会竟又采取拖延策略，决议对苏联代表团的提案延迟作出决定。联合国大会总务委员会的这种行为，只能继续鼓励美国的侵略政策。我们认为苏联提案必须迅速列入议程并尽先进行讨论，以便及时制止美国危害远东和平的侵略行动，保障亚洲和世界的和平。
    美国政府早就自己承认：不以武装力量干涉台湾局势乃是美国或其他任何外国或国际组织的不可动摇的义务，违背这个义务就是干涉中国内政和破坏中国领土完整，就是违背联合国的基本原则。一九四九年十二月二十三日，美国国务院发表的“关于台湾的政策宣传指示”，就写道：“我们应该在必要时说明白，美国在台湾取得基地、派军队去、供应武器、派海军船只去，或者采取任何类似的行动，都将使美国卷入长期的冒险中，这种冒险弄得好是造成新的僵持地区；弄得不好可能卷入公开战争。它并且使美国遭到猛烈的宣传攻势，特别是中国人民都将反对我们的军国主义、帝国主义和干涉”。一九五○年一月五日和九日，美国政府又先后发表声明，保证尊重中国的主权和领土完整，而不以武装力量或政治手段干涉台湾的局势。但是，这几年来，美国却背信弃义，自食前言，对中国领土台湾进行了越来越猖狂的武装侵略和干涉。美国政府的这些侵略活动，引起了世界舆论广泛的谴责。洛奇之流难道能说这“完全是谎话”吗？
    最近美国侵略集团加紧进行的冒险侵略活动更加露骨。十月八日美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者尼尔·斯坦福的报道，就承认蒋介石卖国集团“在台湾的继续存在及其对夺回大陆所抱的一切希望都依赖于美国的支持和援助。”“华盛顿有一军事使团驻在台湾去训练和帮助国民党军队使用美国提供的装备。保护台湾不受侵犯（！）是美国第七舰队的责任，因而也是美国海军的责任。”同时，这个记者还承认了众所周知的事实：最近蒋介石卖国集团疯狂地对我国城市和沿海地区进行的骚扰性和破坏性的战争，“是得到美国政府的同意的”；“为了台湾的安全以及得到大量的军火，他（指蒋介石卖国集团）必须几乎完全依靠美国这一事实，使得美国提出的任何要求或建议几乎具有一道命令的力量。”在美国有地位的资产阶级报纸所报道的这些事实，难道也是洛奇之流所说的“完全是谎话”吗？
      必须指出，正是美国侵略集团自己才急需乞求于造谣诽谤的卑鄙手段，来混淆视听，掩饰美国的罪行。美国驻联合国代表洛奇就曾在九月十九日大肆捏造和歪曲事实，含血喷人，诬蔑中华人民共和国
  “袭击”外国船只和飞机，企图借此掩饰美国侵略集团侵犯中国领土主权、空投特务来中国进行间谍活动，并协助和唆使蒋介石卖国集团在公海上拦劫和袭击商船等等侵略行为。但是，洛奇之流的这一手段，也是非常拙劣的，是绝对达不到目的的。在洛奇所列举的诬蔑我国“袭击”外国商船的三十九件事件中，有二十二件是纯属捏造；另有十二件的实际情况，也与洛奇所说的情况完全不同。洛奇竟把美国飞机和舰艇公然侵入中国领空和领海，向中国人民实行武装挑衅的事件，也包括在内。如一九五三年三月二十一日美国游艇“克特号”因侵入我广东领海进行侦察活动而被我扣留，艇上人员供认不法行为，于一九五四年九月被我驱逐出境的事件，就是例子。只有五件已查明是属于误会性质，其中大部分已由我国政府负责和有关方面协商解决；而这些误会事件，也完全是由于美国侵略集团在中国沿海横行不法地制造紧张局势所造成。事实证明，美国勾结蒋介石卖国集团进行的肆无忌惮的海盗行为，是美国侵略中华人民共和国的一个罪恶步骤，这是洛奇之流绝对无法掩饰的。
    中国人民绝对不能容忍美国的这一切侵略行为。所有珍视和平的国家和有远见的人士，都认为必须制止美国对中国的侵略。但是，值得人们提高警惕的是，美国侵略集团正在竭力企图散布一种空气，装作想“缩小”一些侵略活动的样子，来缓和和逃避世界舆论的谴责。那些屈从于美国的侵略政策和美国日益增加的压力的人，又鼓吹所谓台湾
  “中立化”之类的荒谬主张，甚至不惜对进行解放台湾的正义斗争的中国人民进行威胁，他们表面上要公众把幻想寄托在美国侵略者的“自制”和所谓对蒋介石卖国集团的“约束”上面，实际上却是支持并鼓励美国对台湾的侵略政策。毫无疑问，所谓
  “台湾中立化”之类的荒谬主张，只能有利于美国的扩大侵略，而不利于维护和平。中国人民对此种荒谬主张表示坚决反对。清醒的公众舆论必须揭穿美国及其追随者的阴谋诡计。
    联合国必须制止美国的这些侵略活动，以维护联合国宪章保卫国际和平和安全的神圣原则。中国人民坚决反对美国的侵略和干涉，一定要解放台湾，不达目的决不休止。
