The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) Headquarters issued a notice requiring ACFIC local organizations at all levels, under the guidance of the local CCP committees, to organize and lead ACFIC members to study in depth the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong's opening speech at the first session of the First National People's Congress, Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, and to implement them with concrete actions.

The notice said: Members must clearly recognize that our country cannot take the capitalist road; there is no other road to take except the only correct socialist road. Therefore, the state must gradually carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country, neither maintaining the status quo nor developing capitalism. This road has already been affirmed by our country's First National People's Congress with a solemn constitution. Faced with this new situation, private industrialists and businessmen can only advance to the great and glorious socialist society and enjoy an increasingly better and happier life, and lay a peaceful and happy foundation for future generations, by earnestly accepting socialist transformation together with the people of the whole country; conversely, if they resist socialist transformation, they will inevitably be spurned by the people and become pitiful creatures weeping in a corner.

The notice also emphasized: Industrialists and businessmen must promote the spirit of patriotism and earnestly abide by the Constitution and laws. In addition to striving to abide by laws and disciplines like the general public, industrialists and businessmen should also be vigilant at all times about their profit-seeking class nature and the resulting negative effects that are detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihood, and take patriotism and law-abiding as their most basic and frequent requirements for themselves; and they must realize that only by sincerely abiding by the Constitution and laws can they truly support the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Only then can they truly support socialist construction and socialist transformation. All economic activities of their enterprises must be effectively subordinate to the administration of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the masses of workers. As ACFIC members who are the backbone of the industrial and commercial circles, they must thoroughly open up in their studies, relate to reality, carry out criticism and self-criticism, relate to their own economic activities, conduct thorough inspections, overcome illegal behaviors, and educate and struggle against illegal behaviors in the industrial and commercial circles. Through the study of the Constitution and other documents, they should improve their patriotic and law-abiding ideology.

The notice concluded: Liberating Taiwan is a serious task for the Chinese people. ACFIC members should actively support the resolution of the former Central People's Government Committee on approving the diplomatic report of Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the call of the joint declaration of various democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan, strengthen work, strengthen unity, and promote industrialists and businessmen to contribute the greatest strength to the liberation of Taiwan.

    中国民主建国会总会向所属地方组织发出通知
    要求深入学习全国人民代表大会会议文件
    中国民主建国会总会发出通知要求民主建国会各级地方组织，在当地中共党委的指导下，组织并领导民建会员深入学习中华人民共和国宪法、毛泽东主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的开幕词、刘少奇委员长关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告和周恩来总理的政府工作报告，并以切实的行动来贯彻实行。
    通知说：会员们都要认识清楚我国不能走资本主义道路，除掉唯一正确的社会主义道路以外，再无其他道路可走。因此国家对于我国的资本主义工商业，就必须逐步进行社会主义改造，既不能维持现状，更不应当发展资本主义。这样的道路已经由我国的第一届全国人民代表大会用庄严的宪法把它肯定下来了。对着这一新形势，私营工商业者只有认真接受社会主义改造，才能同全国人民一道，向伟大光荣的社会主义社会迈进，享受日益美好、幸福的生活，并为子孙万世奠定和平康乐的生活基础；反之，如果抗拒社会主义改造，就必然为人民所唾弃，成为向隅而泣的可怜虫。
    通知还着重指出：工商业者要发扬爱国主义的精神，切实遵守宪法和法律。工商业者除了要同一般人民一样地努力遵守法纪以外，还应随时警惕自己的唯利是图的阶级本质以及由此所产生的不利于国计民生的消极作用，以爱国守法作为对自己的最基本的和最经常的要求；并要认识到：只有真诚地遵守宪法和法律，才是对中国共产党和毛主席的真正拥护。才是对社会主义建设和社会主义改造的真正拥护。要使自己企业的一切经济活动切实地服从国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督。作为工商界骨干分子的民建会员，在学习中要彻底敞开，联系实际，展开批评和自我批评，联系自己的经济活动，很好进行检查，克服违法行为，并对工商界中的违法行为进行教育和斗争，通过宪法和其他文件的学习，提高爱国守法思想。
    通知最后说：解放台湾是中国人民一项严重的任务。民建会员应积极拥护前中央人民政府委员会关于批准政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来的外交报告的决议和各民主党派、各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言的号召，加强工作，加强团结，推动工商业者为解放台湾贡献最大的力量。　（新华社）
