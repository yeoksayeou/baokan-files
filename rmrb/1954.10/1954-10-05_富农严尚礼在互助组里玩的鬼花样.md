Rich Peasant Yan Shangli's Tricks in the Mutual Aid Team
	Mao Qi, Shi Cun
	In Yan Family Village, District One, Mei County, Shaanxi Province, there lived a rich peasant named Yan Shangli. His family owned over a hundred mu of land, a large cart, and four livestock (two mules, one ox, and one donkey). Before and after Liberation, he always needed long-term farmhands, and during busy seasons, he would also hire short-term laborers. In the lean months of February and March, he would seize opportunities to lend money to peasants at high interest rates – all were his usual practices. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the masses’ awareness has been increasing day by day. Three or five families have begun to work together in mutual aid. Yan Shangli's tricks to exploit people became less and less effective. But his heart had not died; he took a turn and started playing new tricks.
	
	Crawling into the Mutual Aid Team
	This spring, the peasants of Yan Family Village actively organized mutual aid teams. This made the rich peasant Yan Shangli uneasy. Because if everyone organized mutual aid teams, he wouldn’t be able to hire long-term farmhands. What should he do? After thinking it over, he came up with a trick. From then on, whenever he went out and met neighbors, he would pretend to be very progressive, saying, "After studying the General Line, my stubborn mind has also cleared up. From now on, I won't hire long-term farmhands anymore. It's better to join a mutual aid team." These nice words from the rich peasant Yan Shangli first convinced his cousin Yan Shangzhi (a middle peasant). Yan Shangzhi immediately thought of the poor peasants Wu Junshan and Yan Youheng, who were worried about not having livestock to form a mutual aid team. So, he said to Wu Junshan and others, "Don't worry about the lack of livestock. Look at my brother Yan Shangli, he has everything. If we can organize him into the mutual aid team, all the problems will be solved." The poor peasants Wu Junshan and others, after hearing these words, thought that the rich peasant had strong livestock, and they forgot about his past exploitation. In this way, the rich peasant Yan Shangli crawled into the mutual aid team.
	
	Three Stone Six Dou of Wheat
	On February 6th (lunar calendar), the mutual aid team held a meeting. At the meeting, besides electing the poor peasant Wu Junshan as the team leader, they also discussed the issue of recording work points and settling accounts. Yan Shangli calculated: Although the poor peasants Wu Junshan, Yan Youheng, and Li Zha had good labor, they only had a total of about twenty-eight mu of land. How many times a year would they use livestock? Wouldn't I end up earning all their wages? Wouldn't this be even more expensive than hiring a long-term farmhand in previous years? He frowned, and a plan came to mind. He said, "In the past, I always paid three stone and six dou of wheat to hire a long-term farmhand. Although we are now helping each other, I have a lot of crops; everyone knows that my family is not well-off. I think we should calculate it based on paying wages! I can only pay three stone and six dou of wheat anyway. Whoever does the work can earn this wage." This sentence was something that everyone had not anticipated; the meeting was silent. Yan Shangli saw that no one was saying anything, so he went out with his cousins. At home, he and his brother Yan Shangren talked for a while. After a long time, the two of them returned to the meeting. After returning, Yan Shangli's trick was revealed by Yan Shangzhi: "You see, my brother has a lot of crops. Even the odd jobs often require one person. Now that he is willing to take out three stone and six dou of wheat, things will be easy. In my opinion, Wu Junshan, Yan Youheng, and Li Zha, you three have less crops, and your families are not very well-off. You three should earn this money. The three of you take turns doing it. No matter how much work he has, there's no need to worry." Then Yan Shangli also said, "Your three families are also pitiful. In February and March, when the new crop is not yet ready, it won't hurt to load a half-dou or a dou in our home." Although he said this, Yan Shangli was still a little guilty; he was afraid that the township cadres would find out and cause trouble in the future, so he came up with another trick: "Three stone and six dou of wheat, calculated, is just one sheng of wheat per day. At the current price of wheat, one sheng of wheat is worth five thousand yuan. If the township asks in the future, just say that our team stipulates a daily wage of five thousand yuan." The poor peasants Wu Junshan and others were confused by these three explanations and two explanations. They thought: Anyway, we are just exchanging labor, we can do it for him when we have time.
	
	One Long-Term Farmhand Became Three
	Spring production began. The middle peasants Yan Shangzhi and Yan Youfu in this team went to work on their own fields because they had livestock; the poor peasants Yan Luoluo and Zhang Liancheng also left because they couldn’t use the rich peasant's livestock. Only the poor peasants Wu Junshan, Yan Youheng, and Li Zha were left to "exchange labor" with the rich peasant to earn the three stone and six dou of wheat. Wu Junshan and the others took turns working for Yan Shangli day by day, and they also had to take time to work on their own crops. Sometimes they couldn’t avoid borrowing Yan Shangli's livestock to plow their land. Who knew that Yan Shangli had it all calculated; how much time each person used the livestock, how much land they plowed, he recorded it all. Before long, his words came out again. He said to Wu Junshan and the others, "We are a mutual aid team. You work for me, and I give you three stone and six dou of wheat; you use my livestock, and you have to pay me wages too. Otherwise, it won't be equal exchange and mutual benefit. One livestock plowing one and a half mu of land counts as one work point; one work point is five thousand yuan." The poor peasants Wu Junshan and others couldn’t come up with the money. Helpless, they had to work more for Yan Shangli. In this way, they worked whether it was their turn or not. Yan Shangli used to hire one long-term farmhand, but now he had become three long-term farmhands. The poor peasants worked for the rich peasant all day long, how could they do their own crops well? Take Wu Junshan as an example, he only had twelve mu of land. Last year, he did it himself, and he weeded the cotton three times and the corn twice. This year was different. Originally, he thought it was great: this year there is a mutual aid team, and we can weed the cotton at least four times, and the corn at least twice. What was the result? When the soil was moist, he had to work for Yan Shangli first, and it was never his turn. When he was weeding cotton for Yan Shangli, he saw the weeds in his own field growing wildly, and he felt really uncomfortable. When he just started to weed his own field, it was almost his turn to work for the rich peasant again. Anxious, he desperately weeded four mu in one day, and his eyes were red; the next day, he still had to endure the pain and work for the rich peasant. He didn’t even finish weeding his own seven mu of cotton twice; the weeds in the cornfield were very high, and he didn’t even weed it once.
	
	"Mutual Aid and Labor Exchange is Not Simple..."
	The poor peasants Wu Junshan and the others worked for the rich peasant for a spring, and the rich peasant only gave the poor peasants Yan Youheng and Li Zha six dou of wheat, three dou each. What problems could three dou of wheat solve? Yan Youheng and Li Zha's families were still in difficulty. Coincidentally, at this time, the supply and marketing cooperative in nearby Hengqu Town was building houses and needed mud workers, with a daily wage of twelve thousand yuan. Yan Youheng and Li Zha discussed it and decided to take advantage of the free time after the rain when they couldn't enter the fields to work as mud workers in Hengqu Town. After working for a day or two, the two rushed back. Even so, Yan Shangli was not satisfied. One day, while Yan Youheng and Li Zha were weeding, Yan Shangli scolded them and made up stories, giving Yan Youheng and Li Zha a lesson, using an analogy: "Mutual aid and labor exchange is really not simple. If you're not careful, something will go wrong. I heard that the Yan Tianfu mutual aid team in our Xibaozi, last year because the labor exchange was not done well, the peas failed. Later, the cadres investigated the cause and asked those families to compensate. Do you think labor exchange is simple or not!" The implication was clear to Yan Youheng and Li Zha. Yan Shangli was unhappy that they had worked as mud workers in Hengqu Town, fearing that it would delay his crops. They were very angry after hearing these words. That night, the "mutual aid team" held a meeting, and Yan Youheng said, "I am a poor peasant, and he is a rich peasant. How can an egg hit a stone?" Before he finished speaking, he angered Yan Shangli. Yan Shangli stood up and said, "I hire people with wheat, and I still have to suffer people's anger! I can't stand this anger, I'm quitting the team." Yan Youheng became even more angry: "You can't stand it, I can't stand it even more, I'm not doing it!" Saying that, he turned around and left. Yan Shangli saw that things had reached a stalemate, so he quickly changed his tone and asked Wu Junshan and Li Zha what to do. Wu Junshan said, "My family has twelve mu of land, and the crops are in that state, I can't do it anymore." Li Zha said, "I'm so old, if they don't do it, I can't stand it even more." If all three of them quit, how would it work? The wheat was about to be harvested. Who would work on so many crops? The wages would be high during the busy season. Yan Shangli thought it was wrong, so he quickly sent his cousin Yan Shangzhi to reconcile with Yan Youheng. After Yan Shangzhi’s persuasion, the storm was finally calmed down. However, from then on, these three poor peasant households began to see through the rich peasant Yan Shangli's poisonous intentions. During the breaks from work, the three people often talked to each other and calculated the hardships of this period.
	During the unified purchase of surplus grain last winter, the cadres advised Yan Shangli to sell grain, but his whole family cried and made a fuss, saying that they had no surplus grain and refused to sell the surplus grain to the state. However, when Yan Shangli realized that Wu Junshan, Yan Youheng, and the others were dissatisfied with him, he suddenly had grain. One day, it was Wu Junshan's turn to work. In the evening, Yan Shangli became very affectionate and said to Wu Junshan, "I heard that your family is pitiful. You also know that my family is not well-off. Anyway, the wheat is about to be harvested, and I can't let you suffer hardships; recently, my family has been eating sorghum and can save a dou of wheat, I think I'll give it to you. Don't tell Yan Youheng and Li Zha about this." Then, Yan Shangli used the same method to give Yan Youheng and Li Zha one dou of wheat each. The three people all thought that Yan Shangli could take care of their difficulties, so they didn't mention the previous things and continued to work. Once, Wu Junshan and the others were chatting together, and everyone talked about Yan Shangli giving them a dou of wheat. It turned out that the rich peasant was playing tricks! At that time, they planned to break ties with the rich peasant. But then they thought: they still had some crops; if they disbanded now, where would they borrow livestock during the busy season? Now they were halfway up the slope, they would just manage, and when the busy season was over, they would separate from him.

	The Exploitation Was So Severe
	The rich peasant's tricks were finally exposed.
	The township cadres discovered the problem and came to inspect. On June 26th, a meeting was held in the village. Yan Shangli's brother Yan Shangren also attended this time. At the beginning of the meeting, the poor peasants Wu Junshan and others proposed to settle the accounts for the work. Yan Shangren pretended to be deaf and dumb, saying, "We agreed in February that the daily wage was five thousand yuan, what's there to settle?" "Are you helping each other, or are you hiring long-term farmhands with three stone and six dou of wheat?" The village cadre couldn't help but come forward to question him. Yan Shangren muttered, "I don't understand the policies, I only know that mutual aid is not losing out to each other; anyway, we didn't give less than three stone and six dou of wheat."
	Was it really not losing out to each other? That was not the case at all. From February to June in the lunar calendar, the three poor peasants worked for Yan Shangli for more than one hundred and twenty days. According to the average wage in the local area, they should have received one million seven hundred and eighty-five thousand yuan. How much wage did Yan Shangli give? For the whole year of twelve months, three stone and six dou of wheat, calculated at the current market price of forty-five thousand yuan per dou, totaled only one million six hundred and twenty thousand yuan. The number of times that the poor peasants used their labor to repay the rich peasant for the use of livestock was even more uncountable. Only the summer harvest that could be remembered was calculated, and the rich peasant should have refunded fourteen thousand yuan in wages. As for the reduced crop yields of the poor peasants due to working for the rich peasant, they didn’t dare to calculate it. Once this simple exploitation account was calculated, everyone was shocked and said, "Good heavens, the exploitation is really severe!" After the meeting, the people in the village were even clearer about this matter. The poor peasant Yan Cunfu and the rich peasant Yan Qingrong used livestock together, and they often looked at the rich peasant's expressions when working. After hearing about the rich peasant Yan Shangli's exploitation, he said, "I will immediately break ties with the rich peasant and join the mutual aid team."
	
	Run Our Mutual Aid Team Well
	The rich peasant Yan Shangli's exploitation was a profound class education for the peasants of Yan Family Village, making everyone more aware of the importance of uniting the middle and poor peasants to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation. The poor peasant Yan Youheng regretted saying, "I used to only see that the rich peasant had livestock, and I forgot his exploitative nature." On this day, he thought of many things. Wasn't the Taibai Collective Farm not far from here originally a group of poor people? But the middle and poor peasants united and took the road of organization, and now they have tall mules and big horses, everything they need… He made up his mind that the next day he would discuss with Wu Junshan and others to draw a clear line with the rich peasant and reorganize the mutual aid team. And he was determined to overcome the difficulties of lacking livestock. The poor peasants Yan Youheng and Wu Junshan were determined to take out five hundred thousand yuan each, and the middle peasants in the team also expressed their willingness to match one million yuan. In this way, buying a livestock would not be a problem. Adding the two livestock originally owned by the middle peasants in the team, there would be a total of three livestock. Just as the village propagandist Yan Quanzhou said to everyone: "Only when we, the poor and hired middle peasants, unite and do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation can we avoid the exploitation of the rich peasants and improve production and live a good life." Many peasants were also moved and said: We must consolidate the mutual aid team; otherwise, if the rich peasants get their foot in the door, in a few years, we will become their long-term farmhands and tenants again. The eight mutual aid teams in the village became even more united.

    富农严尚礼在互助组里玩的鬼花样
    毛锜  石村
    陕西省郿县一区严家庄，有个富农叫严尚礼。他家有一百多亩土地，一辆大车，四个牲口（两个骡子，一头牛，一匹驴）；解放前和解放后，每年都离不了长工，遇着农忙还得叫短工。二三月里青黄不接，瞅空子在农民中放些高利贷，也都是他惯常的能事。近几年来，在党的领导下，群众觉悟一天一天提高了；三家五家，开始搭工互助。严尚礼剥削人的鬼八卦也就越来越不灵验了。但他的心还没有死；转了个弯，又玩起新的花样来了。
    钻进了互助组
    今年开春，严家庄农民积极组织互助组。这使得富农严尚礼不安起来。因为，大家都组织了互助组，他就雇不到长工了。怎么办呢？他想来想去，想出了一个鬼主意。从那时候起，他一出门，碰见邻舍的人，就装得怪进步地说：“学了总路线，我的死脑筋也亮堂了，今后我也不雇长工啦，还是参加互助组好。”富农严尚礼的这些好听话，首先就把他堂弟严尚智（中农）说转了。当时严尚智就想到村上的贫农吴俊山和严有恒等，正在为组织互助组没牲口伤脑筋。于是他就向吴俊山等说：“牲口缺，不用熬煎。你看我哥严尚礼，车马齐全。如果把他组织到互助组里来，啥问题都解决了。”贫农吴俊山等，听了这一番话，想着富农牲口硬梆，也就把他以前剥削人的行为忘掉了。富农严尚礼，就这样钻进了互助组。
      三石六斗麦
    二月六日（农历），互助组开会，会上除选出贫农吴俊山当组长外，就研究记工算账问题。严尚礼在计算了：贫农吴俊山、严有恒、李奓三个人，劳力虽好，可是总共不过二十八亩来土地，一年能使唤几回牲口呢？将来还不是全挣了我的工资？这样下去，不比往年雇个长工还贵吗？他眉头
  一皱，计上心来，就说：“我往年总是出三石六斗麦雇长工；今年虽然咱们互助，但我的庄稼多；我家庭不宽裕，大家也是知道的。我看就按出工资说吧！我还是只能出三石六斗麦，反正将来谁做，谁把这分工资挣了。”这句话是大家事前没有预料到的；当时会场冷场了。严尚礼一看没人言语，就和他堂兄弟出去了，在家里和严尚礼他哥严尚仁，三个人咕咙了一阵；好一会，两个人才又回到会场。回来以后，严尚礼的鬼花样就由严尚智的口中道出来了：“你们看看，我哥的庄稼就是多，光零碎活经常就得一个人。现在他既然愿意拿出三石六斗麦，事情就好办了。依我看，吴俊山、严有恒、李奓，你三个庄稼都少，家里光景也不大好，还是你三个把这钱挣了，三个人轮着做，他的活再多也不愁。”接着严尚礼也说：“你三个家里也可怜，二三月里，青黄不接，有个三长两短，在咱家里装上
  一斗半斗也没啥。”话虽是这样说，严尚礼却总有些作贼心虚；他又怕乡里干部将来检查出来会生麻烦，便又来了一套：“三石六斗麦，算下来，一天刚是一升麦。作现在的麦价说，一升麦值五千元。将来乡上如果问，就说咱组里规定每天工价五千元。”贫农吴俊山等，经这三说两说，也就弄糊涂了。他们想：反正总是变工呢，有空给他做就是了。
      一个长工变成了三个长工
    春季生产开始了。这个组里的中农严尚智，严有福，因为自己有牲口，干自己的去了；贫农严洛洛、张连城，因为使不上富农的牲口，也都各自去了。只剩下为挣三石六斗麦的贫农吴俊山、严有恒、李奓三个人和富农进行“变工”。吴俊山几个，一天一天轮着给严尚礼干，一方面还得抽空作自己的庄稼，有时也免不了套严尚礼的牲口给自己犁点地。谁知严尚礼的心里有数，那个人使唤牲口，使唤了多少时间，犁了多少地，他都一一记了下来。没多久，他的话又出来了。他和吴俊山几个说：“咱们是互助组，你们给我做活，我出的是三石六斗麦；你们用我的牲口，也得给我开工资。不然，就不等价互利了。一个牲口犁亩半地，算一个工；一个工五千元。”贫农吴俊山等拿不出现钱来，没奈何，还得给严尚礼更多做活。这样一来，轮着自己做也做，不轮着自己做也做。严尚礼过去雇一个长工，现在变成三个长工了。贫农整天给富农干了活，自己的庄稼怎么能做好呢？就拿吴俊山说，自己不过十二亩地，去年自己干，棉花还锄了三遍，包谷锄了两遍。今年就不同了。原来他还想得怪美：今年有互助组，棉花起码锄它四遍，包谷最少也锄上两遍。结果呢？墒饱了就得先给严尚礼干，那里轮得上自己。当给严尚礼锄棉花的时候，他看见自己地里杂草长得乱蓬蓬的，心里真难受。在刚下手给自己锄的时候，富农的活又快轮上自己做了。着急了，他一天就拼命锄了四亩，两个眼睛都熬红了；第二天，他仍然得忍着痛给富农干去。自己的七亩棉花，别说锄四遍，连两遍都几乎没有锄完；包谷地里的杂草很高，连一遍也没锄完。
    “互助变工不简单……”
    贫农吴俊山几个，给富农干了一春，富农仅仅给贫农严有恒、李奓六斗麦，一人三斗。三斗麦能解决个啥问题呢？严有恒和李奓家里还是困难。碰巧这个时候附近横渠镇的供销合作社里盖房，需要泥工，每天工价一万二千元。严有恒和李奓一商量，两个人就利用雨后不能进地的空子，到横渠镇去作泥工。作了一两天，两个人就连忙赶回来。就这样，严尚礼也不满意了。这天，当严有恒和李奓正锄地的当儿，严尚礼就推鸡骂狗地胡编硬诌，给严有恒和李奓好像上课一样，打起比方来了：“互助变工真不简单，一不小心就会出毛病。听说咱这西堡子严天福互助组，去年就因为变工没变好，结果豌豆瞎了。后来干部追查出原因，要那几家赔偿。你们看变工简单不简单！”言外之意，严有恒、李奓心里明白。严尚礼是嫌他俩在横渠镇作了泥工，怕误了他的庄稼。他俩听了这话非常气愤。当天晚上“互助组”开会，严有恒说：“我是个贫农，人家是富农，鸡蛋怎么能碰过石头呢？”这话还没说完，就触怒了严尚礼。严尚礼站起来说：
  “我拿麦雇人呢，还受人的气！这闷肚子的气我受不了，我退组。”严有恒越发生气了：“你受不了，我更受不了，我不干了！”说着拧身就走了。严尚礼一看事情弄成僵局了，就连忙改换了口气，问吴俊山和李奓怎么办。吴俊山说：“我家里十二亩地，庄稼做成那个样子，我也干不成了。”李奓说：“我年纪这样大，如果他俩不干，我越发受不了。”三个人都不干了，怎么能行呢？眼看麦子就要搭镰。这么多的庄稼，谁干呢？忙天工价又大。严尚礼一想不对头，就赶紧打发他堂弟严尚智去和严有恒说合。经过严尚智说来说去，一场风波总算平息了。但是，从此以后，这三户贫农已开始看清了富农严尚礼的毒心眼。在作活的空隙，三个人也经常在一块谈起心事，计算这一阵子苦。
    去年冬天统购余粮的时候，干部劝严尚礼卖粮，他全家又哭又闹，说没有余粮，不肯把余粮卖给国家。可是，当严尚礼觉察到吴俊山、严有恒几个对他不满的时候，他就有了粮食了。有一天，轮到吴俊山做活。晚上，严尚礼就显得怪亲热地给吴俊山说：“听说你这个家里可怜。你也知道我家里不宽裕。反正麦也快上场了，总不能叫你受紧迫；最近我家里吃高粱，能积攒下一斗麦，我看还是给你。你不要把这件事告诉严有恒和李奓。”接着，严尚礼又用同样的办法，给了严有恒和李奓各一斗麦。三个人都以为严尚礼能照顾自己的困难，前话也就没提又干起来了。有一回，吴俊山几个在一块说闲话，大家都谈出严尚礼给了自己一斗麦的事情。原来富农是在耍手段啊！当时他们就打算和富农一刀两断。但后来又想：自己多少都还有点庄稼；当下一散伙，忙天到那里借牲口呢？现在拉到半坡里啦，瞎好，忙一毕，咱们和他分开。
      剥削得好厉害啊
    富农的鬼花样终于被戳破了。
    乡干部发现了问题，来作了检查。六月二十六日，在村里开了一个会。严尚礼的哥哥严尚仁这次也到场了。会议一开始，贫农吴俊山等，就提出算活的事情。严尚仁还装聋卖哑地说：“咱们二月间说好的，每天工资五千元，有啥算的呢？”“你究竟是互助呢？还是用三石六斗麦雇长工呢？”村干部也忍不住出面质问了。严尚仁嗫嚅地说：“我不懂政策，只知道互助是两不吃亏；反正三石六斗麦我们没少出。”
    真的两不吃亏吗？根本不是这么回事。从农历二月到六月，三个贫农给严尚礼做了一百二十多天活，按照当地的平均工资计算，就应得一百七十八万五千元。严尚礼给了多少工资呢？全年十二个月，三石六斗麦，按目前市价每斗四万五千元计算，总共才一百六十二万元。贫农用劳力给富农还畜工，还的次数就更计算不清了。仅就夏收中可以记起的算了一下，富农还应退工资十四万元。至于因为给富农做活，贫农庄稼减产，就更不敢算了。这一笔简单的剥削账一经算出，大家都惊骇地说：“好家伙，剥削得真厉害呀！”会后，村上的人更清楚这件事情了。贫农严存福和富农严青荣在一块合用牲口，为做活也常看富农的眉高眼低。这次听了富农严尚礼剥削人的事实，他说：“我马上和富农割断关系，参加到互助组里来。”
    办好咱们的互助组
    富农严尚礼剥削人的事实，对严家庄的农民是一次深刻的阶级教育，使大家更认清了中贫农团结起来搞好互助合作的重要性。贫农严有恒后悔地说：“我以前只看到富农有牲口，就忘记他的剥削本性了。”这一天，他联想到了许多事情。离这儿不远的太白集体农庄，原来也不是一伙穷人吗？但人家中贫农团结在一起走组织起来的路，现在高骡子大马，要啥有啥……他下了决心，第二天他就和吴俊山等研究和富农划清界线，重新组织互助组的事情。并且决心克服缺乏牲口的困难，贫农严有恒和吴俊山决心各自拿出五十万元来，组里的中农也表示愿意搭配一百万元。这样，买一个牲口就不成问题了。加上组里中农原有的两个牲口，就一共有三头牲口了。正像村上的宣传员严全洲给大家说的：
  “只有我们贫雇中农团结起来，搞好互助合作，才能避免富农的剥削，才能提高生产过好日月。”许多农民也感动地说：一定要把互助组巩固好；不然，富农插进脚来，再过几年，咱们又成了人家的长工和佃户了。村上的八个互助组，都更加团结了。
