Saving Cotton is an Important Task for the Textile Industry
Ma Zhongyan

Saving cotton and improving the utilization rate of raw cotton is a regular and important task in cotton textile enterprises. Especially at a time when the growth of raw cotton production cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the textile industry, it is even more necessary to vigorously save cotton.

Since liberation, although the national cotton output has increased significantly year by year, it still cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the textile industry. For example, the total national cotton output in 1953 increased by 165% compared to 1949, while the national cotton cloth sales volume, taking 1950 as 100, reached 343 in 1953. In order to solve the contradiction between production not keeping up with consumption needs, the state has taken measures for the planned purchase and supply of cotton cloth. However, to further solve this contradiction, in addition to requiring farmers to increase the yield per unit area of cotton fields, strengthen field management, ensure the quality of cotton, and appropriately expand cotton fields, it is very important to actively promote saving cotton in existing cotton textile enterprises and other related national economic sectors. Saving cotton is not only an effective way to solve the current problem of raw cotton supply not keeping up with production development in the textile industry, but also can promote the continuous reduction of cotton textile product costs, promote the improvement of enterprise management in cotton textile factories, and lay a good foundation for the long-term implementation of the conservation system in the future.

In recent years, national cotton textile factories across the country have achieved considerable success in saving cotton. In the second quarter of this year, the average cotton consumption per yarn piece in national cotton textile factories across the country was 196.98 kg, a decrease of 0.06 kg compared to the first quarter. If we compare the average unit cotton consumption of cotton textile factories across the country in the first half of this year with last year, the saved raw cotton can spin about 1,780 more yarn pieces and weave more than 60,000 bolts of cloth. Over the past few years, in the process of implementing cotton saving, cotton textile factories have also accumulated a lot of experience in cotton usage management and technical measures.

However, the work of saving cotton is not done very well today. Many factories still have serious waste of raw cotton, and the potential for saving raw cotton is still very large. In the same region, for the same yarn count, and in the same period, the cotton consumption between enterprises varies greatly, sometimes differing by more than 10 kilograms. In the first half of the year, the Southwest Textile Administration's cotton consumption greatly exceeded the standard quota, with cotton consumption per yarn piece generally as high as 200 kg or more. Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mills No. 8 and No. 13, etc., exceeded the originally planned cotton consumption by about 1.5% in the first quarter of this year, with an average cotton consumption per yarn piece reaching about 205 kg. The phenomenon of wasting raw cotton is also very serious in cotton textile factories in the Northwest region, such as discarding white cotton at will and using good cotton to wipe machines.

Many enterprise cadres still do not have a sufficient understanding of the political and economic significance of saving cotton. Therefore, although there are technical and economic indicators for saving cotton, there is a lack of specific measures and strict inspection systems. Some enterprises still do not clearly understand the relationship between the implementation of operational plans and the improvement of technical leadership, and therefore cannot well combine the implementation of operational plans with saving cotton and improving quality.

Some leading cadres and engineering technicians equate saving cotton with ensuring quality. They do not understand that to achieve the goal of saving cotton, it is necessary to strengthen production management and technical leadership. Therefore, they do not try to find more ways to improve production management and technology. They only one-sidedly believe that saving cotton will inevitably lead to a decline in quality. This wrong view has affected the implementation of cotton saving.

The technical key to saving cotton is to strengthen the technical leadership of the opening and cleaning and carding workshops in cotton textile factories. The waste cotton rate of these two workshops accounts for about 80% of the total waste cotton. Due to poor airflow regulation of the current cleaning machines and poor gauge status of the carding machines, many factories have a high amount of waste cotton, low impurity content in the waste cotton, and high content of effective fiber. Therefore, it is currently necessary to put more effort into airflow and gauge. In the opening and cleaning workshop, strengthen raw cotton management, implement package-by-package grading inspection of raw cotton, classify and rank according to the origin of raw cotton and the impurity content, and adjust the mixing components batch by batch to make the mixing components as stable as possible for a long time. When carrying out this series of work, in addition to systematically conducting special research on some issues and strengthening technical measures, it is also necessary to gradually establish various technical management systems for the opening and cleaning and carding workshops to achieve the purpose of rationally using raw cotton, fully utilizing mechanical performance, improving impurity removal efficiency, and ensuring the quality of semi-finished products. In addition, controlling the relative humidity in the opening and cleaning room, maintaining a certain moisture content of raw cotton, opening airflow doors on the walls of the carding room, setting up cotton drying rooms, and strictly managing the opening and closing of doors and windows in the opening and cleaning room have a direct impact on improving impurity removal efficiency. If the impurity removal efficiency of the opening and cleaning room can reach more than 75% and the impurity removal efficiency of the carding machine can reach more than 80%, it will create favorable conditions for the subsequent processes. In order to ensure that the reuse of waste cotton does not affect product quality, the waste cotton must be properly treated before reuse. The fiber impurity separator that has been widely promoted in various places has proven to be more effective in treating waste cotton. In the future, it can continue to be improved in use.

In addition to strengthening the technical leadership of the opening and cleaning and carding workshops, attention should also be paid to the work of the processes after opening and cleaning and carding. Efforts should be made to reduce fly waste, lap waste, and roving waste, vigorously carry out cleaning work, and reduce fiber loss. Attention should be paid to strengthening maintenance and upkeep work, and on the basis of normal mechanical operation, exert the due effect of technical measures.

In terms of production management for saving cotton, attention should be paid to mastering and improving the yield rate of each process, improving the original records and receipt and payment system, strengthening inventory, accurately calculating the amount of cotton used, and while paying attention to improving the yield rate, it is necessary to control the waste rate, loss rate, and lap waste rate. It is necessary to analyze and study the upward and downward trend of the yield rate month by month. If a waste or lap waste phenomenon is found, research should be conducted, specific methods should be formulated, and control figures should be determined for implementation.

When saving cotton, it is necessary to strengthen technical leadership and technically unify improving quality and saving cotton. It is wrong to only pay attention to improving quality without paying attention to saving raw cotton. But it is also wrong to only emphasize saving cotton without trying to ensure quality. For example, Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Factory mistakenly regarded reusing waste cotton as the only way to save cotton. Therefore, it did not focus on reasonably improving the yield rate as the center and comprehensively conduct technical leadership and arrange technical measures. Management and workers' operations have also gradually become laissez-faire, resulting in a monthly increase in waste cotton and a monthly decrease in the yield rate, forming a serious "large waste and large return" phenomenon. In the education and mobilization of technical personnel and the masses of workers, the emphasis was also on trying to reuse waste cotton as much as possible, and the masses were wrongly mobilized to carry out a competition to collect fly waste. For example, workers in the carding workshop, because they were keen on collecting fly waste, were indifferent to the large amount of lap waste and sliver waste caused by not piecing up broken ends and poor piecing up. The spinning workers also only focused their attention on stopping the machine to collect fly waste, relaxing the normal patrol rules and operational improvements. Some workers did not even piece up when they saw a broken end, and even broke off the roving that had not been used up as lap waste. As a result, steel wire waste reached 3% and roving ends also reached 0.8%, exceeding the standards of general factories by a lot. As a result of this "large waste and large return," the figures for cotton consumption have decreased on the surface, but the quality of various yarn counts has a downward trend, which violates the principle of "massively saving cotton on the basis of conscientiously improving quality."

Some cotton textile factory employees also have some incorrect understandings of saving raw cotton. Some believe that "there can be no wool in a sheep pen, and it is inevitable that cotton textile factories waste a little raw cotton." Others believe that saving cotton is troublesome, "and saving a little bit cannot solve any problems." If these ideas are not corrected, it will be difficult to implement measures to save raw cotton. In order to implement saving cotton, cotton textile factories must focus on educating employees on saving cotton, so that all employees understand the economic value and political significance of saving cotton. They must realize that the work of saving raw cotton is a regular task, and accumulating a little bit will add up. In some workshops of Shaanxi Second Cotton Textile Factory, one penny was saved per yarn piece, and in some workshops, several taels were saved. In the second quarter, more than 20,000 catties of raw cotton were saved. These cottons can spin 51 yarn pieces and weave more than 1,800 bolts of cloth, which can provide 13,200 people with a new set of clothes each. If all national cotton textile factories across the country do the same, they can produce a lot more yarn and cloth for the country. In addition, the institutions related to raw cotton management have a more direct impact on saving cotton, such as warehousing and transportation departments paying attention to reducing loss during transportation, warehousing raw cotton paying attention to preventing mildew and dehumidification, opening windows for ventilation, and reducing warehouse waste, which are also very important. The recently held textile technology innovation exhibition in Shanghai highlighted the part on saving cotton and put forward the slogan "Strengthen work in all aspects and strive to save cotton."

Although there have been many achievements and experiences in saving cotton in the past, these experiences have not been well summarized, exchanged, and promoted to improve work. In the future, textile enterprises must pay attention to summarizing experience in this area and promoting it in a planned and step-by-step manner. Saving cotton must be regarded as a regular and important task of enterprise management, and enterprise management must be gradually improved to improve the management level of textile enterprises.

    节约用棉是纺织业的重要任务
    马中艳
    节约用棉，提高原棉的利用率，是棉纺织企业中一项经常的、重要的任务。特别在目前原棉生产的增长赶不上纺织工业发展需要的情况下，大力节约用棉就更有必要了。
    解放以来，全国棉花产量虽然逐年都有很大增长，但仍赶不上纺织工业发展的需要。如一九五三年全国棉花总产量较一九四九年增加了百分之一百六十五，而全国棉布销售量若以一九五○年为一百，一九五三年已达到三百四十三。为解决生产赶不上消费需要的矛盾，国家已采取了棉布计划收购和计划供应的措施。但要进一步解决这一矛盾，除了要求农民提高棉田的单位面积产量，加强田间管理，保证棉花品质，并适当扩大棉田外，在现有的棉纺织企业和有关的其他国民经济部门中，积极地提倡节约用棉，就成为一项非常重要的任务。节约用棉不仅是解决纺织工业中当前原棉供应赶不上生产发展需要的有效方法，而且能促成棉纺织产品成本的不断降低，推动棉纺织厂企业管理工作的改进，为今后长期地贯彻节约制度打下良好的基础。
      近几年来，全国各国营棉纺织厂在节约用棉方面已取得了相当的成绩。今年第二季度全国各国营棉纺织厂平均每件纱用棉一百九十六点九八公斤，较第一季减少了零点零六公斤，若把今年上半年全国各棉纺织厂平均单位用棉量和去年比较，节约的原棉约可纺一千七百八十多件纱，可织六万多匹布。几年来，各棉纺织厂在实行节约用棉的过程中，在用棉管理上与技术措施上也已积累了不少经验。
    但是，今天节约用棉的工作并不是都做得很好了，有不少工厂浪费原棉的现象还很严重，节约原棉的潜力还很大。同一地区，同一纱支，同一时期，企业与企业之间的用棉量相差还很大，有的竟差十公斤以上。西南纺织管理局上半年用棉大大超过了定额的标准，每件纱用棉量一般高达二百公斤以上。上海国棉八厂、十三厂等今年第一季度超过原订计划用棉量的百分之一点五左右，平均每件纱用棉量达到二百零五公斤左右。西北区棉纺织厂浪费原棉的现象也很严重，如随便乱丢白花，用好花擦机器等。
    有不少企业的干部对节约用棉的政治和经济意义至今仍认识不足，因而虽有节约用棉的技术经济指标，但却缺乏具体措施和严格的检查制度。有些企业对推行作业计划与改进技术领导的关系认识尚不明确，因而还不能把推行作业计划和节约用棉、提高质量等工作很好结合起来。
    有一些领导干部和工程技术人员，把节约用棉和保证质量对立起来，不了解要达到节约用棉的目的，必须加强生产管理和技术领导，因而不去从改进生产管理和改进技术方面多想办法，只片面地认为要节约用棉，就一定会使质量下降。这种错误的看法，影响了节约用棉工作的贯彻。
    节约用棉在技术上的关键是加强棉纺织厂清花、梳棉两个车间的技术领导。这两个车间的落棉率约占总落棉量的百分之八十，而由于目前清棉机气流调节和梳棉机的隔距状态不良，不少厂存在着落棉量高，落棉中含杂率低，含有效纤维多的现象，因此，目前必须在气流与隔距两方面多下工夫。在清棉车间加强原棉管理，实行原棉逐包分级检验，按原棉产地以及含杂情况进行分类排队，逐批调换混棉成分，使混棉成分尽可能长期稳定。在进行这一系列工作时，除必须有系统地对一些问题进行专门研究和加强技术措施外，还必须逐步建立清花、梳棉车间技术管理的各项制度，以达到合理地使用原棉，充分发挥机械性能，提高除杂效率，保证半制品质量的目的。此外控制清花间的相对湿度，保持原棉的一定含水，靠梳棉间的墙上添开气流门，设置烘棉间，严格管理清花间门窗启闭等，对提高除杂效率有直接影响。如果清花间除杂效率能达到百分之七十五以上，梳棉机除杂效率达到百分之八十以上，就会给后部工序创造有利条件。为使落棉回用不影响产品质量，落棉在回用前必须很好加以处理。各地已普遍推行的纤维杂质分离机，经使用证明，处理落棉比较有效，今后在使用中还可继续加以改进。
    除加强清花、梳棉车间的技术领导以外，还应注意做好清花、梳棉以后工序的工作，要设法减少飞花、回花、回丝，大力做好清洁工作，减少纤维损失；要注意加强保全保养工作，在机械运转状态正常的基础上发挥技术措施应有的效果。
    节约用棉在生产管理上应注意的是：要掌握和提高各工序的制成率，健全原始纪录和收付制度，加强盘存，准确地计算用棉量，在注意提高制成率的同时，必须控制下脚率、亏耗率和回花率，要逐月分析研究制成率升降趋势，发现那一种落棉或回花存在着浪费现象，即应进行研究，制订具体办法和确定控制数字，加以贯彻。
    在节约用棉的时候，必须加强技术领导，把提高质量和节约用棉在技术上统一起来。只注意提高质量不注意节约原棉是错误的。但只强调节约用棉不设法保证质量也是错误的。如南通大生一厂错误地把回用落棉作为节约用棉的唯一办法，因而没有抓住合理提高制成率为中心，全面地进行技术领导，安排技术措施。在管理和工人的操作方面也都逐渐陷于自流，结果使落棉回花逐月增加，制成率却逐月下降，形成严重的“大落大回”现象。在对技术人员和工人群众的教育和发动上，也偏重于尽量回用落棉，并错误地发动群众去开展收集飞花的竞赛，如梳棉车间的工人因热中于收集飞花，竟对因断头不接、接头不良而产生的大量回花回条漫不在乎，细纱工人们也只是把注意力集中在停台上去收集飞花，放松了正常的巡回规律和操作上的改进，有些工人见了断头也不接，甚至把尚未用完的粗纱就拗下来作为回花，因而钢丝回花达百分之三，粗纱头也达到百分之零点八，超过一般工厂的标准很多。由于这样“大落大回”的结果，从表面上看，用棉量的数字是降低了，但各种纱支的品质都有下降趋势，这就违反了“必须在认真提高质量的基础上大量节约用棉”的方针。
    有些棉纺织厂的职工对节约原棉还有一些不正确的认识。有的认为：“羊圈里还能没有羊毛，棉纺织厂浪费点原棉是不可避免的。”有的认为节约用棉是找麻烦，“星星点点的节约解决不了什么问题”。这些思想如果不纠正过来，节约原棉的措施就很难贯彻。为贯彻节约用棉，各棉纺织厂必须抓紧对职工进行节约用棉的教育，使全体职工都懂得节约用棉的经济价值和政治意义。必须使他们认识：节约原棉的工作是经常的任务，一丝一缕积累起来，就会积少成多。陕西第二棉纺织厂，有的车间每件纱节约一钱，有的车间节约几两，第二季中就节约了二万多斤原棉。这些棉花能纺五十一件纱，织一千八百多匹布，可供一万三千二百多人各做一套新衣。如果全国各国营棉纺织厂都照他们这样做，就能为国家多生产很多纱布。此外，有关原棉管理的机构，对节约用棉更有直接影响，如仓储运输部门注意减少运途散失，仓存原棉注意防霉去湿，开窗换气，减少仓库下脚等，也是非常重要的。上海市最近举办的纺织技术革新展览会中，突出地展览了节约用棉的部分，提出了“从各方面加强工作，为节约用棉而努力”的口号。
    过去节约用棉虽有不少成绩和不少经验，但是这些经验还没有很好地加以总结和交流推广，用来改进工作，今后各纺织企业必须注意总结这方面的经验，并有计划有步骤地加以推广。必须把节约用棉当做企业管理经常的重要工作，逐步改进企业管理，提高纺织企业的管理水平。
