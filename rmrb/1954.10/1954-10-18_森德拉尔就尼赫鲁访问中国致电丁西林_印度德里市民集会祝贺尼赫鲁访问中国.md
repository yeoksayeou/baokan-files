    Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: Sundarlal, Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association, sent a telegram to Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, on the 15th. The telegram said:
    The Delhi citizens' assembly held on the 14th congratulates Prime Minister Nehru's decision to visit the People's Republic of China, and at the same time wishes the Indian Prime Minister a pleasant journey and a happy return home. The conference is confident that this important visit will further strengthen the ties of friendship between India and China; will enable the People's Republic of China to obtain its due status in the various institutions and conferences of the United Nations, and the day of recovering Taiwan will come soon; will help the people of Asia, Africa and the world to achieve freedom, and will further guarantee the foundation of world peace. The conference also extends the warmest respect and goodwill of the Indian people to the people of the People's Republic of China.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 16th: The Delhi branch of the India-China Friendship Association held a mass rally at the Constitution Club Hall in New Delhi on the 14th to celebrate Prime Minister Nehru's visit to the People's Republic of China. The conference was chaired by Sundarlal, Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association.
    A resolution was passed at the meeting stating: This gathering of Delhi citizens expresses its confidence that Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China, a significant step, will strengthen the friendship between India and China. The resolution extends the warmest respect and blessings of the Indian people to the People's Republic of China. The resolution also emphasized that the time has come for all countries in the world to recognize the People's Republic of China's right to Taiwan. Taiwan should become a part of the People's Republic of China, which is very important for maintaining world peace.
    Rada Raman, Chairman of the Delhi Branch of the India-China Friendship Association and Member of the Indian Parliament, spoke at the meeting in support of the demand for recognition of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations. He said that it is absolutely unjust and unimaginable that China, with a population of 600 million, has no representation in the United Nations and is therefore deprived of its rights. Speaking of Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China, Raman said: Everyone in India is happy about this visit. He believes that this visit will further strengthen the ties between the two countries, the close friendship and goodwill, which were already established during Prime Minister Zhou Enlai's visit to India a few months ago.
    Sundarlal said in his speech that everyone in India today shares the same feelings as the resolution passed by this conference, and hopes that India and China will become closer. He said that Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China will strengthen the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    Sundarlal condemned the imperialist countries for using Taiwan as a war base to threaten aggression against the Chinese people. He said: "We cannot tolerate any foreign ships or planes appearing on the Chinese seas. The US Seventh Fleet must withdraw from Taiwan immediately, and China's legitimate right to Taiwan must be recognized."

    印度德里市民集会祝贺尼赫鲁访问中国
    【新华社十七日讯】印中友好协会主席森德拉尔十五日致电中印友好协会会长丁西林，电文说：
    十四日举行的德里市民大会祝贺尼赫鲁总理决定访问中华人民共和国，同时祝印度总理旅途愉快并愉快地返国。大会满怀信心地希望，这一重要的访问将进一步加强印中两国之间友谊的联系；将使中华人民共和国在联合国组织的各种机构会议中取得应有的地位和收复台湾的日子早日到来；将有助于亚洲、非洲以及世界各国人民获致自由，并将进一步保障世界和平的基础。大会并为印度人民向中华人民共和国的人民致以最热烈的敬意和善意。
    【新华社新德里十六日电】印中友好协会德里分会十四日在新德里宪法俱乐部大厅举行群众大会，庆贺尼赫鲁总理访问中华人民共和国。大会由印中友好协会主席森德拉尔担任主席。
    会上通过决议说：德里市民的这次集会充满信心地期望尼赫鲁总理访问中国这一意义重大的步骤将加强印中两国的友谊。决议向中华人民共和国致以印度人民最热烈的敬意和祝福。决议并着重指出：世界各国承认中华人民共和国对台湾的权利的时候已经来到。台湾应该成为中华人民共和国的一部分，这对于维持世界和平是非常重要的。
    印中友好协会德里分会主席、印度国会议员拉达·拉曼在会上发言，支持承认中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位的要求。他说，拥有六亿人口的中国竟然在联合国中没有代表，并因此被剥夺了它的权利，这是绝对不公正的和不能想像的。拉曼在谈到尼赫鲁总理访问中国时说：在印度，人人都对这次访问感到高兴。他相信这次访问将使周恩来总理在数月前访问印度时已经建立的两国间的联系、两国间密切的友谊和善意，获得进一步加强。
    森德拉尔发言说：今天印度的每一个人都对这次大会所通过的决议具有同感，并希望印度和中国将更加亲密。他说，尼赫鲁总理的访问中国将加强亚洲和世界的和平事业。
    森德拉尔谴责帝国主义国家利用台湾作为战争基地，对中国人民进行侵略的威胁。他说：“我们不能容忍任何外国舰只或飞机出现于中国海面上。美国第七舰队必须立即撤离台湾，中国对台湾的合法权利必须予以承认。”
