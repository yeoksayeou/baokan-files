Flood victims in some areas of Hubei Province that were relocated to non-disaster areas, with the help of Party committees and People's Governments at all levels, have begun to return home in batches to restore production and rebuild their homes. Cadres in various places, with a spirit of being responsible for the disaster victims to the end, have made full preparations when carrying out this work. In the disaster areas and the non-disaster areas where the disaster victims were settled, special organizations have been established to be responsible for the specific work of the disaster victims' return home. The third district of Yunmeng County has established disaster victim repatriation committees at the district and township levels, formulated specific plans for disaster victim repatriation, and educated the disaster victims to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and abide by discipline during the journey. In addition to preparing to set up ten supply points and reception stations along the way for disaster victims to return home, Jianli County is also actively preparing materials for building houses to help disaster victims solve housing difficulties after returning home.

In the non-disaster areas where the disaster victims were settled, the People's Government and the masses also tried their best to help and send off the disaster victims back to their homes. In order to solve the difficulties of eating and drinking tea for the disaster victims returning home, the Tongcheng County People's Government set up four grain supply points along the way, a tea station every five miles, a medical station every ten miles, and reception stations at appropriate locations. In addition to organizing water and land transportation and preparing grain and grass supplies to send off disaster victims back to their hometowns, Tianmen County also mobilized the masses along the way to repair roads in dangerous places to ensure the safety of disaster victims on their way home. The masses in Bozhen Township, the fifth district of Xianning County, prepared a portion of dry food in advance and distributed it to the disaster victims for consumption along the way. Thirty-eight young and middle-aged farmers in the township also helped disaster victims move their luggage and carry the elderly. Now 90% of the disaster victims settled in Xianning County have returned home.

The disaster victims are very grateful to the Party and the state for rescuing them with ships and trains in times of crisis, and now they are responsible for organizing them to return home after the water recedes. They are also very moved by the spirit of mutual assistance and love of the masses in the non-disaster areas. They have expressed that they will repay the care of the country and the masses in the non-disaster areas with practical actions to restore production as soon as possible and strive for a bumper harvest next year.

Now, the disaster victims who have returned home are actively draining waterlogged areas and actively preparing for winter ploughing and sowing. (Our reporter station in Hubei)

    湖北省重灾区灾民开始回乡恢复生产
    湖北省重灾区转移到非灾区的部分灾民，在各级党委和人民政府帮助下，已开始分批还家，恢复生产，重建家园。各地干部在进行这一工作时，都以对灾民负责到底的精神，进行了充分的准备工作。在灾区和安置灾民的非灾区，都建立了专门机构，负责进行灾民返乡的各项具体工作。云梦县第三区区、乡都成立了灾民返乡委员会，定制了灾民返乡的具体计划，并教育灾民在途中要发扬互助精神和遵守纪律。监利县除了准备在灾民还乡途中设立十个供应处和接待站迎接灾民返乡外，还积极准备盖屋的材料，帮助灾民返乡后解决住房的困难。
    在安置灾民的非灾区，人民政府和群众对返乡的灾民也尽力帮助和欢送灾民还乡。通城县人民政府为了解决灾民还乡途中吃饭、喝茶等困难，在沿途设立了四个粮食供应点，每五里路设一个茶水站，每十里路设立一个医疗站，并在适当地点设立招待站。天门县除了组织水、陆交通工具，准备粮、草供应欢送灾民返乡外，还发动沿途群众在险要地方修补道路，保证灾民在返乡途中的安全。咸宁县第五区伯镇乡的群众事先准备了一部分干粮，分送灾民沿途食用。该乡还有三十八个青、壮年农民，帮助灾民搬运行李与抬送老年人。现在在咸宁县安置的灾民已有百分之九十返乡。
    灾民对于党和国家在危急情况下，用轮船、火车把他们抢救出来，现在水退了又负责组织他们回乡，非常感激。他们对于非灾区群众互助友爱的精神也很感动，他们纷纷表示，回家后要用及早恢复生产，争取明年丰收的实际行动，来报答国家和非灾区群众的关怀。
    现在，已返家的灾民，正在积极排除渍水，积极准备冬耕播种。（本报湖北记者站）
