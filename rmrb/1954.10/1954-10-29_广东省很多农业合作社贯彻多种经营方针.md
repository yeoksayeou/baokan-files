Many agricultural production cooperatives in Guangdong Province are actively implementing a diversified economy policy that combines agriculture, forestry, fishing, and animal husbandry, and have achieved significant results. The Bianhai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yangjiang County, which is located by the sea, has now excavated a fishing port with an area of 350 mu, and it is estimated that its annual income will reach 30 million yuan. The Xintian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinan Township, Nanhai County, has blocked a stagnant water surge with a water surface of 12 mu, which can not only be used to grow lotus roots and other crops, but also to plant bananas on the surrounding dikes, which can generate an income of 50 to 60 million yuan a year. Many agricultural production cooperatives also organize handicraft production such as grain processing, making tofu, and making bamboo products, as well as sideline production such as raising ducks, geese, and fish, according to local characteristics. The sideline income of the Shahu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingyuan County, such as raising pigs, will reach 10 million yuan this year. In addition to using it to increase the income of its members, they also plan to use part of the funds to install two ox-drawn waterwheels to expand agricultural reproduction.

    广东省很多农业合作社贯彻多种经营方针
    广东省各地农业生产合作社积极贯彻农、林、渔、牧相结合的多种经营方针，并获得显著成绩。靠海的阳江县边海农业生产合作社现已开挖了一个面积三百五十亩的渔港，预计每年收入可达三千万元；南海县夏南乡新田地农业生产合作社，堵塞了一条十二亩水面的死水涌，不仅可以种植莲藕等作物，而四周堤围上还可种植香蕉，一年即可收入五、六千万元。许多农业生产合作社并根据当地的特点，组织粮食加工、磨豆腐、制竹器等手工业生产和养鸭、鹅、鱼等副业生产。清远县沙湖农业生产合作社今年养猪等副业收入，即可达一千万元，他们除用以增加社员收入外，还准备以部分资金安装二架牛拉水车，扩大了农业再生产。
