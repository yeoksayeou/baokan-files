    Party Work on the Construction Site
    ——Ninth Visit to Ukraine
    By Our Correspondent　Li He
    During my visit to various parts of Ukraine in July, I heard people talking about three things the most, and saw what excited them most. The first was the construction of the world's first atomic power station by the Soviet Union. The second was that the population of the People's Republic of China had reached 600 million. The third was the achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other peace-loving forces at the Geneva Conference.

    At the construction site of New Kakhovka, when we spoke with the workers and engineers who were diligently engaged in peaceful construction, we inevitably touched upon the cause of peace. Vasily Vasilyevich Gonykh, chief engineer of the Overflow Dam Construction and Installation Bureau, said: "Zhou Enlai's visit to India is of great significance for peace in Asia and the world. Just the Chinese people plus the Indian people make one billion, accounting for half of humanity." Ivan Fedoseyevich Grushenko (non-Party member), captain of the concrete team, said:
    "Only a small handful of big capitalists in the United States want to create war. But it is not easy for them to provoke war. The people in the peace camp are not sleeping. We are building hydroelectric power stations, and also building atomic power stations."

    The Soviet people, who are resolutely fighting for world peace, naturally care most about those factors that are conducive to world peace. The correct political understanding and vigorous labor enthusiasm of the builders of New Kakhovka are closely related to the work of the Party organization and political work. Therefore, let us briefly understand the Party's work on the construction site.

    Party members account for one-twelfth of the employees in the Kakhovka Hydropower Station construction project. There are many party members. A Party Committee was established in accordance with the Party Constitution. The Party Committee leads the overall Party work on the construction site and supervises production. We met with Grigory Ivanovich Shchepilkin, the representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on this project. He is also the secretary of the Party Committee. We know that every large industrial enterprise and construction project in the Soviet Union has a representative of the Party Central Committee who is also the secretary of the Party Committee. What is his special task? Shchepilkin said: The representative of the Party Central Committee is approved by the Party Central Committee and has greater responsibilities than the general secretary of the Party Committee. In addition to doing the work of the secretary of the Party Committee, he also has the responsibility to regularly report the progress of the construction to the Party Central Committee and to raise major issues that need to be resolved, such as the workers are working too fast, the design cannot keep up with the construction, and the need to strengthen the design force. He reports his work to the Party Central Committee several times a year and makes a summary report to the Party Central Committee once a year.

    The Party Committee consists of the following nine members: the secretary (representative of the Party Central Committee), the deputy secretary, the director of the Construction Bureau, the chairman of the Trade Union Committee, the secretary of the Communist Youth League, the editor of the construction site newspaper, the director of the Party Committee library, the captain of the concrete team, and the secretary of the Party Branch of the Power Management Office. According to Comrade Shchepilkin, the work of the Party Committee is to drive the Party, trade union, youth league organizations and other mass organizations to strive towards the unified goal of completing the decisions of the Party and the government. The Party Committee actively supports all advanced experiences. The concrete team led by Nikulin, a total of twenty-three people, has been completing 250 percent of the plan for two years with good quality. This is because the Party group pays attention to educating the workers, specifically helping those who are not skilled in their work, and severely criticizing those who do not work hard. The Party Branch promoted their experience. The entire project has saved 20 million rubles this year by adopting various new working methods.

    The Party Committee pays special attention to carrying out socialist emulation among construction workers. Now, competitions are being held enthusiastically between teams, sections, construction offices, and construction bureaus, and between the construction bureau and the Angara Hydropower Station construction bureau. The team competition is summarized weekly, and the section and construction office competitions are summarized monthly. There are four kinds of mobile red flags awarded to the winners of the competition. The best construction office is awarded the red flag of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine and the Council of Ministers of Ukraine. The best section is awarded the winning red flag of the Kherson Oblast (New Kakhovka is in Kherson Oblast) Party Committee and Soviet Executive Committee. The best production team is awarded the winning red flag of the Kakhovka City Party Committee and the City Soviet Executive Committee. The best auxiliary enterprise is awarded the winning red flag of the Party, Administration and Trade Union of the Construction Bureau. Employees who have been excellent throughout the year are listed on the Roll of Honor. We saw that the photos and deeds of these outstanding workers had become a thick book.

    The Party Committee works according to plan. It makes a plan every three months. It holds a meeting every two weeks to solve important issues in production, Party affairs, and the material and cultural life of workers. When necessary, the meeting also absorbs relevant activists (such as branch secretaries, party group leaders, and party members among technical personnel) to participate. For example, the Party Committee recently discussed the preparation for construction work under winter conditions, and the director of the Construction Bureau made a report. The deputy director, the directors of the Sluice Construction and Installation Office, the Overflow Dam Construction and Installation Office, the Automobile Office, and the Mechanical Office participated. The Party Committee also recently discussed the preparation of the Party's education network for the 1954-55 academic year and the work of the Communist Youth League.

    The Construction Bureau Party Committee is directly led by the Kakhovka City Party Committee. The first or second secretary of the City Party Committee or the director of the Industrial Department (usually the first secretary) attends every meeting of the Construction Bureau Party Committee. The City Party Committee often listens to reports on the work of the Party organization and administration on the construction site at its meetings.

    The working organization of the Party Committee is very lean. There are no sections under it, only one instructor responsible for organizational work and one director of the library (and two full-time reporters) responsible for propaganda work. In addition, there is also a typist.

    The instructor, Fedor Nikolaevich Pogorelov, is an old soldier of Budyonny's cavalry division during the Soviet domestic war, who participated in the battle to liberate Kakhovka at that time, and has been a party member for thirty years. He said: The instructor reads the minutes of the meetings of the various branches, studies the situation of the various grassroots organizations, provides opinions to the Party Committee, and does work such as transferring Party relations and collecting Party dues.

    The director of the Party Committee Library, Yekaterina Timofeyevna Maksimova, looks no more than thirty years old and is a capable propaganda worker. She talked in detail about the propaganda work on the construction site. The task of the director of the library and the two full-time reporters is to realize the Party Committee's leadership over the mass and political work on the construction site. The working methods are diverse. There are lecture groups, propaganda teams, study networks, as well as wall newspapers, satirical cartoon newspapers, quick reports, slogans, etc. She and the two full-time reporters are each responsible for leading the propaganda work of several branches. They regularly participate in the branch committees to understand the progress of mass and political work and provide specific assistance. They regularly organize seminars for propagandists to exchange experiences. They also regularly go to the production teams to talk with the workers, understand the workers' demands in terms of material and cultural life, and reflect them to the Party Committee.

    The lecture group has thirty people, and the lecturers are engineers and administrative workers. Each construction office holds at least two lectures per month, sometimes as many as eight. The content of the lectures ranges from international issues to scientific knowledge. In order to ensure that the lectures are good, the staff of the Party Committee Library first reviews the lecture manuscripts, puts forward suggestions for revision, and then issues lecture certificates. For lecture manuscripts on technical issues, the staff of the Party Committee Library also finds expert technical experts to review and make comments. Directors of various construction offices can only submit outlines in advance when talking about engineering issues. People from Moscow and Kyiv often come to give lectures. For example, the Science and Technology Propaganda Committee affiliated to the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Ukraine gave three lectures at the open-air theater in New Kakhovka in July: a doctor of technical sciences spoke on "The Achievements of Soviet Scientists in Mechanics"; a scientific researcher spoke on "The World People Fighting for Peace"; a Master of Medicine spoke on "The Causes of Cancer."

    The political work on the construction site is mainly carried out by propaganda teams (agitation teams). The propaganda team carries out its work under the leadership of the secretary of the Party Branch in accordance with the guidelines instructed by the Party Committee. The branch secretary convenes a meeting of all the propagandists in the team once a week to exchange experiences and decide on the tasks for the week. Each construction office has a propaganda team. There are twenty-two propaganda teams on the entire construction site. Each team has twenty to forty or even sixty propagandists. There are a total of more than 700 propagandists. Most of them are Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and non-Party members with high political levels. Each propagandist works with three, four, or even ten or twenty workers. The propagandist talks to the workers two or three times a week, sometimes every day, with the aim of increasing the workers' political and labor enthusiasm and enabling the workers to adopt a critical and progressive attitude towards their work. The propagandist's conversation is based on the important materials of the central and local newspapers and is linked to the current work. In order to make the conversation interesting. The propagandist not only reads the newspaper, he sometimes starts from criticizing the shortcomings in the work, then takes out the newspaper, puts forward advanced examples from Moscow and other places, sometimes adopts a question-and-answer format, and sometimes uses vivid sentences to narrate and explain things in the newspaper.

    The Party Committee Library leads the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism by Party members. The construction site has a full set of study networks, from the Water Conservancy Technical College night school, the Water Conservancy Secondary Technical Night School, the Young Workers Night School, to short-term technical training courses. Many workers are studying without leaving their production posts. For example, there is a family named Protsenko with five fathers and sons who came to the construction site from the countryside and work in the same team. One son is already in the second year of the night school, and the rest of the sons are studying in the secondary night school. There are many female workers on the construction site. Some production teams are all female workers. Many female workers have learned techniques such as electric welding without leaving their production posts. The study of political theory, which runs parallel with cultural and technical studies, is compulsory for Party members. The academic year for political theory education begins on October 1. The library draws up a one-year study plan. The library does not formulate a study plan based on subjective wishes, regardless of the specific conditions of the Party members, and rigidly include them, but first carefully investigates the level and requirements of each Party member, and then draws up an appropriate plan. There are study groups for the full text of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, study groups for the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with reference to classic works, self-study groups, etc. For example, among the Party members in the Mechanical Office, 12 people are studying the full text of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the first year, 13 people are studying the full text of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the second year, 19 people are studying the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the first year with reference to classic works (the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is scheduled to be completed in two years), 5 people are self-studying classic works, 5 people are attending lectures on political common sense, 2 people are attending night Party schools, and 8 people are participating in reporter (propagandist) seminars. Party members from the entire construction site are organized into eighty-six study groups. Each group is led by a reporter. The library helps the reporters choose materials and holds a reporter seminar once a month. At the seminar, experts are invited to answer various questions, including international current affairs issues. The library systematically organizes lectures on Party history, political economy, and philosophy every month. The library has 8,000 books, including the original works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and various books on political economy and philosophy, for Party members to read.

    The construction site publishes a lead-printed newspaper, "The People's Construction Project," which is half the size of our country's "People's Daily." It is the organ of the Party Committee, the Construction Bureau, and the Trade Union. It is an important weapon for the Party Committee to carry out mass political and ideological work. It is published three times a week, with a circulation of more than 2,000 copies. We went to the newspaper's editorial office and printing plant. The editorial office has an editor, a deputy editor who is also in charge of the Party life department, three writers, and a clerk. The newspaper reports on the progress of the project and the life of the workers, exposes and criticizes shortcomings in the work, supports and introduces advanced figures and advanced experiences, and guides the wall newspapers in various parts of the construction site. The materials mainly rely on worker correspondents. The newspaper has one hundred worker correspondents. They are all advanced elements in production.

    The organizational work and mass political work led by the Party Committee rely on the Party's grassroots organizations to carry out. Party branches have been established in the various offices of the Construction Bureau. There are twenty-eight party branches in the bureau. We visited Ivan Alekseevich Dmitriev, the secretary of the Party Branch of the Overflow Dam Construction and Installation Office, and Setifim Nikitovich Nikulin, the leader of the Party Group of the Second Section of this office. Dmitriev is also a member of the Municipal Party Committee. Nikulin is also a member of the Construction Bureau Party Committee and a member of the Party Branch of this office. This construction office has seventy party members, accounting for about one-twentieth of the employees. The Party Branch Congress is held once a month, and the Branch Committee (five members) holds two meetings each month. Four of the five sections in this office have Party Groups. The Party Group of the Second Section has eleven party members. Group meetings are convened when necessary to conduct discussions and criticisms, but resolutions cannot be made.

    The Party Branch first requires Party members to play an exemplary role in their work. Many party members in this branch have overfulfilled their plans by one or two times. Party member Mitrofanov is a concrete worker who often completes twice the work and has good quality work and is willing to help others. As long as he is present, the completion of the work plan is guaranteed. A feature of the branch's work is to pay attention to assigning specific tasks to each Party member. Some Party members do trade union or Communist Youth League work, some are wall newspaper editors, some are propagandists, and some accept temporary entrustments from the Party organization to conduct ideological education on labor discipline for some workers. Every Party member has social work. The Party group leader regularly checks the situation of Party members completing the tasks entrusted by the Party organization. In this way, each Party member can give full play to his abilities.

    Active Party work is a decisive guarantee that the Kakhovka Hydropower Station construction project will be completed ahead of schedule.

    工地党的工作
    ——乌克兰访问记之九
    本报记者　李何
    七月间，在乌克兰各地访问的时候，听到人们谈论最多的，看到最使他们兴奋的有三件事。第一件事，是苏联建设了世界上第一个原子能发电站。第二件事，是中华人民共和国人口达到了六万万。第三件事，是苏联、中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国和其他爱好和平的力量在日内瓦会议上的成就。
    在新卡霍夫卡的工地上，我们同辛苦地进行着和平建设的工人和工程师谈话时，不免也接触到和平事业。溢水堤建筑和安装处主任工程师瓦西里·瓦西里维奇·高尼赫说：“周恩来访问印度，对于亚洲和世界和平有重大意义。仅仅中国人民加印度人民，就是十万万，占人类的一半。”混凝土队队长伊凡·费多薛也维奇·格鲁先科（非党员）说：
  “想制造战争的只是美国一小撮大资本家。但他们要挑起战争并不是容易的。和平阵营的人们并没有睡觉。我们建设着水力发电站，也建设着原子能发电站。”
    坚决为世界和平而斗争的苏联人民，自然最关心那些对世界和平有利的因素。新卡霍夫卡建筑者的正确的政治认识和旺盛的劳动情绪，与党的组织和政治工作不能没有密切的关系。因此我们粗略地了解一下工地党的工作。
    卡霍夫卡水电站建筑工程中党员占职工数目的十二分之一。党员很多。按照党章建立了党委员会。党委员会领导着工地全盘党的工作，对生产进行着监督。我们会见了苏联共产党中央委员会在这个工程上的代表格里哥里·伊凡诺维奇·薛比尔金。他同时是党委员会的书记。我们知道，苏联各个大的工业企业和建筑工程，都有同时是党委员会书记的党中央代表。他有什么特别任务呢？薛比尔金说：党中央代表由党中央批准，比一般的党委员会书记的责任更大一些。除了做党委员会书记的工作以外，他还有责任经常向党中央报告建筑进展的情况，并且提出待解决的重大问题，如像工人工作做得快了，设计赶不上施工，要求加强设计力量之类的问题。他每年几次向党中央报告工作，每年一次向党中央作总结报告。
    党委员会由如下九个委员组成：书记（党中央代表）、副书记、建筑局局长、工会委员会主席、青年团书记、工地报纸编辑、党委图书室主任、混凝土队队长、电力管理处党支部书记。党委员会的工作，据薛比尔金同志说，是带动党、工会、青年团的组织及其他群众组织朝着完成党和政府的决定的统一目标努力。党委员会积极支持一切先进的经验。尼古林所领导的混凝土队，一共二十三人，全队两年中一直完成着百分之二百五十的计划，而且质量很好。这是因为党小组注意教育工人们，具体帮助工作不熟练的，严厉批评工作不努力的。党支部推广了他们的经验。全工程今年由于采纳各种新的工作方法，已经节约了二千万卢布。
    党委员会特别注意在建筑工人中开展社会主义竞赛。现在工地上队和队、工段和工段、建筑处和建筑处、建筑局和安加拉水电站建筑局之间，都热烈地进行着竞赛。队的竞赛每周总结一次，工段和建筑处的竞赛每月总结一次。有四种流动红旗授给竞赛的优胜者。给最好的建筑处以乌克兰共产党中央委员会和乌克兰部长会议的红旗。给最好的工段以赫尔逊州（新卡霍夫卡在赫尔逊州）党委员会和苏维埃执行委员会的优胜红旗。给最好的生产队以卡霍夫卡市党委员会和市苏维埃执行委员会的优胜红旗。给最好的辅助企业以建筑局的党、行政和工会的优胜红旗。整整一年工作都是优秀的职工，登上光荣簿。我们看到这些优秀工作者的照片和事绩已经成一厚册。
    党委员会有计划地进行工作。它三个月订一次计划。它每两星期举行一次会议，解决生产、党务以及工人的物质与文化生活上的重要问题。必要时，会议也吸收有关的积极分子（如支部书记、党小组长、技术人员的党员）参加。例如：党委员会最近讨论了在冬季条件下进行建筑工作的准备，由建筑局局长作报告。吸收了副局长、水闸建筑安装处、溢水堤建筑安装处、汽车处、机械处等处主任参加。党委员会最近也讨论了一九五四—五五年学年党的教育网的编制，青年团的工作。
    建筑局党委员会受卡霍夫卡市党委员会的直接领导。市党委员会的第一或第二书记或工业部主任
  （经常是第一书记），出席建筑局党委员会的每次会议。市党委员会会议时常听取工地党组织和行政的工作报告。
      党委员会的工作机构很精干。它的下面不设科，只有一个指导员负责着组织工作，一个图书室主任（和两个专职的报告员）负责着宣传工作。此外，还有一个打字的文书。
    指导员费德尔·尼古拉维奇·波哥列洛夫，是苏联国内战争时期布琼尼骑兵师的老战士，曾经参加当时解放卡霍夫卡的战斗，已经有三十年党龄。他说：指导员阅读各支部的会议记录，研究各个基层组织的情况，向党委员会提供意见，并且做转党的关系，收党费等工作。
    党委图书室主任叶卡杰林娜·捷马费也夫娜·马克辛莫娃看样子不过三十岁，是一个能干的宣传工作者。她详细谈了工地的宣传工作。图书室主任和两个专职报告员的任务，是实现党委员会对工地群众和政治工作的领导。工作的方式是多样的。有讲演组、宣传队、学习网以及墙报、讽刺画报、快报、标语等。她和两个专职的报告员分工各负责领导几个支部的宣传工作。他们经常参加各支部委员会，了解群众和政治工作进行的情形，给予具体的帮助。他们经常组织宣传员研究会，交流经验。他们也经常到生产队中去，与工人们谈话，了解工人们对于物质和文化生活方面的要求，反映给党委员会。
    讲演组三十个人，讲演员由工程师和行政工作者担任。每月每个建筑处至少举行两次讲演会，有时多至八次。从国际问题到科学知识，都是讲演会的内容。为了保证讲演会开得好，党委员会图书室工作人员事先审阅了讲演稿，提出修正的意见，然后发给讲演证。关于技术问题的讲演稿，党委员会图书室工作人员也找内行的技术专家审阅和提意见。各建筑处主任等讲工程上的问题，事先可以只交提纲。莫斯科和基辅常常有人来作讲演。例如，乌克兰共和国科学院所属的科学技术宣传委员会七月份在新卡霍夫卡的露天戏院作了三个讲演：一位技术科学博士讲“苏联科学家在机械方面的成就”；一位科学研究员讲“为和平而斗争的世界人民”；一位医学硕士讲“癌病的原因”。
    工地上的政治工作，主要是由宣传队（鼓动队）进行的。宣传队在党支部书记的领导之下按照党委员会所指示的方针进行工作。支部书记每周召集全队宣传员座谈一次，以交换经验和决定一周内的任务。每个建筑处都有一个宣传队。全工地有二十二个宣传队。每队有二十个到四十个甚至六十个宣传员。总共有七百多个宣传员。大都是政治水平较高的党员、团员和非党团员都有。每个宣传员向三、四个，甚至十个、二十个工人进行工作。宣传员每星期向工人进行两三次谈话，有时天天进行，目的在于提高工人们的政治和劳动的热情，使工人们对自己的工作采取批评和求进步的态度。宣传员的谈话以中央和地方报纸的重要材料为根据，联系当前的工作。为了使谈话有兴趣。宣传员不只是读报，他有时从批评工作中的缺点开始，然后取出报纸，提出莫斯科和其他地方的先进例子，有时采取问答形式，有时用生动的话句来叙述和解释报上的事情。
    党委图书室领导着党员的马克思列宁主义的理论学习。工地有全套学习网，从水利技术学院夜校、水力中等技术夜校、青年工人夜校，到短期技术训练班，都有许多工人不脱离生产地在学习。例如，有一家姓普罗采依的父子五人，从农村来到工地，在一个队工作。有一个儿子已在夜间学院读到二年级，其余的儿子在中等夜校学习。工地上有很多女工。有的生产队全是女工。很多女工不脱离生产地学会了电焊之类技术。和文化技术学习并行的政治理论的学习，党员必须参加。政治理论教育的学年从十月一日开始。图书室订出一年学习计划。图书室不是凭主观愿望拟订一个学习计划，不顾党员的具体条件，刻板地把他们包罗进去，而是先向每个党员仔细地调查程度和要求，然后订出适当的计划。有学习联共党史本文组，学习联共党史并参考经典著作组，自修组等等。例如机械处的党员，有十二人第一年学习联共党史本文，十三人第二年学习联共党史本文，十九人第一年学习联共党史并参考经典著作（联共党史定两年学完），五人自修经典著作，五人听讲政治常识，二人进夜间党校，八人参加报告员（宣传员）研究会。全工地党员被组织在八十六个学习组中。每组由一个报告员领导。图书室帮助报告员选择材料，并且每月举行一次报告员研究会。在研究会上，请专人解答各个问题，包括国际时事问题。图书室每月有计划地组织党史、政治经济学、哲学的讲演。图书室有八千册存书，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的原著和政治经济学、哲学各种书籍都有，供给党员阅读。
    工地出版着有我国“人民日报”一半大的铅印报“全民的建筑工程”。它是党委员会、建筑局和工会的机关报。它是党委员会进行群众政治工作和思想工作的重要武器。每周出版三次，发行二千份以上。我们到了报纸的编辑部和印刷所。编辑部有一个编辑、一个副编辑兼管党生活部、三个文字工作者、一个文书。报纸报道工程进行和工人生活的情况，揭露和批评工作中的缺点，支持和介绍先进人物和先进经验，指导工地各处的墙报。材料主要是依靠工人通讯员。报纸有一百个工人通讯员。他们都是生产上的先进分子。
      党委员会所领导的组织工作和群众政治工作，依靠党各基层组织来进行。建筑局的各个处建立有党支部。全局有二十八个党支部。我们访问了溢水堤建筑安装处党支部书记伊凡·亚历克世也维奇·德米特里也夫，和这个处的第二工段党小组长世提非木·尼基托维奇·尼古林。德米特里也夫同时是党市委员会委员。尼古林同时是建筑局党委员会委员和这个处的党支部委员。这个建筑处有七十个党员，约占职工的二十分之一。党支部大会每月举行一次，支部委员会（五个委员）每月举行两次会议。这个处的五个工段中四个段有党小组。第二段的党小组有十一个党员。小组会议遇必要时就召开，进行讨论和批评，但不能作出决议。
    党支部首先要求党员在工作中起着模范作用。这个支部的党员超额一两倍完成计划的很多。党员米特罗法诺夫是混凝土工人，经常完成双倍工作，而且工作质量好，肯帮助别人。只要有他在场，工作计划的完成就一定有保证。支部工作中的一个特色，是注意分配给每个党员以具体的任务。有的党员做工会或青年团工作，有的当墙报编辑，有的当宣传员，也有接受党组织的临时委托，向某些工人进行劳动纪律的思想教育的。每个党员都有社会工作。党小组长经常检查党员完成党组织的委托的情形。这样每个党员都能发挥他的能力。
    活跃的党的工作，这是卡霍夫卡水电站建筑工程将提前完成的决定性保证。
