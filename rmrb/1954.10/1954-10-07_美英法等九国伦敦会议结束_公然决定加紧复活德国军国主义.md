Xinhua News Agency, London, October 5th: TASS, London, October 5th—The nine-nation conference—United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Canada, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy—discussing the rearmament of West Germany has concluded. The “Final Communique” issued after the meeting said: “The Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the United States declare that it is their policy as rapidly as possible to end the occupation regime in the Federal Republic,” although the conference’s resolutions stipulate that Western countries will indefinitely maintain their troops on West German territory. West Germany and Italy will be invited to join the Brussels military bloc, and West Germany will be invited to join the North Atlantic Alliance. West Germany will obtain the right to possess land, air and naval forces and to arm itself. The London agreement deliberately emphasizes the issue of “supervision” of the armaments of the Brussels Treaty signatory states, as well as the so-called “guarantees” of the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. This “Final Communique” also contains an appeasing declaration from Adenauer, to the effect that Germany supposedly guarantees not to produce certain types of weapons and agrees to supervision of the implementation of the terms of the agreement.

Undoubtedly, in the presence of a narrow and exclusive military bloc, neither the “supervision” nor the “guarantees” mentioned in this agreement can restrain the German militarism that the London Conference is giving the right to free action. It is very clear that the resolutions made at the London Conference are full of the greatest threat of revived German militarism to the security and independence of European countries.
Xinhua News Agency, October 6th: Washington—U.S. officials admitted that the new military bloc, including an armed West Germany, established by the London Nine-Nation Conference agreement, has the same nature as the “European Defense Community,” which finally went bankrupt because it was spurned by the people of Europe.

President Eisenhower said in a statement on the 4th: "The agreements reached at the London Nine-Nation Conference, once ratified, would seem to preserve most of the value of the original European Defense Community proposal."

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, after returning to Washington from London on the 4th, said in a statement at the airport: The London Conference "drafted a system to replace the European Defense Community, which gave European unity a strong core, thus able to maintain and strengthen the Atlantic Group. Therefore, it salvaged many valuable elements of the European Defense Community plan."

Dulles also admitted that, under the guise of "Western European unity," this new military bloc will deprive Western European countries of their sovereignty. He said:
"Western European unity will be developed within the scope of the Brussels Treaty. ... The Council (of the Brussels Treaty Organization) will have extensive powers and will be able to vote on many important issues by a majority vote. In this way, national power gives way to European power."

    美英法等九国伦敦会议结束
    公然决定加紧复活德国军国主义
   【新华社五日讯】塔斯社伦敦五日讯：讨论西德重新武装问题的九国——美国、英国、法国、西德、加拿大、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡和意大利——会议已经结束。会后发表的“最后决议书”说：“法国、联合王国和美国的政府宣称，它们的政策是尽速结束在联邦共和国中的占领政权”，虽然会议的决议书规定，西方国家将无限期地保持它们在西德领土上的驻军。西德和意大利将被邀参加布鲁塞尔军事集团，而且西德将被邀参加北大西洋联盟。西德将获得拥有陆空军和海军的权利和武装自己的权利。伦敦协议故意强调对布鲁塞尔条约各缔约国的军备进行“监督”的问题以及联合王国、美国和加拿大的所谓“保证”。这个“最后决议书”也包含了阿登纳的一个笼络人心的宣言，大意说，据说德国保证不生产某种类型的武器，并且同意对协议的条款的履行进行监督。
    毫无疑问，在存在着一个狭隘的和排他的军事集团的情况下，无论这个协议中所说的“监督”还是“保证”，都不能约束伦敦会议正在给以自由行动的权利的德国军国主义。非常明显，伦敦会议作出的决议充满了复活的德国军国主义对欧洲各国的安全与独立的最大威胁。
   【新华社六日讯】华盛顿消息：美国官方承认，伦敦九国会议协议建立的包括武装起来的西德在内的新的军事集团，和那个因为被欧洲人民唾弃而终于破产了的“欧洲防务集团”有着相同的性质。
    艾森豪威尔总统在四日发表声明说：“伦敦九国会议中达成的协议在一旦批准后，似乎会保存原来的欧洲防务集团建议所有的大部分价值。”
    美国国务卿杜勒斯四日从伦敦回到华盛顿后，在机场发表声明说：伦敦会议“拟订了一个代替欧洲防务集团的体系，这个体系使欧洲统一有一个坚强的核心，因此能够维护、加强大西洋集团。所以，它挽救了欧洲防务集团计划的许多可贵的因素。”
    杜勒斯还承认，在“西欧统一”的幌子下，这个新的军事集团将剥夺西欧国家的主权。他说：
  “西欧统一将在布鲁塞尔条约的范围内求得发展。……（布鲁塞尔条约组织的）理事会将有广泛的权力，并且能够在许多重要问题上以过半数票表决。这样，国家的权力就让位给了欧洲的权力。”
