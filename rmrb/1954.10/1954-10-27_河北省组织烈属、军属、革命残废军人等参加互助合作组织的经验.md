Hebei Province's Experience in Organizing Families of Martyrs, Military Dependents, and Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers to Participate in Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations
Liu Dengzhong

With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, Hebei Province has actively organized the families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Currently, throughout the province, the number of families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers who have joined mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives accounts for about 60 percent of their total households. In counties with a relatively good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, such as Tongxian, Shahe, Lincheng, Neiqiu, and Xingtai, this figure reaches 80 percent. In many areas, entire districts, townships, or villages of families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, bringing into play the enthusiasm of semi-able-bodied and female labor forces to participate in production, and closely integrating the work of substitute farming with the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The land of families of martyrs and military dependents without labor is contracted for cultivation and yield by mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives; families of martyrs and military dependents who are able to work participate in mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives, performing work and earning work points on the same basis as other team members or cooperative members, with substitute farming work tickets being handed over to the team to offset work or handed over to the cooperative to offset workdays. The substitute farming work that individual households should bear is resolved through the method of exchanging labor for funds. If the substitute farming funds are lower than the remuneration that should be earned for workdays, the cooperative uses the substitute farming funds to invest in sideline production and then seeks ways to make up the difference; if the work tickets are higher than the remuneration that should be earned for workdays, the substitute farming funds are handed over to the families of martyrs and military dependents in their original amount. This has greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the families of martyrs and military dependents, significantly increased the yield per unit area of their land, and enabled them to gradually move towards the socialist road of organized production for self-sufficiency and common prosperity.

This year, the wheat of thirty-five households of families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in Bazhuang Village, Beizhao Township, Shenze County, Hebei, who joined mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives, averaged 260 jin per mu, an increase of more than 40 jin per mu compared to last year. The Junzikou Village Agricultural, Forestry, Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Zunhua County has absorbed a large number of semi-able-bodied and female labor from families of martyrs and military dependents to participate in production, improving their lives across the board. The total grain output of the thirteen households of families of martyrs and military dependents who had not joined the cooperative the year before last was more than 32,700 jin, which increased to more than 42,600 jin after joining the cooperative last year, an average increase of more than 760 jin per household. With the increase in grain production, all of them voluntarily declined subsidies from the People's Government, and nine households sold more than 4,200 jin of surplus grain to the People's Government.

After joining mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives, the families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, under the training and education of the local Party and government leading organs, have become the backbone force for promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. Among the 262 representatives attending the representative meeting of families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers convened in the Tangshan Special District, 29 were leaders of mutual aid teams and 68 were chairmen of agricultural producers' cooperatives. They enjoy high prestige among the broad masses of peasants and have become model figures in various places for developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Yin Sheng, a family member of a martyr from Shaojiajie Village, Fengrun County, Gao Guizhen, a military dependent from Henan Township, Shunyi County, Qin Yuanzhao, a revolutionary disabled soldier from Xidatun Village, Handan County, and Li Ju, a demobilized construction soldier from Fujiazhuang, Wei County, have all played a significant role in promoting the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Labor models and preferential treatment models among the families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers throughout the province account for more than 25 percent of the total number of labor models in the province.

In order to do a good job in organizing the families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Hebei Provincial People's Government made a report on "Organizing Families of Martyrs, Military Dependents, Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Construction Soldiers to Participate in Mutual Aid and Cooperative Production" at the mutual aid and cooperation meeting convened by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee last winter. The meeting also clearly pointed out the direction of preferential treatment work. After the meeting, the Provincial Party Committee issued instructions on "Strengthening Preferential Treatment Work." The Party committees at all levels in the province have carried out specific organizational work based on these instructions. Tangshan Special District, Xuanhua City, Tongxian County, and more than 40 counties such as Mancheng have convened representative meetings of families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, one after another, to implement the policies and guidelines for developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations, calling on them to "carry forward revolutionary traditions, strive for greater glory," and actively strive to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture.

In organizing families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative production in various parts of Hebei Province, some township and village cadres have purely caring views, believing that their difficulties can be solved by government care, and that they can solve their problems without participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations; some team members and cooperative members lack sufficient understanding of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, dislike their semi-able-bodied and female labor, and are afraid of trouble and hardship. Some families of martyrs and military dependents are not active in production, thinking that their land is being farmed by others, and it is enough to have enough to eat and wear; others are afraid that they will be deprived of the right to enjoy substitute farming after joining mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives. In order to remove these ideological obstacles, the Party branches of many villages in Mancheng, Wangdu, and Fengrun counties have carefully studied the situation, and then convened Party member meetings, mutual aid and cooperation committees, and cadre meetings to deeply publicize the Party's general line during the transition period, and carried out patriotic education, so that they can further educate team members and cooperative members, explaining that absorbing families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations is a glorious political task, and explaining the close relationship between doing a good job in preferential treatment work and consolidating national defense and developing production. For the families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, they were educated on the glory of labor and the future of social development, and using concrete accounting, living people and events, and comparisons between people and events nearby, they were made to realize the benefits of participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and it was explained that those who should be substitute farmed would still enjoy substitute farming. As a result, 70 percent of the families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in these counties participated in mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives.

In view of the fact that the semi-able-bodied labor and female labor of families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers are relatively large, and the general labor is relatively weak and the technology is relatively poor, after absorbing them to participate in mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives, except for those with stronger labor, they generally let them do light work first, and assign special personnel to teach them to learn technology, and plan to let them do more work and distribute more grain to encourage their enthusiasm for production. The mutual aid team led by Zhang Defang in Huangyao Village, Handan County, organized Zhang Yangyun, a 68-year-old military dependent, and his 14-year-old child to participate in labor, doing light work such as winnowing and planting. Last year, Zhang Yangyun's family harvested more than 2,500 jin of grain from eighteen mu of upland, reaching the highest yield in the village, and also saved 790 jin of substitute farming grain. As a result, his family lived a very good life and also bought eight sheep and one head of livestock. The Zhoujiazhuang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Jin County let Yuan Dahe, a revolutionary disabled soldier with a leg injury, feed the livestock. Last year, he earned more than 200 workdays, and with the labor of the other four members of his family, his family received a total dividend of more than 6.8 million yuan at the end of the year. In addition to the family's necessary consumption, more than 3 million yuan was deposited in the cooperative. Yuan Shizhen, the director of the Junzikou Agricultural, Forestry, Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Zunhua County, and others, helped many families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to learn the technology of repairing fruit trees, enabling them to gradually improve their lives through labor production.

Since last winter and this spring, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has also issued 60 billion yuan in preferential treatment funds to purchase major means of production and subsidize families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers who have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The province has subsidized a total of 41.5 million jin of fertilizer; other subsidies, based on investigations in only 21 counties in three special districts such as Tianjin, include more than 1,500 head of cattle and donkeys, more than 3,200 sheep, 2,300 pigs, and more than 4,800 pieces of new-style farm implements such as walking plows and sprayers, and 400,500 jin of seeds. This has powerfully promoted the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After the 88 households of families of martyrs and military dependents in Gucheng County who had no livestock received the livestock issued by the People's Government, 53 households joined production cooperatives and 35 households joined mutual aid teams, which were very welcomed by the mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    河北省组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人等参加互助合作组织的经验
    刘登钟
    随着互助合作运动的发展，河北省在自愿互利的原则下，积极组织了烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作组织。目前全省烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人加入互助组和农业生产合作社的，已经占他们总户数的百分之六十左右。通县、沙河、临城、内邱和邢台等互助合作基础比较好的县，达到百分之八十。不少地区整区、整乡或整村的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加了互助合作组织，发挥了半劳力和妇女劳力参加生产的积极性，使代耕和互助合作运动紧密地结合起来。没有劳力的烈属、军属的土地，由互助组或农业生产合作社包耕、包产；能劳动的烈属、军属，参加互助组或农业生产合作社做活，同其他组员或社员同样评工记分，代耕工票交组顶工或交社顶劳动日。单干户应该负担的代耕工，用换工找款的办法解决。代耕工款如果低于劳动日应得的报酬，社内用代耕工款投资副业生产，然后再设法弥补；工票如果比劳动日应得的报酬高，把代耕工款原数交给烈属、军属。这样，大大地鼓舞了烈属、军属们的劳动热情，显著地提高了他们土地的单位面积产量，使他们逐步走向组织起来生产自给、大家富裕的社会主义道路。
    河北深泽县北赵乡八庄村三十五户入互助组入农业生产合作社的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人的小麦，今年每亩平均产二百六十斤，比去年每亩增产四十多斤。遵化县君子口村农林牧畜生产合作社，大量吸收烈属、军属的半劳力和妇女劳力参加生产，使他们的生活普遍得到改善。前年十三户没有入社的烈属、军属的粮食总产量是三万二千七百多斤，去年入社以后增加到四万二千六百多斤，每户平均增加七百六十多斤。随着粮食产量的提高，他们全部主动地谢绝了人民政府的补助，并有九户卖余粮四千二百多斤给人民政府。
    烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人加入互助组、加入农业生产合作社以后，在当地党、政府领导机关的培养和教育下，成了推动农业社会主义改造的骨干力量。参加唐山专区召开的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人代表会议的二百六十二名代表中，有二十九名是互助组组长，六十八名是农业生产合作社社长，他们在广大农民群众中很有威信，成为各地发展互助合作组织的模范人物。丰润县邵家街村烈属尹生、顺义县河南乡军属高桂珍、邯郸县西大屯村革命残废军人秦元照和蔚县富家庄复员建设军人李聚等，在推动互助合作组织的发展中，都起了很大的作用。全省烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人中的劳动模范和优抚模范占全省劳动模范总数的百分之二十五以上。
    为了做好组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作组织的工作，去年冬季在中共河北省委召开的互助合作会议中，曾经由河北省人民政府民政厅厅长作了“组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作生产”的报告，会议并明确指出了优抚工作的方向。会议以后，省委又发出“加强优抚工作”的指示，该省各级党委根据这一指示，分别进行了具体的组织工作。唐山专区、宣化市、通县等地以及满城等四十多县，先后召开了烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人代表会议，贯彻发展互助合作组织的政策和方针，号召“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，为实现农业的社会主义改造而积极努力。
    河北省各地在组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作生产中，有的乡、村干部有单纯照顾的观点，认为他们的困难有政府照顾，他们不参加互助合作组织也能解决问题；有的组员、社员对拥军优属的认识不足，嫌他们的半劳力和妇女劳力多，怕麻烦怕受累。而有的烈属、军属不积极生产，认为土地有人代耕，够吃、够穿就行了；也有的怕参加互助组或农业生产合作社以后要被取消享受代耕的权利。为了解除这些思想障碍，满城、望都和丰润等县很多村的党支部都仔细作过研究，然后召开党员大会、互助合作委员会和干部会议，都深入地宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线，并进行了爱国主义教育，使他们再向组员、社员进行教育，说明吸收烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作组织是光荣的政治任务，说明做好优抚工作对巩固国防和发展生产的密切关系。对烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人，则进行劳动光荣和社会发展前途的教育，用具体算账、活人活事、近人近事的对比方法，使他们认识到参加互助合作组织的好处，并说明应该代耕的，仍然享受代耕。结果，这些县的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人百分之七十参加了互助组、农业生产合作社。
    各互助组、农业生产合作社，鉴于烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人的半劳力、妇女劳力比较多，一般劳力比较弱、技术比较差，在吸收他们参加互助组或农业生产合作社以后，除了劳力比较强的外，都尽先把轻活让他们做，并专人负责教他们学会技术，有计划地让他们多做工多分粮食，以鼓舞他们生产的积极性。邯郸县黄窑村张德芳领导的互助组，组织六十八岁的军属张养云和他十四岁的小孩也参加劳动，做扬场、耩地等轻活。去年张养云家十八亩岗地收了两千五百多斤粮食，达到村里的最高产量，还节余七百九十斤代耕粮。结果他家生活过得很好，还买了八只羊一头牲口。晋县周家庄农业生产合作社，让腿部负伤的革命残废军人袁大合喂牲口。去年他记到二百多个劳动日，连家中其他四人的劳动，年底他家共分得红利六百八十多万元，除了全家必要的消费，还余下三百多万元存在社里。遵化县君子口农林牧畜生产合作社社长袁士珍等，帮助很多烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人学会了修理果树的技术以后，使他们从劳动生产中逐步改善了生活。
    去冬今春以来，河北省人民政府还发出优抚事业费六百亿元，购买主要的生产资料，补助加入互助合作组织的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人。全省共补助了肥料四千一百五十万斤；其他的补助，仅天津等三个专区二十一县的调查，就有牛和驴一千五百多头，羊三千二百多只，猪二千三百口，步犁、喷雾器等新式农具四千八百多件，籽种四十万零五千斤。这有力地促进了互助合作组织的发展。故城县八十八户没有畜力的烈属、军属，得到人民政府发给的牲口以后，五十三户参加了生产合作社，三十五户参加了互助组，很受互助组、农业生产合作社欢迎。
