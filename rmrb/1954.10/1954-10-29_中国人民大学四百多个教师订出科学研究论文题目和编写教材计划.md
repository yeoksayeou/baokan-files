More than 400 teachers at Renmin University of China have set more than 410 research paper topics and 50 plans for writing textbooks with a research focus. Nearly 100 of these topics concern the general task of the state during the transition period, the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

	Tang Shuping, Xu Jingqiu, and three other teachers from the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Office visited Yaoshangou in Wu乡 County, Shanxi Province, this year to collect information on class struggle in rural areas and the problems existing in the transition from semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives to socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives. They set out a research paper plan on "Several Problems of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives in Yaoshangou, Shanxi." The teachers of the Economic Geography Teaching and Research Office actively cooperated with relevant units in conducting investigations and discovered some problems existing in practical work, thus preparing materials for their papers. Many teachers, during their production internships, determined special research topics based on the actual problems they learned about through investigation. Most of the special research papers are combined with teaching content or textbook writing work. The teachers of the Department of Agricultural Economics have set out nine special research paper plans related to the income and distribution, production planning, and financial management of agricultural producers' cooperatives. The completion of these papers will result in a relatively complete textbook on agricultural producers' cooperatives. They have also entered into a regular contact agreement with an agricultural producers' cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing and the Nanyuan Agricultural Machine Tractor Station.

    中国人民大学四百多个教师
    订出科学研究论文题目和编写教材计划
    中国人民大学的四百多个教师订出了四百一十多个科学研究论文题目和编写五十种带有研究性的教材计划，其中有将近一百个题目是有关国家在过渡时期总任务、中国共产党四中全会决议和中华人民共和国宪法的问题。
    马克思列宁主义教研室唐淑平、徐景秋等五个教师，今年曾到山西省武乡县窑上沟进行访问和调查，搜集农村中阶级斗争和半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社如何过渡到社会主义的农业生产合作社所存在的问题的资料，订出了“山西窑上沟农业生产合作社的几个问题”的论文计划。经济地理教研室的教师们主动地配合有关单位进行调查工作时，发现实际工作中存在的一些问题，为论文准备了资料。不少教师在生产实习过程中，根据调查了解到的实际问题，确定了专题研究。大部分的专题论文，都结合教学内容或教材编写工作。农业经济系的教师们订出了有关农业生产合作社的收入和分配、生产计划、财务管理等九篇专题论文计划。这些论文的完成将成为一种有关农业生产合作社较完整的教材。他们并和北京市郊区的一个农业生产合作社和南苑农业机器拖拉机站订立了经常联系的合同。
