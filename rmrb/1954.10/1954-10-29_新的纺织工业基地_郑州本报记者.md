New Textile Industrial Base—Zhengzhou
By our reporter Chen Ji

\tThe western suburbs of Zhengzhou were originally farmland, but now modern textile factories have sprung up here. On July 1st of this year, the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory went into production. Its 50,000 spindles and 1,500 looms are now fully operational, and it will produce 50,000 bales of cotton yarn and 1.2 million bolts of fine cloth for the country each year. To the east of this factory, construction workers are building another new factory—the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, which is twice the size of the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, with 100,000 spindles, 34,000 thread spindles, and 2,500 looms. It will go into production next spring, and the variety of products will be greater than that of Factory No. 1. Preparations for the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory have also begun. In the future, a fifth cotton textile factory and a new type of cotton cloth printing and dyeing factory will also be established here. After these modern textile factories are completed, Zhengzhou will become a strong textile industrial base of New China.
\tZhengzhou is actually the best place to build a textile industry. Zhengzhou has developed transportation, located at the intersection of the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways, and is also the heart of Henan Province, a famous cotton-producing area in our country. Around Zhengzhou, large tracts of cotton fields can be seen everywhere. To the west are Luoyang and Lingbao, to the east is Shangqiu, and to the north is Anyang, all of which are producing high-quality cotton. The cotton here has a long fiber length, good color, and strong tensile strength, which is the best raw material for the textile industry. Zhengzhou has a mild climate, not hot; there is no plum rain season in the south of the Yangtze River, which is another favorable condition for building the textile industry.
\tThe Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, in order to rationally distribute industrial zones, bring industry closer to raw material producing areas, and improve the lives of people in various places, decided to build a textile industry in Zhengzhou. On July 1, 1952, the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory with 30,000 spindles was built. After only two years, Zhengzhou has now built and is about to complete cotton textile factories with nearly 200,000 spindles. This speed of development is unprecedented in the history of Chinese textiles.
\tThe Zhengzhou textile industry is built on the basis of the continuous development of my country's machinery manufacturing industry. All the machinery and equipment of the newly built textile factories in Zhengzhou are manufactured by our own country. Walking into Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, rows of light green machines attract people's attention. These machines come from textile machinery factories in Shanghai and Tianjin, some from textile machinery factories in the Northwest and Southwest, and some from the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory. These machines are all highly efficient. China's new type of reeling machine and warping machine all have automatic settings. As long as a thread breaks, it will automatically stop. However, the machine manufacturing workers are not satisfied with such achievements. They are still working hard to manufacture better textile machines. This year, the workers of Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory have manufactured nine new products. In the warehouse of Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, several single-process cotton openers have been packed into wooden boxes and are ready to be transported to Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory and newly built cotton textile factories in Shijiazhuang and Beijing. This single-process cotton opener can increase cotton cleaning output by 167% compared to the old two-process cotton opener. Now the workers of Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory are also mass-producing groove drum winders, which have never existed in Chinese history. In the assembly workshop, more than a dozen three-meter-long light green new winders are about to be assembled. This batch of winders is much better than the reciprocating winders commonly used in our country. It can rotate 3,000 revolutions per minute. It is also equipped with automatic equipment. When a yarn breaks, the bobbin will automatically pop up and will not idle, damaging the cotton yarn. The yarn it winds has no black spots, ensuring the quality of the cotton cloth. Next year, Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory will use all of this high-speed new winder.
\tWith the development of the textile industry in Zhengzhou, new technical forces are also growing rapidly. More than 80% of the workers in the fine spinning workshop and weaving workshop of Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory are new workers. Ten months ago, they had never seen a modern textile factory. Now, after only four months of study, they have become skilled workers. All the new workers in the fine spinning workshop can see 400 spindles per person, and some can see 600 spindles. All the new workers in the weaving workshop can see 24 looms per person. In the past, it would take at least several years for a new worker to reach such a high level of technical skill. Jing Liuniu, 19, was still a rural girl ten months ago. The first time she saw the whirring spinning frame, she didn't dare to touch the bobbin, fearing that the bobbin would break her hand. Once, she couldn't join a single broken end in a day. She secretly hid in the quilt and cried, blaming herself:
\t“Why am I so useless? The Party asked me to learn technology, and the factory is waiting for me to start work. Can I go on like this?” She made up her mind to study harder. In four months, she mastered the technology of fine spinning. Today, she stands in front of the spinning frame, watching over 400 spindles, looking very confident. When Liu Xiuyun, a weaver, first entered the weaving factory, she felt dizzy when she heard the sound of the looms like flowing water, and she didn't dare to approach the loom. Her teacher, Fan Taomei, a female weaver from Shanghai, kindly grabbed her hand and comforted her: "Little sister, don't be afraid, come with me. I am an advanced producer, and I will definitely teach you to become an advanced producer." Liu Xiuyun was very touched by her teacher's words. She said: "The teacher arrives early and leaves late, sacrificing rest time, and teaches me wholeheartedly; if I don't learn quickly, I will be letting down the teacher!" She studied driving, and even when she slept in bed, she used a broom to gesture the posture of driving. Sometimes, she dreamed that her hands were very flexible, like the teacher, skillfully threading the heddles and joining the ends. After more than three months, she was able to watch 32 looms. In the learning exam, she got a special prize. Now she is an excellent weaver in Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, and the cloth she weaves has very few defects. She told me gratefully: "I can weave good cloth today, thanks to the Shanghai teacher." The workers of Shanghai No. 2 and No. 5 Cotton Textile Factories gave up their holidays and taught them the latest technology in the fastest way in order to teach them well. After teaching them, some Shanghai female workers automatically asked to come to Zhengzhou to build the textile industry in Zhengzhou with them.
\tThe development of the textile industry in Zhengzhou has been welcomed and supported by the broad masses of peasants. In the wholesale department of Zhengzhou Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, I saw many farmers from the suburbs come to buy the standard fine cloth from Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. They all praised this fine cloth, saying that it was cheap and of excellent quality. Many farmers wrote letters to the textile workers in Zhengzhou, determined to increase the yield per unit area of cotton fields and support the construction of the textile industry. Zhang Jinliang, a member of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Kaifeng City, said: "In the past, I had to buy ten catties of wheat for one foot of black fine cloth; now it only takes three catties of wheat. We grow more cotton to support the country, which is also supporting all of us." He decided to increase cotton production by 10%. Zhou Chunlin, a farmer, didn't even have a spacious quilt before liberation, covering his head but not his feet. He said: "In recent years, Chairman Mao told us to organize and grow more cotton, and we exchanged new quilts and put on fine cloth clothes." Now he is working hard to strive for a bumper harvest of cotton. Last year, Henan farmers planted 10 million mu of cotton fields, and this year they planted 870,000 mu more than last year. 1937 was the year with the most cotton fields in Henan before liberation, but it only had 6 million mu. In 1929, Henan only harvested 17.1 jin of cotton per mu. This year, they will harvest 27.5 jin of cotton per mu. Now the farmers in Henan are working hard to improve their technology and strive for higher yields. With the support of the vast number of farmers and workers, the development prospects of the textile industry in Zhengzhou are undoubtedly very bright.

    新的纺织工业基地——郑州
    本报记者　陈迹
    郑州的西郊原来是一片农田，现在在这里出现了一座座现代化的纺织工厂。今年七月一日，国营郑州第一棉纺织厂投入生产，它拥有的五万枚纱锭和一千五百台织布机已经完全转动了，每年将给国家生产五万件棉纱和一百二十万匹细布。在这座工厂的东边，建筑工人们正在建设着另一座新厂——国营郑州第三棉纺织厂，它比国营郑州第一棉纺织厂大一倍，拥有十万枚纱锭、三万四千枚线锭和两千五百台织布机。它将在明年春天投入生产，生产的品种也比一厂多。国营郑州第四棉纺织厂也已经开始筹建。将来这里还要建立第五个棉纺织厂和新型的棉布印染厂。这些现代化的纺织工厂建成以后，将使郑州成为新中国一个强大的纺织工业基地。
    郑州市本是一个建设纺织工业最好的地方。郑州交通发达，处于京汉、陇海路的交叉点，又是我国著名的棉产区——河南省的腹心。在郑州的周围，到处可以看见大块的棉田。西有洛阳、灵宝，东有商邱，北有安阳，都是品质优良的棉花的产地。这里棉花的绒度长，色泽好，耐拉力强，是纺织工业最好的原料。郑州天气温和，不炎热；没有江南的黄梅雨季，又是建设纺织工业的有利条件。
    中国共产党和人民政府为了合理地分布工业区，使工业接近原料产地，改善各地人民的生活，决定在郑州建设纺织工业。一九五二年七月一日，修建了拥有三万枚纱锭的国营郑州第二棉纺织厂。经过短短的两年多时间，现在郑州已经建成和即将建成近二十万枚纱锭的棉纺织厂。这种发展的速度是中国纺织史上所没有过的。
    郑州纺织工业是建立在我国机器制造业不断发展的基础上的。郑州新建的纺织工厂的全部机器设备，都是我国自己制造的。走进郑州第一棉纺织厂，一排排淡绿的机器吸引着人们的视线。这些机器，有的来自上海和天津的纺织机械厂，有的来自西北和西南的纺织机械厂，有的来自郑州纺织机械厂。这些机器的效能都很高。中国的新型摇纱机、整经机，都有着自动的设置。只要有一根线断了，就会自动停车。但是机器制造工人们并不满足这样的成就，他们还在努力制造着更好的纺织机器，今年郑州纺织机械厂工人们已经制造出九种新产品。在郑州纺织机械厂的仓库里，好几座单程清花机已装进木箱，准备运往郑州第三棉纺织厂和石家庄、北京新建的棉纺织厂去。这种单程清花机比旧的二道清花机，要提高清棉的产量百分之一百六十七。现在郑州纺织机械厂工人又在大量地制造着中国历史上所没有的槽筒式络筒机。在装配车间里，十多台三公尺长的淡绿的新络筒机快要装好了。这批络筒机比我国常用的往返式络筒机优越多了。它每分钟能转三千转。在它上面还设有自动的设备。一根纱断了，纱管就会自动地跳起，不会发生空转，滚坏棉纱。它所络好的纱，没有黑色的斑点，保证了棉布的质量。明年郑州第三棉纺织厂将要全部采用这种高速度的新络筒机。
    随着郑州纺织工业的发展，新的技术力量也迅速地成长起来了。郑州第一棉纺织厂细纱车间和织布车间，百分之八十以上的工人是新工人。他们在十个月以前还没见过现代化的纺织工厂，现在他们只经过四个月的学习时间，都成了技术工人。细纱车间所有的新工人，每人都能看到四百枚纱锭，有的能看到六百枚纱锭。织布车间所有的新工人，每人都能看二十四台织布机。过去一个新工人要达到这样高的技术水平，至少要工作好几年。十九岁的井留妞在十个月以前还是一个农村姑娘。她第一次看见呼呼转动的细纱机，简直不敢去摸动纱管，生怕纱管碰断她的手，曾经在一天之内，没有能接上一根断头，她偷偷地躲在被窝里流泪，责备自己：
  “我为什么这样不中用？党让我学技术，工厂等我开工，我能这样下去吗？”她下定决心，更加努力地学习，四个月就掌握了细纱工的技术。今天她一个人站在细纱机前面看管着四百枚纱锭，显出很有把握的样子。织布工刘秀云初次走进织布厂，听到流水般的哗啦哗啦的织布声，感到头昏眼花，不敢走近织布机，她的老师——上海女织布工范桃妹便亲切地抓住她的手，安慰她说：“小妹妹，不要怕，跟我来，我是个先进生产者，我一定也把你教成一个先进生产者。”刘秀云听了老师的话，很感动。她说：“老师早到迟退，牺牲休息时间，全心全意教我；我不赶快学会，也对不起老师呀！”她学习开车，睡在床上也用帚子比划着开车的姿态。有时候，她梦见自己的手很灵活，像老师一样熟练地穿扣、接头。这样经过三个多月时间，她就能看三十二台织布机了。学习考试，她得了个特等奖。现在她已经是郑州第一棉纺织厂的优秀的挡车工，织出的布很少有废品。她很感激地告诉我：“我今天能织出好布，要感谢上海老师。”国营上海第二、第五棉纺织厂的工人，为了教好她们，放弃自己的假日，用最快的方法把最新的技术传授给她们。有些上海女工在教会了她们以后，又自动地要求到郑州来，跟她们一道建设郑州的纺织工业。
    郑州纺织工业的发展，得到了广大农民群众的欢迎和支持。在郑州花纱布公司的批发部里，我看见许多郊区的农民来购买郑州第一棉纺织厂的标准细布。他们都夸奖这种细布，说这种细布价钱便宜，品质优良。许多农民写信给郑州纺织工人，决心提高棉田的单位面积产量，支援纺织工业的建设。开封市郊红光农业生产合作社社员张金良说：“从前俺买一尺黑细布，要十斤麦子；现在只要三斤麦子。俺多种棉花支援国家，也就是支援咱们大伙儿。”他决定要把棉花产量提高一成。农民周春霖解放前连个宽敞被子都没有，盖着头盖不着脚。他说：“这几年毛主席叫咱组织起来多种棉花，咱才换上新被子，穿上细布衣。”现在他正在努力争取棉花的丰收。去年河南农民种了一千万亩棉田，今年又比去年多种了八十七万亩。一九三七年是解放前河南棉田最多的一年，但也只有六百万亩。一九二九年河南每亩棉田只收到十七点一斤棉花。今年他们每亩要收获二十七点五斤棉花。现在河南农民们正在努力改进技术，争取更高的产量。在广大农民和工人的支援下，郑州纺织工业的发展前途无疑是十分光明的。
