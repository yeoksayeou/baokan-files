China and India, as well as other Asian countries, need a lasting peaceful environment to build their economies and raise the living standards of their people.” He said that the Chinese Trade Delegation's visit to India this time is to make further efforts in economic exchange, which is based on the already existing and developing friendly relations between the two countries.

    Head of Delegation Kong Yuan also said: “Based on the growing needs, abundant resources and economic construction development of our two countries, and through the joint efforts and sincere cooperation of our two governments and industrial and commercial enterprises, I firmly believe that it is highly possible to develop economic and trade relations between our two countries more extensively.”
