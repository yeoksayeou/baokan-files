Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from New York: According to TASS, the head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, delivered a speech at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 30.

    In his speech, Vyshinsky pointed out that the United States' obstruction of China's acquisition of its legitimate seat in the United Nations is illegal and violates the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law. He said: The Soviet delegation will continue to point out the abnormal nature of this situation. The Soviet delegation is convinced that this legitimate demand should be met, and that China's participation in the work of the United Nations will make a significant contribution to the efforts of peace-loving countries in the United Nations.
    Vyshinsky then elaborated on the Soviet Union's peace policy. He said: The Soviet Union is convinced that it is entirely possible to resolve outstanding international issues in accordance with the interests of peace and international security if the principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, and if all countries respect each other's rights and interests and fulfill their international obligations. Vyshinsky said: The Soviet government, on the one hand, is developing the Soviet Union's peaceful economic construction with all its strength, and on the other hand, is taking all necessary steps to ensure the development of normal political relations with other countries and to ensure the normalization of international relations. Maintaining peace and consolidating international cooperation is the basis and purpose of Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet government opposes the formation of exclusive, narrow blocs by certain countries, and sincerely welcomes the Five Principles formulated by China and India, and China and Burma in June of this year.
    Vyshinsky pointed out that the current session of the United Nations General Assembly is being held under the circumstances that the international tension has somewhat eased after the cessation of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina. This situation is largely due to the Berlin Four-Power Conference, especially the Geneva Conference.
    Vyshinsky then talked about the threat posed to European and world security by the policy of arming West Germany pursued by Western countries headed by the United States. He said that the failure of the "European Defense Community" treaty in France was a great victory for the forces of peace. At the same time, it is also a heavy blow to the policy of "strength." It is a serious warning to war instigators, war propagandists, and organizers. Now the supporters of the "European Defense Community" are looking for substitutes similar to the "European Defense Community." Vyshinsky said that the issue of European security and the German issue are absolutely inseparable. Life has proven that it is impossible to solve the German issue unless the European security issue is resolved. At the same time, solving the German issue will undoubtedly promote the solution of the Austrian issue as well.
    Vyshinsky said that solving the Korean issue is of great importance. Although no positive solution to the Korean issue was reached in Geneva, the Korean issue must be urgently resolved in the interests of national reunification and safeguarding world peace. The solution to the Korean issue is even more necessary because the Syngman Rhee clique is attempting to systematically undermine the Korean armistice and re-launch a war against the Korean people. Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly must make every effort to resolve this issue. The so-called "common defense" treaty signed by the United States and South Korea undoubtedly creates a serious obstacle to the solution of the Korean issue. The Soviet delegation believes that the countries concerned should continue to work towards an agreement to peacefully resolve the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic state.
    Vyshinsky rebuked certain countries headed by the United States for holding the Manila Conference and establishing the Southeast Asia Group. He said that the refusal of most Asian countries to participate and the opposition of the People's Republic of China convincingly exposed the falsity of the claim that the purpose of the so-called Manila Conference and the treaty it signed was to "defend" Southeast Asian countries. The so-called plan to "defend" Southeast Asia is similar to the plan for the Korean War: that is, to organize foreign intervention and to involve some small Asian countries in order to cover up the special interests of the colonialists in controlling this region. This plan is a plan to suppress the national liberation movement in Southeast Asian countries, and it attempts to turn some Asian countries against other Asian countries.
    Vyshinsky pointed out that the United States' so-called "massive retaliation" plan is used to confuse public opinion, and it is actually preparing to launch a pre-emptive war. Vyshinsky cited facts to show that the United States is stepping up its arms expansion. American militarists are accumulating atomic and hydrogen weapons on a large scale, while they are completely uninterested in the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    Vyshinsky said that the correspondence between the Soviet Union and the United States on atomic energy negotiations has now been published. This makes it possible to study in detail the position taken by the Soviet Union on steps for the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Union believes that it is necessary to reach an international agreement to ensure that atomic energy is not used for military purposes, and to make it possible to use atomic energy entirely for peaceful purposes. The possibility of reaching an agreement in this regard should not be regarded as exhausted. As for the Soviet proposal that all countries should abandon the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons, its necessity has not only not disappeared, but is even more urgent.
    Vyshinsky also talked about the huge damage brought to other capitalist countries by the United States' trade restriction measures and the embargo measures against China and North Korea. He said: Obviously, the elimination of artificial obstacles to normal trade and economic relations has become an urgent need. As for the Soviet Union, it pursues a foreign trade policy of consolidating and freely and widely developing international economic relations, which is an inseparable part of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.
    Vyshinsky said: The Soviet Union firmly and consistently defends peace, and firmly advocates taking major and fundamental measures to avoid the threat of another world war. The Soviet Union is convinced that the United Nations General Assembly can and must resolve this issue to meet the aspirations of all peoples for peace and security.
    Vyshinsky finally submitted to the General Assembly a proposal on the conclusion of an international convention on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Vyshinsky also expressed his hope that this proposal would be given the most careful study. The full text of the proposal is as follows:
    "On the conclusion of an international convention (treaty) on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction

    Part One

    The General Assembly instructs the United Nations Disarmament Commission to draft a draft international convention (treaty) for submission to the Security Council for adoption, the purpose of which is to strengthen peace and international security, and which, based on the proposals of France and the United Kingdom on June 11, 1954, stipulates the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, the removal of these weapons from the armaments of countries, large-scale disarmament, and the establishment of an international supervisory system to supervise the implementation of these decisions.

    In accordance with this, the convention (treaty) should contain the following basic provisions:

    1. Implement the following measures simultaneously:

    A. All countries should, within six months (or one year), reduce armaments, armed forces and budgetary appropriations for national military needs, the amount of the reduction being fifty percent of a mutually agreed amount. The reduction of armaments and armed forces should take as its starting point the level of armaments and armed forces as of December 31, 1953, and the reduction of appropriations should take as its starting point the level of expenditures for military needs for the one year ending December 31, 1953.

    B. In order to supervise the fulfillment by countries of their obligations to reduce armaments and armed forces as stipulated in item A, a provisional international supervisory commission should be established under the Security Council, which has the right to require countries to provide necessary information on measures taken to reduce armaments and armed forces. The committee shall take necessary measures to supervise the fulfillment by countries of their obligations to reduce armaments and armed forces and to reduce appropriations for military needs. Countries shall periodically provide the committee with information on the implementation of the measures stipulated in the convention at specifically prescribed times.

    2. In order to complete the measures stipulated in Section 1, the following measures should be implemented simultaneously:

    A. All countries should, within six months (or one year), further reduce armaments, armed forces and budgetary appropriations for national military needs by fifty percent of a mutually agreed amount, the reduction of armaments and armed forces taking as its starting point the level of armaments and armed forces as of December 31, 1953, and the reduction of appropriations taking as its starting point the level of expenditures for military needs for the one year ending December 31, 1953.

    B. Completely prohibit atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, stop the manufacture of these types of weapons, and completely eliminate these weapons from national armaments; all existing atomic materials should only be used for peaceful purposes.

    The date for the completion of the implementation of all these measures shall be no later than the implementation of the measures for the reduction of armaments and armed forces stipulated in item A of Section 2. As soon as the reduction of armaments, armed forces and military needs appropriations by another fifty percent of a mutually agreed amount begins, the manufacture of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons should be stopped immediately.

    C. All countries should establish permanent international bodies to supervise the implementation of the convention (treaty) on the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, the cessation of the manufacture of these weapons, the elimination of these weapons from national armaments, and the reduction of armaments, armed forces and military needs appropriations. In addition, such international bodies should be authorized to carry out supervision on a scale necessary to ensure the implementation of the above-mentioned convention by all countries, including inspections on a permanent basis.

      Part Two

    As for the proposals contained in the memorandum submitted by France and the United Kingdom on June 11, 1954, on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons except for defense against aggression, the United Nations General Assembly instructs the United Nations Disarmament Commission to study and clarify this issue and submit recommendations."
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd dispatch: An. Ya. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation attending the ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly, sent a letter to the Chairman of the General Assembly as follows:

      "I have the honor to request you to include the following item on the agenda of the ninth session of the General Assembly as an important and urgent issue: 'On the conclusion of an international convention (treaty) on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.'
    "Mr. Chairman, I request you to order the distribution of the attached proposal on this issue as an official document of the General Assembly."

    关于裁减军备禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题
    苏联代表团建议缔结国际公约
    并要求联大主席把苏联提案列入联大议程
    【新华社三日讯】　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基于九月三十日在联合国大会全体会议上发表演说。
    维辛斯基在演说中指出，美国阻挠中国取得在联合国中的合法席位，这种立场是不合法的，并违反了联合国宪章和国际法的原则。他说：苏联代表团将继续不断地指出这种状况的不正常性质。苏联代表团深信，这一合法要求应予满足，并深信，中国参加联合国的工作，将对爱好和平国家在联合国中的努力，作出重大的贡献。
    维辛斯基接着阐明苏联的和平政策。他说：苏联深信，如果各国主权平等和不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，如果各国互相尊重彼此的权利和利益，并履行自己的国际义务，按照和平和国际安全的利益解决悬而未决的国际问题，是完全有可能的。维辛斯基说：苏联政府一方面以一切力量发展苏联的和平经济建设，另一方面又采取一切必要步骤，来保证和其他国家间正常政治关系的发展，来保证国际关系的正常化。维护和平和巩固国际合作，这就是苏联外交政策的基础和宗旨。苏联政府反对某些国家成立排他的、狭隘的集团，并竭诚欢迎中印两国和中缅两国在今年六月间所拟订的五项原则。
    维辛斯基指出：联合国大会本届会议，是在朝鲜战争停止、印度支那和平恢复之后国际紧张局势已有某种缓和的情况下召开的。这种情况大部分要归功于柏林四国会议，特别是日内瓦会议。
    维辛斯基接着谈到以美国为首的西方国家所奉行的武装西德政策对欧洲和世界安全所造成的威胁。他说，“欧洲防务集团”条约在法国的失败，是和平力量的巨大胜利。同时，它也是对于“实力”政策的一个沉重打击。它是对于战争挑拨者、战争宣传者和组织者的严重警告。现在“欧洲防务集团”的拥护者们正在找寻类似“欧洲防务集团”的替代物。维辛斯基说：欧洲安全问题和德国问题是绝对分不开的。生活已经证明，除非欧洲安全问题得到解决，否则解决德国问题是不可能的。同时，解决德国问题无疑也会促进奥地利问题的解决。
    维辛斯基说：解决朝鲜问题是有很大重要性的。虽然在日内瓦没有得出解决朝鲜问题的积极办法，然而，为了朝鲜全国统一和保障世界和平的利益，朝鲜问题必须迫切地加以解决。由于李承晚分子正在企图有步骤地破坏朝鲜停战和重新对朝鲜人民发动战争，解决朝鲜问题就更加必要了。因此，联合国大会必须尽一切努力来解决这一问题。美国和南朝鲜签订的所谓“共同防御”条约，无疑地给朝鲜问题的解决，造成了严重的障碍。苏联代表团认为，有关国家应该继续努力，以便达成协议，在建立统一、独立、民主国家的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题。
    维辛斯基斥责以美国为首的若干国家举行马尼拉会议，建立东南亚集团。他说，多数亚洲国家的拒绝参加以及中华人民共和国的反对这件事本身就令人信服地揭穿了所谓马尼拉会议及其所签订的条约目的在于“防卫”东南亚国家的说法的虚伪性。所谓“防卫”东南亚的计划，是和朝鲜战争的计划类似的：即在组织外国干涉，并要某些亚洲小国参加，以便掩盖殖民者在控制这一区域方面的特殊利益。这个计划是镇压东南亚国家民族解放运动的计划，它企图使一些亚洲国家反对另一些亚洲国家。
    维辛斯基指出：美国所谓“大规模报复”的计划是用来迷惑舆论的，它实际上是要准备发动一个先发制人的战争。维辛斯基引用事实说明美国正在加紧进行扩军。美国军国主义者正在大规模积累原子武器和氢武器，另一方面对于和平利用原子能，却完全不感兴趣。
    维辛斯基说：苏联和美国之间关于原子能谈判的往来信件现已公布。这使人有可能详尽地研究苏联对于和平使用原子能的步骤所采取的立场。苏联认为有必要达成一项国际协定，以保证防止把原子能用于军事目的，并使得有可能把原子能完全用于和平目的。在这方面达成协议的可能性，绝不能认为都已殆尽了。至于苏联所提各国应放弃使用原子武器和氢武器的建议，其必要性不仅绝未消失，而且是更加迫切了。
    维辛斯基还谈到美国的贸易限制措施以及对中朝两国的禁运措施给其他资本主义国家所带来的巨大损害。他说：显然，取消对于正常贸易和经济关系的人为障碍，已是一个迫切的需要了。至于苏联，它奉行着巩固和自由地、广泛地发展国际经济关系的对外贸易政策，这种政策是苏联和平外交政策的一个不可分离的部分。
    维辛斯基说：苏联坚决地、始终不渝地保卫和平，并坚决主张采取重大的、根本性的措施来避免另一次世界大战的威胁。苏联深信，联合国大会能够而且必须解决这一问题，以满足各国人民要求和平与安全的愿望。
    维辛斯基最后向大会提出关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约的提案。维辛斯基并表示希望这一提案将得到最仔细的研究。提案的全文如下：
    “关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约（条约）
    第一部分
    大会训令联合国裁减军备委员会起草一项国际公约（条约）草案，提交安全理事会通过，这个公约以加强和平和国际安全为目的，并以法国和英国一九五四年六月十一日的建议为基础，规定禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器，从国家的军备中取消这些武器，大量裁减军备，并建立国际监督制度以监督这些决定的实施。

    乙、为了监督各国履行甲项所规定的裁减军备及武装部队的义务，应在安全理事会下成立一个临时国际监督委员会，委员会有权要求各国提供必需的关于采取裁减军备及武装部队的措施的情报。委员会应采取必要措施监督各国履行裁减军备及武装部队和削减军事需要拨款的义务。各国应按具体规定的时间定期向委员会提供关于实施公约中所规定的措施的情报。
    二、为了使第一节规定的措施完备起见，下列措施应予同时执行：
    甲、各国应在六个月（或一年）内把军备、武装部队和国家军事需要预算拨款再削减一致同意的定额的百分之五十，军备及武装部队的裁减以一九五三年十二月三十一日的军备及武装部队水平为起算点，拨款的削减以截至一九五三年十二月三十一日为止的一年度的军事需要费用水平为起算点。
    乙、完全禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器，停止制造这些类型的武器，并从国家军备中完全取消这些武器；一切现有的原子原料都只应用于和平用途。
    所有这些措施实施完毕的日期不得迟于第二节甲项所规定的裁减军备及武装部队的措施的实施。一俟开始把军备、武装部队和军事需要拨款再削减一致同意的定额的百分之五十，就应立即停止制造原子武器及氢武器。
    丙、各国应建立永久性的国际机构，以监督实施关于禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器、停止这些武器的制造、从国家军备中取消这些武器、并削减军备、武装部队和军事需要拨款的公约（条约）。此外，应该授权这样一个国际机构在保证一切国家实施上述公约所必需的规模上进行监督，包括在永久性基础上进行视察。
      第二部分
    至于法国和英国一九五四年六月十一日提出的关于除为防御侵略外禁止使用核子武器的备忘录中包含的建议，联合国大会训令联合国裁减军备委员会研究和明确这个问题，并提出建议。”
