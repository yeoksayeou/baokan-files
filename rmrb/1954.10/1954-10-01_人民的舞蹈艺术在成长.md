    The great victory of the Chinese revolution has opened up broad avenues for the development of Chinese dance art. In the past five years, dance art has achieved healthy development under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. The government has established professional dance troupes in some cities with suitable conditions. The broad masses of working people love dance; in factories, military units, and schools, hundreds and thousands of amateur dance groups have been organized one after another. They perform at evening parties, they hold competitions. In the countryside, during festivals, talented folk artists perform various wonderful dances, and the peasants also dance very happily.
    Our country is a country with a long tradition of cultural art, and dance art is very rich. In recent years, we have created some excellent dance programs; these dances express the people's joy and excitement over victory, and their praise for the new life; they also express the Chinese people's wisdom, diligence, and courageous character, as well as their love of peace, and their firm will and desire to defend peace. At the three World Youth and Students Peace and Friendship Festivals held in Budapest, Hungary in 1949, Berlin, German Democratic Republic in 1951, and Bucharest, Romania in 1953, our dances "Yangko," "Waist Drum," folk dances "Red Silk Dance," "Lion Dance," "Lotus Dance," "Donkey Ride," and classical dances "San Cha Kou," "Havoc in Heaven," and "Water Battle" won international awards. Through these programs, the people of the world have gained a correct understanding of the Chinese people; at the same time, it has also won glorious honor for our great motherland.
    In the past few years, our dance workers have also participated in activities to comfort the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, expressing the motherland's people's concern and love for the most beloved people. We often perform for workers and peasants, inspiring their enthusiasm for labor and production. We have also traveled thousands of miles to minority areas to offer our regards and promote propaganda, learning the excellent dance art of our fraternal ethnic groups.
    Our new dance art in China has grown up in the process of struggling against various erroneous artistic ideas. Just imagine, if we had not gone through the rectification campaign in literature and art in these few years, had not studied the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," and had not held the first national folk music and dance performance in 1953, it would have been impossible to eliminate the erroneous artistic ideas of the bourgeoisie among us who did not value national traditions. In the course of these years of work, I have deeply realized that as long as we advance in accordance with Chairman Mao's line on literature and art, we will surely achieve success and victory. On the contrary, once we deviate from it, we will suffer failure and make mistakes.
    The government attaches great importance to the development of dance art. In order to rapidly advance Chinese dance art and lay a solid foundation for greater development in the future, we have established a dance school with the help of Soviet dance experts. China's first formal six-year dance school has opened, which is a great event in Chinese dance art. Only in this way can we systematically cultivate dance actors with high skills and artistic accomplishment, so that the Chinese people can enjoy dance performances with a higher artistic level in the near future. This is our dream for many years! Only today, in the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has our dream become a reality. As a dance worker, I really don't know what language to use to express my heartfelt gratitude and love for the Party and Chairman Mao.
    Our work is still far from meeting the requirements of reality, and far from meeting the requirements of the broad masses of people; we must study harder, study the creation methods, dance techniques, and advanced experience of Soviet socialist realism dance art, we must go deep into the struggle life of the people for a long time, we must explore the dance art buried among the people, accept the excellent classical dance art traditions of China, create more excellent dance programs for the people, and do more work for the construction of our great socialist motherland.

    人民的舞蹈艺术在成长

    中国革命的伟大胜利给中国舞蹈艺术的发展开辟了广阔的道路。五年来，舞蹈艺术在毛主席文艺方针的光辉照耀下获得了健康的发展。政府在一些有条件的城市建立了专业的舞蹈团体。广大的劳动人民热爱舞蹈；在工厂、部队、学校，成百成千的业余舞蹈小组相继地组织起来。他们在晚会上演出，他们举行竞赛。在农村，每逢节日，天才的民间艺人表演着各种精彩的舞蹈，农民们也非常欢乐地跳着舞。
    我国是一个有着悠久文化艺术传统的国家，舞蹈艺术是非常丰富的。这几年，我们创作了一些优秀的舞蹈节目；这些舞蹈表现了人民对胜利的欢欣鼓舞、对新生活的歌颂；也表现了中国人民智慧、勤劳和勇敢的性格，以及对和平的热爱、保卫和平坚强的意志和愿望。一九四九年在匈牙利布达佩斯、一九五一年在德意志民主共和国柏林、一九五三年在罗马尼亚布加勒斯特分别举行的三次世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节中，我们的舞蹈“秧歌”、
  “腰鼓”，民间舞“红绸舞”、“狮舞”、“荷花舞”、“跑驴”，古典舞“三岔口”、“闹天宫”、“水战”等获得了国际的奖励。通过这些节目使世界人民对中国人民有了正确的认识和了解；同时，也给我们伟大的祖国争得了光辉的荣誉。
    几年来，我们舞蹈工作者还数次参加慰问人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的活动，向最可爱的人表达祖国人民对他们的关怀和热爱。我们经常为工人和农民演出，鼓舞他们劳动生产的热情。我们也曾跋涉千里，去到少数民族地区进行慰问和宣传，学习兄弟民族的优秀舞蹈艺术。
    我国新的舞蹈艺术是在和各种错误的艺术思想作斗争的过程中成长起来的。试想，这几年若没有经过文艺整风，没有对电影“武训传”的批判的学习，没有一九五三年举办的全国第一届民间音乐舞蹈会演，要肃清我们中间存在着的资产阶级的不重视民族传统的错误艺术思想是不可能的。在这几年的工作当中，我深深地体会到，只要按照毛主席的文艺方针前进，我们一定会获得成功和胜利。相反，一旦脱离了它，那就会遭到失败，就会犯错误。
    政府非常重视舞蹈艺术的发展。为了使中国的舞蹈艺术迅速地前进，和为将来更大的发展打下稳固的基础，在苏联舞蹈专家的帮助下，我们今年建立了舞蹈学校。中国第一所正规的六年制舞蹈学校已经开学了，这是中国舞蹈艺术界一件大喜事。这样，才可能有计划地培养出具有高度技巧和艺术修养的舞蹈演员，使中国人民在不久的将来能够欣赏有更高艺术水平的舞蹈演出。这是我们多少年来的梦想啊！只有在今天，在毛主席领导下的新中国，我们的梦想才变成了现实。我，作为一个舞蹈工作者，真不知道要用什么样的语言来表达我内心对党对毛主席的衷心的感激和热爱。
    我们的工作距离现实要求还差得很远，还远不能满足广大人民的要求；我们只有更努力的学习，学习苏联社会主义现实主义舞蹈艺术的创作方法，舞蹈技术及先进经验，我们要长期地深入人民的斗争生活，我们要挖掘埋藏在人民中间的舞蹈艺术，接受中国优秀的古典舞蹈艺术传统，为人民创作出更多的优秀舞蹈节目，为建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国做更多的工作。
