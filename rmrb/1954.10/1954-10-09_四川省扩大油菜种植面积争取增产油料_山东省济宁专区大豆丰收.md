    Sichuan Province, a major rapeseed-producing area, plans to expand its rapeseed planting area by more than 330,000 mu this autumn, aiming to increase total rapeseed production by 18.3% compared to this year. Currently, farmers along both banks of the Yangtze River have begun sowing rapeseed.
    In order to increase rapeseed production according to the national plan, Party and government organs and relevant departments at all levels in Sichuan Province are taking necessary measures to help farmers increase yield per unit area while guiding them to expand the rapeseed planting area. In the main rapeseed-producing areas of Wenjiang, Luzhou, Neijiang, Mianyang and other eight prefectures, counties are successively holding training classes for farmer technicians to summarize and impart advanced rapeseed production technology and experience. More than 300,000 jin of improved rapeseed seeds have been transported to various places and have begun to be supplied to farmers. Wenjiang Prefecture will promote the improved variety "Japanese Rapeseed" on 350,000 mu. Longchang County plans to promote improved rapeseed varieties on 16,000 mu, and half of this area has already been sown. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Farmers in Jining Prefecture, Shandong Province, have achieved bumper harvests on most of the 4,450,000 mu of soybeans planted this year according to the national plan. Farmers are now working hard on the harvest. According to surveys and understanding in various counties, the average yield per mu in the entire area can reach more than 115 jin, and it is estimated that the increase in production plan can be completed by 110% to 120%. The total output will exceed last year's by more than 150% (production was reduced last year due to drought), an increase of more than 10% compared to 1952.
    When the soybeans were about to ripen, agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places led mutual aid teams and individual farmers in timely discussions on methods for careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain was brought home. The Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Central Store of the Tenth District of Zou County, remembering the lessons of rough harvesting last year, which resulted in a loss of seven or eight jin of soybeans per mu, a total loss of more than 600 jin for the whole cooperative, is ensuring that harvesting is done section by section, as each section ripens on the 60.4 mu of soybeans being harvested this year. The Wang Zhengqian mutual aid team of Gangshang Township, Eighth District of Wenshang County, organized eight children to follow the sickle and pick up soybeans, with each person picking up an average of more than four jin per day. The Lin Xianpu mutual aid team of Jigou Township, First District of the county, threshed the soybean stalks one more time than in previous years, which enabled them to collect an additional seven or eight jin per mu. In order to harvest section by section, farmers in the Fourth District of Jining County divided the 2,250 mu of soybeans in the entire district and harvested them in two or three stages.

    四川省扩大油菜种植面积争取增产油料
    山东省济宁专区大豆丰收
    盛产油菜籽的四川省，在今年秋种中计划扩大油菜播种面积三十三万多亩，明年收获时要求油菜籽总产量比今年增加百分之十八点三。目前，长江两岸的农民已开始播种油菜。
    为了按照国家计划增产油菜籽，四川省各地党、政机关和有关部门在领导农民扩大油菜播种面积的同时，还采取了必要的措施来帮助农民提高单位面积产量。在油菜籽的主要产区温江、泸州、内江、绵阳等八个专区，各县正陆续举办农民技术员训练班，总结和传授油菜的先进生产技术经验。三十多万斤良种油菜的种籽已运到各地，开始供应农民。温江专区将推广良种“日本油菜”三十五万亩。隆昌县计划推广良种油菜一万六千亩，现在已有半数播种。　（新华社）
    山东省济宁专区农民，今年按照国家计划播种的四百四十五万多亩大豆，绝大部分都获得丰收。农民们现正紧张进行收割。据各县调查了解，全区每亩平均产量可达一百一十五斤以上，估计可完成增产计划的百分之一百一十至一百二十。总产量将可超过去年的百分之一百五十以上（去年因旱减产），比一九五二年增产一成多。
    当豆子快成熟的时候，各地农业生产合作社带动互助组和单干农民，及时讨论了精收细打、颗粒还家的办法。邹县十区中心店前进农业生产合作社，记取去年收割粗糙，每亩少收豆子七、八斤，全社损失六百余斤的教训，今年收割六十亩四分豆子都做到熟一片收一片。汶上县八区岗上乡王正谦互助组，组织八个儿童跟镰拾豆子，每人每天平均拾四斤多。该县一区姬沟乡林现仆互助组，豆秸子比往年又多轧了一遍，每亩能多收七、八斤。济宁县四区农民为了作到熟一片收一片，全区有二千二百五十亩豆子都是分两三次割完的。
