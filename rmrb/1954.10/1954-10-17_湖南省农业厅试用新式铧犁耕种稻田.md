To cooperate with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and to do a good job in promoting new-style agricultural tools, the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture established two new-style animal-powered agricultural tool experiment stations this autumn at the Provincial Agricultural Experiment General Farm and the Changde Prefectural No. 1 Farm, respectively, to plow rice paddies with new-style agricultural tools, with good results. The third cultivation area of the Provincial Agricultural Experiment General Farm used a double-wheeled, single-moldboard plow to plow rice paddies on a large area, which could plow six inches deep and eight inches wide, and was both flat and stable. This proves that this kind of plow is not only suitable for plowing dry land, but also suitable for plowing rice paddies (terraced fields). (Our Hunan Reporter Station)

    湖南省农业厅试用新式铧犁耕种稻田
    湖南省人民政府农业厅为配合互助合作运动的发展，做好新式农具的推广工作，于今年秋季先后在省农业试验总场与常德专署一农场建立了两个新式畜力农具试验站，以新式农具耕犁水稻田，效果很好。省农业试验总场第三耕作区在大面积上使用双轮一铧犁翻犁稻田，可以犁六寸深、八寸宽，又平，又稳；证明这种犁不仅可犁旱地，也适宜犁水稻田（板田）。　（本报湖南记者站）
