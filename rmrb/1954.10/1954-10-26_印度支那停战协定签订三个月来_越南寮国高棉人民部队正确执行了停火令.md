Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: The Vietnam News Agency, on October 21st, summarized the implementation of the Indochina Armistice Agreement over the past three months, stating that it has been three months since the signing of the Indochina Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities on July 21st. The Vietnam People's Army, the Laotian Fighting Units, and the Khmer Resistance Forces have correctly implemented the ceasefire order in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

In Vietnam: The work of exchanging prisoners of war has been basically completed; however, the French side is still detaining some political prisoners and prisoners of war. The work of temporary regroupment of both armed forces has been completed within the prescribed time limit. The transfer of the People's Army units in southern Vietnam to the north of the 17th parallel is underway; the People's Army units in the temporary garrison area of ​​Ham Tan-Cua Mong and the first batch of People's Army units in the Fifth Interzone (southern central Vietnam) have arrived in the north. The People's Army units stationed in the Dong Thap Muoi temporary garrison area in South Vietnam are now en route north. As for the other side, the French Union forces have withdrawn from several provinces in North Vietnam, as well as Hanoi and its surrounding areas; the work of the Vietnam People's Army in liberating the capital has been successfully completed.

In the future, the issues that need to be further addressed in Vietnam are military regroupment, the release of still-detained prisoners of war, and the reception of the Hai Duong area. In addition, the following issues will also be discussed and resolved: military cemeteries, supervision of the import of weapons from outside Vietnam, troop rotation, foreign military bases in Vietnam, and guaranteeing the Vietnamese people in southern Vietnam enjoy democratic freedoms.

In Cambodia: The Khmer Resistance Forces have completed their demobilization on the spot, and Vietnamese volunteers have withdrawn from Cambodia to Vietnam. The transfer of prisoners of war and civilians has been basically completed.

In Laos: Agreements on military regroupment and withdrawal issues were concluded on August 29th and 30th. Currently, the Laotian Fighting Units are heading to the regroupment areas in the two northern Laotian provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, while Vietnamese People's Volunteers are returning to Vietnam. The Laotian Fighting Units have completed the work of releasing prisoners of war.

In the future, the issues that remain to be resolved in Laos and Cambodia include: the issue of military cemeteries, the issue of overseas Vietnamese residing in Cambodia and Laos, the supervision of the import of weapons from foreign countries, and the issue of foreign military bases in Cambodia and Laos. As far as Cambodia is concerned, enabling all Cambodian citizens to participate in the common life of the country is an important issue to be resolved.
