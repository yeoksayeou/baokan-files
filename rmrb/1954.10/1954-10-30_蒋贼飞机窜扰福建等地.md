Xinhua News Agency, 29th. From 19:55 on October 27th to 01:04 on October 28th, Chiang bandit planes intruded into the mainland airspace of Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces ten times in succession, one plane each time, to carry out harassment. They also scattered anti-China reactionary leaflets in Danyang, Jintan, Wuxi, and Changzhou in Jiangsu Province; Xindeng and Suian in Zhejiang Province; and Ningguo in Anhui Province. In some areas, special agents who attempted to carry out sabotage activities were also found parachuting from Chiang bandit planes.

The crime of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in using aircraft to intrude into the mainland of the motherland for harassment has aroused the anger of the local people. The local people immediately cooperated with the public security organs to launch a strict search for the Chiang bandit agents who had parachuted down.
