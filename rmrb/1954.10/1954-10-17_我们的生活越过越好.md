    Our Life is Getting Better and Better
    Huang Rongchang, Representative of the National People's Congress, Special-Class Industrial Labor Model of Chongqing City

    Now, our lives are getting better and better. Compared to the past, it's like comparing heaven to hell.

    I grew up in a poor peasant family in a village in Fuling County, Sichuan Province. When I was little, I ate tree leaves, grass roots, and "Guanyin clay." When I was ten, there was a drought, and the crops didn't yield well. My father sold firewood to try and pay the landlord's rent, but it wasn't enough. The whole family was forced to flee the famine. My mother died of illness on the road. My father went to the county town and gave my three-year-old brother away, but he couldn't find a way to make a living either. He passed away two years later. Later, my brother-in-law sent me to learn to be a sculptor. At sixteen, I learned carpentry, enduring beatings and scolding, not getting enough to eat, and not having enough to wear. At eighteen, I went to Chongqing City to do odd jobs, often unable to find work for several days, and life was very difficult. Sometimes, I was lucky enough to get a temporary job for two or three months, but because prices were rising every day, there was still no guarantee of a livelihood.

    In the winter of 1949, Chongqing was liberated, and I was really happy. Soon after, I went to the unemployment registration office run by the Municipal People's Government to register. In October 1950, I was admitted to Factory 101 as a carpenter. As soon as I entered the factory, before I even started working, I bought rice and brand-new cotton clothes on an installment plan. At that time, I thought, my parents lived their whole lives without ever wearing cotton clothes! My job was stable, and I didn't have to worry about food or clothing, but it's a pity my parents didn't live to see this day.

    The Party educated me: Even happier lives are ahead, and even happier lives depend on the joint creation of the people of the whole country. The Party also educated me that we are the masters of the factory, the masters of the country, and we should work like masters. So, I always thought that I should work hard. Other workshops in the factory used machines for production, and we also saw Soviet carpenters working happily with machines in Soviet films. I began to figure out how to use machines to replace heavy manual labor. With the support of the Party and the administration, and the joint efforts of my comrades, our carpentry workshop is now fully mechanized. On July 1, 1952, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, laid with steel rails produced by our factory, was opened to traffic. This was the first time in Chinese history that roads were paved with rails made by ourselves.

    With the development of production, the lives of our workers are getting better and better. In Factory 101, there are cooperatives, public canteens, schools, hospitals, reading rooms, cinemas, and theaters. The factory has also built rows of workers' dormitories, with post offices and banks, almost like a small city. Before liberation, many workers lived in thatched huts, and many workers still lived in dark and damp air-raid shelters. Now, workers are moving to new dormitories one after another. My wife and I also moved to No. 64 Jiefang Village.

    Before I entered the factory, I was illiterate. Later, I learned more than two thousand characters in the factory's spare-time cultural school. Now, after work, I often go to the reading room to read newspapers, magazines, picture albums, and comic books, which are also my favorite reading materials.

    In my family, besides my wife and I, there are two children. My eldest daughter is already three years old, and my youngest son has just turned one. On Sundays, I mostly study culture at home. Sometimes, we wear new clothes, dress up our little daughter beautifully, and go to the city. It's more than thirty li from the factory to the city. The Municipal People's Government built a wide highway, and the public bus runs extra shifts on Sundays, every few minutes, which is much more convenient than in the past.

    There are especially many people in the city on Sundays, including workers, cadres, students, and farmers from the suburbs. Department stores, cinemas, theaters, canteens, and restaurants are very crowded. We go to the department store to buy some things and have lunch in the cooperative restaurant. We wouldn't have dared to go into such a big restaurant before. We prefer to go to the Municipal Labor People's Cultural Palace, which was built by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Inside, you can watch ball games, watch "roller skating" (running on smooth ground wearing shoes with wheels), and stand outside the swimming pool to watch people swimming and diving performances. Or go to the zoo to teach children the names of various animals. The Cultural Palace also has cinemas, exhibition halls, and recreation rooms. When we are tired of playing, we sit on benches in the shade of the trees to rest, or go to the teahouse to drink tea. There is a Hall of Glory in the Cultural Palace, with oil portraits of labor models hanging on it, including mine. When I pass by there, I feel very ashamed. My contribution to the country is insignificant, but the Party and the people have given me very high honors. I can only do my best to do the things that the Party and the people expect and entrust to me. Let the socialist industrialization of our country be realized sooner, and let the people live better.

### 我们的生活越过越好

    我们的生活越过越好
    全国人民代表大会代表  重庆市特等工业劳动模范  黄荣昌
    现在，我们的日子越过越好，跟过去比，简直是拿天堂去比地狱。
    我生长在四川省涪陵县乡下一个贫苦农民的家里，小的时候吃过树叶、草根和“观音土”。我十岁那年天旱，庄稼收成不好，父亲打柴卖钱也还不清地主的地租，全家被迫逃荒；母亲病死在路上，父亲到县城把三岁的弟弟送给人家，也无法谋生。过了两年就去世了。后来，姐夫把我送去学雕刻匠。十六岁时又学木匠，挨打挨骂，吃不饱，穿不暖。十八岁时又跑到重庆市做零工，经常是好几天也找不到一件工作，生活非常困难。有时候，碰巧当两三个月的临时工，但是因为物价天天上涨，生活还是没有保障。
    一九四九年冬重庆解放了，我真高兴。不久，我就到市人民政府举办的失业工人登记处去登记。一九五零年十月，我考进了一零一厂当木工。我刚进厂，还没动手工作就按照分期付款的办法买了米，买了崭新的棉衣。当时我想，爸爸妈妈活了一辈子也没穿过棉衣啊！我的工作固定了，不愁吃，不愁穿，可惜爸爸妈妈都没有活到这一天。
    党教育我：更幸福的生活还在后头，更幸福的生活要靠全国人民共同来创造。党又教育我，我们是工厂的主人，是国家的主人，干活也应像主人一样。于是，我便时刻想着，应该好好工作才对。工厂里别的车间全用机器生产，我们也从苏联影片上看到苏联木工使用机器愉快地工作着。我开始琢磨怎样用机器代替笨重的手工操作，在党、行政的支持下和同志们的共同努力下，现在我们的木工房已经全部机械化了。一九五二年七月一日，用我们工厂生产的钢轨铺成的成渝铁路通车了。这是中国历史上第一次用自己制造的铁轨铺路。
    随着生产的发展，我们工人的生活越过越好了。在一零一厂里，有合作社、公共食堂、学校、医院、阅览室、电影院和剧院。工厂还修建了成排的工人宿舍，那里有邮局和银行，简直像个小城市。在解放前，很多工人住在茅草棚子里，很多工人还住在阴暗潮湿的防空洞里。现在，工人都陆续搬到新宿舍去了。我和我的妻子也搬到新建的解放村六十四号去了。
    我进厂以前是个文盲，后来在工厂业余文化学校认识了两千多个字。现在，下班后，我常到阅览室看报纸、杂志、画报和连环画也是我最爱好的读物。
    我的家里，除我和妻子而外，还有两个娃娃。大女儿已经三岁，小儿子刚满一岁，星期天，我多半在家中学文化。有时候，我们穿着新衣服，给小女儿也打扮得漂漂亮亮的，到市区去。由工厂到市区三十多里，市人民政府修了一条宽阔的公路，公共汽车星期天加班车，几分钟一趟，比过去方便多了。
    星期天市区的人特别多，有工人、干部、学生和由郊区来的农民。百货公司、电影院、戏院、食堂、饭馆都很拥挤。我们到百货商店买些东西，在合作社餐厅吃午饭。这样大的饭馆，以前我们是不敢进去的。我们更喜欢到市劳动人民文化宫去，它是市工会联合会修建的。里面可以看球赛，看“溜水”（是穿着带轮子的鞋，在平滑的地上跑的），站在游泳池栏杆外边看人们游泳和跳水表演。或者到动物园，教娃娃认识各种动物的名称。文化宫也有电影院、陈列馆和游艺室。我们玩累了，就坐在树荫边的凳子上休息，或者到茶馆内吃茶。文化宫里有光荣台，上面挂着劳动模范们的油彩画像，其中也有我的。当我走过那里时，心中很惭愧，我对国家的贡献是微不足道的，但党和人民却给了我很高的荣誉。我只有尽我的一切努力，作好党和人民期望和委托给我的事。让我们国家的社会主义工业化早些实现，让人民的生活过得更好。
