    Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation
　  Zhang Lan
    The People's Republic of China is five years old, and the people of the whole country are jubilantly welcoming this most memorable and celebrated great festival.
    This year's National Day marks our country's more victorious advance towards the goal of socialism. For five years, our people's democratic state, led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, uniting all democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and ethnic groups, has made extremely brilliant achievements in politics, economy, and culture. Based on these achievements, the First Session of the First National People's Congress was convened, solemnly passing the first people's constitution in our country's history, and electing new national leadership personnel. In this way, our people's democratic system will be further consolidated and strengthened, our economic construction will develop more rapidly, and our people's lives will gradually improve with economic development, thus enabling the masses to more fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity, providing a victorious guarantee for building our country into a prosperous and happy socialist society. The people of the whole country feel glorious and excited for our increasingly prosperous motherland!
    This year's National Day marks our country's greater contribution to further easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. Our country has established an unbreakable friendship with the great Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and the friendship between our people and the peace-loving people of the world is also growing. Our country's policy of establishing and developing diplomatic relations with any country based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty has achieved great success. At present, twenty-five countries have established or are establishing diplomatic relations with our country, and transactional relations have occurred with other countries. Today, thousands of foreign friends from all over the world are participating in our National Day celebrations. Our people are very willing to further develop friendship with the people of various countries through these respected friends. Our peace-loving country's active role in international affairs has been recognized by the world. We, together with the peace-loving people of the world headed by the Soviet Union, have facilitated the armistice in Indochina, allowing peace to triumph over war once again; at the same time, we have pointed out the path of peaceful coexistence for countries with different social systems, proving that any international dispute can be resolved through consultation. The diplomatic principles put forward by our country—mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence—have won the unanimous praise and trust of peace-loving people all over the world. In the future, with the development of our country, our peaceful foreign policy will further increase mutual understanding among countries and promote international cooperation.
    When we are filled with the joy of victory and point out brilliant achievements, we should naturally not forget that there are still long roads ahead and twists and turns and difficulties. In order to build our country into a new industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture and to safeguard world peace, we cannot have the slightest complacency. The people of the whole country must be more strongly united around the Chinese Communist Party, work together with one heart and one mind, pool our wisdom and efforts, and continue to work hard.
    Now, the constitution, which conforms to the common aspirations of the broad masses of the people of our country, has been promulgated, and our people have a guide to move towards a socialist society and a guarantee for building a socialist society. We must make every effort to realize every word of this fundamental law of the country. First of all, we must universally launch publicity and study of the constitution throughout the country, striving to make it known to every household. All state organ workers must set an example and consciously and strictly abide by the constitution and all other laws. The people of the whole country should, without exception, abide by the constitution and put it into practice. We must at all times measure and check our work with the socialist spirit of the constitution in order to achieve our lofty goal of building a socialist country.
    In addition, when the people of the whole country are jubilantly celebrating the great festival of the motherland, we must not forget for a moment the compatriots in Taiwan who are in dire straits. They are still under the fascist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. American imperialism has occupied our sacred territory and vainly attempts to use Taiwan as a springboard to restore the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in our country, which we absolutely cannot tolerate. Liberating Taiwan, completing the complete unification of our country, and rescuing Taiwan compatriots from the abyss of suffering is our people's inescapable responsibility. In order to safeguard the security of the motherland and defend world peace, the people of the whole country must liberate Taiwan; we will never stop until we achieve our goal!
    Our cause is just, and a just cause cannot be broken by any enemy. Let us follow the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, work diligently to build a socialist country, and strive to liberate Taiwan and defend the cause of peace in the Far East and the world!

    庆祝建国五周年
　  张澜
    中华人民共和国成立五周年了，全国人民都欢欣鼓舞地迎接着这个最值得纪念和庆祝的伟大节日。
    今年的国庆节，标志着我国将更胜利地向着社会主义的目标前进。五年以来，我们这个工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，团结各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和各族人民共同努力，在政治、经济、文化各方面，都获得了极其辉煌的成就，在这些成就的基础上，召开了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，庄严地通过了我国有史以来的第一个人民的宪法，并选举了新的国家领导工作人员。这样，我国人民民主制度就会更进一步的巩固和加强，我国的经济建设就会更迅速的往前发展，我国人民生活就会随着经济的发展逐步改善，因而使人民群众更能充分地发挥积极性和创造性，为我国建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会提供了胜利的保证。全国人民都为我们这个日益昌盛的祖国感觉光荣和兴奋！
    今年的国庆节标志着我国将在进一步缓和国际紧张局势和保障世界和平上，作出更多的贡献。我国同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家已建立了牢不可破的友谊，我国人民同全世界爱好和平的人民的友谊也日见增进。我国根据平等、互利、互相尊重领土主权的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系的政策，已获得了很大的成就。现在和我国已建立或正在建立外交关系的已有二十五国，且同另外一些国家发生了事务性的关系。今天，有成千的、来自全世界的外国朋友参加我国的国庆观礼，我国人民十分愿意通过这些尊敬的朋友进一步发展同各国人民之间的友谊。酷爱和平的我国在国际事务中所起的积极作用，已为世界所公认。我们和以苏联为首的全世界爱好和平的人民一道促成了印度支那的停战，使和平又一次战胜了战争；同时给不同社会制度的各国指出了和平共处的道路，证明以协商方式可以解决任何国际争端。我国所提出的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的外交原则，已博得全世界爱好和平人民的同声称赞和信赖。今后随着我们国家的发展，我们的和平外交政策将更会增加各国的互相了解，增进国际间的合作。
    当我们充满胜利的喜悦指出辉煌成就的时候，自然不应该忘记我们面前还有遥远的道路，还有曲折和困难。为了把我国建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的新国家和维护世界和平，我们不能有丝毫的骄傲自满，全国人民必须更坚强地团结在中国共产党的周围，同心同德，群策群力，继续努力。
  　现在，符合我国广大人民的共同愿望的宪法已经颁布了，我国人民已有了走向社会主义社会的指针和建成社会主义社会的保证。对于这个作为国家根本大法的一字一句，我们都要尽一切努力促其实现。首先必须在全国范围内普遍展开关于宪法的宣传、学习，务求做到家喻户晓。一切国家机关工作人员必须以身作则，自觉地严格地遵守宪法和其他一切法律。全国人民都应该毫无例外地遵守宪法，身体力行。我们必须随时以宪法的社会主义精神来衡量和检查我们的工作，才能达到我们建设社会主义国家的崇高的目的。
    此外，当我们全国人民欢欣鼓舞庆祝祖国伟大节日的时候，我们一刻也不能忘记处在水深火热中的台湾同胞，他们至今仍在蒋介石卖国集团的法西斯统治下，美帝国主义侵占了我国神圣的领土，且妄想以台湾为跳板来使蒋介石卖国集团的反动统治在我国复辟，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。解放台湾完成我全国的完全统一，拯救台湾同胞于水火之中，是我国人民责无旁贷的责任。为了保障祖国安全，保卫世界和平，全国人民一定要解放台湾；不达目的，决不休止！
    我们的事业是正义的，正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的，让我们遵循着中国共产党和毛主席的指示，勤勤恳恳地为建成社会主义国家而奋斗，为解放台湾、保卫远东和世界和平事业而奋斗！
