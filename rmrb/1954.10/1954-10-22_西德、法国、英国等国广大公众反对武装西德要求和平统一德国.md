    The General Public in West Germany, France, Britain, and Other Countries
    Opposes Arming West Germany and Demands Peaceful Reunification of Germany
    West Germany
    Recently, West German workers and trade union organizations, while striving to improve their living conditions, have widely launched a struggle against the remilitarization of West Germany, thereby promoting the West German trade union movement.
    On October 17, fifteen thousand young miners from the Ruhr region held a rally demanding the formulation of new regulations and improvement of labor insurance. They also opposed the remilitarization of West Germany and opposed conscription. Their slogans were: "Strive for understanding between young people in East and West Germany," "Young people want labor insurance regulations, not conscription laws."
    The strong anti-militarization sentiment of these fifteen thousand young miners is further evidence that the broad masses of West German workers are rising up against militarization recently.
    As early as late September, the Third Youth Congress of the West German Trade Union Federation passed a resolution protesting against remilitarization, protesting against the establishment of a West German army and the implementation of compulsory military service. Three hundred representatives attended this meeting, representing 600,000 young workers under the age of twenty-five.
    In recent weeks, some West German trade unions, such as the Metalworkers' Union, the Food Workers' Union, the Printing and Paper Workers' Union, the Employees' Union, and representatives of unemployed workers in West Berlin, have held meetings one after another, expressing their opposition to the revival of the German Wehrmacht, advocating peace, and advocating German unification.
    It is worth noting the Third Congress of the West German Trade Union Federation held in Frankfurt on October 4. The characteristic of this meeting was that the right-wing trade union leaders originally attempted to use this meeting as a platform for fascist propaganda, but they were met with opposition from a large number of representatives in the middle. In the resolutions proposed by one-third of the congress members, i.e., 150 delegations, included the following demands: the trade union should adopt a militant action program to oppose militarization and universal conscription, strive to increase wages, and strive to cooperate with the trade union organizations of the German Democratic Republic. Taking into account the will of the broad working people, the Congress finally passed a resolution on the 9th with a majority vote, condemning the London Agreement and demanding consultation on the unification of Germany.
    The above-mentioned development of the West German labor movement is an important event in the current West German politics. Helbig, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Free German Trade Union Federation, pointed out when talking about the resolution of the West German Trade Union Federation Congress that "this Congress is the most important event in the history of the German trade union movement," which will give new impetus to the trade union work in West Germany and will form a basis for new masses to participate in the national struggle.
      France
    Faced with the Western diplomats' stepped-up activities to militarize West Germany, the scale of the French people's struggle against arming West Germany is expanding. Factories, enterprises, urban districts, trade unions, and other social organizations have elected delegations to express to the participants of the upcoming Paris negotiations the unwavering determination of the French people to thwart the attempts of German revanchists.
    According to democratic newspapers, the railway workers of Dijon, the teachers of Auvergnat in the Ain province, all the members of the Toulon City Council, and all the residents of Grésy-sur-Isère in the Savoie province oppose arming West Germany and oppose allowing West Germany to join the Brussels Treaty and the North Atlantic Treaty.
    French National Assembly member André Denis, in a debate on French foreign policy at the Paris District Committee Congress of the "Jeune République" party, which opened in Paris on October 18, emphasized that the London resolutions to arm West Germany are intensifying the "Cold War."
      The Seine Provincial Committee of the "National Alliance of Independents, Peasants, and Republicans" issued a resolution demanding that the Mendès-France government pursue a truly nationally independent policy, take the Anglo-French general disarmament plan as the basis of the government's foreign policy, and demand that the government resume negotiations with the Soviet Union before agreeing to revive the (German) Wehrmacht.
    Britain
    British Labour Party MPs Brockway, Davies and Swingler have written to all Labour MPs in the House of Commons advocating a four-power conference to discuss the German question.
    The letter mentioned that the German Social Democratic Party in West Germany and some Socialist members in France opposed the London agreement to arm West Germany, and pointed out that the Soviet statement on endorsing the British proposal and other proposals for discussing free elections throughout Germany opens a path for "the four countries to resume negotiations on the German question and European security issues." The letter said: "It is important that an agreement be reached on the issue of free elections and the restoration of German unification, which is a realistic possibility at present."
    British Labour MP Richard Crossman spoke out against arming West Germany in Pontypridd, Wales, on the 17th, and particularly opposed the British government's promise at the London Nine-Power Conference to keep four divisions of British troops stationed in Europe in order to arm West Germany. He said: "If keeping British troops permanently stationed in Europe is the only way to prevent the revival of German militarism, then I am willing to let British troops be permanently stationed in Europe; however, keeping 120,000 troops there as the price of reviving German militarism is indeed utter foolishness."
    He added that more and more Labour Party members "have gradually realized that rearming West Germany does not mean reducing British defense spending and shortening the duration of military service, but means exactly the opposite."

### 西德、法国、英国等国广大公众反对武装西德要求和平统一德国

    西德、法国、英国等国广大公众
    反对武装西德要求和平统一德国
    西德
    最近以来，西德工人和工会组织在争取改善生活条件的同时，广泛展开了反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争，因而推进了西德的工会运动。
    十月十七日，一万五千名鲁尔区的青年矿工举行集会，要求制订新的条例，改进劳动保险。他们同时也反对西德重新军国主义化，反对征兵。他们的口号是：“争取东西德青年之间的谅解”，“青年们要劳动保险条例，不要征兵法令”。
    这一万五千名青年矿工的强烈的反军国主义化情绪，是最近以来西德广大职工起来反对军国主义化的又一明证。
    早在九月下旬，西德工会联合会的第三届青年代表大会就通过决议，抗议重新军国主义化，抗议建立一支西德军队和实行强迫兵役制。有三百个代表出席了这一次会议，他们代表着六十万不满二十五岁的青年工人。
    在最近几个星期中，西德的一些工会如五金工人工会、食品工人工会、印刷和纸张工人工会、职员工会、以及西柏林失业工人代表等都纷纷举行会议，表示反对复活德国国防军，主张和平，主张德国统一。
    值得注意的是十月四日在法兰克福举行的西德工会联合会第三次代表大会。这次会议的特点是：右翼工会领导人原来企图把这次会议作为法西斯宣传的讲坛，但是，却遇到了代表中间很大一部分人的反对。在代表大会成员的三分之一，即一百五十个代表团所提出的决议案中都包含了这样的要求：工会应该采取战斗的行动纲领，反对军国主义化和普遍兵役制，争取提高工资，争取同德意志民主共和国工会组织合作。代表大会考虑到广泛的劳动人民的意志，终于在九日以大多数票通过了指责伦敦协议、要求协商统一德国的决议。
    西德职工运动的上述发展，是当前西德政治中的重要事件。自由德国工会联合会中央书记处书记赫尔比希在谈到西德工会联合会代表大会的决议时指出，“这个代表大会是德国工会运动史上的一件最重要的事件”，它将给西德的工会工作以新的动力，并且将形成一个使新的群众参加民族斗争的基础。
      法国
    面对着西方外交官加紧西德军国主义化的活动，法国人民反对武装西德的斗争规模日益扩大。工厂企业、城市各区、工会和其他社团都选出了代表团，去向即将举行的巴黎谈判的参加者表明法国人民要挫败武装德国复仇主义者的企图的不屈不挠的决心。
    据民主报纸报道，反对武装西德和反对让西德加入布鲁塞尔条约和北大西洋公约的，有第戎的铁路工人，瑷茵省奥瑷云纳市的教师，土伦市议会的全体议员和萨瓦省格瑞齐—许尔—伊塞尔的全体居民。
    法国国民议会议员安·德尼在十月十八日在巴黎开幕的“青年共和”党巴黎区委员会代表大会关于法国外交政策的辩论中着重指出，武装西德的伦敦决议正在使“冷战”加剧。
      “独立者、农民与共和分子全国联盟”塞纳省委员会发表了一个决议，要求孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府奉行真正的民族独立的政策，以英法普遍裁减军备计划作为政府外交政策的基础，并要求政府在同意复活（德国）国防军以前先恢复和苏联的谈判。
    英国
    英国工党议员布罗克威、戴维斯和斯文勒等写信给下院的所有工党议员，主张召开四大国会议讨论德国问题。
    这封信提到西德的德国社会民主党和法国的一部分社会党员都反对武装西德的伦敦协定，并且指出：苏联关于赞成讨论在全德举行自由选举的英国建议和其他建议的声明，为“四国恢复关于德国问题和欧洲安全问题的谈判”打开了一条路。这封信说：“重要的是：就自由选举和恢复德国统一的问题达成协议，在目前是一种现实的可能。”
    英国工党议员理查德·克罗斯曼十七日在威尔士的彭特普列德发言反对武装西德，特别反对英国为了要武装西德而在伦敦九国会议上答应把四师英国军队留驻欧洲的作法。他说：“如果使英国军队永远留驻欧洲是防止德国军国主义复活的唯一办法，那我就愿意让英国军队永远留驻欧洲；但是，使十二万部队驻在那里作为复活德国军国主义的代价，那就的确是彻头彻尾的愚蠢行为。”
    他又说，越来越多的工党人士“已经逐渐认识到：重新武装西德不是意味着削减英国的防务费用和缩短兵役期限，而是意味着恰恰相反的东西”。
