As soon as the state's order for planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth was transmitted to the privately owned Ruifuxiang Cloth Store in Beijing, all of our employees were extremely excited and expressed their firm support for this order with practical actions. On the evening of September 13th, we accepted the glorious task assigned by the state – to count and check the cotton cloth inventory of Ruifuxiang Cloth Store. Because we realized that doing this work well was an important step in earnestly implementing the order for unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth, all employees immediately devoted themselves to intense labor. During the work, although the trade union repeatedly mobilized the elderly and weak employees to rest earlier, no one wanted to put down their work. Communist Party member Duan Zhenfu, who had only been working half days recently due to poor health, worked continuously for two days and one night, just like everyone else. Liu Tong, a 63-year-old worker, said, "For the early realization of a socialist society, I feel more energetic the more I work!" Thanks to the concerted efforts of all employee comrades, the counting, checking, packing, and registration of more than 730,000 feet of cotton cloth were completed in just one night. Under normal circumstances, it would take at least two days to complete these tasks. Because we completed the counting, checking, and classification and registration of cotton cloth on time, we ensured normal supply on September 14th.

The order for unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth stipulates that private cotton cloth retailers should be changed into state-owned agency stores or distribution stores. This is a bright road pointed out by the state for cotton cloth retailers and has won the support of the majority of private cotton cloth merchants. They have expressed their willingness to work hard to correct their business style, accept socialist transformation, and do a good job in cotton cloth agency and distribution business. However, a few capitalists who do not understand the overall situation have taken the opposite attitude. For example, on the day the order for unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth was announced (September 14th), some capitalists openly and unreasonably announced a day off for workers; some capitalists declared to workers that "anyone can borrow from the till," plotting to entice workers to rush to buy cotton cloth and sabotage the government's decree on unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth. Some capitalists in cotton cloth retail stores attempted to use the means of increasing wages to provoke the relationship between workers and the government. All of this reflects the ugly face of capitalists resisting socialist transformation. We must heighten our vigilance, raise our socialist consciousness, unite all employees and shop assistants, resolutely and ruthlessly expose their illegal facts, and supervise and help capitalists accept socialist transformation.

At the same time, we must also assist the capitalists in striving to improve business management and supervise them to earnestly do a good job in cotton cloth distribution and agency business. The transformation of private cotton cloth retailers from private capitalist enterprises to state capitalist enterprises according to the needs of the state is a step forward; however, the capitalist corruption and backwardness are fully exposed in the process of transforming it. Taking Ruifuxiang Cloth Store as an example, in July 1954, the expenditure of various operating expenses exceeded 25.5 percent of the gross profit; in August, the expenditure of various operating expenses actually exceeded 41.8 percent of the gross profit. To change this corrupt situation, of course, there are many difficulties and it needs to be carried out gradually, but if this corrupt situation is not changed, it will be impossible to adapt to the needs of the state. Therefore, we must, on the one hand, assist and urge the capitalists to vigorously improve business management so that it can serve the people. On the other hand, we must supervise the capitalists to abide by the distribution contract, implement the unified price policy for cotton cloth, and do a good job in distribution.

During the transitional period, workers and staff members in our stores shoulder a major task for the socialist transformation of private commerce. After systematically studying the general task of the state during the transitional period, the influence of bourgeois ideology has been continuously criticized, and the socialist consciousness of workers and staff members has been improved to some extent. Most workers and staff members have a relatively correct understanding of the consistency between individual interests and national interests, but a few workers and staff members are still deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology and are often unable to resist the material enticements of capitalists. Therefore, some erroneous understandings still exist regarding the consistency between individual interests and national interests. This requires us to continue to work hard, improve our socialist consciousness, heighten our vigilance, prevent the corrosion of bourgeois ideology, and complete the major historical task undertaken by the workers and staff members of stores during the transitional period of the state.

    监督和帮助资方，做好棉布经销工作
    北京市私营瑞蚨祥布店工会主席  高肇文
    当国家实行棉布计划收购和计划供应的命令传到北京市私营瑞蚨祥布店的时候，我们全体店员兴奋极了，大家表示坚决以实际行动拥护这项命令。九月十三日晚，我们接受了国家交给的光荣任务——对瑞蚨祥布店的棉布库存进行清点盘查，因为我们认识到做好这项工作，是认真贯彻棉布统购统销命令的重要步骤，所以，全体职工立即投入了紧张的劳动。在工作中，工会虽然再三动员年老体弱的职工早点休息，可是谁也不愿把工作放下。共产党员段振富因身体不好近来只工作半日，这时也和大家一样地连续工作了两天一夜。六十三岁的老年工人刘通说：“为了社会主义社会早日实现，真是越干越有劲！”由于全体店员同志的一致努力，仅仅一个夜晚就完成了七十三万多尺棉布的清点、盘查、整装、登记工作。在平时，做完这些工作至少需要两天的时间。由于我们按时完成了棉布的清点盘查和分类登记工作，保证了九月十四日的正常供应。
    棉布统购统销命令规定把私营棉布零售商改为国家的代销店或经销店，这是国家给棉布零售商指出的一条光明大道，因而获得了大多数私营棉布商人的拥护，他们表示要努力端正经营作风，接受社会主义改造，做好棉布代销、经销业务。但也有少数不明大义的资本家却采取了与此相反的态度，比如在棉布统购统销命令公布的那一天（九月十四日），有的资本家竟公然无缘无故地向工人宣布放假一天；有的资本家则向工人声明“谁用钱柜上可以借”，阴谋引诱工人去抢购棉布，破坏政府棉布统购统销的法令。有些棉布零售店的资本家企图用增加工资的手段来挑拨工人和政府的关系。所有这一切，都反映了资本家抗拒社会主义改造的丑恶面目。我们必须提高警惕，提高社会主义觉悟，团结全体职工店员，坚决无情地揭发他们的违法事实，监督和帮助资本家接受社会主义改造。
    同时，我们还必须协助资方努力改善经营管理，监督资方认真做好棉布经销代销工作。私营棉布零售商根据国家的需要，由私人资本主义企业转变为国家资本主义企业，这是一个进步；但资本主义腐朽性和落后性，在对它进行改造的过程中，却完全暴露出来，就拿瑞蚨祥布店来说，在一九五四年七月，各项经营费用支出超过毛利所得百分之二十五点五，八月，各项经营费用支出竟超过毛利所得百分之四十一点八。要改变这种腐朽的状况，当然有很多困难，也需要逐步进行，但如果不改变这种腐朽的状况，它就不可能适应国家的需要。因此，我们必须一方面协助并督促资方大力改善经营管理，使它能够为人民服务。另一方面，监督资方遵守经销合同，执行棉布统一价格政策，做好经销工作。
    国家在过渡时期对私营商业的社会主义改造，我们店员工人担负着重大的任务。经过系统的学习了国家在过渡时期的总任务以后，资产阶级思想的影响不断受到批判，职工店员的社会主义觉悟已有所提高，大部分职工店员对个人利益和国家利益的一致性有了比较正确的认识，但也有少数职工店员由于受资产阶级思想影响较深，还常常经不起资本家的物质引诱，因而对个人利益和国家利益的一致性还存在着一些错误认识。这就需要我们大家继续努力，提高社会主义觉悟，提高警惕，防止资产阶级思想的腐蚀，来完成店员工人在国家过渡时期所担负着的重大的历史任务。
