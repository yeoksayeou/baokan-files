    Shandong Provincial Department of Education Holds Symposium on Elementary School Labor Education
    The Shandong Provincial People's Government Department of Education held a symposium on elementary school labor education from the 10th to the 14th. Participants included heads of cultural and educational departments from various special districts and cities in the province, as well as some elementary school principals.
    The meeting summarized the situation of labor education for elementary school students since the spring of this year. Since the beginning of the spring semester, schools in various parts of Shandong Province have further strengthened labor education for students in many ways through reports, speeches, and other methods, as well as through various subject teachings and extracurricular activities. The erroneous ideas of elementary school students, especially sixth-grade graduates, who one-sidedly pursue higher education and despise labor production, have undergone some changes. The vast majority of primary and junior primary school graduates who did not continue their education this year have happily participated in labor production. In Gaomi County, more than 4,600 primary and junior primary school graduates who did not continue their education this year have joined mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and they have played a significant role in consolidating and developing mutual aid cooperation and improving agricultural production. Many primary and junior primary school graduates also actively participate in self-study groups, spare-time study classes, youth study rooms, and Sunday schools to study, preparing to participate in labor production in the future. In Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai alone, more than 13,000 people are participating in cultural refresher schools; in the Wendeng Special District, more than 39,000 students have been organized for self-study. Due to the strengthening of labor education in classroom teaching and extracurricular activities, students have further established correct labor viewpoints and developed labor habits. Many high-grade students in schools have opened up their own campuses and planted flowers and trees; some schools have also established crafts, sewing, and gardening groups to carry out after-school labor assignments; older students often help their families with odd jobs.
    During the meeting, some educational administrative departments were criticized for their weak leadership in labor education, and many teachers were criticized for their erroneous idea that labor education is a means of mobilizing students to participate in labor production, without realizing that labor education is an important part of communist education. The meeting believes that in order to more comprehensively implement labor education, it is necessary to further improve teachers' socialist awareness, so that teachers can clearly understand that elementary school is the basic education of the people, and further correctly understand the purpose and significance of labor education; it is necessary to conduct labor education for students in a comprehensive, meticulous, and in-depth manner through classroom teaching and extracurricular activities; education administrative departments should strengthen leadership in this area and promptly solve problems in labor education.

    山东省教育厅召开小学劳动教育座谈会
    山东省人民政府教育厅在十日到十四日举行小学劳动教育座谈会。参加座谈会的有全省各专区、市文教部门负责人及部分小学校长等。
    会上总结了今年春季以来对小学学生进行劳动教育的情况。从今年春季开学起，山东省各地学校都以作报告、讲演等方式，并通过各科教学和课外活动，从多方面向学生进一步加强劳动教育。小学生特别是六年级应届毕业生的片面追求升学和轻视劳动生产的错误思想已经有了一定的转变。今年没有升学的高小和初小毕业生，绝大部分都愉快地参加了劳动生产。高密县全县今年没有升学的高小和初小毕业生已有四千六百多人参加了互助组和农业生产合作社，他们在巩固和发展互助合作、提高农业生产方面发挥了不少作用。许多高小和初小毕业生还积极参加了自学小组、业余学习班、青年学习室、星期学校等进行学习，准备将来参加劳动生产。仅济南、青岛、烟台三个城市参加文化补习学校学习的就有一万三千多人；文登专区组织起来自学的学生已达三万九千多人。由于在课堂教学和课外活动中加强了劳动教育，学生们都进一步树立了正确的劳动观点，养成了劳动的习惯。许多学校的高年级学生开辟了自己的校园，栽植了花树；有的学校并成立了工艺、缝纫、园艺等小组，进行课余劳动作业；年龄较大的学生还经常帮助家庭干零活。
    会议过程中，检查和批判了某些教育行政部门对劳动教育领导薄弱和许多教师认为劳动教育是动员学生参加劳动生产的手段，没有认识到劳动教育是共产主义教育的一个重要部分的错误思想。会议认为：为了更全面地贯彻劳动教育，今后要进一步提高教师的社会主义觉悟，使教师明确小学是人民的基础教育，进一步正确地认识劳动教育的目的和意义；必须通过课堂教学和课外活动，全面、细致、深入地对学生进行劳动教育；教育行政部门应加强这方面的领导，及时解决劳动教育中的问题。（新华社）
