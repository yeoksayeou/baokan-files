The early childhood education事业 of New China has greatly developed in the five years under the leadership of the Party and the government. According to incomplete statistics in 1953, there were more than 424,900 children in kindergartens across the country, an increase of 226.4% compared with the highest year (1946) during the Kuomintang rule before liberation. The fastest development has been in kindergartens in government agencies and factories. Before liberation, there were no kindergartens in reactionary government agencies. A few factories had kindergartens, but they served the factory directors and bosses, and the children of workers could not enter. Now, our government agencies have universally established kindergartens. Factory kindergartens have also developed rapidly with the development of industrial construction. Many newly built factories and worker residential areas have allocated a certain area to build kindergartens. In the vast rural areas, kindergartens and nurseries run by the masses of farmers have also developed. The development of early childhood education ensures that women in our country can participate more widely in various production activities and various social and political activities, and lays the foundation for the communist education of children.

In the past five years, early childhood educators in New China have made arduous efforts to implement comprehensive development education in kindergartens. The old kindergartens serving the bourgeoisie before liberation did not have a unified education system and teaching syllabus, and basically spread the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie; early childhood education workers were deeply influenced by the worship of the United States, thinking that everything was better in the United States. All teaching methods, teaching aids, stories, and songs were learned from the United States, and even the clay used for clay modeling had to be American. After liberation, on the basis of ideological remolding of early childhood education workers, in the process of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, this comprador and bourgeois educational viewpoint was criticized, and communist educational thought is gradually being established. In 1952, with the help of Soviet experts, a kindergarten teaching syllabus was formulated, abolishing the unit teaching based on the liberal education thought of child-centeredness. It stipulated a comprehensive development of early childhood education, with physical education as the primary task, while also emphasizing the cultivation of intellectual, moral, and aesthetic education, emphasizing collectivist education, labor education, and the friendship of children of all nationalities, as well as education in loving the motherland and leaders. The new early childhood education emphasizes the development of children's language and thinking, pays attention to broadening children's horizons, and clearly stipulates that games are the leading activity in kindergartens. In addition, it clearly defines the leading role of caregivers in education and teaching, strengthens their sense of responsibility, and corrects the past tendency of liberal education. At present, most kindergartens have achieved cleanliness, order, adherence to the work and rest system, and outdoor activities. Children's games and homework have rich life content. They undertake work suitable for their age, such as being on duty and taking care of animals and plants. These tasks cultivate their love of labor. They show a spirit of mutual assistance and love in their daily lives. They respect the elderly and the People's Liberation Army. Every child loves our great leader Chairman Mao. It can be seen that today's early childhood education has undergone essential changes compared with the old early childhood education before liberation. Early childhood education has been closely linked with the country's socialist construction事业.

New China has always respected and cared for caregivers. Before liberation, caregivers were hired by landlords and the bourgeoisie to take care of children, and they had no social status at all. They were inferior to parents, and they had to cater to powerful parents. Today, the profession of caregiver is a noble and glorious profession. Caregivers bear the important responsibility of cultivating a new generation for building communism. They are respected by society and families. In April 1952, Huang Shujun, a caregiver from Beijing Fensiting Kindergarten, attended the International Conference for the Defense of Children held in Vienna. In recent years, in the work of early childhood education, especially in the process of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, many outstanding caregivers have emerged. They have accumulated a lot of experience in education and teaching, and they have created many songs, stories, toys, teaching aids, and a variety of educational methods. They have dedicated all their energy to this noble cause.

The achievements of New China's early childhood education事业 are inseparable from the friendly assistance of Soviet experts. Since 1950, Soviet early childhood education experts Gorina and Manuilenko have come to our country one after another to train cadres for New China's early childhood education事业 and guide our practical work. They not only imparted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but also their unparalleled enthusiasm for early childhood education事业, their lofty communist qualities, and their spirit of not fearing difficulties have had a great impact on our early childhood education workers.

Although early childhood education has made many achievements, there are still many problems and difficulties.

First, the development of kindergartens. With the increasing development of national economic and cultural construction, more and more women are participating in production labor and social work, which urgently requires the development of kindergartens. However, the country is currently in a period of transition, and various construction事业 must be developed proportionally and in a planned manner. The country cannot massively and universally establish kindergartens to meet the needs of society. Therefore, to solve this problem at present, we must rely more on the masses. The government should cooperate with people's organizations to mobilize manpower and resources from various sources to develop kindergartens. In the future, the kindergarten should implement the policy of mainly self-run by factories, government agencies, groups, and the masses. Government departments should plan to run some kindergartens well so that they can play a certain demonstration role. The focus of kindergarten development should be on industrial areas and large and medium-sized cities. As for rural areas, according to the needs and the principle of voluntariness, it can be advocated that agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid groups run year-round or seasonal kindergartens. At present, various simple methods can still be used to run kindergartens. There is no need to emphasize unification too early, and there should not be excessive or excessive requirements, but we must clearly recognize that we should strive to run full-day kindergartens. In addition, it is also necessary to publicize to the society and parents to clarify the nature and tasks of kindergartens. Parents should not regard kindergartens as a primary school, thinking that children must enter kindergartens when they are three years old. This should be determined according to the actual needs of the parents.

Second, the issue of kindergarten teachers. Due to the poor foundation in the past and the rapid development now, the lack of teachers has become an extremely serious problem in our country's early childhood education事业. The serious lack of teachers affects the quality of education in kindergartens. In order to solve this problem, it is recommended that all localities, according to their needs and possibilities, establish independent early childhood normal schools where conditions permit; where there are no conditions, early childhood normal school classes can be set up in ordinary normal schools. In addition, efforts should be made to mobilize forces from all sides and adopt various forms of temporary transitional measures to train kindergarten teachers. At present, comrades who are in other jobs and who have studied or worked in early childhood education in the past should be mobilized to return to their posts as much as possible. At the same time, we must do a good job in the distribution of graduates from early childhood normal schools in the future, and they should not be used for jobs that are not related to their studies.

Third, the issue of kindergarten toys. Toys are important educational tools for early childhood education work. Toys can arouse children's interest in games, and can enrich and develop children's imagination. They are indispensable companions in children's lives. However, at present, there is no unified leadership in our country for the manufacturing, research, and review of toys; the number of toys manufactured is small, and the quality is low. Most of the toys still retain the semi-colonial characteristics left over from the past. For example, the faces of dolls are mostly foreign dolls, and it is difficult to find a few good-looking Chinese dolls; the rest, such as strange-shaped animals and funny people, are mostly imported styles, and our national-style folk toys have not been well developed. How to develop national forms in toy manufacturing and meet educational requirements is an urgent issue that needs to be jointly studied and resolved by our educational administrative departments, relevant social organizations, and toy manufacturing departments. As for kindergartens, caregivers should still be encouraged to create toys themselves. This can solve the problem of the lack of toys for children and meet the requirements of thrift. Some kindergartens have already done this and have achieved great results. We can organize observation and mutual learning to improve this work on the existing basis.

Fourth, the issue of kindergarten stories, poems and other teaching materials. Kindergartens now have a teaching syllabus, but there is still a lack of teaching materials suitable for children, such as stories, poems, and music, which makes most kindergartens use translated works, which greatly affects the development of children's language. We hope that literary and art workers will create some music, stories, and poems suitable for children, and we need to help and encourage caregivers to create their own works in a planned way. The more successful stories, nursery rhymes, music, and other works written by caregivers in their actual work should be collected, processed, and further improved in their ideological and artistic nature, and these works should be widely introduced.

There are many, many things to be done in early childhood education. Our early childhood educators should continue to work hard, work enthusiastically, earnestly learn from the advanced experience of Soviet early childhood education, overcome all difficulties, and gradually improve our early childhood education事业.

    幼儿教育工作的情况和问题
    张逸园
    五年来新中国的幼儿教育事业，在党和政府的领导下，有了很大的发展。据一九五三年不完全的统计，全国幼儿园的幼儿有四十二万四千九百多人，比解放前国民党统治时期最高年份（一九四六年）增加了百分之二百二十六点四。发展得最快的是机关、工厂的幼儿园。解放前，反动政府的机关没有幼儿园，少数工厂曾有幼儿园，但都是为厂长、老板们服务的，工人的子女进不去。现在，我们的机关，已经普遍地设立幼儿园。工厂的幼儿园随着工业建设的发展也有了迅速的发展，许多新建的工厂和工人住宅区，都划出了一定的面积来建筑幼儿园。在广大农村中，农民群众自办的幼儿园和托儿所，也发展起来。幼儿教育事业的发展，保证了我国妇女得以更广泛地参加各种生产活动，参加各种社会和政治活动，并为儿童的共产主义教育打下了基础。
    五年来，新中国的幼儿教育工作者为幼儿园实施全面发展的教育进行了艰巨的努力。解放前的旧的、为资产阶级服务的幼儿园，没有统一的教育制度和教学大纲，基本上是在传播着资产阶级的腐朽思想；幼儿教育工作人员沾染了很深的崇美思想，一切都是美国的好，举凡教学方法、教具、故事、唱歌，都学美国，甚至作泥工用的泥都要用美国的。解放后，在幼儿教育工作者经过思想改造的基础上，在学习苏联先进经验的过程中，批判了这种买办的、资产阶级的教育观点，并正在逐步树立共产主义的教育思想。一九五二年，在苏联专家帮助下，制订了幼儿园教学纲要，废除了以儿童为本位的自由主义教育思想为基础的单元教学，规定了全面发展的幼儿教育，以体育为首要任务，同时重视智育、德育和美育的培养，重视集体主义的教育、劳动教育和各民族儿童友好以及热爱祖国和领袖的教育。新的幼儿教育重视幼儿语言和思维的发展，注意扩大幼儿的眼界，并明确规定了游戏是幼儿园的主导活动。此外，明白地确定了教养员在教育、教学中的主导作用，加强了她们的责任感，纠正了过去自由主义教育的倾向。目前在多数幼儿园里做到了清洁，有秩序，遵守作息制度，并进行了户外活动。幼儿们的游戏和作业有着丰富的生活内容。他们担当着适合他们年龄的工作，如当值日生、照料动植物等，这些工作培养着他们爱劳动的品质。他们在日常生活中表现了互助、友爱的精神，他们尊敬年长的人，尊敬解放军，每一个孩子都热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席。可以看到，今天的幼儿教育和解放以前的旧的幼儿教育相比，已经起了本质的变化。幼儿教育已经同国家的社会主义建设事业紧密地联系起来了。
    新中国对教养员一贯是尊重和关怀的。解放前，教养员是给地主、资产阶级哄孩子的，根本没有什么社会地位。她们在家长面前矮一截，她们要逢迎有权势的家长。今天，教养员的职业是一个崇高而光荣的职业。教养员们担负着培育建设共产主义的新的一代的重大责任。她们受到社会和家庭的尊敬。一九五二年四月北京分司厅幼儿园教养员黄淑俊出席了在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童大会。最近几年来，在幼儿教育工作中，尤其是在学习苏联先进经验的过程中，涌现了许多优秀的教养员。她们在教育、教学等方面都积累了不少经验，她们创作了许多歌曲、故事，创造了许多玩具、教具以及多种多样的教育方法，她们把全部精力贡献给这一崇高的事业。
    新中国幼儿教育事业的成就是和苏联专家的友谊的帮助分不开的。从一九五○年开始，苏联幼儿教育专家戈林娜和玛弩依连柯先后来我国，为新中国的幼儿教育事业培养干部，并指导我们的实际工作。她们不仅传授了苏联的先进经验，同时她们对于幼儿教育事业的无比的热情，她们的共产主义的崇高品质，不怕困难的精神，都给我们的幼儿教育工作者很大的影响。
    幼儿教育虽然有不少的成就，但存在的问题和困难还很多。
    首先是幼儿园的发展问题。随着国家经济和文化建设的日益发展，参加生产劳动和社会工作的妇女也日益增多，这种情况迫切要求幼儿园的发展。但是，国家目前正处在过渡时期，各种建设事业必须按比例地有计划地发展，国家目前还不可能大量地普遍地设立幼儿园，来满足社会的需要。因此，当前解决这个问题，必须更好地依靠群众。政府要同人民团体互相配合，动员多方面的人力、物力来发展幼儿园。今后幼儿园应贯彻以工厂、机关、团体、群众自办为主的方针。政府部门则应有计划地办好一些幼儿园，使其能起一定的示范作用。幼儿园的发展重点应放在工业地区和大、中城市。至于农村，根据需要和自愿的原则，可以提倡农业生产合作社或互助组办理常年的或季节性的幼儿园。目前办理幼儿园，仍可采用多种多样的简便办法，不必过早强调统一，也不应有过高过多的要求，但必须明确认识，我们应当以办理整日制幼儿园为努力方向。另外，还需要向社会、向家长进行宣传，讲清幼儿园的性质和任务。使家长们不要把幼儿园看成是一级学校，认为幼儿到了三周岁，就一定要进幼儿园。这应当根据父母的实际需要来决定。
    第二、幼儿园的师资问题。我国的幼儿教育事业，由于过去基础差，现在发展快，因而师资的缺乏，就成了极严重的问题。师资严重缺乏，影响到幼儿园的教育工作质量。为了解决这一问题，建议各地根据需要和可能，凡是有条件设立独立幼儿师范的，即设立独立的幼儿师范；无条件的，可在普通师范内，设置幼儿师范班。此外，还应当动员各方面的力量，采取多种形式的临时过渡的办法，来培养幼儿园师资。目前在其他工作岗位的、过去学过或做过幼儿教育工作的同志，要尽量动员她们归队。同时，还必须做好今后幼儿师范毕业生的分配工作，不应使她们学非所用。
    第三、幼儿园的玩具问题。玩具是幼儿教育工作的重要的教育工具。玩具能引起儿童对游戏的兴趣，能丰富和发展幼儿的想像力，它是幼儿生活中不可缺少的伴侣。但目前我国对玩具的制造、研究和审查，尚无统一的领导；制造的玩具数量少，质量低。大多数玩具还保存着过去遗留下来的半殖民地的特点，如娃娃的脸形，多半是洋娃娃，很难找到几个好看的中国娃娃；其余如奇形怪状的动物和滑稽人等等，也大多是舶来品的式样，我国民族形式的民间玩具，没有很好的发展。在玩具制造方面，怎样发展民族形式，并符合于教育的要求，是急待我们教育行政部门、有关社会团体以及制造玩具的部门共同研究来解决的。至于在幼儿园中，仍应鼓励教养员自己创作玩具，这样既可解决幼儿们玩具缺乏的问题，也符合于节约要求。现在有些幼儿园已经这样做了，而且很有成绩，可以组织观摩，互相学习，使这一工作在已有的基础上提高一步。
    第四、幼儿园的故事、诗歌等教材问题。幼儿园现在已经有了教学纲要，但适合于幼儿的故事、诗歌、音乐等教材还很缺乏，致使大多数幼儿园采用翻译作品，这对于幼儿语言的发展，很受影响。我们希望文艺工作者为幼儿们创作一些适合于他们的音乐、故事和诗歌，我们更需要有计划地帮助和鼓励教养员们自己来创作。应当把教养员们在实际工作中自己写的比较成功的故事、儿歌、音乐等作品，搜集起来，进行加工，进一步提高它们的思想性艺术性，广泛地介绍这些作品。
    在幼儿教育方面，要做的事情还很多很多，我们幼儿教育工作者应当继续努力，热情地劳动，认真学习苏联幼儿教育的先进经验，克服一切困难，逐步提高我们的幼儿教育事业。
