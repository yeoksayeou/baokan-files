(Xinhua News Agency, 19th) According to Soviet newspapers: Collective farms and state farms throughout the Soviet Union have successively completed this year's autumn sowing and plowing plans ahead of schedule. The national state farms' winter crop sowing plan was completed by 115.4 percent on October 10th, which is 195,000 hectares more than the same period last year. The collective farms' winter crop sowing plan was also completed by 101.3 percent on October 10th. In the Russian Federation, the vast majority of collective farms sowed this year's winter crops within the best agricultural technical timeframe. Last year, the autumn sowing work of collective farms in the central, northwestern, and southeastern states and some regions of the Urals of the Republic did not end until October, but this year almost all winter crops were sown before the beginning of September. Collective farms in many states completed the sowing plan for winter grains ahead of schedule, and the sown area was greatly expanded compared with last year. Therefore, although the autumn sowing work in the southern region is still in progress, the autumn sowing plan of the entire Russian Federation collective farms was completed by 105 percent on October 5th. In the Ukrainian Republic, collective farms in various places had sown more than 10 million hectares of winter crops by October 7th, a large part of which was sown using advanced narrow-row sowing and cross-sowing methods. This year, the autumn sowing work of collective farms in Ukraine is also proceeding very quickly, and the autumn sowing work in the twelve northern states ended 10 to 15 days earlier than last year.
    This year's autumn plowing work in the Soviet Union is also better than last year. By October 1st, collective farms across the country had plowed 7,141,000 hectares more autumn fields than in the same period last year. Hundreds of tractor teams in the Chkalov Oblast of the Russian Federation participated in the socialist competition to carry out autumn plowing work in a timely manner, ensuring the early completion of the autumn plowing task.

    苏联提前完成今年秋播秋耕计划
    【新华社十九日讯】据苏联报纸消息：苏联各地集体农庄和国营农场相继提前完成今年的秋播和秋耕计划。全国国营农场冬季作物的播种计划到十月十日就完成了百分之一百一十五点四，比去年同期多播种了十九万五千公顷的冬季作物。集体农庄的冬季作物播种计划也在十月十日完成了百分之一百零一点三。在俄罗斯联邦，绝大多数集体农庄今年的冬季作物都是在最好的农业技术期限内播种的。去年，共和国的中部、西北部和东南部各州及乌拉尔某些地区的集体农庄的秋播工作到十月才结束，但今年几乎全部冬季作物在九月上旬以前就播种完毕了。许多州的集体农庄很早就超计划完成了冬季谷物的播种计划，而且播种面积比去年大大扩大了，因此，尽管南部地区的秋播工作仍在进行，但整个俄罗斯联邦集体农庄的秋播计划，在十月五日就完成了百分之一百零五。在乌克兰共和国，各地集体农庄到十月七日共播种了一千多万公顷冬季作物，其中有很大部分是用先进的窄行播种法和交叉播种法播种的。今年乌克兰集体农庄的秋播工作进行得也很快，北部十二个州的秋播工作比去年提前十天到十五天结束。
    苏联今年的秋耕工作也比去年进行得好。到十月一日，单是全国集体农庄就比去年同期多翻耕了七百一十四万一千公顷秋田。俄罗斯联邦契卡洛夫州有几百个拖拉机队参加了及时进行秋耕工作的社会主义竞赛，保证了秋耕任务的提前完成。
