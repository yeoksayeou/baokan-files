    Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang Provinces
    More Than 2,300 New Agricultural Production Cooperatives Established
    After the summer harvest, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang and other provinces have newly established more than 2,340 agricultural production cooperatives in conjunction with production, which is more than seven times the number last year.
    Agricultural production cooperatives pay great attention to improving cultivation techniques and tapping the potential of the land. The Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Huangfu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, took the lead in modifying old seed drills, changing the row spacing of the drill legs from the original eight inches to more than five inches, and implementing rational close planting in wheat fields. The Qiming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hancheng County repaired an 80-zhang-long canal and renovated five mu of paddy fields. The Baicaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengcheng County reclaimed 56 mu of wasteland, which can increase grain production by 28 shi. The Wanzi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tianshui, Gansu Province, built ridges on all 160 mu of mountainous land and dug 11 water storage ponds, greatly reducing flood disasters. In addition, agricultural production cooperatives have played a leading role in selling surplus grain and cotton, and expanding production. Under the leadership of the agricultural production cooperative, farmers in Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, sold more than 380,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, exceeding the planned figure by more than 80,000 jin. In August, after the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Shaanxi and other provinces successively issued instructions on overfulfilling this year's agricultural production plan, agricultural production cooperatives in various places attached importance to organizing members to study and discuss, and many cooperatives formulated plans to ensure excess production and paid attention to strengthening the management of autumn fields, which effectively motivated the surrounding farmers to strive for continued good harvests.
    The superiority displayed by the agricultural production cooperatives has further strengthened the members' confidence in running the cooperatives well and has effectively guided the surrounding farmers to take the socialist road. After the summer harvest, many mutual aid teams and farmers have requested to establish cooperatives or join cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics from 33 counties in Shaanxi and Gansu, more than 1,300 mutual aid teams have requested to transfer to cooperatives. Sixteen agricultural production cooperatives in Baoji Special District, Shaanxi Province, expanded from the original 228 households to 1,098 households, an increase of nearly four times. Since the beginning of autumn, more mutual aid teams and farmers have requested to transfer to or join cooperatives. In order to meet the needs of the masses of farmers for production development, Party committees at all levels have studied and proposed plans for developing agricultural production cooperatives that are in line with local conditions. According to preliminary plans of the provinces, by the autumn harvest of next year, these provinces can increase the total number of agricultural production cooperatives to nearly 20,000, with about 400,000 farmer households joining the cooperatives, that is, developing six to seven times more than now.

    陕西甘肃新疆三省
    新建农业生产合作社两千三百多个
    夏收后，陕西、甘肃、新疆等省结合生产新建立农业生产合作社二千三百四十多个，比去年增加了七倍多。
    农业生产合作社对改进耕作技术、发挥土地潜力都很注意。陕西大荔团结农业生产合作社、黄甫村农业生产合作社等带头改装旧耧，将耧腿由原来行距八寸改为五寸多，麦田实行了合理密植。韩城启明农业生产合作社，修了八十丈长的水渠，整修了五亩水地。澄城白草塬农业生产合作社开了五十六亩荒地，可增产二十八石粮食。甘肃天水湾子村农业生产合作社在一百六十多亩山地上，全部培了地埂，并挖了十一个涝池，大大减少了洪水灾害。此外，农业生产合作社在出卖余粮、棉花，扩大生产等方面，都起了带头作用。陕西米脂县农民在农业生产合作社的带动下，共卖给国家余粮三十八万多斤，超过计划数字八万多斤。八月间，当中共中央西北局和陕西等省相继发出关于超额完成今年农业生产计划的指示后，各地农业生产合作社都重视组织社员进行学习讨论，不少社并订出保证超额增产的计划，注意加强秋田管理等工作，有力地带动了周围农民争取继续丰收的积极性。
    农业生产合作社显示的优越性，进一步坚定了社员们办好合作社的信心，并有力地引导了周围的农民走社会主义道路。夏收后，很多互助组和农民纷纷要求办社或加入社。据陕西、甘肃三十三个县的不完全统计，要求转社的互助组就有一千三百多个。陕西省宝鸡专区十六个农业生产合作社由原来二百二十八户扩大到一千零九十八户，增加将近四倍。入秋以来，各地互助组和农民要求转社、入社者更多，为了适应农民群众生产发展的需要，各级党委都研究提出了切合当地情况的发展农业生产合作社的计划。据各省初步计划，到明年秋收前，这几省农业生产合作社共可增加到近两万个，入社农民约四十万多户，即比现在发展六、七倍。
