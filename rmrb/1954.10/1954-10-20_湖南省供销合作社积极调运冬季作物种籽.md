    In order to support the disaster-stricken farmers in the lake area to help themselves through production and to support farmers in hilly and mountainous areas to increase production beyond their quotas, the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative dispatched cadres to Sichuan, Henan, Jiangsu, Guangdong and other provinces to purchase miscellaneous grains and vegetable seeds.
    With the active support of the Party committees and governments of various provinces, the cooperative has now successfully completed the purchase of winter crop seeds. The first batch of 100,000 dan of seeds transported back has been successively transferred to various counties; the remaining seeds are expected to be transported back from other provinces and allocated to various counties successively in October.
    In this seed transportation work, the Supply Management Department of the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative specially set up a seed transportation office. When the department handled seed transportation work last time, due to the lack of a special organization to lead and the lack of necessary contact system, many chaotic phenomena occurred in the work, which delayed the transportation time and increased circulation costs. This time, the department set up a seed transportation office, so that seeds from various provinces can be quickly allocated at any time after they are transported, thus ensuring that these seeds can be supplied to farmers in time before the sowing season.

    湖南省供销合作社积极调运冬季作物种籽
    湖南省供销合作总社为了支持滨湖区受灾农民生产自救和丘陵区、山区农民超额增产，先后派出干部，分别到四川、河南、江苏、广东等省采购杂粮及蔬菜种籽。
    由于各省党委、政府积极支持，该社现已顺利完成了冬季作物种籽的采购工作。第一批运回的十万担种籽，已陆续调往各县；其余的种籽，预计可在十月份内陆续从省外运回并调拨到各县。
    在这次接运种籽的工作中，湖南省供销合作总社供应经理部专门设立了种籽接运办公室。该部上次办理种籽接运工作时，由于没有设立专门机构领导，同时缺少必要的联系制度，工作中出现了不少混乱现象，以致延缓了调运时间，增加了流转费用。该部这次设立了种籽接运办公室，各省的种籽运到以后，随时可以迅速下拨，因而保证了这些种籽可以在播种季节以前及时供应到农民手中。（本报湖南省记者站）
