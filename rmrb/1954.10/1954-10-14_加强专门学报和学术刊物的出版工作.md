Strengthen the Publication of Specialized Journals and Academic Periodicals
Na Ke

In modern scientific life, the publication of various specialized journals and academic collections occupies an important position. Scientific discoveries and inventions are often first published through journals and academic collections. Original reports and records of scientific research work are also recorded in journals and specialized collections. As everyone knows, in modern scientific work, a scholar who does not absorb the work done by his predecessors and does not refer to other people's scientific papers can hardly conduct research on any important scientific problems. A modern engineering designer who does not absorb the latest scientific achievements can hardly complete a truly modern and latest design. Therefore, various journals and academic collections have become indispensable reference materials for scientific workers and engineering experts. In addition to playing the role of disseminating scientific achievements and recording scientific data, various specialized journals and academic collections are also a forum for scientific workers to exchange ideas and conduct debates on different opinions, and are organizers and promoters of scientific research work. Experience has proven that if a specialized academic publication can be run vigorously, it can continuously provide scholars with new ideas, raise new questions, organize debates on different opinions, and stimulate and promote the development of research work.

It can be seen that strengthening the existing national specialized journals, academic collections and other publications published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various specialized societies of the All-China Federation of Natural Sciences, and publishing academic school journals independently or jointly by various universities, is of great significance for promoting the development of scientific research work.

Every science must have its own specialized journal. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies have jointly published 26 national specialized journals and academic collections. These publications have played a certain role in promoting academic development in our country. However, the vast majority of these publications belong to basic natural sciences, while journals in engineering sciences and social sciences are published very little. In engineering sciences, only a few such as mechanical engineering, civil engineering, chemical engineering, and architecture journals have been published so far; in social sciences, only a few such as Historical Research, Archaeological Journal, and the Third Collection of the Institute of History have been published.

Universities should also publish comprehensive or specialized academic publications. The publication of academic publications by universities independently or jointly has a great effect on promoting the scientific research work of teachers and other scientific personnel in universities, and is an effective method for tapping the potential strength of scientific research work in universities. Facts have proven that universities in our country are fully capable of publishing academic publications. Currently, ten universities have published academic school journals or publications that combine academic papers and articles guiding teaching work. Taking Xiamen University as an example, in the past two years, it has published three academic publications in the fields of literature and history, finance and economics, and biology and mathematics. Moreover, the content of the articles published in these three journals is also relatively substantial. However, some schools with better conditions, such as Peking University and Tsinghua University, have not yet published such academic publications, which has to be said to be a shortcoming in the work of these schools.

Some people believe that the publication of academic publications should be based on the principle of unity and concentration. In each discipline, only one specialized journal should be published, and many academic publications should not be published separately in various universities. This view is incorrect. Our country's universities are scattered all over the country, numbering more than 200. It is impossible to rely solely on specialized journals to connect and organize the vast number of scientific research workers in universities. In addition to teachers, other scientific personnel and some students also participate in scientific research in universities. Of course, it is impossible to require all scientific papers to have the same high quality. Even if the quality of some papers is low, they should still be given the opportunity to be published. If there is only one journal for each discipline, some papers will not be able to be published, which is detrimental to scientific development.

There can be a certain division of labor between university school journals and national specialized journals. In principle, scientific papers of universal and important significance should be sent to these specialized journals for publication. Important research papers published in university school journals can also be reprinted or appropriately introduced by these journals. Since these national journals have more readers (including domestic and foreign), their influence is also greater. The articles published in these journals should also be some of the more excellent works that can truly represent the academic circles in our country.

In some scientific departments, specialized publications that translate and publish foreign scientific papers have already been published, such as "Biochemistry and Nutrition," "Microbiology Translation," "Soviet Agricultural Science," "Economic Translations," and "Historical Translations," etc. It is good to publish such publications. Although this type of publication should focus on introducing the new achievements of Soviet scientific research as its main task, the articles it translates and publishes should not be limited to treatises written by Soviet scientists, but should also reflect all new and important scientific achievements in various fraternal countries and countries around the world. Currently, some academic publications that publish Chinese scientific treatises also translate and publish relevant foreign scientific papers in a certain amount of space. This is of course feasible in the current situation where our country's scientific research and academic writing power is still very weak, but we should gradually achieve having two types of publications in each science: one that specializes in publishing Chinese scientific treatises and one that specializes in translating and publishing foreign scientific papers. In principle, the former type of publication does not publish translations, or only translates and publishes individual, extremely important foreign academic works.

Among the school journals published by existing universities, some school journals publish both articles guiding teaching work and scientific research papers. We believe that we should strive to gradually change this situation as conditions permit. In principle, universities should specialize in publishing academic school journals, and it is not advisable to put the task of guiding teaching work and publishing scientific research papers on the same school journal.

It must be clearly recognized that specialized journals and academic publications are different in nature from general political propaganda publications and popular science magazines. The readership of specialized journals and academic publications should be, and can only be, specialists in that science. They should be, and can only be, mainly focused on publishing creative scientific treatises, and become a tool for scientific experts to exchange the results and experiences of their academic work. It is the basic responsibility of the editorial board of all academic publications to ensure that specialized journals and various academic publications maintain a certain academic standard. In the early days of liberation, some people, on the grounds that the sales volume of journals was too small, demanded to increase the mass character of the journals; others, due to a narrow understanding of the requirement that academics should serve politics, wanted to add politically propagandist papers to the journals. These views are incorrect. The only criterion for judging whether academic publications are well-run is whether they can provide truly valuable treatises and materials for scientific research work and whether they can promote the development of scientific research work. Academic publications must never increase sales by lowering academic standards. While scientific research must serve politics, this does not mean that general political propaganda should be carried out in academic publications.

But unfortunately, the editorial boards of some journals have not yet established the idea of "quality first" until now. Some so-called "occasional" articles with empty content still often appear in individual academic publications. Some individual journals also publish some translated articles that are not suitable for specialized academic publications in an unselective manner. For example, the "Astronomical Journal" published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Volume 1, Issue 1 and Volume 2, Issue 1, each published an article translated from the Soviet magazine "Nature"; and as everyone knows, the Soviet magazine "Nature" is a popular publication dedicated to the vast number of scientific workers.

The following shortcomings also exist in some of the papers published in some journals: some papers are of very low quality and do not raise or explain any questions; some use unscientific and inaccurate language; some violate some conventions for writing scientific papers, such as not indicating which opinions are taken from other people's works, and so on. These shortcomings should be gradually overcome. Some older scientists still use classical Chinese to write papers due to long-term habits. Although it is very difficult for them to switch to using vernacular Chinese, in scientific publications, efforts should generally be made to use vernacular Chinese in its entirety.

Although everyone knows that debates on different opinions and mutual criticism are one of the most important conditions for the development of science, the lack of an atmosphere of free discussion is still an important shortcoming that currently exists in various academic publications. In some scientific departments, there are clearly some scientific issues that urgently need to be discussed, and there are clearly different opinions on these issues, but they have not been reflected in the journals. This situation of underdeveloped criticism is also reflected in the following situation: that is, the arguments published by some scholars in their papers are actually directed at the opinions of another scholar, but nowhere in his entire paper does he clearly indicate that he disagrees with the opinions of another scholar. This phenomenon should be changed. Specialized journals and other academic publications should become a lively forum for scientific researchers to conduct free debates and mutual criticism.

To do a good job in the publication of journals and academic publications, it is also necessary to obtain the real attention and support of all relevant parties. The working time of part-time editorial board members, as well as some other issues in editing and publishing, often require the active concern and help of all relevant parties to be resolved. In today's China, where academic work is still in its infancy and growing stage, all relevant parties should cherish and vigorously support the work of journals and academic publications, so that our country's scientific undertaking can be better developed and prospered.

    加强专门学报和学术刊物的出版工作
    纳克
    在现代的科学生活中，各种专门学报、学术集刊的出版占有重要的地位。科学的发现和发明，往往首先通过学报、学术集刊来发表，科学研究工作的原始报告、纪录也都记载在学报和专门集刊上。大家知道，在现代科学工作中，一个学者，如果他不去吸收他的先驱者们所做过的工作，不去参考别人的科学论文，是几乎不可能进行任何重要科学问题的研究的；一个现代的工程设计者，如果他不去吸收最新的科学成果，也是几乎不可能完成一个真正现代化的最新设计的；因而各种学报、学术集刊就成为科学工作者、工程专家们所必不可少的参考资料。各种专门学报和学术集刊除了起着传播科学成果、记载科学资料的作用以外，同时还是科学工作者交流思想、开展不同意见的争论的园地，是科学研究工作的组织者和推动者。经验证明，一个专门的学术刊物如果能办得生气勃勃，它便能不断地向学者们提供新的思想，提出新的问题，组织不同意见的争论，刺激、推动研究工作的发展。
    由此可见，加强现有的中国科学院、中华全国自然科学各专门学会所出版的一些全国性的专门学报、学术集刊等刊物，并由各个高等学校单独地或几个学校联合地出版学术性校刊学报，对于推动科学研究工作的发展是具有重要意义的。
    必须使每一门科学都有它自己的专门学报。中国科学院和中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会已经出版了全国性的专门学报、学术集刊达二十六种。这些刊物对于推动我国学术发展曾起了一定的作用。但这些刊物的绝大多数都是属于基础的自然科学方面的学报，而工程科学方面的和社会科学方面的学报却出版得很少，在工程科学方面至今一共只出版有机械工程、土木工程、化学工程、建筑学报等数种；社会科学方面只有历史研究、考古学报、历史研究所第三所集刊等数种。
    高等学校亦应出版综合的或分科的专门性的学术刊物。高等学校单独地或几个学校联合地出版学术刊物，对于推动高等学校中的教师和其他科学人员的科学研究工作有很大的作用，是发掘高等学校科学研究工作潜在力量的有效方法。事实证明，我国的高等学校完全有可能来出版学术刊物。现在已经有十个高等学校出版了学术性校刊或者是兼刊学术论文和指导教学工作的文章的刊物。以厦门大学为例，在过去二年中，曾出了文史、财经、生物数学等三方面的三本学术刊物。而且，这三本学报所刊载的文章的内容也是较充实的。但也还有一些条件较好的学校，如北京大学、清华大学等，至今没有这种学术刊物的出版，这不能不说是这些学校工作的一个缺点。
    有人认为学术刊物的出版应该以统一和集中为原则，在每门学科中，只出一个专门学报，不应该在各个大学分别出版许多学术性刊物。这个意见是不对的。我国高等学校分散各地，数达二百余所，对高等学校中广大的科学研究工作者，不能只靠专门学报来联系和组织。在高等学校中除了教师以外，还有其他科学人员和一部分学生参加科学研究。当然不可能要求所有的科学论文都具有同等的很高的质量。有些论文质量虽然较低，也还应该使它们有发表的机会。如果每一学科只有一种学报，就会使有些论文不能发表，这对科学发展是不利的。
    高等学校的校刊和全国性的专门学报之间是可以有一定的分工的。在原则上，凡是具有普遍的重要意义的科学论文应该送到这些专门学报上去发表，高等学校校刊所发表的一些重要研究论文，这些学报也可以转载或加以适当的介绍。由于这些全国性的学报拥有较多读者（包括国内和国外的），其影响也较大，在这些学报上发表的文章也应该是真正能代表我国学术界的一些较优秀的著作。
    在某些科学部门内，现已出版译载外国科学论文的专门性的刊物，如“生化与营养”、“微生物学译报”、“苏联农业科学”、“经济译丛”、“史学译丛”等等。出版这种刊物是很好的。这种刊物虽然应该以介绍苏联的科学研究的新成就为主要任务，但它们所译载的文章应该不仅限于苏联科学家所撰写的论著，也要同时反映各兄弟国家及世界各国一切新的重要科学成果。现在有些刊载我国科学论著的学术刊物还以一定的篇幅译载有关外国科学论文，这在目前我国科学研究和学术著作的力量还很薄弱的情况下，当然是可行的，但是我们应该逐步做到在各门科学上都有专门发表我国科学论著和专门译载外国科学论文这两种刊物。前一类刊物在原则上不刊登译文，或仅以译载个别极重要的外国学术作品为限。
    在现有的高等学校出版的校刊中，有些校刊是既刊载指导教学工作的文章，又刊载科学研究论文。我们认为，应当争取条件逐步改变这种情形。在原则上，高等学校应该专门出版学术性的校刊，而不宜把指导教学工作和发表科学研究论文的任务放在同一个校刊上。
    必须明确认识专门学报和学术刊物在性质上不同于一般的政治鼓动刊物和通俗的科学杂志。专门学报和学术刊物的读者对象应该是也只能是该门科学的专门家。它们应该是也只能是以刊载创造性的科学论著为主，并成为科学专家们交流学术工作的成果和经验的工具。必须使专门学报和各种学术刊物保持一定的学术水准，这是一切学术刊物的编辑委员会的基本职责。在解放初期，曾经有人以学报的销售量太少为理由，要求增加学报的群众性；也有人由于狭隘地理解了对学术应为政治服务的要求，而想在学报中增加政治鼓动性的论文。这些意见都是不正确的。学术刊物办得好坏的唯一标准，是看它能否为科学研究工作提供真正有价值的论著和资料，能否推动科学研究工作的发展。学术刊物决不能用降低学术水平的办法来增加销售量，科学研究固然要为政治服务，但这决不是说，要在学术刊物上进行一般的政治鼓动。
    但可惜的是，某些学报的编辑委员会直到现在仍未把“质量第一”的思想树立起来。在个别的学术刊物上仍然时常出现一些内容是空空洞洞的所谓“应景”文章。也有个别的学报以一种不加选择的态度刊载一些不适合于专门学术刊物的翻译文章，如中国科学院出版的一卷一期、二卷一期的“天文学报”，就各自发表了一篇从苏联的“自然”杂志上翻译过来的文章；而大家知道、苏联的“自然”杂志是一个专供广大科学工作者阅读的通俗刊物。
    在一部分学报所发表的论文中也还存在着下列一些缺点：有的论文质量很低，没有提出也没有说明任何问题；有的使用了一些不科学不确切的语言；有的违反了撰写科学论文的一些惯例，如没有标明哪些意见是录自别人的著作等等。这些缺点都是应该逐步克服的。有的老科学家则由于长期的习惯，还用文言文来写论文，改用白话文对他们虽很困难，但在科学刊物上，一般都应该努力做到全部用白话文。
    虽然谁都知道，不同意见的争论和相互批评是发展科学的最重要的条件之一，但是缺乏自由讨论的风气仍然是目前各学术刊物普遍存在的一个重要缺点。在某些科学部门中，明明有着若干急待讨论的科学问题，而在这些问题上也明明存在着不同的意见，但是在学报上并没有能得到反映。这种批评不开展的情况也还表现在下面一种情况：即某些学者在其撰写的论文中所发表的议论，实际上是针对着另一学者的意见，但是在他的整篇论文中没有一处很清楚地表明他不同意于另外一位学者的意见。这种现象应当改变。专门学报和其他学术刊物都应该成为科学研究工作者活泼地进行自由争论和互相批评的园地。
    要做好学报和学术刊物的出版工作，还必须得到各有关方面的真正重视和支持。兼职的编辑委员的工作时间，以及编辑出版等方面的一些其他问题，都是常常要靠各有关方面的积极关怀和帮助才能获得解决的。在我国学术工作还处在萌芽、成长阶段的今天，一切有关方面都应该十分珍视和大力支持学报和学术刊物的工作，以便使我国科学事业更好地发展和繁荣起来。
