Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 20th. Indian newspapers continue to publish commentaries, believing that Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China is of great significance.

     The "Glory Daily" published an editorial on the 18th, saying: "This visit is a major event in Asian history and world history. Mr. Nehru once said that Asia will continue to move forward, whether Western countries like it or not."
    The editorial, when mentioning the Five Principles guiding Sino-Indian relations, said that the Five Principles enunciated by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru are supported by action. They have also invited other countries to accept these principles. The editorial said, "Their (Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai) talks will welcome Asian freedom. This meeting will also answer the challenge of Western countries, who still believe that Asian countries need protectors or mentors based on erroneous ideas."
     The "Hindustan Times," in a commentary published on the 17th, recounted Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India in June of this year, saying,
  "At that time, the two Prime Ministers issued a statement on the friendly relations between the two countries based on the Five Principles. Mr. Nehru's visit will further strengthen this relationship."

    印度报纸继续评论尼赫鲁访问我国的意义
    【新华社新德里二十日电】印度报纸继续发表评论，认为尼赫鲁总理访问中国具有重大意义。
     “光荣报”十八日发表社论说：“这次访问在亚洲历史和世界历史上都是重大的事件。尼赫鲁先生曾经说，亚洲将继续努力前进，不管西方国家愿意不愿意。”
    社论在提到指导中印关系的五项原则时说，周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理所阐明的五项原则是有行动加以支持的。他们并且已邀请其他国家接受这些原则。社论说，“他们（尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理）的会谈将欢迎亚洲的自由。这次会谈也将答复西方国家的挑战，它们根据错误的想法仍然认为亚洲国家需要保护人或导师。”
      “印度斯坦报”在十七日发表的评论中追述了今年六月间周恩来总理对印度的访问，评论说，
  “当时，两国总理发表了关于以五项原则为基础的两国友好关系的声明。尼赫鲁先生的这次访问将进一步加强这种关系。”
