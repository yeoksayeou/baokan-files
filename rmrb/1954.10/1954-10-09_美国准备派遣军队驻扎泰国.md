Xinhua News Agency, New York, 6th: The New York Post published a report by columnist Robert Allen on September 29th stating that the US government has formally proposed to the Thai authorities that US troops be stationed in Thailand. Allen wrote: "These US troops will be sent under the Southeast Asia Defense Treaty (i.e., the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty)." The planned US troops to be sent to Thailand include personnel from one division, as well as the equivalent of one air force regiment and several naval units.

Allen wrote: "This proposal was made on the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and this recommendation has been agreed to by the National Security Council after full consideration. President Eisenhower has presided over discussions on these policies."

Allen pointed out that Nai Sarit, the Deputy Minister of Defense of Thailand, who recently led a Thai military delegation to Washington, had discussed this proposal with the Washington authorities and expressed his approval. Nai Sarit, "upon returning to Bangkok, strongly advocated that his government (the Thai government is considering this issue) should accept it."

Allen also revealed that the US authorities are expanding the Thai army. He wrote: "During Nai Sarit's meeting with the leaders of the Pentagon (US Department of Defense), a plan has been drawn up under which the United States will equip and train 30,000 Thai troops and increase this force to 75,000. In addition, (the United States) will send additional air force and other military technicians to Thailand."

    美国准备派遣军队驻扎泰国
   【新华社六日讯】纽约消息：美国“纽约邮报”九月二十九日发表专栏作家罗伯特·艾伦的报道说，美国政府已经正式向泰国当局提出了派遣美国军队驻扎泰国的建议。艾伦写道：“这些美国军队将是根据东南亚防务联盟（按即侵略性的东南亚条约）而派去的。”策划中的派往泰国的美国军队包括一个师的人员以及相当于一个联队的空军和若干海军部队。
    艾伦写道：“这个建议是根据参谋长联席会议的建议而作出的，而这个建议已由国家安全委员会经过充分考虑后予以同意。艾森豪威尔总统曾经主持关于这些政策的讨论。”
    艾伦指出，不久以前率领泰国军事代表团前往华盛顿的泰国国防部副部长乃沙立曾经同华盛顿当局讨论过这个建议，并表示赞同。乃沙立“回到曼谷后，就大力主张他的政府（泰国政府正在考虑这个问题）应该接受它”。
    艾伦还透露，美国当局正在扩充泰国军队。他写道：“在乃沙立同五角大楼（美国国防部）的领袖们会谈期间，已经拟定计划，根据这个计划，美国将装备并训练三万名泰国军队，并把这支军队增加到七万五千名。此外，（美国）还将增派空军和其他军事技术人员到泰国去。”
