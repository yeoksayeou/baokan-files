Xinhua News Agency, October 7th: The Soviet National Folk Dance Troupe held a performance on the evening of the 7th.

    Those who attended the performance included the Ceylon Government Trade Delegation, the Burmese Government Trade Delegation, the Sino-Indian Friendship Association Delegation visiting China, the Ceylon Cultural Delegation, the Japanese Academic and Cultural Delegation visiting China, the Indonesian Delegation visiting China, and the Vietnamese Agricultural Delegation.

    Also attending the performance were the International Democratic Women's Federation delegation, and women's delegations or women's representatives from many countries such as Mongolia, France, Italy, Israel, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Japan.

    Also in attendance were scholars, writers, artists, and journalists from various countries who were invited to visit China and attend the National Day celebrations.

    A total of twelve programs were performed at the event, including the Georgian folk dance "Khorumi" and the Tajik "Knife Dance"; the Russian "Glade Dance" and the Ukrainian suite "Spring Festival"; the Belarusian "Potato Dance"; the dance drama "Partisans", as well as the Chinese "San Cha Kou" and "Red Silk Dance".

    The outstanding and talented performers demonstrated highly skilled artistry in every program. In the "Potato Dance", the dancers skillfully used dance movements to depict the labor process of Belarusian girls planting potatoes in a delicate and moving way, praising the joy and sanctity of labor life. In "Partisans", the actors used their expressions and foot movements to imitate heroes riding on horseback, creating a scene of a cavalry galloping across the stage, demonstrating the fearless spirit of the Soviet people in defending their motherland.

    The audience watched with great interest the Chinese pantomime "San Cha Kou" and "Red Silk Dance" performed by the actors. The members of the Soviet National Folk Dance Troupe had never been to China before. The performers of "San Cha Kou", L. Golovanov and V. Savin, had put in a lot of effort to study the nature and style of this dance drama. Today, the scene of fighting in the inn at night that they performed was as vivid as the performance of Chinese actors.

    苏联国立民间舞蹈团举行表演会
   【新华社七日讯】苏联国立民间舞蹈团七日晚举行表演会。
    前往观看表演的有锡兰政府贸易代表团、缅甸政府贸易代表团、印中友好协会访华代表团、锡兰文化代表团、日本学术文化访华代表团、印度尼西亚访华代表团、越南农业代表参观团。
    前往观看表演的有国际民主妇女联合会代表团，以及蒙古、法国、意大利、以色列、印度尼西亚、越南民主共和国、日本等许多国家的妇女代表团或妇女代表。
    前往观看表演的，还有应邀来我国访问和参加国庆观礼的各国学者、作家、艺术家、记者。
    会上共演出了十二个节目。其中有格鲁吉亚民族舞蹈“霍鲁密”和塔吉克人的“刀舞”；俄罗斯
  “林中空地舞”和乌克兰组舞“春节”；白俄罗斯
  “马铃薯舞”；舞剧“游击队员”，以及中国的“三岔口”和“红绸舞”。
    卓越而富有天才的表演家们，在每一个节目中都表现了高度纯熟的艺术技巧。在“马铃薯舞”中，演员们巧妙地运用舞蹈动作，细腻而动人地描绘出了白俄罗斯姑娘们栽种马铃薯的劳动过程，赞美了劳动生活的愉快和神圣。在“游击队员”中，演员们以他们的表情以及脚部动作，模仿骑在马上的英雄们，在舞台上造成一队骑兵疾驰的情景，表现了苏联人民保卫祖国的无畏精神。
    观众以极大的兴趣观看了演员们表演的中国哑剧“三岔口”和“红绸舞”。苏联国立民间舞蹈团的团员们过去都没有到过中国。“三岔口”的表演者列·戈洛凡诺夫和瓦·萨文，为了研究这个舞剧的性质和风格，曾经花费很大的劳动。今天他们所表演的那个旅店中黑夜相打的场面和中国演员演出的一样维妙维肖。
