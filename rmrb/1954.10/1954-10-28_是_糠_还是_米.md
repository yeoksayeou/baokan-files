    Is It "Bran" or "Rice"?
    Chen Qingsheng of the Yutian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province writes: In August, the Woluogu Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yutian County, Hebei Province, transported 10,984 jin of millet bran from the Tangshan Municipal People's Government Grain Bureau’s directly-affiliated processing factory. It was discovered that it contained a large amount of rice. After processing, these 10,984 jin of millet bran yielded 7,276 jin of millet rice (including 1,033 jin of whole rice and 6,243 jin of broken rice), accounting for 66.24% of the original "bran"; pure bran was only 3,482 jin, accounting for 31.7% of the original bran; and 226 jin were lost during processing.

    People exclaimed in surprise: Bran containing more than 66% rice, it’s more like "rice" than "bran"! How can it be called "bran containing rice"? It should be called rice containing bran!

    The 7,276 jin of rice processed from the "bran," sold at a price of 1,050 yuan per jin, has a total value of 7,639,800 yuan; if sold as bran at 500 yuan per jin, the total value would only be 3,638,000 yuan, a loss of more than half to the state.

    The Tangshan Municipal People's Government Grain Bureau and its affiliated processing factory's bureaucratic attitude of indifference to state property is truly intolerable! We hope that the relevant leading departments in Tangshan will promptly conduct a thorough investigation into this issue and take serious action.

    Editor's Note: The situation reflected by Comrade Chen Qingsheng has been investigated by our newspaper's reporter and proven to be true, and similar situations have occurred more than once in the factory. When selling this kind of "bran" containing rice, although the price was slightly higher than pure bran (pure bran was 320 yuan per jin, this "bran" was calculated at 500 yuan), the state still suffered undue losses.

    Why is this happening? It is understood that the main reason is that the leading cadres of the Tangshan Municipal Grain Bureau’s directly-affiliated processing factory have a capitalist management ideology and a supply system ideology that simply pursues profits. They only aim to process more to get more processing fees, regardless of the quality of the processed grain or how much the state's original grain is lost during processing. Therefore, although the factory's rice yield has long been lower than private processing factories, and the situation of rice mixed in bran often occurs, the leading cadres have not actively educated the workers, nor have they worked with the workers to study and improve operating techniques to reduce losses for the state. In addition, the Tangshan Municipal Grain Bureau has abandoned leadership over the processing factory, failing to sign a formal contract with the processing factory for more than a year; it has also failed to adhere to principles and seriously deal with the processing factory's failure to deliver grain according to standards and the problem of rice in bran. Due to the Grain Bureau's lax management of grain processing, private merchants have also taken advantage of loopholes. Last year, private processing factories throughout the city exploited the Grain Bureau's lax supervision, mixed broken rice into bran, and stole state grain under the guise of selling broken rice bran to seek illegal profits. Although it was later investigated and exposed, the phenomenon of Tangshan's private processing factories failing to meet contractually stipulated standards for grain output and lowering grain quality to enrich themselves at public expense still exists.

    The above situation deserves widespread attention from all regions. According to our understanding: private processing factories using despicable means such as adulteration, mixing with soil, and fanning broken rice into bran to steal state grain have also been discovered in Baoding City, Hebei Province, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, and other places. As for the low rice yield of state-owned processing factories, it is not an isolated case either. Grain is one of the essential materials indispensable for national construction and people's lives, and it must not be treated with a careless attitude. People's governments and grain departments in all regions should attach importance to the leadership and management of grain processing, ensure that the prescribed rice yield is achieved, and eliminate all loopholes that waste grain.

### 是“糠”还是“米”

    是“糠”还是“米”
    中共河北省玉田县委员会陈庆生来信：八月间，河北省玉田县窝洛沽镇供销合作社从唐山市人民政府粮食管理局直属加工厂运来糜糠一万零九百八十四斤，发现里边含有大量的米。经过加工，这一万零九百八十四斤糜糠中，竟出糜米七千二百七十六斤（其中整米一千零三十三斤，碎米六千二百四十三斤），占原“糠”数的百分之六十六点二四；纯糠却只有三千四百八十二斤，占原糠数的百分之三十一点七；另外加工损耗了二百二十六斤。
    人们惊奇地议论着：糠里竟含有百分之六十六以上的米，这与其说是“糠”，还不如说是“米”！怎能说是“糠里含米”，应该说是米里含糠！
    从“糠”里加工出来的七千二百七十六斤米，每斤出售价以一千零五十元计算，总值共达七百六十三万九千八百元；若当糠出卖，每斤五百元，总值只三百六十三万八千元，国家损失达一半以上。
    唐山市人民政府粮食管理局及其所属加工厂这种对国家资财漠不关心的官僚主义态度，实在令人难以容忍！希望唐山市有关领导部门对此问题迅速深入检查，并作严肃处理。
    编者按：陈庆生同志反映的情况，经本报记者调查，证明是确实的，而且类似情况在该厂发生还不止一次。该厂在出卖这种带米的“糠”时，虽然价格比纯糠提高了一点（纯糠每斤是三百二十元，这种“糠”是以五百元计算的），但国家仍旧遭受了不应有的损失。
    为什么会这样呢？据了解主要是由于唐山市粮食局直属加工厂的领导干部有着单纯追逐利润的资本主义经营思想和供给制思想。他们只图多加工多得加工费，不管加工出来粮食的好坏，也不管在加工过程中国家原粮损失了多少。因此，虽然该厂出米率长期低于私营加工厂，糠里混米的情况经常出现，但领导干部并没有积极教育工人，并和工人一起钻研改进操作技术，为国家减少损失。此外，唐山市粮食局对加工厂放弃领导，一年多未与加工厂订立正式合同；对加工厂不能按标准交粮和糠中有米的问题，也没有坚持原则，严肃处理。由于粮食局对粮食加工工作管理不严，私商也从中钻了空子。去年全市私营加工厂中钻粮食局监督不严的空子，把碎米混在糠内，以卖碎米糠为名盗窃国家粮食谋取非法利润的情况很普遍。后来虽然检查揭发，唐山市私营加工厂不按照合同规定标准出粮降低粮质损公肥私的现象，仍然存在。
    上述情况，值得引起各地的普遍注意。据我们了解：私营加工厂用掺杂、掺土和把碎米扇到糠里等卑鄙手段盗窃国家粮食的情况，在河北保定市、浙江江山县等地也有发现。至于国家加工厂出米率低的情况，也并不是个别的。粮食是国家建设和人民生活中必不可少的重要物资之一，决不能容许以漫不经心的态度来对待粮食工作。各地人民政府和粮食部门应该重视对粮食加工工作的领导和管理，保证达到规定的出米率，杜绝一切浪费粮食的漏洞。
