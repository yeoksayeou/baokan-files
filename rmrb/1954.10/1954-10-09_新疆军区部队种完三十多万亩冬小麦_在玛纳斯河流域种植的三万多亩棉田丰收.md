The agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army had sown over 300,000 mu of winter wheat by the end of September. The early-sown winter wheat has now emerged from the soil and grown to about 10 centimeters high, with patches of green appearing in the fields. Based on several years of experience, the agricultural production troops have expanded the sowing area by more than 70,000 mu this year due to the high yield and good quality of winter wheat, and have also made great improvements in cultivation techniques. All 300,000 mu of winter wheat land has been sown by machine in rows. Before sowing, deep plowing and meticulous land preparation were carried out, and most of the land was fertilized with base fertilizer. The selected high-quality wheat seeds were also generally carefully selected and treated with pesticides; some units used the Ukrainian winter wheat variety entirely this year.

The agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Manas River Basin have reaped a bumper harvest on more than 30,000 mu of cotton fields. According to preliminary assessments by various units, the average yield can reach more than 400 jin of seed cotton per mu, exceeding the average yield of the large-scale cotton fields of more than 20,000 mu last year. Currently, all personnel of the agricultural production troops are busy picking cotton.

This year's bumper harvest by the agricultural production troops was achieved after a arduous struggle against natural disasters. This year, the climate in the Manas River Basin was erratic, with more rain and lower temperatures before and after spring sowing, creating unfavorable conditions for cotton planting. However, under the guidance of Professor Titov of the Xinjiang "August 1st" Agricultural College and Soviet agricultural experts, the production troops adopted advanced Soviet cotton planting techniques, and finally overcame the natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest.

Since the beginning of October, the agricultural production troops have launched a cotton picking competition. Every day, at dawn, cadres and soldiers, carrying cotton picking bags, enter the cotton fields and work until dark. The leading organs of the Xinjiang Military Region also transferred more than 1,000 people from directly subordinate units and troops stationed in Urumqi to the reclamation area in the Manas River Basin by car on October 2nd and 3rd to support the picking of cotton. The slogan of the cadres and soldiers of the agricultural production troops is to strive to pick the cotton well and hand over the bumper harvest of cotton to the state.

    新疆军区部队种完三十多万亩冬小麦
    在玛纳斯河流域种植的三万多亩棉田丰收
    中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队，到九月底已播种完三十多万亩冬小麦。早播的冬小麦现在已出土长到十公分左右高，田野里呈现出片片绿色。农业生产部队根据几年来的经验，由于冬小麦产量高、质量好，今年播种面积比去年扩大了七万多亩，在耕作技术上也有很大的改进。三十多万亩冬小麦地全部采用机器条播。播种前，普遍进行了深耕和细致的整地工作，并大部施用了基肥。所选用的优良麦种也普遍地进行了精选和药剂处理；有的单位，今年全部用了乌克兰冬小麦品种。

    中国人民解放军新疆军区驻玛纳斯河流域的农业生产部队种植的三万多亩棉田获得了丰收，根据各单位的初步鉴定，平均每亩可产籽棉四百多斤，超过去年二万多亩大面积棉田丰产的平均产量。现在农业生产部队全体人员正在紧张地摘拾棉花。
    今年农业生产部队的丰收是在和自然灾害作了艰巨斗争后取得的。今年玛纳斯河流域气候变化无常，春播前后雨水较多，气温较低，造成植棉的不利条件。但是生产部队在新疆“八一”农学院教授、苏联农学专家提托夫的指导下，采用了苏联先进的植棉技术，终于战胜了自然灾害，获得了丰收。
    自十月初以来，农业生产部队展开了拾棉竞赛。每天天亮干部、战士们便挂着拾棉包进入棉田，一直劳动到天黑。新疆军区领导机关还抽调了直属单位和驻乌鲁木齐部队共一千多人，在十月二、三两日乘汽车到玛纳斯河流域垦区支援摘拾棉花。农业生产部队干部、战士的口号是争取拾好花，把丰收的棉花上缴给国家。　（据新华社讯）
