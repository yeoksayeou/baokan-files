    Our Army is Marching Towards Modernization
    Delegate to the National People's Congress
    Regimental Commander of a Unit of the People's Liberation Army, Zhang Ming
      On the anniversary of the October Revolution in 1950, I, along with all the members of our Chinese Youth Delegation to the Soviet Union, witnessed the grand military parade and the festive march of the working people on the viewing platform of Red Square in Moscow. A few minutes before the parade began, the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government walked onto the reviewing stand amidst thunderous applause. The solemn Soviet national anthem and the roar of salutes echoed across Red Square. Then, Marshal Budyonny began the review. The heroic ranks began to move, with the army, navy, and air force marching in order. After the infantry marched past in perfect step, a rumble of engines filled the air. At that moment, powerful mechanized units, armored vehicles, and tank units followed, along with artillery units equipped with field guns, howitzers, cannons, self-propelled guns, and the world-renowned Katyusha rockets...Like a steel torrent passing before the people, it left a deep impression on me. At the time, I thought: The Soviet army is an invincible, modernized armed force, a powerful force for defending peace; the Soviet army is an example for our Chinese People's Liberation Army. I also thought that as long as we follow the Soviet path, one day an army as modern as the Soviet army will appear in our motherland.
    After the liberation of the mainland, in order to lay a solid foundation for the regularization and modernization of our army, the entire army concentrated its main efforts on cultural studies for a year. Then, regular military training began.
    I am an army commander, and to train the troops well, I must first study well myself. When I heard that the higher authorities were transferring me to a military school to study, I was truly excited beyond words. I thought: Although our people's revolution has been victorious, the aggression of imperialism still threatens us, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, fostered by the United States, still occupies Taiwan. To prevent imperialist aggression, to liberate Taiwan, the People's Liberation Army must be built into a regularized and modernized national defense army. Therefore, we must study advanced Soviet military science well, so that we can gradually master the military art of modern warfare and improve our command capabilities. Later, I received excellent grades of five points several times in my studies.
    After the regular training of the entire army began, everyone in the unit was in high spirits. In the summer, regardless of the hot weather or rainy conditions, all commanders and fighters persisted in regular military training in the field. Therefore, in a very short period, our regular training achieved very good results. Take shooting as an example. In the first phase of training, the average passing rate for rifle target practice was only 18 percent, but in the second phase, it increased to 70 to 80 percent, and some companies even reached 100 percent. The fifth squad of a certain company—the Chen Jinhe squad—is a squad with very good academic performance. The heroic act of Chen Jinhe in the battle for Baishan on the Weishan Lake in southern Shandong during the Liberation War, in which he bravely destroyed the enemy's bunker, inspires every soldier of today's Chen Jinhe squad. They all take the noble qualities of the hero as an example for learning. Luo Ying, the current squad leader of the Chen Jinhe squad and a communist party member, is a very good instructor. He is very strict with himself and his soldiers, believing that the main way to care for his subordinates is to teach them the skills of combat and educate them to become brave people's fighters. In regular training, squad leader Luo Ying and the soldiers were as united as one, and they were always able to complete each stage of learning. Luo Ying is an excellent shooter. Once, during a demonstration shooting at a distance of 100 meters, he fired a total of thirty-five bullets, thirty-four of which hit the target. Another time, he achieved amazing results in a shooting exercise: at that time, many human-shaped targets in the distance rose and fell together. He ran and shot, hitting every target. He had just fired half of the prescribed bullets when he had eliminated all the targets, saving bullets and time. The soldiers of the fifth squad competed to learn the spirit of hard study and the skillful military techniques of squad leader Luo Ying. As a result, their shooting skills greatly improved, and the entire squad received the "Excellent Shooting" award flag. Recently, the Chen Jinhe squad has been awarded the title of "Second-Class Meritorious Squad" for continuously achieving new results in regular training.
    Our People's Liberation Army has very rich combat experience and military construction experience. These valuable experiences were exchanged for the lives and blood of countless martyrs. At the same time, the volunteer army brothers created valuable and rich experience on the Korean battlefield. We must combine these experiences with advanced Soviet military science to build our People's Liberation Army into an excellent modern revolutionary army.
    This time I came to Beijing to attend the National People's Congress. When the train we were riding on passed through the battlefield of the Liberation War on the Weishan Lake in southern Shandong, I couldn't help but recall my old comrade-in-arms, the martyr Chen Jinhe. He contributed his precious life with incomparable bravery for the victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause. Thinking of this, I felt very sad, because Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and our people's liberation cause has not yet been finally completed. In his speech at the 27th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army on August 1st of this year, Commander-in-Chief Zhu said: "If Taiwan is not liberated for one day, the people of the whole country, especially the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, will not wash away the shame on their bodies for one day." At this National People's Congress, I also heard the speech of Delegate Xie Xuehong. She is a Taiwanese, and in her speech, she reflected the deep desire of eight million compatriots in Taiwan to be liberated. She said: "When people are in pain, they call out to their mothers. The people of Taiwan in suffering can only call out to the motherland..." Her words moved me to tears. I deeply feel that our motherland's territory, Taiwan, has not been liberated, and eight million compatriots in Taiwan are still living a painful life under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is indeed our shame, and we must wash away this shame. In the future regular military training, I must actively study advanced Soviet military science, strive to master the military art of modern warfare, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan, the complete elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the defense of the socialist construction of the motherland, and the defense of peace in Asia and the world!

    我们的陆军正在向现代化迈进
    全国人民代表大会代表
    人民解放军某部团长  张明
      一九五零年十月革命节那天，我和我们中国青年访苏代表团所有的团员一起，在莫斯科红场的观礼台上看到了盛大的阅兵式和劳动人民的节日游行。阅兵开始前几分钟，苏联共产党和政府的领袖们在一片如雷的掌声中走上检阅台，红场上响起庄严肃穆的苏联国歌声和礼炮的轰鸣，接着，布琼尼元帅开始阅兵。英雄的行列开始移动了，陆、海、空军部队顺序行进；步伐整齐的步兵走过以后，接着响起一片隆隆的马达声，这时，强大的机械化部队、装甲车、坦克部队，随后就是配有野炮、榴弹炮、加农炮、自动推进炮和举世闻名的喀秋莎大炮的炮兵部队……像一股钢铁的洪流在人们面前通过，给了我十分深刻的印象。当时我想：苏联军队是一支无敌的现代化武装力量，是一支强大的保卫和平的力量；苏联军队是我们中国人民解放军的榜样。当时我又想，只要我们走苏联的道路，总有一天像苏联这样的一支现代化军队会在我们祖国出现的。
    全国大陆解放之后，为了给我们军队的正规化现代化建设打好基础，我们全军以主要时间集中进行了一年的文化学习。接着就开始了正规的军事训练。
    我是一个陆军指挥员，要把部队训练好，首先自己就必须学习好。当我听到上级调我去军事学校学习的时候，我真有说不出的兴奋。我想：我们的人民革命虽然胜利了，但是帝国主义的侵略仍然威胁着我们，美国豢养的蒋介石卖国集团仍然盘踞着台湾。为了防止帝国主义的侵略，为了解放台湾，必须把人民解放军建设成一支正规化现代化的国防军队，因此就必须好好学习苏联先进的军事科学，以便能逐渐掌握现代作战的军事艺术，提高自己的指挥能力。后来，我在学习中几次都得到了五分的优秀成绩。
    全军正规训练开始以后，部队里每个人的情绪都很高。在夏季里，不管在大热天或雨地里，全体指战员们仍然坚持着野外的正规军事训练。因此，在很短的时期里，我们的正规训练就取得了很好的成绩。拿射击一项来说吧，在第一期训练中，步枪打靶及格的平均只占百分之十八，而到了第二期，就提高到百分之七十到八十，有的连队还达到百分之百。某连五班——陈金合班，就是学习成绩很好的一个班。英雄陈金合在解放战争时期的鲁南微山湖畔柏山争夺战中，舍身炸毁敌人碉堡的勇敢行为，鼓舞着今天的陈金合班的每一个战士，他们都以英雄的高贵品质作为学习的榜样。陈金合班现任班长、共产党员罗英，是一个很好的教练员，平时对自己和他的战士们都要求得非常严格，他认为对部属关心，主要的就是教会他们作战的本领，教育他们成为勇敢的人民战士。在正规训练中，班长罗英和战士们团结得像一个人一样，他们总是能够完成每个阶段的学习任务。罗英是一个出色的射击手，有一次，他作一百公尺距离的示范射击时，一共打了三十五发子弹，就有三十四发打中了目标。另一次，他在射击演习中得到了惊人的成绩：当时，只见远处好多个人头靶一起一落，他边跑边打，百发百中，刚打完规定的子弹的一半，就消灭了全部目标，并且节省了子弹和时间。五班的战士们竞相学习班长罗英勤学苦练的精神和熟练的军事技术，结果射击技术大大提高，全班得到了“射击优秀”的奖旗。最近，陈金合班又因为在正规训练中不断得到新的成绩而被评为“二等功臣班”。
    我们人民解放军有着非常丰富的战斗经验和军事建设经验，这些可贵的经验，都是无数先烈付出生命和鲜血换来的；同时，志愿军兄弟部队在朝鲜战场上创造了宝贵而丰富的经验，我们要把这些经验和先进的苏联军事科学结合起来，把我们人民解放军建成一支优秀的现代化革命军队。
    这次我到北京来开全国人民代表大会会议，当我们坐的火车通过鲁南微山湖畔解放战争时期的战场的时候，我不禁忆念起我的老战友陈金合烈士。为了中国人民解放事业的胜利，他无比英勇地贡献了自己宝贵的生命。想到这里，我心中非常沉痛，因为今天台湾还没有解放，我们的人民解放事业还没有最后完成。今年八月一日朱总司令在人民解放军建军二十七周年的纪念会上的讲话中说：“台湾一天不解放，我们全国人民，首先是人民解放军指战员，就一天没有洗清自己身上的耻辱”。这次在全国人民代表大会会议上，我又听到了谢雪红代表的发言。她是台湾人，她在发言中反映了八百万台湾同胞期待解放的深切的愿望。她说：“人在痛苦的时候呼喊母亲，在苦难中的台湾人民只有呼喊祖国……”她的话使我感动得流泪。我深深地感觉到，我们祖国的领土台湾没有解放，八百万台湾同胞还在蒋介石卖国集团的统治下过着痛苦的生活，这的确是我们的耻辱，我们一定要清洗这个耻辱。今后在正规军事训练中，我一定要积极学习先进的苏联军事科学，努力掌握现代作战的军事艺术，为解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团；为保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗！
