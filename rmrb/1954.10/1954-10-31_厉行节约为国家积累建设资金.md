    Wuhan Factories Launch Labor Emulation Drives
    Achievements in Conserving Raw Materials and Reducing Defective Products
    Workers in Wuhan factories, focusing on improving quality and reducing costs, have launched labor emulation drives successively since the beginning of October.
    Textile system workers, targeting the high cotton consumption and high breakage rate, the two biggest problems, have formulated technical measures plans, continued to promote advanced experiences such as "small-batch blending" and "pagoda layering," strictly controlled cotton blending components and workshop temperature and humidity, and implemented measures such as waste cotton recovery. In the first half of October, the average cotton consumption per yarn bale in the city's five yarn factories decreased by an average of 6.71 jin compared to the past. The joint state-private Shenxin Yarn Factory saves more than 29,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day.
    In the machinery system, a common problem is the high number of defective castings, resulting in significant waste. The state-owned Wuhan Automobile Parts Factory strengthened its defective product analysis and intermediate inspection system, and workers consciously abided by operating procedures and actively learned technology, reducing the defective casting rate from a peak of 90 percent to 17 percent, and stabilizing it.
    Workers at the joint state-private Nanyang Tobacco Factory in the light industry system found ways to improve ventilation and transmission equipment and strictly control tobacco leaf losses in each process, reducing the tobacco leaf consumption per carton of cigarettes from 127.74 jin to 121.53 jin, which is 2.47 jin lower than the new quota set by the Ministry of Light Industry. Workers at the joint state-private Wuhan Paint Factory uniformly mastered grinding, improving the quality of the paint to grade eight, and reducing the oil loss rate of the blender to 1.65 percent.
  Sixty-Five Cotton Textile Factories in Shanghai Strive to
    Implement Safe, Rational, and Economical Use of Electricity
    Sixty-five major state-owned, joint state-private, and some private cotton textile factories in Shanghai are further launching comprehensive safety, rational, and economical electricity use emulation drives. The electricity consumption of these sixty-five cotton textile factories accounts for 48.6 percent of Shanghai's total industrial electricity consumption. Since the first quarter of this year, due to the attention paid by various cotton textile factories to rational and economical electricity use, the factories saved more than 10.43 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in half a year. Electricity consumption in the third quarter continued to decline, with the nineteen state-owned textile printing and dyeing factories alone saving more than 2.33 million kilowatt-hours. However, the work of saving electricity in various factories is uneven. For example, the lowest electricity consumption for producing one 20-count wrapped yarn has reached 153 degrees, while many units still need 248 degrees. In response to this situation, Shanghai's textile factories are continuing to work hard to implement rational and economical electricity use on the basis of safe production and ensuring quality, and are formulating specific plans.
  Yumen Mining Bureau Increases Production and Saves 40 Billion Yuan
    Since launching the production increase and thrift emulation drive in August, the Yumen Mining Bureau workers have increased production and saved 46.5 billion yuan of wealth for the country by the end of September.
    The basic construction and major production departments of the Yumen Mining Bureau overfulfilled the state plan ahead of schedule in the third quarter, and the auxiliary production departments such as the machinery plant, hydropower plant, and transportation team also overfulfilled the plan by more than 25 percent. The technical innovation movement has been widely launched among workers, and more than 800 rationalization proposals were put forward by all workers in the third quarter. Jiang Ruilin, a dispatcher at the Oil Production Department, suggested using salt-containing crude oil to wash wells and handle accidents, which can save 280 million yuan per year; the workers in the instrument room of the refinery improved four instruments, saving more than 70 million yuan. Production departments such as oil production, machinery, and hydropower, as well as basic construction departments, have also established more than 20 technical research groups, which have played a certain role in solving key production problems.
  Three Work Zones of Northeast First Engineering Company
    Strengthen Material and Tool Recovery Work
    The Second, Fourth, and Fifth Work Zones of the First Engineering Company of the Northeast Engineering Bureau have strengthened material recovery and tool recovery work in the current stage of project completion, saving a large amount of funds for the country. In the closing stage, the Second Work Zone promptly proposed the slogans "Do not lose a single material, do not lose a single tool" and "Eliminate the five heads" (i.e., brick heads, wood heads, rebar heads, pipe heads, wire heads), and "Remove the five bottoms" (i.e., sand bottoms, stone bottoms, oil drum bottoms, ash bag bottoms, ash trough bottoms), and the trade union set up a gift stand to encourage workers to do a good job in recovery. The Fifth Work Zone promptly proposed the slogan "Work completed, site cleared" and called on all employees to do a good job in the recovery of materials and tools at the end of the project. The work zone leaders of the Fourth Work Zone personally arranged the recovery work and organized a closing team for timely inspection. By the end of September, the Fifth Work Zone had saved more than 1.63 billion yuan, the Fourth Work Zone had saved more than 5.3 billion yuan, and the Second Work Zone had also achieved great results.
  Weaving Workers of Tianjin Fourth Cotton Textile Factory
    Strive to Reduce Fluff Waste and Save Raw Cotton
    According to the key problems of "low quality, great waste" existing in the production of this work section, the weaving workers of the state-owned Tianjin Fourth Cotton Textile Factory universally checked the phenomenon of fluff waste at the beginning of the third quarter, and under the slogan of "Weave every inch of yarn into cloth," they came up with various ways to eliminate the waste of fluff. When the car workers checked their work attitude, strengthened the patrol, and reduced the fluff waste caused by dismantling the cloth. In the past, workers used fluff to wipe the reed, but now they have changed to calico wrapped in cotton, which also reduces some fluff waste. The shuttle installers conscientiously implement the work method, reduce the fluff from winding the weft yarn, and can save about two pounds of fluff every day, and basically eliminate the fluff from the "yarn bundle." In this way, they can produce more than six pounds less fluff a day. Now, the total fluff wasted in the entire weaving section has been reduced by about ten pounds per day compared with the previous third quarter.
  Dalian Garment Factory Workers Improve Tailoring Methods
    Reduce Cloth Scraps and Save Cotton Cloth for the Country
    Since the state announced the implementation of the planned supply of cotton cloth, the workers of the local state-owned Dalian Garment Factory have actively tried to improve tailoring methods, reduce cloth scraps, and save cotton cloth for the country. In the past, tailoring workers did not have precise uniform standards in their operations, and each person had their own set of operating methods, resulting in waste in their work. Now, technicians and workers have jointly developed the scale standard, and after universally applying this tailoring method, each piece of clothing can save 0.02 meters of cloth. In September, when processing 1,400 pairs of eight-inch canvas gloves for the Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory, the tailoring workers of the Second Retail Department saved more than 73 meters of canvas after implementing the drawing. The tailoring workers in the first workshop changed the operation method of drawing patterns, eliminating the phenomenon of leftover cloth scraps. They saved 3,729 meters of cotton cloth in the more than 20,000 cotton overcoats processed for department stores. Recently, the workers have also actively researched the use of linen instead of cotton cloth to make cotton clothes and quilted lining, in order to save more cotton cloth for the country.
  Nanzhang Distillery Successfully Trials Acorns for Distilling Liquor
    Can Save 500,000 Jin of Grain in the Fourth Quarter
    Workers at the Hubei Nanzhang Local State-Owned Distillery have successfully trialed acorns for distilling liquor, and it is estimated that they can save 500,000 jin of staple grain for the country in the fourth quarter of this year, and increase the sideline income of farmers by 200 million yuan. From December of last year to the present, the distillery has used acorns to distill liquor three times. The first two trials failed due to lack of experience and insufficient reliance on the workers' ideas by the leaders. During the third experiment, the leaders first convened a general meeting of all employees, explained the great significance of using substitutes to distill liquor to save staple grain and support national industrial construction, and according to the opinions put forward by the workers, sent cadres to the countryside to absorb the experience of farmers in using acorns to distill liquor, and as a result, the trial was successful. Every 100 jin of acorns can produce 18 jin of small qu liquor, and if large qu is used, it can produce 27 jin of large qu liquor.

    厉行节约为国家积累建设资金
    武汉市各工厂展开劳动竞赛
    节约原材料减少废品有成绩
    武汉市各工厂职工以提高质量、降低成本为重点，从十月初起先后展开了劳动竞赛。
    纺织系统的职工针对用棉量和断头率高两个最大的问题，订出了技术措施计划，继续推广“小量混棉”、“宝塔分段”等先进经验，严格控制配棉成分、车间温湿度，并执行废花收回等措施。在十月上半月中，全市五个纱厂每件纱的用棉量平均比过去减少了六点七一斤。公私合营申新纱厂每天并节约用电两万九千度以上。
    在机械系统方面，普遍的问题是铸件废品多，造成很大的浪费。国营武汉汽车配件厂加强了废品分析和中间检验制度，工人们并自觉遵守操作规程，积极学习技术，使铸件废品率由过去最高的百分之九十降为百分之十七，并且稳定下来。
    轻工业系统的公私合营南洋烟厂职工设法改善通风和传送设备，严格控制每道工序上的烟叶损耗，使每箱烟的用烟叶量由过去一二七点七四斤降为一二一点五三斤，比轻工业部新定额低二点四七斤。公私合营武汉制漆厂职工均匀掌握碾磨，使漆的质量提高到八级，并将调和器使用油的损耗率降到百分之一点六五。
  上海六十五个棉纺织工厂努力
    实行安全合理和节约用电
    上海市六十五个主要国营、公私合营和部分私营棉纺织工厂，进一步展开全面的安全合理节约用电竞赛。这六十五个棉纺织厂的用电量占上海全市工业用电量的百分之四十八点六。从今年第一季度起由于各棉纺织厂注意合理节约用电，半年内各厂共节约电一千零四十三万度以上。第三季的耗电量又继续下降，仅据十九个国营纺织印染厂的统计，就节约了二百三十三万多度电。但各厂节约用电工作是不平衡的，如同样生产一件二十支包纱，最低的用电已到一百五十三度，而不少单位仍需要二百四十八度电。针对这一情况，上海各纺织厂在安全生产、保证品质的基础上，继续努力实行了合理节约用电，并正在制订具体计划。
  玉门矿务局增产节约四百亿元
    玉门矿务局职工自八月份开展增产节约竞赛以来，到九月底已经为国家增产节约了四百六十五亿元的财富。
    玉门矿务局第三季度基本建设和主要生产部门都提前超额完成了国家计划，机械厂、水电厂、运输大队等辅助生产部门，也都超额完成计划百分之二十五以上。技术革新运动已在职工中广泛展开，第三季度全体职工提出的合理化建议有八百多件。采油处调度员蒋瑞林建议利用含盐原油来洗井和处理事故，全年可节约二亿八千万元；炼油厂仪器室的职工改进了四种仪器，共节约七千多万元。采油、机械、水电等生产部门和基本建设部门也都先后成立了二十多个技术研究小组，对解决生产上的关键问题起了一定作用。
  东北第一工程公司三个工区
    加强材料和工具回收工作
    东北工程管理局第一工程公司二工区、四工区和五工区，在目前工程收尾的阶段中，加强了材料回收和工具回收工作，给国家节省了大批资金。二工区在收尾阶段及时提出了“不丢一材，不丢一具”和“消灭五头”（即砖头、木材头、钢筋头、管子头、电线头），以及“清除五底”（即砂子底、石头底、油桶底、灰袋底、灰槽底）的口号，并由工会设立了献礼台，鼓舞工人做好回收工作。五工区及时提出“工完场清”的口号，号召全体职工做好工程收尾时的材料和工具的回收工作。四工区的工区领导方面，亲自布置回收工作，并组织了收尾小组及时进行检查。到九月底，五工区节约了十六亿三千多万元，四工区节约了五十三亿多万元，二工区也取得了很大的成绩。
  天津第四棉纺织厂织布工人
    努力减少回丝节约原棉
    国营天津第四棉纺织厂的织布工人根据本工段生产中存在的“质量低、浪费大”的关键问题，在第三季度初，普遍检查了回丝浪费的现象，并在“把每一寸纱都织成布”的口号下，想出了各种办法来杜绝回丝的浪费。当车工检查了劳动态度，加强了巡回，减少了拆布时造成的回丝浪费。过去，工人都用回丝擦筬簧把，现在都改用棉花包的包皮布，这也减少了一部分回丝浪费。装梭工人们认真执行工作法，减少装纬纱拉线的回丝，每天即可节约两磅左右的回丝，并基本上消灭了出“纱把”的回丝。这样，他们一天就能少出六磅多回丝。现在，全织布工段每天浪费的回丝已比第三季度以前每日减少了十磅上下。
  大连被服厂职工改进剪裁方法
      减少布头为国家节约棉布
    自从国家公布实行棉布计划供应以后，地方国营大连被服厂职工，积极想办法改进剪裁方法，减少布头，为国家节约棉布。过去剪裁工人在操作中没有精确的统一的标准，各人有各人的一套操作方法，在工作中造成了浪费。现在技术人员和工人共同将缩尺标准研究成功，普遍运用这种剪裁方法后，每件衣服可以节约零点零二公尺布。第二门市部剪裁工人，在九月份，为大连工矿车辆厂加工一千四百付八寸长的帆布手套时，实行按图下料以后，就节约了帆布七十三公尺多。第一车间剪裁工人改变画样子的操作方法，消灭了剩布头的现象。他们在为百货公司加工的两万多件棉大衣中，就节约了三千七百二十九公尺棉布。最近职工们又积极研究用亚麻布代替棉布做棉衣和夹衣里布，以便为国家节约更多的棉布。
  南漳酒厂试用橡子蒸酒成功
    第四季度可节粮五十万斤
    湖北南漳地方国营酒厂职工试用橡子蒸酒成功，预计今年第四季度可为国家节约主粮五十万斤，并可使农民增加副业收入两亿元。从去年十二月开始到现在，酒厂已试用橡子蒸过三次酒，前两次的试制工作，由于缺乏经验，同时领导方面依靠职工的思想不够明确，都失败了。第三次试验时，领导方面首先召开了全体职工大会，说明用代食品蒸酒节约主粮，支援国家工业建设的重大意义，并根据职工们提出的意见，派干部到农村吸收农民用橡子蒸酒的经验，结果试制成功，每百斤橡子可制小曲酒十八斤，如用大曲则可制大曲酒二十七斤。
