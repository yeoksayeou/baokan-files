    Irresponsible Work Attitude Causes National Grain Losses
      Editor's Note: Readers Cao Xian and Chen Jianhua from the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau Receiving and Transporting Office wrote to report that of the 2,500 bags (500,000 jin) of rice shipped from Wannian County, Jiangxi Province to Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province in April and May of this year, most of it had deteriorated, with temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius. Although the receiving unit salvaged it, the state has suffered considerable losses. After investigation by this newspaper, the situation revealed by the readers was proven to be true. The reason for this grain loss accident is that some cadres have adopted an irresponsible attitude towards state property. The reply from the Wannian County Grain Bureau is published below, hoping that grain departments in various regions will learn from this lesson and educate cadres to treat grain transportation and storage work with a highly responsible attitude.
    Reply from Wannian County Grain Bureau: The 500,000 jin of rice that our bureau transported to Zhenjiang, Jiangsu was processed and packed for shipment on April 18. When processed, the Shizhen Street No. 2 Grain Depot of our bureau tested the moisture content to be 11.8%. This batch of grain was not shipped out in time and was stored for a long time. In addition, the climate was not good, and the humidity increased, causing it to heat up. Thanks to timely spreading and airing by the processing plant, no accident occurred at that time. However, when the moisture content was tested on April 29 when loading the ship, it had reached 16%, exceeding the safety standard, and should not have been shipped out according to regulations. That night, the grain depot keeper Rao Yuzhen reported the situation to Zhu Huanzong, deputy director of the storage and transportation station of our bureau. Zhu Huanzong replied irresponsibly: "The rice is already on the ship, so let it be shipped out. The moisture content record on the test ticket can be changed to 13.8%." This batch of rice was shipped out in this way. When the grain arrived in Zhenjiang on May 10, most of it had deteriorated, and the color had turned greenish-black. The Zhenjiang grain receiving unit immediately telegraphed our bureau to inform us. Our bureau sent Zhu Huanzong to Zhenjiang to negotiate with the receiving unit and take measures such as re-processing, spreading, and ventilation. As a result, the total value of lost rice and other expenses was about 30 million yuan. The main responsibility for this rice loss accident lies with Zhu Huanzong, deputy director of the storage and transportation station of our bureau; our bureau has reported to the Wannian County Supervisory Committee for approval to give him the punishment of dismissal. Grain depot keeper Rao Yuzhen did not adhere to principles and arbitrarily revised the test results based on Zhu Huanzong's erroneous opinions, which was also wrong, and this bureau has also decided to give him a warning.

### 不负责任的工作态度使国家粮食遭受了损失

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不负责任的工作态度使国家粮食遭受了损失
      编者按：江苏省粮食厅接运办事处读者曹宪、陈建华来信反映：今年四、五月间由江西省万年县发运江苏省镇江市的两千五百包（五十万斤）大米，大部变质，温度都在摄氏三十度以上；虽经接粮单位抢救，但国家已遭受不少损失。后经本报调查，证明读者揭发的情况是真实的。造成这次粮食损失事故的原因，是某些干部对待国家财产采取了不负责任的态度。现将万年县粮食局的复信发表在后面，希望各地粮食部门接受这个教训，教育干部以高度负责的态度对待粮食调运保管工作。
    万年县粮食局答复：我局调运江苏镇江的五十万斤大米，在四月十八日就加工完成并全部装包待运。加工时经我局石镇街二粮库化验，水份是百分之十一点八。这批粮食没有及时运出，存放较久，加之气候不好，湿气增大，以致发热。由于加工厂及时摊晾，当时没有引起事故。但到四月二十九日装船时化验，水份已达百分之十六，超过了安全标准，按规定不应调出。当天晚上粮库保管员饶玉珍将情况告诉我局储运站副站长朱焕宗，朱焕宗竟不负责任地答复说：“米已经上了船，还是让它运出去，化验票上的水份记录可改为百分之十三点八。”这批大米就这样运出去了。五月十日粮食到达镇江后，大部分已经变质，颜色变成绿黑色。镇江接粮单位马上来电通知我局。我局派朱焕宗到镇江和接粮单位协商，采取从新加工、摊晾、通风等办法处理，结果损失大米和其它开支的总值约三千万元。这次大米损失事故之所以发生，我局储运站副站长朱焕宗要负主要责任；我局已报请万年县监察委员会批准，给以撤职处分。粮库保管员饶玉珍不坚持原则，根据朱焕宗的错误意见，任意修改化验结果，也是不对的，本局亦决定给以警告处分。
