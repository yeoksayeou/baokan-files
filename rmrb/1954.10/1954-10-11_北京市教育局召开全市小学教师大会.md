    The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau convened a citywide elementary school teachers conference on October 9th. Over 6,000 teachers from urban and some suburban areas attended the conference.

    Sun Guoliang, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Education Bureau, delivered a report at the conference. The report first pointed out: Since the implementation of the "Decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Improving the Quality of Primary and Secondary Education in Beijing," primary schools have achieved certain results. Teachers' enthusiasm has generally increased, and work plans centered on improving the quality of education have been formulated. School administrative leaders and teachers have shown many new aspects in focusing on teaching. The report criticized the current impetuous mood of elementary school teachers in seeking quantity and speed in improving the quality of education, and pointed out that it is wrong to simply emphasize objective reasons or treat the work of improving the quality of education with an individualistic attitude.

    The report then pointed out: Teachers in various schools should correctly understand the decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on improving the quality of primary and secondary education in Beijing, unite to improve teaching methods, help each other, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. School leaders should attach importance to and strengthen teaching leadership and political and ideological leadership of teachers, and take effective measures to improve teachers' professional and political-ideological levels.

    The report concluded that in the future, a positive and steady approach should be adopted to realistically improve the quality of elementary education based on the actual conditions of the schools; and attention should be paid to implementing the policy of all-round development, improving students' knowledge level, paying attention to students' ideology and health, and cultivating students to become well-rounded talents.

    Since the summer vacation this year, elementary school teachers in Beijing have successively studied the "Decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Improving the Quality of Primary and Secondary Education in Beijing." After the start of the school year, they actively carried out teaching inspections and various tasks centered on improving the quality of education to formulate school work plans. The formulation of school work plans and key class teacher work plans for various elementary schools will be completed in mid-October. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京市教育局召开全市小学教师大会
    北京市人民政府教育局在十月九日召开了全市小学教师大会。参加大会的有城区教师和郊区部分教师共六千多人。
    北京市人民政府教育局副局长孙国梁在会上作了报告。报告首先指出：各小学自执行“中国共产党北京市委员会关于提高北京市中小学教育质量的决定”以来，已取得了一定的成绩。教师积极性普遍提高，制订了以提高教育质量为中心的工作计划；各校行政领导和教师在面向教学方面出现了不少新气象。报告对目前小学教师在提高教育质量工作中求多、求快的急躁情绪作了批判，并指出那些单纯强调客观原因或以个人主义的态度来对待提高教育质量工作是不对的。
    报告接着指出：各校教师应正确理解中共北京市委关于提高北京市中小学教育质量的决定，团结一致改进教学方法，互相帮助，展开批评与自我批评；学校领导应重视和加强对教师的教学领导及政治思想领导，采取有效措施提高教师的业务水平和政治思想水平。
    报告最后指出，今后应采取积极稳步的方针，根据学校的实际情况，实事求是地提高小学教育质量；并应注意贯彻全面发展的方针，提高学生的知识水平，重视学生的思想和健康情况，培养学生成为全面发展的人材。
    北京市各小学教师从今年暑期开始先后学习了“中国共产党北京市委员会关于提高北京市中小学教育质量的决定”，开学后，积极进行了教学检查以及以提高教育质量为中心制订学校工作计划的各项工作。各小学制订学校工作计划、重点班班主任工作计划工作将于十月中旬完成。（新华社）
