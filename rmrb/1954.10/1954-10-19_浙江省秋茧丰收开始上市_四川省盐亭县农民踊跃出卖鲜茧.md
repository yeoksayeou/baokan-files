　　Zhejiang Province Autumn Silkworm Cocoons Harvest Begins to Enter the Market
　　Sichuan Province Yanting County Farmers Enthusiastically Sell Fresh Cocoons

    Zhejiang Province's autumn cocoons have been put on the market, and hundreds of cocoon collection stations across the province have successively started purchasing.
    This year, many areas in Zhejiang Province have had a bumper harvest of autumn cocoons. The amount of cocoons collected per silkworm egg in Hangzhou City increased by four catties compared to the original plan; in Hang County and Hangzhou City, the average agricultural production cooperatives produced around forty catties per silkworm egg.
    To support national industrial construction, the vast number of silkworm farmers are enthusiastically selling their fresh cocoons to the state. In Changan and Douqiao in Haining County, the amount of autumn cocoons purchased by cocoon collection stations has already exceeded the original plan.
    Autumn cocoons in Yanting County, Sichuan Province, have been put on the market. This autumn, silkworm farmers have sold all their fresh cocoons to the state. As of the end of September, the county has purchased more than 630,000 kilograms of fresh cocoons, and it is estimated that a total of more than 650,000 kilograms can be purchased, which is more than 180,000 kilograms more than in the autumn of last year. The average yield per single sheet of silkworm eggs is 16 kilograms, an increase of 12% compared to the 12.5 kilograms per single sheet in the autumn of last year. In addition to the 98 agricultural production cooperatives that are collectively managed, the county has also organized 7,031 young silkworm joint rearing groups and 2,724 full-course joint rearing groups, organizing a total of 31,707 silkworm farming households. Because they have effectively relied on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, most silkworm farmers have conscientiously implemented production-increasing methods such as "disinfection and disease prevention, sparse silkworms and diligent feeding." The Wang Weizheng joint group in Jinxing Township collectively raised six and a half sheets of silkworm eggs and produced 169 kilograms of cocoons, achieving a high yield of 26 kilograms per single sheet.

    浙江省秋茧丰收开始上市
    四川省盐亭县农民踊跃出卖鲜茧
    浙江省秋茧已经上市，全省上百个收茧站先后开秤收购。
    今年浙江省不少地区秋茧丰收。杭州市每张蚕种的收茧量比原计划增产四市斤；杭县、杭州市一般农业生产合作社每张蚕种的产量都在四十斤左右。
    广大蚕农为了支援国家工业建设，踊跃地把鲜茧卖给国家。海宁县长安、钭桥两地收茧站收购秋茧的数量，都已经超过原订计划。
    四川省盐亭县秋茧已经上市，今秋，蚕农们把所有的鲜茧都全部卖给了国家，截至九月底，全县已收购了鲜茧六十三万多公斤，估计共能收购六十五万多公斤，比去年秋季多收购十八万多公斤。平均每单张产茧十六公斤，较去秋每单张产茧十二公斤半提高了百分之十二。全县除九十八个农业生产合作社是集体经营外，还组织了七千零三十一个稚蚕共育组和二千七百二十四个全程共育组，组织起来的蚕农共三万一千七百零七户。由于切实依靠了互助合作组织，大部分蚕农就确实地贯彻了“消毒防病、稀蚕勤喂”等增产办法。金星乡王维正联组集体饲养的六张半蚕种，就产茧一百六十九公斤，达到每单张产茧二十六公斤的高额产量。
