    Comprehensive Construction Begins on the Baisha Irrigation Canal Project in Henan Province

    The first phase of the Baisha Irrigation Canal project in Henan Province has entered the stage of full-scale construction. To prepare for the comprehensive commencement of work and to create experience to guide the overall project, Baisha No. 1 Drop Structure, Houjialou Continuous Drop Structure, and No. 3 Drop Structure were started as early as July. The stone materials required for the project have been supplied by the Jueshan Quarry, which has produced more than 6,000 cubic meters of stone since May. The necessary steel bars, timber, cement, and other materials from other locations have been successively transported to the site, while local materials such as lime and stone have also been purchased and quarried. Transportation roads in various work sections have been generally repaired and paved, and 250 ox carts and pushcarts have been organized for transportation. As of late October, a total of twelve large and small structures have been completed, and twenty-seven are under construction with stone masonry and foundation excavation underway, having basically completed the key construction tasks for September and October. Full-scale construction will commence at the end of October. The project from Baisha to the Gushui River section can be completed this winter, and water will be released in the coming spring.

    The Baisha Irrigation Canal is an innovative project in New China that uses reservoirs for irrigation, drawing water from the Baisha Reservoir to irrigate farmland. This irrigation area extends from Baisha to Yingqiao Town, covering a length of approximately 60 kilometers, bordered by mountains in the southwest and the Ying River in the northeast, with a maximum width of 7 kilometers and a total area of approximately 180 square kilometers. After the entire irrigation project is completed, it can control the irrigation of more than 230,000 mu of land, potentially increasing grain production by more than 20 million jin per year.

    河南省白沙灌溉渠工程开始全面施工
    河南省白沙灌溉渠第一期工程已进入全面施工阶段。为了给全面开工作好准备，并创造经验指导全面工程，白沙一号跌水、侯家楼连续跌水和三号跌水早在七月份就开始施工。工程所需料石已由崛山石场供应，自五月份以来，该场已打石料六千多方。所需钢筋、木料、水泥等外地材料，都已陆续运到，本地材料如白灰石料等也分别购到和开打出来。各工段运输道路已普遍修铺完竣，并已组织牛车、架子车二百五十辆进行运输。到十月下旬止，共已完成大小建筑物十二座，正在砌石、挖基的二十七座，已基本完成了九、十月份的重点施工任务。十月底即开始全面施工。从白沙到谷水河段的工程今年冬季可以完成，明春开始放水。
    白沙灌溉渠是引白沙水库的蓄水来灌溉农田，是新中国用水库进行灌溉的首创工程。这一灌区自白沙起至颍桥镇止，全长约六十公里，西南依山，东北濒颍河，最宽处有七公里，总面积约有一百八十多平方公里。整个灌溉工程完成后，可控制全部灌溉面积二十三万多亩，每年约可增产粮食二千余万斤。　（丁耒章、孔令华）
