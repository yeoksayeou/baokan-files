Xinhua News Agency, October 7th dispatch from Vietnam: Two months ago, on August 6th, hostilities ceased throughout Laos. At the end of August, representatives of both sides of the Lao Joint Armistice Commission reached an agreement on issues such as the separation of opposing forces, temporary garrison areas and demarcation lines, routes and time limits for troop withdrawals, and other matters.

Regarding the separation of opposing forces, Lao fighting units and Vietnamese volunteers promptly carried out the separation work after the ceasefire. However, the French Union forces and the Lao Royal Armed Forces took actions that violated the armistice agreement. According to incomplete figures, they have dispatched troops to another twelve strongholds to expand their occupied areas. They even airdropped paratroopers to occupy Pong Nou, located 20 kilometers northwest of Phongsaly in an area where Lao fighting units were regrouping.

Regarding the regrouping and withdrawal of troops, Lao fighting units and Vietnamese volunteers, regardless of various difficulties, traveled through forests from remote areas in central and southern Laos, traversing a thousand kilometers, and arrived at the regrouping areas on time. While the troops were moving north, certain distorted propaganda claimed that Lao fighting units were forcing Lao people and taking them to the regrouping areas. This is a completely unfounded fabrication. The Lao fighting units are the people's army, and it never forcibly conscripts soldiers, but the number of people volunteering to join the army has been increasing.

Regarding the exchange of prisoners of war, Lao fighting units and Vietnamese volunteers have already handed over 200 European and African prisoners of war to the French Union forces. Another 150 European and African prisoners of war will be handed over to the other side at Cen San on October 10th. At the same time, the French Union forces are still detaining 348 prisoners of war from the Lao fighting units and Vietnamese volunteers.

In addition to occupying twelve new strongholds, the French Union forces and the Lao Royal Armed Forces are secretly assisting some rogues and bandits disguised as Lao Royal Armed Forces to rob and massacre the people, and are trying to reoccupy some areas within the regrouping areas of the Lao fighting units. The French army and the Lao Royal Armed Forces have also shamelessly ambushed and shot at Lao fighting units and Vietnamese volunteers.

In a report submitted to the International Supervisory and Control Commission on September 27th, the delegation of Lao fighting units and Vietnamese volunteers strongly protested against these actions by the French army and the Lao Royal Armed Forces that violated the armistice agreement, and demanded that they immediately cease these actions.

Significant achievements have been made in the two months of implementing the armistice agreement. Currently, Lao fighting units are on their way to the regrouping areas in Sam Neua Province and Phongsaly Province, and Vietnamese volunteers are also returning to Vietnam in order to complete the regrouping and withdrawal of troops by the upcoming November 20, 1954. This date is also the date for the complete withdrawal of the French Union forces from Laos.

Although the Lao people are encouraged by these initial victories, they remain highly vigilant against the conspiracies of those who sabotage the armistice. They resolutely implement the armistice agreement and demand that the other side also implement it sincerely in order to guarantee the establishment of an independent, unified, democratic, and peaceful Laos.

### 寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员  两个月来严格遵守并执行老挝停战协定

    寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员
    两个月来严格遵守并执行老挝停战协定
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社七日讯：两个月以前，八月六日，老挝全境战事停止。老挝联合停战委员会双方代表在八月底就双方敌对部队的隔离问题，临时驻军地区和分界线以及撤退军队的路线和时限问题及其他问题达成了协议。
    关于隔离敌对部队问题，寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员在停火以后已迅速进行了敌对部队的隔离工作。但法兰西联邦部队和老挝王国武装部队，却作出了违反停战协定的行动，根据不完全的数字，他们已派遣军队到另外十二个据点去扩大他们的占领地区。他们曾空降伞兵去占领寮国战斗部队重新集结地区的丰沙里西北二十公里的磅怒。
    在部队的重新集结和撤退问题方面，寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员不顾种种困难，从老挝中部和南部偏远地区穿过森林，横越一千公里，准时地到集结区会合。在部队向北转移的时候，某些歪曲宣传吵嚷说，寮国战斗部队逼迫老挝人民并把他们带到集结区，这是完全没有根据的捏造。寮国战斗部队是人民的军队，它从来不强迫征兵，可是那些自愿参军的人数一直在增加。
    在交换战俘方面，寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员早已移交给法兰西联邦部队二百名欧非籍战俘。另有一百五十名欧非籍战俘将在十月十日在岑山移交给对方。同时，法兰西联邦部队仍然拘留着寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员的三百四十八名战俘。
    法兰西联邦部队和老挝王国部队除了盘踞着十二个新据点以外，并且暗中帮助伪装老挝王国部队的若干恶棍和匪徒去抢劫和屠杀人民，并设法重新占领寮国战斗部队重新集结地区内的若干地方。法军和老挝王国部队并且无耻地伏击和开枪射击寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员。
    寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员代表团在九月二十七日向国际监督和监察委员会提出的报告里，强烈抗议法军和老挝王国部队的这些破坏停战协定的行动，并要求他们立即停止这些行动。
    在执行停战协定的两个月中间，已获得显著的成就。目前，寮国战斗部队正在开往桑怒省和丰沙里省的重新集结地区的途中，越南志愿人员也正在返回越南，以便在即将到来的一九五四年十一月二十日完成军队的重新集结和撤退工作。这一天也是法兰西联邦部队从老挝撤退完毕的日期。
    老挝人民虽然为这些初步的胜利所鼓舞，但是对于破坏停战的分子们的阴谋仍然保持着高度的警惕，他们坚决地执行停战协定，并且要求对方也同样地诚意执行，以便保证建立一个独立、统一、民主和和平的老挝。
