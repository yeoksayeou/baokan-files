Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, October 24th: TASS reports that the Executive Committee of the Dutch Peace Committee has issued a declaration calling on the Dutch people to protest the new plans to rearm West Germany.

The declaration states that France's veto of the "European Defence Community" treaty has made people more convinced that the German question and the European security issues closely related to it can be resolved through negotiations between the East and West. However, the new plan to arm Germany, in the form of a changed 1948 Brussels Treaty, is now threatening us again.

The declaration continues, the Germany which will join the North Atlantic Organization and the Brussels Treaty Organization is the same Germany that invaded its neighbors twice in twenty-five years. …

The Executive Committee of the Dutch Peace Committee calls on all Dutch people to declare to their parliamentary representatives their firm protest against this plan.

The Executive Committee of the Dutch Peace Committee advocates negotiations between East and West on the German question.

Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, October 25th: TASS reports that Danish peace advocates held a meeting in Copenhagen on the 24th. The meeting appealed to the Danish government, hoping that it would support the Soviet Union's proposal on the 23rd to convene a four-power conference to discuss the peaceful reunification of Germany.
