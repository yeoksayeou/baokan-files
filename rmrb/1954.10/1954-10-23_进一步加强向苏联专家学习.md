    Further Strengthen Learning from Soviet Experts
    Recently, the Ministry of Heavy Industry convened a work conference of Soviet experts, giving high praise to the remarkable achievements made by Soviet experts in the system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. With a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, the conference examined the learning situation of the ministry's staff from Soviet experts, discussed and stipulated methods and approaches to further strengthen learning from Soviet experts. In the past few years, Soviet experts have imparted Soviet advanced experience to the cadres, technicians, and the broad masses of workers and farmers in various departments of our country with selfless labor enthusiasm, and improved their professional and technical levels, thereby promoting the victorious advancement of our socialist construction cause. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude and respect to the Soviet experts – the beloved teachers and helpful friends who help our people build a new life.
    Correctly learning and applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is an important factor in successfully completing our country's construction tasks. In February 1953, when our country began its first Five-Year Plan, Comrade Mao Zedong issued a call to the people of the whole country: "We are going to carry out great national construction. The work before us is arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether they are members of the Communist Party or not, old cadres or new cadres, technical personnel, intellectuals, or the masses of workers and peasants, all must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only learn the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch a nationwide upsurge in learning from the Soviet Union to build our country." Recently, Comrade Zhou Enlai said at the reception held by the Soviet Ambassador to China for the Soviet government delegation: "The Chinese people are currently striving to carry out the first Five-Year Plan. In order to ensure the success of this construction, we must, as Comrade Mao Zedong has often called for, honestly and diligently learn from the advanced experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. Countless facts in the past five years have shown that the glorious example of the great Soviet socialist construction is illuminating our path forward, and we must do a good job in completing the glorious task of learning from the Soviet Union." Facts have proved that learning from Soviet experts is the most practical and effective method of learning from the advanced experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. Because Soviet experts are not only the transmitters of Soviet advanced experience, but also their transmission is based on the specific conditions of our country and the needs of our country's specific construction work.
    In the past few years, various business departments in our country have achieved many successes in the process of learning from Soviet experts. Thanks to the enthusiastic help and guidance of the experts, we have solved many problems that we could not solve ourselves, and many cadres and technicians have improved their professional and technical levels in the learning process. However, these achievements are far from meeting the requirements of our national construction cause, and at the same time, there are still serious shortcomings in the learning process in some departments.
    First of all, some cadres have not firmly established the idea of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Some people are satisfied with their past old experiences and old knowledge, and lack enthusiasm for learning new things; some people become proud after making a little progress in their work or learning a little from Soviet experts, and are unwilling to continue learning; some people inappropriately exaggerate the difficulties in learning and lack the spirit to overcome difficulties. Some people, due to their bureaucratic work style, are busy every day and cannot grasp the key issues in their work. They also want to learn from experts, but "can't find the time"; and because experts pay attention to the key issues in their work, these people are busy with daily trivial matters, and the learning effect is reduced due to the different focus. Due to the above reasons, these cadres cannot play a leading role in learning, and often do more general mobilization but less specific organization work. At the same time, since they are insufficiently aware, they certainly cannot correct the doubts of some technical personnel whose thinking has not been completely transformed about the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and therefore cannot implement the task of learning from the Soviet Union in specific work. It can be seen from this that further strengthening learning from Soviet experts is a process of ideological struggle, a process of overcoming various erroneous ideas such as pride and conservatism with correct ideas, a process of overcoming bureaucratic work styles with a scientific work style, a process of self-transformation and self-improvement for cadres and technicians, and a process of training their innovative spirit and overcoming difficulties. Therefore, only when the leading cadres of each department regard the work of learning from Soviet experts as an important aspect of their leadership activities, and only when the party organizations of each department closely care about this work and regard learning from Soviet experts as one of the main contents of their regular ideological and political work, can they lead all personnel to more appreciate the incomparably rich treasures brought to us by the Soviet experts, and strive to learn it, promote it, and make it powerfully promote the advancement of our country's construction cause.
    The shortcomings of incomplete and unsystematic learning from Soviet experts must be overcome. The learning in some departments did not strictly formulate plans, learning whatever comes to mind, and the knowledge learned is fragmented and not systematic, and therefore not solid. One of our tasks in learning from Soviet experts is to cultivate a group of Chinese experts who can master the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in all walks of life. The current learning situation cannot complete this task. Therefore, the comprehensiveness and systematicness of learning must be emphasized. Soviet experts have put forward many valuable suggestions for our work, and we have also improved many jobs with the help of experts, but many things are often known but not why, and we are not armed in theory, so we cannot cultivate our own ability to solve problems independently. Any department has three aspects of knowledge, namely, theoretical policy, science and technology, and organization and management. To cultivate Chinese experts, it is necessary to learn these three aspects of knowledge, none of which is indispensable. Now all departments are learning according to the principle of "do what you do, learn what you learn," which is completely correct. The problem is how to make this learning more strictly planned, make the results of learning more complete, and stipulate the learning progress according to the learning requirements, and ensure that a certain content is learned within a certain period of time. In order to train Chinese experts, each department must transfer some promising staff, reduce their daily work, so that they have sufficient time to learn from experts, and help and improve other staff through them. The leading cadres of each department must make up their minds in this regard, otherwise it will not be possible to complete the task of cultivating their own experts.
    In the past few years, Soviet experts have put forward many valuable suggestions to our business departments, which have had a significant impact on the work, and some departments have changed the face of their work due to the implementation of these suggestions. However, there are still many shortcomings in the implementation of expert suggestions. The most important shortcoming is that there is insufficient serious research on expert suggestions, and no full and active efforts are made to create conditions for the implementation of these suggestions. Soviet experts' suggestions are simple and complex; difficult and easy. The situation in many departments shows that simple suggestions are implemented faster, and complex suggestions are implemented slower; suggestions for solving current problems are implemented faster, and suggestions for fundamental reforms are implemented slower; suggestions on technical aspects are implemented more, and suggestions on organization and management aspects are implemented less. It must be affirmed that the suggestions of Soviet experts are the embodiment of the advanced experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and at the same time, they are put forward based on the specific conditions of China, so they are correct in principle. However, some suggestions must be seriously studied and learned by Chinese staff, and thoroughly understood its spirit, and further specified in detail, in order to facilitate implementation. Some major suggestions must be implemented after creating the necessary conditions. For example, some major suggestions on industry must be implemented after a series of preparations have been made in design, construction, investment, and cadres. Due to the shortcomings and errors of our staff, some suggestions are often mechanically implemented without careful study and learning, so that the due effect cannot be obtained; some major suggestions are shelved for a long time because the conditions for implementation have not been created, and these errors have caused major losses to the country. In order to enable the suggestions of Soviet experts to have a greater impact on our country's construction cause, in addition to correcting the above-mentioned phenomena, all suggestions that can be implemented immediately should be issued in the form of orders or instructions from the department, and the subordinate units should be responsible for their earnest implementation; all effective suggestions should be vigorously promoted in various ways, so that the achievements of a department in learning from the Soviet Union become shared by other units of the same nature, so as not to waste the strength of Soviet experts on problems that have already been solved.
    Learning from Soviet experts and implementing expert suggestions is a serious and complex task. This is an innovative work. The smooth progress of this innovative work requires overcoming all kinds of non-socialist ideas in various personnel, requires the close cooperation of all relevant parties, and requires necessary ideological and organizational work to overcome various obstacles and difficulties. To complete such a task, the leading cadres of each department must personally do it, and the leading institutions of each department must appropriately arrange the various problems that occur in this work on their agenda. In addition, there must be a special work organization as an assistant to the leadership. This work organization can conduct regular supervision and inspection of the work of the department's staff in learning from experts, providing experts with business materials and introducing business conditions, and implementing and promoting expert suggestions. With such a work organization, it is possible to learn from experts and realize expert suggestions in a more organized and planned way.
    We hope that all departments can earnestly examine the situation of learning from Soviet experts and implementing expert suggestions, summarize past experiences, stipulate future methods, and better learn from the rich experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union.

### 进一步加强向苏联专家学习

    进一步加强向苏联专家学习
    最近重工业部召开了苏联专家工作会议，对于苏联专家在重工业部系统内所作的卓著成效的工作给予了崇高的评价，并且以批评和自我批评的精神，检查了该部职工向苏联专家学习的情况，讨论并规定了进一步加强向苏联专家学习的方法和途径。几年来苏联专家们以忘我的劳动热情，向我国各部门的机关干部、技术人员以及广大的工人和农民群众传授了苏联先进经验，提高了他们的业务水平和技术水平，从而推动了我国社会主义建设事业胜利前进。我们谨向苏联专家们——帮助我国人民建设新生活的敬爱的良师益友，表示由衷的感谢和敬意。
    正确地学习和运用苏联的先进经验，是胜利完成我国各项建设任务的一个重要因素。毛泽东同志在一九五三年二月，即我国开始第一个五年计划的时候，曾向全国人民发出号召：“我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”最近，周恩来同志在苏联驻我国大使为招待苏联政府代表团所举行的招待会上说：“中国人民目前正在努力进行第一个五年建设计划。为了保证这种建设的成功，必须如毛泽东同志所经常号召的那样，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，学习苏联的社会主义建设的先进经验。苏联的今天就是我们的明天。五年来的无数事实都表明了伟大的苏联社会主义建设的光辉榜样，正照耀着我们前进的道路，我们一定要很好地完成向苏联学习的光荣任务。”事实证明，向苏联专家学习乃是学习苏联社会主义建设的先进经验的最实际的最有效的方法。因为苏联专家不仅是苏联先进经验的传授者，而且他们的传授是根据着我国的具体情况，根据着我国各项具体建设工作的需要来进行的。
    几年来，我国各业务部门在向苏联专家学习的过程中已获得了许多成绩。由于专家们热诚的帮助和指导，我们解决了许多自己无法解决的问题，不少干部和技术人员在学习中提高了自己的业务和技术水平。但这些成绩还远远不能满足我们国家建设事业的要求，同时若干部门在学习中还存在着严重的缺点。
    首先是一部分干部还没有巩固地树立学习苏联先进经验的思想。有的人员满足于自己过去的一点旧经验和旧知识，对新鲜事物缺乏学习的热情；有的人员工作稍有成绩或向苏联专家学到了一点，就骄傲起来，不愿继续学习；有的人员不适当地夸大学习中的困难，缺乏克服困难的精神。有的人员由于自己的事务主义作风，每天忙忙碌碌，抓不住业务中的关键问题，他们也想向专家学习，但
  “找不到时间”；又由于专家注意的是业务中的关键问题，这些人员所忙的却是日常琐事，因着眼点不同，就减低了学习的效果。由于上述原因，这些干部在学习中不能起带头的作用，往往一般号召做的多，具体组织工作做的少。同时，自己既然认识不足，当然不能纠正某些思想尚未完全改造的技术人员对苏联先进经验的怀疑，因而就不能使学习苏联的任务在具体业务中得到贯彻。由此可见，进一步加强向苏联专家学习，是一个思想斗争的过程，是以正确思想克服骄傲、保守等各种错误思想的过程，是以科学的工作作风去克服事务主义作风的过程，是干部和技术人员自我改造和自我提高的过程，是他们锻炼革新精神和克服困难的过程。因此，只有各部门的领导干部把向苏联专家学习的工作当做自己领导活动的一个重要方面，只有各部门的党的组织密切关心这个工作，把向苏联专家学习作为自己经常的思想政治工作主要内容之一，才能带领全体人员更加珍贵苏联专家们所带给我们的无比丰富的财宝，并努力学习它，推广它，使它有力地推动我国的建设事业前进。
    向苏联专家学习中不全面和不系统的缺点必须克服。某些部门的学习没有严格制定计划，想起什么就学什么，学到的知识是零碎的，不成体系的，因而是不巩固的。我们向苏联专家学习的任务之一，是要在各行各业中培养一批能掌握苏联先进经验的中国自己的专家。目前的学习情况是不能完成这一任务的。因此，必须强调学习的全面性和系统性。苏联专家对我们的工作提出了许多宝贵的建议，我们也在专家的帮助下改进了许多工作，但许多事情往往是知其然而不知其所以然，没有从理论上武装起来，因而就不能培养自己独立解决问题的能力。任何一个部门都有三个方面的知识，即理论政策方面、科学技术方面和组织管理方面。要培养中国自己的专家，就必须学到这三方面的知识，缺一不可。现在各部门都是按照“做什么、学什么”的原则进行学习，这是完全对的。问题在于怎样使这个学习带有更严格的计划性，使学习的成果带有更大的完整性，并根据学习的要求，规定学习进度，保证在一定的时间内学完一定内容的问题。为了培养中国自己的专家，各部门必须抽调一些有培养前途的工作人员，减少他们的日常工作，使他们有充足时间向专家学习，并通过他们去帮助和提高别的工作人员。各部门的领导干部必须在这方面下定决心，否则是不能完成培养自己的专家的任务的。
    苏联专家几年来对我们各业务部门提出了许多宝贵的建议，对工作发生了重大的作用，有的部门因这些建议的执行而改变了工作的面貌。但在执行专家建议方面，还有不少的缺点。最主要的缺点是对专家建议认真研究不够，没有充分积极地为执行这些建议去创造条件。苏联专家的建议有简单的，有复杂的；有难办的，有容易办的。许多部门的情况表明，简单的建议执行得较快，复杂的建议执行得较慢；解决当前问题的建议执行得较快，带根本性改革的建议执行得较慢；技术方面的建议执行得较多，组织管理方面的建议执行得较少。必须肯定，苏联专家的建议是苏联社会主义建设先进经验的体现，同时又是根据中国具体情况提出的，因而原则上是正确的。但有的建议必须经过中国工作人员认真的研究和学习，融会贯通它的精神实质，并在细节上进一步加以具体化，才能便于执行。有些较重大的建议，必须创造必要的条件以后，才能执行。如关于工业上的某些重大建议，就是必须在设计、施工、投资、干部等方面做好一系列的准备工作以后才能执行的。由于我们的工作人员的缺点和错误，往往有些建议未经仔细研究和学习就机械地加以执行，以致不能获得应有的效果；某些较重大的建议则因没有创造执行的条件而长期被搁置，这些错误都给国家造成了重大的损失。为使苏联专家的建议能在我国建设事业中发生更大的作用，除了纠正上述的现象以外，一切能立即执行的建议都应以本部门的命令或指示的形式下达，责成所属各单位认真执行；一切行之有效的建议都应以各种方式大力推广，务使一个部门学习苏联所得的成就变为其他同性质的单位所共有，不使苏联专家在已经解决了的问题上浪费力量。
    向苏联专家学习和执行专家建议是一种严重的、复杂的任务。这是一种革新的工作。这种革新工作的顺利进行要求克服各种人员中的形形色色的非社会主义思想，要求各有关方面的密切配合，要求进行必要的思想工作和组织工作，克服各种障碍和困难。要完成这样的任务，就必须各部门的领导干部亲自动手，必须各部门的领导机构将这一工作中所发生的各种问题恰当地排列在自己的日程上。此外，还必须有专门的工作机构作为领导的助手。这个工作机构可以对本部门工作人员向专家学习、供给专家业务资料和介绍业务情况、执行和推广专家建议等工作进行经常的督促和检查。有了这样的工作机构，就能够更加有组织、有计划地向专家学习和实现专家的建议。
    我们希望各个部门都能够认真地检查向苏联专家学习和执行专家建议的情况，总结过去的经验，规定今后的办法，更好地学习苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验。
