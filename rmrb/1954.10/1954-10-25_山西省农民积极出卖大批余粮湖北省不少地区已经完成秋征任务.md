    Shanxi Province Peasants Actively Sell Large Quantities of Surplus Grain
    Many Areas in Hubei Province Have Completed the Autumn Grain Tax
    Peasants in various parts of Shanxi Province are actively selling their surplus grain to the state to support national construction and people in disaster areas. Currently, the surplus grain sold by peasants to the state in various parts of the province has exceeded 11.7 million jin.
    Before and after the autumn harvest, peasants in many areas enthusiastically discussed the significance of selling surplus grain to the state as soon as possible. Zhang Lianzi, a peasant from Fenghuang Township, Jing Le County, said during the discussion: "In 1951, we suffered a famine here, and the government transported cloth from Hebei and rice from Hunan and Hubei to support us; this year, they are suffering from disasters, and it is only right for us to support them." The peasants in this township quickly sold more than 6,700 jin of surplus grain. Many peasants in Shuangze Township, Tunliu County, said: "Peasants all over the world are one family, and mutual support is only right." "We should try our best to save food and support national construction and our peasant brothers in the disaster areas." Before September 25, they had already sold more than 1,200 jin of surplus grain to the state. The members of the Song Xiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengyang Village, Changzi County, in order to sell their surplus grain to the state as soon as possible, harvested 35 mu of early-maturing millet according to the maturity of the crops in the cooperative. After the millet was harvested, it was immediately distributed to households, milled into rice, and sent to the state grain purchasing station. Peasants in Shihui Township, Luan County, proposed to "harvest, thresh, dry, and sell at the same time" to strive to sell large quantities of surplus grain to the state as soon as possible.
    Peasants in various parts of Hubei Province are enthusiastically paying their patriotic agricultural tax. According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of September, the total amount of public grain stored in the province has exceeded 629 million jin. Many places, such as the Yichang Special District, have completed the autumn agricultural tax collection task.
    In order to support national industrialization, support the liberation of Taiwan, and support the people in disaster areas, peasants in non-disaster areas have quickly paid their agricultural tax after a bumper harvest this year. After organizing the grain delivery team, Qinglin Township, District 1, Songzi County, began delivering grain the next day. Wang Kaiju, a peasant from Xinsheng Township, District 11, Fang County, quickly dried and winnowed the corn after harvesting it, and prepared to pay the public grain. He said: "The public grain must be dry, clean, and full, so that the country can store it well." Chunshan and Jiangjia Townships in Songhe District, Jingshan County, delivered all 205,000 jin of public grain to the granary in two mornings.
    Grain departments in various places have long prepared for receiving public grain. Yichang and Enshi Special Districts began repairing warehouses and disinfecting them in August. More than 100,000 pieces of equipment in Luotian, Huangpi, Macheng and other counties have been sun-dried, knocked, and disinfected. In order to take care of the health of the peasants who deliver grain, tea stations, medical stations, and warehouse safety equipment have also been prepared in various places. In Yingshan County alone, forty-three tea stations, twenty-one medical stations, and twenty-four rest sheds have been set up in four locations including Chengguan and Maping. Caihe District in Xishui County also established a mobile treatment team.

    山西省农民积极出卖大批余粮
    湖北省不少地区已经完成秋征任务
    山西省各地农民积极把余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设和灾区人民。目前，该省各地农民卖给国家的余粮，已有一千一百七十多万斤。
    许多地区的农民在秋收前后热烈讨论了早把余粮卖给国家的意义。静乐县凤凰乡农民张脸子在讨论时说：“一九五一年咱们这里遭了灾荒，政府从河北运来土布，从湖南、湖北等地调来大米，支援咱们；今年他们那里受了灾，咱们支援他们是理所当然的事。”这个乡的农民很快就卖出余粮六千七百多斤。屯留县双泽乡许多农民说：“天下农民是一家，互相支援理应当。”“咱们应当尽量节约粮食，支援国家建设和灾区的农民兄弟。”他们在九月二十五日以前，就已经卖给国家一千二百多斤余粮。长子县城阳村宋喜全农业生产合作社的社员们为了早把余粮卖给国家，根据社里田禾成熟情况，先割早熟谷三十五亩，谷子打下以后，立刻分配到户碾成米，送往国家购粮站。潞安县史回乡农民提出要“边收、边打、边晒、边卖”，争取把大批余粮早日卖给国家。
    湖北省各地农民踊跃缴纳爱国公粮。据不完全统计，到九月底止，全省入库的公粮已经有六亿二千九百多万斤。宜昌专区等许多地方已经完成了秋季农业税征收任务。
      为了支援国家工业化，支援解放台湾，支援灾区人民，非灾区的农民今年获得丰收以后，都迅速缴纳农业税。松滋县第一区青林乡组织好送粮队以后，第二天就开始送粮。房县第十一区新生乡农民王开举收割玉米以后，很快就晒干扬净，准备交公粮。他说：“交公粮一定要干、净、饱满，国家才好保存。”京山县宋河区春山、江家二乡两个早晨就把二十万五千斤公粮全部送入了粮库。
    各地粮食部门早就作了接收公粮的准备工作。宜昌、恩施两专区从八月份开始，就修整仓房，进行消毒工作。罗田、黄陂、麻城等县经过曝晒、敲打、消毒的器材有十万多件。为了照顾送粮农民的健康，各地还准备了茶水站、医药站和仓库安全设备等。仅应山县城关、马坪等四个点，就已设置茶水站四十三个，医疗站二十一个，休息棚二十四个。浠水县蔡河区还成立了巡回治疗组。
