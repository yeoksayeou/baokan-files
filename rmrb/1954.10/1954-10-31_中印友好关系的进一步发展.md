    Our Chinese people's friend, Indian Prime Minister Mr. Nehru, left our country yesterday to return to India after a ten-day visit. During Prime Minister Nehru's stay in our country, he held friendly talks with our government, had extensive contact with the responsible personnel of our government departments and the people, and visited the construction achievements and scenic spots in various parts of our country, receiving warm welcome and respect from our people. This is a manifestation of the strengthening of Sino-Indian relations. Prime Minister Nehru has made beneficial contributions to enhancing the understanding and mutual trust between the people of China and India, and strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries.
    The people of India and the people of China believe that they share common aspirations and needs, and we believe that we are both working to strive for peace and build our own countries. Chairman Mao Zedong said in his speech at the reception held by the Indian Ambassador to China for Prime Minister Nehru: "The people of China and India are both firmly in favor of peace. Our two peoples, like the people of the world, are determined to work for peace." Prime Minister Nehru also pointed out in his speech at the welcoming banquet given by Premier Zhou Enlai: "The greatest need in the world today is peace, and I am convinced that the Chinese people, like the Indian people, are loyal to the cause of peace." The common demand of China and India for peace is fully manifested in the mutual friendly visits of the two Prime Ministers, and it is also fully manifested in the friendly talks between the two countries and their results. We are willing to work together with India to overcome difficulties and establish and expand the peace zone in Asia, so as to consolidate the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    We are firmly opposed to any country's interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and we will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Our people are engaged in great socialist construction; our country is economically and culturally backward, and it takes great effort to complete the task of building socialism. Our people are pouring unparalleled enthusiasm and all their energy into this great cause, which is evident to any foreign friend who comes to visit our country. The preamble to our country's constitution stipulates: "The policy of our country in establishing and developing diplomatic relations with any country on the basis of the principles of equality,mutualbenefit,andmutualrespect for sovereignty and territorial integrity has achieved success and will continue to be implemented in the future." Therefore, we not only want to consolidate and develop the peaceful cooperation that has already been established between us and India, but we are also willing to establish the same relationship with any other country that has the same aspirations.
    The increase in Sino-Indian friendly relations is not pleasing to the imperialist war instigators. The reactionary American newspapers, as well as certain British newspapers that echo them, are constantly spreading rumors, saying that there are sharp differences between China and India during this meeting. However, Prime Minister Nehru pointed out at a press conference on October 26: "These reports are completely unfounded. Although there are some differences between India's basic attitude and China's basic attitude on certain issues, there have been no disagreements in our talks, and I am very happy to say that there is a great degree of consensus."
    The United States' attempt to provoke and slander friendly and cooperative relations between countries has once again been dealt a blow. The newspapers controlled by the Wall Street monopoly groups have been incessantly clamoring about the rapprochement and friendship between China and India, the two major Asian countries. They have made no secret of their extreme consternation at Prime Minister Nehru's visit to our country. The editorial of the American "Washington Star" on October 19 particularly bluntly admitted that they "are concerned about the nature of Nehru's trip and the possible effects it may have," saying that this is "a thing that is difficult to reassure people." This newspaper insisted that the principles of peaceful coexistence promoted by China and India "may create significant and possibly very harmful consequences for Western countries." This powerfully proves that the peaceful cooperation between China and India, and the efforts of China and India to expand the peace zone, are unfavorable to the war policy of the United States, but are completely beneficial to world peace.
    The gentlemen in Washington, harboring ulterior motives, are sparing no effort to use very clumsy means to oppose the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and are concentrating their efforts to attack the efforts of China and India to expand the peace zone. They contradict themselves by saying that China and India "have organized" an "axis," or that this Sino-Indian meeting has not achieved "definite guarantees" for the implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. They also slander China for wanting to organize a hostile bloc. This is all utter nonsense. China and India are both willing to develop mutual friendly relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and have repeatedly stated that these five principles should also be applied to general international relations. This is completely contrary to the American practice of piecing together military blocs everywhere and creating divisions and hostility. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have won widespread welcome and support among Asian countries, which proves that the Asian people do not welcome the organization of hostile military blocs, but welcome peaceful coexistence. Therefore, the implementation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is not only guaranteed between China and India, but is also likely to be extended to the relations of more Asian countries.
    The American ruling clique actually attempts to make the Asian people believe that only the American policy of organizing military blocs, splitting Asia, and preparing for war is a reliable "guarantee" for Asian peace; while the common efforts of Asian countries and peoples to seek peace and prosperous development are what "walking on a tightrope" and "unwise." This is in vain. What the American ruling clique is preparing to bring to the people of Asia and the world, and what kind of situation it has already created in many Asian countries, the facts before us have already made clear. The behind-the-scenes activities of the United States are creating political unrest in Indonesia; the military alliances and military aid that the United States has imposed on the people of Pakistan have also begun to produce adverse consequences in Pakistan. As for the United States' attempt to put together the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, intensify its support for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out war activities, and at the same time, regardless of everything, promote the war policy of reviving German militarism and establishing a Western European military bloc in Europe, it is even more seriously threatening the peace and security of the world.
    It is precisely because the aggressive and war policies of the United States are increasingly seriously threatening the peace and security of Asia and the world that the Chinese and Indian people cherish the enhancement of relations between the two countries even more. The people of the world, especially the people of Asia, have also paid very strong attention to Prime Minister Nehru's visit to the People's Republic of China. Progressive public opinion in countries such as Indonesia, Burma, Japan, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has widely praised Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China. The people of Asian countries and all peace-loving people regard Indian Prime Minister Nehru's visit to our country as a contribution to consolidating peace in the Far East and the world, and as a manifestation of the further enhancement of relations between the two major Asian countries.
    Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China has further enhanced mutual understanding and trust between the two countries. This Sino-Indian meeting was friendly and cordial from beginning to end. Although there are still many things to be done between our two countries, and the efforts for peace are always arduous; however, with mutual trust and cooperation, we will surely be able to do well. Sino-Indian relations are new acquaintances based on old acquaintances. We believe that the joint efforts made by China and India for the benefit of peace will further develop the relations between the two countries, which is of great significance to the cause of peace in Asia.

### 中印友好关系的进一步发展

    中印友好关系的进一步发展
    中国人民的朋友印度总理尼赫鲁先生，来我国进行了十天的访问之后，在昨天离开我国回印度去了。尼赫鲁总理留我国期间，曾同我国政府举行了友好会谈，广泛地接触了我国政府部门的负责人员和人民群众，并参观和访问了我国各地的建设成就和名胜，受到了我国人民热忱的欢迎和尊敬。这是中印关系加强的表现。尼赫鲁总理对于增进中印两国人民间的了解和互信，加强两国友好关系作了有益的贡献。
    印度人民和中国人民相信彼此都有着共同愿望和需要，我们相信我们都是在为争取和平和建设自己的国家而努力。毛泽东主席在印度驻我国大使为尼赫鲁总理举行的招待会上的致词中说：“中印两国人民都是坚决主张和平的。我们两国人民像全世界人民一样坚决为和平而努力。”尼赫鲁总理在周恩来总理的欢迎宴会上的讲话中也指出：“今日世界最大的需要是和平，我确信中国人民和印度人民一样是忠于和平事业的。”中印两国争取和平的共同要求，充分地表现在两国总理的相互友好的访问上，也充分地表现在两国的友好会谈和它的结果上。我们愿意同印度一道，共同努力，克服困难，建立和扩大亚洲的和平地区，以巩固亚洲和全世界的和平事业。
    我们坚决反对任何国家对别国事务的干涉，也绝不对别的国家进行干涉。我国人民正在进行着伟大的社会主义建设；我国在经济上和文化上都是落后的，要完成建设社会主义的任务是需要极大的努力的。我国人民正以无比的热情和全部的精力贯注在这个伟大的事业上，这是任何来到我国访问的外国朋友有目共见的。我国宪法的序言中规定：“我国根据平等、互利、互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则同任何国家建立和发展外交关系的政策，已经获得成就，今后将继续贯彻。”因此，我们不但愿意使我们和印度之间已经建立起来的和平合作更加巩固，更加发展，同时也愿意同其他任何具有同样愿望的国家建立同样的关系。
    中印友好关系的增进，是帝国主义战争挑拨者所不高兴的。美国反动报纸以及随声附和的英国某些报纸，不断地散布谣言，说什么中印两国在这次会谈过程中有着尖锐的分歧。但是，尼赫鲁总理十月二十六日在记者招待会上已经指出：“这些消息是完全没有根据的。虽然在某些问题上印度的基本态度同中国的基本态度有一些不同，但是在我们的会谈中并没有发生过分歧，而且我能很愉快地说，有很大程度的一致。”
    美帝国主义对各国友好合作关系的挑拨和中伤，又一次遭到了打击。华尔街垄断集团的御用报纸，一直对中、印两大亚洲国家的接近和友好，发出喋喋不休的喧嚷。他们毫不掩饰地对尼赫鲁总理的访问我国，表示极度的惶恐不安。十月十九日美国“华盛顿明星报”社论就特别露骨地承认，他们“对于尼赫鲁的旅行的性质和可能产生的效果感到忧虑”，说什么这是“很难使人安心的一桩事情”。这家报纸硬说中印两国推行和平共处的原则，“可能为西方国家造成重大的而且可能是十分有害的后果”。这就有力地证明，中印两国的和平合作，中印两国对扩大和平地区的努力，对于美国的战争政策是不利的，而对于世界和平却是完全有利的。
    华盛顿的心怀叵测的老爷们，不惜施展十分拙劣的手段，来反对和平共处的五项原则，集中力量攻讦中印两国扩大和平地区的努力。他们自相矛盾地不是说中印两国“已经组织了”一个“轴心”，就是说这次中印会谈对和平共处的五项原则的实施没有取得“肯定的保证”。他们又诬赖中国要想组织敌对集团。这都是彻头彻尾的胡说。中印两国都愿意在和平共处的五项原则的基础上发展相互的友好关系，并多次表示这五项原则也应适用于一般国际关系之中。这是同美国到处拼凑军事集团、制造分裂和敌对的做法，截然相反的。和平共处的五项原则，已在亚洲各国中博得了广泛的欢迎和支持，这就证明亚洲人民不欢迎组织敌对的军事集团，欢迎和平共处。因此，和平共处的五项原则的实施，不仅在中印两国之间是有保证的，而且有可能推广到更多的亚洲各国的关系之中。
    美国统治集团竟企图使亚洲人民相信只有正在组织军事集团、分裂亚洲、准备战争的美国政策，才是亚洲和平的可靠的“保证”；而亚洲各国和人民之间谋求和平和繁荣发展的共同努力，则是什么“走绳索”，“不明智”。这是枉然的。美国统治集团正在准备给亚洲和世界人民带来什么，它已经在许多亚洲国家中造成了怎样的局面，眼前的事实已经有了明显的说明。美国的幕后活动，正在造成印度尼西亚政局的动荡不安；美国强加在巴基斯坦人民身上的军事联盟和军事援助，也已开始在巴基斯坦产生不良的后果。至于美国拼凑东南亚侵略集团，加紧支持蒋介石卖国集团进行战争活动，同时不顾一切地在欧洲推行复活德国军国主义和建立西欧军事集团的战争政策，更严重地威胁着世界的和平和安全。
    正是由于美国的侵略政策和战争政策日益严重地威胁着亚洲和世界的和平和安全，因此，中印人民都更加珍视两国关系的增进。全世界人民，特别是亚洲的人民也对尼赫鲁总理的访问中华人民共和国，给予了极强烈的注意。印度尼西亚、缅甸、日本、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等国的进步舆论，广泛地赞扬尼赫鲁总理访问中国。亚洲各国人民和所有爱好和平的人民，都把印度总理尼赫鲁访问我国看作是对巩固远东和世界和平的贡献，是两个亚洲大国关系进一步增进的表现。
    尼赫鲁总理的访问中国，进一步增进了两国的互相了解和信任。这次中印会谈自始至终是友好的，而且是亲切的。虽然我们两国之间要做的事情还很多，对和平的努力总是艰巨的；但是，靠着互相的信任和合作，我们一定能够做得很好。中印关系是建立在旧相识的基础上面的新相知的关系。我们相信，中印两国为了和平的利益而作的共同努力，将使两国的关系得到进一步的发展，这对亚洲和平事业是有着重大的意义的。
