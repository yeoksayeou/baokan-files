Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: According to "l'Humanité," the French National Peace Council decided at a council meeting to recommend October 31st as a "National Day of Action for Peace."

In this recommendation, the Peace Council appealed to all peace committees in France and all organizations, groups, political figures, and the entire French people who support the peace movement to express their desire for peace on October 31st and to demand that the government realize this desire through action.

The recommendation pointed out that the French people should prevent any form of West German rearmament, strive for negotiations among the four major powers—France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States—to seek German reunification, and strive for universal disarmament and a ban on weapons of mass destruction.

The Peace Council called for the organization of the broadest possible propaganda work to encourage representatives from all sectors of society to participate in the movement and express their peaceful intentions in various ways.

The Peace Council concluded by stating that the work carried out on this day of action would serve as effective preparation for peace demonstrations to be held in the provinces in November and December.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: TASS, Paris, 18th—The National Committee of the French Republican Youth League held a meeting in the working-class district of Argenteuil on the outskirts of Paris. The meeting adopted a resolution and sent a letter to French Prime Minister Mendès France, reaffirming the firm will of French youth not to allow the rearming of Bonn's revanchists.

The committee discussed the issue of French youth participating in the struggle for peace, national independence, and the rights of French young men and women to work and study.  Duclos, Secretary-General of the French Republican Youth League, emphasized in his report that French youth resolutely oppose the arming of West Germany in any way. They demanded that members of parliament reject the London Agreements in the same way that they rejected the "European Defense Community" treaty.

Duclos also said in his report that the French Republican Youth League had recruited 10,000 new members in the past four months.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: TASS, Copenhagen, 16th—The Danish Lower House Foreign Policy Committee's resolution supporting the remilitarization of West Germany has aroused indignation among the Danish democratic public.

The bourgeois magazine "Free Denmark" devoted almost all of its October issue to this issue.  The magazine called on the people to rise up against the revival of German militarism and demanded that a referendum be held to decide on the attitude to be taken towards West German remilitarization.

"Land og Folk" is launching a signature campaign, calling for signatures on a protest against the government's policy of supporting West German militarization.  A delegation from the Danish Democratic Women's League submitted a letter of protest to the government on the 14th, protesting this policy, and began collecting signatures nationwide in support of the protest.

A. Larsen, Chairman of the Danish Communist Party, spoke in the Lower House's political discussion on the 14th.  He emphasized that a national referendum should be held to decide how to deal with the decisions of the London Conference.  He condemned the Lower House Foreign Policy Committee's resolution as not conforming to the will of the Danish people.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS, Copenhagen—The Danish people are protesting against the revival of German militarism.

The Danish Peace Defense Committee recently issued a statement demanding that the government and the Lower House not force a discussion in the Lower House on Denmark's attitude towards the London Nine-Power Conference's plans for arming West Germany, but instead hold a popular vote to decide this issue.  The statement pointed out that the people of all European countries, including the people of West Germany, strongly oppose the decisions of the London Conference. The statement also said that most of the Danish people oppose the revival of German militarism.  The recent request by the Soviet Union for negotiations among the four occupying powers has created new opportunities for a peaceful resolution of the German question, which would prevent Germany from being permanently divided into two parts.

On October 13th, a delegation elected by the Danish National Peace Conference in Odense presented a letter of protest to the government. The protest letter said:

	"We believe that the remilitarization of Germany is a fatal threat to Denmark."

Recently, a rally was held in Holbæk, Denmark, to protest against West German remilitarization, and speakers called for collecting signatures against the revival of German militarism.

"Land og Folk" has recently published many letters of protest against West German remilitarization. Other Danish newspapers have also recently published many articles against the revival of West German militarism.

    要求协商谋求德国重新统一，反对西德重新武装
    法国丹麦两国人民展开积极斗争
     【新华社十九日讯】巴黎消息：据“人道报”刊载：法国全国和平理事会在一次理事会议上决定：建议以十月三十一日为“全国争取和平行动日”。
    和平理事会在这项建议中吁请法国所有的和平委员会和所有支持和平运动的组织、团体、政界人士和全体法国人民在十月三十一日表达和平愿望，并要求政府以行动实现这种愿望。
    建议指出：法国人民应该阻止任何形式的西德的重新武装，争取法、英、苏、美四大国协商谋求德国重归统一，争取普遍裁减军备并禁止大规模毁灭性武器。
    和平理事会要求组织最广泛的宣传工作，促使社会各阶层代表人物参加运动，用各种方式表达他们的和平意愿。
    和平理事会最后提出：在这个运动日进行的工作将成为十一月和十二月举行各省和平示威的有效的准备。
     【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：法兰西共和青年联盟全国委员会在巴黎城郊阿葛邑工人区举行会议。会议通过决议并致函法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯，重申法国青年不允许武装波恩复仇分子的坚决意志。
    委员会讨论了关于法国青年参加争取和平、争取民族独立、争取法国青年男女劳动和学习的权利的斗争的问题。法兰西共和青年联盟总书记杜科朗在报告中着重指出，法国青年坚决反对以任何方式武装西德。他们要求议会议员像曾经拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约那样拒绝伦敦协议。
    杜科朗并且在报告中说，最近四个月来，法兰西共和青年联盟吸收了一万名新盟员。
      【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社哥本哈根十六日讯：丹麦下议院外交政策委员会关于支持西德重新军国主义化的决议引起了丹麦民主公众的愤慨。
    资产阶级的杂志“自由丹麦”十月号几乎用所有的篇幅谈论这一问题。这家杂志号召人民起来，反对复活德国军国主义，并且要求以公民投票的方式来决定对西德重新军国主义化应该采取的态度。
      “国土与人民报”正在展开一个签名运动，号召在一个反对政府奉行支持西德军国主义化的政策的抗议书上签名。丹麦民主妇女联合会的代表团十四日向政府提出一封抗议书，抗议这种政策，并开始在全国征集支持这一抗议书的签名。
    丹麦共产党主席阿·拉荪十四日在下议院的政治讨论中发言。他着重指出，应当由全国人民进行公民投票，来决定如何对待伦敦会议的决定的问题。他谴责下议院外交政策委员会的决议是不符合丹麦人民的意志的。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根讯：丹麦人民纷纷抗议复活德国军国主义。
    丹麦保卫和平委员会最近发表声明，要求政府和下议院不要强行在下议院讨论丹麦对伦敦九国会议关于武装西德的计划的态度，而举行人民投票来决定这个问题。声明指出，所有欧洲国家的人民，包括西德人民在内，都强烈反对伦敦会议的决定。声明还说：大部分丹麦人民都反对复活德国军国主义。苏联最近提出的四个占领国家举行谈判的要求为和平解决德国问题创造了新的机会，这将能够防止德国永远分裂为两部分。
    十月十三日，丹麦全国和平会议在鄂丹斯选出的一个代表团向政府提出了抗议书。抗议书说：
  “我们认为，德国的重新军国主义化是对丹麦的一种致命的威胁。”
    最近在丹麦的荷尔贝克城，举行了一个抗议西德重新军国主义化的集会，发言的人们要求收集反对复活德国军国主义的签名。
    “国土与人民报”最近刊载了许多反对西德重新军国主义化的抗议书。丹麦的其他报纸最近也发表了许多反对复活西德军国主义的文章。
