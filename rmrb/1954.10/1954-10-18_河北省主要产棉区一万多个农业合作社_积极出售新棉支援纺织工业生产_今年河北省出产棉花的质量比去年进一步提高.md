Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, October 17th: More than 12,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the major cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province, such as Handan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang, are actively selling cotton to the state to support the national textile industry production. On September 28th alone, eight agricultural producers' cooperatives in Boyan Village, Wu'an County, Handan Special District, sold more than 18,000 jin of cotton to the state. From the beginning of picking new cotton in early September to October 12th, 172 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Nangong County, Xingtai Special District, have sold more than 800,000 jin of seed cotton to the state.

These agricultural producers' cooperatives, due to good cotton field management, are selling not only a large quantity of cotton to the state, but also cotton of good quality. It has been repeatedly sun-dried and selected to truly achieve dryness, whiteness, and cleanliness, with no dead bolls or yellow cotton bolls. On September 28th, the Boyan Township Cotton Collection Station in Wu'an County collected more than 33,000 jin of cotton, more than half of which was sold by agricultural producers' cooperatives. According to statistics from the Chengguan Town Cotton Collection Station in Nangong County on October 10th and 11th: the more than 16,900 jin of seed cotton sold to the state by 20 agricultural producers' cooperatives was all good cotton with a high lint yield, long fibers, and white color. More than 80 percent of the cotton from agricultural producers' cooperatives in Nangong County has been repeatedly sun-dried and selected before being sold.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, October 15th: Hebei Province, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the country's total cotton production, has further improved the quality of its cotton this year compared to last year. According to the inspection certificates of the national cotton collection stations: among the new cotton recently sold to the state by cotton farmers in Handan and Xingtai Special Districts, lint with a fiber length of 1 and 1/16 inches accounted for more than 85 percent of the purchased quantity, while during the same period last year, such cotton only accounted for more than 70 percent. The ginning outturn rate (the percentage of lint cotton ginned from seed cotton) of new cotton in Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang and other special districts is generally above 35 percent, with the highest reaching 40 percent, which is also 3 to 5 percent higher than last year. The impurities and moisture content of the new cotton have also been reduced compared to last year, and the vast majority meet the national procurement standards.

    河北省主要产棉区一万多个农业合作社
    积极出售新棉支援纺织工业生产
    今年河北省出产棉花的质量比去年进一步提高
      【新华社保定十七日电】河北省邯郸、邢台、石家庄等主要产棉区一万二千多个农业生产合作社积极把棉花卖给国家，支援国家纺织工业生产。邯郸专区武安县伯延村八个农业生产合作社在九月二十八日这一天就卖给国家一万八千多斤棉花。邢台专区南宫县一百七十二个农业生产合作社，从九月初采摘新棉花开始，到十月十二日，已卖给国家八十多万斤籽棉。
    这些农业生产合作社由于棉田管理得好，卖给国家的棉花不但数量多，而且质量好，都是经过再三晒拣，真正达到干、白、净，没有僵瓣和黄棉瓣。武安县伯延乡收棉站在九月二十八日收了三万三千多斤棉花，其中，农业生产合作社卖的占一半以上。据南宫县城关镇收棉站十月十日、十一日两天的统计：二十个农业生产合作社，卖给国家一万六千九百多斤的籽棉都是出皮棉多，绒长、色泽洁白的好棉花。南宫县百分之八十以上的农业生产合作社的棉花，在出卖前都经过再三翻晒和拣选。
    【新华社保定十五日电】棉花产量占全国总产量近四分之一的河北省，今年棉花的质量比去年进一步提高。根据国家收棉站的检验证明：邯郸、邢台专区种棉农民最近卖给国家的新棉中，绒长一又十六分之一吋的皮棉占收购量百分之八十五以上，而去年同期这样的棉花只占百分之七十多。邯郸、邢台、石家庄等专区新棉的衣分率（籽棉轧成皮棉的百分率）一般都在百分之三十五以上，最高的达到百分之四十，也比去年提高了百分之三到百分之五。新棉所含的杂质、水分也比去年减少，绝大多数合乎国家规定的收购标准。
