Editorial:

    The London Conference held by nine countries, including Britain, France, the United States, Belgium, Canada, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, shows that the United States and its followers of the "policy of strength" are still disregarding the lessons of the disastrous failure of the "European Defense Community" plan and have decided to establish an exclusive military bloc in Western Europe to accelerate the revival of German militarism in order to prepare for a new war in Europe. The people of all European countries and the peace-loving people of the world must resolutely oppose this sinister policy of creating division and war by the United States and its followers.
    According to the "Final Act" of the London Nine-Power Conference, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States decided to expand the Brussels Treaty to include West Germany and Italy, and to rearm West Germany within this alliance; at the same time, West Germany was dragged into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. It is clear at a glance that these decisions of the London Conference serve only one purpose: to attempt to circumvent the difficulties and obstacles encountered by the war policy of the United States, as well as the divisions between it and other Western countries, especially the ruling groups of Britain and France, in order to openly implement the US policy of rearming West Germany.
    It is enough for people to note that the main purpose of the "Final Act" of the London Nine-Power Conference is actually the same as that of the so-called "European Defense Community Treaty" and the Bonn "General Treaty," which have completely gone bankrupt. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States pretend to announce the end of the "occupation regime" in West Germany, but at the same time decide to keep their occupation troops in West Germany indefinitely in order to "fulfill certain responsibilities in Germany arising from the international situation," which is to continue to obstruct the restoration of German unity. Therefore, the so-called restoration of West Germany's "sovereignty" is only to enable the militarist forces in West Germany to freely rearm, remilitarize West Germany, and legalize the continued occupation of West Germany by the United States, Britain, and France. The expanded Brussels Treaty is a military bloc that mutually undertakes military and war obligations, allowing West Germany to provide "defense contributions" in accordance with the "size and general characteristics" stipulated by the "European Defense Community," that is, West Germany will form a "defense force" with 500,000 troops and 1,350 aircraft. This "defense force" of West Germany will be under the command of the so-called Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, together with the troops of other North Atlantic aggressive bloc countries stationed on the European continent, that is, under the command of US General Gruenther. It can be seen that the so-called restoration of West Germany's "sovereignty" and the so-called expansion of the Brussels Treaty are ultimately aimed at incorporating the newly revived West German "defense force" into the North Atlantic Treaty forces as the main tool for the United States to carry out aggressive adventures in Europe.
    The purpose of the London Agreement to revive German militarism is very obvious, but the US aggressive bloc and its followers are trying to conceal the dangerous nature of this practice. They are trying their best to emphasize the limitations on the level of West German troops in the London Agreement and the methods of arms supervision of the Brussels Treaty countries, as well as the so-called guarantees of continued stationing of troops in Western Europe by Britain and the United States, in an attempt to use this method to paralyze public opinion in various countries against the vigilance of the revival of German militarism. However, these restrictions, supervisions, and guarantees are of no practical value. Historical experience has repeatedly proven that once German militarism is revived, it cannot be restricted, and it cannot be prevented from launching aggression again.
    People all remember that after the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles also stipulated strict restrictions on German armaments, and the Locarno Pact also provided guarantees for the security of France and Belgium. However, German militarism was not "restricted." After gradually growing stronger with the support of the United States, it openly tore up the military clauses of Versailles and turned the guarantees of the Locarno Pact into a mockery of history. The Second World War therefore became inevitable. Now that the London Conference agreement is to revive German militarism and drag West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, thus completely handing over the West German revanchist army to US General Gruenther, the Supreme Allied Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe, who has been specially strengthened in power, then West Germany will inevitably remilitarize and will inevitably retrace the old path of Hitler's crazy aggression. This is obvious.
    The US aggressive bloc does not hide their satisfaction with the London Agreement and their eagerness to accelerate the rearmament of West Germany. US Secretary of State Dulles openly said in a statement issued after returning to Washington from London that the London Agreement "saved many valuable elements of the European Defense Community plan." US Deputy Commander-in-Chief in Europe, Orval Cook, even more brazenly declared: "Huge supplies of American military equipment have been stored in Europe, and these supplies will be handed over to the new German army as soon as orders are received." Reuters said that West Germany will "have the most powerful, fully motorized army in Western Europe, supported by the largest veteran reserve." It can be seen that in the minds of the US aggressive bloc and the West German militarists, everything is ready, waiting for the London Agreement to be approved, and then the Washington-Bonn military aggressive axis will be openly established.
    Obviously, this is full of threats to the peace and security of Europe and the world. The London Conference's plan to revive German militarism and advocate the establishment of a military bloc composed of several Western countries will not only keep Germany in a state of division for a long time but will also strengthen the tense situation in Europe. Therefore, this will greatly increase the danger of a new war in Europe, thereby increasing the danger of a new world war. It is very clear that the Western European countries, including Britain and France, that follow the US "policy of strength" will cause serious damage to their own interests.
    However, the London Agreement does not mean that the rearmament of West Germany has become a reality. The world's peace-loving forces are making great efforts to rebuild German unity and consolidate peace in Europe and the world. The Soviet Union has long put forward reasonable proposals for solving the German question and establishing a European collective security system; Foreign Minister Molotov also pointed out again in his speech at the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin on October 6 that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have the responsibility to do their best to promote the settlement of the issue of restoring German unity, and expressed that the Soviet government is ready to consider the proposals previously put forward by the participants of the Berlin Conference and new proposals that may be put forward on the issue of free elections throughout Germany. Prior to this, the Soviet representative also put forward a proposal at the United Nations General Assembly on concluding an international convention on reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. These proposals and efforts of the Soviet Union to rebuild German unity and consolidate peace are increasingly attracting the sympathy and attention of public opinion in Europe and the world. It guides the great struggle of the peace-loving people of all countries to win and consolidate peace in Europe and the world.
      Public opinion in various countries, including France, Britain, and West Germany, is condemning the resolutions of the London Nine-Power Conference and firmly demanding the resumption of direct consultations between the four countries and East and West Germany in order to seek the restoration of German unity and the consolidation of peace in Europe. This strong demand of public opinion in various countries cannot be ignored; the US aggressive bloc and its followers' attempt to block the road to solving the German question with a plan to revive German militarism is impossible. The people of all European countries, especially the French people, who once defeated the "European Defense Community" plan with unremitting struggle, should resolutely prevent the implementation of the plan to revive German militarism. The people of all European countries and the peace-loving people of the world must continue to unite and wage a resolute struggle to defeat the US aggressive bloc's new sinister plan to revive German militarism.

### 反对复活德国军国主义的新计划

    反对复活德国军国主义的新计划
    英国、法国、美国、比利时、加拿大、西德、意大利、卢森堡、荷兰等九国举行的伦敦会议表明，美国及其“实力政策”的追随者依然不顾“欧洲防务集团”计划惨重失败的教训，决定在西欧建立排他性的军事集团，以加速复活德国军国主义，来在欧洲准备新的战争。欧洲各国和全世界爱好和平的人民，一定要坚决反对美国及其追随者的这种制造分裂和战争的罪恶政策。
    根据伦敦九国会议的“最后决议书”，英、法、美三国决定扩大布鲁塞尔条约，容纳西德和意大利参加，并在这个联盟的范围内重新武装西德；同时把西德拖入北大西洋侵略集团。一眼就可以看出：伦敦会议的这些决定只是为了一个目的，那就是：企图绕过美国的战争政策所遭受到的困难和阻碍，以及它和其他西方国家特别是和英、法两国统治集团之间的分歧，来公开地实行美国重新武装西德的政策。
    人们只要注意到这一点就够了：伦敦九国会议的“最后决议书”的主要目的，实际上同已经彻底破产了的所谓“欧洲防务集团条约”和波恩“一般性条约”是一样的。英、法、美三国假意宣布要结束对西德的“占领政权”，同时却又决定把它们的占领军队无限期地留在西德，以便“在德国执行某些由于国际局势的关系而产生的责任”，也就是要继续阻挠恢复德国的统一。因此，所谓恢复西德的“主权”，只是为了使西德的军国主义势力得以自由地进行重新武装，使西德重新军国主义化，并使美、英、法继续占领西德合法化。而扩大了的布鲁塞尔条约则是一个互相承担军事和战争义务的军事集团，它容许西德按照“欧洲防务集团”所规定的“大小和一般特点”提供“防务贡献”，也就是说西德将组成一支拥有五十万人和一千三百五十架飞机的“国防军”。西德的这一支“国防军”将和北大西洋侵略集团其他国家驻在欧洲大陆上的军队一起，归所谓盟国驻欧最高总司令统辖，也就是归美国将军格仑瑟统辖。由此可见，所谓恢复西德
  “主权”，所谓扩大布鲁塞尔条约，归根结底是为了把重新复活起来的西德“国防军”，并入北大西洋公约军队，以作为美国在欧洲进行侵略冒险的主要工具。
    伦敦协议复活德国军国主义的目的是非常明显的，但是美国侵略集团及其追随者却力图掩饰这种做法的危险性质。它们竭力强调伦敦协议对于西德军队水平的限制和对布鲁塞尔条约国家军备监督的办法，以及英美继续驻军西欧的所谓保证，企图以这种手法来麻痹各国舆论对复活德国军国主义的警惕。但是，这种限制、监督和保证是没有什么实际的价值的。历史的经验早已一再证明，德国军国主义一旦被复活起来，就无法对它加以限制，也无法防止它重新进行侵略的。
    人们都记得，第一次世界大战之后，凡尔赛条约对德国的军备也曾规定过严格的限制，并且洛加诺公约也曾对法、比的安全作过保证。但是，德国军国主义并没有被“限制”住，它在美国的扶植下逐步壮大之后，就公然撕毁了凡尔赛的军事条款，并使洛加诺公约的保证也变成了对历史的讽刺。第二次世界大战因此成为不可避免。现在，伦敦会议的协议既然要把德国军国主义复活起来，同时又把西德拖入了北大西洋侵略集团，因而把西德复仇主义的军队完全交到被特别加强了权力的北大西洋公约驻欧盟国最高司令美国将军格仑瑟的手中，那么西德就必然会重新军国主义化，它就必然会重新走上希特勒的疯狂侵略的老路，这是显而易见的。
    美国侵略集团毫不讳言他们对伦敦协议所感到的满意和他们对于加速实现重新武装西德的迫切心情。美国国务卿杜勒斯在从伦敦回到华盛顿后所发表的声明中，就公然说：伦敦协议“挽救了欧洲防务集团计划的许多可贵的因素”。驻欧美军副总司令奥瓦尔·库克更放肆地宣称：“庞大的美国军事装备供应品已存储在欧洲，一俟得到命令，就要把这些供应品交给新的德国军队”。路透社说：西德将“拥有所有西欧国家中最强大的、有最巨大的退伍军人后备支持的、完全摩托化的陆军”。由此可见，在美国侵略集团及西德军国主义者的心目中，已是万事齐备，只待伦敦协议批准，就要公开建立华盛顿—波恩的军事侵略轴心了。
    显然，这对于欧洲以及全世界的和平和安全充满着威胁。伦敦会议复活德国军国主义和主张建立
  一个由好几个西方国家组成的军事集团的计划，不但将使德国长期处于分裂状态，并将加强欧洲的紧张形势。因而，这将大大加剧在欧洲发生新战争的危险，从而加剧新的世界大战的危险。追随美国“实力政策”的西欧国家，包括英国和法国在内，将使它们自己的利益遭到严重的损害是十分清楚的。
    但是，伦敦协议决不意味着西德的重新武装已经成为事实。世界爱好和平的力量正在为重建德国的统一和巩固欧洲以及全世界的和平进行着巨大的努力。苏联为解决德国问题和建立欧洲的集体安全体系早已提出了合理的建议；莫洛托夫外长十月六日在柏林的德意志民主共和国成立五周年庆祝大会上的演说中并再度指出：美、英、法、苏四国有责任尽力促成恢复德国统一问题的解决，并表示：苏联政府准备考虑柏林会议的参与国以前提出的建议以及在全德自由选举问题上可能提出的新建议。在此以前，苏联代表并在联合国大会上提出了关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约的建议。苏联的这些为重建德国统一，巩固和平的建议和努力，正日益吸引着欧洲和全世界舆论的同情和注意。它指引着各国爱好和平的人民为争取和巩固欧洲和全世界的和平的伟大斗争。
      各国舆论，包括法国、英国和西德的舆论在内，正在谴责伦敦九国会议的决议，并坚决要求重新举行四国和东西德的直接商谈，以谋求恢复德国的统一和巩固欧洲的和平。各国舆论的这种强烈的要求是不容忽视的；美国侵略集团及其追随者企图以复活德国军国主义的计划堵死解决德国问题的道路，这是办不到的。曾经以坚持不懈的斗争打垮了
  “欧洲防务集团”计划的欧洲各国人民，特别是法国人民，应该坚决阻止复活德国军国主义的计划的实施。欧洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民必须继续团结起来，为击败美国侵略集团复活德国军国主义的新的罪恶计划进行坚决的斗争。
