    I. The Constant Improvement of People's Lives is the Fundamental Feature That Distinguishes Socialist Industrialization from Capitalist Industrialization
    Stalin, speaking at the Fifteenth National Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), said the following about the fundamental difference between socialist and capitalist industrialization: "What is the main shortcoming of the capitalist method of industrialization? It lies in separating the interests of industrialization from the interests of the working masses, sharpening domestic contradictions, and impoverishing millions of workers and peasants... What is the main advantage of the socialist method of industrialization? It lies in aligning the interests of industrialization with the interests of the basic masses of the working population; in not impoverishing millions of people, but improving their material living conditions."
    This fundamental difference between socialist and capitalist industrialization has been fully proven by the historical facts of industrialization in the Soviet Union and capitalist countries. Take, for example, the years 1926 to 1929, when the Soviet people struggled arduously to achieve national industrialization. During these years, the lives of the Soviet people continued to improve with the progress of industrialization. For example, in 1926, the average monthly wage of workers in Soviet industry was 56.74 rubles; in 1927, it increased to 64.07 rubles; in 1928, it increased to 70.24 rubles; and in 1929, it further increased to 77.06 rubles. The budget for workers' social insurance increased from 980 million rubles in 1926-1927 to 1.4 billion rubles in 1929-1930. During the same period, housing construction in Soviet cities increased from 3,225,800 square meters in 1926 to 4,741,100 square meters in 1929; the number of students in primary and secondary schools in the Soviet Union increased from 10,193,900 in 1925-1926 to 12,074,800 in 1928-1929; and the number of students in primary vocational schools increased from 528,600 in 1925-1926 to 712,800 in 1928-1929. In contrast, in the process of industrialization in capitalist countries, the working people became increasingly impoverished and bankrupt. For example, in 1843, British workers' share of national income was 45.6 percent, while in 1884 it was only 41.4 percent, and in 1903 it was only 38.3 percent. The share of American workers in the distribution of national production decreased by a total of 35 percent in the 20 years from 1899 to 1919. In the 1860s, the poorest residents in the United States accounted for 65 percent of the total population, but they only owned 6.5 percent of the national wealth, while 2 percent of the rich owned 56.9 percent of the national wealth; twenty years later, the number of poor people in the United States continued to increase, while the wealth belonging to them decreased from 6.5 percent to 5 percent, and the wealth belonging to the rich increased from 56.9 percent to 66.6 percent. It is particularly worth noting that unemployment in capitalist countries is not eliminated by the realization of national industrialization. For example, the number of unemployed in Britain increased from 1.29 million in 1928 to 2.8 million in 1932; the number of unemployed in Germany increased from 1,376,000 in 1928 to 5.5 million in 1932. The United States had the greatest achievements in industrialization, but also the most unemployed people. At the end of 1932, the number of unemployed workers in all industries in the United States reached 11.1 million. However, after the Soviet Union implemented the policy of industrialization, it fundamentally eliminated unemployment in the first Five-Year Plan.
    The reason why socialist industrialization leads to the continuous improvement of the material and cultural lives of the working people, and why capitalist industrialization leads to the increasing impoverishment and bankruptcy of the working people, is by no means accidental.
    First, socialist industrialization is carried out on the basis of public ownership of the means of production. Public ownership of the means of production not only provides a broad source of industrialization funding, but also allows the industrialization effort to develop in the interests of the whole society. Every step forward in socialist industrialization means a step further in the expansion of public ownership of the means of production, which means an increase in property owned by the whole people, and thus also means that the state has greater power to expand reproduction and improve people's lives. In contrast, capitalist industrialization is carried out on the basis of capitalist private ownership of the means of production. Capitalist private ownership of the means of production not only prevents capitalist industrialization from developing in the interests of the whole society, but also causes the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class and other working people to widen day by day. Every step forward in capitalist industrialization means the increasing bankruptcy of small producers and the increasing number of proletarians, meaning that social wealth is increasingly concentrated in the hands of capitalists, while the vast majority of working people are becoming increasingly impoverished.
    Second, socialist industrialization is determined by the socialist basic economic law. Socialist industrialization is the main means to guarantee the realization of the requirements of the socialist basic economic law. Because only by realizing socialist industrialization can we guarantee the priority development of heavy industry, and only when heavy industry is developed can we transform the entire national economy on a high technical basis, equip light industry, the food industry, agriculture, transportation and other material production sectors with first-class technology, improve the labor productivity of all production sectors, and enable socialist production to grow and improve continuously, so as to gradually achieve the goal of maximizing the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. Precisely for this reason, every step forward in socialist industrialization will inevitably be accompanied by a step forward in the improvement of people's lives. Capitalist industrialization, on the other hand, is governed by the capitalist basic economic law. The capitalist basic economic law determines that the purpose of the bourgeoisie in developing industry is not to improve people's lives, but to pursue as much profit as possible; it also determines that the means by which the bourgeoisie develops industry is to exploit and plunder domestic and foreign working people to the fullest extent. Therefore, every step forward in capitalist industrialization only brings greater profits to the bourgeoisie and deeper hardship and poverty to the vast majority of working people.
    Third, the development of socialist industrialization is also constrained by the law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy. This law requires that in the development of the national economy, a certain proportional relationship must be maintained between the various sectors of the national economy and the various aspects of reproduction. Therefore, in the development process of socialist industrialization, with the planned development of socialist industrial sectors, other national economic sectors will inevitably be developed accordingly in accordance with the unified national economic plan; at the same time, the various aspects of reproduction will inevitably be perfected in coordination without being detached from each other. For example, with the planned development of industry, industry increasingly requires agriculture to provide more grain and raw materials, and requires the countryside to have a broader market for industrial products, so the development of industry itself requires the corresponding planned development of agriculture. And the development of agriculture means the increasing income of farmers and the continuous improvement of their lives. In contrast, capitalist industrialization is governed by the laws of competition and anarchy of production. Under the control of this law, capitalist industrialization is not only impossible to develop in a planned way, but also inevitably creates uncoordinated and unbalanced phenomena between various sectors of the national economy and various aspects of reproduction in its development process. For example, in capitalist society, it is often more profitable to engage in industry than in agriculture, so capitalists compete to invest in industry, thus making industrial and agricultural production develop disproportionately, making agriculture lag far behind industry, and having to endure the exploitation of industry. Under the conditions of industrial exploitation of agriculture, capitalist cities often achieve distorted prosperity, while the vast majority of residents in rural areas become increasingly impoverished and bankrupt.
    At the same time, socialist industrialization is realized through the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class. The happy life of the people is the highest criterion for all actions of the Communist Party and the working class. The Party's adoption of the方針 and policies of socialist industrialization is precisely in line with the laws of social development, the requirements of socialist economic laws, and the highest interests of the working people, and it is also for the purpose of continuously improving the lives of the working people. In contrast, capitalist industrialization is achieved through the plunder and exploitation of the bourgeoisie. Profit-seeking is the highest criterion for all actions of the bourgeoisie. They will never care about people's lives, nor will they use capitalist industrialization to seek benefits for the people or improve their lives.
    It can be seen that socialist industrialization and the improvement of people's lives are closely related and have objective necessity.
    Socialist industrialization not only inevitably leads to the continuous improvement of people's lives, but its own development must also be based on the continuous improvement of people's lives. Because only when the lives of the working people become richer day by day can they have more power to purchase industrial products, engage in savings, purchase public bonds, etc., to help the country accumulate industrialization funds. Therefore, from this perspective, the process of socialist industrialization development must also be a process of continuous improvement of people's lives.
    II. The Improvement of People's Lives Must Be Subordinate to the Development of Production and to the Development of Socialist Industrialization
    The fundamental purpose of socialist industrialization is, of course, to continuously improve people's lives, but the improvement of people's lives must be subordinate to the development of production and to the development of socialist industrialization. It is not difficult to understand that if production does not develop, people's income cannot increase, and life cannot be improved; it is also not difficult to understand that during the period of socialist transformation, if socialist industrialization does not develop, the entire national economy will not be transformed, it will remain at a backward level, and people's lives will not be improved. Therefore, the improvement of life must be subordinate to the development of production and to the development of socialist industrialization, and should not be excessively or one-sidedly emphasized. There were also people who did not understand this principle, advocating that under socialist or communist conditions, everything produced by the working people should be consumed by themselves. For example, Lassalle, a famous opportunist political commentator in Germany in the mid-19th century, advocated that workers should receive all their labor products without discount under socialist conditions. Marx, in "Critique of the Gotha Program," thoroughly refuted Lassalle's view, arguing that it was a very harmful opportunist view. According to Marx's scientific prediction, expanded reproduction under socialist conditions is a necessary condition for increasing social wealth and improving people's lives. Marx brilliantly formulated the principle of the composition and use of social funds under socialist conditions, stipulating that from all social products created by laborers, the following should first be deducted: expenditures to compensate for consumed means of production, additional parts for expanding reproduction, and parts for forming reserve funds and insurance funds (to prevent accidents and disasters). After these are deducted, the remaining part of the social product is used as means of consumption, but before this part of the means of consumption is used for personal distribution, it must also be deducted from it: "First, general administrative costs that do not belong to production... Second, that part which is destined for the common satisfaction of needs, such as schools and health services, etc.... Third, funds for those unable to work, in short, what today belongs to so-called official charity." (Marx: "Critique of the Gotha Program") After this, the remaining part of the means of consumption is distributed for personal consumption purposes according to the quantity and quality of the labor of each worker. Marx believed that labor spent on products other than those used for personal consumption was equally necessary. It is very clear that if all social products were distributed to each person for their own consumption, then social expanded reproduction would be impossible, socialist industrialization funds would have no way to accumulate, and naturally, there would be no question of providing the state with the necessary management costs and other costs. If too much of the social product is distributed to each person for their own consumption, then social expanded reproduction will be greatly affected, the accumulation of industrialization funds will encounter more difficulties, and the realization of socialist industrialization will be delayed. As a result, people's lives will inevitably be difficult to improve rapidly.
    At the same time, according to Marx's principle that the growth of the production of the means of production takes priority under the conditions of expanded reproduction, we can also understand that the improvement of people's lives must be subordinate to the development of production and to the development of socialist industrialization, which is also an objective necessity. Because in order to compensate for the means of production consumed in the production process, to expand the scale of production in all material production sectors, and to ensure the production of increasingly abundant consumer goods to meet the constantly growing needs of the people, the production of the means of production sectors is required to continuously provide sufficient machinery, equipment, and raw materials. Otherwise, not only will the production of the means of production sectors not be developed, but the production of consumer goods sectors will also be impossible to develop. Therefore, when the state considers developing production, it should always give priority to developing the production of the means of production, and should ensure that the growth of the production of the means of production takes priority, and should not emphasize the development of the production of consumer goods one-sidedly and emphasize satisfying the people's living needs by departing from the basis of developing the production of the means of production.
    Especially in the early stages of industrialization, because the production of the means of production is generally very backward, the state must concentrate its main forces to focus on developing heavy industry first, and it is impossible and should not use the same forces to develop the production of consumer goods. Therefore, at this time, the improvement of people's lives should be more subordinate to the development of production and to the development of socialist industrialization, so that the state can accumulate more funds to develop heavy industry.
    Guaranteeing expanded socialist reproduction and focusing on the development of heavy industry will inevitably lead to the rapid growth of the purchasing power of the working people. This is because expanded socialist reproduction and the development of heavy industry are carried out on a very large scale. In order to continuously expand the scale of production and build countless heavy industrial enterprises, the state must continuously increase the number of enterprise employees and purchase large amounts of grain and industrial raw materials. As a result, the large amount of funds raised by the state for developing production and building heavy industry is either paid to workers in the form of wages or paid to farmers in the form of purchasing agricultural products, thereby causing a large increase in the purchasing power of workers and peasants. On the other hand, because the state must at all times guarantee expanded reproduction and guarantee that the growth of the production of the means of production takes priority, and should not inappropriately and excessively expand the production of consumer goods, it will inevitably lead to the phenomenon that the growth of consumer goods cannot keep up with the growth of the masses' purchasing power. Stalin once said: "In the Soviet Union, the growth of mass consumption (purchasing power) always exceeds the growth of production"
  ("Summary Report on the Political Work of the Central Committee at the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)"). Especially in the early stages of industrialization, because the state must concentrate its main forces on developing heavy industry and does not have time to develop the production of consumer goods relatively quickly, the phenomenon that the growth of consumer goods cannot keep up with the growth of purchasing power becomes even more prominent. The Soviet Union and my country were like this in the early stages of industrialization. For example, although my country's cotton cloth production in 1953 increased by 27 percent compared with 1952, because the purchasing power of the vast majority of people increased more rapidly, the market sales of cotton cloth in the same period increased by as much as 47 percent, resulting in a situation where the supply of cotton cloth could not meet the demand.
    In response to this situation, in addition to developing the production of consumer goods as much as possible, the state must also take some necessary measures to appropriately resolve the contradiction between the supply and demand of consumer goods. For example, from the end of 1928, the Soviet Union began to implement a food rationing system in cities such as Moscow and Leningrad, and in 1929, this rationing system was universally implemented in cities across the country; at the same time, from 1929, the Soviet Union also began to implement a rationing system for fabrics, clothing, and soap. Since the winter of 1953, our country has implemented the policy of planned purchase and planned supply of grain, and since September 15, 1954, it has implemented the policy of planned purchase and planned supply of cotton cloth and the policy of planned purchase of cotton. These measures can not only appropriately resolve the contradiction between supply and demand, but also stabilize prices, crack down on market speculation, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist industrialization.
    Originally, if we understand the principle that improving life must be subordinate to the development of production and to the development of socialist industrialization, then it is easy to understand and sincerely support the phenomenon of short supply of certain consumer goods and the measures taken by the state to resolve the contradiction between supply and demand. However, in fact, not everyone can do this. Some comrades feel doubtful and dissatisfied when they see this phenomenon. Individual comrades are even full of complaints and panic, seemingly regarding this as a "strange disaster" in the new society. These comrades would do well to review the following passage by Comrade Kuibyshev in the early stages of Soviet industrialization: "The lack of commodities is not a strange disaster that makes us panic. Demand exceeding supply can promote the rapid development of industry, which shows that the material welfare of residents is improving, and therefore this is a factor that stimulates industrialization and stimulates the development of heavy industry." ("The Basic Tasks of National Industrialization") The fact is exactly the same. Since 1953, my country has presented a more prominent phenomenon of commodity shortages, but in 1953, my country's social purchasing power increased by about 20 percent, and my country's total industrial output value increased by 33 percent compared with 1952, of which heavy industry increased even faster. Isn't this showing that residents' welfare is growing and the industrialization cause is developing rapidly!
    There are also some comrades who, when they see the difficulties in entering schools, crowded theaters, crowded housing, crowded medical care, etc. that occur when the state concentrates its main forces on developing heavy industry and implementing socialist industrialization, they feel very dissatisfied and think that this is a phenomenon that should not exist in the new society. They did not think that the country has increased many schools, hospitals, cultural and recreational venues and other public facilities in recent years. For example, in 1953, the number of students in secondary schools nationwide increased by 15 percent compared with 1952, the number of beds in public hospitals affiliated to the Central Ministry of Health increased by 18 percent compared with 1952, and the number of cinemas, cultural centers and other public cultural and recreational venues increased. It is only because as a result of the victory of the revolution, the working people have changed from a position of servitude to masters, and they have all begun to enjoy cultural and recreational life, so it appears very crowded everywhere, and as their material and cultural life requirements continue to increase, although the country will gradually add many cultural and material welfare facilities, it will still be crowded. Just like today's Soviet Union, going to certain public places is still inevitably crowded. But what's so bad about this phenomenon? This just shows the prosperous and flourishing atmosphere of the new society and shows that people's lives are constantly improving.
    Naturally, there are also a very small number of people, such as speculative merchants, who cannot arbitrarily speculate and seek illegal profits now, and their lives will be lower than in the past. If they do not change this behavior, it will even be difficult to maintain their lives; and some people who used to serve as senior officials in reactionary government agencies or bureaucrat-capitalist enterprises cannot retain the high positions and salaries they used to have, and their lives will also be lowered. But isn't this phenomenon appropriate? What is there to be alarmed about?
    In short, each of us should proceed from the interests of the collective, recognize the principle that improving life must be subordinate to the development of production and to the development of socialist industrialization, and use this principle to measure our level of consciousness, handle our own lives, criticize our own wrong ideas, and develop a hard-working, simple and frugal lifestyle in our actual lives. In this way, the socialist industrialization cause of our great motherland will surely develop smoothly, and our lives will surely continue to improve.

    社会主义工业化和改善人民生活
    邹树民
    一、不断导致人民生活的改善，是社会主义工业化不同于资本主义工业化的根本特点
    斯大林在联共（布）第十五次全国代表会议上讲到社会主义工业化与资本主义工业化的根本区别时，曾经说道：“资本主义工业化方法的主要缺点在哪里呢？在于它使工业化的利益和劳动群众的利益脱节，使国内矛盾尖锐化，使千百万工农群众贫穷化……社会主义工业化方法的主要优点在哪里呢？在于它使工业化的利益和居民中劳动阶层的基本群众的利益趋于一致；在于它不是使千百万群众贫穷化，而是改善他们的物质生活状况”。
    社会主义工业化与资本主义工业化这一根本不同的特点，完全由苏联和资本主义国家工业化的历史事实得到了证明。就以一九二六年至一九二九年苏联人民为实现国家工业化而艰苦斗争的年代来说，这几年苏联人民的生活仍是随着工业化事业的进展而不断改善。比如，一九二六年，苏联工业中工人的月平均工资为五十六点七四卢布，一九二七年即增为六十四点零七卢布，一九二八年增为七十点二四卢布，一九二九年更增为七十七点零六卢布。工人社会保险的预算，从一九二六—一九二七年的九亿八千万卢布增加到一九二九—一九三○年的十四亿卢布。在同一时期，苏联城市的住宅建设，从一九二六年的三百二十二万五千八百平方公尺增加到一九二九年的四百七十四万一千一百平方公尺；苏联的初等和中等学校学生人数，从一九二五—一九二六年的一千零十九万三千九百人增加到一九二八—一九二九年的一千二百零七万四千八百人；初等职业学校学生人数从一九二五—一九二六年的五十二万八千六百人增加到一九二八—一九二九年的七十一万二千八百人。和此相反，在资本主义国家工业化的过程中，劳动人民则日益贫困和破产。比如，一八四三年，英国工人在国民收入中所占的份额为百分之四十五点六，而一八八四年只占百分之四十一点四，一九○三年只占百分之三十八点三。美国工人在全国生产品分配中所占的份额，从一八九九到一九一九年的二十年中，总共降低了百分之三十五。十九世纪六十年代，美国最贫困的居民已占全人口百分之六十五，他们仅占全国财富的百分之六点五，而百分之二的富人却占有全国财富的百分之五十六点九；经过二十年后，美国贫民数量不断增加，而属于他们的财富却从百分之六点五降到百分之五，属于富人的财富从百分之五十六点九增加到百分之六十六点六。特别值得我们注意的，就是资本主义国家的失业现象，并不因实现国家工业化而消灭。比如，英国失业人数从一九二八年的一百二十九万人增加到一九三二年的二百八十万人；德国失业人数由一九二八年的一百三十七万六千人增加到一九三二年的五百五十万人。美国工业化成就最大，而失业人数也最多，一九三二年末，美国全部工业中的失业工人数目，即有一千一百万人之多。但是，苏联实施工业化政策以后，在第一个五年计划中便根本铲除了失业现象。
    社会主义工业化所以导致劳动人民物质和文化生活的不断改善，资本主义工业化所以导致劳动人民日益贫困和破产，决不是偶然的。
    首先，社会主义工业化是在生产资料公有制的基础上进行的。生产资料公有制不仅提供工业化资金积累的广阔泉源，而且可以使工业化事业按照整个社会的利益来发展。社会主义工业化前进一步，就是意味着生产资料公有制扩大一步，就是意味着全民所有的财产增大，从而也就是意味着国家有更大的力量来扩大再生产和改善人民生活。恰恰相反，资本主义工业化是在资本主义生产资料私有制的基础上进行的。资本主义生产资料私有制不仅使资本主义工业化不能按照整个社会的利益来发展，而且使资产阶级与工人阶级及其他劳动人民之间的矛盾一天天扩大。资本主义工业化前进一步，就是意味着小生产者的日益破产和无产者的日益增多，意味着社会财富日益集中在资本家的手里，而广大劳动人民则日趋贫困。
    其次，社会主义工业化是由社会主义基本经济法则所决定的。社会主义工业化就是保证实现社会主义基本经济法则要求的主要手段。因为只有实现社会主义工业化，才能保证优先发展重工业，而只有重工业得到发展，才能在高度技术基础上改造整个国民经济，才能用头等的技术装备轻工业、食品工业、农业和交通运输业等物质生产部门，提高各个生产部门的劳动生产率，使社会主义生产能够不断增长和不断完善，以逐步实现最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化需要的目的。正因为这样，社会主义工业化前进一步，人民生活也必然会随着改善一步。而资本主义工业化又恰恰相反，它是受资本主义基本经济法则所支配的。资本主义基本经济法则决定了资产阶级发展工业的目的，不是为了改善人民生活，而是为了追求尽可能多的利润；也决定了资产阶级发展工业的手段，是尽情地剥削和掠夺国内外劳动人民。因此，资本主义工业化前进一步，只有给资产阶级带来更大的利润，给广大劳动人民带来更深的困苦和贫穷。
    再次，社会主义工业化的发展，又是受国民经济有计划（按比例）发展的法则制约着的。这一法则要求在国民经济的发展当中，国民经济各个部门和再生产的各个方面之间，都要保持一定的比例关系。因此，在社会主义工业化的发展过程中，随着社会主义工业部门的有计划的发展，其他国民经济部门也必然会按照国家统一的经济计划，相应地得到发展；同时，再生产的各个方面，也必然得到完善的配合，而不致相互脱节。比如，随着工业的有计划的发展，工业日益要求农业提供更多的粮食和原料，要求农村有更广阔的工业品销售市场，所以工业本身的发展，就要求相应地有计划地发展农业。而农业的发展，就是意味着农民收入的日益增多和生活的不断改善。和此相反，资本主义工业化是受竞争和生产无政府状态的法则支配着的。在这一法则的支配下，资本主义工业化不仅不可能有计划地发展，而且在它的发展过程中，必然会造成国民经济各个部门和再生产各个方面之间的不协调和不平衡现象。比如，在资本主义社会，经营工业比经营农业往往是更有利的，所以资本家竞相投资于工业，因而使工农业生产不能按比例发展，使农业远远落后于工业，并不得不忍受工业的剥削。在工业剥削农业的条件下，资本主义城市往往得到畸形的繁荣，而农村广大居民则日益贫困和破产。
    同时，社会主义工业化又是通过共产党和工人阶级的领导来实现的。人民的幸福生活是共产党和工人阶级一切行动的最高准则。党采取社会主义工业化的方针和政策，正是符合社会发展的规律，符合社会主义经济法则的要求，符合劳动人民的最高利益，也正是为了不断改善劳动人民的生活。相反地，资本主义工业化是通过资产阶级的掠夺和剥削来实现的。唯利是图是资产阶级一切行动的最高准则。他们决不会关心人民生活，也决不会利用资本主义工业化来为人民谋福利，来改善人民的生活。
    由此可见，社会主义工业化与改善人民的生活，是息息相关的，是具有客观的必然性的。
    社会主义工业化不仅必然会导致人民生活的不断改善，而且它本身的发展也必须以人民生活的不断改善为基础。因为只有劳动人民生活一天天富裕，才有更多的力量来购买工业品，从事储蓄，购买公债等，帮助国家积累工业化资金。所以从这方面看来，社会主义工业化发展的过程，也必然是人民生活不断改善的过程。
    二、人民生活的改善，又必须服从于生产的发展，服从于社会主义工业化事业的发展
    社会主义工业化的根本目的，固然是为了不断改善人民生活，但是，人民生活的改善，又必须服从于生产的发展，服从于社会主义工业化事业的发展。不难明白，如果生产得不到发展，人民的收入就不可能增加，生活就无法改善；同样不难明白，在社会主义改造时期，如果社会主义工业化得不到发展，整个国民经济就得不到改造，就会停留在落后的水平，人民的生活也就不可能改善。所以，生活的改善必须服从于生产的发展，服从于社会主义工业化事业的发展，而不应该过份地、片面地强调。曾经也有人不明白这一道理，主张在社会主义或共产主义条件下，劳动人民生产出来的东西，统统都应该归各人自己消费。比如，十九世纪中叶德国有名的机会主义政论家拉萨尔，就曾主张在社会主义条件下工人应该不打折扣地获得自己的全部劳动产品。马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中，详细地驳斥了拉萨尔的这种主张，认为这是一种非常有害的机会主义见解。按照马克思的科学预见，社会主义条件下的扩大再生产，是增加社会财富和改善人民生活的必要条件。马克思天才地制定了社会主义条件下社会基金的组成和用途的原理，规定从劳动者创造出来的全部社会产品中，首先应扣除：补偿已消费掉的生产资料的支出，扩大再生产的追加部分，以及形成后备基金和保险基金（用以防备意外事故和灾害）的部分。扣除了这些以后，社会产品的其余部分才被用作消费资料，但这部分消费资料在用作个人的分配之前，还必须从中扣除：“第一，一般的不属于生产的管理底费用。……第二，注定属于共同满足种种需要者，如教育卫生设备等等。……第三，对于无力劳动者的基金，简括地说，凡今天属于所谓官办的慈善事项。”（马克思：“哥达纲领批判”）此后，消费资料的其余部分，才按照各个工作人员劳动的数量和质量，为了个人消费的目的而进行分配。马克思认为花在用于个人消费以外的产品上的劳动，是同样必要的。事情非常明显，假使社会产品统统分配给各人自己消费的话，那么，社会扩大再生产便根本无法进行，社会主义工业化资金便根本无从积累，自然，也谈不上给国家提供必要的管理费用及其他费用。假使社会产品过多地分配给各人自己消费的话，那么，社会扩大再生产就会受到很大的影响，工业化资金的积累就会遭遇更多的困难，就会延缓社会主义工业化的实现。其结果，人民的生活也势必难于得到迅速的改善。
    同时，根据马克思关于在扩大再生产的条件下生产资料生产的增长占优先地位的原理，我们也可理解人民生活的改善必须服从于生产的发展，服从于社会主义工业化事业的发展，同样是一种客观的必然性。因为为了补偿生产过程中耗费的生产资料，为了在一切物质生产部门中扩大生产的规模，为了保证生产日益丰足的消费品来满足人民不断增长的生活需要，都要求生产资料生产部门不断提供足够的机器、装备品和原料。否则，不仅生产资料生产部门得不到发展，而且消费资料生产部门也不可能得到发展。所以国家在考虑发展生产时，任何时候都应该把发展生产资料的生产放在首要地位，都应该保证生产资料生产的增长占优先地位，而不应该离开发展生产资料生产的基础，片面地强调发展消费资料的生产，强调满足人民的生活需要。
    特别是在工业化初期，由于生产资料的生产一般都很落后，所以国家必须集中主要力量来首先着重发展重工业，而不可能也不应该用同样的力量来发展消费品的生产。因此，这时候，人民生活的改善更应该服从于生产的发展，服从于社会主义工业化事业的发展，使国家能积聚更多的资金来发展重工业。
    保证扩大社会主义再生产和着重发展重工业，必然会引起劳动人民购买力的迅速增长。这是因为扩大社会主义再生产和发展重工业，是在十分巨大的规模下进行的。国家为了不断扩大生产规模，为了建设无数的重工业企业，必须不断增加企业职工人数，收购大量的粮食和工业原料，结果国家为发展生产，为建设重工业而筹措的大量资金，要不是以工资的形式付给了工人，就是以收购农产品的形式付给了农民，从而引起了工人和农民购买力的大大增长。另一方面，又由于国家在任何时候都要保证扩大再生产，保证生产资料生产的增长占优先地位，而不应该不适当地、过份地扩大消费品的生产，所以就必然会出现消费品增长赶不上群众购买力增长的现象。斯大林就曾说过：“在苏联这里，群众消费额（购买力）的增长，总是超过生产额的增长”
  （“在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告”）。特别是在工业化初期，由于国家要集中主要力量发展重工业，来不及比较加速地发展消费品的生产，所以消费品增长赶不上购买力增长的现象，也就显得更加突出。苏联和我国工业化初期便是如此。比如，一九五三年我国棉布产量虽然比一九五二年增加了百分之二十七，可是由于广大人民群众对棉布的购买力更迅速地增长起来，以致同一时期棉布的市场销量竟增加了百分之四十七，因而出现了棉布供不应求的现象。
    针对这种情况，国家除了尽可能相应地发展消费品的生产以外，还必须采取一些必要的措施，来适当地解决消费品供应与需求之间的矛盾。比如，苏联从一九二八年底，开始在莫斯科和列宁格勒等城市实行食品的定量供应制，一九二九年，这种定量供应制便在全国各城市普遍实行；同时，从一九二九年起，苏联也开始实行了对布匹、衣服和肥皂等的定量供应制。我国从一九五三年冬季开始，实行了粮食的计划收购和计划供应的政策，从一九五四年九月十五日开始，实行了棉布的计划收购和计划供应和棉花的计划收购政策。这些措施，不仅可适当地解决供求矛盾，而且可以稳定物价，取缔市场投机，保证社会主义工业化事业的顺利进行。
    本来，如果我们懂得了改善生活必须服从于生产的发展、服从于社会主义工业化事业的发展这一道理的话，那么，对某些消费品供不应求的现象以及国家为解决供求矛盾所采取的一些措施，是容易理解并且愿意由衷地加以拥护的。但是，事实上，并不是每个人都能做到这一点。有些同志看到这种现象，便感到怀疑和不满。个别同志甚至牢骚满腹、惊惶失措，似乎把这看做是新社会的“奇灾大祸”。这些同志最好重温一下古比雪夫同志在苏联工业化初期所说的下面一段话：“商品缺乏并不是使我们惊惶失措的奇灾大祸。求过于供能推动工业迅速发展，这说明居民物质福利在提高，因而这是刺激工业化，刺激重工业发展的因素。”（“国家工业化的基本任务”）事实正是如此，我国从一九五三年起比较突出地呈现了商品缺乏的现象，但是一九五三年，我国社会购买力约提高了百分之二十左右，我国工业总产值较一九五二年增加了百分之三十三，其中重工业增加更快，这不正是说明居民福利在增长，工业化事业在突飞猛进地发展吗！
    也有一些同志，看到国家在集中主要力量发展重工业、实行社会主义工业化时所发生的升学困难、看戏拥挤、住宅拥挤、看病拥挤等等现象，他们又感到十分不满，又认为这是新社会不应该有的现象。他们没有想到，国家这几年来已经增加了许多学校、医院、文化娱乐场所和其他公用设备。比如，一九五三年全国中等学校学生较一九五二年增加了百分之十五，中央卫生部系统所属公立医院床位较一九五二年增加了百分之十八，电影院、文化馆和其他公共文化娱乐场所都有增加。只是由于革命胜利的结果，劳动人民从奴役的地位变成了主人，他们都开始要享受文化娱乐生活，所以处处显得很拥挤，而且随着他们的物质和文化生活要求的不断提高，国家虽会逐步添加许多文化和物质生活福利设备，但还是会拥挤。就像今天的苏联一样，去某些公共场所，还是难免要拥挤。但是，这种现象，又有什么不好呢？这正说明了新社会的兴旺繁荣气象，说明了人民生活在不断改善。
    自然，也有极少一部分人，比如投机商人，现在不能随意投机倒把，猎取非法利润，他们的生活要比过去降低，如果不改变这种行为的话，甚至还要难于维持生活；又比如有些过去在反动政府机关或官僚资本企业中充当过高级职员的人，现在不能保有过去那种高官厚禄，生活也要降低。但是这种现象，难道不是应该的吗？哪里又有什么值得大惊小怪的呢？
    总之，我们每一个人都应该从集体利益出发，认识改善生活必须服从于生产的发展，服从于社会主义工业化事业的发展这一原则，并且在实际生活中拿这一原则来衡量自己的觉悟水平，处理自己的生活，批判自己的错误思想，养成艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的生活作风。这样，我们伟大祖国的社会主义工业化事业就必将顺利地发展，我们的生活也就必将不断地获得改善。
