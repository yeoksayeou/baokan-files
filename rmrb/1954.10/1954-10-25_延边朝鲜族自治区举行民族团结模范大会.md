    Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region Holds National Unity Model Conference
    The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region of Jilin Province held its second National Unity Model Conference from October 15th to 18th. One hundred and ninety-five model figures of Korean, Han, Manchu, and other ethnic groups attended the conference. These models were elected at all levels, from villages, counties, and cities, on the basis of the ethnic unity work carried out in the autonomous region in September and October this year. Among them were unit model representatives and individual models from collective farms and factories. The models have become examples of mutual unity among all ethnic groups through mutual aid in production, mutual learning, and mutual respect for customs.
    At the meeting, Zhu Dehai, Secretary of the Yanbian Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Jilin Province and Chairman of the People's Government of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region of Jilin Province, and Vice Chairman Cui Cai, respectively made summary reports on ethnic policies and the ethnic work of the autonomous region in the past two years, and presented the models with award banners, certificates, and prizes, encouraging them to continue to strengthen and consolidate ethnic unity among all ethnic groups.
    At the meeting, the models learned from each other's model deeds and exchanged experiences through group and plenary discussions. They unanimously expressed that they would continue to study and publicize ethnic policies, pay more attention to ethnic characteristics in various production tasks, give better play to the spirit of friendship and unity among all ethnic groups, actively develop various constructions of the autonomous region, and transition to a socialist society together with the people of the whole country.
