    Unsurpassed and Profound Great Friendship

    During the visit of the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev to our country, China and the Soviet Union held talks and achieved results of great significance. The following documents were published as a result of this meeting: the Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Soviet Union on Various Issues of Sino-Soviet Relations and the International Situation, the Joint Declaration on Issues Related to Japan, the Joint Communiqué on the Withdrawal of Soviet Troops from the Jointly Used Chinese Naval Base of Port Arthur and the Return of the Base to the Complete Control of the People's Republic of China, the Joint Communiqué on the Transfer of Soviet Shares in Joint Stock Companies to the People's Republic of China, the Joint Communiqué on the Signing of an Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, the Joint Communiqué on the Construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty Railway, and the Joint Communiqué of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia on the Construction of a Railway from Jining to Ulaanbaatar and the Organization of Joint Transportation; at the same time, an agreement was also signed on a long-term loan of 520 million rubles from the Soviet government to the government of the People's Republic of China, and a protocol on the Soviet government assisting the government of the People's Republic of China in building 15 new Chinese industrial enterprises and expanding the scope of equipment supply for the 141 enterprises stipulated in the original agreement. This marks a new development in the unparalleled and profound great friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

    The outcome of this meeting once again vividly reflects the unanimous wishes and common interests of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union. It will further promote close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, thereby promoting the consolidation of peace in the Far East and the world.

    As early as February 17, 1950, when the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The full understanding and deep friendship established on the basis of the fundamental interests of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union is difficult to describe in words. People can see that the unity of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, which has already been fixed by the treaty, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice in the world." The vivid facts of the past and the results of the Sino-Soviet talks today have eloquently proved this truth.

    The consistent wishes of China and the Soviet Union are manifested in international affairs, as the joint declaration of the two governments solemnly states: "The two governments have a consistent desire to continue to participate in all international activities aimed at consolidating peace, and to consult with each other on issues related to the common interests of China and the Soviet Union, so as to achieve unity of action in defending the security of the two countries and maintaining peace in the Far East and the world."

    The two countries unanimously believe that the Geneva Conference has promoted the restoration of peace in Indochina and is of great significance; it is necessary to discuss the Korean issue at a conference with broad participation of various countries in the near future; the two countries will continue to develop relations with various countries in Asia and the Pacific region and other countries on the basis of strict adherence to the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, so as to open up broad avenues for international friendly cooperation; the two countries are willing to do everything possible to promote the resolution of various outstanding international issues.

    The two countries unanimously believe that the current policy of the US leading group to obstruct the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations, to continue to occupy China's territory Taiwan and support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, to continue to maintain the division of Korea, and to piece together aggressive military blocs in Southeast Asia, runs counter to the task of maintaining peace in the Far East and easing international tension.

    In the joint declaration of the Sino-Soviet governments on relations with Japan, the two countries reiterated their friendship and sympathy for the Japanese people, pointing out that Japan's way out is to liberate itself from the position of dependence on foreign countries and to devote itself to establishing normal relations with its neighbors; "Japan will receive the full support of China and the Soviet Union in its efforts to establish political and economic relations, with China and the Soviet Union, and similarly, all steps taken by Japan to safeguard the conditions for its peaceful and independent development will also receive the full support of China and the Soviet Union." The Japanese people's struggle for national independence and peace and democracy is not isolated and has a bright future.

    From here, people can clearly see that the consistency of China and the Soviet Union is based on the consistency of the desire to maintain the cause of peace; and such consistency is based on the further close cooperation between the two countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, which is in the fundamental interests of the people of all countries, including the people of Asia.

    Obviously, the consistent policy adopted by China and the Soviet Union towards the current international situation is a manifestation of the common will of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union, and cannot be defeated by war instigators. In the face of the increasingly consolidated friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, how ugly and shameless the imperialist policies of aggression and war appear! Imperialists are trying their best to distort and slander the peaceful foreign policy of China and the Soviet Union, and do not hesitate to use all despicable means to provoke relations between China and the Soviet Union. The American masters are frantically spreading rumors, saying either that "the Soviet Union is trying to control China" or that "the Soviet Union is implementing annexation in the northeastern region of China." They have not hesitated to take risks to carry out armed intervention and war threats against our country from the battle lines of Korea and Indochina, but they say that this is "friendship" to the Chinese people. However, their arrogant conspiracies have failed one after another.

    Imperialists once nonsensically said that the joint use of the Port Arthur naval base by China and the Soviet Union was a so-called "aggression" by the Soviet Union. The Chinese people clearly know that when our country was first established, our national defense forces were weak, and the American aggressors were supporting the Japanese militarist forces to intensify their threats to our country. At that time, according to the agreement concluded between China and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union and our country jointly used the Port Arthur naval base. Later, the Soviet Union accepted the request of our government and agreed to extend the period for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Port Arthur. For our country, this was necessary for national defense and was very beneficial, but it was very unfavorable to the American imperialist aggression conspiracy. Now, because the situation in the Far East and the world has changed, Indochina has restored peace after the Korean War, and our national defense forces are increasingly consolidated, the Soviet Union has proposed to withdraw Soviet troops from Port Arthur before the end of May next year and transfer the equipment in the area to our government free of charge. When our country, especially our Northeast, was in serious danger of being invaded, Soviet troops helped us defend the strategic fortress of Port Arthur. When our national defense forces have grown up, Soviet troops immediately withdrew from Port Arthur and handed over various equipment of the naval base to our country free of charge. Has such a brotherly relationship between the two countries ever appeared in the history of China's international relations in the past 100 years? This selfless assistance provided by the Soviet government for our country to consolidate its national defense security has never happened in history and is impossible in the capitalist world. The socialist Soviet Union respects the sovereignty of other countries in this way, which is a vivid contrast to the bloody facts of American imperialism everywhere seizing military bases, piecing together aggressive military blocs, interfering in other countries' internal affairs, and implementing armed occupation!

    In terms of mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union to promote the economic and cultural development of the two countries, imperialists are also carrying out shameless slander and vilification, and even wantonly try to describe the huge and generous assistance provided by the Soviet Union in various aspects to our country's economic recovery and socialist industrialization as "aggression" and "control." Imperialists and their running dogs妄想 to deceive the Chinese people and undermine the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Now iron facts have once again proved the complete bankruptcy of their slander and vilification.

    The Chinese people will never forget that when the young People's Republic of China was facing the difficult period of restoring the national economy, at the same time as the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet Union decided to provide our country with a loan of 300 million US dollars with preferential conditions of an annual interest rate of 1%, which was used to pay for the various modern machinery and equipment delivered to our country by the Soviet Union, which were necessary for our economic construction. Subsequently, China and the Soviet Union jointly established the Xinjiang Non-ferrous Metals Company, the Xinjiang Petroleum Company, and the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company, and jointly operated the Dalian Shipyard, using the advanced experience and superior technical conditions of Soviet economic construction to establish or develop the work of these companies in a short period of time, so that these modern enterprises have played a positive role in the cause of restoring and developing our economy. Imperialistists often use the method of investing in colonies and semi-colonies to carry out economic aggression, but the socialist Soviet Union's investment in these four companies is completely of another nature and for another purpose. This purpose is to use Soviet funds and technology to help our country develop the resources that we were unable to develop at that time or enterprises that were difficult to operate, so as to establish a basis for our country to be completely independent economically. Everyone knows that during the period when China and the Soviet Union jointly managed the Chinese Changchun Railway, with the direct help of more than 1,000 Soviet experts, the railway was well managed, a complete set of railway construction experience was created, and more than 20,000 management and technical personnel were trained for the new China's railway construction. After this task was completed, the Soviet Union handed over the Chinese Changchun Railway to our country for its own management free of charge. Now, the Soviet Union is transferring the Soviet shares in the remaining four Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies to our country. Such a thing cannot be done by any capitalist country. The Soviet government helped to build the jointly operated enterprises well, cultivated talents, and taught us experience, and then it transferred the enterprises to our country and completely owned them by our country. If we compare such facts with the economic aggression of imperialism in the old China era, how can our people not be infinitely grateful for the sincere and generous assistance given to our country by the Soviet Union!

    Our country, together with the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic, agreed to build and accelerate the completion of the railway from Jining in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of our country to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, and connect it with the railway from Ulaanbaatar to the Soviet Union; and decided to build the railway from Lanzhou in our country to Almaty in the Soviet Union, which will greatly facilitate our country's economic construction and greatly facilitate the cooperation and mutual support between China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet government also signed an agreement with our country on a long-term loan of 520 million rubles from the Soviet government to the government of the People's Republic of China, and a protocol on the Soviet government assisting the government of the People's Republic of China in building 15 new Chinese industrial enterprises and expanding the scope of supply for the 141 enterprises stipulated in the original agreement. The Soviet government also decided to donate a large number of machines and equipment to our people to organize a large state-owned grain farm with a sowing area of 20,000 hectares, and to give the machine tools and agricultural machines exhibited in the Soviet Exhibition Hall in Beijing to our country. The Soviet government also signed an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation with our country. This series of facts also proves that the brotherly friendship between China and the Soviet Union is unparalleled.

    This Sino-Soviet meeting dealt a fatal blow to the imperialists' nonsense of so-called "Soviet aggression against China." It will enable the Chinese people, and also the people of all countries in the world, to see the fundamental difference between the socialist Soviet Union and capitalist countries. The imperialist liars and provocateurs can rest! The economic and cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union will flourish and develop. This cooperative relationship is a new type of international relationship of equality and mutual benefit. This is completely opposite to the relationship between the reactionary Chinese government and imperialist countries. Therefore, the cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has unlimited development prospects and cannot be destroyed by any reactionary force.

    The Chinese people express their infinite gratitude to the Soviet government, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Soviet people for their meticulous, large-scale, and comprehensive assistance. At the same time, the responsibilities of all cadres and workers in our economic departments are even greater. We should intensify our study of the Soviet people's valuable experience in building socialism and the great spirit of their creative labor. On the basis of the achievements already made in the past two years of our country's first five-year plan, we must give full play to our own strength and invest more confidently in the high tide of our country's socialist construction. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report at the memorial meeting for the 30th anniversary of Lenin's death, "Because we have the tested and ever-victorious Leninism to guide us, the Central Committee and the Central People's Government of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong to lead us, the rich experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism as our example, and the selfless assistance given to us by our great ally, the Soviet Union, as long as we learn modestly and work cautiously and bravely, we will surely be able to make our country's great cause of building a socialist country achieve complete victory."

    The outcome of this Sino-Soviet meeting will be universally welcomed by all progressive mankind, and will be another heavy blow to the enemies of peace. The Chinese people, with joy and infinite gratitude, hail the great achievements of the Sino-Soviet meeting, hail the further development of Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation, and hail the new efforts made by China and the Soviet Union to defend peace.

    无比深厚的伟大友谊
    在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府代表团访问我国的期间，中苏双方举行了会谈，取得了具有重大意义的结果。这次会谈，公布了下列文件：中华人民共和国政府和苏联政府关于中苏关系和国际形势各项问题的联合宣言、关于对日本关系问题的联合宣言、关于苏军自共同使用的中国旅顺口海军根据地撤退并将该根据地交还中华人民共和国完全支配的联合公报、关于将各股份公司中的苏联股份移交给中华人民共和国的联合公报、关于签订科学技术合作协定的联合公报、关于修建兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路的联合公报和中苏蒙三国关于修建从集宁到乌兰巴托的铁路并组织联运的联合公报；同时还签订了关于苏联政府给予中华人民共和国政府五亿二千万卢布长期贷款的协定、关于苏联政府帮助中华人民共和国政府新建十五项中国工业企业和扩大原有协定规定的一百四十一项企业设备的供应范围的议定书。这是中苏两国之间无比深厚的伟大友谊的新发展的标志。
    这个会谈的结果，再一次鲜明地反映了中苏两国八万万人民的一致愿望和共同利益。它将进一步促进中苏两国之间的密切合作，从而促进远东及世界和平的巩固。
    毛泽东同志早在一九五○年二月十七日中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的时候就说过：“在中苏两大国人民根本利益的基础上所建立起来的充分了解与深厚友谊，是难以用言语来形容的。人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利”。过去的生动事实，和今天中苏两国会谈的结果，都雄辩地证明了这个真理。
    中苏两国的一致愿望，表现在对国际事务方面，正如两国政府联合宣言郑重地表明的：“两国政府具有一致的愿望，将继续参加一切旨在巩固和平的国际活动，并对有关中苏两国共同利益的问题，彼此进行协商，以便在保卫两国安全和维护远东和世界和平方面，取得行动的一致”。
    两国一致认为，日内瓦会议促成了印度支那和平的恢复，具有重要意义；朝鲜问题有必要在最近的将来召开有各国广泛参加的会议来加以讨论；两国将继续在严格遵守互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则的基础上，发展同亚洲及太平洋区域的各个国家以及其他国家的关系，为国际友好合作开辟广泛的途径；两国愿尽一切力量促进各项悬而未决的国际问题的解决。
    两国一致认为，目前美国领导集团阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国中取得合法地位、继续侵占中国领土台湾和支持蒋介石卖国集团、继续保持朝鲜的分裂局面和拼凑东南亚侵略军事集团的政策，是同维护远东和平和缓和国际紧张局势的任务背道而驰的。
    在中苏两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言中，两国重申了对日本人民的友好和同情，指出日本的出路是从依附外国的地位中解放出来，致力于建立同邻国的正常关系；“日本在致力同中华人民共和国和苏联建立政治关系和经济关系方面，将会得到中苏方面完全的支持，同样地，日本方面为保障它的和平和独立发展的条件所采取的一切步骤，也将会得到中苏方面完全的支持”。日本人民争取民族独立和和平民主的斗争，不是孤立的，是有光明前途的。
    从这里，人们可以清楚地看见，中苏两国的一致，是基于对维护和平事业的愿望的一致；而这样的一致是建立在两国根据平等互利、互相尊重国家主权和领土完整而进一步密切合作的基础之上的，是符合各国人民包括亚洲人民在内的根本利益的。
    很显然，中苏两国对当前国际局势所采取的这个一致的政策，是中苏两国八亿人民的共同意志的表现，是战争挑拨者所不能战胜的。在中苏两国日益巩固的友谊和合作关系面前，帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策是显得多么的丑恶和无耻啊！帝国主义者竭力企图歪曲和诽谤中苏两国的和平外交政策，并不惜采取一切卑鄙手段来挑拨中苏两国的关系。美国老爷们拚命造谣，不是说“苏联企图控制中国”，就是说“苏联正在中国东北部地区实行合并”。他们曾不惜冒险来从朝鲜和印度支那的战线上对我国进行武装干涉和战争威胁，却说什么这是对中国人民的“友谊”。可是，它们的狂妄阴谋一个一个失败了。
    帝国主义者曾胡说中苏共同使用旅顺口海军根据地是所谓苏联的“侵略”。中国人民清楚地知道，在我们的国家刚成立的时候，我们的国防力量是薄弱的，美国侵略者则正在扶植日本军国主义势力加紧威胁我国，当时根据中苏两国缔结的协定，苏联与我国共同使用旅顺口海军根据地，后来苏联又接受我国政府的要求，同意延长苏联军队自旅顺口撤退的期限，这对我国说来，是国防上必需的，是很有利的，只有对于美帝国主义的侵略阴谋是很不利的。现在，由于远东和世界形势起了变化，朝鲜战争停止后印度支那也恢复了和平，我国国防力量日益巩固，苏联就提出在明年五月底以前把苏联军队从旅顺口撤走，并将该地区的设备无偿地移交我国政府。当我国特别是我国东北有被侵略的严重危险的时候，苏联军队帮助我们守住旅顺口这一战略要塞。当我国国防力量已经成长的时候，苏联军队立即从旅顺口撤退，把海军根据地的各种设备无偿地交给我国。两国之间这样的兄弟般的关系，在一百多年来中国的国际关系史上曾经出现过么？苏联政府为我国巩固国防安全所作的这种无私的援助，是历史上从来没有过的，是资本主义世界里所决不可能有的。社会主义的苏联这样尊重别国的主权，这和美帝国主义到处强占军事基地、拼凑侵略军事集团、干涉别国内政、实行武装占领等等血淋淋的事实是多么鲜明的对照啊！
    在中苏两国互相援助，以促进两国经济和文化的发展方面，帝国主义者同样进行着无耻的诽谤和污蔑，甚至对于苏联从各方面给予我国恢复经济和社会主义工业化建设的巨大的慷慨援助，也妄想说成是“侵略”、“控制”。帝国主义者及其走狗妄想欺骗中国人民，破坏中苏两国的友谊。现在铁的事实又一次证明了他们的诽谤和污蔑的彻底破产。
    中国人民永远不会忘记，当年青的中华人民共和国面临着恢复国民经济的艰难时期，在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的同时，苏联就决定以年利百分之一的优惠条件贷款三亿美元给我国，用以偿付我国经济建设所必需的由苏联交付我国的各种现代化的机器装备。接着中苏两国又先后合股创办了新疆的有色金属公司、新疆的石油公司和中苏民用航空公司，并合股经营了大连造船公司，用苏联经济建设的先进经验和优越的技术条件在短期内建立或发展了这些公司的工作，使这些现代化的企业在恢复和发展我国经济的事业中起了积极的作用。帝国主义者常常用在殖民地半殖民地投资的方法进行经济侵略，但社会主义苏联投资于这四个公司，完全是另外一种性质，为了另外一种目的，这个目的就是以苏联的资金和技术帮助我国开发我们当时无力开发的富源或难以经营的企业，以便为我国建立起在经济上完全独立的基础。大家都知道，中苏两国共管中国长春铁路的时期，在一千多个苏联专家的直接帮助下办好了这条铁路，创造出了一套完整的铁路建设经验，并为新中国铁路建设培养了二万多名管理人员和技术人员。这个任务完成之后，苏联就把中国长春铁路无偿地交还我国自己管理。现在，苏联又把尚余的四个中苏合股公司中的苏联股份移交我国。这样的事情，也是任何资本主义国家所不能做到的。苏联政府帮助把共同经营的企业建设好了，人才也培养出来了，经验也教给我们了，它就把企业移交给我国，完全归我国所有。如果把这样的事实，来和帝国主义在旧中国时代的经济侵略作一对比，我国人民对于苏联给予我国的真诚慷慨的援助怎么能够不万分感谢呢！
    我国同苏联和蒙古人民共和国议定修建和加快完成从我国内蒙古自治区的集宁到达蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴托的铁路，与乌兰巴托到苏联的铁路接轨；并决定修建从我国兰州到达苏联阿拉木图的铁路，将会大大便利于我国的经济建设，大大便利于中苏两国的合作和互相支援。苏联政府还和我国签订了关于苏联给予中华人民共和国政府五亿二千万卢布长期贷款的协定，和关于苏联政府帮助中华人民共和国政府新建十五项中国工业企业和扩大原有协定的一百四十一项企业的供应范围的议定书。苏联政府又决定赠送大批机器和装备给我国人民以组织拥有两万公顷播种面积的大型国营谷物农场，并把正在北京苏联展览馆内展览的机床和农业机器等送给我国。苏联政府还和我国签订了科学技术合作的协定。这一系列事实也都证明中苏两国的兄弟友谊是无比深厚的。
    此次中苏会谈，把帝国主义者的所谓“苏联侵略中国”的胡说，给了致命的打击。它将使中国人民，也将使全世界各国人民，看到社会主义苏联和资本主义国家之间的根本不同之点。帝国主义的谎言家和挑拨者可以休矣！中苏两国的经济和文化的合作，将日益繁荣发展。这个合作关系是一种平等互利的新型的国际关系。这跟中国反动政府和帝国主义国家之间的关系截然相反。因此，中苏两国的合作是有无限发展前途的，是任何反动势力所不能摧毁的。
    中国人民对于苏联政府、苏联共产党和苏联人民无微不至的巨大规模的全面的援助，表示无限的感谢。同时，我们经济部门的全体干部和工人的责任也更加重大了。我们应该加紧学习苏联人民建设社会主义的宝贵经验和他们的创造性劳动的伟大精神。在我国第一个五年建设计划两年来已得成就的基础上，我们必须充分发挥自己的力量，更有信心地投入我国社会主义建设的高潮中去。正如刘少奇同志在列宁逝世三十周年纪念大会上的报告中所指出的，“因为有久经考验的、百战百胜的列宁主义指导我们，有以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央和中央人民政府领导我们，有苏联建设社会主义的丰富经验作我们的榜样，并且有我们伟大的盟邦苏联给予我们以无私的帮助，所以只要我们虚心地学习，谨慎而勇敢地工作，我们就一定能够使我国建成为社会主义国家的伟大事业取得完全的胜利。”
    这次中苏两国会谈的结果，将得到全体进步人类的普遍欢迎，而对和平的敌人则是又一次沉重的打击。中国人民怀抱着欢欣鼓舞和无限感谢的心情，欢呼中苏两国会谈的重大成就，欢呼中苏两国友好合作的进一步发展，欢呼中苏两国为保卫和平而作出的新的努力。
