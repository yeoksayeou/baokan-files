Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 4 and State-Owned Cement Factory No. 7
Respectively Complete Annual Production Value and Output Plans Ahead of Schedule
	By the end of September, Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 4 had completed its annual production value plan, and the profits turned over to the state exceeded the annual plan by more than double. Compared with January to September of last year, this year's production value increased by 67.9 percent.
	The main reason Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 4 completed its plan ahead of schedule was the labor competition focused on technological innovation. From January to September of this year, the factory's employees proposed 634 rationalization proposals, of which 185 have been implemented and 28 are being tested. After the distillation team increased processing volume and implemented a continuous coal burning method, the distillation time was shortened, and monthly output could increase by more than 30 percent. The hard carbon black team created a method of repairing without shutting down the furnace, which greatly improved equipment utilization. After the entire factory promoted the advanced experience of scientific and safe operation from Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 6, safe production was ensured.
	Now, all employees of Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 4 have put forward new production increase plans. (Xinhua News Agency)

	State-Owned Cement Factory No. 7 completed its annual cement output plan 79 days ahead of schedule. Production costs from January to September were 4.25 percent lower than the state plan.
	This factory successfully trial-produced many new products this year, such as white cement, sulfate-resistant cement, No. 600 high-grade cement, and mixed cement, promptly meeting the needs of more than 390 construction engineering units such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Yumen Oil Mine, and the Beijing Soviet Exhibition Hall.
	In the process of completing the annual production plan ahead of schedule, the workers put forward more than 590 rationalization proposals. The employees of the calcination workshop, as an important link in the entire factory, conscientiously studied advanced Soviet experiences such as "fast rotary kiln," "high-temperature kiln coating," and "long-term rotary kiln," overcoming many key difficulties, so that equipment that had exceeded one to two depreciation periods was able to exert new power. In the past, the rotary kiln was repaired almost once a month, but this year there was a new record of continuous operation for five to seven months. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北石油四厂和国营第七水泥厂
    分别提前完成全年生产总值和产量计划
    到九月底，东北石油四厂已完成了全年的生产总值计划；上缴利润也超过全年计划的一倍以上。和去年一至九月份比较，今年的生产总值增长了百分之六十七点九。
    东北石油四厂提前完成计划的原因，主要是开展了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛。今年一至九月份，全厂职工提出了六百三十四件合理化建议，其中已经实现的一百八十五件，正在试验的二十八件。厂内的蒸馏班加大处理量和推行了连续烧煤法后，缩短了蒸馏时间，每月产量可增加百分之三十以上；硬质碳黑班创造了不停炉检修的方法，大大提高了设备运用率。全厂推广了东北石油六厂的科学安全运行法先进经验后，保证了安全生产。
    现在，东北石油四厂全体职工又提出新的增产计划。（新华社）

    国营第七水泥厂提前七十九天完成了水泥的全年产量计划。一月到九月的生产成本比国家计划降低百分之四点二五。
    这个厂在今年试制成功了白色水泥、抗硫酸盐水泥、六百号高级水泥和混合水泥等不少新产品，及时地满足了鞍山钢铁公司、第一汽车制造厂、玉门油矿和北京苏联展览馆等三百九十多个建筑工程单位的需要。
    工人们在提前完成全年生产计划的过程中，曾提出五百九十多件合理化建议。作为全厂重要环节的烧成车间的职工认真学习了“快速转窑”、“高温挂窑皮”和“长期转窑”等苏联先进经验，克服了许多关键性的困难，使得已经超过一个到两个折旧年限的设备，发挥出了新的力量。回转窑在过去几乎是一个月一检修，今年却出现了连续运转五个月到七个月的新纪录。（新华社）
