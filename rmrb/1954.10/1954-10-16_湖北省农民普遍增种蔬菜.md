Hubei Province Farmers Universally Increase Vegetable Planting

Hubei Province farmers, under the principle of not affecting the planting area of ​​grain and oil crops, are making full use of vacant land and intercropping methods to extensively plant vegetables. In many areas, the plan has been largely completed. Echeng County originally planned to plant 120,000 mu of vegetables, and has completed 100,000 mu. Statistics from non-disaster areas in seven counties in Jingzhou Prefecture show that more than 280,000 mu of vegetables have been planted.

Increasing vegetable production is one of the main contents of increasing grain production in Hubei Province this year. The Provincial Department of Agriculture formulated a plan at the end of August to increase vegetable production by 10 billion jin throughout the province. If this plan is realized, it will be equivalent to increasing rice production by 2.4 billion jin, which can greatly shorten the duration of the spring famine in disaster areas next year.

At present, Party committees and agricultural departments at all levels are strengthening ideological mobilization and technical guidance for increasing vegetable production while arranging winter planting work, in order to strive for the realization of the vegetable production increase plan.

    湖北省农民普遍增种蔬菜
    湖北省农民在不影响粮食、油料作物播种面积的原则下，充分利用空地和间作法，广泛种植蔬菜。许多地区，已大部完成计划。鄂城县原计划种蔬菜十二万亩，已完成十万亩，荆州专区七个县非灾地区统计，已种植蔬菜二十八万多亩。
    增产蔬菜是湖北省今年增产粮食的主要内容之一，省农业厅在八月底曾制订全省增产蔬菜一百亿斤的计划。如果这个计划实现，就相当于增产二十四亿斤稻谷，可以大大缩短灾区明年春荒的时间。
    现在，各级党委和农业部门在布置冬播工作的同时，都加强增产蔬菜工作的思想发动，和技术指导。以争取蔬菜增产计划的实现。
