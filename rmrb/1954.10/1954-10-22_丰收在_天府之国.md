    Bumper Harvest in the "Land of Abundance"
  　By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen
    Sichuan Province, the largest grain producer in the country, has had its fifth bumper harvest this year after consecutive years of good harvests since liberation. The province's total grain output has increased by more than 2.32 billion jin compared to last year (the historical peak). This accounts for more than one-tenth of the country's total grain output. Sichuan's bumper harvest is of particularly significant importance in supporting disaster areas and national industrial construction. The grain produced in 145 counties, excluding what the farmers consume themselves, is estimated that the grain sold to the state alone, if used for disaster relief, could feed more than 24 million disaster victims for a year; if used to invest in industrial and transportation construction, it could build six Chengdu-Chongqing railways spanning Sichuan.
    Sichuan has fertile land and a mild climate, and all kinds of crops from the south and the north are available. People affectionately call it the "Land of Abundance." In the mountainous areas surrounding the basin and the hilly areas along the Yangtze River stretching for thousands of miles, in addition to rice, there are also abundant sorghum, corn, cotton, sweet potatoes, and various local specialties. In the terraced fields surrounding the slopes, the ripe crops are like shimmering pieces of brocade, repeating from the top of the mountain to the foot. This year, many places have increased production by more than 10%. On the rich and beautiful Chengdu Plain in western Sichuan, there are 6.3 million mu of rice fields, famous throughout the country for their flue-cured tobacco, hemp, chuanxiong, and rapeseed, rising and falling one after another, surging and surging like a golden ocean. The bumper harvest is not only in the hinterland, but also on the vast grasslands of northwestern Sichuan. The more than one million mu of highland barley, wheat, and corn in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province have generally increased production by 10% to 20%. In Wulibao, Songpan County, only more than 40 households have harvested an additional 21,000 jin of highland barley this year. In the entire province, in addition to grain, cotton, sweet potatoes, fruits, etc. are all having bumper harvests. People say: This year is truly a time of flourishing things and a harvest of all grains!
    But bumper harvests are not easy to achieve. In the spring, when the spring drought had not yet appeared, more than 100,000 Communist Party members throughout the province led farmers in building and repairing more than 320,000 water conservancy projects, ensuring full planting and transplanting, and turning 800,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Communist Party member Jiang Dayou of Dazi Village, Bishan County, ran to the mountains on a stormy night to block and repair the dikes, diverting rainwater into the dry seedling fields. Later, he personally helped the masses spray medicine to eliminate pests. The seedlings grew particularly strong and lush. With the meticulous cultivation of the masses, 700 mu of rice increased production by 25,000 jin. Poor peasant Wang Tiancai, who harvested only 1,700 jin last year, harvested 2,400 jin of grain this year. He said: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no bumper harvest!" Farmers in the Dujiangyan irrigation area especially appreciated the two steel and concrete projects built by the state in Dujiangyan during the days of the bumper harvest. In the summer, when the corn tassels were spitting and the rice was blooming, it was these solid projects that tamed the raging floods and let them flow obediently into more than 260 canals. Party committees in Wenjiang, Xinfan, and other places also led tens of thousands of people in heroic struggles day and night when dangers occurred in places such as Yushidi and Sanhecha, and finally overcame the rare flood and defended the bumper harvest of the plain. But in 1933 and 1936, this fertile land was submerged in floods! Mutual aid and cooperation organizations have played a great role in promoting agricultural production. Under the leadership of more than 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives and 990,000 mutual aid teams, farmers throughout the province generally selected improved varieties, increased fertilization, improved cultivation techniques, and reduced the damage of pests and diseases, so that the yield per unit area of various crops this year has generally been improved. In Heden Township, Xinfan County, which has basically been cooperativized, the average yield of rice per mu has increased by 45 jin compared to last year. The 46 agricultural production cooperatives in the township are all frequently reporting good news of bumper harvests. In the days of the bumper harvest, what is forever unforgettable is that this year, in addition to receiving large amounts of loans, new agricultural tools, and chemical fertilizer assistance from the state, Soviet agricultural experts who were far away from their hometowns also came to their fields to guide them in improving fertilization and rice cultivation methods; tractors from state-owned farms also came to help them cultivate the land. At that time, people still did not believe in these new things, and individual backward farmers even released water in the fields, not allowing tractors to drive into the fields. But today, they are standing in rice paddies that are waist-deep, cheering for the victory of new technologies! Fields cultivated with new agricultural tools and new methods have yielded 50 to 60 jin more grain per mu than in the past. Facts have educated farmers to recognize science and truth. As Shi Liangchen, the director of Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative, which harvested 700,000 jin of rice, said, everyone has seen the future socialist prospects from the benefits of cooperativization and new agricultural tools.
    During the autumn harvest, the broad masses of farmers launched a struggle to increase the grain harvest. "Half for the sky, half for the earth," in the past, an average of 20 jin had to be scattered per mu. This year, in order to reduce scattering and mildew losses, various places have generally improved harvesting methods. In the golden fields, the rice stalks were cut shorter than in the past, the rice bundles were placed lighter, and canopies, mats, and cloth pockets were added to the threshing bins. The newly created wooden improved threshing machines are being shaken by male and female farmers, like small boats in gentle waves; it can not only reduce scattering to a minimum, but also reduce physical labor, allowing women to participate in threshing, and increase the harvest rate to more than 40%. In Fushun and Longchang counties alone, the rice saved and increased due to careful harvesting reached more than 20 million jin. In order to make up for the losses in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River disaster area, various places are actively planting a season of late autumn crops while harvesting autumn crops. The fields that have just been harvested are now a verdant green. Farmers are constantly fertilizing and weeding, and continuing to work hard to strive for another 700 million jin of grain production.
    Sichuan farmers, with boundless joy of harvest, are now enthusiastically selling grain to the state. At the gates of warehouses and grain purchasing stations in various places, farmers who pay public grain and sell surplus grain have been crowded since before dawn. In the collective grain selling teams, gongs and drums are beating, and bright red flags are flying. In order to sell the best grain to the state, the Qinggang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bishan selected the most plump rice ears during the autumn harvest, and put them separately, cut them separately, threshed them separately, and cleaned them with a windmill four times. On the day of collective grain delivery, more than 200 men and women carried the burdens on their shoulders and backs, and quickly deposited 150,000 jin of yellow grain into the warehouse. Farmer Wang Xinliang said: "As long as we eat a little more miscellaneous grains and sweet potatoes, we can sell hundreds of kilograms more rice to support the disaster areas!" In order to support the disaster areas, Sichuan people have already transported and will soon transport more than 1.2 million tons of grain last year and this year. The transportation army composed of countless ships, wooden boats, cars, and horse-drawn carts is heading towards the disaster area along the Yangtze River and highways in a mighty manner. What they are sending is not only grain, but also the hearts of 60 million people in Sichuan!

    丰收在“天府之国”
  　本报记者　纪希晨
    全国产粮最多的四川省，在解放以来连年丰收之后，今年又第五次丰收了。全省粮食总产量比去年（历史上的最高水平）增产了二十三亿二千多万斤。占全国粮食总产量的十分之一多。四川的丰收，对支援灾区和国家工业建设有着特别重大的意义。一百四十五个县所产的粮食，除农民自己食用外，预计单缴售给国家的粮食，如若用来救灾，可供应二千四百多万灾民食用一年；如若用来投资工业交通建设，则可修筑六条横贯四川的成渝铁路。
    四川土地肥沃，气候温和，南方和北方的各种作物应有尽有，人们亲切地称呼她为“天府之国”。在环抱着盆地的山区，和绵延千里的长江两岸丘陵中，除了稻米，还盛产高粱、玉米、棉花、番薯和各种土特产。围绕着山坡的层层叠叠的梯田里，黄熟了的庄稼，像一块块闪光的锦缎，从山顶一直重复到山脚，今年许多地方都增产了一成多。富饶美丽的川西平原上，产有闻名全国的烤烟、麻、川芎和菜籽，六百三十万亩水稻，此起彼伏，汹涌澎湃，如同一片金黄色的海洋。丰收不仅在腹地，而且还展现在川西北辽阔的草原上。四川省藏族自治区的
  一百多万亩青稞、小麦、玉麦，普遍增产一成至两成，松潘县五里堡仅四十多户人家，今年多收青稞两万一千斤。全省除了粮食，其他棉花、番薯、水果等莫不丰收。人们说：今年真是百物盛茂，五谷丰登哩！
    但丰收并不是容易取得的。春天，当春旱还未露头的时候，全省十多万名共产党员带领农民，新建和整修三十二万多处水利工程，保证了满栽满插，并使八十万亩旱地变成了水田。璧山县大字村共产党员蒋大有，在暴风雨的黑夜里，跑到山上去堵修堤坎，将雨水引入干旱的秧田里，后来他又亲自帮助群众喷洒药粉，消灭了虫害，秧子长得特别茁壮茂密，在群众精耕细作下，七百亩水稻增产两万五千斤。去年只收了一千七百斤的贫农王天才，今年收谷两千四百斤，他说：“没有共产党那会有这丰收哩！”都江堰流域一带的农民，在丰收的日子里，特别感念国家在都江堰修起的两座钢骨水泥工程。夏天，当遍野玉麦吐须水稻扬花的时候，正是这些坚固的工程使暴涨的洪水，驯服地流入二百六十多条干渠里。温江、新繁等各地党委，在玉石堤、三河岔等地发生险情时，又带领数万群众，日夜英勇搏斗，终于战胜了罕有的大水，保卫了平原的丰收。而在一九三三年和一九三六年，这里的一片沃野却被淹在洪水里！互助合作组织对促进农业增产起了很大作用。在八千多个农业生产合作社和九十九万个互助组带动下，全省农民普遍选用良种，增多施肥，改进耕作技术，减轻了病虫的危害，使今年各样作物的单位面积产量，普遍得到提高。基本合作化了的新繁县禾登乡里，每亩水稻平均比去年增产四十五斤，该乡四十六个农业生产合作社，个个频传着丰收的喜讯。在丰收的日子里，令人永远难以忘怀的是：今年他们除得到国家大批贷款、新式农具、化学肥料援助外，远离故乡的苏联农业专家，还亲自来到他们的田间里，指导他们改进施肥和水稻培栽法；国营农场的拖拉机也前来帮助他们耕犁土地。那时候人们还不相信这些新东西，个别落后的农民，甚至还在地里放水，不让拖拉机开进田里去。可是今天他们却站在齐腰深的稻垅里，欢呼着新技术的胜利！凡用新农具、新方法耕种培栽的田，每亩都比过去多收谷五六十斤。事实教育农民认识了科学和真理。正如丰收了七十万斤稻谷的新民农业生产合作社社长史良臣说的，大家已从合作化和新农具的好处里，看到了未来的社会主义远景。
    秋收中，广大农民展开了提高谷物收获量的斗争。“天一半，地一半”，过去每亩平均要撒二十斤，今年为减少抛撒和霉烂损失，各地普遍改进收割方法。在遍地金黄的田野里，稻桩比过去割矮了，稻把放的轻了，打谷的拌桶上，加起天棚、围席和布兜了。新创造的木质改良打谷机，被男女农民摇动着，如像轻柔的波浪中的小艇似的；它不仅可使抛撒减少到最低限度，并可减少体力劳动，使妇女都可参加打谷，把收割率提高到百分之四十几。仅富顺、隆昌两县因细打细收而节约增收的稻谷即达两千多万斤。为弥补长江中、下游灾区的损失，各地一面秋收，一面积极增种一季晚秋作物。收割不久的田野里，现在已一片嫩绿了。农民们正不断施肥、除草，继续为争取再增产七亿斤粮食而努力。
    怀着无限丰收喜悦的四川农民，目前正踊跃地把粮食缴售给国家。各地仓库和粮食收购站的门口，天不亮就闹腾腾的围满了缴纳公粮和出卖余粮的农民。集体卖粮的队伍里，敲着锣鼓，飘扬起鲜艳的红旗。璧山青杠农业生产合作社为把最好的粮食卖给国家，他们远在秋收时，就把长得最饱满的稻谷挑出来，另放、另割、另打，用风车净了四次。集体送粮那天，二百多男女担的担，背的背，很快就入仓黄谷十五万斤。农民王新良说：“我们只要多夹吃一点点杂粮、番薯，就能多卖百把斤米去支援灾区！”四川人民为支援灾区，在去年和今年已经运出和即将运出的粮食即达一百二十多万吨。由无数的轮船、木船、汽车、马车组成的运输大军，正沿着长江和公路浩浩荡荡的向灾区行进。他们送去的不仅是粮食，而且还是四川六千万人民的心意！
