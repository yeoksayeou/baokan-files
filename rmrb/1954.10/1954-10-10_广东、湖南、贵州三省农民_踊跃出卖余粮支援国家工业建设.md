Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th: Farmers in Guangdong Province are enthusiastically selling their early rice to the state. By the end of September, the amount of grain sold by farmers had exceeded the state planned purchase quantity by 1.5%. Farmers are still continuing to sell. According to statistics, among the 103 counties and cities in the province with planned grain purchases, farmers in 42 counties and cities have overfulfilled their grain sales plans. Chaozhou City exceeded by 237%; Yangshan County exceeded by 119%; Xinfeng, Guangning, Luoding, Shaoguan and other counties and cities exceeded by about 50%.

This year, the planned purchase quantity of early rice in Guangdong Province is 63% more than the purchase quantity last year. Because the state has implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, carried out socialist transformation of private grain merchants, stabilized grain prices, and launched a series of political education works in rural areas, farmers are extremely enthusiastic to sell surplus grain to support national industrial construction after a bumper harvest, in addition to rapidly completing the task of paying public grain. The time for farmers to sell grain in the province is 10 days to half a month earlier than last year. Farmers in Chao'an, Jieyang, and Chaoyang counties in the East Guangdong Administrative Region basically completed their grain sales plans in less than half a month after the grain was on the market.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 9th: In order to support national industrial construction and support the people in the flood-stricken areas of Dongting Lake, the vast number of farmers in mountainous and hilly areas of Hunan Province have been timely selling large quantities of high-quality new grain to the state after the rice harvest. Hunan Province has overfulfilled the third quarter rice purchase plan, and farmers in various places are still continuing to sell.

Since the rice has been generally on the market in early September, people selling grain to various grain purchase stations have been coming in an endless stream all day long. In many areas, when the staff of the grain purchase stations opened their doors in the morning to purchase rice, they saw that the doors were already filled with baskets and carts containing rice. Chenxian Special District had overfulfilled the grain purchase plan for the third quarter in early September, and the rice sold by farmers to the state increased by 2.5 times compared with the same period last year. By mid-September, the rice sold by farmers in Hengyang and Xiangtan Special Districts had also exceeded the state's third-quarter purchase plan. Farmers in Caijia Township in Lingling County, Dashan Township in Hengnan County, and other places have sent hundreds of thousands of kilograms of rice planned to be sold to the state's grain warehouses at one time. In order to complete the state grain purchase plan on time, the farmers in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, where the harvest season is later, are harvesting on one hand and drying and winnowing the rice to sell to the state on the other hand.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 9th: Recently, farmers of all ethnic groups on the Guizhou Plateau, who have had a bumper harvest, are enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state. On the mountain roads leading to the state grain purchase stations in various places, there have appeared many collective grain selling teams, beating gongs and drums and holding red flags. There are more than 1,000 farmers in the grain selling procession of Songlin Township, Zunyi County. The Jinxing, Guangqian, and Shuangquan agricultural production cooperatives in Danzhai Miao Autonomous Region have successively sold more than 60,000 kilograms of surplus grain. The Jin Hua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chishui County increased its rice and corn production by 61% this year compared with last year. The cooperative members thought that this was the result of selling surplus grain to the state last year to invest in expanding production. Their patriotic enthusiasm is even higher, and they all regard it as their glorious task to sell all the surplus grain in the cooperative to the state to support industrial construction. The members of Qinmubao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ying'en Township, Duyun County, selected more than 23,000 kilograms of high-quality millet to sell to the state. The members of Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanke Township, Dejiang County, were very excited after hearing the news that Taiwan must be liberated. On September 19, the members sent all the surplus grain to the purchase station. They inserted a red flag into the grain baskets, writing: "Support the liberation of Taiwan, so that the compatriots in Taiwan can live a good life like us!"

    广东、湖南、贵州三省农民
    踊跃出卖余粮支援国家工业建设
     【新华社广州九日电】广东省农民踊跃地把早稻卖给国家，到九月底农民卖粮数量已突破了国家计划收购数量的百分之一点五。现在农民还在继续出售中。据统计全省一百零三个计划收购粮食的县市中，已有四十二个县市的农民超额完成卖粮计划。潮州市超额百分之二百三十七；阳山县超额百分之一百一十九；新丰、广宁、罗定、韶关等县市超额百分之五十左右。
    今年广东省早稻计划收购数量比去年收购数量多了六成三。由于国家实行了粮食统购统销，对私营粮商进行了社会主义改造，稳定了粮食价格，并在农村中展开了一系列的政治教育工作。所以农民在粮食获得丰收后，除迅速完成了缴纳公粮的任务外，出卖余粮支援国家工业建设极为踊跃。全省农民出卖粮食的时间比去年提早十天到半个月。粤东行政区的潮安、揭阳、潮阳三个县农民，在粮食上市后不到半个月，便基本上完成了售粮计划。
   【新华社长沙九日电】为支援国家工业建设和支援洞庭湖滨水灾区人民，今年湖南省山区和丘陵地区广大农民在水稻收割后，都及时地把大批品质优良的新谷卖给国家。湖南省第三季度稻谷收购计划已超额完成，现各地农民还在继续出售中。
    自九月上旬稻谷普遍登场后，到各个粮食收购站卖粮的人整天陆续不断。许多地区粮食收购站的工作人员早上开门收购稻谷时，就见门前已摆满了装着稻谷的箩筐和土车。郴县专区在九月上旬就已超额完成第三季度的粮食收购计划，农民卖给国家的稻谷比去年同期增加二点五倍。衡阳、湘潭专区到九月中旬，农民出卖的稻谷也超过了国家第三季度的收购计划。零陵县蔡家乡、衡南县大山乡等农民都将计划出售的数十万斤稻谷一次送到国家的粮食仓库。收获季节较迟的湘西苗族自治区农民为了按时完成国家粮食收购计划，农民们一面进行收割，一面就把稻谷晒干扬净卖给国家。
   【新华社贵阳九日电】近日来丰收了的贵州高原上的各族农民正踊跃地把余粮卖给国家。各地通往国家粮食收购站的山路上，出现了许多敲着锣鼓、举着红旗的集体售粮队。遵义县松林乡农民的卖粮行列有一千多人。丹寨县苗族自治区的金星、光前、双泉等三个农业生产合作社已陆续出售余粮六万多斤。赤水县金华农业生产合作社今年水稻、玉米比去年增产百分之六十一，社员们想到这是去年把余粮卖给国家投资扩大生产的结果，爱国主义热情更加高涨，都以能把社里的全部余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设为自己光荣任务。都匀县迎恩乡勤木堡农业生产合作社的社员挑选了二万三千多斤质量好的谷子卖给国家。德江县南客乡和平农业生产合作社的社员在听到一定要解放台湾的消息后都很兴奋。九月十九日，社员们就把全部余粮送到收购站，他们在粮食箩里插着一面红旗，写着：“支援解放台湾，让台湾同胞和我们一样过好生活！”
