Xinhua News Agency:

    The Chinese railway workers who are building the railway from Jining to Ulan Bator within our country are elated by the publication of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué. Along the construction line, which is over 300 kilometers long, tens of thousands of workers have expressed their determination to overcome all difficulties and ensure that the railway is opened to traffic as soon as possible. Zhang Qinghe, a model worker from the bridge engineering team, said: "I feel very honored to participate in the construction of this railway, because it will connect China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia more closely. I must do my best to complete the bridge quickly and ensure that the railway is opened to traffic as soon as possible." Just as the employees of the construction site were enthusiastically celebrating the Sino-Soviet Communiqué, a large number of steel rails were transported to the site, and the enthusiasm of the workers was further heightened. They immediately held a meeting and stated that they would increase the track-laying speed from the original 2.8 kilometers per day to 3.2 kilometers, so that the railway would reach the Sino-Mongolian border sooner. After the determination of the construction site's employees was conveyed, the employees of the transportation section, the materials factory, and the materials section also put forward guarantees related to the construction speed and signed contracts with the construction site. Now, the workers are confidently pushing the railway further north.
