National People's Congress representatives, after returning to their respective work areas, are systematically conveying the proceedings and resolutions of the First Session of the First National People's Congress to cadres and the masses. National People's Congress representatives from provinces such as Rehe, Xinjiang, and Zhejiang have all delivered reports at cadre conferences in their respective provinces. These regions, while conveying the information, emphasized the need to integrate it with the central work of their respective provinces, deeply study the documents of the National People's Congress meeting, and strengthen work in all aspects, increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to implement the various resolutions of the First Session of the National People's Congress and implement the Constitution. After hearing the transmission from National People's Congress representative Liu Changgui, the Liu Changgui team of the Chengde City Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Rehe Province formulated conditions for a challenge competition for all workers in the bureau in November and December, guaranteeing efforts to increase production and practice economy, and complete the state plan. National People's Congress representatives Li Yaoxian and Zhao Bin from Rehe Province have led members of the agricultural production cooperative they belong to in completing the harvest ahead of schedule and have begun preparations for next year's production. National People's Congress representatives in Xikang Province, based on the characteristics of their province, are conveying the information to minority ethnic leaders and people of all ethnicities. Through this communication, they continue to conduct propaganda and education on the tasks of the transitional period state in ethnic issues to all ethnic groups.

To ensure that the broad masses of people can understand the spirit and content of the various resolutions of the First Session of the National People's Congress, various regions have also organized a large number of reporters to report to the masses based on the transmission from the National People's Congress representatives and the spirit of the documents. Laiyang Special District in Shandong Province is systematically organizing reporters to convey the information to the masses. Dezhou, Huimin, and other special districts are also using propaganda tools such as blackboards and broadcasting horns to promote the message to farmers in rural areas. Based on the spirit of the National People's Congress meeting documents, the entire province is combining this with winter production, autumn grain requisition and purchase, and other work, with cooperatives and mutual aid teams as the main force, to absorb individual farmers and widely展開 learning and discussion.
