Launch a Labor Emulation Drive to Strive to Complete the State-Owned Commercial Annual Plan
Zhang Yufan, Director of the Political Department of the Ministry of Commerce

The state-owned commercial plan is an important component of the national economic plan. The success of the state-owned commercial plan is of great significance to the development of industrial and agricultural production, gradually ensuring the needs of urban and rural people's lives, increasing national tax revenue and capital accumulation, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. In order to guarantee the fulfillment and over-fulfillment of the fourth quarter plan and strive to complete the annual plan, the state-owned commercial sector must mobilize all employees to further implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy and launch a labor emulation drive.

Currently, some comrades have doubts about whether the state-owned commercial sector can implement increasing production and practicing economy and launch a labor emulation drive. They believe that the commercial sector is different from factories. State-owned commerce faces a volatile market and also bears the task of transforming private commerce. Its plan is often affected by objective reasons, and it is difficult to be as accurate as a factory's plan. In addition, there have been many shortcomings or errors in past competitions. For example, some regions have adopted competitions between commercial departments (bureaus) and between companies, resulting in difficulties in evaluation due to the different situations and natures between regions, enterprises, and between enterprises and administrative departments, affecting the morale of employees. Therefore, it is believed that it is difficult for the state-owned commercial sector to carry out business competitions.

It must be pointed out that this understanding is incorrect. Because they only see the difficult and complex side of carrying out labor emulation in the state-owned commercial sector, or only see the shortcomings or errors in the past labor emulation, but they have not seen the significant role that labor emulation has played in ensuring the completion of tasks and promoting the progress of work in recent years; they do not understand that some of the shortcomings or errors in the past competition are mainly due to the fact that the central Ministry of Commerce did not pay enough attention to the leadership of the labor emulation, did not grasp it tightly, did not provide timely guidance according to the characteristics of commercial work, and did not conduct inspections and summaries on schedule. Of course, some shortcomings or errors are unavoidable in the absence of experience.

It should be known that increasing production and practicing economy, and labor emulation are important methods for the Party and the state to lead national economic construction and are also the regular tasks of the state-owned commercial sector. As long as we put forward different specific requirements in different seasons according to the Party and the state's commercial policies, the tasks of state-owned commerce, and the characteristics of commercial work itself, explain the relevant policies and methods clearly, implement practical and specific leadership, it is entirely possible to carry out labor emulation in the state-owned commercial sector.

From the current situation, it is absolutely necessary to launch a large-scale labor emulation drive. There is a danger that this year's state-owned commercial annual plan will not be completed. In terms of the commodity circulation plan, in the first half of this year, 44 percent of the annual purchase plan and 41 percent of the sales plan were completed; entering the third quarter, the plan implementation was very poor, with purchases only completing 93.93 percent of the quarterly plan and sales only completing 88.26 percent of the quarterly plan. Even if the fourth quarter commodity circulation plan can be fully realized, the sales aspect is still a considerable number away from completing the annual plan, and the agricultural product purchase plan and the actual purchase volume may also differ by a certain amount. In terms of the financial plan, the capital turnover rate plan for January to September was 1.53 times, but in reality, it only reached 1.38 times, while the state requires that the capital turnover rate reach 2.28 times this year; the expense level is expected to decrease by about 10 percent based on the implementation situation in the first half of the year and the plan for the second half of the year, but it is still far from the rate required by the state. This shows that in order to strive to complete the annual plan, the state-owned commercial sector must implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy and launch a labor emulation drive.

There are also some comrades who have some concerns because the specific requirements for carrying out labor emulation in the state-owned commercial sector are not clear. This concern is also unfounded.

The specific requirements for the current labor emulation drive in the state-owned commercial sector are: strive to complete and over-fulfill the fourth quarter plan and strive to complete the annual plan. The state-owned commercial plan is formulated based on the responsibilities of state-owned commerce to the market, based on the policy of leading cooperative commerce to conduct business and implementing the utilization, restriction, and transformation of private commerce, as well as the requirements of national economic development; the realization of the state-owned commercial plan is consistent with the expansion of the entire social commodity circulation. Only by actively completing the state-owned commercial plan can we fully reflect the Party's commercial policy.

The fourth quarter is the season when a large amount of agricultural products are on the market. We should vigorously do a good job in the unified purchase and purchase of agricultural products in accordance with the state's policy on the unified purchase and purchase of agricultural products. According to the requirements of the national plan, cotton, oilseeds, fat pigs, tobacco leaves, as well as raw materials necessary for industry, important non-staple foods, important Chinese medicinal materials, and bulk daily necessities of handicrafts, must be fully and timely controlled by the state to supply the needs of urban and rural people's lives and industrial raw materials and ensure the completion of export tasks. Judging from the recent situation of unified cotton purchase, Jiangsu Province, one of the main cotton-producing areas in the country, only completed 20 percent of the quarterly plan as of October 13; Zhejiang Province only completed 59 percent of the monthly plan in September; this situation shows that the task of unified purchase and purchase of agricultural products will be very arduous, and we must actively work hard to strive to complete and over-fulfill the fourth quarter agricultural product purchase plan. If we cannot do this, it will have an adverse impact on the supply and market stability this year and next year.

The fourth quarter is also the main season for supplying industrial products to farmers. In order to support the purchase of agricultural products, we must strive to do a good job in expanding the supply of industrial products to the countryside. We know that vigorously organizing the supply of industrial products is precisely to expand sales. Only by correctly completing the state's sales plan can we gradually guarantee the supply of people's needs, which is conducive to the development of production and accelerate the turnover of state-owned commercial funds. However, at present, some comrades see that the supply of several kinds of commodities on the market falls short of demand, and therefore, a mentality of reluctant sales and conservatism has arisen in the sales work, which is incorrect. It should be seen that, on the one hand, for a considerable period of time, the growth rate of consumer goods production in our country cannot keep up with the growth rate of people's needs. Under this circumstance, it is inevitable that the supply of some commodities falls short of demand, and even there is a shortage. The responsibility for the temporary shortage of commodities caused by this situation does not lie with the state-owned commercial sector. However, the state-owned commercial sector must correctly complete the sales task according to the sales plan for the commodities supplied and controlled for sale according to the national plan, and it is also necessary to correct the bureaucracy in the supply work of such commodities. Some cadres in Shandong Province believe that "for the commodities supplied according to the plan, the sales task can be completed even while sleeping," and as a result, the sales plan was not completed. As of October 13, Jiangsu Province had only sold 350,000 bolts of cotton cloth, while the plan was 1.54 million bolts. The above facts show that: we must actively do the supply work of these commodities, we should strengthen the organization of the supply of goods, pay attention to the rational allocation of varieties, colors, and specifications, transport goods in a timely manner, improve service attitudes, and strive to make consumers satisfied. We must never think that we can adopt a laissez-faire attitude once planned supply is implemented. This is a completely irresponsible and erroneous attitude towards consumers, and we must oppose it.

On the other hand, the commodities that are in short supply today are still limited to several kinds of commodities, while state-owned commerce operates more than 10,000 kinds of commodities. If these commodities cannot be supplied in a timely and sufficient manner, the responsibility lies with the state-owned commercial sector. At present, there is such a situation: for example, general branches in Hebei Province have 4,000 to 5,000 kinds of commodities, but county-level stores generally only have 500 to 600 kinds of commodities, and some only have more than 200 kinds. Commodities such as bamboo shell thermos bottles, large-sized rubber shoes, sweaters, bed sheets, small general merchandise, and even batteries and matches, which are still in large quantities in secondary wholesale stations, are in short supply in many rural areas. This situation exists in varying degrees in various places, and this must be corrected quickly.

It should be recognized that after state-owned commerce replaced private wholesalers and a part of the industrial product wholesale business of the cooperative system, state-owned commerce must not only carry out the work of organizing the supply of goods for itself but also assume the responsibility of supplying goods to cooperatives and private retailers. At present, we should actively expand the sales of industrial products, especially organizing the supply of industrial products to the countryside, according to policy requirements and supply conditions. For state-owned retail companies, cooperatives, state capitalist commerce, and private peddlers, the supply of goods should be reasonably allocated, and cooperatives should be actively organized and assisted to expand sales, and the strength of private merchants should be correctly utilized to facilitate the expansion of commodity circulation. Only in this way can it conform to the requirements of the Party's commercial policy, be conducive to the expansion of urban and rural material exchange, and the completion of the state-owned commercial purchase and sales plan.

Another goal of the current labor emulation drive in the state-owned commercial sector is to strive to reduce commodity circulation costs and reduce and eliminate accidental losses on the premise of expanding commodity circulation, so as to realize the task of national capital accumulation. Now, because state-owned commerce has mastered most of the commodities, the circulation volume has been expanding year by year, and the absolute number of circulation costs has also increased. If the expense ratio can be reduced a little, it can save a lot of funds for the state. If we calculate the loss of one percent of 100 trillion yuan of commodities, we will lose 1 trillion yuan, and 1 trillion yuan is equal to 10 million city shis of grain, which is equal to the annual income of 500,000 to 800,000 farmers in poor areas. At present, our losses are quite alarming because we do not know enough about the situation of production, supply, and sales, and there are many shortcomings in management. From 1950 to 1953, the losses in property management alone amounted to 1.16 trillion yuan. Other losses caused by unreasonable transportation are also considerable. Therefore, as long as we recognize the great significance of reducing expenses, select key points, tap potential, and strive to improve operation and management, we can greatly reduce the burden on the people and increase accumulation for the country. However, reducing expenses must start from being conducive to expanding commodity circulation, and it is necessary to prevent greater losses from being caused by one-sidedly saving expenses, and at the same time, it is also necessary to prevent incorrect practices such as blindly reducing purchases, delaying purchases, and defaulting on payments.

We must mobilize urgently. On the one hand, we must do a good job in ideological mobilization among the staff and workers, strengthen the leadership of the competition, and earnestly sum up experience; on the other hand, we must see the favorable factors for completing the annual plan, and strive to complete the annual plan of state-owned commerce under the leadership of the central and all levels of Party and government.

    开展劳动竞赛，争取完成国营商业全年计划商业部政治部主任
  　张雨帆
    国营商业计划是国民经济计划的一个重要组成部分。国营商业计划执行的好坏，对于工农业生产的发展，逐步保证城乡人民生活的需要，国家税收和资金积累的增加，以及工农联盟的巩固，都有重大的意义。为了保证完成并超额完成第四季度计划，争取完成全年计划，国营商业部门必须动员全体职工，进一步贯彻增产节约精神，开展劳动竞赛。
    目前有些同志对国营商业部门能不能实行增产节约，开展劳动竞赛表示怀疑，他们认为商业部门不同于工厂，国营商业面对的是变化不定的市场，还要担负改造私营商业的任务，它的计划往往受客观原因的影响，还难以像工厂的计划一样的准确；加以过去在竞赛中还存在着不少缺点或错误，譬如某些地区曾采取商业厅（局）之间、公司和公司之间的竞赛，结果由于地区之间、企业与企业之间、企业和行政部门之间的情况不同，性质不同，评比困难，影响了职工情绪，因而认为国营商业部门难于开展业务竞赛。
    必须指出，这种认识是不对的。因为他们只看到在国营商业部门开展劳动竞赛中的困难和复杂的一面，或者只看到过去劳动竞赛中的缺点或错误的一面，却没有看到几年来开展劳动竞赛，对保证任务的完成和推动工作前进所起的重大作用；不了解过去竞赛中的某些缺点或错误，主要由于中央商业部对劳动竞赛的领导重视不够，抓的不紧，没有及时地根据商业工作的特点加以指导，并按期进行检查、总结的缘故。当然，有些缺点或错误在没有经验的情况下也是难以避免的。
    应该知道，增产节约，劳动竞赛，是党和国家领导国家经济建设的一个重要方法，也是国营商业部门的经常任务。只要我们根据党和国家的商业政策、国营商业的任务和商业工作本身的特点，在不同季节提出不同的具体要求，讲清楚有关的政策和办法，实行切实具体的领导，在国营商业部门开展劳动竞赛是完全可能的。
    从目前情况来说，完全必要开展一个大规模的劳动竞赛。今年国营商业全年计划有完不成的危险。在商品流转计划方面，今年上半年完成年度收购计划的百分之四十四，销售计划的百分之四十一；进入第三季度，计划执行的情况就很不好，收购只完成季度计划的百分之九十三点九三，销售只完成季度计划的百分之八十八点二六。就是第四季度商品流转计划能够完全实现，销售方面距全年计划的完成也还差一个相当大的数字，农产品收购计划和实际收购量也可能相差一定的数目。在财务计划方面，一月至九月份资金周转率计划是一点五三次，实际只达到一点三八次，而国家的要求今年资金周转率达到二点二八次；费用水平根据前半年执行情况及下半年计划，预计约可降低百分之十左右，但同国家要求降低的速度还相差很远。这说明，为了争取完成全年计划，国营商业部门必须贯彻增产节约精神，开展劳动竞赛。
    还有些同志由于对国营商业部门开展劳动竞赛的具体要求不明确，因而存在着一些顾虑。这种顾虑也是没有根据的。
    当前国营商业部门开展劳动竞赛的具体要求是：努力完成与超额完成第四季度计划，争取完成全年计划。国营商业计划是根据国营商业对市场所负的责任、根据领导合作社商业开展业务和贯彻对私营商业的利用、限制和改造的政策、以及国民经济发展的要求制订的；实现国营商业计划是同扩大整个社会商品流转相一致的。只有积极完成国营商业计划，才能充分体现党的商业政策。
    第四季度正是农产品大量上市的季节，我们应该根据国家关于农产品统购和收购的政策，大力作好农产品统购和收购工作。必须根据国家计划的要求，把棉花、油料、毛猪、烟叶，以及有关工业必需的原料、重要副食品、重要中药材、大宗日用必需的手工业品，充分及时地掌握到国家手里，以供应城乡人民生活需要和工业原料需要，并保证出口任务的完成。就最近棉花统购情况来看，全国棉花主要产区之一的江苏省，到十月十三日止，只完成季度计划的百分之二十；浙江省九月份只完成月计划的百分之五十九；这种情况说明了农产品统购和收购任务将是十分艰巨的，我们必须积极努力，才有可能争取完成并超额完成第四季度的农产品收购计划。如果我们不能做到这一点，对于今年与明年的供应和市场的稳定就将发生不利的影响。
    第四季度又是供应农民工业品的主要季节。为了支持农产品收购，我们必须努力作好扩大工业品下乡的工作。我们知道，大力组织工业品货源正是为了扩大推销，只有正确地完成了国家的销售计划，才能逐步保证人民需要的供应，才有利于生产事业的发展，和加速国营商业资金的周转。但目前有些同志，看到市场上若干种商品供不应求，因而在推销工作中就产生了惜售和保守情绪，这是不对的。应该看到，一方面，在相当长时期内我国消费品生产增长速度赶不上人民需要增长速度，在这种情况下，有些商品供不应求，甚至脱销，是不可避免的，由于这种情况造成的商品一时脱销，责任不在国营商业部门。但国营商业部门对于国家计划供应和掌握出售的商品，必须正确的按销售计划完成销售任务，并且要纠正对这类商品供应工作的官僚主义。山东省某些干部认为“对计划供应的商品，睡觉也能完成销售任务”，结果销售计划并未完成。江苏省棉布计划供应到十月十三日止，只卖出三十五万匹，而计划是一百五十四万匹。以上事实说明了：我们必须积极去做这类商品的供应工作，应该加强货源的组织工作，注意品种、花色、规格的合理调配，及时调运商品，改善服务态度，努力作到使消费者满意。决不能认为实行计划供应了，就可以采取放任自流的态度，这完全是对消费者不负责任的错误态度，我们必须反对。
    另一方面，今天供不应求的商品还只限于若干种商品，而国营商业经营的商品在万种以上，这些商品如不能及时充分供应，责任就在国营商业部门。目前就存在着这样的情况：如河北省一般分公司有四千种至五千种商品，但县级商店一般只有五百种至六百种商品，少的只有二百多种，像竹壳热水瓶、大号胶鞋、绒衣、床单、小百货，甚至电池、火柴等在二级批发站库存尚多的商品，在农村很多地区竟有脱销现象。这种情况在各地程度不等地存在着，这是必须迅速加以纠正的。
    应该认识，国营商业代替了私营批发商和合作社系统一部分工业品批发业务以后，国营商业不仅要为自己进行组织货源、组织供应的工作，而且还必须负起供应合作社和私营零售商货源的责任。目前就应该根据政策要求和货源情况，积极扩大工业品推销，特别是组织工业品下乡。对国营零售公司、合作社、国家资本主义商业和私商小贩，应该合理分配货源，积极组织和帮助合作社扩大推销，正确地利用私商的力量，以利扩大商品流通。只有这样做，才符合于党的商业政策的要求，有利于城乡物资交流的扩大，和国营商业购销计划的完成。
    当前国营商业部门开展劳动竞赛的另一个努力目标，就是在扩大商品流转的前提下，努力降低商品流转费，减少和消灭事故的损失，以实现国家资金积累的任务。现在，由于国营商业已掌握了绝大部分商品，流转额逐年扩大，流转费用的绝对数也随之增大，费用率若能降低一点，便可为国家节省很多资金。如果以一百万亿元的商品损耗百分之一计算，就要损失一万亿元，而一万亿元即等于一千万市石粮食，等于贫苦地区五十万到八十万农民的全年收入。目前我们由于对产、供、销的情况了解不够，经营管理上缺点很多，损失是相当惊人的。一九五○年至一九五三年仅在财产管理方面的损失，就达一万一千六百亿元。其他如因运输不合理等造成的损失为数也不少。所以，只要我们认识到降低费用的重大意义，选择重点，挖掘潜力，努力改善经营管理，就能大大减轻人民负担，又为国家增加积累。但降低费用必须从有利于扩大商品流转出发，要防止因为片面的节省费用而造成更大的损失，同时也要防止盲目少进货，晚进货，拖欠货款等不正确的作法。
    我们必须紧张地动员起来，一方面，在职工群众中作好思想动员工作，加强对竞赛的领导，认真总结经验；另方面，要看到完成全年计划的有利因素，在中央及各级党政领导下，努力完成国营商业的全年计划。
