Xinhua News Agency, London, 27th. The London dockworkers' strike has entered its fourth week, and dockworkers in six ports, including Liverpool, have also been on strike for many days. The British dockworkers who are persisting in the strike are waging a tenacious struggle against right-wing trade union bosses who are trying their best to sabotage the strike.

On the 25th, dockworkers in London, Liverpool and Southampton held mass rallies at the dock gates. The bosses of the Transport and General Workers' Union tried their best to manipulate the meetings to pass resolutions to resume work. However, the dockworkers ignored their advice and the intimidation issued again the day before by Deakin, leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union, and decided to continue the strike. On this day, another 500 dockworkers in Manchester joined the strike.

On the 24th, a mass rally was held in Hyde Park, London. Several thousand dockworkers, including London dockworkers and striking dockworkers from other ports, marched with banners through the streets of London's West End to attend the meeting. Barrett, general secretary of the National Dock Labour Board, spoke at the meeting. He said: "We will fight to the end."

The conference unanimously decided to continue the strike.

The union bosses had hoped to lure back to work those "regular workers" in the London docks who were considered the most easily swayed, so as to split the ranks of the strike. To achieve this goal, they convened a meeting of "regular workers" on the morning of the 23rd. However, the "regular workers" interrupted the speeches of the union bosses and went to attend other dockworkers' rallies.

The Churchill government held another emergency meeting on the evening of the 25th to discuss the strike issue. Although the government has repeatedly intended to send troops to the ports to sabotage the strike, it has been slow to implement this. Reuters pointed out that this is because the government fears that such action will arouse a wave of support for the strike across the country.

    英码头工人坚持罢工
    【新华社二十七日讯】伦敦消息：伦敦码头工人的罢工已经进入第四周，利物浦等六个港口的码头工人也已罢工多日。坚持罢工的英国码头工人正在和竭力破坏罢工的右翼工会头子展开顽强的斗争。
    二十五日，伦敦、利物浦和南安普顿的码头工人在码头闸门举行了群众大会。运输与普通工人工会的头子们竭力想操纵会议通过复工的决议。但是码头工人不理他们的劝告，也不理运输与普通工人工会领袖狄金在前一天晚上再度发出的恫吓，决定继续罢工。这一天，曼彻斯特又有五百名码头工人参加了罢工。
    二十四日，在伦敦海德公园举行了一个群众大会。好几千码头工人，其中有伦敦码头工人，也有其他港口的罢工码头工人，打着旗帜列队穿过伦敦西区的街道，去参加会议。全国码头工人联合会总书记巴雷特在会上讲话。他说：“我们要斗争到底”。
    大会一致决定继续罢工。
    工会头子曾经希望引诱伦敦码头工人中那些被认为最容易动摇的“长工”复工，这样来分裂罢工的队伍。为了达到这个目的，他们在二十三日早晨召集了一个“长工”的会议。但是“长工”们打断了工会头子的讲话，而去参加其他码头工人的集会。
    邱吉尔政府在二十五日晚间又一次召开紧急会议来讨论罢工问题。政府虽然屡次打算派军队倒港口去破坏罢工，但是迟迟没有实行。据路透社指出，这是因为政府害怕这种行动会在全国激起声援罢工的浪潮。
