The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace issued the following statement on October 15th in support of the Sino-Soviet talks communiqué:

During the recent visit of the Soviet government delegation to China, the Chinese and Soviet governments held talks on various issues concerning Sino-Soviet relations and the international situation and achieved satisfactory results. This is a concrete manifestation of the further unity and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples in the cause of peace, with great significance. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace expresses its complete support for the various documents issued as a result of the Sino-Soviet talks

The Joint Declaration on Sino-Soviet Relations and International Issues, the Joint Declaration on Relations with Japan, and the Joint Communiqué on the Chinese Lushunkou Naval Base, summarized the great achievements of the sincere cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples in safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world, and easing international tensions. These documents demonstrate the determination of the Chinese and Soviet peoples to further enhance the great friendship between the two countries, strengthen solidarity with people's democratic countries and all peace-loving countries, and continue to strive together to maintain peace in Asia and the world. The Sino-Soviet declaration that they are willing to establish and develop their relations with countries in the Asian and Pacific regions and other countries on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence opens up broad avenues for international cooperation. These documents are an inestimable contribution to peace and security in the Far East and the world.

The Joint Communiqué on Existing Sino-Soviet Joint-Stock Companies, the Joint Communiqué on the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, the Joint Communiqué on the Construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty Railway, the New Agreement on Soviet Loans, and the Protocol on Expanding the Scope of Soviet Equipment Supply to Chinese Enterprises, fully demonstrate the lofty internationalist concern and generous and selfless assistance of the Soviet people to our people. This will undoubtedly greatly promote our country's socialist construction, thereby further enhancing the strength of the forces headed by the Soviet Union to defend world peace.

The Sino-Soviet talks show that the friendship between our two peoples is exceptionally profound and unbreakable. The cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a reliable guarantee for safeguarding peace in the Far East and an important factor in maintaining world peace, and is indestructible by any force. The great success of this meeting is a victory for the forces of peace and democracy and a heavy blow to the American aggressors. All the aggressive conspiracies of the American aggressive bloc in Asia aimed at antagonizing the Chinese people and the Asian people will inevitably meet with a shameful and complete failure under the increasingly close unity and cooperation of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union and all peace forces in Asia and the world.　　　(Xinhua News Agency)

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会发表声明
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会为拥护中苏会谈公报，在十月十五日发表声明如下：
    最近在苏联政府代表团访问中国期间，中苏两国政府就中苏关系和国际形势的各项问题举行了会谈并获致了圆满的结果。这是中苏两国人民在和平事业中进一步团结合作的具有重大意义的具体表现。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会对中苏会谈结果所发表的各项文件表示完全的拥护。
    中苏会谈关于中苏关系和国际形势各项问题的联合宣言、关于对日本关系问题的联合宣言以及关于中国旅顺口海军根据地问题的联合公报，总结了中苏两国人民真诚合作、以维护远东及世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势的巨大成就，表明了中苏两国人民决心进一步增强中苏两国的伟大友谊，增强同人民民主国家和一切爱好和平的各国人民的团结，共同为维护亚洲及世界和平而继续奋斗。中苏两国声明，愿意在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处各项原则的基础上，建立和发展它们同亚洲及太平洋区域各国以及其他国家的关系，这就为国际合作开辟了广阔的道路。这些文件是对远东和世界和平与安全的无可估量的贡献。
    中苏会谈关于现有中苏合办股份公司问题的联合公报、关于科学技术合作协定的联合公报、关于修建兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路的联合公报，关于苏联贷款的新协定和扩大对中国企业设备供应范围的议定书，充分表现了苏联人民对我国人民崇高国际主义的关怀和慷慨无私的援助。这无疑地将大大地促进我国社会主义建设事业，从而更加增强以苏联为首的保卫世界和平的力量。
    中苏两国会谈表明我们两国人民的友谊是无比深厚和牢不可破的。中苏两国人民的合作是保卫远东和平的可靠保证和维护世界和平的重要因素，是任何力量所不可摧毁的。这次会谈的伟大成就是和平民主力量的胜利，是对美国侵略者的沉重打击。美国侵略集团在亚洲进行旨在敌视中国人民和亚洲人民的一切侵略阴谋，在中苏两大国人民和亚洲以及全世界一切和平力量日益紧密团结和合作之下，必将遭到可耻的彻底失败。　　　（新华社）
