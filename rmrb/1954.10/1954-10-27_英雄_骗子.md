    "Hero" – A Liar
    Recently, a nationally sensational comedy played out in American politics. It starkly exposed the degree to which the moral standards of American politicians have deteriorated.
    On the 16th of this month, Republican Congressman Douglas Stringfellow, in a tearful and choked voice during a television broadcast in Salt Lake City, Utah, said that the "achievements" he had boasted about in World War II were all lies. This congressman, only thirty-two years old this year, has been boasting about his wartime "achievements" for nine years. According to him, he had parachuted behind Nazi Germany with a "commando expedition." Later, the entire "expedition" was captured by the German secret police, and he was the only one who managed to escape, while all the others were "sacrificed."
    Stringfellow discovered that his "story" had a large market in the United States. For nine years, he delivered more than two hundred speeches. In the process, his "story" became more and more eloquent and vivid. He won the title of "wartime hero." Relying on this title, he was elected as a congressman.
    Not long ago, a semi-official publication, "Army Times," suddenly raised well-founded doubts about whether Stringfellow was a real "wartime hero" or just a private who had never seen combat. Stringfellow initially stubbornly insisted that this was a "political attack" and demanded that Eisenhower release "secret files" as proof. However, under the pressure of facts, the congressman, who had touted himself as a "wartime hero," finally had to admit on television that the entire "story" was fabricated. He admitted that he had not only never been arrested but had never even been behind German lines. After the lies were exposed, Stringfellow had no choice but to withdraw his candidacy for Congress.
    Of course, Stringfellow's farce is not unique in the United States. In this country, there are too many people who make political capital by lying. Stringfellow can only blame himself for having too little influence. The notorious fascist Senator McCarthy also boasted that he was a wartime air force "hero" and has been suspected more than once. However, these suspicions never came to anything, and McCarthy still retains the awards and medals given to him by the American government. Sacrificing "flies" to protect "tigers" has long been an open secret in American politics. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “英雄”——骗子
    最近，美国政坛上演出了一出轰动全国的喜剧。它突出地暴露了美国政客们的道德水平已经堕落到何等不堪的地步。
    本月十六日，共和党众议员道格拉斯·斯特林弗洛在犹他州盐湖城的一次电视广播节目中泪流满面、声音梗阻地说，他过去一直吹嘘的在第二次世界大战中的“功绩”，原来全都是撒谎。这位今年不过三十二岁的众议员，九年来到处向人吹嘘他在战时的“功绩”。据他说，他曾和一个“突击远征队”一起用降落伞在纳粹德国的后方降落。后来，这个“远征队”全部被德国秘密警察捕获，只有他一个人设法逃了出来，其余的人全部“牺牲”了。
    斯特林弗洛发现他的“故事”在美国有着广大的市场。九年来，他一共发表过二百多次演说。在这个过程中，他的“故事”说得越来越娓娓动听、神气活现了。他赢得了“战时英雄”的称号。靠了这个称号，他当选为众议员。
    不久以前，突然有一家半官方的刊物“陆军时报”对斯特林弗洛是一个真的“战时英雄”，还是一个从没有看见过战斗的上等兵，提出有根据的疑问。斯特林弗洛起初还硬着头皮说这是“政治攻击”，并且要求艾森豪威尔公布“秘密档案”以作证明。但是，在事实的逼迫下，这位自诩为“战时英雄”的众议员，终于不得不在电视广播台上承认整个“故事”都是捏造出来的。他承认，他不仅没有被捕过，而且根本没有到过德国后方。在撒谎被揭穿后，斯特林弗洛已不得不撤销他的众议员候选人资格。
    当然，斯特林弗洛的话剧在美国并不是唯一的。在这个国家里，靠撒谎来赚取政治资本的人是太多了。斯特林弗洛只能怪他自己势力太小。有名的法西斯参议员麦卡锡也曾吹嘘自己是一个战时空军“英雄”，而且也曾不止一次受到过人们的怀疑。然而，这些怀疑都没有下文，麦卡锡依旧保存着美国政府给他的奖状和勋章。牺牲“苍蝇”，正是为了保存“老虎”，这早已是美国政治中公开的秘密了。（新华社）
