    The Southeast Asia military bloc pieced together at the Manila Conference is entirely a tool for the United States to carry out aggression in Asia. One of its goals is to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements, pursue the resumption of the Indochina War, and thus create new tensions in Asia, especially threatening the peace and security of the People's Republic of China.
    The agreements reached at the Geneva Conference have achieved a ceasefire in Indochina and are having a beneficial impact on collective peace in Asia. According to the provisions of the Geneva Conference agreements and the final declaration: the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Indochina countries must be respected, and free general elections will be held within the prescribed time limit to achieve national democracy and unity; the three member states of the Indochina Federation will not participate in any military alliances, nor will they allow any foreign countries to establish military bases on their territory. Therefore, as long as the countries concerned abide by these provisions and earnestly respect the national rights of the three Indochina countries, it is possible for the Indochina countries to achieve independence, unity, and democracy, carry out national construction in a peaceful environment, and thus expand the area of peace in Asia and the world. The Geneva Conference agreements fully conform to the wishes and interests of the people of Indochina and are welcomed and supported by all honest people.
    However, the US aggression bloc has taken a completely opposite attitude towards the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. As everyone knows, even before the Geneva Conference was convened, the United States put forward a so-called "united action" plan, attempting to expand the Indochina War. During the conference, the United States exhausted all kinds of threats and blackmail to obstruct the agreement on the Indochina issue. When an agreement was reached on the Indochina issue, although US representative Smith guaranteed not to undermine the Indochina armistice agreement by force, on the same day that the Indochina armistice agreement was signed—July 21—US Secretary of State Dulles, while testifying before the US Senate Appropriations Committee, had already indicated that he would drag Laos, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam into the planned Southeast Asia aggression bloc.
    The United States' sinister attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords was further exposed at the Manila Conference. The so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty Protocol" adopted by the Manila Conference stipulates that Laos, Cambodia, and so-called "Free Vietnam" are designated as countries and territories to which Article 3 and Article 4 of the "Southeast Asia Treaty" apply. This means that the Southeast Asia military alliance countries have unilaterally included the three federal member states of Indochina into the scope of their military bloc, assumed military obligations to these three countries, and are to take so-called "economic measures" against them. Obviously, this is an act of undermining the Geneva Conference agreements, because this approach actually forces the three federal member states of Indochina to accept the domination and constraints of the Southeast Asia military alliance.
    In the draft of the Southeast Asia aggression bloc treaty drawn up by the United States, the clause including the three federal member states of Indochina in this military bloc was written into the text of the treaty. Although the Manila Conference did not include this clause in the text of the treaty, but instead came up with a separate protocol, this cannot conceal the essence of its blatant violation of the Geneva Conference agreements. Indian Ambassador to the United Nations Menon justly pointed out: "Under the terms of the Geneva Accords, it is impossible for an Indochina federation member to have relations with the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization - whether directly or indirectly - without violating the agreement." U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson also openly admitted in a speech on September 18 that the purpose of the Manila "Convention" planned by the United States was to "minimize" the role of the Geneva Conference agreements.
    What exactly is the US aggression bloc seeking with such reckless actions? People only need to pay attention to the provisions of Article 4 of the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" to understand. This article stipulates the military and war obligations that the contracting countries of this treaty must undertake, and these obligations apply to the three federal member states of Indochina. These obligations are: the contracting countries must not only "deal with" any "armed attack" against any contracting country and the countries and territories designated by them, but also "immediately consult" on "measures that should be taken" in response to anything that any contracting country considers to be "a threat in any way other than armed attack" and "the impact or threat of any fact or situation that may endanger the peace of the region". Obviously, this means that the United States can create any excuse at any time to provoke new wars in Indochina and other regions, and to plunge this region back into the flames of war. The US government has previously made various excuses to interfere in the national liberation struggle of the people of Indochina. After the realization of the armistice in Indochina, the US ruling group is still unwilling to give up, and attempts to use the Southeast Asia aggression bloc it pieced together to undermine peace in Indochina. Isn't this sinister intention very obvious?
    The Manila Conference protocol also stipulates that so-called "economic measures" should be taken against the federal member states of Indochina. US officials are also constantly publicizing the need to sign bilateral agreements with Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai Vietnam to implement large-scale "military aid" and "economic plans." People are not unfamiliar with things like "economic measures" and "aid" promoted by the United States. This so-called "economic measure" and "aid" is actually a plunder of the strategic raw materials of backward countries. The US "Point Four Program" and "economic aid" implemented in Asia in the past have already proved this point. Moreover, US government officials and the US propaganda machine have long made no secret of the importance of the rich strategic raw materials in Southeast Asia, including Indochina, and have repeatedly emphasized that the United States must obtain these strategic raw materials. Therefore, the nonsense in the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" that implementing "economic measures" is for "promoting economic progress and social welfare" cannot fool people. And this kind of "economic measure" aimed at plundering the strategic raw materials of Indochina is consistent with the US's goal of military aggression in Indochina, and is also something that anyone who cares about international affairs can see.
    The United States and other countries in the Southeast Asia military bloc, in blatant violation of the Geneva Conference agreements, include the three federal member states of Indochina within the scope of their military alliance, which seriously threatens peace and security in Indochina and the whole of Asia. Fair opinion in various countries unanimously condemns the hegemonic practice of the Southeast Asia aggression bloc countries. The Indian "Express" and "Hindustan Times" said that Dulles' demand to give Laos, Cambodia and Bao Dai Vietnam "some protection" is a destruction of the Indochina agreement. The "Indonesian Torch Daily" also pointed out: The protocol attached to the "Southeast Asia Treaty" is specifically to undermine the agreement of the Geneva Conference. The protocol contains the intention to dispatch troops to Indochina.
    The condemnation of fair opinion in various countries cannot be ignored; the United States and its followers in the Southeast Asia aggression bloc must be held responsible for this illegal act they have committed. In particular, those countries participating in the Manila Conference that have assumed solemn obligations to the agreements of the Geneva Conference cannot escape the responsibility for the serious consequences caused in Indochina by their illegal acts.
    The peace, independence, unity, and democracy of the Indochina countries are the goals of the Indochina people's years of struggle, and are also important factors in maintaining peace and security in Asia. The people of Indochina and the people of Asian countries will never allow the United States and its followers to undermine the agreements of the Geneva Conference, and must resolutely fight to the end to uphold the agreements of the Geneva Conference and defeat the US aggression conspiracy.

    东南亚侵略集团是美国破坏日内瓦协议的工具
  　施迟
    马尼拉会议拼凑的东南亚军事集团，彻头彻尾是美国对亚洲进行侵略的工具。它的目的之一，就是要破坏日内瓦会议的协议，追求印度支那战争的再起，以便在亚洲制造新的紧张局势，特别是威胁中华人民共和国的和平和安全。
    日内瓦会议达成的协议，已使印度支那实现了停战，并对亚洲的集体和平发生着有利的影响。根据日内瓦会议的协议和最后宣言的规定：印度支那国家的独立、主权、统一和领土完整必须得到尊重，并将按照规定的期限举行自由普选以实现国家的民主和统一；印度支那三个联邦成员国家将不参加任何军事同盟，也不容许任何外国在它们领土建立军事基地。因此，只要有关国家信守这些规定，切实尊重印度支那三国的民族权利，印度支那国家就有可能获得独立、统一、民主，在和平环境中进行国家建设，从而扩大亚洲和世界的和平地区。日内瓦会议的协议完全符合印度支那人民的愿望和利益，并受到一切正直的人们的欢迎和支持。
    但是美国侵略集团对于恢复印度支那和平问题却采取了完全相反的态度。大家知道，早在日内瓦会议召开之前，美国就曾提出所谓“联合行动”计划，企图扩大印度支那战争。在会议期间，美国又曾用尽种种威胁和讹诈的手段，来阻挠印度支那问题的协议。在印度支那问题达成协议的时候，美国代表史密斯虽然保证不以武力破坏印度支那停战协定，但就在印度支那停战协定签字的同一天——七月二十一日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在美国参议院拨款委员会上作证时，就已经表示要把老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部拖进正在策划中的东南亚侵略集团了。
    美国破坏日内瓦协议的罪恶企图，在马尼拉会议上进一步暴露出来了。马尼拉会议通过的所谓“东南亚条约议定书”规定，老挝、柬埔寨和所谓
  “自由越南”被指定为适用“东南亚条约”第三条和第四条的国家和领土。这就是说东南亚军事联盟国家已片面地把印度支那三个联邦成员国家列入了它们的军事集团的范围之内，对这三个国家承担了军事义务，并要对它们采取所谓“经济措施”。显然，这是破坏日内瓦会议的协议的行为。因为这种做法实际上是强使印度支那三个联邦成员国家接受东南亚军事联盟的支配和束缚。
    在美国拟订的东南亚侵略集团条约的草案中，曾把印度支那三个联邦成员国家列入这个军事集团的条文写在条约的本文之内。虽然马尼拉会议的结果没有把这个条款列入条约本文，而是另外搞出一个议定书来，但这绝不能掩盖它公然违反日内瓦会议的协议的实质。印度驻联合国代表梅农就曾公正地指出：“根据日内瓦协定的条款，印度支那联邦成员国不可能与东南亚公约组织发生关系——不论是直接的还是间接的——而不致违反这个协定。”美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊在九月十八日的演说中也公开承认：美国一手策划的马尼拉“公约”的目的是要把日内瓦会议的协议的作用“缩小到最低限度。”
    美国侵略集团这样不顾一切的做法，其执意追求的究竟是什么呢？人们只要注意到所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”第四条的规定，就可以了然了。这一条规定了这个条约的缔约国家所必须承担的军事的和战争的义务，并且所承担的这些义务又都适用于印度支那三个联邦成员国家。这些义务是：各缔约国家不但对于任何缔约国家和它们所指定的国家和领土的“武装进攻”要加以“对付”，而且对于只要任何缔约国家认为属于“武装进攻以外的任何方式的威胁”以及“可能危及本区域的和平的任何事实和情势的影响或威胁”的东西，都要“立即磋商”“应当采取的措施”。很显然，这就是说美国可以随时制造随便什么借口，来在印度支那和其他地区挑起新的战争，来使这个地区重新陷入战火之中。美国政府对于印度支那人民的民族解放斗争过去曾制造种种借口进行干涉，在印度支那停战实现之后美国统治集团仍然不肯罢休，而企图利用它所拼凑的东南亚侵略集团来破坏印度支那的和平。这种险恶的用心难道不是十分明显的吗？
    马尼拉会议的议定书还规定要对印度支那联邦成员国家采取所谓“经济措施”。美国的官员们也在不断的宣传要和老挝、柬埔寨以及保大越南订立双边协定，实行大规模的“军事援助”和“经济计划”。对于美国所宣扬的“经济措施”和“援助”之类的东西，人们是并不生疏的。这种所谓“经济措施”和“援助”实际上就是对落后国家的战略原料的掠夺。美国过去对亚洲实行的“第四点计划”和“经济援助”早已证明了这一点。并且，美国政府官员和美国的宣传机器早就毫不讳言东南亚包括印度支那的丰富的战略原料的重要性，并且一再强调美国必须得到这些战略原料。因此，“东南亚集体防务条约”中所说的实施“经济措施”是为了“促进经济进步和社会福利”这种鬼话是骗不了人的。而这种以掠夺印度支那的战略原料为目的的“经济措施”又是和美国在印度支那追求的军事侵略的目的相一致，也是任何关心国际事务的人都能够看得出的。
    美国及东南亚军事集团的其他国家，悍然违反日内瓦会议的协议，而将印度支那三个联邦成员国划入它们的军事联盟的范围之内，这严重地威胁着印度支那以及全亚洲的和平和安全。各国公正舆论一致谴责东南亚侵略集团国家的这种横蛮做法。印度“快报”和“印度斯坦时报”说，杜勒斯的关于给老挝、柬埔寨和保大越南以“某种保护”的要求，是对印度支那协定的破坏。“印度尼西亚火炬报”也指出：附在“东南亚条约”后面的议定书，就是特别为了破坏日内瓦会议的协定。议定书包含有派遣军队到印度支那的意图。
    各国公正舆论的谴责是不容忽视的；美国及其在东南亚侵略集团中的追随者必须对它们所干下的这种非法行为担负责任。尤其是马尼拉会议与会国家中那些对日内瓦会议的协议承担了庄严的义务的国家，更不能逃避由于它们的非法行为而在印度支那引起严重的后果的责任。
    印度支那国家的和平、独立、统一、民主，是印度支那人民多年奋斗的目标，同时也是维护亚洲和平和安全的重要因素。印度支那人民和亚洲各国人民绝不容许美国及其追随者破坏日内瓦会议的协
  议，一定要为维护日内瓦会议协议，击败美国的侵略阴谋而坚决斗争到底。
