    印度报纸对中印贸易协定的签订表示欢迎
    【新华社新德里十八日电】印度报纸继续发表社论欢迎中印贸易协定的签订，并认为这两个国家建立在互利基础上的贸易关系将有广阔的发展前途。
      “印度教徒报”十六日的社论说，中印贸易协定巩固着早已由中印两国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定以及中印两国总理的联合声明所建立起来的两国的友谊和亲善。社论说：“和去年的苏印贸易协定一样，同中国签订的协定提供了建立大量的互利贸易的基础。”社论并说：“在尼赫鲁先生动身前往中国前夕，在新德里签订中印贸易协定是这次访问的一个吉兆，这个访问可能证明在醒觉过来的亚洲的史册上是有历史意义的。”
    “论坛报”十六日说：中印贸易协定的缔结“再一次证明双方是具有为共同的幸福而努力合作的愿望的”。
      “印度斯坦时报”、“国民先驱报”和其他印度报纸也都在关于中印贸易协定的社论中评述中印贸易发展的可能性。
