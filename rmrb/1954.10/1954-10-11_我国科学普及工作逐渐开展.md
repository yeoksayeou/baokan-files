    Scientific popularization work in our country is gradually developing extensively. Currently, thirty provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and ninety-seven counties and province-administered cities have established science and technology popularization associations and groups. As of June this year, there are 30,550 members nationwide. In the past four years, they have carried out a large amount of science and technology popularization work among the people.
    In order to cooperate with the country's socialist industrialization, science and technology popularization associations in various places have cooperated with trade unions to hold a large number of lectures in factories and mines for transferred cadres and cadres newly promoted from workers, helping them to master new skills. The associations have also provided assistance to technical workers in modifying new products, learning new Soviet technologies, and improving their scientific and technological level. In the first quarter of this year, science and technology popularization associations in sixteen cities and provinces, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, and Zhejiang, held many lectures for workers and industrial cadres on topics such as motor and mechanical knowledge. Some associations also held lectures on basic sciences such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics, which were very popular among workers. Some workers called these lectures "social universities." Science and technology popularization associations in more than a dozen large cities, including Beijing, also held lectures on "basic construction scientific knowledge."
    Science and technology popularization associations in various places have done a lot of work for government cadres. For example, to cooperate with cadres in various agencies in studying the country's general task during the transition period, fifty lectures on "Socialist Industrialization" and "Economic Construction" were held across the country this year. Such scientific lectures were not only held in provincial capitals but also in medium-sized county towns. For example, the lecture on "China's Industrialization Geographical Conditions" was given thirty times in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, with more than 11,000 listeners, and almost every government cadre in the city heard the lecture.
    In addition, science knowledge popularization work was also carried out for teachers, junior medical personnel, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, nursery workers, and children. The Beijing Science and Technology Popularization Association held a year-long lecture on industrial hygiene knowledge for junior medical personnel and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the Mentougou mining area in the suburbs. The lectures were held twice a month, and some listeners had to travel dozens of miles and cross several high mountains to attend. After returning, they still had to give relay reports, but they were able to persist in attending the lectures for a long time.
    Science and technology popularization associations in various places have also mobilized scientific workers in the fields of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and medicine in cities to compile various written publicity materials on agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry technology and hygiene knowledge. They also held small-scale picture and model exhibitions and sent them to the countryside for publicity through party committees, cultural centers, and rural technology stations, which were very popular among farmers. The mass touring exhibition organized by the Hebei Science and Technology Popularization Association was toured by cultural centers in various counties. In more than two years, it traveled to all counties in the province, not only popularizing scientific knowledge but also promoting local production.
    Science and technology workers in various places are engaged in science and technology popularization work with great enthusiasm. In 1953, the Shanghai Science and Technology Popularization Association had 1,800 members who conducted 6,490 scientific broadcasts and lectures. The Jiangxi Science and Technology Popularization Association's member working group in a machine factory had only fifteen members, and they gave 192 scientific lectures to workers in a year. In the process of carrying out science popularization work, members also created many methods. For example, Zhao Xuetian, a member of the Wuhan Science and Technology Popularization Association and a professor at Huazhong Institute of Technology, created the "Speed Reading Blueprint Method" when teaching workers "How to Read Blueprints." Using this blueprint reading method, ordinary workers who did not understand blueprints could learn to read mechanical parts drawings and even simple machine assembly drawings after only five lectures and discussion exercises, totaling only twenty hours.

    我国科学普及工作逐渐开展
    我国科学技术普及工作逐渐广泛开展起来。现在全国已有三十个省和直辖市、九十七个县和省辖市建立了科学技术普及协会和小组。到今年六月份止，全国会员已有三万零五百五十人。四年中他们向人民群众进行了大量的科学技术普及工作。
    为了配合国家的社会主义工业化事业，各地科学技术普及协会和工会合作，在厂矿企业中为转业干部和新由工人提升的干部办了大量的讲座，帮助他们掌握新的业务。对技术工人改制新产品，学习苏联的新技术，提高科学技术水平，协会也进行了帮助。今年第一季度，北京、上海、河北、浙江等十六个城市和省份的科学技术普及协会为工人和工业干部举办了许多以电机、机械知识为主题的讲座，有的协会还举办了关于物理、化学和数学等基础科学的讲座，很受工人欢迎，有的工人把这些讲座叫做“社会大学”。北京等十几个大城市的科学技术普及协会还举办了“基本建设科学知识”讲座。
    各地科学技术普及协会为机关干部做了很多工作。例如配合各机关干部学习国家在过渡时期的总任务，今年在全国各地举办了五十个“社会主义工业化”和“经济建设”讲座。这样的科学讲演，不但在省城里举行，在中等县城里也举行。如“中国工业化地理条件”讲座在浙江省宁波市就讲了三十次，听众达一万一千多人，几乎全市每个机关干部都听到了讲演。
    此外，对教员、初级医务人员、中医、保育员和少年儿童也进行了科学知识普及工作。北京市科学技术普及协会在郊区门头沟矿区为全矿区的初级医务人员和中医举办了一个为期一年的工业卫生知识讲座，每月举行两次，有些听众来听讲要走几十里路，要翻几座高山，回去以后还要做传达报告，但仍能长期坚持听讲。
    各地科学技术普及协会还动员城市中的农业、林业、畜牧业和医务界的科学工作者编制了关于农林和畜牧的技术与卫生知识的各种文字宣传资料，并举办了小型的图片和模型展览，通过党委、文化馆站、农村技术站等机构，送下乡去宣传，受到农民很大的欢迎。河北省科学技术普及协会组织的大众巡回展览，由各县文化馆巡回展出，在两年多时间里，走遍了全省所有各县，不但普及了科学知识，还推动了当地的生产。
    各地的科学技术工作者都以高度热情从事科学技术普及工作。上海市科学技术普及协会在一九五三年有一千八百个会员进行了六千四百九十次科学广播和讲演。江西省科学技术普及协会一个机器厂的会员工作组，只有十五个会员，他们一年内为工人作了一百九十二次科学讲演。在进行科学普及工作过程中，会员们还创造了很多方法，如武汉市科学技术普及协会会员、华中工学院教授赵学田在对工人讲授“如何看蓝图”时，创造了“速成看图法”，用这种看图法，只要经过五次的讲演和讨论练习，一共只要花二十个小时就可使不懂蓝图的普通工人看机械零件图以至简单的机器装配图。
