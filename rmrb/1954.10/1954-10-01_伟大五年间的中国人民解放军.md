During the great five years from the founding of the People's Republic of China to the convocation of the First National People's Congress, the Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, laid the foundation for national unity, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, completed various social democratic reforms, carried out socialist economic construction on the basis of healing war wounds and restoring industrial and agricultural production, launched a vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and actively participated in the international peace movement through their heroic struggle and selfless labor, thereby crushing the U.S. aggressive bloc's conspiracy of armed intervention against China on the two fronts of Korea and Indochina, and enhancing the country's international status. Now, the people of the whole country are advancing with full confidence towards the great goal of building a socialist society.

In these great five years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, adapted to the requirements of the development of the revolutionary situation and faithfully fulfilled its glorious task of being both a fighting force and a working force. With the warm support and cooperation of the people of the whole country, it victoriously carried out the operation of liberating the entire mainland and suppressing special agents and bandits, actively participated in the construction work during the period of social democratic reform and economic recovery, and achieved great achievements in its own modernization of military construction, thereby preparing the conditions for liberating Taiwan and thoroughly completing the cause of liberation and unification of the motherland.

When the People's Republic of China was founded, the remnant troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang were still entrenched in the vast areas of southern and southwestern China, stubbornly resisting. The armies of the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossing the river, with the love and support of the people of the whole country, annihilated the remnant troops of Chiang Kai-shek on the mainland with overwhelming force in a short period of seven months. They successively launched the Xiangzhong Hengyang Baoqing Campaign, the Yuezhong Yangjiang Campaign, the Yuegui Border Campaign, the Qianchuan Campaign, the Chuandong Campaign, and the Chuanxi Campaign, eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army that dared to resist stubbornly, and winning over some Kuomintang troops to revolt and surrender, thereby completely ending the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group on the mainland. Subsequently, the Hainan Island Campaign and the Zhoushan Campaign were launched, making Hainan Island, the southern barrier of our country, and the Zhoushan Islands, a rich fishing area, return to the embrace of the people's motherland.

In the summer of 1951, in order to implement the agreement signed by the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government on the methods for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Chinese People's Liberation Army trekked through mountains and rivers from Sichuan and Xinjiang, peacefully entered Tibet, thereby completing the unprecedented situation of the complete unification of the Chinese mainland.

In the two and a half years up to the late spring of 1952, the Chinese People's Liberation Army also carried out large-scale bandit suppression operations in the areas where the Chiang bandit army had collapsed and where bandit reactionary armed forces were entrenched. Our army adopted the policy of combining military suppression, political disintegration, and mobilizing the masses, and with the active assistance of the people, successively quelled the bandit special agent armed forces in various places, enabling the people's China to have a social order of stability that had never been seen in history, and providing preconditions for mobilizing the masses in various places to carry out the land reform movement and restore industrial and agricultural production.

In order to protect the safety of the motherland and the peaceful labor of the people, the naval defense, border defense, and air defense troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army vigilantly guarded the sacred territory, territorial waters, and airspace of the motherland day and night. They often endured all the hardships in the sparsely populated border areas and coasts, regardless of wind, rain, or sunshine, closely monitoring the enemy, and giving severe blows to the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit troops, planes, ships, and special agents who harassed them from time to time.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is not only a heroic fighting force that makes the enemy tremble with fear, but also a huge working force that the people trust infinitely. With the victorious advance of the Liberation War, our army entered the newly liberated areas, assisted the local party organizations and local governments of the Communist Party of China in establishing people's political power and people's organizations at all levels, mobilized and united the people of all ethnic groups, carried out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, rent reduction and interest reduction, and the great land reform movement in the vast areas, organized the urban and rural people to restore industrial and agricultural production, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and became a faithful and powerful assistant to the Party in carrying out mass work. In areas where disasters and epidemics occurred, our army actively assisted the people's government in rescuing the wounded and healing the sick, overcoming disasters, and helping the people restore production with a high degree of self-sacrifice.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army also directly participated in the restoration and construction work of the motherland. After the complete liberation of the mainland, some troops were collectively transferred to form a huge army for railways, highways, water conservancy, petroleum, agriculture and other projects and production, and went to the front line of economic construction. With selfless spirit, solid discipline, and collective wisdom, they engaged in creative labor, skillfully and quickly mastered technology, and maintained a fairly high level of labor efficiency. From labor production, they not only enhanced their love for the motherland, but also gained the necessary specialized skills to engage in social labor and participate in socialist economic construction, adding fresh troops to the production front of the motherland.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army concentratedly embodies the noble qualities of the Chinese people's heroism, tenacity, diligence, and simplicity, as well as the heroic spirit of overcoming all difficulties and defeating the enemy. It loves the people and inspires the people with its fine traditions; the people also love it and support it with everything they have. Under the shining light of the Party's correct line and policies, the iron-like close unity of the army and the people has become a huge force for promoting and completing the cause of revolution and construction.

From the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has kept in mind the instructions of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong: "The People's Liberation Army will always be a fighting force," "We will not only have a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy," and in order to realize these instructions, carried out a series of ideological and organizational work. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has firmly established the idea of learning from the advanced Soviet military science and building itself into an excellent modern revolutionary army in order to liberate Taiwan, defend against imperialist aggression, protect the security of the motherland, and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

In the past five years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has gradually established various special arms and air force and navy on the basis of the original infantry; changed the backward equipment into more modern equipment; improved the cultural level of the troops so that they can master modern technical weapons and equipment; established regular military schools of various arms and levels, providing a source of officer replenishment for the modernization construction of our army; established a unified national military leadership organ, thereby unifying military training, unifying various standards and systems, and promulgating unified regulations. The results of these works have enabled the Chinese People's Liberation Army to gradually complete the great historical transformation from a low-level stage to a high-level stage. Now we already have not only a strong army and various special arms, but also a fairly basic air force and navy.

It should be particularly mentioned that the brilliant contribution of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has great significance for the modernization construction of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. When the U.S. aggressive bloc invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, invaded our Taiwan, and threatened our security, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people organized the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and fought side by side with the heroic Korean People's Army. In the two years and nine months of heroic and arduous battles, they severely attacked the U.S. aggressor army and its accomplice armies, achieved brilliant victories, and finally forced the enemy to accept the proposal for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and signed the armistice agreement. The valuable combat experience of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in defeating the U.S. aggressor army equipped with modern equipment is part of the precious property of the Chinese people's armed forces, and will have an extremely important impact on improving the military combat art level of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

It should also be particularly mentioned that the great and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country's industrial construction has accelerated the speed of our country's industrialization; and the country's socialist industrialization enables us to have a sufficiently strong modern national defense to defend against any armed aggression by imperialism.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army cannot ignore the fact that the U.S. aggressive bloc has always been hostile to the People's Republic of China. It has continuously attempted to carry out armed intervention and war threats against China from the three fronts of Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina. Although the armistice in Korea and the restoration of peace in Indochina have gradually eased the tense situation in Asia; however, the U.S. aggressive bloc is not reconciled to its failure. On the contrary, in order to create new tensions, it is stepping up its use of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group fleeing to Taiwan to carry out harassing and destructive wars against our mainland and coastal areas, planning to sign the so-called U.S.-Chiang "Joint Security Bilateral Treaty," and not long ago, coerced its puppet countries to sign the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" that is hostile to the Chinese and Asian people. Therefore, the Chinese People's Liberation Army must soberly understand the glorious task entrusted to it by the Chinese people, which is to liberate the territory of the motherland, Taiwan, defend against U.S. imperialist aggression, protect the peaceful labor and socialist construction of the people of the motherland, and safeguard peace in Asia and the world. The joint declaration of all democratic parties and people's organizations for the liberation of Taiwan solemnly declared the will of the Chinese people, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army must strive to the end to realize the entrustment of the people! We must train ourselves to be even stronger and invincible in the battle to liberate Taiwan!

We should sternly warn those war provocateurs who are hostile to the Chinese people: the Chinese people who have stood up will never allow any imperialism to invade the sacred territory of China, and no blackmail policy can scare us. The history of the great Chinese people's revolution has once again confirmed our unbreakable belief: the power of the awakened people is invincible.

    伟大五年间的中国人民解放军
    聂荣臻
    从中华人民共和国成立，到第一届全国人民代表大会会议的召开，中国人民经历了伟大的五年。在这伟大的五年中，中国人民在伟大的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，用自己的英勇斗争和忘我劳动，奠定了全国统一的局面，巩固了人民民主专政，完成了各种社会民主改革，在医治战争创伤恢复工农业生产的基础上进行了社会主义的经济建设，掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，并积极参加了国际和平运动，从而粉碎了美国侵略集团在朝鲜和印度支那两个战线上对中国武装干涉的阴谋，提高了祖国的国际地位。现在全国人民正满怀信心，向着建设社会主义社会的伟大目标继续前进。
    在这伟大的五年中，中国人民解放军按照中国共产党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，适应革命形势发展的要求，忠诚地执行了自己既是一支战斗队、又是一支工作队的光荣任务。它在全国人民的热烈支援和配合下，胜利地进行了解放全部大陆和剿灭特务土匪的作战，积极地参与了社会民主改革和经济恢复时期的建设工作，并在本身的现代化军事建设上获得了巨大的成就，从而为解放台湾、彻底完成祖国的解放和统一事业准备了条件。
    当中华人民共和国成立的时候，蒋介石匪帮的残余军队，还盘踞着我国南部、西南部的广大地区，负隅顽抗。中国人民解放军渡江作战的各路大军，在全国人民的热爱和支援下，以排山倒海的力量，在短短的七个月的时间，歼灭了大陆上的蒋贼残余军队，先后举行了湘中衡阳宝庆战役、粤中阳江战役、粤桂边战役、黔川战役、川东战役、川西战役，扫灭了敢于顽抗的蒋介石匪军，争取了部分国民党军队的起义、投诚，从而全部结束了蒋介石卖国集团在大陆上的反动统治。随后，又举行了海南岛战役和舟山战役，使我国南面屏障的海南岛和丰富鱼产区舟山群岛回到人民祖国的怀抱。
    一九五一年夏季，中国人民解放军为执行中央人民政府和西藏地方政府签订的关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，从四川和新疆跋涉万水千山，和平进驻西藏，从而完成了史无前例的中国大陆全部统一的局面。
    截至一九五二年春末的两年半的时间中，中国人民解放军在蒋匪军的溃散地区和土匪反动武装盘踞的地区，还进行了巨大规模的剿匪作战。我军采取了军事进剿、政治瓦解和发动群众相结合的方针，在人民群众的积极协助下，相继敉平了各地的土匪特务武装，使人民中国有了历史上从未有过的社会安定秩序，并为各地发动群众进行土地改革运动、恢复工农业生产提供了前提条件。
    为了保卫祖国的安全和人民的和平劳动，中国人民解放军的海防、边防、空防部队，日日夜夜警惕地守卫着祖国神圣的领土、领海、领空，他们常常在人烟稀少的边疆和沿海，不论风雨晴晦，忍受着一切辛劳艰苦，严密地监视着敌人，并给予不时窜扰的蒋介石残余匪军、飞机、舰艇、特务以严重的打击。
    中国人民解放军不仅是使敌人望风丧胆的英勇战斗队，并且是人民无限信赖的巨大工作队。随着解放战争的胜利进军，我军进入新的解放地区，协助了中共地方党组织和地方政府建立了各级人民政权和人民团体，发动并团结了各族人民，在广大地区开展了镇压反革命、减租减息和伟大的土地改革等运动，组织城乡人民群众恢复了工农业生产，巩固了人民民主专政，成为党在进行群众工作中的忠实而有力的助手。在发生灾害和疫病的地区，我军以高度的自我牺牲精神，积极地协助人民政府救死扶伤，战胜灾害，并帮助人民恢复生产。
    中国人民解放军还直接参加了祖国的恢复和建设工作。在大陆全部解放之后，实行了部分部队集体转业，组成了巨大的铁路、公路、水利、石油、农业等工程和生产大军，开赴经济建设的前线。他们以忘我的精神、巩固的纪律和集体的智慧，从事着创造性的劳动，他们巧妙而迅速地掌握了技术，使劳动效率保持相当高的水平。从劳动生产中，他们不仅增强了对祖国的热爱，并且使他们获得从事社会劳动参加社会主义经济建设的必要的专门技术，为祖国生产战线上增加了生力军。
    中国人民解放军集中体现了中国人民英勇顽强、勤劳朴素的高贵品质和排除万难、战胜敌人的英雄气概。它热爱人民，并以自己的优良传统鼓舞人民；人民也热爱它，并以自己的一切来支持它。在党的正确的路线、政策的光辉照耀下，军民钢铁
  一般的亲密团结，就成为推动和完成革命和建设事业的巨大力量。
    中国人民解放军从中华人民共和国成立之日起，就牢记着党和毛泽东同志的指示：“人民解放军永远是一支战斗队”，“我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军”，并为实现这些指示，进行了一系列的思想工作和组织工作。中国人民解放军牢固地树立了学习苏联先进军事科学，将自己建设成为一支优良的现代化革命军队，以解放台湾、防御帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国安全，保卫亚洲和世界和平。
    五年以来，中国人民解放军已逐步地在原有步兵的基础上，建立了各特种兵部队和空军、海军；将落后的装备改变为较现代化的装备；提高了部队的文化水平，使它们能够掌握现代的技术兵器和装备；建立了各兵种各级的正规军事学校，为我军现代化建设提供了军官补充的源泉；建立了国家统一的军事领导机关，从而统一了军事训练，统一了各种制式和制度，颁布了统一的条令。这些工作的结果，使中国人民解放军逐步完成着由低级阶段到高级阶段的伟大历史转变。现在我们已经不仅有了一个强大的陆军和各特种兵部队，而且已经有了一个相当基础的空军和海军了。
    应当特别提到，中国人民志愿军的辉煌贡献，对于中国人民解放军的现代化的建设，有着重大的意义。当美国侵略集团侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、侵略我国台湾、威胁我国安全的时候，中国人民的优秀儿女，组织了中国人民志愿军，同英雄的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，在两年零九个月的英勇而艰巨的战斗中，严重地打击了美国侵略军及其帮凶军，取得了光辉的胜利，终于迫使敌人不得不接受和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，签订了停战协定。中国人民志愿军击败现代化装备的美国侵略军的宝贵作战经验，是中国人民武装的珍贵财产的一部分，对于提高中国人民解放军的军事斗争艺术水平，将发生极重要的影响。
    还应当特别提到，苏联对于我国工业建设的伟大无私的援助，使我国工业化建设的速度加快了；而国家的社会主义工业化，就使我们能够有足够强大的现代化国防，来防御任何帝国主义的武装侵略。
    中国人民解放军不能无视这样的事实：美国侵略集团一向敌视中华人民共和国，它曾经不断企图从台湾、朝鲜、印度支那三个战线上进行对中国的武装干涉和战争威胁。虽然朝鲜的停战和印度支那和平的恢复，使亚洲的紧张局势逐步趋于和缓；但美国侵略集团并不甘心于自己的失败，相反，为了制造新的紧张局势，它正在加紧利用逃在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团，对我国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，策划签订所谓美蒋“共同安全双边条约”，并在不久以前，胁迫其仆从国家签订了敌视中国和亚洲人民的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”。因此，中国人民解放军必须清醒地懂得中国人民所付托给自己的光荣任务，那就是解放祖国的领土台湾，防御美帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国人民的和平劳动和社会主义建设，保卫亚洲和世界和平。各民主党派各人民团体为解放台湾的联合宣言，庄严地宣布了中国人民的意志，中国人民解放军一定要为实现人民的付托而奋斗到底！一定要在解放台湾的战斗中把自己锻炼得更加强大无敌！
    我们应当严正地警告那些敌视中国人民的战争挑拨者：已经站起来的中国人民，决不允许任何帝国主义来侵犯中国的神圣领土，任何讹诈政策更吓唬不倒我们。伟大的中国人民革命的历史，再一次地证实了我们的一个牢不可破的信念：觉醒了的人民力量是无敌的。
