    Henan Province's Xuchang tobacco leaves are now on the market.
    A large quantity of new tobacco leaves from Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, a famous tobacco-producing area in our country, are now on the market. Currently, 400,000 jin of tobacco leaves are available daily in Xuchang City, and over 1.6 million jin of tobacco leaves are available daily throughout the prefecture. The amount of tobacco leaves purchased by the state in Xuchang Prefecture in September increased by 59.3% compared to August, and the amount purchased in early October continued to increase. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams that have signed tobacco sales contracts with state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives are collectively selling their tobacco leaves to the state according to the time specified in the contracts. On October 9th and 10th, twenty-four agricultural production cooperatives and nine mutual aid teams in Xiangcheng County collectively sold 7,995 jin of tobacco. After selling their tobacco leaves, most tobacco-growing farmers bought back production materials from supply and marketing cooperatives to expand reproduction. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河南省许昌烟叶上市
    我国著名的烟叶产区——河南省许昌专区新烟叶大量上市。现在许昌市每日有四十万斤烟叶上市，全专区每日上市的烟叶有一百六十万多斤。九月份国家在许昌专区收购的烟叶比八月份增加百分之五十九点三，十月上旬收购量仍在继续增加。和国营公司、供销合作社订了售烟合同的农业生产合作社、互助组，都按照合同规定的时间集体把烟叶卖给国家。襄城县二十四个农业生产合作社和九个互助组，十月九、十两日，集体卖烟七千九百九十五斤。种烟的农民在出售烟叶后，大多数都从供销合作社买回生产资料，扩大再生产。　（新华社）
