Shanghai and Wuhan Hospitals
Achieve Good Results Treating Amoebic Dysentery with the Chinese Medicine "Pulsatilla"

Shanghai and Wuhan hospitals have achieved good results using the Chinese medicine "Pulsatilla" to treat amoebic dysentery. At Shanghai Seventh People's Hospital, sixteen patients with amoebic dysentery have been cured by taking "Pulsatilla" in the past two months. The cure rate reached 100%. Wuhan Third People's Hospital used a preparation made from the root of "Pulsatilla" to treat eighteen patients with amoebic dysentery in July, and all of them recovered completely without any side effects. The patients stayed in the hospital for a maximum of fourteen days and a minimum of only three days, with most staying around five or six days.

"Pulsatilla" is an herbaceous plant that is produced in most parts of China. Zhang Zhongjing, a famous doctor of the Han Dynasty in China, had already used "Pulsatilla" to treat dysentery in his book "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber." In order to carry forward the legacy of Chinese medicine, doctors in Shanghai and Wuhan hospitals used the roots and stems of "Pulsatilla" to treat patients with amoebic dysentery. Among the sixteen cases at Shanghai Seventh People's Hospital, one patient no longer had amoeba in their stool one day after taking the medicine; one patient only recovered after fifteen days of treatment. Most patients were treated with only "Pulsatilla," while a small number of patients were given a small amount of camphor tincture to help relieve pain, and no side effects were found. The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Medical Association and the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association jointly held a symposium on expanding the trial use of "Pulsatilla" on October 10th. Now, major hospitals in Wuhan have decided to formally conduct trials. State-owned Wuhan Pharmaceutical Factory has begun production, called "Pulsatilla Root Fluid Extract." The first batch of twenty boxes has been sent to hospitals in Wuhan for application. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海和武汉市两所医院
    用中药“白头翁”治疗阿米巴痢疾效果很好
    上海、武汉两所医院用中药“白头翁”治疗阿米巴痢疾获得很好效果。上海市立第七人民医院两个月以来，已有十六个患阿米巴痢疾的病人服用“白头翁”得到痊愈。治愈率达百分之百。武汉市立第三医院在七月份用“白头翁”根制成的药剂治疗十八个患阿米巴痢疾的病人，结果全部痊愈，并且没有副作用。这些病人住院的日子，最多的十四天，最少的仅三天，多数在五、六天左右。
    “白头翁”是一种草本植物，我国大部地区都有出产。我国汉朝名医张仲景在他的著作“金匮要略”中早有使用“白头翁”医治痢疾的记载。上海和武汉两所医院的医师为了发扬祖国医学遗产，对阿米巴痢疾患者使用“白头翁”的根、茎部进行治疗。在上海市立第七人民医院的十六个病例中，有一例经服药一天后大便中就找不到阿米巴；有一例治疗十五天以后才痊愈，对大部分病人只用“白头翁”一种药治疗，对一部分病人加用少量樟脑酊帮助止痛，并没有发现副作用。中华医学会武汉分会和中国药学会武汉分会曾在十月十日联合召开了扩大试用“白头翁”的座谈会。现在，武汉市各大医院都已决定正式试用。国营武汉制药厂已开始生产，名为“白头翁根流浸膏”。首批二十箱已送往武汉市各医院应用。（新华社）
