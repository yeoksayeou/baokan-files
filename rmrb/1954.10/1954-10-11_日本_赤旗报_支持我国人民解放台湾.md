Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Japanese "Akahata" published an editorial on September 28th entitled "Liberating Taiwan is the Path to Guaranteeing Peace in Asia and the World," commenting on the just cause of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan.

The editorial believes that the cause of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is not only to complete China's unification, but also to defend peace in Asia and the world, and to stop the aggression of the American imperialists against Asia. Therefore, the liberation of Taiwan is not only the demand of the Chinese people, including those residing in Taiwan, but also the demand of people who love peace in Asia and the world.

The editorial pointed out the conspiracy of the American imperialists to invade and occupy Taiwan. The editorial said: "When the United States launched the aggressive war in Korea, it simultaneously sent its Seventh Fleet to invade and occupy Taiwan. The 'neutralization of Taiwan' touted by the American authorities is a complete lie. In fact, the American imperialists took the war of aggression against Korea as the first step in their aggression against the People's Republic of China, and also took the occupation of Taiwan as one of their preparatory actions." The editorial also said: "Since the Chiang Kai-shek clique was driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people and fled to Taiwan, Taiwan has become a complete American colony in military, political, and economic terms, and has become a powder keg in Asia."

The editorial refuted the proposals of foreign bourgeois newspapers advocating the "neutralization" of Taiwan and placing Taiwan under the trusteeship of the United Nations. The editorial believes that this proposal not only violates the will of the Chinese people, but also violates the interests of the people of all countries who demand peace in Asia and the world and demand independence. The editorial said: "Everyone is very clear that Taiwan has been a part of Chinese territory for more than a thousand years, and the vast majority of Taiwan's residents were moved from the Chinese mainland. During the fifty years that Japanese imperialism turned Taiwan into its own colony, Taiwan became a sharp knife that Japanese imperialism drove into the heart of China and an advanced base for aggression against Southeast Asia. Now, the United States has replaced Japanese imperialism and continues to use Taiwan as an advanced base for suppressing the people of Asia."

The editorial concluded: "The just cause of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, with the support and endorsement of the people of the world, and with the united efforts of the entire Chinese people, will surely achieve its goal."

    日本“赤旗报”支持我国人民解放台湾
      【新华社十日讯】东京消息：日本“赤旗报”在九月二十八日发表了题为“解放台湾是保障亚洲和全世界和平的道路”的社论，评述中国人民解放台湾的正义事业。
    社论认为：中国人民解放台湾的事业，不仅是为了完成中国的统一，同时也是为了保卫亚洲和全世界的和平、制止美帝国主义者向亚洲的侵略。因此，解放台湾不单是包括居住台湾的人们在内的中国人民的要求，也是爱好亚洲和全世界和平的人们的要求。
    社论指出了美帝国主义者侵占台湾的阴谋。社论说：“在美国发动了侵略朝鲜战争的时候，就同时派遣它的第七舰队侵占了台湾。美国当局所说的
  ‘台湾中立化’完全是一片谎言，实际上，美帝国主义者是把侵略朝鲜的战争作为侵略中华人民共和国的第一步，同时又把侵占台湾作为它的准备行动之一。”社论还说：“自从蒋介石集团被中国人民驱逐出大陆逃亡台湾后，台湾在军事、政治、经济上已经完全变成了美国的殖民地，变成了亚洲的火药库。”
    社论驳斥了外国资产阶级报纸所宣称的使台湾“中立化”和把台湾交给联合国托管的主张。社论认为：这种主张不但违反中国人民的意志，而且也违背要求亚洲和全世界和平，要求独立的各国人民的利益。社论说：“任何人都非常清楚，台湾早在一千几百年以前就是中国领土的一部分，台湾的绝大部分居民是由中国大陆移去的。日本帝国主义者在把台湾变成它自己的殖民地的五十年内，台湾就成了日本帝国主义者楔入中国心腹的一把尖刀和侵略东南亚的前进基地。现在，美国又代替了日本帝国主义，继续把台湾作为镇压亚洲人民的前进基地。”
    社论最后说：“中国人民解放台湾的正义事业，在全世界人民的支持和拥护下，在全中国人民的团结努力之下，一定会达到目的。”
