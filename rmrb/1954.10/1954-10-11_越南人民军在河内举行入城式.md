Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, October 10th: This reporter reports from Hanoi: The Vietnam People's Army held an entry ceremony in Hanoi on the morning of the 10th from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, proceeding along the western and southern routes. These two magnificent and orderly formations were composed of infantry, mechanized infantry, artillery, and anti-aircraft units. Wang Chengwǔ, Chairman of the Hanoi Military and Administrative Committee, and Dr. Chen Weixing, Vice-Chairman, also entered the city with the army.

Forty thousand people in Hanoi warmly welcomed their troops. The mighty soldiers entered the city amidst songs, cheers, and flowers.

On the morning of the 10th, people from all walks of life in Hanoi flocked to the main streets of Weixin Street and Shanxi Road, where the army would pass, and the commercial district of "Hoan Kiem Lake," where the entering troops would converge. They marched, waving golden star red flags and various slogans. Overseas Chinese also participated in the welcoming crowd. By 8:00 AM, the sidewalks on both sides of Weixin Street and other main streets were packed with these joyous people. Arches were set up on the streets. Huge banners welcoming the People's Army into the city were hung over the tree-lined streets. Among these banners were: "Welcome the triumphant return of our own troops," "Long live the Vietnam People's Army, which fights heroically for the people and the motherland," "Long live Ho Chi Minh," "Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam," "Long live the independence of the motherland," and "Long live peace."

At 11:00 AM, under the bright sunshine, the modernized Vietnam People's Army began to enter the capital. Guided by a huge golden star red flag, infantry columns with submachine guns slung across their chests and machine guns on their shoulders marched in step along the wide streets. A long string of large trucks was filled with mechanized infantry, heavy mortar gunners, mountain artillerymen, anti-aircraft gun units, and howitzer artillerymen. The procession included heavy mortars, mountain guns, anti-aircraft machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, and huge howitzers. Some of these cannons were seized during the Hoa Binh Campaign in 1952, some came from the Nghĩa Lộ Campaign in 1953, and more came from the Dien Bien Phu Campaign this year. The soldiers were young and strong, and their serious red and black faces were filled with smiles.

The procession was greeted with cheers and songs. Young people clapped and sang in turn: "Hurray, hurray, brothers return to the capital! Hurray, hurray, brothers return triumphantly to the capital!" The victorious soldiers marched through the jubilant crowd, occasionally slowing down to shake the hands extended from the roadside, constantly accepting bouquets of flowers handed to them. Colorful confetti showered down from the buildings, covering the soldiers, and colorful paper bags hung on the dark green military vehicles and cannons.

As the southern route army approached Hoan Kiem Lake, the joyful crowd squeezed the road narrower and narrower, some simply climbing onto vehicles to greet the soldiers. People on and off the vehicles waved and exchanged flowers, paying their respects and shouting "Long live President Ho!" A woman in her thirties grabbed a soldier's hand and said excitedly:
  "You have finally returned!" The young soldier replied:
  "We have returned!"

The two routes of troops participating in the entry ceremony on the 10th were the heroic units from the "Capital Defense War" from December 19, 1946, to February 1947. At that time, they numbered only 2,500 in total, and under the command of General Wang Chengwǔ, they fought house-to-house against 6,500 French troops equipped with airplanes, tanks, and artillery, using rifles, shotguns, and broadswords. After more than two months of bloody battles, they broke through the encirclement after completing their mission. They were awarded the title of "Capital Regiment" and President Ho's red flag of "Determined to Fight and Win." For more than seven years, they have traveled across mountains and rivers, attacking the enemy everywhere. They have participated in battles in Lạng Sơn, Cao Bằng, Điện Biên Phủ, and other regions. Today, on the 81st day after winning peace, they have returned to Hanoi to reunite with the people who once supported them with all their strength to resist the enemy and defend the capital.

At 3:00 PM, the troops who entered Hanoi held a flag-raising ceremony on the large stadium at the south gate of the ancient imperial city, presided over by the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Hanoi Military and Administrative Committee. When the military music and chimes announced the start of the flag-raising ceremony, many people who were not present automatically stood at attention in their places to pay their respects.

    越南人民军在河内举行入城式
     【新华社北越十日电】本社记者自河内报道：越南人民军十日上午十一时到十二时分西、南两路举行了入城式。这两支雄壮、整齐的队列是以步兵、机械化步兵、炮兵和对空射击部队组成的。河内军政委员会主席王承武少将和副主席陈维兴博士也随军进城。
    河内四十万人民热烈地欢迎了自己的部队。威武的战士们在歌声、欢呼声和鲜花丛中开入城内。
    十日清晨，河内各阶层人民就一队队涌向大军将要经过的维新街和山西路以及入城部队会师的“还剑湖”滨商业区的主要街道。他们手执金星红旗和各色标语，欢呼着行进。华侨也参加了欢迎的队伍。八点多钟，维新街等大街两旁的人行道就挤满了这些欢乐的人群。街道上扎起了一道道彩门。横挂在林荫道上的是迎接人民军入城的巨幅标语。这些标语中有：“欢迎自己的部队凯旋归来”、“为人民和祖国而英勇战斗的越南人民军万岁”、“胡志明万岁”、“越南民主共和国万岁”、“祖国的独立万岁”、“和平万岁”。
    十一点钟，在阳光照耀下，现代化的越南人民军部队开始进入首都。在巨幅金星红旗的引导下，胸前挂着冲锋枪和肩上扛着机关枪的步兵纵队，在宽阔的街道上齐步前进。一长串大卡车上满载着机械化步兵、重迫击炮兵、山炮手、高射炮部队和榴弹炮兵。行列中有重迫击炮、山炮、高射机关枪、高射炮和巨大的榴弹炮。这些大炮有的是在一九五二年的和平战役中缴获的，有的来自一九五三年的义路战役，更多的则来自今年的奠边府战役。战士们年青而健壮，在他们红黑色的严肃的脸上流露着笑容。
    迎接着队伍的是一片欢呼声和歌声。青年们打着拍子轮番地唱着：“欢呼，欢呼哥哥们回到首都！欢呼，欢呼哥哥们凯旋回到首都！”胜利归来的战士们在狂欢的人群中间前进，他们不时放慢了脚步，紧握从路旁伸过来的手，不断接受迎面送来的一束束鲜花。从楼上撒下来的五彩纸花撒遍了战士们的全身，彩色纸袋挂在暗绿色的军车上和炮身上。
    南路大军进到还剑湖畔，欢乐的群众把路越挤越窄，有的干脆爬上汽车，向战士们问好。车上车下同时挥手摇花，互致敬意，齐喊“胡主席万岁！”一个三十来岁的妇女拉着一个战士的手激动地说：
  “你们终于回来了！”这个年轻的战士回答说：
  “我们回来了！”
    十日参加入城式的两路部队就是一九四六年十二月十九日到一九四七年二月“首都保卫战”中的英雄部队。当时他们总共只有两千五百人，在王承武将军的指挥下，以步枪、鸟枪、大刀对拥有飞机、坦克、大炮的六千五百名法军逐屋争夺，血战两个多月，完成任务后杀出重围。他们分别获得了“首都团”的称号和胡主席的“决战决胜”的红旗。七年多来他们跋涉山河，到处打击敌人。他们参加过谅山、高平、奠边府和其他地区的战斗。今天在赢得和平后的第八十一天，他们回到了河内，和曾经以一切力量支援他们抗击敌人、保卫首都的人民重新会面。
    下午三时，进入河内市的部队在河内军政委员会主席、副主席的主持下，在古皇城南门的大运动场上举行升旗典礼。当军乐声和钟声报告升旗典礼开始时，许多没有到场的人都自动在原地肃立致敬。
