    Do a Good Job in Rural Savings Work
    Liu Hengzhi

    In the second half of this year, the state's task of purchasing agricultural products is greater than last year. The currency input is also more concentrated in terms of region and time than in previous years. In order to do a good job in currency withdrawal, in addition to doing a good job in supplying materials, recovering overdue state agricultural loans, and actively developing rural credit cooperatives, we must also vigorously develop rural grain and cotton preferential savings. Doing this work well can play two roles: First, it can absorb idle rural funds, withdraw currency, support procurement, and consolidate price stability; second, it can encourage farmers to save, accumulate production investment power, better arrange expanded reproduction, and restrict the development of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas.

    Last winter and this spring, in order to cooperate with the state in purchasing grain, local People's Banks held preferential savings in rural areas. Thanks to the unified leadership of party and government organs at all levels and the improvement of farmers' socialist consciousness, great achievements were made. Within three months, farmers saved a total of four trillion yuan to the state. It played an active role in supporting grain procurement, consolidating price stability, and helping farmers accumulate funds for spring plowing production and arrange for expanded reproduction. Therefore, it has been warmly supported by the majority of farmers, who generally reflected: "Preferential grain sales savings are a good method devised by the government for the farmers." They also said: "Storing grain only gives you ninety-nine, but deposits can turn into one hundred and ten." This fully shows that doing a good job in savings is beneficial to both the country and the farmers.

    This autumn and winter, the People's Bank will continue to expand the holding of preferential grain and cotton savings in order to cooperate with the grain and cotton purchasing work. In order to concentrate efforts to do this work well, the scope of preferential savings this autumn and winter is generally limited to grain and cotton, the two main materials purchased by the state according to plan. Other items should not be included, so as to avoid too wide a scope, which would disperse manpower and make it difficult to achieve practical results. However, individual areas where farmers request to hold preferential savings for oil crops may also be handled at discretion. In order to encourage farmers to sell grain and cotton to the state, the grain and cotton preferential savings this autumn and winter will still be given relatively favorable interest rates. It is determined that those who save for one to three months will receive a monthly interest rate of one point two percent; those who save for four to six months will receive a monthly interest rate of one point five percent.

    There are many favorable conditions for carrying out savings work this year. First of all, after last winter and this spring's publicity work, helping farmers to formulate production plans and spending plans, especially after this spring's active redemption work, dispelled farmers' concerns about "easy to deposit and difficult to withdraw," and thus won the support and trust of the majority of farmers. Secondly, local People's Banks have gained experience in carrying out savings. Thirdly, this year's arrangements for the second half of the year were made earlier, and all localities have had sufficient time to prepare, and can carry out the work simultaneously with the procurement work under the unified leadership and unified deployment of party and government organs at all levels. However, on the other hand, there are also difficulties in carrying out this work this autumn and winter, mainly because some areas have suffered varying degrees of rain and flood disasters, and farmers still have difficulties in production and life; last year, the publicity work for savings in some areas was not thorough, and some farmers still had concerns about savings; this year, there is a lot of rural work, and it is concentrated in one period, and our cadres are insufficient, which may lead to neglecting one thing for another. Therefore, we must make specific arrangements according to the different situations in each place.

    To do a good job in this year's grain and cotton preferential savings, we should mainly pay attention to mastering the following links:

    First of all, under the unified leadership of party and government at all levels, savings, recovery of overdue agricultural loans, and grain and cotton purchasing work should be closely combined, and unified arrangements, unified publicity, and unified organization of manpower should be made, so that it becomes an important component to ensure the victorious completion of the grain and cotton unified purchase task. In fact, these tasks are also inseparable. If we only pay attention to the unified purchase work and neglect the leadership of savings and loan recovery work, that is, relax the organization of currency withdrawal work, it will inevitably affect the supply of procurement funds and the stability of market prices. Last year, some areas did not pay enough attention to this point. They underestimated the great improvement of farmers' political consciousness after the publicity of the general line, and did not deeply understand the important significance of holding preferential grain savings. Therefore, they did not unify the absorption of savings with the grain purchasing work, and thought that carrying out grain purchasing and savings at the same time would affect the completion of the grain purchasing work, and pushed the savings work to after the completion of the grain purchasing work. As a result, both the grain purchasing work and the savings work were affected, and to varying degrees, it also fueled the spontaneous forces of farmers and unnecessary waste of life. This phenomenon must be corrected this year.

    Secondly, local People's Banks should, according to the tasks deployed by the higher authorities, under the unified leadership of the local party and government, and in conjunction with this year's procurement plan and the supply of materials, stipulate a control figure for completing the task. This control figure requires: on the one hand, it should be able to withdraw currency, maintain market stability, and encourage farmers to accumulate investment power for next year's expanded reproduction; on the other hand, it should also take into account the planned completion of the state's commodity sales plan and deliver industrial products to farmers in a timely manner. For example, in areas where there is more procurement of grain and cotton but the supply of materials cannot fully meet the needs of the masses, the task of savings and storage can be larger; in areas where there is less procurement, the task of savings and storage can be smaller. In bumper harvest areas and economic crop areas, the task of savings and storage should be completed and strive to exceed. In some areas with severe disasters, the task of savings and storage can generally not be arranged. When making specific arrangements for this work, all localities should grasp the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and prevent blindly expanding savings without considering the specific situation; and also prevent neglecting favorable conditions, being tied up, and letting things go.

    Third, to carry out preferential savings for grain and cotton, publicity and mobilization work should be done well. Savings work is not only an important economic work, but also a meticulous political work. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly carry out publicity and mobilization work to inspire farmers' enthusiasm for voluntarily participating in savings. In terms of the content of publicity, the interests of the state should be combined with the interests of individuals, and the long-term interests of farmers should be combined with the immediate interests. After repeated publicity, farmers will realize the benefits of savings for the country and for themselves, so that farmers can actively carry out savings on a completely voluntary basis. In the past, some areas did not dare to publicize savings to farmers, or the publicity work was not deep and thorough enough, and the significance of savings was not clearly explained to the masses, resulting in some rigid working methods and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Some comrades one-sidedly emphasized the benefits of savings for improving life, but neglected publicity from the political and production aspects, thus causing some farmers to have misconceptions in their thinking. These are all incorrect and must be corrected. Without doing a good job in publicity, and using any inappropriate rigid matching method, not only the work of purchasing, saving, etc. cannot be completed, but also political losses will be suffered. Whether the savings work can be done well, publicity work is a very important link.

    Fourth, in terms of the working methods for carrying out preferential savings for grain and cotton, the better experience of last year should be accepted. Many areas have created a lot of working experience in this regard. For example, some areas have created a "three-combination," that is, publicizing savings work while publicizing grain purchase policies, reporting savings plans when self-reporting the amount of grain to be sold, and handling savings procedures at the same time as paying for grain entering the warehouse. This greatly saves manpower, the procedures are simple, and it meets the requirements of farmers, so it is very effective, both completing the grain purchase work and completing the savings work. Qingyun County, Hebei Province, used this method in 114 villages, making the absorbed savings account for 40% of the grain purchase payment. In the future, this method can not only be used in carrying out savings work, but also in loan recovery work. Some areas purchase first and then save, with grain purchase work groups specializing in grain purchase and banks specializing in savings, mechanically separating grain purchase work from savings work, which is very ineffective, wasting manpower and delaying farmers' production.

    Widely entrusting rural credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives is an effective method to absorb savings and facilitate farmers' deposits and withdrawals. Credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives have a large number of institutions in rural areas, and if credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives are widely used, they will play a great role in savings work. Last winter and this spring, many areas entrusted credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives to handle preferential grain sales savings on behalf of them, which exceeded the expected results and were welcomed by farmers. Farmers said with satisfaction: "The government is really thoughtful, and you can deposit it without moving after selling grain, which is so convenient." When entrusting credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives to handle grain and cotton preferential savings on behalf of them, the specific procedures and methods must be clearly explained, and timely help and inspection should be provided. The procedures should be simplified as much as possible to facilitate farmers.

    In the process of carrying out savings and storage work, the higher-level banking organs should also organize working groups to go to lower-level units in a timely manner to conduct inspections, help them solve problems in their work, overcome shortcomings in their work; and at the same time pay attention to cultivating typical examples and organize timely exchange of experience, which is one of the important methods to promote work.

    Finally, after the expiration of the grain and cotton preferential savings, unconditional guarantee of redemption should be guaranteed, which is an important prerequisite for laying a good foundation for continuing to carry out savings in the future. Adhering to credit and guaranteeing redemption upon expiration is very important for timely supporting farmers' funding needs for expanding reproduction. It is of great significance for improving farmers' trust in the state's savings work and laying a good foundation for continuing savings in the future. The redemption work itself is a powerful publicity work. Farmers are the most practical. If the publicity is done well, but it cannot be fulfilled in practice, it will not gain the trust of farmers. Therefore, attention should be paid to preventing the "happy to deposit and dislike to pay" mentality that may arise in the expired redemption work. However, many farmers still request to continue saving after the savings expire, and this enthusiasm should be welcomed. In order to ensure that farmers can withdraw upon expiration, sufficient funds should be prepared in advance to prevent the phenomenon of insufficient funds during the redemption period. Before the redemption work begins, it should also be studied jointly with the material supply department to prepare for the supply of materials, especially the supply of production materials, so that farmers can buy production materials when they get the money. In order to facilitate farmers to withdraw upon expiration, the savings and storage unit should guarantee payment upon arrival and should not be mechanically limited to office hours. In areas that are far away, mobile teams can be organized to go to the countryside for redemption. Some areas have adopted a "fixed time, fixed point, fixed line" mobile work method for redemption in various townships, which is relatively good. When entrusting credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives to redeem, the redemption procedures and calculation methods should be taught to avoid unclear accounting.

    The task of grain and cotton preferential savings in the second half of this year is very heavy, but as long as we are under the unified leadership of party and government at all levels, closely combine with the grain and cotton purchase work, correctly grasp the policies, overcome and correct incorrect ideas and practices, and make full preparations, the task of grain and cotton preferential savings in the second half of this year can be completed.

    做好农村储蓄工作
    刘恒志
    今年下半年，国家对农产品收购的任务大于去年。货币的投放在地区上、时间上也较往年更加集中。为了做好货币回笼工作，除了做好物资供应工作、收回到期的国家农业贷款和积极发展农村信用合作组织等工作以外，还必须大力开展农村粮棉优待储蓄工作。做好这一工作，就可以起到两个作用：一是吸收农村闲歇资金，回笼货币，支持收购，巩固物价稳定；一是鼓励农民节约，积蓄生产投资力量，更好地安排扩大再生产，并限制农村资本主义自发势力的发展。
    去冬今春，为了配合国家收购粮食，各地人民银行在农村举办了优待储蓄，由于各级党政机关的统一领导，农民社会主义觉悟的提高，取得了很大成绩。在三个月内，农民共向国家储蓄达四万亿元。对于支持粮食收购，巩固物价的稳定，和帮助农民积累春耕生产资金，安排扩大再生产，均起了积极作用。因而得到了广大农民的热烈拥护，农民普遍反映：“优待售粮储蓄是政府替农民想出的好办法。”又说：“存粮只有九十九，存款还能变成一百一。”这充分说明做好储蓄工作对于国家，对于农民都是有利的。
    今年秋冬季人民银行为配合粮、棉收购工作，仍继续扩大举办粮棉优待储蓄。为了集中力量把这一工作做好，今年秋冬季举办优待储蓄的范围，一般只限于国家计划收购的粮食和棉花两种主要物资，其他不宜举办，以免范围太宽，使人力分散，难收实效。但个别地区如农民要求举办油料优待储蓄者，亦可酌情办理。为了鼓励农民出售粮、棉给国家的积极性，今年秋冬季的粮棉优待储蓄，仍给以较优厚的利息。确定存满一个月至三个月者，月息一分二厘；存满四个月至六个月者，月息一分五厘。
    今年开展储蓄工作有利的条件很多。首先，经过去冬今春的宣传工作，帮助农民订生产谱、用钱谱，特别是经过今春的积极兑付工作，解除了农民“存易取难”的顾虑，因而得到广大农民的拥护与信任。其次，各地人民银行均有了开展储蓄的经验。再次，今年下半年这一工作布置较早，各地有了充分的时间准备，能够在各级党政机关的统一领导和统一布置之下，结合收购工作同时进行，但是，在另一方面，今年秋冬季开展这一工作，也是存在着困难的，主要是在部分地区，受了不同程度的雨涝灾害，农民在生产、生活上还有困难；去年有些地区对储蓄工作的宣传不深入，部分农民对储蓄还有顾虑；今年农村工作很多，又是集中在一个时期进行的，而我们干部力量不足，这就可能发生顾此失彼的现象。因此，必须根据各地的不同情况，具体安排。
    做好今年的粮棉优待储蓄工作，主要应注意掌握以下几个环节：
    首先应在各级党政的统一领导下，把储蓄、收回到期的农业贷款和粮、棉收购工作紧密结合起来，统一布置、统一宣传、统一组织人力，使其成为保证粮棉统购任务胜利完成的一个重要组成部分。事实上，这几项工作也是不可分离的。如果只注意到统购工作，而忽视对储蓄和收贷工作的领导，就是说放松了组织回笼货币工作，就必然影响到收购资金供应和市场物价的稳定。去年有些地区，对于这一点重视是不够的，他们对于宣传总路线以后，农民政治觉悟的大大提高估计不足，对于举办粮食优待储蓄的重要意义没有深刻认识。因而没有把吸收储蓄与购粮工作统一结合起来，认为购粮与开展储蓄同时进行会影响购粮工作的完成，把储蓄工作推到购粮工作完成以后再去做。结果，使购粮工作和储蓄工作都受到了影响，而且也在不同程度上助长了农民的自发势力和不必要的生活浪费。这种现象今年必须纠正。
    其次，各地人民银行应根据上级所布置的任务，在当地党政的统一领导下，结合今年的收购计划及物资供应情况，规定一个完成任务的控制数字。这个控制数字要求：一方面要达到能够回笼货币，保持市场稳定和鼓励农民积累明年扩大再生产的投资力量；另一方面，也要照顾到按计划完成国家的商品推销计划，把工业品及时送到农民手中。比如在收购粮、棉较多而物资供应又不能充分满足群众需要的地区，收储的任务就可大一些；收购较少的地区，收储任务就可小一些。在丰收区和经济作物区，应完成并争取超过收储任务。在某些灾情较重的地区，一般可不布置收储任务。各地在具体布置这一工作时，应掌握实事求是的精神，既要防止不根据具体情况，盲目扩大储蓄；也要防止忽视有利条件，束手束脚，放任自流，第三、开展粮棉优待储蓄，应做好宣传动员工作。储蓄工作不但是一个重要的经济工作，而且也是一个细致的政治工作。因此，必须深入地做好宣传动员工作，以启发农民自愿参加储蓄的积极性。在宣传的内容上，应把国家利益与个人利益结合起来，把农民的长远利益和眼前利益结合起来。这样经过反复地宣传以后，农民就会认识到储蓄对国家和对自己的好处，从而使农民在完全自愿的基础上积极进行储蓄。过去有的地区不敢向农民宣传储蓄或宣传工作做得不深不透，没有把储蓄的意义向群众交代清楚，因而产生了某些硬性的工作方法，引起群众不满。有的同志片面地强调储蓄对提高生活的好处，却忽略了从政治上和生产上的宣传，因而使部分农民在思想上产生了错觉。这些都是不正确的，必须纠正。不做好宣传工作，而用任何不适当的硬性搭配方法，不但收购、储蓄等工作不能完成，而且在政治上也会受到损失。储蓄工作能否做好，宣传工作是很重要的一环。
    第四，在开展粮棉优待储蓄的工作方法上，应接受去年的较好经验。不少地区在这方面创造了不少的工作经验。比如有的地区创造了“三结合”，即在宣传粮食收购政策的同时宣传储蓄工作，在自报售粮数目时自报储蓄计划，在粮仓入库支款的同时办理储蓄手续。这样就大大节省了人力，手续简便，适合了农民的要求，因而收效很大，既完成了粮食收购工作，也完成了储蓄工作。河北省庆云县有一百一十四个村运用这一方法，使吸收的储蓄占到了购粮款的百分之四十。今后这一方法不仅在开展储蓄工作中可以运用，而且在收贷工作中也可以运用。有的地区先收购、后储蓄，购粮工作组专作购粮，银行专作储蓄，机械地把购粮工作与储蓄工作分开，收效就很小，既浪费了人力，也耽搁了农民生产。
    广泛委托农村信用合作社、供销合作社是吸收储蓄和便利农民存取的有效方法。信用合作社、供销合作社在农村有着广大的机构，如果普遍地把信用合作社、供销合作社运用起来，就会对储蓄工作起到很大的作用。去冬和今春不少地区委托信用合作社、供销合作社代办优待售粮储蓄，均超过了预期的效果，而且得到了农民欢迎。农民满意地说：“政府想的真周到，卖粮后不动地方就可存上，太方便了。”在委托信用合作社、供销合作社代办粮棉优待储蓄时，必须把具体手续和作法交代清楚，并及时加以帮助和检查。在手续上应力求简化，便利农民。
    在收储工作的进行中，上级银行机关还应组织工作组及时到下层单位进行检查。帮助他们解决工作中的问题，克服工作中的缺点；同时注意培养典型，及时组织经验交流，这是推动工作的重要方法之一。
    最后，粮棉优待储蓄到期以后，应无条件地保证兑付，这是为今后继续开展储蓄打好基础的重要前提。坚守信用，到期保证兑付，对于及时支持农民扩大再生产的资金需要。对于提高农民对国家举办储蓄工作的信任，和给今后继续储蓄打好基础，都有很大的意义。兑付工作本身，就是一个强有力的宣传工作。农民是最讲求实际的，如果做好了宣传，而在实际中不能履行，就不能得到农民的信任。因此，应注意防止在到期的兑付工作中可能产生的“喜存厌付”思想。但不少农民在储蓄到期以后，仍要求继续储蓄，这种热情是应该受到欢迎的。为了保证农民到期支取，应事前准备足够的资金，以防止兑付期中资金不足的现象。在兑付工作开始以前，还应与物资供应部门共同研究，作好物资供应准备工作，特别是生产资料的供应，使农民拿到钱能买到生产资料。为了便利农民到期提取，收储单位应保证随到随付，不应机械的局限于办公时间。在距离较远的地区，可组织流动组下乡兑付。有的地区采取“定时、定点、定线”流动在各乡兑付的工作方法，是比较好的。在委托信用合作社、供销合作社兑付时，应教会兑付手续与计算方法，以免帐务错乱不清。
    今年下半年粮棉优待储蓄的任务是很繁重的，但只要我们在各级党政的统一领导下，紧密与粮、棉收购工作相结合，正确地掌握政策，克服和纠正不正确的思想和做法，充分作好准备，今年下半年粮棉优待储蓄工作的任务是可以完成的。
