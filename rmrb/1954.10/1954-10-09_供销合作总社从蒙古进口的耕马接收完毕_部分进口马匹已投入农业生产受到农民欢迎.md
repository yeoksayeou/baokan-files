The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has completed receiving more than 10,000 plough horses imported from the Mongolian People's Republic this year by the end of September. Now, this batch of imported horses is being transported from the receiving point – Lama Kulun, Inner Mongolia – to Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin and other places by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Cooperative Union. Some of the horses have already been put into agricultural production and are very popular with farmers.

The government and people of the Mongolian People's Republic strongly supported our country's work in importing these horses. The horse inspection team sent by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to the Mongolian People's Republic, with the support of the Mongolian People's Republic government, completed the inspection of more than 10,000 plough horses in only two months. The work of transporting and handing over the horses progressed rapidly, and from the end of July to September 17, 10,371 plough horses were transported into our country. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives originally planned to train and tame the horses for a period of time after they were transported in, and then supply them to the farmers; however, because the government and people of the Mongolian People's Republic gave priority to supplying us with trained horses, most of the imported horses do not need to be trained before they can be used. This not only saves training expenses and reduces the cost of horses, but also supplies the farmers' needs in advance and supports agricultural production.

The supply and marketing cooperatives in various areas that have been allocated imported horses have already made preparations for supplying the horses. Generally, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have signed pre-purchase contracts with agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers who need horses. Now, horses in many areas such as Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, have been supplied to farmers, and after a short period of adapting to their new environment, they have been put into agricultural production. Many farmers have praised these imported horses for being strong and powerful, and reasonably priced, making them very suitable for farmers who use new agricultural tools.

    供销合作总社从蒙古进口的耕马接收完毕
    部分进口马匹已投入农业生产受到农民欢迎
    中华全国供销合作总社今年从蒙古人民共和国进口的一万多匹耕马，已经于九月底以前接收完毕。现在这批进口马匹正由内蒙古自治区合作社联合社负责从接收地点——内蒙古喇嘛库伦，陆续赶运到黑龙江、辽宁、吉林等地。部分马匹已经投入农业生产，农民非常喜爱。
    蒙古人民共和国政府和蒙古人民大力支持我国进口这项马匹的工作。中华全国供销合作总社派赴蒙古人民共和国的验马工作队在蒙古人民共和国政府支持下，仅用两个月的时间就把一万多匹耕马验收完毕。赶运接交工作进展很快，从七月末到九月十七日，就有一万零三百七十一匹耕马运入我国境内。中华全国供销合作总社原来计划把马匹运到以后，进行一段时间的调教、驯服，再供应给农民；由于蒙古人民共和国政府和蒙古人民尽先将驯服的马匹供给我国，进口的马匹大部分都不需要经过调教就能使用。这样不仅节省了调教开支，降低了马匹成本，还提前供应了农民的需要，支持了农业生产。
    各个分配到进口马匹的供销合作社早已进行了供应马匹的准备工作。各地供销合作社一般都和需要马匹的农业生产合作社、互助组及个体农民签订了预购合同。现在黑龙江省桦川县等不少地区的马匹已经供应到农民手中，经过短时间改变生活习惯，便投入了农业生产。许多农民称赞这些进口马匹体壮力强，价格合适，很适合使用新式农具的农民的需要。
