Shenyang State-Owned Factories Exceed Third Quarter Total Output Value Plan
After sixty-six state-owned factories in Shenyang launched a labor emulation campaign, they exceeded this year's third quarter total production value plan, averaging 4.5% above the plan. Among them, the factories in Shenyang under the five central industrial ministries averaged 3.3% above the plan. State-owned machinery and electrical appliance factories trial-produced more than 120 new products in the third quarter. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant successfully trial-produced 15 new products, including China's first 150-ton crankshaft cutting machine and a crusher capable of loading 160 train cars of crushed material per day and night; the water pump factory trial-produced more than 20 new water pumps. Many factories are manufacturing precision parts and machines to support basic construction projects such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and Daye Steel Plant.
