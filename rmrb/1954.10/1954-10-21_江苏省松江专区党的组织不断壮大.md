    The organization of the Chinese Communist Party in Songjiang Special District, Jiangsu Province, has continuously grown stronger amidst the steady development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. In the more than four hundred agricultural producers' cooperatives organized in the spring, the number of Party members increased by about one-half compared to before the establishment of the cooperatives. The more than eighteen hundred newly established producers' cooperatives are also gradually establishing Party grassroots organizations, and it is expected that each cooperative will have a branch or group before the spring of next year. The Party branch of the Lianmin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Songjiang County continuously conducts socialist education among its members, and the number of Party members has now increased by more than double the original number. The five Party members of the Hongqi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Nanhui County organized a propaganda network within the cooperative, frequently using collectivist ideology to educate members to produce and labor according to plan. This cooperative has already achieved a bumper harvest of summer crops, and autumn rice and cotton production are also expected to increase. Seven outstanding members of the cooperative have successively joined the Party, and a branch has now been established. Party members in the forty-eight agricultural producers' cooperatives in Qingpu County are playing exemplary roles, and Party branches or groups have been established in thirty-three of these cooperatives.
    Recently, more than two thousand Communist Party members in nine counties of the entire special district have led tens of thousands of farmers to build more than eighteen hundred agricultural producers' cooperatives. The Songjiang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the county committees had previously held fifteen short-term training courses, systematically educating the activists who emerged in the mutual aid and cooperation movement about communism and the Communist Party. More than half of the eight thousand trainees who participated in the study were non-Party activists, and most of them expressed their desire to strive for Party membership by doing a good job in the newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives after returning to their villages.

    江苏省松江专区党的组织不断壮大
    江苏省松江专区中国共产党的组织在农业生产合作社的稳步发展中不断壮大。在春季组织起来的四百多个农业生产合作社里，党员人数比建社前增加二分之一左右。最近新建的一千八百多个生产合作社也在逐步建立党的基层组织，预计明年春季以前可以达到每社有支部或小组。松江县联民农业生产合作社的党的支部在社员中不断进行社会主义教育，现在党员人数较原有党员人数增加一倍以上。南汇县红旗农业生产合作社的五个党员在社内组织宣传网，经常用集体主义思想教育社员按计划生产和劳动。这个社夏季作物已得到丰收，秋季水稻和棉花也可增产，全社有七个优秀的社员先后入党，现在已成立了支部。青浦县的四十八个农业生产合作社都有党员起着模范作用，其中三十三个社已建立了党的支部或小组。
    最近，全专区九个县又有两千多个共产党员领导几万农民建成一千八百多个农业生产合作社。中共松江地方委员会和各县委员会事先曾先后举办了十五期短期训练班，对互助合作运动中涌现出来的积极分子有计划地进行共产主义和共产党的教育。参加学习的八千多个学员中半数以上是非党积极分子，他们大部分都表示要以回到村子后搞好新建农业生产合作社的实际行动来争取入党。
