Five Years of Water Management
National People's Congress Representative
Minister of Water Resources, Fu Zuoyi

In the past five years, I have been deeply moved by the many vivid facts of New China's construction in all aspects. In water conservancy construction, because I personally participated, I feel it even more profoundly.

The creativity of our working people is great. Thousands of years ago, we built huge water conservancy projects like the Dujiangyan Irrigation System and the Grand Canal, which are still enjoyed by the people today. However, due to the long-term stagnation of feudal society and the serious destruction during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, China's water conservancy construction was not developed. When the country was liberated in 1949 and the Central People's Government was established, most of the river dikes and embankments in the country were in a state of disrepair. For example, the Huai River basin was ravaged by the muddy waters of the Yellow River for as long as nine years, but after the Yellow River returned to its old course, the reactionary government did not carry out any management of the Huai River. Most of the water storage ponds and dams in the rice-growing areas of the south of the Yangtze River were also damaged.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, water conservancy is regarded as one of the main means of developing industrial and agricultural production, and as a major event in the lives of all the people. As soon as the people's revolution achieved victory, water conservancy construction began to develop vigorously throughout the country.

In the past five years, the flood control projects undertaken by the state and the flood fighting struggles of the people across the country have played an important role in reducing flood disasters. Although the Yellow River has not yet been fundamentally managed, in the seven years from the liberation of the lower reaches of the Yellow River in 1947 to the present, several major floods have been defended by relying solely on dikes and flood control measures, without any serious disasters occurring. The huge Huai River management project is a basin management project covering a vast area of 280,000 square kilometers. This project is carried out in two steps according to the principle of emphasizing the upper, middle and lower reaches and combining storage and drainage. The first step is to eliminate flood and waterlogging disasters under ordinary rainstorm conditions, and the second step is to eliminate extraordinary flood disasters and make overall plans for water conservancy development. In the face of this year's extraordinary flood, the downstream areas, because of the construction of the Sanhe Sluice and the irrigation canal, plus the control of floods in the upper and middle reaches, basically avoided the disaster of the Huai River flood and fully guaranteed the agricultural production in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu. The middle reaches basically guaranteed the safety of the Huaibei Plain east of the Wo River, the smooth traffic on the Jinpu Railway, and the protection of industrial cities such as Bengbu and Huainan. In the upper reaches, under the control of flood storage projects in various reservoirs and lakes and depressions, the disaster was also alleviated. The Yangtze River encountered the largest flood in a century this year. The Jingjiang Dike, under the rational use of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and the resolute defense of hundreds of thousands of flood fighters, successfully passed through five dangerous flood peaks. The water level in Wuhan exceeded the highest water level in 1931 by 1.45 meters, and the time exceeding the past highest water level lasted for 58 days. The dikes of more than 100 kilometers have been heightened and reinforced in five phases, and the water has risen and the dikes have risen, finally ensuring the safety of Wuhan.

The Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River is an important hub for the Yongding River to benefit and eliminate harm. In the future, with the downstream flood control project, the flood disaster in the lower reaches of the Yongding River can be completely eliminated. The Yongding River had the second largest flood in hydrological records last year, and no disaster occurred. In the northeast, the Dahuo房 Reservoir has begun to be built on the Hun River, a tributary of the Liao River. In terms of river dredging, the Chaobai River in Hebei has opened up a new river course; the Duliu Reduction River opened up in the lower reaches of the Daqing River and the Ziya River played an important role in the struggle to defend Tianjin this year. The new river courses of the Yi River and the Shu River in eastern China have alleviated the continuous water disasters in this area for ten years. The Pearl River Delta has also built many joint enclosure and sluice gate projects, which play an important role in flood control and drainage.

At the same time as river management, farmland water conservancy projects have also been widely developed. In the past five years, a total of more than 8.4 million channels, ponds and dams have been renovated and built across the country, and more than 900,000 new wells have been dug. Through these facilities, in addition to the improved irrigation area of farmland, the total increase in irrigation area is more than 61 million mu. This figure is about one-sixth of the area of paddy fields accumulated and developed in China over thousands of years.

Through the practice of water conservancy construction and the learning of advanced Soviet experience, China's water conservancy construction technology has also been rapidly improved. Before liberation, China did not build its own large-scale reservoirs. Now six reservoirs have been completed across the country, and three others are under construction, including earth dam reservoirs and reinforced concrete arch dam reservoirs as high as more than 70 meters. Before liberation, no large sluice gates had been built. In the past five years, the huge sluice gates built in China, such as the Hong Gate of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion, which is 1,054 meters long, and the Sanhe Sluice Gate of the Huai River, which is 9.5 meters high and 697 meters long, have all been tested by this year's extraordinary floods and can be operated freely. In addition, the mechanization of construction is gradually being promoted in river dredging and reservoir dam projects. I have met many old engineers who were born in old China, each with a half-life of bumpy experiences. Some people have read books on water conservancy science at home and abroad, but when they have gray hair, they cannot find an opportunity to build a project with their own hands in old China. Now, construction projects are being built everywhere, and technical personnel are needed everywhere. Old engineers are respected everywhere, and young engineers all have great prospects. Everyone who studies technology will confirm what I am saying.

Our country is a large country spanning the cold, temperate and tropical zones. It is impossible to completely eliminate drought and flood disasters in a short period of time. Under this year's extraordinary rainstorm, the Huai River basin and parts of Hebei Province suffered waterlogging and flood disasters. Through the efforts of the people in various places, although the degree of disaster was effectively reduced, the disasters in some areas were still quite serious. Under the current conditions, some of these disasters are irresistible by human power, but as the responsible personnel of water conservancy work, we have a serious sense of responsibility. We must carefully examine our work, carefully summarize the experiences and lessons of each drought and flood disaster, and further grasp the characteristics of each region and the characteristics of the river, so as to improve and strengthen China's water conservancy construction. Although this year's flood has caused some difficulties to China's advancing construction cause, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, 600 million people have been united into a community with shared interests. Facts have proved that we have the strength to overcome this disaster. The people in the disaster-stricken areas have now been properly resettled; the production increase movement in the non-disaster areas and the production recovery work in the disaster areas are being carried out intensely; the Central People's Government has allocated sufficient funds for relief and work relief; and the water conservancy projects in the disaster-stricken areas will be repaired and strengthened soon. Such a government that cares about the lives of the people is unprecedented in Chinese history.

Participating in water conservancy work in the past five years has made me deeply feel that China's various construction undertakings, especially water conservancy undertakings, are not carried out in isolation by one department, but are developed under the joint action of many factors. First of all, under the people's democratic system, the unity of the country, the stability of social order, and the soaring of farmers' enthusiasm for production under the conditions of the successful completion of the land system reform and the gradual development of mutual assistance and cooperation are the basic conditions for the vigorous development of water conservancy. According to Chairman Mao's brilliant vision, the Central People's Government has made a large investment in water conservancy construction. In addition to the projects run by the masses themselves, which are handled according to the principle of more benefits and more burdens, and less benefits and less burdens, larger projects, including irrigation projects, are all invested by the state. Most of these projects are built to help farmers develop production, but farmers do not bear the cost of the projects, which is something that no capitalist country has. In addition, in many mass water conservancy works, such as the wide development of farmland water conservancy, the large-scale construction of river management projects, especially the struggle to defend against floods during the flood season every year, the organizational leadership of local party committees and people's governments has turned the power of millions of people into organized power, and the partial interests and the overall interests have been properly arranged. In the past five years, I have had the opportunity to travel to most parts of the country and met countless commissioners, county heads, and responsible personnel of local party committees. They have become one with the masses and are familiar with production and water conservancy conditions, which have deeply moved me. This network of cadres who are in contact with the broad masses and are proficient in production technology, the network of organizations, is the main backbone for the widespread development of China's water conservancy cause. Let me pay tribute to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao who led us to build such a country and train such cadres. Salute to the comrades who are doing rural work.

Participating in water conservancy work in the past five years has made me closer to the working people of our country. I understand their past pain, I see their joy today, and I also see their selfless labor on water conservancy projects. Therefore, I deeply understand that it is they who make the government's plans come true, it is they who make the strategies for water management come true, and it is they who turn the blueprints on paper into material Great Walls. As long as we think that the more than 2.9 billion cubic meters of earthwork done in water conservancy construction across the country in the past five years have been basically built up by millions of working people, one shovel after another, one basket after another, it is not difficult for us to appreciate how eager they are for our water conservancy projects, and how serious and important the responsibility of all our water conservancy workers is. Under such circumstances, we have no reason to be complacent. We must better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and from the years of accumulated experience of the working people, so that the technology from the working people can be returned to the people and benefit the people. Let me pay tribute to the working people across the country who are participating in water conservancy construction.

    治水五年
    全国人民代表大会代表
    水利部部长  傅作义
    五年来新中国各方面的建设，有许多生动的事实使我感动。在水利建设方面，因为我亲自参加，感觉得更加深切。
    我国劳动人民的创造力是伟大的。几千年前我们就修建过像都江堰、大运河那样巨大的水利工程，到现在还为人民所享用。但是由于封建社会的长期停滞，以及蒋介石国民党统治时期的严重破坏，使我国的水利建设没有得到发展。在一九四九年全国解放、中央人民政府成立的时候，全国的河道堤防多数处于残破失修的状态。比如淮河流域处于黄河浊流的蹂躏下达九年之久，但在黄河恢复故道以后，反动政府对淮河并没有进行治理。江南水稻地区的蓄水塘堰，也大部分遭受破坏。
    在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，水利事业是被看作发展工业农业生产的主要手段之一，是被看作全民生活中的一桩大事，人民革命刚取得胜利，水利建设事业便在全国范围内蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来了。
    五年来，国家兴办的防洪工程以及全国人民防汛的斗争，对于减轻洪水灾害起了重要的作用。黄河虽还没有进行根本的治理，可是从一九四七年黄河下游地区解放到现在的七年间，单靠堤防和防汛的措施，防御了几次较大洪水，没有发生严重的灾害。巨大的治淮工程，是一个包括二十八万平方公里的广大面积的流域治理工程。这个工程根据上、中、下游并重、蓄泄兼筹的方针，分两个步骤进行，第
  一步首先消除普通暴雨情况下的洪水和内涝灾害，第二步再消除非常洪水灾害并统筹开发水利。在今年特大洪水情况下，下游地区因为修了三河闸和灌溉总渠，加上上中游对于洪水的控制，基本上避免了淮河洪水的灾害，完全保障了苏北里下河区的农业生产。中游基本上保证了涡河以东淮北平原的安全，津浦路交通畅通，蚌埠、淮南等工业城市都得到了保障。上游在各水库和湖泊洼地蓄洪工程控制下，灾害也有所减轻。长江今年遭遇百年以来未有的大水，荆江大堤在荆江分洪工程的合理运用和十数万防汛人员的坚决防守下，胜利渡过五次险恶的洪峰。武汉市水位超过一九三一年最高水位达一点四五公尺，超过过去最高水位的时间持续达五十八天，百余公里的堤防，经过五期加高加固，水涨堤高，终于保障了武汉市安全。
    永定河的官厅水库，是永定河兴利除害的重要枢纽，将来配合下游防洪工程，就可完全解除永定河下游的水患。去年永定河曾发生有水文纪录以来第二位的大水，就没有发生灾害。东北的辽河在支流浑河上，开始修筑大伙房水库。在河流的疏浚方面，河北的潮白河开辟了新河道；大清河、子牙河下游开辟的独流减河，在今年保卫天津的斗争中，起
  了重要作用。华东沂河沭河的新河道，使这一地区十年连续的水患得以减轻。珠江三角洲，也修筑了许
  多联围筑闸的工程，对防洪排涝起着重要的作用。
      在河流治理的同时，农田水利工程也得到广泛
  的发展。五年来全国总计，整修和兴修渠道塘堰八
  百四十余万处，新凿水井九十余万眼，通过这些设施，除去改善灌溉的农田面积不计以外，总共增加灌溉面积六千一百余万亩。这个数字大约相当我国数千年来累积发展的水田面积的六分之一弱。
    通过水利建设的实践，和对苏联先进经验的学习，我国水利建设的技术也迅速提高。解放以前我国没有自己修建的大型水库，现在全国已经完成水库六处，另有三处正在动工，其中有土坝水库，也有高达七十多公尺的钢筋混凝土连拱坝水库。解放前没有做过较大的水闸，五年来我国所做的巨大水闸，如荆江分洪的进洪闸，全长一千零五十四公尺，淮河的三河闸高达九点五公尺，长达六百九十七公尺，都经过今年特大洪水的考验，操纵自如。此外在河道疏浚及水库闸坝工程方面，也在逐步推行着施工的机械化。我接触过许多生于旧中国的老工程师，每人都有着半生坎坷的经历。有些人遍读了中外水利科学的书籍，然而到须发斑白，在旧中国却找不到亲手修筑一个工程的机会。现在则到处在修筑工程，到处都需要技术人材，老年工程师到处受到尊敬，青年工程师每人都有远大的前途。所有学技术的人，都会证实我这种说法。
    我们的国家是一个地跨寒温热三带的大国，要想在短期内完全消灭水旱灾害，是不可能的事情。在今年特大暴雨下，江淮流域和河北省一部分地区遭受内涝和洪水灾害，经过各地人民的努力，虽有效地减轻了受灾的程度，但有些地区灾害仍是相当严重的。这些灾害在目前条件下，有些虽为人力所不可抗拒，但是作为水利工作的负责人员，我们却怀有严肃的责任感，我们要认真检查我们的工作，认真总结每一次水旱灾害当中的经验教训，进一步掌握各个地区的特点和河流性格，以改进和加强我国的水利建设。今年水灾虽给我国前进中的建设事业造成若干困难，但在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，六亿人民已经团结成一个休戚相关的整体，事实证明，我们有力量克服这种灾难。受灾地区的人民现已进行了妥善的安置；非灾区的增产运动和灾区的生产恢复工作，正在紧张地进行；中央人民政府并已拨出足够的经费进行救济和以工代赈；受灾地区的水利工程，即将修复加强。像这样关心人民生活的政府，是我国历史上前所未有的。
    五年来参加水利工作，使我深深地感觉到，我国的各种建设事业，特别是水利事业，并不是由一个部门孤立地进行的，而是在许多因素的共同作用下发展起来的。首先，在人民民主制度下，国家的统一，社会秩序的安定，在土地制度改革胜利完成和互助合作逐步发展的条件下，农民生产情绪的高涨，就是水利事业得以蓬勃发展的基本条件。根据毛主席英明的远见，中央人民政府对水利建设付出了大量的投资，除去群众自办的工程是按多受益的多负担、少受益的少负担的原则办理以外，较大工程包括灌溉工程，全部由国家投资。这些工程大部分是为了帮助农民发展生产而兴修的，农民却不负担工程的费用，这更是所有资本主义国家所没有的事情。此外，在许多群众性的水利工作上，如农田水利的广泛发展，江河治理工程的大规模施工，特别是每年汛期防御洪水的斗争，各地党委和人民政府的组织领导，使千百万人的力量变成有组织的力量，使局部利益同整体利益得到适当的安排。五年来，我有机会走遍全国大部地方，接触过无数的专员、县长和地方党委的负责人员，他们和群众打成
  一片，熟悉生产情况和水利情况，都使我深深受到感动。这一种联系广大群众、精通生产技术的干部的网，组织的网，就是我国水利事业广泛发展的主要骨干。让我向领导我们建成这样的国家、养成这样的干部的中国共产党和毛主席致敬。向千百万做农村工作的同志们致敬。
    五年来参加水利工作，使我更加亲近了我国的劳动人民。我了解了他们过去的痛苦，我看见了他们今日的欢欣，我也看见了他们在水利工程上的忘我的劳动。因而使我深切的了解到，是他们使政府的计划兑现，是他们使治水的方略兑现，是他们使纸上的蓝图变成了物质的长城。我们只要想到，全国五年来水利建设所做二十九亿多立方公尺的土工，基本上都是千百万劳动人民一锨接一锨、一筐赶一筐地筑起来的，我们就不难体会到，他们对于我们的水利工程，是怀抱着多么热切的希望，而我们全体水利工作人员的责任是如何严肃重大。在这种情况下，我们没有任何理由骄傲自满，我们必须更好地向苏联先进经验学习，向劳动人民多年累积的经验学习，使来自劳动人民的技术，再还给人民而为人民造福。让我向全国参加水利建设的劳动人民致敬。
