Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. The Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on October 6, 1954, at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting, the Korean-Chinese side notified the US side that the Korean-Chinese side would hand over to the US side two US military personnel and one aircraft that had violated the armistice agreement and entered the Korean-Chinese side's area of control on the afternoon of October 6.

The chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, notified the US side that: At about 4:15 pm on February 5, 1954, an unidentified aircraft entered the Korean-Chinese side's military control area and landed at Tuchengli Airport in the Kaesong area. According to the pilot of the aircraft, he was Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Peters of the United States Marine Corps, and he inadvertently entered the Korean-Chinese side's military control area because he lost his way while flying. At about 5:30 pm on May 25, 1954, an unidentified wounded soldier was found north of Shata-ri in the Korean-Chinese side's military control area. According to the soldier, he was Private First Class Charles Julius of the United States Army. He was sent by his superiors to the Korean-Chinese side's military control area to scout the Korean-Chinese side's infantry and artillery positions. He was injured by a landmine when he entered the Korean-Chinese side's military control area. After treatment by the Korean-Chinese side, he has now recovered. The Korean-Chinese side conducted a detailed investigation of the above-mentioned two personnel who had entered the Korean-Chinese side's area and confirmed that they were indeed US military personnel. Therefore, they were handed over to the US side at the Military Armistice Commission.

Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho also pointed out that the actions of the above-mentioned two persons in entering the Korean-Chinese side's military control area were in violation of the armistice agreement. Sending military personnel to enter the Korean-Chinese side's military control area for reconnaissance was an intentional violation of the armistice agreement. In this regard, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho brought this to the attention of the US side and requested the US side to take necessary measures in accordance with the armistice agreement.

At 3:00 pm on October 6, the Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission had handed over Lieutenant Colonel Peters and Private First Class Julius, together with the aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Peters, to the Secretary-General of the US side of the Military Armistice Commission.
