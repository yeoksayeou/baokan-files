    The film "Steel Transport Line," currently being shown in Beijing, is a documentary produced by the August First Film Studio. It provides a vivid and historical record of the arduous struggle on the transport lines during our War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. It comprehensively introduces the significance of "the transport line as the lifeline of modern warfare" and embodies the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's logistics transport units, railway troops, and Korean-Chinese railway workers, with the vigorous support of the Korean-Chinese people. The enemy carried out devastating bombing of our transportation lines, but our troops and people, fighting for justice, were not intimidated. Amidst the smoke of bombs and the blizzards of the winter of 1950, they displayed a high degree of revolutionary heroism, building bridges and roads, and working intensely.
    The film provides a true depiction of the highway and railway drivers who ensured supplies to the front lines, the soldiers who dismantled time bombs, the guards who hunted down airborne spies, and the engineering units who stubbornly repaired roads and steered ships, thus moving the audience.
    The "317" area, marked by the railway milestone, was originally one of the enemy's key areas for destruction. However, because we had strong anti-aircraft artillery units and brave Volunteer Army air force, enemy planes were shot down one after another, and our transportation vehicles traveled unimpeded. Thus, a steel transport line was established, ensuring supplies to the front and enabling our army to advance victoriously. The soldiers who undertook the glorious transportation task did their best to ensure that "wherever the troops fought, the ammunition would be delivered."
    Audiences will clearly appreciate on the screen how much heroic effort protected the growth of the steel transport line. From the east coast to the west coast, from the Yalu River to the front lines of the war, they traveled many dangerous and precarious roads under the rain of artillery fire to win victory and over fulfill the transportation tasks.
    This film progresses from our most difficult days to the later stages of the war, where we fought and grew stronger, and therefore is full of optimism, giving the audience great education and encouragement.

    影片“钢铁运输线”在京放映
    正在北京放映的“钢铁运输线”是解放军电影制片厂拍摄的一部纪录片，对我们抗美援朝战争中在运输线上所作的艰苦斗争作了形象的、历史性的纪录。它既全面地介绍了“运输线是现代化战争的输血管”的意义，又体现了中国人民志愿军后勤运输部队、铁道部队、朝中铁路员工们在朝中人民大力支援下所作的英勇斗争。敌人对我方的交通运输线进行毁灭性的轰炸，但是为正义而斗争的我方部队和人民没有被它吓倒，在炸弹的硝烟和一九五○年冬天的大风雪中发扬了高度的革命英雄主义精神，修桥筑路，紧张地劳动。
    影片中对保证了前方供应的公路、铁路司机、拆卸定时弹的战士、搜捕空降特务的警卫部队、顽强地修路驾船的工兵部队作了真实的描写，因而使观众受到感动。
    铁道里程标记的“三一七”地区原是敌人重点破坏地区之一，但是因为我方有了强大的高射炮部队和勇敢的志愿军空军，敌机一架架被打下来，我们的运输工具却畅行无阻，于是钢铁的运输线建立起来，确保了前方供应，使我军向胜利前进。担任光荣的运输任务的战士们竭力作到“部队打到那里，弹药送到那里。”
    观众们会从银幕上清晰地体会到：是多少英雄的心血保卫了钢铁运输线的成长，他们从东海岸到西海岸，从鸭绿江边到战争的前沿，在炮火纷飞下走过多少危急险要的路，才赢得了胜利，超额完成运输任务。
    这部影片从我方最困难的日子发展地拍到越战越强的战争后期，因此充满了乐观主义精神，给观众以极大的教育与鼓舞。
