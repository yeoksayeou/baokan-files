Correcting Partiality in Industrial Reporting
By our reporter, Angang

Some newspapers have a problem of partiality in their industrial reporting. This partiality is evident not only in criticism but also in praise.

I once heard a comrade at a construction site say: "A reporter from a certain newspaper once asked me: 'What are the main developments in your work recently?' I spent a long time telling him about some pressing problems in the construction work. I said, 'Please look into this and give us some help.' The reporter replied with an impatient and disappointed expression: 'Oh, these are just work problems. What I want to know is what new atmosphere there is. Tell me about the new atmosphere.' I said, 'New atmosphere? I'm sorry, I can't see it yet. Wait until we solve those problems and overcome the chaos, then come back and look for the "new atmosphere".'" According to this comrade, he wanted to avoid that reporter whenever he saw him after that, for fear that the reporter would ask for some "new atmosphere" again. Construction site life is full of new atmospheres, but it is completely different from the "new atmosphere" that reporter imagined. These new atmospheres in life are not static, isolated things. The struggle between the new and the old is the law of life. Applying this principle to reporting new atmospheres means that newspaper reporters should not reach out everywhere to ask for new atmospheres, but should discover new atmospheres from the perspective of supporting new things and opposing old and backward things. Otherwise, the new atmospheres that reporters interview may very well be superficial phenomena, or even illusions.

Partiality has various different manifestations: The first manifestation is parroting, not conducting independent investigation, thinking, and judgment, and believing whatever is picked up casually. According to the former "Liaodong Mass" newspaper's investigation, a reporter from that newspaper once simply looked at the factory's good news reports and overhaul summaries and found a few examples when reporting on the work of the Yingkou Paper Mill. Only after the article was published did they discover that the factory had worked overtime during the overhaul and had even had an accident. This situation is not isolated. When some reporters go to factories, they often don't go deep into the masses and into life to understand the production situation and problems, but rush to the factory at the end of the month or year to get the numbers for completing the plan and production good news reports. When factories launch technical innovation campaigns, reporters go to ask for materials on "tricks," "advanced experience," and "rationalization proposals." We are not against asking for materials, but if reporters are satisfied with the materials they get, blindly believe them, and write them into news reports without careful research, this approach is dangerous and such reporting is often partial.

The second manifestation of partiality is only looking at one side of the problem, and not observing and analyzing the problem comprehensively. A reporter from a newspaper wrote in a news report about supplying farmers with seeders to ensure spring plowing production that the efficiency of thread rolling machines was ninety times higher than using lathes to cut screws in the past. Later, it was discovered that the reporter only paid attention to the production efficiency of the thread rolling process, and did not include the man-hours consumed in the previous "roughing" process with a lathe, thus creating an exaggeration. That newspaper once reported that a worker at the Coal Industry Building Materials Company saved the country 3.6 billion yuan a year by using a wheelbarrow instead of carrying baskets. This was estimated by the author from the aspect of improving handling efficiency. Later, it was discovered that the company implemented piecework wages, with more work leading to more pay; handling efficiency increased, and wages also increased, so it was impossible to save 3.6 billion yuan a year. We often see news about completing national plans in the newspapers, many of which are truly completed, but many also only talk about the completed side (such as the output value plan) and do not mention the uncompleted side (such as the product variety plan, cost reduction plan, etc.). Why only look at one side? On the one hand, the "reporting good news, not bad news" mentality is at work, and on the other hand, there is insufficient understanding of the diversity and unity of modern industrial activities, grasping one point and ignoring others.

The third manifestation of partiality is cutting off history, opposing a thing to its subjective and objective conditions, instead of discovering problems and conducting reporting from the internal connections of things. Some people say: "Newspaper reporters are not writing history, they can only discuss things on their own merits." This is a bourgeois point of view of "reporting for the sake of reporting." The news reporter of the Party newspaper is not a recording tool, he is a Party worker. Therefore, he can only work according to the working principles of the Party. Even if he writes a small news item, he must make a comprehensive historical analysis with a spirit of responsibility to the Party. Only in this way can what he writes reflect Party spirit and authenticity. And only then can he not be blinded by temporary illusions. According to the Shenyang Daily's investigation, they once published the news "2192 Construction Site Launches Discussion of Ten-Day Construction Plan Among Workers" in a prominent position, introducing and promoting the construction site's practice of discussing plans. What was reported in the news was all facts, but the construction site's ten-day plan only lasted once and then disappeared, and at the same time, rework accidents occurred within that ten-day period. If one proceeds comprehensively from the internal connections of things, one should clarify the historical conditions of the construction site, the conditions for implementing the ten-day plan, and whether the conditions of management level, political work, and organizational work are compatible with this advanced work method, and then make a correct conclusion for reporting. Reporting in isolation will inevitably violate the objective laws of the development of things. For example, some newspapers once reported that certain factories were promoting the post economic accounting system. Soviet experts heard about it and said: "According to such reports, this factory has already entered communist society. Because these methods can only be achieved in communist society, when people have a high degree of communist consciousness." Our newspapers obviously only felt that this was a new method, and did not study its essence and the actual conditions of the factory, and published it rashly. These factories did not truly implement the post economic accounting system; even if some started to implement economic accounting, they could only develop step by step from the entire factory to the workshop and then to the team, otherwise they would commit the acute illness of violating the objective laws of the development of things. If the newspaper indiscriminately publicizes that the post economic accounting system has been promoted, it is precisely doing the captive of this "acute illness."

The fourth manifestation of partiality is flowery writing, "whatever you want, you get." As soon as a factory implemented the responsibility system, some newspapers immediately had news of "new atmospheres," as if the responsibility system was a panacea. It should be admitted that the implementation of the responsibility system will definitely overcome the chaotic phenomena, so it is entirely possible for a new atmosphere to appear, but we cannot proceed from "wishful thinking" when reporting. For example, some places did not do any preparatory work when implementing the responsibility system, and an order was passed down, and the responsibility system was to be established. This kind of responsibility system may also bring some new atmosphere to the work, but this kind of new atmosphere is temporary and not solid. The responsibility of newspaper reporters should be to face the reality of life with a critical eye, point out progressive phenomena, and also sound the alarm, instead of being deceived by some illusions. Our newspapers have extensively reported on the new atmosphere after the implementation of work plans, most of which are facts. But in many places, the author's pen exaggerated the facts. Implementing work plans is a necessary condition for enterprises to implement socialist production management, but this is not the only condition. In the implementation of work plans, many factories have neglected technical management, and work-in-progress has been reworked repeatedly, which has disrupted the work plans. Although the work plans of some factories can be 100% completed, the quotas and plans of the factories are very conservative, so it is possible to achieve balanced production effortlessly. The news reporters of the Party newspaper should face these situations squarely, properly estimate the achievements in the work, and conduct reporting with a realistic attitude. Reporters must resolutely abandon the idea of only looking at the work plan and not looking at life, looking up at the sky, "whatever you want, you get." If this idea is not abandoned, the reports they write will inevitably cause ideological confusion among the masses and affect the credibility of the Party newspaper.

It is also possible that some people kindly think: "Let's publicize new things more! There is no need to be demanding about the details." Under the control of this kind of thinking, some things are clearly still being tested, but the newspaper publicizes "already successful"; some things are basically successful in the test, but there are still problems, and the newspaper ignores its problems and goes straight to "reporting the victory." In fact, new things themselves have the power to mobilize. We report correctly and realistically and let the facts speak for themselves, which will definitely be able to convince people. Any contrary approach can only strangle new things. For example, a new creation is clearly not yet successful, but the newspaper says it is already successful. Some people in the factory see the publicity in the newspaper and become complacent: "Look, the newspaper has publicized it!" No longer continuing to study it. In this way, new things will stagnate in the torrent of life and die before they mature. Some people who resist new things will take out the newspaper and say sarcastic remarks: "This matter still has so many shortcomings, but the newspaper is bragging about its success." They spread an atmosphere of doubt and distrust among the masses, isolating new things. Some people see "success" in the newspaper and think they can promote it with their eyes closed. They find many problems in the promotion and become discouraged, saying: "It turns out it's unreliable, forget it." Obviously, the reporter's method of rendering success and exaggerating facts to support new things can only bring harm to the interests of the Party and the country.

So, why does the partiality of reporting arise?

The fundamental problem is that the thinking of some newspaper staff is still more or less influenced by bourgeois journalistic views. The main characteristic of bourgeois journalistic views is hypocrisy. People with this view will gradually or even completely become detached from the masses and practical life, and will treat the reality of life in a distorted way with erroneous views, thus running counter to the principle of authenticity in the Party's news work. The basic characteristic of the Party's propaganda and mobilization is that it is based on close contact with practical life and correct analysis of actual situations, so it is completely authentic. To achieve this, newspaper reporters must not avoid the urgent problems in life, not cover them up, and not be afraid to raise the problems sharply according to their original appearance. Only by loving life and caring about politics can we grasp and support new things from the struggle of life and correctly write out the new atmosphere that expresses various new things. At the same time, we can correctly support fresh and advanced things, and we will inevitably be able to expose and criticize backward and outdated things with the same seriousness; we can unify them ideologically, improve the ideological guidance of reporting, and make every report embody the socialist spirit of letting the advanced drive the backward forward.

Here, several erroneous ideas must be clarified.

Some people think: "It doesn't matter if the praise is a bit excessive, anyway, it is to complete the political task." But how can there be an overly praised manuscript that does not affect the completion of the political task or be criticized by people? The praise of our Party newspaper is a political positive force. It can politically encourage and mobilize the masses to complete the tasks assigned to them by the Party. The hypocritical and excessive praise cannot play this role at all. It can only harm the political influence of the Party and the Party newspaper.

Some people think: "There will be trouble if the criticism is sloppy, but people won't have any opinions if the praise is sloppy." But the purpose of our praise is to establish revolutionary examples, educate and lead the masses to advance together, not "praise for the sake of praise." A sloppy praise, like a sloppy criticism, will lose the Party's seriousness and combat effectiveness. This kind of praise deviates from the Party's correct principles and violates the truth of the facts, thus losing the role of educating and promoting the masses.

Some people think: "Praise is praise, criticism is criticism." When they want to praise a person or a thing, they only pay attention to the advantages, and sometimes even deliberately cover up the shortcomings; when they want to criticize this person or this thing, they only collect the shortcomings. This idea and practice is relatively popular. Of course, an article can be completely praising the advantages. The problem is that when praising, newspaper reporters should never put down the weapons of criticism and self-criticism. How can we correctly understand a person or a thing 100%? The method of listing or piling up advantages and disadvantages or the method of covering up advantages and disadvantages cannot solve this problem. We must learn to analyze and criticize comprehensively. Only by conducting full research from both the positive and negative aspects of things can we draw correct conclusions and thereby determine the appropriate degree of praise or criticism.

Some people think: "We are not familiar with industry, so it is difficult to avoid the error of partiality in reporting." But almost all partial reports are caused by not being humble, not going deep, and being complacent, and rarely caused by the difficulties of not being familiar with industry. The vast majority of partial errors in our newspapers are caused by suffering from an acute illness, underestimating the twists and turns and complexity of things, and replacing calm political analysis with a careless and blindly optimistic attitude. We do have difficulties in not being familiar with industrial production today, but precisely because we are not familiar with industry, we should be more humble and more cautious. As long as we are humble and thorough, we will definitely be able to prevent partiality.

The Party newspaper is the Party's political weapon. If newspaper reporters want to be worthy of the glorious title of Party newspaper worker, then they must eliminate the bourgeois influence in their thinking and style, replace partiality with the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, correctly analyze things in life in their work, and consciously combine the Party's policies with real life. The reporters who are currently doing industrial reporting are enthusiastically "drilling into production" and "experiencing life," which is a good phenomenon. But how can we become familiar with production and correctly experience life? This requires using the principles of Marxism-Leninism to examine every fact in real life, and not to replace policies with feelings. To achieve this, the most basic method is to strive to improve the level of theory and policy, closely combine theory and practice, go deep into life, and correctly and comprehensively analyze life phenomena. This is the basic condition for clearing partiality in the thinking of reporting and conducting correct reporting.

    纠正工业报道中的片面性
    本报记者　安岗
    有些报纸在工业报道中有一种片面性的毛病，这种片面性不仅表现在批评上，同样地也表现在表扬上。
    我曾听到某工地一位同志说：“有一个报社的记者曾经问我道：‘最近工作上有些什么主要情况？’我用了很长时间把工地工作中一些急待解决的问题告诉了他。我说：‘请你们研究一下，给我们一些帮助’。那位记者带着不耐烦的、失望的神情回答：‘啊，这是一些工作上的问题。我想要了解的是有什么新气象，你还是谈谈新气象吧’。我说：‘新气象吗？对不起，我现在还看不出来。等到我们把那些问题解决了，克服了混乱现象后，你再来找“新气象”吧。’”据这位同志说，从此他见了那位记者就想躲着，怕他再要什么“新气象”。工地生活中是充满着新气象的，但它同那个记者想像中的“新气象”完全不一样，生活中的这些新气象并不是什么静止的孤立的东西。新同旧的斗争是生活发展的规律，把这条原则应用到报道新气象上面来，就是说新闻记者不能到处伸手去要新气象，而要从支持新事物，反对旧的落后东西的斗争观点出发来发掘新气象。如若不然，记者采访的那些新气象，就很有可能是表面现象，甚至是假象。
    片面性有着各种不同的表现：第一种表现是人云亦云，不进行独立的调查、思考和判断，信手拈来，便信以为真。据前“辽东大众”报检查，该报一个记者有一次在报道营口造纸厂的工作时，只是看了一下该厂的捷报和检修总结，找了几个例子，就写了稿子。稿子发表后，才发现该厂在检修中加班加点，而且出了事故。这种情况不是个别的。有些记者下工厂，常常不是深入群众深入生活去了解生产情况和问题，而是赶到月底年底去工厂要完成计划的数字和生产捷报。工厂开展技术革新运动，记者就去要“窍门”、“先进经验”、“合理化建议”的材料。工厂搞劳动竞赛，记者就去要“先进人物”的材料。我们不反对要材料，但如果记者以拿到手的材料为满足，盲目相信，并且不经过认真研究，就写成新闻通讯，这种作法是危险的，这种报道也常常是片面的。
    片面性的第二种表现，是只看问题的一面，不去全面地观察和分析问题。有一个报纸的记者，在报道关于供应农民播种机保证春耕生产的一篇新闻中写道，滚丝机的效能比过去用车床来车螺丝的效率提高九十倍。后来才发现，这个记者只注意滚螺丝一道工序的生产效率，而没有把上一道经过车床“扒荒”的工序消耗的工时算在一起，因而造成夸大失实。这个报纸有一次报道了煤业建筑器材公司一个工人使用手推车代替抬筐，一年给国家节省三十六亿元的事例。这是作者从提高搬运效率这方面估计出来的。后来发现该公司实行的是以件计工，多劳多得；搬运效率提高了，工资也增加了，因而一年也就不可能节省三十六亿元。我们经常在报纸上看到完成国家计划的消息，其中有很多是真正完成了的，但也有不少的消息只说了完成的一面（如产值计划），而没有说出未完成的一面（如产品种类计划，降低成本计划等）。为什么只看一面呢？一方面是“报喜不报忧”的思想在作怪，另一方面也是对近代化工业活动的多样性和统一性认识不足，抓住一点，不顾其他。
    片面性的第三种表现是割断历史，把一件事同它的主客观条件对立起来，而不是从事物的内在联系中去发现问题进行报道。有人说：“新闻记者不是写历史，他只能就事论事”。这是一种“为报道而报道”的资产阶级观点。党报的新闻记者不是作为记录的工具，他是党的工作者。因此，他只能是按照党的工作原则去工作，即使写一条小消息，也要以对党负责的精神作全面的历史的分析，只有这样，他写出来的东西才能体现党性和真实性。也才能不被一时的假象所蒙蔽。据沈阳日报检查，他们曾在显著地位上发表了“二一九二工地发动职工讨论旬施工计划”的消息，介绍和推广了该工地讨论计划的作法。消息中所报道的本来都是事实，可是这个工地的旬计划仅仅实行了一次就烟消云散了，同时在这一旬内还发生了返工事故。如果全面地从事物的内在联系出发，就应该弄清楚该工地的历史条件，实行旬计划的条件，以及管理水平、政治工作和组织工作的条件是否与这种先进工作法相适应，然后再作出正确的结论进行报道。孤立地进行报道，又必然会违反事物发展的客观规律。譬如有的报纸曾经报道某些工厂推行岗位经济核算制，苏联专家听到了曾说：“按照这样的报道，这个工厂已走进共产主义社会了。因为这些办法只有到了共产主义社会，人们有了高度共产主义觉悟的时候才能作到”。我们的报纸显然只是觉得这是一种新鲜的办法，便不去研究它的实质和工厂的实际条件，就草率发表出去。这些工厂并没有真正实行岗位经济核算制；有的即使开始实行经济核算制，也只能是从全厂到车间、再到小组一步一步地发展，否则就要犯违反事物客观发展规律的急性病。如果报纸不加区别地宣传说推广了岗位经济核算制，正是做了这种“急性病”的俘虏。
    片面性的第四种表现是笔下生花，“要什么有什么”。工厂刚一实行责任制，有些报纸马上就有了“新气象”的新闻，好像责任制是一付万灵药丹一样。应当承认，实行责任制一定能够克服混乱现象，因此完全有可能出现新气象，可是我们报道时，却不能从“想当然”出发。譬如有些地方在实行责任制时没有作准备工作，一道命令传下去，就要建立责任制。这种责任制也可能使工作上出现一些新气象，但这种新气象是一时的，不巩固的。新闻记者的责任应当是用批判的眼光来正视生活的现实，指出进步的现象，同时也要敲起警钟，而不应被一些假象所迷惑。我们的报纸曾大量地报道实行作业计划后的新气象，其中绝大部分都是事实。但在很多地方，作者的笔却把事实夸大了。实行作业计划是企业实行社会主义生产管理的一个必要条件，但这并不是唯一的条件。在实行作业计划中，不少工厂忽视了技术管理，在制品一再返工，结果反而打乱了作业计划。有些工厂的作业计划虽然能够百分之百的完成，可是工厂的定额和计划却是十分保守，因而可以不费力气地作到均衡生产。党报的新闻记者就应当正视这些情况，恰当地估计工作中的成绩，并用实事求是的态度去进行报道。记者必须坚决抛弃那种不看生活只看工作计划，仰首望天，“要什么就有什么”的思想。不抛弃这种思想，他们写出来的报道，就必然会引起群众的思想混乱，影响党报的威信。
    也可能有人好心地想：“对新事物多鼓吹一下吧！细节问题不必苛求。”在这种思想支配下，有些东西明明还在试验，报纸就宣传“已经成功”；有些东西试验基本上虽然成功，但还有毛病，报纸就丢开它的毛病不管，迳自去“报捷”。其实，新事物本身就有鼓动的力量，我们正确地实事求是地进行报道，让事实去说话，就一定能够说服人，任何相反的作法，却只能绞杀新事物。譬如，一件新的创造明明还未成功，报纸上却说已经成功了，工厂的某些人看到报纸上的宣传，便自满起来：“你们看，报纸都给宣传了呢！”不再继续钻研。这样，新的东西在生活激流中就会停滞下来，没等到成熟就夭折了。一些抵抗新事物的人，又会拿出报纸来说风凉话：“这件事还有这么多的缺点，报纸上居然大吹大擂说什么成功了。”他们在群众中散布了怀疑和不信任的空气，使新事物孤立起来。有些人看到报上说是“成功”，便以为可以闭着眼睛去推广，在推广中发现问题很多，便泄了气，说：“原来是靠不住的，算了吧。”显而易见，记者用渲染成功和夸大事实的方法来支持新事物，只能给党和国家的利益带来损害。
    那么，为什么会产生报道的片面性呢？
    根本的问题是有些报纸工作人员的思想中，还或多或少地受了资产阶级新闻观点的影响。资产阶级新闻观点的主要特点是虚伪。有了这种观点的人，同人民群众和实际生活就会逐渐以至完全脱节，就会用错误的观点歪曲地对待生活现实，这样就与党的新闻工作的真实性原则背道而驰。党的宣传鼓动的基本特点，是以密切联系实际生活和正确分析实际情况为前提，因而它是完全真实的。要作到这一点，新闻记者必须不回避生活中的迫切问题，不掩盖它们，不害怕按照它的本来面貌把问题尖锐地提出。只有这样热爱生活、关心政治，我们才能从生活斗争中来把握和支持新事物，并正确地写出表现各种新事物的新气象。同时，我们能够正确地支持新鲜的、先进的事物，也就必然能够同样严肃地暴露和批判落后的、陈旧的东西；我们从思想上把它们统一起来，就可以提高报道的思想指导作用，使每一篇报道都体现出让先进带动落后前进的社会主义的精神。
    这里，有几种错误思想必须加以澄清。
    有人认为：“表扬得过火点没有关系，反正是为了完成政治任务。”可是，哪会有一种表扬过分的稿件，不影响政治任务的完成，不受到人们的指责呢？我们党报的表扬是政治上的积极力量，它能够从政治上鼓舞和动员群众完成党所交给他们的任务。而虚伪的过分的表扬却丝毫起不了这种作用，它只能损害党和党报的政治影响。
    有人认为：“批评马虎一点会有麻烦，表扬马虎一点人家不会有什么意见。”但是我们表扬的目的是为了树立革命的榜样，教育和带动群众一齐前进，不是“为表扬而表扬”。马虎一点的表扬，就像马虎一点的批评一样，都会失去党的严肃性和战斗性。这种表扬离开了党的正确原则，违反事实的真实，因而也就失去了教育和推动群众的作用。
    有人认为：“表扬是表扬，批评就是批评”。他们要表扬一个人或一件事时，就只注意优点，有时甚至有意地把缺点掩盖起来；等到要批判这个人或这件事时，就只搜集缺点。这种思想和作法是比较流行的。当然，一篇文章可以是完全表扬优点的。问题是在表扬时，新闻记者永远不要放下批评和自我批评的武器。怎样才能百分之百地正确地了解一个人或一件事呢？用罗列或堆积优缺点的办法或是用掩盖优缺点的办法，都是不能解决这个问题的。必须学会全面地进行分析和批判，只有从事物的正反两方面进行充分的研究，才能得出正确的结论，并由此来确定表扬或批评的恰当分寸。
    有人认为：“我们对工业不熟悉，因而在报道中很难避免片面性的错误”。可是几乎所有片面性的报道，都是由于不虚心、不深入、自满而造成的，很少是因为不熟悉工业的困难造成的。我们报纸上出现的绝大多数的片面性错误，都是因为害了急性病，过低地估计了事物的曲折性和复杂性，用漫不经心、盲目乐观的情绪代替了冷静的政治分析的结果。我们今天确有不熟悉工业生产的困难，但正因为我们对工业不熟悉，我们就应当更加虚心、更加谨慎，只要虚心和深入，我们就一定能够防止片面性。
    党报是党的政治武器。新闻记者要使自己无愧于党报工作者的光荣称号，那就必须肃清思想中和作风中的资产阶级的影响，用马克思列宁主义的观点来代替片面性，在工作中正确地分析生活中的事物，自觉地把党的政策同现实生活结合起来。现在作工业报道的记者，都在热心地“钻生产”、“体验生活”，这是好的现象。但是怎样才能熟悉生产并且能正确地体验生活呢？这就必须用马克思列宁主义的原则来检验实际生活中的每一个事实，而不要以感想代替政策。要作到这一点，最基本的办法是努力提高理论水平和政策水平，把理论和实践紧密结合起来，深入生活，正确地全面地分析生活现象。这是清除报道思想中的片面性，进行正确报道的基本条件。
