Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, October 29th: The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published an editorial on the 28th entitled "The Vietnamese People Do Not Recognize the U.S. Consulate General in Hanoi."

The editorial first stated: After the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Army liberated Hanoi, the U.S. government continued to maintain its consulate general in Hanoi. On October 23, 1954, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department announced that since the Geneva Accords did not stipulate the establishment of a new government, the U.S. Consulate General would continue to perform its functions and be responsible for protecting American journalists.

The editorial believes that this behavior of the U.S. imperialists is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords and international law. Article 14 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam clearly stipulates that, pending the general election for the unification of Vietnam, the area north of the provisional military demarcation line shall be governed by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The U.S. State Department openly denies this.

The editorial pointed out that, according to international law, no country has the right to establish a consulate in another country without the permission of the government of that country and unless the two countries have established relations. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the U.S. government have no diplomatic relations; furthermore, the United States has not obtained the permission of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, yet the United States continues to maintain its consulate in Hanoi. Therefore, the U.S. government has violated the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and disregarded world opinion. The fact that they openly maintain their consulate general in Hanoi is merely part of their shameless policy of intervention.

The editorial stated that we, on behalf of the workers and people of Vietnam, fully support the strong statement of the Hanoi Military and Administrative Committee regarding the non-recognition of the U.S. Consulate General in Hanoi. At the same time, the editorial stated that the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are determined to protect the lives and property of all foreigners, as long as the latter respect the laws of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, on the other hand, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are also determined to oppose any act by the imperialists that infringes upon the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    越南人民不承认美国驻河内的总领事馆——越南“人民报”社论的摘要
    【新华社二十九日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十九日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”二十八日以“越南人民不承认美国驻河内的总领事馆”为题发表社论。
    社论首先揭述：在越南民主共和国政府和人民军光复河内以后，美国政府继续维持它在河内的总领事馆。一九五四年十月二十三日，美国国务院发言人又宣布说，由于日内瓦协定并没有规定建立新政府，因此美国总领事馆将继续执行职权，并负责保护美国新闻记者。
    社论认为：美帝国主义者的这种行为是严重违反了日内瓦协定和国际法。越南停止敌对行动协定的第十四条清楚地规定，在等待举行统一越南的普选期间，位于临时军事分界线以北的地区由越南民主共和国政府负责管辖。美国国务院竟公然否认了这一点。
    社论指出：根据国际法，任何国家都无权在另一个国家设立领事馆，如果未经这个国家的政府的许可和如果两国没有建立关系的话。越南民主共和国政府和美国政府没有外交关系；此外，美国也没有得到越南民主共和国政府的许可，然而，美国却继续在河内维持它的领事馆。因此，美国政府已侵犯了越南民主共和国的主权，并且不理会世界舆论。他们公然在河内维持他们的总领事馆这一事实不过是他们无耻的干涉政策的一部分罢了。
    社论说明：我们代表越南工人和人民完全支持河内军政委员会关于不承认河内美国总领事馆的有力的声明。同时，社论表明：越南民主共和国政府和人民决心保护一切外侨的生命和财产，只要后者尊重越南民主共和国政府的法律。但是，另一方面，越南民主共和国政府和人民也坚决反对帝国主义者侵犯越南民主共和国主权的任何行为。（附图片）上图：十月十日，越南人民军举行河内入城式，河内市民热情地把鲜花献给前进的战士们。下图：河内市民围着宣传广播车听广播。（新华社记者　戴　煌摄）
