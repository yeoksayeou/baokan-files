Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 23rd: The memorial pavilion built by the Korean people to commemorate Martyr Wang Yongwei has been completed in early October.

    The memorial pavilion was built at the head of Dongping Village, Tieshan County, where Martyr Wang Yongwei sacrificed himself to save others. The pavilion is surrounded by bluestone slabs, and a neat platform is built in front of the pavilion with bluestone. An oil portrait of Wang Yongwei hangs in the memorial pavilion. The local Korean people named this memorial pavilion "Wang Yongwei Pavilion".

    After the completion of the memorial pavilion, representatives from the Party and government organs of Tieshan County, Pingan North Province, representatives from the political organs of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and 500 local Korean people held an unveiling ceremony in front of the pavilion. Song Genyu, the grandson of Song Dongshi, the Korean mother whom Martyr Wang Yongwei rescued at the cost of his life, presented a wreath to the martyr's tomb to pay his respects.

    Wang Yongwei was a first-class meritorious worker, a second-class model of cherishing the people, and a model member of the Communist Youth League of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. On the evening of November 20, 1952, he rushed into the thick smoke and fire caused by the enemy plane bombing, rescued a wounded soldier of the People's Army, and rescued four packages of grain from a Korean villager. When he finally carried a 73-year-old Korean woman, Song Dongshi, out of the fire and reached the door, he was unfortunately hit by a heavy bomb dropped by an enemy plane and died heroically on the spot. His great internationalist spirit will forever live in the hearts of the Korean people. In the past two years, the people of Tieshan County have gone to Martyr Wang Yongwei's tomb to pay their respects on every festival. The students of Dongping Village People's School (primary school) clean the martyr's tomb once a week. An amateur troupe in Tieshan County adapted the deeds of Martyr Wang Yongwei into a dance drama and toured around to perform it.

    朝鲜人民修建的“王永维阁”在十月初落成
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜人民为纪念王永维烈士而修建的纪念亭，已在十月初落成。
    纪念亭修建在王永维烈士舍身救人的铁山郡东平里村头。亭子的周围竖立着青石板，亭前用蓝石块砌着整齐的平台，纪念亭上挂着王永维油画像。当地朝鲜人民把这座纪念亭命名为“王永维阁”。
    纪念亭落成后，平安北道铁山郡党、政机关和中国人民志愿军某部政治机关代表及当地朝鲜人民五百多人在亭前举行了揭幕典礼。王永维烈士生前
  舍身抢救的朝鲜母亲——宋东氏的孙子宋根玉向烈
  士墓献花圈致敬。
    王永维是中国人民志愿军某部一等功臣、二级爱民模范和模范青年团员。一九五二年十一月二十日晚上，他冲进被敌机轰炸而燃起的浓烟烈火中，抢救出一个人民军伤员，又抢救出朝鲜老乡的四包粮食，当他最后从烈火中背着一位七十三岁的朝鲜老大娘宋东氏冲到门口时，不幸被敌机投下的一颗重磅炸弹击中，当场光荣牺牲。他的伟大的国际主义精神，永远活在朝鲜人民的心里。近两年来铁山郡人民每逢节日都到王永维烈士墓前祭奠。东平里人民学校（小学）的学生们，每周都给烈士打扫一次墓地。铁山郡某业余剧团，把王永维烈士生前的事迹编成了舞剧，到各处巡回演出。
