The Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition features many prints, including lithographs, linocuts, metal engravings, woodcuts, paper prints, and illustrations, all of which are works of high achievement.

The exhibited lithographs are all self-printed by the artists. They possess full painting capabilities, especially drawing capabilities, and can fully express various subjects with elegant and unique interests. Gai. Xie. Weilei's "Kukryniksy Collective Portrait" uses extremely skilled techniques and rapid, bold brushstrokes to depict the friendly cooperation of these three painters. His "Academician I.A. Olberri Portrait" shows the thinker concentrating, working tirelessly, and about to achieve success. Another outstanding work is Yu. Mi. Nieplincev's "Surgeon Vinogradov During Surgery," depicting the experienced doctor calmly facing a serious surgical task, about to use all his energy to save the patient's life. His print portrays the beautiful image of this noble revolutionary humanitarian. These portraits are so successful that they are not superficial portraits but create a thoughtful effect. Similarly, Ye. Yi. Charushin's self-printed color and monochrome lithographs of "Little Tiger" and "Little Bear" show the various adorable images of small animals being naughty, noisy, crying, and picking food. These paintings are connected to stories and serve as children's reading materials, and it is expected that they will have a wonderful infectious effect on children's hearts. These paintings are good friends of children. Ye. A. Kibrik's illustrations for "Taras Bulba" and the opening painting for "Brave Warriors" are both very simple color lithographs. The former uses a close-up composition to depict the mighty power of this Cossack hero fighting for Russia, while the latter adapts to the content of the ballad narrative poem with rich imagination, prominently depicting this Russian strongman with infinite power.

Due to its performance and characteristics of the engraving process,胶版画 (jiāo bǎn huà - gelatine prints), are easy to express strong light and dark and color effects, and have upright and rounded knife flavors. I.A. Sokolov's "Famous Steelmaking Veteran Sveshnikov" and other works fully utilize this feature to show the intense machine production and strong firelight in socialist labor. It is a beautiful and dazzling print. Pi. Yi. Vaniev's "Valley of Narzan Mineral Springs" is a lyrical work that places people in a beautiful realm. In the valley full of sunshine, there are two strong mountain goats on the peak. When they discover a person riding livestock along the white river in the deep valley, the larger mountain goat stands with its head held high, showing unfamiliarity and fear. The other smaller mountain goat has already begun to run towards the place where it can hide. However, the rider did not notice these two panicked mountain goats. The use of black and white on the screen is very clever and concise, and the layers of mountains are full of changes, and the knife marks are as solid as an axe. Wei. Xie. Bibikov's "Coastal Area of the Soviet Union" uses delicate engraving methods to play the beautiful scenery of a bright and vast seaside. Zhuo. Ni. Vanieva's "Mimosa" reveals a bright and soft feeling under the engraving knife, expressing the life of the flower.

Metal engravings are mostly sets of paintings and are all landscape paintings. Ni. Ge. Nikiforov's "Majestic Ural" print set is the work with the most pieces in this exhibition. They are all etching copperplate engravings composed of precise lines, but each piece has a different charm due to the different objects being depicted. Some depict dense forests, some depict valleys and rivers in the forests, and some depict those soft small trees, or boats traveling on the quiet river. These beautiful and magnificent landscapes make us feel the richness of the Soviet Union. The natural scenery expressed through the works gives people a strong infection. This infection is connected with real life, which makes people love nature and life.

There are also many other single-piece prints on display. Ya. Ya. Deneka's "Tanks Advance to the Front" uses vigorous brushstrokes and simple colors to depict tanks traveling in the wind and snow, so that we seem to still be able to breathe the tense atmosphere of the Soviet Patriotic War. You. Yi. Pimenov's "Fir Tree in the Snow" shows the fir tree's character of being cold-resistant and unfading. Behind it, a team of transport vehicles is driving on a road covered with deep snow. This is a landscape painting, and it also expresses the spirit of socialist builders who are not afraid of difficulties. Fl. An. Favorsky's woodcut print "Illustration of Igor's Expedition" maintains his consistent style, using beautiful, delicate, and regular knife techniques to engrave a unique charm in these very small paintings. I. Mo. Taoijie's large-scale steel pen drawing "Tiger Skin Knight" long poem illustration is a work with majestic momentum and unique national characteristics. The famous printmaker Ni. Ni. Zhukov's pencil drawing "Who of you will play the cat and mouse game?" This is a vivid and meaningful work, expressing the kind and loving spirit of the great Lenin towards children and the various lively states of children under the spiritual inspiration of Lenin. It has a great power of temptation that makes people happy and makes people feel more and more interesting. The printmaker Finogenov, who visited China a long time ago, used many sets of paintings to reflect the historical events of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. This exhibition showed two single-piece paper prints, one depicting the scene of the border region people rising up against aggression under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the other depicting the scene of land reform, which makes us feel particularly kind. Wei. Xie. Klimashin, this master of watercolor painting, is good at using moisture. In the specific images of his "Song of Defending Peace" and "Daughter of the Dockworker" and other works, we see the life and wishes of the Indian people. Bo. Yi. Prolokov's two large "Americans, Get Out!" and "Weapons Replace Butter" in the ink painting series "Americans in Europe" expose the conspiracy of American imperialism to try to drag mankind into war disasters, and also reflect the poverty and anger of the American people under the war policy of the American rulers. Another painting reflects the struggle of peace-loving people all over the world to defend world peace. The technique is very concise, and the solemn image of peace-loving people is summarized in a close-up manner, containing an internal and huge power. These sets of paintings have a unique style and have the agitation of posters. In these works, the painter did not use many colors, but expressed the lofty aspirations of people striving for peace and happiness with strong ink effects.

In this exhibition of prints, there are also many book illustrations. Such as Kukryniksy's ink illustrations of "Mother" and "Overcoat", De. A. Shmarinov's illustrations of "The Artamonov Family", Xie. Hua. Gerasimov's illustrations of "The Big Thunderstorm", O. Gai. Weilei's ink painting illustrations of "Quiet Don", Da. Ya. Dubinsky's ink illustrations of "Chuck and Geck", and A. Yi. Reznichenko's paper print illustrations of "How Steel Was Tempered" are all bright and beautiful works with different styles. These illustrations truthfully depict the characters and plots in the book, enriching the content of literary works.

Soviet prints were introduced to China by Mr. Lu Xun, which had a historical and huge impact on Chinese new woodcuts. Chinese woodcuts also emerged and became a revolutionary weapon for disseminating advanced ideas. In the past two or three decades, Chinese prints have also had many exchanges with Soviet prints.

Soviet prints are developing rapidly along the creative path of socialist realism. From this, we can see the brilliant achievements of Soviet printmakers in opposing the influence of bourgeois formalism. The profound content and colorful style of Soviet prints are based on people's lives and people's love. The brilliant, great achievements and experiences of Soviet printmaking are what our printmakers must learn.

    苏联版画创作的光辉成就
  　彦涵
    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会展出的美术作品中，有不少版画，包括有石版、麻胶、金属、木刻、纸版等各种版画和插图，都是成就很高的作品。
    展出的石版画，都是画家自印的，它们具有充分的绘画性能，特别是素描的性能，能够充分表现各种不同的题材，具有优美、独特的风趣。盖·谢·魏列依斯基所作“库克雷尼克塞合像”，以极熟练的技巧，急速而豪迈的笔法，画出了这三位画家友好合作的神情。他的“依·阿·奥尔伯里院士像”，表现出了思想家聚精会神、钻研不懈和将要获得成功结果的神态。另一杰出的作品，是尤·米·聂普林切夫作的“临施手术时的外科医生维诺格拉多夫”的肖像画，画出这位有经验的医生沉着地去迎接一个严重的手术任务。将要用他全部的精力，去挽救病者的生命。在他的这幅版画中刻划了这位高贵的革命人道主义者的美丽的形象。这些肖像都是达到了这样成功的地步，它们不是那种流于表面肤浅的画像，而从肖像画的本身产生一种导致人们深思的作用。同是自印的叶·依·查鲁申的“小老虎”“小熊”等的彩色和单色的石版画，表现了小动物的顽皮、吵闹、号叫和采摘食物时的各种可爱的形象，这些画是和故事相连，作为儿童读物的，可以料到它们对孩子的心灵会发生美好的感染作用，这些画，都是孩子们的良友。叶·阿·基布里克的“达拉斯·布尔巴”插图和“壮士”的卷首画，都是非常素雅的套色石版画，前者用特写式的构图刻划出了为俄罗斯而战的这位哥萨克英雄的那种磅礴的力量，后者则是适应着民谣叙事诗的内容贯串着丰富的想像，突出地描写了这个拥有无穷力量的俄罗斯壮士。
    胶版画，由于它的性能和刻制过程的特点，易于表现强烈的明暗和色彩效果，并有挺拔圆浑的刀味。依·阿·索科洛夫作的“有名的炼钢老手斯维什尼科夫”等作品，都是充分利用这一特点，表现出社会主义劳动中紧张的机器生产和强烈的火光，是漂亮夺目的版画。彼·依·华聂也夫作的
  “纳尔赞矿泉的山谷”，是一幅置人于美丽境界的抒情的作品。充满着阳光的山谷里，峰顶上有两只健壮的山羊，当它们发现了沿着深谷中白色的小河，来了一个骑着牲口的人，那一只较大的山羊，昂首站立在那里，显出生疏和惊恐，另一只较小的山羊，早已开始向那可以隐避的地方跑去。可是那位骑者并没有发现这两只惊惶失措的山羊。画面上黑白的运用，很巧妙而精练，层层山色，富有变化，刀痕如斧凿般的坚实。维·谢·毕必科夫作的“苏联的沿海边区”，采用纤细的刻法，奏出明朗广阔的海滨的美景。卓·尼·华聂也娃的“含羞草”，在刻刀下流露出鲜明而柔和的感觉，表现出花的生命。
    金属版画大多是组画而且全部是风景画。尼·格·尼基佛罗夫的“雄壮的乌拉尔”版印组画，是这次展品中幅数最多的作品，都是以精密的线条组成的腐蚀铜版画，但是每幅都是因描写对象的不同而情趣也不一样的，有的描画茂密的森林，有的描画着森林中的山谷与河流，有的描画着那些柔美的小树，或者是静静河水上的行舟。这些优美壮丽的风景，使我们感到苏联的富饶，通过作品所表现的自然景色，给予人们很强的感染，这种感染，和现实的生活相联系，令人发生对自然对生活的热爱。
    展出的还有其他不少独幅版画。亚·亚·德涅卡的“坦克开往前线”，以苍劲的笔法和单纯的色彩，描写在风雪中行进的坦克，使我们似乎还能呼吸到当年苏联卫国战争的紧张气氛。尤·依·皮门诺夫的“雪中的枞树”，表现出枞树耐寒不凋的性格，在它的背后，有一队运输汽车行驶在积雪深厚的马路上。这是一幅风景画，也表现了建设社会主义的人们不畏艰困的奋斗精神。弗·安·法沃尔斯基的木刻版画“伊哥尔兵团出征记”插图，保持他那一贯的作风，运用优美的纤细的有规律的刀法，在这些很小的画幅中，刻出独特的风趣。依·莫·陶依杰的大幅钢笔画“虎皮骑士”的长诗插图，是具有雄厚气魄和独特的民族色彩的作品。著名版画家尼·尼·茹科夫的铅笔画“——你们有谁会作猫捉老鼠游戏？”这是一幅形象鲜明，具有生活意味的作品，表现出了伟大列宁对于孩子们那种慈爱的精神面貌和孩子们在列宁精神感召下的各种活泼的状态，具有令人喜悦的极大诱惑的力量，使人越看越有味道。很早以前访问过中国的版画家费诺根诺夫，曾用很多篇幅的组画反映中国人民革命斗争的历史事件，这次展出了其中的两张独幅的纸版画，一张是刻划在抗日战争中，边区人民在毛主席领导下奋起反对侵略的情景，另一张是描绘土地改革的场面，令我们特别感到亲切。维·谢·克里马申这位水彩画的能手，善于运用水分，在他的“保卫和平之歌”“码头工人的女儿”等作品的具体的形象上，使我们看出了印度人民的生活和愿望。波·依·普罗洛科夫作的“美国人在欧洲”水墨组画中的两个大幅“美国佬，滚蛋吧！”“武器代替了黄油”，揭露了美帝国主义企图把人类卷进战争灾害中的阴谋，同时也反映了美国人民在美国统治者战争政策下的贫困与愤怒。另一幅反映全世界爱和平人民为保卫世界和平所进行的斗争。技法很精练，特写式地概括了爱和平人民的庄严的形象，蕴蓄着内在的巨大的力量，这些组画独具风格，带有招贴画的鼓动性。这些作品，画家并没有采用很多的色彩，可是以强烈的水墨效果，表达了人们争取和平和幸福的崇高愿望。
    在这次展出的版画中，更有很多书籍插图。如库克雷尼克塞作的“母亲”“外套”的水墨插图，德·阿·施马里诺夫所画的“阿尔达莫诺夫家事”的插图，谢·华·格拉西莫夫的“大雷雨”的插图，奥·盖·魏列依斯基水墨画的“静静的顿河”插图，达·亚·杜宾斯基用水墨作成的“楚克和盖克”的插图，以及阿·依·列兹尼青科作的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”纸版画插图，都是明洁而又不同风趣的佳作。这些插图真实地刻划出书中的人物和情节，丰富了文学著作的内容。
    苏联的版画，经过鲁迅先生介绍到中国来，对于中国新的木刻发生了历史性的巨大影响。中国木刻也就新兴起来，从此成为传播先进思想的革命武器。近二三十年来，中国版画也因而和苏联版画有了多次交流。
    苏联版画正循着社会主义现实主义的创作道路日益发展着，从这里可以看出苏联版画家们反对资产阶级形式主义影响的光辉成就。苏联版画的深刻内容和多采的风格，都是以人民生活和人民喜爱为基础的。苏联版画这种光辉的巨大的成就和经验，是我国版画家们必须学习的。
