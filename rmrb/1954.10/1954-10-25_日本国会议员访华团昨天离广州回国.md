	Japanese Diet Members' Delegation
	We, the delegation of representatives from various parties of the Japanese Diet, are very pleased to have been invited by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, who worked tirelessly to receive us with warmth, to participate in the National Day celebrations and then to visit various places for a month, and to have been able to have cordial and in-depth conversations with people from all walks of life, led by Premier Zhou Enlai. We would like to express our deep gratitude here.
	Through these visits and talks, we have practically experienced that your people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, are actively engaged in socialist construction and are particularly eager to establish friendly relations with Japan to safeguard world peace, which makes us very happy.
	For the sake of peace in Asia and the world, promoting friendship between Japan and China and adjusting the relations between the two countries as soon as possible is our wish and the main intention of this visit to your country. Your country, through Premier Zhou, has kindly and concretely expressed to us the sincerity of adjusting diplomatic relations. To this, we are willing to work for its realization.
	As we leave your country, we once again express our deep gratitude to you and wish your country new construction success and all the leaders and people good health.

      向中国告别
    日本国会议员各党代表团
    我们日本国会议员各党代表团，在中国人民外交学会废寝忘食地热情招待之下，参加了国庆节观礼；其后又到各地参观，历时一个月，并得以同周恩来总理为首的各界人士亲切地促膝畅谈，感到非常高兴。我们在此深表谢意。
    通过这些参观和会谈，我们实际地体验到贵国人民在毛主席领导下正在积极进行着社会主义的建设，并为了保卫世界和平而特别热望同日本建立友好关系，使我们不胜欣喜。
    为了亚洲和世界的和平，促进日中两国的友好，尽速调整两国国交，乃是我们的愿望，也是这次访问贵国的主要的意图。贵国通过周总理亲切地具体地向我们表明了调整国交的诚意，对此，我们也愿为其实现而努力。
