    Soviet Cultural Delegation Leader and Others Express Impressions of China Visit
    Denisov
    【Xinhua News Agency, October 29th】 Professor Denisov, head of the Soviet Cultural Delegation and Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, published his impressions of his visit to China on October 29th. The full text is as follows:
    The Soviet Cultural Delegation, invited by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, has had the opportunity over the past month, in the capital of the People's Republic of China, Beijing, as well as in major economic and cultural centers, to meet with political and social activists, figures in science, national education, and the arts, and with workers, staff, collective farm peasants, and cooperative members. Our Chinese friends were happy to provide us with corresponding answers to all the questions raised by our delegation—which were not few and covered various aspects of national life. The members of the Soviet Cultural Delegation were pleased to report and lecture on the life of the Soviet people, as requested by our Chinese comrades, and answered the various questions they raised.
    In all the cities and villages visited by the delegation, the remarkable achievements and victories of the working people were visible. In understanding the life of the Chinese people, the delegation was very pleased to see the great consolidation of the people's democratic system over the past five years, the establishment of the people's regime led by the working class, and the foundation of truly democratic laws. All the achievements of the hardworking and intelligent people—the establishment of socialist components in the national economy, the construction of new and the transformation of old industrial enterprises, the significant upsurge in national education, national public health, literature and art, the significant improvement in the living standards of the masses, etc.—have been legally expressed and confirmed in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which was adopted at the end of September this year.
    The organized, political and labor enthusiasm of the workers in the cities and villages of People's China gave the delegation a powerful and indelible impression. The advanced forces of Chinese society have universally formed a broad front and are moving forward. They are fighting for a great cause, the victory of which will transform China into a great socialist power. The general line for the transition period formulated by the Communist Party of China has become the direction for the advance of the people of the whole country. There are many difficulties on the road to building socialism, but the builders of socialism are able to discover these difficulties and know how to fight against them, and they are full of confidence in overcoming these difficulties.
    The Soviet Cultural Delegation was very pleased to see the growing friendship of the Chinese people towards the Soviet people, and the fervent desire of intellectuals and manual workers to further consolidate the friendship and strengthen cultural cooperation between the people of the two great countries—China and the Soviet Union—with their own contributions.
    Our delegation expresses its gratitude and thanks to the many Chinese friends and comrades, and the delegates unanimously cheered:
    Long live the great friendship and comprehensive fraternal cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people!
    Petrovsky
    【Xinhua News Agency, October 29th】 Academician Petrovsky, a member of the Soviet Cultural Delegation and President of Moscow State University, published his impressions of his visit to China on the 26th. The full text is as follows:
    Visiting many Chinese institutions of higher learning has left me with unforgettable impressions. Everywhere I saw enthusiastic, talented, and hard-working students. I met many professors and teachers who dedicated all their strength to teaching, which made me very happy. Everywhere I saw the great concern of the government of the People's Republic of China for the development of higher education. Many of the institutions of higher learning I visited are building new buildings and equipping new laboratories.
    I sincerely congratulate Chinese universities and colleges on their great achievements in training highly skilled specialists who are infinitely loyal to the motherland and to China's socialist construction.
    Soviet scientists are very happy about every new achievement made by People's China in cultural construction and national economic construction. We regard this achievement as the achievement of all progressive mankind and the achievement of peace.
    May the friendly ties between Chinese and Soviet scientists be strengthened day by day!
    Ventslova
    【Xinhua News Agency】 Ventslova, a member of the Soviet Cultural Delegation, a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Writers' Union, and Chairman of the Council of the Writers' Union of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, published his impressions of his visit to China on the 27th. The full text is as follows:
    I will never forget October 1954, when I spent it in the People's Republic of China as a member of the Soviet Cultural Delegation. During this month, we saw many pleasing and unforgettable new things: the national celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the grand National Day celebration held in Huairen Hall, and the parade of people rejoicing in victory in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. It was so united, beautiful, and vibrant... The great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, the leaders of the government of the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet government delegation headed by Khrushchev stood together on the rostrum.
    We saw Shenyang, the giant Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the Fushun coal mine with our own eyes; the mausoleum of the great Chinese democrat, Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing; the prosperous streets of free Shanghai, boiling with happy life; the beautiful West Lake in Hangzhou with its clear water reflecting the sky and autumn waves; and the streets of Guangdong in hot southern China; the Yangtze River flood control embankment in Wuhan; the great heroic labor of the free people, whose power and genius are admirable and make us proud. Wherever we went, we saw people engaged in enthusiastic labor and creation.
    I will never forget the meetings with Chinese writers and artists in many cities of People's China.
    I was deeply moved by the warm handshakes and pleasant gazes of the Chinese friends I met, their unwavering concern and attention to our life and culture, and their respect and love for our Soviet people.
    How many new things I learned from my Chinese friends! About China and China's thousands of years of history, about the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle for freedom, about China's ancient and outstanding culture, and about Chinese literature, which has an extremely long and rich history and is now full of new strength and talent. Contact with the life, culture, and people of free China has greatly enriched my knowledge as a person and a writer.
    After returning to my country, I will definitely tell our people everything I saw in your beautiful country and introduce to them how the Chinese people are fighting for the construction of socialism, for the defense of peace, and for the friendship of the people of all countries.
    When I was in China, I had the first drafts of some new poems praising the new life of People's China. I believe that through my poems and essays, I can tell my readers more or less about the current life and future of our great friend—the People's Republic of China.
    I am returning to my hometown, Soviet Lithuania, with the enthusiastic smiles and gazes of my new friends and their respect and friendly wishes for our great motherland—the Soviet Union. I will do everything in my power to strengthen the unbreakable friendship and cultural cooperation between the people of our two countries.
    I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and its leaders and staff, as well as to the many Chinese friends, for their invaluable help in introducing the economy and culture of the Chinese people to me during my visit to China.
    May the friendship and solidarity of the literature and writers of China and the Soviet Union continue to develop and consolidate!

    苏联文化代表团团长等发表访华观感
    杰尼索夫
    【新华社二十九日讯】苏联文化代表团团长、苏联对外文化协会理事会主席杰尼索夫教授在十月二十九日发表访问中国的观感，全文如下：
    应中苏友好协会总会邀请来中国访问的苏联文化代表团，一个月来在中华人民共和国的首都北京，以及在各巨大的经济和文化中心，有机会与政治和社会活动家们，与科学界、国民教育、文艺界的人士，与工人、职员、集体农场的农民和合作社社员们进行了多次的会面。我们的中国朋友们对于我们代表团所提出的所有的问题——这些问题并不少，并且涉及国家生活的各个方面，都乐意地给我们做了相应的解答。苏联文化代表团的团员们怀着愉快的心情，根据中国同志们提出的要求，就苏联人民的生活情况做了报告和演讲，并回答了他们提出的各种问题。
    在代表团访问过的一切城市和乡村里，都可以看到劳动人民显著的成就和胜利。代表团在了解中国人民的生活时，很愉快地看到了五年来人民民主制度大大的巩固、确立了以工人阶级为领导的人民政权、奠定了真正民主的法律的基础。勤劳而智慧的人民的一切成就——在国民经济中建立社会主义成分，建立新的和改造旧的工业企业，国民教育、国民公共卫生、文学和艺术的显著高涨，人民群众生活水平的显著提高等等——在今年九月底所通过的中华人民共和国宪法中，都得到了法律上的表现和确定。
    人民中国的城市和乡村的劳动者以大规模的组织性、政治的和劳动的积极性给了代表团以强有力的不可磨灭的印象。中国社会的先进力量普遍地结成了广大的战线在向前迈进。他们为伟大的事业进行着斗争，这个事业的胜利将把中国变成为伟大的社会主义强国。中国共产党所制订的过渡时期总路线成为全国人民前进的方向。在建设社会主义的道路上有不少困难，社会主义建设者能够发现这些困难，并且知道怎样同这些困难作斗争，他们满怀着克服这些困难的信心。
    苏联文化代表团非常高兴地看到了中国人民对苏联人民日益增涨的友谊，看到了智力和体力劳动者愿以自己的贡献来进一步巩固两大国人民——中国人民和苏联人民——的友谊和加强文化合作的热烈愿望。
    我们代表团对许许多多的中国朋友和同志表示感激和谢意，代表们一致欢呼：
    中国人民和苏联人民的伟大友谊与全面的兄弟般的合作万岁！
    彼得罗夫斯基
    【新华社二十九日讯】苏联文化代表团团员、国立莫斯科大学校长彼得罗夫斯基院士在二十六日发表访问中国的观感，全文如下：
    到许多中国的高等学校参观访问，给我留下了难以忘怀的印象。我到处都看到充满热情、富有天才和热爱劳动的学生。我认识了许多把一切力量献给教学工作的教授和教员，使我很满意。我到处都看到了中华人民共和国政府对发展高等教育的巨大关怀。我所访问过的许多高等学校，都正在修建新的大楼，装备新的化验室。
    我衷心地祝贺中国各高等学校在培养对祖国、对中国社会主义建设事业无限忠诚的高度熟练的专门人材的事业上获得巨大的成就。
    苏联科学家对人民中国在文化建设和国民经济建设上所取得的每项新的成就都感到非常高兴。我们把这种成就看做是全体进步人类的成就、是和平事业的成就。
    祝中苏两国科学家之间的友谊联系日益加强！
      文茨洛瓦
    【新华社讯】苏联文化代表团团员、苏联作家协会理事会主席团委员、立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国作家协会理事会主席文茨洛瓦在二十七日发表访问中国的观感，全文如下：
    我永远也不会忘记，一九五四年我作为苏联文化代表团一名团员在中华人民共和国渡过的十月。在这一个月的过程当中，我们看到了很多令人高兴并难以忘怀的新东西：中华人民共和国建国五周年全国人民的庆祝大典、怀仁堂里举行的盛大的国庆庆祝会、北京天安门广场上因胜利而兴高采烈的人们的游行队伍。它是那样的团结、美丽、生气勃勃……中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东、中华人民共和国的政府领导者们和以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联政府代表团一起站在主席台上。
    我们亲眼看到了沈阳，巨人似的鞍山钢铁公司和抚顺煤矿；中国伟大的民主主义者的陵墓——南京中山陵；沸腾着幸福生活的自由上海的繁荣街道；碧水映天、秋波荡漾的杭州西湖和炎热的华南广东的街道；武汉的长江防水堤；自由人民伟大的英勇劳动，其威力与天才令人惊赞并引以为骄傲。凡是我们到过的地方，我们到处都看到了人民正在进行热情的劳动和创造。
    我永远不会忘记在人民中国很多城市同中国作家和艺术家的会见。
    同中国朋友会见时热烈的握手和愉快的目光，他们对我国生活和文化始终不移的关怀和重视，他们对我们苏维埃人民的敬意和热爱使我深受感动。
    我从我的中国友人那里知道了多少新事呵！关于中国和中国几千年的历史，关于中国人民为争取自由所进行的反帝反封建的斗争，关于中国古远而杰出的文化，以及关于具有极其悠久而又丰富的历史、现在又充满着新生力量和才能的中国文学。由于接触到自由中国的生活、文化和人民，使我作为一个人和一个作家的知识大大地丰富了。
    回国以后，我一定要把自己在你们这个美丽的国家所看到的一切转告给我国人民，向他们介绍中国人民怎样为建设社会主义，为保卫和平和各国人民友好而斗争。
    我在中国的时候，就产生了歌颂人民中国新生活的一些新诗篇的初稿。我相信，通过我的诗和随笔，能多多少少地把我们伟大的朋友——中华人民共和国——现在的生活和她的前途告诉给我的读者。
    我的心里怀着我的新朋友们的热情的微笑和目光以及他们对我们伟大的祖国——苏联的敬意与友好的赠言，返回到我的故乡，苏维埃立陶宛去。我要尽自己的一切力量来加强我们两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊和文化合作。
    我愿意向中苏友好协会及其领导方面和工作人员以及许许多多的中国朋友们表示深深的感谢，感谢他们当我们在中国的国土上进行参观访问的期间向我介绍中国人民的经济和文化时所给予的不可估计的帮助。
    祝苏中两国文学和作家们的友谊与团结日益发展和巩固！
