Esteemed Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, dear friends and comrades:

    Please allow me to extend to you the warmest welcome, and to express my heartfelt thanks to you for attending today's reception celebrating the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

    The people of the German Democratic Republic are celebrating this fifth National Day with pride, because under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and with the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, they have already achieved great successes in all aspects of social life while systematically building the foundations of socialism. The German Democratic Republic is a bastion in the German people's national struggle to establish a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany. After the bankruptcy of the so-called "European Defense Community," the American imperialists and their servants, primarily Adenauer, concocted new conspiracies in an attempt to accelerate West Germany's rearmament and turn it into a new base for the American imperialists' aggressive adventures against the Soviet Union, the European People's Democracies, and the German Democratic Republic. In view of this fact, the German people's national struggle, as well as the significance of the German Democratic Republic as a bastion in this struggle for the German people's national survival and the maintenance of European peace, has become even greater.

    The great achievements of the German Democratic Republic are inseparable from the fraternal and selfless assistance that the Soviet Union has given us in building a new Germany since the day the heroic Soviet army liberated the German people from fascist rule. On the international political stage, the Soviet Union has consistently and steadfastly supported the just demands of the German people, both in the past and now. The Soviet government, in accordance with its statement of March 26, 1954, handed over to the German Democratic Republic all sovereign rights to decide all domestic and foreign affairs, thereby greatly strengthening and consolidating our republic's domestic and international position.

    The German Democratic Republic also maintains firm friendships with the countries of the peace camp. In political, economic, and cultural fields, we have established fraternal and close relations with them, and are increasingly successfully cooperating.

    Close friendship and cooperation unite the German people and the great Chinese people. The people of the German Democratic Republic are jubilantly celebrating the great construction achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects of social life and in gradually laying the foundations for socialism under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party. The peace-loving forces of East and West Germany, divided by the American imperialists, are watching with deep sympathy the efforts of the Chinese people to drive the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique from Taiwan and return Taiwan Province to the embrace of the People's Republic of China in order to defend China's territorial integrity.

    Through the visit of Premier of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai to the German Democratic Republic, the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Germany and China has been greatly consolidated and deepened.

    In the joint communiqué of the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and Germany on July 25, 1954, the government of the German Democratic Republic and the government of the People's Republic of China expressed complete agreement to resolutely continue the policy of international peaceful cooperation and friendship between all nations. The German people's national liberation struggle has thus gained great support.

    The great and inestimable assistance given to the German Democratic Republic by countries that have friendly relations with it has filled the German people with deep gratitude and strengthened the confidence of all democratic and peace-loving forces in Germany in the inevitable victory of their just cause.

    Long live the German Democratic Republic, the bastion of the peace-loving and democratic forces of the German people!

    Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation

### 柯尼希大使在招待会上的讲话

    柯尼希大使在招待会上的讲话敬爱的中华人民共和国副主席：亲爱的朋友们、同志们：
    请允许我向诸位表示最热烈的欢迎，并对诸位出席今天庆祝德意志民主共和国建国五周年的招待会，表示衷心的感谢。
    德意志民主共和国人民怀着自豪的心情，庆祝这第五个国庆日，因为他们在德国统一社会党的领导和苏联全面的无私援助下，已经在有计划地建设社会主义基础时，在社会生活各方面获得了巨大的成就。德意志民主共和国是全德人民争取建立一个统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国的民族斗争中的堡垒。在所谓“欧洲防务集团”破产以后，美国帝国主义者和他们的仆从，首先是阿登纳，策划了新的阴谋，企图加速西德的重新武装，把它变为美帝国主义反对苏联、欧洲各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的新的侵略冒险的进军基地。鉴于这个事实，德国人民的民族斗争，以及在这个争取德国人民民族生存，和维护欧洲和平斗争中的堡垒——德意志民主共和国的意义，就变得更加重大了。
    德意志民主共和国所获得的巨大成就，是和从英勇的苏联军队把德国人民从法西斯统治下解放出来那一天起，在建设新德国时，苏联所给予我们的兄弟般的无私援助分不开的。在国际政治舞台上，苏联过去和现在都不断地始终如一地支持着德国人民的正义要求。苏联政府根据它一九五四年三月二十六日的声明，将决定一切国内外事务的全部主权交给了德意志民主共和国，从而大大地加强和巩固了我们共和国的国内地位和国际地位。
    德意志民主共和国也和和平阵营各国保持着牢固的友谊。在政治、经济和文化各方面，我们和它们建立了兄弟般的亲密关系，并日益更加成功地进行合作。
    亲密的友谊与合作把德国人民和伟大的中国人民团结在一起。德意志民主共和国人民欢欣鼓舞地庆贺中国人民在光荣的共产党领导下，在社会生活各方面以及在逐步为社会主义建立基础方面所获得的伟大建设成就。被美国帝国主义者所分裂的德国东西部爱好和平的力量，怀着深切的同情，注视着中国人民要把蒋介石卖国集团从台湾赶走，使台湾省回到中华人民共和国的怀抱里来以保卫中国领土完整的努力。
    通过中华人民共和国总理周恩来在德意志民主共和国的访问，德中两国人民之间的友谊与合作获得了大大的巩固和加深。
    在一九五四年七月二十五日中德两国总理会谈公报中，德意志民主共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府完全一致表示，要坚决继续国际和平合作和各民族友好的政策。德国人民的民族解放斗争从而获得了巨大的支持。
    和德意志民主共和国有着友好关系的各国，给予德意志民主共和国的伟大不可估计的援助，使德国人民感到深深的感谢，并加强了全德民主力量和爱好和平的力量对他们正义事业必然胜利的信心。
    德国人民的爱好和平和民主力量的堡垒——德意志民主共和国万岁！
    德国人民和伟大的中国人民之间牢不可破的友谊和合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
