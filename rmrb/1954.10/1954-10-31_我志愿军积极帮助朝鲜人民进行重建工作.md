Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 30th: This year, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units have achieved significant results in helping the Korean people in their recovery and reconstruction work, and have been warmly praised by the Korean people.

According to incomplete statistics, in the first six months of this year, the Volunteer Army units helped the Korean people build 661 dikes along the Aishan River, Longchuan River, etc., with a total length of more than 171,400 meters; more than 540 irrigation canals, with a total length of more than 181,800 meters; repaired 6 river courses, with a total length of more than 10,600 meters; and repaired 4 large reservoirs. These projects involved the excavation and filling of more than 2,088,300 cubic meters of earth and stone. In the first six months, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also helped the Korean people build 463 bridges for highways and railways, 11 enterprise buildings such as brick and tile factories, 13,063 houses, and 172 cinemas, hospitals, auditoriums, government offices, etc. The Volunteer Army units also helped Korean farmers cultivate, plant, transplant rice seedlings, weed, and harvest crops on a total of more than 17,836,000 *pyeong* of land, and planted more than 8,866,700 trees. In addition, the Volunteer Army units helped the Korean people in the construction of railways, highways, pastures, and sluice gates. For all the above items, the Volunteer Army units contributed a total of more than 1,839,600 workdays.

The tremendous assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is conducive to the progress of the Korean people's post-war recovery and construction. The water conservancy projects completed by the Volunteer Army units stationed on the west coast not only prevent local floods and droughts, but also irrigate nearby farmland, enabling local farmers to increase grain production by more than 17,000 tons each year. The water conservancy projects completed by the Volunteer Army units stationed on the east coast also irrigated more than 2,042,000 *pyeong* of farmland. According to estimates by the Hwanghae-do People's Committee, the water conservancy projects and pastures, brick and tile factories, and other five projects built by a certain unit of the Volunteer Army to help the people of Hwanghae-do saved the Korean government more than 200,000 labor forces, more than 290,000 kilograms of grain, and more than 10 million won (equivalent to more than 410 million yuan in our currency). After the several brick and tile factories built with the help of the Volunteer Army in Sariwon, Sinanju, and Yongjiwon-ri, Kosan County, were put into production, they supplied a large number of bricks and tiles needed for construction projects in Pyongyang, Kaesong, Anju, Pakcheon, and Mundok.

The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army regard helping the Korean people in post-war recovery work as their glorious responsibility. "Help the Korean people build Korea as if we were building our own country!" has become a common slogan among the Volunteer Army soldiers. During construction, many soldiers competed with each other to ensure the over-fulfillment of construction plans. Many units and individuals created advanced operating methods and constantly improved work efficiency. Soldiers of a certain unit sped up the progress of the project by more than two times by constantly studying and improving methods of digging and carrying earth. The soldiers also saved a large amount of resources for the Korean people during construction. In half a year, a certain engineering unit of the Volunteer Army, which helped build Pyongyang, created 136 types of tools and equipment with more than 106,000 pieces from old materials, which not only saved a large number of new materials, but also enabled the completion of the Taedong River pontoon bridge a month ahead of schedule.

The Korean people deeply appreciate the selfless assistance given to them by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units. The Korean government and people from various regions sent many art troupes, song and dance troupes, film teams, farmer performance teams, and mass comfort groups to various construction sites and Volunteer Army unit驻地(zhù dì, garrison) to offer their regards and performances. People from all over Korea also presented the Volunteer Army units with 219 pennants, more than 600 letters of gratitude, more than 21,000 letters of appreciation, and 264,000 *jin* of vegetables, fish, and other food gifts. In order to permanently commemorate the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the people of various parts of Korea established memorial towers and monuments at many construction sites, and named many newly built projects "China-Korea Friendship Dike," "Warrior Dam," "Brother Dam," "China-Korea Friendship Propaganda Room," and "Friendship Bridge," etc.

    我志愿军积极帮助朝鲜人民进行重建工作
    【新华社平壤三十日电】　今年中国人民志愿军各部队帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复和重建的工作获得了显著成绩，受到了朝鲜人民的热烈赞扬。
    据不完全统计，志愿军各部队在今年的头六个月里，共帮助朝鲜人民修筑了艾山江、龙川江等堤坝六百六十一条，总长十七万一千四百多公尺；水渠五百四十多条，总长十八万一千八百多公尺；修治了河道六条，总长一万零六百多公尺；另外，补修了四个大型贮水池。这些工程，共出土石和填土石二百零八万八千三百多立方公尺。在头六个月里，中国人民志愿军还帮助朝鲜人民修建公路和铁路的桥梁四百六十三座，砖瓦工厂等企业建筑十一座，房屋一万三千零六十三间，电影院、医院、礼堂、政府机关办公室等一百七十二座。志愿军各部队还帮助朝鲜农民在总计一千七百八十三万六千多坪的土地里进行了开荒、耕种、插秧、锄草和收割等劳动，并植树八百八十六万六千七百多棵。另外，志愿军部队帮助朝鲜人民进行了修建铁路、公路、牧场和闸门等工作。以上各项，志愿军部队共出了一百八十三万九千六百多个工作日。
    中国人民志愿军的巨大帮助，有利于朝鲜人民战后恢复工作和建设事业的进展。驻西海岸志愿军部队完成的水利工程，不但能防止当地水、旱灾害，并且使附近的农田得到灌溉，当地农民因此每年能增产一万七千多吨粮食。驻东海岸志愿军部队完成的水利工程，也使二百零四万二千多坪农田得到了灌溉。志愿军某部帮助黄海道朝鲜人民修建的水利工程和牧场、砖瓦工厂等五项工程，据黄海道人民委员会估计，就使朝鲜政府节省了二十万以上的劳动力，二十九万多公斤粮食，一千万元（合我国人民币四亿一千多万元）以上的资金。志愿军帮助修建的沙里院、新安州和高山郡龙池院里等地的几个砖瓦工厂投入生产后，就使平壤、开城、安州、博川和文德等地建筑工程所需的大量砖瓦得到了供应。
    中国人民志愿军广大指战员把帮助朝鲜人民进行战后恢复工作看做是自己光荣的责任。“要像建设祖国一样来帮助朝鲜人民建设朝鲜！”成了志愿军战士们共同的口号。施工中，许多战士互相竞赛，保证超额完成施工计划。许多单位和个人创造了先进的作业方法，不断提高着工作效率。某部战士由于不断研究和改进了挖土和抬土的方法，就使工程进展的速度加快了两倍多。战士们还在施工中为朝鲜人民节约了大批资财。帮助建设平壤市的志愿军工兵部队某部，在半年里利用旧材创造的工具和器材就有一百三十六种、十万六千多件，不但节约了大批新料，并且使大同江便桥提前一个月完工。
    朝鲜人民深切感谢中国人民志愿军部队给予他们的无私的援助。朝鲜政府和各地人民派出了许多艺术团、歌舞团、电影队、农民演出队和群众慰问组，到各工地和志愿军部队驻地进行慰问和演出。朝鲜各地人民还献给志愿军各部队锦旗二百一十九面，感谢状六百多份，慰问信二万一千多封，蔬菜、鱼和其他食品等礼物二十六万四千多斤。朝鲜各地人民为了永久纪念中国人民志愿军对他们的帮助，在许多工地上建立了纪念塔和纪念碑，并且把许多新建成的工程命名为“中朝亲善堤”、“勇士坝”“兄弟坝”“中朝友谊宣传室”和“友谊桥”等。
