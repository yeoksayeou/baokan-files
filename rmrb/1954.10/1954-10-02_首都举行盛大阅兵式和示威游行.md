Peng Zhen, Mayor of Beijing, announced the commencement of the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. At this moment, the band played the national anthem and the artillery fired a salute. Then, the military parade began. Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, departed from Tiananmen Gate by car, and, accompanied by Yang Chengwu, Deputy Commander of the North China Military Region and Commander-in-Chief of the parade, reviewed the troops lined up in the square, and extended festive congratulations to them. After the review, Peng Dehuai stepped onto the reviewing stand and issued orders to the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The march-past began. The students of the highest military academy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—the Military Academy—first marched into Tiananmen Square in formation. Following them were the student teams of the Infantry School, Artillery School, Engineering School, Tank School, Aviation School, and Naval School. They are intensifying their studies of Marxism-Leninism and learning advanced Soviet military science and technology to build our country's modern national defense.

Sailors marched in mighty steps past the reviewing stand. They represent the increasingly powerful naval fleet on our country's vast oceans. Continuing to march past were the public security forces of the Chinese people, vigilantly safeguarding national construction and national order.

Then, powerful tractors pulled cannons of various calibers through Tiananmen Gate. Finally, huge tank self-propelled artillery, known as "mobile fire fortresses," passed through the square. The Chinese People's Army has been tempered into an invincible force in the Chinese revolutionary struggle. Now they are striving to further build a modern army.

As the ground troops passed through the square, heroic iron eagles appeared in the sky, two fighter jets escorting a lead plane flying in front, followed by heavy bombers, jet bombers, and fighter jets, in formations, sweeping over Tiananmen.

The reviewed troops demonstrated outstanding training achievements and powerful combat capabilities. The heroic and invincible Chinese People's Liberation Army has opened up the road for the Chinese people to build socialism. Now, with the support of the people of the whole country, they are fighting for the liberation of Taiwan, the complete elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the defense of socialist construction and the cause of socialist transformation, and the safeguarding of the security of the motherland and lasting world peace.

The military parade lasted one hour and three minutes. After it ended, the mass festive demonstration began.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st of the month: Today, 500,000 people in Beijing held a grand festive parade to warmly celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

As the magnificent Tiananmen Gate emerged from the morning glow, the crowds participating in the parade, holding flags and bouquets, singing songs, poured towards Tiananmen Square along the streets. The people of the capital, like the people of the whole country, were particularly joyful and inspired today, with every household hanging the national flag, warmly celebrating our country's brilliant achievements over the past five years; celebrating the success of the First Session of the First National People's Congress; celebrating the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China; celebrating the election of new national leaders; and celebrating the victory of our country's peaceful diplomatic policy.

After the military parade, at 11:04 a.m., the parade began. Leading the way was a guard of honor composed of 1,400 railway workers. They carried the national emblem and the slogan "Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China." They carried a huge portrait of Mao Zedong and portraits of his close comrades-in-arms Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Chen Yun. They carried a portrait of Sun Yat-sen. They carried portraits of the great teachers of the working people of the world, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

Next were 8,000 members of the Chinese Young Pioneers, holding up a golden banner with the words "Always Be Ready," cheering and jumping forward. They represent the future of the motherland, receiving special care from the state, and growing up in a happy life.

The marching contingents lined up in seventy columns and moved forward mightily. Across the front of the 130,000-strong workers' contingent was a giant banner with the words "Strive to Complete the First Five-Year Plan." A team of workers, surrounding a huge model of a blast furnace, came over. These were the metallurgical workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. They shouted the slogan "Liberate Taiwan, Eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek Traitorous Clique." On the eve of National Day, they fulfilled their promise to support the liberation of Taiwan, producing 808 tons more pig iron and overfulfilling the September plan. Leading their contingent was a group of labor models wearing medals, and the whole place applauded them warmly. Over the past few years, this factory has produced a total of 499 labor models and 73 advanced production units. Under their leadership, the plant's employees increased pig iron production by 13.73 times in 1953 compared to 1949. Like the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, metallurgical workers across the country are accelerating the construction of our country's iron and steel industry. The charts carried by the parade showed that the national pig iron production in 1953 increased more than eight times compared to 1949, and steel increased more than ten times. The parade carried tall models of vertical shaft coal mining derricks, oil refineries, and hydroelectric power stations. Charts nearby showed that the total output value of our country's fuel industry has increased by 209 percent in the past five years. Among the coal miners' contingent, the young drilling worker Geng Xiangshun has participated in the construction of six mines. He is currently drilling at the Mentougou construction site, where a mechanized mine will be built. When the workers of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition, passed in front of the reviewing stand, they shouted slogans supporting the Constitution. Thirty-three years ago, the workers of this factory, under the leadership of Chinese communists, organized the first trade union of Chinese workers. In order to accelerate the pace of the motherland towards socialism, they completed the national output value plan 13 days ahead of schedule from January to September this year.

Many workers from mechanical factories in the capital participated in the parade today. Workers from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory carried models of new-style farm implements forward. During the First Session of the First National People's Congress, the entire factory saw 409 new records and major inventions and creations. Over the past five years, they have produced a total of 450,000 new-style farm implements, supporting farmers in developing production. Now they are designing combine harvesters. Among the workers' contingent was a group of young men and women around the age of twenty. These were workers from the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, which went into operation a week ago. As of September this year, a total of thirteen newly built state-owned and local state-owned cotton textile factories have gone into operation nationwide. The contingent from the Ministry of Geology carried a distribution map of Chinese mineral resources and models of mineral exploration workers and drilling towers, indicating that more new factories and mines will soon appear on the vast fields of the motherland. 40,000 construction workers shouted "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship" as they marched forward. They carried a magnificent model of the Soviet Exhibition Hall. Tomorrow, the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition will open here. This exhibition will further help our people learn from the Soviet Union's socialist construction experience and strengthen the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

The charts carried by the parade indicated that this year's national grain output is expected to increase by 53 percent compared to 1949, cotton by 187 percent, aquatic products by 365 percent, and hairy pigs by more than double. When suburban farmers entered the square, the whole place warmly applauded to thank the hardworking farmers for their support of national construction. The farmers, holding models of vegetables, fruits, and dairy cows, marched forward, promising to produce large quantities of vegetables, milk, and meat to supply the people of the capital. Members of the Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative, who completed 600 greenhouses on the eve of National Day, also came to participate in the parade. This winter, they can produce 116,000 catties of vegetables. Members of the Laiguangying Agricultural Production Cooperative carried charts marking their bumper harvests, explaining that the yields of crops grown by organized farmers are more than double that of ordinary farmers in the area. The farmers warmly cheered Chairman Mao, thanking the Chinese Communist Party and the working class for leading them on the road to a happy life. There are now a total of 412 agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing, and farmers are extremely interested in joining agricultural production cooperatives. After the autumn harvest, Zhangguozhuang Township and Huangtugang Township can basically be cooperativized.

In the tide-like parade, "We Must Liberate Taiwan" signs were held high everywhere, and people constantly shouted the slogan "We Must Liberate Taiwan." The parade crowd excitedly cheered the most beloved people—the representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning from Korea. They are a symbol of the boundless strength of the motherland's just cause. In order to liberate Taiwan, the people of the capital have further launched production competitions and actively supported this struggle in all aspects. Before National Day, 85 industrial and mining enterprises in the capital completed the third quarter's national production plan.

140,000 students cheered as they entered the square. In the past few years, universities in the capital have sent more than 17,000 cadres to the state. In the new school year, another 17,000 people have entered more than 20 universities such as Peking University, Renmin University of China, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University. They come from all over the country and are receiving Chairman Mao's review for the first time. Holding high banners with the words "Good Health, Good Studies, Good Work," wearing neat and beautiful clothes, and waving bouquets, they warmly cheered Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to study hard and serve the construction of the motherland in the future. Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, with more than 300 flags adorned with aircraft shapes, formed an aviation model team, surrounding three giant aircraft models as they moved forward. As they passed Tiananmen Gate, they released teams of model aircraft. People cheered for the rapid growth of these future aircraft manufacturers who will strengthen national defense and develop the aviation transportation industry.

Countless signs were written with the word "Peace," and countless doves of peace flew from the parade. In the civilian contingent from Dongdan District, a team of people holding olive branches surrounded a rotating giant model of the earth, on which a dove of peace was flying. They also held up a banner with the words "Long Live World Peace." In the past five years, our country has established or is in the process of establishing diplomatic relations with 25 countries with a population of about one billion. More than 60 countries have sent delegations and representatives to visit China more than 300 times; at the same time, our country has also sent delegations and representatives to more than 20 countries, making more than 200 visits. This year, more international friends, including over 1,000 from more than 40 countries, are participating in our National Day celebrations than in any previous year. There are also representatives from more than a dozen countries on their way. As the parading masses passed the reviewing stand, they continuously cheered "Long Live World Peace!" The foreign guests also continuously waved to the parading masses in greeting.

The parading masses, wearing new festive attire, showed that the people's lives have improved considerably on the basis of production development. Charts from the Central Ministry of Textile Industry told people that in the past five years, the output of cotton cloth in state-owned textile factories nationwide in 1954 increased more than three times compared to 1949, and the output of cotton yarn increased more than twice. The variety of designs and colors increased even more.

The number of cinema audience members in 1953 increased more than tenfold compared to 1949. More than 400 young men and women of various ethnic groups, surrounding a budding flower over ten feet tall, entered in front of Tiananmen Gate. When this brilliant flower bloomed, ten beautiful dancing girls appeared in the pistil, showing the art of the people of our various ethnic groups, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy, "let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new."

The last to pass through Tiananmen Square was the sports contingent. In the multicolored flags, teams of athletes wearing sports uniforms of various colors continuously shouted loud slogans: "Exercise to Build the Motherland"; "Exercise to Defend the Motherland"; "Exercise to Defend Peace." Their healthy physiques, vigorous steps, and skillful gymnastics showed the state's special concern for the development of youth fitness.

At this moment, countless fireworks rose into the air, and light balloons carrying the slogans "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party" and "Long Live the People's Republic of China" floated over Tiananmen. In the midst of the boiling cheers, Chairman Mao waved to foreign guests and the masses on both sides of the Tiananmen Gate tower.

    游行群众纷纷抬着布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、赫鲁晓夫的画像。首都人民向无私地援助中国人民进行建设的苏联人民致敬。
    他们抬着金日成、胡志明、贝鲁特、萨波托斯基、皮克、乔治乌—德治、拉科西、契尔文科夫、霍查、泽登巴尔的画像。首都人民向同中国人民结成亲密友谊的兄弟国家人民致敬。
    无数标语牌上写着“和平”，无数的和平鸽从游行队伍中飞起。东单区的市民队伍中，一队手拿橄榄叶的群众拥着一个转动的巨大地球模型，上面
  一只和平鸽在飞翔。他们还高举着“世界和平万岁”的字标。我国五年来已同约有十亿人口的二十五个国家建立或正在建立外交关系。有六十多个国家派出了代表团和代表，到中国作过三百多次访问；同时我国也派出代表团和代表到二十多个国家，作过两百多次访问。今年有比历年更多的，包括四十多个国家的一千多位国际朋友参加了我国国庆观礼。还有十几个国家的代表正在途中。游行群众走过观礼台时不断向他们欢呼“世界和平万岁！”外宾们也向游行群众不断招手致意。
    穿着节日新装的游行群众，说明了人民在生产发展的基础上，生活有了不少改善。中央纺织工业部的图表告诉人们：五年来全国国营纺织厂棉布产量一九五四年比一九四九年增加了三倍多，棉纱产量增加了一倍多。花色品种增加更多，只中国花纱布公司北京市公司经营的花布就从二十多种增加到一千多种。游行队伍中许多图表表明人民越来越丰富的文化生活。新华书店人员高举的图表说明全国五年来共发行了马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的经典著作一千九百二十五万二千册，毛主席的著作二千八百四十六万五千册。
    文艺工作者的队伍跟随着毛主席在规划国家建设计划的巨大塑像后面前进。他们抬着共同奋斗的标语牌：“提高艺术修养，努力艺术实践”。这里有戏曲演员、音乐舞蹈演员，有新成长起来的儿童剧小演员，有美术工作者。人们抬着的图表写下他们从事艺术活动的成就：首都戏剧一九五○年到一九五三年演出二千八百零四场，观众四百三十九万二千三百九十三人次。电影院的观众一九五三年较一九四九年增加到十倍多。四百多个各族青年男女，簇拥着含苞待放的一枝一丈多高的花朵进到天安门前，这枝灿烂的花朵开放时，花蕊里出现十个舞蹈着的美丽姑娘，它显示我国各族人民的艺术，在毛主席的文艺方针照耀下“百花齐放，推陈出新”。
    最后走过天安门广场的是体育大队。在五光十色的旗帜里，一队队穿着各种颜色运动服的运动员们不断地喊出嘹亮的口号：“锻炼身体，建设祖国”；“锻炼身体，保卫祖国”；“锻炼身体，保卫和平”。他们健壮的体质、雄劲的步伐，和技巧娴熟的体操，表现了国家特别关怀青年体力的发展。
    游行历时两小时四十二分。游行队伍通过天安门后，广场内少年先锋队队员和机关干部拥向天安门，向毛主席热烈欢呼。这时，空中腾起了无数的礼花，轻气球带着“中国共产党万岁”、“中华人民共和国万岁”的标语在天安门上空飘扬，毛主席在沸腾的欢呼中，到天安门城楼两侧向外宾和群众招手致意。数万群众齐声地持续地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”
