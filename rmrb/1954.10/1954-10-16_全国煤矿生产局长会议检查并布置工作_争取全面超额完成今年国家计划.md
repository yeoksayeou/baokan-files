    National Coal Mine Production Bureau Chiefs Conference Inspects and Deploys Work
    Striving to Comprehensively Exceed This Year's National Plan
      [This newspaper dispatch] The Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry convened a national coal mine production bureau chiefs conference from October 10th to 12th. The conference examined the production work of state-owned coal mines this year and deployed tasks for the fourth quarter. The conference called on national state-owned coal mines to strive to comprehensively complete and strive to over fulfill this year's national production plan, and to do a good job in preparing for next year's production.
    The overall production situation of national state-owned coal mines this year is good. The output of raw coal from January to September has exceeded the national plan, but there are still many problems in production. Although the cost has generally decreased, the consumption of major materials has seriously exceeded the plan. From January to August, the national consumption of pit timber exceeded the budget by more than 51,000 cubic meters, and the consumption of gunpowder exceeded the budget by more than 720,000 kilograms. These two items alone caused the country to lose 33 billion yuan. The quality of raw coal in many coal mines has a downward trend. There are also some problems in production management and technical management, especially: The imbalance of the main links in production – geology, tunneling, and extraction – has not been overcome. Surveying work cannot keep up with production needs. According to incomplete statistics from the third quarter alone, the lack of clear geological conditions resulted in a reduction of more than 150,000 tons of coal. The utilization rate of coal mining machinery in various coal mines is low. In the first half of the year, about two-thirds of the coal cutting machines nationwide were not used. The phenomenon of unreasonable labor organization still exists. From January to August this year, the total number of employees in national state-owned coal mines exceeded the plan by more than 9,000 people. Many coal mines have large organizational structures, high worker turnover, low attendance rates, and serious overtime. From January to August this year, the state paid an additional 29.2 billion yuan in wages and subsidies due to overtime. Coal mine safety issues are still very serious.
    The conference discussed the above-mentioned problems in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and criticized complacency and conservative thinking. The conference pointed out that leading cadres at all levels cannot be satisfied with average figures, but should know that many backward units and unreasonable phenomena are hidden in the average figures, and should discover the weak links and key problems in the work from the average figures. Only in this way can our work continue to move forward. The conference particularly emphasized that this year is an important year in the country's Five-Year Construction Plan, and at the same time, in order to support the liberation of Taiwan and overcome certain difficulties caused by this year's floods, completing this year's national plan is even more important. As the pioneering industry, the coal mining industry should comprehensively complete and over fulfill the national plan, not only should complete the quantity, variety, and quality indicators, but also complete and over fulfill labor productivity, cost and other indicators. Under the slogan of increasing production and practicing economy, we should strengthen all aspects of work, correct shortcomings, and establish a normal system of increasing production and practicing economy.
    At the meeting, reports were heard on the production reform of Kailuan Coal Mine and the restoration and reconstruction of Jixi, Tonghua, and Jiaohe Coal Mines, as well as the report on the rectification of labor organization in Jiaozuo Coal Mine. The conference requested that the mining bureaus in various regions refer to these experiences, overcome the shortcomings in this year's production, continue to rectify the labor organization, vigorously strengthen geological and surveying work, strengthen the organizational structure of mine geology, and train technical personnel to make geological work ahead of tunneling and coal mining. Mining should be carried out in accordance with mining procedures, and various old coal mining methods that damage resources should be eliminated. The utilization rate of machinery should be improved, the maintenance of machinery should be strengthened, and efforts should be made to reduce mechanical and electrical accidents.
    The meeting also studied the issues of training coal mine management cadres, technical cadres, and skilled workers. The meeting believed that this is one of the urgent tasks in the current coal mine construction. The meeting decided to train new cadres and workers and improve the technical and cultural level of existing cadres and workers through various methods such as combining production and apprentice training, holding various amateur technical research associations, short-term training courses for special technicians, technical schools, and technical research classes for senior cadres.
    The meeting also heard reports from Soviet experts.

    全国煤矿生产局长会议检查并布置工作
    争取全面超额完成今年国家计划
      【本报讯】燃料工业部煤矿管理总局从十月十日至十二日，召开了全国煤矿生产局长会议。会议检查了今年国营煤矿的生产工作情况，布置了第四季度的任务。会议要求全国国营煤矿为全面完成和争取超额完成今年的国家生产计划，并做好明年的生产准备工作而努力。
    全国国营煤矿今年生产情况总的说是好的，一至九月份原煤产量已超额完成国家计划，但生产中仍存在许多问题。成本虽然总的表现降低了，但主要材料消耗都严重地超过计划，一至八月份全国坑木消耗超支五万一千多立方公尺，火药超支七十二万多公斤，仅这两项就使国家损失了三百三十亿元。许多煤矿的原煤质量有下降趋势。在生产管理和技术管理上也有一些问题，其中特别是：生产上的主要环节——地质、掘进、回采的不平衡现象未能克服，测量工作赶不上生产需要，仅据第三季度不完全统计，由于地质情况不清的影响，少产煤十五万多吨。各地煤矿机械利用率低，上半年全国割煤机约三分之二没有使用。劳动组织不合理的现象也依然存在，全国国营煤矿今年一至八月份全员人数超过计划九千多人，不少煤矿组织机构庞大，工人流动性大，出勤率低，加班加点严重，今年一至八月份国家由于加班加点而多支出了工资和津贴达二百九十二亿元。煤矿安全问题仍很严重。
    会议以批评和自我批评精神，针对上述问题进行了讨论，批判了自满情绪和保守思想。会议指出：各级领导干部不能满足于平均数字，要知道在平均数字中隐藏着许多落后单位和不合理现象，而应当从平均数字中发现工作中的薄弱环节和关键问题，只有这样，才能使我们的工作不断前进。会议特别着重指出：今年是国家五年建设计划的重要一年，同时为了支援解放台湾，克服今年由于水灾所造成的某些困难，完成今年的国家计划更有重要意义。作为先行工业的煤矿工业，更应全面完成和超额完成国家计划，不仅应完成数量、品种、质量指标，也要完成和超额完成劳动生产率、成本等指标。在增加生产、厉行节约这一口号下加强各方面的工作，改正缺点，建立正常的增产节约制度。
    会议上听取了开滦煤矿生产改革和鸡西、通化、蛟河煤矿恢复改建工作的报告，以及焦作煤矿整顿劳动组织工作的报告。会议要求各地矿务局参照这些经验，克服今年生产中的缺点，继续整顿劳动组织，大力加强地质、测量工作，加强矿井地质的组织机构，培训技术力量，使地质工作走在掘进和采煤的前面。按照开采程序进行开采，消除各种破坏资源的旧采煤方法。提高机械的利用率，加强机械检修工作，努力减少机电事故。
    会议还研究了煤矿管理干部、技术干部和技术工人的培养训练问题。会议认为这是当前煤矿建设上的迫切任务之一。会议决定以结合生产训练徒工、举办各种业余技术研究会、特种技工短期训练班、技工学校、高级干部技术研究班等各种方式，培养和训练新干部和工人，提高现有干部和工人的技术文化水平。
    会议还听了苏联专家的报告。
