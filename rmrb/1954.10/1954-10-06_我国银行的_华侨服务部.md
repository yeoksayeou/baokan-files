China People's Bank and Bank of China, according to the Central People's Government's policy of "facilitating overseas remittances and serving overseas compatriots," began establishing Overseas Chinese Service Departments in 1950, specifically to serve overseas Chinese and their families. Over the past few years, with the assistance of relevant authorities and the support and care of the broad masses of overseas Chinese and their families, Overseas Chinese Service Departments in various locations have carried out a series of tasks, embodying the Party and government's policy of concern and care for overseas Chinese and their families, and strengthening the ties between overseas Chinese and their motherland. With the development of the motherland's economic construction, the institutions of the China People's Bank and the Bank of China's Overseas Chinese Service Departments are also continuously developing. Up to now, in the main overseas Chinese areas across the country, such as Guangzhou, Shantou, Jiangmen, Haikou, Meixian, Taishan, Wenchang, and Shenzhen in Guangdong; Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Longyan, Shishi, Nan'an, and Fuqing in Fujian; as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, banks have established a total of thirty-five Overseas Chinese Service Departments. Some local banks, although they have not established Overseas Chinese Service Departments, also have designated personnel responsible for serving overseas Chinese.

During the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, overseas remittances sent back by overseas Chinese as living expenses for their families received no value guarantees due to runaway inflation and soaring prices. As the mother-in-law of Li Saijiao, a relative of an overseas Chinese in Jianyang Township, Chenghai County, Guangdong Province, said: "Before liberation, the price of rice rose three times a day. Buying the same rice on the same day, just at different times in the morning, noon, and evening, required paying three different prices. Of course, buying in the evening was more expensive than buying in the morning." She cried three times every time she bought rice: "Crying once when asking the price, crying again when buying because the price had risen, and crying again when eating because it wasn't enough to fill us up."

After liberation, when the national economy was not yet unified and the work of restoring the national economy had just begun, the foreign exchange settlement rates in various regions of the country were also not uniform. In order to take care of the economic interests of overseas Chinese and their families, the government at that time implemented preferential overseas remittance rates, settling overseas remittances at the highest rate in the country. When the value of the Renminbi was not yet stable and foreign exchange rates rose, measures were taken to remit foreign currency in its original form and issue foreign currency deposit certificates. When the value of the Renminbi had stabilized and foreign currency rates fell, Renminbi remittances were also offered. These measures by the People's Government were all to take care of, and in fact did take care of, the interests of overseas Chinese and their families.

After the State Council announced the "Measures for Paying Unsettled Deposits of Silver and Money Businesses Before Liberation" on February 20, 1953, banks in various locations successively began registration work. The Overseas Chinese Service Department also designated special personnel to fill out registration forms on behalf of overseas Chinese relatives who could not write. The deposit books, deposit certificates, drafts, and receipts attached by the applicants for registration were sometimes worm-eaten, fire-damaged, water-soaked, tattered, or used on the reverse side as accounting ledgers; these documents made it clear that the holders had lost confidence in regaining their value. Lin Xian, a relative of an overseas Chinese in Tanxi Township, Nan'an County, Fujian Province, said: "In 1937, my father-in-law originally wanted to use this deposit (7,850 yuan in puppet national currency) to build a house, but it was blocked by the hateful feudal evil forces and never got built. Later, the legal tender depreciated and became useless. I thought this money was gone. After receiving the repayment this time, I want to build a house to commemorate the kindness of the People's Government." The broad masses of overseas Chinese relatives who received repayment of deposits from before liberation were extremely excited and expressed their sincere gratitude for this measure by the People's Government.

In order to facilitate the receipt of funds by overseas Chinese relatives, banks in most overseas Chinese areas implemented the method of delivering overseas remittances to their doorsteps. In areas where the method of delivering to doorsteps was not implemented, simplified procedures were implemented. In order to avoid delays in postal and telecommunications, scheduled remittances and express remittances were organized in various locations. Overseas Chinese remittances back to the country, whether to ports or inland areas, overseas Chinese areas or non-overseas Chinese areas, could be handled by banks or post offices in various locations, guaranteeing timely delivery to recipients all over the country. For situations where the recipient's address had changed or the address was written incorrectly or omitted, the Overseas Chinese Service Departments of banks in various locations also carefully analyzed and patiently searched to ensure that the lives of overseas Chinese relatives were not affected. For example, when the Guangzhou Branch of the Bank of China settled a remittance to No. 229, Dezheng Middle Road, the remitter mistakenly wrote the house number as 779. However, thanks to the patience of the delivery personnel, who inquired from house to house from No. 77, 79, 119, 179, and 229, the recipient was finally found. Another remittance written as "Zhucui Road, Nantai, Fuzhou" found the recipient on "Zhucui Road, Nanjing."

In order to solve the difficulty of overseas Chinese relatives needing money urgently due to temporary non-arrival of overseas remittances, the Overseas Chinese Service Departments of banks in overseas Chinese areas in Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan and other provinces, and the banks in cities with a large number of returned overseas Chinese students such as Beijing, have launched low-interest, small-sum loan services for overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese students. By the end of 1953, the Fujian Branch of the Bank of China had issued 2.4 billion yuan in overseas Chinese loans. In May of last year alone, the Quanzhou Branch of the Bank of China granted 586 such loans. These loans have helped overseas Chinese and their families solve many difficulties. For example, the four-year-old son of Tang Yupo, a relative of an overseas Chinese in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, suffered from enteritis, and his condition was critical, but there was no money at home for treatment. The Overseas Chinese Service Department of the Quanzhou Branch of the Bank of China provided timely loans so that the child could be treated and recover his health. When staff from the bank's Overseas Chinese Service Department went to express their sympathy, Tang Yupo's mother said: "My grandson was saved by the People's Government. If it weren't for the bank loan, could he have been saved? I had a child before, and if he were still alive, he would be nineteen years old this year. He fell ill when he was three years old, but there was no money to hire a doctor, and no one cared for him. He was sick for a few days, and I watched him die in tears."

The Overseas Chinese Service Departments of banks in overseas Chinese areas have also carried out the collection of foreign currency and bills, and the exchange of foreign currency for returned overseas Chinese and their families, as well as investment savings, the purchase of public bonds, and custody services on behalf of overseas Chinese. Due to the trust of overseas Chinese in the Overseas Chinese Service Department, in Xiamen and Quanzhou in Fujian Province alone, 3,712 documents were kept in custody for overseas Chinese in 1953 alone. Many overseas Chinese entrust important deeds to the Overseas Chinese Service Department for safekeeping. An overseas Chinese surnamed Zheng in Surabaya, Indonesia, sent more than ten house deeds to the Overseas Chinese Service Department for safekeeping, and also sent a pre-written will.

It is very touching and not easy for relatives who live thousands of miles apart and have been out of contact for a long time to regain contact and reunite, but many such stories have happened among overseas Chinese and their families. During the Anti-Japanese War and World War II, due to the disruption of postal routes, people were displaced, so many overseas Chinese living abroad and their families in China lost contact with each other. In order to help overseas Chinese and their families separated by oceans find their relatives, the China People's Bank and the Bank of China's Overseas Chinese Service Department began establishing a service to find relatives after liberation. For example, Yang Youzhi, the husband of Huang Jinxiu, a relative of an overseas Chinese living in Xiamen, went to Yangon in 1935 to make a living and lost contact after 1939. In September of last year, Huang Jinxiu entrusted the Xiamen Branch of the Bank of China's Overseas Chinese Service Department to help find him. With the assistance of the Yangon Lujiang Association, Yang Youzhi was finally located. Yang Youzhi returned to Xiamen in November 1953 and met with his wife and daughter. According to incomplete statistics, since the liberation of the country, Overseas Chinese Service Departments of banks in various locations have accepted a total of 1,332 requests from overseas Chinese abroad and their families in China to find relatives.

Over the past few years, the Overseas Chinese Service Departments of banks in various locations have gained the great trust of overseas Chinese and their families due to their warm service to overseas Chinese and their families. Many returned overseas Chinese and their families consult the Overseas Chinese Service Department when they have something to do, and often talk to the staff of the service department when they have nothing to do. These facts further prove the correctness of the policy of "facilitating overseas remittances and serving overseas compatriots," and prove the care of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for overseas Chinese.

    我国银行的“华侨服务部”
    焕然
    中国人民银行和中国银行按照中央人民政府的
  “便利侨汇、服务侨胞”的方针，从一九五○年起开始建立了专为侨胞、侨眷服务的华侨服务部。几年来，在有关机关的协助和广大侨胞、侨眷的支持和爱护下，各地华侨服务部开展了一系列的工作，体现了党和政府关怀与照顾侨胞和侨眷的政策，并密切了侨胞和祖国的联系。随着祖国经济建设事业的发展，中国人民银行、中国银行的华侨服务部的机构也在不断的发展。到现在为止，在国内各地的主要侨区，如广东的广州、汕头、江门、海口、梅县、台山、文昌、深圳，福建的福州、厦门、泉州、漳州、龙岩、石狮、南安、福清以及北京、上海等地的银行，共已设立华侨服务部三十五个。有的地方的银行虽然没有设立华侨服务部，但也有专人负责为华侨服务的工作。
    在蒋介石反动统治时期，侨胞在国外寄回的作为一家老小生活费用的侨汇，由于恶性通货膨胀、物价飞涨，侨汇的价值得不到任何保障。正如广东省澄海县建阳乡侨眷李赛娇的婆婆说的：“解放前米价一天涨三次，同一天去买同样的米，只是早、午、晚时间不同，就得付出三种价钱。当然是晚买的比早买的更贵了。”她买一次米要哭三次：“问价钱时哭一次，买的时候因为涨了价哭一次，买回来吃不饱又哭一次。”
    解放以后，在全国财经尚未统一、国民经济的恢复工作刚刚开始的时候，国内各地区外汇解付牌价也未统一，为了照顾侨胞、侨眷的经济利益，当时政府曾实行了优待侨汇牌价，按全国最高牌价解付侨汇的办法；当人民币币值尚未稳定、外汇牌价上涨时，又采取了原币汇款，发行原币存单的措施；在人民币币值已臻稳定而外币牌价下跌时，又举办了人民币汇款。人民政府的这些措施，都是为了照顾并且在实际上也照顾了侨胞、侨眷的利益。
    一九五三年二月二十日，政务院公布了“关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”以后，各地银行都相继开始了登记工作，华侨服务部也指定专人替不会写字的侨眷代填登记表。申请登记的人所附的存折、存单、汇票、单据，有的是虫蛀过的、火烧过的、水浸过的、破烂不堪的或已用反面做了记帐本子的；这些票据，使人一看就知道，持有人对它们已失去了重新取得价值的信心。福建省南安县潭溪乡侨眷林嫌说：“一九三七年，我的翁原想把这笔存款（伪国币七千八百五十元）拿来盖房子，可是被可恨的封建恶势力阻挡着，始终没有盖成，后来法币贬值得没有用了，想这笔钱已经完了。这回领出款后，我要盖房子来纪念人民政府的恩情。”领到偿还解放前存款的广大侨眷，都异常的兴奋，并纷纷对人民政府这一措施表示真诚的感激。
    为了便利侨眷领款，大部侨区银行都实行了登门派送侨汇的办法；未实行登门派送办法的地区，则实行了简化手续的办法。为了避免邮电迟误，各地更举办了约期汇款和加急汇款，侨胞汇款回国，无论汇至口岸或内地、侨区或非侨区，各地银行或邮局都可以代办，保证及时送到全国各地的收款人手里。对于收款人住址迁移或住址书写错误、遗漏的情况，各地银行华侨服务部也仔细分析、耐心寻找，力求不致影响侨眷的生活。如中国银行广州市分行解付德政中路二二九号汇款时，汇款人误将门牌号码写为七七九号，但由于派送员同志耐心地从七七、七九、一一九、一七九、二二九等号逐户查问，终于找到了收款人。另外一笔写为“福州南台朱崔路”的汇款，在“南京朱崔路”找到了收款人。
    为了解决侨眷因一时侨汇未到，而急需用款的困难，广东、福建、云南等省侨区的银行华侨服务部和北京等归国华侨学生较多的城市的银行华侨服务部，都举办了侨眷、归国华侨学生低利小额贷款业务。截至一九五三年年底，中国银行福建省分行就放出侨贷二十四亿元。去年五月间，仅中国银行泉州支行贷出的就有五百八十六笔。这种贷款，帮助侨胞、侨眷解决了不少困难。如福建省泉州市侨眷唐育坡四岁的儿子患了肠炎，病势危急，家中又无钱医治。中国银行泉州支行华侨服务部及时给予贷款，使孩子得到医治，恢复了健康。当银行华侨服务部工作人员前往慰问时，唐育坡的母亲说：“我的孙子是人民政府救活的，若不是银行贷款还有救吗？以前我有一个孩子，若是还在，今年十九岁了。他三岁那年生了病，无钱请医生，也没有人管，病了几天，我流着泪，看着他死了。”
  侨区银行的华侨服务部还开展了代收外币、票据和代替归国华侨、侨眷兑换外币以及代替侨胞办理投资储蓄、购买公债和保管工作。由于侨胞对华侨服务部的信任，仅福建省厦门、泉州两地，在一九五三年一年内代替侨胞保管的单据即有三千七百一十二件。不少侨胞把重要契据都交银行华侨服务部保管。在印度尼西亚泗水的一个姓郑的侨胞，除把房屋契证十余份寄交银行华侨服务部保管外，并把预立的遗嘱一并寄来。
    居住相隔数千里，长期断绝音讯的亲人，能够重获音讯、再度团圆，是十分动人的事情，也是不容易的事情，然而很多这样的故事曾发生在侨胞、侨眷中间。在抗日战争和第二次世界大战期间，由于邮路不通，人们流离失所，因此很多侨居在国外的华侨和自己在国内的眷属彼此断绝了音讯。为了帮助远隔重洋的侨胞、侨眷寻找亲人，解放以后，中国人民银行、中国银行华侨服务部就开始建立了代查亲属的工作。如住在厦门的侨眷黄锦锈的丈夫杨有志于一九三五年去仰光谋生，一九三九年后即无音讯。去年九月间黄锦锈托中国银行厦门分行华侨服务部代为寻找，经代转仰光鹭江公会协助，终于找到杨有志的下落。杨有志在一九五三年十一月回到厦门，和妻女见面了。据不完全统计，全国解放至今，各地银行华侨服务部共接受国外华侨及国内侨眷委托寻人的共一千三百三十二件。
    几年来，各地银行华侨服务部由于能够热诚地为侨胞、侨眷服务，已获得侨胞、侨眷极大信任。很多归国华侨和侨眷有事就找华侨服务部商量办理，无事也常找服务部的工作人员谈心。这些事实更加证明了“便利侨汇、服务侨胞”方针的正确，证明了中国共产党和人民政府对华侨的关怀。
