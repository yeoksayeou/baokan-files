The Second Representative Assembly of Literary and Art Workers in Beijing was held from October 25th to 28th.

Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the meeting and gave important instructions on the literary and art work in Beijing. He emphasized that creation should be encouraged, literary and art workers should be encouraged to delve into the lives of the masses engaged in socialist construction and socialist transformation, and attention should be paid to young creative forces. Zhou Yang, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, gave important instructions at the meeting on encouraging artists' creative work and conducting free discussions.

At the meeting, Lao She, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, reported on the "Work Summary of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles." After outlining the achievements and situation of the work over the past four years, he pointed out that the current literary and art creation lags behind real life, and the scope of reflection is relatively narrow. Therefore, we should still put forward the call for "creation first" today, and ask everyone to work hard in artistic practice. Wang Yaping, Secretary-General of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, made a report on "Strengthening Creative Leadership to Write More and Better Literary and Art Works." Jiao Juyin, Vice President of the Beijing People's Art Theater, and Shi Huang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, respectively made special speeches on several issues in Beijing's drama and the development of workers' literary and art work.

At the meeting, twenty-three representatives spoke enthusiastically, implementing the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and examined the work of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the creative thoughts and styles of literary and art workers. Amateur literary and art workers from Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Qinghe Woolen Mill, and construction sites requested writers to create more works reflecting industrial construction and workers' lives, and explained that workers longed for literary and art works to enrich their spiritual lives. School teachers and youth representatives also reflected in their speeches the young people's urgent desire for better and more literary and art works. Artists hoped that writers would create more scripts to satisfy their performances. Many members especially criticized the Federation of Literary and Art Circles for closing its doors to engage in professional creation groups in the past, lacking contact with members, and failing to help members improve their artistic cultivation. Wang Yaping reviewed the work of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles and his creative thoughts and styles over the past few years at the meeting.

After repeated discussions, the conference determined the future guidelines and tasks of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles: mainly organizing creation, organizing learning, and running publications. Organize literary and art workers in the capital to participate in the construction of the capital, go deep into real life, and reflect the great reality. And strengthen contact with members.

At the meeting, Lao She, Mei Lanfang, Cao Yu and other forty-five people were elected as directors of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles. (Xinhua News Agency)

(By our Inner Mongolia correspondent station) The First Representative Assembly of Literary and Art Workers of Inner Mongolia was held in Hohhot from October 20th to 27th. One hundred and five representatives from various fields such as literature, drama, music, fine arts, dance, Quyi, and folk artists in Inner Mongolia participated in the meeting.

At the meeting, the report on the Second National Representative Assembly of Literary and Art Workers was heard, and Chen Qingzhang, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Federation of Literary and Art Workers, gave a report on "Striving to Develop the Literary and Art Undertakings in Inner Mongolia," and conducted enthusiastic discussions. The representatives unanimously believed that the literary and artistic activities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the past seven years have followed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy and achieved certain results, but they are far from satisfying the ever-increasing demands of the people of all ethnic groups. Therefore, literary and art workers must continue to implement ideological transformation, strive for artistic practice, strengthen unity, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, in order to create more and better literary and artistic works for the people in the future.

At the end of the meeting, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Federation of Literary and Art Workers was officially established, and members, standing committee members, directors and deputy directors were elected.

    北京举行文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会
    内蒙古文学艺术工作者代表大会在呼和浩特市举行
    北京市文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会在十月二十五日至二十八日举行。
    中共北京市委书记彭真同志到会，对北京市文艺工作作了重要的指示。他着重指出：应当鼓舞创作，鼓舞文艺工作者深入群众的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的生活，关怀年轻的创作力量。中国文学艺术界联合会副主席周扬在会上对鼓励艺术家创造性的工作，开展自由讨论等问题作了重要的指示。
    会上，北京市文学艺术工作者联合会主席老舍报告了“北京市文学艺术工作者联合会工作总结”。他概述了四年来的工作的成就和情况之后指出：目前文艺的创作落后于现实生活，反映的面也比较狭窄。所以我们今天还应当再提出“创作第一”的号召，要求大家努力艺术实践。市文联秘书长王亚平作了“加强创作领导写出更多更好的文艺作品”的报告。北京人民艺术剧院副院长焦菊隐和北京市总工会宣传部副部长石煌分别就北京市戏剧方面的几个问题和开展工人文艺工作的问题作了专题发言。
    大会上，有二十三名代表热烈地发言，贯彻批评和自我批评的精神，检查了文联的工作和文艺工作者的创作思想、创作作风。来自石景山钢铁厂、清河制呢厂和建筑工地的业余文艺工作者发言中，要求作家更多创作出反映工业建设和工人生活的作品。并说明了工人渴望文艺作品丰富他们的精神生活。学校教员和青年代表在发言中，也反映出青年们迫切地要求有更好更多的文艺作品的心情。艺人们希望作家创作出更多的剧本，满足他们的演出。许多会员都特别批评文联过去关门搞专业的创作组，和会员缺乏联系，帮助会员提高艺术修养不够等缺点。王亚平在会上检讨了几年来市文联的工作和他的创作思想、作风。
    大会经过反复讨论后，确定了北京市文联今后的方针任务：主要是组织创作、组织学习和办好刊物。组织首都文艺工作者参加首都建设，深入实际生活，反映伟大的现实。并加强同会员的联系。
    会上选出了老舍、梅兰芳、曹禺等四十五人为市文联理事会理事。　（新华社）
    内蒙古文学艺术工作者第一次代表大会会议，于十月二十日到二十七日在呼和浩特市举行。参加这次会议的有内蒙古文学、戏剧、音乐、美术、舞蹈、曲艺和民间艺人等各方面的代表一百零五人。
    会上听取了第二次全国文学艺术工作者代表大会会议的传达报告，又听取了内蒙古自治区文学艺术工作者联合会筹备委员会副主任陈清漳“为发展内蒙古的文学艺术事业而努力”的报告，并进行了热烈的讨论。代表们一致认为，七年来内蒙古自治区的文学艺术活动，遵循着毛主席的文艺方针前进得到一定成绩，可是还远不能满足各族人民的日益增长的要求。因此，文艺工作者今后必须要继续贯彻思想改造，努力艺术的实践，加强团结，开展批评和自我批评，以求将来为人民创造更多更优秀的文学艺术作品。
    会议最后正式成立内蒙古自治区文学艺术工作者联合会，并选出委员、常务委员、主任和副主任等。　（本报内蒙古记者站）
