    PLA Commanders and Soldiers Warmly Celebrate National Day
    Commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly celebrated the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    On the eve of National Day and on National Day itself, the garrisons of various troops were decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and everywhere was filled with joy. Various troops held celebration rallies and participated in celebration gatherings and parades of the local masses. Many troops also held report meetings, celebration evenings, military-civilian get-togethers, and symposiums and other celebration activities. The newspapers, wall newspapers, and blackboard newspapers of various troops all published special issues celebrating National Day.
    Many units of the Northwest Military Region held celebration evenings and report meetings centered on "The Great Achievements of National Construction in the Past Five Years" and "We Must Liberate Taiwan." Many troops also held military sports and literary review conferences to review the glorious achievements of the troops' regular training over the past year.
    The units directly under the Southwest Military Region held a celebration rally on the eve of National Day. On the 1st, the commanders and soldiers joined the people from all walks of life in Chongqing in a National Day parade. The frontier troops guarding the southwestern border of the motherland raised the five-star red flag on National Day morning, and the commanders and soldiers unanimously expressed that they would celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the motherland with practical actions to defend the motherland's border.
    From the morning of National Day, the commanders and soldiers of the Fujian front sang "The East is Red" and "Ode to the Motherland" on every position. At the entrance of the barracks on a certain position, a tall pine gate was erected, with the couplets "Study Soviet Military Science and Build a Modern National Defense Army" and "Cross the Sea to Liberate Kinmen and Taiwan, and Accomplish the Great Cause of the People's Revolution" written on the gate. Li Xuesheng, a combat model and deputy company commander of a certain unit who had won a special merit in the cross-sea operation, inspected the various positions in the morning glow and extended holiday greetings to the soldiers. A certain coastal artillery unit that has repeatedly made meritorious service in bombing Kinmen Island pointed the muzzles of countless cannons at the islands occupied by the Chiang bandit army as soon as it dawned. When the Chiang bandit soldiers on Little Kinmen Island just climbed out under the cover of the morning mist, vainly attempting to repair the工事 (gōngshì, construction projects, fortifications) destroyed by our army, commander Yang Tinghuai immediately issued the order to "fire together," and a volley of artillery immediately blasted the Chiang bandit troops into scattered flight. The gunners applauded and cheered, saying, "Eliminate more Chiang bandit troops as a gift for National Day!" The anti-aircraft artillery unit stationed on Xiamen Island, which had shot down 15 Chiang bandit planes and wounded 41 Chiang bandit planes in the past 20 days, also used the actual action of continuously repelling more than a dozen Chiang bandit plane raids on National Day as a congratulatory gift for National Day.
    The commanders and soldiers of a certain air force unit guarding the Zhejiang East front also held celebration meetings and symposiums during the intense battle intervals. At about 3:00 p.m. on National Day, when two Chiang bandit air force F-47 aircraft had just invaded the airspace 15 kilometers south of Pishan Island in Zhejiang East, our pilots immediately took off and drove the two Chiang bandit aircraft back to the direction of Taiwan.

    解放军指战员热烈庆祝国庆节
    中国人民解放军各部队指挥员、战斗员热烈庆祝祖国建国五周年国庆节。
    国庆节前夕和国庆节这一天，各部队驻地都张灯结彩，到处喜气洋洋。各个部队都举行了庆祝大会和参加了驻地群众的庆祝集会和游行，很多部队还举行了报告会、庆祝晚会以及军民联欢会、座谈会等各种庆祝活动。各个部队的报纸、墙报、黑板报等都出版了国庆节庆祝特刊。
    西北军区许多部队都举行了庆祝晚会和以“五年来国家建设的伟大成就”、“一定要解放台湾”等为中心的报告会。许多部队还举行了军事体育和文艺检阅大会，检阅了一年来部队正规训练的光辉成就。
    西南军区直属机关部队在国庆节前夕举行了庆祝大会。一日，指战员们又和重庆市各界人民共同举行了国庆节游行。守卫祖国西南边防的前哨部队，在国庆节清晨就升起了五星红旗，指战员们一致表示：要以保卫祖国边疆的实际行动来庆祝祖国建国五周年。
    福建前线各部队的指战员们，从国庆节清晨起，每个阵地上都欢唱起“东方红”、“歌唱祖国”的歌声。在某阵地上的营房门口，扎着高大的松门，松门上写着“学习苏联军事科学，建设现代化国防军”和“跨海解放金门台湾，完成人民革命大业”的对联。曾在渡海作战中荣立特等功的某部战斗模范、副连长李学胜，在晨曦中巡视了各个阵地，向战士们做节日的祝贺。在轰击金门岛战斗中屡建功勋的某海防炮兵部队，天刚亮就把无数门大炮的炮口指向蒋贼军窃踞的岛屿。当小金门岛上的蒋贼军士兵借着晨雾的掩护刚刚爬出来妄图修补被我军打毁了的工事时，指挥员杨廷槐立刻发出了“齐放”的口令，一阵排炮当即炸得蒋匪军四散窜逃。炮手们都鼓掌欢呼说：“消灭更多的蒋贼军来作国庆的贺礼啊！”最近二十天中曾连续打落蒋贼飞机十五架、打伤蒋贼飞机四十一架的驻厦门岛的高射炮部队也在国庆节这天用连接击退十多架次蒋贼飞机的袭扰的实际行动，来做为对国庆节的祝贺。
    守卫在浙东前线的某空军部队的指战员们也在紧张的战斗空隙中举行了庆祝会和座谈会。国庆节下午三时许，当两架蒋贼空军F—四七型飞机刚侵入我浙东披山岛以南十五公里上空时，我军飞行员们立即起飞把这两架蒋贼飞机赶回台湾方向去了。
