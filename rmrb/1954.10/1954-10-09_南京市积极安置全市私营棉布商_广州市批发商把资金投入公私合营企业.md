Nanjing Actively Resettles Private Cotton Cloth Merchants Throughout the City
Guangzhou Wholesalers Invest Funds in Joint Public-Private Enterprises

The Nanjing Municipal People's Government is actively conducting city-wide resettlement of private cotton cloth merchants.

Of the four private cotton cloth wholesalers in Nanjing, two have been assisted by the government to change professions, one has switched to retail, and one is preparing to change professions. Of the 97 retail shop owners throughout the city, 75 have become distribution stores for the state-owned Cotton, Yarn & Fabric Company, 12 have merged with the state-owned Cotton, Yarn & Fabric Company's cotton cloth distribution stores, and six have currently registered their inventory, formulated plans, and been approved by the government to first purchase from the state-owned Cotton, Yarn & Fabric Company with vouchers and continue business. In addition, four have applied to close down and have been approved by the government because they can find other ways to make a living. Of the 102 cotton cloth stall vendors throughout the city, apart from the eight who can find other ways to make a living and have voluntarily applied for and been approved to close down, the rest will first purchase cloth from the state-owned Cotton, Yarn & Fabric Company with vouchers according to the state-approved plan, and continue business according to the prices stipulated by the state.

After the private cotton cloth retailers established distribution relationships with the state-owned Cotton, Yarn & Fabric Company, the enthusiasm of the store employees greatly increased. In general, they further improved their service attitude and urged the capitalists to improve their management style. After the private cotton cloth retail stores sold cloth at prices stipulated by the state, the prices were generally 3% to 5% lower than in the past, and the phenomenon of unreasonable prices was basically overcome. Some private cotton cloth retailers have changed their management style after becoming distributors. Deceptive practices such as raising prices, selling inferior goods as superior ones, and shortchanging customers have decreased, thus gaining the trust of consumers. A customer who bought cloth at Tianxing Cloth Store said, "Now that the government has unified cloth prices, we don't have to go to the state-owned stores in the city center to buy a few feet of cloth." The Phoenix Cloth Store has also gained many new customers.

Since the beginning of this year, 70 private wholesalers in Guangzhou have invested approximately 40 billion yuan in existing or planned joint public-private enterprises in Guangzhou. A total of 24 wholesalers, with a capital of about 15 billion yuan, invested all the funds from their stores in existing joint public-private enterprises such as the South China Enterprise Co., Ltd. and the South China Bamboo Industry Co., Ltd. The aforementioned two joint public-private enterprises are using these funds to expand their factories and actively expand their business operations. Forty-one wholesalers in the new medicine, cotton yarn, and silk fabric industries have invested more than 19 billion yuan in the joint public-private Guangzhou Refrigeration Depot and Ice Factory, which are under construction. In addition, five wholesalers have invested more than 4 billion yuan in the joint public-private Guangming Company to build two cinemas. One of them is being built in the Henan District, which previously had no cinemas, and will soon be completed. The employees of all these businesses that have changed industries have mostly transferred to work in joint public-private enterprises along with the funds, and the rest have been or will be appropriately resettled by state-owned commercial departments.

    南京市积极安置全市私营棉布商
    广州市批发商把资金投入公私合营企业
    南京市人民政府积极地对私营棉布商进行全行业的安置。
    南京全市四户私营棉布批发商，两户已由政府协助转业，一户转营零售，一户正在筹备转业。全市九十七户零售座商已有七十五户成为国营花纱布公司的经销店，有十二户和国营花纱布公司的棉布经销店合并，有六户目前已登记库存，编制计划并经政府批准，先凭证向国营花纱布公司批购，继续营业；另外，因能另谋出路，自动申请歇业并经政府批准的有四户。全市一百零二户棉布摊贩，除可另谋出路，自动申请并经政府批准歇业的八户外，其余都先按照国家批准的计划，凭证到国营花纱布公司批购布匹，按照国家规定的价格继续营业。
    私营棉布零售商和国营花纱布公司建立经销关系以后，店员工人积极性大为提高，一般都进一步改善了服务态度，并督促资本家改善经营作风。私营棉布零售店按照国家规定的价格出售布匹以后，价格一般比过去降低了百分之三到百分之五，价格不合理的现象基本上得到克服。有些私营棉布零售商经销以后，经营作风已有改变，像过去那样的抬高价格、以次充好、短少尺码等欺骗顾客的行为已经减少，因而获得了消费者的信任。一个到天兴布店买布的顾客说：“政府统一布价以后，我们要买几尺布，就不用到市中心区国营商店去买了。”凤凰号布店也增加了不少新顾客。
    广州市今年以来，已有七十户私营批发商把约四百亿元的资金投入广州市原有的公私合营企业或正在筹建的公私合营企业。把商店的全部资金投入原有的华南企业股份有限公司和华南竹业股份有限公司等公私合营企业的批发商共有二十四家，资金约一百五十多亿元。前述两个公私合营企业正利用这些资金扩充工厂和积极扩大经营业务。新药和棉纱绸布等行业的四十一户批发商，已把资金一百九十多亿元投入正在筹建的公私合营广州冷藏库和制冰厂。此外，还有五户批发商，向公私合营光明公司投资四十多亿元，兴建两个电影院。其中一个建立在过去没有电影院的河南区，不久就可落成。所有这些转业商户的从业人员，绝大部分已随资金一道转入公私合营企业工作，其余的亦已由或将由国营商业部门予以适当安置。　（新华社）
