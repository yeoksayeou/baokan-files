Beirut Delegation Leader's Speech at the Airport

Dear comrades and friends:

    During the Polish government delegation's stay in the People's Republic of China, we received brotherly and warm hospitality everywhere. As we leave your beautiful and great country, we would like to express our deep gratitude for this. We had the opportunity to admire your magnificent historical sites and works of art, which show that the Chinese people have great cultural traditions and unparalleled talents. We were extremely excited to see the tremendous creative achievements made by the Chinese working people in the five years since they smashed the shackles of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. We visited your factories that were rebuilt and newly built after liberation, where the work of realizing the industrialization of your country and gradually building a solid foundation for socialism is being carried out. We also saw Chinese farmers organizing mutual aid teams and developing agricultural producers' cooperatives with unparalleled labor enthusiasm and creative spirit.

    The many facts we have seen show that Chinese youth have a high degree of labor enthusiasm and a noble spirit of learning, and that Chinese intellectuals love their motherland. Everything we have seen with our own eyes convinces us that the Chinese people, who are building a new life and a new social system under the wise leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, have great strength and a bright future.

    The great historical achievements of the liberated Chinese people have become a powerful factor influencing the balance of international forces, inspiring the Asian people to fight for peace and freedom, and strengthening the forces of the world peace and progress camp.

    Like all countries liberated from the shackles of capitalism, the source of the ever-growing strength of the People's Republic of China lies in the ideological unity of the Chinese working people, and in the ideological consistency of the Chinese Communist Party, which is loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and guides itself forward with the historical experience of the great Soviet Union, the world's first socialist country, which gives China brotherly assistance. The Polish People's Republic will redouble its efforts to deepen the friendship with the great Chinese people and strengthen the economic, cultural cooperation and friendly relations between our two countries.

    Dear friends, please allow me to wish your country further prosperity, greater development in economic and cultural construction, and continuous improvement in the welfare of the working people.

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Polish People's Republic!
    Long live the victory in the struggle for world peace!

    贝鲁特团长在机场上的讲话亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    波兰政府代表团在中华人民共和国逗留期间，在各地受到了兄弟般的热情款待；在离开你们美丽和伟大的国家的时候，我们对此谨表示深切的感谢。我们曾获有机会欣赏你们的壮丽的古迹和艺术作品，它们显示出中国人民是具有伟大的文化传统和无比的才能的。我们看到了中国劳动人民在粉碎半封建半殖民地的枷锁之后五年来所取得的巨大的创造性成就，因而感到异常兴奋。我们参观了你们在解放后重建和新建的工厂，你们国家实现工业化和逐步建设社会主义稳固基础的工作，就是在这些工厂里进行着的。我们还看到了中国的农民正以无比的劳动热情和创造精神组织互助组和发展农业生产合作社。
    我们见到的许多事实，说明中国的青年具有高度的劳动热情和崇高的学习精神，说明中国的知识分子热爱自己的祖国。我们亲眼看到的一切，使我们深信，在英勇的中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志的英明领导下的、正在建设新生活和新的社会制度的中国人民，具有伟大的力量和光明的前途。
    解放了的中国人民伟大的历史性成就已经成为影响国际力量的对比关系，鼓舞亚洲人民争取和平与自由，以及加强世界和平与进步阵营力量的强大因素。
    正如所有从资本主义枷锁下解放出来的国家一样，中华人民共和国不断增长的力量的泉源在于中国劳动人民的思想一致，在于忠实于马列主义原则并用世界上第一个社会主义国家即给中国以兄弟般帮助的伟大苏联的历史经验来指导自己前进的中国共产党在思想上的一致。波兰人民共和国将加倍努力加深对于伟大的中国人民的友谊，密切我们两国之间的经济、文化合作和友好关系。
    亲爱的朋友们，请允许我祝你们的国家进一步繁荣，经济和文化建设事业更加发展，劳动人民的福利不断提高。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中华人民共和国和波兰人民共和国之间的友谊万岁！
    为争取世界和平的斗争胜利万岁！
