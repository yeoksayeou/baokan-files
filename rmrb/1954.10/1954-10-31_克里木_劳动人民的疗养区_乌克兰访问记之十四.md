    Crimea – A Sanatorium for the Working People – Notes from a Visit to Ukraine – XIV
    By Our Correspondent Li He

    “Where are you going for vacation?”
    “I’m going to Crimea for vacation.”

    In Ukraine's workshops, mines, schools, and stores, such conversations can be heard everywhere.

    The Moscow-Simferopol line, the Kharkov-Simferopol line – trains, cars, and planes are daily filled with laborers taking their annual vacations to Crimea.

    Crimea, located in the south of Ukraine, is a diamond-shaped peninsula bordering the Black Sea. Not long ago, it was transferred from the jurisdiction of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. This is because, in terms of economic commonality, geographical convenience, and administrative and cultural ties, the Crimean Oblast is closer to the Ukrainian Republic. This event demonstrates the traditional friendship between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples. In feudal or capitalist societies, which cultivate national hatred, such a thing would be unimaginable. But in a socialist society, it is handled so naturally and rationally, just like dealing with the issue of national languages. In Ukraine, before the October Revolution, three-quarters of the residents were illiterate; now, everyone is literate. Thousands of Ukrainian and Russian newspapers and magazines are published, and almost every oblast has newspapers in both languages simultaneously. Ukraine currently has over 30,000 primary and secondary schools. Every district and locality has schools that teach in Ukrainian or Russian. Children of residents, whether Ukrainian or Russian, can attend school freely. However, Ukrainian-language schools begin teaching Russian from the fourth grade, and Russian-language schools begin teaching Ukrainian from the fourth grade.

    The train carried us from Kharkov to Simferopol, the center of the Crimean Oblast. Simferopol is like a welcoming gateway, where people transfer to various parts of the peninsula. We changed to cars and went to Yevpatoria on the western coast and Yalta on the southern coast. They are two of the best sanatorium locations in Crimea. Those forbidden areas and villas that belonged to the Tsar, nobles, landlords, and capitalists before the October Revolution were allocated to the working people for their enjoyment, according to Lenin's instructions, after the Soviet Red Army defeated Wrangel and the White bandits. The southern climate, the Black Sea coast, the sanatoriums and rest homes left from the old days and newly built during the Soviet era – all these make Crimea a sanatorium area for the Soviet working people.

    In Yevpatoria, we cruised along the open coast by boat. In the early morning, soft sunlight enveloped the calm sea, as if smoke had risen. The blue Black Sea water here is very different from what we saw in Sochi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea two years ago, where the unobstructed deeper water stirred up larger waves. The seawater in Yevpatoria is very shallow, and the coast stretches into a vast, flat sandy beach, known as the "Golden Beach." Many children, large and small, were jumping and swimming in the water. This is a suitable place for children's sanatoriums.

    Along the coast, a straight tree-lined road connects many sanatoriums. Yevpatoria currently has twenty-three sanatoriums and one rest home, thirteen of which are children's sanatoriums, and two children's and one adult sanatorium are under construction. We went to the "Striker" Sanatorium. It is run by the Soviet Ministry of Health and was a capitalist's villa before the revolution. It has three hundred beds, accommodating workers, staff, farmers, students, and teachers from Donbas, Kiev, Moscow, the Far East, the North, and all over the Soviet Union. They are cared for by fifteen specialists. A proper living system and well-equipped X-ray rooms, electrotherapy rooms, physiotherapy rooms, massage rooms, as well as seawater baths, sunbaths, air baths, and so on, help them quickly recover their health during a one- to two-month vacation.

    The Krupskaya Children's Sanatorium makes one admire the care of socialist countries for children. This sanatorium specializes in treating and educating children with bone tuberculosis. Thousands of children have been cured and educated here and have gone out to become useful members of society. The director, Vladimir Ilyich Kositsky, said: In capitalist countries, children with bone tuberculosis have a hard time surviving; in the Soviet Union, they have their own hope and future. Kositsky has worked in the sanatorium for twenty-two years. He is respected by society and was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Under his leadership, the sanatorium has three deputy directors in charge of medical care, education, and economy, respectively; eleven doctors, ten teachers (with higher education), and sixteen instructors. A total of one hundred and sixty-five staff members serve two hundred hospitalized children from all over the country.

    The children live in separate wards according to their age. These wards are spacious, bright, and well-ventilated corridors. The Black Sea is right in front of the wards. Some children have plaster casts on their backs, arms, legs, or knees. Most of them are lying in bed, but some are recovering and can sit and walk. Some are reading, some are playing the piano, some are playing chess. Although they have been lying down for several years, they are in good spirits. Nikolai Ostrovsky, the author of "How the Steel Was Tempered," once stayed in Yevpatoria for treatment. His perseverance clearly influenced these younger generations. They enjoy the sunlight, air, seawater, as well as medical treatment with medicine, food, and physical exercise. Bone tuberculosis takes several years to heal. While receiving treatment, they study in classes and take the same courses as regular middle schools. Many children complete their tenth-grade studies, their illnesses are cured, they grow up, and they enter universities or participate in labor. Ninety-seven percent of the children study well. It seems that studying is beneficial for improving the knowledge and boosting the morale of long-term patients.

    Leaving Yevpatoria, we took the road back through Simferopol, traversing more than ninety kilometers of winding mountain roads to Yalta. The mountains are covered with towering trees, such as Crimean pine, juniper, beech, and oak. It is said that about 3,500 species of plants grow in the European part of the Soviet Union, and 2,000 species grow in Crimea. The road detours to Alushta by the sea, where there are also good beaches and many sanatoriums, with the miners' sanatorium being the most beautiful. The road then turns back up the mountain. As we descended, we could see the magnificent and boundless bright blue Black Sea and the Yalta Bay surrounded by two mountain feet. Ships to Odessa and Batumi were docked at the pier there.

    Yalta is backed by mountains and faces the sea. The mountains block the north wind, and the Black Sea regulates the temperature. The climate is mild and sunny. People who like to swim, people with weak respiratory organs and nervous systems, all like to come to Yalta.

    Sanatorium institutions make up the city of Yalta. From the seaside to the hillside, sanatoriums are everywhere. Sanatoriums work year-round. Thousands of people are resting there every period. Near noon, along the coast, countless people were swimming in the clear, see-through water. In the evening, on the palm-lined seaside avenue, in the shady parks, laborers from various sanatoriums crowded together for a stroll. Before the October Revolution, ordinary workers and peasants were forbidden from entering Yalta.

    On the hillside in a place called Livadia, we arrived at a large sanatorium. It is run by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. This white stone building was originally the villa of the last Tsar of Russia. The famous Crimean Conference (Yalta Conference) of February 1945 was held here. The halls and rooms originally used for the meeting are now used to serve the recuperating workers. This sanatorium has four hundred and fifty beds. There are Chinese and Korean students recuperating there.

    A Soviet female comrade recuperating in Yalta talked about her day in the sanatorium. At 7:00 a.m., accompanied by the accordion, older people began morning exercises. Young people ran to the beach for morning exercises in the fresh sea breeze. Then they lay flat on the wooden beds in the bathing area, letting the soft sunlight caress their bodies, listening to the rushing waves, quietly watching the mirror-like sea surface, when the sunlight has not yet penetrated the depths of the sea, and the sea water has not yet changed from dark blue to bright blue. After breakfast from 9:00 to 10:00, people go to the bathing area again for two to three hours of sunbathing. During this time, doctors patrol and guide with nurses. Every five minutes, a bell rings in the bathing area to remind everyone to turn over to avoid sunburn. The nurses tell everyone when to go to the awning for an air bath - to let the skin and pores of the whole body contact the fresh air. At eleven o'clock, the southern sun is a bit scorching. Most people run into the sea water, or lie next to the sea water, accepting the splashing of the waves. At twelve o'clock, when the sun is at its peak, people who can swim swim happily, or rise and fall with the waves, or lie on their backs on the water. People who are not very good at swimming also play in shallow water. When white waves rise on the sea, the broadcasting on the bathing area summons people to leave the sea. Lunch from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. From 3:00 to 4:00 is Yalta's quiet time. Radio broadcasts cease, and all recuperating people fall asleep. After the afternoon nap, the cultural and entertainment worker announces the travel and cultural entertainment plan for the most recent period. People take two buses provided by the sanatorium to travel to places of interest. After returning from the trip, it is already 8:00, the time to eat dinner. In the evening, some people go to see movies, some go to dance, and some go to visit neighboring sanatoriums according to the customs of Crimea. People who want to see the night view of Yalta take a walk to the seaside road. All recuperating personnel return to bed before 11:30 p.m. Seawater baths, sunbaths, air baths, travel, entertainment, and some drug treatments for sick people - this whole set of recuperation systems greatly enhances the physique of workers in less than a month.

    In Yevpatoria, in Yalta, as in other sanatoriums in the Soviet Union, there are many whole families recuperating. We met many people on trains and ships taking their families to Crimea. One or two people in a family get a recuperation ticket and recuperate in the sanatorium. The rest of the people do not have recuperation tickets and live near the sanatorium for recuperation. They solve their own food and lodging problems. Municipal hospitals serve them. The number of people recuperating outside the organization is very large every year.

    On the way back to Simferopol from Yalta, we detoured to Artek. This is a Soviet Young Pioneer sanatorium camp. Over a period of twenty-nine years, this sanatorium camp on the Black Sea coast has received many children from the Soviet Union itself, as well as from China and other countries. Those who are sent there are children who are excellent in both studies and social work. Swimming, boating, climbing, traveling, campfires, games, forty days of lively life and collectivist education, leave a deep impression on the children. Now Artek has four camps, three of which work year-round, and one of which works in the summer, with thousands of children recuperating every period.

    Crimea has one hundred and sixty-three sanatoriums and rest homes, of which one hundred and nineteen are scattered on the south coast. Every year, tens of thousands of workers spend their vacations here, enjoying the right to rest guaranteed by the Constitution.

    In Crimea, we ended a month-long visit to Ukraine. A direct flight took us back from Simferopol to Moscow. At 2:00 p.m., we were still in the center of Crimea, and at 6:00 p.m., we were already seeing the red star of the Kremlin and the buildings of Moscow University from the air again. When the plane passed over Ukraine, I took a bird's-eye view of Ukraine's beautiful mountains and rivers through the small window from time to time with a reluctant mood. How strong, prosperous, and happy the 42 million Ukrainian people have built the republic under the leadership of the Communist Party, under the socialist system, and in the united and friendly family of all nationalities in the Soviet Union!

    克里木——劳动人民的疗养区——乌克兰访问记之十四
    本报记者　李何
    “上哪儿休假去？”
    “上克里木休假去。”
    在乌克兰的车间、矿井、学校、商店，到处听得见这样的对话。
    莫斯科—辛费罗波尔线，哈尔科夫—辛费罗波尔线的火车、汽车、飞机，每日满载一年一度休假的劳动者到克里木去。
    克里木，在乌克兰南面，是滨临黑海的菱形半岛。不久之前它从俄罗斯联邦共和国管辖划给乌克兰共和国管辖。因为就经济的共同性、地理的方便、行政和文化的联系来说，克里木州却更接近于乌克兰共和国。这件事表现了俄罗斯和乌克兰两大民族的传统友谊。在封建或资本主义那种培植民族仇恨的社会里，这种事情是不可想像的。但在社会主义社会里，它却处理得这么自然、合理，就好像处理民族语言问题一样。在乌克兰，在十月革命以前，居民四分之三是文盲，现在全识字了；出版着上千种乌克兰文和俄罗斯文的报纸和杂志，差不多每州都同时有这两种文字的州报。乌克兰现有三万多所初级和中级学校。每区每地同时设有用乌克兰语或俄罗斯语教授的学校。居民子女，不论乌克兰人还是俄罗斯人，随便入学。但乌克兰语的学校从四年级起要教俄罗斯语，俄罗斯语学校从四年级起要教乌克兰语。
    火车把我们从哈尔科夫载到克里木州中心辛费罗波尔。辛费罗波尔像迎接来客的大门，人们都经过那里转到半岛的各地去。我们换乘汽车，先后到了半岛西面海边的叶甫帕托里亚和南面海边的雅尔塔。它们是克里木两个最好的疗养地。那些十月革命前属于沙皇、贵族、大地主、大资本家的禁地和别墅，在苏联红军击败佛兰格尔和白匪以后，根据列宁的指令，都拨归劳动人民享用了。南方的气候，黑海的海滨，旧日留下的和在苏维埃政权时期新建的疗养所和休养所，这一切使克里木成为苏联劳动人民的疗养区。
    在叶甫帕托里亚，我们乘艇在开阔的海滨巡游。清晨，柔和的阳光笼罩在平静的海面，犹如升起了烟雾。蓝色的黑海海水在这里迥然不同于我们前年在黑海东岸索琪所见的，那里无遮拦的较深的海水掀起较大的浪涛。叶甫帕托里亚的海水很浅，海滨伸展着广阔平坦的沙滩，被称为“黄金浴场”。许多大大小小的儿童在水里蹦跳和游泳。这是适宜儿童疗养的地方。
    沿着海边，一条笔直的林荫路把许多疗养所联接起来。叶甫帕托里亚现有二十三个疗养所和一个休养所，其中十三个是儿童疗养所，正在建筑两个儿童的和一个大人的疗养所。我们到了“突击队员”疗养所。它是苏联卫生部办的，在革命前是资本家的别墅。三百张床位，休养着从顿巴斯、基也辅、莫斯科、远东、北方和全苏联各地来的工人、职员、庄员、学生、教员。他们受到十五位专科医生的照料。适当的生活制度和设备周全的X光室、电疗室、理疗室、按摩室，以及海水浴、日光浴、空气浴等等。帮助他们在一个月到两个月的假期内迅速恢复健康。
    以克鲁普斯卡雅为名的儿童疗养所，使人不能不赞叹社会主义国家对儿童的关怀。这个疗养所专门治疗和教育患骨结核病的儿童。已经有几千儿童在这里医好病、受了教育，出去成为社会上有用成员。所长弗拉季米尔·伊里奇·科西茨基说：在资本主义国家，患骨结核病的儿童是很难有生路的；在苏联，他们有自己的希望和前途。科西茨基在疗养所已经工作二十二年。他受到社会的尊敬，被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。在他的领导下，全所有三个副所长，分别管医疗、教育和经济；十一个医生，十个教员（受过高等教育）十六个训育员。全所一百六十五个工作人员为全国各地来的二百个住院的儿童服务。
    儿童们按年龄大小，分住在各个病房。这些病房都是宽敞、明亮、空气流通的走廊。黑海就在病房的跟前。儿童们有的在背上、有的在臂上、在腿上、在膝上夹住石膏板。绝大部分都躺在床上，也有快痊愈能坐能走的。有读书的，有弹琴的，有下棋的，虽然一躺好几年，精神都很愉快。“钢铁是怎样炼成的”作者奥斯特罗夫斯基曾经在叶甫帕托里亚疗养过。他的坚毅精神显然影响到这些后辈身上。他们享用着阳光、空气、海水，以及药物、食品、体育的医疗。骨结核病需要几年的时间才治疗得好。与治疗的同时，他们分班学习，和普通中学进修同样的功课。不少儿童修完十年级学业，病也医好了，人也长大了，进了高等学校或者参加劳动。儿童百分之九十七都学习得不错。看起来，学习对于提高长期患病者的知识和鼓舞他们的情绪，都有好处。
    离了叶甫帕托里亚，我们又取道辛费罗波尔，翻越九十多公里蜿蜒曲折的山岭公路，走向雅尔塔。山岭长着参天的高大树木，如像克里木松、杜松、山毛榉、橡。据说，在苏联欧洲部分长有约三千五百种植物，在克里木就长有二千种。公路中途折到海边亚卢什塔，那里也有好浴场和许多疗养所，以矿工的疗养所为最漂亮。公路再折向山上。下山时已经望见雄伟无边的鲜蓝的黑海和两个山脚环抱着的雅尔塔海湾。那里码头边停泊着通往奥德萨和巴土米的轮船。
    雅尔塔背山面海。山岭挡住北风，黑海调节着寒暖。气候柔和、晴朗。爱好游泳的人们，呼吸器官和神经系统衰弱的人们，都喜欢到雅尔塔来。
    疗养机关构成了雅尔塔城市。从海边到山坡，遍布着疗养所。疗养所长年工作。每期休养着数以千计的人们。近午，沿着海岸，无数人们在澄清可以见底的水中游泳。傍晚，在棕榈成行的滨海大路上，在绿荫的公园里，拥挤着从各个疗养所出来蹓跶的劳动者。而在十月革命	普通工人和农民是被禁止进入雅尔塔的。
    在山坡上名叫李瓦治亚地方，我们到了一座很大的疗养所。它是全苏工会中央理事会办的。这座白石建筑物，原是俄国最后一个沙皇的别墅。一九四五年二月有名的克里木会议（雅尔塔会议），就是在这里举行的。原来会议用的厅和室，现在利用来为疗养的劳动者服务了。这个疗养所有四百五十个床位。有中国和朝鲜的留学生在那里休养。
    一位在雅尔塔疗养的苏联女同志谈了她在疗养所的一日。上午七点，在手风琴伴奏下，年龄大的人们开始早操。青年们跑到海边，在新鲜的海风中早操。然后平躺在浴场的木床上，让柔和的阳光抚摩身体，凝听哗啦啦的海涛，静看镜子似的海面，这时阳光还没有穿透海的深处，海水还没有从暗蓝色变成鲜蓝色。九点到十点早饭后，人们再到浴场进行两三个小时的日光浴。在这时间内，医生带着护士巡视和指导。浴场上每五分钟响一次铃，提醒大家翻翻身，免得晒伤了皮肤。护士们告诉大家什么时候到围篷里去进行空气浴——让全身皮肤和毛孔接触新鲜空气。十一点，南方的太阳有点灼人。大部分人跑到海水中去，或者躺在海水旁边，接受浪花的溅沫。十二点，太阳当顶的时候，会游泳的人们畅快地游着，或者随浪起伏，或者仰卧在水面。不大会游泳的人们也在浅水地方玩着。当海面起了白浪时候，浴场上的广播便召唤人们离开了海。下午两点到三点中饭。三点到四点是雅尔塔的肃静时刻。无线电广播停息了，所有疗养的人们入睡了。午睡起来以后，文化娱乐工作员宣布最近一个时期的旅行和文化娱乐计划。人们乘着疗养所自备的两辆公共汽车，到名胜旅行去了。旅行回来，已经是八点该吃晚饭的时刻。晚间，有些人看电影去，有些人跳舞去，有些人按照克里木的习惯到邻近疗养所作客去。想看雅尔塔夜景的人们，散步到海滨路去。所有疗养人员在晚上十一点半钟前回来就寝。海水浴、日光浴、空气浴、旅行、娱乐，以及对有病的人的某些药物治疗，这一整套疗养制度使劳动者在不到一个月期间大大增强了体质。
    在叶甫帕托里亚，在雅尔塔，正如在苏联其他的疗养地，有许多全家休养的。我们在火车上，轮船上，碰见了不少人携家去克里木。一家人当中一两个人得到疗养券，在疗养所休养。其余的人没有疗养券，住在疗养所附近休养。他们自己解决食宿问题。市立的医院为他们服务。这种不在组织以内的休养人们的数目，每年很多。
    从雅尔塔回到辛费罗波尔的路途中，折到了亚尔德克。这是苏联少先队员疗养营。在二十九年期间，这个黑海南岸的疗养营，接待了许多苏联自己以及中国和各国的儿童。被送到那里的，都是学习和社会工作兼优的儿童。游泳、划船、爬山、旅行、营火、游戏，四十天的活泼生活和集体主义教育，留给儿童们深刻的印象。现在亚尔德克有四个营，其中三个常年工作，一个在夏季工作，一期休养着上千的儿童。
    克里木有一百六十三个疗养所和休养所，其中
  一百十九个散布在南岸。每年成千成万劳动者在这里度着自己的假期，享受着宪法所保证的休息权利。
    在克里木，我们结束了一个月的乌克兰访问。直达班机把我们从辛费罗波尔载回到莫斯科。下午两点，我们还在克里木中心，下午六点，我们已经从空中再见克里姆林宫的红星和莫斯科大学的大厦了。飞机经过乌克兰上空时，我带着惜别的心情，不时通过小窗鸟瞰了乌克兰的锦绣山川。四千二百万的乌克兰人民，在共产党领导下，在社会主义制度下，在苏联各民族团结友好的大家庭中，把共和国建设得多么强盛、繁荣和幸福呵！
