Chongqing: Forty factories and mines, responding to the call of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, have successively launched in-depth labor competitions since the beginning of October, striving to ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan. After inspecting the serious situation of Factory 101’s failure to complete the state plan for a long period from January to August, the Party Committee of Factory 101, in view of the problems in production, convened a factory-wide production technology conference and a workers' congress to discuss and formulate more than 90 technical measures to ensure the completion of the state plan, and decided to further implement the eight major advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. The steelmaking and steel rail workshops and other departments have put forward conditions to ensure the completion of tasks. In the safety production competition, the No. 3 shift group of the 507 Power Plant guaranteed that no liability accidents or operational accidents would occur in the fourth quarter. In addition to ensuring the completion of the overhaul task, the boiler workshop repair team also took time to repair the drainage ditch of the coal unloading pit, which made the raw coal dry and convenient for combustion. Workers of the 612 Textile Factory, focusing on issues such as improving quality, saving cotton, and reducing costs, each workshop group discussed the competition targets in detail. The cloth field workers implemented the 1951 weaving work method, which improved quality and saved yarn. (Report from Sichuan Reporter Station of this newspaper)

    重庆市四十个厂矿深入开展劳动竞赛
    重庆四十个厂矿响应中共重庆市委号召，自进入十月以来先后深入开展劳动竞赛，正为保证全面完成国家计划而努力。一零一厂党委在检查该厂一至八月长期完不成国家计划的严重情况后，针对生产中的问题，召开全厂生产技术会议和职工大会，讨论、制订了保证完成国家计划的九十多项技术措施，并决定进一步贯彻苏联的八大先进经验；炼钢、钢轨等车间和其他科室，都提出了保证完成任务的条件。五零七发电厂在开展安全生产竞赛中，第三运转小组保证在第四季度内不发生任何责任事故和操作事故，锅炉车间修理班除保证完成检修任务外，并抽出时间修通卸煤坑的排水沟，使原煤干燥便利燃烧。六一二纺织厂工人围绕提高品质、节约用棉、降低成本等问题，各车间小组均详细讨论了竞赛指标；布场工人贯彻一九五一织布工作法，提高了质量，节约了用纱。（本报四川记者站）
