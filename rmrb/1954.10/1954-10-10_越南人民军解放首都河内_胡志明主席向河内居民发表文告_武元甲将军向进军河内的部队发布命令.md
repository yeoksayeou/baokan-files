Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 9th: The Vietnamese People's Army entered Hanoi today (September 9th), a city filled with red flags and cheers. The capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, occupied by French forces for nearly eight years, has been liberated.

In accordance with the Geneva Conference agreements and the specific agreements of the Phù Lỗ meeting, the Vietnamese People's Army began entering Hanoi at 6:00 AM on the 9th. From the same time, French troops began withdrawing section by section. The handover progressed from the offices and residential areas in the west and south of Hanoi towards the commercial area in the northeast. The vanguard of the Vietnamese People's Army, transported by trucks, orderly took over the original Hanoi City Government, the French Governor-General's Palace, and the Office of the Chief of North Vietnam (office of the North Vietnamese Chairman of the Bảo Đại government) before noon. The golden star red flag also flew high above prominent buildings such as the Hanoi Railway Station, the Hanoi Opera House, and the Vietnam University (formerly "Hanoi University").

Wherever cadres of the Vietnamese People's Army and the Hanoi Military and Administrative Committee of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government arrived, residences and shops eagerly hung bright national flags and opened their doors to welcome them. When a unit of the Vietnamese People's Army arrived at the power company to take over guard duties, the employees warmly welcomed them, offering flowers to the soldiers as a sign of respect. The remaining employees busily worked in the workshops, keeping the machines running as usual. The water company also continued to supply water to the entire city without interruption.

The liberated people poured into the streets, jubilantly cheering to the troops and government staff: "Long live a peaceful, unified, independent, and democratic Vietnam!" "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!"

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, September 9th: On October 8th, cadres of the Vietnamese People's Army and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam orderly received the vast suburbs outside the Lo Giang dyke of Hanoi from the French Federation forces, including Bạch Mai Airport in the south and dozens of markets and villages in the suburbs.

At 11:30 AM on the 8th, three units of the Vietnamese People's Army advanced towards Hanoi from three wide and flat roads in the south, southwest, and west in the rain. Soldiers held high the huge golden star red flags, one team after another. Golden star red flags were also hung in the green villages along the way. Farmers and small market vendors crowded along both sides of the road to welcome their troops in the rain. Elderly people holding umbrellas had hoarse voices from shouting slogans, young mothers waved their small hands to the soldiers with their babies in their arms, and everyone greeted each team of soldiers with enthusiastic cheers and applause. The soldiers smiled and waved back as they marched. For more than two months, the troops of the Ngô Đình Diệm group had maliciously slandered the Vietnamese People's Army in front of these men and women, old and young, but today people were so enthusiastic and carefree, crowding together to leave only a narrow path for the soldiers to pass, warmly welcoming them to liberate themselves, and excitedly sending them off as they marched towards Hanoi.

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, September 9th: President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a proclamation to the residents of Hanoi on the occasion of the liberation of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The proclamation said: In the past eight years, the government had to leave the capital to resist the war and save the country. Despite this separation, the government has always been mindful of the compatriots in the capital.

Today, thanks to the unity of our people and the heroic fighting of our army, peace has been restored. Now, the government has returned to the capital and is with you. Because we are members of the same family, our joy is indescribable.

The proclamation said: Since World War II, Hanoi has experienced more than ten years of war. This period has been quite long, and the losses have been enormous. The capital has remained as it is now entirely due to the active struggle you have waged. However, our government and people should work together in the future to restore, consolidate, and develop the spiritual and material life of our capital.

The proclamation pointed out: Our government and people should work together to maintain law and order. At the same time, we must jointly launch a campaign of "diligence, thrift, integrity, and uprightness" and a campaign to maintain good attitudes and habits.

We must implement the government's economic policies, give sufficient care to state-owned and private enterprises, and benefit both labor and capital. Workers should enthusiastically participate in production. Business people should actively manage their enterprises. We must maintain and restore all production, trade, economic, and financial activities in our capital.

The government and parents should work together so that our children can continue their studies. Cultural and educational workers should serve the people actively. We must maintain and restore all cultural activities.

From a political point of view, we must unite closely to achieve democratic freedom. Everyone should do their best to restore the capital and build a peaceful, unified, independent, and democratic Vietnam.

In short, our people, army, and cadres must correctly implement policies and abide by the discipline promulgated by the Hanoi People's Military and Administrative Committee.

The proclamation also said to foreigners: You have been living with the Vietnamese people. Your legitimate economic and cultural activities are also beneficial to Vietnam. Therefore, I suggest that you quietly continue your work as usual. The people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will help and protect you.

The proclamation concluded: After such a great change in the situation, restoring the normal life of the capital will be complex and difficult. But thanks to the government's determination and the unity and support of all the compatriots in Hanoi, we will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve our common goal: to make Hanoi a peaceful, happy, and prosperous capital.

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, issued an order on the 9th to the Vietnamese People's Army troops marching into Hanoi to recover the capital.

The order said that French Federation forces are withdrawing from Hanoi in accordance with the agreement signed by both sides. You are entrusted by President Ho Chi Minh and the government with the task of marching into the capital.

The order pointed out that the complete liberation of our beloved capital is a great victory for the heroic resistance of our country's military and civilians, and also a great victory for our people's struggle for national liberation.

The order said: You, symbolizing the heroic and powerful People's Army, are the first troops to march into Hanoi amid the long-awaited hopes of our compatriots in the capital and the joy of the people across the country. Your mission is very important and very glorious.

The order said, in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, I order you: First, unite closely with the public security forces and the residents of the capital, resolutely maintain order and security in the capital, and protect the people and foreigners. Second, strictly implement the eight policies and ten disciplines stipulated by the government for newly liberated cities, abide by the discipline of the People's Army, cherish, respect, and help the people. Third, maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times, strengthen combat spirit, maintain the simple and patient style of the People's Army, and be prepared to crush any provocative conspiracies of saboteurs.

The order finally called on the troops marching into Hanoi to resolutely complete their mission under the banner of peace, unity, independence, and democracy.

    越南人民军解放首都河内
    胡志明主席向河内居民发表文告
    武元甲将军向进军河内的部队发布命令
   【新华社北越九日电】越南人民军今日（九日）已开进了到处飘扬红旗和充满欢呼声的河内市区，曾被法军侵占了将近八年的越南民主共和国首都已告解放。
    越南人民军按照日内瓦会议协定和扶罗会议的具体协议，在九日上午六时开始进入河内市区。从同一时间起，法军开始分区逐段地撤离。双方的交接从河内市西面和南面的机关、住宅区逐渐向东北角商业区方面推进。乘着卡车的越南人民军先头部队在中午十二时以前，就已秩序井然地接管了原河内市政府、法国总督府、北越首宪府（保大政府北越主席办公处）等机关。金星红旗也在河内火车站、河内大戏院、越南大学（原“河内大学”）等高大的建筑物的上空迎风招展。
    越南人民军和越南民主共和国政府河内市军政委员会干部们到达那里，那里的住宅和商号就纷纷高悬起鲜艳的国旗，开门出来欢迎。当越南人民军某部到电力公司担任警戒时，职工们热情地前来欢迎，向战士们献花致敬。其余的职工在车间里忙碌工作，使机器照常运转。自来水公司也一刻不停地向全市供应用水。
    解放了的人们涌向街头，兴高采烈，向部队和政府工作人员欢呼：“越南和平、统一、独立、民主万岁！”“胡志明主席万岁！”
   【新华社北越九日电】十月八日，越南人民军和越南民主共和国政府的干部从法兰西联邦部队手中有秩序地接收了河内罗城堤堰以外的广大郊区，其中包括南郊的白梅机场和郊区的数十个市集和村庄。
    八日十一时半，越南人民军的三支部队从南面、西南面、西面的三条宽坦的公路向河内方向冒雨前进。战士们高举着巨大的金星红旗，一队接着一队。沿途绿色的村庄上空也悬挂着一面面金星红旗。农民和小市上的人们挤在公路两旁冒雨欢迎自己的部队，打着雨伞的老人因高呼口号而嗓音嘶哑，年青的母亲怀抱中的小孩向战士们挥着小手，所有的人都向每一队的战士报以热烈的欢呼和掌声，战士们在行进中微笑着回手作答。两个多月来，吴庭艳集团的军队在这些男女老少的面前对越南人民军作了恶意的诽谤，但是今天人们是这样的热情和无忧无虑地拥挤得只给战士们留下一条窄路通过，热情地欢迎他们来解放自己，并且兴奋地欢送他们向河内进军。
   【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社北越九日讯：越南民主共和国胡志明主席在越南民主共和国首都河内解放之际向河内的居民发表文告。文告说：在过去八年中，政府曾不得不离开首都以抗战救国。尽管有这种分离，但是政府始终是怀念着首都的同胞的。
    今天，由于我们人民的团结以及我们军队的英勇战斗，和平已经恢复了。现在，政府回到了首都和你们在一起。由于我们是同一家庭的成员，我们的欢欣实在是无法形容的。
    文告说：自从第二次世界大战以来，河内已经历了十多年的战争。这一段时期是相当长的，所受的损失是巨大的。首都还保持了现在的样子，完全是由于你们所进行的积极斗争。然而，我们的政府和人民今后应当共同努力恢复、巩固并发展我们首都的精神生活和物质生活。
    文告指出：我们政府和人民应共同努力维持治安。同时，我们必须共同发起一个“勤劳、节俭、公正和廉洁”的运动，发起一个保持良好态度和习惯的运动。
    我们必须执行政府的经济政策，给予国营和私营企业以足够的关怀，并使劳资两利。工人们应热情地参加生产。工商界人士应积极地经营企业。我们必须保持和恢复我们首都内的一切生产、贸易、经济和财政活动。
    政府和学生家长们应同心协力，以便使我们的儿童能继续进行学习。文化和教育工作者应积极地为人民服务。我们必须保持和恢复一切文化活动。
    从政治观点来看，我们必须紧密地团结起来，实现民主自由。每一个人都应该尽其全力来恢复首都，建立起一个和平、统一、独立和民主的越南。
    总之，我们的人民、军队和干部必须正确地执行政策，遵守河内人民军政委员会所颁布的纪律。
    文告并对外侨说：你们一直和越南人民生活在一起。你们正当的经济和文化活动对越南也是有利的。因此，我建议你们安静地照常进行你们的工作。越南民主共和国人民和政府将会帮助和保护你们。
    文告最后说：在局势发生巨大变化之后，恢复首都的正常生活将是复杂而困难的。但是由于政府的决心，由于河内全体同胞的一心一德和支持，我们一定将克服一切困难，达到我们的共同目的：使河内成为一个和平、愉快和繁荣的首都。
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军九日向进军河内收复首都的越南人民军部队发布命令。
    命令说，法兰西联邦部队按照双方签订的协议撤出河内。你们受胡志明主席和政府的委托，负着进军首都的任务。
    命令指出，我们可爱的首都的完全解放，是我国军民英勇抗战的伟大胜利，也是我国人民争取民族解放的斗争的伟大胜利。
    命令说：象征着英勇和强大的人民军的你们，是在首都内的同胞长期盼望和全国同胞欢欣鼓舞的情况下进军河内的第一批部队。你们的任务是非常重大也是非常光荣的。
    命令说，我以越南人民军总司令的名义命令你们：一、和公安部队等以及首都的居民密切团结，坚决维持首都的秩序和治安，保护人民和外侨。二、严格执行政府规定的对待新解放城市的八项政策和十大纪律，遵守人民军的纪律，爱护、尊重和帮助人民。三、时刻保持高度的警惕，加强战斗精神，保持人民军的简朴和耐心的作风，准备粉碎破坏分子的任何挑衅阴谋。
    命令最后号召进军河内的部队在和平、统一、独立和民主的旗帜下，坚决完成任务。
