Dear Comrades and Friends:

    On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Romanian government delegation, entrusted by the government of the People's Republic of Romania and the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, is honored to extend warm, fraternal greetings to the great Chinese people, the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China and the most beloved son of the Chinese people.

    While celebrating this great event, we, on behalf of the Romanian people, express our infinite joy, which also inspires the Romanian people. This is because this great event has opened up a path to a new and happy life for the Chinese people and has written a page of world significance in human history.

    Due to the victory of the people's revolution, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, have forever shaken off the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, which had plunged beautiful, rich, and vast China into a state of backwardness and darkness. China has transformed from a semi-colonial appendage into a powerful, independent, and autonomous nation.

    The victory of the Chinese people's revolution has given new and powerful encouragement to the enslaved people of Asia and other continents in their national liberation struggles against imperialism. Today, imperialist aggressors can no longer unscrupulously enslave the Asian people.

    Thanks to the consolidated worker-peasant alliance and the great unity of the people throughout the country within the People's Democratic United Front, the hardworking and intelligent Chinese people, with unparalleled patriotic enthusiasm, have restored the national economy that was destroyed by imperialist plunder and prolonged wars. With a widespread surge of creative labor enthusiasm, the first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy is proceeding victoriously.

    At the National People's Congress, the first democratic constitution in Chinese history was adopted. This constitution affirms the achievements of the people's democratic state in political and economic construction and expresses the unwavering will of the Chinese people to transform their motherland into a powerful socialist country.

    Inspired by this great aspiration and closely united, the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have become a force that no one can stop from advancing along its historical path.

    The firm struggle of the People's China against imperialist aggression and conspiracies, the struggle to defend the independence of democratic Korea, the contribution to the restoration of peace in Indochina, and the consistent advocacy of easing international tensions and establishing normal relations between countries with different social systems, all demonstrate that the People's Republic of China is playing the role of a world power and making important contributions to the cause of security and peace for the people of the East and the people of the world.

    The great friendship and consolidated alliance between the Soviet Union and the People's China, as well as the fraternal unity among the countries of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp, are a strong fortress and the most precious victory for peace-loving people and progressive humanity.

    The Romanian people, together with all progressive humanity, regard the great victories of the fraternal Chinese people as their own and are sincerely rejoiced by these victories.

    The Romanian people have also suffered from the cruel rule of imperialist aggressors. The Soviet Union's historic victory over fascism and the liberation of Romania have created conditions for the Romanian people, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, to take control of their own destiny, finally shatter imperialist enslavement, establish a people's democratic regime, and victoriously carry out socialist construction. During the period of the people's democratic regime, thanks to the creativity and enthusiasm of the working people in urban and rural areas, the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, and cooperation with other people's democratic countries, Romania has made great progress in the socialist construction of the country. Industrial production in 1953 was two and a half times that of 1938, the socialist component in agriculture has emerged and is constantly growing, and art, science, and literature are also developing vigorously.

    The Romanian Workers' Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Romania are mobilizing all creative forces to eliminate the backwardness of agriculture and develop the production of consumer goods, thereby continuously improving the material welfare of the people.

    The Romanian people cherish fraternal friendship and respect for the Chinese people. The Romanian people warmly congratulate the Chinese people on their complete victory in achieving the great goal of building socialism and wish the Chinese people happiness and prosperity. We are deeply convinced that our two countries, based on the constantly consolidating principles of fraternal friendship and cooperation among the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, will continuously deepen and develop the multifaceted relations that connect our two countries and benefit our common cause.

    Long live the indestructible friendship between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people!

    Long live the great Chinese people, the creators of New China!

    Long live the free and independent People's Republic of China! Long live the State Council of the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the heroic Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee, the guide and leader of the Chinese people on their advance along the glorious road of socialism!

    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people!

    Long live the struggle of the people of all countries for the cause of human progress and for the victory of peace throughout the world!

    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团团长
    阿波斯托尔的讲话亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    值此中华人民共和国成立五周年之际，罗马尼亚政府代表团受罗马尼亚人民共和国政府和罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会的委托，荣幸地向伟大的中国人民，中华人民共和国国务院，中国共产党中央委员会，和中华人民共和国主席、中国人民最热爱的儿子——毛泽东同志，致热烈的、兄弟般的敬礼。
    在庆祝这个伟大的事件的时候，我们代表罗马尼亚人民表达自己无限的欢欣，同时这种欢欣也鼓舞着罗马尼亚人民。因为这个伟大的事件为中国人民开辟了走向幸福的新生活的道路，并在人类历史上写下了具有世界意义的一页。
    由于人民革命的胜利，中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，永远摆脱了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的羁绊，由于帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，曾经使美丽、富饶和幅员广阔的中国陷于落后与黑暗的状态。中国已从一个半殖民地的附属国家变成为一个强大的、独立自主的国家。
    中国人民革命的胜利给予在反对帝国主义的民族解放斗争中的亚洲及其他各洲被奴役人民以新的、有力的鼓舞。今天帝国主义侵略者已再不能肆无忌惮地奴役亚洲人民了。
    由于巩固的工农联盟和全国人民在人民民主阵线中的大团结，勤劳智慧的中国人民，以无比的爱国热情，恢复了由于帝国主义掠夺和长期战争所破坏的国民经济。在创造性的劳动热情普遍高涨的情况下，发展国民经济的第一个五年计划正在胜利地进行着。
    在全国人民代表大会上，通过了中国历史上的第一部民主的宪法。这个宪法肯定了人民民主国家在政治和经济建设中的成就，并表达了中国人民把自己的祖国变为一个强大的社会主义国家的不可动摇的意志。
    被这个伟大的愿望所鼓舞着的、并紧密团结在一起的中国人民，在中国共产党的英明领导下，已成为一支任何人都无法阻止其历史进程的力量。
    人民中国反对帝国主义侵略和阴谋的坚决斗争，保卫民主朝鲜独立的斗争，对恢复印度支那和平所作的贡献，以及一贯主张缓和国际紧张局势和不同社会制度的国家间可以建立正常关系的政策，这些都表明了中华人民共和国正起着一个世界大国的作用，并对东方人民和全世界人民的安全与和平事业作出了重要的贡献。
    苏联和人民中国间伟大的友谊和巩固的联盟以及和平民主社会主义阵营各国间的兄弟般的团结，是一个坚强的堡垒，是爱好和平的人民和进步人类的最宝贵的胜利果实。
    罗马尼亚人民与全体进步人类一起把兄弟中国人民的伟大胜利当作自己的胜利，并因这些胜利而由衷地感到欢欣鼓舞。
    罗马尼亚人民也曾遭受到帝国主义侵略者的残酷统治。苏联战胜法西斯的历史性的胜利和罗马尼亚的解放，为在罗马尼亚工人党领导下的罗马尼亚人民掌握自己命运、最后粉碎帝国主义奴役、建立人民民主政权并胜利地进行社会主义建设，创造了条件。在人民民主政权时期，由于城乡劳动人民的创造性和积极性，由于苏联的兄弟般的帮助以及和各人民民主国家的合作，罗马尼亚在国家的社会主义建设中，已有了很大的进展。一九五三年的工业生产已为一九三八年的二倍半，农业中的社会主义成分业已出现并在不断地增长着，艺术、科学和文学也在欣欣向荣地发展着。
    罗马尼亚工人党和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府正在动员一切创造性的力量以消灭农业的落后状态和发展消费品的生产，从而日益提高人民的物质福利。
    罗马尼亚人民对中国人民怀着兄弟般的友爱和敬意。罗马尼亚人民热烈地祝贺中国人民在实现建设社会主义的伟大目标上获得完全的胜利，祝中国人民幸福和繁荣。我们深信我们两国根据不断巩固的以伟大苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营中各国间兄弟般的友好与合作的原则，将不断地使联系着我们两国并有利于我们共同事业的多方面的关系日益密切，日益发展。
    罗马尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民间的不可摧毁的友谊发展万岁！
    新中国的创造者——伟大的中国人民万岁！
    自由、独立的中华人民共和国万岁！中华人民共和国国务院万岁！
    中国人民在社会主义光辉道路上前进的引导者和领导者——英雄的中国共产党及其中央委员会万岁！
    中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    各国人民争取人类进步和争取和平事业在全世界胜利的斗争万岁！
