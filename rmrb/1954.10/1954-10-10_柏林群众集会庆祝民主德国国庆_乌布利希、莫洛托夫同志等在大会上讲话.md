Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 8th: A mass rally was held on Marx-Engels Square in Berlin on October 7th to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

Amidst enthusiastic cheers from the entire audience, President Wilhelm Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl, Vice-Chairman of the People's Chamber Hermann Matern, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht, Chairman of the Senate Reinhold Lobedanz, Deputy Prime Ministers Otto Nuschke, Heinrich Rau, and Hans Loch, and Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany Erich Correns, ascended the rostrum.

When the members of the Soviet government delegation, headed by First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, and member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, V.M. Molotov, and the members of the government delegations of other countries participating in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic appeared on the rostrum, the entire audience greeted them with stormy applause. The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Walter Ulbricht, first addressed the assembly.

In his speech, Ulbricht first pointed out that the presence of delegations from the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist democratic camp, as well as many delegations from capitalist countries, to participate in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, proves the firm friendly ties between Germany's forces of peace and the peace-loving people of all countries.

Ulbricht emphasized that the German Democratic Republic is a solid base for the democratic and peace-loving forces of the German people in their struggle to restore the unity of their motherland. He then said: The wealthy arms dealers and Hitlerite generals of West Germany are doing everything possible to push Germany for the third time onto the path of remilitarization and the disaster of war. The London Conference passed a resolution on West Germany's accession to the Western military pact, which is a blow to the vital interests of the German people and the European people. The aim pursued by the London negotiations is the long-term division of Germany. The German people will never agree to the results of the one-sided negotiations in London.

Ulbricht repeated what V.M. Molotov said at the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin: Solving the problem of restoring German unity is the main and most urgent task. He stressed that the Soviet government's grant of sovereignty to the German Democratic Republic has helped to promote the restoration of German unity.

Ulbricht continued that, in this way, the representatives of the People's Chamber and the government of the German Democratic Republic have been given full power to negotiate with the representatives of West Germany.

In contrast, Adenauer suggested in London that the issue of a unified Germany be regarded as within the scope of the Western powers. Adenauer has no right to make such statements. Solving the problem of restoring German unity and sending its own plenipotentiary representatives so that representatives from both parts of Germany can conduct negotiations is a matter for the people of West Germany and their representatives themselves, and cannot be determined by the self-interest of the U.S. government. Whoever does not want negotiations is an enemy of restoring German unity.

We solemnly pledge to do everything possible to bring the two parts of Germany closer together by expanding economic and cultural relations and through cooperation among social organizations.

Ulbricht called on the working people of Germany to unite in the struggle for an all-German agreement in order to strive for the restoration of Germany's unity and independence and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The audience welcomed his call with stormy applause.

Ulbricht went on to say that the German people welcome the Soviet government's proposal that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union immediately reach an agreement on the withdrawal of occupying forces from the territories of East and West Germany. This agreement would greatly promote the restoration of German unity and further ease international tensions. Only the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany can fundamentally solve the German problem. The Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic has suggested to the representatives of the Federal Republic of Bonn that they now begin to exchange views on their respective positions on the conclusion of this treaty, so that the will of the people can be expressed on a jointly discussed basis during future four-power negotiations.

Ulbricht continued, the Soviet government's proposal at the UN General Assembly on disarmament and supervision of disarmament is fully in line with the vital interests of the German people. Ulbricht emphasized that as long as the working class of all Germany is united, as long as the forces of peace and democracy fight under the banner of the National Front of Democratic Germany, no force can prevent the restoration of German unity.

Only when all European countries sign a treaty guaranteeing the collective security of all European countries can the peaceful life of the German people and the European people be guaranteed.

Ulbricht finally exclaimed: Long live the German Democratic Republic – the bulwark for restoring German unity on a democratic basis! Long live the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the German people and the great Soviet people! Long live world peace!

The assembly enthusiastically adopted a congratulatory telegram proposed by Professor Correns, addressed to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows: To the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the mass rally in the German capital of Berlin, representing all German patriots, sends fraternal fighting greetings to the Soviet people, and thanks them for their continued support in all aspects of the German people's just struggle for national unity and a happy and peaceful life.

We realize that the friendship between our two peoples is of extreme importance for guaranteeing peace in Europe and is in line with Germany's vital interests, therefore, we solemnly declare: Soviet-German friendship is a cause closely related to our own, and we will defend this sacred cause.

The German Democratic Republic is a vivid example for all the people of our country. Here, the working class and the working peasants have formed an alliance, and have united all democratic and patriotic forces in a united national front, leading them in the struggle against the danger of the revival of German militarism, and striving to reunify Germany, so that Germany can embark on the road of democratic and peaceful development.

The working people of West Germany and all peace-loving and patriotic Germans, based on the economic, cultural and political development of the German Democratic Republic, are convinced that the peaceful policy pursued by the government of the German Democratic Republic, which represents the interests of the German nation, is correct. The German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, our most respected President, a long-tested fighter standing at the forefront of the struggle for peace, democracy, and mutual understanding among the peoples of all countries, is steadfastly moving towards a happy future. We know that the imperialist forces in West Germany, under the guidance of the American aggressive bloc, are attempting to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the German question. However, we, the democrats and patriots of Germany, will tirelessly strive for mutual understanding among the German people, in order to restore German unity through free all-German elections. We will likewise do our utmost to contribute to the peaceful cooperation of the peoples of all countries.

Long live Soviet-German friendship!

Long live world peace!

Long live a united, democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany!

Next, V.M. Molotov, head of the Soviet government delegation, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, spoke. The full text is as follows:

Dear Comrades and Friends!

On behalf of the Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, I extend to you my heartfelt congratulations on the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. (Applause)

The day of the founding of the German Democratic Republic has become a holiday for the working people. The fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, which we are celebrating today, is especially such a day.

Today, it may be recalled that the Federal Republic of Germany was also founded five years ago. It was founded about a month earlier than the German Democratic Republic. Today, as everyone here celebrates the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, many people will ask: Did West Germany also celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Federal Republic? If West Germany also held a celebration, everyone should know about it.

Here is a question: Why has the anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic become a holiday for the working people, while the day of the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany has passed without a sound or smell, without the participation of the masses of the people? Many reasons can be given to explain why the situation in East and West Germany is so different. But it is enough to talk about the main point.

The problem is that workers and peasants, manual and intellectual laborers, all believe that the German Democratic Republic is a country built by their own hands, its achievements are earned by their selfless labor, and they are proud of its achievements. The master of the German Democratic Republic is the people, therefore, the masses of the people celebrate its significant fifth anniversary with great joy. (Applause)

Therefore, the people celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic with a proud heart, turning this holiday into a national celebration, which inspires the working people to create new labor achievements, and unites all democratic and patriotic forces more closely, to strive for new and greater achievements in economic and cultural construction.

Precisely because the master of the Federal Republic of Germany is not the people, but the big capitalists, landlords, and their puppets, the people will not celebrate the founding of this republic. The day when the people are in charge in West Germany will surely come, and then the people will speak, and will be happy to celebrate their own significant day. (Prolonged applause)

As for our time, the more clearly the people of West Germany understand the significance of celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the more working people of West Germany participate in this celebration, the better it will be for the entire German people. (Applause)

The working people of the German Democratic Republic have many important and urgent tasks: in industry and agriculture, in transportation and trade, in the development of national education and culture, in improving the lives of urban and rural residents, and in improving the work of all organizations, there are many important and urgent tasks.

Despite the importance of these tasks, the conscious workers and peasants of the German Democratic Republic, and it can be said all German democrats and patriots, must remember that Germany is still divided into two parts; the reunification of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy is the most urgent and important task of the German people.

Struggling to restore the unity of Germany should be the focus of attention of the working people of the German Democratic Republic. The struggle to restore the unity of Germany should unite the democrats and patriots of East and West Germany, and they should remember that the main obstacle on this road at present is the conspiracies of the aggressive blocs of Europe and America, which rely on the West German militarists and revanchists who want to achieve the goal of reviving German militarism at any cost.

There are many obstacles on the road to restoring German unity. However, all these obstacles must be overcome, as long as all German democrats and patriots truly take on the cause of making German unity a democratic and peaceful Germany, this cause will surely be victorious. (Applause)

The Soviet Union firmly opposes the revival of German militarism, and it also firmly and consistently advocates that the unity of Germany must be restored immediately. (Applause)

The relationship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic is built on trust in democratic forces and trust in the National Front of Democratic Germany, which unites the entire democratic force. The working people of the Republic can rely on the Soviet Union in all their internal and foreign affairs, and they need the support of the Soviet Union in these areas. (Stormy applause)

In the struggle of the democratic and peaceful forces of the German people to restore the unity of Germany, they will receive all-round support from the Soviet Union. (Applause)

Long live the German Democratic Republic and the government of the German Democratic Republic! (Stormy applause)

Long live the leading force of the National Front of Democratic Germany – the Socialist Unity Party of Germany! (Stormy applause)

Long live a united, independent, peaceful, and democratic Germany! (Stormy applause)

May the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet people and the German people continue to grow and consolidate! (Stormy, prolonged applause. Turning into cheers: "Friendship!", "Friendship!")

Next, Jonas, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, spoke. He read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the French Communist Party.

After this, a representative of many West German labor people's delegations who visited the German Democratic Republic read a short congratulatory speech, he stressed that the achievements of the peaceful construction of the German Democratic Republic - the first peaceful, democratic worker-peasant state in German history - have all-German significance.

The last to speak at the conference was Otto Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic.

Nuschke emphasized that Molotov's proposal on the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces stationed in Germany and the Soviet delegation's proposal at the United Nations on disarmament and prohibition of atomic weapons are of great significance for easing international tensions and solving the German question.

Nuschke went on to point out that the German Democratic Republic is constantly striving for mutual understanding among the Germans to promote the reunification of Germany. He said that the Bonn government had not responded to the repeated proposals put forward by the People's Chamber and the government of the German Democratic Republic on this issue, and turned a deaf ear to these proposals. Adenauer, the head of this militaristic country, the Federal Republic, has openly embarked on the road of arming Germany. He dared to shamelessly say that he was speaking on behalf of the German people. Adenauer does not have this right.

The mass rally of the working people of Berlin, attended by hundreds of thousands of people, is a vivid example of the fact that the working people are united around their own people's government, united around the party of the working class, and determined to continue along the path of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    柏林群众集会庆祝民主德国国庆
    乌布利希、莫洛托夫同志等在大会上讲话
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林八日电：为庆祝德意志民主共和国成立五周年，十月七日，在柏林的马克思—恩格斯广场举行了群众大会。
    在全场热烈的欢呼声下，德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克，总理奥托·格罗提渥，人民议院副主席赫尔曼·马特恩，德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、副总理瓦尔特·乌布利希，参议院主席兰霍德·罗贝丹兹，副总理奥托·努舍克、亨利希·劳和汉斯·洛赫以及民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席埃里希·柯伦斯等走上了主席台。
    当以苏联部长会议第一副主席、苏联外交部长、苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员维·米·莫洛托夫为首的苏联政府代表团团员以及参加德意志民主共和国成立五周年国庆典礼的其他国家的政府代表团的人员出现在主席台上时，全场报以暴风雨般的掌声。德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、德意志民主共和国副总理瓦尔特·乌布利希在大会上首先致词。
    乌布利希在他的讲话中首先指出：苏联和社会主义民主阵营的国家以及资本主义国家的许多代表团前来参加德意志民主共和国成立五周年国庆典礼，这证明了德国的和平力量与爱好和平的各国人民有着牢固的友谊联系。
    乌布利希着重指出，德意志民主共和国是德国人民的民主和爱好和平的力量为争取恢复祖国统一而斗争的巩固基地。他接着说道：西德的豪富的军火商们和希特勒将领们尽一切力量想第三次把德国推上重新军国主义化和战争灾难的道路。伦敦会议通过了关于使西德加入西方军事公约的决议，它是对德国人民和欧洲人民切身利益的打击。伦敦谈判所追求的目的是长期分裂德国。德国人民永远不同意伦敦的片面谈判的结果。
    乌布利希重复了维·米·莫洛托夫在柏林德意志民主共和国建国五周年庆祝大会上所说的话：解决恢复德国统一的问题是主要的和最迫切的任务。他强调指出，苏联政府方面已给予了德意志民主共和国以主权，因而有助于促进恢复德国的统一。
    乌布利希继续说道，这样，德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府的代表就获得了全权来和西德代表进行谈判。
    与此相反，阿登纳在伦敦建议把统一德国问题看作西方国家权限范围之内的问题。阿登纳没有任何权利发表这一类的声明。解决恢复德国统一的问题和选派自己的全权代表，以便德国两部分的代表能够进行谈判，这是西德人民和他们的代表自己的事，不是美国政府的一己利益所能决定的。谁不要谈判，谁就是恢复德国统一的敌人。
    我们庄严地保证：要尽一切力量通过扩大经济关系和文化关系的办法，通过社会团体进行合作的办法，使德国两部分接近起来。
    乌布利希号召德国劳动人民在争取全德协议的斗争中团结一致，以便争取恢复德国的统一和独立以及缔结对德和约，到会者以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎他的这一号召。
    乌布利希接着说，德国人民欢迎苏联政府提出的建议：美国、英国、法国和苏联立即达成关于从东德和西德领土上撤退占领军的协议。这一协议会大大地促进德国统一的恢复，同时并会使国际紧张局势进一步缓和。只有缔结对德和约，才能从根本上解决德国问题。德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团向波恩联邦共和国代表建议，现在开始就他们对缔结这一和约的立场彼此交换意见，以便在将来举行四国谈判时，可以在共同商讨过的基础上表达人民的意志。
    乌布利希继续说，苏联政府在联合国大会上所提出的关于裁军和裁军的监督的建议是完全符合德国人民的切身利益的。乌布利希着重指出，只要全德国的工人阶级团结一致，只要和平民主力量在民主德国全国阵线的旗帜下进行斗争，那么，任何力量都不能阻挠恢复德国的统一。
    只有所有的欧洲国家签订一个保证欧洲各国集体安全的条约，德国人民和欧洲各国人民的和平生活才能得到保证。
    乌布利希最后高呼：德意志民主共和国——争取在民主的基础上恢复德国统一的堡垒万岁，德国人民和伟大的苏联人民之间牢不可破的永恒友谊万岁，世界和平万岁。
    大会十分兴奋地通过了柯伦斯教授提出的、给苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会的致敬电。
    致敬电全文如下：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议苏联共产党中央委员会
    在德意志民主共和国成立五周年这一天，德国首都柏林的群众大会代表德国全体爱国者，向苏联人民致兄弟的战斗的敬礼，并感谢他们对德国人民争取全国统一与和平幸福的生活的正义斗争不断给予各方面的支持。
    我们意识到，我们两国人民的友谊对保障欧洲和平具有极端重要的意义，并且是符合德国的切身利益的，因此，我们郑重表示：德苏友谊是与我们切身相关的事业，我们将保卫这一神圣的事业。
    德意志民主共和国是我国全体人民的一个鲜明的榜样，在这里，工人阶级和劳动农民结成了联盟，并把全国一切民主和爱国力量团结成为统一的民族阵线，领导他们进行斗争，反对德国军国主义复活的危险，争取重新统一德国，使德国走上民主地和平发展的道路。
    西德的劳动人民和一切爱好和平的和爱国的德国人根据德意志民主共和国的经济、文化和政治的发展情况，确信德意志民主共和国政府所执行的、代表德国民族利益的和平政策是正确的，德意志民主共和国在久经考验的，站在为和平、民主、与各国人民之间的互相谅解而斗争的最前列的战士，我们最敬重的总统威廉·皮克同志的领导下，坚定不移地走向幸福的将来。我们知道，西德的帝国主义力量，在美国侵略集团的指导下，企图阻挠和平解决德国问题。但是，我们，德国的民主人士和爱国者们，将不倦地争取德国人民之间的互相谅解，以便通过全德自由选举来恢复德国的统一。我们同样地将竭尽全力为各国人民的和平合作而作出贡献。
    德苏友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    统一、民主、和平、独立的德国万岁！
    接着，苏联政府代表团团长、苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫讲话。全文如下：
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我代表苏联人民和苏联共产党向你们表示对德意志民主共和国成立五周年的衷心的祝贺。（掌声）
    德意志民主共和国成立的日子已成为劳动人民的节日。我们今天所庆祝的德意志民主共和国成立五周年纪念日，就尤其是这样的日子。
    今天可以回想一下，德意志联邦共和国也是五年前成立的。它大约比德意志民主共和国早成立一个月。今天，当大家在这儿庆祝德意志民主共和国成立五周年的时候，许多人会问：在西德是否也庆祝了联邦共和国成立五周年呢？如果西德也举行了庆祝的话，那是大家应当会知道的。
    这里就有一个问题：为什么德意志民主共和国成立纪念日成为劳动人民的节日，而德意志联邦共和国成立的日子却无声无臭地过去了，没有人民群众参加庆祝呢？可以举出许多理由来说明为什么东德和西德的情况如此不同。但是，谈一点主要的就够了。
    问题在于工人和农民，体力劳动者和智力劳动者都认为，德意志民主共和国是他们自己亲手建立的国家，它的成就是他们以忘我的劳动换来的，他们为它的成就而感到自豪。德意志民主共和国的主人是人民，因此，人民群众兴高采烈地庆祝它的成立五周年这一意义重大的日子。（掌声）
    因此人民以骄傲的心情庆祝德意志民主共和国成立五周年，把这一节日变成举国欢庆的节日，它鼓舞劳动人民建立新的劳动功绩，它把一切民主和爱国力量团结得更加紧密，来争取经济和文化方面的建设的新的更大的成就。
    正因为德意志联邦共和国的主人不是人民，而是大资本家、地主以及他们的傀儡，人民就不会庆祝这一共和国的成立。在西德，人民当家作主的日子一定会到来，而那时人民就会说话了，就会乐意庆祝自己的意义重大的日子了。（经久不息的掌声）
    至于在我们这个时代，西德的人民愈清楚地知道庆祝德意志民主共和国成立周年纪念的意义，愈多的西德劳动人民参加这一庆祝，那对全体德国人民的好处就愈大。（掌声）
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民有许多重要而迫切的任务：在工业和农业方面，在运输和贸易方面，在发展国民教育和文化方面，在改善城市和乡村居民生活方面，以及在改进一切组织的工作方面，都有许多重要而迫切的任务。
    尽管这些任务是重要的，德意志民主共和国的觉悟的工人和农民，也可以说所有的德国民主分子和爱国分子都要记住：德国仍旧还分裂为两部分；在和平和民主的基础上统一德国是德国人民的最迫切和最重要的任务。
    为恢复德国的统一而奋斗，这应该是德意志民主共和国劳动人民注意的中心。为恢复德国的统一而进行的斗争应该使东德和西德的民主分子和爱国分子团结起来，他们应该记住：目前在这条道路上的主要障碍是欧洲和美洲的侵略集团的阴谋诡计，他们依赖的是不惜任何代价要达到复活德国军国主义这一目的的西德军国主义者和复仇主义者。
    在恢复德国统一的道路上，存在的障碍是不少的。但是，所有这些障碍都一定会被克服，只要全体德国民主分子和爱国分子真正地担当起使德国统一成为一个民主、和平的德国的事业，这个事业一定会胜利。（掌声）
    苏联坚定不移地反对德国军国主义的复活，它同样坚决和一贯到底地主张，必须立即恢复德国的统一。（掌声）
    苏联和德意志民主共和国的关系是建立在信任民主力量和信任团结了整个民主力量的民主德国全国阵线的基础上的。共和国的劳动人民可以在自己的一切内政和外交事务方面信赖苏联，他们在这些方面需要苏联的支持。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在德国人民的民主、和平力量争取恢复德国的统一的斗争中，他们将得到苏联各方面的支持。（掌声）
    德意志民主共和国和德意志民主共和国政府万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    民主德国全国阵线的领导力量——德国统一社会党万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    统一、独立、和平、民主的德国万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    祝苏联人民和德国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊不断成长和巩固！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。转入欢呼：“友好！”，“友好！”）
    接着，法国共产党中央委员会委员约纳讲话。他宣读了法国共产党中央委员会的贺电。
    此后，访问德意志民主共和国的许多西德劳动人民代表团的一位代表宣读了简短的贺词，他着重指出，德意志民主共和国——德国历史上第一个和平、民主的工农国家——的和平建设的成就具有全德国的意义。
    在大会上最后讲话的是德意志民主共和国副总理奥托·努舍克。
    努舍克着重指出，莫洛托夫提出的、关于立即撤退驻德占领军的建议和苏联代表团在联合国提出的，关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的建议对于缓和国际紧张局势和解决德国问题具有重大的意义。
    努舍克接着指出，德意志民主共和国在不断努力求得德国人之间的互相谅解，以促进德国的重新统一。他说，但是波恩政府没有答复人民议院和德意志民主共和国政府屡次就这一问题提出的建议，对这些建议充耳不闻。联邦共和国这个军国主义国家的首脑阿登纳已公开地走上了武装德国的道路。他竟敢无耻地说，他是在代表德国人民讲话。阿登纳是没有这个权利的。
    有数十万人参加的柏林劳动人民群众大会是一个鲜明的例证，说明劳动人民团结在他们自己的人民政府的周围，团结在工人阶级政党的周围，说明他们决心继续沿着和平、民主、社会主义的道路前进。
