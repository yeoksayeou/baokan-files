    Solidarity Between China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries
    Wu Yuzhang
    The People's Republic of China has been established for five years. As our people are warmly celebrating National Day, progressive people all over the world are congratulating and cheering our country. What is particularly exciting is that the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev and the government delegations of various people's democratic countries have come to our capital, Beijing, with the deep friendship of the people of all fraternal countries to participate in the National Day celebrations. This unprecedented grand event is a remarkable symbol of the great unity between our country and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    The establishment of the People's Republic of China is the result of the victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution with the support of the world's revolutionary forces led by the Soviet Union; thereby greatly strengthening the strength of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp. The establishment of the People's Republic of China marks the beginning of a new period in the development of friendship between the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. Chairman Mao taught us on the eve of the founding of the country in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that we must resolutely "lean to the side of socialism"; in his opening speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he instructed that "internationally, we must unite with all countries and peoples who love peace and freedom, first of all with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries." Over the past five years, our people have steadfastly implemented Chairman Mao's instructions; the unity between our country and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed, becoming an invincible force.
    The day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government was the first to recognize the People's Republic of China and establish diplomatic relations with our country. At the time, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Outer Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and other countries all swiftly established diplomatic relations with our country.
    Shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong personally led the Chinese government delegation to Moscow and, together with the responsible comrades of the Soviet government headed by Comrade Stalin, discussed important political and economic issues related to the two countries, and signed the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" of great significance in February 1950, solidifying the unity of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union and forming an unbreakable alliance. The light of this treaty will forever shine in history. The two countries also signed the "Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou and Dalian" and the "Agreement on Loans to the People's Republic of China" at the same time, followed by other agreements, which have had a very important effect on the development of our national cause. In the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance, the Soviet Union has returned to our country free of charge the Chinese Changchun Railway, which was originally jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, and the enterprises and other properties in Northeast China that the Soviet Union obtained from Japan. The Soviet Union helped our country overcome the difficulties in compiling the first five-year plan for national construction. The Soviet Union provided systematic economic and technical assistance for the construction and reconstruction of 141 large-scale enterprises in our country. These enterprises are the backbone of our country's industrial construction projects during the first five-year plan. After these enterprises are all completed and put into operation, our country's socialist industrialization will gain a solid foundation. At the same time, the Soviet Union has also provided tremendous assistance in our country's restoration and development of transportation, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, the establishment of strong state-owned and cooperative commerce, the construction of people's cultural and educational undertakings, and the training of cadres. This great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance has never been seen in human history.
    In order to build the country, Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party have repeatedly called on the people of the whole country to earnestly learn from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's experience in building socialism is a complete scientific summary of more than 30 years of practice. With the guidance of these experiences, our people's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation can be carried out smoothly. Soviet socialist culture represents the vanguard of world cultural development, and it is a model for our construction of a new culture. Learning from the Soviet Union is the direction of work for all departments of our country's national construction. Over the past five years, our people have accepted and disseminated Soviet experience through various methods, and the upsurge of learning is increasing day by day. The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" campaign in 1952 and the "Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction," which will soon open in Beijing, are of great significance in promoting our people's learning from the Soviet Union. In order to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, the Chinese people have organized the widespread mass organization "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association" and carried out much work.
    Similarly, our country's fraternal friendship and political, economic, and cultural cooperation with the people's democratic countries are also being consolidated and developed day by day. Our country and the people's democratic countries have successively signed trade agreements, cultural cooperation agreements, and various other agreements. Our country's trade volume with the people's democratic countries has been increasing year by year. In 1953, our country's total trade value with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries was four times that of 1950. In 1953, our country's total trade value with the people's democratic countries increased by 25 percent compared with 1952. Last year, the industrial and agricultural machinery such as machine tools and power machines imported by our country from various people's democratic countries accounted for more than 51 percent of the total import value, an increase of nearly three times compared with 1952. This not only reflects the enthusiastic support of the fraternal countries for our country's economic construction, but also powerfully illustrates the brilliant achievements of the fraternal countries in industrial construction with the assistance of the Soviet Union. Our country has also exported important mineral products and agricultural and sideline products to the fraternal countries, trying its best to meet the needs of various countries in developing production and improving people's lives, and giving full play to the role of exchanging what one has for what one needs. Our country's cultural exchanges with various countries are also expanding day by day. Mao Zedong's works are being translated into various languages and widely disseminated among the people of various countries, becoming extremely valuable theoretical works. The scientific and educational institutions of various countries maintain close contact with our country's relevant institutions. Through holding various exhibitions, organizing art troupe performances, exchanging students, mutually translating books, introducing films and other extensive activities, the common prosperity of the cultures of various countries has been promoted, and these activities have become an indispensable factor in the cultural life of the people of various countries.
    Over the past five years, hundreds of delegations from our country and the fraternal countries have visited each other, conveying the friendship and love between the people. The patriotic spirit, unparalleled labor enthusiasm, and strong fighting will demonstrated by the people of various countries in the cause of socialist construction and the struggle for national reunification have given our people unlimited encouragement. It is particularly worth mentioning that the Mongolian People's Republic government delegation headed by Premier Tsedenbal visited our country in 1952, the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by Premier Kim Il-sung visited our country in 1953, Premier Zhou Enlai's talks with President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Sino-Vietnamese border during the Geneva Conference this year, Vice Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam visited our country after the Geneva Conference, and the Chinese government delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai successively visited the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Mongolia after visiting the Soviet Union, greatly enhancing the unity between us and the fraternal countries. In November 1953, China and North Korea concluded an agreement on economic and cultural cooperation, and on July 25, 1954, the premiers of China and the German Democratic Republic issued a joint communiqu√©, demonstrating the mutual concern and support of the Chinese, North Korean, and German people in the cause of peace.
    Facts have proved that the mutual concern and close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have played a tremendous role in ensuring common economic and cultural prosperity. The rapid completion of our country's economic recovery work over the past five years and the vigorous development of planned economic construction work are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Our people sincerely thank you for this assistance. This cooperation is the comradely mutual support within a peaceful and democratic family of countries whose people have already grasped power, and its foundation, as Comrade Stalin once pointed out, is "the sincere desire for mutual assistance and the pursuit of common economic prosperity." Therefore, our cooperation is close and no one can destroy it, and it will develop immeasurably with the common prosperity of the countries.
    At the same time, over the past five years, our country, in coordination with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, has waged a resolute struggle to defend world peace, oppose aggressive wars, and strive to ease international tensions. In this struggle, the Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship is the greatest pillar. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is permeated with the spirit of fighting for peace and universal security, and its main goal is to jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or other countries that collude with Japan in any form of aggressive acts. This has seriously hit the US imperialist's sinister conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a war base for launching aggression against the Soviet Union and China. Over the past five years, China and the Soviet Union have contributed fully to participating in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security with a spirit of faithful cooperation, and have consulted each other on major international issues related to the two countries. The Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship stands like a fortress, powerfully guaranteeing peace in the Far East and the world. All peace-loving people in the world support the Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship. The role played by the Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship over the past five years has increasingly confirmed the outstanding foresight of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Over the past five years, China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries have shown complete unity of action on international issues. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have put forward proposals in the United Nations to defend peace and justice and restore the due dignity of the United Nations, which are in line with the will of the Chinese people, and have waged a solemn struggle to restore our country's legitimate rights in the United Nations, powerfully exposing and combating the US imperialist's actions to turn the United Nations into its own war tool. The fraternal countries have unanimously opposed a series of provocative acts by imperialism headed by US imperialism in Europe and Asia.
    When US imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, threatened our country's security, and invaded our country's territory of Taiwan, our people launched the great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, sending the Chinese People's Volunteers to fight alongside the heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people to strike at the US aggressors. The just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people has been supported by the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and the peace forces of the world, and has achieved a great victory, thus forcing the aggressors to accept the armistice. This is a great victory for the peace and democracy camp. The people of China and North Korea have formed a close fighting friendship in this common struggle. After the Korean armistice, the people of China and North Korea continued to unite together and waged a resolute struggle to ensure the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement and strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The people of our country and the people of the fraternal countries have warmly and selflessly supported the restoration and construction of the people's economy in North Korea after the war.
    The Korean armistice has eased some of the international tensions created by US imperialism. As a result of the Soviet Union's initiative and efforts at the Berlin Conference, the Geneva Conference was held at the end of April this year to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. Our country participated in the Geneva Conference as one of the world's major powers, and our delegation worked closely with the delegations of the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, adhering to the policy of maintaining world peace and international cooperation. The Geneva Conference overcame the obstruction of the US government on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina and finally reached an agreement. The Vietnamese people have always received the consistent sympathy of our people in the revolutionary struggle, and in the future the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will continue to receive the full support of the Chinese people in its efforts to thoroughly implement the peace agreement and restore the national economy. In order to consolidate the victory of the Geneva Conference and maintain peace in Asia and the world, our country, together with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, continues to work hard to oppose the Southeast Asia military alliance pieced together by the United States and the US arming of West Germany, and to strive for the establishment of collective security in Asia and Europe. The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a conference of European countries to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system has been unanimously supported by our country and the fraternal countries; the Soviet Union's statement on the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" also expressed a completely consistent view with our countries.
    Facts have proved that the solidarity and cooperation of the fraternal countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the results of the world peace movement have promoted changes in the international situation that are favorable to the forces of peace and unfavorable to the aggressors. This situation encourages us to make persistent efforts, strengthen unity, and continue to strengthen the forces for defending world peace.
    The fact that our various fraternal countries can form a strong unity is, of course, not a strange and incomprehensible phenomenon, but an inevitable trend in line with the laws of historical development. The relationship between our country and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is a new type of relationship, a socialist international relationship. This relationship is unprecedented. As is well known, the people of our countries are already the masters of their own countries; the goal of the people of all countries is to build a socialist society in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist theory, and the Soviet Union has already built socialism and is advancing victoriously towards communism; the greatest interest of the people of our countries is to achieve this great goal. Therefore, there is no basis for the narrow national interests to oppose each other among our various fraternal countries. On the contrary, the interests of our own people are completely consistent with the interests of the people of all countries, and the support of each of our countries for other countries is precisely to enhance its own strength. So our unity is sincere, permanent, and unbreakable.
    Our unity is the brilliant realization of the internationalist principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. In order to realize this principle, the people of all countries have made a long-term struggle. More than a hundred years ago, the "Communist Manifesto" first announced the great call of "Workers of all countries, unite!" Under this call, in the struggle of the world socialist revolution and the people's democratic revolution, the unity of the working class and working people of all countries has been continuously expanded and strengthened. The victory of the Great October Revolution produced the Soviet socialist state, and the Soviet Union became the center of the unity of the working people of the world. After World War II, a series of people's democratic countries that broke away from the imperialist system appeared in the world, from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, forming a peace, democracy, and socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, including one billion people. This camp is united under the banner of internationalism, supporting each other and fighting together. This is a manifestation of the great victory that the world socialist movement has already achieved. The peace, democracy, and socialist camp has become the dominant force in the development of contemporary world history. Our future is bright.
    The relationship between our fraternal countries is fundamentally different from the relationship between capitalist countries. There can never be any real unity between capitalist countries. Under the seemingly "peaceful" phenomenon, there are full of contradictions and conflicts, and there are factors of mutual warfare hidden, which is a reflection of the anarchic state of the capitalist economy and mutual competition. The most obvious of these is the increasingly acute contradiction between the United States and other capitalist countries. This makes it impossible for capitalist countries to form an equal relationship. The United States is trying to establish its hegemonic position in the capitalist world, forcing other capitalist countries to be reduced to its vassals and war tools. The United States claims to be "friends" with other capitalist countries, but in fact it is taking a manipulative and plunderous imperialist policy. The so-called "cooperation" and "assistance" are actually just used to disguise the most plunderous expansion in capitalist history - the expansion of American monopoly capital. In order to disguise their hegemonic ambitions, the US rulers are particularly eager to boast about their capitalist exploitation and plunder as protecting "freedom"; on the one hand, they have adopted various shameless tricks of rumors, slander, provocation, and sabotage against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and the unity of our countries, exhausting all despicable means. However, since the imperialists do not understand the strength of the unity of the peace and democracy camp and all peace-loving people, all their conspiracies are doomed to bankruptcy.
    Now, our country is building socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in accordance with the general task of the transition period, and the first five-year plan is being successfully carried out. Our socialist cause is part of the world socialist revolution. The socialist system has been brilliantly implemented in the Soviet Union, and it started earlier than us in most people's democratic countries. We must eliminate any kind of exploitation system and basically eliminate the private ownership of the means of production, just as fraternal countries have already done or are doing. We must learn from the example of fraternal countries and do many new things that have never been done before. Therefore, the tasks facing us are very arduous. At the same time, the imperialist encirclement still exists, the danger of imperialist aggression against our country still exists, and the imperialists and their lackeys will never be reconciled to letting our country's economic construction proceed smoothly. They must try every possible means to sabotage our cause and attempt to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. This danger must be fully estimated. Therefore, the environment we are in is very complicated. All this shows that the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to our country, the unity between our country and the fraternal countries in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp, and the victorious development of the unity of the people who love peace all over the world and the struggle to defend world peace are indispensable conditions for the victory of our country's socialist construction. The people throughout the country should understand that our country's friendly unity with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is the fundamental policy of our country's foreign policy. The more consolidated our unity is, the stronger our strength will be, the more guaranteed the victory of our socialist construction will be, the more the development of world peace and the development of normal diplomatic relations between countries can be promoted, and the more the imperialist conspiracy of aggressive war will suffer a shameful failure.
    It is the sacred task of our people to strive to maintain and strengthen our country's unity with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Our unity is in the interests of our people. Any destruction of our unity by anyone from any aspect is an infringement on the interests of the Chinese people. It is necessary to continue to strengthen the publicity and education combining patriotism and internationalism throughout the country. It is necessary to further publicize Sino-Soviet friendship and the friendship between China and the people's democratic countries, to publicize opposition to imperialism and defense of world peace; to educate the people to always improve their revolutionary vigilance; to oppose the erroneous ideas of bourgeois nationalism and the enemy's reactionary propaganda. This is the content that should be emphasized in socialist ideological education. It is necessary to strengthen economic cooperation and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. It is necessary to continuously develop the world democratic market, further promote the universal prosperity of the economies of all countries and the common prosperity of the cultures of all countries, and strengthen the strength of our country's economic construction and cultural construction with the assistance of the fraternal countries; at the same time, do everything possible to provide assistance to the cause of the fraternal countries. It is necessary to work harder to learn from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. It is necessary to strengthen our country's unity with the fraternal countries in the international struggle against aggressive wars and for lasting peace; at the same time, in accordance with the five principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence put forward in the statements separately issued by the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese prime ministers, strive to enhance our country's peaceful and friendly relations with all countries in the world, especially Asian countries. With the support of the peace, democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people who love peace all over the world, we must resolutely oppose the US imperialist policy of hostility towards our country and aggression against our country, oppose the US establishment of opposing military blocs in the Far East, oppose US interference in our internal affairs, invasion of our country's territory of Taiwan, and attempt to expand the criminal conspiracy of armed intervention and war threats against our country; we must liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, to complete our country's complete reunification and guarantee peace in the Far East and the world; we must actively participate in the struggle to further ease the international situation, and continue to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the thorough implementation of the Geneva Conference's agreement on restoring peace in Indochina.
    Chairman Mao instructed in his opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China: "Our general task is to unite the people of the whole country, strive for the support of all international friends, and strive to build a great socialist country, and strive to defend international peace and develop the cause of human progress." This is the great program of action for our people. In the preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, our people have solemnly written down our country's unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. This shows that our people will always steadfastly and unswervingly be faithful to our great unity and make it infinitely consolidated and developed.
    The Chinese people, united with the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, hold high the banner of internationalism and march towards common victory with full confidence!
