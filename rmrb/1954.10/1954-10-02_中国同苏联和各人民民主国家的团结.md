    Solidarity Between China and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries
    Wu Yuzhang
    The People's Republic of China has been established for five years. As our people are warmly celebrating National Day, progressive people all over the world are congratulating and cheering our country. What is particularly exciting is that the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev and the government delegations of various people's democratic countries have come to our capital, Beijing, with the deep friendship of the people of all fraternal countries to participate in the National Day celebrations. This unprecedented grand event is a remarkable symbol of the great unity between our country and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    The establishment of the People's Republic of China is the result of the victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution with the support of the world's revolutionary forces led by the Soviet Union; thereby greatly strengthening the strength of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist camp. The establishment of the People's Republic of China marks the beginning of a new period in the development of friendship between the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. Chairman Mao taught us on the eve of the founding of the country in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that we must resolutely "lean to the side of socialism"; in his opening speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he instructed that "internationally, we must unite with all countries and peoples who love peace and freedom, first of all with the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries." Over the past five years, our people have steadfastly implemented Chairman Mao's instructions; the unity between our country and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed, becoming an invincible force.
    The day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government was the first to recognize the People's Republic of China and establish diplomatic relations with our country. At the time, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Outer Mongolia, the German Democratic Republic, Albania, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and other countries all swiftly established diplomatic relations with our country.
    Shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong personally led the Chinese government delegation to Moscow and, together with the responsible comrades of the Soviet government headed by Comrade Stalin, discussed important political and economic issues related to the two countries, and signed the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" of great significance in February 1950, solidifying the unity of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union and forming an unbreakable alliance. The light of this treaty will forever shine in history. The two countries also signed the "Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou and Dalian" and the "Agreement on Loans to the People's Republic of China" at the same time, followed by other agreements, which have had a very important effect on the development of our national cause. In the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance, the Soviet Union has returned to our country free of charge the Chinese Changchun Railway, which was originally jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, and the enterprises and other properties in Northeast China that the Soviet Union obtained from Japan. The Soviet Union helped our country overcome the difficulties in compiling the first five-year plan for national construction. The Soviet Union provided systematic economic and technical assistance for the construction and reconstruction of 141 large-scale enterprises in our country. These enterprises are the backbone of our country's industrial construction projects during the first five-year plan. After these enterprises are all completed and put into operation, our country's socialist industrialization will gain a solid foundation. At the same time, the Soviet Union has also provided tremendous assistance in our country's restoration and development of transportation, agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, the establishment of strong state-owned and cooperative commerce, the construction of people's cultural and educational undertakings, and the training of cadres. This great, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance has never been seen in human history.
    In order to build the country, Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party have repeatedly called on the people of the whole country to earnestly learn from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's experience in building socialism is a complete scientific summary of more than 30 years of practice. With the guidance of these experiences, our people's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation can be carried out smoothly. Soviet socialist culture represents the vanguard of world cultural development, and it is a model for our construction of a new culture. Learning from the Soviet Union is the direction of work for all departments of our country's national construction. Over the past five years, our people have accepted and disseminated Soviet experience through various methods, and the upsurge of learning is increasing day by day. The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" campaign in 1952 and the "Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction," which will soon open in Beijing, are of great significance in promoting our people's learning from the Soviet Union. In order to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, the Chinese people have organized the widespread mass organization "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association" and carried out much work.
    Similarly, our country's fraternal friendship and political, economic, and cultural cooperation with the people's democratic countries are also being consolidated and developed day by day. Our country and the people's democratic countries have successively signed trade agreements, cultural cooperation agreements, and various other agreements. Our country's trade volume with the people's democratic countries has been increasing year by year. In 1953, our country's total trade value with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries was four times that of 1950. In 1953, our country's total trade value with the people's democratic countries increased by 25 percent compared with 1952. Last year, the industrial and agricultural machinery such as machine tools and power machines imported by our country from various people's democratic countries accounted for more than 51 percent of the total import value, an increase of nearly three times compared with 1952. This not only reflects the enthusiastic support of the fraternal countries for our country's economic construction, but also powerfully illustrates the brilliant achievements of the fraternal countries in industrial construction with the assistance of the Soviet Union. Our country has also exported important mineral products and agricultural and sideline products to the fraternal countries, trying its best to meet the needs of various countries in developing production and improving people's lives, and giving full play to the role of exchanging what one has for what one needs. Our country's cultural exchanges with various countries are also expanding day by day. Mao Zedong's works are being translated into various languages and widely disseminated among the people of various countries, becoming extremely valuable theoretical works. The scientific and educational institutions of various countries maintain close contact with our country's relevant institutions. Through holding various exhibitions, organizing art troupe performances, exchanging students, mutually translating books, introducing films and other extensive activities, the common prosperity of the cultures of various countries has been promoted, and these activities have become an indispensable factor in the cultural life of the people of various countries.
    Over the past five years, hundreds of delegations from our country and the fraternal countries have visited each other, conveying the friendship and love between the people. The patriotic spirit, unparalleled labor enthusiasm, and strong fighting will demonstrated by the people of various countries in the cause of socialist construction and the struggle for national reunification have given our people unlimited encouragement. It is particularly worth mentioning that the Mongolian People's Republic government delegation headed by Premier Tsedenbal visited our country in 1952, the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea led by Premier Kim Il-sung visited our country in 1953, Premier Zhou Enlai's talks with President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the Sino-Vietnamese border during the Geneva Conference this year, Vice Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam visited our country after the Geneva Conference, and the Chinese government delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai successively visited the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Mongolia after visiting the Soviet Union, greatly enhancing the unity between us and the fraternal countries. In November 1953, China and North Korea concluded an agreement on economic and cultural cooperation, and on July 25, 1954, the premiers of China and the German Democratic Republic issued a joint communiqué, demonstrating the mutual concern and support of the Chinese, North Korean, and German people in the cause of peace.
    Facts have proved that the mutual concern and close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have played a tremendous role in ensuring common economic and cultural prosperity. The rapid completion of our country's economic recovery work over the past five years and the vigorous development of planned economic construction work are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Our people sincerely thank you for this assistance. This cooperation is the comradely mutual support within a peaceful and democratic family of countries whose people have already grasped power, and its foundation, as Comrade Stalin once pointed out, is "the sincere desire for mutual assistance and the pursuit of common economic prosperity." Therefore, our cooperation is close and no one can destroy it, and it will develop immeasurably with the common prosperity of the countries.
    At the same time, over the past five years, our country, in coordination with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, has waged a resolute struggle to defend world peace, oppose aggressive wars, and strive to ease international tensions. In this struggle, the Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship is the greatest pillar. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is permeated with the spirit of fighting for peace and universal security, and its main goal is to jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or other countries that collude with Japan in any form of aggressive acts. This has seriously hit the US imperialist's sinister conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a war base for launching aggression against the Soviet Union and China. Over the past five years, China and the Soviet Union have contributed fully to participating in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security with a spirit of faithful cooperation, and have consulted each other on major international issues related to the two countries. The Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship stands like a fortress, powerfully guaranteeing peace in the Far East and the world. All peace-loving people in the world support the Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship. The role played by the Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship over the past five years has increasingly confirmed the outstanding foresight of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Over the past five years, China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries have shown complete unity of action on international issues. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have put forward proposals in the United Nations to defend peace and justice and restore the due dignity of the United Nations, which are in line with the will of the Chinese people, and have waged a solemn struggle to restore our country's legitimate rights in the United Nations, powerfully exposing and combating the US imperialist's actions to turn the United Nations into its own war tool. The fraternal countries have unanimously opposed a series of provocative acts by imperialism headed by US imperialism in Europe and Asia.
    When US imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, threatened our country's security, and invaded our country's territory of Taiwan, our people launched the great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, sending the Chinese People's Volunteers to fight alongside the heroic Korean People's Army and the Korean people to strike at the US aggressors. The just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people has been supported by the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and the peace forces of the world, and has achieved a great victory, thus forcing the aggressors to accept the armistice. This is a great victory for the peace and democracy camp. The people of China and North Korea have formed a close fighting friendship in this common struggle. After the Korean armistice, the people of China and North Korea continued to unite together and waged a resolute struggle to ensure the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement and strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The people of our country and the people of the fraternal countries have warmly and selflessly supported the restoration and construction of the people's economy in North Korea after the war.
    The Korean armistice has eased some of the international tensions created by US imperialism. As a result of the Soviet Union's initiative and efforts at the Berlin Conference, the Geneva Conference was held at the end of April this year to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. Our country participated in the Geneva Conference as one of the world's major powers, and our delegation worked closely with the delegations of the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, adhering to the policy of maintaining world peace and international cooperation. The Geneva Conference overcame the obstruction of the US government on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina and finally reached an agreement. The Vietnamese people have always received the consistent sympathy of our people in the revolutionary struggle, and in the future the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will continue to receive the full support of the Chinese people in its efforts to thoroughly implement the peace agreement and restore the national economy. In order to consolidate the victory of the Geneva Conference and maintain peace in Asia and the world, our country, together with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, continues to work hard to oppose the Southeast Asia military alliance pieced together by the United States and the US arming of West Germany, and to strive for the establishment of collective security in Asia and Europe. The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a conference of European countries to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system has been unanimously supported by our country and the fraternal countries; the Soviet Union's statement on the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" also expressed a completely consistent view with our countries.
    Facts have proved that the solidarity and cooperation of the fraternal countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the results of the world peace movement have promoted changes in the international situation that are favorable to the forces of peace and unfavorable to the aggressors. This situation encourages us to make persistent efforts, strengthen unity, and continue to strengthen the forces for defending world peace.
    The fact that our various fraternal countries can form a strong unity is, of course, not a strange and incomprehensible phenomenon, but an inevitable trend in line with the laws of historical development. The relationship between our country and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is a new type of relationship, a socialist international relationship. This relationship is unprecedented. As is well known, the people of our countries are already the masters of their own countries; the goal of the people of all countries is to build a socialist society in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist theory, and the Soviet Union has already built socialism and is advancing victoriously towards communism; the greatest interest of the people of our countries is to achieve this great goal. Therefore, there is no basis for the narrow national interests to oppose each other among our various fraternal countries. On the contrary, the interests of our own people are completely consistent with the interests of the people of all countries, and the support of each of our countries for other countries is precisely to enhance its own strength. So our unity is sincere, permanent, and unbreakable.
    Our unity is the brilliant realization of the internationalist principles of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. In order to realize this principle, the people of all countries have made a long-term struggle. More than a hundred years ago, the "Communist Manifesto" first announced the great call of "Workers of all countries, unite!" Under this call, in the struggle of the world socialist revolution and the people's democratic revolution, the unity of the working class and working people of all countries has been continuously expanded and strengthened. The victory of the Great October Revolution produced the Soviet socialist state, and the Soviet Union became the center of the unity of the working people of the world. After World War II, a series of people's democratic countries that broke away from the imperialist system appeared in the world, from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, forming a peace, democracy, and socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, including one billion people. This camp is united under the banner of internationalism, supporting each other and fighting together. This is a manifestation of the great victory that the world socialist movement has already achieved. The peace, democracy, and socialist camp has become the dominant force in the development of contemporary world history. Our future is bright.
    The relationship between our fraternal countries is fundamentally different from the relationship between capitalist countries. There can never be any real unity between capitalist countries. Under the seemingly "peaceful" phenomenon, there are full of contradictions and conflicts, and there are factors of mutual warfare hidden, which is a reflection of the anarchic state of the capitalist economy and mutual competition. The most obvious of these is the increasingly acute contradiction between the United States and other capitalist countries. This makes it impossible for capitalist countries to form an equal relationship. The United States is trying to establish its hegemonic position in the capitalist world, forcing other capitalist countries to be reduced to its vassals and war tools. The United States claims to be "friends" with other capitalist countries, but in fact it is taking a manipulative and plunderous imperialist policy. The so-called "cooperation" and "assistance" are actually just used to disguise the most plunderous expansion in capitalist history - the expansion of American monopoly capital. In order to disguise their hegemonic ambitions, the US rulers are particularly eager to boast about their capitalist exploitation and plunder as protecting "freedom"; on the one hand, they have adopted various shameless tricks of rumors, slander, provocation, and sabotage against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and the unity of our countries, exhausting all despicable means. However, since the imperialists do not understand the strength of the unity of the peace and democracy camp and all peace-loving people, all their conspiracies are doomed to bankruptcy.
    Now, our country is building socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in accordance with the general task of the transition period, and the first five-year plan is being successfully carried out. Our socialist cause is part of the world socialist revolution. The socialist system has been brilliantly implemented in the Soviet Union, and it started earlier than us in most people's democratic countries. We must eliminate any kind of exploitation system and basically eliminate the private ownership of the means of production, just as fraternal countries have already done or are doing. We must learn from the example of fraternal countries and do many new things that have never been done before. Therefore, the tasks facing us are very arduous. At the same time, the imperialist encirclement still exists, the danger of imperialist aggression against our country still exists, and the imperialists and their lackeys will never be reconciled to letting our country's economic construction proceed smoothly. They must try every possible means to sabotage our cause and attempt to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. This danger must be fully estimated. Therefore, the environment we are in is very complicated. All this shows that the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to our country, the unity between our country and the fraternal countries in the peace, democracy, and socialist camp, and the victorious development of the unity of the people who love peace all over the world and the struggle to defend world peace are indispensable conditions for the victory of our country's socialist construction. The people throughout the country should understand that our country's friendly unity with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is the fundamental policy of our country's foreign policy. The more consolidated our unity is, the stronger our strength will be, the more guaranteed the victory of our socialist construction will be, the more the development of world peace and the development of normal diplomatic relations between countries can be promoted, and the more the imperialist conspiracy of aggressive war will suffer a shameful failure.
    It is the sacred task of our people to strive to maintain and strengthen our country's unity with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Our unity is in the interests of our people. Any destruction of our unity by anyone from any aspect is an infringement on the interests of the Chinese people. It is necessary to continue to strengthen the publicity and education combining patriotism and internationalism throughout the country. It is necessary to further publicize Sino-Soviet friendship and the friendship between China and the people's democratic countries, to publicize opposition to imperialism and defense of world peace; to educate the people to always improve their revolutionary vigilance; to oppose the erroneous ideas of bourgeois nationalism and the enemy's reactionary propaganda. This is the content that should be emphasized in socialist ideological education. It is necessary to strengthen economic cooperation and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. It is necessary to continuously develop the world democratic market, further promote the universal prosperity of the economies of all countries and the common prosperity of the cultures of all countries, and strengthen the strength of our country's economic construction and cultural construction with the assistance of the fraternal countries; at the same time, do everything possible to provide assistance to the cause of the fraternal countries. It is necessary to work harder to learn from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. It is necessary to strengthen our country's unity with the fraternal countries in the international struggle against aggressive wars and for lasting peace; at the same time, in accordance with the five principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence put forward in the statements separately issued by the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese prime ministers, strive to enhance our country's peaceful and friendly relations with all countries in the world, especially Asian countries. With the support of the peace, democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people who love peace all over the world, we must resolutely oppose the US imperialist policy of hostility towards our country and aggression against our country, oppose the US establishment of opposing military blocs in the Far East, oppose US interference in our internal affairs, invasion of our country's territory of Taiwan, and attempt to expand the criminal conspiracy of armed intervention and war threats against our country; we must liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, to complete our country's complete reunification and guarantee peace in the Far East and the world; we must actively participate in the struggle to further ease the international situation, and continue to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the thorough implementation of the Geneva Conference's agreement on restoring peace in Indochina.
    Chairman Mao instructed in his opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China: "Our general task is to unite the people of the whole country, strive for the support of all international friends, and strive to build a great socialist country, and strive to defend international peace and develop the cause of human progress." This is the great program of action for our people. In the preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, our people have solemnly written down our country's unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. This shows that our people will always steadfastly and unswervingly be faithful to our great unity and make it infinitely consolidated and developed.
    The Chinese people, united with the people of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, hold high the banner of internationalism and march towards common victory with full confidence!

    中国同苏联和各人民民主国家的团结
    吴玉章
    中华人民共和国成立已经五周年了。当着我国人民正在热烈庆祝国庆节的时候，全世界进步人类都在向我们的国家庆贺欢呼。特别令人无比兴奋的是以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府代表团和各人民民主国家政府代表团带着各兄弟国家人民的深厚友谊来到我国首都北京参加国庆大典。这个空前盛会正是我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的伟大团结的显著标志。
    中华人民共和国的成立是中国人民民主革命在以苏联为首的世界各国革命力量的支持下取得胜利的结果；从而又大大地加强了世界和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量。中华人民共和国的成立标志着中国人民和世界各国人民的友谊的发展开始了一个新的时期。毛主席在开国前夕就曾经在“论人民民主专政”一文中教导我们必须坚决“倒向社会主义一边”；在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议的开幕词中又指示我们：“在国际上，我们必须和一切爱好和平自由的国家和人民团结在一起，首先是和苏联及各新民主国家团结在一起”。五年来，我国人民坚定不移地执行了毛主席的指示；我国和苏联及各人民民主国家的团结正在日益巩固和发展起来，成为不可战胜的力量。
    中华人民共和国成立的第二天，苏联政府就首先承认了中华人民共和国，与我国建立了外交关系。同时，保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、蒙古、德意志民主共和国、阿尔巴尼亚、越南民主共和国等国家都迅速地与我国建立了外交关系。
    中华人民共和国成立以后不久，毛泽东同志亲自率领中国政府代表团到莫斯科和以斯大林同志为首的苏联政府负责同志共同商讨了有关两国的重大政治问题和经济问题，在一九五○年二月签订了具有伟大意义的“中苏友好同盟互助条约”，使中苏两大国人民的团结固定下来并结成了牢不可破的同盟。这个条约的光芒将永远辉耀在历史上。中苏两国还同时签订了“关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定”、“关于贷款给中华人民共和国的协定”，随后又签订了其他各项协定，对我国国家事业的发展有着极重要的作用。根据友好互助精神，苏联已经将原由中苏共管的中国长春铁路和苏联在中国东北从日本手中获得的企业和其他财产无偿地交还我国。苏联帮助了我国克服编制国家建设的第一个五年计划中的困难。苏联对我国新建与改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的企业给予了系统的经济援助和技术援助。这些企业是我国在第一个五年计划期间工业建设项目的骨干。这些企业全部建成并开工以后，就将使我国社会主义工业化获得一个稳固的基础。同时，在我国恢复和发展交通运输事业和农林水利事业、建立强大的国营商业和合作社商业、建设人民的文化教育事业和培养干部等各个方面，苏联也都给予了巨大的援助。这种伟大的、全面的、长期的、无私的援助是人类历史上从来没有过的。
    为了建设国家，毛主席和中国共产党再三号召全国人民要认真学习苏联。苏联建设社会主义的经验是三十多年来实践的完整的科学总结，有了这些经验的指导，我国人民的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造就得以顺利前进。苏联社会主义文化代表着世界文化发展的先锋，它是我们建设新文化的范例。学习苏联，这是我国国家建设事业中一切部门工作的方向。五年来，我国人民通过了各种方式接受和传播苏联经验，学习的热潮正在日益高涨。一九五二年“中苏友好月”运动和即将在北京开幕的“苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会”对于推动我国人民学习苏联有着很大的意义。为了加强中苏友好，中国人民组织了广泛群众性的“中苏友好协会”，进行了许多工作。
    同样，我国同各人民民主国家的兄弟般的友谊和政治上、经济上和文化上的合作也是在日益巩固和发展起来。我国和各人民民主国家先后签订了贸易协定、文化合作协定以及其他方面的各种协定。我国对人民民主国家的贸易额逐年不断增长。一九五三年我国对苏联及人民民主国家的贸易总值为一九五○年的四倍。一九五三年我国对人民民主国家的贸易总值比较一九五二年就增加了百分之二十五。去年我国从各人民民主国家进口的工作母机、动力机等工业和农业机械约占总进口额的百分之五十一以上，比一九五二年增加了将近三倍。这不仅反映了各兄弟国家对我国经济建设的热情支援，也有力地说明了各兄弟国家在苏联援助下工业建设的辉煌成就。我国也向各兄弟国家输出了重要的矿产品和农副产品，尽量地满足各国发展生产和提高人民生活的需要，充分发挥了有无相通的作用。我国同各国的文化交流也日益扩大。毛泽东的著作正在被翻译成各国文字，在各国人民中广泛地传播，成为极受珍贵的理论著作。各国的科学教育机关与我国的有关机关经常保持密切的接触。通过举办各种展览会、组织艺术团演出、互相交换留学生、互助翻译书籍、介绍电影等广泛活动，促进了各国文化的共同繁荣，这些活动已经成为各国人民文化生活中不可缺少的因素。
    五年来，我国同各兄弟国家的各种代表团曾经数百次互相访问，传达人民之间的友谊和热爱。各国人民在社会主义建设事业和争取祖国统一的斗争中所表现出来的爱国主义精神、无比的劳动热情和坚强的战斗意志，给予了我国人民以无限的鼓舞。特别值得提出的是，一九五二年以泽登巴尔总理为首
  的蒙古人民共和国政府代表团访问我国、一九五三年朝鲜民主主义人民共和国金日成首相率领的政府
  代表团访问我国、今年日内瓦会议期间周恩来总理与越南人民共和国胡志明主席在中越边境的会谈、
  日内瓦会议后越南人民共和国范文同副总理访问我
  国、周恩来总理率领的我国政府代表团在访问苏联
  先后相继访问了德意志民主共和国、波兰和蒙古等
  兄弟国家，大大地增进了我们和各兄弟国家之间的
  团结。一九五三年十一月中朝两国缔结了经济及文
  化合作协定，一九五四年七月二十五日我国和德意
  志民主共和国两国总理发表了会谈公报，表现了中
  朝和中德人民在和平事业中的互相关怀和支持。
      事实证明：中国同苏联和各人民民主国家之间
  的相互关切和亲密合作，对于保证共同的经济和文
  化繁荣已经发生了巨大的作用。我国五年来经济恢
  复工作的迅速完成以及有计划的经济建设工作的蓬
  勃展开，是和苏联及各人民民主国家的无私援助分
  不开的。我国人民衷心感谢这种援助。这种合作是
  胜利了的人民已经掌握了政权的国家在一个和平民
  主的大家庭内部的同志式的相互支持，它的基础，
  正如斯大林同志所曾经指出过的，乃是“互相帮助
  和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望”。因此，我们的合作是紧密的、没有人能够破坏的，它将随着各国的共同昌盛而不可限量地发展起来。
    同时，五年来，我国同苏联和各人民民主国家协同一致地为保卫世界和平和反对侵略战争、为争取缓和国际紧张局势进行了坚决的斗争。在这个斗争中，中苏友好同盟是最伟大的支柱。中苏友好同盟互助条约贯串着为和平和普遍安全而斗争的精神，它以共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略为主要目标。这就严重地打击了美帝国主义复活日本军国主义、把日本变成发动侵略苏联和中国的战争基地的罪恶阴谋。五年来，中苏两国以忠诚的合作精神，在参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的的国际活动上贡献了充分的力量，在有关两国的重大国际问题上彼此进行了协商。中苏友好同盟像堡垒一样巍然屹立，有力地保证了远东及世界的和平。全世界一切爱好和平的人民都拥护中苏友好同盟。五年来中苏友好同盟所发生的作用，日益证实了斯大林同志和毛泽东同志的卓越远见。
    五年来，中国同苏联和各人民民主国家，在国际问题上表现了行动的完全一致。苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表在联合国内为保卫和平和正义、恢复联合国应有的尊严，提出了合乎中国人民意志的主张，为恢复我国在联合国的合法权利而进行了严正的斗争，有力地揭露与打击了美国帝国主义把联合国变成自己的战争工具的行动。各兄弟国家一致地反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义在欧洲和亚洲的一系列的挑衅行为。
    当美国帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争，并威胁我国安全和侵占我国领土台湾的时候，我国人民展开了伟大的抗美援朝运动，派遣了中国人民志愿军与英雄的朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民一道打击美国侵略者。中朝人民的正义斗争，得到了以苏联为首的各人民民主国家和全世界和平力量的支持，取得了伟大的胜利，因而迫使侵略者不得不接受停战。这是和平、民主阵营的伟大胜利。中朝两国人民已经在这个共同斗争中结成了血肉相连的战斗友谊。在朝鲜停战以后，中朝两国人民继续团结在一起，为保障停战协定的彻底实施、争取和平解决朝鲜问题而进行了坚决的斗争。我国人民和各兄弟国家的人民一道热忱无私地支援了朝鲜战后人民经济的恢复和建设。
    朝鲜停战使美国帝国主义制造的国际紧张局势有了一些缓和。由于苏联在柏林会议上的倡议和努力的结果，今年四月底得以举行日内瓦会议以分别讨论和平解决朝鲜问题及恢复印度支那和平问题。我国作为世界大国之一参加了日内瓦会议，我国代表团同苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国代表团密切合作，坚持了维护世界和平和国际合作的政策。日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平问题上克服了美国政府的阻挠，终于达成了协议。越南人民在革命斗争中曾经得到我国人民一贯的同情，今后越南民主共和国在争取和平协议的彻底实施和恢复国民经济的工作中，将继续得到中国人民的充分支持。为了巩固日内瓦会议的胜利，维护亚洲及世界和平，我国和苏联及各人民民主国家一道，继续努力，反对美国所拼凑的东南亚军事联盟和美国武装西德的活动，争取建立亚洲和欧洲的集体安全。苏联关于召开欧洲国家会议讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议为我国和各兄弟国家所一致支持；苏联关于“东南亚集体防务条约”问题发表的声明也表示了与我们各国完全一致的意见。
    事实证明：以苏联为首的和平、民主阵营各兄弟国家的团结合作以及全世界和平运动的结果，已经促使国际形势发生了有利于和平势力、不利于侵略者的变化。这种形势，鼓励我们再接再厉，加强团结，以继续加强保卫世界和平的力量。
    我们各个兄弟国家之所以能够形成强大的团结，当然不是什么奇怪的和不可理解的现象，而是合乎历史发展规律的必然趋势。我国同苏联和各人民民主国家之间的关系是一种新型的关系，是社会主义性质的国际关系。这种关系是史无前例的。如所周知，我们各国人民都已经是自己国家的主人；各国人民的目标都是要根据马克思列宁主义学说建设社会主义社会，而苏联则已经建成了社会主义并正向共产主义胜利迈进；我们各国人民的最大利益就是为了达到这个伟大的目标。因此，在我们各兄弟国家之间没有什么狭隘的民族利益互相对立的基础，恰恰相反，我们本国人民的利益是和各国人民的利益完全一致的，我们每一个国家对于其他国家的支持也正是增强了自己的力量。所以我们的团结是真诚的、永久的、牢不可破的。
    我们的团结是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的国际主义原则的光辉的实现。为了实现这个原则，各国人民曾经作了长时期的斗争。一百多年以前，“共产党宣言”第一次宣布了“全世界无产者，联合起来！”这个伟大的号召，在这个号召之下，在世界社会主义革命和人民民主革命斗争中，各国工人阶级和劳动人民的团结不断得到扩大和加强。伟大十月革命的胜利产生了苏维埃社会主义国家，苏联成了全世界劳动人民团结的中心。第二次世界大战以后，世界上出现了从中国和朝鲜直到捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利这一系列脱离帝国主义体系的人民民主国家，组成了以苏联为领导力量的包括十亿人口的和平、民主、社会主义阵营。这个阵营在国际主义的旗帜之下团结起来，相互支持，共同奋斗。这是世界社会主义运动业已获得伟大胜利的表现。和平、民主、社会主义阵营已经成为当代世界历史发展的主导力量。我们的前途正是光芒万丈。
    我们兄弟国家间的关系是和资本主义国家之间的关系根本不同的。资本主义各国之间永远不可能有什么真正的团结，在那种外表上似乎“平安无事”的现象之下，充满着矛盾冲突，潜伏着相互战争的因素，这是资本主义经济无政府状态及相互竞争的反映。其中最为明显的是美国和其他资本主义国家之间的矛盾日益尖锐。这就使得资本主义各国之间形成不平等的关系。美国正在力图建立它在资本主义世界的独霸地位，迫使其他各资本主义国家降为它的附庸和战争工具。美国对其他各资本主义国家口称是“朋友”而实际上采取着操纵和掠夺的帝国主义政策，所谓“合作”和“援助”实际上不过是用来掩饰资本主义历史上最富于掠夺性的扩张——美国独占资本的扩张的招牌而已。美国统治者为了掩饰自己的独霸企图，特别卖力地一方面把他们那种资本主义剥削和掠夺吹嘘作保护“自由”；一方面对于苏联和各人民民主国家以及我们各国的团结采取了各种造谣诽谤、挑拨离间、阴谋破坏的无耻伎俩，极尽一切卑劣手段的能事。但是，帝国主义者既然不懂得和平、民主阵营和一切爱好和平的人民团结的力量，他们的一切阴谋就是注定要破产的。
    现在，我们的国家正在中国共产党的领导下循着过渡时期的总任务建设社会主义，第一个五年计划正在胜利地进行。我们的社会主义事业是世界社会主义革命事业的一部分。社会主义制度在苏联已经光辉地实行了，在多数人民民主国家中也比我们开始得更早。我们要像兄弟国家所已经做过或正在做的那样消灭任何种类的剥削制度和在基本上消灭生产资料私有制度。我们要学习兄弟国家的榜样，做很多从来没有做过的新的工作。所以，我们面临的任务是十分艰巨的。同时，帝国主义的包围仍然存在，帝国主义侵略我国的危险就仍然存在，帝国主义者和他们的走狗决不会甘心让我国经济建设顺利进行，他们一定要千方百计来破坏我们的事业，企图进行反革命的复辟。这种危险性必须充分地被估计到。所以，我们所处的环境是十分复杂的。所有这一切都说明，苏联和各人民民主国家对我国的援助、我国同和平、民主、社会主义阵营各兄弟国家的团结以及全世界爱好和平的人民的团结和保卫世界和平的斗争的胜利开展，乃是我国社会主义建设事业胜利所必不可少的条件。我们全国人民都应当了解：我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的友好团结是我国外交政策的根本方针。我们的团结越是巩固，我们的力量就越是强大，我们的社会主义建设事业的胜利就越有保证，世界和平事业的发展和国际间正常外交关系的发展就越能推进，而帝国主义的侵略战争阴谋就越会遭受可耻的失败。
    我国人民的神圣任务就是要努力维护和增强我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的团结。我们的团结是我国人民的利益。任何人从任何方面对于我们的团结的破坏，都是对于中国人民利益的侵害。必须在全国范围内继续加强爱国主义与国际主义相结合的宣传教育。要更加深入地宣传中苏友好和中国与各人民民主国家的友好，宣传反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平；要教育人民时时提高革命警惕性；要反对资产阶级民族主义的错误思想和敌人的反动宣传。这是社会主义思想教育中应当着重注意的内容。必须加强同苏联和各人民民主国家之间的经济合作和文化交流。要不断发展世界民主市场，进一步促进各国经济的普遍高涨和各国文化的共同繁荣，在兄弟国家的援助下加强我国经济建设和文化建设的力量；同时尽一切可能为兄弟国家的事业提供帮助。必须更加努力向苏联和各人民民主国家学习。必须加强我国同各兄弟国家在反对侵略战争、争取持久和平的国际斗争中的团结一致；同时，根据中印、中缅总理会谈所分别发表的声明中提出的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，努力增进我国与世界各国特别是亚洲各国的和平友好关系。在以苏联为首的和平、民主阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，一定要坚决反对美国帝国主义敌视我国和侵略我国的政策，反对美国在远东建立对立的军事集团，反对美国干涉我国内政、侵占我国领土台湾、企图扩大对我国的武装干涉和战争威胁的罪恶阴谋；一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，以完成我国的完全统一，保障远东和世界和平；一定要积极参加争取国际局势进一步缓和的斗争，并继续为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决和彻底实现日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议而努力。
    毛主席在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的开幕词中指示说：“我们的总任务是：团结全国人民，争取一切国际朋友的支援，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗，为了保卫国际和平和发展人类进步事业而奋斗。”这是我国人民的伟大行动纲领。在中华人民共和国宪法的序言中，我国人民已经庄严地写下了我国和苏联及各人民民主国家的牢不可破的友谊。这就表明我们人民将永远坚定不移地忠实于我们的伟大团结，使它无限地巩固和发展起来。
    中国人民同苏联和各人民民主国家的人民团结在一起，更高地举起国际主义的旗帜，满怀信心地朝着共同的胜利迈进！
