    [News from Our Newspaper] The planned supply of cotton cloth has been successfully unfolded in various regions. Throughout the broad urban and rural areas of the country, except for a few individual regions, the supply of cotton cloth against coupons has begun successively from September 15th. The markets in various regions are stable, and the sales of cotton cloth are normal.
    The broad masses of people throughout the country warmly support the measures of unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and unified purchase of cotton. Based on the improvement in their clothing and fabric use since liberation and in recent years, and the benefits gained from the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain and oil, the urban and rural working people unanimously believe that "implementing unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and unified purchase of cotton is a good way to ensure that everyone has clothes to wear, the market is stable, and national construction proceeds smoothly." Many people happily said after receiving their cloth purchase coupons: "The government issuing us cloth purchase coupons is like putting enough cloth in our hands, so we don't have to worry about unscrupulous merchants engaging in speculation." "With planned supply of grain and cooking oil, and planned supply of cotton cloth, life is even more stable!" Workers and farmers in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and other places are guaranteeing to support the implementation of this measure with practical actions such as saving raw cotton, weaving more good cloth, and increasing cotton production. Many cadres, workers, and farmers in Beijing, Xi'an, Shandong, Henan, and other places have begun to contemplate and spread methods for saving cotton cloth and cotton.
    At present, all cotton cloth produced in various regions, except for a small portion of cotton cloth woven entirely from hand-spun yarn, has been purchased by the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has already begun actively allocating cloth according to the planned supply, and there is a sufficient guarantee of goods. In order to better supply consumer needs, state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies, cooperatives, etc., in many regions such as Qingdao and Shenyang have strengthened their work in allocating goods and investigating mass consumption needs.
    Regarding private cotton cloth businesses, the people's governments at all levels are actively carrying out industry-wide arrangements in accordance with policies. Before the implementation of unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth, the vast majority of private cotton cloth wholesalers had already been carefully dealt with and properly arranged by the people's governments at all levels. At present, private cotton cloth retailers have generally carried out registration of inventory and other tasks in accordance with regulations, and a large number of private cotton cloth retailers have established distribution, agency sales and other relationships with state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies. The cotton cloth supply and marketing business in various markets has basically been incorporated into the national plan. After private cotton cloth retailers became distributors and agents for the state, the enthusiasm of store employees has greatly increased, and many capitalists have also expressed their intention to actively operate. Private cotton cloth merchants in various regions sell cloth at the retail prices stipulated by the state, and unreasonable price phenomena have been basically overcome. In Guangzhou, the retail prices of cotton cloth by private merchants have generally decreased by 3 to 7 percent. In Nanjing and other places, many private cotton cloth retailers who distribute cloth for the state have begun to gain the trust of consumers and new developments have emerged in their business after improving their service attitude and management. Cotton cloth reproduction industries in various regions have generally carried out registration of inventory, preparation of plans, and other tasks, and the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company has begun to supply cloth in a planned manner according to their normal needs.

    各地顺利展开棉布计划供应工作
    【本报讯】棉布计划供应工作已在各地顺利展开。全国广大城市和农村，除个别地区外，都已从九月十五日起先后开始凭证供应棉布。各地市场平稳，棉布销售情况正常。
    全国广大人民热烈拥护棉布统购统销和棉花统购的措施。城乡劳动人民根据解放前后和最近几年来自己穿衣用布改善的情况，和实行粮、油统购统销得到的好处，一致认为“实行棉布统购统销和棉花统购，是保证人人都有衣穿、市场稳定和国家建设顺利进行的好办法”。许多人拿到购布证后高兴地说：“政府发给我们购布证，就等于把足够的布匹放在我们手里，可以不用担心奸商投机捣乱。”“有了粮食、食油计划供应，又有棉布计划供应，生活就更安定了！”上海、天津、河北、山东等地广大工人、农民保证要用节约原棉，多织好布和增产棉花等实际行动，支持这项措施的贯彻执行。北京、西安、山东、河南等地许多机关干部、工人、农民等开始酝酿和传播节约棉布、棉花的办法。
    目前，各地生产的棉布，除少部分完全用手纺纱织成的棉布外，都已由国营花纱布公司统购。全国花纱布公司早已开始积极调拨布匹，按照计划供应，货源有充分保证。为了更好地供应消费者的需要，青岛、沈阳等许多地区的国营花纱布公司、合作社等加强了调拨货物、调查群众消费需要等工作。
    对于私营棉布商业，各地人民政府根据政策积极进行全行业的安置。在实行棉布统购统销以前，绝大部分私营棉布批发商就已由各地人民政府进行了慎重的处理和适当的安置。现在私营棉布零售商一般都按照规定进行了登记库存等项工作，大批私营棉布零售商已和国营花纱布公司建立了经销、代销等关系，各地市场棉布供销业务已经基本上纳入国家计划轨道。私营棉布零售商为国家经销、代销以后，店员工人工作积极性大为提高，不少资本家也表示要积极经营。各地私营棉布商按照国家规定的零售价格出售布匹，价格不合理的现象已经基本上得到克服。广州市私商棉布零售价格一般下降百分之三到百分之七。南京等地不少为国家经销布匹的私营棉布零售商，经过改善服务态度和经营管理，已开始取得消费者的信任，营业中出现了新气象。各地棉布复制工业一般都进行了登记库存、编制计划等工作，开始由国营花纱布公司按其正常需要量，有计划地供应用布。
