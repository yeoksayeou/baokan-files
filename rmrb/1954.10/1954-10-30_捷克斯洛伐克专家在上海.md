Czechoslovak Experts in Shanghai

By Our Correspondent Zhang Chao

“Every effort should be made to meet the demands of the Chinese people made to our country,” instructed Klement Gottwald, the former President of the Czechoslovak Republic, to his comrades.

The Czechoslovak experts in Shanghai are faithfully carrying out the behest of Comrade Gottwald.

On September 26th this year, a news item appeared in the Shanghai newspapers: the first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in New China was officially born at the state-owned Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant at 6:40 pm on the 25th. This generator will be combined with the steam turbine being manufactured at the Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant, the boiler being manufactured at the Shanghai Boiler Plant, and the control equipment being manufactured at the Shanghai Huatong Switchgear Plant, to form a complete set of thermal power equipment. This set of equipment will be installed in a thermal power plant designed by our own country at the Huainan Electric Power Bureau.

This set of thermal power equipment is precisely what eight Czechoslovak experts, in accordance with the behest of Comrade Gottwald, and to fulfill the Sino-Czechoslovak technical cooperation agreement, personally guided our workers to manufacture.

Prior to this, these factories left over from the old China, with their rudimentary equipment, found it very difficult to even manufacture thermal power equipment below 600 kilowatts. Now, in just over a year, we are not only manufacturing a complete set of 6,000-kilowatt thermal power equipment, but also, we will soon be trial-producing a complete set of 12,000-kilowatt thermal power equipment.

The work of the experts is divided into two aspects: compiling the designs for the expansion and construction of several factories collaborating in the manufacture of complete sets of thermal power equipment, and guiding the trial manufacture of new products. We had absolutely no experience in these two areas in the past. Although the experts brought complete authoritative blueprints and experience, it was still an extremely complex and arduous task to apply these blueprints and experience to the specific environment in China and transform them into Chinese reality.

The 6,000-kilowatt generator has more than 63,000 parts, and the main component, the "rotor," alone weighs five tons, requiring a high degree of precision. Comrade Husta, who was responsible for guiding the trial manufacture of this product, understood the difficulties of our country and firmly grasped the three principles of good, fast, and economical in the trial production process. In order to achieve "good," he also absorbed Soviet experience when guiding the trial manufacture of certain important parts, and adopted both Czechoslovak and Soviet standards when measuring certain parts. He said: "Soviet experience is advanced and should be learned simultaneously." In order to achieve "economical," after arriving in Shanghai, he repeatedly studied China's specific conditions and paid attention to saving resources in every aspect. For example, the bakelite used on the "stator" was scarce and expensive in China. He discovered that China had abundant and cheap mica, so he advocated using mica to replace bakelite, with the same good quality. Comrade Husta was not only concerned about the 6,000-kilowatt generator, but also about the manufacturing of other various generators, transformers, and so on. Sometimes, he would take the opportunity to run into the warehouse to instruct the staff on how to store materials and criticize the phenomenon of not cherishing state property. His work was meticulous. When workers were pasting insulating paper on silicon steel sheets—a complex and delicate operation—he went down to the workshop and personally demonstrated the operation. Once, a worker did not know the dimensional accuracy of the overspeed fan bushing and came directly to consult him. He immediately drew a diagram on the ground to provide an answer. Usually, the factory would not allow experts to solve minor problems in order to take care of the expert’s energy and time. However, the experts understood our difficulties even better and were unwilling to accept these due restrictions, sometimes even taking the initiative to solve problems outside their scope of responsibility. Comrade Hartl, who guided the Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant in trial-manufacturing the steam turbine, encountered a design problem for a steam turbine test workshop that was both unrelated to him and unfamiliar. At the time, other experts were unable to solve it. When Hartl returned to his country for vacation, he did not forget this matter. During his vacation, he actively researched and collected data from the Lenin Factory and various relevant experts. When he came back, he brought a complete sketch, which solved the difficulty of the workshop's design.

The reporter also visited the technical personnel and staff of the aforementioned three factories under the guidance of the expert group. They could not only cite many such touching stories, but they also had a common conclusion: the experts are the most practical socialist activists.

	“The experts don’t engage in empty talk about politics, nor do they have the time to engage in empty talk about politics,” said a comrade from the "Expert Office" of the Shanghai Boiler Plant to the reporter, "but from the more than one hundred suggestions successively put forward by Comrades Schulz and Mikuschowski, you can see at a glance that they have a socialist principle as a starting point: improve quality, reduce costs, save raw materials, and cherish state property."

In any factory, if a situation arose that could have been avoided that violated this principle, such as not complying with technical operating procedures, resulting in defective products or rework, the experts would criticize it without hesitation. Comrade Kratochvíl had a good explanation for this, saying: "This is to ensure quality, ensure safety, and ensure economic results."

The Czechoslovak experts do not underestimate the strength of our technical personnel, especially the working class. Comrade Kratochvíl summarized the experts' opinions, saying: In many cases, they saw that Chinese technical personnel had a strong desire for knowledge and actively studied foreign materials and scientific works. He also mentioned a common impression among the experts: "The skills of the Chinese working class are admirable, especially in the case of products where the equipment and transportation conditions are not good, many of the products have reached the required accuracy. Once, after our vacation, we went to the Shanghai Boiler Plant and saw that the grate pieces had been made, and that they were made so accurately, we were simply stunned!"

Comrade Husta especially praised the creativity and spirit of overcoming difficulties of the workers in the trial production of the 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator.

He was referring to the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant workers "passing four hurdles." These were the most critical "hurdles" in the trial production of the 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator. The first "hurdle" was the thermal fitting of the retaining ring for the rotor's end winding. The workers explored the heating operation in the high-temperature workshop in summer, and only succeeded on the third try; the second "hurdle" was drilling holes in the retaining ring, which was hard steel, taking thirty minutes to drill one hole. One fitter broke three drill bits in a row. Another fitter, Ge Zhicheng, repeatedly studied the problem and found that the drill bit angle was too large. After correcting it, he himself could drill one hole in five minutes. This "hurdle" was also broken through; the third "hurdle" was precision machining of the rotor. The rotor had to be machined continuously for sixteen hours to complete, and a high degree of precision had to be guaranteed. Turner Fu Shankang also overcame this "hurdle"; finally, the factory director, technical personnel, Party branch secretary, and workers united closely and broke through the fourth "hurdle," completing the complex preparation work for dynamic balancing and overspeed testing.

These were all completed under the guidance of experts and according to the required precision standards.

The experts' conclusion was: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class will be able to catch up with the level of any advanced country in the near future."

However, the experts were not proud of their own contributions; "What we can be proud of is," Comrade Kratochvíl said with a smile, "that we have been able to contribute our small efforts to China's socialist construction."

The people of the Czechoslovak Republic are constantly concerned about and encouraging the work of the expert group and our country's industrial construction. When Comrades Hartl and Husta returned to their country for vacation, several factories in our country entrusted them to bring letters from the trade unions reporting on the work situation and gifts to the Lenin Factory. The workers of the Lenin Factory cherished these things very much. They opened an exhibition in the factory, and later took it to Pilsen Avenue, where the Lenin Factory was located, for exhibition. They also sent the experts' report on the work situation to the National Radio Station for broadcasting. When the experts returned to China after their vacation, they brought back a reply letter from the trade union of the Lenin Factory and return gifts.

The friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples, especially the internationalist assistance of the Czechoslovak people to us, has been given a vivid illustration through this cooperation.

### 捷克斯洛伐克专家在上海

    捷克斯洛伐克专家在上海
    本报记者　张　潮
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国前任总统哥特瓦尔德曾嘱咐他的同志：“应当尽一切力量，满足中国人民向我国提出的要求。”
    在上海的捷克斯洛伐克专家们，忠诚地执行着哥特瓦尔德同志的遗嘱。
    今年九月二十六日，上海报纸上登载了一则新闻：新中国第一台六千瓩汽轮发电机，二十五日下午六点四十分，在国营上海电机厂正式诞生了。这部发电机将和正在上海汽轮机厂制造的汽轮机、在上海锅炉厂制造的锅炉、在上海华通开关厂制造的控制设备，组成全套火力发电设备。这一套设备将安装在淮南电业局的一个我国自己设计的火力发电厂里。
    这套火力发电设备，正是捷克斯洛伐克的八位专家，按照哥特瓦尔德同志的遗嘱，为履行中捷技术合作协定，亲自指导我国工人制造的。
    在此以前，这些旧中国遗留下来的设备简陋的工厂，即使制造六百瓩以下的火力发电设备，也是很勉强的。现在，仅仅一年多时间，我们不仅已在制造六千瓩的全套火力发电设备，而且，不久还要试制一万二千瓩的全套火力发电设备。
        ×　×　×
    专家们的工作分为两个方面：编制扩建和新建协作制造全套火力发电设备的几个工厂的设计和指导新产品试制工作。这两方面的经验，我们过去完全没有，专家虽然带来了权威性的全套图纸和全套经验，但是要把这套图纸和经验运用于中国的具体环境中，变为中国的实际，还是一件极端复杂艰巨的工作。
    六千瓩发电机有六万三千多个零件，主要部件
  “转子”就有五吨重，精密度要求很高，负责指导这项产品试制的是许嘉斯特尼同志。他了解我们国家的困难，在试制过程中，紧紧掌握了好、快、省三条原则。为了做到好，他在指导试制某些重要部件时还吸收了苏联的经验，在测量某些部件时同时采用捷克斯洛伐克跟苏联的标准。他说：“苏联的经验是先进的，应当同时学习。”为了做到省，他到上海后，就反复研究了中国的具体条件，处处注意节约。例如“定子”上用的胶木，在中国又少又贵，他发现中国云母又多又便宜，就提倡用云母来代替胶木，质量一样好。许嘉斯特尼同志所关心的不光是六千瓩发电机，他也关心其他各种发电机、变压器等制造工作，有时他趁空跑进仓库去，指点职工怎样保管材料，批评不爱护国家财产的现象。他的工作是无微不至的，工人在矽钢片上贴绝缘纸——这是一项复杂精细的操作——的时候，他下到车间里，亲自动手作操作示范。有一次一个工人不知道超速风扇用轴瓦的尺寸准确度，直接来请教他，他立即在地上画起图来给予解答。通常，厂方为了照顾专家的精力和时间，是不让专家解决细小问题的。但专家们更理解我们的困难，不愿受这些应有的限制，有时甚至主动解决他们责任范围以外的问题。指导上海汽轮机厂试制汽轮机的哈特尔同志，曾经遇到一个同他无关而又不熟悉的汽轮机试车间的设计问题，当时其他专家也无法解决。哈特尔回国去休假的时候，并没有忘掉这件事情，在休假期中，他积极地向列宁工厂和各方有关专家研究并搜集资料，回来时带了一张完整的草图，解决了这个车间设计的困难。
    记者也访问过受专家小组指导的前述三个工厂的技术人员和职员，他们不仅可以举出许许多多这类动人的故事，而且，他们还有一个共同的结论：专家们是最实际的社会主义行动家。
      “专家不空谈政治，也没有功夫空谈政治，”上海锅炉厂“专家办公室”的一位同志对记者说，“可是你从舒尔茨同志和密许可夫斯基同志先后提出的一百多条建议中，可以一眼看出他有一条社会主义的原则作出发点：提高质量、降低成本、节约原料、爱护国家财产。”
    不论在哪一个工厂里，如果发生了可以避免的违反这个原则的情况，比方说，不遵守技术操作规程，出了废品或者返工，专家们会毫不客气地提出批评的。关于这一点，克拉托赫维尔同志有很好的解释，他说：“这是为了保证质量、保证安全、保证经济效果。”
          ×　×　×
    捷克斯洛伐克的专家们丝毫也不低估我国技术人员尤其是工人阶级的力量。克拉托赫维尔同志综合了专家们的意见说：在很多的情况下，他们看到中国的技术人员有强烈的求知欲，积极钻研国外资料及科学著作。他又提到专家们的一个共同印象：“中国工人阶级的本领值得钦佩，尤其是在设备和交通条件不好的情况下，许多种产品已达到了要求的精确度。有一次我们休假后到上海锅炉厂去，看到炉排片已经制成，而且制得那末精确，我们简直看呆了！”
    许嘉斯特尼同志特别赞扬了六千瓩汽轮发电机试制中工人的创造性和克服困难的精神。
    他指的是上海电机厂工人“过四关”。这是试制六千瓩汽轮发电机过程中最紧要的“关”口。第一“关”是转子紧圈热套护环，工人们在夏季高温车间里摸索着加热操作，直到第三次才试验成功；第二“关”是护环钻孔，这是硬质钢，三十分钟才能钻一孔，一个钳工一连坏了三个钻头，另一个钳工戈智诚反复研究，发现钻头角度太大，修正后，他自己五分钟就能钻一孔，这一“关”也被突破了；第三“关”是精车转子，转子必须连续工作十六小时才能车完，并须保证很高的精确度，车工傅善康也战胜了这一“关”；最后，厂长、技术人员、党支部书记和工人紧密团结，突破了第四“关”，完成了动平衡及超速试验的复杂的准备工作。
    这些，都是在专家的指导下按照应有的精确标准完成的。
    专家们的结论是：“在毛主席领导下，中国的工人阶级能在不久的将来赶上任何先进国家的水平。”
    但是，专家们对于他们自己的劳绩，并不引为骄傲；“可以引为骄傲的是——”克拉托赫维尔同志微笑着说：“我们能在中国的社会主义建设中尽了自己的微小的力量。”
          ×　×　×
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国的人民，时刻关怀、鼓励着专家小组的工作和我国的工业建设。哈特尔同志和许嘉斯特尼同志回国休假时，我国几个工厂曾托他们带去工会写的报告工作情况的信和礼物给列宁工厂。列宁工厂的职工们十分珍视这些东西，他们在厂里开了一个展览会，以后又拿到列宁工厂所在的丕尔森大街上去展览，他们还把专家报告工作情况的录音送到国家广播电台去广播，专家们销假来中国时，又带来了列宁工厂工会的回信和回赠的礼物。
    中捷两国人民的友谊，特别是捷克斯洛伐克人民对我们的国际主义的援助，通过这次合作，又得到了一个生动的说明。
