The languages and scripts of ethnic minorities in Qinghai Province are being widely used. Minority languages and scripts have gradually become the primary tools for autonomous organs in various ethnic autonomous regions to exercise their functions and implement administrative orders. In recent years, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government has translated more than 230 important policies, laws, and various official documents and reports into minority languages, totaling approximately 1.3 million words. The exchange of various official documents between the people's governments of various autonomous regions and their subordinate counties is now largely conducted in the ethnic scripts commonly used within the autonomous regions. Some leading cadres from ethnic minorities are already directly using their own ethnic scripts to approve official documents and handle issues.

At various meetings with the participation of ethnic minority representatives, meeting reports and documents are translated into Tibetan. Some important reports are translated by translation cadres. During the First Session of the First Qinghai Provincial People's Congress held this year, "translation devices" for six languages, including Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian, Tu, Salar, and Kazakh, were installed in the meeting hall, allowing representatives of all ethnic groups to hear reports and speeches in their own languages. In the autonomous organs of various ethnic autonomous regions, the vast majority are equipped with full-time oral and written translation cadres.

The Qinghai Provincial People's Government also attaches importance to the translation and publication work of ethnic minority scripts. In 1952, it began publishing "Qinghai Political News" in both Chinese and Tibetan, and compiled documents such as "Compilation of Work on Promoting Ethnic Regional Autonomy in Qinghai Province" and "Compilation of Important Policies and Laws in Pastoral Areas." Since its inception, "Qinghai Tibetan Newspaper" has published 174 issues, with a circulation of more than 2,920 copies per issue. This year alone, the Provincial Department of Culture and Education has compiled and translated 24 volumes of ethnic language textbooks for primary and senior primary schools, and distributed more than 94,700 copies. The Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Provincial People's Publishing House compiled and published picture magazines and books such as "Collection of Photos of People Across the Country Warmly Endorsing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," "The Story of Mao Zedong's Childhood," and "Internationalist Fighter Luo Shengjiao."

    青海省少数民族的语言文字得到广泛使用
    青海省少数民族人民的语言文字得到广泛使用。少数民族的语文已逐渐成为各民族自治区自治机关行使职权和推行政令的主要工具。几年来，青海省人民政府用少数民族文字翻译的各项重要政策法令和各种公文报告等有二百三十多件，约一百三十多万字。各自治区人民政府和所属各县各种公文的往来，已大部采用自治区境内通用的民族文字。有的少数民族负责干部已直接用本民族文字批答公文和处理问题。
    在有少数民族代表参加的各种会议上，会议的报告文件都译成藏文。有些重要的报告都由翻译干部进行翻译。在今年召开青海省第一届人民代表大会第一次会议时，会场中安装了汉语、藏语、蒙语、土语、撒拉语和哈萨克语等六种语言的“译语风”，使各民族代表都能听到用本民族语言所作的报告和发言。在各民族自治区的自治机关内，绝大部分都配备专职的口头翻译和文字翻译干部。
    青海省人民政府并重视少数民族的文字翻译和出版工作。在一九五二年就出刊汉文和藏文合印的“青海政讯”，编译了“青海省推行民族区域自治工作汇编”、“牧业区重要政策法令汇编”等文件。“青海藏文报”自创刊以来，已出刊一百七十四期，每期发行二千九百二十多份。省人民政府文教厅仅在今年就编译了初小、高小民族语文课本等二十四册，发行了九万四千七百多册。省文联和省人民出版社编译和出版了“全国人民热烈拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案照片汇集”、“毛泽东少年时代的故事”、“国际主义战士罗盛教”等画刊和书籍。　　　　　（新华社）
