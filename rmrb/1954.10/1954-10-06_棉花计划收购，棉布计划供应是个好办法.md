    Planned Purchase of Cotton and Planned Supply of Cotton Cloth is a Good Method

    When the Government Administration Council issued the order on implementing the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and the unified purchase of cotton, I was in Beijing. At that time, I discussed this issue with Qu Yaoli and Guo Yu'en, and everyone thought this method was good.
    Before liberation, families with less land in my hometown generally did not dare to grow cotton because it was difficult to sell. When the Japanese devils occupied the area, the price of cotton was so low that one hundred catties of lint could only be exchanged for two or three dou of grain. From that time on, not many people in our Yicheng County were willing to grow cotton. Not only was the price of cotton low at that time, but private merchants also used heavy scales to cheat you. Even if it was one hundred catties of cotton, they would say it was eighty catties, or ninety catties. After liberation, the People's Government vigorously helped us develop cotton production. If we didn't have cotton seeds, the government helped transport them from other places. If we didn't have enough funds, the government provided loans... Therefore, in 1952, the cotton fields of our Xiliang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative averaged 472 catties of seed cotton per mu. In recent years, the purchase price of cotton has increased, and one hundred catties of cotton can be exchanged for eight or nine hundred catties of grain. The scales of the supply and marketing cooperatives are also fair, which has greatly encouraged our enthusiasm for growing cotton. In the past two years, our local supply and marketing cooperatives sometimes stopped purchasing due to insufficient capacity, which caused complaints among the masses. Now that the unified purchase of cotton is implemented, stipulating that all cotton, except for the agricultural tax and the necessary amount for self-use, must be sold to the state, cotton farmers do not have to worry about not being able to sell the cotton they produce and can boldly increase cotton production according to the state plan. With the implementation of unified cotton purchase, cotton merchants will no longer be able to speculate and disrupt the market, exploiting cotton farmers. Therefore, the planned purchase of cotton is a good method.
    Speaking of the planned supply of cotton cloth, considering the situation of our agricultural production cooperative, the rate of increase in cotton production in recent years has not been slow. In 1952, we created a new record for the highest cotton production in the country. However, compared with the rate of increase in clothing consumption, it is still lagging behind. In the past, farmers still wore clothes patched with different colors on market days and festivals. Now, every family has padded, unlined, and cotton clothes, very complete, with each person having two or three sets of clothes. Many families have also added colorful quilts. In the past, there was also a bad phenomenon where some people, when they had money, would buy several bolts of cloth to store away. These cloths would not be used for two or three years, just sitting there! If planned supply is not implemented, the increase in cloth consumption by the people across the country will be very rapid, and the increase in cotton production will not be able to keep up. In addition, if some people hoard cloth, or even speculate, wouldn't it mean that some people would have a lot of cloth to use, while others would not have any cloth to wear! With the implementation of planned cotton cloth supply, everyone can have clothes to wear, the market will be stable, the country's construction can proceed smoothly, and we will reach a socialist society sooner!
    After I return, I must talk to everyone about these principles, and mobilize everyone to ensure that they sell the surplus cotton to the state in batches according to the state regulations. Now cotton has been harvested in large quantities. After harvesting the cotton, we must do a good job in seed selection, deep plowing early, and applying fertilizer early, to strive for more cotton production next year.

### 棉花计划收购，棉布计划供应是个好办法

    棉花计划收购，棉布计划供应是个好办法
    全国人民代表大会代表
    一九五二年“爱国丰产金星奖章”获得者  吴春安
    政务院关于实行棉布统购统销和棉花统购的命令公布的时候，我正在北京。当时，我和曲耀离、郭玉恩都谈了这个问题，大家都认为这个办法好。
    解放前，我们家乡一般土地少的人家就不敢种棉花，因为种了不好卖。日本鬼子占领的时候，棉价低到一百斤皮棉换二、三斗粮食。从那时候起，我们翼城县就没有多少人愿意种棉花了。那时不但棉价低，私商还用大秤压你，明明一百斤棉花，他说八十斤就是八十斤，说九十斤就是九十斤。解放以后，人民政府大力帮助我们发展棉花生产，我们没有棉籽，政府帮助从外地运来，资金不够，政府就给贷款……，因此在一九五二年，我们西梁村农业生产合作社的棉田，平均每亩收到了四百七十二斤籽棉。这几年棉花收购价格提高了，一百斤棉花能换到八、九百斤粮食；供销合作社的秤也公道，大大鼓舞了我们种棉的情绪。过去两年，我们那里的供销合作社有时候因为收购不及，发生停秤不收的现象，群众有意见。现在实行棉花统购，规定除缴纳农业税和留下必要的自用棉外，全部卖给国家，这样，棉农们就不必担心生产出来的棉花卖不掉，就可以按照国家计划，大胆地增产棉花了。实行了棉花统购，棉花商人也就不能再来投机捣乱，剥削棉农了。所以说，棉花计划收购是个好办法。
    说到棉布计划供应，拿我们农业生产合作社的情况看，这几年棉花产量提高的速度不算慢，一九五二年我们创造了全国棉花最高产量的新纪录，可是和大伙穿衣用布增加的速度比起来，还是落后了。过去逢集、逢会，农民们穿的衣服还是补得花一块、绿一块的。现在那家不都是夹的、单的、棉的，置得很齐全，每个人总有三身、两身衣服。好多人家都添了花花被子。过去还有个不好的现象，有的人有了钱，一下子买几匹布存起来。这些布，两三年都穿用不了，白白搁在那里！要是不实行计划供应，全国人民穿用的布增加的很快，棉花产量的增加赶不上，再加上有人多存布，甚至囤积、投机，岂不是有人用布很多，有人穿不上布了吗！实行了棉布计划供应，人人都能穿上衣服，市场稳定，国家建设能顺利进行，咱们到社会主义社会就快了！
    我回去以后，一定要和大伙谈谈这些道理，动员大伙保证按照国家的规定一批一批地把有余的棉花都卖给国家。现在棉花已经大量采摘了。收了棉花以后，我们要作好选种工作，及早深耕，及早下粪，争取明年增产更多的棉花。
