    State-owned Electric Power Industry Exceeds Third Quarter Production Targets
    On the basis of exceeding the production tasks in the first half of the year, the national state-owned electric power industry has again exceeded the production tasks in the third quarter. The power generation completed 103.35 percent of the target, an increase of more than 20 percent compared with the same period last year; other economic and technical norms were also completed well, and the plant electricity consumption rate, line loss rate, and standard coal consumption rate were all lower than planned. If the plant electricity saved by the national state-owned electric power industry in the third quarter were used for steelmaking, it could produce more than 8,000 tons, and if used for spinning, it could spin at least more than 30,000 pieces. The standard coal saved in the third quarter was more than 15,000 tons.
    With the continuous development of national industry, the task of electricity sales is becoming increasingly heavy. In order to meet the peak load of the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 1955, and to ensure safe power generation and supply, the Electric Power Administration Bureau held a meeting of bureau directors in September, requiring all units to do a good job in various preparations, and severely criticized the complacency of some units.
    In the third quarter, a number of newly installed large generators in the Southwest, Northeast and other regions were put into production, and some are about to be put into production, which can increase the national power equipment capacity by nearly 10 percent. In September alone, three new machines were installed and completed in the Northeast, and the installation quality was very good, generally in line with the advanced Soviet technical standards. For example, the Fuxin new machine, which was inaugurated on September 11, took seven days for the boiler of this new unit to go from ignition to baking and operation, and everything was normal, creating a new record of successful trial operation. This provides an extremely strong guarantee for safe power generation and supply during future peak loads.

    国营电业超额完成第三季度生产任务
    全国国营电业在超额完成上半年生产任务的基础上，又超额完成了第三季生产任务。计发电量完成百分之一○三·三五，与去年同期比较增加了百分之二十以上；其他各项经济技术定额也完成得不错，厂用电率、线路损失率与标准煤耗率都比计划降低了。如果以全国国营电业在第三季节约下来的厂用电去炼钢，约可炼出八千多吨，如果用来纺纱至少可纺出三万多件。第三季节约的标准煤有一万五千多吨。
    在国家工业不断发展的情况下，售电任务日渐繁重。为了迎接今年第四季和一九五五年第一季的高峰负荷，保证安全发电和供电，电业管理总局在九月间召开了管理局长会议，要求各单位必须做好各项准备工作，对有些单位的麻痹自满情绪，进行严厉的批评。
    第三季在西南、东北等区有不少新安装完成的大型发电机投入生产，有些即将投入生产，可使全国发电设备能力增加相近百分之十。仅九月份在东北就有三台新机安装完成，而且安装质量很好，一般都合乎苏联的先进技术标准。如九月十一日业已剪彩的阜新新机，这个新机组的锅炉，从点火到烘炉运转经过七天，一切都很正常，创造了一次试运转成功的新纪录。这对今后高峰负荷安全发电和供电提出了极其有力的保证。
