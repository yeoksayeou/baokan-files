    Intensify Preparations for Winter Construction of Key Projects
    For a long time, China's construction industry has had the habit of suspending work in winter. During the period of national economic recovery, the scale of construction was relatively small, the construction industry was more fragmented, and the technical equipment was still backward, so there was no urgent need for winter construction. However, at present, the scale of China's economic construction is expanding day by day, and the technical equipment of the construction industry is improving day by day. Compared with the needs of national construction, the phenomenon of winter shutdown has become a completely disproportionate habit. Changing the seasonality of the construction industry and striving for year-round operation of the construction industry is not only necessary but also possible.
    Why is it necessary to organize winter construction? This is because it can win more time for capital construction and ensure the high-speed development of China's socialist industrialization. China has a vast territory, and vast areas north of the Yangtze River have freezing periods of varying lengths, especially in the northeast, north China, and northwest regions, where winters are long and the effective construction period throughout the year is short. These regions account for a large proportion of the capital construction investment allocated in the country's first five-year plan and are key construction areas in the first five-year plan. If we continue to be bound by natural conditions in these areas and stop construction projects in winter, the construction speed of China's socialist industrialization will inevitably be directly restricted. Conversely, if winter construction is organized, the effective construction period in these areas will increase by about 25 to 70 percent. This is of great significance for accelerating the construction speed of China's socialist industrialization.
    Judging from the implementation of this year's capital construction plan, organizing winter construction is also urgently needed. In the first half of this year, the eleven central ministries only completed 35 percent of the annual capital construction plan, and the situation has not generally improved by the third quarter. Taking the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry as an example, the ministry should have completed 59 percent of the third quarter plan in July and August, but it actually only completed 43.6 percent. In particular, two-thirds of the construction enterprises that contract key projects failed to complete the July and August plans. Now, winter is approaching, and if winter construction is not organized, this year's capital construction plan may not be completed.
    Organizing winter construction can also overcome the extremely unbalanced phenomenon of construction tasks in each season and reduce the various chaos and waste of manpower, material resources, and financial resources in capital construction management. Over the years, due to the inability to advance the design year and, more importantly, due to the suspension of work in winter, the phenomenon of being idle in one or four seasons and busy in two or three seasons has become a common phenomenon in capital construction. This unbalanced phenomenon is reflected in the use of labor, that is, the total number of employees used in each season rises and falls sharply. The total number of employees used by the ten central ministries in the second and third quarters increased by nearly one time compared with the first and fourth quarters. Under this circumstance, on the one hand, the strength of fixed workers has not been fully utilized, and the state has to spend thousands of billions of yuan each year on winter slack maintenance fees for fixed workers; on the other hand, more temporary workers have to be recruited in the second and third quarters. Not only does the state have to spend a sum of temporary workers' winter dismissal fees and spring recruitment fees each year, but also because temporary workers lack regular ideological education and technical training, the difficulties in management and the chaos in labor organization have increased. In particular, special types of work are even more insufficient due to the concentration of projects in one period. The unbalanced phenomenon of construction is reflected in the use of building materials, that is, the extreme disparity in the use of materials in each season, which has added many difficulties to the material supply work. For example, the central building engineering department's cement application volume in the first quarter of this year accounted for 9 percent of the annual application volume, 73 percent in the second quarter, 17 percent in the third quarter, and 1 percent in the fourth quarter. This situation has brought great difficulties to the material supply work, and sometimes it cannot even fully guarantee the needs of the plan. The unbalanced use of materials also affects the inability to rationally arrange the material entry time and inventory quantity, so that the railway department cannot rationally organize transportation. The unbalanced phenomenon of construction is reflected in the use of subsidiary enterprises and construction machinery, which causes subsidiary enterprises and mechanized supply stations to rush and idle work year after year, greatly reducing equipment utilization. The processing plants of many construction enterprises cannot meet the needs even if they work overtime in the second and third quarters, and they almost stop production in the first and fourth quarters. Many processing plants have no production tasks for four or five months. Finally, the unbalanced phenomenon of construction is reflected in the non-production expenses and the construction of temporary projects, which increases the expenditure of non-production expenses and the scale of temporary projects. Dormitories, canteens, bathhouses, clubs, cooperatives, offices, warehouses, and processing plants have to be expanded accordingly according to the needs of the highest construction volume throughout the year, causing great waste.
    Do we have the conditions to organize winter construction? Yes. Because the construction and installation enterprises contracting industrial construction projects are all state-owned construction industries. They have the superiority of the socialist economy, possess the latest technical equipment, and the construction workers have a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. Moreover, in the past two years, with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, many units have focused on experimenting with various winter construction methods in areas with different temperatures. Generally, the project quality and project progress have been guaranteed, and they have initially mastered the methods of winter construction, trained a group of cadres, and accumulated certain organizational management experience. We should seriously summarize these good experiences and promote them.
    However, we must not think that there are no difficulties in organizing winter construction. Generally speaking, winter construction is still a new topic after all. We have not accumulated a completely systematic experience, and the accumulated experience has not been mastered by all units. Therefore, we must adopt a positive and cautious attitude to carry out the work of winter construction. To this end, the construction and installation enterprises that contract key projects must immediately start to carry out the following preparations for construction:
    First, cooperate with the construction unit to formulate a winter construction plan and determine the winter construction projects. Time is very tight at present, and indecision and hesitation will inevitably delay major events. When formulating the winter construction plan, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the key projects in the construction plan, but it must also be realistic, carefully consider whether the construction technology is guaranteed, repeatedly balance the design, equipment, and technical strength, and earnestly calculate the economic benefits. We must not only oppose the blind and rash thinking that underestimates the difficulties of winter construction and disregards whether subjective strength and various construction conditions are available, but also oppose the passive and conservative thinking that follows old habits, resists winter construction, and shouts difficulties without actively creating conditions.
    Second, make a construction organization design for winter construction, compile a project construction budget for winter construction, and formulate necessary operating procedures to ensure the progress of winter construction, control the cost of winter construction, and especially ensure the quality of winter construction. This is an important part of the preparation work for winter construction. The content of the construction organization design for winter construction should include the project progress, construction procedures, construction methods, technical supply, and site layout that are suitable for the characteristics of winter, especially the insulation work, which is the key to winter construction, and must have appropriate measures. The temporary facilities for the working and living conditions of construction personnel in winter construction must also be properly arranged. Various operating procedures should be reviewed and revised to adapt to the characteristics of winter construction and strictly abide by the principles of cold protection and insulation, labor protection, fire protection, and security.
    Third, prepare the equipment, materials, and technical strength for winter construction. Various heating equipment and insulation materials should be prepared according to the needs of the project, following the principles of reducing costs and ensuring safety; construction machinery and transportation vehicles should be inspected, and the insulation work of the driver's cab and the fuselage should be done well. In terms of technical strength, first of all, according to the possibility, adopt methods such as running short-term training courses for winter construction, holding winter construction experience summary and exchange meetings, and organizing visits, internships, or visits to train a group of engineering and technical personnel who can guide construction, and conduct technical education on winter construction for workers through them; secondly, team leaders and workers should be organized into groups according to the type of work on the construction site to conduct training on the principle of learning while doing.
    Fourth, after actively and fully preparing, we must also carefully check at any time, constantly summarize experience and lessons, and specifically solve the problems that occur at any time, so as to systematically accumulate experience and ensure the smooth progress of winter construction.
    Winter construction is a huge technological innovation in the construction industry. Construction workers! Carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, learn the methods of winter construction, overcome the severe cold, and strive for the victory of winter construction! Comrades in the design department, material supply department, and transportation department! Improve your work to adapt to the needs of winter construction! Engineering and technical personnel and scientific researchers, combine theory with practice and solve scientific problems such as the analysis and testing of insulation materials for winter construction! Party organizations, Communist Youth League organizations, and trade union organizations in construction enterprises should strengthen the political and organizational work in winter construction to ensure the smooth progress of winter construction!
    Striving for effective winter construction this year can not only better complete this year's capital construction plan, but also create more favorable conditions for completing the capital construction tasks of 1955—the decisive year of the first five-year plan. We are not slaves of nature; we want to be the masters of nature. All employees in the construction industry! Strive to gradually make the construction industry operate year-round in the next few years, and accelerate the speed of national socialist industrialization!

    加紧重点工程冬季施工的准备工作
    我国的建筑工业长久以来都有着冬季停工的习惯。在国家经济恢复时期，建设规模较小，建筑工业比较零散，技术装备还落后，对冬季施工还不感到迫切需要。但在目前，我国经济建设的规模日益扩大，建筑工业的技术装备日益改善，冬季停工的现象和国家建设的需要相比，就成了完全不相称的习惯了。改变建筑工业的季节性，争取建筑工业的全年作业，就不仅是必要的而且也是可能的了。
    组织冬季施工为什么是必要的呢？这是因为它可以争取更多时间从事基本建设，保证我国社会主义工业化的高速度发展。我国幅员辽阔，长江以北的广大地区都有长短不同的冻结期，特别是东北、华北、西北等地区冬季漫长，全年有效施工期很短。而这些地区在国家第一个五年计划的基本建设投资分配中，都占有很大的比重，是第一个五年计划中重点建设地区。如果在这些地区，我们继续被自然条件所束缚而在冬季停止建筑工程，就必然使我国社会主义工业化的建设速度受到直接的限制。反之，如果组织冬季施工，这些地区的有效施工期就将增加百分之二十五至七十左右。这对加速我国社会主义工业化的建设速度，是有着重大意义的。
    从今年基本建设计划的执行情况来看，组织冬季施工也是迫不容缓的。今年上半年中央十一个部只完成全年基本建设计划的百分之三十五，到第三季度，情况也没有普遍好转。以中央重工业部为例，该部七、八两月应完成第三季度计划的百分之五十九，但实际上仅完成百分之四十三点六，特别是承包重点工程的建筑企业，有三分之二没有完成七、八两月的计划。现在，冬天眼看就要来了，如果不组织冬季施工，今年的基本建设计划就可能完不成了。
    组织冬季施工，还可以克服各季施工任务极不均衡的现象，减少基本建设施工管理中的种种混乱和人力、物力、财力的浪费。历年来，由于设计年度不能提前，更由于冬季停工，一季四季闲，二季三季忙，已成为基本建设的普遍现象。这种不均衡的现象，反映在劳动力的使用上，就是各季使用职工总数遽升遽降。中央十个部二、三季度使用职工总数较一、四季度增加几近一倍。在这种情况下，一方面，固定工人的力量没有得到充分发挥，国家每年还要支出数千亿元的固定工人冬闲维持费；另一方面，每到二、三季度，又不得不招募更多的临时工人，不但国家每年得支出一笔临时工人的冬季遣散费、春季招募费，而且由于临时工人缺乏经常的思想教育和技术训练，增加了管理上的困难和劳动组织的混乱。特别是特殊工种，由于工程集中在一个时期内，更形不足。施工不均衡现象，反映在建筑材料的使用上，就是各季材料使用的绝大悬殊，给材料供应工作增加了很多困难。如中央建筑工程部今年第一季度水泥申请量占全年申请量百分之九，第二季度占百分之七十三，第三季度占百分之十七，第四季度占百分之一。这种情况，给材料供应工作带来很大的困难，有时甚至不能完全保证计划的需要。而材料使用的不均衡，还影响到不能合理的安排材料进厂时间和库存数量，使铁道部门不能合理的组织运输。施工不均衡现象，反映在附属企业和施工机械的使用上，就造成附属企业和机械化供应站一年一度的赶工和窝工，大大降低了设备利用率。许多建筑企业的加工厂二、三两季加班加点还不能满足需要，一、四两季几乎停止生产，很多加工厂四、五个月没有生产任务。最后，施工不均衡现象，反映在非生产开支和暂设工程的建设方面，是非生产开支的支出和暂设工程的规模增大。宿舍、食堂、澡堂、俱乐部、合作社、办公室、仓库、加工厂都不得不按全年最高施工量的需要而相应地扩大，造成很大的浪费。
    我们有没有组织冬季施工的条件呢？有的。因为承包工业建设工程的建筑安装企业都是国营建筑工业。它们具有社会主义经济的优越性，拥有最新的技术装备，建筑工人们有着高度的积极性和创造性。而且近两年来，在苏联专家的热诚帮助下，不少单位曾在不同气温的地区，重点实验了各种冬季施工方法，一般都保证了工程质量和工程进度，也初步掌握了冬季施工的方法，培养了一批干部，积累了一定的组织管理经验。我们应该认真总结这些好的经验，加以推广。
    但是决不能认为组织冬季施工就没有什么困难了。总的说来，冬季施工毕竟还是一个新的课题，我们还没有积累起完全系统的经验，已经积累的经验也还没有被所有的单位掌握。因此，我们必须采取积极谨慎的态度来开展冬季施工的工作。为此，各个承包重点工程的建筑安装企业，必须立即着手进行下列各种施工的准备工作：
    第一，协同建设单位制订冬季施工的计划，确定冬季施工的工程项目。目前时间已很紧迫，举棋不定，犹豫不决，必将贻误大事。在制订冬季施工计划时，必须保证完成建设计划中的关键性工程，但也必须实事求是，认真考虑施工技术有无把握，反复进行设计、设备和技术力量的平衡，切实计算经济效果。既要反对低估冬季施工的困难，不顾主观力量和各种施工条件是否具备的盲目冒进思想，也要反对因循旧习，抵抗冬季施工，空喊困难而不积极主动创造条件的消极保守思想。
    第二，作好冬季施工的施工组织设计，编好冬季施工的工程施工预算，制订必要的操作规程，以保证冬季施工的进度，控制冬季施工的费用，特别是保证冬季施工的质量。这是冬季施工准备工作的重要环节。冬季施工的施工组织设计的内容，应包括适宜于冬季特点的工程进度，施工程序，施工方法，技术供应，场地布置等部分，特别是保温工作，是冬季施工的关键所在，必须有恰当的措施，建筑人员冬季施工的工作条件和生活条件的临时设施，也必须有妥贴的安排。各种操作规程都应加以审查修改，使之适应冬季施工的特点，严格遵守防寒保温，劳动保护，消防保安的原则。
    第三，作好冬季施工的设备、材料和技术力量的准备。各种加热设备和保温材料应该根据工程的需要，遵循降低成本和保障安全的原则进行准备；施工机械和运输车辆应该加以检查，作好司机室和机身的保温工作。在技术力量方面，首先应根据可能，采用开办冬季施工短期训练班，召开冬季施工经验总结交流会议，组织参观、实习或访问等方式，培养一批能指导施工的工程技术人员，并通过他们对工人进行冬季施工的技术教育；其次，对工长和工人应当在建筑现场按工种分别组织小组，以边做边学的原则进行训练。
    第四，在积极地充分地进行准备之后，还必须随时认真检查，随时总结经验教训，随时具体解决发生的问题，以便有系统地积累经验，并保证冬季施工的顺利进行。
    冬季施工是建筑工业中巨大的技术革新。建筑工人们！发扬革命英雄主义精神，学会冬季施工的方法，战胜严寒，争取冬季施工的胜利！设计部门、材料供应部门、交通运输部门的同志们！改善自己的工作，使之适应冬季施工的需要！工程技术人员和科学研究工作者，把理论联系实际，为冬季施工解决保温材料的分析和试验等科学课题！建筑企业中的党组织、青年团组织和工会组织，加强冬季施工中的政治工作组织工作，保证冬季施工的顺利进展！
    争取今年冬季施工得到成效，不但可以更好地完成今年的基本建设计划，而且更为完成一九五五年——第一个五年计划有决定性的一年——的基本建设任务，创造更有利的条件。我们不是自然的奴隶；我们要做自然的主人。全体建筑工业员工们！为保证在今后几年内逐步使建筑工业做到全年作业，为加速国家社会主义工业化的速度而奋斗！
