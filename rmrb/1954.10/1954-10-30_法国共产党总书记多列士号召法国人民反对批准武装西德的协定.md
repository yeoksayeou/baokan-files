(Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 29th) TASS reported from Paris on October 28th: French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez published an article in "l'Humanité" calling on the French people to intensify their struggle against the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements to arm West Germany.

Thorez said: The struggle against these agreements has entered a crucial new phase. The struggle to prevent the National Assembly from ratifying the aforementioned agreements is of utmost importance for the security of France and the peace of Europe.

Thorez said: The Communists, who voted alone against these agreements fifteen days ago, will exert every effort to unite all forces in the French people to oppose the revival of German militarism. They must work tirelessly until the alliance of national forces defeats the Paris Agreements, just as this alliance defeated the "European Defense Community."

Thorez pointed out that those advocating the revival of German militarism are engaged in new conspiracies, emphasizing that the task of the French Communist Party, in solidarity with all peace fighters, is to strive for new progress. He said: The lessons of the struggle against the "European Defense Community" and for the ceasefire in Vietnam will not be in vain. Links have been established between the French Communist Party and all peace fighters that the war planners failed to destroy during their activities in London and Paris. At a time when threatening German armed forces could be established in a matter of weeks, all far-sighted French people must mobilize their forces.

Thorez then pointed out the impact of the London and Paris Agreements on the lives of the French people. He said: The intensified arms race would prevent France from reducing military spending, from meeting the legitimate demands of factory workers and office staff, and from overcoming the difficulties of small businessmen and artisans. The arms race would neglect the housing problem, the need to equip agriculture, and the needs of public health and education. All working people and ordinary people are being asked to make new "sacrifices."

Thorez emphasized: All well-meaning French men and women see through the government's propaganda that the militarization of West Germany is inevitable. They know that there are opportunities to resolve the German issue through consultations between the countries concerned. They are demanding a positive response to the Soviet Union's note of October 23rd.

On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Franco-Soviet Treaty, all French patriots remember the lessons of the past and are convinced that it is absolutely necessary to stop the rearmament of Hitler's generals and to accept the Soviet Union's proposals for a peaceful resolution of the German issue and the establishment of European security. Therefore, the French Communist Party is not alone in this struggle against the betrayal of national interests and peace. The establishment of an alliance of national forces depends on our efforts.

Thorez pointed out: The main guarantee for establishing such an alliance is the growing movement to strive for united action by the working class. In the Paris region and the provinces, socialist workers and communist workers are increasingly uniting against the London and Paris Agreements. Joint meetings are now being held everywhere, and united action committees are being established. The National Union of Teachers has passed a resolution against the arming of West Germany, and workers participating in the "Workers' Strength" union and workers participating in the General Confederation of Labor have also issued joint appeals. The divisions within the Socialist Party over the issue of participating in the government, to some extent, reflect the attitude of socialist workers towards the government's policies. French socialist workers cannot ignore the hostile attitude of the West German Social Democratic Party towards the Paris Agreements and the opinions of the West German workers, who believe that the revival of German militarism is a fatal danger.

Thorez concluded by saying: If every one of our organizations, every one of our activists, seizes the time and makes persistent efforts to build a united front of the working class and an alliance of national democratic forces, the cause of peace will have every chance of winning once again.

### 法国共产党总书记多列士号召法国人民反对批准武装西德的协定

    法国共产党总书记多列士
    号召法国人民反对批准武装西德的协定
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士在“人道报”上发表文章，号召法国人民加紧斗争，反对批准武装西德的伦敦协定和巴黎协定。
    多列士说：反对这些协议的斗争进入了一个极为重要的新阶段。这个目的在于使国民议会不批准上述协定的斗争，其结果对法国的安全和欧洲的和平是极为重要的。
    多列士说：十五天前单独投票反对这些协定的共产党人，将竭尽一切力量团结在法国人民中起作用的一切力量来反对德国军国主义的复活。他们一定要毫不松懈地努力，直到民族力量的联盟战胜巴黎协定，就像这种联盟战胜“欧洲防务集团”那样。
    多列士指出主张复活德国军国主义的人正在进行新的阴谋活动，强调和一切和平战士团结一致的法国共产党的任务是努力取得新的进展。他说：反对“欧洲防务集团”和争取实现越南停火的斗争的教训是不会白白放过的。法国共产党和一切和平战士之间已经建立了战争策划者在伦敦和巴黎活动期间所未能摧毁的联系。在具有威胁性的德国武装部队可能只要几个星期的时间就会建立起来的时候，一切有远见的法国人都要把他们的力量动员起来。
    多列士接着指出伦敦协定和巴黎协定对法国人民生活的影响。他说：加紧进行的扩军运动会使得法国不能减少军费，不能使工厂工人和机关工作人员的正当要求得到满足，不能使小商人和手工业者的困难得到克服。扩军运动会使房屋问题、装备农业的必要性以及公共卫生事业和教育事业的需要受到忽视。全体劳动人民和普通人民都被要求作新的“牺牲”。
    多列士着重指出：一切善良的法国男女都看穿了政府说什么西德军国主义化是不可避免的这种宣传。他们知道有通过有关国家之间的协商来解决德国问题的机会。他们正在要求对苏联十月二十三日的照会给予肯定的答复。
    值此法苏条约缔结十周年纪念日的前夕，所有的法国爱国者都记取了过去的教训，深信制止武装希特勒的将军们以及接受苏联提出的和平解决德国问题和奠定欧洲安全的建议是绝对必要的。因此法国共产党在这次反对出卖国家利益和和平的斗争中也不是孤独的。建立一个民族力量的联盟有赖于我们的努力。
    多列士指出：建立这种联盟的主要保证就是争取工人阶级一致行动的日益高涨的运动。在巴黎地区和各省里，社会党工人和共产党工人正愈来愈频繁地联合起来反对伦敦和巴黎协定。现在到处都在举行联席会议，成立一致行动委员会。全国教师工会通过了反对武装西德的决议，参加
  “工人力量”工会的工人和参加法国总工会的工人也发表了联合呼吁。社会党内部在参加政府问题上发生的分歧，在一定程度上反映了社会党工人对政府政策的态度。法国社会党工人们不能不考虑西德社会民主党对巴黎协定的敌对态度以及西德工人们的意见，西德工人们认为德国军国主义的复活是一种致命的危险。
    多列士最后说：如果我们每一个组织，我们每一个活动分子都抓紧时间，坚持不懈地努力来建立工人阶级的联合战线和民族民主力量的联盟，和平事业就完全有可能再一次获得胜利。
