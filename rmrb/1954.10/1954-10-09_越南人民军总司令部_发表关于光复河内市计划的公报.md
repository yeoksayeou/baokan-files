(1) According to the agreement reached at the Central Joint Ceasefire Committee meeting, the Vietnam People's Army will enter Hanoi according to the following plan and schedule:

	(A) On October 8, 1954, the Vietnam People's Army will enter the vicinity of Hanoi via various highways; at 4:30 PM on the same day, the Vietnam People's Army will arrive at the Lo Thanh dyke extending from Vinh Tuy village and Bach Mai village to the suburbs of Nga Tu So, Giay Bridge, and Nhat Tan village.

	(B) On October 9th, the Vietnam People's Army will enter Hanoi via various highways and will recover any areas evacuated by the French Union forces. The recovery work will begin at 6:00 AM from the Lo Thanh dyke; at 4:30 PM, the French Union forces will withdraw to the east of Long Bien Bridge, and the Vietnam People's Army will control the entire city of Hanoi.

	(C) On October 10th, the French Union forces will withdraw from Gia Lam Airport and the Gia Lam area to the town of Binh An Nhan, 30 kilometers from Hanoi. The Vietnam People's Army will recover this entire area.

(2) In the areas to be recovered, and during the recovery process, residents should maintain order. Advance teams of security personnel will cooperate with the army to maintain law and order within the city, and they will need the assistance of the residents.

(3) On October 10th, the majority of the Vietnam People's Army troops will continue to enter the liberated capital. The details and timing of this action will be announced by the Hanoi People's Administrative Committee later.

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, October 6th: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, October 5th: The first batch of personnel from the advance delegation led by Tran Danh Tuyen, consisting of 248 administrative and security cadres and staff members of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, entered Hanoi on October 2nd. The second batch of 240 personnel is scheduled to enter Hanoi on October 5th, along with 158 security and law enforcement personnel.

On October 3rd and 4th, the head of the first batch of the advance delegation held meetings with Pissone, the representative of the French Union forces, to discuss preparations for the handover. Vietnamese and French representatives also held a meeting on October 3rd to introduce their respective cadres.

Hanoi residents were very excited upon learning of the arrival of the advance delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The first batch of advance personnel visited several public utilities on October 4th. It was apparent from this initial visit that a large amount of public property had been removed, and the staff of many public utilities had been reduced to almost zero. Some public utilities had been closed long ago, and the furniture, documents, and materials therein had all been removed or destroyed.

Petitions signed by thousands of people from all walks of life in Hanoi and the suburbs of Hanoi have been submitted to the Vietnam Central Joint Ceasefire Committee and the International Supervisory and Control Commission, demanding that the French Union authorities protect the remaining public property, return the property that has been moved, and compensate for the property that has been destroyed.

Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam: On October 6th, the French Union forces withdrew from Ha Dong city, the capital of Ha Dong province, and the Vietnam People's Army immediately entered this jubilant city.

Ha Dong city is an important outer city southwest of Hanoi, only eleven kilometers from the center of Hanoi, and connected by tram. According to the ceasefire agreement between Vietnam and France, French troops had to withdraw from this city on October 6th and concentrate in the direction of the suburbs of Hanoi.

Early in the morning of the 6th, a unit of the Vietnam People's Army, neatly attired, advanced towards Ha Dong city along Highway 6 and Highway 22. Behind them were cadres from the Military and Administrative Committee of Ha Dong city of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Ha Dong City Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and mass organizations, wearing red armbands with gold stars and riding bicycles. Further behind were trucks and carts carrying grain and firewood to supply the needs of the people.

Beginning at 7:30 AM, the French troops gradually retreated from the outposts southwest of Ha Dong city, and finally completely withdrew across the Nhue Giang Bridge to the Chao Phuc village, two kilometers northeast of the city. The vanguard of the Vietnam People's Army, holding high the golden star red flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, followed closely behind the retreating French troops and advanced towards the city. Representatives of the Vietnamese International Supervisory and Control Commission were present at the handover area. The handover was successfully completed at 10:00 AM.

Inside the city, as the Vietnam People's Army arrived, the doors and windows of shops and residences were opened, and in an instant, golden star red flags and slogans of various colors filled the entire city. In front of Chinese shops, the national flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China were hung high, and Chinese slogans were posted, cheering the victory of the Vietnamese people and the longevity of Sino-Vietnamese friendship. On the two-kilometer-long "Guang Trung Street," crowds of people in festive costumes moved about everywhere. Many people gathered to read the entry proclamation of the Ha Dong City Military and Administrative Committee, the eight policies of the Democratic Republic government regarding newly liberated cities, and the ten disciplines for personnel entering the city. In less than an hour, the market's business quickly returned to normal, and many people were buying and selling cattle in the market next to the Nhue Giang Bridge. Some privately-owned silk weaving factories in the "small industrial area" resumed operation as usual.

At 12:00 noon, the Ha Dong City Military and Administrative Committee held a flag-raising ceremony. Zhu Van Du, Chairman of the City Military and Administrative Committee, announced the ten disciplines once again to all personnel and troops entering the city to participate in the takeover work, and then a golden star red flag was raised high in the center of the city. Cadres and subsequent troops marched into the original military and administrative organs according to the original plan to carry out takeover and guard duties. The order throughout the city was very stable, and the water supply station continued to supply the people of the city with water as usual.

    发表关于光复河内市计划的公报
    【新华社八日讯】越南通讯社北越讯：越南人民军总司令部八日发表关于光复河内市计划的公报，全文如下：
    （一）根据中央联合停战委员会会议达成的协议，越南人民军将依照以下的计划和时间表进入河内：
    （甲）在一九五四年十月八日，越南人民军将由各条公路进入河内附近；在当天下午四时半，越南人民军将抵达从永绥村、白梅村一直伸展到峨斯所、纸桥近郊和日新村的罗城堤堰。
    （乙）在十月九日，越南人民军将由各条公路进入河内，并将收复法兰西联邦部队撤退的任何地方。收复工作将于上午六时从罗城堤堰开始；在下午四时半，法兰西联邦部队将撤到龙编桥以东，越南人民军将控制河内整个城市。
      （丙）十月十日，法兰西联邦部队将由嘉林机场和嘉林地区撤到距河内三十公里的贫安仁县城。越南人民军将收复这整个地区。
      （二）在将要收复的地区里，以及在收复的过程中，居民应当遵守秩序。治安人员先遣小组将与军队合作来维持城内的治安，他们将需要居民的协助。
      （三）十月十日，越南人民军的大部分部队将继续进入已获得解放的首都。这一行动的细节和时间将由河内人民行政委员会以后予以公布。
     【新华社六日讯】据越南通讯社北越五日讯：以陈名宣为首的由越南民主共和国政府的行政和治安干部以及工作人员二百四十八人所组成的先遣代表团第一批人员，已在十月二日进入河内。第二批人员二百四十人定于十月五日和一百五十八名保安和治安人员一起进入河内。
    十月三日和四日，先遣代表团第一批人员负责人曾和法兰西联邦部队代表皮逊举行会议，讨论了关于移交的准备工作。越、法双方并在十月三日举行了介绍双方干部的会议。
    河内居民在得知越南民主共和国政府的先遣代表团到达的消息以后，都非常兴奋。
    第一批先遣人员在十月四日参观了若干处公用事业。从这第一次参观中看出，大批公共财产已被移走，许多公用事业的人员已减少得几乎等于零。有几处公用事业老早就关门了，其中的家具、文件和物资已全部被移走或已被毁坏。
    由河内和河内市郊各阶层人民数千人签名的请愿书已经送交越南中央联合停战委员会和国际监督和监察委员会，要求法兰西联邦当局保护存留下来的公共财产，并送回那些被搬走的财产和赔偿那些被破坏的财产。
    据新华社北越讯：法兰西联邦部队十月六日撤出河东省省会河东市，越南人民军随即进入这个欢腾的城市。
    河东市是河内西南的重要外围城市，距河内市中心只十一公里，有电车互相连接。停战后按照越法双方协议的规定，法国军队必须在十月六日撤出这个城市，向河内市郊方向集结。
    六日清晨，军容整齐的越南人民军某部沿着第六号公路和第二十二号公路，向河东市前进。后面是越南民主共和国政府河东市军政委员会、越南劳动党河东市委员会和群众团体的干部们，他们戴着红底金星的臂章骑着自行车前进。再后面是一辆辆汽车和大车，载着准备供应人民需要的粮食和木柴。
    自上午七时半开始，法国军队由河东市西南的前哨据点逐步收缩，最后经过锐江大桥完全撤离到市区东北二公里的潮福村。越南人民军的先头部队高举着越南民主共和国金星红旗，紧接着撤退的法国军队后面向市内进发。在交接地段，有越南国际监督和监察委员会的代表在场。交接在上午十时顺利结束。
    在市区内，越南人民军到达哪里，哪里的商号和住户的门窗就打开来了，一刹那间金星红旗和各色标语布满了全市。在华侨商号的门前，高挂着越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国两国国旗，张贴着欢呼越南人民胜利和中越友谊万岁的中文标语。长达二公里的“光忠大街”上，到处走动着穿着节日服装的人群。很多人围着看河东市军政委员会入城布告、民主共和国政府关于新解放城市的八项政策和入城人员的十大纪律。不到一小时，市场的营业很快就恢复了常态，锐江大桥旁边的市场里许多人在买卖耕牛，“小工业区”里的一些私营手工业织绸厂照常开工。
    十二时，河东市军政委员会举行升旗仪式。市军政委员会主席朱文杜向全体入城参加接管工作的人员和部队再度宣布十大纪律后，一面金星红旗就在全市的中心高高地升起。干部和后续部队按照原订计划分别开进原军政机关，进行接管和警卫。全市秩序十分安定，自来水站照常供应全市人民用水。
