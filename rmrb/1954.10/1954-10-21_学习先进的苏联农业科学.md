Learning Advanced Soviet Agricultural Science
Chen Fengtong, Director of the North China Agricultural Science Institute

The Soviet Union's Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition has brought us tremendous friendship and inspiration. Chairman Mao Zedong has repeatedly called on us to learn from the Soviet Union, and the various achievements displayed in the Soviet Union's Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition greatly facilitate our learning from the Soviet Union.

Under the correct leadership of the CPSU Central Committee and the efforts of all Soviet working people, Soviet agricultural production is constantly improving. Taking winter wheat as an example, the average yield per hectare in the Tsarist era was only a few quintals. After the October Revolution, it increased to more than ten quintals. In 1953, it was more than twenty quintals, and the highest yield in large areas reached fifty to seventy quintals. A new variety of wheat created by Soviet scientists is expected to yield 100 quintals per hectare on a large scale.

The increase in Soviet agricultural production is inseparable from the tremendous development of Soviet agricultural science. Soviet agricultural science work has developed under the guidance of Michurin biological science according to Marxist-Leninist theory. Its main feature is that scientific workers combine theory with practice, production, and the wisdom of the broad masses of workers and peasants to jointly research and create. This encourages millions of farmers to be creative in production technology reform and active in production, thereby quickly enriching the content of science. We saw at the exhibition many contributions of collective farm peasants to agricultural science, such as the new tillage method created by Maltsev of the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm, which has great significance for the improvement of scientific work.

Soviet agricultural science is a comprehensive science that develops forward. It not only develops forward with the high collectivization and high mechanization of agricultural production, but also the research within the agricultural science departments is closely related to each other. For example, the design of grass-arable rotation is the result of comprehensive research on soil, fertilizer, pests and diseases, crops, and pasture. If we do not study the amount of soil organic matter and the degree of soil fertility, and mechanically implement perennial pasture rotation, it will cause doctrinaire errors and affect the planting area of crops. We have seen many such comprehensive research results at the Soviet exhibition, which are all worth learning from.

Soviet agricultural scientists constantly and promptly provide new scientific and technological achievements to the production sector, ensuring the continuous rise of agricultural and animal husbandry production. We saw at the exhibition that Soviet scientists applied Michurin's hybridization theory to create many new varieties in grains, animal husbandry, fruit trees, and vegetables, improving the quality and yield of winter wheat, cotton, and fruit trees, and expanding the cultivation range. In addition, Soviet scientists advocated infiltration irrigation, spray irrigation, foliar fertilization, the manufacture of granular fertilizers and mixed fertilizers, extensively studied soil microbiology, and applied bacterial fertilizers, which all played a great role in improving agricultural production. Due to the development of Soviet science and the great achievements of industrial construction, Soviet agriculture not only utilizes wind power, water power, and electric power, but also further utilizes atomic energy, solar heat, etc. to engage in production. In 1953, Soviet electricity consumption in agriculture increased to 4.5 times that of 1940. The opening of every reservoir and canal in the Soviet Union will generate a large amount of electricity and a large area of new irrigation areas. Soviet agricultural scientists are carrying out large-scale research on agricultural electrification, studying the use of electricity to drive tractors and combine harvesters, use electricity to dry grains and cultivate vegetable seedlings, and use electricity to raise livestock, milk cows, and shear sheep. Agricultural mechanization is an important factor in the development of Soviet socialist agriculture. At present, the level of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union has generally reached more than 80%, and the level of mechanization of cultivated land has reached more than 90%. All heavy work in the production process is operated by machines. The number of machine tractor stations has increased from six in 1929 to more than 8,900 in 1953. Each station has a large number of tractors, grain combine harvesters, paddy field tillage machines, cotton harvesters, and various new agricultural machines; airplanes have also been widely used in agricultural production.

Soviet agricultural science work advocates creative research and opposes dogmatism. When Soviet agricultural scientists introduce foreign animal and plant varieties, they are generally used as breeding materials or as parental lines for hybridization, rather than mechanically applying them without testing and research. Such examples can also be seen in the exhibition.

After seeing the achievements of Soviet agricultural science at the exhibition, I realized that we must humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and in light of our country's current actual situation, closely link with the masses and with reality, and realistically improve our country's agricultural science work step by step on the existing level, and gradually improve our country's agricultural production on the existing basis.

Our agricultural scientists should currently attach great importance to the following tasks.

In the past, not only was our country's agricultural science backward, but it was also deeply poisoned by Anglo-American bourgeois ideology. Scientific research institutions had very few domestic survey and research data, and rarely absorbed foreign advanced theories to create new results by combining them with our country's inherent things. Today we should learn from the Soviet Union's method of combining theory with practice. In the current situation of the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives in our country, we must be familiar with the actual situation of rural production, and systematically combine with local scientific work institutions to deeply understand the key problems existing in agricultural production.

We are not just promoting tractors and combine harvesters, but more importantly, we must help and support farmers in improving their plows, promote the three-legged movable plow created by farmers, and promote the knife-blade cotton cultivator used by the Zhoujiazhuang Cooperative in Jin County. We must not look down on these simple tools, because these tools are cheap and any small blacksmith or carpenter can make them. We must vigorously promote double-wheeled double-furrow plows and other animal-powered farm implements.

We should currently conduct large-scale surveys and research on regional green manure crops and study alfalfa in northern China and milk vetch in southern China. We must not just wait for the import of a large amount of red clover and timothy from the Soviet Union. Especially important, we should quickly develop leguminous and gramineous pasture needed for a one-year rotation system. The inherent experience of the masses, such as plowing under green manure, composting crop straw, cutting green grass for composting, applying silt to the land, and using Amur peppervine to grow on wasteland for composting, are all effective methods to increase soil organic matter and improve soil fertility.

Today, we should use ditches, rivers, roadsides, especially beaches and sand ridges, to build shrub forests, such as basket willow and Amur peppervine, which can not only prevent wind, but also be used for composting, and the tender branches and leaves can also be used to feed cattle and sheep. When planting shelterbelts, we should adapt to local conditions, rather than subjectively demarcating the routes of the forest belts in the middle of farmland like planting utility poles. This is divorced from reality and the masses. Of course, we must actively prepare conditions for the construction of regular farmland shelterbelts, and we must not wait for the arrival of afforestation machines before starting work.

The current task of crop breeders is to sort out farmers' varieties and seeds, propose sorting plans, and participate in the sorting work, so as to discover better varieties and seeds for breeding. It is wrong to pay attention only to the new seeds that you can get after ten or eight years of cultivation, without paying attention to the activities of millions of farmers and their urgent needs.

Indeed, in the Soviet Union, hybridizing goosegrass and winter wheat can produce perennial wheat; winter wheat can be sown in Siberia; dozens of fruit tree varieties have been cultivated in Amursk and Chita; tomatoes have been cultivated in the Arctic Circle; lemons have been successfully cultivated in Ukraine... All of this is the result of the creative efforts of Michurin and his successors. There is no doubt that we will also be able to achieve the same results through our efforts. However, we must take the first step on the existing basis of our country's agricultural production, and first improve our country's agricultural production by one step.

We must strive to learn from the brilliant achievements of Soviet biology and agricultural science. From all the exhibits in this exhibition, we have seen the unparalleled superiority of Soviet science, which gives us great encouragement. We must work diligently, we must value our own things. Chinese farmers have extremely high skills in planting fruit trees and vegetables. The Soviet people and scientists attach great importance to this. Ukrainian collective farms are breeding Beijing ducks in large numbers, and Eastern European brother countries are actively studying Chinese sweet potatoes, tussah silkworms, and mulberry silkworms. The original material for the Soviet Union's breeding of new wheat varieties, Buddha's hand wheat, has long been available in northern China. The richness of our country's animal, plant, fruit tree, vegetable, and beneficial bird and insect varieties is rare in the world; many wild animals and plants that are extremely useful to mankind have been domesticated regionally for a long time and grow in their most suitable places. Therefore, our agricultural scientists should conduct thorough investigations and research today. Let us use our strength and our time correctly to make more contributions to the current agricultural cooperation.

    学习先进的苏联农业科学
    华北农业科学研究所所长　陈凤桐
    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会，给我们带来巨大的友谊和鼓舞。毛泽东主席曾一再号召我们向苏联学习，苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中展示的各种成就，就大大便利于我们向苏联学习。
    在苏共中央的正确领导和全体苏维埃劳动人民的努力下，苏联的农业生产在不断提高。以冬小麦为例，沙皇时代平均每公顷只产数公担，十月革命后提高到十多公担，一九五三年二十多公担，大面积最高产量达到五十至七十公担。苏联科学家所创造的一种新的小麦品种，在大面积土地上每公顷可望收获一百公担。
    苏联农业生产的提高，是和苏联农业科学的巨大发展分不开的。而苏联农业科学工作，则是按照马克思列宁主义的理论，在米丘林生物科学指导下发展起来的。它的主要特点是科学工作者结合实际，结合生产，结合广大劳动群众的智慧共同研究，共同创造。这样便鼓舞了千百万农民对生产技术改革的创造性和对生产的积极性，并因此很快的充实和丰富了科学的内容。我们在展览会中看到许多集体农庄农民对农业科学的贡献，其中如“列宁遗志”集体农庄马尔采夫所创造的新耕作法，对科学工作的提高就有重大的意义。
    苏联农业科学，是综合性的向前发展的科学。它不但随着农业生产的高度集体化和高度机械化而向前发展，而且在农业科学本部门内的研究，也是密切地互相关联的。例如草田轮作的设计，是土壤、肥料、病虫害、作物和牧草等综合研究的结果，如果不研究土壤有机质存在的多少、土壤肥沃的程度，而机械地实行多年生牧草轮作，就会造成教条主义的错误，影响作物的播种面积。我们在苏联展览会中看到了许多这种综合性研究的成果，这都是值得我们学习的。
    苏联农业科学工作者，不断地及时地把新的科学技术成就，提供到生产部门中去，保证了农牧业生产的不断高涨。我们在展览会上看到，苏联科学家应用米丘林杂交学说，在谷物、畜牧、果树、蔬菜等方面创造了很多新品种，提高了冬小麦、棉花以及果树的质量、产量，扩大了栽培范围。此外，苏联科学家提倡渗透灌溉法、喷雾灌溉法、根外施肥法，制造颗粒肥料及混合肥料，广泛研究土壤微生物学，应用菌类肥料，这对提高农业生产都有很大作用。由于苏联科学的发展及工业建设的巨大成就，苏联农业中不但利用了风力、水力和电力，并进一步利用原子能、太阳热等来从事生产。一九五三年苏联在农业方面的电力消费量增加到一九四○年的四、五倍，苏联每一个贮水库和运河的开凿，都会产生出大量的电力和大面积的新灌溉区。苏联农业科学家正开展大规模的农业电气化的研究工作，研究用电力推动拖拉机、联合收割机，用电力干燥谷物、培育菜苗，用电力饲养家畜、挤牛奶、剪羊毛。农业机械化是苏联社会主义农业发展的重要因素。现在，苏联农业机械化的水平，一般已达到百分之八十以上，耕地的机械化水平已达到百分之九十以上，生产过程中一切的繁重工作，都用机器来操作。机器拖拉机站已由一九二九年的六个站增加到一九五三年的八千九百多个站，每个站都拥有大量的拖拉机、谷物联合收割机、稻田耕作机、棉花收割机，以及各种新式农业机器；飞机也已大量应用到农业生产方面。
    苏联农业科学工作中提倡创造性的研究，反对教条主义。苏联农业科学工作者在引进外国动植物品种时，一般都是作育种材料用，或作杂交时的父本用。而不是不经试验研究，即机械搬用。这种实例在展览会中也是可以看到的。
    在展览会上看到苏联农业科学的成就以后，我认识到，我们必须虚心学习苏联的先进经验，根据我国目前的实际情况，紧密联系群众、联系实际，实事求是地把我国的农业科学工作在现有水平上逐步提高，把我国的农业生产在现有基础上逐步提高。
    我国农业科学工作者目前应该十分重视以下的几种工作。
    过去，我国不但农业科学落后，而且深深受了英美资产阶级思想的毒害。科学研究机关中很少本国的调查研究资料，也很少吸收外国先进理论，结合本国固有的东西创造出新的成果来。今天我们应该学习苏联结合实际的工作方法。在目前我国农业生产合作化发展的情况下，我们必须熟悉农村生产的实际情况，有计划有系统地结合地方上的科学工作机关，深入农村了解农业生产中存在的关键问题。
    我们不只是要宣传拖拉机、联合收割机，而目前更主要的是帮助和支持农民的改耧工作，推广农民所创造的活动三腿耧，推广晋县周家庄合作社所用的刀片棉花中耕器。我们决不能看不起这些简单的工具，因为这些工具价廉，任何一个小炉匠、一个木匠都可以制造。我们必须大力推广双轮双铧犁及其他畜力农具。
    我们目前应该大规模调查研究区域性的绿肥作物和研究我国北方的苜蓿，南方的紫云英，决不能只等待由苏联输入大量的红三叶和猫尾草。特别重要的，我们应从速研究出一年轮栽制所需要的豆科和禾本科牧草。群众中固有的经验，如压绿肥，作物秸秆沤粪，割青草沤粪，淤泥上地，利用废地种紫穗槐来沤粪，都是增加土壤有机质、提高土壤肥沃性的有效方法。
    我们今天应该利用沟渠、河道、大路两旁，特别是沙滩、沙埂来营造灌木林，如?柳、紫穗槐等，它既可防风，又可沤粪，嫩枝叶还可喂牛羊。在栽植防护林时，应该因地制宜，而不是主观地在农田中间和栽电线杆一样去区划林带路线，这是脱离现实，脱离群众的。当然，我们必须为营造正规的农田防护林积极准备条件，决不能坐待造林机器到来以后才进行工作。
    作物育种家的当前任务是整理农家品种与种子，提出整理方案，并参加整理工作，从中发现较优良的品种和种子进行繁殖。不注意千百万农民的活动和他们的迫切需要，而只注意自己培育十年八年以后才能得到的新种子，这是不对的。
    诚然，在苏联，鹅冠草、冬小麦杂交，可以得出多年生的小麦；西伯利亚可以播种冬小麦；阿母斯克、赤塔都已栽培着数十种的果树品种；北极圈已栽培了西红柿；乌克兰已栽培成功了柠檬……，这
  一切都是米丘林和他的继承者创造努力的结果，我们经过努力也一定可以获得同样的成绩，这是毫无疑问的。但是，我们必须在我国农业生产的现有基础上，先迈开第一步，先把我国的农业生产提高一步。
    我们必须努力学习苏联生物学和农业科学的辉煌成就。从这次展览会全部展览品中，我们看到了苏维埃科学的无比优越性，给我们以极大的鼓舞。我们必须踏踏实实工作，我们必须重视我们自己的东西，我国农民栽植果树、蔬菜都有极高的技术。苏联人民、科学家很重视这一点。乌克兰集体农庄大量繁殖北京鸭、东欧兄弟国家积极研究我国的甘薯、柞蚕和家蚕。苏联培育新麦种的原始材料佛手麦种，我国北方很早就有了。我国动物、植物、果树、蔬菜，以及益鸟益虫品种的丰富，是世界上所稀有的；有许多对人类极有用的野生动植物，经过长期区域性的驯化，生长在它们最适宜的地方。因此，我们农业科学工作者今天应该很好地进行调查、研究。让我们正确地使用我们的力量，使用我们的时间，为当前农业合作化作更多的贡献。
