    Cadres in first-level organs in East China and in Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places have successively begun studying the documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress. Some areas have also begun conveying reports to the masses. Wuhan, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Yunnan Province have also made arrangements for this study.

    Cadres from the advanced theoretical study groups of first-level organs in East China and at the municipal and district levels in Shanghai began studying the documents on October 10. The East China First-Level Organs Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated a plan for dissemination and study in accordance with the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. It has been decided that three weeks will be spent on the study, during which the original study of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" and general knowledge of economic construction can be suspended. Individual units that believe they can study the conference documents well within the specified time without suspending theoretical study can also combine the studies. The study of documents will focus on the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao's opening speech, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, and other documents, combined with listening to explanatory reports and group discussions when necessary.

    More than 70,000 cadres in Chongqing began to study the documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress on October 13. The Propaganda Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has made arrangements in all units throughout the city. It requires cadres at all levels to understand the great role of these documents in my country's socialist construction through this study; to understand the nature of the Constitution and its basic content, to establish a concept of strict compliance with the Constitution and laws, and to concretely implement the spirit of the documents in their work. The study time is estimated to be one and a half to two months. Except for cadres in the advanced theoretical study group who study on their own, those participating in the intermediate and primary theoretical study groups will take the form of listening to reports, group discussions, and answering questions. Propaganda and education for the masses will be carried out in a decentralized manner in conjunction with the current central work.

    The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party actively arranged for cadres to study the documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, and conducted dissemination of the First Session of the First National People's Congress to workers, peasants and other people of all classes. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Government jointly convened a meeting of representatives of the Wuhan Municipal People's Congress and cadres of the advanced theoretical study group of Wuhan on October 12. At the meeting, Wang Renzhong, representative to the National People's Congress and First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made a report. Zeng Dun, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also mobilized at the meeting for the full restoration of the theoretical study of cadres in Wuhan. From October 13, Party committees at all levels throughout the city made study arrangements in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee. The dissemination and reporting to the masses were carried out separately by reporters from the Municipal and District People's Congress representatives organized by Party committees at all levels. During the dissemination, in light of different objects and in connection with the thinking of the masses, it was closely combined with the current increase production and practice economy movement.

    The directly affiliated organs and groups of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will also begin studying the documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress from mid-October. According to the instructions of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on studying the documents of the National People's Congress meeting, the general school of the amateur political school of the Inner Mongolia direct organs, convened a meeting of the heads of the branch schools on October 8 to arrange the study. It was decided that each study unit, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, should carry out in-depth ideological mobilization, overcome complacency, and concentrate its efforts on doing a good job in this study.

    The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a notice on October 12 to arrange for the study of the documents of the First Session of the National People's Congress. In the notice, the Provincial Party Committee required Party committees in various places to combine the leadership of the study and dissemination with the current central work, and to formulate specific plans to ensure that this study can improve the socialist consciousness of cadres and people of all ethnic groups, and become the driving force for completing national plans and promoting various tasks. Cadres at the provincial and Kunming municipal levels began their studies on the 18th. All localities will also carry out the work of disseminating and reporting on the First Session of the National People's Congress to the people of all ethnic groups.
