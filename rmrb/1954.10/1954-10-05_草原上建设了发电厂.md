    Power Plant Built on the Grassland
    By Our Correspondent Lin Mo
    On September 21st, on the Xilin Gol Grassland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, people were quietly waiting for one thing: the trial operation of the newly built Xilinhot Power Plant, the first of its kind on the Inner Mongolian grassland. The completion of the Xilinhot Power Plant has evoked indescribable excitement among the people on the grassland.
    Construction and installation workers from distant southern and northern China, after months of hard work on the northern grassland, were about to complete their great task. The residents of Xilinhot had been waiting for this event for a long time, and it was about to come true. The power plant workers had been busy since dawn, preparing for the trial run. The boiler workers lit the fire, and gradually, thick smoke spewed from the thirty-six-meter-high chimney, floating across the vast grassland. In a tall building, the generator turned smoothly. A burst of applause rang out throughout the plant. Construction worker Wang Guilin looked at the tall chimney and the brand-new factory building. He knew the difficulties of building this power plant on the grassland. All the steel, bricks, tiles, wood, and even every nail had to be transported from thousands of miles away by trucks, ox carts, and camels. Wang Guilin had, for the first time, applied the advanced bricklaying experience he had learned from the Soviet bricklaying expert Nauchijin to the construction of this power plant, saving materials and shortening the construction time for the country. Now, looking at this power plant standing on the grassland, he couldn't help but feel joy in his heart. He kept nodding and muttered, "Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet elder brother and helping the fraternal nationalities on the grassland build a happy life is the glorious task of our working class." The roaring sound of the power plant machinery shook the small town of Xilinhot, and the residents of the whole city cheered! This news will quickly spread throughout the grassland. The 56,000 people of Xilin Gol League will caress it with warm hands and look at it with kind eyes, as if they had received a newborn baby. How can people not feel happy?
    Xilinhot is a newly emerging town in Inner Mongolia after liberation, and the only town on the 200,000-square-kilometer grassland of Xilin Gol League. In the past, this place was called "Beizi Temple," a desolate place with only an ancient temple and dozens of dilapidated mud houses. The site of the current power plant was once a wild grassland where only wolves howled at night. After liberation, it became the seat of the Xilin Gol League People's Government. With the development of production in the whole league, more than a thousand brick and tile houses were gradually built here. A number of small shops formed a commercial market area around the tall brick buildings of the state-owned trading company and supply and marketing cooperative. In addition, there was a two-li-long road. The neat buildings on both sides of the road included the People's Government, banks, post offices, newspapers, primary schools, middle schools, cadre schools, hospitals, handmade felt factories, and a people's club that could accommodate a thousand people. The city was inhabited by more than 7,000 residents of Mongolian, Han, Hui, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups. It became the center of the political, economic, and cultural life of the people of the entire Xilin Gol League. People came to the People's Government to handle affairs, send their children to school, and buy and sell things here. In the past two years, it had supplied the herdsmen on the grassland with about 130 billion yuan worth of grain, cloth, tea, cigarettes, sugar, and other daily necessities, as well as a large number of production tools; and shipped more than 200,000 head of livestock, more than 170,000 cattle and sheep skins, and more than 4 million jin of down and wool to all parts of the country. However, in the past, due to the lack of industry in this place, the state had to transport the herdsmen's livestock products to cities thousands of miles away, process them into various supplies, and then transport them back. Now, with the establishment of the power plant and the availability of electricity, various processing plants for hides, furs, dairy products, meat, timber, leather, rice, and flour will gradually appear in Xilinhot, the center of the people's lives in the whole league, and an automobile repair plant will be built. The factory buildings of a newly built tannery have already appeared on the outskirts of the city.

    草原上建设了发电厂
    本报记者  林沫
    九月二十一日，在内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒草原上，人们在静静地等待着一件事：内蒙草原上第一座新建的锡林浩特发电厂试车运转。锡林浩特发电厂的建成，草原上的人们的兴奋心情是难以形容的。
    来自遥远的祖国的南方和华北的建筑和安装工人，在北方的大草原上，经过几个月的艰苦工作，眼看大功要告成了。锡林浩特全城的居民等待已久的事情，将要实现了。电厂的职工们从天亮就开始忙碌着，进行试车的准备。司炉的工人把火燃着了，渐渐的从那三十六公尺高的烟囱上喷吐出一股股浓烟，飘扬在广阔的草原上。在一座高高的楼房里，发电机顺利地转动了。全厂响起一片掌声。建筑工人王桂林望着那高高的烟囱和崭新的厂房，他知道在草原上建筑这座发电厂的困难，所用的全部钢材、砖瓦木料甚至连每一颗钉子，都要从千里以外，用汽车、牛车和骆驼运来。王桂林曾经把他向苏联瓦工专家那乌契金所学的先进砌砖经验，初次运用到这座电厂的建设中，为国家节省了材料，缩短了建筑时间。他现在望着这座电厂矗立在草原上，止不住内心的喜悦，他不住地点着头，嘴里念念地说：“学习苏联老大哥的先进经验，帮助草原上的兄弟民族建设幸福的生活，这是我们工人阶级光荣的任务。”发电厂轰隆的机器响声震动了锡林浩特这个不大的城镇，全城的居民欢腾了！这消息将迅速传遍在草原上，锡林郭勒盟的五万六千多人民将像得到一个新生的婴儿那样，用温暖的手抚摸它，用亲切的眼光看望它。人们怎么能不感到喜悦呢？
    锡林浩特，这是内蒙古解放后一个新兴的城镇，也是锡林郭勒盟二十多万平方公里草原上唯一的城镇。过去这地方叫“贝子庙”，原是一个荒凉的地方，仅有一所古老的庙宇和几十间破旧的土房。现在的发电厂所在地，那时还是一片野草滩，黑夜只有狼在那里嚎叫。解放后，这里成了锡林郭勒盟人民政府所在地。随着全盟生产的发展，这地方逐渐建筑了一千多间砖瓦房。一些小商店围着国营贸易公司和供销合作社的高大砖房形成了一个商业市场区。另外还有一条两里长的马路。马路两旁的整齐建筑，有人民政府、银行、邮局、报社、小学、中学、干部学校、医院、手工毛毡场以及容纳一千人的人民俱乐部等。全城居住着蒙、汉、回、藏等各族七千多居民。这儿成了全锡林郭勒盟人民政治、经济、文化生活的中心。人们到人民政府来办理事情，送他们的子女来上学，到这里买卖东西。过去两年中，曾从这里供应草原牧民价值约一千三百亿元的粮食、布匹、茶、烟、糖等生活用品和大批生产工具；而从这里向祖国各地输送了二十多万头牲畜、十七万多张牛、羊皮和四百多万斤绒毛。但过去这地方因为缺乏工业，国家必需把牧民的畜产品运到千里外的城市，加工制造出各种用品，再运回去。现在随着发电厂的建立，有了电力供应，在锡林浩特这个全盟人民生活的中心，将逐渐出现皮毛、乳肉、木材、制革、米面等各种加工厂，将建立汽车修配厂。一座新建的制革厂的厂房已出现在城郊的原野上。
