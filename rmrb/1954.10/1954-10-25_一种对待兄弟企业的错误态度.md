Editor's Note: The situation described in the letter from the State-owned Tianjin Paper Mill has been confirmed by our investigation. This fact reflects that a small number of staff members in our state-owned enterprises still treat brother enterprises with a capitalist erroneous attitude, thus violating the principle of mutual assistance and cooperation between state enterprises.

The decision of the Tianjin Paper Mill to transfer its orders to support the Tianjin Chemical Plant is in line with the principle of mutual assistance and cooperation between state enterprises. However, the Tianjin Chemical Plant adopted a completely different attitude and approach to this issue. The Tianjin Chemical Plant's request to return the goods was due to some objective reasons, such as a lack of understanding of the liquid chlorine needs when the agreement was signed and changes in the production plan; however, the main reason was that after the agreement was signed, they discovered that the liquid chlorine from the Tianjin Paper Mill was purchased from the Dagu Chemical Plant at a commodity price, which was higher than the price they could directly allocate. Instead of openly discussing the situation with the Tianjin Paper Mill and adopting a consultative attitude to resolve the issue, they concealed the truth, fabricated reasons, and even used deceptive means to get the boatmen to ship the goods back, attempting to disclaim responsibility. They also suggested that the Tianjin Paper Mill return the goods in the name of overstocking, with the aim of making it easier for them to purchase this batch of liquid chlorine from the Dagu Chemical Plant at the allocation price. Obviously, this behavior of only considering one's own convenience, regardless of the difficulties of others, and only considering one's own interests, regardless of the losses of others, is a reflection of capitalist management thinking, which is incompatible with the relationship between socialist state-owned enterprises. Now, the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee has made a preliminary handling of this incident, and the main person responsible, Du Jinzhang, the head of the Technology Supply Section of the Tianjin Chemical Plant, has reviewed his mistakes. We believe that the issue of correcting the attitude towards brother enterprises should attract widespread attention.

    An Erroneous Attitude Towards Brother Enterprises
    Letter from State-owned Tianjin Paper Mill: In late April this year, Liu Xuke, a planner from the Tianjin Chemical Plant, contacted our factory, saying that the plant urgently needed liquid chlorine for production and could not obtain a supply for the time being, requesting our factory's assistance. In order to support the plant's production, we decided to use the bleaching powder prepared for the third quarter ahead of schedule and transfer 75.8 tons of liquid chlorine ordered for the second quarter to the plant. After obtaining the consent of Du Jinzhang, head of the Technology Supply Section of the plant, Liu Xuke signed an agreement with our plant on April 30 to transfer the liquid chlorine. Among this batch of liquid chlorine, 5.8 tons were not suitable for our factory due to the small bottles, and we originally planned to return them. On the 28th, we entrusted Comrade Liu Xuke to transport them to the Dagu Chemical Plant; 40 tons were shipped out of Tianjin on the 30th; and the remaining 30 tons were stipulated to be paid and picked up in two installments in Dagu in May. At that time, our factory also requested instructions from the higher authorities and made preparations to use bleaching powder instead of liquid chlorine in production scheduling.

    On May 1, Liu Xuke suddenly came to our factory and asked to return 40 tons of liquid chlorine; on the 2nd, the plant sent a telegram asking to return 70 tons of goods; on the 3rd, Liu Xuke and others from the plant came to our factory again, insisting on returning all the goods. Because we had made new arrangements in production scheduling, it was difficult to change again; but in order to take into account the actual difficulties of the plant, we decided to consider taking back part of it. However, after repeated contacts, the plant always insisted on returning all the goods. In the process of consultation, the plant showed a very insincere attitude. For example, regarding the reason for returning the goods, the plant sometimes said it was because of equipment failure, and sometimes said it was because the request to transfer liquid chlorine was due to "false and untimely supply"...there were six different statements, some of which were contradictory. For another example, regarding the signed contract, the plant successively put forward excuses such as "this was done randomly by cadres, and the leadership did not know about it," "Director Du Jinzhang did not consider it carefully when he agreed," and "the agreement and the contract are different in nature," attempting to evade responsibility. What is even more intolerable is that the plant's cadres used the lie that "the Tianjin Paper Mill sent an urgent telegram requesting the liquid chlorine to be shipped back" to deceive the boatmen into shipping more than 45 tons of liquid chlorine back to our factory, attempting to disclaim responsibility. Finally, because the plant insisted on canceling the agreement and asked our factory to return the goods to the Chemical Industry Bureau, without considering our factory's opinions and difficulties, the consultation could not continue.

    This incident has caused economic losses to our factory, and the overstocking of liquid chlorine has affected the production of the Dagu Chemical Plant, which produces liquid chlorine, because empty bottles cannot be returned in time. More seriously, the dishonest practices adopted by the Tianjin Chemical Plant in this incident have also created a very bad political impact. Our factory believes that the Tianjin Chemical Plant should examine and correct this erroneous practice in order to further strengthen the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between state-owned enterprises in the future.

### 一种对待兄弟企业的错误态度

专栏：

    编者按：国营天津造纸总厂来信所述情况，经我们调查是确实的。这件事实反映了我们国营企业中有少数工作人员，还以资本主义的错误态度来对待兄弟企业，以致违反了国家企业之间的互助协作的原则。
    天津造纸总厂决定转让本厂的订货来支援天津化工厂，这种做法是符合国家企业间互助协作原则的。但是，天津化工厂对这个问题却采取了完全不同的态度和做法。天津化工厂要求退货，固然也有一些客观原因，如签订协议时对液氯需要情况并不了解，生产计划也确有变动；但是，更主要的原因是，在协议签订后发现了天津造纸总厂的液氯是按商品价格向大沽化工厂购入的，比他们直接调拨的价格要高。他们对这个问题不是开诚布公地把情况向天津造纸总厂谈清楚，采取协商的态度来解决；却不惜隐瞒真相，假造理由，甚至采用欺骗手段让船户把货运回，企图推出不管。他们还建议天津造纸总厂以积压为名退货，其目的则是便于他们再向大沽化工厂把这批液氯按调拨价购入。显然，这种只顾自己方便、不管别人困难，只顾自己有利、不管别人损失的行为，是资本主义经营思想的反映，它与社会主义性质的国营企业之间的关系是不相容的。现在，天津市财政经济委员会对这个事件已经作了初步的处理，主要责任者天津化工厂技术供应科科长杜锦章已经检讨了自己的错误。我们认为，端正对待兄弟企业的态度问题，应该引起普遍的注意。
    一种对待兄弟企业的错误态度
    国营天津造纸总厂来信：今年四月末，天津化工厂计划员刘绪科和我厂联系，说是该厂生产中急需液氯，一时得不到供应，要求我厂协助解决。我们为了支援该厂的生产，决定把准备在第三季度使用的漂粉提前使用，而将第二季度订货液氯转让该厂七十五点八吨。刘绪科用长途电话征得该厂技术供应科科长杜锦章的同意后，就在四月三十日和我厂订立了转让液氯的协议。这批液氯中有五点八吨因瓶小不适合我厂使用，我厂原拟退换，就在二十八日托刘绪科同志转运大沽化工厂；有四十吨在三十日由天津运出；其余三十吨规定五月份在大沽分两次交款提货。我厂当时也请示上级同意，并在生产调度中作了用漂粉代液氯的准备工作。
    五月一日，刘绪科突然来我厂要求退回液氯四十吨；二日，该厂又来电报要求退货七十吨；三日，该厂刘绪科等又来我厂，坚持要全部退货。我们因为在生产调度中已作了新的布置，再要改变有不少困难；但为了照顾该厂的实际困难，决定考虑收回一部分。但是，经往返联系，该厂始终坚持全部退货。在协商过程中，该厂表现了很不诚恳的态度。如退货的理由，该厂有时说是因为生产设备发生故障，有时说是因为要求转让液氯时是“虚假的供应不及时”……；先后六种不同的说法，有的根本互相矛盾。又如对待已签订的合同，该厂先后提出了“这是干部随便乱搞，领导方面不知道”，“杜锦章科长同意时没有很好考虑”以及“协议和合同性质不同”等借口，企图不负责任。更令人不能容忍的是，该厂干部用“天津造纸总厂来急电要求把液氯运回”的谎话，哄骗船户把四十五吨多液氯运回我厂，企图推出不管。最后，由于该厂坚持取消协议，让我厂向化工局退货，毫不考虑我厂的意见和困难，致协商无法继续进行。
    这个事件，已使我厂经济上受到损失，并且因液氯积压，空瓶不能及时退回而影响了生产液氯的大沽化工厂的生产。更严重的是，天津化工厂在这个事件中采取的不老实的做法，在政治上也造成很不好的影响。我厂认为：天津化工厂应该检查、纠正这种错误的做法，以利今后国营企业间互助协作关系的进一步加强。
