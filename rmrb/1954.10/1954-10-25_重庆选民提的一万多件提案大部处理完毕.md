    The over ten thousand proposals put forward by voters in Chongqing have mostly been handled. These proposals were put forward during the first meetings of the first People's Congresses of various districts, held successively from March to July this year. In the Sixth District, out of 1,444 proposals put forward by voters throughout the district, 1,410 have been handled, accounting for 97% of all proposals. In essence, every proposal has been addressed and every matter has been accounted for.

    The relevant departments have handled the proposals quickly and carefully. After receiving proposals from the masses criticizing and suggesting improvements, the Sixth District Grain Company promptly conducted a review among its cadres and made improvements. After receiving proposals, the Sixth District Department Store conducted a review among all cadres, criticized the erroneous ideology of not paying attention to commercial work, and corrected its service attitude. The Sixth Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent five cadres to solicit specific opinions from the proposers. After the Yunan Highway Maintenance Team followed the proposals and knocked down the rocks about to fall on the hillside near the highway, they invited the proposers to visit. According to the proposals of the voters, the Zhongyi Road Police Station of the First District actively rectified the street nurseries and helped the masses find employment. According to the requirements of the masses in the Mao'er Stone area of the Second District, the state-owned Grain Company quickly established a grain store there and supplied flour, which the masses were very satisfied with.

    重庆选民提的一万多件提案大部处理完毕
    重庆市选民们所提的一万多件提案已大部处理完毕。这些提案是在今年三月到七月间先后召开的各区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上提出来的。第六区全区选民所提一千四百四十四件提案，已处理了一千四百一十件，占全部提案的百分之九十七，基本上做到了案案有着落，件件有交代。
    各有关部门对提案的处理是迅速的、慎重的。第六区粮食公司在接到群众对他们的批评和建议的提案后，及时地在干部中进行了检查，作了改进。第六区的百货商店接到提案后，在全体干部中进行了一次鉴定，批判了不重视商业工作的错误思想，端正了服务态度。市公安局第六分局曾派五个干部下去征求提案人的具体意见。渝南公路养护队根据提案把靠公路半山坡上将要坠落的石头打下后，请提案人前去参观。第一区中一路派出所根据选民的提议，积极整顿了街道托儿所并帮助群众劳动就业。国营粮食公司根据第二区猫儿石地区群众的要求，很快地就在那里设立了粮店，并供应面粉，群众感到非常满意。
