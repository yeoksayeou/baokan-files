Dear Comrades and Friends:

Today, as we depart from the glorious capital of the People's Republic of China, our government delegation extends its deep and heartfelt gratitude to the government of the People's Republic of China and to all the Chinese people. Thank you for the friendly care and warm hospitality extended to us during our stay and visit in China.

The grand celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China has brilliantly demonstrated the power and strength of our great neighbor, the People’s Republic of China, and has proven the unbreakable friendship and unity of the entire peace, democracy, and socialist camp.

During our visit to China, we were exceedingly happy and proud to witness the great victories and achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Government headed by Chairman Mao Zedong.

The brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects of their country's economy and culture are a powerful blow to the enemies of the peace camp.

Comrades, for the joy and happiness of all progressive mankind in the world, and for the consolidation of the forces of the powerful peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, please allow me, on behalf of the Mongolian people and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic, to wish you and all the great Chinese people further and glorious victories and achievements.

Long live the great People's Republic of China!

For the prosperity and happiness of our two peoples, may the friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples be further developed and consolidated!

Long live world peace!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party, the true representative of the interests of the Chinese people!

Long live the government of the People's Republic of China, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, the long-tested leader of the Chinese people!
