    Congratulating the Fourth Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Telegram from Premier Kim Il-sung to Chairman Mao
    To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:

    On the occasion of welcoming the fourth anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I, on behalf of all the Korean people and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as in my own name, extend my deep gratitude and respect to you, respected Chairman, and through you to the fraternal Chinese people.

    The participation of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea ensured the historical victory of the Korean people in their Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism. In the post-war period, the continued material and spiritual assistance given to us by the fraternal Chinese people, and the labor assistance from all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, have made a great contribution to our post-war rehabilitation and construction.

    For the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and for peace in Asia, I am confident that the solid friendship between the peoples of Korea and China will be further strengthened and developed.

    I wish you even greater achievements in the great socialist construction of the People's Republic of China, and wish you good health.

                                      Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Pyongyang, October 24, 1954
