    Rural Party Organizations and Young Intellectuals
    ——The CCP Pingyao County Beichangbao Village Branch Educates Primary School Graduates
    In Beichangbao Village, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, there have always been very few literate people, and none of the village cadres can fluently read the newspaper. This has caused many difficulties in the work. As the village Party branch secretary, Yan Shoulun, said: "Filling out forms and making reports require writing, but we just can't pick up a pen." The mutual aid teams in the village often have problems with keeping clear records of work points and accounts, which affects the consolidation and development of the teams. Therefore, improving the level of education has become an urgent demand of all cadres and masses in the village.
    Last summer, eight primary school graduates from this village returned. None of them had been admitted to middle school. In principle, they should have stayed in the village to participate in work and production, but none of them wanted to stay. One of them, named Zhang Lanying, scraped together 300,000 yuan for travel expenses with the help of her grandmother and went to Taiyuan to look for work. Zhang Lanying lived in Taiyuan for more than a month, spent all her money, and couldn't find a job. She had to return home, where she was scolded by her grandmother. Zhang Lanying herself was even more frustrated, crying bitterly. The other primary school graduates were also wandering around, inquiring about school admissions and factory recruitment. They said, "Let's wait for an opportunity, we won't work in the village no matter what." The village Party branch and Youth League branch discovered these situations and convened meetings of Party members and Youth League members to study how to help these primary school graduates overcome this incorrect thinking. The Party branch secretary proposed to all Party members and Youth League members: educating these young intellectuals is the responsibility of the Party and the League. If we can unite and cultivate these people well, it will greatly help the work in the village. After this meeting, Party members and League members all paid attention to the work of uniting and educating these primary school graduates. After the meeting, the Party branch and Youth League branch held a forum for primary school graduates to discuss the development prospects of agricultural production, and linked it to the future construction tasks and beautiful vision of Beichangbao Village. At the meeting, the Party branch expressed its welcome to primary school graduates to participate in agricultural labor and improve agricultural production. After the forum, their mood was very high. Then, the Party branch and Youth League branch conducted individual talks with them to solve their specific ideological problems. For example, for Zhang Lanying, in addition to continuing to explain the importance of participating in agricultural production, they calculated for her the travel expenses for her two trips to Taiyuan, and told her about the model deeds of middle school and primary school graduates participating in agricultural labor in various places. At the League meeting, everyone also encouraged Zhang Lanying to actively participate in agricultural labor, and helped her examine and criticize her unwillingness to participate in agricultural labor. The Party and the League's patient education and assistance to Zhang Lanying improved her awareness and strengthened her love for the Party and the League. She said, "In the future, I will definitely participate in agricultural labor well and be a good League member." The other primary school graduates, after the patient education of the Party branch and the Youth League branch, gradually improved their awareness, reversed their thinking of despising agricultural labor, and expressed their willingness to stay in the village to participate in production.
    Last October, the village vigorously publicized the Party's general line during the transition period, and the eyes of these primary school graduates became even brighter. At the study and discussion meeting, they further criticized their erroneous thinking of not wanting to participate in agricultural labor. For example, Yan Taisheng self-criticized and said: "My family has never studied for generations. Thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have turned over and went to school, but we don't want to work anymore. This is an ungrateful thought." Other students also said: "After studying the Party's general line, I feel that agricultural labor is even more lovable." Therefore, eight primary school graduates participated in the mutual aid team together. Under their leadership, the number of mutual aid teams in the village quickly developed from four to thirteen.
    However, the backward public opinion of some people in the village also somewhat affected the labor and production mood of the primary school graduates. Zhang Lanying's grandmother nagged almost every day that Lanying was "good for nothing." One day, the old man Xing Wancai ran into the primary school graduate Yan Huanran picking up manure and said, "It's a real shame for a scholar to pick up manure!" Therefore, the Party branch and Youth League branch analyzed and studied the ideological situation of the masses, and mobilized all Party members and League members to patiently carry out persuasive education work to the masses. At the mass meeting, the Party branch and the Youth League branch combined specific cases to publicize the significance of primary school graduates participating in agricultural production to the masses, and visited the students' parents separately to conduct individual persuasive education. On the other hand, after eight primary school graduates participated in agricultural production, they were able to use their practical actions to change many incorrect views among the masses. Zhang Lanying is one example. Although she is a girl, after she joined the mutual aid team, she worked from dawn till dusk every day, accumulating fertilizer at home, and spreading sand, spreading manure, pulling the drill, and weeding in the fields. This year, her family's land was cultivated very carefully, and the crops grew better than in previous years. Zhang Lanying's grandmother was very happy and changed her view of Lanying. She said: "My Lanying is really a good child. In previous years, I had to hire someone to farm the land and also hire someone to deliver meals. This year, not only did I not hire anyone, but the crops grew better than in previous years." Primary school graduate Yan Taisheng used scientific methods to apply top dressing to the cotton fields, making the cotton grow particularly well. After seeing their labor results, the masses reflected: "These children are really both cultured and skilled." The Party branch also promptly publicized their model deeds to the masses. Now, some of the eight primary school graduates have been selected as township secretaries and accountants, some have been selected as village financial and grain committee members, cultural and educational committee members, voluntary teachers of people's schools, and members of the women's federation, and some have even been elected as people's representatives. From then on, the backward public opinion among the masses and the parents' complaints were no longer heard.
    Of course, because they had just come out of school, they faced many difficulties in work and production. The Party branch and Youth League branch paid attention to helping them solve these difficulties, often held forums, introduced them to work experience and production knowledge, and invited old farmers to teach them various agricultural techniques according to different agricultural seasons. In addition, they also adopted the "master-apprentice" method, teaching and practicing at the same time. For example, during the spring plowing and sowing season this year, the Youth League branch selected three mu of valley land for them to learn how to rock the drill. When learning, they first explained the basic movements and precautions of rocking the drill, and then let them experiment. In this way, the students gradually became skilled in production. Among the eight primary school graduates, three have already signed up to join agricultural production cooperatives, and the other five cannot sign up for the cooperative due to family reasons.
    The Party branch and the Youth League branch paid great attention to organizing them to conduct spare-time studies, helping them arrange study time and choose study content, in order to stabilize and consolidate their mood for working and producing in rural areas, and to continue to improve their cultural, technical and political and ideological levels. In addition, the village also used these eight primary school graduates as the backbone to carry out various sports and recreational activities.

    农村党组织和青年知识分子
    ——中共平遥县北常堡村支部教育高小毕业生
    参加农业生产的经过山西省平遥县的北常堡村，识字的人从来就很少，在村干部中也没有一个能够痛痛快快看通报纸的人。这样，工作中的困难就很多。正如该村党支部书记阎守论说的：“填表呀，汇报呀，好多事情都得动笔，但是，就是拿不起笔来。”全村的互助组也常常因为记工算账不清楚，影响到组的巩固和发展。因此，提高文化水平早已成为全村干部和群众的迫切要求。
    去年夏天，这个村的八个高小毕业生回村来了。他们都没有考上中学，按理说，他们应当留在村里参加工作和生产，但是，他们中却没有一个人愿意留在村里的。其中有一个叫张兰英的，就和她的外祖母七难八难地凑起了三十万元的路费，到太原去找工作。张兰英在太原住了一个多月，钱花完了，工作没找着，只好回到家里来，又遭到外祖母的责骂。张兰英自己更是懊恼万分，痛哭流涕。其他的几个高小毕业生也是东游游，西串串，到处打听学校招生和工厂招工的消息。他们说：“等机会吧，说什么也不在村里劳动。”村里的党支部和团支部发现了这些情况，便召开了党员和青年团员会议，研究如何帮助这些高小毕业生克服这种错误思想。党支部书记向全体党员和青年团员提出：教育这些青年知识分子是党和团的责任，如果能把这些人团结好、培养好，对村里的工作就会有很大的帮助。经过这次会议，党员团员都重视了团结和教育这些高小毕业生的工作。会后，党支部和团支部又召开了高小毕业生座谈会，座谈农业生产的发展前途，并联系到北常堡村今后的建设任务和美丽的远景。会上，党支部表示欢迎高小毕业生参加农业劳动，提高农业生产。座谈会后，他们的情绪很高。接着，党支部和团支部又和他们进行了个别谈话，分别解决各人的具体思想问题。比如对张兰英，除了继续向她讲解参加农业生产的重要意义外，又替他计算了两次去太原所花的路费，同时把各地中学和小学毕业生参加农业劳动的模范事迹讲给她听。在团的会议上，大家也鼓励张兰英积极参加农业劳动，并帮助她检查和批判了自己不愿意参加农业劳动的思想。党和团对张兰英耐心的教育和帮助，提高了她的觉悟，增强了她对党和团的热爱。她表示说：“今后我一定要好好地参加农业劳动，作一个好团员。”其他几个高小毕业生，经过党支部和团支部的耐心教育后，觉悟也都逐渐提高，扭转了轻视农业劳动的思想，表示愿意留在村里参加生产。
    去年十月，村里大张旗鼓地宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线，这些高小毕业生的眼睛更亮了。在学习讨论会上，他们进一步批判了自己不愿意参加农业劳动的错误思想。如阎泰盛自我检讨说：“俺家过去祖辈都没有念过书，靠共产党和毛主席的领导，咱们翻了身，上了学，反倒不想劳动了，这是忘本思想。”其他同学也都说：“学习了党的总路线，觉得农业劳动更可爱了。”于是，八个高小毕业生一起参加了互助组。在他们的带动下，全村互助组便很快地由四个发展到十三个。
    但是村中部分群众的落后舆论，也多少影响着高小毕业生的劳动生产情绪。张兰英的外祖母，几乎每天都唠叨兰英“没出息”。邢万才老汉有一天碰见高小毕业生阎焕然在拾粪，就说：“念书人拾了粪，真败兴！”于是，党支部和团支部又把群众的思想情况作了分析研究，并动员全体党员、团员耐心地向群众进行说服教育工作。在群众大会上，党支部和团支部结合具体事例向群众宣传了高小毕业生参加农业生产的意义，又分别访问了学生家长，进行个别说服教育。另一方面，八个高小毕业生参加农业生产后，也都能够以自己的实际行动来转变群众中的许多不正确的看法。张兰英就是一个例子。她虽然是个女孩子，但在她参加互助组以后，每天都是起早搭黑的干活，在家里积肥，在田里铺沙、撒粪、拉耧、锄苗，样样都干。今年，她家的地就种得很细致，庄稼长得比往年好。张兰英的外祖母很高兴，也改变了对兰英的看法。她说：“俺兰英真是个好孩子，往年我雇人种地还得雇人送饭，今年不光没有雇人，庄稼还长的比往年好。”高小毕业生阎泰盛运用科学方法在棉田里施加追肥，使棉花长得特别好。群众看到了他们的劳动成果后都反映：“这些孩子，真是文武双全。”党支部也及时将他们的模范事迹向群众进行了宣传。现在，八个高小毕业生，有的被选为乡里的秘书、会计，有的被选为村里的财粮委员、文教委员、民校义务教员、妇女联合会委员等，有的还当选为人民代表。从此，群众中的落后舆论和学生家长的怨言，再也听不到了。
    当然，他们因为刚从学校出来，在工作和生产中的困难是不少的。党支部和团支部便注意帮助他们解决这方面的困难，经常召开座谈会，给他们介绍工作经验和生产知识，并根据不同的农业季节，邀请老农给他们传授各种农业技术。除此以外，还采用“师傅带徒弟”的办法，一面教一面实习。如在今年春耕播种时期，团支部便选择了三亩谷地，让他们学习摇耧。学习时，首先给他们讲清楚了摇耧的基本动作和应注意的事项，然后让他们进行实验。这样，同学们便在生产上慢慢熟练起来了。八个高小毕业生中，已有三个报名参加农业生产合作社，其他五个因为家庭关系暂时还不能报名入社。
    党支部和团支部很注意组织他们进行业余学习，帮助他们安排学习时间和选择学习内容，以安定和巩固他们在农村工作和生产的情绪，和继续提高他们的文化、技术和政治思想水平。此外，村里还以这八个高小毕业生为骨干，开展了各项体育和文娱活动。
