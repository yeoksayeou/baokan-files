Farmers in Shangdu County and Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, have recently focused on promoting double-wheel double-share plows in six agricultural production cooperatives, which has been warmly welcomed by farmers.

These six agricultural production cooperatives have been experimenting with double-wheel double-share plows for plowing since September 14th. More than 370 township and village cadres, heads of agricultural production cooperatives, heads of mutual aid teams, and advanced farmers have visited the fields of these cooperatives. During the trial use, farmers' impressions of the double-wheel double-share plow were: First, the quality of the plowed land is good: the plowing depth reaches five inches, the bottom of the furrow is flat, no hard stalks are left, the soil is turned over thoroughly, the grass is covered and compacted, and the soil is broken up evenly, which is conducive to crop growth; Second, the livestock pull steadily, without the need to hold it by hand, saving manpower. If the livestock are good, one person can follow two plows, or two people can follow three plows, and it is not difficult for women to follow the plow; Third, the double-wheel double-share plow has high plowing efficiency, saving a lot of labor and animal power: Yuan Weifu Cooperative in Shangdu County used three medium-sized cattle to pull the plow, with one person following, plowing 8.5 mu of land per day, which is 4.5 mu more than the old plow. The labor and animal power saved each year, converted according to local wages, is almost enough to buy a double-wheel double-share plow. The Xinglong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangbei County has even higher plowing efficiency with horses pulling double-wheel double-share plows. Calculated at 40 days of plowing per year, the labor and animal power saved, converted according to local wages, can reach 1.2 million yuan, which is enough to buy a double-wheel double-share plow with a surplus of 250,000 yuan.

After seeing the benefits of using double-wheel double-share plows to plow the land with their own eyes, the farmers dispelled the idea of "trying it out." Many cooperatives and teams want to purchase double-wheel double-share plows in large quantities. After the first day of on-site trials, Su Zhongshi, the head of the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Erdaowa, Shangdu, said, "Now our thinking is completely clear. Our cooperative not only wants this double-share plow, but also needs to add twelve more." After another day of plowing, this cooperative wanted to borrow money to buy 24. Some farmers in Xifangzi Village, Shangdu, described the double-wheel double-share plow as: "Two shares hitting a horse, one hit is worth two." (That is to say, the efficiency of the double-wheel double-share plow is equivalent to two old plows). According to statistics from Shangdu and Zhangbei counties after organizing farmers to visit in four places, each cooperative and team has requested to purchase 105 double-wheel double-share plows.

    河北省商都张北两县农民喜爱双轮双铧犁
    河北省商都县和张北县最近在六个农业生产合作社中，重点推广了双轮双铧犁，受到农民的热烈欢迎。
    这六个农业生产合作社，从九月十四日起，先后试验用双轮双铧犁耕地，各地乡、村干部、农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长和先进农民三百七十多人都到这些社的地里参观。在试用过程中，农民对双轮双铧犁的印象是：一、耕的地质量好：耕深达五寸、沟底平、不留硬梗、翻土彻底、盖草压实、碎土均匀，有利于作物的生长；二、牲畜拉着稳，不用手扶，节省人力，若牲口好使，一个人可跟两部犁，或两个人跟三部犁，妇女跟犁也没有困难；三、双轮双铧犁耕地效率高，节省了很多人工和畜工：商都县袁维福社用三头中常的牛拉犁，一个人跟犁，每天耕地八亩半，比旧犁多耕四亩半，每年节省的人工和畜工，按当地工价折合，差不多可买一部双轮双铧犁。张北县兴隆农业生产合作社用马拉双轮双铧犁耕地的效率更高，每年以耕地四十天计算，节省的人工和畜工，按当地工价折合，可达一百二十万元，买一部双轮双铧犁以外，还余二十五万元。
    农民亲眼看到使用双轮双铧犁耕地的好处以后，把“试试看”的思想打消了，许多社、组都要大批购买双轮双铧犁。商都二道洼的曙光农业生产合作社，经过第一天实地试验以后，社长苏忠轼说：“这一下我们的思想可完全打通了，我社不但要这一部双铧犁，还需要增加十二部”，又耕了一天的地以后，这个合作社就要贷买二十四部了。商都西坊子村有的农民形容双轮双铧犁说：“二股叉打马，一下顶两下。”（就是说双轮双铧犁的效能，可顶两部旧犁）。据商都、张北两县在四个地方组织农民参观后的统计，各社、组已要求购买双轮双铧犁一百零五部。
