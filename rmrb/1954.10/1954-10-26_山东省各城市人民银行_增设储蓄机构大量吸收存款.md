People's Banks in Shandong Province Increase Savings Institutions to Absorb Deposits on a Large Scale

In the second half of this year, People's Banks in various cities of Shandong Province have established a number of small savings institutions. Currently, there are more than 150 savings offices in the province. In Jinan and Qingdao alone, more than 100 savings offices have been established in department stores, cooperatives, factories, schools, and streets in urban areas. The establishment of these small savings institutions has greatly facilitated the deposit and withdrawal of money for urban residents, and the number of people participating in savings has therefore increased even more. According to statistics from 21 cities including Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Weifang, and Zibo, by the end of September, 300,534 households had participated in fixed and current savings, an increase of 127,536 households compared to the end of March this year, of which 96,276 households were added in the third quarter alone. By the beginning of October, the savings of urban residents throughout the province amounted to 562.3 billion yuan, an increase of 170 times compared to the end of 1949, an increase of 58.5 billion yuan compared to the end of 1953, and an increase of 44.8 billion yuan compared to the end of June this year.

    山东省各城市人民银行
    增设储蓄机构大量吸收存款
    今年下半年，山东省各城市人民银行新建立了一批小型储蓄机构，目前全省已有储蓄所一百五十多个。仅济南、青岛两市，就在市区的百货商店、合作社、工厂、学校和街道建立了一百多个储蓄所。这些小型储蓄机构建立以后，大大便利了城市人民存款和取款，参加储蓄的人数因而更加增多。据济南、青岛、烟台、潍坊、淄博等二十一个城市的统计，到九月底止，参加定期和活期储蓄的已经有三十万零五千二百三十四户，比今年三月底增加了十二万七千五百三十六户，其中第三季度就增加了九万六千二百七十六户。到十月上旬止，全省城市人民的储蓄款已有五千六百二十三亿元，比一九四九年年底增加了一百七十倍，比一九五三年年底增加了五百八十五亿元，比今年六月底也增加了四百四十八亿元。　（曹广森）
