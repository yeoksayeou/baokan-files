Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, October 15th: The Spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement protesting the Thai government's recent decision to expel Vietnamese nationals from Thai territory and its preparation to forcibly hand over these Vietnamese nationals to the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government.

The statement pointed out that the Vietnamese nationals in Thailand—numbering more than 50,000 in total—have mostly lived in Thailand for a long time. They have always made a peaceful living and have strictly abided by Thai laws, respecting Thai customs and habits. The Thai people and the Thai local authorities have never been dissatisfied with these Vietnamese residents.

However, despite this, these Vietnamese nationals are forced to live under an increasingly harsh system. They have no freedom of movement or freedom to choose a place to live, and even their right to work and make a living are subject to many restrictions. Since 1953, atrocities against Vietnamese nationals have become even more frequent.

The statement went on to point out that the Thai government decided in August to expel Vietnamese nationals from Thai territory, using the so-called guarantee of Thai security as an excuse to justify its unjust and inhumane policies. Recently, foreign news agencies said that the Thai government plans to hand over Vietnamese nationals to the Ngo Dinh Diem government, even though they do not want this and have asked the Thai government to allow them to live peacefully in Thailand.

The statement pointed out that the measures taken by the Thai government against Vietnamese nationals are incompatible with the inherent friendship between the Thai and Vietnamese people and do not conform to the spirit of maintaining friendly and good-neighborly relations between the two countries.

The statement said that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, lackeys of the American imperialists, are in dire need of manpower to serve as cannon fodder and work on rubber plantations. Handing over these Vietnamese nationals to the Ngo Dinh Diem clique means forcing them into a dangerous situation. Moreover, most of these Vietnamese nationals in Thailand have no relatives in South Vietnam south of the temporary military demarcation line, and their original home is not South Vietnam. Therefore, this measure by the Thai government is unreasonable.

The statement concluded by saying that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people strongly protest the policy of the Thai government and its expulsion of Vietnamese nationals, disregarding their legitimate desire to make a peaceful living in Thailand.

    越南民主共和国外交部发言人发表声明
    抗议泰国政府决定驱逐在泰国的越南国民
    【新华社十七日讯】据越南通讯社北越十五日讯：越南民主共和国外交部发言人发表了一项声明，抗议泰国政府最近决定把越南国民逐出泰国国土，并准备强制地把这些越南国民交给南越吴庭艳政府。
    声明指出，在泰国的越南国民——总共有五万多人——大多数是在泰国住了很久的。他们一直是在和平地谋求生计，而且一直严格遵守泰国的法律，尊重泰国的风俗和习惯。泰国人民和泰国的地方当局从来未曾对这些越南居民有过不满。
    但是尽管如此，这些越南国民还是被迫生活在越来越严厉的制度之下。他们没有行动自由和选择移居地的自由，甚至劳动权和谋生权都受到很多限制。自从一九五三年以来，对越南国民所干的暴行更加层出不穷。
    声明接着指出，泰国政府在八月间决定把越南国民逐出泰国国土，并以所谓保证泰国治安作为借口来替它的违反正义和人道的政策进行辩解。最近外国通讯社说，泰国政府计划把越南国民交给吴庭艳政府，虽然他们不希望如此，并且曾要求泰国政府允许他们在泰国和平地安居下去。
    声明指出，泰国政府对越南国民所采取的措施是同泰国人民和越南人民之间的固有友谊不相容的，是和两国之间应保持友好善邻关系的精神不符合的。
    声明说，美帝国主义者的仆从吴庭艳集团正需要人力替他们当炮灰和在橡胶园中工作。把这些越南国民交给吴庭艳集团，就意味着迫使他们陷入危险的境地。况且，这些在泰国的越南国民大多数在临时军事分界线以南的南越没有亲属，而且他们的原籍也不是南越。因此，泰国政府的这种措施是不合理的。
    声明最后说，越南民主共和国政府和越南人民对于泰国政府的政策，以及不顾越南国民在泰国和平地谋求生计的合法愿望而驱逐他们的作法，提出强硬抗议。
