    Guarantee the Completion of This Year's River-Sea Transportation Plan
    Zhang Qizong
    River-sea transportation occupies an important position in China's transportation industry. Many industrial construction materials and daily necessities for the people must be transported to various places via the Yangtze River, other large rivers, and sea routes. Especially this year, in order to reduce the burden on railway transportation and rationally utilize the efficiency of various modes of transportation, the proportion of river-sea transportation has increased even more than in previous years. Major routes such as the Yangtze River, the Songhua River, and the coastal Bohai Sea routes north of the Yangtze River estuary have a planned annual freight volume that is 30 percent higher than the actual performance last year. They are responsible for transporting grain and local specialties from the southwest, as well as transporting large quantities of materials such as coal, grain, hardware, and timber from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the coast. Among these, grain and coal are the main sources of goods for river-sea transportation, accounting for 56 percent of the total freight volume on the Yangtze River and 54 percent of the total freight volume on the coastal Bohai Sea routes. Therefore, completing the river-sea transportation plan is extremely important for ensuring the supply of industrial construction and the needs of the people's lives.
    Looking at the implementation of the plan by river-sea transportation enterprises from January to September, due to the state's implementation of rational transportation, the source of goods is relatively sufficient. Generally, enterprises have promoted planned management, strengthened operational plans, scheduling systems, and river-sea combined transportation work, and successively carried out port production reforms. In particular, the production enthusiasm of employees has been improved, and they have established confidence in the annual plan and played a guaranteeing role. Therefore, the freight volume from January to September has reached 77 percent of the annual plan, and the freight turnover has reached 70 percent of the annual plan. In particular, the completion of the coastal transportation plan is relatively good. The freight volume completed by the Bohai Sea route in September reached the highest record for monthly coastal transportation. Among them, the "Peace No. 5" vessel has created 37 advanced voyages in the first nine months of this year. This shows that although this year's plan requirements are higher than last year's, it is entirely possible to complete and over fulfill the annual plan as long as efforts are made to improve business management.
    The transportation plans for the past three quarters have been basically completed, but there is still a long way to go to meet the annual transportation tasks. Now there are only two months left until the end of the year. Completing approximately 30 percent of various annual plan targets within this timeframe is a very urgent task, especially since the Yangtze River shipping has been hampered by floods. In the third quarter, many ports downstream from Shashi suffered from flood disasters, warehouses and wharves were flooded, some sections were impacted by floods, waterways changed, and a large number of ships participated in flood control and rescue operations, which greatly restricted normal transportation activities. Under these circumstances, Yangtze River transportation, which accounts for the largest proportion of the entire waterway transportation, failed to complete the third-quarter plan. Currently, the water level along the Yangtze River has subsided, and the subsequent transportation tasks such as disaster relief are very urgent. A large amount of materials滞运 during the Yangtze River flood season need to be transported quickly. A new tense situation has emerged in river-sea transportation, especially in Yangtze River transportation. Therefore, how to learn from the experiences and lessons of the past three quarters and ensure the completion of the annual plan has become a very important task at present.
    The implementation of the transportation plan in the past three quarters shows that the monthly production in various transportation enterprises is still very uneven. Although there has been improvement this year compared to last year, the fluctuation range of the average daily freight turnover calculated by month in each enterprise is not too large, but the phenomenon of "slack at the beginning, tight in the middle, and rushing at the end" in the monthly production of some enterprises has not changed, and some enterprises are even very serious. Taking the volume of goods dispatched by the Northeast Inland Water Navigation Bureau in each ten-day period of June as an example, the volume of goods dispatched in the last ten days accounted for 54 percent of the total monthly transportation volume, while the volume dispatched in the first ten days only accounted for 16 percent; the volume of goods dispatched by the Guangzhou Maritime Bureau in the last ten days of June accounted for 53 percent of the total for the month. Judging from the transportation situation along the entire Yangtze River in the first ten days of October, this uneven phenomenon has not been overcome. As a result, on the one hand, a lot of transportation capacity is lost, and on the other hand, the transportation of goods is backlogged.
    There are still many shortcomings in the operational plans and scheduling work of river-sea transportation enterprises. The connection between Yangtze River and coastal transportation, between river-sea transportation and railway transportation, and between consignors and carriers is not close enough. The loading and unloading efficiency of ports is not compatible with the throughput tasks, and the organization of goods is not perfect. Therefore, port congestion, cargo backlog, high cargo damage rates, uneven arrival of ships, wharf congestion, and excessive non-productive berthing time of ships have been caused. For example, only 62 percent of the voyage plans for state-owned freighters, tankers, and joint state-private vessels on the Bohai Sea route in June arrived and departed according to plan. When approving the shipping plans that connect sea and land, there was a lack of coordination with the railway department, which once caused grain congestion and timber backlog in Dalian Port. Due to the above reasons, the number of lost transportation capacity is very large. Calculating only the state-owned vessels on the Yangtze River and the state-owned and joint state-private vessels on the coast (excluding South China) from January to May, non-productive berthing accounted for 48.84 percent of the total berthing time, resulting in a loss of 9.34 million ton-days.
    Although the number of water transportation accidents has decreased, serious accidents still occur, and various prevention efforts are not satisfactory.
    In order to complete the current tight transportation tasks, in terms of Yangtze River transportation, we should seize the opportunity of the flood receding to handle the grain transportation in the Sichuan River, the coal transportation in Yuxikou and Pukou, and the transportation of industrial production materials in various places. We should conduct a thorough survey of freight along the route; improve the accuracy of plans and strengthen scheduling leadership to completely overcome port congestion and the passive and chaotic phenomenon in transportation, and give full play to the efficiency of ship utilization; and conduct a comprehensive inspection of the wharves and warehouses that have been flooded and damaged, and quickly repair and restore them. In terms of waterway engineering, we should immediately complete the work of restoring navigational marks and relocating navigational marks, especially the work of restoring coastal light beacons, so as to ensure Yangtze River night navigation; the mechanical and electrical departments should pay close attention to the technical condition of ships and specifically arrange ship repair work. All employees of various Yangtze River transportation enterprises should continue to give play to the spirit of creating new records in the production increase and economy practice movement in December last year, and take on the tense task of this year's peak season transportation.
    Coastal transportation must also be tense up. Maritime transport workers should not only complete their own annual plans, but also make up for the volume that water transport failed to complete due to the impact of floods this year by over fulfilling the plan. To this end, in the peak season transportation, we must continue to thoroughly implement the operation plan, and on the basis of shortening the non-productive berthing time of ships in the third quarter, continue to shorten it by 25 to 30 percent; we must continue to strengthen technical leadership, improve equipment utilization efficiency and ship repair quality, and improve the management organization of port machinery.
    In order to ensure the completion of the annual plan, river-sea transportation enterprises at all levels must ensure safe transportation and strictly prevent water transportation accidents. Continue to take active preventive measures, strengthen labor discipline and various safety responsibility systems, and strive to reduce accidents and eliminate accidents; all port transportations should improve safety responsibility systems such as loading and unloading, stacking, fire prevention, corrosion prevention, and ventilation, attach importance to labor protection work, and strengthen safety technical management; all mechanical and electrical departments should strengthen the maintenance of transportation equipment and strictly implement the preventive inspection system for safe transportation.
    There is not much time left this year. Employees of shipping companies, take active action, vigorously tap potential, organize labor competitions focusing on technological innovation, and ensure the completion of this year's river-sea transportation plan.

    保证完成今年的江海运输计划
    张启宗
    江海运输在我国运输业中占有重要的位置。许多工业建设的器材和人民生活必需品，都要经过长江大河和海上航线运转各地。特别是今年，为了减轻铁路运输的负担，合理地发挥各种运输的效能，江海运输的比重更比往年增加。主要的航线如长江、松花江及长江口以北的沿海北洋航线，全年计划运量比去年实绩增长百分之三十，担负着西南粮食和土特产外运，以及长江下游和沿海煤、粮、五金、木材等大量物资的运输。其中粮、煤是江海运输的主要货源，它在长江货运总额中占百分之五十六，在沿海北洋航线的货运总额中占百分之五十四。因此完成江海运输计划对于保证工业建设和人民生活需要的供应有极重要的作用。
    从一至九月江海运输企业执行计划的情况看，由于国家开始实行合理运输，货源比较充足，各企业一般都推行了计划管理，加强了作业计划、调度制度和江海联运工作，并陆续进行了港口生产改革，特别是提高了职工的生产积极性，对年度计划树立了信心和发挥了保证作用，因此一至九月份的货运量已达年计划的百分之七十七，货运周转量已达年计划的百分之七十。特别是沿海运输完成计划的情况比较好。九月份北洋航线完成的货运量达到沿海月度运输的最高纪录，其中和平五号轮在今年九个月内已创造了三十七个先进航次。由此可见：今年计划要求虽比去年提高了，但只要努力改善经营管理，完成和超额完成全年计划是完全可能的。
    已往三个季度的运输计划已基本完成了，但对于全年运输任务来说还有很大的距离。现在距年底只剩两个多月了，要在这个期限内完成约为百分之三十的各种年度计划指标，是一个十分紧迫的任务，特别是长江航运曾受到洪水的障碍。在第三季度中，自沙市以下，许多港口遭受洪水灾害，仓库码头被水淹了，若干地段受洪水冲激，航道有了变迁，大批船舶参加防汛抢险，正常的运输活动受到很大的限制。在这种情况下，占整个水路运输中比重最大的长江运输没有能完成第三季度计划。目前长江沿线水势已经平复，接着而来的救灾等运输任务十分紧迫，长江汛期所滞运的大量物资又急需运走，目前在江海运输，特别是长江运输上已出现了新的紧张局面。因此，如何吸取过去三个季度的经验教训，确保全年计划的完成，就成为当前十分重要的工作。
    过去三个季度运输计划执行的情况表明，各个运输企业中月度生产还很不均衡。虽然今年比去年已有了改进，各企业按月计算的平均每天货运周转量的波动幅度尚不太大，但某些企业月度生产“上松、中紧、下赶”的现象尚未改变，有些企业甚至还很严重。以东北内河航运局六月份各旬发货吨数来看，下旬发货吨数占了月度总运量的百分之五十四，上旬却只占百分之十六；广州海运局六月下旬发货吨数占了全月的百分之五十三。就十月上旬长江全线运输情况看，这种不均衡现象也未克服。因而一方面运力损失很大，一方面货物运输又有积压。
    江海运输企业的作业计划与调度工作都还存在许多缺点，长江与沿海运输之间、江海运输与铁路运输之间以及托运与承运部门之间的联系还不够密切，港口的装卸效率与吞吐任务还不相适应，组织货源的工作还不完善，因此，曾造成港口堵塞，货物积压，货损率高，到港船舶不均衡，码头拥挤以及船舶非生产停泊时间过长等现象。例如北洋航线六月份国营货轮、油轮及公私合营船舶的航次计划，只有百分之六十二按计划到发。在批准海陆衔接的托运计划时，又与铁道部门缺乏联系，曾经一度造成了大连港粮食堵塞和木材积压的情况。由于以上种种原因，损失运力数字很大，仅就一至五月份长江国营轮舶、沿海国营和公私合营轮舶（不包括华南）计算，非生产停泊占总停泊时间的百分之四十八点八四，损失九百三十四万吨日。
    水上运输事故的次数虽有减少，但严重的事故还有发生，各种预防工作也做得不能令人满意。
    为了完成当前紧张的运输任务，在长江运输方面，应抓紧洪水平复以后的川江粮运，裕溪口和浦口的煤炭运输，以及各地工业生产器材的运输，做好沿线货运的摸底工作；提高计划准确程度，加强调度领导，彻底克服港口拥挤和运输上忙乱被动现象，充分发挥船舶运用效率；对于受水浸淹和遭受损坏的码头、仓库都要进行全面检查，迅速修整与恢复；在航道工程上应立即做好航标恢复工作和航标移置工作，尤其要做好沿岸灯标恢复工作，以便保证长江夜航；机务部门要密切注意船舶技术状态，具体安排修船工作。长江运输各企业的全体职工，应继续发挥去年十二月在增产节约运动中创造新纪录的精神，担当起今年旺季运输的紧张任务。
    沿海运输方面也必须紧张起来。海运职工不仅应完成本身的年度计划，而且还应当以超额完成计划来弥补今年水上运输因洪水影响而未能完成的运量。为此，在旺季运输中，必须继续深入贯彻作业计划，在三季度已经缩短船舶非生产停泊时间的基础上，再继续缩短百分之二十五至三十；必须继续加强技术领导，提高设备使用效率和修船质量，健全港口机械的管理组织。
    为了保证年度计划的完成，各级江海运输企业，必须确保安全运输，严防发生水上运输事故。继续采取积极的预防措施，加强劳动纪律与各种安全责任制，力求减少事故与消灭事故；各港口运输应健全装卸、堆存、防火、防腐、通风等安全责任制，重视劳动保护工作，加强安全技术管理；各机务部门应加强运输设备的保养维修，严格执行安全运输的预防检查制度。
    今年的时间已经不多了，航运企业的职工们，积极行动起来，大力发掘潜力，组织以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛，确保今年江海运输计划的完成。
