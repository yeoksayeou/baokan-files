Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, October 22nd: The labor productivity of basic construction workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company is gradually increasing. In the first three quarters of this year, eight basic construction workers created more value than ten basic construction workers in the same period last year. This achievement was made on the basis of labor productivity doubling last year compared to 1951.

Since the beginning of this year, a series of joyous events such as the general election and the promulgation of the Constitution, as well as major measures to expand piece-rate wages, have stimulated the enthusiasm of workers for labor competitions. Labor quotas are constantly being exceeded. So far, the basic construction workers of Anshan Iron and Steel have exceeded the national labor quota by an average of 18 percent.

On the basis of the significant improvement in the technical level of workers after winter training, the basic construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel has systematically promoted 34 advanced experiences this year, such as Wang Jinzhong's concrete pouring method, Han Qingchen's double-handed mortar bricklaying method, and fish-scale layered excavation method, which have increased worker productivity by 10 to 70 percent. The basic construction department has implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts and launched a campaign for workers to put forward rationalization proposals, which has also improved this year. Hundreds of suggestions regarding improving tools, improving operating methods, and improving labor organization have been adopted or implemented. Since the first workshop of the Basic Construction Metal Structure Creation Plant scientifically arranged mechanical equipment according to the production process and implemented assembly line operations, the number of workers has been reduced by more than 500 compared to last year, while the output of metal products has increased by one-third.

The conditions for construction mechanization and factory production have been further improved compared to last year, which is also one of the main factors for the increase in labor productivity this year. Each construction unit has added more than 500 bulldozers, cranes, and other machinery this year. The main types of machinery have increased from 15 to 24, and the utilization rate has reached or exceeded the national quota.

The labor force in various basic construction departments has also been allocated on a quarterly and monthly basis according to plan, thus reducing idle work. In the second quarter alone, 170,000 workdays were transferred to support construction projects in Shenyang and other places.

Due to the increase in labor productivity, many workers have exceeded the national labor quota, and their monthly wages have also increased.

Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: Employees of the Directly Subordinate Engineering Company of the Construction Engineering Department, which is undertaking the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, have widely launched a production increase and thrift competition, and have already made preliminary achievements.

Workers of all trades in the 103rd work zone under this company have increased production and saved more than 1.533 billion yuan in wealth in the past three months in terms of saving materials and using waste materials. The 102nd work zone estimates that it will complete the plan to increase production, save money, and reduce costs by more than 1.133 billion yuan by the end of October. The materials department used to have serious waste, but after the anti-waste campaign, it has saved more than 12 billion yuan in various expenses by the end of September, and they are confident that they will save the country 16 billion yuan this year. Employees of the processing plant under the Enterprise Department, in coordination with the needs of construction, overfulfilled the production and processing tasks of wood products, steel components, and steel bars. The value of increased production and savings, according to the September statistics of the woodworking factory, reached 2.3 billion yuan.

In August and September, the study and discussion of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China by the broad masses of employees further improved their enthusiasm for protecting state property and promoted the development of the production increase and thrift campaign. When cutting galvanized iron, the workers of the Shi Xiangchen group in the 103rd work zone carefully calculated and tried to use waste materials, saving more than 180 sheets of galvanized iron, worth more than 40 million yuan. The fourth group of the twelfth team of the 108th Army Engineering Zone used their rest time to collect a large number of small pieces of wood from ditches and under walls, and made 3,000 wooden bricks for dormitories in August, which reduced the amount of wood they needed, saving them more than 3.3 million yuan. The staff of the materials department selected materials with good quality and low prices in many ways, tried to reduce the number of intermediate handling of materials, and actively promoted stagnant materials. The value of stagnant materials sold in August and September alone reached more than 17 billion yuan. The employees of the mechanized supply station automatically inspect and maintain various machines every day to improve the utilization rate of the machines. In September, the number of various machines dispatched every day and night reached a record high, which effectively ensured the overfulfillment of the construction tasks in September.

In the production increase and thrift competition, many units have begun to improve various management tasks and improve their management level. The 102nd work zone implemented a grass-roots economic accounting system in more than 30 groups, reducing material consumption, strengthening the allocation of labor, and eliminating idle work in construction. In September, each group saved more than 150 million yuan in labor and material costs. The 101st and 103rd work zones comprehensively promoted the piece-rate wage system, which increased the workers' enthusiasm for labor. The 103rd work zone overfulfilled the daily indicators every day in September and saved more than 3,500 workdays.

    鞍钢基本建设工人的劳动生产率逐步提高
    第一汽车厂建筑工人开展增产节约竞赛
    据新华社鞍山二十二日电：鞍山钢铁公司基本建设工人的劳动生产率正在逐步提高。今年的前三个季度中，八个基本建设工人创造的价值，比去年同期十个基本建设工人创造的还多。这个成就并且是在去年劳动生产率比一九五一年提高一倍的基础上取得的。
    今年以来，普选和宪法的公布等一连串喜事和扩大计件工资面的重大措施，激励了职工们劳动竞赛的热情。劳动定额不断被突破，到现在为止，鞍钢基本建设工人平均已超过国家劳动定额百分之十八。
    在工人经过冬季训练技术水平显著提高的基础上，今年鞍钢基本建设部门有计划地推广了王进忠混凝土浇灌法、韩庆臣双手蘸浆砌砖法、鱼鳞式分层挖土法等三十四种先进经验，使得工人生产效率因此提高百分之十到七十以上。基本建设部门贯彻苏联专家建议，发动职工提合理化建议的工作，今年也有了改进。已有几百条关于改进工具、改善操作方法、改进劳动组织等方面的建议被采纳或贯彻。基本建设金属结构创造厂第一车间，自从按生产工艺过程科学地安排机械设备，实行流水作业以后，现在工人比去年减少五百多人，而金属制品产量却提高了三分之一。
    施工机械化、工厂化的条件比去年进一步完善，也是今年劳动生产率提高的主要因素之一。各施工单位今年新增加了五百多台推土机、吊车等机械，主要机械已由十五种增加到二十四种，利用率也达到或超过了国家定额。
    基本建设各部门劳动力也已做到按计划逐季逐月进行调配，因此窝工现象减少，仅第二季度就有十七万个工作日调出支援沈阳等地建设工程。
    由于劳动生产率提高，许多职工超过国家劳动定额，他们每月的工资收入也都增加了。
    【新华社二十二日讯】承建第一汽车制造厂的建筑工程部直属工程公司职工广泛开展增产节约竞赛，并已作出初步成绩。
    这个公司所属一零三工区各工种工人最近三个月来在节省材料、利用废料等方面增产节约了十五亿三千多万元的财富。一零二工区估计到十月底可全部完成今年增产节约和降低成本十一亿三千多万元的计划。材料部门过去浪费现象严重，经过反浪费运动，到九月底已节约各种费用达一百二十多亿元，他们有信心在今年给国家节约一百六十亿元。企业处所属加工厂职工配合施工需要，超额完成了木制品、钢构件、钢筋的生产和加工任务，增产和节约的价值，据木工厂九月份统计，就达二十三亿元。
    在八、九月间，广大职工对中华人民共和国宪法草案的学习和讨论，进一步提高了爱护国家财产的积极性，推动了增产节约竞赛的开展。一零三工区时向辰小组工人剪裁白铁时精打细算，设法利用废料，共节约白铁一百八十多张，价值四千多万元。一零八部队工区十二中队四小组利用休息时间，从水沟里、墙角下收集大批小木块，八月间作了三千块宿舍用木砖，计少领了价值三百三十多万元的木材。材料部门的工作人员多方选购质量好、价格低的材料，设法减少材料中间搬运的次数，并积极向外推销呆滞材料，仅八、九两月份推销出去的呆滞材料价值就达一百七十多亿元。机械化供应站职工每天都自动检修和保养各种机械，提高机械运用率。九月份每昼夜出动的各种机械台数曾达最高纪录，有力地保证了九月份施工任务的超额完成。
    在增产节约竞赛中，很多单位都开始改进各项管理工作，提高了管理水平。一零二工区在三十多个小组施行基层经济核算制度，减少了材料的消耗，加强了劳动力的调配，消灭了施工中的窝工现象，九月份各小组节省工料费一亿五千多万元。一零一、一零三等工区全面推行计件工资制，工人的劳动热情更高，一零三工区九月份每天都超额完成日指标，并节省了三千五百多个工作日。
