As the floodwaters gradually recede, the supply and marketing cooperatives in the flood-stricken areas of Hubei Province have returned to their original locations one after another to carry out supply and marketing operations and welcome the return of disaster victims. According to statistics from early October, 70 percent of the supply and marketing cooperatives in Jianli County have resumed work. Most of the supply and marketing cooperatives in Mianyang County are operating in sheds in their original market towns. Of the 29 distribution outlets of the Hanyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative that had been relocated with the disaster victims, 16 have moved back.

After the floods this summer, these supply and marketing cooperatives moved with the disaster victims and persisted in providing supplies. They adopted methods such as carrying loads, setting up stalls, and mobile supply on boats, which solved many difficulties for the disaster victims in production and life during the flood period and were supported by the masses. At present, the supply and marketing cooperatives in areas that have not yet receded from the floodwaters are still adhering to their operations in the relocated areas.

In order to help disaster victims settle down and carry out self-rescue movements, cooperative departments in various places are actively organizing sources of goods. The Xiaogan Prefectural Cooperative Section has allocated more than 18,000 cubic meters of China fir, 200 cubic meters of miscellaneous wood, and 166,000 nan bamboo poles to the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties. The Huanggang Prefectural Cooperative Section has signed a contract with the Henan Provincial Cooperative Department to purchase 250,000 reed mats, which are currently being allocated and transported. The Jingjiang County Cooperative has organized 190 million yuan worth of production materials such as hemp thread, rope, and hooks, and has organized 340 million yuan worth of building materials such as bamboo poles, bamboo, bamboo strips, wire, and China fir. Jianli County can currently guarantee the supply of production materials such as vegetable seeds and fishing gear.

Recently, the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Preparatory Committee allocated another 10,800 catties of yellow silk and 1.12 million catties of ramie to the grassroots cooperatives in the Jingzhou, Xiaogan, and Huanggang special districts to supply disaster victims for engaging in sideline production.

    湖北省水灾地区供销合作社转回原地工作
    随着江水逐渐退落，湖北省水灾地区的供销合作社已先后回到原地，开展供销业务，迎接灾民回乡。据十月初统计：监利县的供销合作社有百分之七十恢复工作；沔阳县大部分供销社都在原来集镇上搭棚营业；汉阳县供销社原来随灾民转移出去的二十九个分销店，已有十六个搬回。
    这些供销社在今夏水灾发生后，都随着灾民转移，坚持供应业务。并采用挑担子、摆摊子和船上流动供应等方法，在水灾期间解决了灾民在生产、生活上许多困难，受到群众的拥护。现在部分尚未退水的地区的供销社，仍在转移地区坚持业务。
    为了帮助灾民安家和开展自救运动，各地合作部门正积极组织货源，孝感专署合作科已拨发各县供销社杉木一万八千多立方公尺，杂木二百立方公尺、楠竹十六万六千根。黄冈专署合作科已与河南省合作部门订立了收购二十五万条芦席的合同，现正调拨转运中。荆江县合作社已组织了麻线、?、钩等生产资料一亿九千万元；组织皮篙、竹子、子篾、铁丝、杉木等建筑器材三亿四千余万元。监利县目前菜种、渔具等生产资料都能保证供应。
    最近，湖北省供销合作社筹备委员会又拨给荆州、孝感、黄冈三个专区的基层社黄丝一万零八百斤，线麻一百十二万斤，供应灾民进行副业生产。
