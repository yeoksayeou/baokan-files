    Chairman Mao's Telegram to Premier Kim Il-sung
    To Comrade Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea:
    I have received your telegram of October 24, 1954. On behalf of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, and in my own name, I express my heartfelt thanks and respect to the entire Korean people, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and to you.
    The heroic Korean and Chinese people have forged a flesh-and-blood fighting friendship in the just struggle against aggression and in defense of peace. This friendship is an important factor in maintaining peace in the Far East. In the struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea and to safeguard peace in Asia, this friendship between our two peoples will surely be further consolidated and developed.
    I sincerely wish the Korean people even greater achievements in the solemn task of rapidly restoring their national economy.
    Mao Zedong
    October 25, 1954, Beijing
