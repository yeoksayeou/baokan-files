Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 23rd. According to TASS: Following the passage of the London Agreements, Bonn's revanchists are accelerating preparations to dress the already established disguised army in legitimate military uniforms, and are drafting plans for the distribution areas, material supply, and training of the revanchist army.

In West Germany, the work of re-establishing the former Hitler army has been proceeding systematically and purposefully for several years. So far, an army that has been disguised as the core of the "Defense Force" has been established. This army is commanded by former fascist generals of the "Defense Force" and is equipped with rapid-fire weapons, machine guns, grenade launchers, artillery, and light tanks. The number of these troops had reached about 180,000 by the middle of this year. The so-called "German Service Units," belonging to the armed forces of Western countries, were established as early as 1948, with approximately 150,000 people disguised as "industrial police," "guards," and "worker" battalions. These troops are also equipped with American-made weapons. In addition, there are about 100,000 so-called military auxiliary forces, which are the reserve force of West Germany's aggressor army. The total number of these military forces amounts to more than 400,000, which almost meets the figure of 500,000 West German troops stipulated in the London Agreements.

Leaders of the "Blank Office" believe that, according to the London Agreements, the West German army will soon be established. Currently, the "Blank Office" is drafting plans for the distribution areas, material supply, and training of the future West German army.

According to qualified sources close to Blank, the plan stipulates that, in certain circumstances, new "Defense Force" units will be distributed outside the territory of the Federal Republic. For example, a group of personnel from the "Blank Office," led by General Heusinger, is drafting plans to distribute several divisions of the West German army on the Jutland Peninsula and all important islands within Denmark. According to qualified sources, the drafting of this plan is being carried out with the consent and approval of the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's armed forces.

In order to prepare for a new war of revenge, the Bonn rulers are also using various veterans' associations to preserve the bellicose traditions of Prussian militarism. Currently, there are approximately 600 veterans' associations in West Germany, led by former Hitler generals and officers. Thousands upon thousands of books, magazines, and pamphlets are spreading the myth of the "invincibility" of the German army and are enticing German youth to participate in a "victorious war."

    西德加紧重建侵略军
    【新华社柏林二十三日电】据塔斯社讯：在伦敦协议通过以后，波恩复仇主义者正在加紧准备给已经建立起来的伪装的军队穿上合法的军衣，并正在拟订复仇军的分布地区、物资供应和训练的计划。
    在西德，重新建立前希特勒军队的工作已经有步骤有计划地进行了好几年了。到目前为止，一直在伪装中的一支作为“国防军”核心的军队已经建立起来。这支军队由前“国防军”的法西斯将领统率，得到速射武器、机关枪、掷弹筒、大炮和轻型坦克的装备。这些部队的人数在今年年中已达十八万左右。属于西方国家武装部队的所谓“德国服务队”早在一九四八年就已经成立，其中约有十五万人伪装成“工业警察”、“哨兵”和“工人”大队。这些部队也用美制的武器来装备。此外，还有所谓军事辅助部队十万人，他们是西德侵略军队的后备力量。以上几种军事部队的人数合起来共有四十多万人，几乎符合了伦敦协议上所规定的建立五十万西德军队的数字。
      “布兰克部”的领导人认为，根据伦敦协议，西德军队不久就要成立了。目前，“布兰克部”正在拟订未来的西德军的分布地区、物资供应和训练的计划。
    据最接近布兰克的有资格人士说，这个计划规定，在某些情况下，新“国防军”部队将分布在联邦共和国领土之外。例如，“布兰克部”的一批工作人员在许辛格将军的领导下，正在拟订将西德军队的若干师分布在丹麦境内的日德兰半岛和所有的重要岛屿上的计划。又据有资格人士说，这个计划的拟订工作是在北大西洋联盟武装部队司令部的同意和批准之下进行的。
    为了准备新的复仇战争，波恩统治者还利用各种军人联合会来保存普鲁士军国主义的好战传统。在目前，西德约有六百个由前希特勒的将领和军官领导的军人联合会。成千成万册的书籍、杂志和小册子又在散布德国军队“无敌”的神话，又在引诱德国青年参加一个“胜利的战争”。
