    Farmers in Renwang Township, Xinxiang County, Henan Province, have gradually developed the habit of arranging production and consumption according to national plans.
    More than 80 percent of the farming households in Renwang Township have now joined agricultural production cooperatives. This spring, all agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the township signed contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives for the pre-purchase of cotton and wheat. Farmers actively expanded cotton fields according to national plans and planted many sunflowers and hemp and other crops in the empty spaces along the edges of fields and plots. The First Agricultural Production Cooperative originally stipulated in the pre-purchase contract that it would sell 120,000 jin of seed cotton. After the wheat harvest, the cooperative expanded wheat stubble cotton by 185 mu in accordance with the national plan. They now estimate that the amount of cotton they can sell to the state will be much more than the amount stipulated in the original contract. In the past, farmers in this township were accustomed to processing seed cotton into lint cotton for sale, leaving the cottonseed for livestock feed and fertilizer. This year, since the state proposed the planned purchase of vegetable oilseeds, members of agricultural production cooperatives have actively sought ways and means, finding many things that can replace cottonseed as feed and fertilizer, and no longer process lint cotton, but sell seed cotton to the state. Now is the cotton harvest season. Agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives have uniformly signed pre-purchase contracts and collectively sell cotton. All the money earned from selling cotton every day, in addition to paying pre-purchase deposits and due state loans, is sent to credit cooperatives for storage. If members of agricultural production cooperatives need money, they apply through proper procedures for approval from the cooperative's committee, and then go to the credit cooperative to withdraw it. Farmers purchase daily necessities at the township supply and marketing cooperative's store, according to the quantity planned by the state, using cloth coupons and oil coupons. In the past, farmers would eat and drink freely after selling cotton, and go to fairs everywhere to buy grain. This phenomenon no longer exists. Farmers Zhao Shiwen and Li Jinzhang used to eat and drink heavily after harvesting cotton, but in the spring they would borrow grain and incur debts everywhere. Since the state implemented planned purchase and supply of grain last winter, their families have carefully arranged their lives according to the state's planned supply standards, and members of agricultural production cooperatives often gave them advice. This year, not only did they not incur debts, but Li Jinzhang's family also added three new tiled houses with the money they saved.

    河南省新乡县仁旺乡农民
    逐渐养成按计划生产和消费的习惯
    河南省新乡县仁旺乡农民，已逐渐养成了按照国家计划安排生产和消费的习惯。
    仁旺乡全乡参加农业生产合作社的户数，现在已占全乡农户总数的百分之八十以上。今年春天，全乡农业生产合作社和互助组都和供销合作社订立了预购棉花和小麦的合同。农民们按照国家计划积极扩大棉田，并在场边和地头的空地上种了许多向日葵和大麻子等作物。第一农业生产合作社今年原订预购合同规定卖籽棉十二万斤。麦收以后，社里按照国家计划扩大麦茬棉花一百八十五亩，现在他们计算能够卖给国家的棉花数量，将比原来合同规定的数量多得多。过去这个乡农民都很习惯把籽棉加工轧成皮棉后再出卖，留下棉籽做牲畜的饲料和肥料；今年，自从国家提出要计划收购植物油料以后，农业生产合作社社员们都积极想办法，找窍门，找出了很多可以代替棉籽做饲料和肥料的东西，都不再加工轧皮棉，而把籽棉卖给国家。现在正是棉花收获季节。农业生产合作社和供销合作社统一订立了预购合同，集体出卖棉花，每天卖棉花得来的钱除了交付预购订金和到期了的国家贷款以外，全都送到信用合作社里去储存。农业生产合作社社员需用钱，都经过正当手续申请社务委员会批准，以后再到信用合作社里去支取。农民们按照国家规定的计划供应数量，拿着布票和油票，到乡里供销合作社的门市部里去购买日用生活必需品。过去农民卖掉棉花以后，随意吃喝，到处赶集买粮食，这种现象已经不存在了。农民赵士文、李金章，往年收下棉花以后就大吃大喝，到了春天却到处借粮欠债。自从去年冬天国家实行了粮食计划收购和计划供应，家里按照国家规定的计划供应标准细密地安排生活，农业生产合作社社员也常常向他俩提意见，今年他俩不只没有欠债，李金章家并且用节约出来的钱添盖了三间新瓦房。　（新华社）
