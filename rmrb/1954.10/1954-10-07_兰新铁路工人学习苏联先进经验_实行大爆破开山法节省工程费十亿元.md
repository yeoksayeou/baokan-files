    Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Workers Learn from Soviet Advanced Experience
    Implement Large-Scale Blasting Method to Save 1 Billion Yuan in Project Costs
    The workers constructing the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway recently conducted a large-scale blasting operation, using a single blast to remove half of the Falling Cliff, which had been hindering the progress of the project westward.
    The Falling Cliff is more than 180 meters high. The rock is weathered and has been subjected to seismic activity, causing loose rocks to fall to the ground frequently. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway must pass through this area, which poses a serious threat to current construction and future traffic. To accelerate the progress of the project, the construction workers adopted the Soviet large-scale blasting method.
    The work of drilling the blast holes began. The workers resolutely guaranteed to the Party: "We will not leave the mountain until the big gun is fired!" After the pilot tunnels for the blast holes were dug more than 20 meters long, the tunnels became curved and narrow, and the air inside was thin. In addition, the smell of gunpowder and the rock dust splashed up by the pneumatic drills made it difficult for the workers inside to breathe. Later, Liu Jinghua, a member of the Communist Youth League, proposed using a pulley to pull a wind pipe into the tunnel, which shortened the smoke evacuation time. Worker Wang Fucheng proposed wrapping the pneumatic drill rod with wet burlap, eliminating the rock dust splashing during drilling. At the same time, the workers collectively studied the method of using handcarts to remove the slag and laying iron plates inside the tunnel, which overcame the difficulty of slag removal inside the tunnel and accelerated the progress of the project. Originally, the progress of excavating pilot tunnels for blast holes was 8 inches per shift, but later the highest reached 1.17 meters. After 36 days and nights of intense construction, on the afternoon of September 3rd, a pilot tunnel for a blast hole, 46 meters long and directly hitting the "heart" of the Falling Cliff, was completed. The workers loaded four and a half tons of three different kinds of yellow explosives into the tunnel. At 8:30 p.m. on September 5th, people retreated to a safe area. One person pressed the electric detonator, and with a deafening roar, the left half of the cliff head of the Falling Cliff was mostly blasted away as planned. After measurement, the total volume of rock blasted away in this one blast was 38,324 cubic meters, which would require 3,421 railcars to transport. If these stones were excavated by the 30 workers who were responsible for excavating the pilot tunnels for blast holes using the manual drilling and small blasting method, it would take five and a half years. According to preliminary calculations, the engineering cost saved by this one blast for the country is as much as one billion yuan.

    兰新铁路工人学习苏联先进经验
    实行大爆破开山法节省工程费十亿元
    修筑兰新铁路的工人们最近进行了一次大爆破开山，一炮就炸掉了阻碍工程西进的跌落崖半个山头。
    跌落崖高达一百八十多公尺，石质风化，并受过地震的震动，因而崖上乱石时时向地面跌落。兰新路要从这里修过，现在施工和将来行车受到严重威胁。为了加速工程进度，筑路工人采用了苏联大爆破开山法。
    开凿炮眼的工作开始了。工人们向党坚决保证：“放不响大炮，决不下山”！当炮眼导坑挖到二十多公尺长以后，由于导坑弯曲狭小，峒内空气稀薄，再加上火药爆炸的气味以及打风钻飞溅起来的石粉，使在导坑内工作的工人呼吸困难。后经青年团员刘景华提出用滑车往导坑内拉风管的办法，缩短了导坑内排烟时间；工人王福成提出用湿麻袋片裹住风钻杆工作，消除了打风钻时飞溅石粉。同时，工人们还集体研究用手推车出碴和峒内铺铁板的办法，克服了峒内出碴的困难，加速了工程进度。原来每班开挖炮眼导坑进度是八公寸，后来最高达到一点一七公尺。经过三十六昼夜的紧张施工，到九月三日下午，一条长达四十六公尺直捣跌落崖“心脏”的炮眼导坑挖成了。工人们把三种不同的四公吨半黄色炸药装入峒内。九月五日下午八时半，人们都隐避到了安全地带，只见一人按动了电流导火索，一声震天轰鸣，按照计划跌落崖左半面崖头大部炸掉。经过测量，这一炮炸掉的石头共有三万八千三百二十四公方，这些石头要用火车载运，需占三千四百二十一个车皮；这些石头如果叫这次担任开挖炮眼导坑的三十名工人用人工打眼放小炮的方法施工，需要五年半的时间。这一炮炸掉的石头，据初步计算为国家所节省的工程费用有十亿元之巨。
