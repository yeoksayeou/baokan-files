    The Yellow River has been a notorious scourge since ancient times. However, in the hands of the people, it has begun to obey their commands in the downstream plains where it caused havoc for thousands of years. It now diverts water for irrigation, watering hundreds of thousands of acres of cotton and wheat fields, and replenishes the Wei River, transporting grain and cargo ships to Tianjin, serving to increase agricultural production, facilitate material exchange, and develop the national economy.
      The People's Victory Canal, during its construction, was called the "Yellow River Irrigation and Wei River Replenishment Project." It can divert water from the Yellow River to irrigate 720,000 acres of farmland in Xinxiang, Huojia, Ji County, Yanjin, and other counties north of the Yellow River in Henan Province. It also replenishes the flow of the Wei River during dry seasons, improving navigation along the 900-kilometer stretch from Xinxiang to Tianjin. The project began construction in March 1951 and was fully completed in August 1953. In April 1952, after the completion of some major works, water was released for irrigation and to replenish the Wei River. When the farmers saw the once-harmful floodwaters flowing peacefully into the fields, nourishing the green seedlings, contemplating their future happiness, they said with excitement and gratitude: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Yellow River has become obedient too!" "Chairman Mao can not only reform hooligans but also transform the Yellow River."
    In the early stages of the project, some farmers expressed doubts, saying: Who dares to use Yellow River water to irrigate the land! However, when the Yellow River water flowed peacefully past their villages, they tasted the water, examined the soil deposited in the canals, and gained confidence, demanding to manage the canals well and irrigate the land properly, putting forward the slogan "Use the canal to increase production and build a prosperous and strong new China."
    The intake of the People's Victory Canal is located on the north bank of the Yellow River, west of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bridge, south of Qinchang Village in Wuzhi County, Henan Province. The water intake is controlled by the headgate of the canal. The main canal starts from the headgate, running northeast for about 52 kilometers, and joins the Wei River at Dongguan, Xinxiang City. The intake flow of the headgate is 50 cubic meters per second, with 27 cubic meters per second used for irrigation and 23 cubic meters per second used to replenish the Wei River. On both sides of the main canal, there are lateral canals, branch canals, and tertiary and field canals that directly deliver water to the farmland, as well as drainage ditches at all levels. There are a total of 12,100 canals, with a total length of more than 5,700 kilometers, and a total earthwork volume of more than 16 million cubic meters. In addition, more than 1,400 structures were built on the canals, using more than 130,000 tons of materials.
    After the release of water from the People's Victory Canal, agricultural production and transportation have undergone great changes. In 1952, 280,000 acres of land were irrigated, and the unit area yield of cotton was approximately 200% of the unit area yield of non-irrigated land, and the unit area yield of millet was approximately 290% of non-irrigated land. The total increased production value for that year was approximately 57 billion yuan, equivalent to half of the project's investment. In 1953, the unit area yield of wheat was approximately 150% of non-irrigated land. In 1954, the wheat yield was approximately 160% of non-irrigated land. Now, 530,000 acres are being irrigated, and it can be developed to 720,000 acres in the future.
    The water volume of the Wei River used to be unstable. Usually, wooden boats could only carry 50% to 70% of their capacity. Especially between Xinxiang and Linqing, the water was shallow and the river was narrow, and navigation would be suspended during the dry season. After diverting water from the Yellow River to replenish it, the Wei River's navigation was guaranteed. Wooden boats of 100 tons could be fully loaded. In the future, after improving the Wei River channel, steamships with a load of 200 tons can also be operated. The total freight tonnage completed in the nine months of 1952 was 146% of the total for 1951, and 193% of 1951 in 1953. The freight tonnage in the first half of 1954 was 134% of the same period in 1953. The freight volume is increasing rapidly. If this is combined with the improvement of the Wei River channel, the transportation from this cotton, wheat, and coal-producing area to the sea will be further improved.
    The success of the People's Victory Canal further illustrates that the power of the people can turn a harmful river into a beneficial one, and can make the fierce Yellow River docilely benefit the people. However, this is only the beginning of our use of the Yellow River to serve the people; more magnificent prospects will gradually become a reality with the development of the country's industrialization. According to preliminary investigations, the use of the Yellow River's water can develop a large amount of electricity, irrigate tens of millions of acres of farmland, and facilitate thousands of miles of navigation. The Yellow River basin and its vicinity also have abundant mineral resources, fertile and vast plains, and superior conditions and broad prospects for the development of industry and agriculture. Now, hundreds and thousands of surveyors are distributed in the Loess Plateau, the downstream plains, and the deep valleys of the tributaries, conducting surveys, measurements, and drilling, collecting data for the control of the Yellow River, and preparing for a bright future. The people's demand for the Yellow River to "eliminate harm and maximize benefits" will inevitably be gradually realized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the support of the people of the whole country!

    人民胜利渠
    全国人民代表大会代表
    水利部副部长  张含英
    黄河是自古有名的害河，但是到了人民的手里，它已经在它曾经为害几千年的下游平原上，开始听从人民的指挥，开渠引水，灌溉着几十万亩棉田、麦田，接济卫河，输送着开往天津的粮船、货船，为增加农业生产，为便利物资交流，为发展国民经济而服务了。
      人民胜利渠在施工的时候称作“引黄灌溉济卫工程”，它可以引黄河的水灌溉河南省黄河北岸新乡、获嘉、汲县、延津等县七十二万亩的农田，并且接济卫河枯水时期的流量，以改善新乡到天津九百公里的航运。工程在一九五一年三月开始兴修，在一九五三年八月全部完成，一九五二年四月，在一部分主要工程完成后，就放水灌田并接济卫河。农民们看到从前为害的洪水安详地流到田里滋润着发绿的幼苗，思谋着未来的幸福，满怀着兴奋和感激的心情说：“在共产党和毛主席的领导下，黄河也老实了。”“毛主席不仅能把二流子改造好，还能把黄河改造好。”
    在工程进行的初期，农民们有的表示怀疑说：谁敢放黄水浇地！但是，等到黄水安详地流经村旁，他们尝尝水味，看看渠道沉淀的土质，便增加了信心，要求看好渠道浇好地，提出“要用水渠提高生产，建设富强康乐的新中国”的口号。
    人民胜利渠的引水口在黄河北岸，京汉铁桥以西，河南省武陟县秦厂村以南。控制引水的建筑物是渠首闸。总干渠便从渠首闸起，东北行约五十二公里，到新乡市东关接入卫河。渠首闸进水量是每秒五十立方公尺，用每秒二十七立方公尺的水供给灌溉，每秒二十三立方公尺的水接济卫河。在总干渠的两侧，开掘干渠、支渠和直接送水到农田的斗渠、毛渠，还有各级的排水道。共计渠道一万二千
  一百多条，全长五千七百多公里，全部土工一千六百多万立方公尺。另外在渠道上修建筑物一千四百多座，使用物料十三万多吨。
    人民胜利渠在放水以后，农业生产和交通运输都起了很大的变化。一九五二年灌田二十八万亩，棉花单位面积产量大约相当于未灌水的土地单位面积产量的百分之二百，谷子单位面积产量大约相当未灌水的土地的百分之二百九十。这一年增产总值约为五百七十多亿元，相当于修建工程投资的一半。一九五三年，小麦单位面积产量大约相当于未灌水的土地的百分之一百五十。一九五四年，小麦产量大约相当于未灌水的土地的百分之一百六十。现在又灌田五十三万亩，将来可以发展到七十二万亩。
    卫河从前水量不定，平时一般木船只能装载五成到七成，特别是新乡到临清间，水浅河窄，枯水季节航运就要停顿。从黄河引水接济以后，就保证了卫河航运的通畅，一百吨的木船可以满载。将来改善卫河河道以后，还可以行驶载重二百吨的汽船。一九五二年九个月完成的货运总吨数为一九五一年全年的百分之一百四十六，一九五三年为一九五一年的百分之一百九十三。而一九五四年上半年的货运吨数即为一九五三年同期的百分之一百三十四。货运量正在迅速提高。若再配合卫河河道的整理，这个棉、麦、煤产区到海口间的运输将更为改善。
    人民胜利渠的成功，进一步说明人民的力量可以变害河为利河，可以使凶猛的黄水驯顺地为人民造福。但是，这不过是我们利用黄河为人民服务的开端；更壮丽的远景将随着国家工业化事业的发展逐步变成现实。据初步调查研究，利用黄河水可以发展大量的电力，可以灌溉千万亩农田，可以便利几千里的航运。黄河流域和它的附近还有着丰富的矿藏，有着肥沃广大的平原，有着发展工业和农业的优越条件和广阔前途。现在，成百成千的勘探人员分布在黄土高原、下游平原和干支流的深泽狭谷，正进行着查勘、测量、钻探，为黄河的治理搜集资料，为美好的将来进行准备。人民对于黄河
  “害必根除，利必尽兴”的要求，必然会在中国共产党和人民政府的领导以及全国人民的支援下逐步实现！
