The Soviet Union's sincere and selfless assistance to our country this time has further inspired the enthusiasm of Chinese youth in building the motherland. Chinese youth will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: be honest and diligent, and avoid any exaggeration and arrogance. They will work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in socialist construction, and take practical actions to thank the Soviet Union for its assistance to our country, to consolidate and develop the great Sino-Soviet friendship, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world.
