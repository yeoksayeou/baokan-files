    Krivoy Rog - The Iron Ore Region Center
    -- Visit to Ukraine, Part 10
    By Our Correspondent Li He

    In people's minds, Ukraine is a socialist republic of the Soviet Union, rich in resources. This is not only because its vast areas are covered with a thick layer of fertile black soil, making it one of the largest granaries in the Soviet Union. It is also because it possesses two huge underground treasures: Donbas (short for the Donets Coal Mining Region) and Krivbas (short for the Krivoy Rog Iron Ore Region).

    Krivbas is located on the right bank of the Dnieper River. We took a car from New Kakhovka to its center, Krivoy Rog. The car crossed the pontoon bridge from the left bank to the right bank, and then went north along the Ingulets River, a tributary of the Dnieper River. Along the way, combine harvesters were busy harvesting in the golden wheat fields. We passed the Novoraysk State Farm. Its 25,000 hectares of land yield about two million poods of grain annually, enough to load thirty trains. It is building a large club.

    Krivoy Rog is located in the upper reaches of the Ingulets River. It is a green city, shaped like a long belt, filled with brand-new houses, about twenty kilometers wide and seventy kilometers long. Because the city developed with the mining industry, the veins of Krivbas, the largest iron ore region in the Soviet Union, are concentrated here, in an area two to seven kilometers wide from east to west, and more than one hundred kilometers long from north to south.

    But in Krivoy Rog, if we didn't notice the iron tower-like mine hoists, the bridge-like ore dressing plants, and the rouge-like bright red earth, we really wouldn't feel like we were in the center of the iron ore region. Here, we strolled through one park after another, we went to one sports field after another, we saw one club after another. Each was better than the last. Everywhere, men and women were dressed beautifully, enjoying their rest and recreation to the fullest. There is a drama theater here, two cinemas, twenty-two clubs, twenty-two film projection venues, three cultural palaces, one hundred and fifty libraries, eleven parks, and many sports fields. In addition to the municipal ones, each mine has its own verdant park and its own well-equipped club. The "Dzerzhinsky" mine's park holds various cultural and recreational activities; in meeting the needs of the miners, it is no less than a municipal park. The "Rosa Luxemburg" mine's sports field is no smaller than the "Dynamo" sports field in Kiev, and its football team often goes out to compete. The "Bolshevik" mine spent six million rubles to build a miners' club in 1953. The club has four large halls for performances, reading, lectures, and sports, as well as fourteen rooms for recreational groups, and a children's room, billiard room, band room, and an open-air dance floor next to it. An open-air theater was also built in July, costing 500,000 rubles. I have never seen a city under the jurisdiction of a province with so many and such beautiful parks and cultural recreation places. This is entirely for the sake of caring for the miners. In a socialist society, the most valuable people are truly valued.

      To understand the work of the iron ore miners, we went down the mine. We went down to the "Giant" shaft of the "Dzerzhinsky" mine of the "Dzerzhinsky" Trust. There are two iron ore trusts in Krivoy Rog, which are under the leadership of the Soviet and Ukrainian Ministries of Steel Industry. Each trust has five or six mines, and each mine has several shafts. The "Giant" shaft is the largest in Europe, and its entire production process is almost completely mechanized. Accompanying us down the well were Protsenko, the chief engineer of the trust's technology section, and Zheng Delin and Sun Chengpu, staff members of the Anshan Gongchangling Iron Mine who were interning at this mine.

    We changed into the canvas clothing, underwear, and boots worn by the miners, wore the miners' insulated helmets, carried storage battery mine lamps, and took the shaft elevator down to the fourth level of the "Giant" shaft. The well is not very deep, about three or four hundred meters from the surface. The tunnels are very wide and paved with rails. In the faint light of the electric lights, the tunnels seemed more like quiet streets than large stone caves. At the sound of the bell, ore transport cars pulled by electric locomotives came and went. At a time, three cars each carrying five tons or two cars each carrying ten tons of ore are pushed into the tippler. The ore is tipped from the tippler into the receiving device on the lower level, and then lifted to the ground.

    Turning from the transport tunnel to the pedestrian path, we climbed two sections of iron ladders, as if climbing a cave, to reach the workplace of an iron ore miner. In a semi-height cave, driller Volvadol, wearing a mask, used a vertical pneumatic rock drill to drill holes in the top of the cave. The rock drill is like a slender column, with the arrow at the top relying on steam power to drill. After the holes are drilled, explosive workers set off explosives. The ground of this cave is empty, with wooden planks erected. After the explosion, the ore will fall to the lower level and be scraped onto the transport truck by a scraper. Volvadol has been working for three years and completing one and a half to two times his workload. We climbed down the iron ladder on the other side of the cave and saw the scraper, like an iron dustpan, which was pulled by a generator. Large pieces of ore are first crushed by workers with pneumatic picks to facilitate loading. We walked to a dead-end working face. Driller Tsavirov used a horizontal pneumatic rock drill to drill holes in the wall. This machine is slightly longer than a pneumatic pick, and automatically sprays water when drilling, so there is no ore dust, and workers do not wear masks. Tsavirov completes 170% to 180% of the monthly production plan. Due to the mechanization of the work, the labor is greatly reduced, and even women can participate in lighter work. Many of the drivers of electric locomotives and scrapers are women. Next to the scraper, we met the female driver Shavenka, a 23-year-old girl, who completed 140% of her work quota. Tsavirov is applying to join the Communist Party, and Shavenka is planning to have a good holiday. He and she both said:
  "I like my job."

    From the working face, we returned to the tunnel. We passed a medical station. The medical station occupies two rooms, has five medical officers on duty in rotation, and has oxygen equipment for 150 people. The medical station first provides emergency treatment to patients, and can send patients to the hospital on the ground within ten minutes. Each horizontal tunnel in the mine has two or three such medical stations. We also passed the dispatch room on the road, where there is an automatic telephone switchboard and communication with the drivers of each electric locomotive, even with the drivers of electric locomotives in motion. On the ground, there is also an automated dispatch console for the entire mine. The progress of each section of the mine every hour is recorded there. From there, one can talk to all places and direct all the work underground. The dispatcher is an engineer who has worked for many years.

    After staying underground for three hours, we returned to the surface. Our canvas miner's clothes had been dyed red. In the miners' bathroom, after taking off our "red suits" and showering, we, together with the miners who had changed into clean clothes, were exposed to the sunlight again, which seemed to become even brighter at this time.

    While in the underground tunnel, the miner gave me a piece of ore with an iron content of 62%. Krivoy Rog ore is famous for its rich iron content, containing 50% to 62% iron, sometimes reaching 70%. The iron ore here is transported to steel industrial centers along the Dnieper River, Donbas, and even the South Caucasus.

    The Krivbas mineral layer is buried not deep underground, so Krivoy Rog, in addition to many underground mines, is also developing many open-pit mines. We went to an open-pit mining site of the "Ilyich" mine. This is a low red mountain dug out of the flat ground. On the mountain, an excavator (electric shovel) was digging soil. A string of five-ton trucks received the red soil unloaded from the excavator's bucket like a stream, and transported them to the nearby open space. One bucket of soil filled one truck. Halfway up the mountain, an excavator was excavating waste rock. At the foot of the mountain, a drilling machine was drilling thirteen-meter-deep blast holes. Here, the top layer of twelve meters of soil is first excavated, and then the middle layer of about thirty to forty meters of waste rock is excavated, and the iron ore layer appears. In several cut sections, the dark red mineral layer is exposed. Some of the mineral layers can be excavated directly with excavators without drilling holes and blasting. Karlov, the director of the mining site, said: An excavator with 250 kilowatts of power in an open-pit mine is approximately equal to the production capacity of an underground mine, and open-pit mining is about half the cost of underground mining. We entered an ore dressing plant not far from the mining site, where water is used to wash the ore to increase its iron content. In this five-story factory building, only machines were seen in operation, and there were few workers.

    In the south of the city, we saw an even larger open-pit mining site. It is two kilometers long and 1,200 meters wide, and was only opened a year and a half ago. Eighteen excavators and many drilling machines were working. In three or four months, electric trains will be used as transportation tools here. Near the mining site, the building of a huge ore dressing plant was mostly completed, and the machines for washing ore and magnetic separation of ore are being installed. This mechanized ore dressing plant will increase the iron content of those ores that only contain 35-40% iron to 70%. Next to the ore dressing plant, the skeleton of a sintering plant has been built. Popov, the deputy manager of this joint enterprise, said that this mining site can be mined for more than one hundred years.

    Whether in underground mines or in open-pit mines, mining work is highly mechanized. This makes mining no longer inhumane labor, and this greatly increases the output of iron ore. The miners love their work, they love the fruits of their labor - the ore, they don't call the ore "Ruda" like most people, but "Ruchitska" (which means "good ore" or "lovely ore").

    Under highly mechanized conditions, outstanding workers are constantly growing up among the miners who love their profession. Shemi Volos is one of them. We went to the "Ilyich" mine office but didn't find this mine director who grew up from a driller, and only met him at the mine shaft. He had already changed into miner's clothing and was about to go down the well. We asked him to briefly talk about his life.

    Shemi Volos is forty-two years old this year. He started working as a hired hand for rich peasants at the age of ten. At the age of seventeen, he went to the iron ore mine and did odd jobs and other various tasks. At the age of twenty-one, he became a driller. He used his spare time to go to the library and attend technical training classes. During the pre-war Five-Year Plan period, Krivbas underwent technical transformation. His mine was also equipped with new machines. He often stayed in the mine after work to study them, looking for ways to increase production, and exchanging opinions with workers, foremen, and engineers. In 1940, he came up with a method of drilling multiple working faces: drilling more than fifteen working faces at the same time during each shift, instead of the usual two or three working faces. It was the day that Shemi Volos applied to join the Communist Party that he drilled eighteen working faces one day, completing 1,200% of the quota. His new mining method and his name spread throughout the Soviet Union. He won the Stalin Prize. This was before the war. After the Soviet army cleared the fascist bandits occupying Krivoy Rog in 1944, Shemi Volos became the mine director of the "Ilyich" mine. At that time, the mine was still flooded. Shemi Volos demonstrated strong organizational skills, enabling the mine to quickly resume production. After the war, he did a lot of work in developing the iron ore industry. He paid special attention to improving the level of mechanization of work, reducing product costs, and promoting advanced experience. He said: "The strength in the work lies in close contact with the masses of workers, and treating the workers as their own relatives. Listen to their voices." People who work well are respected in the Soviet Union. Shemi Volos was elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and is also a member of the municipal party committee.

    The labor of miners is more arduous than ordinary labor, so the compensation they receive is also relatively high. They have one month of vacation every year. Many miners overfulfill their production plans and earn three or four thousand rubles per month. The city's miners have one thousand private cars. We casually visited Pokryshkin Street. There are seventy families of miners living there, and there are four "Victory" brand and sixteen "Moskvich" brand cars. Not long ago, at a meeting convened by the Ukrainian Ministry of Steel Industry, workers proposed that there be a store selling cars in Krivoy Rog to avoid having money but no place to buy cars. This means that although many miners have bought cars, there are still many miners who want to buy cars. We strolled into the miners' residence of the "Giant" mine. The first floor is inhabited by three families. Driller Kliambesh, who had seven years of schooling and worked as a miner for ten years, earns more than 2,000 rubles a month. Section chief Kunitzky was originally a support worker, and after attending a six-month training class, he became a foreman, earning 1,900 rubles a month. Deputy section chief Baran, who worked as a miner for seven years, was also originally a support worker. After attending the training class, he also became a foreman, earning 1,400 rubles a month, with bonuses of more than 2,000 rubles. They are all married and each has one child. They each live in a suite (including two rooms and a kitchen and bathroom). Their rooms are relatively exquisitely equipped.

    With the development of iron ore mining and the improvement of the living standards of miners, Krivoy Rog, which has been transformed before the war and rebuilt after the war, is prospering day by day. There are steel plants, coking chemical plants, iron ore machine manufacturing plants, building materials plants, food factories, and so on. From 1946 to 1952, the city has built 400,000 square meters of housing, and new houses in entire villages and streets continue to appear last year and this year. The city (in 1953) has sixty-seven general schools, as well as mining technical schools, medical schools, music schools, mining colleges, educational colleges, and scientific research institutes.

    铁矿区中心克里沃·罗格
    ——乌克兰访问记之十
    本报记者  李何
    在人们心目中，乌克兰是苏联一个物产丰富的社会主义共和国。这不仅因为它的广阔地带铺盖着一层深厚肥沃的黑土，使它成为苏联最大的谷仓之一。这还因为它拥有两个巨大的地下宝藏：顿巴斯
  （顿内茨煤矿区的简称）和克里甫巴斯（克里沃·罗格铁矿区的简称）。
    克里甫巴斯在第聂伯河的右岸。我们从新卡霍夫卡乘汽车到它的中心——克里沃·罗格去。汽车由左岸越过浮桥到了右岸，然后沿着第聂伯河支流英古列茨河往北走。沿路金黄的麦地上，联合收割机忙着收割。我们经过诺沃拉伊斯克国营农场。它的二万五千公顷土地每年收获约两百万普特谷物，可以装载三十列火车。它正在建筑一座很大的俱乐部。
    克里沃·罗格位于英古列茨河的上游。它是一座长带似的布满崭新房屋的绿荫城市，宽约二十公里，长约七十公里。因为城市是随着矿业发展起来的，而苏联最大的铁矿区克里甫巴斯的矿脉，正是集中在这儿东西两公里到七公里，南北一百多公里的地带。
    但是在克里沃·罗格，如果不注意到铁塔似的耸立的矿井卷扬机，架着吊桥似的选矿厂，擦上胭脂似的鲜艳的红色土地，我们真不觉得到了铁矿区中心。在这里，我们逛了一处又一处公园，我们到了一座又一座运动场，我们看了一所又一所俱乐部。一个胜过一个。到处男男女女穿得漂漂亮亮，在尽情地休息和游玩。这里有一所话剧院，两所电影院，二十二所俱乐部，二十二所电影放映场，三所文化宫，一百五十所图书馆，十一座公园，许多运动场。除了市立的以外，每个矿都有自己林木苍翠的公园，都有自己设备周全的俱乐部。“捷尔任斯基”矿的公园举办各种文化娱乐活动；在满足矿工的需求上它不亚于一个市立公园。“罗沙·卢森堡”矿的运动场，不比基辅的“狄纳摩”运动场小，它的足球队经常出去比赛。“布尔什维克”矿花了六百万卢布在一九五三年建成矿工俱乐部。俱乐部有演出、阅览、讲演和运动四个大厅，还有十四个文娱小组用的房间，以及儿童室、弹子室、乐队室，旁边有露天跳舞场。七月间又盖了一座露天戏院，费用五十万卢布。我还没有见过一个州管辖的市有这样多和这样漂亮的公园和文化休息场所。这完全为了爱护矿工。在社会主义社会里，最宝贵的人真正地受到宝贵。
      为了认识铁矿工人的工作，我们下矿去。我们下到“捷尔任斯基”托拉斯的“捷尔任斯基”矿的
  “巨人”井。在克里沃·罗格有两个铁矿托拉斯，它们受苏联和乌克兰钢铁工业部的领导。每个托拉斯有五、六个矿，每个矿有几个井。“巨人”井是欧洲最大的，它的全部生产过程几乎都是机械化的。和我们一起下井的，有托拉斯技术科主任工程师普罗秦科，和在这个矿实习的鞍山弓长岭铁矿工作人员郑德林和孙承普。
    我们换上矿工穿的帆布衣裤、内衣内裤和靴子，戴着矿工的绝缘盔帽，提着蓄电池矿灯，乘了竖井的升降机，下到“巨人”井的第四段巷道去。井不很深，离地面大约三四百公尺。巷道很宽，铺着铁轨。在电灯的淡淡光线下，巷道与其说是像大石窑洞，不如说像僻静的街衢。铃声响处，来往着电车头拖的矿石运输车。一次推三车各五吨或两车各十吨的矿石进翻笼去。矿石从翻笼翻到下层承接的装置，然后提升到地上去。
    从运输巷道转到了行人小道，像爬山洞似地我们攀登了两节铁梯，到了一位铁矿工人工作的地方。在一个半人高的洞子里，打眼工沃尔瓦多尔戴着口罩，拿着垂直风动凿岩机，向洞顶凿眼。凿岩机像一根细长柱子，顶端的箭头依靠汽力凿动。打好眼后，由放炮工人放炸药爆炸。这个洞子的地面是空的，架着木板。爆炸后，矿石将陷落到下层，用刮矿机刮到运输车上。沃尔瓦多尔已经工作三年，完成着一倍半到两倍的工作。我们从洞子的另一边铁梯攀下，看到了用发电机绞拉的刮矿机，像一口铁簸箕。大块的矿石，先由工人用风镐打碎，以便于装载。我们走到了一个绝巷似的工作面。打眼工采维罗夫拿着水平风动凿岩机向壁面凿眼。这个机器比风镐稍长，在凿眼时自动喷水，所以没有矿末，工人也不带口罩。凿好眼后，也要放炸药爆炸。采维罗夫每月完成生产计划的百分之一百七、八十。由于工作机械化，劳动大大减轻，甚至妇女也有可能参加较轻的工作。像电车头和刮矿机的司机不少是由妇女担任的。在刮矿机旁边，我们遇见的女司机沙文卡，是二十三岁的姑娘，完成着工作定额的百分之一百四十。采维罗夫在申请加入共产党，沙文卡在计划很好度过休息日。他和她都说：
  “我喜欢自己的工作。”
    从工作面我们回到了巷道。路过一个医疗站。医疗站占两个房间，有五个医士轮流值班，有供一百五十人用的氧气装备。医疗站先对病人救急，十分钟内可以把病人送到地面上的医院去。矿井的每个水平巷道上设有两三个这样的医疗站。路上也经过调度室，那里有自动电话台和各电车头司机，甚至和行驶中的电车头司机通话。地面上还有全矿井的自动化的调度台。矿井各段每小时工作的进度，在那里都有记录。从那里，可以和各处通话，可以指挥地下的全部工作。调度员是一个工作多年的工程师。
    在地下逗留了三个钟头，我们又上到了地面。我们的帆布矿工服已经染成红色了。在矿工的浴室里，脱下了“红装”，淋浴以后，我们同换上一身洁净衣服的矿工们一起，又接触了阳光，这时候阳光变得似乎更加明亮了。
    在地下巷道时，矿工送给我一块含铁百分之六十二的矿石。克里沃·罗格矿石以含铁成分丰富而出名，它含铁百分之五十到六十二，有时达到百分之七十。这里的铁矿石运到第聂伯河沿岸、顿巴斯、以至南高加索的钢铁工业中心去。
    克里甫巴斯矿层埋在地下不深，所以克里沃·罗格除了许多地下矿以外，还发展着许多露天矿。我们到了“伊里奇”矿的一个露天采矿场。这是一座由平地掘成的不高的红山。山上，一台掘土机（电铲）在掘土。一串五吨大卡车流水似地承接着掘土机的掘斗卸下的红土，把它们运到附近的空地去。一斗土就装满一卡车。山腰，一台掘土机在掘掏废石。山下，钻孔机在钻打深十三公尺的炮眼。在这里，先掘去上面一层十二公尺的泥土，再掘去中间一层约三、四十公尺的废石，就出现了铁矿层。在几处切断面，暗红色的矿层露在外面。一部分矿层不用钻眼爆炸，直接用掘土机挖掘。矿场主任卡尔洛夫说：露天矿上一台二百五十瓩发电力的掘土机，约等于一座地下矿井的生产能力，露天开采比地下开采，要便宜约一半。我们进了离采矿场不远的一座选矿厂，那里用水洗矿石的方法提高矿石的含铁成份。在这五层厂房里，只见机器动作，没有几个工人。
    在城南我们看到了一座更大的露天采矿场。它长二公里，宽一千二百公尺，在一年半以前才开辟。十八台掘土机和许多凿眼机在工作着。三四个月后，这里将改用电气火车作运输工具。在采矿场附近，一座巨大的选矿厂的厂房大部盖好，开始安装水洗矿石和磁选矿石的机器。这个机械化的选矿厂将把那些只含铁百分之三十五—四十的矿石，提高到含铁百分之七十。在选矿厂旁边，一座烧结厂的骨架已经搭好。这个联合企业的副经理波波夫说，这个采矿场可以开采一百年以上。
    不论在地下矿井，不论在露天矿场，采矿工作都是高度机械化的。这使采矿不再是非人的劳动，这使铁矿的产量大大提高。矿工们喜爱自己的工作，喜爱自己劳动的果实——矿石，他们不像一般人们把矿石叫做“鲁达”，而叫做“鲁知茨卡”（它的意思就是“好矿石”或“可爱的矿石”）。
    在高度机械化的条件下，在爱好自己职业的矿工中，不断成长着出色的工人。薛米沃洛斯便是其中的一个。我们上“伊里奇”矿办公处没有访着这位由打眼工人成长的矿长，赶到了矿井边才见到了他。他已经换上矿工装束，快下井了。我们请他简短地谈了自己的生平。
    薛米沃洛斯今年四十二岁。他十岁起当富农的雇工。十七岁到铁矿，做过打杂和其他各种工作。二十一岁当了打眼工人。他利用了工余时间，进图书馆，上技术训练班。在战前五年计划时期，克里甫巴斯进行了技术改造。他的矿井也装置了新机器。他常常在下班以后，还留在矿井研究它们，寻找提高产量的办法，和工人、工长、工程师交换意见。一九四○年，他想出了多工作面凿眼方法：在每工作班时间中同时凿十五个以上工作面，而不是平常的两三个工作面。正是薛米沃洛斯申请加入共产党的日子，他有一天凿了十八个工作面，完成了定额的百分之一千二百。他的采矿新方法和他的名字传播到了全苏联。他获得了斯大林奖金。这是战前的事。一九四四年苏军肃清盘据克里沃·罗格的法西斯匪徒以后，薛米沃洛斯当了“伊里奇”矿矿长。当时矿井还淹着水。薛米沃洛斯表现了坚强的组织能力，使矿井迅速恢复了生产。战后在发展铁矿事业上他做了很多工作。他特别注意提高工作的机械化水平。降低产品成本和推广先进经验。他说：“工作中的力量在于和工人群众的密切联系，把工人看作自己亲人。倾听他们的呼声。”出色地劳动的人，在苏联是受尊敬的。薛米沃洛斯被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表，同时是市党委委员。
    矿工的劳动比一般的劳动辛苦，所以所得的报酬也比较高。他们每年休假一个月。很多矿工超额完成生产计划，每月收入三、四千卢布。全市矿工有一千辆自备的小汽车。我们随便访问了一条波克雷什金街。那里住着七十家矿工，就有自备的四辆“胜利”牌和十六辆“莫斯科人”牌的小汽车。不久前，乌克兰钢铁工业部召集的会议上，工人提出意见，希望在克里沃·罗格市有出售汽车的商店，免得有钱没处买汽车。这就是说，尽管许多矿工买到了汽车，还有许多矿工要买汽车。我们信步走进了“巨人”矿井的矿工住宅。第一层住着三家。打眼工人克连别什，念过七年书，做了十年矿工，每月工资二千多卢布。工段段长库尼茨基原来是支柱工人，上了六个月的训练班后，成为工长，每月工资一千九百卢布。工段副段长巴兰，当了七年矿工，原来也是支柱工人，上了训练班以后也成为工长，每月工资一千四百卢布，连奖金有二千多卢布。他们都娶了妻子，各有一个孩子。他们各住一个套间（包括两间住房和厨房、卫生间）。他们的房间的设备都比较精致。
    随着铁矿开采的发达和矿工生活水平的提高，经过战前改造和战后重建的克里沃·罗格，一天天繁荣起来。这里有钢铁厂、焦炭化学厂、铁矿机器制造厂、建筑材料厂、食品厂等等。从一九四六年到一九五二年，全市已经建筑四十万平方公尺住宅，去年和今年继续出现整村整街的新住宅。全市
  （在一九五三年）有六十七个普通学校，还有矿业技术学校、医士学校、音乐学校、矿业学院、教育学院、科学研究院。
