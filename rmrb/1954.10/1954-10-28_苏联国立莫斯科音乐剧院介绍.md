    The Moscow Musical Theatre is one of the most prestigious artistic groups in the Soviet Union. Its full name is associated with the surnames of two great People's Artists of the USSR - Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko. This is because the theatre was developed and merged from several artistic groups founded and nurtured by them; and it has consistently followed the realistic tradition and innovative spirit advocated by them.
    In the autumn of 1919, Stanislavsky founded the Youth Opera Studio in Moscow. Prior to this, conservative habits were very strong in most opera houses in the Soviet Union: the worship of "beautiful sound" replaced meaningful and substantial opera singing, neglecting the lines and content of opera characters, the direction and set design were conventional, and the stage was filled with a group of impersonal figures, turning opera into a costumed concert by one or several fashionable singers. Stanislavsky strongly opposed this trend, and his opera studio adopted a completely different artistic approach. He recruited a group of young and talented singers and worked with them for several years, integrating their vocal skills with vividly emotional acting.
    In November 1922, the opera studio held its first public performance, performing Tchaikovsky's opera "Eugene Onegin." The performers made this performance close to the true emotions that Tchaikovsky originally wanted to embody in the opera. For the first time, Soviet audiences heard an opera that was both simple and profound. This performance was a new stage in the development of Russian opera art and was highly praised by the Soviet music community.
    Stanislavsky's work was supported and valued by the Soviet state. Soon, this opera studio became a state opera house and was named the Stanislavsky Opera House. This young opera house worked independently for nearly twenty years and made many outstanding innovative performances.
    At the same time as Stanislavsky, another outstanding Russian dramatist, Nemirovich-Danchenko, also conducted research on the reform of musical theatre. In the summer of 1919, he founded the Music Theatre Studio attached to the Moscow Art Theatre. This studio was also composed of a group of young artists. The repertoire of this studio was clearly different from that of the Stanislavsky Opera Studio. It did not start with large-scale operas but with light classical operettas and comic operas. Nemirovich-Danchenko brought the art of operetta and comic opera closer to the demands of the revolutionary audience, eliminating the frivolous and flippant style and turning it into a kind of dramatically vivid and popular performance. He was also good at emphasizing the exposing and satirical tendencies in the performances, highlighting their social significance. This studio later developed into the State Musical Theatre led by Nemirovich-Danchenko.
    The creative work of Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko constituted the innovative line in the development of Soviet opera. In the 1920s and 1930s, the two theatres performed many new Soviet operas. Among them, "Quiet Flows the Don" by Dzerzhinsky and "The Storm" by Khrennikov, performed by the Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre, played a great role in the history of Soviet opera. "The Storm" was called the first true Soviet opera and a milestone in the history of Soviet opera art. The opera's performance depicted the struggle of poor peasants against counter-revolutionary bandits under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the meeting of peasant representatives with the great Lenin.
    The revolutionary era also put forward new tasks for ballet art, which was far from real life, and dancers also began to fight against stale formats and pursue realism. In 1933, the soloist of the Bolshoi Theatre, Viktorina Krieger, founded a new dance group called the Theatre of Dance Art. They began their performances with the ballet "The Rivals" composed by Gilte, giving ballet art a purposeful plot, vivid character and sharp social ideas.
    In 1939, the Theatre of Dance Art and the Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre merged. This enabled the young ballet group to begin fighting more effectively for true realism in ballet art.
    In June 1941, the Soviet people began the Great Patriotic War. In that year, according to the decision of the Soviet government, the Stanislavsky Opera House and the Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre were merged.
    In the first year of the war, the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre remained in Moscow, and the artists of the theatre went to the front lines almost every day to perform for the soldiers. When the fighting in the suburbs of Moscow was fierce, the theatre performed Vasilenko's ballet "Lola." The ballet was full of deep patriotic enthusiasm and depicted the struggle of the Spanish guerrillas against Napoleon's invasion. The performers of this ballet, Bulmeister and the dancer Sokolinskaya, won the Stalin Prize for this.
    After the victory of the Great Patriotic War, the Musical Theatre staged many new operas and ballets created by Soviet composers. Kabalevsky's new opera "The Taras Family" occupied an important position in the new repertoire, telling the story of the Russian people's struggle against fascism. The author, performers and participants of this play also won the Stalin Prize. The theatre also performed Ankay's opera "Lyubov Yarovaya" and Spartaki's ballet "The Coast of Happiness." The former reminded the Soviet people of many heroic deeds during the Civil War from 1918 to 1920, and the latter was the first Soviet ballet depicting the Great Patriotic War. In recent years, the theatre has also staged many new classical operas and ballets, as well as popular musical comedies created by classical composers of various Soviet nationalities. To celebrate the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia, the theatre staged the Ukrainian comic opera "Zaporozhets Beyond the Danube" composed by Gulak-Artemovsky. This comedy has penetrated into the life of the Ukrainian people and is welcomed everywhere in the Soviet Union. The classical ballet "Notre Dame de Paris" and the fairy tale ballet "Doctor Aibolit" are also successful new productions of the theatre in recent years. An important position in the theatre's ballet repertoire is occupied by Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake," which was newly staged last year. This ballet restored many musical passages that had been deleted in the past, revealing the profound thoughts of the original author.
    Thirteen years have passed since the merger of the two theatres. The Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre has always occupied an important position in the Moscow theatre community. It has a wide repertoire and has cultivated a group of young and outstanding artists. Many of the artists who have come to our country for a performance tour this time have won the honorary titles of People's Artist or Honored Artist of Russia and other republics.

    苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院介绍
    莫斯科音乐剧院是苏联最负有盛誉的艺术团体之一。它的全称冠以苏联两个伟大的人民艺术家的姓氏——斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科。因为剧院是由他们所创办培育的几个艺术团体发展合并而成的；并且一贯遵循着他们所倡导的现实主义传统和革新精神。
    一九一九年秋，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基在莫斯科创办了青年歌剧研究班。在这以前，苏联国内大多数歌剧院里保守习气非常浓厚：对“美音”的崇拜代替了富有意义和内容的歌剧演唱，轻视台词和歌剧形象的内容，导演和布景装置都是陈规旧套，舞台出现的是一堆毫无个性的人物，歌剧成了一位或几位时髦歌手的化装音乐会。斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基强烈地反对这种倾向，他的歌剧研究班采取了完全不同的艺术方针，他招收了一批年轻而有才能的歌手，和他们在一起工作了几年，使他们的声乐技巧同有鲜明感情的演技融合在一起。
    一九二二年十一月这个歌剧研究班举行第一次公演，演出了柴可夫斯基的歌剧“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”，演出者使这次演出接近了柴可夫斯基原来要在歌剧中体现的真实感情。苏联观众第一次听到了既朴实而又意味深长的歌剧。这次演出是俄罗斯歌剧艺术上的一个新的发展阶段，苏联音乐界曾给予崇高的评价。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的工作受到苏维埃国家的支持和重视，不久这个歌剧研究班就成为国立歌剧院，并被命名为斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基歌剧院。这个年轻的歌剧院独立地工作了近二十年，作了不少出色的革新演出。
    和斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基同时，另一位卓越的俄罗斯戏剧家——聂米罗维奇—丹钦科，对音乐剧的改革也进行了研究。一九一九年夏天，他创办了莫斯科艺术剧院附属的乐剧研究班。这个研究班也是由一些年轻的艺术家组成的。这个研究班的剧目显然和斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基歌剧研究班的剧目不同，它不是从大型的歌剧着手，而是从轻便的古典轻歌剧和喜歌剧着手的。聂米罗维奇—丹钦科使轻歌剧和喜歌剧艺术接近于革命观众的要求，消除掉其中的轻嘴薄舌的恶劣作风，把它变成一种有鲜明戏剧性的大众化的表演。他并善于在演出中强调揭发性的、讽刺性的倾向，突出地强调其社会意义。这个研究班后来发展成为由聂米罗维奇—丹钦科领导的国立音乐剧院。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科创造性的工作，就构成了苏联歌剧发展上的革新路线。在二十和三十年代里，两个剧院演出了许多新的苏联歌剧。其中聂米罗维奇—丹钦科剧院所演出的捷尔仁斯基的“静静的顿河”、赫连尼科夫的“暴风雨”在苏联歌剧史上起了极大的作用。“暴风雨”被称为第一个真正的苏维埃歌剧和苏联歌剧艺术史的里程碑。歌剧的演出表现了贫农在共产党的领导下对反革命匪帮的叛乱所作的斗争，和农民代表同伟大的列宁的见面。
    革命的时代也向远离现实生活的舞剧艺术提出了新的任务，舞蹈家们也开始了反对陈腐格式，追求现实主义的斗争。一九三三年，大剧院的独舞家维克托琳娜·克里艾勒创办了一个新的舞蹈团体，名叫舞蹈艺术剧院。他们以吉尔特作曲的舞剧“敌手”开始了自己的演出，使舞剧艺术具有目的性的剧情，鲜明的人物性格和尖锐的社会思想。
    一九三九年舞蹈艺术剧院和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院合并。这使年轻的舞剧团体开始更有效地为舞剧艺术中真正的现实主义而斗争。
    一九四一年六月，苏联人民开始了伟大的卫国战争。在这一年，根据苏联政府的决定，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基歌剧院同聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院宣告合并。
    战争的第一年，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基与聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院仍留在莫斯科，剧院的艺术家们几乎每天都到前线为战士们演出。在莫斯科城郊战斗激烈的时候，剧院演出了瓦西连柯的舞剧“罗拉”。舞剧充满了深刻的爱国主义热情，表现了西班牙游击队为反抗拿破仑侵略所作的斗争。这个舞剧的演出者布尔梅斯杰尔和舞蹈家索珂琳娜娅曾因此获得了斯大林奖金。
    伟大卫国战争胜利结束后，音乐剧院上演了许多由苏联作曲家创作的新歌剧和新舞剧。卡巴列夫斯基的新歌剧“塔拉斯的一家”在新剧目里占重要的地位，它叙述了俄罗斯人民反法西斯的斗争。这个戏的作者、演出者和参加者也荣获了斯大林奖金。剧院还演出安凯的歌剧“柳波夫·雅罗瓦娅”，司巴达维基的舞剧“幸福之岸”。前者使苏联人民重新记起一九一八到一九二○年内战时期的许多英雄事迹，后者是第一部描写伟大卫国战争的苏联舞剧。剧院近年来还新上演了许多古典歌剧和舞剧，也演出了苏联各民族古典作曲家创作的通俗音乐喜剧。为庆祝乌克兰和俄罗斯重新合并三百周年，剧院上演了库拉克—阿尔捷莫夫斯基作曲的乌克兰喜歌剧“多瑙河彼岸的萨坡罗什人”。这部喜剧已深入乌克兰人民生活，在苏联到处受到欢迎。古典舞剧“巴黎圣母院”、童话舞剧“阿伊波利特医生”也是剧院近年来成功的新演出。在剧院舞剧剧目占重要地位的是去年新上演的柴可夫斯基的“天鹅湖”。这个舞剧恢复了许多过去被删掉的音乐篇章，使原作者的深刻思想表露无遗。
    从两个剧院合并到现在，已经过了十三年。斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院在莫斯科戏剧界一直占有重要的地位。它拥有广泛的剧目；培养出了一批年轻的、卓越的艺术家，这次来我国访问演出的艺术家中，有很多人曾获得俄罗斯和其他共和国的人民演员或功勋演员的光荣称号。　（新华社）
