Rehe Province has achieved results in promoting new agricultural implements. According to statistics, the province has promoted more than 10,000 small combined shovel machines, more than 7,600 wave-type unwheeled single-blade plows, more than 14,000 7-inch walking plows, more than 100 sets of complete new-style animal-powered agricultural implements, and a large number of other new agricultural implements. This year, it will continue to promote 10,000 7-inch walking plows and 400 double-wheel double-blade plows and nail-tooth harrows. In order to do this work well, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a special meeting on agricultural implements in September. Various counties and banners also held training classes for new agricultural implement technicians. According to statistics from eight counties and banners including Lingyuan and Beipiao, more than 1,500 farmer technicians have been trained. At present, farmers are busily using new agricultural implements for plowing and harrowing.

    热河省积极推广新式农具
    热河省推广新农具工作已获得成绩。据统计全省已推广了一万多台小型综合号铲?机、七千六百多部波式无轮一铧犁、一万四千多部七吋步犁，一百多套全套的新式畜力农具及其他大批新农具。今年还继续推广一万部七吋步犁和四百部双轮双铧犁和钉齿耙。为了做好这个工作，省农业厅和省供销合作总社在九月份曾召开了农具专门会议，各县旗也举办了新农具技术手训练班，据凌源、北票等八个县旗统计已训练了农民技术手一千五百多人。目前，农民正紧张用新式农具耕地、耙地。
