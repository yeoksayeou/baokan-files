The newspaper "Pravda" today published the documents exchanged between the Soviet government and the American government during the negotiations on atomic energy issues.

As everyone knows, the Soviet government has consistently pursued a policy of peace and has repeatedly proposed to the United Nations that an international convention be concluded stipulating the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, a substantial reduction in conventional armaments, and the establishment of effective supervision to ensure compliance with these agreements. The Soviet government's proposals stem from the fact that they meet the increasingly strong demands of the peoples of all countries to stop the arms race, including atomic and hydrogen weapons, and to take immediate measures to save humanity from the danger of a devastating atomic war.

Contrary to what the United States said in its memorandum of July 9, it is not the Soviet Union, but the United States government, that has until now obstructed the conclusion of the above-mentioned agreement under conditions acceptable to all equal and sovereign states.

However, although an agreement has not yet been reached, the efforts of the countries concerned to reach the necessary agreement have not diminished in significance. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet government expressed its willingness to participate in secret or diplomatic negotiations to discuss President Eisenhower's suggestion of December 8, 1953, regarding the international peaceful application of atomic energy.

The Soviet government pointed out that the realization of this suggestion (stipulating that the countries concerned each contribute a portion of their stored atomic raw materials to an international agency for processing for peaceful purposes) would not stop the expansion of armaments. Therefore, the Soviet government made new efforts to seek a way out of the current situation. During the negotiations, the Soviet government suggested simultaneously discussing the Soviet proposal, that the countries participating in the agreement, in the spirit of easing international tensions, solemnly and unconditionally assume the responsibility of not using atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

The Soviet government emphasized that reaching an international agreement on this issue would be a major step, which would make it possible to gradually and completely eliminate atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction from the armaments of all countries, and to establish strict international supervision to ensure the execution of the agreement prohibiting the use of atomic energy for war purposes.

However, the documents published today show that the United States government has adopted a negative attitude toward this Soviet proposal. It can be seen from these documents that the United States government is trying to justify its negative attitude with unfounded arguments, for example, it says that it cannot believe that an agreement on the unconditional non-use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons by all countries will be fulfilled. But, if the question is posed in this way, then doubts can be expressed about any international treaty!

The published documents illustrate that, at the current stage of the Soviet-American negotiations, the attitudes of the two sides have not yet reached agreement on many major issues. In the course of the negotiations, the Soviet government believed and continues to believe that the international agreement concluded must guarantee the prohibition of the use of atomic energy for military purposes, and that atomic energy should be used only for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of mankind. As everyone knows, the Soviet scientific community is dedicated to using atomic energy for peaceful purposes and has achieved remarkable success. The Soviet Union's first atomic energy power station in the world has begun supplying electricity.

On the other hand, everyone also knows that the United States government has also declared that it is dedicated to promoting the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Given that the agreement of the Soviet Union and the United States on this issue is of great significance for reaching an international agreement on the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, the Soviet government believes that it is best for both governments to continue their efforts to bring their attitudes closer. The possibility of reaching agreement between the two sides cannot be considered exhausted.

In its memorandum of September 22, the Soviet government reminded the United States government of some important principles that cannot be ignored when studying the issue of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

An extremely important prerequisite for international cooperation in this area is that everyone recognizes that such agreements must in no way give any country or group of countries a special status, nor allow that country or group of countries to impose its will on other countries.

Any international agency established under appropriate agreements between countries, if it is to successfully fulfill its responsibilities, must, on the one hand, have sufficiently broad powers to effectively complete the tasks entrusted to it, but on the other hand, its powers must not be used to jeopardize the security of any country. Only when its powers and tasks and its actual activities conform to the universally recognized principles of the United Nations Charter can it fulfill its mission.

The Soviet government agrees with the United States government on one point: that the international agency should report on its work to the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly. Naturally, if issues affecting the security of certain countries arise in this matter, the Security Council should take the necessary decisions in accordance with its responsibility as an agency primarily responsible for maintaining peace and international security.

The urgency of these principles is very clear, because we all remember the many messages that have recently appeared in the American newspapers, talking about the intention of the American ruling group to establish some kind of "atomic common storage," many American newspapers wrote that this is some kind of "Marshall Plan in atomic terms," which is not under the supervision of the United Nations.

Regarding the plan to establish such a "common storage," Hightower, a commentator for the American news agency Associated Press, wrote not long ago, "This agency will operate outside the United Nations, otherwise Communist treachery may hinder (?! ) its work." Needless to say, plans of this kind cannot help to solve the problem of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

As stated in the memorandum of September 22, "The Soviet government notes the statement by the United States government that it is ready to resume negotiations on the peaceful use of atomic energy at any time, and the Soviet government, for its part, expresses its readiness to continue such negotiations to study the proposals of the Soviet government and the United States government."

In view of this statement, one cannot but be surprised by the remarks made by US representative Lodge at the meeting of the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on September 24, when he insisted that the Soviet Union refused to participate in the plan to establish an international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy. In response to this unfounded claim, Soviet representative Vyshinsky justly said that Lodge's claim that the Soviet Union refused to cooperate in the establishment of an international atomic agency was not in accordance with the actual situation.

The Soviet government suggested on September 22 that all documents on Soviet-American negotiations on atomic energy be published in newspapers in order to allow public opinion to understand the progress of the negotiations. It was pointed out that the reason for publishing all diplomatic exchanges on atomic energy negotiations was due to the appearance of inaccurate reports in the newspapers regarding the propositions of both sides. For example, as everyone knows, some American newspapers have more than once attempted to distort the Soviet Union's propositions on the issue of atomic energy in order to deceive American public opinion. The publication of the documents may put an end to various inaccurate reports on this important issue, because this issue concerns not only the interests of the Soviet and American peoples, but also the interests of the peoples of all countries.

The Soviet Union is unremittingly fighting for the cause of peace and world security, and consistently advocates that the solution to the atomic problem must prevent the threat of atomic war and provide broad possibilities for not using atomic energy for destruction, but for creation and human progress.

    苏美关于原子能问题的谈判
    ——“真理报”九月二十六日社论
    今天“真理报”刊载了苏联政府和美国政府在谈判原子能问题的过程中互相交换的文件。
    大家知道，苏联政府始终不渝地奉行和平政策，不止一次地向联合国建议缔结一项国际公约，规定无条件禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，大量裁减常规军备，并为使这些协定得到遵守而建立有效的监督。苏联政府提出这些建议的出发点是，这些建议符合各国人民日益强烈的要求：停止扩充军备，其中包括原子武器和氢武器，采取刻不容缓的措施使人类免遭毁灭性的原子战争的危险。
    事实和美国七月九日提出的备忘录中所说的相反，不是苏联，而是美国政府直到现在一直阻挠着在能为一切平等的主权国家所接受的条件下缔结上述协定。
    但是，尽管直到现在还未能达成协议，有关国家之间为达成必需的协议而努力仍然没有减少其意义。正因为如此，苏联政府表示了愿意参加秘密的或外交的谈判，来讨论艾森豪威尔总统一九五三年十二月八日提出的、关于原子能的国际和平应用的建议。
    苏联政府指出，这个建议（规定有关国家各拿出自己所储藏的一部分原子原料交给国际机构处理以用于和平目的）的实现，不会使扩充军备的情况停止。因此苏联政府作了新的努力，谋求现在状况的出路。苏联政府在谈判过程中建议同时讨论苏联的建议，即参加协议的国家本着缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，庄严地和无条件地担负起不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的责任。
    苏联政府着重指出，就这个问题取得国际协议将是一个重大的步骤，这样就可能逐步地在各国军备中完全取消原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器，并建立严格的国际监督以保证禁止将原子能用于战争目的这一协议的执行。
    但是，今天所公布的文件表明，美国政府对苏联这个建议采取了否定的态度。从这些文件中可以看出，美国政府力图以毫无根据的论点来为自己的否定态度辩护，例如它说，它不能相信关于各国无条件地不使用原子武器和氢武器的协议会得到履行。但是，如果问题是这样提法，那么对任何一个国际条约都可以表示怀疑了！
    公布的文件说明，在苏美谈判的现阶段中，双方在许多重大问题上的态度还未能取得一致。在谈判过程中，苏联政府认为并继续认为，所缔结的国际协议必须能保证禁止将原子能用于军事目的，并使原子能只用于和平的用途，为人类造福。大家知道，苏联科学界正致力将原子能用于和平目的，并已获得了卓越的成就。苏联的世界第一个原子能电力站已开始供电了。
    另一方面，大家也知道，美国政府也声明，它致力促使原子能用于和平目的。
    鉴于苏联和美国就这个问题的态度取得一致对达成关于原子能用于和平目的的国际协议具有重要意义，苏联政府认为，双方政府最好能继续努力，以期双方的态度得以接近。使双方态度取得一致的可能性不能认为都已殆尽了。
    在九月二十二日的备忘录里，苏联政府提醒美国政府注意在研究和平使用原子能方面的国际合作问题时不能忽视的一些重要原则。
    这方面的国际合作有一个极重要的先决条件，那就是大家承认这样的协定无论如何不能使任何国家和国家集团取得特殊地位，不能使这个国家和国家集团能够把自己的意志强加在其他国家身上。
    根据国家之间的适当协定所建立的任何国际机构，如果要能顺利地履行自己的职责，一方面固然必须要有足够广泛的职权，使它能有效地完成受委托的任务，但另一方面它的职权却不得被用来损害任何国家的安全。只有它的职权和任务以及它的实际活动符合众所公认的联合国宪章原则，它才能完成自己的使命。
    苏联政府同意美国政府一点意见：这个国际机构应向安全理事会和联合国大会报告工作情况。自然，如果在这件事情上发生了影响到某些国家的安全的问题，应该由安全理事会按照它作为一个对维持和平和国际安全负有首要责任的机构的职责，采取必要的决定。
    这些原则的迫切性是十分明显的，因为我们都记得最近美国报纸上出现了许多消息，谈到美国统治集团打算建立某种“原子共储”这回事，美国许多报纸写道，这乃是某种“原子方面的马歇尔计划”之类的东西，它不处在联合国的监督之下。
    关于建立这样的“共储”的计划，美国通讯社美联社的评论员海托华不久前写道，“这个机构将在联合国之外行动，否则共产党的奸计就可能妨害（？！）它的工作。”不必说，这一类计划绝对不能有助于解决将原子能使用于和平目的的问题。
    正如九月二十二日的备忘录中所说的，“苏联政府注意到美国政府声明准备在任何时候恢复关于和平使用原子能问题的谈判，苏联政府在自己这方面，表示准备继续举行这种谈判，来研究苏联政府的和美国政府的建议”。
    从这个声明看来，美国代表洛奇九月二十四日在联合国大会总务委员会会议上的发言中硬说苏联拒绝参加建立和平使用原子能国际机构的计划，就不能不引起人们的惊奇。苏联代表维辛斯基在答复这个毫无根据的说法时公正地说：洛奇说苏联拒绝在建立国际原子机构问题上进行合作，那是不符合实际情况的。
    苏联政府九月二十二日建议在报纸上公开发表关于苏美两国就原子能问题进行谈判的一切文件，为的是让舆论界了解谈判的情况。据指出，所以要公布关于原子能谈判的一切外交往来文件，是由于报纸上出现了对于双方主张的不确实的报道。例如，大家知道：美国某些报纸不止一次地企图歪曲苏联对于原子能问题的主张，以图欺骗美国的舆论。文件的公布可能终止对于这个重要的问题的各种不正确的报道，因为这个问题不仅有关苏联和美国人民的利益，而且有关世界各国人民的利益。
    苏联不懈地为着和平和世界安全的事业而斗争，一贯地主张原子问题的解决办法必须能防止原子战争的威胁，并为不把原子能用于破坏、而用于创造和人类进步提供广泛的可能性。
