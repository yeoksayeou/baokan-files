Xinhua News Agency, October 10th:

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai cabled the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 10th, denouncing the United States' armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan. The text of the cable is as follows: To Mr. Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations, New York, and to Dr. van Kleffens, President of the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly:

Regarding the issue of the United States of America's armed aggression against the Chinese territory of Taiwan, the Government of the People's Republic of China previously submitted a complaint to Mr. Malik, President of the United Nations Security Council, in a cable dated August 24, 1950. During the Security Council's discussion of the "Complaint of Armed Aggression Against Taiwan," Mr. Wu Xiuquan, a specially appointed representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China, attended the meeting on November 28, 1950, to present his views. He confirmed the crime of the United States government's armed aggression against Taiwan based on various undeniable facts. Due to the obstruction of the United States, the Security Council has been unable to take effective measures based on the principles of the United Nations Charter to maintain international peace and security. The "Complaint of Armed Aggression Against Taiwan" remains on the Security Council's agenda and has not been resolved.

In order to safeguard international peace and security, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics submitted a complaint to the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 20, 1950, regarding the United States' aggression against China. When presenting his views on this complaint at the meeting of the Political and Security Committee of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on November 27, 1950, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky suggested that the General Assembly request the Security Council to take necessary actions to immediately stop the United States' aggression against China. Also due to the obstruction of the United States, the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly did not request the Security Council to take necessary and effective measures, but allowed the United States' aggression against China to continue and develop, thus posing an increasingly serious threat to the security of the People's Republic of China and the peace of Asia and the world.

It is known to all that Taiwan is Chinese territory. The "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," which the United States government participated in signing, both acknowledged that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China. In fact, Taiwan was taken over by the then Chinese government on October 25, 1945.

After Taiwan's return to China, the United States government repeatedly stated and guaranteed that it would respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and would not interfere in the situation in Taiwan with armed forces. On January 5, 1950, former U.S. President Truman issued a statement on the Taiwan issue, saying: "The United States has no predatory ambitions with respect to Taiwan or any other Chinese territory. Nor does it have any intention of acquiring special rights or privileges or establishing military bases on Taiwan. Nor does it contemplate using its armed forces to interfere in the present situation. The U.S. Government will not pursue a course which would lead to involvement in the civil conflict in China. Similarly, the U.S. Government will not provide military aid or advice to Chinese forces on Taiwan." On February 9, 1950, the U.S. State Department submitted a document on the Taiwan issue to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. In this document, the U.S. government stated:

"If the United States Government were to attempt to establish a non-Chinese administration in Taiwan through the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, through the United Nations, or through a plebiscite conducted by the Far Eastern Commission, this would be interpreted almost universally in mainland China and widely in Asia as a violation by this Government of its assurances, and a departure from our long-standing policy of respecting China's territorial integrity, and an attempt to detach Taiwan from China." These two citations are sufficient to show that the United States government has long recognized that not interfering in the Taiwan situation with armed forces is an unshakable obligation of the United States or any other foreign or international organization. Violating this obligation would be interfering in China's internal affairs and undermining China's territorial integrity, which would be a violation of the basic principles of the United Nations.

However, the United States government has not abided by its own promises and the obligations established by various international agreements. When they saw that the possibility of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique re-enslaving the Chinese people was completely hopeless, they began to carry out armed intervention and threats of war against China from three main directions: Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina. On June 27, 1950, former U.S. President Truman issued a statement announcing the dispatch of armed forces to invade Korea, while invading Chinese territory Taiwan and intensifying interference in the Indochina War. Since then, the United States government's various armed aggression activities against Taiwan have intensified day by day. Especially after the cessation of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the gradual easing of international tensions made the U.S. ruling clique, which feared peace, deeply uneasy. Therefore, they intensified their use of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, who had fled to Taiwan, to carry out harassing and destructive warfare against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas, in an attempt to expand their aggression against China and create new tensions in Asia.

Now, I am authorized to represent the Government of the People's Republic of China to bring the relevant facts of the United States government's armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan to the most serious attention of the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly:

	1.	Since the U.S. Seventh Fleet invaded the Taiwan Strait in June 1950, China's Taiwan Province has fallen under the direct military control of the United States. The U.S. fleet has been conducting so-called patrols and reconnaissance in the seas close to China, including from Shantou in Guangdong Province in the south to Qingdao in Shandong Province in the north, and has occupied the ports of Kaohsiung and Keelung in Taiwan and Makung Port in the Penghu Islands as naval bases. In August 1950, the Thirteenth Air Force, subordinate to the U.S. Far East Air Force Command, invaded Taiwan and established a so-called "Taiwan Forward Command Post." For more than four years, the aircraft fleets of the Thirteenth and Twentieth Air Forces, subordinate to the U.S. Far East Air Force Command, have been constantly flying to Taiwan for activities, and have occupied Tainan, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Chiayi, Songshan, Taichung, and Makung Port in the Penghu Islands in Taiwan as air force bases. In this way, the United States has not only invaded Chinese territory Taiwan, but has also turned Taiwan into a base for preparing to expand its aggression against the People's Republic of China.
	2.	In order to expand its aggression against China, the United States government has been intensifying the training of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's army. The "Military Assistance Advisory Group" stationed in Taiwan by the United States government is constantly reorganizing, equipping, and training the army, navy, and air force of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The various weapons of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, including guns, cannons, ammunition, tanks, airplanes, and warships, are entirely supplied by the United States government. After the failure of the U.S. government's conspiracy to obstruct the ceasefire in Indochina, the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group," in order to cooperate with the U.S. government's policy of creating new tensions, re-defined the training policy for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's army, which is to strengthen offensive training, with particular emphasis on amphibious operations training. According to recent news reports, the U.S. government is also preparing to form a "U.S. Joint Military Headquarters" in Taiwan in the next two or three months, including the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Taiwan, in order to directly control the army of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
	3.	In order to use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to expand its aggression against China, the United States government has also provided the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with huge amounts of military and economic assistance funds. According to existing materials, from July 1950 to June 1954, these funds totaled approximately more than 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, which has become the main financial source for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to wage war.
	4.	Under the instigation and support of the United States government, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has been carrying out harassing and destructive warfare against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas. Over the years, this traitorous clique has continuously attacked the coastal areas and islands of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces in China, bombed Chinese coastal cities, massacred Chinese people, and sent special agents by sea or airdropped them by plane to the Chinese mainland to carry out assassination work. Recently, in order to implement the U.S. policy of expanding aggression against China, this traitorous clique has not only intensified the above-mentioned destructive activities, but has also clamored for counter-attacking the mainland, attempting to turn the whole of China into a U.S. colony.
	5.	In order to blockade the People's Republic of China and obstruct trade between China and other countries, the United States government has been assisting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in robbing and detaining Chinese ships and ships from various countries coming to China for trade. According to incomplete statistics, over the past few years, more than 470 Chinese ships and more than 67 foreign ships have been victimized, including ships belonging to the Soviet Union, Poland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, Panama, Greece, West Germany, and other countries, with the United Kingdom having the most. Some of these ships were hijacked and detained, some were sunk, some were attacked, and some were robbed. These piratical acts carried out by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique under the instigation of the United States government have violently undermined the principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas.
	6.	In order to support the war activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the United States government has directly sent its military aircraft to invade Chinese airspace to carry out demonstrations and provocations, causing heavy losses to the lives and property of the Chinese people. The United States government has also sent military aircraft to invade Chinese airspace for strategic reconnaissance, and airdropped spies to carry out sabotage activities. On July 26, 1954, U.S. military aircraft shot down two Chinese aircraft over Hainan Island in China. Recently, the U.S. government has blatantly clamored that it will interfere with the just cause of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan with armed forces. These all prove that the U.S. government is deliberately trying to expand its armed intervention against China.
	7.	It should also be pointed out that after the cessation of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the U.S. government, unwilling to accept the failure of its aggressive policy in Asia, has taken measures to expand the scope of aggression. In September 1954, the United States gathered eight countries in Manila to hold a meeting and organized a Southeast Asia military bloc with the People's Republic of China as its main target. The U.S. government is also attempting to piece together Japanese reactionary forces, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to organize a so-called "Northeast Asia Defense Alliance." At the same time, the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are conducting negotiations and actively planning to conclude a so-called "Bilateral Treaty of Common Security." The U.S. government is clearly attempting to form an encirclement of the People's Republic of China, with Taiwan as its hub, through this series of measures, and to carry out new military adventures.

All the above facts fully prove that the U.S. government's continued occupation of Taiwan, sheltering of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and obstruction of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan are not only an infringement on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, an interference in China's internal affairs, and a preparation for expanding aggression against China, but also an increase in the threat of war in the Far East and a tension of the international situation. The U.S. government's policy of aggression and war, and its continued obstruction of the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status and rights in the United Nations, are all completely incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.

Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, and it will never be allowed for the United States to occupy it, nor will anyone be allowed to detach Taiwan from China in the name of so-called "neutralization" and "placing it under United Nations trusteeship." The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and no other country is allowed to interfere. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is not only to safeguard China's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, but also to defend the peace and security of Asia and the world. The Chinese people's just act of liberating Taiwan is fully in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, which respects national rights, while any act of interfering with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan violates Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that the United Nations and its member states shall not infringe on the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or country, nor shall they interfere in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any country.

In order to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in order to defend international peace and security, and in order to uphold the dignity of the United Nations Charter, I now, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, re-submit the complaint against the United States' armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan to the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly should assume its unshirkable responsibility to urge the Security Council to stop the U.S. government's aggression aimed at interfering with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and to order the U.S. government to completely withdraw all U.S. armed forces and all military personnel from Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other islands belonging to China.

Mr. Secretary-General, I request you to distribute the full text of this complaint cable to the delegations of all countries except the Kuomintang delegation of Chiang Kai-shek at the United Nations General Assembly.

Respectfully submitted, for your consideration.

Zhou Enlai
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

    周恩来外长致电联合国大会第九届会议
    控诉美国武装侵略我国领土台湾
    【新华社十日讯】中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来于十月十日致电联合国大会第九届会议，控诉美国武装侵略中国领土台湾。电文如下：纽约联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生并转联合国大会第九届会议主席范·克里芬斯博士：
    关于美利坚合众国武装侵略中国领土台湾的问题，前经中华人民共和国政府于一九五零年八月二十四日致电联合国安全理事会主席马立克先生提出控诉。在安全理事会讨论“控诉武装侵略台湾案”的过程中，中华人民共和国政府特派代表伍修权先生曾于一九五零年十一月二十八日出席陈述意见，并根据各种无可否认的事实，证实了美国政府武装侵略台湾的罪行。由于美国的阻挠，安全理事会没有能够根据联合国宪章维持国际和平和安全的原则采取有效的措施，至今“控诉武装侵略台湾案”仍然留在安全理事会的议程上，未获解决。
    为了保障国际和平和安全，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府曾于一九五零年九月二十日向联合国大会第五届会议提出了关于美国侵略中国的控诉案。苏联代表维辛斯基先生于一九五零年十一月二十七日在联合国大会第五届会议政治和安全委员会会议上就这一控诉案陈述意见时，曾建议大会要求安全理事会采取必要的行动来立刻停止美国对中国的侵略。同样由于美国的阻挠，联合国大会第五届会议也没有要求安全理事会采取必要的有效的措施，而听任美国侵略中国的局势继续存在和发展，以致对中华人民共和国的安全和亚洲及世界的和平造成了日益严重的威胁。
    举世皆知，台湾是中国的领土。美国政府参加签定的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”都承认台湾和澎湖列岛应该归还中国。事实上，台湾已于一九四五年十月二十五日由当时的中国政府接管。
    台湾归还中国后，美国政府又曾一再声明保证尊重中国的主权和领土完整，而不以武装力量干涉台湾的局势。一九五零年一月五日，美国前任总统杜鲁门发表了一项关于台湾问题的声明说：“美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺的野心。现在美国无意在台湾获取特别权利或者特权或者建立军事基地。美国亦不拟使用武装部队干预目前的局势。美国政府不拟遵循任何足以把美国卷入中国内争的途径。同样地，美国政府也不拟对在台湾的中国军队提供军事的援助或意见。”一九五零年二月九日，美国国务院又曾就台湾问题向美国众议院外交委员会提出了一项文件。在这一文件中，美国政府声明：
  “如果美国政府希图通过驻日盟军总部、通过联合国、或者通过远东委员会所主持的公民投票在台湾建立一个非中国的行政当局，这就会在中国大陆上几乎普遍地解释为和在亚洲广泛地解释为本政府违背了它的保证，并背弃我们一向尊重中国领土完整的长期政策，而企图使台湾脱离中国。”这两项引证足够说明美国政府早已承认，不以武装力量干涉台湾局势乃是美国或其他任何外国或国际组织的不可动摇的义务，违背这个义务就是干涉中国内政和破坏中国领土完整，就是违背联合国的基本原则。
    但是，美国政府并没有遵守自己的诺言和各种国际协议所确定的义务。当他们看到了蒋介石卖国集团重新奴役中国人民的可能性已经完全绝望的时候，他们就着手从台湾、朝鲜、印度支那三个主要方向，来进行对中国的武装干涉和战争威胁。一九五零年六月二十七日，美国前任总统杜鲁门发表声明，宣布派遣武装力量侵略朝鲜，同时侵略中国领土台湾，并加紧干涉印度支那战争。从那时起，美国政府对于台湾的各种武装侵略活动一天比一天加紧。尤其是在朝鲜战争停止和印度支那和平恢复以后，由于国际紧张局势的逐步趋于和缓，使得畏惧和平的美国统治集团深为不安，于是他们就更加加紧利用逃在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团，对中国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性的和破坏性的战争，以图扩大对中国的侵略，并在亚洲制造新的紧张局势。
    现在，我受权代表中华人民共和国政府，将美国政府武装侵略中国领土台湾的有关事实，提请联合国大会第九届会议予以最严重的注意：
      一、自一九五零年六月美国第七舰队侵入台湾海峡以来，中国的台湾省已经沦于美国的直接军事控制之下。美国舰队一直在包括南起广东汕头北至山东青岛的靠近中国的海面上进行所谓巡逻和侦察，并占领了台湾的高雄港、基隆港和澎湖列岛的马公港作为海军基地。一九五零年八月，美国远东空军司令部所属第十三航空队侵入台湾，建立了所谓“台湾前进指挥所”。四年多以来，美国远东空军司令部所属第十三航空队和第二十航空队的机队就不断飞往台湾活动，并侵占了台湾的台南、桃园、新竹、嘉义、松山、台中和澎湖列岛的马公港作为空军基地。这样，美国就不仅侵占了中国的领土台湾，而且已经把台湾变成了准备扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略的据点。
    二、为了扩大对中国的侵略，美国政府一直在加紧训练蒋介石卖国集团的军队。美国政府派驻台湾的“军事援助顾问团”不断为蒋介石卖国集团整编、装备和训练陆海空军部队。蒋介石卖国集团的各种武器，包括枪、炮、弹药、战车、飞机、军舰在内，完全是由美国政府供给的。在美国阻挠印度支那停战的阴谋失败以后，美国“军事援助顾问团”为了配合美国政府制造新的紧张局势的政策，重新规定了对蒋介石卖国集团军队的训练方针，这就是加强进攻训练，特别着重两栖作战的训练。根据最近的新闻报道，美国政府还准备在今后两三个月内，在台湾组成一个“美国联合军事总部”，包括美国在台湾的“军事援助顾问团”在内，以便直接控制蒋介石卖国集团的军队。
    三、为了利用蒋介石卖国集团扩大对中国的侵略，美国政府还对蒋介石卖国集团提供了巨额的军事援助和经济援助的款项。根据现有的材料，从一九五零年七月起至一九五四年六月止，这些款项总共约在十四亿美元以上，它成为蒋介石卖国集团进行战争的主要财源。
    四、蒋介石卖国集团在美国政府的指使和支持之下，一直在对中国大陆和沿海进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争。这个卖国集团历年来不断偷袭中国江苏、浙江、福建、广东等省的沿海地区和岛屿，轰炸中国沿海城市，屠杀中国人民，并由海上派遣特务或由飞机空投特务到中国大陆进行暗害工作。最近，这个卖国集团为了执行美国扩大对中国的侵略的政策，不仅更加猖獗地进行上述的破坏活动，并且还在叫嚣反攻大陆，妄图把全中国变为美国的殖民地。
    五、为了封锁中华人民共和国和阻挠中国同其他国家的贸易，美国政府一直协助蒋介石卖国集团抢劫和扣留中国船舶和各国前来中国通商的船舶。根据不完全的统计，几年来受害的中国船舶共达四百七十余艘，受害的外国船舶共达六十七艘，其中包括属于苏联、波兰、英国、丹麦、挪威、意大利、荷兰、巴拿马、希腊、西德等国籍的船舶，而以属于英国的为最多。这些船舶，有的被劫持扣留，有的被击沉，有的遭袭击，有的受抢劫。美国政府指使蒋介石卖国集团进行的这些海盗行为，横暴地破坏了公海航行自由的原则。
    六、美国政府为了支持蒋介石卖国集团的战争活动，曾直接派遣他们的军用飞机侵犯中国领空，进行示威和挑衅，使中国人民的生命财产遭受重大损失。美国政府还派遣军用飞机侵入中国领空进行战略侦察，并空投间谍分子进行破坏活动。一九五四年七月二十六日，美国军用飞机竟在中国海南岛上空，击落中国飞机两架。最近，美国政府已毫不掩饰地扬言，要以武装力量干涉中国人民解放台湾的正义事业。这些都证明美国政府是在处心积虑地要扩大对中国的武装干涉。七、还应指出，在朝鲜战争停止和印度支那和平恢复之后，美国政府由于不甘心于他们在亚洲的侵略政策的失败，已采取扩大侵略范围的措施。一九五四年九月，美国纠集了八个国家在马尼拉举行会议，组织了一个以中华人民共和国为主要敌对目标的东南亚军事集团。美国政府还企图拼凑日本反动势力、李承晚集团和蒋介石卖国集团组织所谓“东北亚防御联盟”。同时，美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团正在进行谈判，积极策划订立所谓“共同安全双边条约”。美国政府显然企图通过这一系列的措施，以台湾为枢纽，形成对中华人民共和国的包围，进行新的军事冒险。
    上述的一切事实完全证明，美国政府继续侵占台湾、庇护蒋介石卖国集团、并阻挠中国人民解放台湾的行为，不仅是侵犯中国的主权和领土完整，干涉中国的内政，准备扩大对中国的侵略，并且是增加远东的战争威胁，紧张国际的局势。美国政府的这种侵略政策和战争政策，和他们在联合国内继续阻挠恢复中华人民共和国的合法地位和权利的行为，都是同联合国宪章的宗旨和原则绝不相容的。
    台湾是中国神圣不可侵犯的领土，决不容许美国侵占，也决不容许任何人以所谓“中立化”和“交由联合国托管”的名义，使台湾脱离中国。解放台湾是中国的内政，决不容许他国干涉。中国人民解放台湾不仅是为了维护中国的主权、统一和领土完整，而且是为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平和安全。中国人民解放台湾的正义行为，同尊重民族权利的联合国宪章的精神完全相合，而干涉中国人民解放台湾的任何行为，都违反联合国宪章第二条关于联合国和它的会员国不得侵害任何会员国或国家的领土完整或政治独立、不得干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖的事件的规定。
    为了维护中国的主权和领土完整，为了保卫国际的和平和安全，为了维护联合国宪章的尊严，我现在代表中华人民共和国政府向联合国大会第九届会议重新提出对美国武装侵略中国领土台湾的控诉。中华人民共和国政府认为，联合国大会第九届会议应该负起义不容辞的责任，促使安全理事会制止美国政府为了干涉中国人民解放台湾而进行的侵略行动，并责令美国政府自台湾、澎湖列岛和其他属于中国的岛屿完全撤走美国的各种武装力量和一切军事人员。
    秘书长先生，我请求你将这个控诉电的全文在联合国大会上分发给除蒋介石国民党代表以外的各国代表团。
    专此奉达，即希查照。
    中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来
                  一九五四年十月十日于北京
