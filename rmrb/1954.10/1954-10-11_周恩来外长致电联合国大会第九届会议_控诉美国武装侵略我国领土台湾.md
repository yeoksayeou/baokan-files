Xinhua News Agency, October 10th:

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai cabled the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 10th, denouncing the United States' armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan. The text of the cable is as follows: To Mr. Hammarskj√∂ld, Secretary-General of the United Nations, New York, and to Dr. van Kleffens, President of the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly:

Regarding the issue of the United States of America's armed aggression against the Chinese territory of Taiwan, the Government of the People's Republic of China previously submitted a complaint to Mr. Malik, President of the United Nations Security Council, in a cable dated August 24, 1950. During the Security Council's discussion of the "Complaint of Armed Aggression Against Taiwan," Mr. Wu Xiuquan, a specially appointed representative of the Government of the People's Republic of China, attended the meeting on November 28, 1950, to present his views. He confirmed the crime of the United States government's armed aggression against Taiwan based on various undeniable facts. Due to the obstruction of the United States, the Security Council has been unable to take effective measures based on the principles of the United Nations Charter to maintain international peace and security. The "Complaint of Armed Aggression Against Taiwan" remains on the Security Council's agenda and has not been resolved.

In order to safeguard international peace and security, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics submitted a complaint to the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 20, 1950, regarding the United States' aggression against China. When presenting his views on this complaint at the meeting of the Political and Security Committee of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on November 27, 1950, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky suggested that the General Assembly request the Security Council to take necessary actions to immediately stop the United States' aggression against China. Also due to the obstruction of the United States, the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly did not request the Security Council to take necessary and effective measures, but allowed the United States' aggression against China to continue and develop, thus posing an increasingly serious threat to the security of the People's Republic of China and the peace of Asia and the world.

It is known to all that Taiwan is Chinese territory. The "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," which the United States government participated in signing, both acknowledged that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands should be returned to China. In fact, Taiwan was taken over by the then Chinese government on October 25, 1945.

After Taiwan's return to China, the United States government repeatedly stated and guaranteed that it would respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and would not interfere in the situation in Taiwan with armed forces. On January 5, 1950, former U.S. President Truman issued a statement on the Taiwan issue, saying: "The United States has no predatory ambitions with respect to Taiwan or any other Chinese territory. Nor does it have any intention of acquiring special rights or privileges or establishing military bases on Taiwan. Nor does it contemplate using its armed forces to interfere in the present situation. The U.S. Government will not pursue a course which would lead to involvement in the civil conflict in China. Similarly, the U.S. Government will not provide military aid or advice to Chinese forces on Taiwan." On February 9, 1950, the U.S. State Department submitted a document on the Taiwan issue to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. In this document, the U.S. government stated:

"If the United States Government were to attempt to establish a non-Chinese administration in Taiwan through the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Japan, through the United Nations, or through a plebiscite conducted by the Far Eastern Commission, this would be interpreted almost universally in mainland China and widely in Asia as a violation by this Government of its assurances, and a departure from our long-standing policy of respecting China's territorial integrity, and an attempt to detach Taiwan from China." These two citations are sufficient to show that the United States government has long recognized that not interfering in the Taiwan situation with armed forces is an unshakable obligation of the United States or any other foreign or international organization. Violating this obligation would be interfering in China's internal affairs and undermining China's territorial integrity, which would be a violation of the basic principles of the United Nations.

However, the United States government has not abided by its own promises and the obligations established by various international agreements. When they saw that the possibility of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique re-enslaving the Chinese people was completely hopeless, they began to carry out armed intervention and threats of war against China from three main directions: Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina. On June 27, 1950, former U.S. President Truman issued a statement announcing the dispatch of armed forces to invade Korea, while invading Chinese territory Taiwan and intensifying interference in the Indochina War. Since then, the United States government's various armed aggression activities against Taiwan have intensified day by day. Especially after the cessation of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the gradual easing of international tensions made the U.S. ruling clique, which feared peace, deeply uneasy. Therefore, they intensified their use of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, who had fled to Taiwan, to carry out harassing and destructive warfare against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas, in an attempt to expand their aggression against China and create new tensions in Asia.

Now, I am authorized to represent the Government of the People's Republic of China to bring the relevant facts of the United States government's armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan to the most serious attention of the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly:

	1.	Since the U.S. Seventh Fleet invaded the Taiwan Strait in June 1950, China's Taiwan Province has fallen under the direct military control of the United States. The U.S. fleet has been conducting so-called patrols and reconnaissance in the seas close to China, including from Shantou in Guangdong Province in the south to Qingdao in Shandong Province in the north, and has occupied the ports of Kaohsiung and Keelung in Taiwan and Makung Port in the Penghu Islands as naval bases. In August 1950, the Thirteenth Air Force, subordinate to the U.S. Far East Air Force Command, invaded Taiwan and established a so-called "Taiwan Forward Command Post." For more than four years, the aircraft fleets of the Thirteenth and Twentieth Air Forces, subordinate to the U.S. Far East Air Force Command, have been constantly flying to Taiwan for activities, and have occupied Tainan, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Chiayi, Songshan, Taichung, and Makung Port in the Penghu Islands in Taiwan as air force bases. In this way, the United States has not only invaded Chinese territory Taiwan, but has also turned Taiwan into a base for preparing to expand its aggression against the People's Republic of China.
	2.	In order to expand its aggression against China, the United States government has been intensifying the training of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's army. The "Military Assistance Advisory Group" stationed in Taiwan by the United States government is constantly reorganizing, equipping, and training the army, navy, and air force of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The various weapons of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, including guns, cannons, ammunition, tanks, airplanes, and warships, are entirely supplied by the United States government. After the failure of the U.S. government's conspiracy to obstruct the ceasefire in Indochina, the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group," in order to cooperate with the U.S. government's policy of creating new tensions, re-defined the training policy for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's army, which is to strengthen offensive training, with particular emphasis on amphibious operations training. According to recent news reports, the U.S. government is also preparing to form a "U.S. Joint Military Headquarters" in Taiwan in the next two or three months, including the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Taiwan, in order to directly control the army of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
	3.	In order to use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to expand its aggression against China, the United States government has also provided the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique with huge amounts of military and economic assistance funds. According to existing materials, from July 1950 to June 1954, these funds totaled approximately more than 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, which has become the main financial source for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to wage war.
	4.	Under the instigation and support of the United States government, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has been carrying out harassing and destructive warfare against the Chinese mainland and coastal areas. Over the years, this traitorous clique has continuously attacked the coastal areas and islands of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces in China, bombed Chinese coastal cities, massacred Chinese people, and sent special agents by sea or airdropped them by plane to the Chinese mainland to carry out assassination work. Recently, in order to implement the U.S. policy of expanding aggression against China, this traitorous clique has not only intensified the above-mentioned destructive activities, but has also clamored for counter-attacking the mainland, attempting to turn the whole of China into a U.S. colony.
	5.	In order to blockade the People's Republic of China and obstruct trade between China and other countries, the United States government has been assisting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in robbing and detaining Chinese ships and ships from various countries coming to China for trade. According to incomplete statistics, over the past few years, more than 470 Chinese ships and more than 67 foreign ships have been victimized, including ships belonging to the Soviet Union, Poland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, Panama, Greece, West Germany, and other countries, with the United Kingdom having the most. Some of these ships were hijacked and detained, some were sunk, some were attacked, and some were robbed. These piratical acts carried out by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique under the instigation of the United States government have violently undermined the principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas.
	6.	In order to support the war activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the United States government has directly sent its military aircraft to invade Chinese airspace to carry out demonstrations and provocations, causing heavy losses to the lives and property of the Chinese people. The United States government has also sent military aircraft to invade Chinese airspace for strategic reconnaissance, and airdropped spies to carry out sabotage activities. On July 26, 1954, U.S. military aircraft shot down two Chinese aircraft over Hainan Island in China. Recently, the U.S. government has blatantly clamored that it will interfere with the just cause of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan with armed forces. These all prove that the U.S. government is deliberately trying to expand its armed intervention against China.
	7.	It should also be pointed out that after the cessation of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the U.S. government, unwilling to accept the failure of its aggressive policy in Asia, has taken measures to expand the scope of aggression. In September 1954, the United States gathered eight countries in Manila to hold a meeting and organized a Southeast Asia military bloc with the People's Republic of China as its main target. The U.S. government is also attempting to piece together Japanese reactionary forces, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to organize a so-called "Northeast Asia Defense Alliance." At the same time, the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are conducting negotiations and actively planning to conclude a so-called "Bilateral Treaty of Common Security." The U.S. government is clearly attempting to form an encirclement of the People's Republic of China, with Taiwan as its hub, through this series of measures, and to carry out new military adventures.

All the above facts fully prove that the U.S. government's continued occupation of Taiwan, sheltering of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and obstruction of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan are not only an infringement on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, an interference in China's internal affairs, and a preparation for expanding aggression against China, but also an increase in the threat of war in the Far East and a tension of the international situation. The U.S. government's policy of aggression and war, and its continued obstruction of the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate status and rights in the United Nations, are all completely incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.

Taiwan is China's sacred and inviolable territory, and it will never be allowed for the United States to occupy it, nor will anyone be allowed to detach Taiwan from China in the name of so-called "neutralization" and "placing it under United Nations trusteeship." The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and no other country is allowed to interfere. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is not only to safeguard China's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, but also to defend the peace and security of Asia and the world. The Chinese people's just act of liberating Taiwan is fully in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, which respects national rights, while any act of interfering with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan violates Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that the United Nations and its member states shall not infringe on the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or country, nor shall they interfere in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any country.

In order to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in order to defend international peace and security, and in order to uphold the dignity of the United Nations Charter, I now, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, re-submit the complaint against the United States' armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan to the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly should assume its unshirkable responsibility to urge the Security Council to stop the U.S. government's aggression aimed at interfering with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and to order the U.S. government to completely withdraw all U.S. armed forces and all military personnel from Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other islands belonging to China.

Mr. Secretary-General, I request you to distribute the full text of this complaint cable to the delegations of all countries except the Kuomintang delegation of Chiang Kai-shek at the United Nations General Assembly.

Respectfully submitted, for your consideration.

Zhou Enlai
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
October 10, 1954, in Beijing
