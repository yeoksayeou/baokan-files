Strive to Do a Good Job in This Year's Unified Grain Purchase Work

The autumn harvest of agricultural products has now begun to come onto the market successively, and this year's autumn tax collection and purchase work has begun. Ensuring the completion of this year's autumn grain collection and unified purchase tasks is an important political and economic task for rural party committees and people's committees at all levels.

Doing a good job in this year's unified grain purchase work is particularly important. As everyone knows, this year the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin experienced the largest floods in nearly a century. Although the people's government and the local people struggled against the floods and achieved significant results, many low-lying areas along the Yangtze, Huai, and lake regions still suffered from rain and flood disasters. Other areas also experienced varying degrees of disasters. Under these circumstances, on the one hand, the state must reasonably reduce or exempt agricultural taxes for disaster-stricken farmers based on the severity of the disaster; on the other hand, the state's grain expenditure in disaster areas will increase. This is because some disaster-stricken households do not have enough grain and need to buy grain from the state; for some severely affected farmers, the state must also provide appropriate relief, and the state's expenditure on disaster relief will obviously increase. During the years when the state is implementing the First Five-Year Plan, many large construction projects will start one after another, and the state must control sufficient grain to ensure the needs of industrial cities and all aspects. At the same time, the logistical support needs for liberating Taiwan will also increase. These situations indicate that the state's grain supply and sales tasks this year are still very arduous. Therefore, this year's grain collection and purchase tasks must be resolutely completed and strive to exceed the target.

It is entirely possible to complete this year's grain collection and purchase tasks. First, although this year's floods greatly exceeded the extent of those in 1931, thanks to the achievements in water conservancy construction in recent years, and the formation of millions of flood prevention forces under the leadership of party and government organs at all levels, the expansion of the disaster was effectively overcome and prevented. As a result, the degree of the disaster was much smaller than in 1931. Moreover, disaster areas have vigorously carried out replanting and supplementary planting work, and non-disaster areas have transferred seeds to support them. In particular, hundreds of millions of people in non-disaster areas have used every possibility to vigorously carry out new production increase movements on the basis of the original production increase plan. Therefore, it is estimated that the country's grain output can still be increased to a certain extent compared with last year, which is the material basis for completing this year's grain collection and purchase tasks. Second, the absolute increase in this year's grain revenue plan is smaller than the absolute increase in the domestic market grain sales plan, and the absolute increase in grain inventory is more than a quarter less than last year. This makes the supply more secure and conducive to the completion of grain collection and purchase tasks. Third, after the publicity of the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period last year and the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, cadres of party and government organs at all levels and the broad masses of people have a better understanding of the state's grain policy, and their socialist awareness and policy level have been further improved. This is also conducive to completing this year's grain collection and purchase tasks.

However, it must be pointed out that under the current situation where the production of commodity grain cannot keep up with the needs of development, in order for the state to have the strength to balance supply and sales, cope with possible special needs, adapt to the gradual development of agricultural production cooperatives, and enhance grain reserves, it is of particular importance. Therefore, it is necessary to do a good job in the unified purchase of grain, control the source of grain, and increase the inventory and reserves of grain. After the unified purchase and sale of grain was implemented in the fourth quarter of last year, although the grain inventory at the end of the previous year increased to a certain extent, this was based on a relatively thin original inventory, and the situation of insufficient inventory was not fundamentally changed. It cannot completely solve the contradictions of imbalance between varieties, regions, and seasons in grain supply. It cannot really be regarded as the state's grain reserve. Therefore, increasing inventory and accumulating grain reserves are still major tasks at present. In this regard, any idea that does not attach importance to accumulating grain reserves is wrong, and it will become an ideological obstacle to completing the state's collection, purchase, and inventory tasks, which must be prevented and overcome.

Here, it must be made clear to farmers in non-disaster areas that if everyone sells a little more grain to the state, it can solve the great difficulties of compatriots in disaster areas; farmers in disaster areas once sacrificed their crops to maintain the bumper harvest in other areas, and the state has also paid a large amount of compensation for this, so it is necessary and appropriate for farmers in non-disaster areas to pay a little more public grain and give them a certain amount of compensation. It is necessary to explain to farmers the importance of supporting economic construction and national defense. It should also be explained to farmers in non-disaster areas that the burden on farmers now is much smaller than the rate of increase in agricultural production. Therefore, the broad masses of farmers should actively support the policy of grain collection and purchase.

In this year's unified grain purchase work, the principle of purchasing as much as possible and organizing supply reasonably should be adopted. As for the grain that farmers are willing to sell for turnover, in addition to exchanging and adjusting it in the national grain market, the state can also purchase it on a voluntary basis. The scope of unified purchase is difficult to stipulate rigidly, and each place can adapt to local conditions. Last year, some places and some farmers resisted selling, and the surplus grain should have been sold but was not, or was not sold enough, and even purchased grain through planned supply. These require improvement in this year's work.

While carrying out the unified purchase of grain, the supply of grain should also be correctly organized to ensure reasonable needs. We must not only meet the needs of urban people and grain-deficient households in rural areas, but also prevent the blind expansion of supply and sales. The unified purchase and sale of grain should be carried out at the same time as taking stock of the situation; it must be done as far as possible to gradually supply those who should be supplied and not supply those who should not be supplied. Some places did not do well in this regard last year. Some grain-deficient farmers were not adequately supplied, while some farmers who were not short of grain purchased grain through improper means for speculation. Attention should be paid to this this year.

During the period of unified purchase, under the unified leadership and deployment of the party committee, the relevant financial and economic departments must divide their responsibilities, cooperate and act in concert, do a good job in various economic and business tasks, do a good job in the supply of materials, market management, and currency issuance and withdrawal; do a good job in grain quality inspection and pricing, receiving and warehousing, storage and management, and dispatching and transportation. According to last year's experience, doing these tasks well depends on thorough preparation, careful planning, and organization work in advance. Only in this way can the arduous work of grain collection, unified purchase, and unified sales, which are integrated, be guaranteed to be done well.

This year's unified grain purchase work must also be carried out together with the heavy tasks of unified purchase of cotton, unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth, and unified purchase and sale of oil and oil products, or completed within the same period. We have no experience or insufficient experience in these tasks; these tasks are related to the interests of the broad masses of the people, especially the direct interests of nearly 500 million farmers, and involve complex and profound ideological struggles and sharp class struggles. It must be ensured that it is conducive to stabilizing the market and guaranteeing construction, and also conducive to agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture. Neither can be neglected. Therefore, a lot of hard work must be done, socialist ideological education must be strengthened, and there must be no slackening, paralysis, or negligence. Therefore, the whole party must attach great importance to it, hold good cadre meetings, assign major cadres to be responsible for leadership, work diligently, and fully concentrate on doing the work well. In terms of approach, it is necessary to focus on mutual assistance and cooperation and agricultural production, the center of rural work, start with production, and regard grain work and several other economic tasks as the focus of rural work within a certain period, conduct in-depth mobilization, fully deliberate, quickly launch, and complete them in one go, so as to promptly switch to production work. Now that the autumn harvest is about to begin, party committees at all levels should immediately start and seize the time to carry out this huge task.

### 努力做好今年粮食统购工作

    努力做好今年粮食统购工作
    现在秋季农产品已开始陆续上市，本年度的秋征和秋购工作开始了。保证完成今年秋季粮食征收和统购任务乃是当前农村各级党委和各级人民委员会的一项重要政治任务和经济任务。
    做好今年粮食统购工作是特别重要的。大家都知道，今年长江中下游和淮河沿岸一带发生了近百年来最大的洪水，虽然由于人民政府和当地人民努力与洪水作斗争，收到公认的巨大的效果，但是沿江、沿淮和滨湖许多低洼地区，还是受到了雨涝灾害。其他部分地区也发生了轻重不同的灾害。在这种情况之下，一方面，国家对受灾的农民，必须根据灾情轻重，合理地减征或者免征农业税；另一方面，国家在灾区的粮食支出却要增加。这是因为有些受灾户口粮不足，要向国家买粮；有些受灾很重的农户，国家还必须适当加以救济，国家在救灾方面的开支显然增加。而在国家实行第一个五年计划的年代中，许多大的建设工程都要陆续开工，国家必须掌握足够的粮食，以便保证工业城市和各方面的需要。同时，解放台湾的后勤支前的需要也将有增加。这些情况说明，本年度国家粮食的供销任务仍然是十分艰巨的。因此，本年度的粮食征、购任务必须坚决完成，并要力争超过。
    完成本年度的粮食征、购任务是完全有可能的。第一，今年的洪水虽然大大超过了一九三一年的程度，但由于几年来水利建设上的成就，和在各地党、政机关领导下组成了千百万防汛大军，有力地克服和制止了灾情的扩大，因而灾害的程度却大大小于一九三一年。而且灾区还大力进行了抢种、补种工作，非灾区都调运种籽支援。特别是几万万非灾区人民利用一切可能，在原来增产计划的基础上，大力开展新增产运动。因此，估计全国的粮食产量仍可比去年有一定的增加，这是完成今年粮食征、购任务的物质基础。第二，本年度粮食收入计划增加的绝对数字小于国内市场粮食销售计划增加的绝对数字，而粮食库存增加的绝对数又比上年度少了四分之一以上。这就使供应更有保证，有利于粮食征、购任务的完成。第三，经过去年国家过渡时期总路线总任务的宣传和实行粮食的统购统销之后，各级党政机关干部和广大人民，对国家粮食政策有了认识，社会主义觉悟和政策水平都有了进一步的提高。这也有利于完成今年的粮食征、购任务。
    但是，必须指出，在目前商品粮食的生产赶不上需要发展的情况下，为了使国家有力量平衡供销，应付可能发生的特殊的需要，适应农业生产合作化的逐步发展，增强粮食后备就有着特别重要的意义。因此，必须做好粮食统购工作，掌握粮源，增加粮食的库存和后备。去年第四季度开始实行了粮食统购统销之后，虽然上年度期末的粮食库存有了一定增加，但因为这是在原来库存底子较薄的基础上增加的，并未根本改变库存不足的状况，它还不能完全解决粮食供应上存在的品种间、地区间和季节间不平衡的矛盾。还不能真正算作国家的粮食后备。因此，增加库存、积累粮食后备还是当前的重大任务。在这方面，任何不重视积累粮食后备的想法，都是不对的，它将成为完成国家征、购和库存任务的思想障碍，必须加以防止和克服。
    在这里必须使非灾区的农民懂得：大家多卖一点粮食，交给国家，就可以解决灾区同胞的很大困难；灾区农民曾经用牺牲自己庄稼的代价，保持了其他地区的丰收，国家为此也付出了大批赔偿费用，因此非灾区农民多缴纳一点公粮，给予他们一定的报偿是必需的而且也是应该的。要向农民说明支援经济建设和支援国防的重要意义。也要向非灾区农民说明：现在农民的负担，比起农业生产增加的比率要小得多了。因此，广大农民应该积极支持食粮的征、购政策。
    在今年粮食统购工作中，应该采取尽量多购、合理组织供应的原则。至于农民进行周转愿意出售的粮食，除在国家粮食市场交换调剂以外，在自愿的原则下，国家也可予以收购。统购面很难硬性规定，各地可因地制宜。去年有些地方，有些农民抗拒出售，余粮应卖未卖，或则没有卖足，甚至在计划供应中套购了粮食，这些都要求在今年工作中能够有所改进。
    在粮食统购的同时，还应正确组织粮食供应，保证合理的需要。我们既要满足城市人民和农村缺粮户的需要，又要防止盲目扩大供销。粮食的统购统销应该同时摸底，结合进行；必须尽可能地逐步地作到该供应者供应，不该供应者不供应。这方面上年度有些地方作得不好，有些缺粮农民供应不足，有些不缺粮食的农民反套购了粮食，进行投机，今年应加注意。
    统购期间，在党委统一领导和部署之下，各有关财经部门必须分工负责协同动作，做好各种经济工作和业务工作，做好物资的供应、市场的管理和货币的投放回笼工作；做好粮食的验质作价、接收入库、仓储保管和调度运输工作。根据去年的经验，做好这些工作决定于事前的充分准备、周密计划和组织工作。只有这样，才能使粮食的征收、统购和统销这三位一体的艰巨工作保证做好。
    今年的粮食统购工作还必须和繁重的棉花统购、棉布统购统销和油料、油脂统购统销的工作一体进行，或在同一时期内完成。对于这些工作，我们还没有经验或者经验不足；这些工作同广大人民发生着利害关系，首先同将近五万万的农民发生着直接的利害关系，有着复杂深刻的思想斗争和尖锐的阶级斗争。必须做到既利于稳定市场、保障建设，又利于农业生产和农业的社会主义改造。二者不能偏废。因此必须进行许多艰苦的工作，加强社会主义的思想教育，丝毫不能放任麻痹，疏忽大意。因此全党必须高度重视，开好干部会议，指定主要干部负责领导，兢兢业业，全力贯注，把工作做好。在作法上，必须围绕互助合作、农业生产这一农村工作的中心，从生产入手，在一定的时期内，将粮食工作和其他几项经济工作，当作农村工作的重点，深入发动，充分酝酿，迅速展开，一气呵成，以便及时转入生产工作。现在秋收就要开始，各级党委应该立刻动手，抓紧进行这个巨大的工作。
