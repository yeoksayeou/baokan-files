    Reading Groups Are a Good Way to Propagandize and Encourage Farmers
    Feng Ruren
    Since liberation, especially after the land reform, reading newspapers has greatly developed in the countryside. Many villages, mutual aid teams, and agricultural production cooperatives have organized reading groups. The masses have begun to understand the importance of reading newspapers and regard participating in reading activities as an important method for learning politics, culture, and production technology. Under these circumstances, reading groups have experienced tremendous development throughout the country. Especially since last winter and this spring, with the large-scale development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations and the increase in the number of middle and primary school graduates engaged in agricultural production, reading groups have experienced new development. Reading groups that had ceased activities have also been restored and rectified. For example, in the first district of Helan, Ningxia, six townships newly developed eighty-six reading groups and restored and reorganized forty reading groups in April of this year. One hundred and seven of these reading groups were established in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and all rural educated youths participated in reading groups, serving as group leaders or readers.
    In recent years, the establishment of reading groups and reading activities in various regions have played a significant role in raising the political consciousness of the masses and promoting rural work. The masses call newspapers "the key to happiness," "treasure chests," and "clairvoyants." In Inner Mongolia, many members of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have improved their socialist awareness through reading newspapers, recognized the importance of implementing socialist transformation of agriculture, and greatly stimulated their production enthusiasm. Many teams and cooperatives have also learned production management experience and production technology from newspapers, improved team and cooperative systems, and improved production. For example, some mutual aid teams had many disagreements among members because they could not achieve equivalent exchange. After reading the newspaper, they solved this problem. Some newly established agricultural production cooperatives, after reading and studying newspapers, did a good job of "four evaluations" (evaluating land, labor, farm tools, and livestock) and solved the problem of wasting labor. Farmers in some areas, after reading newspapers, realized the importance of oils and fats for supporting national industrial construction and expanded the planting area of ​​oil crops. Some farmers who were not content with agricultural production, after reading newspapers, realized the importance of agricultural production and the prospects of agricultural cooperation, and began to settle down for agricultural production. The experience of many places proves that the establishment and activities of reading groups not only educate the masses who participate in reading and improve their political awareness, but also promote production; moreover, when members of the reading group understand the truth after reading the newspaper, they can actively conduct propaganda to the masses who have not participated in reading, and the reading group becomes a strong propaganda team and a part of the Party's propaganda network. Many Party propagandists participate in reading, serve as reading group leaders or readers. Through reading newspapers, they further increased their knowledge, enriched the content of propaganda, strengthened their connection with the masses, and enlivened the work of the Party's propaganda network even more.
    According to the existing experience of various regions, the most important thing to run a reading group well is that the reading group should be combined with mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Establishing reading groups in mutual aid teams, especially in agricultural production cooperatives, can both consolidate the reading groups and promote the production of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. Teams and cooperatives select relevant materials from the newspapers according to their specific circumstances and production requirements, and discuss them, which can accurately ensure that the reading group serves production and helps improve mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In Inner Mongolia, during this year's spring plowing production, due to the combination with mutual aid and cooperation organizations, most of the reading groups persisted in reading newspapers and promoted production. Some reading groups that had been organized in a scattered manner were also restored and consolidated due to their combination with mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The benefits of combining reading groups with mutual aid and cooperation organizations are: (1) It is easy to promote reading activities throughout the countryside through reading activities organized by mutual aid and cooperation organizations. (2) It is easy to solve the problem of newspaper fees. In the past, some reading groups often collapsed because newspaper fees were difficult to solve. However, once the reading group is established in a mutual aid and cooperation organization, some cooperatives and teams have public welfare funds or reserve funds, which makes it possible to solve the problem of newspaper fees. Even if there is no reserve fund in the mutual aid team, the members can share the newspaper fees. (3) It is easy to solve the problem of readers. Agricultural production cooperatives have accountants, and mutual aid teams have bookkeepers, and most cooperatives and teams have propagandists. Some agricultural production cooperatives also have propagandist groups. Especially now that many middle and primary school graduates participate in the labor of agricultural production cooperatives, they can all take on the task of reading group leaders or readers.
    (4) It is easy to solve problems such as reading time, location, and lamp oil. Because mutual aid and cooperation organizations are collective production, reading time and location can take advantage of the gaps in various meetings and rest time in the fields. The combination of reading groups with mutual aid and cooperation organizations means that there are many benefits to establishing reading groups in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and this should be regarded as the focus of developing reading groups; but it does not mean that reading groups cannot be established among farmers who have not yet been organized. Among the farmers who have not yet been organized, as long as they have the conditions to establish reading groups, especially under the principle of voluntariness, it is still necessary to appropriately establish reading groups. In the past, the reading groups established by various regions among farmers who had not yet been organized also played a significant role. Secondly, to make reading work well, reading should strive to have a center and be closely combined with the current production problems and the ideological problems of the masses. Reading is not about reading every word and sentence in the newspaper verbatim, but about the reader first reading the newspaper, and then selecting different articles in the newspaper to read according to different objects, and also explaining while reading. For the masses with very low cultural levels, even only explain without reading. Only in this way can the masses be attracted and make them like to listen.
    Secondly, Party organizations at all levels in rural areas, especially Party branches, must give full attention to reading groups and give them specific leadership in order to consolidate and develop reading groups and enable Party newspapers to play an educational role for the masses. At present, there are Party propagandists or propagandist groups in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and most agricultural production cooperatives have directors or deputy directors who concurrently manage or specialize in the political work of the cooperative. Party branches should manage reading groups through them and give them guidance. Some local rural Party branches educate Party members to participate in reading newspapers, so that they can strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership over the peasant masses and promote the entire rural work. Some local rural Party branches also help reading groups establish and gradually improve the collective reading system, truly achieving the role of ordering a newspaper and playing its role. The experience of various places also proves that it is of great benefit to the active propaganda work of the Party for the Party branch to lead the reading group like leading the propagandist, and to combine the propagandist and the reading group. The combination of propagandists and reading groups, on the one hand, through propagandists, makes it easy for Party branches to lead reading groups; on the other hand, it can also make reading group members their powerful assistants in propaganda. In addition to the Party branch attaching importance to and strengthening the leadership of the reading group, county and district leaders must also provide guidance. Between this spring and summer, the Helan County Committee of the Communist Party of China in the former Ningxia Province and the Ningxia Daily jointly organized a working group to cooperate with the local Party organization in the first district of the county to rectify and develop the work of the reading group, and gained some experience. The secretary of the District Committee of Helan District 1 attached great importance to the rectification and development of the reading group work. During the trial run, he personally mobilized, deployed, and went deep into the township to inspect and guide, thus improving the work enthusiasm of all cadres and enhancing the sense of responsibility for the work, and actively and steadily developing a group of farmer reading groups.
    In the past and now, many local Party newspapers have set up special columns to guide reading work, some set up "Reading Groups", some set up "Reading Work", "Reading Group Communications" or "Reading and Communications", etc., regularly introducing good reading experience; commending model reading groups and model readers; guiding reading groups on how to carry out reading in different seasons and in various tasks, especially in central tasks; holding discussion meetings, organizing reading groups to participate in discussions, etc., these have played a good role in consolidating and improving reading groups. These methods can still be adopted.
    At present, although rural reading organizations have developed greatly and achieved certain results, there are still many problems. The most important of these is that the development of reading groups is very uneven. In some areas with poor work and production foundations, very few farmers read newspapers, the reading work is very poor, and even some larger villages do not have newspapers. For example, in Henan Province, according to statistics in July last year, there was only one "Henan Daily" for more than 6,400 farmers. The "Henan Dazhong" newspaper was distributed more than 4,000 copies in Mi County, but only five copies in Nanyang County. In Nan County, Hunan Province, there is not a single newspaper in a village with more than 200 residents. Although some areas have reading groups and have subscribed to newspapers, no one reads them, and the reading groups are in a state of disarray. The main reasons for the uneven development of reading groups and the lack of reading of newspapers are that rural Party organizations and district and township cadres do not pay enough attention to and lack leadership of reading groups. Some people think that reading newspapers and production are contradictory, some think that it is an "extra burden", and even some areas in the opposition to "five excesses" last year, regarded reading groups as superfluous and eliminated them together. Of course, it is wrong at any time to force the masses to organize reading groups without following the principle of voluntariness, and it must be prevented; but voluntariness is not laissez-faire, and positive leadership and assistance must be given to the reading activities of the masses. Facts have repeatedly proved that the masses have a high enthusiasm for reading newspapers. Especially after the peasants have been educated in the general line, they actively care about newspapers. In the future, rural Party organizations and district and township cadres should pay attention to appropriately developing reading groups in villages where reading groups have not been established; especially in the context of the large-scale development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations and the gradual increase in the participation of rural educated youth in agricultural production, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and credit and marketing cooperatives should organize the masses to read newspapers according to the specific situation. For those reading groups that have stopped activities, they should be appropriately restored and reorganized according to different situations.

    读报组是对农民进行宣传鼓动的良好形式
    冯鲁仁
    解放以来，特别是土地改革以后，读报工作在农村中有了很大的开展，不少乡村、互助组和农业生产合作社中都组织了读报组，群众已开始了解了读报的重要性，把参加读报活动看做是学习政治、文化和学习生产技术中的重要方法。在这种情况下，读报组在全国各地曾经有极大的发展。特别是去冬今春随着互助合作组织的大量发展和中小学毕业学生从事农业生产人数的增多，读报组有了新的发展，已经停止活动的读报组，也进行了恢复和整顿。例如前宁夏贺兰一区有六个乡在今年四月间新发展了八十六个读报组，恢复整顿了四十个读报组。这些读报组有一百零七个建立在互助组、农业生产合作社中，而且所有农村知识青年大都参加了读报组，并担任了读报组组长或读报员。
    几年来，各地读报组的建立和读报活动对提高群众的政治觉悟和推动农村工作起了不小的作用，群众称报纸为“开心的钥匙”、“百宝箱”、“千里眼”。内蒙古地区很多互助组组员和农业生产合作社社员，通过读报学习，提高了社会主义觉悟，认识了对农业实行社会主义改造的重要意义，大大激发了生产热情。很多组、社还从报上学到了生产管理经验和生产技术，健全了组、社制度，改进了生产。比如有的互助组因没有能做到等价交换，组员间意见很多，读报后，就解决了这个问题。有些新建的农业生产合作社经过读报学习，做好了“四评”
  （评土地、劳力、农具、牲口）工作，解决了窝工问题。有些地区的农民经过读报学习，认识到油脂油料对支援国家工业建设的重要作用，扩大了油料作物的种植面积。有些不安心农业生产的农民，经过读报学习认识了农业生产的重要性和农业合作化的前途，开始安心农业生产。不少地方的经验证明：读报组的建立和活动，不仅教育了参加读报的群众，提高了他们的政治觉悟，推动了生产；而且当读报组组员在读了报懂得道理后，还能积极向没有参加读报的群众进行宣传，读报组成为一支有力的宣传队伍，成为党的宣传网的一个组成部分。许多党的宣传员参加读报、担任读报组长或读报员。他们通过读报，进一步增进了自己的知识，丰富了宣传内容，加强了和群众的联系，更加活跃了党的宣传网的工作。
    根据各地已有的经验，要办好读报组，最重要的一点是读报组要同互助合作组织结合起来。在互助组、特别在农业生产合作社中建立读报组，既能巩固读报组，又能推动互助组和农业生产合作社的生产。组、社根据自己的具体情况和生产上的要求，选读报上有关材料，进行讨论，能确切做到读报组为生产服务，帮助提高互助合作组织。内蒙古各地在今年春耕生产中，由于结合了互助合作组织，读报组大都坚持了读报，推动了生产，一些已经组织涣散的读报组，也因同互助合作组织结合，得到了恢复和巩固。读报组同互助合作组织结合的好处是：（一）便于通过互助合作组织的读报活动，带动整个农村开展读报活动。（二）便于解决报费问题。过去，有些读报组往往因为报费难以解决而垮台。但一当读报组在互助合作组织中建立后，有的社、组有公益金或公积金，就有条件解决报费问题了，即使没有公积金的互助组，也能由组员们分担报费。（三）便于解决读报员问题。农业生产合作社有会计，互助组有记账员，而社、组大都有宣传员，有的农业生产合作社还有宣传员小组，特别是目前有不少中小学毕业学生参加农业生产合作社劳动后，他们大都能担当起读报组长或读报员的任务。
  （四）便于解决读报时间、地点和灯油等问题。因为互助合作组织是集体生产，读报时间和地点可以利用各种会议的空隙和地头休息时间。读报组要同互助合作组织结合起来，就是说，在互助组和农业生产合作社中建立读报组有很多好处，应该作为发展读报组的重点；但并不是说在还没有组织起来的农民群众中就不能建立读报组。在尚未组织起来的农民群众中，只要具有建立读报组的条件，特别是在自愿的原则下，适当建立读报组，仍然是必要的，各地过去在尚未组织起来的农民群众中建立的读报组，同样发挥了不小的作用。其次，要使读报工作做得好，读报应力求有中心，紧密结合当前的生产问题和群众的思想问题。读报也不是照报逐字逐句读，而是由读报员首先读了报纸，然后根据不同对象选读报上不同的文章，而且要边读边讲，对文化程度很低的群众甚至只讲不读。只有这样才能吸引群众，使群众喜欢听。
    其次，农村各级党的组织，特别是党的支部对读报组要给予充分的重视，并加以具体领导，才能使读报组得以巩固和发展，才能发挥党报对群众的教育作用。目前，互助合作组织中有党的宣传员或宣传员小组，农业生产合作社中大都有主任或副主任兼管或专管社的政治工作，党的支部应通过他们把读报组管理起来，给予指导。有的地方农村党的支部教育党员参加读报，使他们通过读报来加强党对农民群众的政治思想领导，推动整个农村工作。有的地方农村党的支部还帮助读报组建立和逐步健全集体读报的制度，真正做到了订一份报起一份报的作用。各地经验又证明：党支部把领导读报组像领导宣传员一样，并使宣传员和读报组结合起来，对活跃党的宣传工作有很大的作用。宣传员和读报组相结合，一方面通过宣传员，党的支部便于领导读报组；一方面并可使读报组组员们成为自己在宣传上的有力助手。除了党的支部重视和加强对读报组的领导外，县、区领导上还须给予指导。今年春夏间中共前宁夏省贺兰县委和宁夏日报社共同组织了一个工作组在该县一区配合当地党组织共同进行整顿和发展读报组的工作，取得了一些经验。贺兰一区区委书记很重视整顿和发展读报组工作，在试办中，亲自动员、布置，并深入到乡检查和指导，因此，提高了全体干部的工作积极性，增强了工作的责任心，积极稳步地发展了一批农民读报组。
    过去和现在，有不少地方党报都设有指导读报工作的专栏，有的设“读报组”，有的设“读报工作”、“读报组通讯”或“读报和通讯”等，经常介绍好的读报经验；表扬模范读报组和模范读报员；指导读报组在不同季节和各项工作中、特别是在中心工作中怎样进行读报；举办讨论会，组织读报组参加讨论等等，这些对读报组的巩固和提高起了良好的作用。这些方法还可采取。
    目前，农村读报组织虽有很大发展，并取得一定的成绩，但也还存在不少的问题。其中最主要的是读报组的发展很不平衡，在一些工作基础和生产基础较差的地区，农民读报的很少，读报工作很差，甚至有些较大的村庄都没有报纸。例如在河南省，去年七月统计，在六千四百多农民群众中才有一份“河南日报”，“河南大众”报在密县发行四千多份，在南阳县却只发行五份。湖南省南县一个有二百多户居民的村庄，一份报纸也没有。有的地区虽有读报组，也订了报纸，但却无人阅读，读报组陷于涣散状态。读报组发展不平衡和有报纸而无人阅读的主要原因，是农村党的组织和区乡干部对读报组重视不够和缺乏领导。有的人认为读报和生产有矛盾，有的认为是“额外负担”，甚至有的地区在去年反对“五多”时，把读报组当做多余的，一起给反掉了。当然，不按自愿原则，强迫群众组织读报组在任何时候都是错误的，必须防止的；但自愿不是自流，对群众的读报活动必须积极给予领导和帮助。事实已一再证明：群众读报热情是很高的，特别是农民在受到总路线教育之后，都积极关心报纸。今后，农村党的组织和区乡干部应该注意在没有建立读报组的村庄适当加以发展；特别是在互助合作组织大量发展和农村知识青年参加农业生产逐渐增多的情况下，在农业生产合作社、互助组以及信用、供销等合作单位，都应根据具体情况组织群众读报。对于那些已停止活动的读报组，应根据不同情况，适当加以恢复和整顿。
