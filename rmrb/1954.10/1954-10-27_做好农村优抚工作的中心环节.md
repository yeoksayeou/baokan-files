The resolution of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference in November of last year pointed out that the main task of preferential treatment work in rural areas is to mobilize and organize the families of martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in agricultural and sideline production, and to mobilize them to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations under the principle of voluntariness. Over the past year, many regions have attached importance to this work and have achieved remarkable results. According to statistics from some counties in twenty-one provinces including Shanxi, Henan, and Fujian this year, more than 60 percent of the families of martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, generally an increase of 15 to 20 percent compared to 1953. Many regions have even exceeded the proportion of local people organized. In North China, Northeast China, and other regions with a better foundation of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the number of families of martyrs, military families, etc., joining mutual aid and cooperation organizations has increased even more significantly. In some counties in Shanxi and Rehe provinces, it has reached 80 to 90 percent.

Organizing families of martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations for production is the fundamental way to solve their production and living difficulties. In Qingrong Village, Hunchun County, Jilin Province, the land of families of martyrs and military families who joined mutual aid and cooperation organizations had a 30 percent higher yield in 1952 than in 1950. Although they suffered natural disasters in 1953, they also guaranteed the same yield as in 1952 because of the promotion of new farming methods, so their lives have been continuously improved. Now, out of the eighty families of martyrs and military families in the village, seventy-eight are well-off. Jin Yushun's family, a military family with three women, lacked three months of food in 1950, had only two thin quilts, and did not have enough clothes. Two years after joining the agricultural production cooperative, the whole family added two new cotton quilts, thirty-three pieces of clothing, a set of furniture, and dug a new-style well, deposited two million yuan, and sold 2,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

Many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among the families of martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers are politically active. After participating in production, a large number of labor models and production activists have emerged. These figures have played an important role in the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the purchase of surplus grain. Yue Guanghe, a demobilized construction soldier in Gushanzi Village, Qinglong County, Rehe Province, once mobilized fifteen farmers in his mutual aid group to join the cooperative and mobilized all the masses in the village to join the cooperative. Zhang Yudong, a disabled revolutionary soldier, also persuaded his father, who had always relied solely on preferential treatment, to join the cooperative. Under the leadership and promotion of the families of martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, the number of households in the village participating in the cooperative increased from thirty last year to one hundred and forty-two this year. After the families of martyrs and military families joined the cooperative, because the land is managed uniformly, and work is divided according to skills, full laborers, semi-laborers, especially women, can play a great role. Those who cannot do heavy work can do light work; those who cannot do this kind of work can do other kinds of work, so everyone's enthusiasm for production has been improved.

Through the organization of agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid groups, daily care for the families of martyrs and military families can also be strengthened. When Li Yingshu, a military family member in the aforementioned Qingrong Village, was ill, the comrades in the cooperative kindly helped her find a doctor. Some military families did not receive letters from their relatives for a long time and were in low spirits. The relevant cooperatives or groups held forums for military families to educate them, encourage them to produce, and help them write letters to contact their relatives at the front. In this way, the political enthusiasm of the families of martyrs and military families has been improved, indirectly consolidating the armed forces.

From the above situation, it can be seen that organizing the families of martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations is the central link in doing a good job in rural preferential treatment. Now that the autumn harvest is over, all localities should learn from the experience of advanced regions in consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations and actively organize the families of martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

Some township and village cadres believe that letting the families of martyrs and military families participate in production is a bit unfair to the soldiers at the front. This idea is wrong. It should be recognized that participating in productive labor is a glorious thing for every able-bodied citizen. Organizing the families of martyrs and military families to participate in production is not only necessary for the development of production, but also necessary for completely solving the living problems of the families of martyrs and military families. Doing so is not only not unfair to the soldiers at the front, but also an encouragement to the soldiers at the front. Some families of martyrs and military families are unwilling to work, or because their land is cultivated by others and they have enough food and clothing, they are unwilling to join mutual aid groups or agricultural production cooperatives, or they are afraid that joining mutual aid groups or agricultural production cooperatives will cancel the cultivation by others, or they are afraid that they will suffer losses because of their weak labor force. Then they should be educated on the glory of labor and the socialist future, and facts should be used to eliminate their various concerns. Some members of mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives are afraid of causing trouble after the families of martyrs and military families join the group or cooperative, advocating "soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals," or believing that "the cooperative is our own, and cultivating the land for the families of martyrs and military families is the business of the whole village," and are unwilling to absorb the families of martyrs and military families into the cooperative. This is also wrong. Those group members and cooperative members who have these ideas should be well-educated in patriotism, improve their patriotic enthusiasm, their enthusiasm for supporting the army, and their enthusiasm for caring for the families of martyrs and military families, so that they can adopt a helpful and welcoming attitude towards the entry of these people into the group or cooperative.

Absorbing the families of martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers into mutual aid and cooperation organizations will inevitably encounter some specific problems. For example, how to deal with the land that the families of martyrs and military families should enjoy the cultivation of, how to calculate their participation in labor, and how to deal with the cultivation work that individual households should bear. Regarding these issues, the experience of Hebei Province published in this newspaper today can be used as a reference for other regions. If the labor force outside the cooperative is unwilling or unable to find wages from the cooperative, and the cooperative is unwilling to let the labor force outside the cooperative find work hours, the method in some areas is: the township civil affairs committee should systematically transfer the labor force outside the cooperative to the mutual aid groups or individual households that need work, and the groups or households that use the labor should pay the cooperative at the current wage rate. This method can be used as a reference. Women, the elderly, and the weak among the families of martyrs and military families can implement division of labor according to their actual labor capacity and strengths, and let them work on nearby land as much as possible, or take care of children in the nurseries during the busy farming season, etc. Special care should be given to the particularly old and weak. Some of these farmers lack means of production, and local authorities can use preferential treatment funds to subsidize them to purchase some fertilizers, livestock, agricultural tools, and other means of production, so that they can smoothly join mutual aid groups or agricultural production cooperatives.

Of course, when actively organizing the families of martyrs, military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, it is also necessary to pay attention to the principle of voluntariness, and it is not allowed to force orders for the sake of simply pursuing numbers.

    做好农村优抚工作的中心环节
    鉴远
    去年十一月第二次全国民政会议决议指出，农村中的优抚工作，主要是动员和组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加农业和副业生产，并且动员他们在自愿原则下参加互助合作组织。一年以来，许多地区都重视了这一工作，并取得了显著的成绩。根据山西、河南、福建等二十一个省部分县份今年的统计，烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作组织的已经占他们的总户数的百分之六十以上，一般比一九五三年增加了百分之十五到二十。不少地区并且已经超过当地一般群众组织起来的比例。在华北、东北等互助合作组织基础较好的地区，烈属、军属等加入互助合作组织的户数增长得更为显著。山西、热河两省有的县已经达到百分之八十到九十。
    组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作组织来进行生产，是解决他们生产上和生活上的困难的根本办法。吉林珲春县庆荣村加入互助合作组织的烈属、军属的土地，一九五二年的产量比一九五○年高百分之三十；一九五三年虽然遭受了自然灾害，但也因为推广新耕作法而保证了和一九五二年相等的产量，因此他们的生活不断得到提高。现在全村八十户烈属、军属，生活丰裕的有七十八户。军属金玉顺家三口人都是妇女，一九五○年缺三个月口粮，仅有两床薄被，衣服也不够穿；加入农业生产合作社以后两年，全家添置了两床新棉被，三十三件衣服，一付家具，并且打了新式井，存款二百万元，还卖给国家两千斤余粮。
    烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人中间本来就有许多共产党员、青年团员，政治上很积极；参加生产以后，又涌现了大批劳动模范和生产积极分子。这些人物在发展互助合作运动和收购余粮中起了重要作用。热河青龙县孤山子村复员建设军人岳光和曾经动员了自己互助组的十五户农民入社，又动员本自然村群众全体都入了社。革命残废军人张玉栋也说服了过去一直单纯依赖优抚的父亲参加了合作社，这个村在烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人的带头和推动下，全村参加合作社的户数由去年的三十户增加到今年的一百四十二户。烈属、军属们入社以后，由于土地是统一经营，分工分业，所以他们中间的整劳力、半劳力特别是妇女，都可以发挥很大作用。不能干重活的，可以干轻活；不能干这种活的，可以干别种活，所以大家的生产积极性提高了。
    通过农业生产合作社或互助组的组织，还可以加强群众对烈属、军属的日常照顾。上述庆荣村军属李英淑病了，社里同志就亲切地帮助她请医生看病。有的军属长时间接不到亲人来信，情绪不高，有关的社或组就召开军属座谈会进行教育，鼓励她们生产，并帮助她们写信，设法和前方亲人联系。这样，烈属、军属们的政治热情提高了，间接地也巩固了武装部队。
    从以上情况可以看到：组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作组织，是做好农村优抚工作的中心环节。现在秋收已过，各地在整顿和发展互助合作组织中，应该吸取先进地区的经验，积极组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作组织。
    有些乡、村干部认为，让烈属、军属们参加生产，有点对不起前方军人。这种想法是不对的。应该认识：参加生产劳动，是每一个有劳动力的公民的光荣事情。组织烈属、军属们参加生产，不仅是发展生产所必需，也是彻底解决烈属、军属们的生活问题所必需。这样作不仅没有什么对不起前方军人，而且是对前方军人的一种鼓舞。有些烈属、军属不愿意劳动，或者因为土地有人代耕，吃穿已经够用，而不愿加入互助组或农业生产合作社，或者害怕加入互助组或农业生产合作社以后取消了代耕，或者害怕因为自己劳力弱，加入互助组或农业生产合作社吃亏，那就应该对他们进行劳动光荣的教育和社会主义前途的教育，并且以事实消除他们的各种顾虑。有些互助组员和农业生产合作社员怕烈属、军属们入组或入社以后增加麻烦，主张“兵对兵，将对将”，或者认为“社是咱们自己的，给烈属、军属代耕则是全村的事”，因而不愿意吸收烈属、军属入社，这也是不对的。对于有这些思想的组员和社员，应该好好进行爱国主义教育，提高他们的爱国热情、拥军热情和关怀烈属、军属的热情，使他们对这些人的入组入社采取帮助和欢迎的态度。
    吸收烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人加入互助合作组织，必然会遇到一些具体问题。比如烈属、军属们应该享受代耕的土地怎么办，他们参加劳动应该怎么计算，单干户应该负担的代耕工应该如何处理等问题。关于这些问题，今天本报所发表的河北省的经验就可以供其他地区参考。如果社外劳力不愿意或者无力向社找工价，而合作社又不愿社外劳力找工时，有的地区的办法是：由乡民政委员会有计划地把社外劳力转给需要工的互助组或单干户，用工的组或户按当时工价再给社找工价。这种办法可作参考。烈属、军属中的妇女老弱，则可以按照各人实际劳动能力和长处实行分工分业，多让他们在附近的土地上劳动，或到农忙托儿所中看管小孩，等等；特别老弱的，给予特别照顾。这些农户有的缺少生产资料，各地可以用优抚事业费给予补助，帮他们购买一些肥料、牲口、农具等生产资料，使他们能够顺利地加入互助组或农业生产合作社。
    当然，在积极组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作组织的时候，同样需要注意自愿的原则，不允许因单纯追求数字而发生强迫命令的现象。
