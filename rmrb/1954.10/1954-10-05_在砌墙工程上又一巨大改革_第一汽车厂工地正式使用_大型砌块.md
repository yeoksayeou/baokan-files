Another Great Reform in Wall Construction
    First Automobile Works Construction Site Officially Uses "Large Blocks"

    The "large blocks" trial-produced by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant construction site have been officially used in housing construction.

    Large blocks are also called prefabricated walls. That is, the walls are prefabricated outside the construction site, and then moved to the construction site to be installed into houses. There are now two types of "large blocks" manufactured by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. One type is brick, each weighing 1.5 tons or 2 tons, used for building walls above ground. The other type is concrete blocks mixed with rubble, with the same weight as before, used for building basement walls.

    Using "large blocks" to build houses is unprecedented in our country. This is another major reform in wall construction at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant construction site after the promotion of the "inner scaffolding wall construction method." This reform has opened the way for mechanized and industrialized construction, and fundamentally changed the appearance of the construction site. Now, at the construction site using large blocks, you can't see the complicated scaffolding, nor the tense scene of pouring concrete. A large number of bricklayers and mortar carriers have gone to the factory. Wall construction will not be affected by winter and rainy seasons. Active on the scene are tall and majestic tower cranes, and a small number of crane installation workers. The employees excitedly said: "With this method, in the future, we will not be building houses, but installing houses like installing machines." (Lin Li)

    在砌墙工程上又一巨大改革
    第一汽车厂工地正式使用“大型砌块”
    第一汽车制造厂工地试制的“大型砌块”，已经正式用到房屋建筑上了。
    大型砌块又叫预制墙。就是在工地现场之外，预先把墙壁砌好，然后搬到工地现场安装成房屋。现在第一汽车制造厂制造的“大型砌块”有两种，一种是砖块，每块重达一点五吨或二吨，是砌地面上的墙壁用的；另一种是夹带毛石的混凝土块，重量同前，是砌地下室墙壁用的。
    运用“大型砌块”建筑房屋，在我国还没有先例。这是第一汽车制造厂工地在推广“里脚手砌墙法”后，在砌墙工程上的又一巨大改革。这项改革，给机械化、工厂化施工开辟了道路，并从根本上改变了工地现场的面貌。现在运用大型砌块的工地，看不见那种错综复杂的脚手架，也没有浇灌混凝土的紧张场面了。大批砌砖、挑灰的工人到工厂去了。砌墙工程将不受冬季和雨季的影响。活跃在现场上的是高大雄伟的塔式吊车，和为数不多的起重安装工人。职工们兴奋地说：“有了这个办法，往后我们就不是盖房子，而像安装机器一样的安装房子了。”（林里）
