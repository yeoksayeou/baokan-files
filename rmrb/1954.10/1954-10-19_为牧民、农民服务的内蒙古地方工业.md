Local Industry in Inner Mongolia Serving Herdsmen and Farmers
Quan Xingyuan, Director of the Industry Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has more than 18 million livestock, producing a large amount of fur; it also has cultivated land that produces grain, averaging more than 1,000 jin of grain per person per year based on the region's agricultural population. Before liberation, this region had very little industry that manufactured means of production and means of livelihood for herdsmen and farmers. Herdsmen had to painfully sell their animal products at low prices and buy the industrial products they needed at high prices, enduring the cruel exploitation of merchants who specialized in coming to the grasslands to engage in usury.

The people of Inner Mongolia have long demanded the construction of their own industry. This demand can only be realized in the era under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In recent years, under the unified plan of the Central People's Government, and with the help of fraternal nationalities, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government and the people of the entire region have diligently cultivated talent, accumulated funds, and overcome various difficulties with their own hard work, finally building more than 200 local state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-run industrial and mining enterprises on the original very weak industrial base. These include thirteen enterprises covering electricity, coal, dairy products, leather, bricks and tiles, and textiles. Some of these industries serve state-owned industries and support national basic construction; most of them directly serve the production and life of herdsmen and farmers.

The dairy industry and the fur industry have a close relationship with the lives and production of herdsmen and have received enthusiastic support from herdsmen, so they have developed relatively quickly. The local state-owned Hailar Dairy Factory was only a semi-mechanized factory with 30 employees when it was built in 1950, but now it is a factory with more than 120 employees and relatively new machinery and equipment; the total output value has also increased more than six times; and the products have also increased to include lactose and milk powder (originally only cream and casein). In recent years, the dairy processing plants operated by cooperatives have grown from eight to thirty-two, and the number of employees has increased from dozens to more than seven hundred, and the distribution area has expanded from one league to four leagues. In 1953, the total value of milk purchased by the entire dairy industry was more than 13 billion yuan, of which milk sold by herdsmen accounted for 60 percent. This means that last year, herdsmen increased their income by more than 7 billion yuan due to the sale of milk. In the past, a lot of the milk squeezed by many herdsmen was damaged and wasted in large quantities because they could not eat it all themselves, and it could not be processed using scientific methods. Now, some herdsmen can maintain or improve their lives and increase production just by selling milk. A local dairy cow produces more than 200,000 yuan of milk per year; an improved breed dairy cow produces more than 2 million yuan of milk per year. Herdsmen gratefully said: "Dairy processing plants are so good! In the past, milk was worthless; now we sell milk, and we have food and clothing, and we can develop production. Chairman Mao and the People's Government are really thinking of us in every way."

The lactose, casein, cream, and milk powder produced by dairy processing plants are supplied to all parts of the country. The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory used lactose produced in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to manufacture a large number of valuable medicines - penicillin; casein is an important raw material for the chemical industry and the manufacture of plywood and soundproof boards. Zhao Yingxia from the Changsha Cooperative School in Hunan wrote to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Dairy Industry Company and said: "Your milk powder brings great happiness to our children."

The Inner Mongolia dairy industry has broad prospects for development. Under the unified plan of the Central Government, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is planning to produce a large amount of lactose. It is estimated that in one or two years, the dairy industry will develop two or three times.

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also has eleven small and medium-sized fur factories. The Hailar Tannery and the Baotou Tannery both have modern equipment and can produce dozens of leather products such as leather boots and horse gear for herdsmen. In the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, they used their own products to support the most beloved people. The Hailar Fur Factory can produce tanned leather and manufacture a large number of felt shoes, felt lumps, and felt for yurts needed by the people of Inner Mongolia. The other nine small factories are scattered in various leagues and banners, manufacturing various small fur products for the local people.

In agricultural areas, there are twelve small and medium-sized farm tool factories. Most of them were newly built after liberation. In the past few years, they have manufactured a large number of plows, hoes, and sickles for farmers after the land reform, and generally achieved "guaranteed use and guaranteed exchange." With the development of agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, these factories are manufacturing large-scale farm tools and new-style farm tools. Woolen mills and oil pressing plants supply clothing and cooking oil for herdsmen and farmers.

Now, the state has decided to build a large-scale heavy industry base in Inner Mongolia. The construction of this heavy industry base will fundamentally change the economic landscape of Inner Mongolia. The local industry in Inner Mongolia will also greatly develop itself in supporting the construction of this base.

This year, the planned targets for local industry in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have been greatly increased compared to last year. In order to strive to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the annual planned tasks, the Inner Mongolia Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee specially issued instructions at the end of August, requiring party committees at all levels to strengthen specific leadership over enterprises, strengthen ideological work in enterprises, and call on all employees to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions to comprehensively fulfill the plan and strive to overfulfill the plan. All employees will, as in the past, work hard to realize the party's call.

    为牧民、农民服务的内蒙古地方工业
    内蒙古自治区人民政府工业部部长  权星垣
    内蒙古自治区有一千八百多万头牲畜，出产大量皮毛；也有耕地出产粮食，按全区农业人口计算，平均每人每年可得粮食一千斤以上。在解放以前，这个地区很少有为牧民和农民制造生产资料和生活资料的工业，牧民们不得不忍痛低价出卖自己的畜产品，高价购买所需要的工业产品，忍受着那些专门到草地来高利盘剥牧民的商人的残酷剥削。
    内蒙古人民早就要求建设自己的工业。这个要求，只有在中国共产党领导的时代才能实现。几年来，在中央人民政府的统一计划下，在各兄弟民族的帮助下，内蒙古自治区人民政府和全区人民兢兢业业地培养人才，积累资金，用自己辛勤的劳动，克服种种困难，终于在原有的非常薄弱的工业基础上建设了大小二百多个地方国营、公私合营及合作社营的工矿企业。其中包括电力、煤炭、乳品、皮革、砖瓦、纺织等十三个企业。这些工业，有的是为国营工业服务，支援国家基本建设的；大部分是直接为牧民和农民的生产和生活服务的。
    乳品工业和皮毛工业同牧民的生活和生产有着密切的关系，得到牧民的热烈支持，所以发展比较快。地方国营海拉尔乳品化工厂在一九五○年建设时，只是一个有三十个职工的半机械化的工厂，而现在已经是一个有一百二十多个职工，有较新的机器设备的工厂了；生产总值也增加了六倍以上；产品也增加了乳糖和乳粉（原来只有奶油和酪胶）。几年来，合作社经营的乳品加工厂由八个发展到三十二个，职工由几十人增加到七百多人，分布地区也由一个盟扩大到四个盟。一九五三年全部乳品工业收购的牛奶共值一百三十多亿元，其中牧民出售的牛奶占百分之六十。这就是说，去年牧民因出售牛奶而增加了七十多亿元的收入。过去，不少牧民挤的牛奶因自己吃不了，又不能用科学的方法加工处理，就大量的损坏和浪费掉了。现在，有些牧民只靠出售牛奶就可以维持或改善生活，提高生产。一头本地乳牛出产的牛奶，每年可得二十多万元；一头改良种乳牛出产的牛奶，每年可得二百多万元。牧民感激地说：“牛奶加工厂多好啊！过去牛奶不值钱；现在卖了奶，有吃又有穿，又能发展生产。毛主席和人民政府真是处处为我们着想。”
    乳品加工厂出产的乳糖、酪胶、奶油和乳粉，供应着全国各地。上海制药厂用内蒙古自治区出产的乳糖制造了大量的贵重药品—青霉素；酪胶是化学工业和制造胶合板、隔音板的重要原料。湖南长沙合作学校赵英霞给内蒙古自治区乳品工业公司来信说：“你们的乳粉，给我们的儿童带来很大的幸福。”
    内蒙古乳品工业有着广阔的发展前途。在中央的统一计划下，内蒙古自治区正计划生产大量乳糖。估计在一、二年内，乳品工业将有两三倍的发展。
    内蒙古自治区还有十一个中小型皮毛工厂。海拉尔制革厂和包头制革厂都具有现代设备，能生产牧民用的皮靴、马具等数十种皮革制品。在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，它们曾用自己的产品支援最可爱的人。海拉尔皮毛工厂能生产熟皮和大量制造内蒙人民需用的毡鞋、毡疙疸和做蒙古包用的毡。其它九个小型工厂都分散在各盟、旗里，为当地人民制造各种小型的皮毛制品。
    在农业区，有十二个中、小型农具工厂。它们绝大部分都是解放后新建的。前几年，它们为土地改革后的农民大量制造了犁、锄和镰刀，并一般地做到了“保用保换”。随着农业生产和互助合作运动的发展，这些工厂正制造大型的农具和新式农具。毛织厂和榨油厂供应着牧民、农民的衣料和食油。
    现在，国家已决定在内蒙古地区建设一个规模巨大的重工业基地。这个重工业基地的建设，将根本改变内蒙古地区的经济面貌。内蒙古地方工业在支援这个基地的建设中，也将使自己有很大的发展。
    今年内蒙古自治区地方工业的计划指标比去年大大提高了。为了争取全面完成和超额完成全年计划任务，中共中央内蒙古分局特于八月底发出指示，要求各级党委加强对企业的具体领导，加强企业中的思想工作，号召全体职工以全面完成计划和争取超额完成计划的实际行动来支援解放台湾。全体职工将和过去一样，为实现党的号召而努力。
