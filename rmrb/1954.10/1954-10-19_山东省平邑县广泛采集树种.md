    Pingyi County, Shandong Province, Widely Collects Tree Seeds
    In order to prepare sufficient tree seeds for future afforestation and seedling cultivation, Pingyi County, Shandong Province, plans to collect 62,000 jin of large-grain tree seeds and 37,000 jin of small-grain tree seeds this autumn, based on the county's tree seed production situation. In addition to specific arrangements made at the district production assistant meeting, the county has also organized four working groups to go deep into key seed-producing areas such as Sikai Mountain and Tianbao Mountain to assist in seed collection work.
    Currently, various tree seeds are mostly mature, and the masses in mountainous areas are widely carrying out seed collection work.

    山东省平邑县为了给今后造林、育苗准备充足的树种，根据全县树种出产情况，计划今年秋季采集大粒树种六万二千斤，小粒树种三万七千斤。该县除在区生产助理员会议上作了具体布置外，还组织了四个工作组深入四开山、天宝山等重点产种区协助进行采种工作。
    目前各种树木种子大都成熟，山区群众正广泛地开展采种工作。
