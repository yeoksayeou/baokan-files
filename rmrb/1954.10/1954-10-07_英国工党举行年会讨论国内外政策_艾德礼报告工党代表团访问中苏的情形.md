Xinhua News Agency, Skarbaro, October 5th: The 53rd annual conference of the British Labour Party, which opened in Skarbaro, England on September 27th, closed on October 1st.

The Labour Party's annual conference discussed the Labour Party's domestic and foreign policies, focusing on the rearmament of West Germany, the Southeast Asia military aggression treaty, the conscription law, and colonial policy.

This Labour Party annual conference was held under the following circumstances: On the one hand, the international situation is trending towards relaxation; on the other hand, imperialist war forces are trying their best to piece together military blocs in Asia and Europe, attempting to create and maintain a tense situation. The struggle between these two lines is reflected in the discussions on various agenda items of the Labour Party's annual conference.

When the Labour Party's annual conference discussed the Labour Party's foreign policy, the broad masses of people's desire for major powers to consult and ease international tensions after the Geneva Conference was reflected. The annual conference passed two proposals put forward by the Labour Party's Sicklerton organization and the Electrical Workers' Union by a majority vote, advocating that the British government hold talks with the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union in order to eliminate differences and discuss the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament issues.

Member of Parliament Davis and Firefighters Union Chairman Burns put forward proposals condemning the Southeast Asia military aggression treaty. During the discussion of these two proposals, the ordinary Labour Party members who participated in the discussion firmly opposed the Southeast Asia military alliance. Although these two proposals were not passed due to the obstruction of the right-wing leadership, the affirmative votes still totaled more than 4 million, accounting for more than half of all collective members and individual members.

The struggle surrounding the German question was the most intense struggle at the annual conference. Because the Labour Party National Executive Committee was afraid that its policy of arming West Germany would be rejected by the annual conference, it hastily passed a special resolution advocating the arming of West Germany on the eve of the opening of the annual conference in order to submit it to the annual conference for approval. During the discussion of the German question at the annual conference, despite the Labour Party's right-wing leaders' best efforts to defend the policy of arming West Germany, and despite the National Executive Committee's tight control of the venue, the proposal put forward by the Chairman of the Foundry Workers' Union opposing the arming of West Germany received enthusiastic support at the annual conference. The General Secretary of the National Union of Railway Workers, Member of Parliament Parkin and Hughes, and representatives of many local organizations of the Labour Party spoke out against the arming of West Germany. Their speeches repeatedly won warm applause, while speeches supporting the arming of West Germany were repeatedly interrupted by shouts and jeers opposing the arming of West Germany. Finally, only by relying on behind-the-scenes activities and pressure, the National Executive Committee collected a very weak majority vote for its special resolution advocating the arming of West Germany. The voting results actually showed that the broad masses of Labour Party members were very disgusted with the Labour Party leaders' policy of advocating the arming of West Germany and opposed the British government's and the United States' agreement on the issue of arming West Germany.

During the discussion of domestic policies, a struggle unfolded around the issue of the conscription law. This struggle showed that the broad masses of Labour Party members opposed the British government's undertaking so-called "new obligations" for "European defense" in order to lure France into agreeing to the arming of West Germany. The Amalgamated Engineering Union put forward a proposal requesting that national military service be shortened from two years to twelve months, and requesting that conscripted soldiers be kept within the territory of the United Kingdom. The Surrey party organization believed that "in the current international situation, there is no reason" for conscription. The Algiers party organization even demanded the complete abolition of national military service. Finally, the National Executive Committee, seeing that the situation was not good, forced the conference to hand over the conscription law issue to the National Executive Committee for decision, thereby stifling these proposals.

During the discussion of colonial issues, the National Executive Committee put forward colonial policy principles: supporting the British army's suppression of the national liberation movements in Malaya and Kenya; supporting the sham autonomy in the Gold Coast and Nigeria; and maintaining British rule over East Africa and Central Africa. These principles were criticized by the representatives. The East Harrow organization put forward a proposal arguing that the British authorities' policy of suppressing the colonies was "a threat to world peace." Representatives of other local organizations demanded an end to the implementation of racial discrimination policies in the colonies, and demanded that the British army withdraw from Malaya, Kenya, and other colonies. The National Executive Committee had to exert pressure again, causing the annual conference to reject the proposal to withdraw troops from the colonies, and to hand over some other proposals to the National Executive Committee for review.

In this way, this Labour Party annual conference hastily ended the discussion of important domestic and foreign policy issues.

Xinhua News Agency, Skarbaro: British Labour Party leader Attlee spoke on September 27th during the British Labour Party's annual conference's debate on foreign policy, reporting on the Labour Party delegation's recent visit to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and also discussed general political issues.

Attlee said: It was "absolutely right for the Labour Party to accept the invitation to send a delegation to visit the Soviet Union and China, because it is necessary to understand the views of people who disagree with you."

Attlee then talked about the Labour Party delegation's visit to the Soviet Union, saying that in "completely frank talks" with the Soviet leaders, the delegation members came to the conclusion that "there are absolute differences in ideology." However, Attlee said: This must never lead to the conclusion that "we cannot live on one earth."

Attlee then talked about the Labour Party delegation's visit to China. He said: The Chinese government has the support of the broad masses of people. For the first time, the Chinese have a clean government. They have done some excellent work in public health. They have swept away the dirt of past evils. They have begun to give hope to the peasants, and they are making great efforts to educate the Chinese people. This government is China's effective government today.

Attlee believes that "the People's Republic of China should obtain legitimate status in the United Nations." He said: "It is extremely absurd that those representing the Chinese in the United Nations are the few remaining remnants, rather than the messengers of the Chinese people. The originally planned United Nations was not an organization against communist countries. If only one type of people are allowed in the United Nations, it will become a tool of one side of the divided world."

However, Attlee, proceeding from his own prejudices, insisted that "there is a dictatorial government in China." Then, disregarding the fact that the People's Republic of China has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, he intentionally insinuated whether the Chinese revolutionary movement "will turn into imperialism? Will it seek to extend its power to the entire Southeast Asia?" Attlee believes that "no one knows this." Moreover, he then disregarded the Chinese government's peaceful sincerity and deliberately said that the "huge pressure" of China's population may press outwards.

Attlee also talked about the Taiwan issue. He said: "Undoubtedly, the Chinese people feel very indignant about the Taiwan issue, and I think they are justified." Attlee said: "Taiwan should return to China." But Attlee believes that this should be "after a period of time." Attlee did not explain what he meant by "after a period of time," nor did he explain whether he had abandoned his so-called "neutralization of Taiwan" proposal, which was resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. However, it was noted that Phillips, who came to China with Attlee, was still talking about what should be done to "neutralize" Taiwan.

When talking about general political issues, Attlee cautiously criticized the US-masterminded interference in Guatemala, believing that the United Nations has a responsibility to prevent aggression from any place, and that it is necessary to investigate the Guatemala incident. Attlee also cautiously criticized the Southeast Asia military alliance. He said: "We should not try to establish an organization that opposes Europeans and Asians. Neither the North Atlantic Alliance nor the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are perfect. Their emergence is the result of the current tense international situation." Attlee believes that it is absolutely necessary to hold a meeting of the highest-level representatives of the major powers, believing that this is more important than anything else, and believes that efforts should be made to eliminate the threat of hydrogen bombs.

### 英国工党举行年会讨论国内外政策  艾德礼报告工党代表团访问中苏的情形

    英国工党举行年会讨论国内外政策
    艾德礼报告工党代表团访问中苏的情形
   【新华社五日讯】斯卡巴罗消息：九月二十七日在英国斯卡巴罗开幕的英国工党第五十三届年会，已经在十月一日闭幕。
    本届工党年会讨论了工党的内外政策，其中着重讨论了重新武装西德、东南亚军事侵略条约、征兵法及殖民政策等问题。
    本届工党年会是在这样的情况下举行的：一方面，国际形势趋向缓和，另一方面，帝国主义战争势力却竭力在亚洲和欧洲拼凑军事集团，企图制造和维持紧张局势。这两条路线的斗争反映在工党年会各项议程的讨论上。
    在工党年会讨论工党外交政策时，日内瓦会议后广大人民要求大国协商以缓和国际局势的愿望得到了反应。年会以多数票通过了工党西克拉顿组织和电气工会提出的两个提案，主张英国政府和美国、苏联领袖举行会谈，以便消除分歧，并且讨论禁止原子武器及裁减军备问题。
    议员戴维斯和救火员工会主席伯恩斯提出了谴责东南亚军事侵略条约的提案。在讨论这两个提案时，参加讨论的工党普通党员坚决反对东南亚军事同盟。后来这两个提案虽然因右翼领导机构的阻挠而没有通过，但是赞成票仍然共有四百多万，占全部集体党员和个人党员半数以上。
    环绕着德国问题而展开的斗争，是年会上最激烈的斗争。工党全国执行委员会因为害怕它的武装西德的政策会遭到年会拒绝，就在年会开幕前夕匆忙通过一个主张武装西德的特别决议案，以便提交年会盖章批准。在年会讨论德国问题时，尽管工党右翼领袖竭力为武装西德的政策辩护，尽管全国执行委员会严密控制会场，但是翻砂工人联合会主席提出的反对武装西德的提案在年会上获得热烈的拥护。全国铁路工人工会总书记、议员帕金和休斯以及工党许多地方组织的代表，都发言反对武装西德。他们的发言一再赢得了热烈的掌声，而拥护武装西德的发言却一再被反对武装西德的口号声和讥笑声打断。最后，仅只靠了幕后活动和压力，全国执行委员会才为它的主张武装西德的特别决议案搜集到非常微弱的多数票。表决结果实际上说明了广大工党党员十分厌恶工党领袖主张武装西德的政策，并且反对英国政府和美国在武装西德的问题上的协议。
    在讨论内政政策时，环绕着征兵法的问题展开了一场斗争。这场斗争表明：工党广大党员反对英国政府为了诱骗法国同意武装西德而对所谓“欧洲防务”承担“新义务”。混合机械工业工会提出了
  一个提案，要求把国民兵役从两年缩短到十二个月，并且要求使应征入伍的士兵留在英国境内。萨利的党组织认为“在目前国际局势下没有理由”征兵。阿尔基尔的党组织甚至要求根本废除国民兵役。最后，全国执行委员会看见情势不好，迫使大会把征兵法问题交给全国执行委员会去决定，从而扼杀了这些提案。
    在讨论殖民地问题时，全国执行委员会提出了殖民政策原则：支持英国军队镇压马来亚和怯尼亚的民族解放运动；赞成在黄金海岸和尼日利亚的虚伪自治；保持英国对东非洲和中非洲的统治。这些原则受到了代表的抨击。东哈劳组织提出一个提案，认为英国当局镇压殖民地的政策是“对世界和平的威胁”。其他一些地方组织的代表要求停止在殖民地实行种族歧视政策，并且要求英国军队撤出马来亚、怯尼亚及其他殖民地。全国执行委员会只好再度施加压力，使年会拒绝了把军队撤离殖民地的提案，而把其他一些提案交给全国执行委员会审查。
    这样，本届工党年会就草草地结束了有关重要内外政策问题的讨论。
   【新华社讯】英国斯卡巴罗消息：英国工党领袖艾德礼二十七日在英国工党年会辩论外交政策时发言，报告了工党代表团最近在苏联和中华人民共和国的访问，并且谈到了一般政治问题。
    艾德礼说：工党接受邀请派代表团访问苏联和中国是“绝对正确的，因为，了解和你意见不同的人们的观点是必要的”。
    艾德礼接着谈到工党代表团访问苏联的情况说，在和苏联领袖们的“完全开诚布公的谈话”中，代表团团员得出这样的看法：在“思想上存在着绝对的分歧”。不过，艾德礼说：绝不能因此就认为“我们不能生活在一个地球上”。
    艾德礼然后谈到工党代表团在中国的访问。他说：中国政府得到广大人民的支持。中国人第一次有了一个廉洁的政府。他们在公共卫生方面做了一些出色的工作。他们已经扫除了以往的罪恶的污垢。他们已经开始给农民以希望，他们正在作出巨大的努力来教育中国人民。这个政府是中国今天的有效的政府。
    艾德礼认为“中华人民共和国应当在联合国中获得合法地位”。他说：“在联合国中代表中国人的是寥寥无几的残余分子，而不是中国人民群众的使者，这种情况是极端荒谬的。原先策划的联合国并不是一个反对共产主义国家的组织。如果只让联合国中有一类人的话，它将成为陷于分裂的世界一方的工具。”
    但是，艾德礼从他自己的偏见出发，硬说什么
  “在中国是一个独裁的政府。”接着，他又不顾中华人民共和国一贯奉行和平外交政策的事实，有意影射地问中国革命运动“是否会变为帝国主义的？它是否会图谋把它的势力伸展到整个东南亚？”艾德礼认为“这是谁也不知道的。”而且，他接着又漠视中国政府的和平诚意，故意说，中国人口的“巨大压力”可能向外进逼。
    艾德礼还谈到台湾问题。他说：“无疑地，中国人民在台湾问题上感到非常愤慨，我认为他们是有理由的。”艾德礼说：“台湾应该重归中国”。但是艾德礼认为这要“在一个时期以后”。艾德礼没有说明所谓“在一个时期以后”是什么意思，他也没有说明他是否已经放弃了他那个受到中国人民坚决反对的所谓“台湾中立化”的主张。但是，人们注意到，和艾德礼同来中国的菲利普斯却仍然在讲什么应该使台湾“中立化”。
    艾德礼谈到一般政治问题时，谨慎地批评了美国所主使的对危地马拉的干涉，认为联合国有职责防止从任何地方产生的侵略，并且认为有必要调查危地马拉事件。艾德礼也谨慎地批评了东南亚军事联盟。他说：“我们不应当设法建立一种使欧洲人和亚洲人对立的组织。北大西洋联盟和东南亚条约组织都不是完善的。它们的产生是当前国际局势紧张的结果。”艾德礼认为完全有必要举行大国最高级代表的会议，认为这是比任何事情都重要的事，并且认为应该努力消除氢弹的威胁。
