Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 8th: The United Nations General Assembly at its afternoon meeting on October 6 discussed the recommendations of the General Committee regarding the inclusion of two new items proposed by the Soviet delegation on the agenda of the Assembly, namely: "On the Conclusion of an International Convention (Treaty) on the Reduction of Armaments and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, Hydrogen Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction" and "On the Infringement of Freedom of Navigation in the Seas off China." As previously reported, the decision adopted by the General Committee recommended including the first item on the agenda while temporarily postponing the inclusion of the second item.

    The Soviet representative Vyshinsky stated that the General Committee's decision to postpone for a few days the discussion on whether to include our proposed item on the infringement of freedom of navigation in the seas off China on the agenda of the Assembly is incorrect, as it has no legal or political basis. Our delegation proposed this item because the piratical attacks and detention of merchant ships flying flags of various countries in the seas off China by Chiang Kai-shek's warships have recently become more frequent.

    Vyshinsky mentioned the incident of the seizure of the Soviet tanker "Tuapse" and the incident of the seizure of the Polish merchant ship "President Gottwald." He also mentioned some incidents of attacks on merchant ships of other countries, such as the attack on the British freighter "Haifa," another British ship "Rosita" (whose captain was killed), and the Dutch merchant ship "Henrik Janzon." Vyshinsky said that these facts show that the Soviet Union has raised a series of criminal acts that seriously undermine the universally recognized principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas, and the Assembly should resolutely condemn this crime. Since those responsible for these actions include not only Chiang Kai-shek's elements, but also those who instigate them, the Assembly should all the more resolutely condemn this crime.

    Vyshinsky continued: Precisely for this reason, the grounds put forward by the General Committee for recommending a delay of several days in discussing the inclusion of this item on the agenda are untenable. The grounds put forward for this recommendation are that negotiations regarding the "Tuapse" tanker are underway with the mediation of the French government. However, the issue raised by the Soviet delegation is by no means limited to a specific ship or a specific incident. The issue we have raised is of a much more general nature and of far greater principled significance. This issue involves a planned behavior that can only be described as acts of piracy against merchant ships on the high seas. Obviously, we cannot agree to the recommendation of the General Committee. We can only interpret this recommendation as an unwillingness to truly stop this behavior, and an unwillingness to bring to the attention of the United Nations General Assembly the fact that such lawless behavior has occurred on the high seas. The Soviet delegation insists on rescinding the recommendation of the General Committee.

    The Soviet representative's views were supported by the representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia.

    The Kuomintang elements, as in the meeting of the General Committee, once again moved to postpone the discussion of the question of including the aforementioned item on the agenda, on the grounds that France and the Kuomintang are negotiating on the "Tuapse" tanker issue.

    The United Nations General Assembly decided to postpone the discussion of this issue. Forty delegations voted in favor of this decision, six delegations including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and India voted against, and seven delegations including Burma and Syria abstained.

    The Assembly decided by fifty-five votes to include the item "On the Conclusion of an International Convention (Treaty) on the Reduction of Armaments and the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons, Hydrogen Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction" on the agenda of this session of the Assembly. Not a single delegation voted against or abstained.

    联合国大会通过将苏联裁军建议列入议程
    维辛斯基向大会发言斥蒋匪侵犯航行自由
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社纽约八日讯：联合国大会十月六日下午会议讨论了总务委员会提出的关于把苏联代表团提出的两个新项目列入大会议程的建议，这两个新项目就是：“关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约（条约）”和“关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”。前已报道，总务委员会通过的决定建议把第一个项目列入议程，暂时不把第二个项目列入议程。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言说，总务委员会的决定建议延迟几天讨论是否把我们提出的关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由的项目列入大会议程，我们的代表团认为这个决定是不正确的，因为它没有任何法理或政治的根据。我们的代表团所以提出这个项目，是因为蒋介石军舰在中国海面对悬挂各国旗帜的商船进行海盗袭击、并扣留这些船只的行为，最近变得更加频繁了。
    维辛斯基提到劫夺苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的事件和劫夺波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德总统号”的事件。他还提到一些袭击其他国家商船的事件，如袭击英国货轮“海发号”、另一艘英国船“罗西塔号”（这只船的船长被击毙）以及荷兰商船“亨里克·真逊号”的事件。维辛斯基说，这些事实说明，苏联提出了一系列的罪恶行为问题，这些罪恶行为严重地破坏了公认的公海航行自由的原则，大会应该坚决谴责这一罪行。由于要对这些行动负责的人不仅有蒋介石分子，而且还有那些怂恿他们的人，因此，大会也就更加应该坚决谴责这一罪行。
    维辛斯基接着说：正因为这样，总务委员会建议延迟几天讨论把这个项目列入议程所持的理由是站不住脚的。这种建议所持的理由是，在法国政府的调停下，关于“图阿普斯号”油船的谈判正在进行中。然而苏联代表团提出的问题绝不是限于某一只船，或是某一件具体的事件。我们提出的问题具有普遍得多的性质，具有大得多的原则性意义。这个问题牵涉一种有计划的行为，这种行为只能称为对公海上商船进行海盗袭击的行为。显然，我们不能同意总务委员会的建议。我们只能把这种建议解释作不愿意真正制止这种行为，不愿意促使联合国大会注意这样一个事实：在公海上发生了这样一种无法无天的行为。苏联代表团坚持取消总务委员会的建议。
    苏联代表的意见得到了波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表的支持。
    国民党分子像在总务委员会会议上一样，又动议延期讨论把上述项目列入议程问题，理由是法国和国民党正在就“图阿普斯号”油船问题进行谈判。
    联合国大会决定延期讨论这个问题。有四十个代表团投票赞成这个决定，苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和印度等六个代表团投反对票，缅甸和叙利亚等七个代表团弃权。
    大会以五十五票决定把“关于缔结一项裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的国际公约（条约）”项目列入大会本届会议议程。没有一个代表团投反对票或弃权。
