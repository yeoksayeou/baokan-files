Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who was invited by the Chinese government to visit our country, held a press conference on the afternoon of October 26th. Prime Minister Nehru issued the following statement at the meeting:

    During my short stay in Beijing and other parts of China, I have often spoken in public. I would like to repeat what I have said before to the press, and express my gratitude for the warm and friendly welcome I have received here. I believe that my visit to China, though short, will not only help to bring our two countries closer together, but will also contribute to the cause of world peace cherished by both of our countries.

    Peace is the fundamental basis for us to make progress in our respective countries. Therefore, peace is not only our devout wish, but also an absolute necessity.

    Both of our countries are engaged in the great cause of raising the living standards of hundreds of millions of people, making them all full beneficiaries of freedom and prosperity. This is a great task. We have firmly embarked on the road to this goal, and I am fully confident that we will continue to move forward along this path. In some respects, our problems are the same, and the conditions we must face are similar. Therefore, we can learn a lot from each other.

    I hope that the ties between the two countries will develop in many ways. It is important for us to understand each other. In today's world, it is inappropriate for any country to close itself off, and it is also out of step with the major developments that have already taken place. Obstacles between countries should be removed so that free exchanges can take place and promote understanding between countries. For this purpose, we Indians not only hope to be helpful to China, but also hope to be helpful to other places. I would like to extend my greetings to the Chinese people and bless them. I express my deepest gratitude to the government of the People's Republic of China for its generous hospitality. Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of this government, is a historical figure with great achievements.

    I have heard reports from some newspapers in London and New York that during the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and me, there were sharp differences between us. These reports are completely unfounded. Although there are some differences in the basic attitudes of India and China on certain issues, there were no disagreements in our talks, and I am very happy to say that there is a great degree of agreement.

    Prime Minister Nehru also answered some questions raised by reporters at today's press conference.

    Prime Minister Nehru elaborated on his views on Sino-Indian friendly relations. He said: "India is certainly extremely eager for peace to be maintained and consolidated, and China is also eager for that, so people can cooperate in many ways to promote its realization."

    Prime Minister Nehru also said: "We have always believed that, from many points of view, especially from the important point of view of world peace, it is necessary for China to participate in the United Nations."

    A reporter asked about his views on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Prime Minister Nehru said, "The five principles are excellent," and said: The problem is the problem of implementing these five principles.

    He said, "The first thing will be that different countries interact with each other, that is to say, the obstacles between them should be removed, and they should interact directly with each other."

    A reporter asked about the impact of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty on the situation promoted by the Geneva Conference. Prime Minister Nehru said that the Geneva Conference "is an excellent example of people with different views gathering together to seek a solution." Prime Minister Nehru said that the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty hinders the atmosphere of gathering together to resolve differences, "is an obstacle in this sense," and "aggravates tensions."

    Regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, Prime Minister Nehru said, "The first step is to maintain the Geneva Conference discussing the Korean issue, that is to say, we should not treat it as if it has ended in Geneva, but that this issue is still to be discussed and will continue to be discussed." He believes that at an appropriate time, further discussions among the countries concerned can lead to a solution.

    Prime Minister Nehru said that holding an Asian-African conference would help promote peace, and said that the details of this conference are still to be decided by the Colombo countries.

    When talking about the Indochina issue, Prime Minister Nehru said: The International Commission is working well, and the past decisions of the International Commission, which includes India, Canada, and Poland, have been unanimously adopted.

    Prime Minister Nehru said that his impression of his meeting with President Ho Chi Minh was that Ho Chi Minh was not only a peace-loving person, but also a very lovable and friendly person.

    More than 50 reporters from China, India, and various countries in Beijing attended the reception.

    尼赫鲁总理举行记者招待会并发表声明
    【新华社二十六日讯】应中国政府邀请来我国访问的印度总理尼赫鲁在十月二十六日下午举行了记者招待会。尼赫鲁总理在会上发表的声明如下：
    在我在北京和中国其他地方停留的短短几天中，我常常在公开场合讲话。我愿意把我以前说过的话再向报界讲一遍，并且对我在这里受到的热烈的友好的欢迎表示感谢。我相信，我在中国的访问，为期虽短，却不仅有助于促使我们两国关系更加密切，而且也有助于我们两国所珍视的世界和平的事业。
    和平是我们想要在我们各自的国家里取得进展的根本基础。因此，和平不仅是我们的虔诚愿望，而且是一种绝对的必需品。
    我们两国都在从事提高千百万人民的生活水平，使得他们都成为自由和繁荣的充分享有者这样一个伟大事业。这是一个伟大的任务。我们已坚定地走上通向这一目标的道路，我完全相信我们将沿着这条道路继续前进。在有些方面，我们的问题是相同的，我们所必须正视的条件也是相似的。因此，我们可以互相学习很多东西。
    我希望两国之间的联系在许多方面发展起来。我们相互了解是很重要的。在今天的世界上，对任何国家来说，闭关自守都是不相宜的，也是同已经发生的重大事态发展不协调的。各国之间的障碍应当消除，以便自由的交往能够进行，并促进各国之间的认识和了解。为了这个目的，我们印度人不仅希望对中国有所帮助，而且希望对其他地方有所帮助。我谨向中国人民致意，并祝福他们。对中华人民共和国政府的优厚招待，我表示最深切的谢意，这个政府的、受人民爱戴的领袖毛主席是一个有着伟大成就的历史人物。
    我听说伦敦和纽约的某些报纸消息说，在周恩来总理同我的会谈过程中，我们之间有尖锐的分歧。这些消息是完全没有根据的。虽然在某些问题上印度的基本态度同中国的基本态度有一些不同，但是在我们的会谈中并没有发生过分歧，而且我能很愉快地说，有很大程度的一致。
    尼赫鲁总理在今天的记者招待会上还回答了记者们提出的一些问题。
    尼赫鲁总理阐释了他对中印友好关系的看法。他说：“印度当然极为渴望和平得到维持和巩固，中国也渴望那样，因此人们可以在许多方面进行合作，以促其实现。”
    尼赫鲁总理又说：“我们一向认为，从许多观点来看，特别是从世界和平这一重要观点来看，让中国参加联合国是必要的。”
    有记者问到他对和平共处的五项原则的看法。尼赫鲁总理说：“这五项原则好极了”，并且说：问题是实施这五项原则的问题。
    他说，“首要的事情将是，不同的国家彼此交往，那就是说，它们之间的障碍应予消除，它们应该彼此直接交往。”
    有记者问到东南亚集体防务条约对日内瓦会议所促成的局势的影响。尼赫鲁总理说，日内瓦会议“是持有不同看法的人们共聚一堂，求出一个解决办法的极好的例子”。尼赫鲁总理说，东南亚集体防务条约妨碍共聚一堂解决分歧的空气，“在这个意义上说来是一种障碍”，而且“加剧了紧张局势”。
    关于和平解决朝鲜问题，尼赫鲁总理说，“第一个步骤是使得讨论朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议维持下去，那就是说，我们不应该把它当作好像已在日内瓦结束了，而是这个问题仍有待讨论，而且将继续予以讨论。”他认为，在适当时机，有关各国举行进一步的讨论，将可以求得一个解决办法。
    尼赫鲁总理说，举行亚非会议会有助于促进和平，并说，关于这个会议的细节仍有待于科伦坡国家作出决定。
    谈到印度支那问题的时候，尼赫鲁总理说：国际委员会工作得很好，由印度、加拿大、波兰参加的国际委员会过去的决定都是一致通过的。
    尼赫鲁总理在谈到他同胡志明主席会见时候所得的印象是：胡志明不但是一个维护和平的人，而且是非常可爱和友好的人。
    参加招待会的有中国、印度和各国在北京的记者五十多人。
