    Activities of People's Representatives in Various Parts of Liaoning Province
    Zhang Panxin
    The people's representatives elected in the general election in Liaoning Province are all advanced figures who have close ties with the people and are warmly supported by them. They have a high degree of political awareness and boundless loyalty to the people's cause. After being elected, they worked even more actively and created many ways to connect with the masses and serve the people in different work positions and according to different conditions. These methods mainly include the following:
    1. Establish people's representative groups according to region and occupation, and establish systems for meetings, reports, and study, so as to regularly study work, exchange experience, and learn policies and laws. Most districts in Shenyang City have established such organizations; the nine people's representatives in Taochang Street, Beishi District, have insisted on a regular meeting system since the day the representative group was established. In the past six months, this group has collected more than 140 urgent problems to be solved from the people, handled more than 30 of them, and the rest have been transferred to relevant departments and have been properly handled. The Hengyang Street group in Heping District divided the responsibility areas for contacting voters according to the nature of the representatives' work and the region (divided into agencies, streets, and enterprises). When encountering major problems, the representatives promptly studied them together to achieve organic cooperation. After the closing of the District People's Congress, this group immediately studied the content and focus of the transmission based on the resolutions of the Congress and the actual situation of the street, which not only enriched the content of the transmission, but also enabled the representatives to learn transmission methods.
    2. Hold voter symposiums, where people's representatives make publicity reports to voters. Before the convening of the People's Congress, conduct in-depth publicity on the central topics of the Congress and collect proposals in conjunction. In July of this year, the representatives of Tiexi District, Shenyang City, collected about 300 proposals through this form. Representative Mo Xirong held two symposiums in the electoral district, and the voters raised more than 70 suggestions. After the People's Congress meeting, the people's representatives also used this form to convey the resolutions of the Congress and the government work report to the voters. Gong Zhiyuan, a people's representative of Lingqian District, Dalian City, with the assistance of grassroots cadres, convened a voter meeting to convey the resolutions of the District People's Congress in conjunction with publicizing the general line.
    3. Establish "Voter Reception Day." This is a way to strengthen the connection between representatives and voters without affecting the representatives' production and work. Each representative can determine the day to receive voters according to their own working hours. Generally, it is on Sunday. Sheng Lixiang, a people's representative in Dalian City, because of busy production, cannot often receive voters, so he determined his holiday as "Voter Reception Day." Yu Zhanhai, a people's representative in Heping District, Shenyang City, also works in the agency. Because he is busy with work, he cannot receive voters on weekdays, so he takes time on Sundays or after work to receive voters. The roof of an old lady in the sixth residential group of Heping District was damaged by the real estate company when repairing the house, and it leaked every time it rained. This matter was delayed for a long time and was not resolved. Yu Zhanhai reflected the old lady's opinion to the real estate company, and in a few days, the real estate company repaired her house.
    4. Set up "Voter Message Book" and "Opinion Book" so that voters can leave their opinions when the representative is not at home. This form is mostly adopted by representatives of factories, mines, enterprises, and agencies. For example, People's Representative Zhang Rongxian is a worker at the Dalian Equipment Factory. The reason why he can often contact voters is because he set up a "Voter Message Book." One day, five employees wrote their opinions in the message book. Afterwards, he reflected the opinions to the government, the factory, and other units, and they were resolved. Liu Xiangge, a people's representative of Tiexi District, Shenyang City, and director of the fourth workshop of Shenyang Machinery No. 2 Factory, set up an "Opinion Book" in the workshop and often collected opinions from workers. According to the opinions put forward by the employees, the factory improved production leadership and working methods, increased production efficiency, and reduced casualties.
    5. Individual visits. This form is mostly adopted by street residents and rural women representatives. For example, after Zhao Songqiu, a people's representative in Heping District, Shenyang City, was elected, she took the initiative to obtain the help of the police station's household registration staff and civil affairs cadres, formulated a plan to visit voters, often went deep into the masses, understood the voters' demands and difficulties, and helped solve them in time. One day, she went to the 18th residential group, and the masses reported that the chimney of Yichang Iron Factory was too low, and sparks were emitted every day, so nearby residents did not dare to open the windows. So she immediately raised her opinion to Yichang Iron Factory, and in less than a week, the chimney of Yichang Iron Factory was raised. In three months, she visited a total of 550 voter households, accounting for more than 90% of the voter households in the electoral district, and collected more than 180 proposals. Sun Litian, a people's representative of Lingqian District, Dalian City, contacted voters at any time in his work position, collected 19 opinions on production in three months, and solved some production problems; in his spare time, he visited more than 500 voter households in a door-to-door manner and collected 56 opinions.
    Because the people's representatives try their best to actively contact voters and help the masses overcome difficulties, they are more supported by the people. The activities of the people's representatives in all aspects have played a great role in promoting the country's various tasks.
    Through the training and education of previous democratic life, the people's representatives have greatly improved their political awareness and sense of responsibility as masters, and fully realized that the country's affairs are their own affairs, the things the government wants to do are also the things they want to do, and the reason why everyone's affairs need everyone to do them. Therefore, they are very concerned about the country's affairs, lead the masses with exemplary actions, implement the resolutions of the People's Congress and the government's policies and laws, respond to the government's call, and cherish the country's property. For example, Zhang Yuzhou, a people's representative of Laoyemiao Village, Fengcheng County, found that the railway was destroyed by water. If it was not repaired immediately, the train would be in danger. He immediately reported it to the village government and organized more than 40 people to repair the railway in the rain. Xie Shuxiang, a people's representative of Ershili Village, Jin County, responded to the government's call for increasing production and practicing economy, and first carried out the experiment of "pulling off the roots and whiskers" in her own cotton field to make the cotton bloom earlier, so that each plant produced three more peaches and each mu produced 30 jin more of seed cotton. She led the broad masses to do the same, which increased the village's seed cotton production by 9,000 jin. After the People's Congress of Dadong Village, Fengcheng County, made a resolution on improving technology and increasing yield, the representatives took the lead in implementing the resolution, increasing the yield per mu by 20 jin of grain. The area planted with corn using new technology and dense planting accounted for 92.8% of the village's corn planting area, an increase of 13.6 times compared with last year. After the meeting of the People's Congress of Workers in Ping'an Mine, Fuxin City, they actively conveyed the resolutions to the voters, which improved the workers' sense of responsibility. They increased production by tapping potential, finding tricks, and improving technology. Sun Dehe, a worker representative of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, reported to the Party branch after the meeting of the People's Congress. With the support of the Party and government leaders, he convened a meeting of cadres above the level of Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League group leaders in the workshop and a forum for veteran technicians. He found that the failure to complete the task in March was due to lax mechanical maintenance and frequent accidents. He formulated five maintenance systems. After these systems were implemented, not only did the situation in which the workshop failed to complete the task in March was changed, but also the plan was overfulfilled by 120% in May, increasing the crushing capacity by 60% on the original level.
    The people's representatives often reflect the opinions and demands of the people, which not only solves the problems of the masses in a timely manner, but also concentrates the wisdom of the people and improves leadership and work. Cui Lianhe, a people's representative in Nanshi District, Shenyang City, is a teacher at Shenyang No. 7 Middle School. He is very busy with his work. In addition to preparing lessons, teaching, and grading homework every day, he also goes to students' homes to visit on Sundays. Even so, he does not relax his responsibilities as a people's representative, closely contact voters, and actively collect proposals. When encountering problems that the masses do not understand, he patiently explains them. For example, when the masses raised the issue that some students cannot be promoted to higher schools at present, he explained the government's policy of running schools to the masses. The 174 people's representatives elected in Nanshi District, Shenyang City, collected more than 5,140 proposals in a very short period of time. From December 1953 to August 1954, the people's representatives of Tiexi District, Shenyang City, collected a total of 7,430 proposals. Most of the proposals are constructive opinions. For example, the employees of Shenyang Wire Factory put forward problems and solutions in the quality and design of the factory's products. After implementation, the state's production increase task was completed, and the state's production was increased by more than 21.59 billion yuan. From Xiaoran Lane on Nanyi Road to Shandong Temple Street in Nanshi District, there is a long stinking ditch. Every time it rains, this street becomes a mud pit, which seriously threatens the health of local residents. During the puppet Manchurian period, this ditch also drowned children. After the general election movement in 1953, the people's representatives reflected this situation to the People's Congress. After discussion, the meeting decided to fill in this ditch. Not long after the meeting closed, this stinking ditch that had harmed the people for many years was turned into an avenue. For example, in 1952, the workers and masses in Tiexi District, Shenyang City, urgently demanded the extension of the tram station. After the people's representatives reflected it to the meeting of the People's Congress, the Congress made a resolution to extend the line by one station. After the line was repaired, it was very convenient for workers to go to and from work, which guaranteed the workers' production time.
    The people's representatives have played the role of supervising the government's work and the style of cadres, and improved the efficiency of the government's work. In Datouwan and Cheng'angbao villages in Anshan City, the meetings of the People's Congress can fully promote democracy every time. The representatives freely criticized the government's work and the style of cadres, and the government can seriously and properly handle the criticisms after the meeting. The representatives can also widely organize the masses to criticize the shortcomings in the government's work and the style of cadres. Before the convening of the People's Congress of Erdaofang Village, Bianmen District, Fengcheng County, the representatives collected 20 proposals from the masses criticizing and suggesting that the government improve its work, including criticisms of the government's procrastination in handling problems, the cooperative selling adulterated wine, the district health center's lack of concern for patients, and the highway bureau's failure to pay attention to economy. The government immediately transferred these opinions to the relevant departments for handling; the relevant cadres made self-criticisms at the village People's Congress. At the first meeting of the First People's Congress of Ji'an County (now划归 Jilin Province), the people's representatives criticized the bank, supply and marketing cooperative, and other units for improper loans, out-of-stock farm implements, and insufficient soybean cake feed. After the meeting, the County Finance and Economics Committee immediately convened a meeting of relevant financial and economic enterprise departments to study the criticisms raised by the people's representatives and decided to allocate 80% of the annual supply of soybean cake to ensure supply. The bank, supply and marketing cooperative, and other units also conducted inspections and decided to issue 793 million yuan of loans to farmers in March; the supply and marketing cooperative also quickly determined the loan recipients and lent 100 carts and 50 horses to farmers as soon as possible.

    辽宁省各地人民代表的活动
    张盘新
    辽宁省各地在普选中产生的人民代表都是和人民有密切联系，受到人民热烈拥护的先进人物。他们有着高度的政治觉悟和对人民事业的无限忠诚。他们在当选后，工作更加积极，并在不同的工作岗位上，根据不同条件，创造了很多联系群众、为人民服务的工作方法。这些方法主要有以下几种。
    一、按地区和职业建立人民代表小组，订立会议、汇报、学习等制度，经常研究工作，交流经验、学习政策法令。沈阳市各区大部都建立了这种组织；北市区洮昌街九名人民代表，从成立代表小组那天起，就坚持了例会制度。这个小组半年来从人民群众中共搜集了一百四十多件急待解决的问题，处理了三十多件，其余的转到有关部门，也都得到了妥善处理。和平区衡阳街小组，根据代表工作性质和地区，划分了联系选民的责任区域（分机关、街道、企业），遇到较大的问题，代表们及时共同研究，做到有机配合。区人民代表大会闭幕后，这个小组即根据大会决议，结合本街情况，研究传达内容和重点，这样既充实了传达内容，又使代表学会了传达方法。
    二、召开选民座谈会，由人民代表向选民作宣传报告。在人民代表大会会议召开之前，深入宣传大会中心议题，结合搜集提案。今年七月间，沈阳市铁西区代表们通过这种形式搜集的提案就有三百件左右。代表莫锡荣在选区内召开两次座谈会，选民提出了七十多条意见。在代表大会会议结束后，人民代表也同样运用这种形式，向选民传达大会决议和政府工作报告。旅大市岭前区人民代表宫志远在基层干部协助下，召开选民会，结合宣传总路线，传达了区人民代表大会决议。
    三、建立“选民接待日”。这是在不影响代表生产、工作的情况下，加强代表和选民联系的一种形式。每个代表可以根据自己的工作时间，自行确定接待选民的日子。一般都是在星期天。旅大市人民代表盛立祥，因为生产忙，不能经常接待选民，他便确定自己的假日为“选民接待日”。沈阳市和平区人民代表于占海在机关里工作，也因为工作忙，平时不能接待选民，他便抽出星期天或下班后的时间接待选民。和平区第六居民组一位老大娘住的房顶被房产公司修理房子时扒坏了，每逢下雨就漏水。这事拖了很久也没有得到解决。于占海把这位老大娘的意见反映给房产公司，不几天房产公司就把她的房子修好了。
    四、设立“选民留言簿”和“意见簿”，以便选民来访而代表不在家时把意见留下。这种形式多是厂矿企业和机关团体等单位的代表采用的。如人民代表张荣贤，是旅大器材厂工人，他所以能经常联系选民，就是因为设立了“选民留言簿”；有一天就有五名职工在留言簿上写下意见，事后他把意见分别反映到政府、工厂等单位，并得到解决。沈阳市铁西区人民代表、沈阳机械二厂第四车间主任刘向阁，他在车间设立了“意见簿”，经常搜集工人群众的意见。该厂根据职工提出的意见，改进了生产领导和工作方法，提高了生产效率，减少了伤亡事故。
    五、个别访问。采用这种形式的多是街道居民和农村妇女代表。如沈阳市和平区人民代表赵松秋当选后，主动取得了派出所户籍员、民政干事的帮助，订立了访问选民计划，经常深入群众，了解选民要求和困难，并及时帮助解决。有一天她到十八居民组，群众反映怡昌铁工厂烟囱太低，天天冒火星子，附近居民不敢打开窗户。于是她马上向怡昌铁工厂提出意见，不到一星期，怡昌铁工厂的烟囱便修高了。她在三个月中，共访问选民五百五十户，占本选区选民户数的百分之九十以上，搜集提案一百八十多件。旅大市岭前区人民代表孙立田，在自己工作岗位上随时联系选民，三个月中搜集了十九件有关生产上的意见，解决了一些生产上的问题；业余时间他又以串门方式访问了五百多户选民，搜集了五十六件意见。
    由于人民代表想尽各种办法积极联系选民，帮助群众克服困难，因而更加受到人民群众的拥护。人民代表各方面的活动对国家各项工作起了很大的推动作用。
    人民代表经过历次民主生活的锻炼和教育，政治觉悟和主人翁的自觉性大为提高，充分认识到国家的事就是自己的事，政府要办的事，也就是自己要办的事，以及大家的事需要大家办的道理，所以，他们对国家的事情非常关心，以模范行动带动群众，贯彻人民代表大会决议和政府的政策法令，响应政府的号召，爱护国家的财产。如凤城县老爷庙村人民代表张玉周，发现铁路被水冲毁，如不立刻修好，火车就会出险，他立刻报告村政府，组织群众四十多人，冒着大雨修好铁路。金县二十里村人民代表谢淑香，响应政府增产节约的号召，首先在自己棉田里进行“拔断根须”的试验，使棉花早开絮，这样每棵多开三个桃，每亩多产三十斤籽棉。她带动了广大群众都这样做，使全村增产籽棉九千斤。凤城县大东村人民代表大会会议做出改良技术、提高产量措施的决议后，代表带头贯彻决议，使每亩地增产二十斤粮食，全村苞米按新技术密植的占全村种植苞米面积的百分之九十二点八，比去年增加了十三点六倍。阜新市平安矿工人代表在人民代表大会会议后，积极向选民传达决议，提高了职工们的责任感，通过挖潜力找窍门、改进技术等办法，增加了生产。鞍山市钢铁公司工人代表孙德和，在人民代表大会会议后，向党支部做了汇报，在党政领导支持下，召开了车间党、政、工、团小组长以上的干部会和老技术工人座谈会，检查出过去因为机械检修不严，事故多，影响生产，订出了五项检修制度，这些制度执行后，不但改变了本车间三月份未完成任务的情况，而且在五月份又超额完成计划百分之一百二十，使破碎能力在原有水平上提高了百分之六十。
    人民代表经常反映人民群众的意见和要求，不仅及时解决了群众的问题，而且能集中人民群众的智慧，改进领导和工作。沈阳南市区人民代表崔连和，他是沈阳第七中学教员，工作很忙，每天除备课、上课、批改作业外，星期日还要到学生家去访问，就是这样，他还不放松人民代表的职责，密切联系选民，积极搜集提案，遇到群众不了解的问题，他就耐心解释。比如群众提出有的学生目前还不能升学的问题，他就向群众解释政府办学的方针。沈阳南市区选出的一百七十四名人民代表，在很短时间里就搜集了五千一百四十多件提案。从一九五三年十二月到一九五四年八月，沈阳铁西区人民代表共搜集了七千四百三十件提案。提案中绝大部分是建设性意见。像沈阳线材厂职工提出了厂内产品质量和设计等方面存在的问题和解决办法，实行之后，完成了国家增产任务，并给国家增产二百十五亿九千多万元。南市区南一马路晓然里到山东庙街，有很长一条臭水沟，每逢下雨，这条街就变成了泥塘，严重威胁着当地居民的健康。伪满时期，这条沟还淹死过小孩。一九五三年普选运动后，人民代表把这种情况反映到人民代表大会，经过会议讨论，决定把这条沟垫平。会议闭幕不久，这条危害人民多年的臭水沟便变成了大道。又如一九五二年沈阳铁西区职工群众迫切要求延长电车站，经人民代表反映到人民代表大会会议上，大会作出决议把线路延长一站。线路修好后，工人上下班非常便利，保证了工人的生产时间。
    人民代表发挥了监督政府工作和干部作风的作用，提高了政府工作效率。鞍山市达到湾、城昂堡等村，每次人民代表大会会议均能充分发扬民主，代表们畅所欲言地批评政府工作和干部作风，会后政府对批评意见并能作认真妥善的处理。代表们并能广泛组织群众对政府工作和干部作风中的缺点提出批评。凤城县边门区二道坊村人民代表大会会议召开前，代表在群众中搜集了二十条批评、建议政府改进工作的提案，其中有批评政府处理问题拖拉、合作社卖酒掺水、区卫生所对患者不关心、公路局不注意节约等。政府立即把这些意见转有关部门处理；有关干部到村人民代表大会上作了检讨。辑安县（现已划归吉林省）首届人民代表大会第一次会议上，人民代表批评银行、供销社等单位贷款不当，农具脱销，豆饼饲料不足等，会后，县财经委员会立即召开了有关财经企业部门的会议，研究了人民代表提出的批评意见，决定调拨全年供应量百分之八十的豆饼，以保证供应。银行、供销社等单位也都作了检查，并决定三月份把七亿九千三百万元的贷款发到农民手里；供销社也迅速确定贷款对象，把一百台大车和五十匹马早日贷给农民。
