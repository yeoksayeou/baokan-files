The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued instructions to the Civil Affairs Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Civil Affairs Departments of the People's Governments of all provinces, and the Civil Affairs Bureaus of the People's Governments of municipalities directly under the Central Government regarding the continued evaluation and rewarding of exemplary martyrs' family members, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized construction soldiers, and exemplary models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to their families.

The instructions stated: Since the Ministry issued instructions on July 11, 1952, regarding the evaluation of exemplary martyrs' family members, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized construction soldiers, and exemplary models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to their families, all localities have widely carried out this work. Experience over the past few years has proven that commending exemplary individuals and establishing benchmarks is a very important method for promoting preferential treatment work. However, some regions currently do not pay enough attention to cultivating exemplary individuals, have insufficient grasp of exemplary materials, and, in particular, do not do enough to use these exemplary cases to educate the vast number of martyrs' family members, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized construction soldiers, and the masses of people. Therefore, the work of evaluating and rewarding exemplary models of preferential treatment must continue to be emphasized and improved.

The instructions require all localities to conduct a serious evaluation of exemplary individuals at the county and city level after this year's autumn harvest, in conjunction with the inspection and summary of preferential treatment work. In areas severely affected by floods, this should be carried out in conjunction with production and disaster relief work, if conditions permit. The conditions for evaluating exemplary individuals should take into account all aspects, such as production, work, compliance with government policies and laws, and flood prevention and emergency rescue. For martyrs' family members, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, the main focus should be on evaluating those who actively respond to the government's call and actively participate in production (especially participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas), or those who have new inventions or creations in production positions as technical innovators (labor models and technical innovators in cities or industrial and mining enterprises). Among the masses, the rural focus should be on mutual aid and cooperative organizations that actively help martyrs' family members and military dependents participate in production; the urban focus should be on agencies, organizations, and enterprises that actively recruit martyrs' family members, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in work, or actively educate and help them in production and progress.

The instructions concluded: The focus of evaluating and rewarding exemplary models of preferential treatment work is at the county and city level. The county and city model representative conferences must be well organized. We should, through investigation and research, inspect our work and truly grasp the specific situations of activists and exemplary figures in subordinate districts and townships, strengthen their daily education and training, encourage them to consolidate their existing achievements, continue to carry forward their glory, closely connect with the masses, and play a backbone leading role. Only in this way can we make due preparations for the work of evaluating exemplary individuals; and only in this way can the exemplary models be consolidated and continuously developed and improved. The work of evaluating and rewarding exemplary individuals should be closely integrated with current work and should not be carried out in isolation simply for the sake of evaluation, temporarily piecing together numbers. Appropriate material rewards should be given to the exemplary models.

    内务部发出评选、奖励优抚模范工作的指示
    中华人民共和国内务部向内蒙古自治区人民政府民政部、各省人民政府民政厅、直辖市人民政府民政局发出关于继续开展评选、奖励烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人模范和拥军优属模范工作的指示。
    指示中说：自从本部在一九五二年七月十一日发出关于评选烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人模范和拥军优属模范的指示以来，各地都普遍地开展了这一工作。几年来的经验证明，表扬模范，树立旗帜，是推动优抚工作的一个很重要的方法。但目前有些地区对模范的培养还注意不够，对模范的材料也掌握得少，特别是运用这些模范事例来教育广大烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员建设军人和人民群众更做得不够。因此，评选和奖励优抚模范的工作必须继续予以重视和改进。
    指示要求各地在今年秋收以后，结合优抚工作的检查总结，以县、市为单位，认真地进行一次评选模范的工作。在遭受严重水灾的地区，如条件许可时，应当结合生产救灾工作进行。评选模范的条件，应该照顾到各个方面，如生产、工作、遵守政府政策法令、防汛抢险等。在烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人方面，主要应该是评选积极响应政府号召和积极参加生产
  （农村特别是参加互助合作运动）的人物，或者是在生产岗位上有新的发明、创造的技术革新者（城市或工矿企业的劳动模范与技术革新者）。在群众方面，农村主要应该是积极帮助烈属、军属参加生产的互助合作组织；城市主要应该是积极吸收烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加工作或者积极教育帮助他们生产和进步的机关、团体和企业单位。
    指示最后说：评选和奖励优抚模范工作的重点在县、市。县、市模范代表会议必须开好。应通过调查研究，检查工作，切实掌握所属区、乡积极分子和模范人物的具体情况，加强对他们日常的教育和培养，鼓励他们巩固现有成绩，继续发扬光荣，密切联系群众，发挥骨干带头作用，这才能为评选模范工作做好应有的准备；也只有这样才能使模范得到巩固，并不断发展和提高。评选和奖励模范的工作，要密切结合当前的工作进行，不能孤立地为评模而评模，临时强拉凑数。对模范们应当分别给予适当的物质奖励。
