    Persistent Labor, Brilliant Creation
    Zhao Feng
    The first performance of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble at the Huai Ren Tang in our capital gave us an unforgettable impression. Their outstanding performance demonstrated the excellent achievements of Soviet dance art, and their high artistic and technical level convincingly demonstrated that only through tireless and persistent labor can artistic creation reach such a height.
    The capital's artists had the opportunity to see the rehearsals of the Soviet Folk Dance Ensemble. They rehearse for five or six hours every day, and this rehearsal time is considered inviolable to the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble. It is through this uninterrupted rehearsal that the ensemble's performance reaches such a level of proficiency. The folk dance's unique, strong, and surprisingly fast rhythm requires extremely flexible bodies to adapt, which requires dancers to have extremely skilled techniques, requiring skill to arise from familiarity. The Ukrainian "Gopak-Kolo" dance concentratedly expresses the ensemble's high technical level. The whirlwind-like rhythm, accompanied by whirlwind-like dance steps, depicts the brave and heroic image of the Ukrainian people.
    The Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble, known as "messengers of friendship," performed dances from Korea, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Mongolia, and Hungary. The dancers captured the characteristics of the people of each nation, either vividly expressing the joyful youth of each nation's people, or realistically and simply expressing the scenes of each nation's life. What is particularly worthy of our gratitude is that our distinguished guests performed the Chinese Peking opera "San Cha Kou" and "Red Silk Dance." This on the one hand, shows the Soviet people's love for the Chinese people and Chinese art, and on the other hand, also shows the Soviet artists' brilliant creative talents. We know that the performance of Chinese Peking opera requires the actors' movements to be extremely rigorous and accurate, especially in repertoires like "San Cha Kou." However, the two main actors playing "San Cha Kou," Golovanov and Savin, amazingly performed the complex movements in the play. We should pay our respects to Savin, who played Liu Lihua, for successfully portraying this courageous, righteous, and warmly pleasing character. And the "Red Silk Dance" choreographed by Moiseyev can be said to be more concentrated and refined than our original choreography, movingly expressing the joy and fervor of the liberated people.
    "Guerrilla Fighters" (choreographed by Moiseyev) was a program warmly welcomed by the audience. The clever foot movements imitate the heroes riding on horseback, the fierce spinning of the brave female guerrilla fighter (played by Mozalyevskaya), and the moving portrayal of the life of the fighters, gives people great emotion.
    The "Summer Dance" (Courting) in the Russian group dance "Four Seasons" choreographed by Moiseyev, depicts the passionate side of the Russian people's character, the Belarusian "Potato" dance praises the joy and sacredness of labor life, and the Nanai people's combat skills (a duel between two young men) is performed by one person wrestling as two people, showing the dancer's unique skills. Regarding these successful performances, we must also mention the seamless cooperation of conductor and composer Gariberin and artists Rakov and Moiseyev. The ensemble's perfect orchestra and exquisite costumes are an integral part of the perfect dance performance.
    The successful performance of the Soviet National Folk Dance Ensemble shows that Soviet art has achieved brilliant achievements in all aspects. We have only seen the ensemble's first performance. In the next two months, the ensemble's performances in Beijing and across the country will provide us with more opportunities to learn.

    顽强的劳动，光辉的创造
    赵沨
    苏联国立民间舞蹈团，在我国首都怀仁堂的首次演出，给了我们难忘的印象。他们的卓越的演出，表现了苏维埃舞蹈艺术的优异成就，他们的高度艺术和技术水平，令人信服地说明了：只有通过不倦的、顽强的劳动，艺术创造才能达到那样的高度。
    首都的艺术工作者们有机会看到苏联民间舞蹈团的排演，他们每天要排演五六小时，而这排演的时间对苏联国立民间舞蹈团说来是神圣不可侵犯的。就是通过这从不间断的排演，舞蹈团的表演才达到这样的熟练程度。民间舞蹈特有的、强烈的、惊人快速的节奏，需要极灵活的身体才能适应，这就要求舞蹈者有极纯熟的技巧，要求熟中生巧。乌克兰“高帕克—柯洛”舞，便集中地表现了舞蹈团的高度技术水平。像狂风一样的节奏配着旋风似的舞步，刻划出乌克兰人民勇敢豪迈的形象。
    被称为“友谊的使者”的苏联国立民间舞蹈团，表演了朝鲜、波兰、罗马尼亚、斯洛伐克、蒙古和匈牙利的舞蹈，舞蹈家们抓住了各个民族的人民的特性，或者淋漓尽致地表现了各族人民愉快的青春，或者真实朴素地表现了各族人民生活的场景。特别值得我们感谢的是我们的贵宾们表演了我国的京剧“三岔口”和“红绸舞”，这一方面表示了苏维埃人民对中国人民和中国艺术的热爱，另一方面也显示了苏维埃艺术家的光辉的创造才能。我们知道，我国京剧的表演要求演员动作的极端严谨和准确，特别是“三岔口”这一类的剧目。但扮演“三岔口”的两个主要演员高洛万诺夫和萨文，令人惊叹地表演了剧中的繁复的动作。我们应该对饰演刘利华的萨文表示敬意，他成功地表演了这个见义勇为、热诚可喜的人物。而莫伊塞耶夫所排演的“红绸舞”，可以说比我们原来的编排更集中而精练，动人地表现了解放了的人民的喜悦和狂热。
    “游击队员”（莫伊塞耶夫排演）是被观众热烈欢迎的一个节目。巧妙的脚部动作模仿着骑在马上的英雄们，勇敢战斗的女游击队员（莫札列夫斯卡娅饰）的激烈的旋转，那动人的战士生活的描绘，给人以极大的感动。
    莫伊塞耶夫排演的俄罗斯组舞“四季”中的“夏舞”（求婚），描写了俄罗斯人民性格中热情奔放的一面，白俄罗斯“马铃薯”舞赞美了劳动生活的愉快和神圣，纳纳伊人的斗技（两个小伙子的角斗）由一个人扮两个人摔角，表现了舞者的特有的技巧。关于这些成功的演出，我们还不能不提出指挥家、作曲家加里别林和美术家拉柯夫和莫伊塞耶夫的无间的合作。舞蹈团的完美的乐队和精致的服装是完美的舞蹈表演的不可分割的部分。
    苏联国立民间舞蹈团的成功的演出，显示了苏维埃艺术在任何一方面都获得了辉煌的成就。我们才看到舞蹈团的首次演出，在今后二个月内，舞蹈团在北京和全国各地的演出，将会给我们提供更多的学习的机会。
