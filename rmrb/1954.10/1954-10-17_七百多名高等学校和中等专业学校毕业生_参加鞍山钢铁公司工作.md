Over Seven Hundred Graduates from Universities and Secondary Vocational Schools
Participate in Work at Anshan Iron and Steel Company

Xinhua News Agency

From August to early October this year, more than seven hundred graduates from dozens of universities and secondary vocational schools across the country came to Anshan Iron and Steel Company. After a short period of internship, they have now begun to participate in practical work. Some have even signed apprenticeship contracts and mutual assistance contracts with workers, foremen, and technicians, and have drawn up specific internship plans.

Most of the university students who came to Angang this time have specialized in detailed fields that meet the requirements of practical work, and they can basically achieve consistency between what they have learned and what they are applying, so they master their business relatively quickly. Many students were very excited when they learned that they were assigned to Anshan to participate in the construction of the motherland's first iron and steel base. As soon as they arrived at their work posts, they actively requested work and humbly learned from veteran technicians and workers. Dozens of young students assigned to the geology department set off with the field work team a few days after arriving at the geology department, carrying their luggage to participate in prospecting and exploration. Now, their footprints can be found everywhere on the Dagushan, Donganshan and other mines near Anshan. Students in charge of tunnel prospecting often enter and exit the tunnels with workers. Students working in the Ansteel steel casting workshop have already started working with the workers. They can actively help the workers with their work, take the initiative to learn from the workers, and often help the section chief with calculating production results and filling out forms. Liu Fangwen, who works in the Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company, graduated early from Dalian Institute of Technology in the first half of this year. Because he loves his work and often actively learns from the workers and uses his brains to come up with ideas, he was able to work independently in only two months.

    七百多名高等学校和中等专业学校毕业生
    参加鞍山钢铁公司工作
    今年八月至十月初，又有七百多名来自全国各地几十个大专学校和中等专业学校的毕业生来到了鞍山钢铁公司。他们经过一个短时期的实习后，目前已开始参加实际工作，有的还同工人、工长、技术人员订了师徒合同和互助合同，订出了具体的见习计划。
    这次来到鞍钢的大专学生大部分所学的专业分工细致，符合实际工作的要求，基本上能做到学用一致，因此，他们掌握业务也较快。很多学生知道自己分配到鞍山参加祖国第一个钢铁基地的建设时，都很兴奋。他们一到工作岗位上，就积极要求工作，主动、虚心地向老技术人员、工人学习。分配在地质处的几十个青年学生，到地质处几天就背着行李和野外工作队一起出发，参加勘察、探矿等工作去了。现在鞍山附近的大孤山、东鞍山等矿山上，到处都有他们的足迹，担任坑道探矿的学生，经常与工人一起出入在坑道中。在鞍钢铸钢车间工作的学生已经开始随着工人工作了。他们都能积极帮助工人干活，主动向工人学习，还经常帮着段长做计算生产成绩、填报表等工作。在工业筑炉工程公司工作的刘芳文，是今年上半年由大连工学院提前毕业的，由于他热爱工作，经常积极主动地向工人学习，开动脑筋想办法，只有两个月的时间就能独立工作了。（新华社）
