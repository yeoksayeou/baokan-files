Commanders and fighters of the ground, naval, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly endorse the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué.

Commanders and fighters of units stationed in Beijing were extremely excited upon hearing the good news of the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué from the radio and newspapers. Many units held discussion meetings to support the Communiqué. Chang Qing, a special-class merit recipient from a certain army unit, said during a discussion, "The declarations and communiqués issued after the Sino-Soviet government talks once again demonstrate that the Soviet government and people's assistance to us is comprehensive and selfless. It will further promote the faster and greater development of our country's construction." Sun Tengna, a second-class merit recipient from a naval directly subordinate organization, said, "This communiqué is of significant international importance because it will further promote peace in Asia and the world." Chen Dazheng from a naval unit, who was recently stationed in Lushunkou, excitedly said after learning about the Communiqué's content, "The Soviet Navy is a model for our naval construction. The Soviet army's withdrawal from the Lushunkou naval base and the transfer of the base for our complete control will greatly promote our naval construction. We must strengthen our work in all aspects and strive to liberate Taiwan."

The good news of the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué and the Soviet Union's gift of agricultural machinery and equipment greatly encouraged the commanders and fighters of various units in the East China Military Region. He Jinyi, a squad leader of a certain army unit guarding the coastal defense front line, immediately found a map after hearing the good news. Pointing to the vast area bordering China and the Soviet Union, he said, "The people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, have always been united like brothers. In the past, the Soviet government and people have consistently provided us with selfless assistance; now, as our national defense strength has grown, the Soviet government has opportunely handed over the Lushunkou military port to our country. This is the full trust of the people of China and the Soviet Union in our armed forces. We must be more vigilant in defending our national defense and never fail the trust of the people of our country and the Soviet Union!" Wu Chuqing, the deputy commander of a certain submarine who had just returned from a voyage, excitedly said, "The Soviet Navy is our role model. The Lushunkou military port, which was jointly used by the Soviet army and us, will become our model military port. We must learn from the Soviet Union, strengthen our maritime training, rapidly build a strong people's navy, liberate Taiwan, and defend our country's socialist construction." Zhou Kelin, the air force squadron leader who shot down a Chiang Kai-shek plane in the air battle on June 3rd this year, said excitedly while preparing to take off on a patrol mission, "With the selfless assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, we will surely be able to successfully complete and defend the great cause of socialist construction." The sailors of a certain warship, who, together with fraternal warships, shot down and damaged 14 Chiang Kai-shek planes and damaged 7 Chiang Kai-shek warships in the Dongji Islands battle in May this year, danced excitedly on the deck of the warship after hearing the good news, and then held a discussion. The East China Public Security Forces also held discussions. Lu Ying, a model worker from the second-level organ of the Public Security Forces, said at the discussion, "The selfless assistance of the Soviet big brother is another practical and profound internationalist education for us."

Many units in the Southwest Military Region and the Northwest Military Region held discussions, warmly endorsing the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué. Commanders and fighters believe that the Communiqué marks a higher stage in the friendly cooperative relationship between China and the Soviet Union based on common interests and aspirations. Leng Mingqing, a model worker from a certain unit in the Southwest Military Region, said, "The close unity and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union are one of the main conditions for our country's socialist construction and a reliable guarantee for consolidating peace in the Far East and the world. We must cherish this friendship and cooperation as we cherish the pupils of our eyes." Yu Zuyan from a certain unit in the Northwest Military Region said, "We guarantee to further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and defend our country's socialist construction to repay the sincere and great assistance given to us by the Soviet government and people."

The Volunteers
Commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers warmly endorse the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué.

On the 12th, the wired broadcasting station of the Chinese People's Volunteers leadership relayed the various communiqués on the Sino-Soviet talks broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing. Blackboards, wall newspapers, quick news, and position newspapers of many units published the full text of the various communiqués on that day. The company where Lu Changrong, a representative of the National People's Congress, was located, held a general assembly of all soldiers. When the political instructor read out the full text of the various communiqués at the meeting, all the soldiers in the company immediately cheered and sang songs praising Sino-Soviet friendship. After listening to the communiqué, the soldiers of a certain unit of the Volunteers on the west coast immediately opened the map to check the routes of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway and the Jining-Ulan Bator railway. The soldiers of the ninth company of a certain unit, who were helping Korean people with the autumn harvest on both sides of the Ai Shanjiang River, immediately launched a labor competition after listening to the communiqué. They proposed to support the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué with practical actions to help the Korean people restore construction.

Many units of the Volunteers held discussion meetings on the positions and in the barracks to support the Sino-Soviet Talks Communiqué. Second-class model Shen Xianhong said: "The Soviet people's great and selfless assistance to our country will accelerate the process of our country's socialist construction and also bring great confidence and strength to us peace-keeping soldiers." Lou Zhixing, the squad leader of a certain unit who has been awarded the third-class merit twice, carefully studied the part of the joint declaration of the Chinese and Soviet governments on the Korean issue. He said: "This fully reflects the will of peace-loving people all over the world. We must continue to work hard to strive for an early peaceful settlement of the Korean issue." Yu Hengsheng, a mechanical and electrical engineer of a certain tank unit who lives in Lushun-Dalian, introduced many deeds of the Soviet soldiers stationed in Lushunkou, who loved the people of our country, at the discussion. The soldiers of the first platoon of the second company of a certain coastal defense unit also collectively wrote a letter to the Soviet army stationed in Lushunkou to express their respect and gratitude. The troops stationed in Pingkang, Dingzishan, "Old Bald Mountain" and other areas and on the east coast also unanimously expressed their determination to work hard to learn from the advanced Soviet military science and the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people, continue to be vigilant, and jointly guard the position with the Korean People's Army, so as to strive for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, defend the socialist construction of the motherland, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.
