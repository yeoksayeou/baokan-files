Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 19th: The Indonesian newspaper "Dongxing Bao" opposes sabotage activities by colonial countries in Indonesia. It writes: "Foreigners are beginning to increasingly intensify their interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, with the aim of splitting the unity of the people and strengthening the position of foreign monopoly capital."

The newspaper continues: It is known that "foreign monopoly capital is attempting to eliminate the leaders of the Republic. Not long ago, a group of Dutch people were arrested. These arrests were necessary in order to thwart the plans to assassinate the leaders of the Republic of Indonesia."

The newspaper also said that now, the activities of Kuomintang elements appear to be particularly active.

The newspaper writes: "Kuomintang secret agents are not only carrying out sabotage activities in Indonesia, but also in Burma." Kuomintang elements are attempting to provoke a government crisis in Indonesia through bribery and intimidation, in order to form a cabinet that can recognize the Chiang Kai-shek regime.

The newspaper says: "We especially warn that there is now a conspiracy brewing against the independence of the Republic of Indonesia. Foreign agents want to remove President Sukarno, overthrow the Sastroamidjojo government, and eliminate the Republic."

The newspaper calls on the people to heighten their vigilance.

"Independent Newspaper" and "People's Daily" have also issued the same call to the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 13th: The Indonesian people and newspapers are demanding that strong measures be taken to stop the subversive activities carried out by Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang secret agents in Indonesia. Some new materials show that Kuomintang agents intend to overthrow the Republic of Indonesia.

Most of the newspapers published on the 13th pointed out that these agents are enemies of Indonesia. "Social Horn" and "Peace Daily" pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang elements are operating in Indonesia under the protection of the American Embassy in Jakarta.

These newspapers said that during the recent trade negotiations between Indonesia and the People's Republic of China, these Kuomintang elements were particularly active, attempting to sabotage the negotiations.

    外国垄断资本集团和蒋匪分子在印度尼西亚进行破坏活动
    印度尼西亚报纸号召人民提高警惕
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社雅加达十九日讯：印度尼西亚报纸“东星报”反对殖民国家在印度尼西亚进行破坏活动。它写道：“外国人开始越来越加紧干涉印度尼西亚的内政，目的是分裂人民的团结，并加强外国垄断资本的地位。”
    报纸继续写道：大家知道，“外国垄断资本企图消灭共和国的领导人员。不久之前，一批荷兰人曾经被逮捕。为了击破企图杀害印度尼西亚共和国领导人的计划，这些逮捕是必要的。”
    报纸还说，现在，国民党分子的活动显得特别活跃起来。
    报纸写道：“国民党特务不仅在印度尼西亚进行破坏活动，而且在缅甸进行破坏活动。”国民党分子企图用贿赂和恫吓的手段来挑起印度尼西亚的政府危机，以便成立一个能够承认蒋介石政权的内阁。
    报纸说：“我们特别提出警告：现在有反对印度尼西亚共和国独立的阴谋正在酝酿着。外国特务想排除苏加诺总统，推翻沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府，并消灭共和国。”
    报纸号召人民提高警惕。
    “独立报”和“人民日报”也向人民发出同样的号召。
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社雅加达十三日讯：印度尼西亚人民和报纸要求采取有力的措施以制止蒋介石国民党特务在印度尼西亚进行的颠覆活动。一些新的材料显示，国民党特务打算倾覆印度尼西亚共和国。
    十三日出版的报纸大多数都指这些特务是印度尼西亚的敌人。“社会号角报”和“和平日报”指出，蒋介石国民党分子正在雅加达的美国大使馆的庇护下在印度尼西亚进行活动。
    这些报纸说，在最近印度尼西亚和中华人民共和国举行贸易谈判期间，这些国民党分子格外活跃，企图破坏这个谈判。
