　　East China's state-run forest farms and nurseries have seen significant development. The region now has 104 forest farms, an increase of 57 over the past, with a total area of over 2.9 million mu, an expansion of 27 times over the past; there are 269 nurseries, an increase of 118 over the past, with a total area of over 20,000 mu, an expansion of more than four times over the past. The number of forestry workers in various forest farms and nurseries has also grown to more than 4,000. This spring, the forest farms and nurseries in the region produced more than 1 billion seedlings of various types, enough to afforest approximately 2.5 million mu. This year, the forest farms and nurseries have sown more than 15,000 mu of seedlings, which are now growing vigorously. It is estimated that next year they can produce more than 1.24 billion seedlings of coniferous and broad-leaved trees, which, at 400 trees per mu, can afforest a total of more than 3 million mu.
　　In recent years, the forests cultivated by various forest farms and nurseries have played a significant role in improving agricultural production and protecting water sources. The coastal protection forests cultivated in Huang County, Shandong Province, have played a role in preventing wind and sand damage. In the past two years, the yield of nearby farmland has increased by more than double. The forests of Laoshan Forest Farm were completely cut down by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits before liberation, which affected the water supply for the residents of Qingdao. After closing the mountains for afforestation, the dried-up water sources have been restored. After afforestation on the river beaches on both sides of the Yi River, it has not only prevented flooding but also deepened the riverbed and conserved water sources. After vigorous afforestation by the West Lake Forest Farm in Zhejiang Province, the West Lake mountainous area has restored its former lush forest landscape. (Chen Wusheng)

    华东国营林场和苗圃有发展
    华东区国营林场、苗圃有了显著发展。全区现有林场一百零四处，比过去增加了五十七处，面积共有二百九十多万亩，比过去扩大了二十七倍；苗圃二百六十九处，比过去增加了一百一十八处，面积共有二万多亩，比过去扩大了四倍多。各林场苗圃林业职工也发展到四千多人。今年春季全区各林场苗圃共生产了各种苗木十亿多株，约营造林二百五十多万亩。今年各林场苗圃又播种了一万五千多亩幼苗，现都生长旺盛，预计明年可产针、阔叶树苗十二亿四千多万株，以每亩植树四百株计算，共可造林三百多万亩。
    几年来各林场苗圃营造的森林，在提高农业生产、保护水源等方面都发挥了很大作用。山东省黄县营造的海岸防护林，已起到了防止风砂为害的作用，两年来附近农田的产量均增产一倍以上。崂山林场的森林，解放前被蒋匪帮全部砍光，以致影响了青岛市居民的生活水源，经过封山育林后，已使枯干的水源恢复起来，沂水两岸河滩造林后，不仅防止了洪水的泛滥，而且刷深了河床，涵养了水源。浙江省西湖林场经过大力育林造林后，已使西湖山区恢复了旧有的林木茂盛的景象。（陈午生）
