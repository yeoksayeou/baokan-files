The number of overseas Chinese students returning to the country is increasing year by year. Statistics from August 1954 show that the number of returned overseas Chinese students has increased more than tenfold compared to 1950. The regions they come from are also expanding, including Indonesia, Malaya, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, India, the Philippines, Japan, as well as Europe, Africa, and the Americas. A few overseas Chinese students have also returned from the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and North Korea.

The increasing number of returned overseas Chinese students is inseparable from the motherland's growing strength, unprecedented rise in international standing, the rising tide of patriotism among overseas Chinese, and the desire of overseas Chinese students for progress.

After returning to the motherland, overseas Chinese students, under the care of the state's education departments, have entered various levels of schools across the country after passing examinations. They receive the same care and cultivation from the state as their domestic counterparts.

In recent years, the Overseas Chinese Affairs departments and education departments have paid close attention to the reception, placement, education, and cultivation of returned overseas Chinese students, and have made certain achievements.

The vast majority of overseas Chinese students have no family to rely on in the country. After returning, they need to make up for courses. Those whose level is too low to be admitted to regular schools, or who return after the application deadlines, need to receive tutoring. These are difficulties they cannot solve on their own after returning to the country. To solve these difficulties, the People's Government's Overseas Chinese Affairs departments have established hostels and secondary remedial schools for returned overseas Chinese students in Beijing, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places, and have also established overseas Chinese student remedial classes in Shantou and Haikou, Guangdong, specifically for newly returned overseas Chinese students to make up for courses, serving as a bridge for them to apply for regular schools. With the continuous increase in the number of overseas Chinese students returning to the country, the People's Government, based on needs and possibilities, has successively built necessary school buildings in Beijing, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places, and established three secondary remedial schools for returned overseas Chinese students to uniformly handle the reception, cultural course tutoring, and distribution to regular schools for returned overseas Chinese students returning to Beijing, Guangdong, and Fujian. This has solved their difficulties in life and study before enrollment, and has also laid the foundation for further strengthening the work of returned overseas Chinese students in the future.

According to the state's educational construction plan and in conjunction with the actual situation of returned overseas Chinese students, in terms of entrance examinations, in addition to returned overseas Chinese students applying for higher education institutions participating in the unified national entrance examination for higher education institutions, those applying for secondary schools, starting from 1954, will be uniformly handled by the "Returned Overseas Chinese Students Applying for Secondary Schools Enrollment Committee" established in Guangzhou (it was handled in Guangzhou and Beijing in 1953). The admission standards will adopt a grade placement test method, and students will be placed in appropriate classes according to their actual level. Those whose level is too low will remain in the secondary remedial schools for returned overseas Chinese students for tutoring. In order to accommodate their inconsistent return times, they can have more opportunities for examinations. The age requirements for admission are also slightly broader than those for domestic students. In terms of distribution to schools, the placement will, to the extent possible given student capacity in different regions, appropriately take into account the living habits and climate preferences of overseas Chinese students, mainly placing them in colleges and universities in major cities in the Central South, East China, and North China regions, as well as in schools at all levels in the overseas Chinese hometowns of Guangdong and Fujian.

The purpose of these regulations is to be realistic, to adapt to the state's educational construction and talent cultivation plans, and at the same time to provide more comprehensive care for the situation of overseas Chinese students, striving to achieve proper placement.

The vast majority of returned overseas Chinese students rely on remittances from their families abroad to cover their learning and living expenses. However, some returned overseas Chinese students, such as those from the Philippines and Thailand, cannot obtain the necessary funds sent by their parents due to local government restrictions on overseas remittances. The education departments of the People's Government provide necessary care for some returned overseas Chinese students with financial difficulties, based on different situations. In addition to all returned overseas Chinese students studying in higher education institutions and secondary specialized schools receiving people's scholarships, those studying in ordinary middle schools can also enjoy people's scholarships like poor domestic students; special assistance is also provided to those with particular difficulties. Some overseas Chinese students recognize the significance of the state's call to "practice strict economy and increase production," and have themselves promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and solved some difficulties. This has solved the practical living problems of returned overseas Chinese students, so that their studies are not affected by economic difficulties. Returned overseas Chinese students generally can gradually develop a simple lifestyle together with domestic students. The phenomenon of extravagance and waste by individual returned overseas Chinese students can also be gradually overcome with the help of the school.

Because of the care and attention they receive from the state in all aspects, returned overseas Chinese students have expressed their determination to exercise well, study hard, and make themselves useful talents in the country's construction.

In recent years, overseas Chinese students who have been assigned to various regions have received the care and love of local Party committees, governments, and schools.

Returned overseas Chinese students are new to a learning environment, and due to their academic qualifications, they have difficulties in learning and are not accustomed to some aspects of life. Although most returned overseas Chinese students are relatively diligent, due to the fact that they studied abroad in the past, and the foreign education systems, courses, and textbooks are different from those in China, coupled with some initial language difficulties, they generally feel that their foundation is poor and they cannot keep up. This requires teachers and classmates to provide more help to them. In recent years, schools in various regions have adopted various forms of tutoring to help them with their homework. And in the learning process, they help them clarify the purpose of learning, establish a correct attitude towards learning, and overcome difficulties, prompting them to actively work hard and catch up with their studies. In terms of life, their health and living habits are also taken care of in all aspects of clothing, food, and housing.

With the country's training and education, overseas Chinese students are making rapid progress. Under the principle of implementing unified education and unified management, schools at all levels provide appropriate care for returned overseas Chinese students. As a result, returned overseas Chinese students generally achieve good health and good academic performance, and actively participate in recreational and sports activities.

Since last year, more and more returned overseas Chinese students have completed their studies and gone from schools to various construction positions in the motherland, participating in the construction work of the motherland's first five-year plan, and together with the people of the whole country, striving for the realization of a socialist society in the motherland's united and friendly big family.

    国家对归国华侨学生的照顾和培养
    石毅夫
    归国的华侨学生一年一年地增加。一九五四年八月统计，回国的华侨学生人数比一九五○年时增加了十多倍。包括的地区也越来越广，印度尼西亚、马来亚、泰国、越南、缅甸、印度、菲律宾、日本以及欧洲、非洲、美洲都有华侨学生回国。苏联、蒙古、朝鲜也有个别华侨学生回国。
    归国华侨学生所以逐年增多，这是和祖国日益强盛、国际地位空前提高、国外侨胞爱国热潮高涨，以及华侨学生要求进步分不开的。
    华侨学生回到祖国，在国家的教育部门的关照下，经过考试已分别进入国内各地各级学校。他们和国内同学一样，受到了国家的爱护和培养。
    几年来，侨务机关和教育部门对归国华侨学生的接待、安置、教育和培养是很注意的，并且做出了一定的成绩。
    华侨学生绝大多数在国内没有家庭依靠，回国以后还需要补习课程，程度低考不上正规学校的，或者是过了考期才回国的，都需要进行补习，这是他们回国以后本身无法解决的困难。为解决这些困难，人民政府的侨务部门在北京、广州、厦门等地设立了招待所和归国华侨学生中等补习学校，并且在广东汕头、海口等地设立了华侨学生补习班，专为新回国的华侨学生补习课程，成为归国华侨学生投考正规学校的桥梁。随着华侨学生回国人数的不断增加，人民政府根据需要和可能，先后在北京、广州、厦门等地建筑了必需的校舍，开办了三所归国华侨学生中等补习学校，统一办理回到北京、广东、福建的归国华侨学生的接待、文化课程补习以及分送正规学校等各项工作。这就使得他们在入学前生活上、学习上的困难获得了解决，同时也为今后进一步加强归国华侨学生工作打下了基础。
    根据国家教育建设计划，结合归国华侨学生的实际情况，在入学考试上，除了投考高等学校的归国华侨学生参加高等学校全国统一招生考试外，投考中等学校的，从一九五四年起，则由在广州成立的“归国华侨学生投考中等学校招生委员会”统一办理招生考试（一九五三年曾在广州和北京办理）。录取标准则采取编级测验的办法，根据实际程度编入适当班级，程度过低的则留在归国华侨学生中等补习学校补习。为了照顾他们回国时间不一致，考试次数可以有较为多次的机会。入学年龄的规定，也比国内学生略宽一些。在分送入学方面，根据各地区的学生容量尽可能地适当照顾华侨学生的生活习惯、气候等情况，主要安插在中南、华东、华北地区的大、中城市，以及广东、福建侨乡的各级学校。
    这些规定的目的，是为着实事求是，既适应国家教育建设和培养人材的计划，同时对华侨学生的情况也作比较全面的照顾，尽量做到妥善的安置。
    归国华侨学生绝大多数依靠国外家庭汇款接济，以自费解决其学习和生活费用。但是也有些归国华侨学生，如由菲律宾、泰国等地区归国的华侨学生，由于当地政府限制侨汇，得不到自己父母寄来的所必需的费用。人民政府的教育部门对于一部分经济上有困难的归国华侨学生，分别不同情况给予必要的照顾。除了在高等学校和中等专业学校学习的归国华侨学生全部享受人民助学金外，在普通中学学习的，也和国内贫苦同学一样，可以享受人民助学金；对特别困难的还另外给予必要的补助。有些华侨同学认识到国家号召“厉行节约、增加生产”的意义，自己发扬互助互济精神，也解决了一些困难。这样就解决了归国华侨学生切身的生活问题。使他们不致因经济困难而影响学习。归国华侨学生一般的都能和国内同学一起，逐步养成朴素的生活作风，个别归国华侨学生挥霍浪费的现象，在学校的帮助下，也能够逐步加以克服。
    归国华侨同学由于获得国家各方面的关怀和照顾，都纷纷表示入学后要好好锻炼身体、学好功课，使自己成为国家建设中的有用人材。
    几年来，被分配到各个地区入学的华侨学生都受到了当地党委、政府及学校的关怀和热爱。
    归国华侨学生新到一个学习环境，因学历程度关系，在学习上有困难，生活上也有不习惯的地方。虽然大部分归国华侨同学都比较用功，但由于过去在国外读书，国外的教育制度、课程、教材都和国内不同，再加上回国初期语言上的一些困难，所以他们普遍感到根基差，跟不上，这就需要老师、同学更多的去帮助他们。几年来，各地学校采取各种各样的辅导方式，对他们的课外作业进行帮助。并且在学习过程中帮助他们明确学习的目的，树立正确的学习态度和克服困难的精神，促使他们自己积极努力，赶上功课。在生活上，也从衣、食、住各方面照顾了他们的健康和生活习惯。
    华侨同学在国家的培养教育下，进步是很快的。各级学校在贯彻统一教育、统一管理的原则之下，对归国华侨学生加以适当照顾，结果归国华侨学生普遍地做到了身体好，学习好，并积极参加文娱和体育活动。
    从去年以来，越来越多的归国华侨学生完成了学习任务，从学校走上祖国各种建设岗位，参加了祖国的第一个五年计划中的建设工作，在祖国团结友爱的大家庭里，和全国人民一起，共同为社会主义社会的实现而奋斗。
