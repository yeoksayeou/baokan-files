    In Areas with Measly Pork, Pigsties and Human Toilets Should Be Separated
    Letter from the Department of Parasitology, Peking Union Medical College: Currently, in some areas of North China, Northeast China, and ethnic minority regions of Southwest China, the phenomenon of pigs suffering from cysticercosis (i.e., "measly pork") is very common. According to comrades responsible for inspection at the Beijing Slaughterhouse and responsible comrades of the Business Section of the Meat Supply Department of the Beijing Food Company, when purchasing pigs in rural areas of Hebei Province, the purchasing personnel can discover, by examining the pigs' tongues, that an average of 10% to 20% of the inspected pigs have measly pork (i.e., pork with cysticercosis). In individual areas such as Dingxing and Wangdu, the rate is as high as 30%, sometimes even reaching 70%. In the Northeast region, the rate is generally above 4%. Last year, the Beijing Slaughterhouse slaughtered a total of 481,058 pigs, and post-slaughter inspections revealed that 8,335 of them had measly pork.

    Pigs suffering from cysticercosis have small, soybean-sized cysts in their meat, resembling small blisters, containing a tiny white dot the size of a grain of rice, which is the head of the cysticercus. Porcine cysticercosis is caused by the eggs of the pork tapeworm entering the pig's body. The pork tapeworm is a parasite that specifically lives in the human small intestine, consisting of over a thousand segments. The segments at the rear end contain many eggs. These egg-containing segments detach and are excreted with human feces. After being eaten by pigs, they develop into cysticerci within two months, forming measly pork.

    However, human pork tapeworm disease is contracted by eating measly pork. It is very dangerous to use measly pork for cooking. When cutting the meat, many cysticercus heads fall onto the knife and cutting board. If the knife and cutting board are not cleaned thoroughly and are then used to cut vegetables, especially cooked or ready-to-eat foods, people can easily ingest these cysticercus heads and contract pork tapeworm disease. If measly pork is not cooked thoroughly, or if the meat slices are too thick and not fried completely, the cysticerci in the meat will not be killed, and people will also contract pork tapeworm disease.

    Generally speaking, there are no obvious discomforts associated with having pork tapeworms in the human small intestine. However, the serious issue is that people with tapeworm disease can easily contaminate their hands after defecation. If people ingest pork tapeworm eggs, they can also contract cysticercosis. Cysticerci growing in subcutaneous tissue or muscle is not too serious, but if they grow in the human brain, they can cause convulsions and death.

    To prevent pork tapeworm disease from spreading to more people, in addition to strengthening post-slaughter inspections in city slaughterhouses to prevent people from eating measly pork, people who have already contracted pork tapeworm disease should be treated to eliminate the source of tapeworm eggs. But the most important method is to separate pigsties from toilets, so that pigs do not develop cysticercosis, which will effectively eradicate pork tapeworm disease. In the vast majority of rural areas in North China, pigsties are combined with human toilets, and pigs always eat human feces. If human feces contain pork tapeworm eggs, the pigs will develop cysticercosis. Therefore, measly pork is more serious in North China than in other regions. In some ethnic minority areas of Southwest China, although pigsties are not combined with human toilets, people live on the upper floor and livestock live on the lower floor, and human latrines lead into the livestock sheds, so livestock can still eat human feces.

    Therefore, it is hoped that rural work cadres and health workers in areas with measly pork will conduct widespread publicity and education among farmers, explaining the causes of measly pork and the benefits of separating pigsties and toilets for people's health and the farmers themselves. To improve this popular but unscientific practice, we should first educate the Communist Party members, collective farm members, and agricultural production cooperative members in rural areas to take the lead, in order to influence the broad masses of farmers to actively find ways to separate toilets and pigsties.

### 有痘猪的地区应该把猪圈和人厕分开

    有痘猪的地区应该把猪圈和人厕分开
    北京中国协和医学院寄生物学系来信：目前华北、东北和西南有些少数民族地区，猪生猪肉囊虫病（即是猪米心子）的现象很普遍。据北京市屠宰场负责检验的同志及北京市食品公司肉食供应部业务股的负责同志谈，采买人员到河北省农村采购毛猪时，用检查猪舌的方法就发现被检查的毛猪中平均有百分之十到二十的猪是痘猪（就是长了猪米心子的猪），个别地区如定兴、望都等地竟高达百分之三十，有时甚至到百分之七十。东北地区一般在百分之四以上。去年北京市屠宰场共杀猪四十八万一千零五十八只，经宰后检查发现其中有八千三百三十五只是痘猪。
    患猪肉囊虫病的猪，肉里有一些黄豆粒大的囊状物，像一个个小水泡，里面含着一个小米粒大的白点，那就是囊虫的头。猪肉囊虫病是由于猪带条虫的卵进入猪体后而生的。猪带条虫是一种专门寄生在人小肠中的寄生虫，全身分一千多节，在后端的节里含有很多虫卵，这些含卵的节片脱落下来随同人的粪便排出，被猪吃下去以后经过两个月就长成为囊虫并形成痘猪。
    但人的猪带条虫病又是由于吃了痘猪的猪肉而得的。用痘猪肉来做菜是很危险的。切肉时很多囊虫头就落在菜刀和砧板上，如果菜刀和砧板没有洗净就用来切菜，特别是切已经煮熟和准备生吃的食物，人就很容易吃进这些囊虫头而得猪带条虫病。痘猪肉没有煮熟或者肉片太厚炸得不透，肉中的囊虫没有死，人吃了也会得猪带条虫病。
    人的小肠里有猪带条虫寄生，一般说来没有什么显著的不舒服。但是，严重的是有条虫病的人大便后很容易污染自己的手，如果人吃了猪带条虫的卵，也会得囊虫病。囊虫长在皮下组织或肌肉中还不太要紧，如果长在人脑子里就会抽疯而死亡。
    要防止猪带条虫病传染到更多的人，除了在城市的屠宰场里加强宰后检查，使人吃不着痘猪肉外，已经患了猪带条虫病的人应该进行治疗，以消灭条虫卵的来源；但最主要的方法是把猪圈和厕所分开，使猪不生囊虫病，才能有效的根绝猪带条虫病。在华北农村中极大多数的猪圈都和人的厕所合在一起，猪总是吃人的大便，如果人的大便中有猪带条虫卵，猪吃了就会生猪肉囊虫病，因此华北地区的痘猪比其他地区更严重。西南有些少数民族地区，猪圈虽然没有和人的厕所在一起，但人住在上面一层，牲畜住在下面一层，人的便所通入畜舍内，牲畜仍然可以吃到人的大便。
    因此，希望在有猪米心子的地区的农村工作干部和卫生工作人员，向农民普遍进行宣传教育，说明猪米心子发生的原因，猪圈和厕所分开对人民健康和农民自己的好处。为了改善这种带有群众性的不科学的习惯做法，首先应该教育农村中的共产党员、集体农庄庄员和农业生产合作社的社员们带头行动，以便影响广大农民群众积极设法把厕所和猪圈分开。
