   【新华社十日讯】东京消息：被美国氢弹杀害的日本渔船“福龙丸第五号”船员久保山爱吉的葬礼，九日在静冈县烧津市举行。当地和日本全国各地共五千多人参加了这个仪式。
    这个葬仪成为日本人民要求和平的示威。参加葬仪的有烧津市居民和来自全日本各地的人士。他们在到墓地的途中高呼禁止原子武器的口号。
    当天，在属于日本工会总评议会的国营铁道工会和日本教职员工会等三十八个工会组织发起下，全国各地许多工场、汽车和轮船上齐鸣汽笛，为久保山爱吉的下葬志哀。
    美国氢弹杀死久保山爱吉的事件，在日本各地引起了广泛的抗议和愤怒。从久保山死后，日本各地很多团体、个人和报纸，都纷纷写信或著文悼念久保山，谴责美国惨无人性地使用原子弹和氢弹的政策。
    日本共产党中央指导部在九月二十五日就久保山的逝世发表了声明，声明指出：久保山的死亡是美国执行使用氢弹进行战争的政策的必然结果。美国政府正在向人类与和平挑战。
    声明最后号召日本全国人民以各种形式，在全国范围内广泛展开要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的抗议运动，并指出这是在日本人民心中永远纪念久保山爱吉的办法。
