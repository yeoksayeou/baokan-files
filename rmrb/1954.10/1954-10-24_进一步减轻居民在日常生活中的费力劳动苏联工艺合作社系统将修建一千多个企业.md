    Further Reduce the Laborious Work of Residents in Daily Life
    The Soviet Industrial Cooperative System Will Build More Than 1,000 Enterprises
    【Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd】The Soviet industrial cooperative system will successively build 1,500 enterprises providing services for residents' lives in the two years of 1954 and 1955.
    In addition to producing daily necessities, another major business of the Soviet industrial cooperative is to serve the needs of the people's lives, in order to reduce the laborious work of residents in daily life. In 1953, the industrial cooperative system already had 61,000 enterprises providing services for residents' living needs, covering various repairs, laundry, and moving services.
    Many of these enterprises to be built successively in the coming two years are fully mechanized joint enterprises. They include several workshops and can repair clothing, furniture, metal products, etc. This year, a total of ten new chemical cleaning and dyeing enterprises will be completed, which can accept a large number of clothes every day. In addition, in the recent years, more than one hundred large sewing enterprises will be built to meet the needs of residents' individual orders. In rural areas, the demand for enterprises providing services for living needs has been increasing in recent years. To further meet this need, each district will establish such a joint enterprise.

    进一步减轻居民在日常生活中的费力劳动
    苏联工艺合作社系统将修建一千多个企业
    【新华社莫斯科二十二日电】苏联工艺合作社系统在一九五四年和一九五五年两年内将陆续修建一千五百个为居民生活服务的企业。
    苏联工艺合作社除生产日用品以外，另一主要业务是为人民的生活需要服务，以便减轻居民在日常生活中的费力劳动。一九五三年内，工艺合作社系统已有六万一千个为居民生活需要服务的企业，服务的范围包括各种修理工作、浆洗工作、搬运工作等。
    在今明两年内陆续建成的这些企业中，有许多是完全机械化的联合企业。它们包括好几个车间，可以修理衣着、家具、金属用品等等。今年内，共有十个新的化学洗染企业完工，每天都可接纳大量的衣服。此外，在最近几年内，还要建设一百多个大缝纫企业，以供接纳居民的个别订货的需要。在农村中，近年来对为生活需要服务的企业的要求日益增加。为进一步满足这方面的需要，各个区都要建立一个这样的联合企业。
