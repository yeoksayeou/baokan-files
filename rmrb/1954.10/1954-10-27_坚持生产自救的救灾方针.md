Adhere to the Disaster Relief Policy of Production for Self-Salvation

This year, some areas of our country suffered from extraordinarily heavy floods and prolonged waterlogging. Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people in the disaster areas waged a sustained struggle against the floods and achieved significant victories. However, due to the exceptional magnitude of this year's floods, high water levels, strong currents, early arrival, and late retreat, the extent and depth of the disaster generally exceeded those of the past few years. The floods not only affected the lives of millions of people in the disaster areas and caused certain damage to the country's economic construction, but also increased the task of production and disaster relief this year. Making every effort to do a good job in production and disaster relief in the disaster areas and striving to shorten the disaster period and reduce the extent of the disaster are the urgent tasks at hand.

How do we overcome the disaster? Some comrades hope that the state will provide a large amount of money to solve all the difficulties of the people in the disaster areas, which is incorrect. This year, the state has already allocated more money for disaster relief than in previous years. If we were to allocate even more money without limit, relying entirely on the state to solve all the difficulties, it would affect the state's financial expenditure, disrupt the entire national economic plan, and affect the completion of the Five-Year Plan as scheduled. This is contrary to the long-term interests of the people of the whole country and the people in the disaster areas. The year 1955 is a crucial year for the realization of China's first Five-Year Plan. If the state construction plan for this year were to be reduced, the entire Five-Year Plan would be difficult to complete. If the Five-Year Plan cannot be completed smoothly, the realization of national industrialization will be delayed, and the backward state of agriculture will be prolonged. Should we strive to increase production and practice economy, overcome difficulties, and ensure the successful completion of the Five-Year Plan? Or should we only care about immediate interests and hinder the completion of the Five-Year Plan? Obviously, we can only take the first path and must not take the second path.

So, what is the correct policy for disaster relief? It is "production for self-salvation, practicing economy to overcome famine, mutual assistance among the masses, supplemented by necessary relief from the government." This is the summary of our experience in leading the masses to fight against famine for many years, and it is also the policy that must be adopted for production and disaster relief today. This year, in the disaster-stricken areas, wherever this policy has been conscientiously implemented, significant results have been achieved in production and disaster relief, which has not only alleviated many of the difficulties in the lives of the disaster victims, but also increased social wealth and enhanced the masses' ability to resist disasters. Countless past experiences have proved that the potential power of the people is infinite. As long as we can explain the truth to the masses, encourage their confidence in overcoming disasters, point out the favorable conditions for overcoming disasters, and then organize and lead them to find ways to overcome difficulties, many good methods that we cannot imagine will emerge. The most harmful thing here is that some comrades confuse production for self-salvation with laissez-faire, thinking that there is no need for serious leadership when the masses are engaged in production for self-salvation. This idea must be thoroughly corrected.

According to the policy of production for self-salvation, we should do everything possible to organize the disaster victims to carry out agricultural production and various sideline productions. Now, the water level of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers is gradually receding, and most of the flooded farmland has emerged. The disaster victims who have been evacuated are returning to their hometowns to resume production one after another. In areas where the water has receded, we should immediately organize the disaster victims to rush to plant winter wheat, spring-harvest crops, and various vegetables, and do as much as possible to prepare for winter plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and restoration of small-scale water conservancy projects, in preparation for spring plowing next year. In areas where the water has not yet receded, we must seize the time to drain the water and rush to plant, strive to sow in time, and reduce the extent of the disaster as much as possible. For the disaster victims who have not yet returned to their hometowns, we must grasp the situation of water recession and organize them to return to their hometowns for production in a timely manner. In the past, we have made it possible for them to go out in an organized manner, and now we must also make it possible for them to return in an organized manner. It is wrong to think that "it is difficult to move out, but easy to move back," and thus relax leadership.

After the autumn planting season is over, organizing disaster victims to carry out various sideline productions is of particular importance. Fishing is an important sideline activity along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers and should be vigorously supported. Other handicraft productions such as weaving baskets and mats, bamboo and wood, should also be actively organized according to local conditions. When organizing disaster victims for production and self-salvation, economic departments should strive to do a good job in purchasing agricultural and sideline products in the disaster areas and supplying means of production and means of livelihood, as well as other economic assistance work. Due to the large extent of this year's disaster, the work of planned food supply and agricultural loan issuance in the disaster areas is very complex and difficult. Comrades in the economic departments must carry out these tasks with great enthusiasm. In terms of supply, we must be quick, timely, and appropriate. In terms of procurement, we must, according to the specific local conditions and national needs, purchase sideline products from the disaster areas in a planned way through contracts. At the same time, we must also provide necessary guidance for sideline production, so that the disaster victims can avoid blind production and unsalable products due to non-compliance with product specifications. In the Yangtze and Huai River areas, we must pay special attention to helping disaster victims solve problems such as fish processing, sales, and transportation. We should also help solve various difficulties such as funds and raw materials for other productions as much as possible.

Mobilizing necessary mutual aid and social relief is also an important way for disaster victims to overcome difficulties in production for self-salvation. In the past, in years of severe famine, we used this method to solve many difficulties. In this year's flood prevention, rescue, and relocation, mutual assistance among the masses also played a significant role. In the current production and disaster relief work, we must continue to promote this spirit of class love among the masses and mobilize mutual assistance according to necessity and possibility.

In addition to agricultural and sideline production, we should also organize work relief very well. The task of restoring embankments and plugging breaches this winter and next spring is very heavy, and the time is tight, requiring it to be done before spring plowing. In Anhui Province alone, it is estimated that 800,000 people will be mobilized to work on the Yangtze River embankment. Organizing disaster victims to participate in this project is of great benefit to completing the restoration of embankments and plugging breaches and to the production and self-salvation of disaster victims. We must strengthen the leadership of this work and make various preparations as soon as possible.

In order to solve the difficulties of disaster victims lacking means of production and means of livelihood, the state has allocated a considerable portion of relief grain and funds this year. All localities should conduct serious investigation and research, carefully understand the real and specific conditions of the disaster-stricken households, distinguish the degree of difficulty, grasp the principle of focusing on key uses, correctly distribute these grain and funds, and maximize the effectiveness of these grain and funds in promoting production. In terms of relief in food rations, housing, winter clothing, and medical care, it is also necessary to clearly distinguish disaster victims who have more difficulties, fewer difficulties, and do not need government relief, and distribute them rationally. On the one hand, we must oppose the tendency of average distribution, too wide a range of relief, and waste of state relief grain and funds. On the other hand, we must also prevent the tendency of not providing relief when it should be provided, not providing relief when it can be provided, providing relief untimely, and providing too little relief. Currently, the phenomenon of not providing relief when it should be provided has occurred in some areas of Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces, which should be checked and corrected immediately. It should also be noted that compensation and relief should be distinguished. In the flood diversion areas, compensation should be given to the masses if it was explained to them during the flood diversion. In the relief work, the class line should also be implemented. The relief for poor and middle peasants should not be the same as the relief for landlords and rich peasants; we should try to find other ways to solve the difficulties of landlords and rich peasants as much as possible.

In production and disaster relief work, special attention should be paid to relying on mutual aid and cooperation organizations; in the disaster areas, we must also adhere to the policy of taking mutual aid and cooperation as the center of all rural work without exception. In the past, during the people's revolutionary war, many mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the old revolutionary base areas were established, developed and consolidated in the process of overcoming difficulties and fighting against disasters. The peasant masses relied on these organizations to overcome many difficulties, tide over difficult years, and improve production. This year, in the struggle against floods, mutual aid and cooperation organizations also played a significant role. The current production and disaster relief work must also be combined with the mutual aid and cooperation movement. On the one hand, we should vigorously rectify and consolidate the existing mutual aid and cooperation organizations and rely on them to carry out production and overcome famine. At the same time, we should actively develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Because there are many difficulties in the disaster areas, it is difficult for individual farmers to overcome disasters independently, so "organizing and carrying out production to overcome famine" has become an urgent demand of the masses in the disaster areas. We should seize this demand of the masses and do our best to develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the disaster areas. This is not only necessary for production and disaster relief in the disaster areas, but also can further advance the cause of agricultural socialist transformation in the disaster areas. Some comrades believe that disaster relief work and mutual aid and cooperation are contradictory, so they only focus on pure disaster relief and do not pay attention to consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations. This is completely wrong and should be corrected quickly.

Due to the great difficulties and many problems in the disaster areas this year, we must pay more attention to strengthening the Party's leadership over production and disaster relief work. The Party committees must unite and organize the forces of various departments to carry out production and disaster relief work with mutual aid and cooperation as the center. We must oppose separating ourselves from production and disaster relief and carrying out other work in isolation. In heavily affected areas, we should concentrate our efforts and go all out; lightly affected areas should also be given appropriate care, so as not to turn light disasters into heavy ones and increase the difficulty of disaster relief work.

Floods are different from other natural disasters. Not only are crops damaged, but many houses, farm tools, and people's means of production and livelihood in the disaster areas have been destroyed. In some heavily affected areas, it is difficult to expect the accumulated water to be drained in the short term. Therefore, there are many difficulties in organizing disaster victims to resume production and rebuild their homes. However, we have the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and we have a vast organized and conscious people. In the past, our Party and government have led the people and relied on the people to overcome countless difficulties and disasters and accumulated rich experience in struggle. Today, we will certainly be able to overcome new difficulties. As long as we recognize the difficulties and the conditions for overcoming them, and are determined to fight against the difficulties, no difficulty can stop us from moving forward.

The staff and Communist Party members in the disaster areas, in the previous stage of flood prevention and rescue struggle, once displayed a selfless fighting spirit, went through all kinds of hardships, and created many miracles that had never been seen in history. Now, the serious difficulties left to us by the floods are still behind us. This requires the cadres and Party members in the disaster areas to recognize their glorious posts and sacred responsibilities, continue to carry forward the fighting will in the flood prevention struggle, be with the disaster victims, make persistent efforts, and fight to overcome this year's serious disaster!

### 坚持生产自救的救灾方针

    坚持生产自救的救灾方针
    今年我国部分地区遭受了特大洪水的袭击和较长时间的雨涝。灾区人民在共产党和人民政府的坚强领导下，向洪水进行了持续的斗争，取得了重大胜利；但是，由于今年洪水特别大，水位高，水势猛，来得早，退得迟，水灾为害的广度和深度一般仍超过过去几年。水灾不仅影响灾区千百万人民的生活，给整个国家的经济建设事业带来了一定的损害，也加重了今年生产救灾的任务。尽最大努力作好灾区的生产救灾工作，争取缩短灾期、缩小灾荒面，这就是当前的迫切的任务。
    如何战胜灾荒呢？有些同志希望国家拿出大量的钱来解决灾区人民的一切困难，这是不对的。今年国家已经拿出了比往年更多的钱来救灾，如果还要无限量地拿出更多钱来，一切困难完全靠国家解决，这就会影响国家的财政支出，打乱整个国民经济计划，影响到五年计划的如期完成。这是违反全国人民以及灾区人民的长远利益的。一九五五年对于实现我国第一个五年计划是极关重要的一年；这一年的国家建设计划如果要缩减，整个五年计划就很难完成。如果五年计划不能顺利地完成，国家工业化的实现就要拖迟，农业落后的状态也就要延长。是各方面努力增产节约，渡过困难，保证五年计划胜利完成呢？还是只顾眼前的利益而使五年计划的完成受到妨碍呢？很显然，我们只能走第一条路，决不能走第二条路。
    那么，救灾的正确方针是什么呢？这就是“生产自救，节约渡荒，群众互助，辅之以政府必要的救济”。这是我们多少年来领导群众和灾荒进行斗争的经验总结，也是今天生产救灾所必须采取的方针。今年在受灾地区，凡是认真贯彻了这个方针的，生产救灾工作都获得了显著的成绩，不仅解除了灾民生活上的许多困难，而且增加了社会财富，增强了群众的抗灾能力。过去无数经验证明：人民群众的潜在力量是无穷的，只要我们能向群众讲清道理，鼓舞他们战胜灾害的信心，指明战胜灾害的有利条件，并且进而组织领导他们寻找克服困难的门径，就会有许多我们想不到的好办法产生出来。这里最有害的是有一部分同志把生产自救和放任自流混淆起来，以为要群众生产自救就不需要认真领导，这种思想必须彻底纠正。
    根据生产救灾的方针，我们应该尽一切可能组织灾民开展农业生产和各种副业生产。现在，江淮水位日渐回落，被淹农田大部脱出，转移在外的灾民正陆续返乡恢复生产。在已经脱出积水的地区，应该马上组织灾民抢种冬小麦、春收作物和各种蔬菜，并要尽可能作好冬耕、积肥和恢复小型水利的工作，为明年春耕作好准备。尚未脱出的地区，要抓紧排水抢种，争取及时播种，尽量缩减灾荒面。对于尚未返乡的灾民，则要掌握退水情况，及时组织他们返乡生产。过去已经做到了使他们有组织地出去，现在还要做到使他们有组织地回来；认为
  “转出去困难，转回来容易”，因而放松领导，是错误的。
    秋种季节完了以后，组织灾民开展各种副业生产，具有特殊重要的意义。打鱼是江淮沿岸的重要副业活动，要大力加以扶植；其他如编筐打席，竹木等手工业生产，也应该因地制宜地积极组织。在组织灾民生产自救时，经济部门要努力作好灾区农副产品的收购工作和生产资料、生活资料的供应工作以及其它经济扶助工作。由于今年的灾荒面较大，灾区的粮食计划供应和农贷发放等工作是十分复杂和困难的，经济部门的同志必须以高度的热忱来进行这些工作。供应方面要作到迅速及时而且用之得当。收购方面要根据当地具体情况和国家需要，以订合同的方式有计划地收购灾区的副业产品，同时还要对副业生产进行必要的指导，使灾民避免盲目生产和因产品规格不合而发生滞销现象。在沿江淮地区特别要注意帮助灾民解决鱼类的加工、推销、运输等问题。其他生产也要尽可能帮助解决资金、原料等各种困难。
    发动必要的互助互济和社会救济，也是灾民生产自救中克服困难的重要办法。过去灾荒严重的年头，我们曾经用这种办法解决了很多困难。在今年的防汛抢险转移安置中，群众的互助互济也起了重大作用。在当前的生产救灾工作中，仍需继续发扬群众这种阶级友爱精神，根据必要和可能，发动互助互济。
    除了农副业生产之外，还应很好地组织以工代赈。今冬明春复堤堵口的任务很大，时间很紧，要求春耕以前就要作好。仅安徽省境长江方面的工程，估计就要动员八十万人上堤。组织灾民参加这一工程，对完成复堤堵口和灾民生产自救都有很大好处。必须加强对这一工作的领导，及早作好各种准备工作。
    为了解决灾民缺乏生产资料和生活资料的困难，国家今年拿出了相当大的一部分救济粮款。各地应该进行认真的调查研究工作，细致地了解受灾户的真实具体情况，分别困难程度，掌握重点使用的原则，正确地发放这些粮款，发挥这些粮款促进生产的最大效能。在口粮、房屋、寒衣、医疗等方面的救济上，也需要把困难多的，困难少的和不需政府救济的灾户分别清楚，合理发放。一方面要反对平均发放、救济面过宽、浪费国家救济粮款的偏向，另一方面也要防止该救不救，能救不救，救济不及时和救济太少的偏向。目前安徽、江苏等省部分地区已经发生了该救不救的现象，应当加以检查立即纠正。还应当注意，补偿和救济应有所区别。在分洪地区分洪时向群众讲明要补偿的，就应该予以补偿。在救济工作中也要贯彻阶级路线，对贫农、中农的救济和对地主、富农的救济不应该一样；对地主、富农要尽量设法用其他办法解决他们的困难。
    在生产救灾工作中应特别注意依靠互助合作组织；在灾区也必须无例外坚持以互助合作为一切农村工作的中心的方针。过去在人民革命战争时期，老根据地有许多互助合作组织都是在克服困难、战胜灾害中建立、发展并巩固起来的。农民群众依靠这些组织曾经克服了许多困难，渡过了艰难的岁月，并且提高了生产。今年在和水灾作斗争中，互助合作组织也起了重大的作用。当前的生产救灾工作也必须和互助合作运动结合进行，一方面大力整顿和巩固现有的互助合作组织，依靠它们来进行生产渡荒，同时还要积极发展互助合作组织。由于灾区困难多，个体农户很难独立战胜灾荒，所以“组织起来，生产渡荒”就成为灾区群众的迫切要求。我们应该抓紧群众这种要求，尽力发展灾区的互助合作组织。这不仅是灾区生产救灾所必需，同时也可以把灾区的农业社会主义改造事业向前推进一步。有些同志认为救灾工作和互助合作矛盾，因而只顾单纯救灾，不注意巩固和发展互助合作组织，这是完全错误的，应该赶快纠正。
    由于今年灾区困难大，问题多，就更要注意加强党对生产救灾工作的领导。党委必须统一组织各部门力量，开展以互助合作为中心的生产救灾工作。反对脱离生产救灾去孤立进行其他工作。在重灾地区应该集中力量，全力以赴；对轻灾地区也要加以适当照顾，免得使轻灾变重，增加救灾工作的困难。
    水灾和其他自然灾害不同，受损失的不仅是农作物，灾区许多房屋、农具以及人民的生产生活资料都遭到了毁坏；有些重灾地区，积水短期难望排出。因此，组织灾民恢复生产重建家园，困难是很多的。但是，我们有共产党和人民政府的领导，有广大的有组织有觉悟的人民，过去，我们的党和政府曾经领导人民、依靠人民战胜过无数的困难和灾害，积累了丰富的斗争经验；今天，我们也一定能够战胜新的困难。只要我们认清了困难和克服困难的条件，并且决心去和困难斗争，就没有什么困难能阻挡我们前进。
    灾区的工作人员和共产党员们，在前一段防汛抢险斗争中，曾经发挥了忘我的战斗精神，历尽艰险，作出了许多历史上未曾有过的奇迹。现在洪水留给我们的严重困难还在后边，这就要求灾区的干部、党员，认识自己的光荣岗位和神圣职责，继续发挥防汛斗争中的战斗意志，和灾民在一起，再接再厉，为战胜今年的严重灾荒而斗争！
