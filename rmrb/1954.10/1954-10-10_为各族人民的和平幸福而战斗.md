Fighting for the Peace and Happiness of All Ethnic Groups
Representative of the National People's Congress
Chief of Staff of a Certain Division of the People's Liberation Army Zhang Yingcai

    When I entered the Huairen Hall in the capital to attend the first session of the National People's Congress, I felt a supreme honor. At the same time, I felt that this honor was given by the Party and Chairman Mao and created by the thousands upon thousands of soldiers guarding the Yunnan border. When I had this feeling, I often thought of the changes that had taken place in the Yunnan border area over the past four and a half years, the arduous struggles our troops had fought there, and the comrades who had sacrificed and continued to fight to defend the border.
    In March 1950, after arduous battles, our troops victoriously advanced to both banks of the Honghe River in southern Yunnan, planting the five-star red flag on the border defense line where more than 20 ethnic groups, including Hani, Miao, Yao, and Dai, lived.
    We were victorious, but this was far from the final victory. The remnant Chiang bandits were not reconciled to their defeat and took the opportunity of our work not yet being carried out and the masses not yet mobilized to harass us everywhere. Thus, we, who had been fighting since crossing the river, immediately plunged into even more arduous battles without even a day's rest, fighting to consolidate the southwest border defense and to protect the peaceful life of all ethnic groups. At that time, we were indeed facing difficulties. The masses had not been mobilized, the ethnic policies had not been implemented, we were unfamiliar with the situation, and transportation was inconvenient, so material supplies were often not timely. When the troops sometimes couldn't get food, they would eat raw corn to satisfy their hunger; when they couldn't get water, they would quench their thirst with bamboo shoots. When their shoes were broken, many comrades ran barefoot. In the rainy season, because there were very few rain gear, the soldiers' clothes were often wet for seven or eight days. But our determination overcame all difficulties, and that was the determination to fight for the peace and happiness of all ethnic groups in the border areas.
    In the bandit suppression battles, how many moving deeds appeared in our troops, and how many heroes and models were produced! Comrade Kong Tinggui, a soldier of the first battalion of a certain regiment, encountered more than 30 bandits while his squad was dispersed to search and suppress bandits. When his comrades heard the gunshots in the distance and rushed to reinforce him, he had already heroically sacrificed himself, but in front of him lay three bandit corpses, one of whom he had stabbed to death with a bayonet. When everyone picked him up, they found that his bolt was hidden under his body and had not been snatched by the enemy. Later, this group of bandits was finally annihilated by us. Heroic fighter Hou Yongfu and his heroic platoon pursued the enemy continuously for eight days and nights, and finally captured a bandit regimental commander. The "Red Second Company" carried out a continuous pursuit and suppression battle for 26 days, covering more than 2,000 miles, and finally cooperated with fraternal troops to completely annihilate the He Guangrong bandit gang of the "Diannan Anti-Communist National Salvation Army."
    While suppressing bandits, we also carried out mass work, deeply publicized the Party's ethnic policies, coupled with the troops' strict discipline of respecting the customs and habits of ethnic minorities and the countless facts of soldiers helping the masses carry water, chop firewood, sow seeds, and harvest crops, so that the people of all ethnic groups gradually realized that the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Liberation Army were their saviors. As a result, estrangement and misunderstandings were eliminated, the relationship between the army and the people improved, and the people of all ethnic groups loved the People's Liberation Army as they loved their own children. "Self-Defense Forces for Preventing Bandits and Protecting Homes" were established everywhere, becoming a powerful assistant to our troops in defending the border. When they discovered large groups of bandits, they immediately reported them and rushed to act as guides and carry stretchers for the troops; when they encountered small groups of bandits, they blew cow horns all over the mountains and fields, using rifles, submachine guns, and signal guns to encircle and suppress them. In July 1951, Huang Wenhuan, a Lisu militia director in Jinping County, led a militia team and fought fiercely for a day with the Tang Mingxian bandit gang of Li Mi's bandit troops who had sneaked in from outside the border, killing Tang the bandit. This was a brilliant example of the border people defending their own happy lives.
    By the end of 1951, the bandits in the Diannan area had been basically eliminated. At this time, our troops still did not rest, and immediately helped the fraternal ethnic groups to develop production and improve their lives on an even larger scale. A wave of helping the masses build their homes was set off. If the masses lacked land to cultivate, we would help them open up wasteland; if they lacked houses to live in, we would help them build houses. Some ethnic minorities in individual places did not know how to grow vegetables, so we taught them how to grow vegetables. Wu Renhai, the quartermaster of the "Iron and Steel Battalion" of a certain regiment of our division, specially asked for "Golden Queen" corn seeds from his hometown and planted them on the land of the fraternal ethnic groups. At the same time, our troops also helped the fraternal ethnic groups clear away dirt and accumulated manure and pay attention to hygiene. Medical teams were organized to treat diseases for the people of ethnic minorities, gradually changing the lack of hygiene habits and scientific knowledge of the people of all ethnic groups.
    Now, the face of the Yunnan border area has changed greatly compared to more than four years ago. Social order is unprecedentedly stable, transportation has been restored and developed, and ethnic minorities who could not wear cloth or eat salt in the past can now buy cloth and salt. The production of all ethnic groups is developing, their lives are improving, the unity among all ethnic groups has been strengthened, and the unity between the army and the people has become even more consolidated. The beautiful and rich border area presents a thriving new atmosphere. This is a great victory for the Party's ethnic policies, a great achievement of the hard work of the People's Government and the People's Army; our troops stationed on the Yunnan border must accelerate towards a modernized national defense army on the basis of cultural learning and military training for more than two years, and continue to fight to defend this great victory and consolidate national defense!

### 为各族人民的和平幸福而战斗

    为各族人民的和平幸福而战斗
    全国人民代表大会代表
    人民解放军某师参谋长  张英才
    当我走进首都的怀仁堂，参加全国人民代表大会第一次会议的时候，我感到一种最高的荣誉，同时我也感到这种荣誉是党和毛主席给予的，是守卫云南边疆的千千万万战士们创造的。而在发生这种感触的时候，我往往就要想起四年半以来云南边疆发生的变化，想起了我们部队在那里作过的艰巨斗争，想起那些为保卫边疆而牺牲了和继续奋斗着的战友们。
      一九五○年的三月，经过艰苦的战斗以后，我们部队胜利地挺进到滇南的红河两岸了，把五星红旗插在哈尼、苗、瑶、傣等二十多种民族聚居的边防线上。
    我们胜利了，但这远远不是最后的胜利。残余蒋匪并不甘心自己的失败，利用我们工作尚未开展和群众尚未发动的时机到处进行骚扰。于是，从渡江以后一直在战斗着的我们，连一天也没有来得及休息又投入了更艰苦的战斗，为巩固西南边防，为保卫各族人民和平生活而战斗了。当时，我们的确是困难的，群众还没发动，民族政策还没贯彻，情况不熟，交通不便，因此物资供应往往不及时。部队有时吃不上饭，大家就吃生苞谷充饥，有时喝不上水，就以竹笋解渴。鞋子破了，许多同志就赤着脚跑，在霪雨的季节，因为防雨用具甚少，战士们的衣服常常七八天不干。可是我们的决心战胜了一切困难，这就是为边疆各族人民的和平幸福而战的决心。
    在剿匪战斗中，我们部队出现了多少可歌可泣的事迹，产生了多少英雄和模范啊。某团一营战士孔廷贵同志在小组分散搜剿土匪时，与三十多个土匪遭遇。当他的战友在遥远的地方听到枪声急忙赶来增援时，他已经壮烈牺牲，但是在他身前摆着三具匪尸，其中一个是被他用刺刀刺死的。大家把他抬起来的时候，又发现他的枪栓藏在身底下，没有被敌人抢去。后来这股土匪终于被我们歼灭。战斗英雄侯永福同志和他的英雄排，连续追敌八昼夜，终于将土匪一个团长捕获。“红二连”进行了连续二十六天辗转两千多里的追剿战，终于配合兄弟部队将匪“滇南反共救国军”贺光荣匪部全部歼灭。
    在剿匪的同时，我们又开展了群众工作，深入宣传党的民族政策，加上部队尊重少数民族风俗习惯的严明纪律以及战士们帮助群众担水、打柴、播种、收割的无数事实，使各族人民逐渐认识了共产党、毛主席和解放军就是他们的救星。于是隔阂误会消除了，军民关系改善了，各族人民像热爱自己子弟一样的热爱人民解放军，“防匪保家自卫队”到处成立起来了，成为我们部队保卫边疆的有力助手。发现大股土匪他们就立即报告，并争先恐后给部队当向导、抬担架；遇到小股土匪，他们就满山遍野吹起牛角，用步枪、冲锋枪、鸣火枪进行包剿。一九五一年七月金平县一个窝尼族联防主任黄文欢，带领一个联防队，和自境外窜入的李弥匪部的唐明先股匪激战一天，将唐匪击毙，便是边疆人民保卫自己幸福生活的光辉范例。
    一九五一年年底，滇南地区的土匪基本肃清了。这时，我们部队仍然没有休息，立即以更大的规模帮助兄弟民族发展生产，改善生活。掀起帮助群众建设家园的热潮，群众缺地种，我们便帮助他们开荒，缺房子住，我们便帮助他们盖房子，个别地方的兄弟民族不会种菜，我们便把种菜的方法教给他们。我师某团“钢铁营”事务长武仁孩特地从自己的家乡要来“金黄后”包谷籽，播种在兄弟民族的土地上。我们部队同时还帮助兄弟民族清除秽土积粪，讲究卫生。组织医疗所为少数民族人民治病，逐渐改变着各族人民缺乏卫生习惯和科学常识的状态。
    现在，云南边疆的面貌比起四年多以前已经大大改变了。社会秩序空前安定，交通运输得到了恢复和发展，从前穿不到布吃不到盐的少数民族人民，可以买到布匹和盐巴了。各族人民的生产在发展，生活在改善，各族人民之间团结了，军民之间的团结更加巩固了。美丽富饶的边疆呈现出一片欣欣向荣的新气象。这是党的民族政策的伟大胜利，这是人民政府和人民军队努力工作的伟大成果；我们驻守云南边疆的部队在两年多来文化学习和军事训练的基础上一定要加速向现代化国防军迈进，为保卫这一伟大胜利成果，为巩固国防而继续奋斗！
