Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Ministry of Commerce and the China Store Employees' Union jointly held the first political work conference of the national state-owned commercial system from September 14th to 25th to discuss further increasing production and practicing economy in the state-owned commercial system. The conference held that increasing production and practicing economy is a regular task of state-owned commerce; at the same time, due to the objective conditions of commercial work varying seasonally, especially the seasonality of agricultural and handicraft production and people's purchasing power, which is reflected in the work of state-owned commerce, different seasons have different specific requirements. Therefore, while continuing to increase production and practice economy, the specific requirements change and develop according to objective needs. The conference believes that to further increase production and practice economy in the state-owned commercial system, it is necessary to improve the political awareness of all employees, implement the Party's economic policies, mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of employees, and strengthen planning and improve business management, on the premise of stabilizing the market, doing a good job of serving production and consumers, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. This will lead to continuously expanding commodity circulation, accelerating capital turnover, reducing circulation costs, and correctly completing state plans.
The conference further pointed out that the state-owned commercial plan is an important part of the national economic plan, and whether the state-owned commercial plan can be completed has a significant impact on whether the national plan can be fully completed. The successful implementation of the state-owned commercial plan is of great importance to gradually guaranteeing the needs of urban and rural people's lives, the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production, the increase of national tax revenue and accumulation, the speed of socialist industrialization, and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. In particular, in order to cooperate with the national people's struggle to support the liberation of Taiwan and further increase production and practice economy, realizing the state's planned tasks for state-owned commerce is of even greater significance.
The conference emphasized that, in order to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the state-owned commercial plan for the fourth quarter of this year, the specific work of increasing production and practicing economy is: first, to vigorously purchase agricultural products and do a good job in the unified purchase and purchase of agricultural products; according to policy requirements and source conditions, expand the sales of industrial products, especially to organize industrial products to go to the countryside to cooperate with the purchase of agricultural products, and correctly organize the source of industrial products. At the same time, efforts should be made to reduce commodity circulation costs and reduce or even eliminate accidents and losses. The conference also pointed out that, whether in the purchase of agricultural products, the sales of industrial products to the countryside, the unified arrangement of the market, or the implementation of policies on the utilization, restriction, and transformation of private merchants, cooperatives are close and powerful assistants to state-owned commerce. To further increase production and practice economy, state-owned commerce must attach great importance to further combining with cooperatives in order to advance victoriously.

    商业部和店员工会联合举行政治工作会议
    决定发动职工进一步增产节约
    【新华社十六日讯】商业部和中国店员工会在九月十四日到二十五日联合举行全国国营商业系统第一次政治工作会议，讨论进一步在国营商业系统进行增产节约。会议认为进行增产节约是国营商业的经常任务；同时由于商业工作所处的客观条件随季节性有所不同，特别是农业和手工业生产以及人民购买力的季节性，反映在国营商业工作上，不同的季节就有不同的具体要求。因此增产节约，在持续进行中，其具体要求的内容是随客观需要变化和发展的。会议认为在国营商业系统中进一步进行增产节约，应在稳定市场，作好为生产和为消费者服务，巩固工农联盟的前提下，提高全体职工的政治认识，贯彻党的经济政策，发动全体职工群众的积极性和创造性，加强计划性，改善经营管理。做到不断扩大商品流转，加速资金周转，降低流转费用，正确完成国家计划。
    会议进一步指出了国营商业计划是国民经济计划的一个重要组成部分，国营商业计划能否完成对国家计划能否全面完成有重大影响。国营商业计划执行的好坏，对于逐步保证城乡人民生活的需要，工农业生产的不断发展，国家税收和积累的增加，社会主义工业化的速度，工农联盟的巩固，都有重要关系。特别是为了配合全国人民支援解放台湾的斗争进一步进行增产节约，实现国家交给国营商业的计划任务，就有更重要的意义。
    会议着重提出：为了保证今年第四季度国营商业计划的完成和超额完成，进行增产节约的具体工作；首先是大力收购农产品，作好农产品统购和收购工作；根据政策要求和货源情况，扩大工业品推销，特别要组织工业品下乡配合收购农产品，并正确组织工业品货源。与此同时，要努力降低商品流转费用，减少以至消灭事故和损失。会议并指出：无论在农产品收购、工业品下乡以及统一安排市场和贯彻对私商利用、限制和改造的政策等任何一方面，合作社都是国营商业亲密的有力的助手。国营商业进一步进行增产节约，必须十分重视进一步与合作社结合，才能胜利前进。
