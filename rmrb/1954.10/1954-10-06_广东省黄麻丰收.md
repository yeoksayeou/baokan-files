Guangdong Province has achieved a bumper harvest of jute on over 127,000 mu of land. According to preliminary statistics, the average yield per mu is 300 jin of raw jute, an increase of 15% over last year. The total jute production in the province this year is expected to increase by more than 100,000 dan compared to last year. In Dongguan County, a major jute-producing area, the 13,800 mu of jute achieved a large-scale bumper yield of an average of more than 590 jin per mu, due to the implementation of advanced cultivation techniques such as appropriate close planting, sufficient base fertilizer application, and cultivation of strong seedlings. The Yuan Linda mutual aid team in the county, a model for high jute yield, achieved an average yield of more than 970 jin per mu on its seven mu of land; Yuan Linda himself produced more than 1,200 jin on a 1.1 mu high-yield plot, setting the highest record for jute yield per unit area in the province. In Huazhou County, Yuexi District, the Li Junyan mutual aid team's more than 12 mu of jute, although suffering from severe drought and insect pests, still achieved a bumper yield of more than 590 jin per mu, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year.

    广东省黄麻丰收
    广东省十二万七千多亩黄麻获得丰收。据初步统计，每亩平均产三百斤生黄麻，比去年增产一成半。全省今年黄麻总产量，预计比去年增产十万多担。主要产麻区的东莞县的一万三千八百亩黄麻，由于推行了适度密植、施足基肥、培育壮苗等先进耕作技术，取得了平均每亩产麻五百九十多斤的大面积丰产成绩。该县黄麻丰产模范袁林达互助组的七亩多地平均每亩产九百七十多斤；袁林达本人一块一亩一分丰产地，产了一千二百多斤，创造了该省黄麻单位面积产量的最高纪录。粤西区化县李钧炎互助组的十二亩多黄麻，虽然遭受了严重的旱灾和虫害的袭击，平均每亩仍获得五百九十多斤的丰产成绩，比去年增产两成以上。
