The first public library staff training class, jointly organized by the Social Culture Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, Peking University, and the Beijing Library, graduated on October 21st.

The training class had a total of 84 students, including library work cadres and some cultural administrative staff. Since the start of classes on August 10th, they have studied 23 courses related to library work and listened to reports by Zheng Zhenduo, Feng Xuefeng, and others. Through this study, the students have further realized that libraries are one of the powerful propaganda weapons to promote China's socialist construction. Library workers should recommend good books to the people, so that good books can be widely and quickly circulated. At the same time, they should gradually carry out the work of guiding reading to expand the socialist ideological front.

    公共图书馆工作人员训练班结业
    文化部社会文化事业管理局、北京大学、北京图书馆联合举办的第一届公共图书馆工作人员训练班，已于十月二十一日结业。
    参加训练班的学员共八十四人，包括图书馆工作干部和部分文化行政工作人员。他们自八月十日开课以来，学习了有关图书馆工作的二十三门功课，听了郑振铎、冯雪峰等人的报告。经过这次学习，学员们都进一步认识到：图书馆是推动我国社会主义建设事业的有力宣传武器之一。图书馆工作者应当在人民群众中推荐好书，使好书广泛、迅速地流传，同时逐步开展指导阅读图书的工作，以扩大社会主义的思想阵地。
