To ensure the successful completion of the state cotton procurement task, with the imminent large-scale marketing of cotton from various regions, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued urgent instructions on October 20 to its affiliates regarding strengthening cotton unified purchase work. The instructions pointed out:

    I. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in cotton-producing areas should immediately cooperate with the local Party and government to rapidly deploy the unified purchase work to the villages and repeatedly explain the unified purchase policy to cotton-growing farmers. Raise farmers' political awareness to lay the ideological foundation for carrying out the cotton sales movement.

    II. In areas where the unified purchase work has not yet been deployed to the villages or where production assessment and sales have not yet been carried out, it is still necessary to vigorously publicize the state's unified purchase policy for cotton and mobilize farmers to sell cotton. In areas where production assessment and sales have already begun, cooperatives at all levels should actively assist the state in clarifying cotton production, civilian consumption, and local textile cotton usage so that the state's unified purchase tasks can be practical.

    III. In cotton procurement, processing, storage, transportation, and other work are very important. All cotton purchasing units should conduct a comprehensive inspection of purchasing stations, processing plants, warehouse storage, transportation tools, etc., to meet the needs of large-scale purchases. Cooperatives with insufficient processing capacity should make full use of private cotton gins. In areas that previously purchased lint cotton and are now switching to purchasing seed cotton, if processing capacity is not adequately prepared, a portion of lint cotton may be appropriately purchased.

    IV. Cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas should do a good job in supplying materials to meet the needs of farmers after selling cotton to purchase means of production and means of livelihood. While supplying materials, they should mobilize farmers, on a voluntary basis, to use their surplus money for savings, expand credit cooperatives, repay agricultural loans, and clear pre-purchase contracts, etc.

    V. Local cooperatives should strengthen the management of primary markets and strictly prohibit private cotton merchants and peddlers from purchasing and transporting cotton.

    VI. Directors of cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas should personally lead this work, earnestly solve various problems in the unified purchase of cotton, and strive to complete the cotton purchase task. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国供销合作总社紧急指示各级合作社
    努力保证完成国家棉花收购任务
    各地棉花将大量上市，为保证胜利完成国家棉花收购任务，中华全国供销合作总社在十月二十日向所属发出关于加强棉花统购工作的紧急指示。指示指出：
    一、产棉区的各级合作社应立即配合当地党和政府把统购工作迅速布置到村，并向种棉农民反复讲明统购政策，提高农民政治觉悟，为开展售棉运动打下思想基础。
    二、统购工作还没有布置到村或还没有进行评产评售的地区，仍应大力宣传国家统购棉花的政策，动员农民出售棉花。在已经开始评产评售的地区，各级合作社应积极协助国家弄清棉花产量、民用量和土纺用棉的情况，使国家统购任务能切合实际。
    三、棉花收购中，加工、保管、运输等工作十分重要。各收棉单位对收购站、加工厂、仓库保管、运输工具等应进行一次普遍检查，以适应大量收购的需要。加工力量不足的合作社，应充分利用私人轧花车，过去收皮棉今年改收籽棉的地区，如加工力量准备不及，可适当增收一部分皮棉。
    四、各产棉区合作社应做好物资供应工作，以满足农民出售棉花后购买生产资料和生活资料的需要。在供应物资的同时，应动员农民在自愿的原则下，把多余的钱用以储蓄、扩大信用合作社、并归还农贷、清理预购合同等。
    五、各地合作社应加强对初级市场的管理工作，严禁私营棉花商、贩收购和贩运棉花。
    六、各产棉区合作社主任应亲自领导这一工作，切实解决棉花统购中各项问题，努力争取完成购棉任务。　（新华社）
