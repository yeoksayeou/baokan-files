Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The foreign ministers of the nine countries that signed the London Agreement on arming West Germany began negotiations in Paris on October 21.
    The nine ministers are negotiating to discuss how to cobble together a new military bloc called the "Western European Union." They held a total of two meetings on the 21st. The morning meeting discussed the experts' report, and later decided that the leadership structure of the "Western European Union" would be located in London.
    The day before, Dulles, Eden, Mendes-France, and Adenauer held talks to discuss the so-called "restoration" of West German "sovereignty." In this unilateral meeting, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France had already reached an agreement with Adenauer on "abolishing the occupation statute." However, they only made a decision in principle on the issue of restoring West German "sovereignty," because the four ministers were unable to resolve certain contentious issues, particularly the issue of the stationing of occupying forces in Berlin.
    The above-mentioned course of negotiations convincingly shows how dangerous a path the countries that recently concluded the London Agreement on arming West Germany have embarked upon. Now, under the pressure of American diplomacy, they have to agree to certain specific measures that lead to the revival of the West German army. Such high-sounding phrases as restoring West German "sovereignty" cannot deceive anyone, not even the Germans in West Germany. On the one hand, Western countries say they are abolishing the occupation statute, but on the other hand, they are still stationing troops in West Germany. It can only be said that this situation is restoring West Germany's freedom to implement armament and participate in military blocs.
    According to newspaper reports, sharp differences have arisen among the participants in the talks. "La Tribune des Nations" said that the "serious contradictions" between Western countries make the Saar issue and the establishment of a "weapons pool organization" the two "main obstacles" to resolving all other issues related to arming West Germany.
    The "weapons pool organization" mentioned by this newspaper was proposed by Mendes-France at the London conference, with the aim of not only unifying the production of weapons, but also distributing American military "aid." This proposal aroused opposition from the United States, which regards its "aid" as a tool for exerting pressure on various countries, and therefore has no intention of transferring this tool to anyone. Some "small" partners in the military bloc also opposed this proposal, fearing France's monopoly in the production of weapons.
    On the night of October 19, a communiqué was published on the talks between French Prime Minister Mendes-France and West German Chancellor Adenauer. The communiqué stated that they discussed issues of industry, trade, and agriculture, and both sides "reached an agreement to take measures to promote the development of Franco-German trade and lay the foundation for extensive cooperation in industry and agriculture."
    The communiqué also pointed out that they will continue to hold talks on the Saar issue.
    As everyone knows, after the Second World War, the Saar was economically incorporated into France, but the Saar maintained internal political autonomy, although in reality the Saar was under French control. West Germany is trying its best to free the Saar from French control. The Saar issue has long been the subject of fruitless negotiations between France and West Germany.
    It is worth noting that Adenauer's trip to Paris to conduct new negotiations with France on the Saar issue comes on the eve of the negotiations on arming West Germany based on the London Agreement. Many political figures in France demand that the Saar issue be resolved in accordance with the wishes of the French government as a condition for France's agreement to arm West Germany. The recent congress of the Radical Socialist Party put forward such a request. French Prime Minister Mendes-France belongs to the Radical Socialist Party.
    It can be seen from this that the communiqué and newspaper commentaries both show that in order to enable French capital to retain its privileges in the Saar, the French ruling clique is preparing to open a broad road for West German capitalists to French colonies.
    Although the French delegation put forward some attractive proposals and made concessions, no agreement was reached on the Saar issue. Parisian newspapers emphasized that Mendes-France and Adenauer had serious differences in the course of the talks.
    According to newspaper reports, the demands of the West German delegation are: to allow pro-German parties in the Saar to operate freely; free German investment; and to expand trade between the Saar and West Germany, etc.
    Parisian newspapers continue to publish comments on the meetings held by Western countries in Paris. "Liberation" commented on the four-country talks, saying: French Prime Minister Mendes-France wants to exchange the establishment of a German army for the Saar. The newspaper wrote: "We know what Hitler did to take back the Saar. Once Germany is armed, it will use guns to coerce us to solve the Saar issue. Mendes-France deliberately forgets Hitler's methods."
    "L'Humanité" particularly pointed out that the negotiations held in Paris have three characteristics: there is an attempt to resolve the issue of arming West Germany as quickly as possible, the Bonn government representatives are satisfied, and the British and Americans are increasing pressure on the French representatives.
    "L'Humanité" said, "The intention to conclude this matter quickly is very obvious. This intention stems from two considerations: to establish a new German Wehrmacht as soon as possible as a tool for Western countries to implement a policy of strength in Europe, and to prevent public opinion from having the opportunity to express its views and understand the truth of the matter."

### 西方国家为武装西德加紧外交活动

    西方国家为武装西德加紧外交活动
    据新华社讯：签订关于武装西德的伦敦协定的九国外长十月二十一日在巴黎开始谈判。
    九国部长进行谈判是为了要讨论如何拼凑一个名为“西欧联盟”的新军事集团。二十一日，他们一共举行了两次会议。上午会议讨论了专家的报告，后来决定“西欧联盟”的领导机构设在伦敦。
    在这以前一天，杜勒斯、艾登、孟戴斯—弗朗斯和阿登纳举行了会谈，商讨所谓“恢复”西德“主权”的问题。在这个片面会议上，美国、英国和法国的代表已经和阿登纳达成了“关于取消占领法规”的协议。但是他们只不过是就所谓恢复西德“主权”的问题作出了原则性的决定而已，因为四国部长没有能够解决某些争持不下的问题，特别是关于占领军驻在柏林的问题。
    上述这些谈判的经过令人信服地表明：不久以前缔结了关于武装西德的伦敦协定的国家已经走上了多么危险的道路。现在它们在美国外交的压力下不得不同意某些导致西德军队复活的具体措施。恢复西德“主权”这样一类冠冕堂皇的辞句，欺骗不了任何人，甚至欺骗不了西德的德国人。西方国家一方面说取消占领法规，另一方面却仍然在西德留驻军队，由此可见，这种情况只能说是恢复了西德实行武装和参加军事集团的自由。
    从报纸的消息看来，会谈参加者之间发生了尖锐的分歧。“震旦报”说，西方国家之间的“严重矛盾”使萨尔问题和建立“武器共储组织”的问题成为解决同武装西德有关的其他所有问题的两个“主要障碍”。
    这家报纸所谈的“武器共储组织”是孟戴斯—弗朗斯在伦敦会议时提出的，其目的不仅是要统一生产武器，而且还要分配美国的军事“援助”。这项建议引起了美国的反对，美国把自己的“援助”当做对各国施行压力的工具，因而一点也不打算把这个工具转让给任何人。反对这项建议的还有军事集团中的一些“小”伙伴，它们害怕法国在生产武器方面的垄断。
    十月十九日夜间公布了法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯和西德总理阿登纳的会谈公报。公报说，他们讨论了工业、贸易和农业的问题，双方“达成协议，要采取一些促进法德贸易发展和为工业和农业方面进行广泛合作打下基础的措施”。
    公报还指出，他们将继续进行关于萨尔问题的会谈。
    大家知道，在第二次世界大战后，萨尔在经济上是归并于法国的，不过萨尔保持内政的自治，虽然实际上萨尔是处于法国控制之下。西德极力想使萨尔脱离法国的控制。萨尔问题一直是法国和西德长期以来无结果的谈判的主题。
    值得注意的是：阿登纳到巴黎和法国就萨尔问题进行新的谈判的时候，正是在根据伦敦协议举行武装西德的谈判的前夕。法国许多政界人士要求依照法国政府的愿望来解决萨尔问题，作为法国同意武装西德的条件。激进社会党不久前所召开的代表大会就提出了这样的要求。法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯就是属于激进社会党。
    由此可见，公报和报纸评论都表明了，法国统治集团为了使法国资本在萨尔保有特权，准备给西德资本家打开一条通往法国殖民地的康庄大道。
    虽然法国代表团提出了一些诱人的建议，也作了让步，但是萨尔问题还是没有取得协议。巴黎各报着重说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯和阿登纳在会谈的过程中有着严重的分歧。
    从报纸消息看来，西德代表团的要求是：让萨尔亲德党派自由活动；德国投资自由；扩大萨尔和西德之间的贸易等。
    巴黎报纸继续就西方国家在巴黎举行的一些会议发表评论。“解放报”评论四国谈判说：法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯想拿建立德国军队来换取萨尔。报纸写道：“我们知道：希特勒为了取回萨尔是怎样做的。一旦德国武装起来，它就要用枪炮来胁迫我们解决萨尔问题了，孟戴斯—弗朗斯故意忘掉了希特勒的做法。”
      “人道报”特别指出：在巴黎举行的谈判具有这样三种特点：有人企图尽可能快地解决武装西德的问题，波恩政府代表感到满意以及英美对法国代表加重压力。
      “人道报”说，“要迅速了结这件事的意图，是十分明显的。这种意图是出于两种考虑：尽快地建立新的德国国防军，作为西方国家在欧洲实行实力政策的工具，并且不让舆论有机会发表意见，不让舆论了解事情的原委。”
