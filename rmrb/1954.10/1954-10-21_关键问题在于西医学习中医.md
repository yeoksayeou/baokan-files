    Uniting Chinese and Western medicine to serve the people is a healthcare policy that Chairman Mao explicitly pointed out more than a decade ago. Chairman Mao taught us in the article "The United Front in Cultural Work": "Of course, new medicine is superior to old medicine, but if new medicine does not care about the suffering of the people, does not train doctors for the people, does not unite with the existing one thousand-plus old-style doctors and veterinarians in the border areas and help them to progress, then it is actually helping sorcerers and shamans, actually heartlessly watching large numbers of people and livestock die." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III, page 1010) This instruction profoundly illustrates how crucial the unity and cooperation of Chinese and Western medicine are for the health of the broad masses of the people. Since the national liberation, in accordance with the spirit indicated by Chairman Mao, uniting Chinese and Western medicine has been established as one of the four major principles of healthcare work in New China. Over the years, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have given many specific instructions on how to unite and help traditional Chinese medicine, and on how to promote and organize our country's medical heritage. If we earnestly understand these instructions and conscientiously carry out our work based on these instructions, we will definitely gain a great deal in leveraging the role of traditional Chinese medicine, promoting our country's medical heritage, and enriching the content of New China's medicine. However, we have not achieved the due gains. To this day, hundreds of thousands of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in our country can be said to remain in an unvalued position. What is the reason for this? It lies in the fact that although our healthcare leadership departments regard uniting Chinese and Western medicine as their working principle, they have not actually earnestly implemented this principle.
    In recent years, the healthcare departments have done some work in the field of traditional Chinese medicine, such as establishing traditional Chinese medicine refresher schools, organizing joint traditional Chinese medicine clinics and traditional Chinese medicine outpatient departments, and promoting acupuncture therapy, etc. These efforts have also achieved some results. However, these efforts have not fundamentally solved the problem of leveraging the role of traditional Chinese medicine.
    The Chinese Medical Association is also the same. The general office of the Chinese Medical Association once held a special symposium, inviting traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to participate, and established a Committee for Academic Exchange between Chinese and Western Medicine last year. But in all seriousness, these are just some preliminary and superficial efforts. In this regard, there is still much work that should be done but has not been done. The Committee for Academic Exchange between Chinese and Western Medicine has only managed to enable Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to exchange experiences with each other at symposiums, and it is still far from truly connecting Chinese and Western medicine in their work and academic research. Hospitals rarely consult with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, and even rarer is Western medicine earnestly seeking advice from traditional Chinese medicine. Since the national liberation, how many Western medicine practitioners have seriously studied China's old medicine and achieved some success? It can be said that there are very few. The vast majority of Western medicine practitioners have not regarded learning traditional Chinese medicine as something they should do, which cannot but be attributed to the leadership of the healthcare administrative leadership departments and the Chinese Medical Association failing to fulfill their leadership responsibilities.
    Speaking for myself, although I have seen patients together with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, I have not regarded China's old medicine as a compulsory course. I have not seriously studied traditional Chinese medicine books. Therefore, to this day, I am still a layman in terms of knowledge of our country's old medicine. It is very shameful for a leader of healthcare work, a leader of a medical academic organization, to know nothing about his country's old medicine. I should study honestly.
    Our country's medicine has a history of thousands of years. Traditional Chinese medicine has played a certain guaranteeing role in the continuation and development of our nation. To this day, almost all rural residents and half or more of urban residents in our country still rely on traditional Chinese medicine for medical treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine, both in the past and present, has made great contributions to the people. This is a fact that no one can deny. This fact powerfully illustrates the actual effective role of traditional Chinese medicine in healthcare and treatment. Ignoring this fact is, of course, an unscientific attitude. If we do not start from this fact to value traditional Chinese medicine, unite traditional Chinese medicine, help traditional Chinese medicine, and humbly learn from traditional Chinese medicine, then we are disregarding the interests of the people, and we cannot talk about caring about the health of the people.
    Our country's old medicine, with its long history, is an important part of our country's old culture, which also has a long history. Our country's old culture has made great contributions to the world, and the medical part of it is particularly outstanding in its contributions to the world. Not only in ancient times did many countries learn medicine from our country, but even in modern times, there are still many countries studying our country's old medicine. This is also a fact that no one can deny. This fact powerfully illustrates that our country's old medical heritage has very rich treasures, which are worth inheriting and developing. Ignoring this fact is, of course, also an unscientific attitude. If we do not start from this fact to seriously study, research, and organize our country's old medicine, then we are actually willing to abandon all the precious heritage passed down by our ancestors. In that case, we would be letting down our people, our ancestors, and our descendants. Promoting our country's medical heritage to enrich the content of our new medicine is a arduous responsibility that should be shouldered by our generation.
    Therefore, whether we earnestly implement the principle of uniting Chinese and Western medicine is related to the health of the people of our country, the development of medicine in our country, and the scientific contribution of our country to the people of the world. Obviously, any medical worker should treat this issue seriously.
    In the past, we advocated that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should study Western medicine. This is certainly necessary, but it is not the most important thing. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao instructed us that the key issue now is Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine. If we simply emphasize traditional Chinese medicine learning Western medicine, the result is that traditional Chinese medicine will be completely transformed into Western medicine, which means abandoning traditional Chinese medicine and only wanting Western medicine. Only by not only having traditional Chinese medicine learn Western medicine but also especially emphasizing Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine can we truly achieve the mutual connection of Chinese and Western medicine, and finally develop into one medicine. This one medicine is China's new medicine, which has a modern natural science foundation and absorbs all medical achievements from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. In the past, among our healthcare leadership departments, most comrades did not realize this point and were only satisfied with establishing traditional Chinese medicine refresher schools. I myself was exactly like this. Although the general office of the Chinese Medical Association had called on Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to learn from each other, it did not organize Western medicine practitioners to systematically study traditional Chinese medicine. I believe that in the future, the general office of the Chinese Medical Association should assist the Ministry of Health in actively undertaking the task of organizing Western medicine practitioners to study traditional Chinese medicine.
    The main ideological obstacle for Western medicine to learn traditional Chinese medicine is looking down on traditional Chinese medicine. This idea of looking down on traditional Chinese medicine must be broken. There may be two reasons for the emergence of this idea. First, it is believed that everything foreign is good, and China's own old things are not good. This is actually a manifestation of being influenced by comprador bourgeois ideology. Of course, because China has been in a feudal era for a long time, its industry and natural sciences are backward. Therefore, it is very necessary to make efforts to absorb the research results of foreign natural sciences. In order to develop New China's science, it is especially necessary to first study Soviet science. Without doing so, we will remain in a backward position. However, this alone is not enough. We must see that our country's cultural heritage of thousands of years is the result of the wisdom and creativity of our people. Among our country's old culture, there are many essential parts that are worth absorbing. It is wrong not to absorb good things from foreign countries, and it is also wrong not to see the good things that originally existed in our own country. Second, it is believed that only modern and new things are worth learning, and all old things are not worth learning; it is believed that traditional Chinese medicine is outdated and backward, so there is absolutely no need to learn it. This is actually an unscientific and ahistorical view. Which science does not have its history of development? Which modern science has not been developed by absorbing all the experiences and research results on this subject in history? How can history be cut off? Studying modern culture is to make modern culture develop further. Studying old culture and absorbing its essence is also to make modern culture develop further. If it is said that modern things have completely included past things, then it does not conform to the facts. There is still much about past things that we have not clarified. This is especially true for traditional Chinese medicine. The scope of traditional Chinese medicine is very broad. How much have we actually studied? It can be said that it is very little. Facts have proved that even this very little that has been studied has been of great use to us (such as the research on drugs like Changshan, Betel nut, Ya Danzi, Angelica, Motherwort, etc., and acupuncture research, etc.); if we continue to expand the scope of learning and research on traditional Chinese medicine and unearth all the treasures of our country's old medicine and use them for the people, what a huge harvest that will be! However, this huge project cannot be completed by Western medicine alone, nor can it be completed by traditional Chinese medicine alone. We must learn from each other and conduct joint research. Now, what should be especially emphasized is that Western medicine should learn traditional Chinese medicine.
    Some people think that Chinese medicine can be learned, but traditional Chinese medicine theory is not worth learning. This is also a wrong idea. How can Chinese medicine be separated from traditional Chinese medicine theory? Isn't the discovery of the therapeutic effects of many Chinese medicines the result of thousands of years of traditional Chinese medicine practice? Moreover, traditional Chinese medicine includes not only the use of medicine. Other treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine, as well as methods of observing diseases and attitudes towards patients, are also worth learning.
    Of course, we are not saying that everything in traditional Chinese medicine is good. The absorption of our country's old medicine should be approached with a critical attitude of discarding the old and bringing forth the new. However, we must first learn traditional Chinese medicine. Without understanding traditional Chinese medicine, one is not qualified to criticize traditional Chinese medicine.
    Now, some hospitals in Beijing have begun to formally hire traditional Chinese medicine practitioners for clinical practice and to give lectures. I firmly believe that under the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a nationwide upsurge in learning traditional Chinese medicine will surely come, and the unity of Chinese and Western medicine will be further strengthened. On this basis, our country's medicine will surely achieve sound development.

    关键问题在于西医学习中医
　　傅连暲
    团结中西医，为人民服务，是毛主席早在十数年前即已明确指出的一项卫生工作方针。毛主席在“文化工作中的统一战线”一文中曾经教导我们说：“新医当然比旧医高明，但是新医如果不关心人民的痛苦，不为人民训练医生，不联合边区现有的一千多个旧医和旧式兽医，并帮助他们进步，那就是实际上帮助巫神，实际上忍心看着大批人畜的死亡。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷一○一○页）这一指示深刻地说明了中西医的团结合作，对于广大人民的健康，关系是如何的重大。全国解放以来，根据毛主席所指示的精神，团结中西医被订为新中国卫生工作的四大原则之一。多年来，我党中央和毛主席又曾在如何团结和帮助中医的问题上，在如何发扬和整理我们祖国的医学遗产的问题上，给予过很多具体的指示。如果我们认真地体会这些指示，认真地根据这些指示来进行工作，我们在发挥中医的作用上，在发扬我们祖国的医学遗产上，在丰富新中国医学的内容上，是一定会有很大收获的。然而，我们竟没有得到应有的收获。迄今为止，我国数十万的中医，可以说仍处在不被重视的地位。其原因在那里呢？在于我们卫生领导部门虽然把团结中西医做为自己的工作原则，实际上并没有认真贯彻这一原则。
    几年来，卫生部门在中医工作方面是做了一些工作的，例如开办中医进修学校，组织中医联合诊所和中医门诊部，推广针灸疗法等等。这些工作也取得了一些成绩。但是这些工作并没有从根本上解决发挥中医作用的问题。
    中华医学会也是如此。中华医学会总会曾经举行专题座谈会，邀请中医参加，并自去年组织了中西医学术交流委员会。但认真说来，这些也只是一些初步的皮毛的工作。在这方面，是还有许多应该做的工作而没有做的。中西医学术交流委员会仅做到使中西医在座谈会上彼此交流经验，距离中西医在工作上、在学术研究上真正沟通起来还很远。医院请中医看病会诊，迄今还是很少的；西医认真向中医请教，则是更少的了。自从全国解放以来，西医认真学习中国旧有的医学而获得一些成绩的，究竟有多少人呢？可以说是寥寥无几。绝大多数的西医一直没有把学习中医当做一件应该做的事来做，这不能不归咎于卫生行政领导部门和中华医学会的领导方面没有尽到领导责任。
    以我自己来说，我虽然和中医一起看过病，但没有把中国旧有医学当做自己的一门必修之课。我没有认真研读过中医的书籍。所以我至今在祖国旧有医学知识方面，还是一个门外汉。一个卫生工作的领导人，一个医学学术团体的领导人，对于自己祖国的旧有医学，茫无所知，说来是非常惭愧的。我应该老老实实地学习。
    我国医学已经有几千年的历史。中医对于我民族的延续发展，起了一定的保证作用。至今，我国几乎全部的农村居民和一半或者一半以上的城市居民还在靠中医看病。中医无论在过去和现在，对人民都有很大功劳。这是谁也不能否认的事实。这个事实有力地说明了中医在保健治疗上的实际有效作用。如果无视这个事实，当然是一种非科学的态度。如果不从这一事实出发来重视中医，团结中医，帮助中医，并且虚心向中医学习，那就是漠视人民的利益，那就谈不上关心人民的健康。
    具有悠久历史的我国旧有医学，是具有悠久历史的我国旧有文化的一个重要组成部分。我国旧有文化对于世界是有很大贡献的，而医学这一部分对于世界的贡献尤为突出。不仅在古代曾有不少国家向我国学习医学，就在现代，还有许多国家在研究我国旧有的医学。这也是谁也不能否认的事实。这个事实又有力地说明了我国旧有医学遗产具有非常丰富的宝藏，值得我们承受下来并且加以发展。如果无视这个事实，当然同样是一种非科学的态度。如果不从这一事实出发来认真学习、研究、整理我国旧有的医学，那实际上就是甘心把我们的祖先传流下来的宝贵遗产一概遗弃。那样，我们就对不起我国人民，对不起我们的祖先，对不起我们的后代。发扬我们祖国的医学遗产，以丰富我国新医学的内容，这一艰巨的责任是理应担负在我们这一代的肩上的。
    所以，我们对于团结中西医这一原则是否认真贯彻，是关系到我国人民健康的问题，是关系到我国医学发展的问题，是关系到我国对全世界人民的科学贡献的问题。很显然，任何一个医务工作者，都是应该严肃地对待这个问题的。
    过去我们曾经提倡中医进修，学习西医。这固然是必要的，然而还不是最重要的。党中央和毛主席指示我们说，现在的关键问题是西医学习中医。如果单纯强调中医学习西医，其结果是使中医完全变为西医，也就是丢掉中医，只要西医。唯有不仅中医学习西医而且特别强调西医学习中医，才能真正做到中医西医的互相贯通，最后发展为一个医。这一个医就是具有现代自然科学基础、吸收了古今中外一切医学成果的中国的新医学。过去，在我们的卫生领导部门中间，多数同志是没有认识到这一点的，是仅以创办中医进修学校为满足的。我自己也正是如此。中华医学会总会虽然曾号召中西医互相学习，但并没有组织西医有计划地学习中医。我认为，今后中华医学会总会应该协助卫生部，把组织西医学习中医这一任务，积极地担当起来。
    西医学习中医的主要思想障碍是瞧不起中医。这种瞧不起中医的想法必须打破。这种想法的产生，可能有两个原因。第一、认为一切都是外国的好，中国自己旧有的东西都要不得。这实际上是受了买办资产阶级思想影响的一种表现。固然，中国由于过去长期处于封建时代，工业和自然科学落后，因此，必须努力吸收外国的自然科学研究成果，这是非常必要的；为了发展新中国的科学，首先学习苏联的科学尤为必要，不如此，我们就要仍然处于落后的地位。但是，仅仅这样还不够，我们必须看到我国几千年来的文化遗产，是我国人民智慧创造的结果，在我国旧有的文化中间，是有许多精华的部分值得我们吸取的。不吸收外国的好的东西是不对的，看不见自己祖国原有的好的东西也是不对的。第二、认为只有现代的新的东西才是值得学习的，一切旧有的东西都不值得学习；认为中医已经过时了，已经落后了，因此可以完全不必学。这其实是一种违反科学的非历史的观点。那一门科学没有它的发展历史呢？那一门现代的科学不是吸收了历史上关于这一门的一切经验和研究成果而发展起来的呢？历史怎么能够割断呢？研究现代的文化是为了使现代的文化更向前发展。研究旧有的文化，吸取其精华，也是为了使现代的文化更向前发展。如果说现代的东西已经完全包括了过去的东西，那也不符合事实。对于过去的东西，我们还有很多没有弄清楚。对于中医，尤其是如此。中医的范围很广阔，我们究竟已经研究了多少呢？可以说是微乎其微的。事实已经证明，就是这微乎其微的已经研究过的东西，对于我们已经有很大的效用（如常山、槟榔、鸭瞻子、当归、益母草等药物研究、针灸研究等）；如果我们继续扩大对于中医的学习研究范围，把我国旧有医学所有一切宝藏都发掘出来，用之于人民，那将有多么巨大的收获！然而这桩巨大的工程，光靠西医是完不成的，光靠中医也是完不成的。必须互相学习，共同研究。现在尤其应该特别强调的是西医学习中医。
    有人认为中药可以学，中医不足学。这也是错误的想法。中药怎么能够和中医截然分开呢？许多中药治疗作用的发现不正是几千年来中医实践的结果吗？而且中医不仅包括用药。中医的其他治疗方法以及观察疾病的方法和对于病人的态度也有很多是值得我们学习的。
    当然，我们并不是说中医一切都好。对于我国旧有医学的吸收，是应该抱着推陈出新的批判态度的。然而，首先必须学习中医。不通晓中医就没有资格批判中医。
    现在，北京有些医院已经开始正式聘请中医临诊而且担任讲授。我深信，在党中央和毛主席的号召之下，全国性的学习中医的热潮必将来到，中西医的团结将有进一步的加强。在此基础上，我国的医学也必将获得健全的发展。
