Dear comrades and friends:

	We are delegated by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to participate in the grand celebration of the 5th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We feel very happy and honored.

	On behalf of the Government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we would like to extend our warmest congratulations to the Government and people of the People's Republic of China.

	Close friendship has long existed between the peoples of Vietnam and China. Since the success of the August Revolution in Vietnam and the liberation of the Chinese people, this profound friendship has become closer and developed on a new basis of internationalism. In the national liberation movement against foreign aggressors and in the struggle to restore peace in Indochina, the Vietnamese people have continuously received warm support from the Chinese people. This support has strengthened their determination and confidence in consolidating peace, achieving national unification, independence and democracy, and in the arduous task of defending peace in Asia and the world.

	The Vietnamese people are constantly encouraged by the achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects of national construction. They express their warmest celebration of and congratulations on the convening of the First Session of the First National People's Congress, the adoption of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and the unanimous election of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, as the Chairman of the People's Republic of China. The Vietnamese people regard the great victories won by the Chinese people as their own victories and as the victories of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

	The Vietnamese people are determined to further strengthen the fraternal friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China in order to complete the task of consolidating peace and achieving national unification, independence and democracy at an early date.

	Long live the great People's Republic of China!

	Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China!

	Long live the victory of the world socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    越南民主共和国政府代表团团长
    黄明鉴的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们受了越南民主共和国政府的委派，来参加庆祝中华人民共和国建国五周年国庆盛典，我们感到非常的欢欣和荣幸。
    我们谨代表越南民主共和国政府和人民向中华人民共和国政府和人民致最热烈的祝贺。
    越中两国人民间久已存在着密切的友谊。自从越南八月革命成功和中国人民获得解放以来，这种深厚的友谊在国际主义精神的新的基础上愈加密切和发展起来。越南人民在抗击外国侵略者的民族解放运动中，在争取恢复印度支那和平的斗争中，不断地得到中国人民的热烈支持。这种支持，使他们在巩固和平、实现全国统一、独立和民主以及在保卫亚洲和世界和平的艰巨事业中，加强了胜利的决心和信心。
    越南人民对中国人民在国家建设事业各方面的成就，经常感到鼓舞；对中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的召开，中华人民共和国宪法的通过，和一致推选中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志为中华人民共和国主席，表示最热烈的欢庆和祝贺。越南人民把中国人民获得的各种伟大胜利，看作是自己的胜利，看作是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的胜利。
    越南人民决心进一步加强越中两国人民间兄弟般的友谊，以便早日完成巩固和平、实现全国统一、独立和民主的任务。
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    越中两国人民坚如磐石的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营胜利万岁！
