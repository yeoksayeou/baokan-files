In order to help agricultural production cooperatives improve their accounting and financial management, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry held a training class for agricultural cooperative accountants in late September. 152 cadres from various special districts and counties responsible for establishing agricultural production cooperatives, 35 agricultural accountants from the suburbs of Xi'an, and farmers preparing to establish cooperatives, totaling 187 people, participated in the training. During the study, they listened to reports on issues such as financial management of agricultural cooperatives and learned how to formulate financial plans and establish financial accounting systems. In addition, in order to adapt to the current situation where the general farmers' education level is low and they cannot universally adopt new ledgers, the method of recording in old ledgers was improved with reference to the principles of the new ledgers. At the same time, they learned the methods of establishing, recording, posting, and closing accounts for both new and old ledgers. Now the participants have returned to their original locations and are focusing on helping one agricultural cooperative conduct an autumn harvest distribution experiment to prepare for the widespread training of agricultural cooperative accountants in various counties after the autumn harvest.

    陕西省训练一批农业生产合作社会计师资
    为了帮助农业生产合作社改进会计财务管理工作，陕西省农林厅于九月下旬举办了一期农业社会计师资训练班。参加训练的有各专区、各县负责建立农业生产合作社的干部一百五十二人，西安市郊区农业社会计和准备建社的农民三十五人，共计一百八十七人。学习中听了有关农业社财务管理等问题的报告，学习了制定财务计划与订定财务会计制度的办法。另外，为了适应目前一般农民文化程度低，还不能普遍采用新式账簿的情况，参照新式账簿的原理，改进了旧式账簿的记账方法。同时学习了新、旧两种账簿的建账、记账、过账、结账的方法。现在参加学习的人员都已返回原地，重点帮助一个农业社进行秋收分配试验工作，为秋后各县普遍训练农业社会计做好准备。
