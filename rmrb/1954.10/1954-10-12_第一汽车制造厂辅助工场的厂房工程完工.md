    Completion of Factory Buildings for the Auxiliary Workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant
    At the southeastern end of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, another magnificent factory building has been erected, which is the factory building for the auxiliary workshop. Currently, mechanical equipment is being installed inside this factory building. By November, various workshops of the auxiliary workshop will be put into production successively.
    The auxiliary workshop factory building is the second factory building built after the carpentry workshop factory building. The completion of the auxiliary workshop will greatly contribute to accelerating the construction of the automobile manufacturing plant and the preparation for production. This workshop houses mechanical repair, tool one, tool two, die, electrical repair, installation, heat treatment, boiler construction, and heating workshops. The variety of machine tools installed in them is rare among existing machinery factories in China. The two tool workshops will produce first, second, and third-level cutting tools, blades, jigs, and fixtures. In the future, most of the tens of thousands of tools used in the factory for manufacturing automobiles will be supplied by these two workshops, and some precision tools can only be manufactured here. In addition to being responsible for repairing various production equipment of the entire factory, the machine repair workshop will also manufacture hundreds of mechanical equipment for internal use by the end of this year and early next year, based on technical data supplied by the Soviet Union. The timing of the manufacture of these mechanical equipment directly affects the progress of the installation work in various workshops within the factory.
    At both ends of the auxiliary workshop factory building are three-story living quarters, which are now basically completed. The living quarters include workshop offices, clubs, rest rooms, canteens, and bathhouses.
    The construction of the auxiliary workshop began on July 21st last year. Over the past year, the workers responsible for the construction task have traveled a difficult road. During construction in the winter of last year, they braved severe cold of about minus 20 degrees Celsius to install and lift more than 800 tons of steel roof trusses. In March of this year, when the ground had not yet thawed, the workers used explosives to blast the soil layer, enabling the factory building to start construction ahead of schedule. Entering the summer, the workers intensified construction day and night, regardless of wind and rain. Many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members often led the masses to work as usual in heavy rain. Now, the builders have personally witnessed the fruits of their hard work over the past year and said happily: "Our efforts in wind and rain have not been in vain. We have finally built an auxiliary workshop for the country!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    第一汽车制造厂辅助工场的厂房工程完工
    在第一汽车制造厂的东南端，又有一座雄伟壮丽的厂房建立起来，这就是辅助工场的厂房。目前，这个厂房内正在安装机械设备，到十一月份，辅助工场的各个车间就将陆续投入生产了。
    辅助工场厂房是继木工场厂房之后建立起来的第二个厂房。辅助工场建成后，对于汽车制造厂的建设和生产准备工作的加速进行有很大作用。这个工场内设有机械修理、工具一、工具二、冲模、电气修理、安装、热处理、筑炉、热力等车间。它们所装置的各种机床之多，是我国现有机械工厂所少有的。两个工具车间将生产一、二、三级刀具、刃具、治具和卡具。将来全厂制造汽车所用的上万种工具，大部分由这两个车间供应，其中有些精密工具只有这里才能制造。机修车间除了担负检修全厂的各种生产设备外，在今年底和明年初要根据苏联供给的技术资料，制造几百台供厂内用的机械设备。这些机械设备制造的迟早，直接影响着厂内各车间安装工程的进度。
    在辅助工场厂房的两端，是三层楼房的生活间，现在也已基本完工。生活间里有车间办公室、俱乐部、休息室、食堂和浴池。
    辅助工场是在去年七月二十一日开始动工兴建的。一年多来，担负建设任务的职工们走过了艰苦的途程。在去年冬季施工中，他们曾冒着摄氏零下二十度左右的严寒，装吊了八百多吨钢屋架；今年三月间，大地尚未解冻，职工们用炸药爆破开土层，使厂房建筑能提前动工。转入夏季，工人们又不分昼夜、不避风雨地加紧施工，许多共产党员、青年团员时常在大雨中带领群众照常工作。现在，建设者们亲眼看见自己一年多来辛勤劳动的果实，高兴地说：风里雨里没白干，到底给国家建成了一座辅助工场！（新华社）
