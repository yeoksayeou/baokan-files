In 1950 and 1951, in accordance with the agreements reached between the Chinese and Soviet governments, four Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies were established based on the principle of equality:

	A company for mining non-ferrous and rare metals in Xinjiang Province, People's Republic of China;
	A company for mining and refining petroleum in Xinjiang Province, People's Republic of China;
	The Dalian Shipbuilding and Repair Company;
	A company for organizing and operating civil aviation routes.

At that time, the young People's Republic of China was facing the task of restoring the national economy. The establishment of the Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies, through the utilization of the Soviet Union's advanced experience in economic construction, made it possible in a short period of time to rectify the work of the enterprises under these companies, to greatly expand their production capacity, and to raise the general technical level. Therefore, the joint-stock companies have played a positive role and made a certain contribution in the cause of restoring and developing the Chinese economy.

Now that the People's Republic of China has restored its economy and is successfully implementing its first Five-Year Plan, China's economic departments have accumulated the necessary experience and are capable of managing the operations of the enterprises belonging to the joint-stock companies themselves. The Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Soviet Union have reached an agreement on the complete transfer of the Soviet shares in the Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies to the People's Republic of China, starting from January 1, 1955. The value of the Soviet shares will be repaid by the People's Republic of China by supplying the Soviet Union with goods that are normally exported over a period of several years.

Therefore, the enterprises that now belong to the Sino-Soviet joint-stock companies will become wholly state-owned enterprises of the People's Republic of China.

The two governments unanimously believe that this decision of both sides is in line with the friendly relations already established between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and will promote further consolidation of economic cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual assistance, and mutual respect for interests.

    中苏关于将各股份公司中的苏联股份移交给  中华人民共和国的联合公报
    在一九五○年和一九五一年，依照中国政府和苏联政府间所达成的协议，根据平等的原则创办了四个中苏股份公司：
    在中华人民共和国新疆省开采有色及稀有金属的公司；
    在中华人民共和国新疆省开采和提炼石油的公司；
    大连建造和修理轮船公司；
    组织和经营民用航空路线的公司。
    当时是年青的中华人民共和国面临着恢复国民经济任务的时期。各中苏股份公司的建立，由于利用苏联经济建设的先进经验，在短期内为整顿这些公司所属各企业的工作、为大大扩大它们的生产能力和为提高一般技术水平提供了可能性。因此，各股份公司在恢复和发展中国经济的事业中，已起了积极的作用，并作出了一定的贡献。
    现在，当中华人民共和国恢复了自己的经济以后，正在顺利地执行第一个五年计划的时候，中国的经济部门已积累了必要的经验，并且能够自己管理属于各股份公司的企业的业务。中华人民共和国政府和苏联政府已就各中苏股份公司中的苏联股份自一九五五年一月一日起完全移交给中华人民共和国一事达成了协议。苏联股份的价值，将由中华人民共和国以供应苏联通常出口货物的办法，在数年之内偿还。
    因此，现在属于各中苏股份公司的企业，将完全成为中华人民共和国的国营企业。
    两国政府一致认为，双方的这一决定符合于中华人民共和国和苏联之间已经建立起来的友好关系，并将在平等、互助、互相尊重利益的基础上，促进经济合作的进一步巩固。  一九五四年十月十二日
