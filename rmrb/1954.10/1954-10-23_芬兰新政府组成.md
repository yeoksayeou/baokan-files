Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki: According to TASS, after the resignation of the Ralf Törngren government on October 13, Urho Kekkonen, leader of the Finnish Agrarian League and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, formed a new government on October 20.

The official communique regarding the government's resignation stated that the Törngren government resigned because the Social Democratic Party and the Agrarian League in the government coalition disagreed with the economic program drafted by Törngren. However, the Finnish Communist Party's "People's Labor Daily" stated that the Törngren government resigned because right-wing groups were dissatisfied with the government's foreign and trade policies.

The new government is a coalition government of the Agrarian League and the Social Democratic Party, with Kekkonen as Prime Minister, Johannes Virolainen (Agrarian League) as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Väinö Leskinen (Social Democratic Party) as Minister of the Interior, and Emil Skog (Social Democratic Party) as Minister of Defense.

    芬兰新政府组成
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：在拉尔夫·陶格伦政府十月十三日辞职后，芬兰农民联盟领袖、前政府外交部长乌尔霍·吉科宁在十月二十日组成新政府。
    关于政府辞职的官方公报说，陶格伦政府辞职，是因为政府联盟中的社会民主党和农民联盟不同意陶格伦拟定的经济纲领。但是芬兰共产党的“劳动人民报”说，陶格伦政府辞职，是因为右翼集团不满政府的外交政策和贸易政策。
    新政府是农民联盟和社会民主党的联合政府，其中吉科宁任总理，约翰尼斯·维洛莱宁（农民联盟）任外交部长，瓦伊诺·勒斯基宁（社会民主党）任内政部长，埃米尔·斯科格（社会民主党）任国防部长。
