    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th: A Rangoon dispatch: The Rangoon People's Demonstration Against the Southeast Asia Treaty, convened by the Rangoon branch of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, was recently held in Rangoon. Participants included Burmese trade unions and other mass organizations, as well as members of parliament, senior monks, and people from all walks of life.

    U Swe Byu, chairman of the conference, said in his speech that the Southeast Asia Treaty, instigated by the United States for the purpose of war, endangers world peace, especially peace in Southeast Asia. The signing of this aggressive treaty will not only fail to ease international tensions but will, on the contrary, intensify them. U Swe Byu said that people all over the world oppose war and long for peace. He pointed out that Southeast Asian countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon have all refused to participate in this treaty. U Swe Byu called on the Burmese people to thoroughly oppose this aggressive treaty.

    The conference read out the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace's declaration against the Southeast Asia Treaty and passed a resolution calling on Asian countries to unite closely and jointly safeguard Asian security. A demonstration followed the meeting.

    The Mandalay, Sittwe, Hsipawni, and Letpadan branches of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace have also recently held rallies and launched signature campaigns to express their opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty.
