The Soviet Union Emphasizes the Issue of Middle School Graduates Participating in Labor Production
Jin Ling

I.

The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) instructed that ten-year education should be popularized in major cities during the Fifth Five-Year Plan and that preparations should be made to popularize ten-year education throughout the country during the next Five-Year Plan. This means that in the Soviet Union, in the near future, the national compulsory education for everyone will not be seven-year education but ten-year education. At that time, as Comrade Malenkov said, all the young Soviet generation participating in production will have a complete secondary education.

Raising from seven-year universal education to ten-year universal education is an important project in the Soviet Union's cultural construction. The number of students in the eighth to tenth grades of middle schools has increased rapidly since the 19th Congress of the CPSU, increasing by 1,307,000 in 1953 compared to 1952. This year, the number of students in the eighth, ninth, and tenth grades in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) alone increased by 536,000 compared to 1953. The increase in the number of students in the eighth to tenth grades has led to a corresponding increase in the number of ten-year middle school graduates. The number of middle school graduates in 1953 increased by 40% compared to 1952. Compared with 1953, it increased by 67% in cities and 82% in rural areas this year; the total number of middle school graduates reached 880,000 this year.

The increase in the number of middle school graduates is one of the significant signs of the improvement of the cultural level of socialist society. It makes it possible for all sectors of the national economy to obtain young people with higher cultural levels as labor reserves. It makes it possible for universities and technical schools to absorb more outstanding students. The phenomenon that the number of middle school graduates was not enough to supply secondary technical schools and universities during the first Five-Year Plan more than 20 years ago is now a thing of the past. However, with the rapid increase in the number of ten-year middle school graduates, the desire to enter universities is too great, and they cannot all be accommodated by universities. Of course, Soviet universities are also constantly developing, and their enrollment is increasing every year. For example, this year's enrollment has increased from 415,000 in 1953 (including 140,000 correspondence students) to 450,000 (including 160,000 correspondence students). The enrollment of universities will obviously continue to increase in the future. However, the rate of increase in university enrollment cannot keep up with the rate of increase in middle school graduates after all. According to Kirov, the Minister of Education of the RSFSR, the "gap between the number of middle school graduates and the number that universities can accommodate will continue to widen in the coming years." Therefore, encouraging middle school graduates who cannot enter universities to participate in production and continue to study in production has become the most important way to solve this problem. And middle school graduates participating in production is originally one of the goals of ten-year education. Because the Soviet national economy is developing by leaps and bounds, and Soviet production technology is becoming more and more advanced, a large number of new forces are needed to participate in production, and people with higher cultural levels are needed to master technology.

II.

The Soviet schools and national education authorities are solving the task of preparing students to participate in labor production in two ways: on the one hand, strengthening ideological education; on the other hand, improving teaching content.

Soviet public opinion believes that labor education, as an important part of communist moral education, has not been done well enough in the past. Shelepin, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol), criticized at the 12th Congress of the Komsomol in March this year: "Schools and the Komsomol have not done enough to cultivate students' labor habits, and rarely attract students to participate in labor within their capabilities. Rural schools have done a very poor job in cultivating students' yearning and interest in agricultural labor." He said: Often some Young Pioneer and Komsomol workers, and even some teachers, also tell children, you study hard, and you will definitely become a scholar, engineer, or writer in the future, but they do not arouse their interest in becoming a skilled worker, technician, or tractor driver. The editorial of the fourth issue of "Soviet Education" magazine also criticized the "widespread" view that middle school graduates must go to university and become chemists, doctors, architects, etc., rather than fitters, turners, or combine harvesters. In his paper published in the "Pravda" on June 26, Dilenko, the Director of the Central Administration of Labor Reserves under the Council of Ministers of the USSR, criticized many schools for being very fond of organizing meetings between people in the scientific and artistic circles and students, but never inviting production innovators to have discussions with students.

In this situation, it is easy for students to have incorrect views on labor. Shelepin said that there are still some "little white hands" among children, "they will not, and sometimes are unwilling to do the slightest things for themselves, to help with household chores." The incorrect view of labor, as an article in the "Izvestia" on June 19 said, will cultivate a one-sided worldview in some young people. "So one-sided that sometimes, in order to get some young people to go to factories, construction projects, mines, mining areas, transportation enterprises, and agricultural machinery stations and state farms to embark on the extremely honorable positions where their parents are, persuasive mobilization work has to be done."

Therefore, Soviet schools today pay special attention to overcoming this shortcoming in labor education. Kirov said in his article "The Tasks of Soviet Schools" that because schools used to only prepare students for universities, but now they must prepare them to participate in practical work, "now schools have a special and major task of transforming students' psychology." In addition to promoting comprehensive technical education, teachers should also use various methods outside the classroom to explain the important significance of labor to students.

Since recently, the Soviet press and radio have used great efforts to carry out social education to encourage middle school graduates to participate in production. Articles explaining the glory of labor, news of middle school graduates deciding to participate in production, vivid introductions of the work, study, and life of middle school graduates who have already participated in production and their own thoughts and experiences, and inspiring talks by labor heroes who have been tempered in practical work often appear in newspapers and periodicals. At the same time, newspapers and periodicals also patiently, but sternly, criticized certain views that despise labor.

In addition to generally promoting the glory of labor and mobilizing young people to participate in production, the Soviet press has also published many articles explaining that the knowledge young people have learned in middle school can be applied in production, and that creative labor in modern enterprises requires a high level of culture. An article in the "Izvestia" on June 19 said that many people still use the old concept to imagine the current occupations, and do not understand that the progress of production technology has required workers to have a high level of culture. For example, people think that a painter is a person who works with a brush in a room full of paint, but in fact, the current painter is standing next to an automatically rotating car in a bright hall, paying attention to the air pressure of the air-sprayed paint, and managing the instruments for regulating concentration and temperature. Such a painter, like many other workers in occupations that still use old names, can no longer be without culture.

Soviet middle school graduates can continue to study without leaving production after participating in production, and still have broad prospects for development. The socialist country not only cares about the material life of workers, but also cares about the improvement of their cultural and technical level. Therefore, enterprises always try their best to create good conditions for workers to study. In the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow, there are two night middle schools, one two-shift middle school, one automobile machinery secondary technical night school, one automobile machinery night institute, and one machine manufacturing correspondence institute. In order to help employees prepare for the entrance examinations for secondary technical night schools and night institutes, preparatory classes are also specially opened. More than 11% of the employees in the factory are studying in these schools. In addition, there are various groups to improve proficiency. Under such conditions, many workers have received higher education. Ulekov, the chief engineer of the general technology department of the "Red Sormovo" factory in Gorky, came to the factory in 1941 and worked as a fitter after a short training. For the past 13 years, he has worked while studying at the secondary technical night school and the night institute. Akiminko, the chief of the thermal engineering section of the general power department, graduated from the correspondence engineering institute in the factory, and wrote a thesis without leaving production, and obtained a master's degree in technical science a year ago. In the past academic year, 7.5 million workers in the Soviet Union improved their proficiency through training classes and apprenticeship groups in factories, 1.3 million people studied in workers' youth middle schools, and tens of thousands of people graduated from secondary technical schools and universities without leaving production.

Of course, it is more difficult to work while studying. But the "college students" in the factory also have advantages, they have practical knowledge. The knowledge learned in school can be applied to work immediately, and production practice in turn helps them to actively and creatively master science. Korshunov, who went to work at the "Fighter" factory in Moscow after graduating from middle school last year, said: "Now I am already a sophomore in college. I am studying in the petroleum machinery department, and our factory produces many machines and machinery for the petroleum industry: pumps, compressors, turbo drills, etc. So in practice, I can not only understand the structure of various machines, but also participate in the manufacture of these machines as a turner."

Therefore, it can often be seen in the Soviet press: "Direct production labor has widely opened the road to the peak of knowledge." This sentence does contain profound truth. After many young people participated in production, they quickly mastered the technology, and many of them became advanced workers. Solotilin of the Leningrad Hardware Factory was not long ago an electrician repairing lathes, and is now a staff member of the hydraulic laboratory. Travgin started as a driller and is now a senior engineer who can participate in the production of automatic control drawings for the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station. As for the turner Kolesov giving reports in scientific research institutes, and the combine harvester Osigin teaching at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, they are even more well-known.

The organizations of the Communist Youth League and trade unions also conduct labor production education for young students. They organize young students and advanced workers to hold discussions, and help many production enterprises hold "open days". "Open days" were originally a tradition in Soviet universities, where professors introduce the characteristics and majors of their schools to tenth-grade students to help them decide on their direction of further education. This year, many factories have also followed this approach to attract middle school graduates to work in their factories. The "Red Aksai" factory in Rostov, the printing machinery factory in Sherbakov, and the "Electricity" factory in Leningrad have all held "open days", inviting middle school graduates to the factory's workshops to introduce them to complex machinery and various different types of work, and to tell them about the labor achievements of the workers. "Open days" have had a great effect, and many young students have decided to participate in production labor after visiting the factory on this day.

III.

The other aspect of strengthening the task of preparing students to participate in production labor is to improve teaching content.

Teaching content plays a role in giving students basic production knowledge and arousing students' desire to engage in labor. The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulated that comprehensive technical education should be started in middle schools and gradually transition to the popularization of comprehensive technical education, requiring students to master a solid and systematic scientific foundation of knowledge, while also understanding the basics of modern industrial and agricultural production, and possessing the abilities and habits necessary for future practical work.

In order to do this, Soviet middle and primary schools will adopt new teaching plans, syllabuses and textbooks starting from the new academic year this year. Due to the large changes, a lot of preparation work needs to be done, so it will take three years for the new teaching plans, syllabuses and textbooks to be uniformly adopted in all grades of schools across the country. The new teaching plans and syllabuses first of all increase the number of teaching hours for physics and chemistry, and extend the learning time for plants and animals. At the same time, the Russian language course is simplified and reduced. The number of teaching hours for literature, history, the Soviet Constitution, geography, the basis of Darwinism, psychology, and foreign languages has also been greatly reduced. Because the number of teaching hours for many subjects has been reduced, it is possible to free up time for labor education without increasing the total study time. There is manual labor from the first to fourth grades, internship workshops and school practice garden courses from the fifth to seventh grades, and in addition to internship workshops and school practice garden from the eighth to tenth grades, students must also go to local enterprises, agricultural machinery stations, and farms to carry out internships in agriculture, mechanics, and electrical engineering. The content of each subject is also more closely integrated with practice. For example, the number of experiments in physics and chemistry has increased, and subjects such as physics, chemistry, and biology should allow students to understand how the laws of these sciences are applied to modern industrial and agricultural production, and enable students to develop comprehensive technical practical work skills. Practical work such as abacus calculation and measurement has been added to the mathematics class. In the drawing class, reading and drawing technical sketches and surveying and mapping object diagrams occupy an important position. In this way, as the editorial in the "Pravda" on August 4 said: "Many subjects adopt new syllabuses and improve existing syllabuses, which can improve the teaching of the foundations of various sciences, make school education closer to practical needs, and cultivate students' labor habits", and "improve the training work for students to participate in future practical activities."

In order to adapt to the situation of ten-year middle school graduates participating in production, and also to make it easier for them to quickly participate in production after a short period of technical study, some changes have been made in the current Soviet vocational education system and labor reserve system. First, secondary technical schools are preparing to gradually change the enrollment targets from seventh-grade graduates to tenth-grade graduates in the next few years, and shorten the study period from three or four years to two to two and a half years. This change has been tested and has been successful in the coal mining industry, the machine manufacturing industry, the ferrous metal smelting industry, and agriculture. This year, 440,000 students have been enrolled in secondary technical schools, of which 160,000 are tenth-grade graduates. They can be trained as secondary technical cadres in a shorter period of time.

Secondly, the Central Administration of Labor Reserves under the Soviet Union is preparing to open 250 technical schools, enrolling tenth-grade graduates, and training workers and elementary technical personnel for 76 complex specialties in various sectors of the national economy, of which 51 specialties have a study period of one year, four have a study period of one and a half years, and 21 have a study period of two years. The state provides very preferential treatment for students in this type of technical school. Students can receive study stipends, and students from other places can stay for free. The state provides clothing and food for orphans and children of disabled veterans of the Patriotic War. Students with excellent grades have the right to be admitted with priority when they enter night colleges or correspondence colleges after graduation. Students in this type of technical school should listen to the state's assignment for three years after graduation.

This type of technical school will start classes on November 1, and preparations are currently being actively carried out. The Central Administration of Labor Reserves under the Soviet Union has begun to formulate teaching plans and syllabuses for students of each type of work. Technical schools generally have certain enterprises as the basis for their production internships, and engineers and technicians from these enterprises serve as production coaches and teachers. At present, the Central Administration of Labor Reserves is working with the relevant enterprises to urgently repair school buildings, recruit teachers, and allocate equipment and instruments and tools for learning. The "Komsomolskaya Pravda" in August specially opened a column "Talking with Middle School Graduates", and successively invited heads of various government ministries to publish articles introducing the technical schools opened on the basis of enterprises in their departments, introducing the types of work they train and the learning conditions.

In addition to the above two types of schools, various enterprise departments have also opened some training classes. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture will hold a two-month training class, enrolling 10,000 middle school graduates, and training fuel supply statisticians for tractor teams. Factories have also adapted to the level of tenth-grade graduates and made some changes to the original vocational education attached to factories and separated from production. For example, the Stalin Automobile Factory changed the three-month vocational education to six months to train middle school graduates who have just entered the factory to become workers with complex technical specialties. In addition, the various proficiency improvement groups, apprenticeship groups, or individual apprenticeship methods that originally existed in enterprises will also play a considerable role in training middle school graduates to participate in production.

Hundreds of thousands of middle school graduates have taken or are about to take up production posts for the first time this year, participating in labor in industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture. After this group, more and more middle school graduates will directly participate in production every year in the future. They will not only strengthen the ranks of the working people in the socialist country, improve the cultural and technical level and labor productivity of all members of society, but also continue to grow in production labor and gradually become builders of a communist society that combines intellectual labor with physical labor.

    苏联重视中学毕业生参加劳动生产的问题
    金陵
    一
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，曾经指示要在第五个五年计划期间在大城市中普及十年制教育，并准备在下一个五年计划期间在全国普及十年制教育。这就是说，在苏联，在不久的将来，作为人人必受的国民义务教育，将不是七年制教育，而是十年制教育。那时候，正如马林科夫同志所说，所有参加生产的苏联青年一代，都将具有完全的中等教育程度了。
    从七年制普及教育提高到十年制普及教育，这正是苏联文化建设中的重要项目。中学八年级到十年级的学生人数，在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会之后迅速地增长着，一九五三年便比一九五二年增加了一百三十万零七千人。今年仅俄罗斯联邦共和国八、九、十年级的学生，就比一九五三年增加了五十三万六千人。八年级至十年级学生人数的增加，使十年制中学毕业生也相应地增多。一九五三年的中学毕业生比一九五二年增加了百分之四十，今年与一九五三年相较，在城市中增加了百分之六十七，在乡村中增加了百分之八十二；今年全部中学毕业生达到八十八万。
    中学毕业生的增加，是社会主义社会文化程度提高的显著标志之一。它使国民经济各生产部门有可能得到文化程度较高的青年作为劳动后备。它使高等学校和技术学校有可能吸收更多的优秀学生。二十多年前，第一个五年计划时期，中学毕业生不够供应中等技术学校和高等学校的现象，现在是永远过去了。但是，随着十年制中学毕业生的迅速增加，愿望进入高等学校的过多，他们不可能全部为高等学校所容纳。固然，苏联高等学校也在不断发展，它的招生人数每年也在增加。例如，今年的招生人数便从一九五三年的四十一万五千（内函授生十四万）增加到四十五万（内函授生十六万）。高等学校的招生人数今后显然还要继续增加。但是高等学校招生人数增加的速度毕竟不可能赶上中学毕业生增加的速度。据俄罗斯联邦共和国教育部部长凯罗夫估计，中学毕业生人数和高等学校所能容纳人数之间的“差额在今后几年中将要不断增大。”因此，鼓励不能升学的中学毕业生参加生产，在生产中继续学习，便成为解决这个问题的最主要的办法。而中学毕业生参加生产，这本来是十年制教育的目的之一。因为苏联国民经济突飞猛进地发展，苏联生产技术一天比一天发达，需要大量生力军参加生产，需要文化水平更高的人去掌握技术。二
    准备学生参加劳动生产的任务，苏联学校和国民教育机关是从两方面去解决的：一方面是加强思想教育；另一方面是改善教学内容。
    苏联社会舆论认为，作为共产主义道德教育的一个重要组成部分的劳动教育，过去做得不够。苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记谢列平在今年三月间举行的青年团第十二次代表大会上批评说：“学校、青年团对培养学生的劳动习惯做得不够，很少吸引学生参加能力所及的劳动。乡村学校培养学生对农业劳动的向往和兴趣做得很差。”他说：往往有些少先队、青年团的工作者，甚至还有些教员，也对孩子说，你好好学习，将来一定成个学者、工程师、作家，可是却不去唤起他们作一个熟练工人、技工、拖拉机手的兴趣。第四期“苏联教育”杂志的社论也批评了“迄今为止广泛流行”的意见，即以为中学毕业生一定要升大学，成为化学家、医生、建筑师等，而不是锉工、镟工、联合收割机手。“真理报”六月二十六日发表的苏联部长会议中央劳动后备力管理局局长季连科的论文中，批评了许多学校非常喜欢组织科学界、艺术界人士和学生见面，却从来不邀请生产革新者来和学生座谈。
    在这种情形下，容易使学生对劳动产生不正确的看法。谢列平说，儿童中还有一些“小白手”，“他们不会，有时是不愿为自己作些最轻微的事情，帮助料理家务。”对于劳动的不正确看法，也就如同六月十九日“消息报”一篇论文所说，会养成某些青年的片面世界观。“片面得这般严重，以致有时为了要某些青年人到工厂、建筑工程、矿井、矿山、运输事业中，到农业机器站和国营农场中去踏上父母们所在的极其荣誉的岗位，都不得不做说服动员工作。”
    因此，苏联学校今天特别注意克服劳动教育中的这种缺点。凯罗夫在“苏联学校的任务”一文中说，由于学校过去只是准备学生进大学，而现在则要准备他们参加实际工作，所以“现在学校面前便有一项特殊的改造学生心理的重大任务。”除了推行综合技术教育，教员还应该在课堂以外，利用各种方法，向学生解释劳动的重要意义。
    苏联报刊和广播最近以来，用了很大力量，进行了鼓励中学毕业生参加生产的社会教育。说明劳动光荣的文章，中学毕业生决定参加生产的消息，已经参加生产的中学毕业生的工作、学习、生活情况的生动介绍和他们自己的感想和体会，从实际工作中锻炼出来的劳动英雄们鼓舞人心的谈话，都经常出现在报刊上面。同时，报刊也耐心地，但却严厉地批评了某些轻视劳动的看法。
    除了一般地宣传劳动光荣、动员青年参加生产以外，苏联报刊还发表了许多文章，解释青年在中学所学的知识，可以在生产中应用，说明要在现代企业中创造性地劳动，必须具有高度文化水平。六月十九日“消息报”一篇文章说，许多人还用从前的概念来想像现在的职业，不了解生产技术的进步已经要求工人具有高度文化水平。例如，人们以为漆匠就是拿着刷子在满是漆垢的屋子里工作的，但实际上现在的漆匠却在明净的大厅里，站在自动转动的汽车旁边，注意气喷油漆的气压，管理调节浓度和温度的器械。这样的漆匠，正如许多沿用旧名称的其他职业的工人一样，便不能再没有文化了。
    苏联中学毕业生在参加生产之后，还可以不脱离生产继续学习，仍然有远大的发展前途。社会主义的国家不但关怀劳动者的物质生活，而且关怀他们文化技术水平的提高。因此各企业总是尽力为工人的学习创造良好的条件。在莫斯科的斯大林汽车工厂里，便开办有两所夜间中学，一所两班制的中学，一所汽车机械中等技术夜校，一所汽车机械夜间学院，一所机器制造函授学院。为了帮助员工们准备中等技术夜校和夜间学院的入学考试，还特别开设了预备班。全厂有百分之十一以上的员工在这些学校学习。此外还有各种各样的提高熟练程度小组。就在这样的条件下，许多工人受到了高等教育。高尔基市“红色索尔莫沃”工厂总工艺处的主要工程师乌雷科夫，一九四一年来到工厂经过短期训练后才作一个钳工，十三年来他一面工作，一面读完了中等技术夜校和夜间学院。总动力处热力工程科科长阿基明科在工厂里读完函授工学院，又不脱离生产地写了论文，一年前取得了技术科学硕士的学位。过去这一个学年，苏联有七百五十万工人经工厂中的训练班和小组带徒弟、个别带徒弟的方法，提高了熟练程度，一百三十万人在工人青年中学学习，几万人不脱离生产毕业于中等技术学校和高等学校。
    当然，一面工作一面学习是比较困难的。但是工厂里的“大学生”们也有长处，他们有实践的知识。学校里学得的知识立刻可以在劳动中运用，而生产实践又反过来帮助他们积极地、创造性地掌握科学。去年读完中学后到莫斯科“战士”工厂作工的科尔舒诺夫说：“现在我已经是大学二年级学生了，我在石油机械系学习，而我们的工厂则出产许多石油工业的机器和机械：唧筒、压缩器、透平钻孔器等。所以我在实践中不仅能了解各种机器的构造，而且作为一个镟工，还能够参加制造这些机器。”
    因此，苏联报刊上常常可以看到：“直接的生产劳动广泛地开辟了通往知识高峰的大道”。这句话里的确包含着深刻的真理。许多青年参加生产以后，很快地掌握了技术，有许多还成了先进工作者。列宁格勒五金厂的索洛季林不久前还是一名修理车床的电工，现在已经是水力试验室的工作人员。特拉夫庚开始是一名钻工，现在已是高级工程师，能够参加制作古比雪夫水电站自动操纵图了。至于镟工科列索夫在科学研究所中作报告，联合收割机手奥西庚在季米里亚泽夫农学院教书，更是无人不晓的了。
    青年团、工会的组织也对青年学生进行劳动生产教育。它们组织青年学生和先进工人举行座谈，帮助许多生产企业举行“开放日”。“开放日”本来是苏联的高等学校里的一种传统，就是教授们向十年级学生介绍自己学校的特点和专业，帮助他们决定升学方向。今年有许多工厂也仿效这个办法，以吸引中学毕业生来自己工厂工作。罗斯托夫的“红色阿克赛”工厂、谢尔巴科夫的印刷机器制造厂、列宁格勒的“电力”工厂等，都举行过“开放日”，邀请中学毕业生到工厂的车间来，向他们介绍复杂的机械和各种不同的工种，叙述工人的劳动功绩。“开放日”的作用很大，许多青年学生在这一天参观工厂后决定参加生产劳动。三
    加强准备学生参加生产劳动的任务的另一方面，是要改善教学内容。
    教学内容在给予学生以基本的生产知识，以及引起学生从事劳动的愿望上，都起很大的作用。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会曾规定在中学里着手实行综合技术教育，并逐渐过渡到普及综合技术教育，要求学生掌握牢固的系统的科学基础知识，同时又了解现代工农业生产的基础，拥有为未来实际工作所必须的能耐和习惯。
    为了做到这一点，苏联中、小学从今年新学年开始要采用新的教学计划、课程大纲和教科书。由于变动较大，需要进行许多准备工作，所以需要三年时间才能在全国学校的各个年级中一律采用新的教学计划、课程大纲和教科书。新的教学计划和课程大纲首先是要增加物理、化学的授课时数，延长植物、动物的学习时间。同时，俄语课则予简化并缩减。文学、历史、苏联宪法、地理、达尔文主义基础、心理学、外国语各科的授课时数也大大减少。由于缩减了许多学科的授课时数，所以可以不增加总的学习时间而腾出时间进行劳动教育。一年级到四年级有手工劳动，五年级到七年级有实习工场和学校实习园地的课程，八年级到十年级除了实习工场和学校实习园地以外，还要到当地的企业、农业机器站、农庄去就农业、机械学、电工技术进行实习。各科的内容也更多与实际结合。例如，物理、化学的实验时数增多了，物理、化学、生物等科要让学生了解这些科学的规律如何应用于现代工、农业生产，并使学生养成综合技术性的实际工作技能。数学课中增加了珠算、测量等实际工作。图画课中技术草图的看图和绘制以及物体图的测绘占了重要位置。这样，正如八月四日“真理报”社论所说：“许多学科采用新的课程大纲和改进现有的课程大纲，可以改善各门科学基础的教授，使学校教育接近于实践需要，培养学生的劳动习惯”，而“改善对学生参加未来实践活动的培养工作。”
    为了适应十年制中学毕业生参加生产的情况，同时也为了便于他们能够在一个短时期的技术学习之后迅速参加生产，目前苏联职业教育系统、劳动后备系统中都作了一些改变。首先，中等技术学校准备在最近几年中逐渐把招生对象从七年级毕业生改变成十年级毕业生，而把学习期限由三、四年缩短到两年至两年半。这种改变在煤矿工业、机器制造工业、黑色金属冶炼工业和农业中，已经作了试验并已获得成功。今年中等技术学校招生四十四万名，内十年级毕业生已达十六万名。他们在较短期限内便可被培养成为中等技术干部。
    其次，苏联中央劳动后备力管理局准备开办二百五十所技术学校，招收十年级毕业生，为国民经济各部门中的七十六种复杂专业培养工人和初等技术人员，其中五十一种专业学习期限为一年，四种学习一年半，二十一种学习两年。国家对于这种技术学校的学生非常优待。学生都可以领得学习津贴，外地学生还可免费住宿。孤儿和卫国战争残废的子弟的衣、食都由国家供给。成绩优良的学生毕业后进入夜间学院或函授学院时，享有优先录取的权利。这种技术学校的学生毕业后应听从国家分配工作三年。
    这种技术学校将在十一月一日开始上课，现在正积极进行准备工作。苏联中央劳动后备力管理局已经着手为每一工种的学生订立教学计划和课程大纲。技术学校一般都有一定的企业为其生产实习的基础，并由这些企业的工程技术人员担任生产教练员和教员。目前中央劳动后备力管理局正会同各有关企业紧张地修理校舍、物色教员、分配装备和学习用的器械和工具。八月份的“共青团真理报”专辟“与中学毕业生谈话”一栏，连续请政府各部首长发表文章介绍在本部门企业基础之上开设的技术学校，介绍其培养的工种和学习条件。
    除了以上两种学校，各企业部还开办了一些训练班。例如农业部便要举办两个月的训练班，招收
  一万名中学毕业生，培养拖拉机队的燃料供给统计员。工厂中也适应十年级毕业生的程度，将原有的工厂附属脱离生产的职业教育作一些改变。例如斯大林汽车工厂把三月制的职业教育改成六月制，以培养初进厂的中学毕业生成为复杂技术的专业的工人。此外，企业中原有的各种提高熟练程度小组，小组带徒弟或个人带徒弟的办法，在培养中学毕业生参加生产方面，也仍将起相当重要的作用。
    数十万中学毕业生今年第一次大批地踏上了或即将踏上生产岗位，参加工业、建筑业、运输业、农业中的劳动。在这一批之后，将来每年都会有愈来愈多的中学毕业生直接参加到生产中来。他们不仅使社会主义国家劳动人民的队伍得以壮大，使社会全体成员的文化技术水平和劳动生产率得以提高，而且他们自己也将在生产劳动中继续成长，逐渐成为智力劳动同体力劳动相结合的共产主义社会建设者。
