Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The first National Political Work Conference of the Ministry of Geology of the People's Republic of China decided to further strengthen the Party's political work in the geological exploration system in order to ensure the successful completion of the increasingly heavy national geological exploration tasks. The conference was held from September 10th to 27th, with the participation of more than 160 cadres from the political organs of the various geological bureaus and geological exploration teams under the Ministry of Geology, as well as cadres from the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade unions.

The conference reviewed and summarized the political work of the Ministry of Geology system over the past two years, and focused on studying the characteristics of the geological departments and the nature and basic tasks of the Party's political organs. The conference pointed out that the political departments of the Ministry of Geology are the organs for carrying out political work in the Ministry of Geology system, and its main task is to realize the Party's guarantee and supervision of production work through systematic political work. The conference believed that according to this standard, the past political work had achieved results, basically guaranteeing the completion of the national geological exploration tasks, improving the political awareness of the vast number of workers and staff, and cultivating a large number of model figures. However, there were also many shortcomings in the past political work, such as the weak ideological education of workers and staff, insufficient breadth and depth of organizational work, insufficient close integration of political work and production work, and a lack of unified leadership and strong support for trade unions and Communist Youth League organizations. The conference believed that the emergence of these shortcomings was mainly due to the imperfect political work institutions and the lack of clear understanding of the nature and basic tasks of the Party's political organs by many cadres. Based on the increasingly heavy geological exploration tasks of the geological departments and the continuous expansion of the geological exploration teams, the conference pointed out that the political organs must gradually overcome the shortcomings in their work and further strengthen the guarantee and supervision of geological exploration work. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of workers and staff, carry out criticism and self-criticism, improve the socialist consciousness of the vast number of workers and staff, and better integrate ideological leadership with various business tasks to ensure the timely and effective completion of production tasks. At the same time, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the trade unions and the Communist Youth League, and give full play to the role of the trade unions and the Communist Youth League in connecting with and educating the masses. The conference believed that the main task of the Ministry of Geology at present is to complete the geological exploration tasks of 1954 and hand over the mineral resources needed for national construction according to national requirements. The political organs must organize the vast number of workers and staff to carry out labor competitions to ensure the victorious completion of this task.

The conference pointed out that because geological exploration work is very scattered, highly mobile, and often carried out in remote areas, and the composition and withdrawal of exploration teams are very frequent, it is necessary to establish and improve unified political work organs in order to successfully complete the tasks of political work. The conference decided that geological exploration teams with more than 500 employees should set up political sections, and units with fewer than 200 employees should set up political assistant offices or political instructors. In addition, political work cadres should strengthen their studies, improve the quality of their work, and establish a good work style of being down-to-earth and closely linked to the masses.

    加强党对地质勘探工作的保证和监督
    地质部举行政治工作会议
    【新华社七日讯】中华人民共和国地质部全国第一次政治工作会议决定进一步加强地质勘探系统党的政治工作，以便保证日益繁重的国家地质勘探任务胜利完成。会议在九月十日到二十七日举行，参加会议的有地质部所属各地质局、地质勘探队党的政治机关工作干部和党、青年团、工会的干部共一百六十多人。
    会议检查和总结了两年来地质部系统的政治工作，并集中地研究了地质部门的特点以及党的政治机关的性质和基本任务。会议指出：地质部的政治部门是党在地质部系统内进行政治工作的机关，它的主要任务是通过系统的政治工作实现党对生产工作的保证和监督。会议认为根据这一标准检查，过去的政治工作是有成绩的，基本上保证了国家地质勘探任务的完成，提高了广大职工的政治觉悟，并培养了大批模范人物。但是过去政治工作也存在很多缺点，例如对职工的思想教育工作很薄弱，组织工作不够广泛和深入，政治工作和生产工作结合不够密切，对工会和青年团组织缺乏统一的领导和有力的支持等。会议认为这些缺点的产生主要是因为政治工作机构不健全以及许多干部对党的政治机关的性质和基本任务认识不明确。会议根据地质部门地质勘探任务日益繁重、地质勘探队伍不断扩大等情况，指出政治机关必须逐步克服工作中的缺点，进一步加强对地质勘探工作的保证和监督。为此，就要加强对职工的思想教育工作，开展批评和自我批评，提高广大职工的社会主义觉悟，并使思想领导更好地和各项业务工作密切结合起来，及时、有力地保证生产任务的完成。同时在党委统一的领导下，加强对工会和青年团的领导，充分发挥工会、青年团联系群众、教育群众的作用。会议认为当前地质部的主要任务是完成一九五四年的地质勘探任务，按照国家要求交出国家建设所需要的矿产资源。政治机关必须组织广大职工开展劳动竞赛，保证胜利地完成这一任务。
    会议指出：由于地质勘探工作十分分散、流动性很大，并且常常在偏僻地区进行工作，勘探队伍的组成与撤销很频繁，因此必须建立和健全统一的政治工作机关，才能很好地完成政治工作的任务。会议决定有五百职工以上的地质勘探队设立政治处，有二百职工以下的单位要设立政治协理员办公室或政治指导员。此外，政治工作干部要加强学习，提高自己的工作质量，并树立起脚踏实地、密切联系群众的优良的工作作风。
