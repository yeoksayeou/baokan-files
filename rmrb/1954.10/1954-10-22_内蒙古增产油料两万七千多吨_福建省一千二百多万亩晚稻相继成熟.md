　　Inner Mongolia Increases Oil Crop Production by More Than 27,000 Tons
　　More Than 12 Million Mu of Late Rice in Fujian Province Ripens Successively

　　Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved a bumper harvest of oil crops on more than 5 million mu this year. At present, sesame, castor, rapeseed, hemp seed, sunflower and other crops have been harvested. It is estimated that the region's oil crop production will increase by more than 27,000 tons compared with last year. Among them, the yield of more than 2.5 million mu of sesame will exceed the original plan by more than 5%, with an increase of more than 16 jin per mu compared with last year.
　　This spring, farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region responded to the call of the state and actively planted oil crops. In the western region, where sesame is mostly planted, most farmers achieved timely early planting and reasonable close planting. Many farmers changed the old habit of not planting sesame in good fields, planting sesame in fields that were turned over last autumn, and applying fertilizer and weeding, so that the crops were full of grains and matured early. Many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups and individual farmers in Liangcheng, Zhuozi and other counties, with the help of technical extension stations and demonstration farms, also tried planting Soviet sesame seeds with high yield, cold resistance and early maturity, and the results were good.

　　More than 12 million mu of late rice in Fujian Province have ripened successively, and more than 4 million mu of late rice in Yong'an and Jianyang prefectures, which ripened earlier, have begun to be harvested.
　　This year, the late rice in various parts of Fujian Province generally grew well. Farmers in various places have made various preparations to harvest more grain and strive for every grain to return home. Jianyang and Yong'an prefectures, as well as Sha County, Shunchang, Youxi and other counties, through experienced farmers and agricultural technicians, have researched and developed methods for careful harvesting and proposed the slogan of harvesting three to five jin of grain more per mu, striving to harvest about 20 million jin more grain in 5 million mu of late rice fields. Each agricultural production cooperative and mutual aid group in Xiyuan Township, Jianning County, which has already started harvesting, has found more than five ways to harvest carefully, and is driving farmers to strive to overfulfill the original production increase plan by 26,000 jin.

    内蒙古增产油料两万七千多吨
    福建省一千二百多万亩晚稻相继成熟
    内蒙古自治区今年五百多万亩油料作物获得丰收。目前，各地芝麻、蓖麻、菜籽、大麻籽、向日葵等已收割完毕，预计全区油料产量比去年增产两万七千多吨。其中二百五十多万亩芝麻，产量将超过原计划百分之五以上，每亩比去年增产十六斤多。
    今年春天，自治区各族农民响应国家号召，积极种植了油料作物。在种植芝麻最多的西部地区，农民们大部做到了适时早种、合理密植，许多农民改变了过去好茬不种芝麻的旧习惯，把芝麻种在去年秋天翻过的田地里，并施肥锄草，使作物籽粒饱满，早期成熟。凉城、卓资等县很多农业生产合作社、互助组及单干农民，在技术推广站和示范农场的帮助下，还试种了苏联产量高耐寒早熟的芝麻籽种，效果良好。（新华社）
    福建省一千二百多万亩晚稻相继成熟，成熟较早的永安、建阳两专区四百多万亩晚稻已开始收割。
    今年福建省各地晚稻一般都生长良好，各地农民为了多打粮食，进行了各种准备，争取颗粒还家。建阳、永安两专区和沙县、顺昌、尤溪等县，通过有经验的农民和农业技术员研究出精打细收办法，提出每亩多打三、五斤粮食的口号，争取在五百万亩晚稻田里多收获二千万斤左右的粮食。已开镰收割的建宁县溪源乡各个农业生产合作社和互助组找出五种以上的精打细收办法，正带动农民争取超额二万六千斤完成原订增产计划。（新华社）
