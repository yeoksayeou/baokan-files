    Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant Actively Prepares for Production Transfer
    Our country's first modern precision machine tool manufacturing factory, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, has been basically completed after a year and a half of intense construction. Preparations for the transfer to production are actively underway.
    In the factory buildings, brand-new Soviet precision machines shine brightly. Under the enthusiastic guidance of over a dozen Soviet experts, workers are manufacturing tools and fixtures, trial-producing new products, and learning to master the new machines. The workers in the tool workshop, which went into production last December, have already manufactured more than 26,000 tools and fixtures for use in their own factory's production. The various workshops of the cutting tool factory, which began operations in May of this year, have also trial-produced 35 types of high-quality cutting tools. The measuring tool factory and the central laboratory, which have recently completed the machine installation project, have hung up white window curtains, and a group of young male and female workers and technicians are learning on various precision machines. During the trial production process, the entire plant has trained 156 grinding and milling workers and is preparing to train more than 100 additional technical workers in special trades such as lettering, calibration, mechanical adjustment, and heat treatment in the near future.
    On the wall newspapers at the end of each workshop are letters from workers from many factories across the country, filled with hopeful expectations. In these letters, people are hoping that this new factory will supply them with the measuring tools and cutting tools they need as soon as possible, so that they can be used to manufacture new machines that our country could not manufacture in the past.
    The leveling and greening project around the factory buildings is also nearing completion. Gardeners are applying the advanced Soviet experience in autumn tree planting, planting saplings of elm, pagoda tree, and other trees along the roads in the factory, and sowing seeds of green grass on the already prepared ground.
    In the office building, the staff of the factory and the various departments of the capital construction department are working very hard to summarize the factory construction project, settle accounts for investments, and sort out inspection records of various engineering quality and machine installation records, compiling them as valuable data for future construction of new factories and factory maintenance.

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂积极准备移交生产
    我国第一座现代化的精密机械工具制造工厂——哈尔滨量具刃具厂，经过一年半来紧张的建设，现在已经基本完工。移交生产的准备工作正在积极进行。
    在厂房里，崭新的苏联精密机器闪耀着光采，工人们在十几个苏联专家的热情指导下，正在制造工具和卡具、试制新产品和学习掌握新机器。去年十二月投入生产的工具车间的工人们已经制造出两万六千多件供自己工厂生产用的工具和卡具。今年五月开工的刃具厂各车间，也已经试制出三十五种优等质量的刃具。新近基本上完成机器安装工程的量具厂和中央试验室已经挂起了白色的窗幔，一批年轻的男女工人和技术人员正在各种精密的机器上进行学习。全厂在试生产过程中，已经培养出一百五十六个磨工和铣工，准备在短期内再培养出一百多个刻字刻度、机械调整、热处理等特殊工种的技术工人。
    在每个车间尽头的壁报上，贴着全国各地许多工厂的职工们写来的满怀热望的信。在这些信里，人们盼望着这个新工厂早日供给他们所需要的量具和刃具，以便用来制造我国过去不能制造的新机器。
    在厂房周围的平土和绿化工程也快完工了。园林工人正运用苏联秋季植林的先进经验，在厂内道路旁边栽植榆树、黄槐等树苗，并且在已经整理好的地坪上撒播了绿草的种籽。
    在办公大楼里，工厂和基本建设部门各科室的工作人员正十分紧张地进行建厂工程总结，结算投资和整理各种工程质量的检查记录、机械安装记录，把它们汇编起来，作为将来建设新厂和进行工厂维修时用的可贵的资料。　（新华社）
