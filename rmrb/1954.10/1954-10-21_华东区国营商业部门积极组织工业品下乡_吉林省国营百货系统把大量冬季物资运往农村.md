    East China Region State-Owned Commercial Departments Actively Organize Industrial Products to Go to the Countryside
    Jilin Province State-Owned Department Store System Transports Large Quantities of Winter Supplies to Rural Areas
    The state-owned commercial departments in East China are actively organizing industrial products to be sent to the countryside, and large quantities of general merchandise are being continuously transferred to the vast rural areas.

    The East China Commercial Bureau held a symposium on industrial products going to the countryside in September, specifically to study the situation of the peak season market and the issue of industrial products going to the countryside. At the recent fourth quarter replenishment meeting held by the China National General Merchandise Company's Shanghai Central Station, the preliminary supplementary order figures submitted by various regions have reached over 300 billion yuan. Provinces and cities have also successively held temporary manager meetings and fourth quarter material supply meetings to arrange for the organization and transportation of general merchandise. Currently, various regions are continuing to transfer large quantities of goods to rural areas according to plan.

    This year, state-owned commercial departments in East China have paid attention to accepting the opinions of the masses when organizing sources of goods. The Shanghai General Merchandise Central Station's work in organizing sources of goods this year has not only started earlier than in previous years, but also improved in terms of specifications, variety, and quality based on consumer feedback. For example, the supply of cotton socks was insufficient last year, but there was still potential for production. This year, the station organized factories to produce them in advance in April and started delivering goods in advance in the second quarter. Last year, various regions reported that the napped quality of the socks was not good, but this year's napping is much purer than last year's.

    The Jilin Province state-owned department store system is actively transferring winter supplies to rural areas. State-owned general merchandise wholesale stations in Changchun, Jilin, and Siping held fourth quarter material supply meetings in September and signed material supply contracts with grassroots stores. The amount of rubber-soled cotton shoes allocated by the Changchun area wholesale station to the grassroots stores based on the supply contracts is now double the total supply for the entire year last year. The allocated woollen underwear and trousers have increased by 40 percent compared to the same period last year. The Baicheng area wholesale station allocated a large number of dog fur hats, fur coats, cotton-padded leather shoes, and *wula* (traditional winter boots) to Anguang, Taonan, and Kaitong counties in September. These goods are now successively meeting with the vast number of farmers.

    To welcome the arrival of the peak season after the autumn harvest, the state-owned Guanxian Department Store Company has transported a large number of autumn daily-use general merchandise to meet the needs of farmers after the autumn harvest. (Attached picture)

    华东区国营商业部门积极组织工业品下乡
    吉林省国营百货系统把大量冬季物资运往农村
    华东区国营商业部门积极进行组织工业品下乡的工作，大量百货商品正陆续不断地调往广大农村。
    华东商业局在九月间召开工业品下乡座谈会，专门研究了旺季市场的情况和工业品下乡问题。中国百货公司上海中央站最近召开的第四季度补货会议上，各地提出的初步补充要货数字已达三千亿元以上。各省、市也陆续召开临时经理会议和第四季度物资供应会议，对百货商品的组织、调运工作作了安排。现在，各地正按照计划向农村继续调运大批物品。
    今年华东区国营商业部门在组织货源时注意接受了群众的意见。上海百货中央站今年组织货源的工作不仅在时间上比往年提早，在规格品种质量方面也根据消费者意见作了改进。如棉毛袜去年供应不足，但生产还有潜力，今年该站就提前在四月份组织各厂生产，并于第二季度开始提前发货；去年各地反映袜子的拉毛质量不好，今年的拉毛已比去年纯得多了。
    吉林省国营百货系统积极往农村调拨冬季物资。长春、吉林、四平地区的国营百货批发站，分别在九月间召开了第四季度物资供应会议，和各基层商店普遍签订了物资供应合同。长春地区的批发站根据供应合同拨到各基层商店的棉胶鞋，现在已比去年全年的供应量多一倍；调拨下去的绒衣、绒裤，比去年同一时期增加百分之四十。白城地区的批发站在九月间就把大批狗皮帽子、皮大衣、棉皮鞋、靰鞡等冬货，拨到安广、洮南、开通等县。现在这些货物已陆续和广大农民见面。
