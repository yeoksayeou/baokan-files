Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 25th: According to TASS, democratic newspapers in Berlin are paying close attention to the Soviet government's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on October 23rd.

On October 24th, Berlin's democratic newspapers published the full text of the Soviet government's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on their front pages. "Neues Deutschland" was headlined: "Soviet Government Proposes Western Countries Hold Conference in November to Discuss German Question," "Berliner Zeitung" was headlined "Soviet Union Advocates Immediate Withdrawal of Occupation Forces," "Die Morgenpost" was headlined "Soviet Union Proposes Meeting of Foreign Ministers," and the central organ of the Christian Democratic Union, "Neue Zeit," was headlined: "North Atlantic Military Group is Aggressive. Free All-German Elections Must Be Held. London Agreements Threaten Unification. Immediate Withdrawal of Occupation Forces."

"Neues Deutschland" published a commentary on the Soviet government's note. The commentary stated: "Just as the Western countries are discussing in Paris the final division of Germany and the use of West German youth as cannon fodder for an aggressive West European military bloc, the Soviet Union has taken a new initiative to seek the unification of Germany and the maintenance of European peace." The newspaper went on to point out that the Soviet government's new note is based on the fact that the restoration of German unity and the establishment of Germany as a peaceful and democratic state is a crucial issue not only for the German people but also for the entire people of Europe. Therefore, the Soviet government in its new note proposes that a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union be held in November this year to discuss the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis, the holding of free all-German elections, the withdrawal of the four countries' occupation forces from East and West German territory, and the convening of an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system.
    
Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: According to TASS Paris: The French "L'Humanité Dimanche" commented on the signing of the agreement by Western countries' representatives on arming West Germany within the framework of the so-called Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the 24th, saying: "If the treaty signed in Paris on the 23rd is ratified, then France will again be fatally threatened."

The newspaper pointed out that the Paris agreement realizes Adenauer's plan to rebuild the "Bundeswehr" and will help realize Adenauer's territorial demands and instigate new wars and said: Increased military expansion will be the inevitable consequence of the implementation of the Paris agreement, and this will be a heavy burden on the shoulders of the French working people.

The newspaper wrote: "But the Soviet note of October 23rd reminds our country that there is another path. The Soviet Union insists on being faithful to its unchanging peaceful policy, and it once again suggests replacing the policy of 'strength' with a policy of consultation, and replacing the establishment of (exclusive) blocs with the organization of a collective security system. It proposes the peaceful unification of Germany and rejects the aggressive plans of the West German revanchists under the protection of the governments in Washington, London and Paris."

The newspaper also wrote: "Mendès-France is willing to sign the document reviving the new German Bundeswehr. But this signature is no more effective than the signatures of his predecessors Bidault and Robert Schuman."

    德法两国民主报纸重视苏联照会
    【新华社柏林二十五日电】据塔斯社讯：柏林各民主报纸十分重视十月二十三日苏联政府致法、英、美三国政府的照会。
    十月二十四日，柏林各民主报纸在头几页刊载了苏联政府致法、英、美三国政府的照会的全文。“新德意志报”的标题是：“苏联政府建议西方国家在十一月召开讨论德国问题的会议”，“柏林日报”的标题是“苏联主张立即撤退占领军”，“晨报”的标题是“苏联建议召开外长会议”，基督教民主联盟中央机关报“新时报”的标题是：“北大西洋军事集团是侵略性的。必须举行全德自由选举。伦敦协议威胁着统一。立即撤退占领军。”
    “新德意志报”就苏联政府照会发表评论。评论写道：“正当西方国家在巴黎商量最后分裂德国、要利用西德的青年来充当侵略性的西欧军事集团的炮灰的时候，苏联采取了新的主动，以求统一德国和维护欧洲和平。”这一家报纸接着指出，苏联政府的新照会是根据下列事实出发的，即恢复德国统一，使德国成为一个和平民主的国家，不仅对德国人民、就是对欧洲全体人民来说都是一个紧要的问题，因此苏联政府在新照会中建议在今年十一月召开法、英、美、苏四国外长会议，以便讨论在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一和举行全德自由选举、四国占领军撤出东西德领土以及召开全欧会议以便讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系等问题。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国“人道报星期日刊”在二十四日评论西方国家代表签订关于在所谓西欧联盟和北大西洋公约组织范围内武装西德的协议说：“如果二十三日在巴黎签订的条约被批准，那么法国又将受到致命的威胁。”
    这家报纸在指出巴黎协定实现了阿登纳的重建“国防军”计划并且将帮助实现阿登纳的领土要求和策动新战争的野心之后说：加紧扩军将是实现巴黎协定的不可避免的后果，这将是加在法国劳动人民肩上的一个重担。
    这家报纸写道：“但是，苏联十月二十三日的照会提醒了我国，还有另外一条道路存在。苏联坚持忠实于自己的不变的和平政策，它又一次建议以协商的政策来代替‘实力’政策，以组织集体安全体系来代替建立（排他性）集团。它建议和平统一德国，拒绝在华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎政府庇护下的西德复仇主义者的侵略计划。”
    这一家报纸又写道：“孟戴斯—弗朗斯甘愿在复活新的德国国防军的文件上签字。但是这种签字并不比他的前任皮杜尔和罗伯·舒曼的签字更有效。”
