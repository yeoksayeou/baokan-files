    According to the State Council of the Central People's Government's 224th session on September 9, 1954, "Decision on the Establishment of the People's Construction Bank of China," the head office of the People's Construction Bank of China and its branches and offices in various locations were officially established on October 1st. From now on, the state will have a specialized agency to handle the allocation and supervision of basic construction funds, which will play a significant role in strengthening financial supervision of basic construction and ensuring the timely supply of basic construction funds. From the date of its establishment, the People's Construction Bank of China began to take over the allocation and supervision of basic construction funds and decided that all relevant regulations and decrees concerning the allocation and supervision of basic construction funds previously issued by the Bank of Communications would continue to be valid; the allocation accounts, settlement accounts, and advance payment accounts, etc., originally opened by construction units and construction enterprises at the Bank of Communications, would also be transferred to the People's Construction Bank of China for continued handling.
    The head office of the People's Construction Bank of China held an inaugural meeting ahead of schedule on September 29th. In their speeches at the meeting, the heads of the head office pointed out that to do a good job in the allocation and supervision of basic construction funds, all cadres must unite and cooperate, help each other, overcome complacency, deeply understand the situation, systematically study advanced Soviet experience, closely rely on the leadership of local Party and government under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Finance, strengthen ties with various departments, and strive to give full play to work enthusiasm and creativity. Only in this way can we accomplish this new and arduous task. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国人民建设银行已在十月一日成立
    根据中央人民政府政务院一九五四年九月九日第二百二十四次政务会议“关于设立中国人民建设银行的决定”，中国人民建设银行总行和各地分支行处已在十月一日正式成立。以后，国家就有了一个办理基本建设拨款监督工作的专责机构，这对于加强对基本建设的财政监督，保证基本建设资金的及时供应，将起很大的作用。中国人民建设银行从成立之日起，就开始接办基本建设的拨款监督工作，并决定所有以前由交通银行颁发的各项有关基本建设拨款监督的章则法令，一律继续有效；各建设单位和建筑企业原来在交通银行开立的拨款户、结算户、预收款户等，也都移交给中国人民建设银行继续办理。
    中国人民建设银行总行提前在九月二十九日举行了成立大会。总行首长在会上的讲话中指出：要做好基本建设的拨款监督工作，全体干部必须团结合作，互相帮助，克服骄傲自满情绪，深入了解情况，系统学习苏联先进经验，在财政部的直接领导下，密切依靠各地党政领导，加强和各部门的联系，努力发挥工作积极性和创造性。只有这样，才能完成这个新的艰巨的任务。（新华社）
