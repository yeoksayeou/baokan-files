Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: More than 70,000 new agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established in eight provinces including Hebei, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Rehe, Zhejiang, and Guizhou.

	In Hebei Province, a situation of large-scale development of the agricultural cooperation movement has taken shape. According to incomplete statistics from the entire province as of now: the household numbers in more than 31,000 old cooperatives have expanded by about double; 18,123 new cooperatives have been established; more than 11,500 are undergoing "Four Appraisals" and other work. In addition, more than 11,000 cooperatives are already "framed up," and more than 11,500 cooperatives are being planned for organization. This development situation is close to Hebei Province's planned development target for this year. The significant increase in production in the original 30,000+ old cooperatives in Hebei has been an important factor in the rapid development of the cooperative movement. These 30,000+ old cooperatives are distributed in 70% of the townships. They not only attract and inspire the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to join the cooperatives with their superior production but also many cadres of old cooperatives personally help local mutual aid teams and individual farmers to organize agricultural producers' cooperatives, providing extremely favorable conditions for the large-scale development of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province this year.

	Shanxi Province has initially established 2,504 agricultural producers' cooperatives, and 10,514 cooperatives are ready to be established, with a total of 446,680 participating farm households. At the same time, the original agricultural producers' cooperatives have also expanded their membership by 200,145 households. At present, most of the newly established cooperatives in various regions have established production organizations and have begun to engage in autumn wheat planting and autumn plowing production in an orderly manner.

	Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, and Rehe provinces established more than 40,000 new agricultural producers' cooperatives after summer weeding this year. Now, the four provinces have nearly 60,000 new and existing agricultural producers' cooperatives, with the number of farm households participating in the cooperatives accounting for 21% to 27% of the total number of farm households in each province. 85% to 90% of the more than 40,000 new cooperatives established in various provinces have good conditions for mutual aid and cooperation and leadership backbone. Since the spring, the more than 80,000 mutual aid teams that have successively registered to prepare for the establishment of cooperatives have performed better than the average local farmers in all seasons of production. The vast majority of the cooperatives that have been established have closely integrated production during the establishment process, preventing the phenomenon of delaying production due to the establishment of cooperatives. At present, the newly established cooperatives are fully engaged in the autumn harvest. The four provinces are expected to develop more than 40,000 new cooperatives after the autumn harvest.

	As of the end of September, Zhejiang Province has increased the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives from more than 2,200 in the first half of the year to more than 9,300. More than 150,000 farm households have recently become members of the cooperatives, and the total number of members has increased more than four times compared with the first half of the year. 140 townships in the province have basically been cooperativized. The agricultural producers' cooperatives established in various regions were voluntarily established by the broad masses of farmers after seeing the superiority of the collective management of the local old cooperatives. The local CCP committees have planned to develop about 10,000 more agricultural producers' cooperatives in nearly 2,000 townships with a better working foundation before the autumn harvest, and actively train cadres, cultivate and understand the objects of cooperative establishment, and welcome the upsurge of cooperative establishment in most townships after the autumn harvest.

	Farmers of all ethnic groups on the Guizhou Plateau have combined summer and autumn production and established 3,067 new agricultural producers' cooperatives. Many of them are jointly formed by ethnic minorities or farmers of various ethnic groups. In the four Miao autonomous counties of Taijiang, Danzhai, Leishan, and Lushan alone, 64 Miao agricultural producers' cooperatives have been newly established. This is the first batch of agricultural producers' cooperatives established in Guizhou Province after a key pilot project this spring. Various localities have successively trained more than 56,000 district and township cadres and peasant activists since the summer, cultivated backbones for cooperative establishment, and deeply carried out propaganda and education to the peasants to help them realize the necessity and benefits of organizing agricultural producers' cooperatives. In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities or mixed communities, the cooperative establishment work has paid special attention to relying on ethnic minority cadres, uniting ethnic upper-class figures, and respecting the customs and habits of various ethnic groups, so that ethnic minority farmers can quickly eliminate their concerns and voluntarily request to participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives. At present, these newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives are intensively engaged in autumn plowing and autumn planting work.

    河北、山西、黑龙江、浙江等八省新建七万多个农业合作社
    据新华社讯：河北、山西、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、热河、浙江、贵州等八省，新建农业生产合作社七万多个。
    河北省农业合作化运动的大发展形势已经形成。截至目前，据全省不完整的统计：三万一千多个老社扩大户数一倍左右；新建成的社达一万八千一百二十三个；正在进行“四评”等工作的有一万一千五百多个。另外，还有一万一千多个社已经“搭好架子”，一万一千五百多个社正在酝酿组织。这种发展情况，已接近今年河北省预订的发展计划。河北原有的三万多个老社的显著增产，是合作化运动迅速发展的重要因素。三万多个老社分布在百分之七十的乡里，它们不仅以自己生产上的优越性吸引和鼓舞了广大农民的入社热情，而且很多老社的干部还亲手帮助当地互助组和单干农民组织农业生产合作社，对于今年全省农业生产合作社的大发展，提供了极为有利的条件。
    山西省目前已初步建成农业生产合作社二千五百零四个，酝酿成熟的社有一万零五百一十四个，参加农户共有四十四万六千六百八十户。同时原有农业生产合作社也扩展社员二十万零一千四百一十五户。现在各地大部新建社已建立了生产组织，并开始有秩序地投入秋季种麦、秋耕生产。
    黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、热河四省今年夏锄后建成四万多个新的农业生产合作社。现在，四个省新建加原有的农业生产合作社已接近六万个，入社农户占各省农户总数的百分之二十一到二十七。各省已建成的四万多个新社，百分之八十五到九十的互助合作基础、领导骨干等条件都较好。从春季开始，陆续报名准备建社的八万多个互助组，各季生产都比当地一般农民好，已建成社的绝大多数在建社过程中密切地结合了生产，防止了建社耽误生产的现象。目前，新建社都全力投入秋收。四省预计秋后共再发展四万多个新社。
    浙江省到九月底为止，全省农业生产合作社已由上半年的两千两百多个增加到九千三百多个。共有十五万多户农民新近成为社员，社员总数比上半年增加了四倍多。全省已有一百四十个乡基本上合作化。各地建立的农业生产合作社，都是广大农民看到了当地老社集体经营的优越性后自愿建立起来的。各地中共党委已计划在工作基础较好的近两千个乡中，在秋收前再发展一万个左右农业生产合作社，并积极训练干部、培养和了解办社对象，迎接秋收后大多数乡的建社热潮。
    贵州高原上各族农民结合夏季秋季生产，新建了三千零六十七个农业生产合作社。其中有许多是由少数民族或各族农民共同组成的，仅台江、丹寨、雷山、炉山等四个县级苗族自治区，就新建了六十四个苗族农业生产合作社。这是贵州省在今春重点试办后第一批建立的农业生产合作社。各地从夏季就开始陆续训练了五万六千多个区乡干部及农民积极分子，培养建社骨干，深入地向农民进行宣传教育，帮助他们认识到组织农业生产合作社的必要和好处。在少数民族聚居和杂居地区，建社工作特别注意了依靠民族干部、团结民族上层人物和尊重各民族的风俗习惯，使少数民族农民很快解除顾虑，自愿地要求参加农业生产合作社。现在，这些新建的农业生产合作社，正紧张地进行秋耕秋种工作。
