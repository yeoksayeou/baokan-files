Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 18th: Our correspondent reports on the situation in Cambodia after the ceasefire: A simultaneous ceasefire has been achieved throughout Cambodia for more than two months. During this period, the delegations of the warring parties in Cambodia have reached agreements on some issues and have begun to implement them. The personnel of the Khmer Resistance Forces have completed their demobilization on August 21st. The General Headquarters of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Headquarters of the Vietnamese Volunteer Forces have handed over all prisoners of war to the Royal Cambodian Army. According to the agreement, the Vietnamese Volunteer Forces and the French Union Forces will completely withdraw from Cambodia before October 20th this year.

Although certain achievements have been made in implementing the terms of the ceasefire agreement, the resolution of issues in the Joint Ceasefire Commission has been slow and increasingly difficult due to the Cambodian Royal Government's failure to fully and faithfully abide by the Geneva Conference agreements and its hostile attitude towards the Khmer Resistance Government and Resistance Forces.

The Cambodian Royal Government issued a notice in the "Cambodia Daily" on September 15th, stating that the Geneva Conference only recognized the Cambodian Royal Delegation and the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and that the Cambodian Royal Government did not recognize any group calling itself the Khmer Resistance Forces. On September 16th, the Cambodian Royal Government's Minister of Information publicly announced that the following three types of people: Khmer resisters, anti-monarchists, and communists, would be prohibited from participating in the upcoming general election.

The delegations of the General Headquarters of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Headquarters of the Vietnamese Volunteer Forces lodged a protest with the Joint Ceasefire Commission regarding the Cambodian Royal Government's notice, arguing that it was an attempt by the Cambodian Royal Government to deny the legitimate existence of the Resistance Forces, thereby excluding patriotic Cambodian people who participated in the resistance from the common life of the country and depriving them of their civil rights in the future general election.

The International Supervisory and Control Commission in Cambodia also discussed the matter, believing that the Cambodian Royal Government's notice misinterpreted the ceasefire agreement and demanding that the Cambodian Royal Government clarify the incident.

However, the Cambodian Royal Government reaffirmed its previous position in a notice issued on September 24th. Cambodian King Sihanouk also delivered speeches in Porommen and Chai Zhen on September 29th and 30th, calling on the Khmer Resistance Forces personnel who had already been demobilized to reassemble and "surrender" to the Royal Government. Prior to this, the Cambodian Royal representatives had used the excuse that the Khmer Resistance Forces had not been demobilized "in front" of them to put forward the above-mentioned unreasonable demands in violation of the ceasefire agreement.

The Cambodian Royal Government has also begun to take retaliatory actions against the demobilized Khmer Resistance Forces personnel. According to reliable sources, the Cambodian Royal Government has secretly ordered the governors of ten provinces to "eliminate the Resistance Viet Minh" (i.e., persecute the demobilized Khmer Resistance Forces personnel). The Cambodian Royal Army representatives in the Cambodian Joint Ceasefire Commission also notified the delegations of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Vietnamese Volunteer Forces that they would submit Cambodian people who participated in the resistance during the war for trial in court for so-called "violations of the Kingdom's laws." At the same time, incidents of arresting demobilized Resistance Forces personnel and persecuting the families of Resistance fighters have occurred in Battambang, Kompong Cham and other places.

The delegations of the General Headquarters of the Khmer Resistance Forces and the Headquarters of the Vietnamese Volunteer Forces have lodged protests with the Cambodian Royal Army delegation in the Joint Ceasefire Commission regarding the above-mentioned issues. They also demanded that the Cambodian Royal Government cease hostile actions against the Resistance Forces, guarantee the freedom and democratic rights of the people, so that all Resistance personnel can participate in the common life of the country and participate in the general election.

In a letter to the Cambodian Royal Government on September 29th, the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Cambodia stated that the Khmer Resistance Forces had completed their demobilization, in accordance with the provisions of the ceasefire agreement. The letter also pointed out that the Cambodian Royal Government has not yet taken the necessary measures to implement the provisions of Article 6 of the ceasefire agreement, so that the Khmer Resistance Forces personnel can participate in the common life of the country without discrimination, enjoy the rights and freedoms stipulated by the Kingdom's Constitution, participate in the general election, and not be retaliated against them and their families.

Obviously, the series of measures taken by the Cambodian Royal Government to exclude Resistance personnel are being carried out under the direction of French warmongers and American imperialism. These measures violate both the ceasefire agreement and the national interests of Cambodia.

### 高棉抗战部队遵守停战协定全部复员完毕

    高棉抗战部队遵守停战协定全部复员完毕
    柬埔寨王国政府公然排挤和迫害抗战人员
      【新华社北越十八日电】本社记者报道柬埔寨停战后的情况说：柬埔寨全境同时实现停火已经两个多月。这期间，柬埔寨交战双方代表团在一些问题上获得了协议并已开始履行。高棉抗战部队人员已在八月二十一日全部复员完毕。高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部已经把战俘全部移交给柬埔寨王国军队。根据协议，越南志愿人员和法兰西联邦部队将在今年十月二十日前全部撤出柬埔寨。
    虽然在履行停战协定的条款中获得了一定成就，但是由于柬埔寨王国政府不能完全忠实地遵守日内瓦会议的协定，对高棉抗战政府和抗战部队采取了敌视的态度，所以在联合停战委员会上解决问题很慢而且困难越来越多。
    柬埔寨王国政府在九月十五日的“柬埔寨日报”上发出通告说，日内瓦会议只承认柬埔寨王国代表团和越南民主共和国代表团，柬埔寨王国不承认任何自称为高棉抗战部队的集团。九月十六日，柬埔寨王国政府宣传大臣又公开宣布，以下三种人：高棉抗战者、反君主制度者和共产主义者，将被禁止参加即将到来的普选。
    高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部代表团在联合停战委员会上就柬埔寨王国政府的通告提出了抗议，认为这是柬埔寨王国政府企图否认抗战部队的合法存在，借此把爱国的参加抗战的柬埔寨人民排斥在国家的共同生活之外，并在将来的普选中剥夺他们的公民权利。
    柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会也就此事进行了讨论，认为柬埔寨王国政府的通告曲解停战协定，并要求柬埔寨王国政府对这一事件加以澄清。
    但是柬埔寨王国政府在九月二十四日发表的通告中，重申了以前的立场。柬埔寨国王西哈努克并于九月二十九日和三十日在波萝勉和柴桢两地发表演说，要已经全部复员了的高棉抗战部队人员重新集合起来向王国政府“投降”。在此以前，柬埔寨王国代表曾借口高棉抗战部队没有在他们“面前”复员，而提出上述违反停战协定的无理要求。
    柬埔寨王国政府并已开始对复员的高棉抗战部队人员采取报复行动。据可靠的消息说，柬埔寨王国政府已密令十省省长“消灭抗战越盟”（即迫害已复员了的高棉抗战部队人员）。柬埔寨联合停战委员会中的柬埔寨王国军队代表还通知高棉抗战部队和越南志愿人员的代表团，说他们要把在战争期间所谓“违反王国法律”的抗战的柬埔寨人提交法院审判。同时，在马德望、磅湛等地已发生了逮捕抗战部队复员人员和迫害抗战战士家属的事件。
    高棉抗战部队总司令部和越南志愿人员司令部代表团已就以上各项问题，在联合停战委员会上向柬埔寨王国军队代表团提出抗议。他们并要求柬埔寨王国政府停止对抗战部队的敌对行动，保障人民的自由和民主权利，使全体抗战人员都能参加国家的共同生活和参加普选。
    柬埔寨国际监督和监察委员会在九月二十九日给柬埔寨王国政府的复信中，认为高棉抗战部队已经复员完毕，符合于停战协定的规定。信件并指出，柬埔寨王国政府直到现在为止，还没有采取必要措施来实现停战协定第六条的规定，使高棉抗战部队人员不受歧视地参加国家的共同生活，享有王国宪法规定的权利和自由，参加普选，并不得对他们和他们的家属进行报复。
    显然地，柬埔寨王国政府目前采取的一系列排挤抗战人员的措施是在法国好战分子和美帝国主义指使下进行的。这些措施既违反停战协定，也违反柬埔寨的民族利益。
