    On the Zhejiang front lines, the People's Liberation Army frequently engages in intense battles with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops. American-made Chiang planes, taking off from Taiwan, constantly take advantage of various opportunities to launch sneak attacks on our coastal areas. The Chiang bandits' warships lurk near the islands occupied by the Chiang bandit troops every day, waiting for opportunities to engage in piracy. The Chiang bandit troops entrenched on islands such as Dachen also frequently conduct combat exercises at dawn or dusk, threatening the security of the coastal areas. The land, sea, and air forces of the People's Liberation Army are waging unremitting struggles on this turbulent coastline to defend the motherland's coastal defenses. The warships of the People's Navy patrol the ocean day and night, monitoring the activities of enemy ships. At night, the searchlights on the warships illuminate the dark sea, searching for the Chiang bandit troops who dare to cross the sea to invade. Radar soldiers observe the traces of Chiang bandit aircraft on the radar screens day and night. Air Force squadrons, called "sea swallows" by the sailors, patrol the skies over the motherland's coast day and night, searching for Chiang bandit planes that come to carry out sneak attacks. The mouths of the coastal artillery pieces installed on the coast and islands point to the vast ocean, ready to strike Chiang bandit warships at any time. The infantry soldiers who have experienced the difficult years of the Liberation War proudly say, we are getting stronger and stronger, and now from the land, the sea, to the sky, we have our comrades-in-arms jointly defending the great motherland!
    The Zhejiang sea is an important sea route for our country's maritime traffic, and the Zhoushan Islands are a famous fishing ground in the country. The brave men of the various branches of the People's Liberation Army have established countless merits in protecting navigation routes and protecting fishermen's production.
    This spring, four merchant ships fully loaded with supplies were sailing from a certain place to Haimen when they were suddenly attacked by two Chiang bandit warships, and one merchant ship was hit and wounded. The naval command immediately dispatched four gunboats to rescue the merchant ships. When the gunboats arrived at the scene, the two Chiang bandit warships had already seized a favorable position and used broadside artillery fire to bombard our gunboats. At this time, our gunboats chased after them in two groups. The helmsmen cleverly turned the rudders, allowing the advancing gunboats to skillfully dodge the shells from the Chiang bandit warships. The four gunboats quickly formed a semi-circular encirclement and fiercely bombarded the Chiang bandit warships together. The Chiang bandit warships fired a few shots in a panic and fled in a mess. At night, the gunboats patrolled near a merchant ship that had been damaged by the Chiang bandit warships, protecting the workers on board as they rushed to repair the machinery. Before dawn the next day, our gunboats sailed to the back of a small island and hid, preparing to fiercely attack the Chiang bandit warships that came to invade again.
    As soon as it was light, the two Chiang bandit warships sailed towards the merchant ships again. When they broke into the fire net pre-set by our gunboats, the artillery fire on the gunboats suddenly roared, and dense shells hit the Chiang bandit warships. One Chiang bandit warship frantically fired artillery fire, covering another Chiang bandit warship as it circled behind our gunboats, attempting to attack from both the front and rear. But just as this warship had set up its formation and prepared to bombard, our coastal artillery roared, and the gunboats also concentrated their firepower and bombarded together. Shells exploded non-stop near the Chiang bandit warships and on the decks of the warships, which were hit and black smoke rose. At this time, another Chiang bandit warship hurriedly released a burst of smoke, covering the wounded warship as it fled. At this time, the damaged merchant ship had repaired its machinery, and the heroic gunboats escorted the merchant ship safely to its destination.
    During the fishing season, wherever the fishing boats sailed, the sailors of the People's Liberation Army went there to protect fishing. In April this year, when the fishermen along the Zhejiang coast set sail to fish, the People's Navy warships also came to patrol the sea near the fishing grounds day and night. One morning, two Chiang bandit warships secretly sailed to the outside of the fishing grounds,妄想wanting to rob fishing boats. Our navy immediately launched a fierce naval battle with the Chiang bandit warships. Gunboat 520 cleverly sailed next to the Chiang bandit warship, and the gunners used dense shells to bombard the command tower on the warship. The Chiang bandit warship also concentrated all its artillery fire to bombard gunboat 520, and shells exploded near the gunboat. Gunner Tang Mingbao was wounded in the head, but continued to fire non-stop. Signalman Wang Xishun was wounded in his right hand, so he waved the contact flag with his left hand. The shells fired by gunboat 520 and other gunboats concentratedly caused the Chiang bandit warship to smoke and catch fire in three places. Observers clearly saw in their telescopes that the bandit soldiers on this warship were running around and bumping into each other on the deck, and many people were shot down. This warship fled in a southeast direction with thick smoke and flames. Another Chiang bandit warship also fled in a panic. When the gunboat returned to the vicinity of the fishing grounds after winning the victory, the fishermen who were fishing waved the large fish they had caught to the sailors, expressing their gratitude to the People's Navy.
    The heroic coastal artillerymen also laid a tight fire net on the vast ocean, constantly打击attacking the Chiang bandit troops. Once, two Chiang bandit warships attempted to intercept our two merchant ships on the sea surface in a certain place. The artillerymen guarding a certain island immediately fired a volley of shells fiercely, damaging a Chiang bandit warship. Another day, when two small fishing boats were fishing near Toumenshan Island, the Chiang bandit artillery entrenched on Yijiangshan Island bombarded the fishing boats, and the Chiang bandit warships then rushed to carry out artillery bombardment. Our artillerymen guarding Toumenshan Island opened fire, and the gunners operated the artillery with their bare backs in the cold sea breeze, firing fiercely. As a result of the battle: the Chiang bandit warships were successfully repelled, and the Chiang bandit artillery on Yijiangshan Island was silenced.
    In the People's Liberation Army units on the Zhejiang coastal defense front, the battle cry of resolutely liberating Taiwan is boiling everywhere. On the coastal defense positions on Toumenshan Island, the soldiers drew a map of Taiwan on the wall. The map was marked with Taiwan's rich products, and next to the map was a line of large characters: "We must liberate the motherland's territory - Taiwan!" At a coastal artillery position, the reporter interviewed the young artillery commander Wu Defang, who is from Liaozhong County, Liaoning Province. This summer, he had asked for leave to go home. When he returned to his hometown, which had been separated for more than six years, he saw that his hometown was a scene of prosperity: the villagers who used to live in thatched sheds had built brand-new tile houses, and everyone in every household was wearing new clothes. Almost all the people in their village had joined agricultural production cooperatives, and their lives were getting better day by day. On the way home, he also saw that the chimneys of the factories in Shenyang were more numerous than before, and many cities along the way had added tall buildings. All the scenes of the motherland advancing towards socialism have further increased his determination and confidence in liberating Taiwan. He said: "We have a strong motherland, and we will definitely be able to liberate Taiwan!"

    战斗在浙东海防线上
    新华社记者　路云
    在浙东前线，人民解放军时常和蒋贼军进行紧张的战斗。从台湾起飞的美制蒋机，不时利用各种时机偷袭我沿海地区。蒋贼的舰艇，每天都躲在蒋贼军盘踞的岛屿附近伺隙进行海盗活动。盘踞在大陈等岛屿上的蒋贼军，还经常在拂晓或黄昏进行战斗演习，威胁着沿海地区的安全。人民解放军陆、海、空军部队就在这不平静的海岸线上，为保卫祖国海防而进行着不懈的斗争。人民海军的舰艇，日夜巡逻在海洋上监视着敌舰的活动；夜里，军舰上的探照灯照射着漆黑的海面，搜索着胆敢渡海来犯的蒋贼军。雷达兵们日夜不停地在雷达萤光板上观察着蒋贼飞机的踪迹。被水兵们称为“海燕”的空军机群，日夜地巡逻在祖国沿海的上空，寻找前来偷袭的蒋贼飞机。安设在海岸和岛屿上的海岸大炮的炮口，指向辽阔的海洋，准备随时打击蒋贼军舰。经历过解放战争的那些艰难岁月的步兵战士们，都自豪地说，我们越来越强大了，现在从陆地、海洋直到天空，都有我们的战友在共同保卫着伟大的祖国！
    浙东海面是我国海上的交通要道，舟山群岛是全国著名的渔场。解放军各兵种部队的勇士们，在保护航道和保护渔民生产的任务中曾建立了无数功绩。
    今年春天，四艘满载物资的商轮由某地开往海门时，突然遭到两艘蒋贼军舰的袭击，有一艘商船中弹负伤。我海军某指挥部当时立刻派出四艘炮艇去救援商船。当炮艇驶到出事地点时，那两艘蒋贼军舰已抢占了一个有利的位置，利用侧射炮火轰击我军的炮艇。这时我军的炮艇分两路追赶过去。舵手们机智地转动着舵盘，使前进的炮艇巧妙地躲开蒋贼军舰的炮弹。四艘炮艇迅速地形成了一个半圆形的包围圈，一齐向蒋贼军舰猛烈轰击。蒋贼军舰慌乱地放了几炮，便狼狈地逃走了。夜里，炮艇在被蒋贼军舰击伤的一艘商船附近巡逻着，保护船上的工人抢修机器。第二天黎明前，我军的炮艇又驶到某小岛的背面隐蔽起来，准备着痛击再来进犯的蒋贼军舰。
    天刚亮，蒋贼的两艘军舰又朝着商船开来。当它们一闯进我军炮艇预设的火网时，炮艇上的炮火突然轰鸣起来，密集的炮弹打向蒋贼军舰。有一艘蒋贼军舰疯狂地发射着炮火，掩护另外一艘蒋贼军舰绕到我军炮艇的后面，企图前后夹击。但当这艘军舰刚摆好阵势准备轰击时，我们的海岸大炮怒吼了，炮艇也集中火力一齐轰击，炮弹不停地在蒋贼军舰附近和军舰甲板上爆炸着，被打得升起了黑烟。这时另一艘蒋贼军舰慌忙放出了一阵烟幕，掩护着受伤的军舰逃走了。这时被击伤的商船已修好了机器，英雄的炮艇就掩护着商船安全地驶到了目的地。
    在渔汛期间，渔船驶到那里，人民解放军的水兵们就到那里去保护捕鱼。今年四月，当浙东沿海的渔民张帆下海捕鱼时，人民海军的舰艇也日夜来到渔场附近的海面巡逻着。一天早晨，有两艘蒋贼军舰偷偷地开到渔场外边，妄想抢劫渔船。我们的海军立即和蒋贼军舰展开了激烈的海战。五二零号炮艇机智地驶到蒋贼军舰旁边，炮手们用密集的炮弹轰击舰上的指挥塔。蒋贼军舰也集中了所有的炮火向五二零号炮艇轰击起来，炮弹在炮艇附近爆炸着。炮手唐明宝头部负了伤，仍然不停地射击着。信号员王希舜右手负了伤，就用左手挥舞着联络旗。五二零号炮艇和其他炮艇集中发射的炮弹，把那艘蒋贼军舰打得三处冒烟起火。观察员们在望远镜中清楚地看到，这艘军舰的贼兵们在甲板上乱奔乱撞，有许多人被打的倒了下去。这艘军舰带着浓烟和烈火，往东南方向逃走了。另外一艘蒋贼军舰也跟着慌张地逃走了。当炮艇获得胜利后回到渔场附近时，正在捕鱼的渔民们向水手们挥舞着捕获的大鱼，表示他们对人民海军的感激。
    英雄的海防炮兵们也在辽阔的海洋上布下了严密的火网，不断地打击着蒋贼军。有一次，两艘蒋贼军舰在某地海面上企图截击我们的两艘商船。守卫在某岛上的炮兵们立即狠狠地发射了一阵炮弹，击伤了一艘蒋贼军舰。另一天，有两只小渔船在头门山岛附近捕鱼时，盘踞在一江山岛上的蒋贼炮兵便向渔船轰击起来，蒋贼军舰也接着赶来进行炮击。守卫在头门山岛上的我军炮兵开火了，炮手们在寒冷的海风中光着膀子操作着大炮，猛烈地射击着。战斗结果：胜利地击退了蒋贼军舰，并打得一江山岛上的蒋贼大炮变成了哑巴。
    在浙东海防前线的人民解放军部队里，到处都沸腾着坚决解放台湾的战斗口号。在头门山岛的海防阵地上，战士们在墙壁上画了一幅台湾地图，地图上标注着台湾丰富的物产，地图旁边写着一行大字：“我们一定要解放祖国的领土——台湾！”在一个海岸炮兵阵地上，记者访问了年青的炮长吴德芳，他是辽宁省辽中县人。今年夏天，他曾请假回家。当他回到分离六年多的故乡时，看到家乡是一片富裕的景象：从前住在草棚里的乡亲们已盖起了崭新的瓦房，家家户户的人都穿上了新衣服。他们村子里的人，几乎全部参加了农业生产合作社，生活一天比一天好起来。在回家途中，他又看到沈阳工厂的烟筒，比从前更多了，沿途许多城市都增加了高大的楼房。祖国正在向社会主义前进的一切景象，更增加了他解放台湾的决心和信心。他说：“我们有强大的祖国，我们一定能够解放台湾！”
