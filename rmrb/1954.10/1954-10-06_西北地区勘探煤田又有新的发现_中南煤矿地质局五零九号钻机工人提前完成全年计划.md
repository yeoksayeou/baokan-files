    In the past six months, new discoveries have continued to be made in coalfield geological exploration in the Northwest region. After a general survey and verification of existing data, it was discovered that the coal-bearing strata in a coalfield in Gansu Province have outcrops everywhere. At present, the exploration team in this coalfield is conducting geological mapping to continue to determine the number of minable coal seams, total thickness, and other conditions. Exploration by Team 622 near Helan Mountain has proven that there are large coal reserves, with an average coal seam thickness of 5.5 meters. The geological structure is not very complicated, the coal quality is very good, it has coking properties, and it has great economic value. Team 625 in Gansu Province has also basically mastered the stratigraphic structure of the new and old areas in its exploration area, and has proven that there are rich reserves in the new and old areas. The exploration work in the Tongchuan and Aganzhen mining areas in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, respectively, had completed 67 percent of the annual drilling plan by the end of August. Geological detailed surveys and topographic surveys have been largely completed. In addition, a general survey team from the Northwest Geological Department also newly discovered a relatively good coalfield in Heyang, Shaanxi Province, which has prepared conditions for expanding exploration of the Weibei coalfield.
    The achievements in coalfield geological exploration in the Northwest region are inseparable from the hard work and arduous struggle of thousands of coalfield exploration personnel. The Shandanzuantan (Shandan Drilling) Team, by implementing the shift handover system and the technical responsibility system, has overfulfilled the state plan for four consecutive months, and the average coal core recovery rate has reached 79 percent. In the Qinling Mountains in the Liandang and Fengxian area on the border between Gansu Province and Shaanxi Province, the footprints of geological personnel can be seen everywhere. One of the general survey teams completed its general survey mission half a month ahead of schedule.
    The workers of No. 509 Drilling Team of the First Geological Exploration Team of the Central South Coal Mine Geological Bureau have completed this year's annual drilling plan, exceeding it by 84 meters in August, four months ahead of schedule. The highest coal core recovery rate reached 100 percent, and the average reached 98.4 percent, exceeding the state plan by 140.57 percent; the average core recovery rate reached 81.15 percent, exceeding the state plan by 108.20 percent. And basically eliminated work-related accidents. The workers of this drilling rig have recently formulated an advanced production increase and economy plan to drill another 800 meters from September to December and save 64 million yuan.
    Last year, the No. 509 Drilling Team was a model for the First Geological Exploration Team of the Central South Coal Mine Geological Bureau. This year, the tasks they accepted for several boreholes had great changes in strata, and some also had a large amount of water leakage. Therefore, whenever they accepted a borehole task, they first analyzed and studied the geological conditions of the borehole based on the ideal columnar section of the borehole to avoid accidents. They also concretely implemented the production increase plan into the work plan, and strictly checked the completion of the plan every day and every shift. They attached great importance to every minute and second of time, and improved production efficiency and increased pure drilling time with a spirit of continuous innovation. Even the few minutes it takes to change a core barrel had to be used. In order to increase pure drilling time and improve drilling efficiency, they created and improved 13 kinds of tools in the eight months of this year. And also promoted many advanced experiences. In the eight months of this year, their pure drilling time increased by an average of 4.62 percent compared with 1953; and drilling efficiency increased by 46.9 percent. In addition, they also cultivated and improved the technical level of workers through continuous technical innovation and the signing of master-apprentice contracts.

    The shaft construction of the Third Mine of Tongchuan Coal Mine Completed
    The shaft of the Third Mine of the state-owned Tongchuan Coal Mine has been completed two days ahead of schedule after more than three months of construction. The installed machinery has been operating well, with good quality, and officially raised coal on September 15.
    The average thickness of the coal seam in the Third Mine of Tongchuan Coal Mine is 4 to 5 meters, and it produces some coking coal. If calculated at an annual output of 150,000 tons, it can be continuously mined for more than 100 years. However, before liberation, the hoisting, transportation and other equipment of this mine were very simple, so accidents such as rockfalls and spalling often occurred. This construction is to expand the original shaft, which was less than two meters in diameter, to four meters, which can greatly improve the hoisting efficiency.

    西北地区勘探煤田又有新的发现
    中南煤矿地质局五零九号钻机工人提前完成全年计划
    半年多来，西北地区的煤田地质勘探工作继续有新的发现。经过普查和核对旧有资料，甘肃省的一块煤田发现煤系地层到处有露头。目前在这个煤田的勘探队正在进行地质填图，继续查明可采煤的层数、总厚度等情况。贺兰山附近经六二二队勘探证明煤藏量很多，煤层平均厚度有五公尺半，地质构造也不太复杂，煤的质量很好，具有焦性，经济价值很大。甘肃省六二五队勘探区，目前也已基本上掌握了新老区的地层构造情况，并探明新老区有丰富的储量。陕西铜川和甘肃阿干镇两个矿区的勘探工作，到八月底止，钻探已完成全年计划的百分之六十七；地质详查和地形测量工作已经大部完成。此外，西北地质部门的一个普查队还在陕西省郃阳一带新发现一片较好的煤田，为渭北煤田扩大勘探准备了条件。
    西北地区煤田地质勘探成果的取得，都是和几千个煤田勘探人员的辛勤劳动和艰苦奋斗分不开的。山丹钻探队由于执行了交接班制和技术责任制，连续四个月超额完成了国家计划，煤芯采取率平均达到百分之七十九；甘肃省和陕西省交界的两当、凤县一带的秦岭山上，到处有着地质人员的踪迹，其中有一个普查组并提前半个月完成了普查任务。　（新华社）
    中南煤矿地质局第一地质勘探队五零九号钻机工人已在八月份超额八十四公尺提前四个月完成了今年全年钻进计划。煤芯采取率最高的达到百分之百，平均达到百分之九八点四，超过国家计划百分之一四零点五七；岩芯采取率平均达到百分之八一点一五，超过国家计划百分之一零八点二零。并且基本上消灭了工伤事故。这个钻机的工人最近又订出了从九月到十二月再钻进八百公尺和节约六千四百万元的先进的增产节约计划。
    五零九号钻机工人去年是中南煤矿地质局第一地质勘探队的模范。今年他们接受的几个钻孔的任务，地层变化很大，有的还大量的漏水。因此他们每接受一个钻孔的任务时，先就根据钻孔的理想柱状图分析研究钻孔的地质情况来避免事故。他们又把增产的计划具体贯彻到作业计划中去，每天每班严格检查计划完成的情况。他们十分重视一分一秒钟的时间，以不断革新的精神提高生产效率和增加纯钻进时间。连换一换岩芯管的几分钟时间，也要设法利用。为了增加纯钻进时间和提高钻进效率，今年八个月中，他们创造改进的工具就有十三种。并且还推广了不少先进经验。今年八个月内，他们的纯钻进时间，就比一九五三年平均提高百分之四点六二；钻进效率提高百分之四十六点九。此外，他们还通过不断地进行技术革新和订立师徒合同等形式，培养提高工人的技术水平。　（新华社）
    铜川煤矿第三矿井井筒修建完成
    国营铜川煤矿第三矿井的井筒，经过三个多月修建，已经提前两天完工。安装好的机械经运转后，质量都很好，并在九月十五日正式提升煤炭。
    铜川煤矿第三矿井的矿层平均厚度有四公尺到五公尺，并出产部分炼焦煤。若以年产量十五万吨计算，可连续开采一百多年。但解放前，这个矿井的提升、运输等各种设备很简陋，因而经常发生落碴、掉块等事故。这次的修建，就是将原来直径不到两公尺的井筒扩大成四公尺，提升效率可以提高很多。　（新华社）
