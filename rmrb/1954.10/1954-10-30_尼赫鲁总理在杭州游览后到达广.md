At the banquet, Tao Zhu extended a warm welcome to Prime Minister Nehru for his re-arrival in Guangzhou as he was about to conclude his visit to China.

    Prime Minister Nehru also spoke at the banquet. He said: "Ten days ago, I passed through Guangzhou, and now I am passing through this great city again on my way back to India. These ten days, I have spent in the capital of this great country and some other great cities, and I have seen a part of this new face of an ancient country." Prime Minister Nehru said, "I have always believed that it is necessary and appropriate for India and China to cooperate to the greatest extent possible. My visit has made me feel this even more strongly. I firmly believe that for the benefit of our two countries, as well as the benefit of the whole world and world peace, our cooperation is very necessary." Prime Minister Nehru finally expressed his eternal gratitude for the friendship and hospitality he received throughout China during his visit, and proposed a toast to the health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, and to the prosperity of the Chinese people.
