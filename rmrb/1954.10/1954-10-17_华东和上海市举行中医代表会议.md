East China and Shanghai Municipality held a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Representative Meeting, which successfully concluded on October 14th. This meeting criticized past ideas that did not value TCM, further strengthened the unity between TCM practitioners, Western medicine practitioners, and health administration department cadres in the East China region and Shanghai, and exchanged experiences in TCM work, laying an ideological foundation for better carrying out TCM work.

At this meeting, Comrade Tan Zhenlin, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and secretary of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made important instructions. He said: Traditional Chinese medicine is a precious cultural heritage of our country, and has accumulated rich experience in the struggle against diseases for thousands of years, making great contributions to the health of the Chinese people and the survival of all ethnic groups in China. Therefore, it must be well studied and researched in order to inherit and carry forward our motherland's precious medical heritage. He also pointed out the deviations that existed in the East China and Shanghai health administration departments in implementing the policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine in the past five years. Then he said: Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine each have their own strengths and weaknesses. It was wrong to underestimate traditional Chinese medicine in the past; if we now pay attention to and value traditional Chinese medicine, it would also be wrong to underestimate Western medicine. He called on all Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to unite closely, learn from each other's strengths with a humble and sincere attitude, overcome each other's shortcomings, and exchange experiences. Comrade Tan Zhenlin's instructions greatly encouraged the participants. At this meeting, responsible comrades from the East China Administrative Committee Health Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, as well as the representatives present, examined the TCM work in the East China region and Shanghai in the past few years in a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and criticized the past ideas that did not value TCM. The representatives unanimously supported the people's government's policy of valuing TCM and expressed that in future work, they would take practical actions to implement the spirit of this meeting.

At this meeting, many famous TCM physicians specializing in internal medicine, bone and trauma, pediatrics, surgery, and acupuncture introduced their clinical treatment experience and tested effective prescriptions. The meeting called on the vast number of Chinese and Western medicine practitioners and health workers to strengthen their political theory and professional learning, strengthen academic exchanges, use the scientific viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to correctly treat the motherland's precious medical heritage, and carry it forward.

The meeting also decided to establish the Shanghai Municipal TCM Academic Research Committee, strengthen TCM association organizations, continue to handle TCM advanced studies, and appropriately add TCM management institutions in the health administration departments.
