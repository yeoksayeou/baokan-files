Dear comrades and friends:

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, please allow me to extend my heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Government, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and to extend warm fraternal greetings to the German Democratic Republic and all the German people.

October 7, 1949, is the day of the founding of the German Democratic Republic—a truly democratic and peace-loving Germany. Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin called this important and historic day a "turning point in European history," which expressed the thoughts and feelings of the Soviet people.

The victory over German militarism and the liberation of the German people from fascist rule opened up new prospects for the German people, for Germany. The founding of the German Democratic Republic proved the German people's desire to completely eliminate German militarism, to completely shatter all attempts to throw the German people into another imperialist war, and their desire to unswervingly embark on the path of national revival of a peaceful and democratic Germany.

Since the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the German people have resolutely embarked on a new path—the path of building a truly democratic and truly peace-loving Germany. This path was made possible because the power of the German Democratic Republic is in the hands of the working class and the working peasants, because this power is based on the support of all democratic and patriotic forces among the German people, and because the people here are their own masters. Today, there is no doubt that the German Democratic Republic expresses the noblest and most progressive aspirations of all the German people.

The German Democratic Republic has stood up in the complex domestic and international environment of the post-war period.

Of decisive significance is that here the rule of monopoly capital and the Junker landowners has been overthrown, and the industrial enterprises and land that originally belonged to them have become the property of the people. A new state and social system has been established, which excludes the possibility of any militarists influencing the political and economic life of the republic. The people are educated in the spirit of peace-loving labor and respect for the people of other countries.

After the working people of the German Democratic Republic took their destiny into their own hands, they began to build a new life and have achieved significant victories in all aspects of construction. Of course, it would be wrong to harbor illusions and think that everything will go smoothly without any difficulties.

Everyone knows that there are certain forces at home, and especially abroad, that are trying to obstruct the constructive efforts of the residents of the German Democratic Republic. They spare no effort to engage in various subversion and sabotage activities and other crimes to obstruct economic and cultural development and the further consolidation of the democratic system.

However, based on the experience of five years of construction work, we have ample reason to say that no force can stop the working people of the German Democratic Republic from advancing victoriously in the construction of their new life. The guarantee of this is the increasingly close unity of residents of all strata, who, in the struggle for peace and the unification of Germany, for improving the people's living standards and consolidating the democratic foundations of the republic, are united around the program of the National Front of Democratic Germany. This National Front, which includes workers, peasants, intellectuals, handicraftsmen, middle-class residents, small and medium-sized employers, and merchants, is an alliance of all patriotic forces among the German residents, an alliance aimed at building a unified, peace-loving, democratic, and prosperous Germany.

In the past five years, the German Democratic Republic has been politically and economically consolidated.

The democratic foundation of the republic has been strengthened. This is manifested in the deepening trust and increasingly active support of the working people of the German Democratic Republic for their government and leading democratic institutions. Here, I would like to mention the great Lenin's words about the importance of the masses' trust in their country. When talking about the achievements made by the Soviet Union in the first few years after its founding, Lenin emphasized that the foundation of these achievements was "the enormous trust we enjoyed and still enjoy among the broad masses."

The working people see that the task set by the German Democratic Republic for itself is to continuously develop the national economy, to develop national culture in various ways according to the interests of the working people, and to continuously strive for the welfare of the residents, especially the workers, peasants, and working intellectuals.

Under the difficult conditions of the post-war period, the working people of the German Democratic Republic have already made significant achievements in the work of restoring and developing various sectors of the national economy. For example, the fact that the industrial output of the German Democratic Republic has almost doubled to the level of 1936 before the war by the middle of this year can prove this point. There has been rapid development, especially recently, in heavy industry and machine manufacturing industry—the foundation of the German economy and German exports—as well as in the production of consumer goods.

The Soviet people watch with great pleasure the creative and constructive efforts of the working people of the German Democratic Republic, their efforts aimed at meeting the growing needs of the residents of the republic in food and manufactured goods, and their achievements in improving the quality of products and further developing agriculture.

The measures taken to develop various sectors of agriculture and promote the construction of rural cooperatives are gaining increasingly positive results.

The German Democratic Republic has made a great contribution to the German people by tirelessly upholding and developing Germany's rich national culture, educating and inspiring the broad masses of the working people.

In the republic's economic and cultural development, in its progress in industry and agriculture, and in raising the living standards of the working people, every new achievement will not only be of great significance for further mobilizing and consolidating the strength within the republic to build a new life, but also of great significance for the struggle for the unification of Germany. This achievement will enhance the attractive power of the German Democratic Republic as an expression of the legitimate aspirations of the German people who are fighting to ensure that their country can develop along a path of peace and democracy. Only along this path will the German people have the opportunity to fully express and develop their great creative power.

The German people, who have long been known to the world for their great achievements in culture, science, engineering, and art, also enjoyed a superior position internationally in the past. The German people, who have unswervingly embarked on the path of peaceful and democratic development, will greatly exceed their previous achievements.

The founding of the German Democratic Republic occupies a special place in the development of the situation in our time.

Here, all the forces among the German people who safeguard the freedom, happiness, and peace of all the German people have been united. The German Democratic Republic has abandoned the old imperialist path that West Germany is still taking, and they have bravely embarked on a new and truly democratic path. The German Democratic Republic has become a strong pillar of all peace-loving and democratic forces in Germany. This explains why it must occupy a special and glorious position in the realization of the basic national task of the German people—reuniting Germany into a democratic and peace-loving country.

The current situation of Germany being divided into two countries cannot continue indefinitely. No matter what obstacles the "Western" imperialist gentlemen and their servants in West Germany create to obstruct the restoration of Germany's unification, the German people will have their own unified, independent, and democratic country that coexists and develops peacefully and friendly with the people of other countries and with other peace-loving countries. Germany will be unified.

The forces currently ruling West Germany, headed by Adenauer, are stubbornly dragging the German people backward, attempting to force them to take the old road, the road of monopoly capital, the Junker aristocracy, and the rule of Hitler's generals, the road of the revival of German militarism, the road that leads to another war that can only become the greatest disaster for the people of all countries in Europe, especially the greatest threat to the German people. The main foundation of this policy is external support, dragging West Germany into various military blocs headed by the aggressors of the United States of America. This policy cannot be expected to receive strong support from the majority of the German people.

It is very clear that this policy can only be implemented at the expense of the basic interests of the German people, and this policy will only harm the possibility of an early solution to the problem of restoring Germany's unification. The broad masses are increasingly aware that this policy is very harmful from the perspective of the national interests of the German people. The growing dissatisfaction currently expressed by more and more Social Democratic workers with Adenauer's policy proves this. The decline in the strength of parties in West Germany that support the policy of re-militarization and the increase in the strength of parties that oppose this policy also prove this. All German democrats and patriots who understand that there is an inseparable link between the basic interests of the German people and the consolidation of peace in Europe will draw conclusions from this.

Taking all steps to promote the rapprochement between East and West Germany and the unity of the democratic and peace-loving forces of the German people—which is very important for restoring Germany's unification—is particularly important in the current situation. This includes taking economic and cultural measures—holding all-German conferences, establishing joint all-German institutions, exchanging more and more delegations to enable the broad masses to understand the actual situation in the two parts of Germany, and taking many other measures.

In all these things, the German Democratic Republic has received and will continue to receive increasing support from all the German people.

The strengthening of the unity of various forces in the National Front of Democratic Germany, the further consolidation of the alliance between the working class and the working peasants, and the correct political guidance of the German Democratic Republic—in this regard, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany plays an important role—can guarantee success on this path.

The working people see and recognize the outstanding contributions of German Democratic Republic President Wilhelm Pieck—a loyal son and time-tested leader of the German working class who is universally respected and loved by the German people—Comrade Grotewohl and Comrade Ulbricht, as well as their closest comrades-in-arms and other leaders of the republic who are currently so successfully leading the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, who have victoriously organized the German working class and strengthened the unity of all German democratic and patriotic forces. Their names will be recorded on the most brilliant pages of the new German history.

Today, on the glorious (fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic), we warmly congratulate the politicians, all innovators in production and leaders in culture, active workers and advanced workers, men and women workers, working peasants, intellectuals, and glorious progressive youth of the German Democratic Republic on the outstanding achievements of the German Democratic Republic, because their efforts have guaranteed the achievement of these achievements.

Germany and its working class have contributed to the world the brilliant founders of scientific communism, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who pointed out to the working people the true path to a better life. Under their guidance, the German workers' movement, due to its strength and organization, had been an example for socialist movements in other countries for decades. The working people of all countries gratefully remember the names of the heroic socialist fighters, the glorious representatives of the German workers' movement, August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and Ernst Thälmann. The ideas of Marx and Engels and the best traditions of the revolutionary struggle of the German working class live in the cause of the German Democratic Republic.

Dear comrades:

The relationship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic has been built on the basis of mutual trust and mutual assistance from the very beginning. The mutual obligations of our two countries during the post-war period have always been fulfilled with full awareness of their responsibilities and with a firm will to strengthen the friendship between our two peoples. Today, economic cooperation and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are constantly strengthening. Over the years, the friendly relations between our two countries have become more consolidated, which is a solid foundation for further strengthening the friendship between the Soviet and German peoples.

The Soviet Union has established relations with the German Democratic Republic that are the same as those with other sovereign countries. The German Democratic Republic can freely decide its internal affairs and foreign affairs according to its own will.

All of this proves the mutual trust and mutual understanding between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union.

As everyone knows, the Soviet side has proposed to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France the suggestion of withdrawing the occupying forces (except for certain extremely limited forces) from the territories of East and West Germany for consideration. Moreover, the Soviet government has also suggested that the four governments should reach an agreement, with the participation of the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, on the strength, distribution, and equipment of various forms of German police forces in the two parts of Germany.

At that time, this proposal was linked to the issue of all-German elections and the issue of signing a peace treaty.

Today, the Soviet government declares that it once again suggests to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that they reach an agreement on the issue of withdrawing the occupying forces from East and West Germany, and that this issue be resolved immediately without delay. Accepting this suggestion would improve the situation of the residents of East and West Germany. This would also create more favorable conditions for East and West Germany to reach reconciliation and thus reunite Germany. At the same time, this would show a willingness to ease international tensions and strengthen peace in Europe.

However, at the time when the Soviet side proposed that the relevant countries reach an agreement on the withdrawal of the occupying forces, there were plans in other areas that were directly opposite. In London and Bonn, a plan is being discussed to keep the occupying forces stationed in West Germany until 1998—no more, no less, until the end of this century. No matter what justifications may be made for this plan, it must be admitted that this plan has nothing in common with rebuilding Germany's true sovereignty or guaranteeing the true security of the people of European countries.

The Soviet Union's suggestion on withdrawing the occupying forces from the two parts of Germany proves the consistency of the peace-loving policy of the Soviet state, and also proves our people's unwavering trust in the German Democratic Republic. This also shows our desire to consolidate the relationship of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet people and the German people, which is of decisive significance for achieving lasting peace in Europe.

For a number of reasons, relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany have begun to develop on a healthier basis. In this regard, it is sufficient to mention the broad possibilities that can be utilized, for example, in mutually beneficial economic relations.

The German question is a major problem that has not yet been resolved since the end of the war. This has left its mark on the entire international situation, especially on the situation in Europe.

The Soviet Union advocates seeking a fundamental solution to the German question. Concluding a peace treaty with Germany could be such a fundamental solution.

There is no doubt that concluding a peace treaty with Germany in accordance with the basic principles of the Potsdam Agreement meets both the requirements of peace and security in Europe and the direct interests of the German people themselves.

There are many people in the West now talking about restoring West Germany's sovereignty. However, in reality, they are not talking about restoring sovereignty, but about enabling the militarists and revanchists in West Germany to freely implement the plan to revive German militarism without any restrictions. Only by concluding a peace treaty that meets both the interests of the German people and the interests of other peace-loving peoples in Europe can Germany's unification and true sovereignty be restored.

It cannot be considered accidental that the aggressors in Western countries, especially the United States, avoid talking about a peace treaty, remain silent on this issue, and are unwilling to fulfill their international obligations.

On the issue of concluding a peace treaty, the Soviet Union's interests are also completely consistent with the fundamental interests of the German people. The German people need a peace treaty that can rebuild Germany's unification and make Germany an independent, democratic, and peaceful country.

On this issue, the German people are guaranteed to receive full and unconditional support from the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.

The resolution of the German question, or any substantial progress in this question, will largely depend on the development of international relations.

Everyone cannot but notice that the international situation has recently improved to some extent. The struggle to ease international tensions has not been without results.

Last year, with the efforts of peace-loving countries—whose suggestions were supported by the Soviet Union—an armistice agreement was concluded in Korea. This armistice agreement ended the three-year war and had a positive impact on international relations.

The Berlin Conference held at the beginning of this year and the Geneva Conference held afterwards made it possible to take another step to ease international tensions. The end of the Indochina War proves this.

The Geneva Conference also showed that if countries show a genuine interest in consolidating peace and international security, consultations between countries can produce important and constructive results, can promote the normalization of international relations, and can resolve major international issues in Asia and Europe.

This also fully applies to the German question.

In the current situation, it is particularly important to fully clarify: what can truly promote the resolution of the German question, and what, on the contrary, can obstruct the resolution of this question, and not only that, can cause new and very dangerous complexities in the international situation.

It is very clear that in the current situation, resolving the issue of restoring Germany's unification is the main and most urgent prerequisite for resolving the German question. This will eliminate the obstacles that have not been eliminated so far that hinder the conclusion of a peace treaty.

However, we must take into account the fact that various activities have recently been carried out to begin a broad plan to re-militarize West Germany, thereby making it impossible to restore Germany's unification and independence. The purpose of these plans to revive German militarism is, on the one hand, to pull West Germany into a clear Western military alliance, and on the other hand, to indefinitely retain the occupation system in West Germany. Undoubtedly, the implementation of this plan is incompatible with restoring Germany's unification, not to mention the dangerous consequences this brings to peace in Europe.

Today, the question is this:

Either those who can decide this question will do everything possible to study and resolve this very urgent question—rebuilding Germany's unification, a question that the German people, as well as the peace-loving people of all European countries, are very concerned about; or—if the situation develops to the point of restoring German militarism and pulling West Germany into an aggressive military bloc, the German nation will remain in a state of division for a long period of time to come, and a re-militarized West Germany will directly threaten peace in Europe.

The Soviet Union's answer to this question is very clear.

The Soviet Union is in favor of no longer delaying the resolution of the issue of rebuilding Germany's unification, and it believes that the plan to re-militarize West Germany is incompatible with completing this task. The Soviet Union's position will certainly not be sympathized with by the militarists and revanchists in Germany, but this position is in line with the fundamental interests of the German people. As everyone knows, the German Democratic Republic also insists on this position.

It is said that the detailed plan for arming West Germany is out of the need to defend the security of Western Europe. However, it is by no means accidental that this plan has now caused serious concern among West Germany's neighboring countries. Since this plan advocates establishing a military bloc composed of several Western countries to oppose other countries in Europe, the implementation of this plan will not only not meet the needs of European security, but will instead deteriorate the international situation to such an extent that the danger of another European war will greatly increase.

It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Union opposes the policy of establishing hostile military blocs and the plan to re-militarize West Germany, and has proposed a draft European Collective Security Treaty.

This draft stipulates that all European countries, regardless of their social and national systems, should jointly strive to ensure the security of all countries in Eastern and Western Europe. This draft stipulates that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany can both participate, and after Germany's unification, the unified Germany can also participate.

Therefore, there is no reason to delay the restoration of Germany's unification. In this situation, the four countries—the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union—have a responsibility to do their best to facilitate the resolution of this issue.

As in the past, the Soviet Union believes that holding free all-German elections is necessary to achieve this goal. It is possible for the major powers to reach an agreement on this issue if they start from such an indisputable premise: that unifying Germany according to the direction of peace and democracy is the main task.

At the beginning of this year, no agreement could be reached at the Berlin Conference on the issue of holding free all-German elections. Now, immediately following the collapse of the "European Defense Community" plan, new possibilities have emerged for the positions of the four countries on this issue to become closer. The Soviet government, for its part, is prepared to consider the suggestions previously made by the participants in the Berlin Conference, as well as new suggestions that may be made on the issue of free all-German elections.

Needless to say, the Soviet Union's negative attitude towards the plan to re-militarize West Germany also applies to the "European Defense Community" and all other plans of this nature, regardless of what disguise these plans take. It can also be seen from this that all new attempts to re-militarize West Germany, including the London Conference, are incompatible with sincere efforts to restore Germany's unification.

Up to now, those who advocate re-militarizing West Germany and including West Germany in military blocs—in fact, there are many who oppose doing so—have often said that if the major powers can find a basis for reaching an agreement on the issue of disarmament and atomic weapons, then the situation will be different. In this regard, they also directly mentioned the French-British suggestion submitted to the United Nations in June this year. Now these words have also lost all meaning.

As everyone knows, the Soviet government has suggested using the above-mentioned French-British suggestion as the basis for corresponding international agreements, because these suggestions, after some modifications, do not contradict the principles advocated by the Soviet government for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. This situation provides the possibility of reaching an agreement on these important issues, and this fact must not be ignored when considering the German question now.

However, people must not put forward plans for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons on the one hand, and on the other hand, start re-militarizing West Germany and pulling it into military blocs. These two things are clearly incompatible with each other.

It can be seen from this that in order to consolidate peace in Europe and for the sake of the interests of the German people themselves, the plan to re-militarize West Germany must be abandoned, and all efforts must be focused on resolving the basic and urgent task in the near future—reuniting Germany into a democratic and peace-loving country.

Dear comrades and friends! A few days ago, we celebrated a day of great significance—the fifth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China.

All those who truly safeguard freedom and international peace cheer for this victory of the Chinese people's revolution, which marks a fundamental turning point in the development of Asia and the entire East, and its significance cannot be overestimated no matter how it is evaluated. This is a sign of the times, which shows that 600 million Chinese people, under the leadership of their Communist Party, have been freed from the shackles of foreign imperialism and feudal landlord oppression, and now, a broad, historic path towards the development of their entire economic life and national culture, towards freedom and prosperity, towards brightness and socialism, is unfolding before them.

Therefore, the People's Republic of China has become a powerful factor in developing the international situation in a direction conducive to peace, democracy, and socialism.

Today, we celebrate another day of great significance—the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

In these five years, the German Democratic Republic has not only consolidated and developed its strength, but has also become a reliable fortress of peace-loving and democratic forces among all the German people. This is the German people's fortune. It now openly tells the German people that the old road, that is, the road of restoring German militarism, is a suicidal road for the German nation, and there is another road, a new road, which truly conforms to the interests of the German people and the consolidation of world peace. The existence of the German Democratic Republic and the continuous growth of its strength itself proves that the German people have every possibility on a new road to once again become a great nation and occupy a proper position among the people of the world.

The significance of the fact that the German Democratic Republic has the support of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the entire camp of peace, democracy, and socialism on the international stage cannot be overestimated. Now the border of this camp has stretched from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the shores of the Pacific Ocean.

Dear comrades!

The Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have entrusted our delegation to convey the following congratulatory message:

"To Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic
To the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic
To the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council
of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on behalf of the Soviet people, extend fraternal greetings and heartfelt congratulations to you and all the German people.

Under the difficult conditions of the post-war period, the German Democratic Republic has made outstanding achievements in all aspects of national construction, in the development of a peaceful economy, in the improvement of culture and science, and in the improvement of the material welfare of the residents.

Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the German Democratic Republic has implemented profound social reforms. The working class and the peasants have formed a solid alliance and united all the democratic and patriotic forces of the German people in the National Front, leading this front in the struggle against the threat of the revival of German militarism, for the unification of the motherland, and for Germany to embark on the road of democratic and peaceful development.

Due to the implementation of a peaceful and friendly policy with the people of all countries, the German Democratic Republic has established prestige internationally, gained trust, and achieved a deserved position among all peace-loving countries. The German Democratic Republic has become an obstacle in the path of militarist and revanchist forces, whose policy is to drag the German people into a new war in which Germany will suffer all the disastrous consequences. All democratic and patriotic forces of the German people regard the German Democratic Republic as a reliable fortress in their struggle to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful Germany.

The Soviet people note with deep satisfaction the great achievements made by the working people of the German Democratic Republic, and sincerely wish the German working class, peasants, intellectuals, and all the German people new victories in the struggle for the unification of the motherland, for peace, and for the construction of a peaceful and democratic Germany.

Long live the German Democratic Republic!

May the unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Germany grow and consolidate!

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union
The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"

(When V.M. Molotov spoke, the people present listened very attentively, and his speech was often interrupted by enthusiastic and prolonged applause.)

### 在德意志民主共和国成立五周年庆祝大会上  莫洛托夫同志的演说

专栏：

    在德意志民主共和国成立五周年庆祝大会上
    莫洛托夫同志的演说亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    在德意志民主共和国成立五周年的时候，请允许我代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联政府和苏联共产党中央委员会，代表苏联人民，向你们致衷心的祝贺，并向德意志民主共和国和全体德国人民致热烈的兄弟祝贺。
    一九四九年十月七日是德意志民主共和国——一个真正民主和爱好和平的德国——成立的日子。约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林把这个重要的、具有历史意义的日子称为“欧洲历史的转折点”，这表达了苏联人民的思想和感情。
    战胜德国军国主义和德国人民从法西斯统治下得到解放，为德国人民、为德国展开了新的前途。德意志民主共和国的成立证明了德国人民要彻底消灭德国军国主义、彻底粉碎要把德国人民投入另一次帝国主义战争的一切企图的愿望，证明了他们要坚定不移地走和平和民主德国的民族复兴的道路的愿望。
    自从德意志民主共和国成立以来，德国人民就坚决地走上了新的道路——建立一个真正民主和真正爱好和平的德国的道路。走上这一条道路之所以成为可能，是因为德意志民主共和国的权力是掌握在工人阶级和劳动农民的手中，是因为这种权力是以德国人民中的一切民主与爱国力量的支持为基础的，是因为这里的人民自己就是主人。今天，毫无疑问的，德意志民主共和国表达了全体德国人民的最崇高的和进步的愿望。
    德意志民主共和国已在战后时期的复杂的国内和国际环境中站起来了。
    具有决定意义的是：在这里，垄断资本和容克地主的统治被推翻了，原来属于他们的工业企业和土地成了人民的财产。新的国家和社会制度已建立起来，这就排斥了任何军国主义分子对共和国的政治和经济生活发生影响的可能性。人民受着爱好和平劳动和尊重其他国家人民的精神的教育。
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民把他们的命运掌握在自己手中之后，就开始建设新生活，并且已在建设事业的一切方面取得了重大的胜利。当然，如果怀抱幻想、认为一切都会很顺利、没有任何困难，那就错了。
    大家都知道，在国内、尤其是在国外有着某种企图阻挠德意志民主共和国居民的建设性努力的势力。它们不惜采取各种颠覆和破坏行动以及其他罪行来阻挠经济和文化发展以及民主制度的进一步巩固。
    但是，根据五年来的建设工作的经验，我们有充分的理由可以说，没有任何力量能阻挠德意志民主共和国的劳动人民在他们的新生活的建设中胜利前进。这一点的保证就是各阶层居民的日益紧密的团结，他们在争取和平和德国的统一，争取提高人民的生活水平和巩固共和国的民主基础的斗争中，团结在民主德国全国阵线的纲领的周围。这个包括工人、农民、知识分子、手工业者以及中层居民、中小雇主和商人的全国阵线是德国居民中一切爱国力量的联盟，是一个目的在于建成一个统一的、爱好和平的、民主的和繁荣的德国的联盟。
    在过去五年中，德意志民主共和国在政治和经
  济上巩固了。
    共和国的民主基础加强了。这表现在德意志民主共和国劳动人民对他们的政府和各领导民主机构
  的日益加深的信任和日益积极的支持上。在这里，
  我希望提一提伟大的列宁所说的关于人民群众对他
  们国家信任的重要性的话。列宁在谈到苏联在建国
  后的最初几年中所取得的成就时着重指出，这些成
  就的基础是“取得了我们过去和现在在广大群众中
  享有的巨大的信任”。
      劳动人民看到，德意志民主共和国为它自己规
  定的任务是不断发展国民经济，根据劳动人民的利
  益用各种方法发展民族文化和不断地为居民的福
  利、首先是工人、农民和劳动知识分子的福利而努
  力。
      在战后的困难条件下，德意志民主共和国的劳
  动人民已在恢复和发展国民经济各部门的工作中取
  得了重大的成就。例如，到今年年中，德意志民主共和国的工业产量几乎已经增为战前一九三六年的两倍，这个事实就可证明这一点。在重工业和机器制造工业——德国经济和德国出口的基础——以及消费品的生产方面，特别是在最近，都有迅速的发展。
    苏联人民以非常愉快的心情注视着德意志民主共和国劳动人民的创造性的和建设性的努力，注视着他们的目的在于满足这个共和国的居民在食品和制成品方面的日益增长的需要的努力以及他们在提高产品的质量和进一步发展农业方面的成就。
    为发展农业各部门和促进农村合作社建设而采取的措施正在获得越来越肯定的成绩。
    德意志民主共和国孜孜不倦地维护和发展德意志的丰富的民族文化，教育和启发广大的劳动人民群众，从而对德国人民作了巨大的贡献。
    在共和国的经济和文化发展方面，在它的工业和农业进展方面以及在提高劳动人民的生活水平方面，每一个新的成就，将不仅对于进一步动员和巩固共和国内的力量来建设新生活具有很大的意义，而且对于争取德国统一的斗争也具有重大的意义。这种成就将增强德意志民主共和国作为正在为保证他们的国家有可能沿着和平和民主的道路发展而奋斗的德国人民的合法愿望的表达者的吸引力量。只有沿着这条道路，德国人民才有机会充分表现和发挥他们的伟大的创造力量。
    早已以文化、科学、工程和艺术方面的伟大成就闻名于世的德国人民，在现在以前也在国际上享有优越的地位。坚定不移地走上了和平与民主发展道路的德国人民将会大大地超过他们以往的成就。
    德意志民主共和国的成立在我们时代的局势发展中占着特殊的地位。
    这里已把德国人民中一切维护全德人民的自由、幸福和和平的力量团结在一起。德意志民主共和国已摒弃了德国西部仍在走着的帝国主义的老路，他们已勇敢地走上了新的真正民主的道路。德意志民主共和国已成为全德爱好和平的民主力量的坚强支柱。这就说明了为什么它必须在实现德国人民的基本民族任务——把德国重新统一成为一个民主和爱好和平的国家——方面占着特殊的光荣地位。
    目前这种德国分裂为两个国家的情况，不能无止境地继续下去。不管“西方”的帝国主义者先生们和他们在西德的仆从们会制造什么障碍来阻挠德意志国家恢复统一，但是德国人民将有他们自己的与其他国家的人民、与其他爱好和平的国家和平友好地生存与发展的，统一、独立和民主的国家。德国将会统一起来。
    以阿登纳为首的目前统治着西德的势力正在顽固地拖着德国人民开倒车，企图强迫他们走上老路，走上垄断资本、容克贵族和希特勒将军统治的道路，走上德国军国主义复活的道路，走上导向只能成为欧洲所有国家人民的最大灾难、尤其是对德国人民的最大威胁的另一次战争的道路。这种政策的主要基础是外来的支持，是把西德拖入以美利坚合众国的侵略分子为首的各种军事集团。这种政策是不能指望得到大多数德国人民的有力支持的。
    十分清楚，这种政策只能在牺牲德国人民的基本利益的情况下实行，这种政策只会损害早日解决恢复德国统一问题的可能性。广大的群众越来越清楚地认识到，从德国人民的民族利益的观点来看，这种政策的害处是很大的。越来越多的社会民主党工人目前对阿登纳的政策所表示的日益增长的不满证明了这一点。西德境内赞成重新军国主义化政策的党派的势力的衰退和反对这种政策的党派的势力的增长同样证明了这一点。所有明了德国人民的基本利益和欧洲和平的巩固之间有着不可分割的联系的德国民主人士和爱国者都会从这里得出结论。
    采取一切步骤以促进东德和西德之间的接近和德国人民的民主和爱好和平力量的团结——这对恢复德国统一是非常重要的——在目前的情况下特别重要。这包括采取经济和文化方面的措施——举行全德会议、设立联合的全德机构、互派越来越多的代表团，使广大群众互相了解德国两部分的实际情况，以及采取其他许多措施。
    在所有这些事情上，德意志民主共和国目前已得到，并将继续得到全体德国人民越来越大的支持。
    民主德国全国阵线中各种力量的团结的加强、工人阶级和劳动农民联盟的进一步巩固、德意志民主共和国的正确的政治指导——在这方面，起着重要作用的是德国统一社会党——可以保证在这条道路上取得成功。
    劳动人民看到和认识到，德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克——受到德国人民普遍的尊重和爱戴的德国工人阶级的忠实儿子和久经考验的领袖——格罗提渥同志和乌布利希同志以及他们最亲密的战友和目前正在如此顺利地领导着德国统一社会党的这个共和国的其他领袖们的杰出的贡献，就是把德国工人阶级胜利地组织了起来和加强了所有德国民主力量和爱国力量的团结。他们的名字将被记载在新的德国历史的最光辉的几页上。
    今天，在光荣的（民主德国建国）五周年纪念日，我们向德意志民主共和国的政治家、所有的生产革新者和文化领袖、积极的工人和先进工人、男女工人、劳动农民、知识分子和光荣的进步青年热烈祝贺德意志民主共和国的卓越成就，因为他们的努力保证了这些成就的取得。
    德国和它的工人阶级为全世界贡献了科学的共产主义的光辉创始者卡尔·马克思和弗雷德里希·恩格斯，他们为劳动人民指出了走向美好生活的真正道路。在他们指导下的德国工人运动，由于它的力量和组织，曾在数十年间一直是其他国家社会主义运动的榜样。一切国家的劳动人民都以感激的心情怀念着英勇的社会主义战士、德国工人运动的光荣的代表们奥古斯特·倍倍尔、威廉·李卜克内西、卡尔·李卜克内西、罗萨·卢森堡和恩斯特·台尔曼的名字。马克思和恩格斯的思想和德国工人阶级革命斗争的最优秀的传统活在德意志民主共和国的事业里。
    亲爱的同志们：
    苏联和德意志民主共和国的关系从一开始就建立在互相信任和互相帮助的基础上。我们两国在战后期间的相互义务一直是在双方充分意识到他们的责任和共同具有加强我们两国人民友谊的坚定意志的情况下履行的。今天，苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的经济合作和文化关系正在不断地加强。这些年来，我们两国间的友好关系已更加巩固了，这是进一步加强苏联人民和德国人民之间的友谊的巩固基础。
  苏联已与德意志民主共和国建立了和与其他主权国家相同的关系。德意志民主共和国可以按照它自己的意志自由地决定它的内政和外交事务。
    这一切都证明了德意志民主共和国和苏联之间的相互信任和相互谅解。
    大家知道，苏联方面已提出了从东德和西德领土上撤退占领军（除了某些极其有限的部队以外）的建议，以供美国、英国和法国政府考虑。而且，苏联政府还建议，四国政府应在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国政府的参加下，就德国两部分的各种形式的德国警察的力量、分配和装备问题达成协议。
    那时，这个建议是和全德选举问题以及签订和约问题联系在一起的。
    今天，苏联政府声明，它再度向美、英、法三国政府建议，就从东德和西德撤退占领军问题达成协议，并且不拖延地立即解决这个问题。接受这个建议就会使东德和西德居民的境况好一些。这也会为东德和西德达成和解从而重新统一德国创造比较有利的条件。同时，这样就可以表明对缓和国际紧张局势和加强欧洲和平的愿望。
    但是，在苏联方面提出有关国家就撤出占领军达成协议的建议的时候，在其他方面却有着直接相反的计划。在伦敦和波恩，正在讨论一个让占领军在西德一直驻留到一九九八年——不多不少地一直驻留到这个世纪的末尾的计划。不论为这种计划可能作什么辩解，必须承认，这种计划和重建德国的真正主权或保障欧洲各国人民的真正安全都无共同之处。
    苏联关于从德国两部分地区撤出占领军的建议证明了苏维埃国家的爱好和平政策的一贯性，同时也证明了我们人民对德意志民主共和国不可动摇的信赖。这也表明了我们要使苏维埃人民和德意志人民巩固地建立起对取得欧洲持久和平具有决定意义的友谊和合作的关系的愿望。
    由于不少的理由，苏联和德意志联邦共和国的关系已开始在更健康的基础上发展。在这方面，只要提出例如在互利的经济关系方面可以利用的广泛可能性就足够了。
    德国问题是战后尚未解决的一个主要问题。这在整个国际形势中，首先是在欧洲形势中烙下了印记。
    苏联主张求得德国问题的根本解决。与德国缔结和约能够成为这样一种根本解决的办法。
    毫无疑问，依据波茨坦协定的基本原则与德国缔结和约既符合欧洲和平与安全的要求，又符合德国人民本身的直接利益。
    现在西方有许多人在谈论恢复西德主权的问题。可是，实际上，他们谈的不是恢复主权问题，而是要使西德的军国主义分子和复仇主义分子能不受任何拘束地实行复活德国军国主义计划的问题。只有缔结一个既符合德国人民的利益，又符合欧洲其他爱好和平的各国人民的利益的和约，才能恢复德国的统一和真正的主权。
    不能认为，西方国家的、特别是美国的侵略分子避免谈到和约，在这个问题上保持沉默而且不愿履行它们所负担的国际义务是偶然的。
    在缔结和约问题上，苏联的利益与德国人民的根本利益也完全是一致的。德国人民需要一个能够重建德国的统一、使德国成为一个独立的、民主的和和平的国家的和约。
    在这个问题上，德国人民有保证可以得到苏联以及其他爱好和平国家的充分的、无条件的支持。
    德国问题的解决，要在这个问题上取得任何实质的进展，在很大程度上将依靠于国际关系的发展。
    大家不能不注意到国际形势最近有了一定的改善。争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争不是没有结果的。
    去年，在爱好和平的国家——它们的建议得到了苏联的支持——的努力下，在朝鲜缔结了停战协定。这个停战协定结束了三年之久的战争，对国际关系产生了积极的影响。
    今年年初举行的柏林会议以及随后举行的日内瓦会议使得采取又一步骤来缓和国际紧张局势成为可能。印度支那战争的结束就证明了这一点。
    日内瓦会议同时表明，如果各国表现出真正有兴趣来巩固和平与国际安全，各国之间的协商是能够产生重要的、建设性的结果的，是能够促进国际关系的正常化和解决亚洲与欧洲的重大国际问题的。
    这对德国问题也完全适用。
    在目前情况下，特别重要的是充分阐明：究竟什么东西能够真正促进德国问题的解决，什么东西正好相反，能够阻挠这个问题的解决，而且不止于此，能够使国际形势产生新的、十分危险的复杂性。
    十分明显，在目前情况下，解决恢复德国统一的问题是解决德国问题的主要的、最迫切的先决条件。这将消除到现在为止一直没有能消除的妨碍缔结和约的障碍。
    但是，我们必须考虑到这样一个事实：最近有人已经进行了各种活动来开始一个使西德重新军国主义化，从而使恢复德国的统一与独立成为不可能的广泛的计划。这些复活德国军国主义的计划的目的一方面在于把西德拉进明确的西方国家军事联盟，同时也在于无限期地保留西德的占领制度。无疑地，这种计划的执行是与恢复德国的统一不相容的，更不要谈这为欧洲和平带来的危险的后果了。
    在今天，问题是这样的：
    要么是那些能决定这个问题的人尽一切力量来研究和解决这个非常迫切的问题——重建德国的统一，这个问题是德国人民，同时也是欧洲各国爱好和平的人民所非常关心的问题；要么是——假如形势发展到恢复德国军国主义和把西德拉入侵略性的军事集团的地步，德国民族在今后很长时期以内仍将处于分裂的状态，而重新军国主义化的西德会直接地威胁欧洲的和平。
    苏联对于这个问题的回答是很清楚的。
    苏联赞成不再拖延解决重建德国统一的问题，它认为，使西德重新军国主义化的计划是和完成这种任务不相容的。苏联的这种立场当然不会得到德国的军国主义分子和复仇主义分子的同情，但是这种立场是符合德国人民的根本利益的。大家知道，德意志民主共和国也坚持这种立场。
    据说，关于武装西德的周密的计划是出于保卫西欧安全的需要。不过，这种计划现在已经引起西德各邻国的严重的忧虑，这绝不是偶然的事。由于这种计划主张建立一个由好几个西方国家组成的军事集团去反对欧洲的其他国家，所以，执行这种计划非但绝不能满足欧洲安全的需要，反而会使国际形势如此恶化，以致于另一次欧洲大战的危险会大大地增加。
    正是由于这个原因，苏联反对建立敌对的军事集团的政策和使西德重新军国主义化的计划，并提出了欧洲集体安全条约草案。
    这个草案规定，所有的欧洲国家，不论它们的社会及国家制度有何不同，共同为了保障东西欧各国的安全而努力。这个草案规定德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国都可以参加，在德国统一以后，统一了的德国也可以参加。
    因此，延迟恢复德国的统一是没有道理的。在这种情况下，四国——美国、英国、法国和苏联——有责任尽它们的力量设法促成这个问题的解决。
    和过去一样，苏联认为，为了达到这个目的，举行全德自由选举是必要的。各大国在这个问题上达成协议是可能的，如果它们从这样一个无可争辩的前提出发，即：认为按照和平和民主的方针统一德国是主要的任务。
    今年年初，在柏林会议上没有能就举行全德自由选举问题达成协议。现在，紧接着“欧洲防务集团”计划的垮台，四国在这个问题上所持的主张更加接近的新的可能性已经出现。苏联政府在它这方面准备考虑柏林会议的参与国以前提出的建议以及在全德自由选举问题上可能提出的新建议。
    用不着说，苏联对西德重新军国主义化计划采取的否定态度同样适用于对“欧洲防务集团”和其他一切这种性质的计划，不论这些计划采取什么样的伪装。由此还可以看出，使西德重新军国主义化的一切新的企图，包括伦敦会议在内，都是与致力于恢复德国的统一的真诚努力不相容的。
    到现在为止，鼓吹西德重新军国主义化和把西德包括到军事集团中去的人——事实上还有许多反对这样做的人——都经常在说，如果大国能就裁减军备和原子问题找到达成协议的基础，那么，局势就会不同了。他们在这方面还直接提到今年六月提交联合国的法国—英国建议。现在这些话也丧失全部意义了。
    大家知道，苏联政府已经建议把上述法国—英国建议作为相应的国际协定的基础，因为这些建议在经过一些修改后和苏联政府对裁减军备和禁止原子武器所主张的原则并不矛盾。这种情况提供了就这些重要问题达成协议的可能性，现在考虑德国问题时决不能忽视这个事实。
      但是，人们决不能一面提出裁减军备和禁止原子武器的计划，同时又着手使西德重新军国主义化，并把它拉入军事集团。这两件事显然是彼此不相容的。
    由此可见，为了巩固欧洲和平和为了德国人民自身的利益，必须放弃使西德重新军国主义化的计划，一切力量必须集中于解决在最近的将来的基本而迫切的任务——使德国重新统一成为一个民主的、爱好和平的国家。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！几天以前，我们庆祝了一个具有重大意义的日子——伟大的中华人民共和国成立五周年纪念日。
      所有真正维护自由和国际和平的人们都为中国人民革命的这个胜利而欢呼，这个胜利标志着亚洲和整个东方的发展中的一个根本的转捩点，它的意义之重大是无论怎样估计都不会过分的。这是一个时代的标志，它表明，六亿中国人民在他们的共产党的领导下，已经摆脱了外国帝国主义和封建地主压迫的枷锁，现在，他们面前展开着一条走向他们的全部经济生活和民族文化的发展、走向自由和繁荣、光明和社会主义的宽阔的、历史性的道路。
    因此，中华人民共和国已经成为使国际局势向着有利于和平、民主和社会主义的方向发展的强有力的因素。
    今天，我们庆祝另一个意义重大的日子——德意志民主共和国成立五周年。
    在这五年中，德意志民主共和国不仅巩固了和发展了它的力量，并且已成为全体德国人民中爱好和平和民主力量的一个可靠的堡垒。这是德国人民的幸运。它现在公开地告诉德国人民，旧的道路，也就是恢复德国军国主义的道路，对德意志民族说来，是一条自杀的道路，另外还有一条道路，一条新的道路，这是真正符合于德国人民和巩固世界和平的利益的道路。德意志民主共和国的存在和它的力量的不断增长本身就证明了：德国人民在一条新的道路上有一切可能重新成为一个伟大的民族，在世界各国人民中间占据一个应有的地位。
    德意志民主共和国在国际舞台上有苏联、中华人民共和国以及整个和平、民主和社会主义阵营的支持，对这一事实的意义作如何高的估价也不为过。现在这一阵营的边界已由大西洋岸边一直伸延到太平洋岸边。
    亲爱的同志们！
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会委托我们代表团转达下面的贺词：
      “德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克同志
    德意志民主共和国部长会议
      德国统一社会党中央委员会
    在德意志民主共和国成立五周年的时候，苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会代表苏联人民向你们和全体德国人民致以兄弟的敬礼和衷心的祝贺。
    德意志民主共和国在战后困难的条件下，在国家建设的各个方面，在发展和平经济方面，在提高文化和科学方面，在增进居民的物质福利方面，取得了杰出的成就。
    在德国统一社会党的领导下，德意志民主共和国实行了深刻的社会改革。工人阶级和农民结成了巩固的联盟，并把德国人民的一切民主和爱国力量团结在全国阵线中，领导这一阵线进行斗争，以反对德国军国主义复活的威胁，争取祖国的统一，争取德国走上民主与和平发展的道路。
    德意志民主共和国由于执行了和平的和与各国人民友好的政策，在国际上建立了威信，得到了信任，在各个爱好和平的国家中取得了应得的地位。德意志民主共和国已成为军国主义和复仇主义势力的道路上的障碍，这种势力的政策是要把德国人民拖入将由德国自食其全部灾难后果的新战争。德国人民的一切民主和爱国力量把德意志民主共和国看作他们在争取建立统一、独立、民主和和平的德国的斗争中的可靠的堡垒。
    苏联人民以深深满意的心情注意到德意志民主共和国劳动人民所取得的巨大成就，并衷心地祝德国工人阶级、农民、知识分子和全体德国人民，在争取祖国统一、争取和平和建设和平、民主的德国的斗争中取得新的胜利。
    德意志民主共和国万岁！
    祝德苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊增长和巩固！
        苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃
            主席团
        苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议
