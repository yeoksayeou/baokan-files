To the Editor:

Since the Yangtze River Shipping Administration implemented the joint river-sea transportation of grain in April of this year, it has basically completed the grain transportation task. However, problems such as imbalanced grain dispatch, large-scale backlog, and poor storage still exist in the transportation work.

In the past few months, the Yangtze River shipping departments have been inconsistent in grain dispatch, failing to proceed according to plan. Taking the grain dispatch situation at Chongqing Port in April as an example, only 20.38 percent of the monthly transportation task was completed in the first ten days of the month; 35.09 percent was completed in the middle ten days; and 47.49 percent was completed in the last ten days. If the port of origin cannot dispatch grain evenly according to plan, it will inevitably affect the intermediate and destination ports' ability to transship and receive grain evenly, which will lead to a situation of looseness at the beginning of the month, tightness in the middle of the month, and rushing at the end of the month along the Yangtze River and at sea.

Due to the failure to transport evenly according to plan, grain often accumulates in large quantities at the ports of origin and intermediate ports after concentration. Hankou and Yichang ports have frequently experienced large-scale grain accumulation since May. On May 21, over 27,000 tons of grain were backlogged at Hankou Port, with the backlog time ranging from ten days to more than a month. Among them, a batch of broken rice shipped from Chongqing to Tianshenggang was backlogged for 32 days successively in Yichang and Hankou ports. 1,638 packages of broken rice shipped from Wanxian, Sichuan, to Nanjing were backlogged for 23 days at Hankou Port. The accumulation of grain at the ports not only wastes storage fees but also prevents some transportation tools and warehouses at the ports from being turned over in a timely manner. For example, the grain concentrated for dispatch at Chongqing Port is sent from various parts of Sichuan Province by train and wooden boats. The shipping department's delay in unloading the grain not only occupies the freight yards and warehouses of the wooden boats and railways but also directly affects the destination port's grain receiving units from receiving grain evenly. For example, of the 3,650 tons of grain that should have been transferred from Chongqing to Zhenjiang in April, only 320 tons were actually transferred. However, on June 3, Zhenjiang received 6,100 tons of grain in one day. The grain receiving plan of the destination port's grain receiving units is based on local needs. If less grain is received, it will directly affect the planned grain supply work; if too much grain is transported, the grain receiving units will be rushed and have difficulty unloading.

In addition, many grains are damaged in transit due to the shipping department's inadequate storage work. Incomplete statistics from the Hankou Port Authority show that among the Sichuan grain transported by the port in April, May, and June, more than 10,800 packages suffered accidents such as rain dampness, water immersion, mildew, and stains. We have personally seen the shipping department often loading and unloading grain in rainy weather or piling grain randomly on the riverbank. On May 21, after the Chongqing Port's Heping No. 17 ship sent 30,947 packages of brown rice to Hankou, the personnel of the Hankou Port Authority randomly piled the grain on the dock freight yard, resulting in 228 packages becoming damp and moldy, and some even sprouted. The Hankou Port Authority's education on protecting state grain for warehouse cadres and workers is insufficient. Some workers casually allow people to sweep up the remaining grain in the freight yard. During loading and unloading, it is often seen that workers are wearing straw sandals and stepping on the grain piles.

We are grain workers, and we find the above situation intolerable. We hope that the relevant departments will pay attention to improving this situation.

### 长江各港发运粮食计划性太差

    长江各港发运粮食计划性太差编辑同志：
    长江航运管理局所属各航运部门，自今年四月开始实行粮食江海联运以来，虽然基本上完成了粮食运输任务，但在运输工作中还存在着粮食发运不平衡、大量积压和保管不善等情况。
    几个月来，长江区航运部门发运粮食时忽松忽紧，不能按计划进行。以重庆港四月份发运粮食的情况为例，上旬只完成全月运输任务的百分之二十点三八；中旬完成百分之三十五点零九；下旬完成了百分之四十七点四九。起运港不能均衡地按计划发运，就必然影响中转港、目的港不能均衡地中转和接收粮食，也就使长江沿线和海上的运输都陷于月初松、月中紧、月终赶的情况中。
    由于不能按计划均衡运输，起运港、中转港粮食集中后经常大量积压。汉口、宜昌两港，从五月起就经常大量积压粮食。五月二十一日，积压在汉口港的就有二万七千余吨粮食，积压的时间由十几天到一个月以上不等。其中由重庆运到天生港去的一批碛米在宜昌、汉口两港先后积压了三十二天。由四川万县运到南京去的碛米一千六百三十八包，在汉口港就积压了二十三天。粮食积压在港口，不仅白白化费了囤留费的开支，并使港口上的一些交通运输工具及仓库不能及时得到周转。如集中在重庆港发运的粮食，都是四川省各地通过火车、木船送来的，航运部门迟迟不卸运粮食，不仅木船、铁路方面的货场、堆栈被粮食占住了，而且直接影响到目的港的收粮单位不能均衡地收到粮食。如四月份由重庆调到镇江去的粮食应有三千六百五十吨，实际上只调到了三百二十吨；但六月三日一天中，镇江就收到粮食六千一百吨。目的港收粮单位的收粮计划是根据当地需要情况订出来的，收到的粮食少，就直接影响到粮食计划供应工作；如果粮食运到过多，收粮单位就会手忙脚乱，起卸困难。
    此外，许多粮食在运输途中，因航运部门保管工作做得不够好而受到损失。从汉口港务局内部不完全的统计中，可以看出该港四、五、六月承运四川粮食中，先后发生雨湿、水浸、霉变、污渍等事故的有一万零八百多包。我们亲眼看到，航运部门常常在雨天装卸粮食，或随意把粮食堆在江边。五月二十一日，重庆港和平轮十七号送三万零九百四十七包糙米到汉口后，汉口港务局人员就随意把粮食堆在码头货场上，结果有二百二十八包发生潮湿、霉变，有的甚至生芽了。汉口港务局对仓库干部和工人的爱护国家粮食的教育很不够。有些工人随便让群众到货场中去扫地脚粮。在装卸中，经常看见工人穿着草鞋在粮堆上踩来踩去。
    我们是粮食工作人员，看到以上情况，觉得是不能容忍的，希望有关部门重视改进这种情况。
