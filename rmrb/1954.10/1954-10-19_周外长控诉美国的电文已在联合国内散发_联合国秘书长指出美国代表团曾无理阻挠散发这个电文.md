Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth of the month dispatch from New York: Secretary-General of the United Nations, Hammarskjöld, has distributed the telegram from our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai accusing the United States of aggression against Taiwan to the member states of the United Nations. Hammarskjöld also issued a statement on the fifteenth, stating that the US delegation had unreasonably obstructed him from distributing this telegram. He said: This behavior of the US delegation was a request for him to "violate past well-established practices," and he believed that there was "no reason to violate established procedures."

This unreasonable action by the US delegation has also aroused dissatisfaction among other UN personnel. Associated Press reporter Roberts reported on the sixteenth that the attitude adopted by the United States "has made it suspected of having a guilty conscience, especially in the eyes of Asians." The reporter also pointed out that the US attitude has become the subject of much discussion among many national delegations. Some representatives believe that this is "almost a naive approach." Other representatives said with sarcasm, "This is due to the lack of diplomatic training of certain State Department personnel in New York and Washington."

    周外长控诉美国的电文已在联合国内散发
    联合国秘书长指出美国代表团曾无理阻挠散发这个电文
    【新华社十八日讯】纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德已将我国周恩来外长控诉美国侵略台湾的电文，散发给联合国会员国。哈马舍尔德并于十五日发表了一项声明，说明美国代表团曾无理阻挠他散发这一电文。他说：美国代表团这种行为，是要求他“违反过去已经牢牢确定的做法”，而他认为“没有理由违反既定的程序”。
    美国代表团这种无理取闹的行动，也在其他联合国人士中间引起了不满。美联社记者罗伯茨十六日报道说：美国所采取的这种态度，“已使得它自己被人怀疑是内心有疚的，特别在亚洲人心目中是如此”。这个记者还指出：美国的态度成了不少国家代表团纷纷议论的对象。有些代表认为，这是“近乎幼稚的作法”。其他一些代表则以讥讽的口气说，“这是由于在纽约和华盛顿的某些国务院人士缺乏外交训练”。
