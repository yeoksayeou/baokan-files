    Riding the train westward on the Tianshui-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway, one can see from the train window the newly built houses at the foot of the Gaolan Mountain, the rows of passenger cars, freight cars, and tank cars lined up at the station, the puffs of thick white smoke from the locomotives, and the dust stirred up by the trucks carrying goods. At this moment, a clear voice is broadcasted from the train's speakers: The terminal station of the Tianshui-Lanzhou section—Lanzhou East Station—has arrived!
    
    In fact, Lanzhou East Station is not only the terminal of the Tianshui-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway, but also the starting point of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. The future Baotou-Lanzhou Railway will also meet the Longhai Railway and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway here. Before the Tianshui-Lanzhou section was built, this place was a desolate cemetery, with only a few wisps of smoke occasionally seen rising from the cave dwellings. Now, tens of thousands of square meters of new houses have been built to the west of the station. To the north of the station, a wide road has been built, connecting it to the highways leading to Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Yinchuan. Hundreds of trucks, horse-drawn carts, and handcarts transport various goods to the railway station every day, and transport large quantities of goods away from the railway station. The large quantities of goods unloaded from the trains and transported from the highways are piled up in the squares near the station. There are export goods such as raisins from Xinjiang, wool from Qinghai, and medicinal materials from the Hexi Corridor; and there are also industrial products and building materials from Anshan, Shanghai, Wuhan, etc., which look like rolling hills from a distance.
    
    Walking into Lanzhou East Station is like walking into a huge goods exhibition hall. Here is the cargo yard of the trading company, there is the wool pile of the livestock company, the east side is a huge material warehouse supplying the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, and the west side is the cargo receiving station of the Yumen Mining Bureau. Many wooden boxes containing machinery and metal materials are marked with "Transported to Yumen Oilfield", "Transported to Xinjiang August 1st Iron and Steel Plant", etc., as well as equipment for the basic construction of Lanzhou Power Plant, Lanzhou Wool Textile Factory, and Jiuquan Flour Mill. A large number of heavy steel rails transported from Anshan Iron and Steel are piled up on the east side of the station. These steel rails will be laid on the roadbed of the Hexi Corridor of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in the future. The porters are busy loading and unloading a batch of building materials; horse-drawn carts and handcarts line up in a long row for transportation. Cao Peigui, director of the handling company's office, told me: "When the train first arrived in Lanzhou, the most cement it transported was only a few hundred bags, and it was rare to have a whole train; now it transports one or twenty cars at a time." When the Tianshui-Lanzhou section was first opened to traffic, the Lanzhou East Station's handling company office had only over one hundred porters, but now it has increased to over eight hundred and is still often too busy.
    
    Since the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou section, it has transported millions of tons of materials to various parts of the Northwest, of which about one million tons of road construction materials were transported westward through Lanzhou East Station. With the support of the railway's powerful transportation capacity, dozens of geological prospecting teams are exploring for oil, coal, and other underground resources in the vast areas of the Northwest; the Yumen Oilfield and the Aganzhen Coal Mine are stepping up construction; and new factories in Lanzhou, Urumqi, and other places are also being established one after another. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been laid for more than 200 kilometers into the Northwest. This winter, the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway will also begin to be built northeastward from Lanzhou. In the future, many factories and mines will be built in Gansu and Xinjiang. The transportation tasks of the Tianshui-Lanzhou section are becoming heavier day by day. The construction materials transported in the first four months of this year alone increased by more than 30% compared with the same period last year. The crude oil from the Yumen Oilfield transported eastward through Lanzhou East Station this year has also increased several times compared with last year. Although the equipment at Lanzhou East Station is increasing every year, there is still no place to stack the large quantities of materials pouring in. Even the Hongshangen Square, where the people of Lanzhou hold meetings, is sometimes filled with goods unloaded from trains. Now Lanzhou East Station is building a new freight yard, and other equipment will also be increased. The railway workers at the station are also carrying out a full-load and over-axle movement, striving to improve transportation efficiency.

    在兰州东站上
    新华社记者　郭汾祥
    乘着陇海铁路天兰段往西行的列车，快到兰州时，远远就可以从车窗中望见在皋兰山脚下的那片新盖的房屋，排列在站上的一列列的客车、货车和油槽车，从火车头里冒出的一股股浓白色的烟雾，来来往往的运货汽车卷起的漫天的尘土。这时，车厢广播器里传送出清脆的声音：天兰段的终点站——兰州东站到了！
    其实，兰州东站不单是陇海铁路天兰段的终点，也是兰新铁路的起点，未来的包兰铁路也在这儿和陇海铁路、兰新铁路碰头。天兰段修通前，这儿还是一片荒凉的坟地，偶而能见到几缕缭绕在窑洞上的炊烟。现在，车站的西面已经新建了几万平方公尺的房屋。车站的北面修筑了一条宽阔的马路，它和通向新疆、青海、陕西、银川等地的公路衔接起来。每天都有几百辆汽车、马车、手拉车川流不息地把各式各样货物集中到火车站来，又从火车站把大批货物运走。从火车上卸下的和从公路上运来的大宗货物，堆满在车站附近的广场上。有新疆来的葡萄干、青海的羊毛、河西走廊出产的药材等外运的物资；也有从鞍山、上海、武汉等地运来的工业品和建筑器材，远远看去像是一座座起伏的小山。
    走到兰州东站，很像走进了一座巨大的货物陈列馆。这里是贸易公司的货场，那里是畜产公司的羊毛堆，东边是供应修筑兰新铁路的巨大材料库，西边是玉门矿务局的货物接运站。好多装着机器和金属材料的木箱上写着“运往玉门油矿”、“运往新疆八一钢铁厂”等字样，还有供给兰州电厂、兰州毛纺织厂、酒泉面粉厂基本建设用的器材。车站东边堆着大批从鞍钢运来的重型钢轨，这些钢轨将来要铺设在兰新铁路河西走廊的路基上。搬运工人正在忙着起卸一批建筑器材；马车、手拉车排成长长的行列在运输。搬运公司办事处的主任曹培贵告诉我说：“火车刚到兰州时，运来的水泥最多不过几百袋，难得有整车的；现在一次就要运输一、二十个车皮。”天兰段刚通车时，兰州东站的搬运公司办事处只有一百多个搬运工人，现在增加到八百多人还时常忙不过来。
    天兰段通车以来已经为西北各地运输了几百万吨物资，其中通过兰州东站西运的筑路器材就有一百万吨左右。在铁路强大运输力的支援下，几十个地质钻探队正在西北广大地区勘探石油、煤和其他地下资源；玉门油矿、阿干镇煤矿正在加紧进行建设；兰州、乌鲁木齐等地的新工厂也在一座座建立起来。兰新铁路已经向西北铺设了二百多公里。今年冬季包（头）兰（州）铁路也将开始从兰州向东北修筑。甘肃、新疆各地今后还将建设许多工厂、矿山。天兰段的运输任务正在一天天繁重起来，仅今年头四个月运输的建设材料就比去年同期增加百分之三十以上。今年通过兰州东站东运的玉门油矿原油也比去年增加好几倍。虽然兰州东站的设备每年在增加，大量涌到的物资还是没有堆放的地方。甚至兰州市人民集会的红山根广场有时也堆满着火车卸下的货物。现在兰州东站正在新建一个货场，其他设备也要增加。车站铁路职工也在开展满载超轴运动，努力提高运输效率。
