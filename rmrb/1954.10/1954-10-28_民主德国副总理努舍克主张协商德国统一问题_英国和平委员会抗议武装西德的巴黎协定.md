　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 24th, TASS reported: "New Times" published an article by Otto Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union, discussing the agreements signed in Paris on the 23rd regarding the rearmament of West Germany.

　　Nuschke wrote: The position taken by West German Chancellor Adenauer in the Paris negotiations clearly violates the wishes of the vast majority of the German people. The results of the elections in the German Democratic Republic, among many other facts, prove this point.

　　Nuschke pointed out that the main purpose of the Paris negotiations was to remilitarize West Germany. The article emphasized that in order to peacefully resolve the German question, it is necessary to abandon the remilitarization of West Germany and strive for an agreement between the East and West on the issue of restoring German unity.

　　Xinhua News Agency, London, October 26th, TASS reported: The British Peace Committee issued a statement protesting the Paris Agreements on arming West Germany. The statement said that such agreements would not guarantee European security and German independence; on the contrary, they would lead to "the re-establishment of an army controlled by militarists and former Nazis."

　　The statement also pointed out that these agreements would increase British military spending and automatically involve it in any conflict that might be provoked by the new German army.

    民主德国副总理努舍克主张协商德国统一问题
    英国和平委员会抗议武装西德的巴黎协定
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社柏林二十四日讯：“新时报”刊载了德意志民主共和国副总理、基督教民主联盟主席奥托·努舍克的一篇文章，讲到二十三日在巴黎签订的关于重新武装西德的协定。
    努舍克写道：西德总理阿登纳在巴黎谈判中所采取的立场，显然违背了绝大多数德国人民的愿望。除了许多其他的事实以外，德意志民主共和国人民选举的结果也证明了这一点。
    努舍克指出，巴黎谈判的主要目的是使西德重新军国主义化。文章着重指出，为了和平解决德国问题，必须放弃西德重新军国主义化，争取东方和西方就恢复德国统一的问题达成协议。
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十六日讯：英国和平委员会发表声明，抗议关于武装西德的巴黎协定。声明说，这种协定不会保证欧洲安全和德国独立，相反，这会导致“重新建立由军国主义者和前纳粹分子控制的军队”。
    声明还指出，这些协定将使英国军事开支增加，并使它自动地卷入新的德国军队可能挑起的任何冲突。
