    The East China Agricultural Science Research Institute recently held a citrus fruit symposium in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, a famous citrus fruit producing area. Agricultural science experts, technicians, and cadres engaged in citrus fruit production from Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces participated in the meeting. The meeting exchanged information and experiences on citrus fruit production in various regions, and focused on studying citrus fruit cultivation management methods and pest and disease control issues. The meeting conducted detailed research on rational pruning, rational fertilization, overcoming alternate bearing (biennial bearing), and the techniques and measures for planting citrus trees on mountains. In terms of pest and disease control, in addition to exchanging local control experiences, the meeting decided to formulate a pest and disease control calendar to grasp the seasons when pests and diseases occur and carry out timely prevention and control. In order to improve production technology, increase the yield and quality of citrus fruits, and meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets, the meeting thoroughly studied the key to the current increase in citrus fruit production, and initially studied and proposed the East China region's 1955 citrus fruit experiment and research plan. During the meeting, the representatives visited the Huangyan Citrus Fruit Farm and the citrus fruit production of the Huangyan County "Advanced" Agricultural Production Cooperative.
