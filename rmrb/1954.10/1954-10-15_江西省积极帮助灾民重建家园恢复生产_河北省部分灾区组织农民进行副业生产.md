Jiangxi Province's water levels in the areas along the river and lakes are rapidly receding. In order to promptly help the disaster-stricken people rebuild their homes, repair dikes, and restore production, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a disaster area work conference to arrange for this winter and next spring to further organize farmers in disaster areas to engage in production for self-relief, complete dike repairs, properly resettle disaster victims, and focus on restoring agricultural production. Regarding the repair of dikes, it is required to universally restore and focus on heightening and reinforcing them, enhancing the quality and flood resistance of the dikes, and ensuring that they do not overflow or collapse under this year's water levels. Each county should formulate repair plans with a focus and in a step-by-step manner according to the damage to the dikes, striving to start construction in October and complete it around February or March next year. The conference also determined that the winter wheat planting area in the sixteen disaster-stricken counties should be expanded to more than 80% this year, mobilizing the masses to plant more wheat, rapeseed, and beans. In areas where the water recedes later, preparations should be made to rush-plant barley, vegetables, and spring-maturing crops to solve the people's food needs next spring. Under the premise of restoring agricultural production, it is also necessary to explore production potential in accordance with local conditions and lead the masses to develop sideline production in many ways. The conference made specific resolutions on the prices and sales of sideline products, as well as seeds for winter planting. (Our reporter station in Jiangxi)

Farmers in some areas of Hebei Province that have suffered from floods are actively developing sideline production.

Currently, the most active sideline productions in the disaster areas are fishing, spinning, and mat weaving. Fishing is in its peak season. On September 18, Anxin County produced more than 90,000 jin of fish in one day. In Baodi, Ba, Wen'an, Wuqing, Anci, Jinghai, and Dacheng counties, more than 44,900 people have been engaged in fishing, producing approximately more than 200,000 jin of fish per day. In areas with a foundation in spinning, spinning production has been launched. In Anxin, Gaoyang, Qingyuan, and other seven counties, 11,600 looms have been put into production. In order to save grain from multiple sources and overcome the disaster, many areas have launched a campaign to collect grass seeds, wild vegetables, and cut grass. According to statistics from nine counties in the Tianjin Special Zone and thirty-one districts in the Cang County and Tong County Special Zones, a total of more than 5.6 million jin of wild millet and wild vegetables have been collected, which can replace 2 million jin of grain; more than 33.8 million jin of grass have been cut, which can provide feed for 37,600 head of livestock for three months, strongly supporting wheat planting and next year's agricultural production.

The development of sideline production by farmers in the disaster areas has received strong support from the National Bank and supply and marketing cooperatives. The Hebei Branch of the People's Bank of China has focused on allocating more than 220 billion yuan in loans to the five severely affected special zones of Tianjin, Baoding, Cang County, Tong County, and Shijiazhuang. The Provincial Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has made a plan to purchase more than 1 trillion yuan worth of sideline, handicraft, local, and special products. The special and county supply and marketing cooperatives in the Tianjin Special Zone organized 192 cadres, hired 20 technicians, and established a special fishery promotion agency to solve the difficulty of fish product sales. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels have also supplied disaster victims with a large amount of grain and raw materials for sideline production, strongly supporting sideline production.

    河北省部分灾区组织农民进行副业生产
    江西省沿江滨湖地区水位迅速降落，为及时帮助灾区人民重建家园、修复圩堤和恢复生产，中共江西省委最近召开了灾区工作会议，布置今冬明春进一步组织灾区农民生产自救，完成修堤，做好灾民安置工作，抓紧恢复农业生产的任务。对修复圩堤，要求普遍恢复、重点加高加固，增强圩堤质量和抗洪能力，确保在今年水位情况下不漫溢、不溃决。各县应按照圩堤损坏情况，有重点有步骤地订出修复计划，争取十月动工，明年二三月前后完成。会议并确定灾区十六个县今年冬种面要扩大到百分之八十以上，发动群众多种小麦、油菜和豆类。水退较晚处，要准备抢种大麦、菜蔬和春熟作物，以解决群众明春口粮。在恢复农业生产的前提下，并要因地制宜地挖掘生产潜力，从多方面领导群众发展副业生产。对副业产品的价格、销路以及冬种的种籽，会议都作了具体的解决。（本报江西记者站）
    河北省部分遭受水灾地区农民，积极开展副业生产。
    当前灾区副业生产以捕鱼、纺织、织席为最活跃。捕鱼正在旺季。安新县九月十八日一天就产了九万多斤鱼。宝坻、霸县、文安、武清、安次、静海、大城七县投入捕鱼的已有四万四千九百多人，每天约产鱼二十多万斤。有纺织基础的地区，已开展起纺织生产。安新、高阳、清苑等七县，有一万一千六百架织布机投入生产。为从多方面节约粮食渡过灾荒，许多地区开展了打草籽、野菜和割草运动。据天津专区的九个县和沧县、通县两专区的三十一个区的统计，共采野稗子和野菜等五百六十多万斤，能代替二百万斤粮食；打草三千三百八十多万斤，可供三万七千六百头牲口三个月的饲料，有力地支持了种麦和明年的农业生产。
    灾区农民开展副业生产，得到了国家银行和供销合作社的有力支持。中国人民银行河北省分行已重点地分配天津、保定、沧县、通县、石家庄五个重灾专区贷款二千二百多亿元。省供销合作总社作出了收购副业、手工业、土产品、特产品总值一万多亿元的计划。天津专区专、县供销合作社组织了一百九十二名干部，聘请了二十名技术人员，建立了渔业专门推销机构，解决了鱼产销售的困难。各级供销合作社还供应了灾民大量粮食和副业生产的原料，有力地支持了副业生产。
