Xinhua News Agency, Alma-Ata, October 21st: According to a TASS report from Alma-Ata on the 21st, the design work for the railway line from Alma-Ata to the border of the People's Republic of China has begun. As everyone knows, according to the joint communiqué issued by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in Beijing not long ago, a new railway will be built from Lanzhou to Urumqi to Alma-Ata, with Alma-Ata, the capital of the Soviet Kazakh Republic, as the terminal.

Alma-Ata was established a hundred years ago and is now the political, economic, and cultural center of the Kazakh Republic. Before the establishment of the Soviet regime, it was a remote small town of Tsarist Russia with only 30,000 residents. But now, it is one of the most beautiful cities in the Soviet Union, with hundreds of thousands of residents. Machine manufacturing, light industry, food industry, and construction industry enterprises have been established here. The city is full of gardens and boulevards. Spacious and bright residences, schools, scientific and cultural institutions stand on both sides of the streets. Currently, Alma-Ata is building more than 600 residences, a multi-story building for the Kazakh Academy of Sciences, a Soviet Palace, a large cinema, and school buildings for higher and secondary specialized schools.

    从苏联阿拉木图到我国境铁路线开始设计
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社阿拉木图二十一日讯：自阿拉木图通达中华人民共和国边境的铁路线的设计工作已经开始了。大家知道，依照不久以前在北京发表的苏联和中华人民共和国的联合公报，将修建一条兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图新铁路，而苏联的哈萨克加盟共和国首都阿拉木图将是这条铁路的终点。
    阿拉木图城是在一百年以前建立的，它现在是哈萨克共和国政治、经济和文化中心。在苏维埃政权建立以前，它是沙皇俄国的一个偏僻的小城，居民只有三万人。但现在，它是苏联最美丽的城市之一，共有几十万居民。这里已建立了机器制造业、轻工业、食品工业和建筑工业的企业。城市里遍布花园和林荫道。各大小街道的两旁都耸立着宽敞明亮的住宅、学校、科学和文化机关。目前，阿拉木图正在建筑六百多所住宅，哈萨克科学院的多层楼房、一个苏维埃宫、一个大电影院，以及高等和中等专科学校的校舍。
