    Hunan Province farmers are striving to complete the rapeseed sowing plan.
    After widespread publicity and education on planned rapeseed production and the unified purchase of rapeseed, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers in Hunan for planting rapeseed has greatly increased. They are seizing the season to strive to complete the province's 4 million mu rapeseed sowing plan.
    As of the beginning of October, according to incomplete statistics from 55 counties in six special districts, including Shaoyang, Xiangtan, and Changde, approximately 2 million mu of rapeseed have been sown. In areas where double-cropping rice is planted, such as Liling County, farmers are working through the night to rush planting. Many places have also launched labor competitions. For example, after the launch of a production competition in the eighth district of Taojiang, more than 8,000 people and more than 700 cattle were mobilized on October 10 alone to rush plowing and planting. After the launch of a mobile red flag competition in the Yulan Township of the third district of Dongkou, the production enthusiasm of the masses was boosted. The entire township quickly increased from 400 people to more than 700 people, rushing to plant more than 400 mu of rapeseed. In areas on the shores of Dongting Lake where the water receded relatively late, the method of "plant one plot as soon as it recedes" and transplanting seedlings was adopted. Some places where there is not enough land have tried to convert winter paddy fields that have not been planted with crops for many years into winter planting fields. Farmers in the fourth district of Nanxian County also used intercropping rapeseed in broad bean fields. By September 17, the entire district had sown more than 1,000 mu.

    湖南省农民争取完成油菜播种计划
    湖南广大农民，经过关于油菜计划生产和菜籽统购的宣传教育后，一般农民种植油菜的积极性大为提高，他们正抓紧季节，为完成全省四百万亩油菜的播种计划而努力。
    截至十月上旬止，据邵阳、湘潭、常德等六个专区五十五个县的不完全统计，共已播种油菜二百万亩左右。醴陵等县种双季稻的地区，农民连夜赶种。许多地方还开展了劳动竞赛。如桃江八区开展生产竞赛后，十月十日一天就出动八千多人，七百多条牛，进行抢耕抢种。洞口三区毓兰乡开展流动红旗竞赛后，群众的生产情绪鼓舞起来了，全乡由四百人，马上增加到七百多人，赶种油菜四百多亩。在洞庭湖滨部分退水较迟的地区，则采取了“退一丘，种一丘”和寄苗移栽的办法。有些地方土地不够，就将多年不种作物的冬水田设法改为冬种田。南县四区农民还利用蚕豆地里间种油菜，到九月十七日止，全区已播种了一千多亩。
