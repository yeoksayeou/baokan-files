    Shanghai Suburbs Build an Artificial Rainfall Irrigation Station

    With the help of central and East China agricultural and water conservancy departments, and based on the advanced agricultural technology and scientific experience of the Soviet Union, the first artificial rainfall irrigation station in Tangnan Township, Dachang District, Shanghai suburbs, was built and successfully tested before National Day.

    The completion of this artificial rainfall irrigation station will enable 350 mu of land in the surrounding area to be irrigated year-round. Because artificial rainfall is timely and can fully meet the large amount of water needed by vegetables, it will promote faster vegetable growth; because machines replace human labor, it will greatly reduce the heavy physical labor of local farmers carrying water to water vegetables.

    The completion of the artificial rainfall irrigation station has made local farmers further recognize the beautiful prospects of a socialist society. Many mutual aid teams have requested to be converted into agricultural production cooperatives, and some individual farmers have also requested to join the cooperatives and take the road of collectivization.

    上海市郊兴建一座人工降雨灌溉站
    在中央和华东农林水利部门帮助下，根据苏联先进农业技术科学经验，上海市郊大场区塘南乡兴建第一座人工降雨灌溉站，并于国庆节前夕试行放水成功。
    这座人工降雨灌溉站的建成，可使周围三百五十市亩土地常年得到灌溉。由于人工降雨及时并能充分满足蔬菜所需要的大量水分，将促使蔬菜成长更加迅速；由于机器代替了人力，将大大减轻当地农民挑水浇菜的繁重体力劳动。
    人工降雨灌溉站的建成，使当地农民进一步认识了社会主义社会的美景。很多互助组要求转为农业生产合作社，有些单干农民也要求入社，走集体化的道路。
