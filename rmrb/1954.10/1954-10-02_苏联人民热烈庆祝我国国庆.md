    Soviet People Warmly Celebrate China's National Day

    The Soviet people warmly celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    Moscow newspapers prominently featured the news that the Soviet government delegation attending China's National Day ceremony had arrived in Beijing. This news, demonstrating the profound friendship between China and the Soviet Union, brought great excitement to the people.

    Moscow held numerous commemorative events in recent days. On the evening of the 30th, a grand meeting was held in the Hall of Columns of the Moscow Trade Union Building to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The meeting was jointly hosted by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Soviet Ministry of Culture, the Soviet Peace Committee, the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, the Soviet Writers' Union, and the Soviet Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge.

    Attending the celebration were advanced workers from industry and agriculture, government officials, social activists, writers, artists, and students, as well as diplomatic envoys from many countries to the Soviet Union and Chinese and Mongolian trade union delegations, Indian filmmakers, and a delegation from the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association who were visiting the Soviet Union.

    The presidium of the meeting consisted of Kaftanov, First Deputy Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union; Solovyov, Vice Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions; Zhang Wentian, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union; Gromyko, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union; Kuznetsov, Deputy Minister; Khrennikov, General Secretary of the Soviet Composers' Union, and others.

    Kaftanov delivered the opening address. He warmly congratulated the great Chinese people on their National Day and emphasized the growing cultural ties between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. Kaftanov concluded by shouting: "Long live the heroic Chinese people! Long live the eternal, unbreakable friendship and fraternal alliance between the Soviet and Chinese peoples!" The hall resounded with warm applause.

    Solovyov, Vice Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, delivered a report on "The Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China." In his report, he spoke in detail about the achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party in the development of industry, agriculture, and culture, as well as in consolidating the people's democratic system. He concluded by warmly congratulating the Chinese people on their National Day on behalf of the Soviet working people, wishing the great Chinese people new victories in socialist construction.

    Zhang Wentian, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union, spoke at the meeting. In his speech, he talked about the various achievements made by the People's China in the past five years and the great strength of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. His speech was warmly welcomed.

    A grand concert was then held, featuring works by Russian musicians and Soviet and Chinese composers.

    Throughout the Soviet Union, many urban and rural workers widely celebrated the fifth anniversary of the founding of the fraternal People's China. In Moscow, lectures on China were held at enterprises such as the Stalin Automobile Factory, the "Hammer and Sickle" Factory, the First Ball Bearing Factory, and the "Rubber" Factory. In Kiev, many factories, institutions, and schools conducted reports on the prosperity of the economy and culture of New China, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and other topics. In Tashkent, worker representatives held a grand evening party on the 29th, where Mukhitdinov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek Republic, delivered a report on the topic of "The Fifth Anniversary of the People's Republic of China." Soviet newspapers and periodicals devoted more and more space to commemorating the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. "Pravda" published a special edition on the 29th under the large headline "Soviet People Heartily Congratulate the Chinese People on Their Great Festival," and another special edition on the 30th under the large headline "The Chinese People Are Enthusiastically Building a New Life." The former special edition expressed the friendship of the Soviet people for the Chinese people, a friendship higher than mountains and deeper than the sea. The latter special edition selected the speeches of the delegates to the National People's Congress praising the bright, happy, and free life and the achievements of New China in the past five years. The fourteenth issue of "Kommunist" published Comrade Mao Zedong's opening address at the First Session of the First National People's Congress, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," and Avalin's article "The Great Chinese People Are Advancing Along the Socialist Road."

    Many cinemas, cultural palaces, and clubs in Moscow screened films such as "Liberated China," "The White-Haired Girl," "Children of the Storm," "The Victory of the Chinese People," "The Great Unity of the Chinese People," and "Daughters of China" on the 30th. In many bookstores in Moscow, readers purchased newly published books about China—separate volumes on China from the Soviet Encyclopedia, papers on the economic achievements of the People's Republic of China from 1949 to 1951, the reissued "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," Kozhevnikov's "People of New China," and more.
