The Chiang Kai-shek Clique's Ruthless Taxes and Levies Plunge Taiwanese People into Hunger and Starvation
Farmers Suffering from Drought Face Even More Miserable Lives
Taiwanese farmers suffering from a severe drought are facing even more hunger and starvation under the ruthless taxes and levies of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

According to Taiwanese newspapers, most parts of Taiwan have suffered the worst drought in sixty years this year. In the three northern counties of Taiwan, Miaoli, Hsinchu, and Taoyuan, which were the most severely affected, approximately 29,000 hectares of paddy fields could not be planted with the second crop of rice due to drought, and most of the rice that had already been sown has withered. The tea gardens, on which more than one million Taiwanese tea farmers depend for their livelihoods, as well as the important Taiwanese specialties of tangerines and sugar cane, have also generally suffered reduced production, and many tea trees and fruit trees have withered. In Baoshan Township, Hsinchu County, 80 percent of the tea trees, 50 percent of the tangerine trees, and most of the sugar cane have failed due to lack of water, and some have already died. More than 20,000 farmers in the township have fallen into a state of famine. In various parts of Taiwan, the crops that have survived the drought have recently suffered widespread outbreaks of pests and diseases. For example, more than 7,000 hectares of rice in Miaoli County have been affected by pests and diseases, and there is no hope of harvesting. Fish in many ponds in the disaster areas of Taiwan have died due to drought. Wells and streams in many townships have also dried up. Millions of residents in the disaster areas have to buy water to drink, and water prices are constantly rising. The price of one "dan" of water (approximately 50 kg) is now equivalent to six or seven "jin" of rice (approximately 3-3.5 kg) in some disaster areas. Simultaneously with the drought, diseases are rampant in the disaster areas.

The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's criminal rule is an important reason for aggravating the current drought in Taiwan. Taiwan relies entirely on forests to maintain water and soil, and without forests, water cannot be stored. However, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique not only fails to protect the public forests, which account for more than 90 percent of Taiwan's forest area, but also indiscriminately cuts down trees and steals and sells large quantities of timber. When reporting on the disaster in Tamsui District, Taipei County, Taiwanese newspapers admitted that the "main reason" for this severe drought was "excessive deforestation, which causes rainwater to drain away quickly during heavy rains, making it impossible to retain water sources."

Under the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, Taiwan's farmland water conservancy projects have fallen into disrepair, waterways are blocked, reservoirs are damaged, and irrigation systems are ineffective, all of which have exacerbated this year's drought in Taiwan. According to Taiwanese newspapers, the reservoirs in Hongmao, Hukou, and Shimen in Hsinchu County, which suffered severe damage, have not been cleared of silt for many years, and the bottom of the reservoirs is almost level with the ground. The Taoyuan Canal reservoir originally had a water storage capacity of 2 billion cubic meters, which could irrigate approximately 23,000 hectares of land. However, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique allowed it to fall into disrepair, causing the protective works of the weirs and reservoirs to peel and break down, greatly reducing the water storage capacity and causing a severe drought in the irrigation area of the Taoyuan Canal this year.

The lives of farmers in the disaster areas of Taiwan have fallen into a state of hunger and starvation, and in many areas, the victims are relying on collecting wild plants and grass roots to satisfy their hunger. However, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, disregarding the lives and deaths of the people, is deeply afraid that the severe drought will "affect the achievements of this period's collection," and is therefore stepping up the urging of donations and taxes in the disaster areas. According to Taiwanese newspapers, a large number of Chiang bandits' grain and tax collectors and Chiang bandits' military police are going from house to house in the Taiwanese countryside to urge the starving victims to pay land prices, land taxes, household taxes, and other new and old debts. The farmers in Taoyuan County, where even the bamboos have turned yellow due to the drought, have requested the Chiang bandit Taiwanese provincial government to provide a meager loan of 60 kilograms of rice seeds per hectare (equivalent to 8 "jin" per "mu") for next year's spring sowing, as they have no means to subsist and no grain for next year's spring sowing. However, the Chiang bandit Taiwanese provincial government instead ordered the puppet Taoyuan County government to send the director of the Civil Affairs Bureau and the chief of the Land Administration Section to go to the countryside together with the director of the puppet Land Bank office to supervise the collection of land prices, and instructed "all township offices to mobilize all manpower to assist in urging collection, so as to achieve the goal of full collection even under extremely difficult circumstances." This tyrannical measure is to extract 10.05 million kilograms of rice and 287,000 pseudo-Taiwan dollars in cash from the 16,000 impoverished and middle peasants in Taoyuan County who have "contracted cultivated land." On average, each farmer needs to pay 620 kilograms of rice and 16 pseudo-Taiwan dollars in cash for land prices.

People Are Forced by Chiang Bandits to Engage in Unpaid Hard Labor

The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique forces a large number of Taiwanese people to engage in unpaid labor to build construction projects and various other projects for the Chiang bandit army and Chiang bandit government agencies. According to Taiwanese newspapers, the puppet county and city governments of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique formulate so-called "National Obligatory Labor Plans" every year, forcing Taiwanese people aged 18 to 50 to do various kinds of hard labor. Currently, the puppet county and city governments in Taiwan are implementing this year's (from July this year to June next year) forced labor plans, and a large number of Taiwanese men and women are being forced to do various kinds of hard labor. The victims in the drought-stricken areas have not been exempted from forced labor. More than 330,000 of the 640,000 residents of Tainan County will be forced to build military construction projects. The puppet Nantou County government will requisition 600,000 labor days from farmers this year, forcing them not only to build military bases and roads but also to reclaim 26 hectares of "public wasteland" for the Chiang bandits and do other hard labor. The residents of Wulai Township, Taipei County, are currently suffering from hunger and starvation due to the drought, but are still being forced to build an auditorium with unpaid labor.

Dockworkers' Income Cannot Sustain Their Lives

Under the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the lives of Taiwanese dockworkers are very difficult.

According to Taiwanese newspapers, the 2,600 dockworkers in Keelung Port each earn more than 400 pseudo-Taiwan dollars per month, while they need at least 750 pseudo-Taiwan dollars per month to maintain the minimum standard of living for their families (calculated as five people). Therefore, dockworkers work overtime at night after strenuous labor during the day to earn wages to subsidize their living expenses. Taiwanese newspapers reported that despite the dockworkers' tireless labor day and night, their monthly income is still difficult to sustain their lives. Due to malnutrition and overwork, many dockworkers are sick. Twenty percent of the dockworkers in Keelung Port suffer from lung disease. The lives of dockworkers in Kaohsiung and Hualien Ports are also similarly difficult. The wages currently received by dockworkers in various places are still the "base figures approved" by the Chiang bandit transportation department in 1950, while the price index in Taiwan under the rule of the Chiang bandits has risen threefold in recent years, "living expenses have soared, but wages have not been adjusted," and the lives of Taiwanese dockworkers are in a very difficult state. Dockworkers in various places have repeatedly requested wage increases, but they have been unreasonably rejected by the Chiang bandit authorities.

Taiwanese newspapers also revealed that safety facilities at Taiwanese docks are extremely poor, and injuries occur frequently. In the upper and middle of September, poisoning incidents occurred several times in Keelung Port. In one incident, 48 dockworkers were poisoned while handling chemical pigments, and 21 of them were severely poisoned.

    蒋介石卖国集团横征暴敛
    台湾人民陷入饥渴交迫的境地
    遭受旱灾的农民生活更加悲惨
    遭受严重旱灾的台湾农民，在蒋介石卖国集团横征暴敛下，生活已更加陷入饥渴交迫的境地。
    据台湾报纸报道，今年台湾大部地区遭受了六十年来未有的严重旱灾。在灾情最严重的台湾北部苗栗、新竹、桃园三县，共约有二万九千公顷稻田因干旱不能种植二期稻，已播种的稻也大部枯萎。台湾一百多万茶农赖以为生的茶树园，以及台湾重要特产柑桔和甘蔗也都普遍减产，许多茶树和果树都已枯萎。在新竹县宝山乡，百分之八十的茶树、百分之五十的柑桔树和大部分甘蔗，都因缺水失收，其中有一些已经枯死，全乡二万多农民已陷入饥馑状态。台湾各地在旱灾中幸免枯死的农作物，最近又普遍发生病虫害。如苗栗县有七千多公顷水稻受病虫害，收成无望。台湾灾区许多池塘的鱼类都因旱浮毙。不少乡镇的水井和溪流也都干涸。灾区千千万万居民都要买水饮用，而且水价不断高涨，现在有些灾区一担水的价格等于大米六、七市斤。与旱灾同时，疾病在灾区猖獗流行。
    蒋介石卖国集团的罪恶统治，是加重台湾这次旱灾的重要原因。台湾全靠森林保持水土，无森林就不能蓄水。但蒋介石卖国集团对占台湾森林面积百分之九十以上的公有林，不但不加保护，反而滥行砍伐，大量盗卖木材。台湾报纸在报道台北县淡水区的灾情时，承认这次严重旱灾的造成，“最主要原因乃为森林被砍伐过度，每逢大雨，雨水即倾泻干尽，无法保留水源”。
    在蒋介石卖国集团黑暗统治下，台湾农田水利失修，水道堵塞，水库毁坏，灌溉系统失效，也都加重了今年台湾的旱灾。据台湾报纸报道，灾情惨重的新竹县红毛、湖口、石门等地的各个蓄水池，因多年没有清除泥沙，池底几乎已和地面齐平。桃园大圳蓄水池原有蓄水能力二十亿立方公尺，约可灌溉二万三千公顷土地。但蒋介石卖国集团任其自生自灭，使堰堤和水库的保护工程都剥落破烂，大大减低蓄水能力，造成了今年桃园大圳灌溉区内的严重旱灾。
    台湾灾区农民的生活已陷于饥渴交迫的境地，许多地区的灾民靠采集野生植物和草根充饥。但是不顾人民死活的蒋介石卖国集团，却深恐严重旱灾“影响本期征收成绩”，因而加紧在灾区催捐征税。据台湾报纸报道，大批蒋贼征粮征税人员和蒋贼军警，在台湾农村中挨家逐户向在饥饿中的灾民催征地价、田赋、户税等等新捐旧欠。连竹子也因旱枯黄的桃园县农民，因目前的生活和明年春播的谷种都没有着落，曾向蒋贼台湾省政府提出贷放明年春播谷种每公顷六十公斤（合每市亩贷八市斤）的低微要求。但蒋贼台湾省政府反而命令伪桃园县政府派出民政局长、地政科长会同伪土地银行办事处主任下乡督征地价，并指使“各乡镇公所动员所有人力协助催征，务期在极端困难的情形下，仍能达到满征目的”。这一横暴措施，即是要从桃园县一万六千多户“承领耕地”的贫农和中农身上，榨出地价一千零五十万公斤稻谷和现金二十八万七千元伪台币。平均每一农户约需缴纳地价六百二十公斤稻谷和现金十六元伪台币。
    人民被蒋贼强迫从事无偿苦役
    蒋介石卖国集团强迫大批台湾人民从事无偿劳役，替蒋贼军和蒋贼政府机关修筑工事和各种工程。据台湾报纸报道，蒋介石卖国集团的伪县、市政府每年都订出所谓“国民义务劳动计划”，强征十八岁到五十岁的台湾人民做各种苦工。目前台湾各伪县、市政府正在执行本年度（从今年七月到明年六月）强迫劳役计划，大批台湾男女被强征作各种苦工，各旱灾地区的灾民也未减免苦役。台南县六十四万居民中有三十三万多人将被驱逼修筑军事工事。伪南投县政府本年度内征用农民六十万工，除了强迫他们开辟军事基地、道路外，还强迫他们替蒋贼开垦“公有荒地”二十六公顷和做其他苦役。台北县乌来乡的居民正因旱灾陷于饥渴交迫中，但仍被迫以无偿劳役修建一幢礼堂。
    码头工人的收入不能维持生活
    在蒋介石卖国集团黑暗统治下，台湾码头工人生活十分困苦。
    据台湾报纸报道，基隆港二千六百多名码头工人每人每月收入四百多元伪台币，而他们每人每月至少需要七百五十元伪台币，才能维持全家人（以五口人计算）最低限度的生活。因此码头工人在白天强度劳动之后，又在夜间加班劳动，换取工资补贴生活费用。台湾报纸报道，尽管码头工人不分日夜地劳动，但他们每人每月的收入仍难维持生活。码头工人由于营养不足，操劳过度，患病者极多。基隆港码头工人就有百分之二十患肺病。高雄、花莲港的码头工人，生活也同样困苦。各地码头工人现在所领的工资，还是一九五零年蒋贼交通部门“核定的基数”，而几年来蒋贼统治下的台湾的物价指数已上涨三倍，“生活费用激增，而工资未调整”，台湾码头工人生活已处于十分困苦的状态。各地码头工人曾多次要求增加工资，但都遭到了蒋贼当局的无理拒绝。
    台湾报纸还透露，台湾码头安全设施极坏，经常发生伤人事件。基隆港在九月上中旬曾连次发生码头工人中毒事件，有一次码头工人在搬运化学颜料时有四十八人中毒，内二十一人中毒深重。
