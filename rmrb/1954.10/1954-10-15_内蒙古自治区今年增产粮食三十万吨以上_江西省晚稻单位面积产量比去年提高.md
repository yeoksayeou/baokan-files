Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, October 13th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is pleased to announce a bumper harvest of over 51 million mu of autumn crops, having exceeded the plan to increase grain production by 300,000 tons compared to last year. Currently, most of the crops in the autonomous region have been harvested. Farmers of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnicities are carefully harvesting to strive for even greater grain production to support national construction and the liberation of Taiwan. This year, due to attention being paid to harvesting, transportation, threshing, and gleaning, the average yield per mu is expected to increase by three to four jin. In areas where yields were not as high as expected in the past due to careless autumn harvesting, yields are expected to increase by about ten jin per mu this year. Before the autumn harvest, the Party and government organs of the Pingdiquan Administrative Region dispatched work teams to go deep into the villages to help farmers launch a mass movement for exceeding production targets. Due to careful harvesting, the 15 million mu of autumn crops in this region are estimated to increase production by more than 60 million jin of grain.

The autonomous region's bumper agricultural harvest this year is due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, improvements in cultivation techniques, and assistance from the state in various aspects. The vast majority of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the region have achieved bumper harvests this year, and many mutual aid teams have been consolidated and developed due to the bumper harvests. In the first half of this year, the state provided loans of more than 62,000 pieces of farm implements and more than 1,400 waterwheels to farmers of various ethnic groups. The region also newly built and repaired more than 2,100 large and small canals and dug more than 2,000 wells, enabling large areas of land to be irrigated. In addition, farmers of various ethnic groups have placed greater emphasis on and carried out close planting, diligent weeding, and fertilization this year, resulting in robust crop growth. Currently, farmers of various ethnic groups are enthusiastically carrying out autumn plowing, autumn collection, and seed selection in conjunction with threshing, striving for an even greater harvest next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, October 12th: Jiangxi Province's more than 15 million mu of late rice has begun to be harvested successively from south to north. In some areas of the south, about 40 percent has already been harvested.

The planting area of late rice in Jiangxi Province this year has been expanded by nearly one million mu compared to last year, which alone can increase rice production by more than 200 million jin compared to last year. The yield per unit area of late rice this year is also generally higher than last year. According to estimates by the leading organs of Nanfeng County, the county's late rice can increase production by 7 to 10 percent compared to last year. The Datang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linchuan County has already harvested 58 mu of single-season late rice, with an average yield of 450 jin per mu, an increase of 28 percent compared to last year. Farmers in various places are also paying attention to careful harvesting and threshing in the harvest of late rice to increase the amount of grain harvested.

    内蒙古自治区今年增产粮食三十万吨以上
    江西省晚稻单位面积产量比去年提高
    【新华社呼和浩特十三日电】内蒙古自治区五千一百多万亩秋季作物喜告丰收，全区已超额完成了比去年增产粮食三十万吨的计划。现在，自治区大部分庄禾已收割完毕，蒙、汉等族农民正精收细打，争取增产更多粮食支援祖国建设和解放台湾。今年各地因注意做好收割、拉运、碾打和拾穗等工作，平均每亩可多收三、四斤粮食，过去因秋收粗放而造成丰产不丰收的地方，今年每亩大约可以多收十斤左右。平地泉行政区党政机关在秋收前便派出工作组，深入农村帮助农民开展群众性的超额增产运动。这个地区一千五百多万亩秋季作物由于精收细打，估计可增产六千多万斤粮食。
    自治区今年农业丰收，是由于互助合作运动的发展，耕作技术的改进和国家各方面的扶助。全区的农业生产互助合作组织，今年绝大多数都获得了丰收，许多互助组也因丰收得到巩固和发展。今年上半年，国家向各族农民贷放了六万二千多件农具和一千四百多台水车，全区还新修和整修大小渠道二千一百多道，打井二千多眼，使大片土地得到了灌浇。另外，各族农民今年更普遍重视和进行了密植、勤锄和施肥工作，使作物生长茁壮。现在，各族农民正结合打场，热情地进行秋耕、秋汇和选种工作，争取明年更大丰收。
    【新华社南昌十二日电】江西省一千五百多万亩晚稻已从南到北陆续开始收割。南部地区有些地方已经收割了百分之四十左右。
    江西省今年晚稻的种植面积比去年扩大了将近一百万亩，仅这一项就可以比去年增产两亿多斤稻谷。今年晚稻的单位面积产量一般也比去年高。据南丰县领导机关估计，这个县的晚稻可比去年增产百分之七到百分之十。临川县大塘农业生产合作社已经收割的五十八亩单季晚稻，每亩平均产量达四百五十斤，比去年增产百分之二十八。各地农民在收割晚稻中还注意细收细打，提高粮食收获量。
