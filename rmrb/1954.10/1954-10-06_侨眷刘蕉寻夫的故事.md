    The Story of Overseas Chinese Dependent Liu Jiao Seeking Her Husband
    Chen Xiquan
    This is a story full of joys and sorrows, one of many similar stories since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The story takes place in Guangdong.
    Liu Jiao, an overseas Chinese dependent, lived in Xinguang Village, Zhanglin Township, Chenghai County. Liu Jiao married Chi Jianghan when she was twenty-one years old. Four months after their marriage, her husband, like many overseas Chinese, could not endure the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and was forced to go abroad to make a living. This young couple separated just like that. Chi Jianghan left for seven years, and Liu Jiao finally waited for him to return. However, the suffering that the Kuomintang reactionary rule inflicted on returned overseas Chinese forced Chi Jianghan to leave overseas again before their first child was born.
    Chi Jianghan left his hometown for an even longer time the second time, sixteen years. Liu Jiao waited from spring to autumn, and from autumn to spring; the trees in front of the village lost their leaves and sprouted again, and the flowers withered and bloomed again; the child was born and grew so tall, but she still couldn't wait for her husband to return and reunite.
    After Chi Jianghan went abroad, he sent some money back in the first few years. Liu Jiao, her mother-in-law, and her child were barely able to make a living. Later, Chi Jianghan became unemployed abroad and no longer sent money back. Therefore, the situation of the family of three became increasingly difficult. Liu Jiao thought in her heart: As long as my husband is safe and sound, it doesn't matter if he doesn't send money back. Who knew that after the Japanese invaders occupied Chaoshan, even news was cut off. From then on, she felt even heavier, emptier, and more茫茫. Under the torture of long-term worry and poverty, it was as if a large stone was pressing on her heart, and people rarely saw a smile on her face.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, a glimmer of hope revived in her heart, and she tried every means to find news of her husband. In despair, her younger brother sent a letter from abroad, telling her that Chi Jianghan was still alive. In this way, she looked forward to it again. However, year after year passed, and she still didn't receive a single word from her husband, and the news she missed in her heart disappeared again. She sometimes thought blankly: Maybe my younger brother deliberately concealed the unfortunate news about her husband.... She lived her life in such a sullen mood all day long.
    After the liberation of Chaoshan, and after land reform, Liu Jiao, like many peasants, turned over.
      In May 1952, the overseas Chinese dependents in Xinguang Village wrote letters to Chairman Mao one after another, reporting the joy of turning over. In her joy, Liu Jiao thought of her husband again. She knew that Chairman Mao cared about the people, so in her letter to Chairman Mao, in addition to reporting how her family's life had gradually improved after liberation, she also added a sentence: hoping to get news of her husband who lived overseas in a certain place. This letter carried her earnest expectation of finding her husband, who had been missing for more than ten years. But she just expected it and didn't think it would really come true. Unexpectedly, her expectation turned into reality because of this letter. After Chairman Mao received her letter, he instructed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government to handle it. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government then transferred to foreign countries through overseas Chinese affairs agencies to find her for a long time, and finally found Chi Jianghan's whereabouts.
    It was in 1952, when the autumn wind blew to Xinguang Village, that the warmth of spring came to Liu Jiao's home. One morning, Liu Jiao got up to cook, and suddenly heard someone knocking on the door outside. She ran out to see that it was a messenger who brought a letter from her husband and a remittance of 300,000 yuan. She was stunned. She wondered if this was a dream or if her eyes were deceiving her? But looking at the letter over and over again, Chi Jianghan's name was clearly and plainly written on the envelope! She ran back into the house with the letter and the remittance with her trembling hands and told her mother-in-law. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law faced the letter and money sent back by Chi Jianghan, and both shed tears. These tears contained the loving mother's love for her son, the wife's love for her husband, and also the great Chairman Mao's love for the people and the people's love for Chairman Mao. They immediately replied to the letter and sent the child's photo together. That was something that Chi Jianghan had never seen before. From that day on, this long-depressed family became vibrant.

    侨眷刘蕉寻夫的故事
    陈锡全
    这是一个充满着悲欢离合的故事，是中华人民共和国成立以后许许多多同样故事中的一个。故事发生在广东。
    澄海县樟林乡新光村住着一个华侨眷属，名叫刘蕉。刘蕉二十一岁时和池江涵结婚。婚后四个月，她的丈夫和许多出国的华侨一样，忍受不了国民党反动统治的压迫和剥削，被迫出国谋生。这一对年纪轻轻的夫妻，就这样离别了。池江涵一去就是七年，刘蕉好容易盼得他回来了。但是国民党反动统治所给予归侨的痛苦，迫使池江涵等不到他们的第一个孩子生下来，又匆匆地远涉重洋了。
    池江涵第二次离开家乡的时间更长久，一去就是十六年。刘蕉从春望到秋，从秋望到春；村前的树木，叶落了又重新发芽，花谢了又再开；孩子生下来，个子长得那么高大了，可是总盼不到丈夫回来团聚。
    池江涵到国外后，最初的几年，还寄了些钱回来。刘蕉和她的婆婆、孩子的生活，还勉强过得去。后来，池江涵在外失业，再也没有钱寄回来。因此，一家三口人的境况就愈来愈苦。刘蕉心里想：只要丈夫平平安安，没有钱寄回来倒是小事。那知日寇侵占潮汕后，连音讯也断绝了。从此她更觉得沉重、空虚、渺茫。在长期的忧虑和贫困生活的折磨下，她心上好像压上一块大石头，人们很难得看见她脸上有笑容。
    抗战胜利后，一丝希望又在她心里复苏了，她想尽办法找寻丈夫的讯息。在绝望中，她的弟弟从国外来了封信，告诉她池江涵还活在人间。这样，她又重新期待着。可是一年又一年的过去了，仍然接不到丈夫的片纸只字，心上所思念的音讯又石沉大海了。她有时这样呆想：也许弟弟有意瞒住丈夫的不幸消息……。她就这样整天闷闷不乐地生活着。
    潮汕解放后，又经过了土地改革，刘蕉和许多农民一样翻了身。
      一九五二年五月，新光村的侨眷们纷纷写信给毛主席，报告翻身的喜悦。刘蕉在喜悦中又想起了她的丈夫，她知道毛主席关心人民，她就在给毛主席的信中，除了报告解放后她全家生活如何得到逐步改善外，还带了一节话：希望能得到旅居国外某地的丈夫的音讯。这一封信寄托着她寻找十几年杳无音讯的丈夫的殷切期望。但她只是期望而已，并不以为真能实现。想不到，她的期望竟因这一封信而变成了现实。毛主席在接到她的信以后，就指示中央人民政府华侨事务委员会办理。中央人民政府华侨事务委员会又通过侨务机构，向国外辗转为她查访了许久，结果终于找到了池江涵的下落。
    就在一九五二年，秋风吹到了新光村的时候，春天的温暖到了刘蕉的家。那是一个早上，刘蕉刚起来弄饭，忽然听见外面有人叫门，她跑出去看，原来是一个送信的人，送来了她丈夫的信，还有三十万元汇款。她楞住了，她怀疑这是梦幻，还是眼睛看错了？但是把送来的信翻来覆去的看，信封上清清楚楚的、明明白白的写着池江涵的名字呀！她发抖的双手拿着信和汇款跑回屋里告诉她的婆婆。婆媳两人面对着池江涵寄回来的信和钱，都掉下泪来。这眼泪蕴藏着慈母对儿子的爱，妻子对丈夫的爱，也蕴藏着伟大的毛主席对人民的爱和人民对毛主席的爱。她们立刻复了信，并且把孩子的照片也一并寄去。那是池江涵从未见过面的。从那一天起，这个长期忧郁的家庭变得生气勃勃了。
