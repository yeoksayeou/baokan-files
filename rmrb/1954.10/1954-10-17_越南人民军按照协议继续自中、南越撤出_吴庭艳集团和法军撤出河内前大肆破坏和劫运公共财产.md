(Xinhua News Agency, October 14th) According to the Vietnam News Agency: Simultaneously with the Vietnamese People's Army's entry into Hanoi, the People's Army stationed in the northern part of Quang Ngai province in the Fifth Interzone of Central Vietnam, in accordance with the agreement between the two sides, withdrew to the south bank of the Tra Bong River on October 9th. The next day, the People's Army withdrew from Quang Ngai city and gathered south of the Tra Khuc River.

Administrative power in the withdrawn areas has been handed over to the other side. A handover ceremony was held in Quang Ngai city on October 11th.

(Xinhua News Agency, October 14th) According to the Vietnam News Agency on October 13th: The Vietnamese People's Army has completed its concentration work from the Ham Tan-Ca Mau temporary stationing area in South Vietnam to the north of the 17th parallel ahead of schedule. The People's Army units that withdrew northward overcame many difficulties in long sea voyages and all arrived at Cen Shan in northern Central Vietnam.

This transfer work began on September 21st and was completed on October 7th, three days earlier than the date stipulated by the Geneva Accords for this area.

At the same time, the People's Army units in the Dong Thap Muoi temporary stationing area in South Vietnam are also actively preparing to withdraw northward. Some units have already left Dong Thap Muoi on October 6th and 7th to come to Cen Shan.

(Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, October 13th) Before withdrawing from Hanoi, the Ngo Dinh Diem government and the French army, in violation of the provisions of the armistice agreement, extensively sabotaged and looted public property. Many public institutions and enterprises in Hanoi have therefore fallen into a state of incompleteness. Inside some buildings, there are broken vehicles everywhere, broken glass, sofas pierced by bayonets, and damaged furniture. In many office buildings, only empty floors and wires without light bulbs or lampshades remain.

Of the twenty-five cars, large and small, of the former Northern Vietnamese Chief of Staff's Office, only the rotten shells of three small cars remained, forty-eight of the one hundred and ten electric fans were left, and only six of the eighty-five typewriters were left, and twenty-one of the twenty-four sets of sofas were moved away. All archives and materials were taken away. The former French Governor-General's Palace was left with only one bed and a broken car, the elevator cables had been cut, and the glass windows had been broken. The indoor equipment of the former High Commissioner's Office of Indochina, the Prime Minister's Office, the Northern Vietnam News Agency, and the residences of French and Bao Dai army officers were all moved away, and even the water pipes and electric wires were removed.

In addition, the equipment of many officially operated enterprises was also extensively destroyed and removed. The post and telecommunications bureau machine factory, with a construction area of 7,200 square meters, has been paralyzed. From the time the Geneva Accords were signed until September 10, Bao Dai government personnel and armed forces continuously looted equipment from the factory. Thirty lathes have been moved away, leaving only four foundation bolts in the position of each lathe. The electrical equipment of the remaining ten lathes was completely destroyed. Most of the inventory was taken away, including 1,000 tons of copper wire for long-distance cables alone. Many typewriters, teleprinters, telephone switchboards, and other machines from the post and telecommunications bureau were also taken away. All seven large transmitters of the "radio transmitting station" in the western district of the city were taken away. The state printing bureau, which belonged to the former Northern Vietnam News Agency, was ransacked, leaving not a single piece of type.

Thousands of boxes of medicines and instruments from Bach Mai Hospital, Phu Doan Hospital, and the Central Pharmacy were looted. Much of the teaching equipment from Hanoi University, Trung Vuong Girls' High School, and other schools was also taken away. Many schools have been so devastated by the French army and puppet army that they have not been able to start school after the summer vacation.

    撤出地区的行政权已移交给对方。十月十一日曾在广义城举行了移交仪式。
    【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社十三日讯：越南人民军已提前完成了从南越咸津—川木临时驻扎地段向十七度线以北地区集结的工作。北撤的人民军部队克服了许多海上长途旅行的困难，全部到达中越北部的岑山。
    这一转移工作在九月二十一日开始，到十月七日完成，比日内瓦协定为这个地区所规定的日期早三天。
    同时，在南越同塔梅临时驻扎地段的人民军部队也在积极准备北撤。若干部队并已在十月六日和七日离开同塔梅前来岑山。
    【新华社北越十三日电】吴庭艳政府和法军在撤出河内以前，违反停战协定的规定，大肆破坏和劫运公共财产。河内市许多公共机关和企业已因此陷于残缺不全的状况。在一些建筑物里面，到处是破烂的车辆，破碎的玻璃，被刺刀戳破的沙发和毁坏了的家具。在许多机关大楼内，只剩下空荡荡的地板和没有灯泡、灯罩的电线。
    前北越首宪府的二十五辆大小汽车只剩下三个小汽车的烂壳子，一百一十台电扇剩下四十八台，八十五部打字机只留下六部，二十四套沙发搬走了二十一套。档案和资料全部被运走。前法国总督府只剩下一张床和一部坏汽车，电梯的吊缆已被割断，玻璃窗也被打破。前印度支那高级专员府、总理府、北越新闻处以及法国和保大军队的军官住所，室内设备都被搬运一空，连自来水管和电灯线都被拆走。
    此外，许多官方经营的企业设备也被大批破坏和运走。建筑面积达七千二百平方公尺的邮电局机器厂已陷于瘫痪。从日内瓦协定签订时起到九月十日为止，保大政府人员和武装部队不断劫运厂内设备。三十部车床已被运走，每部车床的位置上只留下四根地脚钉。剩下的十部车床的电力设备完全被破坏。库存物资绝大部分被运走，其中单是长途电线的铜线就有一千吨。邮电局的打字收发报机、电话交换机和其他机器也被运走许多部。城西区的“无线电发报台”七部大发报机全被运走。属于前北越新闻处的国家印刷局被洗劫得连一颗铅字也不剩。
    白梅医院、府尹医院、中央药院的成千箱的药品和仪器都被劫走。河内大学、徵王女中等学校的许多教学设备也被运走。许多学校由于遭到法军和伪军的蹂躏而破烂不堪，以至暑假过后一直还未能开学。
