    Chinese Folk and Classical Music Touring Troupe Established
    The Chinese Folk and Classical Music Touring Troupe, under the leadership of the Chinese Musicians Association, was officially established in Beijing on the 27th. This troupe includes four sections: folk chorus, folk music, classical music, and folk storytelling. Participants in the troupe include classical musicians Zha Fuxi, Jiang Fengzhi, and Guan Pinghu, as well as folk artists Feng Zicun and Zhao Chunting, who participated in the First National Folk Music and Dance Performance Convention, totaling more than 50 people. Shu Mo, a director of the Chinese Musicians Association, serves as the head of the troupe.
    The mission of the Chinese Folk and Classical Music Touring Troupe is to tour major cities, introducing excellent folk music and classical music, arousing attention to folk music and classical music in various regions, and promoting its development. In addition to performing, the troupe will also exchange experiences and learn from each other with music workers in various regions. The repertoire that the troupe plans to perform in various places includes the "Guangling San" for the seven-stringed zither, the Shandong Qinshu "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," and the Shaanxi folk song chorus "Thirty Li Pu," among other wonderful programs.
    The Chinese Folk and Classical Music Touring Troupe will depart in early November to perform in cities such as Shenyang, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Xi'an. The Chinese Musicians Association held a farewell reception for them on the 27th, on the occasion of the troupe's establishment. (Xinhua News Agency)
