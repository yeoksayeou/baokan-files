Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 26th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 25th to continue discussing the issue of reducing armaments and prohibiting weapons of mass destruction. Soviet representative Vyshinsky delivered a detailed speech at the meeting, explaining the Soviet Union's position on this issue.

Vyshinsky said that the attitudes of both the Soviet Union and Western countries have now become closer on this issue. This is demonstrated by the Soviet government's willingness to use the Franco-British proposal of June 11, 1954, as the basis for concluding an international convention on this issue. This also clarifies the significant fact that the proposal originally submitted to the committee by the Canadian delegation has now become a joint proposal of the delegations of Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky pointed out that this is something that even some representatives who are trying their best to make pessimistic propaganda cannot deny.

Vyshinsky pointed out that in the past, there were significant differences between the Soviet Union and Western countries, such as on the important principle of the stages of disarmament, but these differences have now been eliminated. On the one hand, Western countries have adopted the principle of disarmament that the Soviet Union has insisted on from the beginning; on the other hand, the Soviet proposal also takes into account the Franco-British recommendations on reducing conventional armaments and armed forces in two stages.

Referring to the question often mentioned in the debate about the level from which disarmament and reduction of armed forces should begin, Vyshinsky said that the Soviet plan, like the Franco-British memorandum, suggests using the amount of armaments and armed forces of each country as of December 31, 1953, as the level to begin implementing disarmament and reduction of armed forces. It can be seen that on this issue, the attitude of the Soviet Union on the one hand and France and the United Kingdom on the other hand is consistent.

Vyshinsky then talked about the main points of the Soviet proposal on the establishment of a supervisory body, saying that according to the Soviet proposal, the task of the temporary supervisory committee is to supervise the fulfillment of the obligations of various countries to reduce conventional armaments and armed forces. In the second stage, which stipulates the implementation of various measures to prohibit atomic weapons, a permanent supervisory body should be established.

Vyshinsky drew the attention of the Political Committee to the Soviet government's proposal on the first stage of disarmament: stipulating that the amount of arms reduction be 50% of the amount agreed upon by all parties and stipulating the establishment of a temporary supervisory committee. The Soviet government put forward this proposal to bring the attitudes of the Soviet Union and Western countries closer.

Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union still believes that an agreement among all countries to unconditionally renounce the use of atomic weapons would play an extremely important role in promoting and accelerating the implementation of the measures in the convention proposed by the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union does not advocate waiting for an agreement on the issue of all countries unconditionally renouncing the use of atomic weapons before implementing the plan in the Soviet proposal.

Vyshinsky also talked about when the permanent international supervisory body should start working, saying that if Western countries agree that this body should also start working when the various measures on reducing conventional armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction begin to be implemented, then there will be no difficulty in this regard.

Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union advocates that before concluding a unified international convention to implement the plan for disarmament and prohibiting atomic weapons, an agreement should be reached on the functions and powers of the supervisory body as part of this international convention.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the so-called "working paper" put forward by the United States on May 25, 1954, is unacceptable because it includes some clauses that have nothing in common with the task of supervision. For example, this document advocates giving the supervisory body punitive functions, giving the supervisory body rights and powers that should belong to the Security Council, which violates the United Nations Charter. This "working paper" is formulated based on the basic principles of the "Baruch Plan," which has long been discredited and aims to enable the United States to gain atomic control.

Vyshinsky finally said that he believes it is necessary to remind again that some of the measures stipulated in the Soviet proposal are of great significance, and in order to make it more likely to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament and prohibiting atomic weapons, this convention is based on the Franco-British proposal. Vyshinsky said, I think it is appropriate for all of us to pay attention to those issues where the current attitude of the Soviet Union and the attitude of Western countries are already close. In order to make it more likely to reach an agreement on this issue, the Soviet Union hopes that Western countries can also make corresponding efforts.

    联大政委会继续举行会议讨论裁军问题
    维辛斯基详细说明苏联的立场
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：联合国大会政治委员会二十五日举行会议，继续讨论裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器问题。苏联代表维辛斯基在会上发表了详细的演说，说明苏联关于这个问题的立场。
    维辛斯基说，在这个问题上，苏联和西方国家双方的态度现在已经取得接近。这表现在：苏联政府表示愿意以一九五四年六月十一日的法英建议作为就这个问题缔结国际公约的基础。这也使下述的重大情况得到了说明，这个情况就是：加拿大代表团原先向委员会提出的提案现在成了加、美、英、法、苏五国代表团的联合提案。维辛斯基指出，这一点是即使一些尽量在作悲观宣传的代表也不得不承认的。
    维辛斯基指出，过去苏联同西方国家有着重大的分歧，例如在裁减军备的阶段这一重要的原则上就存在着分歧，但是目前这种分歧消除了。一方面，西方国家采纳了苏联从一开始就坚持的裁减军备原则，另一方面，苏联的提案也考虑到英法两国关于在两个阶段内裁减常规军备和武装部队的建议。
    维辛斯基谈到大家在辩论当中经常提到的裁减军备和武装部队应该从什么水平开始的问题说：苏联的计划和法英两国的备忘录一样，建议以各国一九五三年十二月三十一日的军备和武装部队的数量作为开始实行裁减军备和武装部队的水平。由此可见，在这个问题上以苏联为一方和法、英为另一方的态度是一致的。
    维辛斯基接着谈到苏联关于建立监督机构的建议的要点，他说：根据苏联提案，临时监督委员会的任务是对各国履行裁减常规军备和武装部队的义务进行监督。在规定实行禁止原子武器各项措施的第二阶段中，应建立永久性的监督机构。
    维辛斯基提请政治委员会注意，苏联政府所提的关于裁减军备的第一阶段的建议：规定削减军备的数量为一致同意的定额的百分之五十并规定建立临时监督委员会，苏联政府提出这个建议的目的是使苏联和西方国家的态度接近。
    维辛斯基说，苏联仍然认为，各国达成无条件放弃使用原子武器问题的协议对于促进和加速实行苏联所提的公约中的各项措施是会起极重要作用的，但是苏联并不主张把苏联提案中的计划等到关于各国无条件放弃使用原子武器的问题达成协议后才去实行。
    维辛斯基又谈到关于永久性国际监督机构什么时候开始工作的问题，他说，如果西方国家同意在关于裁减常规军备和禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的各项措施开始执行的时候，这个机构也开始工作，那么在这一方面就没有什么困难了。
    维辛斯基说，苏联主张，在缔结统一的国际公约来实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的计划以前，应当就作为这个国际公约的一部分的、监督机构的职能和权力问题达成协议。
    维辛斯基指出，美国一九五四年五月二十五日提出的所谓“工作文件”，是不能接受的，因为其中包括了一些同监督任务毫无共同之处的条款。例如，这个文件主张给监督机构以惩罚的职能，使监督机构享有应属于安全理事会的权利和权力，而这是违反联合国宪章的。这个“工作文件”是根据早就声名狼藉的、目的为了使美国取得原子控制的“巴鲁克计划”的基本原则制定的。
    维辛斯基最后说，他认为必需再度提醒，苏联的提案中所规定的一些措施具有重要的意义，为了使裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题有更大的可能达成协议，这个公约是以法英的建议为基础的。维辛斯基说，我认为，我们大家注意一下目前苏联的态度和西方国家的态度已经接近的那些问题，是合宜的。为了使这个问题有更大的可能达成协议，苏联希望西方国家也能作出相应的努力。
