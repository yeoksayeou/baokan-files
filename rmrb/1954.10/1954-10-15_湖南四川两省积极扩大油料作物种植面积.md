Hunan and Sichuan Provinces Actively Expand the Planting Area of Oil Crops

    The broad masses of farmers in Hunan Province are actively expanding the planting of rapeseed in accordance with the national plan. In the work of expanding rapeseed planting, most mutual aid and cooperative organizations can actively take the lead in responding to the call of the Party and the government. In Anhua County, Changde Prefecture, farmers in the Thirteenth District, under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, planted more than 260 mu of rapeseed in three days in mid-September. In Jiuxing Township, Ninth District, due to prolonged drought, some fields lacked water and could not be plowed with oxen. The Long Ding'an mutual aid group led individual farmers to dig the soil manually to rush-plant rapeseed. At the mutual aid and cooperation committee in Changtang Township, Linxiang County, Xiangtan Prefecture, the mutual aid group leaders present were educated through the methods of recalling comparisons and specific accounting. The Huang Jixiang mutual aid group originally planned to plant only one or two mu of rapeseed, but after discussion, it was decided to plant sixteen mu. After the Shuangjiang Township, Tongdao County, Qianyang Prefecture, held a meeting of mutual aid group leaders, the mutual aid groups led individual farmers to plant rapeseed, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in edible oil for every household. Now more than 90 percent of the farmers in the township are plowing fields, preparing soil, or have already sown rapeseed. Last year, Qianyang Prefecture planted more than 270,000 mu of rapeseed, and this year it plans to plant 550,000 mu. Yuanling County, which belongs to the district, had sown more than 37,000 mu of rapeseed by September 29, nearly completing half of the county's expansion plan.
    In order to increase the yield per unit area of ​​rapeseed, district and township leaders in many areas have also strengthened technical guidance in a timely manner, promoted intercropping, strip planting, and spot planting experience, and led farmers to carry out fertilizer accumulation and drought resistance work. In the Thirteenth District of Anhua County alone, more than 110,000 dan of various fertilizers such as fire ash and green manure were accumulated in three days. (Our Hunan Reporter Station)
    In Sichuan Province, in conjunction with the unified purchase of grain, many places have mobilized farmers to plant more oil crops. Farmers in Pixian, Longchang, Mianzhu, Jiange and other counties, under the leadership of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives, have formulated plans to increase the planting of oil crops based on possible conditions and national plans. In response to the call of the state, farmers in Pixian County expanded the planting of rapeseed fields by 70.2 percent.
    Now, rapeseed is about to be sown universally, and farmers are busy plowing fields, preparing land, accumulating fertilizer, and exchanging improved varieties, striving to sow in time. To solve the problem of fertilizer shortage, farmers in Pixian County try to reduce the amount of small spring vetches and plant more winter vetches as base fertilizer for planting rapeseed. The county's joint cooperative has prepared 120 million yuan of hemp cake, bone meal, ammonium sulfate and other fertilizers. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places in Wenjiang Prefecture have transported the improved "Japanese rapeseed" varieties that farmers like to Qionglai, Pixian and other eleven counties to supply farmers.

    湖南四川两省积极扩大油料作物种植面积
    湖南省广大农民正按照国家计划，积极扩种油菜。各地互助合作组织在扩种油菜工作中，大多能积极带头响应党和政府的号召。常德专区安化县十三区农民在互助合作组织带动下，九月中旬的三天内就种下了油菜二百六十多亩。九区粟林乡久晴不雨，部分田地缺水，不能用牛犁翻田土，龙定安互助组就带动单干农民用人力挖土，抢种油菜。在湘潭专区临湘县长塘乡的互助合作委员会上，经过回忆对比和具体算账的办法，教育了到会的互助组长。黄吉祥互助组原只计划种一二亩油菜，经过讨论后，决定种植十六亩。黔阳专区通道县双江乡召开互助组长会议以后，各互助组带动单干农民种植油菜，争取做到户户食油自给，现在这乡百分之九十以上的农户都在犁田、整土或已播种油菜。黔阳全区去年种植油菜二十七万多亩，今年计划种植五十五万亩。该区所属的沅陵县，截至九月二十九日止，全县已播种油菜三万七千多亩，近完成全县扩种计划的一半。
    为了提高油菜的单位面积产量，不少地区的区、乡领导上，还及时加强了技术指导，推广了间作、条播、点播等经验，并领导农民开展了积肥和抗旱工作。仅安化县十三区三天内，就积了火土灰、绿肥等各种肥料十一万多担。（本报湖南记者站）
    四川省结合粮食统购工作，很多地方已动员农民多种油料作物。郫县、隆昌、绵竹、剑阁等县农民，在国营农场和农业生产合作社的带动下，都根据可能条件和国家计划订出了增种油料作物的计划。郫县农民响应国家号召，把种植油菜田扩大了百分之七十点二。
    现在，油菜即将普遍播种，农民们正忙着翻田整地，增积肥料，调换良种，争取及时播种。为解决缺肥，郫县农民尽量缩小小春苕子，多种冬苕作为种油菜的底肥。该县县联社已准备了一亿二千万元的麻枯、骨粉、硫酸錏等肥料。温江专区各地供销社已把农民喜爱的“日本油菜”良种，运到邛崃、郫县等十一县供应农民。（本报四川记者站）
