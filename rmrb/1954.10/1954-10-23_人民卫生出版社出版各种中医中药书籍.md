The People's Health Publishing House is actively organizing, editing, and publishing various books on traditional Chinese medicine in a planned and proactive manner to promote the achievements of traditional Chinese medicine and better serve the improvement of people's health. After repeated discussions and studies with relevant parties, especially with people in the field of traditional Chinese medicine, the publishing house first decided to publish a batch of basic books on traditional Chinese medicine. To complete the publishing plan for traditional Chinese medicine books, in addition to deciding to establish a traditional Chinese medicine book editing group within the organization, the publishing house also plans to hire well-known doctors of both traditional Chinese and Western medicine from across the country to form a traditional Chinese medicine book publishing editorial board to carry out this work.

In order to shorten the publishing time and meet social needs as soon as possible, the People's Health Publishing House and the Commercial Press agreed that the Commercial Press would continue to select, print, and publish traditional Chinese medicine books previously published by the Commercial Press. As a result of the consultation between the two parties, the first batch of classical works decided to be published includes: "The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine – Basic Questions," "Spiritual Pivot," "Classic of Difficulties," "Treatise on Cold Damage," "Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber," "Golden Chamber Jade Letter Scripture," "Pulse Classic," "Systematic Classic of Acupuncture and Moxibustion," "Shen Nong's Classic of Materia Medica," "Elbow Reserve Formulas," "Emergency Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold," "Supplement to the Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold," "Secret Essentials from the Imperial Library," "General Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Diseases," "Enlightenment of External Medicine," "Compendium of Materia Medica," "Supplement to the Compendium of Materia Medica," as well as "Medical Secrets," "Treatise on Pestilence," "Systematic Differentiation of Warm Diseases," "Heart and Enlightenment of Medicine," and "Li Yuo Pian Wen," a total of twenty-two kinds. In order to help beginners easily understand the meanings of the "Treatise on Cold Damage" and the "Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber," the publishing house also decided to publish "Modern Explanation of the Treatise on Cold Damage" and "Modern Explanation of the Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber." On the other hand, in order to solve the problem that some people are limited by time and cannot read the voluminous "The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine – Basic Questions" and "Compendium of Materia Medica," concise books such as "Essentials of the Inner Canon" and "Essentials of Materia Medica" will also be published. In terms of printing format, in addition to the Commercial Press continuing to publish using existing paper types, the books published by the People's Health Publishing House will be printed in reduced size, in 18mo paperback format as much as possible, to reduce costs, unify specifications, and facilitate readers' reading. The publication period is expected to start in the fourth quarter of 1954 and be completed successively by the second quarter of 1955. All books will be distributed uniformly by Xinhua Bookstores in various regions. This batch of books includes classical works in Chinese medicine and essential reference books for clinical practice and beginners.

    人民卫生出版社出版各种中医中药书籍
    为发扬祖国医学成就，更好地为增进人民健康服务，人民卫生出版社正在有计划地积极地整理、编辑、出版各种中医中药书籍。该社经同各有关方面，特别是同中医界人士进行了反复的商讨研究后，首先决定出版一批中医学的基础书籍。为了完成中医书出版计划，该社除决定在内部增设中医书编辑组机构外，并拟聘请全国著名中西医组成中医书出版编审委员会，进行此项工作。
    为了缩短出版时间，及早供应社会需要，人民卫生出版社和商务印书馆约定，继续由商务印书馆选印出版该馆以前出版过的中医中药书籍。双方协商结果，第一批决定出版的古典作品有：“内经素问”、“灵枢经”、“难经”、“伤寒论”、“金匮要略”、“金匮玉函经”、“脉经”、“针灸甲乙经”、“神农本草经”、“肘后方”、“备急千金要方”、“千金翼方”、“外台秘要”、“诸病源候论”、“外科启玄”、“本草纲目”、“本草纲目拾遗”以及“医心方”、“瘟疫论”、“温病条辨”、“医学心悟”、“理瀹骈文”等二十二种。为了帮助初学者易于体会“伤寒论”和“金匮要略”二书含义，该社还决定出版加以注解的“伤寒论今释”和“金匮要略今释”两种著作；另一方面，为了解决某些人因受时间所限而不能阅读卷帙浩繁的“内经素问”和“本草纲目”等书，又配合出版“内经知要”和“本草备要”等内容简要的书籍。印刷形式，除商务印书馆仍沿用旧有纸型出版外，人民卫生出版社所出版的尽可能用十八开本平装缩版影印，以降低成本，统一规格，便利读者阅读。出版期限，预计一九五四年第四季度开始出书，至一九五五年第二季度陆续出齐。由各地新华书店统一发行。这一批书籍一部分是中国医学中的古典作品，一部分是临症和初学者的必要参考书籍。
