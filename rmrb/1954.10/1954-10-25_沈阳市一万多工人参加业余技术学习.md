    Over 10,000 Workers in Shenyang Participate in Amateur Technical Studies
    In Shenyang, 11,600 workers from 103 factories are participating in various amateur learning organizations to study technology. Many factories have organized technical training classes, apprentice schools, skill training classes, advanced experience promotion training classes, blueprint reading classes, technical research associations, and technical lectures to organize workers to learn technology.
    After two months of study, most of the workers at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant who participated in amateur skill specialization studies have mastered the characteristics of the new equipment and general cutting specifications, and understood the simple principles of machine tool structure and maintenance methods. Wang Yinghuai, an old worker at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, used to only be able to read blueprints and could not explain the reasoning behind them; after studying, he can now not only make simple drawings, but also explain them to interns from outside the factory. According to a survey of nine machinery factories, since 1953, 80 percent of the technicians who participated in amateur technical studies have been promoted. (Xinhua News Agency)

    沈阳市一万多工人参加业余技术学习
    沈阳市有一百零三个工厂、一万一千六百多名工人，参加各种业余的学习组织学习技术。许多工厂举办了技工训练班、艺徒学校、工种训练班、推广先进经验训练班、识图班和技术研究会和技术讲座，组织工人学习技术。
    沈阳第三机床厂参加业余工种专业学习的工人，经过两个月的学习，大多数能掌握新设备的特点和一般的切削规范，懂得了机床结构的简单原理和检修方法。沈阳第一机床厂老工人汪英怀，过去只会看图纸，说不出道理来；经过学习，现在不仅能制简单的图，还能给厂外实习生讲解。据九个机械工厂的调查，从一九五三年到现在，参加业余技术学习的技工有百分之八十已经升级。（新华社）
