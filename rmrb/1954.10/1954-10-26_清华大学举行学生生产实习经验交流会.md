    Tsinghua University Holds Student Production Internship Experience Exchange Meeting
    On the 23rd, Tsinghua University held the 1954 summer student production internship experience exchange conference, attended by more than 1,500 teachers and students.

    At the meeting, students exchanged their experiences on how to implement the combination of theory and practice, and the integration of politics and professional skills in production internships. Lei Bifen, a senior student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, introduced their experiences in the Shanxi Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory. At the beginning of the internship, the designs they made based solely on theory could not meet the requirements in actual production. After contacting the actual situation and with the help of workers, they completed the design of 55 pieces of applicable fixtures, tools, gauges, and process regulations, and summarized the experience of automatic machine processing. Li Shaofu, a senior student from the Department of Civil Engineering who had served as a concrete foreman's assistant at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, described the process of designing his technical plan. When the factory was building a reservoir, the incorrect technical plan was adopted, which prevented the project from proceeding smoothly. Li Shaofu worked with the workers to propose a new technical plan and insisted on constructing according to this correct plan, so that the project proceeded smoothly. Gu Yongchang, a senior student from the Department of Electrical Engineering, interned at a power plant with relatively outdated equipment. During the internship, they felt that as a new technician, they should not only have the ability to build new factories, but also be responsible for the innovation of old factories. After careful research, they made rationalization suggestions for improving the "power distribution room" equipment of this power plant, which played a significant role in safe production.

    清华大学举行学生生产实习经验交流会
    二十三日，清华大学举行一九五四年暑期学生生产实习经验交流大会，参加大会的教师、学生等共一千五百多人。
    会上学生们交谈了在生产实习中怎样贯彻理论联系实际，政治和业务相结合的体会。机械制造系四年级学生雷璧芬介绍了他们在山西经纬纺织机械厂实习中的经验。他们在实习开始时仅根据理论设计的东西，在实际生产中就不能符合要求，经过接触实际和工人的帮助，就完成了适用的夹具、刀具、量具及工艺规程等五十五件的设计，并总结了自动机加工的经验。在第一汽车制造厂曾担任过混凝土工长助手的土木工程系四年级学生李少甫叙述了他设计技术方案的经过。这个工厂在建造贮水池时，由于采用了不正确的技术方案，致使工程不能顺利施工，李少甫和工人们一起研究提出了新的技术方案，并坚持根据这个正确的方案施工，使工程顺利进行，电机工程系四年级学生顾永昌是在一所设备比较陈旧的发电厂实习，实习中使他们感到作为一个新的技术员，不仅要具有建设新厂的能力，对旧型工厂也要负起革新的责任。他们经过仔细的研究，对改善这个发电厂的“配电室”装置提出了合理化建议，对安全生产起着很大的作用。
