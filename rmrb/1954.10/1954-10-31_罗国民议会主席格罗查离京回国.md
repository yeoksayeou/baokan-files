The invitation extended to me by Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader and wise mentor of the Chinese people, has bestowed upon me immense honor. I arrived in your country with the fervent desire to understand the various achievements made by the Chinese people in the five years since liberation.

After a five-week stay, the moment has come to leave your beautiful and hospitable country.

In the People's Republic of China, I have seen an intelligent, hardworking people with a long tradition, who have been permanently freed from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism, thereby gaining their liberation. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they are building their happy new life with unparalleled enthusiasm.

The grand celebration of the great National Day of the People's Republic of China on October 1st, as well as everything I have seen during my visits, have left a deep impression on me.

I have personally witnessed the great strength of the Chinese people in the service of peace, and I have personally witnessed the respect, trust, and love of the Chinese people for the Party, the government, and their leader—Chairman Mao Zedong. At the same time, I have also seen the close unity of the Chinese people, the great achievements they have made in building socialism, and their unwavering determination to defend their achievements and aspirations, and they are resolutely opposed to any attempt by imperialism to infringe upon the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China.

The unbreakable friendship between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people, as well as the significant role of the People's Republic of China in defending peace in Asia and the world, is a source of inspiration and confidence for the Romanian people in carrying out socialist construction together with the people of all fraternal countries, headed by the great Soviet Union, and in the struggle to defend peace.

Now, before bidding farewell to you, please allow me to express my deepest gratitude to the government of the People's Republic of China and to Chairman Mao Zedong himself for the care and hospitality extended to me.

Everything I have seen in China and the excellent people I have met will forever be etched in my heart.

Long live the Chinese people and their great leader, Mao Zedong!

Long live the indestructible friendship between the Romanian and Chinese peoples!

Long live the great friend of the Romanian and Chinese peoples—the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    罗马尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊以及中华人民共和国在保卫亚洲及世界和平中的重大作用，是罗马尼亚人民同以伟大苏联为首的各兄弟国家的人民在一起进行社会主义建设和在保卫和平的斗争中获得鼓舞和信心的源泉。
