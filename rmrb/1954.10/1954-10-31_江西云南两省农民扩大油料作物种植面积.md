Farmers in Jiangxi and Yunnan Provinces are actively expanding the planting area for oil crops. In Jiangxi, farmers are actively plowing their fields to expand the acreage for oil crops. The province's oil crop production plan for this year is 5.5 million mu, an increase of 110% compared to last year. When the Longgang Township Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiujiang County initially began planting, some members were not very enthusiastic. Addressing the members' thoughts, the cooperative's director first explained the great significance of expanding the oil crop planting area from the perspective of national construction and people's livelihoods. He then specifically used detailed accounting methods to illustrate the benefits of planting more rapeseed. As a result, the entire cooperative planted 28 mu of ridges with rapeseed. Influenced by the cooperative, surrounding mutual aid groups and individual farmers also actively expanded their rapeseed planting area. After understanding the significance of increasing oil production, members of the Peng Shumu mutual aid group in Liusi Township, Hukou County, also expanded their planting area by more than 20 mu. Member Peng Guixuan said: "Initially, I didn't pay attention to the matter of increasing the rapeseed planting area. I originally thought of planting a mu or so, enough for myself to eat. Now I realize that this is a selfish idea that doesn't consider the interests of the country." He also expressed that he would definitely produce according to the needs of the country, planting more rapeseed to supply more edible oil to urban and rural people. More than 29 mu of land belonging to the Peng Shumu mutual aid group were affected by floods, and there was still a lot of stagnant water after the water receded. In order to plant rapeseed in time, the members were busy digging ditches to drain the water. At the same time, they also prepared a lot of fertilizer to apply to the rapeseed fields, striving for a greater harvest.
At present, farmers in various places are seizing the season and working hard to complete the province's oil crop production plan. (Report from Jiangxi Reporter Station of this newspaper)

Yunnan has universally expanded the planting area for oil crops during the autumn planting season. Judging from the main areas for planting rapeseed, the winter rapeseed planting area in the province will increase by about 40% or more compared to last year. For example, Guangnan, Maguan, Qiubei, and Xichou counties in Wenshan Prefecture have all overfulfilled the plan for expanding planting by 15%. The Shuanghe Village in Longquan Township, Zhanyi County, Qujing Prefecture, has doubled the area for expanding oil crop planting this year compared to last year. Last year, Liaochang Township, Fifth District, Weixin County, Zhaotong Prefecture, only planted 130 mu of oil crops, but this year it has expanded to 1,009 mu.
Governments at all levels have specifically assigned the task of planting oil crops to their affiliated farms, and agricultural production cooperatives and better perennial mutual aid groups have taken the lead in responding to the call. In areas with high yields and where the masses have a habit of planting, large-scale planting is encouraged; in areas where the masses are not accustomed to planting but where natural conditions are suitable, appropriate planting of a portion is encouraged. In order to avoid squeezing out other crops when expanding the planting of oil crops, the masses have also created methods such as using winter fallow land or wasteland, intercropping in broad bean and wheat fields, and scattering flax along field edges and ditches. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups have also formulated irrigation and fertilization plans. In order to help farmers complete their plans, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry is actively preparing pesticides and agricultural machinery, and sending technicians to help farmers prevent and control various pests. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are also actively allocating seeds and agricultural tools, and helping farmers solve difficulties in cultivation in a timely manner. Party committees and governments at all levels have also organized forces to conduct timely inspections, discover problems and solve them in a timely manner, so that the task of expanding oil crop planting can be successfully completed.

    江西云南两省农民扩大油料作物种植面积
      江西农民积极翻耕田地，扩大油料作物种植面积。今年该省油料作物生产计划是五百五十万亩，较去年扩大百分之一百一十。九江县龙岗乡第二农业生产合作社，在开始种植时，有些社员不够积极。针对社员的思想，社长首先从国家建设和人民生活需要，说明扩大油料作物种植面积的重大意义，并具体用算细账的办法，说明多种油菜的好处，结果全社把二十八亩垅田种上了油菜。在该社的影响下，周围互助组，单干农民也都积极扩大油菜种植面积。湖口县流泗乡彭述木互助组组员，懂得了增产油料意义后，也扩大了种植面积二十多亩。组员彭贵轩说：增加油菜种植面积的事，起初没有引起我的注意，原想种亩把田，够自己吃就算了；现在我认识到这是只顾自己，不顾国家利益的思想。并表示一定按照国家的需要来生产，多种油菜，供应城乡人民更多的食油。彭述木互助组还有二十九亩多田受了水灾，水退后还有很多渍水，为了及时种上油菜，组员们忙着开沟排水，同时还准备了很多肥料下到油菜田里，争取更大的丰收。

    云南各地在秋种中普遍扩大了油料作物的种植面积。从种植菜籽的主要地区来看，冬菜子种植面积，全省将比去年增加约百分之四十以上。如文山专区的广南、马关、邱北、西畴四县均超额完成扩种计划百分之十五。曲靖专区的沾益县龙泉乡双河村今年扩种油料作物面积比去年增加一倍。昭通专区的威信县五区料场乡去年只种油料作物一百三十亩，今年扩大到一千零九亩。
    各级人民政府对所属的农场都具体分给了种植油料作物任务，农业生产合作社及较好的常年互助组纷纷带头响应号召。在产量高和群众有种植习惯的地区，提倡大量种植；在群众不习惯，但自然条件适合的地区，则适当的提倡种植一部分。为了不使扩种油料作物挤掉其他农作物，群众还创造了利用冬闲田或开荒地和在蚕豆、小麦田内间种，地边沟内撒胡麻等办法。有不少的农业生产合作社、互助组还订立了灌溉和压肥的计划。为了帮助农民完成计划，省府农林厅积极准备农药、农械。并派技术人员帮助农民防治各种虫害。各地供销合作社亦积极调拨种籽、农具，及时帮助农民解决耕种中的困难。各级党委和人民政府并组织力量及时进行检查，发现问题及时的解决，使扩种油料作物任务顺利完成。
