To support farmers in disaster areas in production and self-relief, the People's Bank has issued over 5.1 trillion yuan in production and disaster relief loans to farmers in disaster areas by the beginning of October. Among them, Hunan Province reached over 1.3 trillion yuan, and Anhui Province reached over 1 trillion yuan. Currently, People's Banks in various disaster areas are continuing to issue loans.

When issuing loans, banks in various disaster areas implemented the principle of prioritizing assistance to agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations and warmly caring for the difficulties of individual farmers. In Hubei Province, loans to mutual aid and cooperation organizations generally accounted for 70 percent of the total loans issued by the bank. In Echeng County, Hubei Province, four out of five mutual aid teams in District One collapsed after the disaster. After receiving bank loans, not only were these four mutual aid teams consolidated, but a new mutual aid team was also organized. Farmers in disaster areas actively drained water and restored agricultural and sideline production after receiving bank loans. After farmers in the Huohe District of Dangtu County, Anhui Province, received more than 81 million yuan in loans, they purchased equipment, drained the accumulated water, and replanted some of the rice fields. In addition, People's Banks in disaster areas also paid attention to supporting the consolidation and development of credit cooperatives.

    支援灾区农民生产自救人民银行发放贷款五千多亿元
    到十月上旬止，人民银行发放到灾区农民手中的生产救灾贷款有五千一百多亿元。其中湖南省达一千三百多亿元，安徽省达一千多亿元。目前，各灾区的人民银行还在继续发放。
    各灾区的银行在发放贷款时，贯彻了优先扶助农业生产互助合作组织和热情照顾个体农民的困难的原则。湖北省一般地区互助合作组织的贷款占银行发放总数的百分之七十。湖北省鄂城县一区五个互助组受灾后就垮了四个，经银行贷款以后，这四个互助组不但重新巩固起来，而且又新组织了一个互助组。灾区农民得到了银行贷款，就积极排除积水和恢复农副业生产。安徽省当涂县获河区农民得到八千一百多万元贷款后，购买器材，排除了积水，补种了部分稻田。此外，灾区人民银行还注意扶助信用合作社巩固和发展。　（新华社）
