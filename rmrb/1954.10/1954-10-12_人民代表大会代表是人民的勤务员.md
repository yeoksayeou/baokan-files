People's Congress deputies, elected through universal suffrage, are envoys sent by the people to the national organs of power and faithful servants of the people. People's Congress deputies in our country are fundamentally different from parliamentarians in any bourgeois congress. The majority of parliamentarians in bourgeois congresses serve the minority of the bourgeoisie and are agents of bourgeois rule over the broad masses of the people; while People's Congress deputies in our country serve the people and, whether judged by their origin or composition, are true representatives of the people.

I

People's Congress deputies in our country are elected directly or indirectly by voters according to a genuinely democratic and practical electoral system. Our country's electoral system guarantees the broad masses of the people enjoy unrestricted suffrage. Article 86, paragraph 1, of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of eighteen have the right to vote and to be elected, regardless of nationality, race, sex, occupation, social origin, religious belief, education, property status, or length of residence. However, persons with mental illness and persons deprived of the right to vote and to be elected according to law are excluded." Our country only deprives that small handful of feudal landlords, bureaucrat-capitalists, and counter-revolutionaries of the right to vote. According to statistics from the Central Election Committee, the total number of registered voters in the national grassroots elections this time was 323,809,684, accounting for 97.18 percent of the total population over the age of eighteen in the electoral districts, while those legally deprived of electoral rights, plus the mentally ill, accounted for only 2.82 percent. At the same time, our country's electoral system also fully guarantees that all classes and strata have representatives in the people's congresses at all levels commensurate with their status. The people can widely participate in the nomination of candidates; the right to nominate candidates belongs to the Communist Party of China, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and people and representatives who do not belong to the aforementioned parties or organizations. Voters can fully and freely express their will and are protected by various legal and material guarantees. Therefore, such an electoral system fully guarantees that the broad masses of the people in our country can elect the true people's representatives they deem satisfactory and necessary. The people's representatives elected in our country include outstanding figures from all classes and strata who are truly loved by the people. Many of them are labor models, advanced workers, activists in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and agricultural production in rural areas, heroes and meritorious personnel of the armed forces, model military dependents, and outstanding government cadres. In the elections, Communist Party members gained the greatest trust of the voters, indicating that the people are increasingly deeply aware that the Communist Party of China, headed by Chairman Mao, is the only reliable force leading the Chinese people to a happy life. This has powerfully consolidated the leading position of the working class and ensured the continuous consolidation and development of our country's people's democratic system.

Once elected, the People's Congress becomes the organ through which the people exercise their power. Article 2, paragraph 1, of our country's Constitution stipulates: "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels." Entrusted by the people, the people's representatives shoulder the important responsibility of managing national affairs. In order to enable the representatives to fulfill the important trust of the people, it is necessary to grant the representatives extensive rights and stipulate the obligations that the representatives must fulfill. The rights and obligations of the representatives are both indispensable conditions for fulfilling the people's trust. To this end, our country's Constitution has made clear provisions regarding the basic principles of the rights and obligations of the People's Congress deputies. This will ensure that the People's Congress can become a true representative organ of the people.

II

Because all power in our country belongs to the people, the people's representatives enjoy extremely broad rights. Among the various rights and obligations of the representatives, one of the most important rights and obligations is to participate in the work of the People's Congress sessions. The People's Congress is the organ for exercising state power, and the People's Congress session is the basic form of the representatives' work. At the session, the representatives have the right to freely discuss all issues submitted to the session for review, and they can also submit proposals to the People's Congress. The right of free speech for the people's representatives in our country is fully guaranteed. Chairman Mao once instructed: "It is necessary to ensure that the representatives attending the People's Congress meetings have full freedom of speech. Any action that suppresses the speech of the people's representatives is wrong." (Report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 6, 1950) Representatives participating in discussions and submitting proposals on various issues can concentrate the wisdom and creativity of the broad masses of the people, strengthen the connection between state organs and the people, and continuously improve and innovate the various tasks of our country.

In addition to participating in discussions and submitting proposals at the session, deputies to the National People's Congress also have the right to pass binding resolutions or enact laws by a majority vote. The National People's Congress is the only legislative body in our country. Article 29 of our country's Constitution stipulates: "Amendments to the Constitution shall be adopted by a vote of no less than two-thirds of the total number of deputies to the National People's Congress. Laws and other bills shall be adopted by a vote of no less than one-half of the total number of deputies to the National People's Congress." At the First National People's Congress, all the deputies, representing the will of the 600 million people of our country, solemnly and unanimously adopted the first Constitution of the People's Republic of China. As for the local people's congresses at all levels, they also have the right to pass resolutions within their functions and powers. The various laws and resolutions passed by the deputies to the National People's Congress are the highest embodiment of the will of the people of the entire country and must be observed by all state organs and citizens.

The National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power. According to the provisions of our country's Constitution, it has the power to elect the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the President and Vice-President of the People's Republic of China; to decide on the choice of the Premier of the State Council and other members of the State Council, as well as the Vice-Chairmen and members of the National Defense Council; and to elect the President of the Supreme People's Court and the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. As members of the National People's Congress, the deputies to the National People's Congress have the right to participate in the election of the leading staff of the above-mentioned state organs at the session.

As for the local people's congresses at all levels, they are the local organs of state power in our country. The deputies to the local people's congresses at all levels also have the right to elect the members of the people's committees at their respective levels at the session. Deputies to the people's congresses at the county level and above also have the right to participate in the election of the presidents of the people's courts at their respective levels, and deputies to the people's congresses of provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government also have the right to participate in the election of the presidents of the intermediate people's courts. This shows that the People's Congress in our country is a true organ of state power, and all power is concentrated in the hands of the people.

The National People's Congress not only has the power to create state organs such as the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the President and Vice-President of the People's Republic of China, the State Council, the National Defense Council, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, but also has the power to supervise the work of these state organs. The People's Congress exercises its power to supervise state administrative organs through the deputies. The deputies' realization of the right to supervise state organs embodies the democratic principle of combining deliberation and action in our country's state organs, indicating that the People's Congress is an organ with full authority. People's representatives not only have the right to discuss and make resolutions on state affairs, but they also have the right to personally inspect the implementation of these resolutions.

The forms of people's representatives supervising state organs are diverse. State organs created by the People's Congress must be responsible to the People's Congress and report on their work. Listening to work reports from state organs at the sessions of the People's Congress is one form of people's representatives supervising state organs. People's representatives can make suggestions and criticisms regarding the work of state organs.

The most important weapon directly grasped by the people's representatives in supervising state organs is criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism are long-tested and indispensable weapons for our Party and state organs to promote democracy and overcome shortcomings in their work, and they are also necessary means for consolidating our people's democratic system.

Article 36 of our country's Constitution stipulates: "Deputies to the National People's Congress have the right to address questions to the State Council or to the ministries and commissions of the State Council, and the organs to which the questions are addressed must be responsible for answering them." The procedure for deputies to raise questions is clearly stipulated in the Organic Law of the National People's Congress: "Questions raised by deputies to the National People's Congress to the State Council or to the ministries and commissions of the State Council shall be submitted by the Presidium of the National People's Congress session or the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to the organ to which the questions are addressed. The organ to which the questions are addressed must be responsible for answering them to the National People's Congress or the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." As for the deputies to the local people's congresses at all levels, they also enjoy the right to question the administrative organs at their respective levels. The questioning and supervision by the representatives can effectively help state organs to promptly expose and overcome shortcomings and errors, and continuously improve and innovate their work.

People's Congress deputies in our country also enjoy the special privilege of inviolability of their person. Article 37 of our country's Constitution stipulates: "Deputies to the National People's Congress shall not be arrested or placed on trial without the permission of the National People's Congress or, when the National People's Congress is not in session, without the permission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." This special protection of the personal freedom of deputies to the National People's Congress illustrates the sacred and supreme nature of the power of the broad masses of the people and creates convenient conditions for the deputies to carry out their work smoothly, which is sufficient to enhance the representatives' sense of responsibility and work enthusiasm. Therefore, this provision has significant political and practical significance.

According to the provisions of the Organic Law of the National People's Congress, when deputies to the National People's Congress attend sessions of the National People's Congress and perform other duties belonging to the deputies, the state shall provide appropriate subsidies and material conveniences as needed. The source of livelihood of the people's representatives in our country is also fundamentally different from that of bourgeois parliamentarians. The majority of parliamentarians of the bourgeoisie are professional politicians who serve the capitalists, and they are raised by the bourgeoisie with "high salaries" and bribes. The people's representatives in our country are servants of the people, and the vast majority of them undertake certain practical work without being divorced from production; the representatives' livelihood depends on their own wages. At the same time, accepting certain subsidies and material conveniences when performing representative duties creates more convenient conditions for the representatives to carry out their work.

III

In connection with the broad rights enjoyed by the representatives, the representatives must also fulfill certain obligations.

Our country's Constitution makes clear and principled provisions regarding the obligations of the representatives. Article 18 of our country's Constitution stipulates: "All personnel of state organs must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the Constitution and laws, and strive to serve the people." According to this article, Article 32 of the Organic Law of the National People's Congress also stipulates: "Deputies to the National People's Congress must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the Constitution and laws, strive to serve the people, and actively assist in the implementation of the Constitution, laws, and national policies in their own production, work, and social activities."

People's representatives must be loyal to the people's democratic system, because the people's democratic system centrally embodies the will and fundamental interests of the people of the entire country, and it "guarantees that our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society." (Preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China) For the representatives to be loyal to the people's democratic system, they must actively strive to realize the general task of the country during the transition period and to build a beautiful socialist society. Building a socialist society is the urgent desire of the people of the entire country, and taking the lead in building socialism is also the most important expectation of the people for the representatives. As true representatives of the people, they should not fail to live up to this most important expectation of the people, but use their actions to promote its realization.

People's representatives must also be models of abiding by the Constitution and laws. The Constitution and laws are formulated by the deputies to the National People's Congress, and they express the will of the people and consolidate the victorious fruits won by the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China after years of struggle. It establishes social relations and social order that are beneficial to the people. Obeying the Constitution and laws means obeying the will of the people and safeguarding the interests of the people. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China: "The Constitution must be observed by all the people and all state organs. The deputies to the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels, as well as all personnel of state organs, are servants of the people, and all state organs are organs that serve the people. Therefore, they bear special responsibility for abiding by the Constitution and ensuring its implementation." People's representatives should not only themselves abide by the Constitution and laws in an exemplary manner, but also publicize the Constitution and laws to the people, and use the spirit of the people's democratic legal system to educate the masses.

Representatives must proceed from the interests of the people and serve the people faithfully. Article 17 of our country's Constitution stipulates: "All state organs must rely on the masses of the people, maintain close ties with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and accept the supervision of the masses." Therefore, the deputies to the people's congresses at all levels in our country should always pay attention to maintaining close ties with the masses. The form of contact with voters or the original electoral unit is an important issue. Because our country's state system is still in the process of construction, it is not possible to immediately create a set of fixed forms. Therefore, it will be up to the representatives to create them in practical activities in the future. According to the current materials, the people's representatives in many regions have already created some forms of contact with voters (such as reporting work to voters at grassroots unit voter meetings, as well as "voter reception day," "representative holiday visits," "voter message books," etc.). These forms can still be enriched in practice in the future.

Maintaining close ties with the masses of the people means listening to the opinions of the masses, caring about the lives of the people, frequently reflecting the demands of the masses, and actively and proactively helping the masses solve difficulties in production and life. Representatives should convey the resolutions of the People's Congress, publicize various policies and decrees of the government, and become a bridge between the masses of the people and the government.

Relying on the masses of the people and maintaining close ties with the masses of the people can ensure that our state organs become true state organs of the people and can enhance the prestige of our state organs.

Article 38 of our country's Constitution stipulates: "Deputies to the National People's Congress are subject to the supervision of the original electoral unit. The original electoral unit has the right to remove the deputies elected by this unit at any time in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law." Article 61 stipulates: "Deputies to the people's congresses of provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, and cities divided into districts are subject to the supervision of the original electoral unit; deputies to the people's congresses of cities not divided into districts, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships, and towns are subject to the supervision of the voters. The electoral units and voters of the local people's congresses at all levels have the right to remove the deputies they elected at any time in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law." It can be seen that the activities of the deputies to the people's congresses at all levels from the national to the local level are subject to the supervision of their original electoral units or voters. Accepting the supervision of voters or the original electoral unit is a necessary condition for ensuring that the representatives obey the will of the people. As Stalin said: "If the deputy should leave the right path, the electors are entitled to demand new elections, are entitled to send that deputy packing.” (Speech at a meeting of voters of the Stalin electoral district, Moscow, December 11, 1937).

The fact that voters or the original electoral units have the right to supervise and remove the deputies they elected can strengthen the representatives' sense of responsibility and enthusiasm, and at the same time greatly improve the political consciousness of the broad masses of the people.

In summary, deputies to the People's Congress enjoy broad rights and must fulfill certain obligations. The rights and obligations of the people's representatives are inseparable. Whether the representatives exercise their rights or fulfill their obligations, they are all supreme expressions of the people's power, and they are all for safeguarding the interests of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, every right of the representatives is sacred and inviolable, and every obligation of the representatives is glorious and important. People's representatives must fully exercise their rights, faithfully fulfill their obligations, and lead the masses to build our country into a beautiful socialist country, worthy of the trust of the people.

    人民代表大会代表是人民的勤务员
    葛家瑛　张正钊
     一
    经过普选产生的中华人民共和国人民代表大会的代表，是人民派往国家权力机关的使者，是人民忠实的勤务员。我国人民代表大会代表同一切资产阶级国会的议员根本不同。资产阶级国会的大多数议员是为少数资产阶级服务，是资产阶级统治广大人民的代理人；而我国人民代表大会的代表是为人民服务的，无论从其产生和成份来看，都是真正的人民代表。
    我国人民代表大会代表是按照真正民主而又切实可行的选举制度，由选民直接或者间接选举出来的。我国的选举制度保证了广大人民享有无限制选举权。中华人民共和国宪法第八十六条第一款规定：“中华人民共和国年满十八岁的公民，不分民族、种族、性别、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况、居住年限，都有选举权和被选举权。但是有精神病的人和依照法律被剥夺选举权和被选举权的人除外。”我们国家只是剥夺那一小撮封建地主、官僚资本家和反革命分子的选举权。根据中央选举委员会的统计，这一次全国基层选举中登记选民总数为三亿二千三百八十万九千六百八十四人，占进行选举地区十八周岁以上的人口总数的百分之九十七点一八，而依法被剥夺选举权利的人并加上精神病患者，只占百分之二点八二。同时，我国的选举制度也充分保证了各阶层在各级人民代表大会中都有同它的地位相适应的代表。人民群众都能广泛地参加候选人的提名；提名候选人的权利属于中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体和不属于上述党派或团体的人民和代表。选民能完全自由地表达自己的意志，并受到各种法律的和物质的保障。因此，这样的选举制度就充分保证了我国广大人民能选出自己认为满意和必要的真正人民代表来。我国选出来的人民代表包括了各阶级、各阶层的真正为人民所爱戴的优秀人物。他们中有许多是劳动模范、先进工人、农村中互助合作运动和农业生产中的积极分子、部队的英雄和功臣、模范军属、优秀的政府干部。在选举中，共产党员获得了选民的最大信任，表明人民越来越深刻地认识到以毛主席为首的中国共产党是领导中国人民走上幸福生活的唯一可靠的力量。这就有力地巩固了工人阶级的领导地位，保证了我国人民民主制度不断巩固和发展。
    人民选出的人民代表大会，一经产生之后，就成为人民行使权力的机关。我国宪法第二条第一款规定：“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。”人民代表受人民委托，担负管理国家大事的重大责任。为了使代表能完成人民的重大委托，就必须赋予代表以广泛的权利，并规定代表必须履行的义务。代表的权利和义务都是完成人民委托必不可少的条件，为此，我国宪法对人民代表大会代表的权利和义务的基本原则作了明确的规定。这将保证人民代表大会能够成为真正的人民代表机关。二
    由于我国一切权力属于人民，因此，人民代表就享有极为广泛的权利。在代表的各项权利和义务之中，一项最重要的权利和义务，就是参加人民代表大会会议的工作。人民代表大会是行使国家权力的机关，而人民代表大会会议，就是代表工作的基本形式。在会议上代表有权利对提交给会议所审查的一切问题展开自由的讨论，也可以向人民代表大会提出议案。我国人民代表自由发言的权利是得到充分保证的。毛主席曾经指示说：“必须使出席人民代表会议的代表们有充分的发言权，任何压制人民代表发言的行动都是错误的。”（一九五○年六月六日在中国共产党第七届第三次中央全体会议上的报告）代表对各项问题参加讨论，提出议案，就能集中广大人民群众的智慧和创造精神，加强国家机关同人民群众间的联系，使我们国家的各项工作不断改进和革新。
    全国人民代表大会的代表除在会议上参加讨论和提出议案外，还有权以多数通过强制性的决议或制定法律。全国人民代表大会是我国唯一的立法机关，我国宪法第二十九条的规定：“宪法的修改由全国人民代表大会以全体代表的三分之二的多数通过。法律和其他议案由全国人民代表大会以全体代表的过半数通过。”在第一届全国人民代表大会的会议上，全体代表们代表着我国六亿人民的意志庄严地一致通过了中华人民共和国第一个宪法。至于地方各级人民代表大会，在职权范围内也有权通过决议。经全国人民代表大会代表通过的各项法律及决议是全国人民意志的最高体现，是一切国家机关和公民所必须遵守的。
    全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关，按照我国宪法的规定，它有权选举全国人民代表大会常务委员会，中华人民共和国主席、副主席；决定国务院总理和国务院其他组成人员以及国防委员会副主席和委员的人选；选举最高人民法院院长和最高人民检察院检察长。作为全国人民代表大会的成员，全国人民代表大会代表就有权在会议上参加选举组成以上的国家机关的领导工作人员。
    至于地方各级人民代表大会，是我国地方国家权力机关，地方各级人民代表大会的代表也有权在会议上选举本级人民委员会的组成人员。县级以上人民代表大会代表还有权参加选举本级人民法院院长，省、直辖市的人民代表大会代表并有权参加选举中级人民法院院长。这说明我国人民代表大会是真正的国家权力机关，一切权力集中在人民手中。
    全国人民代表大会不仅有权产生全国人民代表大会常务委员会、中华人民共和国主席和副主席、国务院、国防委员会、最高人民法院和最高人民检察院等国家机关，而且有权对这些国家机关的工作实行监督。人民代表大会监督国家行政机关的权力是通过代表来行使的，人民代表实现对国家机关监督的权利，这体现了我们国家机关议行合一的民主原则，表明人民代表大会是全权机关，人民代表不仅对国家大事有讨论并作出决议的权利，而且他们还有权来亲自检查这些决议的执行。
    人民代表监督国家机关的形式是多种多样的。由人民代表大会产生的国家机关必须向人民代表大会负责并报告工作。在人民代表大会会议上听取国家机关的工作报告，这是人民代表监督国家机关的一种形式。人民代表可以对国家机关的工作提出建议和批评。
    人民代表监督国家机关所直接掌握的最重要的武器就是批评和自我批评。批评和自我批评是我们党和国家机关发扬民主、克服工作的缺点的久经锻炼的不可缺少的武器，也是巩固我们人民民主制度的必要手段。
    我国宪法第三十六条规定：“全国人民代表大会代表有权向国务院或者国务院各部、各委员会提出质问，受质问的机关必须负责答复。”关于代表提出质问的程序在全国人民代表大会组织法中作了明确的规定：“全国人民代表大会代表向国务院或者国务院各部、各委员会提出的质问，经过全国人民代表大会会议主席团或者全国人民代表大会常务委员会提交受质问的机关。受质问的机关必须向全国人民代表大会或者全国人民代表大会常务委员会负责答复。”至于地方各级人民代表大会代表也享有对本级行政机关的质问权。代表的质问和监督能卓有成效地帮助国家机关及时揭露并克服缺点和错误，不断提高和改进工作。
    我国人民代表大会代表还享有人身不可侵犯的特权。我国宪法第三十七条规定：“全国人民代表大会代表，非经全国人民代表大会许可，在全国人民代表大会闭会期间非经全国人民代表大会常务委员会许可，不受逮捕或者审判。”这种对全国人民代表大会代表人身自由的特殊保护，说明广大人民权力的神圣和至高无上性，并为代表们顺利进行工作创造了便利的条件，足以提高代表的责任感及工作积极性，因此，这种规定具有重大的政治实践意义。
    根据全国人民代表大会组织法的规定，全国人民代表大会代表在出席全国人民代表大会会议和执行其他属于代表的职务时，国家根据需要给以适当的津贴和物质上的便利。我国的人民代表的生活来源也同资产阶级的议员根本不同。资产阶级的大多数议员是为资本家服务的职业政客，他们是由资产阶级用“高额薪俸”和贿赂所豢养着的。我国的人民代表是人民的勤务员，他们绝大部分担负着一定的实际工作，不脱离生产；代表生活是靠自己的工薪。同时，在执行代表职务时接受一定的补助和物质方便，这就给代表进行工作创造了更为便利的条件。三
    同代表所享有的广泛权利相联系，代表还必须履行一定的义务。
    我国宪法对于代表的义务作了明确的、原则性的规定。我国宪法第十八条规定：“一切国家机关工作人员必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，努力为人民服务。”根据这一条，全国人民代表大会组织法第三十二条也作了规定：“全国人民代表大会代表必须效忠人民民主制度，遵守宪法和法律，努力为人民服务，并且在自己参加的生产、工作和社会活动中，主动地协助宪法、法律和国家政策的实施。”
    人民代表必须效忠人民民主制度，因为人民民主制度集中体现了全国人民的意志和根本利益，它“保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。”（中华人民共和国宪法序言）代表要效忠人民民主制度，就必须积极为实现国家在过渡时期总任务，为建设美好的社会主义社会而努力。建设社会主义社会，这是全国人民的迫切愿望，带头建设社会主义，这也是人民对代表最重要的期望。作为真正的人民代表就应该不辜负人民这个最重要的期望，而用自己的行动来促使它实现。
    人民代表还必须是遵守宪法和法律的模范，宪法和法律是全国人民代表大会代表制定的，它表现了人民的意志，巩固了广大人民在中国共产党领导下经过多年斗争得来的胜利果实，它确定了有利于人民群众的社会关系和社会秩序。服从宪法和法律就是服从人民的意志，维护人民的利益。刘少奇同志在关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告中指出：“宪法是全体人民和一切国家机关都必须遵守的。全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的代表以及一切国家机关的工作人员，都是人民的勤务员，一切国家机关都是为人民服务的机关，因此，他们在遵守宪法和保证宪法的实施方面，就负有特别的责任。”人民代表不仅自己应该模范地遵守宪法和法律，而且还应该向人民宣传宪法和法律，以人民民主的法制精神来教育群众。
    代表必须从人民的利益出发，忠实为人民服务。我国宪法第十七条规定：“一切国家机关必须依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督。”因此，我国各级人民代表大会代表就应当经常注意保持同群众的密切联系。关于联系选民或原选举单位的形式，是一个重要的问题。由于我国国家制度还在建设的过程中，还不能立即创造出一套固定的形式，因此今后还待代表们在实际活动中去创造。根据现在材料看来，不少地区的人民代表已经创造出一些联系选民的形式（如在基层单位选民大会中向选民报告工作，以及“选民接待日”、“代表假日访问”、“选民留言簿”等），这些形式将来还可以在实践中丰富起来。
    保持同人民群众的密切联系，这就是说，必须倾听人民群众的意见，关心人民的生活，经常反映人民群众的要求，主动地、积极地帮助群众解决生产上的和生活上的困难。代表应该传达人民代表大会的决议，宣传政府的各种政策和法令，成为人民群众同政府之间的桥梁。
    代表依靠人民群众并经常保持同人民群众的密切联系，就能保证我们国家机关成为真正的人民的国家机关，就能提高我们国家机关的威信。
    我国宪法第三十八条规定：“全国人民代表大会代表受原选举单位的监督。原选举单位有权依照法律规定的程序随时撤换本单位选出的代表。”第六十一条规定：“省、直辖市、县、设区的市的人民代表大会代表受原选举单位的监督；不设区的市、市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇的人民代表大会代表受选民的监督。地方各级人民代表大会代表的选举单位和选民有权依照法律规定的程序随时撤换自己选出的代表。”由此可见，我国从全国到地方各级人民代表大会代表的活动都受到它原选举单位或选民的监督。接受选民或原选举单位的监督，这是保证代表服从人民意志的必要条件。正像斯大林所说：“如果代表竟离开正轨，选举人就有权要求实行新选举，就有权叫这种离开正轨的代表滚开。”（一九三七年十二月十一日在莫斯科城斯大林选区选民大会上的演说）
    选民或原选举单位有权监督和撤换自己选出的代表，就能加强代表的责任感和积极性，同时也能大大提高广大人民的政治自觉性。
    综上所述，人民代表大会的代表是享有广泛的权利和必须履行一定的义务的。人民代表的权利和义务是不可分的。代表无论行使权利或履行义务都是人民权力至高无上的表现，都是为了维护广大人民的利益，因此，代表的每一项权利都是神圣不可侵犯的，而代表的每一项义务也都是光荣重大的。人民代表必须充分地行使自己的权利，忠诚地履行自己的义务，带动群众把我国建成一个美好的社会主义国家，无愧于人民的信任。
