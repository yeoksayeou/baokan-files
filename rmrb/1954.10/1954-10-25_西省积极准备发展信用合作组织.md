Shaanxi Province Actively Prepares to Develop Credit Cooperative Organizations

Credit cooperative organizations in Shaanxi Province have seen great development this year. According to statistics from the Shaanxi Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China, as of the end of August, the province had established 1,321 credit cooperatives and 3,832 credit mutual aid groups. Among them, 1,046 credit cooperatives were established in the eight months of this year, nearly tripling the 275 established last year. The credit cooperative organizations in the province currently have a total share capital of 8.636 billion yuan, accumulated deposits of 63.511 billion yuan from January to August, and loans of 38.183 billion yuan. These credit cooperative organizations have vigorously combated rural usurers and supported agricultural production through various business activities. For example, the 16 credit cooperatives in Long County provided loans to help farmers purchase more than 120 head of draft animals and more than 2,080 pieces of agricultural equipment in the first half of this year.

The credit cooperative organizations in Shaanxi Province are still far behind the needs of the vast number of farmers. At the rural financial work conference held in mid-September, the Shaanxi Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China decided that by the end of this year, the province should develop 3,000 credit cooperatives. Ten counties, including Chang'an, Chaoyi, Yangxian, Mianxian, and Xixiang, can achieve a credit cooperative in every township by the end of the year.

In order to welcome the upsurge of developing credit cooperative organizations this winter and next spring, various regions are actively carrying out various preparatory work. Many regions' People's Banks, under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, are vigorously training cadres for developing credit cooperative organizations by holding short-term credit cooperative training classes and organizing cadres from existing credit cooperatives and active members of cooperative establishment to hold discussions and exchange experiences. The province will train 6,000 cooperative establishment cadres in October and November. (Hao Jian)

    陕西省积极准备发展信用合作组织
    陕西省各地信用合作组织今年已有很大发展。据中国人民银行陕西省分行统计，截至八月底，全省已建立起一千三百二十一个信用合作社和三千八百三十二个信用互助组。其中信用合作社，今年八个月就建立了一千零四十六个，比去年的二百七十五个增加了将近三倍。该省的信用合作组织现有股金八十六亿三千六百多万元，一月到八月存款累计达六百三十五亿一千一百万元，放款三百八十一亿八千三百多万元。这些信用合作组织通过各种业务活动，有力地打击了农村的高利贷者，支持了农业生产。如陇县的十六个信用合作社，在今年上半年内，就贷款帮助农民购买耕畜一百二十多头、农具二千零八十多件。
    陕西省的信用合作组织现在还远远落后于广大农民的需要。中国人民银行陕西省分行在九月中旬召开的农村金融工作会议上作出决定，到今年年底，全省信用合作社要发展到三千个。长安、朝邑、洋县、沔县、西乡等十个县，到年底可达到乡乡有社。
    为了迎接今冬明春发展信用合作组织的热潮，各地正积极进行各项准备工作。不少地区的人民银行，在当地党委、政府的领导下，通过举办短期信用合作训练班、组织现有信用合作社的干部和办社积极分子座谈、交流经验等办法，大力训练发展信用合作组织的干部。全省在十月、十一月间，就要训练六千名建社干部。　（郝健）
