    In order to further enhance the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, expand Soviet economic assistance to our country, and strengthen economic and cultural ties between the two countries, the Chinese and Soviet governments recently issued a series of communiqués and statements. These communiqués and statements cover an extremely wide range, including a communiqué transferring Soviet shares in the four Sino-Soviet joint ventures to our country; two donation statements: donating 83 items, such as machine tools and agricultural machinery exhibited in the Soviet Exhibition Hall, to our government, and donating a complete set of machinery and equipment needed for a large-scale state-owned grain farm that can cultivate 300,000 mu of wasteland; and several agreements on further assistance to our country's construction, namely, the Soviet government's decision to help our country build 15 new industrial enterprises and expand the scope of equipment supply and technical assistance for 141 enterprises, and to provide comprehensive technical assistance to our country in the construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway line. At the same time, the governments of China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia also issued a joint communiqué on the construction of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway and the organization of joint transportation. The Chinese people express a very warm welcome and heartfelt gratitude for these communiqués and statements, because this will more powerfully promote our country's economic development and bring enormous benefits to our country's socialist construction.
    The four joint ventures decided to have their Soviet shares transferred to our country in the communiqué are the non-ferrous and rare metal company and the petroleum company in Xinjiang, the shipbuilding and repair company in Dalian, and the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company. These four companies were all established in 1950 and 1951. Let us recall the situation at that time! At that time, our national economy had not yet recovered. Due to inconvenient transportation and imperialist blockade, domestic and foreign trade had not yet developed greatly. Although we took over a number of industrial and mining enterprises, we still lacked management experience, and we faced serious difficulties in capital and technology. The imperialists were waiting for the newborn China to collapse every day; American bandits instructed the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to constantly attack and bomb Shanghai. In those difficult years, the Soviet government generously extended its hand and jointly established four major companies with our country, fully supporting our country's newborn economy. What a moving friendship!
    These four companies were the first batch of newly built and expanded socialist enterprises after the founding of New China. The establishment of these companies established the first rare metal mining industrial base in our country, greatly improved the technical level and production capacity of the petroleum and shipbuilding industries, and strengthened the connection between the heart of our motherland—Beijing and the northwest and northeast border areas. Through these companies, the Soviet Union has also cultivated and trained a group of new construction talents for our country in recent years. For example, the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company, by October of last year, its drilling production had increased more than six times compared to 1951, its crude oil production had increased more than eighteen times, and it had trained more than two thousand outstanding technicians and skilled workers, which was more than thirteen times more than the total number of employees in the factory in 1950. The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company has developed more than 9,000 kilometers of routes in recent years, and its transportation volume from 1950 to the present has increased three times. It has also trained a group of new civil aviation personnel and established a complete set of scientific management systems. Now, when this batch of enterprises is growing, blossoming, and bearing fruit like a garden of melons and fruits, the Soviet Union is transferring all the shares it used to operate to our country, selflessly making this batch of enterprises completely state-owned enterprises of the People's Republic of China. This unparalleled profound friendship has never existed between any country in any historical era. All these facts have profoundly educated all Chinese people and made them more clearly realize that the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union are essentially completely different from the relations between capitalist countries.
    After our country rapidly ended the recovery of the national economy, it entered a period of large-scale construction starting in 1953. Our task is to strive to build a great socialist country with industrialized and highly modern cultural standards from a country that was originally economically and culturally backward within a few five-year plans. Of course, there are many difficulties in achieving this task. Overcoming these difficulties requires not only our own efforts, but also the assistance and support of international friends. During this period, we received particularly great and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union. At the beginning of the implementation of our country's Five-Year Plan, the Soviet government generously promised to help our country build 141 enterprises. This batch of enterprises constitutes the backbone of our country's economic construction. After they are completed, they will lay a solid foundation for our country's national industrialization and defense modernization. Today, on this basis, in order to further promote the comprehensive development of our country's economic construction, the Soviet government has decided to help our country build 15 new industrial enterprises and expand the scope of equipment supply for 141 enterprises. This is another great assistance given to us by the Soviet government and people.
    The Soviet government's decision to provide China with other economic and technical assistance is extremely important for our country's construction. As everyone knows, our country will soon enter the third year of the Five-Year Plan. In the last three years of the first Five-Year Plan, we have the largest workload, the most arduous tasks, and the most intense work in terms of capital construction. Today, the Soviet Union's various assistance to us will more powerfully help us overcome difficulties, greatly promote the progress of our country's various constructions, and ensure the completion of construction tasks. The construction of the Lanzhou-Almaty and Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway lines will not only strengthen the political, economic, and cultural ties between our country's inland and border areas, and further consolidate the unity of all nationalities, but also further strengthen the economic and cultural ties between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, as well as between China and the people's democratic countries in Europe.
    "The Soviet government delegation's statement on the Soviet people donating machinery and equipment to the Chinese people to organize large-scale state-owned grain farms" is also of great significance to our country. As everyone knows, the most prominent problem in our country's agricultural production at present is that on the one hand, there is a large population and little arable land, but on the other hand, there are still about one billion mu of arable land that has not been reclaimed. This is because the state does not currently have enough funds, because our country's industry cannot produce reclamation machinery in large quantities, and because we lack experience in large-scale organization of reclamation. However, after a certain period of time, this undertaking must be greatly developed, which is one of the fundamental ways to expand agricultural production. At this time, the Soviet Union donated a large number of machines and dispatched experts to help us organize a large-scale state-owned farm, which is a particularly needed and very timely measure for our country. The establishment of this highly mechanized farm, mainly for grain production, can not only systematically introduce the experience accumulated by the Soviet Union in reclaiming wasteland to our country, but also train cadres, set an example, improve our country's agricultural production technology, promote the further improvement of management and production levels of our country's existing state-owned farms, and accumulate experience for a large amount of wasteland reclamation in the future.
    From the above communiqués and statements, and from these friendly actions, the Chinese people once again deeply feel that the Soviet people will always be our most reliable and loyal friends. As we move forward along the road of socialism, we will always receive the friendly cooperation and active support of the Soviet government and people. This is a fraternal, truly friendly, and truly constructive assistance, which is based on mutual help and the promotion of common progress and prosperity. The Chinese people, especially the personnel of the economic work departments, should cherish the Soviet Union's assistance to our country, consolidate the existing achievements, and utilize and develop the new material and technical assistance given to our country by the Soviet Union to accelerate our country's national economic construction.
    The important task currently before us is to resolutely consolidate the achievements already made by the four companies, and to quickly organize forces to do a good job in the construction of a state-owned farm and two railway lines. In these tasks, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Civil Aviation Administration bear particularly important responsibilities and must put it on the important agenda of daily work. It should be recognized that the above-mentioned established and prepared-to-be-established enterprises are all working according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. By running these enterprises well, and through the demonstration role of these enterprises, more enterprises can be driven forward, and we can avoid many detours and quickly promote the comprehensive upsurge of the national economy. This truth has been confirmed by the experience of the China Changchun Railway. Therefore, all economic departments should conscientiously and systematically sort out and disseminate the experience of various units in promoting Soviet experience, and take this as an important task.
    We sincerely thank the Soviet government and people for their deep concern and assistance to our country's construction. We firmly believe that with the assistance of the Soviet Union and our own efforts, we will surely be able to rapidly advance the cause of national construction and strive for greater success in our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    苏联对我国建设事业的新的援助
    中苏两国政府为了进一步增进中苏友好关系、扩大苏联对我国的经济援助、加强两国相互间经济和文化联系，最近发表了一系列公报和声明。这些公报和声明所涉及的范围极其广泛，其中包括一项将四个中苏合营公司的苏联股份移交给我国的公报；包括两项赠送声明：将苏联展览馆内展览的机床和农业机器等八十三件赠给我国政府，和赠给我国可以开垦三十万亩荒地的大型国营谷物农场所需的全套机器和装备；还包括了几项进一步援助我国建设事业的协议，这就是苏联政府决定帮助我国新建十五项工业企业和扩大一百四十一项企业的设备供应和技术援助范围，决定在兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路线的修建中给予我国全面的技术援助。同时，中苏蒙三国政府还发表了关于修建集宁—乌兰巴托铁路并组织联运的联合公报。对以上这些公报和声明，我国人民表示非常热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。因为这将更加有力地推进我国的经济发展，对我国社会主义建设事业将带来巨大的利益。
    公报中决定将苏联股份移交给我国的四个合股公司，就是在新疆境内的有色及稀有金属公司，石油公司，在大连的建造和修理轮船公司，以及中苏民航公司。这四个公司都是在一九五○年和一九五一年成立的。让我们回忆一下当时的处境吧！那时我国国民经济还没有恢复，由于交通不便和帝国主义的封锁，国内外贸易都还没有很大的发展，我们虽然接管了一批工矿企业，但还极其缺乏管理经验，在我们面前还摆着严重的资金和技术的困难。帝国主义者天天盼望着新生的中国倒下去；美国强盗指使蒋介石卖国集团不断袭击和轰炸上海。在那困难的岁月里，苏联政府慷慨地伸出手来，和我国合资开办了四大公司，全力支持了我国新生的经济。这是多么令人感动的友谊啊！
    这四个公司是新中国成立后新建和扩建的第一批社会主义企业。这些公司的成立，在我国建立了第一个稀有金属开采工业的基地，也大大提高了石油和造船工业的技术水平和生产能力，加强了我们祖国的心脏——北京和西北、东北边疆地区的联系。通过这些公司，几年来苏联为我国还培养和训练了一批新的建设人才。例如中苏石油公司，到去年十月为止，钻井生产比一九五一年增加六倍以上，原油产量增加了十八倍以上，培养了两千多优秀的技术人员和技术工人，比一九五○年全厂职工还多十三倍多。中苏民航公司，几年来发展了航线九千多公里，一九五○年到现在的运输量增加了三倍，并且训练了一批新的民航人员，建立了一套完整的科学管理制度。现在，当这一批企业正像满园瓜果正在长大、开花、结果的时候，苏联又将过去经营的股份全部移交我国，无私地使这批企业完全成为中华人民共和国的国营企业。这种无比深厚的友谊，在任何历史朝代任何国家之间，都是没有过的。这一切事实，深刻地教育了所有的中国人民，更清楚地认识了中苏两国的友好关系是与资本主义国家之间的关系在本质上是完全不同的。
    当我国迅速地结束了国民经济的恢复工作以后，从一九五三年开始进入了大规模的建设时期。我们的任务是要争取在几个五年计划之内，将原来在经济上文化上落后的国家，建设成为一个工业化的具有高度现代文化程度的伟大的社会主义国家。当然，实现这个任务是有很多困难的，克服这些困难不仅需要我们自己的努力，也需要国际朋友的援助和支持。在这个时期，我们特别得到了苏联的巨大无私的援助。在我国五年计划执行之初，苏联政府就慷慨地允诺帮助我国建设一百四十一项企业，这批企业，构成我国经济建设事业的骨干，它们建成后，将为我国国家工业化和国防现代化奠定巩固的基础。今天，在这个基础上，为了进一步促进我国经济建设的全面发展，苏联政府又决定帮助我国新建十五项工业企业和扩大一百四十一项企业的设备供应范围。这是苏联政府和人民又再次给了我们巨大的援助。
    苏联政府决定给予中国的其它经济和技术的援助，对我国的建设事业说来，是极其重要的。大家都知道，转眼我国就要进入五年计划的第三年，在第一个五年计划的最后的三年中，我们在基本建设方面的工作量最大，任务最繁重，工作也最紧张。今天苏联对我们的各项援助，将更有力地帮助我们克服困难，大大地推动我国各项建设的进度和保证建设任务的完成。兰州到阿拉木图、集宁到乌兰巴托铁路线的修建，不仅将加强我国内地与边疆地区的政治、经济、文化的联系，进一步巩固各民族的团结，也将进一步加强中苏蒙三国之间，以及中国和欧洲各人民民主国家之间的经济和文化联系。
    “苏联政府代表团关于苏联人民赠送机器和装备给中国人民以组织大型国营谷物农场的声明”，对我国也有着十分重要的意义。大家都知道，我国农业生产目前最突出的问题，就是一方面人口多耕地少，另一方面却还有大约十亿亩的可耕地没有开垦。这是由于目前国家还没有足够的资金，由于我国的工业还不能大批生产开垦荒地的机械，以及我们还缺乏大规模组织开荒的经验。但是在一定时期以后，必须大大发展这一事业，这是扩大农业生产的根本办法之一。正在这个时候，苏联赠送大批机器，并派遣专家帮助我们组织一个大规模的国营农场，对我国说来，乃是一项特别需要和十分适时的措施。这个高度机械化的以谷物生产为主的农场的建立，不仅可以系统地把苏联开垦荒地所积累起来的经验介绍给我国，而且也会为我国训练干部、作出榜样，提高我国农业生产技术，推动我国现有国营农场进一步提高管理与生产水平，并为今后大量开垦荒地积累经验。
    从以上各项公报和声明中，从这些友谊的行动中，我国人民再一次深刻地体会到苏联人民永远是我们最可靠和最忠实的朋友。在我们沿着社会主义的道路前进的时候，永远都会得到苏联政府和人民的友好合作和积极支持。这是一种兄弟般的真正友好的和真正建设性的援助，它是建立在互相帮助和促进共同进步和繁荣的基础上的。我国人民，特别是经济工作部门的人员，都应该十分珍重苏联对我国的援助，应该很好地巩固已有的成就，运用和发挥苏联给予我国的物质、技术的新的援助，加速我国国家的经济建设。
    目前摆在我们面前的重要任务，就是要坚决地巩固四个公司已获得的成就，并迅速组织力量作好一个国营农场和两条铁路线路的建设工作。在这些工作中，重工业部、燃料工业部、第一机械工业部、铁道部、农业部和民航局负有特别重要的责任，必须把它摆在日常工作的重要日程中去。应该认识到，以上这些已经建立和准备建立的企业，都是根据苏联先进经验进行工作的，办好这些企业，并通过这些企业的示范作用，就可以带动更多的企业前进，可以使我们少走许多弯路而迅速地推动国民经济的全面高涨。这个道理，已经为中长铁路的经验所证实了。因此，各个经济部门应该认真地系统地整理和传播各单位推行苏联经验的经验，并以此作为一项重要任务。
    我们衷心感谢苏联政府和人民对我国建设事业的深切关怀和援助，我们深信，在苏联的援助和我们自己的努力下，我们一定能够迅速地把国家建设事业推向前进，争取我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的更大的成功。
