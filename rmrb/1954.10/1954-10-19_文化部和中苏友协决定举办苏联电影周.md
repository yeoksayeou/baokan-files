Xinhua News Agency, 17th. To celebrate the 37th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, consolidate and develop the incomparably profound great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and further strengthen cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have decided to jointly hold "Soviet Film Week."

    The Film Week will be held in eighteen cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, Hohhot, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanning, Chongqing, Kunming, Xi'an, and Urumqi for ten days starting from November 7th—the anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution; it will be held in twelve cities including Changchun, Qiqihar, Fushun, Taiyuan, Jinan, Fuzhou, Hefei, Changsha, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, and Lanzhou for seven to ten days starting from November 15th. During the Film Week, five new Soviet films will be screened—the color feature films: "Mountain Outpost," "Black Boy (Maximka)," "Harvest (The Return of Vasily Bortnikov)," "Dawn on the Neman River," and the color animation "Soviet Color Animation Film Fourth Collection."

    "Mountain Outpost" depicts the story of Soviet border guards bravely defending the peaceful construction of the motherland. It truthfully reflects the life of the heroic border guards at Soviet border outposts. The film successfully expresses the patriotic feelings and brave, tenacious spirit of the Soviet people, convincingly showing that no matter how insidious and cunning the imperialists are, they are bound to suffer a shameful defeat.

    "Black Boy (Maximka)" is adapted from the novel "Marine Stories" by the Russian writer Stanyukovich. It demonstrates the Russian people's justice, kindness, respect for all races, and opposition to racial discrimination and enslavement, embodying the spirit of humanism; at the same time, it exposes the barbarity and crimes of the American slave trade, killing, and mistreating black people.

    "Harvest (The Return of Vasily Bortnikov)" is adapted from the long novel "Harvest" by the Soviet female writer Nikolaeva. It depicts how a Soviet collective farm transforms from backwardness to prosperity after the war. The film successfully portrays the growth of the advanced Soviet people engaged in peaceful labor and the new relationships between them.

    "Dawn on the Neman River" is about the struggle of Lithuanian collective farmers for the further development of agricultural collectivization.

    "Soviet Color Animation Film Fourth Collection" consists of five color animated films: "A Little Red Flower," "The Wonderful Shop," "The Disguised Fox," "The Disobedient Kitten," and "The Crow and the Fox, the Cuckoo and the Rooster." These films showcase the outstanding achievements of Soviet color animation art.

    【新华社十七日讯】为庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十七周年，巩固和发展中苏两国人民的无比深厚的伟大友谊，进一步加强中苏两国之间的文化交流，中华人民共和国文化部、中苏友好协会总会决定联合举办“苏联电影周”。
    电影周自十一月七日——伟大十月社会主义革命节起，在北京、天津、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、鞍山、旅大、呼和浩特、杭州、南京、青岛、武汉、广州、南宁、重庆、昆明、西安、乌鲁木齐等十八个城市举行十天；自十一月十五日起在长春、齐齐哈尔、抚顺、太原、济南、福州、合肥、长沙、南昌、郑州、成都、兰州等十二个城市举行七至十天。电影周期间，将放映五部苏联新片——彩色故事片：“山中防哨”、“黑孩子（马克西姆卡）”、“收获（华西里·波尔特尼可夫的归来）”、“尼门河上的黎明”和彩色动画片“苏联彩色动画片第四集”。
    “山中防哨”是描写苏联边防军战士英勇地保卫祖国和平建设的故事。它真实地反映了苏联边防哨所上英勇的边防军战士的生活。影片成功地表达出了苏联人民的爱国主义感情和勇敢、顽强的精神，令人信服地表明无论帝国主义者多么阴险、狡猾，也都必然要遭到可耻的失败。
    “黑孩子（马克西姆卡）”是根据俄国作家斯塔纽科维奇的小说“海洋故事”改编的。它表现了俄罗斯人民公正、仁慈、尊重一切种族，反对种族歧视、奴役的人道主义精神；同时，也揭露了美国贩卖黑人、戕杀、虐待黑人的野蛮和罪恶。
      “收获（华西里·波尔特尼可夫的归来）”是根据苏联女作家尼古拉耶娃的长篇小说“收获”改编的。它描写苏联战后的一个集体农庄如何从落后走向繁荣，影片成功的表现了从事和平劳动的先进的苏维埃人的成长以及他们之间的新的关系。
      “尼门河上的黎明”是写立陶宛集体农民为农业集体化的进一步发展的斗争。
    “苏联彩色动画片第四集”是由“一朵小红花”、“奇妙的商店”、“伪装的狐狸”、“不听话的小猫”、“乌鸦与狐狸、布谷鸟与公鸡”等五个彩色动画片组成。这些影片显示了苏联彩色动画片艺术的卓越成就。
