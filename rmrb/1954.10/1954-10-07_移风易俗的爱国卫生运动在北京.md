    Patriotic Health Campaign Transforms Customs in Beijing
    National People's Congress Representative
    Vice Mayor of Beijing Municipality Wu Han
    China's great capital, Beijing, before liberation, although once called the "Cultural Capital," did not allow the laboring people to enjoy cultural life. The reactionary ruling class consistently ignored the people's health, and the city's sanitation conditions were very backward. The few modern urban sanitation facilities such as sewers and tap water, and even the limited number of asphalt roads, were almost all concentrated in the residential areas of the reactionary ruling class and the wealthy, serving only a few of them. The residential areas of the broad masses of the laboring people had very few, or none at all.

    For example, Erlong Road in the Western District. During the Japanese occupation, this road was originally called Erlong Pit, and it was as notoriously dirty as Longxu Ditch in the Southern District. Everywhere there were potholes, and the terrain was low, so when it rained, the surrounding rainwater would flow there, flooding the houses to a depth of half a foot. There was an open ditch beside the road, where people would throw dead cats and dead rats, and pour excrement and urine, making it truly stink to high heaven. In summer, mosquitoes would bite people until they were covered in red welts, and flies would buzz around until people were dizzy. Because there were no sewers, people would pour dirty water into the streets, and in winter, the road surface would freeze, causing anyone who wasn't careful to slip and fall. When the Kuomintang reactionaries came to take over, they made a "grand decision" to rename Erlong Pit as Erlong Road, and they talked loudly about hygiene, collecting donations and adding taxes, but there was no sign of anyone repairing the road. Before long, the place became a garbage dump, with garbage piled up more than ten feet high, like a mountain. People called it Erlong Mountain, and when it rained, it became Erlong River. It was not until after liberation that the Municipal People's Government built an asphalt road, installed sewers, and built buildings, that Erlong Road was truly called Erlong Road.

    The above is just a very common example. Before liberation, there were many places in the city where garbage piled up like mountains, and foul water and mud flooded everywhere. Many open ditches, reed ponds, and depressions emitted foul odors and bred mosquitoes, flies, and bacteria. The broad masses of laboring people lived in such a filthy environment for a long time, and sanitation conditions were extremely poor. At the same time, in the old society, the broad masses of laboring people, suffering from poverty and hunger and living in the abyss of suffering, were also deprived of the opportunity to receive education, so they lacked scientific hygiene knowledge and habits, and there was no way to talk about paying attention to hygiene. The culture of the "Cultural Capital" was very little for the laboring people. People hated this phenomenon and were dissatisfied with this environment.

    Since liberation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has put forward the urban construction policy of "serving production, serving the laboring people, and serving the central government," and has vigorously carried out the transformation and construction of urban sanitation facilities. Rivers and lakes have been dredged, many new sewers and roads have been built, and the dirt roads in the hutongs have also been repaired. The health administration departments have launched health and epidemic prevention campaigns over the years. Therefore, the environmental sanitation of the capital has been significantly improved, but to fundamentally change this situation, truly change customs, and make everyone pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, a large-scale, city-wide mass patriotic health campaign is indispensable.

    In March 1952, the people of Beijing responded to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and in the angry tide against the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism, a large-scale mass patriotic health campaign was launched, giving full play to the wisdom and strength of the people. The breadth and depth of the campaign, and the great achievements it achieved, were unprecedented in the history of sanitation work in the capital.

    After the patriotic health campaign was fully launched, in 1952, the Municipal People's Government continued to dredge the lower reaches of Longxu Ditch, changing the open ditch into a covered drain. It also excavated the reed ponds and depressions of Taoranting and Longtan, filled in the stagnant pools of the city and suburbs, and eliminated the major breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. At the same time, it continuously mobilized the masses to carry out three fairly widespread and thorough clean-up campaigns. Every household cleared away the garbage and filth accumulated over the years. Among them was the 40-year accumulation of dust and filth in the "Xu Zhuangyuan Mansion" in Suzhou Hutong, Dongdan District, and the remote garbage accumulated since the Ming Dynasty in the non-tourist areas of the Forbidden City, totaling more than 115,000 cubic meters.

    Many large courtyards where laboring people lived, such as the Wanfo Temple Courtyard in Qianmen District and the Fahua Temple Courtyard in Dongdan District, had long been filthy and unbearable, and many residents were sick. Through the patriotic health campaign, the ideological awareness and health knowledge of the people were improved, the unity among the residents was strengthened, and regular cleaning and sweeping work was maintained. Now, they have become model sanitary courtyards.

    The people also carried out a campaign to exterminate rats, flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, fleas, and lice, and achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics, in 1952 alone, more than 1.85 million rats were caught in the city, and the masses created and imitated more than 60 kinds of rat-catching tools.

    In recent years, every summer and autumn, the people of the capital have launched a wave of exterminating mosquitoes and flies. Everyone knows that doing a good job of turning over pots and emptying cans, blocking tree holes, clearing stagnant water, and cleaning the environment are important ways to prevent mosquitoes and flies from breeding. The masses have also created dozens of methods to exterminate mosquitoes and flies. At present, the habit of swatting mosquitoes and flies has gradually been cultivated among the people, and many areas in the city have achieved "no mosquitoes and flies indoors, no mosquito larvae in the courtyard, and no maggots in the toilets."

    Employees in the catering industry have paid attention to personal hygiene and food hygiene, realizing that this is related to the health of the broad masses of the people. Most employees have automatically put on white work clothes and are able to disinfect eating utensils and keep food clean, basically overcoming backward ideas such as "frogs in the well, maggots in the sauce, can't be avoided" that did not emphasize hygiene. For example, the famous Tianqiao Market, a place most liked by urban and rural laboring people to stroll around, with the most small food stalls, used to be very unclean, and most likely to spread diseases. Now, from spring and summer to autumn and winter, whether it is a wonton stall, a douzhi stall, a qiegao stall, a baodu stall, etc., no small food stall is without a glass cover or a gauze cover. The small dining tables and eating utensils are also clean. These small vendors have also developed good personal hygiene habits. General food shops and fish and meat markets have also established industry hygiene organizations, implemented democratic management, and regularly conduct hygiene inspections.

    Street residents have implemented a regular cleaning system—the area responsibility system. Under long-term education and persistence, "sweeping the courtyard" has become a daily habit of the people. Many residents have included doing a good job in hygiene as an important part of their patriotic covenants. These methods have promoted the development of the patriotic health campaign to varying degrees and consolidated its results.

    In recent years, Beijing's patriotic health campaign, based on the specific requirements of the broad masses of laboring people in the city in terms of health and epidemic prevention, has been closely combined with the needs of production, effectively reducing the prevalence of diseases, enhancing the health of the people, and thus protecting the labor force.

    Carrying out the patriotic health campaign in factories and mines has changed the face of environmental sanitation in these areas, improved the health level of the workers, reduced diseases, and increased attendance rates, thereby ensuring the normal progress of the production and construction undertaking.

    After the launch of the patriotic health campaign on construction sites, the incidence of illness among workers was reduced, and the workers' enthusiasm for production was increased. On some construction sites where the patriotic health campaign was carried out better, the workers' attendance rate was as high as 99% or more. All of this played an important role in the successful and over-fulfilled completion of the capital's arduous construction engineering tasks.

    Patriotic health campaigns have been carried out within state organs, people's organizations, and schools. Most people have been able to pay attention to hygiene, and their health has improved to some extent.

    In the rural areas of the suburbs, combined with agricultural production work such as accumulating manure and applying fertilizer, sanitation conditions have also changed.

    Due to the improvement of people's living standards, the continuous improvement of sanitation conditions, and the development of the patriotic health campaign, the diseases of the people have been reduced, and the mortality rate of the urban population has gradually decreased: the population mortality rate in 1951 was 12.74 per thousand, and in 1953 it had dropped to 9.31 per thousand. Before liberation, the infant mortality rate was over 100 per thousand, in 1951 it was reduced to 86.6 per thousand, and in 1953 it was further reduced to 59.3 per thousand.

    Through the patriotic health campaign, not only has the level of scientific health knowledge of the broad masses of the people been universally improved, but also the old customs and habits of the people have been greatly changed. Superstitious and backward ideas such as "rats are the god of wealth," "don't sweep the house until the twelfth lunar month," and "being unclean doesn't make you sick" have been basically eliminated. Paying attention to personal hygiene and public hygiene has become a new social morality and new atmosphere.

    The new look of cleanliness and hygiene in the capital not only makes the people of the capital happy, but also makes the people from all regions who come to Beijing happy. Through the patriotic health campaign, it has once again eloquently proved the unparalleled superiority of the people's democratic system, proving that the liberated Chinese people can use their own hands, give full play to their diligence, courage, and wisdom, and build and transform their country at extremely high speed.

    For more than two years, the people of the capital have deeply realized that doing a good job in patriotic health work is not a matter of one morning or one evening, but a long-term and arduous task. Everyone knows that doing a good job in hygiene, reducing diseases, and strengthening the body is an important condition for improving production, work, and learning efficiency.

    The people of Beijing are full of victorious confidence, and together with the people of the whole country, under the bright banner of building socialism, they will never be satisfied with the initial achievements of the past. They will further improve the level of the patriotic health campaign, and strive to strengthen the construction of the people's health undertaking, and strive for the peaceful and happy life of our people!

    移风易俗的爱国卫生运动在北京
    全国人民代表大会代表
    北京市人民政府副市长  吴晗
    中国人民的伟大首都——北京，在解放前，虽然也曾被称为“文化故都”，但是劳动人民并没有享受文化生活的权利。历来反动统治阶级一贯漠视人民的健康，城市卫生条件非常落后，仅有的一些下水道、自来水等现代化的城市卫生设施，以至有限的几条沥青马路，几乎全部集中在反动统治阶级及富豪们的居住地区，为他们少数人服务。广大劳动人民的居住地区则极其少有，或者根本没有。
    例如：西城的二龙路。在日本占领时期，这条路原来叫做二龙坑，和南城的龙须沟一样脏得出名。到处都是坑洼，地势又低，下了雨，四周的雨水就都流到这儿，水漫到屋里有半尺深；路旁有一条明沟，人们都往里面扔死猫、死耗子，倒屎、倒尿，真是臭气冲天。夏天，蚊子叮得人混身红肿，苍蝇闹得人头晕脑胀。因为没有下水道，人们就往街上泼脏水，到了冬天，路面上结了一层冰，谁要不留神就滑一交。国民党反动派来接收了，他们下了个“大决心”，把二龙坑改名叫二龙路，口口声声要人讲卫生，收捐加税，却看不见修马路的人影。不久以后，此地变成了垃圾堆，垃圾堆得有一丈多高，像一座山，人们管它叫二龙山，下雨天就叫成了二龙河。直到解放后，才由市人民政府把这条路修成了沥青马路，安装了下水道，盖上了楼房，二龙路才真正被叫做二龙路了。
    上面所说的，只不过是一个很普通的例子。解放前，在全市有很多地方，都是垃圾成山，臭水污泥泛滥各处，很多明沟、苇塘和洼地，大量地发散着臭气，孳生着蚊子、苍蝇和细菌。广大劳动人民长期痛苦地生活在这样一个污秽的环境里，卫生条件极差。同时，在旧社会，广大的劳动人民既然忍受着贫困和饥饿，生活在痛苦的深渊里，又被剥夺了受教育的机会，所以很缺乏科学卫生的知识和习惯，根本谈不上如何讲究卫生。“文化故都”的文化，对劳动人民来说是很少很少的，人们痛恨这样的现象，不满意这样的环境。
    解放以来，北京市人民政府提出了“为生产服务，为劳动人民服务，为中央服务”的城市建设方针，大力进行了城市卫生设施的改造和新建工作，疏浚了河湖，新建了不少上、下水道和马路，胡同的土路也整修了。卫生行政部门历年来都开展了卫生防疫运动，因此首都的环境卫生状况，有了显著的改进，但是要根本改变这种面貌，真正做到移风易俗，使人人讲究清洁卫生，没有一个大规模的全市范围的群众性的爱国卫生运动，是不可能的。
    一九五二年三月，北京人民响应了毛主席和中央人民政府的伟大号召，在反对美国帝国主义细菌战的怒潮中，轰轰烈烈地展开了大规模群众性的爱国卫生运动，发挥了人民群众的智慧和力量，范围的广泛和深入，获得成绩之大，在首都卫生工作的历史上是空前的。
    爱国卫生运动全面展开以后，在一九五二年中，市人民政府一面继续疏浚龙须沟下游，改明沟为暗沟；掏挖了陶然亭和龙潭的苇塘洼地，填垫了城、厢的死水潭，消灭了蚊蝇孳生的大本营。同时，连续发动群众进行了三次相当普遍彻底的清洁大扫除工作，家家户户清除了多年来遗留下来的垃圾和秽土，其中有东单区苏州胡同“徐状元府”积存四十年的尘埃秽土，有故宫非游览区包括从明朝就积留下来的、总量达十一万五千余公方的远年垃圾。
    许多劳动人民聚居的大杂院，如前门区的万佛寺大院、东单区的法华寺大院等，长期污秽不堪，居民得病的很多，通过爱国卫生运动，提高了人民群众的思想觉悟和卫生知识水平，加强了住户之间的团结，保持了经常的清洁扫除工作，现在，已成为卫生模范大院了。
    人民群众还进行了扑灭老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子、臭虫、跳蚤和虱子的运动，取得了很大的成绩。根据不完全统计，仅在一九五二年，全市即捕了一百八十五万多只老鼠，群众创造和仿制了六十多种捕鼠工具。
    几年来，每逢夏秋季节，首都人民就掀起了扑灭蚊子、苍蝇的热潮，大家都知道做好翻盆倒罐、堵塞树洞、清除积水和环境清洁的工作，是防止蚊子、苍蝇孳生的重要方法。群众还创造了数十种扑灭蚊、蝇的方法。目前扑打蚊蝇的习惯，已在人民群众中逐步养成，全市不少地区已经做到“室内无蚊蝇、院内无孑孓、厕所无蛆蛹”了。
    饮食行业的职工重视了个人卫生和饮食品卫生，了解到这是关系到广大人民健康的事情。大多数职工自动换上了白色工作服，都能够对食具进行消毒，保持食品的清洁，基本上克服了“井里的蛤蟆、酱里的蛆，免不了”等不讲卫生的落后思想。例如著名的天桥市场，是一个为城乡劳动人民最喜欢游逛的、小食摊最多的场所，从前，这些小食摊很不清洁，最易传染疾病，现在从春夏到秋冬，无论是馄饨摊、豆汁摊、切糕摊、爆肚摊等，没有一个小食摊没有玻璃罩、纱罩；小餐桌、食具也都是干干净净的，这些小摊贩还养成了良好的个人卫生习惯。一般饮食店铺和鱼肉市场并建立了行业卫生组织，实行了民主管理，经常进行卫生检查。
    街道居民执行了经常的保持清洁制度——地段责任制，在长期的教育和坚持下，“洒扫庭除”已经成为人民群众的日常生活习惯。许多居民把做好卫生工作订为爱国公约的重要内容，这些办法都在不同程度上推动了爱国卫生运动的发展，并巩固了它的成果。
    这几年来，北京的爱国卫生运动，根据本市广大劳动人民在卫生防疫方面的具体要求，密切结合了生产的需要，有效地减少了疾病的流行，增进了人民的健康，从而保护了劳动力。
    在工厂和矿山开展了爱国卫生运动，改变了这些地区环境卫生的面貌，提高了工人群众的健康水平，疾病减少了，出勤率提高了，从而保证了生产建设事业的正常进行。
    建筑工地开展爱国卫生运动后，降低了工人的发病率，提高了工人的生产热情，有些爱国卫生运动进行得较好的建筑工地，工人出勤率高达百分之九十九以上。所有这些，对首都艰巨的建筑工程任务得以胜利地超额地完成，是起了重要的作用的。
    在国家机关、人民团体和学校内部进行了爱国卫生运动，大多数人由于能够讲究卫生，身体健康的情况已有所提高。
    在郊区农村，结合积肥、施肥等农业生产工作，卫生状况也有了改变。
    由于人民生活水平的提高，卫生条件的不断改善，爱国卫生运动的展开，人民群众的疾病减少了，城市人口的死亡率也逐步降低了：一九五一年的人口死亡率是千分之十二点七四，一九五三年已降低到千分之九点三一。解放前婴儿死亡率在千分之一百以上，一九五一年降低为千分之八十六点六，一九五三年更降为千分之五十九点三。
    通过爱国卫生运动，不仅普遍提高了广大人民群众的科学卫生知识水平，而且极大地改变了人民的旧的风俗习惯。“老鼠是财神”、“不到腊月不扫房”、“不干不净，吃了没病”等迷信落后的思想，已经基本上得到清除。讲究个人卫生和公共卫生，已形成为社会上的一种新道德新风气。
    首都清洁卫生的新面貌，不仅首都人民群众感觉高兴，也使各地区来京的人民群众感觉高兴。通过爱国卫生运动，又一次雄辩地证明了人民民主制度无比的优越性，证明了解放了的中国人民，能够用自己的双手，发挥勤劳、勇敢和智慧，以极高的速度，来建设和改造自己的国家。
    两年多以来，首都人民都深刻体会到做好爱国卫生工作并不是一朝一夕的事情，是一项长时期的艰巨的任务。大家都知道搞好卫生，减少疾病，增强体魄，是提高生产、工作和学习效率的一个重要的条件。
    北京人民充满着胜利的信心，和全国人民一道，在建设社会主义事业的光辉旗帜下，决不满足于过去初步的成就，要把爱国卫生运动的水平更加提高一步，为加强人民卫生事业的建设，为争取我们人民和平幸福的生活而奋斗！
