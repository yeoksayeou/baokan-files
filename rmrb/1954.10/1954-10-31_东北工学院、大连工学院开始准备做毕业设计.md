    Northeastern Institute of Technology and Dalian Institute of Technology have begun preparations for graduation projects. This year, these two institutes have a large number of graduating students, and the scope of graduation projects is also extensive. More than 1,100 students at Northeastern Institute of Technology are undertaking graduation projects, more than three times the number from last year. Every student this academic year will have the opportunity to apply their theoretical and practical knowledge to complete a design.
    Currently, both institutes have assigned specialized teachers to guide graduation projects. Graduation guidance groups have been formed in various teaching and research groups and departments. Research on the scale and methods of graduation projects, as well as graduation project topics, is underway. Hu Guodong, head of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Dalian Institute of Technology, contacted Harbin Institute of Technology and design institutions of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry in Shenyang in late September. They clarified that students should adopt advanced technological measures and select the latest machine tools, cutting tools, and measurement methods in their graduation projects. Therefore, the general goal should be to design a mechanical processing workshop with high output and new production methods. The teaching and research sections of each specialty in the Chemical Engineering Department have also contacted relevant chemical plants, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. According to the contact agreement, the Chemical Machinery teaching and research section will obtain various design topics and related materials from Dalian Alkali Plant.
    Many teachers will conduct a trial graduation design beforehand to gain experience before guiding students. Nearly sixty teachers at Dalian Institute of Technology will conduct trial graduation designs this year. Some teachers from the teaching and research sections of various specialties in the Civil Engineering Department have already begun trial runs based on materials from the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China, starting from October 8th. Zheng Ping, a lecturer in the Mechanical Engineering Department, has begun designing a mechanical processing workshop. Teachers in the Traction Teaching and Research Group of the Electromechanical Department of Northeastern Institute of Technology have decided to work on nine topics such as rolling mills, electric shovels, and hot saws. They have already preliminarily collected materials and formulated internship plans for going to factories. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北工学院、大连工学院开始准备做毕业设计
    东北工学院、大连工学院已着手做毕业设计的准备工作。今年这两个学院本届毕业生很多，做毕业设计的范围也大。东北工学院做毕业设计的学生有一千一百多人，比去年增加了三倍多。这些学生本学年每人都有机会运用他们所掌握的理论知识和实际知识做出一份设计来。
    现在，两学院都指定了专门指导毕业设计的教师。在各个教研组和教研室里组成了毕业指导小组。正展开对毕业设计的规模、做法和毕业设计的题目的研究。大连工学院机械系系主任胡国栋等，在九月下旬就和哈尔滨工业大学、中华人民共和国第一机械工业部在沈阳的设计机构联系。他们明确了在毕业设计中，应该使学生采取先进的工艺措施，选用最新机床、刀具和度量方法。因此，一般应设计一个产量大，生产方式新的机械加工车间。化工系各专业教研室也分别和有关化工厂、鞍山钢铁公司和石景山钢铁厂等取得联系。化工机械教研室根据联系合同，将获得大连碱厂的各个设计题目和有关资料。
    许多教师将事先试做一次毕业设计，以便取得经验后再去指导学生。大连工学院今年试做毕业设计的教师将近六十名。土木系各专业教研室的部分教师，从十月八日起已经根据中华人民共和国燃料工业部和水利部的资料开始试做。机械系讲师郑平已开始作一种机械加工车间的设计。东北工学院机电系拖动教研组的教师，已经决定好做轧钢机、电铲、热锯等九个题目。目前已经初步收集了资料，制订了下工厂的实习计划。　（新华社）
