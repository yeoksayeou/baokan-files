Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd: TASS reports from New York on the 1st: Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, wrote a letter to Mr. Van Kleffens, President of the United Nations General Assembly, advocating that the item "Infringement on Freedom of Navigation on China's Seas" be included on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. The full text of the letter is as follows: Dear Mr. President:
	I have the honor to request that you include the item "Infringement on Freedom of Navigation on China's Seas" as an important and urgent issue on the agenda of the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
	In accordance with Rule 20 of the Rules of Procedure, I have made a statement on this issue.
		Respectfully yours, Head of the Soviet Delegation, Vyshinsky, September 30, 1954. Statement on Infringement on Freedom of Navigation on China's Seas Recently, Kuomintang warships have been carrying out pirate actions in the seas off China, attacking and seizing merchant ships of various countries more and more frequently. The Soviet tanker "Tuapse," which was seized by Chiang Kai-shek elements on June 23 this year and has not been released to this day, is a victim of this kind of criminal act, and according to available information, the crew members of this Soviet tanker have been subjected to severe violence.
	Another example of this kind of crime is the seizure of the Polish merchant ship "President Gottwald" by the Kuomintang Navy on May 13 this year, and the seizure of the "Praca" on October 4, 1953.
	Chiang Kai-shek elements have also carried out pirate actions against merchant ships of Denmark, Britain, and other countries.
	These actions seriously infringe on the universally recognized principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas and constitute a crime. The United Nations General Assembly must condemn these actions. Not only Chiang Kai-shek elements, but also those who instigate them, should be held responsible for these actions.
	The Soviet delegation believes that, based on the above facts, there are reasons to include this important and urgent issue as a new item on the agenda of the General Assembly.

    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基写信给联大主席
    要求把侵犯中国海面航行自由问题列入议程
    【新华社三日讯】　据塔斯社纽约一日讯：苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基写给联合国大会第九届会议主席范克里芬斯一封信，主张把“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”这个项目列入联合国大会议程。这封信的全文如下：敬爱的主席先生：
    我很荣幸地请求您把“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”这个项目，作为一个重要的和迫切的问题，列入联合国大会第九届会议的议程。
    根据议事规则第二十条，我对这个问题作了一个说明。
        尊敬您的苏联代表团团长维辛斯基一九五四年九月三十日关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由的说明最近，国民党军舰在中国海面采取海盗行动，袭击并劫走各国商船的事件越来越多了。蒋介石分子在今年六月二十三日劫走的、并且直到今天还没有释放的苏联油船“图阿普斯号”就是这种罪恶行动的牺牲品，而且根据现有的消息，这艘苏联油船的船员们受到严重的暴力的对待。
    另一个这种罪行的例子是，国民党海军今年五月十三日劫走波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德总统号”，一九五三年十月四日劫走“布拉卡号”。
    蒋介石分子还对丹麦、英国及其他国家的商船采取了海盗行动。
    这些行动严重侵犯了公认的公海航行自由的原则，并构成一种罪行。联合国大会对这种行动必须予以谴责。不仅是蒋介石分子，而且还有唆使他们的人，都应对这些行动负责。
    苏联代表团认为，根据以上事实，有理由把这个重要而迫切的问题作为新的项目列入大会议程。
