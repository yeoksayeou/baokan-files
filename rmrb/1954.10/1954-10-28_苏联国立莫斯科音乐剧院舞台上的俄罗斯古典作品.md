Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko dedicated most of their activities to the reform of the opera theater. They strived to establish realistic performances on the opera stage so that the general audience could understand and enjoy the art of opera.

Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko laid the foundation for a new type of opera school for singing actors. They viewed opera art as a convergence of three arts possessed by singers—musical, vocal, and stage performance—for the same goal: artistic truth and the vitality of operatic images.

In the reform of opera, Stanislavsky first focused on outstanding creations of Russian classical opera. The first repertoire that laid the foundation for the new opera house was Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin." This repertoire, performed by the young troupe in the school auditorium, was loved for its emotional depth, actors' sincere performances, and genuine feelings. It showed Pushkin's vivid and poetic images on the stage.

Tchaikovsky hailed "Eugene Onegin" as a "lyrical opera," and he envisioned performing his opera in this way. When Tchaikovsky handed over his "Eugene Onegin" to be performed in the small theater of the conservatory, he wrote that for the roles of Onegin, Tatyana, and Lensky, it would be better to have conservatory students play them rather than opera singers: "Because they are students, they are young, and they will not have those detestable, stale conventions. For my new opera, what I fear most is these things." Stanislavsky's views were completely in line with Tchaikovsky's wishes.

In 1930, Stanislavsky performed another work by the genius composer—the opera "The Queen of Spades." He helped the theater create an exceptionally authentic and realistic repertoire, embodying Tchaikovsky's genius creation.

Stanislavsky also staged Rimsky-Korsakov's works more than once. These creations drove him to seek new paths and techniques for creating stage images. The works that were staged included: "The Tsar's Bride," "May Night," and "The Golden Cockerel."

The opera "The Tsar's Bride" has a profound national flavor and reveals the characteristics of the Russian character. Stanislavsky was very familiar with history and ancient Russian life, and he strived to show in this work how social and family life produced people's behavior and psychology. The staging of this opera confirmed that the new principles of creating musical theater stood the test not only in small operas but also in grand operas.

In 1932, Stanislavsky wrote: "The problem lies in turning a costumed concert into a real theatrical performance. Most operas are currently this kind of costumed concert. Therefore, it is necessary to point out that, in my opinion, there is no reason to divide opera into singing opera and musical theater, because every opera is musical theater."

The performance of "May Night" was a continuation of the work of rehearsing Rimsky-Korsakov's operas. The music of "May Night" is built on the tunes of Ukrainian folk music. The lyrical and humorous elements in this opera were reproduced and sung in new ways. All the characteristics of Ukrainian rural customs were expressed. The beauty of the music enabled the young troupe to create this lively and joyful repertoire.

Stanislavsky also staged fairy tale operas. In his performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Golden Cockerel," he injected great creativity and exceptionally rich imagination. This opera was written by the composer under the influence of the 1905 revolutionary events. This opera expressed satire of the autocratic system and sharply pointed out the foolishness, laziness, and tyranny of the Dodon empire.

Stanislavsky also began rehearsing Pushkin's drama—Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov," which was a major event in the theater's creative life. The opera was staged based on the original script compiled by Professor Lamm, the expert most familiar with Mussorgsky. Stanislavsky profoundly expressed this work by Pushkin-Mussorgsky. In this work, the living, actively acting people occupy the primary position. From the first scene near the Novodevichy Monastery to the last scene of the opera, Boris's lonely death, the gap between the Tsar and the people is emphasized.

Mussorgsky's creations were equally close to both Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko. In 1932, the Musical Theater established by Nemirovich-Danchenko staged Mussorgsky's opera "Sorochintsy Fair." This opera did not have a complete and coherent script, only some fragments. Professor Lamm and composer Shebalin worked together to do a great deal of work, re-staging this opera as Mussorgsky had envisioned. Mussorgsky saw Gogol's deepest realism, and the theater brought Mussorgsky's music and the vivid techniques and living characteristics expressed in Gogol's novel to the stage.

The work of staging classical works by Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko is of great significance in establishing realism on the opera stage; at the same time, it is also a very important and serious preparation for embodying modern plays on the musical theater stage.

The principles of creating realistic opera announced by Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko have given a tremendous influence to all modern opera art, not only in the Soviet Union but also abroad. This idea has become the foundation of the work of the Soviet national musical theater and the schools for training opera actors and directors.

Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko cultivated an entire generation of Soviet opera actors. Many of them started their creative activities from the birth of the theater and became masters of opera art. In the repertoire that the theater is about to perform for the Chinese audience, young people and famous, experienced actors—Kangjieraki, Yanko, Panchesin, Cai Ning, Smirnova-Nemirovich, Knitsky, Korotkov, Kuznetsova, Vasilyeva, and others—are conducting close creative cooperation. The broad road to art has been opened up for young people. Young actors Potapovskaya, Dudarev, Braslis, Borisova, Shavunsky, Matveyev, Lakiyevsky, Lasarinko, Berevzova, and others have already occupied important positions in the theater. For them and for their young comrades, all the conditions have been created to enable them to make creative progress and improvement. Their activities rely on the experience of the old comrades, on the direct students of Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko.

When the theater performs in the People's Republic of China, it will stage "Eugene Onegin," the repertoire in which we have achieved the most outstanding results in performing classical operas.

    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科把他们的活动的大部分都献给了歌剧剧院的改革。他们力求在歌剧的舞台上确立现实主义的演出，使广大观众能够理解和享受到歌剧艺术。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科奠定了一个新型歌唱演员的歌剧学校的基础。他们把歌剧艺术看做是歌唱者所具备的、为了同一目标的三种艺术——音乐的、声乐的、舞台表演的——的汇合。这个目标就是艺术的真实、歌剧形象的生命力。
    在歌剧的改革工作中，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基首先着手的是俄罗斯古典歌剧的优秀创作。奠定了新歌剧院基础的第一个剧目，就是柴可夫斯基的“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”。年青的剧团在学校小礼堂中上演的这个剧目，以感情的深刻、演员表演的真挚和感受的真诚而使人喜爱。它在舞台上表现出普希金的生动的富有诗意的形象。
    柴可夫斯基曾把“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”誉为“抒情剧”，他所幻想的正是这样来演出自己的歌剧。柴可夫斯基把他的“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”交给音乐学院的小剧场上演时，他写道，对于奥涅金、妲姬雅娜、连斯基的角色，宁可让音乐学院的学生扮演而不让歌剧的歌手来演：“因为他们是学生，是青年，他们不会有那种可厌的、陈腐的惯例。对于我的新歌剧来说，我最怕的就是这些东西。”斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的观点和柴可夫斯基的这些愿望是完全符合的。
    一九三○年，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基又演出了天才作曲家的另一个作品——歌剧“黑桃皇后”。他帮助剧院创造了异常真实的、现实主义的剧目，体现了柴可夫斯基的天才创作。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基也不止一次地上演过李姆斯基—科萨可夫的创作。这些创作推动他去寻求创造舞台形象的新途径和新手法。曾经上演过的有：“沙皇的新娘”，“五月之夜”和“金鸡”。
    歌剧“沙皇的新娘”具有深刻的民族风味，并揭示出俄罗斯性格的特点。斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基非常熟习历史和俄罗斯的古代情况，他力求在这个作品中表现出：社会生活和家庭生活的方式怎样产生了人们的行为和心理。这个剧的上演证实了：创作音乐剧的新原则不仅在小型歌剧，而且在大歌剧中也经住了考验。
    一九三二年，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基写道：“问题在于：要把化装的音乐会变成真正的戏剧表演。目前大部分歌剧都是这种化装的音乐会。因此就需要指出，根据我的意见，把歌剧分为歌唱的歌剧和音乐剧是没有道理的，因为每一个歌剧都是音乐剧。”
    “五月之夜”的演出是排演李姆斯基—科萨可夫歌剧工作的继续。“五月之夜”的音乐是建筑在乌克兰民间音乐的曲调上的。这个剧中的抒情的和诙谐的成分获得了再现，并且以新的方式歌唱出来。乌克兰农村的风俗习惯的全部特点都被表现出来。音乐的优美使年青的剧团得以创作出这个活泼愉快的剧目。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基也上演过童话歌剧。他在李姆斯基—科萨可夫的“金鸡”的演出里，注入了很大的创造性和异常丰富的想像。这个歌剧是作曲家在一九○五年革命事件的影响下写成的。这个歌剧表现了对专制制度的讽刺，并非常尖锐地指出了道顿帝国的愚蠢、懒惰和专横。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基又着手排演普希金的戏剧——莫索尔斯基的“鲍里斯·戈都诺夫”，这是剧院创作生活中的一项重大事件。歌剧是根据最熟悉莫索尔斯基的专家、拉姆教授所编的最初脚本上演的。斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基深刻地表现出普希金—莫索尔斯基的这个作品。在这个作品中，占首要地位的是活生生的积极活动着的人民。从第一景在诺沃皆维奇寺院附近到歌剧最后一景鲍里斯孤独的死亡为止，都强调地指出了沙皇和人民之间的鸿沟。
    莫索尔斯基的创作对斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科都是同样亲近的。一九三二年，聂米罗维奇—丹钦科所建立的音乐剧院上演了莫索尔斯基的歌剧“索罗钦市集”。这个歌剧没有严整的、完全的脚本，只是一些片断。拉姆教授和作曲家谢巴林共同做了巨大的工作，像莫索尔斯基所预想的那样重新上演了这个歌剧。莫索尔斯基看出了果戈理的最深刻的现实主义，而剧院把莫索尔斯基的音乐和果戈理的小说中所表现的鲜明手法和活生生的特点搬上了舞台。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科对古典作品的上演工作，在歌剧舞台上确定现实主义的事业中具有很大的意义；同时对于在音乐剧院舞台上体现现代的剧作来说，也是很重大的、严肃的准备工作。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科所宣布的创作现实主义的歌剧的原则，给予现代的全部歌剧艺术以巨大的影响，不仅在苏联，而且在国外也是如此。这个思想，成为苏维埃国家音乐剧院和培养歌剧演员与导演的学校的工作基础。
    斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科培育了整整一代苏联歌剧演员。其中许多人是从剧院诞生时起就开始了创造活动，并成为了歌剧艺术的大师。在剧院即将向中国观众演出的剧目中，青年人和著名的有经验的演员——康杰拉基、扬科、潘切新、蔡宁、斯米尔诺娃—聂米罗维奇、克尼茨基、科罗特科夫、库兹涅佐娃、瓦西里耶娃等人进行着创造性的紧密合作。通往艺术的康庄大道已为青年开拓出来了。青年演员波塔波夫斯卡娅、杜达列夫、布拉斯利斯、鲍里索娃、沙温斯基、马特维也夫、拉基耶夫斯基、拉萨林科、别列夫佐娃等人，已经在剧院中占了重要地位。对于他们和对于他们的青年同志们，已创造了一切使他们能在创作上进步和完善的条件。他们的活动是依靠老同志，依靠斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科的直接学生的经验。
    当剧院在中华人民共和国演出的时候，将上演“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”这个我们在演出古典歌剧中成绩最优秀的剧目。
