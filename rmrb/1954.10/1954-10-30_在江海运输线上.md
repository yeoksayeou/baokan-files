Awarded by the Ministry of Transportation
The Yangtze River Shipping Administration's Jiang'an vessel, the public-private joint venture Minsheng Shipping Company's Wuxia vessel, and the public-private joint venture Sichuan-Yangtze River Shipping Company's Huayuan vessel have recently been awarded commendations by the Ministry of Transportation. After studying the General Line and rectifying labor discipline, the crew members of these vessels have greatly enhanced their political awareness, consolidated labor discipline, and improved their operational skills. All have successfully completed their transportation tasks and created brilliant records of safe production. Among them, the Wuxia vessel has safely navigated over 105,000 kilometers, the Jiang'an vessel has safely navigated over 102,000 kilometers, and the Huayuan vessel has safely navigated over 77,000 kilometers.

Successful Trial of "Fast Shipping Line"
The "Fast Shipping Line" jointly piloted by the Shanghai Maritime Bureau, the Shanghai Port Authority, and the Qinhuangdao Branch of the Tianjin Port Authority between Qinhuangdao and Shanghai has been successful.

The fast shipping line is an advanced experience in Soviet shipping management. In August of this year, the Peace No. 1 vessel took the lead in learning from this experience. Fixed cargo types, fixed berthing locations, fixed loading and unloading times, and navigation times were implemented between the ports of Qinhuangdao and Shanghai, greatly improving vessel turnover efficiency. The Peace No. 1 and Xinghua vessels from Shanghai Port participating in the fast shipping line adopted the "fast loading and unloading" method. On the eve of National Day, the Peace No. 1 vessel created a new national record by unloading 8,600 tons of coal in 27 hours and 35 minutes. On October 19, the Xinghua vessel set a new coal unloading record, completing the unloading of 8,600 tons of coal in 26 and a half hours.

According to preliminary estimates, due to the establishment of the fast shipping line, taking only the Peace No. 1 vessel as an example, it can make six more round trips per year, increasing the transportation volume by more than 50,000 tons, increasing freight and handling fee income for the state by more than 5 billion yuan, and saving more than 10,000 man-days of loading and unloading labor in the two ports mentioned above.

Fully Exceeded the Third Quarter Plan
The Guangzhou Port Inland River Vessels under the Zhujiang River Shipping Administration have fully exceeded the national transportation plan for the third quarter of this year. The transportation business of the Guangzhou Port Inland River Vessels under the bureau has further developed in the third quarter of this year. Both freight volume and freight ton-kilometers have more than doubled compared with the same period last year, and passenger volume and passenger-kilometers have also increased by 50% to 100%. In the third quarter, the above-mentioned vessels transported large quantities of grain, timber, stone, mineral sand, and various fruits from the West River, the Pearl River Delta, and other places to Guangzhou, and also transported fertilizers, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and various industrial products from Guangzhou to the West River, the Pearl River Delta, and other places, playing a great role in promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

Inland river vessel workers held a workers' representative meeting from October 4th to 11th to discuss the transportation work for the fourth quarter and decided to launch a labor competition with technological innovation as the main content to strive for better completion of the national transportation plan for the fourth quarter and the entire year.

    在江海运输线上
    受到交通部明令嘉奖
    长江航运管理局江安轮、公私合营民生轮船公司巫峡轮、公私合营川江轮船公司华源轮最近荣获交通部明令嘉奖。这些轮船船员经过总路线及整顿劳动纪律的学习，政治觉悟大大提高，巩固了劳动纪律，提高了操作技术，都顺利地完成了运输任务，创造了安全生产的光辉纪录。其中巫峡轮安全航行十万五千多公里，江安轮安全航行十万二千多公里，华源轮安全航行七万七千多公里。
    试行“快速航线”成功
    由上海海运局、上海区港务管理局、天津区港务管理局秦皇岛分局联合试行的秦皇岛与上海之间的“快速航线”已经成功。
    快速航线是苏联航运管理的先进经验。今年八月份，和平一号轮首先学习这一经验。在秦皇岛和上海两港之间举行固定货种、固定停泊地点、固定装卸时间和航行时间，使船舶周转效率大大提高。上海港参加快速航线的和平一号、星华两只轮船采用了“快速装卸”方法后，和平一号轮在国庆节前夕创造二十七小时三十五分卸煤八千六百吨的全国新纪录，十月十九日，星华轮又创造了新的卸煤纪录，该轮在二十六小时半的时间内就卸完了八千六百吨煤炭。
    据初步估计，由于快速航线的建立，仅以和平一号轮计算，每年就能多跑六个来回，增加运输量五万多吨，给国家增加运费和装卸费收入五十多亿元，并可在上述两个港口节省装卸人工一万多个。
    全面超额完成第三季度计划
    珠江航运管理局所属广州港内河船舶全面超额完成了今年第三季度国家运输计划。该局所属广州港内河船舶今年第三季度的运输业务有了进一步的发展。货运量和货运吨公里都比去年同期增加了一倍以上，客运量和客运人公里也增加了百分之五十至百分之一百。第三季度中，上述船舶从西江、珠江三角洲等地运送了大批的粮食、木材、石料、矿砂和各种水果到广州，又从广州运送了肥料、棉纱、棉布和各种工业品到西江、珠江三角洲等地，对促进城乡物资交流起了很大作用。
    内河船舶职工于十月四日至十一日举行了职工代表会议，讨论了第四季度的运输工作，决定开展以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛，争取更好地完成第四季度和全年度的国家运输计划。（附图片）
